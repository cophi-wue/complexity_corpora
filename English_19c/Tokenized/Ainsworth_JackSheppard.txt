CHAPTER
I.
 
<EOS>
The
Widow
and
her
Child
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
night
of
Friday
,
the
26th
of
November
,
1703
,
and
at
the
hour
of
eleven
,
the
door
of
a
miserable
habitation
,
situated
in
an
obscure
quarter
of
the
Borough
of
Southwark
,
known
as
the
Old
Mint
,
was
opened
;
and
a
man
,
with
a
lantern
in
his
hand
,
appeared
at
the
threshold
.
<EOS>
This
person
,
whose
age
might
be
about
forty
,
was
attired
in
a
brown
double
-
breasted
frieze
coat
,
with
very
wide
skirts
,
and
a
very
narrow
collar
;
a
light
drugget
waistcoat
,
with
pockets
reaching
to
the
knees
;
black
plush
breeches
;
grey
worsted
hose
;
and
shoes
with
round
toes
,
wooden
heels
,
and
high
quarters
,
fastened
by
small
silver
buckles
.
<EOS>
He
wore
a
three
-
cornered
hat
,
a
sandy
-
coloured
scratch
wig
,
and
had
a
thick
woollen
wrapper
folded
round
his
throat
.
<EOS>
His
clothes
had
evidently
seen
some
service
,
and
were
plentifully
begrimed
with
the
dust
of
the
workshop
.
<EOS>
Still
he
had
a
decent
look
,
and
decidedly
the
air
of
one
well
-
to
-
do
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
In
stature
,
he
was
short
and
stumpy
;
in
person
,
corpulent
;
and
in
countenance
,
sleek
,
snub
-
nosed
,
and
demure
.
 
<EOS>
Immediately
behind
this
individual
,
came
a
pale
,
poverty
-
stricken
woman
,
whose
forlorn
aspect
contrasted
strongly
with
his
plump
and
comfortable
physiognomy
.
<EOS>
She
was
dressed
in
a
tattered
black
stuff
gown
,
discoloured
by
various
stains
,
and
intended
,
it
would
seem
,
from
the
remnants
of
rusty
crape
with
which
it
was
here
and
there
tricked
out
,
to
represent
the
garb
of
widowhood
,
and
held
in
her
arms
a
sleeping
infant
,
swathed
in
the
folds
of
a
linsey
-
woolsey
shawl
.
 
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
her
emaciation
,
her
features
still
retained
something
of
a
pleasing
expression
,
and
might
have
been
termed
beautiful
,
had
it
not
been
for
that
repulsive
freshness
of
lip
denoting
the
habitual
dram
-
drinker
;
a
freshness
in
her
case
rendered
the
more
shocking
from
the
almost
livid
hue
of
the
rest
of
her
complexion
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
be
more
than
twenty
;
and
though
want
and
other
suffering
had
done
the
work
of
time
,
had
wasted
her
frame
,
and
robbed
her
cheek
of
its
bloom
and
roundness
,
they
had
not
extinguished
the
lustre
of
her
eyes
,
nor
thinned
her
raven
hair
.
<EOS>
Checking
an
ominous
cough
,
that
,
ever
and
anon
,
convulsed
her
lungs
,
the
poor
woman
addressed
a
few
parting
words
to
her
companion
,
who
lingered
at
the
doorway
as
if
he
had
something
on
his
mind
,
which
he
did
not
very
well
know
how
to
communicate
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
good
night
,
Mr.
Wood
,
"
said
she
,
in
the
deep
,
hoarse
accents
of
consumption
;
"
and
may
God
Almighty
bless
and
reward
you
for
your
kindness
!
<EOS>
You
were
always
the
best
of
masters
to
my
poor
husband
;
and
now
you
've
proved
the
best
of
friends
to
his
widow
and
orphan
boy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Poh
!
<EOS>
poh
!
<EOS>
say
no
more
about
it
,
"
rejoined
the
man
hastily
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
done
no
more
than
my
duty
,
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
and
neither
deserve
nor
desire
your
thanks
.
'
<EOS>
Whoso
giveth
to
the
poor
lendeth
to
the
Lord
;
'
that
's
my
comfort
.
<EOS>
And
such
slight
relief
as
I
can
afford
should
have
been
offered
earlier
,
if
I
'd
known
where
you
'd
taken
refuge
after
your
unfortunate
husband's--
"
 
"
Execution
,
you
would
say
,
Sir
,
"
added
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
with
a
deep
sigh
,
perceiving
that
her
benefactor
hesitated
to
pronounce
the
word
.
<EOS>
"
You
show
more
consideration
to
the
feelings
of
a
hempen
widow
,
than
there
is
any
need
to
show
.
<EOS>
I
'm
used
to
insult
as
I
am
to
misfortune
,
and
am
grown
callous
to
both
;
but
I
'm
_
not
_
used
to
compassion
,
and
know
not
how
to
take
it
.
<EOS>
My
heart
would
speak
if
it
could
,
for
it
is
very
full
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
time
,
long
,
long
ago
,
when
the
tears
would
have
rushed
to
my
eyes
unbidden
at
the
bare
mention
of
generosity
like
yours
,
Mr.
Wood
;
but
they
never
come
now
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
wept
since
that
day
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
trust
you
will
never
have
occasion
to
weep
again
,
my
poor
soul
,
"
replied
Wood
,
setting
down
his
lantern
,
and
brushing
a
few
drops
from
his
eyes
,
"
unless
it
be
tears
of
joy
.
<EOS>
Pshaw
!
"
<EOS>
added
he
,
making
an
effort
to
subdue
his
emotion
<EOS>
,
"
I
ca
n't
leave
you
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
I
must
stay
a
minute
longer
,
if
only
to
see
you
smile
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
re
-
entered
the
house
,
closed
the
door
,
and
,
followed
by
the
widow
,
proceeded
to
the
fire
-
place
,
where
a
handful
of
chips
,
apparently
just
lighted
,
crackled
within
the
rusty
grate
.
 
<EOS>
The
room
in
which
this
interview
took
place
had
a
sordid
and
miserable
look
.
<EOS>
Rotten
,
and
covered
with
a
thick
coat
of
dirt
,
the
boards
of
the
floor
presented
a
very
insecure
footing
;
the
bare
walls
were
scored
all
over
with
grotesque
designs
,
the
chief
of
which
represented
the
punishment
of
Nebuchadnezzar
.
<EOS>
The
rest
were
hieroglyphic
characters
,
executed
in
red
chalk
and
charcoal
.
<EOS>
The
ceiling
had
,
in
many
places
,
given
way
;
the
laths
had
been
removed
;
and
,
where
any
plaster
remained
,
it
was
either
mapped
and
blistered
with
damps
,
or
festooned
with
dusty
cobwebs
.
<EOS>
Over
an
old
crazy
bedstead
was
thrown
a
squalid
,
patchwork
counterpane
;
and
upon
the
counterpane
lay
a
black
hood
and
scarf
,
a
pair
of
bodice
of
the
cumbrous
form
in
vogue
at
the
beginning
of
the
last
century
,
and
some
other
articles
of
female
attire
.
<EOS>
On
a
small
shelf
near
the
foot
of
the
bed
stood
a
couple
of
empty
phials
,
a
cracked
ewer
and
basin
,
a
brown
jug
without
a
handle
,
a

This

was
adorned
with
a
rude
wood

cut
,
representing
the
unhappy
malefactor
at

execution
.
<EOS>
On
one
side
of
the
handbill
a
print
of
the
reigning
sovereign
,
Anne
,
had
been
pinned
over
the
portrait
of
William
the
Third
,
whose
aquiline
nose
,
keen
eyes
,
and
luxuriant
wig
,
were
just
visible
above

,

was
styled
in

raised
a

was
not

Beneath

A
farthing
candle
,
stuck
in
a
bottle
neck
,
shed
its
feeble
light
upon
the
table
,
which
,
owing
to
the
provident
kindness
of
Mr.
Wood
,
was
much
better
furnished
with
eatables
than
might
have
been
expected
,
and
boasted
a

a

a

a

<EOS>
"
You

a

Mrs.

"
said
Wood
,
glancing
round
the
chamber
,
as
he
expanded
his
palms
before
the
scanty
flame
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
wretched
enough
,
indeed
,
Sir
,
"
rejoined
the
widow
;
"
but
,
poor
as
it
is
,
it
's
better
than
the
cold
stones
and
open
streets
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
--
of
course
,
"
returned
Wood
,
hastily
;
"
anything
's
better
than
that
.
<EOS>
But
take
a
drop
of
wine
,
"
urged
he
,
filling
a
drinking

horn
and
presenting
it
to
her
;
"
it
's
choice
canary
,
and'll
do
you
good

<EOS>
And
now
,
come
and
sit
by
me
,
my
dear
,
and
let
's
have
a
little
quiet
chat
together
.
<EOS>
When
things
are
at
the
worst
,
they
'll
mend
.
<EOS>
Take
my
word
for
it
,
your
troubles
are
over
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
they
are
,
Sir
,
"
answered
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
with
a
faint
smile
and
a
doubtful
shake
of
the
head
,
as
Wood
drew
her
to
a
seat
beside
him
,
"
for
I
've
had
my
full
share
of
misery
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
look
for
peace
on
this
side
the
grave
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Wood
;
"
while
there
's
life
there
's
hope
.
<EOS>
Never
be
down
-
hearted
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
"
added
he
,
opening
the
shawl
in
which
the
infant
was
wrapped
,
and
throwing
the
light
of
the
candle
full
upon
its
sickly
,
but
placid
features
,
"
<EOS>
it
's
sinful
to
repine
while
you
've
a
child
like
this
to
comfort
you
.
<EOS>
Lord
help
him
!
<EOS>
he
's
the
very
image
of
his
father
.
<EOS>
Like
carpenter
,
like
chips
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
likeness
is
the
chief
cause
of
my
misery
,
"
replied
the
widow
,
shuddering
.
<EOS>
"
Were
it
not
for
that
,
he
would
indeed
be
a
blessing
and
a
comfort
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
never
cries
nor
frets
,
as
children
generally
do
,
but
lies
at
my
bosom
,
or
on
my
knee
,
as
quiet
and
as
gentle
as
you
see
him
now
.
<EOS>
But
,
when
I
look
upon
his
innocent
face
,
and
see
how
like
he
is
to
his
father,--when
<EOS>
I
think
of
that
father
's
shameful
ending
,
and
recollect
how
free
from
guilt
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
he
_
<EOS>
once
was,--at
such
times
,
Mr.
Wood
,
despair
will
come
over
me
;
and
,
dear
as
this
babe
is
to
me
,
far
dearer
than
my
own
wretched
life
,
which
I
would
lay
down
for
him
any
minute
,
I
have
prayed
to
Heaven
to
remove
him
,
rather
than
he
should
grow
up
to
be
a
man
,
and
be
exposed
to
his
father
's
temptations
--
rather
than
he
should
live
as
wickedly
and
die
as
disgracefully
as
his
father
.
<EOS>
And
,
when
I
have
seen
him
pining
away
before
my
eyes
,
getting
thinner
and
thinner
every
day
,
I
have
sometimes
thought
my
prayers
were
heard
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Marriage
and
hanging
go
by
destiny
,
"
observed
Wood
,
after
a
pause
;
"
but
I
trust
your
child
is
reserved
for
a
better
fate
than
either
,
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
"
 
The
latter
part
of
this
speech
was
delivered
with
so
much
significance
of
manner
,
that
a
bystander
might
have
inferred
that
Mr.
Wood
was
not
particularly
fortunate
in
his
own
matrimonial
connections
.
 
<EOS>
"
Goodness
only
knows
what
he
's
reserved
for
,
"
rejoined
the
widow
in
a
desponding
tone
;
"
but
if
Mynheer
Van
Galgebrok
,
whom
I
met
last
night
at
the
Cross
Shovels
,
spoke
the
truth
,
little
Jack
will
never
die
in
his
bed
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Save
us
!
"
exclaimed
Wood
.
"
<EOS>
And
who
is
this
Van
Gal
--
Gal
<EOS>
--
what
's
his
outlandish
name
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Van
Galgebrok
,
"
replied
the
widow
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
the
famous
Dutch
conjuror
who
foretold
King
William
's
accident
and
death
,
last
February
but
one
,
a
month
before
either
event
happened
,
and
gave
out
that
another
prince
over
the
water
would
soon
enjoy
his
own
again
;
for
which
he
was
committed
to
Newgate
,
and
whipped
at
the
cart
's
tail
.
<EOS>
He
went
by
another
name
then,--Rykhart
Scherprechter
<EOS>
I
think
he
called
himself
.
<EOS>
His
fellow
-
prisoners
nicknamed
him
the
gallows
-
provider
,
from
a
habit
he
had
of
picking
out
all
those
who
were
destined
to
the
gibbet
.
<EOS>
He
was
never
known
to
err
,
and
was
as
much
dreaded
as
the
jail
-
fever
in
consequence
.
<EOS>
He
singled
out
my
poor
husband
from
a
crowd
of
other
felons
;
and
you
know
how
right
he
was
in
that
case
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
marry
,
"
replied
Wood
,
with
a
look
that
seemed
to
say
that
he
did
not
think
it
required
any
surprising
skill
in
the
art
of
divination
to
predict
the
doom
of
the
individual
in
question
;
but
whatever
opinion
he
might
entertain
,
he
contented
himself
with
inquiring
into
the
grounds
of
the
conjuror
's
evil
augury
respecting
the
infant
.
<EOS>
"
What
did
the
old
fellow
judge
from
,
eh
,
Joan
?
"
asked
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
From
a
black
mole
under
the
child
's
right
ear
,
shaped
like
a
coffin
,
which
is
a
bad
sign
;
and
a
deep
line
just
above
the
middle
of
the
left
thumb
,
meeting
round
about
in
the
form
of
a
noose
,
which
is
a
worse
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
,
it
's
not
surprising
the
poor
little
thing
should
be
so
marked
;
for
,
when
I
lay
in
the
women
-
felons
'
ward
in
Newgate
,
where
he
first
saw
the
light
,
or
at
least
such
light
as
ever
finds
entrance
into
that
gloomy
place
,
I
had
nothing
,
whether
sleeping
or
waking
,
but
halters
,
and
gibbets
,
and
coffins
,
and
such
like
horrible
visions
,
for
ever
dancing
round
me
!
<EOS>
And
then
,
you
know
,
Sir
--
<EOS>
but
,
perhaps
,
you
do
n't
know
that
little
Jack
was
born
,
a
month
before
his
time
,
on
the
very
day
his
poor
father
suffered
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Lord
bless
us
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Wood
,
"
how
shocking
!
<EOS>
No
,
I
did
_
<EOS>
not
_
know
that
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
see
the
marks
on
the
child
yourself
,
if
you
choose
,
Sir
,
"
urged
the
widow
.
 
<EOS>
"
See
the
devil!--not
I
,
"
cried
Wood
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
think
you
'd
been
so
easily
fooled
,
Joan
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Fooled
or
not
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Sheppard
mysteriously
,
"
old
Van
told
me
_
one
_
thing
which
has
come
true
already
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
?
"
asked
Wood
with
some
curiosity
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
said
,
by
way
of
comfort
,
I
suppose
,
after
the
fright
he
gave
me
at
first
,
that
the
child
would
find
a
friend
within
twenty
-
four
hours
,
who
would
stand
by
him
through
life
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
friend
is
not
so
soon
gained
as
lost
,
"
replied
Wood
;
"
but
how
has
the
prediction
been
fulfilled
,
Joan
,
eh
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
would
have
guessed
,
Sir
,
"
replied
the
widow
,
timidly
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
little
Jack
has
but
one
friend
beside
myself
,
in
the
world
,
and
that
's
more
than
I
would
have
ventured
to
say
for
him
yesterday
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
've
not
told
you
all
;
for
old
Van
_
did
_
say
something
about
the
child
saving
his
new
-
found
friend
's
life
at
the
time
of
meeting
;
but
how
that
's
to
happen
,
I
'm
sure
I
ca
n't
guess
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nor
any
one
else
in
his
senses
,
"
rejoined
Wood
,
with
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
very
likely
that
a
babby
of
nine
months
old
will
save
_
<EOS>
my
_
life
,
if
I
'm
to
be
his
friend
,
as
you
seem
to
say
,
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
But
I
've
not
promised
to
stand
by
him
yet
;
nor
will
I
,
unless
he
turns
out
an
honest
lad,--mind
<EOS>
that
.
<EOS>
Of
all
crafts,--and
<EOS>
it
was
the
only
craft
his
poor
father
,
who
,
to
do
him
justice
,
was
one
of
the
best
workmen
that
ever
handled
a
saw
or
drove
a
nail
,
<EOS>
could
never
understand,--of
all
crafts
,
I
say
,
to
be
an
honest
man
is
the
master
-
craft
.
<EOS>
As
long
as
your
son
observes
that
precept
I
'll
befriend
him
,
but
no
longer
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
desire
it
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
meekly
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
an
old
proverb
,
"
continued
Wood
,
rising
and
walking
towards
the
fire
,
"
which
says,--'Put
another
man
's
child
in
your
bosom
,
and
he
'll
creep
out
at
your
elbow
.
'
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
value
that
,
because
I
think
it
applies
to
one
who
marries
a
widow
with
encumbrances
;
and
that
's
not
my
case
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sir
,
"
gasped
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
dear
,
I
've
a
proposal
to
make
in
regard
to
this
babby
of
yours
,
which
may
,
or
may
not
,
be
agreeable
.
<EOS>
All
I
can
say
is
,
it
's
well
meant
;
and
I
may
add
,
I
'd
have
made
it
five
minutes
ago
,
if
you
'd
given
me
the
opportunity
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
come
to
the
point
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
somewhat
alarmed
by
this
preamble
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
_
am
_
coming
to
the
point
,
Joan
.
<EOS>
The
more
haste
,
the
worse
speed
--
better
the
feet
slip
than
the
tongue
.
<EOS>
However
,
to
cut
a
long
matter
short
,
my
proposal
's
this:--I've
taken
a
fancy
to
your
bantling
,
and
,
as
I
've
no
son
of
my
own
,
if
it
meets
with
your
concurrence
and
that
of
Mrs.
Wood
,
(
for
I
never
do
anything
without
consulting
my
better
half
,
)
<EOS>
I
'll
take
the
boy
,
educate
him
,
and
bring
him
up
to
my
own
business
of
a
carpenter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
poor
widow
hung
her
head
,
and
pressed
her
child
closer
to
her
breast
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Joan
,
"
said
the
benevolent
mechanic
,
after
he
had
looked
at
her
steadfastly
for
a
few
moments
,
"
what
say
you?--silence
gives
consent
,
eh
?
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Sheppard
made
an
effort
to
speak
,
but
her
voice
was
choked
by
emotion
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
take
the
babby
home
with
me
!
"
<EOS>
persisted
Wood
,
in
a
tone
between
jest
and
earnest
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
part
with
him
,
"
replied
the
widow
,
bursting
into
tears
;
"
indeed
,
indeed
,
I
can
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
I
've
found
out
the
way
to
move
her
,
"
thought
the
carpenter
;
"
those
tears
will
do
her
some
good
,
at
all
events
.
<EOS>
Not
part
with
him
!
"
added
he
aloud
.
<EOS>
"
Why
you
would
n't
stand
in
the
way
of
his
good
fortune
<EOS>
sure_ly
<EOS>
_
?
<EOS>
I
'll
be
a
second
father
to
him
,
I
tell
you
.
<EOS>
Remember
what
the
conjuror
said
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
_
do
_
remember
it
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
"
and
am
most
grateful
for
your
offer
.
<EOS>
But
I
dare
not
accept
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Dare
not
!
"
echoed
the
carpenter
;
"
I
do
n't
understand
you
,
Joan

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
say
,
Sir
,
"
answered
Mrs.
Sheppard
in
a
troubled
voice
,
"
that
if
I
lost
my
child
,
I
should
lose
all
I
have
left
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
I
have
neither
father
,
mother
,
brother
,
sister
,
nor
husband
--
I
have
only
_
<EOS>
him
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
ask
you
to
part
with
him
,
my
good
woman
,
it
's
to
better
his
condition
,
I
suppose
,
ai
n't
it
?
"
rejoined
Wood
angrily
;
for
,
though
he
had
no
serious
intention
of
carrying
his
proposal
into
effect
,
he
was
rather
offended
at
having
it
declined
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
an
offer
,
"
continued
he
,
"
that
I
'm
likely
to
make
,
or
you
're
likely
to
receive
every
day
in
the
year
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
muttering
some
remarks
,
which
we
do
not
care
to
repeat
,
reflecting
upon
the
consistency
of
the
sex
,
he
was
preparing
once
more
to
depart
,
when
Mrs.
Sheppard
stopped
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Give
me
till
to
-
morrow
,
"
implored
she
,
"
and
if
I
_
can
_
bring
myself
to
part
with
him
,
you
shall
have
him
without
another
word
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Take
time
to
consider
of
it
,
"
replied
Wood
sulkily
,
"
there
's
no
hurry
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
angry
with
me
,
Sir
,
"
cried
the
widow
,
sobbing
bitterly
,
"
pray
do
n't
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
am
undeserving
of
your
bounty
;
but
if
I
were
to
tell
you
what
hardships
<EOS>
I
have
undergone
--
to
what
frightful
extremities
I
have
been
reduced
--
and
to
what
infamy
I
have
submitted
,
to
earn
a
scanty
subsistence
for
this
child
's
sake,--if
you
could
feel
what
it
is
to
stand
alone
in
the
world
as
I
do
,
bereft
of
all
who
have
ever
loved
me
,
and
shunned
by
all
who
have
ever
known
me
,
except
the
worthless
and
the
wretched,--if
<EOS>
you
knew
(
and
<EOS>
Heaven
grant
you
may
be
spared
the
knowledge
!
)
<EOS>
how
much
affliction
sharpens
love
,
and
how
much
more
dear
to
me
<EOS>
my
child
has
become
for
every
sacrifice
I
have
made
for
him,--if
you
were
told
all
this
,
you
would
,
I
am
sure
,
pity
rather
than
reproach
me
,
because
I
can
not
at
once
consent
to
a
separation
,
which
I
feel
would
break
my
heart
.
<EOS>
But
give
me
till
to
-
morrow
--
only
till
to
-
morrow
--
I
may
be
able
to
part
with
him
then
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
worthy
carpenter
was
now
far
more
angry
with
himself
than
he
had
previously
been
with
Mrs.
Sheppard
;
and
,
as
soon
as
he
could
command
his
feelings
,
which
were
considerably
excited
by
the
mention
of
her
distresses
,
he
squeezed
her
hand
warmly
,
bestowed
a
hearty
execration
upon
his
own
inhumanity
,
and
swore
he
would
neither
separate
her
from
her
child
,
nor
suffer
any
one
else
to
separate
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
Plague
on't
!
<EOS>
"
added
he
:
"
I
never
meant
to
take
your
babby
from
you
.
<EOS>
But
I
'd
a
mind
to
try
whether
you
really
loved
him
as
much
as
you
pretended
.
<EOS>
I
was
to
blame
to
carry
the
matter
so
far
.
<EOS>
However
,
confession
of
a
fault
makes
half
amends
for
it
.
<EOS>
A
time
_
may
_
come
when
this
little
chap
will
need
my
aid
,
and
,
depend
upon
it
,
he
shall
never
want
a
friend
in
Owen
Wood
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
said
this
,
the
carpenter
patted
the
cheek
of
the
little
object
of
his
benevolent
professions
,
and
,
in
so
doing
,
unintentionally
aroused
him
from
his
slumbers
.
<EOS>
Opening
a
pair
of
large
black
eyes
,
the
child
fixed
them
for
an
instant
upon
Wood
,
and
then
,
alarmed
by
the
light
,
uttered
a
low
and
melancholy
cry
,
which
,
however
,
was
speedily
stilled
by
the
caresses
of
his
mother
,
towards
whom
he
extended
his
tiny
arms
,
as
if
imploring
protection
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
he
would
leave
me
,
even
if
I
could
part
with
him
,
"
observed
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
smiling
through
her
tears
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
he
would
,
"
acquiesced
the
carpenter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
friend
like
the
mother
,
for
the
babby
knows
no
other
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
that
's
true
,
"
rejoined
Mrs.
Sheppard
;
"
for
if
I
had
_
not
_
been
a
mother
,
I
would
not
have
survived
the
day
on
which
I
became
a
widow
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
n't
think
of
that
,
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
"
said
Wood
in
a
soothing
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
help
thinking
of
it
,
Sir
,
"
answered
the
widow
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
never
get
poor
Tom
's
last
look
out
of
my
head
,
as
he
stood
in
the
Stone
-
Hall
at
Newgate
,
after
his
irons
had
been
knocked
off
,
unless
I
manage
to
stupify
myself
somehow
.
<EOS>
The
dismal
tolling
of
St.
Sepulchre
's
bell
is
for
ever
ringing
in
my
ears
--
oh
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
that
's
the
case
,
"
observed
Wood
,
"
I
'm
surprised
you
should
like
to
have
such
a
frightful
picture
constantly
in
view
as
that
over
the
chimney
-
piece
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'd
good
reasons
for
placing
it
there
,
Sir
;
but
do
n't
question
me
about
them
now
,
or
you
'll
drive
me
mad
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Sheppard
wildly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
we
'll
say
no
more
about
it
,
"
replied
Wood
;
"
and
,
by
way
of
changing
the
subject
,
let
me
advise
you
on
no
account
to
fly
to
strong
waters
for
consolation
,
Joan
.
<EOS>
One
nail
drives
out
another
,
it
's
true
;
but
the
worst
nail
you
can
employ
is
a
coffin
-
nail
.
<EOS>
Gin
Lane
's
the
nearest
road
to
the
churchyard
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
;
but
if
it
shortens
the
distance
and
lightens
the
journey
,
I
care
not
,
"
retorted
the
widow
,
who
seemed
by
this
reproach
to
be
roused
into
sudden
eloquence
.
"
<EOS>
To
those
who
,
like
me
,
have
never
been
able
to
get
out
of
the
dark
and
dreary
paths
of
life
,
the
grave
is
indeed
a
refuge
,
and
the
sooner
they
reach
it
the
better
.
<EOS>
The
spirit
I
drink
may
be
poison,--it
may
kill
me,--perhaps
<EOS>
it
<EOS>
_
is
_
killing
me:--but
<EOS>
so
would
hunger
,
cold
<EOS>
,
misery,--so
would
my
own
thoughts
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
gone
mad
without
it
.
<EOS>
Gin
is
the
poor
man
's
friend,--his
sole
set
-
off
against
the
rich
man
's
luxury
.
<EOS>
It
comforts
him
when
he
is
most
forlorn
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
treacherous
,
it
may
lay
up
a
store
of
future
woe
;
but
it
insures
present
happiness
,
and
that
is
sufficient
.
<EOS>
When
I
have
traversed
the
streets
a
houseless
wanderer
,
driven
with
curses
from
every
door
where
I
have
solicited
alms
,
and
with
blows
from
every
gateway
where
I
have
sought
shelter,--when
<EOS>
I
have
crept
into
some
deserted
building
,
and
stretched
my
wearied
limbs
upon
a
bulk
,
in
the
vain
hope
of
repose,--or
,
worse
than
all
,
when
,
frenzied
with
want
,
I
have
yielded
to
horrible
temptation
,
and
earned
a
meal
in
the
only
way
I
could
earn
<EOS>
one,--when
<EOS>
I
have
felt
,
at
times
like
these
,
my
heart
sink
within
me
,
I
have
drank
of
this
drink
,
and
have
at
once
forgotten
my
cares
,
my
poverty
,
my
guilt
.
<EOS>
Old
thoughts
,
old
feelings
,
old
faces
,
and
old
scenes
have
returned
to
me
,
and
I
have
fancied
myself
<EOS>
happy,--as
happy
as
I
am
now
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
she
burst
into
a
wild
hysterical
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
creature
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Wood
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
call
this
frantic
glee
happiness
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
the
happiness
I
have
known
for
years
,
"
returned
the
widow
,
becoming
suddenly
calm
,
"
and
it
's
short
-
lived
enough
,
as
you
perceive
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
what
,
Mr.
Wood
,
"
added
she
in
a
hollow
voice
,
and
with
a
ghastly
look
,
"
gin
may
bring
ruin
;
but
as
long
as
poverty
,
vice
,
and
ill
-
usage
exist
,
it
will
be
drunk
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
God
forbid
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Wood
,
fervently
;
and
,
as
if
afraid
of
prolonging
the
interview
,
he
added
,
with
some
precipitation
,
"
<EOS>
But
I
must
be
going
<EOS>
:
I
've
stayed
here
too
long
already
.
<EOS>
You
shall
hear
from
me
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Stay
!
"
said
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
again
arresting
his
departure
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
just
recollected
that
my
husband
left
a
key
with
me
,
which
he
charged
me
to
give
you
when
I
could
find
an
opportunity
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
key
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Wood
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"
I
lost
a
very
valuable
one
some
time
ago
.
<EOS>
What
's
it
like
,
Joan
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
small
key
,
with
curiously
-
fashioned
wards
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
mine
,
I
'll
be
sworn
,
"
rejoined
Wood
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
who
'd
have
thought
of
finding
it
in
this
unexpected
way
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
too
sure
till
you
see
it
,
"
said
the
widow
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
I
fetch
it
for
you
,
Sir
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
By
all
means
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
trouble
you
to
hold
the
child
,
then
,
for
a
minute
,
while
I
run
up
to
the
garret
,
where
I
've
hidden
it
for
safety
,
"
said
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
_
may
_
trust
him
with
you
,
Sir
,
"
added
she
,
taking
up
the
candle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
leave
him
,
if
you
're
at
all
fearful
,
my
dear
,
"
replied
Wood
,
receiving
the
little
burthen
with
a
laugh
.
"
Poor
thing
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
he
,
as
the
widow
departed
on
her
errand
,
"
she
's
seen
better
days
and
better
circumstances
than
she
'll
ever
see
again
,
I
'm
sure
.
<EOS>
Strange
,
I
could
never
learn
her
history
.
<EOS>
Tom
Sheppard
was
always
a
close
file
,
and
would
never
tell
whom
he
married
.
<EOS>
Of
this
I
'm
certain
,
however
,
she
was
much
too
good
for
him
,
and
was
never
meant
to
be
a
journeyman
carpenter
's
wife
,
still
less
what
is
she
now
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
's
in
the
right
place
,
at
all
events
;
and
,
since
that
's
the
case
,
the
rest
may
perhaps
come
round,--that
is
,
if
she
gets
through
her
present
illness
.
<EOS>
A
dry
cough
's
the
trumpeter
of
death
.
<EOS>
If
that
's
true
,
she
's
not
long
for
this
world
.
<EOS>
As
to
this
little
fellow
,
in
spite
of
the
Dutchman
,
who
,
in
my
opinion
,
is
more
of
a
Jacobite
than
a
conjurer
,
and
more
of
a
knave
than
either
,
he
shall
never
mount
a
horse
foaled
by
an
acorn
,
if
I
can
help
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
course
of
the
carpenter
's
meditations
was
here
interrupted
by
a
loud
note
of
lamentation
from
the
child
,
who
,
disturbed
by
the
transfer
,
and
not
receiving
the
gentle
solace
to
which
he
was
ordinarily
accustomed
,
raised
his
voice
to
the
utmost
,
and
exerted
his
feeble
strength
to
escape
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
moments
Mr.
Wood
dandled
his
little
charge
to
and
fro
,
after
the
most
approved
nursery
fashion
,
essaying
at
the
same
time
the
soothing
influence
of
an
infantine
melody
proper
to
the
occasion
;
but
,
failing
in
his
design
,
he
soon
lost
all
patience
,
and
being
,
as
we
have
before
hinted
,
rather
irritable
,
though
extremely
well
-
meaning
,
he
lifted
the
unhappy
bantling
in
the
air
,
and
shook
him
with
so
much
good
will
,
that
he
had
well
-
nigh
silenced
him
most
effectually
.
<EOS>
A
brief
calm
succeeded
.
<EOS>
But
with
returning
breath
came
returning
vociferations
;
and
the
carpenter
,
with
a
faint
hope
of
lessening
the
clamour
by
change
of
scene
,
took
up
his
lantern
,
opened
the
door
,
and
walked
out
.

CHAPTER
II
.
 
<EOS>
The
Old
Mint
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Sheppard
's
habitation
terminated
a
row
of
old
ruinous
buildings
,
called
Wheeler
's
Rents
;
a
dirty
thoroughfare
,
part
street
,
and
part
lane
,
running
from
Mint
Street
,
through
a
variety
of
turnings
,
and
along
the
brink
of
a
deep
kennel
,
skirted
by
a
number
of
petty
and
neglected
gardens
in
the
direction
of
Saint
George
's
Fields
.
<EOS>
The
neighbouring
houses
were
tenanted
by
the
lowest
order
of
insolvent
traders
,
thieves
,
mendicants
,
and
other
worthless
and
nefarious
characters
,
who
fled
thither
to
escape
from
their
creditors
,
or
to
avoid
the
punishment
due
to
their
different
offenses
;
for
we
may
observe
that
the
Old
Mint
,
although
it
had
been
divested
of
some
of
its
privileges
as
a
sanctuary
by
a
recent
statute
passed
in
the
reign
of
William
the
Third
,
still
presented
a
safe
asylum
to
the
debtor
,
and
even
continued
to
do
so
until
the
middle
of
the
reign
of
George
the
First
,
when
the
crying
nature
of
the
evil
called
loudly
for
a
remedy
,
and
another
and
more
sweeping
enactment
entirely
took
away
its
immunities
.
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
the
encouragement
thus
offered
to
dishonesty
,
and
the
security
afforded
to
crime
,
this
quarter
of
the
Borough
of
Southwark
was
accounted
(
at
the
period
of
our
narrative
)
<EOS>
the
grand
receptacle
of
the
superfluous
villainy
of
the
metropolis
.
<EOS>
Infested
by
every
description
of
vagabond
and
miscreant
,
it
was
,
perhaps
,
a
few
degrees
worse
than
the
rookery
near
Saint
Giles
's
and
the
desperate
neighbourhood
of
Saffron
Hill
in
our
own
time
.
<EOS>
And
yet
,
on
the
very
site
of
the
sordid
tenements
and
squalid
courts
we
have
mentioned
,
where
the
felon
openly
made
his
dwelling
,
and
the
fraudulent
debtor
laughed
the
object
of
his
knavery
to
scorn
--
on
this
spot
,
not
two
centuries
ago
,
stood
the
princely
residence
of
Charles
Brandon
,
the
chivalrous
Duke
of
Suffolk
,
whose
stout
heart
was
a
well
of
honour
,
and
whose
memory
breathes
of
loyalty
and
valour
.
<EOS>
Suffolk
House
,
as
Brandon
's
palace
was
denominated
,
was
subsequently
converted
into
a
mint
by
his
royal
brother
-
in
-
law
,
Henry
the
Eighth
;
and
,
after
its
demolition
,
and
the
removal
of
the
place
of
coinage
to
the
Tower
,
the
name
was
still
continued
to
the
district
in
which
it
had
been
situated
.
 
<EOS>
Old
and
dilapidated
,
the
widow
's
domicile
looked
the
very
picture
of
desolation
and
misery
.
<EOS>
Nothing
more
forlorn
could
be
conceived
.
<EOS>
The
roof
was
partially
untiled
;
the
chimneys
were
tottering
;
the
side
-
walls
bulged
,
and
were
supported
by
a
piece
of
timber
propped
against
the
opposite
house
;
the
glass
in
most
of
the
windows
was
broken
,
and
its
place
supplied
with
paper
;
while
,
in
some
cases
,
the
very
frames
of
the
windows
had
been
destroyed
,
and
the
apertures
were
left
free
to
the
airs
of
heaven
.
<EOS>
On
the
groundfloor
the
shutters
were
closed
,
or
,
to
speak
more
correctly
,
altogether
nailed
up
,
and
presented
a
very
singular
appearance
,
being
patched
all
over
with
the
soles
of
old
shoes
,
rusty
hobnails
,
and
bits
of
iron
hoops
,
the
ingenious
device
of
the
former
occupant
of
the
apartment
,
Paul
Groves
,
the
cobbler
,
to
whom
we
have
before
alluded
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
owing
to
the
untimely
end
of
this
poor
fellow
that
Mrs.
Sheppard
was
enabled
to
take
possession
of
the
premises
.
<EOS>
In
a
fit
of
despondency
,
superinduced
by
drunkenness
,
he
made
away
with
himself
;
and
when
the
body
was
discovered
,
after
a
lapse
of
some
months
,
such
was
the
impression
produced
by
the
spectacle
--
such
the
alarm
occasioned
by
the
crazy
state
of
the
building
,
and
,
above
all
,
by
the
terror
inspired
by
strange
and
unearthly
noises
heard
during
the
night
,
which
were
,
of
course
,
attributed
to
the
spirit
of
the
suicide
,
that
the
place
speedily
enjoyed
the
reputation
of
being
haunted
,
and
was
,
consequently
,
entirely
abandoned
.
<EOS>
In
this
state
Mrs.
Sheppard
found
it
;
and
,
as
no
one
opposed
her
,
she
at
once
took
up
her
abode
there
;
nor
was
she
long
in
discovering
that
the
dreaded
sounds
proceeded
from
the
nocturnal
gambols
of
a
legion
of
rats
.
 
<EOS>
A
narrow
entry
,
formed
by
two
low
walls
,
communicated
with
the
main
thoroughfare
;
and
in
this
passage
,
under
the
cover
of
a
penthouse
,
stood
Wood
,
with
his
little
burthen
,
to
whom
we
shall
now
return
.
 
<EOS>
As
Mrs.
Sheppard
did
not
make
her
appearance
quite
so
soon
as
he
expected
,
the
carpenter
became
a
little
fidgetty
,
and
,
having
succeeded
in
tranquillizing
the
child
,
he
thought
proper
to
walk
so
far
down
the
entry
as
would
enable
him
to
reconnoitre
the
upper
windows
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
A
light
was
visible
in
the
garret
,
feebly
struggling
through
the
damp
atmosphere
,
for
the
night
was
raw
and
overcast
.
<EOS>
This
light
did
not
remain
stationary
,
but
could
be
seen
at
one
moment
glimmering
through
the
rents
in
the
roof
,
and
at
another
shining
through
the
cracks
in
the
wall
,
or
the
broken
panes
of
the
casement
.
<EOS>
Wood
was
unable
to
discover
the
figure
of
the
widow
,
but
he
recognised
her
dry
,
hacking
cough
,
and
was
about
to
call
her
down
,
if
she
could
not
find
the
key
,
as
he
imagined
must
be
the
case
,
when
a
loud
noise
was
heard
,
as
though
a
chest
,
or
some
weighty
substance
,
had
fallen
upon
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
Before
Wood
had
time
to
inquire
into
the
cause
of
this
sound
,
his
attention
was
diverted
by
a
man
,
who
rushed
past
the
entry
with
the
swiftness
of
desperation
.
<EOS>
This
individual
apparently
met
with
some
impediment
to
his
further
progress
;
for
he
had
not
proceeded
many
steps
when
he
turned
suddenly
about
,
and
darted
up
the
passage
in
which
Wood
stood
.
 
<EOS>
Uttering
a
few
inarticulate
<EOS>
ejaculations,--for
he
was
completely
out
of
breath,--the
fugitive
placed
a
bundle
in
the
arms
of
the
carpenter
,
and
,
regardless
of
the
consternation
he
excited
in
the
breast
of
that
personage
,
who
was
almost
stupified
with
astonishment
,
he
began
to
divest
himself
of
a
heavy
horseman
's
cloak
,
which
he
threw
over
Wood
's
shoulder
,
and
,
drawing
his
sword
,
<EOS>
seemed
to
listen
intently
for
the
approach
of
his
pursuers
.
 
<EOS>
The
appearance
of
the
new
-
comer
was
extremely
prepossessing
;
and
,
after
his
trepidation
had
a
little
subsided
,
Wood
began
to
regard
him
with
some
degree
of
interest
.
<EOS>
Evidently
in
the
flower
of
his
age
,
he
was
scarcely
less
remarkable
for
symmetry
of
person
than
for
comeliness
of
feature
;
and
,
though
his
attire
was
plain
and
unpretending
,
it
was
such
as
could
be
worn
only
by
one
belonging
to
the
higher
ranks
of
society
.
<EOS>
His
figure
was
tall
and
commanding
,
and
the
expression
of
his
countenance
(
though
somewhat
disturbed
by
his
recent
exertion
)
was
resolute
and
stern
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
a
cry
burst
from
the
child
,
who
,
nearly
smothered
by
the
weight
imposed
upon
him
,
only
recovered
the
use
of
his
lungs
as
Wood
altered
the
position
of
the
bundle
.
<EOS>
The
stranger
turned
his
head
at
the
sound
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
Heaven
!
"
cried
he
in
a
tone
of
surprise
,
"
you
have
an
infant
there
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
I
have
,
"
replied
Wood
,
angrily
;
for
,
finding
that
the
intentions
of
the
stranger
were
pacific
,
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
,
he
thought
he
might
safely
venture
on
a
slight
display
of
spirit
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
well
you
have
n't
crushed
the
poor
little
thing
to
death
with
this
confounded
clothes'-bag
.
<EOS>
But
some
people
have
no
consideration
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
child
may
be
the
means
of
saving
me
,
"
muttered
the
stranger
,
as
if
struck
by
a
new
idea
:
"
I
shall
gain
time
by
the
expedient
.
<EOS>
Do
you
live
here
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
exactly
,
"
answered
the
carpenter
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
matter
.
<EOS>
The
door
is
open
,
so
it
is
needless
to
ask
leave
to
enter
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
stranger
,
as
shouts
and
other
vociferations
resounded
at
no
great
distance
along
the
thoroughfare
,
"
not
a
moment
is
to
be
lost
.
<EOS>
Give
me
that
precious
charge
,
"
he
added
,
snatching
the
bundle
from
Wood
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
escape
,
I
will
reward
you
.
<EOS>
Your
name
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Owen
Wood
,
"
replied
the
carpenter
;
"
I
've
no
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
it
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
a
fair
exchange
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
Yours
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
stranger
hesitated
.
<EOS>
The
shouts
drew
nearer
,
and
lights
were
seen
flashing
ruddily
against
the
sides
and
gables
of
the
neighbouring
houses
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
name
is
Darrell
,
"
said
the
fugitive
hastily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
if
you
are
discovered
,
answer
no
questions
,
as
you
value
your
life
.
<EOS>
Wrap
yourself
in
my
cloak
,
and
keep
it
.
<EOS>
Remember
!
<EOS>
not
a
word
!
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
huddled
the
mantle
over
Wood
's
shoulders
,
dashed
the
lantern
to
the
ground
,
and
extinguished
the
light
.
<EOS>
A
moment
afterwards
,
the
door
was
closed
and
bolted
,
and
the
carpenter
found
himself
alone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mercy
on
us
!
"
<EOS>
cried
he
,
as
a
thrill
of
apprehension
ran
through
his
frame
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Dutchman
was
right
,
after
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
exclamation
had
scarcely
escaped
him
,
when
the
discharge
of
a
pistol
was
heard
,
and
a
bullet
whizzed
past
his
ears
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
him
!
"
<EOS>
cried
a
voice
in
triumph
.
 
<EOS>
A
man
,
then
,
rushed
up
the
entry
,
and
,
seizing
the
unlucky
carpenter
by
the
collar
,
presented
a
drawn
sword
to
his
throat
.
<EOS>
This
person
was
speedily
followed
by
half
a
dozen
others
,
some
of
whom
carried
flambeaux
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mur
--
der
!
"
<EOS>
roared
Wood
,
struggling
to
free
himself
from
his
assailant
,
by
whom
he
was
half
strangled
.
 
<EOS>
"
Damnation
!
"
exclaimed
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
party
in
a
furious
tone
,
snatching
a
torch
from
an
attendant
,
and
throwing
its
light
full
upon
the
face
of
the
carpenter
;
"
this
is
not
the
villain
,
Sir
Cecil
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
I
find
,
Rowland
,
"
replied
the
other
,
in
accents
of
deep
disappointment
,
and
at
the
same
time
relinquishing
his
grasp
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
have
sworn
I
saw
him
enter
this
passage
.
<EOS>
And
how
comes
his
cloak
on
this
knave
's
shoulders
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
his
cloak
,
of
a
surety
,
"
returned
Rowland
"
Harkye
,
sirrah
,
"
<EOS>
continued
he
,
haughtily
interrogating
Wood
;
"
where
is
the
person
from
whom
you
received
this
mantle
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Throttling
a
man
is
n't
the
way
to
make
him
answer
questions
,
"
replied
the
carpenter
,
doggedly
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
get
nothing
out
of
me
<EOS>
,
I
can
promise
you
,
unless
you
show
a
little
more
civility
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
waste
time
with
this
fellow
,
"
interposed
Sir
Cecil
,
"
and
may
lose
the
object
of
our
quest
,
who
,
beyond
doubt
,
has
taken
refuge
in
this
building
.
<EOS>
Let
us
search
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
Just
then
,
the
infant
began
to
sob
piteously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hist
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Rowland
,
arresting
his
comrade
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
hear
that
!
<EOS>
We
are
not
wholly
at
fault
.
<EOS>
The
dog
-
fox
can
not
be
far
off
,
since
the
cub
is
found
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
he
tore
the
mantle
from
Wood
's
back
,
and
,
perceiving
the
child
,
endeavoured
to
seize
it
.
<EOS>
In
this
attempt
he
was
,
however
,
foiled
by
the
agility
of
the
carpenter
,
who
managed
to
retreat
to
the
door
,
against
which
he
placed
his
back
,
kicking
the
boards
vigorously
with
his
heel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Joan
!
<EOS>
Joan
!
"
<EOS>
vociferated
he
,
"
open
the
door
,
for
God
's
sake
,
or
I
shall
be
murdered
,
and
so
will
your
babby
!
<EOS>
Open
the
door
quickly
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Knock
him
on
the
head
,
"
thundered
Sir
Cecil
,
"
or
we
shall
have
the
watch
upon
us
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
fear
of
that
,
"
rejoined
Rowland
:
"
such
vermin
never
dare
to
show
themselves
in
this
privileged
district
.
<EOS>
All
we
have
to
apprehend
is
a
rescue
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
hint
was
not
lost
upon
Wood
.
<EOS>
He
tried
to
raise
an
outcry
,
but
his
throat
was
again
forcibly
griped
by
Rowland
.
 
<EOS>
"
Another
such
attempt
,
"
said
the
latter
,
"
and
you
are
a
dead
man
.
<EOS>
Yield
up
the
babe
,
and
I
pledge
my
word
you
shall
remain
unmolested
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
yield
it
to
no
one
but
its
mother
,
"
answered
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Sdeath
!
<EOS>
do
you
trifle
with
me
,
sirrah
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Rowland
fiercely
.
"
<EOS>
Give
me
the
child
,
or--
"
 
As
he
spoke
the
door
was
thrown
open
,
and
Mrs.
Sheppard
staggered
forward
.
<EOS>
She
looked
paler
than
ever
;
but
her
countenance
,
though
bewildered
,
did
not
exhibit
the
alarm
which
might
naturally
have
been
anticipated
from
the
strange
and
perplexing
scene
presented
to
her
view
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
it
,
"
cried
Wood
,
holding
the
infant
towards
her
;
"
take
it
,
and
fly
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Sheppard
put
out
her
arms
mechanically
.
<EOS>
But
before
the
child
could
be
committed
to
her
care
,
it
was
wrested
from
the
carpenter
by
Rowland
.
 
<EOS>
"
These
people
are
all
in
league
with
him
,
"
cried
the
latter
.
<EOS>
"
But
do
n't
wait
for
me
,
Sir
Cecil
.
<EOS>
Enter
the
house
with
your
men
.
<EOS>
I
'll
dispose
of
the
brat
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
injunction
was
instantly
obeyed
.
<EOS>
The
knight
and
his
followers
crossed
the
threshold
,
leaving
one
of
the
torch
-
bearers
behind
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
Davies
,
"
said
Rowland
,
delivering
the
babe
,
with
a
meaning
look
,
to
his
attendant
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
understand
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Davies
,
drawing
a
little
aside
.
<EOS>
And
,
setting
down
the
link
,
he
proceeded
deliberately
to
untie
his
cravat
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
God
!
will
you
see
your
child
strangled
before
your
eyes
,
and
not
so
much
as
scream
for
help
?
"
said
Wood
,
staring
at
the
widow
with
a
look
of
surprise
and
horror
.
<EOS>
"
Woman
,
your
wits
are
fled
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
so
it
seemed
;
for
all
the
answer
she
could
make
was
to
murmur
distractedly
,
"
I
ca
n't
find
the
key
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Devil
take
the
key
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Wood
.
<EOS>
"
They
're
about
to
murder
your
child--_your
_
child
,
I
tell
you
!
<EOS>
Do
you
comprehend
what
I
say
,
Joan
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
hurt
my
head
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
pressing
her
hand
to
her
temples
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
,
for
the
first
time
,
Wood
noticed
a
small
stream
of
blood
coursing
slowly
down
her
cheek
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
Davies
,
who
had
completed
his
preparations
,
extinguished
the
torch
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
over
,
"
groaned
Wood
,
"
and
perhaps
it
's
<EOS>
as
well
her
senses
are
gone
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
'll
make
a
last
effort
to
save
the
poor
little
creature
,
if
it
costs
me
my
life
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
with
this
generous
resolve
,
he
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
,
"
Arrest
!
<EOS>
arrest
!
<EOS>
help
!
<EOS>
help
!
"
<EOS>
seconding
the
words
with
a
shrill
and
peculiar
cry
,
well
known
at
the
time
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
quarter
in
which
it
was
uttered
.
 
<EOS>
In
reply
to
this
summons
a
horn
was
instantly
blown
at
the
corner
of
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
"
Arrest
!
"
<EOS>
vociferated
Wood
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mint
!
<EOS>
Mint
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Death
and
hell
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Rowland
,
making
a
furious
pass
at
the
carpenter
,
who
fortunately
avoided
the
thrust
in
the
darkness
;
"
will
nothing
silence
you
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Help
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Wood
,
renewing
his
cries
.
<EOS>
"
Arrest
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Jigger
closed
!
"
shouted
a
hoarse
voice
in
reply
.
<EOS>
"
All
's
bowman
,
my
covey
.
<EOS>
Fear
nothing
.
<EOS>
We
'll
be
upon
the
ban
-
dogs
before
they
can
shake
their
trotters
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
the
alarm
was
sounded
more
loudly
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
Another
horn
now
resounded
from
the
further
extremity
of
the
thoroughfare
;
this
was
answered
by
a
third
;
and
presently
a
fourth
,
and
more
remote
blast
,
took
up
the
note
of
alarm
.
<EOS>
The
whole
neighbourhood
was
disturbed
.
<EOS>
A
garrison
called
to
arms
at
dead
of
night
on
the
sudden
approach
of
the
enemy
,
could
not
have
been
more
expeditiously
,
or
effectually
aroused
.
<EOS>
Rattles
were
sprung
;
lanterns
lighted
,
and
hoisted
at
the
end
of
poles
<EOS>
;
windows
thrown
open
;
doors
unbarred
;
and
,
as
if
by
magic
,
the
street
was
instantaneously
filled
with
a
crowd
of
persons
of
both
sexes
,
armed
with
such
weapons
as
came
most
readily
to
hand
,
and
dressed
in
such
garments
as
could
be
most
easily
slipped
on
.
<EOS>
Hurrying
in
the
direction
of
the
supposed
arrest
,
they
encouraged
each
other
with
shouts
,
and
threatened
the
offending
parties
with
their
vengeance
.
 
<EOS>
Regardless
as
the
gentry
of
the
Mint
usually
were
(
for
,
indeed
,
they
had
become
habituated
from
their
frequent
occurrence
to
such
scenes
,
)
of
any
outrages
committed
in
their
streets
;
deaf
,
as
they
had
been
,
to
the
recent
scuffle
before
Mrs.
Sheppard
's
door
,
they
were
always
sufficiently
on
the
alert
to
maintain
their
privileges
,
and
to
assist
each
other
against
the
attacks
of
their
common
enemy
--
the
sheriff
's
officer
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
by
the
adoption
of
such
a
course
(
especially
since
the
late
act
of
suppression
,
to
which
we
have
alluded
,
)
that
the
inviolability
of
the
asylum
could
be
preserved
.
<EOS>
Incursions
were
often
made
upon
its
territories
by
the
functionaries
of
the
law
;
sometimes
attended
with
success
,
but
more
frequently
with
discomfiture
;
and
it
rarely
happened
,
unless
by
stratagem
or
bribery
,
that
(
in
the
language
of
the
gentlemen
of
the
short
staff
)
an
important
caption
could
be
effected
.
<EOS>
In
order
to
guard
against
accidents
or
surprises
,
watchmen
,
or
scouts
,
(
as
they
were
styled
,
)
were
stationed
at
the
three
main
outlets
of
the
sanctuary
ready
to
give
the
signal
in
the
manner
<EOS>
just
described
:
bars
were
erected
,
which
,
in
case
of
emergency
;
could
be
immediately
stretched
across
the
streets
:
doors
were
attached
to
the
alleys
;
and
were
never
opened
without
due
precautions
;
gates
were
affixed
to
the
courts
,
wickets
to
the
gates
,
and
bolts
to
the
wickets
.
<EOS>
The
back
windows
of
the
houses
(
where
any
such
existed
)
were
strongly
barricaded
,
and
kept
constantly
shut
;
and
the
fortress
was
,
furthermore
,
defended
by
high
walls
and
deep
ditches
in
those
quarters
where
it
appeared
most
exposed
.
<EOS>
There
was
also
a
Maze
,
(
the
name
is
still
retained
in
the
district
,
)
into
which
the
debtor
could
run
,
and
through
the
intricacies
of
which
it
was
impossible
for
an
officer
to
follow
him
,
without
a
clue
.
<EOS>
Whoever
chose
to
incur
the
risk
of
so
doing
might
enter
the
Mint
at
any
hour
;
but
no
one
was
suffered
to
depart
without
giving
a
satisfactory
account
of
himself
,
or
producing
a
pass
from
the
Master
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
every
contrivance
that
ingenuity
could
devise
was
resorted
to
by
this
horde
of
reprobates
to
secure
themselves
from
danger
or
molestation
.
<EOS>
Whitefriars
had
lost
its
privileges
;
Salisbury
Court
and
the
Savoy
no
longer
offered
places
of
refuge
to
the
debtor
;
and
it
was
,
therefore
,
<EOS>
doubly
requisite
that
the
Island
of
Bermuda
(
as
the
Mint
was
termed
by
its
occupants
)
<EOS>
should
uphold
its
rights
,
as
long
as
it
was
able
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Wood
,
meantime
,
had
not
remained
idle
.
<EOS>
Aware
that
not
a
moment
was
to
be
lost
,
if
he
meant
to
render
any
effectual
assistance
to
the
child
,
he
ceased
shouting
,
and
defending
himself
in
the
best
way
he
could
from
the
attacks
of
Rowland
,
by
whom
he
was
closely
pressed
,
forced
his
way
,
in
spite
of
all
opposition
,
to
Davies
,
and
dealt
him
a
blow
on
the
head
with
such
good
will
that
,
had
it
not
been
for
the
intervention
of
the
wall
,
the
ruffian
must
have
been
prostrated
.
<EOS>
Before
he
could
recover
from
the
stunning
effects
of
the
blow
,
Wood
possessed
himself
of
the
child
:
and
,
untying
the
noose
which
had
been
slipped
round
its
throat
,
had
the
satisfaction
of
hearing
it
cry
lustily
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
Sir
Cecil
and
his
followers
appeared
at
the
threshold
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
escaped
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
knight
;
"
we
have
searched
every
corner
of
the
house
without
finding
a
trace
of
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Back
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Rowland
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
hear
those
shouts
?
<EOS>
Yon
fellow
's
clamour
has
brought
the
whole
horde
of
jail
-
birds
and
cut
-
throats
that
infest
this
place
about
our
ears
.
<EOS>
We
shall
be
torn
in
pieces
if
we
are
discovered
.
<EOS>
Davies
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
calling
to
the
attendant
,
who
was
menacing
Wood
with
a
severe
retaliation
,
"
do
n't
heed
him
;
but
,
if
you
value
a
whole
skin
,
come
into
the
house
,
and
bring
that
woman
with
you
.
<EOS>
She
may
afford
us
some
necessary
information
.
"
 
<EOS>
Davies
reluctantly
complied
.
<EOS>
And
,
dragging
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
who
made
no
resistance
,
along
with
him
,
entered
the
house
,
the
door
of
which
was
instantly
shut
and
barricaded
.
 
<EOS>
A
moment
afterwards
,
the
street
was
illumined
by
a
blaze
of
torchlight
,
and
a
tumultuous
uproar
,
mixed
with
the
clashing
of
weapons
,
and
the
braying
of
horns
,
announced
the
arrival
of
the
first
detachment
of
Minters
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Wood
rushed
instantly
to
meet
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hurrah
!
"
shouted
he
,
waving
his
hat
triumphantly
over
his
head
.
"
<EOS>
Saved
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
it
's
all
bob
,
my
covey
!
<EOS>
You
're
safe
enough
,
that
's
certain
!
<EOS>
"
responded
the
Minters
,
baying
,
yelping
,
leaping
,
and
howling
around
him
like
a
pack
of
hounds
when
the
huntsman
is
beating
cover
;
"
but
,
where
are
the
lurchers
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Who
?
"
asked
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
traps
!
"
responded
a
bystander
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
shoulder
-
clappers
!
<EOS>
"
added
a
lady
,
who
,
in
her
anxiety
to
join
the
party
,
had
unintentionally
substituted
her
husband
's
nether
habiliments
for
her
own
petticoats
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
ban
-
dogs
!
"
thundered
a
tall
man
,
whose
stature
and
former
avocations
had
procured
him
the
nickname
of
"
The
long
drover
of
the
Borough
market
.
"
<EOS>
"
Where
are
they
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
where
are
they
?
<EOS>
"
chorussed
the
mob
,
flourishing
their
various
weapons
,
and
flashing
their
torches
in
the
air
;
"
we
'll
starve
'em
out
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Wood
trembled
.
<EOS>
He
felt
he
had
raised
a
storm
which
it
would
be
very
difficult
,
if
not
impossible
,
to
allay
.
<EOS>
He
knew
not
what
to
say
,
or
what
to
do
;
and
his
confusion
was
increased
by
the
threatening
gestures
and
furious
looks
of
the
ruffians
in
his
immediate
vicinity
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
understand
you
,
gentlemen
,
"
stammered
he
,
at
length
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
does
he
say
?
<EOS>
"
roared
the
long
drover
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
says
he
do
n't
understand
flash
,
"
replied
the
lady
in
gentleman
's
attire
.
 
<EOS>
"
Cease
your
confounded
clutter
!
"
said
a
young
man
,
whose
swarthy
visage
,
seen
in
the
torchlight
,
struck
Wood
as
being
that
of
a
Mulatto
.
<EOS>
"
You
frighten
the
cull
out
of
his
senses
.
<EOS>
It
's
plain
he
do
n't
understand
our
lingo
;
as
,
how
should
he
?
<EOS>
Take
pattern
by
me
;
"
and
as
he
said
this
he
strode
up
to
the
carpenter
,
and
,
slapping
him
on
the
shoulder
,
propounded
the
following
questions
,
accompanying
each
interrogation
with
a
formidable
contortion
of
countenance
.
<EOS>
"
Curse
you
!
<EOS>
Where
are
the
bailiffs
?
<EOS>
Rot
you
!
<EOS>
have
you
lost
your
tongue
?
<EOS>
Devil
seize
you
!
<EOS>
you
could
bawl
loud
enough
a
moment
ago
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Silence
,
Blueskin
!
"
interposed
an
authoritative
voice
,
immediately
behind
the
ruffian
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Let
me
have
a
word
with
the
cull
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
<EOS>
ay
!
"
<EOS>
cried
several
of
the
bystanders
,
"
let
Jonathan
kimbaw
the
cove
.
<EOS>
He
's
got
the
gift
of
the
gab
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
crowd
accordingly
drew
aside
,
and
the
individual
,
in
whose
behalf
the
movement
had
been
made
immediately
stepped
forward
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
young
man
of
about
two
-
and
-
twenty
,
who
,
without
having
anything
remarkable
either
in
dress
or
appearance
,
was
yet
a
noticeable
person
,
if
only
for
the
indescribable
expression
of
cunning
pervading
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
small
and
grey
;
as
far
apart
and
as
sly
-
looking
as
those
of
a
fox
.
<EOS>
A
physiognomist
,
indeed
,
would
have
likened
him
to
that
crafty
animal
,
and
it
must
be
owned
the
general
formation
of
his
features
favoured
such
a
comparison
.
<EOS>
The
nose
was
long
and
sharp
,
the
chin
pointed
,
the
forehead
broad
and
flat
,
and
connected
,
without
any
intervening
hollow
,
with
the
eyelid
;
the
teeth
when
displayed
,
seemed
to
reach
from
ear
to
ear
.
<EOS>
Then
his
beard
was
of
a
reddish
hue
,
and
his
complexion
warm
and
sanguine
.
<EOS>
Those
who
had
seen
him
slumbering
,
averred
that
he
slept
with
his
eyes
open
.
<EOS>
But
this
might
be
merely
a
figurative
mode
of
describing
his
customary
vigilance
.
<EOS>
Certain
it
was
,
that
the
slightest
sound
aroused
him
.
<EOS>
This
astute
personage
was
somewhat
under
the
middle
size
,
but
fairly
proportioned
,
inclining
rather
to
strength
than
symmetry
,
and
abounding
more
in
muscle
than
in
flesh
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
seem
,
from
the
attention
which
he
evidently
bestowed
upon
the
hidden
and
complex
machinery
of
the
grand
system
of
villany
at
work
around
him
,
that
his
chief
object
in
taking
up
his
quarters
in
the
Mint
,
must
have
been
to
obtain
some
private
information
respecting
the
habits
and
practices
of
its
inhabitants
,
to
be
turned
to
account
hereafter
.
 
<EOS>
Advancing
towards
Wood
,
Jonathan
fixed
his
keen
gray
eyes
upon
him
,
and
demanded
,
in
a
stern
tone
whether
the
persons
who
had
taken
refuge
in
the
adjoining
house
,
were
bailiffs
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
that
I
know
of
,
"
replied
the
carpenter
,
who
had
in
some
degree
recovered
his
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
I
presume
you
've
not
been
arrested
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
,
"
answered
Wood
firmly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
guessed
as
much
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
'll
next
inform
us
why
you
have
occasioned
this
disturbance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Because
this
child
's
life
was
threatened
by
the
persons
you
have
mentioned
,
"
rejoined
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
"
An
excellent
reason
,
i
'
faith
!
"
exclaimed
Blueskin
,
with
a
roar
of
surprise
and
indignation
,
which
was
echoed
by
the
whole
assemblage
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
we
're
to
be
summoned
from
our
beds
and
snug
firesides
,
because
a
kid
happens
to
squall
,
eh
?
<EOS>
By
the
soul
of
my
grandmother
,
but
this
is
too
good
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
intend
to
claim
the
privileges
of
the
Mint
?
"
said
Jonathan
,
calmly
pursuing
his
interrogations
amid
the
uproar
.
<EOS>
"
Is
your
person
in
danger
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
from
my
creditors
,
"
replied
Wood
,
significantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
he
post
the
cole
?
<EOS>
Will
he
come
down
with
the
dues
?
<EOS>
Ask
him
that
?
"
cried
Blueskin
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
hear
,
"
pursued
Jonathan
;
"
my
friend
desires
to
know
if
you
are
willing
to
pay
your
footing
as
a
member
of
the
ancient
and
respectable
fraternity
of
debtors
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
owe
no
man
a
farthing
,
and
my
name
shall
never
appear
in
any
such
rascally
list
,
"
replied
Wood
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
why
I
should
be
obliged
to
pay
for
doing
my
duty
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
this
child
would
have
been
strangled
.
<EOS>
The
noose
was
at
its
throat
when
I
called
for
help
.
<EOS>
I
knew
it
was
in
vain
to
cry
'
murder
!
'
<EOS>
in
the
Mint
,
so
I
had
recourse
to
stratagem
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sir
,
I
must
say
you
deserve
some
credit
for
your
ingenuity
,
at
all
events
,
"
replied
Jonathan
,
repressing
a
smile
;
"
but
,
before
you
put
out
your
foot
so
far
,
it
would
have
been
quite
as
prudent
to
consider
how
you
were
to
draw
it
back
again
.
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
do
n't
see
in
what
way
it
is
to
be
accomplished
,
except
by
the
payment
of
our
customary
fees
.
<EOS>
Do
not
imagine
you
can
at
one
moment
avail
yourself
of
our
excellent
regulations
(
with
which
you
seem
sufficiently
well
acquainted
)
,
and
the
next
break
them
with
impunity
.
<EOS>
If
you
assume
the
character
of
a
debtor
for
your
own
convenience
,
you
must
be
content
to
maintain
it
for
ours
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
not
been
arrested
,
we
have
been
disturbed
;
and
it
is
but
just
and
reasonable
you
should
pay
for
occasioning
such
disturbance
.
<EOS>
By
your
own
showing
you
are
in
easy
<EOS>
circumstances,--for
<EOS>
it
is
only
natural
to
presume
that
a
man
who
owes
nothing
must
be
in
a
condition
to
pay
liberally,--and
<EOS>
you
can
not
therefore
feel
the
loss
of
such
a
trifle
as
ten
guineas
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
However
illogical
and
inconclusive
these
arguments
might
appear
to
Mr.
Wood
,
and
however
he
might
dissent
from
the
latter
proposition
<EOS>
,
he
did
not
deem
it
expedient
to
make
any
reply
;
and
the
orator
proceeded
with
his
harangue
amid
the
general
applause
of
the
assemblage
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
perhaps
exceeding
my
authority
in
demanding
so
slight
a
sum
,
"
continued
Jonathan
,
modestly
,
"
and
the
Master
of
the
Mint
may
not
be
disposed
to
let
you
off
so
lightly
.
<EOS>
He
will
be
here
in
a
moment
or
so
,
and
you
will
then
learn
his
determination
.
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
let
me
advise
you
as
a
friend
not
to
irritate
him
by
a
refusal
,
which
would
be
as
useless
as
vexatious
.
<EOS>
He
has
a
very
summary
mode
of
dealing
with
refractory
persons
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
My
best
endeavours
shall
be
used
to
bring
you
off
,
on
the
easy
terms
I
have
mentioned
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
call
ten
guineas
easy
terms
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Wood
,
with
a
look
of
dismay
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
should
expect
to
purchase
the
entire
freehold
of
the
Mint
for
less
money
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Many
a
man
has
been
glad
to
pay
double
the
amount
to
get
his
head
from
under
the
Mint
pump
,
"
<EOS>
observed
Blueskin
,
gruffly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
the
gentleman
take
his
own
course
,
"
said
Jonathan
,
mildly
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
sorry
to
persuade
him
to
do
anything
his
calmer
judgment
might
disapprove
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Exactly
my
sentiments
,
"
rejoined
Blueskin
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
n't
force
him
for
the
world
:
but
if
he
do
n't
tip
the
stivers
,
may
I
be
cursed
if
he
do
n't
get
a
taste
of
the
_
aqua
pompaginis
_
.
<EOS>
Let
's
have
a
look
at
the
kinchen
that
_
ought
_
to
have
been
throttled
,
"
added
he
,
snatching
the
child
from
Wood
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
stars
!
<EOS>
here
's
a
pretty
lullaby
-
cheat
to
make
a
fuss
about
--
ho
!
ho
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Deal
with
me
as
you
think
proper
,
gentlemen
,
"
exclaimed
Wood
;
"
but
,
for
mercy
's
sake
do
n't
harm
the
child
!
<EOS>
Let
it
be
taken
to
its
mother
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
who
is
its
mother
?
"
asked
Jonathan
,
in
an
eager
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
frankly
,
and
speak
under
your
breath
.
<EOS>
Your
own
safety
--
the
child
's
safety
--
depends
upon
your
candour
.
"
 
<EOS>
While
Mr.
Wood
underwent
this
examination
,
Blueskin
felt
a
small
and
trembling
hand
placed
upon
his
own
,
and
,
turning
at
the
summons
,
beheld
a
young
female
,
whose
features
were
partially
concealed
by
a
loo
,
or
half
mask
,
standing
beside
him
.
<EOS>
Coarse
as
were
the
ruffian
's
notions
of
feminine
beauty
,
he
could
not
be
insensible
to
the
surpassing
loveliness
of
the
fair
creature
,
who
had
thus
solicited
his
attention
.
<EOS>
Her
figure
was
,
in
some
measure
,
hidden
by
a
large
scarf
,
and
a
deep
hood
drawn
over
the
head
contributed
to
her
disguise
;
still
it
was
evident
,
from
her
lofty
bearing
,
that
she
had
nothing
in
common
,
except
an
interest
in
their
proceedings
,
with
the
crew
by
whom
she
was
surrounded
.
 
<EOS>
Whence
<EOS>
she
<EOS>
came,--who
<EOS>
she
was,--and
what
she
<EOS>
wanted,--were
questions
which
naturally
suggested
themselves
to
Blueskin
,
and
he
was
about
to
seek
for
some
explanation
,
when
his
curiosity
was
checked
by
a
gesture
of
silence
from
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
in
a
low
,
but
agitated
voice
;
"
would
you
earn
this
purse
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
no
objection
,
"
replied
Blueskin
,
in
a
tone
intended
to
be
gentle
,
but
which
sounded
like
the
murmuring
whine
of
a
playful
bear
.
<EOS>
"
How
much
is
there
in
it
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
contains
gold
,
"
replied
the
lady
;
"
but
I
will
add
this
ring
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
am
I
to
do
to
earn
it
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Blueskin
,
with
a
disgusting
leer,--"cut
a
throat
--
or
throw
myself
at
your
feet
--
eh
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Give
me
that
child
,
"
returned
the
lady
,
with
difficulty
overcoming
the
loathing
inspired
by
the
ruffian
's
familiarity
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
I
see
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Blueskin
,
winking
significantly
,
"
Come
nearer
,
or
they
'll
observe
us
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
afraid
<EOS>
--
I
wo
n't
hurt
you
.
<EOS>
I
'm
always
agreeable
to
the
women
,
bless
their
kind
hearts
!
<EOS>
Now
!
<EOS>
slip
the
purse
into
my
hand
.
<EOS>
Bravo!--the
best
cly
-
faker
of
'em
all
could
n't
have
done
it
better
.
<EOS>
And
now
for
the
fawney
--
the
ring
I
mean
.
<EOS>
I
'm
no
great
judge
of
these
articles
,
Ma'am
;
but
I
trust
to
your
honour
not
to
palm
off
paste
upon
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
diamond
,
"
said
the
lady
,
in
an
agony
of
distress,--"the
child
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
diamond
!
<EOS>
Here
,
take
the
kid
,
"
cried
Blueskin
,
slipping
the
infant
adroitly
under
her
scarf
.
"
<EOS>
And
so
this
is
a
diamond
,
"
added
he
,
contemplating
the
brilliant
from
the
hollow
of
his
hand
:
"
it
does
sparkle
almost
as
brightly
as
your
ogles
.
<EOS>
By
the
by
,
my
dear
,
I
forgot
to
ask
your
name
--
perhaps
you
'll
oblige
me
with
it
now
?
<EOS>
Hell
and
the
devil!--gone
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
looked
around
in
vain
.
<EOS>
The
lady
had
disappeared
.

CHAPTER
III
.
 
<EOS>
The
Master
of
the
Mint
.
  
<EOS>
Jonathan
,
meanwhile
,
having
ascertained
the
parentage
of
the
child
from
Wood
,
proceeded
to
question
him
in
an
under
tone
,
as
to
the
probable
motives
of
the
attempt
upon
its
life
;
and
,
though
he
failed
in
obtaining
any
information
on
this
point
,
he
had
little
difficulty
in
eliciting
such
particulars
of
the
mysterious
transaction
as
have
already
been
recounted
.
<EOS>
When
the
carpenter
concluded
his
recital
,
Jonathan
was
for
a
moment
lost
in
reflection
.
 
<EOS>
"
Devilish
strange
!
"
<EOS>
thought
he
,
chuckling
to
himself
;
"
queer
business
!
<EOS>
Capital
trick
of
the
cull
in
the
cloak
to
make
another
person
's
brat
stand
the
brunt
for
his
own
--
capital
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
Wo
n't
do
,
though
.
<EOS>
He
must
be
a
sly
fox
to
get
out
of
the
Mint
without
my
knowledge
.
<EOS>
I
've
a
shrewd
guess
where
he
's
taken
refuge
;
but
I
'll
ferret
him
out
.
<EOS>
These
bloods
will
pay
well
for
his
capture
;
if
not
,
_
he
'll
_
pay
well
to
get
out
of
their
hands
;
so
I
'm
safe
either
way
--
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
Blueskin
,
"
he
added
aloud
,
and
motioning
that
worthy
,
"
follow
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
Upon
which
,
he
set
off
in
the
direction
of
the
entry
.
<EOS>
His
progress
,
however
,
was
checked
by
loud
acclamations
,
announcing
the
arrival
of
the
Master
of
the
Mint
and
his
train
.
 
<EOS>
Baptist
Kettleby
(
for
so
was
the
Master
named
)
was
a
"
goodly
portly
man
,
and
a
corpulent
,
"
<EOS>
whose
fair
round
paunch
bespoke
the
affection
he
entertained
for
good
liquor
and
good
living
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
quick
,
shrewd
,
merry
eye
,
and
a
look
in
which
duplicity
was
agreeably
veiled
by
good
humour
.
<EOS>
It
was
easy
to
discover
that
he
was
a
knave
,
but
equally
easy
to
perceive
that
he
was
a
pleasant
fellow
;
a
combination
of
qualities
by
no
means
of
rare
occurrence
.
<EOS>
So
far
as
regards
his
attire
,
Baptist
was
not
seen
to
advantage
.
<EOS>
No
great
lover
of
state
or
state
costume
at
any
time
,
he
was
generally
,
towards
the
close
of
an
evening
,
completely
in
dishabille
,
and
in
this
condition
he
now
presented
himself
to
his
subjects
.
<EOS>
His
shirt
was
unfastened
,
his
vest
unbuttoned
,
his
hose
ungartered
;
his
feet
were
stuck
into
a
pair
of
pantoufles
,
his
arms
into
a
greasy
flannel
dressing
-
gown
,
his
head
into
a
thrum
-
cap
,
the
cap
into
a
tie
-
periwig
,
and
the
wig
into
a
gold
-
edged
hat
.
<EOS>
A
white
apron
was
tied
round
his
waist
,
and
into
the
apron
was
thrust
a
short
thick
truncheon
,
which
looked
very
much
like
a
rolling
-
pin
.
 
<EOS>
The
Master
of
the
Mint
was
accompanied
by
another
gentleman
almost
as
portly
as
himself
,
and
quite
as
deliberate
in
his
movements
.
<EOS>
The
costume
of
this
personage
was
somewhat
singular
,
and
might
have
passed
for
a
masquerading
habit
,
had
not
the
imperturbable
gravity
of
his
demeanour
forbidden
any
such
supposition
.
<EOS>
It
consisted
of
a
close
jerkin
of
brown
frieze
,
ornamented
with
a
triple
row
of
brass
buttons
;
loose
Dutch
slops
,
made
very
wide
in
the
seat
and
very
tight
at
the
knees
;
red
stockings
with
black
clocks
,
and
a
fur
cap
.
<EOS>
The
owner
of
this
dress
had
a
broad
weather
-
beaten
face
,
small
twinkling
eyes
,
and
a
bushy
,
grizzled
beard
.
<EOS>
Though
he
walked
by
the
side
of
the
governor
,
he
seldom
exchanged
a
word
with
him
,
but
appeared
wholly
absorbed
in
the
contemplations
inspired
by
a
broadbowled
Dutch
pipe
.
 
<EOS>
Behind
the
illustrious
personages
<EOS>
just
described
marched
a
troop
of
stalwart
fellows
,
with
white
badges
in
their
hats
,
quarterstaves
,
oaken
cudgels
,
and
links
in
their
hands
.
<EOS>
These
were
the
Master
's
body
-
guard
.
 
<EOS>
Advancing
towards
the
Master
,
and
claiming
an
audience
,
which
was
instantly
granted
,
Jonathan
,
without
much
circumlocution
,
related
the
sum
of
the
strange
story
he
had
just
learnt
from
Wood
,
omitting
nothing
except
a
few
trifling
particulars
,
which
he
thought
it
politic
to
keep
back
;
and
,
with
this
view
,
he
said
not
a
word
of
there
being
any
probability
of
capturing
the
fugitive
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
roundly
asserted
that
his
informant
had
witnessed
that
person
's
escape
.
 
<EOS>
The
Master
listened
,
with
becoming
attention
,
to
the
narrative
,
and
,
at
its
conclusion
,
shook
his
head
gravely
,
applied
his
thumb
to
the
side
of
his
nose
,
and
,
twirling
his
fingers
significantly
,
winked
at
his
phlegmatic
companion
.
<EOS>
The
gentleman
appealed
to
shook
his
head
in
reply
,
coughed
as
only
a
Dutchman
_
can
_
cough
,
and
raising
his
hand
from
the
bowl
of
his
pipe
,
went
through
precisely
the
same
mysterious
ceremonial
as
the
Master
.
 
<EOS>
Putting
his
own
construction
upon
this
mute
interchange
of
opinions
,
Jonathan
ventured
to
observe
,
that
it
certainly
was
a
very
perplexing
case
,
but
that
he
thought
something
_
might
_
be
made
of
it
,
and
,
if
left
to
him
,
he
would
undertake
to
manage
the
matter
to
the
Master
's
entire
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ja
,
ja
,
Muntmeester
,
"
said
the
Dutchman
,
removing
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
,
and
speaking
in
a
deep
and
guttural
voice
,
"
leave
the
affair
to
Johannes
.
<EOS>
He
'll
settle
it
bravely

<EOS>
And

<EOS>
"
If
the
child
_
is
_
destined
to
the
gibbet
,
Van
Galgebrok
,
"
replied
the
Master
,
joining
in
the
laugh
,
"
it
'll
never
be
choked
by
a
footman
's
cravat
,
that
's
certain
;
but

in
regard
to
going

empty
-

"
continued
he
,
altering
his
tone
,
and
assuming
a
dignified
air
,
"
it
's
quite
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
With
Baptist
Kettleby
,
to
engage
in
a
matter
is
to
go
through
with
it
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
this
is
an
affair
which
no
one
but
myself
can
settle
.
<EOS>
Common
offences
may
be
decided
upon
by
deputy
;
but
outrages
perpetrated
by
men
of
rank
,
as
these
appear
to
be
,
must
be
judged
by
the
Master
of
the
Mint
in
person
.
<EOS>
These
are
the
decrees
of
the
Island
of
Bermuda
,
and
I
will
never
suffer
its
excellent
laws
to
be
violated
.
<EOS>
Gentlemen
of
the
Mint
,
"
added
he
,
pointing
with
his
truncheon
towards
Mrs.
Sheppard
's
house
,
"
forward
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hurrah
!
"
shouted
the
mob
,
and
the
whole
phalanx
was
put
in
motion
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
moment
a
martial
flourish
,
proceeding
from
cow
's
horns
,
tin
canisters
filled
with
stones
,
bladders
and
cat
-
gut
,
with
other
sprightly
,
instruments
,
was
struck
up
,
and
,
enlivened
by
this
harmonious
accompaniment
,
the
troop
reached
its
destination
in
the
best
possible
spirits
for
an
encounter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
us
in
,
"
said
the
Master
,
rapping
his
truncheon
authoritatively
against
the
boards
,
"
or
we
'll
force
an
entrance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
But
as
no
answer
was
returned
to
the
summons
,
though
it
was
again
,
and
more
peremptorily
,
repeated
,
Baptist
seized
a
mallet
from
a
bystander
and
burst
open
the
door
.
<EOS>
Followed
by
Van
Galgebrok
and
others
of
his
retinue
,
he
then
rushed
into
the
room
,
where
Rowland
,
Sir
Cecil
,
and
their
attendants
,
stood
with
drawn
swords
prepared
to
receive
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
Beat
down
their
blades
,
"
cried
the
Master
;
"
no
bloodshed
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Beat
out
their
brains
,
you
mean
,
"
rejoined
Blueskin
with
a
tremendous
imprecation
;
"
no
half
measures
now
,
Master
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Had
n't
you
better
hold
a
moment
's
parley
with
the
gentlemen
before
proceeding
to
extremities
?
"
suggested
Jonathan
.
 
<EOS>
"
Agreed
,
"
responded
the
Master
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Surely
,
"
he
added
,
staring
at
Rowland
,
"
<EOS>
either
I
'm
greatly
mistaken
,
or
it
is--
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
mistaken
,
Baptist
,
"
returned
Rowland
with
a
gesture
of
silence
;
"
it
is
your
old
friend
.
<EOS>
I
'm
glad
to
recognise
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
'm
glad
your
worship
's
recognition
does
n't
come
too
late
,
"
observed
the
Master
.
<EOS>
"
But
why
did
n't
you
make
yourself
known
at
once
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'd
forgotten
the
office
you
hold
in
the
Mint
,
Baptist
,
"
replied
Rowland
.
"
<EOS>
But
clear
the
room
of
this
rabble
,
if
you
have
sufficient
authority
over
them
.
<EOS>
I
would
speak
with
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
but
one
way
of
clearing
it
,
your
worship
,
"
said
the
Master
,
archly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
understand
,
"
replied
Rowland
.
"
<EOS>
Give
them
what
you
please
.
<EOS>
I
'll
repay
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
right
,
pals
,
"
cried
Baptist
,
in
a
loud
tone
;
"
the
gentlemen
and
I
have
settled
matters
.
<EOS>
No
more
scuffling
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
meaning
of
all
this
?
"
demanded
Sir
Cecil
.
<EOS>
"
How
have
you
contrived
to
still
these
troubled
waters
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
chanced
upon
an
old
ally
in
the
Master
of
the
Mint
,
"
answered
Rowland
.
<EOS>
"
We
may
trust
him
,
"
he
added
in
a
whisper
;
"
he
is
a
staunch
friend
of
the
good
cause
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Blueskin
,
clear
the
room
,
"
cried
the
Master
;
"
these
gentlemen
would
be
private
.
<EOS>
They
've
_
paid
_
for
their
lodging
.
<EOS>
Where
's
Jonathan
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Inquiries
were
instantly
made
after
that
individual
,
but
he
was
nowhere
to
be
found
.
 
<EOS>
"
Strange
!
"
observed
the
Master
;
"
I
thought
he
'd
been
at
my
elbow
all
this
time
.
<EOS>
But
it
do
n't
much
matter
--
though
he
's
a
devilish
shrewd
fellow
,
and
might
have
helped
me
out
of
a
difficulty
,
had
any
occurred
.
<EOS>
Hark
ye
,
Blueskin
,
"
continued
he
,
addressing
that
personage
,
who
,
in
obedience
to
his
commands
,
had
,
with
great
promptitude
,
driven
out
the
rabble
,
and
again
secured
the
door
,
"
a
word
in
your
ear
.
<EOS>
What
female
entered
the
house
with
us
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Blood
and
thunder
!
"
exclaimed
Blueskin
,
afraid
<EOS>
,
if
he
admitted
having
seen
the
lady
,
of
being
compelled
to
divide
the
plunder
he
had
obtained
from
her
among
his
companions
,
"
how
should
I
know
?
<EOS>
D'ye
suppose
I
'm
always
thinking
of
the
petticoats
?
<EOS>
I
observed
no
female
;
but
if
any
one
_
did
_
join
the
assault
,
it
must
have
been
either
Amazonian
Kate
,
or
Fighting
Moll
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
woman
I
mean
did
not
join
the
assault
,
"
rejoined
the
Master
,
"
but
rather
seemed
to
shun
observation
;
and
,
from
the
hasty
glimpse
I
caught
of
her
,
she
appeared
to
have
a
child
in
her
arms
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
,
most
probably
,
it
was
the
widow
Sheppard
,
"
answered
Blueskin
,
sulkily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Right
,
"
said
the
Master
,
"
I
did
n't
think
of
her
.
<EOS>
And
now
I
've
another
job
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Propose
it
,
"
returned
Blueskin
,
inclining
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
Square
accounts
with
the
rascal
who
got
up
the
sham
arrest
;
and
,
if
he
do
n't
tip
the
cole
without
more
ado
,
give
him
a
taste
of
the
pump
,
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
shall
go
through
the
whole
course
,
"
replied
Blueskin
,
with
a
ferocious
grin
,
"
unless
he
comes
down
to
the
last
grig
.
<EOS>
We
'll
lather
him
with
mud
,
shave
him
with
a
rusty
razor
,
and
drench
him
with
_
aqua
pompaginis
_
.
<EOS>
Master
,
your
humble
servant.--Gentlemen
,
your
most
obsequious
trout
.
"
 
<EOS>
Having
effected
his
object
,
which
was
to
get
rid
of
Blueskin
,
Baptist
turned
to
Rowland
and
Sir
Cecil
,
who
had
watched
his
proceedings
with
much
impatience
,
and
remarked
,
"
Now
,
gentlemen
,
the
coast
's
clear
;
we
've
nothing
to
interrupt
us
.
<EOS>
I
'm
entirely
at
your
service
.

<EOS>
CHAPTER
IV
.
 
<EOS>
The
Roof
and
the
Window
.
  
<EOS>
Leaving
them
to
pursue
their
conference
,
we
shall
follow
the
footsteps
of
Jonathan
,
who
,
as
the
Master
surmised
,
and
,
as
we
have
intimated
,
had
unquestionably
entered
the
house
.
<EOS>
But
at
the
beginning
of
the
affray
,
when
he
thought
every
one
was
too
much
occupied
with
his
own
concerns
to
remark
his
absence
,
he
slipped
out
of
the
room
,
not
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
the
engagement
(
for
cowardice
was
not
one
of
his
failings
)
,
but
because
he
had
another
object
in
view
.
<EOS>
Creeping
stealthily
up
stairs
,
unmasking
a
dark
lantern
,
and
glancing
into
each
room
as
he
passed
,
he
was
startled
in
one
of
them
by
the
appearance
of
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
who
seemed
to
be
crouching
upon
the
floor
.
<EOS>
Satisfied
,
however
,
that
she
did
not
notice
him
,
Jonathan
glided
away
as
noiselessly
as
he
came
,
and
ascended
another
short
flight
of
stairs
leading
to
the
garret
.
<EOS>
As
he
crossed
this
chamber
,
his
foot
struck
against
something
on
the
floor
,
which
nearly
threw
him
down
,
and
stooping
to
examine
the
object
,
he
found
it
was
a
key
.
<EOS>
"
Never
throw
away
a
chance
,
"
thought
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Who
knows
but
this
key
may
open
a
golden
lock
one
of
these
days
?
"
<EOS>
And
,
picking
it
up
,
he
thrust
it
into
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
Arrived
beneath
an
aperture
in
the
broken
roof
,
he
was
preparing
to
pass
through
it
,
when
he
observed
a
little
heap
of
tiles
upon
the
floor
,
which
appeared
to
have
been
recently
dislodged
.
"
<EOS>
He
_
has
_
passed
this
way
,
"
cried
Jonathan
,
exultingly
;
"
I
have
him
safe
enough
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
closed
the
lantern
,
mounted
without
much
difficulty
upon
the
roof
,
and
proceeded
cautiously
along
the
tiles
.
 
<EOS>
The
night
was
now
profoundly
dark
.
<EOS>
Jonathan
had
to
feel
his
way
.
<EOS>
A
single
false
step
might
have
precipitated
him
into
the
street
;
or
,
if
he
had
trodden
upon
an
unsound
part
of
the
roof
,
he
must
have
fallen
through
it
.
<EOS>
He
had
nothing
to
guide
him
;
for
though
the
torches
were
blazing
ruddily
below
,
their
gleam
fell
only
on
the
side
of
the
building
.
<EOS>
The
venturous
climber
gazed
for
a
moment
at
the
assemblage
beneath
,
to
ascertain
that
he
was
not
discovered
;
and
,
having
satisfied
himself
in
this
particular
,
he
stepped
out
more
boldly
.
<EOS>
On
gaining
a
stack
of
chimneys
at
the
back
of
the
house
,
he
came
to
a
pause
,
and
again
unmasked
his
lantern
.
<EOS>
Nothing
,
however
,
could
be
discerned
,
except
the
crumbling
brickwork
.
<EOS>
"
Confusion
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Jonathan
:
"
can
he
have
escaped
?
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
The
walls
are
too
high
,
and
the
windows
too
stoutly
barricaded
in
this
quarter
,
to
admit
such
a
supposition
.
<EOS>
He
ca
n't
be
far
off
.
<EOS>
I
shall
find
him
yet
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
have
it
,
"
he
added
,
after
a
moment
's
deliberation
;
<EOS>
"
he
's
there
,
I
'll
be
sworn
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
once
more
enveloping
himself
in
darkness
,
he
pursued
his
course
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
now
reached
the
adjoining
house
,
and
,
scaling
the
roof
,
approached
another
building
,
which
seemed
to
be
,
at
least
,
one
story
loftier
than
its
neighbours
.
<EOS>
Apparently
,
Jonathan
was
well
acquainted
with
the
premises
;
for
,
feeling
about
in
the
dark
,
he
speedily
discovered
a
ladder
,
up
the
steps
of
which
he
hurried
.
<EOS>
Drawing
a
pistol
,
and
unclosing
his
lantern
with
the
quickness
of
thought
,
he
then
burst
through
an
open
trap
-
door
into
a
small
loft
.
 
<EOS>
The
light
fell
upon
the
fugitive
,
who
stood
before
him
in
an
attitude
of
defence
,
with
the
child
in
his
arms
.
 
<EOS>
"
Aha
!
"
exclaimed
Jonathan
,
acting
upon
the
information
he
had
obtained
from
Wood
;
"
I
have
found
you
at
last
.
<EOS>
Your
servant
,
Mr.
Darrell
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Who
are
you
!
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
fugitive
,
sternly
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
friend
,
"
replied
Jonathan
,
uncocking
the
pistol
,
and
placing
it
in
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
do
I
know
you
are
a
friend
?
"
asked
Darrell
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
should
I
do
here
alone
if
I
were
an
enemy
?
<EOS>
But
,
come
,
do
n't
let
us
waste
time
in
bandying
words
,
when
we
might
employ
it
so
much
more
profitably
.
<EOS>
Your
life
,
and
that
of
your
child
,
are
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
What
will
you
give
me
to
save
you
from
your
pursuers
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
_
<EOS>
Can
_
you
do
so
?
"
asked
the
other
,
doubtfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
,
and
will
.
<EOS>
Now
,
the
reward
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
but
an
ill
-
furnished
purse
.
<EOS>
But
if
I
escape
,
my
gratitude--
"
 
"
Pshaw
!
"
<EOS>
interrupted
Jonathan
,
scornfully
.
<EOS>
"
Your
gratitude
will
vanish
with
your
danger
.
<EOS>
Pay
fools
with
promises
.
<EOS>
I
must
have
something
in
hand
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
all
I
have
about
me
,
"
replied
Darrell
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
--
well
,
"
grumbled
Jonathan
,
"
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
must
be
content
.
<EOS>
An
ill
-
lined
purse
is
a
poor
recompense
for
the
risk
I
have
run
.
<EOS>
However
,
come
along
.
<EOS>
I
need
n't
tell
you
to
tread
carefully
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
danger
of
this
breakneck
road
as
well
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
The
light
would
betray
us
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
closed
the
lantern
.
 
<EOS>
"
Harkye
,
Sir
,
"
rejoined
Darrell
;
"
one
word
before
I
move
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
who
you
are
;
and
,
as
I
can
not
discern
your
face
,
I
may
be
doing
you
an
injustice
.
<EOS>
But
there
is
something
in
your
voice
that
makes
me
distrust
you
.
<EOS>
If
you
attempt
to
play
the
traitor
,
you
will
do
so
at
the
hazard
of
your
life
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
hazarded
my
life
in
this
attempt
to
save
you
,
"
returned
Jonathan
boldly
,
and
with
apparent
frankness
;
"
this
ought
to
be
sufficient
answer
to
your
doubts
.
<EOS>
Your
pursuers
are
below
.
<EOS>
What
was
to
hinder
me
,
if
I
had
been
so
inclined
,
from
directing
them
to
your
retreat
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Enough
,
"
replied
Darrell
.
"
<EOS>
Lead
on
!
"
 
<EOS>
Followed
by
Darrell
,
Jonathan
retraced
his
dangerous
path
.
<EOS>
As
he
approached
the
gable
of
Mrs.
Sheppard
's
house
,
loud
yells
and
vociferations
reached
his
ears
;
and
,
looking
downwards
,
he
perceived
a
great
stir
amid
the
mob
.
<EOS>
The
cause
of
this
uproar
was
soon
manifest
.
<EOS>
Blueskin
and
the
Minters
were
dragging
Wood
to
the
pump
.
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
carpenter
struggled
violently
,
but
ineffectually
.
<EOS>
His
hat
was
placed
upon
one
pole
,
his
wig
on
another
.
<EOS>
His
shouts
for
help
were
answered
by
roars
of
mockery
and
laughter
.
<EOS>
He
continued
alternately
to
be
tossed
in
the
air
,
or
rolled
in
the
kennel
until
he
was
borne
out
of
sight
.
<EOS>
The
spectacle
seemed
to
afford
as
much
amusement
to
Jonathan
as
to
the
actors
engaged
in
it
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
contain
his
satisfaction
,
but
chuckled
,
and
rubbed
his
hands
with
delight
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
Heaven
!
"
cried
Darrell
,
"
it
is
the
poor
fellow
whom
I
placed
in
such
jeopardy
a
short
time
ago
.
<EOS>
I
am
the
cause
of
his
ill
-
usage
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
you
are
,
"
replied
Jonathan
,
laughing
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
what
of
that
?
<EOS>
It
'll
be
a
lesson
to
him
in
future
,
and
will
show
him
the
folly
of
doing
a
good
-
natured
action
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
perceiving
that
his
companion
did
not
relish
his
pleasantry
and
fearing
that
his
sympathy
for
the
carpenter
's
situation
might
betray
him
into
some
act
of
imprudence
,
Jonathan
,
without
further
remark
,
and
by
way
of
putting
an
end
to
the
discussion
,
let
himself
drop
through
the
roof
.
<EOS>
His
example
was
followed
by
Darrell
.
<EOS>
But
,
though
the
latter
was
somewhat
embarrassed
by
his
burthen
,
he
peremptorily
declined
Jonathan
's
offer
of
assistance
.
<EOS>
Both
,
however
,
having
safely
landed
,
they
cautiously
crossed
the
room
,
and
passed
down
the
first
flight
of
steps
in
silence
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
a
door
was
opened
below
;
lights
gleamed
on
the
walls
;
and
the
figures
of
Rowland
and
Sir
Cecil
were
distinguished
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
Darrell
stopped
,
and
drew
his
sword
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
betrayed
me
,
"
said
he
,
in
a
deep
whisper
,
to
his
companion
;
"
but
you
shall
reap
the
reward
of
your
treachery
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Be
still
!
"
<EOS>
returned
Jonathan
,
in
the
same
under
tone
,
and
with
great
self
-
possession
:
"
I
can
yet
save
you
.
<EOS>
And
see
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
as
the
figures
drew
back
,
and
the
lights
disappeared
;
"
it
's
a
false
alarm
.
<EOS>
They
have
retired
.
<EOS>
However
,
not
a
moment
is
to
be
lost
.
<EOS>
Give
me
your
hand
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
then
hurried
Darrell
down
another
short
flight
of
steps
,
and
entered
a
small
chamber
at
the
back
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Closing
the
door
,
Jonathan
next
produced
his
lantern
,
and
,
hastening
towards
the
window
,
undrew
a
bolt
by
which
it
was
fastened
.
<EOS>
A
stout
wooden
shutter
,
opening
inwardly
,
being
removed
,
disclosed
a
grating
of
iron
bars
.
<EOS>
This
obstacle
,
which
appeared
to
preclude
the
possibility
of
egress
in
that
quarter
,
was
speedily
got
rid
of
.
<EOS>
Withdrawing
another
bolt
,
and
unhooking
a
chain
suspended
from
the
top
of
the
casement
,
Jonathan
pushed
the
iron
framework
outwards
.
<EOS>
The
bars
dropped
noiselessly
and
slowly
down
,
till
the
chain
tightened
at
the
staple
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
free
,
"
said
he
,
"
that
grating
forms
a
ladder
,
by
which
you
may
descend
in
safety
.
<EOS>
I
learned
the
trick
of
the
place
from
one
Paul
Groves
,
who
used
to
live
here
,
and
who
contrived
the
machine
.
<EOS>
He
used
to
call
it
his
fire
-
escape
--
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
I
've
often
used
the
ladder
for
my
own
convenience
,
but
I
never
expected
to
turn
it
to
such
good
account
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
Sir
,
have
I
kept
faith
with
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
,
"
replied
Darrell
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
is
my
purse
;
and
I
trust
you
will
let
me
know
to
whom
I
am
indebted
for
this
important
service
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
matters
not
who
I
am
,
"
replied
Jonathan
,
taking
the
money
.
<EOS>
"
As
I
said
before
,
I
have
little
reliance
upon
_
professions
_
of
gratitude
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
how
it
is
,
"
sighed
Darrell
,
"
but
I
feel
an
unaccountable
misgiving
at
quitting
this
place
.
<EOS>
Something
tells
me
I
am
rushing
on
greater
danger
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
best
,
"
replied
Jonathan
,
sneeringly
;
"
but
if
I
were
in
your
place
<EOS>
I
would
take
the
chance
of
a
future
and
uncertain
risk
to
avoid
a
present
and
certain
peril
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
,
"
replied
Darrell
;
"
the
weakness
is
past
.
<EOS>
Which
is
the
nearest
way
to
the
river
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
it
's
an
awkward
road
to
direct
you
,
"
returned
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
if
you
turn
to
the
right
when
you
reach
the
ground
,
and
keep
close
to
the
Mint
wall
,
you
'll
speedily
arrive
at
White
Cross
Street
;
White
Cross
Street
,
if
you
turn
again
to
the
right
,
will
bring
you
into
Queen
Street
;
Queen
Street
,
bearing
to
the
left
,
will
conduct
you
to
Deadman
's
Place
;
and
Deadman
's
Place
to
the
water
-
side
,
not
fifty
yards
from
Saint
Saviour
's
stairs
,
where
you
're
sure
to
get
a
boat
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
very
point
I
aim
at
,
"
said
Darrell
as
he
passed
through
the
outlet
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stay
!
"
said
Jonathan
,
aiding
his
descent
;
"
you
had
better
take
my
lantern
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
useful
to
you
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
'll
give
me
in
return
some
token
,
by
which
I
may
remind
you
of
this
occurrence
,
in
case
we
meet
again
.
<EOS>
Your
glove
will
suffice
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
it
is
;
"
replied
the
other
,
tossing
him
the
glove
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Are
you
sure
these
bars
touch
the
ground
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
come
within
a
yard
of
it
,
"
answered
Jonathan
.
 
<EOS>
"
Safe
!
"
shouted
Darrell
,
as
he
effected
a
secure
landing
.
"
<EOS>
Good
night
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
,
"
muttered
Jonathan
,
"
having
started
the
hare
,
I
'll
now
unleash
the
hounds
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
praiseworthy
determination
,
he
was
hastening
down
stairs
,
with
the
utmost
rapidity
,
when
he
encountered
a
female
,
whom
he
took
,
in
the
darkness
,
to
be
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
The
person
caught
hold
of
his
arm
,
and
,
in
spite
of
his
efforts
to
disengage
himself
,
detained
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
is
he
?
"
<EOS>
asked
she
,
in
an
agitated
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
I
heard
his
voice
;
but
I
saw
them
on
the
stairs
,
and
durst
not
approach
him
,
for
fear
of
giving
the
alarm
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
mean
the
fugitive
,
Darrell
,
he
has
escaped
through
the
back
window
,
"
replied
Jonathan
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thank
Heaven
!
<EOS>
"
she
gasped
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
you
women
are
forgiving
creatures
,
I
must
say
,
"
observed
Jonathan
,
sarcastically
.
<EOS>
"
You
thank
Heaven
for
the
escape
of
the
man
who
did
his
best
to
get
your
child
's
neck
twisted
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
asked
the
female
,
in
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
mean
what
I
say
,
"
replied
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
do
n't
know
that
this
Darrell
so
contrived
matters
,
that
your
child
should
be
mistaken
for
his
own
;
by
which
means
it
had
a
narrow
escape
from
a
tight
cravat
,
I
can
assure
you
.
<EOS>
However
,
the
scheme
answered
well
enough
,
for
Darrell
has
got
off
with
his
own
brat
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
this
is
not
my
child
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
she
,
with
increased
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
have
a
child
there
,
it
certainly
is
not
,
"
answered
Jonathan
,
a
little
surprised
;
"
for
I
left
your
brat
in
the
charge
of
Blueskin
,
who
is
still
among
the
crowd
in
the
street
,
unless
,
as
is
not
unlikely
,
he
's
gone
to
see
your
other
friend
disciplined
at
the
pump
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Merciful
providence
!
"
exclaimed
the
female
.
<EOS>
"
Whose
child
can
this
be
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
the
devil
should
I
know
!
"
replied
Jonathan
gruffly
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
did
n't
drop
through
the
ceiling
,
did
it
?
<EOS>
Are
you
quite
sure
it
's
flesh
and
blood
?
"
<EOS>
asked
he
,
playfully
pinching
its
arm
till
it
cried
out
with
pain
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
child
!
<EOS>
my
child
!
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
rushing
from
the
adjoining
room
.
<EOS>
"
Where
is
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
the
mother
of
this
child
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
person
who
had
first
spoken
,
addressing
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
--
I
am
!
"
cried
the
widow
,
snatching
the
babe
,
and
pressing
it
to
her
breast
with
rapturous
delight
<EOS>
"
God
be
thanked
,
I
have
found
it
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
both
good
reason
to
be
grateful
,
"
added
the
lady
,
with
great
emotion
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Sblood
!
"
cried
Jonathan
,
who
had
listened
to
the
foregoing
conversation
with
angry
wonder
,
"
I
've
been
nicely
done
here
.
<EOS>
Fool
that
I
was
to
part
with
my
lantern
!
<EOS>
But
I
'll
soon
set
myself
straight
.
<EOS>
What
ho
!
<EOS>
lights
!
<EOS>
lights
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
shouting
as
he
went
,
he
flung
himself
down
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
shall
I
fly
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
lady
,
bewildered
with
terror
.
<EOS>
"
They
will
kill
me
,
if
they
find
me
,
as
they
would
have
killed
my
husband
and
child
.
<EOS>
Oh
God
!
<EOS>
my
limbs
fail
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Make
an
effort
,
Madam
,
"
cried
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
as
a
storm
of
furious
voices
resounded
from
below
,
and
torches
were
seen
mounting
the
stairs
;
"
they
are
coming!--they
are
coming!--fly!--to
the
roof
!
<EOS>
to
the
roof
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
cried
the
lady
,
"
this
room
<EOS>
--
I
recollect
--
<EOS>
it
has
a
back
window
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
shut
,
"
said
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
open
,
"
replied
the
lady
,
rushing
towards
it
,
and
springing
through
the
outlet
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
is
she
?
<EOS>
"
thundered
Jonathan
,
who
at
this
moment
reached
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
has
flown
up
stairs
,
"
replied
the
widow
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
lie
,
hussy
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Jonathan
,
rudely
pushing
her
aside
,
as
she
vainly
endeavoured
to
oppose
his
entrance
into
the
room
;
"
she
is
here
.
<EOS>
Hist
!
"
<EOS>
cried
he
,
as
a
scream
was
heard
from
without
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
By
G--
!
<EOS>
she
has
missed
her
footing
.
"
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
momentary
and
terrible
silence
,
broken
only
by
a
few
feeble
groans
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Cecil
,
who
with
Rowland
and
some
others
had
entered
the
room
rushed
to
the
window
with
a
torch
.
 
<EOS>
He
held
down
the
light
,
and
a
moment
afterwards
beckoned
,
with
a
blanched
cheek
,
to
Rowland
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
sister
is
dead
,
"
said
he
,
in
a
deep
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
"
Her
blood
be
upon
her
own
head
,
then
,
"
replied
Rowland
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
Why
came
she
here
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
could
not
resist
the
hand
of
fate
which
drew
her
hither
,
"
replied
Sir
Cecil
,
mournfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
Descend
and
take
charge
of
the
body
,
"
said
Rowland
,
conquering
his
emotion
by
a
great
effort
,
"
I
will
join
you
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
This
accident
rather
confirms
than
checks
my
purpose
.
<EOS>
The
stain
upon
our
family
is
only
half
effaced
:
I
have
sworn
the
death
of
the
villain
and
his
bastard
,
and
I
will
keep
my
oath
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Sir
,
"
he
added
,
turning
to
Jonathan
,
as
Sir
Cecil
and
his
followers
obeyed
his
injunctions
,
"
you
say
you
know
the
road
which
the
person
whom
we
seek
has
taken
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
replied
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
give
no
information
gratis
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Speak
,
then
,
"
said
Rowland
,
placing
money
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
'll
find
him
at
St.
Saviours
's
stairs
,
"
answered
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
about
to
cross
the
river
.
<EOS>
You
'd
better
lose
no
time
.
<EOS>
He
has
got
five
minutes
'
start
of
you
.
<EOS>
But
I
sent
him
the
longest
way
about
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
words
were
scarcely
pronounced
,
when
Rowland
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
now
to
see
the
end
of
it
,
"
said
Jonathan
,
shortly
afterwards
passing
through
the
window
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
night
,
Master
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Three
persons
only
were
left
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
These
were
the
Master
of
the
Mint
,
Van
Galgebrok
,
and
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
bad
business
<EOS>
this
,
Van
,
"
observed
Baptist
,
with
a
prolonged
shake
of
the
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ja
,
ja
,
Muntmeester
,
"
said
the
Hollander
,
shaking
his
head
in
reply;--"very
bad
--
very
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
then
they
're
staunch
supporters
of
our
friend
over
the
water
,
"
continued
Baptist
,
winking
significantly
;
"
<EOS>
so
we
must
e'en
hush
it
up
in
the
best
way
we
can
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ja
,
"
answered
Van
Galgebrok
.
"
<EOS>
But
--
sapperment!--I
wish
they
had
n't
broken
my
pipe
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
JONATHAN
WILD
promises
well
,
"
observed
the
Master
,
after
a
pause
:
"
he
'll
become
a
great
man
.
<EOS>
Mind
,
I
,
Baptist
Kettleby
,
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
'll
be
hanged
nevertheless
,
"
replied
the
Hollander
,
giving
his
collar
an
ugly
jerk
.
<EOS>
"
Mind
,
I
,
Rykhart
Van
Galgebrok
predict
it
.
<EOS>
And
now
let
's
go
back
to
the
Shovels
,
and
finish
our
brandewyn
and
bier
,
Muntmeester
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
"
cried
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
relieved
by
their
departure
,
and
giving
way
to
a
passionate
flood
of
tears
;
"
were
it
not
for
my
child
,
I
should
wish
to
be
in
the
place
of
that
unfortunate
lady
.

CHAPTER
V.
 
<EOS>
The
Denunciation
.
  
<EOS>
For
a
short
space
,
Mrs.
Sheppard
remained
dissolved
in
tears
.
<EOS>
She
then
dried
her
eyes
,
and
laying
her
child
gently
upon
the
floor
,
knelt
down
beside
him
.
"
<EOS>
Open
my
heart
,
Father
of
Mercy
!
"
<EOS>
she
murmured
,
in
a
humble
tone
,
and
with
downcast
looks
,
"
and
make
me
sensible
of
the
error
of
my
ways
.
<EOS>
I
have
sinned
deeply
;
but
I
have
been
sorely
tried
.
<EOS>
Spare
me
yet
a
little
while
,
Father
!
<EOS>
not
for
my
own
sake
,
but
for
the
sake
of
this
poor
babe
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
utterance
was
here
choked
by
sobs
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
it
is
thy
will
to
take
me
from
him
,
"
she
continued
,
as
soon
as
her
emotion
permitted
her,--"if
he
must
be
left
an
orphan
amid
strangers
,
implant
,
<EOS>
I
beseech
thee
,
a
mother
's
feelings
in
some
other
bosom
,
and
raise
up
a
friend
,
who
shall
be
to
him
what
I
would
have
been
.
<EOS>
Let
him
not
bear
the
weight
of
my
punishment
.
<EOS>
Spare
him!--pity
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
she
arose
,
and
,
taking
up
the
infant
<EOS>
,
was
about
to
proceed
down
stairs
,
when
she
was
alarmed
by
hearing
the
street
-
door
opened
,
and
the
sound
of
heavy
footsteps
entering
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
"
Halloa
,
widow
!
<EOS>
"
shouted
a
rough
voice
from
below
,
"
where
the
devil
are
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Sheppard
returned
no
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
got
something
to
say
to
you
,
"
continued
the
speaker
,
rather
less
harshly
;
"
something
to
your
advantage
;
so
come
out
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
your
hiding
-
place
,
and
let
's
have
some
supper
,
for
I
'm
infernally
hungry.--D'ye
hear
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Still
the
widow
remained
silent
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
if
you
wo
n't
come
,
I
shall
help
myself
,
and
that
's
unsociable
,
"
pursued
the
speaker
,
evidently
,
from
the
noise
he
made
,
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Devilish
nice
ham
<EOS>
you
've
got
here!--capital
pie!--and
,
as
I
live
,
a
flask
of
excellent
canary
.
<EOS>
You
're
in
luck
to
-
night
,
widow
.
<EOS>
Here
's
your
health
in
a
bumper
,
and
wishing
you
a
better
husband
than
your
first
.
<EOS>
It
'll
be
your
own
fault
if
you
do
n't
soon
get
another
and
a
proper
young
man
into
the
bargain
.
<EOS>
Here
's
his
health
likewise
.
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
mum
still
.
<EOS>
You
're
the
first
widow
I
ever
heard
of
who
could
withstand
that
lure
.
<EOS>
I
'll
try
the
effect
of
a
jolly
stave

<EOS>
And
he
struck
up
the
following
ballad:--

He
was

left

smiled

Crying

growled
the

,
as
he
brought
his
ditty
to
a
close
;
"
will
nothing

<EOS>

added

rising
,

<EOS>
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
whose
distress
at
the
consumption
of
the
provisions
had
been
somewhat
allayed
by
the
anticipation
of
the
intruder
's
departure
after
he
had
satisfied
his
appetite
,
was
now
terrified
in
the
extreme
by
seeing
a
light
approach
,
and
hearing
footsteps
on
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
Her
first
impulse
was
to
fly
to
the
window
;
and
she
was
about
to
pass
through
it
,
at
the
risk
of
sharing
the
fate
of
the
unfortunate
lady
,
when
her
arm
was
grasped
by
some
one
in
the
act
of
ascending
the
ladder
from
without
.
<EOS>
Uttering
a
faint
scream
,
she
sank
backwards
,
and
would
have
fallen
,
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
interposition
of
Blueskin
,
who
,
at
that
moment
,
staggered
into
the
room
with
a
candle
in
one
hand
,
and
the
bottle
in
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
're
here
,
are
you
?
"
said
the
ruffian
,
with
an
exulting
laugh
:
<EOS>
"
I
've
been
looking
for
you
everywhere
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
go
,
"
implored
<EOS>
Mrs.
Sheppard,--"pray
<EOS>
let
me
go
.
<EOS>
You
hurt
the
child
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
hear
how
you
've
made
it
cry
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Throttle
the
kid
!
"
rejoined
Blueskin
,
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
n't
stop
its
squalling
,
I
will
.
<EOS>
I
hate
children
.
<EOS>
And
,
if
I
'd
my
own
way
,
I
'd
drown
'em
all
like
a
litter
o
'
puppies
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Well
knowing
the
savage
temper
of
the
person
she
had
to
deal
with
,
and
how
likely
he
was
to
put
his
threat
into
execution
,
Mrs.
Sheppard
did
not
dare
to
return
any
answer
;
but
,
disengaging
herself
from
his
embrace
,
endeavoured
meekly
to
comply
with
his
request
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
widow
,
"
continued
the
ruffian
,
setting
down
the
candle
,
and
applying
his
lips
to
the
bottle
neck
as
he
flung
his
heavy
frame
upon
a
bench
,
"
I
've
a
piece
o
'
good
news
for
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Good
news
will
be
news
to
me
.
<EOS>
What
is
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Guess
,
"
rejoined
Blueskin
,
attempting
to
throw
a
gallant
expression
into
his
forbidding
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Sheppard
trembled
violently
;
and
though
she
understood
his
meaning
too
well
,
she
answered,--"I
ca
n't
guess
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
"
returned
the
ruffian
,
"
to
put
you
out
o
'
suspense
,
as
the
topsman
remarked
to
poor
Tom
Sheppard
,
afore
<EOS>
he
turned
him
off
,
I
'm
come
to
make
you
an
honourable
proposal
o
'
marriage
.
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
refuse
me
,
I
'm
sure
;
so
no
more
need
be
said
about
the
matter
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
,
we
'll
go
to
the
Fleet
and
get
spliced
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
shake
so
.
<EOS>
What
I
said
about
your
brat
was
all
stuff
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
mean
it
.
<EOS>
It
's
my
way
when
I
'm
ruffled
.
<EOS>
I
shall
take
to
him
as
nat'ral
as
if
he
were
my
own
flesh
and
<EOS>
blood
afore
<EOS>
long.--I'll
give
him
the
edication
of
a
prig,--teach
him
<EOS>
the
use
of
his
forks
betimes,--and
make
him
,
in
the
end
,
as
clever
a
cracksman
as
his
father
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
!
"
shrieked
Mrs.
Sheppard
;
"
never
!
<EOS>
never
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Halloa
!
<EOS>
what
's
this
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Blueskin
,
springing
to
his
feet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
mean
to
say
that
if
I
support
your
kid
,
I
sha
n't
bring
him
up
how
I
please
--
eh
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
question
me
,
but
leave
me
,
"
replied
the
widow
wildly
;
"
you
had
better
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Leave
you
!
"
echoed
the
ruffian
,
with
a
contemptuous
laugh
;
"
--not
just
yet
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
unprotected
,
"
rejoined
the
poor
woman
;
"
there
's
some
one
at
the
window
.
<EOS>
Help
!
<EOS>
help
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
her
cries
were
unheeded
.
<EOS>
And
Blueskin
,
who
,
for
a
moment
,
had
looked
round
distrustfully
,
concluding
it
was
a
feint
,
now
laughed
louder
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
wo
n't
do
,
widow
,
"
said
he
,
drawing
near
her
,
while
she
shrank
from
his
approach
,
"
<EOS>
so
you
may
spare
your
breath
.
<EOS>
Come
,
come
,
be
reasonable
,
and
listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
Your
kid
has
already
brought
me
good
luck
,
and
may
bring
me
still
more
if
his
edication
's
attended
to
.
<EOS>
This
purse
,
"
he
added
,
chinking
it
in
the
air
,
"
and
this
ring
,
were
given
me
for
him
just
now
by
the
lady
,
who
made
a
false
step
on
leaving
your
house
.
<EOS>
If
I
'd
been
in
the
way
,
instead
of
Jonathan
Wild
,
that
accident
would
n't
have
happened
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
said
this
,
a
slight
noise
was
heard
without
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
?
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
the
ruffian
,
glancing
uneasily
towards
the
window
.
<EOS>
"
Who
's
there?--Pshaw
!
<EOS>
it
's
only
the
wind
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
Jonathan
Wild
,
"
<EOS>
returned
the
widow
,
endeavouring
to
alarm
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
I
was
not
unprotected
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
_
<EOS>
He
_
protect
_
you
_
,
<EOS>
"
retorted
Blueskin
,
maliciously
;
"
you
have
n't
a
worse
enemy
on
the
face
of
the
earth
than
Jonathan
Wild
.
<EOS>
If
you
'd
read
your
husband
's
dying
speech
,
you
'd
know
that
he
laid
his
death
at
Jonathan
's
door,--and
with
reason
too
,
as
I
can
testify
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Man
!
"
screamed
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
with
a
vehemence
that
shook
even
the
hardened
wretch
beside
her
,
"
begone
,
and
tempt
me
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
should
I
tempt
you
to
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Blueskin
,
in
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
--
to
--
<EOS>
no
matter
what
,
"
returned
the
widow
distractedly
.
<EOS>
"
Go
--
go
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
what
you
mean
,
"
rejoined
Blueskin
,
tossing
a
large
case
-
knife
,
which
he
took
from
his
pocket
,
in
the
air
,
and
catching
it
dexterously
by
the
haft
as
it
fell
;
"
you
owe
Jonathan
a
grudge;--so
<EOS>
do
<EOS>
I.
He
hanged
your
first
husband
.
<EOS>
Just
speak
the
word
,
"
he
added
,
drawing
the
knife
significantly
across
his
throat
,
"
and
I
'll
put
it
out
of
his
power
to
do
the
same
by
your
second
.
<EOS>
But
d
--
<EOS>
n
him
!
<EOS>
let
's
talk
<EOS>
o
'
something
more
agreeable
.
<EOS>
Look
at
this
ring;--it
's
a
diamond
,
and
worth
a
mint
o
'
money
.
<EOS>
It
shall
be
your
wedding
ring
.
<EOS>
Look
at
it
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
The
lady
's
name
's
engraved
inside
,
but
so
small
I
can
scarcely
read
it
.

A

Aliva

<EOS>
Trencher
that
's
it
.
<EOS>
Aliva
Trencher
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Aliva
Trenchard
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
hastily
;
"
is
that
the
name
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
now
I
look
again
<EOS>
it
_
is
_
Trenchard
.
<EOS>
How
came
you
to
know
it
?
<EOS>
Have
you
heard
the
name
before
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
have
--
long
,
long
ago
,
when
I
was
a
child
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
passing
her
hand
across
her
brow
;
"
but
my
memory
is
gone
--
<EOS>
quite
gone
.
<EOS>
Where
_
can
_
<EOS>
I
have
heard
it
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Devil
knows
,
"
rejoined
Blueskin
.
"
<EOS>
Let
it
pass
.
<EOS>
The
ring
's
yours
,
and
you
're
mine
.
<EOS>
Here
,
put
it
on
your
finger
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Sheppard
snatched
back
her
hand
from
his
grasp
,
and
exerted
all
her
force
to
repel
his
advances
.
 
<EOS>
"
Set
down
the
kid
,
"
roared
Blueskin
,
savagely
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mercy
!
"
screamed
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
struggling
to
escape
,
and
holding
the
infant
at
arm
's
length
;
"
have
mercy
on
this
helpless
innocent
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
the
child
,
alarmed
by
the
strife
,
added
its
feeble
cries
to
its
mother
's
shrieks
.
 
<EOS>
"
Set
it
down
,
I
tell
you
,
"
thundered
Blueskin
,
"
or
I
shall
do
it
a
mischief
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
!
"
cried
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
 
<EOS>
Uttering
a
terrible
imprecation
,
Blueskin
placed
the
knife
between
his
teeth
,
and
endeavoured
to
seize
the
poor
woman
by
the
throat
.
<EOS>
In
the
struggle
her
cap
fell
off
.
<EOS>
The
ruffian
caught
hold
of
her
hair
,
and
held
her
fast
.
<EOS>
The
chamber
rang
with
her
shrieks
.
<EOS>
But
her
cries
,
instead
of
moving
her
assailant
's
compassion
,
only
added
to
his
fury
.
<EOS>
Planting
his
knee
against
her
side
,
he
pulled
her
towards
him
with
one
hand
,
while
with
the
other
he
sought
his
knife
.
<EOS>
The
child
was
now
within
reach
;
and
,
in
another
moment
,
he
would
have
executed
his
deadly
purpose
,
if
an
arm
from
behind
had
not
felled
him
to
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
When
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
who
had
been
stricken
down
by
the
blow
that
prostrated
her
assailant
,
looked
up
,
she
perceived
Jonathan
Wild
kneeling
beside
the
body
of
Blueskin
.
<EOS>
He
was
holding
the
ring
to
the
light
,
and
narrowly
examining
the
inscription
.
 
<EOS>
"
Trenchard
,
"
he
muttered
;
"
Aliva
Trenchard
--
they
were
right
,
then
,
as
to
the
name
.
<EOS>
Well
,
if
she
survives
the
accident
--
as
the
blood
,
who
styles
himself
Sir
Cecil
,
fancies
she
may
do
--
this
ring
will
make
my
fortune
by
leading
to
the
discovery
of
the
chief
parties
concerned
in
this
strange
affair
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Is
the
poor
lady
alive
?
"
asked
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Sblood
!
"
exclaimed
Jonathan
,
hastily
thrusting
the
ring
into
his
vest
,
and
taking
up
a
heavy
horseman
's
pistol
with
which
he
had
felled
<EOS>
Blueskin,--"I
thought
you
'd
been
senseless
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Is
she
alive
?
"
repeated
the
widow
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
to
you
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Jonathan
,
gruffly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
nothing
--
nothing
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
"
<EOS>
But
pray
tell
me
if
her
husband
has
escaped
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Her
husband
!
"
echoed
Jonathan
scornfully
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
_
husband
_
has
little
to
fear
from
his
wife
's
kinsfolk
.
<EOS>
Her
_
lover
_
,
Darrell
,
has
embarked
upon
the
Thames
,
where
,
if
he
's
not
capsized
by
the
squall
,
(
for
it
's
blowing
like
the
devil
,
)
<EOS>
he
stands
a
good
chance
of
getting
his
throat
cut
by
his
pursuers
--
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
I
tracked
'em
to
the
banks
of
the
river
,
and
should
have
followed
to
see
it
out
,
if
the
watermen
had
n't
refused
to
take
me
.
<EOS>
However
,
as
things
have
turned
up
,
it
's
fortunate
that
I
came
back
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
indeed
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Sheppard
;
"
most
fortunate
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
For
_
you
_
!
"
exclaimed
Jonathan
;
"
do
n't
flatter
yourself
that
I
'm
thinking
of
you
.
<EOS>
Blueskin
might
have
butchered
you
and
your
brat
before
I
'd
have
lifted
a
finger
to
prevent
him
,
if
it
had
n't
suited
my
purposes
to
do
so
,
and
_
he
_
had
n't
incurred
my
displeasure
.
<EOS>
I
never
forgive
an
injury
.
<EOS>
Your
husband
could
have
told
you
that
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
had
he
offended
you
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
widow
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
,
"
answered
Jonathan
,
sternly
.
"
<EOS>
He
thwarted
my
schemes
twice
.
<EOS>
The
first
time
,
I
overlooked
the
offence
;
but
the
second
time
,
when
I
had
planned
to
break
open
the
house
of
his
master
,
the
fellow
who
visited
you
to
-
night,--Wood
,
the
carpenter
of
Wych
Street,--he
betrayed
me
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
I
would
bring
him
to
the
gallows
,
and
I
was
as
good
as
my
word
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
were
so
,
"
replied
Mrs
Sheppard
;
"
and
for
that
wicked
deed
you
will
one
day
be
brought
to
the
gallows
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
before
I
have
conducted
your
child
thither
,
"
retorted
Jonathan
,
with
a
withering
look
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
ejaculated
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
paralysed
by
the
threat
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
that
sickly
brat
lives
to
be
a
man
,
"
continued
Jonathan
,
rising
,
"
I
'll
hang
him
upon
the
same
tree
as
his
father
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pity
!
"
shrieked
the
widow
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
be
his
evil
genius
!
"
<EOS>
vociferated
Jonathan
,
who
seemed
to
enjoy
her
torture
.
 
<EOS>
"
Begone
,
wretch
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
mother
,
stung
beyond
endurance
by
his
taunts
;
"
or
I
will
drive
you
hence
with
my
curses
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Curse
on
,
and
welcome
,
"
jeered
Wild
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Sheppard
raised
her
hand
,
and
the
malediction
trembled
upon
her
tongue
.
<EOS>
But
ere
the
words
could
find
utterance
,
her
maternal
tenderness
overcame
her
indignation
;
and
,
sinking
upon
her
knees
,
she
extended
her
arms
over
her
child
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
mother
's
prayers
--
a
mother
's
blessings
,
"
she
cried
,
with
the
fervour
almost
of
inspiration
,
"
will
avail
against
a
fiend
's
malice
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
see
,
"
rejoined
Jonathan
,
turning
carelessly
upon
his
heel
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
as
he
quitted
the
room
,
the
poor
widow
fell
with
her
face
upon
the
floor
.

CHAPTER
VI
.
 
<EOS>
The
Storm
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
was
liberated
by
his
persecutors
,
Mr.
Wood
set
off
at
full
speed
from
the
Mint
,
and
,
hurrying
he
scarce
knew
whither
(
for
there
was
such
a
continual
buzzing
in
his
ears
and
dancing
in
his
eyes
,
as
almost
to
take
away
the
power
of
reflection
)
,
he
held
on
at
a
brisk
pace
till
his
strength
completely
failed
him
.
 
<EOS>
On
regaining
his
breath
,
he
began
to
consider
whither
chance
had
led
him
;
and
,
rubbing
his
eyes
to
clear
his
sight
,
he
perceived
a
sombre
pile
,
with
a
lofty
tower
and
broad
roof
,
immediately
in
front
of
him
.
<EOS>
This
structure
at
once
satisfied
him
as
to
where
he
stood
.
<EOS>
He
knew
it
to
be
St.
Saviour
's
Church
.
<EOS>
As
he
looked
up
at
the
massive
tower
,
the
clock
tolled
forth
the
hour
of
midnight
.
<EOS>
The
solemn
strokes
were
immediately
answered
by
a
multitude
of
chimes
,
sounding
across
the
Thames
,
amongst
which
the
deep
note
of
Saint
Paul
's
was
plainly
distinguishable
.
<EOS>
A
feeling
of
inexplicable
awe
crept
over
the
carpenter
as
the
sounds
died
away
.
<EOS>
He
trembled
,
not
from
any
superstitious
dread
,
but
from
an
undefined
sense
of
approaching
danger
.
<EOS>
The
peculiar
appearance
of
the
sky
was
not
without
some
influence
in
awakening
these
terrors
.
<EOS>
Over
one
of
the
pinnacles
of
the
tower
a
speck
of
pallid
light
marked
the
position
of
the
moon
,
then
newly
born
and
newly
risen
.
<EOS>
It
was
still
profoundly
dark
;
but
the
wind
,
which
had
begun
to
blow
with
some
violence
,
chased
the
clouds
rapidly
across
the
heavens
,
and
dispersed
the
vapours
hanging
nearer
the
earth
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
the
moon
was
totally
eclipsed
;
at
others
,
it
shed
a
wan
and
ghastly
glimmer
over
the
masses
rolling
in
the
firmament
.
<EOS>
Not
a
star
could
be
discerned
,
but
,
in
their
stead
,
streaks
of
lurid
radiance
,
whence
proceeding
it
was
impossible
to
determine
,
shot
ever
and
anon
athwart
the
dusky
vault
,
and
added
to
the
ominous
and
threatening
appearance
of
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
Alarmed
by
these
prognostications
of
a
storm
,
and
feeling
too
much
exhausted
from
his
late
severe
treatment
to
proceed
further
on
foot
,
Wood
endeavoured
to
find
a
tavern
where
he
might
warm
and
otherwise
refresh
himself
.
<EOS>
With
this
view
he
struck
off
into
a
narrow
street
on
the
left
,
and
soon
entered
a
small
alehouse
,
over
the
door
of
which
hung
the
sign
of
the
"
Welsh
Trumpeter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
have
a
glass
of
brandy
,
"
said
he
,
addressing
the
host
.
 
<EOS>
"
Too
late
,
master
,
"
replied
the
landlord
of
the
Trumpeter
,
in
a
surly
tone
,
for
he
did
not
much
like
the
appearance
of
his
customer
;
"
just
shut
up
shop
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Zounds
!
<EOS>
David
Pugh
,
do
n't
you
know
your
old
friend
and
countryman
?
"
exclaimed
the
carpenter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
Owen
Wood
,
is
it
you
?
"
cried
David
in
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"
What
the
devil
makes
you
out
so
late
?
<EOS>
And
what
has
happened
to
you
,
man
<EOS>
,
eh?--you
seem
in
a
queer
plight
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Give
me
the
brandy
,
and
I
'll
tell
you
,
"
replied
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
,
wife
--
hostess
--
fetch
me
that
bottle
from
the
second
shelf
in
the
corner
<EOS>
cupboard.--There
,
Mr.
Wood
<EOS>
,
"
cried
David
,
pouring
out
a
glass
of
the
spirit
,
and
offering
it
to
the
carpenter
,
"
that
'll
warm
the
cockles
of
your
heart
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
afraid
,
man,--off
with
it
.
<EOS>
It
's
right
Nantz
.
<EOS>
I
keep
it
for
my
own
drinking
,
"
he
added
in
a
lower
tone
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Wood
having
disposed
of
the
brandy
,
and
pronounced
himself
much
better
,
hurried
close
to
the
fire
-
side
,
and
informed
his
friend
in
a
few
words
of
the
inhospitable
treatment
he
had
experienced
from
the
gentlemen
of
the
Mint
;
whereupon
Mr.
Pugh
,
who
,
as
well
as
the
carpenter
,
was
a
descendant
of
Cadwallader
,
waxed
extremely
wrath
;
gave
utterance
to
a
number
of
fierce
-
sounding
imprecations
in
the
Welsh
tongue
;
and
was
just
beginning
to
express
the
greatest
anxiety
to
catch
some
of
the
rascals
at
the
Trumpeter
,
when
Mr.
Wood
cut
him
short
by
stating
his
intention
of
crossing
the
river
as
soon
as
possible
in
order
to
avoid
the
storm
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
storm
!
"
exclaimed
the
landlord
.
"
<EOS>
Gadzooks
!
<EOS>
I
thought
something
was
coming
on
;
for
when
I
looked
at
the
weather
-
glass
an
hour
ago
,
it
had
sunk
lower
than
I
ever
remember
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
have
a
durty
night
on
it
,
to
a
sartinty
,
landlord
,
"
observed
an
old
one
-
eyed
sailor
,
who
sat
smoking
his
pipe
by
the
fire
-
side
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
glass
never
sinks
in
that
way
,
d'ye
see
,
without
a
hurricane
follerin
'
,
I
've
knowed
it
often
do
so
in
the
West
Injees
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
a
souple
o
'
porpusses
came
up
with
the
tide
this
mornin
'
,
and
ha
'
bin
flounderin
'
about
i
'
the
Thames

Lunnun
Bridge
all
day
long
;
and
them
say
-
monsters
,
you
know
,
always
proves
sure
fore
runners
of
a
gale
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
the
sooner
I
'm
off
the
better
,
"
cried
Wood
;
"
what
's
to
pay
,
David
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
affront
me
,
Owen
,
by
asking
such
a
question
,
"
returned
the
landlord
;
"
had
n't
you
better
stop
and
finish
the
bottle
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
a
drop
more
,
"
replied
Wood
.

Good

"
Well

if
you

Owen

"
observed
the
landlord
,
"
there
's
a
waterman
asleep
on
that
bench
will
help
you
to
as
tidy
a
craft

<EOS>
Halloa
,
Ben
!
"
<EOS>
cried
he
,
shaking
a
broad
-
backed
fellow
,
equipped
in
a
short
-
skirted
doublet
,
and
having
a
badge
upon
his
arm,--"scullers

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Holloa

my

!

cried
Ben
,
starting
to
his
feet
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
gentleman
wants
a
pair
of
oars
,
"
said
the
landlord
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
to

master

"
asked
Ben
,
touching
his
woollen
cap
.
 
<EOS>
"
Arundel
Stairs
,
"
replied
Wood
,
"
the
nearest
point
to
Wych
Street

"
 
<EOS>
"
Come
along
,
master
,
"
said
the
waterman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hark
'
ee
,
Ben
,
"
said
the
old
sailor
,
knocking
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
upon
the
hob
;
"
you
may
try

but
dash
my
timbers

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
why
not
,
old

"
<EOS>
inquired
Ben
,
turning
a
quid
in
his
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
"
'Cos
there

a

replied
the
tar

<EOS>
"
It

sharp

,

I
shall
give

the
slip

"
laughed
Ben
:
"
the
gale
never
yet
blowed
as
could
perwent
my

Thames

<EOS>
The

I

never

"
 
<EOS>
"
May

"
replied
the
old

drily
;
"
<EOS>

you
'll

<EOS>

I
tell

gravely
;

pay

There
's

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
tell

what

"
observed
the
old
sailor
,
quietly
replenishing
his
pipe
from
a
huge
pewter
tobacco
-
box
,
as
the
waterman
and
Wood
quitted
the
house
,
"
you
've
said
good

b'ye
to

friend

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Odd
's
me

<EOS>
do
you
think
so

<EOS>
"
cried
the
host
of
the
Trumpeter
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
run
and
bring
him
back
.
<EOS>
He
's
a
Welshman
,
and
I
would
n't
for
a
trifle
that
any
accident
befel
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
,
"
said
the
old
sailor
,
taking
up
a
piece
of
blazing
coal
with
the
tongs
,
and
applying
it
to
his
pipe
;
"
let
'em
try
.
<EOS>
They
'll
be
back
soon
enough
--
or
not
at
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Wood
and
the
waterman
,
meanwhile
,
proceeded
in
the
direction
of
St.
Saviour
's
Stairs
.
<EOS>
Casting
a
hasty
glance
at
the
old
and
ruinous
prison
belonging
to
the
liberty
of
the
Bishop
of
Winchester
(
whose
palace
formerly
adjoined
the
river
)
,
called
the
Clink
,
which
gave
its
name
to
the
street
,
along
which
he
walked
:
and
noticing
,
with
some
uneasiness
,
the
melancholy
manner
in
which
the
wind
whistled
through
its
barred
casements
,
the
carpenter
followed
his
companion
down
an
opening
to
the
right
,
and
presently
arrived
at
the
water
-
side
.
 
<EOS>
Moored
to
the
steps
,
several
wherries
were
dancing
in
the
rushing
current
,
as
if
impatient
of
restraint
.
<EOS>
Into
one
of
these
the
waterman
jumped
,
and
,
having
assisted
Mr.
Wood
to
a
seat
within
it
,
immediately
pushed
from
land
.
<EOS>
Ben
had
scarcely
adjusted
his
oars
,
when
the
gleam
of
a
lantern
was
seen
moving
towards
the
bank
.
<EOS>
A
shout
was
heard
at
a
little
distance
,
and
,
the
next
moment
,
a
person
rushed
with
breathless
haste
to
the
stair
-
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
Boat
there
!
"
<EOS>
cried
a
voice
,
which
Mr.
Wood
fancied
he
recognised
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
'll
find
a
waterman
asleep
under
his
tilt
in
one
of
them
ere
craft
,
if
you
look
about
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Ben
,
backing
water
as
he
spoke
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ca
n't
you
take
me
with
you
?
"
urged
the
voice
;
"
I
'll
make
it
well
worth
your
while
.
<EOS>
I
've
a
child
here
whom
I
wish
to
convey
across
the
water
without
loss
of
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
child
!
"
<EOS>
thought
Wood
;
it
must
be
the
fugitive
Darrell
.
"
<EOS>
Hold
hard
,
"
cried
he
,
addressing
the
waterman
;
"
I
'll
give
the
gentleman
a
lift
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Unpossible
,
master
,
"
rejoined
Ben
;
"
the
tide
's
running
down
like
a
mill
-
sluice
,
and
the
wind
's
right
in
our
teeth
.
<EOS>
Old
saltwater
was
right
.
<EOS>
We
shall
have
a
reg'lar
squall
afore
we
gets
across
.
<EOS>
D'ye
hear
how
the
wanes
creaks
on
old
Winchester
House
?
<EOS>
We
shall
have
a
touch
on
it
ourselves
presently
.
<EOS>
But
I
shall
lose
my
wager
if
I
stay
a
moment
longer
--
so
here
goes
.
<EOS>
"
Upon
which
,
he
plunged
his
oars
deeply
into
the
stream
,
and
the
bark
shot
from
the
strand
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Wood
's
anxiety
respecting
the
fugitive
was
speedily
relieved
by
hearing
another
waterman
busy
himself
in
preparation
for
starting
;
and
,
shortly
after
,
the
dip
of
a
second
pair
of
oars
sounded
upon
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
"
Curse
me
,
if
I
do
n't
think
all
the
world
means
to
cross
the
Thames
this
fine
night
,
"
observed
Ben
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
One'd
think
it
rained
fares
,
as
well
as
blowed
great
guns
.
<EOS>
Why
,
there
's
another
party
on
the
stair
-
head
inquiring
arter
scullers
;
and
,
by
the
mass
!
<EOS>
they
appear
in
a
greater
hurry
than
any
on
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
His
attention
being
thus
drawn
to
the
bank
,
the
carpenter
beheld
three
figures
,
one
of
whom
bore
a
torch
,
leap
into
a
wherry
of
a
larger
size
than
the
others
,
which
immediately
put
off
from
shore
.
<EOS>
Manned
by
a
couple
of
watermen
,
who
rowed
with
great
swiftness
,
this
wherry
dashed
through
the
current
in
the
track
of
the
fugitive
,
of
whom
it
was
evidently
in
pursuit
,
and
upon
whom
it
perceptibly
gained
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wood
strained
his
eyes
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
flying
skiff
.
<EOS>
But
he
could
only
discern
a
black
and
shapeless
mass
,
floating
upon
the
water
at
a
little
distance
,
which
,
to
his
bewildered
fancy
,
appeared
absolutely
standing
still
.
<EOS>
To
the
practised
eye
of
the
waterman
matters
wore
a
very
different
air
.
<EOS>
He
perceived
clearly
enough
,
that
the
chase
was
moving
quickly
;
and
he
was
also
aware
,
from
the
increased
rapidity
with
which
the
oars
were
urged
,
that
every
exertion
was
made
on
board
to
get
out
of
the
reach
of
her
pursuers
.
<EOS>
At
one
moment
,
it
seemed
as
if
the
flying
bark
was
about
to
put
to
shore
.
<EOS>
But
this
plan
(
probably
from
its
danger
)
was
instantly
abandoned
;
not
,
however
,
before
her
momentary
hesitation
had
been
taken
advantage
of
by
her
pursuers
,
who
,
redoubling
their
efforts
at
this
juncture
,
materially
lessened
the
distance
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
Ben
watched
these
manoeuvres
with
great
interest
,
and
strained
every
sinew
in
his
frame
to
keep
ahead
of
the
other
boats
.
 
<EOS>
"
Them
's
catchpoles
,
I
s'pose
,
Sir
,
arter
the
gemman
with
a
writ
?
<EOS>
"
he
observed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Something
worse
,
I
fear
,
"
Wood
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
do
n't
think
as
how
they
're
crimps
,
do
you
?
"
<EOS>
Ben
inquired
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
I
think
,
"
Wood
answered
sulkily
;
and
he
bent
his
eyes
upon
the
water
,
as
if
he
wished
to
avert
his
attention
forcibly
from
the
scene
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
something
that
inspires
a
feeling
of
inexpressible
melancholy
in
sailing
on
a
dark
night
upon
the
Thames
.
<EOS>
The
sounds
that
reach
the
ear
,
and
the
objects
that
meet
the
eye
,
are
all
calculated
to
awaken
a
train
of
sad
and
serious
contemplation
.
<EOS>
The
ripple
of
the
water
against
the
boat
,
as
its
keel
cleaves
through
the
stream
--
the
darkling
current
hurrying
by
--
the
indistinctly
-
seen
craft
,
of
all
forms
and
all
sizes
,
hovering
around
,
and
making
their
way
in
ghost
-
like
silence
,
or
warning
each
other
of
their
approach
by
cries
,
that
,
heard
from
afar
,
have
something
doleful
in
their
note
--
<EOS>
the
solemn
shadows
cast
by
the
bridges
--
the
deeper
gloom
of
the
echoing
arches
--
the
lights
glimmering
from
the
banks
--
the
red
reflection
thrown
upon
the
waves
by
a
fire
kindled
on
some
stationary
barge
--
the
tall
and
fantastic
shapes
of
the
houses
,
as
discerned
through
the
obscurity;--these
,
and
other
sights
and
sounds
of
the
same
character
,
give
a
sombre
colour
to
the
thoughts
of
one
who
may
choose
to
indulge
in
meditation
at
such
a
time
and
in
such
a
place
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
otherwise
with
the
carpenter
.
<EOS>
This
was
no
night
for
the
indulgence
of
dreamy
musing
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
night
of
storm
and
terror
,
which
promised
each
moment
to
become
more
stormy
and
more
terrible
.
<EOS>
Not
a
bark
could
be
discerned
on
the
river
,
except
those
already
mentioned
.
<EOS>
The
darkness
was
almost
palpable
;
and
the
wind
which
,
hitherto
,
had
been
blowing
in
gusts
,
was
suddenly
lulled
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
dead
calm
.
<EOS>
But
this
calm
was
more
awful
than
the
previous
roaring
of
the
blast
.
 
<EOS>
Amid
this
portentous
hush
,
the
report
of
a
pistol
reached
the
carpenter
's
ears
;
and
,
raising
his
head
at
the
sound
,
he
beheld
a
sight
which
filled
him
with
fresh
apprehensions
.
 
<EOS>
By
the
light
of
a
torch
borne
at
the
stern
of
the
hostile
wherry
,
he
saw
that
the
pursuers
had
approached
within
a
short
distance
of
the
object
of
their
quest
.
<EOS>
The
shot
had
taken
effect
upon
the
waterman
who
rowed
the
chase
.
<EOS>
He
had
abandoned
his
oars
,
and
the
boat
was
drifting
with
the
stream
towards
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
Escape
was
now
impossible
.
<EOS>
Darrell
stood
erect
in
the
bark
,
with
his
drawn
sword
in
hand
,
prepared
to
repel
the
attack
of
his
assailants
,
who
,
in
their
turn
,
seemed
to
await
with
impatience
the
moment
which
should
deliver
him
into
their
power
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
not
to
tarry
long
.
<EOS>
In
another
instant
,
the
collision
took
place
.
<EOS>
The
watermen
,
who
manned
the
larger
wherry
,
immediately
shipped
their
oars
,
grappled
with
the
drifting
skiff
,
and
held
it
fast
.
<EOS>
Wood
,
then
,
beheld
two
persons
,
one
of
whom
he
recognised
as
Rowland
,
spring
on
board
the
chase
.
<EOS>
A
fierce
struggle
ensued
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
shrill
cry
,
instantly
succeeded
by
a
deep
splash
.
 
<EOS>
"
Put
about
,
waterman
,
for
God
's
sake
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Wood
,
whose
humanity
got
the
better
of
every
personal
consideration
;
"
some
one
is
overboard
.
<EOS>
Give
way
,
and
let
us
render
what
assistance
we
can
to
the
poor
wretch
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
over
with
him
by
this
time
,
master
,
"
replied
Ben
,
turning
the
head
of
his
boat
,
and
rowing
swiftly
towards
the
scene
of
strife
;
"
but
d
--
<EOS>
n
<EOS>
him
<EOS>
,
he
was
the
chap
as
hit
poor
Bill
Thomson
just
now
,
and
I
do
n't
much
care
if
he
should
be
food
for
fishes
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
As
Ben
spoke
,
they
drew
near
the
opposing
parties
.
<EOS>
The
contest
was
now
carried
on
between
Rowland
and
Darrell
.
<EOS>
The
latter
had
delivered
himself
from
one
of
his
assailants
,
the
attendant
,
Davies
.
<EOS>
Hurled
over
the
sides
of
the
skiff
,
the
ruffian
speedily
found
a
watery
grave
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
spring
-
tide
at
half
ebb
;
and
the
current
,
which
was
running
fast
and
furiously
,
bore
him
instantly
away
.
<EOS>
While
the
strife
raged
between
the
principals
,
the
watermen
in
the
larger
wherry
were
occupied
in
stemming
the
force
of
the
torrent
,
and
endeavouring
to
keep
the
boats
,
they
had
lashed
together
,
stationary
.
<EOS>
Owing
to
this
circumstance
,
Mr.
Wood
's
boat
,
impelled
alike
by
oar
and
tide
,
shot
past
the
mark
at
which
it
aimed
;
and
before
it
could
be
again
brought
about
,
the
struggle
had
terminated
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
minutes
,
Darrell
seemed
to
have
the
advantage
in
the
conflict
.
<EOS>
Neither
combatant
could
use
his
sword
;
and
in
strength
the
fugitive
was
evidently
superior
to
his
antagonist
.
<EOS>
The
boat
rocked
violently
with
the
struggle
.
<EOS>
Had
it
not
been
lashed
to
the
adjoining
wherry
,
it
must
have
been
upset
,
and
have
precipitated
the
opponents
into
the
water
.
<EOS>
Rowland
felt
himself
sinking
beneath
the
powerful
grasp
of
his
enemy
.
<EOS>
He
called
to
the
other
attendant
,
who
held
the
torch
.
<EOS>
Understanding
the
appeal
,
the
man
snatched
his
master
's
sword
from
his
grasp
,
and
passed
it
through
Darrell
's
body
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
,
a
heavy
plunge
told
that
the
fugitive
had
been
consigned
to
the
waves
.
 
<EOS>
Darrell
,
however
,
rose
again
instantly
;
and
though
mortally
wounded
,
made
a
desperate
effort
to
regain
the
boat
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
child
!
"
<EOS>
he
groaned
faintly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
reminded
,
"
answered
Rowland
,
who
had
witnessed
his
struggles
with
a
smile
of
gratified
vengeance
;
"
I
had
forgotten
the
accursed
imp
in
this
confusion
.
<EOS>
Take
it
,
"
he
cried
,
lifting
the
babe
from
the
bottom
of
the
boat
,
and
flinging
it
towards
its
unfortunate
father
.
 
<EOS>
The
child
fell
within
a
short
distance
of
Darrell
,
who
,
hearing
the
splash
,
struck
out
in
that
direction
,
and
caught
it
before
it
sank
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
the
sound
of
oars
reached
his
ears
,
and
he
perceived
Mr.
Wood
's
boat
bearing
up
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
he
is
,
waterman
,
"
exclaimed
the
benevolent
carpenter
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
him!--row
for
your
life
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
way
to
miss
him
,
master
,
"
replied
Ben
coolly
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
keep
still
.
<EOS>
The
tide'll
bring
him
to
us
fast
enough
.
"
 
<EOS>
Ben
judged
correctly
.
<EOS>
Borne
along
by
the
current
,
Darrell
was
instantly
at
the
boat
's
side
.
 
<EOS>
"
Seize
this
oar
,
"
vociferated
the
waterman
.
 
<EOS>
"
First
take
the
child
,
"
cried
Darrell
,
holding
up
the
infant
,
and
clinging
to
the
oar
with
a
dying
effort
.
 
<EOS>
"
Give
it
me
,
"
returned
the
carpenter
;
"
all
's
safe
.
<EOS>
Now
lend
me
your
own
hand
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
strength
fails
me
,
"
gasped
the
fugitive
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
climb
the
boat
.
<EOS>
Take
my
child
to
--
<EOS>
it
is
--
<EOS>
oh
God!--I
am
sinking
--
<EOS>
take
it
--
take
it
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Where
?
"
shouted
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
Darrell
attempted
to
reply
.
<EOS>
But
he
could
only
utter
an
inarticulate
exclamation
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
his
grasp
relaxed
,
and
he
sank
to
rise
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
Rowland
,
meantime
,
alarmed
by
the
voices
,
snatched
a
torch
from
his
attendant
,
and
holding
it
over
the
side
of
the
wherry
,
witnessed
the
incident
just
described
.
 
<EOS>
"
Confusion
!
"
<EOS>
cried
he
;
"
there
is
another
boat
in
our
wake
.
<EOS>
They
have
rescued
the
child
.
<EOS>
Loose
the
wherry
,
and
stand
to
your
oars
--
quick
--
quick
!
"
 
<EOS>
These
commands
were
promptly
obeyed
.
<EOS>
The
boat
was
set
free
,
and
the
men
resumed
their
seats
.
<EOS>
Rowland
's
purposes
were
,
however
,
defeated
in
a
manner
as
unexpected
as
appalling
.
 
<EOS>
During
the
foregoing
occurrences
a
dead
calm
prevailed
.
<EOS>
But
as
Rowland
sprang
to
the
helm
,
and
gave
the
signal
for
pursuit
,
a
roar
like
a
volley
of
ordnance
was
heard
aloft
,
and
the
wind
again
burst
its
bondage
.
<EOS>
A
moment
before
,
the
surface
of
the
stream
was
black
as
ink
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
whitening
,
hissing
,
and
seething
like
an
enormous
cauldron
.
<EOS>
The
blast
once
more
swept
over
the
agitated
river
:
whirled
off
the
sheets
of
foam
,
scattered
them
far
and
wide
in
rain
-
drops
,
and
left
the
raging
torrent
blacker
than
before
.
<EOS>
The
gale
had
become
a
hurricane
:
that
hurricane
was
the
most
terrible
that
ever
laid
waste
our
city
.
<EOS>
Destruction
everywhere
marked
its
course
.
<EOS>
Steeples
toppled
,
and
towers
reeled
beneath
its
fury
.
<EOS>
Trees
were
torn
up
by
the
roots
;
many
houses
were
levelled
to
the
ground
;
others
were
unroofed
;
the
leads
on
the
churches
were
ripped
off
,
and
"
shrivelled
up
like
scrolls
of
parchment
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
on
land
or
water
was
spared
by
the
remorseless
gale
.
<EOS>
Most
of
the
vessels
lying
in
the
river
were
driven
from
their
moorings
,
dashed
tumultuously
against
each
other
,
or
blown
ashore
.
<EOS>
All
was
darkness
,
horror
,
confusion
,
ruin
.
<EOS>
Men
fled
from
their
tottering
habitations
,
and
returned
to
them
scared
by
greater
dangers
.
<EOS>
The
end
of
the
world
seemed
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
time
of
universal
havoc
and
despair,--when
all
London
quaked
at
the
voice
of
the
storm,--the
carpenter
,
who
was
exposed
to
its
utmost
fury
,
fared
better
than
might
have
been
anticipated
.
<EOS>
The
boat
in
which
he
rode
was
not
overset
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
,
her
course
had
been
shifted
immediately
after
the
rescue
of
the
child
;
and
,
in
consequence
of
this
movement
,
she
received
the
first
shock
of
the
hurricane
,
which
blew
from
the
southwest
,
upon
her
stern
.
<EOS>
Her
head
dipped
deeply
into
the
current
,
and
she
narrowly
escaped
being
swamped
.
<EOS>
Righting
,
however
,
instantly
afterwards
,
she
scudded
with
the
greatest
rapidity
over
the
boiling
waves
,
to
whose
mercy
she
was
now
entirely
abandoned
.
<EOS>
On
this
fresh
outburst
of
the
storm
,
Wood
threw
himself
instinctively
into
the
bottom
of
the
boat
,
and
clasping
the
little
orphan
to
his
breast
,
endeavoured
to
prepare
himself
to
meet
his
fate
.
 
<EOS>
While
he
was
thus
occupied
,
he
felt
a
rough
grasp
upon
his
arm
,
and
presently
afterwards
Ben
's
lips
approached
close
to
his
ear
.
<EOS>
The
waterman
sheltered
his
mouth
with
his
hand
while
he
spoke
,
or
his
voice
would
have
been
carried
away
by
the
violence
of
the
blast
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
up
,
master
,
"
groaned
Ben
,
"
<EOS>
nothin'
short
of
a
merracle
can
save
us
.
<EOS>
The
boat
's
sure
to
run
foul
o
'
the
bridge
;
and
if
she
'
scapes
stavin
'
above
,
she
'll
be
swamped
to
a
sartainty
below
.
<EOS>
There
'll
be
a
fall
of
above
twelve
foot
<EOS>
o
'
water
,
and
think
o
'
that
on
a
night
as
'
ud
blow
a
whole
fleet
to
the
devil
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Wood
_
did
_
think
of
it
,
and
groaned
aloud
.
 
<EOS>
"
Heaven
help
us
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
;
"
we
were
mad
to
neglect
the
old
sailor
's
advice
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
what
troubles
me
,
"
rejoined
Ben
.
<EOS>
"
I
tell
'
ee
<EOS>
what
,
master
,
if
you
're
more
fortinate
nor
I
am
,
and
get
ashore
,
give
old
saltwater
your
fare
.
<EOS>
I
pledged
my
thumb
that
,
dead
or
alive
,
I
'd
pay
the
wager
if
I
lost
;
and
I
should
like
to
be
as
good
as
my
word
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
--
I
will
,
"
replied
Wood
hastily
.
<EOS>
"
Was
that
thunder
?
"
<EOS>
he
faltered
,
as
a
terrible
clap
was
heard
overhead
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
;
it
's
only
a
fresh
gale
,
"
<EOS>
Ben
returned
:
"
hark
!
<EOS>
now
it
comes
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Lord
have
mercy
upon
us
,
miserable
sinners
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Wood
,
as
a
fearful
gust
dashed
the
water
over
the
side
of
the
boat
,
deluging
him
with
spray
.
 
<EOS>
The
hurricane
had
now
reached
its
climax
.
<EOS>
The
blast
shrieked
,
as
if
exulting
in
its
wrathful
mission
.
<EOS>
Stunning
and
continuous
,
the
din
seemed
almost
to
take
away
the
power
of
hearing
.
<EOS>
He
,
who
had
faced
the
gale
,
would
have
been
instantly
stifled
.
<EOS>
Piercing
through
every
crevice
in
the
clothes
,
it
,
in
some
cases
,
tore
them
from
the
wearer
's
limbs
,
or
from
his
grasp
.
<EOS>
It
penetrated
the
skin
;
benumbed
the
flesh
;
paralysed
the
faculties
.
<EOS>
The
intense
darkness
added
to
the
terror
of
the
storm
.
<EOS>
The
destroying
angel
hurried
by
,
shrouded
in
his
gloomiest
apparel
.
<EOS>
None
saw
,
though
all
felt
,
his
presence
,
and
heard
the
thunder
of
his
voice
.
<EOS>
Imagination
,
coloured
by
the
obscurity
,
peopled
the
air
with
phantoms
.
<EOS>
Ten
thousand
steeds
appeared
to
be
trampling
aloft
,
charged
with
the
work
of
devastation
.
<EOS>
Awful
shapes
seemed
to
flit
by
,
borne
on
the
wings
of
the
tempest
,
animating
and
directing
its
fury
.
<EOS>
The
actual
danger
was
lost
sight
of
in
these
wild
apprehensions
;
and
many
timorous
beings
were
scared
beyond
reason
's
verge
by
the
excess
of
their
fears
.
 
<EOS>
This
had
<EOS>
well
nigh
been
the
case
with
the
carpenter
.
<EOS>
He
was
roused
from
the
stupor
of
despair
into
which
he
had
sunk
by
the
voice
of
Ben
,
who
roared
in
his
ear
,
"
The
bridge!--the
bridge
!
"
    
CHAPTER
VII
.
 
<EOS>
Old
London
Bridge
.
  
<EOS>
London
,
at
the
period
of
this
history
,
boasted
only
a
single
bridge
.
<EOS>
But
that
bridge
was
more
remarkable
than
any
the
metropolis
now
possesses
.
<EOS>
Covered
with
houses
,
from
one
end
to
the
other
,
this
reverend
and
picturesque
structure
presented
the
appearance
of
a
street
across
the
Thames
.
<EOS>
It
was
as
if
Grace
-
church
Street
,
with
all
its
shops
,
its
magazines
,
and
ceaseless
throng
of
passengers
,
were
stretched
from
the
Middlesex
to
the
Surrey
shore
.
<EOS>
The
houses
were
older
,
the
shops
gloomier
,
and
the
thoroughfare
narrower
,
it
is
true
;
but
the
bustle
,
the
crowd
,
the
street
-
like
air
was
the
same
.
<EOS>
Then
the
bridge
had
arched
gateways
,
bristling
with
spikes
,
and
garnished
<EOS>
(
as
all
ancient
gateways
ought
to
be
)
with
the
heads
of
traitors
.
<EOS>
In
olden
days
it
boasted
a
chapel
,
dedicated
to
Saint
Thomas
;
beneath
which
there
was
a
crypt
curiously
constructed
amid
the
arches
,
where
"
was
sepultured
Peter
the
Chaplain
of
Colechurch
,
who
began
the
Stone
Bridge
at
London
:
"
and
it
still
boasted
an
edifice
(
though
now
in
rather
a
tumbledown
condition
)
which
had
once
vied
with
a
palace,--we
mean
Nonesuch
House
.
<EOS>
The
other
buildings
stood
close
together
in
rows
;
and
so
valuable
was
every
inch
of
room
accounted
,
that
,
in
many
cases
,
cellars
,
and
even
habitable
apartments
,
were
constructed
in
the
solid
masonry
of
the
piers
.
 
<EOS>
Old
London
Bridge
(
the
grandsire
of
the
present
erection
)
was
supported
on
nineteen
arches
,
each
of
which
     
Would
a
Rialto
make
for
depth
and
height
!
 
<EOS>
The
arches
stood
upon
enormous
piers
;
the
piers
on
starlings
,
or
jetties
,
built
far
out
into
the
river
to
break
the
force
of
the
tide
.
 
<EOS>
Roused
by
Ben
's
warning
,
the
carpenter
looked
up
and
could
just
perceive
the
dusky
outline
of
the
bridge
looming
through
the
darkness
,
and
rendered
indistinctly
visible
by
the
many
lights
that
twinkled
from
the
windows
of
the
lofty
houses
.
<EOS>
As
he
gazed
at
these
lights
,
they
suddenly
seemed
to
disappear
,
and
a
tremendous
shock
was
felt
throughout
the
frame
of
the
boat
.
<EOS>
Wood
started
to
his
feet
.
<EOS>
He
found
that
the
skiff
had
been
dashed
against
one
of
the
buttresses
of
the
bridge
.
 
<EOS>
"
Jump
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Ben
,
in
a
voice
of
thunder
.
 
<EOS>
Wood
obeyed
.
<EOS>
His
fears
supplied
him
with
unwonted
vigour
.
<EOS>
Though
the
starling
was
more
than
two
feet
above
the
level
of
the
water
,
he
alighted
with
his
little
charge
--
which
he
had
never
for
an
instant
quitted
--
in
safety
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Poor
Ben
was
not
so
fortunate
.
<EOS>
Just
as
he
was
preparing
to
follow
,
the
wherry
containing
Rowland
and
his
men
,
which
had
drifted
in
their
wake
,
was
dashed
against
his
boat
.
<EOS>
The
violence
of
the
collision
nearly
threw
him
backwards
,
and
caused
him
to
swerve
as
he
sprang
.
<EOS>
His
foot
touched
the
rounded
edge
of
the
starling
,
and
glanced
off
,
precipitating
him
into
the
water
.
<EOS>
As
he
fell
,
he
caught
at
the
projecting
masonry
.
<EOS>
But
the
stone
was
slippery
;
and
the
tide
,
which
here
began
to
feel
the
influence
of
the
fall
,
was
running
with
frightful
velocity
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
make
good
his
hold
.
<EOS>
But
,
uttering
a
loud
cry
,
he
was
swept
away
by
the
headlong
torrent
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Wood
heard
the
cry
.
<EOS>
But
his
own
situation
was
too
perilous
to
admit
of
his
rendering
any
assistance
to
the
ill
-
fated
waterman
.
<EOS>
He
fancied
,
indeed
,
that
he
beheld
a
figure
spring
upon
the
starling
at
the
moment
when
the
boats
came
in
contact
;
but
,
as
he
could
perceive
no
one
near
him
,
he
concluded
he
must
have
been
mistaken
.
 
<EOS>
In
order
to
make
Mr.
Wood
's
present
position
,
and
subsequent
proceedings
fully
intelligible
,
it
may
be
necessary
to
give
some
notion
of
the
shape
and
structure
of
the
platform
on
which
he
had
taken
refuge
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
said
,
that
the
pier
of
each
arch
,
or
lock
of
Old
London
Bridge
,
was
defended
from
the
force
of
the
tide
by
a
huge
projecting
spur
called
a
starling
.
<EOS>
These
starlings
varied
in
width
,
according
to
the
bulk
of
the
pier
they
surrounded
.
<EOS>
But
they
were
all
pretty
nearly
of
the
same
length
,
and
built
somewhat
after
the
model
of
a
boat
,
having
extremities
as
sharp
and
pointed
as
the
keel
of
a
canoe
.
<EOS>
Cased
and
ribbed
with
stone
,
and
braced
with
horizontal
beams
of
timber
,
the
piles
,
which
formed
the
foundation
of
these
jetties
,
had
resisted
the
strong
encroachments
of
the
current
for
centuries
.
<EOS>
Some
of
them
are
now
buried
at
the
bottom
of
the
Thames
.
<EOS>
The
starling
,
on
which
the
carpenter
stood
,
was
the
fourth
from
the
Surrey
shore
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
three
yards
in
width
,
and
a
few
more
in
length
;
but
it
was
covered
with
ooze
and
slime
,
and
the
waves
continually
broke
over
it
.
<EOS>
The
transverse
spars
before
mentioned
were
as
slippery
as
ice
;
and
the
hollows
between
them
were
filled
ankle
-
deep
with
water
.
 
<EOS>
The
carpenter
threw
himself
flat
upon
the
starling
to
avoid
the
fury
of
the
wind
.
<EOS>
But
in
this
posture
he
fared
worse
than
ever
.
<EOS>
If
he
ran
less
risk
of
being
blown
over
,
he
stood
a
much
greater
chance
of
being
washed
off
,
or
stifled
.
<EOS>
As
he
lay
on
his
back
,
he
fancied
himself
gradually
slipping
off
the
platform
.
<EOS>
Springing
to
his
feet
in
an
ecstasy
of
terror
,
he
stumbled
,
and
had
well
nigh
realized
his
worst
apprehensions
.
<EOS>
He
,
next
,
tried
to
clamber
up
the
flying
buttresses
and
soffits
of
the
pier
,
in
the
hope
of
reaching
some
of
the
windows
and
other
apertures
with
which
,
as
a
man
-
of
-
war
is
studded
with
port
-
holes
,
the
sides
of
the
bridge
were
pierced
.
<EOS>
But
this
wild
scheme
was
speedily
abandoned
;
and
,
nerved
by
despair
,
the
carpenter
resolved
to
hazard
an
attempt
,
from
the
execution
,
almost
from
the
contemplation
,
of
which
he
had
hitherto
shrunk
.
<EOS>
This
was
to
pass
under
the
arch
,
along
the
narrow
ledge
of
the
starling
,
and
,
if
possible
,
attain
the
eastern
platform
,
<EOS>
where
,
protected
by
the
bridge
,
he
would
suffer
less
from
the
excessive
violence
of
the
gale
.
 
<EOS>
Assured
,
if
he
remained
much
longer
where
he
was
,
he
would
inevitably
perish
,
Wood
recommended
himself
to
the
protection
of
Heaven
,
and
began
his
perilous
course
.
<EOS>
Carefully
sustaining
the
child
which
,
even
in
that
terrible
extremity
,
he
had
not
the
heart
to
abandon
,
he
fell
upon
his
knees
,
and
,
guiding
himself
with
his
right
hand
,
crept
slowly
on
.
<EOS>
He
had
scarcely
entered
the
arch
,
when
the
indraught
was
so
violent
,
and
the
noise
of
the
wind
so
dreadful
and
astounding
,
that
he
almost
determined
to
relinquish
the
undertaking
.
<EOS>
But
the
love
of
life
prevailed
over
his
fears
.
<EOS>
He
went
on
.
 
<EOS>
The
ledge
,
along
which
he
crawled
,
was
about
a
foot
wide
.
<EOS>
In
length
the
arch
exceeded
seventy
feet
.
<EOS>
To
the
poor
carpenter
it
seemed
an
endless
distance
.
<EOS>
When
,
by
slow
and
toilsome
efforts
,
he
had
arrived
midway
,
something
obstructed
his
further
progress
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
huge
stone
placed
there
by
some
workmen
occupied
in
repairing
the
structure
.
<EOS>
Cold
drops
stood
upon
Wood
's
brow
,
as
he
encountered
this
obstacle
.
<EOS>
To
return
was
<EOS>
impossible,--to
raise
himself
certain
destruction
.
<EOS>
He
glanced
downwards
at
the
impetuous
torrent
,
which
he
could
perceive
shooting
past
him
with
lightning
swiftness
in
the
gloom
.
<EOS>
He
listened
to
the
thunder
of
the
fall
now
mingling
with
the
roar
of
the
blast
;
and
,
driven
almost
frantic
by
what
he
heard
and
saw
,
he
pushed
with
all
his
force
against
the
stone
.
<EOS>
To
his
astonishment
and
delight
it
yielded
to
the
pressure
,
toppled
over
the
ledge
,
and
sank
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
hubbub
and
tumult
around
him
,
that
the
carpenter
could
not
hear
its
plunge
into
the
flood
.
<EOS>
His
course
,
however
,
was
no
longer
interrupted
,
and
he
crept
on
.
 
<EOS>
After
encountering
other
dangers
,
and
being
twice
,
compelled
to
fling
himself
flat
upon
his
face
to
avoid
slipping
from
the
wet
and
slimy
pathway
,
he
was
at
length
about
to
emerge
from
the
lock
,
when
,
to
his
inexpressible
horror
,
he
found
he
had
lost
the
child
!
 
<EOS>
All
the
blood
in
his
veins
rushed
to
his
heart
,
and
he
shook
in
every
limb
as
he
made
this
discovery
.
<EOS>
A
species
of
vertigo
seized
him
.
<EOS>
His
brain
reeled
.
<EOS>
He
fancied
that
the
whole
fabric
of
the
bridge
was
cracking
over
head,--that
the
arch
was
tumbling
upon
him,--that
the
torrent
was
swelling
around
him
,
whirling
him
off
,
and
about
to
bury
him
in
the
deafening
abyss
.
<EOS>
He
shrieked
with
agony
,
and
clung
with
desperate
tenacity
to
the
roughened
stones
.
<EOS>
But
calmer
thoughts
quickly
succeeded
.
<EOS>
On
taxing
his
recollection
,
the
whole
circumstance
rushed
to
mind
with
painful
distinctness
.
<EOS>
He
remembered
that
,
before
he
attempted
to
dislodge
the
stone
,
he
had
placed
the
child
in
a
cavity
of
the
pier
,
which
the
granite
mass
had
been
intended
to
fill
.
<EOS>
This
obstacle
being
removed
,
in
his
eagerness
to
proceed
,
he
had
forgotten
to
take
his
little
charge
with
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
still
possible
the
child
might
be
in
safety
.
<EOS>
And
so
bitterly
did
the
carpenter
reproach
himself
with
his
neglect
,
that
he
resolved
,
at
all
risks
,
to
go
back
in
search
of
it
.
<EOS>
Acting
upon
this
humane
determination
,
he
impelled
himself
slowly
<EOS>
backwards,--for
he
did
not
dare
to
face
the
blast,--and
with
incredible
labour
and
fatigue
reached
the
crevice
.
<EOS>
His
perseverance
was
amply
rewarded
.
<EOS>
The
child
was
still
safe
.
<EOS>
It
lay
undisturbed
in
the
remotest
corner
of
the
recess
.
 
<EOS>
So
overjoyed
was
the
carpenter
with
the
successful
issue
of
his
undertaking
,
that
he
scarcely
paused
a
moment
to
recruit
himself
;
but
,
securing
the
child
,
set
out
upon
his
return
.
<EOS>
Retracing
his
steps
,
he
arrived
,
without
further
accident
,
at
the
eastern
platform
of
the
starling
.
<EOS>
As
he
anticipated
,
he
was
here
comparatively
screened
from
the
fury
of
the
wind
;
and
when
he
gazed
upon
the
roaring
fall
beneath
him
,
visible
through
the
darkness
in
a
glistening
sheet
of
foam
,
his
heart
overflowed
with
gratitude
for
his
providential
deliverance
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
moved
about
upon
the
starling
,
Mr.
Wood
became
sensible
that
he
was
not
alone
.
<EOS>
Some
one
was
standing
beside
him
.
<EOS>
This
,
then
,
must
be
the
person
whom
he
had
seen
spring
upon
the
western
platform
at
the
time
of
the
collision
between
the
boats
.
<EOS>
The
carpenter
well
knew
from
the
obstacle
which
had
interfered
with
his
own
progress
,
that
the
unknown
could
not
have
passed
through
the
same
lock
as
himself
.
<EOS>
But
he
might
have
crept
along
the
left
side
of
the
pier
,
and
beneath
the
further
arch
;
whereas
,
Wood
,
as
we
have
seen
,
took
his
course
upon
the
right
.
<EOS>
The
darkness
prevented
the
carpenter
from
discerning
the
features
or
figure
of
the
stranger
;
and
the
ceaseless
din
precluded
the
possibility
of
holding
any
communication
by
words
with
him
.
<EOS>
Wood
,
however
,
made
known
his
presence
to
the
individual
by
laying
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
The
stranger
started
at
the
touch
,
and
spoke
.
<EOS>
But
his
words
were
borne
away
by
the
driving
wind
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
all
attempts
at
conversation
with
his
companion
in
misfortune
in
vain
,
Wood
,
in
order
to
distract
his
thoughts
,
looked
up
at
the
gigantic
structure
standing
,
like
a
wall
of
solid
darkness
,
before
him
.
<EOS>
What
was
his
transport
on
perceiving
that
a
few
yards
above
him
a
light
was
burning
.
<EOS>
The
carpenter
did
not
hesitate
a
moment
.
<EOS>
He
took
a
handful
of
the
gravelly
mud
,
with
which
the
platform
was
covered
,
and
threw
the
small
pebbles
,
one
by
one
,
towards
the
gleam
.
<EOS>
A
pane
of
glass
was
shivered
by
each
stone
.
<EOS>
The
signal
of
distress
was
evidently
understood
.
<EOS>
The
light
disappeared
.
<EOS>
The
window
was
shortly
after
opened
,
and
a
rope
ladder
,
with
a
lighted
horn
lantern
attached
to
it
,
let
down
.
 
<EOS>
Wood
grasped
his
companion
's
arm
to
attract
his
attention
to
this
unexpected
means
of
escape
.
<EOS>
The
ladder
was
now
within
reach
.
<EOS>
Both
advanced
towards
it
,
when
,
by
the
light
of
the
lantern
,
Wood
beheld
,
in
the
countenance
of
the
stranger
,
the
well
-
remembered
and
stern
features
of
Rowland
.
 
<EOS>
The
carpenter
trembled
;
for
he
perceived
Rowland
's
gaze
fixed
first
upon
the
infant
,
and
then
on
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
<EOS>
_
is
_
her
child
!
"
<EOS>
shrieked
Rowland
,
in
a
voice
heard
above
the
howling
of
the
tempest
,
"
risen
from
this
roaring
abyss
to
torment
me
.
<EOS>
Its
parents
have
perished
.
<EOS>
And
shall
their
wretched
offspring
live
to
blight
my
hopes
,
and
blast
my
fame
?
<EOS>
Never
!
"
<EOS>
And
,
with
these
words
,
he
grasped
Wood
by
the
throat
,
and
,
despite
his
resistance
,
dragged
him
to
the
very
verge
of
the
platform
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
juncture
,
a
thundering
crash
was
heard
against
the
side
of
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
A
stack
of
chimneys
,
on
the
house
above
them
,
had
yielded
to
the
storm
,
and
descended
in
a
shower
of
bricks
and
stones
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
carpenter
a
moment
afterwards
stretched
out
his
hand
,
scarcely
knowing
whether
he
was
alive
or
dead
,
he
found
himself
alone
.
<EOS>
The
fatal
shower
,
from
which
he
and
his
little
charge
escaped
uninjured
,
had
stricken
his
assailant
and
precipitated
him
into
the
boiling
gulf
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
an
ill
wind
that
blows
nobody
good
,
"
thought
the
carpenter
,
turning
his
attention
to
the
child
,
whose
feeble
struggles
and
cries
proclaimed
that
,
as
yet
,
life
had
not
been
extinguished
by
the
hardships
it
had
undergone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Poor
little
creature
!
"
<EOS>
he
muttered
,
pressing
it
tenderly
to
his
breast
,
as
he
grasped
the
rope
and
clambered
up
to
the
window
:
"
if
thou
hast
,
indeed
,
lost
both
thy
parents
,
as
that
terrible
man
said
just
now
,
thou
art
not
wholly
friendless
and
deserted
,
for
I
myself
will
be
a
father
to
thee
!
<EOS>
And
in
memory
of
this
dreadful
night
,
and
the
death
from
which
I
have
,
been
the
means
of
preserving
thee
,
thou
shalt
bear
the
name
of
THAMES
DARRELL
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
No
sooner
had
Wood
crept
through
the
window
,
than
nature
gave
way
,
and
he
fainted
.
<EOS>
On
coming
to
himself
,
he
found
he
had
been
wrapped
in
a
blanket
and
put
to
bed
with
a
couple
of
hot
bricks
to
his
feet
.
<EOS>
His
first
inquiries
were
concerning
the
child
,
and
he
was
delighted
to
find
that
it
still
lived
and
was
doing
well
.
<EOS>
Every
care
had
been
taken
of
it
,
as
well
as
of
himself
,
by
the
humane
inmates
of
the
house
in
which
he
had
sought
shelter
.
 
<EOS>
About
noon
,
next
day
,
he
was
able
to
move
;
and
the
gale
having
abated
,
he
set
out
homewards
with
his
little
charge
.
 
<EOS>
The
city
presented
a
terrible
picture
of
devastation
.
<EOS>
London
Bridge
had
suffered
a
degree
less
than
most
places
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
almost
choked
up
with
fallen
stacks
of
chimneys
,
broken
beams
of
timber
,
and
shattered
tiles
.
<EOS>
The
houses
overhung
in
a
frightful
manner
,
and
looked
as
if
the
next
gust
would
precipitate
them
into
the
river
.
<EOS>
With
great
difficulty
,
Wood
forced
a
path
through
the
ruins
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
work
of
no
slight
danger
,
for
every
instant
a
wall
,
or
fragment
of
a
building
,
came
crashing
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Thames
Street
was
wholly
impassable
.
<EOS>
Men
were
going
hither
and
thither
with
barrows
,
and
ladders
and
ropes
,
removing
the
rubbish
,
and
trying
to
support
the
tottering
habitations
.
<EOS>
Grace
-
church
Street
was
entirely
deserted
,
except
by
a
few
stragglers
,
whose
curiosity
got
the
better
of
their
fears
;
or
who
,
like
the
carpenter
,
were
compelled
to
proceed
along
it
.
<EOS>
The
tiles
lay
a
foot
thick
in
the
road
.
<EOS>
In
some
cases
they
were
ground
almost
to
powder
;
in
others
,
driven
deeply
into
the
earth
,
as
if
discharged
from
a
piece
of
ordnance
.
<EOS>
The
roofs
and
gables
of
many
of
the
houses
had
been
torn
off
.
<EOS>
The
signs
of
the
shops
were
carried
to
incredible
distances
.
<EOS>
Here
and
there
,
a
building
might
be
seen
with
the
doors
and
windows
driven
in
,
and
all
access
to
it
prevented
by
the
heaps
of
bricks
and
tilesherds
.
 
<EOS>
Through
this
confusion
the
carpenter
struggled
on;--now
ascending
,
now
descending
the
different
mountains
of
rubbish
that
beset
his
path
,
at
the
imminent
peril
of
his
life
and
limbs
,
until
he
arrived
in
Fleet
Street
.
<EOS>
The
hurricane
appeared
to
have
raged
in
this
quarter
with
tenfold
fury
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wood
scarcely
knew
where
he
was
.
<EOS>
The
old
aspect
of
the
place
was
gone
.
<EOS>
In
lieu
of
the
substantial
habitations
which
he
had
gazed
on
overnight
,
he
beheld
a
row
of
falling
scaffoldings
,
for
such
they
seemed
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
dismal
and
depressing
sight
to
see
a
great
city
thus
suddenly
overthrown
;
and
the
carpenter
was
deeply
moved
by
the
spectacle
.
<EOS>
As
usual
,
however
,
on
the
occasion
of
any
great
calamity
,
a
crowd
was
scouring
the
streets
,
whose
sole
object
was
plunder
.
<EOS>
While
involved
in
this
crowd
,
near
Temple
<EOS>
Bar,--where
the
thoroughfare
was
most
dangerous
from
the
masses
of
ruin
that
impeded
it,--an
<EOS>
individual
,
whose
swarthy
features
recalled
to
the
carpenter
one
of
his
tormentors
of
the
previous
night
,
collared
him
,
and
,
with
bitter
imprecations
accused
him
of
stealing
his
child
.
<EOS>
In
vain
Wood
protested
his
innocence
.
<EOS>
The
ruffian
's
companions
took
his
part
.
<EOS>
And
the
infant
,
in
all
probability
,
would
have
been
snatched
from
its
preserver
,
if
a
posse
of
the
watch
(
sent
out
to
maintain
order
and
protect
property
)
had
not
opportunely
arrived
,
and
by
a
vigorous
application
of
their
halberts
dispersed
his
persecutors
,
and
set
him
at
liberty
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Wood
then
took
to
his
heels
,
and
never
once
looked
behind
him
till
he
reached
his
own
dwelling
in
Wych
Street
.
<EOS>
His
wife
met
him
at
the
door
,
and
into
her
hands
he
delivered
his
little
charge
.

CHAPTER
I.
 
<EOS>
The
Idle
Apprentice
.
  
<EOS>
Twelve
years
!
<EOS>
How
many
events
have
occurred
during
that
long
interval
!
<EOS>
how
many
changes
have
taken
place
!
<EOS>
The
whole
aspect
of
things
is
altered
.
<EOS>
The
child
has
sprung
into
a
youth
;
the

Twelve

<EOS>
It

an

Dare
we
look
back
upon

in

trod

pressed

cheerless

Twelve

date

the
occurrences
detailed
in

<EOS>
At
that
time
,
we
were
beneath
the
sway
of
Anne
:
we
are
now
at
the
commencement
of
the
reign
of
George
the
First
.
<EOS>
Passing
at
a
glance
over
the
whole
of
the
intervening
period
;
leaving
in
the
words
of
the
poet
,
     
--The
growth
untried
    
Of
that
wide
gap--
 
we
shall
resume
our
narrative
at
the
beginning
of
June
,
1715
.
 
<EOS>
One
Friday
afternoon
,
in
this
pleasant
month
,
it
chanced
that
Mr.
Wood
,
who
had
been
absent
on
business
during
the
greater
part
of
the
day
,
returned
(
perhaps
not
altogether
undesignedly
)
at
an
earlier
hour
than
was
expected
,
to
his
dwelling
in
Wych
Street
,
Drury
Lane
;
and
was
about
to
enter
his
workshop
,
when
,
not
hearing
any
sound
of
labour
issue
from
within
,
he
began
to
suspect
that
an
apprentice
,
of
whose
habits
of
industry
he
entertained
some
doubt
,
was
neglecting
his
employment
.
<EOS>
Impressed
with
this
idea
,
he
paused
for
a
moment
to
listen
.
<EOS>
But
finding
all
continue
silent
,
he
cautiously
lifted
the
latch
,
and
crept
into
the
room
,
resolved
to
punish
the
offender
in
case
his
suspicions
should
prove
correct
.
 
<EOS>
The
chamber
,
into
which
he
stole
,
like
all
carpenters
'
workshops
,
was
crowded
with
the
implements
and
materials
of
that
ancient
and
honourable
art
.
<EOS>
Saws
,
hammers
,
planes
,
axes
,
augers
,
adzes
,
chisels
,
gimblets
,
and
an
endless
variety
of
tools
were
ranged
,
like
a
stand
of
martial
weapons
at
an
armoury
,
in
racks
against
the
walls
.
<EOS>
Over
these
hung
levels
,
bevels
,
squares
,
and
other
instruments
of
measurement
.
<EOS>
Amid
a
litter
of
nails
without
heads
,
screws
without
worms
,
and
locks
without
wards
,
lay
a
glue
-
pot
and
an
oilstone
,
two
articles
which
their
owner
was
wo
nt
to
term
"
his
right
hand
and
his
left
.
<EOS>
"
On
a
shelf
was
placed
a
row
of
paint
-
jars
;
the
contents
of
which
had
been
daubed
in
rainbow
streaks
upon
the
adjacent
closet
and
window
sill
.
<EOS>
Divers
plans
and
figures
were
chalked
upon
the
walls
;
and
the
spaces
between
them
were
filled
up
with
an
almanack
for
the
year
;
a
godly
ballad
,
adorned
with
a
rude
wood
-
cut
,
purporting
to
be
"
_
<EOS>
The
History
of
Chaste
Susannah
_
;
"
an
old
print
of
the
Seven
Golden
Candlesticks
;
an
abstract
of
the
various
Acts
of
Parliament
against
drinking
,
swearing
,
and
all
manner
of
profaneness
;
and
a
view
of
the
interior
of
Doctor
Daniel
Burgess
's
Presbyterian
meeting
-
house
in
Russell
Court
,
with
portraits
of
the
reverend
gentleman
and
the
principal
members
of
his
flock
.
<EOS>
The
floor
was
thickly
strewn
with
sawdust
and
shavings
;
and
across
the
room
ran
a
long
and
wide
bench
,
furnished
at
one
end
with
a
powerful
vice
;
next
to
which
three
nails
driven
into
the
boards
served
,
it
would
appear
from
the
lump
of
unconsumed
tallow
left
in
their
custody
,
as
a
substitute
for
a
candlestick
.
<EOS>
On
the
bench
was
set
a
quartern
measure
of
gin
,
a
crust
of
bread
,
and
a
slice
of
cheese
.
<EOS>
Attracted
by
the
odour
of
the
latter
dainty
,
a
hungry
cat
had
contrived
to
scratch
open
the
paper
in
which
it
was
wrapped
,
displaying
the
following
words
in
large
characters:--"THE
HISTORY
OF
THE
FOUR
KINGS
,
OR
CHILD
'S
BEST
GUIDE
TO
THE
GALLOWS
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
as
if
to
make
the
moral
more
obvious
,
a
dirty
pack
of
cards
was
scattered
,
underneath
,
upon
the
sawdust
.
<EOS>
Near
the
door
stood
a
pile
of
deal
planks
,
behind
which
the
carpenter
ensconced
himself
in
order
to
reconnoitre
,
unobserved
,
the
proceedings
of
his
idle
apprentice
.
 
<EOS>
Standing
on
tiptoe
,
on
a
joint
-
stool
,
placed
upon
the
bench
,
with
his
back
to
the
door
,
and
a
clasp
-
knife
in
his
hand
,
this
youngster
,
instead
of
executing
his
appointed
task
,
was
occupied
in
carving
his
name
upon
a
beam
,
overhead
.
<EOS>
Boys
,
at
the
time
of
which
we
write
,
were
attired
like
men
of
their
own
day
,
or
certain
charity
-
children
of
ours
;
and
the
stripling
in
question
was
dressed
in
black
plush
breeches
,
and
a
gray
drugget
waistcoat
,
with
immoderately
long
pockets
,
both
of
which
were
evidently
the
cast
-
off
clothes
of
some
one
considerably
his
senior
.
<EOS>
Coat
,
on
the
present
occasion
,
he
had
none
,
it
being
more
convenient
,
as
well
as
agreeable
to
him
,
to
pursue
his
avocations
in
his
shirtsleeves
;
but
,
when
fully
equipped
,
he
wore
a
large
-
cuffed
,
long
-
skirted
garment
,
which
had
once
been
the
property
of
his
master
.
 
<EOS>
In
concealing
himself
behind
the
timber
,
Mr.
Wood
could
not
avoid
making
a
slight
shuffling
sound
.
<EOS>
The
noise
startled
the
apprentice
,
who
instantly
suspended
his
labour
,
and
gazed
anxiously
in
the
direction
<EOS>
whence
he
supposed
it
proceeded
.
<EOS>
His
face
was
that
of
a
quick
,
intelligent
-
looking
boy
,
with
fine
hazel
eyes
,
and
a
clear
olive
complexion
.
<EOS>
His
figure
was
uncommonly
slim
even
for
his
age
,
which
could
not
be
more
than
thirteen
;
and
the
looseness
of
his
garb
made
him
appear
thinner
than
he
was
in
reality
.
<EOS>
But
if
his
frame
was
immature
,
his
looks
were
not
so
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
possess
a
penetration
and
cunning
beyond
his
years
--
to
hide
a
man
's
judgment
under
a
boy
's
mask
.
<EOS>
The
glance
,
which
he
threw
at
the
door
,
was
singularly
expressive
of
his
character
:
it
was
a
mixture
of
alarm
,
effrontery
,
and
resolution
.
<EOS>
In
the
end
,
resolution
triumphed
,
as
it
was
sure
to
do
,
over
the
weaker
emotions
,
and
he
laughed
at
his
fears
.
<EOS>
The
only
part
of
his
otherwise
-
interesting
countenance
,
to
which
one
could
decidedly
object
,
was
the
mouth
;
a
feature
that
,
more
than
any
other
,
is
conceived
to
betray
the
animal
propensities
of
the
possessor
.
<EOS>
If
this
is
true
,
it
must
be
owned
that
the
boy
's
mouth
showed
a
strong
tendency
on
his
part
to
coarse
indulgence
.
<EOS>
The
eyes
,
too
,
though
large
and
bright
,
and
shaded
by
long
lashes
,
seemed
to
betoken
,
as
hazel
eyes
generally
do
in
men
,
a
faithless
and
uncertain
disposition
.
<EOS>
The
cheek
-
bones
were
prominent
:
the
nose
slightly
depressed
,
with
rather
wide
nostrils
;
the
chin
narrow
,
but
well
-
formed
;
the
forehead
broad
and
lofty
;
and
he
possessed
such
an
extraordinary
flexibility
of
muscle
in
this
region
,
that
he
could
elevate
his
eye
-
brows
at
pleasure
up
to
the
very
verge
of
his
sleek
and
shining
black
hair
,
which
,
being
closely
cropped
,
to
admit
of
his
occasionally
wearing
a
wig
,
gave
a
singular
bullet
-
shape
to
his
head
.
<EOS>
Taken
altogether
,
his
physiognomy
resembled
one
of
those
vagabond
heads
which
Murillo
delighted
to
paint
,
and
for
which
Guzman
d'Alfarache
,
Lazarillo
de
Tormes
,
or
Estevanillo
Gonzalez
might
have
sat:--faces
that
almost
make
one
in
love
with
roguery
,
they
seem
so
full
of
vivacity
and
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
There
was
all
the
knavery
,
and
more
than
all
the
drollery
of
a
Spanish
picaroon
in
the
laughing
eyes
of
the
English
apprentice
;
and
,
with
a
little
more
warmth
and
sunniness
of
skin
on
the
side
of
the
latter
,
the
resemblance
between
them
would
have
been
complete
.
 
<EOS>
Satisfied
,
as
he
thought
,
that
he
had
nothing
to
apprehend
<EOS>
,
the
boy
resumed
his
task
,
chanting
,
as
he
plied
his
knife
with
redoubled
assiduity
,
the
following
--
not
inappropriate
strains:--
     
<EOS>
THE
NEWGATE
STONE
.
     
<EOS>
When
Claude
Du
Val
was
in
Newgate
thrown
,
    
He
carved
his
name
on
the
dungeon
stone
;
    
Quoth
<EOS>
a
dubsman
,
who
gazed
on
the
shattered
wall
,
    
<EOS>
"
You

carved
your
epitaph

"
 
<EOS>
"
This
S
wants
a
little
deepening

"
mused
the
apprentice
,
retouching
the
letter
in
question
;
"
ay
,
that
's
better
.
"
     
<EOS>
Du
Val
was
hang'd
,
and
the
next
who
came
    
<EOS>
On
the
selfsame
stone
inscribed
his
name
:
    
<EOS>
"
Aha

<EOS>
quoth
the
dubsman
,
with
devilish
glee

,

lay

carved
their

Share

fate
of

brave

<EOS>
"
Save

"
<EOS>
continued
the
apprentice
,
"
<EOS>
I
hope
this
beam
does
n't
resemble
the
Newgate
stone

or
I
may
chance
,
like
the
great
men
the
song
speaks
of
,
to
swing
on

Tyburn
tree

pains

<EOS>
No

o
<EOS>
'
that.--Though
if
my
name
should
become
as
famous
as
theirs
,
it
would
n't
much
matter

The
prospect
of
the
gallows
would
never
deter
me
from
taking
to

road

I
were
so
inclined

<EOS>
Full
twenty
highwaymen
blithe
and
bold

Rattled
their

cried
the
boy
,
leaping
from
the
stool
,

drawing
back
a
few
paces
on
the
bench
to
examine
his
performance,--"that'll
do

<EOS>
Claude

The

inscribed

as
it
has
been
carefully
preserved

the
subsequent
owners

"
I

half
a

cried
Jack
,
as
he
closed
the
knife
,
and
put
it
in
his
pocket

<EOS>
"
The

thundered
a
voice
from
behind
,
that
filled
the
apprentice
with
dismay
.
<EOS>
"
Come
down

I

<EOS>
Upon

,
Mr.

caught
hold
of
Jack

dragged
him
off

bench

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so

continued
the
carpenter
,
cuffing
him
soundly,--"rob
<EOS>

Jack

suppose

<EOS>
"
Yes

replied
Jack
sullenly
,
"

"
 
<EOS>
Amazed
at
the
boy
's
assurance
,
Wood
left
off
boxing
his
ears
for
a
moment
,
and
,
looking
at
him
steadfastly
,
said
in
a
grave
tone
,
"
Jack

<EOS>
"
Better
be

retorted
the
lad
with
a
malicious
grin
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
by

sirrah

"
<EOS>
cried
Wood
,
reddening
with
anger
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
dare
to
insinuate
that
Mrs.
Wood
governs
me

<EOS>
"
It
's
plain
you
ca
n't
govern
yourself

at
all
events
,
"
replied
Jack
coolly
;
"
but
,
be
that
as
it
may
,
I
wo
n't
be
struck
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
"
echoed
Wood
furiously
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
call
neglecting
your
work
,
and
singing
flash
songs
nothing
?
<EOS>
Zounds
!
<EOS>
you
incorrigible
rascal
,
many
a
master
would
have
taken
you
before
a
magistrate
,
and
prayed
for
your
solitary
confinement
in
Bridewell
for
the
least
of
these
offences
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
be
more
lenient
,
and
content
myself
with
merely
chastising
you
,
on
condition--
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
do
as
you
please
,
master
,
"
interrupted
Jack
,
thrusting
his
hand
into
his
pocket
,
as
if
in
search
of
the
knife
;
"
but
I
would
n't
advise
you
to
lay
hands
on
me
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Wood
glanced
at
the
hardy
offender
,
and
not
liking
the
expression
of
his
countenance
,
thought
it
advisable
to
postpone
the
execution
of
his
threats
to
a
more
favourable
opportunity
.
<EOS>
So
,
by
way
of
gaining
time
,
he
resolved
to
question
him
further
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
did
you
learn
the
song
I
heard
just
now
?
<EOS>
"
he
demanded
,
in
an
authoritative
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
the
Black
Lion
in
our
street
,
"
replied
Jack
,
without
hesitation
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
worst
house
in
the
neighbourhood
--
the
constant
haunt
of
reprobates
and
thieves
,
"
groaned
Wood
.
"
<EOS>
And
who
taught
it
you
--
the
landlord
,
Joe
Hind
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
;
one
Blueskin
,
a
fellow
who
frequents
the
Lion
,
"
answered
Jack
,
with
a
degree
of
candour
that
astonished
his
master
nearly
as
much
as
his
confidence
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
that
song
that
put
it
into
my
head
to
cut
my
name
on
the
beam
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
white
wall
is
a
fool
's
paper
,
Jack,--remember
that
,
"
rejoined
Wood
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Pretty
company
for
an
apprentice
to
keep!--pretty
houses
for
an
apprentice
to
frequent
!
<EOS>
Why
,
the
rascal
you
mention
is
a
notorious
house
-
breaker
.
<EOS>
He
was
tried
at
the
last
Old
Bailey
sessions
;
and
only
escaped
the
gallows
by
impeaching
his
accomplices
.
<EOS>
Jonathan
Wild
brought
him
off
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
happen
to
know
Jonathan
Wild
,
master
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Jack
,
altering
his
tone
,
and
assuming
a
more
respectful
demeanour
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
seen
him
some
years
ago
,
I
believe
,
"
answered
Wood
;
"
and
,
though
he
must
be
much
changed
by
this
time
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
I
should
know
him
again
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
short
man
,
is
n't
he
,
about
your
height
,
Sir,--with
a
yellow
beard
,
and
a
face
as
sly
as
a
fox
's
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hem
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Wood
,
coughing
slightly
to
conceal
a
smile
;
"
the
description
's
not
amiss
.
<EOS>
But
why
do
you
ask
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Because--
"
stammered
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Speak
out
--
don't
be
alarmed
,
"
said
Wood
,
in
a
kind
and
encouraging
tone
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
've
done
wrong
,
confess
it
,
and
I
'll
forgive
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
deserve
to
be
forgiven
!
"
<EOS>
returned
Jack
,
bursting
into
tears
;
"
for
I
'm
afraid
I
've
done
very
wrong
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
this
,
Sir
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
taking
a
key
from
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
did
you
find
it
!
"
<EOS>
asked
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
given
me
by
a
man
who
was
drinking
t'other
night
with
Blueskin
at
the
Lion
!
<EOS>
and
who
,
though
he
slouched
his
hat
over
his
eyes
,
and
muffled
his
chin
in
a
handkerchief
,
must
have
been
Jonathan
Wild
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Where
did
_
he
_
get
it
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Wood
,
in
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
I
ca
n't
say
.
<EOS>
But
he
promised
to
give
me
a
couple
of
guineas
if
I
'd
ascertain
whether
it
fitted
your
locks
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Zounds
!
"
exclaimed
Wood
;
"
it
's
my
old
master
-
key
.
<EOS>
This
key
,
"
he
added
,
taking
it
from
the
boy
,
"
was
purloined
from
me
by
your
father
,
Jack
.
<EOS>
What
he
intended
to
do
with
it
is
of
little
consequence
now
.
<EOS>
But
before
he
suffered
at
Tyburn
,
he
charged
your
mother
to
restore
it
.
<EOS>
She
lost
it
in
the
Mint
.
<EOS>
Jonathan
Wild
must
have
stolen
it
from
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
must
,
"
exclaimed
Jack
,
hastily
;
"
but
only
let
me
have
it
<EOS>
till
to
-
morrow
,
and
if
I
do
n't
entrap
him
in
a
snare
from
which
,
with
all
his
cunning
,
he
shall
find
it
difficult
to
escape
,
my
name
's
not
Jack
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
through
your
design
,
Jack
,
"
returned
the
carpenter
,
gravely
;
"
but
I
do
n't
like
under
-
hand
work
.
<EOS>
Even
when
you
've
a
knave
to
deal
with
,
let
your
actions
be
plain
,
and
above
-
board
.
<EOS>
That
's
my
maxim
;
and
it
's
the
maxim
of
every
honest
man
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
great
matter
,
I
must
own
,
to
bring
Jonathan
Wild
to
justice
.
<EOS>
But
I
ca
n't
consent
to
the
course
you
would
pursue
--
at
least
,
not
till
I
've
given
it
due
consideration
.
<EOS>
In
regard
to
yourself
,
you
've
had
a
very
narrow
escape
.
<EOS>
Wild
's
intention
,
doubtless
,
was
to
use
you
as
far
as
he
found
necessary
,
and
then
to
sell
you
.
<EOS>
Let
this
be
a
caution
to
you
in
future
--
with
whom
,
and
about
what
you
deal
.
<EOS>
We
're
told
,
that
'
Whoso
is
partner
with
a
thief
hateth
his
own
soul
.
'
<EOS>
Avoid
taverns
and
bad
company
,
and
you
may
yet
do
well
.
<EOS>
You
promise
to
become
a
first
-
rate
workman
.
<EOS>
But
you
want
one
quality
,
without
which
all
others
are
valueless
.
<EOS>
You
want
industry
--
you
want
steadiness
.
<EOS>
Idleness
is
the
key
of
beggary
,
Jack
.
<EOS>
If
you
do
n't
conquer
this
disgraceful
propensity
in
time
,
you
'll
soon
come
to
want
;
and
then
nothing
can
save
you
.
<EOS>
Be
warned
by
your
father
's
fate
.
<EOS>
As
you
brew
so
must
you
drink
.
<EOS>
I
've
engaged
to
watch
over
you
as
a
son
,
and
I
_
will
_
do
so
as
far
as
I
'm
able
;
but
if
you
neglect
my
advice
,
what
chance
have
I
of
benefitting
you
?
<EOS>
On
one
point
I
've
made
up
my
mind
--
you
shall
either
obey
me
,
or
leave
me
.
<EOS>
Please
yourself
.
<EOS>
Here
are
your
indentures
,
if
you
choose
to
seek
another
master
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
_
will
_
obey
you
,
master,--indeed
<EOS>
I
will
!
"
<EOS>
implored
Jack
,
seriously
alarmed
at
the
carpenter
's
calm
displeasure
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
see
.
<EOS>
Good
words
,
without
deeds
,
are
rushes
and
reeds
.
<EOS>
And
now
take
away
those
cards
,
and
never
let
me
see
them
again
.
<EOS>
Drive
away
the
cat
;
throw
that
measure
of
gin
through
the
window
;
and
tell
me
why
you
've
not
so
much
as
touched
the
packing
-
case
for
Lady
Trafford
,
which
I
particularly
desired
you
to
complete
against
my
return
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
sent
home
this
evening
.
<EOS>
She
leaves
town
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
shall
be
ready
in
two
hours
,
"
answered
Jack
,
seizing
a
piece
of
wood
and
a
plane
;
"
it
is
n't
more
than
four
o'clock
.
<EOS>
I
'll
engage
to
get
the
job
done
by
six
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
expect
you
home
before
that
hour
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Jack
,
"
said
Wood
,
shaking
his
head
,
"
where
there
's
a
will
there
's
a
way
.
<EOS>
You
can
do
anything
you
please
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
get
you
to
imitate
Thames
Darrell
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
I
understand
the
business
of
a
carpenter
much
better
than
he
does
,
"
replied
Jack
,
adroitly
adjusting
the
board
,
and
using
the
plane
with
the
greatest
rapidity
.
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
,
"
replied
Wood
,
doubtfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thames
was
always
your
favourite
,
"
observed
Jack
,
as
he
fastened
another
piece
of
wood
on
the
teeth
of
the
iron
stopper
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
made
no
distinction
between
you
,
hitherto
,
"
answered
Wood
;
"
nor
shall
I
do
so
,
unless
I
'm
compelled
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
had
the
hard
work
to
do
,
at
all
events
,
"
rejoined
Jack
,
"
<EOS>
But
I
wo
n't
complain
.
<EOS>
I
'd
do
anything
for
Thames
Darrell
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
Thames
Darrell
would
do
anything
for
you
,
Jack
,
"
replied
a
blithe
voice
.
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
,
father
!
"
continued
the
new
-
comer
,
addressing
Wood
.
"
<EOS>
Has
Jack
displeased
you
?
<EOS>
If
so
,
overlook
his
fault
this
once
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
he
'll
do
his
best
to
content
you
.
<EOS>
Wo
n't
you
,
Jack
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
I
will
,
"
answered
Sheppard
,
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
it
thunders
,
the
thief
becomes
honest
,
"
muttered
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
"
Can
I
help
you
,
Jack
?
"
asked
Thames
,
taking
up
a
plane
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
let
him
alone
,
"
interposed
Wood
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
undertaken
to
finish
this
job
by
six
o'clock
,
and
I
wish
to
see
whether
he
'll
be
as
good
as
his
word
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
'll
have
hard
work
to
do
it
by
that
time
,
father
,
"
remonstrated
Thames
;
"
you
'd
better
let
me
help
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
On
no
account
,
"
rejoined
Wood
peremptorily
.
<EOS>
"
A
little
extra
exertion
will
teach
him
the
advantage
of
diligence
at
the
proper
season
.
<EOS>
Lost
ground
must
be
regained
.
<EOS>
I
need
scarcely
ask
whether
you
've
executed
your
appointed
task
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
You
're
never
behindhand
.
"
 
<EOS>
Thames
turned
away
at
the
question
,
which
he
felt
might
be
construed
into
a
reproach
.
<EOS>
But
Sheppard
answered
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Darrell
's
job
was
done
early
this
morning
,
"
he
said
;
"
and
if
I
'd
attended
to
his
advice
,
the
packing
-
case
would
have
been
finished
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
trusted
too
much
to
your
own
skill
,
Jack
,
"
rejoined
Thames
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
could
work
as
fast
as
you
,
I
might
afford
to
be
as
idle
.
<EOS>
See
how
he
gets
on
,
father
,
"
he
added
,
appealing
to
Wood
:
"
the
box
seems
to
grow
under
his
hands
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
noble
-
hearted
little
fellow
,
Thames
,
"
rejoined
Wood
,
casting
a
look
of
pride
and
affection
at
his
adopted
son
,
whose
head
he
gently
patted
;
"
and
give
promise
of
a
glorious
manhood
.
"
 
<EOS>
Thames
Darrell
was
,
indeed
,
a
youth
of
whom
a
person
of
far
greater
worldly
consequence
than
the
worthy
carpenter
might
have
been
justly
proud
.
<EOS>
Though
a
few
months
younger
than
his
companion
Jack
Sheppard
,
he
was
half
a
head
taller
,
and
much
more
robustly
formed
.
<EOS>
The
two
friends
contrasted
strikingly
with
each
other
.
<EOS>
In
Darrell
's
open
features
,
frankness
and
honour
were
written
in
legible
characters
;
while
,
in
Jack
's
physiognomy
,
cunning
and
knavery
were
as
strongly
imprinted
.
<EOS>
In
all
other
respects
they
differed
as
materially
.
<EOS>
Jack
could
hardly
be
accounted
good
-
looking
:
<EOS>
Thames
,
on
the
contrary
,
was
one
of
the
handsomest
boys
possible
.
<EOS>
Jack
's
complexion
was
that
of
a
gipsy
;
Darrell
's
as
fresh
and
bright
as
a
rose
.
<EOS>
Jack
's
mouth
was
coarse
and
large
;
Darrell
's
small
and
exquisitely
carved
,
with
the
short
,
proud
upper
lip
,
which
belongs
to
the
highest
order
of
beauty
.
<EOS>
Jack
's
nose
was
broad
and
flat
;
<EOS>
Darrell
's
straight
and
fine
as
that
of
Antinous
.
<EOS>
The
expression
pervading
the
countenance
of
the
one
was
vulgarity
;
of
the
other
,
that
which
is
rarely
found
,
except
in
persons
of
high
birth
.
<EOS>
Darrell
's
eyes
were
of
that
clear
gray
which
it
is
difficult
to
distinguish
from
blue
by
day
and
black
at
night
;
and
his
rich
brown
hair
,
which
he
could
not
consent
to
part
with
,
even
on
the
promise
of
a
new
and
modish
peruke
from
his
adoptive
father
,
fell
in
thick
glossy
ringlets
upon
his
shoulders
;
whereas
Jack
's
close
black
crop
imparted
the
peculiar
bullet
-
shape
we
have
noticed
,
to
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
While
Thames
modestly
expressed
a
hope
that
he
might
not
belie
the
carpenter
's
favourable
prediction
,
Jack
Sheppard
thought
fit
to
mount
a
small
ladder
placed
against
the
wall
,
and
,
springing
with
the
agility
of
an
ape
upon
a
sort
of
frame
,
contrived
to
sustain
short
spars
and
blocks
of
timber
,
began
to
search
about
for
a
piece
of
wood
required
in
the
work
on
which
he
was
engaged
.
<EOS>
Being
in
a
great
hurry
,
he
took
little
heed
where
he
set
his
feet
;
and
a
board
giving
way
,
he
must
have
fallen
,
if
he
had
not
grasped
a
large
plank
laid
upon
the
transverse
beam
immediately
over
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
care
,
Jack
,
"
shouted
Thames
,
who
witnessed
the
occurrence
;
"
that
plank
is
n't
properly
balanced
.
<EOS>
You
'll
have
it
down
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
the
caution
came
too
late
.
<EOS>
Sheppard
's
weight
had
destroyed
the
equilibrium
of
the
plank
:
it
swerved
,
and
slowly
descended
.
<EOS>
Losing
his
presence
of
mind
,
Jack
quitted
his
hold
,
and
dropped
upon
the
frame
.
<EOS>
The
plank
hung
over
his
head
.
<EOS>
A
moment
more
<EOS>
and
he
would
have
been
crushed
beneath
the
ponderous
board
,
when
a
slight
but
strong
arm
arrested
its
descent
.
 
<EOS>
"
Get
from
under
it
,
Jack
!
"
<EOS>
vociferated
Thames
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
hold
it
much
longer
--
<EOS>
it'll
break
my
wrist
.
<EOS>
Down
we
come
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
letting
go
the
plank
,
which
fell
with
a
crash
,
and
leaping
after
Sheppard
,
who
had
rolled
off
the
frame
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
was
the
work
of
a
minute
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
bones
broken
,
I
hope
,
"
said
Thames
,
laughing
at
Jack
,
who
limped
towards
the
bench
,
rubbing
his
shins
as
he
went
.
 
<EOS>
"
All
right
,
"
replied
Sheppard
,
with
affected
indifference
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
mercy
you
both
escaped
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Wood
,
only
just
finding
his
tongue
.
<EOS>
"
I
declare
I
'm
all
in
a
cold
sweat
.
<EOS>
How
came
you
,
Sir
,
"
he
continued
,
addressing
Sheppard
,
"
to
venture
upon
that
frame
.
<EOS>
I
always
told
you
some
accident
would
happen
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
scold
him
,
father
,
"
interposed
Thames
;
"
he
's
been
frightened
enough
already
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
since
you
desire
it
,
I
'll
say
no
more
,
"
returned
Wood
.
<EOS>
"
You
hay'n't
hurt
your
arm
,
I
trust
,
my
dear
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
anxiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Only
sprained
it
a
little
,
that
's
all
,
"
answered
Thames
;
"
the
pain
will
go
off
presently
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
_
are
_
hurt
,
"
cried
the
carpenter
in
alarm
.
<EOS>
"
Come
down
stairs
directly
,
and
let
your
mother
look
at
your
wrist
.
<EOS>
She
has
an
excellent
remedy
for
a
sprain
.
<EOS>
And
do
you
,
Jack
,
attend
to
your
work
,
and
mind
you
do
n't
get
into
further
mischief
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Had
n't
Jack
better
go
with
us
?
"
said
Thames
.
<EOS>
"
His
shin
may
need
rubbing
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
By
no
means
,
"
rejoined
Wood
,
hastily
.
<EOS>
"
A
little
suffering
will
do
him
good
.
<EOS>
I
meant
to
give
him
a
drubbing
.
<EOS>
That
bruise
will
answer
the
same
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Thames
,
"
said
Sheppard
in
a
low
voice
,
as
he
threw
a
vindictive
glance
at
the
carpenter
,
"
I
sha
n't
forget
this
.
<EOS>
You
've
saved
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pshaw
!
<EOS>
you
'd
do
as
much
for
me
any
day
,
and
think
no
more
about
it
.
<EOS>
It
'll
be
your
turn
to
save
mine
next
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
True
,
and
I
sha
n't
be
easy
till
my
turn
arrives
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
<EOS>
what
,
Jack
,
"
whispered
Thames
,
who
had
noticed
Sheppard
's
menacing
glance
,
and
dreaded
some
further
indiscretion
on
his
part
,
"
if
you
really
wish
to
oblige
me
,
you
'll
get
that
packing
-
case
finished
by
six
o'clock
.
<EOS>
You
_
can
_
do
it
,
if
you
will
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
_
will
_
,
if
I
can
,
depend
upon
it
,
"
answered
Sheppard
,
with
a
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
manfully
resumed
his
work
;
while
Wood
and
Thames
quitted
the
room
,
and
went
down
stairs
.
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
II
.
 
<EOS>
Thames
Darrell
.
  
<EOS>
Thames
Darrell
's
arm
having
been
submitted
to
the
scrutiny
of
Mrs.
Wood
,
was
pronounced
by
that
lady
to
be
very
much
sprained
;
and
she
,
forthwith
,
proceeded
to
bathe
it
with
a
reddish
-
coloured
lotion
.
<EOS>
During
this
operation
,
the
carpenter
underwent
a
severe
catechism
as
to
the
cause
of
the
accident
;
and
,
on
learning
that
the
mischance
originated
with
Jack
Sheppard
,
the
indignation
of
his
helpmate
knew
no
bounds
;
and
she
was
with
difficulty
prevented
from
flying
to
the
workshop
to
inflict
summary
punishment
on
the
offender
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
knew
how
it
would
be
,
"
she
cried
,
in
the
shrill
voice
peculiar
to
a
shrew
,
"
when
you
brought
that
worthless
hussy
's
worthless
brat
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
told
you
no
good
would
come
of
it
.
<EOS>
And
every
day
's
experience
proves
that
I
was
right
.
<EOS>
But
,
like
all
your
overbearing
sex
,
you
must
have
your
own
way
.
<EOS>
You
'll
never
be
guided
by
me
--
never
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
my
love
,
you
're
entirely
mistaken
,
"
returned
the
carpenter
,
endeavouring
to
deprecate
his
wife
's
rising
resentment
by
the
softest
looks
,
and
the
meekest
deportment
.
 
<EOS>
So
far
,
however
,
was
this
submission
from
producing
the
desired
effect
,
that
it
seemed
only
to
lend
additional
fuel
to
her
displeasure
.
<EOS>
Forgetting
her
occupation
in
her
anger
,
she
left
off
bathing
Darrell
's
wrist
;
and
,
squeezing
his
arm
so
tightly
that
the
boy
winced
with
pain
,
she
clapped
her
right
hand
upon
her
hip
,
and
turned
,
with
flashing
eyes
and
an
inflamed
countenance
,
towards
her
crest
-
fallen
spouse
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
almost
choked
with
passion,--"_I
_
<EOS>
advised
you
to
burthen
yourself
with
that
idle
and
good
-
for
-
nothing
pauper
,
who'm
you
ought
rather
to
send
to
the
workhouse
than
maintain
at
your
own
expense
,
did
I
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
_
advised
you
to
take
him
as
an
apprentice
;
and
,
so
far
from
getting
the
regular
fee
with
him
,
to
give
him
a
salary
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
_
advised
you
to
feed
him
,
and
clothe
him
,
and
treat
him
like
his
betters
;
to
put
up
with
his
insolence
,
and
wink
at
his
faults
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
_
counselled
all
this
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
You
'll
tell
me
next
,
I
dare
say
,
that
I
recommended
you
to
go
and
visit
his
mother
so
frequently
under
the
plea
of
charity
;
to
give
her
wine
,
and
provisions
,
and
money
;
to
remove
her
from
the
only
fit
quarters
for
such
people
--
the
Mint
;
and
to
place
her
in
a
cottage
at
Willesden
,
of
which
you
must
needs
pay
the
rent
?
<EOS>
Marry
,
come
up
!
<EOS>
charity
should
begin
at
home
.
<EOS>
A
discreet
husband
would
leave
the
dispensation
of
his
bounty
,
where
women
are
concerned
,
to
his
wife
.
<EOS>
And
for
my
part
,
if
I
were
inclined
to
exercise
my
benevolence
at
all
,
it
should
be
in
favour
of
some
more
deserving
object
than
that
whining
,
hypocritical
Magdalene
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
the
knowledge
of
this
feeling
on
your
part
,
my
love
,
that
made
me
act
without
your
express
sanction
.
<EOS>
I
did
all
for
the
best
,
I
'm
sure
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Sheppard
is--
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
Mrs.
Sheppard
is
,
without
your
information
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
I
have
n't
forgotten
her
previous
history
.
<EOS>
You
've
your
own
reasons
,
no
doubt
,
for
bringing
up
her
son
--
perhaps
,
I
ought
rather
to
say
_
your
_
son
,
Mr.
Wood
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Really
,
my
love
,
these
accusations
are
most
groundless
--
this
violence
is
most
unnecessary
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
endure
the
odious
baggage
.
<EOS>
I
hope
I
may
never
come
near
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
never
may
,
my
love
,
"
humbly
acquiesced
the
carpenter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
my
house
to
be
made
a
receptacle
for
all
your
natural
children
,
Sir
?
<EOS>
Answer
me
that
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Winny
,
"
said
Thames
,
whose
glowing
cheek
attested
the
effect
produced
upon
him
by
the
insinuation
;
<EOS>
"
Winny
,
"
said
he
,
addressing
a
pretty
little
damsel
of
some
twelve
years
of
age
,
who
stood
by
his
side
holding
the
bottle
of
embrocation
,
"
help
me
on
with
my
coat
,
please
.
<EOS>
This
is
no
place
for
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
,
my
dear
,
sit
down
,
"
interposed
Mrs.
Wood
,
softening
her
asperity
.
<EOS>
"
What
I
said
about
natural
children
does
n't
apply
to
_
you
_
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
suppose
,
"
she
added
,
with
a
scornful
glance
at
her
helpmate
,
"
that
I
would
pay
him
the
compliment
of
thinking
he
could
possibly
be
the
father
of
such
a
boy
as
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Wood
lifted
up
his
hands
in
mute
despair
.
 
<EOS>
"
Owen
,
Owen
,
"
pursued
Mrs.
Wood
,
sinking
into
a
chair
,
and
fanning
herself
<EOS>
violently,--"what
<EOS>
a
fluster
you
have
put
me
into
with
your
violence
,
to
be
sure
!
<EOS>
And
at
the
very
time
,
too
,
when
you
know
I
'm
expecting
a
visit
from
Mr.
Kneebone
,
on
his
return
from
Manchester
.
<EOS>
I
would
n't
have
him
see
me
in
this
state
for
the
world
.
<EOS>
He
'd
never
forgive
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Poh
,
poh
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Kneebone
invariably
takes
part
with
me
,
when
any
trifling
misunderstanding
arises
between
us
.
<EOS>
I
only
wish
he
was
not
a
Papist
and
a
Jacobite
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Jacobite
!
"
echoed
Mrs.
Wood
.
<EOS>
"
Marry
,
come
up
!
<EOS>
Might
n't
he
just
as
reasonably
complain
of
your
being
a
Hanoverian
and
a
Presbyterian
?
<EOS>
It
's
all
matter
of
opinion
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
my
love
,
"
she
added
,
with
a
relenting
look
,
"
I
'm
content
to
make
up
our
quarrel
.
<EOS>
But
you
must
promise
me
not
to
go
near
that
abandoned
hussy
at
Willesden
.
<EOS>
One
ca
n't
help
being
jealous
,
you
know
,
even
of
an
unworthy
object
.
"
 
<EOS>
Glad
to
make
peace
on
any
terms
,
Mr.
Wood
gave
the
required
promise
,
though
he
could
not
help
thinking
that
if
either
of
them
had
cause
to
be
jealous
<EOS>
he
was
the
party
.
 
<EOS>
And
here
,
we
may
be
permitted
to
offer
an
observation
upon
the
peculiar
and
unaccountable
influence
which
ladies
of
a
shrewish
turn
so
frequently
exercise
over
--
we
can
scarcely
,
in
this
case
,
say
--
their
lords
and
masters
;
an
influence
which
seems
not
merely
to
extend
to
the
will
of
the
husband
,
but
even
to
his
inclinations
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
remember
to
have
met
with
a
single
individual
,
reported
to
be
under
petticoat
government
,
who
was
not
content
with
his
lot,--nay
,
who
so
far
from
repining
,
did
not
exult
in
his
servitude
;
and
we
see
no
way
of
accounting
for
this
apparently
inexplicable
conduct
--
for
which
,
among
other
phenomena
of
married
life
,
various
reasons
have
been
assigned
,
though
none
entirely
satisfactory
to
us
--
except
upon
the
ground
that
these
domineering
dames
possess
some
charm
sufficiently
strong
to
counteract
the
irritating
effect
of
their
tempers
;
some
secret
and
attractive
quality
of
which
the
world
at
large
is
in
ignorance
,
and
with
which
their
husbands
alone
can
be
supposed
to
be
acquainted
.
<EOS>
An
influence
of
this
description
appeared
to
be
exerted
on
the
present
occasion
.
<EOS>
The
worthy
carpenter
was
restored
to
instant
good
humour
by
a
glance
from
his
helpmate
;
and
,
notwithstanding
the
infliction
he
had
just
endured
,
he
would
have
quarrelled
with
any
one
who
had
endeavoured
to
persuade
him
that
he
was
not
the
happiest
of
men
,
and
Mrs.
Wood
the
best
of
wives
.
 
<EOS>
"
Women
must
have
their
wills
while
they
live
,
since
they
can
make
none
when
they
die
,
"
observed
Wood
,
as
he
imprinted
a
kiss
of
reconciliation
on
the
plump
hand
of
his
consort;--a
sentiment
to
the
correctness
of
which
the
party
chiefly
interested
graciously
vouchsafed
her
assent
.
 
<EOS>
Lest
the
carpenter
should
be
taxed
with
too
much
uxoriousness
,
it
behoves
us
to
ascertain
whether
the
personal
attractions
of
his
helpmate
would
,
in
any
degree
,
justify
the
devotion
he
displayed
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
Mrs.
Wood
had
the
advantage
of
her
husband
in
point
of
years
,
being
on
the
sunny
side
of
forty,--a
period
pronounced
by
competent
judges
to
be
the
most
fascinating
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
most
critical
epoch
of
woman
's
existence,--whereas
,
he
was
on
the
shady
side
of
fifty,--a
term
of
life
not
generally
conceived
to
have
any
special
recommendation
in
female
eyes
.
<EOS>
In
the
next
place
,
she
really
had
some
pretensions
to
beauty
.
<EOS>
Accounted
extremely
pretty
in
her
youth
,
her
features
and
person
expanded
as
she
grew
older
,
without
much
detriment
to
their
original
comeliness
.
<EOS>
Hers
was
beauty
on
a
large
scale
no
doubt
;
but
it
was
beauty
,
nevertheless
:
and
the
carpenter
thought
her
eyes
as
bright
,
her
complexion
as
blooming
,
and
her
figure
(
if
a
little
more
buxom
)
quite
as
captivating
as
when
he
led
her
to
the
altar
some
twenty
years
ago
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
present
occasion
,
in
anticipation
of
Mr.
Kneebone
's
visit
,
Mrs.
Wood
was
dressed
with
more
than
ordinary
care
,
and
in
more
than
ordinary
finery
.
<EOS>
A
dove
-
coloured
kincob
gown
,
embroidered
with
large
trees
,
and
made
very
low
in
front
,
displayed
to
the
greatest
possible
advantage
,
the
rounded
proportions
of
her
figure
;
while
a
high
-
heeled
,
red
-
leather
shoe
did
not
detract
from
the
symmetry
of
a
very
neat
ankle
,
and
a
very
small
foot
.
<EOS>
A
stomacher
,
fastened
by
imitation
-
diamond
buckles
,
girded
that
part
of
her
person
,
which
should
have
been
a
waist
;
a
coral
necklace
encircled
her
throat
,
and
a
few
black
patches
,
or
mouches
,
as
they
were
termed
,
served
as
a
foil
to
the
bloom
of
her
cheek
and
chin
.
<EOS>
Upon
a
table
,
where
they
had
been
hastily
deposited
,
on
the
intelligence
of
Darrell
's
accident
,
lay
a
pair
of
pink
kid
gloves
,
bordered
with
lace
,
and
an
enormous
fan
;
the
latter
,
when
opened
,
represented
the
metamorphosis
and
death
of
Actæon
.
<EOS>
From
her
stomacher
,
to
which
it
was
attached
by
a
multitude
of
glittering
steel
chains
,
depended
an
immense
turnip
-
shaped
watch
,
in
a
pinchbeck
case
.
<EOS>
Her
hair
was
gathered
up
behind
,
in
a
sort
of
pad
,
according
to
the
then
prevailing
mode
;
and
she
wore
a
muslin
cap
,
and
pinners
with
crow
-
foot
edging
.
<EOS>
A
black
silk
fur
-
belowed
scarf
covered
her
shoulders
;
and
over
the
kincob
gown
hung
a
yellow
satin
apron
,
trimmed
with
white
Persian
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
in
spite
of
her
attractions
,
we
shall
address
ourselves
to
the
younger
,
and
more
interesting
couple
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
almost
find
in
my
heart
to
quarrel
with
Jack
Sheppard
for
occasioning
you
so
much
pain
,
"
observed
little
Winifred
Wood
,
as
,
having
completed
her
ministration
to
the
best
of
her
ability
,
she
helped
Thames
on
with
his
coat
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
you
could
find
in
your
heart
to
quarrel
with
any
one
,
Winny
;
much
less
with
a
person
whom
I
like
so
much
as
Jack
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
My
arm
's
nearly
well
again
.
<EOS>
And
I
've
already
told
you
the
accident
was
not
Jack
's
fault
.
<EOS>
So
,
let
's
think
no
more
about
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
strange
<EOS>
you
should
like
Jack
so
much
dear
Thames
.
<EOS>
He
does
n't
resemble
you
at
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
very
reason
why
I
like
him
,
Winny
.
<EOS>
If
he
_
did
_
resemble
me
,
I
should
n't
care
about
him
.
<EOS>
And
,
whatever
you
may
think
,
I
assure
you
,
Jack
's
a
downright
good
-
natured
fellow
.
"
 
<EOS>
Good
-
natured
fellows
are
always
especial
favourites
with
boys
.
<EOS>
And
,
in
applying
the
term
to
his
friend
,
Thames
meant
to
pay
him
a
high
compliment
.
<EOS>
And
so
Winifred
understood
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
she
said
,
in
reply
,
"
I
may
have
done
Jack
an
injustice
.
<EOS>
I
'll
try
to
think
better
of
him
in
future
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
,
if
you
want
an
additional
inducement
to
do
so
,
I
can
tell
you
there
's
no
one
--
not
even
his
mother
--
whom
he
loves
so
well
as
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Loves
!
"
echoed
<EOS>
Winifred
,
slightly
colouring
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
loves
,
Winny
.
<EOS>
Poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
he
sometimes
indulges
the
hope
of
marrying
you
,
when
he
grows
old
enough
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Thames
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Have
I
said
anything
to
offend
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
no
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
would
n't
have
me
positively
dislike
Jack
Sheppard
,
you
'll
never
mention
such
a
subject
again
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
"
she
added
,
blushing
yet
more
deeply
,
"
it
is
n't
a
proper
one
to
talk
upon
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
then
,
to
change
it
,
"
replied
Thames
,
gravely
<EOS>
,
"
suppose
I
should
be
obliged
to
leave
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
Winifred
looked
as
if
she
could
not
indulge
such
a
supposition
for
a
single
moment
.
 
<EOS>
"
Surely
,
"
she
said
,
after
a
pause
,
"
you
do
n't
attach
any
importance
to
what
my
mother
has
just
said
.
<EOS>
_
She
_
has
already
forgotten
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
_
I
_
never
can
forget
it
,
Winny
.
<EOS>
I
will
no
longer
be
a
burthen
to
those
upon
whom
I
have
no
claim
,
but
compassion
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
said
this
,
in
a
low
and
mournful
,
but
firm
voice
,
the
tears
gathered
thickly
in
Winifred
's
dark
eyelashes
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
in
earnest
,
Thames
,
"
she
replied
,
with
a
look
of
gentle
reproach
,
"
you
are
very
foolish
;
and
,
if
in
jest
,
very
cruel
.
<EOS>
My
mother
,
I
'm
sure
,
did
n't
intend
to
hurt
your
feelings
.
<EOS>
She
loves
you
too
well
for
that
.
<EOS>
And
I
'll
answer
for
it
,
she
'll
never
say
a
syllable
to
annoy
you
again
.
"
 
<EOS>
Thames
tried
to
answer
her
,
but
his
voice
failed
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
!
<EOS>
I
see
the
storm
has
blown
over
,
"
cried
Winifred
,
brightening
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
mistaken
,
Winny
.
<EOS>
Nothing
can
alter
my
determination
.
<EOS>
I
shall
quit
this
roof
to
-
morrow
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
little
girl
's
countenance
fell
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
nothing
without
consulting
my
father--_your
_
father
,
Thames
,
"
she
implored
.
<EOS>
"
Promise
me
that
.
"
 
"
<EOS>
Willingly
.
<EOS>
And
what
's
more
,
I
promise
to
abide
by
his
decision
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
,
I
'm
quite
easy
,
"
cried
Winifred
,
joyfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
he
wo
n't
attempt
to
prevent
me
,
"
rejoined
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
The
slight
smile
that
played
upon
Winifred
's
lips
seemed
to
say
that
_
she
_
was
not
quite
so
sure
.
<EOS>
But
she
made
no
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
case
he
should
consent--
"
 
"
He
never
will
,
"
interrupted
Winifred
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
case
he
_
should
_
,
I
say
,
"
continued
Thames
,
"
will
_
you
_
promise
to
let
Jack
Sheppard
take
my
place
in
your
affections
,
Winny
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
!
"
replied
the
little
damsel
,
"
I
can
never
love
any
one
so
much
as
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Excepting
your
father
.
"
 
<EOS>
Winifred
was
going
to
say
"
No
,
"
but
she
checked
herself
;
and
,
with
cheeks
mantling
with
blushes
,
murmured
,
"
I
wish
you
would
n't
tease
me
about
Jack
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
foregoing
conversation
,
having
been
conducted
throughout
in
a
low
tone
,
and
apart
,
had
not
reached
the
ears
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Wood
,
who
were
,
furthermore
,
engaged
in
a
little
conjugal
_
tête
-
à
-
tête
_
of
their
own
.
<EOS>
The
last
observation
,
however
,
caught
the
attention
of
the
carpenter
's
wife
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
you
're
saying
about
Jack
Sheppard
?
<EOS>
"
she
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thames
was
just
observing--
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Thames
!
"
echoed
Mrs.
Wood
,
glancing
angrily
at
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
another
instance
of
your
wilfulness
and
want
of
taste
.
<EOS>
Who
but
_
<EOS>
you
_
would
have
dreamed
of
giving
the
boy
such
a
name
?
<EOS>
Why
,
it
's
the
name
of
a
river
,
not
a
Christian
.
<EOS>
No
gentleman
was
ever
called
Thames
,
and
Darrell
_
is
_
a
gentleman
,
unless
the
whole
story
of
his
being
found
in
the
river
is
a
fabrication
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
you
forget--
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
Mr.
Wood
,
I
forget
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
've
an
excellent
memory
,
thank
God
!
<EOS>
And
I
perfectly
remember
that
everybody
was
drowned
upon
that
occasion
--
except
yourself
and
the
child
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
love
you
're
beside
yourself--
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
beside
myself
to
take
charge
of
your--
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mother
?
<EOS>
"
interposed
Winifred
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
of
no
use
,
"
observed
Thames
quietly
,
but
with
a
look
that
chilled
the
little
damsel
's
heart;--"my
resolution
is
taken
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
at
least
appear
to
forget
that
Mr.
Kneebone
is
coming
,
my
dear
,
"
ventured
Mr.
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
gracious
!
<EOS>
so
I
do
,
"
exclaimed
his
amiable
consort
.
"
<EOS>
But
you
_
do
<EOS>
_
agitate
me
so
much
.
<EOS>
Come
into
the
parlour
,
Winifred
,
and
dry
your
eyes
directly
,
or
I
'll
send
you
to
bed
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wood
,
I
desire
you
'll
put
on
your
best
things
,
and
join
us
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
Thames
,
you
need
n't
tidy
yourself
,
as
you
've
hurt
your
arm
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kneebone
will
excuse
you
.
<EOS>
Dear
me
!
<EOS>
if
there
is
n't
his
knock
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
'm
in
such
a
fluster
!
"
 
<EOS>
Upon
which
,
she
snatched
up
her
fan
,
cast
a
look
into
the
glass
,
smoothed
down
her
scarf
,
threw
a
soft
expression
into
her
features
,
and
led
the
way
into
the
next
room
,
whither
she
was
followed
by
her
daughter
and
Thames
Darrell
.

CHAPTER
III
.
 
<EOS>
The
Jacobite
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
William
Kneebone
was
a
woollen
-
draper
of
"
credit
and
renown
,
"
whose
place
of
business
was
held
at
the
sign
of
the
Angel
(
for
,
in
those
days
,
every
shop
had
its
sign
)
,
opposite
Saint
Clement
's
church
in
the
Strand
.
<EOS>
A
native
of
Manchester
,
he
was
the
son
of
Kenelm
Kneebone
,
a
staunch
Catholic
,
and
a
sergeant
of
dragoons
,
who
lost
his
legs
and
his
life
while
fighting
for
James
the
Second
at
the
battle
of
the
Boyne
,
and
who
had
little
to
bequeath
his
son
except
his
laurels
and
his
loyalty
to
the
house
of
Stuart
.
 
<EOS>
The
gallant
woollen
-
draper
was
now
in
his
thirty
-
sixth
year
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
handsome
,
jolly
-
looking
face
;
stood
six
feet
two
in
his
stockings
;
and
measured
more
than
a
cloth
-
yard
shaft
across
the
shoulders
--
athletic
proportions
derived
from
his
father
the
dragoon
.
<EOS>
And
,
if
it
had
not
been
for
a
taste
for
plotting
,
which
was
continually
getting
him
into
scrapes
,
he
might
have
been
accounted
a
respectable
member
of
society
.
 
<EOS>
Of
late
,
however
,
his
plotting
had
assumed
a
more
dark
and
dangerous
complexion
.
<EOS>
The
times
were
such
that
,
with
the
opinions
he
entertained
,
he
could
not
remain
idle
.
<EOS>
The
spirit
of
disaffection
was
busy
throughout
the
kingdom
.
<EOS>
It
was
on
the
eve
of
that
memorable
rebellion
which
broke
forth
,
two
months
later
,
in
Scotland
.
<EOS>
Since
the
accession
of
George
the
First
to
the
throne
in
the
preceding
year
,
every
effort
had
been
made
by
the
partisans
of
the
Stuarts
to
shake
the
credit
of
the
existing
government
,
and
to
gain
supporters
to
their
cause
.
<EOS>
Disappointed
in
their
hopes
of
the
restoration
of
the
fallen
dynasty
after
the
death
of
Anne
,
the
adherents
of
the
Chevalier
de
Saint
George
endeavoured
,
by
sowing
the
seeds
of
dissension
far
and
wide
,
to
produce
a
general
insurrection
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
No
means
were
neglected
to
accomplish
this
end
.
<EOS>
Agents
were
dispersed
in
all
directions
--
offers
the
most
tempting
held
out
to
induce
the
wavering
to
join
the
Chevalier
's
standard
.
<EOS>
Plots
were
hatched
in
the
provinces
,
where
many
of
the
old
and
wealthy
Catholic
families
resided
,
whose
zeal
for
the
martyr
of
their
religion
(
as
the
Chevalier
was
esteemed
)
,
sharpened
by
the
persecutions
they
themselves
endured
,
rendered
them
hearty
and
efficient
allies
.
<EOS>
Arms
,
horses
,
and
accoutrements
were
secretly
purchased
and
distributed
;
and
it
is
not
improbable
that
,
if
the
unfortunate
prince
,
in
whose
behalf
these
exertions
were
made
,
and
who
was
not
deficient
in
courage
,
as
he
proved
at
the
battle
of
Malplaquet
,
had
boldly
placed
himself
at
the
head
of
his
party
at
an
earlier
period
,
he
might
have
regained
the
crown
of
his
ancestors
.
<EOS>
But
the
indecision
,
which
had
been
fatal
to
his
race
,
was
fatal
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
delayed
the
blow
till
the
fortunate
conjuncture
was
past
.
<EOS>
And
when
,
at
length
,
it
_
was
_
struck
,
he
wanted
energy
to
pursue
his
advantages
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
must
not
anticipate
the
course
of
events
.
<EOS>
At
the
precise
period
of
this
history
,
the
Jacobite
party
was
full
of
hope
and
confidence
.
<EOS>
Louis
the
Fourteenth
yet
lived
,
and
expectations
were
,
therefore
,
indulged
of
assistance
from
France
.
<EOS>
The
disgrace
of
the
leaders
of
the
late
Tory
administration
had
strengthened
,
rather
than
injured
,
their
cause
.
<EOS>
Mobs
were
gathered
together
on
the
slightest
possible
pretext
;
and
these
tumultuous
assemblages
,
while
committing
the
most
outrageous
excesses
,
loudly
proclaimed
their
hatred
to
the
house
of
Hanover
,
and
their
determination
to
cut
off
the
Protestant
succession
.
<EOS>
The
proceedings
of
this
faction
were
narrowly
watched
by
a
vigilant
and
sagacious
administration
.
<EOS>
The
government
was
not
deceived
(
indeed
,
every
opportunity
was
sought
by
the
Jacobites
of
parading
their
numbers
,
)
as
to
the
force
of
its
enemies
;
and
precautionary
measures
were
taken
to
defeat
their
designs
.
<EOS>
On
the
very
day
of
which
we
write
,
namely
,
the
10th
of
June
1715
,
Bolingbroke
and
Oxford
were
impeached
of
high
treason
.
<EOS>
The
Committee
of
Secrecy
--
that
English
Council
of
Ten
--
were
sitting
,
with
Walpole
at
their
head
;
and
the
most
extraordinary
discoveries
were
reported
to
be
made
.
<EOS>
On
the
same
day
,
moreover
,
which
,
by
a
curious
coincidence
,
was
the
birthday
of
the
Chevalier
de
Saint
George
,
mobs
were
collected
together
in
the
streets
,
and
the
health
of
that
prince
was
publicly
drunk
under
the
title
of
James
the
Third
;
while
,
in
many
country
towns
,
the
bells
were
rung
,
and
rejoicings
held
,
as
if
for
a
reigning
monarch:--the
cry
of
the
populace
almost
universally
being
,
"
No
King
George
,
but
a
Stuart
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
adherents
of
the
Chevalier
de
Saint
George
,
we
have
said
,
were
lavish
in
promises
to
their
proselytes
.
<EOS>
Posts
were
offered
to
all
who
chose
to
accept
them
.
<EOS>
Blank
commissions
,
signed
by
the
prince
,
to
be
filled
up
by
the
name
of
the
person
,
who
could
raise
a
troop
for
his
service
,
were
liberally
bestowed
.
<EOS>
Amongst
others
,
Mr.
Kneebone
,
whose
interest
was
not
inconsiderable
with
the
leaders
of
his
faction
,
obtained
an
appointment
as
captain
in
a
regiment
of
infantry
,
on
the
conditions
above
specified
.
<EOS>
With
a
view
to
raise
recruits
for
his
corps
,
the
warlike
woollen
-
draper
started
for
Lancashire
,
under
the
colour
of
a
journey
on
business
.
<EOS>
He
was
pretty
successful
in
Manchester,--a
town
which
may
be
said
to
have
been
the
head
-
quarters
of
the
disaffected
.
<EOS>
On
his
return
to
London
,
he
found
that
applications
had
been
made
from
a
somewhat
doubtful
quarter
by
two
individuals
,
for
the
posts
of
subordinate
officers
in
his
troop
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kneebone
,
or
,
as
he
would
have
preferred
being
styled
,
Captain
Kneebone
,
was
not
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
recommendations
forwarded
by
the
applicants
.
<EOS>
But
this
was
not
a
season
in
which
to
be
needlessly
scrupulous
.
<EOS>
He
resolved
to
judge
for
himself
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
he
was
introduced
to
the
two
military
aspirants
at
the
Cross
Shovels
in
the
Mint
,
by
our
old
acquaintance
,
Baptist
Kettleby
.
<EOS>
The
Master
of
the
Mint
,
with
whom
the
Jacobite
captain
had
often
had
transactions
before
,
vouched
for
their
being
men
of
honour
and
loyalty
;
and
Kneebone
was
so
well
satisfied
with
his
representations
,
that
he
at
once
closed
the
matter
by
administering
to
the
applicants
the
oath
of
allegiance
and
fidelity
to
King
James
the
Third
,
and
several
other
oaths
besides
,
all
of
which
those
gentlemen
took
with
as
little
hesitation
as
the
sum
of
money
,
afterwards
tendered
,
to
make
the
compact
binding
.
<EOS>
The
party
,
then
,
sat
down
to
a
bowl
of
punch
;
and
,
at
its
conclusion
,
Captain
Kneebone
regretted
that
an
engagement
to
spend
the
evening
with
Mrs.
Wood
,
would
preclude
the
possibility
of
his
remaining
with
his
new
friends
as
long
as
his
inclinations
prompted
.
<EOS>
At
this
piece
of
information
,
the
two
subordinate
officers
were
observed
to
exchange
glances
;
and
,
after
a
little
agreeable
raillery
on
their
captain
's
gallantry
,
they
begged
permission
to
accompany
him
in
his
visit
.
<EOS>
Kneebone
,
who
had
drained
his
glass
to
the
restoration
of
the
house
of
Stuart
,
and
the
downfall
of
the
house
of
Hanover
,
more
frequently
than
was
consistent
with
prudence
,
consented
;
and
the
trio
set
out
for
Wych
Street
,
where
they
arrived
in
the
jolliest
humour
possible
.
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IV
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Kneebone
and
his
Friends
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wood
was
scarcely
seated
before
Mr.
Kneebone
made
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
To
her
great
surprise
and
mortification
he
was
not
alone
;
but
brought
with
him
a
couple
of
friends
,
whom
he
begged
to
introduce
as
Mr.
Jeremiah
Jackson
,
and
Mr.
Solomon
Smith
,
chapmen
,
(
or
what
in
modern
vulgar
parlance
would
be
termed
bagmen
)
travelling
to
procure
orders
for
the
house
of
an
eminent
cloth
manufacturer
in
Manchester
.
<EOS>
Neither
the
manners
,
the
looks
,
nor
the
attire
of
these
gentlemen
prepossessed
Mrs.
Wood
in
their
favour
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
on
their
presentation
,
Mr.
Jeremiah
Jackson
and
Mr.
Solomon
Smith
received
something
very
like
a
rebuff
.
<EOS>
Luckily
,
they
were
not
easily
discomposed
.
<EOS>
Two
persons
possessing
a
more
comfortable
stock
of
assurance
could
not
be
readily
found
.
<EOS>
Imitating
the
example
of
Mr.
Kneebone
,
who
did
not
appear
in
the
slightest
degree
disconcerted
by
his
cool
reception
,
each
sank
carelessly
into
a
chair
,
and
made
himself
at
home
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Both
had
very
singular
faces
;
very
odd
wigs
,
very
much
pulled
over
their
brows
;
and
very
large
cravats
,
very
much
raised
above
their
chins
.
<EOS>
Besides
this
,
each
had
a
large
black
patch
over
his
right
eye
,
and
a
very
queer
twist
at
the
left
side
of
his
mouth
,
so
that
if
their
object
had
been
disguise
,
they
could
not
have
adopted
better
precautions
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wood
thought
them
both
remarkably
plain
,
but
Mr.
Smith
decidedly
the
plainest
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
His
complexion
was
as
blue
as
a
sailor
's
jacket
,
and
though
Mr.
Jackson
had
one
of
the
ugliest
countenances
imaginable
,
he
had
a
very
fine
set
of
teeth
.
<EOS>
That
was
something
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
One
peculiarity
she
did
not
fail
to
notice
.
<EOS>
They
were
both
dressed
in
every
respect
alike
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
Mr.
Solomon
Smith
seemed
to
be
Mr.
Jeremiah
Jackson
's
double
.
<EOS>
He
talked
in
the
same
style
,
and
pretty
nearly
in
the
same
language
;
laughed
in
the
same
manner
,
and
coughed
,
or
sneezed
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
If
Mr.
Jackson
took
an
accurate
survey
of
the
room
with
his
one
eye
,
Mr.
Smith
's
solitary
orb
followed
in
the
same
direction
.
<EOS>
When
Jeremiah
admired
the
Compasses
in
the
arms
of
the
Carpenter
's
Company
over
the
chimney
-
piece
,
or
the
portraits
of
the
two
eminent
masters
of
the
rule
and
plane
,
William
Portington
,
and
John
Scott
,
Esquires
,
on
either
side
of
it
,
Solomon
was
lost
in
wonder
.
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Jackson
noticed
a
fine
service
of
old
blue
china
in
an
open
japan
closet
,
Mr.
Smith
had
never
seen
anything
like
it
.
<EOS>
And
finally
,
when
Jeremiah
,
having
bestowed
upon
Mrs.
Wood
a
very
free
-
and
-
easy
sort
of
stare
,
winked
at
Mr.
Kneebone
,
his
impertinence
was
copied
to
the
letter
by
Solomon
.
<EOS>
All
three
,
then
,
burst
into
an
immoderate
fit
of
laughter
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wood
's
astonishment
and
displeasure
momentarily
increased
.
<EOS>
Such
freedoms
from
such
people
were
not
to
be
endured
.
<EOS>
Her
patience
was
waning
fast
.
<EOS>
Still
,
in
spite
of
her
glances
and
gestures
,
Mr.
Kneebone
made
no
effort
to
check
the
unreasonable
merriment
of
his
companions
,
but
rather
seemed
to
encourage
it
.
<EOS>
So
Mrs.
Wood
went
on
fuming
,
and
the
trio
went
on
laughing
for
some
minutes
,
nobody
knew
why
or
wherefore
,
until
the
party
was
increased
by
Mr.
Wood
,
in
his
Sunday
habiliments
and
Sunday
buckle
.
<EOS>
Without
stopping
to
inquire
into
the
cause
of
their
mirth
,
or
even
to
ask
the
names
of
his
guests
,
the
worthy
carpenter
shook
hands
with
the
one
-
eyed
chapmen
,
slapped
Mr.
Kneebone
cordially
on
the
shoulder
,
and
began
to
laugh
as
heartily
as
any
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wood
could
stand
it
no
longer
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
're
all
bewitched
,
"
she
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
we
are
,
Ma'am
,
by
your
charms
,
"
returned
Mr.
Jackson
,
gallantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Quite
captivated
,
Ma'am
,
"
added
Mr.
Smith
,
placing
his
hand
on
his
breast
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Kneebone
and
Mr.
Wood
laughed
louder
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Wood
,
"
said
the
lady
bridling
up
,
"
my
request
may
,
perhaps
,
have
some
weight
with
_
<EOS>
you
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
I
desire
,
Sir
,
you
'll
recollect
yourself
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kneebone
,
"
she
added
,
with
a
glance
at
that
gentleman
,
which
was
meant
to
speak
daggers
,
"
will
do
as
he
pleases
.
"
 
<EOS>
Here
the
chapmen
set
up
another
boisterous
peal
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
offence
,
I
hope
,
my
dear
Mrs.
W
,
"
said
Mr.
Kneebone
in
a
conciliatory
tone
.
<EOS>
"
My
friends
,
Mr.
Jackson
and
Mr.
Smith
,
may
have
rather
odd
ways
with
them
;
but--
"
 
"
They
_
have
_
very
odd
ways
,
"
interrupted
Mrs.
Wood
,
disdainfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
Our
worthy
friend
was
going
to
observe
,
Ma'am
,
that
we
never
fail
in
our
devotion
to
the
fair
sex
,
"
said
Mr.
Jackson
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
,
Ma'am
!
"
echoed
Mr.
Smith
,
"
upon
my
conscience
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
said
the
hospitable
carpenter
,
"
I
dare
say
Mr.
Kneebone
and
his
friends
would
be
glad
of
a
little
refreshment
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
shall
have
it
,
then
,
"
replied
his
better
half
,
rising
.
<EOS>
"
You
base
ingrate
,
"
she
added
,
in
a
whisper
,
as
she
flounced
past
Mr.
Kneebone
on
her
way
to
the
door
,
"
how
could
you
bring
such
creatures
with
you
,
especially
on
an
occasion
like
this
,
when
we
have
n't
met
for
a
fortnight
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Could
n't
help
it
,
my
life
,
"
returned
the
gentleman
addressed
,
in
the
same
tone
;
"
but
you
little
know
who
those
individuals
are
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Lord
bless
us
!
<EOS>
you
alarm
me
.
<EOS>
Who
are
they
?
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Kneebone
assumed
a
mysterious
air
;
and
bringing
his
lips
close
to
Mrs.
Wood
's
ear
,
whispered
,
"
secret
agents
from
France
--
you
understand
--
friends
to
the
cause
--
hem
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
see,--persons
of
rank
!
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Kneebone
nodded
.
 
<EOS>
"
Noblemen
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Kneebone
smiled
assent
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mercy
on
us
!
<EOS>
Well
,
I
thought
their
manners
quite
out
o
'
the
common
.
<EOS>
And
so
,
the
invasion
really
is
to
take
place
after
all
;
and
the
Chevalier
de
Saint
George
is
to
land
at
the
Tower
with
fifty
thousand
Frenchmen
;
and
the
Hanoverian
usurper
's
to
be
beheaded
;
and
Doctor
Sacheverel
's
to
be
made
a
bishop
,
and
we
're
all
to
be
--
eh
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
All
in
good
time
,
"
returned
Kneebone
,
putting
his
finger
to
his
lips
;
"
do
n't
let
your
imagination
run
away
with
you
,
my
charmer
.
<EOS>
That
boy
,
"
he
added
,
looking
at
Thames
,
"
has
his
eye
upon
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wood
,
however
,
was
too
much
excited
to
attend
to
the
caution
.
 
<EOS>
"
O
,
lud
!
<EOS>
"
she
cried
;
"
French
noblemen
in
disguise
!
<EOS>
and
so
rude
as
I
was
!
<EOS>
I
shall
never
recover
it
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
good
supper
will
set
all
to
rights
,
"
insinuated
Kneebone
.
"
<EOS>
But
be
prudent
,
my
angel
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
fear
,
"
replied
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
prudence
personified
.
<EOS>
You
might
trust
me
with
the
Chevalier
himself,--I'd
never
betray
him
.
<EOS>
But
why
did
n't
you
let
me
know
they
were
coming
.
<EOS>
I
'd
have
got
something
nice
.
<EOS>
As
it
is
,
we
've
only
a
couple
of
ducks
--
and
they
were
intended
for
you
.
<EOS>
Winny
,
my
love
,
come
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
shall
want
you.--Sorry
to
quit
your
lord
--
worships
<EOS>
,
I
mean,--I
do
n't
know
what
I
mean
,
"
she
added
,
a
little
confused
,
and
dropping
a
profound
curtsey
to
the
disguised
noblemen
,
each
of
whom
replied
by
a
bow
,
worthy
,
in
her
opinion
,
of
a
prince
of
the
blood
at
the
least,--"but
<EOS>
I
've
a
few
necessary
orders
to
give
below
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Do
n't
mind
us
,
Ma'am
,
"
said
Mr.
Jackson
:
"
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
in
the
least
,
Ma'am
,
"
echoed
Mr.
Smith
:
"
ho
!
ho
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
condescending
!
<EOS>
"
thought
Mrs.
Wood
.
"
<EOS>
Not
proud
in
the
least
,
I
declare
.
<EOS>
Well
,
I
'd
no
idea
,
"
she
continued
,
pursuing
her
ruminations
as
she
left
the
room
,
"
that
people
of
quality
laughed
so
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
French
manners
,
I
suppose
.

"
    
CHAPTER
V.
 
Hawk
and
Buzzard
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wood
's
anxiety
to
please
her
distinguished
guests
speedily
displayed
itself
in
a
very
plentiful
,
if
not
very
dainty
repast
.
<EOS>
To
the
duckling
,
peas
,
and
other
delicacies
,
intended
for
Mr.
Kneebone
's
special
consumption
,
she
added
a
few
impromptu
dishes
,
tossed
off
in
her
best
style
;
such
as
lamb
chops
,
broiled
kidneys
,
fried
ham
and
eggs
,
and
toasted
cheese
.
<EOS>
Side
by
side
with
the
cheese
(
its
never
-
failing
accompaniment
,
in
all
seasons
,
at
the
carpenter
's
board
)
came
a
tankard
of
swig
,
and
a
toast
.
<EOS>
Besides
these
there
was
a
warm
gooseberry
-
tart
,
and
a
cold
pigeon
pie
--
the
latter
capacious
enough
,
even
allowing
for
its
due
complement
of
steak
,
to
contain
the
whole
produce
of
a
dovecot
;
a
couple
of
lobsters
and
the
best
part
of
a
salmon
swimming
in
a
sea
of
vinegar
,
and
shaded
by
a
forest
of
fennel
.
<EOS>
While
the
cloth
was
laid
,
the
host
and
Thames
descended
to
the
cellar
,
whence
they
returned
,
laden
with
a
number
of
flasks
of
the
same
form
,
and
apparently
destined
to
the
same
use
as
those
depicted
in
Hogarth
's
delectable
print
--
the
Modern
Midnight
Conversation
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wood
now
re
-
appeared
with
a
very
red
face
;
and
,
followed
by
Winifred
,
took
her
seat
at
the
table
.
<EOS>
Operations
then
commenced
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wood
carved
the
ducks
;
Mr.
Kneebone
helped
to
the
pigeon
-
pie
;
while
Thames
unwired
and
uncorked
a
bottle
of
stout
Carnarvonshire
ale
.
<EOS>
The
woollen
-
draper
was
no
despicable
trencherman
in
a
general
way
;
but
his
feats
with
the
knife
and
fork
were
child
's
sport
compared
with
those
of
Mr.
Smith
.
<EOS>
The
leg
and
wing
of
a
duck
were
disposed
of
by
this
gentleman
in
a
twinkling
;
a
brace
of
pigeons
and
a
pound
of
steak
followed
with
equal
celerity
;
and
he
had
just
begun
to
make
a
fierce
assault
upon
the
eggs
and
ham
.
<EOS>
His
appetite
was
perfectly
Gargantuan
.
<EOS>
Nor
must
it
be
imagined
,
that
while
he
thus
exercised
his
teeth
,
he
neglected
the
flagon
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
his
glass
was
never
idle
,
and
finding
it
not
filled
quite
so
frequently
as
he
desired
,
he
applied
himself
,
notwithstanding
the
expressive
looks
and
muttered
remonstrances
of
Mr.
Jackson
,
to
the
swig
.
<EOS>
The
latter
gentleman
did
full
justice
to
the
good
things
before
him
;
but
he
drank
sparingly
,
and
was
visibly
annoyed
by
his
companion
's
intemperance
.
<EOS>
As
to
Mr.
Kneebone
,
what
with
flirting
with
Mrs.
Wood
,
carving
for
his
friends
,
and
pledging
the
carpenter
,
he
had
his
hands
full
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
and
just
as
a
cuckoo
-
clock
in
the
corner
struck
sis
,
Jack
Sheppard
walked
into
the
room
,
with
the
packing
-
case
under
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
in
the
right
,
you
see
,
father
,
"
observed
Thames
,
smiling
;
"
Jack
_
has
_
done
his
task
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
I
perceive
,
"
replied
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
am
I
to
take
it
to
?
"
asked
Sheppard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
that
before
,
"
rejoined
Wood
,
testily
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
take
it
to
Sir
Rowland
Trenchard
's
in
Southampton
Fields
.
<EOS>
And
,
mind
,
it
's
for
his
sister
,
Lady
Trafford
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Sheppard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wet
your
whistle
before
you
start
,
Jack
,
"
said
Kneebone
,
pouring
out
a
glass
of
ale
.
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
you
're
taking
to
Sir
Rowland
Trenchard
's
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Only
a
box
,
Sir
,
"
answered
Sheppard
,
emptying
the
glass
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
an
odd
-
shaped
one
,
"
rejoined
Kneebone
,
examining
it
attentively
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
can
guess
what
it
's
for
.
<EOS>
Sir
Rowland
is
one
of
_
us
_
,
"
he
added
,
winking
at
his
companions
,
"
and
so
was
his
brother
-
in
-
law
,
Sir
Cecil
Trafford
.
<EOS>
Old
Lancashire
families
both
.
<EOS>
Strict
Catholics
,
and
loyal
to
the
backbone
.
<EOS>
Fine
woman
,
Lady
Trafford
--
a
little
on
the
wane
though
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
're
so
very
particular
,
"
sighed
Mrs.
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
in
the
least
,
"
returned
Kneebone
,
slyly
,
"
not
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
Another
glass
,
Jack
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee
,
Sir
,
"
grinned
Sheppard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Off
with
it
to
the
health
of
King
James
the
Third
,
and
confusion
to
his
enemies
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hold
!
"
<EOS>
interposed
Wood
<EOS>
;
"
that
is
treason
.
<EOS>
I
'll
have
no
such
toast
drunk
at
my
table
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
king
's
birthday
,
"
urged
the
woollen
draper
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
_
<EOS>
my
_
king
's
,
"
returned
Wood
.
<EOS>
"
I
quarrel
with
no
man
's
political
opinions
,
but
I
will
have
my
own
respected
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Eh
day
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Wood
;
"
here
's
a
pretty
to
-
do
about
nothing
.
<EOS>
Marry
,
come
up
!
<EOS>
I
'll
see
who
's
to
be
obeyed
.
<EOS>
Drink
the
toast
,
Jack
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
At
your
peril
,
sirrah
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
was
hanged
that
left
his
drink
behind
,
you
know
,
master
,
"
rejoined
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
Here
's
King
James
the
Third
,
and
confusion
to
his
enemies
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
said
the
carpenter
,
sitting
down
amid
the
laughter
of
the
company
.
 
<EOS>
"
Jack
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Thames
,
in
a
loud
voice
,
"
you
deserve
to
be
hanged
for
a
rebel
as
you
are
to
your
lawful
king
and
your
lawful
master
.
<EOS>
But
since
we
must
have
toasts
,
"
he
added
,
snatching
up
a
glass
,
"
listen
to
mine
:
<EOS>
Here
's
King
George
the
First
!
<EOS>
a
long
reign
to
him
!
<EOS>
and
confusion
to
the
Popish
Pretender
and
his
adherents
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Bravely
done
!
"
<EOS>
said
Wood
,
with
tears
in
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
kinchin
<EOS>
as
was
to
try
the
dub
for
us
,
ai
n't
it
?
"
<EOS>
muttered
Smith
to
his
companion
as
he
stole
a
glance
at
Jack
Sheppard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Silence
!
"
returned
Jackson
,
in
a
deep
whisper
;
"
and
do
n't
muddle
your
brains
with
any
more
of
that
Pharaoh
.
<EOS>
You
'll
need
all
your
strength
to
grab
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
"
remarked
Kneebone
,
addressing
Sheppard
,
who
,
as
he
caught
the
single
but
piercing
eye
of
Jackson
fixed
upon
him
,
started
and
trembled
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
repeated
Mrs.
Wood
in
a
sharp
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
what
's
the
matter
,
boy
!
"
<EOS>
reiterated
Jackson
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
Did
you
never
see
two
gentlemen
with
only
a
couple
of
peepers
between
them
before
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
,
I
'll
be
sworn
!
"
<EOS>
said
Smith
,
taking
the
opportunity
of
filling
his
glass
while
his
comrade
's
back
was
turned
;
"
we
're
a
nat'ral
cur'osity
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Can
I
have
a
word
with
you
,
master
?
"
said
Sheppard
,
approaching
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
a
syllable
!
<EOS>
"
answered
the
carpenter
,
angrily
.
"
<EOS>
Get
about
your
business
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Thames
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jack
,
beckoning
to
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
But
Darrell
averted
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mistress
!
"
said
the
apprentice
,
making
a
final
appeal
to
Mrs.
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
"
Leave
the
room
instantly
,
sirrah
!
"
rejoined
the
lady
,
bouncing
up
,
and
giving
him
a
slap
on
the
cheek
that
made
his
eyes
flash
fire
.
 
<EOS>
"
May
I
be
cursed
,
"
muttered
Sheppard
,
as
he
slunk
away
with
(
as
the
woollen
-
draper
pleasantly
observed
)
'
<EOS>
a
couple
of
boxes
in
charge
,
'
"
<EOS>
if
ever
I
try
to
be
honest
again
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Take
a
little
toasted
cheese
with
the
swig
,
Mr.
Smith
,
"
observed
Wood
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
an
incorrigible
rascal
,
"
he
added
,
as
Sheppard
closed
the
door
;
"
it
's
only
to
-
day
that
I
discovered--
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
?
"
asked
Jackson
,
pricking
up
his
ears
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
speak
ill
of
him
behind
his
back
,
father
,
"
interposed
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
_
I
_
were
your
father
,
young
gentleman
,
"
returned
Jackson
,
enraged
at
the
interruption
,
"
I
'd
teach
_
you
_
not
to
speak
till
you
were
spoken
to
.
"
 
<EOS>
Thames
was
about
to
reply
,
but
a
glance
from
Wood
checked
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
rebuke
is
just
,
"
said
the
carpenter
;
"
at
the
same
time
,
I
'm
not
sorry
to
find
you
're
a
friend
to
fair
play
,
which
,
as
you
seem
to
know
,
is
a
jewel
.
<EOS>
Open
that
bottle
with
a
blue
seal
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
Gentlemen
!
<EOS>
a
glass
of
brandy
will
be
no
bad
finish
to
our
meal
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
proposal
giving
general
satisfaction
,
the
bottle
circulated
swiftly
;
and
Smith
found
the
liquor
so
much
to
his
taste
,
that
he
made
it
pay
double
toll
on
its
passage
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
son
is
a
lad
of
spirit
,
Mr.
Wood
,
"
observed
Jackson
,
in
a
slightly
-
sarcastic
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
not
my
son
,
"
rejoined
the
carpenter
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
,
Sir
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Except
by
adoption
.
<EOS>
Thames
Darrell
is--
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
husband
nicknames
him
Thames
,
"
interrupted
Mrs.
Wood
,
"
because
he
found
him
in
the
river!--ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
ha
!
"
echoed
Smith
,
taking
another
bumper
of
brandy
;
"
he
'll
set
the
Thames
on
fire
one
of
these
days
,
I
'll
warrant
him
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
more
than
you
'll
ever
do
,
you
drunken
fool
!
"
<EOS>
growled
Jackson
,
in
an
under
tone
:
"
be
cautious
,
or
you
'll
spoil
all
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Suppose
we
send
for
a
bowl
of
punch
,
"
said
Kneebone
.
 
<EOS>
"
With
all
my
heart
!
"
replied
Wood
.
<EOS>
And
,
turning
to
his
daughter
,
he
gave
the
necessary
directions
in
a
low
tone
.
 
<EOS>
Winifred
,
accordingly
,
left
the
room
,
and
a
servant
being
despatched
to
the
nearest
tavern
,
soon
afterwards
returned
with
a
crown
bowl
of
the
ambrosian
fluid
.
<EOS>
The
tables
were
then
cleared
.
<EOS>
Bottles
and
glasses
usurped
the
place
of
dishes
and
plates
.
<EOS>
Pipes
were
lighted
;
and
Mr.
Kneebone
began
to
dispense
the
fragrant
fluid
;
begging
Mrs.
Wood
,
in
a
whisper
,
as
he
filled
a
rummer
to
the
brim
,
not
to
forget
the
health
of
the
Chevalier
de
Saint
George
--
a
proposition
to
which
the
lady
immediately
responded
by
drinking
the
toast
aloud
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
Chevalier
shall
hear
of
this
,
"
whispered
the
woollen
-
draper
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
say
so
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Mrs.
Wood
,
delighted
at
the
idea
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Kneebone
assured
her
that
he
_
did
_
say
so
;
and
,
as
a
further
proof
of
his
sincerity
,
squeezed
her
hand
very
warmly
under
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Smith
,
now
,
being
more
than
half
-
seas
over
,
became
very
uproarious
,
and
,
claiming
the
attention
of
the
table
,
volunteered
the
following
     
DRINKING
SONG
.
     
<EOS>
I.
     
Jolly
nose
!
<EOS>
the
bright
rubies
that
garnish
thy
tip
      
Are
dug
from
the
mines
of
canary
;
    
And
to
keep
up
their
lustre
<EOS>
I
moisten
my
lip
      
With
hogsheads
of
claret
and
sherry
.
     
<EOS>
II
.
     
<EOS>
Jolly
nose
!
<EOS>
he
who
sees
thee
across
a
broad
glass
      
Beholds
thee
in
all
thy
perfection
;
    
And
to
the
pale
snout
of
a
temperate
ass
      
Entertains
the
profoundest
objection
.
     
<EOS>
III
.
     
<EOS>
For
a
big
-
bellied
glass
is
the
palette
I
use
,
      
<EOS>
And
the
choicest
of
wine
is
my
colour
;
    
<EOS>
And
I
find
that
my
nose
takes
the
mellowest
hues
      
<EOS>
The
fuller
I
fill
it
--
the
fuller
!
     
<EOS>
IV
.
     
<EOS>
Jolly
nose
!
<EOS>
there
are
fools
who
say
drink
hurts
the
sight
;
      
Such
dullards
know
nothing
about
it
.
    
<EOS>
'
T
is
better
,
with
wine
,
to
extinguish
the
light
,
      
<EOS>
Than
live
always
,
in
darkness
,
without
it
!
 
<EOS>
"
How
long
may
it
be
since
that
boy
was
found
in
the
way
Mrs.
Wood
mentions
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Jackson
,
as
soon
as
the
clatter
that
succeeded
Mr.
Smith
's
melody
had
subsided
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
,
"
replied
Wood
;
"
exactly
twelve
years
ago
last
November
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
that
must
be
about
the
time
of
the
Great
Storm
,
"
rejoined
Jackson
.
 
<EOS>
"
Egad
!
"
exclaimed
Wood
,
"
you
've
hit
the
right
nail
on
the
head
,
anyhow
.
<EOS>
It
_
was
_
on
the
night
of
the
Great
Storm
that
I
found
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
hear
all
particulars
of
the
affair
,
"
said
Jackson
,
"
if
it
would
n't
be
troubling
you
too
much
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Wood
required
little
pressing
.
<EOS>
He
took
a
sip
of
punch
and
commenced
his
relation
.
<EOS>
Though
meant
to
produce
a
totally
different
effect
,
the
narrative
seemed
to
excite
the
risible
propensities
rather
than
the
commiseration
of
his
auditor
;
and
when
Mr.
Wood
wound
it
up
by
a
description
of
the
drenching
he
had
undergone
at
the
Mint
pump
,
the
other
could
hold
out
no
longer
,
but
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
,
gave
free
scope
to
his
merriment
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
he
cried
;
"
but
really
--
ha
!
<EOS>
ha!--you
must
excuse
me!--that
is
so
uncommonly
diverting
--
ha
!
ha
!
<EOS>
Do
let
me
hear
it
<EOS>
again?--ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
"
rejoined
Wood
,
"
you
seem
vastly
entertained
by
my
misfortunes
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
To
be
sure
!
<EOS>
Nothing
entertains
me
so
much
.
<EOS>
People
always
rejoice
at
the
misfortunes
of
others
--
never
at
their
own
!
<EOS>
The
droll
dogs
!
<EOS>
how
_
they
_
must
have
enjoyed
it!--ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
they
did
.
<EOS>
But
_
I
_
found
it
no
laughing
matter
,
I
can
assure
you
.
<EOS>
And
,
though
it
's
a
long
time
ago
,
I
feel
as
sore
on
the
subject
as
ever
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Quite
natural
!
<EOS>
Never
forgive
an
injury!--_I
_
never
do!--ha
!
ha
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Really
,
Mr.
Jackson
,
I
could
almost
fancy
we
had
met
before
.
<EOS>
Your
laugh
reminds
me
of
--
of----
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Whose
,
Sir
?
"
demanded
Jackson
,
becoming
suddenly
grave
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
'll
not
be
offended
,
I
hope
,
"
returned
Wood
,
drily
,
"
if
I
say
that
your
voice
,
your
manner
,
and
,
above
all
,
your
very
extraordinary
way
of
laughing
,
put
me
strangely
in
mind
of
one
of
the
'
droll
dogs
,
'
(
as
you
term
them
,
)
who
helped
to
perpetrate
the
outrage
I
've
just
described
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Whom
do
you
mean
?
"
demanded
Jackson
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
allude
to
an
individual
,
who
has
since
acquired
an
infamous
notoriety
as
a
thief
-
taker
;
but
who
,
in
those
days
,
was
himself
the
associate
of
thieves
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sir
,
his
name
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Jonathan
Wild
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
'
Sblood
!
"
cried
Jackson
,
rising
,
"
I
ca
n't
sit
still
and
hear
Mr.
Wild
,
whom
I
believe
to
be
as
honest
a
gentleman
as
any
in
the
kingdom
,
calumniated
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Fire
and
fury
!
"
exclaimed
Smith
,
getting
up
with
the
brandy
-
bottle
in
his
grasp
<EOS>
;
"
no
man
shall
abuse
Mr.
Wild
in
my
presence
!
<EOS>
He
's
the
right
-
hand
of
the
community
!
<EOS>
We
could
do
nothing
without
him
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
_
We
!
<EOS>
_
"
repeated
Wood
,
significantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Every
honest
man
,
Sir
!
<EOS>
He
helps
us
to
our
own
again
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
the
carpenter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Surely
,
"
observed
Thames
,
laughing
,
"
to
one
who
entertains
so
high
an
opinion
of
Jonathan
Wild
,
<EOS>
as
Mr.
Jackson
appears
to
do
,
it
ca
n't
be
very
offensive
to
be
told
,
that
he
's
like
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
object
to
the
likeness
,
if
any
such
exists
,
young
Sir
,
"
returned
Jackson
,
darting
an
angry
glance
at
Thames
;
"
indeed
I
'm
rather
flattered
by
being
thought
to
resemble
a
gentleman
of
Mr.
Wild
's
figure
.
<EOS>
But
I
ca
n't
submit
to
hear
the
well
-
earned
reputation
of
my
friend
termed
an
'
infamous
notoriety
.
'
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
we
ca
n't
stand
that
,
"
hiccupped
Smith
,
scarcely
able
to
keep
his
legs
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
gentlemen
,
"
rejoined
Wood
,
mildly
;
"
<EOS>
since
Mr.
Wild
is
a
friend
of
yours
,
I
'm
sorry
for
what
I
said
.
<EOS>
I
've
no
doubt
he
's
as
honest
as
either
of
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Enough
,
"
returned
Jackson
,
extending
his
hand
;
"
and
if
I
've
expressed
myself
warmly
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sorry
for
it
likewise
.
<EOS>
But
you
must
allow
me
to
observe
,
my
good
Sir
,
that
you
're
wholly
in
the
wrong
respecting
my
friend
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wild
never
was
the
associate
of
thieves
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
,
"
echoed
Smith
,
emphatically
,
"
upon
my
honour
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
satisfied
with
your
assurance
,
"
replied
the
carpenter
,
drily
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
more
than
I
am
,
"
muttered
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
not
aware
that
Jonathan
Wild
was
an
acquaintance
of
yours
,
Mr.
Jackson
,
"
said
Kneebone
,
whose
assiduity
to
Mrs.
Wood
had
prevented
him
from
paying
much
attention
to
the
previous
scene
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
known
him
all
my
life
,
"
replied
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
devil
you
have
!
<EOS>
Then
,
perhaps
,
you
can
tell
me
when
he
intends
to
put
his
threat
into
execution
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
threat
?
"
asked
Jackson
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
of
hanging
the
fellow
who
acts
as
his
jackal
;
one
Blake
,
or
Blueskin
,
I
think
he
's
called
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
've
been
misinformed
,
Sir
,
"
interposed
Smith
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Wild
is
incapable
of
such
baseness
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Bah
!
"
returned
the
woollen
-
draper
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
you
do
n't
know
him
as
well
as
you
pretend
.
<EOS>
Jonathan
is
capable
of
anything
.
<EOS>
He
has
hanged
twelve
of
his
associates
already
.
<EOS>
The
moment
they
cease
to
be
serviceable
,
or
become
dangerous
he
lodges
an
information
,
and
the
matter
's
settled
.
<EOS>
He
has
always
plenty
of
evidence
in
reserve
.
<EOS>
Blueskin
is
booked
.
<EOS>
As
sure
as
you
're
sitting
there
,
Mr.
Smith
,
he
'll
swing
after
next
Old
Bailey
sessions
.
<EOS>
I
would
n't
be
in
his
skin
for
a
trifle
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
he
may
peach
,
"
said
Smith
casting
an
oblique
glance
at
Jackson
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
avail
him
little
if
he
did
,
"
replied
Kneebone
.
<EOS>
"
Jonathan
does
what
he
pleases
in
the
courts
.
"
 
"
Very
true
,
"
chuckled
Jackson
;
"
very
true
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Blueskin
's
only
chance
would
be
to
carry
_
his
_
threat
into
effect
,
"
pursued
the
woollen
-
draper
.
 
<EOS>
"
Aha
!
"
exclaimed
Jackson
.
"
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
He
_
threatens
,
does
he
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
More
than
that
,
"
replied
Kneebone
;
"
<EOS>
I
understand
he
drew
a
knife
upon
Jonathan
,
in
a
quarrel
between
them
lately
.
<EOS>
And
since
then
,
he
has
openly
avowed
his
determination
of
cutting
his
master
's
throat
on
the
slightest
inkling
of
treachery
.
<EOS>
But
,
perhaps
Mr.
Smith
will
tell
you
I
'm
misinformed
,
also
,
on
that
point
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
On
the
contrary
,
"
rejoined
Smith
,
looking
askance
at
his
companion
<EOS>
,
"
I
happen
to
_
know
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
you
're
in
the
right
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sir
,
I
'm
obliged
to
you
,
"
said
Jackson
;
"
I
shall
take
care
to
put
Mr.
Wild
on
his
guard
against
an
assassin
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
shall
put
Blueskin
on
the
alert
against
the
designs
of
a
traitor
,
"
rejoined
Smith
,
in
a
tone
that
sounded
like
a
menace
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
my
opinion
,
"
remarked
Kneebone
,
"
it
does
n't
matter
how
soon
society
is
rid
of
two
such
scoundrels
;
and
if
Blueskin
dies
by
the
rope
,
and
Jonathan
by
the
hand
of
violence
,
they
'll
meet
the
fate
they
merit
.
<EOS>
Wild
was
formerly
an
agent
to
the
Jacobite
party
,
but
,
on
the
offer
of
a
bribe
from
the
opposite
faction
,
he
unhesitatingly
deserted
and
betrayed
his
old
employers
.
<EOS>
Of
late
,
he
has
become
the
instrument
of
Walpole
,
and
does
all
the
dirty
work
for
the
Secret
Committee
.
<EOS>
Several
arrests
of
importance
have
been
intrusted
to
him
;
but
,
forewarned
,
forearmed
,
we
have
constantly
baffled
his
schemes;--ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
Jonathan
's
a
devilish
clever
fellow
.
<EOS>
But
he
ca
n't
have
his
eyes
always
about
him
,
or
he
'd
have
been
with
us
this
morning
at
the
Mint
,
eh
,
Mr.
Jackson
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
he
would
,
"
replied
the
latter
:
"
<EOS>
so
he
would
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
With
all
his
cunning
,
he
may
meet
with
his
match
,
"
continued
Kneebone
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
set
a
trap
for
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Take
care
<EOS>
you
do
n't
fall
into
it
yourself
,
"
returned
Jackson
,
with
a
slight
sneer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Were
I
in
your
place
,
"
said
Smith
,
"
I
should
be
apprehensive
of
Wild
,
because
he
's
a
declared
enemy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
were
I
in
_
yours
_
,
"
rejoined
the
woollen
-
draper
,
"
I
should
be
doubly
apprehensive
,
because
he
's
a
professed
friend
.
<EOS>
But
we
're
neglecting
the
punch
all
this
time
.
<EOS>
A
bumper
round
,
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
Success
to
our
enterprise
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Success
to
our
enterprise
!
"
echoed
the
others
,
significantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
whether
you
made
any
further
inquiries
into
the
mysterious
affair
about
which
we
were
speaking
just
now
?
"
<EOS>
observed
Jackson
,
turning
to
the
carpenter
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
say
I
did
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Wood
,
somewhat
reluctantly
;
"
what
with
the
confusion
incident
to
the
storm
,
and
the
subsequent
press
of
business
,
I
put
it
off
till
it
was
too
late
.
<EOS>
I
've
often
regretted
that
I
did
n't
investigate
the
matter
.
<EOS>
However
,
it
does
n't
much
signify
.
<EOS>
All
concerned
in
the
dark
transaction
must
have
perished
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
sure
of
that
,
"
inquired
Jackson
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
sure
as
one
reasonably
can
be
.
<EOS>
I
saw
their
boat
swept
away
,
and
heard
the
roar
of
the
fall
beneath
the
bridge
;
and
no
one
,
who
was
present
,
could
doubt
the
result
.
<EOS>
If
the
principal
instigator
of
the
crime
,
whom
I
afterwards
encountered
on
the
platform
,
and
who
was
dashed
into
the
raging
flood
by
the
shower
of
bricks
,
escaped
,
his
preservation
must
have
been
indeed
miraculous
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
own
was
equally
so
,
"
said
Jackson
ironically
.
<EOS>
"
What
if
he
_
did
_
escape
?
"
 
"
My
utmost
efforts
should
be
used
to
bring
him
to
justice
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hum
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
any
reason
to
suppose
he
survived
the
accident
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Thames
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
Jackson
smiled
and
put
on
the
air
of
a
man
who
knows
more
than
he
cares
to
tell
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
merely
asked
the
question
,
"
he
said
,
after
he
had
enjoyed
the
boy
's
suspense
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
The
hope
that
had
been
suddenly
kindled
in
the
youth
's
bosom
was
as
suddenly
extinguished
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
I
thought
he
lived----
"
observed
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
"
_
<EOS>
If
_
,
"
interrupted
Jackson
,
changing
his
tone
:
"
he
_
does
_
live
.
<EOS>
And
it
has
been
well
for
you
that
he
imagines
the
child
was
drowned
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Who
is
he
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Thames
impatiently
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
inquisitive
,
young
gentleman
,
"
replied
Jackson
,
coldly
.
<EOS>
"
When
you
're
older
,
you
'll
know
that
secrets
of
importance
are
not
disclosed
gratuitously
.
<EOS>
Your
adoptive
father
understands
mankind
better
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'd
give
half
<EOS>
I
'm
worth
to
hang
the
villain
,
and
restore
this
boy
to
his
rights
,
"
said
Mr.
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
know
he
_
has
_
any
rights
to
be
restored
to
?
"
<EOS>
returned
Jackson
,
with
a
grin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Judging
from
what
you
tell
me
,
I
've
no
doubt
he
's
the
illegitimate
offspring
of
some
handsome
,
but
lowborn
profligate
;
in
which
case
,
he
'll
neither
have
name
,
nor
wealth
for
his
inheritance
.
<EOS>
The
assassination
,
as
you
call
it
,
was
,
obviously
,
the
vengeance
of
a
kinsman
of
the
injured
lady
,
who
no
doubt
was
of
good
family
,
upon
her
seducer
.
<EOS>
The
less
said
,
therefore
,
on
this
point
the
better
;
because
,
as
nothing
is
to
be
gained
by
it
,
it
would
only
be
trouble
thrown
away
.
<EOS>
But
,
if
you
have
any
particular
fancy
for
hanging
the
gentleman
,
who
chose
to
take
the
law
into
his
own
hands
--
and
I
think
your
motive
extremely
disinterested
and
praiseworthy
--
why
,
it
's
just
possible
,
if
you
make
it
worth
my
while
,
that
your
desires
may
be
gratified
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
how
this
is
to
be
effected
,
unless
you
yourself
were
present
at
the
time
,
"
said
Wood
,
glancing
suspiciously
at
the
speaker
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
had
no
hand
in
the
affair
,
"
replied
Jackson
,
bluntly
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
know
those
who
had
;
and
could
bring
forward
evidence
,
if
you
require
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
best
evidence
would
be
afforded
by
an
accomplice
of
the
assassin
,
"
rejoined
Thames
,
who
was
greatly
offended
by
the
insinuation
as
to
his
parentage
.
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
could
point
out
such
a
party
,
Mr.
Jackson
?
"
said
Wood
,
significantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
,
"
replied
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
need
no
further
information
from
me
,
"
rejoined
Jackson
,
sternly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stay
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Wood
<EOS>
,
"
this
is
a
most
perplexing
business
--
if
you
really
are
privy
to
the
affair----
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
'll
talk
of
it
to
-
morrow
,
Sir
,
"
returned
Jackson
,
cutting
him
short
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
with
your
permission
,
I
'll
just
make
a
few
minutes
of
our
conversation
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
As
many
as
you
please
,
"
replied
Wood
,
walking
towards
the
chimney
-
piece
,
and
taking
down
a
constable
's
,
staff
,
which
hung
upon
a
nail
.
 
<EOS>
Jackson
,
mean
time
,
produced
a
pocket
-
book
;
and
,
after
deliberately
sharpening
the
point
of
a
pencil
,
began
to
write
on
a
blank
leaf
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
thus
occupied
,
Thames
,
prompted
by
an
unaccountable
feeling
of
curiosity
,
took
up
the
penknife
which
the
other
had
just
used
,
and
examined
the
haft
.
<EOS>
What
he
there
noticed
occasioned
a
marked
change
in
his
demeanour
.
<EOS>
He
laid
down
the
knife
,
and
fixed
a
searching
and
distrustful
gaze
upon
the
writer
,
who
continued
his
task
,
unconscious
of
anything
having
happened
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
,
"
cried
Jackson
,
closing
the
book
and
rising
,
"
that
'll
do
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
at
twelve
I
'll
be
with
you
,
Mr.
Wood
.
<EOS>
Make
up
your
mind
as
to
the
terms
,
and
I
'll
engage
to
find
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hold
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
carpenter
,
in
an
authoritative
voice
:
"
we
ca
n't
part
thus
.
<EOS>
Thames
,
look
the
door
.
"
<EOS>
(
An
order
which
was
promptly
obeyed
.
)
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Sir
,
I
must
insist
upon
a
full
explanation
of
your
mysterious
hints
,
or
,
as
I
am
headborough
of
the
district
,
I
shall
at
once
take
you
into
custody
.
"
 
<EOS>
Jackson
treated
this
menace
with
a
loud
laugh
of
derision
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
ho
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
slapping
Smith
,
who
had
fallen
asleep
with
the
brandy
-
bottle
in
his
grasp
,
upon
the
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
time
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
For
what
?
"
grumbled
the
latter
,
rubbing
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
the
caption
!
"
replied
Jackson
,
coolly
drawing
a
brace
of
pistols
from
his
pockets
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ready
!
"
<EOS>
answered
Smith
,
shaking
himself
,
and
producing
a
similar
pair
of
weapons
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
Heaven
's
name
!
<EOS>
what
's
all
this
?
"
cried
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
still
,
and
you
'll
receive
no
injury
,
"
returned
Jackson
.
<EOS>
"
We
're
merely
about
to
discharge
our
duty
by
apprehending
a
rebel
.
<EOS>
Captain
Kneebone
!
<EOS>
we
must
trouble
you
to
accompany
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
no
intention
of
stirring
,
"
replied
the
woollen
-
draper
,
who
was
thus
unceremoniously
disturbed
:
"
<EOS>
and
I
beg
you
'll
sit
down
,
Mr.
Jackson
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Sir
!
"
thundered
the
latter
,
"
no
trifling
!
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
"
he
added
,
opening
a
warrant
,
"
you
'll
obey
this
mandate
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
warrant
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Kneebone
,
starting
to
his
feet
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
Sir
,
from
the
Secretary
of
State
,
for
_
your
_
arrest
!
<EOS>
You
're
charged
with
high
-
treason
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
By
those
who
've
conspired
with
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
!
<EOS>
by
those
who
've
entrapped
you
!
<EOS>
You
've
long
eluded
our
vigilance
;
but
we
've
caught
you
at
last
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Damnation
!
"
exclaimed
the
woollen
-
draper
<EOS>
;
"
that
I
should
be
the
dupe
of
such
a
miserable
artifice
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
no
use
lamenting
now
,
Captain
!
<EOS>
You
ought
rather
to
be
obliged
to
us
for
allowing
you
to
pay
this
visit
.
<EOS>
We
could
have
secured
you
when
you
left
the
Mint
.
<EOS>
But
we
wished
to
ascertain
whether
Mrs.
Wood
's
charms
equalled
your
description
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Wretches
!
"
screamed
the
lady
;
"
do
n't
dare
to
breathe
your
vile
insinuations
against
me
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Kneebone
,
are
these
your
French
noblemen
?
"
 
"
Do
n't
upbraid
me
!
"
rejoined
the
woollen
-
draper
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bring
him
along
,
Joe
!
"
<EOS>
said
Jackson
,
in
a
whisper
to
his
comrade
.
 
<EOS>
Smith
obeyed
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
scarcely
advanced
a
step
,
when
he
was
felled
to
the
ground
by
a
blow
from
the
powerful
arm
of
Kneebone
,
who
,
instantly
possessing
himself
of
a
pistol
,
levelled
it
at
Jackson
's
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
Begone
!
<EOS>
or
I
fire
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Wood
,
"
returned
Jackson
,
with
the
utmost
composure
;
"
you
're
a
headborough
,
and
a
loyal
subject
of
King
George
.
<EOS>
I
call
upon
you
to
assist
me
in
the
apprehension
of
this
person
.
<EOS>
You
'll
be
answerable
for
his
escape
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Wood
,
I
command
you
not
to
stir
,
"
<EOS>
vociferated
the
carpenter
's
better
-
half
;
"
recollect
you
'll
be
answerable
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
declare
I
do
n't
know
what
to
do
,
"
said
Wood
,
burned
by
conflicting
emotions
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Kneebone
!
<EOS>
you
would
greatly
oblige
me
by
surrendering
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
!
"
replied
the
woollen
-
draper
;
"
and
if
that
treacherous
rascal
,
by
your
side
,
does
n't
make
himself
scarce
quickly
,
I
'll
send
a
bullet
through
his
brain
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
death
will
lie
at
your
door
,
"
remarked
Jackson
to
the
carpenter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Show
me
your
warrant
!
"
<EOS>
said
Wood
,
almost
driven
to
his
wit's
-
end
;
"
perhaps
it
is
n't
regular
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ask
him
who
he
is
?
"
suggested
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
good
idea
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
carpenter
.
"
<EOS>
May
I
beg
to
know
whom
I
've
the
pleasure
of
adressing
?
<EOS>
Jackson
,
I
conclude
,
is
merely
an
assumed
name
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
does
it
signify
?
<EOS>
"
returned
the
latter
,
angrily
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
great
deal
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Thames
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
wo
n't
disclose
your
name
,
I
will
for
you
!
<EOS>
You
are
Jonathan
Wild
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Further
concealment
is
needless
,
"
answered
the
other
,
pulling
off
his
wig
and
black
patch
,
and
resuming
his
natural
tone
of
voice
;
"
I
_
am
_
Jonathan
Wild
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Say
you
so
!
"
rejoined
Kneebone
;
"
then
be
this
your
passport
to
eternity
.
"
 
<EOS>
Upon
which
he
drew
the
trigger
of
the
pistol
,
which
,
luckily
for
the
individual
against
whom
it
was
aimed
,
flashed
in
the
pan
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
might
now
send
you
on
a
similar
journey
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Jonathan
,
with
a
bitter
smile
,
and
preserving
the
unmoved
demeanour
he
had
maintained
throughout
;
"
but
I
prefer
conveying
you
,
in
the
first
instance
,
to
Newgate
.
<EOS>
The
Jacobite
daws
want
a
scarecrow
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
sprang
,
with
a
bound
like
that
of
a
tiger
-
cat
,
against
the
throat
of
the
woollen
-
draper
.
<EOS>
And
so
sudden
and
well
-
directed
was
the
assault
,
that
he
completely
overthrew
his
gigantic
antagonist
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lend
a
hand
with
the
ruffles
,
Blueskin
!
"
<EOS>
he
shouted
,
as
that
personage
,
who
had
just
recovered
from
the
stunning
effects
of
the
blow
,
contrived
to
pick
himself
up
.
"
<EOS>
Look
quick
,
d
--
<EOS>
n
you
,
or
<EOS>
we
shall
never
master
him
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Murder
!
"
shrieked
Mrs.
Wood
,
at
the
top
of
her
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
's
a
pistol
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Thames
,
darting
towards
the
undischarged
weapon
dropped
by
Blueskin
in
the
scuffle
,
and
pointing
it
at
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
I
shoot
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
put
it
to
his
ear
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs.
Wood
;
"
that
's
the
surest
way
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
!
no
!
give
it
me
!
"
<EOS>
vociferated
Wood
,
snatching
the
pistol
,
and
rushing
to
the
door
,
against
which
he
placed
his
back
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
soon
settle
this
business
.
<EOS>
Jonathan
Wild
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
in
a
loud
voice
,
"
I
command
you
to
release
your
prisoner
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
I
will
,
"
replied
Jonathan
,
who
,
with
Blueskin
's
aid
,
had
succeeded
in
slipping
a
pair
of
handcuffs
over
the
woollen
-
draper
's
wrists
,
"
when
I
've
Mr.
Walpole
's
order
to
that
effect
--
but
not
before
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
'll
take
the
consequences
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Willingly
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
that
case
I
arrest
you
,
and
your
confederate
,
Joseph
Blake
,
alias
Blueskin
,
on
a
charge
of
felony
,
"
returned
Wood
,
brandishing
his
staff
;
"
resist
my
authority
,
if
you
dare
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
clever
device
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Jonathan
;
"
but
it
wo
n't
serve
your
turn
.
<EOS>
Let
us
pass
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
Strike
the
gag
,
Blueskin
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
stir
a
footstep
.
<EOS>
Open
the
window
,
Thames
,
and
call
for
assistance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Stop
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jonathan
,
who
did
not
care
to
push
matters
too
far
,
"
let
me
have
a
word
with
you
,
Mr.
Wood
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
have
no
explanations
whatever
,
"
replied
the
carpenter
,
disdainfully
,
"
except
before
a
magistrate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
At
least
state
your
charge
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
serious
accusation
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
<EOS>
_
is
_
,
"
answered
Wood
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
recollect
this
key
?
<EOS>
Do
you
recollect
to
whom
you
gave
it
,
and
for
what
purpose
?
<EOS>
or
shall
I
refresh
your
memory
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Wild
appeared
confounded
.
 
<EOS>
"
Release
your
prisoner
,
"
continued
Wood
,
"
or
the
window
is
opened
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Wood
,
"
said
Jonathan
,
advancing
towards
him
,
and
speaking
in
a
low
tone
,
"
the
secret
of
your
adopted
son
's
birth
is
known
to
me
.
<EOS>
The
name
of
his
father
's
murderer
is
also
known
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
can
help
you
to
both,--nay
,
<EOS>
I
_
will
_
help
you
to
both
,
if
you
do
not
interfere
with
my
plans
.
<EOS>
The
arrest
of
this
person
is
of
consequence
to
me
.
<EOS>
Do
not
oppose
it
,
and
I
will
serve
you
.
<EOS>
Thwart
me
,
and
I
become
your
mortal
enemy
.
<EOS>
I
have
but
to
give
a
hint
of
that
boy
's
existence
in
the
proper
quarter
,
and
his
life
will
not
be
worth
a
day
's
purchase
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
listen
to
him
,
father
,
"
cried
Thames
,
unconscious
of
what
was
passing
;
"
there
are
plenty
of
people
outside
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Make
your
choice
,
"
said
Jonathan
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
n't
decide
quickly
,
I
'll
scream
,
"
cried
Mrs.
Wood
,
popping
her
head
through
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
"
Set
your
prisoner
free
!
"
returned
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
off
the
ruffles
,
Blueskin
,
"
rejoined
Wild
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
my
fixed
determination
,
"
he
added
in
a
low
tone
,
as
he
passed
the
carpenter
.
"
<EOS>
Before
to
-
morrow
night
that
boy
shall
join
his
father
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
unlocked
the
door
and
strode
out
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
are
some
letters
,
which
will
let
you
see
what
a
snake
you
've
cherished
in
your
bosom
,
you
uxorious
old
dotard
,
"
said
Blueskin
,
tossing
a
packet
of
papers
to
Wood
,
as
he
followed
his
leader
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Odd's
-
my
-
life
!
<EOS>
what
's
this
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
carpenter
,
looking
at
the
superscription
of
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
this
is
your
writing
Dolly
,
and
addressed
to
Mr.
Kneebone
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
writing
!
<EOS>
no
such
thing
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
the
lady
,
casting
a
look
of
alarm
at
the
woollen
-
draper
.
 
<EOS>
"
Confusion
!
<EOS>
the
rascal
must
have
picked
my
pocket
of
your
letters
,
"
whispered
Kneebone
,
"
What
's
to
be
done
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
to
be
done
!
<EOS>
Why
,
I
'm
undone
!
<EOS>
How
imprudent
in
you
not
to
burn
them
.
<EOS>
But
men
_
are
_
<EOS>
so
careless
,
there
's
no
trusting
anything
to
them
!
<EOS>
However
,
I
must
try
to
brazen
it
out.--Give
me
<EOS>
the
letters
,
my
love
,
"
she
added
aloud
,
and
in
her
most
winning
accents
;
"
they
're
some
wicked
forgeries
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Excuse
me
,
Madam
,
"
replied
the
carpenter
,
turning
his
back
upon
her
,
and
sinking
into
a
chair
:
"
Thames
,
my
love
,
bring
me
my
spectacles
.
<EOS>
My
heart
misgives
me
.
<EOS>
Fool
that
I
was
to
marry
for
beauty
!
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
remembered
that
a
fair
woman
and
a
slashed
gown
always
find
some
nail
in
the
way
.

<EOS>
CHAPTER
VI
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
Step
towards
the
Ladder
.
  
<EOS>
If
there
is
one
thing
on
earth
,
more
lovely
than
another
,
it
is
a
fair
girl
of
the
tender
age
of
Winifred
Wood
!
<EOS>
Her
beauty
awakens
no
feeling
beyond
that
of
admiration
.
<EOS>
The
charm
of
innocence
breathes
around
her
,
as
fragrance
is
diffused
by
the
flower
,
sanctifying
her
lightest
thought
and
action
,
and
shielding
her
,
like
a
spell
,
from
the
approach
of
evil
.
<EOS>
Beautiful
is
the
girl
of
twelve,--who
is
neither
child
nor
woman
,
but
something
between
both
,
something
more
exquisite
than
either
!
 
<EOS>
Such
was
the
fairy
creature
presented
to
Thames
Darrell
,
under
the
following
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
Glad
to
escape
from
the
scene
of
recrimination
that
ensued
between
his
adopted
parents
,
Thames
seized
the
earliest
opportunity
of
retiring
,
and
took
his
way
to
a
small
chamber
in
the
upper
part
of
the
house
,
where
he
and
Jack
were
accustomed
to
spend
most
of
their
leisure
in
the
amusements
,
or
pursuits
,
proper
to
their
years
.
<EOS>
He
found
the
door
ajar
,
and
,
to
his
surprise
,
perceived
little
Winifred
seated
at
a
table
,
busily
engaged
in
tracing
some
design
upon
a
sheet
of
paper
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
hear
his
approach
,
but
continued
her
occupation
without
raising
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
charming
sight
to
watch
the
motions
of
her
tiny
fingers
as
she
pursued
her
task
;
and
though
the
posture
she
adopted
was
not
the
most
favourable
that
might
have
been
chosen
for
the
display
of
her
sylphlike
figure
,
there
was
something
in
her
attitude
,
and
the
glow
of
her
countenance
,
lighted
up
by
the
mellow
radiance
of
the
setting
sun
falling
upon
her
through
the
panes
of
the
little
dormer
-
window
,
that
seemed
to
the
youth
inexpressibly
beautiful
.
<EOS>
Winifred
's
features
would
have
been
pretty
,
for
they
were
regular
and
delicately
formed
,
if
they
had
not
been
slightly
marked
by
the
small
-
pox;--a
disorder
,
that
sometimes
spares
more
than
it
destroys
,
and
imparts
an
expression
to
be
sought
for
in
vain
in
the
smoothest
complexion
.
<EOS>
We
have
seen
pitted
cheeks
,
which
we
would
not
exchange
for
dimples
and
a
satin
skin
.
<EOS>
Winifred
's
face
had
a
thoroughly
amiable
look
.
<EOS>
Her
mouth
was
worthy
of
her
face
;
with
small
,
pearly
-
white
teeth
;
lips
glossy
,
rosy
,
and
pouting
;
and
the
sweetest
smile
imaginable
,
playing
constantly
about
them
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
were
soft
and
blue
,
arched
over
by
dark
brows
,
and
fringed
by
long
silken
lashes
.
<EOS>
Her
hair
was
of
the
darkest
brown
,
and
finest
texture
;
and
,
when
unloosed
,
hung
down
to
her
heels
.
<EOS>
She
was
dressed
in
a
little
white
frock
,
with
a
very
long
body
,
and
very
short
sleeves
,
which
looked
(
from
a
certain
fullness
about
the
hips
,
)
as
if
it
was
intended
to
be
worn
with
a
hoop
.
<EOS>
Her
slender
throat
was
encircled
by
a
black
riband
,
with
a
small
locket
attached
to
it
;
and
upon
the
top
of
her
head
rested
a
diminutive
lace
cap
.
 
<EOS>
The
room
in
which
she
sat
was
a
portion
of
the
garret
,
assigned
,
as
we
have
just
stated
,
by
Mr.
Wood
as
a
play
-
room
to
the
two
boys
;
and
,
like
most
boy
's
playrooms
,
it
exhibited
a
total
absence
of
order
,
or
neatness
.
<EOS>
Things
were
thrown
here
and
there
,
to
be
taken
up
,
or
again
cast
aside
,
as
the
whim
arose
;
while
the
broken
-
backed
chairs
and
crazy
table
bore
the
marks
of
many
a
conflict
.
<EOS>
The
characters
of
the
youthful
occupants
of
the
room
might
be
detected
in
every
article
it
contained
.
<EOS>
Darell
's
peculiar
bent
of
mind
was
exemplified
in
a
rusty
broadsword
,
a
tall
grenadier
's
cap
,
a
musket
without
lock
or
ramrod
,
a
belt
and
cartouch
-
box
,
with
other
matters
evincing
a
decided
military
taste
.
<EOS>
Among
his
books
,
Plutarch
's
Lives
,
and
the
Histories
of
Great
Commanders
,
appeared
to
have
been
frequently
consulted
;
but
the
dust
had
gathered
thickly
upon
the
Carpenter
's
Manual
,
and
a
Treatise
on
Trigonometry
and
Geometry
.
<EOS>
Beneath
the
shelf
,
containing
these
books
,
hung
the
fine
old
ballad
of
'
_
St
.
<EOS>
George
for
England
_
'
and
a
loyal
ditty
,
then
much
in
vogue
,
called
'
_
True
Protestant
Gratitude
,
or
,
Britain
's
Thanksgiving
for
the
First
of
August
,
Being
the
Day
of
His
Majesty
's
Happy
Accession
to
the

<EOS>
Jack
Sheppard
's
library
consisted
of
a
few
ragged
and
well
-
thumbed
volumes
abstracted
from
the
tremendous
chronicles
bequeathed
to
the
world
by
those
Froissarts
and
Holinsheds
of
crime
--
the
Ordinaries
of
Newgate
.
<EOS>
His
vocal
collection
comprised
a
couple
of
flash
songs
pasted
against
the
wall
,
entitled
'
_
<EOS>
The
Thief
-
Catcher
's
Prophecy
_
,
'
and
the
'
_
Life
and
Death
of
the
Darkman
's
Budge
_
;
'
<EOS>
while
his
extraordinary
mechanical
skill
was
displayed
in
what
he
termed
(
Jack
had
a
supreme
contempt
for
orthography
,
)
a
'
_
Moddle
of
his
Ma^{s
}
.
<EOS>
Jale
off
Newgate
_
;
'
another
model
of
the
pillory
at
Fleet
Bridge
;
and
a
third
of
the
permanent
gibbet
at
Tyburn
.
<EOS>
The
latter
specimen
,
of
his
workmanship
was
adorned
with
a
little
scarecrow
figure
,
intended
to
represent
a
housebreaking
chimney
-
sweeper
of
the
time
,
described
in
Sheppard
's
own
hand
-
writing
,
as
'
_
Jack
Hall
a

hanging
_
.
'
<EOS>
We
must
not
omit
to
mention
that
a
family
group
from
the
pencil
of
little
Winifred
,
representing
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Wood
in
very
characteristic
attitudes
,
occupied
a
prominent
place
on
the
walls
.
 
<EOS>
For
a
few
moments
,
Thames
regarded
the
little
girl
through
the
half
-
opened
door
in
silence
.
<EOS>
On
a
sudden
,
a
change
came
over
her
countenance
,
which
,
up
to
this
moment
,
had
worn
a
smiling
and
satisfied
expression
.
<EOS>
Throwing
down
the
pencil
,
she
snatched
up
a
piece
of
India
-
rubber
,
and
exclaiming,--"It
is
n't
at
all
like
him
!
<EOS>
it
is
n't
half
handsome
enough
!
"
<EOS>
was
about
to
efface
the
sketch
,
when
Thames
darted
into
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
is
n't
it
like
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
endeavouring
to
gain
possession
of
the
drawing
,
which
,
af
the
sound
of
his
footstep
,
she
crushed
between
her
fingers
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
tell
you
!
"
<EOS>
she
replied
,
blushing
deeply
,
and
clinching
her
little
hand
as
tightly
as
possible
;
"
it
's
a
secret
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
soon
find
it
out
,
then
<EOS>
,
"
he
returned
,
playfully
forcing
the
paper
from
her
grasp
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
look
at
it
,
I
entreat
,
"
she
cried
.
 
<EOS>
But
her
request
was
unheeded
.
<EOS>
Thames
unfolded
the
drawing
,
smoothed
out
its
creases
,
and
beheld
a
portrait
of
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
a
good
mind
not
to
speak
to
you
again
,
Sir
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Winifred
,
with
difficulty
repressing
a
tear
of
vexation
;
"
you
've
acted
unfairly
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
feel
I
have
,
dear
Winny
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Thames
,
abashed
at
his
own
rudeness
<EOS>
;
"
my
conduct
is
inexcusable
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
excuse
it
nevertheless
,
"
returned
the
little
damsel
,
affectionately
extending
her
hand
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
were
you
afraid
to
show
me
this
picture
,
Winny
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
youth
.
 
<EOS>
"
Because
it
's
not
like
you
,
"
was
her
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
like
or
not
,
I
'm
greatly
pleased
with
it
,
and
must
beg
it
from
you
as
a
memorial----
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Of
what
?
<EOS>
"
she
interrupted
,
startled
by
his
change
of
manner
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
yourself
,
"
he
replied
,
in
a
mournful
tone
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
value
it
highly
,
and
will
promise
never
to
part
with
it
.
<EOS>
Winny
,
this
is
the
last
night
I
shall
pass
beneath
your
father
's
roof
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
told
him
so
?
<EOS>
"
she
inquired
,
reproachfully
.
"
<EOS>
No
;
<EOS>
but
I
shall
,
before
he
retires
to
rest
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
_
will
_
stay
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
clapping
her
hands
joyfully
,
"
for
I
'm
sure
he
wo
n't
part
with
you
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
thank
you
--
thank
you
!
<EOS>
I
'm
so
happy
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Stop
,
Winny
!
"
<EOS>
he
answered
,
gravely
;
"
I
have
n't
promised
yet
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
will,--won't
you
?
<EOS>
"
she
rejoined
,
looking
him
coaxingly
in
the
face
.
 
<EOS>
Unable
to
withstand
this
appeal
,
Thames
gave
the
required
promise
,
adding,--"Oh
!
<EOS>
Winny
,
I
wish
Mr.
Wood
had
been
my
father
,
as
well
as
yours
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
do
I
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
;
"
for
then
you
would
have
been
_
really
_
<EOS>
my
brother
.
<EOS>
No
,
I
do
n't
,
either
;
because----
<EOS>
"
 
"
Well
,
Winny
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
I
was
going
to
say
,
"
she
added
,
in
some
confusion
;
"
<EOS>
only
I
'm
sorry
you
were
born
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
,
I
was
n't
,
"
returned
Thames
,
gloomily
,
as
the
remembrance
of
Jonathan
Wild
's
foul
insinuation
crossed
him
.
"
<EOS>
But
never
mind
who
,
or
what
I
am
.
<EOS>
Give
me
this
picture
.
<EOS>
I
'll
keep
it
for
your
sake
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
give
you
something
better
worth
keeping
,
"
she
answered
,
detaching
the
ornament
from
her
neck
,
and
presenting
it
to
him
;
"
this
contains
a
lock
of
my
hair
,
and
may
remind
you
sometimes
of
your
little
sister
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
picture
,
I
'll
keep
it
myself
,
though
,
if
you
_
do
_
go
<EOS>
I
shall
need
no
memorial
of
_
<EOS>
you
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
I
'd
a
good
many
things
to
say
to
you
,
besides
--
<EOS>
but
you
've
put
them
all
out
of
my
head
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
she
burst
into
tears
,
and
sank
with
her
face
upon
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
Thames
did
not
try
to
cheer
her
.
<EOS>
His
own
heart
was
too
full
of
melancholy
foreboding
.
<EOS>
He
felt
that
he
might
soon
be
separated
--
perhaps
,
for
ever
--
from
the
fond
little
creature
he
held
in
his
arms
,
whom
he
had
always
regarded
with
the
warmest
fraternal
affection
,
and
the
thought
of
how
much
she
would
suffer
from
the
separation
so
sensibly
affected
him
,
that
he
could
not
help
joining
in
her
grief
.
 
<EOS>
From
this
sorrowful
state
he
was
aroused
by
a
loud
derisive
whistle
,
followed
by
a
still
louder
laugh
;
and
,
looking
up
,
he
beheld
the
impudent
countenance
of
Jack
Sheppard
immediately
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Aha
!
"
exclaimed
Jack
,
with
a
roguish
wink
,
<EOS>
"
I
've
caught
<EOS>
you,--have
I
?
"
     
<EOS>
The
carpenter
's
daughter
was
fair
and
free--
    
Fair
,
and
fickle
,
and
false
,
was
she
!
    
<EOS>
She
slighted
the
journeyman
,
(
meaning
_
me
!
<EOS>
_
)
    
<EOS>
And
smiled
on
a
gallant
of
high
degree
.
                               
<EOS>
Degree
!
<EOS>
degree
!
    
<EOS>
She
smiled
on
a
gallant
of
high
degree
.
    
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Jack
!
"
exclaimed
Thames
,
angrily
.
 
<EOS>
But
Sheppard
was
not
to
be
silenced
.
<EOS>
He
went
on
with
his
song
,
accompanying
it
with
the
most
ridiculous
grimaces
:
     
<EOS>
"
When
years
were
gone
by
,
she
began
to
rue
    
<EOS>
Her
love
for
the
gentleman
,
(
meaning
_
you
!
<EOS>
_
)
    
<EOS>
'
I
slighted
the
journeyman
fond
,
'
quoth
<EOS>
she
,
    
<EOS>
'
But
where
is
my
gallant
of
high
degree
?
                                
<EOS>
Where
!
<EOS>
where
!
    
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
where
is
my
gallant
of
high
degree
?
'
    
<EOS>
Ho
!
<EOS>
ho
!
<EOS>
ho
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
doing
here
!
"
demanded
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
nothing
at
all
,
"
answered
Jack
,
sneeringly
,
"
though
this
room
's
as
much
mine
as
yours
,
for
that
matter
.
'
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
desire
to
spoil
sport,--not
I.
<EOS>
And
,
if
you
'll
give
me
such
a
smack
of
your
sweet
lips
,
Miss
,
as
you
've
just
given
Thames
,
I
'll
take
myself
off
in
less
than
no
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
answer
to
this
request
was
a
"
smack
"
of
a
very
different
description
,
bestowed
upon
Sheppard
's
outstretched
face
by
the
little
damsel
,
as
she
ran
out
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Odd
's
!
bodikins
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jack
,
rubbing
his
cheek
,
"
I
'm
in
luck
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
'd
rather
have
a
blow
from
the
daughter
than
the
mother
.
<EOS>
I
know
who
hits
hardest
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
what
,
Thames
,
"
he
added
,
flinging
himself
carelessly
into
a
chair
,
"
I
'd
give
my
right
<EOS>
hand,--and
<EOS>
that
's
no
light
offer
for
a
carpenter
's
'
prentice,--if
<EOS>
that
little
minx
were
half
as
fond
of
me
as
she
is
of
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
not
likely
to
be
the
case
,
if
you
go
on
in
this
way
,
"
replied
Thames
,
sharply
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
the
devil
would
you
have
had
me
do!--make
myself
scarce
,
eh
?
<EOS>
You
should
have
tipped
me
the
wink
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
more
of
this
,
"
rejoined
Thames
,
"
or
we
shall
quarrel
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Who
cares
if
we
do
?
"
<EOS>
retorted
Sheppard
,
with
a
look
of
defiance
.
 
<EOS>
"
Jack
,
"
said
the
other
,
sternly
;
"
do
n't
provoke
me
further
,
or
I
'll
give
you
a
thrashing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Two
can
play
at
that
game
,
my
blood
,
"
replied
Sheppard
,
rising
,
and
putting
himself
into
a
posture
of
defence
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
care
of
yourself
,
then
,
"
rejoined
Thames
,
doubling
his
fists
,
and
advancing
towards
him
:
"
though
my
right
arm
's
stiff
,
I
can
use
it
,
as
you
'll
find
.
"
 
<EOS>
Sheppard
was
no
match
for
his
opponent
,
for
,
though
he
possessed
more
science
,
he
was
deficient
in
weight
and
strength
;
and
,
after
a
short
round
,
in
which
he
had
decidedly
the
worst
of
it
,
a
well
-
directed
hit
on
the
_
nob
<EOS>
_
stretched
him
at
full
length
on
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
'll
teach
you
to
keep
a
civil
tongue
in
your
head
for
the
future
,
"
observed
Thames
,
as
he
helped
Jack
to
his
feet
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
mean
to
give
offence
,
"
replied
Sheppard
,
sulkily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
let
me
tell
you
,
it
's
not
a
pleasant
sight
to
see
the
girl
one
likes
in
the
arms
of
another
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
want
another
drubbing
,
I
perceive
,
"
said
Thames
,
frowning
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
do
n't
.
<EOS>
Enough
's
as
good
as
a
feast
of
the
dainties
you
provide
.
<EOS>
I
'll
think
no
more
about
her
.
<EOS>
Save
us
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
as
his
glance
accidentally
alighted
on
the
drawing
,
which
Winifred
had
dropped
in
her
agitation
.
<EOS>
"
Is
this
_
her
_
work
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
"
answered
Thames
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
see
any
likeness
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
I
,
"
returned
Jack
,
bitterly
.
"
<EOS>
Strange
!
"
<EOS>
he
continued
,
as
if
talking
to
himself
.
<EOS>
"
How
very
like
it
is
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
so
strange
,
surely
,
"
laughed
Thames
,
"
that
a
picture
should
resemble
the
person
for
whom
it
's
intended
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
but
<EOS>
it
_
is
_
strange
how
much
it
resembles
somebody
for
whom
it
's
_
<EOS>
not
_
intended
.
<EOS>
It
's
exactly
like
a
miniature
I
have
in
my
pocket
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
miniature
!
<EOS>
Of
whom
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
I
ca
n't
say
,
"
replied
Jack
,
mysteriously
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
I
half
suspect
,
of
your
father
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
father
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Thames
,
in
the
utmost
astonishment
;
"
let
me
see
it
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Here
it
is
,
"
returned
Jack
,
producing
a
small
picture
in
a
case
set
with
brilliants
.
 
<EOS>
Thames
took
it
,
and
beheld
the
portrait
of
a
young
man
,
apparently
--
judging
from
his
attire
--
of
high
rank
,
whose
proud
and
patrician
features
certainly
presented
a
very
striking
resemblance
to
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
right
Jack
,
"
he
said
,
after
a
pause
,
during
which
he
contemplated
the
picture
with
the
most
fixed
attention
:
"
this
must
have
been
my
father
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
of
it
,
"
answered
Sheppard
;
"
only
compare
it
with
Winny
's
drawing
,
and
you
'll
find
they
're
as
like
as
two
peas
in
a
pod
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Where
did
you
get
it
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
"
From
Lady
Trafford
's
,
where
I
took
the
box
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Surely
,
you
have
n't
stolen
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Stolen
's
an
awkward
word
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
you
perceive
,
I
brought
it
away
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
restored
instantly,--be
<EOS>
the
consequences
what
they
may
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
not
going
to
betray
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jack
,
in
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
,
"
replied
Thames
;
"
but
I
insist
upon
your
taking
it
back
at
once
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Take
it
back
yourself
,
"
retorted
Jack
,
sullenly
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
do
no
such
thing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
replied
Thames
,
about
to
depart
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stop
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Jack
,
planting
himself
before
the
door
;
"
do
you
want
to
get
me
sent
across
the
water
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
save
you
from
disgrace
and
ruin
,
"
returned
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bah
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jack
,
contemptuously
;
"
nobody
's
disgraced
and
ruined
unless
he
's
found
out
.
<EOS>
I
'm
safe
enough
if
you
hold
your
tongue
.
<EOS>
Give
me
that
picture
,
or
I
'll
make
you
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hear
me
,
"
said
Thames
,
calmly
;
<EOS>
"
you
well
know
you
're
no
match
for
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
at
fisticuffs
,
perhaps
,
"
interrupted
Jack
,
fiercely
;
"
but
I
've
my
knife
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
dare
n't
use
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Try
to
leave
the
room
,
and
see
whether
I
dare
n't
,
"
returned
Jack
,
opening
the
blade
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
expect
this
from
you
,
"
rejoined
Thames
,
resolutely
.
"
<EOS>
But
your
threats
wo
n't
prevent
my
leaving
the
room
when
I
please
,
and
as
I
please
.
<EOS>
Now
,
will
you
stand
aside
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
,
"
answered
Jack
,
obstinately
.
 
<EOS>
Thames
said
not
another
word
,
but
marched
boldly
towards
him
,
and
seized
him
by
the
collar
.
 
<EOS>
"
Leave
go
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jack
,
struggling
violently
,
and
raising
his
hand
,
"
or
I
'll
maul
you
for
life
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
But
Thames
was
not
to
be
deterred
from
his
purpose
;
and
the
strife
might
have
terminated
seriously
,
if
a
peace
-
maker
had
not
appeared
in
the
shape
of
little
Winifred
,
who
,
alarmed
by
the
noise
,
rushed
suddenly
into
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
she
screamed
,
seeing
the
uplifted
weapon
in
Sheppard
's
hand
,
"
do
n't
hurt
Thames
--
don't
,
dear
Jack
!
<EOS>
If
you
want
to
kill
somebody
,
kill
me
,
not
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
she
flung
herself
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
dropped
the
knife
,
and
walked
sullenly
aside
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
has
caused
this
quarrel
,
Thames
?
"
asked
the
little
girl
,
anxiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
,
"
answered
Jack
,
abruptly
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
such
thing
,
"
rejoined
Thames
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
all
about
it
presently
.
<EOS>
But
you
must
leave
us
now
,
<EOS>
dear
Winny
,
Jack
and
I
have
something
to
settle
between
ourselves
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
afraid
.
<EOS>
Our
quarrel
's
quite
over
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
sure
of
that
?
"
returned
Winifred
,
looking
uneasily
at
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
"
rejoined
Sheppard
;
"
he
may
do
what
he
pleases,--hang
me
,
if
he
thinks
proper,--if
<EOS>
_
you
_
wish
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
assurance
,
and
at
the
reiterated
request
of
Thames
,
the
little
girl
reluctantly
withdrew
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
Jack
,
"
said
Thames
,
walking
up
to
Sheppard
,
and
taking
his
hand
,
"
have
done
with
this
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
once
more
,
I
'll
say
and
do
nothing
to
get
you
into
trouble
.
<EOS>
Best
assured
of
that
.
<EOS>
But
I
'm
resolved
to
see
Lady
Trafford
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
she
may
tell
me
whose
picture
this
is
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
she
may
,
"
returned
Jack
,
brightening
up
;
"
it
's
a
good
idea
.
<EOS>
I
'll
go
with
you
.
<EOS>
But
you
must
see
her
alone
;
and
that
'll
be
no
easy
matter
to
manage
,
for
she
's
a
great
invalid
,
and
has
generally
somebody
with
her
.
<EOS>
Above
all
,
beware
of
Sir
Rowland
Trenchard
.
<EOS>
He
's
as
savage
and
suspicious
as
the
devil
himself
.
<EOS>
I
should
never
have
noticed
the
miniature
at
all
,
if
it
had
n't
been
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
standing
by
,
rating
her
<EOS>
ladyship,--who
can
scarcely
stir
from
the
sofa,--while
I
was
packing
up
her
jewels
in
the
case
,
and
I
observed
that
she
tried
to
hide
a
small
casket
from
him
.
<EOS>
His
back
was
no
sooner
turned
,
than
she
slipped
this
casket
into
the
box
.
<EOS>
The
next
minute
,
I
contrived
,
without
either
of
'em
perceiving
me
,
to
convey
it
into
my
own
pocket
.
<EOS>
I
was
sorry
for
what
I
did
afterwards
;
for
,
I
do
n't
know
why
,
but
,
poor
,
lady
!
<EOS>
with
her
pale
face
,
and
black
eyes
,
she
reminded
me
of
my
mother
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
,
alone
,
ought
to
have
prevented
you
from
acting
as
you
did
,
Jack
,
"
returned
Thames
,
gravely
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
never
have
acted
as
I
did
,
"
rejoined
Sheppard
,
bitterly
;
"
if
Mrs.
Wood
had
n't
struck
me
.
<EOS>
That
blow
made
me
a
thief
.
<EOS>
And
,
if
ever
I
'm
brought
to
the
gallows
,
I
shall
lay
my
death
at
her
door
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
think
no
more
about
it
,
"
returned
Thames
.
<EOS>
"
Do
better
in
future
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
when
I
've
had
my
revenge
,
"
muttered
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
take
my
advice
,
and
keep
out
of
Sir
Rowland
's
way
,
or
you
'll
get
the
poor
lady
into
trouble
as
well
as
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
fear
,
"
replied
Thames
,
taking
up
his
hat
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
let
's
be
off
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
two
boys
,
then
,
emerged
upon
the
landing
,
and
were
about
to
descend
the
stairs
,
when
the
voices
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Wood
resounded
from
below
.
<EOS>
The
storm
appeared
to
have
blown
over
,
for
they
were
conversing
in
a
very
amicable
manner
with
Mr.
Kneebone
,
who
was
on
the
point
of
departing
.
 
<EOS>
"
Quite
sorry
,
my
good
friend
<EOS>
,
there
should
have
been
any
misunderstanding
between
us
,
"
observed
the
woollen
-
draper
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
mention
it
,
"
returned
Wood
,
in
the
conciliatory
tone
of
one
who
admits
he
has
been
in
the
wrong
;
"
your
explanation
is
perfectly
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
expect
you
to
-
morrow
,
"
insinuated
Mrs.
Wood
;
"
and
pray
,
do
n't
bring
anybody
with
you,--especially
Jonathan
Wild
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
fear
of
that
,
"
laughed
Kneebone.--"Oh
!
<EOS>
about
that
boy
,
Thames
Darrell
.
<EOS>
His
safety
must
be
looked
to
.
<EOS>
Jonathan
's
threats
are
not
to
be
sneezed
at
.
<EOS>
The
rascal
will
be
at
work
before
the
morning
.
<EOS>
Keep
your
eye
upon
the
lad
.
<EOS>
And
mind
he
does
n't
stir
out
of
your
sight
,
on
any
pretence
whatever
,
till
I
call
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
hear
that
,
"
whispered
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
replied
Thames
,
in
the
same
tone
;
"
we
have
n't
a
moment
to
lose
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Take
care
of
yourself
,
"
said
Mr.
Wood
,
"
and
I
'll
take
care
of
Thames
.
<EOS>
It
's
never
a
bad
day
that
has
a
good
ending
.
<EOS>
Good
night
!
<EOS>
God
bless
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
there
was
a
great
shaking
of
hands
,
with
renewed
apologies
and
protestations
of
friendship
on
both
sides
;
after
which
Mr.
Kneebone
took
his
leave
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
,
you
really
suspected
me
?
"
<EOS>
murmured
Mrs.
Wood
,
reproachfully
,
as
they
returned
to
the
parlour
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
you
men
!
<EOS>
you
men
!
<EOS>
Once
get
a
thing
into
your
head
,
and
nothing
will
beat
it
out
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
my
love
,
"
rejoined
her
husband
,
"
appearances
,
you
must
allow
,
were
a
little
against
you
.
<EOS>
But
since
you
assure
me
_
you
_
did
n't
write
the
letters
,
and
Mr.
Kneebone
assures
me
_
<EOS>
he
_
did
n't
receive
them
<EOS>
,
I
ca
n't
do
otherwise
than
believe
you
.
<EOS>
And
I
've
made
up
my
mind
that
a
husband
ought
to
believe
only
half
that
he
hears
,
and
nothing
that
he
sees
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
An
excellent
maxim
!
<EOS>
"
replied
his
wife
,
approvingly
;
"
the
best
I
ever
heard
you
utter
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
now
go
and
look
after
Thames
,
"
observed
the
carpenter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
never
mind
him
:
he
'll
take
no
harm
!
<EOS>
Come
with
me
into
the
parlour
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
spare
you
at
present
.
<EOS>
Heigho
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Now
for
it
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jack
,
as
the
couple
entered
the
room
:
"
the
coast
's
clear
.
"
 
<EOS>
Thames
was
about
to
follow
,
when
he
felt
a
gentle
grasp
upon
his
arm
.
<EOS>
He
turned
,
and
beheld
Winifred
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
are
you
going
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
back
presently
,
"
replied
Thames
,
evasively
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
go
,
I
beg
of
you
!
"
<EOS>
she
implored
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
in
danger
.
<EOS>
I
overheard
what
Mr.
Kneebone
said
,
just
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Death
and
the
devil
!
<EOS>
what
a
cursed
interruption
!
"
cried
Jack
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
loiter
in
this
way
,
old
Wood
will
catch
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
stir
,
I
'll
call
him
!
"
<EOS>
rejoined
Winifred
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
you
,
Jack
,
who
are
persuading
my
brother
to
do
wrong
.
<EOS>
Thames
,
"
she
urged
,
"
the
errand
,
on
which
you
're
going
,
ca
n't
be
for
any
good
,
or
you
would
n't
be
afraid
of
mentioning
it
to
my
father
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
coming
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jack
,
stamping
his
foot
,
with
vexation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Another
moment
,
and
it
'll
be
too
late
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Winny
,
I
_
must
_
go
!
"
<EOS>
said
Thames
,
breaking
from
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stay
,
dear
Thames!--stay
!
"
cried
the
little
girl
.
"
<EOS>
He
hears
me
not
!
<EOS>
he
's
gone
!
"
<EOS>
she
added
,
<EOS>
as
the
door
was
opened
and
shut
with
violence
;
"
something
tells
me
I
shall
never
see
him
again
!
"
 
<EOS>
When
her
father
,
a
moment
afterwards
,
issued
from
the
parlour
to
ascertain
the
cause
of
the
noise
,
he
found
her
seated
on
the
stairs
,
in
an
agony
of
grief
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
's
Thames
?
<EOS>
"
he
hastily
inquired
.
 
<EOS>
Winifred
pointed
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
speak
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
Jack
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Gone
too
,
"
sobbed
his
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Wood
uttered
something
like
an
imprecation
.
 
<EOS>
"
God
forgive
me
for
using
such
a
word
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
in
a
troubled
tone
;
"
if
I
had
n't
yielded
to
my
wife
's
silly
request
,
this
would
n't
have
happened

CHAPTER
VII
.
 
<EOS>
Brother
and
Sister
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
same
evening
,
in
a
stately
chamber
of
a
noble
old
mansion
of
Elizabeth
's
time
,
situated
in
Southampton
Fields
,
two
persons
were
seated
.
<EOS>
One
of
these
,
a
lady
,
evidently
a
confirmed
invalid
,
and
attired
in
deep
mourning
,
reclined
upon
a
sort
of
couch
,
or
easy
chair
,
set
on
wheels
,
with
her
head
supported
by
cushions
,
and
her
feet
resting
upon
a
velvet
footstool
.
<EOS>
A
crutch
,
with
a
silver
handle
,
stood
by
her
side
,
proving
the
state
of
extreme
debility
to
which
she
was
reduced
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
easy
matter
to
determine
her
age
,
for
,
though
she
still
retained
a
certain
youthfulness
of
appearance
,
she
had
many
marks
in
her
countenance
,
usually
indicating
the
decline
of
life
,
but
which
in
her
case
were
,
no
doubt
,
the
result
of
constant
and
severe
indisposition
.
<EOS>
Her
complexion
was
wan
and
faded
,
except
where
it
was
tinged
by
a
slight
hectic
flush
,
that
made
the
want
of
colour
more
palpable
;
her
eyes
were
large
and
black
,
but
heavy
and
lustreless
;
her
cheeks
sunken
;
her
frame
emaciated
;
her
dark
hair
thickly
scattered
with
gray
.
<EOS>
When
younger
,
and
in
better
health
,
she
must
have
been
eminently
lovely
;
and
there
were
still
the
remains
of
great
beauty
about
her
.
<EOS>
The
expression
,
however
,
which
would
chiefly
have
interested
a
beholder
,
was
that
of
settled
and
profound
melancholy
.
 
<EOS>
Her
companion
was
a
person
of
no
inferior
condition
.
<EOS>
Indeed
it
was
apparent
,
from
the
likeness
between
them
,
that
they
were
nearly
related
.
<EOS>
He
had
the
same
dark
eyes
,
though
lighted
by
a
fierce
flame
;
the
same
sallow
complexion
;
the
same
tall
,
thin
figure
,
and
majestic
demeanour
;
the
same
proud
cast
of
features
.
<EOS>
But
here
the
resemblance
stopped
.
<EOS>
The
expression
was
wholly
different
.
<EOS>
He
looked
melancholy
enough
,
it
is
true
.
<EOS>
But
his
gloom
appeared
to
be
occasioned
by
remorse
,
rather
than
sorrow
.
<EOS>
No
sterner
head
was
ever
beheld
beneath
the
cowl
of
a
monk
,
or
the
bonnet
of
an
inquisitor
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
inexorable
,
and
inscrutable
as
fate
itself
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Lady
Trafford
,
"
he
said
,
fixing
a
severe
look
upon
her
.
<EOS>
"
You
depart
for
Lancashire
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Have
I
your
final
answer
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
,
Sir
Rowland
,
"
she
answered
,
in
a
feeble
tone
,
but
firmly
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
the
sum
you
require
,
but----
"
 
"
But
what
,
Madam
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
misunderstand
me
,
"
she
proceeded
.
<EOS>
"
I
give
it
to
King
James
--
<EOS>
not
so
you
:
for
the
furtherance
of
a
great
and
holy
cause
,
not
for
the
prosecution
of
wild
and
unprofitable
schemes
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Sir
Rowland
bit
his
lips
to
repress
the
answer
that
rose
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
the
will
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
with
forced
calmness
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
still
refuse
to
make
one
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
_
have
_
made
one
,
"
replied
Lady
Trafford
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
?
"
cried
her
brother
,
starting
.
 
<EOS>
"
Rowland
,
"
she
rejoined
,
"
you
strive
in
vain
to
terrify
me
into
compliance
with
your
wishes
.
<EOS>
Nothing
shall
induce
me
to
act
contrary
to
the
dictates
of
my
conscience
.
<EOS>
My
will
is
executed
,
and
placed
in
safe
custody
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
whose
favour
is
it
made
?
<EOS>
"
he
inquired
,
sternly
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
favour
of
my
son
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
son
,
"
rejoined
Sir
Rowland
,
moodily
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
_
had
_
one
,
"
answered
his
sister
,
in
a
mournful
voice
;
"
and
,
perhaps
,
I
have
one
still
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
thought
so--
"
cried
the
knight
fiercely
;
"
but
this
is
idle
,
"
he
added
,
suddenly
checking
himself
.
"
<EOS>
Aliva
,
your
child
perished
with
its
father
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
by
whom
were
they
both
destroyed
?
"
demanded
his
sister
,
raising
herself
by
a
painful
effort
,
and
regarding
him
with
a
searching
glance
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
the
avenger
of
his
family
's
dishonour
--
by
your
brother
,
"
he
replied
,
coolly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Brother
,
"
cried
Lady
Trafford
,
her
eye
blazing
with
unnatural
light
,
and
her
cheek
suffused
with
a
crimson
stain
:
<EOS>
"
Brother
,
"
she
cried
,
lifting
her
thin
fingers
towards
Heaven
,
"
as
God
shall
judge
me
<EOS>
,
I
was
wedded
to
that
murdered
man
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
lie
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Sir
Rowland
,
furiously
;
"
a
black
,
and
damning
lie
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
truth
,
"
replied
his
sister
,
falling
backwards
upon
the
couch
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
swear
it
upon
the
cross
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
His
name
,
then
?
"
demanded
the
knight
.
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
that
,
and
I
will
believe
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
now
--
not
now
!
<EOS>
"
she
returned
,
with
a
shudder
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
am
dead
you
will
learn
it
.
<EOS>
Do
not
disquiet
yourself
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
have
to
wait
long
for
the
information
.
<EOS>
Rowland
,
"
she
added
,
in
an
altered
tone
,
"
I
am
certain
I
shall
not
live
many
days
.
<EOS>
And
if
you
treat
me
in
this
way
,
you
will
have
my
death
to
answer
for
,
as
well
as
the
deaths
of
my
husband
and
child
.
<EOS>
Let
us
part
in
peace
.
<EOS>
We
shall
take
an
eternal
farewell
of
each
other
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Be
it
so
!
"
<EOS>
rejoined
Sir
Rowland
,
with
concentrated
fury
;
"
but
before
we
_
do
_
part
,
I
am
resolved
to
know
the
name
of
your
pretended
husband
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Torture
shall
not
wrest
it
from
me
,
"
answered
his
sister
,
firmly
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
motive
have
you
for
concealment
?
<EOS>
"
he
demanded
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
vow
,
"
she
answered,--"a
vow
to
my
dead
husband
.
"
 
<EOS>
Sir
Rowland
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
,
as
if
he
meditated
some
terrible
reply
.
<EOS>
He
then
arose
,
and
,
taking
a
few
turns
in
the
chamber
,
stopped
suddenly
before
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
has
put
it
into
your
head
that
your
son
yet
lives
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
dreamed
that
I
shall
see
him
before
I
die
,
"
she
rejoined
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dreamed
!
"
echoed
the
knight
,
with
a
ghastly
smile
.
<EOS>
"
Is
that
all
?
<EOS>
Then
learn
from
me
that
your
hopes
are
visionary
as
their
foundation
.
<EOS>
Unless
he
can
arise
from
the
bottom
of
the
Thames
,
where
he
and
his
abhorred
father
lie
buried
,
you
will
never
behold
him
again
in
this
world
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Heaven
have
compassion
on
you
,
Rowland
!
"
<EOS>
murmured
his
sister
,
crossing
her
hands
and
looking
upwards
;
"
you
have
none
on
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
_
will
_
have
none
till
I
have
forced
the
villain
's
name
from
you
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
stamping
the
floor
with
rage
.
 
<EOS>
"
Rowland
,
your
violence
is
killing
me
,
"
she
returned
,
in
a
plaintive
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
His
name
,
I
say!--his
name
!
"
thundered
the
knight
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
unsheathed
his
sword
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Trafford
uttered
a
prolonged
scream
,
and
fainted
.
<EOS>
When
she
came
to
herself
,
she
found
that
her
brother
had
quitted
the
room
,
leaving
her
to
the
care
of
a
female
attendant
.
<EOS>
Her
first
orders
were
to
summon
the
rest
of
her
servants
to
make
immediate
preparations
for
her
departure
for
Lancashire
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
-
night
,
your
ladyship
?
"
ventured
an
elderly
domestic
.
 
<EOS>
"
Instantly
,
Hobson
,
"
returned
Lady
Trafford
;
"
as
soon
as
the
carriage
can
be
brought
round
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
shall
be
at
the
door
in
ten
minutes
.
<EOS>
Has
your
ladyship
any
further
commands
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
None
whatever
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
stay
!
<EOS>
There
is
one
thing
I
wish
you
to
do
.
<EOS>
Take
that
box
,
and
put
it
into
the
carriage
yourself
.
<EOS>
Where
is
Sir
Rowland
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
the
library
,
your
ladyship
.
<EOS>
He
has
given
orders
that
no
one
is
to
disturb
him
.
<EOS>
But
there
's
a
person
in
the
hall
--
a
very
odd
sort
of
man
--
waiting
to
see
him
,
who
wo
n't
be
sent
away
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Very
well
.
<EOS>
Lose
not
a
moment
,
Hobson
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
elderly
domestic
bowed
,
took
up
the
case
,
and
retired
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
ladyship
is
far
too
unwell
to
travel
,
"
remarked
the
female
attendant
,
assisting
her
to
rise
;
"
you
'll
never
be
able
to
reach
Manchester
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
matters
not
,
Norris
,
"
replied
Lady
Trafford
:
"
I
would
rather
die
on
the
road
,
than
be
exposed
to
another
such
scene
as
I
have
just
encountered
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
sympathised
Mrs.
Norris
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
afraid
from
the
scream
I
heard
,
that
something
dreadful
had
happened
,
Sir
Rowland
has
a
terrible
temper
indeed
--
a
shocking
temper
!
<EOS>
I
declare
he
frightens
me
out
of
my
senses
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
Rowland
is
my
brother
,
"
resumed
Lady
Trafford
coldly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
that
's
no
reason
why
he
should
treat
your
ladyship
so
shamefully
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sure
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
how
I
wish
,
poor
dear
Sir
Cecil
were
alive
!
<EOS>
he
'd
keep
him
in
order
.
"
 
<EOS>
Lady
Trafford
sighed
deeply
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
ladyship
has
never
been
well
since
you
married
Sir
Cecil
,
"
rejoined
Mrs.
Norris
.
<EOS>
"
For
my
part
,
I
do
n't
think
you
ever
quite
got
over
the
accident
you
met
with
on
the
night
of
the
Great
Storm
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Norris
!
"
<EOS>
gasped
Lady
Trafford
,
trembling
violently
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mercy
on
us
!
<EOS>
what
have
I
said
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
attendant
,
greatly
alarmed
by
the
agitation
of
her
mistress
;
"
do
sit
down
,
your
ladyship
,
while
I
run
for
the
ratifia
and
rosa
solis
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
past
,
"
rejoined
Lady
Trafford
,
recovering
herself
by
a
powerful
effort
;
"
but
never
allude
to
the
circumstance
again
.
<EOS>
Go
and
prepare
for
our
departure
.
"
 
<EOS>
In
less
time
than
Hobson
had
mentioned
,
the
carriage
was
announced
.
<EOS>
And
Lady
Trafford
having
been
carried
down
stairs
,
and
placed
within
it
,
the
postboy
drove
off
,
at
a
rapid
pace
for
Barnet
.

CHAPTER
VIII
.
 
<EOS>
Miching
Mallecho
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Rowland
,
meantime
,
paced
his
chamber
with
a
quick
and
agitated
step
.
<EOS>
He
was
ill
at
ease
,
though
he
would
not
have
confessed
his
disquietude
even
to
himself
.
<EOS>
Not
conceiving
that
his
sister
--
feeble
as
she
was
,
and
yielding
as
she
had
ever
shown
herself
to
his
wishes
,
whether
expressed
or
implied
--
would
depart
without
consulting
him
,
he
was
equally
surprised
and
enraged
to
hear
the
servants
busied
in
transporting
her
to
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
His
pride
,
however
,
would
not
suffer
him
to
interfere
with
their
proceedings
;
much
less
could
he
bring
himself
to
acknowledge
that
he
had
been
in
the
wrong
,
and
entreat
Lady
Trafford
to
remain
,
though
he
was
well
aware
that
her
life
might
be
endangered
if
she
travelled
by
night
.
<EOS>
But
,
when
the
sound
of
the
carriage
-
wheels
died
away
,
and
he
felt
that
she
was
actually
gone
,
his
resolution
failed
him
,
and
he
rang
the
bell
violently
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
horses
,
Charcam
,
"
he
said
,
as
a
servant
appeared
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
lingered
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Sdeath
!
<EOS>
why
am
I
not
obeyed
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
knight
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
overtake
Lady
Trafford
.
<EOS>
Use
despatch
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Her
ladyship
will
not
travel
beyond
Saint
Alban
's
to
-
night
,
Sir
Rowland
,
so
Mrs.
Norris
informed
me
,
"
returned
Charcam
,
respectfully
;
"
and
there
's
a
person
without
,
anxious
for
an
audience
,
whom
,
with
submission
,
I
think
your
honour
would
desire
to
see
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
exclaimed
Sir
Rowland
,
glancing
significantly
at
Charcam
,
who
was
a
confidant
in
his
Jacobite
schemes
;
"
is
it
the
messenger
from
Orchard
-
Windham
,
from
Sir
William
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
Sir
Rowland
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
From
Mr.
Corbet
Kynaston
,
then
?
<EOS>
Sir
John
Packington
's
courier
was
here
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
Sir
Rowland
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
he
is
from
Lord
Derwentwater
,
or
Mr.
Forster
?
<EOS>
News
_
is
_
expected
from
Northumberland
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
exactly
say
,
Sir
Rowland
.
<EOS>
The
gentleman
did
n't
communicate
his
business
to
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
'm
sure
it
's
important
.
"
 
<EOS>
Charcam
said
this
,
not
because
he
knew
anything
about
the
matter
;
but
,
having
received
a
couple
of
guineas
to
deliver
the
message
,
he
,
naturally
enough
,
estimated
its
importance
by
the
amount
of
the
gratuity
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
will
see
him
,
"
replied
the
knight
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
;
"
he
may
be
from
the
Earl
of
Mar.
But
let
the
horses
be
in
readiness
.
<EOS>
I
shall
ride
to
St.
Alban
's
to
-
night
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
threw
himself
into
a
chair
.
<EOS>
And
Charcam
,
fearful
of
another
charge
in
his
master
's
present
uncertain
mood
,
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
The
person
,
shortly
afterwards
ushered
into
the
room
,
seemed
by
the
imperfect
<EOS>
light,--for
the
evening
was
advancing
,
and
the
chamber
darkened
by
heavy
drapery,--to
be
a
middle
-
sized
middle
-
aged
man
,
of
rather
vulgar
appearance
,
but
with
a
very
shrewd
aspect
.
<EOS>
He
was
plainly
attired
in
a
riding
-
dress
and
boots
of
the
period
,
and
wore
a
hanger
by
his
side
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
servant
,
Sir
Rowland
,
"
said
the
stranger
,
ducking
his
head
,
as
he
advanced
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
business
,
Sir
?
"
returned
the
other
,
stiffly
.
 
<EOS>
The
new
-
comer
looked
at
Charcam
.
<EOS>
Sir
Rowland
waved
his
hand
,
and
the
attendant
withdrew
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
recollect
me
,
I
presume
?
<EOS>
"
premised
the
stranger
,
taking
a
seat
.
 
<EOS>
The
knight
,
who
could
ill
brook
this
familiarity
,
instantly
arose
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
disturb
yourself
,
"
continued
the
other
,
nowise
disconcerted
by
the
rebuke
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
stand
upon
ceremony
where
I
know
I
shall
be
welcome
.
<EOS>
We
_
have
_
met
before
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
<EOS>
"
rejoined
Sir
Rowland
,
haughtily
;
"
perhaps
,
you
will
refresh
my
memory
as
to
the
time
,
and
place
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
.
<EOS>
The
time
was
the
26th
of
November
,
1703
:
the
place
,
the
Mint
in
Southwark
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
good
memory
,
you
perceive
,
Sir
Rowland
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
knight
staggered
as
if
struck
by
a
mortal
wound
.
<EOS>
Speedily
recovering
himself
,
however
,
he
rejoined
,
with
forced
calmness
,
"
<EOS>
You
are
mistaken
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
I
was
in
Lancashire
,
at
our
family
seat
,
at
the
time
you
mention
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
stranger
smiled
incredulously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sir
Rowland
,
"
he
said
,
after
a
brief
pause
,
during
which
the
knight
regarded
him
with
a
searching
glance
,
as
if
endeavouring
to
recall
his
features
,
"
I
will
not
gainsay
your
words
.
<EOS>
You
are
in
the
right
to
be
cautious
,
till
you
know
with
whom
you
have
to
deal
;
and
,
even
then
,
you
ca
n't
be
too
wary
.
'
<EOS>
Avow
nothing
,
believe
nothing
,
give
nothing
for
nothing
,
'
is
my
own
motto
.
<EOS>
And
it
's
a
maxim
of
universal
application
:
or
,
at
least
,
of
universal
practice
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
come
here
to
play
the
part
of
your
father
-
confessor
.
<EOS>
I
am
come
to
serve
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
what
way
,
Sir
?
"
demanded
Trenchard
,
in
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
learn
anon
.
<EOS>
You
refuse
me
your
confidence
.
<EOS>
I
applaud
your
prudence
:
it
is
,
however
,
needless
.
<EOS>
Your
history
,
your
actions
,
nay
,
your
very
thoughts
are
better
known
to
me
than
to
your
spiritual
adviser
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Make
good
your
assertions
,
"
cried
Trenchard
,
furiously
,
"
or----
<EOS>
"
 
"
To
the
proof
,
"
interrupted
the
stranger
,
calmly
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
the
son
of
Sir
Montacute
Trenchard
,
of
Ashton
-
Hall
,
near
Manchester
.
<EOS>
Sir
Montacute
had
three
children
--
two
daughters
and
yourself
.
<EOS>
The
eldest
,
Constance
,
was
lost
,
by
the
carelessness
of
a
servant
,
during
her
infancy
,
and
has
never
since
been
heard
of
:
the
youngest
,
Aliva
,
is
the
present
Lady
Trafford
.
<EOS>
I
merely
mention
these
circumstances
to
show
the
accuracy
of
my
information
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
this
is
the
extent
of
it
,
Sir
,
"
returned
the
knight
,
ironically
,
"
you
may
spare
yourself
further
trouble
.
<EOS>
These
particulars
are
familiar
to
all
,
who
have
any
title
to
the
knowledge
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
so
,
"
rejoined
the
stranger
;
"
but
I
have
others
in
reserve
,
not
so
generally
known
.
<EOS>
With
your
permission
,
I
will
go
on
in
my
own
way
.
<EOS>
Where
I
am
in
error
,
you
can
set
me
<EOS>
right.--Your
father
,
Sir
Montacute
Trenchard
,
who
had
been
a
loyal
subject
of
King
James
the
Second
,
and
borne
arms
in
his
service
,
on
the
abdication
of
that
monarch
,
turned
his
back
upon
the
Stuarts
,
and
would
never
afterwards
recognise
their
claims
to
the
crown
.
<EOS>
It
was
said
,
that
he
received
an
affront
from
James
,
in
the
shape
of
a
public
reprimand
,
which
his
pride
could
not
forgive
.
<EOS>
Be
this
as
it
may
,
though
a
Catholic
,
he
died
a
friend
to
the
Protestant
succession
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
far
you
are
correct
,
"
observed
Trenchard
;
"
still
,
this
is
no
secret
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Suffer
me
to
proceed
,
"
replied
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
opinions
,
entertained
by
the
old
knight
,
naturally
induced
him
to
view
with
displeasure
the
conduct
of
his
son
,
who
warmly
espoused
the
cause
he
had
deserted
.
<EOS>
Finding
remonstrances
of
no
avail
,
he
had
recourse
to
threats
;
and
when
threats
failed
,
he
adopted
more
decided
measures
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
"
ejaculated
Trenchard
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
yet
,
"
pursued
the
stranger
,
"
Sir
Montacute
had
placed
no
limit
to
his
son
's
expenditure
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
quarrel
with
Rowland
's
profusion
,
for
his
own
revenues
were
ample
;
but
he
_
did
_
object
to
the
large
sums
lavished
by
him
in
the
service
of
a
faction
he
was
resolved
not
to
support
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
the
old
knight
reduced
his
son
's
allowance
to
a
third
of
its
previous
amount
;
and
,
upon
further
provocation
,
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
alter
his
will
in
favour
of
his
daughter
,
Aliva
,
who
was
then
betrothed
to
her
cousin
,
Sir
Cecil
Trafford
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Proceed
,
Sir
,
"
said
Trenchard
,
breathing
hard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Under
these
circumstances
,
Rowland
did
what
any
other
sensible
person
would
do
.
<EOS>
Aware
of
his
father
's
inflexibility
of
purpose
,
he
set
his
wits
to
work
to
defeat
the
design
.
<EOS>
He
contrived
to
break
off
his
sister
's
match
;
and
this
he
accomplished
so
cleverly
,
that
he
maintained
the
strictest
friendship
with
Sir
Cecil
.
<EOS>
For
two
years
he
thought
himself
secure
;
and
,
secretly
engaged
in
the
Jacobite
schemes
of
the
time
,
in
which
,
also
,
Sir
Cecil
was
deeply
involved
,
he
began
to
relax
in
his
watchfulness
over
Aliva
.
<EOS>
About
this
time,--namely
,
in
November
,
1703
-
-while
young
Trenchard
was
in
Lancashire
,
and
his
sister
in
London
,
on
a
visit
,
he
received
a
certain
communication
from
his
confidential
servant
,
Davies
,
which
,
at
once
,
destroyed
his
hopes
.
<EOS>
He
learnt
that
his
sister
was
privately
married
--
the
name
or
rank
of
her
husband
could
not
be
ascertained
--
and
living
in
retirement
in
an
obscure
dwelling
in
the
Borough
,
where
she
had
given
birth
to
a
son
.
<EOS>
Rowland
's
plans
were
quickly
formed
,
and
as
quickly
executed
.
<EOS>
Accompanied
by
Sir
Cecil
,
who
still
continued
passionately
enamoured
of
his
sister
,
and
to
whom
he
represented
that
she
had
fallen
a
victim
to
the
arts
of
a
seducer
,
he
set
off
,
at
fiery
speed
,
for
the
metropolis
.
<EOS>
Arrived
there
,
their
first
object
was
to
seek
out
Davies
,
by
whom
they
were
conducted
to
the
lady
's
retreat,--a
lone
habitation
,
situated
on
the
outskirts
of
Saint
George
's
Fields
in
Southwark
.
<EOS>
Refused
admittance
,
they
broke
open
the
door
.
<EOS>
Aliva
's
husband
,
who
passed
by
the
name
of
Darrell
,
confronted
them
sword
in
hand
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
minutes
he
kept
them
at
bay
.
<EOS>
But
,
urged
by
his
wife
's
cries
,
who
was
more
anxious
for
the
preservation
of
her
child
's
life
than
her
own
,
he
snatched
up
the
infant
,
and
made
his
escape
from
the
back
of
the
premises
.
<EOS>
Rowland
and
his
companions
instantly
started
in
pursuit
,
leaving
the
lady
to
recover
as
she
might
.
<EOS>
They
tracked
the
fugitive
to
the
Mint
;
but
,
like
hounds
at
fault
,
they
here
lost
all
scent
of
their
prey
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
the
lady
had
overtaken
them
;
but
,
terrified
by
the
menaces
of
her
vindictive
kinsmen
,
she
did
not
dare
to
reveal
herself
to
her
husband
,
of
whose
concealment
on
the
roof
of
the
very
house
the
party
were
searching
<EOS>
she
was
aware
.
<EOS>
Aided
by
an
individual
,
who
was
acquainted
with
a
secret
outlet
from
the
tenement
,
Darrell
escaped
.
<EOS>
Before
his
departure
,
he
gave
his
assistant
a
glove
.
<EOS>
That
glove
is
still
preserved
.
<EOS>
In
her
endeavour
to
follow
him
,
Aliva
met
with
a
severe
fall
,
and
was
conveyed
away
,
in
a
state
of
insensibility
,
by
Sir
Cecil
.
<EOS>
She
was
supposed
to
be
lifeless
;
but
she
survived
the
accident
,
though
she
never
regained
her
strength
.
<EOS>
Directed
by
the
same
individual
,
who
had
helped
Darrell
to
steal
a
march
upon
him
,
Rowland
,
with
Davies
,
and
another
attendant
,
continued
the
pursuit
.
<EOS>
Both
the
fugitive
and
his
chasers
embarked
on
the
Thames
.
<EOS>
The
elements
were
wrathful
as
their
passions
.
<EOS>
The
storm
burst
upon
them
in
its
fury
.
<EOS>
Unmindful
of
the
terrors
of
the
night
,
unscared
by
the
danger
that
threatened
him
,
Rowland
consigned
his
sister
's
husband
and
his
sister
's
child
to
the
waves
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Bring
your
story
to
an
end
,
Sir
,
"
said
Trenchard
who
had
listened
to
the
recital
with
mingled
emotions
of
rage
and
fear
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
nearly
done
,
"
replied
the
stranger.--"As
Rowland
's
whole
crew
perished
in
the
tempest
,
and
he
only
escaped
by
miracle
,
he
fancied
himself
free
from
detection
.
<EOS>
And
for
twelve
years
he
has
been
so
;
until
his
long
security
,
well
-
nigh
obliterating
remembrance
of
the
deed
,
has
bred
almost
a
sense
of
innocence
within
his
breast
.
<EOS>
During
this
period
Sir
Montacute
has
been
gathered
to
his
fathers
.
<EOS>
His
title
has
descended
to
Rowland
:
his
estates
to
Aliva
.
<EOS>
The
latter
has
,
since
,
been
induced
to
unite
herself
to
Sir
Cecil
,
on
terms
originating
with
her
brother
,
and
which
,
however
strange
and
unprecedented
,
were
acquiesced
in
by
the
suitor
.
"
 
<EOS>
Sir
Rowland
looked
bewildered
with
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
marriage
was
never
consummated
,
"
continued
the
imperturbable
stranger
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
Cecil
is
no
more
.
<EOS>
Lady
Trafford
,
supposed
to
be
childless
,
broken
in
health
and
spirits
,
frail
both
in
mind
and
body
,
is
not
likely
to
make
another
marriage
.
<EOS>
The
estates
must
,
ere
long
,
revert
to
Sir
Rowland
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
man
,
or
fiend
?
"
exclaimed
Trenchard
,
staring
at
the
stranger
,
as
he
concluded
his
narration
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
complimentary
,
Sir
Rowland
,
"
returned
the
other
,
with
a
grim
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
_
are
_
human
,
"
rejoined
Trenchard
,
with
stern
emphasis
,
"
I
insist
upon
knowing
whence
you
derived
your
information
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
might
refuse
to
answer
the
question
,
Sir
Rowland
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
not
indisposed
to
gratify
you
.
<EOS>
Partly
,
from
your
confessor
;
partly
,
from
other
sources
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
confessor
!
<EOS>
"
ejaculated
the
knight
,
in
the
extremity
of
surprise
;
"
has
_
<EOS>
he
_
betrayed
his
sacred
trust
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
,
"
replied
the
other
,
grinning
;
"
and
this
will
be
a
caution
to
you
in
future
<EOS>
,
how
you
confide
a
secret
of
consequence
to
a
priest
.
<EOS>
I
should
as
soon
think
of
trusting
a
woman
.
<EOS>
Tickle
the
ears
of
their
reverences
with
any
idle
nonsense
<EOS>
you
please
<EOS>
:
but
tell
them
nothing
you
care
to
have
repeated
.
<EOS>
I
was
once
a
disciple
of
Saint
Peter
myself
,
and
speak
from
experience
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Who
are
you
?
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Trenchard
,
scarcely
able
to
credit
his
senses
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
surprised
you
've
not
asked
that
question
before
,
Sir
Rowland
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
saved
me
much
circumlocution
,
and
you
some
suspense
.
<EOS>
My
name
is
Wild
--
Jonathan
Wild
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
the
great
thief
-
taker
indulged
himself
in
a
chuckle
at
the
effect
produced
by
this
announcement
.
<EOS>
He
was
accustomed
to
such
surprises
,
and
enjoyed
them
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Rowland
laid
his
hand
upon
his
sword
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Wild
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
sarcastic
tone
,
but
with
great
firmness
;
"
a
person
of
your
well
-
known
sagacity
must
be
aware
that
some
secrets
are
dangerous
to
the
possessor
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
fully
aware
of
it
,
Sir
Rowland
,
"
replied
Jonathan
,
coolly
;
"
but
I
have
nothing
to
fear
;
because
,
in
the
first
place
,
it
will
be
to
your
advantage
not
to
molest
me
;
and
,
in
the
second
,
I
am
provided
against
all
contingencies
.
<EOS>
I
never
hunt
the
human
tiger
without
being
armed
.
<EOS>
My
janizaries
are
without
.
<EOS>
One
of
them
is
furnished
with
a
packet
containing
the
heads
of
the
statement
I
have
just
related
,
which
,
if
I
do
n't
return
at
a
certain
time
,
will
be
laid
before
the
proper
authorities
.
<EOS>
I
have
calculated
my
chances
,
you
perceive
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
forgotten
that
you
are
in
my
power
,
"
returned
the
knight
,
sternly
;
"
and
that
all
your
allies
can
not
save
you
from
my
resentment
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
at
least
,
protect
myself
,
"
replied
Wild
,
with
,
provoking
calmness
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
accounted
a
fair
shot
,
as
well
as
a
tolerable
swordsman
,
and
I
will
give
proof
of
my
skill
in
both
lines
,
should
occasion
require
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
had
a
good
many
desperate
engagements
in
my
time
,
and
have
generally
come
off
victorious
.
<EOS>
I
bear
the
marks
of
some
of
them
about
me
still
,
"
he
continued
,
taking
off
his
wig
,
and
laying
bare
a
bald
skull
,
covered
with
cicatrices
and
plates
of
silver
.
"
<EOS>
This
gash
,
"
he
added
,
pointing
to
one
of
the
larger
scars
,
"
was
a
wipe
from
the
hanger
of
Tom
Thurland
,
whom
I
apprehended
for
the
murder
of
Mrs.
Knap
.
<EOS>
This
wedge
of
silver
,
"
pointing
to
another
,
"
which
would
mend
a
coffee
-
pot
,
serves
to
stop
up
a
breach
made
by
Will
Colthurst
,
who
robbed
Mr.
Hearl
on
Hounslow
-
Heath
.
<EOS>
I
secured
the
dog
after
he
had
wounded
me
.
<EOS>
This
fracture
was
the
handiwork
of
Jack
Parrot
(
otherwise
called
Jack
the
Grinder
)
,
who
broke
into
the
palace
of
the
Bishop
of
Norwich
.
<EOS>
Jack
was
a
comical
scoundrel
,
and
made
a
little
too
free
with
his
grace
's
best
burgundy
,
as
well
as
his
grace
's
favourite
housekeeper
.
<EOS>
The
Bishop
,
however
,
to
show
him
the
danger
of
meddling
with
the
church
,
gave
him
a
dance
at
Tyburn
for
his
pains
.
<EOS>
Not
a
scar
but
has
its
history
.
<EOS>
The
only
inconvenience
I
feel
from
my
shattered
noddle
is
an
incapacity
to
drink
.
<EOS>
But
that
's
an
infirmity
shared
by
a
great
many
sounder
heads
than
mine
.
<EOS>
The
hardest
bout
I
ever
had
was
with
a
woman
--
Sally
Wells
,
who
was
afterwards
lagged
for
shoplifting
.
<EOS>
She
attacked
me
with
a
carving
-
knife
,
and
,
when
I
had
disarmed
her
,
the
jade
bit
off
a
couple
of
fingers
from
my
left
hand
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
you
see
,
I
've
never
hesitated
and
never
_
shall
_
hesitate
to
expose
my
life
where
anything
is
to
be
gained
.
<EOS>
My
profession
has
hardened
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
with
this
,
he
coolly
re
-
adjusted
his
peruke
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
expect
to
gain
from
this
interview
,
Mr.
Wild
!
"
<EOS>
demanded
Trenchard
,
as
if
he
had
formed
a
sudden
resolution
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
now
we
come
to
business
,
"
returned
Jonathan
,
rubbing
his
hands
,
gleefully
.
<EOS>
"
These
are
my
terms
,
Sir
Rowland
,
"
he
added
,
taking
a
sheet
of
paper
from
his
pocket
,
and
pushing
it
towards
the
knight
.
 
<EOS>
Trenchard
glanced
at
the
document
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
thousand
pounds
,
"
he
observed
,
gloomily
,
"
is
a
heavy
price
to
pay
for
doubtful
secrecy
,
when
_
certain
silence
_
might
be
so
cheaply
procured
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
would
purchase
it
at
the
price
of
your
head
,
"
replied
Jonathan
,
knitting
his
brows
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
Rowland
,
"
he
added
,
savagely
,
and
with
somewhat
of
the
look
of
a
bull
-
dog
before
he
flies
at
his
foe
,
"
if
it
were
my
pleasure
to
do
so
,
I
could
crush
you
with
a
breath
.
<EOS>
You
are
wholly
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
Your
name
,
with
the
fatal
epithet
of
'
dangerous
'
attached
to
it
,
stands
foremost
on
the
list
of
Disaffected
now
before
the
Secret
Committee
.
<EOS>
I
hold
a
warrant
from
Mr.
Walpole
for
your
apprehension
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Arrested
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Trenchard
,
drawing
his
sword
.
 
<EOS>
"
Put
up
your
blade
,
Sir
Rowland
,
"
rejoined
Jonathan
,
resuming
his
former
calm
demeanour
,
"
King
James
the
Third
will
need
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
intention
of
arresting
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
different
game
to
play
;
and
it
'll
be
your
own
fault
,
if
you
do
n't
come
off
the
winner
.
<EOS>
I
offer
you
my
assistance
on
certain
terms
.
<EOS>
The
proposal
is
so
far
from
being
exorbitant
,
that
it
should
be
trebled
if
I
had
not
a
fellow
-
feeling
in
the
cause
.
<EOS>
To
be
frank
with
you
,
I
have
an
affront
to
requite
,
which
can
be
settled
at
the
same
time
,
and
in
the
same
way
with
your
affair
.
<EOS>
That
's
worth
something
to
me
;
for
I
do
n't
mind
paying
for
revenge
.
<EOS>
After
all
a
thousand
pounds
is
a
trifle
to
rid
you
of
an
upstart
,
who
may
chance
to
deprive
you
of
tens
of
thousands
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Did
I
hear
you
aright
?
"
asked
Trenchard
,
with
startling
eagerness
.
 
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
replied
Jonathan
,
with
the
most
perfect
_
sangfroid
_
,
"
I
'll
undertake
to
free
you
from
the
boy
.
<EOS>
That
's
part
of
the
bargain
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Is
he
alive
!
"
<EOS>
vociferated
Trenchard
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
,
"
returned
Wild
;
"
he
's
not
only
alive
,
but
likely
for
life
,
if
we
do
n't
clip
the
thread
.
"
 
<EOS>
Sir
Rowland
caught
at
a
chair
for
support
,
and
passed
his
hand
across
his
brow
,
on
which
the
damp
had
gathered
thickly
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
intelligence
seems
new
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
thought
I
'd
been
sufficiently
explicit
,
"
continued
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
Most
persons
would
have
guessed
my
meaning
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
it
was
_
not
_
a
dream
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Sir
Rowland
in
a
hollow
voice
,
and
as
if
speaking
to
himself
.
<EOS>
"
I
_
did
_
see
them
on
the
platform
of
the
bridge
--
the
child
and
his
preserver
!
<EOS>
They
were
_
not
_
struck
by
the
fallen
ruin
,
nor
whelmed
in
the
roaring
flood,--or
,
<EOS>
if
they
_
were
_
,
they
escaped
as
I
escaped
.
<EOS>
God
!
<EOS>
I
have
cheated
myself
into
a
belief
that
the
boy
perished
!
<EOS>
And
now
my
worst
fears
are
realized
--
he
lives
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
As
yet
,
"
returned
Jonathan
,
with
fearful
emphasis
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
cannot
--
dare
not
injure
him
,
"
rejoined
Trenchard
,
with
a
haggard
look
,
and
sinking
,
as
if
paralysed
,
into
a
chair
.
 
<EOS>
Jonathan
laughed
scornfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
Leave
him
to
me
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
He
sha
n't
trouble
you
further
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Sir
Rowland
,
who
appeared
completely
prostrated
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
struggle
no
longer
with
destiny
.
<EOS>
Too
much
blood
has
been
shed
already
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
This
comes
of
fine
feelings
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
Jonathan
,
contemptuously
.
<EOS>
"
Give
me
your
thorough
-
paced
villain
.
<EOS>
But
I
sha
n't
let
him
off
thus
.
<EOS>
I
'll
try
a
strong
dose.--Am
I
to
understand
that
you
intend
to
plead
guilty
,
Sir
Rowland
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
.
<EOS>
"
If
so
,
I
may
as
well
execute
my
warrant
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Stand
off
,
Sir
!
"
exclaimed
Trenchard
,
starting
suddenly
backwards
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
knew
that
would
bring
him
to
,
"
thought
Wild
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
is
the
boy
?
"
demanded
Sir
Rowland
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
present
under
the
care
of
his
preserver
--
one
Owen
Wood
,
a
carpenter
,
by
whom
he
was
brought
up
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Wood
!
"
exclaimed
Trenchard,--"of
Wych
Street
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
same
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
boy
from
his
shop
was
here
a
short
time
ago
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
him
you
mean
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
That
boy
was
the
carpenter
's
apprentice
,
Jack
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
I
've
just
left
your
nephew
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
Charcam
entered
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
Beg
pardon
,
Sir
Rowland
,
"
said
the
attendant
,
"
but
there
's
a
boy
from
Mr.
Wood
,
with
a
message
for
Lady
Trafford
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
From
whom
?
"
vociferated
Trenchard
.
 
<EOS>
"
From
Mr.
Wood
the
carpenter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
same
who
was
here
just
now
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
Sir
Rowland
,
a
much
finer
boy
.
"
 
"
'
Tis
he
,
by
Heaven
!
"
cried
Jonathan
;
"
this
is
lucky
.
<EOS>
Sir
Rowland
,
"
he
added
,
in
a
deep
whisper
,
"
do
you
agree
to
my
terms
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
answered
Trenchard
,
in
the
same
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Enough
!
"
rejoined
Wild
;
"
he
shall
not
return
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
acquainted
him
with
Lady
Trafford
's
departure
?
"
said
the
knight
,
addressing
Charcam
,
with
as
much
composure
as
he
could
assume
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
Sir
Rowland
,
"
replied
the
attendant
,
"
as
you
proposed
to
ride
to
Saint
Albans
to
-
night
,
I
thought
you
might
choose
to
see
him
yourself
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
there
's
something
odd
about
the
boy
;
for
,
though
I
questioned
him
pretty
closely
concerning
his
business
,
he
declined
answering
my
questions
,
and
said
he
could
only
deliver
his
message
to
her
ladyship
.
<EOS>
I
thought
it
better
not
to
send
him
away
till
I
'd
mentioned
the
circumstance
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
did
right
,
"
returned
Trenchard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
is
he
?
"
asked
Jonathan
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
the
hall
,
"
replied
Charcam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Alone
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
exactly
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
There
's
another
lad
at
the
gate
waiting
for
him
--
the
same
who
was
here
just
now
,
that
Sir
Rowland
was
speaking
of
,
who
fastened
up
the
jewel
-
case
for
her
ladyship
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
jewel
-
case
!
"
exclaimed
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
I
see
it
all
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
with
a
quick
glance
.
"
<EOS>
Jack
Sheppard
's
fingers
are
lime
-
twigs
.
<EOS>
Was
anything
missed
after
the
lad
's
departure
,
Sir
Rowland
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
that
I
'm
aware
of
,
"
said
the
knight.--"Stay
!
<EOS>
something
occurs
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
conferred
apart
with
Jonathan
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
it
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Wild
when
Trenchard
concluded
.
<EOS>
"
This
young
fool
is
come
to
restore
the
article
--
whatever
it
may
be
--
which
Lady
Trafford
was
anxious
to
conceal
,
and
which
his
companion
purloined
.
<EOS>
It
's
precisely
what
such
a
simpleton
would
do
.
<EOS>
We
have
him
as
safe
as
a
linnet
in
a
cage
;
and
could
wring
his
neck
round
as
easily
.
<EOS>
Oblige
me
by
acting
under
my
guidance
in
the
matter
,
Sir
Rowland
.
<EOS>
I
'm
an
old
hand
at
such
things
.
<EOS>
Harkee
,
"
he
added
,
"
Mr.
What's
-
your
-
name
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Charcam
,
"
replied
the
attendant
,
bowing
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
Mr.
Charcoal
,
you
may
bring
in
the
boy
.
<EOS>
But
not
a
word
to
him
of
Lady
Trafford
's
absence
--
mind
that
.
<EOS>
A
robbery
has
been
committed
,
and
your
master
suspects
this
lad
as
an
accessory
to
the
offence
.
<EOS>
He
,
therefore
,
desires
to
interrogate
him
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
necessary
to
secure
his
companion
;
and
as
you
say
he
is
not
in
the
house
,
some
caution
must
be
used
in
approaching
him
,
or
he
may
chance
to
take
to
his
heels
,
for
he
's
a
slippery
little
rascal
.
<EOS>
When
you
've
seized
him
,
cough
thrice
<EOS>
thus,--and
two
rough
-
looking
gentlemen
will
make
their
appearance
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
alarmed
by
their
manners
,
Mr.
Charcoal
.
<EOS>
They
're
apt
to
be
surly
to
strangers
,
but
it
soon
wears
off
.
<EOS>
The
gentleman
with
the
red
beard
will
relieve
you
of
your
prisoner
.
<EOS>
The
other
must
call
a
coach
as
quickly
as
he
can
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
For
whom
,
Sir
?
"
inquired
Charcam
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
me
--
his
master
,
Mr.
Jonathan
Wild
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
Mr.
Jonathan
Wild
?
"
asked
the
attendant
,
in
great
trepidation
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
_
am
_
,
Charcoal
.
<EOS>
But
do
n't
let
my
name
frighten
you
.
<EOS>
Though
,
"
said
the
thief
-
taker
,
with
a
complacent
smile
,
"
all
the
world
seems
to
tremble
at
it
.
<EOS>
Obey
my
orders
,
and
you
've
nothing
to
fear
.
<EOS>
About
them
quickly
.
<EOS>
Lead
the
lad
to
suppose
that
he
'll
be
introduced
to
Lady
Trafford
.
<EOS>
You
understand
me
,
Charcoal
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
attendant
did
_
not
_
understand
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
confounded
by
the
presence
in
which
he
found
himself
.
<EOS>
But
,
not
daring
to
confess
his
want
of
comprehension
,
he
made
a
profound
reverence
,
and
retired
.

CHAPTER
IX
.
 
<EOS>
Consequences
of
the
Theft
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
mean
to
act
,
Sir
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Trenchard
,
as
soon
as
they
were
left
alone
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
circumstances
shall
dictate
,
Sir
Rowland
,
"
returned
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
Something
is
sure
to
arise
in
the
course
of
the
investigation
,
of
which
I
can
take
advantage
.
<EOS>
If
not
,
I
'll
convey
him
to
St.
Giles
's
round
-
house
on
my
own
responsibility
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Is
this
your
notable
scheme
!
"
<EOS>
asked
the
knight
,
scornfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
Once
there
,
"
proceeded
Wild
,
without
noticing
the
interruption
,
"
he
's
as
good
as
in
his
grave
.
<EOS>
The
constable
,
Sharples
,
is
in
my
pay
.
<EOS>
I
can
remove
the
prisoner
at
any
hour
of
the
night
I
think
fit
:
and
<EOS>
I
_
will
_
remove
him
.
<EOS>
You
must
,
know
,
Sir
Rowland
--
<EOS>
for
I
've
no
secrets
from
you
<EOS>
--
that
,
in
the
course
of
my
business
I
've
found
it
convenient
to
become
the
owner
of
a
small
Dutch
sloop
;
by
means
of
which
I
can
transmit
any
light
ware,--such
as
gold
watches
,
rings
,
and
plate
,
as
well
as
occasionally
a
bank
or
goldsmith
's
note
,
which
has
been
_
spoken
with
_
by
way
of
the
mail,--you
<EOS>
understand
me?--to
Holland
or
Flanders
,
and
obtain
a
secure
and
ready
market
for
them
.
<EOS>
This
vessel
is
now
in
the
river
,
off
Wapping
.
<EOS>
Her
cargo
is
nearly
shipped
.
<EOS>
She
will
sail
,
at
early
dawn
to
-
morrow
,
for
Rotterdam
.
<EOS>
Her
commander
,
Rykhart
Van
Galgebrok
,
is
devoted
to
my
interests
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
gets
into
blue
water
,
he
'll
think
no
more
of
pitching
the
boy
overboard
than
of
lighting
his
pipe
.
<EOS>
This
will
be
safer
than
cutting
his
throat
on
shore
.
<EOS>
I
've
tried
the
plan
,
and
found
it
answer
.
<EOS>
The
Northern
Ocean
keeps
a
secret
better
than
the
Thames
,
Sir
Rowland
.
<EOS>
Before
midnight
,
your
nephew
shall
be
safe
beneath
the
hatches
of
the
Zeeslang
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
child
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
Trenchard
,
abstractedly
;
"
the
whole
scene
upon
the
river
is
passing
before
me
.
<EOS>
I
hear
the
splash
in
the
water
--
I
see
the
white
object
floating
like
a
sea
-
bird
on
the
tide
--
it
will
not
sink
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
'
Sblood
!
"
exclaimed
Jonathan
,
in
a
tone
of
ill
-
disguised
contempt
;
"
it
wo
n't
do
to
indulge
those
fancies
now
.
<EOS>
Be
seated
,
and
calm
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
often
conjured
up
some
frightful
vision
of
the
dead
,
"
murmured
the
knight
,
"
but
I
never
dreamed
of
an
interview
with
the
living
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
'll
be
over
in
a
few
minutes
,
"
rejoined
Jonathan
,
impatiently
;
"
in
fact
,
it
'll
be
over
too
soon
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
like
such
interviews
.
<EOS>
But
we
waste
time
.
<EOS>
Have
the
goodness
to
affix
your
name
to
that
memorandum
,
Sir
Rowland
.
<EOS>
I
require
nothing
,
you
see
,
till
my
share
of
the
contract
is
fulfilled
.
"
 
<EOS>
Trenchard
took
up
a
pen
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
boy
's
death
-
warrant
,
"
observed
Jonathan
,
with
a
sinister
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
sign
it
,
"
returned
Trenchard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Damnation
!
"
exclaimed
Wild
with
a
snarl
,
that
displayed
his
glistening
fangs
to
the
farthest
extremity
of
his
mouth
,
"
I
'm
not
to
be
trifled
with
thus
.
<EOS>
That
paper
_
must
_
be
signed
,
or
I
take
my
departure
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Go
,
Sir
,
"
rejoined
the
knight
,
haughtily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
I
'll
go
,
fast
enough
!
"
<EOS>
returned
Jonathan
,
putting
his
hands
into
his
pockets
,
"
but
not
alone
,
Sir
Rowland
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
the
door
was
flung
open
,
and
Charcam
entered
,
dragging
in
Thames
,
whom
he
held
by
the
collar
,
and
who
struggled
in
vain
to
free
himself
from
the
grasp
imposed
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
's
one
of
the
thieves
,
Sir
Rowland
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
attendant
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
only
just
in
time
.
<EOS>
The
young
rascal
had
learnt
from
some
of
the
women
-
servants
that
Lady
Trafford
was
from
home
,
and
was
in
the
very
act
of
making
off
when
I
got
down
stairs
.
<EOS>
Come
along
,
my
Newgate
bird
!
"
<EOS>
he
continued
,
shaking
him
with
great
violence
.
 
<EOS>
Jonathan
gave
utterance
to
a
low
whistle
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
things
had
gone
smoothly
,
"
he
thought
,
"
I
should
have
cursed
the
fellow
's
stupidity
.
<EOS>
As
it
is
,
I
'm
not
sorry
for
the
blunder
.
"
 
<EOS>
Trenchard
,
meanwhile
,
whose
gaze
was
fixed
upon
the
boy
,
became
livid
as
death
,
but
he
moved
not
a
muscle
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
T
is
he
!
"
<EOS>
he
mentally
ejaculated
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
of
your
nephew
,
Sir
Rowland
?
"
<EOS>
whispered
Jonathan
,
who
sat
with
his
back
towards
Thames
,
so
that
his
features
were
concealed
from
the
youth
's
view
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
a
thousand
pities
,
would
n't
it
,
to
put
so
promising
a
lad
out
of
the
way
?
<EOS>
"
 
"
Devil
!
"
exclaimed
the
knight
fiercely
,
"
Give
me
the
paper
.
"
 
<EOS>
Jonathan
hastily
picked
up
the
pen
,
and
presented
it
to
Trenchard
,
who
attached
his
signature
to
the
document
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
_
am
_
<EOS>
the
devil
,
"
observed
Wild
,
"
as
some
folks
assert
,
and
I
myself
am
not
unwilling
to
believe
<EOS>
,
you
'll
find
that
I
differ
from
the
generally
-
received
notions
of
the
arch
-
fiend
,
and
faithfully
execute
the
commands
of
those
who
confide
their
souls
to
my
custody
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Take
hence
this
boy
,
then
,
"
rejoined
Trenchard
;
"
his
looks
unman
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Of
what
am
I
accused
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Thames
,
who
though
a
good
deal
alarmed
at
first
,
had
now
regained
his
courage
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
robbery
!
"
replied
Jonathan
in
a
thundering
voice
,
and
suddenly
confronting
him
.
<EOS>
"
You
've
charged
with
assisting
your
comrade
,
Jack
Sheppard
,
to
purloin
certain
articles
of
value
from
a
jewel
-
case
belonging
to
Lady
Trafford
.
<EOS>
Aha
!
"
<EOS>
he
continued
,
producing
a
short
silver
staff
,
which
he
carried
constantly
about
with
him
,
and
uttering
a
terrible
imprecation
,
"
I
see
you
're
confounded
.
<EOS>
Down
on
your
marrow
-
bones
,
sirrah
!
<EOS>
Confess
your
guilt
,
and
Sir
Rowland
may
yet
save
you
from
the
gallows
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
nothing
to
confess
,
"
replied
Thames
,
boldly
;
"
I
've
done
no
wrong
.
<EOS>
Are
_
<EOS>
you
_
my
accuser
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
,
"
replied
Wild
;
"
have
you
anything
to
allege
to
the
contrary
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Only
this
,
"
returned
Thames
:
"
that
the
charge
is
false
,
and
malicious
,
and
that
_
<EOS>
you
<EOS>
_
know
it
to
be
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Is
that
all
!
"
<EOS>
retorted
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
I
must
search
you
my
youngster
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
sha
n't
touch
me
,
"
rejoined
Thames
;
and
,
suddenly
bursting
from
Charcam
,
he
threw
himself
at
the
feet
of
Trenchard
.
"
<EOS>
Hear
me
,
Sir
Rowland
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
innocent
,
f
have
stolen
nothing
.
<EOS>
This
person
--
this
Jonathan
Wild
,
whom
I
beheld
for
the
first
time
,
scarcely
an
hour
ago
,
in
Wych
Street
,
is
--
I
know
not
why
--
<EOS>
my
enemy
.
<EOS>
He
has
sworn
that
he
'll
take
away
my
life
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Bah
!
"
interrupted
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
listen
to
this
nonsense
,
Sir
Rowland
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
_
are
_
innocent
,
boy
,
"
said
the
knight
,
controlling
his
emotion
;
"
you
have
nothing
to
apprehend
.
<EOS>
But
,
what
brought
you
here
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Excuse
me
,
Sir
Rowland
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
answer
that
question
.
<EOS>
My
business
is
with
Lady
Trafford
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
aware
that
I
am
her
ladyship
's
brother
?
"
returned
the
knight
.
<EOS>
"
She
has
no
secrets
from
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Possibly
not
,
"
replied
Thames
,
in
some
confusion
;
"
but
I
am
not
at
liberty
to
speak
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
hesitation
is
not
in
your
favour
,
"
observed
Trenchard
,
sternly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
he
consent
,
to
be
searched
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Jonathan
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
rejoined
Thames
,
"
I
wo
n't
be
treated
like
a
common
felon
,
if
I
can
help
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
be
treated
according
to
your
deserts
,
then
,
"
said
Jonathan
,
maliciously
.
<EOS>
And
,
in
spite
of
the
boy
's
resistance
,
he
plunged
his
hands
into
his
pockets
,
and
drew
forth
the
miniature
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
did
you
get
this
from
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Wild
,
greatly
surprised
at
the
result
of
his
investigation
.
 
<EOS>
Thames
returned
no
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
as
much
,
"
continued
Jonathan
.
"
<EOS>
But
we
'll
find
a
way
to
make
you
open
your
lips
presently
.
<EOS>
Bring
in
his
comrade
,
"
he
added
,
in
a
whisper
to
Charcam
;
"
I
'll
take
care
of
him
.
<EOS>
And
do
n't
neglect
my
instructions
this
time
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Upon
which
,
with
an
assurance
that
he
would
not
do
so
,
the
attendant
departed
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
,
of
course
,
identify
this
picture
as
Lady
Trafford
's
property
?
"
pursued
Jonathan
,
with
a
meaning
glance
,
as
he
handed
it
to
the
knight
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
,
"
replied
Trenchard
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
with
a
sudden
start
,
as
his
glance
fell
upon
the
portrait
;
"
how
came
this
into
your
possession
,
boy
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
do
n't
you
answer
,
sirrah
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Wild
,
in
a
savage
tone
,
and
striking
him
with
the
silver
staff
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ca
n't
you
speak
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
choose
,
"
replied
Thames
,
sturdily
;
"
and
your
brutality
sha
n't
make
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
'll
see
that
,
"
replied
Jonathan
,
dealing
him
another
and
more
violent
blow
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
him
alone
,
"
said
Trenchard
authoritatively
,
"
I
have
another
question
to
propose
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
whoso
portrait
<EOS>
this
is
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
,
"
replied
Thames
,
repressing
his
tears
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
believe
it
to
be
the
portrait
of
my
father
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
exclaimed
the
knight
,
in
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"
Is
your
father
alive
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
returned
Thames
;
"
he
was
assassinated
while
I
was
an
infant
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Who
told
you
this
is
his
portrait
?
"
demanded
Trenchard
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
heart
,
"
rejoined
Thames
,
firmly
;
"
which
now
tells
me
I
am
in
the
presence
of
his
murderer
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
me
,
"
interposed
Jonathan
;
"
a
thief
-
taker
is
always
a
murderer
in
the
eyes
of
a
thief
.
<EOS>
I
'm
almost
sorry
your
suspicions
are
unfounded
,
if
your
father
in
any
way
resembled
you
,
my
youngster
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
tell
you
who
'll
have
the
pleasure
of
hanging
your
father
's
son
;
and
that
's
a
person
not
a
hundred
miles
distant
from
you
at
this
moment
--
ha
!
ha
!
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
said
this
,
the
door
was
opened
,
and
Charcam
entered
,
accompanied
by
a
dwarfish
,
shabby
-
looking
man
,
in
a
brown
serge
frock
,
with
coarse
Jewish
features
,
and
a
long
red
beard
.
<EOS>
Between
the
Jew
and
the
attendant
came
Jack
Sheppard
;
while
a
crowd
of
servants
,
attracted
by
the
news
,
that
the
investigation
of
a
robbery
was
going
forward
,
lingered
at
the
doorway
in
hopes
of
catching
something
of
the
proceedings
.
 
<EOS>
When
Jack
was
brought
in
,
he
cast
a
rapid
glance
around
him
,
and
perceiving
Thames
in
the
custody
of
Jonathan
,
instantly
divined
how
matters
stood
.
<EOS>
As
he
looked
in
this
direction
,
Wild
gave
him
a
significant
wink
,
the
meaning
of
which
he
was
not
slow
to
comprehend
.
 
<EOS>
"
Get
it
over
quickly
,
"
said
Trenchard
,
in
a
whisper
to
the
thief
-
taker
.
 
<EOS>
Jonathan
nodded
assent
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
your
name
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
addressing
the
audacious
lad
,
who
was
looking
about
him
as
coolly
as
if
nothing
material
was
going
on
.
 
<EOS>
"
Jack
Sheppard
,
"
returned
the
boy
,
fixing
his
eyes
upon
a
portrait
of
the
Earl
of
Mar.
<EOS>
"
Who
's
that
queer
cove
in
the
full
-
bottomed
wig
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Attend
to
me
,
sirrah
,
"
rejoined
Wild
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
this
picture
?
"
he
added
,
with
another
significant
look
,
and
pointing
to
the
miniature
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
replied
Jack
,
carelessly
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
well
.
<EOS>
Can
you
inform
us
whence
it
came
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
State
the
facts
,
then
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
came
from
Lady
Trafford
's
jewel
-
box
.
"
 
<EOS>
Here
a
murmur
of
amazement
arose
from
the
assemblage
outside
.
 
<EOS>
"
Close
the
door
!
"
commanded
Trenchard
,
impatiently
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
my
opinion
,
Sir
Rowland
,
"
suggested
Jonathan
;
"
you
'd
better
allow
the
court
to
remain
open
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Be
it
so
,
"
replied
the
knight
,
who
saw
the
force
of
this
reasoning
.
"
<EOS>
Continue
the
proceedings
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
say
that
the
miniature
was
abstracted
from
Lady
Trafford
's
jewel

box

"
said
Jonathan
,
in
a
loud
voice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Who
took
it
thence
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Thames
Darrell
;
the
boy
at
your
side
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Jack
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Thames
,
in
indignant
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
But
Sheppard
took
no
notice
of
the
exclamation
.
 
<EOS>
A
loud
buzz
of
curiosity
circulated
among
the
domestics
;
some
of
whom
--
especially
the
females
--
leaned
forward
to
obtain
a
peep
at
the
culprit
.
 
<EOS>
"
Si
--
lence
!
"
<EOS>
vociferated
Charcam
,
laying
great
emphasis
on
the
last
syllable
.
 
<EOS>
"
Were
you
present
at
the
time
of
the
robbery
?
"
pursued
Jonathan
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
,
"
answered
Sheppard
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
will
swear
to
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Liar
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
"
Enough
!
"
exclaimed
Wild
,
triumphantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Close
the
court
,
Mr.
Charcoal
.
<EOS>
They
've
heard
quite
enough
for
my
purpose
,
"
he
muttered
,
as
his
orders
were
obeyed
,
and
the
domestics
excluded
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
too
late
to
carry
'em
before
a
magistrate
now
,
Sir
Rowland
;
so
,
with
your
permission
,
I
'll
give
'em
a
night
's
lodging
in
Saint
Giles
's
round
-
house
.
<EOS>
You
,
Jack
Sheppard
,
have
nothing
to
fear
,
as
you
've
become
evidence
against
your
accomplice
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
,
I
shall
carry
you
before
Justice
Walters
,
who
'll
take
your
information
;
and
I
've
no
doubt
<EOS>
but
Thames
Darrell
will
be
fully
committed
.
<EOS>
Now
,
for
the
cage
,
my
pretty
canary
-
bird
.
<EOS>
Before
we
start
,
I
'll
accommodate
you
with
a
pair
of
ruffles
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
proceeded
to
handcuff
his
captive
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hear
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Thames
,
bursting
into
tears
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
innocent
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
have
committed
this
robbery
.
<EOS>
I
have
only
just
left
Wych
Street
.
<EOS>
Send
for
Mr.
Wood
,
and
you
'll
find
that
I
've
spoken
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
'd
better
hold
your
peace
,
my
lad
,
"
observed
Jonathan
,
in
a
menacing
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lady
Trafford
would
not
have
thus
condemned
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
"
Away
with
him
!
"
exclaimed
Sir
Rowland
,
impatiently
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
the
prisoners
below
,
Nab
,
"
said
Jonathan
,
addressing
the
dwarfish
Jew
;
"
I
'll
join
you
in
an
instant
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
bearded
miscreant
seized
Jack
by
the
waist
,
and
Thames
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
,
and
marched
off
,
like
the
ogre
in
the
fairy
tale
,
with
a
boy
under
each
arm
,
while
Charcam
brought
upt
the
rear
.
     
<EOS>
CHAPTER
X.
 
Mother
and
Son
.
  
<EOS>
They
had
scarcely
been
gone
a
moment
,
when
a
confused
noise
was
heard
without
,
and
Charcam
re
-
entered
the
room
,
with
a
countenance
of
the
utmost
bewilderment
and
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
with
the
man
?
"
demanded
Wild
.
 
<EOS>
"
Her
ladyship--
"
faltered
the
attendant
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
of
her
?
"
cried
the
knight
.
<EOS>
"
Is
she
returned
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Y
--
e
--
s
,
Sir
Rowland
,
"
stammered
Charcam
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
devil
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
Here
's
a
cross
-
bite
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
that
's
not
all
,
your
honour
,
"
continued
Charcam
;
"
Mrs.
Norris
says
she
's
dying
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Dying
!
"
echoed
the
knight
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dying
,
Sir
Rowland
.
<EOS>
She
was
taken
dreadfully
ill
on
the
road
,
with
spasms
and
short
breath
,
and
swoonings,--worse
than
ever
she
was
before
.
<EOS>
And
Mrs.
Norris
was
so
frightened
that
she
ordered
the
postboys
to
drive
back
as
fast
as
they
could
.
<EOS>
She
never
expected
to
get
her
ladyship
home
alive
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
God
!
"
cried
Trenchard
,
stunned
by
the
intelligence
,
"
I
have
killed
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
,
"
rejoined
Wild
,
with
a
sneer
;
"
but
do
n't
let
all
the
world
know
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
're
lifting
her
out
of
the
carriage
,
"
interposed
Charcam
;
"
will
it
please
your
honour
to
send
for
some
advice
and
the
chaplain
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Fly
for
both
,
"
returned
Sir
Rowland
,
in
a
tone
of
bitter
anguish
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stay
!
"
<EOS>
interposed
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
Where
are
the
boys
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
the
hall
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Her
ladyship
will
pass
through
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
;
there
's
no
other
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
,
bring
them
into
this
room
,
the
first
thing
--
quick
!
<EOS>
They
must
not
meet
,
Sir
Rowland
,
"
he
added
,
as
Charcam
hastened
to
obey
his
instructions
.
 
<EOS>
"
Heaven
has
decreed
it
otherwise
,
"
replied
the
knight
,
dejectedly
.
<EOS>
"
I
yield
to
fate
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yield
to
nothing
,
"
returned
Wild
,
trying
to
re
-
assure
him
;
"
above
all
,
when
your
designs
prosper
.
<EOS>
Man
's
fate
is
in
his
own
hands
.
<EOS>
You
are
your
nephew
's
executioner
,
or
he
is
yours
.
<EOS>
Cast
off
this
weakness
.
<EOS>
The
next
hour
makes
,
or
mars
you
for
ever
.
<EOS>
Go
to
your
sister
,
and
do
not
quit
her
till
all
is
over
.
<EOS>
Leave
the
rest
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
Sir
Rowland
moved
irresolutely
towards
the
door
,
but
recoiled
before
a
sad
spectacle
.
<EOS>
This
was
his
sister
,
evidently
in
the
last
extremity
.
<EOS>
Borne
in
the
arms
of
a
couple
of
assistants
,
and
preceded
by
Mrs.
Norris
,
wringing
her
hands
and
wepping
,
the
unfortunate
lady
was
placed
upon
a
couch
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
Charcam
,
who
seemed
perfectly
distracted
by
the
recent
occurrences
,
dragged
in
Thames
,
leaving
Jack
Sheppard
outside
in
the
custody
of
the
dwarfish
Jew
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hell
's
curses
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
Jonathan
between
his
teeth
;
"
that
fool
will
ruin
all
.
<EOS>
Take
him
away
,
"
he
added
,
striding
up
to
Charcam
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
him
remain
,
"
interposed
Trenchard
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
you
please
,
Sir
Rowland
,
"
returned
Jonathan
,
with
affected
indifference
;
"
but
I
'm
not
going
to
hunt
the
deer
for
another
to
eat
the
ven'son
,
depend
on
'
t.
"
 
<EOS>
But
seeing
that
no
notice
was
taken
of
the
retort
,
he
drew
a
little
aside
,
and
folded
his
arms
,
muttering
,
"
This
whim
will
soon
be
over
.
<EOS>
She
ca
n't
last
long
.
<EOS>
I
can
pull
the
strings
of
this
stiff
-
necked
puppet
as
I
please
.
"
 
<EOS>
Sir
Rowland
,
meantime
,
throw
himself
on
his
knees
beside
his
sister
,
and
,
clasping
her
chilly
fingers
within
his
own
,
besought
her
forgiveness
in
the
most
passionate
terms
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
minutes
,
she
appeared
scarcely
sensible
of
his
presence
.
<EOS>
But
,
after
some
restoratives
had
been
administered
by
Mrs.
Norris
,
she
revived
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
"
Rowland
,
"
she
said
,
in
a
faint
voice
,
"
I
have
not
many
minutes
to
live
.
<EOS>
Where
is
Father
Spencer
?
<EOS>
I
must
have
absolution
.
<EOS>
I
have
something
that
weighs
heavily
upon
my
mind
.
"
 
<EOS>
Sir
Rowland
's
brow
darkened
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
sent
for
him
,
"
Aliva
,
he
answered
;
"
he
will
be
here
directly
,
with
your
medical
advisers
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
are
useless
,
"
she
returned
.
<EOS>
"
Medicine
can
not
save
mo
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Dear
sister----
"
 
"
I
should
die
happy
,
if
I
could
behold
my
child
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Comfort
yourself
,
then
,
Aliva
.
<EOS>
You
_
shall
_
behold
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
mocking
me
,
Rowland
.
<EOS>
Jests
are
not
for
seasons
like
this
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
,
by
Heaven
,
"
returned
the
knight
,
solemnly
.
"
<EOS>
Leave
us
,
Mrs.
Norris
,
and
do
not
return
till
Father
Spencer
arrives
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
ladyship----
"
hesitated
Norris
.
 
<EOS>
"
Go
!
"
said
Lady
Trafford
;
"
it
is
my
last
request
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
her
faithful
attendant
,
drowned
in
tears
,
withdrew
,
followed
by
the
two
assistants
.
 
<EOS>
Jonathan
stepped
behind
a
curtain
.
 
<EOS>
"
Rowland
,
"
said
Lady
Trafford
,
regarding
him
with
a
look
of
indescribable
anxiety
,
"
you
have
assured
me
that
I
shall
behold
my
son
.
<EOS>
Where
is
he
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Within
this
room
,
"
replied
the
knight
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
!
"
shrieked
Lady
Trafford
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
,
"
repeated
her
brother
.
"
<EOS>
But
calm
yourself
,
dear
sister
,
or
the
interview
will
be
too
much
for
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
_
am
_
calm
--
quite
calm
,
Rowland
,
"
she
answered
,
with
lips
whose
agitation
belied
her
words
.
"
<EOS>
Then
,
the
story
of
his
death
was
false
.
<EOS>
I
knew
it
.
<EOS>
I
was
sure
you
could
not
have
the
heart
to
slay
a
child
--
an
innocent
child
.
<EOS>
God
forgive
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
May
He
,
indeed
,
forgive
me
!
"
<EOS>
returned
Trenchard
,
crossing
himself
devoutly
;
"
but
my
guilt
is
not
the
less
heavy
,
because
your
child
escaped
.
<EOS>
This
hand
consigned
him
to
destruction
,
but
another
was
stretched
forth
to
save
him
.
<EOS>
The
infant
was
rescued
from
a
watery
-
grave
by
an
honest
mechanic
,
who
has
since
brought
him
up
as
his
own
son
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Blessings
upon
him
!
"
cried
Lady
Trafford
,
fervently
.
"
<EOS>
But
trifle
with
mo
no
longer
.
<EOS>
Moments
are
ages
now
.
<EOS>
Let
me
see
my
child
,
if
he
is
really
here
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Behold
him
!
"
returned
Trenchard
,
taking
Thames
(
who
had
been
a
mute
,
but
deeply
-
interested
,
witness
of
the
scene
)
by
the
hand
,
and
leading
him
towards
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
exclaimed
Lady
Trafford
,
exerting
all
her
strength
.
<EOS>
"
My
sight
is
failing
me
.
<EOS>
Let
me
have
more
light
,
that
I
may
behold
him
.
<EOS>
Yes
!
"
<EOS>
she
screamed
,
"
these
are
his
father
's
features
!
<EOS>
It
is
--
it
is
my
son
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mother
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Thames
;
"
are
you
,
indeed
,
my
mother
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
,
indeed
--
my
own
sweet
boy
!
"
<EOS>
she
sobbed
,
pressing
him
tenderly
to
her
breast
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh!--to
see
you
thus
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Thames
,
in
an
agony
of
affliction
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
weep
,
my
love
,
"
replied
the
lady
,
straining
him
still
more
closely
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
happy
--
quite
happy
now
.
"
 
<EOS>
During
this
touching
interview
,
a
change
had
come
over
Sir
Rowland
,
and
he
half
repented
of
what
he
had
done
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
no
longer
refuse
to
tell
me
the
name
of
this
youth
's
father
,
Aliva
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
dare
not
,
Rowland
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
break
my
vow
.
<EOS>
I
will
confide
it
to
Father
Spencer
,
who
will
acquaint
you
with
it
when
I
am
no
more
.
<EOS>
Undraw
the
curtain
,
love
,
"
she
added
to
Thames
,
"
that
I
may
look
at
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
"
exclaimed
her
son
,
starting
back
,
as
he
obeyed
her
,
and
disclosed
Jonathan
Wild
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
silent
,
"
said
Jonathan
,
in
a
menacing
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
seen
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Lady
Trafford
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
enemy
,
"
replied
her
son
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
enemy
!
<EOS>
"
she
returned
imperfectly
comprehending
him
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
Rowland
is
your
uncle
--
he
will
be
your
guardian
--
he
will
protect
you
.
<EOS>
Will
you
not
,
brother
?
"
 
"
Promise
,
"
said
a
deep
voice
in
Trenchard
's
ear
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
will
kill
me
,
"
cried
Thames
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
man
in
this
room
who
seeks
my
life
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Impossible
!
"
rejoined
his
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
at
these
fetters
,
"
returned
Thames
,
holding
up
his
manacled
wrists
;
"
they
were
put
on
by
my
uncle
's
command
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
shrieked
Lady
Trafford
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
a
moment
is
to
be
lost
,
"
whispered
Jonathan
to
Trenchard
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
life
--
or
yours
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
one
shall
harm
you
more
,
my
dear
,
"
cried
Lady
Trafford
.
<EOS>
"
Your
uncle
_
must
_
protect
you
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
his
interest
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
He
will
be
dependent
on
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
what
you
please
with
him
,
"
muttered
Trenchard
to
Wild
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
off
these
chains
,
Rowland
,
"
said
Lady
Trafford
,
"
instantly
,
I
command
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
_
<EOS>
I
_
<EOS>
will
,
"
replied
Jonathan
,
advancing
,
and
rudely
seizing
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mother
!
"
cried
the
son
,
"
help
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
this
?
"
shrieked
Lady
Trafford
,
raising
herself
on
the
couch
,
and
extending
her
hands
towards
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
God
!
<EOS>
would
you
take
him
from
me?--would
<EOS>
you
murder
him
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
His
father
's
name?--and
<EOS>
he
is
free
,
"
rejoined
Rowland
,
holding
her
arms
.
 
<EOS>
"
Release
him
first
--
and
I
will
disclose
it
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Lady
Trafford
;
"
on
my
soul
,
I
will
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Speak
then
!
"
returned
Rowland
.
 
<EOS>
"
Too
late
!
<EOS>
"
shrieked
the
lady
,
falling
heavily
backwards,--"too
late!--oh
!
"
 
<EOS>
Heedless
of
her
cries
,
Jonathan
passed
a
handkerchief
tightly
over
her
son
's
mouth
,
and
forced
him
out
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
returned
,
a
moment
or
so
afterwards
,
he
found
Sir
Rowland
standing
by
the
lifeless
body
of
his
sister
.
<EOS>
His
countenance
was
almost
as
white
and
rigid
as
that
of
the
corpse
by
his
side
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
your
work
,
"
said
the
knight
,
sternly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
entirely
,
"
replied
Jonathan
,
calmly
;
"
though
I
should
n't
be
ashamed
of
it
if
it
were
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
you
failed
in
obtaining
the
secret
from
her
,
Sir
Rowland
.
<EOS>
Women
are
hypocrites
to
the
last
--
true
only
to
themselves
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Peace
!
"
cried
the
knight
,
fiercely
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
offence
,
"
returned
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
merely
about
to
observe
that
_
I
_
am
in
possession
of
her
secret
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Did
n't
I
tell
you
that
the
fugitive
Darrell
gave
me
a
glove
!
<EOS>
But
we
'll
speak
of
this
hereafter
.
<EOS>
You
can
_
purchase
_
<EOS>
the
information
from
me
whenever
you
're
so
disposed
.
<EOS>
I
sha
n't
drive
a
hard
bargain
.
<EOS>
To
the
point
however
.
<EOS>
I
came
back
to
say
,
that
I
've
placed
your
nephew
in
a
coach
;
and
,
if
you
'll
be
at
my
lock
in
the
Old
Bailey
an
hour
after
midnight
,
you
shall
hear
the
last
tidings
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
there
,
"
answered
Trenchard
,
gloomily
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
'll
not
forget
the
thousand
,
Sir
Rowland
--
short
accounts
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Fear
nothing
.
<EOS>
You
shall
have
your
reward
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee,--thank'ee
.
<EOS>
My
house
is
the
next
door
to
the
Cooper
's
Arms
,
in
the
Old
Bailey
,
opposite
Newgate
.
<EOS>
You
'll
find
me
at
supper
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
bowed
and
departed
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
man
should
have
been
an
Italian
bravo
,
"
murmured
the
knight
,
sinking
into
a
chair
:
"
he
has
neither
fear
nor
compunction
.
<EOS>
Would
I
could
purchase
his
apathy
as
easily
as
I
can
procure
his
assistance
.
<EOS>
"
 
Soon
after
this
Mrs.
Norris
entered
the
room
,
followed
by
Father
Spencer
.
<EOS>
On
approaching
the
couch
,
they
found
Sir
Rowland
senseless
,
and
extended
over
the
dead
body
of
his
unfortunate
sister
.

CHAPTER
XI
.
 
<EOS>
The
Mohocks
.
  
<EOS>
Jonathan
Wild
,
meanwhile
,
had
quitted
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
found
a
coach
at
the
door
,
with
the
blinds
carefully
drawn
up
,
and
ascertained
from
a
tall
,
ill
-
looking
,
though
tawdrily
-
dressed
fellow
,
who
held
his
horse
by
the
bridle
,
and
whom
he
addressed
as
Quilt
Arnold
,
that
the
two
boys
were
safe
inside
,
in
the
custody
of
Abraham
Mendez
,
the
dwarfish
Jew
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
had
delivered
his
instructions
to
Quilt
,
who
,
with
Abraham
,
constituted
his
body
-
guard
,
or
janizaries
,
as
he
termed
them
,
Jonathan
mounted
his
steed
,
and
rode
off
at
a
gallop
.
<EOS>
Quilt
was
not
long
in
following
his
example
.
<EOS>
Springing
upon
the
box
,
he
told
the
coachman
to
make
the
best
of
his
way
to
Saint
Giles
's
.
<EOS>
Stimulated
by
the
promise
of
something
handsome
to
drink
,
the
man
acquitted
himself
to
admiration
in
the
management
of
his
lazy
cattle
.
<EOS>
Crack
went
the
whip
,
and
away
floundered
the
heavy
vehicle
through
the
deep
ruts
of
the
ill
-
kept
road
,
or
rather
lane
,
<EOS>
(
for
it
was
little
better
,
)
<EOS>
which
,
then
,
led
across
Southampton
Fields
.
<EOS>
Skirting
the
noble
gardens
of
Montague
House
,
(
now
,
we
need
scarcely
say
,
the
British
Museum
,
)
the
party
speedily
reached
Great
Russell
Street,--a
quarter
described
by
Strype
,
in
his
edition
of
old
Stow
's
famous
_
Survey
_
,
"
as
being
graced
with
the
best
buildings
in
all
Bloomsbury
,
and
the
best
inhabited
by
the
nobility
and
gentry
,
especially
the
north
side
,
as
having
gardens
behind
the
houses
,
and
the
prospect
of
the
pleasant
fields
up
to
Hampstead
and
Highgate
;
insomuch
that
this
place
,
by
physicians
,
is
esteemed
the
most
healthful
of
any
in
London
.
<EOS>
"
Neither
of
the
parties
outside
bestowed
much
attention
upon
these
stately
and
salubriously
-
situated
mansions
;
indeed
,
as
it
was
now
not
far
from
ten
o'clock
,
and
quite
dark
,
they
could
scarcely
discern
them
.
<EOS>
But
,
in
spite
of
his
general
insensibility
to
such
matters
,
Quilt
could
not
help
commenting
upon
the
delicious
perfume
wafted
from
the
numerous
flower
-
beds
past
which
they
were
driving
.
<EOS>
The
coachman
answered
by
a
surly
grunt
,
and
,
plying
his
whip
with
redoubled
zeal
,
shaped
his
course
down
Dyot
Street
;
traversed
that
part
of
Holborn
,
which
is
now
called
Broad
Street
,
and
where
two
ancient
alms
-
houses
were
,
then
,
standing
in
the
middle
of
that
great
thoroughfare
,
exactly
opposite
the
opening
of
Compston
Street
;
and
,
diving
under
a
wide
gateway
on
the
left
,
soon
reached
a
more
open
space
,
surrounded
by
mean
habitations
,
coach
-
houses
and
stables
,
called
Kendrick
Yard
,
at
the
further
end
of
which
Saint
Giles
's
round
-
house
was
situated
.
 
<EOS>
No
sooner
did
the
vehicle
turn
the
corner
of
this
yard
,
than
Quilt
became
aware
,
from
the
tumultuous
sounds
that
reached
his
ears
,
as
well
as
from
the
flashing
of
various
lanterns
at
the
door
of
the
round
-
house
,
that
some
disturbance
was
going
on
;
and
,
apprehensive
of
a
rescue
,
if
he
drew
up
in
the
midst
of
the
mob
,
he
thought
it
prudent
to
come
to
a
halt
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
he
stopped
the
coach
,
dismounted
,
and
hastened
towards
the
assemblage
,
which
,
he
was
glad
to
find
,
consisted
chiefly
of
a
posse
of
watchmen
and
other
guardians
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
Quilt
,
who
was
an
ardent
lover
of
mischief
,
could
not
help
laughing
most
heartily
at
the
rueful
appearance
of
these
personages
.
<EOS>
Not
one
of
them
but
bore
the
marks
of
having
been
engaged
in
a
recent
and
severe
conflict
.
<EOS>
Quarter
-
staves
,
bludgeons
,
brown
-
bills
,
lanterns
,
swords
,
and
sconces
were
alike
shivered
;
and
,
to
judge
from
the
sullied
state
of
their
habiliments
,
the
claret
must
have
been
tapped
pretty
freely
.
<EOS>
Never
was
heard
such
a
bawling
as
these
unfortunate
wights
kept
up
.
<EOS>
Oaths
exploded
like
shells
from
a
battery
in
full
fire
,
accompanied
by
threats
of
direst
vengeance
against
the
individuals
who
had
maltreated
them
.
<EOS>
Here
,
might
be
seen
a
poor
fellow
whose
teeth
were
knocked
down
his
throat
,
spluttering
out
the
most
tremendous
menaces
,
and
gesticulating
like
a
madman
:
there
,
another
,
whose
nose
was
partially
slit
,
vented
imprecations
and
lamentations
in
the
same
breath
.
<EOS>
On
the
right
,
stood
a
bulky
figure
,
with
a
broken
rattle
hanging
out
of
his
great
-
coat
pocket
,
who
held
up
a
lantern
to
his
battered
countenance
to
prove
to
the
spectators
that
both
his
orbs
of
vision
were
darkened
:
on
the
left
,
a
meagre
constable
had
divested
himself
of
his
shirt
,
to
bind
up
with
greater
convenience
a
gaping
cut
in
the
arm
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
,
the
Mohocks
have
been
at
work
,
I
perceive
,
"
remarked
Quilt
,
as
he
drew
near
the
group
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Faith
,
an
'
you
may
say
that
,
"
returned
a
watchman
,
who
was
wiping
a
ruddy
stream
from
his
brow
;
"
they
've
broken
the
paice
,
and
our
pates
into
the
bargain
.
<EOS>
But
shurely
I
'd
know
that
vice
,
"
he
added
,
turning
his
lantern
towards
the
janizary
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
Quilt
Arnold
,
my
man
,
is
it
you
?
<EOS>
By
the
powers
!
<EOS>
I
'm
glad
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
The
sight
<EOS>
o
'
your
'
andsome
phiz
allys
does
me
good
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
return
the
compliment
,
Terry
.
<EOS>
But
your
cracked
skull
is
by
no
means
a
pleasing
spectacle
.
<EOS>
How
came
you
by
the
hurt
,
eh
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
did
I
come
by
it?--that
's
a
nate
question
.
<EOS>
Why
,
honestly
enouch
.
<EOS>
It
was
lent
me
by
a
countryman
o
'
mine
;
but
I
paid
him
back
in
his
own
coin
--
ha
!
ha
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
countryman
of
yours
,
Terry
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
and
a
noble
one
,
too
<EOS>
,
Quilt
--
more
's
the
pity
!
<EOS>
You
've
heard
of
the
Marquis
of
Slaughterford
,
belike
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
;
who
has
not
?
<EOS>
He
's
the
leader
of
the
Mohocks
,
the
general
of
the
Scourers
,
the
prince
of
rakes
,
the
friend
of
the
surgeons
and
glaziers
,
the
terror
of
your
tribe
,
and
the
idol
of
the
girls
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
him
to
a
hair
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Terence
,
rapturously
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Och
!
<EOS>
he
's
a
broth
of
a
boy
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
thought
he
'd
broken
your
head
,
Terry
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Phooh
!
<EOS>
that
's
nothing
?
<EOS>
A
piece
<EOS>
o
'
plaster'll
set
all
to
rights
;
and
Terry
O'Flaherty
's
not
the
boy
to
care
for
the
stroke
of
a
supple
-
jack
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
did
n't
I
tell
you
that
I
giv
'
him
as
good
as
he
brought
--
and
better
!
<EOS>
I
jist
touched
him
with
my
'
Evenin
'
Star
,
'
as
I
call
this
shillelah
,
"
said
the
watchman
,
flourishing
an
immense
bludgeon
,
the
knob
of
which
appeared
to
be
loaded
with
lead
,
"
and
,
by
Saint
Patrick
!
<EOS>
down
he
cum'd
like
a
bullock
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Zounds
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Quilt
,
"
did
you
kill
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
quite
,
"
replied
Terence
,
laughing
;
"
but
I
brought
him
to
his
senses
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
By
depriving
him
of
'em
,
eh
!
<EOS>
But
I
'm
sorry
you
hurt
his
lordship
,
Terry
.
<EOS>
Young
noblemen
ought
to
be
indulged
in
their
frolics
.
<EOS>
If
they
_
do
_
,
now
and
then
,
run
away
with
a
knocker
,
paint
a
sign
,
beat
the
watch
,
or
huff
a
magistrate
,
they
_
pay
_
for
their
pastime
,
and
that
's
sufficient
.
<EOS>
What
more
could
any
reasonable
man
--
especially
a
watchman
--
desire
?
<EOS>
Besides
,
the
Marquis
,
is
a
devilish
fine
fellow
,
and
a
particular
friend
of
mine
.
<EOS>
There
's
not
his
peer
among
the
peerage
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Och
!
<EOS>
if
he
's
a
friend
<EOS>
o
'
yours
,
my
dear
joy
,
there
's
no
more
to
be
said
;
and
right
sorry
am

I
struck
him

<EOS>
But

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
--
wait
awhile
,
"
returned
Quilt
;
"
his
lordship
wo
n't
forget
you
.
<EOS>
He
's
as
generous
as
he
's
frolicsome
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
the
door
of
the
round
-
house
was
opened
,
and
a
stout
man
,
with
a
lantern
in
his
hand
,
presented
himself
at
the
threshold
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
Sharples
,
"
cried
Quilt
.
 
<EOS>
"
Whist
!
"
exclaimed
Terence
;
"
he
elevates
his
glim
.
<EOS>
By
Jasus
!
<EOS>
he
's
about
to
spake
to
us

"
 
<EOS>
"
Gem'men
o
'
the
votch

"
<EOS>
cried
Sharples
,
as
loudly
as
a
wheezy
cough
would
permit
him
,
"
my
noble
pris'ner
--
<EOS>
ough
!
<EOS>
ough;--the
<EOS>
Markis
o
'
<EOS>
Slaughterford----
"
 
Further
speech
was
cut
short
by
a
volley
of
execrations
from
the
angry
guardians
of
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
Mohocks
!
<EOS>
No
Scourers
!
"
cried
the
mob
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hear
!
<EOS>
hear
!
"
<EOS>
vociferated
Quilt
.
 
<EOS>
"
His
lordship
desires
me
to
say
--
ough
!
<EOS>
ough

"
 
<EOS>
Fresh
groans
and
hisses
.
 
<EOS>
"
Von't
you
hear
me?--ough
!
<EOS>
ough
!
<EOS>
"
demanded
Sharples
,
after
a
pause
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
all
means
,
"
rejoined
Quilt
.
 
<EOS>
"
Raise
your
vice
,
and
lave
off

"
added
Terence
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
long
and
the
short
o

<EOS>
the
matter
's
this
then
,
"
returned
Sharples
with
dignity
,
"
the
Markis
begs
<EOS>
your
acceptance
o
'
ten
guineas
to
drink
his
health
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
hooting
was
instantaneously
changed
to
cheers
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
his
lordship
,
furthermore
,
requests
me
to
state
,
"
proceeded
Sharples
,
in
a
hoarse
tone
,
"
that
he
'll
be
responsible
for
the
doctors
'
bill
of
all
such
gem'men
as

Hurrah

"
shouted
the
mob
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
're
all
damaged
--
we've
all
got
broken
pates
,
"
cried
a
dozen
voices
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
good
luck
to
him
!
<EOS>
so
we
have
,
"
rejoined
Terence
;
"
but
we
've
no
objection
to
take
out
the
dochter
's
bill
in
drink
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
None
whatever
,
"
replied
the
mob
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
answer
,
gem'men
?
"
demanded
Sharples
.
 
<EOS>
"
Long
life
to
the
Markis
,
and
we
accept
his
honourable
proposal
,
"
responded
the
mob
.
 
<EOS>
"
Long
life
to
the
Marquis
!
"
<EOS>
reiterated
Terence
;
"
he
's
an
honour
to
ould
Ireland
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Did
n't
I
tell
you
how
it
would
be
?
"
remarked
Quilt
.
 
<EOS>
"
Troth
,
and
so
did
you
,
"
returned
the
watchman
;
"
but
I
could
n't
belave
it
.
<EOS>
In
futur
'
,
I
'll
keep
the
'
Evenin
'
Star
'
for
his
lordship
's
enemies
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
'd
better
,
"
replied
Quilt
.
"
<EOS>
But
bring
your
glim
this
way
.
<EOS>
I
've
a
couple
of
kinchens
in
yonder
rattler
,
whom
I
wish
to
place
under
old
Sharples
's
care
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Be
handy
,
then
,
"
rejoined
Terence
,
"
or
,
I
'll
lose
my
share
of
the
smart
money
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
the
assistance
of
Terence
,
and
a
linkboy
who
volunteered
his
services
,
Quilt
soon
removed
the
prisoners
from
the
coach
,
and
leaving
Sheppard
to
the
custody
of
Abraham
,
proceeded
to
drag
Thames
towards
the
round
-
house
.
<EOS>
Not
a
word
had
been
exchanged
between
the
two
boys
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
Whenever
Jack
attempted
to
speak
,
he
was
checked
by
an
angry
growl
from
Abraham
;
and
Thames
,
though
his
heart
was
full
almost
to
bursting
,
felt
no
inclination
to
break
the
silence
.
<EOS>
His
thoughts
,
indeed
,
were
too
painful
for
utterance
,
and
so
acute
were
his
feelings
,
that
,
for
some
time
,
they
quite
overcame
him
.
<EOS>
But
his
grief
was
of
short
duration
.
<EOS>
The
elastic
spirits
of
youth
resumed
their
sway
;
and
,
before
the
coach
stopped
,
his
tears
had
ceased
to
flow
.
<EOS>
As
to
Jack
Sheppard
,
he
appeared
utterly
reckless
and
insensible
,
and
did
nothing
but
whistle
and
sing
the
whole
way
.
 
<EOS>
While
he
was
dragged
along
in
the
manner
just
described
,
Thames
looked
around
to
ascertain
,
if
possible
,
where
he
was
;
for
he
did
not
put
entire
faith
in
Jonathan
's
threat
of
sending
him
to
the
round
-
house
,
and
apprehensive
of
something
even
worse
than
imprisonment
.
<EOS>
The
aspect
of
the
place
,
so
far
as
he
could
discern
through
the
gloom
,
was
strange
to
him
;
but
chancing
to
raise
his
eyes
above
the
level
of
the
surrounding
habitations
,
he
beheld
,
relieved
against
the
sombre
sky
,
the
tall
steeple
of
Saint
Giles
's
church
,
the
precursor
of
the
present
structure
,
which
was
not
erected
till
some
fifteen
years
later
.
<EOS>
He
recognised
this
object
at
once
.
<EOS>
Jonathan
had
not
deceived
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
this
here
kinchen
_
in
_
for
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Terence
,
as
he
and
Quilt
strode
along
,
with
Thames
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
for
?
"
rejoined
Quilt
,
evasively
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
nothin'
partickler
--
mere
curossity
,
"
replied
Terence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
By
the
powers
!
"
he
added
,
turning
his
lantern
full
upon
the
face
of
the
captive
,
"
he
's
a
nice
genn
-
teel
-
lookin
'
kiddy
,
I
must
say
.
<EOS>
Pity
he
's
ta'en
to
bad
ways
so
airly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
spare
me
<EOS>
your
compassion
,
friend
,
"
observed
Thames
;
"
I
am
falsely
detained
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
rejoined
Quilt
,
maliciously
;
"
every
thief
is
so
.
<EOS>
If
we
were
to
wait
till
a
prig
was
rightfully
nabbed
,
we
might
tarry
till
doomsday
.
<EOS>
We
never
supposed
you
helped
yourself
to
a
picture
set
with
diamonds
--
not
we
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Is
the
guv'ner
consarned
in
this
job
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Terence
,
in
a
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
,
"
returned
Quilt
,
significantly
.
<EOS>
"
Zounds
!
<EOS>
what
's
that
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
as
the
noise
of
a
scuffle
was
heard
behind
them
.
"
<EOS>
The
other
kid
's
given
my
partner
the
slip
.
<EOS>
Here
,
take
this
youngster
,
Terry
;
my
legs
are
lighter
than
old
Nab
's
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
committing
Thames
to
the
care
of
the
watchman
,
he
darted
after
the
fugitive
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
wish
to
earn
a
rich
reward
,
my
good
friend
?
"
said
Thames
to
the
watchman
,
as
soon
as
they
were
left
alone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
it
by
lettin
'
<EOS>
you
go
,
my
darlin
'
,
that
I
'm
to
airn
it
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Terence
.
<EOS>
"
If
so
,
it
wo
n't
pay
.
<EOS>
You
're
Mister
Wild
's
pris'ner
,
and
worse
luck
to
it
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
ask
you
to
liberate
me
,
"
urged
Thames
;
"
but
will
you
convey
a
message
for
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Where
to
,
honey
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
To
Mr.
Wood
's
,
the
carpenter
in
Wych
Street
.
<EOS>
He
lives
near
the
Black
Lion
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
Black
Lion
!
"
echoed
Terence
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
the
house
well
;
by
the
same
token
that
it
's
a
flash
crib
.
<EOS>
Och
!
<EOS>
many
a
mug
o
'
bubb
<EOS>
have
I
drained
wi
'
the
landlord
,
Joe
Hind

<EOS>
And
so
Misther
Wudd
lives
near
the
Black
Lion
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
does
,
"
replied
Thames
.
<EOS>
"
Tell
him
that
I
--
his
adopted
son
,
Thames
Darrell
--
am
detained
here
by
Jonathan
Wild
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Thames
Ditton
--
is
that
your
name
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
the
boy
,
impatiently
;
"
Darrell
--
Thames
Darrell
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
not
forget
it
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
mighty
quare
'
un
,
though
.
<EOS>
I
never
yet
heard
of
a
Christians
as
was
named
after
the
Shannon
or
the
Liffy
;
and
the
Thames
is
no
better
than
a
dhurty
puddle
,
compared
wi
'
them
two
noble
strames
.
<EOS>
But
then
you
're
an
adopted
son
,
and
that
makes
all
the
difference
.
<EOS>
People
do
call
their
unlawful
children
strange
names
.
<EOS>
Are
you
quite
shure
<EOS>
you
have
n't
another
alyas
,
Masther
Thames
Ditton
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Darrell
,
I
tell
you
.
<EOS>
Will
you
go
?
<EOS>
You
'll
be
paid
handsomely
for
your
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mind
the
throuble
,
"
hesitated
Terence
,
who
was
really
a
good
-
hearted
fellow
at
the
bottom
;
"
<EOS>
and
I
'd
like
to
sarve
you
if
I
could
<EOS>
,
for
you
look
like
a
gentleman
's
son
,
and
that
goes
a
great
way
wi
'
me
.
<EOS>
But
if
Misther
Wild
were
to
find
out
that
I
thwarted
his
schames----
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'd
not
be
in
your
skin
for
a
trifle
,
<EOS>
"
interrupted
Quilt
,
who
having
secured
Sheppard
,
and
delivered
him
to
Abraham
,
now
approached
them
unawares
;
"
and
it
sha
n't
be
my
fault
if
he
do
n't
hear
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
'
Ouns
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Terence
,
in
alarm
,
"
would
you
turn
snitch
on
your
old
pal
,
Quilt
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
if
he
plays
a

cross
,
"
returned
Quilt
.
<EOS>
"
Come
along
,
my
sly
shaver
.
<EOS>
With
all
your
cunning
,
we
're
more
than
a
match
for
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
not
for
me
,
"
growled
Terence
,
in
an
under
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Remember
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Quilt
,
as
he
forced
the
captive
along
.
 
<EOS>
"
Remember
the
devil
!
"
<EOS>
retorted
Terence
,
who
had
recovered
his
natural
audacity
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
think
I
'm
afeard
of
a
beggarly
thief
-
taker
and
his
myrmidons
?
<EOS>
Not
I.
Master
Thames
Ditton
,
I
'll
do
your
biddin

;
and
you

Misther
Quilt
Arnold

may
do
your
worst
<EOS>
,
I

you

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Dog
!
"
exclaimed
Quilt
,
turning
fiercely
upon
him
,
"
do
you
threaten
?
"
 
<EOS>
But
the
watchman
eluded
his
grasp
,
and
,
mingling
with
the
crowd
,
disappeared

CHAPTER
XII
.
 
<EOS>
Saint
Giles
's
Round
-
house
.
  
<EOS>
Saint
Giles
's
Round
-
house
was
an
old
detached
fabric
,
standing
in
an
angle
of
Kendrick
Yard
.
<EOS>
Originally
built
,
as
its
name
imports
,
in
a
cylindrical
form
,
like
a
modern
Martello
tower
,
it
had
undergone
,
from
time
to
time
,
so
many
alterations
,
that
its
symmetry
was
,
in
a
great
measure
,
destroyed
.
<EOS>
Bulging
out
more
in
the
middle
than
at
the
two
extremities
,
it
resembled
an
enormous
cask
set
on
its
end,--a
sort
of
Heidelberg
tun
on
a
large
scale,--and
<EOS>
this
resemblance
was
increased
by
the
small
circular
aperture
--
it
hardly
deserved
to
be
called
a
door
--
pierced
,
like
the
bung
-
hole
of
a
barrell
,
through
the
side
of
the
structure
,
at
some
distance
from
the
ground
,
and
approached
by
a
flight
of
wooden
steps
.
<EOS>
The
prison
was
two
stories
high
,
with
a
flat
roof
surmounted
by
a
gilt
vane
fashioned
like
a
key
;
and
,
possessing
considerable
internal
accommodation
,
it
had
,
in
its
day
,
lodged
some
thousands
of
disorderly
personages
.
<EOS>
The
windows
were
small
,
and
strongly
grated
,
looking
,
in
front
,
on
Kendrick
Yard
,
and
,
at
the
back
,
upon
the
spacious
burial
-
ground
of
Saint
Giles
's
Church
.
<EOS>
Lights
gleamed
from
the
lower
rooms
,
and
,
on
a
nearer
approach
to
the
building
,
the
sound
of
revelry
might
be
heard
from
within
.
 
<EOS>
Warned
of
the
approach
of
the
prisoners
by
the
increased
clamour
,
Sharples
,
who
was
busied
in
distributing
the
Marquis
's
donation
,
affected
to
throw
the
remainder
of
the
money
among
the
crowd
,
though
,
in
reality
,
he
kept
back
a
couple
of
guineas
,
which
he
slipped
into
his
sleeve
,
and
running
hastily
up
the
steps
,
unlocked
the
door
.
<EOS>
He
was
followed
,
more
leisurely
,
by
the
prisoners
;
and
,
during
their
ascent
,
Jack
Sheppard
made
a
second
attempt
to
escape
by
ducking
suddenly
down
,
and
endeavouring
to
pass
under
his
conductor
's
legs
.
<EOS>
The
dress
of
the
dwarfish
Jew
was
not
,
however
,
favourable
to
this
expedient
.
<EOS>
Jack
was
caught
,
as
in
a
trap
,
by
the
pendant
tails
of
Abraham
's
long
frock
;
and
,
instead
of
obtaining
his
release
by
his
ingenuity
,
he
only
got
a
sound
thrashing
.
 
<EOS>
Sharples
received
them
at
the
threshold
,
and
holding
his
lantern
towards
the
prisoners
to
acquaint
himself
with
their
features
,
nodded
to
Quilt
,
between
whom
and
himself
some
secret
understanding
seemed
to
subsist
,
and
then
closed
and
barred
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
Vell
,
"
he
growled
,
addressing
Quilt
,
"
you
know
who
's
here
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
 
"
To
be
sure
I
do
,
"
replied
Quilt
;
"
my
noble
friend
,
the
Marquis
of
Slaughterford
.
<EOS>
What
of
that
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Vot
'
o
that
!
"
echoed
Sharples
,
peevishly
:
"
Everythin
'
.
<EOS>
Vot
am
I
to
do
vith
these
young
imps
,
eh
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
you
generally
do
with
your
prisoners
,
Mr.
Sharples
,
"
replied
Quilt
;
"
lock
'em
up
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
easily
said
.
<EOS>
But
,
suppose
I
've
no
place
to
lock
'em
up
in
,
how
then
?
"
 
<EOS>
Quilt
looked
a
little
perplexed
.
<EOS>
He
passed
his
arm
under
that
of
the
constable
,
and
drew
him
aside
.
 
<EOS>
"
Vell
,
vell
,
"
growled
Sharples
,
after
he
had
listened
to
the
other
's
remonstrances
,
"
it
shall
be
done
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
confounded
inconvenient
.
<EOS>
One
do
n't
often
get
sich
a
vindfal
as
<EOS>
the
Markis----
"
 
"
Or
such
a
customer
as
Mr.
Wild
,
"
edged
in
Quilt
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
then
,
Saint
Giles
!
"
<EOS>
interposed
Sheppard
,
"
are
we
to
be
kept
here
all
night
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Eh
day
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Sharples
:
"
wot
new
-
fledged
bantam
's
this
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
One
that
wants
to
go
to
roost
,
"
replied
Sheppard
.
"
<EOS>
So
,
stir
your
stumps
,
Saint
Giles
;
and
,
if
you
mean
to
lock
us
up
,
use
despatch
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Comin
'
!
<EOS>
comin
'
!
<EOS>
"
returned
the
constable
,
shuffling
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Coming!--so
is
midnight
--
so
is
Jonathan
Wild
,
"
retorted
Jack
,
with
a
significant
look
at
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
never
an
out
-
o
-
the
-
vay
corner
,
into
vich
you
could
shtow
these
troublesome
warmint
?
"
<EOS>
observed
Abraham
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
guv'ner'll
be
here
afore
midnight
.
"
 
<EOS>
Darrell
's
attention
was
drawn
to
the
latter
part
of
this
speech
by
a
slight
pressure
on
his
foot
.
<EOS>
And
,
turning
at
the
touch
,
he
perceived
Sheppard
's
glance
fixed
meaningly
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stow
it
,
Nab
!
"
exclaimed
Quilt
,
angrily
;
"
the
kinchen
's
awake
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>

Awake!--to
be
sure
I
am
,
my
flash
cove
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Sheppard
;
"
I
'm
down
as
a
hammer
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
just
bethought
me
of
a
crib
<EOS>
as'll
serve
their
turn
,
"
interposed
Sharples
,
"
at
any
rate
,
they
'll
be
out
<EOS>
o
'
the
vay
,
and
as
safe
as
two
chicks
in
a
coop
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Lead
the
way
to
it
then
,
Saint
Giles
,
"
said
Jack
,
in
a
tone
of
mock
authority
.
 
<EOS>
The
place
,
in
which
they
stood
,
was
a
small
entrance
-
chamber
,
cut
off
,
like
the
segment
of
a
circle
,
from
the
main
apartment
,
(
of
which
it
is
needless
to
say
it
originally
constituted
a
portion
,
)
by
a
stout
wooden
partition
.
<EOS>
A
door
led
to
the
inner
room
;
and
it
was
evident
from
the
peals
of
merriment
,
and
other
noises
,
that
,
ever
and
anon
,
resounded
from
within
,
that
this
chamber
was
occupied
by
the
Marquis
and
his
friends
.
<EOS>
Against
the
walls
hung
an
assortment
of
staves
,
brown
-
bills
,
(
weapons
then
borne
by
the
watch
,
)
muskets
,
handcuffs
,
great
-
coats
,
and
lanterns
.
<EOS>
In
one
angle
of
the
room
stood
a
disused
fire
-
place
,
with
a
rusty
grate
and
broken
chimney
-
piece
;
in
the
other
there
was
a
sort
of
box
,
contrived
between
the
wall
and
the
boards
<EOS>
,
that
looked
like
an
apology
for
a
cupboard
.
<EOS>
Towards
this
box
Sharples
directed
his
steps
,
and
,
unlocking
a
hatch
in
the
door
,
disclosed
a
recess
scarcely
as
large
,
and
certainly
not
as
clean
,
as
a
dog
-
kennel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Vill
this
do
?
"
demanded
the
constable
,
taking
the
candle
from
the
lantern
,
the
better
to
display
the
narrow
limits
of
the
hole
.
<EOS>
"
I
call
this
ere
crib
the
Little
-
Ease
,
arter
the
runaway
prentices
'
cells
in
Guildhall
.
<EOS>
I
_
have
_
squeezed
three
kids
into
it
afore
now
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
"
he
added
,
lowering
his
tone
,
"
they
wos
little
'
uns
,
and
one
on
'em
was
smothered
--
ough
!
<EOS>
ough!--how
this
cough
chokes
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
Sheppard
,
meanwhile
,
whose
hands
were
at
liberty
,
managed
to
possess
himself
,
unperceived
,
of
the
spike
of
a
halbert
,
which
was
lying
,
apart
from
the
pole
,
upon
a
bench
near
him
.
<EOS>
Having
secured
this
implement
,
he
burst
from
his
conductor
,
and
,
leaping
into
the
hatch
,
as
clowns
generally
spring
into
the
clock
-
faces
,
when
in
pursuit
of
harlequin
in
the
pantomime,--that
is
,
back
foremost,--broke
into
a
fit
of
loud
and
derisive
laughter
,
kicking
his
heels
merrily
all
the
time
against
the
boards
.
<EOS>
His
mirth
,
however
,
received
an
unpleasant
check
;
for
Abraham
,
greatly
incensed
by
his
previous
conduct
,
caught
him
by
the
legs
,
and
pushed
him
with
such
violence
into
the
hole
that
the
point
of
the
spike
,
which
he
had
placed
in
his
pocket
,
found
its
way
through
his
clothes
to
the
flesh
,
inflicting
a
slight
,
but
painful
wound
.
<EOS>
Jack
,
who
had
something
of
the
Spartan
in
his
composition
,
endured
his
martyrdom
without
flinching
;
and
carried
his
stoical
indifference
so
far
,
as
even
to
make
a
mocking
grimace
in
Sharples
's
face
,
while
that
amiable
functionary
thrust
Thames
into
the
recess
beside
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
go
you
like
your
quarters
,
sauce
-
box
?
"
asked
Sharples
,
in
a
jeering
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Better
than
your
company
,
Saint
Giles
,
"
replied
Sheppard
;
"
so
,
shut
the
door
,
and
make
yourself
scarce
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
boy'll
never
rest
till
he
finds
his
vay
to
Bridewell
,
"
observed
Sharples
.
 
<EOS>
"
Or
the
street
,
"
returned
Jack
:
"
<EOS>
mind
my
words
,
the
prison
's
not
built
that
can
keep
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
'll
see
that
,
young
hempseed
,
"
replied
Sharples
,
shutting
the
hatch
furiously
in
his
face
,
and
locking
it
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
get
out
o
'
that
cage
,
I
'll
forgive
you
.
<EOS>
Now
,
come
along
,
gem'men
,
and
I
'll
show
you
some
precious
sport
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
two
janizaries
followed
him
as
far
as
the
entrance
to
the
inner
room
,
when
Abraham
,
raising
his
finger
to
his
lips
,
and
glancing
significantly
in
the
direction
of
the
boys
,
to
explain
his
intention
to
his
companions
,
closed
the
door
after
them
,
and
stole
softly
back
again
,
planting
himself
near
the
recess
.
 
<EOS>
For
a
few
minutes
all
was
silent
.
<EOS>
At
length
Jack
Sheppard
<EOS>
observed:--"The
coast
's
clear
.
<EOS>
They
're
gone
into
the
next
room
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Darrell
returned
no
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
angry
with
me
,
Thames
,
"
continued
Sheppard
,
in
a
tone
calculated
,
as
he
thought
,
to
appease
his
companion
's
indignation
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
all
for
the
best
,
as
I
'll
explain
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
reproach
you
,
Jack
,
"
said
the
other
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
done
with
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
quite
,
I
hope
,
"
rejoined
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
At
all
events
,
I
've
not
done
with
you
.
<EOS>
If
you
owe
your
confinement
to
me
,
you
shall
owe
your
liberation
to
me
,
also
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'd
rather
lie
here
for
ever
,
than
be
indebted
to
_
you
_
for
my
freedom
,
"
returned
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
done
nothing
to
offend
you
,
"
persisted
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
!
"
echoed
the
other
,
scornfully
.
<EOS>
"
You
've
perjured
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
my
own
concern
,
"
rejoined
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
An
oath
weighs
little
with
me
,
compared
with
your
safety
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
more
of
this
,
"
interrupted
Thames
,
"
you
make
the
matter
worse
by
these
excuses
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Quarrel
with
me
as
much
as
you
please
,
Thames
,
but
hear
me
,
"
returned
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
I
took
the
course
I
pursued
to
serve
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Tush
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Thames
;
"
you
accused
me
to
skreen
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
On
my
soul
,
Thames
,
you
wrong
me
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Jack
,
passionately
.
<EOS>
"
I
'd
lay
down
my
life
for
yours
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
expect
me
to
believe
you
after
what
has
passed
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
;
and
,
more
than
that
<EOS>
,
I
expect
you
to
thank
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
For
procuring
my
imprisonment
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
For
saving
your
life
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Listen
to
me
,
Thames
.
<EOS>
You
're
in
a
more
serious
scrape
than
you
imagine
.
<EOS>
I
overheard
Jonathan
Wild
's
instructions
to
Quilt
Arnold
,
and
though
he
spoke
in
slang
,
and
in
an
under
tone
,
my
quick
ears
,
and
acquaintance
with
the
thieves
'
lingo
,
enabled
me
to
make
out
every
word
he
uttered
.
<EOS>
Jonathan
is
in
league
with
Sir
Rowland
to
make
away
with
you
.
<EOS>
You
are
brought
here
that
their
designs
may
be
carried
into
effect
with
greater
security
.
<EOS>
Before
morning
,
unless
,
we
can
effect
an
escape
,
you
'll
be
kidnapped
,
or
murdered
,
and
your
disappearance
attributed
to
the
negligence
of
the
constable
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
sure
of
this
?
"
asked
Thames
,
who
,
though
as
brave
a
lad
as
need
be
,
could
not
repress
a
shudder
at
the
intelligence
.
 
<EOS>
"
Certain
.
<EOS>
The
moment
I
entered
the
room
,
and
found
you
a
prisoner
in
the
hands
of
Jonathan
Wild
,
I
guessed
how
matters
stood
,
and
acted
accordingly
.
<EOS>
Things
have
n't
gone
quite
as
smoothly
as
I
anticipated
;
but
they
might
have
been
worse
.
<EOS>
I
_
can
_
save
you
,
and
_
will
_
<EOS>
.
<EOS>
But
,
say
we
're
friends
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
not
deceiving
me
!
"
<EOS>
said
Thames
,
doubtfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
,
by
Heaven
!
"
replied
Sheppard
,
firmly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
swear
,
Jack
,
or
<EOS>
I
shall
distrust
you
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
give
you
my
hand
;
but
you
may
take
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
!
<EOS>
thank
you
!
"
<EOS>
faltered
Jack
,
in
a
voice
full
of
emotion
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
soon
free
you
from
these
bracelets
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
need
n't
trouble
yourself
,
"
replied
Thames
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Wood
will
be
here
presently
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Wood
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Jack
,
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
How
have
you
managed
to
communicate
with
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
Abraham
,
who
had
listened
attentively
to
the
foregoing
<EOS>
conversation,--not
a
word
of
which
escaped
him,--now
drew
in
his
breath
,
and
brought
his
ear
closer
to
the
boards
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
means
of
the
watchman
who
had
the
charge
of
me
,
"
replied
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
"
Curse
him
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
Abraham
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hist
!
"
exclaimed
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
I
heard
a
noise
.
<EOS>
Speak
lower
.
<EOS>
Somebody
may
be
on
the
watch
--
perhaps
,
that
old
ginger
-
hackled
Jew
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
if
he
is
,
"
rejoined
Thames
,
boldly
.
<EOS>
"
He
'll
learn
that
his
plans
will
be
defeated
.
"
 
"
He
may
learn
how
to
defeat
yours
,
"
replied
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
he
may
,
"
rejoined
Abraham
,
aloud
,
"
so
he
may
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Death
and
fiends
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Jack
;
"
the
old
thief
_
is
_
there
.
<EOS>
I
knew
it
.
<EOS>
You
've
betrayed
yourself
,
Thames
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Vot
o

that

"
chuckled
Abraham
.
"
<EOS>
_
You
_
can
shave
him
,
you
know

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
_
can
_
,
"
rejoined
Jack
;
"
and
<EOS>
you
,
too
,
old
Aaron
,
if
I
'd
a
razor
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
soon
do
you
expect
Mishter
Vudd
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
janizary
,
tauntingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
to
you
?
"
<EOS>
retorted
Jack
,
surlily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Because
I
should
n't
like
to
be
out
o
'
<EOS>
the
vay
<EOS>
ven
<EOS>

arrives

"
returned
Abraham
,
in
a
jeering
tone
;
"
it
vouldn't
be
vell
bred
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Vouldn't
it

"
<EOS>
replied
Jack
,
mimicking
his
snuffling
voice
;
"
then
shtay
vere
you
are
,
and
be
cursed
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
up

"
muttered
Thames
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Wood
will
be
intercepted
.
<EOS>
I
've
destroyed
my
only
chance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
your
_
only
_
chance
,
Thames
,
"
returned
Jack
,
in
the
same
undertone
;
"
but
your
best
.
<EOS>
Never
mind
.
<EOS>
We
'll
turn
the
tables
upon
'em
yet
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
we
could
manage
that
old
clothesman
between
us
,
if
we
got
out
of
this
box
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'd
manage
him
myself
,
if
my
arms
were
free
,
"
replied
Thames
,
boldly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shpeak
up
,
vill
you
?
"
cried
Abraham
,
rapping
his
knuckles
against
the
hatch
.
<EOS>
"
I
likes
to
hear
vot
<EOS>
you
says
.
<EOS>
You
_
can
_
have
no
shecrets
from

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Vy
do

you
talk
to
your
partner
,
or
Saint
Giles
,
if
you
vant
conversation
,
Aaron
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Jack
,
slyly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Because
they
're
in
the
next
room
,
and
the
door
's
shut
;
that
's
vy
,
my
jack
-
a

dandy

"
<EOS>
replied
Abraham
,
unsuspiciously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
they
are
--
are
they
?
"
<EOS>
muttered
Jack
,
triumphantly
;
"
that
'll
do
.
<EOS>
Now
for
it
,
Thames
!
<EOS>
Make
as
great
a
row
as
you
can
to
divert
his
attention
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
he
drew
the
spike
from
his
pocket
;
and
,
drowning
the
sound
of
the
operation
by
whistling
,
singing
,
shuffling
,
and
other
noises
,
contrived
,
in
a
few
minutes
,
to
liberate
his
companion
from
the
handcuffs
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Jack
,
"
cried
Thames
,
warmly
grasping
Sheppard
's
hand
,
"
you
are
my
friend
again
.
<EOS>
I
freely
forgive
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
Sheppard
cordially
returned
the
pressure
;
and
,
cautioning
Thames
,
"
not
to
let
the
ruffles
drop
,
or
they
might
tell
a
tale
,
"
began
to
warble
the
following
fragment
of
a
robber
melody:--
     
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
give
me
a
chisel
,
a
knife
,
or
a
file
,
    
And
<EOS>
the
dubsmen
shall
find
that
I
'll

"
 
"
Vot
the

you
about

noisy

"
<EOS>
inquired
Abraham
.
 
<EOS>
"
Practising

Aaron

"
replied
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
Vot
are
you

"
 
<EOS>
"
Practising
patience

"
growled
Abraham
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
before
it
's
needed
,
"
returned
Jack
,
aloud
;
adding
in
a
whisper
,
"
get
upon

Thames

<EOS>
Now
you

When
the
turnkey
,
next
morning
,
stepp'd
into
his
room
,
    
The
sight
of
the
hole
in
the
wall
struck
him
dumb
;
    
The
sheriff
's
black
bracelets
lay
strewn
on

But
the

As
Jack
concluded
his
ditty
,
the
door
flew
open
with
a
crash
,
and
Thames
sprang
through
the
aperture
.
 
<EOS>
This
manoeuvre
was
so
suddenly
executed
that
it
took
Abraham
completely
by
surprise
.
<EOS>
He
was
standing
at
the
moment
close
to
the
hatch
,
with
his
ear
at
the
keyhole
,
and
received
a
severe
blow
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
He
staggered
back
a
few
paces
;
and
,
before
he
could
recover
himself
,
Thames
tripped
up
his
heels
,
and
,
placing
the
point
of
the
spike
at
his
throat
,
threatened
to
stab
him
if
he
attempted
to
stir
,
or
cry
out
.
<EOS>
Nor
had
Jack
been
idle
all
this
time
.
<EOS>
Clearing
the
recess
the
instant
after
his
companion
,
he
flew
to
the
door
of
the
inner
room
,
and
,
locking
it
,
took
out
the
key
.
<EOS>
The
policy
of
this
step
was
immediately
apparent
.
<EOS>
Alarmed
by
the
noise
of
the
scuffle
,
Quilt
and
Sharples
rushed
to
the
assistance
of
their
comrade
.
<EOS>
But
they
were
too
late
.
<EOS>
The
entrance
was
barred
against
them
;
and
they
had
the
additional
mortification
of
hearing
Sheppard
's
loud
laughter
at
their
discomfiture
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
the
prison
was
n't
built
that
could
hold
me
,
"
cried
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
not
out
yet
,
<EOS>
you
young
hound
,
"
rejoined
Quilt
,
striving
ineffectually
to
burst
open
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
soon
shall
be
,
"
returned
Jack
;
"
take
these
,
"
he
added
,
flinging
the
handcuffs
against
the
wooden
partition
,
"
and
wear
'em
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Halloo
,
Nab

"
<EOS>
vociferated
Quilt
.
<EOS>
"
What
the
devil
are
you
about

<EOS>
Will
you
allow
yourself
to
be
beaten
by
a
couple
of
kids
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
if
I
can
help
it
,
"
returned
Abraham
,
making
a
desperate
effort
to
regain
his
feet
.
<EOS>
"
By
my
shalvation
,
boy
,
"
he
added
,
fiercely
,
"
if
you
do
n't
take
your
hande
off
my
peard
,
I
'll
sthrangle
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Help
me
,
Jack
!
"
<EOS>
shouted
Thames
,
"
or
I
sha
n't
be
able
to
keep
the
villain
down
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Stick
the
spike
into
him
,
then
,
"
returned
Sheppard
,
coolly
,
"
while
I
unbar
the
outlet
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
But
Thames
had
no
intention
of
following
his
friend
's
advice
.
<EOS>
Contenting
himself
with
brandishing
the
weapon
in
the
Jew
's
eyes
,
he
exerted
all
his
force
to
prevent
him
from
rising
.
 
<EOS>
While
this
took
place
,
while
Quilt
thundered
at
the
inner
door
,
and
Jack
drew
back
the
bolts
of
the
outer
,
a
deep
,
manly
voice
was
heard
chanting
--
as
if
in
contempt
of
the
general
uproar
--
the
following
strain:--
     
With
pipe
and
punch
upon
the
board
,
      
And
smiling
nymphs
around
us
;
    
No

"
chorussed
Sheppard
,
as
the
last
bar
yielded
to
his
efforts
.
"
<EOS>
Hurrah

<EOS>
come
along
,
Thames
;
we
're

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not

"
<EOS>
cried
Abraham
,
struggling
with
Thames
,
and
detaining
him
;
"
if
you
go
,
you
musht
take
me
along
vid
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Save
yourself

Jack
!
"
<EOS>
shouted
Thames
,
sinking
beneath
the
superior
weight
and
strength
of
his
opponent
;
"
leave
me
to
my
fate
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
,
"
replied
Jack
,
hurrying
towards
him
.
<EOS>
And
,
snatching
the
spike
from
Thames
,
he
struck
the
janizary
a
severe
blow
on
the
head
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
make
sure
work
this
time
,
"
he
added
,
about
to
repeat
the
blow
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hold
!
"
<EOS>
interposed
Thames
,
"
he
can
do
no
more
mischief
.
<EOS>
Let
us
be
gone
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
As
you
please
,
"
returned
Jack
,
leaping
up
;
"
but
I
feel
devilishly
inclined
to
finish
him
.
<EOS>
However
,
it
would
only
be
robbing
the
hangman
of
his
dues
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
he
was
preparing
to
follow
his
friend
,
when
their
egress
was
prevented
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
Jonathan
Wild
and
Blueskin
.

CHAPTER
XIII
.
 
<EOS>
The
Magdalene
.
  
<EOS>
The
household
of
the
worthy
carpenter
,
it
may
be
conceived
,
was
thrown
into
the
utmost
confusion
and
distress
by
the
unaccountable
disappearance
of
the
two
boys
.
<EOS>
As
time
wore
on
,
and
they
did
not
return
,
Mr.
Wood
's
anxiety
grew
so
insupportable
,
that
he
seized
his
hat
with
the
intention
of
sallying
forth
in
search
of
them
,
though
he
did
not
know
whither
to
bend
his
steps
,
when
his
departure
was
arrested
by
a
gentle
knock
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
he
is
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Winifred
,
starting
up
,
joyfully
,
and
proving
by
the
exclamation
that
her
thoughts
were
dwelling
upon
one
subject
only
.
<EOS>
"
There
he
is
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
fear
not
,
"
said
her
father
,
with
a
doubtful
shake
of
the
head
.
<EOS>
"
Thames
would
let
himself
in
;
and
Jack
generally
finds
an
entrance
through
the
backdoor
or
the
shop
-
window
,
when
he
has
been
out
at
untimely
hours
.
<EOS>
But
,
go
and
see
who
it
is
,
love
.
<EOS>
Stay
!
<EOS>
I
'll
go
myself
.
"
 
<EOS>
His
daughter
,
however
,
anticipated
him
.
<EOS>
She
flew
to
the
door
,
but
returned
the
next
minute
,
looking
deeply
disappointed
,
and
bringing
the
intelligence
that
it
was
"
only
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Who
?
"
almost
screamed
Mrs.
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
"
Jack
Sheppard
's
mother
,
"
answered
the
little
girl
,
dejectedly
;
"
she
has
brought
a
basket
of
eggs
from
Willesden
,
and
some
flowers
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
For
me
!
"
<EOS>
vociferated
Mrs.
Wood
,
in
indignant
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Eggs
for
me
!
<EOS>
You
mistake
,
child
.
<EOS>
They
must
be
for
your
father
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
'm
quite
sure
she
said
they
're
for
you
,
"
replied
Winifred
;
"
but
she
_
does
_
want
to
see
father
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
as
much
,
"
sneered
Mrs.
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
to
her
directly
,
"
said
Wood
,
bustling
towards
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
she
has
called
to
inquire
about
Jack
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
no
such
thing
,
"
interposed
his
better
half
,
authoritatively
;
"
remain
where
you
are
,
Sir
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
At
all
events
,
let
me
send
her
away
,
my
dear
,
"
supplicated
the
carpenter
,
anxious
to
avert
the
impending
storm
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
hear
me
?
"
cried
the
lady
,
with
increasing
vehemence
.
"
<EOS>
Stir
a
foot
,
at
your
peril
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
,
my
love
,
"
still
remonstrated
Wood
,
"
you
know
I
'm
going
to
look
after
the
boys----
<EOS>
"
 
"
After
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
you
mean
,
Sir
,
"
interrupted
his
wife
,
ironically
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
think
to
deceive
me
by
your
false
pretences
.
<EOS>
Marry
,
come
up
!
<EOS>
I
'm
not
so
easily
deluded
.
<EOS>
Sit
down
,
I
command
you
.
<EOS>
Winny
,
show
the
person
into
this
room
.
<EOS>
I
'll
see
her
myself
;
and
that
's
more
than
she
bargained
for
,
I
'll
be
sworn
.
"
 
<EOS>
Finding
it
useless
to
struggle
further
,
Mr.
Wood
sank
,
submissively
,
into
a
chair
,
while
his
daughter
hastened
to
execute
her
arbitrary
parent
's
commission
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
length
,
I
have
my
wish
,
"
continued
Mrs.
Wood
,
regarding
her
husband
with
a
glance
of
vindictive
triumph
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
behold
the
shameless
hussy
,
face
to
face
;
and
,
if
I
find
her
as
good
-
looking
as
she
's
represented
,
I
do
n't
know
what
I
'll
do
in
the
end
;
but
I
'll
begin
by
scratching
her
eyes
out
.
"
 
<EOS>
In
this
temper
,
it
will
naturally
be
imagined
,
that
Mrs.
Wood
's
reception
of
the
widow
,
who
,
at
that
moment
,
was
ushered
into
the
room
by
Winifred
,
was
not
particularly
kind
and
encouraging
.
<EOS>
As
she
approached
,
the
carpenter
's
wife
eyed
her
from
head
to
foot
,
in
the
hope
of
finding
something
in
her
person
or
apparel
to
quarrel
with
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
disappointed
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Sheppard
's
dress
--
extremely
neat
and
clean
,
but
simply
fashioned
,
and
of
the
plainest
and
most
unpretending
material,--offered
nothing
assailable
;
and
her
demeanour
was
so
humble
,
and
her
looks
so
modest
,
that
--
if
she
had
been
ill
-
looking
--
she
might
,
possibly
,
have
escaped
the
shafts
of
malice
preparing
to
be
levelled
against
her
.
<EOS>
But
,
alas
!
<EOS>
she
was
beautiful
--
and
beauty
is
a
crime
not
to
be
forgiven
by
a
jealous
woman
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
lapse
of
time
and
change
of
circumstances
have
wrought
a
remarkable
alteration
in
the
appearance
of
the
poor
widow
,
it
may
not
be
improper
to
notice
it
here
.
<EOS>
When
first
brought
under
consideration
,
she
was
a
miserable
and
forlorn
object
;
squalid
in
attire
,
haggard
in
looks
,
and
emaciated
in
frame
.
<EOS>
Now
,
she
was
the
very
reverse
of
all
this
.
<EOS>
Her
dress
,
it
has
just
been
said
,
was
neatness
and
simplicity
itself
.
<EOS>
Her
figure
,
though
slight
,
had
all
the
fulness
of
health
;
and
her
complexion
--
still
pale
,
but
without
its
former
sickly
cast,--contrasted
agreeably
,
by
its
extreme
fairness
,
with
the
dark
brows
and
darker
lashes
that
shaded
eyes
which
,
if
they
had
lost
some
of
their
original
brilliancy
,
had
gained
infinitely
more
in
the
soft
and
chastened
lustre
that
replaced
it
.
<EOS>
One
marked
difference
between
the
poor
outcast
,
who
,
oppressed
by
poverty
,
and
stung
by
shame
,
had
sought
temporary
relief
in
the
stupifying
draught,--that
worst
"
medicine
of
a
mind
diseased,"--and
those
of
the
same
being
,
freed
from
her
vices
,
and
restored
to
comfort
and
contentment
,
if
not
to
happiness
,
by
a
more
prosperous
course
of
events
,
was
exhibited
in
the
mouth
.
<EOS>
For
the
fresh
and
feverish
hue
of
lip
which
years
ago
characterised
this
feature
,
was
now
substituted
a
pure
and
wholesome
bloom
,
evincing
a
total
change
of
habits
;
and
,
though
the
coarse
character
of
the
mouth
remained
,
in
some
degree
,
unaltered
,
it
was
so
modified
in
expression
,
that
it
could
no
longer
be
accounted
a
blemish
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
the
whole
face
had
undergone
a
transformation
.
<EOS>
All
its
better
points
were
improved
,
while
the
less
attractive
ones
(
and
they
were
few
in
comparison
)
were
subdued
,
or
removed
.
<EOS>
What
was
yet
more
worthy
of
note
was
,
that
the
widow
's
countenance
had
an
air
of
refinement
about
it
,
of
which
it
was
utterly
destitute
before
,
and
which
seemed
to
intimate
that
her
true
position
in
society
was
far
above
that
wherein
accident
had
placed
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
"
said
the
carpenter
,
advancing
to
meet
her
,
and
trying
to
look
as
cheerful
and
composed
as
he
could
;
"
what
brings
you
to
town
,
<EOS>
eh?--Nothing
amiss
,
I
trust
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
<EOS>
whatever
,
Sir
,
"
answered
the
widow
.
<EOS>
"
A
neighbour
offered
me
a
drive
to
Paddington
;
and
,
as
I
have
n't
heard
of
my
son
for
some
time
,
I
could
n't
resist
the
temptation
of
stepping
on
to
inquire
after
him
,
and
to
thank
you
for
your
great
goodness
to
us
both
<EOS>
,
I
've
brought
a
little
garden
-
stuff
and
a
few
new
-
laid
eggs
for
you
,
Ma'am
,
"
she
added
turning
to
Mrs.
Wood
,
who
appeared
to
be
collecting
her
energies
for
a
terrible
explosion
,
"
in
the
hope
that
they
may
prove
acceptable
.
<EOS>
Here
's
a
nosegay
for
you
,
my
love
,
"
she
continued
,
opening
her
basket
,
and
presenting
a
fragrant
bunch
of
flowers
to
Winifred
,
"
if
your
mother
will
allow
me
to
give
it
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
touch
it
,
Winny
!
"
<EOS>
screamed
Mrs.
Wood
,
"
it
may
be
poisoned
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
afraid
,
mother
,
"
said
the
little
girl
,
smelling
at
the
bouquet
.
<EOS>
"
How
sweet
these
roses
are
!
<EOS>
Shall
I
put
them
into
water
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Put
them
where
they
came
from
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Wood
,
severely
,
"
and
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
,
mother
,
may
n't
I
sit
up
to
see
whether
Thames
returns
?
"
<EOS>
implored
Winifred
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
can
it
matter
to
you
whether
he
returns
or
not
,
child
,
"
rejoined
Mrs.
Wood
,
sharply
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
spoken
.
<EOS>
And
my
word
's
law
--
with
_
<EOS>
you
_
,
at
least
,
"
she
added
,
bestowing
a
cutting
glance
upon
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
girl
uttered
no
remonstrance
;
but
,
replacing
the
flowers
in
the
basket
,
burst
into
tears
,
and
withdrew
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
who
witnessed
this
occurrence
with
dismay
,
looked
timorously
at
Wood
,
in
expectation
of
some
hint
being
given
as
to
the
course
she
had
better
pursue
;
but
,
receiving
none
,
for
the
carpenter
was
too
much
agitated
to
attend
to
her
,
she
ventured
to
express
a
fear
that
she
was
intruding
.
 
<EOS>
"
Intruding
!
"
echoed
Mrs.
Wood
;
"
to
be
sure
you
are
!
<EOS>
I
wonder
how
you
dare
show
your
face
in
this
house
,
hussy
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
sent
for
me
,
Ma'am
,
"
replied
the
widow
,
humbly
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
I
did
,
"
retorted
Mrs.
Wood
;
"
and
I
did
so
to
see
how
far
your
effrontery
would
carry
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
I
'm
very
sorry
.
<EOS>
I
hope
I
have
n't
given
any
unintentional
offence
?
"
said
the
widow
,
again
meekly
appealing
to
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
exchange
glances
with
him
under
my
very
nose
,
woman
!
"
shrieked
Mrs.
Wood
;
"
I
'll
not
bear
it
.
<EOS>
Look
at
me
,
and
answer
me
one
question
.
<EOS>
And
,
mind
!
<EOS>
no
prevaricating
--
<EOS>
nothing
but
the
truth
will
satisfy
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Sheppard
raised
her
eyes
,
and
fixed
them
upon
her
interrogator
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
not
that
man
's
mistress
?
"
demanded
Mrs.
Wood
,
with
a
look
meant
to
reduce
her
supposed
rival
to
the
dust
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
no
man
's
mistress
,
"
answered
the
widow
,
crimsoning
to
her
temples
,
but
preserving
her
meek
deportment
,
and
humble
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
false
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs.
Wood
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
too
well
acquainted
with
your
proceedings
,
Madam
,
to
believe
that
.
<EOS>
Profligate
women
are
never
reclaimed
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
He
_
has
told
me
sufficient
of
you--
"
 
"
My
dear
,
"
interposed
Wood
,
"
for
goodness
'
sake--
"
 
"
I
_
will
_
speak
,
"
screamed
his
wife
,
totally
disregarding
the
interruption
;
"
I
_
will
_
tell
this
worthless
creature
what
I
know
about
her,--and
what
I
think
of
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
now
,
my
love
--
not
now
,
"
entreated
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
_
now
_
,
"
rejoined
the
infuriated
dame
;
"
perhaps
,
I
may
never
have
another
opportunity
.
<EOS>
She
has
contrived
to
keep
out
of
my
sight
up
to
this
time
,
and
I
've
no
doubt
she
'll
keep
out
of
it
altogether
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
was
my
doing
,
dearest
,
"
urged
the
carpenter
;
"
I
was
afraid
if
you
saw
her
that
some
such
scene
as
this
might
occur
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hear
me
,
Madam
,
I
beseech
you
,
"
interposed
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
"
and
,
if
it
please
you
to
visit
your
indignation
on
any
one
let
it
be
upon
me
,
and
not
on
your
excellent
husband
,
whose
only
fault
is
in
having
bestowed
his
charity
upon
so
unworthy
an
object
as
myself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Unworthy
,
indeed
!
"
sneered
Mrs.
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
him
I
owe
everything
,
"
continued
the
widow
,
"
life
itself
--
nay
,
more
than
life,--for
<EOS>
without
his
assistance
I
should
have
perished
,
body
and
soul
.
<EOS>
He
has
been
a
father
to
me
and
my
child
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
doubted
the
latter
point
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
,
Madam
,
"
observed
Mrs.
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
said
,
"
pursued
the
widow
,
"
that
she
,
who
has
once
erred
,
is
irreclaimable
.
<EOS>
Do
not
believe
it
,
Madam
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
so
.
<EOS>
The
poor
wretch
,
driven
by
desperation
to
the
commission
of
a
crime
which
her
soul
abhors
,
is
no
more
beyond
the
hope
of
reformation
than
she
is
without
the
pale
of
mercy
.
<EOS>
I
have
suffered
--
I
have
sinned
--
I
have
repented
.
<EOS>
And
,
though
neither
peace
nor
innocence
can
be
restored
to
my
bosom
;
though
tears
can
not
blot
out
my
offences
,
nor
sorrow
drown
my
shame
;
yet
,
knowing
that
my
penitence
is
sincere
,
I
do
not
despair
that
my
transgressions
may
be
forgiven
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mighty
fine
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Mrs.
Wood
,
contemptuously
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
understand
me
,
Madam
;
and
it
is
well
you
can
not
.
<EOS>
Blest
with
a
fond
husband
,
surrounded
by
every
comfort
,
_
you
_
have
never
been
assailed
by
the
horrible
temptations
to
which
misery
has
exposed
_
me
_
.
<EOS>
You
have
never
known
what
it
is
to
want
food
,
raiment
,
shelter
.
<EOS>
You
have
never
seen
the
child
within
your
arms
perishing
from
hunger
,
and
no
relief
to
be
obtained
.
<EOS>
You
have
never
felt
the
hearts
of
all
hardened
against
you
;
have
never
heard
the
jeer
or
curse
from
every
lip
;
nor
endured
the
insult
and
the
blow
from
every
hand
.
<EOS>
I
_
have
_
suffered
all
this
.
<EOS>
I
could
resist
the
tempter
_
<EOS>
now
_
,
I
am
strong
in
health,--in
mind
.
<EOS>
But
_
then_--Oh
!
<EOS>
Madam
,
there
are
moments
--
moments
of
darkness
,
which
overshadow
a
whole
existence
--
in
the
lives
of
the
poor
houseless
wretches
who
traverse
the
streets
,
when
reason
is
<EOS>
well
-
nigh
benighted
;
when
the
horrible
promptings
of
despair
can
,
alone
,
be
listened
to
;
and
when
vice
itself
assumes
the
aspect
of
virtue
.
<EOS>
Pardon
what
I
have
said
,
Madam
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
desire
to
extenuate
my
guilt
--
far
less
to
defend
it
;
but
I
would
show
you
,
and
such
as
you
--
who
,
happily
,
are
exempted
from
trials
like
mine
--
how
much
misery
has
to
do
with
crime
.
<EOS>
And
I
affirm
to
you
,
on
my
own
conviction
,
that
she
who
falls
,
because
she
has
not
strength
granted
her
to
struggle
with
affliction
<EOS>
,
_
may
_
be
reclaimed,--may
repent
,
and
be
forgiven,--even
as
she
,
whose
sins
,
'
though
many
,
were
forgiven
her
'
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
gladdens
me
to
hear
you
talk
thus
,
Joan
,
"
said
Wood
,
in
a
voice
of
much
emotion
,
while
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
,
"
and
more
than
repays
me
for
all
I
have
done
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
professions
of
repentance
constitute
a
Magdalene
,
Mrs.
Sheppard
is
one
,
no
doubt
,
"
observed
Mrs.
Wood
,
ironically
;
"
but
I
used
to
think
it
required
something
more
than
_
mere
words
_
to
prove
that
a
person
's
character
was
abused
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Very
right
,
my
love
,
"
said
Wood
,
"
very
sensibly
remarked
.
<EOS>
So
it
does
.
<EOS>
Bu
<EOS>
I
can
speak
to
that
point
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Sheppard
's
conduct
,
from
my
own
personal
knowledge
,
has
been
unexceptionable
for
the
last
twelve
years
.
<EOS>
During
that
period
she
has
been
a
model
of
propriety
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
of
course
,
"
rejoined
Mrs.
Wood
;
"
I
ca
n't
for
an
instant
question
such
distinterested
testimony
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
I
'm
sure
,
will
say
as
much
for
you
.
<EOS>
He
's
a
model
of
conjugal
attachment
and
fidelity
,
a
pattern
to
his
family
,
and
an
example
to
his
neighbours
.
<EOS>
Ai
n't
he
,
Madam
?
'
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
,
indeed
,
"
replied
the
widow
,
fervently
;
"
more
--
much
more
than
that
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
no
such
thing
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs.
Wood
,
furiously
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
a
base
,
deceitful
,
tyrannical
,
hoary
-
headed
libertine
--
<EOS>
that
's
what
he
is
.
<EOS>
But
,
I
'll
expose
him
.
<EOS>
I
'll
proclaim
his
misdoings
to
the
world
;
and
,
then
,
we
shall
see
where
he
'll
stand
.
<EOS>
Marry
,
come
up
!
<EOS>
I
'll
show
him
what
an
injured
wife
can
do
.
<EOS>
If
all
wives
were
of
my
mind
and
my
spirit
,
husbands
would
soon
be
taught
their
own
insignificance
.
<EOS>
But
a
time
_
will
_
come
(
and
that
before
long
,
)
when
our
sex
will
assert
its
superiority
;
and
,
when
we
have
got
the
upper
hand
,
let
'em
try
to
subdue
us
if
they
can
.
<EOS>
But
do
n't
suppose
,
Madam
,
that
anything
I
say
has
reference
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
'm
speaking
of
virtuous
women
--
of
WIVES
,
Madam
.
<EOS>
Mistresses
neither
deserve
consideration
nor
commiseration
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
expect
no
commiseration
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
gently
,
"
nor
do
I
need
any
.
<EOS>
But
,
rather
than
be
the
cause
of
any
further
misunderstanding
between
you
and
my
benefactor
,
I
will
leave
London
and
its
neighbourhood
for
ever
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
so
,
Madam
,
"
retorted
Mrs.
Wood
,
"
and
take
your
son
with
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
son
!
"
echoed
the
widow
,
trembling
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
your
son
,
Madam
.
<EOS>
If
you
can
do
any
good
with
him
,
it
's
more
than
we
can
.
<EOS>
The
house
will
be
well
rid
of
him
,
for
a
more
idle
,
good
-
for
-
nothing
reprobate
never
crossed
its
threshold
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Is
this
true
,
Sir
?
"
cried
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
with
an
agonized
look
at
Wood
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
'll
not
deceive
me
.
<EOS>
Is
Jack
what
Mrs.
Wood
represents
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
not
exactly
what
I
could
desire
him
to
be
,
Joan
,
"
replied
the
carpenter
,
reluctantly
,
"
But
a
ragged
colt
sometimes
makes
the
best
horse
.
<EOS>
He
'll
mend
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
,
"
said
Mrs.
Wood,--"he'll
never
mend
.
<EOS>
He
has
taken
more
than
one
step
towards
the
gallows
already
.
<EOS>
Thieves
and
pickpockets
are
his
constant
companions
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Thieves
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
horror
-
stricken
.
 
<EOS>
"
Jonathan
Wild
and
Blueskin
have
got
him
into
their
hands
,
"
continued
Mrs.
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
"
Impossible
!
"
exclaimed
the
widow
,
wildly
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
doubt
my
word
,
woman
,
"
replied
the
carpenter
's
wife
,
coldly
,
"
ask
Mr.
Wood
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
'll
contradict
it
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
widow
,
looking
at
Wood
as
if
she
dreaded
to
have
her
fears
<EOS>
confirmed,--"I
<EOS>
know
you
will
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
,
Joan
,
"
returned
the
carpenter
,
sadly
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Sheppard
let
fall
her
basket
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
son
,
"
she
murmured
,
wringing
her
hands
piteously--
,
"
my
son
the
companion
of
thieves
!
<EOS>
My
son
in
Jonathan
Wild
's
power
!
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
rejoined
Mrs.
Wood
,
in
a
taunting
tone
.
"
<EOS>
Your
son
's
father
was
a
thief
;
and
Jonathan
Wild
(
unless
I
'm
misinformed
,
)
was
his
friend,--so
<EOS>
it
's
not
unnatural
he
should
show
some
partiality
towards
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Jonathan
Wild
was
my
husband
's
bitterest
enemy
,
"
said
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
He
first
seduced
him
from
the
paths
of
honesty
,
and
then
betrayed
him
to
a
shameful
death
,
and
he
has
sworn
to
do
the
same
thing
by
my
son
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Heavens
;
that
I
should
have
ever
indulged
a
hope
of
happiness
while
that
terrible
man
lives
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Compose
yourself
,
Joan
,
"
said
Wood
;
"
all
will
yet
be
well
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no,--no
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
distractedly
.
<EOS>
"
All
can
not
be
well
,
if
this
is
true
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
Sir
,
"
she
added
,
with
forced
calmness
,
and
grasping
Wood
's
arm
;
"
what
has
Jack
done
?
<EOS>
Tell
me
in
a
word
,
that
I
may
know
the
worst
.
<EOS>
I
can
bear
anything
but
suspense
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
agitating
yourself
unnecessarily
,
Joan
,
"
returned
Wood
,
in
a
soothing
voice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Jack
has
been
keeping
bad
company
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
only
fault
I
know
of
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Thank
God
for
that
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
fervently
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
it
is
not
too
late
to
save
him
.
<EOS>
Where
is
he
,
Sir
?
<EOS>
Can
I
see
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
that
you
ca
n't
,
"
answered
Mrs.
Wood
;
"
he
has
gone
out
without
leave
,
and
has
taken
Thames
Darrell
with
him
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
Mr.
Wood
,
when
he
does
return
,
I
'd
send
him
about
his
business

<EOS>
I
would
n't
keep
an
apprentice
to
set
my
authority
at
defiance
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Wood
's
reply
,
if
he
intended
any
,
was
cut
short
by
a
loud
knocking
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Odd's
-
<EOS>
my
-
life!--what
's
that
?
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
greatly
alarmed
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
<EOS>
Jonathan
Wild
come
back
with
a
troop
of
constables
at
his
heels
,
to
search
the
house
,
"
rejoined
Mrs.
Wood
,
in
equal
trepidation

<EOS>
"
We
shall
all
be
murdered
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
that
Mr.
Kneebone
were
here
to
protect
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
it
_
is
_
Jonathan
,
"
rejoined
Wood
,
"
it
is
very
well
for
Mr.
Kneebone
<EOS>
he
's
not
here
.
<EOS>
He
'd
have
enough
to
do
to
protect
himself
,
without
attending
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
declare
I
'm
almost
afraid
to
go
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
Something
,
I
'm
convinced
,
has
happened
to
the
boys
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Has
Jonathan
Wild
been
here
to
-
day
?
"
asked
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
anxiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
he
has
!
"
returned
Mrs.
Wood
;
"
and
Blueskin
,
too
.
<EOS>
They
're
only
just
gone
,
mercy
on
us
!
<EOS>
what
a
clatter
,
"
she
added
,
as
the
knocking
was
repeated
more
violently
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
While
the
carpenter
irresolutely
quitted
the
room
,
with
a
strong
presentiment
of
ill
upon
his
mind
,
a
light
quick
step
was
heard
descending
the
stairs
,
and
before
he
could
call
out
to
prevent
it
,
a
man
was
admitted
into
the
passage
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
this
Misther
Wudd
's
,
my
pretty
miss
?
"
<EOS>
demanded
the
rough
voice
of
the
Irish
watchman
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
"
,
seplied
Winifred
;
"
have
you
brought
any
tidings
of
Thames
Darrell
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Troth
have
I
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Terence
:
"
but
,
bless
your
angilic
face
,
how
did
you
contrive
to
guess
that
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Is
he
<EOS>
well?--is
<EOS>
he
<EOS>
safe?--is
<EOS>
he
coming
back
,
"
cried
the
little
girl
,
disregarding
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
in
St.
Giles
's
round
-
house
,
"
answered
Terence
;
"
but
tell
Mr.
Wudd
I
'm
here
,
and
have
brought
him
a
message
from
his
unlawful
son
,
and
do
n't
be
detainin

<EOS>
me
,
my
darlin

,
for
there
's
not
a
minute
to
lose
if
the
poor
lad
's
to
be
recused
from
the
clutches
of
that
thief
and
thief
-
taker
<EOS>
o

<EOS>
the

Jonathan
Wild
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
carpenter
,
upon
whom
no
part
of
this
hurried
dialogue
had
been
lost
,
now
made
his
appearance
,
and
having
obtained
from
Terence
all
the
information
which
that
personage
could
impart
respecting
the
perilous
situation
of
Thames
,
he
declared
himself
ready
to
start
to
Saint
Giles
's
at
once
,
and
ran
back
to
the
room
for
his
hat
and
stick
;
expressing
his
firm
determination
,
as
he
pocketed
his
constable
's
staff
with
which
he
thought
it
expedient
to
arm
himself
,
of
being
direfully
revenged
upon
the
thief
-
taker
:
<EOS>
a
determination
in
which
he
was
strongly
encouraged
by
his
wife
.
<EOS>
Terence
,
meanwhile
,
who
had
followed
him
,
did
not
remain
silent
,
but
recapitulated
his
story
,
for
the
benefit
of
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
The
poor
widow
was
thrown
into
an
agony
of
distress
on
learning
that
a
robbery
had
been
committed
,
in
which
her
son
(
for
she
could
not
doubt
that
Jack
was
one
of
the
boys
,
)
was
implicated
;
nor
was
her
anxiety
alleviated
by
Mrs.
Wood
,
who
maintained
stoutly
,
that
if
Thames
had
been
led
to
do
wrong
,
it
must
be
through
the
instrumentality
of
his
worthless
companion
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
there
you
're
right
<EOS>
,
you
may
dipind
,
marm
,
"
observed
Terence
.
"
<EOS>
Master
Thames
Ditt
<EOS>
--
what
's
his
blessed
name?--has
honesty
written
in
his
handsome
phiz
;
but
as
to
his
companion
,
Jack
Sheppard
,
I
think
you
call
him
,
he
's
a
born
and
bred
thief
.
<EOS>
Lord
bless
you
marm
!
<EOS>
we
sees
plenty
on
'em
in
our
purfession
.
<EOS>
Them
young
prigs
is
all
alike
.
<EOS>
I
seed
he
was
one,--and
<EOS>
a
sharp
un
,
too,--at
a
glance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
exclaimed
the
widow
,
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
a
drop
of
brandy
before
we
start
,
watchman
,
"
said
Wood
,
pouring
out
a
glass
of
spirit
,
and
presenting
it
to
Terence
,
who
smacked
his
lips
as
he
disposed
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
you
be
persuaded
,
Joan
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
making
a
similar
offer
to
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
which
she
gratefully
declined
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
mean
to
accompany
us
,
you
may
need
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
kind
,
Sir
,
"
returned
the
widow
,
"
but
I
require
no
support
.
<EOS>
Nothing
stronger
than
water
has
passed
my
lips
for
years
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
may
believe
as
much
of
that
as
we
please
,
I
suppose
,
"
observed
the
carpenter
's
wife
,
with
a
sneer
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Wood
,
"
she
continued
,
in
an
authoritative
tone
,
seeing
her
husband
ready
to
depart
,
"
one
word
before
you
set
out
.
<EOS>
If
Jack
Sheppard
or
his
mother
ever
enter
this
house
again
,
I
leave
it
--
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
Now
,
do
what
you
please
.
<EOS>
You
know
_
my
_
fixed
determination
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Wood
made
no
reply
;
but
,
hastily
kissing
his
weeping
daughter
,
and
bidding
her
be
of
good
cheer
,
hurried
off
.
<EOS>
He
was
followed
with
equal
celerity
by
Terence
and
the
widow
.
<EOS>
Traversing
what
remained
of
Wych
Street
at
a
rapid
pace
,
and
speeding
along
Drury
Lane
,
the
trio
soon
found
themselves
in
Kendrick
Yard
.
<EOS>
When
they
came
to
the
round
-
house
,
Terry
's
courage
failed
him
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
terror
inspired
by
Wild
's
vindictive
character
,
that
few
durst
face
him
who
had
given
him
cause
for
displeasure
.
<EOS>
Aware
that
he
should
incur
the
thief
-
taker
's
bitterest
animosity
by
what
he
had
done
,
the
watchman
,
whose
wrath
against
Quilt
Arnold
had
evaporated
during
the
walk
,
thought
it
more
prudent
not
to
hazard
a
meeting
with
his
master
,
till
the
storm
had
,
in
some
measure
,
blown
over
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
having
given
Wood
such
directions
as
he
thought
necessary
for
his
guidance
,
and
received
a
handsome
gratuity
in
return
for
his
services
,
he
departed
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
without
considerable
demur
and
delay
on
the
part
of
Sharples
that
the
carpenter
and
his
companion
could
gain
admittance
to
the
round
-
house
.
<EOS>
Reconnoitring
them
through
a
small
grated
loophole
,
he
refused
to
open
the
door
till
they
had
explained
their
business
.
<EOS>
This
,
Wood
,
acting
upon
Terry
's
caution
,
was
most
unwilling
to
do
;
but
,
finding
he
had
no
alternative
,
he
reluctantly
made
known
his
errand
and
the
bolts
were
undrawn
.
<EOS>
Once
in
,
the
constable
's
manner
appeared
totally
changed
.
<EOS>
He
was
now
as
civil
as
he
had
just
been
insolent
.
<EOS>
Apologizing
for
their
detention
,
he
answered
the
questions
put
to
him
respecting
the
boys
,
by
positively
denying
that
any
such
prisoners
had
been
entrusted
to
his
charge
,
but
offered
to
conduct
him
to
every
cell
in
the
building
to
prove
the
truth
of
his
assertion
.
<EOS>
He
then
barred
and
double
-
locked
the
door
,
took
out
the
key
,
(
a
precautionary
measure
which
,
with
a
grim
smile
,
he
said
he
never
omitted
,
)
thrust
it
into
his
vest
,
and
motioning
the
couple
to
follow
him
,
led
the
way
to
the
inner
room
.
<EOS>
As
Wood
obeyed
,
his
foot
slipped
;
and
,
casting
his
eyes
upon
the
floor
,
he
perceived
it
splashed
in
several
places
with
blood
.
<EOS>
From
the
freshness
of
the
stains
,
which
grew
more
frequent
as
they
approached
the
adjoining
chamber
,
it
was
evident
some
violence
had
been
recently
perpetrated
,
and
the
carpenter
's
own
blood
froze
within
his
veins
as
he
thought
,
with
a
thrill
of
horror
,
that
,
perhaps
on
this
very
spot
,
not
many
minutes
before
his
arrival
,
his
adopted
son
might
have
been
inhumanly
butchered
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
this
impression
removed
as
he
stole
a
glance
at
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
and
saw
from
her
terrified
look
that
she
had
made
the
same
alarming
discovery
as
himself
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
now
too
late
to
turn
back
,
and
,
nerving
himself
for
the
shock
he
expected
to
encounter
,
he
ventured
after
his
conductor
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
had
they
entered
the
room
than
Sharples
,
who
waited
to
usher
them
in
,
hastily
retreated
,
closed
the
door
,
and
turning
the
key
,
laughed
loudly
at
the
success
of
his
stratagem
.
<EOS>
Vexation
at
his
folly
in
suffering
himself
to
be
thus
entrapped
kept
Wood
for
a
short
time
silent
.
<EOS>
When
he
could
find
words
,
he
tried
by
the
most
urgent
solicitations
to
prevail
upon
the
constable
to
let
him
out
.
<EOS>
But
threats
and
entreaties
--
even
promises
were
ineffectual
;
and
the
unlucky
captive
,
after
exhausting
his
powers
of
persuasion
,
was
compelled
to
give
up
the
point
.
 
<EOS>
The
room
in
which
he
was
detained
--
that
lately
occupied
by
the
Mohocks
,
who
,
it
appeared
,
had
been
allowed
to
depart,--was
calculated
to
inspire
additional
apprehension
and
disgust
.
<EOS>
Strongly
impregnated
with
the
mingled
odours
of
tobacco
,
ale
,
brandy
,
and
other
liquors
,
the
atmosphere
was
almost
stifling
.
<EOS>
The
benches
running
round
the
room
,
though
fastened
to
the
walls
by
iron
clamps
,
had
been
forcibly
wrenched
off
;
while
the
table
,
which
was
similarly
secured
to
the
boards
,
was
upset
,
and
its
contents
--
bottles
,
jugs
,
glasses
,
and
bowls
were
broken
and
scattered
about
in
all
directions
.
<EOS>
Everything
proclaimed
the
mischievous
propensities
of
the
recent
occupants
of
the
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
Here
lay
a
heap
of
knockers
of
all
sizes
,
from
the
huge
lion
's
head
to
the
small
brass
rapper
:
there
,
a
collection
of
sign
-
boards
,
with
the
names
and
calling
of
the
owners
utterly
obliterated
.
<EOS>
On
this
side
stood
the
instruments
with
which
the
latter
piece
of
pleasantry
had
been
effected,--namely
,
a
bucket
filled
with
paint
and
a
brush
:
on
that
was
erected
a
trophy
,
consisting
of
a
watchman
's
rattle
,
a
laced
hat
,
with
the
crown
knocked
out
,
and
its
place
supplied
by
a
lantern
,
a
campaign
wig
saturated
with
punch
,
a
torn
steen
-
kirk
and
ruffles
,
some
half
-
dozen
staves
,
and
a
broken
sword
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
carpenter
's
gaze
wandered
over
this
scene
of
devastation
,
his
attention
was
drawn
by
Mrs.
Sheppard
towards
an
appalling
object
in
one
corner
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
body
of
a
man
,
apparently
lifeless
,
and
stretched
upon
a
mattress
,
with
his
head
bound
up
in
a
linen
cloth
,
through
which
the
blood
had
oosed
.
<EOS>
Near
the
body
,
which
,
it
will
be
surmised
,
was
that
of
Abraham
Mendez
,
two
ruffianly
personages
were
seated
,
quietly
smoking
,
and
bestowing
no
sort
of
attention
upon
the
new
-
comers
.
<EOS>
Their
conversation
was
conducted
in
the
flash
language
,
and
,
though
unintelligible
to
Wood
,
was
easily
comprehended
by
this
companion
,
who
learnt
,
to
her
dismay
,
that
the
wounded
man
had
received
his
hurt
from
her
son
,
whose
courage
and
dexterity
formed
the
present
subject
of
their
discourse
.
<EOS>
From
other
obscure
hints
dropped
by
the
speakers
,
Mrs.
Sheppard
ascertained
that
Thames
Darrell
had
been
carried
off
--
where
she
could
not
make
out
--
by
Jonathan
Wild
and
Quilt
Arnold
;
and
that
Jack
had
been
induced
to
accompany
Blueskin
to
the
Mint
.
<EOS>
This
intelligence
,
which
she
instantly
communicated
to
the
carpenter
,
drove
him
almost
frantic
.
<EOS>
He
renewed
his
supplications
to
Sharples
,
but
with
no
better
success
than
heretofore
;
and
the
greater
part
of
the
night
was
passed
by
him
and
the
poor
widow
,
whose
anxiety
,
if
possible
,
exceeded
his
own
,
in
the
most
miserable
state
imaginable
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
about
three
o'clock
,
as
the
first
glimmer
of
dawn
became
visible
through
the
barred
casements
of
the
round
-
house
,
the
rattling
of
bolts
and
chains
at
the
outer
door
told
that
some
one
was
admitted
.
<EOS>
Whoever
this
might
be
,
the
visit
seemed
to
have
some
reference
to
the
carpenter
,
for
,
<EOS>
shortly
afterwards
,
Sharples
made
his
appearance
,
and
informed
the
captives
they
were
free
.
<EOS>
Without
waiting
to
have
the
information
repeated
,
Wood
rushed
forth
,
determined
as
soon
as
he
could
procure
assistance
,
to
proceed
to
Jonathan
Wild
's
house
in
the
Old
Bailey
;
while
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
whose
maternal
fears
drew
her
in
another
direction
,
hurried
off
to
the
Mint
.

CHAPTER
XIV
.
 
<EOS>
The
Flash
Ken
.
  
<EOS>
In
an
incredibly
short
space
of
time,--for
her
anxiety
lent
wings
to
her
feet,--Mrs
.
<EOS>
Sheppard
reached
the
debtor
's
garrison
.
<EOS>
From
a
scout
stationed
at
the
northern
entrance
,
whom
she
addressed
in
the
jargon
of
the
place
,
with
which
long
usage
had
formerly
rendered
her
familiar
,
she
ascertained
that
Blueskin
,
accompanied
by
a
youth
,
whom
she
knew
by
the
description
must
be
her
son
,
had
arrived
there
about
three
hours
before
,
and
had
proceeded
to
the
Cross
Shovels
.
<EOS>
This
was
enough
for
the
poor
widow
.
<EOS>
She
felt
she
was
now
near
her
boy
,
and
,
nothing
doubting
her
ability
to
rescue
him
from
his
perilous
situation
,
she
breathed
a
fervent
prayer
for
his
deliverance
;
and
bending
her
steps
towards
the
tavern
in
question
,
revolved
within
her
mind
as
she
walked
along
the
best
means
of
accomplishing
her
purpose
.
<EOS>
Aware
of
the
cunning
and
desperate
characters
of
the
persons
with
whom
she
would
have
to
deal,--aware
,
also
,
that
she
was
in
a
quarter
where
no
laws
could
be
appealed
to
,
nor
assistance
obtained
<EOS>
,
she
felt
the
absolute
necessity
of
caution
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
when
she
arrived
at
the
Shovels
,
with
which
,
as
an
old
haunt
in
her
bygone
days
of
wretchedness
she
was
well
acquainted
,
instead
of
entering
the
principal
apartment
,
which
she
saw
at
a
glance
was
crowded
with
company
of
both
sexes
,
she
turned
into
a
small
room
on
the
left
of
the
bar
,
and
,
as
an
excuse
for
so
doing
,
called
for
something
to
drink
.
<EOS>
The
drawers
at
the
moment
were
too
busy
to
attend
to
her
,
and
she
would
have
seized
the
opportunity
of
examining
,
unperceived
,
the
assemblage
within
,
through
a
little
curtained
window
that
overlooked
the
adjoining
chamber
,
if
an
impediment
had
not
existed
in
the
shape
of
Baptist
Kettleby
,
whose
portly
person
entirely
obscured
the
view
.
<EOS>
The
Master
of
the
Mint
,
in
the
exercise
of
his
two
-
fold
office
of
governor
and
publican
,
was
mounted
upon
a
chair
,
and
holding
forth
to
his
guests
in
a
speech
,
to
which
Mrs.
Sheppard
was
unwillingly
compelled
to
listen
.
 
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
of
the
Mint
,
"
said
the
orator
,
"
when
I
was
first
called
,
some
fifty
years
ago
,
to
the
important
office
I
hold
,
there
existed
across
the
water
three
places
of
refuge
for
the
oppressed
and
persecuted
debtor
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
know
it
,
"
cried
several
voices
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
happened
,
gentlemen
,
"
pursued
the
Master
,
"
on
a
particular
occasion
,
about
the
time
I
've
mentioned
,
that
the
Archduke
of
Alsatia
,
the
Sovereign
of
the
Savoy
,
and
the
Satrap
of
Salisbury
Court
,
met
by
accident
at
the
Cross
Shovels
.
<EOS>
A
jolly
night
we
made
of
it
,
as
you
may
suppose
;
for
four
such
monarchs
do
n't
often
come
together
.
<EOS>
Well
,
while
we
were
smoking
our
pipes
,
and
quaffing
our
punch
,
Alsatia
turns
to
me
and
says
,
'
Mint
,
'
says
he
,
'
you
're
well
off
here
.
<EOS>
'--'Pretty
<EOS>
well
,
'
says
I
;
'
you
're
not
badly
off
at
the
Friars
,
for
that
matter
.
<EOS>
'--'Oh
!
<EOS>
yes
we
are
,
'
says
he.--'How
so
?
'
<EOS>
says
<EOS>
I.--'It
's
all
up
with
us
,
'
says
he
;
'
they
've
taken
away
our
charter
.
<EOS>
'--'They
ca
n't
,
'
says
I.--'They
have
,
'
says
he.--'They
ca
n't
<EOS>
,
I
tell
you
,
'
says
I
,
in
a
bit
of
a
passion
;
'
it
's
unconstitutional
.
<EOS>
'--'Unconstitutional
<EOS>
or
not
,
'
says
Salisbury
Court
and
Savoy
,
speaking
together
,
'
it
's
true
.
<EOS>
We
shall
become
a
prey
to
the
Philistines
,
and
must
turn
honest
in
self
-
defence
.
<EOS>
'--'No
fear
o
'
that
,
'
thought
I.--'I
see
how
it
'll
be
,
'
observed
Alsatia
,
'
everybody'll
pay
his
debts
,
and
only
think
of
such
a
state
of
things
as
that
.
<EOS>
'--'It
's
_
not
_
to
be
thought
of
,
'
says
I
,
thumping
the
table
till
every
glass
on
it
jingled
;
'
and
I
know
a
way
as'll
prevent
it
.
<EOS>
'--'What
is
it
,
Mint
?
'
<EOS>
asked
all
three.--'Why
,
hang
every
bailiff
that
sets
a
foot
in
your
territories
,
and
you
're
safe
,
'
says
I.--'We'll
do
it
,
'
said
they
,
filling
their
glasses
,
and
looking
as
fierce
as
King
George
's
grenadier
guards
;
'
here
's
your
health
,
Mint
.
'
<EOS>
But
,
gentlemen
,
though
they
talked
so
largely
,
and
looked
so
fiercely
,
they
did
_
not
_
do
it
;
they
did
_
not
_
hang
the
bailiffs
;
and
where
are
they
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
where
are
they
?
"
echoed
the
company
with
indignant
derision
.
 
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
"
returned
the
Master
,
solemnly
,
"
it
is
a
question
easily
answered
--
they
are
NOWHERE
!
<EOS>
Had
they
hanged
the
bailiffs
,
the
bailiffs
would
not
have
hanged
them
.
<EOS>
We
ourselves
have
been
similarly
circumstanced
.
<EOS>
Attacked
by
an
infamous
and
unconstitutional
statute
,
passed
in
the
reign
of
the
late
usurper
,
William
of
Orange
,
(
for
I
may
remark
that
,
if
the
right
king
had
been
upon
the
throne
,
that
illegal
enactment
would
never
have
received
the
royal
assent
--
the
Stuarts
--
<EOS>
Heaven
preserve
'
em!--always
siding
with
the
debtors
)
;
attacked
in
this
outrageous
manner
<EOS>
,
I
repeat
,
it
has
been
all
but
'
_
up
_
'
with
US
!
<EOS>
But
the
vigorous
resistance
offered
on
that
memorable
occasion
by
the
patriotic
inhabitants
of
Bermuda
to
the
aggressions
of
arbitrary
power
,
secured
and
established
their
privileges
on
a
firmer
basis
than
heretofore
;
and
,
while
their
pusillanimous
allies
were
crushed
and
annihilated
,
they
became
more
prosperous
than
ever
.
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
I
am
proud
to
say
that
_
<EOS>
I
_
originated
--
that
_
I
_
directed
those
measures
.
<EOS>
I
hope
to
see
the
day
,
when
not
Southwark
alone
,
but
London
itself
shall
become
one
Mint,--when
all
men
shall
be
debtors
,
and
none
creditors,--when
imprisonment
for
debt
shall
be
utterly
abolished,--when
highway
-
robbery
shall
be
accounted
a
pleasant
pastime
,
and
<EOS>
forgery
an
accomplishment,--when
Tyburn
and
its
gibbets
shall
be
overthrown,--capital
punishments
discontinued,--Newgate
,
Ludgate
,
the
Gatehouse
,
and
the
Compters
<EOS>
razed
to
the
ground,--Bridewell
and
Clerkenwell
destroyed,--the
Fleet
,
the
King
's
Bench
,
and
the
Marshalsea
remembered
only
by
name
!
<EOS>
But
,
in
the
mean
time
,
as
that
day
may
possibly
be
farther
off
than
I
anticipate
,
we
are
bound
to
make
the
most
of
the
present
.
<EOS>
Take
care
of
yourselves
,
gentlemen
,
and
your
governor
will
take
care
of
you
.
<EOS>
Before
I
sit
down
,
I
have
a
toast
to
propose
,
which
I
am
sure
will
be
received
,
as
it
deserves
to
be
,
with
enthusiasm
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
health
of
a
stranger,--of
Mr.
John
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
His
father
was
one
of
my
old
customers
,
and
I
am
happy
to
find
his
son
treading
in
his
steps
.
<EOS>
He
could
n't
be
in
better
hands
than
those
in
which
he
has
placed
himself
.
<EOS>
Gentlemen,--Mr
.
<EOS>
Sheppard
's
good
health
,
and
success
to
him
!
"
 
<EOS>
Baptist
's
toast
was
received
with
loud
applause
,
and
,
as
he
sat
down
amid
the
cheers
of
the
company
,
and
a
universal
clatter
of
mugs
and
glasses
,
the
widow
's
view
was
no
longer
obstructed
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
wandered
quickly
over
that
riotous
and
disorderly
assemblage
,
until
it
settled
upon
one
group
more
riotous
and
disorderly
than
the
rest
,
of
which
her
son
formed
the
principal
figure
.
<EOS>
The
agonized
mother
could
scarcely
repress
a
scream
at
the
spectacle
that
met
her
gaze
.
<EOS>
There
sat
Jack
,
evidently
in
the
last
stage
of
intoxication
,
with
his
collar
opened
,
his
dress
disarranged
,
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
,
a
bowl
of
punch
and
a
half
-
emptied
rummer
before
him,--there
<EOS>
he
sat
,
receiving
and
returning
,
or
rather
attempting
to
return,--for
<EOS>
he
was
almost
past
consciousness,--the
blandishments
of
a
couple
of
females
,
one
of
whom
had
passed
her
arm
<EOS>
round
his
neck
,
while
the
other
leaned
over
the
back
of
his
chair
and
appeared
from
her
gestures
to
be
whispering
soft
nonsense
into
his
ear
.
 
<EOS>
Both
these
ladies
possessed
considerable
personal
attractions
.
<EOS>
The
younger
of
the
two
,
who
was
seated
next
to
Jack
,
and
seemed
to
monopolize
his
attention
,
could
not
be
more
than
seventeen
,
though
her
person
had
all
the
maturity
of
twenty
.
<EOS>
She
had
delicate
oval
features
,
light
,
laughing
blue
eyes
,
a
pretty
_
nez
retroussé
_
,
(
why
have
we
not
the
term
,
since
we
have
the
best
specimens
of
the
feature
?
)
<EOS>
teeth
of
pearly
whiteness
,
and
a
brilliant
complexion
,
set
off
by
rich
auburn
hair
,
a
very
white
neck
and
shoulders,--the
latter
,
perhaps
,
a
trifle
too
much
exposed
.
<EOS>
The
name
of
this
damsel
was
Edgeworth
Bess
;
and
,
as
her
fascinations
will
not
,
perhaps
,
be
found
to
be
without
some
influence
upon
the
future
fortunes
of
her
boyish
admirer
,
we
have
thought
it
worth
while
to
be
thus
particular
in
describing
them
.
<EOS>
The
other
_
bona
roba
_
,
known
amongst
her
companions
as
Mistress
Poll
Maggot
<EOS>
,
was
a
beauty
on
a
much
larger
scale,--in
fact
,
a
perfect
Amazon
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
though
nearly
six
feet
high
,
and
correspondingly
proportioned
,
she
was
a
model
of
symmetry
,
and
boasted
,
with
the
frame
of
a
Thalestris
or
a
Trulla
,
the
regular
lineaments
of
the
Medicean
Venus
.
<EOS>
A
man
's
laced
hat,--whether
adopted
from
the
caprice
of
the
moment
,
or
habitually
worn
,
we
are
unable
to
state,--cocked
knowingly
on
her
head
,
harmonized
with
her
masculine
appearance
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Maggot
,
as
well
as
her
companion
Edgeworth
Bess
,
was
showily
dressed
;
nor
did
either
of
them
disdain
the
aid
supposed
to
be
lent
to
a
fair
skin
by
the
contents
of
the
patchbox
.
<EOS>
On
an
empty
cask
,
which
served
him
for
a
chair
,
and
opposite
Jack
Sheppard
,
whose
rapid
progress
in
depravity
afforded
him
the
highest
satisfaction
,
sat
Blueskin
,
encouraging
the
two
women
in
their
odious
task
,
and
plying
his
victim
with
the
glass
as
often
as
he
deemed
it
expedient
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
he
had
apparently
accomplished
all
he
desired
;
for
moving
the
bottle
out
of
Jack
's
reach
,
he
appropriated
it
entirely
to
his
own
use
,
leaving
the
devoted
lad
to
the
care
of
the
females
.
<EOS>
Some
few
of
the
individuals
seated
at
the
other
tables
seemed
to
take
an
interest
in
the
proceedings
of
Blueskin
and
his
party
,
just
as
a
bystander
watches
any
other
game
;
but
,
generally
speaking
,
the
company
were
too
much
occupied
with
their
own
concerns
to
pay
attention
to
anything
else
.
<EOS>
The
assemblage
was
for
the
most
part
,
if
not
altogether
,
composed
of
persons
to
whom
vice
in
all
its
aspects
was
too
familiar
to
present
much
of
novelty
,
in
whatever
form
it
was
exhibited
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
Jack
by
any
means
the
only
stripling
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
Not
far
from
him
was
a
knot
of
lads
drinking
,
swearing
,
and
playing
at
dice
as
eagerly
and
as
skilfully
as
any
of
the
older
hands
.
<EOS>
Near
to
these
hopeful
youths
sat
a
fence
,
or
receiver
,
bargaining
with
a
clouter
,
or
pickpocket
,
for
a
_
suit_,--or
,
to
speak
in
more
intelligible
language
,
a
watch
and
seals
,
two
_
cloaks
_
,
commonly
called
watch
-
cases
,
and
a
_
wedge
-
lobb
,
_
otherwise
known
as
a
silver
snuff
-
box
.
<EOS>
Next
to
the
receiver
was
a
gang
of
housebreakers
,
laughing
over
their
exploits
,
and
planning
fresh
depredations
;
and
next
to
the
housebreakers
came
two
gallant
-
looking
gentlemen
in
long
periwigs
and
riding
-
dresses
,
and
equipped
in
all
other
respects
for
the
road
,
with
a
roast
fowl
and
a
bottle
of
wine
before
them
.
<EOS>
Amid
this
varied
throng,--varied
in
appearance
,
but
alike
in
character,--one
object
alone
,
we
have
said
,
rivetted
Mrs.
Sheppard
's
attention
;
and
no
sooner
did
she
in
some
degree
recover
from
the
shock
occasioned
by
the
sight
of
her
son
's
debased
condition
,
than
,
regardless
of
any
other
consideration
except
his
instant
removal
from
the
contaminating
society
by
which
he
was
surrounded
,
and
utterly
forgetting
the
more
cautious
plan
she
meant
to
have
adopted
,
she
rushed
into
the
room
,
and
summoned
him
to
follow
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Halloa
!
"
cried
Jack
,
looking
round
,
and
trying
to
fix
his
inebriate
gaze
upon
the
speaker,--"who
's
that
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
mother
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
Come
home
directly
,
Sir
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mother
be----
!
"
returned
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Who
is
it
,
Bess
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
should
I
know
?
"
replied
Edgeworth
Bess
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
it
_
is
_
your
mother
,
send
her
about
her
business
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
I
will
,
"
replied
Jack
,
"
in
the
twinkling
of
a
bedpost
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Glad
to
see
you
once
more
in
the
Mint
,
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
"
roared
Blueskin
,
who
anticipated
some
fun
.
<EOS>
"
Come
and
sit
down
by
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Take
a
glass
of
gin
,
Ma'am
,
"
cried
Poll
Maggot
,
holding
up
a
bottle
of
spirit
;
"
it
used
to
be
your
favourite
liquor
,
I
've
heard
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Jack
,
my
love
,
"
cried
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
disregarding
the
taunt
,
"
come
away
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
I
,
"
replied
Jack
;
"
I
'm
too
comfortable
where
I
am
.
<EOS>
Be
off
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Jack
!
"
exclaimed
his
unhappy
parent
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Sheppard
,
if
you
please
,
Ma'am
,
"
interrupted
the
lad
;
"
I
allow
nobody
to
call
me
Jack
.
<EOS>
Do
I
,
Bess
,
eh
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nobody
whatever
,
love
,
"
replied
Edgeworth
Bess
;
"
nobody
but
me
,
dear
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
me
,
"
insinuated
Mrs.
Maggot
.
<EOS>
"
My
little
fancy
man
's
quite
as
fond
of
me
as
of
you
,
Bess
.
<EOS>
Ai
n't
you
,
Jacky
darling
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
quite
,
Poll
<EOS>
,
"
returned
Mr.
Sheppard
;
"
but
I
love
you
next
to
her
,
and
both
of
you
better
than
_
<EOS>
Her
_
,
"
pointing
with
the
pipe
to
his
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Heavens
!
"
cried
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bravo
!
"
shouted
Blueskin
.
<EOS>
"
Tom
Sheppard
never
said
a
better
thing
than
that
--
ho
!
<EOS>
ho
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Jack
,
"
cried
his
mother
,
wringing
her
hands
in
distraction
,
"
you
'll
break
my
heart
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Poh
!
<EOS>
poh
!
<EOS>
"
returned
her
son
;
"
women
do
n't
so
easily
break
their
hearts
.
<EOS>
Do
they
,
Bess
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
,
"
replied
the
young
lady
appealed
to
,
"
especially
about
their
sons
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Wretch
!
"
cried
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
bitterly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
retorted
Edgeworth
Bess
,
with
a
very
unfeminine
imprecation
,
"
I
sha
n't
stand
any
more
of
that
nonsense
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
by
calling
me
wretch
,
Madam
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
added
marching
up
to
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
and
regarding
her
with
an
insolent
and
threatening
glance
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
--
what
do
you
mean
,
Ma'am
?
<EOS>
"
added
Jack
,
staggering
after
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
with
me
,
my
love
,
come
--
<EOS>
come
,
"
cried
his
mother
,
seizing
his
hand
,
and
endeavouring
to
force
him
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
sha
n't
go
,
"
cried
Edgeworth
Bess
,
holding
him
by
the
other
hand
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
,
Poll
,
help
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
Thus
exhorted
,
Mrs.
Maggot
lent
her
powerful
aid
,
and
,
between
the
two
<EOS>
,
Jack
was
speedily
relieved
from
all
fears
of
being
carried
off
against
his
will
.
<EOS>
Not
content
with
this
exhibition
of
her
prowess
,
the
Amazon
lifted
him
up
as
easily
as
if
he
had
been
an
infant
,
and
placed
him
upon
her
shoulders
,
to
the
infinite
delight
of
the
company
,
and
the
increased
distress
of
his
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
let
's
see
who
'll
dare
to
take
him
down
,
"
she
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nobody
shall
,
"
cried
Mr.
Sheppard
from
his
elevated
position
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
my
own
master
now
,
and
I
'll
do
as
I
please
.
<EOS>
I
'll
turn
cracksman
,
like
my
father
--
<EOS>
rob
old
Wood
<EOS>
--
he
has
chests
full
of
money
,
and
I
know
where
they
're
kept
--
I'll
rob
him
,
and
give
the
swag
to
you
,
Poll
--
<EOS>
I'll--
"
 
Jack
would
have
said
more
;
but
,
losing
his
balance
,
he
fell
to
the
ground
,
and
,
when
taken
up
,
he
was
perfectly
insensible
.
<EOS>
In
this
state
,
he
was
laid
upon
a
bench
,
to
sleep
off
his
drunken
fit
,
while
his
wretched
mother
,
in
spite
of
her
passionate
supplications
and
resistance
,
was
,
by
Blueskin
's
command
,
forcibly
ejected
from
the
house
,
and
driven
out
of
the
Mint
.

CHAPTER
XV
.
 
<EOS>
The
Robbery
in
Willesden
Church
.
  
<EOS>
During
the
whole
of
the
next
day
and
night
,
the
poor
widow
hovered
like
a
ghost
about
the
precincts
of
the
debtors
'
garrison,--for
admission
(
by
the
Master
's
express
orders
,
)
was
denied
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
learn
nothing
of
her
son
,
and
only
obtained
one
solitary
piece
of
information
,
which
added
to
,
rather
than
alleviated
her
misery,--namely
,
that
Jonathan
Wild
had
paid
a
secret
visit
to
the
Cross
Shovels
.
<EOS>
At
one
time
,
she
determined
to
go
to
Wych
Street
,
and
ask
Mr.
Wood
's
advice
and
assistance
,
but
the
thought
of
the
reception
she
was
likely
to
meet
with
from
his
wife
deterred
her
from
executing
this
resolution
.
<EOS>
Many
other
expedients
occurred
to
her
;
but
after
making
several
ineffectual
attempts
to
get
into
the
Mint
unobserved
,
they
were
all
abandoned
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
about
an
hour
before
dawn
on
the
second
day
--
Sunday
--
having
spent
the
early
part
of
the
night
in
watching
at
the
gates
of
the
robbers
'
sanctuary
,
and
being
almost
exhausted
from
want
of
rest
,
she
set
out
homewards
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
long
walk
she
had
to
undertake
,
even
if
she
had
endured
no
previous
fatigue
,
but
feeble
as
she
was
,
it
was
almost
more
than
she
could
accomplish
.
<EOS>
Daybreak
found
her
winding
her
painful
way
along
the
Harrow
Road
;
and
,
in
order
to
shorten
the
distance
as
much
as
possible
,
she
took
the
nearest
cut
,
and
struck
into
the
meadows
on
the
right
.
<EOS>
Crossing
several
fields
,
newly
mown
,
or
filled
with
lines
of
tedded
hay
,
she
arrived
,
not
without
great
exertion
,
at
the
summit
of
a
hill
.
<EOS>
Here
her
strength
completely
failed
her
,
and
she
was
compelled
to
seek
some
repose
.
<EOS>
Making
her
couch
upon
a
heap
of
hay
,
she
sank
at
once
into
a
deep
and
refreshing
slumber
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
awoke
,
the
sun
was
high
in
Heaven
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
bright
and
beautiful
day
:
_
so
<EOS>
_
bright
,
so
beautiful
,
that
even
her
sad
heart
was
cheered
by
it
.
<EOS>
The
air
,
perfumed
with
the
delicious
fragrance
of
the
new
-
mown
grass
,
was
vocal
with
the
melodies
of
the
birds
;
the
thick
foliage
of
the
trees
was
glistening
in
the
sunshine
;
all
nature
seemed
happy
and
rejoicing
;
but
,
above
all
,
the
serene
Sabbath
stillness
reigning
around
communicated
a
calm
to
her
wounded
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
contrast
did
the
lovely
scene
she
now
gazed
upon
present
to
the
squalid
neighbourhood
she
had
recently
quitted
!
<EOS>
On
all
sides
,
expanded
prospects
of
country
the
most
exquisite
and
most
varied
.
<EOS>
Immediately
beneath
her
lay
Willesden,--the
most
charming
and
secluded
village
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
metropolis
--
with
its
scattered
farm
-
houses
,
its
noble
granges
,
and
its
old
grey
church
-
tower
just
peeping
above
a
grove
of
rook
-
haunted
trees
.
 
<EOS>
Towards
this
spot
Mrs.
Sheppard
now
directed
her
steps
.
<EOS>
She
speedily
reached
her
own
abode,--a
little
cottage
,
standing
in
the
outskirts
of
the
village
.
<EOS>
The
first
circumstance
that
struck
her
on
her
arrival
seemed
ominous
.
<EOS>
Her
clock
had
stopped
--
stopped
at
the
very
hour
on
which
she
had
quitted
the
Mint
!
<EOS>
She
had
not
the
heart
to
wind
it
up
again
.
 
<EOS>
After
partaking
of
some
little
refreshment
,
and
changing
her
attire
,
Mrs.
Sheppard
prepared
for
church
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
she
had
so
far
succeeded
in
calming
herself
,
that
she
answered
the
greetings
of
the
neighbours
whom
she
encountered
on
her
way
to
the
sacred
edifice
--
if
sorrowfully
,
still
composedly
.
 
<EOS>
Every
old
country
church
is
beautiful
,
but
Willesden
is
the
most
beautiful
country
church
we
know
;
and
in
Mrs.
Sheppard
's
time
it
was
even
more
beautiful
than
at
present
,
when
the
hand
of
improvement
has
proceeded
a
little
too
rashly
with
alterations
and
repairs
.
<EOS>
With
one
or
two
exceptions
,
there
were
no
pews
;
and
,
as
the
intercourse
with
London
was
then
but
slight
,
the
seats
were
occupied
almost
exclusively
by
the
villagers
.
<EOS>
In
one
of
these
seats
,
at
the
end
of
the
aisle
farthest
removed
from
the
chancel
,
the
widow
took
her
place
,
and
addressed
herself
fervently
to
her
devotions
.
 
<EOS>
The
service
had
not
proceeded
far
,
when
she
was
greatly
disturbed
by
the
entrance
of
a
person
who
placed
himself
opposite
her
,
and
sought
to
attract
her
attention
by
a
number
of
little
arts
,
surveying
her
,
as
he
did
so
,
with
a
very
impudent
and
offensive
stare
.
<EOS>
With
this
person
--
who
was
no
other
than
Mr.
Kneebone
--
she
was
too
well
acquainted
;
having
,
more
than
once
,
been
obliged
to
repel
his
advances
;
and
,
though
his
impertinence
would
have
given
her
little
concern
at
another
season
,
it
now
added
considerably
to
her
distraction
.
<EOS>
But
a
far
greater
affliction
was
in
store
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
Just
as
the
clergyman
approached
the
altar
,
she
perceived
a
boy
steal
quickly
into
the
church
,
and
ensconce
himself
behind
the
woollen
-
draper
,
<EOS>
who
,
in
order
to
carry
on
his
amatory
pursuits
with
greater
convenience
,
and
at
the
same
time
display
his
figure
(
of
which
he
was
not
a
little
vain
)
to
the
utmost
advantage
,
preferred
a
standing
to
a
sitting
posture
.
<EOS>
Of
this
boy
she
had
only
caught
a
glimpse;--but
that
glimpse
was
sufficient
to
satisfy
her
<EOS>
it
was
her
son,--and
,
if
she
could
have
questioned
her
own
instinctive
love
,
she
could
not
question
her
antipathy
,
when
she
beheld
,
partly
concealed
by
a
pillar
immediately
in
the
rear
of
the
woollen
-
draper
,
the
dark
figure
and
truculent
features
of
Jonathan
Wild
.
<EOS>
As
she
looked
in
this
direction
,
the
thief
-
taker
raised
his
eyes
--
those
gray
,
blood
-
thirsty
eyes!--their
glare
froze
the
life
-
blood
in
her
veins
.
 
<EOS>
As
she
averted
her
gaze
,
a
terrible
idea
crossed
her
.
<EOS>
Why
was
he
there
?
<EOS>
why
did
the
tempter
dare
to
invade
that
sacred
spot
!
<EOS>
She
could
not
answer
her
own
questions
,
but
vague
fearful
suspicions
passed
through
her
mind
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
service
proceeded
;
and
the
awful
command
,
"
_
Thou
shalt
not
steal
_
!
"
<EOS>
was
solemnly
uttered
by
the
preacher
,
when
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
who
had
again
looked
round
towards
her
son
,
beheld
a
hand
glance
along
the
side
of
the
woollen
-
draper
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
see
what
occurred
,
though
she
guessed
it
;
but
she
saw
Jonathan
's
devilish
triumphing
glance
,
and
read
in
it,--"Your
son
has
committed
a
robbery
--
here
--
in
these
holy
walls
--
he
is
mine
--
mine
for
ever
!
"
 
<EOS>
She
uttered
a
loud
scream
,
and
fainted
.

CHAPTER
XVI
.
 
<EOS>
Jonathan
Wild
's
House
in
the
Old
Bailey
.
  
<EOS>
Just
as
St.
Sepulchre
's
church
struck
one
,
on
the
eventful
night
of
the
10th
of
June
,
(
to
which
it
will
not
be
necessary
to
recur
,
)
<EOS>
a
horseman
,
mounted
on
a
powerful
charger
,
and
followed
at
a
respectful
distance
by
an
attendant
,
galloped
into
the
open
space
fronting
Newgate
,
and
directed
his
course
towards
a
house
in
the
Old
Bailey
.
<EOS>
Before
he
could
draw
in
the
rein
,
his
steed
--
startled
apparently
by
some
object
undistinguishable
by
the
rider,--swerved
with
such
suddenness
as
to
unseat
him
,
and
precipitate
him
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
,
however
,
he
was
picked
up
,
and
set
upon
his
feet
by
a
person
who
,
having
witnessed
the
accident
,
flew
across
the
road
to
his
assistance
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
not
hurt
<EOS>
I
hope
,
Sir
Rowland
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
this
individual
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
materially
,
Mr.
Wild
,
"
replied
the
other
,
"
a
little
shaken
,
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
Curses
light
on
the
horse
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
seizing
the
bridle
of
his
steed
,
who
continued
snorting
and
shivering
,
as
if
still
under
the
influence
of
some
unaccountable
alarm
;
"
what
can
ail
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
_
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
_
know
what
ails
him
,
your
honour
,
"
rejoined
the
groom
,
riding
up
as
he
spoke
;
"
he
's
seen
somethin'
not
o
'
this
world
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Most
likely
,
"
observed
Jonathan
,
with
a
slight
sneer
;
"
the
ghost
of
some
highwayman
who
has
just
breathed
his
last
in
Newgate
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
May
be
,
"
returned
the
man
gravely
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
him
home
,
Saunders
,
"
said
Sir
Rowland
,
resigning
his
faulty
steed
to
the
attendant
's
care
,
"
I
shall
not
require
you
further
.
<EOS>
Strange
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
as
the
groom
departed
;
"
Bay
Stuart
has
carried
me
through
a
hundred
dangers
,
but
never
played
me
such
a
trick
before
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
never
should
again
,
were
he
mine
,
"
rejoined
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
If
the
best
nag
ever
foaled
were
to
throw
me
in
this
unlucky
spot
,
I
'd
blow
his
brains
out
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
,
Sir
?
"
asked
Trenchard
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
fall
against
Newgate
is
accounted
a
sign
of
death
by
the
halter
,
"
replied
Wild
,
with
ill
-
disguised
malignity
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tush
!
"
exclaimed
Sir
Rowland
,
angrily
.
 
<EOS>
"
From
that
door
,
"
continued
the
thief
-
taker
,
pointing
to
the
gloomy
portal
of
the
prison
opposite
which
they
were
standing
,
"
the
condemned
are
taken
to
Tyburn
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
bad
omen
to
be
thrown
near
that
door
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
suspect
you
of
so
much
superstition
,
Mr.
Wild
,
"
observed
the
knight
,
contemptuously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Facts
convince
the
most
incredulous
,
"
answered
Jonathan
,
drily
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
known
several
cases
where
the
ignominious
doom
I
've
mentioned
has
been
foretold
by
such
an
accident
as
has
just
befallen
you
.
<EOS>
There
was
Major
Price
<EOS>
--
you
must
recollect
him
,
Sir
Rowland,--he
stumbled
as
he
was
getting
out
of
his
chair
at
that
very
gate
.
<EOS>
Well
,
_
he
_
was
executed
for
murder
.
<EOS>
Then
there
was
Tom
Jarrot
,
the
hackney
-
coachman
,
who
was
pitched
off
the
box
against
yonder
curbstone
,
and
broke
his
leg
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
pity
he
did
n't
break
his
neck
,
for
he
was
hanged
within
the
year
.
<EOS>
Another
instance
was
that
of
Toby
Tanner--
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
more
of
this
,
"
interrupted
Trenchard
;
"
where
is
the
boy
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
far
hence
,
"
replied
Wild
.
"
<EOS>
After
all
our
pains
we
were
near
losing
him
,
Sir
Rowland
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
so
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
other
,
distrustfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
hear
,
"
returned
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
the
help
of
his
comrade
,
Jack
Sheppard
,
the
young
rascal
made
a
bold
push
to
get
out
of
the
round
-
house
,
where
my
janizaries
had
lodged
him
,
and
would
have
succeeded
too
,
if
,
by
<EOS>
good
luck,--for
<EOS>
the
devil
never
deserts
so
useful
an
agent
as
I
am
,
Sir
Rowland,--I
had
n't
arrived
in
time
to
prevent
him
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
my
oldest
and
trustiest
setter
,
Abraham
Mendez
,
received
a
blow
on
the
head
from
one
of
the
lads
that
will
deprive
me
of
his
services
for
a
week
to
come,--if
,
indeed
it
does
not
disable
him
altogether
.
<EOS>
However
,
if
I
've
lost
one
servant
,
I
've
gained
another
,
that
's
one
comfort
.
<EOS>
Jack
Sheppard
is
now
wholly
in
my
hands
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
this
to
me
,
Sir
?
"
said
Trenchard
,
cutting
him
short
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
whatever
,
"
rejoined
the
thief
-
taker
,
coldly

"
But
it
is
much
to
me
.
<EOS>
Jack
Sheppard
is
to
me
what
Thames
Darrell
is
to
you
--
an
object
of
hatred
.
<EOS>
I
owed
his
father
a
grudge
:
that
I
settled
long
ago
.
<EOS>
I
owe
his
mother
one
,
and
will
repay
the
debt
,
with
interest
,
to
her
son
.
<EOS>
I
could
make
away
with
him
at
once
,
as
you
are
about
to
make
away
with
your
nephew
,
Sir
Rowland,--but
that
would
n't
serve
my
turn
.
<EOS>
To
be
complete
,
my
vengeance
must
be
tardy
.
<EOS>
Certain
of
my
prey
,
I
can
afford
to
wait
for
it
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
revenge
is
sweetened
by
delay
;
and
I
indulge
too
freely
in
the
passion
to
rob
it
of
any
of
its
zest
.
<EOS>
I
've
watched
this
lad
--
this
Sheppard
--
from
infancy
;
and
,
though
I
have
apparently
concerned
myself
little
about
him
,
I
have
never
lost
sight
of
my
purpose
.
<EOS>
I
have
suffered
him
to
be
brought
up
decently
--
honestly
;
because
I
would
make
his
fall
the
greater
,
and
deepen
the
wound
I
meant
to
inflict
upon
his
mother
.
<EOS>
From
this
night
I
shall
pursue
a
different
course
;
from
this
night
his
ruin
may
be
dated
.
<EOS>
He
is
in
the
care
of
those
who
will
not
leave
the
task
assigned
to
them
--
the
utter
perversion
of
his
principles
--
half
-
finished
.
<EOS>
And
when
I
have
steeped
him
to
the
lips
in
vice
and
depravity
;
when
I
have
led
him
to
the
commission
of
every
crime
;
when
there
is
neither
retreat
nor
advance
for
him
;
when
he
has
plundered
his
benefactor
,
and
broken
the
heart
of
his
mother
--
then
--
but
not
till
then
,
I
will
consign
him
to
the
fate
to
which
I
consigned
his
father
.
<EOS>
This
I
have
sworn
to
do
--
this
I
will
do
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
unless
your
skull
's
bullet
-
proof
,
"
cried
a
voice
at
his
elbow
;
and
,
as
the
words
were
uttered
,
a
pistol
was
snapped
at
his
head
,
which,--fortunately
or
unfortunately
,
as
the
reader
pleases,--only
burnt
the
priming
.
<EOS>
The
blaze
,
however
,
was
sufficient
to
reveal
to
the
thief
-
taker
the
features
of
his
intended
assassin
.
<EOS>
They
were
those
of
the
Irish
watchman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
Terry
O'Flaherty
!
"
<EOS>
vociferated
Jonathan
,
in
a
tone
that
betrayed
hot
the
slightest
discomposure
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
Terry
O'Flaherty
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
shouting
after
the
Irishman
,
who
took
to
his
heels
as
soon
as
he
found
his
murderous
attempt
unsuccessful
;
"
you
may
run
,
but
you
'll
not
get
out
of
my
reach
.
<EOS>
I
'll
put
a
brace
of
dogs
on
your
track
,
who
'll
soon
hunt
you
down
.
<EOS>
You
shall
swing
for
this
after
next
sessions
,
or
my
name
's
not
Jonathan
Wild
.
<EOS>
I
told
you
,
Sir
Rowland
,
"
he
added
,
turning
to
the
knight
,
and
chuckling
,
"
the
devil
never
deserts
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Conduct
me
to
your
dwelling
,
Sir
,
without
further
delay
,
"
said
Trenchard
,
sternly,--"to
the
boy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
boy
's
not
at
my
house
,
"
replied
Wild
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
is
he
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
other
,
hastily
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
a
place
we
call
the
Dark
House
at
Queenhithe
,
"
answered
Jonathan
,
"
a
sort
of
under
-
ground
tavern
or
night
-
cellar
,
close
to
the
river
-
side
,
and
frequented
by
the
crew
of
the
Dutch
skipper
,
to
whose
care
he
's
to
be
committed
.
<EOS>
You
need
have
no
apprehensions
about
him
,
Sir
Rowland
.
<EOS>
He
's
safe
enough
now
.
<EOS>
I
left
him
in
charge
of
Quilt
Arnold
and
Rykhart
Van
Galgebrok
--
the
skipper
I
spoke
of
--
with
strict
orders
to
shoot
him
if
he
made
any
further
attempt
at
escape
;
and
they
're
not
lads
--
the
latter
especially
--
to
be
trifled
with
.
<EOS>
I
deemed
it
more
prudent
to
send
him
to
the
Dark
House
than
to
bring
him
here
,
in
case
of
any
search
after
him
by
his
adoptive
father
--
the
carpenter
Wood
.
<EOS>
If
you
choose
,
you
can
see
him
put
on
board
the
Zeeslang
yourself
,
Sir
Rowland
.
<EOS>
But
,
perhaps
,
you
'll
first
accompany
me
to
my
dwelling
for
a
moment
,
that
we
may
arrange
our
accounts
before
we
start
.
<EOS>
I
've
a
few
necessary
directions
to
leave
with
my
people
,
to
put
'em
on
their
guard
against
the
chance
of
a
surprise
.
<EOS>
Suffer
me
to
precede
you
.
<EOS>
This
way
,
Sir
Rowland
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
thief
-
taker
's
residence
was
a
large
dismal
-
looking
,
habitation
,
separated
from
the
street
by
a
flagged
court
-
yard
,
and
defended
from
general
approach
by
an
iron
railing
.
<EOS>
Even
in
the
daylight
,
it
had
a
sombre
and
suspicious
air
,
and
seemed
to
slink
back
from
the
adjoining
houses
,
as
if
afraid
of
their
society
.
<EOS>
In
the
obscurity
in
which
it
was
now
seen
,
it
looked
like
a
prison
,
and
,
indeed
,
it
was
Jonathan
's
fancy
to
make
it
resemble
one
as
much
as
possible
.
<EOS>
The
windows
were
grated
<EOS>
,
the
doors
barred
;
each
room
had
the
name
as
well
as
the
appearance
of
a
cell
;
and
the
very
porter
who
stood
at
the
gate
,
habited
like
a
jailer
,
with
his
huge
bunch
of
keys
at
his
girdle
,
his
forbidding
countenance
and
surly
demeanour
seemed
to
be
borrowed
from
Newgate
.
<EOS>
The
clanking
of
chains
,
the
grating
of
locks
,
and
the
rumbling
of
bolts
must
have
been
music
in
Jonathan
's
ears
,
so
much
pains
did
he
take
to
subject
himself
to
such
sounds
.
<EOS>
The
scanty
furniture
of
the
rooms
corresponded
with
their
dungeon
-
like
aspect
.
<EOS>
The
walls
were
bare
,
and
painted
in
stone
-
colour
;
the
floors
,
devoid
of
carpet
;
the
beds
,
of
hangings
;
the
windows
,
of
blinds
;
and
,
excepting
in
the
thief
-
taker
's
own
audience
-
chamber
,
there
was
not
a
chair
or
a
table
about
the
premises
;
the
place
of
these
conveniences
being
elsewhere
supplied
by
benches
,
and
deal
-
boards
laid
across
joint
-
stools
.
<EOS>
Great
stone
staircases
leading
no
one
knew
whither
,
and
long
gloomy
passages
,
impressed
the
occasional
visitor
with
the
idea
that
he
was
traversing
a
building
of
vast
extent
;
and
,
though
this
was
not
the
case
in
reality
,
the
deception
was
so
cleverly
contrived
that
it
seldom
failed
of
producing
the
intended
effect
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
any
one
entered
Mr.
Wild
's
dwelling
without
apprehension
,
or
quitted
it
without
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
More
strange
stories
were
told
of
it
than
of
any
other
house
in
London
.
<EOS>
The
garrets
were
said
to
be
tenanted
by
coiners
,
and
artists
employed
in
altering
watches
and
jewelry
;
the
cellars
to
be
used
as
a
magazine
for
stolen
goods
.
<EOS>
By
some
it
was
affirmed
that
a
subterranean
communication
existed
between
the
thief
-
taker
's
abode
and
Newgate
,
by
means
of
which
he
was
enabled
to
maintain
a
secret
correspondence
with
the
imprisoned
felons
:
by
others
,
that
an
under
-
ground
passage
led
to
extensive
vaults
,
where
such
malefactors
as
he
chose
to
screen
from
justice
might
lie
concealed
till
the
danger
was
blown
over
.
<EOS>
Nothing
,
in
short
,
was
too
extravagant
to
be
related
of
it
;
and
Jonathan
,
who
delighted
in
investing
himself
and
his
residence
with
mystery
,
encouraged
,
and
perhaps
originated
,
these
marvellous
tales
.
<EOS>
However
this
may
be
,
such
was
the
ill
report
of
the
place
that
few
passed
along
the
Old
Bailey
without
bestowing
a
glance
of
fearful
curiosity
at
its
dingy
walls
,
and
wondering
what
was
going
on
inside
them
;
while
fewer
still
,
of
those
who
paused
at
the
door
,
read
,
without
some
internal
trepidation
,
the
formidable
name
--
inscribed
in
large
letters
on
its
bright
brass
-
plate
--
of
JONATHAN
WILD
.
 
<EOS>
Arrived
at
his
habitation
,
Jonathan
knocked
in
a
peculiar
manner
at
the
door
,
which
was
instantly
opened
by
the
grim
-
visaged
porter
just
alluded
to
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
had
Trenchard
crossed
the
threshold
than
a
fierce
barking
was
heard
at
the
farther
extremity
of
the
passage
,
and
,
the
next
moment
,
a
couple
of
mastiffs
of
the
largest
size
rushed
furiously
towards
him
.
<EOS>
The
knight
stood
upon
his
defence
;
but
he
would
unquestionably
have
been
torn
in
pieces
by
the
savage
hounds
,
if
a
shower
of
oaths
,
seconded
by
a
vigorous
application
of
kicks
and
blows
from
their
master
,
had
not
driven
them
growling
off
.
<EOS>
Apologizing
to
Sir
Rowland
for
this
unpleasant
reception
,
and
swearing
lustily
at
his
servant
for
occasioning
it
by
leaving
the
dogs
at
liberty
,
Jonathan
ordered
the
man
to
light
them
to
the
audience
-
room
.
<EOS>
The
command
was
sullenly
obeyed
,
for
the
fellow
did
not
appear
to
relish
the
rating
.
<EOS>
Ascending
the
stairs
,
and
conducting
them
along
a
sombre
gallery
,
in
which
Trenchard
noticed
that
every
door
was
painted
black
,
and
numbered
,
he
stopped
at
the
entrance
of
a
chamber
;
and
,
selecting
a
key
from
the
bunch
at
his
girdle
,
unlocked
it
.
<EOS>
Following
his
guide
,
Sir
Rowland
found
himself
in
a
large
and
lofty
apartment
,
the
extent
of
which
he
could
not
entirely
discern
until
lights
were
set
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
He
then
looked
around
him
with
some
curiosity
;
and
,
as
the
thief
-
taker
was
occupied
in
giving
directions
to
his
attendant
in
an
undertone
,
ample
leisure
was
allowed
him
for
investigation
.
<EOS>
At
the
first
glance
,
he
imagined
he
must
have
stumbled
upon
a
museum
of
rarities
,
there
were
so
many
glass
-
cases
,
so
many
open
cabinets
,
ranged
against
the
walls
;
but
the
next
convinced
him
that
if
Jonathan
was
a
virtuoso
,
his
tastes
did
not
run
in
the
ordinary
channels
.
<EOS>
Trenchard
was
tempted
to
examine
the
contents
of
some
of
these
cases
,
but
a
closer
inspection
made
him
recoil
from
them
in
disgust
.
<EOS>
In
the
one
he
approached
was
gathered
together
a
vast
assortment
of
weapons
,
each
of
which
,
as
appeared
from
the
ticket
attached
to
it
,
had
been
used
as
an
instrument
of
destruction
.
<EOS>
On
this
side
was
a
razor
with
which
a
son
had
murdered
his
father
;
the
blade
notched
,
the
haft
crusted
with
blood
:
on
that
,
a
bar
of
iron
,
bent
,
and
partly
broken
,
with
which
a
husband
had
beaten
out
his
wife
's
brains
.
<EOS>
As
it
is
not
,
however
,
our
intention
to
furnish
a
complete
catalogue
of
these
curiosities
,
we
shall
merely
mention
that
in
front
of
them
lay
a
large
and
sharp
knife
,
once
the
property
of
the
public
executioner
,
and
used
by
him
to
dissever
the
limbs
of
those
condemned
to
death
for
high
-
treason
;
together
with
an
immense
two
-
pronged
flesh
-
fork
,
likewise
employed
by
the
same
terrible
functionary
to
plunge
the
quarters
of
his
victims
in
the
caldrons
of
boiling
tar
and
oil
.
<EOS>
Every
gibbet
at
Tyburn
and
Hounslow
appeared
to
have
been
plundered
of
its
charnel
spoil
to
enrich
the
adjoining
cabinet
,
so
well
was
it
stored
with
skulls
and
bones
,
all
purporting
to
be
the
relics
of
highwaymen
famous
in
their
day
.
<EOS>
Halters
,
each
of
which
had
fulfilled
its
destiny
,
formed
the
attraction
of
the
next
compartment
;
while
a
fourth
was
occupied
by
an
array
of
implements
of
housebreaking
almost
innumerable
,
and
utterly
indescribable
.
<EOS>
All
these
interesting
objects
were
carefully
arranged
,
classed
,
and
,
as
we
have
said
,
labelled
by
the
thief
-
taker
.
<EOS>
From
this
singular
collection
Trenchard
turned
to
regard
its
possessor
,
who
was
standing
at
a
little
distance
from
him
,
still
engaged
in
earnest
discourse
with
his
attendant
,
and
,
as
he
contemplated
his
ruthless
countenance
,
on
which
duplicity
and
malignity
had
set
their
strongest
seals
,
he
could
not
help
calling
to
mind
all
he
had
heard
of
Jonathan
's
perfidiousness
to
his
employers
,
and
deeply
regretting
that
he
had
placed
himself
in
the
power
of
so
unscrupulous
a
miscreant
.
 
<EOS>
Jonathan
Wild
,
at
this
time
,
was
on
the
high
-
road
to
the
greatness
which
he
subsequently
,
and
not
long
afterwards
,
obtained
.
<EOS>
He
was
fast
rising
to
an
eminence
that
no
one
of
his
nefarious
profession
ever
reached
before
him
,
nor
,
it
is
to
be
hoped
,
will
ever
reach
again
.
<EOS>
He
was
the
Napoleon
of
knavery
,
and
established
an
uncontrolled
empire
over
all
the
practitioners
of
crime
.
<EOS>
This
was
no
light
conquest
;
nor
was
it
a
government
easily
maintained
.
<EOS>
Resolution
,
severity
,
subtlety
,
were
required
for
it
;
and
these
were
qualities
which
Jonathan
possessed
in
an
extraordinary
degree
.
<EOS>
The
danger
or
difficulty
of
an
exploit
never
appalled
him
.
<EOS>
What
his
head
conceived
his
hand
executed
.
<EOS>
Professing
to
stand
between
the
robber
and
the
robbed
,
he
himself
plundered
both
.
<EOS>
He
<EOS>
it
was
who
formed
the
grand
design
of
a
robber
corporation
,
of
which
he
should
be
the
sole
head
and
director
,
with
the
right
of
delivering
those
who
concealed
their
booty
,
or
refused
to
share
it
with
him
,
to
the
gallows
.
<EOS>
He
divided
London
into
districts
;
appointed
a
gang
to
each
district
;
and
a
leader
to
each
gang
,
whom
he
held
responsible
to
himself
.
<EOS>
The
country
was
partitioned
in
a
similar
manner
.
<EOS>
Those
whom
he
retained
about
his
person
,
or
placed
in
offices
of
trust
,
were
for
the
most
part
convicted
felons
,
who
,
having
returned
from
transportation
before
their
term
had
expired
,
constituted
,
in
his
opinion
,
the
safest
agents
,
inasmuch
as
they
could
neither
be
legal
evidences
against
him
,
nor
withhold
any
portion
of
the
spoil
of
which
he
chose
to
deprive
them
.
<EOS>
But
the
crowning
glory
of
Jonathan
,
that
which
raised
him
above
all
his
predecessors
in
iniquity
,
and
clothed
this
name
with
undying
notoriety
--
was
to
come
.
<EOS>
When
in
the
plenitude
of
his
power
,
he
commenced
a
terrible
trade
,
till
then
unknown
--
namely
,
a
traffic
in
human
blood
.
<EOS>
This
he
carried
on
by
procuring
witnesses
to
swear
away
the
lives
of
those
persons
who
had
incurred
his
displeasure
,
or
whom
it
might
be
necessary
to
remove
.
 
<EOS>
No
wonder
that
Trenchard
,
as
he
gazed
at
this
fearful
being
,
should
have
some
misgivings
cross
him
.
 
<EOS>
Apparently
,
Jonathan
perceived
he
was
an
object
of
scrutiny
;
for
,
hastily
dismissing
his
attendant
,
he
walked
towards
the
knight
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
,
you
're
admiring
my
cabinet
,
Sir
Rowland
,
"
he
remarked
,
with
a
sinister
smile
;
"
it
_
is
_
generally
admired
;
and
,
sometimes
by
parties
who
afterwards
contribute
to
the
collection
<EOS>
themselves,--ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
This
skull
,
"
he
added
,
pointing
to
a
fragment
of
mortality
in
the
case
beside
them
,
"
once
belonged
to
Tom
Sheppard
,
the
father
of
the
lad
I
spoke
of
just
now
.
<EOS>
In
the
next
box
hangs
the
rope
by
which
he
suffered
.
<EOS>
When
I
've
placed
another
skull
and
another
halter
beside
them
,
I
shall
be
contented
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
<EOS>
To
business
,
Sir
!
"
said
the
knight
,
with
a
look
of
abhorrence
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
to
business
,
"
returned
Jonathan
,
grinning
,
"
the
sooner
the
better
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Here
is
the
sum
you
bargained
for
,
"
rejoined
Trenchard
,
flinging
a
pocket
-
book
on
the
table
;
"
count
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
Jonathan
's
eyes
glistened
as
he
told
over
the
notes
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
've
given
me
more
than
the
amount
,
Sir
Rowland
,
"
he
said
,
after
he
had
twice
counted
them
,
"
or
I
've
missed
my
reckoning
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
hundred
pounds
too
much
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Keep
it
,
"
said
Trenchard
,
haughtily
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
place
it
to
your
account
,
Sir
Rowland
,
"
answered
the
thief
-
taker
,
smiling
significantly
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
shall
we
proceed
to
Queenhithe
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Stay
!
"
cried
the
other
,
taking
a
chair
,
"
a
word
with
you
,
Mr.
Wild
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
As
many
as
you
please
,
Sir
Rowland
,
"
replied
Jonathan
,
resuming
his
seat
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
quite
at
your
disposal
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
question
to
propose
to
you
,
"
said
Trenchard
,
"
relating
to--
"
and
he
hesitated
.
 
<EOS>
"
Relating
to
the
father
of
the
boy
--
Thames
Darrell
,
"
supplied
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
I
guessed
what
was
coming
.
<EOS>
You
desire
to
know
who
he
was
,
Sir
Rowland
.
<EOS>
Well
,
you
_
shall
_
know
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Without
further
fee
?
"
inquired
the
knight
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
exactly
,
"
answered
Jonathan
,
drily
.
<EOS>
"
A
secret
is
too
valuable
a
commodity
to
be
thrown
away
.
<EOS>
But
I
said
I
would
n't
drive
a
hard
bargain
with
you
,
and
I
wo
n't
.
<EOS>
We
are
alone
,
Sir
Rowland
,
"
he
added
,
snuffing
the
candles
,
glancing
cautiously
around
,
and
lowering
his
tone
,
"
and
what
you
confide
to
me
<EOS>
shall
never
transpire,--at
least
to
your
disadvantage
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
at
a
loss
to
understand
you
Sir
,
"
,
said
Trenchard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
make
myself
intelligible
before
I
've
done
,
"
rejoined
Wild
.
<EOS>
"
I
need
not
remind
you
,
Sir
Rowland
,
that
I
am
aware
you
are
deeply
implicated
in
the
Jacobite
plot
which
is
now
known
to
be
hatching
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
"
ejaculated
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
therefore
,
"
pursued
Jonathan
,
"
you
are
acquainted
with
all
the
leaders
of
the
proposed
insurrection,--nay
,
must
be
in
correspondence
with
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
right
have
you
to
suppose
this
,
Sir
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Trenchard
,
sternly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
a
moment
's
patience
,
Sir
Rowland
,
"
returned
Wild
;
"
and
you
shall
hear
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
furnish
me
with
a
list
of
these
rebels
,
and
with
proofs
of
their
treason
,
I
will
not
only
insure
your
safety
,
but
will
acquaint
you
with
the
real
name
and
rank
of
your
sister
<EOS>
Aliva
's
husband
,
as
well
as
with
some
particulars
which
will
never
otherwise
reach
your
ears
,
concerning
your
lost
sister
,
Constance
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
sister
Constance
!
"
echoed
the
knight
;
"
what
of
her
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
agree
to
my
proposal
,
then
?
"
said
Jonathan
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
take
me
for
as
great
a
villain
as
yourself
,
Sir
?
"
said
the
knight
,
rising
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
took
you
for
one
who
would
n't
hesitate
to
avail
himself
of
any
advantage
chance
might
throw
in
his
way
,
"
returned
the
thief
-
taker
,
coldly
.
<EOS>
"
I
find
I
was
in
error
.
<EOS>
No
matter
.
<EOS>
A
time
_
may
_
<EOS>
come,--and
<EOS>
that
ere
<EOS>
long,--when
you
will
be
glad
to
purchase
my
secrets
,
and
your
own
safety
,
at
a
dearer
price
than
the
heads
of
your
companions
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
ready
?
"
said
Trenchard
,
striding
towards
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
,
"
replied
Jonathan
,
following
him
,
"
and
so
,
"
he
added
in
an
undertone
,
"
are
your
captors
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
A
moment
afterwards
,
they
quitted
the
house
.
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XVII
.
 
<EOS>
The
Night
-
Cellar
.
  
<EOS>
After
a
few
minutes
'
rapid
walking
,
during
which
neither
party
uttered
a
word
,
Jonathan
Wild
and
his
companion
had
passed
Saint
Paul
's
,
dived
down
a
thoroughfare
on
the
right
,
and
reached
Thames
Street
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
period
of
this
history
,
the
main
streets
of
the
metropolis
were
but
imperfectly
lighted
,
while
the
less
-
frequented
avenues
were
left
in
total
obscurity
;
but
,
even
at
the
present
time
,
the
maze
of
courts
and
alleys
into
which
Wild
now
plunged
,
would
have
perplexed
any
one
,
not
familiar
with
their
intricacies
,
to
thread
them
on
a
dark
night
.
<EOS>
Jonathan
,
however
,
was
well
acquainted
with
the
road
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
it
was
his
boast
that
he
could
find
his
way
through
any
part
of
London
blindfolded
;
and
by
this
time
,
it
would
seem
,
he
had
nearly
arrived
at
his
destination
;
for
,
grasping
his
companion
's
arm
,
he
led
him
along
a
narrow
entry
which
did
not
appear
to
have
an
outlet
,
and
came
to
a
halt
.
<EOS>
Cautioning
the
knight
,
if
he
valued
his
neck
,
to
tread
carefully
,
Jonathan
then
descended
a
steep
flight
of
steps
;
and
,
having
reached
the
bottom
in
safety
,
he
pushed
open
a
door
,
that
swung
back
on
its
hinges
as
soon
as
it
had
admitted
him
;
and
,
followed
by
Trenchard
,
entered
the
night
-
cellar
.
 
<EOS>
The
vault
,
in
which
Sir
Rowland
found
himself
,
resembled
in
some
measure
the
cabin
of
a
ship
.
<EOS>
It
was
long
and
narrow
,
with
a
ceiling
supported
by
huge
uncovered
rafters
,
and
so
low
as
scarcely
to
allow
a
tall
man
like
himself
to
stand
erect
beneath
it
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
heat
of
the
season,--which
was
not
,
however
,
found
particularly
inconvenient
in
this
subterranean
region,--a
large
heaped
-
up
fire
blazed
ruddily
in
one
corner
,
and
lighted
up
a
circle
of
as
villanous
countenances
as
ever
flame
shone
upon
.
 
<EOS>
The
guests
congregated
within
the
night
-
cellar
were
,
in
fact
,
little
better
than
thieves
;
but
thieves
who
confined
their
depredations
almost
exclusively
to
the
vessels
lying
in
the
pool
and
docks
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
They
had
as
many
designations
as
grades
.
<EOS>
There
were
game
watermen
and
game
lightermen
,
heavy
horsemen
and
light
horsemen
,
scuffle
-
hunters
,
and
long
-
apron
men
,
lumpers
,
journeymen
coopers
,
mud
-
larks
,
badgers
,
and
ratcatchers
--
a
race
of
dangerous
vermin
recently
,
in
a
great
measure
,
extirpated
by
the
vigilance
of
the
Thames
Police
,
but
at
this
period
flourishing
in
vast
numbers
.
<EOS>
Besides
these
plunderers
,
there
were
others
with
whom
the
disposal
of
their
pillage
necessarily
brought
them
into
contact
,
and
who
seldom
failed
to
attend
them
during
their
hours
of
relaxation
and
festivity;--to
wit
,
dealers
in
junk
,
old
rags
,
and
marine
stores
,
purchasers
of
prize
-
money
,
crimps
,
and
Jew
receivers
.
<EOS>
The
latter
formed
by
far
the
most
knavish
-
looking
and
unprepossessing
portion
of
the
assemblage
.
<EOS>
One
or
two
of
the
tables
were
occupied
by
groups
of
fat
frowzy
women
in
flat
caps
,
with
rings
on
their
thumbs
,
and
baskets
by
their
sides
;
and
no
one
who
had
listened
for
a
single
moment
to
their
coarse
language
and
violent
abuse
of
each
other
,
would
require
to
be
told
they
were
fish
-
wives
from
Billingsgate
.
 
<EOS>
The
present
divinity
of
the
cellar
was
a
comely
middle
-
aged
dame
,
almost
as
stout
,
and
quite
as
shrill
-
voiced
,
as
the
Billingsgate
fish
-
wives
above
-
mentioned
<EOS>
,
Mrs.
Spurling
,
for
so
was
she
named
,
had
a
warm
nut
-
brown
complexion
,
almost
as
dark
as
a
Creole
;
and
a
moustache
on
her
upper
lip
,
that
would
have
done
no
discredit
to
the
oldest
dragoon
in
the
King
's
service
.
<EOS>
This
lady
was
singularly
lucky
in
her
matrimonial
connections
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
married
four
times
:
three
of
her
husbands
died
of
hempen
fevers
;
and
the
fourth
,
having
been
twice
condemned
,
was
saved
from
the
noose
by
Jonathan
Wild
,
who
not
only
managed
to
bring
him
off
,
but
to
obtain
for
him
the
situation
of
under
-
turnkey
in
Newgate
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
appearance
of
the
thief
-
taker
,
Mrs.
Spurling
was
standing
near
the
fire
superintending
some
culinary
preparation
;
but
she
no
sooner
perceived
him
,
than
hastily
quitting
her
occupation
,
she
elbowed
a
way
for
him
and
the
knight
through
the
crowd
,
and
ushered
them
,
with
much
ceremony
,
into
an
inner
room
,
where
they
found
the
objects
of
their
search
,
Quilt
Arnold
and
Rykhart
Van
Galgebrok
,
seated
at
a
small
table
,
quietly
smoking
.
<EOS>
This
service
rendered
,
without
waiting
for
any
farther
order
,
she
withdrew
.
 
<EOS>
Both
the
janizary
and
the
skipper
arose
as
the
others
entered
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
gentleman
,
"
observed
Jonathan
,
introducing
Trenchard
to
the
Hollander
,
"
<EOS>
who
is
about
to
intrust
his
young
relation
to
your
care
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
De
gentleman
may
rely
on
my
showing
his
relation
all
de
attention
in
my
power
,
"
replied
Van
Galgebrok
,
bowing
profoundly
to
the
knight
;
"
but
if
any
unforseen
accident
--
such
as
a
slip
overboard
--
should
befal
de
jonker
on
de
voyage
,
he
mushn't
lay
de
fault
entirely
on
my
shoulders
--
haw
!
<EOS>
haw
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Where
is
he
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Sir
Rowland
,
glancing
uneasily
around
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
De
jonker
.
<EOS>
He
's
here
,
"
returned
the
skipper
,
pointing
significantly
downwards
.
<EOS>
"
Bring
him
out
,
Quilt
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
pushed
aside
the
table
,
and
the
janizary
stooping
down
,
undrew
a
bolt
and
opened
a
trap
-
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
out
!
"
<EOS>
roared
Quilt
,
looking
into
the
aperture
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
wanted
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
as
no
answer
was
returned
,
he
trust
his
arm
up
to
the
shoulder
into
the
hole
,
and
with
some
little
difficulty
and
exertion
of
strength
,
drew
forth
Thames
Darrell
.
 
<EOS>
The
poor
boy
,
whose
hands
were
pinioned
behind
him
,
looked
very
pale
,
but
neither
trembled
,
nor
exhibited
any
other
symptom
of
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
did
n't
you
come
out
when
I
called
you
,
you
young
dog
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Quilt
in
a
savage
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Because
I
knew
what
you
wanted
me
for
!
"
answered
Thames
firmly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
you
did
,
did
you
?
"
said
the
janizary
.
<EOS>
"
And
what
do
you
suppose
we
mean
to
do
with
you
,
eh
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
mean
to
kill
me
,
"
replied
Thames
,
"
by
my
cruel
uncle
's
command
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
there
he
stands
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
as
his
eye
fell
for
the
first
time
upon
Sir
Rowland
.
<EOS>
"
Where
is
my
mother
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
regarding
the
knight
with
a
searching
glance
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
mother
is
dead
,
"
interposed
Wild
,
scowling
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dead
!
"
echoed
the
boy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
no
--
no
!
<EOS>
You
say
this
to
terrify
me
--
to
try
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
not
believe
you
.
<EOS>
Inhuman
as
he
is
,
he
would
not
kill
her
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
Sir
,
"
he
added
,
advancing
towards
the
knight
,
"
tell
me
has
this
man
spoken
falsely?--Tell
<EOS>
me
my
mother
is
alive
,
and
do
what
you
please
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Tell
him
so
,
and
have
done
with
him
,
Sir
Rowland
,
"
observed
Jonathan
coldly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
the
truth
,
I
implore
you
,
"
cried
Thames
.
<EOS>
"
Is
she
alive
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
not
,
"
replied
Trenchard
,
overcome
by
conflicting
emotions
,
and
unable
to
endure
the
boy
's
agonized
look
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
answered
?
"
said
Jonathan
,
with
a
grin
worthy
of
a
demon
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
mother!--my
poor
mother
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Thames
,
falling
on
his
knees
,
and
bursting
into
tears
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
I
never
see
that
sweet
face
<EOS>
again,--never
feel
the
pressure
of
those
kind
hands
more
--
nor
listen
to
that
gentle
voice
!
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
yes
,
we
shall
meet
again
in
Heaven
,
where
I
shall
speedily
join
you
.
<EOS>
Now
then
,
"
he
added
more
calmly
,
"
I
am
ready
to
die
.
<EOS>
The
only
mercy
you
can
show
me
is
to
kill
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
we
wo
n't
even
show
you
that
mercy
,
"
retorted
the
thief
-
taker
brutally
.
"
<EOS>
So
get
up
,
and
leave
off
whimpering
.
<EOS>
Your
time
is
n't
come
yet
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Wild
,
"
said
Trenchard
,
"
I
shall
proceed
no
further
in
this
business
.
<EOS>
Set
the
boy
free
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
disobey
you
,
Sir
Rowland
,
"
replied
the
thief
-
taker
,
"
you
'll
thank
me
for
it
hereafter
.
<EOS>
Gag
him
,
"
he
added
,
pushing
Thames
rudely
toward
Quilt
Arnold
,
"
and
convey
him
to
the
boat
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
word
,
"
cried
the
boy
,
as
the
janizary
was
preparing
to
obey
his
master
's
orders
.
<EOS>
"
What
has
become
of
Jack
Sheppard
?
"
 
"
Devil
knows
!
"
<EOS>
answered
Quilt
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
believe
he
's
in
the
hands
of
Blueskin
,
so
there
's
no
doubt
he
'll
soon
be
on
the
high
-
road
to
Tyburn
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
Jack
!
"
sighed
Thames
.
<EOS>
"
You
need
n't
gag
me
,
"
he
added
,
"
I
'll
not
cry
out
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
wo
n't
trust
you
,
my
youngster
,
"
answered
the
janizary
.
<EOS>
And
,
thrusting
a
piece
of
iron
into
his
mouth
,
he
forced
him
out
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Rowland
witnessed
these
proceedings
like
one
stupified
.
<EOS>
He
neither
attempted
to
prevent
his
nephew
's
departure
,
nor
to
follow
him
.
 
<EOS>
Jonathan
kept
his
keen
eye
fixed
upon
him
,
as
he
addressed
himself
for
a
moment
to
the
Hollander
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
the
case
of
watches
on
board
?
"
he
asked
in
an
under
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ja
,
"
replied
the
skipper
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
the
rings
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ja
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
well
.
<EOS>
You
must
dispose
of
the
goldsmith
's
note
<EOS>
I
gave
you
yesterday
,
as
soon
as
you
arrive
at
Rotterdam
.
<EOS>
It
'll
be
advertised
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
De
duivel
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Van
Galgebrok
,
"
Very
well
.
<EOS>
It
shall
be
done
as
you
direct
.
<EOS>
But
about
dat
jonker
,
"
he
continued
,
lowering
his
voice
;
"
have
you
anything
to
add
consarnin
'
him
?
<EOS>
It
's
almosht
a
pity
to
put
him
onder
de
water
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Is
the
sloop
ready
to
sail
?
"
asked
Wild
,
without
noticing
the
skipper
's
remark
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ja
,
"
answered
Van
;
"
at
a
minut
's
nodish
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Here
are
your
despatches
,
"
said
Jonathan
with
a
significant
look
,
and
giving
him
a
sealed
packet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Open
them
when
you
get
on
board
--
not
before
,
and
act
as
they
direct
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
ondershtand
,
"
replied
the
skipper
,
putting
his
finger
to
his
nose
;
"
it
shall
be
done
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
Rowland
,
"
said
Jonathan
,
turning
to
the
knight
,
"
will
it
please
you
to
remain
here
till
I
return
,
or
will
you
accompany
us
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
with
you
,
"
answered
Trenchard
,
who
,
by
this
time
,
had
regained
his
composure
,
and
with
it
all
his
relentlessness
of
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
,
then
,
"
said
Wild
,
marching
towards
the
door
,
"
we
've
no
time
to
lose
.
"
 
<EOS>
Quitting
the
night
-
cellar
,
the
trio
soon
arrived
at
the
riverside
.
<EOS>
Quilt
Arnold
was
stationed
at
the
stair
-
head
,
near
which
the
boat
containing
the
captive
boy
was
moored
.
<EOS>
A
few
words
passed
between
him
and
the
thief
-
taker
as
the
latter
came
up
;
after
which
,
all
the
party
--
with
the
exception
of
Quilt
,
who
was
left
on
shore
--
embarked
within
the
wherry
,
which
was
pushed
from
the
strand
and
rowed
swiftly
along
the
stream
--
for
the
tide
was
in
its
favour
--
by
a
couple
of
watermen
.
<EOS>
Though
scarcely
two
hours
past
midnight
,
it
was
perfectly
light
.
<EOS>
The
moon
had
arisen
,
and
everything
could
be
as
plainly
distinguished
as
during
the
day
.
<EOS>
A
thin
mist
lay
on
the
river
,
giving
the
few
craft
moving
about
in
it
a
ghostly
look
.
<EOS>
As
they
approached
London
Bridge
,
the
thief
-
taker
whispered
Van
Galgebrok
,
who
acted
as
steersman
,
to
make
for
a
particular
arch
--
near
the
Surrey
shore
.
<EOS>
The
skipper
obeyed
,
and
in
another
moment
,
they
swept
through
the
narrow
lock
.
<EOS>
While
the
watermen
were
contending
with
the
eddies
occasioned
by
the
fall
below
the
bridge
,
Jonathan
observed
a
perceptible
shudder
run
through
Trenchard
's
frame
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
remember
that
starling
,
Sir
Rowland
,
"
he
said
maliciously
,
"
and
what
occurred
on
it
,
twelve
years
ago
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Too
well
,
"
answered
the
knight
,
frowning
.
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
what
is
that
?
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
pointing
to
a
dark
object
floating
near
them
amid
the
boiling
waves
,
and
which
presented
a
frightful
resemblance
to
a
human
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
'll
see
,
"
returned
the
thief
-
taker
.
<EOS>
And
,
stretching
out
his
hand
,
he
lifted
the
dark
object
from
the
flood
.
 
<EOS>
It
proved
to
be
a
human
head
,
though
with
scarcely
a
vestige
of
the
features
remaining
.
<EOS>
Here
and
there
,
patches
of
flesh
adhered
to
the
bones
,
and
the
dank
dripping
hair
hanging
about
what
had
once
been
the
face
,
gave
it
a
ghastly
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
skull
of
a
_
rebel
_
,
"
said
Jonathan
,
with
marked
emphasis
on
the
word
,
"
blown
by
the
wind
from
a
spike
on
the
bridge
above
us
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
whose
brainless
head
it
may
be
,
but
it
'll
do
for
my
collection
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
tossed
it
carelessly
into
the
bottom
of
the
boat
.
 
<EOS>
After
this
occurence
,
not
a
word
was
exchanged
between
them
until
they
came
in
sight
of
the
sloop
,
which
was
lying
at
anchor
off
Wapping
.
<EOS>
Arrived
at
her
side
,
it
was
soon
evident
,
from
the
throng
of
seamen
in
Dutch
dresses
that
displayed
themselves
,
that
her
crew
were
on
the
alert
,
and
a
rope
having
been
thrown
down
to
the
skipper
,
he
speedily
hoisted
himself
on
deck
.
<EOS>
Preparations
were
next
made
for
taking
Thames
on
board
.
<EOS>
Raising
him
in
his
arms
,
Jonathan
passed
the
rope
round
his
body
,
and
in
this
way
the
poor
boy
was
drawn
up
without
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
While
he
was
swinging
in
mid
air
,
Thames
regarded
his
uncle
with
a
stern
look
,
and
cried
in
a
menacing
voice
,
"
We
shall
meet
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
in
this
world
,
"
returned
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Weigh
anchor
,
Van
!
"
<EOS>
he
shouted
to
the
skipper
,
"
and
consult
your
despatches
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ja
--
ja
,
"
returned
the
Hollander
.
<EOS>
And
catching
hold
of
Thames
,
he
quitted
the
deck
.
 
<EOS>
Shortly
afterwards
,
he
re
-
appeared
with
the
information
that
the
captive
was
safe
below
;
and
giving
the
necessary
directions
to
his
crew
,
before
many
minutes
had
elapsed
,
the
Zeeslang
spread
her
canvass
to
the
first
breeze
of
morning
.
 
<EOS>
By
the
thief
-
taker
's
command
,
the
boat
was
then
rowed
toward
a
muddy
inlet
,
which
has
received
in
more
recent
times
the
name
of
Execution
Dock
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
she
reached
this
spot
,
Wild
sprang
ashore
,
and
was
joined
by
several
persons,--among
whom
was
Quilt
Arnold
,
leading
a
horse
by
the
bridle,--he
hastened
down
the
stairs
to
meet
him
.
<EOS>
A
coach
was
also
in
attendance
,
at
a
little
distance
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Rowland
,
who
had
continued
absorbed
in
thought
,
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
sloop
,
as
she
made
her
way
slowly
down
the
river
,
disembarked
more
leisurely
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
length
I
am
my
own
master
,
"
murmured
the
knight
,
as
his
foot
touched
the
strand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
so
,
Sir
Rowland
,
"
returned
Jonathan
;
"
you
are
my
prisoner
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Trenchard
,
starting
back
and
drawing
his
sword
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
arrested
for
high
treason
,
"
rejoined
Wild
,
presenting
a
pistol
at
his
head
,
while
he
drew
forth
a
parchment,--"here
<EOS>
is
my
warrant
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Traitor
!
"
cried
Sir
Rowland--"damned
--
double
-
dyed
traitor
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Away
with
him
,
"
vociferated
Jonathan
to
his
myrmidons
,
who
,
having
surrounded
Trenchard
,
hurried
him
off
to
the
coach
before
he
could
utter
another
word,--"first
to
Mr.
Walpole
,
and
then
to
Newgate
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
Quilt
,
"
he
continued
,
addressing
the
janizary
,
who
approached
him
with
the
horse
,
"
fly
to
St.
Giles
's
round
-
house
,
and
if
,
through
the
agency
of
that
treacherous
scoundrel
,
Terry
O'Flaherty
,
whom
I
've
put
in
my
Black
List
,
old
Wood
should
have
found
his
way
there
,
and
have
been
detained
by
Sharpies
as
I
directed
,
you
may
release
him
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
care
how
soon
he
learns
that
he
has
lost
his
adopted
son
.
<EOS>
When
I
've
escorted
you
proud
fool
to
his
new
quarters
,
I
'll
proceed
to
the
Mint
and
look
after
Jack
Sheppard
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
he
mounted
his
steed
and
rode
off
.
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XVIII
.
 
<EOS>
How
Jack
Sheppard
broke
out
of
the
Cage
at
Willesden
.
  
<EOS>
The
heart
-
piercing
scream
uttered
by
Mrs.
Sheppard
after
the
commission
of
the
robbery
in
Willesden
church
was
productive
of
unfortunate
consequences
to
her
son
.
<EOS>
Luckily
,
she
was
bereft
of
consciousness
,
and
was
thus
spared
the
additional
misery
of
witnessing
what
afterwards
befell
him
.
<EOS>
Startled
by
the
cry
,
as
may
be
supposed
,
the
attention
of
the
whole
congregation
was
drawn
towards
the
quarter
whence
it
proceeded
.
<EOS>
Amongst
others
,
a
person
near
the
door
,
roused
by
the
shriek
,
observed
a
man
make
his
exit
with
the
utmost
precipitation
.
<EOS>
A
boy
attempted
to
follow
;
but
as
the
suspicions
of
the
lookers
-
on
were
roused
by
the
previous
circumstances
,
the
younger
fugitive
was
seized
and
detained
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Mr.
Kneebone
,
having
been
alarmed
by
something
in
the
widow
's
look
before
her
feelings
found
vent
in
the
manner
above
described
,
thrust
his
hand
instinctively
into
his
coat
in
search
of
his
pocket
-
book,--about
the
security
of
which
,
as
it
contained
several
letters
and
documents
implicating
himself
and
others
in
the
Jacobite
plot
,
he
was
,
not
unnaturally
,
<EOS>
solicitous,--and
finding
it
gone
<EOS>
,
he
felt
certain
he
had
been
robbed
.
<EOS>
Turning
quickly
round
,
in
the
hope
of
discovering
the
thief
,
he
was
no
less
surprised
than
distressed
--
<EOS>
for
in
spite
of
his
faults
,
the
woollen
-
draper
was
a
good
-
natured
fellow
--
to
perceive
Jack
Sheppard
in
custody
.
<EOS>
The
truth
at
once
flashed
across
his
mind
.
<EOS>
This
,
then
,
was
the
cause
of
the
widow
's
wild
inexplicable
look,--of
<EOS>
her
sudden
shriek
!
<EOS>
Explaining
his
suspicious
in
a
whisper
to
Jack
's
captor
,
who
proved
to
be
a
church
-
warden
and
a
constable
,
by
name
John
Dump,--Mr
.
<EOS>
Kneebone
begged
him
to
take
the
prisoner
into
the
churchyard
.
<EOS>
Dump
instantly
complied
,
and
as
soon
as
Jack
was
removed
from
the
sacred
edifice
,
his
person
was
searched
from
head
to
foot
--
but
without
success
.
<EOS>
Jack
submitted
to
this
scrutiny
with
a
very
bad
grace
,
and
vehemently
protested
his
innocence
.
<EOS>
In
vain
did
the
woollen
-
draper
offer
to
set
him
free
if
he
would
restore
the
stolen
article
,
or
give
up
his
associate
,
to
whom
it
was
supposed
he
might
have
handed
it
.
<EOS>
He
answered
with
the
greatest
assurance
,
that
he
knew
nothing
whatever
of
the
matter
--
had
seen
no
pocket
-
book
,
and
no
associate
to
give
up
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
he
content
himself
with
declaring
his
guiltlessness
of
the
crime
imputed
to
him
,
but
began
in
his
turn
to
menace
his
captor
and
accuser
,
loading
the
latter
with
the
bitterest
upbraidings
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
the
churchyard
was
crowded
with
spectators
,
some
of
whom
dispersed
in
different
directions
in
quest
of
the
other
robber
.
<EOS>
But
all
that
could
be
ascertained
in
the
village
was
,
that
a
man
had
ridden
off
a
short
time
before
in
the
direction
of
London
.
<EOS>
Of
this
man
Kneebone
resolved
to
go
in
pursuit
;
and
leaving
Jack
in
charge
of
the
constable
,
he
proceeded
to
the
small
inn,--which
bore
then
,
as
it
bears
now
,
the
name
of
the
Six
Bells,--where
,
summoning
the
hostler
,
his
steed
was
instantly
brought
him
,
and
,
springing
on
its
back
,
he
rode
away
at
full
speed
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
after
a
consultation
between
Mr.
Dump
and
the
village
authorities
,
it
was
agreed
to
lock
up
the
prisoner
in
the
cage
.
<EOS>
As
he
was
conveyed
thither
,
an
incident
occurred
that
produced
a
considerable
impression
on
the
feelings
of
the
youthful
offender
.
<EOS>
Just
as
they
reached
the
eastern
outlet
of
the
churchyard
--
where
the
tall
elms
cast
a
pleasant
shade
over
the
rustic
graves
--
a
momentary
stoppage
took
place
.
<EOS>
At
this
gate
two
paths
meet
.
<EOS>
Down
that
on
the
right
the
young
culprit
was
dragged
--
along
that
on
the
left
a
fainting
woman
was
borne
in
the
arms
of
several
females
.
<EOS>
It
was
his
mother
,
and
as
he
gazed
on
her
pallid
features
and
motionless
frame
,
Jack
's
heart
severely
smote
him
.
<EOS>
He
urged
his
conductors
to
a
quicker
pace
to
get
out
of
sight
of
the
distressing
spectacle
,
and
even
felt
relieved
when
he
was
shut
out
from
it
and
the
execrations
of
the
mob
by
the
walls
of
the
little
prison
.
 
<EOS>
The
cage
at
Willesden
was
,
and
is
--
for
it
is
still
standing
--
<EOS>
a
small
round
building
about
eight
feet
high
,
with
a
pointed
tiled
roof
,
to
which
a
number
of
boards
,
inscribed
with
the
names
of
the
parish
officers
,
and
charged
with
a
multitude
of
admonitory
notices
to
vagrants
and
other
disorderly
persons
,
are
attached
.
<EOS>
Over
these
boards
the
two
arms
of
a
guide
-
post
serve
to
direct
the
way
-
farer
--
on
the
right
hand
to
the
neighbouring
villages
of
Neasdon
and
Kingsbury
,
and
on
the
left
to
the
Edgeware
Road
and
the
healthy
heights
of
Hampstead
.
<EOS>
The
cage
has
a
strong
door
,
with
an
iron
grating
at
the
top
,
and
further
secured
by
a
stout
bolt
and
padlock
.
<EOS>
It
is
picturesquely
situated
beneath
a
tree
on
the
high
road
,
not
far
from
the
little
hostel
before
mentioned
,
and
at
no
great
distance
from
the
church
.
 
<EOS>
For
some
time
after
he
was
locked
up
in
this
prison
<EOS>
Jack
continued
in
a
very
dejected
state
.
<EOS>
Deserted
by
his
older
companion
in
iniquity
,
and
instigator
to
crime
,
he
did
not
know
what
might
become
of
him
;
nor
,
as
we
have
observed
,
was
the
sad
spectacle
he
had
just
witnessed
,
without
effect
.
<EOS>
Though
within
the
last
two
days
he
had
committed
several
heinous
offences
,
and
one
of
a
darker
dye
than
any
with
which
the
reader
has
been
made
acquainted
,
his
breast
was
not
yet
so
callous
as
to
be
wholly
insensible
to
the
stings
of
conscience
.
<EOS>
Wearied
at
length
with
thinking
on
the
past
,
and
terrified
by
the
prospect
of
the
future
,
he
threw
himself
on
the
straw
with
which
the
cage
was
littered
,
and
endeavoured
to
compose
himself
to
slumber
.
<EOS>
When
he
awoke
,
it
was
late
in
the
day
;
but
though
he
heard
voices
outside
,
and
now
and
then
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
face
peeping
at
him
through
the
iron
grating
over
the
door
,
no
one
entered
the
prison
,
or
held
any
communication
with
him
.
<EOS>
Feeling
rather
exhausted
,
it
occurred
to
him
that
possibly
some
provisions
might
have
been
left
by
the
constable
;
and
,
looking
about
,
he
perceived
a
pitcher
of
water
and
a
small
brown
loaf
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
He
ate
of
the
bread
with
great
appetite
,
and
having
drunk
as
much
as
he
chose
of
the
water
,
poured
the
rest
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
His
hunger
satisfied
,
his
spirits
began
to
revive
,
and
with
this
change
of
mood
all
his
natural
audacity
returned
.
<EOS>
And
here
he
was
first
visited
by
that
genius
which
,
in
his
subsequent
career
,
prompted
him
to
so
many
bold
and
successful
attempts
.
<EOS>
Glancing
around
his
prison
,
he
began
to
think
it
possible
he
might
effect
an
escape
from
it
.
<EOS>
The
door
was
too
strong
,
and
too
well
secured
,
to
break
open,--the
walls
too
thick
:
but
the
ceiling,--if
he
could
reach
it
--
there
,
he
doubted
not
,
he
could
make
an
outlet
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
meditating
flight
in
this
way
,
and
tossing
about
on
the
straw
,
he
chanced
upon
an
old
broken
and
rusty
fork
.
<EOS>
Here
was
an
instrument
which
might
be
of
the
greatest
service
to
him
in
accomplishing
his
design
.
<EOS>
He
put
it
carefully
aside
,
resolved
to
defer
the
attempt
till
night
.
<EOS>
Time
wore
on
somewhat
slowly
with
the
prisoner
,
who
had
to
control
his
impatience
in
the
best
way
he
could
;
but
as
the
shades
of
evening
were
darkening
,
the
door
was
unlocked
,
and
Mr.
Dump
popped
his
head
into
the
cage
.
<EOS>
He
brought
another
small
loaf
,
and
a
can
with
which
he
replenished
the
pitcher
,
recommending
Jack
to
be
careful
,
as
he
would
get
nothing
further
till
morning
.
<EOS>
To
this
Jack
replied
,
that
he
should
be
perfectly
contented
,
provided
he
might
have
a
small
allowance
of
gin
.
<EOS>
The
latter
request
,
though
treated
with
supreme
contempt
by
Mr.
Dump
,
made
an
impression
on
some
one
outside
;
for
not
long
after
the
constable
departed
,
Jack
heard
a
tap
at
the
door
,
and
getting
up
at
the
summons
,
he
perceived
the
tube
of
a
pipe
inserted
between
the
bars
.
<EOS>
At
once
divining
the
meaning
of
this
ingenious
device
,
he
applied
his
mouth
to
the
tube
,
and
sucked
away
,
while
the
person
outside
poured
spirit
into
the
bowl
.
<EOS>
Having
drunk
as
much
as
he
thought
prudent
,
and
thanked
his
unknown
friend
for
his
attention
,
Jack
again
lay
down
on
the
straw
,
and
indulged
himself
with
another
nap
,
intending
to
get
up
as
soon
as
it
was
perfectly
dark
.
<EOS>
The
strong
potation
he
had
taken
,
combined
with
fatigue
and
anxiety
he
had
previously
undergone
,
made
him
oversleep
himself
,
and
when
he
awoke
it
was
just
beginning
to
grow
light
.
<EOS>
Cursing
himself
for
his
inertness
,
Jack
soon
shook
off
this
drowsiness
,
and
set
to
work
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
Availing
himself
of
certain
inequalities
in
the
door
,
he
soon
managed
to
climb
up
to
the
roof
;
and
securing
his
feet
against
a
slight
projection
in
the
wall
,
began
to
use
the
fork
with
great
effect
.
<EOS>
Before
many
minutes
elapsed
,
he
had
picked
a
large
hole
in
the
plaster
,
which
showered
down
in
a
cloud
of
dust
;
and
breaking
off
several
laths
,
caught
hold
of
a
beam
,
by
which
he
held
with
one
hand
,
until
with
the
other
he
succeeded
,
not
without
some
difficulty
,
in
forcing
out
one
of
the
tiles
.
<EOS>
The
rest
was
easy
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
more
he
had
made
a
breach
in
the
roof
wide
enough
to
allow
him
to
pass
through
.
<EOS>
Emerging
from
this
aperture
,
he
was
about
to
descend
,
when
he
was
alarmed
by
hearing
the
tramp
of
horses
'
feet
swiftly
approaching
,
and
had
only
time
to
hide
himself
behind
one
of
the
largest
sign
-
boards
before
alluded
to
when
two
horsemen
rode
up
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
passing
on
,
as
Jack
expected
,
these
persons
stopped
opposite
the
cage
,
when
one
of
them
,
as
he
judged
from
the
sound
,
for
he
did
not
dare
to
look
out
of
his
hiding
place
,
dismounted
.
<EOS>
A
noise
was
next
heard
,
as
if
some
instrument
were
applied
to
the
door
with
the
intent
to
force
it
open
,
and
Jack
's
fears
were
at
once
dispelled
,
At
first
,
he
had
imagined
they
were
officers
of
justice
,
come
to
convey
him
to
a
stronger
prison
:
but
the
voice
of
one
of
the
parties
,
which
he
recognised
,
convinced
him
they
were
his
friends
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
quick
,
Blueskin
,
and
be
cursed
to
you
!
"
was
growled
in
the
deep
tones
of
Jonathan
Wild
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
have
the
whole
village
upon
us
while
you
're
striking
the
jigger
.
<EOS>
Use
the
gilt
,
man
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
need
of
picklock
or
crow
-
bar
,
here
,
Mr.
Wild
,
"
cried
Jack
,
placing
his
hat
on
the
right
arm
of
the
guide
-
post
,
and
leaning
over
the
board
,
"
I
've
done
the
trick
myself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
the
devil
's
this
?
"
<EOS>
vociferated
Jonathan
,
looking
up
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
you
broken
out
of
the
cage
,
Jack
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Something
like
it
,
"
replied
the
lad
carelessly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bravo
!
"
cried
the
thief
-
taker
approvingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
that
beats
all
I
ever
heard
of
!
"
<EOS>
roared
Blueskin
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
are
you
really
there
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
'm
here
,
"
answered
Jack
,
leaping
down
.
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
<EOS>
what
,
Mr.
Wild
,
"
he
added
,
laughing
,
"
it
must
be
a
stronger
prison
than
Willesden
cage
that
can
hold
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
"
observed
Jonathan
,
"
you
'll
give
the
keepers
of
his
Majesty
's
jails
some
trouble
before
you
're
many
years
older
<EOS>
,
I
'll
warrant
you
.
<EOS>
But
get
up
behind
,
Blueskin
.
<EOS>
Some
one
may
observe
us
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Come
,
jump
up
,
"
cried
Blueskin
,
mounting
his
steed
,
"
and
I
'll
soon
wisk
you
to
town
.
<EOS>
Edgeworth
Bess
and
Poll
Maggot
are
dying
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
I
thought
Bess
would
have
cried
her
pretty
eyes
out
when
she
heard
you
was
nabbed
.
<EOS>
You
need
give
yourself
no
more
concern
about
Kneebone
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wild
has
done
his
business
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
--
ay
,
"
laughed
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
pocket
-
book
you
prigged
contained
the
letters
I
wanted
.
<EOS>
He
's
now
in
spring
-
ankle
warehouse
with
Sir
Rowland
Trenchard
.
<EOS>
So
get
up
,
and
let
's
be
off
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Before
I
leave
this
place
,
I
must
see
my
mother
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
,
"
returned
Jonathan
gruffly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Would
you
expose
yourself
to
fresh
risk
?
<EOS>
If
it
had
n't
been
for
her
you
would
n't
have
been
placed
in
your
late
jeopardy
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
for
that
,
"
replied
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
See
her
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
_
will
_
.
<EOS>
Leave
me
behind
:
<EOS>
I
'm
not
afraid
.
<EOS>
I
'll
be
at
the
Cross
Shovels
in
the
course
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
if
you
're
bent
upon
this
folly
,
"
observed
Wild
,
who
appeared
to
have
his
own
reasons
for
humouring
the
lad
,
"
I
sha
n't
hinder
you
.
<EOS>
Blueskin
will
take
care
of
the
horses
,
and
I
'll
go
with
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
dismounted
;
and
flinging
his
bridle
to
his
companion
,
and
ordering
him
to
ride
off
to
a
little
distance
,
he
followed
Jack
,
who
had
quitted
the
main
road
,
and
struck
into
a
narrow
path
opposite
the
cage
.
<EOS>
This
path
,
bordered
on
each
side
by
high
privet
hedges
of
the
most
beautiful
green
,
soon
brought
them
to
a
stile
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
the
house
,
"
said
Jack
,
pointing
to
a
pretty
cottage
,
the
small
wooden
porch
of
which
was
covered
with
roses
and
creepers
,
with
a
little
trim
garden
in
front
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
be
back
in
a
minute
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
hurry
yourself
,
"
said
Jonathan
,
"
I
'll
wait
for
you
here
.

CHAPTER
XIX
.
 
<EOS>
Good
and
Evil
.
  
<EOS>
As
Jack
opened
the
gate
,
and
crossed
the
little
garden
,
which
exhibited
in
every
part
the
neatness
and
attention
of
its
owner
,
he
almost
trembled
at
the
idea
of
further
disturbing
her
peace
of
mind
.
<EOS>
Pausing
with
the
intention
of
turning
back
,
he
glanced
in
the
direction
of
the
village
church
,
the
tower
of
which
could
just
be
seen
through
the
trees
.
<EOS>
The
rooks
were
cawing
amid
the
boughs
,
and
all
nature
appeared
awaking
to
happiness
.
<EOS>
From
this
peaceful
scene
Jack
's
eye
fell
upon
Jonathan
,
who
,
seated
upon
the
stile
,
under
the
shade
of
an
elder
tree
,
was
evidently
watching
him
.
<EOS>
A
sarcastic
smile
seemed
to
play
upon
the
chief
-
taker
's
lips
;
and
abashed
at
his
own
irresolution
,
the
lad
went
on
.
 
<EOS>
After
knocking
for
some
time
at
the
door
without
effect
,
he
tried
the
latch
,
and
to
his
surprise
found
it
open
.
<EOS>
He
stepped
in
with
a
heavy
foreboding
of
calamity
.
<EOS>
A
cat
came
and
rubbed
herself
against
him
as
he
entered
the
house
,
and
seemed
by
her
mewing
to
ask
him
for
food
.
<EOS>
That
was
the
only
sound
he
heard
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
was
almost
afraid
of
speaking
;
but
at
length
he
summoned
courage
to
call
out
"
Mother
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Who
's
there
?
"
<EOS>
asked
a
faint
voice
from
the
bed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
son
,
"
answered
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Jack
,
"
exclaimed
the
widow
,
starting
up
and
drawing
back
the
curtain
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Is
it
indeed
you
,
or
am
I
dreaming
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
not
dreaming
,
mother
,
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
come
to
say
good
<EOS>
bye
to
you
,
and
to
assure
you
of
my
safety
before
I
leave
this
place
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Where
are
you
going
?
"
asked
his
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
know
,
"
returned
Jack
;
"
but
it
's
not
safe
for
me
to
remain
much
longer
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
True
,
"
replied
the
widow
,
upon
whom
all
the
terrible
recollections
of
the
day
before
crowded
,
"
I
know
it
is
n't
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
keep
you
long
.
<EOS>
But
tell
me
how
have
you
escaped
from
the
confinement
in
which
you
were
placed
--
come
and
sit
by
me
--
here
--
upon
the
bed
--
give
me
your
hand
--
and
tell
me
all
about
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
Her
son
complied
,
and
sat
down
upon
the
patch
-
work
coverlet
beside
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Jack
,
"
said
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
clasping
him
with
a
hand
that
burnt
with
fever
,
"
I
have
been
ill
--
dreadfully
ill
--
<EOS>
I
believe
delirious
<EOS>
--
I
thought
I
should
have
died
last
night
--
I
wo
n't
tell
you
what
agony
<EOS>
you
have
caused
me
--
I
wo
n't
reproach
you
.
<EOS>
Only
promise
me
to
amend
--
to
quit
your
vile
companions
--
and
I
will
forgive
you
--
will
bless
you
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
my
dear
,
dear
son
,
be
warned
in
time
.
<EOS>
You
are
in
the
hands
of
a
wicked
,
a
terrible
man
,
who
will
not
stop
till
he
has
completed
your

Listen

broken

"
 
<EOS>
"
It

"
returned
Jack
,
sullenly
;
"
I
ca
n't
be
honest
if
I
would
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
do
not
say
so
,
"
replied
his
wretched
parent
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
never
too
late
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
are
in
Jonathan
Wild
's
power
,
<EOS>
for
I
saw
him
near
you
in
the
church
;
and
if
ever
the
enemy
of
mankind
was
permitted
to
take
human
form
,
I
beheld
him
then
.
<EOS>
Beware
of
him
,
my
son
!
<EOS>
Beware
of
him
!
<EOS>
You
know
not
what
villany
he
is
capable
of
.
<EOS>
Be
honest
,
and
you
will
be
happy
.
<EOS>
You
are
yet
a
child
;
and
though
you
have
strayed
from
the
right
path
,
a
stronger
hand
than
your
own
has
led
you
thence
.
<EOS>
Return
,
I
implore
of
you

to
your
master,--to
Mr.
Wood

<EOS>
Acknowledge
your
faults

<EOS>
He
is
all

overlook

for
mine

<EOS>
Return
to
him

I
say--

<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't

replied
Jack
,
doggedly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ca
n't

repeated
his
mother
.
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
_
<EOS>
I
'll
_
tell
you
,
"
cried
a
deep
voice
from
the
back
of
the
bed
.
<EOS>
And
immediately
afterwards
the
curtain
was
drawn
aside
,
and
disclosed
the
Satanic
countenance
of
Jonathan
Wild
,
who
had
crept
into
the
house
unperceived
,
"
I
'll
tell
you
,
why
he
ca
n't
go
back
to
his
master

"
cried
the
thief
-
taker
,
with
a
malignant
grin
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
robbed
him

"
 
<EOS>
"
Robbed
him

screamed
the
widow
.
"
<EOS>
Jack
!
"
 
<EOS>
Her
son
averted
his
gaze
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
robbed
him
,
"
reiterated
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
night
before
last
,
Mr.
Wood
's
house
was
broken
into
and
plundered
.
<EOS>
Your
son
was
seen
by
the
carpenter
's
wife
in
company
with
the
robbers
.
<EOS>
Here
,
"
he
added
,
throwing
a
handbill
on
the
bed
,
"
are
the
particulars
of
the
burglary
,
with
the
reward
for
Jack
's
apprehension

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
ejaculated
the
widow
,
hiding
her
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
,
"
said
Wild
,
turning
authoritatively
to
Jack,--"you
have
overstayed
your
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
go
with
him

Jack

shrieked
his

.
<EOS>
"
Do

Jonathan
,

<EOS>
"
If

I
will
go

cried
Mrs.
Sheppard
:
"

avoid
that

you

<EOS>

Come
along

thundered
Jonathan
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hear

shrieked
his

.
<EOS>
"
You

<EOS>
The
wretch

As
I
hope
for

I
speak
the
truth!--let

him
deny
it
if
he
can

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pshaw
!
"
said
Wild
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
hang
him
now
if
I
liked
.
<EOS>
But
he
may
remain
with
you

I

"
 
<EOS>
"
You

,
my

said
the
widow
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Choose
between
good

evil;--between
him

<EOS>
And
mind

your

hangs
upon

<EOS>
"
It
does
so
,
"
said
Wild
.
<EOS>
"
Choose
,
Jack
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
lad
made
no
answer
,
but
left
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
gone
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs.
Sheppard
despairingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
For

the

preparing

"
Devil

cried
the
widow
,
catching
his
arm
,
and
gazing
with
frantic
eagerness
in
his
face
,
"
how
many

you
give
my

execute
your
terrible

CHAPTER
I.
 
<EOS>
The
Return
.
  
<EOS>
Nearly
nine
years
after
the
events
last
recorded
,
and
about
the
middle
of
May
,
1724
,
a
young
man
of
remarkably
prepossessing
appearance
took
his
way
,
one
afternoon
,
along
Wych
Street
;
and
,
from
the
curiosity
with
which
he
regarded
the
houses
on
the
left
of
the
road
,
seemed
to
be
in
search
of
some
particular
habitation
.
<EOS>
The
age
of
this
individual
could
not
be
more
than
twenty
-
one
;
his
figure
was
tall
,
robust
,
and
gracefully
proportioned
;
and
his
clear
gray
eye
and
open
countenance
bespoke
a
frank
,
generous
,
and
resolute
nature
.
<EOS>
His
features
were
regular
,
and
finely
-
formed
;
his
complexion
bright
and
blooming,--a
<EOS>
little
shaded
,
however
,
by
travel
and
exposure
to
the
sun
;
and
,
with
a
praiseworthy
contempt
for
the
universal
and
preposterous
fashion
then
prevailing
,
of
substituting
a
peruke
for
the
natural
covering
of
the
head
,
he
allowed
his
own
dark
-
brown
hair
to
fall
over
his
shoulders
in
ringlets
as
luxuriant
as
those
that
distinguished
the
court
gallant
in
Charles
the
Second
's
days
--
a
fashion
,
which
we
do
not
despair
of
seeing
revived
in
our
own
days
.
<EOS>
He
wore
a
French
military
undress
of
the
period
,
with
high
jack
-
boots
,
and
a
laced
hat
;
and
,
though
his
attire
indicated
no
particular
rank
,
he
had
completely
the
air
of
a
person
of
distinction
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
effect
produced
upon
the
passengers
by
his
good
looks
and
manly
deportment
,
<EOS>
that
few
--
especially
of
the
gentler
and
more
susceptible
sex
--
failed
to
turn
round
and
bestow
a
second
glance
upon
the
handsome
stranger
.
<EOS>
Unconscious
of
the
interest
he
excited
,
and
entirely
occupied
by
his
own
thoughts
--
which
,
if
his
bosom
could
have
been
examined
,
would
have
been
found
composed
of
mingled
hopes
and
fears
--
the
young
man
walked
on
till
he
came
to
an
old
house
,
with
great
projecting
bay
windows
on
the
first
floor
,
and
situated
as
nearly
as
possible
at
the
back
of
St.
Clement
's
church
.
<EOS>
Here
he
halted
;
and
,
looking
upwards
,
read
,
at
the
foot
of
an
immense
sign
-
board
,
displaying
a
gaudily
-
painted
angel
with
expanded
pinions
and
an
olive
-
branch
,
not
the
name
he
expected
to
find
,
but
that
of
WILLIAM
KNEEBONE
,
WOOLLEN
-
DRAPER
.
 
<EOS>
Tears
started
to
the
young
man
's
eyes
on
beholding
the
change
,
and
it
was
with
difficulty
he
could
command
himself
sufficiently
to
make
the
inquiries
he
desired
to
do
respecting
the
former
owner
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
As
he
entered
the
shop
,
a
tall
portly
personage
advanced
to
meet
him
,
whom
he
at
once
recognised
as
the
present
proprietor
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kneebone
was
attired
in
the
extremity
of
the
mode
.
<EOS>
A
full
-
curled
wig
descended
half
-
way
down
his
back
and
shoulders
;
a
neckcloth
of
"
right
Mechlin
"
was
twisted
round
his
throat
so
tightly
as
almost
to
deprive
him
of
breath
,
and
threaten
him
with
apoplexy
;
he
had
lace
,
also
,
at
his
wrists
and
bosom
;
gold
clocks
to
his
hose
,
and
red
heels
to
his
shoes
.
<EOS>
A
stiff
,
formally
-
cut
coat
of
cinnamon
-
coloured
cloth
,
with
rows
of
plate
buttons
,
each
of
the
size
of
a
crown
piece
,
on
the
sleeves
,
pockets
,
and
skirts
,
reached
the
middle
of
his
legs
;
and
his
costume
was
completed
by
the
silver
-
hilted
sword
at
his
side
,
and
the
laced
hat
under
his
left
arm
.
 
<EOS>
Bowing
to
the
stranger
,
the
woollen
-
draper
very
politely
requested
to
know
his
business
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
almost
afraid
to
state
it
,
"
<EOS>
faltered
the
other
;
"
but
,
may
I
ask
whether
Mr.
Wood
,
the
carpenter
,
who
formerly
resided
here
,
is
still
living
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
feel
any
anxiety
on
his
account
,
Sir
,
I
'm
happy
to
be
able
to
relieve
it
,
"
answered
Kneebone
,
readily
.
<EOS>
"
My
good
friend
,
Owen
Wood,--Heaven
preserve
him!--_is
_
still
living
.
<EOS>
And
,
for
a
man
who
'll
never
see
sixty
again
,
he
's
in
excellent
preservation
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
delight
me
with
the
intelligence
,
"
said
the
stranger
,
entirely
recovering
his
cheerfulness
of
look
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
began
to
fear
,
from
his
having
quitted
the
old
place
,
that
some
misfortune
must
have
befallen
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Quite
the
contrary
,
"
rejoined
the
woollen
-
draper
,
laughing
good
-
humouredly
.
<EOS>
"
Everything
has
prospered
with
him
in
an
extraordinary
manner
.
<EOS>
His
business
has
thriven
;
legacies
have
unexpectedly
dropped
into
his
lap
;
and
,
to
crown
all
,
he
has
made
a
large
fortune
by
a
lucky
speculation
in
South
-
Sea
stock,--made
it
,
too
,
where
so
many
others
have
lost
fortunes
,
your
humble
servant
amongst
the
number
--
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
Sir
,
Mr.
Wood
is
now
in
very
affluent
circumstances
.
<EOS>
He
stuck
to
the
shop
as
long
as
it
was
necessary
,
and
longer
,
in
my
opinion
.
<EOS>
When
he
left
these
premises
,
three
years
ago
,
I
took
them
from
him
;
or
rather
--
to
deal
frankly
with
you,--he
placed
me
in
them
rent
-
free
,
for
,
I
'm
not
ashamed
to
confess
it
,
I
've
had
losses
,
and
heavy
ones
;
and
,
if
it
had
n't
been
for
him
,
I
do
n't
know
where
I
should
have
been
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wood
,
Sir
,
"
he
added
,
with
much
emotion
,
"
is
one
of
the
best
of
men
,
and
would
be
the
happiest
,
were
it
not
that--
"
and
he
hesitated
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sir
?
"
cried
the
other
,
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
His
wife
is
still
living
,
"
returned
Kneebone
,
drily
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
understand
,
"
replied
the
stranger
,
unable
to
repress
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
But
,
it
strikes
me
,
I
've
heard
that
Mrs.
Wood
was
once
a
favourite
of
yours
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
she
was
,
"
replied
the
woollen
-
draper
,
helping
himself
to
an
enormous
pinch
of
snuff
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
does
not
dislike
to
be
rallied
about
his
gallantry,--"so
she
was
.
<EOS>
But
those
days
are
over
--
quite
over
.
<EOS>
Since
her
husband
has
laid
me
under
such
a
weight
of
obligation
,
I
could
n't
,
in
honour
,
continue
--
hem
!
"
<EOS>
and
he
took
another
explanatory
pinch
.
<EOS>
"
Added
to
which
,
she
is
neither
so
young
as
she
was
,
nor
,
is
her
temper
by
any
means
improved
--
hem
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Say
no
more
on
the
subject
,
Sir
,
"
observed
the
stranger
,
gravely
;
"
but
let
us
turn
to
a
more
agreeable
one
--
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
a
far
more
agreeable
one
,
I
must
confess
,
"
returned
Kneebone
,
with
a
self
-
sufficient
smirk
.
 
<EOS>
The
stranger
looked
at
him
as
if
strongly
disposed
to
chastise
his
impertinence
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
she
married
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
,
after
a
brief
pause
.
 
<EOS>
"
Married!--no
--
no
,
"
replied
the
woollen
-
draper
.
"
<EOS>
Winifred
Wood
will
never
marry
,
unless
the
grave
can
give
up
its
dead
.
<EOS>
When
a
mere
child
she
fixed
her
affections
upon
a
youth
named
Thames
Darrell
,
whom
her
father
brought
up
,
and
who
perished
,
it
is
supposed
,
about
nine
years
ago
;
and
she
has
determined
to
remain
faithful
to
his
memory
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
astonish
me
,
"
said
the
stranger
,
in
a
voice
full
of
emotion
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
it
<EOS>
_
is
_
astonishing
,
certainly
,
"
remarked
Kneebone
,
"
to
find
any
woman
constant
--
especially
to
a
girlish
attachment
;
but
such
is
the
case
.
<EOS>
She
has
had
offers
innumerable
;
for
where
wealth
and
beauty
are
combined
,
as
in
her
instance
,
suitors
are
seldom
wanting
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
not
to
be
tempted
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
a
matchless
creature
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
young
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
I
think
,
"
replied
Kneebone
,
again
applying
to
the
snuff
-
box
,
and
by
that
means
escaping
the
angry
glance
levelled
at
him
by
his
companion
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
one
inquiry
more
to
make
of
you
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
stranger
,
as
soon
as
he
had
conquered
his
displeasure
,
"
and
I
will
then
trouble
you
no
further
.
<EOS>
You
spoke
just
now
of
a
youth
whom
Mr.
Wood
brought
up
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
I
recollect
,
there
were
two
.
<EOS>
What
has
become
of
the
other
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
surely
you
do
n't
mean
Jack
Sheppard
?
"
cried
the
woollen
-
draper
in
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
was
the
lad
's
name
,
"
returned
the
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
guessed
from
your
dress
and
manner
,
Sir
,
that
you
must
have
been
long
absent
from
your
own
country
,
"
said
Kneebone
;
"
and
now
I
'm
convinced
of
it
,
or
you
would
n't
have
asked
that
question
.
<EOS>
Jack
Sheppard
is
the
talk
and
terror
of
the
whole
town
.
<EOS>
The
ladies
ca
n't
sleep
in
their
beds
for
him
;
and
as
to
the
men
,
they
dare
n't
go
to
bed
at
all
.
<EOS>
He
's
the
most
daring
and
expert
housebreaker
that
ever
used
a
crow
-
bar
.
<EOS>
He
laughs
at
locks
and
bolts
;
and
the
more
carefully
you
guard
your
premises
from
him
,
the
more
likely
are
you
to
insure
an
attack
.
<EOS>
His
exploits
and
escapes
are
in
every
body
's
mouth
.
<EOS>
He
has
been
lodged
in
every
round
-
house
in
the
metropolis
,
and
has
broken
out
of
them
all
,
and
boasts
that
no
prison
can
hold
him
.
<EOS>
We
shall
see
.
<EOS>
His
skill
has
not
been
tried
.
<EOS>
At
present
,
he
is
under
the
protection
of
Jonathan
Wild
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Does
that
villain
still
maintain
his
power
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
stranger
sternly
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
does
,
"
replied
Kneebone
,
"
and
,
what
is
more
surprising
,
it
seems
to
increase
.
<EOS>
Jonathan
completely
baffles
and
derides
the
ends
of
justice
.
<EOS>
It
is
useless
to
contend
with
him
,
even
with
right
on
your
side
.
<EOS>
Some
years
ago
,
in
1715
,
just
before
the
Rebellion
,
I
was
rash
enough
to
league
myself
with
the
Jacobite
party
,
and
by
Wild
's
machinations
got
clapped
into
Newgate
,
whence
<EOS>
I
was
glad
to
escape
with
my
head
upon
my
shoulders
.
<EOS>
I
charged
the
thief
-
taker
,
as
was
the
fact
,
with
having
robbed
me
,
by
means
of
the
lad
Sheppard
,
whom
he
instigated
to
deed
,
of
the
very
pocket
-
book
he
produced
in
evidence
against
me
;
but
it
was
of
no
avail
--
I
could
n't
obtain
a
hearing
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wood
fared
still
worse
.
<EOS>
Bribed
by
a
certain
Sir
Rowland
Trenchard
,
Jonathan
kidnapped
the
carpenter
's
adopted
son
,
Thames
Darrell
,
and
placed
him
in
the
hands
of
a
Dutch
Skipper
,
with
orders
to
throw
him
overboard
when
he
got
out
to
sea
;
and
though
this
was
proved
as
clear
as
day
,
the
rascal
managed
matters
so
adroitly
,
and
gave
such
a
different
complexion
to
the
whole
affair
,
that
he
came
off
with
flying
colours
.
<EOS>
One
reason
,
perhaps
,
of
his
success
in
this
case
might
be
,
that
having
arrested
his
associate
in
the
dark
transaction
,
Sir
Rowland
Trenchard
,
on
a
charge
of
high
treason
,
he
was
favoured
by
Walpole
,
who
found
his
account
in
retaining
such
an
agent
.
<EOS>
Be
this
as
it
may
,
Jonathan
remained
the
victor
;
and
shortly
afterwards,--at
the
price
of
a
third
of
his
estate
,
it
was
<EOS>
whispered,--he
procured
Trenchard
's
liberation
from
confinement
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
At
the
mention
of
the
latter
occurrence
,
a
dark
cloud
gathered
upon
the
stranger
's
brow
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
anything
further
of
Sir
Rowland
?
"
he
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
more
than
this
,
"
answered
Kneebone,--"that
<EOS>
after
the
failure
of
his
projects
,
and
the
downfall
of
his
party
,
he
retired
to
his
seat
,
Ashton
Hall
,
near
Manchester
,
and
has
remained
there
ever
since
,
entirely
secluded
from
the
world
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
stranger
was
for
a
moment
lost
in
reflection
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
Sir
,
"
he
said
,
preparing
to
take
his
departure
,
"
will
you
add
to
the
obligation
already
conferred
by
informing
me
where
I
can
meet
with
Mr.
Wood
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
With
pleasure
,
"
replied
the
woollen
-
draper
.
"
<EOS>
He
lives
at
Dollis
Hill
,
a
beautiful
spot
near
Willesden
,
about
four
or
five
miles
from
town
,
where
he
has
taken
a
farm
.
<EOS>
If
you
ride
out
there
,
and
the
place
is
well
worth
a
visit
,
for
the
magnificent
view
<EOS>
it
commands
of
some
of
the
finest
country
in
the
neighbourhood
of
London,--you
are
certain
to
meet
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
saw
him
yesterday
,
and
he
told
me
he
should
n't
stir
from
home
for
a
week
to
come
.
<EOS>
He
called
here
on
his
way
back
,
after
he
had
been
to
Bedlam
to
visit
poor
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Jack
's
mother
?
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
young
man
.
"
<EOS>
Gracious
<EOS>
Heaven!--is
she
the
inmate
of
a
mad
-
house
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
,
Sir
,
"
answered
the
woollen
-
draper
,
sadly
,
"
driven
there
by
her
son
's
misconduct
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
that
the
punishment
of
his
offences
should
fall
on
her
head
.
<EOS>
Poor
soul
!
<EOS>
she
nearly
died
when
she
heard
he
had
robbed
his
master
;
and
it
might
have
been
well
if
she
had
done
so
,
for
she
never
afterwards
recovered
her
reason
.
<EOS>
She
rambles
continually
about
Jack
,
and
her
husband
,
and
that
wretch
Jonathan
,
to
whom
,
as
far
as
can
be
gathered
from
her
wild
ravings
,
she
attributes
all
her
misery
.
<EOS>
I
pity
her
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
.
<EOS>
But
,
in
the
midst
of
all
her
affliction
,
she
has
found
a
steady
friend
in
Mr.
Wood
,
who
looks
after
her
comforts
,
and
visits
her
constantly
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
've
heard
him
say
that
,
but
for
his
wife
,
he
would
shelter
her
under
his
own
roof
.
<EOS>
That
,
Sir
,
is
what
I
call
being
a
Good
Samaritan
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
stranger
said
nothing
,
but
hastily
brushed
away
a
tear
.
<EOS>
Perceiving
<EOS>
he
was
about
to
take
leave
,
Kneebone
ventured
to
ask
whom
he
had
had
the
honour
of
addressing
.
 
<EOS>
Before
the
question
could
be
answered
,
a
side
-
door
was
opened
,
and
a
very
handsome
woman
of
Amazonian
proportions
presented
herself
,
and
marched
familiarly
up
to
Mr.
Kneebone
.
<EOS>
She
was
extremely
showily
dressed
,
and
her
large
hooped
petticoat
gave
additional
effect
to
her
lofty
stature
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
she
noticed
the
stranger
,
she
honoured
him
with
an
extremely
impudent
stare
,
and
scarcely
endeavoured
to
disguise
the
admiration
with
which
his
good
looks
impressed
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
perceive
,
my
dear
Mrs.
Maggot
,
that
I
'm
engaged
,
"
said
Kneebone
,
a
little
disconcerted
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
've
you
got
with
you
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
Amazon
,
boldly
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
gentleman
is
a
stranger
to
me
,
Poll
,
"
replied
the
woollen
-
draper
,
with
increased
embarrassment
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
his
name
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
looked
at
the
moment
as
if
he
had
lost
all
desire
to
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
he
's
a
pretty
fellow
at
all
events
,
"
observed
Mrs.
Maggot
,
eyeing
him
from
head
to
heel
with
evident
satisfaction;--"a
devilish
pretty
fellow
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
Poll
,
"
said
Kneebone
,
becoming
very
red
,
"
you
might
have
a
little
more
delicacy
than
to
tell
him
so
before
my
face
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Maggot
,
drawing
up
her
fine
figure
to
its
full
height
;
"
because
I
condescend
to
live
with
you
,
am
I
never
to
look
at
another
man,--especially
at
one
so
much
to
my
taste
as
this
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
think
it
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
retire
,
Madam
,
"
said
the
woollen
-
draper
,
sharply
,
"
if
you
ca
n't
conduct
yourself
with
more
propriety
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Order
those
who
choose
to
obey
you
,
"
rejoined
the
lady
scornfully
.
<EOS>
"
Though
you
lorded
it
over
that
fond
fool
,
Mrs.
Wood
,
you
sha
n't
lord
it
over
me
,
I
can
promise
you
.
<EOS>
That
for
you
!
"
<EOS>
And
she
snapped
her
fingers
in
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
Zounds
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Kneebone
,
furiously
.
<EOS>
"
Go
to
your
own
room
,
woman
,
directly
,
or
I
'll
make
you
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Make
me
!
"
echoed
Mrs.
Maggot
,
bursting
into
a
loud
contemptuous
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
Try
!
"
 
<EOS>
Enraged
at
the
assurance
of
his
mistress
,
the
woollen
-
draper
endeavoured
to
carry
his
threat
into
execution
,
but
all
his
efforts
to
remove
her
were
unavailing
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
after
he
had
given
up
the
point
from
sheer
exhaustion
,
the
Amazon
seized
him
by
the
throat
,
and
pushed
him
backwards
with
such
force
that
he
rolled
over
the
counter
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
she
cried
,
laughing
,
"
that
'll
teach
you
to
lay
hands
upon
me
again
.
<EOS>
You
should
remember
,
before
you
try
your
strength
against
mine
,
that
when
I
rescued
you
from
the
watch
,
and
you
induced
me
to
come
and
live
with
you
,
I
beat
off
four
men
,
any
of
whom
was
a
match
for
you
--
ha
!
ha
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Poll
!
<EOS>
"
said
Kneebone
,
picking
himself
up
,
"
I
entreat
you
to
moderate
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Entreat
a
fiddlestick
!
"
<EOS>
retorted
Mrs.
Maggot
:
"
<EOS>
I
'm
tired
of
you
,
and
will
go
back
to
my
old
lover
,
Jack
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
He
's
worth
a
dozen
of
you
.
<EOS>
Or
,
if
this
good
-
looking
young
fellow
will
only
say
the
word
,
I
'll
go
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
go
,
and
welcome
,
Madam
!
"
<EOS>
rejoined
Kneebone
,
spitefully
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
I
should
think
,
after
the
specimen
you
've
just
given
of
your
amiable
disposition
,
no
person
would
be
likely
to
saddle
himself
with
such
an
incumbrance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
say
you
,
Sir
?
"
said
the
Amazon
,
with
an
engaging
leer
at
the
stranger
.
"
<EOS>
_
You
_
will
find
me
tractable
enough
;
and
,
with
_
me
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
by
,
your
side
you
need
fear
<EOS>
neither
constable
nor
watchman
.
<EOS>
I
've
delivered
Jack
Sheppard
from
many
an
assault
.
<EOS>
I
can
wield
a
quarterstaff
as
well
as
a
prize
-
fighter
,
and
have
beaten
Figg
himself
at
the
broadsword
.
<EOS>
Will
you
take
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
However
tempting
Mrs.
Maggot
's
offer
may
appear
,
the
young
man
thought
fit
to
decline
it
,
and
,
after
a
few
words
of
well
-
merited
compliment
on
her
extraordinary
prowess
,
and
renewed
thanks
to
Mr.
Kneebone
,
he
took
his
departure
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
bye
!
"
cried
Mrs.
Maggot
,
kissing
her
hand
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
find
you
out
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
"
she
added
,
glancing
contemptuously
at
the
woollen
-
draper
,
"
I
'll
go
to
Jack
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
first
go
to
Bridewell
,
you
jade
!
"
rejoined
Kneebone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
,
Tom
,
"
he
added
,
calling
to
a
shop
-
boy
,
"
run
and
fetch
a
constable
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
had
better
bring
half
-
a
-
dozen
,
"
said
the
Amazon
,
taking
up
a
cloth
-
yard
wand
,
and
quietly
seating
herself
;
"
one
wo
n't
do
.
"
 
<EOS>
On
leaving
Mr.
Kneebone
's
house
,
the
young
man
hastened
to
a
hotel
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Covent
Garden
,
where
,
having
procured
a
horse
,
he
shaped
his
course
towards
the
west
end
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
Urging
his
steed
along
Oxford
Road,--as
<EOS>
that
great
approach
to
the
metropolis
was
then
<EOS>
termed,--he
soon
passed
Marylebone
Lane
,
beyond
which
,
with
the
exception
of
a
few
scattered
houses
,
the
country
was
completely
open
on
the
right
,
and
laid
out
in
pleasant
fields
and
gardens
;
nor
did
he
draw
in
the
rein
until
he
arrived
at
Tyburn
-
gate
,
where
,
before
he
turned
off
upon
the
Edgeware
Road
,
he
halted
for
a
moment
,
to
glance
at
the
place
of
execution
.
<EOS>
This
"
fatal
retreat
for
the
unfortunate
brave
"
was
marked
by
a
low
wooden
railing
,
within
which
stood
the
triple
tree
.
<EOS>
Opposite
the
gallows
was
an
open
gallery
,
or
scaffolding
,
like
the
stand
at
a
racecourse
,
which
,
on
state
occasions
,
was
crowded
with
spectators
.
<EOS>
Without
the
inclosure
were
reared
several
lofty
gibbets
,
with
their
ghastly
burthens
.
<EOS>
Altogether
,
it
was
a
hideous
and
revolting
sight
.
<EOS>
Influenced
,
probably
,
by
what
he
had
heard
from
Mr.
Kneebone
,
respecting
the
lawless
career
of
Jack
Sheppard
,
and
struck
with
the
probable
fate
that
awaited
him
,
the
young
man
,
as
he
contemplated
this
scene
,
fell
into
a
gloomy
reverie
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
thus
musing
,
two
horsemen
rode
past
him
;
and
,
proceeding
to
a
little
distance
,
stopped
likewise
.
<EOS>
One
of
them
was
a
stout
square
-
built
man
,
with
a
singularly
swarthy
complexion
,
and
harsh
forbidding
features
.
<EOS>
He
was
well
mounted
,
as
was
his
companion
;
and
had
pistols
in
his
holsters
,
and
a
hanger
at
his
girdle
.
<EOS>
The
other
individual
,
who
was
a
little
in
advance
,
was
concealed
from
the
stranger
's
view
.
<EOS>
Presently
,
however
,
a
sudden
movement
occurred
,
and
disclosed
his
features
,
which
were
those
of
a
young
man
of
nearly
his
own
age
.
<EOS>
The
dress
of
this
person
was
excessively
showy
,
and
consisted
of
a
scarlet
riding
-
habit
,
lined
and
faced
with
blue
,
and
bedizened
with
broad
gold
lace
,
a
green
silk
-
knit
waistcoat
,
embroidered
with
silver
,
and
decorated
with
a
deep
fringe
,
together
with
a
hat
tricked
out
in
the
same
gaudy
style
.
<EOS>
His
figure
was
slight
,
but
well
-
built
;
and
,
in
stature
he
did
not
exceed
five
feet
four
.
<EOS>
His
complexion
was
pale
;
and
there
was
something
sinister
in
the
expression
of
his
large
black
eyes
.
<EOS>
His
head
was
small
and
bullet
-
shaped
,
and
he
did
not
wear
a
wig
,
but
had
his
sleek
black
hair
cut
off
closely
round
his
temples
.
<EOS>
A
mutual
recognition
took
place
at
the
same
instant
between
the
stranger
and
this
individual
.
<EOS>
Both
started
.
<EOS>
The
latter
seemed
inclined
to
advance
and
address
the
former
;
but
suddenly
changing
his
mind
,
he
shouted
to
his
companion
in
tones
familiar
to
the
stranger
's
ear
;
and
,
striking
spurs
into
his
steed
,
dashed
off
at
full
speed
along
the
Edgeware
Road
.
<EOS>
Impelled
by
a
feeling
,
into
which
we
shall
not
pause
to
inquire
,
the
stranger
started
after
them
;
but
they
were
better
mounted
,
and
soon
distanced
him
.
<EOS>
Remarking
that
they
struck
off
at
a
turning
on
the
left
,
he
took
the
same
road
,
and
soon
found
himself
on
Paddington
-
Green
.
<EOS>
A
row
of
magnificent
,
and
even
then
venerable
,
elms
threw
their
broad
arms
over
this
pleasant
spot
.
<EOS>
From
a
man
,
who
was
standing
beneath
the
shade
of
one
<EOS>
these
noble
trees
,
information
was
obtained
that
the
horsemen
had
ridden
along
the
Harrow
Road
.
<EOS>
With
a
faint
view
of
overtaking
them
the
pursuer
urged
his
steed
to
a
quicker
pace
.
<EOS>
Arrived
at
Westbourne
-
Green
--
then
nothing
more
than
a
common
covered
with
gorse
and
furzebushes
,
and
boasting
only
a
couple
of
cottages
and
an
alehouse
--
he
perceived
through
the
hedges
the
objects
of
his
search
slowly
ascending
the
gentle
hill
that
rises
from
Kensall
-
Green
.
 
<EOS>
By
the
time
he
had
reached
the
summit
of
this
hill
,
he
had
lost
all
trace
of
them
;
and
the
ardour
of
the
chase
having
in
some
measure
subsided
,
he
began
to
reproach
himself
for
his
folly
,
in
having
wandered
--
as
he
conceived
--
so
far
out
of
his
course
.
<EOS>
Before
retracing
his
steps
,
however
,
he
allowed
his
gaze
to
range
over
the
vast
and
beautiful
prospect
spread
out
beneath
him
,
which
is
now
hidden
,
from
the
traveller
's
view
by
the
high
walls
of
the
General
Cemetery
,
and
can
,
consequently
,
only
be
commanded
from
the
interior
of
that
attractive
place
of
burial,--and
which
,
before
it
was
intersected
by
canals
and
railroads
,
and
portioned
out
into
hippodromes
,
was
exquisite
indeed
.
<EOS>
After
feasting
his
eye
upon
this
superb
panorama
,
he
was
about
to
return
,
when
he
ascertained
from
a
farmer
that
his
nearest
road
to
Willesden
would
be
down
a
lane
a
little
further
on
,
to
the
right
.
<EOS>
Following
this
direction
,
he
opened
a
gate
,
and
struck
into
one
of
the
most
beautiful
green
lanes
imaginable
;
which
,
after
various
windings
,
conducted
him
into
a
more
frequented
road
,
and
eventually
brought
him
to
the
place
he
sought
.
<EOS>
Glancing
at
the
finger
-
post
over
the
cage
,
which
has
been
described
as
situated
at
the
outskirts
of
the
village
,
and
seeing
no
directions
to
Dollis
Hill
,
he
made
fresh
inquiries
as
to
where
it
lay
,
from
an
elderly
man
,
who
was
standing
with
another
countryman
near
the
little
prison
.
 
<EOS>
"
Whose
house
do
you
want
,
master
?
"
said
the
man
,
touching
his
hat
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Wood
's
,
"
was
the
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
Dollis
Hill
,
"
said
the
man
,
pointing
to
a
well
-
wooded
eminence
about
a
mile
distant
,
"
and
there
,
"
he
added
,
indicating
the
roof
of
a
house
just
visible
above
a
grove
of
trees
"
is
Mr.
Wood
's
.
<EOS>
If
you
ride
past
the
church
,
and
mount
the
hill
,
you
'll
come
to
Neasdon
<EOS>
and
then
you
'll
not
have
above
half
a
mile
to
go
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
young
man
thanked
his
informant
,
and
was
about
to
follow
his
instructions
,
when
the
other
called
after
him----
 
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
master
,
did
you
ever
hear
tell
of
Mr.
Wood
's
famous
'
prentice
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
apprentice
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
stranger
,
in
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Jack
Sheppard
,
the
notorious
house
-
breaker,--him
<EOS>
as
has
robbed
half
Lunnun
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
Sir
,
when
he
was
a
lad
,
the
day
after
he
broke
into
his
master
's
house
in
Wych
Street
,
he
picked
a
gentleman
's
pocket
in
our
church
,
during
sarvice
time,--that
he
did
,
the
heathen
.
<EOS>
The
gentleman
catched
him
<EOS>
i
'
th
'
fact
,
<EOS>
and
we
shut
him
up
for
safety
<EOS>
i
'
that
pris'n
.
<EOS>
But
,
"
said
the
fellow
,
with
a
laugh
,
"
he
soon
contrived
to
make
his
way
out
on
it
,
though
.
<EOS>
Ever
since
he
's
become
so
famous
,
the
folks
about
here
ha
'
christened
it
Jack
Sheppard
's
cage
.
<EOS>
His
mother
used
to
live
i
'
this
village
,
just
down
yonder
;
but
when
her
son
took
to
bad
ways
,
she
went
distracted,--and
<EOS>
now
she
's
i
<EOS>
'
Bedlam
,
I
've
heerd
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
tell
e'e
what
,
John
Dump
,
"
said
the
other
fellow
,
who
had
hitherto
preserved
silence
,
"
I
do
n't
know
whether
you
talkin
'
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
Jack
Sheppard
has
put
him
into
my
head
or
not
;
but
I
once
had
him
pointed
out
to
me
,
and
if
that
_
were
_
him
as
I
seed
then
,
he
's
just
now
ridden
past
us
,
and
put
up
at
the
Six
Bells
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
deuce
he
has
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Dump
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
were
sure
o
'
that
we
might
seize
him
,
and
get
the
reward
for
his
apprehension
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
'
ud
be
no
such
easy
matter
,
"
replied
the
countryman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Jack
's
a
desperate
fellow
,
and
is
always
well
armed
;
besides
,
he
has
a
comrade
with
him
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
tell
e'e
what
we
_
might
_
do----
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
young
man
heard
no
more
.
<EOS>
Taking
the
direction
pointed
out
,
he
rode
off
.
<EOS>
As
he
passed
the
Six
Bells
,
he
noticed
the
steeds
of
the
two
horsemen
at
the
door
;
and
glancing
into
the
house
,
perceived
the
younger
of
the
two
in
the
passage
.
<EOS>
The
latter
no
sooner
beheld
him
than
he
dashed
hastily
into
an
adjoining
room
.
<EOS>
After
debating
with
himself
whether
he
should
further
seek
an
interview
,
which
,
though
,
now
in
his
power
,
was
so
sedulously
shunned
by
the
other
party
,
he
decided
in
the
negative
;
and
contenting
himself
with
writing
upon
a
slip
of
paper
<EOS>
the
hasty
words,--"You
are
known
by
the
villagers,--be
upon
your
guard,"--he
<EOS>
gave
it
to
the
ostler
,
with
instructions
to
deliver
it
instantly
to
the
owner
of
the
horse
he
pointed
out
,
and
pursued
his
course
.
 
<EOS>
Passing
the
old
rectory
,
and
still
older
church
,
with
its
reverend
screen
of
trees
,
and
slowly
ascending
a
hill
side
,
<EOS>
from
whence
he
obtained
enchanting
peeps
of
the
spire
and
college
of
Harrow
,
he
reached
the
cluster
of
well
-
built
houses
which
constitute
the
village
of
Neasdon
.
<EOS>
From
this
spot
a
road
,
more
resembling
the
drive
through
a
park
than
a
public
thoroughfare
,
led
him
gradually
to
the
brow
of
Dollis
Hill
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
serene
and
charming
evening
,
and
twilight
was
gently
stealing
over
the
face
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
Bordered
by
fine
timber
,
the
road
occasionally
offered
glimpses
of
a
lovely
valley
,
until
a
wider
opening
gave
a
full
view
of
a
delightful
and
varied
prospect
.
<EOS>
On
the
left
lay
the
heights
of
Hampstead
,
studded
with
villas
,
while
farther
off
a
hazy
cloud
marked
the
position
of
the
metropolis
.
<EOS>
The
stranger
concluded
he
could
not
be
far
from
his
destination
,
and
a
turn
in
the
road
showed
him
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Beneath
two
tall
elms
,
whose
boughs
completely
overshadowed
the
roof
,
stood
Mr.
Wood
's
dwelling,--a
plain
,
substantial
,
commodious
farm
-
house
.
<EOS>
On
a
bench
at
the
foot
of
the
trees
,
with
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
,
and
a
tankard
by
his
side
,
sat
the
worthy
carpenter
,
looking
the
picture
of
good
-
heartedness
and
benevolence
.
<EOS>
The
progress
of
time
was
marked
in
Mr.
Wood
by
increased
corpulence
and
decreased
powers
of
vision,--by
deeper
wrinkles
and
higher
shoulders
,
by
scantier
breath
and
a
fuller
habit
.
<EOS>
Still
he
looked
hale
and
hearty
,
and
the
country
life
he
led
had
imparted
a
ruddier
glow
to
his
cheek
.
<EOS>
Around
him
were
all
the
evidences
of
plenty
.
<EOS>
A
world
of
haystacks
,
bean
-
stacks
,
and
straw
-
ricks
flanked
the
granges
adjoining
his
habitation
;
the
yard
was
crowded
with
poultry
,
pigeons
were
feeding
at
his
feet
,
cattle
were
being
driven
towards
the
stall
<EOS>
,
horses
led
to
the
stable
,
a
large
mastiff
was
rattling
his
chain
,
and
stalking
majestically
in
front
of
his
kennel
,
while
a
number
of
farming
-
men
were
passing
and
repassing
about
their
various
occupations
.
<EOS>
At
the
back
of
the
house
,
on
a
bank
,
rose
an
old
-
fashioned
terrace
-
garden
,
full
of
apple
-
trees
and
other
fruit
-
trees
in
blossom
,
and
lively
with
the
delicious
verdure
of
early
spring
.
 
<EOS>
Hearing
the
approach
of
the
rider
,
Mr.
Wood
turned
to
look
at
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
getting
dusk
,
and
he
could
only
imperfectly
distinguish
the
features
and
figure
of
the
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
need
not
ask
whether
this
is
Mr.
Wood
's
,
"
said
the
latter
,
"
since
I
find
him
at
his
own
gate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
worthy
carpenter
,
rising
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
Owen
Wood
,
at
your
service
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
remember
me
,
I
dare
say
,
"
observed
the
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
say
I
do
,
"
replied
Wood
.
<EOS>
"
Your
voice
seems
familiar
to
me
--
and
--
but
I
'm
getting
a
little
deaf
--
and
my
eyes
do
n't
serve
me
quite
so
well
as
they
used
to
do
,
especially
by
this
light
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
,
"
returned
the
stranger
,
dismounting
;
"
you
'll
recollect
me
by
and
by
<EOS>
,
I
've
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
I
bring
you
tidings
of
an
old
friend
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
're
heartily
welcome
,
Sir
,
whoever
you
are
.
<EOS>
Pray
,
walk
in
.
<EOS>
Here
,
Jem
,
take
the
gentleman
's
horse
to
the
stable
--
see
him
dressed
and
fed
directly
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Sir
,
will
you
please
to
follow
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Wood
then
led
the
way
up
a
rather
high
and
,
according
to
modern
notions
,
incommodious
flight
of
steps
,
and
introduced
his
guest
to
a
neat
parlour
,
the
windows
of
which
were
darkened
by
pots
of
flowers
and
creepers
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
light
in
the
room
;
but
,
notwithstanding
this
,
the
young
man
did
not
fail
to
detect
the
buxom
figure
of
Mrs.
Wood
,
now
more
buxom
and
more
gorgeously
arrayed
than
ever,--as
<EOS>
well
as
a
young
and
beautiful
female
,
in
whom
he
was
at
no
loss
to
recognise
the
carpenter
's
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
Winifred
Wood
was
now
in
her
twentieth
year
.
<EOS>
Her
features
were
still
slightly
marked
by
the
disorder
alluded
to
in
the
description
of
her
as
a
child,--but
<EOS>
that
was
the
only
drawback
to
her
beauty
.
<EOS>
Their
expression
was
so
amiable
,
that
it
would
have
redeemed
a
countenance
a
thousand
times
plainer
than
hers
.
<EOS>
Her
figure
was
perfect,--tall
,
graceful
,
rounded,--and
,
then
,
she
had
deep
liquid
blue
eyes
,
that
rivalled
the
stars
in
lustre
.
<EOS>
On
the
stranger
's
appearance
,
she
was
seated
near
the
window
busily
occupied
with
her
needle
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
wife
and
daughter
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
carpenter
,
introducing
them
to
his
guest
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wood
,
whose
admiration
for
masculine
beauty
was
by
no
means
abated
,
glanced
at
the
well
-
proportioned
figure
of
the
young
man
,
and
made
him
a
very
civil
salutation
.
<EOS>
Winifred
's
reception
was
kind
,
but
more
distant
,
and
after
the
slight
ceremonial
she
resumed
her
occupation
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
gentleman
brings
us
tidings
of
an
old
friend
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
carpenter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
And
who
may
that
be
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
"
One
whom
you
may
perhaps
have
forgotten
,
"
replied
the
stranger
,
"
but
who
can
never
forget
the
kindness
he
experienced
at
your
hands
,
or
at
those
of
your
excellent
husband
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
the
sound
of
his
voice
every
vestige
of
colour
fled
from
Winifred
's
cheeks
,
and
the
work
upon
which
she
was
engaged
fell
from
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
token
to
deliver
to
you
,
"
continued
the
stranger
,
addressing
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
me
?
"
gasped
Winifred
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
locket
,
"
he
said
,
taking
a
little
ornament
attached
to
a
black
ribband
from
his
breast
,
and
giving
it
her,--"do
<EOS>
you
remember
it
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
--
I
do
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Winifred
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
all
this
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Wood
in
amazement
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
not
know
me
,
father
?
"
said
the
young
man
,
advancing
towards
him
,
and
warmly
grasping
his
hand
.
"
<EOS>
Have
nine
years
so
changed
me
,
that
there
is
no
trace
left
of
your
adopted
son
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
God
bless
me
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
the
carpenter
,
rubbing
his
eyes
,
"
can
--
can
it
be
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Surely
,
"
screamed
Mrs.
Wood
,
joining
the
group
,
"
it
is
n't
Thames
Darrell
come
to
life
again
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
--
it
is
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Winifred
,
rushing
towards
him
,
and
flinging
her
arms
round
his
neck,--"it
<EOS>
is
my
dear
--
dear
brother
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
this
is
what
I
never
expected
to
see
,
"
said
the
carpenter
,
wiping
his
eyes
;
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
'm
not
dreaming
!
<EOS>
Thames
,
my
dear
boy
,
as
soon
as
Winny
has
done
with
you
,
let
me
embrace
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
turn
comes
before
yours
,
Sir
,
"
interposed
his
better
half
.
<EOS>
"
Come
to
my
arms
,
Thames
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
dear
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
dear
!
"
 
<EOS>
To
repeat
the
questions
and
congratulations
which
now
ensued
,
or
describe
the
extravagant
joy
of
the
carpenter
,
who
,
after
he
had
hugged
his
adopted
son
to
his
breast
with
such
warmth
as
almost
to
squeeze
the
breath
from
his
body
,
capered
around
the
room
,
threw
his
wig
into
the
empty
fire
-
grate
,
and
committed
various
other
fantastic
actions
,
in
order
to
get
rid
of
his
superfluous
satisfaction
--
to
describe
the
scarcely
less
extravagant
raptures
of
his
spouse
,
or
the
more
subdued
,
but
not
less
heartfelt
delight
of
Winifred
,
would
be
a
needless
task
,
as
it
must
occur
to
every
one
's
imagination
.
<EOS>
Supper
was
quickly
served
;
the
oldest
bottle
of
wine
was
brought
from
the
cellar
;
the
strongest
barrel
of
ale
was
tapped
;
but
not
one
of
the
party
could
eat
or
drink
--
their
hearts
were
too
full
.
 
<EOS>
Thames
sat
with
Winifred
's
hand
clasped
in
his
own
,
and
commenced
a
recital
of
his
adventures
,
which
may
be
briefly
told
.
<EOS>
Carried
out
to
sea
by
Van
Galgebrok
,
and
thrown
overboard
,
while
struggling
with
the
waves
,
he
had
been
picked
up
by
a
French
fishing
-
boat
,
and
carried
to
Ostend
.
<EOS>
After
encountering
various
hardships
and
privations
for
a
long
time
,
during
which
he
had
no
means
of
communicating
with
England
,
he
,
at
length
,
found
his
way
to
Paris
,
where
he
was
taken
notice
of
by
Cardinal
Dubois
,
who
employed
him
as
one
of
his
secretaries
,
and
subsequently
advanced
to
the
service
of
Philip
of
Orleans
,
from
whom
he
received
a
commission
.
<EOS>
On
the
death
of
his
royal
patron
,
he
resolved
to
return
to
his
own
country
;
and
,
after
various
delays
,
which
had
postponed
it
to
the
present
time
,
he
had
succeeded
in
accomplishing
his
object
.
 
<EOS>
Winifred
listened
to
his
narration
with
the
profoundest
attention
;
and
,
when
it
concluded
,
her
tearful
eye
and
throbbing
bosom
told
how
deeply
her
feelings
had
been
interested
.
 
<EOS>
The
discourse
,
then
,
turned
to
Darrell
's
old
playmate
,
Jack
Sheppard
;
and
Mr.
Wood
,
in
deploring
his
wild
career
,
adverted
to
the
melancholy
condition
to
which
it
had
reduced
his
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
my
part
,
it
's
only
what
I
expected
of
him
,
"
observed
Mrs.
Wood
,
"
and
I
'm
sorry
and
surprised
he
has
n't
swung
for
his
crimes
before
this
.
<EOS>
The
gallows
has
groaned
for
him
for
years
.
<EOS>
As
to
his
mother
,
I
've
no
pity
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
deserves
what
has
befallen
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Dear
mother
,
do
n't
say
so
,
"
returned
Winifred
.
<EOS>
"
One
of
the
consequences
of
criminal
conduct
,
is
the
shame
and
disgrace
which
--
worse
than
any
punishment
the
evil
-
doer
can
suffer
--
is
brought
by
it
upon
the
innocent
relatives
;
and
,
if
Jack
had
considered
this
,
perhaps
he
would
not
have
acted
as
he
has
done
,
and
have
entailed
so
much
misery
on
his
unhappy
parent
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
always
detested
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
"
cried
the
carpenter
's
wife
bitterly
;
"
and
,
I
repeat
,
<EOS>
Bedlam
's
too
good
for
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
observed
Wood
,
"
you
should
be
more
charitable--
<EOS>
"
 
"
Charitable
!
"
repeated
his
wife
,
"
that
's
your
constant
cry
.
<EOS>
Marry
,
come
up
!
<EOS>
I
've
been
a
great
deal
too
charitable
.
<EOS>
Here
's
Winny
always
urging
you
to
go
and
visit
Mrs.
Sheppard
in
the
asylum
,
and
take
her
this
,
and
send
her
<EOS>
that;--and
<EOS>
I
've
never
prevented
you
,
though
such
mistaken
liberality
's
enough
to
provoke
a
saint
.
<EOS>
And
,
then
,
forsooth
,
she
must
needs
prevent
your
hanging
Jack
Sheppard
after
the
robbery
in
Wych
Street
,
when
you
might
have
done
so
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
'll
call
that
charity
:
<EOS>
_
I
<EOS>
_
call
it
defeating
the
ends
of
justice
.
<EOS>
See
what
a
horrible
rascal
you
've
let
loose
upon
the
world
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
,
mother
,
"
rejoined
Winifred
,
"
if
any
one
was
likely
to
feel
resentment
,
I
was
;
for
no
one
could
be
more
frightened
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
sorry
for
poor
Jack
--
as
I
am
still
,
and
hoped
he
would
mend
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mend
!
"
echoed
Mrs.
Wood
,
contemptuously
,
"
he
'll
never
mend
till
he
comes
to
Tyburn
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
At
least
,
I
will
hope
so
,
"
returned
Winifred
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
as
I
was
saying
,
I
was
most
dreadfully
frightened
on
the
night
of
the
robbery
!
<EOS>
Though
so
young
at
the
time
,
I
remember
every
circumstance
distinctly
.
<EOS>
I
was
sitting
up
,
lamenting
your
departure
,
dear
Thames
,
when
,
hearing
an
odd
noise
,
I
went
to
the
landing
,
and
,
by
the
light
of
a
dark
lantern
,
saw
Jack
Sheppard
,
stealing
up
stairs
,
followed
by
two
men
with
crape
on
their
faces
.
<EOS>
I
'm
ashamed
to
say
that
I
was
too
much
terrified
to
scream
out
--
but
ran
and
hid
myself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hold
your
tongue
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs.
Wood
.
<EOS>
"
I
declare
you
throw
me
into
an
ague
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
_
<EOS>
I
_
forget
it
?
<EOS>
Did
n't
they
help
themselves
to
all
the
plate
and
the
money
--
to
several
of
my
best
dresses
,
and
amongst
others
,
to
my
favourite
kincob
gown
;
and
I
've
never
been
able
to
get
another
like
it
!
<EOS>
Marry
,
come
up
!
<EOS>
I
'd
hang
'em
all
,
if
I
could
.
<EOS>
Were
such
a
thing
to
happen
again
,
I
'd
never
let
Mr.
Wood
rest
till
he
brought
the
villains
to
justice
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
such
a
thing
never
_
will
_
happen
again
,
my
dear
,
"
observed
Wood
,
mildly
,
"
<EOS>
but
,
when
it
does
,
it
will
be
time
to
consider
what
course
we
ought
to
pursue
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Let
them
attempt
it
,
if
they
dare
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs.
Wood
,
who
had
worked
herself
into
a
passion
;
"
and
,
I
'll
warrant
'em
,
<EOS>
the
boldest
robber
among
'em
shall
repent
it
,
if
he
comes
across
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
,
my
dear
,
"
acquiesced
the
carpenter
,
"
no
doubt
.
"
 
<EOS>
Thames
,
who
had
been
more
than
once
on
the
point
of
mentioning
his
accidental
rencounter
with
Jack
Sheppard
,
not
being
altogether
without
apprehension
,
from
the
fact
of
his
being
in
the
neighbourhood,--now
judged
it
more
prudent
to
say
nothing
on
the
subject
,
from
a
fear
of
increasing
Mrs.
Wood
's
displeasure
;
and
he
was
the
more
readily
induced
to
do
this
,
as
the
conversation
began
to
turn
upon
his
own
affairs
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wood
could
give
him
no
further
information
respecting
Sir
Rowland
Trenchard
than
what
he
had
obtained
from
Kneebone
;
but
begged
him
to
defer
the
further
consideration
of
the
line
of
conduct
he
meant
to
pursue
until
the
morrow
,
when
he
hoped
to
have
a
plan
to
lay
before
him
,
of
which
he
would
approve
.
 
<EOS>
The
night
was
now
advancing
,
and
the
party
began
to
think
of
separating
.
<EOS>
As
Mrs.
Wood
,
who
had
recovered
her
good
humour
,
quitted
the
room
she
bestowed
a
hearty
embrace
on
Thames
,
and
she
told
him
laughingly
,
that
she
would
"
defer
all
_
she
_
had
to
propose
to
him
until
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
!
<EOS>
She
never
beheld
it
.
 
<EOS>
After
an
affectionate
parting
with
Winifred
,
Thames
was
conducted
by
the
carpenter
to
his
sleeping
apartment
--
a
comfortable
cosy
chamber
;
such
a
one
,
in
short
,
as
can
only
be
met
with
in
the
country
,
with
its
dimity
-
curtained
bed
,
its
sheets
fragrant
of
lavender
,
its
clean
white
furniture
,
and
an
atmosphere
breathing
of
freshness
.
<EOS>
Left
to
himself
,
he
took
a
survey
of
the
room
,
and
his
heart
leaped
as
he
beheld
over
the
,
chimney
-
piece
,
a
portrait
of
himself
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
copy
of
the
pencil
sketch
taken
of
him
nine
years
ago
by
Winifred
,
and
awakened
a
thousand
tender
recollections
.
 
<EOS>
When
about
to
retire
to
rest
,
the
rencounter
with
Jack
Sheppard
again
recurred
to
him
,
and
he
half
blamed
himself
for
not
acquainting
Mr.
Wood
with
the
circumstances
,
and
putting
him
upon
his
guard
against
the
possibility
of
an
attack
.
<EOS>
On
weighing
the
matter
over
,
he
grew
so
uneasy
that
he
resolved
to
descend
,
and
inform
him
of
his
misgivings
.
<EOS>
But
,
when
he
got
to
the
door
with
this
intention
,
he
became
ashamed
of
his
fears
;
and
feeling
convinced
that
Jack
--
bad
as
he
might
be
--
was
not
capable
of
such
atrocious
conduct
as
to
plunder
his
benefactor
twice
,
he
contented
himself
with
looking
to
the
priming
of
his
pistols
,
and
placing
them
near
him
,
to
be
ready
in
case
of
need
,
he
threw
himself
on
the
bed
and
speedily
fell
asleep
.

CHAPTER
II
.
 
<EOS>
The
Burglary
at
Dollis
Hill
.
  
<EOS>
Thames
Darrell
's
fears
were
not
,
however
,
groundless
.
<EOS>
Danger
,
in
the
form
he
apprehended
,
was
lurking
outside
:
nor
was
he
destined
to
enjoy
long
repose
.
<EOS>
On
receiving
the
warning
note
from
the
ostler
,
Jack
Sheppard
and
his
companion
left
Willesden
,
and
taking
--
as
a
blind
--
the
direction
of
Harrow
,
returned
at
night
-
fall
by
a
by
-
lane
to
Neasdon
,
and
put
up
at
a
little
public
-
house
called
the
Spotted
Dog
.
<EOS>
Here
they
remained
till
midnight
when
,
calling
for
their
reckoning
and
their
steeds
,
they
left
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
night
well
-
fitted
to
their
enterprise
,
calm
,
still
,
and
profoundly
dark
.
<EOS>
As
they
passed
beneath
the
thick
trees
that
shade
the
road
to
Dollis
Hill
,
the
gloom
was
almost
impenetrable
.
<EOS>
The
robbers
proceeded
singly
,
and
kept
on
the
grass
skirting
the
road
,
so
that
no
noise
was
made
by
their
horses
'
feet
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
neared
the
house
,
Jack
Sheppard
,
who
led
the
way
,
halted
and
addressed
his
companion
in
a
low
voice:--
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
half
like
this
job
,
Blueskin
,
"
he
said
;
"
it
always
went
against
the
grain
.
<EOS>
But
,
since
I
've
seen
the
friend
and
companion
of
my
childhood
,
Thames
Darrell
,
I
've
no
heart
for
it
.
<EOS>
Shall
we
turn
back
?
<EOS>
"
 
"
And
disappoint
Mr.
Wild
,
Captain
?
"
<EOS>
remonstrated
the
other
,
in
a
deferential
tone
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
this
is
a
pet
project
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
dangerous
to
thwart
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pish
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jack
:
"
I
do
n't
value
his
anger
a
straw
.
<EOS>
All
our
fraternity
are
afraid
of
him
;
but
_
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
_
laugh
at
his
threats
.
<EOS>
He
dare
n't
quarrel
with
me
:
and
if
he
does
,
let
him
look
to
himself
.
<EOS>
I
've
my
own
reasons
for
disliking
this
job
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
you
know
I
always
act
under
your
orders
,
Captain
,
"
returned
Blueskin
;
"
and
if
you
give
the
word
to
retreat
,
I
shall
obey
,
of
course
:
<EOS>
but
I
know
what
Edgeworth
Bess
will
say
when
we
go
home
empty
-
handed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
what
will
she
say
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Sheppard
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
we
were
afraid
,
"
replied
the
other
;
"
but
never
mind
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
;
but
<EOS>
I
do
mind
her
,
"
cried
Jack
upon
whom
his
comrade
's
observation
had
produced
the
desired
effect
.
<EOS>
"
We
'll
do
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
right
,
Captain
,
"
rejoined
Blueskin
.
<EOS>
"
You
pledged
yourself
to
<EOS>
Mr.
Wild--
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
,
"
interrupted
Jack
;
"
and
I
never
yet
broke
an
engagement
.
<EOS>
Though
a
thief
,
Jack
Sheppard
is
a
man
of
his
word
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
he
is
,
"
acquiesced
Blueskin
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
meet
the
man
who
would
dare
to
gainsay
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
One
word
before
we
begin
,
Blueskin
,
"
said
Jack
,
authoritatively
;
"
in
case
the
family
should
be
alarmed
--
mind
,
no
violence
.
<EOS>
There
's
one
person
in
the
house
whom
I
would
n't
frighten
for
the
world
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Wood
's
daughter
,
I
suppose
?
"
observed
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
've
hit
it
,
"
answered
Sheppard
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
say
you
to
carrying
her
off
,
Captain
?
"
suggested
Blueskin
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
've
a
fancy
for
the
girl
,
we
might
do
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
--
no
,
"
laughed
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
Bess
would
n't
bear
a
rival
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
wish
to
do
old
Wood
a
friendly
turn
,
you
may
bring
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
n't
mind
ridding
him
of
her
,
"
said
Blueskin
,
gruffly
;
"
<EOS>
and
if
she
comes
in
my
way
,
may
the
devil
seize
me
if
I
do
n't
make
short
work
with
her
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
forget
,
"
rejoined
Jack
,
sternly
,
"
<EOS>
I
've
just
said
I
'll
have
no
violence
--
<EOS>
mind
that
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
they
dismounted
;
and
fastening
their
horses
to
a
tree
,
proceeded
towards
the
house
.
<EOS>
It
was
still
so
dark
,
that
nothing
could
be
distinguished
except
the
heavy
masses
of
timber
by
which
the
premises
were
surrounded
;
but
as
they
advanced
,
lights
were
visible
in
some
of
the
windows
.
<EOS>
Presently
they
came
to
a
wall
,
on
the
other
side
of
which
the
dog
began
to
bark
violently
;
but
Blueskin
tossed
him
a
piece
of
prepared
meat
,
and
uttering
a
low
growl
,
he
became
silent
.
<EOS>
They
then
clambered
over
a
hedge
,
and
scaling
another
wall
,
got
into
the
garden
at
the
back
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Treading
with
noiseless
step
over
the
soft
mould
,
they
soon
reached
the
building
.
<EOS>
Arrived
there
,
Jack
felt
about
for
a
particular
window
;
and
having
discovered
the
object
of
his
search
,
and
received
the
necessary
implements
from
his
companion
,
he
instantly
commenced
operations
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
seconds
,
the
shutter
flew
open,--then
<EOS>
the
window,--and
<EOS>
they
were
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
Jack
now
carefully
closed
the
shutters
,
while
Blueskin
struck
a
light
,
with
which
he
set
fire
to
a
candle
.
<EOS>
The
room
they
were
in
was
a
sort
of
closet
,
with
the
door
locked
outside
;
but
this
was
only
a
moment
's
obstacle
to
Jack
,
who
with
a
chisel
forced
back
the
bolt
.
<EOS>
The
operation
was
effected
with
so
much
rapidity
and
so
little
noise
,
that
even
if
any
one
had
been
on
the
alert
,
he
could
scarcely
have
detected
it
.
<EOS>
They
then
took
off
their
boots
,
and
crept
stealthily
up
stairs
,
treading
upon
the
point
of
their
toes
so
cautiously
,
that
not
a
board
creaked
beneath
their
weight
.
<EOS>
Pausing
at
each
door
on
the
landing
,
Jack
placed
his
ear
to
the
keyhole
,
and
listened
intently
.
<EOS>
Having
ascertained
by
the
breathing
which
room
Thames
occupied
,
he
speedily
contrived
to
fasten
him
in
.
<EOS>
He
then
tried
the
door
of
Mr.
Wood
's
bed
-
chamber
--
it
was
locked
,
with
the
key
left
in
it
.
<EOS>
This
occasioned
a
little
delay
;
but
Jack
,
whose
skill
as
a
workman
in
the
particular
line
he
had
chosen
was
unequalled
,
and
who
laughed
at
difficulties
,
speedily
cut
out
a
panel
by
means
of
a
centre
-
bit
and
knife
,
took
the
key
from
the
other
side
,
and
unlocked
the
door
.
<EOS>
Covering
his
face
with
a
crape
mask
,
and
taking
the
candle
from
his
associate
,
Jack
entered
the
room
;
and
,
pistol
in
hand
,
stepped
up
to
the
bed
,
and
approached
the
light
to
the
eyes
of
the
sleepers
.
<EOS>
The
loud
noise
proceeding
from
the
couch
proved
that
their
slumbers
were
deep
and
real
;
and
unconscious
of
the
danger
in
which
she
stood
,
Mrs.
Wood
turned
over
to
obtain
a
more
comfortable
position
.
<EOS>
During
this
movement
,
Jack
grasped
the
barrel
of
his
pistol
,
held
in
his
breath
,
and
motioned
to
Blueskin
,
who
bared
a
long
knife
,
to
keep
still
.
<EOS>
The
momentary
alarm
over
<EOS>
,
he
threw
a
piece
of
-
wash
leather
over
a
bureau
,
so
as
to
deaden
the
sound
,
and
instantly
broke
it
open
with
a
small
crow
-
bar
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
filling
his
pockets
with
golden
coin
from
this
store
,
Blueskin
had
pulled
the
plate
-
chest
from
under
the
bed
,
and
having
forced
it
open
,
began
filling
a
canvass
bag
with
its
contents,--silver
coffee
-
pots
,
chocolate
-
dishes
,
waiters
trays
,
tankards
,
goblets
,
and
candlesticks
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
supposed
that
these
articles
,
when
thrust
together
into
the
bag
,
would
have
jingled
;
but
these
skilful
practitioners
managed
matters
so
well
that
no
noise
was
made
.
<EOS>
After
rifling
the
room
of
everything
portable
,
including
some
of
Mrs.
Wood
's
ornaments
and
wearing
apparel
,
they
prepared
to
depart
.
<EOS>
Jack
then
intimated
his
intention
of
visiting
Winifred
's
chamber
,
in
which
several
articles
of
value
were
known
to
be
kept
;
but
as
,
notwithstanding
his
reckless
character
,
he
still
retained
a
feeling
of
respect
for
the
object
of
his
boyish
affections
,
he
would
not
suffer
Blueskin
to
accompany
him
,
so
he
commanded
him
to
keep
watch
over
the
sleepers
--
strictly
enjoining
him
,
however
,
to
do
them
no
injury
.
<EOS>
Again
having
recourse
to
the
centre
-
bit,--for
Winifred
's
door
was
locked,--Jack
had
nearly
cut
out
a
panel
,
when
a
sudden
outcry
was
raised
in
the
carpenter
's
chamber
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
,
a
struggle
was
heard
,
and
Blueskin
appeared
at
the
door
,
followed
by
Mrs.
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
instandly
extinguished
the
light
,
and
called
to
his
comrade
to
come
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
Blueskin
found
it
impossible
to
make
off,--at
least
with
the
spoil,--Mrs
.
<EOS>
Wood
having
laid
hold
of
the
canvass
-
bag
.
 
<EOS>
"
Give
back
the
things
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
,
lady
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Help!--help
,
Mr.
Wood
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Leave
go
!
"
<EOS>
thundered
<EOS>
Blueskin--"leave
go
--
<EOS>
you'd
better!"--and
he
held
the
sack
as
firmly
as
he
could
with
one
hand
,
while
with
the
other
he
searched
for
his
knife
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
wo
n't
leave
go
!
"
screamed
Mrs.
Wood
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Fire!--murder
--
thieves!--I've
got
one
of
'
em
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Come
along
,
"
cried
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
,
"
answered
Blueskin
.
<EOS>
"
This
she
-
devil
has
got
hold
of
the
sack
.
<EOS>
Leave
go
,
I
tell
you
!
"
<EOS>
and
he
forced
open
the
knife
with
his
teeth
.
 
<EOS>
"
Help!--murder!--thieves
!
"
screamed
Mrs.
Wood;--"Owen
--
Owen!--Thames
,
help
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Coming
!
"
cried
Mr.
Wood
,
leaping
from
the
bed
.
<EOS>
"
Where
are
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Here
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Wood
.
<EOS>
"
Help
--
I'll
hold
him
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Leave
her
,
"
cried
Jack
,
darting
down
stairs
,
amid
a
furious
ringing
of
bells,--"the
house
<EOS>
is
alarmed,--follow
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Curses
light
on
you
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Blueskin
,
savagely
;
"
since
you
wo
n't
be
advised
,
take
your
fate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
seizing
her
by
the
hair
,
he
pulled
back
her
head
,
and
drew
the
knife
with
all
his
force
across
her
throat
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
dreadful
stifled
groan
,
and
she
fell
heavily
upon
the
landing
.
 
<EOS>
The
screams
of
the
unfortunate
woman
had
aroused
Thames
from
his
slumbers
.
<EOS>
Snatching
-
up
his
pistols
,
he
rushed
to
the
door
,
but
to
his
horror
found
it
fastened
.
<EOS>
He
heard
the
struggle
on
the
landing
,
the
fall
of
the
heavy
body
,
the
groan,--and
excited
almost
to
frenzy
by
his
fears
,
he
succeeded
in
forcing
open
the
door
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
several
of
the
terrified
domestics
appeared
with
lights
.
<EOS>
A
terrible
spectacle
was
presented
to
the
young
man
's
gaze:--the
floor
deluged
with
blood
--
the
mangled
and
lifeless
body
of
Mrs.
Wood,--Winifred
fainted
in
the
arms
of
a
female
attendant,--and
Wood
standing
beside
them
almost
in
a
state
of
distraction
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
in
a
few
minutes
,
had
this
happy
family
been
plunged
into
the
depths
of
misery
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
a
cry
was
raised
by
a
servant
from
below
,
that
the
robbers
were
flying
through
the
garden
.
<EOS>
Darting
to
a
window
looking
in
that
direction
,
Thames
threw
it
up
,
and
discharged
both
his
pistols
,
but
without
effect
.
<EOS>
In
another
minute
,
the
tramp
of
horses
'
feet
told
that
the
perpetrators
of
the
outrage
had
effected
their
escape
.

CHAPTER
III
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
Sheppard
's
Quarrel
with
Jonathan
Wild
.
  
<EOS>
Scarcely
an
hour
after
the
horrible
occurrence
just
related
,
as
Jonathan
Wild
was
seated
in
the
audience
-
chamber
of
his
residence
at
the
Old
Bailey
,
occupied
,
like
Peachum
,
(
for
whose
portrait
he
sat
,
)
with
his
account
-
books
and
registers
,
he
was
interrupted
by
the
sudden
entrance
of
Quilt
Arnold
,
who
announced
Jack
Sheppard
and
Blueskin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
cried
Wild
,
laying
down
his
pen
and
looking
up
with
a
smile
of
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
just
thinking
of
you
Jack
.
<EOS>
What
news
.
<EOS>
Have
you
done
the
trick
at
Dollis
Hill?--brought
off
the
swag
--
eh
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
answered
Jack
,
flinging
himself
sullenly
into
a
chair
,
"
I
've
not
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
how
's
this
?
"
exclaimed
Jonathan
.
"
<EOS>
Jack
Sheppard
failed
!
<EOS>
I
'd
not
believe
it
,
if
any
one
but
himself
told
me
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I'v
not
failed
,
"
returned
Jack
,
angrily
;
"
but
we
've
done
too
much
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
no
reader
of
riddles
,
"
said
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
Speak
plainly
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Let
this
speak
for
me
,
"
said
Sheppard
,
tossing
a
heavy
bag
of
money
towards
him
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
generally
understand
that
language
.
<EOS>
There
's
more
than
I
undertook
to
bring
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
purchased
by
blood
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
have
you
cut
old
Wood
's
throat
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Wild
,
with
great
unconcern
,
as
he
took
up
the
bag
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
_
had
_
,
you
'd
not
have
seen
me
here
,
"
replied
Jack
,
sullenly
.
<EOS>
"
The
blood
that
has
been
spilt
is
that
of
his
wife
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
her
own
fault
,
"
observed
Blueskin
,
moodily
.
<EOS>
"
She
would
n't
let
me
go
.
<EOS>
I
did
it
in
self
-
defence
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
care
not
why
you
did
it
,
"
said
Jack
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
We
work
together
no
more
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
Captain
,
"
remonstrated
Blueskin
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
'd
have
got
rid
of
your
ill
-
humour
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
You
know
as
well
as
I
do
that
it
was
accident
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Accident
or
not
,
"
rejoined
Sheppard
;
"
you
're
no
longer
pall
of
mine
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
so
this
is
my
reward
for
having
made
you
the
tip
-
top
cracksman
you
are
,
"
muttered
Blueskin;--"to
be
turned
off
at
a
moment
's
notice
,
because
I
silenced
a
noisy
woman
.
<EOS>
It
's
too
hard
.
<EOS>
Think
better
of
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
mind
's
made
up
,
"
rejoined
Jack
,
coldly,--"we
part
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
not
go
,
"
answered
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
I
love
you
like
a
son
,
and
will
follow
you
like
a
dog
.
<EOS>
You
'd
not
know
what
to
do
without
me
,
and
sha
n't
drive
me
off
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
remarked
Jonathan
,
who
had
paid
little
attention
to
the
latter
part
of
the
conversation
:
"
this
is
an
awkward
business
certainly
:
but
we
must
do
the
best
we
can
in
it
.
<EOS>
You
must
keep
out
of
the
way
till
it
's
blown
over
.
<EOS>
I
can
accommodate
you
below
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
require
it
,
"
returned
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
tired
of
the
life
I
'm
leading
.
<EOS>
I
shall
quit
it
and
go
abroad
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
with
you
,
"
said
Blueskin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Before
either
of
you
go
,
you
will
ask
my
permission
,
"
said
Jonathan
,
coolly
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
!
"
exclaimed
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
to
say
you
will
interfere--
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
say
this
,
"
interrupted
Wild
,
with
contemptuous
calmness
,
"
that
I
'll
neither
allow
you
to
leave
England
nor
the
profession
you
've
engaged
in
.
<EOS>
I
would
n't
allow
you
to
be
honest
even
if
you
could
be
so,--which
<EOS>
I
doubt
.
<EOS>
You
are
my
slave
--
and
such
you
shall
continue
.
'
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Slave
?
<EOS>
"
echoed
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dare
to
disobey
<EOS>
,
"
continued
Jonathan
:
"
neglect
my
orders
,
and
I
will
hang
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
Sheppard
started
to
his
feet
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hear
me
,
"
he
cried
,
restraining
himself
with
difficulty
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
time
you
should
know
whom
you
have
to
deal
with
.
<EOS>
Henceforth
,
I
utterly
throw
off
the
yoke
you
have
laid
upon
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
neither
stir
hand
nor
foot
for
you
more
.
<EOS>
Attempt
to
molest
me
,
and
I
split
.
<EOS>
You
are
more
in
my
power
than
I
am
in
yours
.
<EOS>
Jack
Sheppard
is
a
match
for
Jonathan
Wild
,
any
day
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
he
is
,
"
added
Blueskin
,
approvingly
.
 
<EOS>
Jonathan
smiled
contemptuously
.
 
<EOS>
"
One
motive
alone
shall
induce
me
to
go
on
with
you
,
"
said
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
?
"
asked
Wild
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
youth
whom
you
delivered
to
Van
Galgebrok,--Thames
Darrell
,
is
returned
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Impossible
!
"
cried
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
was
thrown
overboard
,
and
perished
at
sea
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
alive
,
"
replied
Jack
,
"
I
have
seen
him
,
and
might
have
conversed
with
him
if
I
had
chosen
.
<EOS>
Now
,
I
know
you
can
restore
him
to
his
rights
,
if
you
choose
.
<EOS>
Do
so
;
and
I
am
yours
as
heretofore
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
"
exclaimed
Jonathan
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
answer
!
"
cried
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
or
no
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
make
no
terms
with
you
,
"
rejoined
Wild
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
defied
me
,
and
shall
feel
my
power
.
<EOS>
You
have
been
useful
to
me
,
or
I
would
not
have
spared
you
thus
long
.
<EOS>
I
swore
to
hang
you
two
years
ago
,
but
I
deferred
my
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Deferred
!
"
echoed
Sheppard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hear
me
out
,
"
said
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
You
came
hither
under
my
protection
,
and
you
shall
depart
freely,--nay
,
more
<EOS>
,
you
shall
have
an
hour
's
grace
.
<EOS>
After
that
time
,
I
shall
place
my
setters
on
your
heels
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
prevent
my
departure
,
"
replied
Jack
,
dauntlessly
,
"
and
therefore
your
offer
is
no
favour
.
<EOS>
But
I
tell
you
in
return
,
I
shall
take
no
pains
to
hide
myself
.
<EOS>
If
you
want
me
,
you
know
where
to
find
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
An
hour
,
"
said
Jonathan
,
looking
at
his
watch,--"remember
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
send
for
me
to
the
Cross
Shovels
in
the
Mint
,
where
I
'm
going
with
Blueskin
,
I
will
surrender
myself
without
resistance
,
"
returned
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
spare
the
officers
a
labour
then
,
"
rejoined
Jonathan
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ca
n't
I
settle
this
business
,
Captain
,
"
muttered
Blueskin
,
drawing
a
pistol
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
harm
him
,
"
said
Jack
,
carelessly
:
"
he
dares
not
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
left
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
Blueskin
,
"
said
Jonathan
,
as
that
worthy
was
about
to
follow
,
"
I
advise
you
to
remain
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
answered
the
ruffian
,
moodily
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
arrest
him
,
you
must
arrest
me
also
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
As
you
will
,
"
said
Jonathan
,
seating
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
and
his
comrade
went
to
the
Mint
,
where
he
was
joined
by
Edgeworth
Bess
,
with
whom
he
sat
down
most
unconcernedly
to
supper
.
<EOS>
His
revelry
,
however
,
was
put
an
end
at
the
expiration
of
the
time
mentioned
by
Jonathan
,
by
the
entrance
of
a
posse
of
constables
with
Quilt
Arnold
and
Abraham
Mendez
at
their
head
.
<EOS>
Jack
,
to
the
surprise
of
all
his
companions
,
at
once
surrendered
himself
:
but
Blueskin
would
have
made
a
fierce
resistance
,
and
attempted
a
rescue
if
he
had
not
been
ordered
by
his
leader
to
desist
.
<EOS>
He
then
made
off
.
<EOS>
Edgeworth
Bess
,
who
passed
for
Sheppard
's
wife
,
was
secured
.
<EOS>
They
were
hurried
before
a
magistrate
,
and
charged
by
Jonathan
Wild
with
various
robberies
;
but
,
as
Jack
Sheppard
stated
that
he
had
most
important
disclosures
to
make
,
as
well
as
charges
to
bring
forward
against
his
accuser
,
he
was
committed
with
his
female
companion
to
the
New
Prison
in
Clerkenwell
for
further
examination
.
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IV
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
Sheppard
's
Escape
from
the
New
Prison
.
  
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
Jack
Sheppard
's
desperate
character
,
it
was
judged
expedient
by
the
keeper
of
the
New
Prison
to
load
him
with
fetters
of
unusual
weight
,
and
to
place
him
in
a
cell
which
,
from
its
strength
and
security
,
was
called
the
Newgate
Ward
.
<EOS>
The
ward
in
which
he
was
confined
,
was
about
six
yards
in
length
,
and
three
in
width
,
and
in
height
,
might
be
about
twelve
feet
.
<EOS>
The
windows
which
were
about
nine
feet
from
the
floor
,
had
no
glass
;
but
were
secured
by
thick
iron
bars
,
and
an
oaken
beam
.
<EOS>
Along
the
floor
ran
an
iron
bar
to
which
Jack
's
chain
was
attached
,
so
that
he
could
move
along
it
from
one
end
of
the
chamber
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
No
prisoner
except
Edgeworth
Bess
was
placed
in
the
same
cell
with
him
.
<EOS>
Jack
was
in
excellent
spirits
;
and
by
his
wit
,
drollery
and
agreeable
demeanour
,
speedily
became
a
great
favourite
with
the
turnkey
,
who
allowed
him
every
indulgence
consistent
with
his
situation
.
<EOS>
The
report
of
his
detention
caused
an
immense
sensation
.
<EOS>
Numberless
charges
were
preferred
against
him
,
amongst
others
,
information
was
lodged
of
the
robbery
at
Dollis
Hill
,
and
murder
of
Mrs.
Wood
,
and
a
large
reward
offered
for
the
apprehension
of
Blueskin
;
and
as
,
in
addition
to
this
,
Jack
had
threatened
to
impeach
Wild
,
his
next
examination
was
looked
forward
to
with
the
greatest
interest
.
 
<EOS>
The
day
before
this
examination
was
appointed
to
take
place
--
the
third
of
the
prisoner
's
detention
--
an
old
man
,
respectably
dressed
,
requested
permission
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
Jack
's
friends
were
allowed
to
visit
him
,
;
but
as
he
had
openly
avowed
his
intention
of
attempting
an
escape
,
their
proceedings
were
narrowly
watched
.
<EOS>
The
old
man
was
conducted
to
Jack
's
cell
by
the
turnkey
,
who
remained
near
him
during
their
interview
.
<EOS>
He
appeared
to
be
a
stranger
to
the
prisoner
,
and
the
sole
motive
of
his
visit
,
curiosity
.
<EOS>
After
a
brief
conversation
,
which
Sheppard
sustained
with
his
accustomed
liveliness
,
the
old
man
turned
to
Bess
and
addressed
a
few
words
of
common
-
place
gallantry
to
her
.
<EOS>
While
this
was
going
on
,
Jack
suddenly
made
a
movement
which
attracted
the
turnkey
's
attention
;
and
during
that
interval
the
old
man
slipped
some
articles
wrapped
in
a
handkerchief
into
Bess
's
hands
,
who
instantly
secreted
them
in
her
bosom
.
<EOS>
The
turnkey
looked
round
the
next
moment
,
but
the
manoeuvre
escaped
his
observation
.
<EOS>
After
a
little
further
discourse
the
old
man
took
his
departure
.
 
<EOS>
Left
alone
with
Edgeworth
Bess
<EOS>
,
Jack
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
of
exultation
.
 
<EOS>
"
Blueskin
's
a
friend
in
need
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
His
disguise
was
capital
;
but
I
detected
it
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Has
he
given
you
the
tools
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
,
"
replied
Bess
,
producing
the
handkerchief
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bravo
,
"
cried
Sheppard
,
examining
its
contents
,
which
proved
to
be
a
file
,
a
chisel
,
two
or
three
gimblets
,
and
a
piercer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Jonathan
Wild
shall
find
it
's
not
easy
to
detain
me
.
<EOS>
As
sure
as
he
is
now
living
,
I
'll
pay
him
a
visit
in
the
Old
Bailey
before
morning
.
<EOS>
And
then
I
'll
pay
off
old
scores
.
<EOS>
It
's
almost
worth
while
being
sent
to
prison
to
have
the
pleasure
of
escaping
.
<EOS>
I
shall
now
be
able
to
test
my
skill
.
"
<EOS>
And
running
on
in
this
way
,
he
carefully
concealed
the
tools
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
the
turnkey
entertained
any
suspicion
of
the
old
man
,
Jack
could
not
tell
,
but
that
night
he
was
more
than
usually
rigorous
in
his
search
;
and
having
carefully
examined
the
prisoners
and
finding
nothing
to
excite
his
suspicions
,
he
departed
tolerably
satisfied
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
was
certain
he
should
be
disturbed
no
more
,
Jack
set
to
work
,
and
with
the
aid
of
the
file
in
less
than
an
hour
had
freed
himself
from
his
fetters
.
<EOS>
With
Bess
's
assistance
he
then
climbed
up
to
the
window
,
which
,
as
has
just
been
stated
,
was
secured
by
iron
bars
of
great
thickness
crossed
by
a
stout
beam
of
oak
.
<EOS>
The
very
sight
of
these
impediments
,
would
have
appalled
a
less
courageous
spirit
than
Sheppard's
--
but
nothing
could
daunt
him
.
<EOS>
To
work
then
he
went
,
and
with
wonderful
industry
filed
off
two
of
the
iron
bars
.
<EOS>
Just
as
he
completed
this
operation
,
the
file
broke
.
<EOS>
The
oaken
beam
,
nine
inches
in
thickness
,
was
now
the
sole
but
most
formidable
obstacle
to
his
flight
.
<EOS>
With
his
gimblet
he
contrived
to
bore
a
number
of
holes
<EOS>
so
close
together
that
at
last
one
end
of
the
bar
,
being
completely
pierced
through
,
yielded
;
and
pursuing
the
same
with
the
other
extremity
,
it
fell
out
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
This
last
operation
was
so
fatiguing
,
that
for
a
short
time
he
was
obliged
to
pause
to
recover
the
use
of
his
fingers
.
<EOS>
He
then
descended
;
and
having
induced
Bess
to
take
off
some
part
of
her
clothing
,
he
tore
the
gown
and
petticoat
into
shreds
and
twisted
them
into
a
sort
of
rope
which
he
fastened
to
the
lower
bars
of
the
window
.
<EOS>
With
some
difficulty
he
contrived
to
raise
her
to
the
window
,
and
with
still
greater
difficulty
to
squeeze
her
through
it
--
her
bulk
being
much
greater
than
his
own
.
<EOS>
He
then
made
a
sort
of
running
noose
,
passed
it
over
her
body
,
and
taking
firmly
hold
of
the
bars
,
prepared
to
guide
her
descent
.
<EOS>
But
Bess
could
scarcely
summon
resolution
enough
to
hazard
the
experiment
;
and
it
was
only
on
Jack
's
urgent
intreaties
,
and
even
threats
,
that
she
could
be
prevailed
on
to
trust
herself
to
the
frail
tenure
of
the
rope
he
had
prepared
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
however
,
she
threw
herself
off
;
and
Jack
carefully
guiding
the
rope
she
landed
in
safety
.
 
<EOS>
The
next
moment
he
was
by
her
side
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
great
point
was
still
unaccomplished
.
<EOS>
They
had
escaped
from
the
New
Prison
,
it
is
true
;
but
the
wall
of
Clerkenwell
Bridewell
,
by
which
that
jail
was
formerly
surrounded
,
and
which
was
more
than
twenty
feet
high
,
and
protected
by
formidable
and
bristling
_
chevaux
de
frise
_
,
remained
to
be
scaled
.
<EOS>
Jack
,
however
,
had
an
expedient
for
mastering
this
difficulty
.
<EOS>
He
ventured
to
the
great
gates
,
and
by
inserting
his
gimblets
into
the
wood
at
intervals
,
so
as
to
form
points
upon
which
he
could
rest
his
foot
,
he
contrived
,
to
ascend
them
;
and
when
at
the
top
,
having
fastened
a
portion
of
his
dress
to
the
spikes
,
he
managed
,
not
without
considerable
risk
,
to
draw
up
his
female
companion
.
<EOS>
Once
over
the
iron
spikes
,
Bess
exhibited
no
reluctance
to
be
let
down
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
.
<EOS>
Having
seen
his
mistress
safe
down
,
Jack
instantly
descended
,
leaving
the
best
part
of
his
clothes
,
as
a
memorial
of
his
flight
,
to
the
jailor
.
 
<EOS>
And
thus
he
effected
his
escape
from
the
New
Prison
.
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
V.
 
<EOS>
The
Disguise
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
hollow
in
the
meadows
behind
the
prison
whence
<EOS>
Jack
Sheppard
had
<EOS>
escaped,--for
,
at
this
time
,
the
whole
of
the
now
thickly
-
peopled
district
north
of
Clerkenwell
Bridewell
was
open
country
,
stretching
out
in
fertile
fields
in
the
direction
of
Islington
--
and
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
,
stood
a
solitary
hovel
,
known
as
Black
Mary
's
Hole
.
<EOS>
This
spot
,
which
still
retains
its
name
,
acquired
the
appellation
from
an
old
crone
who
lived
there
,
and
who
,
in
addition
to
a
very
equivocal
character
for
honesty
,
enjoyed
the
reputation
of
being
a
witch
.
<EOS>
Without
inquiring
into
the
correctness
of
the
latter
part
of
the
story
,
it
may
be
sufficient
to
state
,
that
Black
Mary
was
a
person
in
whom
Jack
Sheppard
thought
he
could
confide
,
and
,
as
Edgeworth
Bess
was
incapable
of
much
further
exertion
,
he
determined
to
leave
her
in
the
old
woman
's
care
till
the
following
night
,
while
he
shifted
for
himself
and
fulfilled
his
design
--
for
,
however
rash
or
hazardous
a
project
might
be
,
if
once
conceived
,
Jack
always
executed
it,--of
visiting
Jonathan
Wild
at
his
house
in
the
Old
Bailey
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
precisely
two
o'clock
on
the
morning
of
Whit
-
monday
,
the
25th
of
May
1724
,
when
the
remarkable
escape
before
detailed
was
completed
:
and
,
though
it
wanted
full
two
hours
to
daybreak
,
the
glimmer
of
a
waning
moon
prevented
it
from
being
totally
dark
.
<EOS>
Casting
a
hasty
glance
,
as
he
was
about
to
turn
an
angle
of
the
wall
,
at
the
great
gates
and
upper
windows
of
the
prison
,
and
perceiving
no
symptoms
of
pursuit
,
Jack
proceeded
towards
the
hovel
at
a
very
deliberate
pace
,
carefully
assisting
his
female
companion
over
every
obstacle
in
the
road
,
and
bearing
her
in
his
arms
when
,
as
was
more
than
once
the
case
,
she
sank
from
fright
and
exhaustion
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
he
crossed
one
or
two
public
gardens
and
a
bowling
-
green,--the
neighbourhood
of
Clerkenwell
then
abounded
in
such
places
of
amusement,--passed
the
noted
Ducking
Pond
,
where
Black
Mary
had
been
frequently
immersed
;
and
,
striking
off
to
the
left
across
the
fields
,
arrived
in
a
few
minutes
at
his
destination
.
 
<EOS>
Descending
the
hollow
,
or
rather
excavation,--for
<EOS>
it
was
an
old
disused
clay
-
pit
,
at
the
bottom
of
which
the
cottage
was
situated,--he
speedily
succeeded
in
arousing
the
ancient
sibyl
,
and
having
committed
Edgeworth
Bess
to
her
care
,
with
a
promise
of
an
abundant
reward
in
case
she
watched
diligently
over
her
safety
,
and
attended
to
her
comforts
till
his
return,--to
all
which
Black
Mary
<EOS>
readily
agreed,--he
departed
with
a
heart
lightened
of
half
its
load
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
's
first
object
was
to
seek
out
Blueskin
,
whom
he
had
no
doubt
he
should
find
at
the
New
Mint
,
at
Wapping
,
for
the
Old
Mint
no
longer
afforded
a
secure
retreat
to
the
robber
;
and
,
with
this
view
,
he
made
the
best
of
his
way
along
a
bye
-
lane
leading
towards
Hockley
-
in
-
the
-
Hole
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
proceeded
far
when
he
was
alarmed
by
the
tramp
of
a
horse
,
which
seemed
to
be
rapidly
approaching
,
and
he
had
scarcely
time
to
leap
the
hedge
and
conceal
himself
behind
a
tree
,
when
a
tall
man
,
enveloped
in
an
ample
cloak
,
with
his
hat
pulled
over
his
brows
,
rode
by
at
full
speed
.
<EOS>
Another
horseman
followed
quickly
at
the
heels
of
the
first
;
but
just
as
he
passed
the
spot
where
Jack
stood
,
his
steed
missed
its
footing
,
and
fell
.
<EOS>
Either
ignorant
of
the
accident
,
or
heedless
of
it
,
the
foremost
horseman
pursued
his
way
without
even
turning
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
Conceiving
the
opportunity
too
favourable
to
be
lost
,
Jack
sprang
suddenly
over
the
hedge
,
and
before
the
man
,
who
was
floundering
on
the
ground
with
one
foot
in
the
stirrup
,
could
extricate
himself
from
his
embarrassing
position
,
secured
his
pistols
,
which
he
drew
from
the
holsters
,
and
held
them
to
his
head
.
<EOS>
The
fellow
swore
lustily
,
in
a
voice
which
Jack
instantly
recognised
as
that
of
Quilt
Arnold
,
and
vainly
attempted
to
rise
and
draw
his
sword
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dog
!
"
thundered
Sheppard
,
putting
the
muzzle
of
the
pistol
so
close
to
the
janizary
's
ear
,
that
the
touch
of
the
cold
iron
made
him
start
,
"
do
n't
you
know
me
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Blood
and
thunder
!
"
exclaimed
Quilt
,
opening
his
eyes
with
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"
It
ca
n't
be
Captain
Sheppard
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
<EOS>
_
is
_
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Jack
;
"
and
you
had
better
have
met
the
devil
on
your
road
than
me
.
<EOS>
Do
you
remember
what
I
said
when
you
took
me
at
the
Mint
four
days
ago
?
<EOS>
I
told
you
my
turn
would
come
.
<EOS>
It
_
has
_
<EOS>
come,--and
sooner
than
you
expected
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
I
find
,
Captain
,
"
rejoined
Quilt
,
submissively
;
"
but
you
're
too
noble
-
hearted
to
take
advantage
of
my
situation
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
acted
for
others
,
and
not
for
myself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
,
"
replied
Sheppard
,
"
and
therefore
I
spare
your
life
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
sure
you
would
n't
injure
me
,
Captain
,
"
remarked
Quilt
,
in
a
wheedling
tone
,
while
he
felt
about
for
his
sword
;
"
you
're
far
too
brave
to
strike
a
fallen
man
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
traitor
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jack
,
who
had
noticed
the
movement
;
"
make
such
another
attempt
,
and
it
shall
cost
you
your
life
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
unbuckled
the
belt
to
which
the
janizary
's
hanger
was
attached
,
and
fastened
it
to
his
own
girdle
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
"
he
continued
,
sternly
,
"
was
it
your
master
who
has
just
ridden
by
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
answered
Quilt
,
sullenly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
,
then
?
"
demanded
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Speak
,
or
I
fire
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
if
you
_
will
_
have
it
,
it
's
Sir
Rowland
Trenchard
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
Rowland
Trenchard
!
<EOS>
"
echoed
Jack
,
in
amazement
.
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
doing
with
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
long
story
,
Captain
,
and
I
've
no
breath
to
tell
it,--unless
<EOS>
you
choose
to
release
me
,
"
rejoined
Quilt
.
 
<EOS>
"
Get
up
,
then
,
"
said
Jack
,
freeing
his
foot
from
the
stirrup
.
<EOS>
"
Now
--
begin
.
"
 
<EOS>
Quilt
,
however
,
seemed
unwilling
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
sorry
to
proceed
to
extremities
,
"
continued
Sheppard
,
again
raising
the
pistol
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
since
you
force
me
to
betray
my
master
's
secrets
,
"
replied
Quilt
,
sullenly
,
"
I
've
ridden
express
to
Manchester
to
deliver
a
message
to
Sir
Rowland
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Respecting
Thames
Darrell
?
"
observed
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
how
the
devil
did
you
happen
to
guess
that
?
"
cried
the
janizary
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
matter
,
"
replied
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
glad
to
find
I
'm
right
.
<EOS>
You
informed
Sir
Rowland
that
Thames
Darrell
was
returned
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Exactly
so
,
"
replied
Quilt
,
"
and
he
instantly
decided
upon
returning
to
London
with
me
.
<EOS>
We
've
ridden
post
all
the
way
,
and
I
'm
horribly
tired
,
or
you
would
n't
have
mastered
me
so
easily
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
not
,
"
replied
Jack
,
to
whom
an
idea
had
suddenly
occurred
.
"
<EOS>
Now
,
Sir
,
I
'll
trouble
you
for
your
coat
.
<EOS>
I
've
left
mine
on
the
spikes
of
the
New
Prison
,
and
must
borrow
yours
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
surely
you
ca
n't
be
in
earnest
,
Captain
.
<EOS>
You
would
n't
rob
Mr.
Wild
's
chief
janizary
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'd
rob
Mr.
Wild
himself
if
I
met
him
,
"
retorted
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
off
with
it
,
sirrah
,
or
I
'll
blow
out
your
brains
,
in
the
first
place
,
and
strip
you
afterwards
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
rather
than
you
should
commit
so
great
<EOS>
a
crime
,
Captain
<EOS>
,
here
it
is
,
"
replied
Quilt
,
handing
him
the
garment
in
question
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Anything
else
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
waistcoat
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
'
Zounds
!
<EOS>
Captain
,
I
shall
get
my
death
of
cold
.
<EOS>
I
was
in
hopes
you
'd
be
content
with
my
hat
and
wig
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
require
them
as
well
,
"
rejoined
Sheppard
;
"
and
your
boots
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
boots
!
<EOS>
Fire
and
fury
!
<EOS>
They
wo
n't
fit
you
;
they
are
too
large
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
how
am
I
to
ride
home
without
them
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
distress
yourself
,
"
returned
Jack
,
"
you
shall
walk
.
<EOS>
Now
,
"
he
added
,
as
his
commands
were
reluctantly
obeyed
,
"
help
me
on
with
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
Quilt
knelt
down
,
as
if
he
meant
to
comply
;
but
,
watching
his
opportunity
,
he
made
a
sudden
grasp
at
Sheppard
's
leg
,
with
the
intention
of
overthrowing
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
Jack
was
too
nimble
for
him
.
<EOS>
Striking
out
his
foot
,
he
knocked
half
a
dozen
teeth
down
the
janizary
's
throat
;
and
,
seconding
the
kick
with
a
blow
on
the
head
from
the
butt
-
end
of
the
pistol
,
stretched
him
,
senseless
and
bleeding
on
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
"
Like
master
like
man
,
"
observed
Jack
as
he
rolled
the
inanimate
body
to
the
side
of
the
road
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
From
Jonathan
Wild
's
confidential
servant
what
could
be
expected
but
treachery
?
"
 
With
this
,
he
proceeded
to
dress
himself
in
Quilt
Arnold
's
clothes
,
pulled
the
wig
over
his
face
and
eyes
so
as
completely
to
conceal
his
features
,
slouched
the
hat
over
his
brows
,
drew
the
huge
boots
above
his
knees
,
and
muffled
himself
up
in
the
best
way
he
could
.
<EOS>
On
searching
the
coat
,
he
found
,
amongst
other
matters
,
a
mask
,
a
key
,
and
a
pocket
-
book
.
<EOS>
The
latter
appeared
to
contain
several
papers
,
which
Jack
carefully
put
by
,
in
the
hope
that
they
might
turn
out
of
importance
in
a
scheme
of
vengeance
which
he
meditated
against
the
thief
-
taker
.
<EOS>
He
then
mounted
the
jaded
hack
,
which
had
long
since
regained
its
legs
,
and
was
quietly
browsing
the
grass
at
the
road
-
side
,
and
,
striking
spurs
into
its
side
,
rode
off
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
proceeded
far
when
he
encountered
Sir
Rowland
,
who
,
having
missed
his
attendant
,
had
returned
to
look
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
has
delayed
you
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
knight
impatiently
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
horse
has
had
a
fall
,
"
replied
Jack
,
assuming
to
perfection
--
<EOS>
for
he
was
a
capital
<EOS>
mimic,--the
tones
of
Quilt
Arnold
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
some
time
before
I
could
get
him
to
move
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
fancied
I
heard
voices
,
"
rejoined
Sir
Rowland
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
did
I
,
"
answered
Jack
;
"
we
had
better
move
on
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
noted
place
for
highwaymen
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
told
me
that
the
rascal
who
has
so
long
been
the
terror
of
the
town
--
Jack
Sheppard
--
was
in
custody
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
he
is
,
"
returned
Jack
;
"
but
there
's
no
saying
how
long
he
may
remain
so
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
there
are
greater
rascals
than
Jack
Sheppard
at
liberty
,
Sir
Rowland
.
"
 
<EOS>
Sir
Rowland
made
no
reply
,
but
angrily
quickened
his
pace
.
<EOS>
The
pair
then
descended
Saffron
-
hill
,
threaded
Field
-
lane
,
and
,
entering
Holborn
,
passed
over
the
little
bridge
which
then
crossed
the
muddy
waters
of
Fleet
-
ditch
,
mounted
Snow
-
hill
,
and
soon
drew
in
the
bridle
before
Jonathan
Wild
's
door
.
<EOS>
Aware
of
Quilt
Arnold
's
mode
of
proceeding
,
Jack
instantly
dismounted
,
and
,
instead
of
knocking
,
opened
the
door
with
the
pass
-
key
.
<EOS>
The
porter
instantly
made
his
appearance
,
and
Sheppard
ordered
him
to
take
care
of
the
horses
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
what
sort
of
journey
have
you
had
,
Quilt
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
man
as
he
hastened
to
assist
Sir
Rowland
to
dismount
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
we
've
lost
no
time
,
as
you
perceive
,
"
replied
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
Is
the
governor
within
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
you
'll
find
him
in
the
audience
-
chamber
.
<EOS>
He
has
got
Blueskin
with
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
indeed
!
<EOS>
what
's
he
doing
here
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
to
buy
off
Jack
Sheppard
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
"
replied
the
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
wo
n't
do
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wild
has
made
up
his
mind
,
and
,
when
that
's
the
case
,
all
the
persuasion
on
earth
wo
n't
turn
him
.
<EOS>
Jack
will
be
tried
to
-
morrow
;
and
,
as
sure
as
my
name
's
Obadiah
Lemon
he
'll
take
up
his
quarters
at
the
King's
-
Head
,
"
pointing
to
Newgate
,
"
over
the
way
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
we
shall
see
,
"
replied
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
Look
to
the
horses
,
Obadiah
.
<EOS>
This
way
,
Sir
Rowland
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
As
familiar
as
Quilt
Arnold
himself
with
every
part
of
Wild
's
mysterious
abode
,
as
well
as
with
the
ways
of
its
inmates
,
Jack
,
without
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
took
up
a
lamp
which
was
burning
in
the
hall
,
and
led
his
companion
up
the
great
stone
stairs
.
<EOS>
Arrived
at
the
audience
-
chamber
,
he
set
down
the
light
upon
a
stand
,
threw
open
the
door
,
and
announced
in
a
loud
voice
,
but
with
the
perfect
intonation
of
the
person
he
represented,--"Sir
Rowland
Trenchard
.
"
 
<EOS>
Jonathan
,
who
was
engaged
in
conversation
with
Blueskin
,
instantly
arose
,
and
bowed
with
cringing
ceremoniousness
to
the
knight
.
<EOS>
The
latter
haughtily
returned
his
salutation
,
and
flung
himself
,
as
if
exhausted
,
into
a
chair
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
've
arrived
sooner
than
I
expected
,
Sir
Rowland
,
"
observed
the
thief
-
taker
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lost
no
time
on
the
road
--
eh!--I
did
n't
expect
you
till
to
-
morrow
at
the
earliest
.
<EOS>
Excuse
me
an
instant
while
I
dismiss
this
person.--You've
your
answer
,
Blueskin
,
"
he
added
,
pushing
that
individual
,
who
seemed
unwilling
to
depart
,
towards
the
door
;
"
it
's
useless
to
urge
the
matter
further
.
<EOS>
Jack
is
registered
in
the
Black
Book
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
One
word
before
I
go
,
"
urged
Blueskin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
a
syllable
,
"
replied
Wild
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
talk
as
long
as
an
Old
Bailey
counsel
,
you
'll
not
alter
my
determination
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
my
life
do
as
well
as
his
?
"
supplicated
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
"
exclaimed
Jonathan
,
doubtfully
.
"
<EOS>
And
you
would
surrender
yourself
--
eh
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
surrender
myself
at
once
,
if
you
'll
engage
to
bring
him
off
;
and
you
'll
get
the
reward
from
old
Wood
.
<EOS>
It
's
two
hundred
pounds
.
<EOS>
Recollect
that
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Faithful
fellow
!
"
<EOS>
murmured
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
I
forgive
him
his
disobedience
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
do
it
?
"
<EOS>
persisted
Blueskin
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Wild
;
"
and
I
've
only
listened
to
your
absurd
proposal
to
see
how
far
your
insane
attachment
to
this
lad
would
carry
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
_
do
_
love
him
,
"
cried
Blueskin
,
"
and
that
's
the
long
and
short
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
've
taught
him
all
he
can
do
;
and
there
is
n't
his
fellow
,
and
never
will
be
again
.
<EOS>
I
've
seen
many
a
clever
cracksman
,
but
never
one
like
him
.
<EOS>
If
you
hang
Jack
Sheppard
,
you
'll
cut
off
the
flower
<EOS>
o
'
the
purfession
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
not
believe
it
of
you
.
<EOS>
It
's
all
very
well
to
read
him
a
lesson
,
and
teach
him
obedience
;
but
you
've
gone
far
enough
for
that
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
quite
,
"
rejoined
the
thief
-
taker
,
significantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
growled
Blueskin
,
"
you
've
had
my
offer
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
my
warning
,
"
retorted
Wild
.
"
<EOS>
Good
night
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Blueskin
,
"
whispered
Jack
,
in
his
natural
tones
,
as
the
other
passed
him
,
"
wait
without
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Power
o
'
mercy
!
"
cried
Blueskin
starting
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Jonathan
,
harshly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nothin'--nothin
'
,
"
returned
Blueskin
;
"
only
I
thought--
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
saw
the
hangman
,
no
doubt
,
"
said
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
Take
courage
,
man
;
it
is
only
Quilt
Arnold
.
<EOS>
Come
,
make
yourself
scarce
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
see
Mr.
Wild
's
busy
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
he
added
,
in
an
under
tone
,
"
Conceal
yourself
outside
,
and
be
within
call
.
"
 
<EOS>
Blueskin
nodded
,
and
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
Jack
affected
to
close
the
door
,
but
left
it
slightly
ajar
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
say
to
him
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Jonathan
,
suspiciously
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
advised
him
not
to
trouble
you
farther
about
Jack
Sheppard
,
"
answered
the
supposed
janizary
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
seems
infatuated
about
the
lad
,
"
observed
Wild
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
obliged
to
hang
him
to
keep
him
company
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
Sir
Rowland
,
"
he
continued
,
turning
to
the
knight
,
"
to
our
own
concerns
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
long
time
since
we
met
,
eight
years
and
more
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
've
enjoyed
your
health
.
'
<EOS>
Slife
!
<EOS>
you
are
wonderfully
altered
.
<EOS>
I
should
scarcely
have
known
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
knight
was
indeed
greatly
changed
.
<EOS>
Though
not
much
passed
the
middle
term
of
life
,
he
seemed
prematurely
stricken
with
old
age
.
<EOS>
His
frame
was
wasted
,
and
slightly
bent
;
his
eyes
were
hollow
,
his
complexion
haggard
,
and
his
beard
,
which
had
remained
unshorn
during
his
hasty
journey
,
was
perfectly
white
.
<EOS>
His
manner
,
however
,
was
as
stern
and
haughty
as
ever
,
and
his
glances
retained
their
accustomed
fire
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
come
hither
to
consult
you
as
to
the
state
of
my
health
,
Sir
,
"
he
observed
,
displeased
by
Jonathan
's
allusion
to
the
alteration
in
his
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
"
True
,
"
replied
Wild
.
<EOS>
"
You
were
no
doubt
surprised
by
the
unlooked
-
for
intelligence
I
sent
you
of
your
nephew
's
return
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Was
it
<EOS>
_
unlooked
-
for
_
<EOS>
on
your
part
?
"
demanded
the
knight
,
distrustfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
On
my
soul
,
yes
,
"
rejoined
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
as
soon
have
expected
the
bones
of
Tom
Sheppard
to
reunite
themselves
and
walk
out
of
that
case
,
as
Thames
Darrell
to
return
.
<EOS>
The
skipper
,
Van
Galgebrok
,
affirmed
to
me,--nay
,
gave
me
the
additional
testimony
of
two
of
his
crew,--that
he
was
thrown
overboard
.
<EOS>
But
it
appears
he
was
picked
up
by
fishermen
,
and
carried
to
France
,
where
he
has
remained
ever
since
,
and
where
it
would
have
been
well
for
him
if
he
had
remained
altogether
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
seen
him
?
"
asked
Trenchard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
,
"
replied
Wild
;
"
and
nothing
but
the
evidence
of
my
senses
would
have
made
me
believe
he
was
living
,
after
the
positive
assurance
I
received
to
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
He
is
at
present
with
Mr.
Wood,--the
person
whom
you
may
remember
adopted
him,--at
Dollis
Hill
,
near
Willesden
;
and
it
's
a
singular
but
fortunate
circumstance
,
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
,
that
Mrs.
Wood
chanced
to
be
murdered
by
Blueskin
,
the
fellow
who
just
left
the
room
,
on
the
very
night
of
his
return
,
as
it
has
thrown
the
house
into
such
confusion
,
and
so
distracted
them
,
that
he
has
had
no
time
as
yet
for
hostile
movements
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
what
course
do
you
propose
to
pursue
in
reference
to
him
?
"
asked
Sir
Rowland
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
plan
is
a
very
simple
one
,
"
rejoined
the
thief
-
taker
smiling
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
treat
him
as
you
treated
his
father
,
Sir
Rowland
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Murder
him
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Trenchard
shuddering
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
murder
him
,
if
you
like
the
term
,
"
returned
Wild
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
call
it
putting
him
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
But
no
matter
how
you
phrase
it
,
the
end
is
the
same
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
consent
to
it
,
"
replied
Sir
Rowland
firmly
.
"
<EOS>
Since
the
sea
has
spared
him
,
I
will
spare
him
.
<EOS>
It
is
in
vain
to
struggle
against
the
arm
of
fate
.
<EOS>
I
will
shed
no
more
blood
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
perish
upon
the
gibbet
,
"
rejoined
Jonathan
contemptuously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Flight
is
still
left
me
,
"
replied
Trenchard
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
escape
to
France
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
do
you
think
I
'll
allow
you
to
depart
,
"
cried
Jonathan
in
a
menacing
tone
,
"
and
compromise
_
<EOS>
my
_
safety
?
<EOS>
No
,
no
.
<EOS>
We
are
linked
together
in
this
matter
,
and
must
go
through
with
it
.
<EOS>
You
cannot
--
shall
not
retreat
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Death
and
hell
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Sir
Rowland
,
rising
and
drawing
his
sword
;
"
do
you
think
you
can
shackle
my
free
will
,
villain
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
this
particular
instance
I
do
,
Sir
Rowland
,
"
replied
Jonathan
,
calmly
,
"
because
you
are
wholly
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
But
be
patient
,
I
am
your
fast
friend
.
<EOS>
Thames
Darrell
MUST
die
.
<EOS>
Our
mutual
safety
requires
it
.
<EOS>
Leave
the
means
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
More
blood
!
<EOS>
more
blood
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Trenchard
,
passing
his
hand
with
agony
across
his
brow
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
I
never
banish
those
horrible
phantoms
from
my
couch
--
the
father
with
his
bleeding
breast
and
dripping
hair!--the
mother
with
her
wringing
hands
and
looks
of
vengeance
and
reproach!--And
<EOS>
must
another
be
added
to
their
number
--
their
son
!
<EOS>
Horror!--let
<EOS>
me
be
spared
this
new
crime
!
<EOS>
And
yet
the
gibbet
--
my
name
tarnished
--
my
escutcheon
blotted
by
the
hangman!--No
,
I
can
not
submit
to
that
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
not
,
"
observed
Jonathan
,
who
had
some
practice
in
the
knight
's
moods
,
and
knew
how
to
humour
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
miserable
weakness
to
be
afraid
of
bloodshed.--The
general
who
gives
an
order
for
wholesale
carnage
never
sleeps
a
wink
the
less
soundly
for
the
midnight
groans
of
his
victims
,
and
we
should
deride
him
as
a
coward
if
he
did
.
<EOS>
And
life
is
much
the
same
,
whether
taken
in
battle
,
on
the
couch
,
or
by
the
road
-
side
.
<EOS>
Besides
those
whom
I
've
slain
with
my
own
hands
,
I
've
brought
upwards
of
thirty
persons
to
the
gallows
.
<EOS>
Most
of
their
relics
are
in
yonder
cases
;
but
I
do
n't
remember
that
any
of
them
have
disturbed
my
rest
.
<EOS>
The
mode
of
destruction
makes
no
difference
.
<EOS>
It
's
precisely
the
same
thing
to
me
to
bid
my
janizaries
cut
Thames
Darrell
's
throat
,
as
to
order
Jack
Sheppard
's
execution
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
Jonathan
said
this
,
Jack
's
hand
involuntarily
sought
a
pistol
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
to
the
point
,
"
continued
Wild
,
unconscious
of
the
peril
in
which
the
remark
had
placed
him,--"to
the
point
.
<EOS>
On
the
terms
that
procured
your
liberation
from
Newgate
,
I
will
free
you
from
this
new
danger
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Those
terms
were
a
third
of
my
estate
,
"
observed
Trenchard
bitterly
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
of
that
,
"
rejoined
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Any
price
was
better
than
your
head
.
<EOS>
If
Thames
Darrell
escapes
,
you
will
lose
both
life
and
property
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
True
,
true
,
"
replied
the
knight
,
with
an
agonized
look
;
"
there
is
no
alternative
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
None
whatever
,
"
rejoined
Wild
.
<EOS>
"
Is
it
a
bargain
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Take
half
of
my
estate
--
take
all
--
my
life
,
if
you
will
--
I
am
weary
of
it
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Trenchard
passionately
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Jonathan
,
"
I
'll
not
take
you
at
your
word
,
as
regards
the
latter
proposition
.
<EOS>
We
shall
both
,
I
hope
,
live
to
enjoy
our
shares
--
long
after
Thames
Darrell
is
forgotten
--
ha
!
ha
!
<EOS>
A
third
of
your
estate
I
accept
.
<EOS>
And
as
these
things
should
always
be
treated
as
matters
of
business
,
I
'll
just
draw
up
a
memorandum
of
our
arrangement
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
as
he
spoke
,
he
took
up
a
sheet
of
paper
,
and
hastily
traced
a
few
lines
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sign
this
,
"
he
said
,
pushing
the
document
towards
Sir
Rowland
.
 
<EOS>
The
knight
mechanically
complied
with
his
request
.
 
<EOS>
"
Enough
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jonathan
,
eagerly
pocketing
the
memorandum
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
in
return
for
your
liberality
,
I
'll
inform
you
of
a
secret
with
which
it
is
important
you
should
be
acquainted
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
secret
!
"
exclaimed
Trenchard
.
<EOS>
"
Concerning
whom
?
"
 
"
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
"
replied
Jonathan
,
mysteriously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Sheppard
!
<EOS>
"
echoed
Jack
,
surprised
out
of
his
caution
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
exclaimed
Wild
,
looking
angrily
towards
his
supposed
attendant
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
beg
pardon
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Jack
,
with
the
accent
and
manner
of
the
janizary
;
"
I
was
betrayed
into
the
exclamation
by
my
surprise
that
anything
in
which
Sir
Rowland
Trenchard
was
interested
could
have
reference
to
so
humble
a
person
as
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Be
pleased
,
then
,
in
future
not
to
let
your
surprise
find
vent
in
words
,
"
rejoined
Jonathan
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
My
servants
,
like
Eastern
mutes
,
must
have
eyes
,
and
ears,--and
<EOS>
_
hands
<EOS>
_
,
if
need
<EOS>
be,--but
<EOS>
no
tongues
.
<EOS>
You
understand
me
,
sirrah
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Perfectly
,
"
replied
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
dumb
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
secret
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Trenchard
,
impatiently
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
need
not
remind
you
,
Sir
Rowland
,
"
replied
Wild
,
"
that
you
had
two
sisters
--
Aliva
and
Constance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Both
are
dead
,
"
observed
the
knight
,
gloomily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
so
;
"
answered
Wild
.
<EOS>
"
Constance
is
yet
living
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Constance
alive
?
<EOS>
Impossible
!
"
ejaculated
Trenchard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
proofs
to
the
contrary
,
"
replied
Jonathan
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
this
is
the
case
,
where
is
she
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
Bedlam
,
"
replied
the
thief
-
taker
,
with
a
Satanic
grin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Gracious
Heaven
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
knight
,
upon
whom
a
light
seemed
suddenly
to
break
.
<EOS>
"
You
mentioned
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
What
has
she
to
with
Constance
Trenchard
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Sheppard
_
is
_
Constance
Trenchard
,
"
replied
Jonathan
,
maliciously
.
 
<EOS>
Here
Jack
Sheppard
was
unable
to
repress
an
exclamation
of
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
"
Again
,
"
cried
Jonathan
,
sternly
:
"
beware
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
<EOS>
vociferated
Trenchard
.
<EOS>
"
My
sister
the
wife
of
one
condemned
felon
!
<EOS>
the
parent
of
another
!
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
_
is
_
<EOS>
so
,
nevertheless
,
"
replied
Wild
.
<EOS>
"
Stolen
by
a
gipsy
when
scarcely
five
years
old
,
Constance
Trenchard
,
after
various
vicissitudes
,
was
carried
to
London
,
where
she
lived
in
great
poverty
,
with
the
dregs
of
society
.
<EOS>
It
is
useless
to
trace
out
her
miserable
career
;
though
I
can
easily
do
so
if
you
require
it
.
<EOS>
To
preserve
herself
,
however
,
from
destitution
,
or
what
she
considered
worse
,
she
wedded
a
journeyman
carpenter
,
named
Sheppard
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
<EOS>
that
one
so
highly
born
should
submit
to
such
a
degradation
?
<EOS>
"
groaned
the
knight
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
nothing
surprising
in
it
,
"
rejoined
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
she
had
no
knowledge
of
her
birth
;
and
,
consequently
,
no
false
pride
to
get
rid
of
.
<EOS>
In
the
second
,
she
was
wretchedly
poor
,
and
assailed
by
temptations
of
which
you
can
form
no
idea
.
<EOS>
Distress
like
hers
might
palliate
far
greater
offences
than
she
ever
committed
.
<EOS>
With
the
same
inducements
we
should
all
do
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
Poor
girl
!
<EOS>
she
was
beautiful
once
;
so
beautiful
as
to
make
<EOS>
_
me
_
,
who
care
little
for
the
allurements
of
women
,
fancy
myself
enamoured
of
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
Jack
Sheppard
again
sought
his
pistol
,
and
was
only
withheld
from
levelling
it
at
the
thief
-
taker
's
head
,
by
the
hope
that
he
might
gather
some
further
information
respecting
his
mother
.
<EOS>
And
he
had
good
reason
before
long
to
congratulate
himself
on
his
forbearance
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
proof
have
you
of
the
truth
of
this
story
?
"
inquired
Trenchard
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
,
"
replied
Jonathan
,
taking
a
paper
from
a
portfolio
,
and
handing
it
to
the
knight
,
"
this
written
evidence
,
signed
by
Martha
Cooper
,
the
gipsy
,
by
whom
the
girl
was
stolen
,
and
who
was
afterwards
executed
for
a
similar
crime
.
<EOS>
It
is
attested
,
you
will
observe
,
by
the
Reverend
Mr.
Purney
,
the
present
ordinary
of
Newgate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
acquainted
with
Mr.
Purney
's
hand
-
writing
,
"
said
Jack
,
advancing
,
"
and
can
at
once
decide
whether
this
is
a
forgery
or
not
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Look
at
it
,
then
,
"
said
Wild
,
giving
him
the
portfolio
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
ordinary
's
signature
,
undoubtedly
,
"
replied
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
he
gave
back
the
portfolio
to
Sir
Rowland
he
contrived
,
unobserved
,
to
slip
the
precious
document
into
his
sleeve
,
and
from
thence
into
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
,
does
any
of
our
bright
blood
flow
in
the
veins
of
a
ruffianly
housebreaker
?
"
cried
Trenchard
,
with
a
look
of
bewilderment
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
not
believe
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Others
may
,
if
you
wo
n't
,
"
muttered
Jack
,
retiring
.
"
<EOS>
Thank
Heaven
!
<EOS>
I
'm
not
basely
born
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
mark
me
,
"
said
Jonathan
,
"
and
you
'll
find
I
do
n't
do
things
by
halves
.
<EOS>
By
your
father
,
Sir
Montacute
Trenchard
's
will
,
you
are
aware,--and
,
therefore
,
I
need
not
repeat
it
,
except
for
<EOS>
the
special
purpose
I
have
in
view,--you
are
aware
,
I
say
,
that
,
by
this
will
,
in
case
your
sister
Aliva
,
died
without
issue
,
or
,
on
the
death
of
such
issue
,
the
property
reverts
to
Constance
and
_
her
_
issue
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hear
,
"
said
Sir
Rowland
,
moodily
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
,
"
muttered
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thames
Darrell
once
destroyed
,
"
pursued
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
Constance
--
or
,
rather
,
Mrs.
Sheppard
--
becomes
entitled
to
the
estates
;
which
eventually
--
provided
he
escaped
the
gallows
--
would
descend
to
her
son
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
"
exclaimed
Jack
,
drawing
in
his
breath
,
and
leaning
forward
with
intense
curiosity
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sir
?
"
gasped
Sir
Rowland
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
this
need
give
you
no
uneasiness
,
"
pursued
Jonathan
;
"
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
as
I
told
you
,
is
in
Bedlam
,
an
incurable
maniac
;
while
her
son
is
in
the
New
Prison
,
whence
he
will
only
be
removed
to
Newgate
and
Tyburn
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
you
think
,
"
muttered
Jack
,
between
his
ground
teeth
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
make
your
mind
perfectly
easy
on
the
score
of
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
"
continued
Jonathan
;
"
after
we
've
disposed
of
Thames
Darrell
,
I
'll
visit
her
in
Bedlam
;
and
,
as
I
understand
I
form
one
of
her
chief
terrors
<EOS>
,
I
'll
give
her
such
a
fright
that
I
'll
engage
she
sha
n't
long
survive
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Devil
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
Jack
,
again
grasping
his
pistol
.
<EOS>
But
,
feeling
secure
of
vengeance
,
he
determined
to
abide
his
time
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
having
got
rid
of
the
minor
obstacles
,
"
said
Jonathan
,
"
I
'll
submit
a
plan
for
the
removal
of
the
main
difficulty
.
<EOS>
Thames
Darrell
,
I
've
said
,
is
at
Mr.
Wood
's
at
Dollis
Hill
,
wholly
unsuspicious
of
any
designs
against
him
,
and
,
in
fact
,
entirely
ignorant
of
your
being
acquainted
with
his
return
,
or
even
of
his
existence
.
<EOS>
In
this
state
,
it
will
be
easy
to
draw
him
into
a
snare
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
night
--
or
rather
to
-
night
,
for
we
are
fast
verging
on
another
day
--
I
propose
to
lure
him
out
of
the
house
by
a
stratagem
which
I
am
sure
will
prove
infallible
;
and
,
then
,
what
so
easy
as
to
knock
him
on
the
head
.
<EOS>
To
make
sure
work
of
it
,
I
'll
superintend
the
job
myself
.
<EOS>
Before
midnight
,
I
'll
answer
for
it
,
it
shall
be
done
.
<EOS>
My
janizaries
shall
go
with
me
.
<EOS>
You
hear
what
I
say
,
Quilt
?
"
he
added
,
looking
at
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
replied
Sheppard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Abraham
Mendez
will
like
the
task,--for
<EOS>
he
has
entertained
a
hatred
to
the
memory
of
Thames
Darrell
ever
since
he
received
the
wound
in
the
head
,
when
the
two
lads
attempted
to
break
out
of
St.
Giles
's
round
-
house
.
<EOS>
I
've
despatched
him
to
the
New
Prison

<EOS>
But
I
expect
him
back
every
minute
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
New
Prison
!
"
exclaimed
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
he
gone
there
for
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
With
a
message
to
the
turnkey
to
look
after
his
prisoner
,
"
replied
Wild
,
with
a
cunning
smile
.
"
<EOS>
Jack
Sheppard
had
a
visitor
,
I
understand
,
yesterday
,
and
may
make
an
attempt
to
escape
.
<EOS>
It
's
as
well
to
be
on
the
safe
side
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
"
replied
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
his
quick
ears
detected
the
sound
of
footsteps
on
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
He
drew
both
his
pistols
,
and
prepared
for
a
desperate
encounter
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
another
mystery
I
would
have
solved
,
"
said
Trenchard
,
addressing
Wild
;
"
you
have
told
me
much
,
but
not
enough
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
require
further
?
"
asked
Jonathan
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
name
and
rank
of
Thames
Darrell
's
father
,
"
said
the
knight
.
 
<EOS>
"
Another
time
,
"
replied
the
thief
-
taker
,
evasively
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
have
it
now
,
"
rejoined
Trenchard
,
"
or
our
agreement
is
void
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
help
yourself
,
Sir
Rowland

"
replied
Jonathan
,
contemptuously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
replied
the
knight
,
drawing
his
sword
,
"
the
secret
,
villain
,
or
I
will
force
it
from
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
Before
Wild
could
make
any
reply
,
the
door
was
thrown
violently
open
,
and
Abraham
Mendez
rushed
into
the
room
,
with
a
face
of
the
utmost
consternation
.
 
<EOS>
"
He

cried
the
Jew

cried
Jonathan
,
stamping
his
foot
with
uncontrollable
rage
.
<EOS>
"
I
'd
rather
have
given
a
thousand
pounds
than

<EOS>
But
he
might
have
broken
out

not

over
the

of
Clerkenwell
Bridewell

<EOS>
Did

"

Abraham
;

<EOS>
Jonathan
gave
utterance
to
a
torrent
of
imprecations
.
 
<EOS>
While
he
thus
vented
his
rage
,
the
door
again
opened
,
and
Quilt
Arnold
rushed
into
the
room
,
bleeding
,
and
half
-
dressed
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Sblood

<EOS>

<EOS>
cried
Jonathan
,
in
the
utmost
surprise
.
"
<EOS>
Quilt
Arnold
,
is
that
you

"
 
<EOS>
"
It

"
sputtered
the
janizary
.
<EOS>
"
I

been
robbed

maltreated

and
nearly
murdered

<EOS>
"
By

exclaimed
the
thief

taker

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
and
I
hope
you
'll
take
ample
vengeance

said
Quilt
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
when

"
rejoined
Wild

<EOS>
"
You

returned
Quilt
;
"
there
he
stands

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
here
I
am

"
said
Jack
,
throwing
off
his
hat
and
wig
,
and
marching
towards
the
group
,
amongst
whom
there
was
a
general
movement
of
surprise
at
his
audacity
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
Rowland
,
I
salute
you
as
your

"
 
<EOS>
"
Back

said
the
knight
,
haughtily
.
<EOS>
"
I
disown

<EOS>
The

is
a

"
 
<EOS>
"
Time
will
show

"
replied
Jack
with
equal
haughtiness
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
however

it
may
turn
out
,
I
disown
_
<EOS>
you
_
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Jack
,
"
said
Jonathan
,
who
had
looked
at
him
with
surprise
not
unmixed
with
admiration
,
"
you
are
a
bold
and
clever
fellow
,
I
must
allow
.
<EOS>
Were
I
not
Jonathan
Wild
,
I
'd
be
Jack
Sheppard

<EOS>
I
'm
almost
sorry

I
've

to
hang
you

<EOS>
But
,
it
ca
n't
be

<EOS>
I
'm
a
slave
to
my
word

<EOS>
Were
I
to
let
you
go

,
you
'd
say
I
feared
you

<EOS>
Besides
,
you

secrets
which
must
not

<EOS>
Nab
and
Quilt

<EOS>
Jack
,
you
are
my
prisoner

"
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
flatter
yourself
<EOS>
you
can
detain
me
?
"
<EOS>
laughed
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
least
I
'll
try
,
"
replied
Jonathan
,
sarcastically
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
be
a
cleverer
lad
than
even
_
<EOS>
I
_
take
you
for
,
if
you
get
out
of
this
place
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
ho
!
<EOS>
Blueskin
!
<EOS>
"
shouted
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
I
am
,
Captain
,
"
cried
a
voice
from
without
.
<EOS>
And
the
door
was
suddenly
thrown
open
,
and
the
two
janizaries
felled
to
the
ground
by
the
strong
arm
of
the
stalwart
robber
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
boast
,
you
see
,
was
a
little
premature
,
Mr.
Wild
,
"
said
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
Adieu
,
my
worthy
uncle
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
,
I
've
secured
the
proof
of
my
birth
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Confusion
!
"
thundered
Wild
.
<EOS>
"
Close
the
doors
below
!
<EOS>
Loose
the
dogs
!
<EOS>
Curses
!
<EOS>
they
do
n't
hear
me
!
<EOS>
I
'll
ring
the
alarm
-
bell
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
raised
his
arm
with
the
intention
of
executing
his
purpose
,
when
a
ball
from
Jack
's
pistol
passed
through
the
back
of
his
hand
,
shattering
the
limb
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Aha
!
<EOS>
my
lad
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
without
appearing
to
regard
the
pain
of
the
wound
;
"
now
I
'll
show
you
no
quarter
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
with
the
uninjured
hand
he
drew
a
pistol
,
which
he
fired
,
but
without
effect
,
at
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fly
,
Captain
,
fly
!
"
<EOS>
vociferated
Blueskin
;
"
I
sha
n't
be
able
to
keep
these
devils
down
.
<EOS>
Fly
!
<EOS>
they
shall
knock
me
on
the
head
--
curse
'
em!--before
<EOS>
they
shall
touch
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Come
along
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jack
,
darting
through
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
key
's
on
the
outside
--
quick
!
<EOS>
quick
!
"
 
<EOS>
Instantly
alive
to
this
chance
,
Blueskin
broke
away
.
<EOS>
Two
shots
were
fired
at
him
by
Jonathan
;
one
of
which
passed
through
his
hat
,
and
the
other
through
the
fleshy
part
of
his
arm
;
but
he
made
good
his
retreat
.
<EOS>
The
door
was
closed
--
<EOS>
locked,--and
the
pair
were
heard
descending
the
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hell
's
curses
!
"
<EOS>
roared
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
They
'll
escape
.
<EOS>
Not
a
moment
is
to
be
lost
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
took
hold
of
a
ring
in
the
floor
,
and
disclosed
a
flight
of
steps
,
down
which
he
hurried
,
followed
by
the
janizaries
.
<EOS>
This
means
of
communication
instantly
brought
them
to
the
lobby
.
<EOS>
But
Jack
and
his
companion
were
already
gone
.
 
<EOS>
Jonathan
threw
open
the
street
-
door
.
<EOS>
Upon
the
pavement
near
the
court
lay
the
porter
,
who
had
been
prostrated
by
a
blow
from
the
butt
-
end
of
a
pistol
.
<EOS>
The
man
,
who
was
just
able
to
move
,
pointed
towards
Giltspur
-
street
.
<EOS>
Jonathan
looked
in
that
direction
,
and
beheld
the
fugitives
riding
off
in
triumph
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
-
night
it
is
_
their
_
turn
,
"
said
Jonathan
,
binding
up
his
wounded
fingers
with
a
handkerchief
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To

morrow
it
will
be
_
mine

CHAPTER
VI
.
 
<EOS>
Winifred
receives
two
Proposals
.
  
<EOS>
The
tragical
affair
at
Dollis
Hill
,
it
need
scarcely
be
said
,
was
a
dreadful
blow
to
the
family
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wood
bore
up
with
great
fortitude
against
the
shock
,
attended
the
inquest
,
delivered
his
evidence
with
composure
,
and
gave
directions
afterwards
for
the
funeral
,
which
took
place
on
the
day
but
one
following
--
Sunday
.
<EOS>
As
soon
,
however
,
as
the
last
solemn
rites
were
over
,
and
the
remains
of
the
unfortunate
woman
committed
to
their
final
resting
-
place
in
Willesden
churchyard
,
his
firmness
completely
deserted
him
,
and
he
sank
beneath
the
weight
of
his
affliction
.
<EOS>
It
was
fortunate
that
by
this
time
Winifred
had
so
far
recovered
,
as
to
be
able
to
afford
her
father
the
best
and
only
solace
that
,
under
the
circumstances
,
he
could
have
received,--her
personal
attentions
.
 
<EOS>
The
necessity
which
had
previously
existed
of
leaving
the
ghastly
evidence
of
the
murderous
deed
undisturbed,--the
presence
of
the
mangled
corpse,--the
bustle
of
the
inquest
,
at
which
her
attendance
was
required,--all
these
circumstances
produced
a
harrowing
effect
upon
the
young
girl
's
imagination
.
<EOS>
But
when
all
was
over
,
a
sorrowful
calm
succeeded
,
and
,
if
not
free
from
grief
,
she
was
tranquil
.
<EOS>
As
to
Thames
,
though
deeply
and
painfully
affected
by
the
horrible
occurrence
that
had
marked
his
return
to
his
old
friends
,
he
was
yet
able
to
control
his
feelings
,
and
devote
himself
to
the
alleviation
of
the
distress
of
the
more
immediate
sufferers
by
the
calamity
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
Sunday
evening
--
a
soft
delicious
evening
,
and
,
from
the
happy
,
<EOS>
_
cheerful
<EOS>
_
look
of
the
house
,
none
would
have
dreamed
of
the
dismal
tragedy
so
lately
acted
within
its
walls
.
<EOS>
The
birds
were
singing
blithely
amid
the
trees,--the
lowing
of
the
cows
resounded
from
the
yard,--a
delicious
perfume
from
the
garden
was
wafted
through
the
open
window,--at
a
distance
,
the
church
-
bells
of
Willesden
were
heard
tolling
for
evening
service
.
<EOS>
All
these
things
spoke
of
<EOS>
peace;--but
there
are
seasons
when
the
pleasantest
external
influences
have
a
depressing
effect
on
the
mind
,
by
painfully
recalling
past
happiness
.
<EOS>
So
,
at
least
,
thought
one
of
two
persons
who
were
seated
together
in
a
small
back
-
parlour
of
the
house
at
Dollis
Hill
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
lovely
girl
,
attired
in
deep
mourning
,
and
having
an
expression
of
profound
sorrow
on
her
charming
features
.
<EOS>
Her
companion
was
a
portly
handsome
man
,
also
dressed
in
a
full
suit
of
the
deepest
mourning
,
with
the
finest
of
lace
at
his
bosom
and
wrists
,
and
a
sword
in
a
black
sheath
by
his
side
.
<EOS>
These
persons
were
Mr.
Kneebone
and
Winifred
.
 
<EOS>
The
funeral
,
it
has
just
been
said
,
took
place
on
that
day
.
<EOS>
Amongst
others
who
attended
the
sad
ceremony
was
Mr.
Kneebone
.
<EOS>
Conceiving
himself
called
upon
,
as
the
intimate
friend
of
the
deceased
,
to
pay
this
last
tribute
of
respect
to
her
memory
,
he
appeared
as
one
of
the
chief
mourners
.
<EOS>
Overcome
by
his
affliction
,
Mr.
Wood
had
retired
to
his
own
room
,
where
he
had
just
summoned
Thames
.
<EOS>
Much
to
her
annoyance
,
therefore
,
Winifred
was
left
alone
with
the
woollen
-
draper
,
who
following
up
a
maxim
of
his
own
,
"
that
nothing
was
gained
by
too
much
bashfulness
,
"
determined
to
profit
by
the
opportunity
.
<EOS>
He
had
only
been
prevented
,
indeed
,
by
a
fear
of
Mrs.
Wood
from
pressing
his
suit
long
ago
.
<EOS>
This
obstacle
removed
,
he
thought
he
might
now
make
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
Happen
what
might
,
he
could
not
be
in
a
worse
position
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
had
a
sad
loss
,
<EOS>
my
dear
Winifred
,
"
<EOS>
he
began,--"for
<EOS>
I
must
use
the
privilege
of
an
old
friend
,
and
address
you
by
that
familiar
name,--we
have
had
a
sad
loss
in
the
death
of
your
lamented
parent
,
whose
memory
I
shall
for
ever
revere
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Winifred
's
eyes
filled
with
tears
.
<EOS>
This
was
not
exactly
what
the
woollen
-
draper
desired
.
<EOS>
So
he
resolved
to
try
another
tack
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
a
very
remarkable
thing
it
is
,
"
he
observed
,
applying
to
his
snuff
-
box
,
"
that
Thames
Darrell
,
whom
we
all
supposed
dead,"--Kneebone
in
his
heart
sincerely
wished
he
_
had
_
been
so,--"should
turn
out
to
be
alive
after
all
.
<EOS>
Strange
,
I
should
n't
know
him
when
he
called
on
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
<EOS>
_
is
_
strange
,
"
replied
Winifred
,
artlessly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
_
I
_
knew
him
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
rejoined
Kneebone
,
a
little
maliciously
,
"
but
that
's
easily
accounted
for
.
<EOS>
May
I
be
permitted
,
as
a
very
old
and
very
dear
friend
of
your
lamented
parent
,
whose
loss
I
shall
ever
deplore
,
to
ask
you
one
question
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Undoubtedly
,
"
replied
Winifred
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
will
answer
it
frankly
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Certainly
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Now
for
it
,
"
thought
the
woollen
-
draper
,
"
I
shall
,
at
least
,
ascertain
how
the
land
lies.--Well
,
then
,
my
dear
,
"
he
added
aloud
,
"
do
you
still
entertain
the
strong
attachment
you
did
to
Captain
Darrell
?
"
 
<EOS>
Winifred
's
cheeks
glowed
with
blushes
,
and
fixing
her
eyes
,
which
flashed
with
resentment
,
upon
the
questioner
,
she
said
:
 
"
I
have
promised
to
answer
your
question
,
and
I
will
do
so
.
<EOS>
I
love
him
as
a
brother
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
_
Only
_
as
a
brother
?
<EOS>
"
persisted
Kneebone
.
 
<EOS>
If
Winifred
remained
silent
,
her
looks
would
have
disarmed
a
person
of
less
assurance
than
the
woollen
-
draper
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
knew
how
much
importance
I
attach
to
your
answer
,
"
he
continued
passionately
,
"
you
would
not
refuse
me
one
.
<EOS>
Were
Captain
Darrell
to
offer
you
his
hand
,
would
you
accept
it
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
impertinence
deserves
very
different
treatment
,
Sir
,
"
said
Winifred
;
"
but
,
to
put
an
end
to
this
annoyance
,
I
will
tell
you
--
I
would
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
why
not
?
"
asked
Kneebone
,
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
submit
to
be
thus
interrogated
,
"
said
Winifred
,
angrily
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
the
name
of
your
lamented
parent
,
whose
memory
I
shall
for
ever
revere
,
I
implore
you
to
answer
me
,
"
urged
Kneebone
,
"
why
--
why
would
you
not
accept
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Because
our
positions
are
different
,
"
replied
Winifred
,
who
could
not
resist
this
appeal
to
her
feelings
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
paragon
of
prudence
and
discretion
,
"
rejoined
the
woollen
-
draper
,
drawing
his
chair
closer
to
hers
.
<EOS>
"
Disparity
of
rank
is
ever
productive
of
unhappiness
in
the
married
state
.
<EOS>
When
Captain
Darrell
's
birth
is
ascertained
,
I
've
no
doubt
he
'll
turn
out
a
nobleman
's
son
.
<EOS>
At
least
,
I
hope
so
for
his
sake
as
well
as
my
own
,
"
he
added
,
mentally
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
quite
the
air
of
one
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
my
angel
,
that
I
am
acquainted
with
your
sentiments
on
this
subject
,
I
shall
readily
fulfil
a
promise
which
I
made
to
your
lamented
parent
,
whose
loss
I
shall
ever
deplore
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
promise
to
my
mother
?
"
said
Winifred
,
unsuspiciously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
angel
,
to
_
her_--rest
her
soul
!
<EOS>
She
extorted
it
from
me
,
and
bound
me
by
a
solemn
oath
to
fulfil
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
name
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
party
concerned
.
<EOS>
Promise
me
that
you
will
not
disobey
the
injunctions
of
her
whose
memory
we
must
both
of
us
ever
revere
.
<EOS>
Promise
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
in
my
power
--
certainly
.
<EOS>
But
,
what
is
it
!
<EOS>
What
_
did
_
<EOS>
you
promise
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
To
offer
you
my
heart
,
my
hand
,
my
life
,
"
replied
Kneebone
,
falling
at
her
feet
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
!
"
exclaimed
Winifred
,
rising
.
 
<EOS>
"
Inequality
of
rank
can
be
no
bar
to
_
our
_
union
,
"
continued
Kneebone
.
<EOS>
"
Heaven
be
praised
,
_
I
_
am
not
the
son
of
a
nobleman
.
"
 
<EOS>
In
spite
of
her
displeasure
,
Winifred
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
absurdity
of
this
address
.
<EOS>
Taking
this
for
encouragement
,
her
suitor
proceeded
still
more
extravagantly
.
<EOS>
Seizing
her
hand
he
covered
it
with
kisses
.
 
<EOS>
"
Adorable
girl
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
in
the
most
impassioned
tone
,
and
with
the
most
impassioned
look
he
could
command
.
"
<EOS>
Adorable
girl
,
I
have
long
loved
you
to
desperation
.
<EOS>
Your
lamented
mother
,
whose
loss
I
shall
ever
deplore
,
perceived
my
passion
and
encouraged
it
.
<EOS>
Would
she
were
alive
to
back
my
suit
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
beyond
all
endurance
,
"
said
Winifred
,
<EOS>
striving
to
withdraw
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Leave
me
,
Sir
;
I
insist
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Never
!
"
rejoined
Kneebone
,
with
increased
ardour,--"never
,
till
I
receive
from
your
own
lips
the
answer
which
is
to
make
me
the
happiest
or
the
most
miserable
of
mankind
.
<EOS>
Hear
me
,
adorable
girl
!
<EOS>
You
know
not
the
extent
of
my
devotion
.
<EOS>
No
mercenary
consideration
influences
me
.
<EOS>
Love
--
admiration
for
your
matchless
beauty
alone
sways
me
.
<EOS>
Let
your
father
--
if
he
chooses
,
leave
all
his
wealth
to
his
adopted
son
.
<EOS>
I
care
not
.
<EOS>
Possessed
of
_
you
_
,
I
shall
have
a
treasure
such
as
kings
could
not
boast
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
cease
this
nonsense
,
"
said
Winifred
,
"
and
quit
the
room
,
or
I
will
call
for
assistance
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
the
door
opened
,
and
Thames
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
As
the
woollen
-
draper
's
back
was
towards
him
,
he
did
not
perceive
him
,
but
continued
his
passionate
addresses
.
 
<EOS>
"
Call
as
you
please
,
beloved
girl
,
"
he
cried
,
"
I
will
not
stir
till
I
am
answered
.
<EOS>
You
say
that
you
only
love
Captain
Darrell
as
a
brother--
"
 
"
Mr.
Kneebone
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
you
would
not
accept
him
were
he
to
offer--
<EOS>
"
 
"
Be
silent
,
Sir
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
then
,
"
continued
the
woollen
-
draper
,
"
is
no
longer
considered--
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
,
Sir
?
"
cried
Thames
,
advancing
,
"
what
is
the
meaning
of
your
reference
to
my
name
?
<EOS>
Have
you
dared
to
insult
this
lady
?
<EOS>
If
so--
"
 
"
Insult
her
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Kneebone
,
rising
,
and
endeavouring
to
hide
his
embarrassment
under
a
look
of
defiance
.
<EOS>
"
Far
from
,
it
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
I
have
made
her
an
honourable
proposal
of
marriage
,
in
compliance
with
the
request
of
her
lamented
parent
,
whose
memory--
"
 
"
Dare
to
utter
that
falsehood
in
my
hearing
again
,
scoundrel
,
"
interrupted
Thames
fiercely
,
"
and
I
will
put
it
out
of
your
power
to
repeat
the
offence
.
<EOS>
Leave
the
room
!
<EOS>
leave
the
house
,
Sir
!
and
enter
it
again
at
your
peril
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
do
neither
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Kneebone
,
"
unless
I
am
requested
by
this
lady
to
withdraw,--in
<EOS>
which
case
I
shall
comply
with
her
request
.
<EOS>
And
you
have
to
thank
her
presence
,
hot
-
headed
boy
,
that
I
do
not
chastise
your
insolence
as
it
deserves
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Go
,
Mr.
Kneebone,--pray
go
!
"
<EOS>
implored
Winifred
.
<EOS>
"
Thames
,
I
entreat--
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
wishes
are
my
laws
,
beloved
,
girl
,
"
replied
Kneebone
,
bowing
profoundly
.
"
<EOS>
Captain
Darren
,
"
he
added
,
sternly
,
"
you
shall
hear
from
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
When
you
please
,
Sir
,
"
said
Thames
,
coldly
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
woollen
-
draper
departed
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
all
this
,
dear
Winny
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Thames
,
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
--
nothing
,
"
she
answered
,
bursting
into
tears
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
ask
me
about
it
now
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Winny
,
"
said
Thames
,
tenderly
,
"
something
which
that
self
-
sufficient
fool
has
said
has
so
far
done
me
a
service
in
enabling
me
to
speak
upon
a
subject
which
I
have
long
had
upon
my
lips
,
but
have
not
had
courage
to
utter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Thames
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
seem
to
doubt
my
love
,
"
he
continued,--"you
seem
to
think
that
change
of
circumstances
may
produce
some
change
in
my
affections
.
<EOS>
Hear
me
then
,
now
,
before
I
take
one
step
to
establish
my
origin
,
or
secure
my
rights
.
<EOS>
Whatever
those
rights
may
be
,
whoever
I
am
,
my
heart
is
yours
.
<EOS>
Do
you
accept
it
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Dear
Thames
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Forgive
this
ill
-
timed
avowal
of
my
love

<EOS>
But
,
answer
me
.
<EOS>
Am
I
mistaken
?
<EOS>
Is
your
heart
mine
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
--
it
is
;
and
has
ever
been
,
"
replied
Winifred
,
falling
upon
his
neck
.
 
<EOS>
Lovers
'
confidences

be
respected

We

<EOS>
CHAPTER
VII
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
Sheppard
warns
Thames
Darrell
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
following
night
--
namely
Monday,--the
family
assembled
together
,
for
the
first
time
since
the
fatal
event
,
in
the
chamber
to
which
Thames
had
been
introduced
on
his
arrival
at
Dollis
Hill
.
<EOS>
As
this
had
been
Mrs.
Wood
's
favourite
sitting
-
room
,
and
her
image
was
so
intimately
associated
with
it
,
neither
the
carpenter
nor
his
daughter
could
muster
courage
to
enter
it
before
.
<EOS>
Determined
,
however
,
to
conquer
the
feeling
as
soon
as
possible
,
Wood
had
given
orders
to
have
the
evening
meal
served
there
;
but
,
notwithstanding
all
his
good
resolutions
upon
his
first
entrance
,
he
had
much
ado
to
maintain
his
self
-
command
.
<EOS>
His
wife
's
portrait
had
been
removed
from
the
walls
,
and
the
place
it
had
occupied
was
only
to
be
known
by
the
cord
by
which
it
had
been
suspended
.
<EOS>
The
very
blank
,
however
,
affected
him
more
deeply
than
if
it
had
been
left
.
<EOS>
Then
a
handkerchief
was
thrown
over
the
cage
,
to
prevent
the
bird
from
singing
;
it
was
_
<EOS>
her
_
favourite
canary
.
<EOS>
The
flowers
upon
the
mantel
-
shelf
were
withered
and
drooping--_she
_
had
gathered
them
.
<EOS>
All
these
circumstances,--slight
in
themselves
,
but
powerful
in
their
effect,--touched
the
heart
of
the
widowed
carpenter
,
and
added
to
his
depression
.
 
<EOS>
Supper
was
over
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
discussed
in
silence
.
<EOS>
The
cloth
was
removed
,
and
Wood
,
drawing
the
table
as
near
the
window
as
possible
--
for
it
was
getting
dusk
--
put
on
his
spectacles
,
and
opened
that
sacred
volume
from
which
the
best
consolation
in
affliction
is
derived
,
and
left
the

for
such
they

be

to
their
own
conversation

<EOS>
Having
already
expressed
our
determination
not
to
betray
any
confidences
of
this
sort
,
which
,
however
interesting
to
the
parties
concerned
,
could
not
possibly
be
so
to
others
,
we
shall
omit
also
the
"
love
passages
,
"
and
proceeding
to
such
topics
as
may
have
general
interest
,
take
up
the
discourse
at
the
point
when
Thames
Darrell
expressed
his
determination
of
starting
for
Manchester
,
as
soon
as
Jack
Sheppard
's
examination
had
taken
place
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
surprised
we
have
received
no
summons
for
attendance
to
-
day
,
"
he
remarked
;
"
perhaps
the
other
robber
may
be
secured
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Or
Jack
have
escaped
,
"
remarked
Winny
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
that
's
likely
.
<EOS>
But
,
this
sad
affair
disposed
of
<EOS>
,
I
will
not
rest
till
I
have
avenged
my
murdered
parents
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
'
_
<EOS>
The
avenger
of
blood
himself
shall
slay
the
murderer
_
'
,
"
said
Wood
,
who
was
culling
for
himself
certain
texts
from
the
scriptures
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
voice
of
inspiration
,
"
said
Thames
;
"
and
I
receive
it
as
a
solemn
command
.
<EOS>
The
villain
has
enjoyed
his
security
too
long
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
'
_
Bloody
and
deceitful
men
shall
not
live
half
their
days
_
'
,
"
said
Wood
,
reading
aloud
another
passage
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
yet
,
_
he
_
has
been
spared
thus
long
;
perhaps
with
a
wise
purpose
,
"
rejoined
Thames
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
though
the
storm
has
spared
him
,
_
<EOS>
I
_
will
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
'
_
No
doubt
_
,
'
"
said
Wood
,
who
had
again
turned
over
the
leaves
of
the
sacred
volume--
'
,
"
_
<EOS>
no
doubt
this
man
is
a
murderer
,
<EOS>
whom
,
though
he
escaped
the
seas
,
yet
vengeance
suffereth
not
to
live
_
'
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
feelings
of
consanguinity
shall
stay
my
vengeance
,
"
said
Thames
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
have
no
satisfaction
but
his
life
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
'
_
Thou
shalt
take
no
satisfaction
for
the
life
of
a
murderer
which
is
guilty
of
death
,
but
he
shall
surely
be
put
to
death
_
'
,
"
said
Wood
referring
to
another
text
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
steel
your
heart
against
him
,
dear
Thames
,
"
interposed
Winifred
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
_
And
thine
eye
shall
not
pity
_
,
'
"
said
her
father
,
in
a
tone
of
rebuke
,
"
'
_
<EOS>
but
,
life

be

foot

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
As
these
words
were
delivered
by
the
carpenter
with
stern
emphasis
,
a
female
servant
entered
the
room
,
and
stated
that
a
gentleman
was
at
the
door
,
who
wished
to
speak
with
Captain
Darell
on
business
of
urgent
importance
.
 
<EOS>
"
With
me
?
"
said
Thames
.
<EOS>
"
Who
is
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
did
n't
give
his
name
,
Sir
,
"
replied
the
maid
;
"
but
he
's
a
young
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
go
near
him
,
dear
Thames
,
"
said
Winifred
;
"
he
may
have
some
ill
intention
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pshaw
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Thames
.
<EOS>
"
What
!
refuse
to
see
a
person
who
desires
to
speak
with
me
.
<EOS>
Say
I
will
come
to
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Law
!
<EOS>
Miss
,
"
observed
the
maid
,
"
there
's
nothing
mischievous
in
the
person
's
appearance
,
I
'm
sure
.
<EOS>
He
's
as
nice
and
civil
-
spoken
a
gentleman
as
need
be
;
by
the
same
token
,
"
she
added
,
in
an
under
tone
,
"
that
he
gave
me
a
span
new
crown
piece
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
'
_
The
thief
cometh
in
the
night
,
and
the
troop
of
robbers
spoileth
without
_
,
'
"
said
Wood
,
who
had
a
text
for
every
emergency
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lor
'
ha
'
mussy
,
Sir!--how
you
<EOS>
_
do
_
talk
,
"
said
the
woman
;
"
this
is
no
robber
,
I
'm
sure
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
known
at
a
glance
if
it
was
.
<EOS>
He
's
more
like
a
lord
than--
<EOS>
"
 
As
she
spoke
,
steps
were
heard
approaching
;
the
door
was
thrown
open
,
and
a
young
man
marched
boldly
into
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
The
intruder
was
handsomely
,
even
richly
,
attired
in
a
scarlet
riding
-
suit
,
embroidered
with
gold
;
a
broad
belt
,
to
which
a
hanger
was
attached
,
crossed
his
shoulders
;
his
boots
rose
above
his
knee
,
and
he
carried
a
laced
hat
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
Advancing
to
the
middle
of
the
chamber
,
he
halted
,
drew
himself
up
,
and
fixed
his
dark
,
expressive
eyes
,
on
Thames
Darrell
.
<EOS>
His
appearance
excited
the
greatest
astonishment
and
consternation
amid
the
group
.
<EOS>
Winifred
screamed
.
<EOS>
Thames
sprang
to
his
feet
,
and
half
drew
his
sword
,
while
Wood
,
removing
his
spectacles
to
assure
himself
that
his
eyes
did
not
deceive
him
,
exclaimed
in
a
tone
and
with
a
look
that
betrayed
the
extremity
of
surprise--"Jack
Sheppard
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Jack
Sheppard
!
"
echoed
the
maid
.
<EOS>
"
Is
this
Jack
Sheppard
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
la
!
<EOS>
I
'm
undone
!
<EOS>
We
shall
all
have
our
throats
cut
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
oh
!
"
<EOS>
And
she
rushed
,
screaming
,
into
the
passage
where
she
fell
down
in
a
fit
.
 
<EOS>
The
occasion
of
all
this
confusion
and
dismay
,
meanwhile
,
remained
perfectly
motionless
;
his
figure
erect
,
and
with
somewhat
of
dignity
in
his
demeanour
.
<EOS>
He
kept
his
keen
eyes
steadily
fixed
on
Thames
,
as
if
awaiting
to
be
addressed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
audacity
passes
belief
,
"
cried
the
latter
,
as
soon
as
his
surprise
would
allow
him
utterance
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
have
contrived
to
break
out
of
your
confinement
,
villain
,
this
is
the
last
place
where
you
ought
to
show
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
,
therefore
,
the
first
I
would
visit
,
"
replied
Jack
,
boldly
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
pardon
my
intrusion
.
<EOS>
I
was
_
resolved
_
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
And
,
fearing
you
might
not
come
to
me
,
I
forced
my
way
hither
,
even
with
certainty
of
discomposing
your
friends
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
villain
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Thames
,
"
I
know
not
the
motive
of
your
visit
.
<EOS>
But
,
if
you
have
come
to
surrender
yourself
to
justice
,
it
is
well
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
depart
hence
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Can
not
?
"
echoed
Jack
,
a
slight
smile
crossing
his
features
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
let
that
pass
.
<EOS>
My
motive
in
coming
hither
is
to
serve
you
,
and
save
your
life
.
<EOS>
If
you
choose
to
requite
me
by
detaining
me
,
you
are
at
liberty
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
I
shall
make
no
defence
.
<EOS>
That
I
am
not
ignorant
of
the
reward
offered
for
my
capture
this
will
show
,
"
he
added
,
taking
a
large
placard
headed
'
_
Murder
_
'
from
his
pocket
,
and
throwing
it
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
"
My
demeanour
ought
to
convince
you
that
I
came
with
no
hostile
intention
.
<EOS>
And
,
to
show
you
that
I
have
no
intention
of
flying
,
I
will
myself
close
and
lock
the
door
.
<EOS>
There
is
the
key
.
<EOS>
Are
you
now
satisfied
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
interposed
Wood
,
furiously
,
"
I
shall
never
be
satisfied
till
I
see
you
hanged
on
the
highest
gibbet
at
Tyburn
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
time
may
come
when
you
will
be
gratified
,
Mr.
Wood
,
"
replied
Jack
,
calmly
.
 
<EOS>
"
May
come!--it
_
will
_
come!--it
_
shall
_
come
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
carpenter
,
shaking
his
hand
menacingly
at
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
some
difficulty
in
preventing
myself
from
becoming
your
executioner
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
that
I
should
have
nursed
such
a
viper
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hear
me
,
Sir
,
"
said
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
wo
n't
hear
you
,
murderer
,
"
rejoined
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
no
murderer
,
"
replied
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
no
thought
of
injuring
your
wife
,
and
would
have
died
rather
than
commit
so
foul
a
crime
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Think
not
to
delude
me
,
audacious
wretch
,
"
cried
the
carpenter
.
<EOS>
"
Even
if
you
are
not
a
principal
,
you
are
an
accessory
.
<EOS>
If
you
had
not
brought
your
companion
here
,
it
would
not
have
happened
.
<EOS>
But
you
shall
swing
,
rascal,--you
shall
swing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
conscience
acquits
me
of
all
share
in
the
offence
,
"
replied
Jack
,
humbly
.
"
<EOS>
But
the
past
is
irremediable
,
and
I
did
not
come
hither
to
exculpate
myself
,
I
came
to
save
_
your
_
life
,
"
he
added
,
turning
to
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
not
aware
it
was
in
danger
,
"
rejoined
Darrell
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
ought
to
be
thankful
to
me
for
the
warning
.
<EOS>
You
_
are
_
in
danger
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
From
some
of
your
associates
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
From
your
uncle
,
from
_
my
_
uncle,--Sir
Rowland
Trenchard
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
means
this
idle
boasting
,
villain
?
"
said
Thames
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Your
_
uncle
,
Sir
Rowland
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
no
idle
boasting
,
"
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
cousin
to
the
housebreaker
,
Jack
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
it
were
so
,
he
would
have
great
reason
to
be
proud
of
the
relationship
,
truly
,
"
observed
Wood
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
easy
to
make
an
assertion
like
this
,
"
said
Thames
,
contemptuously
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
equally
easy
to
prove
it
,
"
replied
Jack
,
giving
him
the
paper
he
had
abstracted
from
Wild
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Read
that
.
"
 
<EOS>
Thames
hastily
cast
his
eyes
over
it
,
and
transferred
it
,
with
a
look
of
incredulity
,
to
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
"
Gracious
Heavens
!
<EOS>
this
is
more
wonderful
than
all
the
rest
,
"
cried
the
carpenter
,
rubbing
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
Thames
,
this
is
no
forgery
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
believe
it
,
father
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
From
the
bottom
of
my
heart
.
<EOS>
I
always
thought
Mrs.
Sheppard
superior
to
her
station
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
did
I
,
"
said
Winifred
.
<EOS>
"
Let
me
look
at
the
paper
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
soul!--poor
soul
!
"
groaned
Wood
,
brushing
the
tears
from
his
vision
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
I
'm
glad
she
's
spared
this
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Jack
,
Jack
,
you
've
much
to
answer
for
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
,
indeed
,
"
replied
Sheppard
,
in
a
tone
of
contrition
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
this
document
is
correct
,
"
continued
Wood
,
"
and
I
am
persuaded
it
is
so,--you
are
as
unfortunate
as
wicked
.
<EOS>
See
what
your
misconduct
has
deprived
you
of
--
<EOS>
see
what
you
might
have
been
.
<EOS>
This
is
retribution
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
feel
it
,
"
replied
Jack
,
in
a
tone
of
agony
,
"
and
I
feel
it
more
on
my
poor
mother
's
account
than
my
own
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
has
suffered
enough
for
you
,
"
said
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
has
,
she
has
,
"
said
Jack
,
in
a
broken
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Weep
on
,
reprobate
,
"
cried
the
carpenter
,
a
little
softened
.
<EOS>
"
Those
tears
will
do
you
good
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
distress
him
,
dear
father
,
"
said
Winifred
;
"
he
suffers
deeply
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Jack
!
<EOS>
repent
,
while
it
is
yet
time
,
of
your
evil
conduct
.
<EOS>
I
will
pray
for
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
repent,--I
can
not
pray
,
"
replied
Jack
,
recovering
his
hardened
demeanour
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
never
have
been
what
I
am
,
but
for
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
so
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Winifred
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
loved
you
,
"
replied
Jack,--"don't
start
--
<EOS>
it
is
over
now
--
<EOS>
I
loved
you
,
I
say
,
as
a
boy
.
<EOS>
_
hopelessly
_
,
<EOS>
and
it
made
me
desperate
.
<EOS>
And
now
I
find
,
when
it
is
too
late
,
that
I
_
might
_
have
deserved
you
--
that
I
am
as
well
born
as
Thames
Darrell
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
n't
think
of
these
things
,
or
I
shall
grow
mad
.
<EOS>
I
have
said
your
life
is
in
danger
,
Thames
.
<EOS>
Do
not
slight
my
warning
.
<EOS>
Sir
Rowland
Trenchard
is
aware
of
your
return
to
England
.
<EOS>
I
saw
him
last
night
at
Jonathan
Wild
's
,
after
my
escape
from
the
New
Prison
.
<EOS>
He
had
just
arrived
from
Manchester
,
whence
he
had
been
summoned
by
that
treacherous
thief
-
taker
.
<EOS>
I
overheard
them
planning
your
assassination
.
<EOS>
It
is
to
take
place
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
O
Heavens
!
"
screamed
Winifred
,
while
her
father
lifted
up
his
hands
in
silent
horror
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
when
I
further
tell
you
,
"
continued
Jack
,
"
that
,
after
yourself
and
my
mother
,
_
<EOS>
I
_
am
the
next
heir
to
the
estates
of
my
grandfather
,
<EOS>
Sir
Montacute
Trenchard
,
you
will
perhaps
own
that
my
caution
is
sufficiently
disinterested
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Could
I
credit
your
wild
story
,
I
might
do
so
,
"
returned
Thames
,
with
a
look
of
perplexity
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
are
Jonathan
Wild
's
written
instructions
to
Quilt
Arnold
,
"
rejoined
Sheppard
,
producing
the
pocket
-
book
he
had
found
in
the
janizary
's
clothes
.
<EOS>
"
This
letter
will
vouch
for
me
that
a
communication
has
taken
place
between
your
enemies
.
"
 
<EOS>
Thames
glanced
at
the
despatch
,
and
,
after
a
moment
's
reflection
,
inquired
,
"
In
what
way
is
the
attempt
upon
my
life
to
be
made
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
I
could
n't
ascertain
,
"
replied
Jack
;
"
but
I
advise
you
to
be
upon
your
guard
.
<EOS>
For
aught
I
know
,
they
may
be
in
the
neighbourhood
at
this
moment
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Here
!
"
ejaculated
Wood
,
with
a
look
of
alarm
.
"
<EOS>
Oh
lord
!
<EOS>
I
hope
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
This
I
do
know
,
"
continued
Jack,--"Jonathan
Wild
superintends
the
attack
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Jonathan
Wild
!
"
repeated
the
carpenter
,
trembling
.
"
<EOS>
Then
it
's
all
over
with
us
.
<EOS>
Oh
dear!--how
<EOS>
sorry
I
am
<EOS>
I
ever
left
Wych
Street
.
<EOS>
We
may
be
all
murdered
in
this
unprotected
place
,
and
nobody
be
the
wiser
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
some
one
in
the
garden
at
this
moment
,
"
cried
Jack
;
"
I
saw
a
face
at
the
window
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Where
--
where
?
"
cried
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
stir
,
"
replied
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
at
once
convince
you
of
the
truth
of
my
assertions
,
and
ascertain
whether
the
enemy
really
is
at
hand
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
advanced
towards
the
window
,
threw
open
the
sash
,
and
called
out
in
the
voice
of
Thames
Darrell
,
"
Who
's
there
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
was
answered
by
a
shot
from
a
pistol
.
<EOS>
The
ball
passed
over
his
head
,
and
lodged
in
the
ceiling
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
right
,
"
replied
Jack
,
returning
as
coolly
as
if
nothing
had
happened
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
Your
uncle--_our
_
uncle
is
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
saw
them
both
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
May
I
trust
you
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Thames
,
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
,
"
replied
Jack
:
"
<EOS>
I
'll
fight
for
you
to
the
last
gasp
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Follow
me
,
then
,
"
cried
Thames
,
drawing
his
sword
,
and
springing
through
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
the
world
's
end
,
"
answered
Jack
,
darting
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thames!--Thames
!
"
cried
Winifred
,
rushing
to
the
window
.
<EOS>
"
He
will
be
murdered!--Help
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
child!--my
love
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Wood
,
dragging
her
forcibly
back
.
 
<EOS>
Two
shots
were
fired
,
and
presently
the
clashing
of
swords
was
heard
below
.
 
<EOS>
After
some
time
,
the
scuffle
grew
more
and
more
distant
,
until
nothing
could
be
heard
.
 
<EOS>
Wood
,
meanwhile
,
had
summoned
his
men
-
servants
,
and
having
armed
them
with
such
weapons
as
could
be
found
,
they
proceeded
to
the
garden
,
where
the
first
object
they
encountered
was
Thames
Darrell
,
extended
on
the
ground
,
and
weltering
in
his
blood
.
<EOS>
Of
Jack
Sheppard
or
the
assailants
they
could
not
discover
a
single
trace
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
body
was
borne
to
the
house
in
the
arms
of
the
farming
-
men
,
Mr.
Wood
fancied
he
heard
the
exulting
laugh
of
Jonathan
Wild
.
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VIII
.
 
<EOS>
Old
Bedlam
.
  
<EOS>
When
Thames
Darrell
and
Jack
Sheppard
sprang
through
the
window
,
they
were
instantly
assailed
by
Wild
,
Trenchard
,
and
their
attendants
.
<EOS>
Jack
attacked
Jonathan
with
such
fury
,
that
he
drove
him
into
a
shrubbery
,
and
might
perhaps
have
come
off
the
victor
,
if
his
foot
had
not
slipped
as
he
made
a
desperate
lunge
.
<EOS>
In
this
state
it
would
have
been
all
over
with
him
,
as
,
being
stunned
by
the
fall
,
it
was
some
moments
before
he
could
recover
himself
,
if
another
party
had
not
unexpectedly
come
to
his
rescue
.
<EOS>
This
was
Blueskin
,
who
burst
through
the
trees
,
and
sword
in
hand
assaulted
the
thief
-
taker
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
Jack
gained
his
legs
,
he
perceived
Blueskin
lying
,
as
he
thought
,
dead
in
the
plantation
,
with
a
severe
cut
across
his
temples
,
and
while
he
was
stooping
to
assist
him
,
he
heard
groans
at
a
little
distance
.
<EOS>
Hastening
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
,
he
discovered
Thames
Darrell
,
stretched
upon
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
hurt
,
Thames
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Jack
,
anxiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
dangerously
,
I
hope
,
"
returned
Thames
;
"
but
fly
--
save
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Where
are
the
assassins
?
"
cried
Sheppard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Gone
,
"
replied
the
wounded
man
.
<EOS>
"
They
imagine
their
work
is
done
.
<EOS>
But
I
may
yet
live
to
thwart
them
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
carry
you
to
the
house
,
or
fetch
Mr.
Wood
,
"
urged
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
rejoined
Thames
;
"
fly
--
or
I
will
not
answer
for
your
safety
.
<EOS>
If
you
desire
to
please
me
,
you
will
go
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
leave
you
thus
?
"
rejoined
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Go
,
I
insist
,
"
cried
Thames
,
"
or
take
the
consequences
upon
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
protect
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
Thus
urged
,
Jack
reluctantly
departed
.
<EOS>
Hastening
to
the
spot
where
he
had
tied
his
horse
to
a
tree
,
he
vaulted
into
the
saddle
,
and
rode
off
across
the
fields,--for
he
was
fearful
of
encountering
the
hostile
party,--till
he
reached
the
Edgeware
Road
.
<EOS>
Arrived
at
Paddington
,
he
struck
across
Marylebone
Fields,--for
as
yet
<EOS>
the
New
Road
was
undreamed
of,--and
never
moderated
his
speed
until
he
reached
the
city
.
<EOS>
His
destination
was
the
New
Mint
.
<EOS>
At
this
place
of
refuge
,
situated
in
the
heart
of
Wapping
,
near
the
river
-
side
,
he
arrived
in
less
than
an
hour
,
in
a
complete
state
of
exhaustion
.
 
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
the
infamous
abuse
of
its
liberties
,
an
act
for
the
entire
suppression
of
the
Old
Mint
was
passed
in
the
ninth
year
of
the
reign
of
George
the
First
,
not
many
months
before
the
date
of
the
present
epoch
of
this
history
;
and
as
,
after
the
destruction
of
Whitefriars
,
which
took
place
in
the
reign
of
Charles
the
Second
,
owing
to
the
protection
afforded
by
its
inmates
to
the
Levellers
and
Fifth
-
monarchy
-
men
,
when
the
inhabitants
of
Alsatia
crossed
the
water
,
and
settled
themselves
in
the
borough
of
Southwark,--so
now
,
driven
out
of
their
fastnesses
,
they
again
migrated
,
and
recrossing
the
Thames
,
settled
in
Wapping
,
in
a
miserable
quarter
between
Artichoke
Lane
and
Nightingale
Lane
,
which
they
termed
the
New
Mint
.
<EOS>
Ousted
from
his
old
retreat
,
the
Cross
Shovels
,
Baptist
Kettleby
opened
another
tavern
,
conducted
upon
the
same
plan
as
the
former
,
which
he
denominated
the
Seven
Cities
of
Refuge
.
<EOS>
His
subjects
,
however
,
were
no
longer
entirely
under
his
control
;
and
,
though
he
managed
to
enforce
some
little
attention
to
his
commands
,
it
was
evident
his
authority
was
waning
fast
.
<EOS>
Aware
that
they
would
not
be
allowed
to
remain
long
unmolested
,
the
New
Minters
conducted
themselves
so
outrageously
,
and
with
such
extraordinary
insolence
,
that
measures
were
at
this
time
being
taken
for
their
effectual
suppression
.
 
<EOS>
To
the
Seven
Cities
of
Refuge
Jack
proceeded
.
<EOS>
Having
disposed
of
his
steed
and
swallowed
a
glass
of
brandy
,
without
taking
any
other
refreshment
,
he
threw
himself
on
a
couch
,
where
he
sank
at
once
into
a
heavy
slumber
.
<EOS>
When
he
awoke
it
was
late
in
the
day
,
and
he
was
surprised
to
find
Blueskin
seated
by
his
bed
-
side
,
watching
over
him
with
a
drawn
sword
on
his
knee
,
a
pistol
in
each
hand
,
and
a
blood
-
stained
cloth
bound
across
his
brow
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
disturb
yourself
,
"
said
his
follower
,
motioning
him
to
keep
still
;
"
it
's
all
right
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
time
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
Past
noon
,
"
replied
Blueskin
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
awake
you
,
because
you
seemed
tired
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
did
you
escape
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Sheppard
,
who
,
as
he
shook
off
his
slumber
,
began
to
recall
the
events
of
the
previous
night
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
easily
enough
,
"
rejoined
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
must
have
been
senseless
for
some
time
;
for
,
on
coming
to
myself
,
I
found
this
gash
in
my
head
,
and
the
ground
covered
with
blood
.
<EOS>
However
,
no
one
had
discovered
me
,
so
I
contrived
to
drag
myself
to
my
horse
.
<EOS>
I
thought
if
you
were
living
,
and
not
captured
,
I
should
find
you
<EOS>
here,--and
<EOS>
I
was
right
.
<EOS>
I
kept
watch
over
you
,
for
fear
of
a
surprise
on
the
part
of
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
But
what
's
to
be
done
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
first
thing
I
do
,
"
replied
Jack
,
"
will
be
to
visit
my
poor
mother
in
Bedlam
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
'd
better
take
care
of
your
mother
's
son
instead
,
"
rejoined
Blueskin
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
runnin
'
a
great
risk
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Risk
,
or
no
risk
,
I
shall
go
,
"
replied
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
Jonathan
has
threatened
to
do
her
some
mischief
.
<EOS>
I
am
resolved
to
see
her
,
without
delay
,
and
ascertain
if
it
's
possible
to
remove
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
hopeless
job
,
"
grumbled
Blueskin
,
"
and
<EOS>
harm
will
come
of
it
.
<EOS>
What
are
you
to
do
with
a
mad
mother
at
a
time
when
you
need
all
your
wits
to
take
care
of
yourself
?
<EOS>
"
 
"
Do
n't
concern
yourself
further
about
me
,
"
returned
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
Once
for
all
,
I
shall
go
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
you
take
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
;
you
must
await
my
return
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
I
must
wait
a
long
time
,
"
grumbled
Blueskin
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
never
return
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
see
,
"
replied
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
if
I
should
_
not
_
return
,
take
this
purse
to
Edgeworth
Bess
.
<EOS>
You
'll
find
her
at
Black
Mary
's
Hole
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
having
partaken
of
a
hasty
breakfast
,
he
set
out
.
<EOS>
Taking
his
way
along
East
Smithfield
,
mounting
Little
Tower
-
hill
,
and
threading
the
Minories
and
Hounsditch
,
he
arrived
without
accident
or
molestation
,
at
Moorfields
.
 
<EOS>
Old
Bethlehem
,
or
Bedlam,--every
trace
of
which
has
been
swept
away
,
and
the
hospital
for
lunatics
removed
to
Saint
George
's
Field,--was
a
vast
and
magnificent
structure
.
<EOS>
Erected
in
Moorfields
in
1675
,
upon
the
model
of
the
Tuileries
,
it
is
said
that
Louis
the
Fourteenth
was
so
incensed
at
the
insult
offered
to
his
palace
,
that
he
had
a
counterpart
of
<EOS>
St.
James
's
built
for
offices
of
the
meanest
description
.
<EOS>
The
size
and
grandeur
of
the
edifice
,
indeed
,
drew
down
the
ridicule
of
several
of
the
wits
of
the
age
:
by
one
of
whom
--
the
facetious
Tom
Brown
--
it
was
said
,
"
Bedlam
is
a
pleasant
place
,
and
abounds
with
amusements;--the
<EOS>
first
of
which
is
the
building
,
so
stately
a
fabric
for
persons
wholly
insensible
of
the
beauty
and
use
of
it
:
the
outside
being
a
perfect
mockery
of
the
inside
,
and
admitting
of
two
amusing
<EOS>
queries,--Whether
<EOS>
the
persons
that
ordered
the
building
of
it
,
or
those
that
inhabit
it
,
were
the
maddest
?
<EOS>
and
,
whether
the
name
and
thing
be
not
as
disagreeable
as
harp
and
harrow
.
<EOS>
"
By
another
--
the
no
less
facetious
Ned
Ward
--
it
was
termed
,
"
A
costly
college
for
a
crack
-
brained
society
,
raised
in
a
mad
age
,
when
the
chiefs
of
the
city
were
in
a
great
danger
of
losing
their
senses
,
and
so
contrived
it
the
more
noble
for
their
own
reception
;
or
they
would
never
have
flung
away
so
much
money
to
so
foolish
a
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
The
cost
of
the
building
exceeded
seventeen
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
However
the
taste
of
the
architecture
may
be
questioned
,
which
was
the
formal
French
style
of
the
period
,
the
general
effect
was
imposing
.
<EOS>
Including
the
wings
,
it
presented
a
frontage
of
five
hundred
and
forty
feet
.
<EOS>
Each
wing
had
a
small
cupola
;
and
,
in
the
centre
of
the
pile
rose
a
larger
dome
,
surmounted
by
a
gilded
ball
and
vane
.
<EOS>
The
asylum
was
approached
by
a
broad
gravel
walk
,
leading
through
a
garden
edged
on
either
side
by
a
stone
balustrade
,
and
shaded
by
tufted
trees
.
<EOS>
A
wide
terrace
then
led
to
large
iron
gates
,
'
over
which
were
placed
the
two
celebrated
figures
of
Raving
and
Melancholy
Madness
,
executed
by
the
elder
Cibber
,
and
commemorated
by
Pope
in
the
Dunciad
,
in
the
well
-
known
lines:--
     
"
Close
to
those
walls
where
Folly
holds
her
throne
,
    
And
laughs
to
think
Monroe
would
take
her
down
,
    
<EOS>
Where
,
o'er
the
gates
,
by
his
famed
father
's
hand
,
    
_
Great
Cibber
's
brazen
,
brainless
brothers
stand
_
.
"
 
<EOS>
Internally
,
it
was
divided
by
two
long
galleries
,
one
over
the
other
.
<EOS>
These
galleries
were
separated
in
the
middle
by
iron
grates
.
<EOS>
The
wards
on
the
right
were
occupied
by
male
patients
,
on
the
left
by
the
female
.
<EOS>
In
the
centre
of
the
upper
gallery
was
a
spacious
saloon
,
appropriated
to
the
governors
of
the
asylum
.
<EOS>
But
the
besetting
evil
of
the
place
,
and
that
which
drew
down
the
severest
censures
of
the
writers
above
-
mentioned
,
was
that
this
spot,--which
of
all
others
should
have
been
most
free
from
such
intrusion
--
was
made
a
public
exhibition
.
<EOS>
There
all
the
loose
characters
thronged
,
assignations
were
openly
made
,
and
the
spectators
diverted
themselves
with
the
vagaries
of
its
miserable
inhabitants
.
 
<EOS>
Entering
the
outer
gate
,
and
traversing
the
broad
gravel
walk
before
-
mentioned
,
Jack
ascended
the
steps
,
and
was
admitted
,
on
feeing
the
porter
,
by
another
iron
gate
,
into
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
Here
he
was
almost
stunned
by
the
deafening
clamour
resounding
on
all
sides
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
lunatics
were
rattling
their
chains
;
some
shrieking
;
some
singing
;
<EOS>
some
beating
with
frantic
violence
against
the
doors
.
<EOS>
Altogether
,
it
was
the
most
dreadful
noise
he
had
ever
heard
.
<EOS>
Amidst
it
all
,
however
,
there
were
several
light
-
hearted
and
laughing
groups
walking
from
cell
to
cell
to
whom
all
this
misery
appeared
matter
of
amusement
.
<EOS>
The
doors
of
several
of
the
wards
were
thrown
open
for
these
parties
,
and
as
Jack
passed
,
he
could
not
help
glancing
at
the
wretched
inmates
.
<EOS>
Here
was
a
poor
half
-
naked
creature
,
with
a
straw
crown
on
his
head
,
and
a
wooden
sceptre
in
his
hand
,
seated
on
the
ground
with
all
the
dignity
of
a
monarch
on
his
throne
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
mad
musician
,
seemingly
rapt
in
admiration
of
the
notes
he
was
extracting
from
a
child
's
violin
.
<EOS>
Here
was
a
terrific
figure
gnashing
his
teeth
,
and
howling
like
a
wild
beast;--there
a
lover
,
with
hands
clasped
together
and
eyes
turned
passionately
upward
.
<EOS>
In
this
cell
was
a
huntsman
,
who
had
fractured
his
skull
while
hunting
,
and
was
perpetually
hallooing
after
the
hounds;--in
that
,
the
most
melancholy
of
all
,
the
grinning
gibbering
lunatic
,
the
realization
of
"
moody
madness
,
laughing
wild
.
"
 
<EOS>
Hastening
from
this
heart
-
rending
spectacle
,
Jack
soon
reached
the
grating
that
divided
the
men
's
compartment
from
that
appropriated
to
the
women
.
<EOS>
Inquiring
for
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
a
matron
offered
to
conduct
him
to
her
cell
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
'll
find
her
quiet
enough
to
-
day
,
Sir
,
"
observed
the
woman
,
as
they
walked
along
;
"
but
she
has
been
very
outrageous
latterly
.
<EOS>
Her
nurse
says
she
may
live
some
time
;
but
she
seems
to
me
to
be
sinking
fast
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Heaven
help
her
!
"
<EOS>
sighed
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Her
release
would
be
a
mercy
,
"
pursued
the
matron
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Sir
,
if
you
'd
seen
her
as
I
've
seen
her
,
you
'd
not
wish
her
a
continuance
of
misery
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
Jack
made
no
reply
,
the
woman
proceeded
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
say
her
son
's
taken
at
last
,
and
is
to
be
hanged
.
<EOS>
I
'm
glad
of
it
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sure
;
for
it
's
all
owing
to
him
<EOS>
his
poor
mother
's
here
.
<EOS>
See
what
crime
does
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
Those
who
act
wickedly
bring
misery
on
all
connected
with
them
.
<EOS>
And
so
gentle
as
the
poor
creature
is
,
when
she
's
not
in
her
wild
fits
--
it
would
melt
a
heart
of
stone
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
She
will
cry
for
days
and
nights
together
.
<EOS>
If
Jack
Sheppard
could
behold
his
mother
in
this
state
,
he
'd
have
a
lesson
he
'd
never
forget
--
ay
,
and
a
severer
one
than
even
the
hangman
could
read
him
.
<EOS>
Hardened
as
he
may
be
,
that
would
touch
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
has
never
been
near
her
--
never
.
"
 
<EOS>
Rambling
in
this
way
,
the
matron
at
length
came
to
a
halt
,
and
taking
out
a
key
,
pointed
to
a
door
and
said
,
"
This
is
Mrs.
Sheppard
's
ward
,
Sir
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Leave
us
together
,
my
good
woman
,
"
said
Jack
,
putting
a
guinea
into
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
long
as
you
please
,
Sir
,
"
answered
the
matron
,
dropping
a
curtsey
.
<EOS>
"
There
,
Sir
,
"
she
added
,
unlocking
the
door
,
"
you
can
go
in
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
frightened
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
's
not
mischievous
--
and
besides
she
's
chained
,
and
ca
n't
reach
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
she
retired
,
and
Jack
entered
the
cell
.
 
<EOS>
Prepared
as
he
was
for
a
dreadful
shock
,
and
with
his
nerves
strung
to
endure
it
,
Jack
absolutely
recoiled
before
the
appalling
object
that
met
his
gaze
.
<EOS>
Cowering
in
a
corner
upon
a
heap
of
straw
sat
his
unfortunate
mother
,
the
complete
wreck
of
what
she
had
been
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
glistened
in
the
darkness
--
for
light
was
only
admitted
through
a
small
grated
window
--
like
flames
,
and
,
as
she
fixed
them
on
him
,
their
glances
seemed
to
penetrate
his
very
soul
.
<EOS>
A
piece
of
old
blanket
was
fastened
across
her
shoulders
,
and
she
had
no
other
clothing
except
a
petticoat
.
<EOS>
Her
arms
and
feet
were
uncovered
,
and
of
almost
skeleton
thinness
.
<EOS>
Her
features
were
meagre
,
and
ghastly
white
,
and
had
the
fixed
and
horrible
stamp
of
insanity
.
<EOS>
Her
head
had
been
shaved
,
and
around
it
was
swathed
a
piece
of
rag
,
in
which
a
few
straws
were
stuck
.
<EOS>
Her
thin
fingers
were
armed
with
nails
as
long
as
the
talons
of
a
bird
.
<EOS>
A
chain
,
riveted
to
an
iron
belt
encircling
her
waist
,
bound
her
to
the
wall
.
<EOS>
The
cell
in
which
she
was
confined
was
about
six
feet
long
and
four
wide
;
the
walls
were
scored
all
over
with
fantastic
designs
,
snatches
of
poetry
,
short
sentences
and
names,--the
work
of
its
former
occupants
,
and
of
its
present
inmate
.
 
<EOS>
When
Jack
entered
the
cell
,
she
was
talking
to
herself
in
the
muttering
unconnected
way
peculiar
to
her
distracted
condition
;
but
,
after
her
eye
had
rested
on
him
some
time
,
the
fixed
expression
of
her
features
relaxed
,
and
a
smile
crossed
them
.
<EOS>
This
smile
was
more
harrowing
even
than
her
former
rigid
look
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
an
angel
,
"
she
cried
,
with
a
look
beaming
with
delight
.
 
<EOS>
"
Rather
a
devil
,
"
groaned
her
son
,
"
to
have
done
this
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
an
angel
<EOS>
,
I
say
,
"
continued
the
poor
maniac
;
"
and
my
Jack
would
have
been
like
you
,
if
he
had
lived
.
<EOS>
But
he
died
when
he
was
a
child
--
long
ago
--
long
ago
--
long
ago
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Would
he
had
done
so
!
"
cried
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
Old
Van
told
me
if
he
grew
up
he
would
be
hanged
.
<EOS>
He
showed
me
a
black
mark
under
his
ear
,
where
the
noose
would
be
tied
.
<EOS>
And
so
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
did--
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
she
burst
into
a
laugh
that
froze
Jack
's
blood
in
his
veins
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
in
a
broken
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
strangled
him
--
ha
!
ha
!
ha!--strangled
him
while
he
was
at
my
breast
--
ha
!
ha!"--And
<EOS>
then
with
a
sudden
and
fearful
change
of
look
,
she
added
,
"
That
's
what
has
driven
me
mad
,
I
killed
my
child
to
save
him
from
the
gallows
--
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
One
man
hanged
in
a
family
is
enough
.
<EOS>
If
I
'd
not
gone
mad
,
they
would
have
hanged
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
soul
!
<EOS>
"
ejaculated
her
son
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
a
dream
<EOS>
I
had
last
night
,
"
continued
the
unfortunate
being
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
at
Tyburn
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
gallows
erected
,
and
a
great
mob
round
it
--
thousands
of
people
,
and
all
with
white
faces
like
corpses
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
them
there
was
a
cart
with
a
man
in
it
--
and
that
man
was
Jack
--
my
son
Jack
<EOS>
--
they
were
going
to
hang
him
.
<EOS>
And
opposite
to
him
,
with
a
book
in
his
hand,--but
<EOS>
it
could
n't
be
a
prayer
-
book,--sat
Jonathan
Wild
,
in
a
parson
's
cassock
and
band
.
<EOS>
I
knew
him
in
spite
of
his
dress
.
<EOS>
And
when
they
came
to
the
gallows
,
Jack
leaped
out
of
the
cart
,
and
the
hangman
tied
up
Jonathan
instead
--
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
How
the
mob
shouted
and
huzzaed
--
and
I
shouted
too
--
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mother
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jack
,
unable
to
endure
this
agonizing
scene
longer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
know
me
,
mother
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
shrieked
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
What
's
that?--Jack
's
voice
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
"
replied
her
son
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
ceiling
is
breaking
!
<EOS>
the
floor
is
opening
!
<EOS>
he
is
coming
to
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
unhappy
woman
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
stands
before
you
,
"
rejoined
her
son
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
?
"
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
see
him
.
<EOS>
Where
is
he
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Here
,
"
answered
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
his
ghost
,
then
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
--
no
,
"
answered
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
your
most
unhappy
son
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
touch
you
,
then
;
let
me
feel
if
you
are
really
flesh
and
blood
,
"
cried
the
poor
maniac
,
creeping
towards
him
on
all
fours
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
did
not
advance
to
meet
her
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
move
;
but
stood
like
one
stupified
,
with
his
hands
clasped
together
,
and
eyes
almost
starting
out
of
their
sockets
,
fixed
upon
his
unfortunate
parent
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
to
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
poor
maniac
,
who
had
crawled
as
far
as
the
chain
would
permit
her,--"come
to
me
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
extending
her
thin
arm
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
fell
on
his
knees
beside
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
are
you
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
passing
her
hands
over
his
face
,
and
gazing
at
him
with
a
look
that
made
him
shudder
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
son
,
"
replied
Jack,--"your
miserable
,
repentant
son
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
false
,
"
cried
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
.
<EOS>
Jack
was
not
half
your
age
when
he
died
.
<EOS>
They
buried
him
in
Willesden
churchyard
after
the
robbery
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
God
!
"
cried
Jack
,
"
she
does
not
know
me
.
<EOS>
Mother
--
dear
mother
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
clasping
her
in
his
arms
,
"
<EOS>
Look
at
me
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Off
!
<EOS>
"
she
exclaimed
,
breaking
from
his
embrace
with
a
scream
.
"
Do
n't
touch
me
.
<EOS>
I
'll
be
quiet
.
<EOS>
I
'll
not
speak
of
Jack
or
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
dig
their
graves
with
my
nails
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
strip
me
quite
.
<EOS>
Leave
me
my
blanket
!
<EOS>
I
'm
very
cold
at
night
.
<EOS>
Or
,
if
you
must
take
off
my
clothes
,
do
n't
dash
cold
water
on
my
head
.
<EOS>
It
throbs
cruelly
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Horror
!
"
cried
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
scourge
me
,
"
she
cried
,
trying
to
hide
herself
in
the
farthest
corner
of
the
cell
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
lash
cuts
to
the
bone
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
bear
it
.
<EOS>
Spare
me
,
and
I
'll
be
quiet
--
<EOS>
quiet
--
quiet
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mother
!
<EOS>
"
said
Jack
,
advancing
towards
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Off
!
<EOS>
"
she
cried
with
a
prolonged
and
piercing
shriek
.
<EOS>
And
she
buried
herself
beneath
the
straw
,
which
she
tossed
above
her
head
with
the
wildest
gestures
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
kill
her
if
I
stay
longer
,
"
muttered
her
son
,
completely
terrified
.
 
<EOS>
While
he
was
considering
what
would
be
best
to
do
,
the
poor
maniac
,
over
whose
bewildered
brain
another
change
had
come
,
raised
her
head
from
under
the
straw
,
and
peeping
round
the
room
,
asked
in
a
low
voice
,
"
If
they
were
gone
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Who
?
"
inquired
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
nurses
,
"
she
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
they
treat
you
ill
?
"
<EOS>
asked
her
son
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
putting
her
lean
fingers
to
her
lips
.
"
<EOS>
Hush!--come
hither
,
and
I
'll
tell
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
Jack
approached
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sit
beside
me
,
"
continued
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
,
now
I
'll
tell
you
what
they
do
.
<EOS>
Stop
!
<EOS>
we
must
shut
the
door
,
or
they
'll
catch
us
.
<EOS>
See
!
"
<EOS>
she
added
,
tearing
the
rag
from
her
head,--"I
<EOS>
had
beautiful
black
hair
once
.
<EOS>
But
they
cut
it
all
off
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
go
mad
myself
if
I
listen
to
her
longer
,
"
said
Jack
,
attempting
to
rise
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
stir
,
or
they
'll
chain
you
to
the
wall
,
"
said
his
mother
detaining
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Now
,
tell
me
why
they
brought
you
here
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
came
to
see
you
,
dear
mother
!
"
<EOS>
answered
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mother
!
"
<EOS>
she
echoed,--"mother
!
<EOS>
why
do
you
call
me
by
that
name
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Because
you
are
my
mother
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
staring
eagerly
in
his
face
.
"
<EOS>
Are
you
my
son
?
<EOS>
Are
you
Jack
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
,
"
replied
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
Heaven
be
praised
she
knows
me
at
last
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Jack
!
"
cried
his
mother
,
falling
upon
his
neck
,
and
covering
him
with
kisses
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mother
--
dear
mother
!
"
said
Jack
,
bursting
into
tears
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
never
leave
me
,
"
sobbed
the
poor
woman
,
straining
him
to
her
breast
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
--
never
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
words
were
scarcely
pronounced
,
when
the
door
was
violently
thrown
open
,
and
two
men
appeared
at
it
.
<EOS>
They
were
Jonathan
Wild
and
Quilt
Arnold
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
exclaimed
Jack
,
starting
to
his
feet
.
 
<EOS>
"
Just
in
time
,
"
said
the
thief
-
taker
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
my
prisoner
,
Jack
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
take
my
life
first
,
"
rejoined
Sheppard
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
as
he
was
about
to
put
himself
into
a
posture
of
defence
,
his
mother
clasped
him
in
her
arms
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
shall
not
harm
you
,
my
love
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
.
 
<EOS>
The
movement
was
fatal
to
her
son
.
<EOS>
Taking
advantage
of
his
embarrassed
position
,
Jonathan
and
his
assistant
rushed
upon
him
,
and
disarmed
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
"
cried
the
thief
-
taker
,
as
he
slipped
a
pair
of
handcuffs
over
Jack
's
wrists
,
"
for
the
help
you
have
given
us
in
capturing
your
son
.
<EOS>
Without
you
,
we
might
have
had
some
trouble
.
"
 
<EOS>
Aware
apparently
in
some
degree
,
of
the
mistake
she
had
committed
,
the
poor
maniac
sprang
towards
him
with
frantic
violence
,
and
planted
her
long
nails
in
his
cheek
.
 
<EOS>
"
Keep
off
,
you
accursed
jade
!
"
<EOS>
roared
Jonathan
,
"
--off
,
I
say
,
or--
"
<EOS>
And
he
struck
her
a
violent
blow
with
his
clenched
hand
.
 
<EOS>
The
miserable
woman
staggered
,
uttered
a
deep
groan
,
and
fell
senseless
on
the
straw
.
 
<EOS>
"
Devil
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jack
;
"
that
blow
shall
cost
you
your
life
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
'll
not
need
to
be
repeated
,
at
all
events
,
"
rejoined
Jonathan
,
looking
with
a
smile
of
malignant
satisfaction
at
the
body
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
now,--to
Newgate
.
"
    
CHAPTER
IX
.
 
<EOS>
Old
Newgate
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
beginning
of
the
twelfth
century,--whether
in
the
reign
of
Henry
the
First
,
or
Stephen
is
uncertain,--a
fifth
gate
was
added
to
the
four
principal
entrances
of
the
city
of
London
;
then
,
it
is
almost
needless
to
say
,
surrounded
by
ramparts
,
moats
,
and
other
defences
.
<EOS>
This
gate
,
called
_
Newgate
_
,
"
as
being
latelier
builded
than
the
rest
,
"
continued
,
for
upwards
of
three
hundred
years
,
to
be
used
as
a
place
of
imprisonment
for
felons
and
trespassers
;
at
the
end
of
which
time
,
having
grown
old
,
ruinous
,
and
"
horribly
loathsome
,
"
it
was
rebuilt
and
enlarged
by
the
executors
of
the
renowned
Sir
Richard
Whittington
,
the
Lord
Mayor
of
London
:
whence
<EOS>
it
afterwards
obtained
amongst
a
certain
class
of
students
,
whose
examinations
were
conducted
with
some
strictness
at
the
Old
Bailey
,
and
their
highest
degrees
taken
at
Hyde
-
park
-
corner
,
the
appellation
of
Whittington
's
College
,
or
,
more
briefly
,
the
Whit
.
<EOS>
It
may
here
be
mentioned
that
this
gate
,
destined
to
bequeath
its
name
--
a
name
,
which
has
since
acquired
a
terrible
significance,--to
every
successive
structure
erected
upon
its
site
,
was
granted
,
in
1400
,
by
charter
by
Henry
the
Sixth
to
the
citizens
of
London
,
in
return
for
their
royal
services
,
and
thenceforth
became
the
common
jail
to
that
city
and
the
county
of
Middlesex
.
<EOS>
Nothing
material
occurred
to
Newgate
,
until
the
memorable
year
1666
,
when
it
was
utterly
destroyed
by
the
Great
Fire
.
<EOS>
It
is
with
the
building
raised
after
this
direful
calamity
that
our
history
has
to
deal
.
 
<EOS>
Though
by
no
means
so
extensive
or
commodious
as
the
modern
prison
,
Old
Newgate
was
a
large
and
strongly
-
built
pile
.
<EOS>
The
body
of
the
edifice
stood
on
the
south
side
of
Newgate
Street
,
and
projected
at
the
western
extremity
far
into
the
area
opposite
Saint
Sepulchre
's
Church
.
<EOS>
One
small
wing
lay
at
the
north
of
the
gate
,
where
Giltspur
Street
Compter
now
stands
;
and
the
Press
Yard
,
which
was
detached
from
the
main
building
,
was
situated
at
the
back
of
Phoenix
Court
.
<EOS>
The
south
or
principal
front
,
looking
,
_
down
_
the
Old
Bailey
,
and
not
_
upon
it
<EOS>
_
,
as
is
the
case
of
the
present
structure
,
with
its
massive
walls
of
roughened
freestone,--in
<EOS>
some
places
darkened
by
the
smoke
,
in
others
blanched
,
by
exposure
to
the
weather,--its
heavy
projecting
cornice
,
its
unglazed
doubly
-
grated
windows
,
its
gloomy
porch
decorated
with
fetters
,
and
defended
by
an
enormous
iron
door
,
had
a
stern
and
striking
effect
.
<EOS>
Over
the
Lodge
,
upon
a
dial
was
inscribed
the
appropriate
motto
,
"
_
Venio
sicut
fur
_
.
"
<EOS>
The
Gate
,
which
crossed
Newgate
Street
,
had
a
wide
arch
for
carriages
,
and
a
postern
,
on
the
north
side
,
for
foot
-
passengers
.
<EOS>
Its
architecture
was
richly
ornamental
,
and
resembled
the
style
of
a
triumphal
entrance
to
a
capital
,
rather
than
a
dungeon
having
battlements
and
hexagonal
towers
,
and
being
adorned
on
the
western
side
with
a
triple
range
of
pilasters
of
the
Tuscan
order
,
amid
the
intercolumniations
of
which
were
niches
embellished
with
statues
.
<EOS>
The
chief
of
these
was
a
figure
of
Liberty
,
with
a
cat
at
her
feet
,
in
allusion
to
the
supposed
origin
of
the
fortunes
of
its
former
founder
,
Sir
Richard
Whittington
.
<EOS>
On
the
right
of
the
postern
against
the
wall
was
affixed
a
small
grating
,
sustaining
the
debtor
's
box
;
and
any
pleasure
which
the
passer
-
by
might
derive
from
contemplating
the
splendid
structure
above
described
was
damped
at
beholding
the
pale
faces
and
squalid
figures
of
the
captives
across
the
bars
of
its
strongly
-
grated
windows
.
<EOS>
Some
years
after
the
date
of
this
history
,
an
immense
ventilator
was
placed
at
the
top
of
the
Gate
,
with
the
view
of
purifying
the
prison
,
which
,
owing
to
its
insufficient
space
and
constantly
-
crowded
state
,
was
never
free
from
that
dreadful
and
contagious
disorder
,
now
happily
unknown
,
the
jail
-
fever
.
<EOS>
So
frightful
,
indeed
,
were
the
ravages
of
this
malady
,
to
which
debtors
and
felons
were
alike
exposed
,
that
its
miserable
victims
were
frequently
carried
out
by
cart
-
loads
,
and
thrown
into
a
pit
in
the
burial
-
ground
of
Christ
-
church
,
without
ceremony
.
 
<EOS>
Old
Newgate
was
divided
into
three
separate
prisons,--the
Master
's
Side
,
the
Common
Side
,
and
the
Press
Yard
.
<EOS>
The
first
of
these
,
situated
a
the
south
of
the
building
,
with
the
exception
of
one
ward
over
the
gateway
,
was
allotted
to
the
better
class
of
debtors
,
whose
funds
enabled
them
to
defray
their
chamber
-
rent
,
fees
,
and
garnish
.
<EOS>
The
second
,
comprising
the
bulk
of
the
jail
,
and
by
many
degrees
worse
in
point
of
accommodation
,
having
several
dismal
and
noisome
wards
under
ground
,
was
common
both
to
debtors
and
malefactors,--an
association
little
favourable
to
the
morals
or
comforts
of
the
former
,
who
,
if
they
were
brought
there
with
any
notions
of
honesty
,
seldom
left
with
untainted
principles
.
<EOS>
The
last,--in
all
respects
the
best
and
airiest
of
the
three
,
standing
,
as
has
been
before
observed
,
in
Phoenix
Court
,
at
the
rear
of
the
main
fabric,--was
<EOS>
reserved
for
state
-
offenders
,
and
such
persons
as
chose
to
submit
to
the
extortionate
demands
of
the
keeper
:
from
twenty
to
five
hundred
pounds
premium
,
according
to
the
rank
and
means
of
the
applicant
,
in
addition
to
a
high
weekly
rent
,
being
required
for
accommodation
in
this
quarter
.
<EOS>
Some
excuse
for
this
rapacity
may
perhaps
be
found
in
the
fact
,
that
five
thousand
pounds
was
paid
for
the
purchase
of
the
Press
Yard
by
Mr.
Pitt
,
the
then
governor
of
Newgate
.
<EOS>
This
gentleman
,
tried
for
high
treason
,
in
1716
,
on
suspicion
of
aiding
Mr.
Forster
,
the
rebel
general
's
escape
,
but
acquitted
,
reaped
a
golden
harvest
during
the
occupation
of
his
premises
by
the
Preston
rebels
,
when
a
larger
sum
was
obtained
for
a
single
chamber
than
(
in
the
words
of
a
sufferer
on
the
occasion
)
"
would
have
paid
the
rent
of
the
best
house
in
Saint
James
's
Square
or
Piccadilly
for
several
years
.
"
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
this
all
.
<EOS>
Other
,
and
more
serious
impositions
,
inasmuch
as
they
affected
a
poorer
class
of
persons
,
were
practised
by
the
underlings
of
the
jail
.
<EOS>
On
his
first
entrance
,
a
prisoner
,
if
unable
or
unwilling
to
comply
with
the
exactions
of
the
turnkeys
,
was
thrust
into
the
Condemned
Hold
with
the
worst
description
of
criminals
,
and
terrified
by
threats
into
submission
.
<EOS>
By
the
old
regulations
,
the
free
use
of
strong
liquors
not
being
interdicted
,
a
tap
-
house
was
kept
in
the
Lodge
,
and
also
in
a
cellar
on
the
Common
Side,--under
the
superintendence
of
Mrs.
Spurling
,
formerly
,
it
may
be
remembered
,
the
hostess
of
the
Dark
House
at
Queenhithe,--whence
wine
,
ale
,
and
brandy
of
inferior
quality
were
dispensed
,
in
false
measures
,
and
at
high
prices
,
throughout
the
prison
,
which
in
noise
and
debauchery
rivalled
,
if
it
did
not
surpass
,
the
lowest
tavern
.
 
<EOS>
The
chief
scene
of
these
disgusting
orgies,--the
cellar
,
just
referred
to,--was
a
large
low
-
roofed
vault
,
about
four
feet
below
the
level
of
the
street
,
perfectly
dark
,
unless
when
illumined
by
a
roaring
fire
,
and
candles
stuck
in
pyramidal
lumps
of
clay
,
with
a
range
of
butts
and
barrels
at
one
end
,
and
benches
and
tables
at
the
other
,
where
the
prisoners
,
debtors
,
and
malefactors
male
and
female
,
assembled
as
long
as
their
money
lasted
,
and
consumed
the
time
in
drinking
,
smoking
,
and
gaming
with
cards
and
dice
.
<EOS>
Above
was
a
spacious
hall
,
connected
with
it
by
a
flight
of
stone
steps
,
<EOS>
at
the
further
end
of
which
stood
an
immense
grated
door
,
called
in
the
slang
of
the
place
"
The
Jigger
,
"
through
the
bars
of
which
the
felons
in
the
upper
wards
were
allowed
to
converse
with
their
friends
,
or
if
they
wished
to
enter
the
room
,
or
join
the
revellers
below
,
they
were
at
liberty
to
do
so
,
on
payment
of
a
small
fine
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
the
same
system
of
plunder
was
everywhere
carried
on
.
<EOS>
The
jailers
robbed
the
prisoners
:
the
prisoners
robbed
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
Two
large
wards
were
situated
in
the
Gate
;
one
of
which
,
the
Stone
Ward
,
appropriated
to
the
master
debtors
,
looked
towards
Holborn
;
the
other
called
the
Stone
Hall
,
from
a
huge
stone
standing
in
the
middle
of
it
,
upon
which
the
irons
of
criminals
under
sentence
of
death
were
knocked
off
previously
to
their
being
taken
to
the
place
of
execution
,
faced
Newgate
Street
.
<EOS>
Here
the
prisoners
took
exercise
;
and
a
quaint
,
but
striking
picture
has
been
left
of
their
appearance
when
so
engaged
,
by
the
author
of
the
English
Rogue
.
<EOS>
"
At
my
first
being
acquainted
with
the
place
,
"
says
this
writer
,
in
the
'
Miseries
of
a
Prison
,
'
"
the
prisoners
,
methought
,
walking
up
and
down
the
Stone
Hall
,
looked
like
so
many
wrecks
upon
the
sea
.
<EOS>
Here
the
ribs
of
a
thousand
pounds
beating
against
the
Needles
--
those
dangerous
rocks
,
credulity
here
floated
,
to
and
fro
,
silks
,
stuffs
,
camlets
,
and
velvet
,
without
giving
place
to
each
other
,
according
to
their
dignity
;
here
rolled
so
many
pipes
of
canary
,
whose
bungholes
lying
open
,
were
so
damaged
that
the
merchant
may
go
hoop
for
his
money
,
"
<EOS>
A
less
picturesque
,
but
more
truthful
,
and
,
therefore
,
more
melancholy
description
of
the
same
scene
,
is
furnished
by
the
shrewd
and
satirical
Ned
Ward
,
who
informs
us
,
in
the
"
Delectable
History
of
Whittington
's
College
,
"
that
"
When
the
prisoners
are
disposed
to
recreate
themselves
with
walking
,
they
go
up
into
a
spacious
room
,
called
the
Stone
Hall
;
where
,
when
you
see
them
taking
a
turn
together
,
it
would
puzzle
one
to
know
which
is
the
gentleman
,
which
the
mechanic
,
and
which
the
beggar
,
for
they
are
all
suited
in
the
same
garb
of
squalid
poverty
,
making
a
spectacle
of
more
pity
than
executions
;
only
to
be
out
at
the
elbows
is
in
fashion
here
,
and
a
great
indecorum
not
to
be
threadbare
.
"
 
<EOS>
In
an
angle
of
the
Stone
Hall
was
the
Iron
Hold
,
a
chamber
containing
a
vast
assortment
of
fetters
and
handcuffs
of
all
weights
and
sizes
.
<EOS>
Four
prisoners
,
termed
"
The
Partners
,
"
had
charge
of
this
hold
.
<EOS>
Their
duty
was
to
see
who
came
in
,
or
went
out
;
to
lock
up
,
and
open
the
different
wards
;
to
fetter
such
prisoners
as
were
ordered
to
be
placed
in
irons
;
to
distribute
the
allowances
of
provision
;
and
to
maintain
some
show
of
decorum
;
for
which
latter
purpose
they
were
allowed
to
carry
whips
and
truncheons
.
<EOS>
When
any
violent
outrage
was
committed,--and
<EOS>
such
matters
were
of
daily
,
sometimes
hourly
,
occurrence,--a
bell
,
the
rope
of
which
descended
into
the
hall
,
brought
the
whole
of
the
turnkeys
to
their
assistance
.
<EOS>
A
narrow
passage
at
the
north
of
the
Stone
Hall
led
to
the
Bluebeard
's
room
of
this
enchanted
castle
,
a
place
shunned
even
by
the
reckless
crew
who
were
compelled
to
pass
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
sort
of
cooking
-
room
,
with
an
immense
fire
-
place
flanked
by
a
couple
of
cauldrons
,
and
was
called
Jack
Ketch
's
Kitchen
,
because
the
quarters
of
persons
executed
for
treason
were
there
boiled
by
the
hangman
in
oil
,
pitch
,
and
tar
,
before
they
were
affixed
on
the
city
gates
,
or
on
London
Bridge
.
<EOS>
Above
this
revolting
spot
was
the
female
debtor
's
ward
;
below
it
a
gloomy
cell
,
called
Tangier
;
and
,
lower
still
,
the
Stone
Hold
,
a
most
terrible
and
noisome
dungeon
,
situated
underground
,
and
unvisited
by
a
single
ray
of
daylight
.
<EOS>
Built
and
paved
with
stone
,
without
beds
,
or
any
other
sort
of
protection
from
the
cold
,
this
dreadful
hole
,
accounted
the
most
dark
and
dismal
in
the
prison
,
was
made
the
receptacle
of
such
miserable
wretches
as
could
not
pay
the
customary
fees
.
<EOS>
Adjoining
it
was
the
Lower
<EOS>
Ward,--"Though
,
in
what
degree
of
latitude
it
was
situated
,
"
observes
Ned
Ward
,
"
I
can
not
positively
demonstrate
,
unless
it
lay
ninety
degrees
beyond
the
North
Pole
;
for
,
instead
of
being
dark
there
<EOS>
but
half
a
year
,
it
is
dark
all
the
year
round
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
only
a
shade
better
than
the
Stone
Hold
.
<EOS>
Here
were
imprisoned
the
fines
;
and
,
"
perhaps
,
"
adds
the
before
-
cited
authority
,
"
if
he
behaved
himself
,
an
outlawed
person
might
creep
in
among
them
.
"
<EOS>
Ascending
the
gate
once
more
on
the
way
back
,
we
find
over
the
Stone
Hall
another
large
room
,
called
Debtors
'
Hall
,
facing
Newgate
Street
,
with
"
very
good
air
and
light
.
"
<EOS>
A
little
too
much
of
the
former
,
perhaps
;
as
the
windows
being
unglazed
,
the
prisoners
were
subjected
to
severe
annoyance
from
the
weather
and
easterly
winds
.
 
<EOS>
Of
the
women
felons
'
rooms
nothing
has
yet
been
said
.
<EOS>
There
were
two
.
<EOS>
One
called
Waterman
's
Hall
,
a
horrible
place
adjoining
the
postern
under
the
gate
,
whence
,
through
a
small
barred
aperture
,
they
solicited
alms
from
the
passengers
:
<EOS>
the
other
,
a
large
chamber
,
denominated
My
Lady
's
Hold
,
was
situated
in
the
highest
part
of
the
jail
,
at
the
northern
extremity
.
<EOS>
Neither
of
these
wards
had
beds
,
and
the
unfortunate
inmates
were
obliged
to
take
their
rest
on
the
oaken
floor
.
<EOS>
The
condition
of
the
rooms
was
indescribably
filthy
and
disgusting
;
nor
were
the
habits
of
the
occupants
much
more
cleanly
.
<EOS>
In
other
respects
,
they
were
equally
indecorous
and
offensive
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
is
with
no
small
concern
,
"
writes
an
anonymous
historian
of
Newgate
,
"
that
I
am
obliged
to
observe
that
the
women
in
every
ward
of
this
prison
are
exceedingly
worse
than
the
worst
of
the
men
not
only
in
respect
to
their
mode
of
living
,
but
more
especially
as
to
their
conversation
,
which
,
to
their
great
shame
,
is
as
profane
and
wicked
as
hell
itself
can
possibly
be
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
There
were
two
Condemned
Holds,--one
for
each
sex
.
<EOS>
That
for
the
men
lay
near
the
Lodge
,
with
which
it
was
connected
by
a
dark
passage
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
large
room
,
about
twenty
feet
long
and
fifteen
broad
,
and
had
an
arched
stone
roof
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
it
had
been
anciently
the
right
hand
postern
under
the
gate
leading
towards
the
city
.
<EOS>
The
floor
was
planked
with
oak
,
and
covered
with
iron
staples
,
hooks
,
and
ring
-
bolts
,
with
heavy
chains
attached
to
them
.
<EOS>
There
was
only
one
small
grated
window
in
this
hold
,
which
admitted
but
little
light
.
 
<EOS>
Over
the
gateway
towards
Snow
Hill
,
were
two
strong
wards
,
called
the
Castle
and
the
Red
Room
.
<EOS>
They
will
claim
particular
attention
hereafter
.
 
<EOS>
Many
other
wards,--especially
on
the
Master
Debtor
's
side,--have
been
necessarily
omitted
in
the
foregoing
hasty
enumeration
.
<EOS>
But
there
were
two
places
of
punishment
which
merit
some
notice
from
their
peculiarity
.
<EOS>
The
first
of
these
,
the
Press
Room
,
a
dark
close
chamber
,
near
Waterman
's
Hall
,
obtained
its
name
from
an
immense
wooden
machine
kept
in
it
,
with
which
such
prisoners
as
refused
to
plead
to
their
indictments
were
pressed
to
death
--
<EOS>
a
species
of
inquisitorial
torture
not
discontinued
until
so
lately
as
the
early
part
of
the
reign
of
George
the
Third
,
when
it
was
abolished
by
an
express
statute
.
<EOS>
Into
the
second
,
denominated
the
Bilbowes,--also
a
dismal
place,--refractory
prisoners
were
thrust
,
and
placed
in
a
kind
of
stocks
,
whence
the
name
.
 
<EOS>
The
Chapel
was
situated
in
the
south
-
east
angle
of
the
jail
;
the
ordinary
at
the
time
of
this
history
being
the
Reverend
Thomas
Purney
;
the
deputy
chaplain
,
Mr.
Wagstaff
.
 
<EOS>
Much
has
been
advanced
by
modern
writers
respecting
the
demoralising
effect
of
prison
society
;
and
it
has
been
asserted
,
that
a
youth
once
confined
in
Newgate
,
is
certain
to
come
out
a
confirmed
thief
.
<EOS>
However
this
may
be
now
,
it
was
unquestionably
true
of
old
Newgate
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
grand
nursery
of
vice.--"A
famous
university
,
"
observes
Ned
Ward
,
in
the
London
Spy
,
"
where
,
if
a
man
has
a
mind
to
educate
a
hopeful
child
in
the
daring
science
of
padding
;
the
light
-
fingered
subtlety
of
shoplifting
:
the
excellent
use
of
jack
and
crow
;
for
the
silently
drawing
bolts
,
and
forcing
barricades
;
with
the
knack
of
sweetening
;
or
the
most
ingenious
dexterity
of
picking
pockets
;
let
him
but
enter
in
this
college
on
the
Common
Side
,
and
confine
him
close
to
his
study
<EOS>
but
for
three
months
;
and
if
he
does
not
come
out
qualified
to
take
any
degree
of
villainy
,
he
must
be
the
most
honest
dunce
that
ever
had
the
advantage
of
such
eminent
tutors
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
To
bring
down
this
imperfect
sketch
of
Newgate
to
the
present
time
,
it
may
be
mentioned
,
that
,
being
found
inadequate
to
the
purpose
required
,
the
old
jail
was
pulled
down
in
1770
.
<EOS>
Just
at
the
completion
of
the
new
jail
,
in
1780
,
it
was
assailed
by
the
mob
during
the
Gordon
riots
,
fired
,
and
greatly
damaged
.
<EOS>
The
devastations
,
however
,
were
speedily
made
good
,
and
,
in
two
years
more
,
it
was
finished
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
cheering
reflection
,
that
in
the
present
prison
,
with
its
clean
,
well
-
whitewashed
,
and
well
-
ventilated
wards
,
its
airy
courts
,
its
infirmary
,
its
improved
regulations
,
and
its
humane
and
intelligent
officers
,
many
of
the
miseries
of
the
old
jail
are
removed
.
<EOS>
For
these
beneficial
changes
society
is
mainly
indebted
to
the
unremitting
exertions
of
the
philanthropic
HOWARD
.

CHAPTER
X.
 
<EOS>
How
Jack
Sheppard
got
out
of
the
Condemned
Hold
.
  
<EOS>
Monday
,
the
31st
of
August
1724,--a
day
long
afterwards
remembered
by
the
officers
of
Newgate,--was
distinguished
by
an
unusual
influx
of
visitors
to
the
Lodge
.
<EOS>
On
that
morning
the
death
warrant
had
arrived
from
Windsor
,
ordering
Sheppard
for
execution
,
(
since
his
capture
by
Jonathan
Wild
in
Bedlam
,
as
related
in
a
former
chapter
,
Jack
had
been
tried
,
convicted
,
and
sentenced
to
death
,
)
together
with
three
other
malefactors
on
the
following
Friday
.
<EOS>
Up
to
this
moment
,
hopes
had
been
entertained
of
a
respite
,
strong
representations
in
his
favour
having
been
made
in
the
highest
quarter
;
but
now
that
his
fate
seemed
sealed
,
the
curiosity
of
the
sight
-
seeing
public
to
behold
him
was
redoubled
.
<EOS>
The
prison
gates
were
besieged
like
the
entrance
of
a
booth
at
a
fair
;
and
the
Condemned
Hold
where
he
was
confined
,
and
to
which
visitors
were
admitted
at
the
moderate
rate
of
a
guinea
a
-
head
,
had
quite
the
appearance
of
a
showroom
.
<EOS>
As
the
day
wore
on
,
the
crowds
diminished,--many
who
would
not
submit
to
the
turnkey
's
demands
were
sent
away
ungratified,--and
at
five
o'clock
,
only
two
strangers
,
Mr.
Shotbolt
,
the
head
turnkey
of
Clerkenwell
Prison
,
and
Mr.
Griffin
,
who
held
the
same
office
in
Westminster
Gatehouse
were
left
in
the
Lodge
.
<EOS>
Jack
,
who
had
formerly
been
in
the
custody
of
both
these
gentlemen
,
gave
them
a
very
cordial
welcome
;
apologized
for
the
sorry
room
he
was
compelled
to
receive
them
in
;
and
when
they
took
leave
,
insisted
on
treating
them
to
a
double
bowl
of
punch
,
which
they
were
now
discussing
with
the
upper
jailer
,
Mr.
Ireton
,
and
his
two
satellites
,
Austin
and
Langley
.
<EOS>
At
a
little
distance
from
the
party
,
sat
a
tall
,
sinister
-
looking
personage
,
with
harsh
inflexible
features
,
a
gaunt
but
muscular
frame
,
and
large
bony
hands
.
<EOS>
He
was
sipping
a
glass
of
cold
gin
and
water
,
and
smoking
a
short
black
pipe
.
<EOS>
His
name
was
Marvel
,
and
his
avocation
,
which
was
as
repulsive
as
his
looks
,
was
that
of
public
executioner
.
<EOS>
By
his
side
sat
a
remarkably
stout
dame
,
to
whom
he
paid
as
much
attention
as
it
was
in
his
iron
nature
to
pay
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
nut
-
brown
skin
,
a
swarthy
upper
lip
,
a
merry
black
eye
,
a
prominent
bust
,
and
a
tun
-
like
circumference
of
waist
.
<EOS>
A
widow
for
the
fourth
time
,
Mrs.
Spurling
,
(
for
she
it
was
,
)
either
by
her
attractions
of
purse
or
person
,
had
succeeded
in
moving
the
stony
heart
of
Mr.
Marvel
,
who
,
as
he
had
helped
to
deprive
her
of
her
former
husbands
,
thought
himself
in
duty
bound
to
offer
to
supply
their
place
.
<EOS>
But
the
lady
was
not
so
easily
won
;
and
though
she
did
not
absolutely
reject
him
,
gave
him
very
slight
hopes
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Marvel
,
therefore
,
remained
on
his
probation
.
<EOS>
Behind
Mrs.
Spurling
stood
her
negro
attendant
,
Caliban
;
a
hideous
,
misshapen
,
malicious
monster
,
with
broad
hunched
shoulders
,
a
flat
nose
,
and
ears
like
those
of
a
wild
beast
,
a
head
too
large
for
his
body
,
and
a
body
too
long
for
his
legs
.
<EOS>
This
horrible
piece
of
deformity
,
who
acted
as
drawer
and
cellarman
,
and
was
a
constant
butt
to
the
small
wits
of
the
jail
,
was
nicknamed
the
Black
Dog
of
Newgate
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
general
survey
of
the
prison
,
taken
in
the
preceding
chapter
,
but
little
was
said
of
the
Lodge
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
well
,
therefore
,
before
proceeding
farther
,
to
describe
it
more
minutely
.
<EOS>
It
was
approached
from
the
street
by
a
flight
of
broad
stone
steps
,
leading
to
a
ponderous
door
,
plated
with
iron
,
and
secured
on
the
inner
side
by
huge
bolts
,
and
a
lock
,
with
wards
of
a
prodigious
size
.
<EOS>
A
little
within
stood
a
second
door
,
or
rather
wicket
,
lower
than
the
first
,
but
of
equal
strength
,
and
surmounted
by
a
row
of
sharp
spikes
.
<EOS>
As
no
apprehension
was
entertained
of
an
escape
by
this
outlet,--nothing
of
the
kind
having
been
attempted
by
the
boldest
felon
ever
incarcerated
in
Newgate,--both
doors
were
generally
left
open
during
the
daytime
.
<EOS>
At
six
o'clock
,
the
wicket
was
shut
;
and
at
nine
,
the
jail
was
altogether
locked
up
.
<EOS>
Not
far
from
the
entrance
,
on
the
left
,
was
a
sort
of
screen
,
or
partition
-
wall
,
reaching
from
the
floor
to
the
ceiling
,
formed
of
thick
oaken
planks
riveted
together
by
iron
bolts
,
and
studded
with
broad
-
headed
nails
.
<EOS>
In
this
screen
,
which
masked
the
entrance
of
a
dark
passage
communicating
with
the
Condemned
Hold
,
about
five
feet
from
the
ground
,
was
a
hatch
,
protected
by
long
spikes
set
six
inches
apart
,
and
each
of
the
thickness
of
an
elephant
's
tusk
.
<EOS>
The
spikes
almost
touched
the
upper
part
of
the
hatch
:
scarcely
space
enough
for
the
passage
of
a
hand
being
left
between
their
points
and
the
beam
.
<EOS>
Here
,
as
has
already
been
observed
,
condemned
malefactors
were
allowed
to
converse
with
such
of
their
guests
as
had
not
interest
or
money
enough
to
procure
admission
to
them
in
the
hold
.
<EOS>
Beyond
the
hatch
,
an
angle
,
formed
by
a
projection
in
the
wall
of
some
three
or
four
feet
,
served
to
hide
a
door
conducting
to
the
interior
of
the
prison
.
<EOS>
At
the
farther
end
of
the
Lodge
,
the
floor
was
raised
to
the
height
of
a
couple
of
steps
;
whence
the
whole
place
,
with
the
exception
of
the
remotest
corner
of
the
angle
before
-
mentioned
,
could
be
commanded
at
a
single
glance
.
<EOS>
On
this
elevation
a
table
was
now
placed
,
around
which
sat
the
turnkeys
and
their
guests
,
regaling
themselves
on
the
fragrant
beverage
provided
by
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
A
brief
description
will
suffice
for
them
.
<EOS>
They
were
all
stout
ill
-
favoured
men
,
attired
in
the
regular
jail
-
livery
of
scratch
wig
and
snuff
-
coloured
suit
;
and
had
all
a
strong
family
likeness
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
The
only
difference
between
the
officers
of
Newgate
and
their
brethren
was
,
that
they
had
enormous
bunches
of
keys
at
their
girdles
,
while
the
latter
had
left
their
keys
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
've
seen
many
a
gallant
fellow
in
my
time
,
Mr.
Ireton
,
"
observed
the
chief
turnkey
of
Westminster
Gatehouse
,
as
he
helped
himself
to
his
third
glass
of
punch
;
"
but
I
never
saw
one
like
Jack
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nor
I
,
"
returned
Ireton
,
following
his
example
:
"
and
I
've
had
some
experience
too
.
<EOS>
Ever
since
he
came
here
,
three
months
ago
,
he
has
been
the
life
and
soul
of
the
place
;
and
now
the
death
warrant
has
arrived
,
instead
of
being
cast
down
,
as
most
men
would
be
,
and
as
all
others
_
are
_
,
he
's
gayer
than
ever
.
<EOS>
Well
,
_
I
_
shall
be
sorry
to
lose
him
,
Mr.
Griffin
.
<EOS>
We
've
made
a
pretty
penny
by
him
--
<EOS>
sixty
guineas
this
blessed
day
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
more
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Griffin
,
incredulously
;
"
I
should
have
thought
you
must
have
made
double
that
sum
at
least
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
a
farthing
more
,
I
assure
you
,
"
rejoined
Ireton
,
pettishly
;
"
we
're
all
on
the
square
here
.
<EOS>
I
took
the
money
myself
,
and
_
ought
_
to
know
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
certainly
,
"
answered
Griffin
;
"
certainly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
offered
Jack
five
guineas
as
his
share
,
"
continued
Ireton
;
"
but
he
would
n't
take
it
himself
,
and
gave
it
to
the
poor
debtors
and
felons
,
who
are
now
drinking
it
out
in
the
cellar
on
the
Common
Side
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Jack
's
a
noble
fellow
,
"
exclaimed
the
head
-
jailer
of
Clerkenwell
Prison
,
raising
his
glass
;
"
and
,
though
he
played
me
a
scurvy
trick
,
I
'll
drink
to
his
speedy
deliverance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
At
Tyburn
,
eh
,
Mr.
Shotbolt
?
"
rejoined
the
executioner
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
pledge
you
in
that
toast
with
all
my
heart
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
for
my
part
,
"
observed
Mrs.
Spurling
,
"
<EOS>
I
hope
he
may
never
see
Tyburn
.
<EOS>
And
,
if
I
'd
my
own
way
with
the
Secretary
of
State
,
he
never
_
should
_
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
thousand
pities
to
hang
so
pretty
a
fellow
.
<EOS>
There
have
n't
been
so
many
ladies
in
the
Lodge
since
the
days
of
Claude
Du
Val
,
the
gentleman
highwayman
;
and
they
all
declare
it
'll
break
their
hearts
if
he
's
scragged
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Bah
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Marvel
,
gruffly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
think
our
sex
has
no
feeling
,
I
suppose
,
Sir
,
"
cried
Mrs.
Spurling
,
indignantly
;
"
but
I
can
tell
you
we
have
.
<EOS>
And
,
what
's
more
,
I
tell
you
,
if
Captain
Sheppard
_
is
_
hanged
,
you
need
never
hope
to
call
_
me
_
Mrs.
Marvel
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
'
Zounds
!
"
cried
the
executioner
,
in
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
know
what
you
are
talking
about
,
Mrs.
Spurling
?
<EOS>
Why
,
if
Captain
Sheppard
should
get
off
,
it
'
ud
be
fifty
guineas
out
of
my
way
.
<EOS>
There
's
the
grand
laced
coat
he
wore
at
his
trial
,
which
I
intend
for
my
wedding
-
dress
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
mention
such
a
thing
,
Sir
,
"
interrupted
the
tapstress
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
bear
to
see
you
in
it
.
<EOS>
Your
speaking
of
the
trial
brings
the
whole
scene
to
my
mind
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
shall
never
forget
the
figure
Jack
cut
on
that
occasion
.
<EOS>
What
a
buzz
of
admiration
ran
round
the
court
as
he
appeared
!
<EOS>
And
,
how
handsome
and
composed
he
looked
!
<EOS>
Everybody
wondered
that
such
a
stripling
could
commit
such
desperate
robberies
.
<EOS>
His
firmness
never
deserted
him
till
his
old
master
,
Mr.
Wood
,
was
examined
.
<EOS>
Then
he
_
did
_
give
way
a
bit
.
<EOS>
And
when
Mr.
Wood
's
daughter,--to
whom
,
I
've
heard
tell
,
he
was
attached
years
<EOS>
ago,--was
brought
up
,
his
courage
forsook
him
altogether
,
and
he
trembled
,
and
could
scarcely
stand
.
<EOS>
Poor
young
lady
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
She
_
trembled
too
,
and
was
unable
to
give
her
evidence
.
<EOS>
When
sentence
was
passed
there
was
n't
a
dry
eye
in
the
court
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
there
was
one
,
"
observed
Ireton
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
guess
who
you
mean
,
"
rejoined
Shotbolt
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Wild
's
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Right
,
"
answered
Ireton
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
strange
the
antipathy
he
bears
to
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
I
was
standing
near
Jack
at
that
awful
moment
,
and
beheld
the
look
Wild
fixed
on
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
like
the
grin
of
a
fiend
,
and
made
my
flesh
creep
on
my
bones
.
<EOS>
When
the
prisoner
was
removed
from
the
dock
,
we
met
Jonathan
as
we
passed
through
the
yard
.
<EOS>
He
stopped
us
,
and
,
addressing
Jack
in
a
taunting
tone
,
said
,
'
Well
,
I
've
been
as
good
as
my
word!'--'True
,
'
replied
Sheppard
;
'
and
I
'll
be
as
good
as
mine
!
'
<EOS>
And
so
they
parted
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
hope
he
will
,
if
it
's
anything
to
Jonathan
's
disadvantage
,
"
muttered
Mrs.
Spurling
,
half
aside
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
surprised
Mr.
Wild
has
n't
been
to
inquire
after
him
to
-
day
,
"
observed
Langley
;
"
it
's
the
first
time
he
's
missed
doing
so
since
the
trial
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
gone
to
Enfield
after
Blueskin
,
who
has
so
long
eluded
his
vigilance
,
"
rejoined
Austin
.
"
<EOS>
Quilt
Arnold
called
this
morning
to
say
so
.
<EOS>
Certain
information
,
it
seems
,
has
been
received
from
a
female
,
that
Blueskin
would
be
at
a
flash
-
ken
near
the
Chase
at
five
o'clock
to
-
day
,
and
they
're
all
set
out
in
the
expectation
of
nabbing
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Wild
had
a
narrow
escape
lately
,
in
that
affair
of
Captain
Darrell
,
"
observed
Shotbolt
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
exactly
know
the
rights
of
that
affair
,
"
rejoined
Griffin
,
with
some
curiosity
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nor
any
one
else
,
I
suspect
,
"
answered
Ireton
,
winking
significantly
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
mysterious
transaction
altogether
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
much
as
is
known
is
this
:
Captain
Darrell
,
who
resides
with
Mr.
Wood
at
Dollis
Hill
,
was
assaulted
and
half
-
killed
by
a
party
of
ruffians
,
headed
,
he
swore
,
by
Mr.
Wild
,
and
his
uncle
,
Sir
Rowland
Trenchard
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wild
,
however
,
proved
,
on
the
evidence
of
his
own
servants
,
that
he
was
at
the
Old
Bailey
at
the
time
;
and
Sir
Rowland
proved
that
_
he
_
was
in
Manchester
.
<EOS>
So
the
charge
was
dismissed
.
<EOS>
Another
charge
was
then
brought
against
them
by
the
Captain
,
who
accused
them
of
kidnapping
him
when
a
boy
,
and
placing
him
in
the
hands
of
a
Dutch
skipper
,
named
Van
Galgebrok
,
with
instructions
to
throw
him
overboard
,
which
was
done
,
though
he
afterwards
escaped
.
<EOS>
But
this
accusation
,
for
want
of
sufficient
evidence
,
met
with
the
same
fate
as
the
first
,
and
Jonathan
came
off
victorious
.
<EOS>
It
was
thought
,
however
,
if
the
skipper
_
could
_
have
been
found
,
that
the
result
of
the
case
would
have
been
materially
different
.
<EOS>
This
was
rather
too
much
to
expect
;
for
we
all
know
,
if
Mr.
Wild
wishes
to
keep
a
man
out
of
the
way
,
he
'll
speedily
find
the
means
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
"
cried
the
jailers
,
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
"
_
I
_
could
have
given
awkward
evidence
in
that
case
,
if
I
'd
been
so
inclined
,
"
said
Mrs.
Spurling
,
"
<EOS>
ay
and
found
Van
Galgebrok
too
.
<EOS>
But
I
never
betray
an
old
customer
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Wild
is
a
great
man
,
"
said
the
hangman
,
replenishing
his
pipe
,
"
and
we
owe
him
much
,
and
ought
to
support
him
.
<EOS>
Were
any
thing
to
happen
to
him
,
Newgate
would
n't
be
what
it
is
,
nor
Tyburn
either
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Wild
has
given
you
some
employment
,
Mr.
Marvel
,
"
remarked
Shotbolt
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
little
,
Sir
,
"
replied
the
executioner
,
with
a
grim
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
Out
of
the
twelve
hundred
subjects
I
've
tucked
up
,
I
may
safely
place
half
to
his
account
.
<EOS>
If
ever
he
requires
my
services
,
he
shall
find
I
'm
not
ungrateful
.
<EOS>
And
though
I
say
it
that
should
n't
say
it
,
no
man
can
tie
a
better
knot
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wild
,
gentlemen
,
and
the
nubbin
'
cheat
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Fill
your
glasses
,
gentlemen
,
"
observed
Ireton
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
a
droll
thing
Jack
said
this
morning
.
<EOS>
Amongst
others
who
came
to
see
him
,
was
a
Mr.
Kneebone
,
a
woollen
-
draper
in
Wych
Street
,
with
whose
pockets
,
it
appears
,
Jack
,
when
a
lad
,
made
a
little
too
free
.
<EOS>
As
this
gentleman
was
going
away
,
he
said
to
Jack
in
a
jesting
manner
,
'
that
he
should
be
glad
to
see
him
to
-
night
at
supper
.
'
<EOS>
Upon
which
the
other
answered
,
'
that
he
accepted
his
invitation
with
pleasure
,
and
would
make
a
point
of
waiting
upon
him
,
'
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
_
Did
_
<EOS>
he
say
so
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Shotbolt
.
<EOS>
"
Then
I
advise
you
to
look
sharply
after
him
,
Mr.
Ireton
;
for
may
I
be
hanged
myself
if
I
do
n't
believe
he
'll
be
as
good
as
his
word
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
two
women
,
very
smartly
attired
in
silk
hoods
and
cloaks
,
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
Lodge
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
who
have
we
here
?
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Griffin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Only
Jack
's
two
wives
--
Edgeworth
Bess
and
Poll
Maggot
,
"
replied
Austin
,
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
ca
n't
go
into
the
Condemned
Hold
,
"
said
Ireton
,
consequentially
;
<EOS>
"
it
's
against
Mr.
Wild
's
orders
.
<EOS>
They
must
see
the
prisoner
at
the
hatch
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Austin
,
rising
and
walking
towards
them
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
my
pretty
dears
,
"
he
added
,
"
--to
see
your
husband
,
eh
?
<EOS>
You
must
make
the
most
of
your
time
.
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
have
him
long
.
<EOS>
You
've
heard
the
news
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
 
"
That
the
death
warrant
's
arrived
,
"
returned
Edgeworth
Bess
,
bursting
into
a
flood
of
tears
;
"
<EOS>
oh
,
yes
!
<EOS>
we
've
heard
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
does
Jack
bear
it
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mrs.
Maggot
.
 
<EOS>
"
Like
a
hero
,
"
answered
Austin
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
knew
he
would
,
"
replied
the
Amazon
.
"
<EOS>
Come
Bess,--no
whimpering
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
unman
him
.
<EOS>
Are
we
to
see
him
here
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
love
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
lose
no
time
in
bringing
him
to
us
,
"
said
Mrs.
Maggot
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
guinea
to
drink
our
health
,
"
she
added
,
slipping
a
piece
of
money
into
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
,
Caliban
,
"
shouted
the
under
-
turnkey
,
"
<EOS>
unlock
Captain
Sheppard
's
padlock
,
and
tell
him
his
wives
are
in
the
Lodge
waiting
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Iss
,
Massa
Austin
,
"
replied
the
black
.
<EOS>
And
taking
the
keys
,
he
departed
on
the
errand
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
was
gone
,
the
two
women
divested
themselves
of
their
hoods
and
cloaks
,
and
threw
them
,
as
if
inadvertently
,
into
the
farthest
part
of
the
angle
in
the
wall
.
<EOS>
Their
beautifully
proportioned
figures
and
rather
over
-
displayed
shoulders
attracted
the
notice
of
Austin
,
who
inquired
of
the
chief
turnkey
"
whether
he
should
stand
by
them
during
the
interview
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
never
mind
them
,
"
said
Mrs.
Spurling
,
who
had
been
hastily
compounding
another
bowl
of
punch
.
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
,
and
enjoy
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
'll
keep
a
look
out
that
nothing
happens
.
"
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
Caliban
had
returned
,
and
Jack
appeared
at
the
hatch
.
<EOS>
He
was
wrapped
in
a
loose
dressing
-
gown
of
light
material
,
and
stood
near
the
corner
where
the
women
's
dresses
had
just
been
thrown
down
,
quite
out
of
sight
of
all
the
party
,
except
Mrs.
Spurling
,
who
sat
on
the
right
of
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
got
Jonathan
out
of
the
way
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
,
in
an
eager
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
"
replied
Edgeworth
Bess
.
<EOS>
"
Patience
Kite
has
lured
him
to
Enfield
on
a
false
scent
after
Blueskin
.
<EOS>
You
need
fear
no
interruption
from
him
,
or
any
of
his
myrmidons
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
well
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
Now
stand
before
me
,
Poll
.
<EOS>
I
've
got
the
watch
-
spring
saw
in
my
sleeve
.
<EOS>
Pretend
to
weep
both
of
you
as
loudly
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
This
spike
is
more
than
half
cut
through
.
<EOS>
I
was
at
work
at
it
yesterday
and
the
day
before
.
<EOS>
Keep
up
the
clamour
for
five
minutes
,
and
I
'll
finish
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
Thus
urged
,
the
damsels
began
to
raise
their
voices
in
loud
lamentation
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
the
devil
are
you
howling
about
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Langley
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
we
are
to
be
disturbed
in
this
way
?
<EOS>
Make
less
noise
,
hussies
,
or
<EOS>
I
'll
turn
you
out
of
the
Lodge
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
For
shame
,
Mr.
Langley
,
"
rejoined
Mrs.
Spurling
:
"
<EOS>
I
blush
for
you
,
Sir
!
<EOS>
To
call
yourself
a
man
,
and
interfere
with
the
natural
course
of
affection
!
<EOS>
Have
you
no
feeling
for
the
situation
of
those
poor
disconsolate
creatures
,
about
to
be
bereaved
of
all
they
hold
dear
?
<EOS>
Is
it
nothing
to
part
with
a
husband
to
the
gallows
?
<EOS>
I
've
lost
four
in
the
same
way
,
and
know
what
it
is
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
she
began
to
blubber
loudly
for
sympathy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Comfort
yourself
,
my
charmer
,
"
said
Mr.
Marvel
,
in
a
tone
intended
to
be
consolatory
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
be
their
substitute
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
_
You
!
<EOS>
_
"
cried
the
tapstress
,
with
a
look
of
horror
:
"
Never
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Confusion
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
Jack
,
suddenly
pausing
in
his
task
,
"
the
saw
has
broken
just
as
I
am
through
the
spike
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ca
n't
we
break
it
off
?
"
replied
Mrs.
Maggot
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
fear
not
,
"
replied
Jack
,
despondingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
's
try
,
at
all
events
,
"
returned
the
Amazon
.
 
<EOS>
And
grasping
the
thick
iron
rod
,
she
pushed
with
all
her
force
against
it
,
while
Jack
seconded
her
efforts
from
within
.
<EOS>
After
great
exertions
on
both
parts
,
the
spike
yielded
to
their
combined
strength
,
and
snapped
suddenly
off
.
 
<EOS>
"
Holloa
--
what
's
that
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Austin
,
starting
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
Only
my
darbies
,
"
returned
Jack
,
clinking
his
chains
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
that
was
all
,
was
it
?
"
said
the
turnkey
,
quietly
reseating
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
give
me
the
woollen
cloth
to
tie
round
my
fetters
,
"
whispered
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Quick
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Here
it
is
,
"
replied
Edgeworth
Bess
.
 
<EOS>
"
Give
me
your
hand
,
Poll
,
to
help
me
through
,
"
cried
Jack
,
as
he
accomplished
the
operation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Keep
a
sharp
look
out
,
Bess
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Stop
!
"
<EOS>
interposed
Edgeworth
Bess
;
"
Mr.
Langley
is
getting
up
,
and
coming
this
way
.
<EOS>
We
're
lost
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Help
me
through
at
all
hazards
,
Poll
,
"
cried
Jack
,
straining
towards
the
opening
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
danger
's
past
,
"
whispered
Bess
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Spurling
has
induced
him
to
sit
down
again
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
she
looks
this
way
,
and
puts
her
finger
to
her
lips
.
<EOS>
She
comprehends
what
we
're
about
.
<EOS>
We
're
all
safe
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
lose
a
moment
then
,
"
cried
Jack
,
forcing
himself
into
the
aperture
,
while
the
Amazon
,
assisted
by
Bess
,
pulled
him
through
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
cried
Mrs.
Maggot
,
as
she
placed
him
without
noise
upon
the
ground
;
"
you
're
safe
so
far
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Come
,
my
disconsolate
darlings
,
"
cried
Austin
,
"
it
only
wants
five
minutes
to
six
.
<EOS>
I
expect
Mr.
Wild
here
presently
.
<EOS>
Cut
it
as
short
as
you
can
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Only
two
minutes
more
,
Sir
,
"
intreated
Edgeworth
Bess
,
advancing
towards
him
in
such
a
manner
as
to
screen
Jack
,
who
crept
into
the
farthest
part
of
the
angle,--"only
two
minutes
,
and
we
've
done
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
I
'm
not
within
a
minute
,
"
rejoined
the
turnkey
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
never
be
able
to
get
you
out
unseen
,
Jack
,
"
whispered
Poll
Maggot
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
make
a
bold
push
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Impossible
,
"
replied
Sheppard
,
in
the
same
tone
.
<EOS>
"
That
would
be
certain
destruction
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
run
in
these
heavy
fetters
.
<EOS>
No
:
I
must
face
it
out
.
<EOS>
Tell
Bess
to
slip
out
,
and
I
'll
put
on
her
cloak
and
hood
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
party
at
the
table
continued
drinking
and
chatting
as
merrily
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
help
thinking
of
Jack
Sheppard
's
speech
to
Mr.
Kneebone
,
"
observed
Shotbolt
,
as
he
emptied
his
tenth
tumbler
;
"
I
'm
sure
he
's
meditating
an
escape
,
and
hopes
to
accomplish
it
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Poh
!
<EOS>
poh
!
"
rejoined
Ireton
;
"
it
was
mere
idle
boasting
.
<EOS>
I
examined
the
Condemned
Hold
myself
carefully
this
morning
,
and
did
n't
find
a
nail
out
of
its
place
.
<EOS>
Recollect
,
he
's
chained
to
the
ground
by
a
great
horse
-
padlock
,
and
is
never
unloosed
except
when
he
comes
to
that
hatch
.
<EOS>
If
he
escapes
at
all
,
it
must
be
before
our
faces
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
n't
surprise
me
if
he
did
,
"
remarked
Griffin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
audacity
enough
for
anything
.
<EOS>
He
got
out
in
much
the
same
way
from
the
Gatehouse,--stole
the
keys
,
and
passed
through
a
room
where
I
was
sitting
half
-
asleep
in
a
chair
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Caught
you
napping
,
eh
?
"
rejoined
Ireton
,
with
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
he
wo
n't
do
that
here
.
<EOS>
I
'll
forgive
him
if
he
does
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
will
I
,
"
said
Austin
.
<EOS>
"
We
're
too
wide
awake
for
that
.
<EOS>
Ai
n't
we
,
partner
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
appealing
to
Langley
,
whom
punch
had
made
rather
dozy
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
so
,
"
responded
the
lethargic
turnkey
,
with
a
yawn
.
 
<EOS>
During
this
colloquy
,
Jack
had
contrived
unobserved
to
put
on
the
hood
and
cloak
,
and
being
about
the
size
of
the
rightful
owner
,
presented
a
very
tolerable
resemblance
to
her
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
Edgeworth
Bess
,
who
watched
her
opportunity
,
slipped
out
of
the
Lodge
.
 
<EOS>
"
Halloa
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Austin
,
who
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
departing
figure
,
"
one
of
the
women
is
gone
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
--
no
,
"
hastily
interposed
Mrs.
Spurling
;
"
they
're
both
here
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
see
they
're
putting
on
their
cloaks
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
false
!
"
<EOS>
rejoined
Marvel
,
in
a
low
tone
<EOS>
;
"
I
perceive
what
has
taken
place
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
goodness
!
<EOS>
"
ejaculated
the
tapstress
,
in
alarm
.
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
betray
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Say
the
word
,
and
I
'm
mum
,
"
returned
the
executioner
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
be
mine
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
very
unfair
advantage
to
take
--
<EOS>
very
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Spurling
;
"
however
I
consent
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
I
'll
lend
a
helping
hand
.
<EOS>
I
shall
lose
my
fees
and
the
laced
coat
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
better
to
have
the
bride
without
the
weddin
'
dress
,
than
the
weddin
'
dress
without
the
bride
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
Saint
Sepulchre
's
clock
struck
six
.
 
<EOS>
"
Close
the
wicket
,
Austin
,
"
vociferated
Ireton
,
in
an
authoritative
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
bye
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jack
,
as
if
taking
leave
of
his
mistresses
,
"
to
-
morrow
,
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
We
'll
be
punctual
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Maggot
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
bye
,
Jack
!
<EOS>
Keep
up
your
spirits
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Now
for
it!--life
or
death
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Jack
,
assuming
the
gait
of
a
female
,
and
stepping
towards
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
As
Austin
rose
to
execute
his
principal
's
commands
,
and
usher
the
women
to
the
gate
,
Mrs.
Spurling
and
Marvel
rose
too
.
<EOS>
The
latter
walked
carelessly
towards
the
hatch
,
and
leaning
his
back
against
the
place
<EOS>
whence
the
spike
had
been
removed
,
so
as
completely
to
hide
it
,
continued
smoking
his
pipe
as
coolly
as
if
nothing
had
happened
.
 
<EOS>
Just
as
Jack
gained
the
entrance
,
he
heard
a
man
's
footstep
behind
him
,
and
aware
that
the
slightest
indiscretion
would
betray
him
,
he
halted
,
uncertain
what
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stop
a
minute
,
my
dear
,
"
cried
Austin
.
<EOS>
"
You
forget
that
you
promised
me
a
kiss
the
last
time
you
were
here
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
one
from
me
do
as
well
?
<EOS>
"
interposed
Mrs.
Maggot
.
 
<EOS>
"
Much
better
,
"
said
Mrs.
Spurling
,
hastening
to
the
rescue
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
speak
to
Edgeworth
Bess
myself
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
she
planted
herself
between
Jack
and
the
turnkey
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
moment
of
breathless
interest
to
all
engaged
in
the
attempt
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
--
the
kiss
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Austin
,
endeavouring
to
pass
his
arm
familiarly
round
the
Amazon
's
waist
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hands
off
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
"
or
you
'll
repent
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
'll
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
turnkey
.
 
<EOS>
"
Teach
you
to
keep
your
distance
!
"
<EOS>
retorted
Mrs.
Maggot
,
dealing
him
a
buffet
that
sent
him
reeling
several
yards
backwards
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
!
<EOS>
off
with
you
!
"
<EOS>
whispered
Mrs.
Spurling
,
squeezing
Jack
's
arm
,
and
pushing
him
towards
the
door
,
"
and
,
do
n't
come
here
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Before
Austin
could
recover
himself
,
Jack
and
Mrs.
Maggot
had
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bolt
the
wicket
!
"
<EOS>
shouted
Ireton
,
who
,
with
the
others
,
had
been
not
a
little
entertained
by
the
gallant
turnkey
's
discomfiture
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
done
,
and
Austin
returned
with
a
crest
-
fallen
look
to
the
table
.
<EOS>
Upon
which
Mrs.
Spurling
,
and
her
now
accepted
suitor
,
resumed
their
seats
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
'll
be
as
good
as
your
word
,
my
charmer
,
"
whispered
the
executioner
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
responded
the
widow
,
heaving
a
deep
sigh
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Jack
!
<EOS>
Jack!--you
<EOS>
little
know
what
a
price
I
've
paid
for
you
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
'm
glad
those
women
are
gone
,
"
remarked
Shotbolt
.
<EOS>
"
Coupling
their
presence
with
Jack
's
speech
,
I
could
n't
help
fearing
some
mischief
might
ensue
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
reminds
me
<EOS>
he
's
still
at
large
,
"
returned
Ireton
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
,
Caliban
,
go
and
fasten
his
padlock
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Iss
,
Massa
Ireton
,
"
replied
the
black
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stop
,
Caliban
,
"
interposed
Mrs.
Spurling
,
who
wished
to
protract
the
discovery
of
the
escape
as
long
as
possible
.
<EOS>
"
Before
you
go
,
bring
me
the
bottle
of
pine
-
apple
rum
I
opened
yesterday
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
Mr.
Ireton
and
his
friends
to
taste
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
in
the
lower
cupboard
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
you
have
n't
got
the
key
<EOS>
--
then
_
I
_
must
have
it
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
How
provoking
!
"
<EOS>
she
added
,
pretending
to
rummage
her
pockets
;
"
<EOS>
one
never
_
can
_
find
a
thing
when
one
wants
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
it
,
my
dear
Mrs.
Spurling
,
"
rejoined
Ireton
;
"
we
can
taste
the
rum
when
he
returns
.
<EOS>
We
shall
have
Mr.
Wild
here
presently
,
and
I
would
n't
for
the
world
--
Zounds
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
as
the
figure
of
the
thief
-
taker
appeared
at
the
wicket
,
"
here
he
is
.
<EOS>
Off
with
you
,
Caliban
!
<EOS>
Fly
,
you
rascal
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Wild
here
!
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Spurling
in
alarm
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
gracious
!
<EOS>
he
's
lost
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Who
's
lost
?
"
demanded
Ireton
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
key
,
"
replied
the
widow
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
turnkeys
rose
to
salute
the
thief
-
taker
,
whose
habitually
-
sullen
countenance
looked
gloomier
than
usual
.
<EOS>
Ireton
rushed
forward
to
open
the
wicket
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
Blueskin
,
I
perceive
,
Sir
,
"
he
observed
,
in
a
deferential
tone
,
as
Wild
entered
the
Lodge
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Jonathan
,
moodily
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
been
deceived
by
false
information
.
<EOS>
But
the
wench
who
tricked
me
shall
bitterly
repent
it
.
<EOS>
I
hope
this
is
all
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
fear
I
might
be
purposely
go
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
Nothing
has
gone
wrong
here
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
whatever
,
"
replied
Ireton
.
<EOS>
"
Jack
is
just
gone
back
to
the
Condemned
Hold
.
<EOS>
His
two
wives
have
been
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
"
exclaimed
Jonathan
,
with
a
sudden
vehemence
that
electrified
the
chief
turnkey
;
"
what
's
this
!
<EOS>
a
spike
gone
!
'
<EOS>
Sdeath
!
<EOS>
the
women
,
you
say
,
have
been
here
.
<EOS>
He
has
escaped
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Impossible
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Ireton
,
greatly
alarmed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Impossible
!
"
echoed

<EOS>
No

Sir
,
it
's
quite
possible

more
than
possible

<EOS>
It
's
certain

<EOS>
I
'll
lay
my

gone

Come
with
me
to

confirmed

I'll--
"
 
He
was
here
interrupted
by
the
sudden
entrance
of
the
black
,
who
rushed
precipitately
into
the
room
,
letting
fall
the
heavy
bunch
of
keys
in
his
fright
.
 
<EOS>
"
O

ejaculated
Caliban

<EOS>
"
I
knew

rejoined
Wild
,
with
concentrated
rage
;
"
and
he
escaped
you
all
,
in
broad
day
,
before
your
faces

<EOS>
You
may
well
say
it
's
impossible

<EOS>
His
Majesty

admirably
guarded

I
must
say
.
<EOS>
Ireton
,
you
are
in

<EOS>
"
Sir

said
the
chief
turnkey

indignantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You

Sir

thundered
Jonathan
;
"
and
,
unless
you
find
him
,
you
sha
n't
hold
your
place
a
week
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
threaten
idly
,
as
you
know

<EOS>
And
you

Austin

and
you
Langley

I
say
the
same
thing
to
you

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
But
,
Mr.
Wild
,
"
implored
the
turnkeys
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
said
it
,
"
rejoined
Jonathan
,
peremptorily
.
"
<EOS>
And
you
,
Marvel
,
you
must
have
been
a
party--
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
,
Sir
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
he
's
not

I
'll
get
a

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Zounds
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Marvel
,
"
I--
"
 
"
Hush
!
"
whispered
the
tapstress
,
"
or
I
retract
my
promise
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Spurling
,
"
said
Jonathan
,
who
overheard
the
whisper
,
"
you
owe
your
situation
to
me
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
aided
Jack
Sheppard
's
escape

you
shall
owe
your
discharge

also

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
As
you
please
,
Sir

"
replied
the
tapstress
,
coolly
.
"
<EOS>
And
the
next
time
Captain
Darrell
wants
a
witness

I
promise
you
he
sha
n't
look
for
one
in
vain

"
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
hussy
,
dare
you
threaten
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Wild
;
but
,
checking
himself
,
he
turned
to
Ireton
and
asked
,
"
How
long
have
the
women
been
gone
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Scarcely
five
minutes
,
"
replied
the
latter
.
 
<EOS>
"
One
of
you
fly
to
the
market
,
"
returned
Jonathan
;
"
another
to
the
river
;
a
third
to
the
New
Mint
.
<EOS>
Disperse
in
every
direction
.
<EOS>
We
'll
have
him
yet
.
<EOS>
A
hundred
pounds
to
the
man
who
takes
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
rushed
out
,
followed
by
Ireton
and
Langley
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
hundred
pounds
!
"
exclaimed
Shotbolt
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
glorious
reward
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
he
'll
pay
it
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
of
it
,
"
replied
Austin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
I
'll
have
it
before
to
-
morrow
morning
,
"
said
the
keeper
of
the
New
Prison
,
to
himself
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
Jack
Sheppard
sups
with
Mr.
Kneebone
,
I
'll
make
one

CHAPTER
XI
.
 
<EOS>
Dollis
Hill
revisited
.
  
<EOS>
About
an
hour
after
the
occurrences
at
Newgate
,
the
door
of
the
small
back
-
parlour
already
described
at
Dollis
Hill
was
opened
by
Winifred
,
who
,
gliding
noiselessly
across
the
room
,
approached
a
couch
,
on
which
was
extended
a
sleeping
female
,
and
,
gazing
anxiously
at
her
pale
careworn
countenance
,
murmured,--"Heaven
be
praised
!
<EOS>
she
still
slumbers
--
slumbers
peacefully
.
<EOS>
The
opiate
has
done
its
duty
.
<EOS>
Poor
thing
!
<EOS>
how
beautiful
she
looks
!
<EOS>
but
how
like
death
!
"
 
<EOS>
Deathlike
,
indeed
,
was
the
repose
of
the
sleeper,--deathlike
and
deep
.
<EOS>
Its
very
calmness
was
frightful
.
<EOS>
Her
lips
were
apart
,
but
no
breath
seemed
to
issue
from
them
;
and
,
but
for
a
slight
--
very
slight
palpitation
of
the
bosom
,
the
vital
principle
might
be
supposed
to
be
extinct
.
<EOS>
This
lifeless
appearance
was
heightened
by
the
extreme
sharpness
of
her
features
--
especially
the
nose
and
chin,--and
by
the
emaciation
of
her
limbs
,
which
was
painfully
distinct
through
her
drapery
.
<EOS>
Her
attenuated
arms
were
crossed
upon
her
breast
;
and
her
black
brows
and
eyelashes
contrasted
fearfully
with
the
livid
whiteness
of
her
skin
.
<EOS>
A
few
short
,
dark
locks
,
escaping
from
beneath
her
head
-
dress
,
showed
that
her
hair
had
been
removed
,
and
had
only
been
recently
allowed
to
grow
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
Mrs.
Sheppard
!
<EOS>
"
sighed
Winifred
,
as
she
contemplated
the
beautiful
wreck
before
her,--"Poor
Mrs.
Sheppard
!
<EOS>
when
I
see
her
thus
,
and
think
of
all
she
has
endured
,
of
all
she
may
yet
have
to
endure
,
I
could
almost
pray
for
her
release
from
trouble
.
<EOS>
I
dare
not
reflect
upon
the
effect
that
her
son
's
fate,--if
the
efforts
to
save
him
are
<EOS>
ineffectual,--may
have
upon
her
enfeebled
frame
,
and
still
worse
upon
her
mind
.
<EOS>
What
a
mercy
that
the
blow
aimed
at
her
by
the
ruffian
,
Wild
,
though
it
brought
her
to
the
brink
of
the
grave
,
should
have
restored
her
to
reason
!
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
she
stirs
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
she
said
this
,
she
drew
a
little
aside
,
while
Mrs.
Sheppard
heaved
a
deep
sigh
,
and
opened
her
eyes
,
which
now
looked
larger
,
blacker
,
and
more
melancholy
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
am
I
?
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
passing
her
hand
across
her
brow
.
 
<EOS>
"
With
your
friends
,
dear
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
"
replied
Winifred
,
advancing
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
are
there
,
my
dear
young
lady
,
"
said
the
widow
,
smiling
faintly
;
"
when
I
first
waken
,
I
'm
always
in
dread
of
finding
myself
again
in
that
horrible
asylum
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
need
never
be
afraid
of
that
,
"
returned
Winifred
,
affectionately
;
"
my
father
will
take
care
<EOS>
you
never
leave
him
more
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
how
much
I
owe
him
!
"
said
the
widow
,
with
fervour
,
"
for
bringing
me
here
,
and
removing
me
from
those
dreadful
sights
and
sounds
,
that
would
have
driven
me
distracted
,
even
if
I
had
been
in
my
right
mind
.
<EOS>
And
how
much
I
owe
_
<EOS>
you
_
<EOS>
,
too
,
dearest
Winifred
,
for
your
kindness
and
attention
.
<EOS>
Without
you
I
should
never
have
recovered
either
health
or
reason
.
<EOS>
I
can
never
be
grateful
enough
.
<EOS>
But
,
though
_
I
_
can
not
reward
you
,
Heaven
will
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Do
n't
say
anything
about
it
,
dear
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
"
rejoined
Winifred
,
controlling
her
emotion
,
and
speaking
as
cheerfully
as
she
could
;
"
I
would
do
anything
in
the
world
for
you
,
and
so
would
my
father
,
and
so
would
Thames
;
but
he
_
ought
_
,
for
he
's
your
nephew
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
We
all
love
you
dearly
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Bless
you
!
<EOS>
bless
you
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
averting
her
face
to
hide
her
tears
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
n't
tell
you
what
Thames
means
to
do
for
you
if
ever
he
gains
his
rights
,
"
continued
Winifred
;
"
but
I
_
may
_
tell
you
what
my
father
means
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
done
too
much
already
,
"
answered
the
widow
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
need
little
more
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
,
_
do
_
hear
what
it
is
,
"
rejoined
Winifred
;
"
you
know
I
'm
shortly
to
be
united
to
your
nephew,--that
is
,
"
she
added
,
blushing
,
"
when
he
can
be
married
by
his
right
name
,
for
my
father
wo
n't
consent
to
it
before
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
father
will
never
oppose
your
happiness
,
my
dear
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sure
,
"
said
Mrs.
Sheppard
;
"
but
,
what
has
this
to
do
with
me
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
hear
,
"
replied
Winifred
;
"
when
this
marriage
takes
place
,
you
and
I
shall
be
closely
allied
,
but
my
father
wishes
for
a
still
closer
alliance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
unterstand
you
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
be
plain
,
then
,
"
said
Winifred
,
"
he
has
asked
me
whether
I
have
any
objection
to
you
as
a
mother
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
what
--
what
was
your
answer
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
widow
,
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ca
n't
you
guess
?
"
returned
Winifred
,
throwing
her
arms
about
her
neck
.
<EOS>
"
That
he
could
n't
choose
any
one
so
agreeable
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Winifred
,
"
said
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
after
a
brief
pause
,
during
which
she
appeared
overcome
by
her
feelings,--she
said
,
gently
disengaging
herself
from
the
young
girl
's
embrace
,
and
speaking
in
a
firm
voice
,
"
you
must
dissuade
your
father
from
this
step
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
?
"
exclaimed
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
Can
you
not
love
him
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Love
him
!
"
echoed
the
widow
.
<EOS>
"
The
feeling
is
dead
within
my
breast
.
<EOS>
My
only
love
is
for
my
poor
lost
son
.
<EOS>
I
can
esteem
him
,
regard
him
;
but
,
love
him
as
he
_
ought
_
to
be
loved
--
that
I
can
not
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
esteem
is
all
he
will
require
,
"
urged
Winifred
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
it
,
and
will
ever
have
it
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
passionately,--"he
has
my
boundless
gratitude
,
and
devotion
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
not
worthy
to
be
any
man
's
wife
--
far
less
<EOS>
_
his
_
wife
.
<EOS>
Winifred
,
you
are
deceived
in
me
.
<EOS>
You
know
not
what
a
wretched
guilty
thing
I
am
.
<EOS>
You
know
not
in
what
dark
places
my
life
has
been
cast
;
with
what
crimes
it
has
been
stained
.
<EOS>
But
the
offences
I
_
have
_
committed
are
venial
in
comparison
with
what
I
should
commit
were
I
to
we
d
your
father
.
<EOS>
No
--
<EOS>
no
,
it
must
never
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
paint
yourself
worse
than
you
are
,
dear
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
"
rejoined
Winifred
kindly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
faults
were
the
faults
of
circumstances
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Palliate
them
as
you
may
,
"
replied
the
widow
,
gravely
,
"
they
_
were
_
faults
;
and
as
such
,
can
not
be
repaired
by
a
greater
wrong
.
<EOS>
If
you
love
me
,
do
not
allude
to
this
subject
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sorry
I
mentioned
it
at
all
,
since
it
distresses
you
,
"
returned
Winifred
;
"
but
,
as
I
knew
my
father
intended
to
propose
to
you
,
if
poor
Jack
should
be
respited--
"
 
<EOS>
"
_
<EOS>
If
_
he
should
be
respited
?
"
repeated
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
with
startling
eagerness
.
"
<EOS>
Does
your
father
doubt
it
?
<EOS>
Speak
!
<EOS>
tell
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
Winifred
made
no
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
hesitation
convinces
me
he
does
,
"
replied
the
widow
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Is
Thames
returned
from
London
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
yet
,
"
replied
the
other
;
"
but
I
expect
him
every
minute
.
<EOS>
My
father
's
chief
fear
,
I
must
tell
you
,
is
from
the
baneful
influence
of
Jonathan
Wild
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
fiend
is
ever
in
my
path
,
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
with
a
look
,
the
wildness
of
which
greatly
alarmed
her
companion
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
scare
him
thence
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hark
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Winifred
,
"
<EOS>
Thames
is
arrived
.
<EOS>
I
hear
the
sound
of
his
horse
's
feet
in
the
yard
.
<EOS>
Now
you
will
learn
the
result
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Heaven
support
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
faintly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Breathe
at
this
phial
,
"
said
Winifred
.
 
<EOS>
Shortly
afterwards,--it
seemed
an
age
to
the
anxious
mother,--Mr
.
<EOS>
Wood
entered
the
room
,
followed
by
Thames
.
<EOS>
The
latter
looked
very
pale
,
either
from
the
effect
of
his
wound
,
which
was
not
yet
entirely
healed
,
or
from
suppressed
emotion,--partly
,
perhaps
,
from
both
causes,--and
wore
his
left
arm
in
a
sling
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
cried
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
raising
herself
,
and
looking
at
him
as
if
her
life
depended
upon
the
answer
.
<EOS>
"
He
is
respited
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
<EOS>
no
,
"
replied
Thames
,
sadly
.
<EOS>
"
The
warrant
for
his
execution
is
arrived
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
further
hope
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
poor
son
!
"
groaned
the
widow
,
sinking
backwards
.
 
<EOS>
"
Heaven
have
mercy
on
his
soul
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
Jack
!
"
cried
Winifred
,
burying
her
face
in
her
lover
's
bosom
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
word
was
uttered
for
some
time
,
nor
any
sound
heard
except
the
stilled
sobs
of
the
unfortunate
mother
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
she
suddenly
started
to
her
feet
;
and
before
Winifred
could
prevent
her
,
staggered
up
to
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
is
he
to
suffer
?
<EOS>
"
she
demanded
,
fixing
her
large
black
eyes
,
which
burnt
with
an
insane
gleam
,
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
On
Friday
,
"
he
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
Friday
!
"
echoed
Mrs.
Sheppard
;
"
and
to
-
day
is
Monday
.
<EOS>
He
has
three
days
to
live
.
<EOS>
Only
three
days
.
<EOS>
Three
short
days
.
<EOS>
Horrible
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
soul
!
<EOS>
her
senses
are
going
again
,
"
said
Mr.
Wood
,
terrified
by
the
wildness
of
her
looks
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
afraid
it
would
be
so
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Only
three
days
,
"
reiterated
the
widow
,
"
three
short
short
<EOS>
days,--and
then
all
is
over
.
<EOS>
Jonathan
's
wicked
threat
is
fulfilled
at
last
.
<EOS>
The
gallows
is
in
view
--
I
see
it
with
all
its
hideous
apparatus!--ough
!
"
and
shuddering
violently
,
she
placed
her
hands
before
her
,
as
if
to
exclude
some
frightful
vision
from
her
sight
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
despair
,
my
sweet
soul
,
"
said
Wood
,
in
a
soothing
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
despair
!
"
echoed
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
with
a
laugh
that
cut
the
ears
of
those
who
listened
to
it
like
a
razor,--"Do
not
despair
!
<EOS>
And
who
or
what
shall
give
me
comfort
when
my
son
is
gone
?
<EOS>
I
have
wept
till
my
eyes
are
dry,--suffered
<EOS>
till
my
heart
is
broken,--prayed
till
the
voice
of
prayer
is
dumb,--and
all
of
no
avail
.
<EOS>
He
will
be
hanged
--
hanged
--
hanged
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
What
have
I
left
but
despair
and
madness
?
<EOS>
Promise
me
one
thing
,
Mr.
Wood
,
"
she
continued
,
with
a
sudden
change
of
tone
,
and
convulsively
clutching
the
carpenter
's
arm
,
"
promise
it
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Anything
,
my
dear
,
"
replied
Wood
,
"
What
is
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Bury
us
together
in
one
grave
in
Willesden
churchyard
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
small
yew
-
tree
west
of
the
church
.
<EOS>
Beneath
that
tree
let
us
lie
.
<EOS>
In
one
grave
,
mind
.
<EOS>
Do
you
promise
to
do
this
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Solemnly
,
"
rejoined
the
carpenter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Enough
,
"
said
the
widow
,
gratefully
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
see
him
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Impossible
,
dear
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
"
said
Thames
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
I
will
take
you
to
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
To
-
morrow
will
be
too
late
,
"
replied
the
widow
,
in
a
hollow
voice
,
"
I
feel
it
will
.
<EOS>
I
must
go
to
-
night
,
or
I
shall
never
behold
him
again
.
<EOS>
I
must
bless
him
before
I
die
.
<EOS>
I
have
strength
enough
to
drag
myself
there
,
and
I
do
not
want
to
return
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Be
pacified
,
sweet
soul
,
"
said
Wood
,
looking
meaningly
at
Thames
;
"
you
_
shall
_
go
,
and
I
will
accompany
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
mother
's
blessing
on
you
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
fervently
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
"
she
added
,
with
somewhat
more
composure
,
"
leave
me
,
dear
friends
,
I
entreat
,
for
a
few
minutes
to
collect
my
scattered
thoughts
--
to
prepare
myself
for
what
I
have
to
go
through
--
to
pray
for
my
son
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
we
do
so
?
"
<EOS>
whispered
Winifred
to
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
all
means
,
"
returned
Wood
;
"
do
n't
delay
an
instant
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
followed
by
the
young
couple
,
who
gazed
wistfully
at
the
poor
sufferer
,
he
hastily
quitted
the
room
,
and
locked
the
door
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Sheppard
was
no
sooner
alone
than
she
fell
upon
her
knees
by
the
side
of
the
couch
,
and
poured
forth
her
heart
in
prayer
.
<EOS>
So
absorbed
was
she
by
her
passionate
supplications
that
she
was
insensible
to
anything
passing
around
her
,
until
she
felt
a
touch
upon
her
shoulder
,
and
heard
a
well
-
known
voice
breathe
in
her
ear--"Mother
!
"
 
<EOS>
She
started
at
the
sound
as
if
an
apparition
had
called
her
,
screamed
,
and
fell
into
her
son
's
outstretched
arms
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mother
!
<EOS>
dear
mother
!
"
cried
Jack
,
folding
her
to
his
breast
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
son
!
<EOS>
my
dear
,
dear
son
!
"
returned
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
returning
his
embrace
with
all
a
parent
's
tenderness
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
was
completely
overcome
.
<EOS>
His
chest
heaved
violently
,
and
big
tears
coursed
rapidly
down
his
cheeks
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
deserve
it
,
"
he
said
,
at
length
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
would
have
risked
a
thousand
deaths
to
enjoy
this
moment
's
happiness
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
must
have
risked
much
to
obtain
it
,
my
love
.
<EOS>
I
have
scarcely
recovered
from
the
shock
of
hearing
of
your
condemnation
,
when
I
behold
you
free
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
two
hours
since
,
"
rejoined
Jack
,
"
I
was
chained
down
in
the
Condemned
Hold
in
Newgate
.
<EOS>
With
a
small
saw
,
conveyed
to
me
a
few
days
since
by
Thames
Darrell
,
which
I
contrived
to
conceal
upon
my
person
,
I
removed
a
spike
in
the
hatch
,
and
,
with
the
aid
of
some
other
friends
,
worked
my
way
out
.
<EOS>
Having
heard
from
Thames
that
you
were
better
,
and
that
your
sole
anxiety
was
about
me
,
I
came
to
give
you
the
_
first
_
intelligence
of
my
escape
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Bless
you
for
it
.
<EOS>
But
you
will
stay
here
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
dare
not
.
<EOS>
I
must
provide
for
my
safety
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Wood
will
protect
you
,
"
urged
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
not
the
power
--
perhaps
not
the
will
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
And
if
he
would
,
_
<EOS>
I
_
would
not
subject
him
to
the
annoyance
.
<EOS>
The
moment
my
escape
is
known
,
a
large
reward
will
be
placed
on
my
head
.
<EOS>
My
dress
,
my
person
will
be
minutely
described
.
<EOS>
Jonathan
Wild
and
his
bloodhounds
,
with
a
hundred
others
,
incited
by
the
reward
,
will
be
upon
my
track
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
for
aught
I
know
,
some
of
them
may
even
now
have
got
scent
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
terrify
me
,
"
cried
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
if
this
is
the
case
,
do
not
stay
an
instant
.
<EOS>
Fly
!
fly
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
As
soon
as
I
can
do
so
with
safety
,
I
will
return
,
or
send
to
you
,
"
said
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
endanger
yourself
on
my
account
,
"
rejoined
his
mother
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
easy
now
;
receive
my
blessing
,
my
dear
son
;
and
if
we
never
meet
again
,
rest
assured
my
last
prayer
shall
be
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
talk
thus
,
dear
mother
,
"
returned
Jack
,
gazing
anxiously
at
her
pale
countenance
,
"
or
I
shall
not
be
able
to
quit
you
.
<EOS>
You
must
live
for
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
try
to
do
so
,
"
replied
the
widow
,
forcing
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
One
last
embrace
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
counsel
you
to
avoid
those
fatal
courses
which
have
placed
you
in
such
fearful
jeopardy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
,
"
replied
Jack
,
in
a
tone
of
the
deepest
compunction
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
oh
!
forgive
me
,
though
I
can
never
forgive
myself
,
for
the
misery
I
have
caused
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Forgive
you
!
"
echoed
his
mother
,
with
a
look
radiant
with
delight
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
to
forgive
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
she
screamed
,
with
a
sudden
change
of
manner
;
and
pointing
to
the
window
,
which
Jack
had
left
open
,
and
at
which
a
dark
figure
was
standing
,
"
there
is
Jonathan
Wild
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Betrayed
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Jack
,
glancing
in
the
same
direction
.
<EOS>
"
The
door!--the
door!--death
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
as
he
tried
the
handle
,
"
it
is
locked
--
and
I
am
unarmed
.
<EOS>
Madman
that
I
am
to
be
so
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Help
!
"
shrieked
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
silent
,
"
said
Jonathan
,
striding
deliberately
into
the
room
;
"
these
cries
will
avail
you
nothing
.
<EOS>
Whoever
answers
them
must
assist
me
to
capture
your
son
.
<EOS>
Be
silent
,
I
say
,
if
you
value
his
safety
.
"
 
<EOS>
Awed
by
Jonathan
's
manner
,
Mrs.
Sheppard
repressed
the
scream
that
rose
to
her
lips
,
and
both
mother
and
son
gazed
with
apprehension
at
the
heavy
figure
of
the
thief
-
taker
,
which
,
viewed
in
the
twilight
,
seemed
dilated
to
twice
its
natural
size
,
and
appeared
almost
to
block
up
the
window
.
<EOS>
In
addition
to
his
customary
arms
,
Jonathan
carried
a
bludgeon
with
a
large
heavy
knob
,
suspended
from
his
wrist
by
a
loop
;
a
favourite
weapon
,
which
he
always
took
with
him
on
dangerous
expeditions
,
and
which
,
if
any
information
had
been
requisite
,
would
have
told
Sheppard
that
the
present
was
one
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Jack
,
"
he
said
,
after
a
pause
,
"
are
you
disposed
to
go
back
quietly
with
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
'll
ascertain
that
when
you
attempt
to
touch
me
,
"
rejoined
Sheppard
,
resolutely
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
janizaries
are
within
call
,
"
returned
Wild
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
armed
;
you
are
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
matters
not
.
<EOS>
You
shall
not
take
me
alive
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Spare
him
!
<EOS>
spare
him
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
falling
on
her
knees
.
 
<EOS>
"
Get
up
,
mother
,
"
cried
Jack
;
"
do
not
kneel
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
would
n't
accept
my
life
from
him
.
<EOS>
I
've
foiled
him
hitherto
,
and
will
foil
him
yet
.
<EOS>
And
,
come
what
will
,
I
'll
balk
him
of
the
satisfaction
of
hanging
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
Jonathan
raised
his
bludgeon
,
but
controlled
himself
by
a
powerful
effort
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fool
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
"
do
you
think
I
would
n't
have
secured
you
before
this
if
I
had
n't
some
motive
for
my
forbearance
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
that
motive
is
fear
,
"
replied
Jack
contemptuously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fear
!
"
echoed
Wild
,
in
a
terrible
tone,--"fear
!
<EOS>
Repeat
that
word
again
,
and
nothing
shall
save
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
anger
him
,
my
dear
son
,
"
implored
the
poor
widow
,
with
a
look
of
anguish
at
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
he
means
well
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mad
as
you
are
<EOS>
,
you
're
the
more
sensible
of
the
two
,
I
must
say
,
"
rejoined
Jonathan
.
 
<EOS>
"
Spare
him
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs
,
Sheppard
,
who
fancied
she
had
made
some
impression
on
the
obdurate
breast
of
the
thief
-
taker,--"spare
him
!
<EOS>
and
I
will
forgive
you
,
will
thank
you
,
bless
you
.
<EOS>
Spare
him
!
<EOS>
spare
him
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
On
one
condition
I
_
will
_
spare
him
,
"
returned
Wild
;
"
on
one
condition
only
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
"
asked
the
poor
woman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Either
he
or
you
must
return
with
me
,
"
answered
Jonathan
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
_
me
_
,
then
,
"
replied
the
widow
.
<EOS>
And
she
would
have
rushed
to
him
,
if
she
had
not
been
forcibly
withheld
by
her
son
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
go
near
him
,
mother
,
"
cried
Jack
;
"
do
not
believe
him
.
<EOS>
There
is
some
deep
treachery
hidden
beneath
his
words
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
_
will
_
go
,
"
said
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
struggling
to
get
free
.
 
<EOS>
"
Attend
to
me
,
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
"
said
Jonathan
,
looking
calmly
on
at
this
distressing
scene
,
"
Attend
to
me
,
and
do
not
heed
him
.
<EOS>
I
swear
to
you
,
solemnly
swear
to
you
,
I
will
save
your
son
's
life
,
nay
more
,
will
befriend
him
,
will
place
him
out
of
the
reach
of
his
enemies
,
if
you
consent
to
become
my
wife
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Execrable
villain
!
"
exclaimed
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
hear
that
,
"
cried
Mrs.
Sheppard
;
"
he
swears
to
save
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
replied
her
son
;
"
and
you
spurn
the
proposal
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
;
she
accepts
it
,
"
rejoined
Jonathan
,
triumphantly
.
<EOS>
"
Come
along
,
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
I
've
a
carriage
within
call
<EOS>
shall
convey
you
swiftly
to
town
.
<EOS>
Come
!
<EOS>
come
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hear
me
,
mother
,
"
cried
Jack
,
"
and
I
will
explain
to
you
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
why
_
the
villain
makes
this
strange
and
revolting
proposal
.
<EOS>
He
well
knows
that
but
two
lives
--
those
of
Thames
Darrell
and
Sir
Rowland
Trenchard,--stand
between
you
and
the
vast
possessions
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
Those
lives
removed,--and
<EOS>
Sir
Rowland
is
completely
in
his
power
,
the
estates
would
be
yours
--
HIS
!
<EOS>
if
he
were
your
husband
.
<EOS>
Now
do
you
see
his
motive
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
nothing
but
your
danger
,
"
replied
his
mother
,
tenderly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Granted
it
were
as
you
say
,
Jack
,
"
said
Wild;--"and
<EOS>
I
sha'n't
take
the
trouble
to
contradict
you
--
the
estates
would
be
_
yours
_
hereafter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Liar
!
"
cried
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
affect
ignorance
that
I
am
a
condemned
felon
,
and
can
inherit
nothing
?
<EOS>
But
do
not
imagine
that
under
any
circumstances
I
would
accept
your
terms
.
<EOS>
My
mother
shall
never
degrade
herself
by
a
connection
with
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Degrade
herself
,
"
rejoined
Jonathan
,
brutally
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
think
I
would
take
a
harlot
to
my
bed
,
if
it
did
n't
suit
my
purposes
to
do
so
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
says
right
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
distractedly
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
only
fit
for
such
as
him
.
<EOS>
Take
me
!
<EOS>
take
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Before
an
hour
you
shall
be
mine
,
"
said
Jonathan
advancing
towards
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Back
!
"
cried
Jack
fiercely
:
<EOS>
"
lay
a
finger
on
her
,
and
I
will
fell
you
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Mother
!
<EOS>
do
you
know
what
you
do
?
<EOS>
Would
you
sell
yourself
to
this
fiend
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
sell
myself
,
body
and
soul
,
to
save
you
,
"
rejoined
his
mother
,
bursting
from
his
grasp
.
 
<EOS>
Jonathan
caught
her
in
his
arms
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
away
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
with
the
roar
of
a
demon
.
 
<EOS>
This
laugh
and
his
looks
alarmed
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
_
is
_
the
fiend
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
recoiling
.
"
<EOS>
Save
me!--save
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Damnation
!
"
<EOS>
vociferated
Jonathan
,
savagely
.
<EOS>
"
We
've
no
time
for
any
Bedlam
scenes
now
.
<EOS>
Come
along
,
you
mad
jade
.
<EOS>
I
'll
teach
you
submission
in
time
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
he
endeavoured
to
force
her
off
;
but
,
before
he
could
accomplish
his
purpose
,
he
was
arrested
,
and
<EOS>
his
throat
seized
by
Jack
.
<EOS>
In
the
struggle
,
Mrs.
Sheppard
broke
from
him
,
and
filled
the
room
with
her
shrieks
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
now
pay
the
debt
I
owe
you
,
"
cried
Jack
,
tightening
his
grip
till
the
thief
-
taker
blackened
in
the
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dog
!
"
cried
Wild
,
freeing
himself
by
a
powerful
effort
,
and
dealing
Jack
a
violent
blow
with
the
heavy
bludgeon
,
which
knocked
him
backwards
,
"
you
are
not
yet
a
match
for
Jonathan
Wild
.
<EOS>
Neither
you
nor
your
mother
shall
escape
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
summon
my
janizaries
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
raised
a
whistle
to
his
lips
,
and
blew
a
loud
call
;
and
,
as
this
was
unanswered
,
another
still
louder
.
"
Confusion
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
;
"
something
has
happened
.
<EOS>
But
I
wo
n't
be
cheated
of
my
prize
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Help
!
<EOS>
help
!
<EOS>
"
shrieked
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
fleeing
from
him
to
the
farthest
corner
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
of
no
avail
.
<EOS>
Jonathan
again
seized
her
,
when
the
door
was
thrown
open
,
and
Thames
Darrell
,
followed
by
Mr.
Wood
and
several
serving
-
men
,
all
well
armed
,
rushed
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
A
glance
sufficed
to
show
the
young
man
how
matters
stood
.
<EOS>
He
flew
to
the
window
,
and
would
have
passed
his
sword
through
the
thief
-
taker
's
body
,
if
the
latter
had
not
quickly
interposed
the
person
of
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
so
that
if
the
blow
had
been
stricken
she
must
have
received
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Quilt!--Mendez!--Where
are
you
?
"
<EOS>
vociferated
Wild
,
sounding
his
whistle
for
the
third
time
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
call
in
vain
,
"
rejoined
Thames
.
"
<EOS>
Your
assistants
are
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
Yield
,
villain
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
!
"
replied
Jonathan
.
 
<EOS>
"
Put
down
your
burthen
,
monster
!
"
shouted
Wood
,
pointing
an
immense
blunderbuss
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
her
,
"
cried
Jonathan
;
and
,
flinging
the
now
inanimate
body
of
the
poor
widow
,
who
had
fainted
in
the
struggle
,
into
the
arms
of
Thames
<EOS>
,
he
leapt
through
the
window
,
and
by
the
time
the
latter
could
consign
her
to
Wood
,
and
dart
after
him
,
he
had
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pursue
him
,
"
cried
Thames
to
the
attendants
,
"
and
see
that
he
does
not
escape
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
order
was
promptly
obeyed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Jack
,
"
continued
Thames
,
addressing
Sheppard
,
who
had
only
just
recovered
from
the
blow
,
and
regained
his
feet
,
"
<EOS>
I
do
n't
ask
_
how
_
you
came
here
,
nor
do
I
blame
your
rashness
in
doing
so
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
,
ever
since
Wild
's
late
murderous
attack
,
the
household
has
all
been
well
armed
.
<EOS>
A
post
-
chaise
seen
in
the
road
first
alarmed
us
.
<EOS>
On
searching
the
grounds
,
we
found
two
suspicious
-
looking
fellows
in
the
garden
,
and
had
scarcely
secured
them
,
when
your
mother
's
cries
summoned
us
hither
,
just
in
time
to
preserve
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
arrival
was
most
providential
,
"
said
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
remain
here
another
instant
,
"
replied
Thames
.
<EOS>
"
My
horse
is
at
the
door
,
saddled
,
with
pistols
in
the
holsters,--mount
him
and
fly
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Thames
,
I
have
much
to
say
,
"
said
Jack
,
"
much
that
concerns
your
safety
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
now
,
"
returned
Thames
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"
I
cannot
--
will
not
suffer
you
to
remain
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
,
if
you
will
consent
to
meet
me
at
midnight
near
the
old
house
in
Wych
Street
,
"
replied
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
By
that
time
,
I
shall
have
fully
considered
a
plan
which
occurs
to
me
for
defeating
the
schemes
of
your
enemies
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Before
that
time
you
will
be
captured
,
if
you
expose
yourself
thus
,
"
rejoined
Thames
.
"
<EOS>
However
,
I
will
be
there
.
<EOS>
Farewell
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Till
midnight
,
"
replied
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
And
imprinting
a
kiss
upon
his
mother
's
cold
lips
,
he
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
found
the
horse
where
Thames
told
him
he
would
find
him
,
mounted
,
and
rode
off
across
the
fields
in
the
direction
of
town
.

CHAPTER
XII
.
 
<EOS>
The
Well
Hole
.
  
<EOS>
Jonathan
Wild
's
first
object
,
as
soon
as
he
had
made
good
his
retreat
,
was
to
ascertain
what
had
become
of
his
janizaries
,
and
,
if
possible
,
to
release
them
.
<EOS>
With
this
view
,
he
hurried
to
the
spot
where
he
had
left
the
post
-
chaise
,
and
found
it
drawn
up
at
the
road
-
side
,
the
postilion
dismounted
,
and
in
charge
of
a
couple
of
farming
-
men
.
<EOS>
Advancing
towards
them
,
sword
in
hand
,
Jonathan
so
terrified
the
hinds
by
his
fierce
looks
and
determined
manner
,
that
,
after
a
slight
show
of
resistance
,
they
took
to
their
heels
,
leaving
him
master
of
the
field
.
<EOS>
He
then
threw
open
the
door
of
the
vehicle
,
in
which
he
found
his
janizaries
with
their
arms
pinioned
,
and
,
leaping
into
it
,
ordered
the
man
to
drive
off
.
<EOS>
The
postilion
obeyed
,
and
dashed
off
as
hard
as
his
horses
could
gallop
along
the
beautiful
road
leading
to
Neasdon
and
Willesden
,
just
as
the
serving
-
men
made
their
appearance
.
<EOS>
Arrived
at
the
latter
place
,
Jonathan
,
who
,
meanwhile
,
had
contrived
to
liberate
his
attendants
from
their
bonds
,
drew
up
at
the
Six
Bells
,
and
hiring
a
couple
of
horses
,
despatched
his
attendants
in
search
of
Jack
Sheppard
,
while
he
proceeded
to
town
.
<EOS>
Dismissing
the
post
-
chaise
at
the
Old
Bailey
,
he
walked
to
Newgate
to
ascertain
what
had
occurred
since
the
escape
.
<EOS>
It
was
just
upon
the
stroke
of
nine
as
he
entered
the
Lodge
,
and
Mr.
Austin
was
dismissing
a
host
of
inquirers
who
had
been
attracted
thither
by
the
news,--for
<EOS>
it
had
already
been
extensively
noised
abroad
.
<EOS>
Some
of
these
persons
were
examining
the
spot
where
the
spike
had
been
cut
off
;
others
the
spike
itself
,
now
considered
a
remarkable
object
;
and
all
were
marvelling
how
Jack
could
have
possibly
squeezed
himself
through
such
a
narrow
aperture
,
until
it
was
explained
to
them
by
Mr.
Austin
that
the
renowned
housebreaker
was
of
slender
bodily
conformation
,
and
therefore
able
to
achieve
a
feat
,
which
he
,
Mr.
Austin
,
or
any
man
of
similar
dimensions
,
would
have
found
wholly
impossible
.
<EOS>
Affixed
to
the
wall
,
in
a
conspicuous
situation
,
was
a
large
placard
,
which
,
after
minutely
describing
Sheppard
's
appearance
and
attire
,
concluded
thus:--"_Whoever
will
discover
or
apprehend
the
above
_
JOHN
SHEPPARD
,
_
so
that
he
be
brought
to
justice
,
shall
receive
_
ONE
HUNDRED
GUINEAS
REWARD
,
_
to
be
paid
by
_
MR
.
<EOS>
PITT
,
_
<EOS>
the
keeper
of
Newgate
_
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
This
placard
attracted
universal
attention
.
<EOS>
While
Jonathan
was
conversing
with
Austin
,
from
whom
he
took
care
to
conceal
the
fact
of
his
having
seen
Sheppard
since
his
escape
,
Ireton
entered
the
Lodge
.
 
<EOS>
"
Altogether
unsuccessful
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
chief
turnkey
,
with
a
look
of
disappointment
,
not
unmixed
with
apprehension
,
as
he
approached
Wild
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
been
to
all
the
flash
cases
in
town
,
and
can
hear
nothing
of
him
or
his
wives
.
<EOS>
First
,
I
went
to
Country
Tom
's
,
the
Goat
,
in
Long
Lane
.
<EOS>
Tom
swore
he
had
n't
set
eyes
on
him
since
the
trial
.
<EOS>
I
next
proceeded
to
Jenny
Bunch
's
,
the
Ship
,
in
Trig
Lane
--
there
I
got
the
same
answer
.
<EOS>
Then
to
the
Feathers
,
in
Drury
Lane
.
<EOS>
Then
to
the
Golden
Ball
,
in
the
same
street
.
<EOS>
Then
to
Martin
's
brandy
-
shop
,
in
Fleet
Street
.
<EOS>
Then
to
Dan
Ware
's
,
in
Hanging
Sword
Court
.
<EOS>
Then
to
the
Dean
's
Head
,
in
St.
Martin
's
Le
Grand
.
<EOS>
And
,
lastly
,
to
the
Seven
Cities
o
'
Refuge
,
in
the
New
Mint
.
<EOS>
And
nowhere
could
I
obtain
the
slightest
information
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
"
exclaimed
Wild
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
been
more
successful
,
Sir
?
<EOS>
"
ventured
Ireton
.
 
<EOS>
Jonathan
shook
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Shotbolt
thinks
he
has
a
scheme
that
ca
n't
fail
,
"
interposed
Austin
;
"
but
he
wishes
to
know
whether
you
'll
be
as
good
as
your
word
,
in
respect
to
the
great
reward
you
offered
for
Jack
's
capture
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Have
I
ever
broken
my
word
in
such
matters
,
that
he
dares
put
the
question
?
"
rejoined
Jonathan
sternly
.
"
<EOS>
Tell
Mr.
Shotbolt
that
if
he
,
or
any
other
person
,
takes
Jack
Sheppard
before
to
-
morrow
morning
,
I
'll
double
it
.
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Austin
respectfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
Two
hundred
pounds
,
if
he
's
lodged
in
Newgate
before
to
-
morrow
morning
,
"
continued
Wild
.
"
<EOS>
Make
it
known
among
your
friends
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
strode
out
of
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
"
Two
hundred
pounds
!
"
exclaimed
Ireton
,
"
besides
the
governor
's
offer
--
that
's
three
hundred
.
<EOS>
I
must
go
to
work
again
.
<EOS>
Keep
a
sharp
look
out
,
Austin
,
and
see
that
we
lose
no
one
else
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
sorry
if
Shotbolt
got
the
reward
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Devilish
hard
!
<EOS>
I
'm
not
allowed
a
chance
,
"
grumbled
Austin
,
as
he
was
left
alone
.
"
<EOS>
However
,
some
one
_
must
_
look
after
the
jail
;
and
they
're
all
gone
but
<EOS>
me
.
<EOS>
It
's
fortunate
<EOS>
we
've
no
more
Jack
Sheppards
,
or
I
should
stand
but
a
poor
chance
.
<EOS>
Well
,
I
do
n't
think
they
'll
any
of
'em
nab
him
<EOS>
,
that
's
one
comfort
.
"
 
<EOS>
On
quitting
the
Lodge
,
Wild
repaired
to
his
own
habitation
.
<EOS>
Telling
the
porter
that
he
would
attend
to
the
house
himself
,
he
bade
him
go
in
search
of
Jack
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
Jonathan
's
manner
,
as
he
issued
this
command
,
that
struck
the
man
as
singular
,
and
he
afterwards
recalled
it
.
<EOS>
He
,
however
,
made
no
remark
at
the
time
,
but
instantly
prepared
to
set
out
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
was
gone
,
Jonathan
went
up
stairs
to
the
audience
-
chamber
;
and
,
sitting
down
,
appeared
for
some
time
buried
in
reflection
.
<EOS>
The
dark
and
desperate
thoughts
that
were
passing
through
his
mind
at
this
time
will
presently
be
shown
.
<EOS>
After
a
while
,
he
raised
his
eyes
;
and
,
if
their
glance
could
have
been
witnessed
at
the
moment
,
it
could
not
have
been
easily
forgotten
.
<EOS>
Muttering
something
to
himself
,
he
appeared
to
be
telling
upon
his
fingers
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
some
scheme
he
had
in
contemplation
.
<EOS>
That
he
had
resolved
upon
its
execution
,
whatever
it
might
be
,
was
evident
from
his
saying
aloud,--
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
it
.
<EOS>
So
good
an
opportunity
may
never
occur
again
.
"
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
he
arose
,
and
paced
the
room
hastily
backwards
and
forwards
,
as
if
further
arranging
his
plans
.
<EOS>
He
then
unlocked
a
cabinet
,
opened
a
secret
drawer
,
and
,
lifter
ransacking
its
contents
,
discovered
a
paper
he
was
in
search
of
,
and
a
glove
.
<EOS>
Laying
these
carefully
aside
,
he
restored
the
drawer
to
its
place
.
<EOS>
His
next
occupation
was
to
take
out
his
pistols
,
examine
the
priming
,
and
rub
the
flints
.
<EOS>
His
sword
then
came
in
for
his
scrutiny
:
he
felt
at
,
and
appeared
satisfied
with
its
edge
.
<EOS>
This
employment
seemed
to
afford
him
the
highest
satisfaction
;
for
a
diabolical
grin
--
it
can
not
be
called
a
smile
--
played
upon
his
face
all
the
time
he
was
engaged
in
it
.
<EOS>
His
sword
done
with
,
he
took
up
the
bludgeon
;
balanced
it
in
his
hand
;
upon
the
points
of
his
fingers
;
and
let
it
fall
with
a
smash
,
intentionally
,
upon
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
"
After
all
,
"
he
said
,
"
this
is
the
safest
weapon
.
<EOS>
No
instrument
I
've
ever
used
has
done
me
such
good
service
.
<EOS>
It
_
shall
_
be
the
bludgeon
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
slung
it
upon
his
wrist
.
 
<EOS>
Taking
up
a
link
,
which
was
blazing
beside
him
,
he
walked
across
the
room
;
and
touching
a
spring
in
the
wall
,
a
secret
door
flew
open
.
<EOS>
Beyond
was
a
narrow
bridge
,
crossing
a
circular
building
,
at
the
bottom
of
which
lay
a
deep
well
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
dark
mysterious
place
,
and
what
it
was
used
for
no
one
exactly
knew
;
but
it
was
called
by
those
who
had
seen
it
the
Well
Hole
.
<EOS>
The
bridge
was
protected
on
either
side
by
a
railing
with
bannisters
placed
at
wide
intervals
.
<EOS>
Steps
to
aid
the
descent
,
which
was
too
steep
to
be
safe
without
them
,
led
to
,
a
door
on
the
opposite
side
.
<EOS>
This
door
,
which
was
open
,
Jonathan
locked
and
took
out
the
key
.
<EOS>
As
he
stood
upon
the
bridge
,
he
held
down
the
light
,
and
looked
into
the
profound
abyss
.
<EOS>
The
red
glare
fell
upon
the
slimy
brick
-
work
,
and
tinged
the
inky
waters
below
.
<EOS>
A
slight
cough
uttered
by
Jonathan
at
the
moment
awakened
the
echoes
of
the
place
,
and
was
returned
in
hollow
reverberations
.
<EOS>
"
There
'll
be
a
louder
echo
here
presently
,
"
thought
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
Before
leaving
the
place
he
looked
upwards
,
and
could
just
discern
the
blue
vault
and
pale
stars
of
Heaven
through
an
iron
grating
at
the
top
.
 
<EOS>
On
his
return
to
the
room
,
Jonathan
purposely
left
the
door
of
the
Well
Hole
ajar
.
<EOS>
Unlocking
a
cupboard
,
he
then
took
out
some
cold
meat
and
other
viands
,
with
a
flask
of
wine
,
and
a
bottle
of
brandy
,
and
began
to
eat
and
drink
voraciously
.
<EOS>
He
had
very
nearly
cleared
the
board
,
when
a
knock
was
heard
below
,
and
descending
at
the
summons
,
he
found
his
two
janizaries
.
<EOS>
They
had
both
been
unsuccessful
.
<EOS>
As
Jonathan
scarcely
expected
a
more
satisfactory
result
,
he
made
no
comment
;
but
,
ordering
Quilt
to
continue
his
search
,
and
not
to
return
until
he
had
found
the
fugitive
,
called
Abraham
Mendez
into
the
house
,
and
shut
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
want
you
for
the
job
I
spoke
of
a
short
time
ago
,
Nab
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
have
no
one
but
yourself
in
it
.
<EOS>
Come
up
stairs
,
and
take
a
glass
of
brandy
.
"
 
<EOS>
Abraham
grinned
,
and
silently
followed
his
master
,
who
,
as
soon
as
they
reached
the
audience
-
chamber
,
poured
out
a
bumper
of
spirits
,
and
presented
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
Jew
swallowed
it
at
a
draught
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
my
shoul
!
"
he
exclaimed
,
smacking
his
lips
,
"
dat
ish
goot
--
very
goot
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
finish
the
bottle
when
the
job
's
done
,
"
replied
Jonathan
.
 
<EOS>
"
Vat
ish
it
,
Mishter
Vild
?
"
inquired
Mendez
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shir
Rowland
Trenchard
's
affair
--
eh
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
it
<EOS>
,
"
rejoined
Jonathan
;
"
I
expect
him
here
every
minute
.
<EOS>
When
you
've
admitted
him
,
steal
into
the
room
,
hide
yourself
,
and
do
n't
move
till
I
utter
the
words
,
'
<EOS>
You
've
a
long
journey
before
you
.
'
<EOS>
That
's
your
signal
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
a
famoush
goot
shignal
it
ish
,
"
laughed
Abraham
.
"
<EOS>
He
hash
a
long
journey
before
him
--
ha
!
ha
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Peace
!
"
cried
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
his
knock
.
<EOS>
Go
,
and
let
him
in
.
<EOS>
And
mind
you
do
n't
arouse
his
suspicions
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
fear
--
never
fear
,
"
rejoined
Abraham
,
as
he
took
up
the
link
,
and
left
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
Jonathan
cast
a
hasty
glance
around
,
to
see
that
all
was
properly
arranged
for
his
purpose
;
placed
a
chair
with
its
back
to
the
door
;
disposed
the
lights
on
the
table
so
as
to
throw
the
entrance
of
the
room
more
into
shadow
;
and
then
flung
himself
into
a
seat
to
await
Sir
Rowland
's
arrival
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
not
to
wait
long
.
<EOS>
Enveloped
in
a
large
cloak
,
Sir
Rowland
stalked
into
the
room
,
and
took
the
seat
assigned
him
;
while
the
Jew
,
who
received
a
private
signal
from
Jonathan
,
set
down
the
link
near
the
entrance
of
the
Well
Hole
,
and
,
having
made
fast
the
door
,
crept
behind
one
of
the
cases
.
 
<EOS>
Fancying
they
were
alone
,
Sir
Rowland
threw
aside
his
cloak
,
and
produced
a
heavy
bag
of
money
,
which
he
flung
upon
the
table
;
and
,
when
Wild
had
feasted
his
greedy
eyes
sufficiently
upon
its
golden
contents
,
he
handed
him
a
pocket
-
book
filled
with
notes
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
behaved
like
a
man
of
honour
,
Sir
Rowland
,
"
said
Wild
,
after
he
had
twice
told
over
the
money
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Right
to
a
farthing
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Give
me
an
acquittance
,
"
said
Trenchard
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
scarcely
necessary
,
"
replied
Wild
;
"
however
,
if
you
require
it
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
There
it
is
.
'
<EOS>
Received
from
Sir
Rowland
Trenchard
,
15,000
£
.--Jonathan
<EOS>
Wild
:
<EOS>
August
31st
,
1724
.
'
<EOS>
Will
that
do
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
will
,
"
replied
Trenchard
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
our
last
transaction
together
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
"
replied
Wild
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
last
,
"
continued
the
knight
,
sternly
;
"
and
I
trust
we
may
never
meet
again
,
I
have
paid
you
this
large
sum
--
not
because
you
are
entitled
to
it
,
for
you
have
failed
in
what
you
undertook
to
do
,
but
because
I
desire
to
be
troubled
with
you
no
further
.
<EOS>
I
have
now
settled
my
affairs
,
and
made
every
preparation
for
my
departure
to
France
,
where
I
shall
spend
the
remainder
of
my
days
.
<EOS>
And
I
have
made
such
arrangements
that
at
my
decease
tardy
justice
will
be
done
my
injured
nephew
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
made
no
such
arrangements
as
will
compromise
me
,
I
hope
,
Sir
Rowland
?
"
said
Wild
,
hastily
.
 
<EOS>
"
While
I
live
you
are
safe
,
"
rejoined
Trenchard
;
"
after
my
death
I
can
answer
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
'
Sblood
!
"
exclaimed
Wild
,
uneasily
.
"
<EOS>
This
alters
the
case
materially
.
<EOS>
When
were
you
last
confessed
,
Sir
Rowland
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
abruptly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
ask
?
"
rejoined
the
other
haughtily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Because
--
because
I
'm
always
distrustful
of
a
priest
,
"
rejoined
Jonathan
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
parted
from
one
,
"
said
Trenchard
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
much
the
worse
,
"
replied
Jonathan
,
rising
and
taking
a
turn
,
as
if
uncertain
what
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
much
the
better
,
"
rejoined
Sir
Rowland
.
<EOS>
"
He
who
stands
on
the
verge
of
the
grave
,
as
I
do
,
should
never
be
unprepared
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
strangely
superstitious
,
Sir
Rowland
,
"
said
Jonathan
,
halting
,
and
looking
steadfastly
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
were
so
,
I
should
not
be
here
,
"
returned
Trenchard
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
so
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Wild
,
curiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
had
a
terrible
dream
last
night
.
<EOS>
I
thought
my
sister
and
her
murdered
husband
dragged
me
hither
,
to
this
very
room
,
and
commanded
you
to
slay
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
terrible
dream
,
indeed
,
"
said
Jonathan
thoughtfully
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
must
n't
indulge
these
gloomy
thoughts
.
<EOS>
Let
me
recommend
a
glass
of
wine
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
penance
forbids
it
,
"
said
Trenchard
,
waving
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
remain
here
long
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
remain
longer
than
you
anticipate
,
"
muttered
Wild
.
 
<EOS>
"
Before
I
go
,
"
continued
Sir
Rowland
,
"
I
must
beg
of
you
to
disclose
to
me
all
you
know
relative
to
the
parentage
of
Thames
Darrell
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Willingly
,
"
replied
Wild
.
<EOS>
"
Thinking
it
likely
you
might
desire
to
have
this
information
,
I
prepared
accordingly
.
<EOS>
First
,
look
at
this
glove
.
<EOS>
It
belonged
to
his
father
,
and
was
worn
by
him
on
the
night
he
was
murdered
.
<EOS>
You
will
observe
that
a
coronet
is
embroidered
on
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
"
exclaimed
Trenchard
,
starting
,
"
is
he
so
highly
born
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
This
letter
will
inform
you
,
"
replied
Wild
,
placing
a
document
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
this
!
"
cried
Sir
Rowland
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
the
hand
--
ha
!
<EOS>
my
friend
!
<EOS>
and
I
have
murdered
_
him
_
!
<EOS>
And
my
sister
was
thus
nobly
,
thus
illustriously
wedded
.
<EOS>
O
God
!
<EOS>
O
God
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
appeared
convulsed
with
agony
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
if
I
had
known
this
,
"
he
exclaimed
,
"
what
guilt
,
what
remorse
might
have
been
spared
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Repentance
comes
too
late
when
the
deed
's
done
,
"
returned
Wild
,
bitterly
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
too
late
to
repair
the
wrong
I
have
done
my
nephew
,
"
cried
Trenchard
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
set
about
it
instantly
.
<EOS>
He
shall
have
the
estates
.
<EOS>
I
will
return
to
Manchester
at
once
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
take
some
refreshment
before
you
start
,
"
rejoined
Wild
.
"
<EOS>
'
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
You
've
a
long
journey
before
you
.
<EOS>
_
'
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
As
the
signal
was
given
,
the
Jew
,
who
had
been
some
time
in
expectation
of
it
,
darted
swiftly
and
silently
behind
Sir
Rowland
,
and
flung
a
cloth
over
his
head
,
while
Jonathan
,
rushing
upon
him
in
front
,
struck
him
several
quick
and
violent
blows
in
the
face
with
the
bludgeon
.
<EOS>
The
white
cloth
was
instantly
dyed
with
crimson
;
but
,
regardless
of
this
,
Jonathan
continued
his
murderous
assault
.
<EOS>
The
struggles
of
the
wounded
man
were
desperate
--
so
desperate
,
that
in
his
agony
he
overset
the
table
,
and
,
in
the
confusion
,
tore
off
the
cloth
,
and
disclosed
a
face
horribly
mutilated
,
and
streaming
with
blood
.
<EOS>
So
appalling
was
the
sight
,
that
even
the
murderers
--
familiar
as
they
were
with
scenes
of
slaughter,--looked
aghast
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
During
this
dreadful
pause
the
wretched
man
felt
for
his
sword
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
removed
from
the
scabbard
by
the
Jew
.
<EOS>
He
uttered
a
deep
groan
,
but
said
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
"
Despatch
him
!
"
<EOS>
roared
Jonathan
.
 
<EOS>
Having
no
means
of
defence
,
Sir
Rowland
cleared
the
blood
from
his
vision
;
and
,
turning
to
see
whether
there
was
any
means
of
escape
,
he
descried
the
open
door
behind
him
leading
to
the
Well
Hole
,
and
instantly
darted
through
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
I
could
wish
!
"
cried
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
Bring
the
light
,
Nab
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
Jew
snatched
up
the
link
,
and
followed
him
.
 
<EOS>
A
struggle
of
the
most
terrific
kind
now
ensued
.
<EOS>
The
wounded
man
had
descended
the
bridge
,
and
dashed
himself
against
the
door
beyond
it
;
but
,
finding
it
impossible
to
force
his
way
further
,
he
turned
to
confront
his
assailants
.
<EOS>
Jonathan
aimed
a
blow
at
him
,
which
,
if
it
had
taken
place
,
must
have
instantly
terminated
the
strife
;
but
,
avoiding
this
,
he
sprang
at
the
thief
-
taker
,
and
grappled
with
him
.
<EOS>
Firmly
built
,
as
it
was
,
the
bridge
creaked
in
such
a
manner
with
their
contending
efforts
,
that
Abraham
durst
not
venture
beyond
the
door
,
where
he
stood
,
holding
the
light
,
a
horrified
spectator
of
the
scene
.
<EOS>
The
contest
,
however
,
though
desperate
,
was
brief
.
<EOS>
Disengaging
his
right
arm
,
Jonathan
struck
his
victim
a
tremendous
blow
on
the
head
with
the
bludgeon
,
that
fractured
his
skull
;
and
,
exerting
all
his
strength
,
threw
him
over
the
rails
,
to
which
he
clung
with
the
tenacity
of
despair
.
 
<EOS>
"
Spare
me
!
"
<EOS>
he
groaned
,
looking
upwards
.
"
<EOS>
Spare
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
Jonathan
,
however
,
instead
of
answering
him
,
searched
for
his
knife
,
with
the
intention
of
severing
his
wrist
.
<EOS>
But
not
finding
it
,
he
had
again
recourse
to
the
bludgeon
,
and
began
beating
the
hand
fixed
on
the
upper
rail
,
until
,
by
smashing
the
fingers
,
he
forced
it
to
relinquish
its
hold
.
<EOS>
He
then
stamped
upon
the
hand
on
the
lower
bannister
,
until
that
also
relaxed
its
gripe
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Rowland
then
fell
.
 
<EOS>
A
hollow
plunge
,
echoed
and
re
-
echoed
by
the
walls
,
marked
his
descent
into
the
water
.
 
<EOS>
"
Give
me
the
link
,
"
cried
Jonathan
.
 
<EOS>
Holding
down
the
light
,
he
perceived
that
the
wounded
man
had
risen
to
the
surface
,
and
was
trying
to
clamber
up
the
slippery
sides
of
the
well
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shoot
him
!
<EOS>
shoot
him
!
<EOS>
Put
him
out
of
hish
mishery
,
"
cried
the
Jew
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
use
of
wasting
a
shot
?
"
rejoined
Jonathan
,
savagely
.
"
<EOS>
He
ca
n't
get
out
.
"
 
<EOS>
After
making
several
ineffectual
attempts
to
keep
himself
above
water
,
Sir
Rowland
sunk
,
and
his
groans
,
which
had
become
gradually
fainter
and
fainter
,
were
heard
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
"
All
's
over
,
"
muttered
Jonathan
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
ve
go
back
to
de
other
room
?
"
asked
the
Jew
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
breathe
more
freely
dere
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Christ
!
<EOS>
de
door
's
shut
!
<EOS>
It
musht
have
schwung
to
during
de
schuffle
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Shut
!
"
exclaimed
Wild
.
<EOS>
"
Then
we
're
imprisoned
.
<EOS>
The
spring
ca
n't
be
opened
on
this
side
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Dere
's
de
other
door
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mendez
,
in
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
only
leads
to
the
fencing
crib
,
"
replied
Wild
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
outlet
that
way
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ca
n't
ve
call
for
asshistanche
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
who
'll
find
us
,
if
we
do
?
"
rejoined
Wild
,
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
But
they
_
will
_
find
the
evidences
of
slaughter
in
the
other
room,--the
table
<EOS>
upset,--the
bloody
<EOS>
cloth,--the
dead
man
's
sword,--the
money,--and
<EOS>
my
memorandum
,
which
I
forgot
to
remove
.
<EOS>
Hell
's
curses
!
<EOS>
that
after
all
my
precautions
I
should
be
thus
entrapped
.
<EOS>
It
's
all
your
fault
,
you
shaking
coward
!
<EOS>
and
,
but
that
I
feel
sure
you
'll
swing
for
your
carelessness
,
I
'd
throw
you
into
the
well
,
too

CHAPTER
XIII
.
 
<EOS>
The
Supper
at
Mr.
Kneebone
's
.
  
<EOS>
Persuaded
that
Jack
Sheppard
would
keep
his
appointment
with
Mr.
Kneebone
,
and
feeling
certain
of
capturing
him
if
he
did
so
,
Shotbolt
,
on
quitting
Newgate
,
hurried
to
the
New
Prison
to
prepare
for
the
enterprise
.
<EOS>
After
debating
with
himself
for
some
time
whether
he
should
employ
an
assistant
,
or
make
the
attempt
alone
,
his
love
of
gain
overcame
his
fears
,
and
he
decided
upon
the
latter
plan
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
having
armed
himself
with
various
weapons
,
including
a
stout
oaken
staff
then
ordinarily
borne
by
the
watch
,
and
put
a
coil
of
rope
and
a
gag
in
his
pocket
,
to
be
ready
in
case
of
need
,
he
set
out
,
about
ten
o'clock
,
on
the
expedition
.
 
<EOS>
Before
proceeding
to
Wych
Street
,
he
called
at
the
Lodge
to
see
how
matters
were
going
on
,
and
found
Mrs.
Spurling
and
Austin
at
their
evening
meal
,
with
Caliban
in
attendance
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mr.
Shotbolt
,
"
cried
the
turnkey
,
"
I
've
good
news
for
you
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wild
has
doubled
his
offer
,
and
the
governor
has
likewise
proclaimed
a
reward
of
one
hundred
guineas
for
Jack
's
apprehension
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
say
so
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Shotbolt
.
 
<EOS>
"
Read
that
,
"
rejoined
Austin
,
pointing
to
the
placard
.
<EOS>
"
I
ought
to
tell
you
that
Mr.
Wild
's
reward
is
conditional
upon
<EOS>
Jack
's
being
taken
before
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
So
I
fear
there
's
little
chance
of
any
one
getting
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
think
so
,
eh
?
"
chuckled
Shotbolt
,
who
was
eagerly
perusing
the
reward
,
and
congratulating
himself
upon
his
caution
;
"
you
think
so
--
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
Well
,
do
n't
go
to
bed
,
that
's
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
for
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
turnkey
.
 
<EOS>
"
Because
the
prisoner
's
arrival
might
disturb
you
--
ha
!
ha
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
lay
you
twenty
guineas
<EOS>
you
do
n't
take
him
to
-
night
,
"
rejoined
Austin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Done
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Shotbolt
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Spurling
,
you
're
a
witness
to
the
bet
.
<EOS>
Twenty
guineas
,
mind
.
<EOS>
I
sha
n't
let
you
off
a
farthing
.
<EOS>
Egad
!
<EOS>
I
shall
make
a
good
thing
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
count
your
chickens
till
they
're
hatched
,
"
observed
Mrs.
Spurling
,
drily
.
 
<EOS>
"
_
<EOS>
My
_
chickens
are
hatched
,
or
,
at
least
,
nearly
so
,
"
replied
Shotbolt
,
with
increased
merriment
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Get
ready
your
heaviest
irons
,
Austin
.
<EOS>
I
'll
send
you
word
when
I
catch
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
'd
better
send
_
him
_
,
"
jeered
the
turnkey
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
I
will
,
"
rejoined
Shotbolt
;
"
so
I
will
.
<EOS>
If
I
do
n't
,
you
shall
clap
me
in
the
Condemned
Hold
in
his
stead
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
,
for
the
pressent
--
<EOS>
ha
!
ha
!
"
<EOS>
And
,
laughing
loudly
at
his
own
facetiousness
,
he
quitted
the
Lodge
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
lay
my
life
<EOS>
he
's
gone
on
a
fox
-
and
-
goose
-
chase
to
Mr.
Kneebone
's
,
"
remarked
Austin
,
rising
to
fasten
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
n't
wonder
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Spurling
,
as
if
struck
by
a
sudden
idea
.
<EOS>
And
,
while
the
turnkey
was
busy
with
the
keys
,
she
whispered
to
the
black
,
"
Follow
him
,
Caliban
.
<EOS>
Take
care
<EOS>
he
do
n't
see
you,--and
bring
me
word
where
he
goes
,
and
what
he
does
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Iss
,
missis
,
"
grinned
the
black
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
so
good
as
to
let
Caliban
out
,
Mr.
Austin
,
"
continued
the
tapstress
;
"
he
's
only
going
on
an
errand
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Austin
readily
complied
with
her
request
.
<EOS>
As
he
returned
to
the
table
,
he
put
his
finger
to
his
nose
;
and
,
though
he
said
nothing
,
he
thought
he
had
a
much
better
chance
of
winning
his
wager
.
 
<EOS>
Unconscious
that
his
movements
were
watched
,
Shotbolt
,
meanwhile
,
hastened
towards
Wych
Street
.
<EOS>
On
the
way
,
he
hired
a
chair
with
a
couple
of
stout
porters
,
and
ordered
them
to
follow
him
.
<EOS>
Arrived
within
a
short
distance
of
his
destination
,
he
came
to
a
halt
,
and
pointing
out
a
dark
court
nearly
opposite
the
woollen
-
draper
's
abode
,
told
the
chairmen
to
wait
there
till
they
were
summoned
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
peace
-
officer
,
"
he
added
,
"
about
to
arrest
a
notorious
criminal
.
<EOS>
He
'll
be
brought
out
at
this
door
,
and
may
probably
make
some
resistance
.
<EOS>
But
you
must
get
him
into
the
chair
as
fast
as
you
can
,
and
hurry
off
to
Newgate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
what
'll
we
get
for
the
job
,
yer
hon'r
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
foremost
chairman
,
who
,
like
most
of
his
tribe
at
the
time
,
was
an
Irishman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Five
guineas
.
<EOS>
Here
's
a
couple
in
hand
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Faix
,
then
we
'll
do
it
in
style
,
"
cried
the
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
Once
in
this
chair
,
yer
hon'r
,
and
I
'll
warrant
he
'll
not
get
out
<EOS>
so
aisily
as
Jack
Sheppard
did
from
the
New
Pris'n
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Hold
your
tongue
,
sirrah
,
"
rejoined
Shotbolt
,
not
over
-
pleased
by
the
remark
,
"
and
mind
what
I
tell
you
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
what
's
that
?
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
as
some
one
brushed
hastily
past
him
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
n't
just
left
him
,
I
could
have
sworn
it
was
Mrs.
Spurling
's
sooty
imp
,
Caliban
.
"
 
<EOS>
Having
seen
the
chairmen
concealed
in
the
entry
,
Shotbolt
proceeded
to
Mr.
Kneebone
's
habitation
,
the
shutters
of
which
were
closed
,
and
knocked
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
The
summons
was
instantly
answered
by
a
shop
-
boy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
your
master
at
home
?
"
inquired
the
jailer
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
,
"
replied
a
portly
personage
,
arrayed
in
a
gorgeous
yellow
brocade
dressing
-
gown
,
lined
with
cherry
-
coloured
satin
,
and
having
a
crimson
velvet
cap
,
surmounted
by
a
gold
tassel
,
on
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
My
name
is
Kneebone
,
"
added
the
portly
personage
,
stepping
forward
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
with
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
word
in
private
,
"
replied
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stand
aside
,
Tom
,
"
commanded
Kneebone
.
"
<EOS>
Now
Sir
,
"
he
added
,
glancing
suspiciously
at
the
applicant
"
your
business
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
business
is
to
acquaint
you
that
Jack
Sheppard
has
escaped
,
Mr.
Kneebone
,
"
returned
Shotbolt
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
deuce
he
has
!
<EOS>
Why
,
it
's
only
a
few
hours
since
I
beheld
him
chained
down
with
half
a
hundred
weight
of
iron
,
in
the
strongest
ward
at
Newgate
.
<EOS>
It
's
almost
incredible
.
<EOS>
Are
you
sure
you
're
not
misinformed
,
Sir
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
in
the
Lodge
at
the
time
,
"
replied
the
jailer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
,
of
course
,
you
must
know
.
<EOS>
Well
,
it
's
scarcely
credible
.
<EOS>
When
I
gave
him
an
invitation
to
supper
,
I
little
thought
he
'd
accept
it
.
<EOS>
But
,
egad
!
<EOS>
I
believe
he
_
will
_
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
convinced
of
it
,
"
replied
Shotbolt
;
"
and
it
was
on
that
very
account
<EOS>
I
came
here
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
he
proceeded
to
unfold
his
scheme
to
the
woollen
-
draper
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Sir
,
"
said
Kneebone
,
when
the
other
concluded
,
"
I
shall
certainly
not
oppose
his
capture
,
but
<EOS>
,
at
the
same
time
,
I
'll
lend
you
no
assistance
.
<EOS>
If
he
keeps
_
his
_
word
,
I
'll
keep
_
mine
_
.
<EOS>
You
must
wait
till
supper
's
over
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
As
you
please
,
Sir,--provided
you
do
n't
let
him
off
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
I
'll
engage
not
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
've
another
reason
for
supposing
he
'll
pay
me
a
visit
.
<EOS>
I
refused
to
sign
a
petition
in
his
behalf
to
the
Recorder
;
not
from
any
ill
-
will
to
him
,
but
because
it
was
prepared
by
a
person
whom
I
particularly
dislike
--
Captain
Darrell
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
very
sufficient
reason
,
"
answered
the
jailer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tom
,
"
continued
Kneebone
,
calling
to
the
shop
-
boy
,
"
do
n't
go
home
.
<EOS>
I
may
want
you
.
<EOS>
Light
the
lantern
.
<EOS>
And
,
if
you
hear
any
odd
noise
in
the
parlour
,
do
n't
mind
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
in
the
least
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Tom
,
in
a
drowsy
tone
,
and
with
a
look
seeming
to
imply
that
he
was
too
much
accustomed
to
odd
noises
at
night
to
heed
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
step
this
way
,
Mr.
What's
-
your
-
name
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Shotbolt
,
Sir
,
"
replied
the
jailer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
Mr.
Slipshod
;
follow
me
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
led
the
way
to
an
inner
room
,
in
the
middle
of
which
stood
a
table
,
covered
with
a
large
white
cloth
.
 
<EOS>
"
Jack
Sheppard
knows
this
house
,
I
believe
,
Sir
,
"
observed
Shotbolt
.
 
<EOS>
"
Every
inch
of
it
,
"
replied
the
woollen
-
draper
.
"
<EOS>
He
_
ought
_
to
do
,
seeing
that
he
served
his
apprenticeship
in
it
to
Mr.
Wood
,
by
whom
it
was
formerly
occupied
.
<EOS>
His
name
is
carved
upon
a
beam
up
stairs
.
"
 
"
<EOS>
Indeed
!
"
said
Shotbolt
.
<EOS>
"
Where
can
I
hide
myself
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
glancing
round
the
room
in
search
of
a
closet
.
 
<EOS>
"
Under
the
table
.
<EOS>
The
cloth
nearly
touches
the
floor
.
<EOS>
Give
me
your
staff
.
<EOS>
It
'll
be
in
your
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Suppose
he
brings
Blueskin
,
or
some
other
ruffian
with
him
,
"
hesitated
the
jailer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Suppose
he
does
.
<EOS>
In
that
case
I
'll
help
you
.
<EOS>
We
shall
be
equally
matched
.
<EOS>
You
're
not
afraid
,
Mr.
Shoplatch
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
in
the
least
,
"
replied
Shotbolt
,
creeping
beneath
the
table
;
"
there
's
my
staff
.
<EOS>
Am
I
quite
hidden
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
quite;--keep
your
feet
in
.
<EOS>
Mind
<EOS>
you
do
n't
stir
till
supper
's
over
.
<EOS>
I
'll
stamp
twice
when
we
've
done
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
forgot
to
mention
there
's
a
trifling
reward
for
his
capture
,
"
cried
Shotbolt
,
popping
his
head
from
under
the
cloth
.
<EOS>
"
If
we
take
him
,
I
do
n't
mind
giving
you
a
share
--
say
a
fourth
--
provided
you
lend
a
helping
hand
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Curse
your
reward
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Kneebone
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
take
me
for
a
thief
-
catcher
,
like
Jonathan
Wild
,
that
you
dare
to
affront
me
by
such
a
proposal
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
offence
,
Sir
,
"
rejoined
the
jailer
,
humbly
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
imagine
for
a
moment
that
you
'd
accept
it
,
but
I
thought
it
right
to
make
you
the
offer
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Be
silent
,
and
conceal
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
'm
about
to
ring
for
supper
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
woollen
-
draper
's
application
to
the
bell
was
answered
by
a
very
pretty
young
woman
,
with
dark
Jewish
features
,
roguish
black
eyes
,
sleek
glossy
hair
,
a
trim
waist
,
and
a
remarkably
neat
figure
:
the
very
model
,
in
short
,
of
a
bachelor
's
housekeeper
.
 
<EOS>
"
Rachel
,
"
said
Mr.
Kneebone
,
addressing
his
comely
attendant
;
"
put
a
few
more
plates
on
the
table
,
and
bring
up
whatever
there
is
in
the
larder
.
<EOS>
I
expect
company
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Company
!
"
echoed
Rachel
;
"
at
this
time
of
night
?
<EOS>
"
 
"
Company
,
child
,
"
repeated
Kneebone
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
want
a
bottle
or
two
of
sack
,
and
a
flask
of
usquebaugh
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Anything
else
,
Sir
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No:--stay
!
<EOS>
you
'd
better
not
bring
up
any
silver
forks
or
spoons
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
surely
you
do
n't
think
your
guests
would
steal
them
,
"
observed
Rachel
,
archly
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
sha
n't
have
the
opportunity
,
"
replied
Kneebone
.
<EOS>
And
,
by
way
of
checking
his
housekeeper
's
familiarity
,
he
pointed
significantly
to
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
's
there
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Rachel
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
see
.
"
<EOS>
And
before
she
could
be
prevented
,
she
lifted
up
the
cloth
,
and
disclosed
Shotbolt
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Gemini
!
"
she
exclaimed
.
"
A
man
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
At
your
service
,
my
dear
,
"
replied
the
jailer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
your
curiosity
's
satisfied
,
child
,
"
continued
Kneebone
,
<EOS>
"
perhaps
,
you
'll
attend
to
my
orders
.
"
 
<EOS>
Not
a
little
perplexed
by
the
mysterious
object
she
had
seen
,
Rachel
left
the
room
,
and
,
shortly
afterwards
returned
with
the
materials
of
a
tolerably
good
supper;--to
wit
,
a
couple
of
cold
fowls
,
a
tongue
,
the
best
part
of
a
sirloin
of
beef
,
a
jar
of
pickles
,
and
two
small
dishes
of
pastry
.
<EOS>
To
these
she
added
the
wine
and
spirits
directed
,
and
when
all
was
arranged
looked
inquisitively
at
her
master
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
expect
a
very
extraordinary
person
to
supper
,
Rachel
,
"
he
remarked
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
gentleman
under
the
table
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
He
_
does
_
seem
a
very
extraordinary
person
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
;
another
still
more
extraordinary
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed!--who
is
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Jack
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
the
famous
housebreaker
.
<EOS>
I
thought
he
was
in
Newgate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
let
out
for
a
few
hours
,
"
laughed
Kneebone
;
"
but
he
's
going
back
again
after
supper
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear
!
<EOS>
how
I
should
like
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
I
'm
told
he
's
so
handsome
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sorry
I
ca
n't
indulge
you
,
"
replied
her
master
,
a
little
piqued
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
want
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
You
had
better
go
to
bed
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
no
use
going
to
bed
,
"
answered
Rachel
.
<EOS>
"
I
sha
n't
sleep
a
wink
while
Jack
Sheppard
's
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Keep
in
your
own
room
,
at
all
events
,
"
rejoined
Kneebone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
said
Rachel
,
with
a
toss
of
her
pretty
head
,
"
very
well
.
<EOS>
I
'll
have
a
peep
at
him
,
if
I
die
for
it
,
"
she
muttered
,
as
she
went
out
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Kneebone
,
then
,
sat
down
to
await
the
arrival
of
his
expected
guest
.
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
passed
,
but
Jack
did
not
make
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
The
woollen
-
draper
looked
at
his
watch
.
<EOS>
It
was
eleven
o'clock
.
<EOS>
Another
long
interval
elapsed
.
<EOS>
The
watch
was
again
consulted
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
a
quarter
past
twelve
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kneebone
,
who
began
to
feel
sleepy
,
wound
it
up
,
and
snuffed
the
candles
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
suspect
our
friend
has
thought
better
of
it
,
and
wo
n't
come
,
"
he
remarked
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
a
little
patience
,
Sir
,
"
rejoined
the
jailer
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
are
you
off
there
,
Shoplatch
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Kneebone
.
<EOS>
"
Rather
cramped
,
eh
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Rather
so
,
Sir
,
"
replied
the
other
,
altering
his
position
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
able
to
stretch
my
limbs
presently
--
<EOS>
ha
!
ha
!
"
 
"
Hush
!
"
cried
Kneebone
,
"
I
hear
a
noise
without
.
<EOS>
He
's
coming
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
caution
was
scarcely
uttered
,
when
the
door
opened
,
and
Jack
Sheppard
presented
himself
.
<EOS>
He
was
wrapped
in
a
laced
roquelaure
,
which
he
threw
off
on
his
entrance
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
already
intimated
that
Jack
had
an
excessive
passion
for
finery
;
and
it
might
have
been
added
,
that
the
chief
part
of
his
ill
-
gotten
gains
was
devoted
to
the
embellishment
of
his
person
.
<EOS>
On
the
present
occasion
,
he
appeared
to
have
bestowed
more
than
ordinary
attention
on
his
toilette
.
<EOS>
His
apparel
was
sumptuous
in
the
extreme
,
and
such
as
was
only
worn
by
persons
of
the
highest
distinction
.
<EOS>
It
consisted
of
a
full
-
dress
coat
of
brown
flowered
velvet
,
laced
with
silver
;
a
waistcoat
of
white
satin
,
likewise
richly
embroidered
;
shoes
with
red
heels
,
and
large
diamond
buckles
;
pearl
-
coloured
silk
stockings
with
gold
clocks
;
a
muslin
cravat
,
or
steen
-
kirk
,
as
it
was
termed
,
edged
with
the
fine
point
lace
;
ruffles
of
the
same
material
,
and
so
ample
as
almost
to
hide
the
tips
of
his
fingers
;
and
a
silver
-
hilted
sword
.
<EOS>
This
costume
,
though
somewhat
extravagant
,
displayed
his
slight
,
but
perfectly
-
proportioned
figure
to
the
greatest
advantage
.
<EOS>
The
only
departure
which
he
made
from
the
fashion
of
the
period
,
was
in
respect
to
the
peruke
--
an
article
he
could
never
be
induced
to
wear
.
<EOS>
In
lieu
of
it
,
he
still
adhered
to
the
sleek
black
crop
,
which
,
throughout
life
,
formed
a
distinguishing
feature
in
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
Ever
since
the
discovery
of
his
relationship
to
the
Trenchard
family
,
a
marked
change
had
taken
place
in
Jack
's
demeanour
and
looks
,
which
were
so
much
refined
and
improved
that
he
could
scarcely
be
recognised
as
the
same
person
.
<EOS>
Having
only
seen
him
in
the
gloom
of
a
dungeon
,
and
loaded
with
fetters
,
Kneebone
had
not
noticed
this
alteration
:
but
he
was
now
greatly
struck
by
it
.
<EOS>
Advancing
towards
him
,
he
made
him
a
formal
salutation
,
which
was
coldly
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
expected
,
I
find
,
"
observed
Jack
,
glancing
at
the
well
-
covered
board
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
,
"
replied
Kneebone
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
heard
of
your
escape
,
I
felt
sure
I
should
see
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
judged
rightly
,
"
rejoined
Jack
;
"
I
never
yet
broke
an
engagement
with
friend
or
foe
--
and
never
will
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
bold
resolution
,
"
said
the
woollen
-
draper
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
made
some
exertion
to
keep
your
present
appointment
.
<EOS>
Few
men
could
have
done
as
much
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
not
,
"
replied
Jack
,
carelessly
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
have
done
more
,
if
necessary
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
take
a
chair
,
"
rejoined
Kneebone
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
waited
supper
,
you
perceive
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
First
,
let
me
introduce
my
friends
,
"
returned
Jack
,
stepping
to
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
Friends
!
<EOS>
"
echoed
Kneebone
,
with
a
look
of
dismay
.
<EOS>
"
My
invitation
did
not
extend
to
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
Further
remonstrance
,
however
,
was
cut
short
by
the
sudden
entrance
of
Mrs.
Maggot
and
Edgeworth
Bess
.
<EOS>
Behind
them
stalked
Blueskin
,
enveloped
in
a
rough
great
-
coat
,
called
--
appropriately
enough
in
this
instance,--a
wrap
-
rascal
.
<EOS>
Folding
his
arms
,
he
placed
his
back
against
the
door
,
and
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
.
<EOS>
The
ladies
were
,
as
usual
,
very
gaily
dressed
;
and
as
usual
,
also
,
had
resorted
to
art
to
heighten
their
attractions--
     
From
patches
,
justly
placed
<EOS>
,
they
borrow'd
graces
,
    
<EOS>
And
with
vermilion
lacquer'd
<EOS>
o'er
their
faces
.
 
<EOS>
Edgeworth
Bess
wore
a
scarlet
tabby
<EOS>
negligée,--a
sort
of
undress
,
or
sack
,
then
much
in
vogue,--which
suited
her
to
admiration
,
and
upon
her
head
had
what
was
called
a
fly
-
cap
,
with
richly
-
laced
lappets
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Maggot
was
equipped
in
a
light
blue
riding
-
habit
,
trimmed
with
silver
,
a
hunting
-
cap
and
a
flaxen
peruke
,
and
,
instead
of
a
whip
,
carried
a
stout
cudgel
.
 
<EOS>
For
a
moment
,
Kneebone
had
hesitated
about
giving
the
signal
to
Shotbolt
,
but
,
thinking
a
more
favourable
opportunity
might
occur
,
he
determined
not
to
hazard
matters
by
undue
precipitation
.
<EOS>
Placing
chairs
,
therefore
,
he
invited
the
ladies
to
be
seated
,
and
,
paying
a
similar
attention
to
Jack
,
began
to
help
to
the
various
dishes
,
and
otherwise
fulfil
the
duties
of
a
host
.
<EOS>
While
this
was
going
on
,
Blueskin
,
seeing
no
notice
whatever
taken
of
him
,
coughed
loudly
and
repeatedly
.
<EOS>
But
finding
his
hints
totally
disregarded
,
he
,
at
length
,
swaggered
up
to
the
table
,
and
thrust
in
a
chair
.
 
<EOS>
"
Excuse
me
,
"
he
said
,
plunging
his
fork
into
a
fowl
,
and
transferring
it
to
his
plate
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
tongue
looks
remarkably
nice
,
"
he
added
,
slicing
off
an
immense
wedge
,
"
excuse
me
--
ho
!
<EOS>
ho
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
make
yourself
at
home
,
I
perceive
,
"
observed
Kneebone
,
with
a
look
of
ineffable
disgust
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
generally
do
,
"
replied
Blueskin
,
pouring
out
a
bumper
of
sack
.
"
<EOS>
Your
health
,
Kneebone
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Allow
me
to
offer
you
a
glass
of
usquebaugh
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Kneebone
,
turning
from
him
,
and
regarding
Edgeworth
Bess
with
a
stare
<EOS>
so
impertinent
,
that
even
that
not
over
-
delicate
young
lady
summoned
up
a
blush
.
 
<EOS>
"
With
pleasure
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Edgeworth
Bess
.
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
<EOS>
she
added
,
as
she
pledged
the
amorous
woollen
-
draper
,
"
what
a
beautiful
ring
that
is
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
so
?
"
<EOS>
replied
Kneebone
,
taking
it
off
,
and
placing
it
on
her
finger
,
which
he
took
the
opportunity
of
kissing
at
the
same
time
;
"
wear
it
for
my
sake
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear
!
<EOS>
"
simpered
Edgeworth
Bess
,
endeavouring
to
hide
her
confusion
by
looking
steadfastly
at
her
plate
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
eat
,
"
continued
Kneebone
,
addressing
Jack
,
who
had
remained
for
some
time
thoughtful
,
and
pre
-
occupied
with
his
head
upon
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
Captain
has
seldom
much
appetite
,
"
replied
Blueskin
,
who
,
having
disposed
of
the
fowl
,
was
commencing
a
vigorous
attack
upon
the
sirloin
.
<EOS>
"
I
eat
for
both
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
it
seems
,
"
observed
the
woollen
-
draper
,
"
and
for
every
one
else
,
too
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
Kneebone
,
"
rejoined
Blueskin
,
as
he
washed
down
an
immense
mouthful
with
another
bumper
,
"
do
you
recollect
<EOS>
how
nearly
Mr.
Wild
and
I
were
nabbing
you
in
this
very
room
,
some
nine
years
ago
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
replied
Kneebone
;
"
and
now
,
"
he
added
,
aside
,
"
the
case
is
altered
.
<EOS>
I
'm
nearly
nabbing
_
<EOS>
you
_
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
good
deal
has
occurred
since
then
,
eh
,
Captain
!
"
said
Blueskin
,
nudging
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
Much
that
I
would
willingly
forget
.
<EOS>
Nothing
that
I
desire
to
remember
,
"
replied
Sheppard
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
On
that
night,--in
this
<EOS>
room,--in
<EOS>
your
presence
,
Blueskin,--in
yours
Mr.
Kneebone
,
Mrs.
Wood
struck
me
a
blow
which
made
me
a
robber
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
has
paid
dearly
for
it
,
"
muttered
Blueskin
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
has
,
"
rejoined
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
wish
her
hand
had
been
as
deadly
as
yours
.
<EOS>
On
that
night,--that
fatal
night,--Winifred
crushed
all
the
hopes
that
were
rising
in
my
heart
.
<EOS>
On
that
night
,
I
surrendered
myself
to
Jonathan
Wild
,
and
became
--
what
I
am
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
On
that
night
,
you
first
met
me
,
love
,
"
said
Edgeworth
Bess
,
endeavouring
to
take
his
hand
,
which
he
coldly
withdrew
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
me
,
"
added
Mrs.
Maggot
tenderly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Would
I
had
never
seen
either
of
you
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jack
,
rising
and
pacing
the
apartment
with
a
hurried
step
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
'm
sure
Winifred
could
never
have
loved
you
as
well
as
I
do
,
"
said
Mrs.
Maggot
.
 
<EOS>
"
_
<EOS>
You
_
!
"
cried
Jack
,
scornfully
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
compare
_
your
_
love
--
a
love
which
all
may
purchase
--
with
_
hers
_
?
<EOS>
No
one
has
ever
loved
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Except
me
,
dear
,
"
insinuated
Edgeworth
Bess
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
been
always
true
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Peace
!
"
<EOS>
retorted
Jack
,
with
increased
bitterness
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
your
dupe
no
longer
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
the
devil
's
in
the
wind
now
,
Captain
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Blueskin
,
in
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
,
"
replied
Jack
,
with
forced
calmness
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Within
the
last
few
minutes
,
all
my
guilty
life
has
passed
before
me
.
<EOS>
Nine
years
ago
,
I
was
honest
--
was
happy
.
<EOS>
Nine
years
ago
,
I
worked
in
this
very
house
--
had
a
kind
indulgent
master
,
whom
I
robbed
--
twice
robbed
,
at
your
instigation
,
villain
;
a
mistress
,
whom
you
have
murdered
;
a
companion
,
whose
friendship
I
have
for
ever
forfeited
;
a
mother
,
whose
heart
I
have
well
-
nigh
broken
.
<EOS>
In
this
room
was
my
ruin
begun
:
in
this
room
it
should
be
ended
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
do
n't
take
on
thus
,
Captain
,
"
cried
Blueskin
,
rising
and
walking
towards
him
.
<EOS>
"
If
any
one
's
to
blame
,
it
's
me
.
<EOS>
I
'm
ready
to
bear
it
all
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Can
you
make
me
honest
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Can
you
make
me
other
than
a
condemned
felon
?
<EOS>
Can
you
make
me
not
Jack
Sheppard
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Blueskin
;
"
and
I
would
n't
if
I
could
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Curse
you
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jack
,
furiously,--"curse
<EOS>
you!--curse
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Swear
away
,
Captain
,
"
rejoined
Blueskin
,
coolly
.
<EOS>
"
It
'll
ease
your
mind
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mock
me
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Jack
,
levelling
a
pistol
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
I
,
"
replied
Blueskin
.
<EOS>
"
Take
my
life
,
if
you
're
so
disposed
.
<EOS>
You
're
welcome
to
it
.
<EOS>
And
let
's
see
if
either
of
these
women
,
who
prate
of
their
love
for
you
,
will
do
as
much
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
folly
,
"
cried
Jack
,
controlling
himself
by
a
powerful
effort
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
worst
of
folly
,
"
replied
Blueskin
,
returning
to
the
table
,
and
taking
up
a
glass
;
"
and
,
to
put
an
end
to
it
,
I
shall
drink
the
health
of
Jack
Sheppard
,
the
housebreaker
,
and
success
to
him
in
all
his
enterprises
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
let
's
see
who
'll
refuse
the
pledge
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
_
I
_
will
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Sheppard
,
dashing
the
glass
from
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
,
fool
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Jack
,
"
said
Kneebone
,
who
had
been
considerably
interested
by
the
foregoing
scene
,
"
are
these
regrets
for
your
past
life
sincere
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Suppose
them
so
,
"
rejoined
Jack
,
"
<EOS>
what
then
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
--
nothing
,
"
stammered
Kneebone
,
his
prudence
getting
the
better
of
his
sympathy
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
glad
to
hear
it
,
that
's
all
,
"
he
added
,
taking
out
his
snuff
-
box
,
his
never
-
failing
resource
in
such
emergencies
.
<EOS>
"
It
wo
n't
do
to
betray
the
officer
,
"
he
muttered
.
 
<EOS>
"
O
lud
!
<EOS>
what
an
exquisite
box
!
"
cried
Edgeworth
Bess
.
<EOS>
"
Is
it
gold
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pure
gold
,
"
replied
Kneebone
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
given
me
by
poor
dear
Mrs.
Wood
,
whose
loss
I
shall
ever
deplore
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
let
me
have
a
pinch
!
"
said
Edgeworth
Bess
,
with
a
captivating
glance
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
excessively
fond
of
snuff
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
woollen
-
draper
replied
by
gallantly
handing
her
the
box
,
which
was
instantly
snatched
from
her
by
Blueskin
,
who
,
after
helping
himself
to
as
much
of
its
contents
as
he
could
conveniently
squeeze
between
his
thumb
and
finger
,
put
it
very
coolly
in
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
The
action
did
not
pass
unnoticed
by
Sheppard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Restore
it
,
"
he
cried
,
in
an
authoritative
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
O'ons
!
<EOS>
Captain
,
"
cried
Blueskin
,
as
he
grumblingly
obeyed
the
command
;
"
if
you
've
left
off
business
yourself
,
you
need
n't
interfere
with
other
people
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
a
little
of
that
plum
-
tart
,
"
said
Mrs.
Maggot
;
"
but
I
do
n't
see
a
spoon
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
ring
for
one
,
"
replied
Kneebone
,
rising
accordingly
;
"
but
I
fear
my
servants
are
gone
to
bed
.
"
 
<EOS>
Blueskin
,
meanwhile
,
having
drained
and
replenished
his
glass
,
commenced
chaunting
a
snatch
of
a
ballad:--
     
Once
on
a
time
,
as
I
've
heard
tell
.
    
<EOS>
In
Wych
Street
Owen
Wood
did
dwell
;
    
<EOS>
A
carpenter
he
was
by
trade
,
    
And
money
,
I
believe
,
he
made
.
        
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
With
his
foodle
doo
_
!
     
<EOS>
This
carpenter
he
had
a
wife
,
    
The
plague
and
torment
of
his
life
,
    
<EOS>
Who
,
though
she
did
her
husband
scold
,
    
Loved
well
a
woollen
-
draper
bold
.
        
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
With
her
foodle
doo
_
!
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
a
toast
to
propose
,
"
cried
Sheppard
,
filling
a
bumper
.
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
refuse
it
,
Mr.
Kneebone
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
'd
better
not
,
"
muttered
Blueskin
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
woollen
-
draper
,
as
he
returned
to
the
table
,
and
took
up
a
glass
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
speedy
union
of
Thames
Darrell
with
Winifred
Wood
,
"
replied
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
Kneebone
's
cheeks
glowed
with
rage
,
and
he
set
down
the
wine
untasted
,
while
Blueskin
resumed
his
song
.
     
<EOS>
Now
Owen
Wood
had
one
fair
child
,
    
<EOS>
Unlike
her
mother
,
meek
and
mild
;
    
Her
love
the
draper
strove
to
gain
,
    
<EOS>
But
she
repaid
him
with
disdain
.
        
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
With
his
foodle
doo
_
!
 
<EOS>
"
Peace
!
"
cried
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
But
Blueskin
was
not
to
be
silenced
.
<EOS>
He
continued
his
ditty
,
in
spite
of
the
angry
glances
of
his
leader
.
     
<EOS>
In
vain
he
fondly
urged
his
suit
,
    
<EOS>
And
,
all
in
vain
,
the
question
put
;
    
She
<EOS>
answered,--"Mr
.
<EOS>
William
Kneebone
,
    
Of
me
,
Sir
,
you
shall
never
be
bone
.
"
        
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
With
your
foodle
doo
_
!
     
<EOS>
"
Thames
Darrell
has
my
heart
alone
,
    
A
noble
youth
,
e'en
<EOS>
_
you
_
must
own
;
    
<EOS>
And
,
if
from
him
my
love
could
stir
,
    
Jack
Sheppard
I
should
much
prefer
!
"
        
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
With
his
foodle
doo
_
!
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
refuse
my
toast
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Jack
,
impatiently
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
replied
Kneebone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Drink
this
,
then
,
"
roared
Blueskin
.
<EOS>
And
pouring
the
contents
of
a
small
powder
-
flask
into
a
bumper
of
brandy
,
he
tendered
him
the
mixture
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
the
door
was
opened
by
Rachel
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
ring
for
,
Sir
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
,
eyeing
the
group
with
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
master
wants
a
few
table
-
spoons
,
child
,
"
said
Mrs.
Maggot
.
 
<EOS>
"
Leave
the
room
,
"
interposed
Kneebone
,
angrily
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
sha
n't
,
"
replied
Rachel
,
saucily
.
<EOS>
"
I
came
to
see
Jack
Sheppard
,
and
I
wo
n't
go
till
you
point
him
out
to
me
.
<EOS>
You
told
me
he
was
going
back
to
Newgate
after
supper
,
so
I
may
n't
have
another
opportunity
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
he
told
you
that
,
did
he
?
"
<EOS>
said
Blueskin
,
marching
up
to
her
,
and
chucking
her
under
the
chin
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
show
you
Captain
Sheppard
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
There
he
stands
.
<EOS>
I
'm
his
lieutenant,--Lieutenant
Blueskin
.
<EOS>
We
're
two
good
-
looking
fellows
,
ai
n't
we
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Very
good
-
looking
,
"
replied
Rachel
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
where
's
the
strange
gentleman
I
saw
under
the
table
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Under
the
table
!
"
echoed
Blueskin
,
winking
at
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
When
did
you
see
him
,
my
love
?
"
 
"
A
short
time
ago
,
"
replied
the
housekeeper
,
unsuspiciously
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
plot
's
out
!
"
cried
Jack
.
<EOS>
And
,
without
another
word
,
he
seized
the
table
with
both
hands
,
and
upset
it
;
scattering
plates
,
dishes
,
bottles
,
jugs
,
and
glasses
far
and
wide
.
<EOS>
The
crash
was
tremendous
.
<EOS>
The
lights
rolled
over
,
and
were
extinguished
.
<EOS>
And
,
if
Rachel
had
not
carried
a
candle
,
the
room
would
have
been
plunged
in
total
darkness
.
<EOS>
Amid
the
confusion
,
Shotbolt
sprang
to
his
feet
,
and
levelling
a
pistol
at
Jack
's
head
,
commanded
him
to
surrender
;
but
,
before
any
reply
could
be
made
,
the
jailer
's
arm
was
struck
up
by
Blueskin
,
who
,
throwing
himself
upon
him
,
dragged
him
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
In
the
struggle
the
pistol
went
off
,
but
without
damage
to
either
party
.
<EOS>
The
conflict
was
of
short
duration
;
for
Shotbolt
was
no
match
for
his
athletic
antagonist
.
<EOS>
He
was
speedily
disarmed
;
and
the
rope
and
gag
being
found
upon
him
,
were
exultingly
turned
against
him
by
his
conqueror
,
who
,
after
pinioning
his
arms
tightly
behind
his
back
,
forced
open
his
mouth
with
the
iron
,
and
effectually
prevented
the
utterance
of
any
further
outcries
.
<EOS>
While
the
strife
was
raging
,
Edgeworth
Bess
walked
up
to
Rachel
,
and
advised
her
,
if
she
valued
her
life
,
not
to
scream
or
stir
from
the
spot
;
a
caution
which
the
housekeeper
,
whose
curiosity
far
outweighed
her
fears
,
received
in
very
good
part
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
interim
,
Jack
advanced
to
the
woollen
-
draper
,
and
regarding
him
sternly
,
thus
addressed
him
:
 
"
You
have
violated
the
laws
of
hospitality
,
Mr.
Kneebone
,
I
came
hither
as
your
guest
.
<EOS>
You
have
betrayed
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
faith
is
to
be
kept
with
a
felon
?
<EOS>
"
replied
the
woollen
-
draper
,
disdainfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
who
breaks
faith
with
his
benefactor
may
well
justify
himself
thus
,
"
answered
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
trusted
you
.
<EOS>
Others
who
have
done
,
have
found
you
false
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
understand
you
,
"
replied
Kneebone
,
in
some
confusion
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
soon
shall
,
"
rejoined
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
Where
are
the
packets
committed
to
your
charge
by
Sir
Rowland
Trenchard
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
packets
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Kneebone
,
in
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
useless
to
deny
it
,
"
replied
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
You
were
watched
to
-
night
by
Blueskin
.
<EOS>
You
met
Sir
Rowland
at
the
house
of
a
Romisch
priest
,
Father
Spencer
.
<EOS>
Two
packets
were
committed
to
your
charge
,
which
you
undertook
to
deliver,--one
to
another
priest
,
Sir
Rowland
's
chaplain
,
at
Manchester
,
the
other
to
Mr.
Wood
.
<EOS>
Produce
them
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
!
"
replied
Kneebone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
,
by
Heaven
!
<EOS>
you
are
a
dead
man
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Jack
,
cocking
a
pistol
,
and
pointing
it
deliberately
at
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
I
give
you
one
minute
for
reflection
.
<EOS>
After
that
time
nothing
shall
save
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
brief
,
breathless
pause
.
<EOS>
Even
Blueskin
looked
on
with
anxiety
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
past
,
"
said
Jack
,
placing
his
finger
on
the
trigger
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hold
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Kneebone
,
flinging
down
the
packets
<EOS>
;
"
they
are
nothing
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
they
are
everything
to
me
,
"
cried
Jack
,
stooping
to
pick
them
up
.
<EOS>
"
These
packets
will
establish
Thames
Darrell
's
birth
,
win
him
his
inheritance
,
and
procure
him
the
hand
of
Winifred
Wood
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
too
sure
of
that
,
"
rejoined
Kneebone
,
snatching
up
the
staff
,
and
aiming
a
blow
at
his
head
,
which
was
fortunately
warded
off
by
Mrs.
Maggot
,
who
promptly
interposed
her
cudgel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Defend
yourself
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jack
,
drawing
his
sword
.
 
<EOS>
"
Leave
his
punishment
to
me
,
Jack
,
"
said
Mrs.
Maggot
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
the
Bridewell
account
to
settle
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Be
it
so
,
"
replied
Jack
,
putting
up
his
blade
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
a
good
deal
to
do
.
<EOS>
Show
him
no
quarter
,
Poll
.
<EOS>
He
deserves
none
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
shall
find
none
,
"
replied
the
Amazon
.
"
<EOS>
Now
,
Mr.
Kneebone
,
"
she
added
,
drawing
up
her
magnificent
figure
to
its
full
height
,
and
making
the
heavy
cudgel
whistle
through
the
air
,
"
look
to
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Stand
off
,
Poll
,
"
rejoined
the
woollen
-
draper
;
"
I
do
n't
want
to
hurt
you
.
<EOS>
It
shall
never
be
said
that
I
raised
my
arm
willingly
against
a
woman
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
forgive
you
all
the
harm
you
do
me
,
"
rejoined
the
Amazon
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
you
still
hesitate
!
<EOS>
Will
that
rouse
you
,
coward
?
"
<EOS>
And
she
gave
him
a
smart
rap
on
the
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
Coward
!
"
cried
Kneebone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Neither
man
nor
woman
shall
apply
that
term
to
me
.
<EOS>
If
you
forget
your
sex
,
jade
,
I
must
forget
mine
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
he
attacked
her
vigorously
in
his
turn
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
curious
sight
to
see
how
this
extraordinary
woman
,
who
,
it
has
been
said
,
was
not
less
remarkable
for
the
extreme
delicacy
of
her
features
,
and
the
faultless
symmetry
of
her
figure
,
than
for
her
wonderful
strength
and
agility
,
conducted
herself
in
the
present
encounter
;
with
what
dexterity
she
parried
every
blow
aimed
against
her
by
her
adversary
,
whose
head
and
face
,
already
marked
by
various
ruddy
streams
<EOS>
,
showed
how
successfully
her
own
hits
had
been
made;--how
<EOS>
she
drew
him
hither
and
thither
,
now
leading
him
on
,
now
driving
him
suddenly
back
;
harassing
and
exhausting
him
in
every
possible
way
,
and
making
it
apparent
that
she
could
at
any
moment
put
an
end
to
the
fight
,
and
only
delayed
the
finishing
stroke
to
make
his
punishment
the
more
severe
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
,
meanwhile
,
with
Blueskin
's
assistance
,
had
set
the
table
once
more
upon
its
legs
,
and
placing
writing
materials
,
which
he
took
from
a
shelf
,
upon
it
,
made
Shotbolt
,
who
was
still
gagged
,
but
whose
arms
were
for
the
moment
unbound
,
sit
down
before
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
Write
as
I
dictate
,
"
he
cried
,
placing
a
pen
in
the
jailer
's
hand
and
a
pistol
to
his
ear
.
 
<EOS>
Shotbolt
nodded
in
token
of
acquiescence
,
and
emitted
an
odd
guttural
sound
.
 
<EOS>
"
Write
as
follows
,
"
continued
Jack
.
"
<EOS>
'
I
have
succeeded
in
capturing
Jack
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
The
reward
is
mine
.
<EOS>
Get
all
ready
for
his
reception
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
after
the
delivery
of
this
note
he
will
be
in
Newgate
.
'
<EOS>
Sign
it
,
"
he
added
,
as
,
after
some
further
threats
,
the
letter
was
indited
according
to
his
dictation
,
"
and
direct
it
to
Mr.
Austin
.
<EOS>
That
's
well
.
<EOS>
And
,
now
,
to
find
a
messenger
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Kneebone
's
man
is
in
the
shop
,
"
said
Rachel
;
"
he
'll
take
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Can
I
trust
him
?
"
<EOS>
mused
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
he
'll
suspect
nothing
.
<EOS>
Give
him
this
letter
,
child
,
and
bid
him
take
it
to
the
Lodge
at
Newgate
without
loss
of
time
.
<EOS>
Blueskin
will
go
with
you,--for
fear
of
a
mistake
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
might
trust
me
,
"
said
Rachel
,
in
an
offended
tone
;
"
but
never
mind
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
she
left
the
room
with
Blueskin
,
who
very
politely
offered
her
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
combat
between
Kneebone
and
Mrs.
Maggot
had
been
brought
to
a
termination
.
<EOS>
When
the
woollen
-
draper
was
nearly
worn
out
,
the
Amazon
watched
her
opportunity
,
and
hitting
him
on
the
arm
,
disabled
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
for
Mrs.
Wood
,
"
she
cried
,
as
the
staff
fell
from
his
grasp
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
at
your
mercy
,
Poll
,
"
rejoined
Kneebone
,
abjectly
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
for
Winifred
,
"
vociferated
the
Amazon
,
bringing
the
cudgel
heavily
upon
his
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
"
Damnation
!
"
cried
Kneebone
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
for
myself
,
"
rejoined
Mrs.
Maggot
,
dealing
him
a
blow
,
which
stretched
him
senseless
on
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bravo
,
Poll
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jack
,
who
having
again
pinioned
Shotbolt
,
was
now
tracing
a
few
hasty
lines
on
a
sheet
of
paper
.
<EOS>
"
You
've
given
him
a
broken
head
,
I
perceive
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
'll
scarcely
need
a
plaister
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Maggot
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
,
Bess
,
give
me
the
cord
,
and
I
'll
tie
him
to
this
chest
of
drawers
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
he
'll
come
to
himself
too
soon
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
best
to
be
on
the
safe
side
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Decidedly
so
,
"
replied
Edgeworth
Bess
;
"
and
I
'll
take
this
opportunity
,
while
Jack
's
back
is
turned,--for
he
's
grown
so
strangely
<EOS>
particular,--of
easing
him
of
his
snuff
-
box
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
"
she
added
,
in
a
whisper
,
as
she
appropriated
the
before
-
named
article
,
"
he
has
a
pocket
-
book
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
replied
Mrs.
Maggot
;
"
Jack
will
hear
you
.
<EOS>
We
'll
come
back
for
that
by
and
by
,
and
the
dressing
-
gown
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
Rachel
and
Blueskin
returned
.
<EOS>
Their
momentary
absence
seemed
to
have
worked
wonders
;
for
now
the
most
perfect
understanding
appeared
to
subsist
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
sent
off
the
note
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
,
Captain
,
"
replied
Blueskin
.
<EOS>
"
I
say
_
we
_
,
because
Miss
Rachel
and
I
have
struck
up
a
match
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
bring
off
anything
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
looking
eagerly
round
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Jack
,
peremptorily
.
 
<EOS>
Having
now
sealed
his
letter
,
Sheppard
took
a
handkerchief
,
and
tying
it
over
Shotbolt
's
face
,
so
as
completely
to
conceal
the
features
,
clapped
his
hat
upon
his
head
,
and
pushed
it
over
his
brows
.
<EOS>
He
,
next
,
seized
the
unlucky
jailer
,
and
forced
him
along
,
while
Blueskin
expedited
his
movements
by
administering
a
few
kicks
behind
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
got
to
the
door
,
Jack
opened
it
,
and
,
mimicking
the
voice
of
the
jailer
,
shouted
,
"
Now
,
my
lads
,
all
's
ready
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Here
we
are
,
"
cried
the
chairmen
,
hurrying
out
of
the
court
with
their
swinging
vehicle
,
"
where
is
he
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Here
,
"
replied
Sheppard
,
dragging
out
Shotbolt
by
the
collar
,
while
Blueskin
pushed
him
behind
,
and
Mrs.
Maggot
held
up
a
lantern
,
which
she
found
in
the
shop
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
with
him
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
--
ay
,
yer
hon'r
,
"
cried
the
foremost
chairman
,
lending
a
helping
hand
.
<EOS>
"
Get
in
wid
ye
,
ye
villin
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
despite
his
resistance
,
Shotbolt
was
thrust
into
the
chair
,
which
was
instantly
fastened
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
,
he
's
as
safe
as
Jack
Sheppard
in
the
Condemned
Hould
,
"
laughed
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Off
with
you
to
Newgate
!
"
cried
Jack
,
"
and
do
n't
let
him
out
till
you
get
inside
the
Lodge
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
letter
for
the
head
turnkey
,
Mr.
Irreton
.
<EOS>
D'ye
hear
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yer
hon'r
,
"
replied
the
chairman
,
taking
the
note
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
waiting
for
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Jack
,
impatiently
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
gen'l'man
as
hired
us
,
"
replied
the
chairman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
he
'll
be
after
you
directly
.
<EOS>
He
's
settling
an
account
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
Lose
no
time
.
<EOS>
The
letter
will
explain
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
chair
was
then
rapidly
put
in
motion
,
and
speedily
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
to
be
done
next
?
"
cried
Blueskin
,
returning
to
Rachel
,
who
was
standing
with
Edgeworth
Bess
near
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
go
back
and
finish
my
supper
,
"
said
Mrs.
Maggot
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
shall
I
,
"
replied
Edgeworth
Bess
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stop
a
minute
,
"
cried
Jack
,
detaining
his
mistresses
.
"
<EOS>
Here
we
part,--perhaps
for
ever
.
<EOS>
I
've
already
told
you
I
'm
about
to
take
a
long
journey
,
and
it
's
more
than
probable
<EOS>
I
shall
never
return
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Do
n't
say
so
,
"
cried
Mrs.
Maggot
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
perfectly
miserable
if
_
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
_
thought
you
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
very
idea
is
dreadful
,
"
whimpered
Edgeworth
Bess
.
 
<EOS>
"
Farewell
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jack
,
embracing
them
.
<EOS>
"
Take
this
key
to
Baptist
Kettleby
.
<EOS>
On
seeing
it
,
he
'll
deliver
you
a
box
,
which
it
will
unlock
,
and
in
which
you
'll
find
a
matter
of
fifty
guineas
and
a
few
trinkets
.
<EOS>
Divide
the
money
between
you
,
and
wear
the
ornaments
for
my
sake
.
<EOS>
But
,
if
you
've
a
spark
of
love
for
me
,
do
n't
meddle
with
anything
in
that
house
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
for
worlds
!
"
exclaimed
both
ladies
together
.
 
<EOS>
"
Farewell
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jack
,
breaking
from
them
,
and
rushing
down
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
shall
we
do
,
Poll
?
"
hesitated
Edgeworth
Bess
.
 
<EOS>
"
Go
in
,
to
be
sure
,
simpleton
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Maggot
,
"
and
bring
off
all
we
can
.
<EOS>
I
know
where
everything
valuable
is
kept
.
<EOS>
Since
Jack
has
left
us
,
what
does
it
matter
whether
he
's
pleased
or
not
?
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
a
whistle
was
heard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Coming
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Blueskin
,
who
was
still
lingering
with
Rachel
.
"
<EOS>
The
Captain
's
in
such
a
desperate
hurry
,
that
there
's
no
time
for
love
-
making
.
<EOS>
Adieu
!
<EOS>
my
charmer
.
<EOS>
You
'll
find
those
young
ladies
extremely
agreeable
acquaintances
.
<EOS>
Adieu
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
snatching
a
hasty
kiss
,
he
darted
after
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
The
chair
,
meanwhile
,
with
its
unhappy
load
,
was
transported
at
a
brisk
pace
to
Newgate
.
<EOS>
Arrived
there
,
the
porter
thundered
at
the
massive
door
of
the
Lodge
,
which
was
instantly
opened
--
Shotbolt
's
note
having
been
received
just
before
.
<EOS>
All
the
turnkeys
were
assembled
.
<EOS>
Ireton
and
Langley
had
returned
from
a
second
unsuccessful
search
;
Marvel
had
come
thither
to
bid
good
-
night
to
Mrs.
Spurling
;
Austin
had
never
quitted
his
post
.
<EOS>
The
tapstress
was
full
of
curiosity
;
but
she
appeared
more
easy
than
the
others
.
<EOS>
Behind
her
stood
Caliban
,
chuckling
to
himself
,
and
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
who
'd
have
thought
of
Shotbolt
beating
us
all
in
this
way
!
"
said
Ireton
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sorry
for
old
Newgate
that
another
jail
should
have
it
.
<EOS>
It
's
infernally
provoking
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Infernally
provoking
!
"
echoed
Langley
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nobody
has
so
much
cause
for
complaint
as
me
,
"
growled
Austin
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
lost
my
wager
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Twenty
pounds
,
"
rejoined
Mrs.
Spurling
.
<EOS>
"
I
witnessed
the
bet
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Here
he
is
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Ireton
,
as
the
knocking
was
heard
without
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Get
ready
the
irons
,
Caliban
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Wait
a
bit
,
massa
,
"
replied
the
grinning
negro,--"lilly
bit
--
see
all
right
fust
.
"
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
the
chair
had
been
brought
into
the
Lodge
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
've
got
him
?
"
demanded
Ireton
.
 
<EOS>
"
Safe
inside
,
"
replied
the
chairman
,
wiping
the
heat
from
his
brow
;
"
we
've
run
all
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Where
's
Mr.
Shotbolt
?
"
asked
Austin
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
gen'l'man'll
be
here
directly
.
<EOS>
He
was
detained
.
<EOS>
T
'
other
gen'l'man
said
the
letter
'
ud
explain
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Detained
!
"
echoed
Marvel
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
odd
.
<EOS>
But
,
let
's
see
the
prisoner
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
chair
was
then
opened
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shotbolt
!
by--
"
cried
Austin
,
as
the
captive
was
dragged
forth
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
won
,
after
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
Exclamations
of
wonder
burst
from
all
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Spurling
bit
her
lips
to
conceal
her
mirth
.
<EOS>
Caliban
absolutely
crowed
with
delight
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hear
the
letter
,
"
said
Ireton
,
breaking
the
seal
.
"
<EOS>
'
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
This
is
the
way
in
which
I
will
serve
all
who
attempt
to
apprehend
me
_
.
'
<EOS>
It
is
signed
JACK
SHEPPARD
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
,
so
Jack
Sheppard
has
sent
back
Shotbolt
in
this
pickle
,
"
said
Langley
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
it

Marvel

<EOS>
"
Untie
his
arms
,
and
take
off
that
handkerchief

<EOS>
The
poor
fellow
's
half
smothered
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
guess
what
share
you
've
had
in
this

"
whispered
Austin
to
Mrs.
Spurling
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
,
"
replied
the
tapstress
.
<EOS>
"
You
've
won
your
wager
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
after
this
occurrence
,
when
it
had
been
sufficiently
laughed
at
and
discussed
;
when
the
wager
had
been
settled
,
and
the
chairman
dismissed
with
the
remaining
three
guineas
,
which
Shotbolt
was
compelled
to
pay
;
Ireton
arose
,
and
signified
his
intention
of
stepping
across
the
street
to
inform
Mr.
Wild
of
the
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
it
's
getting
late
,
and
the
porter
may
be
gone
to
bed
,
"
he
observed
;
"
I
'll
take
the
pass
-
key
,
and
let
myself
in
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wild
is
sure
to
be
up
.
<EOS>
He
never
retires
to
rest
till
daybreak
--
if
at
all

<EOS>
Come
with

,
Langley
,

bring
the

CHAPTER
XIV
.
 
<EOS>
How
Jack
Sheppard
was
again
captured
.
  
<EOS>
Jack
Sheppard
,
after
whistling
to
Blueskin
,
hurried
down
a
short
thoroughfare
leading
from
Wych
Street
to
the
back
of
Saint
Clement
's
Church
,
where
he
found
Thames
Darrell
,
who
advanced
to
meet
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
just
going
,
"
said
Thames
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
parted
from
you
at
Mr.
Kneebone
's
door
,
you
begged
me
to
await
your
return
here
,
assuring
me
you
would
not
detain
me
five
minutes
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
which
,
more
than
half
an
hour
has
elapsed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
complain
of
the
delay
when
I
tell
you
what
I
've
done
,
"
answered
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
obtained
two
packets
,
containing
letters
from
Sir
Rowland
Trenchard
,
which
I
've
no
doubt
will
establish
your
title
to
the
estates
.
<EOS>
Take
them
,
and
may
they
prove
as
serviceable
to
you
as
I
desire
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Jack
,
"
replied
Thames
,
greatly
moved
,
"
I
wish
I
could
devise
any
means
of
brightening
your
own
dark
prospects
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
impossible
,
"
replied
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
utterly
lost
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
utterly
,
"
rejoined
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
Utterly
,
"
reiterated
Jack
,
gloomily,--"as
regards
all
I
hold
dear
.
<EOS>
Listen
to
me
,
Thames
.
<EOS>
I
'm
about
to
leave
this
country
for
ever
.
<EOS>
Having
ascertained
that
a
vessel
sails
for
France
from
the
river
at
daybreak
to
-
morrow
morning
,
I
have
secured
a
passage
in
her
,
and
have
already
had
the
few
effects
I
possess
,
conveyed
on
board
.
<EOS>
Blueskin
goes
with
me
.
<EOS>
The
faithful
fellow
will
never
leave
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
,
while
I
've
breath
in
my
body
,
Captain
,
"
rejoined
Blueskin
,
who
had
joined
them
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
England
or
France
,
London
or
Paris
,
it
's
all
one
to
me
,
so
I
've
you
to
command
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Stand
out
of
earshot
,
"
rejoined
his
leader
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
call
you
when
you
're
wanted
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
Blueskin
withdrew
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
but
approve
the
course
you
are
about
to
take
,
Jack
,
"
said
Thames
,
"
though
on
some
accounts
I
regret
it
.
<EOS>
In
after
years
you
can
return
to
your
own
country
--
to
your
friends
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
,
"
replied
Sheppard
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"
My
friends
need
not
fear
my
return
.
<EOS>
They
shall
hear
of
me
no
more
.
<EOS>
Under
another
name,--not
my
own
hateful
one,--I
will
strive
to
distinguish
myself
in
some
foreign
service
,
and
win
myself
a
reputation
,
or
perish
honourably
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
never
--
never
return
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
attempt
to
combat
your
resolution
,
Jack
,
"
returned
Thames
,
after
a
pause
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
dread
the
effect
your
departure
may
have
upon
your
poor
mother
.
<EOS>
Her
life
hangs
upon
a
thread
,
and
this
may
snap
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
had
n't
mentioned
her
,
"
said
Jack
,
in
a
broken
voice
,
while
his
whole
frame
shook
with
emotion
.
<EOS>
"
What
I
do
is
for
the
best
,
and
I
can
only
hope
she
may
have
strength
to
bear
the
separation
.
<EOS>
You
must
say
farewell
to
her
,
for
I
can
not
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
ask
you
to
supply
my
place
--
for
that
is
,
perhaps
,
impossible
.
<EOS>
But
,
be
like
a
son
to
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
doubt
me
,
"
replied
Thames
,
warmly
pressing
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
I
've
one
further
request
,
"
faltered
Jack
;
"
though
I
scarcely
know
how
to
make
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
to
set
me
right
with
Winifred
.
<EOS>
Do
not
let
her
think
worse
of
me
than
I
deserve,--or
even
so
ill
.
<EOS>
Tell
her
,
that
more
than
once
,
when
about
to
commit
some
desperate
offence
,
I
have
been
restrained
by
her
gentle
image
.
<EOS>
If
hopeless
love
for
her
made
me
a
robber
,
it
has
also
saved
me
many
a
crime
.
<EOS>
Will
you
tell
her
that
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
"
replied
Thames
,
earnestly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Enough
,
"
said
Jack
,
recovering
his
composure
.
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
to
your
own
concerns
.
<EOS>
Blueskin
,
who
has
been
on
the
watch
all
night
,
has
dogged
Sir
Rowland
Trenchard
to
Jonathan
Wild
's
house
;
and
,
from
the
mysterious
manner
in
which
he
was
admitted
by
the
thief
-
taker
's
confidential
servant
,
Abraham
Mendez
,
and
not
by
the
regular
porter
,
there
is
little
doubt
but
they
are
alone
,
and
probably
making
some
arrangements
prior
to
our
uncle
's
departure
from
England
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Is
he
leaving
England
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Thames
,
in
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
sails
to
-
morrow
morning
in
the
very
vessel
by
which
I
start
,
"
replied
Jack
.
"
<EOS>
Now
,
if
as
I
suspect,--from
the
documents
just
placed
in
your
possession,--Sir
<EOS>
Rowland
meditates
doing
you
justice
after
his
departure
<EOS>
,
it
is
possible
his
intentions
may
be
frustrated
by
the
machinations
of
Wild
,
whose
interest
is
obviously
to
prevent
such
an
occurrence
,
unless
we
can
surprise
them
together
,
and
,
by
proving
to
Sir
Rowland
that
we
possess
the
power
of
compelling
a
restitution
of
your
rights
,
force
the
other
treacherous
villain
into
compliance
.
<EOS>
Jonathan
,
in
all
probability
,
knows
nothing
of
these
packets
;
and
their
production
may
serve
to
intimidate
him
.
<EOS>
Will
you
venture
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
hazardous
experiment
,
"
said
Thames
,
after
a
moment
's
reflection
;
"
but
I
will
make
it
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
,
however
,
accompany
me
,
Jack
.
<EOS>
The
risk
I
run
is
nothing
to
yours
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
care
for
no
risk
,
provided
I
can
serve
you
,
"
rejoined
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
Besides
,
you
'll
not
be
able
to
get
in
without
me
.
<EOS>
It
wo
n't
do
to
knock
at
the
door
,
and
Jonathan
Wild
's
house
is
not
quite
so
easy
of
entrance
as
Mr.
Wood
's
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
understand
,
"
replied
Thames
<EOS>
;
"
be
it
as
you
will
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
,
we
'll
lose
no
more
time
,
"
returned
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
Come
along
,
Blueskin
.
"
 
<EOS>
Starting
at
a
rapid
pace
in
the
direction
of
the
Old
Bailey
,
and
crossing
Fleet
Bridge
,
"
for
oyster
tubs
renowned
,
"
the
trio
skirted
the
right
bank
of
the
muddy
stream
until
they
reached
Fleet
Lane
,
up
which
they
hurried
.
<EOS>
Turning
off
again
on
the
left
,
down
Seacoal
Lane
,
they
arrived
at
the
mouth
of
a
dark
,
narrow
alley
,
into
which
they
plunged
;
and
,
at
the
farther
extremity
found
a
small
yard
,
overlooked
by
the
blank
walls
of
a
large
gloomy
habitation
.
<EOS>
A
door
in
this
house
opened
upon
the
yard
.
<EOS>
Jack
tried
it
,
and
found
it
locked
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
my
old
tools
with
me
,
we
'd
soon
master
this
obstacle
,
"
he
muttered
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
be
obliged
to
force
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Try
the
cellar
,
Captain
,
"
said
Blueskin
,
stamping
upon
a
large
board
in
the
ground
.
<EOS>
"
Here
's
the
door
.
<EOS>
This
is
the
way
the
old
thief
brings
in
all
his
heavy
plunder
,
which
he
stows
in
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
holes
in
his
infernal
dwelling
.
<EOS>
I
've
seen
him
often
do
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
While
making
these
remarks
,
Blueskin
contrived
,
by
means
of
a
chisel
which
he
chanced
to
have
about
him
,
to
lift
up
the
board
,
and
,
introducing
his
fingers
beneath
it
,
with
Jack
's
assistance
speedily
opened
it
altogether
,
disclosing
a
dark
hole
,
into
which
he
leapt
.
 
<EOS>
"
Follow
me
,
Thames
,
"
cried
Jack
,
dropping
into
the
chasm
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
now
in
a
sort
of
cellar
,
at
one
end
of
which
was
a
door
.
<EOS>
It
was
fastened
inside
.
<EOS>
But
,
taking
the
chisel
from
Blueskin
,
Jack
quickly
forced
back
the
bolt
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
entered
the
room
beyond
,
a
fierce
growl
was
heard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
go
first
,
"
said
Blueskin
;
"
the
dogs
know
me
.
<EOS>
Soho
!
<EOS>
boys
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
walking
up
to
the
animals
,
which
were
chained
to
the
wall
,
they
instantly
recognised
him
,
and
suffered
the
others
to
pass
without
barking
.
 
<EOS>
Groping
their
way
through
one
or
two
dark
and
mouldy
-
smelling
vaults
,
the
party
ascended
a
flight
of
steps
,
which
brought
them
to
the
hall
.
<EOS>
As
Jack
conjectured
,
no
one
was
there
,
and
,
though
a
lamp
was
burning
on
a
stand
,
they
decided
upon
proceeding
without
it
.
<EOS>
They
then
swiftly
mounted
the
stairs
,
and
stopped
before
the
audience
-
chamber
.
<EOS>
Applying
his
ear
to
the
keyhole
,
Jack
listened
,
but
could
detect
no
sound
.
<EOS>
He
,
next
cautiously
tried
the
door
,
but
found
it
fastened
inside
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
fear
we
're
too
late
,
"
he
whispered
to
Thames
.
<EOS>
"
But
,
we
'll
soon
see
.
<EOS>
Give
me
the
chisel
,
Blueskin
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
dexterously
applying
the
implement
,
he
forced
open
the
lock
.
 
<EOS>
They
then
entered
the
room
,
which
was
perfectly
dark
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
strange
,
"
said
Jack
,
under
his
breath
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Sir
Rowland
must
be
gone
.
<EOS>
And
,
yet
,
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
The
key
's
in
the
lock
,
on
the
inner
side
.
<EOS>
Be
on
your
guard
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
,
"
replied
Thames
,
who
had
followed
him
closely
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
fetch
the
light
,
Captain
?
"
whispered
Blueskin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
replied
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
how
it
is
,
"
he
added
in
a
low
voice
to
Thames
,
as
they
were
left
alone
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
've
a
strange
foreboding
of
ill
.
<EOS>
My
heart
fails
me
.
<EOS>
I
almost
wish
we
had
n't
come
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
said
this
,
he
moved
forward
a
few
paces
,
when
,
finding
his
feet
glued
to
the
ground
by
some
adhesive
substance
,
he
stooped
to
feel
what
it
was
,
but
instantly
withdrew
his
hand
,
with
an
exclamation
of
horror
.
 
<EOS>
"
God
in
Heaven
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
"
the
floor
is
covered
with
blood
.
<EOS>
Some
foul
murder
has
been
committed
.
<EOS>
The
light!--the
light
!
"
 
<EOS>
Astounded
at
his
cries
,
Thames
sprang
towards
him
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
Blueskin
appeared
with
the
lamp
,
and
revealed
a
horrible
spectacle,--the
floor
deluged
with
blood,--various
articles
of
furniture
upset,--papers
scattered
about,--the
murdered
man
's
cloak
,
trampled
upon
,
and
smeared
with
gore,--his
hat
,
crushed
and
similarly
stained,--his
<EOS>
sword,--the
ensanguined
cloth,--with
<EOS>
several
other
ghastly
evidences
of
the
slaughterous
deed
.
<EOS>
Further
on
,
there
were
impressions
of
bloody
footsteps
along
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
Rowland
is
murdered
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jack
,
as
soon
as
he
could
find
a
tongue
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
plain
he
has
been
destroyed
by
his
perfidious
accomplice
,
"
rejoined
Thames
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
God
!
<EOS>
how
fearfully
my
father
is
avenged
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
True
,
"
replied
Jack
,
sternly
;
"
but
we
have
our
uncle
to
avenge
.
<EOS>
What
's
this
?
<EOS>
"
he
added
,
stooping
to
pick
up
a
piece
of
paper
lying
at
his
feet
--
it
was
Jonathan
's
memorandum
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
explanation
of
the
bloody
deed
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Here
's
a
pocket
-
book
full
of
notes
,
and
a
heavy
bag
of
gold
,
"
said
Blueskin
,
examining
the
articles
on
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
sum
which
incited
the
villain
to
the
murder
,
"
replied
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
But
he
ca
n't
be
far
off
.
<EOS>
He
must
be
gone
to
dispose
of
the
body
.
<EOS>
We
shall
have
him
on
his
return
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
see
where
these
footsteps
lead
to
,
"
said
Blueskin
,
holding
the
light
to
the
floor
.
<EOS>
"
Here
are
some
more
papers
,
Captain
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Give
them
to
me
,
"
replied
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
"
a
letter
,
beginning
'
dearest
<EOS>
Aliva,'--that
's
your
mother
's
name
,
Thames
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
it
,
"
cried
Thames
,
snatching
it
from
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
_
is
_
addressed
to
my
mother
,
"
he
added
,
as
his
eye
glanced
rapidly
over
it
,
"
and
by
my
father
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
I
shall
ascertain
my
name
.
<EOS>
Bring
the
light
this
way
--
quick
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
decipher
the
signature
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Jack
was
about
to
comply
with
the
request
,
when
an
unlooked
-
for
interruption
occurred
.
<EOS>
Having
traced
the
footsteps
to
the
wall
,
and
perceiving
no
outlet
,
Blueskin
elevated
the
lamp
,
and
discovered
marks
of
bloody
fingers
on
the
boards
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
must
have
gone
this
way
,
"
muttered
Blueskin
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
often
heard
of
a
secret
door
in
this
room
,
though
I
never
saw
it
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
somewhere
hereabouts
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
as
his
eye
fell
upon
a
small
knob
in
the
wall
,
"
there
's
the
spring
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
touched
it
,
and
the
door
flew
open
.
 
<EOS>
The
next
moment
,
he
was
felled
to
the
ground
by
Jonathan
Wild
,
who
sprang
into
the
room
,
followed
by
Abraham
bearing
the
link
.
<EOS>
A
single
glance
served
to
show
the
thief
-
taker
how
matters
stood
.
<EOS>
From
the
slight
sounds
that
had
reached
him
in
his
place
of
confinement
,
he
was
aware
that
some
persons
had
found
their
way
to
the
scene
of
slaughter
,
and
in
a
state
of
the
most
intense
anxiety
awaited
the
result
of
their
investigation
,
prepared
for
the
worst
.
<EOS>
Hearing
the
spring
touched
,
he
dashed
through
on
the
instant
,
and
struck
down
the
person
who
presented
himself
,
with
his
bludgeon
.
<EOS>
On
beholding
the
intruders
,
his
fears
changed
to
exultation
,
and
he
uttered
a
roar
of
satisfaction
as
he
glared
at
them
,
which
could
only
be
likened
to
the
cry
of
some
savage
denizen
of
the
plains
.
 
<EOS>
On
his
appearance
,
Jack
levelled
a
pistol
at
his
head
.
<EOS>
But
his
hand
was
withheld
by
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
fire
,
"
cried
the
latter
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
important
not
to
slay
him
.
<EOS>
He
shall
expiate
his
offences
on
the
gibbet
.
<EOS>
You
are
my
prisoner
,
murderer
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
_
Your
_
prisoner
!
"
echoed
Jonathan
,
derisively
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
mistake,--you
are
mine
.
<EOS>
And
so
is
your
companion,--the
convict
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Waste
not
another
word
with
him
,
Thames
,
"
cried
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Upon
him
!
"
 
"
Yield
,
villain
,
or
die
!
"
shouted
Thames
,
drawing
his
sword
and
springing
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
my
answer
!
"
<EOS>
rejoined
Wild
,
hurling
the
bludgeon
at
him
,
with
such
fatal
effect
,
that
striking
him
on
the
head
it
brought
him
instantly
to
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
traitor
!
"
cried
Jack
,
pulling
the
trigger
of
his
pistol
.
 
<EOS>
Anticipating
this
,
Wild
avoided
the
shot
by
suddenly
,
ducking
his
head
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
narrow
escape
,
however
;
for
,
passing
within
an
inch
of
him
,
the
bullet
burried
itself
deeply
in
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
Before
he
could
fire
a
second
shot
,
Jack
had
to
defend
himself
from
the
thief
-
taker
,
who
,
with
his
drawn
hanger
,
furiously
assaulted
him
.
<EOS>
Eluding
the
blow
,
Jack
plucked
his
sword
from
the
scabbard
,
and
a
desperate
conflict
began
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pick
up
that
blade
,
Nab
,
"
vociferated
Wild
,
finding
himself
hotly
pressed
,
"
and
stab
him
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
give
him
a
chance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Cowardly
villain
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jack
,
as
the
Jew
,
obeying
the
orders
of
his
principal
,
snatched
up
the
weapon
of
the
murdered
man
,
and
assailed
him
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
'll
yet
disappoint
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
springing
backwards
,
he
darted
suddenly
through
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
After
him
,
"
cried
Wild
;
"
he
must
n't
escape
.
<EOS>
Dead
or
alive
,
I
'll
have
him
.
<EOS>
Bring
the
link
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
followed
by
Abraham
,
he
rushed
out
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
Just
as
Jack
got
half
way
down
the
stairs
,
and
Wild
and
the
Jew
reached
the
upper
landing
,
the
street
-
door
was
opened
by
Langley
and
Ireton
,
the
latter
of
whom
carried
a
lantern
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stop
him
!
"
shouted
Jonathan
from
the
stair
-
head
,
"
stop
him
!
<EOS>
It
's
Jack
Sheppard
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Give
way
!
"
cried
Jack
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
cut
down
him
who
opposes
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
head
turnkey
,
in
all
probability
,
would
have
obeyed
.
<EOS>
But
,
being
pushed
forward
by
his
subordinate
officer
,
he
was
compelled
to
make
a
stand
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
'd
better
surrender
quietly
,
Jack
,
"
he
cried
;
"
you
've
no
chance
.
"
<EOS>
'
 
Instead
of
regarding
him
,
Jack
glanced
over
the
iron
bannisters
,
and
measured
the
distance
.
<EOS>
But
the
fall
was
too
great
,
and
he
abandoned
the
attempt
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
him
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jonathan
,
hurrying
down
the
steps
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
ca
n't
escape
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
this
was
said
,
Jack
turned
with
the
swiftness
of
thought
,
and
shortening
his
sword
,
prepared
to
plunge
it
into
the
thief
-
taker
's
heart
.
<EOS>
Before
he
could
make
the
thrust
,
however
,
he
was
seized
behind
by
Ireton
,
who
flung
himself
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Caught
!
"
shouted
the
head
-
turnkey
.
<EOS>
"
I
give
you
joy
of
the
capture
,
Mr.
Wild
,
"
he
added
,
as
Jonathan
came
up
,
and
assisted
him
to
secure
and
disarm
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
coming
to
give
you
intelligence
of
a
comical
trick
played
by
this
rascal
,
when
I
find
him
here
--
<EOS>
the
last
place
,
I
own
,
where
I
should
have
expected
to
find
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
've
arrived
in
the
very
nick
of
time
,
"
rejoined
Jonathan
;
"
and
I
'll
take
care
your
services
are
not
overlooked
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Ireton
,
"
cried
Jack
,
in
accents
of
the
most
urgent
entreaty
,
"
before
you
take
me
hence
<EOS>
,
I
implore
you
--
if
you
would
further
the
ends
of
justice
--
search
this
house
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
most
barbarous
murders
ever
committed
has
just
been
perpetrated
by
the
monster
Wild
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
proofs
of
the
bloody
deed
in
his
room
.
<EOS>
But
go
thither
at
once
,
I
beseech
you
,
before
he
has
time
to
remove
them
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Ireton
is
welcome
to
search
every
room
in
my
house
if
he
pleases
,
"
said
Jonathan
,
in
a
tone
of
bravado
.
<EOS>
"
As
soon
as
we
've
conveyed
you
to
Newgate
,
I
'll
accompany
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Ireton
will
do
no
such
thing
,
"
replied
the
head
-
turnkey
.
<EOS>
"
Bless
your
soul
!
d'ye
<EOS>
think
I
'm
to
be
gammoned
by
such
nonsense
.
<EOS>
Not
I.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
quite
such
a
greenhorn
as
Shotbolt
,
Jack
,
whatever
you
may
think
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
For
mercy
's
sake
go
up
stairs
,
"
implored
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
told
you
half
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
man
dying
--
Captain
Darrell
.
<EOS>
Take
me
with
you
.
<EOS>
Place
a
pistol
at
my
ear
,
and
shoot
me
,
if
I
've
told
you
false
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
,
what
good
would
that
do
?
"
<EOS>
replied
Ireton
,
sarcastically
.
<EOS>
"
To
shoot
you
would
be
to
lose
the
reward
.
<EOS>
You
act
your
part
capitally
,
but
it
wo
n't
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
you
go
?
"
cried
Jack
passionately
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Langley
,
I
appeal
to
you
.
<EOS>
Murder
,
I
say
,
has
been
done
!
<EOS>
Another
murder
will
be
committed
if
you
do
n't
prevent
it
.
<EOS>
The
blood
will
rest
on
your
head
.
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
me
,
Sir
?
<EOS>
Wo
n't
you
stir
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
a
step
,
"
replied
Langley
,
gruffly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Off
with
him
to
Newgate
!
"
cried
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ireton
,
as
you
captured
him
,
the
reward
is
yours
.
<EOS>
But
I
request
that
a
third
may
be
given
to
Langley
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
shall
be
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Ireton
,
bowing
.
"
<EOS>
Now
come
along
,
Jack
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Miscreants
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Sheppard
,
almost
driven
frantic
by
the
violence
of
his
emotions
;
"
you
're
all
in
league
with
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Away
with
him
!
"
cried
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
see
him
fettered
myself
.
<EOS>
Remain
at
the
door
,
Nab
<EOS>
,
"
he
added
,
loitering
for
a
moment
behind
the
others
,
"
and
let
no
one
in
,
or
out
.
"
 
<EOS>
Jack
,
meanwhile
,
was
carried
to
Newgate
.
<EOS>
Austin
could
scarcely
credit
his
senses
when
he
beheld
him
.
<EOS>
Shotbolt
,
who
had
in
some
degree
recovered
from
the
effects
of
his
previous
mortification
,
was
thrown
into
an
ecstacy
of
delight
,
and
could
not
sufficiently
exult
over
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Spurling
had
retired
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
Jack
appealed
to
the
new
auditors
,
and
again
detailed
his
story
,
but
with
no
better
success
than
heretofore
.
<EOS>
His
statement
was
treated
with
derision
.
<EOS>
Having
seen
him
heavily
ironed
,
and
placed
in
the
Condemned
Hold
,
Jonathan
recrossed
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
He
found
Abraham
on
guard
as
he
had
left
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Has
any
one
been
here
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
von
,
"
replied
the
Jew
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
well
,
"
replied
Wild
,
entering
the
house
,
and
fastening
the
door
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
to
dispose
of
our
dead
.
<EOS>
Why
,
Nab
,
you
shake
as
if
you
'd
got
an
ague
?
<EOS>
"
he
added
,
turning
to
the
Jew
,
whose
teeth
chattered
audibly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
quite
recovered
the
fright
<EOS>
I
got
in
the
Vell
-
Hole
,
"
replied
Abraham
.
 
<EOS>
On
returning
to
the
audience
-
chamber
,
Jonathan
found
the
inanimate
body
of
Thames
Darrell
lying
where
he
had
left
it
;
but
,
on
examining
it
,
he
remarked
that
the
pockets
were
turned
inside
out
,
and
had
evidently
been
rifled
.
<EOS>
Startled
by
this
circumstance
,
he
looked
around
,
and
perceived
that
the
trap
-
door,--which
has
been
mentioned
as
communicating
with
a
secret
staircase,--was
open
.
<EOS>
He
,
next
,
discovered
that
Blueskin
was
gone
;
and
,
pursuing
his
scrutiny
,
found
that
he
had
carried
off
all
the
banknotes
,
gold
,
and
letters,--including
,
what
Jonathan
himself
was
not
aware
<EOS>
of,--the
<EOS>
two
packets
which
he
had
abstracted
from
the
person
of
Thames
.
<EOS>
Uttering
a
terrible
imprecation
,
Jonathan
snatched
up
the
link
,
and
hastily
descended
the
stairs
,
leaving
the
Jew
behind
him
.
<EOS>
After
a
careful
search
below
,
he
could
detect
no
trace
of
Blueskin
.
<EOS>
But
,
finding
the
cellar
-
door
open
,
concluded
he
had
got
out
that
way
.
 
<EOS>
Returning
to
the
audience
-
chamber
in
a
by
-
no
-
means
enviable
state
of
mind
,
he
commanded
the
Jew
to
throw
the
body
of
Thames
into
the
Well
Hole
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
musht
do
dat
shob
yourself
,
Mishter
Vild
,
"
rejoined
Abraham
,
shaking
his
head
.
"
<EOS>
No
prize
shall
indushe
me
to
enter
dat
horrid
plashe
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Fool
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Wild
,
taking
up
the
body
,
"
what
are
you
afraid
of
?
<EOS>
After
all
,
"
he
added
,
pausing
,
"
he
may
be
of
more
use
to
me
alive
than
dead
.
"
 
<EOS>
Adhering
to
this
change
of
plan
,
he
ordered
Abraham
to
follow
him
,
and
,
descending
the
secret
stairs
once
more
,
carried
the
wounded
man
into
the
lower
part
of
the
premises
.
<EOS>
Unlocking
several
doors
,
he
came
to
a
dark
vault
,
that
would
have
rivalled
the
gloomiest
cell
in
Newgate
,
into
which
he
thrust
Thames
,
and
fastened
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
Go
to
the
pump
,
Nab
,
"
he
said
,
when
this
was
done
,
"
and
fill
a
pail
with
water
.
<EOS>
We
must
wash
out
those
stains
up
stairs
,
and
burn
the
cloth
.
<EOS>
Blood
,
they
say
,
wo
n't
come
out
.
<EOS>
But
I
never
found
any
truth
in
the
saying
.
<EOS>
When
I
've
had
an
hour
's
rest
,
I
'll
be
after
Blueskin
.

CHAPTER
XV
.
 
<EOS>
How
Blueskin
underwent
the
Peine
Forte
et
Dure
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
it
became
known
,
through
the
medium
of
the
public
prints
on
the
following
day
,
that
Jack
Sheppard
had
broken
out
of
prison
,
and
had
been
again
captured
during
the
night
,
fresh
curiosity
was
excited
,
and
larger
crowds
than
ever
flocked
to
Newgate
,
in
the
hope
of
obtaining
admission
to
his
cell
;
but
by
the
governor
's
express
commands
,
Wild
having
privately
counselled
the
step
,
no
one
was
allowed
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
A
question
next
arose
whether
the
prisoner
could
be
executed
under
the
existing
warrant,--some
inclining
to
one
opinion
,
some
to
another
.
<EOS>
To
settle
the
point
,
the
governor
started
to
Windsor
,
delegating
his
trust
in
the
interim
to
Wild
,
who
took
advantage
of
his
brief
rule
to
adopt
the
harshest
measures
towards
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
He
had
him
removed
from
the
Condemned
Hold
,
stripped
of
his
fine
apparel
,
clothed
in
the
most
sordid
rags
,
loaded
with
additional
fetters
,
and
thrust
into
the
Stone
Hold,--already
described
as
the
most
noisome
cell
in
the
whole
prison
.
<EOS>
Here
,
without
a
glimpse
of
daylight
;
visited
by
no
one
except
Austin
at
stated
intervals
,
who
neither
answered
a
question
nor
addressed
a
word
to
him
;
fed
upon
the
worst
diet
,
literally
mouldy
bread
and
ditch
-
water
;
surrounded
by
stone
walls
;
with
a
flagged
floor
for
his
pillow
,
and
without
so
much
as
a
blanket
to
protect
him
from
the
death
-
like
cold
that
pierced
his
frame,--Jack
's
stout
heart
was
subdued
,
and
he
fell
into
the
deepest
dejection
,
ardently
longing
for
the
time
when
even
a
violent
death
should
terminate
his
sufferings
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
so
ordered
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Pitt
returned
with
intelligence
that
the
warrant
was
delayed
,
and
,
on
taking
the
opinion
of
two
eminent
lawyers
of
the
day
,
Sir
William
Thomson
and
Mr.
Serjeant
Raby
,
it
was
decided
that
it
must
be
proved
in
a
regular
and
judicial
manner
that
Sheppard
was
the
identical
person
who
had
been
convicted
and
had
escaped
,
before
a
fresh
order
could
be
made
for
his
execution
;
and
that
the
matter
must
,
therefore
,
stand
over
until
the
next
sessions
,
to
be
held
at
the
Old
Bailey
in
October
,
when
it
could
be
brought
before
the
court
.
 
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
prisoner
,
meanwhile
,
who
was
not
informed
of
the
respite
,
languished
in
his
horrible
dungeon
,
and
,
at
the
expiration
of
three
weeks
,
became
so
seriously
indisposed
that
it
was
feared
he
could
not
long
survive
.
<EOS>
He
refused
his
food,--and
even
when
better
provisions
were
offered
him
,
rejected
them
.
<EOS>
As
his
death
was
by
no
means
what
Jonathan
desired
,
he
resolved
to
remove
him
to
a
more
airy
ward
,
and
afford
him
such
slight
comforts
as
might
tend
to
his
restoration
,
or
at
least
keep
him
alive
until
the
period
of
execution
.
<EOS>
With
this
view
,
Jack
was
carried
--
for
he
was
no
longer
able
to
move
without
assistance
--
to
a
ward
called
the
Castle
,
situated
over
the
gateway
on
the
western
side
,
in
what
was
considered
the
strongest
part
of
the
jail
.
<EOS>
The
walls
were
of
immense
thickness
;
the
small
windows
double
-
grated
and
unglazed
;
the
fire
-
place
was
without
a
grate
;
and
a
barrack
-
bed
,
divided
into
two
compartments
,
occupied
one
corner
.
<EOS>
It
was
about
twelve
feet
high
,
nine
wide
,
and
fourteen
long
;
and
was
approached
by
double
doors
each
six
inches
thick
.
<EOS>
As
Jack
appeared
to
be
sinking
fast
,
his
fetters
were
removed
,
his
own
clothes
were
returned
to
him
,
and
he
was
allowed
a
mattress
and
a
scanty
supply
of
bed
-
linen
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Spurling
attended
him
as
his
nurse
,
and
,
under
her
care
,
he
speedily
revived
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
became
convalescent
,
and
all
fears
of
his
premature
dissolution
were
at
an
end
,
Wild
recommenced
his
rigorous
treatment
.
<EOS>
The
bedding
was
removed
;
Mrs.
Spurling
was
no
longer
allowed
to
visit
him
;
he
was
again
loaded
with
irons
;
fastened
by
an
enormous
horse
-
padlock
to
a
staple
in
the
floor
;
and
only
allowed
to
take
repose
in
a
chair
.
<EOS>
A
single
blanket
constituted
his
sole
covering
at
night
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
all
this
,
he
grew
daily
better
and
stronger
,
and
his
spirits
revived
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
no
visiters
had
been
permitted
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
As
the
time
when
his
identity
had
to
be
proved
approached
,
this
rigour
was
,
in
a
trifling
degree
,
relaxed
,
and
a
few
persons
were
occasionally
admitted
to
the
ward
,
but
only
in
the
presence
of
Austin
.
<EOS>
From
none
of
these
could
Jack
ascertain
what
had
become
of
Thames
,
or
learn
any
particulars
concerning
the
family
at
Dollis
Hill
,
or
of
his
mother
.
<EOS>
Austin
,
who
had
been
evidently
schooled
by
Wild
,
maintained
a
profound
silence
on
this
head
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
,
more
than
a
month
passed
over
.
<EOS>
October
arrived
;
and
in
another
week
the
court
would
be
sitting
at
the
Old
Bailey
.
 
<EOS>
One
night
,
about
this
time
,
just
as
Austin
was
about
to
lock
the
great
gate
,
Jonathan
Wild
and
his
two
janizaries
entered
the
Lodge
with
a
prisoner
bound
hand
and
foot
.
<EOS>
It
was
Blueskin
.
<EOS>
On
the
cords
being
removed
,
he
made
a
desperate
spring
at
Wild
,
bore
him
to
the
ground
,
clutched
at
his
throat
,
and
would
,
infallibly
,
have
strangled
him
,
if
the
keepers
had
not
all
thrown
themselves
upon
him
,
and
by
main
force
torn
him
off
.
<EOS>
His
struggles
were
so
violent
,
that
,
being
a
man
of
tremendous
strength
,
it
was
some
time
before
they
could
master
him
,
and
it
required
the
combined
efforts
of
all
the
four
partners
to
put
him
into
irons
.
<EOS>
It
appeared
from
what
he
said
that
he
had
been
captured
when
asleep,--that
his
liquor
had
been
drugged,--otherwise
,
he
would
never
have
allowed
himself
to
be
taken
alive
.
<EOS>
Wild
,
he
asserted
,
had
robbed
him
of
a
large
sum
of
money
,
and
till
it
was
restored
he
would
never
plead
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
'll
see
that
,
"
replied
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
Take
him
to
the
bilbowes
.
<EOS>
Put
him
in
the
stocks
,
and
there
let
him
sleep
off
his
drunken
fit
.
<EOS>
Whether
he
pleads
or
not
,
he
shall
swing
with
his
confederate
,
Jack
Sheppard
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
allusion
to
his
leader
,
a
shudder
passed
through
Blueskin
's
athletic
frame
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
is
he
?
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
him
.
<EOS>
Let
me
have
a
word
with
him
,
and
you
may
take
all
the
money
.
"
 
<EOS>
Jonathan
made
no
answer
,
but
motioned
the
partners
to
take
him
away
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
Blueskin
was
removed
,
Wild
intimated
his
intention
of
visiting
the
Castle
.
<EOS>
He
was
accompanied
by
Ireton
and
Austin
.
<EOS>
The
massive
door
was
unlocked
,
and
they
entered
the
cell
.
<EOS>
What
was
their
surprise
to
find
it
vacant
,
and
the
prisoner
gone
!
<EOS>
Jonathan
,
could
scarcely
believe
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
He
looked
fiercely
and
inquiringly
from
one
to
the
other
of
his
companions
;
but
,
though
both
of
them
were
excessively
frightened
,
neither
appeared
guilty
.
<EOS>
Before
a
word
could
be
said
,
however
,
a
slight
noise
was
heard
in
the
chimney
,
and
Jack
with
his
irons
on
descended
from
it
.
<EOS>
Without
betraying
the
slightest
confusion
,
or
making
a
single
remark
,
he
quietly
resumed
his
seat
.
 
<EOS>
"
Amazement
!
"
cried
Wild
.
<EOS>
"
How
has
he
unfastened
his
padlock
?
<EOS>
Austin
,
it
must
be
owing
to
your
negligence
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
negligence
,
Mr.
Wild
,
"
said
the
turnkey
,
trembling
in
every
joint
.
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
,
Sir
,
when
I
left
him
an
hour
ago
,
it
was
locked
.
<EOS>
I
tried
it
myself
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
I
'm
as
much
astonished
as
you
.
<EOS>
But
I
ca
n't
account
for
it
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
At
all
events
,
you
shall
answer
for
it
,
"
thundered
Wild
,
with
a
bitter
imprecation
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
not
to
blame
,
"
said
Jack
,
rising
.
<EOS>
"
I
opened
the
padlock
with
this
crooked
nail
,
which
I
found
in
the
floor
.
<EOS>
If
you
had
arrived
ten
minutes
later
,
or
if
there
had
n't
been
an
iron
bar
in
the
chimney
,
that
hindered
my
progress
,
I
should
have
been
beyond
your
reach
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
talk
boldly
,
"
replied
Wild
.
<EOS>
"
Go
to
the
Iron
Hold
,
Austin
,
and
tell
two
of
the
partners
to
bring
another
padlock
of
the
largest
size
,
and
the
heaviest
handcuffs
they
can
find
.
<EOS>
We
'll
try
whether
he
'll
get
loose
again
.
"
 
<EOS>
Sheppard
said
nothing
,
but
a
disdainful
smile
curled
his
lips
.
 
<EOS>
Austin
departed
,
and
presently
afterwards
returned
with
the
two
subordinate
officers
,
each
of
whom
wore
a
leathern
apron
round
his
waist
,
and
carried
a
large
hammer
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
manacles
were
slipped
over
the
prisoner
's
wrists
,
and
the
new
padlock
secured
to
the
staple
,
they
withdrew
.
 
<EOS>
"
Leave
me
alone
with
him
a
moment
,
"
said
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
And
the
jailers
also
retired
.
 
<EOS>
"
Jack
,
"
said
Wild
,
with
a
glance
of
malignant
triumph
,
"
I
will
now
tell
you
what
I
have
done
.
<EOS>
All
my
plans
have
succeeded
.
<EOS>
Before
a
month
has
elapsed
,
your
mother
will
be
mine
.
<EOS>
The
Trenchard
estates
will
likewise
be
mine
,
for
Sir
Rowland
is
no
more
,
and
the
youth
,
Thames
,
will
never
again
see
daylight
.
<EOS>
Blueskin
,
who
had
evaded
me
with
the
papers
and
the
money
,
is
a
prisoner
here
,
and
will
perish
on
the
same
gallows
as
yourself
.
<EOS>
My
vengeance
is
completely
gratified
.
"
 
<EOS>
Without
waiting
for
a
reply
,
but
darting
a
malevolent
look
at
the
prisoner
,
he
quitted
the
cell
,
the
door
of
which
was
instantly
double
-
locked
and
bolted
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
not
quite
done
yet
,
"
said
Jonathan
,
as
he
joined
the
turnkeys
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
see
whether
Blueskin
is
a
little
more
composed
.
<EOS>
I
've
a
question
to
ask
him
.
<EOS>
Give
me
the
keys
and
the
light
.
<EOS>
I
'll
go
alone
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
descended
a
short
spiral
staircase
,
and
,
entering
a
long
stone
gallery
,
from
which
several
other
passages
branched
,
took
one
of
them
,
and
after
various
turnings
--
for
he
was
familiar
with
all
the
intricacies
of
the
prison
--
arrived
at
the
cell
of
which
he
was
in
search
.
<EOS>
Selecting
a
key
from
the
heavy
bunch
committed
to
him
by
Austin
,
he
threw
open
the
door
,
and
beheld
Blueskin
seated
at
the
back
of
the
small
chamber
,
handcuffed
,
and
<EOS>
with
his
feet
confined
in
a
heavy
pair
of
stocks
.
<EOS>
He
was
asleep
when
Jonathan
entered
,
and
growled
at
being
disturbed
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
soon
as
he
perceived
who
it
was
,
he
roused
himself
,
and
glared
fiercely
at
the
intruder
from
under
his
bent
brows
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
,
in
a
gruff
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
know
what
you
've
done
with
the
rest
of
the
notes
--
with
the
gold
--
and
the
papers
you
took
away
from
my
room
!
<EOS>
"
rejoined
Wild
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
you
'll
never
know
more
than
this
,
"
retorted
Blueskin
,
with
a
grin
of
satisfaction;--"they're
in
a
place
of
safety
,
where
_
you_'ll
never
find
'em
,
but
where
somebody
else
_
will
_
,
and
that
before
long
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hear
me
,
Blueskin
,
"
said
Jonathan
,
restraining
his
choler
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
'll
tell
me
where
to
look
for
these
things
,
and
I
_
do
_
find
them
,
I
'll
set
you
free
.
<EOS>
And
you
shall
have
a
share
of
the
gold
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
'll
do
,
"
rejoined
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
Set
Captain
Sheppard
free
,
and
when
I
hear
he
's
<EOS>
safe,--not
before,--I'll
put
the
money
and
papers
into
your
possession
,
and
some
other
matters
,
too
,
that
you
know
nothing
about
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Impracticable
dolt
!
"
exclaimed
Jonathan
,
furiously
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
think
I
'd
part
with
the
sweetest
morsel
of
revenge
on
those
terms
?
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
But
I
'll
have
the
secret
out
of
you
by
other
means
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
violently
shut
and
locked
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
About
ten
days
after
this
interview
,
Blueskin
,
having
been
indicted
by
Wild
for
several
robberies
,
and
true
bills
found
against
him
,
was
placed
at
the
bar
of
the
Old
Bailey
to
be
arraigned
;
when
he
declared
that
he
would
not
plead
to
the
indictment
,
unless
the
sum
of
five
hundred
pounds
,
taken
from
him
by
Jonathan
Wild
,
was
first
restored
to
him
.
<EOS>
This
sum
,
claimed
by
Wild
under
the
statute
4th
and
5th
of
William
and
Mary
,
entitled
"
_
<EOS>
An
act
for
encouraging
the
apprehending
of
Highwaymen
_
,
"
was
granted
to
him
by
the
court
.
 
<EOS>
As
Blueskin
still
continued
obstinate
,
the
judgment
appointed
to
be
executed
upon
such
prisoners
as
stood
mute
,
was
then
read
.
<EOS>
It
was
as
follows
,
and
,
when
uttered
,
produced
a
strong
effect
upon
all
who
heard
it
,
except
the
prisoner
,
who
,
in
no
respect
,
altered
his
sullen
and
dogged
demeanour
.
 
<EOS>
"
Prisoner
at
the
bar
,
"
thus
ran
the
sentence
,
"
you
shall
be
taken
to
the
prison
from
whence
you
came
,
and
put
into
a
mean
room
,
stopped
from
the
light
;
and
shall
there
be
laid
on
the
bare
ground
,
without
any
litter
,
straw
,
or
other
covering
,
and
without
any
garment
.
<EOS>
You
shall
lie
upon
your
back
;
your
head
shall
be
covered
;
and
your
feet
shall
be
bare
.
<EOS>
One
of
your
arms
shall
be
drawn
to
one
side
of
the
room
,
and
the
other
arm
to
the
other
side
,
and
your
legs
shall
be
served
in
the
like
manner
.
<EOS>
Then
,
there
shall
be
laid
upon
your
body
as
much
iron
,
or
stone
as
you
can
bear
,
and
more
.
<EOS>
And
the
first
day
,
you
shall
have
three
morsels
of
barley
bread
,
without
any
drink
;
and
the
second
day
,
you
shall
be
allowed
to
drink
as
much
as
you
can
,
at
three
times
,
of
the
water
that
is
next
to
the
prison
-
door
,
except
running
-
water
,
without
any
bread
.
<EOS>
And
this
shall
be
your
diet
till
you
die
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Prisoner
at
the
bar
,
"
continued
the
clerk
of
the
court
,
"
he
against
whom
this
judgment
is
given
,
forfeits
his
goods
to
the
king
.
"
 
<EOS>
An
awful
silence
prevailed
throughout
the
court
.
<EOS>
Every
eye
was
fixed
upon
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
he
made
no
answer
,
he
was
removed
.
 
<EOS>
Before
the
full
sentence
was
carried
into
execution
,
he
was
taken
into
a
small
room
adjoining
the
court
.
<EOS>
Here
Marvel
,
the
executioner
,
who
was
in
attendance
,
was
commanded
by
Wild
to
tie
his
thumbs
together
,
which
he
did
with
whipcord
so
tightly
,
that
the
string
cut
to
the
bone
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
this
produced
no
effect
,
and
did
not
even
elicit
a
groan
,
the
prisoner
was
carried
back
to
Newgate
.
 
<EOS>
The
Press
Room
,
to
which
Blueskin
was
conveyed
on
his
arrival
at
the
jail
,
was
a
small
square
chamber
,
walled
and
paved
with
stone
.
<EOS>
In
each
corner
stood
a
stout
square
post
reaching
to
the
ceiling
.
<EOS>
To
these
a
heavy
wooden
apparatus
was
attached
,
which
could
be
raised
or
lowered
at
pleasure
by
pullies
.
<EOS>
In
the
floor
were
set
four
ring
-
bolts
,
about
nine
feet
apart
.
<EOS>
When
the
prisoner
was
brought
into
this
room
,
he
was
again
questioned
;
but
,
continuing
contumacious
,
preparations
were
made
for
inflicting
the
torture
.
<EOS>
His
great
personal
strength
being
so
well
known
,
it
was
deemed
prudent
by
Marvel
to
have
all
the
four
partners
,
together
with
Caliban
,
in
attendance
.
<EOS>
The
prisoner
,
however
,
submitted
more
quietly
than
was
anticipated
.
<EOS>
He
allowed
his
irons
and
clothes
to
be
taken
off
without
resistance
.
<EOS>
But
just
as
they
were
about
to
place
him
on
the
ground
,
he
burst
from
their
hold
,
and
made
a
desperate
spring
at
Jonathan
,
who
was
standing
with
his
arms
folded
near
the
door
watching
the
scene
.
<EOS>
The
attempt
was
unsuccessful
.
<EOS>
He
was
instantly
overpowered
,
and
stretched
upon
the
ground
.
<EOS>
The
four
men
fell
upon
him
,
holding
his
arms
and
legs
,
while
Caliban
forced
back
his
head
.
<EOS>
In
this
state
,
he
contrived
to
get
the
poor
black
's
hand
into
his
mouth
,
and
nearly
bit
off
one
of
his
fingers
before
the
sufferer
could
be
rescued
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
executioner
had
attached
strong
cords
to
his
ankles
and
wrists
,
and
fastened
them
tightly
to
the
iron
rings
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
he
unloosed
the
pulley
,
and
the
ponderous
machine
,
which
resembled
a
trough
,
slowly
descended
upon
the
prisoner
's
breast
.
<EOS>
Marvel
,
then
,
took
two
iron
weights
,
each
of
a
hundred
pounds
,
and
placed
them
in
the
press
.
<EOS>
As
this
seemed
insufficient
,
after
a
lapse
of
five
minutes
,
he
added
another
hundred
weight
.
<EOS>
The
prisoner
breathed
with
difficulty
.
<EOS>
Still
,
his
robust
frame
enabled
him
to
hold
out
.
<EOS>
After
he
had
endured
this
torture
for
an
hour
,
at
a
sign
from
Wild
another
hundred
weight
was
added
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
,
an
appalling
change
was
perceptible
.
<EOS>
The
veins
in
his
throat
and
forehead
swelled
and
blackened
;
his
eyes
protruded
from
their
sockets
,
and
stared
wildly
;
a
thick
damp
gathered
on
his
brow
:
and
blood
gushed
from
his
mouth
,
nostrils
,
and
ears
.
 
<EOS>
"
Water
!
"
<EOS>
he
gasped
.
 
<EOS>
The
executioner
shook
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
submit
?
<EOS>
"
interrogated
Wild
.
 
<EOS>
Blueskin
answered
by
dashing
his
head
violently
against
the
flagged
floor
.
<EOS>
His
efforts
at
self
-
destruction
were
,
however
,
prevented
.
 
<EOS>
"
Try
fifty
pounds
more
,
"
said
Jonathan
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stop
!
"
groaned
Blueskin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
plead
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Wild
,
harshly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
"
answered
the
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
"
Release
him
,
"
said
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
cured
his
obstinacy
,
you
perceive
,
"
he
added
to
Marvel
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
_
will
_
live
,
"
cried
Blueskin
,
with
a
look
of
the
deadliest
hatred
at
Wild
,
"
to
be
revenged
on
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
as
the
weights
were
removed
,
he
fainted
.

CHAPTER
XVI
.
 
<EOS>
How
Jack
Sheppard
's
Portrait
was
painted
.
  
<EOS>
Early
in
the
morning
of
Thursday
,
the
15th
of
October
,
1724
,
the
door
of
the
Castle
was
opened
by
Austin
,
who
,
with
a
look
of
unusual
importance
,
announced
to
the
prisoner
that
four
gentlemen
were
shortly
coming
up
with
the
governor
to
see
him,--"four
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
such
_
gentlemen
,
"
he
added
,
in
a
tone
meant
to
impress
his
auditor
with
a
due
sense
of
the
honour
intended
him
,
"
as
you
do
n't
meet
every
day
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Is
Mr.
Wood
among
them
?
"
asked
Jack
,
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Wood!--no
,
"
replied
the
turnkey
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
think
I
'd
take
the
trouble
to
announce
_
him
_
?
<EOS>
These
are
persons
of
consequence
,
I
tell
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Who
are
they
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Sheppard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
first
,
"
rejoined
Austin
,
"
there
's
Sir
James
Thornhill
,
historical
painter
to
his
Majesty
,
and
the
greatest
artist
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
Those
grand
designs
in
the
dome
of
St.
Paul
's
are
his
work
.
<EOS>
So
is
the
roof
of
the
state
-
room
at
Hampton
Court
Palace
,
occupied
by
Queen
Anne
,
and
the
Prince
of
Denmark
.
<EOS>
So
is
the
chapel
of
All
Souls
at
Oxford
,
and
the
great
hall
at
Blenheim
,
and
I
do
n't
know
how
many
halls
and
chapels
besides
.
<EOS>
He
's
now
engaged
on
the
hall
at
Greenwich
Hospital
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
heard
of
him
,
"
replied
Jack
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"
Who
are
the
others
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
friend
of
Sir
James
--
a
young
man
,
an
engraver
of
masquerade
tickets
and
caricatures,--his
name
I
believe
is
Hogarth
.
<EOS>
Then
,
there
's
Mr.
Gay
,
the
poet
,
who
wrote
the
'
Captives
,
'
which
was
lately
acted
at
Drury
Lane
,
and
was
so
much
admired
by
the
Princess
of
Wales
.
<EOS>
And
,
lastly
,
there
's
Mr.
Figg
,
the
noted
prize
-
fighter
,
from
the
New
Amphitheatre
in
Marylebone
Fields
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Figg
's
an
old
friend
of
mine
,
"
rejoined
Jack
;
"
he
was
my
instructor
in
the
small
sword
and
back
sword
exercise
.
<EOS>
I
'm
glad
he
's
come
to
see
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
inquire
what
brings
Sir
James
Thornhill
here
?
"
said
Austin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Curiosity
,
I
suppose
,
"
returned
Jack
,
carelessly
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
such
thing
,
"
rejoined
the
jailer
;
"
he
's
coming
on
business
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
On
what
business
,
in
the
name
of
wonder
?
"
asked
Sheppard
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
paint
your
portrait
,
"
answered
the
jailer
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
portrait
!
"
echoed
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
desire
of
his
Majesty
,
"
said
the
jailer
,
consequentially
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
has
heard
of
your
wonderful
escapes
,
and
wishes
to
see
what
you
're
like
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
feather
in
your
cap
!
<EOS>
No
house
-
breaker
was
ever
so
highly
honoured
before
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
have
my
escapes
really
made
so
much
noise
as
to
reach
the
ear
of
royalty
?
"
<EOS>
mused
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
done
nothing
--
nothing
to
what
I
_
<EOS>
could
_
do
--
to
<EOS>
what
I
_
will
_
do
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
've
done
quite
enough
,
"
rejoined
Austin
;
"
more
than
you
'll
ever
do
again
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
then
to
be
taken
thus
,
in
these
disgraceful
bonds
!
"
<EOS>
continued
Jack
,
"
to
be
held
up
as
a
sight
for
ever
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
how
else
would
you
be
taken
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
jailer
,
with
a
coarse
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
well
Mr.
Wild
allowed
you
to
have
your
fine
clothes
again
,
or
you
might
have
been
taken
in
a
still
more
disgraceful
garb
.
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
I
think
those
shackles
extremely
becoming
.
<EOS>
But
,
here
they
are
.
"
 
<EOS>
Voices
being
heard
at
the
door
,
Austin
flew
to
open
it
,
and
admitted
Mr.
Pitt
,
the
governor
,
a
tall
pompous
personage
,
who
,
in
his
turn
,
ushered
in
four
other
individuals
.
<EOS>
The
first
of
these
,
whom
he
addressed
as
Mr.
Gay
,
was
a
stout
,
good
-
looking
,
good
-
humoured
man
,
about
thirty
-
six
,
with
a
dark
complexion
,
an
oval
face
,
fine
black
eyes
,
full
of
fire
and
sensibility
,
and
twinkling
with
roguish
humour
--
an
expression
fully
borne
out
by
the
mouth
,
which
had
a
very
shrewd
and
sarcastic
curl
.
<EOS>
The
poet
's
appearance
altogether
was
highly
prepossessing
.
<EOS>
With
a
strong
tendency
to
satire
,
but
without
a
particle
of
malice
or
ill
-
nature
in
its
display
.
<EOS>
Gay
,
by
his
strokes
of
pleasantry
,
whether
in
his
writings
or
conversation
,
never
lost
a
friend
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
he
was
a
universal
favourite
,
and
numbered
amongst
his
intimate
acquaintances
the
choicest
spirits
of
the
time,--Pope
,
Swift
,
Arbuthnot
,
and
"
all
the
better
brothers
.
<EOS>
"
His
demeanour
was
polished
;
his
manners
singularly
affable
and
gentle
;
and
he
was
remarkable
,
for
the
generosity
of
his
temper
.
<EOS>
In
worldly
matters
Gay
was
not
fortunate
.
<EOS>
Possessed
,
at
one
time
,
of
a
share
in
the
South
Sea
stock
,
he
conceived
himself
worth
twenty
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
But
,
on
the
bursting
of
that
bubble
,
his
hopes
vanished
with
it
.
<EOS>
Neither
did
his
interest,--which
was
by
no
means
<EOS>
inconsiderable,--nor
his
general
popularity
,
procure
him
the
preferment
he
desired
.
<EOS>
A
constant
attendant
at
court
,
he
had
the
mortification
to
see
every
one
promoted
but
himself
,
and
thus
bewails
his
ill
-
luck
.
     
<EOS>
Places
,
I
found
,
were
daily
given
away
,
    
And
yet
no
friendly
gazette
mentioned
Gay
.
 
<EOS>
The
prodigious
success
of
the
"
Beggars
'
Opera
,
"
which
was
produced
about
four
years
after
the
date
of
this
history
,
rewarded
him
for
all
his
previous
disappointments
,
though
it
did
not
fully
justify
the
well
-
known
epigram
,
alluding
to
himself
and
the
manager
,
and
"
make
Gay
_
rich
_
,
and
Rich
_
gay
_
.
<EOS>
"
At
the
time
of
his
present
introduction
,
his
play
of
"
The
Captives
,
"
had
just
been
produced
at
Drury
Lane
,
and
he
was
meditating
his
"
Fables
,
"
which
were
published
two
years
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
Behind
the
poet
came
Sir
James
Thornhill
.
<EOS>
The
eminent
painter
had
handsome
,
expressive
features
,
an
aquiline
nose
,
and
a
good
deal
of
dignity
in
his
manner
.
<EOS>
His
age
was
not
far
from
fifty
.
<EOS>
He
was
accompanied
by
a
young
man
of
about
seven
-
and
-
twenty
,
who
carried
his
easel
,
set
it
in
its
place
,
laid
the
canvass
upon
it
,
opened
the
paint
box
,
took
out
the
brushes
and
palette
,
and
,
in
short
,
paid
him
the
most
assiduous
attention
.
<EOS>
This
young
man
,
whose
features
,
though
rather
plain
and
coarse
,
bore
the
strongest
impress
of
genius
,
and
who
had
a
dark
gray
,
penetrating
eye
,
so
quick
in
its
glances
that
it
seemed
to
survey
twenty
objects
at
once
,
and
yet
only
to
fasten
upon
one
,
bore
the
honoured
name
of
William
Hogarth
.
<EOS>
Why
he
paid
so
much
attention
to
Sir
James
Thornhill
may
be
explained
anon
.
 
<EOS>
The
rear
of
the
party
was
brought
up
by
a
large
,
powerfully
-
built
man
,
with
a
bluff
,
honest
,
but
rugged
countenance
,
slashed
with
many
a
cut
and
scar
,
and
stamped
with
that
surly
,
sturdy
,
bull
-
dog
-
like
look
,
which
an
Englishman
always
delights
to
contemplate
,
because
he
conceives
it
to
be
characteristic
of
his
countrymen
.
<EOS>
This
formidable
person
,
who
was
no
other
than
the
renowned
Figg
,
the
"
Atlas
of
the
sword
,
"
as
he
is
termed
by
Captain
Godfrey
,
had
removed
his
hat
and
"
skull
covering
,
"
and
was
wiping
the
heat
from
his
bepatched
and
close
-
shaven
pate
.
<EOS>
His
shirt
also
was
unbuttoned
,
and
disclosed
a
neck
like
that
of
an
ox
,
and
a
chest
which
might
have
served
as
a
model
for
a
Hercules
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
flattish
,
perhaps
,
it
should
be
called
,
a
_
flattened
_
nose
,
and
a
brown
,
leathern
-
looking
hide
<EOS>
,
that
seemed
as
if
it
had
not
unfrequently
undergone
the
process
of
tanning
.
<EOS>
Under
his
arm
he
carried
a
thick
,
knotted
crab
-
stick
.
<EOS>
The
above
description
of
    
--the
great
Figg
,
by
the
prize
-
fighting
swains
    
<EOS>
Sole
monarch
acknowledged
of
Mary'bone
plains--
 
may
sound
somewhat
tame
by
the
side
of
the
glowing
account
given
of
him
by
his
gallant
biographer
,
who
asserts
that
"
there
was
a
majesty
shone
in
his
countenance
,
and
blazed
in
his
actions
,
beyond
all
I
ever
saw
;
"
but
it
may
,
possibly
,
convey
a
more
accurate
notion
of
his
personal
appearance
.
<EOS>
James
Figg
was
the
most
perfect
master
of
self
-
defence
of
his
day
.
<EOS>
Seconded
by
his
strength
and
temper
,
his
skill
rendered
him
invincible
and
he
is
reputed
never
to
have
lost
a
battle
.
<EOS>
His
imperturbable
demeanour
in
the
fight
has
been
well
portrayed
by
Captain
Godfrey
,
who
here
condescends
to
lay
aside
his
stilts
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
right
leg
bold
and
firm
,
and
his
left
,
which
could
hardly
ever
be
disturbed
,
gave
him
a
surprising
advantage
,
and
struck
his
adversary
with
despair
and
panic
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
peculiar
way
of
stepping
in
,
in
a
parry
;
knew
his
arm
,
and
its
just
time
of
moving
;
put
a
firm
faith
in
that
,
and
never
let
his
opponent
escape
.
<EOS>
He
was
just
as
much
a
greater
master
than
any
other
I
ever
saw
,
as
he
was
a
greater
judge
of
time
and
measure
.

"
Figg
's
prowess
in
a
combat
with
Button
has
been
celebrated
by
Dr.
Byrom,--a
poet
of
whom
his
native
town
,
Manchester
,
may
be
justly
proud
;
and
his
features
and
figure
have
been
preserved
by
the
most
illustrious
of
his
companions
on
the
present
occasion,--Hogarth,--in
the
levée
in
the
"
Rake
's
Progress
,
"
and
in
"
Southwark
Fair
.
"
 
<EOS>
On
the
appearance
of
his
visitors
,
Sheppard
arose,--his
gyves
clanking
heavily
as
he
made
the
movement,--and
folding
his
arms
,
so
far
as
his
manacles
would
permit
him
,
upon
his
breast
,
steadily
returned
the
glances
fixed
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
noted
house
-
breaker
and
prison
-
breaker
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
Mr.
Pitt
,
pointing
to
the
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
"
Odd
's
life
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Gay
,
in
astonishment
;
"
is
this
slight
-
made
stripling
Jack
Sheppard
?
<EOS>
Why
,
I
expected
to
see
a
man
six
foot
high
at
the
least
,
and
as
broad
across
the
shoulders
as
our
friend
Figg
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
mere
boy
.
<EOS>
Are
you
sure
you
have
n't
mistaken
the
ward
,
Mr.
Pitt
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
mistake
,
Sir
,
"
rejoined
the
prisoner
,
drawing
himself
up
,
"
I
am
Jack
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
never
was
more
surprised
in
my
life
,
"
said
the
poet,--"never
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
just
the
man
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
_
expected
to
see
,
"
observed
Hogarth
,
who
,
having
arranged
everything
to
Thornhill
's
satisfaction
,
had
turned
to
look
at
the
prisoner
,
and
was
now
with
his
chin
upon
his
wrist
,
and
his
elbow
supported
by
the
other
hand
,
bending
his
keen
gray
eyes
upon
him
,
"
just
the
man
!
<EOS>
Look
at
that
light
,
lithe
<EOS>
figure,--all
muscle
and
activity
,
with
not
an
ounce
of
superfluous
flesh
upon
it
.
<EOS>
In
my
search
after
strange
characters
,
Mr.
Gay
,
I
've
been
in
many
odd
quarters
of
our
city
--
have
visited
haunts
frequented
only
by
thieves
--
the
Old
Mint
,
the
New
Mint
,
the
worst
part
of
St.
Giles
's
,
and
other
places
--
but
I
've
nowhere
seen
any
one
who
came
up
so
completely
to
my
notion
of
a
first
-
rate
housebreaker
as
the
individual
before
us
.
<EOS>
Wherever
I
saw
him
,
I
should
pick
him
out
as
a
man
designed
by
nature
to
plan
and
accomplish
the
wonderful
escapes
he
has
effected
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
a
smile
crossed
Sheppard
's
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
understands
me
,
you
perceive
,
"
said
Hogarth
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
wo
n't
dispute
your
judgment
in
such
matters
,
Mr.
Hogarth
,
"
replied
Gay
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
appeal
to
you
,
Sir
James
,
whether
it
is
n't
extraordinary
that
so
very
slight
<EOS>
a
person
should
be
such
a
desperate
robber
as
he
is
represented
--
so
young
,
too
,
for
such
an
_
old
_
offender
.
<EOS>
Why
,
he
can
scarcely
be
twenty
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
one
-
and
-
twenty
,
"
observed
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
One
-
and
-
twenty
,
ah
!
"
repeated
Gay
.
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
'm
not
far
from
the
mark
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
certainly
extremely
youthful
-
looking
and
very
slightly
made
,
"
said
Thornhill
,
who
had
been
attentively
studying
Sheppard
's
countenance
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
agree
with
Hogarth
,
that
he
is
precisely
the
person
to
do
what
he
has
done
.
<EOS>
Like
a
thorough
-
bred
racer
,
he
would
sustain
twice
as
much
fatigue
as
a
person
of
heavier
mould
.
<EOS>
Can
I
be
accommodated
with
a
seat
,
Mr.
Pitt
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
Sir
James
,
certainly
,
"
replied
the
governor
.
<EOS>
"
Get
a
chair
,
Austin
.
"
 
While
this
order
was
obeyed
,
Figg
,
who
had
been
standing
near
the
door
,
made
his
way
to
the
prisoner
,
and
offered
him
his
huge
hand
,
which
Jack
warmly
grasped
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Jack
,
"
said
the
prize
-
fighter
,
in
a
rough
,
but
friendly
voice
,
and
with
a
cut
-
and
-
thrust
abrupt
manner
peculiar
to
himself
;
"
how
are
you
,
lad
,
eh
?
<EOS>
Sorry
to
see
you
here
.
<EOS>
Would
n't
take
my
advice
.
<EOS>
Told
you
how
it
would
be
.
<EOS>
One
mistress
enough
to
ruin
a
man,--two
,
the
devil

<EOS>
Laughed
at
me
,
then
.
<EOS>
Laugh
on
the
wrong
side
of
your
mouth
,
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
not
come
here
to
insult
me
,
Mr.
Figg
?
"
said
Jack
,
peevishly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Insult
you
!
<EOS>
not
I
;
"
returned
Figg
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Heard
of
your
escapes
.
<EOS>
Everybody
talking
of
you

<EOS>
Wished

"
<EOS>
he
added
,
slipping
a
few
gold
pieces
into
Jack
's
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
kind
,
"
said
Jack
,
returning
the
money
;
"
but
I
do
n't
require
assistance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Too
proud
,
eh

"
rejoined
the
prize
-
fighter
.
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
be
under
an
obligation
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
you
're
wrong

Mr.
Figg
,
"
replied
Jack
,
smiling
;
"
for
,
before
I
'm
taken
to
Tyburn
,
I
mean
to
borrow
a
shirt

the
occasion
from
you

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Have
it
,
and
welcome

"
rejoined
Figg
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Always
plenty
to
spare

<EOS>
Never
bought
a
shirt
in
my
life

Mr.
Gay

"
he
added
,
turning
to
the
poet
.
"
<EOS>
Sold
a
good
many
,
though
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
manage
that
,
Mr.
Figg
?
"
asked
Gay
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thus
,
"
replied
the
prize
-
fighter
.
<EOS>
"

'
"
 
<EOS>
"
An
ingenious
device
,
"
laughed
Gay
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
James
Thornhill
's
preparations
being
completed
,
Mr.
Pitt
desired
to
know
if
he
wanted
anything
further
,
and
being
answered
in
the
negative
,
he
excused
himself
on
the
plea
that
his
attendance
was
required
in
the
court
at
the
Old
Bailey
,
which
was
then
sitting
,
and
withdrew
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
me
the
favour
to
seat
yourself
,
Jack
,
"
said
Sir
James
.
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
a
little
further
off
,
if
you
please
.
"
 
Sheppard
immediately
complied
with
the
painter
's
request
;
while
Gay
and
Figg
drew
back
on
one
side
,
and
Hogarth
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
The
latter
took
from
his
pocket
a
small
note
-
book
and
pencil
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
make
a
sketch
,
too
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Jack
Sheppard
's
face
is
well
worth
preserving
.
<EOS>
"
 
After
narrowly
examining
the
countenance
of
the
sitter
,
and
motioning
him
with
his
pencil
into
a
particular
attitude
,
Sir
James
Thornhill
commenced
operations
;
and
,
while
he
rapidly
transferred
his
lineaments
to
the
canvass
,
engaged
him
in
conversation
,
in
the
course
of
which
he
artfully
contrived
to
draw
him
into
a
recital
of
his
adventures
.
<EOS>
The
_
ruse
_
succeeded
almost
beyond
his
expectation
.
<EOS>
During
the
narration
Jack
's
features
lighted
up
,
and
an
expression
,
which
would
have
been
in
vain
looked
for
in
repose
,
was
instantly
caught
and
depicted
by
the
skilful
artist
.
<EOS>
All
the
party
were
greatly
interested
by
Sheppard
's
history
--
especially
Figg
,
who
laughed
loud
and
long
at
the
escape
from
the
Condemned
Hold
.
<EOS>
When
Jack
came
to
speak
of
Jonathan
Wild
,
his
countenance
fell
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
must
change
the
subject
,
"
remarked
Thornhill
,
pausing
in
his
task
;
"
this
will
never
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Quite
right
,
Sir
James
,
"
said
Austin
.
<EOS>
"
We
never
suffer
him
to
mention
Mr.
Wild
's
name
.
<EOS>
He
never
appears
to
so
little
advantage
as
when
speaking
of
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
wonder
at
it
,
"
rejoined
Gay
.
 
<EOS>
Here
Hogarth
received
a
private
signal
from
Thornhill
to
attract
Sheppard
's
attention
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
so
you
've
given
up
all
hope
of
escaping
,
eh
,
Jack
?
"
remarked
Hogarth
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
scarcely
a
fair
question
,
Mr.
Hogarth
,
before
the
jailer
,
"
replied
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
tell
you
frankly
,
and
Mr.
Austin
,
may
repeat
it
if
he
pleases
to
his
master
,
Jonathan
Wild,--I
have
_
not
_
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
said
,
Jack
,
"
cried
Figg
.
<EOS>
"
Never
give
in
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
observed
Hogarth
,
"
if
,
fettered
as
you
are
,
you
contrive
to
break
out
of
this
dungeon
<EOS>
,
you
'll
do
what
no
man
ever
did
before
.
"
 
<EOS>
A
peculiar
smile
illuminated
Jack
's
features
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
it
is
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Sir
James
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
the
exact
expression
I
want
.
<EOS>
For
the
love
of
Heaven
,
Jack
,
do
n't
move!--Don't
alter
a
muscle
,
if
you
can
help
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
with
a
few
magical
touches
,
he
stamped
the
fleeting
expression
on
the
canvass
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
it
too
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Hogarth
,
busily
plying
his
pencil
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Gad
!
<EOS>
it
's
a
devilish
fine
face
when
lit
up
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
As
like
as
life
,
Sir
,
"
observed
Austin
,
peeping
over
Thornhill
's
shoulder
at
the
portrait
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
like
as
life
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
very
face
,
"
exclaimed
Gay
,
advancing
to
look
at
it;--"with
all
the
escapes
written
in
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
flatter
me
,
"
smiled
Sir
James
.
<EOS>
"
But
,
I
own
,
I
think
it
_
is
_
like
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
of
_
<EOS>
my
_
sketch
,
Jack
?
"
said
Hogarth
,
handing
him
the
drawing
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
like
enough
,
I
dare
say
,
"
rejoined
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
wants
something
_
here
_
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
pointed
significantly
to
the
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
,
"
rejoined
Hogarth
,
rapidly
sketching
a
file
,
which
he
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
picture
.
<EOS>
"
Will
that
do
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
returning
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
better
,
"
observed
Sheppard
,
meaningly
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
've
given
me
what
I
do
n't
possess
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hum
!
<EOS>
"
said
Hogarth
,
looking
fixedly
at
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
how
I
can
improve
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
May
I
look
at
it
,
Sir
!
"
said
Austin
,
stepping
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Hogarth
,
hastily
effacing
the
sketch
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
never
satisfied
with
a
first
attempt
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Egad
,
Jack
,
"
said
Gay
,
"
you
should
write
your
adventures
.
<EOS>
They
would
be
quite
as
entertaining
as
the
histories
of
Guzman
D'Alfarache
,
Lazarillo
de
Tormes
,
Estevanillo
Gonzalez
,
Meriton
Latroon
,
or
any
of
my
favourite
<EOS>
rogues,--and
<EOS>
far
more
instructive
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
write
them
for
me
,
Mr.
Gay
,
"
rejoined
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
'll
write
them
,
I
'll
illustrate
them
,
"
observed
Hogarth
.
 
<EOS>
"
An
idea
has
just
occurred
to
me
,
"
said
Gay
,
"
which
Jack
's
narrative
has
suggested
.
<EOS>
I
'll
write
an
opera
the
scene
of
which
shall
be
laid
altogether
in
Newgate
,
and
the
principal
character
shall
be
a
highmaywan
.
<EOS>
I
'll
not
forget
your
two
mistresses
,
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nor
Jonathan
Wild
,
I
hope
,
"
interposed
Sheppard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
,
"
replied
Gay
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
gibbet
the
rascal
.
<EOS>
But
I
forget
,
"
he
added
,
glancing
at
Austin
;
"
it
's
high
treason
to
speak
disrespectfully
of
Mr.
Wild
in
his
own
domain
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hear
nothing
,
Sir
,
"
laughed
Austin
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
about
to
add
,
"
continued
Gay
,
"
that
my
opera
shall
have
no
music
except
the
good
old
ballad
tunes
.
<EOS>
And
we
'll
see
whether
it
wo
n't
put
the
Italian
opera
out
of
fashion
,
with
Cutzoni
,
Senesino
,
and
the
'
divine
'
Farinelli
at
its
head
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
'll
do
a
national
service
,
then
,
"
said
Hogarth
.
<EOS>
"
The
sums
lavished
upon
those
people
are
perfectly
disgraceful
,
and
I
should
be
enchanted
to
see
them
hooted
from
the
stage
.
<EOS>
But
I
've
an
idea
as
well
as
you
,
grounded
in
some
measure
upon
Sheppard
's
story
.
<EOS>
I
'll
take
two
apprentices
,
and
depict
their
career
.
<EOS>
One
,
by
perseverance
and
industry
shall
obtain
fortune
,
credit
,
and
the
highest
honours
;
while
the
other
by
an
opposite
course
,
and
dissolute
habits
,
shall
eventually
arrive
at
Tyburn
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
's
will
be
nearer
the
truth
,
and
have
a
deeper
moral
,
Mr.
Hogarth
,
"
remarked
Jack
,
dejectedly
.
"
<EOS>
But
if
my
career
were
truly
exhibited
,
it
must
be
as
one
long
struggle
against
destiny
in
the
shape
of--
"
 
"
Jonathan
Wild
,
"
interposed
Gay
.
<EOS>
"
I
knew
it
.
<EOS>
By
the
by
,
Mr.
Hogarth
,
did
n't
I
see
you
last
night
at
the
ridotto
with
Lady
Thornhill
and
her
pretty
daughter
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Me!--no
,
Sir
,
"
stammered
Hogarth
,
colouring
.
<EOS>
And
he
hazarded
a
wink
at
the
poet
over
the
paper
on
which
he
was
sketching
.
<EOS>
Luckily
,
Sir
James
was
so
much
engrossed
by
his
own
task
,
that
both
the
remark
and
gesture
escaped
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
was
mistaken
,
"
returned
Gay
.
<EOS>
"
You
've
been
quizzing
my
friend
Kent
<EOS>
,
I
perceive
,
in
your
Burlington
Gate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
capital
caricature
that
,
"
remarked
Thornhill
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
What
does
Mr.
Kent
say
to
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
thinks
so
highly
of
it
,
that
he
says
if
he
had
a
daughter
he
would
give
her
to
the
artist
,
"
answered
Gay
,
a
little
maliciously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Sir
James
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Sdeath
!
"
cried
Hogarth
,
aside
to
the
poet
.
<EOS>
"
You
've
ruined
my
hopes
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Advanced
them
rather
,
"
replied
Gay
,
in
the
same
tone
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Thornhill
's
a
charming
girl
.
<EOS>
_
I
_
think
a
wife
a
needless
incumbrance
,
and
mean
to
die
a
bachelor
.
<EOS>
But
,
if
I
were
in
your
place
,
I
know
what
I
'd
do--
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
--
what
would
you
do
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Hogarth
,
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Run
away
with
her
,
"
replied
Gay
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pish
!
"
exclaimed
Hogarth
.
<EOS>
But
he
afterwards
acted
upon
the
suggestion
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
-
b'ye
,
Jack
,
"
said
Figg
,
putting
on
his
hat
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Rather
in
the
way
.
<EOS>
Send
you
the
shirt
.
<EOS>
Here
,
turnkey
.
<EOS>
Couple
of
guineas
to
drink
Captain
Sheppard
's
speedy
escape

<EOS>
Thank
him
,
not
me
,
man
.
<EOS>
Give
this
fellow
the
slip
,
if
you
can
,
Jack
.
<EOS>
If
not
,
keep
up
your
spirits
.
<EOS>
Die
game

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
fear
,
"
replied
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
get
free
,
I
'll
have
a
bout
with
you
at
all
weapons
.
<EOS>
If
not
,
I
'll
take
a
cheerful
glass
with
you
at
the
City

on
my

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Give
you
the
best
I
have
in
either
case

"
replied
Figg
.
<EOS>
"
Good
-
b'ye
!
"
<EOS>
And
with
a
cordial
shake
of
the
hand
he
took
his
departure
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
James
Thornhill
,
then
,
rose
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
trouble
you
further
,
Jack
,
"
he
remarked
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
done
all
I
can
to
the
portrait
here
.
<EOS>
I
must
finish
it
at
home

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Permit
me
to
see
it
,
Sir
James
!
"
requested
Jack
.
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
as
the
painting
was
turned
towards
him
.
"
<EOS>
What
would
my
poor
mother
say
to
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
sorry
to
see
that
about
your
mother
,
Jack
,
"
observed
Hogarth
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
of
her
?
"
exclaimed
Jack
,
starting
up
.
<EOS>
"
Is
she
dead
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
--
no
,
"
answered
Hogarth
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
alarm
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
saw
it
this
morning
in
the
Daily
Journal
--
an
advertisement
,
offering
a
reward--
"
 
"
A
reward
!
"
echoed
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
what
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
had
the
paper
with
me
.
'
<EOS>
Sdeath
!
<EOS>
what
can
I
have
done
with
it
?
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
here
it
is
,
"
cried
Hogarth
,
picking
it
from
the
ground
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
have
dropped
it
when
I
took
out
my
note
-
book
.
<EOS>
There
's
the
paragraph
.
'
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Mrs
.
Sheppard
left
Mr.
Wood
's
house
at
Dollis
Hill
on
Tuesday_'--that
's
two
days
ago,--'_hasn't
been
heard
of

_
.
'
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
,
"
cried
Jack
,
snatching
the
paper
,
and
eagerly
perusing
the
advertisement
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
in
a
tone
of
anguish
.
"
<EOS>
She
has
fallen
into
the
villain
's
hands
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
villain
?
"
cried
Hogarth
.
 
<EOS>
"
Jonathan
Wild
,
I
'll
be
sworn
,
"
said
Gay
.
 
<EOS>
"
Right!--right
!
"
cried
Jack
,
striking
his
fettered
hands
against
his
breast
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
in
his
power
,
and
I
am
here
,
chained
hand
and
foot
,
unable
to
assist
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
make
a
fine
sketch
of
him
now
,
"
whispered
Hogarth
to
Gay
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
how
it
was
,
Sir
James
,
"
said
Austin
,
addressing
the
knight
,
who
was
preparing
for
his
departure
,
"
he
attributes
every
misfortune
that
befals
him
to
Mr.
Wild
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
with
some
justice
,
"
replied
Thornhill
,
drily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Allow
me
to
assist
you
,
Sir
James
,
"
said
Hogarth
.
 
<EOS>
"
Many
thanks
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Thornhill
,
with
freezing
politeness
;
"
but
I
d
not
require
assistance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
what
,
Jack
,
"
said
Gay
,
"
<EOS>
I
've
several
urgent
engagements
this
morning
;
but
I
'll
return
to
-
morrow
,
and
hear
the
rest
of
your
story
.
<EOS>
And
,
if
I
can
render
you
any
service
,
you
may
command
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
To
-
morrow
will
be
too
late
,
"
said
Sheppard
,
moodily
.
 
<EOS>
The
easel
and
palette
having
been
packed
up
,
and
the
canvass
carefully
removed
by
Austin
,
the
party
took
leave
of
the
prisoner
,
who
was
so
much
abstracted
that
he
scarcely
noticed
their
departure
.
<EOS>
Just
as
Hogarth
got
to
the
door
,
the
turnkey
stopped
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
forgotten
your
knife
,
Mr.
Hogarth
,
"
he
observed
,
significantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
I
have
,
"
replied
Hogarth
,
glancing
at
Sheppard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
do
without
it
,
"
muttered
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
The
door
was
then
locked
,
and
he
was
left
alone
.
 
<EOS>
At
three
o'clock
,
on
the
same
day
,
Austin
brought
up
Jack
's
provisions
,
and
,
after
carefully
examining
his
fetters
,
and
finding
all
secure
,
told
him
if
he
wanted
anything
further
he
must
mention
it
,
as
he
should
not
be
able
to
return
in
the
evening
,
his
presence
being
required
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
Jack
replied
in
the
negative
,
and
it
required
all
his
mastery
over
himself
to
prevent
the
satisfaction
which
this
announcement
afforded
him
from
being
noticed
by
the
jailer
.
 
<EOS>
With
the
usual
precautions
,
Austin
then
departed
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
"
cried
Jack
,
leaping
up
,
"
for
an
achievement
,
compared
with
which
all
I
have
yet
done
shall
be
as
nothing
!

CHAPTER
XVII
.
 
<EOS>
The
Iron
Bar
.
  
<EOS>
Jack
Sheppard
's
first
object
was
to
free
himself
from
his
handcuffs
.
<EOS>
This
he
accomplished
by
holding
the
chain
that
connected
them
firmly
between
his
teeth
,
and
squeezing
his
fingers
as
closely
together
as
possible
,
succeeded
in
drawing
his
wrists
through
the
manacles
.
<EOS>
He
next
twisted
the
heavy
gyves
round
and
round
,
and
partly
by
main
strength
,
partly
by
a
dexterous
and
well
-
applied
jerk
,
sapped
asunder
the
central
link
by
which
they
were
attached
to
the
padlock
.
<EOS>
Taking
off
his
stockings
,
he
then
drew
up
the
basils
as
far
as
he
was
able
,
and
tied
the
fragments
of
the
broken
chain
to
his
legs
,
to
prevent
them
from
clanking
,
and
impeding
his
future
exertions
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
's
former
attempt
to
pass
up
the
chimney
,
it
may
be
remembered
,
was
obstructed
by
an
iron
bar
.
<EOS>
To
remove
this
obstacle
it
was
necessary
make
an
extensive
breach
in
the
wall
.
<EOS>
With
the
broken
links
of
the
chain
,
which
served
him
in
lieu
of
more
efficient
implements
,
he
commenced
operations
just
above
the
chimney
-
piece
,
and
soon
contrived
to
pick
a
hole
in
the
plaster
.
 
<EOS>
He
found
the
wall
,
as
he
suspected
,
solidly
constructed
of
brick
and
stone
;
and
with
the
slight
and
inadequate
tools
which
he
possessed
,
it
was
a
work
of
infinite
labour
and
skill
to
get
out
a
single
brick
.
<EOS>
That
done
,
however
,
he
was
well
aware
the
rest
would
be
comparatively
easy
,
and
as
he
threw
the
brick
to
the
ground
,
he
exclaimed
triumphantly
,
"
The
first
step
is
taken
--
the
main
difficulty
is
overcome
.
"
 
<EOS>
Animated
by
this
trifling
success
,
he
proceeded
with
fresh
ardour
,
and
the
rapidity
of
his
progress
was
proclaimed
by
the
heap
of
bricks
,
stones
,
and
mortar
which
before
long
covered
the
floor
.
<EOS>
At
the
expiration
of
an
hour
,
by
dint
of
unremitting
exertion
,
he
had
made
so
large
a
breach
in
the
chimney
,
that
he
could
stand
upright
in
it
.
<EOS>
He
was
now
within
a
foot
of
the
bar
,
and
introducing
himself
into
the
hole
,
speedily
worked
his
way
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
Regardless
of
the
risk
he
incurred
from
some
heavy
stone
dropping
on
his
head
or
feet,--regardless
also
of
the
noise
made
by
the
falling
rubbish
,
and
of
the
imminent
danger
which
he
consequently
ran
of
being
interrupted
by
some
of
the
jailers
,
should
the
sound
reach
their
ears
,
he
continued
to
pull
down
large
masses
of
the
wall
,
which
he
flung
upon
the
floor
of
the
cell
.
 
<EOS>
Having
worked
thus
for
another
quarter
of
an
hour
without
being
sensible
of
fatigue
,
though
he
was
half
stifled
by
the
clouds
of
dust
which
his
exertions
raised
,
he
had
made
a
hole
about
three
feet
wide
,
and
six
high
,
and
uncovered
the
iron
bar
.
<EOS>
Grasping
it
firmly
with
both
hands
,
he
quickly
wrenched
if
from
the
stones
in
which
it
was
mortised
,
and
leapt
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
On
examination
it
proved
to
be
a
flat
bar
of
iron
,
nearly
a
yard
in
length
,
and
more
than
an
inch
square
.
"
<EOS>
A
capital
instrument
for
my
purpose
<EOS>
,
"
thought
Jack
,
shouldering
it
,
"
and
worth
all
the
trouble
I
have
had
in
procuring
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
While
he
was
thus
musing
,
he
fancied
he
heard
the
lock
tried
.
<EOS>
A
chill
ran
through
his
frame
,
and
,
grasping
the
heavy
weapon
with
which
chance
had
provided
him
,
prepared
to
strike
down
the
first
person
who
should
enter
the
cell
.
<EOS>
After
listening
attentively
for
a
short
time
without
drawing
breath
,
he
became
convinced
that
his
apprehensions
were
groundless
,
and
,
greatly
relieved
,
sat
down
upon
the
chair
to
rest
himself
and
prepare
for
further
efforts
.
 
<EOS>
Acquainted
with
every
part
of
the
jail
,
Jack
well
knew
that
his
only
chance
of
effecting
an
escape
must
be
by
the
roof
.
<EOS>
To
reach
it
would
be
a
most
difficult
undertaking
.
<EOS>
Still
it
was
possible
,
and
the
difficulty
was
only
a
fresh
incitement
.
 
<EOS>
The
mere
enumeration
of
the
obstacles
that
existed
would
have
deterred
any
spirit
less
daring
than
Sheppard
's
from
even
hazarding
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
Independently
of
other
risks
,
and
of
the
chance
of
breaking
his
neck
in
the
descent
,
he
was
aware
that
to
reach
the
leads
he
should
have
to
break
open
six
of
the
strongest
doors
of
the
prison
.
<EOS>
Armed
,
however
,
with
the
implement
he
had
so
fortunately
obtained
,
he
did
not
despair
of
success
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
name
will
only
be
remembered
as
that
of
a
robber
,
"
he
mused
;
"
but
it
shall
be
remembered
as
that
of
a
bold
one
:
and
<EOS>
this
night
's
achievement
,
if
it
does
nothing
else
,
shall
prevent
me
from
being
classed
with
the
common
herd
of
depredators
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Roused
by
this
reflection
,
filled
with
the
deepest
anxiety
for
his
mother
,
and
burning
to
be
avenged
upon
Jonathan
Wild
,
he
grasped
the
iron
bar
,
which
,
when
he
sat
down
,
he
had
laid
upon
his
knees
,
and
stepped
quickly
across
the
room
.
<EOS>
In
doing
so
,
he
had
to
clamber
up
the
immense
heap
of
bricks
and
rubbish
which
now
littered
the
floor
,
amounting
almost
to
a
car
-
load
,
and
reaching
up
nearly
to
the
top
of
the
chimney
-
piece
.
 
<EOS>
"
Austin
will
stare
,
"
thought
Jack
,
"
when
he
comes
here
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
It
will
cost
them
something
to
repair
their
stronghold
,
and
take
them
more
time
to
build
it
up
again
than
I
have
taken
to
pull
it
down
.
"
 
<EOS>
Before
proceeding
with
his
task
,
he
considered
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
barricade
the
door
;
but
,
reflecting
that
the
bar
would
be
an
indispensable
assistant
in
his
further
efforts
,
he
abandoned
the
idea
,
and
determined
to
rely
implicitly
on
that
good
fortune
which
had
hitherto
attended
him
on
similar
occasions
.
 
<EOS>
Having
once
more
got
into
the
chimney
,
he
climbed
to
a
level
with
the
ward
above
,
and
recommenced
operations
as
vigorously
as
before
.
<EOS>
He
was
now
aided
with
a
powerful
implement
,
with
which
he
soon
contrived
to
make
a
hole
in
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
"
Every
brick
I
take
out
,
"
cried
Jack
,
as
fresh
rubbish
clattered
down
the
chimney
,
"
brings
me
nearer
my
mother
.

CHAPTER
XVIII

<EOS>
The
Red
Room
.
  
<EOS>
The
ward
into
which
Jack
was
endeavouring
to
break
was
called
the
Red
Room
,
from
the
circumstance
of
its
walls
having
once
been
painted
in
that
colour
;
all
traces
of
which
had
,
however
,
long
since
disappeared
.
<EOS>
Like
the
Castle
,
which
it
resembled
in
all
respects
except
that
it
was
destitute
even
of
a
barrack
-
bedstead
,
the
Red
Room
was
reserved
for
state
-
prisoners
,
and
had
not
been
occupied
since
the
year
1716
,
when
the
jail
,
as
has
before
been
mentioned
,
was
crowded
by
the
Preston
rebels
.
 
<EOS>
Having
made
a
hole
in
the
wall
sufficiently
large
to
pass
through
,
Jack
first
tossed
the
bar
into
the
room
and
then
crept
after
it
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
had
gained
his
feet
,
he
glanced
round
the
bare
blank
walls
of
the
cell
,
and
,
oppressed
by
the
musty
,
close
atmosphere
,
exclaimed
,
<EOS>
"
I
'll
let
a
little
fresh
air
into
this
dungeon
.
<EOS>
They
say
it
has
n't
been
opened
for
eight
years
--
but
I
wo
n't
be
eight
years
in
getting
out
of
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
In
stepping
across
the
room
,
some
sharp
point
in
the
floor
pierced
his
foot
,
and
stooping
to
examine
it
<EOS>
,
he
found
that
the
wound
had
been
inflicted
by
a
long
rusty
nail
,
which
projected
from
the
boards
.
<EOS>
Totally
disregarding
the
pain
,
he
picked
up
the
nail
,
and
reserved
it
for
future
use
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
he
long
in
making
it
available
.
 
<EOS>
On
examining
the
door
,
he
found
it
secured
by
a
large
rusty
lock
,
which
he
endeavoured
to
pick
with
the
nail
he
had
just
acquired
;
but
all
his
efforts
proving
ineffectual
,
he
removed
the
plate
that
covered
it
with
the
bar
,
and
with
his
fingers
contrived
to
draw
back
the
bolt
.
 
<EOS>
Opening
the
door
he
then
stepped
into
a
dark
narrow
passage
leading
,
as
he
was
well
aware
,
to
the
chapel
.
<EOS>
On
the
left
there
were
doors
communicating
with
the
King
's
Bench
Ward
and
the
Stone
Ward
,
two
large
holds
on
the
Master
Debtors
'
side
.
<EOS>
But
Jack
was
too
well
versed
in
the
geography
of
the
place
to
attempt
either
of
them
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
if
he
had
been
ignorant
of
it
,
the
sound
of
voices
which
he
could
faintly
distinguish
,
would
have
served
as
a
caution
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Hurrying
on
,
his
progress
was
soon
checked
by
a
strong
door
,
several
inches
in
thickness
,
and
nearly
as
wide
as
the
passage
.
<EOS>
Running
his
hand
carefully
over
it
in
search
of
the
lock
,
he
perceived
to
his
dismay
that
it
was
fastened
on
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
After
several
vain
attempts
to
burst
it
open
,
he
resolved
,
as
a
last
alternative
,
to
break
through
the
wall
in
the
part
nearest
to
the
lock
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
much
more
serious
task
than
he
anticipated
.
<EOS>
The
wall
was
of
considerable
thickness
,
and
built
altogether
of
stone
;
and
the
noise
he
was
compelled
to
make
in
using
the
heavy
bar
,
which
brought
sparks
with
every
splinter
he
struck
off
,
was
so
great
,
that
he
feared
it
must
be
heard
by
the
prisoners
on
the
Debtors
'
side
.
<EOS>
Heedless
,
however
,
of
the
consequences
,
he
pursued
his
task
.
 
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
's
labour
,
during
which
he
was
obliged
more
than
once
to
pause
to
regain
breath
,
sufficed
to
make
a
hole
wide
enough
to
allow
a
passage
for
his
arm
up
to
the
elbow
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
he
was
able
to
force
back
a
ponderous
bolt
from
its
socket
;
and
to
his
unspeakable
joy
,
found
that
the
door
instantly
yielded
.
 
<EOS>
Once
more
cheered
by
daylight
,
he
hastened
forward
,
and
entered
the
chapel
.
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XIX
.
 
<EOS>
The
Chapel
.
  
<EOS>
Situated
at
the
upper
part
of
the
south
-
east
angle
of
the
jail
,
the
chapel
of
Old
Newgate
was
divided
on
the
north
side
into
three
grated
compartments
,
or
pens
as
they
were
termed
,
allotted
to
the
common
debtors
and
felons
.
<EOS>
In
the
north
-
west
angle
,
there
was
a
small
pen
for
female
offenders
,
and
,
on
the
south
,
a
more
commodious
enclosure
appropriated
to
the
master
-
debtors
and
strangers
.
<EOS>
Immediately
beneath
the
pulpit
stood
a
large
circular
pew
where
malefactors
under
sentence
of
death
sat
to
hear
the
condemned
sermon
delivered
to
them
,
and
where
they
formed
a
public
spectacle
to
the
crowds
,
which
curiosity
generally
attracted
on
those
occasions
.
 
<EOS>
To
return
.
<EOS>
Jack
had
got
into
one
of
the
pens
at
the
north
side
of
the
chapel
.
<EOS>
The
enclosure
by
which
it
was
surrounded
was
about
twelve
feet
high
;
the
under
part
being
composed
of
taken
planks
,
the
upper
of
a
strong
iron
grating
,
surmounted
by
sharp
iron
spikes
.
<EOS>
In
the
middle
there
was
a
gate
.
<EOS>
It
was
locked
.
<EOS>
But
Jack
speedily
burst
it
open
with
the
iron
bar
.
 
<EOS>
Clearing
the
few
impediments
in
his
way
,
he
soon
reached
the
condemned
pew
,
where
it
had
once
been
his
fate
to
sit
;
and
extending
himself
on
the
seat
endeavoured
to
snatch
a
moment
's
repose
.
<EOS>
It
was
denied
him
,
for
as
he
closed
his
eyes
--
though
but
for
an
instant
--
the
whole
scene
of
his
former
visit
to
the
place
rose
before
him
.
<EOS>
There
he
sat
as
before
,
with
the
heavy
fetters
on
his
limbs
,
and
beside
him
sat
his
three
companions
,
who
had
since
expiated
their
offences
on
the
gibbet
.
<EOS>
The
chapel
was
again
crowded
with
visitors
,
and
every
eye
--
even
that
of
Jonathan
Wild
who
had
come
thither
to
deride
him,--was
fixed
upon
him
.
<EOS>
So
perfect
was
the
illusion
,
that
he
could
almost
fancy
<EOS>
he
heard
the
solemn
voice
of
the
ordinary
warning
him
that
his
race
was
nearly
run
,
and
imploring
him
to
prepare
for
eternity
.
<EOS>
From
this
perturbed
state
he
was
roused
by
thoughts
of
his
mother
,
and
fancying
he
heard
her
gentle
voice
urging
him
on
to
fresh
exertion
,
he
started
up
.
 
<EOS>
On
one
side
of
the
chapel
there
was
a
large
grated
window
,
but
,
as
it
looked
upon
the
interior
of
the
jail
,
Jack
preferred
following
the
course
he
had
originally
decided
upon
to
making
any
attempt
in
this
quarter
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
he
proceeded
to
a
gate
which
stood
upon
the
south
,
and
guarded
the
passage
communicating
with
the
leads
.
<EOS>
It
was
grated
and
crested
with
spikes
,
like
that
he
had
just
burst
open
,
and
thinking
it
a
needless
waste
of
time
to
force
it
,
he
broke
off
one
of
the
spikes
,
which
he
carried
with
him
for
further
purposes
,
and
then
climbed
over
it
.
 
<EOS>
A
short
flight
of
steps
brought
him
to
a
dark
passage
,
into
which
he
plunged
.
<EOS>
Here
he
found
another
strong
door
,
making
the
fifth
he
had
encountered
.
<EOS>
Well
aware
that
the
doors
in
this
passage
were
much
stronger
than
those
in
the
entry
he
had
just
quitted
he
was
neither
surprised
nor
dismayed
to
find
it
fastened
by
a
lock
of
unusual
size
.
<EOS>
After
repeatedly
trying
to
remove
the
plate
,
which
was
so
firmly
screwed
down
that
it
resisted
all
his
efforts
,
and
vainly
attempting
to
pick
it
with
the
spike
and
nail
;
he
,
at
length
,
after
half
an
hour
's
ineffectual
labour
,
wrenched
off
the
box
by
means
of
the
iron
bar
,
and
the
door
,
as
he
laughingly
expressed
it
,
"
became
his
humble
servant
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
this
difficulty
was
only
overcome
to
be
succeeded
by
one
still
greater
.
<EOS>
Hastening
along
the
passage
he
came
to
the
sixth
door
.
<EOS>
For
this
he
was
prepared
;
but
he
was
not
prepared
for
the
almost
insurmountable
obstacles
which
it
presented
.
<EOS>
Running
his
hand
hastily
over
it
,
he
was
startled
to
find
it
one
complicated
mass
of
bolts
and
bars
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
if
all
the
precautions
previously
taken
were
here
accumulated
.
<EOS>
Any
one
less
courageous
than
himself
would
have
abandoned
the
attempt
from
a
conviction
of
its
utter
hopelessness
;
but
,
though
it
might
for
a
moment
damp
his
ardour
,
it
could
not
deter
him
.
 
<EOS>
Once
again
,
he
passed
his
hand
over
the
surface
and
carefully
noted
all
the
obstacles
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
lock
,
apparently
more
than
a
foot
wide
,
strongly
plated
,
and
girded
to
the
door
with
thick
iron
hoops
.
<EOS>
Below
it
a
prodigiously
large
bolt
was
shot
into
the
socket
,
and
,
in
order
to
keep
it
there
,
was
fastened
by
a
hasp
,
and
further
protected
by
an
immense
padlock
.
<EOS>
Besides
this
,
the
door
was
crossed
and
recrossed
by
iron
bars
,
clenched
by
broad
-
headed
nails
.
<EOS>
An
iron
fillet
secured
the
socket
of
the
bolt
and
the
box
of
the
lock
to
the
main
post
of
the
doorway
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
disheartened
by
this
survey
,
Jack
set
to
work
upon
the
lock
,
which
he
attacked
with
all
his
implements;--now
attempting
to
pick
it
with
the
nail;--now
to
wrench
it
off
with
the
bar
:
but
all
without
effect
.
<EOS>
He
not
only
failed
in
making
any
impression
,
but
seemed
to
increase
the
difficulties
,
for
after
an
hour
's
toil
he
had
broken
the
nail
and
slightly
bent
the
iron
bar
.
 
<EOS>
Completely
overcome
by
fatigue
,
with
strained
muscles
,
and
bruised
hands
;
streaming
with
perspiration
,
and
with
lips
so
parched
that
he
would
gladly
have
parted
with
a
treasure
if
he
had
possessed
it
for
a
draught
of
water
;
he
sank
against
the
wall
,
and
while
in
this
state
was
seized
with
,
a
sudden
and
strange
alarm
.
<EOS>
He
fancied
that
the
turnkeys
had
discovered
his
flight
and
were
in
pursuit
of
him,--that
<EOS>
they
had
climbed
up
the
chimney,--entered
<EOS>
the
Red
Room,--tracked
him
from
door
to
door
,
and
were
now
only
detained
by
the
gate
which
he
had
left
unbroken
in
the
chapel
.
<EOS>
He
even
thought
he
could
detect
the
voice
of
Jonathan
,
urging
and
directing
them
.
 
<EOS>
So
strongly
was
he
impressed
with
this
idea
,
that
grasping
the
iron
bar
with
both
hands
,
he
dashed
it
furiously
against
the
door
,
making
the
passage
echo
with
the
blows
.
 
<EOS>
By
degrees
,
his
fears
vanished
,
and
hearing
nothing
,
he
grew
calmer
.
<EOS>
His
spirits
revived
,
and
encouraging
himself
with
the
idea
that
the
present
impediment
,
though
the
greatest
,
was
the
last
,
he
set
himself
seriously
to
consider
how
it
might
best
be
overcome
.
 
<EOS>
On
reflection
,
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
,
perhaps
,
be
able
to
loosen
the
iron
fillet
;
a
notion
no
sooner
conceived
than
executed
.
<EOS>
With
incredible
labour
,
and
by
the
aid
of
both
spike
and
nail
,
he
succeeded
in
getting
the
point
of
the
bar
beneath
the
fillet
.
<EOS>
Exerting
all
his
energies
,
and
using
the
bar
as
a
lever
,
he
forced
off
the
iron
band
,
which
was
full
seven
feet
high
,
seven
inches
wide
,
and
two
thick
,
and
which
brought
with
it
in
its
fall
the
box
of
the
lock
and
the
socket
of
the
bolt
,
leaving
no
further
hinderance
.
 
<EOS>
Overjoyed
beyond
measure
at
having
vanquished
this
apparently
-
insurmountable
obstacle
,
Jack
darted
through
the
door
.
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XX
.
 
<EOS>
The
Leads
.
  
<EOS>
Ascending
a
short
flight
of
steps
,
Jack
found
at
the
summit
a
door
,
which
being
bolted
in
the
inside
he
speedily
opened
.
 
<EOS>
The
fresh
air
,
which
blew
in
his
face
,
greatly
revived
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
now
reached
what
was
called
the
Lower
Leads,--a
flat
,
covering
a
part
of
the
prison
contiguous
to
the
gateway
,
and
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
walls
about
fourteen
feet
high
.
<EOS>
On
the
north
stood
the
battlements
of
one
of
the
towers
of
the
gate
.
<EOS>
On
this
side
a
flight
of
wooden
steps
,
protected
by
a
hand
-
rail
,
led
to
a
door
opening
upon
the
summit
of
the
prison
.
<EOS>
This
door
was
crested
with
spikes
,
and
guarded
on
the
right
by
a
bristling
semicircle
of
spikes
.
<EOS>
Hastily
ascending
these
steps
,
Jack
found
the
door
,
as
he
anticipated
,
locked
.
<EOS>
He
could
have
easily
forced
it
,
but
preferred
a
more
expeditious
mode
of
reaching
the
roof
which
suggested
itself
to
him
.
<EOS>
Mounting
the
door
he
had
last
opened
,
he
placed
his
hands
on
the
wall
above
,
and
quickly
drew
himself
up
.
 
<EOS>
Just
as
he
got
on
the
roof
of
the
prison
,
St.
Sepulchre
's
clock
struck
eight
.
<EOS>
It
was
instantly
answered
by
the
deep
note
of
St.
Paul
's
;
and
the
concert
was
prolonged
by
other
neighbouring
churches
.
<EOS>
Jack
had
thus
been
six
hours
in
accomplishing
his
arduous
task
.
 
<EOS>
Though
nearly
dark
,
there
was
still
light
enough
left
to
enable
him
to
discern
surrounding
objects
.
<EOS>
Through
the
gloom
he
distinctly
perceived
the
dome
of
St.
Paul
's
,
hanging
like
a
black
cloud
in
the
air
;
and
nearer
to
him
he
remarked
the
golden
ball
on
the
summit
of
the
College
of
Physicians
,
compared
by
Garth
to
a
"
gilded
pill
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Other
towers
and
spires
--
St
.
<EOS>
Martin
's
on
Ludgate
-
hill
,
and
Christchurch
in
Newgate
Street
,
were
also
distinguishable
.
<EOS>
As
he
gazed
down
into
the
courts
of
the
prison
,
he
could
not
help
shuddering
,
lest
a
false
step
might
precipitate
him
below
.
 
<EOS>
To
prevent
the
recurrence
of
any
such
escape
as
that
just
described
,
it
was
deemed
expedient
,
in
more
recent
times
,
to
keep
a
watchman
at
the
top
of
Newgate
.
<EOS>
Not
many
years
ago
,
two
men
,
employed
on
this
duty
,
quarrelled
during
the
night
,
and
in
the
morning
their
bodies
were
found
stretched
upon
the
pavement
of
the
yard
beneath
.
 
<EOS>
Proceeding
along
the
wall
,
Jack
reached
the
southern
tower
,
over
the
battlements
of
which
he
clambered
,
and
crossing
it
,
dropped
upon
the
roof
of
the
gate
.
<EOS>
He
then
scaled
the
northern
tower
,
and
made
his
way
to
the
summit
of
that
part
of
the
prison
which
fronted
Giltspur
Street
.
<EOS>
Arrived
at
the
extremity
of
the
building
,
he
found
that
it
overlooked
the
flat
-
roof
of
a
house
which
,
as
far
as
he
could
judge
in
the
darkness
,
lay
at
a
depth
of
about
twenty
feet
below
.
 
<EOS>
Not
choosing
to
hazard
so
great
<EOS>
a
fall
,
Jack
turned
to
examine
the
building
,
to
see
whether
any
more
favourable
point
of
descent
presented
itself
,
but
could
discover
nothing
but
steep
walls
,
without
a
single
available
projection
.
<EOS>
As
he
looked
around
,
he
beheld
an
incessant
stream
of
passengers
hurrying
on
below
.
<EOS>
Lights
glimmered
in
the
windows
of
the
different
houses
;
and
a
lamp
-
lighter
was
running
from
post
to
post
on
his
way
to
Snow
Hill
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
it
impossible
to
descend
on
any
side
,
without
incurring
serious
risk
,
Jack
resolved
to
return
for
his
blanket
,
by
the
help
of
which
he
felt
certain
of
accomplishing
a
safe
landing
on
the
roof
of
the
house
in
Giltspur
Street
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
he
began
to
retrace
his
steps
,
and
pursuing
the
course
he
had
recently
taken
,
scaling
the
two
towers
,
and
passing
along
the
wall
of
the
prison
,
he
descended
by
means
of
the
door
upon
the
Lower
Leads
.
<EOS>
Before
he
re
-
entered
the
prison
,
he
hesitated
from
a
doubt
whether
he
was
not
fearfully
increasing
his
risk
of
capture
;
but
,
convinced
that
he
had
no
other
alternative
,
he
went
on
.
 
<EOS>
During
all
this
time
,
he
had
never
quitted
the
iron
bar
,
and
he
now
grasped
it
with
the
firm
determination
of
selling
his
life
dearly
,
if
he
met
with
any
opposition
.
<EOS>
A
few
seconds
sufficed
to
clear
the
passage
,
through
which
it
had
previously
cost
him
more
than
two
hours
to
force
his
way
.
<EOS>
The
floor
was
strewn
with
screws
,
nails
,
fragments
of
wood
and
stone
,
and
across
the
passage
lay
the
heavy
iron
fillet
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
disturb
any
of
this
litter
,
but
left
it
as
a
mark
of
his
prowess
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
now
at
the
entrance
of
the
chapel
,
and
striking
the
door
over
which
he
had
previously
climbed
a
violent
blow
with
the
bar
,
it
flew
open
.
<EOS>
To
vault
over
the
pews
was
the
work
of
a
moment
;
and
having
gained
the
entry
leading
to
the
Red
Room
he
passed
through
the
first
door
;
his
progress
being
only
impeded
by
the
pile
of
broken
stones
,
which
he
himself
had
raised
.
 
<EOS>
Listening
at
one
of
the
doors
leading
to
the
Master
Debtors
'
side
,
he
heard
a
loud
voice
chanting
a
Bacchanalian
melody
,
and
the
boisterous
laughter
that
accompanied
the
song
,
convinced
him
that
no
suspicion
was
entertained
in
this
quarter
.
<EOS>
Entering
the
Red
Room
,
he
crept
through
the
hole
in
the
wall
,
descended
the
chimney
,
and
arrived
once
more
in
his
old
place
of
captivity
.
 
<EOS>
How
different
were
his
present
feelings
compared
with
those
he
had
experienced
on
quitting
it
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Then
_
,
though
full
of
confidence
,
he
half
doubted
his
power
of
accomplishing
his
designs
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Now
_
,
he
_
had
_
achieved
them
,
and
felt
assured
of
success
.
<EOS>
The
vast
heap
of
rubbish
on
the
floor
had
been
so
materially
increased
by
the
bricks
and
plaster
thrown
down
in
his
attack
upon
the
wall
of
the
Red
Room
,
that
it
was
with
some
difficulty
he
could
find
the
blanket
which
was
almost
buried
beneath
the
pile
.
<EOS>
He
next
searched
for
his
stockings
and
shoes
,
and
when
found
,
put
them
on
.
 
<EOS>
While
he
was
thus
employed
,
his
nerves
underwent
a
severe
shock
.
<EOS>
A
few
bricks
,
dislodged
probably
by
his
last
descent
,
came
clattering
down
the
chimney
,
and
as
it
was
perfectly
dark
,
gave
him
the
notion
that
some
one
was
endeavouring
to
force
an
entrance
into
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
But
these
fears
,
like
those
he
had
recently
experienced
,
speedily
vanished
,
and
he
prepared
to
return
to
the
roof
,
congratulating
himself
that
owing
to
the
opportune
falling
of
the
bricks
,
he
had
in
all
probability
escaped
serious
injury
.
 
<EOS>
Throwing
the
blanket
over
his
left
arm
and
shouldering
the
iron
bar
,
he
again
clambered
up
the
chimney
;
regained
the
Red
Room
;
hurried
along
the
first
passage
;
crossed
the
Chapel
;
threaded
the
entry
to
the
Lower
Leads
;
and
,
in
less
than
ten
minutes
after
quitting
the
Castle
,
had
reached
the
northern
extremity
of
the
prison
.
 
<EOS>
Previously
to
his
descent
he
had
left
the
nail
and
spike
on
the
wall
,
and
with
these
he
fastened
the
blanket
to
the
stone
coping
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
he
let
himself
carefully
down
by
it
,
and
having
only
a
few
feet
to
drop
,
alighted
in
safety
.
 
<EOS>
Having
now
fairly
got
out
of
Newgate
for
the
second
time
,
with
a
heart
throbbing
with
exultation
,
he
hastened
to
make
good
his
escape
.
<EOS>
To
his
great
joy
he
found
a
small
garret
-
door
in
the
roof
of
the
opposite
house
open
.
<EOS>
He
entered
it
;
crossed
the
room
,
in
which
there
was
only
a
small
truckle
-
bed
,
over
which
he
stumbled
;
opened
another
door
and
gained
the
stair
-
head
.
<EOS>
As
he
was
about
to
descend
his
chains
slightly
rattled
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
lud
!
<EOS>
what
's
that
?
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
a
female
voice
,
from
an
adjoining
room
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Only
the
dog
,
"
replied
the
rough
tones
of
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
Securing
the
chain
in
the
best
way
he
could
,
Jack
then
hurried
down
two
pair
of
stairs
,
and
had
nearly
reached
the
lobby
,
when
a
door
suddenly
opened
,
and
two
persons
appeared
,
one
of
whom
held
a
light
.
<EOS>
Retreating
as
quickly
as
he
could
,
Jack
opened
the
first
door
he
came
to
,
entered
a
room
,
and
searching
in
the
dark
for
some
place
of
concealment
,
fortunately
discovered
a
skreen
,
behind
which
he
crept
.

CHAPTER
XXI
.
 
<EOS>
What
befell
Jack
Sheppard
in
the
Turner
's
House
.
  
<EOS>
Jack
was
scarcely
concealed
when
the
door
opened
,
and
the
two
persons
of
whom
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
below
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
What
was
his
astonishment
to
recognise
in
the
few
words
they
uttered
the
voices
of
Kneebone
and
Winifred
!
<EOS>
The
latter
was
apparently
in
great
distress
,
and
the
former
seemed
to
be
using
his
best
efforts
to
relieve
her
anxiety
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
very
fortunate
it
is
,
"
he
observed
,
"
that
I
happened
to
call
upon
Mr.
Bird
,
the
turner
,
to
give
him
an
order
this
evening
.
<EOS>
It
was
quite
an
unexpected
pleasure
to
meet
you
and
your
worthy
father
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
cease
these
compliments
,
"
returned
Winifred
,
"
and
,
if
you
have
any
communication
to
make
,
do
not
delay
it
.
<EOS>
You
told
me
just
now
that
you
wished
to
speak
a
few
words
to
me
in
private
,
concerning
Thames
Darrell
,
and
for
that
purpose
I
have
left
my
father
below
with
Mr.
Bird
and
have
come
hither
.
<EOS>
What
have
you
got
to
say
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Too
much
,
"
replied
Kneebone
,
shaking
his
head
;
"
sadly
too
much
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
needlessly
alarm
me
<EOS>
,
I
beseech
you
,
"
replied
Winifred
.
<EOS>
"
Whatever
your
intelligence
may
be
I
will
strive
to
bear
it
.
<EOS>
But
do
not
awaken
my
apprehension
,
unless
you
have
good
cause
for
<EOS>
so
doing.--What
<EOS>
do
you
know
of
Thames?--Where
<EOS>
is
he
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
agitate
yourself
,
dearest
girl
,
"
rejoined
the
woollen
-
draper
;
"
or
I
shall
never
be
able
to
commence
my
relation
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
calm
--
perfectly
calm
,
"
replied
Winifred
.
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
make
no
further
mystery
;
but
tell
me
all
without
reserve
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Since
you
require
it
,
I
must
obey
,
"
replied
Kneebone
;
"
but
prepare
yourself
for
a
terrible
shock
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
For
mercy
's
sake
,
go
on
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Winifred
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
all
hazards
<EOS>
then
then
you
shall
know
the
truth
,
"
replied
the
woollen
-
draper
,
in
a
tone
of
affected
<EOS>
solicitude,--"but
<EOS>
are
you
really
prepared
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Quite
--
quite
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Winifred
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
suspense
is
worse
than
torture
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
almost
afraid
to
utter
it
,
"
said
Kneebone
;
"
but
Thames
Darrell
is
murdered
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Murdered
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Winifred
.
 
<EOS>
"
Basely
and
inhumanly
murdered
,
by
Jack
Sheppard
and
Blueskin
,
"
continued
Kneebone
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
no
--
no
<EOS>
--
no
,
"
cried
Winifred
,
"
<EOS>
I
can
not
believe
it
.
<EOS>
You
must
be
misinformed
,
Mr.
Kneebone
.
<EOS>
Jack
may
be
capable
of
much
that
is
wicked
,
but
he
would
never
lift
his
hand
against
his
friend,--of
that
I
am
assured
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Generous
girl
!
"
cried
Jack
from
behind
the
skreen
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
proofs
to
the
contrary
,
"
replied
Kneebone
.
<EOS>
"
The
murder
was
committed
after
the
robbery
of
my
house
by
Sheppard
and
his
accomplices
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
choose
to
mention
my
knowledge
of
this
fact
to
your
worthy
father
;
but
you
may
rely
on
its
correctness
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
were
right
not
to
mention
it
to
him
,
"
rejoined
Winifred
,
"
for
he
is
in
such
a
state
of
distress
at
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
<EOS>
that
I
fear
any
further
anxiety
might
prove
fatal
to
him
.
<EOS>
And
yet
I
know
not
--
for
the
object
of
his
visit
here
to
-
night
was
to
serve
Jack
,
who
,
if
your
statement
is
correct
,
which
I
can
not
however
for
a
moment
believe
,
does
not
deserve
his
assistance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
rest
assured
<EOS>
he
does
not
,
"
rejoined
Kneebone
,
emphatically
,
"
but
I
am
at
a
loss
to
understand
in
what
way
your
father
proposes
to
assist
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Bird
,
the
turner
,
who
is
an
old
friend
of
our
's
,
has
some
acquaintance
with
the
turnkeys
of
Newgate
,
"
replied
Winifred
,
"
and
by
his
means
my
father
hoped
to
convey
some
implements
to
Jack
,
by
which
he
might
effect
another
escape
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
,
"
remarked
Kneebone
.
<EOS>
"
This
must
be
prevented
,
"
he
added
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
Heaven
grant
<EOS>
you
may
have
been
wrongly
informed
with
respect
to
Thames
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Winifred
;
"
but
,
I
beseech
you
,
on
no
account
to
mention
what
you
have
told
me
to
my
poor
father
.
<EOS>
He
is
not
in
a
state
of
mind
to
bear
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Rely
on
me
,
"
rejoined
Kneebone
.
<EOS>
"
One
word
before
we
part
,
adorable
girl
--
only
one
,
"
he
continued
,
detaining
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
venture
to
renew
my
suit
while
Thames
lived
,
because
I
well
knew
your
affections
were
fixed
upon
him
.
<EOS>
But
now
that
this
bar
is
removed
,
I
trust
I
may
,
without
impropriety
,
urge
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
more
of
this
,
"
said
Winifred
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Is
this
a
season
to
speak
on
such
a
subject
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
not
,
"
rejoined
the
woollen
-
draper
;
"
but
the
uncontrollable
violence
of
my
passion
must
plead
my
excuse
.
<EOS>
My
whole
life
shall
be
devoted
to
you
,
beloved
girl
.
<EOS>
And
when
you
reflect
how
much
at
heart
your
poor
mother
,
whose
loss
we
must
ever
deplore
,
had
our
union
,
you
will
,
I
am
persuaded
,
no
longer
refuse
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
!
"
exclaimed
Winifred
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
make
me
the
happiest
of
mankind
,
"
cried
the
woollen
-
draper
,
falling
on
his
knees
,
and
seizing
her
hand
,
which
he
devoured
with
kisses
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
go
,
"
cried
Winifred
.
<EOS>
"
I
disbelieve
the
whole
story
you
have
told
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
By
Heaven
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Kneebone
,
with
increasing
fervour
<EOS>
,
"
it
is
true
--
as
true
as
my
affection
for
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
doubt
it
,
"
retorted
Winifred
,
scornfully
;
"
because
I
attach
credit
neither
to
one
nor
the
other
.
<EOS>
If
Thames
_
is
_
murdered
,
you
are
his
assassin
.
<EOS>
Let
me
go
,
Sir
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
woollen
-
draper
made
no
answer
,
but
hastily
starting
up
,
bolted
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
cried
Winifred
in
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
more
than
to
obtain
a
favourable
answer
to
my
suit
,
"
replied
Kneebone
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
not
the
way
to
obtain
it
,
"
said
Winifred
,
endeavouring
to
reach
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
go
,
adorable
girl
,
"
cried
Kneebone
,
catching
her
in
his
arms
,
"
till
you
have
answered
me
.
<EOS>
You
must
--
you
shall
be
mine
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
,
"
replied
Winifred
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Release
me
instantly
,
or
I
will
call
my
father
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
so
,
"
replied
Kneebone
;
"
but
remember
the
door
is
locked
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Monster
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Winifred
.
<EOS>
"
Help
!
<EOS>
help
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
call
in
vain
,
"
returned
Kneebone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
so
,
"
replied
Jack
,
throwing
down
the
skreen
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Release
her
instantly
,
villain
!
"
 
<EOS>
Both
Winifred
and
her
suitor
started
at
this
sudden
apparition
.
<EOS>
Jack
,
whose
clothes
were
covered
with
dust
,
and
whose
face
was
deathly
pale
from
his
recent
exertion
,
looked
more
like
a
phantom
than
a
living
person
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
the
devil
's
name
,
is
that
you
,
Jack
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Kneebone
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
"
replied
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
uttered
a
wilful
and
deliberate
falsehood
in
asserting
that
I
have
murdered
Thames
,
for
whom
you
well
know
I
would
lay
down
my
life
.
<EOS>
Retract
your
words
instantly
,
or
take
the
consequences
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
should
I
retract
,
villain
?
"
cried
the
woollen
-
draper
,
who
at
the
sound
of
Jack
's
voice
had
regained
his
confidence
.
<EOS>
"
To
the
best
of
my
belief
,
Thames
Darrell
has
been
murdered
by
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
lie
!
"
exclaimed
Jack
in
a
terrible
tone
.
<EOS>
And
before
Kneebone
could
draw
his
sword
,
he
felled
him
to
the
ground
with
the
iron
bar
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
killed
him
,
"
cried
Winifred
in
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
answered
Jack
,
approaching
her
,
"
though
,
if
I
had
done
so
,
he
would
have
merited
his
fate
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
believe
his
statement
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
,
"
replied
Winifred
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
believe
you
capable
of
so
foul
a
deed
.
<EOS>
But
oh
!
by
what
wonderful
chance
have
you
come
hither
so
seasonably
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
escaped
from
Newgate
,
"
replied
Jack
;
"
and
am
more
than
repaid
for
the
severe
toil
I
have
undergone
,
in
being
able
to
save
you
.
<EOS>
But
tell
me
,
"
he
added
with
much
anxiety
,
"
has
nothing
been
heard
of
Thames
since
the
night
of
my
former
escape
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
whatever
,
"
answered
Winifred
.
"
<EOS>
He
left
Dollis
Hill
at
ten
o'clock
on
that
night
,
and
has
not
since
returned
.
<EOS>
My
father
has
made
every
possible
inquiry
,
and
offered
large
rewards
;
but
has
not
been
able
to
discover
the
slightest
trace
of
him
.
<EOS>
His
suspicions
at
first
fell
upon
you
.
<EOS>
But
he
has
since
acquitted
you
of
any
share
in
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Heaven
!
"
exclaimed
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
been
indefatigable
in
his
search
,
<EOS>
"
continued
Winifred
,
"
and
has
even
journeyed
to
Manchester
.
<EOS>
But
though
he
visited
Sir
Rowland
Trenchard
's
seat
,
Ashton
Hall
,
he
could
gain
no
tidings
of
him
,
or
of
his
uncle
,
Sir
Rowland
,
who
,
it
seems
,
has
left
the
country
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Never
to
return
,
"
remarked
Jack
,
gloomily
.
"
<EOS>
Before
to
-
morrow
morning
I
will
ascertain
what
has
become
of
Thames
,
or
perish
in
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
And
now
tell
me
what
has
happened
to
my
poor
mother
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ever
since
your
last
capture
,
and
Thames
's
mysterious
disappearance
,
she
has
been
dreadfully
ill
,
"
replied
Winifred
;
"
so
ill
,
that
each
day
was
expected
to
be
her
last
.
<EOS>
She
has
also
been
afflicted
with
occasional
returns
of
her
terrible
malady
.
<EOS>
On
Tuesday
night
,
she
was
rather
better
,
and
I
had
left
her
for
a
short
time
,
as
I
thought
,
asleep
on
the
sofa
in
the
little
parlour
of
which
she
is
<EOS>
so
fond--
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
exclaimed
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
On
my
return
,
I
found
the
window
open
,
and
the
room
vacant
.
<EOS>
She
was
gone
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Did
you
discover
any
trace
of
footsteps
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Jack
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
were
some
marks
near
the
window
;
but
whether
recently
made
or
not
could
not
be
ascertained
,
"
replied
Winifred
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
God
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Jack
,
in
a
tone
of
the
bitterest
anguish
.
<EOS>
"
My
worst
fears
are
realized
.
<EOS>
She
is
in
Wild
's
power
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
ought
to
add
,
"
continued
Winifred
,
"
that
one
of
her
shoes
was
picked
up
in
the
garden
,
and
that
prints
of
her
feet
were
discovered
along
the
soft
mould
;
whether
made
in
flying
from
any
one
,
or
from
rushing
forth
in
distracted
terror
,
it
is
impossible
to
say
.
<EOS>
My
father
thought
the
latter
.
<EOS>
He
has
had
the
whole
country
searched
;
but
hitherto
without
success
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
_
where
_
she
will
be
found
,
and
_
how
_
,
"
rejoined
Jack
with
a
shudder
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
something
further
to
tell
you
,
"
pursued
Winifred
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shortly
after
your
last
visit
to
Dollis
Hill
,
my
father
was
one
evening
waylaid
by
a
man
,
who
informed
him
that
he
had
something
to
communicate
respecting
Thames
,
and
had
a
large
sum
of
money
,
and
some
important
documents
to
deliver
to
him
,
which
would
be
given
up
,
provided
he
would
undertake
to
procure
your
liberation
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
Blueskin
,
"
observed
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
my
father
thought
,
"
replied
Winifred
;
"
and
he
therefore
instantly
fired
upon
him
.
<EOS>
But
though
the
shot
took
effect
,
as
was
evident
from
the
stains
on
the
ground
,
the
villain
escaped
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
father
did
right
,
"
replied
Jack
,
with
some
bitterness
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
he
had
not
fired
that
shot
,
he
might
have
saved
Thames
,
and
possessed
himself
of
papers
which
would
have
established
his
birth
,
and
his
right
to
the
estates
of
the
Trenchard
family
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Would
you
have
had
him
spare
my
mother
's
murderer
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Winifred
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ho
,
no
,
"
replied
Jack
.
"
<EOS>
And
yet
--
but
it
is
only
part
of
the
chain
of
ill
-
luck
that
seems
wound
around
me
.
<EOS>
Listen
to
me
,
Winifred
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
hastily
related
the
occurrences
in
Jonathan
Wild
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
The
account
of
the
discovery
of
Sir
Rowland
's
murder
filled
Winifred
with
alarm
;
but
when
she
learnt
what
had
befallen
Thames
--
how
he
had
been
stricken
down
by
the
thief
-
taker
's
bludgeon
,
and
left
for
dead
,
she
uttered
a
piercing
scream
,
fainted
,
and
would
have
fallen
,
if
Jack
had
not
caught
her
in
his
arms
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
had
well
-
nigh
fallen
too
.
<EOS>
The
idea
that
he
held
in
his
arms
the
girl
whom
he
had
once
so
passionately
loved
,
and
for
whom
he
still
retained
an
ardent
but
hopeless
attachment
,
almost
overcame
him
.
<EOS>
Gazing
at
her
with
eyes
blinded
with
tears
,
he
imprinted
one
brotherly
kiss
upon
her
lips
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
first
--
and
the
last
!
 
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
the
handle
of
the
door
was
tried
,
and
the
voice
of
Mr.
Wood
was
heard
without
,
angrily
demanding
admittance
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
I
heard
a
scream
.
<EOS>
Why
is
the
door
fastened
?
<EOS>
Open
it
directly
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
alone
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Jack
,
mimicking
the
voice
of
Kneebone
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
for
?
"
demanded
Wood
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Open
the
door
,
I
say
,
or
I
'll
burst
it
open
.
"
 
<EOS>
Carefully
depositing
Winifred
on
a
sofa
,
Jack
then
extinguished
the
light
,
and
,
as
he
unfastened
the
door
,
crept
behind
it
.
<EOS>
In
rushed
Mr.
Wood
,
with
a
candle
in
his
hand
,
which
Jack
instantly
blew
out
,
and
darted
down
stairs
.
<EOS>
He
upset
some
one
--
probably
Mr.
Bird,--who
was
rushing
up
stairs
,
alarmed
by
Mr.
Wood
's
cries
:
but
,
regardless
of
this
,
he
darted
along
a
passage
,
gained
the
shop
,
and
passed
through
an
open
door
into
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
And
thus
he
was
once
more
free
,
having
effected
one
of
the
most
wonderful
escapes
ever
planned
or
accomplished
.
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XXII
.
 
<EOS>
Fast
and
Loose
.
  
<EOS>
About
seven
o'clock
on
the
same
night
,
Jonathan
Wild
's
two
janizaries
,
who
had
been
for
some
time
in
attendance
in
the
hall
of
his
dwelling
at
the
Old
Bailey
,
were
summoned
to
the
audience
-
chamber
.
<EOS>
A
long
and
secret
conference
then
took
place
between
the
thief
-
taker
and
his
myrmidons
,
after
which
they
were
severally
dismissed
.
 
<EOS>
Left
alone
,
Jonathan
lighted
a
lamp
,
and
,
opening
the
trap
-
door
,
descended
the
secret
stairs
.
<EOS>
Taking
the
opposite
course
from
that
which
he
had
hitherto
pursued
when
it
has
been
necessary
to
attend
him
in
his
visits
to
the
lower
part
of
his
premises
,
he
struck
into
a
narrow
passage
on
the
right
,
which
he
tracked
till
he
came
to
a
small
door
,
like
the
approach
to
a
vault
.
<EOS>
Unlocking
it
,
he
entered
the
chamber
,
which
by
no
means
belied
its
external
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
On
a
pallet
in
one
corner
lay
a
pale
emaciated
female
.
<EOS>
Holding
the
lamp
over
her
rigid
but
beautiful
features
,
Jonathan
,
with
some
anxiety
,
placed
his
hand
upon
her
breast
to
ascertain
whether
the
heart
still
beat
.
<EOS>
Satisfied
with
his
scrutiny
,
he
produced
a
pocket
-
flask
,
and
taking
off
the
silver
cup
with
which
it
was
mounted
,
filled
it
with
the
contents
of
the
flask
,
and
then
seizing
the
thin
arm
of
the
sleeper
,
rudely
shook
it
.
<EOS>
Opening
her
large
black
eyes
,
she
fixed
them
upon
him
for
a
moment
with
a
mixture
of
terror
and
loathing
,
and
then
averted
her
gaze
.
 
<EOS>
"
Drink
this
,
"
cried
Jonathan
,
handing
her
the
cup
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
feel
better
after
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mechanically
raising
the
potion
to
her
lips
,
the
poor
creature
swallowed
it
without
hesitation
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
it
poison
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Jonathan
,
with
a
brutal
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
going
to
get
rid
of
you
just
yet
.
<EOS>
It
's
gin
--
a
liquor
you
used
to
like
.
<EOS>
You
'll
find
the
benefit
of
it
by
and
by
.
<EOS>
You
've
a
good
deal
to
go
through
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
"
are
you
come
to
renew
your
terrible
proposals
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
come
to
execute
my
threats
,
"
replied
Wild
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
-
night
you
shall
be
my
wedded
wife
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
die
first
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
die
_
afterwards
_
as
soon
as
you
please
,
"
retorted
Jonathan
;
"
but
live
till
then
<EOS>
you
_
shall
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
I
've
sent
for
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mercy
!
"
cried
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
vainly
trying
to
discover
a
gleam
of
compassion
in
the
thief
-
taker
's
inexorable
countenance,--"Mercy
!
<EOS>
mercy
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pshaw
!
"
rejoined
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
You
should
be
glad
to
be
made
an
honest
woman
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
let
me
die
,
"
groaned
the
widow
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
many
days,--perhaps
,
not
many
hours
to
live
.
<EOS>
But
kill
me
rather
than
commit
this
outrage
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
would
n't
answer
my
purpose
,
"
replied
Jonathan
,
savagely
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
carry
you
off
from
old
Wood
to
kill
you
,
but
to
we
d
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
motive
can
you
have
for
so
vile
a
deed
?
"
asked
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
my
motive
well
enough
,
"
answered
Jonathan
.
"
<EOS>
However
,
I
'll
refresh
your
memory
.
<EOS>
I
once
might
have
married
you
for
your
<EOS>
beauty,--now
<EOS>
I
marry
you
for
your
wealth
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
wealth
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
heiress
to
the
Trenchard
property
,
"
rejoined
Jonathan
,
"
one
of
the
largest
estates
in
Lancashire
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
while
Thames
Darrell
and
Sir
Rowland
live
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
Rowland
is
dead
,
"
replied
Jonathan
,
gloomily
.
"
<EOS>
Thames
Darrell
only
waits
my
mandate
to
follow
him
.
<EOS>
Before
our
marriage
there
will
be
no
life
between
you
and
the
estates
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
here
,
"
cried
Jonathan
,
stooping
down
and
taking
hold
of
a
ring
in
the
floor
,
with
which
by
a
great
effort
he
raised
up
a
flag
.
<EOS>
"
In
this
pit
,
"
he
added
,
pointing
to
the
chasm
below
,
"
your
brother
is
buried
.
<EOS>
Here
your
nephew
will
speedily
be
thrown
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Horrible
!
"
cried
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
shuddering
violently
.
"
<EOS>
But
your
dreadful
projects
will
recoil
on
your
own
head
.
<EOS>
Heaven
will
not
permit
the
continuance
of
such
wickedness
as
you
practise
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
take
my
chance
,
"
replied
Jonathan
,
with
a
sinister
smile
.
<EOS>
"
My
schemes
have
succeeded
tolerably
well
hitherto
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
day
of
retribution
will
assuredly
arrive
,
"
rejoined
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Till
then
,
I
shall
remain
content
,
"
returned
Wild
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
attend
to
what
I
'm
about
to
say
to
you
.
<EOS>
Years
ago
,
when
you
were
a
girl
and
in
the
bloom
of
your
beauty
,
I
loved
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Loved
me
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
You
_
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
loved
you
,
"
continued
Jonathan
,
"
and
struck
by
your
appearance
,
which
seemed
above
your
station
,
inquired
your
history
,
and
found
you
had
been
stolen
by
a
gipsy
in
Lancashire
.
<EOS>
I
proceeded
to
Manchester
,
to
investigate
the
matter
further
,
and
when
there
ascertained
,
beyond
a
doubt
,
that
you
were
the
eldest
daughter
of
Sir
Montacute
Trenchard
.
<EOS>
This
discovery
made
,
I
hastened
back
to
London
to
offer
you
my
hand
,
but
found
you
had
married
in
the
mean
time
a
smock
-
faced
,
smooth
-
tongued
carpenter
named
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
The
important
secret
remained
locked
in
my
breast
,
but
I
resolved
to
be
avenged
.
<EOS>
I
swore
I
would
bring
your
husband
to
the
gallows,--would
plunge
you
in
such
want
,
<EOS>
such
distress
,
that
you
should
have
no
alternative
but
the
last
frightful
resource
of
misery,--and
<EOS>
I
also
swore
,
that
if
you
had
a
son
he
should
share
the
same
fate
as
his
father
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
terribly
you
have
kept
your
vow
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
,
"
replied
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
now
coming
to
the
point
which
most
concerns
you
.
<EOS>
Consent
to
become
my
wife
,
and
do
not
compel
me
to
have
recourse
to
violence
to
effect
my
purpose
,
and
I
will
spare
your
son
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Sheppard
looked
fixedly
at
him
,
as
if
she
would
penetrate
the
gloomy
depth
of
his
soul
.
 
<EOS>
"
Swear
that
you
will
do
this
,
"
she
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
swear
it
,
"
rejoined
Jonathan
,
readily
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
what
is
an
oath
to
you
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
widow
,
distrustfully
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
hesitate
to
break
it
,
if
it
suits
your
purpose
.
<EOS>
I
have
suffered
too
much
from
your
treachery
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
trust
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
As
you
please
,
"
replied
Jonathan
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
Recollect
you
are
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
Jack
's
life
hangs
on
your
determination
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
shall
I
do
?
"
cried
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
in
a
voice
of
agony
.
 
<EOS>
"
Save
him
,
"
replied
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
You
_
can
_
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Bring
him
<EOS>
here,--let
<EOS>
me
see
him
--
let
me
embrace
him
--
let
me
be
assured
that
he
is
safe
,
and
I
am
yours
.
<EOS>
I
swear
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hum
!
"
exclaimed
Jonathan
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
hesitate
--
you
are
deceiving
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
By
my
soul
,
no
,
"
replied
Jonathan
,
with
affected
sincerity
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
see
him
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Delay
the
marriage
till
then
.
<EOS>
I
will
never
consent
till
I
see
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yon
ask
impossibilities
,
"
replied
Jonathan
,
sullenly
.
<EOS>
"
All
is
prepared
.
<EOS>
The
marriage
cannot
--
shall
not
be
delayed
.
<EOS>
Yon
must
be
mine
to
-
night
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Force
shall
not
make
me
yours
till
Jack
is
free
,
"
replied
the
widow
,
resolutely
.
 
<EOS>
"
An
hour
hence
,
I
shall
return
with
the
priest
,
"
replied
Jonathan
,
striding
towards
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
with
a
glance
of
malignant
exultation
,
he
quitted
the
vault
,
and
locked
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
An
hour
hence
,
I
shall
be
beyond
your
malice
,
"
said
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
sinking
backwards
upon
the
pallet
.

CHAPTER
XXIII
.
 
<EOS>
The
last
Meeting
between
Jack
Sheppard
and
his
Mother
.
  
<EOS>
After
escaping
from
the
turner
's
house
,
Jack
Sheppard
skirted
St.
Sepulchre
's
church
,
and
hurrying
down
Snow
Hill
,
darted
into
the
first
turning
on
the
left
.
<EOS>
Traversing
Angel
Court
,
and
Green
Arbour
Court,--celebrated
as
one
of
Goldsmith
's
retreats,--he
speedily
reached
Seacoal
Lane
,
and
pursuing
the
same
course
,
which
he
and
Thames
had
formerly
taken
,
arrived
at
the
yard
at
the
back
of
Jonathan
's
habitation
.
 
<EOS>
A
door
,
it
may
be
remembered
,
opened
from
Wild
's
dwelling
into
this
yard
.
<EOS>
Before
he
forced
an
entrance
,
Jack
tried
it
,
and
,
to
his
great
surprise
and
delight
,
found
it
unfastened
.
<EOS>
Entering
the
house
,
he
found
himself
in
a
narrow
passage
leading
to
the
back
stairs
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
taken
many
steps
when
he
perceived
Quilt
Arnold
in
the
upper
gallery
,
with
a
lamp
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
Hearing
a
noise
below
,
Quilt
called
out
,
supposing
it
occasioned
by
the
Jew
.
<EOS>
Jack
hastily
retreated
,
and
taking
the
first
means
of
concealment
that
occurred
to
him
,
descended
the
cellar
steps
.
 
<EOS>
Quilt
,
meanwhile
,
came
down
,
examined
the
door
,
and
finding
it
unfastened
,
locked
it
with
a
bitter
imprecation
on
his
brother
-
janizary
's
carelessness
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
he
followed
the
course
which
Jack
had
just
taken
.
<EOS>
As
he
crossed
the
cellar
,
he
passed
so
near
to
Jack
who
had
concealed
himself
behind
a
piece
of
furniture
that
he
almost
touched
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
Jack
's
intention
to
have
knocked
him
down
with
the
iron
bar
;
but
he
was
so
struck
with
the
janizary
's
looks
,
that
he
determined
to
spare
him
till
he
had
ascertained
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
With
this
view
,
he
suffered
him
to
pass
on
.
 
<EOS>
Quilt
's
manner
,
indeed
,
was
that
of
a
man
endeavouring
to
muster
up
sufficient
resolution
for
the
commission
of
some
desperate
crime
.
<EOS>
He
halted,--looked
fearfully
around,--stopped
again
,
and
exclaimed
aloud
,
"
I
do
n't
like
the
job
;
and
yet
it
must
be
done
,
or
Mr.
Wild
will
hang
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
this
,
he
appeared
to
pluck
up
his
courage
,
and
stepped
forward
more
boldly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Some
dreadful
deed
is
about
to
be
committed
,
which
I
may
perhaps
prevent
,
"
muttered
Jack
to
himself
.
"
<EOS>
Heaven
grant
<EOS>
I
may
not
be
too
late
!
"
 
<EOS>
Followed
by
Jack
Sheppard
,
who
kept
sufficiently
near
him
to
watch
his
proceedings
,
and
yet
not
expose
himself
,
Quilt
unlocked
one
or
two
doors
which
he
left
open
,
and
after
winding
his
way
along
a
gloomy
passage
,
arrived
at
the
door
of
a
vault
.
<EOS>
Here
he
set
down
the
lamp
,
and
took
out
a
key
,
and
as
he
did
so
the
expression
of
his
countenance
was
so
atrocious
,
that
Jack
felt
assured
he
was
not
wrong
in
his
suspicions
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
the
door
was
unlocked
,
and
drawing
his
sword
,
Quilt
entered
the
cell
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
,
an
exclamation
was
heard
in
the
voice
of
Thames
.
<EOS>
Darting
forward
at
this
sound
,
Jack
threw
open
the
door
,
and
beheld
Quilt
kneeling
over
Thames
,
who'se
hands
and
feet
were
bound
with
cords
,
and
about
to
plunge
his
sword
into
his
breast
.
<EOS>
A
blow
from
the
iron
bar
instantly
stretched
the
ruffian
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
Jack
then
proceeded
to
liberate
the
captive
from
his
bondage
.
 
<EOS>
"
Jack
!
"
exclaimed
Thames
.
<EOS>
"
Is
it
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
"
replied
Sheppard
,
as
he
untied
the
cords
.
<EOS>
"
I
might
return
the
question
.
<EOS>
Were
it
not
for
your
voice
,
I
do
n't
think
I
should
know
you
.
<EOS>
You
are
greatly
altered
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Captivity
had
,
indeed
,
produced
a
striking
alteration
in
Thames
.
<EOS>
He
looked
like
the
shadow
of
himself
--
thin
,
feeble
,
hollow
-
eyed
--
his
beard
unshorn
--
nothing
could
be
more
miserable
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
been
out
of
this
horrible
dungeon
since
we
last
met
,
"
he
said
;
"
<EOS>
though
how
long
ago
that
is
,
I
scarcely
know
.
<EOS>
Night
and
day
have
been
alike
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Six
weeks
have
elapsed
since
that
fatal
night
,
"
replied
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
During
the
whole
of
that
time
I
have
been
a
close
prisoner
in
Newgate
,
whence
I
have
only
just
escaped
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Six
weeks
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Thames
,
in
a
melancholy
tone
.
<EOS>
"
It
seems
like
six
long
months
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
doubt
it
,
"
returned
Jack
;
<EOS>
"
none
but
those
who
have
experienced
it
can
understand
the
miseries
of
imprisonment
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
speak
of
it
,
"
rejoined
Thames
,
with
a
look
of
horror
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
fly
from
this
frightful
place
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
conduct
you
to
the
outlet
,
"
replied
Jack
;
"
but
I
can
not
leave
it
till
I
have
ascertained
whether
my
mother
also
is
a
prisoner
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
answer
that
,
"
replied
Thames
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
.
<EOS>
The
monster
,
Wild
,
when
he
visited
my
dungeon
last
night
,
told
me
,
to
add
to
my
misery
,
that
she
occupied
a
cell
near
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Arm
yourself
with
that
ruffian
's
weapons
,
"
replied
Jack
,
"
and
let
us
search
for
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
Thames
complied
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
so
feeble
,
that
it
seemed
scarcely
possible
he
could
offer
any
effectual
resistance
in
case
of
an
attack
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lean
on
me
,
"
said
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
Taking
the
light
,
they
then
proceeded
along
the
passage
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
other
door
in
it
,
and
Jack
therefore
struck
into
another
entry
which
branched
off
to
the
right
.
<EOS>
They
had
not
proceeded
far
when
a
low
moan
was
heard
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
here
,
"
cried
Jack
,
darting
forward
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
steps
brought
him
to
the
door
of
the
vault
in
which
his
mother
was
immured
.
<EOS>
It
was
locked
.
<EOS>
Jack
had
brought
away
the
bunch
of
keys
which
he
had
taken
from
Quilt
Arnold
,
but
,
none
of
them
would
open
it
.
<EOS>
He
was
therefore
obliged
to
use
the
iron
bar
,
which
he
did
with
as
much
caution
as
circumstances
would
permit
.
<EOS>
At
the
first
blow
,
Mrs.
Sheppard
uttered
a
piercing
scream
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wretch
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
"
you
shall
not
force
me
to
your
hateful
purpose
.
<EOS>
I
will
never
we
d
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
weapon
--
a
knife
--
and
if
you
attempt
to
open
the
door
,
will
plunge
it
to
my
heart
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
God
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Jack
,
paralysed
by
her
cries
.
<EOS>
"
What
shall
I
do
?
<EOS>
If
I
persist
,
I
shall
destroy
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Get
hence
,
"
continued
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
with
a
frenzied
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
never
behold
me
alive
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mother
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jack
,
in
a
broken
voice
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
your
son
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
false
,
"
cried
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
Think
not
to
deceive
me
,
monster
.
<EOS>
I
know
my
son
's
voice
too
well
.
<EOS>
He
is
in
Newgate
.
<EOS>
Hence
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mother
!
<EOS>
dear
mother
!
"
cried
Jack
,
in
a
voice
,
the
tones
of
which
were
altered
by
his
very
anxiety
to
make
them
distinct
,
"
listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
broken
from
prison
,
and
am
come
to
save
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
_
not
_
Jack
's
voice
,
"
rejoined
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
to
be
deceived
.
<EOS>
The
knife
is
at
my
breast
.
<EOS>
Stir
a
foot
,
and
I
strike
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
Heavens
!
"
cried
Jack
,
driven
to
his
wits
'
end
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mother
--
dear
mother
!
<EOS>
Once
again
,
I
beseech
you
to
listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
come
to
rescue
you
from
Wild
's
violence
.
<EOS>
I
must
break
open
the
door
.
<EOS>
Hold
your
hand
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
heard
my
fixed
determination
,
villain
,
"
cried
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
my
life
is
valuable
to
you
,
or
you
would
not
spare
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
disappoint
you
.
<EOS>
Get
you
gone
.
<EOS>
Your
purposes
are
defeated
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Footsteps
are
approaching
,
"
cried
Thames
.
<EOS>
"
Heed
her
not
.
<EOS>
It
is
but
a
wild
threat
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
how
to
act
,
"
exclaimed
Jack
,
almost
driven
to
desperation
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hear
you
plotting
with
your
wicked
associates
,
"
cried
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
baffled
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Force
the
door
,
"
said
Thames
,
"
or
you
will
be
too
late
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Better
she
die
by
her
own
hand
,
than
by
that
monster
's
,
"
cried
Jack
,
brandishing
the
bar
.
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
I
come
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
,
he
struck
the
door
a
heavy
blow
.
 
<EOS>
He
listened
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
deep
groan
,
and
the
sound
of
a
fall
within
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
killed
her
,
"
exclaimed
Jack
,
dropping
the
bar,--"by
your
advice
,
Thames
.
<EOS>
Oh
God
!
<EOS>
pardon
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
delay
,
"
cried
Thames
.
<EOS>
"
She
may
yet
be
saved
.
<EOS>
I
am
too
weak
to
aid
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
Jack
again
seized
the
bar
,
and
,
dashing
it
furiously
against
the
door
,
speedily
burst
it
open
.
 
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
woman
was
stretched
upon
the
floor
,
with
a
bloody
knife
in
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mother
!
"
cried
Jack
,
springing
towards
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Jack
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
raising
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
Is
it
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
"
replied
her
son
,
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
why
would
you
not
listen
to
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
distracted
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
faintly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
killed
you
,
"
cried
Jack
,
endeavouring
to
staunch
the
effusion
of
blood
from
her
breast
.
<EOS>
"
Forgive
--
forgive
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
to
forgive
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
I
alone
am
to
blame
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Can
I
not
carry
you
where
you
can
obtain
help
?
"
cried
Jack
in
a
agony
of
distress
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
useless
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Sheppard
:
"
nothing
can
save
me
.
<EOS>
I
die
happy
--
quite
happy
in
beholding
you
.
<EOS>
Do
not
remain
with
me
.
<EOS>
You
may
fall
into
the
hands
of
your
enemy
.
<EOS>
Fly
!
fly
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
think
of
me
,
mother
,
but
of
yourself
,
"
cried
Jack
,
in
an
agony
of
tears
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
always
been
,
far
dearer
to
me
than
myself
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
one
last
request
to
make
.
<EOS>
Let
me
lie
in
Willesden
churchyard
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
--
you
shall
,
"
answered
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
meet
again
<EOS>
ere
long
,
my
son
,
"
cried
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
fixing
her
glazing
eyes
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
God
!
<EOS>
she
is
dying
,
"
exclaimed
Jack
in
a
voice
suffocated
by
emotion
.
"
<EOS>
Forgive
me
--
oh
,
forgive
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Forgive
you
--
bless
you
!
"
<EOS>
she
gasped
.
 
<EOS>
A
cold
shiver
ran
through
her
frame
,
and
her
gentle
spirit
passed
away
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
God
!
<EOS>
that
I
might
die
too
,
"
cried
Jack
,
falling
on
his
knees
beside
her
.
 
<EOS>
After
the
first
violent
outbreak
of
grief
had
in
some
degree
subsided
,
Thames
addressed
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
remain
here
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
render
no
further
service
to
your
poor
mother
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
avenge
her
,
"
cried
Jack
in
a
terrible
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
ruled
by
me
,
"
returned
Thames
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
act
most
in
accordance
with
her
wishes
,
could
she
dictate
them
,
by
compliance
.
<EOS>
Do
not
waste
time
in
vain
regrets
,
but
let
us
remove
the
body
,
that
we
may
fulfil
her
last
injunctions
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
After
some
further
arguments
,
Jack
assented
to
this
proposal
.
 
<EOS>
"
Go
on
first
with
the
light
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
bear
the
body
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
raised
it
in
his
arms
.
 
<EOS>
Just
as
they
reached
the
end
of
the
passage
,
they
heard
the
voices
of
Jonathan
and
the
Jew
in
Thames
's
late
place
of
confinement
.
<EOS>
Wild
had
evidently
discovered
the
body
of
Quilt
Arnold
,
and
was
loudly
expressing
his
anger
and
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
"
Extinguish
the
light
,
"
cried
Jack
;
"
turn
to
the
left
.
<EOS>
Quick
!
<EOS>
Quick
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
order
was
only
just
given
in
time
.
<EOS>
They
had
scarcely
gained
the
adjoining
cellar
when
Jonathan
and
the
Jew
rushed
past
in
the
direction
of
the
vault
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
a
moment
is
to
be
lost
,
"
cried
Jack
:
"
follow
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
hurried
up
stairs
,
opened
the
back
door
,
and
was
quickly
in
the
yard
.
<EOS>
Having
ascertained
that
Thames
was
at
his
heels
,
he
hurried
with
his
ghastly
burthen
down
Seacoal
Lane
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
are
you
going
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Thames
,
who
,
though
wholly
disencumbered
,
was
scarcely
able
to
keep
up
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
--
and
care
not
,
"
replied
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
a
coach
passed
them
,
and
was
instantly
hailed
by
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
let
me
convey
her
to
Dollis
Hill
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
it
so
,
"
replied
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
Luckily
it
was
so
dark
,
and
there
was
no
lamp
near
,
that
the
man
did
not
notice
the
condition
of
the
body
,
which
was
placed
in
the
vehicle
by
the
two
young
men
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
will
you
do
?
"
asked
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
"
Leave
me
to
my
fate
,
"
rejoined
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
Take
care
of
your
charge
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Doubt
me
not
,
"
replied
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bury
her
in
Willesden
churchyard
,
as
she
requested
,
on
Sunday
,
"
said
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
there
at
the
time
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
closed
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
The
coachman
having
received
his
order
,
and
being
offered
an
extra
fare
if
he
drove
quickly
,
set
off
at
full
speed
.
 
<EOS>
As
Jack
departed
,
a
dark
figure
,
emerging
from
behind
a
wall
,
rushed
after
him
.
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XXIV
.
 
<EOS>
The
Pursuit
.
  
<EOS>
After
running
to
some
distance
down
Seacoal
Lane
,
Jack
stopped
to
give
a
last
look
at
the
vehicle
which
was
bearing
away
the
remains
of
his
beloved
and
ill
-
fated
mother
.
<EOS>
It
was
scarcely
out
of
sight
,
when
two
persons
,
whom
,
he
instantly
recognised
as
Jonathan
and
Abraham
Mendez
,
turned
the
corner
of
the
street
,
and
made
it
evident
from
their
shouts
,
that
they
likewise
perceived
him
.
 
<EOS>
Starting
off
at
a
rapid
pace
,
Jack
dashed
down
Turnagain
-
lane
,
skirted
the
eastern
bank
of
Fleet
-
ditch
,
crossed
Holborn
Bridge
,
and
began
to
ascend
the
neighbouring
hill
.
<EOS>
By
the
time
he
had
reached
St.
Andrew
's
Church
,
his
pursuers
had
gained
the
bridge
,
and
the
attention
of
such
passengers
as
crowded
the
streets
was
attracted
towards
him
by
their
vociferations
.
<EOS>
Amongst
others
,
the
watchman
whose
box
was
placed
against
the
churchyard
wall
,
near
the
entrance
to
Shoe
-
lane
,
rushed
out
and
sprung
his
rattle
,
which
was
immediately
answered
by
another
rattle
from
Holborn
-
bars
.
 
<EOS>
Darting
down
Field
-
lane
,
Jack
struck
into
a
labyrinth
of
streets
on
the
left
;
but
though
he
ran
as
swiftly
as
he
could
,
he
was
not
unperceived
.
<EOS>
His
course
had
been
observed
by
the
watchman
,
who
directed
Wild
which
way
to
take
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
Jack
Sheppard
,
the
noted
housebreaker
,
"
cried
Jonathan
,
at
the
top
of
his
sonorous
voice
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
just
broken
out
of
Newgate
.
<EOS>
After
him
!
<EOS>
A
hundred
pounds
to
the
man
who
takes
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
Sheppard
's
name
operated
like
magic
on
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
The
cry
was
echoed
by
twenty
different
voices
.
<EOS>
People
ran
out
of
their
shops
to
join
the
pursuit
;
and
,
by
the
time
Wild
had
got
into
Field
-
lane
,
he
had
a
troop
of
fifty
persons
at
his
heels
--
all
eager
to
assist
in
the
capture
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stop
thief
!
"
<EOS>
roared
Jonathan
,
who
perceived
the
fugitive
hurrying
along
a
street
towards
Hatton
Garden
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
Sheppard
--
Jack
Sheppard
--
stop
him
!
"
<EOS>
And
his
shouts
were
reiterated
by
the
pack
of
bloodhounds
at
his
heels
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
,
meanwhile
,
heard
,
the
shouts
,
and
,
though
alarmed
by
them
,
held
on
a
steady
course
.
<EOS>
By
various
twistings
and
turnings
,
during
all
which
time
his
pursuers
,
who
were
greatly
increased
in
numbers
,
kept
him
in
view
,
he
reached
Gray's
-
Inn
-
lane
.
<EOS>
Here
he
was
hotly
pursued
.
<EOS>
Fatigued
by
his
previous
exertions
,
and
incumbered
by
his
fetters
,
he
was
by
no
means
--
though
ordinarily
remarkably
swift
of
foot
--
<EOS>
a
match
for
his
foes
,
who
were
fast
gaining
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
corner
of
Liquorpond
Street
stood
the
old
Hampstead
coach
-
office
;
and
,
on
the
night
in
question
,
a
knot
of
hostlers
,
waggoners
,
drivers
,
and
stable
-
boys
was
collected
in
the
yard
.
<EOS>
Hearing
the
distant
shouts
,
these
fellows
rushed
down
to
the
entrance
of
the
court
,
and
arrived
there
just
as
Jack
passed
it
.
"
<EOS>
Stop
thief
!
"
<EOS>
roared
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
Stop
thief
!
"
<EOS>
clamoured
the
rabble
behind
.
 
<EOS>
At
no
loss
to
comprehend
that
Jack
was
the
individual
pointed
out
by
these
outcries
,
two
of
the
nearest
of
the
group
made
a
dash
at
him
.
<EOS>
But
Jack
eluded
their
grasp
.
<EOS>
A
large
dog
was
then
set
at
him
by
a
stable
-
boy
;
but
,
striking
the
animal
with
his
faithful
iron
-
bar
,
he
speedily
sent
him
yelping
back
.
<EOS>
The
two
hostlers
,
however
,
kept
close
at
his
heels
;
and
Jack
,
whose
strength
began
to
flag
,
feared
he
could
not
hold
much
longer
.
<EOS>
Determined
,
however
,
not
be
taken
with
life
,
he
held
on
.
 
<EOS>
Still
keeping
ahead
of
his
pursuers
,
he
ran
along
the
direct
road
,
till
the
houses
disappeared
and
he
got
into
the
open
country
.
<EOS>
Here
he
was
preparing
to
leap
over
the
hedge
into
the
fields
on
the
left
,
when
he
was
intercepted
by
two
horsemen
,
who
,
hearing
the
shouts
,
rode
up
and
struck
at
him
with
the
butt
-
ends
of
their
heavy
riding
-
whips
.
<EOS>
Warding
off
the
blows
as
well
as
he
could
with
the
bar
,
Jack
struck
both
the
horses
on
the
head
,
and
the
animals
plunged
so
violently
,
that
they
not
only
prevented
their
riders
from
assailing
him
,
but
also
kept
off
the
hostlers
;
and
,
in
the
confusion
that
ensued
,
Jack
managed
to
spring
over
the
fence
,
and
shaped
his
course
across
the
field
in
the
direction
of
Sir
John
Oldcastle
's
.
 
<EOS>
The
stoppage
had
materially
lessened
the
distance
between
him
and
his
pursuers
,
who
now
amounted
to
more
than
a
hundred
persons
,
many
of
whom
carried
lanterns
and
links
.
<EOS>
Ascertaining
that
it
was
Sheppard
of
whom
this
concourse
was
in
pursuit
,
the
two
horsemen
leapt
the
hedge
,
and
were
presently
close
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Like
a
hare
closely
pressed
,
Jack
attempted
to
double
,
but
the
device
only
brought
him
nearer
his
foes
,
who
were
crossing
the
field
in
every
direction
,
and
rending
the
air
with
their
shouts
.
<EOS>
The
uproar
was
tremendous
--
men
yelling
--
dogs
<EOS>
barking,--but
<EOS>
above
all
was
heard
the
stentorian
voice
of
Jonathan
,
urging
them
on
.
<EOS>
Jack
was
so
harrassed
that
he
felt
half
inclined
to
stand
at
bay
.
 
<EOS>
While
he
was
straining
every
sinew
,
his
foot
slipped
,
and
he
fell
,
head
foremost
,
into
a
deep
trench
,
which
he
had
not
observed
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
This
fall
saved
him
,
for
the
horsemen
passed
over
him
.
<EOS>
Creeping
along
quickly
on
his
hands
and
knees
,
he
found
the
entrance
to
a
covered
drain
,
into
which
he
crept
.
<EOS>
He
was
scarcely
concealed
when
he
heard
the
horsemen
,
who
perceived
they
had
overshot
their
mark
,
ride
back
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
Jonathan
and
the
vast
mob
attending
him
,
had
come
up
,
and
the
place
was
rendered
almost
as
light
as
day
by
the
links
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
must
be
somewhere
hereabouts
,
"
cried
one
of
the
horsemen
,
dismounting
.
<EOS>
"
We
were
close
upon
him
when
he
suddenly
disappeared
.
"
 
<EOS>
Jonathan
made
no
answer
,
but
snatching
a
torch
from
a
bystander
,
jumped
into
the
trench
and
commenced
a
diligent
search
.
<EOS>
Just
as
he
had
arrived
at
the
mouth
of
the
drain
,
and
Jack
felt
certain
he
must
be
discovered
,
a
loud
shout
was
raised
from
the
further
end
of
the
field
that
the
fugitive
was
caught
.
<EOS>
All
the
assemblage
,
accompanied
by
Jonathan
,
set
off
in
this
direction
,
when
it
turned
out
that
the
supposed
housebreaker
was
a
harmless
beggar
,
who
had
been
found
asleep
under
a
hedge
.
 
<EOS>
Jonathan
's
vexation
at
the
disappointment
was
expressed
in
the
bitterest
imprecations
,
and
he
returned
as
speedily
as
he
could
to
the
trench
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
now
lost
the
precise
spot
;
and
thinking
he
had
examined
the
drain
,
turned
his
attention
to
another
quarter
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
excitement
of
the
chase
had
in
some
degree
subsided
.
<EOS>
The
crowd
dispersed
in
different
directions
,
and
most
fortunately
a
heavy
shower
coming
on
,
put
them
altogether
to
flight
.
<EOS>
Jonathan
,
however
,
still
lingered
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
wholly
insensible
to
the
rain
,
though
it
presently
descended
in
torrents
,
and
continued
his
search
as
ardently
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
After
occupying
himself
thus
for
the
best
part
of
an
hour
,
he
thought
Jack
must
have
given
him
the
slip
.
<EOS>
Still
,
his
suspicions
were
so
strong
,
that
he
ordered
Mendez
to
remain
on
guard
near
the
spot
all
night
,
and
,
by
the
promise
of
a
large
reward
induced
two
other
men
to
keep
him
company
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
took
his
departure
,
he
whispered
to
the
Jew
:
"
Take
him
dead
or
alive
;
but
if
we
fail
now
,
and
you
heard
him
aright
in
Seacoal
Lane
,
we
are
sure
of
him
at
his
mother
's
funeral
on
Sunday
.
"
    
CHAPTER
XXV
.
 
<EOS>
How
Jack
Sheppard
got
rid
of
his
Irons
.
  
<EOS>
About
an
hour
after
this
,
Jack
ventured
to
emerge
from
his
place
of
concealment
.
<EOS>
It
was
still
raining
heavily
,
and
profoundly
dark
.
<EOS>
Drenched
to
the
skin,--in
fact
,
he
had
been
lying
in
a
bed
of
muddy
water,--and
chilled
to
the
very
bone
<EOS>
,
he
felt
so
stiff
,
that
he
could
scarcely
move
.
 
<EOS>
Listening
attentively
,
he
fancied
he
heard
the
breathing
of
some
one
near
him
,
and
moved
cautiously
in
the
opposite
direction
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
his
care
,
he
came
in
contact
with
a
man
,
who
,
endeavouring
to
grasp
him
,
cried
,
in
the
voice
of
Mendez
,
"
Who
goes
dere
?
<EOS>
Shpeak
!
<EOS>
or
I
fire
!
"
 
<EOS>
No
answer
being
returned
,
the
Jew
instantly
discharged
his
pistol
,
and
though
the
shot
did
no
damage
,
the
flash
discovered
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
But
as
the
next
moment
all
was
profound
darkness
,
Jack
easily
managed
to
break
away
from
them
.
 
<EOS>
Without
an
idea
where
he
was
going
,
Jack
pursued
his
way
through
the
fields
;
and
,
as
he
proceeded
,
the
numbness
of
his
limbs
in
some
degree
wore
off
,
and
his
confidence
returned
.
<EOS>
He
had
need
of
all
the
inexhaustible
energy
of
his
character
to
support
him
through
his
toilsome
walk
over
the
wet
grass
,
or
along
the
slippery
ploughed
land
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
he
got
into
a
lane
,
but
had
not
proceeded
far
when
he
was
again
alarmed
by
the
sound
of
a
horse
's
tread
.
 
<EOS>
Once
more
breaking
through
the
hedge
he
took
to
the
fields
.
<EOS>
He
was
now
almost
driven
to
despair
.
<EOS>
Wet
as
he
was
,
he
felt
if
he
lay
down
in
the
grass
,
he
should
perish
with
cold
;
while
,
if
he
sought
a
night
's
lodging
in
any
asylum
,
his
dress
,
stained
with
blood
and
covered
with
dirt
,
would
infallibly
cause
him
to
be
secured
and
delivered
into
the
hands
of
justice
.
<EOS>
And
then
the
fetters
,
which
were
still
upon
his
legs:--how
was
he
to
get
rid
of
them
?
 
<EOS>
Tired
and
dispirited
,
he
still
wandered
on
.
<EOS>
Again
returning
to
the
main
road
,
he
passed
through
Clapton
;
and
turning
off
on
the
left
,
arrived
at
the
foot
of
Stamford
Hill
.
<EOS>
He
walked
on
for
an
hour
longer
,
till
he
could
scarcely
drag
one
leg
after
another
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
he
fell
down
on
the
road
,
fully
expecting
each
moment
would
prove
his
last
.
 
<EOS>
How
long
he
continued
thus
he
scarcely
knew
;
but
just
before
dawn
,
he
managed
to
regain
his
legs
,
and
,
crawling
up
a
bank
,
perceived
he
was
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
Tottenham
.
<EOS>
A
short
way
off
in
the
fields
he
descried
a
sort
of
shed
or
cow
-
house
,
<EOS>
and
thither
he
contrived
to
drag
his
weary
limbs
.
<EOS>
Opening
the
door
,
he
found
it
littered
with
straw
,
on
which
he
threw
himself
,
and
instantly
fell
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
awoke
it
was
late
in
the
day
,
and
raining
heavily
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
he
could
not
stir
,
but
felt
sick
and
exhausted
.
<EOS>
His
legs
were
dreadfully
swelled
;
his
hands
bruised
;
and
his
fetters
occasioned
him
intolerable
pain
.
<EOS>
His
bodily
suffering
,
however
,
was
nothing
compared
with
his
mental
anguish
.
<EOS>
All
the
events
of
the
previous
day
rushed
to
his
recollection
;
and
though
he
had
been
unintentionally
the
cause
of
his
mother
's
death
,
he
reproached
himself
as
severely
as
if
he
had
been
her
actual
murderer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Had
I
not
been
the
guilty
wretch
I
am
,
"
he
cried
,
bursting
into
an
agony
of
tears
,
"
she
would
never
have
died
thus
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
This
strong
feeling
of
remorse
having
found
a
natural
vent
,
in
some
degree
subsided
,
and
he
addressed
himself
to
his
present
situation
.
<EOS>
Rousing
himself
,
he
went
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
It
had
ceased
raining
,
but
the
atmosphere
was
moist
and
chill
,
and
the
ground
deluged
by
the
recent
showers
.
<EOS>
Taking
up
a
couple
of
large
stones
which
lay
near
,
Jack
tried
to
beat
the
round
basils
of
the
fetters
into
an
oval
form
,
so
as
to
enable
him
to
slip
his
heels
through
them
.
 
<EOS>
While
he
was
thus
employed
a
farming
man
came
into
the
barn
.
<EOS>
Jack
instantly
started
to
his
feet
,
and
the
man
,
alarmed
at
his
appearance
,
ran
off
to
a
neighbouring
house
.
<EOS>
Before
he
could
return
,
Jack
had
made
good
his
retreat
;
and
,
wandering
about
the
lanes
and
hedges
,
kept
out
of
sight
as
much
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
On
examining
his
pockets
,
he
found
about
twenty
guineas
in
gold
,
and
some
silver
.
<EOS>
But
how
to
avail
himself
of
it
was
the
question
,
for
in
his
present
garb
he
was
sure
to
be
recognised
.
<EOS>
When
night
fell
,
he
crept
into
the
town
of
Tottenham
.
<EOS>
As
he
passed
along
the
main
thoroughfare
,
he
heard
his
own
name
pronounced
,
and
found
that
it
was
a
hawker
,
crying
a
penny
history
of
his
escapes
.
<EOS>
A
crowd
was
collected
round
the
fellow
,
who
was
rapidly
disposing
of
his
stock
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
's
the
full
,
true
,
and
particular

the
Castle

bawled
the
hawker
,
"
with
a
print
of
him
taken
from
the
life
,
showing
the
manner
,
how
he
was
shackled
and
handcuffed
.
<EOS>
Only
one
penny

two

two
pence

you
,
Sir

<EOS>
Here
's
the----
<EOS>
"
 
"
Let
me
have
one
,
"
cried
a
servant
maid
,
running
across
the
street
,
and
in
her
haste
forgetting
to
shut
the
door,--"here
's
the
money
.
<EOS>
Master
and
missis
have
been
talking
all
day
long
about
Jack
Sheppard
,
and
I
'm
dying
to
read
his
life
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Here
you
have
it
,
my
dear

"
returned
the
hawker
.
<EOS>
"
Sold

"
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
n't
get
back
quickly
,
Lucy
,
"
observed
a
bystander
,
"
Jack
Sheppard
will
be
in
the
house
before
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
sally
occasioned
a
general
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
Jack
would
come
to
my
house
,
I
'd
contrive
to
hide
him
,
"
remarked
a
buxom
dame
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
I
'm
glad
he
has
escaped
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Jack
seems
to
be
a
great
favourite
with
the
fair
sex
,
"
observed
a
smirking
grocer
's
apprentice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
rejoined
the
bystander
,
who
had
just
spoken
,
and
who
was
of
a
cynical
turn,--"the
greater
<EOS>
the
rascal
,
the
better
they
like
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Here
's
a
particular
account
of
Jack
's
many
robberies
and
escapes
,
"
roared
the
hawker,--"how
he
broke
into
the
house
of
his
master
,
Mr.
Wood
,
at
Dollis
<EOS>
Hill--
<EOS>
"
 
"
Let
me
have
one
,
"
said
a
carpenter
,
who
was
passing
by
at
the
moment,--"Mr
.
<EOS>
Wood
was
an
old
friend
of
mine
--
and
I
recollect
seeing
Jack
when
he
was
bound
'
prentice
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
A
penny
,
if
you
please
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
hawker.--"Sold
again
!
<EOS>
Here
you
have
the
full
,
true
,
and
particular
account
of
the
barbarous
murder
committed
by
Jack
Sheppard
and
his
associate
,
Joseph
Blake
,
_
alias
<EOS>
_
Blueskin
,
upon
the
body
of
Mrs.
Wood--
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
false
!
"
<EOS>
cried
a
voice
behind
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
turned
at
the
exclamation
,
and
so
did
several
of
the
bystanders
;
but
they
could
not
make
out
who
had
uttered
it
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
,
who
had
been
lingering
near
the
group
,
now
walked
on
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
middle
of
the
little
town
stood
the
shop
of
a
Jew
dealer
in
old
clothes
.
<EOS>
The
owner
was
at
the
door
unhooking
a
few
articles
of
wearing
apparel
which
he
had
exposed
outside
for
sale
.
<EOS>
Amongst
other
things
,
he
had
just
brought
down
an
old
laced
bavaroy
,
a
species
of
surtout
much
worn
at
the
period
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
fot
that
coat
,
friend
?
"
asked
Jack
,
as
he
came
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
More
than
you
'll
pay
for
it
,
friend
,
"
snuffled
the
Jew
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
know
that
?
"
rejoined
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
take
a
guinea
for
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Double
that
sum
might
tempt
me
,
"
replied
the
Jew
;
"
it
's
a
nobleman
's
coat
,
upon
my
shoul
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Here
's
the
money
,
"
replied
Jack
,
taking
the
coat
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
help
you
on
with
it
,
Sir
?
<EOS>
"
replied
the
Jew
,
becoming
suddenly
respectful
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
half
suspect
this
is
a
highwayman
,
"
thought
the
Jew
;
"
he
's
so
ready
with
his
cash
.
<EOS>
I
've
some
other
things
inside
,
Sir
,
which
you
might
wish
to
buy,--some
pistols
.
"
 
<EOS>
Jack
was
about
to
comply
;
but
not
liking
the
man
's
manner
,
he
walked
on
.
 
<EOS>
Further
on
,
there
was
a
small
chandler
's
shop
,
where
Jack
observed
an
old
woman
seated
at
the
counter
,
attended
by
a
little
girl
.
<EOS>
Seeing
provisions
in
the
window
,
Jack
ventured
in
and
bought
a
loaf
.
<EOS>
Having
secured
this,--for
<EOS>
he
was
almost
famished,--he
said
that
he
had
lost
a
hammer
and
wished
to
purchase
one
.
<EOS>
The
old
woman
told
him
she
had
no
such
article
to
dispose
of
,
but
recommended
him
to
a
neighbouring
blacksmith
.
 
<EOS>
Guided
by
the
glare
of
the
forge
,
which
threw
a
stream
of
ruddy
light
across
the
road
,
Jack
soon
found
the
place
of
which
he
was
in
search
.
<EOS>
Entering
the
workshop
,
he
found
the
blacksmith
occupied
in
heating
the
tire
of
a
cart
wheel
.
<EOS>
Suspending
his
labour
on
Jack
's
appearance
,
the
man
demanded
his
business
.
<EOS>
Making
up
a
similar
story
to
that
which
he
had
told
the
old
woman
,
he
said
he
wanted
to
purchase
a
hammer
and
a
file
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
looked
hard
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Answer
me
one
question
first
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
;
"
I
half
suspect
you
're
Jack
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
,
"
replied
Jack
,
without
hesitation
;
<EOS>
for
he
felt
assured
from
the
man
's
manner
that
he
might
confide
in
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
bold
fellow
,
Jack
,
"
rejoined
the
blacksmith
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
've
done
well
to
trust
me
.
<EOS>
I
'll
take
off
your
irons
--
for
I
guess
that
's
the
reason
why
you
want
the
hammer
and
file
--
on
one
condition
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
you
give
'em
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Readily
.
"
 
<EOS>
Taking
Jack
into
a
shed
behind
the
workshop
the
smith
in
a
short
time
freed
him
from
his
fetters
.
<EOS>
He
not
only
did
this
,
but
supplied
him
with
an
ointment
which
allayed
the
swelling
of
his
limbs
,
and
crowned
all
by
furnishing
him
with
a
jug
of
excellent
ale
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid
,
Jack
,
you
'll
come
to
the
gallows
,
"
observed
the
smith
;
"
buth
<EOS>
if
you
do
,
I
'll
go
to
Tyburn
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
never
part
with
your
irons
.
"
 
<EOS>
Noticing
the
draggled
condition
Jack
was
in
<EOS>
,
he
then
fetched
him
a
bucket
of
water
,
with
which
Jack
cleansed
himself
as
well
as
he
could
,
and
thanking
the
honest
smith
,
who
would
take
nothing
for
his
trouble
,
left
the
shop
.
 
<EOS>
Having
made
a
tolerably
good
meal
upon
the
loaf
,
overcome
by
fatigue
,
Jack
turned
into
a
barn
in
Stoke
Newington
,
and
slept
till
late
in
the
day
,
when
he
awakened
much
refreshed
.
<EOS>
The
swelling
in
his
limbs
had
also
subsided
.
<EOS>
It
rained
heavily
all
day
,
so
he
did
not
stir
forth
.
 
<EOS>
Towards
night
,
however
,
he
ventured
out
,
and
walked
on
towards
London
.
<EOS>
When
he
arrived
at
Hoxton
,
he
found
the
walls
covered
with
placards
offering
a
reward
for
his
apprehension
,
and
he
everywhere
appeared
to
be
the
general
subject
of
conversation
.
<EOS>
Prom
a
knot
of
idlers
at
a
public
-
house
,
he
learnt
that
Jonathan
Wild
had
just
ridden
past
,
and
that
his
setters
were
scouring
the
country
in
every
direction
.
 
<EOS>
Entering
London
,
he
bent
his
way
towards
the
west
-
end
;
and
having
some
knowledge
of
a
secondhand
tailor
's
shop
in
Rupert
Street
,
proceeded
thither
,
and
looked
out
a
handsome
suit
of
mourning
,
with
a
sword
,
cloak
,
and
hat
,
and
demanded
the
price
.
<EOS>
The
man
asked
twelve
guineas
,
but
after
a
little
bargaining
,
he
came
down
to
ten
.
 
<EOS>
Taking
his
new
purchase
under
his
arm
,
Jack
proceeded
to
a
small
tavern
in
the
same
street
,
where
,
having
ordered
dinner
,
he
went
to
a
bed
-
room
to
attire
himself
.
<EOS>
He
had
scarcely
completed
his
toilet
,
when
he
was
startled
by
a
noise
at
the
door
,
and
heard
his
own
name
pronounced
in
no
friendly
accents
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
,
the
window
was
not
far
from
the
ground
;
so
opening
it
gently
,
he
dropped
into
a
backyard
,
and
from
thence
got
into
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
Hurrying
down
the
Haymarket
,
he
was
arrested
by
a
crowd
who
were
collected
round
a
street
-
singer
.
<EOS>
Jack
paused
for
a
moment
,
and
found
that
his
own
adventures
formed
the
subject
of
the
ballad
.
<EOS>
Not
daring
,
however
,
to
listen
to
it
,
he
ran
on
.

CHAPTER
XXVI
.
 
<EOS>
How
Jack
Sheppard
attended
his
Mother
's
Funeral
.
  
<EOS>
That
night
Jack
walked
to
Paddington
,
and
took
up
his
quarters
at
a
small
tavern
,
called
the
Wheat
-
sheaf
,
near
the
green
.
<EOS>
On
the
next
morning
--
Sunday
--
the
day
on
which
he
expected
his
mother
's
funeral
to
take
place
,
he
set
out
along
the
Harrow
Road
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
clear
,
lovely
,
October
morning
.
<EOS>
The
air
was
sharp
and
bracing
,
and
the
leaves
which
had
taken
their
autumnal
tints
were
falling
from
the
trees
.
<EOS>
The
road
which
wound
by
Westbourne
Green
,
gave
him
a
full
view
of
the
hill
of
Hampstead
with
its
church
,
its
crest
of
houses
,
and
its
villas
peeping
from
out
the
trees
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
's
heart
was
too
full
to
allow
him
to
derive
any
pleasure
from
this
scene
;
so
he
strolled
on
without
raising
his
eyes
till
he
arrived
at
Kensal
Green
.
<EOS>
Here
he
obtained
some
breakfast
,
and
mounting
the
hill
turned
off
into
the
fields
on
the
right
.
<EOS>
Crossing
them
,
he
ascended
an
eminence
,
which
,
from
its
singular
shape
,
seems
to
have
been
the
site
of
a
Roman
encampment
,
and
which
commands
a
magnificent
prospect
.
 
<EOS>
Leaning
upon
a
gate
he
looked
down
into
the
valley
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
very
spot
from
which
his
poor
mother
had
gazed
after
her
vain
attempt
to
rescue
him
at
the
Mint
;
but
,
though
he
was
ignorant
of
this
,
her
image
was
alone
present
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
beheld
the
grey
tower
of
Willesden
Church
,
embosomed
in
its
grove
of
trees
,
now
clothed
,
in
all
the
glowing
livery
of
autumn
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
cottage
she
had
inhabited
for
so
many
years,--in
<EOS>
those
fields
she
had
rambled,--at
that
church
she
had
prayed
.
<EOS>
And
he
had
destroyed
all
this
.
<EOS>
But
for
him
she
might
have
been
alive
and
happy
.
<EOS>
The
recollection
was
too
painful
,
and
he
burst
into
an
agony
of
tears
.
 
<EOS>
Aroused
by
the
sound
of
the
church
bells
,
he
resolved
,
at
whatever
risk
,
to
attend
Divine
service
.
<EOS>
With
this
view
,
he
descended
the
hill
and
presently
found
a
footpath
leading
to
the
church
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
destined
to
have
every
tide
of
feeling
awakened
--
every
wound
opened
.
<EOS>
The
path
he
had
selected
conducted
him
to
his
mother
's
humble
dwelling
.
<EOS>
When
she
occupied
,
it
,
it
was
neatness
itself
;
the
little
porch
was
overrun
with
creepers
--
the
garden
trim
and
exquisitely
kept
.
<EOS>
Now
,
it
was
a
wilderness
of
weeds
.
<EOS>
The
glass
in
the
windows
was
broken
--
the
roof
unthatched
--
<EOS>
the
walls
dilapidated
.
<EOS>
Jack
turned
away
with
an
aching
heart
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
an
emblem
of
the
ruin
he
had
caused
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
proceeded
,
other
painful
reminiscences
were
aroused
.
<EOS>
At
every
step
he
seemed
to
be
haunted
by
the
ghost
of
the
past
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
stile
on
which
Jonathan
had
sat
,
and
he
recollected
distinctly
the
effect
of
his
mocking
glance
--
how
it
had
hardened
his
heart
against
his
mother
's
prayer
.
"
<EOS>
O
God
!
<EOS>
"
he
exclaimed
,
"
I
am
severely
punished
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
had
now
gained
the
high
road
.
<EOS>
The
villagers
were
thronging
to
church
.
<EOS>
Bounding
the
corner
of
a
garden
wall
,
he
came
upon
his
former
place
of
imprisonment
.
<EOS>
Some
rustic
hand
had
written
upon
the
door
"
<EOS>
JACK
SHEPPARD
'S
CAGE
;
"
and
upon
the
wall
was
affixed
a
large
placard
describing
his
person
,
and
offering
a
reward
for
his
capture
.
<EOS>
Muffling
up
his
face
,
Jack
turned
away
;
but
he
had
not
proceeded
many
steps
when
he
heard
a
man
reading
aloud
an
account
of
his
escapes
from
a
newspaper
.
 
<EOS>
Hastening
to
the
church
,
he
entered
it
by
the
very
door
near
which
his
first
crime
had
been
committed
.
<EOS>
His
mother
's
scream
seemed
again
to
ring
in
his
ears
,
and
he
was
so
deeply
affected
that
,
fearful
of
exciting
attention
,
he
was
about
to
quit
the
sacred
edifice
,
when
he
was
stopped
by
the
entrance
of
Thames
,
who
looked
pale
as
death
,
with
Winifred
leaning
on
his
arm
.
<EOS>
They
were
followed
by
Mr.
Wood
in
the
deepest
mourning
.
 
<EOS>
Shrinking
involuntarily
back
into
the
farthest
corner
of
the
seat
,
Jack
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
.
<EOS>
The
service
began
.
<EOS>
Jack
who
had
not
been
in
a
place
of
worship
for
many
years
was
powerfully
affected
.
<EOS>
Accidentally
raising
his
eyes
,
he
saw
that
he
was
perceived
by
the
family
from
Dollis
Hill
,
and
that
he
was
an
object
of
the
deepest
interest
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
service
was
over
,
Thames
contrived
to
approach
him
,
and
whispered
,
"
Be
cautious,--the
funeral
will
take
place
after
evening
service
.
"
 
<EOS>
Jack
would
not
hazard
a
glance
at
Winifred
;
but
,
quitting
the
church
,
got
into
an
adjoining
meadow
,
and
watched
the
party
slowly
ascending
the
road
leading
to
Dollis
Hill
.
<EOS>
At
a
turn
in
the
road
,
he
perceived
Winifred
looking
anxiously
towards
him
,
and
when
she
discovered
him
,
she
waved
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Returning
to
the
churchyard
,
he
walked
round
it
;
and
on
the
western
side
,
near
a
small
yew
-
tree
discovered
a
new
-
made
grave
.
 
<EOS>
"
Whose
grave
is
this
?
"
<EOS>
he
inquired
of
a
man
who
was
standing
near
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
say
,
"
answered
the
fellow
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
'll
inquire
from
the
sexton
,
William
Morgan
.
<EOS>
Here
,
Peter
,
"
he
added
to
a
curly
-
headed
lad
,
who
was
playing
on
one
of
the
grassy
tombs
,
"
ask
your
father
to
step
this
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
little
urchin
set
off
,
and
presently
returned
with
the
sexton
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
Mrs.
Sheppard
's
grave,--the
mother
of
the
famous
housebreaker
,
"
said
Morgan
,
in
answer
to
Jack
's
inquiry;--"and
<EOS>
it
's
well
<EOS>
they
let
her
have
Christian
burial
after
all
--
for
they
say
she
destroyed
herself
for
her
son
.
<EOS>
The
crowner
's
'
quest
sat
on
her
yesterday
--
and
if
she
had
n't
been
proved
out
of
her
mind
,
she
would
have
been
buried
at
four
lane
-
ends
.
"
 
<EOS>
Jack
could
stand
no
more
.
<EOS>
Placing
a
piece
of
money
in
Morgan
's
hands
,
he
hurried
out
of
the
churchyard
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
my
soul
,
"
said
the
sexton
,
"
that
's
as
like
Jack
Sheppard
as
any
one
I
ever
seed
<EOS>
i
'
my
born
days
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Hastening
to
the
Six
Bells
,
Jack
ordered
some
refreshment
,
and
engaged
a
private
room
,
where
he
remained
till
the
afternoon
absorbed
in
grief
.
 
<EOS>
Meantime
,
a
change
had
taken
place
in
the
weather
.
<EOS>
The
day
had
become
suddenly
overcast
.
<EOS>
The
wind
blew
in
fitful
gusts
,
and
scattered
the
yellow
leaves
from
the
elms
and
horse
-
chestnuts
.
<EOS>
Roused
by
the
bell
tolling
for
evening
service
,
Jack
left
the
house
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
the
churchyard
,
he
perceived
the
melancholy
procession
descending
the
hill
.
<EOS>
Just
then
,
a
carriage
drawn
by
four
horses
,
drove
furiously
up
to
the
Six
Bells
;
but
Jack
was
too
much
absorbed
to
take
any
notice
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
the
bell
began
to
toll
in
a
peculiar
manner
,
announcing
the
approach
of
the
corpse
.
<EOS>
The
gate
was
opened
;
the
coffin
brought
into
the
churchyard
;
and
Jack
,
whose
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
,
saw
Mr.
Wood
and
Thames
pass
him
,
and
followed
at
a
foot
's
pace
behind
them
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
clergyman
,
bare
-
headed
and
in
his
surplice
,
advanced
to
meet
them
.
<EOS>
Having
read
the
three
first
verses
of
the
impressive
service
appointed
for
the
burial
of
the
dead
,
he
returned
to
the
church
,
whither
the
coffin
was
carried
through
the
south
-
western
door
,
and
placed
in
the
centre
of
the
aisle
--
Mr
.
Wood
and
Thames
taking
their
places
on
either
side
of
it
,
and
Jack
at
a
little
distance
behind
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
had
been
touched
in
the
morning
,
but
he
was
now
completely
prostrated
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
the
holy
place
,
which
he
had
formerly
profaned
,
lay
the
body
of
his
unfortunate
mother
,
and
he
could
not
help
looking
upon
her
untimely
end
as
the
retributive
vengeance
of
Heaven
for
the
crime
he
had
committed
.
<EOS>
His
grief
was
so
audible
,
that
it
attracted
the
notice
of
some
of
the
bystanders
,
and
Thames
was
obliged
to
beg
him
to
control
it
.
<EOS>
In
doing
this
,
he
chanced
to
raise
his
eyes
and
half
fancied
he
beheld
,
shaded
by
a
pillar
at
the
extremity
of
the
western
aisle
,
the
horrible
countenance
of
the
thief
-
taker
.
 
<EOS>
Before
the
congregation
separated
,
the
clergyman
descended
from
the
pulpit
;
and
,
followed
by
the
coffin
-
bearers
and
mourners
,
and
by
Jack
at
a
respectful
distance
,
entered
the
churchyard
.
 
<EOS>
The
carriage
,
which
it
has
been
mentioned
drove
up
to
the
Six
Bells
,
contained
four
persons,--Jonathan
Wild
,
his
two
janizaries
,
and
his
porter
,
Obadiah
Lemon
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
they
had
got
out
,
the
vehicle
was
drawn
up
at
the
back
of
a
tree
near
the
cage
.
<EOS>
Having
watched
the
funeral
at
some
distance
,
Jonathan
fancied
he
could
discern
the
figure
of
Jack
;
but
not
being
quite
sure
,
he
entered
the
church
.
<EOS>
He
was
daring
enough
to
have
seized
and
carried
him
off
before
the
whole
congregation
,
but
he
preferred
waiting
.
 
<EOS>
Satisfied
with
his
scrutiny
,
he
returned
,
despatched
Abraham
and
Obadiah
to
the
northwest
corner
of
the
church
,
placed
Quilt
behind
a
buttress
near
the
porch
,
and
sheltered
himself
behind
one
of
the
mighty
elms
.
 
<EOS>
The
funeral
procession
had
now
approached
the
grave
,
around
which
many
of
the
congregation
,
who
were
deeply
interested
by
the
sad
ceremonial
,
had
gathered
.
<EOS>
A
slight
rain
fell
at
the
time
;
and
a
few
leaves
,
caught
by
the
eddies
,
whirled
around
.
<EOS>
Jonathan
mixed
with
the
group
,
and
,
sure
of
his
prey
,
abided
his
time
.
 
<EOS>
The
clergyman
,
meanwhile
,
proceeded
with
the
service
,
while
the
coffin
was
deposited
at
the
brink
of
the
grave
.
 
<EOS>
Just
as
the
attendants
were
preparing
to
lower
the
corpse
into
the
earth
,
Jack
fell
on
his
knees
beside
the
coffin
,
uttering
the
wildest
exclamations
of
grief
,
reproaching
himself
with
the
murder
of
his
mother
,
and
invoking
the
vengeance
of
Heaven
on
his
own
head
.
 
<EOS>
A
murmur
ran
through
the
assemblage
,
by
several
of
whom
Jack
was
recognised
.
<EOS>
But
such
was
the
violence
of
his
grief,--such
the
compunction
he
exhibited
,
that
all
but
one
looked
on
with
an
eye
of
compassion
.
<EOS>
That
person
advanced
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
killed
her
,
"
cried
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
,
"
rejoined
Jonathan
,
laying
a
forcible
grasp
on
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
my
prisoner
.
"
 
<EOS>
Jack
started
to
his
feet
;
but
before
he
could
defend
himself
,
his
right
arm
was
grasped
by
the
Jew
who
had
silently
approached
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hell
-
hounds
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
;
"
release
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
At
the
same
moment
,
Quilt
Arnold
rushed
forward
with
such
haste
,
that
,
stumbling
over
William
Morgan
,
he
precipitated
him
into
the
grave
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wretch
!
"
cried
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Are
you
not
content
with
the
crimes
you
have
<EOS>
committed,--but
<EOS>
you
must
carry
your
villany
to
this
point
.
<EOS>
Look
at
the
poor
victim
at
your
feet
.
"
 
<EOS>
Jonathan
made
no
reply
,
but
ordered
his
myrmidons
to
drag
the
prisoner
along
.
 
<EOS>
Thames
,
meanwhile
,
had
drawn
his
sword
,
and
was
about
to
rush
upon
Jonathan
;
but
he
was
withheld
by
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
shed
more
blood
,
"
cried
the
carpenter
.
 
<EOS>
Groans
and
hoots
were
now
raised
by
the
crowd
,
and
there
was
an
evident
disposition
to
rescue
.
<EOS>
A
small
brickbat
was
thrown
,
which
struck
Jonathan
in
the
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
pass
,
"
cried
several
of
the
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
knew
his
poor
mother
,
and
for
her
sake
I
'll
not
see
this
done
,
"
cried
John
Dump
.
 
<EOS>
"
Slip
on
the
handcuffs
,
"
cried
the
thief
-
taker
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
let
's
see
who
'll
dare
to
oppose
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
Jonathan
Wild
.
<EOS>
I
have
arrested
him
in
the
King
's
name
.
"
 
<EOS>
A
deep
indignant
groan
followed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
the
earth
thrown
over
her
,
"
implored
Jack
;
"
and
take
me
where
you
please
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
thundered
Wild
.
 
<EOS>
"
Allow
him
that
small
grace
,
"
cried
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
tell
you
,
"
rejoined
Jonathan
,
shouldering
his
way
out
of
the
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
mother,--my
poor
mother
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
in
spite
of
his
outcries
and
resistance
,
he
was
dragged
along
by
Jonathan
and
his
janizaries
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
eastern
gate
of
the
churchyard
stood
the
carriage
with
the
steps
lowered
.
<EOS>
The
mob
pursued
the
thief
-
taker
and
his
party
all
the
way
,
and
such
missiles
as
could
be
collected
were
hurled
at
them
.
<EOS>
They
even
threatened
to
cut
the
traces
and
take
off
the
wheels
from
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
The
Jew
got
in
first
.
<EOS>
The
prisoner
was
then
thrust
in
by
Quilt
.
<EOS>
Before
Jonathan
followed
he
turned
to
face
his
assailants
.
 
<EOS>
"
Back
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
an
officer
in
the
execution
of
my
duty
.
<EOS>
And
he
who
opposes
me
in
it
shall
feel
the
weight
of
my
hand
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
then
sprung
into
the
coach
,
the
door
of
which
was
closed
by
Obadiah
,
who
mounted
the
box
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
Newgate
,
"
cried
Jonathan
,
putting
his
head
out
of
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
A
deep
roar
followed
this
order
,
and
several
missiles
were
launched
at
the
vehicle
,
which
was
driven
off
at
a
furious
pace
.
 
<EOS>
And
while
her
son
was
reconveyed
to
prison
the
body
of
the
unfortunate
Mrs.
Sheppard
was
committed
to
the
earth
.

Jack

's

the
night
of
the
15th
of
October
was
not
discovered
till
the
following
morning
;
for
although
the
intelligence
was
brought
by
several
parties
to
the
Lodge
in
the
course
of
the
night
,
Austin
,
who
was
the
officer
in
attendance
,
paid
no
attention
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
After
pursuing
the
fugitive
as
before
related
,
Jonathan
Wild
returned
to
his
own
habitation
,
where
he
was
occupied
during
the
remainder
of
the
night
with
Quilt
Arnold
and
Obadiah
Lemon
in
removing
everything
which
,
in
case
of
a
search
,
might
tend
to
criminate
him
.
<EOS>
Satisfied
in
this
respect
,
he
flung
himself
into
a
chair
,
for
his
iron
frame
seldom
required
the
indulgence
of
a
bed
,
and
sought
an
hour
's
repose
before
he
began
the
villanies
of
another
day
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
aroused
from
his
slumber
,
about
six
o'clock
,
by
the
return
of
Abraham
Mendez
,
who
not
choosing
to
confess
that
Jack
had
eluded
his
vigilance
,
contended
himself
with
stating
that
he
had
kept
watch
till
daybreak
,
when
he
had
carefully
searched
the
field
,
and
,
finding
no
trace
of
him
,
had
thought
it
better
to
return
.
 
<EOS>
This
information
was
received
by
Jonathan
with
a
lowering
brow
.
<EOS>
He
comforted
himself
,
however
,
with
the
certainty
which
he
felt
of
capturing
his
prey
on
the
Sunday
.
<EOS>
His
breakfast
despatched
,
which
he
ate
with
a
wolfish
appetite
,
he
walked
over
to
Newgate
,
chuckling
as
he
went
at
the
consternation
which
his
appearance
would
create
amongst
the
turnkeys
.
 
<EOS>
Entering
the
Lodge
,
the
first
person
he
beheld
was
Austin
,
who
was
only
just
up
,
and
whose
toilette
appeared
scarcely
completed
.
<EOS>
A
glance
satisfied
Jonathan
that
the
turnkey
was
not
aware
of
the
prisoner
's
escape
;
and
he
resolved
not
to
destroy
what
he
considered
a
good
jest
,
by
a
premature
disclosure
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
out
betimes
this
morning
,
Mr.
Wild
,
"
observed
Austin
,
as
he
put
on
his
coat
,
and
adjusted
his
minor
bob
.
<EOS>
"
Something
fresh
on
hand
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
come
to
inquire
after
Jack
Sheppard
,
"
returned
Jonathan
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
alarm
yourself
about
him
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Austin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
safe
enough
,
I
assure
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
satisfy
myself
on
that
score
,
"
rejoined
Wild
,
drily
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
you
shall
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Austin
,
who
at
this
moment
recollected
,
with
some
uneasiness
,
the
applications
at
the
lodge
-
door
during
the
night
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
do
n't
imagine
anything
has
gone
wrong
,
Sir
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
matters
not
what
I
think
,
"
replied
Wild
.
<EOS>
"
Come
with
me
to
the
Castle
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Instantly
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Austin
;
"
instantly
.
<EOS>
Here
,
Caliban
,
attend
to
the
door
,
and
keep
the
wicket
locked
till
I
return
.
<EOS>
D'ye
hear
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Taking
the
keys
,
he
led
the
way
,
followed
by
Jonathan
,
who
chuckled
internally
at
the
shock
that
awaited
the
poor
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
The
door
was
opened
,
and
Austin
entered
the
cell
,
when
he
absolutely
recoiled
before
the
spectacle
he
beheld
,
and
could
scarcely
have
looked
more
alarmed
if
the
prison
had
tumbled
about
his
ears
.
<EOS>
Petrified
and
speechless
<EOS>
,
he
turned
an
imploring
look
at
Wild
,
who
was
himself
filled
with
astonishment
at
the
pile
of
rubbish
lying
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Sdeath
!
"
cried
Jonathan
,
staring
at
the
breach
in
the
wall
.
<EOS>
"
Some
one
_
must
_
have
assisted
him
.
<EOS>
Unless
he
has
dealings
with
the
devil
,
he
could
never
have
done
this
alone
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
firmly
believe
he
_
has
_
dealings
with
the
devil
,
"
replied
Austin
,
trembling
from
head
to
foot
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
perhaps
,
he
has
not
got
beyond
the
room
above
.
<EOS>
It
's
as
strong
,
if
not
stronger
,
than
this
.
<EOS>
I
'll
see
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
scrambled
over
the
rubbish
,
and
got
into
the
chimney
.
<EOS>
But
though
the
breach
was
large
enough
to
admit
him
below
,
he
could
not
squeeze
his
bulky
person
through
the
aperture
into
the
Red
Room
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
believe
he
's
gone
,
"
he
said
,
returning
to
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
door
's
open
,
and
the
room
empty
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
believe
--
you
_
know
_
it
,
"
replied
Jonathan
,
fixing
one
of
his
sternest
and
most
searching
glances
upon
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nothing
you
can
say
to
the
contrary
will
convince
me
that
you
have
not
been
accessory
to
his
flight
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
,
Sir!--I
swear----
"
 
"
Tush
!
"
<EOS>
interrupted
Jonathan
,
harshly
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
state
my
suspicions
to
the
governor
.
<EOS>
Come
down
with
me
to
the
Lodge
directly
.
<EOS>
All
further
examinations
must
be
conducted
in
the
presence
of
proper
witnesses
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
he
strode
out
of
the
room
,
darted
down
the
stone
stairs
,
and
,
on
his
arrival
at
the
Lodge
,
seized
the
rope
of
the
great
bell
communicating
with
the
interior
of
the
prison
,
which
he
rang
violently
.
<EOS>
As
this
was
never
done
,
except
in
some
case
of
great
emergency
,
the
application
was
instantly
answered
by
all
the
other
turnkeys
,
by
Marvel
,
the
four
partners
,
and
Mrs.
Spurling
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
exceed
the
dismay
of
these
personages
when
they
learnt
why
they
had
been
summoned
.
<EOS>
All
seemed
infected
with
Austin
's
terrors
except
Mrs.
Spurling
,
who
did
not
dare
to
exhibit
her
satisfaction
otherwise
than
by
privately
pinching
the
arm
of
her
expected
husband
.
 
<EOS>
Headed
by
Jonathan
,
all
the
turnkeys
then
repaired
to
the
upper
part
of
the
jail
,
and
,
approaching
the
Red
Room
by
a
circuitous
route
,
several
doors
were
unlocked
,
and
they
came
upon
the
scene
of
Jack
's
exploits
.
<EOS>
Stopping
before
each
door
,
they
took
up
the
plates
of
the
locks
,
examined
the
ponderous
bolts
,
and
were
struck
with
the
utmost
astonishment
at
what
they
beheld
.
 
<EOS>
Arriving
at
the
chapel
,
their
wonder
increased
.
<EOS>
All
the
jailers
declared
it
utterly
impossible
he
could
have
accomplished
his
astonishing
task
unaided
;
but
who
had
lent
him
assistance
was
a
question
they
were
unable
to
answer
.
<EOS>
Proceeding
to
the
entry
to
the
Lower
Leads
,
they
came
to
the
two
strong
doors
,
and
their
surprise
was
so
great
at
Jack
's
marvellous
performance
,
that
they
could
scarcely
persuade
themselves
that
human
ingenuity
could
have
accomplished
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
's
a
door
,
"
remarked
Ireton
,
when
he
got
to
that
nearest
the
leads
,
"
which
I
could
have
sworn
would
have
resisted
anything
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
no
faith
in
future
in
bolts
and
bars
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mounting
the
roof
of
the
prison
,
they
traced
the
fugitive
's
course
to
the
further
extremity
of
the
building
,
where
they
found
his
blanket
attached
to
the
spike
proving
that
he
escaped
in
that
direction
.
 
<EOS>
After
severely
examining
Austin
,
and
finding
it
proved
,
on
the
testimony
of
his
fellow
-
jailers
,
that
he
could
not
have
aided
Jack
in
his
flight
,
Jonathan
retracted
his
harsh
sentence
,
and
even
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
he
would
act
as
mediator
between
him
and
the
governor
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
some
satisfaction
to
the
poor
fellow
,
who
was
dreadfully
frightened
,
as
indeed
he
might
well
be
,
it
being
the
opinion
of
the
jailers
and
others
who
afterwards
examined
the
place
,
that
Jack
had
accomplished
,
single
-
handed
,
in
a
few
hours
,
and
,
as
far
as
it
could
be
ascertained
,
with
imperfect
implements
,
what
it
would
have
taken
half
a
dozen
men
several
days
,
provided
with
proper
tools
,
to
effect
.
<EOS>
In
their
opinion
a
hundred
pounds
would
not
repair
the
damage
done
to
the
prison
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
Jack
's
escape
became
known
,
thousands
of
persons
flocked
to
Newgate
to
behold
his
workmanship
;
and
the
jailers
reaped
am
abundant
harvest
from
their
curiosity
.
 
<EOS>
Jonathan
,
meanwhile
,
maintained
profound
secrecy
as
to
his
hopes
of
capturing
the
fugitive
;
and
when
Jack
was
brought
back
to
Newgate
on
the
Sunday
evening
,
his
arrival
was
wholly
unexpected
.
 
<EOS>
At
a
little
after
five
,
on
that
day
,
four
horses
dashed
round
the
corner
of
the
Old
Bailey
,
and
drew
up
before
the
door
of
the
Lodge
.
<EOS>
Hearing
the
stoppage
,
Austin
rushed
out
,
and
could
scarcely
believe
his
eyes
when
he
beheld
Jack
Sheppard
in
the
custody
of
Quilt
Arnold
and
Abraham
Mendez
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
's
recapture
was
speedily
made
known
to
all
the
officers
of
the
jail
,
and
the
Lodge
was
instantly
crowded
.
<EOS>
The
delight
of
the
turnkeys
was
beyond
all
bounds
;
but
poor
Mrs.
Spurling
was
in
a
state
of
distraction
and
began
to
abuse
Jonathan
so
violently
that
her
future
husband
was
obliged
to
lay
forcible
hands
upon
her
and
drag
her
away
.
 
<EOS>
By
Wild
's
command
the
prisoner
was
taken
to
the
Condemned
Hold
,
whither
he
was
followed
by
the
whole
posse
of
officers
and
by
the
partners
;
two
of
whom
carried
large
hammers
and
two
the
fetters
.
<EOS>
There
was
only
one
prisoner
in
the
ward
.
<EOS>
He
was
chained
to
the
ground
,
but
started
up
at
their
approach
.
<EOS>
It
was
Blueskin
.
<EOS>
When
he
beheld
Jack
he
uttered
a
deep
groan
.
 
<EOS>
"
Captain
,
"
he
cried
,
in
a
voice
of
the
bitterest
anguish
,
"
have
these
dogs
again
hunted
you
down
?
<EOS>
If
you
had
n't
been
so
unlucky
,
I
should
have
been
with
you
before
to
-
morrow
night
.
"
 
<EOS>
Jack
made
no
answer
,
nor
did
he
even
cast
his
eyes
upon
his
follower
.
<EOS>
But
Jonathan
,
fixing
a
terrible
look
upon
him
,
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
say
you
so
?
<EOS>
You
must
be
looked
to
.
<EOS>
My
lads
,
"
he
continued
,
addressing
the
partners
;
"
when
you
've
finished
this
job
give
that
fellow
a
fresh
set
of
darbies
.
<EOS>
I
suspect
he
has
been
at
work
upon
those
he
has
on
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
link
of
the
chain
next
the
staple
is
sawn
through
,
"
said
Ireton
,
stooping
to
examine
Blueskin
's
fetters
.
 
<EOS>
"
Search
him
and
iron
him
afresh
;
"
commanded
Jonathan
.
"
<EOS>
But
first
let
us
secure
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
We
'll
then
remove
them
both
to
the
Middle
Stone
Hold
,
where
a
watch
shall
be
kept
over
them
night
and
day
till
they
're
taken
to
Tyburn
.
<EOS>
As
they
're
so
fond
of
each
other
's
society
<EOS>
they
sha
n't
part
company
even
on
that
occasion
,
but
shall
swing
from
the
same
tree
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
'll
never
live
to
see
that
day
,
"
cried
Blueskin
,
fixing
a
menacing
look
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
weight
are
these
irons
?
"
asked
Jonathan
,
coolly
addressing
one
of
the
partners
.
 
<EOS>
"
More
than
three
hundred
weight
,
Sir
,
"
replied
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
They
're
the
heaviest
set
we
<EOS>
have,--and
were
forged
expressly
for
Captain
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
're
not
half
heavy
enough
,
"
replied
Wild
.
<EOS>
"
Let
him
be
handcuffed
,
and
doubly
ironed
on
both
legs
;
and
when
we
get
him
into
the
Stone
Ward
,
he
shall
not
only
be
chained
down
to
the
ground
,
but
shall
have
two
additional
fetters
running
through
the
main
links
,
fastened
on
each
side
of
him
.
<EOS>
We
'll
see
whether
he
'll
get
rid
of
his
new
bonds
?
<EOS>
"
he
added
with
a
brutal
laugh
,
which
was
echoed
by
the
bystanders
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mark
me
,
"
said
Jack
,
sternly
;
<EOS>
"
I
have
twice
broken
out
of
this
prison
in
spite
of
all
your
precautions
.
<EOS>
And
were
you
to
load
me
with
thrice
<EOS>
the
weight
of
iron
you
have
ordered
you
should
not
prevent
my
escaping
a
third
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
right
,
Captain
,
"
cried
Blueskin
.
<EOS>
"
We
'll
give
them
the
slip
yet
,
and
hang
that
butcherly
thief
-
taker
upon
his
own
gibbet
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Be
silent
dog
,
"
cried
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
And
with
his
clenched
hand
he
struck
him
a
violent
blow
in
the
face
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
,
perhaps
,
in
his
life
,
he
repented
of
his
brutality
.
<EOS>
The
blow
was
scarcely
dealt
,
when
,
with
a
bound
like
that
of
a
tiger
,
Blueskin
sprang
upon
him
.
<EOS>
The
chain
,
which
had
been
partially
cut
through
,
snapped
near
the
staple
.
<EOS>
Before
any
assistance
could
be
rendered
by
the
jailers
,
who
stood
astounded
,
Blueskin
had
got
Wild
in
his
clutches
.
<EOS>
His
strength
has
been
described
as
prodigious
;
but
now
,
heightened
by
his
desire
for
vengeance
,
it
was
irresistible
.
<EOS>
Jonathan
,
though
a
very
powerful
man
,
was
like
an
infant
in
his
gripe
.
<EOS>
Catching
hold
of
his
chin
,
he
bent
back
the
neck
,
while
with
his
left
hand
he
pulled
out
a
clasp
knife
,
which
he
opened
with
his
teeth
,
and
grasping
Wild
's
head
with
his
arm
,
notwithstanding
his
resistance
,
cut
deeply
into
his
throat
.
<EOS>
The
folds
of
a
thick
muslin
neckcloth
in
some
degree
protected
him
,
but
the
gash
was
desperate
.
<EOS>
Blueskin
drew
the
knife
across
his
throat
a
second
time
,
widening
and
deepening
the
wound
;
and
wrenching
back
the
head
to
get
it
into
a
more
favourable
position
,
would
infallibly
have
severed
it
from
the
trunk
,
if
the
officers
,
who
by
this
time
had
recovered
from
their
terror
,
had
not
thrown
themselves
upon
him
,
and
withheld
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
's
your
time
,
"
cried
Blueskin
,
struggling
desperately
with
his
assailants
and
inflicting
severe
cuts
with
his
knife
.
<EOS>
"
Fly
,
Captain
--
fly
!
"
 
<EOS>
Aroused
to
a
sense
of
the
possibility
of
escape
,
Jack
,
who
had
viewed
the
deadly
assault
with
savage
satisfaction
,
burst
from
his
captors
and
made
for
the
door
.
<EOS>
Blueskin
fought
his
way
towards
it
,
and
exerting
all
his
strength
,
cutting
right
and
left
as
he
proceeded
,
reached
it
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
Jack
in
all
probability
,
would
have
escaped
,
if
Langley
,
who
was
left
in
the
Lodge
,
had
not
been
alarmed
at
the
noise
and
rushed
thither
.
<EOS>
Seeing
Jack
at
liberty
,
he
instantly
seized
him
,
and
a
struggle
commenced
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
Blueskin
came
up
,
and
kept
off
the
officers
with
his
knife
.
<EOS>
He
used
his
utmost
efforts
to
liberate
Jack
from
Langley
,
but
closely
pressed
on
all
sides
,
he
was
not
able
to
render
any
effectual
assistance
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fly
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jack
;
"
escape
if
you
can
;
do
n't
mind
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
Casting
one
look
of
anguish
at
his
leader
,
Blueskin
then
darted
down
the
passage
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
persons
in
the
Lodge
were
Mrs.
Spurling
and
Marvel
.
<EOS>
Hearing
the
noise
of
the
scuffle
,
the
tapstress
,
fancying
it
was
Jack
making
an
effort
to
escape
,
in
spite
of
the
remonstrances
of
the
executioner
,
threw
open
the
wicket
.
<EOS>
Blueskin
therefore
had
nothing
to
stop
him
.
<EOS>
Dashing
through
the
open
door
,
he
crossed
the
Old
Bailey
,
plunged
into
a
narrow
court
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
,
and
was
out
of
sight
in
a
minute
,
baffling
all
pursuit
.
 
<EOS>
On
their
return
,
the
jailers
raised
up
Jonathan
,
who
was
weltering
in
his
blood
,
and
who
appeared
to
be
dying
.
<EOS>
Efforts
were
made
to
staunch
his
wounds
and
surgical
assistance
sent
for
.
 
<EOS>
"
Has
he
escaped
?
"
asked
the
thief
-
taker
,
faintly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Blueskin
,
"
said
Ireton
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
--
Sheppard
?
"
rejoined
Wild
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Ireton
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
right
,
"
replied
Wild
,
with
a
ghastly
smile
.
<EOS>
"
Remove
him
to
the
Middle
Stone
Hold,--watch
over
him
night
and
day
,
do
you
mind
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
Sir
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Irons
--
heavy
irons
--
night
and
day
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Depend
upon
it
,
Sir
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Go
with
him
to
<EOS>
Tyburn,--never
lose
sight
of
him
till
the
noose
is
tied
.
<EOS>
Where
's
Marvel
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Here
,
Sir
,
"
replied
the
executioner
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
hundred
guineas
if
you
hang
Jack
Sheppard
.
<EOS>
I
have
it
about
me
.
<EOS>
Take
it
,
if
I
die
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
fear
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Marvel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
that
I
could
live
to
see
it
,
"
gasped
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
And
with
a
hideous
expression
of
pain
,
he
fainted
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
dead
,
"
exclaimed
Austin
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
content
,
"
said
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
My
mother
is
avenged
.
<EOS>
Take
me
to
the
Stone
Room
.
<EOS>
Blueskin
,
you
are
a
true
friend
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
body
of
Jonathan
was
then
conveyed
to
his
own
habitation
,
while
Jack
was
taken
to
the
Middle
Stone
Room
,
and
ironed
in
the
manner
Wild
had
directed
.

CHAPTER
XXVIII
.
 
<EOS>
What
happened
at
Dollis
Hill
.
  
<EOS>
"
At
length
this
tragedy
is
at
an
end
,
"
said
Mr.
Wood
,
as
,
having
seen
the
earth
thrown
over
the
remains
of
the
unfortunate
Mrs.
Sheppard
,
he
turned
to
quit
the
churchyard
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
hope
that
,
like
her
who
'
loved
much
,
'
her
sins
are
forgiven
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
Without
another
word
,
and
accompanied
by
Thames
,
he
then
took
his
way
to
Dollis
Hill
in
a
state
of
the
deepest
depression
.
<EOS>
Thames
did
not
attempt
to
offer
him
any
consolation
,
for
he
was
almost
as
much
dejected
.
<EOS>
The
weather
harmonized
with
their
feelings
.
<EOS>
It
rained
slightly
,
and
a
thick
mist
gathered
in
the
air
,
and
obscured
the
beautiful
prospect
.
 
<EOS>
On
his
arrival
at
Dollis
Hill
,
Mr.
Wood
was
so
much
exhausted
that
he
was
obliged
to
retire
to
his
own
room
,
where
he
continued
for
some
hours
overpowered
by
grief
.
<EOS>
The
two
lovers
sat
together
,
and
their
sole
discourse
turned
upon
Jack
and
his
ill
-
fated
mother
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
night
advanced
,
Mr.
Wood
again
made
his
appearance
in
a
more
composed
frame
of
mind
,
and
,
at
his
daughter
's
earnest
solicitation
,
was
induced
to
partake
of
some
refreshment
.
<EOS>
An
hour
was
then
passed
in
conversation
as
to
the
possibility
of
rendering
any
assistance
to
Jack
;
in
deploring
his
unhappy
destiny
;
and
in
the
consideration
of
the
course
to
be
pursued
in
reference
to
Jonathan
Wild
.
 
<EOS>
While
they
were
thus
occupied
,
a
maid
-
servant
entered
the
room
,
and
stated
that
a
person
was
without
who
had
a
packet
for
Captain
Darrell
,
which
must
be
delivered
into
his
own
hands
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
remonstrances
of
Wood
and
Winifred
,
Thames
instantly
followed
the
domestic
,
and
found
a
man
,
with
his
face
muffled
up
,
at
the
door
,
as
she
had
described
.
<EOS>
Somewhat
alarmed
at
his
appearance
,
Thames
laid
his
hand
upon
his
sword
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fear
nothing
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
man
,
in
a
voice
which
Thames
instantly
recognised
as
that
of
Blueskin
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
come
to
render
you
a
service
.
<EOS>
There
are
the
packets
which
my
Captain
hazarded
his
life
to
procure
for
you
,
and
which
he
said
would
establish
your
right
to
the
estates
of
the
Trenchard
family
.
<EOS>
There
are
also
the
letters
which
were
scattered
about
Wild
's
room
after
the
murder
of
Sir
Rowland
.
<EOS>
And
there
,
"
he
added
,
placing
in
his
hands
a
heavy
bag
of
money
,
and
a
pocket
-
book
,
"
is
a
sum
little
short
of
fifteen
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
have
you
procured
these
things
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Thames
,
in
the
utmost
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
carried
them
off
on
the
fatal
night
when
we
got
into
Wild
's
house
,
and
you
were
struck
down
,
"
replied
Blueskin
.
<EOS>
"
They
have
ever
since
been
deposited
in
a
place
of
safety
.
<EOS>
You
have
nothing
more
to
fear
from
Wild
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
so
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
saved
the
executioner
a
labour
,
by
cutting
his
throat
,
"
replied
Blueskin
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
may
I
be
cursed
if
I
ever
did
anything
in
my
whole
life
which
gave
me
so
much
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Almighty
God
!
<EOS>
is
this
possible
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
find
it
true
,
"
replied
Blueskin
.
<EOS>
"
All
I
regret
is
,
that
I
failed
in
liberating
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
got
off
,
they
might
have
hanged
me
,
and
welcome
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
can
be
done
for
him
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
not
an
easy
question
to
answer
,
"
rejoined
Blueskin
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
shall
watch
night
and
day
about
Newgate
,
in
the
hope
of
getting
him
out
.
<EOS>
He
would
n't
require
my
aid
,
but
before
I
stopped
Jonathan
's
mouth
,
he
had
ordered
him
to
be
doubly
-
ironed
,
and
constantly
watched
.
<EOS>
And
,
though
the
villain
ca
n't
see
his
orders
executed
,
I
've
no
doubt
some
one
else
will
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
Jack
!
"
exclaimed
Thames
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
sacrifice
all
my
fortune
--
all
my
hopes
--
to
liberate
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
're
in
earnest
,
"
rejoined
Blueskin
,
"
give
me
that
bag
of
gold
.
<EOS>
It
contains
a
thousand
pounds
;
and
,
if
all
other
schemes
fail
,
I
'll
engage
to
free
him
on
the
way
to
Tyburn
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
May
I
trust
you
?
"
<EOS>
hesitated
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
did
I
not
keep
the
money
when
I
had
it
?
"
<EOS>
returned
Blueskin
,
angrily
.
"
Not
a
farthing
of
it
shall
be
expended
except
in
the
Captain
's
service
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Take
it
,
"
replied
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
saved
his
life
,
"
replied
Blueskin
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
mark
me
.
<EOS>
You
owe
what
I
have
done
for
you
,
to
him
,
not
to
me
.
<EOS>
Had
I
not
known
that
you
and
your
affianced
bride
are
dearer
to
him
than
life
<EOS>
I
should
have
used
this
money
to
secure
my
own
safety
.
<EOS>
Take
it
,
and
take
the
estates
,
in
Captain
Sheppard
's
name
.
<EOS>
Promise
me
one
thing
before
I
leave
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
"
asked
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
the
Captain
_
is
_
taken
to
Tyburn
,
be
near
the
place
of
execution
--
at
the
end
of
the
Edgeware
Road
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
case
of
need
you
will
lend
a
helping
hand
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
--
yes
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Swear
it
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Enough
!
"
rejoined
Blueskin
.
<EOS>
And
he
departed
,
just
as
Wood
,
who
had
become
alarmed
by
Thames
's
long
absence
,
made
his
appearance
with
a
blunderbuss
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Hastily
acquainting
him
with
the
treasures
he
had
unexpectedly
obtained
,
Thames
returned
to
the
room
to
apprize
Winifred
of
his
good
fortune
.
<EOS>
The
packets
were
hastily
broken
open
;
and
,
while
Wood
was
absorbed
in
the
perusal
of
the
despatch
addressed
to
him
by
Sir
Rowland
,
Thames
sought
out
,
and
found
the
letter
which
he
had
been
prevented
from
finishing
on
the
fatal
night
at
Jonathan
Wild
's
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
had
read
it
,
he
let
it
fall
from
his
grasp
.
 
<EOS>
Winifred
instantly
picked
it
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
no
longer
Thames
Darrell
,
"
she
said
,
casting
her
eyes
rapidly
over
it
;
"
but
the
Marquis
de
Chatillon
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
father
was
of
the
blood
-
royal
of
France
,
"
exclaimed
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
"
Eh
-
day
!
<EOS>
what
's
this
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Wood
,
looking
up
from
beneath
his
spectacles
.
<EOS>
"
Who
--
who
is
the
Marquis
de
Chatillon
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
adopted
son
,
Thames
Darrell
,
"
answered
Winifred
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
the
Marchioness
is
your
daughter
,
"
added
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
"
O
,
Lord
!
"
ejaculated
Wood
.
<EOS>
"
My
head
fairly
turns
round
.
<EOS>
So
many
distresses
--
so
many
joys
coming
at
the
same
time
are
too
much
for
me
.
<EOS>
Read
that
letter
,
Thames
--
my
lord
marquis
,
I
mean
.
<EOS>
Read
it
,
and
you
'll
find
that
your
unfortunate
uncle
,
Sir
Rowland
,
surrenders
to
you
all
the
estates
in
Lancashire
.
<EOS>
You
've
nothing
to
do
but
to
take
possession
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
a
strange
history
is
mine
!
"
said
Thames
.
<EOS>
"
Kidnapped
,
and
sent
to
France
by
one
uncle
,
it
was
my
lot
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
another,--my
father
's
own
brother
,
the
Marshal
Gaucher
de
Chatillon
;
to
whom
,
and
to
the
Cardinal
Dubois
,
I
owed
all
my
good
fortune
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
ways
of
Providence
are
inscrutable
,
"
observed
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
in
France
,
I
heard
from
the
Marshal
that
his
brother
had
perished
in
London
on
the
night
of
the
Great
Storm
.
<EOS>
It
was
supposed
he
was
drowned
in
crossing
the
river
,
as
his
body
had
never
been
found
.
<EOS>
Little
did
I
imagine
at
the
time
that
it
was
my
own
father
to
whom
he
referred
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
remember
reading
something
about
your
father
in
the
papers
,
"
observed
Wood
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Was
n't
he
in
some
way
connected
with
the
Jacobite
plots
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
was
,
"
replied
Thames
.
<EOS>
"
He
had
been
many
years
in
this
country
before
his
assassination
took
place
.
<EOS>
In
this
letter
,
which
is
addressed
to
my
ill
-
fated
mother
,
he
speaks
of
his
friendship
for
Sir
Rowland
,
whom
it
seems
he
had
known
abroad
;
but
entreats
her
to
keep
the
marriage
secret
for
a
time
,
for
reasons
which
are
not
fully
developed
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
so
Sir
Rowland
murdered
his
friend
,
"
remarked
Wood
.
<EOS>
"
Crime
upon
crime
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Unconsciously
,
perhaps
,
"
replied
Thames
.
<EOS>
"
But
be
it
as
it
may
,
he
is
now
beyond
the
reach
of
earthly
punishment
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
Wild
still
lives
,
"
cried
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
;
also
,
has
paid
the
penalty
of
his
offences
,
"
returned
Thames
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
has
fallen
by
the
hand
of
Blueskin
,
who
brought
me
these
packets
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Thank
God
for
that
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Wood
,
heartily
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
almost
forgive
the
wretch
the
injury
he
did
me
in
depriving
me
of
my
poor
dear
wife
--
No
,
not
quite
_
that
_
,
"
he
added
,
a
little
confused
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
"
said
Thames
,
(
for
we
must
still
preserve
the
name
,
)
<EOS>
"
you
will
no
longer
defer
my
happiness
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hold
!
"
<EOS>
interposed
Winifred
,
gravely
.
<EOS>
"
I
release
you
from
your
promise
.
<EOS>
A

daughter

fit
match
for
a
peer
of
France
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
my
dignity
must
be
purchased
by
the
loss
of
you
,
I
renounce
it
,
"
cried
Thames
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
make
it
valueless
in
my
eyes
,
"
he
added
,
catching
her
in
his
arms
,
and
pressing
her
to
his
breast
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
it
as
you
please
,
"
replied
Winifred
.
<EOS>
"
My
lips
would
belie
my
heart
were
I
to
refuse
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
father
,
your
blessing
--
your
consent
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
both
,
"
replied
Wood
,
fervently
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
too
much
honoured
--
too
happy
in
the
union
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
that
I
should
live
to
be
father
-
in
-
law
to
a
peer
of
France
!
<EOS>
What
would
my
poor
wife
say
to
it
,
if
she
could
come
to
life
again
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
Thames!--my
lord
marquis
,
I
mean
--
you
have
made
me
the
happiest
--
the
proudest
of
mankind
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Not
many
days
after
this
event
,
on
a
bright
October
morning
,
the
bells
rang
a
merry
peal
from
the
old
gray
tower
of
Willesden
church
.
<EOS>
All
the
village
was
assembled
in
the
churchyard
.
<EOS>
Young
and
old
were
dressed
in
their
gayest
apparel
;
and
it
was
evident
from
the
smiles
that
lighted
up
every
countenance
,
from
the
roguish
looks
of
the
younger
swains
,
and
the
demure
expression
of
several
pretty
rustic
maidens
,
that
a
ceremony
,
which
never
fails
to
interest
all
classes,--a
wedding,--was
about
to
take
place
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
gate
opening
upon
the
road
leading
to
Dollis
Hill
were
stationed
William
Morgan
and
John
Dump
.
<EOS>
Presently
,
two
carriages
dashed
down
the
hill
,
and
drew
up
before
it
.
<EOS>
From
the
first
of
these
alighted
Thames
,
or
,
as
he
must
now
be
styled
,
the
Marquis
de
Chatillon
.
<EOS>
From
the
second
descended
Mr.
Wood
--
and
after
him
came
his
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
The
sun
never
shone
upon
a
lovelier
couple
than
now
approached
the
altar
.
<EOS>
The
church
was
crowded
to
excess
by
the
numbers
eager
to
witness
the
ceremony
;
and
as
soon
as
it
was
over
the
wedded
pair
were
followed
to
the
carriage
,
and
the
loudest
benedictions
uttered
for
their
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
In
spite
of
the
tumultuous
joy
which
agitated
him
,
the
bridegroom
could
not
prevent
the
intrusion
of
some
saddening
thoughts
,
as
he
reflected
upon
the
melancholy
scene
which
he
had
so
recently
witnessed
in
the
same
place
.
 
<EOS>
The
youthful
couple
had
been
seated
in
the
carriage
a
few
minutes
when
they
were
joined
by
Mr.
Wood
,
who
had
merely
absented
himself
to
see
that
a
public
breakfast
,
which
he
had
ordered
at
the
Six
Bells
for
all
who
chose
to
partake
of
it
,
was
in
readiness
.
<EOS>
He
likewise
gave
directions
that
in
the
after
part
of
the
day
a
whole
bullock
should
be
roasted
on
the
green
and
distributed
,
together
with
a
barrel
of
the
strongest
ale
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
evening
,
a
band
of
village
musicians
,
accompanied
by
most
of
the
young
inhabitants
of
Willesden
,
strolled
out
to
Dollis
Hill
,
where
they
formed
a
rustic
concert
under
the
great
elm
before
the
door
.
<EOS>
Here
they
were
regaled
with
another
plentiful
meal
by
the
hospitable
carpenter
,
who
personally
superintended
the
repast
.
 
<EOS>
These
festivities
,
however
,
were
not
witnessed
by
the
newly
-
married
pair
,
who
had
departed
immediately
after
the
ceremony
for
Manchester
.

CHAPTER
XXIX
.
 
<EOS>
How
Jack
Sheppard
was
taken
to
Westminster
Hall
.
  
<EOS>
Loaded
with
the
heaviest
fetters
,
and
constantly
watched
by
two
of
the
jailers
'
assistants
,
who
neither
quitted
him
for
a
single
moment
,
nor
suffered
any
visitor
to
approach
him
,
Jack
Sheppard
found
all
attempts
to
escape
impracticable
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
confined
in
the
Middle
Stone
Ward
,
a
spacious
apartment
,
with
good
light
and
air
,
situated
over
the
gateway
on
the
western
side
,
and
allotted
to
him
,
not
for
his
own
convenience
,
but
for
that
of
the
keepers
,
who
,
if
he
had
been
placed
in
a
gloomier
or
more
incommodious
dungeon
,
would
have
necessarily
had
to
share
it
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
Through
this
,
his
last
trial
,
Jack
's
spirits
never
deserted
him
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
resigned
but
cheerful
,
and
held
frequent
and
serious
discourses
with
the
ordinary
,
who
felt
satisfied
of
his
sincere
penitence
.
<EOS>
The
only
circumstance
which
served
to
awaken
a
darker
feeling
in
his
breast
was
,
that
his
implacable
foe
Jonathan
Wild
had
survived
the
wound
inflicted
by
Blueskin
,
and
was
slowly
recovering
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
could
be
moved
with
safety
,
Jonathan
had
himself
transported
to
Newgate
,
where
he
was
carried
into
the
Middle
Ward
,
that
he
might
feast
his
eyes
upon
his
victim
.
<EOS>
Having
seen
every
precaution
taken
to
ensure
his
safe
custody
,
he
departed
,
muttering
to
himself
,
"
I
shall
yet
live
to
see
him
hanged
--
I
shall
live
to
see
him
hanged
.
"
 
<EOS>
Animated
by
his
insatiate
desire
of
vengeance
,
he
seemed
to
gain
strength
<EOS>
daily,--so
<EOS>
much
so
,
that
within
a
fortnight
after
receiving
his
wound
he
was
able
to
stir
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
On
Thursday
,
the
12th
of
November
,
after
having
endured
nearly
a
month
's
imprisonment
,
Jack
Sheppard
was
conveyed
from
Newgate
to
Westminster
Hall
.
<EOS>
He
was
placed
in
a
coach
,
handcuffed
,
and
heavily
fettered
,
and
guarded
by
a
vast
posse
of
officers
to
Temple
Bar
,
where
a
fresh
relay
of
constables
escorted
him
to
Westminster
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
Jack
's
reputation
had
risen
to
such
a
height
with
the
populace,--his
exploits
having
become
the
universal
theme
of
discourse
,
that
the
streets
were
almost
impassable
for
the
crowds
collected
to
obtain
a
view
of
him
.
<EOS>
The
vast
area
in
front
of
Westminster
Hall
was
thronged
with
people
,
and
it
was
only
by
a
vigorous
application
of
their
staves
that
the
constables
could
force
a
passage
for
the
vehicle
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
however
,
the
prisoner
was
got
out
,
when
such
was
the
rush
of
the
multitude
that
several
persons
were
trampled
down
,
and
received
severe
injuries
.
 
<EOS>
Arrived
in
the
Hall
,
the
prisoner
's
handcuffs
were
removed
,
and
he
was
taken
before
the
Court
of
King
's
Bench
.
<EOS>
The
record
of
his
conviction
at
the
Old
Bailey
sessions
was
then
read
;
and
as
no
objection
was
offered
to
it
,
the
Attorney
-
General
moved
that
his
execution
might
take
place
on
Monday
next
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
Jack
earnestly
and
eloquently
addressed
himself
to
the
bench
,
and
besought
that
a
petition
which
he
had
prepared
to
be
laid
before
the
King
might
be
read
.
<EOS>
This
request
,
however
,
was
refused
;
and
he
was
told
that
the
only
way
in
which
he
could
entitle
himself
to
his
Majesty
's
clemency
would
be
by
discovering
who
had
abetted
him
in
his
last
escape
;
the
strongest
suspicions
being
entertained
that
he
had
not
affected
it
alone
.
 
<EOS>
Sheppard
replied
by
a
solemn
assertion
,
"
that
he
had
received
no
assistance
except
from
Heaven
.
<EOS>
"--An
answer
for
which
he
was
immediately
reprimanded
by
the
court
.
<EOS>
It
having
been
stated
that
it
was
wholly
impossible
he
could
have
removed
his
irons
in
the
way
he
represented
,
he
offered
,
if
his
handcuffs
were
replaced
,
to
take
them
off
in
the
presence
of
the
court
.
<EOS>
The
proposal
,
however
,
was
not
acceded
to
;
and
the
Chief
Justice
Powis
,
after
enumerating
his
various
offences
and
commenting
upon
their
heinousness
,
awarded
sentence
of
death
against
him
for
the
following
Monday
.
 
<EOS>
As
Jack
was
removed
,
he
noticed
Jonathan
Wild
at
a
little
distance
from
him
,
eyeing
him
with
a
look
of
the
most
savage
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
The
thief
-
taker
's
throat
was
bound
up
with
thick
folds
of
linen
,
and
his
face
had
a
ghastly
and
cadaverous
look
,
which
communicated
an
undefinable
and
horrible
expression
to
his
glances
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
mob
outside
had
prodigiously
increased
,
and
had
begun
to
exhibit
some
disposition
to
riot
.
<EOS>
The
coach
in
which
the
prisoner
had
been
conveyed
was
already
broken
to
pieces
,
and
the
driver
was
glad
to
escape
with
life
.
<EOS>
Terrific
shouts
were
raised
by
the
rabble
,
who
threatened
to
tear
Wild
in
pieces
if
he
showed
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Amid
this
tumult
,
several
men
armed
with
tremendous
bludgeons
,
with
their
faces
besmeared
with
grease
and
soot
,
and
otherwise
disguised
,
were
observed
to
be
urging
the
populace
to
attempt
a
rescue
.
<EOS>
They
were
headed
by
an
athletic
-
looking
,
swarthy
-
featured
man
,
who
was
armed
with
a
cutlass
,
which
he
waved
over
his
head
to
cheer
on
his
companions
.
 
<EOS>
These
desperadoes
had
been
the
most
active
in
demolishing
the
coach
,
and
now
,
being
supported
by
the
rabble
,
they
audaciously
approached
the
very
portals
of
the
ancient
Hall
.
<EOS>
The
shouts
,
yells
,
and
groans
which
they
uttered
,
and
which
were
echoed
by
the
concourse
in
the
rear
,
were
perfectly
frightful
.
 
<EOS>
Jonathan
,
who
with
the
other
constables
had
reconnoitred
this
band
,
and
recognised
in
its
ring
-
leader
,
Blueskin
,
commanded
the
constables
to
follow
him
,
and
made
a
sally
for
the
purpose
of
seizing
him
.
<EOS>
Enfeebled
by
his
wound
,
Wild
had
lost
much
of
his
strength
,
though
nothing
of
his
ferocity
and
energy,--and
fiercely
assailing
Blueskin
,
he
made
a
desperate
but
unsuccessful
attempt
to
apprehend
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
,
however
,
instantly
beaten
back
;
and
the
fury
of
the
mob
was
so
great
that
it
was
with
difficulty
he
could
effect
a
retreat
.
<EOS>
The
whole
force
of
the
constables
,
jailers
and
others
was
required
to
keep
the
crowd
out
of
the
Hall
.
<EOS>
The
doors
were
closed
and
barricaded
,
and
the
mob
threatened
to
burst
them
open
if
Jack
was
not
delivered
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
Things
now
began
to
wear
so
serious
a
aspect
that
a
messenger
was
secretly
despatched
to
the
Savoy
for
troops
,
and
in
half
an
hour
a
regiment
of
the
guards
arrived
,
who
by
dint
of
great
exertion
succeeded
in
partially
dispersing
the
tumultuous
assemblage
.
<EOS>
Another
coach
was
then
procured
,
in
which
the
prisoner
was
placed
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
's
appearance
was
hailed
with
the
loudest
cheers
,
but
when
Jonathan
followed
and
took
a
place
beside
him
in
the
vehicle
,
determined
,
he
said
,
never
to
lose
sight
of
him
,
the
abhorrence
of
the
multitude
was
expressed
by
execrations
,
hoots
,
and
yells
of
the
most
terrific
kind
.
<EOS>
So
dreadful
were
these
shouts
as
to
produce
an
effect
upon
the
hardened
feelings
of
Jonathan
,
who
shrank
out
of
sight
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
well
for
him
that
he
had
taken
his
place
by
Sheppard
,
as
regard
for
the
latter
alone
prevented
the
deadliest
missiles
being
hurled
at
him
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
the
mob
went
on
alternately
hooting
and
huzzaing
as
the
names
of
Wild
and
Sheppard
were
pronounced
,
while
some
individuals
,
bolder
than
the
rest
,
thrust
their
faces
into
the
coach
-
window
,
and
assured
Jack
that
he
should
never
be
taken
to
Tyburn
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
'll
see
that
,
you
yelping
hounds
!
"
rejoined
Jonathan
,
glaring
fiercely
at
them
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
way
,
Jack
was
brought
back
to
Newgate
,
and
again
chained
down
in
the
Middle
Ward
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
late
before
Jonathan
ventured
to
his
own
house
,
where
he
remained
up
all
night
,
and
kept
his
janizaries
and
other
assistants
well
armed
.

CHAPTER
XXX
.
 
<EOS>
How
Jonathan
Wild
's
House
was
burnt
down
.
  
<EOS>
The
day
appointed
for
the
execution
was
now
close
at
hand
,
and
the
prisoner
,
who
seemed
to
have
abandoned
all
hopes
of
escape
,
turned
his
thoughts
entirely
from
worldly
considerations
.
 
<EOS>
On
Sunday
,
he
was
conveyed
to
the
chapel
,
through
which
he
had
passed
on
the
occasion
of
his
great
escape
,
and
once
more
took
his
seat
in
the
Condemned
Pew
.
<EOS>
The
Rev.
Mr.
Purney
,
the
ordinary
,
who
had
latterly
conceived
a
great
regard
for
Jack
,
addressed
him
in
a
discourse
,
which
,
while
it
tended
to
keep
alive
his
feelings
of
penitence
,
was
calculated
to
afford
him
much
consolation
.
<EOS>
The
chapel
was
crowded
to
excess
.
<EOS>
But
here,--even
here
,
the
demon
was
suffered
to
intrude
,
and
Jack
's
thoughts
were
distracted
by
Jonathan
Wild
,
who
stood
at
a
little
distance
from
him
,
and
kept
his
bloodthirsty
eyes
fixed
on
him
during
the
whole
of
the
service
.
 
<EOS>
On
that
night
,
an
extraordinary
event
occurred
,
which
convinced
the
authorities
that
every
precaution
must
be
taken
in
conducting
Jack
to
Tyburn,--a
fact
of
which
they
had
been
previously
made
aware
,
though
scarcely
to
the
same
extent
,
by
the
riotous
proceedings
near
Westminster
Hall
.
<EOS>
About
nine
o'clock
,
an
immense
mob
collected
before
the
Lodge
at
Newgate
.
<EOS>
It
was
quite
dark
;
but
as
some
of
the
assemblage
carried
links
,
it
was
soon
ascertained
to
be
headed
by
the
same
party
who
had
mainly
incited
the
former
disturbance
.
<EOS>
Amongst
the
ring
-
leaders
was
Blueskin
,
whose
swarthy
features
and
athletic
figure
were
easily
distinguished
.
<EOS>
Another
was
Baptist
Kettleby
,
and
a
third
,
in
a
Dutch
dress
,
was
recognised
by
his
grizzled
beard
as
the
skipper
,
Van
Galgebrok
.
 
<EOS>
Before
an
hour
had
elapsed
,
the
concourse
was
fearfully
increased
.
<EOS>
The
area
in
front
of
the
jail
was
completely
filled
.
<EOS>
Attempts
were
made
upon
the
door
of
the
Lodge
;
but
it
was
too
strong
to
be
forced
.
<EOS>
A
cry
was
then
raised
by
the
leaders
to
attack
Wild
's
house
,
and
the
fury
of
the
mob
was
instantly
directed
to
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
Wrenched
from
their
holds
,
the
iron
palisades
in
front
of
the
thief
-
taker
's
dwelling
were
used
as
weapons
to
burst
open
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
While
this
was
passing
,
Jonathan
opened
one
of
the
upper
windows
,
and
fired
several
shots
upon
the
assailants
.
<EOS>
But
though
he
made
Blueskin
and
Kettleby
his
chief
marks
,
he
missed
both
.
<EOS>
The
sight
of
the
thief
-
taker
increased
the
fury
of
the
mob
to
a
fearful
degree
.
<EOS>
Terrific
yells
rent
the
air
.
<EOS>
The
heavy
weapon
thundered
against
the
door
;
and
it
speedily
yielded
to
their
efforts
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
on
,
my
lads
!
"
<EOS>
vociferated
Blueskin
,
"
we
'll
unkennel
the
old
fox
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
several
shots
were
fired
from
the
upper
part
of
the
house
,
and
two
men
fell
mortally
wounded
.
<EOS>
But
this
only
incensed
the
assailing
party
the
more
.
<EOS>
With
a
drawn
cutlass
in
one
hand
and
a
cocked
pistol
in
the
other
,
Blueskin
rushed
up
stairs
.
<EOS>
The
landing
was
defended
by
Quilt
Arnold
and
the
Jew
.
<EOS>
The
former
was
shot
by
Blueskin
through
the
head
,
and
his
body
fell
over
the
bannisters
.
<EOS>
The
Jew
,
who
was
paralysed
by
his
companion
's
fate
,
offered
no
resistance
,
and
was
instantly
seized
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
is
your
accursed
master
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Blueskin
,
holding
the
sword
to
his
throat
.
 
<EOS>
The
Jew
did
not
speak
,
but
pointed
to
the
audience
-
chamber
.
<EOS>
Committing
him
to
the
custody
of
the
others
,
Blueskin
,
followed
by
a
numerous
band
,
darted
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
The
door
was
locked
;
but
,
with
the
bars
of
iron
,
it
was
speedily
burst
open
.
<EOS>
Several
of
the
assailants
carried
links
,
so
that
the
room
was
a
blaze
of
light
.
<EOS>
Jonathan
,
however
,
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
.
 
<EOS>
Rushing
towards
the
entrance
of
the
well
-
hole
,
Blueskin
touched
the
secret
spring
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
there
.
<EOS>
Opening
the
trap
-
door
,
he
then
descended
to
the
vaults
--
searched
each
cell
,
and
every
nook
and
corner
separately
.
<EOS>
Wild
had
escaped
.
 
<EOS>
Robbed
of
their
prey
,
the
fury
of
the
mob
became
ungovernable
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
at
the
end
of
a
passage
,
next
to
the
cell
where
Mrs.
Sheppard
had
been
confined
,
Blueskin
discovered
a
trap
-
door
which
he
had
not
previously
noticed
.
<EOS>
It
was
instantly
burst
open
,
when
the
horrible
stench
that
issued
from
it
convinced
them
that
it
must
be
a
receptacle
for
the
murdered
victims
of
the
thief
-
taker
.
 
<EOS>
Holding
a
link
into
the
place
,
which
had
the
appearance
of
a
deep
pit
,
Blueskin
noticed
a
body
richly
dressed
.
<EOS>
He
dragged
it
out
,
and
perceiving
,
in
spite
of
the
decayed
frame
,
that
it
was
the
body
of
Sir
Rowland
Trenchard
,
commanded
his
attendants
to
convey
it
up
stairs
--
an
order
which
was
promptly
obeyed
.
 
<EOS>
Returning
to
the
audience
-
chamber
,
Blueskin
had
the
Jew
brought
before
him
.
<EOS>
The
body
of
Sir
Rowland
was
then
laid
on
the
large
table
.
<EOS>
Opposite
to
it
was
placed
the
Jew
.
<EOS>
Seeing
from
the
threatening
looks
of
his
captors
,
that
they
were
about
to
wreak
their
vengeance
upon
him
,
the
miserable
wretch
besought
mercy
in
abject
terms
,
and
charged
his
master
with
the
most
atrocious
crimes
.
<EOS>
His
relation
of
the
murder
of
Sir
Rowland
petrified
even
his
fierce
auditors
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
the
cases
in
Jonathan
's
museum
was
now
burst
open
,
and
a
rope
taken
from
it
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
his
shrieks
,
the
miserable
Jew
was
then
dragged
into
the
well
-
hole
,
and
the
rope
being
tied
round
his
neck
,
he
was
launched
from
the
bridge
.
 
<EOS>
The
vengeance
of
the
assailants
did
not
stop
here
.
<EOS>
They
broke
open
the
entrance
into
Jonathan
's
store
-
room
--
plundered
it
of
everything
valuable
--
ransacked
every
closet
,
drawer
,
and
secret
hiding
-
place
,
and
stripped
them
of
their
contents
.
<EOS>
Large
hoards
of
money
were
discovered
,
gold
and
silver
plate
,
cases
of
watches
,
and
various
precious
articles
.
<EOS>
Nothing
,
in
short
,
portable
or
valuable
was
left
.
<EOS>
Old
implements
of
housebreaking
were
discovered
;
and
the
thief
-
taker
's
most
hidden
depositories
were
laid
bare
.
 
<EOS>
The
work
of
plunder
over
,
that
of
destruction
commenced
.
<EOS>
Straw
and
other
combustibles
being
collected
,
were
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
audience
-
chamber
.
<EOS>
On
these
were
thrown
all
the
horrible
contents
of
Jonathan
's
museum
,
together
with
the
body
of
Sir
Rowland
Trenchard
.
<EOS>
The
whole
was
then
fired
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
room
was
a
blaze
.
<EOS>
Not
content
with
this
,
the
assailants
set
fire
to
the
house
in
half
-
a
-
dozen
other
places
;
and
the
progress
of
the
flames
was
rapid
and
destructive
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
object
of
all
this
fearful
disturbance
had
made
his
escape
to
Newgate
,
from
the
roof
of
which
he
witnessed
the
destruction
of
his
premises
.
<EOS>
He
saw
the
flames
burst
from
the
windows
,
and
perhaps
in
that
maddening
spectacle
suffered
torture
equivalent
to
some
of
the
crimes
he
had
committed
.
 
<EOS>
While
he
was
thus
standing
,
the
flames
of
his
house
,
which
made
the
whole
street
as
light
as
day
,
and
ruddily
illumined
the
faces
of
the
mob
below
,
betrayed
him
to
them
,
and
he
was
speedily
driven
from
his
position
by
a
shower
of
stones
and
other
missiles
.
 
<EOS>
The
mob
now
directed
their
attention
to
Newgate
;
and
,
from
their
threats
,
appeared
determined
to
fire
it
.
<EOS>
Ladders
,
paviour
's
rams
,
sledge
-
hammers
,
and
other
destructive
implements
were
procured
,
and
,
in
all
probability
,
their
purpose
would
have
been
effected
,
but
for
the
opportune
arrival
of
a
detachment
of
the
guards
,
who
dispersed
them
,
not
without
some
loss
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
Several
prisoners
were
taken
,
but
the
ring
-
leaders
escaped
.
<EOS>
Engines
were
brought
to
play
upon
Wild
's
premises
,
and
upon
the
adjoining
houses
.
<EOS>
The
latter
were
saved
;
but
of
the
former
nothing
but
the
blackened
stone
walls
were
found
standing
on
the
morrow
.

CHAPTER
XXXI
.
 
<EOS>
The
Procession
to
Tyburn
.
  
<EOS>
The
noise
of
this
disturbance
did
not
fail
to
reach
the
interior
of
the
prison
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
the
reflection
of
the
flames
lighted
up
the
ward
in
which
Jack
Sheppard
was
confined
.
 
<EOS>
The
night
his
execution
was
therefore
passed
in
a
most
anxious
state
of
mind
;
nor
was
his
uneasiness
allayed
by
the
appearance
of
Jonathan
Wild
,
who
,
after
he
had
been
driven
from
the
roof
of
the
jail
,
repaired
to
the
Middle
Stone
Ward
in
a
fit
of
ungovernable
passion
,
to
vent
his
rage
upon
the
prisoner
,
whom
he
looked
upon
as
the
cause
of
the
present
calamity
.
<EOS>
Such
was
his
fury
,
that
if
he
had
not
been
restrained
by
the
presence
of
the
two
turnkeys
,
he
might
perhaps
have
anticipated
the
course
of
justice
,
by
laying
violent
hands
upon
his
victim
.
 
<EOS>
After
venting
his
wrath
in
the
wildest
manner
,
and
uttering
the
most
dreadful
execrations
,
Jonathan
retired
to
another
part
of
the
prison
,
where
he
passed
the
night
in
consultation
with
the
governor
,
as
to
the
best
means
of
conveying
the
prisoner
securely
to
Tyburn
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Pitt
endeavoured
to
dissuade
him
from
attending
in
person
,
representing
the
great
risk
he
would
incur
from
the
mob
,
which
was
certain
to
be
assembled
.
<EOS>
But
Jonathan
was
not
to
be
deterred
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
sworn
to
see
him
hanged
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
nothing
shall
keep
me
away
--
nothing
,
by----
.
"
 
<EOS>
By
Wild
's
advice
,
the
usual
constabulary
force
was
greatly
augmented
.
<EOS>
Messengers
were
despatched
to
all
the
constables
and
head
-
boroughs
to
be
in
attendance,--to
the
sheriffs
to
have
an
extraordinary
number
of
their
officers
in
attendance,--and
to
the
Savoy
,
to
obtain
the
escort
of
a
troop
of
grenadier
-
guards
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
more
preparations
were
made
than
if
a
state
criminal
was
about
to
be
executed
.
 
<EOS>
The
morning
of
Monday
the
16th
of
November
1724
at
length
dawned
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
dull
,
foggy
day
,
and
the
atmosphere
was
so
thick
and
heavy
,
that
,
at
eight
o'clock
,
the
curious
who
arrived
near
the
prison
could
scarcely
discern
the
tower
of
St.
Sepulchre
's
church
.
 
<EOS>
By
and
by
the
tramp
of
horses
'
feet
was
heard
slowly
ascending
Snow
Hill
,
and
presently
a
troop
of
grenadier
guards
rode
into
the
area
facing
Newgate
.
<EOS>
These
were
presently
joined
by
a
regiment
of
foot
.
<EOS>
A
large
body
of
the
constables
of
Westminster
next
made
their
appearance
,
the
chief
of
whom
entered
the
Lodge
,
where
they
were
speedily
joined
by
the
civic
authorities
.
<EOS>
At
nine
o'clock
,
the
sheriffs
arrived
,
followed
by
their
officers
and
javelin
-
men
.
 
<EOS>
Meantime
,
the
Stone
Hall
was
crowded
by
all
the
inmates
of
the
jail
,
debtors
,
felons
,
turnkeys
,
and
officers
who
could
obtain
permission
to
witness
the
ceremony
of
the
prisoner
's
irons
being
struck
off
.
<EOS>
Caliban
,
who
,
through
the
interest
of
Mr.
Ireton
,
was
appointed
to
the
office
,
stood
with
a
hammer
in
one
hand
,
and
a
punch
in
the
other
,
near
the
great
stone
block
,
ready
to
fulfil
his
duty
.
<EOS>
Close
behind
him
stood
the
tall
gaunt
figure
of
Marvel
,
with
his
large
bony
hands
,
his
scraggy
neck
,
and
ill
-
favoured
countenance
.
<EOS>
Next
to
the
executioner
stood
his
wife
--
the
former
Mrs.
Spurling
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Marvel
held
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
,
and
appeared
in
great
distress
.
<EOS>
But
her
husband
,
whose
deportment
to
her
was
considerably
changed
since
the
fatal
knot
had
been
tied
,
paid
no
attention
whatever
to
her
grief
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
the
bell
of
Newgate
began
to
toll
,
and
was
answered
by
another
bell
from
St.
Sepulchre
's
.
<EOS>
The
great
door
of
the
Stone
Hall
was
thrown
open
,
and
the
sheriffs
,
preceded
by
the
javelin
-
men
,
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
They
were
followed
by
Jonathan
,
who
carried
a
stout
stick
under
his
arm
,
and
planted
himself
near
the
stone
.
<EOS>
Not
a
word
was
uttered
by
the
assemblage
;
but
a
hush
of
expectation
reigned
throughout
.
 
<EOS>
Another
door
was
next
opened
,
and
,
preceded
by
the
ordinary
,
with
the
sacred
volume
in
his
hand
,
the
prisoner
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
Though
encumbered
by
his
irons
,
his
step
was
firm
,
and
his
demeanour
dignified
.
<EOS>
His
countenance
was
pale
as
death
,
but
not
a
muscle
quivered
;
nor
did
he
betray
the
slightest
appearance
of
fear
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
it
was
impossible
to
look
at
him
without
perceiving
that
his
resolution
was
unshaken
.
 
<EOS>
Advancing
with
a
slow
firm
step
to
the
stone
-
block
he
placed
his
left
foot
upon
it
,
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
,
and
fixed
a
look
so
stern
upon
Jonathan
,
that
the
thief
-
taker
quailed
before
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
black
,
meantime
,
began
to
ply
his
hammer
,
and
speedily
unriveted
the
chains
.
<EOS>
The
first
stroke
appeared
to
arouse
all
the
vindictive
passions
of
Jonathan
.
<EOS>
Fixing
a
ferocious
and
exulting
look
upon
Jack
Sheppard
,
he
exclaimed
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
length
,
my
vengeance
is
complete
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Wretch
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jack
,
raising
his
hand
in
a
menacing
manner
,
"
your
triumph
will
be
short
-
lived
.
<EOS>
Before
a
year
has
expired
,
you
will
share
the
same
fate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
do
,
I
care
not
,
"
rejoined
Wild
;
"
I
shall
have
lived
to
see
you
hanged
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
O
Jack
,
dear
,
dear
Jack
!
"
cried
Mrs.
Marvel
,
who
was
now
quite
dissolved
in
tears
,
"
I
shall
never
survive
this
scene
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hold
your
tongue
,
hussy
!
"
cried
her
husband
gruffly
.
<EOS>
"
Women
ought
never
to
show
themselves
on
these
occasions
,
unless
they
can
behave
themselves
properly
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Farewell
,
Jack
,
"
cried
twenty
voices
.
 
<EOS>
Sheppard
looked
round
,
and
exchanged
kindly
glances
with
several
of
those
who
addressed
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
limbs
feel
so
light
,
now
that
my
irons
are
removed
,
"
he
observed
with
a
smile
,
"
that
I
am
half
inclined
to
dance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
'll
dance
upon
nothing
,
presently
,
"
rejoined
Jonathan
,
brutally
.
 
<EOS>
"
Farewell
for
ever
,
"
said
Jack
,
extending
his
hand
to
Mrs.
Marvel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Farewell
!
"
<EOS>
blubbered
the
executioner
's
wife
,
pressing
his
hand
to
her
lips
.
<EOS>
"
Here
are
a
pair
of
gloves
and
a
nosegay
for
you
.
<EOS>
Oh
dear!--oh
dear
!
<EOS>
Be
careful
of
him
,
"
she
added
to
her
husband
,
"
and
get
it
over
quickly
,
or
never
expect
to
see
me
again
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Peace
,
fool
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Marvel
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
think
I
do
n't
know
my
own
business
?
"
 
<EOS>
Austin
and
Langley
then
advanced
to
the
prisoner
,
and
,
twinning
their
arms
round
his
,
led
him
down
to
the
Lodge
,
whither
he
was
followed
by
the
sheriffs
,
the
ordinary
,
Wild
,
and
the
other
officials
.
 
<EOS>
Meantime
,
every
preparation
had
been
made
outside
for
his
departure
.
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
two
long
lines
of
foot
-
guards
stood
the
cart
with
a
powerful
black
horse
harnessed
to
it
.
<EOS>
At
the
head
of
the
cart
was
placed
the
coffin
.
<EOS>
On
the
right
were
several
mounted
grenadiers
:
on
the
left
,
some
half
dozen
javelin
-
men
.
<EOS>
Soldiers
were
stationed
at
different
points
of
the
street
to
keep
off
the
mob
,
and
others
were
riding
backwards
and
forwards
to
maintain
an
open
space
for
the
passage
of
the
procession
.
 
<EOS>
The
assemblage
which
was
gathered
together
was
almost
countless
.
<EOS>
Every
house
-
top
,
every
window
,
every
wall
,
every
projection
,
had
its
occupants
.
<EOS>
The
wall
of
St.
Sepulchre
's
church
was
covered
--
so
was
the
tower
.
<EOS>
The
concourse
extended
along
Giltspur
Street
as
far
as
Smithfield
.
<EOS>
No
one
was
allowed
to
pass
along
Newgate
Street
,
which
was
barricaded
and
protected
by
a
strong
constabulary
force
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
person
who
issued
from
the
Lodge
was
Mr.
Marvel
,
who
proceeded
to
the
cart
,
and
took
his
seat
upon
the
coffin
.
<EOS>
The
hangman
is
always
an
object
of
peculiar
detestation
to
the
mob
,
a
tremendous
hooting
hailed
his
appearance
,
and
both
staves
and
swords
were
required
to
preserve
order
.
 
<EOS>
A
deep
silence
,
however
,
now
prevailed
,
broken
only
by
the
tolling
of
the
bells
of
Newgate
and
St.
Sepulchre
's
.
<EOS>
The
mighty
concourse
became
for
a
moment
still
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
such
a
shout
as
has
seldom
smitten
human
ears
rent
the
air
.
"
<EOS>
He
comes
!
"
<EOS>
cried
a
thousand
voices
,
and
the
shout
ascended
to
Smithfield
,
descended
to
Snow
Hill
,
and
told
those
who
were
assembled
on
Holborn
Hill
that
Sheppard
had
left
the
prison
.
 
<EOS>
Between
the
two
officers
,
with
their
arms
linked
in
his
,
Jack
Sheppard
was
conducted
to
the
cart
.
<EOS>
He
looked
around
,
and
as
he
heard
that
deafening
shout,--as
<EOS>
he
felt
the
influence
of
those
thousand
eyes
fixed
upon
him,--as
he
listened
to
the
cheers
,
all
his
misgivings
--
if
he
had
any
--
vanished
,
and
he
felt
more
as
if
he
were
marching
to
a
triumph
,
than
proceeding
to
a
shameful
death
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
had
no
sooner
taken
his
place
in
the
cart
,
than
he
was
followed
by
the
ordinary
,
who
seated
himself
beside
him
,
and
,
opening
the
book
of
prayer
,
began
to
read
aloud
.
<EOS>
Excited
by
the
scene
,
Jack
,
however
,
could
pay
little
attention
to
the
good
man
's
discourse
,
and
was
lost
in
a
whirl
of
tumultuous
emotions
.
 
<EOS>
The
calvacade
was
now
put
slowly
in
motion
.
<EOS>
The
horse
-
soldiers
wheeled
round
and
cleared
a
path
:
the
foot
closed
in
upon
the
cart
.
<EOS>
Then
came
the
javelin
-
men
,
walking
four
abreast
,
and
lastly
,
a
long
line
of
constables
,
marching
in
the
same
order
.
 
<EOS>
The
procession
had
just
got
into
line
of
march
,
when
a
dreadful
groan
,
mixed
with
yells
,
hootings
,
and
execrations
,
was
heard
.
<EOS>
This
was
occasioned
by
Jonathan
Wild
,
who
was
seen
to
mount
his
horse
and
join
the
train
.
<EOS>
Jonathan
,
however
,
paid
no
sort
of
attention
to
this
demonstration
of
hatred
.
<EOS>
He
had
buckled
on
his
hanger
,
and
had
two
brace
of
pistols
in
his
belt
,
as
well
as
others
in
this
holsters
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
the
procession
had
reached
the
west
end
of
the
wall
of
St.
Sepulchre
's
church
,
where
,
in
compliance
with
an
old
custom
,
it
halted
.
<EOS>
By
the
will
of
Mr.
Robert
Dow
,
merchant
tailor
,
it
was
appointed
that
the
sexton
of
St.
Sepulchre
's
should
pronounce
a
solemn
exhortation
upon
every
criminal
on
his
way
to
Tyburn
,
for
which
office
<EOS>
he
was
to
receive
a
small
stipend
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
cavalcade
stopped
,
the
sexton
advanced
,
and
,
ringing
a
handbell
,
pronounced
the
following
admonition
.
 
<EOS>
"
_
All
good
people
pray
heartily
unto
God
for
this
poor
sinner
,
who
is
now
going
to
take
his
death
,
<EOS>
for
whom
this
great
bell
doth
toll
<EOS>
_
.
 
<EOS>
"
_
You
who
are
condemned
to
die
,
repent
with
lamentable
tears
.
<EOS>
Ask
mercy
of
the
Lord
for
the
salvation
of
your
own
soul
,
through
the
merits
of
the
death
and
passion
of
Jesus
Christ
,
who
now
sits
at
the
right
hand
of
God
,
to
make
intercession
for
you
,
if
you
penitently
return
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
Lord
have
mercy
upon
you
_
!
"
 
<EOS>
This
ceremony
concluded
,
the
calvacade
was
again
put
in
motion
.
 
<EOS>
Slowly
descending
Snow
Hill
,
the
train
passed
on
its
way
,
attended
by
the
same
stunning
vociferations
,
cheers
,
yells
,
and
outcries
,
which
had
accompanied
it
on
starting
from
Newgate
.
<EOS>
The
guards
had
great
difficulty
in
preserving
a
clear
passage
without
resorting
to
severe
measures
,
for
the
tide
,
which
poured
upon
them
behind
,
around
,
in
front
,
and
at
all
sides
,
was
almost
irresistible
.
<EOS>
The
houses
on
Snow
Hill
were
thronged
,
like
those
in
Old
Bailey
.
<EOS>
Every
window
,
from
the
groundfloor
to
the
garret
had
its
occupant
,
and
the
roofs
were
covered
with
spectators
.
<EOS>
Words
of
encouragement
and
sympathy
were
addressed
to
Jack
,
who
,
as
he
looked
around
,
beheld
many
a
friendly
glance
fixed
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
way
,
they
reached
Holborn
Bridge
.
<EOS>
Here
a
little
delay
occurred
.
<EOS>
The
passage
was
so
narrow
that
there
was
only
sufficient
room
for
the
cart
to
pass
,
with
a
single
line
of
foot
-
soldiers
on
one
side
;
and
,
as
the
walls
of
the
bridge
were
covered
with
spectators
,
it
was
not
deemed
prudent
to
cross
it
till
these
persons
were
dislodged
.
 
<EOS>
While
this
was
effected
,
intelligence
was
brought
that
a
formidable
mob
was
pouring
down
Field
Lane
,
the
end
of
which
was
barricaded
.
<EOS>
The
advanced
guard
rode
on
to
drive
away
any
opposition
,
while
the
main
body
of
the
procession
crossed
the
bridge
,
and
slowly
toiled
up
Holborn
Hill
.
 
<EOS>
The
entrance
of
Shoe
Lane
,
and
the
whole
line
of
the
wall
of
St.
Andrew
's
church
,
the
bell
of
which
was
tolling
,
was
covered
with
spectators
.
<EOS>
Upon
the
steps
leading
to
the
gates
of
the
church
stood
two
persons
whom
Jack
instantly
recognised
.
<EOS>
These
were
his
mistresses
,
Poll
Maggot
and
Edgeworth
Bess
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
latter
beheld
him
,
she
uttered
a
loud
scream
,
and
fainted
.
<EOS>
She
was
caught
by
some
of
the
bystanders
,
who
offered
by
her
every
assistance
in
their
power
.
<EOS>
As
to
Mrs.
Maggot
,
whose
nerves
were
more
firmly
strung
,
she
contented
herself
with
waving
her
hand
affectionately
to
her
lover
,
and
encouraging
him
by
her
gestures
.
 
<EOS>
While
this
was
taking
place
,
another
and
more
serious
interruption
occurred
.
<EOS>
The
advanced
guard
had
endeavoured
to
disperse
the
mob
in
Field
Lane
,
but
were
not
prepared
to
meet
with
the
resistance
they
encountered
.
<EOS>
The
pavement
had
been
hastily
picked
up
,
and
heaped
across
the
end
of
the
street
,
upon
which
planks
,
barrels
,
and
other
barricades
,
were
laid
.
<EOS>
Most
of
the
mob
were
armed
with
pikes
,
staves
,
swords
,
muskets
,
and
other
weapons
,
and
offered
a
most
desperate
resistance
to
the
soldiery
,
whom
they
drove
back
with
a
shower
of
paving
-
stones
.
 
<EOS>
The
arrival
of
the
cart
at
the
end
of
Field
Lane
,
appeared
the
signal
for
an
attempt
at
rescue
.
<EOS>
With
a
loud
shout
,
and
headed
by
a
powerfully
-
built
man
,
with
a
face
as
black
as
that
of
a
mulatto
,
and
armed
with
a
cutlass
,
the
rabble
leapt
over
the
barricades
,
and
rushed
towards
the
vehicle
.
<EOS>
An
immediate
halt
took
place
.
<EOS>
The
soldiers
surrounded
the
cart
,
drew
their
swords
,
and
by
striking
the
rioters
first
with
the
blunt
edge
of
their
blades
,
and
afterwards
with
the
sharp
points
,
succeeded
in
driving
them
back
.
 
<EOS>
Amid
this
skirmish
Jonathan
greatly
distinguished
himself
.
<EOS>
Drawing
his
hanger
he
rode
amongst
the
crowd
,
trampled
upon
those
most
in
advance
,
and
made
an
attempt
to
seize
their
leader
,
in
whom
he
recognised
Blueskin
.
 
<EOS>
Baffled
in
their
attempt
,
the
mob
uttered
a
roar
,
such
as
only
a
thousand
angry
voices
can
utter
,
and
discharged
a
volley
of
missiles
at
the
soldiery
.
<EOS>
Stones
and
brickbats
were
showered
on
all
sides
,
and
Mr.
Marvel
was
almost
dislodged
from
his
seat
on
the
coffin
by
a
dead
dog
,
which
was
hurled
against
him
,
and
struck
him
in
the
face
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
however
,
by
dealing
blows
right
and
left
with
their
swords
,
and
even
inflicting
severe
cuts
on
the
foremost
of
the
rabble
,
the
soldiers
managed
to
gain
a
clear
course
,
and
to
drive
back
the
assailants
;
who
,
as
they
retreated
behind
the
barricades
,
shouted
in
tones
of
defiance
,
"
To
Tyburn
!
<EOS>
to
Tyburn
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
object
of
all
this
tumult
,
meanwhile
,
never
altered
his
position
,
but
sat
back
in
the
cart
,
as
if
resolved
not
to
make
even
a
struggle
to
regain
his
liberty
.
 
<EOS>
The
procession
now
wound
its
way
,
without
further
interruption
,
along
Holborn
.
<EOS>
Like
a
river
swollen
by
many
currents
,
it
gathered
force
from
the
various
avenues
that
poured
their
streams
into
it
.
<EOS>
Fetter
Lane
,
on
the
left
,
Gray
's
Inn
,
on
the
right
,
added
their
supplies
.
<EOS>
On
all
hands
Jack
was
cheered
,
and
Jonathan
hooted
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
the
train
approached
St.
Giles
's
.
<EOS>
Here
,
according
to
another
old
custom
,
already
alluded
to
,
a
criminal
taken
to
execution
was
allowed
to
halt
at
a
tavern
,
called
the
Crown
,
and
take
a
draught
from
St.
Giles
's
bowl
,
"
as
his
last
refreshment
on
earth
.
"
<EOS>
At
the
door
of
this
tavern
,
which
was
situated
on
the
left
of
the
street
,
not
more
than
a
hundred
yards
distant
from
the
church
,
the
bell
of
which
began
to
toll
as
soon
as
the
procession
came
in
sight
,
the
cart
drew
up
,
and
the
whole
cavalcade
halted
.
<EOS>
A
wooden
balcony
in
one
of
the
adjoining
houses
was
thronged
with
ladies
,
all
of
whom
appeared
to
take
a
lively
interest
in
the
scene
,
and
to
be
full
of
commiseration
for
the
criminal
,
not
,
perhaps
,
unmixed
with
admiration
of
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
Every
window
in
the
public
house
was
filled
with
guests
;
and
,
as
in
the
case
of
St.
Andrew
's
,
the
churchyard
wall
of
St.
Giles
's
was
lined
with
spectators
.
 
<EOS>
A
scene
now
ensued
,
highly
characteristic
of
the
age
,
and
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
The
doleful
procession
at
once
assumed
a
festive
character
.
<EOS>
Many
of
the
soldiers
dismounted
,
and
called
for
drink
.
<EOS>
Their
example
was
immediately
imitated
by
the
officers
,
constables
,
javelin
men
,
and
other
attendants
;
and
nothing
was
to
be
heard
but
shouts
of
laughter
and
jesting,--nothing
seen
but
the
passing
of
glasses
,
and
the
emptying
of
foaming
jugs
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Marvel
,
who
had
been
a
little
discomposed
by
the
treatment
he
had
experienced
on
Holborn
Hill
,
very
composedly
filled
and
lighted
his
pipe
.
 
<EOS>
One
group
at
the
door
attracted
Jack
's
attention
,
inasmuch
as
it
was
composed
of
several
of
his
old
acquaintances
--
Mr
.
Kneebone
,
Van
Galgebrok
,
and
Baptist
Kettleby
--
all
of
whom
greeted
him
cordially
.
<EOS>
Besides
these
,
there
was
a
sturdy
-
looking
fellow
,
whom
he
instantly
recognised
as
the
honest
blacksmith
who
had
freed
him
from
his
irons
at
Tottenham
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
here
,
you
see
,
"
said
the
smith
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
I
perceive
,
"
replied
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
the
landlord
of
the
Crown
,
a
jovial
-
looking
stout
personage
,
with
a
white
apron
round
his
waist
,
issued
from
the
house
,
bearing
a
large
wooden
bowl
filled
with
ale
,
which
he
offered
to
Jack
,
who
instantly
rose
to
receive
it
.
<EOS>
Raising
the
bowl
in
his
right
hand
,
Jack
glanced
towards
the
balcony
,
in
which
the
group
of
ladies
were
seated
,
and
begged
to
drink
their
healths
;
he
then
turned
to
Kneebone
and
the
others
,
who
extended
their
hands
towards
him
,
and
raised
it
to
his
lips
.
<EOS>
Just
as
he
was
about
to
drain
it
,
he
encountered
the
basilisk
glance
of
Jonathan
Wild
,
and
paused
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
leave
this
bowl
for
you
,
"
he
cried
,
returning
it
to
the
landlord
untasted
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
father
said
so
before
you
,
"
replied
Jonathan
,
malignantly
;
"
and
yet
it
has
tarried
thus
long
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
call
for
it
before
six
months
are
passed
,
"
rejoined
Jack
,
sternly
.
 
<EOS>
Once
again
the
cavalcade
was
in
motion
,
and
winding
its
way
by
St.
Giles
's
church
<EOS>
,
the
bell
of
which
continued
tolling
all
the
time
,
passed
the
pound
,
and
entered
Oxford
Road
,
or
,
as
it
was
then
not
unfrequently
termed
,
Tyburn
Road
.
<EOS>
After
passing
Tottenham
Court
Road
,
very
few
houses
were
to
be
seen
on
the
right
hand
,
opposite
Wardour
Street
it
was
open
country
.
 
<EOS>
The
crowd
now
dispersed
amongst
the
fields
,
and
thousands
of
persons
were
seen
hurrying
towards
Tyburn
as
fast
as
their
legs
could
carry
them
,
leaping
over
hedges
,
and
breaking
down
every
impediment
in
their
course
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
those
who
conducted
themselves
more
peaceably
,
the
conductors
of
the
procession
noticed
with
considerable
uneasiness
,
large
bands
of
men
armed
with
staves
,
bludgeons
,
and
other
weapons
,
who
were
flying
across
the
field
in
the
same
direction
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
feared
that
some
mischief
would
ensue
,
Wild
volunteered
,
if
he
were
allowed
a
small
body
of
men
,
to
ride
forward
to
Tyburn
,
and
keep
the
ground
clear
until
the
arrival
of
the
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
This
suggestion
being
approved
,
was
instantly
acted
upon
,
and
the
thief
-
taker
,
accompanied
by
a
body
of
the
grenadiers
,
rode
forward
.
 
<EOS>
The
train
,
meantime
,
had
passed
Marylebone
Lane
,
when
it
again
paused
for
a
moment
,
at
Jack
's
request
,
near
the
door
of
a
public
-
house
called
the
City
of
Oxford
.
 
<EOS>
Scarcely
had
it
come
to
a
halt
,
when
a
stalwart
man
shouldered
his
way
,
in
spite
of
their
opposition
,
through
the
lines
of
soldiery
to
the
cart
,
and
offered
his
large
horny
hand
to
the
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
I
would
call
to
bid
you
farewell
,
Mr.
Figg
,
"
said
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
you
did
,
"
replied
the
prize
-
fighter
.
<EOS>
"
Sorry
you
're
obliged
to
keep
your
word
.
<EOS>
Heard
of
your
last
escape

<EOS>
Hoped
you
'd
not
be
retaken
.
<EOS>
Never
sent
for
the
shirt
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
want
it
,
"
replied
Jack
;
"
but
who
are
those
gentlemen
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Friends
of
yours
,
"
replied
Figg
;
"
come
to
see
you;--Sir
James
Thornhill
,
Mr.
Hogarth
,
and
Mr.
Gay
.
<EOS>
They
send
you
every
good
wish
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Offer
them
my
hearty
thanks
,
"
replied
Jack
,
waving
his
hand
to
the
group
,
all
of
whom
returned
the
salutation
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
farewell
,
Mr.
Figg
!
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
,
all
will
be
over
.
"
 
<EOS>
Figg
turned
aside
to
hide
the
tears
that
started
to
his
eyes,--for
the
stout
prize
-
fighter
,
with
a
man
's
courage
,
had
a
woman
's
heart,--and
<EOS>
the
procession
again
set
forward
.

CHAPTER
XXXII
.
 
<EOS>
The
Closing
Scene
.
  
<EOS>
Tyburn
was
now
at
hand
.
<EOS>
Over
the
sea
of
heads
arose
a
black
and
dismal
object
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
gallows
.
<EOS>
Jack
,
whose
back
was
towards
it
,
did
not
see
it
;
but
he
heard
,
from
the
pitying
exclamations
of
the
crowd
,
that
it
was
in
view
.
<EOS>
This
circumstance
produced
no
further
alteration
in
his
demeanour
except
that
he
endeavoured
to
abstract
himself
from
the
surrounding
scene
,
and
bend
his
attention
to
the
prayers
which
the
ordinary
was
reciting
.
 
<EOS>
Just
as
he
had
succeeded
in
fixing
his
attention
,
it
was
again
shaken
,
and
he
was
almost
unnerved
by
the
sight
of
Mr.
Wood
,
who
was
standing
at
the
edge
of
a
raised
platform
,
anxiously
waving
his
hand
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
instantly
sprang
to
his
feet
,
and
as
his
guards
construed
the
motion
into
an
attempt
to
escape
,
several
of
them
drew
their
swords
and
motioned
to
him
to
sit
down
.
<EOS>
But
Jack
did
not
heed
them
.
<EOS>
His
looks
were
fixed
on
his
old
benefactor
.
 
<EOS>
"
God
in
Heaven
bless
you
,
unhappy
boy
!
"
<EOS>
cried
.
<EOS>
Wood
,
bursting
into
tears
,
"
God
bless
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
Jack
extended
his
hand
towards
him
,
and
looked
anxiously
for
Thames
;
but
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
.
<EOS>
A
severe
pang
shot
through
Jack
's
heart
,
and
he
would
have
given
worlds
if
he
possessed
them
to
have
seen
his
friend
once
more
.
<EOS>
The
wish
was
vain
:
and
,
endeavouring
to
banish
every
earthly
thought
,
he
addressed
himself
deeply
and
sincerely
to
prayer
.
 
<EOS>
While
this
was
passing
,
Jonathan
had
ridden
back
to
Marvel
to
tell
him
that
all
was
ready
,
and
to
give
him
his
last
instructions
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
'll
lose
no
time
,
"
said
the
thief
-
taker
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
hundred
pounds
if
you
do
it
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Rely
on
me
,
"
rejoined
the
executioner
,
throwing
away
his
pipe
,
which
was
just
finished
.
 
<EOS>
A
deep
dread
calm
,
like
that
which
precedes
a
thunderstorm
,
now
prevailed
amongst
the
assemblage
.
<EOS>
The
thousand
voices
which
a
few
moments
<EOS>
before
had
been
so
clamorous
were
now
hushed
.
<EOS>
Not
a
breath
was
drawn
.
<EOS>
The
troops
had
kept
a
large
space
clear
around
the
gallows
.
<EOS>
The
galleries
adjoining
it
were
crowded
with
spectators,--so
<EOS>
was
the
roof
of
a
large
tavern
<EOS>
,
then
the
only
house
standing
at
the
end
of
the
Edgeware
Road,--so
were
the
trees,--the
walls
of
Hyde
Park,--a
neighbouring
barn
,
a
shed,--in
short
,
every
available
position
.
 
<EOS>
The
cart
,
meantime
,
had
approached
the
fatal
tree
.
<EOS>
The
guards
,
horse
and
foot
,
and
constables
formed
a
wide
circle
round
it
to
keep
off
the
mob
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
awful
moment
--
so
awful
,
that
every
other
feeling
except
deep
interest
in
the
scene
seemed
suspended
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
terrible
juncture
,
Jack
maintained
his
composure,--a
smile
played
upon
his
face
before
the
cap
was
drawn
over
it,--and
<EOS>
the
last
words
he
uttered
were
,
"
My
poor
mother
!
<EOS>
I
shall
soon
join
her
!
"
<EOS>
The
rope
was
then
adjusted
,
and
the
cart
began
to
move
.
 
<EOS>
The
next
instant
,
he
was
launched
into
eternity
!
 
<EOS>
Scarcely
had
he
been
turned
off
a
moment
,
when
a
man
with
swarthy
features
leapt
into
the
cart
with
an
open
clasp
-
knife
in
his
hand
,
and
,
before
he
could
be
prevented
,
severed
the
rope
,
and
cut
down
the
body
.
<EOS>
It
was
Blueskin
.
<EOS>
His
assistance
came
too
late
.
<EOS>
A
ball
from
Wild
's
pistol
passed
through
his
heart
,
and
a
volley
of
musketry
poured
from
the
guards
lodged
several
balls
in
the
yet
breathing
body
of
his
leader
.
 
<EOS>
Blueskin
,
however
,
was
not
unattended
.
<EOS>
A
thousand
eager
assistants
pressed
behind
him
.
<EOS>
Jack
's
body
was
caught
,
and
passed
from
hand
to
hand
over
a
thousand
heads
,
till
it
was
far
from
the
fatal
tree
.
 
<EOS>
The
shouts
of
indignation
--
the
frightful
yells
now
raised
baffle
description
.
<EOS>
A
furious
attack
was
made
on
Jonathan
,
who
,
though
he
defended
himself
like
a
lion
,
was
desperately
wounded
,
and
would
inevitably
have
perished
if
he
had
not
been
protected
by
the
guards
,
who
were
obliged
to
use
both
swords
and
fire
-
arms
upon
the
mob
in
his
defence
.
<EOS>
He
was
at
length
rescued
from
his
assailants,--rescued
to
perish
,
seven
months
afterwards
,
with
every
ignominy
,
at
the
very
gibbet
to
which
he
had
brought
his
victim
.
 
<EOS>
The
body
of
Jack
Sheppard
,
meanwhile
,
was
borne
along
by
that
tremendous
host
,
which
rose
and
fell
like
the
waves
of
the
ocean
,
until
it
approached
the
termination
of
the
Edgeware
Road
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
point
a
carriage
with
servants
in
sumptuous
liveries
was
stationed
.
<EOS>
At
the
open
door
stood
a
young
man
in
a
rich
garb
with
a
mask
on
his
face
,
who
was
encouraging
the
mob
by
words
and
gestures
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
the
body
was
brought
towards
him
.
<EOS>
Instantly
seizing
it
,
the
young
man
placed
it
in
the
carriage
,
shut
the
door
,
and
commanded
his
servants
to
drive
off
.
<EOS>
The
order
was
promptly
obeyed
,
and
the
horses
proceeded
at
a
furious
pace
along
the
Edgeware
Road
.
 
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
afterwards
the
body
of
Jack
was
carefully
examined
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
cut
down
before
life
was
extinct
,
but
a
ball
from
one
of
the
soldiers
had
pierced
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
died
Jack
Sheppard
.
 
<EOS>
That
night
a
grave
was
dug
in
Willesden
churchyard
,
next
to
that
in
which
Mrs.
Sheppard
had
been
interred
.
<EOS>
Two
persons
,
besides
the
clergyman
and
sexton
,
alone
attended
the
ceremony
.
<EOS>
They
were
a
young
man
and
an
old
one
,
and
both
appeared
deeply
affected
.
<EOS>
The
coffin
was
lowered
into
the
grave
,
and
the
mourners
departed
.
<EOS>
A
simple
wooden
monument
was
placed
over
the
grave
,
but
without
any
name
or
date
.
<EOS>
In
after
years
,
some
pitying
hand
supplied
the
inscription
,
which
ran
thus--
