  
<EOS>
To
the
Right
Honourable
Mr.
Pitt
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
  
Never
poor
Wight
of
a
Dedicator
had
less
hopes
from
his
Dedication
,
than
I
have
from
this
of
mine
;
for
it
is
written
in
a
bye
corner
of
the
kingdom
,
and
in
a
retir'd
thatch'd
house
,
where
I
live
in
a
constant
endeavour
to
fence
against
the
infirmities
of
ill
health
,
and
other
evils
of
life
,
by
mirth
;
being
firmly
persuaded
that
every
time
a
man
smiles
,
 
but
much
more
so
,
when
he
laughs
,
it
adds
something
to
this
Fragment
of
Life
.
  
<EOS>
I
humbly
beg
,
Sir
,
that
you
will
honour
this
book
,
by
taking
it
 
(
not
under
your
Protection
,
 
it
must
protect
itself
,
but
)
 
into
the
country
with
you
;
where
,
if
I
am
ever
told
,
it
has
made
you
smile
;
or
can
conceive
it
has
beguiled
you
of
one
moment
's
pain
 
<EOS>
I
shall
think
myself
as
happy
as
a
minister
of
state
;
 
perhaps
much
happier
than
any
one
(
one
only
excepted
)
that
I
have
read
or
heard
of
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
,
Great
Sir
,
 
(
and
,
what
is
more
to
your
Honour
,
)
 
<EOS>
I
am
,
Good
Sir
,
 
Your
Well
-
wisher
,
 
and
most
humble
Fellow
-
subject
,
The
Author
.
      
<EOS>
I
wish
either
my
father
or
my
mother
,
or
indeed
both
of
them
,
as
they
were
in
duty
both
equally
bound
to
it
<EOS>
,
had
minded
what
they
were
about
when
they
begot
me
;
had
they
duly
consider'd
how
much
depended
upon
what
they
were
then
doing
;
 
that
not
only
the
production
of
a
rational
Being
was
concerned
in
it
,
but
that
possibly
the
happy
formation
and
temperature
of
his
body
,
perhaps
his
genius
and
the
very
cast
of
his
mind
;
 
and
,
for
aught
they
knew
to
the
contrary
,
even
the
fortunes
of
his
whole
house
might
take
their
turn
from
the
humours
and
dispositions
which
were
then
uppermost
;
 
<EOS>
Had
they
duly
weighed
and
considered
all
this
,
and
proceeded
accordingly
,
 
<EOS>
I
am
verily
persuaded
I
should
have
made
a
quite
different
figure
in
the
world
,
from
that
in
which
the
reader
is
likely
to
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
Believe
me
,
<EOS>
good
folks
,
this
is
not
so
inconsiderable
a
thing
as
many
of
you
may
think
it
;
 
<EOS>
you
have
all
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
heard
of
the
animal
spirits
,
as
how
they
are
transfused
from
father
to
son
,
&
c.
&
c.
 
and
a
great
deal
to
that
purpose
:
 
<EOS>
Well
,
you
may
take
my
word
,
that
nine
parts
in
ten
of
a
man
's
sense
or
his
nonsense
,
his
successes
and
miscarriages
in
this
world
depend
upon
their
motions
and
activity
,
and
the
different
tracks
and
trains
you
put
them
into
,
so
that
when
they
are
once
set
a
-
going
,
whether
right
or
wrong
,
'
tis
not
a
half-
penny
matter
,
 
away
they
go
cluttering
like
hey
-
go
mad
;
and
by
treading
the
same
steps
over
and
over
again
,
they
presently
make
a
road
of
it
,
as
plain
and
as
smooth
as
a
garden
-
walk
,
which
,
when
they
are
once
used
to
,
the
Devil
himself
sometimes
shall
not
be
able
to
drive
them
off
it
.
  
<EOS>
Pray
my
Dear
,
quoth
my
mother
,
have
you
not
forgot
to
wind
up
the
clock
?
  
<EOS>
Good
G
..
!
<EOS>
cried
my
father
,
making
an
exclamation
,
but
taking
care
to
moderate
his
voice
at
the
same
time
,
 
Did
ever
woman
,
since
the
creation
of
the
world
,
interrupt
a
man
with
such
a
silly
question
?
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
what
was
your
father
saying
?
 
<EOS>
Nothing
.
     
<EOS>
Then
,
positively
,
there
is
nothing
in
the
question
that
I
can
see
,
either
good
or
bad
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
let
me
tell
you
,
Sir
,
it
was
a
very
unseasonable
question
at
least
,
 
because
it
scattered
and
dispersed
the
animal
spirits
,
whose
business
it
was
to
have
escorted
and
gone
hand
in
hand
with
the
Homunculus
,
and
conducted
him
safe
to
the
place
destined
for
his
reception
.
  
<EOS>
The
Homunculus
,
Sir
,
in
however
low
and
ludicrous
a
light
he
may
appear
,
in
this
age
of
levity
,
to
the
eye
of
folly
or
prejudice
;
 
to
the
eye
of
reason
in
scientific
research
,
he
stands
confess'd
 
a
Being
guarded
and
circumscribed
with
rights
.
 
<EOS>
The
minutest
philosophers
,
who
by
the
bye
,
have
the
most
enlarged
understandings
,
(
their
souls
being
inversely
as
their
enquiries
)
<EOS>
shew
us
incontestably
,
that
the
Homunculus
is
created
by
the
same
hand
,
 
engender'd
<EOS>
in
the
same
course
of
nature
,
 
endow'd
with
the
same
loco
-
motive
powers
and
faculties
with
us
:
 
That
he
consists
as
we
do
,
of
skin
,
hair
,
fat
,
flesh
,
veins
,
arteries
,
ligaments
,
nerves
,
cartilages
,
bones
,
marrow
,
brains
,
glands
,
genitals
,
humours
,
and
articulations
;
 
is
a
Being
of
as
much
activity
,
 
and
in
all
senses
of
the
word
,
as
much
and
as
truly
our
fellow
-
creature
as
my
Lord
Chancellor
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
be
benefitted
,
 
he
may
be
injured
,
 
he
may
obtain
redress
;
in
a
word
,
he
has
all
the
claims
and
rights
of
humanity
,
which
Tully
,
Puffendorf
,
or
the
best
ethick
writers
allow
to
arise
out
of
that
state
and
relation
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
dear
Sir
,
what
if
any
accident
had
befallen
him
in
his
way
alone
!
 
<EOS>
or
that
through
terror
of
it
,
natural
to
so
young
a
traveller
,
my
little
Gentleman
had
got
to
his
journey
's
end
miserably
spent
;
 
<EOS>
his
muscular
strength
and
virility
worn
down
to
a
thread
;
 
his
own
animal
spirits
ruffled
beyond
description
,
 
and
that
in
this
sad
disorder'd
<EOS>
state
of
nerves
,
he
had
lain
down
a
prey
to
sudden
starts
,
or
a
series
of
melancholy
dreams
and
fancies
,
for
nine
long
,
long
months
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
tremble
to
think
what
a
foundation
had
been
laid
for
a
thousand
weaknesses
both
of
body
and
mind
,
which
no
skill
of
the
physician
or
the
philosopher
could
ever
afterwards
have
set
thoroughly
to
rights
.
     
<EOS>
To
my
uncle
<EOS>
Mr.
Toby
Shandy
<EOS>
do
I
stand
indebted
for
the
preceding
anecdote
,
to
whom
my
father
,
who
was
an
excellent
natural
philosopher
,
and
much
given
to
close
reasoning
upon
the
smallest
matters
,
had
oft
,
and
heavily
complained
of
the
injury
;
but
once
more
particularly
,
as
my
uncle
Toby
well
remember'd
,
upon
his
observing
a
most
unaccountable
obliquity
,
(
as
he
<EOS>
call'd
it
)
<EOS>
in
my
manner
of
setting
up
my
top
,
and
justifying
the
principles
upon
which
I
had
done
it
,
 
the
old
gentleman
shook
his
head
,
and
in
a
tone
more
expressive
by
half
of
sorrow
than
reproach
,
 
he
said
his
heart
all
along
foreboded
,
and
he
saw
it
verified
in
this
,
and
from
a
thousand
other
observations
he
had
made
upon
me
,
That
I
should
neither
think
nor
act
like
any
other
man
's
child
:
 
<EOS>
But
alas
!
<EOS>
continued
he
,
shaking
his
head
a
second
time
,
and
wiping
away
a
tear
which
was
trickling
down
his
cheeks
,
My
Tristram
's
misfortunes
began
nine
months
before
ever
he
came
into
the
world
.
    
<EOS>
My
mother
,
who
was
sitting
by
,
<EOS>
look'd
up
,
but
she
knew
no
more
than
her
backside
what
my
father
meant
,
 
but
my
uncle
,
Mr.
Toby
Shandy
,
who
had
been
often
informed
of
the
affair
,
 
understood
him
very
well
.
    
<EOS>
I
know
there
are
readers
in
the
world
,
as
well
as
many
other
good
people
in
it
,
who
are
no
readers
at
all
,
 
who
find
themselves
ill
at
ease
,
unless
they
are
let
into
the
whole
secret
from
first
to
last
,
of
every
thing
which
concerns
you
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
in
pure
compliance
with
this
humour
of
theirs
,
and
from
a
backwardness
in
my
nature
to
disappoint
any
one
soul
living
,
that
I
have
been
so
very
particular
already
.
 
<EOS>
As
my
life
and
opinions
are
likely
to
make
some
noise
in
the
world
,
and
,
if
I
conjecture
right
,
will
take
in
all
ranks
,
professions
,
and
denominations
of
men
whatever
,
 
be
no
less
read
than
the
Pilgrim
's
Progress
itself
 
and
in
the
end
,
prove
the
very
thing
which
Montaigne
dreaded
his
Essays
should
turn
out
,
that
is
,
a
book
for
a
parlour
-
window
;
 
I
find
it
necessary
to
consult
every
one
a
little
in
his
turn
;
and
therefore
must
beg
pardon
for
going
on
a
little
farther
in
the
same
way
:
 
For
which
cause
,
right
glad
I
am
,
that
I
have
begun
the
history
of
myself
in
the
way
I
have
done
;
and
that
I
am
able
to
go
on
,
tracing
every
thing
in
it
,
as
Horace
says
,
ab
Ovo
.
  
<EOS>
Horace
,
I
know
,
does
not
recommend
this
fashion
altogether
:
 
<EOS>
But
that
gentleman
is
speaking
only
of
an
epic
poem
or
a
tragedy
;
 
<EOS>
(
I
forget
which
,
)
<EOS>
besides
,
if
it
was
not
so
,
I
should
beg
Mr.
Horace
's
pardon
;
 
for
in
writing
what
I
have
set
about
,
I
shall
confine
myself
neither
to
his
rules
,
nor
to
any
man
's
rules
that
ever
lived
.
  
<EOS>
To
such
however
as
do
not
choose
to
go
so
far
back
into
these
things
,
I
can
give
no
better
advice
than
that
they
skip
over
the
remaining
part
of
this
chapter
;
for
I
declare
before
-
hand
,
'
tis
wrote
only
for
the
curious
and
inquisitive
.
    
<EOS>
Shut
the
door
.
    
<EOS>
I
was
begot
in
the
night
betwixt
the
first
Sunday
and
the
first
Monday
in
the
month
of
March
,
in
the
year
of
our
Lord
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
eighteen
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
positive
I
was
.
 
<EOS>
But
how
I
came
to
be
so
very
particular
in
my
account
of
a
thing
which
happened
before
I
was
born
,
is
owing
to
another
small
anecdote
known
only
in
our
own
family
,
but
now
made
publick
for
the
better
clearing
up
this
point
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
,
you
must
know
,
who
was
originally
a
Turkey
merchant
,
but
had
left
off
business
for
some
years
,
in
order
to
retire
to
,
and
die
upon
,
his
paternal
estate
in
the
county
of
  
,
was
,
I
believe
,
one
of
the
most
regular
men
in
every
thing
he
did
,
whether
'
twas
matter
of
business
,
or
matter
of
amusement
,
that
ever
lived
.
 
<EOS>
As
a
small
specimen
of
this
extreme
exactness
of
his
,
to
which
he
was
in
truth
a
slave
,
he
had
made
it
a
rule
for
many
years
of
his
life
,
 
on
the
first
Sunday
-
night
of
every
month
throughout
the
whole
year
,
 
as
certain
as
ever
the
Sunday
-
night
came
,
 
to
wind
up
a
large
house
-
clock
,
which
we
had
standing
on
the
back
-
stairs
head
,
with
his
own
hands
:
 
And
being
somewhere
between
fifty
and
sixty
years
of
age
at
the
time
I
have
been
speaking
of
,
 
<EOS>
he
had
likewise
gradually
brought
some
other
little
family
concernments
to
the
same
period
,
in
order
,
as
he
would
often
say
to
my
uncle
Toby
,
to
get
them
all
out
of
the
way
at
one
time
,
and
be
no
more
plagued
and
pestered
with
them
the
rest
of
the
month
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
attended
but
with
one
misfortune
,
which
,
in
a
great
measure
,
fell
upon
myself
,
and
the
effects
of
which
I
fear
I
shall
carry
with
me
to
my
grave
;
namely
,
that
from
an
unhappy
association
of
ideas
,
which
have
no
connection
in
nature
,
it
so
fell
out
at
length
,
that
my
poor
mother
could
never
hear
the
said
clock
wound
up
,
 
but
the
thoughts
of
some
other
things
unavoidably
popped
into
her
head
 
&
vice
versa
:
 
<EOS>
Which
strange
combination
of
ideas
,
the
sagacious
Locke
,
who
certainly
understood
the
nature
of
these
things
better
than
most
men
,
affirms
to
have
produced
more
wry
actions
than
all
other
sources
of
prejudice
whatsoever
.
  
<EOS>
But
this
by
the
bye
.
  
<EOS>
Now
it
appears
by
a
memorandum
in
my
father
's
pocket
-
book
,
which
now
lies
upon
the
table
,
"
That
on
Lady
-
day
,
which
was
on
the
25th
of
the
same
month
in
which
I
date
my
geniture
,
 
my
father
set
upon
his
journey
to
London
,
with
my
eldest
brother
Bobby
,
to
fix
him
at
Westminster
school
;
"
and
,
as
it
appears
from
the
same
authority
,
"
That
he
did
not
get
down
to
his
wife
and
family
till
the
second
week
in
May
following
,
"
 
it
brings
the
thing
almost
to
a
certainty
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
what
follows
in
the
beginning
of
the
next
chapter
,
puts
it
beyond
all
possibility
of
a
doubt
.
    
<EOS>
But
pray
,
Sir
,
What
was
your
father
doing
all
December
,
January
,
and
February
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
Madam
,
 
he
was
all
that
time
afflicted
with
a
Sciatica
.
     
<EOS>
On
the
fifth
day
of
November
,
1718
,
which
to
the
aera
fixed
on
,
was
as
near
nine
kalendar
months
as
any
husband
could
in
reason
have
expected
,
 
was
I
<EOS>
Tristram
Shandy
,
Gentleman
,
brought
forth
into
this
scurvy
and
disastrous
world
of
ours
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
been
born
in
the
Moon
,
or
in
any
of
the
planets
,
(
except
Jupiter
or
Saturn
,
because
I
never
could
bear
cold
weather
)
for
it
could
not
well
have
fared
worse
with
me
in
any
of
them
(
though
I
will
not
answer
for
Venus
)
than
it
has
in
this
vile
,
dirty
planet
of
ours
,
 
<EOS>
which
,
o
'
my
conscience
,
with
reverence
be
it
spoken
,
I
take
to
be
made
up
of
the
shreds
and
clippings
of
the
rest
;
 
not
<EOS>
but
the
planet
is
well
enough
,
provided
a
man
could
be
born
in
it
to
a
great
title
or
to
a
great
estate
;
or
could
any
how
contrive
to
be
called
up
to
public
charges
,
and
employments
of
dignity
or
power
;
 
but
that
is
not
my
case
;
 
and
therefore
every
man
will
speak
of
the
fair
as
his
own
market
has
gone
in
it
;
 
for
which
<EOS>
cause
I
affirm
it
over
again
to
be
one
of
the
vilest
worlds
that
ever
was
made
;
 
<EOS>
for
I
can
truly
say
,
that
from
the
first
hour
I
drew
my
breath
in
it
,
to
this
,
that
I
can
now
scarce
draw
it
at
all
<EOS>
,
for
an
asthma
I
got
in
scating
against
the
wind
in
Flanders
;
 
I
have
been
the
continual
sport
of
what
the
world
calls
Fortune
;
and
though
I
will
not
wrong
her
by
saying
,
She
has
ever
made
me
feel
the
weight
of
any
great
or
signal
evil
;
 
yet
with
all
the
good
temper
in
the
world
I
affirm
it
of
her
,
that
in
every
stage
of
my
life
,
and
at
every
turn
and
corner
where
she
could
get
fairly
at
me
,
the
ungracious
duchess
has
pelted
me
with
a
set
of
as
pitiful
misadventures
and
cross
accidents
as
ever
small
Hero
sustained
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
beginning
of
the
last
chapter
,
I
informed
you
exactly
when
I
was
born
;
but
I
did
not
inform
you
how
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
that
particular
was
reserved
entirely
for
a
chapter
by
itself
;
 
besides
,
Sir
,
as
you
and
I
are
in
a
manner
perfect
strangers
to
each
other
,
it
would
not
have
been
proper
to
have
let
you
into
too
many
circumstances
relating
to
myself
all
at
once
.
    
<EOS>
You
must
have
a
little
patience
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
undertaken
,
you
see
,
to
write
not
only
my
life
,
but
<EOS>
my
opinions
also
;
hoping
and
expecting
that
your
knowledge
of
my
character
,
and
of
what
kind
of
a
mortal
I
am
,
by
the
one
,
would
give
you
a
better
relish
for
the
other
:
 
As
you
proceed
farther
with
me
,
the
slight
acquaintance
,
which
is
now
beginning
betwixt
us
,
will
grow
into
familiarity
;
and
that
unless
one
of
us
is
in
fault
,
will
terminate
in
friendship
.
 
<EOS>
O
diem
praeclarum
!
 
<EOS>
then
nothing
which
has
touched
me
will
be
thought
trifling
in
its
nature
,
or
tedious
in
its
telling
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
my
dear
friend
and
companion
,
if
you
should
think
me
somewhat
sparing
of
my
narrative
on
my
first
setting
out
 
bear
with
me
,
 
and
let
me
go
on
,
and
tell
my
story
my
own
way
:
 
<EOS>
Or
,
if
I
should
seem
now
and
then
to
trifle
upon
the
road
,
 
or
should
sometimes
put
on
a
fool
's
cap
with
a
bell
to
it
,
for
a
moment
or
two
as
we
pass
along
<EOS>
,
 
do
n't
fly
off
,
 
but
rather
courteously
give
me
credit
for
a
little
more
wisdom
than
appears
upon
my
outside
;
 
and
as
we
jog
on
,
either
laugh
with
me
,
or
at
me
,
or
in
short
do
any
thing
,
  
only
keep
your
temper
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
same
village
where
my
father
and
my
mother
dwelt
,
dwelt
also
a
thin
,
upright
,
motherly
,
notable
,
good
old
body
of
a
midwife
,
who
with
the
help
of
a
little
plain
good
sense
,
and
some
years
full
employment
in
her
business
,
in
which
she
had
all
along
trusted
little
to
her
own
efforts
,
and
a
great
deal
to
those
of
dame
Nature
,
 
had
acquired
,
in
her
way
,
no
small
degree
of
reputation
in
the
world
:
 
by
which
word
world
,
need
I
in
this
place
inform
your
worship
,
that
I
would
be
understood
to
mean
no
more
of
it
,
than
a
small
circle
described
upon
the
circle
of
the
great
world
,
of
four
English
miles
diameter
,
or
thereabouts
,
of
which
the
cottage
where
the
good
old
woman
lived
is
supposed
to
be
the
centre
?
 
<EOS>
She
had
been
left
<EOS>
it
seems
a
widow
in
great
distress
,
with
three
or
four
small
children
,
in
her
forty
-
seventh
year
;
and
as
she
was
at
that
time
a
person
of
decent
carriage
,
 
grave
deportment
,
 
<EOS>
a
woman
moreover
of
few
words
and
withal
an
object
of
compassion
,
whose
distress
,
and
silence
under
it
,
called
out
the
louder
for
a
friendly
lift
:
 
the
wife
of
the
parson
of
the
parish
was
touched
with
pity
;
and
having
often
lamented
an
inconvenience
to
which
her
husband
's
flock
had
for
many
years
been
exposed
,
inasmuch
as
there
was
no
such
thing
as
a
midwife
,
of
any
kind
or
degree
,
to
be
got
at
,
let
the
case
have
been
never
so
urgent
,
within
less
than
six
or
seven
long
miles
riding
;
which
said
seven
long
miles
in
dark
nights
and
dismal
roads
,
the
country
thereabouts
being
nothing
but
a
deep
clay
,
was
almost
equal
to
fourteen
;
and
that
in
effect
was
sometimes
next
to
having
no
midwife
at
all
<EOS>
;
it
came
into
her
head
,
that
it
would
be
doing
as
seasonable
a
kindness
to
the
whole
parish
,
as
to
the
poor
creature
herself
,
to
get
her
a
little
instructed
in
some
of
the
plain
principles
of
the
business
,
in
order
to
set
her
up
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
As
no
woman
thereabouts
was
better
qualified
to
execute
the
plan
she
had
formed
than
herself
,
the
gentlewoman
very
charitably
undertook
it
;
and
having
great
influence
over
the
female
part
of
the
parish
,
she
found
no
difficulty
in
effecting
it
to
the
utmost
of
her
wishes
.
 
<EOS>
In
truth
,
the
parson
join'd
his
interest
with
his
wife
's
in
the
whole
affair
,
and
in
order
to
do
things
as
they
should
be
,
and
give
the
poor
soul
as
good
a
title
by
law
to
practise
,
as
his
wife
had
given
by
institution
,
 
he
cheerfully
paid
the
fees
for
the
ordinary
's
licence
himself
,
amounting
in
the
whole
,
to
the
sum
of
eighteen
shillings
and
four
pence
;
so
that
betwixt
them
both
,
the
good
woman
was
fully
invested
in
the
real
and
corporal
possession
of
her
office
,
together
with
all
its
rights
,
members
,
and
appurtenances
whatsoever
.
  
<EOS>
These
last
words
,
you
must
know
,
were
not
according
to
the
old
form
in
which
such
licences
,
faculties
,
and
powers
usually
ran
,
which
in
like
cases
had
heretofore
been
granted
to
the
sisterhood
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
according
to
a
neat
Formula
of
Didius
<EOS>
his
own
devising
,
who
having
a
particular
turn
for
taking
to
pieces
,
and
new
framing
over
again
all
kind
of
instruments
in
that
way
,
not
only
hit
upon
this
dainty
amendment
,
but
coaxed
many
of
the
old
licensed
matrons
in
the
neighbourhood
,
to
open
their
faculties
afresh
,
in
order
to
have
this
wham
-
wham
of
his
inserted
.
   
<EOS>
I
own
<EOS>
I
never
could
envy
Didius
in
these
kinds
of
fancies
of
his
:
 
But
<EOS>
every
man
to
his
own
taste
.
 
<EOS>
Did
not
Dr.
Kunastrokius
,
that
great
man
,
at
his
leisure
hours
,
take
the
greatest
delight
imaginable
in
combing
of
asses
tails
,
and
plucking
the
dead
hairs
out
with
his
teeth
,
though
he
had
tweezers
always
in
his
pocket
?
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
if
you
come
to
that
,
Sir
,
have
not
the
wisest
of
men
in
all
ages
,
not
excepting
Solomon
himself
,
 
<EOS>
have
they
not
had
their
Hobby
-
Horses
;
 
<EOS>
their
running
horses
,
 
their
coins
and
their
cockle
-
shells
,
their
drums
and
their
trumpets
,
their
fiddles
,
their
pallets
,
 
their
maggots
and
their
butterflies
?
 
<EOS>
and
so
long
as
a
man
rides
his
Hobby
-
Horse
peaceably
and
quietly
along
the
King
's
highway
,
and
neither
compels
<EOS>
you
or
me
to
get
up
behind
him
,
 
pray
<EOS>
,
Sir
,
what
have
either
you
or
I
to
do
with
it
?
      
<EOS>
De
gustibus
non
est
disputandum
;
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
there
is
no
disputing
against
Hobby
-
Horses
;
and
for
my
part
,
I
seldom
do
;
nor
could
I
with
any
sort
of
grace
,
<EOS>
had
I
been
an
enemy
to
them
at
the
bottom
;
for
happening
,
at
certain
intervals
and
changes
of
the
moon
,
to
be
both
fidler
and
painter
,
according
as
the
fly
stings
:
 
Be
it
known
to
you
,
that
I
keep
a
couple
of
pads
myself
,
upon
which
,
in
their
turns
,
(
nor
do
I
care
who
knows
it
)
<EOS>
I
frequently
ride
out
and
take
the
air
;
 
though
sometimes
,
to
my
shame
<EOS>
be
<EOS>
it
spoken
<EOS>
,
I
take
somewhat
longer
journies
than
what
a
wise
man
would
think
altogether
right
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
truth
is
,
 
I
am
not
a
wise
man
;
 
and
besides
am
a
mortal
of
so
little
consequence
in
the
world
,
<EOS>
it
is
not
much
matter
what
I
do
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
seldom
fret
or
fume
at
all
about
it
:
 
<EOS>
Nor
does
it
much
disturb
my
rest
,
when
I
see
such
great
Lords
and
tall
Personages
as
hereafter
follow
;
 
<EOS>
such
,
for
instance
,
as
my
Lord
A
,
B
,
C
,
D
,
E
,
F
,
G
,
H
,
I
,
K
,
L
,
M
,
N
,
O
,
P
,
Q
,
and
so
on
,
all
of
a
row
,
mounted
upon
their
several
horses
,
  
some
with
large
stirrups
,
getting
on
in
a
more
grave
and
sober
pace
;
  
others
on
the
contrary
,
tucked
up
to
their
very
chins
,
with
whips
across
their
mouths
,
scouring
and
scampering
it
away
like
so
many
little
party-
coloured
devils
astride
a
mortgage
,
 
<EOS>
and
as
if
some
of
them
were
resolved
to
break
their
necks
.
 
<EOS>
So
much
the
better
 
say
I
to
myself
;
 
for
in
case
the
worst
should
happen
,
the
world
will
make
a
shift
to
do
excellently
well
without
them
;
and
for
the
rest
,
 
why
 
God
speed
them
 
<EOS>
e'en
let
them
ride
on
without
opposition
from
me
;
for
were
their
lordships
unhorsed
this
very
night
 
<EOS>
'
tis
ten
to
one
but
that
many
of
them
would
be
worse
mounted
by
one
half
before
tomorrow
morning
.
  
<EOS>
Not
one
of
these
instances
therefore
can
be
said
to
break
in
upon
my
rest
.
  
<EOS>
But
there
is
an
instance
,
which
I
own
<EOS>
puts
me
off
my
guard
,
and
that
is
,
when
I
see
one
born
for
great
actions
,
and
what
is
still
more
for
his
honour
,
whose
nature
ever
inclines
him
to
good
ones
;
 
when
I
behold
such
a
one
,
my
Lord
,
like
yourself
,
whose
principles
and
conduct
are
as
generous
and
noble
as
his
blood
,
and
whom
,
for
that
reason
,
a
corrupt
world
can
not
spare
one
moment
;
 
when
I
see
such
a
one
,
my
Lord
,
mounted
,
though
it
is
but
for
a
minute
beyond
the
time
which
my
love
to
my
country
has
prescribed
to
him
,
and
my
zeal
for
his
glory
wishes
,
 
then
,
<EOS>
my
Lord
,
I
cease
to
be
a
philosopher
,
and
in
the
first
transport
of
an
honest
impatience
,
I
wish
the
Hobby
-
Horse
,
with
all
his
fraternity
,
at
the
Devil
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
Lord
,
I
maintain
this
to
be
a
dedication
,
notwithstanding
its
singularity
in
the
three
great
essentials
of
matter
,
form
and
place
:
 
<EOS>
I
beg
,
therefore
,
you
will
accept
it
as
such
,
and
that
you
will
permit
me
to
lay
it
,
with
the
most
respectful
humility
,
at
your
Lordship
's
feet
 
when
you
are
upon
them
,
 
which
you
can
be
when
you
please
;
 
and
that
is
,
my
Lord
,
whenever
there
is
occasion
for
it
,
and
I
will
add
,
to
the
best
purposes
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
the
honour
to
be
,
 
<EOS>
My
Lord
,
 
Your
Lordship
's
most
obedient
,
and
most
devoted
,
and
most
humble
servant
,
Tristram
Shandy
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
I
solemnly
declare
to
all
mankind
,
that
the
above
dedication
was
made
for
no
one
Prince
,
Prelate
,
Pope
,
or
Potentate
,
 
Duke
,
Marquis
,
Earl
,
Viscount
,
or
Baron
,
of
this
,
or
any
other
Realm
in
Christendom
;
 
nor
has
it
yet
been
hawked
about
,
or
offered
publicly
or
privately
,
directly
or
indirectly
,
to
any
one
person
or
personage
,
great
or
small
;
but
is
honestly
a
true
Virgin-
Dedication
untried
on
,
upon
any
soul
living
.
   
<EOS>
I
labour
this
point
so
particularly
,
merely
to
remove
any
offence
or
objection
which
might
arise
against
it
from
the
manner
in
which
I
propose
to
make
the
most
of
it
;
 
<EOS>
which
is
the
putting
it
up
fairly
to
public
sale
;
which
I
now
do
.
    
<EOS>
Every
author
has
a
way
of
his
own
in
bringing
his
points
to
bear
;
 
for
my
own
part
,
as
I
hate
chaffering
and
higgling
for
a
few
guineas
in
a
dark
entry
;
 
I
resolved
within
myself
,
from
the
very
beginning
,
to
deal
squarely
and
openly
with
your
Great
Folks
in
this
affair
,
and
try
whether
I
should
not
come
off
the
better
by
it
.
  
<EOS>
If
therefore
there
is
any
one
Duke
,
Marquis
,
Earl
,
Viscount
,
or
Baron
,
in
these
his
Majesty
's
dominions
,
who
stands
in
need
of
a
tight
,
genteel
dedication
,
and
whom
the
above
will
suit
,
(
for
by
the
bye
,
unless
it
suits
in
some
degree
,
I
will
not
part
with
it
)
 
<EOS>
it
is
much
at
his
service
for
fifty
guineas
;
 
<EOS>
which
I
am
positive
is
twenty
guineas
less
than
it
ought
to
be
afforded
for
,
by
any
man
of
genius
.
  
<EOS>
My
Lord
,
if
you
examine
it
over
again
,
it
is
far
from
being
a
gross
piece
of
daubing
,
as
some
dedications
are
.
 
<EOS>
The
design
,
your
Lordship
sees
,
is
good
,
 
the
colouring
transparent
,
 
<EOS>
the
drawing
not
amiss
;
 
or
to
speak
more
like
a
man
of
science
,
 
and
measure
my
piece
in
the
painter
's
scale
,
divided
into
20
,
 
I
believe
,
my
Lord
,
the
outlines
will
turn
out
as
12
,
  
the
composition
as
9
,
 
the
colouring
as
6
,
 
the
expression
13
and
a
half
,
  
and
the
design
,
 
if
I
may
be
allowed
,
<EOS>
my
Lord
,
to
understand
my
own
design
,

Besides
all
this

is
keeping

the
dark

in

give

there
is

Bright

<EOS>
Whatever
degree
of
small
merit
the
act
of
benignity
in
favour
of
the
midwife
might
justly
claim
,
or
in
whom
that
claim
truly
rested
,
 
at
first
sight
seems
not
very
material
to
this
history
;
 
certain
however
it
was
,
that
the
gentlewoman
,
the
parson
's
wife
,
did
run
away
at
that
time
with
the
whole
of
it
:
 
<EOS>
And
yet
,
for
my
life
,
I
can
not
help
thinking
but
that
the
parson
himself
,
though
he
had
not
the
good
fortune
to
hit
upon
the
design
first
,
 
yet
,
as
he
heartily
concurred
in
it
the
moment
it
was
laid
before
him
,
and
as
heartily
parted
with
his
money
to
carry
it
into
execution
,
had
a
claim
to
some
share
of
it
,
 
if
not
to
a
full
half
of
whatever
honour
was
due
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
world
at
that
time
was
pleased
to
determine
the
matter
otherwise
.
  
<EOS>
Lay
down
the
book
,
and
I
will
allow
you
half
a
day
to
give
a
probable
guess
at
the
grounds
of
this
procedure
.
  
<EOS>
Be
it
known
then
,
that
,
for
about
five
years
before
the
date
of
the
midwife
's
licence
,
of
which
you
have
had
so
circumstantial
an
account
,
 
the
parson
we
have
to
do
with
had
made
himself
a
country
-
talk
by
a
breach
of
all
decorum
,
which
he
had
committed
against
himself
,
his
station
,
and
his
office
;
 
and
that
was
in
never
appearing
better
,
or
otherwise
mounted
,
than
upon
a
lean
,
sorry
,
jackass
of
a
horse
,
value
about
one
pound
fifteen
shillings
;
who
,
to
shorten
all
description
of
him
,
was
full
brother
to
Rosinante
,
as
far
as
similitude
congenial
could
make
him
;
for
he
answered
his
description
to
a
hair
-
breadth
in
every
thing
,
 
except
that
I
do
not
remember
'
tis
any
where
said
,
that
Rosinante
was
broken
-
winded
;
and
that
,
moreover
,
Rosinante
,
as
is
the
happiness
of
most
Spanish
horses
,
fat
or
lean
,
 
was
undoubtedly
a
horse
at
all
points
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
very
well
that
the
Hero
's
horse
was
a
horse
of
chaste
deportment
,
which
may
have
given
grounds
for
the
contrary
opinion
:
 
<EOS>
But
it
is
as
certain
at
the
same
time
that
Rosinante
's
continency
(
as
may
be
demonstrated
from
the
adventure
of
the
Yanguesian
carriers
)
<EOS>
proceeded
from
no
bodily
defect
or
cause
whatsoever
,
but
from
the
temperance
and
orderly
current
of
his
blood
.
 
<EOS>
And
let
me
tell
you
,
Madam
,
there
is
a
great
deal
of
very
good
chastity
in
the
world
,
in
behalf
of
which
you
could
not
say
more
for
your
life
.
  
<EOS>
Let
that
be
as
it
may
,
as
my
purpose
is
to
do
exact
justice
to
every
creature
brought
upon
the
stage
of
this
dramatic
work
,
 
I
could
not
stifle
this
distinction
in
favour
of
Don
Quixote
's
horse
;
 
in
all
other
points
,
the
parson
's
horse
<EOS>
,
I
say
,
was
just
such
another
,
for
he
was
as
lean
,
and
as
lank
,
and
as
sorry
a
jade
,
as
Humility
herself
could
have
bestrided
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
estimation
of
here
and
there
a
man
of
weak
judgment
,
it
was
greatly
in
the
parson
's
power
to
have
helped
the
figure
of
this
horse
of
his
,
 
for
he
was
master
of
a
very
handsome
demi
-
peaked
saddle
,
quilted
on
the
seat
with
green
plush
,
garnished
with
a
double
row
of
silver
-
headed
studs
,
and
a
noble
pair
of
shining
brass
stirrups
,
with
a
housing
altogether
suitable
,
of
grey
superfine
cloth
,
with
an
edging
of
black
lace
,
terminating
in
a
deep
,
black
,
silk
fringe
,
poudre
d'or
,
 
all
which
he
had
purchased
in
the
pride
and
prime
of
his
life
,
together
with
a
grand
embossed
bridle
,
ornamented
at
all
points
as
it
should
be
.
 
<EOS>
But
not
caring
to
banter
his
beast
,
he
had
hung
all
these
up
behind
his
study
door
:
 
and
,
in
lieu
of
them
,
had
seriously
befitted
him
with
just
such
a
bridle
and
such
a
saddle
,
as
the
figure
and
value
of
such
a
steed
might
well
and
truly
deserve
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
several
sallies
about
his
parish
,
and
in
the
neighbouring
visits
to
the
gentry
who
lived
around
him
,
 
you
will
easily
comprehend
,
that
the
parson
,
so
appointed
,
would
both
hear
and
see
enough
to
keep
his
philosophy
from
rusting
.
 
<EOS>
To
speak
the
truth
,
he
never
could
enter
a
village
,
but
he
caught
the
attention
of
both
old
and
young
.
 
<EOS>
Labour
stood
still
as
he
pass'd
 
<EOS>
the
bucket
hung
suspended
in
the
middle
of
the
well
,
 
the
spinning-
wheel
forgot
its
round
,
 
even
chuck
-
farthing
and
shuffle
-
cap
<EOS>
themselves
stood
gaping
till
he
had
got
out
of
sight
;
and
as
his
movement
was
not
of
the
quickest
,
he
had
generally
time
enough
upon
his
hands
to
make
his
observations
,
 
to
hear
the
groans
of
the
serious
,
 
and
the
laughter
of
the
light
-
hearted
;
all
which
he
bore
with
excellent
tranquillity
.
 
<EOS>
His
character
was
,
 
he
loved
a
jest
in
his
heart
 
<EOS>
and
as
he
saw
himself
in
the
true
point
of
ridicule
,
he
would
say
he
could
not
be
angry
with
others
for
seeing
him
in
a
light
,
in
which
he
so
strongly
saw
himself
:
 
<EOS>
So
that
to
his
friends
,
who
knew
his
foible
was
not
the
love
of
money
,
and
who
therefore
made
the
less
scruple
in
bantering
the
extravagance
of
his
humour
,
 
instead
of
giving
the
true
cause
,
 
he
chose
rather
to
join
in
the
laugh
against
himself
;
and
as
he
never
carried
one
single
ounce
of
flesh
upon
his
own
bones
,
being
altogether
as
spare
a
figure
as
his
beast
,
 
he
would
sometimes
insist
upon
it
,
that
the
horse
was
as
good
as
the
rider
deserved
;
 
that
they
were
,
centaur
-
like
,
 
both
of
a
piece
.
 
<EOS>
At
other
times
,
and
in
other
moods
,
when
his
spirits
were
above
the
temptation
of
false
wit
,
 
he
would
say
,
he
found
himself
going
off
fast
in
a
consumption
;
and
,
with
great
gravity
,
would
pretend
,
he
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
a
fat
horse
,
without
a
dejection
of
heart
,
and
a
sensible
alteration
in
his
pulse
;
and
that
he
had
made
choice
of
the
lean
one
he
rode
upon
,
not
only
to
keep
himself
in
countenance
,
but
in
spirits
.
  
<EOS>
At
different
times
he
would
give
fifty
humorous
and
apposite
reasons
for
riding
a
meek
-
spirited
jade
of
a
broken
-
winded
horse
,
preferably
to
one
of
mettle
;
 
for
on
such
a
one
he
could
sit
mechanically
,
and
meditate
as
delightfully
de
vanitate
mundi
et
fuga
faeculi
,
as
with
the
advantage
of
a
death's
-
head
before
him
;
 
that
,
in
all
other
exercitations
,
he
could
spend
his
time
,
as
he
rode
slowly
along
,
 
to
as
much
account
as
in
his
study
;
  
that
he
could
draw
up
an
argument
in
his
sermon
,
 
or
a
hole
in
his
breeches
,
as
steadily
on
the
one
as
in
the
other
;
 
that
brisk
trotting
and
slow
argumentation
,
like
wit
and
judgment
,
were
two
incompatible
movements
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
upon
his
steed
 
he
could
unite
and
reconcile
every
thing
,
 
<EOS>
he
could
compose
his
sermon
 
<EOS>
he
could
compose
his
cough
,
 
and
,
in
case
nature
gave
a
call
that
way
,
he
could
likewise
compose
himself
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
the
parson
upon
such
encounters
would
assign
any
cause
but
the
true
cause
,
 
and
he
with
-
held
the
true
one
,
only
out
of
a
nicety
of
temper
,
because
he
thought
it
did
honour
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
truth
of
the
story
was
as
follows
:
 
<EOS>
In
the
first
years
of
this
gentleman
's
life
,
and
about
the
time
when
the
superb
saddle
and
bridle
were
purchased
by
him
,
it
had
been
his
manner
,
or
vanity
,
or
call
it
what
you
will
,
 
to
run
into
the
opposite
extreme
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
language
of
the
county
where
he
dwelt
,
he
was
said
to
have
loved
a
good
horse
,
and
generally
had
one
of
the
best
in
the
whole
parish
standing
in
his
stable
always
ready
for
saddling
:
and
as
the
nearest
midwife
,
as
I
told
you
,
did
not
live
nearer
to
the
village
than
seven
miles
,
and
in
a
vile
country
,
 
it
so
fell
out
that
the
poor
gentleman
was
scarce
a
whole
week
together
without
some
piteous
application
for
his
beast
;
and
as
he
was
not
an
unkind
-
hearted
man
,
and
every
case
was
more
pressing
and
more
distressful
than
the
last
;
 
as
much
as
he
loved
his
beast
,
he
had
never
a
heart
to
refuse
him
;
the
upshot
of
which
was
generally
this
;
that
his
horse
was
either
clapp'd
,
or
spavin'd
,
or
greaz'd
;
 
or
he
was
twitter
-
bon'd
,
or
broken
-
winded
,
or
something
,
in
short
,
or
other
had
befallen
him
,
which
would
let
him
carry
no
flesh
;
 
so
that
he
had
every
nine
or
ten
months
<EOS>
a
bad
horse
to
get
rid
of
,
 
and
a
good
horse
to
purchase
in
his
stead
.
  
<EOS>
What
the
loss
in
such
a
balance
might
amount
to
,
communibus
annis
,
I
would
leave
to
a
special
jury
of
sufferers
in
the
same
traffick
,
to
determine
;
  
but
let
it
be
what
it
would
,
the
honest
gentleman
bore
it
for
many
years
without
a
murmur
,
till
at
length
,
by
repeated
ill
accidents
of
the
kind
,
he
found
it
necessary
to
take
the
thing
under
consideration
;
and
upon
weighing
the
whole
,
and
summing
it
up
in
his
mind
,
he
found
it
not
only
disproportioned
to
his
other
expences
,
but
withal
so
heavy
an
article
in
itself
,
as
to
disable
him
from
any
other
act
of
generosity
in
his
parish
:
 
<EOS>
Besides
this
,
he
considered
that
with
half
the
sum
thus
galloped
away
,
he
could
do
ten
times
as
much
good
;
 
and
what
still
weighed
more
with
him
than
all
other
considerations
put
together
,
was
this
,
that
it
confined
all
his
charity
into
one
particular
channel
,
and
where
,
as
he
fancied
,
it
was
the
least
wanted
,
namely
,
to
the
child
-
bearing
and
child
-
getting
part
of
his
parish
;
reserving
nothing
for
the
impotent
,
 
nothing
for
the
aged
,
 
nothing
for
the
many
comfortless
scenes
he
was
hourly
called
forth
to
visit
,
where
poverty
,
and
sickness
and
affliction
dwelt
together
.
   
<EOS>
For
these
reasons
he
resolved
to
discontinue
the
expence
;
and
there
appeared
but
two
possible
ways
to
extricate
him
clearly
out
of
it
;
 
and
these
were
,
either
to
make
it
an
irrevocable
law
never
more
to
lend
his
steed
upon
any
application
<EOS>
whatever
,
 
or
else
be
content
to
ride
the
last
poor
devil
,
such
as
they
had
made
him
,
with
all
his
aches
and
infirmities
,
to
the
very
end
of
the
chapter
.
  
<EOS>
As
he
dreaded
his
own
constancy
in
the
first
 
he
very
chearfully
betook
himself
to
the
second
;
and
though
he
could
very
well
have
explained
it
,
as
I
said
,
to
his
honour
,
 
yet
,
for
that
very
reason
,
he
had
a
spirit
above
it
;
choosing
rather
to
bear
the
contempt
of
his
enemies
,
and
the
laughter
of
his
friends
,
than
undergo
the
pain
of
telling
a
story
,
which
might
seem
a
panegyrick
upon
himself
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
the
highest
idea
of
the
spiritual
and
refined
sentiments
of
this
reverend
gentleman
,
from
this
single
stroke
in
his
character
,
which
I
think
comes
up
to
any
of
the
honest
refinements
of
the
peerless
knight
of
La
Mancha
,
whom
,
by
the
bye
,
with
all
his
follies
,
I
love
more
,
and
would
actually
have
gone
farther
to
have
paid
a
visit
to
,
than
the
greatest
hero
of
antiquity
.
  
<EOS>
But
this
is
not
the
moral
of
my
story
:
 
<EOS>
The
thing
I
had
in
view
was
to
shew
the
temper
of
the
world
in
the
whole
of
this
affair
.
 
<EOS>
For
you
must
know
,
that
so
long
as
this
explanation
would
have
done
the
parson
credit
,
 
the
devil
a
soul
could
find
it
out
,
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
his
enemies
would
not
,
and
that
his
friends
could
not
.
 
<EOS>
But
no
sooner
did
he
bestir
himself
in
behalf
of
the
midwife
,
and
pay
the
expences
of
the
ordinary
's
licence
to
set
her
up
,
 
but
the
whole
secret
came
out
;
every
horse
he
had
lost
,
and
two
horses
more
than
ever
he
had
lost
,
with
all
the
circumstances
of
their
destruction
,
were
known
and
distinctly
remembered
.
 
<EOS>
The
story
ran
like
wild
-
fire

The
parson
had
a
returning
fit
of
pride
which
had
just
seized
him
;
and
he
was
going
to
be
well
mounted
once
again
in
his
life
;
and
if
it
was
so
,
'
twas
plain
as
the
sun
at
noon
-
day
,
he
would
pocket
the
expence
of
the
licence
ten
times
told
,
the
very
first
year
:
 
So
that
every
body
was
left
to
judge
what
were
his
views
in
this
act
of
charity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
What
were
his
views
in
this
,
and
in
every
other
action
of
his
life
,
 
or
rather
what
were
the
opinions
which
floated
in
the
brains
of
other
people
concerning
it
,
was
a
thought
which
too
much
floated
in
his
own
,
and
too
often
broke
in
upon
his
rest
,
when
he
should
have
been
sound
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
About
ten
years
ago
this
gentleman
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
made
entirely
easy
upon
that
score
,
 
<EOS>
it
being
just
so
long
since
he
left
his
parish
,
 
and
the
whole
world
at
the
same
time
behind
him
,
 
and
stands
accountable
to
a
Judge
of
whom
he
will
have
no
cause
to
complain
.
  
<EOS>
But
there
is
a
fatality
<EOS>
attends
the
actions
of
some
men
:
 
<EOS>
Order
them
as
they
will
,
they
pass
thro
'
a
certain
medium
,
which
so
twists
and
refracts
them
from
their
true
directions
 
that
,
with
all
the
titles
to
praise
which
a
rectitude
of
heart
can
give
,
the
doers
of
them
are
nevertheless
forced
to
live
and
die
without
it
.
  
<EOS>
Of
the
truth
of
which
,
this
gentleman
was
a
painful
example
.
 
<EOS>
But
to
know
by
what
means
this
came
to
pass
,
 
and
to
make
that
knowledge
of
use
to
you
,
I
insist
upon
it
that
you
read
the
two
following
chapters
,
which
contain
such
a
sketch
of
his
life
and
conversation
,
as
will
carry
its
moral
along
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
When
this
is
done
,
if
nothing
stops
us
in
our
way
,
we
will
go
on
with
the
midwife
.
    
<EOS>
Yorick
was
this
parson
's
name
,
and
,
what
is
very
remarkable
in
it
,
(
as
appears
from
a
most
ancient
account
of
the
family
,
wrote
upon
strong
vellum
,
and
now
in
perfect
preservation
)
<EOS>
it
had
been
exactly
so
spelt
for
near
,
 
<EOS>
I
was
within
an
ace
of
saying
nine
hundred
years
;
 
but
<EOS>
I
would
not
shake
my
credit
in
telling
an
improbable
truth
,
however
indisputable
in
itself
,
 
and
therefore
I
shall
content
myself
with
only
saying
 
<EOS>
It
had
been
exactly
so
spelt
,
without
the
least
variation
or
transposition
of
a
single
letter
,
for
I
do
not
know
how
long
;
which
is
more
than
I
would
venture
to
say
of
one
half
of
the
best
surnames
in
the
kingdom
;
which
,
in
a
course
of
years
,
have
generally
undergone
as
many
chops
and
changes
as
their
owners
.
 
<EOS>
Has
this
been
owing
to
the
pride
,
or
to
the
shame
of
the
respective
proprietors
?
 
<EOS>
In
honest
truth
,
I
think
sometimes
to
the
one
,
and
sometimes
to
the
other
,
just
as
the
temptation
has
wrought
.
 
<EOS>
But
a
villainous
affair
it
is
,
and
will
one
day
so
blend
and
confound
us
all
together
,
that
no
one
shall
be
able
to
stand
up
and
swear
,
"
That
his
own
great
grandfather
was
the
man
who
did
either
this
or
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
evil
had
been
sufficiently
fenced
against
by
the
prudent
care
of
the
Yorick
's
family
,
and
their
religious
preservation
of
these
records
I
quote
,
which
do
farther
inform
us
,
That
the
family
was
originally
of
Danish
extraction
,
and
had
been
transplanted
into
England
as
early
as
in
the
reign
of
Horwendillus
,
king
of
Denmark
,
in
whose
court
,
it
seems
,
an
ancestor
of
this
Mr.
Yorick
's
,
and
from
whom
he
was
lineally
descended
,
held
a
considerable
post
to
the
day
of
his
death
.
 
<EOS>
Of
what
nature
this
considerable
post
was
,
<EOS>
this
record
saith
not
;
 
<EOS>
it
only
adds
,
That
,
for
near
two
centuries
,
it
had
been
totally
abolished
,
as
altogether
unnecessary
,
not
only
in
that
court
,
but
in
every
other
court
of
the
Christian
world
.
  
<EOS>
It
has
often
come
into
my
head
,
that
this
post
could
be
no
other
than
that
of
the
king
's
chief
Jester
;
 
and
that
Hamlet
's
Yorick
,
in
our
Shakespeare
,
many
of
whose
plays
,
you
know
,
are
founded
upon
authenticated
facts
,
was
certainly
the
very
man
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
time
to
look
into
Saxo
-
Grammaticus
's
Danish
history
,
to
know
the
certainty
of
this
;
 
but
if
you
have
leisure
,
and
can
easily
get
at
the
book
,
you
may
do
it
full
as
well
yourself
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
just
time
,
in
my
travels
through
Denmark
with
Mr.
Noddy
's
eldest
son
,
whom
,
in
the
year
1741
,
I
accompanied
as
governor
,
riding
along
with
him
at
a
prodigious
rate
thro
'
most
parts
of
Europe
,
and
of
which
original
journey
performed
by
us
two
,
a
most
delectable
narrative
will
be
given
in
the
progress
of
this
work
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
just
time
,
I
say
,
and
that
was
all
,
to
prove
the
truth
of
an
observation
made
by
a
long
sojourner
in
that
country
;
  
namely
,
"
<EOS>
That
nature
was
neither
very
lavish
,
nor
was
she
very
stingy
in
her
gifts
of
genius
and
capacity
to
its
inhabitants
;
 
but
,
like
a
discreet
parent
,
was
moderately
kind
to
them
all
;
observing
such
an
equal
tenor
in
the
distribution
of
her
favours
,
as
to
bring
them
,
in
those
points
,
pretty
near
to
a
level
with
each
other
;
so
that
you
will
meet
with
few
instances
in
that
kingdom
of
refined
parts
;
but
a
great
deal
of
good
plain
houshold
understanding
amongst
all
ranks
of
people
,
of
which
every
body
has
a
share
;
"
which
is
,
I
think
,
very
right
.
  
<EOS>
With
us
,
you
see
,
the
case
is
quite
different
:
 
<EOS>
we
are
all
ups
and
downs
in
this
matter
;
 
you
are
a
great
genius
;
 
or
'
tis
fifty
to
one
,
Sir
,
you
are
a
great
dunce
and
a
blockhead
;
 
not
that
there
is
a
total
want
of
intermediate
steps
,
 
no
,
 
<EOS>
we
are
not
so
irregular
as
that
comes
to
;
 
but
the
two
extremes
are
more
common
,
and
in
a
greater
degree
in
this
unsettled
island
,
where
nature
,
in
her
gifts
and
dispositions
of
this
kind
,
is
most
whimsical
and
capricious
;
fortune
herself
not
being
more
so
in
the
bequest
of
her
goods
and
chattels
than
she
.
  
<EOS>
This
is
all
that
ever
staggered
my
faith
in
regard
to
Yorick
's
extraction
,
who
,
by
what
I
can
remember
of
him
,
and
by
all
the
accounts
I
could
ever
get
of
him
,
seemed
not
to
have
had
one
single
drop
of
Danish
blood
in
his
whole
crasis
;
in
nine
hundred
years
,
it
might
possibly
have
all
run
out
:
 
I
will
not
philosophize
one
moment
with
you
about
it
;
for
happen
how
it
would
,
the
fact
was
this
:
 
That
instead
of
that
cold
phlegm
and
exact
regularity
of
sense
and
humours
,
you
would
have
looked
for
,
in
one
so
extracted
;
 
he
was
,
on
the
contrary
,
as
mercurial
and
sublimated
a
composition
,
 
as
heteroclite
a
creature
in
all
his
declensions
;
 
with
as
much
life
and
whim
,
and
gaite
de
coeur
about
him
,
as
the
kindliest
climate
could
have
engendered
and
put
together
.
 
<EOS>
With
all
this
sail
,
poor
Yorick
carried
not
one
ounce
of
ballast
;
he
was
utterly
unpractised
in
the
world
;
and
at
the
age
of
twenty
-
six
,
knew
just
about
as
well
how
to
steer
his
course
in
it
,
as
a
romping
,
unsuspicious
girl
of
thirteen
:
 
<EOS>
So
that
upon
his
first
setting
out
,
the
brisk
gale
of
his
spirits
,
as
you
will
imagine
,
ran
him
foul
ten
times
in
a
day
of
somebody
's
tackling
;
and
as
the
grave
and
more
slow
-
paced
were
oftenest
in
his
way
,
 
you
may
likewise
imagine
,
'
twas
with
such
<EOS>
he
had
generally
the
ill
luck
to
get
the
most
entangled
.
 
<EOS>
For
aught
I
know
there
might
be
some
mixture
of
unlucky
wit
at
the
bottom
of
such
Fracas
:
 
<EOS>
For
,
to
speak
the
truth
,
Yorick
had
an
invincible
dislike
and
opposition
in
his
nature
to
gravity
;
 
not
to
gravity
as
such
;
 
for
where
gravity
was
wanted
,
he
would
be
the
most
grave
or
serious
of
mortal
men
for
days
and
weeks
together
;
 
but
he
was
an
enemy
to
the
affectation
of
it
,
and
declared
open
war
against
it
,
only
as
it
appeared
a
cloak
for
ignorance
,
or
for
folly
:
 
and
then
,
whenever
it
fell
in
his
way
,
however
sheltered
and
protected
,
he
seldom
gave
it
much
quarter
.
  
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
in
his
wild
way
of
talking
,
he
would
say
,
that
Gravity
was
an
errant
scoundrel
,
and
he
would
add
,
 
of
the
most
dangerous
kind
too
,
  
because
a
sly
one
;
and
that
he
verily
believed
,
more
honest
,
well
-
meaning
people
were
bubbled
out
of
their
goods
and
money
by
it
in
one
twelve
-
month
,
than
by
pocket
-
picking
and
shop
-
lifting
in
seven
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
naked
temper
which
a
merry
heart
discovered
,
he
would
say
there
was
no
danger
,
 
but
to
itself
:
 
whereas
the
very
essence
of
gravity
was
design
,
and
consequently
deceit
;
 
'
twas
a
taught
trick
to
gain
credit
of
the
world
for
more
sense
and
knowledge
than
a
man
was
worth
;
and
that
,
with
all
its
pretensions
,
 
it
was
no
better
,
but
often
worse
,
than
what
a
French
wit
had
long
ago
defined
it
,
 
viz
.
"
<EOS>
A
mysterious
carriage
of
the
body
to
cover
the
defects
of
the
mind
;
"
 
which
definition
of
gravity
,
Yorick
,
with
great
imprudence
,
would
say
,
deserved
to
be
wrote
in
letters
of
gold
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
in
plain
truth
,
he
was
a
man
unhackneyed
and
unpractised
in
the
world
,
and
was
altogether
as
indiscreet
and
foolish
on
every
other
subject
of
discourse
where
policy
is
wo
nt
to
impress
restraint
.
 
<EOS>
Yorick
had
no
impression
but
one
,
and
that
was
what
arose
from
the
nature
of
the
deed
spoken
of
;
which
impression
he
would
usually
translate
into
plain
English
without
any
periphrasis
;
 
and
too
oft
without
much
distinction
of
either
person
,
time
,
or
place
;
 
so
that
when
mention
was
made
of
a
pitiful
or
an
ungenerous
proceeding
 
<EOS>
he
never
gave
himself
a
moment
's
time
to
reflect
who
was
the
hero
of
the
piece
,
 
what
his
station
,
 
or
how
far
he
had
power
to
hurt
him
hereafter
;
 
but
if
it
was
a
dirty
action
,
 
without
more
ado
,
 
The
man
was
a
dirty
fellow
,
 
and
so
on
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
his
comments
had
usually
the
ill
fate
to
be
terminated
either
in
a
bon
mot
,
or
to
be
enlivened
throughout
with
some
drollery
or
humour
of
expression
,
it
gave
wings
to
Yorick
's
indiscretion
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
tho
'
he
never
sought
,
yet
,
at
the
same
time
,
as
he
seldom
shunned
occasions
of
saying
what
came
uppermost
,
and
without
much
ceremony
;
 
he
had
but
too
many
temptations
in
life
,
of
scattering
his
wit
and
his
humour
,
 
his
gibes
and
his
jests
about
him
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
not
lost
for
want
of
gathering
.
  
<EOS>
What
were
the
consequences
,
and
what
was
Yorick
's
catastrophe
<EOS>
thereupon
,
you
will
read
in
the
next
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
The
Mortgager
and
Mortgagee
differ
the
one
from
the
other
,
not
more
in
length
of
purse
,
than
the
Jester
and
Jestee
do
,
in
that
of
memory
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
this
the
comparison
between
them
runs
,
as
the
scholiasts
call
it
,
upon
all-
four
;
which
,
by
the
bye
,
is
upon
one
or
two
legs
more
than
some
of
the
best
of
Homer
's
can
pretend
to
;
 
namely
,
That
the
one
raises
a
sum
,
and
the
other
a
laugh
at
your
expence
,
and
thinks
no
more
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
Interest
,
however
,
still
runs
on
in
both
cases
;
 
the
periodical
or
accidental
payments
of
it
,
just
serving
to
keep
the
memory
of
the
affair
alive
;
till
,
at
length
,
in
some
evil
hour
,
pop
comes
the
creditor
upon
each
,
and
by
demanding
principal
upon
the
spot
,
together
with
full
interest
to
the
very
day
,
makes
them
both
feel
the
full
extent
of
their
obligations
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
reader
(
for
I
hate
your
ifs
)
has
a
thorough
knowledge
of
human
nature
,
I
need
not
say
more
to
satisfy
him
,
that
my
Hero
could
not
go
on
at
this
rate
without
some
slight
experience
of
these
incidental
mementos
.
 
<EOS>
To
speak
the
truth
,
he
had
wantonly
involved
himself
in
a
multitude
of
small
book
-
debts
of
this
stamp
,
which
,
notwithstanding
Eugenius
's
frequent
advice
,
he
too
much
disregarded
;
thinking
,
that
as
not
one
of
them
was
contracted
thro
'
any
malignancy
;
 
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
from
an
honesty
of
mind
,
and
a
mere
jocundity
of
humour
,
they
would
all
of
them
be
cross'd
out
in
course
.
  
<EOS>
Eugenius
would
never
admit
this
;
and
would
often
tell
him
,
that
one
day
or
other
he
would
certainly
be
reckoned
with
;
and
he
would
often
add
,
in
an
accent
of
sorrowful
apprehension
,
 
to
the
uttermost
mite
.
 
<EOS>
To
which
Yorick
,
with
his
usual
carelessness
of
heart
,
would
as
often
answer
with
a
pshaw
!
  
<EOS>
and
if
the
subject
was
started
in
the
fields
,
 
with
a
hop
,
skip
,
and
a
jump
at
the
end
of
it
;
but
if
close
pent
up
in
the
social
chimney
-
corner
,
where
the
culprit
was
barricado'd
<EOS>
in
,
with
a
table
and
a
couple
of
arm
-
chairs
,
and
could
not
so
readily
fly
off
in
a
tangent
,
 
Eugenius
would
then
go
on
with
his
lecture
upon
discretion
in
words
to
this
purpose
,
though
somewhat
better
put
together
.
  
<EOS>
Trust
me
,
dear
Yorick
,
this
unwary
pleasantry
of
thine
will
sooner
or
later
bring
thee
into
scrapes
and
difficulties
,
which
no
after
-
wit
can
extricate
thee
out
of
.
 
<EOS>
In
these
sallies
,
too
oft
,
I
see
,
it
happens
,
that
a
person
laughed
at
,
considers
himself
in
the
light
of
a
person
injured
,
with
all
the
rights
of
such
a
situation
belonging
to
him
;
and
when
thou
viewest
him
in
that
light
too
,
and
reckons
up
his
friends
,
his
family
,
his
kindred
and
allies
,
 
and
musters
up
with
them
the
many
recruits
which
will
list
under
him
from
a
sense
of
common
danger
;
 
'
tis
no
extravagant
arithmetic
to
say
,
that
for
every
ten
jokes
,
 
thou
hast
got
an
hundred
enemies
;
and
till
thou
hast
gone
on
,
and
raised
a
swarm
of
wasps
about
thine
ears
,
and
art
half
stung
to
death
by
them
,
thou
wilt
never
be
convinced
it
is
so
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
suspect
it
in
the
man
whom
I
esteem
,
that
there
is
the
least
spur
from
spleen
or
malevolence
of
intent
in
these
sallies
 
<EOS>
I
believe
and
know
them
to
be
truly
honest
and
sportive
:
 
But
consider
,
my
dear
lad
,
that
fools
can
not
distinguish
this
,
 
and
that
knaves
will
not
:
 
and
thou
knowest
<EOS>
not
what
it
is
,
either
to
provoke
the
one
,
or
to
make
merry
with
the
other
:
 
<EOS>
whenever
they
associate
for
mutual
defence
,
depend
upon
it
,
they
will
carry
on
the
war
in
such
a
manner
against
thee
,
my
dear
friend
,
as
to
make
thee
heartily
sick
of
it
,
and
of
thy
life
too
.
  
<EOS>
Revenge
from
some
baneful
corner
shall
level
a
tale
of
dishonour
at
thee
,
which
no
innocence
of
heart
or
integrity
of
conduct
shall
set
right
.
 
<EOS>
The
fortunes
of
thy
house
shall
totter
,
 
thy
character
,
which
led
the
way
to
them
,
shall
bleed
on
every
side
of
it
,
 
thy
faith
questioned
,
 
thy
works
belied
,
 
thy
wit
forgotten
,
 
<EOS>
thy
learning
trampled
on
.
 
<EOS>
To
wind
up
the
last
scene
of
thy
tragedy
,
Cruelty
and
Cowardice
,
twin
ruffians
,
hired
and
set
on
by
Malice
in
the
dark
,
shall
strike
together
at
all
thy
infirmities
and
mistakes
:
 
<EOS>
The
best
of
us
,
my
dear
lad
,
lie
open
there
,
 
and
trust
me
,
  
trust
me
,
Yorick
,
when
to
gratify
a
private
appetite
,
it
is
once
resolved
upon
,
that
an
innocent
and
an
helpless
creature
shall
be
sacrificed
,
'
tis
an
easy
matter
to
pick
up
sticks
enough
from
any
thicket
where
it
has
strayed
,
to
make
a
fire
to
offer
it
up
with
.
  
<EOS>
Yorick
scarce
ever
heard
this
sad
vaticination
of
his
destiny
read
over
to
him
,
but
with
a
tear
stealing
from
his
eye
,
and
a
promissory
look
attending
it
,
that
he
was
resolved
,
for
the
time
to
come
,
to
ride
his
tit
with
more
sobriety
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
alas
,
too
late
!
 
<EOS>
a
grand
confederacy
with
.
.
<EOS>
.and
.
.
<EOS>
.at
<EOS>
the
head
of
it
,
was
formed
before
the
first
prediction
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
plan
of
the
attack
,
just
as
Eugenius
had
foreboded
,
was
put
in
execution
all
at
once
,
 
with
so
little
mercy
on
the
side
of
the
allies
,
 
and
so
little
suspicion
in
Yorick
,
of
what
was
carrying
on
against
him
,
 
<EOS>
that
when
he
thought
,
<EOS>
good
easy
man
!
<EOS>
full
surely
preferment
was
o'ripening
,
 
they
had
smote
his
root
,
and
then
he
fell
,
as
many
a
worthy
man
had
fallen
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
Yorick
,
however
,
fought
it
out
with
all
imaginable
gallantry
for
some
time
;
till
,
overpowered
by
numbers
,
and
worn
out
at
length
by
the
calamities
of
the
war
,
 
but
more
so
,
by
the
ungenerous
manner
in
which
it
was
carried
on
,
 
he
threw
down
the
sword
;
and
though
he
kept
up
his
spirits
in
appearance
to
the
last
,
he
died
,
nevertheless
,
as
was
generally
thought
,
quite
broken
-
hearted
.
  
<EOS>
What
inclined
Eugenius
to
the
same
opinion
was
as
follows
:
  
<EOS>
A
few
hours
before
Yorick
breathed
his
last
,
Eugenius
stept
in
with
an
intent
to
take
his
last
sight
and
last
farewell
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
his
drawing
Yorick
's
curtain
,
and
asking
how
he
felt
himself
,
Yorick
looking
up
in
his
face
took
hold
of
his
hand
,
 
and
after
thanking
him
for
the
many
tokens
of
his
friendship
to
him
,
for
which
,
he
said
,
if
it
was
their
fate
to
meet
hereafter
,
 
he
would
thank
him
again
and
again
,
 
he
told
him
,
he
was
within
a
few
hours
of
giving
his
enemies
the
slip
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
not
,
answered
Eugenius
,
with
tears
trickling
down
his
cheeks
,
and
with
the
tenderest
tone
that
ever
man
spoke
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
not
,
Yorick
,
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
Yorick
replied
,
with
a
look
up
,
and
a
gentle
squeeze
of
Eugenius
's
hand
,
and
that
was
all
,
 
<EOS>
but
it
cut
Eugenius
to
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
 
come
,
<EOS>
Yorick
,
quoth
Eugenius
,
wiping
his
eyes
,
and
summoning
up
the
man
within
him
,
 
my
dear
lad
,
be
comforted
,
 
let
not
all
thy
spirits
and
fortitude
forsake
thee
at
this
crisis
when
thou
most
wants
them
;
 
who
knows
what
resources
are
in
store
,
and
what
the
power
of
God
may
yet
do
for
thee
!
 
<EOS>
Yorick
laid
his
hand
upon
his
heart
,
and
gently
shook
his
head
;
 
For
my
part
,
continued
Eugenius
,
crying
bitterly
as
he
uttered
the
words
,
 
<EOS>
I
declare
I
know
not
,
Yorick
,
how
to
part
with
thee
,
and
would
gladly
flatter
my
hopes
,
added
Eugenius
,
chearing
up
his
voice
,
that
there
is
still
enough
left
of
thee
to
make
a
bishop
,
and
that
I
may
live
to
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
beseech
thee
,
Eugenius
,
quoth
Yorick
,
taking
off
his
night
-
cap
as
well
as
he
could
with
his
left
hand
,
 
his
right
being
still
grasped
close
in
that
of
Eugenius
,
 
I
beseech
thee
to
take
a
view
of
my
head
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
nothing
that
ails
it
,
replied
Eugenius
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
alas
!
<EOS>
my
friend
,
said
Yorick
,
let
me
tell
you
,
that
'
tis
so
bruised
and
mis
-
shapened
with
the
blows
<EOS>
which
.
.
<EOS>
.and
.
.
.
,
and
some
others
have
so
unhandsomely
given
me
in
the
dark
,
that
I
might
say
with
Sancho
Panca
,
that
should
I
recover
,
and
"
Mitres
thereupon
be
suffered
to
rain
down
from
heaven
as
thick
as
hail
,
not
one
of
them
would
fit
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
Yorick
's
last
breath
was
hanging
upon
his
trembling
lips
ready
to
depart
as
he
uttered
this
:
 
yet
still
it
was
uttered
with
something
of
a
Cervantick
tone
;
 
and
as
he
spoke
it
,
Eugenius
could
perceive
a
stream
of
lambent
fire
lighted
up
for
a
moment
in
his
eyes
;
 
faint
picture
of
those
flashes
of
his
spirit
,
which
(
as
Shakespeare
said
of
his
ancestor
)
were
wo
nt
to
set
the
table
in
a
roar
!
  
<EOS>
Eugenius
was
convinced
from
this
,
that
the
heart
of
his
friend
was
broke
:
 
<EOS>
he
squeezed
his
hand
,
 
and
then
walked
softly
out
of
the
room
,
weeping
as
he
walked
.
 
<EOS>
Yorick
followed
Eugenius
with
his
eyes
to
the
door
,
 
he
then
closed
them
,
and
never
opened
them
more
.
  
<EOS>
He
lies
buried
in
the
corner
of
his
church
-
yard
,
in
the
parish
of
.
.
.
<EOS>
,
under
a
plain
marble
slab
,
which
his
friend
Eugenius
,
by
leave
of
his
executors
,
laid
upon
his
grave
,
with
no
more
than
these
three
words
of
inscription
,
serving
both
for
his
epitaph
and
elegy
.
 
<EOS>
Alas
,
poor
Yorick
!
  
<EOS>
Ten
times
a
day
has
Yorick
's
ghost
the
consolation
to
hear
his
monumental
inscription
read
over
with
such
a
variety
of
plaintive
tones
,
as
denote
a
general
pity
and
esteem
for
him
;
 
a
foot
-
way
crossing
the
church
-
yard
close
by
the
side
of
his
grave
,
 
not
a
passenger
goes
by
without
stopping
to
cast
a
look
upon
it
,
 
and
sighing
as
he
walks
on
,
Alas
,
poor
Yorick
!
    
<EOS>
It
is
so
long
since
the
reader
of
this
rhapsodical
work
has
been
parted
from
the
midwife
,
that
it
is
high
time
to
mention
her
again
to
him
,
merely
to
put
him
in
mind
that
there
is
such
a
body
still
in
the
world
,
and
whom
,
upon
the
best
judgment
I
can
form
upon
my
own
plan
at
present
,
I
am
going
to
introduce
to
him
for
good
and
all
:
 
<EOS>
But
as
fresh
matter
may
be
started
,
and
much
unexpected
business
fall
out
betwixt
the
reader
and
myself
,
which
may
require
immediate
dispatch
;
 
'
twas
right
to
take
care
that
the
poor
woman
should
not
be
lost
in
the
mean
time
;
 
because
when
she
is
wanted
,
we
can
no
way
do
without
her
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
I
told
you
that
this
good
woman
was
a
person
of
no
small
note
and
consequence
throughout
our
whole
village
and
township
;
 
that
her
fame
had
spread
itself
to
the
very
out
-
edge
and
circumference
of
that
circle
of
importance
,
of
which
kind
every
soul
living
,
whether
he
has
a
shirt
to
his
back
or
no
<EOS>
,
 
has
one
surrounding
him
;
 
which
said
circle
,
by
the
way
,
whenever
'
tis
said
that
such
a
one
is
of
great
weight
and
importance
in
the
world
,
 
I
desire
may
be
enlarged
or
contracted
in
your
worship
's
fancy
,
in
a
compound
ratio
of
the
station
,
profession
,
knowledge
,
abilities
,
height
and
depth
(
measuring
both
ways
)
of
the
personage
brought
before
you
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
present
case
,
if
I
remember
,
I
fixed
it
about
four
or
five
miles
,
which
not
only
comprehended
the
whole
parish
,
but
extended
itself
to
two
or
three
of
the
adjacent
hamlets
in
the
skirts
of
the
next
parish
;
which
made
a
considerable
thing
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
add
,
<EOS>
That
she
was
,
moreover
,
very
well
looked
on
at
one
large
grange
-
house
,
and
some
other
odd
houses
and
farms
within
two
or
three
miles
,
as
I
said
,
from
the
smoke
of
her
own
chimney
:
  
<EOS>
But
I
must
here
,
once
for
all
,
inform
you
,
that
all
this
will
be
more
exactly
delineated
and
explain'd
in
a
map
,
now
in
the
hands
of
the
engraver
,
which
,
with
many
other
pieces
and
developements
of
this
work
,
will
be
added
to
the
end
of
the
twentieth
volume
,
 
not
to
swell
the
work
,
  
<EOS>
I
detest
the
thought
of
such
a
thing
;
 
but
by
way
of
commentary
,
scholium
,
illustration
,
and
key
to
such
passages
,
incidents
,
or
inuendos
as
shall
be
thought
to
be
either
of
private
interpretation
,
or
of
dark
or
doubtful
meaning
,
after
my
life
and
my
opinions
shall
have
been
read
over
(
now
do
n't
 
forget
the
meaning
of
the
word
)
by
all
the
world
;
 
which
,
betwixt
you
and
me
,
and
in
spite
of
all
the
gentlemen
-
reviewers
in
Great
Britain
,
and
of
all
that
their
worships
shall
undertake
to
write
or
say
to
the
contrary
,
 
I
am
determined
shall
be
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
I
need
not
tell
your
worship
,
that
all
this
is
spoke
in
confidence
.
    
<EOS>
Upon
looking
into
my
mother
's
marriage
settlement
,
in
order
to
satisfy
myself
and
reader
in
a
point
necessary
to
be
cleared
up
,
before
we
could
proceed
any
farther
in
this
history
;
 
I
had
the
good
fortune
to
pop
upon
the
very
thing
I
wanted
before
I
had
read
a
day
and
a
half
straight
forwards
,
 
it
might
have
taken
me
up
a
month
;
 
which
shews
plainly
,
that
when
a
man
sits
down
to
write
a
history
,
 
tho
'
it
be
but
the
history
of
Jack
Hickathrift
or
Tom
Thumb
<EOS>
,
he
knows
no
more
than
his
heels
<EOS>
what
lets
and
confounded
hindrances
he
is
to
meet
with
in
his
way
,
 
or
what
a
dance
<EOS>
he
may
be
led
,
by
one
excursion
or
another
,
before
all
is
over
.
 
<EOS>
Could
a
historiographer
drive
on
his
history
,
as
a
muleteer
drives
on
his
mule
,
  
straight
forward
;
 
for
instance
,
from
Rome
all
the
way
to
Loretto
,
without
ever
once
turning
his
head
aside
,
either
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
,
 
he
might
venture
to
foretell
you
to
an
hour
when
he
should
get
to
his
journey
's
end
;
 
but
the
thing
is
,
morally
speaking
,
impossible
:
 
For
,
if
he
is
a
man
of
the
least
spirit
,
he
will
have
fifty
deviations
from
a
straight
line
to
make
with
this
or
that
party
as
he
goes
along
,
which
he
can
no
ways
avoid
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
have
views
and
prospects
to
himself
perpetually
soliciting
his
eye
,
which
he
can
no
more
help
standing
still
to
look
at
than
he
can
fly
;
he
will
moreover
have
various
 
Accounts
to
reconcile
:
  
<EOS>
Anecdotes
to
pick
up
:
  
<EOS>
Inscriptions
to
make
out
:
  
Stories
to
weave
in
:
  
Traditions
to
sift
:
  
<EOS>
Personages
to
call
upon
:
  
Panegyricks
to
paste
up
at
this
door
;
  
Pasquinades
at
that
:
 
All
which
both
the
man
and
his
mule
are
quite
exempt
from
.
 
<EOS>
To
sum
up
all
;
there
are
archives
at
every
stage
to
be
look'd
into
,
and
rolls
,
records
,
documents
,
and
endless
genealogies
,
which
justice
ever
and
anon
calls
him
back
to
stay
the
reading
of
:
 
<EOS>
In
short
there
is
no
end
of
it
;
 
for
my
own
part
<EOS>
,
I
declare
I
have
been
at
it
these
six
weeks
,
making
all
the
speed
I
possibly
could
,
 
and
am
not
yet
born
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
just
been
able
,
and
that
's
all
,
to
tell
you
when
it

These
unforeseen
stoppages

which
I
own
I
had
no
conception
of
when
I
first
set
out

which
<EOS>
,
I
am
convinced
now
,
will
rather
increase
than
diminish
as
I
advance
,
 
have
struck
out
a
hint
which
I
am
resolved
to
follow
;
 
and
that
is
,
 
not
to
be
in
a
hurry
;
 
but
to
go
on
leisurely
,
writing
and
publishing
two
volumes
of
my
life
every
year
;
 
which
,
if
I
am
suffered
to
go
on
quietly
,
and
can
make
a
tolerable
bargain
with
my
bookseller
,
I
shall
continue
to
do
as
long
as
I
live

<EOS>
In
three
words
,
 
"
My
mother
was
to
lay
in
(
if
she
chose
it
)
in
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
in
order
to
put
a
stop
to
the
practice
of
any
unfair
play
on
the
part
of
my
mother
,
which
a
marriage
-
article
of
this
nature
too
manifestly
opened
a
door
to
,
and
which
indeed
had
never
been
thought
of
at
all
,
but
for
my
uncle
Toby
Shandy
;
 
a
clause
was
added
in
security
of
my
father
which
was
this
:
 
"
That
in
case
my
mother
hereafter
should
,
at
any
time
,
put
my
father
to
the
trouble
and
expence
of
a
London
journey
,
upon
false
cries
and
tokens
;
 
that
for
every
such
instance
,
she
should
forfeit
<EOS>
all
the
right
and
title
which
the
covenant
gave
her
to
the
next
turn
;
 
but
to
no
more
,
 
and
so
on
<EOS>
,
toties
quoties
,
in
as
effectual
a
manner
,
as
if
such
a
covenant
betwixt
<EOS>
them
had
not
been
made
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
This
,
by
the
way
,
was
no
more
than
what
was
reasonable
;
 
and
yet
,
as
reasonable
as
it
was
,
I
have
ever
thought
it
hard
that
the
whole
weight
of
the
article
should
have
fallen
entirely
,
as
it
did
,
upon
myself
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
was
begot
and
born
to
misfortunes
;
 
for
my
poor
mother
,
whether
it
was
wind
or
water
 
or
a
compound
of
both
,
 
or
neither
;
 
or
whether
it
was
simply
the
mere
swell
of
imagination
and
fancy
in
her
;
 
or
how
far
a
strong
wish
and
desire
to
have
it
so
,
might
mislead
her
judgment
;
 
in
short
,
whether
she
was
deceived
or
deceiving
in
this
matter
<EOS>
,
it
no
way
becomes
me
to
decide
.
 
<EOS>
The
fact
was
this
,
That
in
the
latter
end
of
September
1717
,
which
was
the
year
before
I
was
born
,
my
mother
having
carried
my
father
up
to
town
much
against
the
grain
,
 
he
peremptorily
insisted
upon
the
clause
;
 
so
that
I
was
doom'd
,
by
marriage
-
articles
,
to
have
my
nose
squeez'd
<EOS>
as
flat
to
my
face
,
as
if
the
destinies
had
actually
spun
me
without
one
.
  
<EOS>
How
this
event
came
about
,
 
and
what
a
train
of
vexatious
disappointments
,
in
one
stage
or
other
of
my
life
,
have
pursued
me
from
the
mere
loss
,
or
rather
compression
,
of
this
one
single
member
,
 
shall
be
laid
before
the
reader
all
in
due
time
.
     
<EOS>
My
father
,
as
any
body
may
naturally
imagine
,
came
down
with
my
mother
into
the
country
,
in
but
a
pettish
kind
of
a
humour
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
twenty
or
five-
and
-
twenty
miles
he
did
nothing
in
the
world
but
fret
and
teaze
himself
,
and
indeed
my
mother
too
,
about
the
cursed
expence
,
which
he
said
might
every
shilling
of
it
have
been
saved
;
 
then
what
vexed
him
more
than
<EOS>
every
thing
else
was
,
the
provoking
time
of
the
year
,
 
which
,
as
I
told
you
,
was
towards
the
end
of
September
,
when
his
wall
-
fruit
and
green
gages
especially
,
in
which
he
was
very
curious
,
were
just
ready
for
pulling
:
  
"
<EOS>
Had
he
been
whistled
up
to
London
,
upon
a
Tom
Fool
's
errand
,
<EOS>
in
any
other
month
of
the
whole
year
,
he
should
not
have
said
three
words
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
For
the
next
two
whole
stages
,
no
subject
would
go
down
,
but
the
heavy
blow
he
had
sustain'd
from
the
loss
of
a
son
,
whom
it
seems
he
had
fully
reckon'd
upon
in
his
mind
,
and
register'd
down
in
his
pocket
-
book
,
as
a
second
staff
for
his
old
age
,
in
case
Bobby
should
fail
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
disappointment
of
this
,
he
said
,
was
ten
times
more
to
a
wise
man
,
than
all
the
money
which
the
journey
,
&
c.
had
cost
him
,
put
together
,
 
rot
the
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
,
 
<EOS>
he
did
not
mind
it
a
rush
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
From
Stilton
,
all
the
way
to
Grantham
,
nothing
in
the
whole
affair
provoked
him
so
much
as
the
condolences
of
his
friends
,
and
the
foolish
figure
they
should
both
make
at
church
,
the
first
Sunday
;
 
of
which
,
in
the
satirical
vehemence
of
his
wit
,
now
sharpen'd
a
little
by
vexation
,
he
would
give
so
many
humorous
and
provoking
descriptions
,
 
and
place
his
rib
and
self
in
so
many
tormenting
lights
and
attitudes
in
the
face
of
the
whole
congregation
;
 
that
my
mother
declared
,
these
two
stages
were
so
truly
tragi
-
comical
,
that
she
did
nothing
but
laugh
and
cry
in
a
breath
,
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
them
all
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
From
Grantham
,
till
they
had
cross'd
<EOS>
the
Trent
,
my
father
was
out
of
all
kind
of
patience
at
the
vile
trick
and
imposition
which
he
fancied
my
mother
had
put
upon
him
in
this
affair
 
"
Certainly
,
"
he
would
say
to
himself
,
over
and
over
again
,
"
the
woman
could
not
be
deceived
herself
 
if
she
could
,
 
what
weakness
!
"
 
<EOS>
tormenting
word
!
 
<EOS>
which
led
his
imagination
a
thorny
dance
,
and
,
before
all
was
over
,
play'd
<EOS>
the
duce
and
all
with
him
;
  
for
sure
as
ever
<EOS>
the
word
weakness
was
uttered
,
and
struck
full
upon
his
brain
 
so
sure
it
set
him
upon
running
divisions
upon
how
many
kinds
of
weaknesses
there
were
;
 
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
weakness
of
the
body
,
 
as
well
as
weakness
of
the
mind
,
 
and
then
he
would
do
nothing
but
syllogize
within
himself
for
a
stage
or
two
together
,
<EOS>
How
far
the
cause
of
all
these
vexations
might
,
or
might
not
,
have
arisen
out
of
himself
.
  
<EOS>
In
short
,
he
had
so
many
little
subjects
of
disquietude
springing
out
of
this
one
affair
,
all
fretting
successively
in
his
mind
as
they
rose
up
in
it
,
that
my
mother
,
whatever
was
her
journey
up
,
had
but
an
uneasy
journey
of
it
down
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
as
she
complained
to
my
uncle
Toby
,
he
would
have
tired
out
the
patience
of
any
flesh
alive
.
     
<EOS>
Though
my
father
travelled
homewards
,
as
I
told
you
,
in
none
of
the
best
of
moods
,
 
pshawing
and
pishing
all
the
way
down
,
 
yet
he
had
the
complaisance
to
keep
the
worst
part
of
the
story
still
to
himself
;
 
which
was
the
resolution
he
had
taken
of
doing
himself
the
justice
,
which
my
uncle
Toby
's
clause
in
the
marriage
-
settlement
empowered
him
;
nor
was
it
till
the
very
night
in
which
I
was
begot
,
which
was
thirteen
months
after
,
that
she
had
the
least
intimation
of
his
design
:
 
when
my
father
,
happening
,
as
you
remember
,
to
be
a
little
chagrin'd
and
out
of
temper
<EOS>
,
 
took
occasion
as
they
lay
chatting
gravely
in
bed
afterwards
,
talking
over
what
was
to
come
,
 
to
let
her
know
that
she
must
accommodate
herself
as
well
as
she
could
to
the
bargain
made
between
them
in
their
marriage
-
deeds
;
<EOS>
which
was
to
lye
-
in
of
her
next
child
in
the
country
,
to
balance
the
last
year
's
journey
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
was
a
gentleman
of
many
virtues
,
 
<EOS>
but
he
had
a
strong
spice
of
that
in
his
temper
,
which
might
,
or
might
not
,
add
to
the
number
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
known
by
the
name
of
perseverance
in
a
good
cause
,
 
and
of
obstinacy
in
a
bad
one
:
 
Of
this
my
mother
had
so
much
knowledge
,
that
she
knew
'
twas
to
no
purpose
to
make
any
remonstrance
,
 
<EOS>
so
she
e'en
resolved
to
sit
down
quietly
,
and
make
the
most
of
it
.
    
<EOS>
As
the
point
was
that
night
agreed
,
or
rather
determined
,
that
my
mother
should
lye
-
in
of
me
in
the
country
,
she
took
her
measures
accordingly
;
for
which
purpose
,
when
she
was
three
days
,
or
thereabouts
,
gone
with
child
<EOS>
,
she
began
to
cast
her
eyes
upon
the
midwife
,
whom
you
have
so
often
heard
me
mention
;
and
before
the
week
was
well
got
round
,
as
the
famous
Dr.
Manningham
was
not
to
be
had
,
she
had
come
to
a
final
determination
in
her
mind
,
 
notwithstanding
<EOS>
there
was
a
scientific
operator
within
so
near
a
call
as
eight
miles
of
us
,
and
who
,
moreover
,
had
expressly
wrote
a
five
shillings
book
upon
the
subject
of
midwifery
,
in
which
he
had
exposed
,
not
only
the
blunders
of
the
sisterhood
itself
,
 
but
had
likewise
super
-
added
many
curious
improvements
for
the
quicker
extraction
of
the
foetus
in
cross
births
,
and
some
other
cases
of
danger
,
which
belay
us
in
getting
into
the
world
;
notwithstanding
all
this
,
my
mother
,
I
say
,
was
absolutely
determined
to
trust
her
life
,
and
mine
with
it
,
into
no
soul
's
hand
but
this
old
woman
's
only
.
 
<EOS>
Now
this
I
like
;
 
when
we
can
not
get
at
the
very
thing
we
wish
 
never
to
take
up
with
the
next
best
in
degree
to
it
:
 
no
<EOS>
;
that
's
pitiful
beyond
description
;
 
it
is
no
more
than
a
week
from
this
very
day
,
in
which
I
am
now
writing
this
book
for
the
edification
of
the
world
;
 
which
is
March
9
,
1759
,
 
that
my
dear
,
dear
Jenny
,
observing
I
looked
a
little
grave
,
as
she
stood
cheapening
a
silk
of
five
-
and
-
twenty
shillings
a
yard
,
 
told
the
mercer
,
she
was
sorry
she
had
given
him
so
much
trouble
;
 
and
immediately
went
and
bought
herself
a
yard
-
wide
stuff
of
ten-
pence
a
yard
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
the
duplication
of
one
and
the
same
greatness
of
soul
;
only
what
lessened
the
honour
of
it
,
somewhat
,
in
my
mother
's
case
,
was
,
that
she
could
not
heroine
it
into
so
violent
and
hazardous
an
extreme
,
as
one
in
her
situation
might
have
wished
,
because
the
old
midwife
had
really
some
little
claim
to
be
depended
upon
,
 
as
much
,
at
least
,
as
success
could
give
her
;
having
,
in
the
course
of
her
practice
of
near
twenty
years
in
the
parish
,
brought
every
mother
's
son
of
them
into
the
world
without
any
one
slip
or
accident
which
could
fairly
be
laid
to
her
account
.
  
<EOS>
These
facts
,
tho
'
<EOS>
they
had
their
weight
,
yet
did
not
altogether
satisfy
some
few
scruples
and
uneasinesses
which
hung
upon
my
father
's
spirits
in
relation
to
this
choice
.
 
<EOS>
To
say
nothing
of
the
natural
workings
of
humanity
and
justice
 
or
of
the
yearnings
of
parental
and
connubial
love
,
all
which
prompted
him
to
leave
as
little
to
hazard
as
possible
in
a
case
of
this
kind
;
 
he
felt
himself
concerned
in
a
particular
manner
,
that
all
should
go
right
in
the
present
case
;
 
from
the
accumulated
sorrow
he
lay
open
to
,
should
any
evil
betide
his
wife
and
child
in
lying
-
in
at
Shandy-
Hall
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
the
world
judged
by
events
,
and
would
add
to
his
afflictions
in
such
a
misfortune
,
by
loading
him
with
the
whole
blame
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Alas
o'day
;
 
had
Mrs.
Shandy
,
poor
gentlewoman
!
<EOS>
had
but
her
wish
in
going
up
to
town
just
to
lye
-
in
and
come
down
again
;
 
<EOS>
which
they
say
,
she
begged
and
prayed
for
upon
her
bare
knees
,
 
and
which
,
in
my
opinion
,
considering
the
fortune
which
Mr.
Shandy
got
with
her
,
 
was
no
such
mighty
matter
to
have
complied
with
,
the
lady
and
her
babe
might
both
of
them
have
been
alive
at
this
hour
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
exclamation
,
my
father
knew
,
was
unanswerable
;
 
and
yet
,
it
was
not
merely
to
shelter
himself
,
 
nor
was
it
altogether
for
the
care
of
his
offspring
and
wife
that
he
seemed
so
extremely
anxious
about
this
point
<EOS>
;
  
my
father
had
extensive
views
of
things
,
 
and
stood
moreover
,
as
he
thought
,
deeply
concerned
in
it
for
the
publick
good
,
from
the
dread
he
entertained
of
the
bad
uses
an
ill
-
fated
instance
might
be
put
to
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
very
sensible
that
all
political
writers
upon
the
subject
had
unanimously
agreed
and
lamented
,
from
the
beginning
of
Queen
Elizabeth
's
reign
down
to
his
own
time
,
that
the
current
of
men
and
money
towards
the
metropolis
,
upon
one
frivolous
errand
or
another
,
 
set
in
so
strong
,
 
as
to
become
dangerous
to
our
civil
rights
,
 
though
,
by
the
bye
,
 
a
current
was
not
the
image
he
took
most
delight
in
,
 
a
distemper
was
here
his
favourite
metaphor
,
and
he
would
run
it
down
into
a
perfect
allegory
,
by
maintaining
it
was
identically
the
same
in
the
body
national
as
in
the
body
natural
,
where
the
blood
and
spirits
were
driven
up
into
the
head
faster
than
they
could
find
their
ways
down
;
 
a
stoppage
of
circulation
must
ensue
,
which
was
death
in
both
cases
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
little
danger
,
he
would
say
,
of
losing
our
liberties
by
French
politicks
or
French
invasions
;
 
nor
was
he
so
much
in
pain
of
a
consumption
from
the
mass
of
corrupted
matter
and
ulcerated
humours
in
our
constitution
,
which
he
hoped
was
not
so
bad
as
it
was
imagined
;
 
but
he
verily
feared
,
that
in
some
violent
push
,
we
should
go
off
,
all
at
once
,
in
a
state
-
apoplexy
;
 
and
then
he
would
say
,
The
Lord
have
mercy
upon
us
all
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
was
never
able
to
give
the
history
of
this
distemper
,
 
without
the
remedy
along
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Was
I
an
absolute
prince
,
"
he
would
say
,
pulling
up
his
breeches
with
both
his
hands
,
as
he
rose
from
his
arm
-
chair
,
"
I
would
appoint
able
judges
,
at
every
avenue
of
my
metropolis
,
who
should
take
cognizance
of
every
fool
's
business
who
came
there
;
 
and
if
,
upon
a
fair
and
candid
hearing
,
it
appeared
not
of
weight
sufficient
to
leave
his
own
home
,
and
come
up
,
bag
and
baggage
,
with
his
wife
and
children
,
farmer
's
sons
,
&
c.
&
c.
at
his
backside
,
they
should
be
all
sent
back
,
from
constable
to
constable
,
like
vagrants
as
they
were
,
to
the
place
of
their
legal
settlements
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
means
I
shall
take
care
,
that
my
metropolis
totter'd
not
thro
"
its
own
weight
;
 
that
the
head
be
no
longer
too
big
for
the
body
;
 
that
the
extremes
,
now
wasted
and
pinn'd
in
,
be
restored
to
their
due
share
of
nourishment
,
and
regain
with
it
their
natural
strength
and
beauty
:
 
<EOS>
I
would
effectually
provide
,
That
the
meadows
and
corn
fields
of
my
dominions
,
should
laugh
and
sing
;
 
that
good
chear
and
hospitality
flourish
once
more
;
 
and
that
such
weight
and
influence
be
put
thereby
into
the
hands
of
the
Squirality
of
my
kingdom
,
as
should
counterpoise
what
I
perceive
<EOS>
my
Nobility
are
now
taking
from
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
are
there
so
few
palaces
and
gentlemen
's
seats
,
"
he
would
ask
,
with
some
emotion
,
as
he
walked
across
the
room
,
"
throughout
so
many
delicious
provinces
in
France
?
 
<EOS>
Whence
is
it
that
the
few
remaining
Chateaus
amongst
them
are
so
dismantled
,
 
so
unfurnished
,
and
in
so
ruinous
and
desolate
a
condition
?
 
<EOS>
Because
,
Sir
"
(
he
would
say
)
"
in
that
kingdom
no
man
has
any
country
-
interest
to
support
;
 
the
little
interest
of
any
kind
which
any
man
has
any
where
in
it
,
is
concentrated
in
the
court
,
and
the
looks
of
the
Grand
Monarch
:
 
by
the
sunshine
of
whose
countenance
,
or
the
clouds
which
pass
across
it
,
every
French
man
lives
or
dies
.
"
  
<EOS>
Another
political
reason
which
prompted
my
father
so
strongly
to
guard
against
the
least
evil
accident
in
my
mother
's
lying
-
in
in
the
country
,
  
was
,
That
any
such
instance
would
infallibly
throw
a
balance
of
power
,
too
great
already
,
into
the
weaker
vessels
of
the
gentry
,
in
his
own
,
or
higher
stations
;
 
which
,
with
the
many
other
usurped
rights
which
that
part
of
the
constitution
was
hourly
establishing
,
 
would
,
in
the
end
,
prove
fatal
to
the
monarchical
system
of
domestick
government
established
in
the
first
creation
of
things
by
God
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
point
he
was
entirely
of
Sir
Robert
Filmer
's
opinion
,
That
the
plans
and
institutions
of
the
greatest
monarchies
in
the
eastern
parts
of
the
world
,
were
,
originally
,
all
stolen
from
that
admirable
pattern
and
prototype
of
this
houshold
and
paternal
power
;
 
which
,
for
a
century
,
he
said
,
and
more
,
had
gradually
been
degenerating
away
into
a
mix'd
government
;
 
<EOS>
the
form
of
which
,
however
desirable
in
great
combinations
of
the
species
,
 
was
very
troublesome
in
small
ones
,
 
and
seldom
produced
any
thing
,
that
he
saw
,
but
sorrow
and
confusion
.
  
<EOS>
For
all
these
reasons
,
private
and
publick
,
put
together
,
 
my
father
was
for
having
the
man
-
midwife
by
all
means
,
 
my
mother
,
by
no
means
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
begg'd
and
intreated
,
she
would
for
once
recede
from
her
prerogative
in
this
matter
,
and
suffer
him
to
choose
for
her
;
 
my
mother
,
on
the
contrary
,
insisted
upon
her
privilege
in
this
matter
,
to
choose
for
herself
,
 
and
have
no
mortal
's
help
but
<EOS>
the
old
woman
's
.
 
<EOS>
What
could
my
father
do
?
 
<EOS>
He
was
almost
at
his
wit
's
end
;
 
talked
it
over
with
her
in
all
moods
;
 
placed
his
arguments
in
all
lights
;
 
argued
the
matter
with
her
like
a
christian
,
 
like
a
heathen
,
 
like
a
husband
,
 
like
a
father
,
 
like
a
patriot
,
 
like
a
man
:
 
<EOS>
My
mother
answered
every
thing
only
like
a
woman
;
which
was
a
little
hard
upon
her
;
 
for
as
she
could
not
assume
and
fight
it
out
behind
such
a
variety
of
characters
,
 
'
twas
no
fair
match
:
 
'
twas
seven
to
one
.
 
<EOS>
What
could
my
mother
do
?
 
<EOS>
She
had
the
advantage
(
otherwise
she
had
been
certainly
overpowered
)
of
a
small
reinforcement
of
chagrin
personal
at
the
bottom
,
which
bore
her
up
,
and
enabled
her
to
dispute
the
affair
with
my
father
with
so
equal
an
advantage
,
 
that
both
sides
sung
Te
Deum
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
my
mother
was
to
have
the
old
woman
,
 
and
<EOS>
the
operator
was
to
have
licence
to
drink
a
bottle
of
wine
with
my
father
and
my
uncle
Toby
Shandy
in
the
back
parlour
,
 
for
which
he
was
to
be
paid
five
guineas
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
beg
leave
,
before
I
finish
this
chapter
,
to
enter
a
caveat
in
the
breast
of
my
fair
reader
;
 
and
it
is
this
,
 
Not
to
take
it
absolutely
for
granted
,
from
an
unguarded
word
or
two
which
I
have
dropp'd
<EOS>
in
it
,
 
"
That
I
am
a
married
man
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
own
,
the
tender
appellation
of
my
dear
,
dear
Jenny
,
  
with
some
other
strokes
of
conjugal
knowledge
,
interspersed
here
<EOS>
and
there
,
might
,
naturally
enough
,
have
misled
the
most
candid
judge
in
the
world
into
such
a
determination
against
me
.
 
<EOS>
All
I
plead
for
,
in
this
case
,
Madam
,
is
strict
justice
,
and
that
you
do
so
much
of
it
,
to
me
as
well
as
to
yourself
,
 
as
not
to
prejudge
,
or
receive
such
an
impression
of
me
,
till
you
have
better
evidence
,
than
,
I
am
positive
,
at
present
can
be
produced
against
me
.
 
<EOS>
Not
that
I
can
be
so
vain
or
unreasonable
,
<EOS>
Madam
,
as
to
desire
you
should
therefore
think
,
that
my
dear
,
dear
Jenny
is
my
kept
mistress
;
  
no
,
 
that
would
be
flattering
my
character
in
the
other
extreme
,
and
giving
it
an
air
of
freedom
,
which
,
perhaps
,
it
has
no
kind
of
right
to
.
 
<EOS>
All
I
contend
for
,
is
the
utter
impossibility
,
for
some
volumes
,
that
you
,
or
the
most
penetrating
spirit
upon
earth
,
should
know
how
this
matter
really
stands
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
impossible
,
but
that
my
dear
,
dear
Jenny
!
<EOS>
tender
as
the
appellation
is
,
may
be
my
child
.
 
<EOS>
Consider
,
 
<EOS>
I
was
born
in
the
year
eighteen
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
is
there
any
thing
unnatural
or
extravagant
in
the
supposition
,
that
my
dear
Jenny
may
be
my
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Friend
!
 
<EOS>
My
friend
.
  
<EOS>
Surely
,
Madam
,
a
friendship
between
the
two
sexes
may
subsist
,
and
be
supported
without
 
Fy
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Shandy
:
 
<EOS>
Without
any
thing
,
Madam
,
but
that
tender
and
delicious
sentiment
which
ever
mixes
in
friendship
,
where
there
is
a
difference
of
sex
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
intreat
you
to
study
the
pure
and
sentimental
parts
of
the
best
French
Romances
;
 
it
will
really
,
Madam
,
astonish
you
to
see
with
what
a
variety
of
chaste
expressions
this
delicious
sentiment
,
which
I
have
the
honour
to
speak
of
,
is
dress'd
out
.
    
<EOS>
I
would
sooner
undertake
to
explain
the
hardest
problem
in
geometry
,
than
pretend
to
account
for
it
,
that
a
gentleman
of
my
father
's
great
good
sense
,
 
knowing
,
as
the
reader
must
have
observed
him
,
and
curious
too
in
philosophy
,
 
wise
also
in
political
reasoning
,
 
and
in
polemical
(
as
he
will
find
)
no
way
ignorant
,
 
could
be
capable
of
entertaining
a
notion
in
his
head
,
so
out
of
the
common
track
,
 
that
I
fear
the
reader
,
when
I
come
to
mention
it
to
him
,
if
he
is
the
least
of
a
cholerick
temper
,
will
immediatly
throw
the
book
by
;
if
mercurial
,
he
will
laugh
most
heartily
at
it
;
 
and
if
he
is
of
a
grave
and
saturnine
<EOS>
cast
,
he
will
,
at
first
sight
,
absolutely
condemn
as
fanciful
and
extravagant
;
and
that
was
in
respect
to
the
choice
and
imposition
of
christian
names
,
on
which
he
thought
a
great
deal
more
depended
than
what
superficial
minds
were
capable
of
conceiving
.
  
<EOS>
His
opinion
,
in
this
matter
,
was
,
That
there
was
a
strange
kind
of
magick
bias
,
which
good
or
bad
names
,
as
he
called
them
,
irresistibly
impressed
upon
our
characters
and
conduct
.
  
<EOS>
The
hero
of
Cervantes
argued
not
the
point
with
more
seriousness
,
 
nor
had
he
more
faith
,
 
or
more
to
say
on
the
powers
of
necromancy
in
dishonouring
his
deeds
,
 
or
on
Dulcinea
's
name
,
in
shedding
lustre
upon
them
,
than
my
father
had
on
those
of
Trismegistus
or
Archimedes
,
on
the
one
hand
 
or
of
Nyky
and
Simkin
on
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
How
many
Caesars
and
Pompeys
,
he
would
say
,
by
mere
inspiration
of
the
names
,
have
been
rendered
worthy
of
them
?
 
<EOS>
And
how
many
,
he
would
add
,
are
there
,
who
might
have
done
exceeding
well
in
the
world
,
had
not
their
characters
and
spirits
been
totally
depressed
and
Nicodemus'd
into
nothing
?
  
<EOS>
I
see
plainly
,
Sir
,
by
your
looks
,
(
or
as
the
case
happened
)
<EOS>
my
father
would
say
 
that
you
do
not
heartily
subscribe
to
this
opinion
of
mine
,
  
which
,
to
those
,
he
would
add
,
who
have
not
carefully
sifted
it
to
the
bottom
,
 
<EOS>
I
own
has
an
air
more
of
fancy
than
of
solid
reasoning
in
it
;
 
and
yet
,
<EOS>
my
dear
Sir
,
if
I
may
presume
to
know
your
character
,
I
am
morally
assured
,
I
should
hazard
little
in
stating
a
case
to
you
,
not
as
a
party
in
the
dispute
,
 
but
as
a
judge
,
and
trusting
my
appeal
upon
it
to
your
own
good
sense
and
candid
disquisition
in
this
matter
;
 
you
are
a
person
free
from
as
many
narrow
prejudices
of
education
as
most
men
;
 
and
,
if
I
may
presume
to
penetrate
farther
into
you
,
 
of
a
liberality
of
genius
above
bearing
down
an
opinion
,
merely
because
it
wants
friends
.
 
<EOS>
Your
son
,
 
your
dear
son
,
 
from
whose
sweet
and
open
temper
you
have
so
much
to
expect
.
  
<EOS>
Your
Billy
,
Sir
!
 
<EOS>
would
you
,
for
the
world
,
have
called
him
Judas
?
 
<EOS>
Would
you
,
my
dear
Sir
,
he
would
say
,
laying
his
hand
upon
your
breast
,
with
the
genteelest
address
,
 
and
in
that
soft
and
irresistible
piano
of
voice
,
which
the
nature
of
the
argumentum
ad
hominem
absolutely
requires
<EOS>
,
 
Would
you
,
Sir
,
if
a
Jew
of
a
godfather
had
proposed
the
name
for
your
child
,
and
offered
you
his
purse
along
with
it
,
would
you
have
consented
to
such
a
desecration
of
him
?
 
<EOS>
O
my
God
!
<EOS>
he
would
say
,
looking
up
,
if
I
know
your
temper
<EOS>
right
<EOS>
,
Sir
,
 
you
are
incapable
of
it
;
 
you
would
have
trampled
upon
the
offer
;
 
you
would
have
thrown
the
temptation
at
the
tempter
's
head
with
abhorrence
.
  
<EOS>
Your
greatness
of
mind
in
this
action
,
which
I
admire
,
with
that
generous
contempt
of
money
,
which
you
shew
me
in
the
whole
transaction
,
is
really
noble
;
 
and
what
renders
it
more
so
,
is
the
principle
of
it
;
 
the
workings
of
a
parent
's
love
upon
the
truth
and
conviction
of
this
very
hypothesis
,
namely
,
That
was
your
son
called
Judas
,
 
<EOS>
the
forbid
and
treacherous
idea
,
so
inseparable
from
the
name
,
would
have
accompanied
him
through
life
like
his
shadow
,
and
,
in
the
end
,
made
a
miser
and
a
rascal
of
him
,
in
spite
,
Sir
,
of
your
example
.
  
<EOS>
I
never
knew
a
man
able
to
answer
this
argument
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
indeed
,
to
speak
of
my
father
as
he
was
;
 
he
was
certainly
irresistible
;
 
both
in
his
orations
and
disputations
;
 
he
was
born
an
orator
;
 
(
Greek
)
.
 
<EOS>
Persuasion
hung
upon
his
lips
,
and
the
elements
of
Logick
and
Rhetorick
were
so
blended
up
in
him
,
 
and
,
withal
,
he
had
so
shrewd
a
guess
at
the
weaknesses
and
passions
of
his
respondent
,
 
that
Nature
might
have
stood
up
and
said
,
 
"
This
man
is
eloquent
.
"
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
whether
he
was
on
the
weak
or
the
strong
side
of
the
question
,
'
twas
hazardous
in
either
case
to
attack
him
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
,
'
tis
strange
,
he
had
never
read
Cicero
,
nor
Quintilian
de
Oratore
,
nor
Isocrates
,
nor
Aristotle
,
nor
Longinus
,
amongst
the
antients
;
 
nor
Vossius
,
nor
Skioppius
,
nor
Ramus
,
nor
Farnaby
,
amongst
the
moderns
;
 
and
what
is
more
astonishing
,
he
had
never
in
his
whole
life
the
least
light
or
spark
of
subtilty
struck
into
his
mind
,
by
one
single
lecture
upon
Crackenthorp
or
Burgersdicius
or
any
Dutch
logician
or
commentator
;
 
he
knew
not
so
much
as
in
what
the
difference
of
an
argument
ad
ignorantiam
,
and
an
argument
ad
hominem
consisted
;
so
that
I
well
remember
,
when
he
went
up
along
with
me
to
enter
my
name
at
Jesus
College
in
.
.
.
<EOS>
,
 
<EOS>
it
was
a
matter
of
just
wonder
with
my
worthy
tutor
,
and
two
or
three
fellows
of
that
learned
society
,
  
that
a
man
who
knew
not
so
much
as
the
names
of
his
tools
,
should
be
able
to
work
after
that
fashion
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
To
work
with
them
in
the
best
manner
he
could
,
was
what
my
father
was
,
however
,
perpetually
forced
upon
;
 
for
he
had
a
thousand
little
sceptical
notions
of
the
comick
kind
to
defend
 
most
of
which
notions
,
I
verily
believe
,
at
first
entered
upon
the
footing
of
mere
whims
,
and
of
a
vive
la
Bagatelle
;
and
as
such
he
would
make
merry
with
them
for
half
an
hour
or
so
,
and
having
sharpened
his
wit
upon
them
,
dismiss
them
till
another
day
.
  
<EOS>
I
mention
this
,
not
only
as
matter
of
hypothesis
or
conjecture
upon
the
progress
and
establishment
of
my
father
's
many
odd
opinions
,
 
<EOS>
but
as
a
warning
to
the
learned
reader
against
the
indiscreet
reception
of
such
guests
,
who
,
after
a
free
and
undisturbed
entrance
,
for
some
years
,
into
our
brains
,
 
at
length
claim
a
kind
of
settlement
there
,
 
working
sometimes
like
yeast
;
 
but
more
generally
after
the
manner
of
the
gentle
passion
,
beginning
in
jest
,
 
but
ending
in
downright
earnest
.
  
<EOS>
Whether
this
was
the
case
of
the
singularity
of
my
father
's
notions
 
or
that
his
judgment
,
at
length
,
became
the
dupe
of
his
wit
;
 
or
how
far
,
in
many
of
his
notions
,
he
might
,
though
odd
,
be
absolutely
right
;
 
<EOS>
the
reader
,
as
he
comes
at
them
,
shall
decide
.
 
<EOS>
All
that
I
maintain
here
,
is
,
that
in
this
one
,
of
the
influence
of
christian
names
,
however
it
gained
footing
,
he
was
serious
;
 
he
was
all
uniformity
;
 
he
was
systematical
,
and
,
like
all
systematic
reasoners
,
he
would
move
both
heaven
and
earth
,
and
twist
and
torture
every
thing
in
nature
to
support
his
hypothesis
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
word
I
repeat
it
over
again
;
 
he
was
serious
;
 
and
,
in
consequence
of
it
,
he
would
lose
all
kind
of
patience
whenever
he
saw
people
,
especially
of
condition
,
who
should
have
known
better
,
 
as
careless
and
as
indifferent
about
the
name
they
imposed
upon
their
child
,
 
or
more
so
,
than
in
the
choice
of
Ponto
or
Cupid
for
their
puppy
-
dog
.
  
<EOS>
This
,
he
would
say
,
<EOS>
look'd
ill
;
 
and
had
,
moreover
,
this
particular
aggravation
in
it
,
viz
.
<EOS>
That
when
once
a
vile
name
was
wrongfully
or
injudiciously
given
,
'
twas
not
like
the
case
of
a
man
's
character
,
which
,
when
wrong'd
,
might
hereafter
be
cleared
;
 
and
,
possibly
,
some
time
or
other
,
if
not
in
the
man
's
life
,
at
least
after
his
death
,
 
be
,
somehow
or
other
,
set
to
rights
with
the
world
:
 
But
the
injury
of
this
,
he
would
say
,
could
never
be
undone
;
 
nay
,
he
doubted
even
whether
an
act
of
parliament
could
reach
it
:
 
<EOS>
He
knew
as
well
as
you
,
that
the
legislature
assumed
a
power
over
surnames
;
 
but
for
very
strong
reasons
,
which
he
could
give
,
it
had
never
yet
adventured
,
he
would
say
,
to
go
a
step
farther
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
observable
,
that
tho
'
my
father
,
in
consequence
of
this
opinion
,
had
,
as
I
have
told
you
,
the
strongest
likings
and
dislikings
towards
certain
names
;
 
that
there
were
still
numbers
of
names
which
hung
so
equally
in
the
balance
before
him
,
that
they
were
absolutely
indifferent
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
,
Dick
,
and
Tom
were
of
this
class
:
 
<EOS>
These
my
father
called
neutral
names
;
 
affirming
of
them
,
without
a
satire
<EOS>
,
That
there
had
been
as
many
knaves
and
fools
,
at
least
,
as
wise
and
good
men
,
since
the
world
began
,
who
had
indifferently
borne
them
;
 
so
that
,
like
equal
forces
acting
against
each
other
in
contrary
directions
,
he
thought
they
mutually
destroyed
each
other
's
effects
;
for
which
reason
,
he
would
often
declare
,
He
would
not
give
a
cherry
-
stone
to
choose
amongst
them
.
 
<EOS>
Bob
,
which
was
my
brother
's
name
,
was
another
of
these
neutral
kinds
of
christian
names
,
which
operated
very
little
either
way
;
and
as
my
father
happen'd
to
be
at
Epsom
,
when
it
was
given
him
,
 
he
would
oft
-
times
thank
Heaven
<EOS>
it
was
no
worse
.
 
<EOS>
Andrew
was
something
like
a
negative
quantity
in
Algebra
with
him
;
 
'
twas
worse
,
he
said
,
than
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
William
stood
pretty
high
:
 
<EOS>
Numps
again
was
low
with
him
:
 
and
Nick
,
he
said
,
was
the
Devil
.
  
<EOS>
But
of
all
names
in
the
universe
<EOS>
he
had
the
most
unconquerable
aversion
for
Tristram
;
 
he
had
the
lowest
and
most
contemptible
opinion
of
it
of
any
thing
in
the
world
,
 
thinking
it
could
possibly
produce
nothing
in
rerum
natura
,
but
what
was
extremely
mean
and
pitiful
:
 
So
that
in
the
midst
of
a
dispute
on
the
subject
,
in
which
,
by
the
bye
,
he
was
frequently
involved
,
  
he
would
sometimes
break
off
in
a
sudden
and
spirited
Epiphonema
,
or
rather
Erotesis
,
raised
a
third
,
and
sometimes
a
full
fifth
above
the
key
of
the
discourse
,
 
and
demand
it
categorically
of
his
antagonist
,
Whether
he
would
take
upon
him
to
say
,
he
had
ever
remembered
,
 
whether
he
had
ever
read
,
  
or
even
whether
he
had
ever
heard
tell
of
a
man
,
called
Tristram
,
performing
any
thing
great
or
worth
recording
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
 
he
would
say
,
  
Tristram
!
 
<EOS>
The
thing
is
impossible
.
  
<EOS>
What
could
be
wanting
in
my
father
but
to
have
wrote
a
book
to
publish
this
notion
of
his
to
the
world
?
 
<EOS>
Little
boots
it
to
the
subtle
speculatist
to
stand
single
in
his
opinions
,
 
unless
he
gives
them
proper
vent
:
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
identical
thing
which
my
father
did
:
 
for
in
the
year
sixteen
,
<EOS>
which
was
two
years
before
I
was
born
,
he
was
at
the
pains
of
writing
an
express
Dissertation
simply
upon
the
word
<EOS>
Tristram
,
 
shewing
the
world
,
with
great
candour
and
modesty
,
the
grounds
of
his
great
abhorrence
to
the
name
.
  
<EOS>
When
this
story
is
compared
with
the
title
-
page
,
 
Will
not
the
gentle
reader
pity
my
father
from
his
soul
?
 
<EOS>
to
see
an
orderly
and
well
-
disposed
gentleman
,
who
tho
'
singular
,
 
yet
inoffensive
in
his
notions
,
 
so
played
upon
in
them
by
cross
purposes
;
 
to
look
down
upon
the
stage
,
and
see
him
baffled
and
overthrown
in
all
his
little
systems
and
wishes
;
to
behold
a
train
of
events
perpetually
falling
out
against
him
,
and
in
so
critical
and
cruel
a
way
,
as
if
they
had
purposedly
been
plann'd
and
pointed
against
him
,
merely
to
insult
his
speculations
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
to
behold
such
a
one
,
in
his
old
age
,
ill
-
fitted
for
troubles
,
ten
times
in
a
day
suffering
sorrow
;
 
ten
times
in
a
day
calling
the
child
of
his
prayers
Tristram
!
  
<EOS>
Melancholy
dissyllable
of
sound
!
<EOS>
which
,
to
his
ears
,
was
unison
to
Nincompoop
,
and
every
name
vituperative
under
heaven
.
 
<EOS>
By
his
ashes
!
<EOS>
I
swear
it
,
 
if
ever
malignant
spirit
took
pleasure
,
or
busied
itself
in
traversing
the
purposes
of
mortal
man
,
 
it
must
have
been
here
;
 
and
if
it
was
not
necessary
I
should
be
born
before
I
was
christened
,
I
would
this
moment
give
the
reader
an
account
of
it
.
      
<EOS>
How
could
you
,
Madam
,
be
so
inattentive
in
reading
the
last
chapter
?
 
<EOS>
I
told
you
in
it
,
That
my
mother
was
not
a
papist
.
 
<EOS>
Papist
!
 
<EOS>
You
told
me
no
such
thing
,
Sir
.
 
<EOS>
Madam
,
I
beg
leave
to
repeat
it
over
again
,
that
I
told
you
as
plain
,
at
least
,
as
words
,
by
direct
inference
,
could
tell
you
such
a
thing
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
Sir
,
I
must
have
miss'd
a
page
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
Madam
,
you
have
not
<EOS>
miss'd
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
was
asleep
,
Sir
.
 
<EOS>
My
pride
,
Madam
,
can
not
allow
you
that
refuge
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
I
declare
,
I
know
nothing
at
all
about
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
That
,
Madam
,
is
the
very
fault
I
lay
to
your
charge
;
and
as
a
punishment
for
it
,
I
do
insist
upon
it
,
that
you
immediately
turn
back
,
that
is
as
soon
as
you
get
to
the
next
full
stop
,
and
read
the
whole
chapter
over
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
imposed
this
penance
upon
the
lady
,
neither
out
of
wantonness
nor
cruelty
;
but
from
the
best
of
motives
;
and
therefore
shall
make
her
no
apology
for
it
when
she
returns
back
:
 
'
Tis
to
rebuke
a
vicious
taste
,
which
has
crept
into
thousands
besides
herself
,
 
of
reading
straight
forwards
,
more
in
quest
of
the
adventures
,
than
of
the
deep
erudition
and
knowledge
which
a
book
of
this
cast
,
if
read
over
as
it
should
be
,
would
infallibly
impart
with
them
 
<EOS>
The
mind
should
be
accustomed
to
make
wise
reflections
,
and
draw
curious
conclusions
as
it
goes
along
;
the
habitude
of
which
made
Pliny
the
younger
affirm
,
"
That
he
never
read
a
book
so
bad
,
but
he
drew
some
profit
from
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
stories
of
Greece
and
Rome
,
run
over
without
this
turn
and
application
,
 
do
less
service
,
I
affirm
it
,
than
the
history
of
Parismus
and
Parismenus
,
or
of
the
Seven
Champions
of
England
,
read
with
it
.
    
<EOS>
But
here
comes
my
fair
lady
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
read
over
again
the
chapter
,
Madam
,
as
I
desired
you
?
 
<EOS>
You
have
:
 
<EOS>
And
did
you
not
observe
the
passage
,
upon
the
second
reading
,
which
admits
the
inference
?
 
<EOS>
Not
a
word
like
it
!
 
<EOS>
Then
,
Madam
,
be
pleased
to
ponder
well
the
last
line
but
one
of
the
chapter
,
where
I
take
upon
me
to
say
,
"
It
was
necessary
I
should
be
born
before
I
was
christen'd
.
<EOS>
"
 
Had
my
mother
,
Madam
,
been
a
Papist
,
that
consequence
did
not
follow
.
 
<EOS>
(
The
Romish
Rituals
direct
the
baptizing
of
the
child
,
in
cases
of
danger
,
before
it
is
born
;
 
but
upon
this
proviso
,
That
some
part
or
other
of
the
child
's
body
be
seen
by
the
baptizer
:
 
But
the
Doctors
of
the
Sorbonne
,
by
a
deliberation
held
amongst
them
,
April
10
,
1733
,
 
have
enlarged
the
powers
of
the
midwives
,
by
determining
,
That
though
no
part
of
the
child
's
body
should
appear
,
 
that
baptism
shall
,
nevertheless
,
be
administered
to
it

the
Doctors

thereupon

it
is

It
is
a
terrible
misfortune
for
this
same
book
of
mine
,
but
more
so
to
the
Republick
of
letters
;
 
so
that
my
own
is
quite
swallowed
up
in
the
consideration
of
it
,
 
that
this
self
-
same
vile
pruriency
for
fresh
adventures
in
all
things
,
has
got
so
strongly
into
our
habit
and
humour
,
  
and
so
wholly
intent
are
we
upon
satisfying
the
impatience
of
our
concupiscence
that
way
,
 
that
nothing
but
the
gross
and
more
carnal
parts
of
a
composition
will
go
down
:
 
<EOS>
The
subtle
hints
and
sly
communications
of
science
fly
off
,
like
spirits
upwards
,
 
the
heavy
moral
escapes
downwards
;
and
both
the
one
and
the
other
are
as
much
lost
to
the
world
,
as
if
they
were
still
left
in
the
bottom
of
the
ink

I
wish
the
male

reader
has
not
pass'd
by
many
a
one
,
as
quaint
and
curious
as
this
one
,
in
which
the
female

has
been
detected

I
wish
it
may
have
its
effects

that
all

both

the

all

do
well

come
safe
into

this
,
that
each
and
every
of
them
shall
be
baptized
again

provided

I
wonder
what
's
all
that
noise
,
and
running
backwards

quoth
<EOS>
my

,
addressing
himself
,
after
an
hour
and
a
half
's
silence
,
to
my
uncle
Toby
,
 
<EOS>
who
,
you
must
know
,
was
sitting
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
fire
,
smoaking
his
social
pipe
all
the
time
,
in
mute
contemplation
of
a
new
pair
of
black
plush
-
breeches
which
he
had
got
on
:
  
<EOS>
What
can
they
be
doing
,
brother
?
 
<EOS>
quoth
<EOS>
my
father
,
 
we
can
scarce
hear
ourselves
talk
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
,
taking
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
,
and
striking
the
head
of
it
two
or
three
times
upon
the
nail
of
his
left
thumb
,
as
he
began
his
sentence
,
 
I
think
,
says
he
:
 
But
to
enter
rightly
into
my
uncle
Toby
's
sentiments
upon
this
matter
,
you
must
be
made
to
enter
first
a
little
into
his
character
,
the
out
-
lines
of
which
I
shall
just
give
you
,
and
then
the
dialogue
between
him
and
my
father
will
go
on
as
well
again
.
  
<EOS>
Pray
what
was
that
man
's
name
,
 
for
I
write
in
such
a
hurry
,
I
have
no
time
to
recollect
or
look
for
it
,
 
who
first
made
the
observation
,
"
That
there
was
great
inconstancy
in
our
air
and
climate
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Whoever
he
was
,
'
twas
a
just
and
good
observation
in
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
corollary
drawn
from
it
,
namely
,
"
That
it
is
this
which
has
furnished
us
with
such
a
variety
of
odd
and
whimsical
characters
;
"
 
that
was
not
his
;
 
it
was
found
out
by
another
man
,
<EOS>
at
least
a
century
and
a
half
after
him
:
 
<EOS>
Then
again
,
 
that
this
copious
store
-
house
of
original
materials
,
is
the
true
and
natural
cause
that
our
Comedies
are
so
much
better
than
those
of
France
,
or
any
others
that
either
have
,
or
can
be
wrote
upon
the
Continent
:
 
<EOS>
that
discovery
was
not
fully
made
till
about
the
middle
of
King
William
's
reign
,
 
when
the
great
Dryden
,
in
writing
one
of
his
long
prefaces
,
(
if
I
mistake
not
)
most
fortunately
hit
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
toward
the
latter
end
of
queen
Anne
,
the
great
Addison
began
to
patronize
the
notion
,
and
more
fully
explained
it
to
the
world
in
one
or
two
of
his
Spectators
;
 
but
the
discovery
was
not
his
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
fourthly
and
lastly
,
that
this
strange
irregularity
in
our
climate
,
producing
so
strange
an
irregularity
in
our
characters
,
 
doth
thereby
,
in
some
sort
,
make
us
amends
,
by
giving
us
somewhat
to
make
us
merry
with
when
the
weather
will
not
suffer
us
to
go
out
of
doors
,
 
that
observation
is
my
own
;
 
and
was
struck
out
by
me
this
very
rainy
day
,
March
26
,
1759
,
and
betwixt
the
hours
of
nine
and
ten
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
 
thus
,
my
fellow
-
labourers
and
associates
in
this
great
harvest
of
our
learning
,
now
ripening
before
our
eyes
;
thus
it
is
,
by
slow
steps
of
casual
increase
,
that
our
knowledge
physical
,
metaphysical
,
physiological
,
polemical
,
nautical
,
mathematical
,
aenigmatical
,
technical
,
biographical
,
romantical
,
chemical
,
and
obstetrical
,
with
fifty
other
branches
of
it
,
(
most
of
'em
ending
as
these
do
,
in
ical
)
have
for
these
two
last
centuries
and
more
,
gradually
been
creeping
upwards
towards
that
Akme
of
their
perfections
,
from
which
,
if
we
may
form
a
conjecture
from
the
advances
of
these
last
seven
years
,
we
can
not
possibly
be
far
off
.
  
<EOS>
When
that
happens
,
it
is
to
be
hoped
,
it
will
put
an
end
to
all
kind
of
writings
whatsoever
;
 
the
want
of
all
kind
of
writing
will
put
an
end
to
all
kind
of
reading
;
 
and
that
in
time
,
As
war
begets
poverty
;
poverty
peace
,
 
must
,
in
course
,
put
an
end
to
all
kind
of
knowledge
,
 
and
then
 
we
shall
have
all
to
begin
over
again
;
or
,
in
other
words
,
be
exactly
where
we
started
.
    
<EOS>
Happy
!
 
<EOS>
Thrice
happy
times
!
 
<EOS>
I
only
wish
that
the
aera
of
my
begetting
,
as
well
as
the
mode
and
manner
of
it
,
had
been
a
little
alter'd
,
 
or
that
it
could
have
been
put
off
,
with
any
convenience
to
my
father
or
mother
,
for
some
twenty
or
five
-
and
-
twenty
years
longer
,
when
a
man
in
the
literary
world
might
have
stood
some
chance
.
    
<EOS>
But
I
forget
my
uncle
Toby
,
whom
all
this
while
we
have
left
knocking
the
ashes
out
of
his
tobacco
-
pipe
.
  
<EOS>
His
humour
was
of
that
particular
species
,
which
does
honour
to
our
atmosphere
;
and
I
should
have
made
no
scruple
of
ranking
him
amongst
one
of
the
first
-
rate
productions
of
it
,
had
not
there
appeared
too
many
strong
lines
in
it
of
a
family
-
likeness
,
which
shewed
that
he
derived
the
singularity
of
his
temper
more
from
blood
,
than
either
wind
or
water
,
or
any
modifications
or
combinations
of
them
<EOS>
whatever
:
 
<EOS>
And
I
have
,
therefore
,
oft
-
times
wondered
,
that
my
father
,
tho
'
<EOS>
I
believe
he
had
his
reasons
for
it
,
upon
his
observing
some
tokens
of
eccentricity
,
in
my
course
,
when
I
was
a
boy
,
 
should
never
once
endeavour
to
account
for
them
in
this
way
:
 
for
<EOS>
all
the
Shandy
Family
were
of
an
original
character
throughout
:
 
<EOS>
I
mean
the
males
,
 
the
females
had
no
character
at
all
,
 
except
,
indeed
,
my
great
aunt
Dinah
,
who
,
about
sixty
years
ago
,
was
married
and
got
with
child
by
the
coachman
,
for
which
my
father
,
according
to
his
hypothesis
of
christian
names
,
would
often
say
,
<EOS>
She
might
thank
her
godfathers
and
godmothers
.
  
<EOS>
It
will
seem
strange
,
 
and
I
would
as
soon
think
of
dropping
a
riddle
in
the
reader
's
way
,
which
is
not
my
interest
to
do
,
as
set
him
upon
guessing
how
it
could
come
to
pass
,
that
an
event
of
this
kind
,
so
many
years
after
it
had
happened
,
should
be
reserved
for
the
interruption
of
the
peace
and
unity
,
which
otherwise
so
cordially
subsisted
,
between
my
father
and
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
One
would
have
thought
,
that
the
whole
force
of
the
misfortune
should
have
spent
and
wasted
itself
in
the
family
at
first
,
 
as
is
generally
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
But
nothing
ever
wrought
with
our
family
after
the
ordinary
way
.
 
<EOS>
Possibly
at
the
very
time
this
happened
,
it
might
have
something
else
to
afflict
it
;
and
as
afflictions
are
sent
down
for
our
good
,
and
that
as
this
had
never
done
the
Shandy
Family
<EOS>
any
good
at
all
,
it
might
lie
waiting
till
apt
times
and
circumstances
should
give
it
an
opportunity
to
discharge
its
office
.
 
<EOS>
Observe
,
I
determine
nothing
upon
this
.
 
<EOS>
My
way
is
ever
to
point
out
to
the
curious
,
different
tracts
of
investigation
,
to
come
at
the
first
springs
of
the
events
I
tell
;
 
not
with
a
pedantic
Fescue
,
 
or
in
the
decisive
manner
or
Tacitus
,
who
outwits
himself
and
his
reader
;
 
but
with
the
officious
humility
of
a
heart
devoted
to
the
assistance
merely
of
the
inquisitive
;
 
to
them
<EOS>
I
write
,
 
and
by
them
I
shall
be
read
,
 
if
any
such
reading
as
this
could
be
supposed
to
hold
out
so
long
,
 
to
the
very
end
of
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
Why
this
cause
of
sorrow
,
therefore
,
was
thus
reserved
for
my
father
and
uncle
,
is
undetermined
by
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
how
and
in
what
direction
it
exerted
itself
so
as
to
become
the
cause
of
dissatisfaction
between
them
,
<EOS>
after
it
began
to
operate
,
is
what
I
am
able
to
explain
with
great
exactness
,
and
is
as
follows
:
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
Shandy
,
Madam
,
was
a
gentleman
,
who
,
with
the
virtues
which
usually
constitute
the
character
of
a
man
of
honour
and
rectitude
,
  
possessed
one
in
a
very
eminent
degree
,
which
is
seldom
or
never
put
into
the
catalogue
;
and
that
was
a
most
extreme
and
unparallel'd
modesty
of
nature
;
 
though
I
correct
the
word
nature
,
for
this
reason
,
that
I
may
not
prejudge
a
point
which
must
shortly
come
to
a
hearing
,
and
that
is
,
Whether
this
modesty
of
his
was
natural
or
acquir'd
.
 
<EOS>
Whichever
way
my
uncle
Toby
came
by
it
,
'
twas
nevertheless
modesty
in
the
truest
sense
of
it
;
and
that
is
,
Madam
,
not
in
regard
to
words
,
for
he
was
so
unhappy
as
to
have
very
little
choice
in
them
,
 
but
to
things
;
 
and
this
kind
of
modesty
so
possessed
him
,
and
it
arose
to
such
a
height
in
him
,
as
almost
to
equal
,
if
such
a
thing
could
be
,
even
the
modesty
of
a
woman
:
 
<EOS>
That
female
nicety
,
Madam
,
and
<EOS>
inward
cleanliness
of
mind
and
fancy
,
in
your
sex
,
which
makes
you
so
much
the
awe
of
ours
.
  
<EOS>
You
will
imagine
,
Madam
,
that
my
uncle
Toby
had
contracted
all
this
from
this
very
source
;
 
that
he
had
spent
a
great
part
of
his
time
in
converse
with
your
sex
,
and
that
from
a
thorough
knowledge
of
you
,
and
the
force
of
imitation
which
such
fair
examples
render
irresistible
,
he
had
acquired
this
amiable
turn
of
mind
.
  
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
say
so
,
 
for
unless
it
was
with
his
sister
-
in
-
law
,
my
father
's
wife
and
my
mother
 
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
scarce
exchanged
three
words
with
the
sex
in
as
many
years
;
 
no
,
he
got
it
,
Madam
,
by
a
blow
.
 
<EOS>
A
blow
!
  
<EOS>
Yes
,
Madam
,
it
was
owing
to
a
blow
from
a
stone
,
broke
off
by
a
ball
from
the
parapet
of
a
horn
-
work
at
the
siege
of
Namur
,
which
struck
full
upon
my
uncle
Toby
's
groin
.
 
<EOS>
Which
way
could
that
effect
it
?
 
<EOS>
The
story
of
that
,
Madam
,
is
long
and
interesting
;
 
but
it
would
be
running
my
history
all
upon
heaps
to
give
it
you
here
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
for
an
episode
hereafter
;
and
every
circumstance
relating
to
it
,
in
its
proper
place
,
shall
be
faithfully
laid
before
you
:
 
<EOS>
"
Till
then
,
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
give
farther
light
into
this
matter
,
or
say
more
than
what
I
have
said
already
,
 
That
my
uncle
Toby
was
a
gentleman
of
unparallel'd
modesty
,
which
happening
to
be
somewhat
subtilized
and
rarified
by
the
constant
heat
of
a
little
family
pride
,
  
they
both
so
wrought
together
within
him
,
that
he
could
never
bear
to
hear
the
affair
of
my
aunt
Dinah
touch'd
upon
,
but
with
the
greatest
emotion
.
  
<EOS>
The
least
hint
of
it
was
enough
to
make
the
blood
fly
into
his
face
;
 
but
when
my
father
enlarged
upon
the
story
in
mixed
companies
,
which
the
illustration
of
his
hypothesis
frequently
obliged
him
to
do
,
 
the
unfortunate
blight
of
one
of
the
fairest
branches
of
the
family
,
would
set
my
uncle
Toby
's
honour
and
modesty
o'bleeding
;
and
he
would
often
take
my
father
aside
,
in
the
greatest
concern
imaginable
,
to
expostulate
and
tell
him
,
he
would
give
him
any
thing
in
the
world
,
only
to
let
the
story
rest
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
,
I
believe
,
had
the
truest
love
and
tenderness
for
my
uncle
Toby
,
that
ever
one
brother
bore
towards
another
,
and
would
have
done
any
thing
in
nature
,
which
one
brother
in
reason
could
have
desir'd
of
another
,
to
have
made
my
uncle
Toby
's
heart
easy
in
this
,
or
any
other
point
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
lay
out
of
his
power
.
     
<EOS>
My
father
,
as
I
told
you
was
a
philosopher
in
grain
,
 
<EOS>
speculative
,
  
systematical
;
 
and
my
aunt
Dinah
's
affair
<EOS>
was
a
matter
of
as
much
consequence
to
him
,
as
the
retrogradation
of
the
planets
to
Copernicus
:
  
<EOS>
The
backslidings
of
Venus
in
her
orbit
fortified
the
Copernican
system
,
called
so
after
his
name
;
and
the
backslidings
of
my
aunt
Dinah
in
her
orbit
,
did
the
same
service
in
establishing
my
father
's
system
,
which
,
I
trust
,
will
for
ever
hereafter
be
called
the
Shandean
System
,
after
his
.
  
<EOS>
In
any
other
family
dishonour
,
my
father
,
I
believe
,
had
as
nice
a
sense
of
shame
as
any
man
whatever
;
 
and
neither
he
,
nor
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
Copernicus
,
would
have
divulged
the
affair
in
either
case
,
or
have
taken
the
least
notice
of
it
to
the
world
,
but
for
the
obligations
they
owed
,
as
they
thought
,
to
truth
.
 
<EOS>
Amicus
Plato
,
my
father
would
say
,
construing
the
words
to
my
uncle
Toby
,
as
he
went
along
,
Amicus
Plato
;
that
is
,
Dinah
was
my
aunt
;
 
sed
magis
amica
veritas
 
<EOS>
but
Truth
is
my
sister
.
  
<EOS>
This
contrariety
of
humours
betwixt
my
father
and
my
uncle
,
was
the
source
of
many
a
fraternal
squabble
.
 
<EOS>
The
one
could
not
bear
to
hear
the
tale
of
family
disgrace
recorded
,
 
and
the
other
would
scarce
ever
let
a
day
pass
to
an
end
without
some
hint
at
it
.
  
<EOS>
For
God
's
sake
,
my
uncle
Toby
would
cry
,
 
and
for
my
sake
,
and
for
all
our
sakes
,
my
dear
brother
Shandy
,
 
do
let
this
story
of
our
aunt
's
and
her
ashes
sleep
in
peace
;
 
how
can
you
,
 
how
can
you
have
so
little
feeling
and
compassion
for
the
character
of
our
family
?
 
<EOS>
What
is
the
character
of
a
family
to
an
hypothesis
?
<EOS>
my
father
would
reply
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
if
you
come
to
that
  
what
is
the
life
of
a
family
?
 
<EOS>
The
life
of
a
family
!
 
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
would
say
,
throwing
himself
back
in
his
arm
chair
,
and
lifting
up
his
hands
,
his
eyes
,
and
one
leg
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
the
life
,
 
my
father
would
say
,
maintaining
his
point
.
 
<EOS>
How
many
thousands
of
'em
are
there
every
year
that
come
cast
away
,
(
in
all
civilized
countries
at
least
)
 
and
considered
as
nothing
but
common
air
,
in
competition
of
an
hypothesis
.
 
<EOS>
In
my
plain
sense
of
things
,
my
uncle
Toby
would
answer
,
 
<EOS>
every
such
instance
is
downright
Murder
,
let
who
will
commit
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
lies
your
mistake
,
my
father
would
reply
;
 
for
,
in
Foro
Scientiae
there
is
no
such
thing
as
Murder
,
 
'
tis
<EOS>
only
Death
,
brother
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
would
never
offer
to
answer
this
by
any
other
kind
of
argument
,
than
that
of
whistling
half
a
dozen
bars
of
Lillebullero
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
know
it
was
the
usual
channel
thro
'
which
his
passions
got
vent
,
when
any
thing
shocked
or
surprized
him
:
 
but
especially
when
any
thing
,
which
he
deem'd
very
absurd
,
was
offered
.
  
<EOS>
As
not
one
of
our
logical
writers
,
nor
any
of
the
commentators
upon
them
,
that
I
remember
,
have
thought
proper
to
give
a
name
to
this
particular
species
of
argument
.
 
<EOS>
I
here
take
the
liberty
to
do
it
myself
,
for
two
reasons
.
 
<EOS>
First
,
That
,
in
order
to
prevent
all
confusion
in
disputes
,
it
may
stand
as
much
distinguished
for
ever
,
from
every
other
species
of
argument
 
as
the
Argumentum
ad
Verecundiam
,
ex
Absurdo
,
ex
Fortiori
,
or
any
other
argument
whatsoever
:
 
And
,
secondly
,
That
it
may
be
said
by
my
children
's
children
,
when
my
head
is
laid
to
rest
,
 
that
their
learn'd
grandfather
's
head
had
been
busied
to
as
much
purpose
once
,
as
other
people
's
;
 
That
he
had
invented
a
name
,
and
generously
thrown
it
into
the
Treasury
of
the
Ars
Logica
,
for
one
of
the
most
unanswerable
arguments
in
the
whole
science
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
if
the
end
of
disputation
is
more
to
silence
than
convince
,
 
they
may
add
,
if
they
please
,
to
one
of
the
best
arguments
too
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
,
therefore
,
by
these
presents
,
strictly
order
and
command
,
That
it
be
known
and
distinguished
by
the
name
and
title
of
the
Argumentum
Fistulatorium
,
and
no
other
;
 
and
that
it
rank
hereafter
with
the
Argumentum
Baculinum
and
the
Argumentum
ad
Crumenam
,
and
for
ever
hereafter
be
treated
of
in
the
same
chapter
.
   
<EOS>
As
for
the
Argumentum
Tripodium
,
which
is
never
used
but
by
the
woman
against
the
man
;
 
and
the
Argumentum
ad
Rem
,
which
,
contrarywise
,
is
made
use
of
by
the
man
only
against
the
woman
;
 
As
these
two
are
enough
in
conscience
for
one
lecture
;
 
and
,
moreover
,
as
the
one
is
the
best
answer
to
the
other
,
 
let
them
likewise
be
kept
apart
,
and
be
treated
of
in
a
place
by
themselves
.
    
<EOS>
The
learned
Bishop
Hall
<EOS>
,
I
mean
the
famous
Dr.
Joseph
Hall
,
who
was
Bishop
of
Exeter
in
King
James
the
First
's
reign
,
tells
us
in
one
of
Decads
,
at
the
end
of
his
divine
art
of
meditation
,
imprinted
at
London
,
in
the
year
1610
,
by
John
Beal
,
dwelling
in
Aldersgate
-
street
,
"
That
it
is
an
abominable
thing
for
a
man
to
commend
himself
;
"
 
and
<EOS>
I
really
think
it
is
so
.
  
<EOS>
And
yet
,
on
the
other
hand
,
when
a
thing
is
executed
in
a
masterly
kind
of
a
fashion
,
which
thing
is
not
likely
to
be
found
out
;
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
is
full
as
abominable
,
that
a
man
should
lose
the
honour
of
it
,
and
go
out
of
the
world
with
the
conceit
of
it
rotting
in
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
This
is
precisely
my
situation
.
   
<EOS>
For
in
this
long
digression
which
I
was
accidentally
led
into
,
as
in
all
my
digressions
(
one
only
excepted
)
<EOS>
there
is
a
master
-
stroke
of
digressive
skill
,
the
merit
of
which
has
all
along
,
I
fear
,
been
over
-
looked
by
my
reader
,
 
not
for
want
of
penetration
in
him
,
 
but
because
'
tis
an
excellence
seldom
looked
for
,
or
expected
indeed
,
in
a
digression
;
 
and
it
is
this
:
 
<EOS>
That
tho
"
<EOS>
my
digressions
are
all
fair
,
as
you
observe
,
 
and
that
I
fly
off
from
what
I
am
about
,
as
far
,
and
as
often
too
,
as
any
writer
in
Great
Britain
;
yet
I
constantly
take
care
to
order
affairs
so
that
my
main
business
does
not
stand
still
in
my
absence
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
just
going
,
for
example
,
to
have
given
you
the
great
out
-
lines
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
most
whimsical
character
;
 
when
my
aunt
Dinah
and
the
coachman
came
across
us
,
and
led
us
a
vagary
some
millions
of
miles
into
the
very
heart
of
the
planetary
system
:
 
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
all
this
,
you
perceive
that
the
drawing
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
character
went
on
gently
all
the
time
;
 
not
the
great
contours
of
it
,
 
<EOS>
that
was
impossible
,
 
but
some
familiar
strokes
and
faint
designations
of
it
,
were
here
and
there
touch'd
<EOS>
on
,
as
we
went
along
,
so
that
you
are
much
better
acquainted
with
my
uncle
Toby
now
than
you
was
before
.
  
<EOS>
By
this
contrivance
the
machinery
of
my
work
is
of
a
species
by
itself
;
two
contrary
motions
are
introduced
into
it
,
and
reconciled
,
which
were
thought
to
be
at
variance
with
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
my
work
is
digressive
,
and
it
is
progressive
too
,
 
and
at
the
same
time
.
  
<EOS>
This
,
Sir
,
is
a
very
different
story
from
that
of
the
earth
's
moving
round
<EOS>
her
axis
,
in
her
diurnal
rotation
,
with
her
progress
in
her
elliptick
orbit
which
brings
about
the
year
,
and
constitutes
that
variety
and
vicissitude
of
seasons
we
enjoy
;
 
though
I
own
<EOS>
it
suggested
the
thought
,
 
as
I
believe
the
greatest
of
our
boasted
improvements
and
discoveries
have
come
from
such
trifling
hints
.
  
<EOS>
Digressions
,
incontestably
,
are
the
sunshine
;
 
they
are
the
life
,
the
soul
of
reading
!
 
<EOS>
take
them
out
of
this
book
,
for
instance
,
 
you
might
as
well
take
the
book
along
with
them
;
 
one
cold
eternal
winter
would
reign
in
every
page
of
it
;
restore
them
to
the
writer
;
 
he
steps
forth
like
a
bridegroom
,
 
bids
All
-
hail
;
brings
in
variety
,
and
forbids
the
appetite
to
fail
.
  
<EOS>
All
the
dexterity
is
in
the
good
cookery
and
management
of
them
,
so
as
to
be
not
only
for
the
advantage
of
the
reader
,
but
also
of
the
author
,
whose
distress
,
in
this
matter
,
is
truly
pitiable
:
 
<EOS>
For
,
if
he
begins
a
digression
,
 
from
that
moment
,
I
observe
,
his
whole
work
stands
stock
still
;
 
and
if
he
goes
on
with
his
main
work
,
 
then
there
is
an
end
of
his
digression
.
    
<EOS>
This
is
vile
work
.
 
<EOS>
For
which
reason
,
from
the
beginning
of
this
,
you
see
,
I
have
constructed
the
main
work
and
the
adventitious
parts
of
it
with
such
intersections
,
and
have
so
complicated
and
involved
the
digressive
and
progressive
movements
,
one
wheel
within
another
,
that
the
whole
machine
,
in
general
,
has
been
kept
a
-
going
;
 
and
,
what
's
more
,
it
shall
be
kept
a
-
going
these
forty
years
,
if
it
pleases
the
fountain
of
health
to
bless
me
so
long
with
life
and
good
spirits
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
a
strong
propensity
in
me
to
begin
this
chapter
very
nonsensically
,
and
I
will
not
balk
my
fancy
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
I
set
off
thus
:
  
<EOS>
If
the
fixture
of
Momus
's
glass
in
the
human
breast
,
according
to
the
proposed
emendation
of
that
arch
-
critick
,
had
taken
place
,
 
first
,
This
foolish
consequence
would
certainly
have
followed
,
 
That
the
very
wisest
and
very
gravest
of
us
all
,
in
one
coin
or
other
,
must
have
paid
window-
money
every
day
of
our
lives
.
  
<EOS>
And
,
secondly
,
that
had
the
said
glass
been
there
set
up
,
nothing
more
would
have
been
wanting
,
in
order
to
have
taken
a
man
's
character
,
but
to
have
taken
a
chair
and
gone
softly
,
as
you
would
to
a
dioptrical
bee
-
hive
,
and
look'd
<EOS>
in
,
 
view'd
<EOS>
the
soul
stark
naked
;
 
observed
all
her
motions
,
  
her
machinations
;
 
traced
all
her
maggots
from
their
first
engendering
to
their
crawling
forth
;
 
watched
her
loose
in
her
frisks
,
her
gambols
,
her
capricios
;
and
after
some
notice
of
her
more
solemn
deportment
,
consequent
upon
such
frisks
,
&
c.
 
then
taken
your
pen
and
ink
and
set
down
nothing
<EOS>
but
what
you
had
seen
,
and
could
have
sworn
to
:
 
<EOS>
But
this
is
an
advantage
not
to
be
had
by
the
biographer
in
this
planet
;
 
in
the
planet
Mercury
(
belike
)
<EOS>
it
may
be
so
,
if
not
better
still
for
him
;
 
for
there
the
intense
heat
of
the
country
,
which
is
proved
by
computators
,
from
its
vicinity
to
the
sun
,
to
be
more
than
equal
to
that
of
red
-
hot
iron
,
 
<EOS>
must
,
I
think
,
long
ago
have
vitrified
the
bodies
of
the
inhabitants
,
(
as
the
efficient
cause
)
to
suit
them
for
the
climate
(
which
is
the
final
cause
;
)
so
that
betwixt
them
both
,
all
the
tenements
of
their
souls
,
from
top
to
bottom
,
may
be
nothing
else
,
for
aught
the
soundest
philosophy
can
shew
to
the
contrary
,
but
one
fine
transparent
body
of
clear
glass
(
bating
the
umbilical
knot
)
 
so
that
,
till
the
inhabitants
grow
old
and
tolerably
wrinkled
,
whereby
the
rays
of
light
,
in
passing
through
them
,
become
so
monstrously
refracted
,
 
or
return
reflected
from
their
surfaces
in
such
transverse
lines
to
the
eye
,
that
a
man
can
not
be
seen
through
;
 
his
soul
might
as
well
,
unless
for
mere
ceremony
,
or
the
trifling
advantage
which
the
umbilical
point
gave
her
,
  
might
,
upon
all
other
accounts
,
I
say
,
as
well
play
the
fool
out
o'doors
as
in
her
own
house
.
  
<EOS>
But
this
,
as
I
said
above
,
is
not
the
case
of
the
inhabitants
of
this
earth
;
 
our
minds
shine
not
through
the
body
,
but
are
wrapt
up
here
in
a
dark
covering
of
uncrystalized
flesh
and
blood
;
so
that
,
if
we
would
come
to
the
specific
characters
of
them
,
we
must
go
some
other
way
to
work
.
  
<EOS>
Many
,
in
good
truth
,
are
the
ways
,
which
human
wit
has
been
forced
to
take
,
to
do
this
thing
with
exactness
.
  
<EOS>
Some
,
for
instance
,
draw
all
their
characters
with
wind
-
instruments
.
  
<EOS>
Virgil
takes
notice
of
that
way
in
the
affair
of
Dido
and
Aeneas
;
 
but
it
is
as
fallacious
as
the
breath
of
fame
;
 
and
,
moreover
,
bespeaks
a
narrow
genius
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
ignorant
that
the
Italians
pretend
to
a
mathematical
exactness
in
their
designations
of
one
particular
sort
of
character
among
them
,
from
the
forte
or
piano
of
a
certain
wind
-
instrument
they
use
,
 
which
they
say
is
infallible
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
not
mention
the
name
of
the
instrument
in
this
place
;
 
'
tis
sufficient
<EOS>
we
have
it
amongst
us
,
 
but
never
think
of
making
a
drawing
by
it
;
 
this
is
aenigmatical
,
and
intended
to
be
so
,
at
least
ad
populum
:
 
<EOS>
And
therefore
,
I
beg
,
<EOS>
Madam
,
when
you
come
here
,
that
you
read
on
as
fast
as
you
can
,
and
never
stop
to
make
any
inquiry
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
There
are
others
again
,
who
will
draw
a
man
's
character
from
no
other
helps
in
the
world
,
but
merely
from
his
evacuations
;
 
but
this
often
gives
a
very
incorrect
outline
,
 
unless
,
indeed
,
you
take
a
sketch
of
his
repletions
too
;
and
by
correcting
one
drawing
from
the
other
,
compound
one
good
figure
out
of
them
both
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
have
no
objection
to
this
method
,
but
that
I
think
it
must
smell
too
strong
of
the
lamp
,
 
and
be
render'd
still
more
operose
,
by
forcing
you
to
have
an
eye
to
the
rest
of
his
Non
-
naturals
.
 
<EOS>
Why
the
most
natural
actions
of
a
man
's
life
should
be
called
his
Non
-
naturals
,
 
is
another
question
.
  
<EOS>
There
are
others
,
fourthly
,
who
disdain
every
one
of
these
expedients
;
 
not
from
any
fertility
of
their
own
,
but
from
the
various
ways
of
doing
it
,
which
they
have
borrowed
from
the
honourable
devices
which
the
Pentagraphic
Brethren
(
Pentagraph
,
an
instrument
to
copy
Prints
and
Pictures
mechanically
,
and
in
any
proportion
.
)
<EOS>
of
the
brush
have
shewn
in
taking
copies
.
 
<EOS>
These
,
you
must
know
,
are
your
great
historians
.
  
<EOS>
One
of
these
you
will
see
drawing
a
full
length
character
against
the
light
;
 
that
's
illiberal
,
 
dishonest
,
 
and
hard
upon
the
character
of
the
man
who
sits
.
  
<EOS>
Others
,
to
mend
the
matter
,
will
make
a
drawing
of
you
in
the
Camera
;
 
that
is
most
unfair
of
all
,
because
,
there
you
are
sure
to
be
represented
in
some
of
your
most
ridiculous
attitudes
.
  
<EOS>
To
avoid
all
and
every
one
of
these
errors
in
giving
you
my
uncle
Toby
's
character
,
I
am
determined
to
draw
it
by
no
mechanical
help
<EOS>
whatever
;
 
nor
shall
my
pencil
be
guided
by
any
one
wind
-
instrument
which
ever
was
blown
upon
,
either
on
this
,
or
on
the
other
side
of
the
Alps
;
 
nor
will
I
consider
either
his
repletions
or
his
discharges
,
 
or
touch
upon
his
Non-
naturals
;
but
,
in
a
word
,
I
will
draw
my
uncle
Toby
's
character
from
his
Hobby
-
Horse
.
    
<EOS>
If
I
was
not
morally
sure
that
the
reader
must
be
out
of
all
patience
for
my
uncle
Toby
's
character
,
 
I
would
here
previously
have
convinced
him
that
there
is
no
instrument
so
fit
to
draw
such
a
thing
with
,
as
that
which
I
have
pitch'd
upon
.
  
<EOS>
A
man
and
his
Hobby
-
Horse
,
tho
'
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
they
act
and
re
-
act
exactly
after
the
same
manner
in
which
the
soul
and
body
do
upon
each
other
:
 
<EOS>
Yet
doubtless
there
is
a
communication
between
them
of
some
kind
;
and
my
opinion
rather
is
,
that
there
is
something
in
it
more
of
the
manner
of
electrified
bodies
,
 
and
that
,
by
means
of
the
heated
parts
of
the
rider
,
which
come
immediately
into
contact
with
the
back
of
the
Hobby-
Horse
,
 
by
long
journies
and
much
friction
,
it
so
happens
,
that
the
body
of
the
rider
is
at
<EOS>
length
fill'd
as
full
of
Hobby
-
Horsical
matter
as
it
can
hold
;
 
so
that
if
you
are
able
to
give
but
a
clear
description
of
the
nature
of
the
one
,
you
may
form
a
pretty
exact
notion
of
the
genius
and
character
of
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
Now
the
Hobby
-
Horse
which
my
uncle
Toby
always
rode
upon
,
was
in
my
opinion
an
Hobby
-
Horse
<EOS>
well
worth
giving
a
description
of
,
if
it
was
only
upon
the
score
of
his
great
singularity
;
 
for
you
might
have
travelled
from
York
to
Dover
,
 
from
Dover
to
Penzance
in
Cornwall
,
and
from
Penzance
to
York
back
again
,
and
not
have
seen
such
another
upon
the
road
;
or
if
you
had
seen
such
a
one
,
whatever
haste
you
had
been
in
,
you
must
infallibly
have
stopp'd
to
have
taken
a
view
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
gait
and
figure
of
him
was
so
strange
,
and
<EOS>
so
utterly
unlike
was
he
,
from
his
head
to
his
tail
,
to
any
one
of
the
whole
species
,
that
it
was
now
and
then
made
a
matter
of
dispute
,
 
whether
he
was
really
a
Hobby
-
Horse
or
no
:
 
<EOS>
But
as
the
Philosopher
would
use
no
other
argument
to
the
Sceptic
,
who
disputed
with
him
against
the
reality
of
motion
,
save
that
of
rising
up
upon
his
legs
,
and
walking
across
the
room
;
 
so
would
my
uncle
Toby
use
no
other
argument
to
prove
his
Hobby
-
Horse
was
a
Hobby
-
Horse
indeed
,
but
by
getting
upon
his
back
and
riding
him
about
;
 
leaving
the
world
,
after
that
,
to
determine
the
point
as
it
thought
fit
.
  
<EOS>
In
good
truth
,
my
uncle
Toby
mounted
him
with
so
much
pleasure
,
and
he
carried
my
uncle
Toby
<EOS>
so
well
,
 
that
he
troubled
his
head
very
little
with
what
the
world
either
said
or
thought
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
now
high
time
,
however
,
that
I
give
you
a
description
of
him
:
 
<EOS>
But
to
go
on
regularly
,
I
only
beg
you
will
give
me
leave
to
acquaint
you
first
,
<EOS>
how
my
uncle
Toby
came
by
him
.
    
<EOS>
The
wound
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
groin
,
which
he
received
at
the
siege
of
Namur
,
rendering
him
unfit
for
the
service
<EOS>
,
it
was
thought
expedient
he
should
return
to
England
,
in
order
,
if
possible
,
to
be
set
to
rights
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
four
years
totally
confined
,
 
part
of
it
to
his
bed
,
and
all
of
it
to
his
room
:
 
and
in
the
course
of
his
cure
,
which
was
all
that
time
in
hand
,
suffer'd
unspeakable
miseries
,
 
owing
to
a
succession
of
exfoliations
from
the
os
pubis
,
and
the
outward
edge
of
that
part
of
the
coxendix
called
the
os
illium
,
 
both
which
bones
were
dismally
crush'd
,
as
much
by
the
irregularity
of
the
stone
,
which
I
told
you
was
broke
off
the
parapet
,
 
as
by
its
size
,
 
<EOS>
(
tho
'
<EOS>
it
was
pretty
large
)
which
inclined
the
surgeon
all
along
to
think
,
that
the
great
injury
which
it
had
done
my
uncle
Toby
's
groin
,
was
more
owing
to
the
gravity
of
the
stone
itself
,
than
to
the
projectile
force
of
it
,
 
which
he
would
often
tell
him
was
a
great
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
at
that
time
was
just
beginning
business
in
London
,
and
had
taken
a
house
;
 
and
as
the
truest
friendship
and
cordiality
subsisted
between
the
two
brothers
,
 
and
that
my
father
thought
my
uncle
Toby
could
no
where
be
so
well
nursed
and
taken
care
of
as
in
his
own
house
,
 
he
assign'd
<EOS>
him
the
very
best
apartment
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
what
was
a
much
more
sincere
mark
of
his
affection
still
<EOS>
,
he
would
never
suffer
a
friend
or
an
acquaintance
to
step
into
the
house
on
any
occasion
,
but
he
would
take
him
by
the
hand
,
and
lead
him
up
stairs
to
see
his
brother
Toby
,
and
chat
an
hour
by
his
bed
-
side
.
  
<EOS>
The
history
of
a
soldier
's
wound
beguiles
the
pain
of
it
;
 
my
uncle
's
visitors
at
least
thought
so
,
and
in
their
daily
calls
upon
him
,
from
the
courtesy
arising
out
of
that
belief
,
they
would
frequently
turn
the
discourse
to
that
subject
,
 
and
from
that
subject
the
discourse
would
generally
roll
on
to
the
siege
itself
.
  
<EOS>
These
conversations
were
infinitely
kind
;
and
my
uncle
Toby
received
great
relief
from
them
,
and
would
have
received
much
more
,
but
that
they
brought
him
into
some
unforeseen
perplexities
,
which
,
for
three
months
together
,
retarded
his
cure
greatly
;
and
if
he
had
not
hit
upon
an
expedient
to
extricate
himself
out
of
them
,
I
verily
believe
they
would
have
laid
him
in
his
grave
.
  
<EOS>
What
these
perplexities
of
my
uncle
Toby
were
,
 
'
tis
impossible
for
you
to
guess
;
 
if
you
could
,
 
I
should
blush
;
not
as
a
relation
,
 
not
as
a
man
,
  
nor
even
as
a
woman
,
 
<EOS>
but
I
should
blush
as
an
author
;
<EOS>
inasmuch
as
I
set
no
small
store
by
myself
upon
this
very
account
,
that
my
reader
has
never
yet
been
able
to
guess
at
any
thing
.
 
<EOS>
And
in
this
,
Sir
,
I
am
of
so
nice
and
singular
a
humour
,
that
if
I
thought
you
was
able
to
form
the
least
judgment
or
probable
conjecture
to
yourself
,
of
what
was
to
come
in
the
next
page
,
 
I
would
tear
it
out
of
my
book
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
begun
a
new
book
,
on
purpose
that
I
might
have
room
enough
to
explain
the
nature
of
the
perplexities
in
which
my
uncle
Toby
was
involved
,
from
the
many
discourses
and
interrogations
about
the
siege
of
Namur
,
where
he
received
his
wound
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
remind
the
reader
,
in
case
he
has
read
the
history
of
King
William
's
wars
,
 
but
if
he
has
not
,
 
I
then
inform
him
,
that
one
of
the
most
memorable
attacks
in
that
siege
,
was
that
which
was
made
by
the
English
and
Dutch
upon
the
point
of
the
advanced
counterscarp
,
between
the
gate
of
St.
Nicolas
,
which
inclosed
the
great
sluice
or
water
-
stop
,
where
the
English
were
terribly
exposed
to
the
shot
of
the
counter
-
guard
and
demi
-
bastion
of
St.
Roch
:
 
<EOS>
The
issue
of
which
hot
dispute
,
in
three
words
,
was
this
;
 
That
the
Dutch
lodged
themselves
upon
the
counter
-
guard
,
 
and
that
the
English
made
themselves
masters
of
the
covered
-
way
before
St.
Nicolas
-
gate
,
notwithstanding
the
gallantry
of
the
French
officers
,
who
exposed
themselves
upon
the
glacis
sword
in
hand
.
  
<EOS>
As
this
was
the
principal
attack
of
which
my
uncle
Toby
was
an
eye
-
witness
at
Namur
,
 
the
army
of
the
besiegers
being
cut
off
,
by
the
confluence
of
the
Maes
and
Sambre
,
from
seeing
much
of
each
other
's
operations
,
 
my
uncle
Toby
was
generally
more
eloquent
and
particular
in
his
account
of
it
;
and
the
many
perplexities
he
was
in
,
arose
out
of
the
almost
insurmountable
difficulties
he
found
in
telling
his
story
intelligibly
,
and
giving
such
clear
ideas
of
the
differences
and
distinctions
between
the
scarp
and
counterscarp
,
 
the
glacis
and
covered
-
way
,
 
the
half
-
moon
and
ravelin
,
 
as
to
make
his
company
fully
comprehend
where
and
what
he
was
about
.
  
<EOS>
Writers
themselves
are
too
apt
to
confound
these
terms
;
so
that
you
will
the
less
wonder
,
if
in
his
endeavours
to
explain
them
,
and
in
opposition
to
many
misconceptions
,
that
my
uncle
Toby
did
oft
-
times
puzzle
his
visitors
,
and
sometimes
himself
too
.
  
<EOS>
To
speak
the
truth
,
unless
the
company
my
father
led
up
stairs
were
tolerably
clear
-
headed
,
or
my
uncle
Toby
was
in
one
of
his
explanatory
moods
,
'
twas
a
difficult
thing
,
do
what
he
could
,
to
keep
the
discourse
free
from
obscurity
.
  
<EOS>
What
rendered
the
account
of
this
affair
the
more
intricate
to
my
uncle
Toby
,
was
this
,
 
that
in
the
attack
of
the
counterscarp
,
before
the
gate
of
St.
Nicolas
,
extending
itself
from
the
bank
of
the
Maes
,
quite
up
to
the
great
water
-
stop
,
 
the
ground
was
cut
and
cross
cut
with
such
a
multitude
of
dykes
,
drains
,
rivulets
,
and
sluices
,
on
all
sides
,
 
and
he
would
get
so
sadly
bewildered
,
and
set
fast
amongst
them
,
that
frequently
he
could
neither
get
backwards
or
forwards
to
save
his
life
;
and
was
oft
-
times
obliged
to
give
up
the
attack
upon
that
very
account
only
.
   
<EOS>
These
perplexing
rebuffs
gave
my
uncle
Toby
Shandy
more
perturbations
than
you
would
imagine
;
and
as
my
father
's
kindness
to
him
was
continually
dragging
up
fresh
friends
and
fresh
enquirers
,
 
he
had
but
a
very
uneasy
task
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
No
doubt
my
uncle
Toby
had
great
command
of
himself
,
 
and
could
guard
appearances
,
I
believe
,
as
well
as
most
men
;
 
yet
any
one
may
imagine
,
that
when
he
could
not
retreat
out
of
the
ravelin
without
getting
into
the
half-
moon
,
or
get
out
of
the
covered
-
way
without
falling
down
the
counterscarp
,
nor
cross
the
dyke
without
danger
of
slipping
into
the
ditch
,
but
that
he
must
have
fretted
and
fumed
inwardly
:
 
He
did
so
;
 
and
the
little
and
hourly
vexations
,
which
may
seem
trifling
and
of
no
account
to
the
man
who
has
not
read
Hippocrates
,
yet
,
whoever
has
read
Hippocrates
,
or
Dr.
James
Mackenzie
,
and
has
considered
well
the
effects
which
the
passions
and
affections
of
the
mind
have
upon
the
digestion
 
<EOS>
(
Why
not
of
a
wound
as
well
as
of
a
dinner
?
)
 
<EOS>
may
easily
conceive
what
sharp
paroxysms
and
exacerbations
of
his
wound
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
must
have
undergone
upon
that
score
only
.
    
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
could
not
philosophize
upon
it
;
 
'
<EOS>
twas
enough
<EOS>
he
felt
it
was
so
,
 
and
having
sustained
the
pain
and
sorrows
of
it
for
three
months
together
,
he
was
resolved
some
way
or
other
to
extricate
himself
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
one
morning
lying
upon
his
back
in
his
bed
,
the
anguish
and
nature
of
the
wound
upon
his
groin
suffering
him
to
lie
in
no
other
position
,
when
a
thought
came
into
his
head
,
that
if
he
could
purchase
such
a
thing
,
and
have
it
pasted
down
upon
a
board
,
as
a
large
map
of
the
fortification
of
the
town
and
citadel
of
Namur
,
with
its
environs
,
it
might
be
a
means
of
giving
him
ease
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
notice
of
his
desire
to
have
the
environs
along
with
the
town
and
citadel
,
for
this
reason
,
 
because
my
uncle
Toby
's
wound
was
got
in
one
of
the
traverses
,
about
thirty
toises
from
the
returning
angle
of
the
trench
,
opposite
to
the
salient
angle
of
the
demi
-
bastion
of
St.
Roch
:
 
so
that
he
was
pretty
confident
he
could
stick
a
pin
upon
the
identical
spot
of
ground
where
he
was
standing
on
when
the
stone
struck
him
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
succeeded
to
his
wishes
,
and
not
only
freed
him
from
a
world
of
sad
explanations
,
but
,
in
the
end
,
it
proved
the
happy
means
,
as
you
will
read
,
of
procuring
my
uncle
Toby
his
Hobby
-
Horse
.
    
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
so
foolish
,
when
you
are
at
the
expence
of
making
an
entertainment
of
this
kind
,
as
to
order
things
so
badly
,
as
to
let
your
criticks
and
gentry
of
refined
taste
run
it
down
:
 
Nor
is
there
any
thing
so
likely
to
make
them
do
it
,
as
that
of
leaving
them
out
of
the
party
,
or
,
what
is
full
as
offensive
,
of
bestowing
your
attention
upon
the
rest
of
your
guests
in
so
particular
a
way
,
as
if
there
was
no
such
thing
as
a
critick
(
by
occupation
)
at
table
.
    
<EOS>
I
guard
against
both
;
for
,
in
the
first
place
,
I
have
left
half
a
dozen
places
purposely
open
for
them
;
 
and
in
the
next
place
,
I
pay
them
all
court
.
 
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
I
kiss
your
hands
,
I
protest
no
company
could
give
me
half
the
pleasure
,
 
by
my
soul
<EOS>
I
am
glad
to
see
you
 
<EOS>
I
beg
<EOS>
only
you
will
make
no
strangers
of
yourselves
,
but
sit
down
without
any
ceremony
,
and
fall
on
heartily
.
  
<EOS>
I
said
I
had
left
six
places
,
and
I
was
upon
the
point
of
carrying
my
complaisance
so
far
,
as
to
have
left
a
seventh
open
for
them
,
 
and
in
this
very
spot
I
stand
on
;
but
being
told
by
a
Critick
(
tho
'
not
by
occupation
,
 
but
by
nature
)
that
I
had
acquitted
myself
well
enough
<EOS>
,
I
shall
fill
it
up
directly
,
hoping
,
in
the
mean
time
,
that
I
shall
be
able
to
make
a
great
deal
of
more
room
next
year
.
     
<EOS>
How
,
in
the
name
of
wonder
!
<EOS>
could
your
uncle
Toby
,
who
,
it
seems
,
was
a
military
man
,
and
whom
you
have
represented
as
no
fool
<EOS>
,
 
be
at
the
same
time
<EOS>
such
a
confused
,
pudding
-
headed
,
muddle
-
headed
,
fellow
,
as
 
Go
look
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
Sir
Critick
,
I
could
have
replied
;
but
I
scorn
it
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
language
unurbane
,
 
and
only
befitting
the
man
who
can
not
give
clear
and
satisfactory
accounts
of
things
,
or
dive
deep
enough
into
the
first
causes
of
human
ignorance
and
confusion
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
moreover
the
reply
valiant
 
and
therefore
I
reject
it
;
for
tho
"
it
might
have
suited
my
uncle
Toby
's
character
as
a
soldier
excellently
well
,
 
and
had
he
not
accustomed
himself
,
in
such
attacks
,
to
whistle
the
Lillabullero
,
as
he
wanted
no
courage
,
'
tis
the
very
answer
he
would
have
given
;
yet
it
would
by
no
means
have
done
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
as
plain
as
can
be
,
that
I
write
as
a
man
of
erudition
;
 
that
even
my
similies
,
my
allusions
,
my
illustrations
,
my
metaphors
,
are
erudite
,
 
and
that
I
must
sustain
my
character
properly
,
and
contrast
it
properly
too
,
 
else
what
would
become
of
me
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
Sir
,
I
should
be
undone
;
 
at
this
very
moment
that
I
am
going
here
to
fill
up
one
place
against
a
critick
,
 
I
should
have
made
an
opening
for
a
couple
.
    
<EOS>
Therefore
I
answer
thus
:
  
<EOS>
Pray
,
Sir
,
in
all
the
reading
which
you
have
ever
read
,
did
you
ever
read
such
a
book
as
Locke
's
Essay
upon
the
Human
Understanding
?
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
answer
me
rashly
 
because
many
,
I
know
,
quote
the
book
,
who
have
not
read
it
 
and
many
have
read
it
who
understand
it
not
:
 
<EOS>
If
either
of
these
is
your
case
,
as
I
write
to
instruct
,
I
will
tell
you
in
three
words
what
the
book
is
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
a
history
.
 
<EOS>
A
history
!
<EOS>
of
who
?
<EOS>
what
?
<EOS>
where
?
<EOS>
when
?
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
hurry
yourself
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
history
-
book
,
Sir
,
(
which
may
possibly
recommend
it
to
the
world
)
of
what
passes
in
a
man
's
own
mind
;
and
if
you
will
say
so
much
of
the
book
,
and
no
more
,
believe
me
,
you
will
cut
no
contemptible
figure
in
a
metaphysick
circle
.
  
<EOS>
But
this
by
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
Now
if
you
will
venture
to
go
along
with
me
,
and
look
down
into
the
bottom
of
this
matter
,
it
will
be
found
that
the
cause
of
obscurity
and
confusion
,
in
the
mind
of
a
man
,
is
threefold
.
  
<EOS>
Dull
organs
,
dear
Sir
,
in
the
first
place
.
 
<EOS>
Secondly
,
slight
and
transient
impressions
made
by
the
objects
,
when
the
said
organs
are
not
dull
.
 
<EOS>
And
thirdly
,
a
memory
like
unto
a
sieve
,
not
able
to
retain
what
it
has
received
.
 
<EOS>
Call
down
Dolly
your
chamber
-
maid
,
and
I
will
give
you
my
cap
and
bell
along
with
it
,
if
I
make
not
this
matter
so
plain
that
Dolly
herself
should
understand
it
as
well
as
Malbranch
.
 
<EOS>
When
Dolly
has
indited
her
epistle
to
Robin
,
and
has
thrust
her
arm
into
the
bottom
of
her
pocket
hanging
by
her
right
side
;
 
take
that
opportunity
to
recollect
that
the
organs
and
faculties
of
perception
can
,
by
nothing
in
this
world
,
be
so
aptly
typified
and
explained
as
by
that
one
thing
which
Dolly
's
hand
is
in
search
of
.
 
<EOS>
Your
organs
are
not
so
dull
that
I
should
inform
you
 
'
tis
an
inch
,
Sir
,
of
red
seal
-
wax
.
  
<EOS>
When
this
is
melted
and
dropped
upon
the
letter
,
if
Dolly
fumbles
too
long
for
her
thimble
,
till
the
wax
is
over
hardened
,
it
will
not
receive
the
mark
of
her
thimble
from
the
usual
impulse
which
was
wo
nt
to
imprint
it
.
 
<EOS>
Very
well
.
 
<EOS>
If
Dolly
's
wax
,
for
want
of
better
,
is
bees
-
wax
,
or
of
a
temper
too
soft
,
 
tho
'
it
may
receive
,
 
it
will
not
hold
the
impression
,
how
hard
soever
Dolly
thrusts
against
it
;
and
last
of
all
,
supposing
the
wax
good
,
and
eke
the
thimble
,
but
applied
thereto
in
careless
haste
,
as
her
Mistress
rings
the
bell
;
 
in
any
one
of
these
three
cases
the
print
left
by
the
thimble
will
be
as
unlike
the
prototype
as
a
brass
-
jack
.
  
<EOS>
Now
you
must
understand
that
not
one
of
these
was
the
true
cause
of
the
confusion
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
discourse
;
and
it
is
for
that
very
reason
I
enlarge
upon
them
so
long
,
after
the
manner
of
great
physiologists
 
<EOS>
to
shew
the
world
,
what
it
did
not
arise
from
.
  
<EOS>
What
it
did
arise
from
,
I
have
hinted
above
,
and
a
fertile
source
of
obscurity
it
is
,
 
and
ever
will
be
,
 
and
that
is
the
unsteady
uses
of
words
,
which
have
perplexed
the
clearest
and
most
exalted
understandings
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
ten
to
one
(
at
Arthur
's
)
whether
you
have
ever
read
the
literary
histories
of
past
ages
;
 
if
you
have
,
what
terrible
battles
,
"
yclept
logomachies
,
have
they
occasioned
and
perpetuated
with
so
much
gall
and
ink
-
shed
,
 
that
a
good
-
natured
man
can
not
read
the
accounts
of
them
without
tears
in
his
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
Gentle
critick
!
<EOS>
when
thou
hast
weighed
all
this
,
and
considered
within
thyself
how
much
of
thy
own
knowledge
,
discourse
,
and
conversation
has
been
pestered
and
disordered
,
at
one
time
or
other
,
by
this
,
and
this
only
:
  
<EOS>
What
a
pudder
and
racket
in
Councils
about
(
Greek
)
;
and
in
the
Schools
of
the
learned
about
power
and
about
spirit
;
 
about
essences
,
and
about
quintessences
;
 
about
substances
,
and
about
space
.
 
<EOS>
What
confusion
in
greater
Theatres
from
words
of
little
meaning
,
and
as
indeterminate
a
sense
!
<EOS>
when
thou
considerest
this
,
thou
wilt
not
wonder
at
my
uncle
Toby
's
perplexities
,
 
thou
wilt
drop
a
tear
of
pity
upon
his
scarp
and
his
counterscarp
;
 
his
glacis
and
his
covered
way
;
 
his
ravelin
and
his
half-
moon
:
 
'
Twas
not
by
ideas
,
 
by
Heaven
;
his
life
was
put
in
jeopardy
by
words
.
    
<EOS>
When
my
uncle
Toby
got
his
map
of
Namur
to
his
mind
,
he
began
immediately
to
apply
himself
,
and
with
the
utmost
diligence
,
to
the
study
of
it
;
for
nothing
being
of
more
importance
to
him
than
his
recovery
,
and
his
recovery
depending
,
as
you
have
read
,
upon
the
passions
and
affections
of
his
mind
,
it
behoved
him
to
take
the
nicest
care
to
make
himself
so
far
master
of
his
subject
,
as
to
be
able
to
talk
upon
it
without
emotion
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
fortnight
's
close
and
painful
application
,
which
,
by
the
bye
,
did
my
uncle
Toby
's
wound
,
upon
his
groin
,
no
good
,
 
he
was
enabled
,
by
the
help
of
some
marginal
documents
at
the
feet
of
the
elephant
,
together
with
Gobesius
's
military
architecture
and
pyroballogy
,
translated
from
the
Flemish
,
to
form
his
discourse
with
passable
perspicuity
;
and
before
he
was
two
full
months
gone
,
 
he
was
right
eloquent
upon
it
,
and
could
make
not
only
the
attack
of
the
advanced
counterscarp
with
great
order
;
 
but
having
,
by
that
time
,
gone
much
deeper
into
the
art
,
than
what
his
first
motive
made
necessary
,
my
uncle
Toby
was
able
to
cross
the
Maes
and
Sambre
;
make
diversions
as
far
as
Vauban
's
line
,
the
abbey
of
Salsines
,
&
c.
and
give
his
visitors
as
distinct
a
history
of
each
of
their
attacks
,
as
of
that
of
the
gate
of
St.
Nicolas
,
where
he
had
the
honour
to
receive
his
wound
.
  
<EOS>
But
desire
of
knowledge
,
like
the
thirst
of
riches
,
increases
ever
with
the
acquisition
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
more
my
uncle
Toby
pored
over
his
map
,
the
more
he
took
a
liking
to
it
!
 
<EOS>
by
the
same
process
and
electrical
assimilation
,
as
I
told
you
,
through
which
I
ween
the
souls
of
connoisseurs
themselves
,
by
long
friction
and
incumbition
,
have
the
happiness
,
at
length
,
to
get
all
be
-
virtu'd
 
be
-
pictured
,
 
be
-
butterflied
,
and
be
-
fiddled
.
  
<EOS>
The
more
my
uncle
Toby
drank
of
this
sweet
fountain
of
science
<EOS>
,
the
greater
was
the
heat
and
impatience
of
his
thirst
,
so
that
before
the
first
year
of
his
confinement
had
well
gone
round
,
there
was
scarce
a
fortified
town
in
Italy
or
Flanders
,
of
which
,
by
one
means
or
other
,
he
had
not
procured
a
plan
,
reading
over
as
he
got
them
,
and
carefully
collating
therewith
the
histories
of
their
sieges
,
their
demolitions
,
their
improvements
,
and
new
works
,
all
which
he
would
read
with
that
intense
application
and
delight
,
that
he
would
forget
himself
,
his
wound
,
his
confinement
,
his
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
second
year
my
uncle
Toby
purchased
Ramelli
and
Cataneo
,
translated
from
the
Italian
;
 
likewise
Stevinus
,
Moralis
,
the
Chevalier
de
Ville
,
Lorini
,
Cochorn
,
Sheeter
,
the
Count
de
Pagan
,
the
Marshal
Vauban
,
Mons
.
<EOS>
Blondel
,
with
almost
as
many
more
books
of
military
architecture
,
as
Don
Quixote
was
found
to
have
of
chivalry
,
when
the
curate
and
barber
invaded
his
library
.
  
<EOS>
Towards
the
beginning
of
the
third
year
,
which
was
in
August
,
ninety
-
nine
,
my
uncle
Toby
found
it
necessary
to
understand
a
little
of
projectiles
:
  
and
having
judged
it
best
to
draw
his
knowledge
from
the
fountain
-
head
,
he
began
with
N.
Tartaglia
,
who
it
seems
was
the
first
man
who
detected
the
imposition
of
a
cannon
-
ball
's
doing
all
that
mischief
under
the
notion
of
a
right
line
 
<EOS>
This
N.
Tartaglia
proved
to
my
uncle
Toby
to
be
an
impossible
thing
.
    
<EOS>
Endless
is
the
search
of
Truth
.
  
<EOS>
No
sooner
was
my
uncle
Toby
satisfied
which
road
the
cannon
-
ball
did
not
go
,
but
he
was
insensibly
led
on
,
and
resolved
in
his
mind
to
enquire
and
find
out
which
road
the
ball
did
go
:
 
For
which
purpose
he
was
obliged
to
set
off
afresh
with
old
Maltus
,
and
studied
him
devoutly
.
 
<EOS>
He
proceeded
next
to
Galileo
and
Torricellius
,
wherein
,
by
certain
Geometrical
rules
,
infallibly
laid
down
,
he
found
the
precise
path
to
be
a
Parabola
 
or
else
an
Hyperbola
,
 
and
that
the
parameter
,
or
latus
rectum
,
of
the
conic
section
of
the
said
path
,
was
to
the
quantity
and
amplitude
in
a
direct
ratio
,
as
the
whole
line
to
the
sine
of
double
the
angle
of
incidence
,
formed
by
the
breech
upon
an
horizontal
plane
;
 
and
that
the
semiparameter
,
 
stop
!
<EOS>
my
dear
uncle
Toby
 
stop
!
 
<EOS>
go
not
one
foot
farther
into
this
thorny
and
bewildered
track
,
 
intricate
<EOS>
are
the
steps
!
<EOS>
intricate
are
the
mazes
of
this
labyrinth
!
<EOS>
intricate
are
the
troubles
which
the
pursuit
of
this
bewitching
phantom
Knowledge
will
bring
upon
thee
.
 
<EOS>
O
my
uncle
;
 
fly
 
fly
,
 
fly
from
it
as
from
a
serpent
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
fit
 
goodnatured
man
!
<EOS>
thou
should'st
sit
up
,
with
the
wound
upon
thy
groin
,
whole
nights
baking
thy
blood
with
hectic
watchings
?
 
<EOS>
Alas
!
'
<EOS>
twill
exasperate
thy
symptoms
,
 
check
thy
perspirations
 
evaporate
thy
spirits
 
<EOS>
waste
thy
animal
strength
,
dry
up
thy
radical
moisture
,
bring
thee
into
a
costive
habit
of
body
,
 
impair
thy
health
,
 
and
hasten
all
the
infirmities
of
thy
old
age
.
  
<EOS>
O
my
uncle
!
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
.
    
<EOS>
I
would
not
give
a
groat
for
that
man
's
knowledge
in
pen
-
craft
,
who
does
not
understand
this
,
 
That
the
best
plain
narrative
in
the
world
,
tacked
very
close
to
the
last
spirited
apostrophe
to
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
 
would
have
felt
both
cold
and
vapid
upon
the
reader
's
palate
;
 
therefore
I
forthwith
put
an
end
to
the
chapter
,
though
I
was
in
the
middle
of
my
story
.
    
<EOS>
Writers
of
my
stamp
have
one
principle
in
common
with
painters
.
 
<EOS>
Where
an
exact
copying
makes
our
pictures
less
striking
,
we
choose
the
less
evil
;
deeming
it
even
more
pardonable
to
trespass
against
truth
,
than
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
to
be
understood
cum
grano
salis
;
but
be
it
as
it
will
,
 
as
the
parallel
is
made
more
for
the
sake
of
letting
the
apostrophe
cool
,
than
any
thing
else
,
 
<EOS>
'
tis
not
very
material
whether
upon
any
other
score
the
reader
approves
of
it
or
not
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
latter
end
of
the
third
year
,
my
uncle
Toby
perceiving
that
the
parameter
and
semi
-
parameter
of
the
conic
section
angered
his
wound
,
he
left
off
the
study
of
projectiles
in
a
kind
of
a
huff
,
and
betook
himself
to
the
practical
part
of
fortification
only
;
the
pleasure
of
which
,
like
a
spring
held
back
,
returned
upon
him
with
redoubled
force
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
in
this
year
that
my
uncle
began
to
break
in
upon
the
daily
regularity
of
a
clean
shirt
,
 
to
dismiss
his
barber
unshaven
,
 
and
to
allow
his
surgeon
scarce
time
sufficient
to
dress
his
wound
,
concerning
himself
so
little
about
it
,
as
not
to
ask
him
once
in
seven
times
dressing
<EOS>
,
how
it
went
on
:
 
<EOS>
when
,
lo
!
 
<EOS>
all
of
a
sudden
,
for
the
change
was
quick
as
lightning
,
he
began
to
sigh
heavily
for
his
recovery
,
 
complained
to
my
father
,
grew
impatient
with
the
surgeon
:
 
and
one
morning
,
as
he
heard
his
foot
coming
up
stairs
,
he
shut
up
his
books
,
and
thrust
aside
his
instruments
,
in
order
to
expostulate
with
him
upon
the
protraction
of
the
cure
,
which
,
he
told
him
,
might
surely
have
been
accomplished
at
least
by
that
time
:
 
<EOS>
He
dwelt
long
upon
the
miseries
he
had
undergone
,
and
the
sorrows
of
his
four
years
melancholy
imprisonment
;
 
adding
,
that
had
it
not
been
for
the
kind
looks
and
fraternal
chearings
of
the
best
of
brothers
,
  
he
had
long
since
sunk
under
his
misfortunes
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
was
by
.
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
's
eloquence
brought
tears
into
his
eyes
;
 
'
twas
unexpected
:
 
My
uncle
Toby
,
by
nature
was
not
eloquent
;
 
it
had
the
greater
effect
:
 
<EOS>
The
surgeon
was
confounded
;
 
not
that
there
wanted
grounds
for
such
,
or
greater
marks
of
impatience
,
 
but
'
twas
unexpected
too
;
in
the
four
years
he
had
attended
him
,
he
had
never
seen
any
thing
like
it
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
carriage
;
he
had
never
once
dropped
one
fretful
or
discontented
word
;
 
he
had
been
all
patience
,
 
all
submission
.
    
<EOS>
We
lose
the
right
of
complaining
sometimes
by
forbearing
it
;
 
but
we
often
treble
the
force
:
 
<EOS>
The
surgeon
was
astonished
;
but
much
more
so
,
when
he
heard
my
uncle
Toby
go
on
,
and
peremptorily
insist
upon
his
healing
up
the
wound
directly
,
 
or
sending
for
Monsieur
Ronjat
,
the
king
's
serjeant-
surgeon
,
to
do
it
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
desire
of
life
and
health
is
implanted
in
man
's
nature
;
 
the
love
of
liberty
and
enlargement
is
a
sister
-
passion
to
it
:
 
<EOS>
These
my
uncle
Toby
had
in
common
with
his
species
 
and
either
of
them
had
been
sufficient
to
account
for
his
earnest
desire
to
get
well
and
out
of
doors
;
 
but
I
have
told
you
before
,
that
nothing
wrought
with
our
family
after
the
common
way
;
 
and
from
the
time
and
manner
in
which
this
eager
desire
shewed
itself
in
the
present
case
,
the
penetrating
reader
will
suspect
there
was
some
other
cause
or
crotchet
for
it
in
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
's
head
:
 
<EOS>
There
was
so
,
and
'
tis
the
subject
of
the
next
chapter
to
set
forth
what
that
cause
and
crotchet
was
.
 
<EOS>
I
own
,
when
that
's
done
,
'
twill
be
time
to
return
back
to
the
parlour
fire
-
side
,
where
we
left
my
uncle
Toby
in
the
middle
of
his
sentence
.
    
<EOS>
When
a
man
gives
himself
up
to
the
government
of
a
ruling
passion
,
 
or
,
in
other
words
,
when
his
Hobby
-
Horse
grows
headstrong
,
 
farewell
cool
reason
and
fair
discretion
!
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
's
wound
was
near
well
,
and
as
soon
as
the
surgeon
recovered
his
surprize
,
and
could
get
leave
to
say
as
much
 
<EOS>
he
told
him
,
'
twas
just
beginning
to
incarnate
;
and
that
if
no
fresh
exfoliation
happened
,
which
there
was
no
sign
of
,
 
it
would
be
dried
up
in
five
or
six
weeks
.
 
<EOS>
The
sound
of
as
many
Olympiads
,
twelve
hours
before
,
would
have
conveyed
an
idea
of
shorter
duration
to
my
uncle
Toby
's
mind
.
 
<EOS>
The
succession
of
his
ideas
was
now
rapid
,
 
he
broiled
with
impatience
to
put
his
design
in
execution
;
 
and
so
,
without
consulting
farther
with
any
soul
living
,
  
which
,
by
the
bye
,
I
think
is
right
,
when
you
are
predetermined
to
take
no
one
soul
's
advice
,
 
he
privately
ordered
Trim
,
his
man
,
to
pack
up
a
bundle
of
lint
and
dressings
,
and
hire
a
chariot
-
and
-
four
to
be
at
the
door
exactly
by
twelve
o'clock
that
day
,
when
he
knew
my
father
would
be
upon
"
Change
.
 
<EOS>
So
leaving
a
bank
-
note
upon
the
table
for
the
surgeon
's
care
of
him
,
and
a
letter
of
tender
thanks
for
his
brother
's
 
he
packed
up
his
maps
,
his
books
of
fortification
,
his
instruments
,
&
c.
and
by
the
help
of
a
crutch
on
one
side
,
and
Trim
on
the
other
,
 
my
uncle
Toby
embarked
for
Shandy
-
Hall
.
  
<EOS>
The
reason
,
or
rather
the
rise
of
this
sudden
demigration
was
as
follows
:
  
<EOS>
The
table
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
room
,
and
at
which
,
the
night
before
this
change
happened
,
he
was
sitting
with
his
maps
,
&
c.
about
him
 
being
somewhat
of
the
smallest
,
for
that
infinity
of
great
and
small
instruments
of
knowledge
which
usually
lay
crowded
upon
it
 
<EOS>
he
had
the
accident
,
in
reaching
over
for
his
tobacco
-
box
,
to
throw
down
his
compasses
,
and
in
stooping
to
take
the
compasses
up
,
with
his
sleeve
he
threw
down
his
case
of
instruments
and
snuffers
;
 
and
<EOS>
as
the
dice
took
a
run
against
him
,
in
his
endeavouring
to
catch
the
snuffers
in
falling
,
 
he
thrust
Monsieur
Blondel
off
the
table
,
and
Count
de
Pagon
o'top
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Twas
to
no
purpose
for
a
man
<EOS>
,
lame
as
my
uncle
Toby
was
,
to
think
of
redressing
these
evils
by
himself
,
 
he
rung
his
bell
for
his
man
Trim
;
  
Trim
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
prithee
see
what
confusion
I
have
here
been
making
 
<EOS>
I
must
have
some
better
contrivance
,
Trim
.
 
<EOS>
Can'st
<EOS>
not
thou
take
my
rule
,
and
measure
the
length
and
breadth
of
this
table
,
and
then
go
and
bespeak
me
one
as
big
again
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
an
'
please
your
Honour
,
replied
Trim
,
making
a
bow
;
but
I
hope
your
Honour
will
be
soon
well
enough
to
get
down
to
your
country
-
seat
,
where
,
 
as
your
Honour
takes
so
much
pleasure
in
fortification
,
we
could
manage
this
matter
to
a
T.
  
<EOS>
I
must
here
inform
you
,
that
this
servant
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
,
who
went
by
the
name
of
Trim
,
had
been
a
corporal
in
my
uncle
's
own
company
,
 
his
real
name
was
James
Butler
,
 
but
having
got
the
nick
-
name
of
Trim
,
in
the
regiment
,
my
uncle
Toby
,
unless
when
he
happened
to
be
very
angry
with
him
,
would
never
call
him
by
any
other
name
.
  
<EOS>
The
poor
fellow
had
been
disabled
for
the
service
,
by
a
wound
on
his
left
knee
by
a
musket
-
bullet
,
at
the
battle
of
Landen
,
which
was
two
years
before
the
affair
of
Namur
;
 
and
as
the
fellow
was
well
-
beloved
in
the
regiment
,
and
a
handy
fellow
into
the
bargain
,
my
uncle
Toby
took
him
for
his
servant
;
and
of
an
excellent
use
was
he
,
attending
my
uncle
Toby
in
the
camp
and
in
his
quarters
as
a
valet
,
groom
,
barber
,
cook
,
sempster
,
and
nurse
;
and
indeed
,
from
first
to
last
,
waited
upon
him
and
served
him
with
great
fidelity
and
affection
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
loved
the
man
in
return
,
and
what
attached
him
more
to
him
still
,
was
the
similitude
of
their
knowledge
.
 
<EOS>
For
Corporal
Trim
,
(
for
so
,
for
the
future
,
I
shall
call
him
)
by
four
years
occasional
attention
to
his
Master
's
discourse
upon
fortified
towns
,
and
the
advantage
of
prying
and
peeping
continually
into
his
Master
's
plans
,
&
c.
exclusive
and
besides
what
he
gained
Hobby
-
Horsically
,
as
a
body
-
servant
,
Non
Hobby
Horsical
per
se
;
  
had
become
no
mean
proficient
in
the
science
;
and
was
thought
,
by
the
cook
and
chamber
-
maid
,
to
know
as
much
of
the
nature
of
strong
-
holds
as
my
uncle
Toby
himself
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
<EOS>
but
one
more
stroke
to
give
to
finish
Corporal
Trim
's
character
,
  
<EOS>
and
it
is
the
only
dark
line
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
fellow
loved
to
advise
,
 
or
rather
to
hear
himself
talk
;
his
carriage
,
however
,
was
so
perfectly
respectful
,
'
twas
easy
to
keep
him
silent
when
you
had
him
so
;
but
set
his
tongue
a-
<EOS>
going
,
 
you
had
no
hold
of
him
 
<EOS>
he
was
voluble
;
 
the
eternal
interlardings
of
your
Honour
,
with
the
respectfulness
of
Corporal
Trim
's
manner
,
interceding
so
strong
in
behalf
of
his
elocution
,
 
that
though
you
might
have
been
incommoded
,
 
you
could
not
well
be
angry
.
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
was
seldom
either
the
one
or
the
other
with
him
,
 
or
,
at
least
,
this
fault
,
in
Trim
,
broke
no
squares
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
,
as
I
said
,
loved
the
man
;
 
and
besides
,
as
he
ever
looked
upon
a
faithful
servant
,
 
but
as
an
humble
friend
,
 
he
could
not
bear
to
stop
his
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
Such
was
Corporal
Trim
.
  
<EOS>
If
I
durst
presume
,
continued
Trim
,
to
give
your
Honour
my
advice
,
and
speak
my
opinion
in
this
matter
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
art
welcome
,
Trim
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
 
speak
<EOS>
,
 
speak
what
thou
thinkest
upon
the
subject
,
man
,
without
fear
.
 
<EOS>
Why
then
,
replied
Trim
,
(
not
hanging
his
ears
and
scratching
his
head
like
a
country
-
lout
,
but
)
stroking
his
hair
back
from
his
forehead
,
and
standing
erect
as
before
his
division
,
 
I
think
,
quoth
Trim
,
advancing
his
left
,
which
was
his
lame
leg
,
a
little
forwards
,
 
and
pointing
with
his
right
hand
open
towards
a
map
of
Dunkirk
,
which
was
pinned
against
the
hangings
<EOS>
,
 
I
think
,
quoth
Corporal
Trim
,
with
humble
submission
to
your
Honour
's
better
judgment
,
 
that
these
ravelins
,
bastions
,
curtins
,
and
hornworks
,
make
but
a
poor
,
contemptible
,
fiddle
-
faddle
piece
of
work
of
it
here
upon
paper
,
compared
to
what
your
Honour
and
I
could
make
of
it
were
we
in
the
country
by
ourselves
,
and
had
but
a
rood
,
or
a
rood
and
a
half
of
ground
to
do
what
we
pleased
with
:
 
<EOS>
As
summer
is
coming
on
,
continued
Trim
,
your
Honour
might
sit
out
of
doors
,
and
give
me
the
nography
 
<EOS>
(
Call
it
ichnography
,
quoth
my
uncle
,
)
 
of
the
town
or
citadel
,
your
Honour
was
pleased
to
sit
down
before
,
 
and
I
will
be
shot
by
your
Honour
upon
the
glacis
of
it
,
if
I
did
not
fortify
it
to
your
Honour
's
mind
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
thou
would'st
,
Trim
,
quoth
my
uncle
.
 
<EOS>
For
if
your
Honour
,
continued
the
Corporal
,
could
but
mark
me
the
polygon
,
with
its
exact
lines
and
angles
  
That
I
could
do
very
well
,
quoth
my
uncle
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
begin
with
the
fosse
,
and
if
your
Honour
could
tell
me
the
proper
depth
and
breadth
 
I
can
to
a
hair
's
breadth
,
Trim
,
replied
my
uncle
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
throw
out
the
earth
upon
this
hand
towards
the
town
for
the
scarp
,
 
and
on
that
hand
towards
the
campaign
for
the
counterscarp
.
 
<EOS>
Very
right
,
Trim
,
quoth
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
:
 
<EOS>
And
when
I
had
sloped
them
to
your
mind
,
 
an
'
please
your
Honour
,
I
would
face
the
glacis
,
as
the
finest
fortifications
are
done
in
Flanders
,
with
sods
,
  
and
as
your
Honour
knows
they
should
be
,
 
and
I
would
make
the
walls
and
parapets
with
sods
too
.
 
<EOS>
The
best
engineers
call
them
gazons
,
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
they
are
gazons
or
sods
,
is
not
much
matter
,
replied
Trim
;
your
Honour
knows
they
are
ten
times
beyond
a
facing
either
of
brick
or
stone
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
they
are
,
<EOS>
Trim
in
some
respects
,
 
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
nodding
his
head
;
 
for
a
cannon
-
ball
enters
into
the
gazon
right
onwards
,
without
bringing
any
rubbish
down
with
it
,
which
might
fill
the
fosse
,
(
as
was
the
case
at
St.
Nicolas
's
gate
)
and
facilitate
the
passage
over
it
.
  
<EOS>
Your
Honour
understands
these
matters
,
replied
Corporal
Trim
,
better
than
any
officer
in
his
Majesty
's
service
;
 
but
would
your
Honour
please
to
let
the
bespeaking
of
the
table
alone
,
and
let
us
but
go
into
the
country
,
I
would
work
under
your
Honour
's
directions
like
a
horse
,
and
make
fortifications
for
you
something
like
a
tansy
,
with
all
their
batteries
,
saps
,
ditches
,
and
palisadoes
,
that
it
should
be
worth
all
the
world
's
riding
twenty
miles
to
go
and
see
it
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
blushed
as
red
as
scarlet
as
Trim
went
on
;
 
but
it
was
not
a
blush
of
guilt
,
 
of
modesty
,
 
or
of
anger
,
 
it
was
a
blush
of
joy
;
 
<EOS>
he
was
fired
with
Corporal
Trim
's
project
and
description
.
 
<EOS>
Trim
!
<EOS>
said
my
uncle
Toby
<EOS>
,
thou
hast
said
enough
.
 
<EOS>
We
might
begin
the
campaign
,
continued
Trim
,
on
the
very
day
that
his
Majesty
and
the
Allies
take
the
field
,
and
demolish
them
town
by
town
as
fast
as
 
Trim
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
say
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
Your
Honour
,
continued
Trim
,
might
sit
in
your
arm
-
chair
(
pointing
to
it
)
<EOS>
this
fine
weather
,
giving
me
your
orders
,
and
<EOS>
I
would
 
Say
no
more
,
Trim
,
quoth
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
your
Honour
would
get
not
only
pleasure
and
good
pastime
 
but
good
air
,
and
good
exercise
,
and
good
health
,
 
and
your
Honour
's
wound
would
be
well
in
a
month
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
hast
said
enough
,
Trim
,
 
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
<EOS>
(
putting
his
hand
into
his
breeches
-
pocket
)
 
<EOS>
I
like
thy
project
mightily
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
your
Honour
pleases
,
I
'll
this
moment
go
and
buy
a
pioneer
's
spade
to
take
down
with
us
,
and
I
'll
bespeak
a
shovel
and
a
pick
-
axe
,
and
a
couple
of
 
Say
no
more
,
Trim
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
leaping
up
upon
one
leg
,
quite
overcome
with
rapture
,
 
and
thrusting
a
guinea
into
Trim
's
hand
,
 
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
say
no
more
;
 
but
go
down
,
Trim
,
this
moment
,
my
lad
,
and
bring
up
my
supper
this
instant
.
  
<EOS>
Trim
ran
down
and
brought
up
his
master
's
supper
,
 
to
no
purpose
:
 
Trim
's
plan
of
operation
ran
so
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
head
,
he
could
not
taste
it
.
  
<EOS>
Trim
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
get
me
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
'
Twas
all
one
.
 
<EOS>
Corporal
Trim
's
description
had
fired
his
imagination
,
 
my
uncle
Toby
could
not
shut
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
The
more
he
considered
it
,
the
more
bewitching
the
scene
appeared
to
him
;
 
so
that
,
two
full
hours
before
day
-
light
,
he
had
come
to
a
final
determination
and
had
concerted
the
whole
plan
of
his
and
Corporal
Trim
's
decampment
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
had
a
little
neat
country
-
house
of
his
own
,
in
the
village
where
my
father
's
estate
lay
at
Shandy
,
which
had
been
left
him
by
an
old
uncle
,
with
a
small
estate
of
about
one
hundred
pounds
a
-
year
.
 
<EOS>
Behind
this
house
,
and
contiguous
to
it
,
was
a
kitchen
-
garden
of
about
half
an
acre
,
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
,
and
cut
off
from
it
by
a
tall
yew
hedge
,
was
a
bowling
-
green
,
containing
just
about
as
much
ground
as
Corporal
Trim
wished
for
;
 
so
that
as
Trim
uttered
the
words
,
"
A
rood
and
a
half
of
ground
to
do
what
they
would
with
,
"
 
this
identical
bowling
-
green
instantly
presented
itself
,
and
became
curiously
painted
all
at
once
,
upon
the
retina
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
fancy
;
 
which
was
the
physical
cause
of
making
him
change
colour
,
or
at
least
of
heightening
his
blush
,
to
that
immoderate
degree
I
spoke
of
.
  
<EOS>
Never
did
lover
post
down
to
a
beloved
mistress
with
more
heat
and
expectation
,
than
my
uncle
Toby
did
,
to
enjoy
this
self
-
same
thing
in
private
;
 
<EOS>
I
say
in
private
;
 
<EOS>
for
it
was
sheltered
from
the
house
,
as
I
told
you
,
by
a
tall
yew
hedge
,
and
was
covered
on
the
other
three
sides
,
from
mortal
sight
,
by
rough
holly
and
thick
-
set
flowering
shrubs
:
 
so
that
the
idea
of
not
being
seen
,
did
not
a
little
contribute
to
the
idea
of
pleasure
pre
-
conceived
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Vain
thought
!
<EOS>
however
thick
it
was
planted
about
,
 
or
private
soever
it
might
seem
,
 
to
think
,
dear
uncle
Toby
,
of
enjoying
a
thing
which
took
up
a
whole
rood
and
a
half
of
ground
,
 
and
not
have
it
known
!
  
<EOS>
How
my
uncle
Toby
and
Corporal
Trim
managed
this
matter
,
 
with
the
history
of
their
campaigns
,
which
were
no
way
barren
of
events
,
 
may
make
no
uninteresting
under
-
plot
in
the
epitasis
and
working
-
up
of
this
drama
.
 
<EOS>
At
present
the
scene
must
drop
,
 
and
change
for
the
parlour
fire
-
side
.
      
<EOS>
What
can
they
be
doing
?
<EOS>
brother
,
said
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
,
 
taking
,
as
I
told
you
,
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
,
and
striking
the
ashes
out
of
it
as
he
began
his
sentence
;
 
I
think
,
replied
he
,
 
it
would
not
be
amiss
,
brother
,
if
we
rung
the
bell
.
  
<EOS>
Pray
,
what
's
all
that
racket
over
our
heads
,
Obadiah
?
 
<EOS>
quoth
<EOS>
my
father
;
 
my
brother
and
I
can
scarce
hear
ourselves
speak
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
answered
Obadiah
,
making
a
bow
towards
his
left
shoulder
,
 
my
Mistress
is
taken
very
badly
.
 
<EOS>
And
where
's
Susannah
running
down
the
garden
there
,
as
if
they
were
going
to
ravish
her
?
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
she
is
running
the
shortest
cut
into
the
town
,
replied
Obadiah
,
to
fetch
the
old
midwife
.
 
<EOS>
Then
saddle
a
horse
,
quoth
my
father
,
and
do
you
go
directly
for
Dr.
Slop
,
the
man-
midwife
,
with
all
our
services
,
 
and
let
him
know
your
mistress
is
fallen
into
labour
 
and
that
I
desire
he
will
return
with
you
with
all
speed
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
very
strange
,
says
my
father
,
addressing
himself
to
my
uncle
Toby
,
as
Obadiah
shut
the
door
,
 
as
there
is
so
expert
an
operator
as
Dr.
Slop
so
near
,
 
that
my
wife
should
persist
to
the
very
last
in
this
obstinate
humour
of
hers
,
in
trusting
the
life
of
my
child
,
who
has
had
one
misfortune
already
,
to
the
ignorance
of
an
old
woman
;
 
and
not
only
the
life
of
my
child
,
brother
,
 
but
her
own
life
,
and
with
it
the
lives
of
all
the
children
I
might
,
peradventure
,
have
begot
out
of
her
hereafter
.
  
<EOS>
Mayhap
,
brother
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
,
my
sister
does
it
to
save
the
expence
:
 
A
pudding
's
end

replied
my
father
,
 
<EOS>
the
Doctor
must
be
paid
the
same
for
inaction
as
action
,
 
if
not
better
,
 
to
keep
him
in
temper
.
    
<EOS>
Then
it
can
be
out
of
nothing
in
the
whole
world
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
in
the
simplicity
of
his
heart
,
 
but
Modesty
.
 
<EOS>
My
sister
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
added
he
<EOS>
,
does
not
care
to
let
a
man
come
so
near
her
.
.
<EOS>
..
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
whether
my
uncle
Toby
had
completed
the
sentence
or
not
;
 
'
tis
for
his
advantage
to
suppose
he
had
,
 
as
,
I
think
,
he
could
have
added
no
One
Word
which
would
have
improved
it
.
  
<EOS>
If
,
on
the
contrary
,
my
uncle
Toby
had
not
fully
arrived
at
the
period
's
end
 
then
the
world
stands
indebted
to
the
sudden
snapping
of
my
father
's
tobacco
-
pipe
for
one
of
the
neatest
examples
of
that
ornamental
figure
in
oratory
,
which
Rhetoricians
stile
the
Aposiopesis
.
 
<EOS>
Just
Heaven
!
<EOS>
how
does
the
Poco
piu
and
the
Poco
meno
of
the
Italian
artists
;
 
the
insensible
more
or
less
,
determine
the
precise
line
of
beauty
in
the
sentence
,
as
well
as
in
the
statue

<EOS>
How
do
the
slight
touches
of
the
chisel
,
the
pencil
,
the
pen
,
the
fiddle

stick

give
the

which
gives
the
true

<EOS>
O

be
nice

be
cautious

your

O

your

"
My

mayhap

quoth
my
uncle
Toby

"
does
not

<EOS>
Scratch
Backside
out

put
Cover'd

'
tis
a
Metaphor
;
 
and
,
<EOS>
I
dare
say
,
as
fortification
ran
so
much
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
head
,
that
if
he
had
been
left
to
have
added
one
word
to
the
sentence
,
 
that
word
was
it
.
  
<EOS>
But
whether
that
was
the
case
or
not
the
case
;
 
or
whether
the
snapping
of
my
father
's
tobacco
-
pipe
,
so
critically
,
happened
through
accident
or
anger
,
will
be
seen
in
due
time
.
    
<EOS>
Tho
'
<EOS>
my
father
was
a
good
natural
philosopher
,
 
yet
he
was
something
of
a
moral
philosopher
too
;
for
which
reason
,
when
his
tobacco
-
pipe
snapp'd
short
in
the
middle
,
 
he
had
nothing
to
do
,
as
such
,
but
to
have
taken
hold
of
the
two
pieces
,
and
thrown
them
gently
upon
the
back
of
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
no
such
thing
;
 
he
threw
them
with
all
the
violence
in
the
world
;
 
and
,
to
give
the
action
still
more
emphasis
,
 
he
started
upon
both
his
legs
to
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
This
looked
something
like
heat
;
 
and
the
manner
of
his
reply
to
what
my
uncle
Toby
was
saying
,
proved
it
was
so
.
    
<EOS>
"
Not
choose
,
"
quoth
my
father
,
(
repeating
my
uncle
Toby
's
words
)
"
to
let
a
man
come
so
near
her
!
"
 
<EOS>
By
Heaven
,
brother
Toby
!
<EOS>
you
would
try
the
patience
of
Job
;
 
and
I
think
I
have
the
plagues
of
one
already
without
it
.
 
<EOS>
Why
?
 
<EOS>
Where
?
 
<EOS>
Wherein
?
 
<EOS>
Wherefore
?
 
<EOS>
Upon
what
account
?
<EOS>
replied
my
uncle
Toby
:
in
the
utmost
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
To
think
,
said
my
father
,
of
a
man
living
to
your
age
,
brother
,
and
knowing
so
little
about
women
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
at
all
about
them
,
 
replied
my
uncle
Toby
:
 
<EOS>
And
I
think
,
continued
he
,
that
the
shock
I
received
the
year
after
the
demolition
of
Dunkirk
,
in
my
affair
with
widow
Wadman
;
 
which
shock
you
know
I
should
not
have
received
,
but
from
my
total
ignorance
of
the
sex
,
 
has
given
me
just
cause
to
say
,
That
I
neither
know
nor
do
pretend
to
know
any
thing
about
'em
or
their
concerns
either
.
 
<EOS>
Methinks
,
brother
,
replied
my
father
,
you
might
,
at
least
,
know
so
much
as
the
right
end
of
a
woman
from
the
wrong
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
said
in
Aristotle
's
Master
Piece
,
"
That
when
a
man
doth
think
of
any
thing
which
is
past
,
 
he
looketh
down
upon
the
ground
;
 
but
that
when
he
thinketh
of
something
that
is
to
come
,
he
looketh
up
towards
the
heavens
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
,
I
suppose
,
thought
of
neither
,
for
he
look'd
<EOS>
horizontally
.
  
<EOS>
Right
end
!
<EOS>
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
muttering
the
two
words
low
to
himself
,
and
fixing
his
two
eyes
insensibly
as
he
muttered
them
,
upon
a
small
crevice
,
formed
by
a
bad
joint
in
the
chimney
-
piece
 
<EOS>
Right
end
of
a
woman
!
 
<EOS>
I
declare
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
,
I
know
no
more
which
it
is
than
the
man
in
the
moon
;
 
and
if
I
was
to
think
,
continued
my
uncle
Toby
(
keeping
his
eyes
still
fixed
upon
the
bad
joint
)
<EOS>
this
month
together
,
I
am
sure
I
should
not
be
able
to
find
it
out
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
brother
Toby
,
replied
my
father
,
I
will
tell
you
.
  
<EOS>
Every
thing
in
this
world
,
continued
my
father
(
filling
a
fresh
pipe
)
  
<EOS>
every
thing
in
this
world
,
my
dear
brother
Toby
,
has
two
handles
.
 
<EOS>
Not
always
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
At
least
,
replied
my
father
,
every
one
has
two
hands
,
 
which
comes
to
the
same
thing
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
if
a
man
was
to
sit
down
coolly
,
and
consider
within
himself
the
make
,
the
shape
,
the
construction
,
come
-
at
-
ability
,
and
convenience
of
all
the
parts
which
constitute
the
whole
of
that
animal
,
called
Woman
,
and
compare
them
analogically
 
<EOS>
I
never
understood
rightly
the
meaning
of
that
word
,
 
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
.
    
<EOS>
Analogy
,
replied
my
father
,
is
the
certain
relation
and
agreement
which
different
 
<EOS>
Here
a
devil
of
a
rap
at
the
door
snapped
my
father
's
definition
(
like
his
tobacco
-
pipe
)
in
two
,
 
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
crushed
the
head
of
as
notable
and
curious
a
dissertation
as
ever
was
engendered
in
the
womb
of
speculation
;
 
it
was
some
months
before
my
father
could
get
an
opportunity
to
be
safely
delivered
of
it
:
 
<EOS>
And
,
at
this
hour
,
it
is
a
thing
full
as
problematical
as
the
subject
of
the
dissertation
itself
,
 
<EOS>
(
considering
the
confusion
and
distresses
of
our
domestick
misadventures
,
which
are
now
coming
thick
one
upon
the
back
of
another
)
whether
I
shall
be
able
to
find
a
place
for
it
in
the
third
volume
or
not
.
    
<EOS>
It
is
about
an
hour
and
a
half
's
tolerable
good
reading
since
my
uncle
Toby
rung
the
bell
,
when
Obadiah
was
ordered
to
saddle
a
horse
,
and
go
for
Dr.
Slop
,
the
man
-
midwife
;
 
so
that
no
one
can
say
,
with
reason
,
that
I
have
not
allowed
Obadiah
time
enough
,
poetically
speaking
,
and
considering
the
emergency
too
,
both
to
go
and
come
;
 
though
,
morally
and
truly
speaking
,
the
man
perhaps
has
scarce
had
time
to
get
on
his
boots
.
  
<EOS>
If
the
hypercritick
will
go
upon
this
;
and
is
resolved
after
all
to
take
a
pendulum
,
and
measure
the
true
distance
betwixt
the
ringing
of
the
bell
,
and
the
rap
at
the
door
;
 
and
,
after
finding
it
to
be
no
more
than
two
minutes
,
thirteen
seconds
,
and
three
-
fifths
,
 
should
take
upon
him
to
insult
over
me
for
such
a
breach
in
the
unity
,
or
rather
probability
of
time
;
 
I
would
remind
him
,
that
the
idea
of
duration
,
and
of
its
simple
modes
,
is
got
merely
from
the
train
and
succession
of
our
ideas
 
and
is
the
true
scholastic
pendulum
,
 
and
by
which
,
as
a
scholar
,
I
will
be
tried
in
this
matter
,
 
abjuring
and
detesting
the
jurisdiction
of
all
other
pendulums
whatever
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
therefore
desire
him
to
consider
that
it
is
but
poor
eight
miles
from
Shandy
-
Hall
to
Dr.
Slop
,
the
man
-
midwife
's
house
:
 
and
that
whilst
Obadiah
has
been
going
those
said
miles
and
back
<EOS>
,
I
have
brought
my
uncle
Toby
from
Namur
,
quite
across
all
Flanders
,
into
England
:
 
<EOS>
That
I
have
had
him
ill
upon
my
hands
near
four
years
;
 
and
have
since
travelled
him
and
Corporal
Trim
in
a
chariot
-
and
-
four
,
a
journey
of
near
two
hundred
miles
down
into
Yorkshire
.
 
<EOS>
all
which
put
together
,
must
have
prepared
the
reader
's
imagination
for
the
entrance
of
Dr.
Slop
upon
the
stage
,
 
as
much
,
at
least
(
I
hope
)
as
a
dance
,
a
song
,
or
a
concerto
between
the
acts
.
  
<EOS>
If
my
hypercritick
is
intractable
,
alledging
,
that
two
minutes
and
thirteen
seconds
are
no
more
than
two
minutes
and
thirteen
seconds
,
 
when
I
have
said
all
I
can
about
them
;
and
that
this
plea
,
though
it
might
save
me
dramatically
,
will
damn
me
biographically
,
rendering
my
book
from
this
very
moment
,
a
professed
Romance
,
which
,
before
,
was
a
book
apocryphal
:
 
<EOS>
If
I
am
thus
pressed
 
<EOS>
I
then
put
an
end
to
the
whole
objection
and
controversy
about
it
all
at
once
,
 
by
acquainting
him
,
that
Obadiah
had
not
got
above
threescore
yards
from
the
stable
-
yard
,
before
he
met
with
Dr.
Slop
;
 
and
indeed
he
gave
a
dirty
proof
that
he
had
met
with
him
,
and
was
within
an
ace
of
giving
a
tragical
one
too
.
  
<EOS>
Imagine
to
yourself
;
 
but
this
had
better
begin
a
new
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
Imagine
to
yourself
a
little
squat
<EOS>
,
uncourtly
figure
of
a
Doctor
Slop
,
of
about
four
feet
and
a
half
perpendicular
height
,
with
a
breadth
of
back
,
and
a
sesquipedality
of
belly
,
which
might
have
done
honour
to
a
serjeant
in
the
horse
-
guards
.
  
<EOS>
Such
were
the
out
-
lines
of
Dr.
Slop
's
figure
,
which
 
if
you
have
read
Hogarth
's
analysis
of
beauty
,
and
if
you
have
not
,
I
wish
you
would
;
 
you
must
know
,
may
as
certainly
be
caricatured
,
and
conveyed
to
the
mind
by
three
strokes
as
three
hundred
.
  
<EOS>
Imagine
such
a
one
,
 
for
such
,
I
say
,
were
the
outlines
of
Dr.
Slop
's
figure
,
coming
slowly
along
,
foot
by
foot
,
waddling
thro
'
the
dirt
upon
the
vertebrae
of
a
little
diminutive
pony
,
of
a
pretty
colour
 
<EOS>
but
of
strength
,
 
alack
!
 
<EOS>
scarce
able
to
have
made
an
amble
of
it
,
under
such
a
fardel
<EOS>
,
had
the
roads
been
in
an
ambling
condition
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
not
.
  
<EOS>
Imagine
to
yourself
,
Obadiah
mounted
upon
a
strong
monster
of
a
coach-
horse
,
pricked
into
a
full
gallop
,
and
making
all
practicable
speed
the
adverse
way
.
  
<EOS>
Pray
,
Sir
,
let
me
interest
you
a
moment
in
this
description
.
  
<EOS>
Had
Dr.
Slop
beheld
Obadiah
a
mile
off
,
posting
in
a
narrow
lane
directly
towards
him
,
at
that
monstrous
rate
,
 
splashing
and
plunging
like
a
devil
thro
'
thick
and
thin
,
as
he
approached
,
would
not
such
a
phaenomenon
,
with
such
a
vortex
of
mud
and
water
moving
along
with
it
,
round
its
axis
<EOS>
,
 
have
been
a
subject
of
juster
apprehension
to
Dr.
Slop
in
his
situation
,
than
the
worst
of
Whiston
's
comets
?
 
<EOS>
To
say
nothing
of
the
Nucleus
;
that
is
,
of
Obadiah
and
the
coach
-
horse
.
 
<EOS>
In
my
idea
,
the
vortex
alone
of
'em
was
enough
to
have
involved
and
carried
,
if
not
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
at
least
the
doctor
's
pony
,
quite
away
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
What
then
do
you
think
must
the
terror
and
hydrophobia
of
Dr.
Slop
have
been
,
when
you
read
(
which
you
are
just
going
to
do
)
that
he
was
advancing
thus
warily
along
towards
Shandy
-
Hall
,
and
had
approached
to
within
sixty
yards
of
it
,
and
within
five
yards
of
a
sudden
turn
,
made
by
an
acute
angle
of
the
garden
-
wall
,
 
and
in
the
dirtiest
part
of
a
dirty
lane
,
 
when
Obadiah
and
his
coach
-
horse
turned
the
corner
,
rapid
,
furious
,
 
pop
,
 
full
upon
him
!
 
<EOS>
Nothing
,
I
think
,
in
nature
,
can
be
supposed
more
terrible
than
such
a
rencounter
,
 
so
imprompt
!
<EOS>
so
ill
prepared
to
stand
the
shock
of
it
as
Dr.
Slop
was
.
  
<EOS>
What
could
Dr.
Slop
do
?
 
<EOS>
he
crossed
himself
+
  
<EOS>
Pugh
!
 
<EOS>
but
the
doctor
,
Sir
,
was
a
Papist
.
 
<EOS>
No
matter
;
he
had
better
have
kept
hold
of
the
pummel
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
so
;
 
<EOS>
nay
,
as
it
happened
,
he
had
better
have
done
nothing
at
all
;
for
in
crossing
himself
he
let
go
his
whip
,
 
and
in
attempting
to
save
his
whip
betwixt
his
knee
and
his
saddle
's
skirt
,
<EOS>
as
it
slipped
,
he
lost
his
stirrup
,
 
in
losing
which
he
lost
his
seat
;
 
and
in
the
multitude
of
all
these
losses
(
which
,
by
the
bye
,
shews
what
little
advantage
there
is
in
crossing
)
the
unfortunate
doctor
lost
his
presence
of
mind
.
 
<EOS>
So
that
without
waiting
for
Obadiah
's
onset
,
he
left
his
pony
to
its
destiny
,
tumbling
off
it
diagonally
,
something
in
the
stile
and
manner
of
a
pack
of
wool
,
and
without
any
other
consequence
from
the
fall
,
save
that
of
being
left
(
as
it
would
have
been
)
with
the
broadest
part
of
him
sunk
about
twelve
inches
deep
in
the
mire
.
  
<EOS>
Obadiah
pull'd
<EOS>
off
his
cap
twice
to
Dr.
Slop
;
 
once
as
he
was
falling
,
 
and
then
again
when
he
saw
him
seated
.
 
<EOS>
Ill
-
timed
complaisance
<EOS>
;
 
had
not
the
fellow
better
have
stopped
his
horse
,
and
got
off
and
<EOS>
help'd
him
?
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
he
did
all
that
his
situation
would
allow
;
 
but
<EOS>
the
Momentum
of
the
coach-
horse
was
so
great
,
that
Obadiah
could
not
do
it
all
at
once
;
he
rode
in
a
circle
<EOS>
three
times
round
Dr.
Slop
,
before
he
could
fully
accomplish
it
any
<EOS>
how
;
 
and
at
the
last
,
when
he
did
stop
his
beast
,
'
twas
done
with
such
an
explosion
of
mud
,
that
Obadiah
had
better
have
been
a
league
off
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
never
was
a
Dr.
Slop
so
beluted
,
and
so
transubstantiated
,
since
that
affair
came
into
fashion
.
    
<EOS>
When
Dr.
Slop
entered
the
back
parlour
,
where
my
father
and
my
uncle
Toby
were
discoursing
upon
the
nature
of
women
,
 
it
was
hard
to
determine
whether
Dr.
Slop
's
figure
,
or
Dr.
Slop
's
presence
,
occasioned
more
surprize
to
them
;
for
as
the
accident
happened
so
near
the
house
,
as
not
to
make
it
worth
while
for
Obadiah
to
remount
him
,
 
Obadiah
had
led
him
in
as
he
was
,
unwiped
,
unappointed
,
unannealed
,
with
all
his
stains
and
blotches
on
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
stood
like
Hamlet
's
ghost
,
motionless
and
speechless
,
for
a
full
minute
and
a
half
at
the
parlour
-
door
<EOS>
(
Obadiah
still
holding
his
hand
)
with
all
the
majesty
of
mud
.
 
<EOS>
His
hinder
parts
,
upon
which
he
had
received
his
fall
,
totally
besmeared
,
 
and
in
every
other
part
of
him
,
blotched
over
in
such
a
manner
with
Obadiah
's
explosion
,
that
you
would
have
sworn
(
without
mental
reservation
)
that
every
grain
of
it
had
taken
effect
.
  
<EOS>
Here
was
a
fair
opportunity
for
my
uncle
Toby
to
have
triumphed
over
my
father
in
his
turn
;
 
for
no
mortal
,
who
had
beheld
Dr.
Slop
in
that
pickle
,
could
have
dissented
from
so
much
,
at
least
,
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
opinion
,
"
That
mayhap
<EOS>
his
sister
might
not
care
to
let
such
a
Dr.
Slop
come
so
near
her
.
.
..
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
the
Argumentum
ad
hominem
;
and
if
my
uncle
Toby
was
not
very
expert
at
it
,
you
may
think
,
he
might
not
care
to
use
it
.
 
<EOS>
No
;
the
reason
was
,
 
'
twas
not
his
nature
to
insult
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Slop
's
presence
at
that
time
,
was
no
less
problematical
than
the
mode
of
it
;
tho
'
<EOS>
it
is
certain
,
one
moment
's
reflexion
in
my
father
might
have
solved
it
;
for
he
had
apprized
Dr.
Slop
but
<EOS>
the
week
before
,
that
my
mother
was
at
her
full
reckoning
;
and
as
the
doctor
had
heard
nothing
since
,
'
twas
natural
and
very
political
too
in
him
,
to
have
taken
a
ride
to
Shandy
-
Hall
,
as
he
did
,
merely
to
see
how
matters
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
But
my
father
's
mind
took
unfortunately
a
wrong
turn
in
the
investigation
;
running
,
like
the
hypercritick
's
,
altogether
upon
the
ringing
of
the
bell
and
the
rap
upon
the
door
,
 
measuring
their
distance
,
and
keeping
his
mind
so
intent
upon
the
operation
,
as
to
have
power
to
think
of
nothing
else
,
  
common
-
place
infirmity
of
the
greatest
mathematicians
!
<EOS>
working
with
might
and
main
at
the
demonstration
,
and
so
wasting
all
their
strength
upon
it
,
that
they
have
none
left
in
them
to
draw
the
corollary
,
to
do
good
with
.
  
<EOS>
The
ringing
of
the
bell
,
and
the
rap
upon
the
door
,
struck
likewise
strong
upon
the
sensorium
of
my
uncle
Toby
,
 
but
it
excited
a
very
different
train
of
thoughts
;
 
the
two
irreconcileable
pulsations
instantly
brought
Stevinus
,
the
great
engineer
,
along
with
them
,
into
my
uncle
Toby
's
mind
.
 
<EOS>
What
business
Stevinus
had
in
this
affair
,
 
is
the
greatest
problem
of
all
:
 
<EOS>
It
shall
be
solved
,
 
but
not
in
the
next
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
Writing
,
when
properly
managed
(
as
you
may
be
sure
I
think
mine
is
)
<EOS>
is
but
a
different
name
for
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
As
no
one
,
who
knows
what
he
is
about
in
good
company
,
would
venture
to
talk
all
;
 
so
<EOS>
no
author
,
who
understands
the
just
boundaries
of
decorum
and
good
-
breeding
,
would
presume
to
think
all
:
 
<EOS>
The
truest
respect
which
you
can
pay
to
the
reader
's
understanding
,
is
to
halve
this
matter
amicably
,
and
leave
him
something
to
imagine
,
in
his
turn
,
as
well
as
yourself
.
  
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
am
eternally
paying
him
compliments
of
this
kind
,
and
do
all
that
lies
in
my
power
to
keep
his
imagination
as
busy
as
my
own
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
<EOS>
his
turn
now
;
 
<EOS>
I
have
given
an
ample
description
of
Dr.
Slop
's
sad
overthrow
,
and
of
his
sad
appearance
in
the
back
-
parlour
;
 
<EOS>
his
imagination
must
now
go
on
with
it
for
a
while
.
  
<EOS>
Let
the
reader
imagine
then
,
that
Dr.
Slop
has
told
his
tale
 
and
in
what
words
,
and
with
what
aggravations
,
his
fancy
chooses
;
 
Let
him
suppose
,
that
Obadiah
has
told
his
tale
also
,
and
with
such
rueful
looks
of
affected
concern
,
as
he
thinks
best
will
contrast
the
two
figures
as
they
stand
by
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
Let
him
imagine
,
that
my
father
has
stepped
up
stairs
to
see
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
to
conclude
this
work
of
imagination
,
 
let
him
imagine
the
doctor
washed
,
 
rubbed
down
,
and
condoled
,
 
felicitated
,
 
got
into
a
pair
of
Obadiah
's
pumps
,
stepping
forwards
towards
the
door
,
upon
the
very
point
of
entering
upon
action
.
  
<EOS>
Truce
!
 
<EOS>
truce
,
good
Dr.
Slop
!
 
<EOS>
stay
thy
obstetrick
hand
;
 
return
it
safe
into
thy
bosom
to
keep
it
warm
;
 
little
dost
thou
know
<EOS>
what
obstacles
,
  
little
dost
thou
think
what
hidden
causes
,
retard
its
operation
!
 
<EOS>
Hast
thou
,
Dr.
Slop
,
 
hast
thou
been
entrusted
with
the
secret
articles
of
the
solemn
treaty
which
has
brought
thee
into
this
place
?
 
<EOS>
Art
thou
aware
that
at
this
instant
,
a
daughter
of
Lucina
is
put
obstetrically
over
thy
head
?
 
<EOS>
Alas
!
 
<EOS>
'
tis
too
true
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
great
son
of
Pilumnus
!
<EOS>
what
canst
thou
do
?
 
<EOS>
Thou
hast
come
forth
unarm'd
;
 
thou
hast
left
thy
tire
-
tete
,
 
thy
<EOS>
new-
invented
forceps
,
 
thy
crotchet
,
 
thy
squirt
,
and
all
thy
instruments
of
salvation
and
deliverance
,
behind
thee
,
 
By
Heaven
!
<EOS>
at
this
moment
they
are
hanging
up
in
a
green
bays
bag
,
betwixt
thy
<EOS>
two
pistols
,
at
the
bed
's
head
!
 
<EOS>
Ring
;
 
call
;
 
send
Obadiah
back
upon
the
coach
-
horse
to
bring
them
with
all
speed
.
      
<EOS>
Make
great
haste
,
Obadiah
,
quoth
my
father
,
and
I
'll
give
thee
a
crown
!
<EOS>
and
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
I
'll
give
him
another
.
    
<EOS>
Your
sudden
and
unexpected
arrival
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
addressing
himself
to
Dr.
Slop
,
(
all
three
of
them
sitting
down
to
the
fire
together
,
as
my
uncle
Toby
began
to
speak
)
 
<EOS>
instantly
brought
the
great
Stevinus
into
my
head
,
who
,
you
must
know
,
is
a
favourite
author
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
added
my
father
,
making
use
of
the
argument
Ad
Crumenam
,
 
I
will
lay
twenty
guineas
to
a
single
crown
-
piece
(
which
will
serve
to
give
away
to
Obadiah
when
he
gets
back
)
<EOS>
that
this
same
Stevinus
was
some
engineer
or
other
 
or
has
wrote
something
or
other
,
either
directly
or
indirectly
,
upon
the
science
of
fortification
.
  
<EOS>
He
has
so
,
 
replied
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
it
,
said
my
father
,
though
,
for
the
soul
of
me
,
I
can
not
see
what
kind
of
connection
there
can
be
betwixt
<EOS>
Dr.
Slop
's
sudden
coming
,
and
a
discourse
upon
fortification
;
 
yet
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
fear'd
it
.
 
<EOS>
Talk
of
what
we
will
,
brother
,
 
or
<EOS>
let
the
occasion
be
never
so
foreign
or
unfit
for
the
subject
,
 
you
are
sure
to
bring
it
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
,
<EOS>
brother
Toby
,
continued
my
father
,
 
I
declare
I
would
not
have
my
head
so
full
of
curtins
and
horn
-
works
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
dare
say
you
would
not
,
quoth
Dr.
Slop
,
interrupting
him
,
and
laughing
most
immoderately
at
his
pun
.
  
<EOS>
Dennis
the
critic
could
not
detest
and
abhor
a
pun
,
or
the
insinuation
of
a
pun
,
more
cordially
than
my
father
;
 
he
would
grow
testy
upon
it
at
any
time
;
 
but
to
be
broke
in
upon
by
one
,
in
a
serious
discourse
,
was
as
bad
,
he
would
say
,
as
a
fillip
upon
the
nose
;
 
he
saw
no
difference
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
addressing
himself
to
Dr.
Slop
,
 
<EOS>
the
curtins
my
brother
Shandy
mentions
here
,
have
nothing
to
do
with
beadsteads
;
 
tho
'
,
<EOS>
I
know
<EOS>
Du
Cange
says
,
"
That
bed
-
curtains
,
in
all
probability
,
have
taken
their
name
from
them
;
"
 
nor
have
the
horn
-
works
he
speaks
of
,
any
thing
in
the
world
to
do
with
the
horn
-
works
of
cuckoldom
:
 
But
the
Curtin
,
Sir
,
is
the
word
we
use
in
fortification
,
for
that
part
of
the
wall
or
rampart
which
lies
between
the
two
bastions
and
joins
them
 
<EOS>
Besiegers
seldom
offer
to
carry
on
their
attacks
directly
against
the
curtin
,
for
this
reason
,
because
they
are
so
well
flanked
.
 
<EOS>
(
'
Tis
the
case
of
other
curtains
,
quoth
Dr.
Slop
,
laughing
.
)
 
<EOS>
However
,
continued
my
uncle
Toby
,
to
make
them
sure
,
we
generally
choose
to
place
ravelins
before
them
,
taking
care
only
to
extend
them
beyond
the
fosse
or
ditch
:
 
<EOS>
The
common
men
,
who
know
very
little
of
fortification
,
confound
the
ravelin
and
the
half
-
moon
together
,
  
tho
<EOS>
"
they
are
very
different
things
;
 
not
in
their
figure
or
construction
,
for
we
make
them
exactly
alike
,
in
all
points
;
for
they
always
consist
of
two
faces
,
making
a
salient
angle
,
with
the
gorges
,
not
straight
,
but
in
form
of
a
crescent
;
 
<EOS>
Where
then
lies
the
difference
?
<EOS>
(
quoth
<EOS>
my
father
,
a
little
testily
.
)
 
<EOS>
In
their
situations
,
answered
my
uncle
Toby
:
 
<EOS>
For
when
a
ravelin
,
brother
,
stands
before
the
curtin
,
it
is
a
ravelin
;
and
when
a
ravelin
stands
before
a
bastion
,
then
the
ravelin
is
not
a
ravelin
;
 
it
is
a
half
-
moon
;
 
a
half
-
moon
likewise
is
a
half
-
moon
,
and
no
more
,
so
long
as
it
stands
before
its
bastion
;
 
but
was
it
to
change
place
,
and
get
before
the
curtin
,
 
'
twould
be
no
longer
a
half
-
moon
;
a
half
-
moon
,
in
that
case
,
is
not
a
half
-
moon
;
 
'
tis
no
more
than
a
ravelin
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
,
quoth
my
father
,
that
the
noble
science
of
defence
has
its
weak
sides
 
as
well
as
others
.
   
<EOS>
As
for
the
horn
-
work
(
high
!
ho
!
<EOS>
sigh'd
<EOS>
my
father
)
<EOS>
which
,
continued
my
uncle
Toby
,
my
brother
was
speaking
of
<EOS>
,
they
are
a
very
considerable
part
of
an
outwork
;
 
they
are
called
by
the
French
engineers
,
Ouvrage
a
corne
,
and
we
generally
make
them
to
cover
such
places
as
we
suspect
to
be
weaker
than
the
rest
;
 
'
tis
formed
by
two
epaulments
or
demi
-
bastions
 
they
are
very
pretty
,
 
and
if
you
will
take
a
walk
,
I
'll
engage
to
shew
you
one
well
worth
your
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
I
own
,
continued
my
uncle
Toby
,
when
we
crown
them
,
  
they
are
much
stronger
,
but
then
they
are
very
expensive
,
and
take
up
a
great
deal
of
ground
,
so
that
,
in
my
opinion
,
they
are
most
of
use
to
cover
or
defend
the
head
of
a
camp
;
otherwise
the
double
tenaille
 
<EOS>
By
the
mother
who
bore
us
!
 
<EOS>
brother
Toby
,
quoth
my
father
,
not
able
to
hold
out
any
longer
,
 
you
would
provoke
a
saint
;
 
here
<EOS>
have
you
got
us
,
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
,
not
only
souse
into
the
middle
of
the
old
subject
again
:
 
<EOS>
But
so
full
is
your
head
of
these
confounded
works
,
that
though
my
wife
is
this
moment
in
the
pains
of
labour
,
and
you
hear
her
cry
out
,
yet
nothing
will
serve
you
but
to
carry
off
the
man
-
midwife
.
 
<EOS>
Accoucheur
,
 
if
you
please
,
quoth
Dr.
Slop
.
 
<EOS>
With
all
my
heart
,
replied
my
father
,
I
do
n't
care
what
they
call
you
,
 
but
I
wish
the
whole
science
of
fortification
,
with
all
its
inventors
,
at
the
devil
;
 
it
has
been
the
death
of
thousands
,
 
and
it
will
be
mine
in
the
end
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
,
I
would
not
,
<EOS>
brother
Toby
,
have
my
brains
so
full
of
saps
,
mines
,
blinds
,
gabions
,
pallisadoes
,
ravelins
,
half
-
moons
,
and
such
trumpery
,
to
be
proprietor
of
Namur
,
and
of
all
the
towns
in
Flanders
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
was
a
man
patient
of
injuries
;
 
not
from
want
of
courage
,
 
I
have
told
you
in
a
former
chapter
,
"
that
he
was
a
man
of
courage
:
"
 
And
will
add
here
,
<EOS>
that
where
just
occasions
presented
,
or
called
it
forth
,
 
I
know
no
man
under
whose
arm
I
would
have
sooner
taken
shelter
;
 
nor
did
this
arise
from
any
insensibility
or
obtuseness
of
his
intellectual
parts
;
 
<EOS>
for
he
felt
this
insult
of
my
father
's
as
feelingly
as
a
man
could
do
;
  
<EOS>
but
he
was
of
a
peaceful
,
placid
nature
,
 
<EOS>
no
jarring
element
in
it
,
 
all
was
mixed
up
so
kindly
within
him
;
my
uncle
Toby
had
scarce
a
heart
to
retaliate
upon
a
fly
.
    
<EOS>
Go
 
<EOS>
says
he
,
one
day
at
dinner
,
to
an
over
-
grown
one
which
had
buzzed
about
his
nose
,
and
tormented
him
cruelly
all
dinner
-
time
,
 
and
which
after
infinite
attempts
,
he
had
caught
at
last
,
as
it
flew
by
him
;
 
I
'll
not
hurt
thee
,
says
my
uncle
Toby
,
rising
from
his
chair
,
and
going
across
the
room
,
with
the
fly
in
his
hand
,
 
<EOS>
I
'll
not
hurt
a
hair
of
thy
head
:
 
<EOS>
Go
,
says
he
,
lifting
up
the
sash
,
and
opening
his
hand
as
he
spoke
,
to
let
it
escape
;
  
go
,
poor
devil
,
get
thee
gone
<EOS>
,
why
should
I
hurt
thee
?
 
<EOS>
This
world
surely
is
wide
enough
to
hold
both
thee
and
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
but
ten
years
old
when
this
happened
:
 
but
<EOS>
whether
it
was
,
that
the
action
itself
was
more
in
unison
to
my
nerves
at
that
age
of
pity
,
which
instantly
set
my
whole
frame
into
one
vibration
of
most
pleasurable
sensation
;
 
or
how
far
the
manner
and
expression
of
it
might
go
towards
it
;
 
or
in
what
degree
,
or
by
what
secret
magick
,
 
a
tone
of
voice
and
harmony
of
movement
,
attuned
by
mercy
,
might
find
a
passage
to
my
heart
,
I
know
not
;
 
this
I
know
,
that
the
lesson
of
universal
good
-
will
then
taught
and
imprinted
by
my
uncle
Toby
,
has
never
since
been
worn
out
of
my
mind
:
 
<EOS>
And
tho
'
<EOS>
I
would
not
depreciate
what
the
study
of
the
Literae
humaniores
,
at
the
university
,
have
done
for
me
in
that
respect
,
or
discredit
the
other
helps
of
an
expensive
education
bestowed
upon
me
,
both
at
home
and
abroad
since
;
 
yet
I
often
think
that
I
owe
one
half
of
my
philanthropy
to
that
one
accidental
impression
.
  
<EOS>
This
is
to
serve
for
parents
and
governors
instead
of
a
whole
volume
upon
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
give
the
reader
this
stroke
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
picture
,
by
the
instrument
with
which
I
drew
the
other
parts
of
it
,
 
<EOS>
that
taking
in
no
more
than
the
mere
Hobby
-
Horsical
likeness
:
 
this
is
a
part
of
his
moral
character
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
,
in
this
patient
endurance
of
wrongs
,
which
I
mention
,
was
very
different
,
as
the
reader
must
long
ago
have
noted
;
he
had
a
much
more
acute
and
quick
sensibility
of
nature
,
attended
with
a
little
soreness
of
temper
;
tho
'
this
never
transported
him
to
any
thing
which
looked
like
malignancy
:
 
yet
in
the
little
rubs
and
vexations
of
life
,
'
twas
apt
to
shew
itself
in
a
drollish
and
witty
kind
of
peevishness
:
 
<EOS>
He
was
,
however
,
frank
and
generous
in
his
nature
;
 
at
all
times
open
to
conviction
;
and
<EOS>
in
the
little
ebullitions
of
this
subacid
humour
towards
others
,
but
particularly
towards
my
uncle
Toby
,
whom
he
truly
loved
:
 
he
would
feel
more
pain
,
ten
times
told
(
except
in
the
affair
of
my
aunt
Dinah
,
or
where
an
hypothesis
was
concerned
)
than
what
he
ever
gave
.
  
<EOS>
The
characters
of
the
two
brothers
,
in
this
view
of
them
,
reflected
light
upon
each
other
,
and
appeared
with
great
advantage
in
this
affair
which
arose
about
Stevinus
.
  
<EOS>
I
need
not
tell
the
reader
,
if
he
keeps
a
Hobby
-
Horse
,
 
that
a
man
's
Hobby-
Horse
is
as
tender
a
part
as
he
has
about
him
;
and
that
these
unprovoked
strokes
at
my
uncle
Toby
's
could
not
be
unfelt
by
him
.
 
<EOS>
No
:
 
<EOS>
as
I
said
above
,
my
uncle
Toby
did
feel
them
,
and
very
sensibly
too
.
  
<EOS>
Pray
,
Sir
,
what
said
he
?
 
<EOS>
How
did
he
behave
?
 
<EOS>
O
,
Sir
!
 
<EOS>
it
was
great
:
 
<EOS>
For
as
soon
as
my
father
had
done
insulting
his
Hobby
-
Horse
,
 
he
turned
his
head
without
the
least
emotion
,
from
Dr.
Slop
,
to
whom
he
was
addressing
his
discourse
,
and
looking
up
into
my
father
's
face
,
with
a
countenance
spread
over
with
so
much
good
-
nature
;
 
so
placid
;
 
so
fraternal
;
 
so
inexpressibly
tender
towards
him
:
 
<EOS>
it
penetrated
my
father
to
his
heart
:
 
<EOS>
He
rose
up
hastily
from
his
chair
,
and
seizing
hold
of
both
my
uncle
Toby
's
hands
as
he
spoke
:
 
Brother
Toby
,
said
he
:
 
<EOS>
I
beg
thy
pardon
;
 
forgive
<EOS>
,
I
pray
thee
,
this
rash
humour
which
my
mother
gave
me
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
,
dear
brother
,
answered
my
uncle
Toby
,
rising
up
by
my
father
's
help
,
say
no
more
about
it
;
 
you
are
heartily
welcome
,
<EOS>
had
it
been
ten
times
as
much
,
brother
.
 
<EOS>
But
'
tis
ungenerous
,
replied
my
father
,
to
hurt
any
man
;
 
a
brother
worse
;
 
but
to
hurt
a
brother
of
such
gentle
manners
,
 
so
unprovoking
,
 
and
so
unresenting
;
 
'
tis
base
:
 
By
Heaven
,
'
tis
cowardly
.
  
<EOS>
You
are
heartily
welcome
,
brother
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
<EOS>
,
 
had
it
been
<EOS>
fifty
times
as
much
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
what
have
I
to
do
,
my
dear
Toby
,
cried
my
father
,
either
with
your
amusements
or
your
pleasures
,
unless
it
was
in
my
power
(
which
it
is
not
)
to
increase
their
measure
?
    
<EOS>
Brother
Shandy
,
answered
my
uncle
Toby
,
looking
wistfully
in
his
face
,
  
you
are
much
mistaken
in
this
point
:
 
for
you
do
increase
my
pleasure
very
much
,
in
begetting
children
for
the
Shandy
family
at
your
time
of
life
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
by
that
,
Sir
,
quoth
Dr.
Slop
,
Mr.
Shandy
increases
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
jot
,
quoth
my
father
.
    
<EOS>
My
brother
does
it
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
out
of
principle
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
family
way
,
I
suppose
,
quoth
Dr.
Slop
.
 
<EOS>
Pshaw
!
 
<EOS>
said
my
father
,
 
'
<EOS>
tis
not
worth
talking
of
.
    
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
the
last
chapter
,
my
father
and
my
uncle
Toby
were
left
both
standing
,
like
Brutus
and
Cassius
,
at
the
close
of
the
scene
,
making
up
their
accounts
.
  
<EOS>
As
my
father
spoke
the
three
last
words
,
 
he
sat
down
;
 
my
uncle
Toby
exactly
followed
his
example
,
only
,
that
before
he
took
his
chair
,
he
rung
the
bell
,
to
order
Corporal
Trim
,
who
was
in
waiting
,
to
step
home
for
Stevinus
:
 
my
uncle
Toby
's
house
being
no
farther
off
than
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
Some
men
would
have
dropped
the
subject
of
Stevinus
;
 
but
my
uncle
Toby
had
no
resentment
in
his
heart
,
and
he
went
on
with
the
subject
,
to
shew
my
father
that
he
had
none
.
  
<EOS>
Your
sudden
appearance
,
Dr.
Slop
,
quoth
my
uncle
,
resuming
the
discourse
,
instantly
brought
Stevinus
into
my
head
.
 
<EOS>
(
My
father
,
you
may
be
sure
,
did
not
offer
to
lay
any
more
wagers
upon
Stevinus
's
head
.
)
 
<EOS>
Because
,
continued
my
uncle
Toby
,
the
celebrated
sailing
chariot
,
which
belonged
to
Prince
Maurice
,
and
was
of
such
wonderful
contrivance
and
velocity
,
as
to
carry
half
a
dozen
people
thirty
German
miles
,
in
I
do
n't
know
how
few
minutes
,
  
was
invented
by
Stevinus
,
that
great
mathematician
and
engineer
.
  
<EOS>
You
might
have
spared
your
servant
the
trouble
,
quoth
Dr.
Slop
(
as
the
fellow
is
lame
)
of
going
for
Stevinus
's
account
of
it
,
because
in
my
return
from
Leyden
thro
'
the
Hague
,
I
walked
as
far
as
Schevling
,
which
is
two
long
miles
,
on
purpose
to
take
a
view
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
That
's
nothing
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
,
to
what
the
learned
Peireskius
did
,
who
walked
a
matter
of
five
hundred
miles
,
reckoning
from
Paris
to
Schevling
,
and
from
Schevling
to
Paris
back
again
,
in
order
to
see
it
,
and
nothing
else
.
  
<EOS>
Some
men
can
not
bear
to
be
out
-
gone
.
  
<EOS>
The
more
fool
Peireskius
,
replied
Dr.
Slop
.
 
<EOS>
But
mark
,
'
twas
out
of
no
contempt
of
Peireskius
at
all
;
 
but
that
Peireskius
's
indefatigable
labour
in
trudging
so
far
on
foot
,
out
of
love
for
the
sciences
,
reduced
the
exploit
of
Dr.
Slop
,
in
that
affair
,
to
nothing
:
 
the
more
fool
Peireskius
,
said
he
again
.
 
<EOS>
Why
so
?
 
<EOS>
replied
my
father
,
taking
his
brother
's
part
,
not
only
to
make
reparation
as
fast
as
he
could
for
the
insult
he
had
given
him
,
which
sat
still
upon
my
father
's
mind
;
 
but
partly
,
that
my
father
began
really
to
interest
himself
in
the
discourse
.
 
<EOS>
Why
so
?
 
<EOS>
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
Why
is
Peireskius
,
or
any
man
else
,
to
be
abused
for
an
appetite
for
that
,
or
any
other
morsel
of
sound
knowledge
:
 
<EOS>
For
notwithstanding
I
know
nothing
of
the
chariot
in
question
,
continued
he
,
the
inventor
of
it
must
have
had
a
very
mechanical
head
;
and
tho
"
<EOS>
I
can
not
guess
upon
what
principles
of
philosophy
he
has
atchieved
it
;
 
yet
certainly
his
machine
has
been
constructed
upon
solid
ones
,
<EOS>
be
they
what
they
will
,
or
it
could
not
have
answered
at
the
rate
my
brother
mentions
.
  
<EOS>
It
answered
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
,
as
well
,
if
not
better
;
for
,
as
Peireskius
elegantly
expresses
it
,
speaking
of
the
velocity
of
its
motion
,
Tam
citus
erat
,
quam
erat
ventus
;
which
,
unless
I
have
forgot
my
Latin
,
is
,
that
it
was
as
swift
as
the
wind
itself
.
  
<EOS>
But
pray
,
Dr.
Slop
,
quoth
my
father
,
interrupting
my
uncle
(
tho
'
not
without
begging
pardon
for
it
at
the
same
time
)
upon
what
principles
was
this
self
-
same
chariot
set
a
-
going
?
 
<EOS>
Upon
very
pretty
principles
to
be
sure
,
replied
Dr.
Slop
:
 
<EOS>
And
I
have
often
wondered
,
continued
he
,
evading
the
question
,
why
none
of
our
gentry
,
who
live
upon
large
plains
like
this
of
ours
,
 
(
especially
they
whose
wives
are
not
past
child
-
bearing
)
attempt
nothing
of
this
kind
;
for
it
would
not
only
be
infinitely
expeditious
upon
sudden
calls
,
to
which
the
sex
is
subject
,
 
if
the
wind
only
served
,
 
but
would
be
excellent
good
husbandry
to
make
use
of
the
winds
,
which
cost
nothing
,
and
which
eat
nothing
,
rather
than
horses
,
which
<EOS>
(
the
devil
take
'em
)
<EOS>
both
cost
and
eat
a
great
deal
.
  
<EOS>
For
that
very
reason
,
replied
my
father
,
"
Because
they
cost
nothing
,
and
because
they
eat
nothing
,
"
 
the
scheme
is
bad
;
 
it
is
the
consumption
of
our
products
,
as
well
as
the
manufactures
of
them
,
which
gives
bread
to
the
hungry
,
circulates
trade
,
 
brings
in
money
,
and
supports
the
value
of
our
lands
;
 
and
tho
'
,
<EOS>
I
own
,
<EOS>
if
I
was
a
Prince
,
I
would
generously
recompense
the
scientifick
head
which
brought
forth
such
contrivances
;
 
yet
I
would
as
peremptorily
suppress
the
use
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
here
had
got
into
his
element
,
 
and
was
going
on
as
prosperously
with
his
dissertation
upon
trade
,
as
my
uncle
Toby
had
before
,
upon
his
of
fortification
;
 
but
to
the
loss
of
much
sound
knowledge
,
the
destinies
in
the
morning
had
decreed
that
no
dissertation
of
any
kind
should
be
spun
by
my
father
that
day
,
 
for
as
he
opened
his
mouth
to
begin
the
next
sentence
,
    
<EOS>
In
popped
Corporal
Trim
with
Stevinus
:
 
<EOS>
But
'
twas
too
late
,
 
all
the
discourse
had
been
exhausted
without
him
,
and
was
running
into
a
new
channel
.
    
<EOS>
You
may
take
the
book
home
again
,
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
nodding
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
But
prithee
,
Corporal
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
father
,
drolling
,
 
look
first
into
it
,
and
see
if
thou
canst
spy
aught
of
a
sailing
chariot
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
Corporal
Trim
,
by
being
in
the
service
,
had
learned
to
obey
,
 
and
not
to
remonstrate
,
 
so
taking
the
book
to
a
side
-
table
,
and
running
over
the
leaves
;
An
'
please
your
Honour
<EOS>
,
said
Trim
,
I
can
see
no
such
thing
;
  
however
,
continued
the
Corporal
,
drolling
a
little
in
his
turn
,
I
'll
make
sure
work
of
it
,
an
'
please
your
Honour
;
 
so
taking
hold
of
the
two
covers
of
the
book
,
one
in
each
hand
,
and
letting
the
leaves
fall
down
as
he
bent
the
covers
back
,
he
gave
the
book
a
good
sound
shake
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
something
falling
out
,
however
,
said
Trim
,
an
'
please
your
Honour
;
 
but
it
is
not
a
chariot
,
or
any
thing
like
one
:
 
<EOS>
Prithee
,
Corporal
,
said
my
father
,
smiling
<EOS>
,
what
is
it
then
?
 
<EOS>
I
think
,
answered
Trim
,
stooping
to
take
it
up
,
 
'
tis
more
like
a
sermon
,
 
for
it
begins
with
a
text
of
scripture
,
and
the
chapter
and
verse
;
 
and
then
goes
on
,
not
as
a
chariot
,
but
like
a
sermon
directly
.
  
<EOS>
The
company
smiled
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
conceive
how
it
is
possible
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
for
such
a
thing
as
a
sermon
to
have
got
into
my
Stevinus
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
'
tis
a
sermon
,
replied
Trim
:
 
but
if
it
please
your
Honours
,
as
it
is
a
fair
hand
,
I
will
read
you
a
page
;
 
for
Trim
,
you
must
know
,
loved
to
hear
himself
read
almost
as
well
as
talk
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
ever
a
strong
propensity
,
said
my
father
,
to
look
into
things
which
cross
my
way
,
by
such
strange
fatalities
as
these
;
 
and
as
we
have
nothing
better
to
do
,
at
least
till
Obadiah
gets
back
,
I
shall
be
obliged
to
you
,
brother
,
if
Dr.
Slop
has
no
objection
to
it
,
to
order
the
Corporal
to
give
us
a
page
or
two
of
it
,
 
if
he
is
as
able
to
do
it
,
as
he
seems
willing
.
 
<EOS>
An
'
please
your
honour
<EOS>
,
quoth
Trim
,
I
officiated
two
whole
campaigns
,
in
Flanders
,
as
clerk
to
the
chaplain
of
the
regiment
.
 
<EOS>
He
can
read
it
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
as
well
as
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
Trim
,
I
assure
you
,
was
the
best
scholar
in
my
company
,
and
should
have
had
the
next
halberd
,
but
for
the
poor
fellow
's
misfortune
.
 
<EOS>
Corporal
Trim
laid
his
hand
upon
his
heart
,
and
made
an
humble
bow
to
his
master
;
then
laying
down
his
hat
upon
the
floor
,
and
taking
up
the
sermon
in
his
left
hand
,
in
order
to
have
his
right
at
liberty
,
 
he
advanced
,
nothing
doubting
,
into
the
middle
of
the
room
,
where
he
could
best
see
,
and
be
best
seen
by
his
audience
.
      
<EOS>
If
you
have
any
objection
,
 
said
my
father
,
addressing
himself
to
Dr.
Slop
.
 
<EOS>
Not
in
the
least
,
replied
Dr.
Slop
;
 
for
it
does
not
appear
on
which
side
of
the
question
it
is
wrote
,
 
it
may
be
a
composition
of
a
divine
of
our
church
,
as
well
as
yours
,
 
so
that
we
run
equal
risques
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
wrote
upon
neither
side
,
quoth
Trim
,
for
'
tis
only
upon
Conscience
,
an
'
please
your
Honours
.
  
<EOS>
Trim
's
reason
put
his
audience
into
good
humour
,
 
all
but
Dr.
Slop
,
who
turning
his
head
about
towards
Trim
,
looked
a
little
angry
.
  
<EOS>
Begin
,
Trim
,
 
and
read
distinctly
,
quoth
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
,
an
'
please
your
Honour
,
replied
the
Corporal
,
making
a
bow
,
and
bespeaking
attention
with
a
slight
movement
of
his
right
hand
.
      
<EOS>
But
before
the
Corporal
begins
,
I
must
first
give
you
a
description
of
his
attitude
;
 
<EOS>
otherwise
he
will
naturally
stand
represented
,
by
your
imagination
,
in
an
uneasy
posture
,
 
stiff
,
 
perpendicular
,
 
dividing
the
weight
of
his
body
equally
upon
both
legs
;
 
his
eye
fixed
,
as
if
on
duty
;
  
his
look
determined
,
 
clenching
the
sermon
in
his
left
hand
,
like
his
firelock
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
you
would
be
apt
to
paint
Trim
,
as
if
he
was
standing
in
his
platoon
ready
for
action
,
 
<EOS>
His
attitude
was
as
unlike
all
this
as
you
can
conceive
.
  
<EOS>
He
stood
before
them
with
his
body
swayed
,
and
<EOS>
bent
forwards
just
so
far
,
as
to
make
an
angle
of
85
degrees
and
a
half
upon
the
plain
of
the
horizon
;
 
which
sound
orators
,
to
whom
I
address
this
,
know
very
well
to
be
the
true
persuasive
angle
of
incidence
;
 
in
any
other
angle
you
may
talk
and
preach
;
 
'
<EOS>
tis
certain
;
 
and
it
is
done
every
day
;
 
<EOS>
but
with
what
effect
,
 
I
leave
the
world
to
judge
!
  
<EOS>
The
necessity
of
this
precise
angle
of
85
degrees
and
a
half
to
a
mathematical
exactness
,
 
does
it
not
shew
us
,
by
the
way
,
how
the
arts
and
sciences
mutually
befriend
each
other
?
  
<EOS>
How
the
duce
Corporal
Trim
,
who
knew
not
so
much
as
an
acute
angle
from
an
obtuse
one
,
came
to
hit
it
so
exactly
;
 
or
whether
it
was
chance
or
nature
,
or
good
sense
or
imitation
,
&
c.
shall
be
commented
upon
in
that
part
of
the
cyclopaedia
of
arts
and
sciences
,
where
the
instrumental
parts
of
the
eloquence
of
the
senate
,
the
pulpit
,
and
the
bar
,
the
coffee
-
house
,
the
bed
-
chamber
,
and
fire
-
side
,
fall
under
consideration
.
  
<EOS>
He
stood
,
 
for
I
repeat
it
,
to
take
the
picture
of
him
in
at
one
view
,
with
his
body
swayed
,
and
somewhat
bent
forwards
,
 
his
right
leg
from
under
him
,
sustaining
seven
-
eighths
of
his
whole
weight
,
 
the
foot
of
his
left
leg
,
the
defect
of
which
was
no
disadvantage
to
his
attitude
,
advanced
a
little
,
 
not
laterally
,
nor
forwards
,
but
in
a
line
betwixt
them
;
 
his
knee
bent
,
but
that
not
violently
,
 
but
so
as
to
fall
within
the
limits
of
the
line
of
beauty
;
 
and
I
add
,
of
the
line
of
science
too
;
 
for
consider
,
it
had
one
eighth
part
of
his
body
to
bear
up
;
 
so
that
in
this
case
the
position
of
the
leg
is
determined
,
 
because
the
foot
could
be
no
farther
advanced
,
or
the
knee
more
bent
,
than
what
would
allow
him
,
mechanically
to
receive
an
eighth
part
of
his
whole
weight
under
it
,
and
to
carry
it
too
.
  
<EOS>
>
<EOS>
This
<EOS>
I
recommend
to
painters
;
 
need
I
add
,
 
to
orators
!
 
<EOS>
I
think
not
;
for
unless
they
practise
it
,
 
they
must
fall
upon
their
noses
.
  
<EOS>
So
much
for
Corporal
Trim
's
body
and
legs
.
 
<EOS>
He
held
the
sermon
loosely
,
not
carelessly
,
in
his
left
hand
,
raised
something
above
his
stomach
,
and
detached
a
little
from
his
breast
;
 
his
right
arm
falling
negligently
by
his
side
,
as
nature
and
the
laws
of
gravity
ordered
it
,
 
but
with
the
palm
of
it
open
and
turned
towards
his
audience
,
ready
to
aid
the
sentiment
in
case
it
stood
in
need
.
  
<EOS>
Corporal
Trim
's
eyes
and
the
muscles
of
his
face
were
in
full
harmony
with
the
other
parts
of
him
;
 
<EOS>
he
looked
frank
,
 
unconstrained
,
 
something
assured
,
 
but
not
bordering
upon
assurance
.
  
<EOS>
Let
not
the
critic
ask
how
Corporal
Trim
could
come
by
all
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
told
him
it
should
be
explained
;
 
but
<EOS>
so
he
stood
before
my
father
,
my
uncle
Toby
,
and
Dr.
Slop
,
 
so
swayed
his
body
,
so
contrasted
his
limbs
,
and
with
such
an
oratorical
sweep
throughout
the
whole
figure
,
 
a
statuary
might
have
modelled
from
it
;
 
<EOS>
nay
,
I
doubt
whether
the
oldest
Fellow
of
a
College
,
 
or
the
Hebrew
Professor
himself
,
could
have
much
mended
it
.
  
<EOS>
Trim
made
a
bow
,
and
read
as
follows
:
  
The
Sermon
.
  
<EOS>
Hebrews
xiii
.
<EOS>
18
.
    
<EOS>
For
we
trust
we
have
a
good
Conscience
.
  
<EOS>
"
Trust
!
 
<EOS>
Trust
we
have
a
good
conscience
!
"
  
<EOS>
(
Certainly
,
Trim
,
quoth
my
father
,
interrupting
him
,
you
give
that
sentence
a
very
improper
accent
;
for
you
curl
up
your
nose
,
man
,
and
read
it
with
such
a
sneering
tone
,
as
if
the
Parson
was
going
to
abuse
the
Apostle
.
  
<EOS>
He
is
,
an
'
please
your
Honour
,
replied
Trim
.
 
<EOS>
Pugh
!
said
my
father
,
smiling
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
quoth
Dr.
Slop
,
Trim
is
certainly
in
the
right
;
for
the
writer
(
who
I
perceive
is
a
Protestant
)
by
the
snappish
manner
in
which
he
takes
up
the
apostle
,
is
certainly
going
to
abuse
him
;
 
if
this
treatment
of
him
has
not
done
it
already
.
 
<EOS>
But
from
whence
,
replied
my
father
,
<EOS>
have
you
concluded
so
soon
,
Dr.
Slop
,
that
the
writer
is
of
our
church
?
 
<EOS>
for
aught
<EOS>
I
can
see
yet
,
 
he
may
be
of
any
church
.
 
<EOS>
Because
,
answered
Dr.
Slop
,
if
he
was
of
ours
,
 
he
durst
no
more
take
such
a
licence
,
 
than
a
bear
by
his
beard
:
  
<EOS>
If
,
in
our
communion
,
Sir
,
a
man
was
to
insult
an
apostle
,
 
a
saint
,
 
or
even
the
paring
of
a
saint
's
nail
,
 
he
would
have
his
eyes
scratched
out
.
  
<EOS>
What
,
by
the
saint
?
<EOS>
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
replied
Dr.
Slop
,
he
would
have
an
old
house
over
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
is
the
Inquisition
an
ancient
building
,
answered
my
uncle
Toby
,
or
is
it
a
modern
one
?
 
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
of
architecture
,
replied
Dr.
Slop
.
 
<EOS>
An
'
please
your
Honours
,
quoth
Trim
,
the
Inquisition
is
the
vilest
 
Prithee
spare
thy
description
,
<EOS>
Trim
,
I
hate
the
very
name
of
it
,
said
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
No
matter
for
that
,
answered
Dr.
Slop
,
  
it
has
its
uses
;
for
tho
'
I
'm
no
great
advocate
for
it
,
yet
,
in
such
a
case
as
this
,
he
would
soon
be
taught
better
manners
;
and
I
can
tell
him
,
if
he
went
on
at
that
rate
,
would
be
flung
into
the
Inquisition
for
his
pains
.
 
<EOS>
God
help
him
then
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
Amen
,
added
Trim
;
for
Heaven
above
knows
,
I
have
a
poor
brother
who
has
been
fourteen
years
a
captive
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
never
heard
one
word
of
it
before
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
hastily
:
 
<EOS>
How
came
he
there
,
Trim
?
 
<EOS>
O
,
Sir
,
the
story
will
make
your
heart
bleed
,
 
as
it
has
made
mine
a
thousand
times
;
 
but
it
is
too
long
to
be
told
now
;
 
<EOS>
your
Honour
shall
hear
it
from
first
to
last
some
day
when
I
am
working
beside
you
in
our
fortifications
;
 
but
the
short
of
the
story
is
this
;
 
That
my
brother
Tom
went
over
a
servant
to
Lisbon
,
 
and
then
married
a
Jew
's
widow
,
who
kept
a
small
shop
,
and
sold
sausages
,
which
somehow
or
other
,
was
the
cause
of
his
being
taken
in
the
middle
of
the
night
out
of
his
bed
,
where
he
was
lying
with
his
wife
and
two
small
children
,
and
carried
directly
to
the
Inquisition
,
where
,
God
help
him
,
continued
Trim
,
fetching
a
sigh
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
,
 
the
poor
honest
lad
lies
confined
at
this
hour
;
he
was
as
honest
a
soul
,
added
Trim
,
(
pulling
out
his
handkerchief
)
as
ever
blood
warmed
.
      
<EOS>
The
tears
trickled
down
Trim
's
cheeks
faster
than
he
could
well
wipe
them
away
.
 
<EOS>
A
dead
silence
in
the
room
ensued
for
some
minutes
.
 
<EOS>
Certain
proof
of
pity
!
  
<EOS>
Come
Trim
,
quoth
my
father
,
after
he
saw
the
poor
fellow
's
grief
had
got
a
little
vent
,
 
read
on
,
 
and
put
this
melancholy
story
out
of
thy
head
:
 
<EOS>
I
grieve
that
I
interrupted
thee
;
but
prithee
begin
the
sermon
again
;
 
<EOS>
for
if
the
first
sentence
in
it
is
matter
of
abuse
,
as
thou
sayest
,
I
have
a
great
desire
to
know
what
kind
of
provocation
the
apostle
has
given
.
  
<EOS>
Corporal
Trim
wiped
his
face
,
and
returned
his
handkerchief
into
his
pocket
,
and
,
making
a
bow
as
he
did
it
,
 
he
began
again

<EOS>
The
Sermon
.
  
<EOS>
Hebrews
xiii
.
<EOS>
18
.
    
<EOS>
For
we
trust
we
have
a
good
Conscience
.
    
<EOS>
"
Trust
!
<EOS>
trust
<EOS>
we
have
a
good
conscience
!
 
<EOS>
Surely
if
there
is
any
thing
in
this
life
which
a
man
may
depend
upon
,
and
to
the
knowledge
of
which
he
is
capable
of
arriving
upon
the
most
indisputable
evidence
,
it
must
be
this
very
thing
,
 
whether
he
has
a
good
conscience
or
no
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
(
I
am
positive
I
am
right
,
quoth
Dr.
Slop
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
If
a
man
thinks
at
all
,
he
can
not
well
be
a
stranger
to
the
true
state
of
this
account
:
 
<EOS>
he
must
be
privy
to
his
own
thoughts
and
desires
;
 
he
must
remember
his
past
pursuits
,
and
know
certainly
the
true
springs
and
motives
,
which
,
in
general
,
have
governed
the
actions
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
(
I
defy
him
,
without
an
assistant
,
quoth
Dr.
Slop
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
In
other
matters
we
may
be
deceived
by
false
appearances
;
and
,
as
the
wise
man
complains
,
hardly
do
we
guess
aright
at
the
things
that
are
upon
the
earth
,
and
with
labour
do
we
find
the
things
that
are
before
us
.
 
<EOS>
But
here
the
mind
has
all
the
evidence
and
facts
within
herself
;
 
is
conscious
of
the
web
she
has
wove
;
 
knows
its
texture
and
fineness
,
and
the
exact
share
which
every
passion
has
had
in
working
upon
the
several
designs
which
virtue
or
vice
has
planned
before
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
(
The
language
is
good
,
and
I
declare
Trim
reads
very
well
,
quoth
my
father
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
 
as
conscience
is
nothing
else
but
the
knowledge
which
the
mind
has
within
herself
of
this
;
and
the
judgment
,
either
of
approbation
or
censure
,
which
it
unavoidably
makes
upon
the
successive
actions
of
our
lives
;
'
tis
plain
you
will
say
,
from
the
very
terms
of
the
proposition
,
 
whenever
this
inward
testimony
goes
against
a
man
,
and
he
stands
self
-
accused
,
that
he
must
necessarily
be
a
guilty
man
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
on
the
contrary
,
when
the
report
is
favourable
on
his
side
,
and
his
heart
condemns
him
not
:
 
that
it
is
not
a
matter
of
trust
,
as
the
apostle
intimates
,
but
a
matter
of
certainty
and
fact
,
that
the
conscience
is
good
,
and
that
the
man
must
be
good
also
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
(
Then
the
apostle
is
altogether
in
the
wrong
,
I
suppose
,
quoth
Dr.
Slop
,
and
the
Protestant
divine
is
in
the
right
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
have
patience
,
replied
my
father
,
for
I
think
it
will
presently
appear
that
St.
Paul
and
the
Protestant
divine
are
both
of
an
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
As
nearly
so
,
quoth
Dr.
Slop
,
as
east
is
to
west
;
 
but
this
,
continued
he
,
lifting
both
hands
,
comes
from
the
liberty
of
the
press
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
no
more
at
the
worst
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
,
than
the
liberty
of
the
pulpit
;
for
it
does
not
appear
that
the
sermon
is
printed
,
or
ever
likely
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
Go
on
,
Trim
,
quoth
my
father
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
At
first
sight
this
may
seem
to
be
a
true
state
of
the
case
:
 
and
I
make
no
doubt
<EOS>
but
the
knowledge
of
right
and
wrong
is
so
truly
impressed
upon
the
mind
of
man
,
 
<EOS>
that
did
no
such
thing
ever
happen
,
as
that
the
conscience
of
a
man
,
by
long
habits
of
sin
,
might
(
as
the
scripture
assures
it
may
)
insensibly
become
hard
;
 
and
,
like
some
tender
parts
of
his
body
,
by
much
stress
and
continual
hard
usage
,
lose
by
degrees
that
nice
sense
and
perception
with
which
God
and
nature
endowed
it
:
 
<EOS>
Did
this
never
happen
;
 
or
was
it
certain
that
self
-
love
could
never
hang
the
least
bias
upon
the
judgment
;
 
or
that
the
little
interests
below
could
rise
up
and
perplex
the
faculties
of
our
upper
regions
,
and
encompass
them
about
with
clouds
and
thick
darkness
:
 
<EOS>
Could
no
such
thing
as
favour
and
affection
enter
this
sacred
Court
 
<EOS>
Did
Wit
disdain
to
take
a
bribe
in
it
;
 
or
was
ashamed
to
shew
its
face
as
an
advocate
for
an
unwarrantable
enjoyment
:
 
<EOS>
Or
,
lastly
,
were
we
assured
that
Interest
stood
always
unconcerned
whilst
<EOS>
the
cause
was
hearing
 
and
that
Passion
never
got
into
the
judgment
-
seat
,
and
pronounced
sentence
in
the
stead
of
Reason
,
which
is
supposed
always
to
preside
and
determine
upon
the
case
:
 
<EOS>
Was
this
truly
so
,
as
the
objection
must
suppose
;
 
no
doubt
then
the
religious
and
moral
state
of
a
man
would
be
exactly
what
he
himself
esteemed
it
:
 
and
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
every
man
's
life
could
be
known
,
in
general
,
by
no
better
measure
,
than
the
degrees
of
his
own
approbation
and
censure
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
own
,
in
one
case
,
whenever
a
man
's
conscience
does
accuse
him
(
as
it
seldom
errs
on
that
side
)
<EOS>
that
he
is
guilty
;
 
and
unless
in
melancholy
and
hypocondriac
cases
,
we
may
safely
pronounce
upon
it
,
that
there
is
always
sufficient
grounds
for
the
accusation
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
the
converse
of
the
proposition
will
not
hold
true
;
 
namely
,
that
whenever
there
is
guilt
,
the
conscience
must
accuse
;
and
if
it
does
not
,
that
a
man
is
therefore
innocent
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
not
fact
 
So
that
the
common
consolation
which
some
good
christian
or
other
is
hourly
administering
to
himself
,
 
that
he
thanks
God
<EOS>
his
mind
does
not
misgive
him
;
and
that
,
consequently
,
he
has
a
good
conscience
,
because
he
hath
a
quiet
one
,
 
is
fallacious
;
 
and
as
current
as
the
inference
is
,
and
as
infallible
as
the
rule
appears
at
first
sight
,
yet
when
you
look
nearer
to
it
,
and
try
the
truth
of
this
rule
upon
plain
facts
,
 
you
see
it
liable
to
so
much
error
from
a
false
application
;
 
the
principle
upon
which
it
goes
so
often
perverted
;
 
the
whole
force
of
it
lost
,
and
sometimes
so
vilely
cast
away
,
that
it
is
painful
to
produce
the
common
examples
from
human
life
,
which
confirm
the
account
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
man
shall
be
vicious
and
utterly
debauched
in
his
principles
;
  
exceptionable
in
his
conduct
to
the
world
;
shall
live
shameless
,
in
the
open
commission
of
a
sin
which
no
reason
or
pretence
can
justify
,
 
a
sin
by
which
,
contrary
to
all
the
workings
of
humanity
,
he
shall
ruin
for
ever
the
deluded
partner
of
his
guilt
;
 
rob
her
of
her
best
dowry
;
and
not
only
cover
her
own
head
with
dishonour
;
 
but
involve
a
whole
virtuous
family
in
shame
and
sorrow
for
her
sake
.
 
<EOS>
Surely
,
you
will
think
conscience
must
lead
such
a
man
a
troublesome
life
;
he
can
have
no
rest
night
and
day
from
its
reproaches
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
<EOS>
Conscience
had
something
else
to
do
all
this
time
,
than
break
in
upon
him
;
as
Elijah
reproached
the
god
Baal
,
 
this
domestic
god
was
either
talking
,
or
pursuing
,
or
was
in
a
journey
,
or
peradventure
he
slept
and
could
not
be
awoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
He
was
gone
out
in
company
with
Honour
to
fight
a
duel
:
to
pay
off
some
debt
at
play
;
 
or
dirty
annuity
,
the
bargain
of
his
lust
;
Perhaps
Conscience
all
this
time
was
engaged
at
home
,
talking
aloud
against
petty
larceny
,
and
executing
vengeance
upon
some
such
puny
crimes
as
his
fortune
and
rank
of
life
secured
him
against
all
temptation
of
committing
;
so
that
he
lives
as
merrily
;
"

If
he
was
of
our
church

Dr.

sleeps
as
soundly
in

bed

and
at
last
meets
death
unconcernedly

perhaps
much
more
so
,
than
a
much
better
man
.

<EOS>
(
All
this
is
impossible
with
us

quoth
Dr.
Slop

turning
to
my

case

not

It

my

own

Dr.

(
struck
a
little
with
my

frank
acknowledgment

<EOS>
that
a
man
in
the
Romish
church
may
live
as
badly
;

then
he
can
not
easily
die
so

Tis
little
matter

replied
my
father

with
an
air
of
indifference

how
a
rascal
dies

I
mean

answered
Dr.

would
be
denied

my

my

not
accented

interjection

that
particular
species

no

Aye

my

Toby
,
shaking
his
head
,
 
these
are

Trim

<EOS>
O
!
<EOS>
very
poor
work
,
answered
Trim
,
to
what
your
Honour
<EOS>
and
I
make
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
character
of
this
last
man
,
said
Dr.
Slop
,
interrupting
Trim
,
is
more
detestable
than
all
the
rest
;
and
seems
to
have
been
taken
from
some
pettifogging
Lawyer
amongst
you
:
 
Amongst
us
,
a
man
's
conscience
could
not
possibly
continue
so
long
blinded
,
 
three
times
in
a
year
,
at
least
,
he
must
go
to
confession
.
 
<EOS>
Will
that
restore
it
to
sight
?

quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby

Go
on

Trim

quoth
<EOS>
my
father

or
Obadiah
will
have
got
back
before
thou
has
got
to
the

of
thy

<EOS>
'
Tis
a
very
short
one

replied
Trim
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
it
was
longer

<EOS>
my

I

it

"
A
fourth
man
shall
want
even
this
refuge

shall
break
through
all
their
ceremony
of
slow
chicane

the
doubtful
workings

about

Horrid

But
indeed
much
better
was
not
to
be
expected
,
in
the
present
case
 
the
poor
man
was
in
the
dark
!
 
<EOS>
his
priest
had
got
the
keeping
of
his
conscience
;
 
and
all
he
would
let
him
know
of
it
,
was
,
That
he
must
believe
in
the
Pope
;
 
go
to
Mass
;
  
cross
himself
;
 
tell
his
beads
;
 
be
a
good
Catholic
,
and
that
this
,
in
all
conscience
,
was
enough
to
carry
him
to
heaven
.
 
<EOS>
What
;
 
if
he
perjures
?
  
<EOS>
Why
;
 
he
had
a
mental
reservation
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
he
is
so
wicked
and
abandoned
a
wretch
as
you
represent
him
;
 
if
he
robs
,
 
if
he
stabs
,
will
not
conscience
,
on
every
such
act
,
receive
a
wound
itself
?
 
<EOS>
Aye
,
 
but
the
man
has
carried
it
to
confession
;
 
the
wound
digests
there
,
and
will
do
well
enough
,
and
in
a
short
time
be
quite
healed
up
by
absolution

not
content
with
the

fatal
ways

thro
"
which
the
heart
of
man
is
every

thus
treacherous
to
itself
above
all

thou
hast
wilfully
set
open
the
wide
gate
of
deceit
before
the
face

this
unwary

apt

go
astray

peace

himself

there
is
no
peace

"
Of
this
the
common
instances
which
I
have
drawn
out
of
life
,
are
too
notorious
to
require
much
evidence
.
 
<EOS>
If
any
man
doubts
the
reality
of
them
,
or
thinks
it
impossible
for
a
man
to
be
such
a
bubble
to
himself
,
 
I
must
refer
him
a
moment
to
his
own
reflections
,
and
will
then
venture
to
trust
my
appeal
with
his
own
heart

Let
him
consider
in

different

bad

vicious
in

he

that
such
of
them

strong
inclination

custom
have
prompted
him
to
commit

are
generally
dressed
out

painted
with
all
the
false
beauties
which
a
soft
and
a
flattering
hand
can
give
them
;
 
and
that
the
others
,
to
which
he
feels
no
propensity

appear
,
at

naked

When
David
surprized
Saul
sleeping
in
the
cave
,
and
cut
off
the
skirt
of
his
robe
 
we
read
his
heart
smote
him
for
what
he
had
done
:
 
<EOS>
But
in
the
matter
of
Uriah
,
where
a
faithful
and
gallant
servant
,
whom
he
ought
to
have
loved
and
honoured
,
fell
to
make
way
for
his
lust
,
 
where
conscience
had
so
much
greater
reason
to
take
the
alarm
,
his
heart
smote
him
not
.
 
<EOS>
A
whole
year
had
almost
passed
from
first
commission
of
that
crime
,
to
the
time
Nathan
was
sent
to
reprove
him
;
and
we
read
not
once
of
the
least
sorrow
or
compunction
of
heart
which
he
testified
,
during
all
that
time
,
for
what
he
had
done

Thus
conscience
,
this
once
able
monitor
,
 
placed
on
high
as
a
judge
within
us
,
and
intended
by
our
maker
as
a
just
and
equitable
one
too
,
 
by
an
unhappy
train
of
causes
and
impediments
,
takes
often
such
imperfect
cognizance
of
what
passes

does
its
office
so
negligently
,
 
sometimes
so
corruptly
,
 
that
it
is
not
to
be
trusted
alone
;
and
therefore
we
find
there
is
a
necessity
,
an
absolute
necessity
,
of
joining
another
principle
with
it

to
aid
,
if
not
govern

its
determinations

So
that

form
a
just
judgment

what
is
of

you
not

,
in
what

<EOS>
(
I
see
plainly

I
like
the
reasoning

am
sorry
that
Dr.
Slop
has
fallen
asleep
before
the
time
of
his
conviction
:
  
for
<EOS>
it
is
now
clear
,
that
the
Parson
,
as
I
thought
at
first
,
never
insulted
St.
Paul
in
the
least
;
 
nor
has
there
been
,
brother
,
the
least
difference
between
them
.

A
great
matter
,
if
they
had
differed
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
,
 
the
best
friends
in
the
world
may
differ
sometimes
.
 
<EOS>
True
,
 
brother
Toby
quoth
<EOS>
my
father
,
shaking
hands
with
him
,
 
we
'll
fill
our
pipes
,
brother

and
then
Trim
shall
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
 
<EOS>
what
dost
thou
think
of
it
?
<EOS>
said
my
father
,
speaking
to
Corporal
Trim
,
as
he
reached
his
tobacco
-
box
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
,
answered
the
Corporal
,
that
the
seven
watch
-
men
upon
the
tower
,
who
,
I
suppose
,
are
all
centinels
there
,
 
are
more
,
an
'
please
your
Honour
,
than
were
necessary
;
 
and
,
to
go
on
at
that
rate
,
would
harrass
a
regiment
all
to
pieces
,
which
a
commanding
officer
,
who
loves
his
men
,
will
never
do
,
if
he
can
help
it
,
because
two
centinels
,
added
the
Corporal
,
are
as
good
as
twenty
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
a
commanding
officer
myself
in
the
Corps
de
Garde
a
hundred
times
,
continued
Trim
,
rising
an
inch
higher
in
his
figure
,
as
he
spoke
,
 
and
all
the
time
I
had
the
honour
to
serve
his
Majesty
King
William
,
in
relieving
the
most
considerable
posts
<EOS>
,
I
never
left
more
than
two
in
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
Very
right
,
Trim
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
 
<EOS>
but
you
do
not
consider
,
Trim
,
that
the
towers
,
in
Solomon
's
days
,
were
not
such
things
as
our
bastions
,
flanked
and
defended
by
other
works
;
 
this
,
Trim
,
was
an
invention
since
Solomon
's
death
;
nor
had
they
horn
-
works
,
or
ravelins
before
the
curtin
,
in
his
time
;
 
or
such
a
fosse
as
we
make
with
a
cuvette
in
the
middle
of
it
,
and
with
covered
ways
and
counterscarps
pallisadoed
along
it
,
to
guard
against
a
Coup
de
main
:
 
So
that
the
seven
men
upon
the
tower
were
a
party
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
from
the
Corps
de
Garde
,
set
there
,
not
only
to
look
out
,
but
to
defend
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
could
be
no
more
,
an
'
please
your
Honour
,
than
a
Corporal
's
Guard
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
smiled
inwardly
,
but
not
outwardly
 
the
subject
being
rather
too
serious
,
considering
what
had
happened
,
to
make
a
jest
of
.
 
<EOS>
So
putting
his
pipe
into
his
mouth
,
which
he
had
just
lighted
,
 
he
contented
himself
with
ordering
Trim
to
read
on
.
 
<EOS>
He
read
on
as
follows
:
  
"
To
have
the
fear
of
God
before
our
eyes
,
and
,
in
our
mutual
dealings
with
each
other
,
to
govern
our
actions
by
the
eternal
measures
of
right
and
wrong
:
 
The
first
of
these
will
comprehend
the
duties
of
religion
;
 
the
second
,
those
of
morality
,
which
are
so
inseparably
connected
together
,
that
you
can
not
divide
these
two
tables
,
even
in
imagination
,
(
tho
"
the
attempt
is
often
made
in
practice
)
without
breaking
and
mutually
destroying
them
both
.
  
<EOS>
I
said
the
attempt
is
often
made
;
and
so
it
is
;
 
there
being
nothing
more
common
than
to
see
a
man
who
has
no
sense
at
all
of
religion
,
and
indeed
has
so
much
honesty
as
to
pretend
to
none
,
who
would
take
it
as
the
bitterest
affront
<EOS>
,
should
you
but
hint
at
a
suspicion
of
his
moral
character
,
 
or
imagine
he
was
not
conscientiously
just
and
scrupulous
to
the
uttermost
mite
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
there
is
some
appearance
that
it
is
so
,
 
tho
"
one
is
unwilling
even
to
suspect
the
appearance
of
so
amiable
a
virtue
as
moral
honesty
,
yet
were
we
to
look
into
the
grounds
of
it
,
in
the
present
case
,
I
am
persuaded
we
should
find
little
reason
to
envy
such
a
one
the
honour
of
his
motive
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
him
declaim
as
pompously
as
he
chooses
upon
the
subject
,
it
will
be
found
to
rest
upon
no
better
foundation
than
either
his
interest
,
his
pride
,
his
ease
,
or
some
such
little
and
changeable
passion
as
will
give
us
but
small
dependence
upon
his
actions
in
matters
of
great
distress
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
illustrate
this
by
an
example
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
the
banker
I
deal
with
,
or
the
physician
I
usually
call
in
,
"
  
(
There
is
no
need
,
cried
Dr.
Slop
,
(
waking
)
to
call
in
any
physician
in
this
case
)
 
'
to
be
neither
of
them
men
of
much
religion
:
 
<EOS>
I
hear
them
make
a
jest
of
it
every
day
,
and
treat
all
its
sanctions
with
so
much
scorn
,
as
to
put
the
matter
past
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
Well
;
 
notwithstanding
this
,
I
put
my
fortune
into
the
hands
of
the
one
:
 
and
what
is
dearer
still
to
me
<EOS>
,
I
trust
my
life
to
the
honest
skill
of
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
let
me
examine
what
is
my
reason
for
this
great
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
in
the
first
place
,
I
believe
there
is
no
probability
that
either
of
them
will
employ
the
power
I
put
into
their
hands
to
my
disadvantage
;
 
<EOS>
I
consider
that
honesty
serves
the
purposes
of
this
life
:
 
<EOS>
I
know
their
success
in
the
world
depends
upon
the
fairness
of
their
characters
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
I
'm
persuaded
that
they
can
not
hurt
me
without
hurting
themselves
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
put
it
otherwise
,
namely
,
that
interest
lay
,
for
once
,
on
the
other
side
;
that
a
case
should
happen
,
wherein
the
one
,
without
stain
to
his
reputation
,
could
secrete
my
fortune
,
and
leave
me
naked
in
the
world
;
 
or
that
the
other
could
send
me
out
of
it
,
and
enjoy
an
estate
by
my
death
,

I

out

As

we
can
have
no
dependence
upon

without
religion

so
,
on
the
other
hand

there
is
nothing
better
to
be
expected
from
religion
without
morality
;
nevertheless
,
'
tis
no
prodigy
to
see
a
man
whose
real
moral
character
stands
very
low
,
who
yet
entertains
the
highest
notion
of
himself
in
the
light
of
a
religious
man

<EOS>
"
He
shall
not
only
be
covetous
,
revengeful
,
implacable
,

even
wanting
in
points
of
common
honesty
;

aloud
against

infidelity
of

is
zealous
for

goes
twice
a

amuses
himself

few
instrumental
parts
of

shall
cheat
his
conscience
into
a
judgment
,
that
,
for
this
,
he
is
a
religious
man

and
has
discharged
truly
his
duty
to
God
:
And
you
will
find
that
such
a
man

through

of
this

generally
looks
down
with
spiritual
pride

ten

to

such
a

the
spirit

tis
the
short
and
decisive
rule

"
First
,
Whenever
a
man
talks
loudly
against
religion
,
always
suspect
that
it
is
not
his
reason
,
but
his
passions
,
which
have
got
the
better
of
his
Creed
.
 
<EOS>
A
bad
life
and
a
good
belief
are
disagreeable
and
troublesome
neighbours
,
and
where
they
separate
,
depend
upon
it
,
'
tis
for
no
other
cause
but
quietness
sake
.
  
<EOS>
"
Secondly
,
When
a
man
,
thus
represented
,
tells
you
in
any
particular
instance
,
 
That
such
a
thing
goes
against
his
conscience
<EOS>
,
 
always
believe
he
means
exactly
the
same
thing
,
as
when
he
tells
you
such
a
thing
goes
against
his
stomach
;
 
a
present
want
of
appetite
being
generally
the
true
cause
of
both
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
a
word
,
 
trust
that
man
in
nothing
,
who
has
not
a
Conscience
in
every
thing
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
,
in
your
own
case
,
remember
this
plain
distinction
,
a
mistake
in
which
has
ruined
thousands
,
 
that
your
conscience
is
not
a
law
;
 
No
,
God
and
reason
made
the
law
,
and
have
placed
conscience
within
you
to
determine
;
  
not
,
like
an
Asiatic
Cadi
,
according
to
the
ebbs
and
flows
of
his
own
passions
,
 
but
like
a
British
judge
in
this
land
of
liberty
and
good
sense
,
who
makes
no
new
law
,
but
faithfully
declares
that
law
which
he
knows
already
written

Thou
hast
read
the
sermon

well

Trim
,
quoth
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
had
spared
his
comments
,
replied
Dr.
Slop
,
 
he
would
have
read
it
much
better
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
read
it
ten
times
better
,
Sir
,
answered
Trim
,
but
that
my
heart
was
so
full
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
the
very
reason
,
Trim
,
replied
my
father
,
which
has
made
thee
read
the
sermon
as
well
as
thou
hast
done
;
and
if
the
clergy
of
our
church
,
continued
my
father
,
addressing
himself
to
Dr.
Slop
,
would
take
part
in
what
they
deliver
as
deeply
as
this
poor
fellow
has
done
,
 
as
their
compositions
are
fine
;
 
<EOS>
(
I
deny
it
,
quoth
Dr.
Slop
)
 
<EOS>
I
maintain
it
,
 
that
the
eloquence
of
our
pulpits
,
with
such
subjects
to
enflame
it
,
would
be
a
model
for
the
whole
world
:
 
<EOS>
But
alas
!
<EOS>
continued
my
father
,
and
I
own
it
,
Sir
,
with
sorrow
,
that
,
like
French
politicians
in
this
respect
,
what
they
gain
in
the
cabinet
they
lose
in
the
field
.
 
<EOS>
'
Twere
a
pity
,
quoth
my
uncle

that
this
should
be
lost
.
 
<EOS>
I
like
the
sermon
well
,
replied
my
father
,
 
'
tis
dramatick
,
 
and
there
is
something
in
that
way
of
writing
,
when
skilfully
managed
,
which
catches
the
attention
.
 
<EOS>
We
preach
much
in
that
way
with
us
,
said
Dr.
Slop
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
very
well
,
said
my
father
,
 
<EOS>
but
in
a
tone
and
manner
which
disgusted
Dr.
Slop
,
full
as
much
as
his
assent
,
simply
,
could
have
pleased
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
this
,
added
Dr.
Slop
,
a
little
piqued
,
 
our
sermons
have
greatly
the
advantage
,
that
we
never
introduce
any
character
into
them
below
a
patriarch
or
a
patriarch
's
wife
,
or
a
martyr
or
a
saint
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
some
very
bad
characters
in
this
,
however
,
said
my
father
,
and
I
do
not
think
the
sermon
a
jot
the
worse
for
'em
.
 
<EOS>
But
pray
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
 
who
's
can
this
be
?
 
<EOS>
How
could
it
get
into
my
Stevinus
?
 
<EOS>
A
man
must
be
as
great
a
conjurer
as
Stevinus
,
said
my
father
,
to
resolve
the
second
question
:
 
<EOS>
The
first
,
I
think
,
is
not
so
difficult
;
 
for
unless
my
judgment
greatly
deceives

<EOS>
I
know
the
author
,
for

tis
wrote

certainly
,
by
the
parson
of
the
parish
.
  
<EOS>
The
similitude
of
the
stile
and
manner
of
it
,
with
those
my
father
constantly
had
heard
preached
in
his
parish
-
church
,
was
the
ground
of
his
conjecture
,
 
proving
it
as
strongly
,
as
an
argument
<EOS>
a
priori
could
prove
such
a
thing
to
a
philosophic
mind
,
That
it
was
Yorick
's
and
no
one
's
else
:
 
<EOS>
It
was
proved
to
be
so
,
a
posteriori
,
the
day
after
,
when
Yorick
sent
a
servant
to
my
uncle
Toby
's
house
to
enquire
after
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
seems
that
Yorick
,
who
was
inquisitive
after
all
kinds
of
knowledge
,
had
borrowed
Stevinus
of
my
uncle
Toby
,
and
had
carelesly
popped
his
sermon
,
as
soon
as
he
had
made
it
,
into
the
middle
of
Stevinus
;
and
by
an
act
of
forgetfulness
,
to
which
he
was
ever
subject
,
he
had
sent
Stevinus
home
,
and
his
sermon
to
keep
him
company
.
  
<EOS>
Ill
-
fated
sermon
!
 
<EOS>
Thou
wast
lost
,
after
this
recovery
of
thee
,
a
second
time
,
dropped
thru
'
an
unsuspected
fissure
in
thy
master
's
pocket
,
down
into
a
treacherous
and
a
tattered
lining
,
 
trod
deep
into
the
dirt
by
the
left
hind
-
foot
of
his
Rosinante
inhumanly
stepping
upon
thee
as
thou
falledst
;
 
buried
ten
days
in
the
mire
,
 
raised
up
out
of
it
by
a
beggar
,
  
sold
for
a
halfpenny
to
a
parish
-
clerk
,
 
transferred
to
his
parson
,
 
lost
for
ever
to
thy
own
,
the
remainder
of
his
days
,
 
nor
restored
to
his
restless
Manes
till
this
very
moment
,
that
I
tell
the
world
the
story
.
  
<EOS>
Can
the
reader
believe
,
that
this
sermon
of
Yorick
's
was
preached
at
an
assize
,
in
the
cathedral
of
York
,
before
a
thousand
witnesses
,
ready
to
give
oath
of
it
,
by
a
certain
prebendary
of
that
church
,
and
actually
printed
by
him
when
he
had
done
,
 
and
within
so
short
a
space
as
two
years
and
three
months
after
Yorick
's
death
?
 
<EOS>
Yorick
indeed
,
was
never
better
served
in
his
life
;
 
but
it
was
a
little
hard
to
maltreat
him
after
,
and
plunder
him
after
he
was
laid
in
his
grave
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
as
the
gentleman
who
did
it
was
in
perfect
charity
with
Yorick
,
  
and
,
in
conscious
justice
,
printed
but
a
few
copies
to
give
away
;
 
and
that
I
am
told
he
could
moreover
have
made
as
good
a
one
himself
,
had
he
thought
fit
,
 
I
declare
I
would
not
have
published
this
anecdote
to
the
world
;
 
nor
do
I
publish
it
with
an
intent
to
hurt
his
character
and
advancement
in
the
church
;
 
<EOS>
I
leave
that
to
others
;
 
but
I
find
myself
impelled
by
two
reasons
,
which
I
can
not
withstand
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
is
,
That
in
doing
justice
,
I
may
give
rest
to
Yorick
's
ghost
;
  
which
 
as
the
country
-
people
,
and
some
others
believe
,
 
still
walks
.
  
<EOS>
The
second
reason
is
,
That
,
by
laying
open
this
story
to
the
world
,
I
gain
an
opportunity
of
informing
it
,
 
That
in
case
the
character
of
parson
Yorick
,
and
this
sample
of
his
sermons
,
is
liked
,
 
there
are
now
in
the
possession
of
the
Shandy
family
,
as
many
as
will
make
a
handsome
volume
,
at
the
world
's
service
,
 
and
much
good
<EOS>
may
they
do
it
.
    
<EOS>
Obadiah
gained
the
two
crowns
without
dispute
;
 
for
he
came
in
jingling
,
with
all
the
instruments
in
the
green
baize
bag
we
spoke
of
,
flung
across
his
body
,
just
as
Corporal
Trim
went
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
now
proper
,
I
think
,
quoth
Dr.
Slop
,
(
clearing
up
his
looks
)
as
we
are
in
a
condition
to
be
of
some
service
to
Mrs.
Shandy
,
to
send
up
stairs
to
know
how
she
goes
on
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
ordered
,
answered
my
father
,
the
old
midwife
to
come
down
to
us
upon
the
least
difficulty
;
 
<EOS>
for
you
must
know
,
Dr.
Slop
,
continued
my
father
,
with
a
perplexed
kind
of
a
smile
upon
his
countenance
,
that
by
express
treaty
,
solemnly
ratified
between
me
and
my
wife
,
you
are
no
more
than
an
auxiliary
in
this
affair
,
 
and
not
so
much
as
that
,
 
unless
the
lean
old
mother
of
a
midwife
above
stairs
can
not
do
without
you
.
 
<EOS>
Women
have
their
particular
fancies
,
and
in
points
of
this
nature
,
continued
my
father
,
where
they
bear
the
whole
burden
,
and
suffer
so
much
acute
pain
for
the
advantage
of
our
families
,
and
the
good
of
the
species
,
 
they
claim
a
right
of
deciding
,
en
Souveraines
,
in
whose
hands
,
and
in
what
fashion
,
they
choose
to
undergo
it
.
  
<EOS>
They
are
in
the
right
of
it
,
 
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
But
Sir
,
replied
Dr.
Slop
,
not
taking
notice
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
opinion
,
but
turning
to
my
father
,
 
they
had
better
govern
in
other
points
;
 
and
a
father
of
a
family
,
who
wishes
its
perpetuity
,
in
my
opinion
,
had
better
exchange
this
prerogative
with
them
,
and
give
up
some
other
rights
in
lieu
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
father
,
answering
a
letter
too
testily
,
to
be
quite
dispassionate
in
what
he
said
,
 
I
know
not
,
quoth
<EOS>
he
,
what
we
have
left
to
give
up
,
in
lieu
of
who
shall
bring
our
children
into
the
world
,
unless
that
,
 
of
who
shall
beget
them
.
 
<EOS>
One
would
almost
give
up
any
thing
,
replied
Dr.
Slop
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
,
 
answered
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
replied
Dr.
Slop
,
it
would
astonish
you
to
know
what
improvements
we
have
made
of
late
years
in
all
branches
of
obstetrical
knowledge
,
but
particularly
in
that
one
single
point
of
the
safe
and
expeditious
extraction
of
the
foetus
,
 
which
has
received
such
lights
,
that
,
for
my
part
(
holding
up
his
hand
)
<EOS>
I
declare
I
wonder
how
the
world
has
 
I
wish
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
you
had
seen
what
prodigious
armies
we
had
in
Flanders
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
dropped
the
curtain
over
this
scene
for
a
minute
,
 
to
remind
you
of
one
thing
,
 
and
to
inform
you
of
another
.
  
<EOS>
What
I
have
to
inform
you
,
comes
,
I
own
,
a
little
out
of
its
due
course
;
  
for
it
should
have
been
told
a
hundred
and
fifty
pages
ago
,
but
<EOS>
that
I
foresaw
then
"
twould
come
in
pat
hereafter
,
and
be
of
more
advantage
here
than
elsewhere
.
 
<EOS>
Writers
had
need
look
before
them
,
to
keep
up
the
spirit
and
connection
of
what
they
have
in
hand
.
  
<EOS>
When
these
two
things
are
done
,
 
the
curtain
shall
be
drawn
up
again
,
and
my
uncle
Toby
,
my
father
,
and
Dr.
Slop
,
shall
go
on
with
their
discourse
,
without
any
more
interruption
.
  
<EOS>
First
,
then
,
the
matter
which
I
have
to
remind
you
of
,
is
this
;
 
that
from
the
specimens
of
singularity
in
my
father
's
notions
in
the
point
of
Christian
-
names
,
and
that
other
previous
point
thereto
,
 
you
was
led
,
I
think
,
into
an
opinion
,
 
(
and
I
am
sure
I
said
as
much
)
that
my
father
was
a
gentleman
altogether
as
odd
and
whimsical
in
fifty
other
opinions
.
 
<EOS>
In
truth
,
there
was
not
a
stage
in
the
life
of
man
,
from
the
very
first
act
of
his
begetting
,
 
down
to
the
lean
and
slippered
pantaloon
in
his
second
childishness
,
but
he
had
some
favourite
notion
to
himself
,
springing
out
of
it
,
as
sceptical
,
and
as
far
out
of
the
high
-
way
of
thinking
,
as
these
two
which
have
been
explained
.
    
<EOS>
Mr.
Shandy
,
my
father
,
Sir
,
would
see
nothing
in
the
light
in
which
others
placed
it
;
 
he
placed
things
in
his
own
light
;
 
he
would
weigh
nothing
in
common
scales
;
 
no
,
he
was
too
refined
a
researcher
to
lie
open
to
so
gross
an
imposition
.
 
<EOS>
To
come
at
the
exact
weight
of
things
in
the
scientific
steel
-
yard
,
the
fulcrum
,
he
would
say
,
should
be
almost
invisible
,
to
avoid
all
friction
from
popular
tenets
;
 
without
this
the
minutiae
of
philosophy
,
which
would
always
turn
the
balance
,
will
have
no
weight
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
Knowledge
,
like
matter
,
he
would
affirm
,
was
divisible
in
infinitum
;
 
that
the
grains
and
scruples
were
as
much
a
part
of
it
,
as
the
gravitation
of
the
whole
world
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
he
would
say
,
error
was
error
,
 
no
matter
where
it
fell
,
 
whether
in
a
fraction
,
 
or
a
pound
,
 
'
twas
alike
fatal
to
truth
,
and
she
was
kept
down
at
the
bottom
of
her
well
,
as
inevitably
by
a
mistake
in
the
dust
of
a
butterfly
's
wing
,
 
as
in
the
disk
of
the
sun
,
the
moon
,
and
all
the
stars
of
heaven
put
together
.
  
<EOS>
He
would
often
lament
that
it
was
for
want
of
considering
this
properly
,
and
of
applying
it
skilfully
to
civil
matters
,
as
well
as
to
speculative
truths
,
that
so
many
things
in
this
world
were
out
of
joint
;
 
that
the
political
arch
was
giving
way
;
 
and
that
the
very
foundations
of
our
excellent
constitution
in
church
and
state
,
were
so
sapped
as
estimators
had
reported
.
  
<EOS>
You
cry
out
,
he
would
say
,
we
are
a
ruined
,
undone
people
.
 
<EOS>
Why
?
<EOS>
he
would
ask
,
making
use
of
the
sorites
or
syllogism
of
Zeno
and
Chrysippus
,
without
knowing
it
belonged
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
Why
?
<EOS>
why
are
we
a
ruined
people
?
 
<EOS>
Because
we
are
corrupted
.
 
<EOS>
Whence
is
it
,
<EOS>
dear
Sir
,
that
we
are
corrupted
?
 
<EOS>
Because
we
are
needy
;
 
our
poverty
,
and
not
our
wills
,
consent
.
 
<EOS>
And
wherefore
,
he
would
add
,
are
we
needy
?
 
<EOS>
From
the
neglect
,
he
would
answer
,
of
our
pence
and
our
halfpence
:
 
<EOS>
Our
bank
notes
,
Sir
,
our
guineas
,
 
nay
our
shillings
take
care
of
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
<EOS>
the
same
,
he
would
say
,
throughout
the
whole
circle
of
the
sciences
;
  
the
great
,
the
established
points
of
them
,
are
not
to
be
broke
in
upon
.
  
<EOS>
The
laws
of
nature
will
defend
themselves
;
 
but
error
 
<EOS>
(
he
would
add
,
looking
earnestly
at
my
mother
)
 
error
,
Sir
,
creeps
in
thro
"
the
minute
holes
and
small
crevices
which
human
nature
leaves
unguarded
.
  
<EOS>
This
turn
of
thinking
in
my
father
,
is
what
I
had
to
remind
you
of
:
 
<EOS>
The
point
you
are
to
be
informed
of
,
and
which
I
have
reserved
for
this
place
,
is
as
follows
.
  
<EOS>
Amongst
the
many
and
excellent
reasons
,
with
which
my
father
had
urged
my
mother
to
accept
of
Dr.
Slop
's
assistance
preferably
to
that
of
the
old
woman
,
 
there
was
one
of
a
very
singular
nature
;
which
,
when
he
had
done
arguing
the
matter
with
her
as
a
Christian
,
and
came
to
argue
it
over
again
with
her
as
a
philosopher
,
he
had
put
his
whole
strength
to
,
depending
indeed
upon
it
as
his
sheet
-
anchor
.
 
<EOS>
It
failed
him
,
tho
'
from
no
defect
in
the
argument
itself
;
but
that
,
do
what
he
could
,
he
was
not
able
for
his
soul
to
make
her
comprehend
the
drift
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Cursed
luck
!
 
<EOS>
said
he
to
himself
,
one
afternoon
,
as
he
walked
out
of
the
room
,
after
he
had
been
stating
it
for
an
hour
and
a
half
to
her
,
to
no
manner
of
purpose
;
 
cursed
luck
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
biting
his
lip
as
he
shut
the
door
,
 
for
a
man
to
be
master
of
one
of
the
finest
chains
of
reasoning
in
nature
,
 
and
have
a
wife
at
the
same
time
with
such
a
head
-
piece
,
that
he
can
not
hang
up
a
single
inference
within
side
of
it
,
to
save
his
soul
from
destruction
.
  
<EOS>
This
argument
,
though
it
was
entirely
lost
upon
my
mother
,
 
had
more
weight
with
him
,
than
all
his
other
arguments
joined
together
:
 
I
will
therefore
endeavour
to
do
it
justice
,
 
and
set
it
forth
with
all
the
perspicuity
I
am
master
of
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
set
out
upon
the
strength
of
these
two
following
axioms
:
  
<EOS>
First
,
That
an
ounce
of
a
man
's
own
wit
,
was
worth
a
ton
of
other
people
's
;
and
,
  
Secondly
,
(
Which
by
the
bye
,
was
the
ground
-
work
of
the
first
axiom
,
 
tho
'
<EOS>
it
comes
last
)
That
every
man
's
wit
must
come
from
every
man
's
own
soul
,
  
and
no
other
body
's
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
as
it
was
plain
to
my
father
,
that
all
souls
were
by
nature
equal
,
  
and
that
the
great
difference
between
the
most
acute
and
the
most
obtuse
understanding
 
was
from
no
original
sharpness
or
bluntness
of
one
thinking
substance
above
or
below
another
,
 
but
arose
merely
from
the
lucky
or
unlucky
organization
of
the
body
,
in
that
part
where
the
soul
principally
took
up
her
residence
,
 
he
had
made
it
the
subject
of
his
enquiry
to
find
out
the
identical
place
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
from
the
best
accounts
he
had
been
able
to
get
of
this
matter
,
he
was
satisfied
it
could
not
be
where
Des
Cartes
had
fixed
it
,
upon
the
top
of
the
pineal
gland
of
the
brain
;
which
,
as
he
philosophized
,
formed
a
cushion
for
her
about
the
size
of
a
marrow
pea
;
tho
'
to
speak
the
truth
,
as
so
many
nerves
did
terminate
all
in
that
one
place
,
 
'
twas
no
bad
conjecture
;
 
and
my
father
had
certainly
fallen
with
that
great
philosopher
plumb
into
the
centre
of
the
mistake
,
had
it
not
been
for
my
uncle
Toby
,
who
rescued
him
out
of
it
,
by
a
story
he
told
him
of
a
Walloon
officer
at
the
battle
of
Landen
,
who
had
one
part
of
his
brain
shot
away
by
a
musket
-
ball
,
 
and
another
part
of
it
taken
out
after
by
a
French
surgeon
;
and
after
all
,
recovered
,
and
did
his
duty
very
well
without
it
.
  
<EOS>
If
death
,
said
my
father
,
reasoning
with
himself
,
is
nothing
but
the
separation
of
the
soul
from
the
body
;
 
and
if
it
is
true
that
people
can
walk
about
and
do
their
business
without
brains
,
 
then
certes
the
soul
does
not
inhabit
there
.
 
<EOS>
Q.E.D.
  
<EOS>
As
for
that
certain
,
very
thin
,
subtle
and
very
fragrant
juice
which
Coglionissimo
Borri
,
the
great
Milaneze
physician
affirms
,
in
a
letter
to
Bartholine
,
to
have
discovered
in
the
cellulae
of
the
occipital
parts
of
the
cerebellum
,
and
which
he
likewise
affirms
to
be
the
principal
seat
of
the
reasonable
soul
,
(
for
,
you
must
know
,
in
these
latter
and
more
enlightened
ages
,
there
are
two
souls
in
every
man
living
,
 
the
one
,
according
to
the
great
Metheglingius
,
being
called
the
Animus
,
the
other
,
the
Anima
;
)
 
as
for
the
opinion
<EOS>
,
I
say
of
Borri
,
 
my
father
could
never
subscribe
to
it
by
any
means
;
<EOS>
the
very
idea
of
so
noble
,
so
refined
,
so
immaterial
,
and
so
exalted
a
being
as
the
Anima
,
or
even
the
Animus
,
taking
up
her
residence
,
and
sitting
dabbling
,
like
a
tad
-
pole
all
day
long
,
both
summer
and
winter
,
in
a
puddle
,
 
or
in
a
liquid
of
any
kind
,
how
thick
or
thin
soever
,
he
would
say
,
shocked
his
imagination
;
he
would
scarce
give
the
doctrine
a
hearing
.
  
<EOS>
What
,
therefore
,
seemed
the
least
liable
to
objections
of
any
,
was
that
the
chief
sensorium
,
or
head
-
quarters
of
the
soul
,
and
to
which
place
all
intelligences
were
referred
,
and
from
whence
all
her
mandates
were
issued
,
 
was
in
,
or
near
,
the
cerebellum
,
 
or
rather
somewhere
about
the
medulla
oblongata
<EOS>
,
wherein
it
was
generally
agreed
by
Dutch
anatomists
,
that
all
the
minute
nerves
from
all
the
organs
of
the
seven
senses
concentered
,
like
streets
and
winding
alleys
,
into
a
square
.
  
<EOS>
So
far
there
was
nothing
singular
in
my
father
's
opinion
,
 
<EOS>
he
had
the
best
of
philosophers
,
of
all
ages
and
climates
,
to
go
along
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
here
he
took
a
road
of
his
own
,
setting
up
another
Shandean
hypothesis
upon
these
corner
-
stones
they
had
laid
for
him
;
 
and
which
said
hypothesis
equally
stood
its
ground
;
whether
the
subtilty
and
fineness
of
the
soul
depended
upon
the
temperature
and
clearness
of
the
said
liquor
,
or
of
the
finer
net
-
work
and
texture
in
the
cerebellum
itself
;
which
opinion
he
favoured
.
  
<EOS>
He
maintained
,
that
next
to
the
due
care
to
be
taken
in
the
act
of
propagation
of
each
individual
,
which
required
all
the
thought
in
the
world
,
as
it
laid
the
foundation
of
this
incomprehensible
contexture
,
in
which
wit
,
memory
,
fancy
,
eloquence
,
and
what
is
usually
meant
by
the
name
of
good
natural
parts
,
do
consist
;
 
that
next
to
this
and
his
Christian-
name
,
which
were
the
two
original
and
most
efficacious
causes
of
all
;
 
that
the
third
cause
,
or
<EOS>
rather
what
logicians
call
the
Causa
sina
qua
non
,
and
without
which
all
that
was
done
was
of
no
manner
of
significance
<EOS>
,
 
was
the
preservation
of
this
delicate
and
fine
-
spun
web
,
from
the
havock
which
was
generally
made
in
it
by
the
violent
compression
and
crush
which
the
head
was
made
to
undergo
,
by
the
nonsensical
method
of
bringing
us
into
the
world
by
that
foremost
.
    
<EOS>
This
requires
explanation
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
,
who
dipped
into
all
kinds
of
books
,
upon
looking
into
Lithopaedus
Senonesis
de
Portu
difficili
,
(
The
author
is
here
twice
mistaken
;
for
Lithopaedus
should
be
wrote
thus
,
Lithopaedii
Senonensis
Icon
.
 
<EOS>
The
second
mistake
is
,
that
this
Lithopaedus
is
not
an
author
,
but
a
drawing
of
a
petrified
child
.
 
<EOS>
The
account
of
this
,
published
by
Athosius
1580
,
may
be
seen
at
the
end
of
Cordaeus
's
works
in
Spachius
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Tristram
Shandy
has
been
led
into
this
error
,
either
from
seeing
Lithopaedus
's
name
of
late
in
a
catalogue
of
learned
writers
in
Dr.
.
.
,
or
by
mistaking
Lithopaedus
for
Trinecavellius
,
 
from
the
too
great
similitude
of
the
names
.
)
<EOS>
published
by
Adrianus
Smelvgot
,
had
found
out
,
that
the
lax
and
pliable
state
of
a
child
's
head
in
parturition
,
the
bones
of
the
cranium
having
no
sutures
at
that
time
,
was
such
,
 
that
by
force
of
the
woman
's
efforts
,
which
,
in
strong
labour
-
pains
,
was
equal
,
upon
an
average
,
to
the
weight
of
470
pounds
avoirdupois
acting
perpendicularly
upon
it
;
 
it
so
happened
,
that
in
49
instances
out
of
50
,
the
said
head
was
compressed
and
moulded
into
the
shape
of
an
oblong
conical
piece
of
dough
,
such
as
a
pastry
-
cook
generally
rolls
up
in
order
to
make
a
pye
of
.
 
<EOS>
Good
God
!
<EOS>
cried
my
father
,
what
havock
and
destruction
must
this
make
in
the
infinitely
fine
and
tender
texture
of
the
cerebellum
!
 
<EOS>
Or
if
there
is
such
a
juice
as
Borri
pretends
 
is
it
not
enough
to
make
the
clearest
liquid
in
the
world
both
seculent
and
mothery
?
  
<EOS>
But
how
great
was
his
apprehension
,
when
he
farther
understood
,
that
this
force
acting
upon
the
very
vertex
of
the
head
,
not
only
injured
the
brain
itself
,
or
cerebrum
,
 
but
that
it
necessarily
squeezed
and
propelled
the
cerebrum
towards
the
cerebellum
,
which
was
the
immediate
seat
of
the
understanding
!
 
<EOS>
Angels
and
ministers
of
grace
defend
us
!
<EOS>
cried
my
father
,
  
<EOS>
can
any
soul
withstand
this
shock
?
 
<EOS>
No
wonder
the
intellectual
web
is
so
rent
and
tattered
as
we
see
it
;
and
that
so
many
of
our
best
heads
are
no
better
than
a
puzzled
skein
of
silk
,
 
all
perplexity
,
 
all
confusion
within
-
side
.
  
<EOS>
But
when
my
father
read
on
,
and
was
let
into
the
secret
,
that
when
a
child
was
turned
topsy
-
turvy
,
which
was
easy
for
an
operator
to
do
,
and
was
extracted
by
the
feet
;
 
that
instead
of
the
cerebrum
being
propelled
towards
the
cerebellum
,
the
cerebellum
,
on
the
contrary
,
was
propelled
simply
towards
the
cerebrum
,
where
it
could
do
no
manner
of
hurt
:
 
By
heavens
!
<EOS>
cried
he
,
the
world
is
in
conspiracy
to
drive
out
what
little
wit
God
has
given
us
,
 
and
the
professors
of
the
obstetric
art
are
listed
into
the
same
conspiracy
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
it
to
me
<EOS>
which
end
of
my
son
comes
foremost
into
the
world
,
provided
all
goes
right
after
,
and
his
cerebellum
escapes
uncrushed
?
  
<EOS>
It
is
the
nature
of
an
hypothesis
,
when
once
a
man
has
conceived
it
,
that
it
assimilates
every
thing
to
itself
,
as
proper
nourishment
;
and
,
from
the
first
moment
of
your
begetting
it
,
it
generally
grows
the
stronger
by
every
thing
you
see
,
hear
,
read
,
or
understand
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
of
great
use
.
  
<EOS>
When
my
father
was
gone
with
this
about
a
month
,
there
was
scarce
a
phaenomenon
of
stupidity
or
of
genius
,
which
he
could
not
readily
solve
by
it
;
 
it
accounted
for
the
eldest
son
being
the
greatest
blockhead
in
the
family
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
devil
,
he
would
say
,
 
he
made
way
for
the
capacity
of
his
younger
brothers
.
 
<EOS>
It
unriddled
the
observations
of
drivellers
and
monstrous
heads
,
 
shewing
a
priori
,
it
could
not
be
otherwise
,
 
unless
.
.
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
.
 
<EOS>
It
wonderfully
explained
and
accounted
for
the
acumen
of
the
Asiatic
genius
,
and
that
sprightlier
turn
,
and
a
more
penetrating
intuition
of
minds
,
in
warmer
climates
;
not
from
the
loose
and
common
-
place
solution
of
a
clearer
sky
,
and
a
more
perpetual
sunshine
,
&
c.
 
which
for
aught
he
knew
,
might
as
well
rarefy
and
dilute
the
faculties
of
the
soul
into
nothing
,
by
one
extreme
,
 
as
they
are
condensed
in
colder
climates
by
the
other
;
 
but
he
traced
the
affair
up
to
its
spring
-
head
;
 
shewed
that
,
in
warmer
climates
,
nature
had
laid
a
lighter
tax
upon
the
fairest
parts
of
the
creation
;
 
their
pleasures
more
;
 
the
necessity
of
their
pains
less
,
insomuch
that
the
pressure
and
resistance
upon
the
vertex
was
so
slight
,
that
the
whole
organization
of
the
cerebellum
was
preserved
;
 
nay
,
he
did
not
believe
,
in
natural
births
,
that
so
much
as
a
single
thread
of
the
net-
work
was
broke
or
displaced
,
 
so
that
the
soul
might
just
act
as
she
liked
.
  
<EOS>
When
my
father
had
got
so
far
,
 
what
a
blaze
of
light
did
the
accounts
of
the
Caesarian
section
,
and
of
the
towering
geniuses
who
had
come
safe
into
the
world
by
it
,
cast
upon
this
hypothesis
?
 
<EOS>
Here
you
see
,
he
would
say
,
there
was
no
injury
done
to
the
sensorium
;
 
<EOS>
no
pressure
of
the
head
against
the
pelvis
;
 
no
propulsion
of
the
cerebrum
towards
the
cerebellum
,
either
by
the
os
pubis
on
this
side
,
or
os
coxygis
on
that
;
 
and
pray
,
what
were
the
happy
consequences
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
Sir
,
your
Julius
Caesar
,
who
gave
the
operation
a
name
;
 
and
your
Hermes
Trismegistus
,
who
was
born
so
before
ever
the
operation
had
a
name
;
 
your
Scipio
Africanus
;
your
Manlius
Torquatus
;
our
Edward
the
Sixth
,
 
who
,
had
he
lived
,
would
have
done
the
same
honour
to
the
hypothesis
:
 
These
,
and
many
more
who
figured
high
in
the
annals
of
fame
,
 
all
came
side
-
way
,
Sir
,
into
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
The
incision
of
the
abdomen
and
uterus
ran
for
six
weeks
together
in
my
father
's
head
;
 
he
had
read
,
and
was
satisfied
,
that
wounds
in
the
epigastrium
,
and
those
in
the
matrix
,
were
not
mortal
;
 
so
that
the
belly
of
the
mother
might
be
opened
extremely
well
to
give
a
passage
to
the
child
.
 
<EOS>
He
mentioned
the
thing
one
afternoon
to
my
mother
,
 
merely
as
a
matter
of
fact
;
but
seeing
her
turn
as
pale
as
ashes
at
the
very
mention
of
it
,
as
much
as
the
operation
flattered
his
hopes
,
 
he
thought
it
as
well
to
say
no
more
of
it
,
 
contenting
himself
with
admiring
,
 
what
he
thought
was
to
no
purpose
to
propose
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
my
father
Mr.
Shandy
's
hypothesis
;
concerning
which
I
have
only
to
add
,
that
my
brother
Bobby
did
as
great
honour
to
it
(
whatever
he
did
to
the
family
)
as
any
one
of
the
great
heroes
we
spoke
of
:
 
<EOS>
For
happening
not
only
to
be
christened
,
as
I
told
you
,
but
to
be
born
too
,
when
my
father
was
at
Epsom
,
 
being
moreover
my
mother
's
first
child
,
 
coming
into
the
world
with
his
head
foremost
,
 
and
turning
out
afterwards
a
lad
of
wonderful
slow
parts
,
 
my
father
spelt
all
these
together
into
his
opinion
:
 
and
as
he
had
failed
at
one
end
,
 
he
was
determined
to
try
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
not
to
be
expected
from
one
of
the
sisterhood
,
who
are
not
easily
to
be
put
out
of
their
way
,
 
and
was
therefore
one
of
my
father
's
great
reasons
in
favour
of
a
man
of
science
,
whom
he
could
better
deal
with
.
  
<EOS>
Of
all
men
in
the
world
,
Dr.
Slop
was
the
fittest
for
my
father
's
purpose
;
 
for
though
this
new
-
invented
forceps
was
the
armour
he
had
proved
,
and
what
he
maintained
to
be
the
safest
instrument
of
deliverance
,
yet
,
it
seems
,
he
had
scattered
a
word
or
two
in
his
book
,
in
favour
of
the
very
thing
which
ran
in
my
father
's
fancy
;
 
tho
'
not
with
a
view
to
the
soul
's
good
in
extracting
by
the
feet
,
as
was
my
father
's
system
,
 
<EOS>
but
for
reasons
merely
obstetrical
.
  
<EOS>
This
will
account
for
the
coalition
betwixt
my
father
and
Dr.
Slop
,
in
the
ensuing
discourse
,
which
went
a
little
hard
against
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
In
what
manner
a
plain
man
,
with
nothing
but
common
sense
,
could
bear
up
against
two
such
allies
in
science
,
 
is
hard
to
conceive
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
conjecture
upon
it
,
if
you
please
,
 
and
whilst
<EOS>
your
imagination
is
in
motion
,
you
may
encourage
it
to
go
on
,
and
discover
by
what
causes
and
effects
in
nature
<EOS>
it
could
come
to
pass
,
that
my
uncle
Toby
got
his
modesty
by
the
wound
he
received
upon
his
groin
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
raise
a
system
to
account
for
the
loss
of
my
nose
by
marriage
-
articles
,
 
and
shew
the
world
how
it
could
happen
,
that
I
should
have
the
misfortune
to
be
called
Tristram
,
in
opposition
to
my
father
's
hypothesis
,
and
the
wish
of
the
whole
family
,
Godfathers
and
Godmothers
not
excepted
.
 
<EOS>
These
,
with
fifty
other
points
left
yet
unravelled
,
you
may
endeavour
to
solve
if
you
have
time
;
 
but
I
tell
you
beforehand
it
will
be
in
vain
,
for
not
the
sage
Alquise
,
the
magician
in
Don
Belianis
of
Greece
,
nor
the
no
less
famous
Urganda
,
the
sorceress
his
wife

(
were
they
alive

could
pretend
to
come
within
a
league
of
the
truth

"
I
wish
,
Dr.
Slop

quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
(
repeating
his
wish
for
Dr.
Slop
a
second
time
,
and
with
a
degree
of
more
zeal
and
earnestness
in
his
manner
of
wishing

he
had
wished
at
first

Dr.

quoth
my

you

seen
what
prodigious

we

Flanders

"
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
's
wish
did
Dr.
Slop
a
disservice
which
his
heart
never
intended
any
man
,
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
it
confounded
him
 
and
thereby
putting
his
ideas
first
into
confusion
,
and
then
to
flight
,
he
could
not
rally
them
again
for
the
soul
of
him

In
all
disputes
,
 
male
or
female
,
 
whether
for
honour
,
for
profit
,
or
for
love
,
 
it
makes
no
difference
in
the
case
;
 
nothing
is
more
dangerous
,
<EOS>
Madam
,
than
a
wish
coming
sideways
in
this
unexpected
manner
upon
a
man
:
 
the
safest
way
in
general
to
take
off
the
force
of
the
wish
,
is
for
the
party
<EOS>
wish'd
at
,
instantly
to
get
upon
his
legs
 
and
wish
the
wisher
something
in
return
,
of
pretty
near
the
same
value
,
 
so
balancing
the
account
upon
the
spot
,
you
stand
as
you
were
 
<EOS>
nay
sometimes
gain
the
advantage
of
the
attack
by
it
.
  
<EOS>
This
will
be
fully
illustrated
to
the
world
in
my
chapter
of
wishes
.
    
<EOS>
Dr.
Slop
did
not
understand
the
nature
of
this
defence
;
 
he
was
puzzled
with
it
,
and
it
put
an
entire
stop
to
the
dispute
for
four
minutes
and
a
half
;
 
five
had
been
fatal
to
it
:
 
<EOS>
my
father
saw
the
danger
 
<EOS>
the
dispute
was
one
of
the
most
interesting
disputes
in
the
world
,
"
Whether
the
child
of
his
prayers
and
endeavours
should
be
born
without
a
head
or
with
one
:
"
  
he
waited
to
the
last
moment
,
to
allow
Dr.
Slop
,
in
whose
behalf
the
wish
was
made
,
his
right
of
returning
it
;
but
perceiving
,
I
say
,
that
he
was
confounded
,
and
continued
looking
with
that
perplexed
vacuity
of
eye
which
puzzled
souls
generally
stare
with
 
first
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
face
 
then
in
his
 
then
up
 
then
down
 
then
east
 
east
and
by
east
,
and
so
on
,
 
coasting
it
along
by
the
plinth
of
the
wainscot
till
he
had
got
to
the
opposite
point
of
the
compass
,
 
and
that
he
had
actually
begun
to
count
the
brass
nails
upon
the
arm
of
his
chair
,
 
my
father
thought
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
with
my
uncle
Toby
,
so
took
up
the
discourse
as
follows
.
    
<EOS>
"
 
What
prodigious
armies
you
had
in
Flanders
!
"
    
<EOS>
Brother
Toby
,
replied
my
father
,
taking
his
wig
from
off
his
head
with
his
right
hand
,
and
with
his
left
pulling
out
a
striped
India
handkerchief
from
his
right
coat
pocket
,
in
order
to
rub
his
head
,
as
he
argued
the
point
with
my
uncle
Toby
.
      
<EOS>
Now
,
in
this
I
think
my
father
was
much
to
blame
;
and
I
will
give
you
my
reasons
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
Matters
of
no
more
seeming
consequence
in
themselves
than
,
"
Whether
my
father
should
have
taken
off
his
wig
with
his
right
hand
or
with
his
left
,
"
 
have
divided
the
greatest
kingdoms
,
and
made
the
crowns
of
the
monarchs
who
governed
them
,
to
totter
upon
their
heads
.
 
<EOS>
But
need
I
tell
you
,
Sir
,
that
the
circumstances
with
which
every
thing
in
this
world
is
begirt
,
give
every
thing
in
this
world
its
size
and
shape
!
 
<EOS>
and
by
tightening
it
,
or
relaxing
it
,
this
way
or
that
,
make
the
thing
to
be
,
what
it
is
 
great
 
<EOS>
little
 
good
 
<EOS>
bad
 
indifferent
or
not
indifferent
,
just
as
the
case
happens
?
  
<EOS>
As
my
father
's
India
handkerchief
was
in
his
right
coat
pocket
,
he
should
by
no
means
have
suffered
his
right
hand
to
have
got
engaged
:
 
on
the
contrary
,
instead
of
taking
off
his
wig
with
it
,
as
he
did
,
he
ought
to
have
committed
that
entirely
to
the
left
;
and
then
,
when
the
natural
exigency
my
father
was
under
of
rubbing
his
head
,
called
out
for
his
handkerchief
,
he
would
have
had
nothing
in
the
world
to
have
done
,
but
to
have
put
his
right
hand
into
his
right
coat
pocket
and
taken
it
out
;
 
which
he
might
have
done
without
any
violence
,
or
the
least
ungraceful
twist
in
any
one
tendon
or
muscle
of
his
whole
body
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
case
,
(
unless
,
indeed
,
my
father
had
been
resolved
to
make
a
fool
of
himself
by
holding
the
wig
stiff
in
his
left
hand
 
or
by
making
some
nonsensical
angle
or
other
at
his
elbow
-
joint
,
or
armpit
)
 
<EOS>
his
whole
attitude
had
been
easy
 
natural
 
unforced
:
 
Reynolds
himself
,
as
great
and
gracefully
as
he
paints
,
might
have
painted
him
as
he
sat
.
  
<EOS>
Now
as
my
father
managed
this
matter
,
 
consider
what
a
devil
of
a
figure
my
father
made
of
himself
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
latter
end
of
Queen
Anne
's
reign
,
and
in
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
King
George
<EOS>
the
first
 
"
Coat
pockets
were
cut
very
low
down
in
the
skirt

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
need
say
no
more
 
<EOS>
the
father
of
mischief
,
had
he
been
hammering
at
it
a
month
,
could
not
have
contrived
a
worse
fashion
for
one
in
my
father
's
situation
.
    
<EOS>
It
was
not
an
easy
matter
in
any
king
's
reign
(
unless
you
were
as
lean
a
subject
as
myself
)
to
have
forced
your
hand
diagonally
,
quite
across
your
whole
body
,
so
as
to
gain
the
bottom
of
your
opposite
coat
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
year
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
eighteen
,
when
this
happened
,
it
was
extremely
difficult
;
so
that
when
my
uncle
Toby
discovered
the
transverse
zig
-
zaggery
of
my
father
's
approaches
towards
it
,
it
instantly
brought
into
his
mind
those
he
had
done
duty
in
,
before
the
gate
of
St.
Nicolas
;
 
the
idea
of
which
drew
off
his
attention
so
intirely
from
the
subject
in
debate
,
that
he
had
got
his
right
hand
to
the
bell
to
ring
up
Trim
to
go
and
fetch
his
map
of
Namur
,
and
his
compasses
and
sector
along
with
it
,
to
measure
the
returning
angles
of
the
traverses
of
that
attack
,
 
but
particularly
of
that
one
,
where
he
received
his
wound
upon
his
groin
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
knit
his
brows
,
and
as
he
knit
them
,
all
the
blood
in
his
body
seemed
to
rush
up
into
his
face
 
my
uncle
Toby
dismounted
immediately
.
    
<EOS>
I
did
not
apprehend
your
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
was
o'horseback
.
      
<EOS>
A
man
's
body
and
his
mind
,
with
the
utmost
reverence
to
both
I
speak
it
,
are
exactly
like
a
jerkin
,
and
a
jerkin
's
lining
;
 
rumple
the
one
,
 
you
rumple
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
one
certain
exception
however
in
this
case
,
and
that
is
,
when
you
are
so
fortunate
a
fellow
,
as
to
have
had
your
jerkin
made
of
gum
-
taffeta
,
and
the
body
-
lining
to
it
of
a
sarcenet
,
or
thin
persian

doubled
and
creased

fretted

fridged
the
outside

all

you
might
have
played

at

not

you
had
done

them

<EOS>
I
believe
in
my
conscience
that
mine
is
made
up
somewhat
after
this
sort
:
  
for
never
poor
jerkin
has
been
tickled
off
at
such
a
rate
as
it
has
been
these
last
nine
months
together
,
 
and
yet
I
declare
,
<EOS>
the
lining
to
it
,
 
as
far
as
I
am
a
judge
of
the
matter
<EOS>

is
not

back

side

long

way

have
they
been
trimming
it
for
me
:
 
<EOS>
had
there
been
the
least
gumminess
in
my
lining
,
 
by
heaven

<EOS>
it
had
all

long

been

fretted
to

Brother

I

with
as
good
and
as
upright
a
heart
as
ever
God
created

nor
is
it
thy
fault

if
all
the

have
been

may

can

shall

will

or
ought
to
be
begotten

come
with
their

foremost
into

but
believe
me
,
dear
Toby

the
accidents
which
unavoidably
way
-
lay
them
,
not
only
in
the
article
of
our
begetting
'em
 
<EOS>
though
these
,
in
my
opinion
,
are
well
worth
considering

but
the
dangers
and
difficulties
our
children
are
beset
with
,
after
they
are
got
forth
into
the

,
are
enow
 
<EOS>
little
need
is
there
to
expose
them
to
unnecessary
ones
in
their
passage
to
it

<EOS>
Are
these
dangers
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
laying
his
hand
upon
my
father

knee
,
and
looking
up
seriously
in
his

for
an
answer
<EOS>

are
these
dangers
greater
now
o'days

brother

than
in
times
past

<EOS>
Brother
Toby
,
answered
my

,
if
a
child
was

fairly
begot

born
alive

healthy

the

did
well

My

Toby
instantly
withdrew
his
hand
from
off
my

knee

reclined
his

gently
back

raised
his

Dr.

,
to
have
heard
him
,
I
am
determined
therefore
to
relate
the
whole
affair
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
When
Dr.
Slop
's
maid
delivered
the
green
baize
bag
with
her
master
's
instruments
in
it
,
to
Obadiah
,
she
very
sensibly
exhorted
him
to
put
his
head
and
one
arm
through
the
strings
,
and
ride
with
<EOS>
it
slung
across
his
body
:
 
so
undoing
the
bow
-
knot
,
to
lengthen
the
strings
for
him
,
without
any
more
ado
,
she
helped
him
on
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
as
this
,
in
some
measure
,
unguarded
the
mouth
of
the
bag
,
lest
any
thing
should
bolt
out
in
galloping
back
,
at
the
speed
Obadiah
threatened
,
they
consulted
to
take
it
off
again
:
 
and
in
the
great
care
and
caution
of
their
hearts
,
they
had
taken
the
two
strings
and
tied
them
close
(
pursing
up
the
mouth
of
the
bag
first
)
with
half
a
dozen
hard
knots
,
each
of
which
Obadiah
,
to
make
all
safe
,
had
twitched
and
drawn
together
with
all
the
strength
of
his
body
.
  
<EOS>
This
answered
all
that
Obadiah
and
the
maid
intended
;
but
was
no
remedy
against
some
evils
which
neither
he
or
she
foresaw
.
 
<EOS>
The
instruments
,
it
seems
,
as
tight
as
the
bag
was
tied
above
,
had
so
much
room
to
play
in
it
,
towards
the
bottom
(
the
shape
of
the
bag
being
conical
)
that
Obadiah
could
not
make
a
trot
of
it
,
but
with
such
a
terrible
jingle
,
what
with
the
tire
tete
,
forceps
,
and
squirt
,
as
would
have
been
enough
,
had
Hymen
been
taking
a
jaunt
that
way
,
to
have
frightened
him
out
of
the
country
;
but
when
Obadiah
accelerated
his
motion
,
and
from
a
plain
trot
assayed
to
prick
his
coach
-
horse
into
a
full
gallop
 
by
Heaven
!
<EOS>
Sir
,
the
jingle
was
incredible
.
  
<EOS>
As
Obadiah
had
a
wife
and
three
children
 
the
turpitude
of
fornication
,
and
the
many
other
political
ill
consequences
of
this
jingling
,
never
once
entered
his
brain
,
 
he
had
however
his
objection
,
which
came
home
to
himself
,
and
weighed
with
him
,
as
it
has
oft
-
times
done
with
the
greatest
patriots
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
poor
fellow
,
Sir
,
was
not
able
to
hear
himself
whistle
.
"
    
<EOS>
As
Obadiah
loved
wind
-
music
preferably
to
all
the
instrumental
music
he
carried
with
him
,
 
he
very
considerately
set
his
imagination
to
work
,
to
contrive
and
to
invent
by
what
means
he
should
put
himself
in
a
condition
of
enjoying
it
.
  
<EOS>
In
all
distresses
(
except
musical
)
where
small
cords
are
wanted
,
nothing
is
so
apt
to
enter
a
man
's
head
as
his
hat
-
band
:
 
<EOS>
the
philosophy
of
this
is
so
near
the
surface
 
<EOS>
I
scorn
to
enter
into
it
.
  
<EOS>
As
Obadiah
's
was
a
mixed
case
 
mark
,
Sirs
,
 
I
say
,
a
mixed
case
;
for
it
was
obstetrical
,
 
scrip
-
tical
,
squirtical
,
papistical
 
and
as
far
as
the
coach-
horse
was
concerned
in
it
,
 
caballistical
 
and
only
partly
musical
;
  
Obadiah
made
no
scruple
of
availing
himself
of
the
first
expedient
which
offered
;
so
taking
hold
of
the
bag
and
instruments
,
and
griping
them
hard
together
with
one
hand
,
and
with
the
finger
and
thumb
of
the
other
putting
the
end
of
the
hat
-
band
betwixt
his
teeth
,
and
then
slipping
his
hand
down
to
the
middle
of
it
,
 
he
tied
and
cross
-
tied
them
all
fast
together
from
one
end
to
the
other
(
as
you
would
cord
a
trunk
)
<EOS>
with
such
a
multiplicity
of
round
-
abouts
and
intricate
cross
turns
,
with
a
hard
knot
at
every
intersection
or
point
where
the
strings
met
,
 
that
Dr.
Slop
must
have
had
three
fifths
of
Job
's
patience
at
least
to
have
unloosed
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
in
my
conscience
,
that
had
Nature
been
in
one
of
her
nimble
moods
,
and
in
humour
for
such
a
contest
 
and
she
and
Dr.
Slop
both
fairly
started
together
 
there
is
no
man
living
which
had
seen
the
bag
with
all
that
Obadiah
had
done
to
it
,
 
and
known
likewise
the
great
speed
the
Goddess
can
make
when
she
thinks
proper
,
who
would
have
had
the
least
doubt
remaining
in
his
mind
 
which
of
the
two
would
have
carried
off
the
prize
.
 
<EOS>
My
mother
,
Madam
,
had
been
delivered
sooner
than
the
green
bag
infallibly
 
at
least
by
twenty
knots

Great
wits
jump
:
for
the
moment
Dr.
Slop
cast
his
eyes
upon
his
bag
(
which
he
had
not
done
till
the
dispute
with
my
uncle
Toby
about
mid
-
wifery
put
him
in
mind
of
it
)
 
<EOS>
the
very
same
thought
occurred
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
God
's
mercy
,
quoth
<EOS>
he
(
to
himself
)
that
Mrs.
Shandy
has
had
so
bad
a
time
of
it
,
 
else
<EOS>
she
might
have
been
brought
to
bed
seven
times
told
,
before
one
half
of
these
knots
could
have
got
untied
.
 
<EOS>
But
here
you
must
distinguish
 
the
thought
floated
only
in
Dr.
Slop
's
mind
,
without
sail
or
ballast
to
it
,
as
a
simple
proposition
;
millions
of
which
,
as
your
worship
knows
,
are
every
day
swimming
quietly
in
the
middle
of
the
thin
juice
of
a
man
's
understanding
,
without
being
carried
backwards
or
forwards
,
till
some
little
gusts
of
passion
or
interest
drive
them
to
one
side
.
  
<EOS>
A
sudden
trampling
in
the
room
above
,
near
my
mother
's
bed
,
did
the
proposition
<EOS>
the
very
service
I
am
speaking
of
.
 
<EOS>
By
all
that
's
unfortunate
,
quoth
Dr.
Slop
,
unless
I
make
haste
,
the
thing
will
actually
befall
me
as
it
is
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
case
of
knots
,
 
by
which
,
in
the
first
place
,
I
would
not
be
understood
to
mean
slip
-
knots
 
because
in
the
course
of
my
life
and
opinions
 
my
opinions
concerning
them
will
come
in
more
properly
when
I
mention
the
catastrophe
of
my
great
uncle
<EOS>
Mr.
Hammond
Shandy
,
 
a
little
man
,
 
but
of
high
fancy
:
 
<EOS>
he
rushed
into
the
duke
of
Monmouth
's
affair
:
  
nor
,
secondly
,
in
this
place
,
do
I
mean
that
particular
species
of
knots
called
bow
-
knots
;
 
there
is
so
little
address
,
or
skill
,
or
patience
required
in
the
unloosing
them
,
that
they
are
below
my
giving
any
opinion
at
all
about
them
.
 
<EOS>
But
by
the
knots
I
am
speaking
of
,
may
it
please
your
reverences
to
believe
,
<EOS>
that
I
mean
good
,
honest
,
devilish
tight
,
hard
knots
,
made
bona
fide
,
as
Obadiah
made
his
;
 
in
which
there
is
no
quibbling
provision
made
by
the
duplication
and
return
of
the
two
ends
of
the
strings
thro
'
the
annulus
or
noose
made
by
the
second
implication
of
them
 
to
get
them
slipp'd
and
undone
by
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
apprehend
me
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
case
of
these
knots
then
,
and
of
the
several
obstructions
,
which
,
may
it
please
your
reverences
,
such
knots
cast
in
our
way
in
getting
through
life
 
<EOS>
every
hasty
man
can
whip
out
his
pen
-
knife
and
cut
through
them
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
Believe
me
,
Sirs
,
the
most
virtuous
way
,
and
which
both
reason
and
conscience
dictate
 
is
to
take
our
teeth
or
our
fingers
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
Dr.
Slop
had
lost
his
teeth
 
his
favourite
instrument
,
by
extracting
in
a
wrong
direction
,
or
by
some
misapplication
of
it
,
unfortunately
slipping
,
he
had
formerly
,
in
a
hard
labour
,
<EOS>
knock'd
out
three
of
the
best
of
them
with
the
handle
of
it
:
 
he
tried
his
fingers
 
alas
;
the
nails
of
his
fingers
and
thumbs
were
cut
close
.
 
<EOS>
The
duce
take
it
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
make
nothing
of
it
either
way
,
cried
Dr.
Slop
.
 
<EOS>
The
trampling
over
head
near
my
mother
's
bed
-
side
increased
.
 
<EOS>
Pox
take
the
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
get
the
knots
untied
as
long
as
I
live
.
 
<EOS>
My
mother
gave
a
groan
.
 
<EOS>
Lend
me
your
penknife
 
<EOS>
I
must
e'en
cut
the
knots
at
last
 
pugh
!
 
<EOS>
psha
!
 
<EOS>
Lord
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
cut
my
thumb
quite
across
to
the
very
bone
 
<EOS>
curse
the
fellow
 
if
there
was
not
another
man
-
midwife
within
fifty
miles
 
I
am
undone
for
this
bout
 
<EOS>
I
wish
the
scoundrel
<EOS>
hang'd
 
<EOS>
I
wish
he
was
shot
 
<EOS>
I
wish
all
the
devils
in
hell
had
him
for
a
blockhead
!
    
<EOS>
My
father
had
a
great
respect
for
Obadiah
,
and
could
not
bear
to
hear
him
disposed
of
in
such
a
manner
 
<EOS>
he
had
moreover
some
little
respect
for
himself
 
and
could
as
ill
bear
with
the
indignity
offered
to
himself
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
Had
Dr.
Slop
cut
any
part
about
him
,
but
his
thumb
 
<EOS>
my
father
had
pass'd
<EOS>
it
by
 
his
prudence
had
triumphed
:
 
as
it
was
,
he
was
determined
to
have
his
revenge
.
  
<EOS>
Small
curses
<EOS>
,
Dr.
Slop
,
upon
great
occasions
,
quoth
my
father
(
condoling
with
him
first
upon
the
accident
)
are
but
so
much
waste
of
our
strength
and
soul
's
health
to
no
manner
of
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
I
own
it
,
replied
Dr.
Slop
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
like
sparrow
-
shot
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
(
suspending
his
whistling
)
fired
against
a
bastion
.
 
<EOS>
They
serve
,
continued
my
father
,
to
stir
the
humours
  
but
carry
off
none
of
their
acrimony
:
 
for
my
own
part
,
I
seldom
swear
or
curse
at
all
 
<EOS>
I
hold
it
bad
 
<EOS>
but
if
I
fall
into
it
by
surprize
,
I
generally
retain
so
much
presence
of
mind
(
<EOS>
right
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
)
<EOS>
as
to
make
it
answer
my
purpose
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
I
swear
on
till
I
find
myself
easy
.
 
<EOS>
A
wife
and
a
just
man
however
would
always
endeavour
to
proportion
the
vent
given
to
these
humours
,
not
only
to
the
degree
of
them
stirring
within
himself
 
but
to
the
size
and
ill
intent
of
the
offence
upon
which
they
are
to
fall
.
  
<EOS>
"
Injuries
come
only
from
the
heart
,
"
 
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
For
this
reason
,
continued
my
father
,
with
the
most
Cervantick
gravity
,
I
have
the
greatest
veneration
in
the
world
for
that
gentleman
,
who
,
in
distrust
of
his
own
discretion
in
this
point
,
sat
down
and
composed
(
that
is
at
his
leisure
)
fit
forms
of
swearing
suitable
to
all
cases
,
from
the
lowest
to
the
highest
provocation
which
could
possibly
happen
to
him
 
which
forms
being
well
considered
by
him
,
and
such
moreover
as
he
could
stand
to
,
he
kept
them
ever
by
him
on
the
chimney
-
piece
,
within
his
reach
,
ready
for
use
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
apprehended
,
replied
Dr.
Slop
,
that
such
a
thing
was
ever
thought
of
 
much
less
executed
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
,
answered
my
father
;
I
was
reading
,
though
not
using
,
one
of
them
to
my
brother
Toby
this
morning
,
whilst
he
pour'd
<EOS>
out
the
tea
 
<EOS>
'
tis
here
upon
the
shelf
over
my
head
;
 
<EOS>
but
if
I
remember
right
,
'
tis
too
violent
for
a
cut
of
the
thumb
.
 
<EOS>
Not
at
all
,
quoth
Dr.
Slop
 
<EOS>
the
devil
take
the
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
answered
my
father
,
'
Tis
much
at
your
service
,
Dr.
Slop
 
on
condition
you
will
read
it
aloud
;
 
so
rising
up
and
reaching
down
a
form
of
excommunication
of
the
church
of
Rome
,
<EOS>
a
copy
of
which
,
my
father
(
who
was
curious
in
his
collections
)
had
procured
out
of
the
leger
-
book
of
the
church
of
Rochester
,
writ
by
Ernulphus
the
bishop
 
with
a
most
affected
seriousness
of
look
and
voice
,
which
might
have
cajoled
Ernulphus
himself
 
<EOS>
he
put
it
into
Dr.
Slop
's
hands
.
 
<EOS>
Dr.
Slop
wrapt
his
thumb
up
in
the
corner
of
his
handkerchief
,
and
with
a
wry
face
,
though
without
any
suspicion
,
read
aloud
,
as
follows
 
my
uncle
Toby
whistling
Lillabullero
as
loud
as
he
could
all
the
time

(
As
the

I
think
there
is
no
necessity
,
quoth
Dr.
Slop
,
dropping
the
paper
down
to
his
knee
,
and
addressing
himself
to
my
father
 
as
you
have
read
it
over
,
Sir
,
so
lately
,
to
read
it
aloud
 
and
as
Captain
Shandy
seems
to
have
no
great
inclination
to
hear
it
 
<EOS>
I
may
as
well
read
it
to
myself
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
contrary
to
treaty
,
replied
my
father
:
 
besides
,
there
is
something
so
whimsical
,
especially
in
the
latter
part
of
it
,
I
should
grieve
to
lose
the
pleasure
of
a
second
reading
.
 
<EOS>
Dr.
Slop
did
not
altogether
like
it
,
  
<EOS>
but
my
uncle
Toby
offering
at
that
instant
to
give
over
whistling
,
and
read
it
himself
to
them
<EOS>
;
 
Dr.
Slop
thought
he
might
as
well
read
it
under
the
cover
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
whistling
 
as
suffer
my
uncle
Toby
to
read
it
alone
;
 
so
raising
up
the
paper
to
his
face
,
and
holding
it
quite
parallel
to
it
,
in
order
to
hide
his
chagrin
 
<EOS>
he
read
it
aloud
as
follows
 
my
uncle
Toby
whistling
Lillabullero
,
though
not
quite
so
loud
as
before
.

up
his
mouth
,
and
was
just
beginning
to
return
my
uncle
Toby
the
compliment
of
his
Whu
 
<EOS>
u
 
u
 
or
interjectional
whistle
 
when
the
door
hastily
opening
in
the
next
chapter
but
<EOS>
one
 
put
an
end
to
the
affair
.
    
<EOS>
Now
do
n't
let
us
give
ourselves
a
parcel
of
airs
,
and
pretend
that
the
oaths
we
make
free
with
in
this
land
of
liberty
of
ours
are
our
own
;
and
because
we
have
the
spirit
to
swear
them
,
 
<EOS>
imagine
that
we
have
had
the
wit
to
invent
them
too
.
  
<EOS>
I
'll
undertake
this
moment
to
prove
it
to
any
man
in
the
world
,
except
to
a
connoisseur
:
 
though
I
declare
I
object
only
to
a
connoisseur
in
swearing
,
 
as
I
would
do
to
a
connoisseur
in
painting
,
&
c.
&
c.
<EOS>
the
whole
set
of
'em
are
so
hung
round
and
<EOS>
befetish'd
with
the
bobs
and
trinkets
of
criticism
,
  
or
to
drop
my
metaphor
,
which
by
the
bye
is
a
pity
 
<EOS>
for
I
have
<EOS>
fetch'd
<EOS>
it
as
far
as
from
the
coast
of
Guiney
;
 
their
heads
,
Sir
,
are
stuck
so
full
of
rules
and
compasses
,
and
have
that
eternal
propensity
to
apply
them
upon
all
occasions
,
that
a
work
of
genius
had
better
go
to
the
devil
at
once
,
than
stand
to
be
prick'd
and
tortured
to
death
by
'em
.
    
<EOS>
And
how
did
Garrick
speak
the
soliloquy
last
night
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
against
all
rule
,
my
lord
,
 
most
ungrammatically
!
<EOS>
betwixt
the
substantive
and
the
adjective
,
which
should
agree
together
in
number
,
case
,
and
gender
<EOS>
,
he
made
a
breach
thus
,
 
stopping
,
as
if
the
point
wanted
settling
;
 
and
betwixt
the
nominative
case
,
which
your
lordship
knows
should
govern
the
verb
,
he
suspended
his
voice
in
the
epilogue
a
dozen
times
three
seconds
and
three
fifths
by
a
stop
watch
,
my
lord
,
each
time
.
 
<EOS>
Admirable
grammarian
!
 
<EOS>
But
in
suspending
his
voice
 
was
the
sense
suspended
likewise
?
 
<EOS>
Did
no
expression
of
attitude
or
countenance
fill
up
the
chasm
?
 
<EOS>
Was
the
eye
silent
?
 
<EOS>
Did
you
narrowly
look
?
 
<EOS>
I
look'd
<EOS>
only
at
the
stop
-
watch
,
my
lord
.
 
<EOS>
Excellent
observer
!
  
<EOS>
And
what
of
this
new
book
the
whole
world
makes
such
a
rout
about
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
'
<EOS>
tis
out
of
all
plumb
,
my
lord
,
 
quite
an
irregular
thing
!
 
<EOS>
not
one
of
the
angles
at
the
four
corners
was
a
right
angle
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
my
rule
and
compasses
,
&
c.
<EOS>
my
lord
,
in
my
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
Excellent
critick
!
    
<EOS>
And
for
the
epick
poem
your
lordship
bid
me
look
at
 
upon
taking
the
length
,
breadth
,
height
,
and
depth
of
it
,
and
trying
them
at
home
upon
an
exact
scale
of
Bossu
's
 
'
tis
out
,
my
lord
,
in
every
one
of
its
dimensions
.
 
<EOS>
Admirable
connoisseur
!
    
<EOS>
And
did
you
step
in
,
to
take
a
look
at
the
grand
picture
in
your
way
back
?
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
a
melancholy
daub
!
<EOS>
my
lord
;
not
one
principle
of
the
pyramid
in
any
one
group
!
 
<EOS>
and
what
a
price
!
 
<EOS>
for
there
is
nothing
of
the
colouring
of
Titian
 
the
expression
of
Rubens
 
the
grace
of
Raphael
 
<EOS>
the
purity
of
Dominichino
 
the
corregiescity
of
Corregio
 
the
learning
of
Poussin
 
<EOS>
the
airs
of
Guido
 
<EOS>
the
taste
of
the
Carrachis
 
or
the
grand
contour
of
Angelo
.
 
<EOS>
Grant
me
patience
,
just
Heaven
!
 
<EOS>
Of
all
the
cants
which
are
canted
in
this
canting
world
 
though
the
ca
nt
of
hypocrites
may
be
the
worst
 
<EOS>
the
ca
nt
of
criticism
is
the
most
tormenting
!
  
<EOS>
I
would
go
fifty
miles
on
foot
,
for
I
have
not
a
horse
worth
riding
on
,
to
kiss
the
hand
of
that
man
whose
generous
heart
will
give
up
the
reins
of
his
imagination
into
his
author
's
hands
 
<EOS>
be
pleased
he
knows
not
why
,
and
cares
not
wherefore
.
  
<EOS>
Great
Apollo
!
<EOS>
if
thou
art
in
a
giving
humour
 
give
me
 
<EOS>
I
ask
no
more
,
but
one
stroke
of
native
humour
,
with
a
single
spark
of
thy
own
fire
along
with
it
 
and
send
Mercury
,
with
the
rules
and
compasses
,
if
he
can
be
spared
,
with
my
compliments
to
 
no
matter
.
  
<EOS>
Now
to
any
one
else
I
will
undertake
to
prove
,
that
all
the
oaths
and
imprecations
which
we
have
been
puffing
off
upon
the
world
for
these
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
last
past
as
originals
 
except
St.
Paul
's
thumb
  
<EOS>
God
's
flesh
and
God
's
fish
,
which
were
oaths
monarchical
,
and
,
considering
who
made
them
,
not
much
amiss
;
and
as
kings
oaths
,
'
tis
not
much
matter
whether
they
were
fish
or
flesh
;
 
else
<EOS>
I
say
,
there
is
not
an
oath
,
or
at
least
a
curse
amongst
them
,
which
has
not
been
copied
over
and
over
again
out
of
Ernulphus
a
thousand
times
:
 
<EOS>
but
,
like
all
other
copies
,
how
infinitely
short
of
the
force
and
spirit
of
the
original
!
 
<EOS>
it
is
thought
to
be
no
bad
oath
 
and
by
itself
passes
very
well
 
<EOS>
"
G
-
d
damn
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
Set
it
beside
Ernulphus
's
 
"
God
almighty
the
Father
<EOS>
damn
you
 
God
the
Son
damn
you
 
God
the
Holy
Ghost
<EOS>
damn
you
<EOS>
"
 
you
see
'
tis
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
an
orientality
in
his
,
we
can
not
rise
up
to
:
 
<EOS>
besides
,
he
is
more
copious
in
his
invention
 
possess'd
<EOS>
more
of
the
excellencies
of
a
swearer
 
had
such
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
human
frame
,
its
membranes
,
nerves
,
ligaments
,
knittings
of
the
joints
,
and
articulations
,
 
<EOS>
that
when
Ernulphus
cursed
 
no
part
escaped
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tis
true
there
is
something
of
a
hardness
in
his
manner
 
and
,
as
in
Michael
Angelo
,
a
want
of
grace
 
<EOS>
but
then
there
is
such
a
greatness
of
gusto
!
  
<EOS>
My
father
,
who
generally
look'd
upon
every
thing
in
a
light
very
different
from
all
mankind
,
would
,
after
all
,
never
allow
this
to
be
an
original
.
 
<EOS>
He
considered
rather
<EOS>
Ernulphus
's
anathema
,
as
an
institute
of
swearing
,
in
which
,
as
he
suspected
,
upon
the
decline
of
swearing
in
some
milder
pontificate
,
Ernulphus
,
by
order
of
the
succeeding
pope
,
had
with
great
learning
and
diligence
collected
together
all
the
laws
of
it
;
 
for
the
same
reason
that
Justinian
,
in
the
decline
of
the
empire
,
had
ordered
his
chancellor
Tribonian
to
collect
the
Roman
or
civil
laws
all
together
into
one
code
or
digest
 
lest
,
through
the
rust
of
time
 
and
the
fatality
of
all
things
committed
to
oral
tradition
 
<EOS>
they
should
be
lost
to
the
world
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
For
this
reason
my
father
would
oft
-
times
affirm
,
there
was
not
an
oath
from
the
great
and
tremendous
oath
of
William
the
conqueror
(
By
the
splendour
of
God
)
down
to
the
lowest
oath
of
a
scavenger
<EOS>
(
Damn
your
eyes
)
which
was
not
to
be
found
in
Ernulphus
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
he
would
add
 
I
defy
a
man
to
swear
out
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
hypothesis
is
,
like
most
of
my
father
's
,
singular
and
ingenious
too
;
  
nor
have
I
any
objection
to
it
,
but
that
it
overturns
my
own
.
      
<EOS>
Bless
my
soul
!
 
<EOS>
my
poor
mistress
is
ready
to
faint
 
and
her
pains
are
gone
 
and
the
drops
are
done
 
and
the
bottle
of
julap
is
broke
 
and
the
nurse
has
cut
her
arm
 
<EOS>
(
and
I
,
my
thumb
,
cried
Dr.
Slop
,
)
and
the
child
is
where
it
was
,
continued
Susannah
,
 
and
the
midwife
has
fallen
backwards
upon
the
edge
of
the
fender
,
and
bruised
her
hip
as
black
as
your
hat
.
  
<EOS>
I
'll
look
at
it
,
quoth
<EOS>
Dr
Slop
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
need
of
that
,
replied
Susannah
,
 
<EOS>
you
had
better
look
at
my
mistress
 
but
the
midwife
would
gladly
first
give
you
an
account
how
things
are
,
so
desires
you
would
go
up
stairs
and
speak
to
her
this
moment
.
  
<EOS>
Human
nature
is
the
same
in
all
professions
.
  
<EOS>
The
midwife
had
just
before
been
put
over
Dr.
Slop
's
head
 
<EOS>
He
had
not
digested
it
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
replied
Dr.
Slop
,
"
twould
be
full
as
proper
if
the
midwife
came
down
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
like
subordination
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
 
<EOS>
and
but
for
it
,
after
the
reduction
of
Lisle
,
I
know
not
what
might
have
become
of
the
garrison
of
Ghent
,
in
the
mutiny
for
bread
,
in
the
year
<EOS>
Ten
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
,
replied
Dr.
Slop
,
(
parodying
my
uncle
Toby
's
hobby
-
horsical
reflection
;
though
full
as
hobby
-
horsical
himself
)
 
<EOS>
do
I
know
,
Captain
Shandy
,
what
might
have
become
of
the
garrison
above
stairs
,
in
the
mutiny
and
confusion
<EOS>
I
find
all
things
are
in
at
present
,
but
for
the
subordination
of
fingers
and
thumbs
to
.
.
.
 
<EOS>
the
application
of
which
,
Sir
,
under
this
accident
of
mine
,
comes
in
so
a
propos
,
<EOS>
that
without
it
,
the
cut
upon
my
thumb
might
have
been
felt
by
the
Shandy
family
,
as
long
as
the
Shandy
family
had
a
name
.
    
<EOS>
Let
us
go
back
to
the
.
.
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
last
chapter
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
a
singular
stroke
of
eloquence
(
at
least
it
was
so
,
when
eloquence
flourished
at
Athens
and
Rome
,
and
would
be
so
now
,
did
orators
wear
mantles
)
not
to
mention
the
name
of
a
thing
,
when
you
had
the
thing
about
you
in
petto
,
ready
to
produce
,
pop
,
<EOS>
in
the
place
you
want
it
.
 
<EOS>
A
scar
,
an
axe
,
a
sword
,
a
pink'd
doublet
,
a
rusty
helmet
,
a
pound
and
a
half
of
pot-
ashes
in
an
urn
,
or
a
three
-
halfpenny
pickle
pot
 
but
above
all
,
a
tender
infant
royally
accoutred
.
 
<EOS>
Tho
'
if
it
was
too
young
,
and
the
oration
as
long
as
Tully
's
second
Philippick
 
it
must
certainly
have
beshit
the
orator
's
mantle
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
again
,
if
too
old
,
 
it
must
have
been
unwieldly
and
incommodious
to
his
action
 
so
as
to
make
him
lose
by
his
child
almost
as
much
as
he
could
gain
by
it
.
 
<EOS>
Otherwise
,
when
a
state
orator
has
hit
the
precise
age
to
a
minute
 
hid
his
Bambino
in
his
mantle
so
cunningly
that
no
mortal
could
smell
it
 
and
produced
it
so
critically
,
that
no
soul
could
say
,
it
came
in
by
head
and
shoulders
 
<EOS>
Oh
Sirs
!
<EOS>
it
has
done
wonders
 
<EOS>
It
has
open'd
<EOS>
the
sluices
,
and
turn'd
<EOS>
the
brains
,
and
shook
the
principles
,
and
unhinged
the
politicks
of
half
a
nation
.
  
<EOS>
These
feats
however
are
not
to
be
done
,
except
in
those
states
and
times
,
I
say
,
where
orators
wore
mantles
 
and
pretty
large
ones
too
,
my
brethren
,
with
some
twenty
or
five
-
and
-
twenty
yards
of
good
purple
,
superfine
,
marketable
cloth
in
them
 
with
large
flowing
folds
and
doubles
,
and
in
a
great
style
of
design
.
 
<EOS>
All
which
plainly
shews
,
may
it
please
your
worships
,
that
the
decay
of
eloquence
,
and
the
little
good
service
it
does
at
present
,
both
within
and
without
doors
,
is
owing
to
nothing
else
in
the
world
,
but
short
coats
,
and
the
disuse
of
trunk
-
hose
.
 
<EOS>
We
can
conceal
nothing
under
ours
,
Madam
,
worth
shewing
.
    
<EOS>
Dr.
Slop
was
within
an
ace
of
being
an
exception
to
all
this
argumentation
:
 
for
happening
to
have
his
green
baize
bag
upon
his
knees
,
when
he
began
to
parody
my
uncle
Toby
 
'
twas
as
good
as
the
best
mantle
in
the
world
to
him
:
 
for
which
purpose
,
when
he
foresaw
the
sentence
would
end
in
his
new-
invented
forceps
,
he
thrust
his
hand
into
the
bag
in
order
to
have
them
ready
to
clap
in
,
when
your
reverences
took
so
much
notice
of
the
.
.
.
,
which
had
he
managed
 
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
had
certainly
been
overthrown
:
 
the
sentence
and
the
argument
in
that
case
jumping
closely
in
one
point
,
so
like
the
two
lines
which
form
the
salient
angle
of
a
ravelin
,
 
Dr.
Slop
would
never
have
given
them
up
;
 
and
my
uncle
Toby
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
flying
,
as
taking
them
by
force
:
 
but
Dr.
Slop
fumbled
so
vilely
in
pulling
them
out
<EOS>
,
it
took
off
the
whole
effect
,
and
what
was
a
ten
times
worse
evil
(
for
they
seldom
come
alone
in
this
life
)
in
pulling
out
his
forceps
,
his
forceps
unfortunately
drew
out
the
squirt
along
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
When
a
proposition
can
be
taken
in
two
senses
 
'
tis
a
law
in
disputation
,
That
the
respondent
may
reply
to
which
of
the
two
he
pleases
,
or
finds
most
convenient
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
This
threw
the
advantage
of
the
argument
quite
on
my
uncle
Toby
's
side
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
God
!
"
cried
my
uncle
Toby
,
"
are
children
brought
into
the
world
with
a
squirt
?
"
      
<EOS>
Upon
my
honour
,
Sir
,
you
have
tore
every
bit
of
skin
quite
off
the
back
of
both
my
hands
with
your
forceps
,
cried
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
and
you
have
<EOS>
crush'd
<EOS>
all
my
knuckles
into
the
bargain
with
them
to
a
jelly
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
your
own
fault
,
said
Dr.
Slop
 
you
should
have
clinch'd
<EOS>
your
two
fists
together
into
the
form
of
a
child
's
head
as
I
told
you
,
and
sat
firm
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
so
,
answered
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
points
of
my
forceps
have
not
been
sufficiently
arm'd
,
or
the
rivet
wants
closing
 
or
else
the
cut
on
my
thumb
has
made
me
a
little
aukward
 
or
<EOS>
possibly
 
"
Tis
<EOS>
well
,
quoth
my
father
,
interrupting
the
detail
of
possibilities
 
that
the
experiment
was
not
first
made
upon
my
child
's
head
-
piece
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
not
have
been
a
cherry
-
stone
the
worse
,
answered
Dr.
Slop
.
 
<EOS>
I
maintain
it
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
it
would
have
broke
the
cerebellum
(
unless
indeed
the
skull
had
been
as
hard
as
a
granado
)
and
turn'd
<EOS>
it
all
into
a
perfect
posset
.
 
<EOS>
Pshaw
!
replied
Dr.
Slop
,
a
child
's
head
is
naturally
as
soft
as
the
pap
of
an
apple
;
 
the
sutures
give
way
 
and
besides
,
I
could
have
extracted
by
the
feet
after
.
 
<EOS>
Not
you
,
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
I
rather
wish
you
would
begin
that
way
,
quoth
my
father
.
  
<EOS>
Pray
do
,
added
my
uncle
Toby
.
      
<EOS>
And
pray
,
good
woman
,
after
all
,
will
you
take
upon
you
to
say
,
it
may
not
be
the
child
's
hip
,
as
well
as
the
child
's
head
?
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
most
certainly
the
head
,
replied
the
midwife
.
 
<EOS>
Because
,
continued
Dr.
Slop
<EOS>
(
turning
to
my
father
)
<EOS>
as
positive
as
these
old
ladies
generally
are
 
'
<EOS>
tis
a
point
very
difficult
to
know
 
and
yet
of
the
greatest
consequence
to
be
known
;
  
because
,
Sir
,
if
the
hip
is
mistaken
for
the
head
 
there
is
a
possibility
(
if
it
is
a
boy
)
<EOS>
that
the
forceps
.
.
<EOS>
..
    
<EOS>
What
the
possibility
was
,
Dr.
Slop
whispered
very
low
to
my
father
,
and
then
to
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
such
danger
,
continued
he
,
with
the
head
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
in
truth
quoth
<EOS>
my
father
 
<EOS>
but
when
your
possibility
has
taken
place
at
the
hip
 
<EOS>
you
may
as
well
take
off
the
head
too
.
    
<EOS>
It
is
morally
impossible
the
reader
should
understand
this
 
'
<EOS>
tis
enough
Dr.
Slop
understood
it
;
 
so
taking
the
green
baize
bag
in
his
hand
,
with
the
help
of
Obadiah
's
pumps
,
he
tripp'd
pretty
nimbly
,
for
a
man
of
his
size
,
across
the
room
to
the
door
 
and
from
the
door
was
shewn
the
way
,
by
the
good
old
midwife
,
to
my
mother
's
apartments
.
    
<EOS>
It
is
two
hours
,
and
ten
minutes
 
and
no
more
 
cried
my
father
,
looking
at
his
watch
,
since
Dr.
Slop
and
Obadiah
arrived
 
<EOS>
and
I
know
not
how
it
happens
,
<EOS>
Brother
Toby
 
<EOS>
but
to
my
imagination
it
seems
almost
an
age
.
    
<EOS>
Here
 
pray
,
Sir
,
take
hold
of
my
cap
 
nay
,
take
the
bell
along
with
it
,
and
my
pantoufles
too
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
Sir
,
they
are
all
at
your
service
;
and
I
freely
make
you
a
present
of
'em
,
on
condition
you
give
me
all
your
attention
to
this
chapter
.
  
<EOS>
Though
my
father
said
,
"
he
knew
not
how
it
happen'd
,
"
 
yet
he
knew
very
well
how
it
happen'd
;
 
and
at
the
instant
he
spoke
it
,
was
pre
-
determined
in
his
mind
to
give
my
uncle
Toby
a
clear
account
of
the
matter
by
a
metaphysical
dissertation
upon
the
subject
of
duration
and
its
simple
modes
,
in
order
to
shew
my
uncle
Toby
by
what
mechanism
and
mensurations
in
the
brain
<EOS>
it
came
to
pass
,
that
the
rapid
succession
of
their
ideas
,
and
the
eternal
scampering
of
the
discourse
from
one
thing
to
another
,
since
Dr.
Slop
had
come
into
the
room
,
had
lengthened
out
so
short
a
period
to
so
inconceivable
an
extent
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
how
it
happens
 
<EOS>
cried
my
father
,
 
<EOS>
but
it
seems
an
age
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
'
Tis
owing
entirely
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
to
the
succession
of
our
ideas
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
,
who
had
an
itch
,
in
common
with
all
philosophers
,
of
reasoning
upon
every
thing
which
happened
,
and
accounting
for
it
too
 
proposed
infinite
pleasure
to
himself
in
this
,
of
the
succession
of
ideas
,
and
had
not
the
least
apprehension
of
having
it
snatch'd
out
of
his
hands
by
my
uncle
Toby
,
who
(
honest
man
!
)
<EOS>
generally
took
every
thing
as
it
happened
;
  
and
who
,
of
all
things
in
the
world
,
troubled
his
brain
the
least
with
abstruse
thinking
;
 
the
ideas
of
time
and
space
 
or
how
we
came
by
those
ideas
 
or
of
what
stuff
they
were
made
 
or
whether
they
were
born
with
us
  
or
we
picked
them
up
afterwards
as
we
went
along
 
or
whether
we
did
it
in
frocks
 
or
not
till
we
had
got
into
breeches
 
with
a
thousand
other
inquiries
and
disputes
about
Infinity
Prescience
,
Liberty
,
Necessity
,
and
so
forth
,
upon
whose
desperate
and
unconquerable
theories
<EOS>
so
many
fine
heads
have
been
turned
and
cracked
 
never
did
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
's
the
least
injury
at
all
;
my
father
knew
it
 
and
was
no
less
surprized
than
he
was
disappointed
,
with
my
uncle
's
fortuitous
solution
.
  
<EOS>
Do
you
understand
the
theory
of
that
affair
?
<EOS>
replied
my
father
.
  
<EOS>
Not
I
,
quoth
my
uncle
.
    
<EOS>
But
you
have
some
ideas
,
said
my
father
,
of
what
you
talk
about
?
  
<EOS>
No
more
than
my
horse
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
.
  
<EOS>
Gracious
heaven
!
<EOS>
cried
my
father
,
looking
upwards
,
and
clasping
his
two
hands
together
 
there
is
a
worth
in
thy
honest
ignorance
,
<EOS>
brother
Toby
  
'
<EOS>
twere
almost
a
pity
to
exchange
it
for
a
knowledge
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
'll
tell
thee
.
    
<EOS>
To
understand
what
time
is
aright
,
without
which
we
never
can
comprehend
infinity
,
insomuch
as
one
is
a
portion
of
the
other
 
we
ought
seriously
to
sit
down
and
consider
what
idea
it
is
we
have
of
duration
,
so
as
to
give
a
satisfactory
account
how
we
came
by
it
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
that
to
any
body
?
<EOS>
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
(
Vide
Locke
.
)
 
<EOS>
For
if
you
will
turn
your
eyes
inwards
upon
your
mind
,
continued
my
father
,
and
observe
attentively
,
you
will
perceive
,
brother
,
that
whilst
you
and
I
are
talking
together
,
and
thinking
,
and
smoking
our
pipes
,
or
whilst
we
receive
successively
ideas
in
our
minds
,
we
know
that
we
do
exist
,
and
so
we
estimate
the
existence
,
or
the
continuation
of
the
existence
of
ourselves
,
or
any
thing
else
,
commensurate
to
the
succession
of
any
ideas
in
our
minds
,
the
duration
of
ourselves
,
or
any
such
other
thing
co
-
existing
with
our
thinking
 
and
so
according
to
that
preconceived
 
<EOS>
You
puzzle
me
to
death
,
cried
my
uncle
Toby
.
    
<EOS>
'
Tis
owing
to
this
,
replied
my
father
,
that
in
our
computations
of
time
,
we
are
so
used
to
minutes
,
hours
,
weeks
,
and
months
 
and
of
clocks
(
I
wish
there
was
not
a
clock
in
the
kingdom
)
to
measure
out
their
several
portions
to
us
,
and
to
those
who
belong
to
us
 
<EOS>
that
'
twill
be
well
,
if
in
time
to
come
,
the
succession
of
our
ideas
be
of
any
use
or
service
to
us
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
whether
we
observe
it
or
no
,
continued
my
father
,
in
every
sound
man
's
head
,
there
is
a
regular
succession
of
ideas
of
one
sort
or
other
,
which
follow
each
other
in
train
just
like
 
A
train
of
artillery
?
<EOS>
said
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
A
train
of
a
fiddle
-
stick
!
 
<EOS>
quoth
<EOS>
my
father
 
which
follow
and
succeed
one
another
in
our
minds
at
certain
distances
,
just
like
the
images
in
the
inside
of
a
lanthorn
turned
round
by
the
heat
of
a
candle
.
 
<EOS>
I
declare
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
mine
are
more
like
a
smoke
-
jack
,
 
Then
,
brother
Toby
,
I
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
you
upon
that
subject
,
said
my
father
.
      
<EOS>
What
a
conjuncture
was
here
lost
!
 
<EOS>
My
father
in
one
of
his
best
explanatory
moods
 
in
eager
pursuit
of
a
metaphysical
point
into
the
very
regions
,
where
clouds
and
thick
darkness
would
soon
have
encompassed
it
about
;
 
my
uncle
Toby
in
one
of
the
finest
dispositions
for
it
in
the
world
;
 
his
head
like
a
smoke
-
jack
;
 
the
funnel
unswept
,
and
the
ideas
whirling
round
and
round
about
in
it
,
all
obfuscated
and
darkened
over
with
fuliginous
matter
!
 
<EOS>
By
the
tomb
-
stone
of
Lucian
 
if
it
is
in
being
 
if
not
,
why
then
by
his
ashes
!
<EOS>
by
the
ashes
of
my
dear
Rabelais
,
and
dearer
Cervantes
!
 
<EOS>
my
father
and
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
's
discourse
upon
Time
and
Eternity
 
was
a
discourse
devoutly
to
be
wished
for
!
<EOS>
and
the
petulancy
of
my
father
's
humour
,
in
putting
a
stop
to
it
as
he
did
,
was
a
robbery
of
the
Ontologic
Treasury
of
such
a
jewel
,
as
no
coalition
of
great
occasions
and
great
men
are
ever
likely
to
restore
to
it
again
.
    
<EOS>
Tho
'
my
father
persisted
in
not
going
on
with
the
discourse
 
<EOS>
yet
he
could
not
get
my
uncle
Toby
's
smoke
-
jack
out
of
his
head
 
piqued
as
he
was
at
first
with
it
;
 
there
was
something
in
the
comparison
at
the
bottom
,
which
hit
his
fancy
;
for
which
purpose
,
resting
his
elbow
upon
the
table
,
and
reclining
the
right
side
of
his
head
upon
the
palm
of
his
hand
 
but
looking
first
stedfastly
in
the
fire
 
he
began
to
commune
with
himself
,
and
philosophize
about
it
:
 
but
his
spirits
being
wore
out
with
the
fatigues
of
investigating
new
tracts
,
and
the
constant
exertion
of
his
faculties
upon
that
variety
of
subjects
which
had
taken
their
turn
in
the
discourse
 
the
idea
of
the
smoke
jack
soon
turned
all
his
ideas
upside
down
 
so
that
he
fell
asleep
almost
before
he
knew
what
he
was
about
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
my
uncle
Toby
,
his
smoke
-
jack
had
not
made
a
dozen
revolutions
,
before
he
fell
asleep
also
.
 
<EOS>
Peace
be
with
them
both

<EOS>
and

use

and

my

<EOS>
The
Author
's
Preface
  
<EOS>
No
,
I
'll
not
say
a
word
about
it
 
here
it
is
;
 
in
publishing
it
 
I
have
appealed
to
the
world
 
and
to
the
world
<EOS>
I
leave
it
;
 
it
must
speak
for
itself
.
  
<EOS>
All
I
know
of
the
matter
is
 
when
I
sat
down
,
my
intent
was
to
write
a
good
book
;
and
as
far
as
the
tenuity
of
my
understanding
would
hold
out
 
a
wise
,
aye
,
and
a
discreet
 
taking
care
only
,
as
I
went
along
,
to
put
into
it
all
the
wit
and
the
judgment
<EOS>
(
be
it
more
or
less
)
which
the
great
Author
and
Bestower
of
them
had
thought
fit
originally
to
give
me
 
so
that
,
as
your
worships
see
 
'
tis
just
as
God
pleases
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
Agalastes
(
speaking
dispraisingly
)
sayeth
,
That
there
may
be
some
wit
in
it
,
for
aught
he
knows
 
but
no
judgment
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
And
Triptolemus
and
Phutatorius
agreeing
thereto
,
ask
,
How
is
it
possible
there
should
?
<EOS>
for
that
wit
and
judgment
in
this
world
never
go
together
;
inasmuch
as
they
are
two
operations
differing
from
each
other
as
wide
as
east
from
west
 
<EOS>
So
,
says
Locke
 
so
are
farting
and
hickuping
,
say
I.
 
<EOS>
But
in
answer
to
this
,
Didius
the
great
church
lawyer
,
in
his
code
de
fartendi
et
illustrandi
fallaciis
,
doth
maintain
and
make
fully
appear
,
That
an
illustration
is
no
argument
 
nor
do
I
maintain
the
wiping
of
a
looking
-
glass
clean
to
be
a
syllogism
;
 
but
you
all
,
may
it
please
your
worships
,
see
the
better
for
it
 
so
that
the
main
good
these
things
do
is
only
to
clarify
the
understanding
,
previous
to
the
application
of
the
argument
itself
,
in
order
to
free
it
from
any
little
motes
,
or
specks
of
opacular
matter
,
which
,
if
left
swimming
therein
,
might
hinder
a
conception
and
spoil
all

,
in
case
the
thing
is
not
done
already
for
us
 
is
,
that
the
great
gifts
and
endowments
both
of
wit
and
judgment
,
with
every
thing
which
usually
goes
along
with
them
 
such
as
memory
,
fancy
,
genius
,
eloquence
,
quick
parts
,
and
what
not
,
may
this
precious
moment
,
without
stint
or
measure
,
let
or
hindrance
,
be
poured
down
warm
as
each
of
us
could
bear
it
 
scum
and
sediment
and
all
(
for
I
would
not
have
a
drop
lost
)
into
the
several
receptacles
,
cells
,
cellules
,
domiciles
,
dormitories
,
refectories
,
and
spare
places
of
our
brains
 
in
such
sort
,
that
they
might
continue
to
be
injected
and
tunn'd
into
,
according
to
the
true
intent
and
meaning
of
my
wish
,
until
every
vessel
of
them
,
both
great
and
small
,
be
so
replenish'd
,
saturated
,
and
filled
up
therewith
,
that
no
more

would
it
save
a

could
possibly
be
got
either
in

out

<EOS>
Bless
us
!
 
<EOS>
what
noble
work
we
should
make
!
 
<EOS>
how
should
I
tickle
it
off
!
  
<EOS>
and
what
spirits
should
I
find
myself
in
,
to
be
writing
away
for
such
readers

<EOS>
and
you
 
just
heaven

<EOS>
with
what
raptures
would
you
sit
and
read
 
<EOS>
but
<EOS>
oh
!
 
<EOS>
'
tis
too
much
 
<EOS>
I
am
sick
 
<EOS>
I
faint
away
deliciously
at
the
thoughts
of
it
 
'
<EOS>
tis
more
than
nature
can
bear
!
 
<EOS>
lay
hold
of
me
 
<EOS>
I
am
giddy
 
<EOS>
I
am
stone
blind
 
<EOS>
I
'm
dying
 
<EOS>
I
am
gone

<EOS>
Help
!
 
<EOS>
Help
!
 
<EOS>
Help
!
 
<EOS>
But
hold
 
<EOS>
I
grow
something
better
again
,
for
I
am
beginning
to
foresee
,
when
this
is
over
,
that
as
we
shall
all
of
us
continue
to
be
great
wits
 
<EOS>
we
should
never
agree
amongst
ourselves
,
one
day
to
an
end
:
 
there
would
be
so
much
satire
and
sarcasm
 
scoffing
and
flouting
,
with
raillying
and
reparteeing
of
it
 
thrusting
and
parrying
in
one
corner
or
another
 
there
would
be
nothing
but
mischief
among
us
 
Chaste
stars
!
<EOS>
what
biting
and
scratching
,
and
what
a
racket
and
a
clatter
we
should
make
,
<EOS>
what
with
breaking
of
heads
,
rapping
of
knuckles
,
and
hitting
of
sore
places
 
there
would
be
no
such
thing
as
living
for
us
.
  
<EOS>
But
then
again
,
as
we
should
all
of
us
be
men
of
great
judgment
,
we
should
make
up
matters
as
fast
as
ever
they
went
wrong
;
and
though
we
should
abominate
each
other
ten
times
worse
than
so
many
devils
or
devilesses
,
we
should
nevertheless
,
my
dear
creatures
,
be
all
courtesy
and
kindness
,
milk
and
honey
 
<EOS>
'
twould
be
a
second
land
of
promise
 
a
paradise
upon
earth
,
if
there
was
such
a
thing
to
be
had
 
so
that
upon
the
whole
we
should
have
done
well
enough
.
  
<EOS>
All
I
fret
and
fume
at
,
and
what
most
distresses
my
invention
at
present
,
is
how
to
bring
the
point
itself
to
bear
;
for
as
your
worships
well
know
,
that
of
these
heavenly
emanations
of
wit
and
judgment
,
which
I
have
so
bountifully
wished
both
for
your
worships
and
myself
 
there
is
but
a
certain
quantum
stored
up
for
us
all
,
for
the
use
and
behoof
of
the
whole
race
of
mankind
;
and
such
small
modicums
of
'em
are
only
sent
forth
into
this
wide
world
,
circulating
here
and
there
in
one
bye
corner
or
another
  
and
<EOS>
in
such
narrow
streams
,
and
at
such
prodigious
intervals
from
each
other
,
that
one
would
wonder
how
it
holds
out
,
or
could
be
sufficient
for
the
wants
and
emergencies
of
so
many
great
estates
,
and
populous
empires
.
  
<EOS>
Indeed
there
is
one
thing
to
be
considered
,
that
in
Nova
Zembla
,
North
Lapland
,
and
in
all
those
cold
and
dreary
tracks
of
the
globe
,
which
lie
more
directly
under
the
arctick
and
antartick
circles
,
where
the
whole
province
of
a
man
's
concernments
lies
for
near
nine
months
together
within
the
narrow
compass
of
his
cave
 
<EOS>
where
the
spirits
are
compressed
almost
to
nothing
 
and
where
the
passions
of
a
man
,
with
every
thing
which
belongs
to
them
,
are
as
frigid
as
the
zone
itself
 
there
the
least
quantity
of
judgment
imaginable
does
the
business
 
and
of
wit
 
there
is
a
total
and
an
absolute
saving
 
for
as
not
one
spark
<EOS>
is
wanted
 
<EOS>
so
not
one
spark
is
given
.
 
<EOS>
Angels
and
ministers
of
grace
defend
us
!
<EOS>
what
a
dismal
thing
would
it
have
been
to
have
governed
a
kingdom
,
to
have
fought
a
battle
,
or
made
a
treaty
,
or
run
a
match
,
or
wrote
a
book
,
or
got
a
child
,
or
held
a
provincial
chapter
there
,
with
so
plentiful
a
lack
of
wit
and
judgment
about
us
!
 
<EOS>
For
mercy
's
sake
,
let
us
think
no
more
about
it
,
but
travel
on
as
fast
as
we
can
southwards
into
Norway
 
crossing
over
Swedeland
,
if
you
please
,
through
the
small
triangular
province
of
Angermania
to
the
lake
of
Bothmia
;
coasting
along
it
through
east
and
west
Bothnia
,
down
to
Carelia
,
and
so
on
,
through
all
those
states
and
provinces
which
border
upon
the
far
side
of
the
Gulf
of
Finland
,
and
the
north
-
east
of
the
Baltick
,
up
to
Petersbourg
,
and
just
stepping
into
Ingria
;
 
then
stretching
over
directly
from
thence
through
the
north
parts
of
the
Russian
empire
 
leaving
Siberia
a
little
upon
the
left
hand
,
till
we
got
into
the
very
heart
of
Russian
and
Asiatick
Tartary
.
  
<EOS>
Now
through
this
long
tour
which
I
have
led
you
,
you
observe
the
good
people
are
better
off
by
far
,
than
in
the
polar
countries
which
we
have
just
left
:
 
for
if
you
hold
your
hand
over
your
eyes
,
and
look
very
attentively
,
you
may
perceive
some
small
glimmerings
(
as
it
were
)
of
wit
,
with
a
comfortable
provision
of
good
plain
houshold
judgment
,
which
,
taking
the
quality
and
quantity
of
it
together
,
they
make
a
very
good
shift
with
  
and
had
they
more
of
either
the
one
or
the
other
,
it
would
destroy
the
proper
balance
betwixt
them
,
and
I
am
satisfied
moreover
they
would
want
occasions
to
put
them
to
use
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
Sir
,
if
I
conduct
you
home
again
into
this
warmer
and
more
luxuriant
island
,
where
you
perceive
the
spring
-
tide
of
our
blood
and
humours
runs
high
 
where
we
have
more
ambition
,
and
pride
,
and
envy
,
and
lechery
,
and
other
whoreson
passions
upon
our
hands
to
govern
and
subject
to
reason
 
the
height
of
our
wit
,
and
the
depth
of
our
judgment
,
you
see
,
are
exactly
proportioned
to
the
length
and
breadth
of
our
necessities
 
and
accordingly
we
have
them
sent
down
amongst
us
in
such
a
flowing
kind
of
decent
and
creditable
plenty
,
that
no
one
thinks
he
has
any
cause
to
complain
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
however
be
confessed
on
this
head
,
that
,
as
our
air
blows
hot
and
cold
 
wet
and
dry
,
ten
times
in
a
day
,
we
have
them
in
no
regular
and
settled
way
;
 
so
that
sometimes
for
near
half
a
century
together
,
there
shall
be
very
little
wit
or
judgment
either
to
be
seen
or
heard
of
amongst
us
:
 
<EOS>
the
small
channels
of
them
shall
seem
quite
dried
up
 
then
all
of
a
sudden
the
sluices
shall
break
out
,
and
take
a
fit
of
running
again
like
fury
 
<EOS>
you
would
think
they
would
never
stop
:
 
<EOS>
and
then
it
is
,
that
in
writing
,
and
fighting
,
and
twenty
other
gallant
things
,
we
drive
all
the
world
before
us
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
by
these
observations
,
and
a
wary
reasoning
by
analogy
in
that
kind
of
argumentative
process
,
which
Suidas
calls
dialectick
induction
 
that
I
draw
and
set
up
this
position
as
most
true
and
veritable
;
  
That
of
these
two
luminaries
so
much
of
their
irradiations
are
suffered
from
time
to
time
to
shine
down
upon
us
,
as
he
,
whose
infinite
wisdom
which
dispenses
every
thing
in
exact
weight
and
measure
,
knows
will
just
serve
to
light
us
on
our
way
in
this
night
of
our
obscurity
;
so
that
your
reverences
and
worships
now
find
out
,
nor
is
it
a
moment
longer
in
my
power
to
conceal
it
from
you
,
That
the
fervent
wish
in
your
behalf
with
which
I
set
out
,
was
no
more
than
the
first
insinuating
How
d'ye
of
a
caressing
prefacer
,
stifling
his
reader
,
as
a
lover
sometimes
does
a
coy
mistress
,
into
silence
.
 
<EOS>
For
alas
!
<EOS>
could
this
effusion
of
light
have
been
as
easily
procured
,
as
the
exordium
wished
it
 
<EOS>
I
tremble
to
think
how
many
thousands
for
it
,
of
benighted
travellers
(
in
the
learned
sciences
at
least
)
must
have
groped
and
blundered
on
in
the
dark
,
<EOS>
all
the
nights
of
their
lives
  
running
their
heads
against
posts
,
and
knocking
out
their
brains
without
ever
getting
to
their
journies
end
;
 
some
falling
with
their
noses
perpendicularly
into
sinks
 
others
horizontally
with
their
tails
into
kennels
.
 
<EOS>
Here
one
half
of
a
learned
profession
tilting
full
but
against
the
other
half
of
it
,
and
then
tumbling
and
rolling
one
over
the
other
in
the
dirt
like
hogs
.
 
<EOS>
Here
the
brethren
of
another
profession
,
who
should
have
run
in
opposition
to
each
other
,
flying
on
the
contrary
like
a
flock
of
wild
geese
,
all
in
a
row
the
same
way
.
 
<EOS>
What
confusion
!
 
<EOS>
what
mistakes
!
 
<EOS>
fiddlers
and
painters
judging
by
their
eyes
and
ears
 
admirable
!
 
<EOS>
trusting
to
the
passions
excited
 
in
an
air
sung
,
or
a
story
painted
to
the
heart
  
instead
of
measuring
them
by
a
quadrant
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
fore
-
ground
of
this
picture
,
a
statesman
turning
the
political
wheel
,
like
a
brute
,
the
wrong
way
round
 
against
the
stream
of
corruption
 
by
Heaven
!
 
<EOS>
instead
of
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
corner
,
a
son
of
the
divine
Esculapius
,
writing
a
book
against
predestination
;
perhaps
worse
 
feeling
his
patient
's
pulse
,
instead
of
his
apothecary
's
 
a
brother
of
the
Faculty
in
the
back
-
ground
upon
his
knees
in
tears
 
drawing
the
curtains
of
a
mangled
victim
to
beg
his
forgiveness
;
  
offering
a
fee
 
instead
of
taking
one
.
  
<EOS>
In
that
spacious
Hall
,
a
coalition
of
the
gown
,
from
all
the
bars
of
it
,
driving
a
damn'd
,
dirty
,
vexatious
cause
before
them
,
with
all
their
might
and
main
,
the
wrong
way
!
 
<EOS>
kicking
it
out
of
the
great
doors
,
instead
of
,
in
 
and
with
such
fury
in
their
looks
,
and
such
a
degree
of
inveteracy
in
their
manner
of
kicking
it
,
as
if
the
laws
had
been
originally
made
for
the
peace
and
preservation
of
mankind
:
 
perhaps
a
more
enormous
mistake
committed
by
them
still
 
a
litigated
point
fairly
hung
up
;
 
for
instance
,
Whether
John

his
nose

Tom

his
face

without
a
trespass

not
 
rashly
determined

five

twenty
minutes

which
,
with
the
cautious
pros

cons
required
in
<EOS>
so
intricate
a
proceeding

might
have
taken
up
as
many

surprizes
 
ambuscades
 
<EOS>
mask

and
a
thousand
other
strokes
of
generalship

which
consist
in
catching
at
all
advantages
on
both
sides
  
might
reasonably
have
lasted
them
as
many

finding
food

all
that

No

I
had
 
I
durst
not
for
my

touch
upon
the
subject
 
with
such
weak
nerves

spirits

in
the
condition
I
am
in
at

,
"
twould
be
as
much
as
my
life
was
worth
,
to
deject
and
contrist
myself
with
so
bad
and
melancholy
an
account
 
and
therefore
'
tis
safer
to
draw
a
curtain
across
,
and
hasten
from
it
,
as
fast
as
I
can
,
to
the
main
and
principal
point
I
have
undertaken
to
clear
up
 
and
that
is
,
How
it
comes
to
pass
,
that
your
men
of
least
wit
are
reported
to
be
men
of
most
judgment
.
 
<EOS>
But
mark
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
reported
to
be
 
<EOS>
for
it
is
no
more
<EOS>
,
my
dear
Sirs
,
than
a
report
,
and
which
,
like
twenty
others
taken
up
every
day
upon
trust
,
I
maintain
to
be
a
vile
and
a
malicious
report
into
the
bargain
.
  
<EOS>
This
by
the
help
of
the
observation
already
premised
,
and
I
hope
already
weighed
and
perpended
by
your
reverences
and
worships
<EOS>
,
I
shall
forthwith
make
appear
.
  
<EOS>
I
hate
<EOS>
set
dissertations

above
all
things
in
the
world
,
'
<EOS>
tis
one
of
the
silliest
things
in

to
darken
your

placing
a
number

tall

opake
words
,
one
before
another

in
a
right
line

betwixt
your
own

your

conception

in

likelihood
,
if
you
had
looked
about
,
you
might
have
seen
something
standing

hanging
up

which
would
have
cleared
the
point
at
once

for
what
hindrance

Will
you
give

leave

illustrate
this

by
the
two
knobs

,
you
see
,
with
two
pegs
stuck
slightly
into
two
gimlet
-
holes
,
and
will
place
what
I
have
to
say
in
so
clear
a
light
,
as
to
let
you
see
through
the
drift
and
meaning
of
my
whole
preface
,
as
plainly
as
if
every
point
and
particle
of
it
was
made
up
of
sun
-
beams
.
  
<EOS>
I
enter
now
directly
upon
the
point
.
    
<EOS>
Here
stands
wit
 
<EOS>
and
there
stands
judgment
,
close
beside
it
,
just
like
the
two
knobs
<EOS>
I
'm
speaking
of
,
upon
the
back
of
this
self
-
same
chair
on
which
I
am
sitting
.
    
<EOS>
You
see
,
they
are
the
highest
and
most
ornamental
parts
of
its
frame
 
as
wit
and
judgment
are
of
ours
 
and
like
them
too
,
indubitably
both
made
and
fitted
to
go
together
,
in
order
,
as
we
say
in
all
such
cases
of
duplicated
embellishments
 
to
answer
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
Now
for
the
sake
of
an
experiment
,
and
for
the
clearer
illustrating
this
matter
 
let
us
for
a
moment
take
off
one
of
these
two
curious
ornaments
(
I
care
not
which
)
from
the
point
or
pinnacle
of
the
chair
it
now
stands
on
  
nay
,
do
n't
laugh
at
it
,
 
but
did
you
ever
see
,
in
the
whole
course
of
your
lives
,
such
a
ridiculous
business
as
this
has
made
of
it
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
'
tis
as
miserable
a
sight
as
a
sow
with
one
ear
;
and
there
is
just
as
much
sense
and
symmetry
in
the
one
as
in
the
other
:
 
do
 
pray
,
get
off
your
seats
only
to
take
a
view
of
it
,
 
Now
<EOS>
would
any
man
who
valued
his
character
a
straw
,
have
turned
a
piece
of
work
out
of
his
hand
in
such
a
condition
?
 
<EOS>
nay
,
lay
your
hands
upon
your
hearts
,
and
answer
this
plain
question
,
Whether
this
one
single
knob
,
which
now
stands
here
like
a
blockhead
by
itself
,
can
serve
any
purpose
upon
earth
,
but
to
put
one
in
mind
of
the
want
of
the
other
?
 
and
let
me
farther
ask
,
in
case
the
chair
was
your
own
,
if
you
would
not
in
your
consciences
think
,
rather
than
be
as
it
is
,
that
it
would
be
ten
times
better
without
any
knob
at
all
?
  
<EOS>
Now
these
two
knobs
 
or
top
ornaments
of
the
mind
of
man
,
which
crown
the
whole
entablature
 
<EOS>
being
,
as
I
said
,
wit
and
judgment
,
which
of
all
others
,
as
I
have
proved
it
,
are
the
most
needful
 
the
most
<EOS>
priz'd
 
the
most
calamitous
to
be
without
,
and
consequently
the
hardest
to
come
at
 
for
all
these
reasons
put
together
<EOS>
,
there
is
not
a
mortal
among
us
,
<EOS>
so
destitute
of
a
love
of
good
fame
or
feeding
 
or
so
ignorant
of
what
will
do
him
good
therein
 
who
does
not
wish
and
stedfastly
resolve
in
his
own
mind
,
to
be
,
or
to
be
thought
at
least
,
master
of
the
one
or
the
other
,
and
indeed
of
both
of
them
,
if
the
thing
seems
any
way
feasible
,
or
likely
to
be
brought
to
pass
.
  
<EOS>
Now
your
graver
gentry
having
little
or
no
kind
of
chance
in
aiming
at
the
one
 
unless
they
laid
hold
of
the
other
,
 
pray
what
do
you
think
would
become
of
them
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
Sirs
,
in
spite
of
all
their
gravities
,
they
must
e'en
have
been
contented
to
have
gone
with
their
insides
<EOS>
naked
 
<EOS>
this
was
not
to
be
borne
,
but
by
an
effort
of
philosophy
not
to
be
supposed
in
the
case
we
are
upon
 
so
that
no
one
could
well
have
been
angry
with
them
,
had
they
been
satisfied
with
what
little
they
could
have
snatched
up
and
secreted
under
their
cloaks
and
great
perriwigs
,
<EOS>
had
they
not
raised
a
hue
and
cry
at
the
same
time
against
the
lawful
owners
.
  
<EOS>
I
need
not
tell
your
worships
,
that
this
was
done
with
so
much
cunning
and
artifice
 
that
the
great
Locke
,
who
was
seldom
outwitted
by
false
sounds
  
<EOS>
was
nevertheless
bubbled
here
.
 
<EOS>
The
cry
,
it
seems
,
was
so
deep
and
solemn
a
one
,
and
what
with
the
help
of
great
wigs
<EOS>
,
grave
faces
,
and
other
implements
of
deceit
,
was
rendered
so
general
a
one
against
the
poor
wits
in
this
matter
,
that
the
philosopher
himself
was
deceived
by
it
 
<EOS>
it
was
his
glory
to
free
the
world
from
the
lumber
of
a
thousand
vulgar
errors
;
 
but
this
was
not
of
the
number
;
so
that
instead
of
sitting
down
coolly
,
as
such
a
philosopher
should
have
done
,
to
have
examined
the
matter
of
fact
<EOS>
before
he
philosophised
upon
it
 
on
the
contrary
he
took
the
fact
for
granted
,
and
so
joined
in
with
the
cry
,
and
<EOS>
halloo'd
<EOS>
it
as
boisterously
as
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
This
has
been
made
the
Magna
Charta
of
stupidity
ever
since
 
but
your
reverences
plainly
see
,
it
has
been
obtained
in
such
a
manner
,
that
the
title
to
it
is
not
worth
a
groat
:
 
which
by
-
the
-
bye
is
one
of
the
many
and
vile
impositions
which
gravity
and
grave
folks
have
to
answer
for
hereafter
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
great
wigs
,
upon
which
I
may
be
thought
to
have
spoken
my
mind
too
freely
 
<EOS>
I
beg
leave
to
qualify
whatever
has
been
unguardedly
said
to
their
dispraise
or
prejudice
,
by
one
general
declaration
 
<EOS>
That
I
have
no
abhorrence
whatever
,
nor
do
I
detest
and
abjure
<EOS>
either
great
wigs
or
long
beards
,
any
farther
than
when
I
see
they
are
bespoke
and
let
grow
on
purpose
to
carry
on
this
self
-
same
imposture
 
for
any
purpose
 
peace
be
with
them!--
>
<EOS>
mark
only
 
<EOS>
I
write
not
for
them
.
    
<EOS>
Every
day
for
at
least
ten
years
together
did
my
father
resolve
to
have
it
mended
 
'
tis
not
mended
yet
;
 
no
family
but
ours
would
have
borne
with
it
an
hour
 
and
what
is
most
astonishing
,
there
was
not
a
subject
in
the
world
upon
which
my
father
was
so
eloquent
,
as
upon
that
of
door
-
hinges
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
at
the
same
time
,
he
was
certainly
one
of
the
greatest
bubbles
to
them
,
I
think
,
that
history
can
produce
:
 
<EOS>
his
rhetorick
and
conduct
were
at
perpetual
handy
-
cuffs
.
 
<EOS>
Never
did
the
parlour
-
door
open
 
but
<EOS>
his
philosophy
or
his
principles
fell
a
victim
to
it
;
 
three
drops
of
oil
with
a
feather
,
and
a
smart
stroke
of
a
hammer
,
had
saved
his
honour
for
ever
.
    
<EOS>
Inconsistent
soul
that
man
is
!
 
<EOS>
languishing
under
wounds
,
which
he
has
the
power
to
heal
!
 
<EOS>
his
whole
life
a
contradiction
to
his
knowledge
!
 
<EOS>
his
reason
,
that
precious
gift
of
God
to
him
 
(
instead
of
pouring
in
oil
)
serving
but
to
sharpen
his
sensibilities
 
to
multiply
his
pains
,
and
render
him
more
melancholy
and
uneasy
under
them
!
 
<EOS>
Poor
unhappy
creature
,
that
he
should
do
so
!
 
<EOS>
Are
not
the
necessary
causes
of
misery
in
this
life
enow
,
but
he
must
add
voluntary
ones
to
his
stock
of
sorrow
;
 
struggle
against
evils
which
can
not
be
avoided
,
and
submit
to
others
,
which
a
tenth
part
of
the
trouble
they
create
him
would
remove
from
his
heart
for
ever
?
  
<EOS>
By
all
that
is
good
and
virtuous
,
if
there
are
three
drops
of
oil
to
be
got
,
and
a
hammer
to
be
found
within
ten
miles
of
Shandy
Hall
 
<EOS>
the
parlour
door
hinge
shall
be
mended
this
reign
.
    
<EOS>
When
Corporal
Trim
had
brought
his
two
mortars
to
bear
,
he
was
delighted
with
his
handy
-
work
above
measure
;
and
knowing
what
a
pleasure
it
would
be
to
his
master
to
see
them
,
he
was
not
able
to
resist
the
desire
he
had
of
carrying
them
directly
into
his
parlour
.
  
<EOS>
Now
next
to
the
moral
lesson
I
had
in
view
in
mentioning
the
affair
of
hinges
,
I
had
a
speculative
consideration
arising
out
of
it
,
and
it
is
this
.
  
<EOS>
Had
the
parlour
door
opened
and
turn'd
<EOS>
upon
its
hinges
,
as
a
door
should
do
    
<EOS>
Or
for
example
,
as
cleverly
as
our
government
has
been
turning
upon
its
hinges
 
(
that
is
,
in
case
things
have
all
along
gone
well
with
your
worship
,
 
<EOS>
otherwise
I
give
up
my
simile
)
 
in
this
case
<EOS>
,
I
say
,
there
had
been
no
danger
either
to
master
or
man
,
in
corporal
Trim
's
peeping
in
:
 
<EOS>
the
moment
he
had
beheld
my
father
and
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
fast
asleep
 
<EOS>
the
respectfulness
of
his
carriage
was
such
,
he
would
have
retired
as
silent
as
death
,
and
left
them
both
in
their
arm
-
chairs
,
dreaming
as
happy
as
he
had
found
them
:
 
but
the
thing
was
,
morally
speaking
,
so
very
impracticable
,
that
for
the
many
years
in
which
this
hinge
was
suffered
to
be
out
of
order
,
and
amongst
the
hourly
grievances
my
father
submitted
to
upon
its
account
 
this
was
one
;
that
he
never
folded
his
arms
to
take
his
nap
after
dinner
,
but
the
thoughts
of
being
unavoidably
awakened
by
the
first
person
who
should
open
the
door
,
was
always
uppermost
in
his
imagination
,
and
so
incessantly
stepp'd
<EOS>
in
betwixt
him
and
the
first
balmy
presage
of
his
repose
,
as
to
rob
him
,
as
he
often
declared
,
of
the
whole
sweets
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
things
move
upon
bad
hinges
,
an
'
please
your
lordships
,
how
can
it
be
otherwise
?
"
  
<EOS>
Pray
what
's
the
matter
?
 
<EOS>
Who
is
there
?
<EOS>
cried
my
father
,
waking
,
the
moment
the
door
began
to
creak
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
the
smith
would
give
a
peep
at
that
confounded
hinge
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
nothing
,
an
please
your
honour
,
said
Trim
,
but
two
mortars
I
am
bringing
in
.
 
<EOS>
They
sha
n't
make
a
clatter
with
them
here
,
cried
my
father
hastily
.
 
<EOS>
If
Dr.
Slop
has
any
drugs
to
pound
,
let
him
do
it
in
the
kitchen
.
 
<EOS>
May
it
please
your
honour
,
cried
Trim
,
they
are
two
mortar-
pieces
for
a
siege
next
summer
,
which
I
have
been
making
out
of
a
pair
of
jack
-
boots
,
which
Obadiah
told
me
your
honour
had
left
off
wearing
.
 
<EOS>
By
Heaven
!
<EOS>
cried
my
father
,
springing
out
of
his
chair
,
as
he
swore
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
one
appointment
belonging
to
me
,
which
I
set
so
much
store
by
as
I
do
by
these
jack
-
boots
 
<EOS>
they
were
our
great
grandfather
's
brother
<EOS>
Toby
 
<EOS>
they
were
hereditary
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
fear
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
Trim
has
cut
off
the
entail
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
only
cut
off
the
tops
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
cried
Trim
  
<EOS>
I
hate
perpetuities
as
much
as
any
man
alive
,
cried
my
father
 
but
these
jack
-
boots
,
continued
he
(
smiling
,
though
very
angry
at
the
same
time
)
<EOS>
have
been
in
the
family
,
brother
,
ever
since
the
civil
wars
;
 
Sir
Roger
Shandy
wore
them
at
the
battle
of
Marston
-
Moor
.
 
<EOS>
I
declare
I
would
not
have
taken
ten
pounds
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
pay
you
the
money
,
brother
Shandy
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
looking
at
the
two
mortars
with
infinite
pleasure
,
and
putting
his
hand
into
his
breeches
pocket
as
he
viewed
them
 
I
'll
pay
you
the
ten
pounds
this
moment
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
.
    
<EOS>
Brother
Toby
,
replied
my
father
,
altering
his
tone
,
you
care
not
what
money
you
dissipate
and
throw
away
,
<EOS>
provided
,
continued
he
,
'
tis
but
upon
a
Siege
.
 
<EOS>
Have
<EOS>
I
not
one
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
a
year
<EOS>
,
besides
my
half
pay
?
cried
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
that
 
replied
my
father
hastily
 
to
ten
pounds
for
a
pair
of
jack
-
boots
?
 
<EOS>
twelve
guineas
for
your
pontoons
?
 
<EOS>
half
as
much
for
your
Dutch
draw
-
bridge
?
 
<EOS>
to
say
nothing
of
the
train
of
little
brass
artillery
you
bespoke
last
week
,
with
twenty
other
preparations
for
the
siege
of
Messina
:
 
believe
me
,
dear
brother
Toby
,
continued
my
father
,
taking
him
kindly
by
the
hand
 
these
military
operations
of
yours
are
above
your
strength
;
 
you
mean
<EOS>
well
brother
 
<EOS>
but
they
carry
you
into
greater
expences
than
you
were
first
aware
of
;
 
and
take
my
word
,
<EOS>
dear
Toby
,
they
will
in
the
end
quite
ruin
your
fortune
,
and
make
a
beggar
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
What
signifies
it
if
they
do
,
brother
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
,
so
long
as
we
know
'
tis
for
the
good
of
the
nation
?
    
<EOS>
My
father
could
not
help
smiling
for
his
soul
 
his
anger
at
the
worst
was
never
more
than
a
spark
;
 
and
the
zeal
and
simplicity
of
Trim
 
and
<EOS>
the
generous
(
though
hobby
-
horsical
)
gallantry
of
my
uncle
Toby
,
brought
him
into
perfect
good
humour
with
them
in
an
instant
.
  
<EOS>
Generous
souls
!
 
<EOS>
God
prosper
you
both
,
and
your
mortar
-
pieces
too
!
<EOS>
quoth
my
father
to
himself
.
    
<EOS>
All
is
quiet
and
hush
,
cried
my
father
,
at
least
above
stairs
 
I
hear
not
one
foot
stirring
.
 
<EOS>
Prithee
Trim
,
who
's
in
the
kitchen
?
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
one
soul
in
the
kitchen
,
answered
Trim
,
making
a
low
bow
as
he
spoke
,
except
Dr.
Slop
.
 
<EOS>
Confusion
!
<EOS>
cried
my
father
(
getting
upon
his
legs
a
second
time
)
 
<EOS>
not
one
single
thing
has
gone
right
this
day
!
<EOS>
had
I
faith
in
astrology
,
brother
,
(
which
,
by
the
bye
,
my
father
had
)
<EOS>
I
would
have
sworn
some
retrograde
planet
was
hanging
over
this
unfortunate
house
of
mine
,
and
turning
every
individual
thing
in
it
out
of
its
place
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
thought
Dr.
Slop
had
been
above
stairs
with
my
wife
,
and
so
said
you
.
 
<EOS>
What
can
the
fellow
be
puzzling
about
in
the
kitchen
!
 
<EOS>
He
is
busy
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
replied
Trim
,
in
making
a
bridge
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
very
obliging
in
him
,
quoth
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
:
 
pray
,
give
my
humble
service
to
Dr.
Slop
,
Trim
,
and
tell
him
I
thank
him
heartily
.
  
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
my
uncle
Toby
mistook
the
bridge
 
as
widely
as
my
father
mistook
the
mortars
:
 
but
to
understand
how
my
uncle
Toby
could
mistake
the
bridge
 
<EOS>
I
fear
I
must
give
you
an
exact
account
of
the
road
which
led
to
it
;
 
or
to
drop
my
metaphor
(
for
there
is
nothing
more
dishonest
in
an
historian
than
the
use
of
one
)
 
in
order
to
conceive
the
probability
of
this
error
in
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
aright
,
I
must
give
you
some
account
of
an
adventure
of
Trim
's
,
though
much
against
my
will
<EOS>
,
I
say
much
against
my
will
,
only
because
the
story
,
in
one
sense
,
is
certainly
out
of
its
place
here
;
for
by
right
it
should
come
in
,
either
amongst
the
anecdotes
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
amours
with
widow
Wadman
,
in
which
corporal
Trim
was
no
mean
actor
 
or
else
in
the
middle
of
his
and
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
's
campaigns
on
the
bowling
-
green
 
for
it
will
do
very
well
in
either
place
;
 
but
then
if
I
reserve
it
for
either
of
those
parts
of
my
story
 
<EOS>
I
ruin
the
story
I
'm
upon
;
 
and
if
I
tell
it
here
 
I
anticipate
matters
,
and
ruin
it
there
.
    
<EOS>
What
would
your
worship
have
me
to
do
in
this
case
?
    
<EOS>
Tell
it
,
Mr.
Shandy
,
by
all
means
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
a
fool
,
Tristram
,
if
you
do
.
  
<EOS>
O
ye
powers
!
<EOS>
(
for
powers
ye
are
,
and
great
ones
too
)
 
<EOS>
which
enable
mortal
man
to
tell
a
story
worth
the
hearing
 
that
kindly
shew
him
,
where
he
is
to
begin
it
 
and
where
he
is
to
end
it
 
what
he
is
to
put
into
it
 
and
what
he
is
to
leave
out
 
how
much
of
it
he
is
to
cast
into
a
shade
 
and
whereabouts
<EOS>
he
is
to
throw
his
light
!
 
<EOS>
Ye
,
who
preside
over
this
vast
empire
of
biographical
freebooters
,
and
see
how
many
scrapes
and
plunges
your
subjects
hourly
fall
into
;
 
<EOS>
will
you
do
one
thing
?
  
<EOS>
I
beg
and
beseech
you
(
in
case
you
will
do
nothing
better
for
us
)
that
wherever
in
any
part
of
your
dominions
it
so
falls
out
,
that
three
several
roads
meet
in
one
point
,
as
they
have
done
just
here
 
that
at
least
you
set
up
a
guide
-
post
in
the
centre
of
them
,
in
mere
charity
,
to
direct
an
uncertain
devil
which
of
the
three
he
is
to
take
.
     
<EOS>
Tho
'
the
shock
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
received
the
year
after
the
demolition
of
Dunkirk
,
in
his
affair
with
widow
Wadman
,
had
fixed
him
in
a
resolution
never
more
to
think
of
the
sex
 
or
of
aught
which
belonged
to
it
;
 
yet
corporal
Trim
had
made
no
such
bargain
with
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
case
there
was
a
strange
and
unaccountable
concurrence
of
circumstances
,
which
insensibly
drew
him
in
,
to
lay
siege
to
that
fair
and
strong
citadel
.
 
<EOS>
In
Trim
's
case
there
was
a
concurrence
of
nothing
in
the
world
,
but
of
him
and
Bridget
in
the
kitchen
;
 
though
in
truth
,
the
love
and
veneration
he
bore
his
master
was
such
,
and
so
fond
was
he
of
imitating
him
in
all
he
did
,
<EOS>
that
had
my
uncle
Toby
employed
his
time
and
genius
in
tagging
of
points
 
<EOS>
I
am
persuaded
the
honest
corporal
would
have
laid
down
his
arms
,
and
followed
his
example
with
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
When
therefore
my
uncle
Toby
sat
down
before
the
mistress
 
<EOS>
corporal
Trim
incontinently
took
ground
before
the
maid
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
my
dear
friend
Garrick
,
whom
I
have
so
much
cause
to
esteem
and
honour
 
(
why
,
or
wherefore
,
'
tis
no
matter
)
 
<EOS>
can
it
escape
your
penetration
 
<EOS>
I
defy
it
 
that
so
many
play
-
wrights
,
and
opificers
of
chit-
chat
have
ever
since
been
working
upon
Trim
's
and
my
uncle
Toby
's
pattern
.
 
<EOS>
I
care
not
<EOS>
what
Aristotle
,
or
Pacuvius
,
or
Bossu
,
or
Ricaboni
say
 
<EOS>
(
though
I
never
read
one
of
them
)
 
<EOS>
there
is
not
a
greater
difference
between
a
single
-
horse
chair
and
madam
Pompadour
's
vis
-
a
-
vis
;
than
betwixt
a
single
amour
,
and
an
amour
thus
nobly
doubled
,
and
going
upon
all
four
,
prancing
throughout
a
grand
drama
 
Sir
,
a
simple
,
single
,
silly
affair
of
that
kind
 
is
quite
lost
in
five
acts
 
<EOS>
but
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
.
  
<EOS>
After
a
series
of
attacks
and
repulses
in
a
course
of
nine
months
on
my
uncle
Toby
's
quarter
,
a
most
minute
account
of
every
particular
of
which
shall
be
given
in
its
proper
place
,
my
uncle
Toby
,
honest
man
!
<EOS>
found
it
necessary
to
draw
off
his
forces
and
raise
the
siege
somewhat
indignantly
.
  
<EOS>
Corporal
Trim
,
as
I
said
,
had
made
no
such
bargain
either
with
himself
 
or
with
any
one
else
 
the
fidelity
however
of
his
heart
not
suffering
him
to
go
into
a
house
which
his
master
had
forsaken
with
disgust
 
<EOS>
he
contented
himself
with
turning
his
part
of
the
siege
into
a
blockade
;
 
that
is
,
he
kept
others
off
;
 
for
though
he
never
after
went
to
the
house
,
yet
he
never
met
Bridget
in
the
village
,
but
he
would
either
nod
or
wink
,
or
smile
,
or
look
kindly
at
her
 
<EOS>
or
(
as
circumstances
directed
)
<EOS>
he
would
shake
her
by
the
hand
 
or
ask
her
lovingly
how
she
did
 
or
would
give
her
a
ribbon
 
and
now
-
and
-
then
,
though
<EOS>
never
but
when
it
could
be
done
with
decorum
,
would
give
Bridget
a.
.
.
    
<EOS>
Precisely
in
this
situation
,
did
these
things
stand
for
five
years
;
that
is
from
the
demolition
of
Dunkirk
in
the
year
13
,
to
the
latter
end
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
campaign
in
the
year
18
,
which
was
about
six
or
seven
weeks
before
the
time
I
'm
speaking
of
.
 
<EOS>
When
Trim
,
as
his
custom
was
,
after
he
had
put
my
uncle
Toby
to
bed
,
going
down
one
moon
-
shiny
night
to
see
that
every
thing
was
right
at
his
fortifications
 
in
the
lane
separated
from
the
bowling
-
green
with
flowering
shrubs
and
holly
 
<EOS>
he
espied
his
Bridget
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
corporal
thought
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
<EOS>
so
well
worth
shewing
as
the
glorious
works
which
he
and
my
uncle
Toby
had
made
,
Trim
courteously
and
gallantly
took
her
by
the
hand
,
and
led
her
in
:
this
was
not
done
so
privately
,
but
that
the
foul
-
mouth'd
trumpet
of
Fame
carried
it
from
ear
to
ear
,
till
at
length
it
<EOS>
reach'd
<EOS>
my
father
's
,
with
this
untoward
circumstance
along
with
it
,
that
my
uncle
Toby
's
curious
draw
-
bridge
,
constructed
and
painted
after
the
Dutch
fashion
,
and
which
went
quite
across
the
ditch
 
was
broke
down
,
and
somehow
or
other
crushed
all
to
pieces
that
very
night
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
,
as
you
have
observed
,
had
no
great
esteem
for
my
uncle
Toby
's
hobby
-
horse
;
he
thought
it
the
most
ridiculous
horse
that
ever
gentleman
mounted
;
and
indeed
unless
my
uncle
Toby
vexed
him
about
it
,
could
never
think
of
it
once
,
without
smiling
at
it
 
so
that
it
could
never
get
lame
or
happen
any
mischance
,
but
it
tickled
my
father
's
imagination
beyond
measure
;
but
this
being
an
accident
much
more
to
his
humour
than
any
one
which
had
yet
<EOS>
befall'n
<EOS>
it
,
it
proved
an
inexhaustible
fund
of
entertainment
to
him
 
<EOS>
Well
 
but
<EOS>
dear
Toby
!
<EOS>
my
father
would
say
,
do
tell
me
seriously
how
this
affair
of
the
bridge
happened
.
 
<EOS>
How
can
you
teaze
me
so
much
about
it
?
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
would
reply
 
<EOS>
I
have
told
it
you
twenty
times
,
word
for
word
as
Trim
told
it
me
.
 
<EOS>
Prithee
<EOS>
,
how
was
it
then
,
corporal
?
<EOS>
my
father
would
cry
,
turning
to
Trim
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
mere
misfortune
,
an
'
please
your
honour
;
 
I
was
shewing
Mrs.
Bridget
our
fortifications
,
and
in
going
too
near
the
edge
of
the
fosse
,
I
unfortunately
slipp'd
in
 
Very
well
,
Trim
!
<EOS>
my
father
would
cry
 
(
smiling
mysteriously
,
and
giving
a
nod
 
but
without
interrupting
him
)
 
and
being
link'd
fast
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
arm
in
arm
with
Mrs.
Bridget
,
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
dragg'd
her
after
me
,
by
means
of
which
she
fell
backwards
soss
against
the
bridge
 
and
Trim
's
foot
(
my
uncle
Toby
would
cry
,
taking
the
story
out
of
his
mouth
)
<EOS>
getting
into
the
cuvette
,
he
tumbled
full
against
the
bridge
too
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
thousand
to
one
,
my
uncle
Toby
would
add
,
that
the
poor
fellow
did
not
break
his
leg
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
<EOS>
truly
,
my
father
would
say
 
a
limb
is
soon
broke
,
brother
Toby
,
in
such
encounters
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
the
bridge
,
which
your
honour
knows
was
a
very
slight
one
,
was
broke
down
betwixt
us
,
and
splintered
all
to
pieces
.
  
<EOS>
At
other
times
,
but
especially
when
my
uncle
Toby
was
so
unfortunate
as
to
say
a
syllable
about
cannons
,
bombs
,
or
petards
 
<EOS>
my
father
would
exhaust
all
the
stores
of
his
eloquence
(
which
indeed
were
very
great
)
in
a
panegyric
upon
the
Battering
-
Rams
of
the
ancients
 
the
Vinea
which
Alexander
made
use
of
at
the
siege
of
Troy
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
tell
my
uncle
Toby
of
the
Catapultae
of
the
Syrians
,
which
threw
such
monstrous
stones
so
many
hundred
feet
,
and
shook
the
strongest
bulwarks
from
their
very
foundation
:
 
he
would
go
on
and
describe
the
wonderful
mechanism
of
the
Ballista
which
Marcellinus
makes
so
much
rout
about
!
 
<EOS>
the
terrible
effects
of
the
Pyraboli
,
which
cast
fire
;
 
the
danger
of
the
Terebra
and
Scorpio
,
which
cast
javelins
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
are
these
,
would
he
say
,
to
the
destructive
machinery
of
corporal
Trim
?
 
<EOS>
Believe
me
,
brother
Toby
,
no
bridge
,
or
bastion
,
or
sally
-
port
,
that
ever
was
constructed
in
this
world
,
can
hold
out
against
such
artillery
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
would
never
attempt
any
defence
against
the
force
of
this
ridicule
,
but
that
of
redoubling
the
vehemence
of
smoaking
his
pipe
;
in
doing
which
,
he
raised
so
dense
a
vapour
one
night
after
supper
,
that
it
set
my
father
,
who
was
a
little
phthisical
,
into
a
suffocating
fit
of
violent
coughing
:
 
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
leap'd
up
without
feeling
the
pain
upon
his
groin
 
and
,
with
infinite
pity
,
stood
beside
his
brother
's
chair
,
tapping
his
back
with
one
hand
,
and
holding
his
head
with
the
other
,
and
from
time
to
time
wiping
his
eyes
with
a
clean
cambrick
handkerchief
,
which
he
pulled
out
of
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
The
affectionate
and
endearing
manner
in
which
my
uncle
Toby
did
these
little
offices
 
<EOS>
cut
my
father
thro
'
his
reins
,
for
the
pain
he
had
just
been
giving
him
.
 
<EOS>
May
my
brains
be
knock'd
out
with
a
battering
-
ram
or
a
catapulta
,
I
care
not
which
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
father
to
himself
 
<EOS>
if
ever
I
insult
this
worthy
soul
more
!
    
<EOS>
The
draw
-
bridge
being
held
irreparable
,
Trim
was
ordered
directly
to
set
about
another
 
but
not
upon
the
same
model
:
 
for
cardinal
Alberoni
's
intrigues
at
that
time
being
discovered
,
and
my
uncle
Toby
rightly
foreseeing
that
a
flame
would
inevitably
break
out
betwixt
Spain
and
the
Empire
,
and
that
the
operations
of
the
ensuing
campaign
must
in
all
likelihood
be
either
in
Naples
or
Sicily
 
he
determined
upon
an
Italian
bridge
 
(
my
uncle
Toby
,
by
-
the
-
bye
,
was
not
far
out
of
his
conjectures
)
  
but
my
father
,
who
was
infinitely
the
better
politician
,
and
took
the
lead
as
far
of
my
uncle
Toby
in
the
cabinet
,
as
my
uncle
Toby
took
it
of
him
in
the
field
 
convinced
him
,
that
if
the
king
of
Spain
and
the
Emperor
went
together
by
the
ears
,
England
and
France
and
Holland
must
,
by
force
of
their
pre
-
engagements
,
all
enter
the
lists
too
;
 
and
if
so
,
he
would
say
,
the
combatants
,
brother
Toby
,
<EOS>
as
sure
as
we
are
alive
,
will
fall
to
it
again
,
pell
-
mell
,
upon
the
old
prize
-
fighting
stage
of
Flanders
;
 
then
what
will
you
do
with
your
Italian
bridge
?
    
<EOS>
We
will
go
on
with
it
then
upon
the
old
model
,
cried
my
uncle
Toby
.
  
<EOS>
When
corporal
Trim
had
about
half
finished
it
in
that
style
 
my
uncle
Toby
found
out
a
capital
defect
in
it
,
which
he
had
never
thoroughly
considered
before
.
 
<EOS>
It
turned
,
it
seems
,
upon
hinges
at
both
ends
of
it
,
opening
in
the
middle
,
one
half
of
which
turning
to
one
side
of
the
fosse
,
and
the
other
to
the
other
;
the
advantage
of
which
was
this
,
that
by
dividing
the
weight
of
the
bridge
into
two
equal
portions
,
it
impowered
my
uncle
Toby
to
raise
it
up
or
let
it
down
with
the
end
of
his
crutch
,
and
with
one
hand
,
which
,
as
his
garrison
was
weak
,
was
as
much
as
he
could
well
spare
 
but
the
disadvantages
of
such
a
construction
were
insurmountable
;
 
for
by
this
means
,
he
would
say
,
I
leave
one
half
of
my
bridge
in
my
enemy
's
possession
 
and
pray
of
what
use
is
the
other
?
  
<EOS>
The
natural
remedy
for
this
was
,
no
doubt
,
to
have
his
bridge
fast
only
at
one
end
with
hinges
,
so
that
the
whole
might
be
lifted
up
together
,
and
stand
bolt
upright
 
<EOS>
but
that
was
rejected
for
the
reason
given
above
.
  
<EOS>
For
a
whole
week
after
he
was
determined
in
his
mind
to
have
one
of
that
particular
construction
which
is
made
to
draw
back
horizontally
,
to
hinder
a
passage
;
and
to
thrust
forwards
again
to
gain
a
passage
 
of
which
sorts
your
worship
might
have
seen
three
famous
ones
at
Spires
before
its
destruction
 
and
one
now
at
Brisac
,
if
I
mistake
not
;
 
but
my
father
advising
my
uncle
Toby
,
with
great
earnestness
,
to
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
thrusting
bridges
 
and
my
uncle
foreseeing
moreover
that
it
would
but
perpetuate
the
memory
of
the
Corporal
's
misfortune
 
he
changed
his
mind
for
that
of
the
marquis
d'Hopital
's
invention
,
which
the
younger
Bernouilli
has
so
well
and
learnedly
described
,
as
your
worships
may
see
 
Act

to
these
a
lead
weight
is
an
eternal
balance
,
and
keeps
watch
as
well
as
a
couple
of
centinels
,
inasmuch
as
the
construction
of
them
was
a
curve
line
approximating
to
a
cycloid
 
if
not
a
cycloid
itself
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
understood
the
nature
of
a
parabola
as
well
as
any
man
in
England
 
but
was
not
quite
such
a
master
of
the
cycloid
;
 
he
talked
however
about
it
every
day
 
the
bridge
went
not
forwards
.
 
<EOS>
We
'll
ask
somebody
about
it
,
cried
my
uncle
Toby
to
Trim
.
    
<EOS>
When
Trim
came
in
and
told
my
father
,
that
Dr.
Slop
was
in
the
kitchen
,
and
busy
in
making
a
bridge
 
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
the
affair
of
the
jack
-
boots
having
just
then
raised
a
train
of
military
ideas
in
his
brain
 
<EOS>
took
it
instantly
for
granted
that
Dr.
Slop
was
making
a
model
of
the
marquis
d'Hopital
's
bridge
.
 
<EOS>
'
tis
very
obliging
in
him
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
;
 
<EOS>
pray
give
my
humble
service
to
Dr.
Slop
,
Trim
,
and
tell
him
I
thank
him
heartily
.
  
<EOS>
Had
my
uncle
Toby
's
head
been
a
Savoyard
's
box
,
and
my
father
peeping
in
all
the
time
at
one
end
of
it
 
<EOS>
it
could
not
have
given
him
a
more
distinct
conception
of
the
operations
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
imagination
,
than
what
he
had
;
so
,
notwithstanding
the
catapulta
and
battering
-
ram
,
and
his
bitter
imprecation
about
them
,
he
was
just
beginning
to
triumph
    
<EOS>
When
Trim
's
answer
,
in
an
instant
,
tore
the
laurel
from
his
brows
,
and
twisted
it
to
pieces
.
      
<EOS>
This
unfortunate
draw
-
bridge
of
yours
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
father
 
God
bless
your
honour
,
cried
Trim
,
'
tis
a
bridge
for
master
's
nose
.
 
<EOS>
In
bringing
him
into
the
world
with
his
vile
instruments
,
he
has
crushed
his
nose
,
Susannah
says
,
as
flat
as
a
pancake
to
his
face
,
and
he
is
making
a
false
bridge
with
a
piece
of
cotton
and
a
thin
piece
of
whalebone
out
of
Susannah
's
stays
,
to
raise
it
up
.
    
<EOS>
Lead
me
,
brother
Toby
,
cried
my
father
,
to
my
room
this
instant
.
    
<EOS>
From
the
first
moment
I
sat
down
to
write
my
life
for
the
amusement
of
the
world
,
and
my
opinions
for
its
instruction
,
has
a
cloud
insensibly
been
gathering
over
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
A
tide
of
little
evils
and
distresses
has
been
setting
in
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
Not
one
thing
,
as
he
observed
himself
,
has
gone
right
:
 
and
now
is
the
storm
thicken'd
and
going
to
break
,
and
pour
down
full
upon
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
I
enter
upon
this
part
of
my
story
in
the
most
pensive
and
melancholy
frame
of
mind
that
ever
sympathetic
breast
was
touched
with
.
 
<EOS>
My
nerves
relax
as
I
tell
it
.
 
<EOS>
Every
line
I
write
,
I
feel
an
abatement
of
the
quickness
of
my
pulse
,
and
of
that
careless
alacrity
with
it
,
which
every
day
of
my
life
prompts
me
to
say
and
write
a
thousand
things
I
should
not
 
<EOS>
And
this
moment
that
I
last
dipp'd
my
pen
into
my
ink
,
I
could
not
help
taking
notice
what
a
cautious
air
of
sad
composure
and
solemnity
there
appear'd
<EOS>
in
my
manner
of
doing
it
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
how
different
from
the
rash
jerks
and
hair
-
brain'd
squirts
thou
art
wo
nt
,
Tristram
,
to
transact
it
with
in
other
humours
  
<EOS>
dropping
thy
pen
 
<EOS>
spurting
thy
ink
about
thy
table
and
thy
books
 
as
if
thy
pen
and
thy
ink
,
thy
books
and
furniture
cost
thee
nothing
!
      
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
go
about
to
argue
the
point
with
you
 
<EOS>
'
tis
<EOS>
so
 
<EOS>
and
I
am
persuaded
of
it
,
<EOS>
madam
,
as
much
as
can
be
,
"
That
both
man
and
woman
bear
pain
or
sorrow
(
and
,
for
aught
I
know
,
pleasure
too
)
best
in
a
horizontal
position
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
moment
my
father
got
up
into
his
chamber
,
he
threw
himself
prostrate
across
his
bed
in
the
wildest
disorder
imaginable
,
but
at
the
same
time
in
the
most
lamentable
attitude
of
a
man
borne
down
with
sorrows
,
that
ever
the
eye
of
pity
dropp'd
<EOS>
a
tear
for
.
 
<EOS>
The
palm
of
his
right
hand
,
as
he
fell
upon
the
bed
,
receiving
his
forehead
,
and
covering
the
greatest
part
of
both
his
eyes
,
gently
sunk
down
with
his
head
(
his
elbow
giving
way
backwards
)
till
his
nose
touch'd
<EOS>
the
quilt
;
 
<EOS>
his
left
arm
hung
insensible
over
the
side
of
the
bed
<EOS>
,
his
knuckles
reclining
upon
the
handle
of
the
chamber
-
pot
,
which
peep'd
out
beyond
the
valance
 
his
right
leg
(
his
left
being
drawn
up
towards
his
body
)
hung
half
over
the
side
of
the
bed
,
the
edge
of
it
pressing
upon
his
shin
bone
 
<EOS>
He
felt
it
not
.
 
<EOS>
A
fix'd
,
inflexible
sorrow
took
possession
of
every
line
of
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
He
<EOS>
sigh'd
<EOS>
once
 
heaved
his
breast
often
 
but
uttered
not
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
An
old
set
-
stitch'd
chair
,
valanced
and
fringed
around
with
party
coloured
worsted
bobs
,
stood
at
the
bed
's
head
,
opposite
to
the
side
where
my
father
's
head
reclined
.
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
sat
him
down
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
Before
an
affliction
is
digested
 
consolation
ever
comes
too
soon
;
 
and
after
it
is
digested
 
<EOS>
it
comes
too
late
:
 
so
that
you
see
,
<EOS>
madam
,
there
is
but
a
mark
between
these
two
,
as
fine
almost
as
a
hair
,
for
a
comforter
to
take
aim
at
:
 
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
was
always
either
on
this
side
,
or
on
that
of
it
,
and
would
often
say
,
he
believed
in
his
heart
he
could
as
soon
hit
the
longitude
;
for
this
reason
,
when
he
sat
down
in
the
chair
,
he
drew
the
curtain
a
little
forwards
,
and
having
a
tear
at
every
one
's
service
 
he
pull'd
out
<EOS>
a
cambrick
handkerchief
 
gave
a
low
sigh
 
but
held
his
peace
.
      
<EOS>
"
All
is
not
gain
that
is
got
into
the
purse
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
that
notwithstanding
my
father
had
the
happiness
of
reading
the
oddest
books
in
the
universe
,
and
had
moreover
,
in
himself
,
the
oddest
way
of
thinking
that
ever
man
in
it
was
bless'd
with
,
yet
it
had
this
drawback
upon
him
after
all
 
that
it
laid
him
open
to
some
of
the
oddest
and
most
whimsical
distresses
;
of
which
this
particular
one
,
which
he
sunk
under
at
present
,
is
as
strong
an
example
as
can
be
given
.
  
<EOS>
No
doubt
,
the
breaking
down
of
the
bridge
of
a
child
's
nose
,
by
the
edge
of
a
pair
of
forceps
 
however
scientifically
applied
 
would
vex
any
man
in
the
world
,
who
was
at
so
much
pains
in
begetting
a
child
,
as
my
father
was
 
<EOS>
yet
it
will
not
account
for
the
extravagance
of
his
affliction
,
nor
will
it
justify
the
un
-
christian
manner
he
abandoned
and
surrendered
himself
up
to
.
  
<EOS>
To
explain
this
,
I
must
leave
him
upon
the
bed
for
half
an
hour
 
and
my
uncle
Toby
in
his
old
fringed
chair
sitting
beside
him
.
      
<EOS>
I
think
it
a
very
unreasonable
demand
 
cried
my
great
-
grandfather
,
twisting
up
the
paper
,
and
throwing
it
upon
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
account
,
madam
,
you
have
but
two
thousand
pounds
fortune
,
and
not
a
shilling
more
  
<EOS>
and
you
insist
upon
having
three
hundred
pounds
a
year
jointure
for
it
.
      
<EOS>
"
Because
,
"
replied
my
great
-
grandmother
,
"
you
have
little
or
no
nose
,
Sir
.
"
    
<EOS>
Now
before
I
venture
to
make
use
of
the
word
Nose
a
second
time
 
to
avoid
all
confusion
in
what
will
be
said
upon
it
,
in
this
interesting
part
of
my
story
,
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
explain
my
own
meaning
,
and
define
,
with
all
possible
exactness
and
precision
,
what
I
would
willingly
be
understood
to
mean
by
the
term
:
 
being
of
opinion
,
that
'
tis
owing
to
the
negligence
and
perverseness
of
writers
in
despising
this
precaution
,
and
to
nothing
else
  
that
all
the
polemical
writings
in
divinity
are
not
as
clear
and
demonstrative
as
those
upon
a
Will
o
'
the
Wisp
,
or
any
other
sound
part
of
philosophy
,
and
natural
pursuit
;
in
order
to
which
,
what
have
you
to
do
,
before
you
set
out
,
unless
you
intend
to
go
puzzling
on
to
the
day
of
judgment
 
but
to
give
the
world
a
good
definition
,
and
stand
to
it
,
of
the
main
word
you
have
most
occasion
for
 
changing
it
,
Sir
,
as
you
would
a
guinea
,
into
small
coin
?
 
which
done
 
let
the
father
of
confusion
puzzle
you
,
if
he
can
;
or
put
a
different
idea
either
into
your
head
,
or
your
reader
's
head
,
if
he
knows
how
.
  
In
books
of
strict
morality
and
close
reasoning
,
such
as
I
am
engaged
in
  
the
neglect
is
inexcusable
;
and
Heaven
is
witness
,
how
the
world
has
revenged
itself
upon
me
for
leaving
so
many
openings
to
equivocal
strictures
 
and
for
depending
so
much
as
I
have
done
,
all
along
,
upon
the
cleanliness
of
my
readers
imaginations
.
    
<EOS>
Here
are
two
senses
,
cried
Eugenius
,
as
we
walk'd
along
,
pointing
with
the
fore
finger
of
his
right
hand
to
the
word
Crevice
,
in
the
one
hundred
and
seventy
-
eighth
page
of
the
first
volume
of
this
book
of
books
<EOS>
,
 
here
are
two
senses
 
quoth
he
.
 
<EOS>
And
here
are
two
roads
,
replied
I
,
turning
short
upon
him
 
a
dirty
and
a
clean
one
 
which
shall
we
take
?
 
<EOS>
The
clean
,
by
all
means
,
replied
Eugenius
.
 
<EOS>
Eugenius
,
said
I
,
stepping
before
him
,
and
laying
my
hand
upon
his
breast
 
to
define
 
is
to
distrust
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
I
triumph'd
over
Eugenius
;
but
I
<EOS>
triumph'd
over
him
as
I
always
do
,
like
a
fool
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
my
comfort
,
however
,
I
am
not
an
obstinate
one
:
 
therefore
  
I
define
a
nose
as
follows
 
intreating
only
beforehand
,
and
beseeching
my
readers
,
both
male
and
female
,
of
what
age
,
complexion
,
and
condition
soever
,
for
the
love
of
God
and
their
own
souls
,
to
guard
against
the
temptations
and
suggestions
of
the
devil
,
and
suffer
him
by
no
art
or
wile
to
put
any
other
ideas
into
their
minds
,
than
what
I
put
into
my
definition
 
For
by
the
word
Nose
,
throughout
all
this
long
chapter
of
noses
,
and
in
every
other
part
of
my
work
,
where
the
word
Nose
occurs
 
<EOS>
I
declare
,
by
that
word
<EOS>
I
mean
a
nose
,
and
nothing
more
,
or
less
.
      
<EOS>
"
Because
,
"
quoth
my
great
grandmother
,
repeating
the
words
again
 
"
you
have
little
or
no
nose
,
Sir
.
"
    
S'death
!
<EOS>
cried
my
great
-
grandfather
,
clapping
his
hand
upon
his
nose
,
 
'
tis
not
so
small
as
that
comes
to
;
 
'
tis
a
full
inch
longer
than
my
father
's
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
my
great
-
grandfather
's
nose
was
for
all
the
world
like
unto
the
noses
of
all
the
men
,
women
,
and
children
,
whom
Pantagruel
found
dwelling
upon
the
island
of
Ennasin
.
 
<EOS>
By
the
way
,
if
you
would
know
the
strange
way
of
getting
a
-
kin
amongst
<EOS>
so
flat
-
nosed
a
people
 
<EOS>
you
must
read
the
book
;
 
find
it
out
yourself
,
you
never
can
.
      
<EOS>
'
Twas
shaped
,
Sir
,
like
an
ace
of
clubs

<EOS>
'
<EOS>
Tis
a
full
inch
,
continued
my
grandfather
,
pressing
up
the
ridge
of
his
nose
with
his
finger
and
thumb
;
and
repeating
his
assertion
 
'
tis
a
full
inch
longer
,
madam
,
than
my
father
's
 
<EOS>
You
must
mean
your
uncle
's
,
replied
my
great
-
grandmother
.
    
<EOS>
My
great
-
grandfather
was
convinced
.
 
<EOS>
He
untwisted
the
paper
,
and
signed
the
article
.
      
<EOS>
What
an
unconscionable
jointure
,
my
dear
,
do
we
pay
out
of
this
small
estate
of
ours
,
<EOS>
quoth
my
grandmother
to
my
grandfather
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
,
replied
my
grandfather
,
had
no
more
nose
,
my
dear
,
saving
the
mark
,
than
there
is
upon
the
back
of
my

<EOS>
Now
,
you
must
know

that

grandmother
outlived
my
grandfather
twelve
years
;
so
that
my
father
had
the
jointure
to
pay
,
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
<EOS>
half
-
yearly
 
<EOS>
(
on
Michaelmas
and
Lady
-
day
,
)
 
during
all
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
No
man
discharged
pecuniary
obligations
with
a
better
grace
than
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
far
as
a
hundred
pounds
went
,
he
would
fling
it
upon
the
table
,
guinea
by
guinea
,
with
that
spirited
jerk
of
an
honest
welcome
,
which
generous
souls
,
and
generous
souls
only
,
are
able
to
fling
down
money
:
 
<EOS>
but
as
soon
as
ever
he
enter'd
upon
the
odd
fifty
 
he
generally
gave
a
loud
Hem
!
<EOS>
rubb'd
<EOS>
the
side
of
his
nose
leisurely
with
the
flat
part
of
his
fore
finger
 
inserted
his
hand
cautiously
betwixt
his
head
and
the
cawl
of
his
wig
 
<EOS>
look'd
<EOS>
at
both
sides
of
every
guinea
as
he
parted
with
it
 
and
seldom
could
get
to
the
end
of
the
fifty
pounds
,
without
pulling
out
his
handkerchief
,
and
wiping
his
temples
.
  
<EOS>
Defend
me
,
gracious
Heaven
!
<EOS>
from
those
persecuting
spirits
who
make
no
allowances
for
these
workings
within
us
.
 
<EOS>
Never
 
O
never
may
I
lay
down
in
their
tents
,
who
can
not
relax
the
engine
,
and
feel
pity
for
the
force
of
education
,
and
the
prevalence
of
opinions
long
derived
from
ancestors
!
  
<EOS>
For
three
generations
at
least
this
tenet
in
favour
of
long
noses
had
gradually
been
taking
root
in
our
family
.
 
<EOS>
Tradition
was
all
along
on
its
side
,
and
Interest
was
every
half
-
year
stepping
in
to
strengthen
it
;
so
that
the
whimsicality
of
my
father
's
brain
was
far
from
having
the
whole
honour
of
this
,
as
it
had
of
almost
all
his
other
strange
notions
.
 
<EOS>
For
in
a
great
measure
he
might
be
said
to
have
suck'd
<EOS>
this
in
with
his
mother
's
milk
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
his
part
however
.
 
<EOS>
If
education
planted
the
mistake
(
in
case
it
was
one
)
<EOS>
my
father
watered
it
,
and
ripened
it
to
perfection
.
  
<EOS>
He
would
often
declare
,
in
speaking
his
thoughts
upon
the
subject
,
that
he
did
not
conceive
how
the
greatest
family
in
England
could
stand
it
out
against
an
uninterrupted
succession
of
six
or
seven
short
noses
.
 
<EOS>
And
for
the
contrary
reason
,
he
would
generally
add
,
That
it
must
be
one
of
the
greatest
problems
in
civil
life
,
where
the
same
number
of
long
and
jolly
noses
,
following
one
another
in
a
direct
line
,
did
not
raise
and
hoist
it
up
into
the
best
vacancies
in
the
kingdom
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
often
boast
that
the
Shandy
family
rank'd
very
high
in
king
Harry
the
VIIIth
's
time
,
but
owed
its
rise
to
no
state
engine
 
he
would
say
 
but
to
that
only
;
 
but
that
,
like
other
families
,
he
would
add
 
it
had
felt
the
turn
of
the
wheel
,
and
had
never
recovered
the
blow
of
my
great
-
grandfather
's
nose
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
an
ace
of
clubs
indeed
,
he
would
cry
,
shaking
his
head
 
and
as
vile
a
one
for
an
unfortunate
family
as
ever
turn'd
up
trumps
.
    
<EOS>
Fair
and
softly
,
gentle
reader
!
 
<EOS>
where
is
thy
fancy
carrying
thee
!
 
<EOS>
If
there
is
truth
in
man
,
by
my
great
-
grandfather
's
nose
,
I
mean
the
external
organ
of
smelling
,
or
that
part
of
man
which
stands
prominent
in
his
face
  
and
which
painters
say
,
in
good
jolly
noses
and
well
-
proportioned
faces
,
should
comprehend
a
full
third
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
measured
downwards
from
the
setting
on
of
the
hair
.
    
<EOS>
What
a
life
of
it
has
an
author
,
at
this
pass
!
    
<EOS>
It
is
a
singular
blessing
,
that
nature
has
<EOS>
form'd
<EOS>
the
mind
of
man
with
the
same
happy
backwardness
and
renitency
against
conviction
,
which
is
observed
in
old
dogs
 
"
of
not
learning
new
tricks
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
What
a
shuttlecock
of
a
fellow
would
the
greatest
philosopher
that
ever
existed
be
<EOS>
whisk'd
into
at
once
,
did
he
read
such
books
,
and
observe
such
facts
,
and
think
such
thoughts
,
as
would
eternally
be
making
him
change
sides
!
  
<EOS>
Now
,
my
father
,
as
I
told
you
last
year
,
detested
all
this
 
<EOS>
He
pick'd
up
an
opinion
,
Sir
,
as
a
man
in
a
state
of
nature
picks
up
an
apple
.
 
<EOS>
It
becomes
his
own
 
<EOS>
and
if
he
is
a
man
of
spirit
,
he
would
lose
his
life
rather
than
give
it
up
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
aware
that
Didius
,
the
great
civilian
,
will
contest
this
point
;
and
cry
out
against
me
<EOS>
,
Whence
comes
this
man
's
right
to
this
apple
?
<EOS>
ex
confesso
,
he
will
say
 
things
were
in
a
state
of
nature
 
<EOS>
The
apple
,
is
as
much
Frank
's
apple
as
John
's
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
Mr.
Shandy
,
what
patent
has
he
to
shew
for
it
?
<EOS>
and
how
did
it
begin
to
be
his
?
<EOS>
was
it
,
when
he
set
his
heart
upon
it
?
<EOS>
or
when
he
gathered
it
?
<EOS>
or
when
he
<EOS>
chew'd
it
?
<EOS>
or
when
he
roasted
it
?
<EOS>
or
when
he
peel'd
,
or
when
he
brought
it
home
?
<EOS>
or
when
he
digested
?
 
<EOS>
or
when
he
 
?
 
<EOS>
For
'
tis
plain
,
Sir
,
if
the
first
picking
up
of
the
apple
,
made
it
not
his
 
that
no
subsequent
act
could
.
  
<EOS>
Brother
Didius
,
Tribonius
will
answer
 
<EOS>
(
now
Tribonius
the
civilian
and
church
lawyer
's
beard
being
three
inches
and
a
half
and
three
<EOS>
eighths
longer
than
Didius
his
beard
 
<EOS>
I
'm
glad
he
takes
up
the
cudgels
for
me
,
so
I
give
myself
no
farther
trouble
about
the
answer
.
)
 
<EOS>
Brother
Didius
,
Tribonius
will
say
,
it
is
a
decreed
case
,
as
you
may
find
it
in
the
fragments
of
Gregorius
and
Hermogines
's
codes
,
and
in
all
the
codes
from
Justinian
's
down
to
the
codes
of
Louis
and
Des
Eaux
 
That
the
sweat
of
a
man
's
brows
,
and
the
exsudations
of
a
man
's
brains
,
are
as
much
a
man
's
own
property
as
the
breeches
upon
his
backside
;
 
which
said
exsudations
,
&
c.
being
dropp'd
<EOS>
upon
the
said
apple
by
the
labour
of
finding
it
,
and
picking
it
up
;
and
being
moreover
indissolubly
wasted
,
and
as
indissolubly
annex'd
,
by
the
picker
up
,
to
the
thing
pick'd
up
,
carried
home
,
roasted
,
peel'd
,
eaten
,
digested
,
and
so
on
;
 
'
tis
evident
that
the
gatherer
of
the
apple
,
in
so
doing
,
has
mix'd
up
something
which
was
his
own
,
with
the
apple
which
was
not
his
own
,
by
which
means
he
has
acquired
a
property
;
 
or
,
in
other
words
,
the
apple
is
John
's
apple
.
  
<EOS>
By
the
same
learned
chain
of
reasoning
my
father
stood
up
for
all
his
opinions
;
he
had
spared
no
pains
in
picking
them
up
,
and
the
more
they
lay
out
of
the
common
way
,
the
better
still
was
his
title
.
 
<EOS>
No
mortal
claimed
them
;
they
had
cost
him
moreover
as
much
labour
in
cooking
and
digesting
as
in
the
case
above
,
so
that
they
might
well
and
truly
be
said
to
be
of
his
own
goods
and
chattels
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
he
held
fast
by
'em
,
both
by
teeth
and
claws
 
would
fly
to
whatever
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
 
and
,
in
a
word
,
would
intrench
and
fortify
them
round
with
as
many
circumvallations
and
breast
-
works
,
as
my
uncle
Toby
would
a
citadel
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
one
plaguy
rub
in
the
way
of
this
 
the
scarcity
of
materials
to
make
any
thing
of
a
defence
with
,
in
case
of
a
smart
attack
;
inasmuch
as
few
men
of
great
genius
had
exercised
their
parts
in
writing
books
upon
the
subject
of
great
noses
:
 
by
the
trotting
of
my
lean
horse
,
the
thing
is
incredible
!
<EOS>
and
I
am
quite
lost
in
my
understanding
,
when
I
am
considering
what
a
treasure
of
precious
time
and
talents
together
has
been
wasted
upon
worse
subjects
 
and
<EOS>
how
many
millions
of
books
in
all
languages
and
in
all
possible
types
and
bindings
,
have
been
fabricated
upon
points
not
half
so
much
tending
to
the
unity
and
peace
-
making
of
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
What
was
to
be
had
,
however
,
he
set
the
greater
store
by
;
and
though
my
father
would
oft-
times
sport
with
my
uncle
Toby
's
library
 
<EOS>
which
,
by
-
the
-
bye
,
was
ridiculous
enough
 
yet
at
the
very
same
time
he
did
it
,
he
collected
every
book
and
treatise
which
had
been
systematically
wrote
upon
noses
,
with
as
much
care
as
my
honest
uncle
Toby
had
done
those
upon
military
architecture
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
true
,
a
much
less
table
would
have
held
them
 
<EOS>
but
that
was
not
thy
transgression
,
my
dear
uncle
.
    
<EOS>
Here
 
<EOS>
but
why
here
 
rather
than
in
any
other
part
of
my
story
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
able
to
tell
:
 
<EOS>
but
here
it
is
 
my
heart
stops
me
to
pay
to
thee
,
my
dear
uncle
Toby
,
once
for
all
,
the
tribute
I
owe
thy
goodness
.
 
<EOS>
Here
let
me
thrust
my
chair
aside
,
and
kneel
down
upon
the
ground
,
whilst
I
am
pouring
forth
the
warmest
sentiment
of
love
for
thee
,
and
veneration
for
the
excellency
of
thy
character
,
that
ever
virtue
and
nature
kindled
in
a
nephew
's
bosom
.
 
<EOS>
Peace
and
comfort
rest
for
evermore
upon
thy
head

<EOS>
Thou
enviedst
no
man
's
comforts
 
<EOS>
insultedst
no
man

<EOS>
Thou
blackenedst
no

devouredst
no

:
 
gently
,
with
faithful
Trim
behind
thee
,
didst
thou
amble
<EOS>
round
the
little
circle
of
thy
pleasures
,
jostling
no
creature
in
thy

for

thou
hadst
<EOS>
a

for
each

need
<EOS>

thou
hadst

thy

My
father
's
collection
was
not
great
,
but
to
make
amends
,
it
was
curious
;
and
consequently
he
was
some
time
in
making
it
;
he
had
the
great
good
fortune
hewever
,
to
set
off
well
,
in
getting
Bruscambille
's
prologue
upon
long
noses
,
almost
for
nothing
 
for
he
gave
no
more
for
Bruscambille
than
three
half
-
crowns
;
owing
indeed
to
the
strong
fancy
which
the
stall
-
man
saw
my
father
had
for
the
book
<EOS>
the
moment
he
laid
his
hands
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
not
three
Bruscambilles
in
Christendom
 
<EOS>
said
the
stall
-
man
,
except
what
are
chain'd
up
in
the
libraries
of
the
curious
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
flung
down
the
money
as
quick
as
lightning
 
took
Bruscambille
into
his
bosom
 
hied
home
from
Piccadilly
to
Coleman
-
street
with
it
,
as
he
would
have
hied
home
with
a
treasure
,
without
taking
his
hand
once
off
from
Bruscambille
all
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
To
those
who
do
not
yet
know
of
which
gender
<EOS>
Bruscambille
is
 
inasmuch
as
a
prologue
upon
long
noses
might
easily
be
done
by
<EOS>
either
 
'
twill
be
no
objection
against
the
simile
 
to
say
,
That
when
my
father
got
home
,
he
solaced
himself
with
Bruscambille
after
the
manner
in
which
,
'
tis
ten
to
one
,
your
worship
solaced
yourself
with
your
first
mistress
 
that
is
,
from
morning
even
unto
night
:
 
<EOS>
which
,
by
-
the

bye
<EOS>
,
how
delightful
soever
<EOS>
it
may
prove
to
the
inamorato
 
is
of
little
or
no
entertainment
at
all
to
by-
standers
.
 
<EOS>
Take
notice
,
I
go
no
farther
with
the
simile
 
<EOS>
my
father
's
eye
was
greater
than
his
appetite
 
<EOS>
his
zeal
greater
than
his
knowledge
 
<EOS>
he
<EOS>
cool'd
 
<EOS>
his
affections
became
divided
 
<EOS>
he
got
hold
of
Prignitz
 
purchased
Scroderus
,
<EOS>
Andrea
Paraeus
,
Bouchet
's
Evening
Conferences
,
and
above
all
,
the
great
and
learned
Hafen
Slawkenbergius
;
of
which
,
as
I
shall
have
much
to
say
by
-
and

bye
 
<EOS>
I
will
say
nothing
now
.
    
<EOS>
Of
all
the
tracts
my
father
was
at
the
pains
to
procure
and
study
in
support
of
his
hypothesis
,
there
was
not
any
one
wherein
he
felt
a
more
cruel
disappointment
at
first
,
than
in
the
celebrated
dialogue
between
Pamphagus
and
Cocles
,
written
by
the
chaste
pen
of
the
great
and
venerable
Erasmus
,
upon
the
various
uses
and
seasonable
applications
of
long
noses
.

Now

n't

Satan

rising
ground

astride

any

The
doctrine
,
you
see
,
was
laid
down
by
Erasmus
,
as
my
father
wished
it
,
with
the
utmost
plainness
;
but
my
father
's
disappointment
was
,
in
finding
nothing
more
from
so
able
a
pen
,
but
the
bare
fact
itself
;
without
any
of
that
speculative
subtilty
or
ambidexterity
of
argumentation
upon
it
,
which
Heaven
had
bestow'd
upon
man
on
purpose
to
investigate
truth
,
and
fight
for
her
on
all
sides
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
pish'd
and
pugh'd
at
first
most
terribly
 
'
tis
worth
something
to
have
a
good

<EOS>
As
the
dialogue
was
of
Erasmus
,
my
father
soon
came
to
himself
,
and
read
it
over
and
over
again
with
great
application
,
studying
every
word
and
every
syllable
of
it
thro
"
and
thro
'
in
its
most
strict
and
literal
interpretation
 
<EOS>
he
could
still
make
nothing
of
it
,
that
way
.
 
<EOS>
Mayhap
<EOS>
there
is
more
meant
,
than
is
said
in
it
,
quoth
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
Learned
men
,
brother
Toby
,
do
n't
write
dialogues
upon
long
noses
for
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
study
the
mystick
and
the
allegorick
sense
 
here
<EOS>
is
some
room

turn
a
man
's
self
in

<EOS>
My
father
read
on

<EOS>
Now
I
find
it
needful
to
inform
your
reverences
and
worships
,
that
besides
the
many
nautical
uses
of
long
noses
enumerated
by
Erasmus
,
the
dialogist
affirmeth
that
a
long
nose
is
not
without
its
domestic
conveniences
also
;
for
that
in
a
case
of
distress
 
and
for
want
of
a
pair
of
bellows
,
it
will
do
excellently
well

Nature
had
been
prodigal
in
her
gifts
to
my
father
beyond
measure
,
and
had
sown
the
seeds
of
verbal
criticism
as
deep
within
him
,
as
she
had
done
the
seeds
of
all
other
knowledge
 
so
that
he
had
got
out
his
penknife
,
and
was
trying
experiments
upon
the
sentence
,
to
see
if
he
could
not
scratch
some
better
sense
into
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
got
within
a
single
letter
,
brother
Toby
,
cried
my
father
,
of
Erasmus
his
mystic
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
near
enough
,
brother
,
replied
my
uncle
,
in
all
conscience
.
 
<EOS>
Pshaw
!
<EOS>
cried
my
father
,
scratching
on
 
<EOS>
I
might
as
well
be
seven
miles
off
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
done
it
 
<EOS>
said
my
father
,
snapping
his
fingers
 
<EOS>
See
,
my
dear
brother
Toby
,
how
I
have
mended
the
sense
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
have
marr'd
a
word
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
put
on
his
spectacles
 
bit
his
lip
 
and
tore
out
the
leaf
in
a
passion
.
    
<EOS>
O
Slawkenbergius
!
<EOS>
thou
faithful
analyzer
of
my
Disgrazias
 
thou
sad
foreteller
of
so
many
of
the
whips
and
short
turns
which
on
one
stage
or
other
of
my
life
have
come
slap
upon
me
from
the
shortness
of
my
nose
,
and
no
other
cause
,
<EOS>
that
I
am
conscious
of
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
Slawkenbergius
!
<EOS>
what
secret
impulse
was
it
?
<EOS>
what
intonation
of
voice

<EOS>
whence
came
it

<EOS>
how
did
it
sound
in

<EOS>
art
thou
<EOS>
sure
thou
<EOS>
heard'st
it

<EOS>
which
first
cried
out

thee
 
go
 
go

Slawkenbergius

<EOS>
dedicate
the
labours

thy

<EOS>

thy

<EOS>
call
forth
<EOS>
all
the

macerate
thyself
in

,
and
write
a
grand
Folio
for

,
upon
the
subject
of
their
noses
.
  
<EOS>
How
the
communication
was
conveyed
into
Slawkenbergius
's
sensorium
 
so
that
Slawkenbergius
should
know
whose
finger
touch'd
<EOS>
the
key
 
and
<EOS>
whose
hand
it
was
that
blew
the
bellows
 
as
Hafen
Slawkenbergius
has
been
dead
and
laid
in
his
grave
above
fourscore
and
ten
years
 
we
can
only
raise
conjectures
.
  
<EOS>
Slawkenbergius
was
play'd
upon
,
for
aught
I
know
,
like
one
of
Whitefield
's
disciples
 
that
is
,
with
such
a
distinct
intelligence
,
Sir
,
of
which
of
the
two
masters
it
was
that
had
been
practising
upon
his
instrument
 
as
to
make
all
reasoning
upon
it
needless
.
    
<EOS>
For
in
the
account
which
Hafen
Slawkenbergius
gives
the
world
of
his
motives
and
occasions
for
writing
,
and
spending
so
many
years
of
his
life
upon
this
one
work
 
towards
the
end
of
his
prolegomena
,
which
by
-
the
-
bye
should
have
come
first
 
but
the
bookbinder
has
most
injudiciously
placed
it
betwixt
the
analytical
contents
of
the
book
,
and
the
book
itself
 
he
informs
his
reader
,
that
ever
since
he
had
arrived
at
the
age
of
discernment
,
and
was
able
to
sit
down
cooly
,
and
consider
within
himself
the
true
state
and
condition
of
man
,
and
distinguish
the
main
end
and
design
of
his
being
;
 
or
 
to
shorten
my
translation
,
for
Slawkenbergius
's
book
is
in
Latin
,
and
not
a
little
prolix
in
this
passage
 
ever
since
I
understood
,
quoth
Slawkenbergius
,
any
thing
 
or
rather
what
was
what
 
and
could
perceive
that
the
point
of
long
noses
had
been
too
loosely
handled
by
all
who
had
gone
before
;
 
have
I
Slawkenbergius
,
felt
a
strong
impulse
,
with
a
mighty
and
unresistible
call
within
me
,
to
gird
up
myself
to
this
undertaking
.
  
<EOS>
And
to
do
justice
to
Slawkenbergius
,
he
has
entered
the
list
with
a
stronger
lance
,
and
taken
a
much
larger
career
in
it
than
any
one
man
who
had
ever
entered
it
before
him
 
and
indeed
,
in
many
respects
,
deserves
to
be
en
-
nich'd
as
a
prototype
for
all
writers
,
of
voluminous
works
at
least
,
to
model
their
books
by
 
for
he
has
taken
in
<EOS>
,
Sir
,
the
whole
subject
  
examined
every
part
of
it
dialectically
 
then
brought
it
into
full
day
;
dilucidating
it
with
all
the
light
which
either
the
collision
of
his
own
natural
parts
could
strike
 
or
the
profoundest
knowledge
of
the
sciences
had
impowered
him
to
cast
upon
it
 
collating
,
collecting
,
and
compiling
  
begging
,
borrowing
,
and
stealing
,
as
he
went
along
,
all
that
had
been
wrote
or
wrangled
thereupon
in
the
schools
and
porticos
of
the
learned
:
 
so
that
Slawkenbergius
his
book
may
properly
be
considered
,
not
only
as
a
model
  
but
as
a
thorough
-
stitched
Digest
and
regular
institute
of
noses
,
comprehending
in
it
all
that
is
or
can
be
needful
to
be
known
about
them
.
  
<EOS>
For
this
cause
<EOS>
it
is
that
I
forbear
to
speak
of
so
many
(
otherwise
)
valuable
books
and
treatises
of
my
father
's
collecting
,
wrote
either
,
plump
upon
noses
 
or
collaterally
touching
them
;
 
such
for
instance
as
Prignitz
,
now
lying
upon
the
table
before
me
,
who
with
infinite
learning
,
and
from
the
most
candid
and
scholar
-
like
examination
of
above
four
thousand
different
skulls
,
in
upwards
of
twenty
charnel
-
houses
in
Silesia
,
which
he
had
rummaged
 
has
informed
us
,
that
the
mensuration
and
configuration
of
the
osseous
or
bony
parts
of
human
noses
,
in
any
given
tract
of
country
,
except
Crim
Tartary
,
where
they
are
all
crush'd
down
by
the
thumb
,
so
that
no
judgment
can
be
formed
upon
them
 
are
much
nearer
alike
,
than
the
world
imagines
;
 
<EOS>
the
difference
amongst
them
being
,
he
says
,
a
mere
trifle
,
not
worth
taking
notice
of
;
 
but
that
the
size
and
jollity
of
every
individual
nose
,
and
by
which
one
nose
ranks
above
another
,
and
bears
a
higher
price
,
is
owing
to
the
cartilaginous
and
muscular
parts
of
it
,
into
whose
ducts
and
sinuses
the
blood
and
animal
spirits
being
impell'd
and
driven
by
the
warmth
and
force
of
the
imagination
,
which
is
but
a
step
from
it
(
bating
the
case
of
idiots
,
whom
Prignitz
,
who
had
lived
many
years
in
Turky
,
supposes
under
the
more
immediate
tutelage
of
Heaven
)
 
<EOS>
it
so
happens
,
and
ever
must
,
says
Prignitz
,
that
the
excellency
of
the
nose
is
in
a
direct
arithmetical
proportion
to
the
excellency
of
the
wearer
's
fancy
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
for
the
same
reason
,
that
is
,
because
'
tis
all
comprehended
in
Slawkenbergius
,
that
I
say
nothing
likewise
of
Scroderus
(
Andrea
)
who
,
all
the
world
knows
,
set
himself
to
oppugn
Prignitz
with
great
violence
  
proving
it
in
his
own
way
,
first
logically
,
and
then
by
a
series
of
stubborn
facts
,
"
That
so
far
was
Prignitz
from
the
truth
,
in
affirming
that
the
fancy
begat
the
nose
,
that
on
the
contrary
 
the
nose
begat
the
fancy
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
learned
suspected
Scroderus
of
an
indecent
sophism
in
this
 
and
Prignitz
cried
out
aloud
in
the
dispute
,
that
Scroderus
had
shifted
the
idea
upon
him
 
but
Scroderus
went
on
,
maintaining
his
thesis
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
was
just
balancing
within
himself
,
which
of
the
two
sides
he
should
take
in
this
affair
;
when
Ambrose
Paraeus
decided
it
in
a
moment
,
and
by
overthrowing
the
systems
,
both
of
Prignitz
and
Scroderus
,
drove
my
father
out
of
both
sides
of
the
controversy
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
Be
witness
    
<EOS>
I
do
n't
acquaint
the
learned
reader
 
in
saying
it
<EOS>
,
I
mention
it
only
to
shew
the
learned
,
I
know
the
fact
myself
    
That
this
Ambrose
Paraeus
was
chief
surgeon
and
nose
-
mender
to
Francis
the
ninth
of
France
,
and
in
high
credit
with
him
and
the
two
preceding
,
or
succeeding
kings
(
I
know
not
which
)
 
and
that
,
except
in
the
slip
he
made
in
his
story
of
Taliacotius
's
noses
,
and
his
manner
of
setting
them
on
 
he
was
esteemed
by
the
whole
college
of
physicians
at
that
time
,
as
more
knowing
in
matters
of
noses
,
than
any
one
who
had
ever
taken
them
in
hand
.
  
<EOS>
Now
Ambrose
Paraeus
convinced
my
father
,
that
the
true
and
efficient
cause
of
what
had
engaged
so
much
the
attention
of
the
world
,
and
upon
which
Prignitz
and
Scroderus
had
wasted
so
much
learning
and
fine
parts
 
was
neither
this
nor
that
 
but
that
the
length
and
goodness
of
the
nose
was
owing
simply
to
the
softness
and
flaccidity
in
the
nurse
's
breast
 
as
the
flatness
and
shortness
of
puisne
noses
was
to
the
firmness
and
elastic
repulsion
of
the
same
organ
of
nutrition
in
the
hale
and
lively
 
<EOS>
which
,
tho
'
happy
for
the
woman
,
was
the
undoing
of
the
child
,
inasmuch
as
his
nose
was
so
snubb'd
,
so
rebuff'd
,
so
rebated
,
and
so
refrigerated
thereby
,
as
never
to
arrive
ad
mensuram
suam
legitimam
;
 
but
<EOS>
that
in
case
of
the
flaccidity
and
softness
of
the
nurse
or
mother
's
breast
 
by
sinking
into
it
,
quoth
Paraeus
,
as
into
so
much
butter
,
the
nose
was
comforted
,
nourish'd
,
plump'd
up
,
refresh'd
,
refocillated
,
and
set
a
growing
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
but
two
things
to
observe
of
Paraeus
;
first
,
That
he
proves
and
explains
all
this
with
the
utmost
chastity
and
decorum
of
expression
:
 
for
which
may
his
soul
for
ever
rest
in
peace
!
  
<EOS>
And
,
secondly
,
that
besides
the
systems
of
Prignitz
and
Scroderus
,
which
Ambrose
Paraeus
<EOS>
his
hypothesis
effectually
overthrew
 
<EOS>
it
overthrew
at
the
same
time
the
system
of
peace
and
harmony
of
our
family
;
and
for
three
days
together
,
not
only
embroiled
matters
between
my
father
and
my
mother
,
but
turn'd
<EOS>
likewise
the
whole
house
and
every
thing
in
it
,
except
my
uncle
Toby
,
quite
upside
down
.
  
<EOS>
Such
a
ridiculous
tale
of
a
dispute
between
a
man
and
his
wife
,
never
surely
in
any
age
or
country
got
vent
through
the
key
-
hole
of
a
street-
door
.
  
<EOS>
My
mother

you
must
know
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
fifty
things
more
necessary
to
let
you
know
first
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
hundred
difficulties
which
I
have
promised
to
clear
up
,
and
a
thousand
distresses
and
domestick
misadventures
crowding
in
upon
me
thick
and
threefold
,
one
upon
the
neck
of
another

<EOS>
A

upon
being
tried

the

Slop

myself

poor

there

exclamations
 
I

my

across

my

old
fringed

sitting

Of

seen
in
 
this
certainly
is
the
greatest
,
for
I
have
Hafen
Slawkenbergius
's
folio
,
Sir
,
to
finish
 
a
dialogue
between
my
father
and
my
uncle
Toby
,
upon
the
solution
of
Prignitz
,
Scroderus
,
Ambrose
Paraeus
,
Panocrates
,
and
Grangousier
to
relate
 
a
tale
out
of
Slawkenbergius
to
translate
,
and
all
this
in
five
minutes
less
than
no
time
at
all
;
 
such
a
head
!
 
<EOS>
would
to
Heaven
<EOS>
my
enemies
only
saw
the
inside
of
it
!
    
<EOS>
There
was
not
any
one
scene
more
entertaining
in
our
family
 
and
to
do
it
justice
in
this
point
;
 
and
I
here
put
off
my
cap
and
lay
it
upon
the
table
close
beside
my
ink
-
horn
,
on
purpose
to
make
my
declaration
to
the
world
concerning
this
one
article
the
more
solemn
 
that
I
believe
in
my
soul
(
unless
my
love
and
partiality
to
my
understanding
blinds
me
)
<EOS>
the
hand
of
the
supreme
Maker
and
first
Designer
of
all
things
never
made
or
put
a
family
together
(
in
that
period
at
least
of
it
which
I
have
sat
down
to
write
the
story
of
)
 
where
the
characters
of
it
were
cast
or
contrasted
with
so
dramatick
a
felicity
as
ours
was
,
for
this
end
;
or
in
which
the
capacities
of
affording
such
exquisite
scenes
,
and
the
powers
of
shifting
them
perpetually
from
morning
to
night
,
were
lodged
and
intrusted
with
so
unlimited
a
confidence
,
as
in
the
Shandy
Family
.
  
<EOS>
Not
any
one
of
these
was
more
diverting
,
I
say
,
in
this
whimsical
theatre
of
ours
 
than
what
frequently
arose
out
of
this
self
-
same
chapter
of
long
noses
 
especially
when
my
father
's
imagination
was
heated
with
the
enquiry
,
and
nothing
would
serve
him
but
to
heat
my
uncle
Toby
's
too
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
would
give
my
father
all
possible
fair
play
in
this
attempt
;
and
with
infinite
patience
would
sit
smoking
his
pipe
for
whole
hours
together
,
whilst
my
father
was
practising
upon
his
head
,
and
trying
every
accessible
avenue
to
drive
Prignitz
and
Scroderus
's
solutions
into
it
.
  
<EOS>
Whether
they
were
above
my
uncle
Toby
's
reason
 
or
contrary
to
it
 
or
that
his
brain
was
like
damp
timber
,
and
no
spark
could
possibly
take
hold
 
or
that
it
was
so
full
of
saps
,
mines
,
blinds
,
curtins
,
and
such
military
disqualifications
to
his
seeing
clearly
into
Prignitz
and
Scroderus
's
doctrines
 
<EOS>
I
say
not
 
let
schoolmen
 
scullions
,
anatomists
,
and
engineers
,
fight
for
it
among
themselves
    
<EOS>
@@@Twas
some
misfortune
<EOS>
,
I
make
no
doubt
,
in
this
affair
,
that
my
father
had
every
word
of
it
to
translate
for
the
benefit
of
my
uncle
Toby
,
and
render
out
of
Slawkenbergius
's
Latin
,
of
which
,
as
he
was
no
great
master
,
his
translation
was
not
always
of
the
purest
 
and
generally
least
so
where
'
twas
most
wanted
.
 
<EOS>
This
<EOS>
naturally
open'd
a
door
to
a
second
misfortune
;
  
that
in
the
warmer
paroxysms
of
his
zeal
to
open
my
uncle
Toby
's
eyes
 
my
father
's
ideas
ran
on
as
much
faster
than
the
translation
,
as
the
translation
outmoved
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
's
 
neither
the
one
or
the
other
added
much
to
the
perspicuity
of
my
father
's
lecture
.
    
<EOS>
The
gift
of
ratiocination
and
making
syllogisms
 
<EOS>
I
mean
in
man
 
for
in
superior
classes
of
being
,
such
as
angels
and
spirits
 
<EOS>
'
tis
all
done
,
may
it
please
your
worships
,
as
they
tell
me
,
by
Intuition
;
 
and
beings
inferior
,
as
your
worships
all
know
 
syllogize
by
their
noses
:
 
though
there
is
an
island
swimming
in
the
sea
(
though
not
altogether
at
its
ease
)
<EOS>
whose
inhabitants
,
if
my
intelligence
deceives
me
not
,
are
so
wonderfully
gifted
,
as
to
syllogize
after
the
same
fashion
,
and
oft
-
times
to
make
very
well
out
too
:
 
<EOS>
but
that
's
neither
here
nor
there
    
<EOS>
The
gift
of
doing
it
as
it
should
be
,
amongst
us
,
or
 
the
great
and
principal
act
of
ratiocination
in
man
,
as
logicians
tell
us
,
is
the
finding
out
the
agreement
or
disagreement
of
two
ideas
one
with
another
,
by
the
intervention
of
a
third
(
called
the
medius
terminus
)
;
just
as
a
man
,
as
Locke
well
observes
,
by
a
yard
,
finds
two
mens
nine
-
pin
-
alleys
to
be
of
the
same
length
,
which
could
not
be
brought
together
,
to
measure
their
equality
,
by
juxta
-
position
.
  
<EOS>
Had
the
same
great
reasoner
looked
on
,
as
my
father
illustrated
his
systems
of
noses
,
and
observed
my
uncle
Toby
's
deportment
 
<EOS>
what
great
attention
he
gave
to
every
word
 
and
as
oft
as
he
took
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
,
<EOS>
with
what
wonderful
seriousness
he
contemplated
the
length
of
it
 
surveying
it
transversely
as
he
held
it
betwixt
his
finger
and
his
thumb
 
<EOS>
then
fore-
<EOS>
right
 
then
this
way
,
and
then
that
,
in
all
its
possible
directions
and
fore
-
shortenings
 
he
would
have
concluded
my
uncle
Toby
had
got
hold
of
the
medius
terminus
,
and
was
syllogizing
and
measuring
with
it
the
truth
of
each
hypothesis
of
long
noses
,
in
order
,
as
my
father
laid
them
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
by
-
the
-
bye
,
was
more
than
my
father
wanted
 
<EOS>
his
aim
in
all
the
pains
he
was
at
in
these
philosophick
lectures
 
was
to
enable
my
uncle
Toby
not
to
discuss
 
but
comprehend
 
to
hold
the
grains
and
scruples
of
learning
  
not
to
weigh
them
.
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
,
as
you
will
read
in
the
next
chapter
,
did
neither
the
one
or
the
other
.
    
<EOS>
@@@Tis
a
pity
,
cried
my
father
one
winter
's
night
,
after
a
three
hours
painful
translation
of
Slawkenbergius
 
'
tis
a
pity
,
cried
my
father
,
putting
my
mother
's
threadpaper
into
the
book
for
a
mark
,
as
he
spoke
 
that
truth
,
brother
Toby
,
should
shut
herself
up
in
such
impregnable
fastnesses
,
and
be
so
obstinate
as
not
to
surrender
herself
sometimes
up
upon
the
closest
siege
.
    
<EOS>
Now
it
happened
then
,
as
indeed
it
had
often
done
before
,
that
my
uncle
Toby
's
fancy
,
during
the
time
of
my
father
's
explanation
of
Prignitz
to
him
 
having
nothing
to
stay
it
there
,
had
taken
a
short
flight
to
the
bowling
-
green
;
 
his
body
might
as
well
have
taken
a
turn
there
too
 
so
that
with
all
the
semblance
of
a
deep
school
-
man
intent
upon
the
medius
terminus
 
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
was
in
fact
as
ignorant
of
the
whole
lecture
,
and
all
its
pros
and
cons
,
as
if
my
father
had
been
translating
Hafen
Slawkenbergius
from
the
Latin
tongue
into
the
Cherokee
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
word
siege
,
like
a
talismanic
power
,
in
my
father
's
metaphor
,
wafting
back
my
uncle
Toby
's
fancy
,
quick
as
a
note
could
follow
the
touch
 
<EOS>
he
open'd
<EOS>
his
ears
 
and
my
father
observing
that
he
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
,
and
shuffled
his
chair
nearer
the
table
,
as
with
a
desire
to
profit
 
my
father
with
great
pleasure
began
his
sentence
again
 
changing
only
the
plan
,
and
dropping
the
metaphor
of
the
siege
of
it
,
to
keep
clear
of
some
dangers
my
father
apprehended
from
it
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
<EOS>
a
pity
,
said
my
father
,
that
truth
can
only
be
on
one
side
,
brother
Toby
 
<EOS>
considering
what
ingenuity
these
learned
men
have
all
shewn
in
their
solutions
of
noses
.
 
<EOS>
Can
noses
be
dissolved
?
<EOS>
replied
my
uncle
Toby
.
    
<EOS>
My
father
thrust
back
his
chair
 
rose
up
 
put
on
his
hat
 
took
four
long
strides
to
the
door
 
<EOS>
jerked
it
open
 
<EOS>
thrust
his

half
way
out
 
<EOS>
shut

no

<EOS>
pluck'd
<EOS>
my

out

bran
  
confounded

;
 
but
mark
!
 
<EOS>
the
oath
of
confusion
was
levell'd
<EOS>
at
my
uncle
Toby
's
brain
 
which
was
e'en
confused
enough
already
 
<EOS>
the
curse
came
charged
only
with
the
bran
 
<EOS>
the
bran

no
more

<EOS>
@@@Twas
<EOS>
well
my
father
's
passions
lasted
not
long
;
for
so
long
as
they
did
last
,
they
led
him
a
busy
life
on't
;
and
it
is
one
of
the
most
unaccountable
problems
that
ever
I
met
with
in
my
observations
of
human
nature
,
that
nothing
should
prove
my
father
's
mettle
so
much
,
or
make
his
passions
go
off
so
like
gun
-
powder
,
as
the
unexpected
strokes
his
science
met
with
from
the
quaint
simplicity
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
questions
.
 
<EOS>
Had
ten
dozen
of
hornets
stung
him
behind
in
so
many
different
places
all
at
one
time
 
<EOS>
he
could
not
have
exerted
more
mechanical
functions
in
fewer
seconds
 
or
started
half
so
much
,
as
with
one
single
quaere
of
three
words
unseasonably
popping
in
full
upon
him
in
his
hobby
-
horsical
career
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Twas
all
one
to
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
 
<EOS>
he
smoked
his
pipe
on
with
unvaried
composure
 
<EOS>
his
heart
never
intended
offence
to
his
brother
 
and
as
his
head
could
seldom
find
out
where
the
sting
of
it
lay
 
he
always
gave
my
father
the
credit
of
cooling
by
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
five
minutes
and
thirty
-
five
seconds
about
it
in
the
present
case
.
  
<EOS>
By
all
that
's
good
!
<EOS>
said
my
father
,
swearing
,
as
he
came
to
himself
,
and
taking
the
oath
out
of
Ernulphus
's
digest
of
curses
 
<EOS>
(
though
to
do
my
father
justice
it
was
a
fault
(
as
he
told
Dr.
Slop
in
the
affair
of
Ernulphus
)
which
he
as
seldom
committed
as
any
man
upon
earth
)
 
<EOS>
By
all
that
's
good
and
great
!
<EOS>
brother
Toby
,
said
my
father
,
if
it
was
not
for
the
aids
of
philosophy
,
which
befriend
one
so
much
as
they
do
 
you
would
put
a
man
beside
all
temper
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
by
the
solutions
of
noses
,
of
which
I
was
telling
you
,
I
meant
,
as
you
might
have
known
,
had
you
favoured
me
with
one
grain
of
attention
,
the
various
accounts
which
learned
men
of
different
kinds
of
knowledge
have
given
the
world
of
the
causes
of
short
and
long
noses
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
cause
but
one
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
why
one
man
's
nose
is
longer
than
another
's
,
but
because
that
God
pleases
to
have
it
so
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
Grangousier
's
solution
,
said
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
he
,
continued
my
uncle
Toby
,
looking
up
,
and
not
regarding
my
father
's
interruption
,
who
makes
us
all
,
and
frames
and
puts
us
together
in
such
forms
and
proportions
,
and
for
such
ends
,
as
is
agreeable
to
his
infinite
wisdom
,
.
  
<EOS>
'
Tis
a
pious
account
,
cried
my
father
,
but
not
philosophical
 
<EOS>
there
is
more
religion
in
it
than
sound
science
.
 
<EOS>
'
Twas
no
inconsistent
part
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
character
 
that
he
feared
God
,
and
reverenced
religion
.
 
<EOS>
So
the
moment
my
father
finished
his
remark
 
my
uncle
Toby
fell
a
whistling
Lillabullero
with
more
zeal
(
though
more
out
of
tune
)
than
usual
.
    
<EOS>
What
is
become
of
my
wife
's
thread
-
paper
?
    
<EOS>
No
matter
 
as
an
appendage
to
seamstressy
,
the
thread
-
paper
might
be
of
some
consequence
to
my
mother
 
of
none
to
my
father
,
as
a
mark
in
Slawkenbergius
.
 
<EOS>
Slawkenbergius
in
every
page
of
him
was
a
rich
treasure
of
inexhaustible
knowledge
to
my
father
 
he
could
not
open
him
amiss
;
and
he
would
often
say
in
closing
the
book
,
that
if
all
the
arts
and
sciences
in
the
world
,
with
the
books
which
treated
of
them
,
were
lost
 
should
the
wisdom
and
policies
of
governments
,
he
would
say
,
through
disuse
,
ever
happen
to
be
forgot
,
and
all
that
statesmen
had
wrote
or
caused
to
be
written
,
upon
the
strong
or
the
weak
sides
of
courts
and
kingdoms
,
should
they
be
forgot
also
 
and
<EOS>
Slawkenbergius
only
left
 
there
would
be
enough
in
him
in
all
conscience
,
he
would
say
,
to
set
the
world
a
-
going
again
.
 
<EOS>
A
treasure
therefore
was
he
indeed
!
<EOS>
an
institute
of
all
that
was
necessary
to
be
known
of
noses
,
and
every
thing
else
 
at
matin
,
noon
,
and
vespers
was
Hafen
Slawkenbergius
his
recreation
and
delight
:
 
'
twas
for
ever
in
his
hands
 
you
would
have
sworn
,
Sir
,
it
had
been
a
canon
's
prayer
-
book
 
<EOS>
so
worn
,
so
glazed
,
so
contrited
and
attrited
was
it
with
fingers
and
with
thumbs
in
all
its
parts
,
from
one
end
even
unto
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
not
such
a
bigot
to
Slawkenbergius
as
my
father
;
 
there
is
a
fund
in
him
,
no
doubt
:
 
<EOS>
but
in
my
opinion
,
the
best
,
I
do
n't
say
the
most
profitable
,
but
the
most
amusing
part
of
Hafen
Slawkenbergius
,
is
his
tales
 
and
,
considering
he
was
a
German
,
many
of
them
told
not
without
fancy
:
 
<EOS>
these
take
up
his
second
book
,
containing
nearly
one
half
of
his
folio
,
and
are
comprehended
in
ten
decads
,
each
decad
containing
ten
tales
 
<EOS>
Philosophy
is
not
built
upon
tales
;
and
therefore
'
twas
certainly
wrong
in
Slawkenbergius
to
send
them
into
the
world
by
that
name
!
 
<EOS>
there
are
a
few
of
them
in
his

ninth

tenth
decads
,
which
I
own
seem
rather
playful
and
sportive
,
than
speculative
 
<EOS>
but
in
general
they
are
to
be
looked
upon
by
the
learned
as
a
detail
of
so
many
independent
facts
,
all
of
them
turning
round
somehow
or
other
upon
the
main
hinges
of
his
subject
,
and
added
to
his
work
as
so
many
illustrations
upon
the
doctrines
of
noses
.

you
the

it

not

the

a

pages

his
original
;
I
will
make
no
reflection
upon
it

that
his
story

telling
Latin
is
much
more
concise

his
philosophic

,
I
think

has
more
of

Slawkenbergius
's
Tale
  
<EOS>
It
was
one
cool
refreshing
evening
,
at
the
close
of
a
very
sultry
day
,
in
the
latter
end
of
the
month
of
August
,
when
a
stranger
,
mounted
upon
a
dark
mule
,
with
a
small
cloak
-
bag
behind
him
,
containing
a
few
shirts
,
a
pair
of
shoes
,
and
a
crimson
-
sattin
pair
of
breeches
,
entered
the
town
of
Strasburg
.
  
<EOS>
He
told
the
centinel
,
who
questioned
him
as
he
entered
the
gates
,
that
he
had
been
at
the
Promontory
of
Noses
 
was
going
on
to
Frankfort
 
and
should
be
back
again
at
Strasburg
that
day
month
,
in
his
way
to
the
borders
of
Crim
Tartary
.
  
<EOS>
The
centinel
looked
up
into
the
stranger
's
face
 
he
never
saw
such
a
Nose
in
his
life
!
    
<EOS>
I
have
made
a
very
good
venture
of
it
,
quoth
<EOS>
the
stranger
 
<EOS>
so
slipping
his
wrist
out
of
the
loop
of
a
black
ribbon
,
to
which
a
short
scymetar
was
hung
,
he
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
,
and
with
great
courtesy
touching
the
fore
part
of
his
cap
with
his
left
hand
,
as
he
extended
his
right
 
<EOS>
he
put
a
florin
into
the
centinel
's
hand
,
and
passed
on
.
  
<EOS>
It
grieves
,
me
,
said
the
centinel
,
speaking
to
a
little
dwarfish
bandy-
<EOS>
legg'd
drummer
,
that
so
courteous
a
soul
should
have
lost
his
scabbard
 
he
can
not
travel
without
one
to
his
scymetar
,
and
will
not
be
able
to
get
a
scabbard
to
fit
it
in
all
Strasburg
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
had
one
,
replied
the
stranger
,
looking
back
to
the
centinel
,
and
putting
his
hand
up
to
his
cap
as
he
spoke
 
<EOS>
I
carry
it
,
continued
he
,
thus
 
holding
up
his
naked
scymetar
,
his
mule
moving
on
slowly
all
the
time
 
on
purpose
to
defend
my
nose
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
well
worth
it
,
gentle
stranger
,
replied
the
centinel
.
    
<EOS>
'
<EOS>
Tis
not
worth
a
single
stiver
<EOS>
,
said
the
bandy
-
legg'd
drummer
 
'
tis
a
nose
of
parchment
.
  
<EOS>
As
I
am
a
true
catholic
 
except
that
it
is
six
times
as
big
 
'
tis
a
nose
,
said
the
centinel
,
like
my
own
.
    
<EOS>
I
heard
it
crackle
,
said
the
drummer
.
  
<EOS>
By
dunder
,
said
the
centinel
<EOS>
,
I
saw
it
bleed
.
  
<EOS>
What
a
pity
,
cried
the
bandy
-
legg'd
drummer
,
we
did
not
both
touch
it
!
  
<EOS>
At
the
very
time
that
this
dispute
was
maintaining
by
the
centinel
and
the
drummer
 
was
the
same
point
debating
betwixt
a
trumpeter
and
a
trumpeter
's
wife
,
who
were
just
then
coming
up
,
and
had
stopped
to
see
the
stranger
pass
by
.
  
<EOS>
Benedicity
!
 
<EOS>
What
a
nose
!
'
<EOS>
tis
as
long
,
said
the
trumpeter
's
wife
,
as
a
trumpet
.
  
<EOS>
And
of
the
same
metal
said
the
trumpeter
,
as
you
hear
by
its
sneezing
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
as
soft
as
a
flute
,
said
she
.
    
<EOS>
'
Tis
brass
,
said
the
trumpeter
.
    
<EOS>
'
Tis
a
pudding
's
end
,
said
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
thee
again
,
said
the
trumpeter
,
'
tis
a
brazen
nose
<EOS>
,
  
I
'll
know
the
bottom
of
it
,
said
the
trumpeter
's
wife
,
for
I
will
touch
it
with
my
finger
before
I
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
The
stranger
's
mule
moved
on
at
so
slow
a
rate
,
that
he
heard
every
word
of
the
dispute
,
not
only
betwixt
the
centinel
and
the
drummer
,
but
betwixt
the
trumpeter
and
trumpeter
's
wife
.
  
<EOS>
No
!
said
he
,
dropping
his
reins
upon
his
mule
's
neck
,
and
laying
both
his
hands
upon
his
breast
,
the
one
over
the
other
in
a
saint
-
like
position
<EOS>
(
his
mule
going
on
easily
all
the
time
)
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
looking
up
 
I
am
not
such
a
debtor
to
the
world
 
slandered
and
disappointed
as
I
have
been
 
as
to
give
it
that
conviction
 
<EOS>
no
!
said
he
,
my
nose
shall
never
be
touched
whilst
<EOS>
Heaven
gives
me
strength
 
<EOS>
To
do
what
?
<EOS>
said
a
burgomaster
's
wife
.
  
<EOS>
The
stranger
took
no
notice
of
the
burgomaster
's
wife
 
he
was
making
a
vow
to
Saint
Nicolas
;
which
done
,
having
uncrossed
his
arms
with
the
same
solemnity
with
which
he
crossed
them
,
he
took
up
the
reins
of
his
bridle
with
his
left
-
hand
,
and
putting
his
right
hand
into
his
bosom
,
with
the
scymetar
hanging
loosely
to
the
wrist
of
it
,
he
rode
on
,
as
slowly
as
one
foot
of
the
mule
could
follow
another
,
thro
'
the
principal
streets
of
Strasburg
,
till
chance
brought
him
to
the
great
inn
in
the
market
-
place
over
-
against
the
church
.
  
<EOS>
The
moment
the
stranger
alighted
,
he
ordered
his
mule
to
be
led
into
the
stable
,
and
his
cloak
-
bag
to
be
brought
in
;
then
opening
,
and
taking
out
of
it
his
crimson
-
sattin
breeches
,
with
a
silver
-
fringed
 
(
appendage
to
them
,
which
I
dare
not
translate
)
 
<EOS>
he
put
his
breeches
,
with
his
fringed
cod-
piece
on
,
and
forth
-
with
,
with
his
short
scymetar
in
his
hand
,
walked
out
to
the
grand
parade
.
  
<EOS>
The
stranger
had
just
taken
three
turns
upon
the
parade
,
when
he
perceived
the
trumpeter
's
wife
at
the
opposite
side
of
it
 
<EOS>
so
turning
short
,
in
pain
lest
his
nose
should
be
attempted
,
he
instantly
went
back
to
his
inn
  
<EOS>
undressed
himself
,
packed
up
his
crimson
-
sattin
breeches
,
&
c.
in
his
cloak-
bag
,
and
called
for
his
mule
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
going
forwards
,
said
the
stranger
,
for
Frankfort
 
and
shall
be
back
at
Strasburg
this
day
month
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
,
continued
the
stranger
,
stroking
down
the
face
of
his
mule
with
his
left
hand
as
he
was
going
to
mount
it
,
that
you
have
been
kind
to
this
faithful
slave
of
mine
 
<EOS>
it
has
carried
me
and
my
cloak
-
bag
,
continued
he
,
tapping
the
mule
's
back
,
above
six
hundred
leagues
.
    
<EOS>
'
Tis
a
long
journey
,
Sir

replied
the
master
of
the
inn
 
unless
a
man
has
great
business
.
 
<EOS>
Tut
!
<EOS>
tut

<EOS>
said
the
stranger
,
I
have
been
at
the
promontory
of
Noses
;
and
have
got
me
one
of
the
goodliest
,
thank
Heaven
,
that
ever
fell
to
a

man
's
lot

<EOS>
Whilst
the
stranger
was
giving
this
odd
account
of
himself
,
<EOS>
the
master
of
the
inn
and
his
wife
kept
both
their
eyes
fixed
full
upon
the
stranger
's
nose
 
By

Radagunda

said
the
inn
-
keeper

to
herself

there

more
of

of

largest

<EOS>

said
she

The

had
not

half
a

on
his

towards
Frankfort
before
all
the

Strasburg
was
in

uproar
about
his

were
just
ringing
to
call
the

to
their

shut
up

in
prayer
:

rode

had
that
night
been

slitting

should

either
time

search
for
it

<EOS>
Let
it
suffice
to
say
,
that
the
riot
and
disorder
it
occasioned
in
the
Strasburgers
fantasies
was
so
general
  
<EOS>
such
an
overpowering
mastership
had
it
got

all

faculties

minds
 
<EOS>
so
many
strange
things
,
with
equal
confidence
on
all
sides

with
equal
eloquence
in
all
places

were
spoken

sworn

concerning
it

would
not
return
to
Strasburg

and
secondly
,
whether
his

was
true

false

that
the

paragons

sending
at

worth
remarking

that
as

finished
the

private
lecture

had
begun
to
read
in
public
,
which
she
did
upon
a
stool
in
the
middle

great
parade

incommoded

gaining

auditory

they
reasoned
    
Not
one
profession
had
thrown
more
light
upon
this
subject
<EOS>
than
the
Faculty
 
had
not
all
their
disputes
about
it
run
into
the
affair
of
Wens
and
oedematous
swellings
,
they
could
not
keep
clear
of
them
for
their
bloods
and
souls
 
<EOS>
the
stranger
's
nose
had
nothing
to
do
either
with
wens
or
oedematous
swellings
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
demonstrated
however
very
satisfactorily
,
that
such
a
ponderous
mass
of
heterogenous
matter
could
not
be
congested
and
conglomerated
to
the
nose
,
whilst
the
infant
was
in
Utera
,
without
destroying
the
statical
balance
of
the
foetus
,
and
throwing
it
plump
upon
its
head
nine
months
before
the
time
.
      
<EOS>
The
opponents
granted
the
theory
 
they
denied
the
consequences
.
  
<EOS>
And
if
a
suitable
provision
of
veins
,
arteries
,
&
c.
said
they
,
was
not
laid
in
,
for
the
due
nourishment
of
such
a
nose
,
in
the
very
first
stamina
and
rudiments
of
its
formation
,
before
it
came
into
the
world
(
bating
the
case
of
Wens
)
<EOS>
it
could
not
regularly
grow
and
be
sustained
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
all
answered
by
a
dissertation
upon
nutriment
,
and
the
effect
which
nutriment
had
in
extending
the
vessels
,
and
in
the
increase
and
prolongation
of
the
muscular
parts
to
the
greatest
growth
and
expansion
imaginable
 
<EOS>
In
the
triumph
of
which
theory
,
they
went
so
far
as
to
affirm
,
that
there
was
no
cause
in
nature
,
why
a
nose
might
not
grow
to
the
size
of
the
man
himself
.
  
<EOS>
The
respondents
satisfied
the
world
<EOS>
this
event
could
never
happen
to
them
so
long
as
a
man
had
but
one
stomach
and
one
pair
of
lungs
 
<EOS>
For
the
stomach
,
said
they
,
being
the
only
organ
destined
for
the
reception
of
food
,
and
turning
it
into
chyle
 
and
the
lungs
the
only
engine
of
sanguification
 
it
could
possibly
work
off
no
more
,
than
what
the
appetite
brought
it
:
 
or
admitting
the
possibility
of
a
man
's
overloading
his
stomach
,
nature
had
set
bounds
however
to
his
lungs
 
<EOS>
the
engine
was
of
a
determined
size
and
strength
,
and
could
elaborate
but
a
certain
quantity
in
a
given
time
 
that
is
,
it
could
produce
just
as
much
blood
as
was
sufficient
for
one
single
man
,
and
no
more
;
so
that
,
if
there
was
as
much
nose
as
man
 
<EOS>
they
proved
a
mortification
must
necessarily
ensue
;
and
forasmuch
as
there
could
not
be
a
support
for
both
,
that
the
nose
must
either
fall
off
from
the
man
,
or
the
man
inevitably
fall
off
from
his
nose
.
  
<EOS>
Nature
accommodates
herself
to
these
emergencies
,
cried
the
opponents
 
else
what
do
you
say
to
the
case
of
a
whole
stomach
 
a
whole
pair
of
lungs
,
and
<EOS>
but
half
a
man
,
when
both
his
legs
have
been
unfortunately
shot
off
?
  
<EOS>
He
dies
of
a
plethora
,
said
they
 
or
must
spit
blood
,
and
in
a
fortnight
or
three
weeks
go
off
in
a
consumption
.
      
<EOS>
It
happens
otherwise
 
replied
the
opponents
.
    
<EOS>
It
ought
not
,
said
they
.
  
<EOS>
The
more
curious
and
intimate
inquirers
after
nature
and
her
doings
,
though
they
went
hand
in
hand
a
good
way
together
,
yet
they
all
divided
about
the
nose
at
last
,
almost
as
much
as
the
Faculty
itself
  
<EOS>
They
amicably
laid
it
down
,
that
there
was
a
just
and
geometrical
arrangement
and
proportion
of
the
several
parts
of
the
human
frame
to
its
several
destinations
,
offices
,
and
functions
,
which
could
not
be
transgressed
but
within
certain
limits
 
<EOS>
that
nature
,
though
she
sported
  
she
sported
within
a
certain
circle
;
 
and
they
could
not
agree
about
the
diameter
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
logicians
stuck
much
closer
to
the
point
before
them
than
any
of
the
classes
of
the
literati
;
 
they
began
and
ended
with
the
word
Nose
;
and
had
it
not
been
for
a
petitio
principii
,
which
one
of
the
ablest
of
them
ran
his
head
against
in
the
beginning
of
the
combat
,
the
whole
controversy
had
been
settled
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
A
nose
,
argued
the
logician
,
can
not
bleed
without
blood
 
and
not
only
blood
 
but
blood
circulating
in
it
to
supply
the
phaenomenon
with
a
succession
of
drops
 
(
a
stream
being
but
a
quicker
succession
of
drops
,
that
is
included
,
said
he
.
)
 
<EOS>
Now
death
,
continued
the
logician
,
being
nothing
but
the
stagnation
of
the
blood
    
<EOS>
I
deny
the
definition
 
<EOS>
Death
is
the
separation
of
the
soul
from
the
body
,
said
his
antagonist
 
<EOS>
Then
we
do
n't
agree
about
our
weapons
,
said
the
logician
 
<EOS>
Then
there
is
an
end
of
the
dispute
,
replied
the
antagonist
.
  
<EOS>
The
civilians
were
still
more
concise
:
 
what
they
offered
being
more
in
the
nature
of
a
decree
 
than
a
dispute
.
  
<EOS>
Such
a
monstrous
nose
,
said
they
,
had
it
been
a
true
nose
,
could
not
possibly
have
been
suffered
in
civil
society
 
and
if
false
 
to
impose
upon
society
with
such
false
signs
and
tokens
,
was
a
still
greater
violation
of
its
rights
,
and
must
have
had
still
less
mercy
shewn
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
only
objection
to
this
was
,
that
if
it
proved
any
thing
,
it
proved
the
stranger
's
nose
was
neither
true
nor
false
.
  
<EOS>
This
left
room
for
the
controversy
to
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
maintained
by
the
advocates
of
the
ecclesiastic
court
,
that
there
was
nothing
to
inhibit
a
decree
,
since
the
stranger
ex
mero
motu
had
confessed
he
had
been
at
the
Promontory
of
Noses
,
and
had
got
one
of
the
goodliest
,
&
c.
&
c.
 
<EOS>
To
this
it
was
answered
,
it
was
impossible
there
should
be
such
a
place
as
the
Promontory
of
Noses
,
and
the
learned
be
ignorant
where
it
lay
.
 
<EOS>
The
commissary
of
the
bishop
of
Strasburg
undertook
the
advocates
,
explained
this
matter
in
a
treatise
upon
proverbial
phrases
,
shewing
them
,
that
the
Promontory
of
Noses
was
a
mere
allegorick
expression
,
importing
no
more
than
that
nature
had
given
him
a
long
nose
:
 
in
proof
of
which
,
with
great
learning
,
he
cited
the
underwritten
authorities

which
had
decided
the
point
incontestably
,
had
it
not
appeared
that
a
dispute
about
some
franchises
of
dean
and
chapter
-
lands
had
been
determined
by
it
nineteen
years
before
.
  
<EOS>
It
happened
 
I
must
say
unluckily
for
Truth
,
because
they
were
giving
her
a
lift
another
way
in
so
doing
;
that
the
two
universities
of
Strasburg
 
the
Lutheran
,
founded
in
the
year
1538
by
Jacobus
Surmis
,
counsellor
of
the
senate
,
 
and
the
Popish
,
founded
by
Leopold
,
arch
-
duke
of
Austria
,
were
,
during
all
this
time
,
employing
the
whole
depth
of
their
knowledge
(
except
just
what
the
affair
of
the
abbess
of
Quedlingberg
's
placket
-
holes
required
)
 
in
determining
the
point
of
Martin
Luther
's
damnation
.
  
<EOS>
The
Popish
doctors
had
undertaken
to
demonstrate
a
priori
,
that
from
the
necessary
influence
of
the
planets
on
the
twenty
-
second
day
of
October
1483
 
when
the
moon
was
in
the
twelfth
house
,
Jupiter
,
Mars
,
and
Venus
in
the
third
,
the
Sun

Saturn

Mercury

all
got
together
in

that
he
must
in
course

unavoidably
,
be
a
damn'd

that
his

by

be
damn'd

too

(
in
reading
this
my
father
would
always
shake
his
head
)
in
the
ninth
house
,
with
the
Arabians
allotted
to
religion
 
<EOS>
it
appeared
that
Martin
Luther
did
not
care
one
stiver
about
the
matter
 
and
that
from
the
horoscope
directed
to
the
conjunction
of
Mars
  
they
made
it
plain
likewise
he
must
die
cursing
and
blaspheming
 
with
the
blast
of
which
his
soul
(
being
steep'd
in
guilt
)
sailed
before
the
wind
,
in
the
lake
of
hell
-
fire
.
  
<EOS>
The
little
objection
of
the
Lutheran
doctors
to
this
,
was
,
that
it
must
certainly
be
the
soul
of
another
man
,
born
Oct.
22
,
83
.
<EOS>
which
was
forced
to
sail
down
before
the
wind
in
that
manner
 
inasmuch
as
it
appeared
from
the
register
of
Islaben
in
the
county
of
Mansfelt
,
that
Luther
was
not
born
in
the
year
1483
,
but
in
84
;
and
not
on
the
22d
day
of
October
,
but
on
the
10th
of
November
,
the
eve
of
Martinmas
day
,
from
whence
he
had
the
name
of
Martin

<EOS>
(
 
I
must
break
off
my
translation
for
a
moment
;
for
if
I
did
not
,
I
know
I
should
no
more
be
able
to
shut
my
eyes
in
bed
,
than
the
abbess
of

<EOS>
It
is
to
tell
the
reader
;
that
my
father
never
read
this
passage
of
Slawkenbergius
to
my
uncle
Toby
,
but
with
triumph
 
not
over
my
uncle
Toby
,
for
he
never
opposed
him
in
it
 
but
over
the
whole
world
.
    
<EOS>
Now
you
see
,
brother
Toby
,
he
would
say
,
looking
up
,
"
that
christian
names
are
not
such
indifferent
things
;
"
 
had
Luther
here
been
called
by
any
other
name
but
Martin
,
he
would
have
been
damn'd
to
all
eternity
 
<EOS>
Not
that
I
look
upon
Martin
,
he
would
add
,
as
a
good
name
 
far
from
it
 
'
tis
something
better
than
a
neutral
,
and
but
a
little
 
yet
little
as
it
is
you
see
it
was
of
some
service
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
knew
the
weakness
of
this
prop
to
his
hypothesis
,
as
well
as
the
best
logician
could
shew
him
 
yet
so
strange
is
the
weakness
of
man
at
the
same
time
,
as
it
fell
in
his
way
,
he
could
not
for
his
life
but
make
use
of
it
;
and
it
was
certainly
for
this
reason
,
that
though
there
are
many
stories
in
Hafen
Slawkenbergius
's
Decades
full
as
entertaining
as
this
I
am
translating
,
yet
there
is
not
one
amongst
them
which
my
father
read
over
with
half
the
delight
 
<EOS>
it
flattered
two
of
his
strangest
hypotheses
together
 
his
Names
and
his
Noses
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
be
bold
to
say
,
he
might
have
read
all
the
books
in
the
Alexandrian
Library
,
had
not
fate
taken
other
care
of
them
,
and
not
have
met
with
a
book
or
passage
in
one

hit
two
such
nails

these
upon
the

The
two
universities
of
Strasburg
were
hard
tugging
at
this
affair
of
Luther
's
navigation
.
 
<EOS>
The
Protestant
doctors
had
demonstrated
,
that
he
had
not
sailed
right
before
the
wind
,
as
the
Popish
doctors
had
pretended
;
and
as
every
one
knew
there
was
no
sailing
full
in
the
teeth
of
it
 
<EOS>
they
were
going
to
settle
,
in
case
he
had
sailed
,
how
many
points
he
was
off
;
whether
Martin
had
doubled
the
cape
,
or
had
fallen
upon
a
lee
-
shore
;
and
no
doubt
,
as
it
was
an
enquiry
of
much
edification
,
at
least
to
those
who
understood
this
sort
of
Navigation
,
they
had
gone
on
with
it
in
spite
of
the
size
of
the
stranger
's
nose
,
had
not
the
size
of
the
stranger
's
nose
drawn
off
the
attention
of
the
world
from
what
they
were
about
 
<EOS>
it
was
their
business
to
follow
.
  
<EOS>
The
abbess
of
Quedlingberg
and
her
four
dignitaries
was
no
stop
;
for
the
enormity
of
the
stranger
's
nose
running
full
as
much
in

It

replied
the

By

cried
the
Popish
doctors
,
he
can
make
a
nose
,
if
he
thinks
fit

as
big
as
the
steeple
of

Now
the

of
Strasburg
being
the
biggest
and
the
tallest
<EOS>
church-
steeple
to
be
seen
in
the
whole

<EOS>
,
the
Anti

nosarians
denied
that
a
nose
of
575
geometrical
feet
in
length
could
be
worn
,
at
least
by
a
middle-
siz'd
man
 
The
Popish
doctors
swore
it
could
 
<EOS>
The
Lutheran
doctors
said
No
;
 
it
could
not
.
  
<EOS>
This
at
once
started
a
new
dispute
,
which
they
pursued
a
great
way
,
upon
the
extent
and
limitation
of
the
moral
and
natural
attributes
of
God
 
<EOS>
That
controversy
led
them
naturally
into
Thomas

and
Thomas
Aquinas
to
the

<EOS>
The
stranger
's
nose
was
no
more
heard
of
in
the
dispute
 
<EOS>
it
just
served
as
a
frigate
to
launch
them
into
the
gulph

school

divinity

then
they
all
sailed
before

Heat
is
in

<EOS>
The
controversy
about
the
attributes
,
&

instead
of
cooling
,
on
the
contrary
had
inflamed
the
Strasburgers
imaginations
to
a
most
inordinate
degree
 
The
less
they
understood
of
the

the
greater
was
their
wonder

Haste

now
towards
the
catastrophe

tale
 
<EOS>
I
say
Catastrophe
(
cries
Slawkenbergius
)
inasmuch
as
a
tale
,
with
parts
rightly
disposed
,
not
only
rejoiceth
(
gaudet
)
in
the
Catastrophe
and
Peripeitia
of
a
Drama
,
but
rejoiceth
moreover
in
all
the
essential
and
integrant
parts
of
it
 
<EOS>
it
has
its
Protasis
,
Epitasis
,
Catastasis
,
<EOS>
its
Catastrophe
or
Peripeitia
growing
one
out
of
the
other
in
it
,
in
the
order
Aristotle
first
planted
them
  
without
which
a
tale
had
better
never
be
told
at
all
,
says
Slawkenbergius
,
but
be
kept
to
a
man
's
self
.
  
<EOS>
In
all
my
ten
tales
,
in
all
my
ten
decades
,
have
I
Slawkenbergius
tied
down
every
tale
of
them
as
tightly
to
this
rule
,
as
I
have
done
this
of
the
stranger
and
his
nose
.
    
<EOS>
From
his
first
parley
with
the
centinel
,
to
his
leaving
the
city
of
Strasburg
,
after
pulling
off
his
crimson
-
sattin
pair
of
breeches
,
is
the
Protasis
or
first
entrance
 
<EOS>
where
the
characters
of
the
Personae
Dramatis
are
just
touched
in
,
and
the
subject
slightly
begun
.
  
<EOS>
The
Epitasis
,
wherein
the
action
is
more
fully
entered
upon
and
heightened
,
till
it
arrives
at
its
state
or
height
called
the
Catastasis
,
and
which
usually
takes
up
the
2d
and
3d
act
,
is
included
within
that
busy
period
of
my
tale
,
betwixt
the
first
night
's
uproar
about
the
nose
,
to
the
conclusion
of
the
trumpeter
's
wife
's
lectures
upon
it
in
the
middle
of
the
grand
parade
:
 
and
from
the
first
embarking
of
the
learned
in
the
dispute
 
to
the
doctors
finally
sailing
away
,
and
leaving
the
Strasburgers
upon
the
 
beach
in
distress
,
is
the
Catastasis
or
the
ripening
of
the
incidents
and
passions
for
their
bursting
forth
in
the
fifth
act
.
  
<EOS>
This
commences
with
the
setting
out
of
the
Strasburgers
in
the
Frankfort
road
,
and
terminates
in
unwinding
the
labyrinth
and
bringing
the
hero
out
of
a
state
of
agitation
(
as
Aristotle
calls
it
)
to
a
state
of
rest
and
quietness
.
  
<EOS>
This
,
says
Hafen
Slawkenbergius
,
constitutes
the
Catastrophe
or
Peripeitia
of
my
tale
 
and
that
is
the
part
of
it
I
am
going
to
relate
.
  
<EOS>
We
left
the
stranger
behind
the
curtain
asleep
 
<EOS>
he
enters
now
upon
the
stage
.
    
<EOS>
What
dost
thou
prick
up
thy
ears
at
?
 
<EOS>
'
tis
nothing
but
a
man
upon
a
horse
 
was
the
last
word
the
stranger
uttered
to
his
mule
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
proper
then
to
tell
the
reader
,
that
the
mule
took
his
master
's
word
for
it
;
and
without
any
more
ifs
or
ands
,
let
the
traveller
and
his
horse
pass
by
.
  
<EOS>
The
traveller
was
hastening
with
all
diligence
to
get
to
Strasburg
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
fool
am
I
,
said
the
traveller
to
himself
,
when
he
had
rode
about
a
league
farther
,
to
think
of
getting
into
Strasburg
this
night
.
  
<EOS>
Strasburg
!
 
<EOS>
the
great
Strasburg
!
 
<EOS>
Strasburg
,
the
capital
of
all
Alsatia
!
 
<EOS>
Strasburg
,
an
imperial
city
!
 
<EOS>
Strasburg
,
a
sovereign
state
!
 
<EOS>
Strasburg
,
garrisoned
with
five
thousand
of
the
best
troops
in
all
the
world
!
 
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
if
I
was
at
the
gates
of
Strasburg
this
moment
,
I
could
not
gain
admittance
into
it
for
a
ducat
 
nay
a
ducat
and
<EOS>
half
 
'
tis
too
much
 
better
go
back
to
the
last
inn
I
have
passed
 
than
lie
<EOS>
I
know
not
where
 
or
give
I
know
not
<EOS>
what
.
 
<EOS>
The
traveller
,
as
he
made
these
reflections
in
his
mind
,
turned
his
horse
's
head
about
,
and
three
minutes
after
the
stranger
had
been
conducted
into
his
chamber
,
he
arrived
at
the
same
inn
.
    
<EOS>
We
have
bacon
in
the
house
,
said
the
host
,
and
bread
 
and
till
eleven
o'clock
this
night
had
three
eggs
in
it
 
but
<EOS>
a
stranger
,
who
arrived
an
hour
ago
,
has
had
them
dressed
into
an
omelet
,
and
we
have
nothing
.
    
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
said
the
traveller
,
harassed
as
I
am
<EOS>
,
I
want
nothing
but
a
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
one
as
soft
as
is
in
Alsatia
,
said
the
host
.
    
<EOS>
The
stranger
,
continued
he
,
should
have
slept
in
it
,
for
'
tis
my
best
bed
,
but
upon
the
score
of
his
nose
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
got
a
defluxion
,
said
the
traveller
.
 
<EOS>
Not
that
I
know
,
cried
the
host
.
 
<EOS>
But
'
tis
a
camp
-
bed
,
and
Jacinta
,
said
he
,
looking
towards
the
maid
,
imagined
there
was
not
room
in
it
to
turn
his
nose
in
.
 
<EOS>
Why
so
?
<EOS>
cried
the
traveller
,
starting
back
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
so
long
a
nose
,
replied
the
host
.
 
<EOS>
The
traveller
fixed
his
eyes
upon
Jacinta
,
then
upon
the
ground
 
kneeled
upon
his
right
knee
 
had
just
got
his
hand
laid
upon
his
breast
 
Trifle
not
with
my
anxiety
,
<EOS>
said
he
rising
up
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tis
no
trifle
,
said
Jacinta
,
'
tis
the
most
glorious
nose
!
 
<EOS>
The
traveller
fell
upon
his
knee
again
 
laid
his
hand
upon
his
breast
 
then
,
said
he
,
looking
up
to
heaven
,
thou
hast
conducted
me
to
the
end
of
my
pilgrimage
 
"
Tis
Diego

<EOS>
The
traveller
was
the
brother
of
the
Julia
,
so
often
invoked
that
night
by
the
stranger
as
he
rode
from
Strasburg
upon
his
mule
;
and
was
come
,
on
her
part
,
in
quest
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
accompanied
his
sister
from
Valadolid
across
the
Pyrenean
mountains
through
France
,
and
had
many
an
entangled
skein
to
wind
off
in
pursuit
of
him
through
the
many
meanders
and
abrupt
turnings
of
a
lover
's
thorny
tracks
.
    
<EOS>
Julia
had
sunk
under
it
 
and
had
not
been
able
to
go
a
step
farther
than
to
Lyons
,
where
,
with
the
many
disquietudes
of
a
tender
heart
,
which
all
talk
of
 
but
few
feel
 
she
sicken'd
,
but
had
just
strength
to
write
a
letter
to
Diego
;
and
having
conjured
her
brother
never
to
see
her
face
till
he
had
found
him
out
,
and
put
the
letter
into
his
hands
,
Julia
took
to
her
bed
.
  
<EOS>
Fernandez
<EOS>
(
for
that
was
her
brother
's
name
)
 
<EOS>
tho
'
<EOS>
the
camp
-
bed
was
as
soft
as
any
one
in
Alsace
,
yet
he
could
not
shut
his
eyes
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
it
was
day
he
rose
,
and
hearing
Diego
was
risen
too
,
he
entered
his
chamber
,
and
discharged
his
sister
's
commission
.
  
<EOS>
The
letter
was
as
follows
:
  
"
Seig
.
<EOS>
Diego
,
  
"
Whether
my
suspicions
of
your
nose
were
justly
excited
or
not
 
<EOS>
'
tis
not
now
to
inquire
 
<EOS>
it
is
enough
I
have
not
had
firmness
to
put
them
to
farther
tryal
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
could
I
know
so
little
of
myself
,
when
I
sent
my
Duenna
to
forbid
your
coming
more
under
my
lattice
?
<EOS>
or
how
could
I
know
so
little
of
you
,
Diego
,
as
to
imagine
you
would
not
have
staid
one
day
in
Valadolid
to
have
given
ease
to
my
doubts
?
 
<EOS>
Was
I
to
be
abandoned
,
Diego
,
because
I
was
deceived
?
<EOS>
or
was
it
kind
to
take
me
at
my
word
,
whether
my
suspicions
were
just
or
no
,
and
leave
me
,
as
you
did
,
a
prey
to
much
uncertainty
and
sorrow
?
  
<EOS>
"
In
what
manner
Julia
has
resented
this
 
my
brother
,
when
he
puts
this
letter
into
your
hands
,
will
tell
you
;
He
will
tell
you
in
how
few
moments
she
repented
of
the
rash
message
she
had
sent
you
 
in
what
frantic
haste
she
flew
to
her
lattice
,
and
how
many
days
and
nights
together
she
leaned
immoveably
upon
her
elbow
,
looking
through
it
towards
the
way
which
Diego
was
wo
nt
to
come
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
tell
you
,
when
she
heard
of
your
departure
 
<EOS>
how
her
spirits
deserted
her
 
<EOS>
how
her
heart
<EOS>
sicken'd
 
<EOS>
how
piteously
she
mourned
 
how
low
she
hung
her
head

<EOS>
O
Diego

<EOS>
how
many
weary
steps
has
my
brother
's
pity
led
me
by
the
hand
languishing
to
trace
out
yours

how
far
has
desire
carried
me
beyond

and
<EOS>
how
oft
have
I
fainted
by
the
way
,
and
sunk
into
his
arms
,
with
only
power
to
cry
out
 
O

If

Slawkenbergius
supposes
the

was
unconvinced
,
but
her
strength
would
not
enable
her
to
finish
her

<EOS>
The
heart
of
the
courteous
Diego
over
-
flowed
as
he
read
the
letter
 
<EOS>
he
ordered
his
mule
forthwith
and
Fernandez
's
horse
to
be
saddled
;
and
as
no
vent
in
prose
is
equal
to
that
of
poetry
in
such
conflicts
 
chance

which
as
often
directs
us
to
remedies
as
to
diseases

having
thrown
a
piece
of
charcoal
into
the
window
 
Diego
availed
himself
of
it
,
and
whilst
the
hostler
was
getting
ready

his
mule

he
eased
his

Harsh
and
untuneful
are
the
notes
of
love

Unless
my
Julia
strikes
the
key

Her
hand
alone
can
touch
the

Whose

movement
charms

O
Julia
!
  
<EOS>
The
lines
were
very
natural
 
<EOS>
for
they
were
nothing
at
all
to
the
purpose
,
says
Slawkenbergius
,
and
'
tis
a
pity
<EOS>
there
were
no
more
of
them
;
but
whether
it
was
that
Seig
.
<EOS>
Diego
was
slow
in
composing
verses
 
or
the
hostler
quick
in
saddling
mules
 
is
not
averred
;
certain
it
was
,
that
Diego
's
mule
and
Fernandez
's
horse
were
ready
at
the
door
of
the
inn
,
before
Diego
was
ready
for
his
second
stanza
;
so
without
staying
to
finish
his
ode
,
they
both
mounted
,
sallied
forth
,
passed
the
Rhine
,
traversed
Alsace
,
shaped
their
course
towards
Lyons
,
and
before
the
Strasburgers
and
the
abbess
of
Quedlingberg
had
set
out
on
their
cavalcade
,
had
Fernandez
,
Diego
,
and
his
Julia
,
crossed
the
Pyrenean
mountains
,
and
got
safe
to
Valadolid
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
needless
to
inform
the
geographical
reader
,
that
when
Diego
was
in
Spain
,
it
was
not
possible
to
meet
the
courteous
stranger
in
the
Frankfort
road
;
it
is
enough
to
say
,
that
of
all
restless
desires
,
curiosity
being
the
strongest
 
<EOS>
the
Strasburgers
felt
the
full
force
of
it
;
and
that
for
three
days
and
nights
they
were
tossed
to
and
fro
in
the
Frankfort
road
,
with
the
tempestuous
fury
of
this
passion
,
before
they
could
submit
to
return
home
.
 
<EOS>
When
alas
!
<EOS>
an
event
was
prepared
for
them
,
of
all
other
,
the
most
grievous
that
could
befal
a
free
people
.
  
<EOS>
As
this
revolution
of
the
Strasburgers
affairs
is
often
spoken
of
,
and
little
understood
,
I
will
,
in
ten
words
,
says
Slawkenbergius
,
give
the
world
an
explanation
of
it
,
and
with
it
put
an
end
to
my
tale
.
  
<EOS>
Every
body
knows
of
the
grand
system
of
Universal
Monarchy
,
wrote
by
order
of
Mons
.
<EOS>
Colbert
,
and
put
in
manuscript
into
the
hands
of
Lewis
the
fourteenth
,
in
the
year
1664
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
<EOS>
as
well
known
,
that
one
branch
out
of
many
of
that
system
,
was
the
getting
possession
of
Strasburg
,
to
favour
an
entrance
at
all
times
into
Suabia
,
in
order
to
disturb
the
quiet
of
Germany
 
and
that
in
consequence
of
this
plan
,
Strasburg
unhappily
fell
at
length
into
their
hands
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
the
lot
of
a
few
to
trace
out
the
true
springs
of
this
and
such
like
revolutions
 
<EOS>
The
vulgar
look
too
high
for
them
 
<EOS>
Statesmen
look
too
low
  
Truth
(
for
once
)
lies
in
the
middle
.
  
<EOS>
What
a
fatal
thing
is
the
popular
pride
of
a
free
city
!
<EOS>
cries
one
historian
 
<EOS>
The
Strasburgers
deemed
it
a
diminution
of
their
freedom
to
receive
an
imperial
garrison
 
so
fell
a
prey
to
a
French
one
.
  
<EOS>
The
fate
,
says
another
,
of
the
Strasburgers
,
may
be
a
warning
to
all
free
people
to
save
their
money
.
 
<EOS>
They
anticipated
their
revenues
 
<EOS>
brought
themselves
under
taxes
,
exhausted
their
strength
,
and
in
the
end
became
so
weak
a
people
<EOS>
,
they
had
not
strength
to
keep
their
gates
shut
,
and
so
the
French
pushed
them
open
.
  
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
cries
Slawkenbergius
,
'
twas
not
<EOS>
the
French

'
twas
Curiosity
pushed
them
open
 
<EOS>
The
French
indeed
,
who
are
ever
upon
the
catch
,
when
they
saw
the
Strasburgers
,
men
,
women
and
children
,
all
marched
out
to
follow
the
stranger
's
nose
 
<EOS>
each
man
followed
his
own
,
and
marched
in
.
  
<EOS>
Trade
and
manufactures
have
decayed
and
gradually
grown
down
ever
since
  
but
not
from
any
cause
which
commercial
heads
have
assigned
;
for
it
is
owing
to
this
only
,
that
Noses
have
ever
so
run
in
their
heads
,
that
the
Strasburgers
could
not
follow
their
business
.
  
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
cries
Slawkenbergius
,
making
an
exclamation
 
it
is
not
the
first
 
<EOS>
and
I
fear
will
not
be
the
last
fortress
that
has
been
either
won
  
or
lost
by
Noses
.

The
End
of
Slawkenbergius
's
Tale
.
    
<EOS>
With
all
this
learning
upon
Noses
running
perpetually
in
my
father
's
fancy
 
with
so
many
family
prejudices
 
and
ten
decades
of
such
tales
running
on
for
ever
along
with
them
 
<EOS>
how
was
it
possible
with
such
exquisite
 
was
it
a
true
nose
?
 
<EOS>
That
a
man
with
such
exquisite
feelings
as
my
father
had
,
could
bear
the
shock
at
all
below
stairs
 
or
indeed
above
stairs
,
in
any
other
posture
,
but
the
very
posture
I
have
described
?
    
<EOS>
Throw
yourself
down
upon
the
bed
,
a
dozen
times
 
taking
care
only
to
place
a
looking
-
glass
first
in
a
chair
on
one
side
of
it
,
before
you
do
it
 
<EOS>
But
was
the
stranger
's
nose
a
true
nose
,
or
was
it
a
false
one
?
  
<EOS>
To
tell
that
before
-
hand
,
madam
,
would
be
to
do
injury
to
one
of
the
best
tales
in
the
Christian
-
world
;
and
that
is
the
tenth
of
the
tenth
decade
,
which
immediately
follows
this
.
  
<EOS>
This
tale
,
cried
Slawkenbergius
,
somewhat
exultingly
,
has
been
reserved
by
me
for
the
concluding
tale
of
my
whole
work
;
knowing
right
well
,
that
when
I
shall
have
told
it
,
and
my
reader
shall
have
read
it
thro

twould
be
even
high
time
for
both
of
us
to
shut
up
the
book
;
inasmuch
,
continues
Slawkenbergius
,
as
I
know
of
no
tale
which
could
possibly
ever
go
down
after
it
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
a
tale
indeed
!
  
<EOS>
This
sets
out
with
the
first
interview
in
the
inn
at
Lyons
,
when
Fernandez
left
the
courteous
stranger
and
his
sister
Julia
alone
in
her
chamber
,
and
is
over

written

<EOS>
The
Intricacies
of
Diego
and
Julia
.
  
<EOS>
Heavens
!
<EOS>
thou
art
<EOS>
a
strange
creature
,
Slawkenbergius
!
<EOS>
what
a
whimsical
view
of
the
involutions
of
the
heart
of
woman
hast
thou
opened
!
<EOS>
how
this
can
ever
be
translated
,
and
yet
if
this
specimen
of
Slawkenbergius
's
tales
,
and
the
exquisitiveness
of
his
moral
,
should
please
the
world
 
translated
shall
a
couple
of
volumes
be
.
 
<EOS>
Else
,
how
this
can
ever
be
translated
into
good
English
,
I
have
no
sort
of
conception
 
There
seems
in
some
passages
to
want
a
sixth
sense
to
do
it
rightly
.
 
<EOS>
What
can
he
mean
by
the
lambent
pupilability
of
slow
,
low
,
dry
chat
,
five
notes
below
the
natural
tone
  
which
you
know
,
madam
,
is
little
more
than
a
whisper
?
 
<EOS>
The
moment
I
pronounced
the
words
,
I
could
perceive
an
attempt
towards
a
vibration
in
the
strings
,
about
the
region
of
the
heart
.
 
<EOS>
The
brain
made
no
acknowledgment
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
often
no
good
understanding
<EOS>
betwixt
'em
 
<EOS>
I
felt
as
if
I
understood
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
no
ideas
.
 
<EOS>
The
movement
could
not
be
without
cause
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
lost
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
make
nothing
of
it
 
unless
,
may
it
please
your
worships
,
the
voice
,
in
that
case
being
little
more
than
a
whisper
,
unavoidably
forces
the
eyes
to
approach
not
only
within
six
inches
of
each
other
 
but
to
look
into
the
pupils
 
is
not
that
dangerous
?
 
<EOS>
But
it
ca
n't
be
avoided
 
for
to
look
up
to
the
cieling
,
in
that
case
the
two
chins
unavoidably
meet
 
and
to
look
down
into
each
other
's
lap
,
the
foreheads
come
to
immediate
contact
,
which
at
once
puts
an
end
to
the
conference
 
<EOS>
I
mean
to
the
sentimental
part
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
left
,
madam
,
is
not
worth
stooping
for
.
    
<EOS>
My
father
lay
stretched
across
the
bed
as
still
as
if
the
hand
of
death
had
pushed
him
down
,
for
a
full
hour
and
a
half
before
he
began
to
play
upon
the
floor
with
the
toe
of
that
foot
which
hung
over
the
bed
-
side
;
my
uncle
Toby
's
heart
was
a
pound
lighter
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
few
moments
,
his
left
-
hand
,
the
knuckles
of
which
had
all
the
time
reclined
upon
the
handle
of
the
chamber
-
pot
,
came
to
its
feeling
 
<EOS>
he
thrust
it
a
little
more
within
the
valance
 
drew
up
his
hand
,
when
he
had
done
,
into
his
bosom
 
<EOS>
gave
a
hem
!
 
<EOS>
My
good
uncle
Toby
,
with
infinite
pleasure
,
answered
it
;
and
full
gladly
would
have
ingrafted
a
sentence
of
consolation
upon
the
opening
it
afforded
:
 
but
having
no
talents
,
as
I
said
,
that
way
,
and
fearing
moreover
that
he
might
set
out
with
something
which
might
make
a
bad
matter
worse
,
he
contented
himself
with
resting
his
chin
placidly
upon
the
cross
of
his
crutch
.
  
<EOS>
Now
whether
the
compression
shortened
my
uncle
Toby
's
face
into
a
more
pleasurable
oval
 
or
that
the
philanthropy
of
his
heart
,
in
seeing
his
brother
beginning
to
emerge
out
of
the
sea
of
his
afflictions
,
had
braced
up
his
muscles
 
so
that
the
compression
upon
his
chin
only
doubled
the
benignity
which
was
there
before
,
is
not
hard
to
decide
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
,
in
turning
his
eyes
,
was
struck
with
such
a
gleam
of
sun
-
shine
in
his
face
,
as
melted
down
the
sullenness
of
his
grief
in
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
He
broke
silence
as
follows
:
    
Did
ever
man
,
brother
Toby
,
cried
my
father
,
raising
himself
upon
his
elbow
,
and
turning
himself
round
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
bed
,
where
my
uncle
Toby
was
sitting
in
his
old
fringed
chair
,
with
his
chin
resting
upon
his
crutch
 
did
ever
a
poor
unfortunate
man
,
brother
Toby
,
cried
my
father
,
receive
so
many
lashes
?
 
<EOS>
The
most
I
ever
saw
given
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
(
ringing
the
bell
at
the
bed
's
head
for
Trim
)
was
to
a
grenadier
,
I
think
in
Mackay
's
regiment
.
    
<EOS>
Had
my
uncle
Toby
shot
a
bullet
through
my
father
's
heart
,
he
could
not
have
fallen
down
with
his
nose
upon
the
quilt
more
suddenly
.
  
<EOS>
Bless
me
!
<EOS>
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
    
<EOS>
Was
it
Mackay
's
regiment
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
where
the
poor
grenadier
was
so
unmercifully
whipp'd
<EOS>
at
Bruges
about
the
ducats
?
 
<EOS>
O
Christ
!
<EOS>
he
was
innocent
!
<EOS>
cried
Trim
,
with
a
deep
sigh
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
was
whipp'd
,
may
it
please
your
honour
,
almost
to
death
's
door
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
better
have
shot
him
outright
,
as
he
begg'd
,
and
he
had
gone
directly
to
heaven
,
for
he
was
as
innocent
as
your
honour
.
 
<EOS>
I
thank
thee
,
Trim
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
think
of
his
,
continued
Trim
,
and
my
poor
brother
Tom
's
misfortunes
,
for
we
were
all
three
school
-
fellows
,
but
I
cry
like
a
coward
.
 
<EOS>
Tears
are
no
proof
of
cowardice
,
Trim
.
 
<EOS>
I
drop
them
oft
-
times
myself
,
cried
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
your
honour
does
,
replied
Trim
,
and
so
am
not
ashamed
of
it
myself
.
  
<EOS>
But
to
think
,
may
it
please
your
honour
,
continued
Trim
,
a
tear
stealing
into
the
corner
of
his
eye
as
he
spoke
 
to
think
of
two
virtuous
lads
with
hearts
as
warm
in
their
bodies
,
and
as
honest
as
God
could
make
them
 
the
children
of
honest
people
,
going
forth
with
gallant
spirits
to
seek
their
fortunes
in
the
world
 
and
fall
into
such
evils
!
 
<EOS>
poor
Tom
!
<EOS>
to
be
tortured
upon
a
rack
for
nothing
 
but
marrying
a
Jew
's
widow
who
sold
sausages
  
<EOS>
honest
Dick
Johnson
's
soul
to
be
scourged
out
of
his
body
,
for
the
ducats
another
man
put
into
his
knapsack
!
 
<EOS>
O
!
 
<EOS>
these
are
misfortunes
,
cried
Trim
,
 
pulling
out
his
handkerchief
 
<EOS>
these
are
misfortunes
,
may
it
please
your
honour
,
worth
lying
down
and
crying
over
.
    
<EOS>
My
father
could
not
help
blushing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Twould
be
a
pity
,
Trim
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
thou
shouldst
ever
feel
sorrow
of
thy
own
 
thou
feelest
it
<EOS>
so
tenderly
for
others
.
 
<EOS>
Alack
-
o

day
,
replied
the
corporal
,
brightening
up
his
face
 
<EOS>
your
honour
knows
I
have
neither
wife
or
child
 
<EOS>
I
can
have
no
sorrows
in
this
world

<EOS>
My
father
could
not
help
smiling
.
 
<EOS>
As
few
as
any
man
,
Trim
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
;
nor
can
I
see
how
a
fellow
of
thy
light
heart
can
suffer
,
but
from
the
distress
of
poverty
in
thy
old
age
 
when
thou
art
passed
all
services
,
Trim
 
and
hast
outlived
thy

<EOS>
An
'
please
your
honour
,
never
fear
,
replied
Trim
,
chearily
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
would
have
<EOS>
thee
never
fear
,
Trim
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
,
and
therefore
,
continued
my
uncle
Toby
,
throwing
down
his
crutch
,
and
getting
up
upon
his
legs
as
he
uttered
the
word
therefore
 
in
recompence
,
Trim
,
of
thy
long
fidelity
to
me
,
and
that
goodness
of
thy
heart
<EOS>
I
have
had
such
proofs
of
 
whilst
<EOS>
thy
master
is
worth
a
shilling
  
<EOS>
thou
shalt
never
ask
elsewhere
,
Trim
,
for
a
penny
.
 
<EOS>
Trim
attempted
to
thank
my
uncle
Toby
 
but
had
not
power
 
tears
trickled
down
his
cheeks
faster
than
he
could
wipe
them
off
 
<EOS>
He
laid
his
hands
upon
his
breast
 
made
a
bow
to
the
ground
,
and
shut
the
door
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
left
Trim
my
bowling
-
green
,
cried
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
My
father
smiled
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
left
him
moreover
a
pension
,
continued
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
looked
grave
.
    
<EOS>
Is
this
a
fit
time
,
said
my
father
to
himself
,
to
talk
of
Pensions
and
Grenadiers
?
    
<EOS>
When
my
uncle
Toby
first
mentioned
the
grenadier
,
my
father
,
I
said
,
fell
down
with
his
nose
flat
to
the
quilt
,
and
as
suddenly
as
if
my
uncle
Toby
had
shot
him
;
but
it
was
not
added
that
every
other
limb
and
member
of
my
father
instantly
relapsed
with
his
nose
into
the
same
precise
attitude
in
which
he
lay
first
described
;
so
that
when
corporal
Trim
left
the
room
,
and
my
father
found
himself
disposed
to
rise
off
the
bed
 
<EOS>
he
had
all
the
little
preparatory
movements
to
run
over
again
,
before
he
could
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
Attitudes
are
nothing
,
madam
 
'
<EOS>
tis
the
transition
from
one
attitude
to
another
 
like
the
preparation
and
resolution
of
the
discord
into
harmony
,
which
is
all
in
all
.
  
<EOS>
For
which
reason
my
father
played
the
same
jig
over
again
with
his
toe
upon
the
floor
 
pushed
the
chamber
-
pot
still
a
little
farther
within
the
valance
 
gave
a
hem
 
raised
himself
up
upon
his
elbow
 
and
was
just
beginning
to
address
himself
to
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
 
<EOS>
when
recollecting
the
unsuccessfulness
of
his
first
effort
in
that
attitude
 
he
got
upon
his
legs
,
and
in
making
the
third
turn
across
the
room
,
he
stopped
short
before
my
uncle
Toby
;
and
laying
the
three
first
fingers
of
his
right
-
hand
in
the
palm
of
his
left
,
and
stooping
a
little
,
he
addressed
himself
to
my
uncle
Toby
as
follows
:
    
<EOS>
When
I
reflect
,
brother
Toby
,
upon
Man
;
and
take
a
view
of
that
dark
side
of
him
which
represents
his
life
as
open
to
so
many
causes
of
trouble
 
when
I
consider
,
brother
Toby
,
how
oft
we
eat
the
bread
of
affliction
,
and
that
we
are
born
to
it
,
as
to
the
portion
of
our
inheritance
 
<EOS>
I
was
born
to
nothing
,
<EOS>
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
interrupting
my
father
 
but
my
commission
.
 
<EOS>
Zooks
!
<EOS>
said
my
father
,
did
not
my
uncle
leave
you
a
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
a
year
?
 
<EOS>
What
could
I
have
done
without
it
?
<EOS>
replied
my
uncle
Toby
  
<EOS>
That
's
another
concern
,
said
my
father
testily
 
<EOS>
But
I
say
Toby
,
when
one
runs
over
the
catalogue
of
all
the
cross
-
reckonings
and
sorrowful
Items
with
which
the
heart
of
man
is
overcharged
,
'
<EOS>
tis
wonderful
by
what
hidden
resources
<EOS>
the
mind
is
enabled
to
stand
out
,
and
bear
itself
up
,
as
it
does
,
against
the
impositions
laid
upon
our
nature
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tis
by
the
assistance
of
Almighty
God
,
cried
my
uncle
Toby
,
looking
up
,
and
pressing
the
palms
of
his
hands
close
together
 
'
tis
not
from
our
own
strength
,
brother
Shandy
 
<EOS>
a
centinel
in
a
wooden
centry
-
box
might
as
well
pretend
to
stand
it
out
against
a
detachment
of
fifty
men
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
upheld
by
the
grace
and
the
assistance
of
the
best
of
Beings
.
    
<EOS>
That
is
cutting
the
knot
,
said
my
father
,
instead
of
untying
it
,
 
But
give
me
leave
to
lead
you
,
brother
Toby
,
a
little
deeper
into
the
mystery
.
  
<EOS>
With
all
my
heart
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
instantly
exchanged
the
attitude
he
was
in
,
for
that
in
which
Socrates
is
so
finely
painted
by
Raffael
in
his
school
of
Athens
;
which
your
connoisseurship
knows
is
so
exquisitely
imagined
,
that
even
the
particular
manner
of
the
reasoning
of
Socrates
is
expressed
by
it
 
for
he
holds
the
fore
-
finger
of
his
left
-
hand
between
the
fore
-
finger
and
the
thumb
of
his
right
,
and
seems
as
if
he
was
saying
to
the
libertine
he
is
reclaiming
 
<EOS>
"
You
grant
me
this
 
<EOS>
and
this
:
 
and
this
,
<EOS>
and
this
,
I
do
n't
ask
of
you
 
<EOS>
they
follow
of
themselves
in
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
stood
my
father
,
holding
fast
his
fore
-
finger
betwixt
his
finger
and
his
thumb
,
and
reasoning
with
my
uncle
Toby
as
he
sat
in
his
old
fringed
chair
,
valanced
around
with
party
-
coloured
worsted
bobs
 
<EOS>
O
Garrick
!
 
<EOS>
what
a
rich
scene
of
this
would
thy
exquisite
powers
make
!
<EOS>
and
how
gladly
would
I
write
such
another
to
avail
myself
of
thy
immortality
,
and
secure
my
own
behind
it
.
    
<EOS>
Though
man
is
of
all
others
the
most
curious
vehicle
,
said
my
father
,
yet
at
the
same
time
'
tis
of
so
slight
a
frame
,
and
so
totteringly
put
together
,
that
the
sudden
jerks
and
hard
jostlings
<EOS>
it
unavoidably
meets
with
in
this
rugged
journey
,
would
overset
and
tear
it
to
pieces
<EOS>
a
dozen
times
a
day
 
was
it
not
,
brother
Toby
,
that
there
is
a
secret
spring
within
us
.
 
<EOS>
Which
spring
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
I
take
to
be
Religion
.
 
<EOS>
Will
that
set
my
child
's
nose
on
?
<EOS>
cried
my
father
,
letting
go
his
finger
,
and
striking
one
hand
against
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
It
makes
every
thing
straight
for
us
,
answered
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
Figuratively
speaking
,
dear
Toby
,
it
may
,
for
aught
I
know
,
said
my
father
;
but
the
spring
I
am
speaking
of
,
is
that
great
and
elastic
power
within
us
of
counterbalancing
evil
,
which
,
like
a
secret
spring
in
a
well
-
ordered
machine
,
though
it
ca
n't
prevent
the
shock
 
at
least
it
imposes
upon
our
sense
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
my
dear
brother
,
said
my
father
,
replacing
his
fore
-
finger
,
as
he
was
coming
closer
to
the
point
 
<EOS>
had
my
child
arrived
safe
into
the
world
,
<EOS>
unmartyr'd
in
that
precious
part
of
him
 
fanciful
and
extravagant
as
I
may
appear
to
the
world
in
my
opinion
of
christian
names
,
and
of
that
magic
bias
which
good
or
bad
names
irresistibly
impress
upon
our
characters
and
conducts
 
Heaven
is
witness
!
<EOS>
that
in
the
warmest
transports
of
my
wishes
for
the
prosperity
of
my
child
,
I
never
once
wished
to
crown
his
head
with
more
glory
and
honour
than
what
George
or
Edward
would
have
spread
around
it
.
  
<EOS>
But
alas
!
<EOS>
continued
my
father
,
as
the
greatest
evil
has
befallen
him
 
<EOS>
I
must
counteract
and
undo
it
with
the
greatest
good
.
  
<EOS>
He
shall
be
christened
Trismegistus
,
brother
.
  
<EOS>
I
wish
it
may
answer
 
<EOS>
replied
my
uncle
Toby
,
rising
up
.
    
<EOS>
What
a
chapter
of
chances
,
said
my
father
,
turning
himself
about
upon
the
first
landing
,
as
he
and
my
uncle
Toby
were
going
down
stairs
,
what
a
long
chapter
of
chances
do
the
events
of
this
world
lay
open
to
us
!
 
<EOS>
Take
pen
and
ink
in
hand
,
brother
Toby
,
and
calculate
it
fairly
 
<EOS>
I
know
no
more
of
calculation
than
this
balluster
,
said
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
(
striking
short
of
it
with
his
crutch
,
and
hitting
my
father
a
desperate
blow
souse
upon
his
shin
-
bone
)
 
'
Twas
a
hundred
to
one
-
cried
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
 
<EOS>
I
thought
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
father
,
(
rubbing
his
shin
)
<EOS>
you
had
known
nothing
of
calculations
,
brother
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
a
mere
chance
<EOS>
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
Then
it
adds
one
to
the
chapter
 
replied
my
father
.
  
<EOS>
The
double
success
of
my
father
's
repartees
tickled
off
the
pain
of
his
shin
at
once
 
<EOS>
it
was
well
<EOS>
it
so
fell
out
 
(
chance
!
<EOS>
again
)
 
or
the
world
to
this
day
had
never
known
the
subject
of
my
father
's
calculation
 
to
guess
it
 
<EOS>
there
was
no
chance
 
<EOS>
What
a
lucky
chapter
of
chances
has
this
turned
out
!
<EOS>
for
it
has
saved
me
the
trouble
of
writing
one
express
,
and
in
truth
I
have
enough
already
upon
my
hands
without
it
.
 
<EOS>
Have
not
I
promised
the
world
a
chapter
of
knots
?
<EOS>
two
chapters
upon
the
right
and
the
wrong
end
of
a
woman
?
<EOS>
a
chapter
upon
whiskers
?
<EOS>
a
chapter
upon
wishes
?
 
<EOS>
a
chapter
of
noses
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
I
have
done
that
 
a
chapter
upon
my
uncle
Toby
's
modesty
?
<EOS>
to
say
nothing
of
a
chapter
upon
chapters
,
which
I
will
finish
before
I
sleep
 
by
my
great
grandfather
's
whiskers
,
I
shall
never
get
half
of
'em
through
this
year
.
  
<EOS>
Take
pen
and
ink
in
hand
,
and
calculate
it
fairly
,
brother
Toby
,
said
my
father
,
and
it
will
turn
out
a
million
to
one
,
that
of
all
the
parts
of
the
body
,
the
edge
of
the
forceps
should
have
the
ill
luck
just
to
fall
upon
and
break
down
that
one
part
,
which
should
break
down
the
fortunes
of
our
house
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
might
have
been
worse
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
comprehend
,
said
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
Suppose
the
hip
had
presented
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
,
as
Dr.
Slop
foreboded
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
reflected
half
a
minute
 
looked
down
 
touched
the
middle
of
his
forehead
slightly
with
his
finger
      
True
,
said
he
.
    
<EOS>
Is
it
not
a
shame
to
make
two
chapters
of
what
passed
in
going
down
one
pair
of
stairs
?
<EOS>
for
we
are
got
no
farther
yet
than
to
the
first
landing
,
and
there
are
fifteen
more
steps
down
to
the
bottom
;
and
for
aught
I
know
,
as
my
father
and
my
uncle
Toby
are
in
a
talking
humour
,
there
may
be
as
many
chapters
as
steps
:
 
<EOS>
let
that
be
as
it
will
,
Sir
,
I
can
no
more
help
it
than
my
destiny
:
 
<EOS>
A
sudden
impulse
comes
across
me
 
<EOS>
drop
the
curtain
<EOS>
,
Shandy
 
I
drop
it
 
Strike
a
line
here
across
the
paper
,
Tristram
 
I
strike
it
 
<EOS>
and
hey
for
a
new
chapter
.
  
<EOS>
The
deuce
of
any
other
rule
have
I
to
govern
myself
by
in
this
affair
 
<EOS>
and
if
I
had
one
 
as
I
do
all
things
out
of
all
rule
 
I
would
twist
it
and
tear
it
to
pieces
,
and
throw
it
into
the
fire
when
I
had
done
 
<EOS>
Am
I
warm
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
,
and
the
cause
demands
it
 
a
pretty
story
!
<EOS>
is
a
man
to
follow
rules
 
or
rules
to
follow
him
?
  
<EOS>
Now
this
,
you
must
know
,
being
my
chapter
upon
chapters
,
which
I
promised
to
write
before
I
went
to
sleep
<EOS>
,
I
thought
it
meet
to
ease
my
conscience
entirely
before
I
laid
down
,
by
telling
the
world
all
I
knew
about
the
matter
at
once
:
 
Is
not
this
ten
times
better
than
to
set
out
dogmatically
with
a
sententious
parade
of
wisdom
,
and
telling
the
world
a
story
of
a
roasted
horse
 
that
chapters
relieve
the
mind
 
that
they
assist
 
or
impose
upon
the
imagination
 
and
that
in
a
work
of
this
dramatic
cast
they
are
as
necessary
as
the
shifting
of
scenes
 
with
fifty
other
cold
conceits
,
enough
to
extinguish
the
fire
which
roasted
him
?
 
<EOS>
O
!
<EOS>
but
to
understand
this
,
which
is
a
puff
at
the
fire
of
Diana
's
temple
 
you
must
read
Longinus
 
<EOS>
read
away
 
<EOS>
if
you
are
not
a
jot
the
wiser
by
reading
him
the
first
time
over
 
never
fear
 
read
him
again
 
Avicenna
and
Licetus
read
Aristotle
's
metaphysicks
forty
times
through
a
-
piece
,
and
never
understood
a
single
word
.
 
<EOS>
But
mark
the
consequence
 
<EOS>
Avicenna
turned
out
a
desperate
writer
at
all
kinds
of
writing
 
for
he
wrote
books
de
omni
scribili
;
and
for
Licetus
(
Fortunio
)
though
all
the
world
knows
he
was
born
a
foetus
,
(

<EOS>
he
grew
to

I

So
much
for
my
chapter
upon
chapters
,
which
I
hold
to
be
the
best
chapter
in
my

whoever

is
full

We
shall
bring
all

said
my
father
,
setting
his
foot
upon
the
first
step
from
the
landing
.
 
<EOS>
This
Trismegistus
,
continued
my
father
,
drawing
his
leg
back
and
turning
to
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
 
was
the
greatest
(
Toby
)
of
all
earthly
beings
 
<EOS>
he
was
the
greatest
king
 
<EOS>
the
greatest
lawgiver
 
the
greatest

and
the
greatest
priest
 
and

<EOS>
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
    
<EOS>
In
course
,
said
my
father
.
      
<EOS>
And
how
does
your
mistress
?
<EOS>
cried
my
father
,
taking
the
same
step
over
again
from
the
landing
,
and
calling
to
Susannah
,
whom
he
saw
passing
by
the
foot
of
the
stairs
with
a
huge
pin
-
cushion
in
her
hand
 
<EOS>
how
does
your
mistress
?
 
<EOS>
As
well
,
said
Susannah
,
tripping
by
,
but
without
looking
up
,
as
can
be
expected
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
fool
am
I
!
<EOS>
said
my
father
,
drawing
his
leg
back
again
 
<EOS>
let
things
be
as
they
will
,
brother
Toby
,
'
tis
ever
the
precise
answer
 
<EOS>
And
how
is
the
child
,
pray
?
 
<EOS>
No
answer
.
 
<EOS>
And
where
is
Dr.
Slop
?
<EOS>
added
my
father
,
raising
his
voice
aloud
,
and
looking
over
the
ballusters
  
<EOS>
Susannah
was
out
of
hearing
.
  
<EOS>
Of
all
the
riddles
of
a
married
life
,
said
my
father
,
crossing
the
landing
in
order
to
set
his
back
against
the
wall
,
whilst
he
propounded
it
to
my
uncle
Toby
 
of
all
the
puzzling
riddles
,
said
he
,
in
a
marriage
state
,
 
of
which
you
may
trust
me
,
brother
Toby
<EOS>
,
there
are
more
asses
loads
than
all
Job
's
stock
of
asses
could
have
carried
 
there
is
not
one
that
has
more
intricacies
in
it
than
this
 
<EOS>
that
from
the
very
moment
the
mistress
of
the
house
is
brought
to
bed
,
every
female
in
it
,
from
my
lady
's
gentlewoman
down
to
the
cinder
-
wench
,
becomes
an
inch
taller
for
it
;
and
give
themselves
more
airs
upon
that
single
inch
,
than
all
their
other
inches
put
together
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
rather
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
,
<EOS>
that
'
tis
we
who
sink
an
inch
lower
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
meet
but
a
woman
with
child
 
<EOS>
I
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tis
a
heavy
tax
upon
that
half
of
our
fellow

creatures
,
brother
Shandy
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
a
piteous
burden
upon
'em
,
continued
he
,
shaking
his
head
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
'
tis
a
painful
thing
 
said
my
father
,
shaking
his
head
too
 
but
certainly
since
shaking
of
heads
came
into
fashion
,
never
did
two
heads
shake
together
,
in
concert
,
from
two
such
different
springs
.
  
<EOS>
God

<EOS>
Deuce
take
'em
all
 
<EOS>
said
my
uncle
Toby
and
my

,
each
to
himself

<EOS>
Holla

<EOS>
you
,

<EOS>
here
's
sixpence
 
do
step
into
that
bookseller
's
shop

and
call
me
a
day
-
tall
critick

<EOS>
I
am
very
willing
to
give
any
one
of
'em
a
crown
to
help
me
with
his
tackling
,
to
get
my
father
and
my
uncle
Toby
off
the
stairs
,
and
to
put
them
to
bed
.
    
<EOS>
'
Tis
even
high
time
;
for
except
a
short
nap
,
which
they
both
got
whilst
Trim
was
boring
the
jack
-
boots
 
and
which
,
by
-
the
-
bye
,
did
my
father
<EOS>
no
sort
of
good
,
upon
the
score
of
the
bad
hinge
 
they
have
not
else
shut
their
eyes
,
since
nine
hours
before
the
time
that
doctor
Slop
was
led
into
the
back
parlour
in
that
dirty
pickle
by
Obadiah
.
  
<EOS>
Was
every
day
of
my
life
to
be
as
busy
a
day
as
this
 
and
to
take
up
  
Truce
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
not
finish
that
sentence
till
I
have
made
an
observation
upon
the
strange
state
of
affairs
between
the
reader
and
myself
,
just
as
things
stand
at
present
 
an
observation
never
applicable
before
to
any
one
biographical
writer
since
the
creation
of
the
world
,
but
to
myself
 
<EOS>
and
I
believe
,
will
never
hold
good
to
any
other
,
until
its
final
destruction
  
and
therefore
,
for
the
very
novelty
of
it
alone
,
it
must
be
worth
your
worships
attending
to
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
this
month
one
whole
year
older
than
I
was
this
time
twelve
-
month
;
and
having
got
,
as
you
perceive
,
almost
into
the
middle
of
my
third
volume
(
According
to
the
preceding
Editions
.
)
 
<EOS>
and
no
farther
than
to
my
first
day
's
life
 
'
tis
demonstrative
that
I
have
three
hundred
and
sixty
-
four
days
more
life
to
write
just
now
,
than
when
I
first
set
out
;
so
that
instead
of
advancing
,
as
a
common
writer
,
in
my
work
with
what
I
have
been
doing
at
it
 
on
the
contrary
,
I
am
just
thrown
so
many
volumes
back
 
<EOS>
was
every
day
of
my
life
to
be
as
busy
a
day
as
this
 
<EOS>
And
why
not
?
 
<EOS>
and
the
transactions
and
opinions
of
it
to
take
up
as
much
description
 
<EOS>
And
for
what
reason
should
they
be
cut
short
?
<EOS>
as
at
this
rate
I
should
just
live
364
times
faster
than
I
should
write
 
<EOS>
It
must
follow
,
an
'
please
your
worships
,
that
the
more
I
write
,
the
more
I
shall
have
to
write
 
and
consequently
,
the
more
your
worships
read
,
the
more
your
worships
will
have
to
read
.
  
<EOS>
Will
this
be
good
for
your
worships
eyes
?
  
<EOS>
It
will
do
well
for
mine
;
and
,
was
it
not
that
my
Opinions
will
be
the
death
of
me
<EOS>
,
I
perceive
I
shall
lead
a
fine
life
of
it
out
of
this
self-
same
life
of
mine
;
or
,
in
other
words
,
shall
lead
a
couple
of
fine
lives
together
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
the
proposal
of
twelve
volumes
a
year
,
or
a
volume
a
month
,
it
no
way
alters
my
prospect
 
<EOS>
write
as
I
will
,
and
rush
as
I
may
into
the
middle
of
things
,
as
Horace
advises
 
I
shall
never
overtake
myself
whipp'd
and
driven
to
the
last
pinch
;
at
the
worst
I
shall
have
one
day
<EOS>
the
start
of
my
pen
 
and
one
day
is
enough
for
two
volumes
 
and
two
volumes
will
be
enough
for
one
year
.
    
<EOS>
Heaven
prosper
the
manufacturers
of
paper
under
this
propitious
reign
,
which
is
now
opened
to
us
 
as
I
trust
its
providence
will
prosper
every
thing
else
in
it
that
is
taken
in
hand
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
the
propagation
of
Geese
 
<EOS>
I
give
myself
no
concern
 
<EOS>
Nature
is
all-
bountiful
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
want
tools
to
work
with
.
    
<EOS>
So
then
,
friend
!
<EOS>
you
have
got
my
father
and
my
uncle
Toby
off
the
stairs
,
and
seen
them
to
bed
?
 
<EOS>
And
how
did
you
manage
it
?
 
<EOS>
You
dropp'd
<EOS>
a
curtain
at
the
stair
-
foot
 
<EOS>
I
thought
you
had
no
other
way
for
it
 
<EOS>
Here
's
a
crown
for
your
trouble
.
      
<EOS>
Then
reach
me
my
breeches
off
the
chair
,
said
my
father
to
Susannah
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
not
a
moment
's
time
to
dress
you
,
Sir
,
cried
Susannah
 
<EOS>
the
child
is
as
black
in
the
face
as
my
 
<EOS>
As
your
what
?
<EOS>
said
my
father
,
for
like
all
orators
,
he
was
a
dear
searcher
into
comparisons
.
 
<EOS>
Bless
,
me
,
Sir
,
said
Susannah
,
the
child
's
in
a
fit
.
 
<EOS>
And
where
's
Mr.
Yorick
?
 
<EOS>
Never
where
he
should
be
,
said
Susannah
,
but
his
curate
's
in
the
dressing
-
room
,
with
the
child
upon
his
arm
,
waiting
for
the
name
 
and
my
mistress
bid
me
run
as
fast
as
I
could
to
know
,
as
captain
Shandy
is
the
godfather
,
whether
it
should
not
be
called
after
him
.
  
<EOS>
Were
one
sure
,
said
my
father
to
himself
,
scratching
his
eye
-
brow
,
that
the
child
was
expiring
<EOS>
,
one
might
as
well
compliment
my
brother
Toby
as
not
  
and
it
would
be
a
pity
,
in
such
a
case
,
to
throw
away
so
great
a
name
as
Trismegistus
upon
him
 
but
he
may
recover
.
  
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
 
said
my
father
to
Susannah
<EOS>
,
I
'll
get
up
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
time
,
cried
Susannah
,
the
child
's
as
black
as
my
shoe
.
 
<EOS>
Trismegistus
,
said
my
father
  
<EOS>
But
stay
 
thou
art
a
leaky
vessel
,
Susannah
,
added
my
father
;
canst
thou
carry
Trismegistus
in
thy
head
,
the
length
of
the
gallery
without
scattering
?
 
<EOS>
Can
I
?
<EOS>
cried
Susannah
,
shutting
the
door
in
a
huff
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
can
,
I
'll
be
shot
,
said
my
father
,
bouncing
out
of
bed
in
the
dark
,
and
groping
for
his
breeches
.
  
<EOS>
Susannah
ran
with
all
speed
along
the
gallery
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
made
all
possible
speed
to
find
his
breeches
.
  
<EOS>
Susannah
got
the
start
,
and
kept
it
 
'
Tis
Tris
 
something
,
cried
Susannah
  
<EOS>
There
is
no
christian
-
name
in
the
world
,
said
the
curate
,
beginning
with
Tris
 
but
Tristram
.
 
<EOS>
Then
'
tis
Tristram
-
gistus
,
quoth
Susannah
.
    
<EOS>
There
is
no
gistus
to
it
,
noodle
!
 
<EOS>
'
tis
my
own
name
,
replied
the
curate
,
dipping
his
hand
,
as
he
spoke
,
into
the
bason
 
Tristram
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
&
c.
&
c.
&
c.
&
c.
 
<EOS>
so
Tristram
was
I
called
,
and
<EOS>
Tristram
shall
I
be
to
the
day
of
my
death
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
followed
Susannah
,
with
his
night
-
gown
across
his
arm
,
with
nothing
more
than
his
breeches
on
,
fastened
through
haste
with
but
a
single
button
,
and
that
button
through
haste
thrust
only
half
into
the
button-
hole
.
    
<EOS>
She
has
not
forgot
the
name
,
cried
my
father
,
<EOS>
half
opening
the
door
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
said
the
curate
,
with
a
tone
of
intelligence
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
child
is
better
,
cried
Susannah
.
 
<EOS>
And
how
does
your
mistress
?
 
<EOS>
As
well
,
said
Susannah
,
as
can
be
expected
.
 
<EOS>
Pish
!
<EOS>
said
my
father
,
the
button
of
his
breeches
slipping
out
of
the
button
-
hole
 
So
that
whether
the
interjection
was
levelled
at
Susannah
,
or
the
button
-
hole
 
whether
Pish
was
an
interjection
of
contempt
or
an
interjection
of
modesty
,
is
a
doubt
,
and
must
be
a
doubt
till
I
shall
have
time
to
write
the
three
following
favourite
chapters
,
that
is
,
my
chapter
of
chamber
-
maids
,
my
chapter
of
pishes
,
and
my
chapter
of
button-
holes
.
  
<EOS>
All
the
light
I
am
able
to
give
the
reader
at
present
is
this
,
that
the
moment
my
father
cried
Pish
!
<EOS>
he
whisk'd
himself
about
 
and
with
his
breeches
held
up
by
one
hand
,
and
his
night
-
gown
thrown
across
the
arm
of
the
other
,
he
turned
along
the
gallery
to
bed
,
something
slower
than
he
came
.
    
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
write
a
chapter
upon
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
A
fitter
occasion
could
never
have
presented
itself
,
than
what
this
moment
offers
,
when
all
the
curtains
of
the
family
are
drawn
 
the
candles
put
out
 
and
no
creature
's
eyes
are
open
but
a
single
one
,
for
the
other
has
been
shut
these
twenty
years
,
of
my
mother
's
nurse
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
a
fine
subject
.
  
<EOS>
And
yet
,
as
fine
as
it
is
,
I
would
undertake
to
write
a
dozen
chapters
upon
button
-
holes
,
both
quicker
and
with
more
fame
,
than
a
single
chapter
upon
this
.
  
<EOS>
Button
-
holes
!
<EOS>
there
is
something
lively
in
the
very
idea
of
'em
 
and
trust
me
,
when
I
get
amongst
'em
 
<EOS>
You
gentry
with
great
beards
 
look
as
grave
as
you
will
 
<EOS>
I
'll
make
merry
work
with
my
button
-
holes
 
<EOS>
I
shall
have
'em
all
to
myself
 
'
tis
<EOS>
a
maiden
subject
 
<EOS>
I
shall
run
foul
of
no
man
's
wisdom
or
fine
sayings
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
But
for
sleep
 
I
know
I
shall
make
nothing
of
it
before
I
begin
 
<EOS>
I
am
no
dab
at
your
fine
sayings
in
the
first
place
 
and
<EOS>
in
the
next
,
I
can
not
for
my
soul
set
a
grave
face
upon
a
bad
matter
,
and
tell
the
world
 
'
tis
the
refuge
of
the
unfortunate
 
the
enfranchisement
of
the
prisoner
 
the
downy
lap
of
the
hopeless
,
the
weary
,
and
the
broken
-
hearted
;
nor
could
I
set
out
with
a
lye
in
my
mouth
,
by
affirming
,
that
of
all
the
soft
and
delicious
functions
of
our
nature
,
by
which
the
great
Author
of
it
,
in
his
bounty
,
has
been
pleased
to
recompence
the
sufferings
wherewith
his
justice
and
his
good
pleasure
has
wearied
us
 
that
this
is
the
chiefest
(
I
know
pleasures
worth
ten
of
it
)
;
or
what
a
happiness
it
is
to
man
,
when
the
anxieties
and
passions
of
the
day
are
over
,
and
he
lies
down
upon
his
back
,
that
his
soul
shall
be
so
seated
within
him
,
that
whichever
way
she
turns
her
eyes
,
the
heavens
shall
look
calm
and
sweet
above
her
 
no
desire
 
or
fear
 
or
doubt
that
troubles
the
air
,
nor
any
difficulty
past
,
present
,
or
to
come
,
that
the
imagination
may
not
pass
over
without
offence
,
in
that
sweet
secession
.

"
God
's
blessing
,
"
said
Sancho
Panca
,
"
be
upon
the
man
who
first
invented
this
self
-
same
thing
called
sleep
 
<EOS>
it
covers
a
man
all
over
like
a
cloak
.
"
 
<EOS>
Now
there
is
more
to
me
in
this
,
and
it
speaks
warmer
to
my
heart
and
affections
,
than
all
the
dissertations
squeez'd
out
of
the
heads
of
the
learned
together
upon
the
subject
.
    
<EOS>
Not
that
I
altogether
disapprove
of
what
Montaigne
advances
upon
it
 
'
tis
admirable
in
its
way
 
(
I
quote
by
memory
.
)
  
<EOS>
The
world
enjoys
other
pleasures
,
says
he
,
as
they
do
that
of
sleep
,
without
tasting
or
feeling
it
as
it
slips
and
passes
by
.
 
<EOS>
We
should
study
and
ruminate
upon
it
,
in
order
to
render
proper
thanks
to
him
who
grants
it
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
For
this
end
I
cause
myself
to
be
disturbed
in
my
sleep
,
that
I
may
the
better
and
more
sensibly
relish
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
I
see
few
,
says
he
again
,
who
live
with
less
sleep
,
when
need
requires
;
my
body
is
capable
of
a
firm
,
but
not
of
a
violent
and
sudden
agitation
 
<EOS>
I
evade
of
late
all
violent
exercises
 
<EOS>
I
am
never
weary
with
walking
 
but
from
my
youth
<EOS>
,
I
never
looked
to
ride
upon
pavements
.
 
<EOS>
I
love
to
lie
hard
and
alone
,
and
even
without
my
wife
 
<EOS>
This
last
word
may
stagger
the
faith
of
the
world
 
but
remember
,
"
La
Vraisemblance
"
(
as
Bayle
says
in
the
affair
of
Liceti
)
<EOS>
"
n'est
pas
toujours
du
Cote
de
la
Verite
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
so
much
for
sleep
.
    
<EOS>
If
my
wife
will
but
venture
him
 
brother
Toby
,
Trismegistus
shall
be
dress'd
and
brought
down
to
us
,
whilst
you
and
I
are
getting
our
breakfasts
together
.
      
<EOS>
Go
,
tell
Susannah
,
Obadiah
,
to
step
here
.
  
<EOS>
She
is
run
up
stairs
,
answered
Obadiah
,
this
very
instant
,
sobbing
and
crying
,
and
wringing
her
hands
as
if
her
heart
would
break
.
  
<EOS>
We
shall
have
a
rare
month
of
it
,
said
my
father
,
turning
his
head
from
Obadiah
,
and
looking
wistfully
in
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
's
face
for
some
time
 
<EOS>
we
shall
have
a
devilish
month
of
it
,
brother
Toby
,
said
my
father
,
setting
his
arms
a'kimbo
,
and
shaking
his
head
;
fire
,
water
,
women
,
wind
 
brother
Toby
!
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
some
misfortune
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
That
it
is
,
cried
my
father
 
to
have
so
many
jarring
elements
breaking
loose
,
and
riding
triumph
in
every
corner
of
a
gentleman
's
house
 
<EOS>
Little
boots
it
to
the
peace
of
a
family
,
brother
Toby
,
that
you
and
I
possess
ourselves
,
and
sit
here
silent
and
unmoved
 
<EOS>
whilst
such
a
storm
is
whistling
over
our
heads
.
    
<EOS>
And
what
's
the
matter
,
Susannah
?
 
<EOS>
They
have
called
the
child
<EOS>
Tristram
 
and
my
mistress
is
just
got
out
of
an
hysterick
fit
about
it
 
<EOS>
No
!
 
<EOS>
'
tis
not
my
fault
<EOS>
,
said
Susannah
 
I
told
him
it
was
Tristram
-
gistus
.
    
<EOS>
Make
tea
for
yourself
,
brother
Toby
,
said
my
father
,
taking
down
his
hat
 
<EOS>
but
how
different
from
the
sallies
and
agitations
of
voice
and
members
which
a
common
reader
would
imagine
!
    
<EOS>
For
he
spake
in
the
sweetest
modulation
 
and
took
down
his
hat
with
the
genteelest
movement
of
limbs
,
that
ever
affliction
harmonized
and
attuned
together
.
    
<EOS>
Go
to
the
bowling
-
green
for
corporal
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
speaking
to
Obadiah
,
as
soon
as
my
father
left
the
room
.
    
<EOS>
When
the
misfortune
of
my
Nose
fell
so
heavily
upon
my
father
's
head
;
 
the
reader
remembers
that
he
walked
instantly
up
stairs
,
and
cast
himself
down
upon
his
bed
;
and
from
hence
,
unless
he
has
a
great
insight
into
human
nature
,
he
will
be
apt
to
expect
a
rotation
of
the
same
ascending
and
descending
movements
from
him
,
upon
this
misfortune
of
my
Name
;
 
no
.
  
<EOS>
The
different
weight
,
dear
Sir
 
nay
even
the
different
package
of
two
vexations
of
the
same
weight
 
makes
a
very
wide
difference
in
our
manner
of
bearing
and
getting
through
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
half
an
hour
ago
,
when
(
in
the
great
hurry
and
precipitation
of
a
poor
devil
's
writing
for
daily
bread
)
I
threw
a
fair
sheet
,
which
I
had
just
finished
,
and
carefully
wrote
out
,
slap
into
the
fire
,
instead
of
the
foul
one
.
  
<EOS>
Instantly
I
snatch'd
off
my
wig
,
and
threw
it
perpendicularly
,
with
all
imaginable
violence
,
up
to
the
top
of
the
room
 
<EOS>
indeed
I
caught
it
as
it
fell
 
<EOS>
but
there
was
an
end
of
the
matter
;
nor
<EOS>
do
I
think
any
think
else
in
Nature
would
have
given
such
immediate
ease
:
 
She
,
dear
Goddess
,
by
an
instantaneous
impulse
,
in
all
provoking
cases
,
determines
us
to
a
sally
of
this
or
that
member
 
or
else
she
thrusts
us
into
this
or
that
place
,
or
posture
of
body
,
we
know
not
why
 
But
mark
,
madam
,
we
live
amongst
riddles
and
mysteries
 
the
most
obvious
things
,
which
come
in
our
way
,
have
dark
sides
,
which
the
quickest
sight
can
not
penetrate
into
;
and
even
the
clearest
and
most
exalted
understandings
amongst
us
find
ourselves
puzzled
and
at
a
loss
in
almost
every
cranny
of
nature
's
works
:
 
so
that
this
,
like
a
thousand
other
things
,
falls
out
for
us
in
a
way
,
which
tho
<EOS>
'
we
can
not
reason
upon
it
 
<EOS>
yet
we
find
the
good
of
it
,
may
it
please
your
reverences
and
your
worships
 
<EOS>
and
that
's
enough
for
us
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
my
father
could
not
lie
down
with
this
affliction
for
his
life
 
nor
could
he
carry
it
up
stairs
like
the
other
 
<EOS>
he
walked
composedly
out
with
it
to
the
fish
-
pond
.
  
<EOS>
Had
my
father
leaned
his
head
upon
his
hand
,
and
reasoned
an
hour
which
way
to
have
gone
 
reason
,
with
all
her
force
,
could
not
have
directed
him
to
any
think
like
it
:
 
there
is
something
,
Sir
,
in
fish
-
ponds
 
<EOS>
but
what
it
is
,
I
leave
to
system
-
builders
and
fish
-
pond
-
diggers
betwixt
'em
to
find
out
  
but
there
is
something
,
under
the
first
disorderly
transport
of
the
humours
,
so
unaccountably
becalming
in
an
orderly
and
a
sober
walk
towards
one
of
them
,
that
I
have
often
wondered
that
neither
Pythagoras
,
nor
Plato
,
nor
Solon
,
nor
Lycurgus
,
nor
Mahomet
,
nor
any
one
of
your
noted
lawgivers
,
ever
gave
order
about
them
.
    
<EOS>
Your
honour
,
said
Trim
,
shutting
the
parlour
-
door
before
he
began
to
speak
,
has
heard
,
I
imagine
,
of
this
unlucky
accident
 
<EOS>
O
<EOS>
yes
,
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
and
it
gives
me
great
concern
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
heartily
concerned
too
,
but
I
hope
your
honour
,
replied
Trim
,
will
do
me
the
justice
to
believe
,
that
it
was
not
in
the
least
owing
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
To
thee
 
<EOS>
Trim
?
 
<EOS>
cried
my
uncle
Toby
,
looking
kindly
in
his
face
 
<EOS>
'
twas
Susannah
's
and
the
curate
's
folly
betwixt
them
.
 
<EOS>
What
business
could
they
have
together
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
in
the
garden
?
 
<EOS>
In
the
gallery
thou
meanest
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
.
  
<EOS>
Trim
found
he
was
upon
a
wrong
scent
,
and
stopped
short
with
a
low
bow
 
Two
misfortunes
,
quoth
the
corporal
to
himself
,
are
twice
as
many
at
least
as
are
needful
to
be
talked
over
at
one
time
;
 
the
mischief
the
cow
has
done
in
breaking
into
the
fortifications
,
may
be
told
his
honour
hereafter
.
  
<EOS>
Trim
's
casuistry
and
address
,
under
the
cover
of
his
low
bow
,
prevented
all
suspicion
in
my
uncle
Toby
,
so
he
went
on
with
what
he
had
to
say
to
Trim
as
follows
:
    
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
Trim
,
though
I
can
see
<EOS>
little
or
no
difference
betwixt
<EOS>
my
nephew
's
being
called
Tristram
or
Trismegistus
 
yet
as
the
thing
sits
so
near
my
brother
's
heart
,
Trim
 
<EOS>
I
would
freely
have
given
a
hundred
pounds
rather
than
it
should
have
happened
.
 
<EOS>
A
hundred
pounds
,
an
'
please
your
honour
!
<EOS>
replied
Trim
,
 
I
would
not
give
a
cherry
-
stone
to
boot
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
would
I
,
Trim
,
upon
my
own
account
,
<EOS>
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
 
<EOS>
but
my
brother
,
whom
there
is
no
arguing
with
in
this
case
 
maintains
that
a
great
deal
more
depends
,
Trim
,
upon
christian
-
names
,
than
what
ignorant
people
imagine
 
<EOS>
for
he
says
there
never
was
a
great
or
heroic
action
performed
since
the
world
began
by
one
called
Tristram
 
nay
,
he
will
have
it
,
Trim
,
that
a
man
can
neither
be
learned
,
or
wise
,
or
brave
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
all
fancy
,
an
'
please
your
honour
 
<EOS>
I
fought
just
as
well
,
replied
the
corporal
,
when
the
regiment
called
me
Trim
,
as
when
they
called
me
James
Butler
.
 
<EOS>
And
for
my
own
part
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
though
I
should
blush
to
boast
of
myself
,
Trim
 
yet
<EOS>
had
my
name
been
Alexander
<EOS>
,
I
could
have
done
no
more
at
Namur
than
my
duty
.
  
<EOS>
Bless
your
honour
!
<EOS>
cried
Trim
,
advancing
three
steps
as
he
spoke
<EOS>
,
does
a
man
think
of
his
christian
-
name
when
he
goes
upon
the
attack
?
 
<EOS>
Or
when
he
stands
in
the
trench
,
Trim
?
<EOS>
cried
my
uncle
Toby
,
looking
firm
.
 
<EOS>
Or
when
he
enters
a
breach
?
<EOS>
said
Trim
,
pushing
in
between
two
chairs
.
 
<EOS>
Or
forces
the
lines
?
<EOS>
cried
my
uncle
,
rising
up
,
and
pushing
his
crutch
like
a
pike
.
 
<EOS>
Or
facing
a
platoon
?
<EOS>
cried
Trim
,
presenting
his
stick
like
a
firelock
.
 
<EOS>
Or
when
he
marches
up
the
glacis
?
<EOS>
cried
my
uncle
Toby
,
looking
warm
and
setting
his
foot
upon
his
stool
.
      
<EOS>
My
father
was
returned
from
his
walk
to
the
fish
-
pond
 
and
opened
the
parlour
-
door
in
the
very
height
of
the
attack
,
just
as
my
uncle
Toby
was
marching
up
the
glacis
 
<EOS>
Trim
recovered
his
arms
 
<EOS>
never
was
my
uncle
Toby
caught
in
riding
at
such
a
desperate
rate
in
his
life
!
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
!
<EOS>
had
not
a
weightier
matter
called
forth
all
the
ready
eloquence
of
my
father
 
<EOS>
how
hadst
thou
then
and
thy
poor
Hobby
-
Horse
too
been
insulted
!
  
<EOS>
My
father
hung
up
his
hat
with
the
same
air
he
took
it
down
;
and
after
giving
a
slight
look
at
the
disorder
of
the
room
,
he
took
hold
of
one
of
the
chairs
which
had
formed
the
corporal
's
breach
,
and
placing
it
over-
against
my
uncle
Toby
,
he
sat
down
in
it
,
and
as
soon
as
the
tea
-
things
were
taken
away
,
and
the
door
shut
,
he
broke
out
in
a
lamentation
as
follows
:
  
<EOS>
My
Father
's
Lamentation
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
in
vain
longer
,
said
my
father
,
addressing
himself
as
much
to
Ernulphus
's
curse
,
which
was
laid
upon
the
corner
of
the
chimney
-
piece
 
as
to
my
uncle
Toby
who
sat
under
it
 
it
is
in
vain
longer
,
said
my
father
,
in
the
most
querulous
monotony
imaginable
,
to
struggle
as
I
have
done
against
this
most
uncomfortable
of
human
persuasions
 
<EOS>
I
see
it
plainly
,
that
either
for
my
own
sins
,
brother
Toby
,
or
the
sins
and
follies
of
the
Shandy
family
,
Heaven
has
thought
fit
to
draw
forth
the
heaviest
of
its
artillery
against
me
;
and
that
the
prosperity
of
my
child
is
the
point
upon
which
the
whole
force
of
it
is
directed
to
play
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
thing
would
batter
the
whole
universe
about
our
ears
,
brother
Shandy
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
 
if
it
was
so-
<EOS>
Unhappy
Tristram
!
<EOS>
child
of
wrath
!
<EOS>
child
of
decrepitude
!
<EOS>
interruption
!
<EOS>
mistake
!
<EOS>
and
discontent
!
 
<EOS>
What
one
misfortune
or
disaster
in
the
book
of
embryotic
evils
,
that
could
unmechanize
thy
frame
,
or
entangle
thy
filaments
!
<EOS>
which
has
not

what
evils
in
thy
passage
into

<EOS>
what
evils
since

<EOS>
produced
into
being
,
in
the
decline
of
thy
father
's
days
 
when
the
powers
of
his
imagination
and
of
his
body
were
waxing
feeble
 
<EOS>
when
radical
heat
and
radical
moisture
,
the
elements
which
should
have
temper'd
thine

were
drying
up

and
nothing
left

thy

brother
Toby
,
at
the
best
,
and
called
out
for
all
the
little
helps
that
care
and
attention
on
both
sides
could
give
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
how
were
we
defeated
!
 
<EOS>
You
know
the
event
,
<EOS>
brother
Toby
 
<EOS>
'
tis
too
melancholy
a
one
to
be
repeated
now
 
when
the
few
animal
spirits
I
was
worth
in
the
world
,
and
with
which
memory
,
fancy
,
and
quick
parts
should
have
been
convey'd
 
<EOS>
were
all
dispersed
,
confused
,
confounded
,
scattered
,
and
sent
to
the
devil
.
    
<EOS>
Here
then
was
the
time
to
have
put
a
stop
to
this
persecution
against
him
;
 
and
tried
an
experiment
at
least
 
whether
calmness
and
serenity
of
mind
in
your
sister
,
with
a
due
attention
,
brother
Toby
,
to
her
evacuations
and
repletions
 
and
the
rest
of
her
non
-
naturals
,
might
not
,
in
a
course
of
nine
months
gestation
,
have
set
all
things
to
rights
.
 
<EOS>
My
child
was
bereft
of
these
!
 
<EOS>
What
a
teazing
life
did
she
lead
herself
,
and
consequently
her
foetus
too
,
with
that
nonsensical
anxiety
of
hers
about
lying
-
in
in
town
?
 
<EOS>
I
thought
my
sister
submitted
with
the
greatest
patience
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
I
never
heard
her
utter
one
fretful
word
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
fumed
inwardly
,
cried
my
father
;
and
that
,
let
me
tell
you
,
brother
,
was
ten
times
worse
for
the
child
 
<EOS>
and
then
!
<EOS>
what
battles
did
she
fight
with
me
,
and
what
perpetual
storms
about
the
midwife
.
 
<EOS>
There
she
gave
vent
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
Vent
!
<EOS>
cried
my
father
,
looking
up
.
  
<EOS>
But
what
was
all
this
,
my
dear
Toby
,
to
the
injuries
<EOS>
done
us
by
my
child
's
coming
head
foremost
into
the
world
,
when
all
I
wished
,
in
this
general
wreck
of
his
frame
,
was
to
have
saved
this
little
casket
unbroke
,
unrifled
.
    
<EOS>
With
all
my
precautions
,
how
was
my
system
turned
topside
-
turvy
in
the
womb
with
my
child
!
<EOS>
his
head
exposed
to
the
hand
of
violence
,
and
a
pressure
of
470
pounds
avoirdupois
weight
acting
so
perpendicularly
upon
its
apex
 
that
at
this
hour
'
tis
ninety

,
that
the
fine
net

work
of
the
intellectual

be
not

and
torn
to
a
thousand

<EOS>
Still
we
could
have
done

<EOS>
Fool

,

give
him
but
a
Nose
  
Cripple
,
Dwarf

Driveller
,

(
shape
him
as
you
will
)
the
door
of
fortune
stands
open
 
O
Licetus
!
<EOS>
Licetus
!
<EOS>
had
I
been
blest
with
a
foetus
five
inches
long
and
a
half
,
like
thee
 
Fate
might
have
done
her
worst
.
  
<EOS>
Still
,
brother
Toby
,
there
was
one
cast
of
the
dye
left
for
our
child
after
all
 
<EOS>
O
Tristram
!
<EOS>
Tristram
!
<EOS>
Tristram
!
  
<EOS>
We
will
send
for
Mr.
Yorick
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
    
<EOS>
You
may
send
for
whom
you
will
,
replied
my
father
.
    
<EOS>
What
a
rate
have
I
gone
on
at
,
curvetting
and
striking
it
away
,
two
up
and
two
down
for
three
volumes
(
According
to
the
preceding
Editions

)
<EOS>
together
,
without
looking
once
behind
,
or
even
on
one
side
of
me
,
to
see
whom
I
trod
upon
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
tread
upon
no
one
 
<EOS>
quoth
I
to
myself
<EOS>
when
I
mounted
 
I
'll
take
a
good
rattling
gallop
;
but
I
'll
not
hurt
the
poorest
jack
-
ass
upon
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
So
off
I
set
 
up
one
lane
 
down
another
,
through
this
turnpike
 
over
that
,
as
if
the
arch
-
jockey
of
jockeys
had
got
behind
me
.
  
<EOS>
Now
ride
at
this
rate
with
what
good
intention
and
resolution
<EOS>
you
may
 
'

a

do
some

a
mischief

He

<EOS>
he

off
 
<EOS>

<EOS>
he

down
 
<EOS>
he

break

<EOS>
if
he
has
not
galloped
full
among
the
scaffolding
of
the
undertaking
criticks
!
 
<EOS>
he
'll
knock
his
brains
out
against
some
of
their
posts
 
<EOS>
he
's
bounced
out
!
 
<EOS>
look
 
<EOS>
he
's
now
riding
like
a
mad

cap
full
tilt
through
a
whole
crowd
of

<EOS>
Do

said
I
 
<EOS>
I
'll
not
hurt
the
poorest
jack

ass
upon
the
king

highway
.
 
<EOS>
But
your

a

<EOS>
I
hope
in
God

said
I.

Le

De

De

doctors

<EOS>
That

replied
I.
 
<EOS>
But
you
have
trod
this
moment
upon
a
king

<EOS>
Kings
have
bad
times
on't

said
I
,
to
be
trod
upon
by
such
people
as
me
.
  
<EOS>
You
have
done
it
,
replied
my
accuser
.
  
<EOS>
I
deny
it
,
quoth
I
,
and
so
have
got
off
,
and
here
am
I
standing
with
my
bridle
in
one
hand
,
and
with
my
cap
in
the
other
,
to
tell
my
story
.
 
<EOS>
And
what
in
it
?
 
<EOS>
You
shall
hear
in
the
next
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
As
Francis
the
first
of
France
was
one
winterly
night
warming
himself
over
the
embers
of
a
wood
fire
,
and
talking
with
his
first
minister
of
sundry
things
for
the
good
of
the
state
<EOS>
(
Vide
Menagiana
,
Vol
.
<EOS>
I.
)
 
<EOS>
It
would
not
be
amiss
,
said
the
king
,
stirring
up
the
embers
with
his
cane
,
if
this
good
understanding
betwixt
ourselves
and
Switzerland
<EOS>
was
a
little
strengthened
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
end
,
Sire
,
replied
the
minister
,
in
giving
money
to
these
people
 
they
would
swallow
up
the
treasury
of
France
.
 
<EOS>
Poo
!
<EOS>
poo
!
<EOS>
answered
the
king
 
<EOS>
there
are
more
ways
,
Mons
.
<EOS>
le
Premier
,
of
bribing
states
,
besides
that
of
giving
money
 
I
'll
pay
Switzerland
the
honour
of
standing
godfather
for
my
next
child
.
 
<EOS>
Your
majesty
,
said
the
minister
,
in
so
doing
,
would
have
all
the
grammarians
in
Europe
upon
your
back
;
 
Switzerland
,
as
a
republic
,
being
a
female
,
can
in
no
construction
be
godfather
.
 
<EOS>
She
may
be
godmother
,
replied
Francis
hastily
 
<EOS>
so
announce
my
intentions
by
a
courier
to
-
morrow
morning
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
astonished
,
said
Francis
the
First
,
(
that
day
fortnight
)
speaking
to
his
minister
as
he
entered
the
closet
,
that
we
have
had
no
answer
from
Switzerland
.
 
<EOS>
Sire
,
I
wait
upon
you
this
moment
,
said
Mons
.
<EOS>
le
Premier
,
to
lay
before
you
my
dispatches
upon
that
business
.
 
<EOS>
They
take
it
kindly
,
said
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
They
do
,
Sire
,
replied
the
minister
,
and
have
the
highest
sense
of
the
honour
your
majesty
has
done
them
 
but
the
republick
,
as
godmother
,
claims
her
right
,
in
this
case
,
of
naming
the
child
.
  
<EOS>
In
all
reason
,
quoth
the
king
 
<EOS>
she
will
christen
him
Francis
,
or
Henry
,
or
Lewis
,
or
some
name
that
she
knows
will
be
agreeable
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
Your
majesty
is
deceived
,
replied
the
minister
 
<EOS>
I
have
this
hour
received
a
dispatch
from
our
resident
,
with
the
determination
of
the
republic
on
that
point
also
.
 
<EOS>
And
what
name
has
the
republick
fixed
upon
for
the
Dauphin
?
  
<EOS>
Shadrach
,
Mesech
,
Abed
-
nego
,
replied
the
minister
.
 
<EOS>
By
Saint
Peter
's
girdle
,
I
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
Swiss
,
cried
Francis
the
First
,
pulling
up
his
breeches
and
walking
hastily
across
the
floor
.
  
<EOS>
Your
majesty
,
replied
the
minister
calmly
,
can
not
bring
yourself
off
.
  
<EOS>
We
'll
pay
them
in
money
 
<EOS>
said
the
king
.
  
<EOS>
Sire
,
there
are
not
sixty
thousand
crowns
in
the
treasury
,
answered
the
minister
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
pawn
the
best
jewel
in
my
crown
,
quoth
Francis
the
First
.
  
<EOS>
Your
honour
stands
pawn'd
already
in
this
matter
,
answered
Monsieur
le
Premier
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
Mons
.
<EOS>
le
Premier
,
said
the
king
,
by
.
.
<EOS>
.we'll
go
to
war
with
'em
.
    
<EOS>
Albeit
,
gentle
reader
,
I
have
lusted
earnestly
,
and
endeavoured
carefully
(
according
to
the
measure
of
such
a
slender
skill
as
God
has
vouchsafed
me
,
and
as
convenient
leisure
from
other
occasions
of
needful
profit
and
healthful
pastime
have
permitted
)
that
these
little
books
which
I
here
put
into
thy
hands
,
might
stand
instead
of
many
bigger
books
 
yet
<EOS>
have
I
carried
myself
towards
thee
in
such
fanciful
guise
of
careless
disport
,
that
right
sore
am
I
ashamed
now
to
intreat
thy
lenity
seriously
 
in
beseeching
thee
to
believe
it
of
me
,
that
in
the
story
of
my
father
and
his
christian
-
names
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
thoughts
of
treading
upon
Francis
<EOS>
the
First
 
nor
in
the
affair
of
the
nose
 
upon
Francis
<EOS>
the
Ninth
 
nor
in
the
character
of
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
 
of
characterizing
the
militiating
spirits
of
my
country
 
the
wound
upon
his
groin
,
is
a
wound
to
every
comparison
of
that
kind
 
nor
by
Trim
 
that
I
meant
the
duke
of
Ormond
 
or
that
my
book
is
wrote
against
predestination
,
or
free
-
will
,
or
taxes
 
<EOS>
If
'
tis
wrote
against
any
thing
,
  
'
tis
wrote
,
an
'
please
your
worships
,
against
the
spleen
!
<EOS>
in
order
,
by
a
more
frequent
and
a
more
convulsive
elevation
and
depression
of
the
diaphragm
,
and
the
succussations
of
the
intercostal
and
abdominal
muscles
in
laughter
,
to
drive
the
gall
and
other
bitter
juices
from
the
gall-
bladder
,
liver
,
and
sweet
-
bread
of
his
majesty
's
subjects
,
with
all
the
inimicitious
passions
which
belong
to
them
,
down
into
their
duodenums
.
      
<EOS>
But
can
the
thing
be
undone
,
Yorick
?
<EOS>
said
my
father
 
for
in
my
opinion
,
continued
he
,
it
can
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
a
vile
canonist
,
replied
Yorick
 
but
of
all
evils
,
holding
suspence
to
be
the
most
tormenting
,
we
shall
at
least
know
the
worst
of
this
matter
.
 
<EOS>
I
hate
these
great
dinners
 
<EOS>
said
my
father
 
<EOS>
The
size
of
the
dinner
is
not
the
point
,
answered
<EOS>
Yorick
 
<EOS>
we
want
,
Mr.
Shandy
,
to
dive
into
the
bottom
of
this
doubt
,
whether
the
name
can
be
changed
or
not
 
and
as
the
beards
of
so
many
commissaries
,
officials
,
advocates
,
proctors
,
registers
,
and
of
the
most
eminent
of
our
school
-
divines
,
and
others
,
are
all
to
meet
in
the
middle
of
one
table
,
and
Didius
has
so
pressingly
invited
you
 
who
in
your
distress
would
miss
such
an
occasion
?
 
<EOS>
All
that
is
requisite
,
continued
Yorick
,
is
to
apprize
Didius
,
and
let
him
manage
a
conversation
after
dinner
so
as
to
introduce
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
Then
my
brother
Toby
,
cried
my
father
,
clapping
his
two
hands
together
,
shall
go
with
us
.
    
<EOS>
Let
my
old
tye
-
wig
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
and
my
laced
regimentals

be
hung

(

<EOS>
No
doubt
,
Sir
,
 
there
is
a
whole
chapter
wanting
here
 
and
<EOS>
a
chasm
of
ten
pages
made
in
the
book
by
it
 
but
the
book
-
binder
is
neither
a
fool
,
or
a
knave
,
or
a
puppy
 
nor
is
the
book
a
jot
<EOS>
more
imperfect
(
at
least
upon
that
score
)
 
<EOS>
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
the
book
is
more
perfect
and
complete
by
wanting
the
chapter
,
than
having
it
,
as
I
shall
demonstrate
to
your
reverences
in
this
manner
.
 
<EOS>
I
question
first
,
by
-
the
-
bye
,
whether
the
same
experiment
might
not
be
made
as
successfully
upon
sundry
other
chapters
  
but
there
is
no
end
,
an
'
please
your
reverences
,
in
trying
experiments
upon
chapters
 
we
have
had
enough
of
it
 
<EOS>
So
there
's
an
end
of
that
matter
.
  
<EOS>
But
before
I
begin
my
demonstration
,
let
me
only
tell
you
,
that
the
chapter
which
I
have
torn
out
,
and
which
otherwise
you
would
all
have
been
reading
just
now
,
instead
of
this
 
was
the
description
of
my
father
's
,
my
uncle
Toby
's
,
Trim
's
,
and
Obadiah
's
setting
out
and
journeying
to
the
visitation
at

<EOS>
..
  
<EOS>
We
'll
go
in
the
coach
,
said
my
father
 
Prithee
,
have
the
arms
been
altered
,
Obadiah
?
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
made
my
story
much
better
to
have
begun
with
telling
you
,
that
at
the
time
my
mother
's
arms
were
added
to
the
Shandy
's
,
when
the
coach
was

painted
upon
my
father
's
marriage
,
it
had
so
fallen
out
that
the
coach
-
painter
,
whether
by
performing
all
his
works
with
the
left
hand
,
like
Turpilius
the
Roman
,
or
Hans
Holbein
of
Basil
 
or
whether
'
twas
more
from
the
blunder
of
his
head
than
hand
 
or
whether
,
lastly
,
it
was
from
the
sinister
turn
which
every
thing
relating
to
our
family
was
apt
to
take
 
<EOS>
it
so
fell
out
,
however
,
to
our
reproach
,
that
instead
of
the
bend
-
dexter
,
which
since
Harry
the
Eighth
's
reign
was
honestly
our
due
 
a
bend
-
sinister
,
by
some
of
these
fatalities
,
had
been
drawn
quite
across
the
field
of
the
Shandy
arms
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
scarce
credible
that
the
mind
of
so
wise
a
man
as
my
father
was
,
could
be
so
much
incommoded
with
so
small
a
matter
.
 
<EOS>
The
word
coach
 
let
it
be
whose
it
would
 
or
coach
-
man
,
or
coach
-
horse
,
or
coach
-
hire
,
could
never
be
named
in
the
family
,
but
he
constantly
complained
of
carrying
this
vile
mark
of
illegitimacy
upon
the
door
of
his
own
;
he
never
once
was
able
to
step
into
the
coach
,
or
out
of
it
,
without
turning
round
to
take
a
view
of
the
arms
,
and
making
a
vow
at
the
same
time
,
that
it
was
the
last
time
he
would
ever
set
his
foot
in
it
again
,
till
the
bend
-
sinister
was
taken
out
 
but
like
the
affair
of
the
hinge
<EOS>
,
it
was
one
of
the
many
things
which
the
Destinies
had
set
down
in
their
books
ever
to
be
grumbled
at
(
and
in
wiser
families
than
ours
)
 
but
never
to
be
mended
.
    
<EOS>
Has
the
bend
-
sinister
been
brush'd
out
<EOS>
,
I
say
?
<EOS>
said
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
There
has
been
nothing
brush'd
out
,
Sir
,
answered
Obadiah
,
but
the
lining
.
 
<EOS>
We
'll
go
o'horseback
,
said
my
father
,
turning
to
Yorick
 
<EOS>
Of
all
things
in
the
world
,
except
politicks
,
the
clergy
know
the
least
of
heraldry
,
said
Yorick
.
 
<EOS>
No
matter
for
that
,
cried
my
father
 
<EOS>
I
should
be
sorry
to
appear
with
a
blot
in
my
escutcheon
before
them
.
 
<EOS>
Never
mind
the
bend
-
sinister
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
putting
on
his
tye
-
wig
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
indeed
,
said
my
father
 
<EOS>
you
may
go
with
my
aunt
Dinah
to
a
visitation
with
a
bend
-
sinister
,
if
you
think
fit
 
<EOS>
My
poor
uncle
Toby
<EOS>
blush'd
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
was
vexed
at
himself
.
 
<EOS>
No
 
my
dear
brother
Toby
,
said
my
father
,
changing
his
tone
 
but
the
damp
of
the
coach-
lining
about
my
loins
,
may
give
me
the
sciatica
again
,
as
it
did
December
,
January
,
and
February
<EOS>
last
winter
 
<EOS>
so
if
you
please
you
shall
ride
my
wife
's
pad
 
<EOS>
and
as
you
are
to
preach
,
Yorick
,
you
had
better
make
the
best
of
your
way
before
 
and
leave
me
to
take
care
of
my
brother
Toby
,
and
to
follow
at
our
own
rates
.
  
<EOS>
Now
the
chapter
I
was
obliged
to
tear
out
,
was
the
description
of
this
cavalcade
,
in
which
Corporal
Trim
and
Obadiah
,
upon
two
coach
-
horses
a-
breast
,
led
the
way
as
slow
as
a
patrole
 
<EOS>
whilst
my
uncle
Toby
,
in
his
laced
regimentals
and
tye
-
wig
,
kept
his
rank
with
my
father
,
in
deep
roads
and
dissertations
alternately
upon
the
advantage
of
learning
and
arms
,
as
each
could
get
the
start
.
    
<EOS>
But
the
painting
of
this
journey
,
upon
reviewing
it
,
appears
to
be
so
much
above
the
stile
and
manner
of
any
thing
else
I
have
been
able
to
paint
in
this
book
,
that
it
could
not
have
remained
in
it
,
without
depreciating
every
other
scene
;
and
destroying
at
the
same
time
that
necessary
equipoise
and
balance
,
(
whether
of
good
or
bad
)
<EOS>
betwixt
chapter
and
chapter
,
from
whence
the
just
proportions
and
harmony
of
the
whole
work
results
.
 
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
am
but
just
set
up
in
the
business
,
so
know
little
about
it
  
<EOS>
but
,
in
my
opinion
,
to
write
a
book
is
for
all
the
world
like
humming
a
song
 
<EOS>
be
but
in
tune
with
yourself
,
madam
,
'
<EOS>
tis
no
matter
how
high
or
how
low
you
take
it
.
    
<EOS>
This
is
the
reason
,
<EOS>
may
it
please
your
reverences
,
that
some
of
the
lowest
and
flattest
compositions
pass
off
very
well
 
(
as
Yorick
told
my
uncle
Toby
one
night
)
by
siege
.
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
looked
brisk
at
the
sound
of
the
word
siege
,
but
could
make
neither
head
or
tail
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
'm
to
preach
at
court
next
Sunday
,
said
Homenas
 
run
over
my
notes
 
<EOS>
so
I
humm'd
over
doctor
Homenas
's
notes
 
<EOS>
the
modulation
's
very
well
 
<EOS>
'
twill
do
,
Homenas
,
if
it
holds
on
at
this
rate
 
so
on
I
<EOS>
humm'd
 
and
<EOS>
a
tolerable
tune
I
thought
it
was
;
and
to
this
hour
,
may
it
please
your
reverences
,
had
never
found
out
how
low
,
how
flat
,
how
spiritless
and
jejune
it
was
,
but
that
all
of
a
sudden
,
up
started
an
air
in
the
middle
of
it
,
so
fine
<EOS>
,
so
rich
,
so
heavenly
,
 
it
carried
my
soul
up
with
it
into
the
other
world
;
now
had
I
(
as
Montaigne
complained
in
a
parallel
accident
)
 
<EOS>
had
I
found
the
declivity
easy
,
or
the
ascent
accessible
 
<EOS>
certes
I
had
been
outwitted
.
  
<EOS>
Your
notes
,
Homenas
,
I
should
have
said
,
are
good
notes
;
 
but
it
was
so
perpendicular
a
precipice
 
so
wholly
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
work
,
that
by
the
first
note
I
humm'd
I
found
myself
flying
into
the
other
world
,
and
from
thence
discovered
the
vale
from
whence
<EOS>
I
came
,
<EOS>
so
deep
,
so
low
,
and
dismal
,
that
I
shall
never
have
the
heart
to
descend
into
it
again
.

<EOS>
A
dwarf
who
brings
a
standard
along
with
him
to
measure
his
own
size
  
take
my
word
,
is
a
dwarf
in
more
articles
than
one
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
much
for
tearing
out
of
chapters
.
      
<EOS>
See
if
he
is
not
cutting
it
into
slips
,
and
giving
them
about
him
to
light
their
pipes
!
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
abominable
,
answered
Didius
;
it
should
not
go
unnoticed
,
said
doctor
Kysarcius--
<EOS>
>
<EOS>
he
was
of
the
Kysarcii
of
the
Low
Countries
.
  
<EOS>
Methinks
,
said
Didius
,
half
rising
from
his
chair
,
in
order
to
remove
a
bottle
and
a
tall
decanter
,
which
stood
in
a
direct
line
betwixt
him
and
<EOS>
Yorick
 
<EOS>
you
might
have
spared
this
sarcastic
stroke
,
and
have
hit
upon
a
more
proper
place
,
<EOS>
Mr.
Yorick
 
or
at
least
upon
a
more
proper
occasion
to
have
shewn
your
contempt
of
what
we
have
been
about
:
 
If
the
sermon
is
of
no
better
worth
than
to
light
pipes
with
 
'
twas
certainly
,
Sir
,
not
good
enough
to
be
preached
before
<EOS>
so
learned
a
body
;
and
if
'
twas
good
enough
to
be
preached
before
so
learned
a
body
 
'
<EOS>
twas
certainly
<EOS>
Sir
,
too
good
to
light
their
pipes
with
afterwards
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
got
him
fast
hung
up
,
quoth
Didius
to
himself
,
<EOS>
upon
one
of
the
two
horns
of
my
dilemma
 
let
him
get
off
as
he
can
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
undergone
such
unspeakable
torments
,
in
bringing
forth
this
sermon
,
quoth
Yorick
,
upon
this
occasion
 
that
I
declare
,
Didius
<EOS>
,
I
would
suffer
martyrdom
 
and
if
it
was
possible
my
horse
with
me
,
a
thousand
times
over
,
before
I
would
sit
down
and
make
such
another
:
 
<EOS>
I
was
delivered
of
it
at
the
wrong
end
of
me
 
<EOS>
it
came
from
my
head
instead
of
my
heart
 
<EOS>
and
it
is
for
the
pain
it
gave
me
,
both
in
the
writing
and
preaching
of
it
,
that
I
revenge
myself
of
it
,
in
this
manner
 
To
preach
<EOS>
,
to
shew
the
extent
of
our
reading
,
or
the
subtleties
of
our
wit
 
to
parade
in
the
eyes
of
the
vulgar
with
the
beggarly
accounts
of
a
little
learning
,
tinsel'd
over
with
a
few
words
which
glitter
,
but
convey
little
light
and
less
warmth
 
is
a
dishonest
use
of
the
poor
single
half
hour
in
a
week
which
is
put
into
our
hands
 
'
Tis
not
preaching
the
gospel
 
but
ourselves
 
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
continued
Yorick
,
I
had
rather
direct
five
words
point
-
blank
to
the
heart
.
    
<EOS>
As
Yorick
pronounced
the
word
point
-
blank
,
my
uncle
Toby
rose
up
to
say
something
upon
projectiles
 
when
a
single
word
and
no
more
uttered
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
drew
every
one
's
ears
towards
it
 
a
word
of
all
others
in
the
dictionary
the
last
in
that
place
to
be
expected
 
<EOS>
a
word
I
am
ashamed
to
write
 
yet
must
be
written
 
must
be
read
 
<EOS>
illegal
 
uncanonical
  
guess
ten
thousand
guesses
,
multiplied
into
themselves
 
rack
 
torture
your
invention
for
ever
<EOS>
,
you
're
where
you
was
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
I
'll
tell
it
in
the
next
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
Zounds
!
 
<EOS>
Z
...
ds
!
<EOS>
cried
Phutatorius
,
partly
to
himself
 
and
yet
high
enough
to
be
heard
 
and
what
seemed
odd
,
'
twas
uttered
in
a
construction
of
look
,
and
in
a
tone
of
voice
,
somewhat
between
that
of
a
man
in
amazement
and
one
in
bodily
pain
.
  
<EOS>
One
or
two
who
had
very
nice
ears
,
and
could
distinguish
the
expression
and
mixture
of
the
two
tones
as
plainly
as
a
third
or
a
fifth
,
or
any
other
chord
in
musick
 
were
the
most
puzzled
and
perplexed
with
it
 
<EOS>
the
concord
was
good
in
itself
 
<EOS>
but
then
'
twas
quite
out
of
the
key
,
and
no
way
applicable
to
the
subject
started
;
 
so
that
with
all
their
knowledge
,
they
could
not
tell
what
in
the
world
to
make
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Others
who
knew
nothing
of
musical
expression
,
and
merely
lent
their
ears
to
the
plain
import
of
the
word
,
imagined
that
Phutatorius
,
who
was
somewhat
of
a
cholerick
spirit
,
was
just
going
to
snatch
the
cudgels
out
of
Didius
's
hands
,
in
order
to
bemaul
Yorick
to
some
purpose
 
and
that
the
desperate
monosyllable
Z
...
ds
was
the
exordium
to
an
oration
,
which
,
as
they
judged
from
the
sample
,
presaged
but
a
rough
kind
of
handling
of
him
;
so
that
my
uncle
Toby
's
good
-
nature
felt
a
pang
for
what
Yorick
was
about
to
undergo
.
 
<EOS>
But
seeing
Phutatorius
stop
short
,
without
any
attempt
or
desire
to
go
on
 
a
third
party
began
to
suppose
,
that
it
was
no
more
than
an
involuntary
respiration
,
casually
forming
itself
into
the
shape
of
a
twelve
-
penny
oath
 
without
the
sin
or
substance
of
one
.
  
<EOS>
Others
,
and
especially
one
or
two
who
sat
next
him
,
looked
upon
it
on
the
contrary
as
a
real
and
substantial
oath
,
propensly
formed
against
Yorick
,
to
whom
he
was
known
to
bear
no
good
liking
 
which
said
oath
,
as
my
father
philosophized
upon
it
,
actually
lay
fretting
and
fuming
at
that
very
time
in
the
upper
regions
of
Phutatorius
's
purtenance
;
and
so
was
naturally
,
and
according
to
the
due
course
of
things
,
first
squeezed
out
by
the
sudden
influx
of
blood
which
was
driven
into
the
right
ventricle
of
Phutatorius
's
heart
,
by
the
stroke
of
surprize
which
so
strange
a
theory
of
preaching
had
excited
.
  
<EOS>
How
finely
we
argue
upon
mistaken
facts
!
  
<EOS>
There
was
not
a
soul
busied
in
all
these
various
reasonings
upon
the
monosyllable
which
Phutatorius
uttered
 
who
did
not
take
this
for
granted
,
proceeding
upon
it
as
from
an
axiom
,
namely
,
that
Phutatorius
's
mind
was
intent
upon
the
subject
of
debate
which
was
arising
between
Didius
and
Yorick
;
and
indeed
as
he
looked
first
towards
the
one
and
then
towards
the
other
,
with
the
air
of
a
man
listening
to
what
was
going
forwards
 
who
would
not
have
thought
the
same
?
 
<EOS>
But
the
truth
was
,
that
Phutatorius
knew
not
one
word
or
one
syllable
of
what
was
passing
 
but
his
whole
thoughts
and
attention
were
taken
up
with
a
transaction
which
was
going
forwards
at
that
very
instant
within
the
precincts
of
his
own
Galligaskins
,
and
in
a
part
of
them
,
where
of
all
others
he
stood
most
interested
to
watch
accidents
:
 
So
that
notwithstanding
he
looked
with
all
the
attention
in
the
world
,
and
had
gradually
skrewed
up
every
nerve
and
muscle
in
his
face
,
to
the
utmost
pitch
the
instrument
would
bear
,
in
order
,
as
it
was
thought
,
to
give
a
sharp
reply
to
Yorick
,
who
sat
over
-
against
him
 
yet
<EOS>
,
I
say
,
was
Yorick
never
once
in
any
one
domicile
of
Phutatorius
's
brain
 
but
<EOS>
the
true
cause
of
his
exclamation
lay
at
least
a
yard
below
.
   
<EOS>
This
I
will
endeavour
to
explain
to
you
with
all
imaginable
decency
.
  
<EOS>
You
must
be
informed
then
,
that
Gastripheres
,
who
had
taken
a
turn
into
the
kitchen
a
little
before
dinner
,
to
see
how
things
went
on
 
observing
a
wicker
-
basket
of
fine
chesnuts
standing
upon
the
dresser
,
had
ordered
that
a
hundred
or
two
of
them
might
be
roasted
and
sent
in
,
as
soon
as
dinner
was
over
 
Gastripheres
inforcing
his
orders
about
them
,
that
Didius
,
but
Phutatorius
<EOS>
especially
,
were
particularly
fond
of
'em
.
  
<EOS>
About
two
minutes
before
the
time
that
my
uncle
Toby
interrupted
Yorick
's
harangue
 
Gastripheres
's
chesnuts
were
brought
in
 
and
as
Phutatorius
's
fondness
for
'em
was
uppermost
in
the
waiter
's
head
,
he
laid
them
directly
before
Phutatorius
,
wrapt
up
hot
in
a
clean
damask
napkin
.
  
<EOS>
Now
whether
it
was
physically
impossible
,
with
half
a
dozen
hands
all
thrust
into
the
napkin
at
a
time
 
but
that
some
one
chesnut
,
of
more
life
and
rotundity
than
the
rest
,
must
be
put
in
motion
 
<EOS>
it
so
fell
out
,
however
,
that
one
was
actually
sent
rolling
off
the
table
;
and
as
Phutatorius
sat
straddling
under
 
it
fell
perpendicularly
into
that
particular
aperture
of
Phutatorius
's
breeches
,
for
which
,
to
the
shame
and
indelicacy
of
our
language
<EOS>
be
<EOS>
it
spoke
,
there
is
no
chaste
word
throughout
all
Johnson
's
dictionary
 
let
it
suffice
to
say
 
it
was
that
particular
aperture
which
,
in
all
good
societies
,
the
laws
of
decorum
do
strictly
require
,
like
the
temple
of
Janus
(
in
peace
at
least
)
to
be
universally
shut
up
.
  
<EOS>
The
neglect
of
this
punctilio
in
Phutatorius
(
which
by
-
the
-
bye
should
be
a
warning
to
all
mankind
)
<EOS>
had
opened
a
door
to
this
accident
.
    
<EOS>
Accident
<EOS>
I
call
it
,
in
compliance
to
a
received
mode
of
speaking
 
but
in
no
opposition
to
the
opinion
either
of
Acrites
or
Mythogeras
<EOS>
in
this
matter
;
I
know
they
were
both
prepossessed
and
fully
persuaded
of
it
 
and
are
so
to
this
hour
,
That
there
was
nothing
of
accident
in
the
whole
event
 
but
that
the
chesnut
's
taking
that
particular
course
,
and
in
a
manner
of
its
own
accord
 
and
then
falling
with
all
its
heat
directly
into
that
one
particular
place
,
and
no
other
 
was
a
real
judgment
upon
Phutatorius
for
that
filthy
and
obscene
treatise
de
Concubinis
retinendis
,
which
Phutatorius
had
published
about
twenty
years
ago
 
and
was
that
identical
week
going
to
give
the
world
a
second
edition
of
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
not
my
business
to
dip
my
pen
in
this
controversy
 
much
undoubtedly
may
be
wrote
on
both
sides
of
the
question
 
all
that
concerns
me
as
an
historian
,
is
to
represent
the
matter
of
fact
,
and
render
it
credible
to
the
reader
,
that
the
hiatus
in
Phutatorius
's
breeches
was
sufficiently
wide
to
receive
the
chesnut
;
 
and
that
the
chesnut
,
somehow
or
other
,
did
fall
perpendicularly
,
and
piping
hot
into
it
,
without
Phutatorius
's
perceiving
it
,
or
any
one
else
at
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
The
genial
warmth
which
the
chesnut
imparted
,
was
not
undelectable
for
the
first
twenty
or
five
-
and
-
twenty
seconds
 
and
did
no
more
than
gently
solicit
Phutatorius
's
attention
towards
the
part
:
 
<EOS>
But
the
heat
gradually
increasing
,
and
in
a
few
seconds
more
getting
beyond
the
point
of
all
sober
pleasure
,
and
then
advancing
with
all
speed
into
the
regions
of
pain
,
the
soul
of
Phutatorius
,
together
with
all
his
ideas
,
his
thoughts
,
his
attention
,
his
imagination
,
judgment
,
resolution
,
deliberation
,
ratiocination
,
memory
,
fancy
,
with
ten
battalions
of
animal
spirits
,
all
tumultuously
crowded
down
,
through
different
defiles
and
circuits
,
to
the
place
of
danger
,
leaving
all
his
upper
regions
,
as
you
may
imagine
,
as
empty
as
my
purse
.
  
<EOS>
With
the
best
intelligence
which
all
these
messengers
could
bring
him
back
,
Phutatorius
was
not
able
to
dive
into
the
secret
of
what
was
going
forwards
below
,
nor
could
he
make
any
kind
of
conjecture
,
what
the
devil
was
the
matter
with
it
:
 
<EOS>
However
,
as
he
knew
not
what
the
true
cause
might
turn
out
,
he
deemed
it
most
prudent
in
the
situation
he
was
in
at
present
,
to
bear
it
,
if
possible
,
like
a
Stoick
;
which
,
with
the
help
of
some
wry
faces
and
compursions
of
the
mouth
,
he
had
certainly
accomplished
,
had
his
imagination
continued
neuter
;
 
but
the
sallies
of
the
imagination
are
ungovernable
in
things
of
this
kind
 
<EOS>
a
thought
instantly
darted
into
his
mind
,
that
tho
'
<EOS>
the
anguish
had
the
sensation
of
glowing
heat
 
<EOS>
it
might
,
notwithstanding
that
,
be
a
bite
as
well
as
a
burn
;
and
if
so
,
that
possibly
a
Newt
or
an
Asker
,
or
some
such
detested
reptile
,
had
crept
up
,
and
was
fastening
his
teeth
 
<EOS>
the
horrid
idea
of
which
,
with
a
fresh
glow
of
pain
arising
that
instant
from
the
chesnut
,
seized
Phutatorius
with
a
sudden
panick
,
and
in
the
first
terrifying
disorder
of
the
passion
,
it
threw
him
,
as
it
has
done
the
best
generals
upon
earth
,
quite
off
his
guard
:
 
the
effect
of
which
was
this
,
that
he
leapt
incontinently
up
,
uttering
as
he
rose
that
interjection
of
surprise
so
much
descanted
upon
,
with
the
aposiopestic
break
after
it
,
marked
thus
,
Z
...
ds
 
<EOS>
which
,
though
not
strictly
canonical
,
was
still
as
little
as
any
man
could
have
said
upon
the
occasion
;
 
and
which
,
by
-
the
-
bye
,
whether
canonical
or
not
,
Phutatorius
could
no
more
help
than
he
could
the
cause
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Though
this
has
taken
up
some
time
in
the
narrative
,
it
took
up
little
more
time
in
the
transaction
,
than
just
to
allow
time
for
Phutatorius
to
draw
forth
the
chesnut
,
and
throw
it
down
with
violence
upon
the
floor
 
and
for
Yorick
to
rise
from
his
chair
,
and
pick
the
chesnut
up
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
curious
to
observe
the
triumph
of
slight
incidents
over
the
mind
:
  
<EOS>
What
incredible
weight
they
have
in
forming
and
governing
our
opinions
,
both
of
men
and
things
 
<EOS>
that
trifles
,
light
as
air
,
shall
waft
a
belief
into
the
soul
,
and
plant
it
so
immoveably
within
it
 
that
Euclid
's
demonstrations
,
could
they
be
brought
to
batter
it
in
breach
,
should
not
all
have
power
to
overthrow
it
.
  
<EOS>
Yorick
,
I
said
,
picked
up
the
chesnut
which
Phutatorius
's
wrath
had
flung
down
 
<EOS>
the
action
was
trifling
 
I
am
ashamed
to
account
for
it
 
<EOS>
he
did
it
,
for
no
reason
,
but
that
he
thought
the
chesnut
not
a
jot
worse
for
the
adventure
 
and
that
he
held
a
good
chesnut
worth
stooping
for
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
incident
,
trifling
as
it
was
,
wrought
differently
in
Phutatorius
's
head
:
 
<EOS>
He
considered
this
act
of
Yorick
's
in
getting
off
his
chair
and
picking
up
the
chesnut
,
as
a
plain
acknowledgment
in
him
,
that
the
chesnut
was
originally
his
 
and
in
course
,
that
it
must
have
been
the
owner
of
the
chesnut
,
and
no
one
else
,
who
could
have
played
him
such
a
prank
with
it
:
 
<EOS>
What
greatly
confirmed
him
in
this
opinion
,
was
this
,
that
the
table
being
parallelogramical
and
very
narrow
,
it
afforded
a
fair
opportunity
for
Yorick
,
who
sat
directly
over
against
Phutatorius
,
of
slipping
the
chesnut
in
 
and
consequently
that
he
did
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
look
of
something
more
than
suspicion
,
which
Phutatorius
cast
full
upon
Yorick
as
these
thoughts
arose
,
too
evidently
spoke
his
opinion
 
and
as
Phutatorius
was
naturally
supposed
to
know
more
of
the
matter
than
any
person
besides
,
his
opinion
at
once
became
the
general
one
;
 
and
for
a
reason
very
different
from
any
which
have
been
yet
given
 
in
a
little
time
it
was
put
out
of
all
manner
of
dispute
.
  
<EOS>
When
great
or
unexpected
events
fall
out
upon
the
stage
of
this
sublunary
world
 
<EOS>
the
mind
of
man
,
which
is
an
inquisitive
kind
of
a
substance
,
naturally
takes
a
flight
behind
the
scenes
to
see
what
is
the
cause
and
first
spring
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
search
was
not
long
in
this
instance
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
well
known
that
Yorick
had
never
a
good
opinion
of
the
treatise
which
Phutatorius
had
wrote
de
Concubinis
retinendis
,
as
a
thing
which
he
feared
had
done
hurt
in
the
world
 
and
'
twas
easily
found
out
,
that
there
was
a
mystical
meaning
in
Yorick
's
prank
 
and
that
his
chucking
the
chesnut
hot
into
Phutatorius
's
.
<EOS>
.
.
 
<EOS>
.
.
.
,
was
a
sarcastical
fling
at
his
book
  
the
doctrines
of
which
,
they
said
,
had
enflamed
many
an
honest
man
in
the
same
place
.
  
<EOS>
This
conceit
awaken'd
<EOS>
Somnolentus
 
made
Agelastes
smile
 
<EOS>
and
if
you
can
recollect
the
precise
look
and
air
of
a
man
's
face
intent
in
finding
out
a
riddle
 
<EOS>
it
threw
Gastripheres
's
into
that
form
 
and
in
short
was
thought
by
many
to
be
a
master
-
stroke
of
arch
-
wit
.
  
<EOS>
This
,
as
the
reader
has
seen
from
one
end
to
the
other
,
was
as
groundless
as
the
dreams
of
philosophy
:
 
Yorick
,
no
doubt
,
as
Shakespeare
said
of
his
ancestor
 
"
was
a
man
of
jest
,
"
but
it
was
temper'd
with
something
which
withheld
him
from
that
,
and
many
other
ungracious
pranks
,
of
which
he
as
undeservedly
bore
the
blame
;
 
but
it
was
his
misfortune
all
his
life
long
to
bear
the
imputation
of
saying
and
doing
a
thousand
things
,
of
which
(
unless
my
esteem
blinds
me
)
<EOS>
his
nature
was
incapable
.
 
<EOS>
All
I
blame
him
for
 
or
rather
,
all
I
blame
and
alternately
like
him
for
,
was
that
singularity
of
his
temper
,
which
would
never
suffer
him
to
take
pains
to
set
a
story
right
with
the
world
,
however
in
his
power
.
 
<EOS>
In
every
ill
usage
of
that
sort
,
he
acted
precisely
as
in
the
affair
of
his
lean
horse
 
he
could
have
explained
it
to
his
honour
,
but
his
spirit
was
above
it
;
and
besides
,
he
ever
looked
upon
the
inventor
,
the
propagator
and
believer
of
an
illiberal
report
alike
so
injurious
to
him
 
he
could
not
stoop
to
tell
his
story
to
them
 
and
so
trusted
to
time
and
truth
to
do
it
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
This
heroic
cast
produced
him
inconveniences
in
many
respects
 
in
the
present
it
was
followed
by
the
fixed
resentment
of
Phutatorius
,
who
,
as
Yorick
had
just
made
an
end
of
his
chesnut
,
rose
up
from
his
chair
a
second
time
,
to
let
him
know
it
 
<EOS>
which
indeed
he
did
with
a
smile
;
saying
only
  
that
he
would
endeavour
not
to
forget
the
obligation
.
  
<EOS>
But
you
must
mark
and
carefully
separate
and
distinguish
these
two
things
in
your
mind
.
    
<EOS>
The
smile
was
for
the
company
.
    
<EOS>
The
threat
was
for
Yorick
.
      
<EOS>
Can
you
tell
me
,
quoth
Phutatorius
,
speaking
to
Gastripheres
who
sat
next
to
him
 
for
one
would
not
apply
to
a
surgeon
in
so
foolish
an
affair
 
<EOS>
can
you
tell
me
,
Gastripheres
,
what
is
best
to
take
out
the
fire
?
 
<EOS>
Ask
Eugenius
,
said
Gastripheres
.
 
<EOS>
That
greatly
depends
,
said
Eugenius
,
pretending
ignorance
of
the
adventure
,
upon
the
nature
of
the
part
 
If
it
is
a
tender
part
,
and
a
part
which
can
conveniently
be
wrapt
up
 
<EOS>
It
is
both
the
one
and
the
other
,
replied
Phutatorius
,
laying
his
hand
as
he
spoke
,
with
an
emphatical
nod
of
his
head
,
upon
the
part
in
question
,
and
lifting
up
his
right
leg
at
the
same
time
to
ease
and
ventilate
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
that
is
the
case
,
said
Eugenius
,
I
would
advise
you
,
Phutatorius
,
not
to
tamper
with
it
by
any
means
;
but
if
you
will
send
to
the
next
printer
,
and
trust
your
cure
to
such
a
simple
thing
as
a
soft
sheet
of
paper
just
come
off
the
press
  
<EOS>
you
need
do
nothing
more
than
twist
it
round
.
 
<EOS>
The
damp
paper
,
quoth
Yorick
(
who
sat
next
to
his
friend
Eugenius
)
though
I
know
it
has
a
refreshing
coolness
in
it
 
<EOS>
yet
I
presume
is
no
more
than
the
vehicle
 
and
that
the
oil
and
lamp
-
black
with
which
the
paper
is
so
strongly
impregnated
,
does
the
business
.
 
<EOS>
Right
,
said
Eugenius
,
and
is
,
of
any
outward
application
I
would
venture
to
recommend
,
the
most
anodyne
and
safe
.
  
<EOS>
Was
it
my
case
,
said
Gastripheres
,
as
the
main
thing
is
the
oil
and
lamp-
black
,
I
should
spread
them
thick
upon
a
rag
,
and
clap
it
on
directly
.
  
<EOS>
That
would
make
a
very
devil
of
it
,
replied
Yorick
.
 
<EOS>
And
besides
,
added
Eugenius
,
it
would
not
answer
the
intention
,
which
is
the
extreme
neatness
and
elegance
of
the
prescription
,
which
the
Faculty
hold
to
be
half
in
half
;
 
for
consider
,
if
the
type
is
a
very
small
one
(
which
it
should
be
)
<EOS>
the
sanative
particles
,
which
come
into
contact
in
this
form
,
have
the
advantage
of
being
spread
so
infinitely
thin
,
and
with
such
a
mathematical
equality
(
fresh
paragraphs
and
large
capitals
excepted
)
as
no
art
or
management
of
the
spatula
can
come
up
to
.
 
<EOS>
It
falls
out
very
luckily
,
replied
Phutatorius
,
that
the
second
edition
of
my
treatise
de
Concubinis
retinendis
is
at
this
instant
in
the
press
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
take
any
leaf
of
it
,
said
Eugenius
 
<EOS>
no
matter
which
.
 
<EOS>
Provided
,
quoth
Yorick
,
there
is
no
bawdry
in
it
.
    
<EOS>
They
are
just
now
,
replied
Phutatorius
,
printing
off
the
ninth
chapter
  
which
is
the
last
chapter
but
one
in
the
book
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
what
is
the
title
of
that
chapter
?
<EOS>
said
Yorick
;
making
a
respectful
bow
to
Phutatorius
as
he
spoke
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
,
answered
Phutatorius
,
'
tis
<EOS>
that
de
re
concubinaria
.
  
<EOS>
For
Heaven
's
sake
keep
out
of
that
chapter
,
quoth
Yorick
.
    
<EOS>
By
all
means
 
added
Eugenius
.
       
<EOS>
Now
,
quoth
Didius
,
rising
up
,
and
laying
his
right
hand
with
his
fingers
spread
upon
his
breast
 
had
such
a
blunder
about
a
christian
-
name
happened
before
the
Reformation
 
<EOS>
(
It
happened
the
day
before
yesterday
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
to
himself
)
 
<EOS>
and
when
baptism
was
administer'd
in
Latin
 
(
'
Twas
all
in
English
,
said
my
uncle
)
 
<EOS>
many
things
might
have
coincided
with
it
,
and
upon
the
authority
of
sundry
decreed
cases
,
to
have
pronounced
the
baptism
null
,
with
a
power
of
giving
the
child
a
new
name
 
<EOS>
Had
a
priest
,
for
instance
,
which
was
no
uncommon
thing
,
through
ignorance
of
the
Latin
tongue
,
baptized
a
child
of
Tom
-
o'Stiles
,
in
nomine
patriae
&
filia
&
spiritum
sanctos
 
<EOS>
the
baptism
was
held
null
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
,
replied
Kysarcius
 
in
that
case
,
<EOS>
as
the
mistake
was
only
the
terminations
,
the
baptism
was
valid
 
and
to
have
rendered
it
null
,
the
blunder
of
the
priest
should
have
fallen
upon
the
first
syllable
of
each
noun
 
and
not
,
as
in
your
case
,
upon
the
last
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
delighted
in
subtleties
of
this
kind
,
and
listen'd
with
infinite
attention
.
  
<EOS>
Gastripheres
,

continued
Kysarcius
,
baptizes
a

&

instead

&

<EOS>
Is
this
a
baptism
?
 
<EOS>
No
 
say
the
ablest
canonists
;
in
as
much
as
the
radix
of
each
word
is
hereby
torn
up
,
and
the
sense
and
meaning
of
them
removed
and
changed
quite
to
another
object
;
for
Gomine
does
not
signify
a
name
,
nor
gatris
a
father
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
they
signify
?
<EOS>
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
at
all
 
<EOS>
quoth
Yorick
.
 
<EOS>
Ergo
,
such
a
baptism
is
null
,
said
Kysarcius
.
    
<EOS>
In
course
,
answered
Yorick
,
in
a
tone
two
parts
jest
and
one
part
earnest
.
    
<EOS>
But
in
the
case
cited
,
continued
Kysarcius
,
where
patriae
is
put
for
patris
,
filia
for
filii
,
and
so
on
 
as
it
is
a
fault
only
in
the
declension
,
and
the
roots
of
the
words
continue
untouch'd
,
the
inflections
of
their
branches
either
this
way
or
that
,
does
not
in
any
sort
hinder
the
baptism
,
inasmuch
as
the
same
sense
continues
in
the
words
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
But
then
,
said
Didius
,
the
intention
of
the
priest
's
pronouncing
them
grammatically
must
have
been
proved
to
have
gone
along
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
Right
,
answered
Kysarcius
;
and
of
this
,
brother
Didius
,
we
have
an
instance
in
a
decree
of
the
decretals
of
Pope
Leo
the
IIId
.
 
<EOS>
But
my
brother
's
child
,
cried
my
uncle
Toby
,
has
nothing
to
do
with
<EOS>
the
Pope
 
'
tis
the
plain
child
of
a
Protestant
gentleman
,
<EOS>
christen'd
Tristram
against
the
wills
and
wishes
both
of
his
father
and
mother
,
and
all
who
are
a
-
kin
to
it
.
    
<EOS>
If
the
wills
and
wishes
,
said
Kysarcius
,
interrupting
my
uncle
Toby
,
of
those
only
who
stand
related
to
Mr.
Shandy
's
child
,
were
to
have
weight
in
this
matter
,
Mrs.
Shandy
,
of
all
people
,
has
the
least
to
do
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
lay'd
down
his
pipe
,
and
my
father
drew
his
chair
still
closer
to
the
table
,
to
hear
the
conclusion
of
so
strange
an
introduction
.
    
<EOS>
It
has
not
only
been
a
question
,
Captain
Shandy
,
amongst
the

<EOS>
best
lawyers
and
civilians
in
this
land
,
continued
Kysarcius
,
"
Whether
the
mother
be
of
kin
to
her
child
,
"
  
<EOS>
but
,
after
much
dispassionate
enquiry
and
jactitation
of
the
arguments
on
all
sides
 
<EOS>
it
has
been
adjudged
for
the
negative
 
namely
,
"
That
the

is
not

<EOS>
My
father
instantly
<EOS>
clapp'd
<EOS>
his
hand
upon
my
uncle
Toby
's
mouth
,
under
colour
of
whispering
in
his
ear
;
 
the
truth
was
,
he
was
alarmed
for
Lillabullero
 
and
having
a
great
desire
to
hear
more
of
so
curious
an
argument
 
<EOS>
he
begg'd
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
for
heaven
's
sake
,
not
to
disappoint
him
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
gave
a
nod
 
resumed
his
pipe
,
and
contenting
himself
with
whistling
Lillabullero
inwardly
 
Kysarcius
,
Didius
,
and
Triptolemus
went
on
with
the
discourse
as
follows
:
  
<EOS>
This
determination
,
continued
Kysarcius
,
how
contrary
soever
it
may
seem
to
run
to
the
stream
of
vulgar
ideas
,
yet
had
reason
strongly
on
its
side
;
and
has
been
put
out
of
all
manner
of
dispute
from
the
famous
case
,
known
commonly
by
the
name
of
the
Duke
of
Suffolk
's
case
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
cited
in
Brook
,
said
Triptolemus
 
<EOS>
And
taken
notice
of
by
Lord
Coke
,
added
Didius
.
 
<EOS>
And
you
may
find
it
in
Swinburn
on
Testaments
,
said
Kysarcius
.
  
<EOS>
The
case
,
Mr.
Shandy
,
was
this
:
  
<EOS>
In
the
reign
of
Edward
the
Sixth
,
Charles
duke
of
Suffolk
having
issue
a
son
by
one
venter
,
and
a
daughter
by
another
venter
,
made
his
last
will
,
wherein
he
devised
goods
to
his
son
,
and
died
;
after
whose
death
the
son
died
also
 
but
without
will
,
without
wife
,
and
without
child
 
his
mother
and
his
sister
by
the
father
's
side
<EOS>
(
for
she
was
born
of
the
former
venter
)
then
living
.
 
<EOS>
The
mother
took
the
administration
of
her
son
's
goods
,
according
to
the
statute
of
the
21st
of
Harry
the
Eighth
,
whereby
it
is
enacted
,
That
in
case
any
person
die
intestate
the
administration
of
his
goods
shall
be
committed
to
the
next
of
kin
.
  
<EOS>
The
administration
being
thus
(
surreptitiously
)
granted
to
the
mother
,
the
sister
by
the
father
's
side
commenced
a
suit
before
the
Ecclesiastical
Judge
,
alledging
,
1st
,
That
she
herself
was
next
of
kin
;
and
2dly
,
That
the
mother
was
not
of
kin
at
all
to
the
party
deceased
;
and
therefore
prayed
the
court
,
that
the
administration
granted
to
the
mother
might
be
revoked
,
and
be
committed
unto
her
,
as
next
of
kin
to
the
deceased
,
by
force
of
the
said
statute
.
  
<EOS>
Hereupon
,
as
it
was
a
great
cause
,
and
much
depending
upon
its
issue
 
and
many
causes
of
great
property
likely
to
be
decided
in
times
to
come
,
by
the
precedent
to
be
then
made
 
the
most
learned
,
as
well
in
the
laws
of
this
realm
,
as
in
the
civil
law
,
were
consulted
together
,
whether
the
mother
was
of
kin
to
her
son
,
or
no
.
 
<EOS>
Whereunto
not
only
the
temporal
lawyers
 
but
the
church
lawyers
 
<EOS>
the
juris

the
judges
of

consistory
and
prerogative
courts
of
Canterbury
and
York
,
with
the
master
of

faculties
,
were
all
unanimously
of
opinion
,
That
the
mother
was
not
of
(

<EOS>
kin
to
her
child
.
    
<EOS>
And
what
said
the
duchess
of
Suffolk
to
it
?
<EOS>
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
  
<EOS>
The
unexpectedness
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
question
,
confounded
Kysarcius
more
than
the
ablest
advocate
 
<EOS>
He
<EOS>
stopp'd
a
full
minute
,
looking
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
face
without
replying
 
and
in
that
single
minute
Triptolemus
put
by
him
,
and
took
the
lead
as
follows
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
a
ground
and
principle
in
the
law
,
said
Triptolemus
,
that
things
do
not
ascend
,
but
descend
in
it
;
and
I
make
no
doubt
'
tis
for
this
cause
,
that
however
true
it
is
,
that
the
child
may
be
of
the
blood
and
seed
of
its
parents
 
that
the
parents
,
nevertheless
,
are
not
of
the
blood
and
seed
of
it
;
inasmuch
as
the
parents
are
not
begot
by
the
child
,
but
the
child
by
the
parents
 
<EOS>
For
<EOS>
so
they
write
,
Liberi
sunt
de
sanguine
patris
&
matris
,
sed
pater
&
mater
non
sunt
de
sanguine
liberorum
.
    
<EOS>
But
this
,
Triptolemus
,
cried
Didius
,
proves
too
much
 
for
from
this
authority
<EOS>
cited
it
would
follow
,
not
only
what
indeed
is
granted
on
all
sides
,
that
the
mother
is
not
of
kin
to
her
child
 
but
the
father
likewise
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
held
,
said
Triptolemus
,
the
better
opinion
;
because
the
father
,
the
mother
,
and
the
child
,
though
they
be
three
persons
,
yet
are
they
<EOS>
but
(

Vide

)
<EOS>
one
flesh
;
and
consequently
no
degree
of
kindred
 
or
any
method
of
acquiring
one
in
nature
.
 
<EOS>
There
you
push
the
argument
again
too
far
,
cried
Didius
 
for
there
is
no
prohibition
in
nature
,
though
there
is
in
the
Levitical
law
 
but
that
a
man
may
beget
a
child
upon
his
grandmother
 
in
which
case
,
supposing
the
issue
a
daughter
<EOS>
,
she
would
stand
in
relation
both
of
 
<EOS>
But
who
ever
thought
,
cried
Kysarcius
,
of
laying
with
his
grandmother
?
 
<EOS>
The
young
gentleman
,
replied
Yorick
,
whom
Selden
speaks
of
 
who
not
only
thought
of
it
,
but
justified
his
intention
to
his
father
by
the
argument
drawn
from
the
law
of
retaliation
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
laid
,
Sir
,
with
my
mother
,
"
said
the
lad
  
<EOS>
"
why
may
not
I
lay
with
yours
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
the
Argumentum
commune
,
added
Yorick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tis
as
good
,
replied
Eugenius
,
taking
down
his
hat
,
as
they
deserve
.
  
<EOS>
The
company
broke
up
.
      
<EOS>
And
pray
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
leaning
upon
Yorick
,
as
he
and
my
father
were
helping
him
leisurely
down
the
stairs
 
<EOS>
do
n't
be
terrified
,
madam
,
<EOS>
this
stair
-
case
conversation
is
not
so
long
as
the
last
 
And
pray
,
Yorick
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
which
way
is
this
said
affair
of
Tristram
at
length
settled
by
these
learned
men
?
 
<EOS>
Very
satisfactorily
,
replied
Yorick
;
no
mortal
,
Sir
,
has
any
concern
with
it
 
for
Mrs.
Shandy
<EOS>
the
mother
is
nothing
at
all
a
-
kin
to
him
 
and
as
the
mother
's
is
the
surest
side
 
Mr.
Shandy
,
in
course
is
still
less
than
nothing
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
he
is
not
as
much
a
-
kin
to
him
,
Sir
,
as
I
am
.
      
<EOS>
That
may
well
be
,
said
my
father
,
shaking
his
head
.
    
<EOS>
Let
the
learned
say
what
they
will
,
there
must
certainly
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
have
been
some
sort
of
consanguinity
betwixt
the
duchess
of
Suffolk
and
her
son
.
  
<EOS>
The
vulgar
are
of
the
same
opinion
,
quoth
Yorick
,
to
this
hour
.
    
<EOS>
Though
my
father
was
hugely
tickled
with
the
subtleties
of
these
learned
discourses
 
'
twas
still
<EOS>
but
like
the
anointing
of
a
broken
bone
 
<EOS>
The
moment
he
got
home
,
the
weight
of
his
afflictions
returned
upon
him
but
<EOS>
so
much
the
heavier
,
as
is
ever
the
case
when
the
staff
we
lean
on
slips
from
under
us
.
 
<EOS>
He
became
pensive
 
<EOS>
walked
frequently
forth
to
the
fish
-
pond
 
<EOS>
let
down
one
loop
of
his
hat
 
sigh'd
<EOS>
often
 
forbore
to
snap
 
<EOS>
and
,
as
the
hasty
sparks
of
temper
,
which
occasion
snapping
,
so
much
assist
perspiration
and
digestion
,
as
Hippocrates
tells
us
 
he
had
certainly
fallen
ill
with
the
extinction
of
them
,
had
not
his
thoughts
been
critically
drawn
off
,
and
his
health
rescued
by
a
fresh
train
of
disquietudes
left
him
,
with
a
legacy
of
a
thousand
pounds
,
by
my
aunt
Dinah
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
had
scarce
read
the
letter
,
when
taking
the
thing
by
the
right
end
,
he
instantly
began
to
plague
and
puzzle
his
head
how
to
lay
it
out
mostly
to
the
honour
of
his
family
.
 
<EOS>
A
hundred
-
and
-
fifty
<EOS>
odd
projects
took
possession
of
his
brains
by
turns
 
he
would
do
this
,
and
that
and
t'other
  
<EOS>
He
would
go
to
Rome
 
<EOS>
he
would
go
to
law
 
<EOS>
he
would
buy
stock
 
<EOS>
he
would
buy
John
Hobson
's
farm
 
<EOS>
he
would
new
fore
front
his
house
,
and
add
a
new
wing
to
make
it
even
 
There
was
a
fine
water
-
mill
on
this
side
,
and
he
would
build
a
wind
-
mill
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
in
full
view
to
answer
it
 
<EOS>
But
above
all
things
in
the
world
,
he
would
inclose
the
great
Ox
-
moor
,
and
send
out
my
brother
Bobby
immediately
upon
his
travels
.
  
<EOS>
But
as
the
sum
was
finite
,
and
consequently
could
not
do
every
thing
 
and
in
truth
<EOS>
very
few
of
these
to
any
purpose
 
of
all
the
projects
which
offered
themselves
upon
this
occasion
,
the
two
last
seemed
to
make
the
deepest
impression
;
and
he
would
infallibly
have
determined
upon
both
at
once
,
but
for
the
small
inconvenience
hinted
at
above
,
which
absolutely
put
him
under
a
necessity
of
deciding
in
favour
either
of
the
one
or
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
not
altogether
so
easy
to
be
done
;
for
though
'
tis
certain
my
father
had
long
before
set
his
heart
upon
this
necessary
part
of
my
brother
's
education
,
and
like
a
prudent
man
had
actually
determined
to
carry
it
into
execution
,
with
the
first
money
that
returned
from
the
second
creation
of
actions
in
the
Missisippi
-
scheme
,
in
which
he
was
an
adventurer
 
yet
the
Ox
-
moor
,
which
was
a
fine
,
large
,
whinny
,
undrained
,
unimproved
common
,
belonging
to
the
Shandy

estate
,
had
almost
as

a
claim
upon
him
:
 
he
had
long
and
affectionately
set
his
heart
upon
turning
it
likewise
to
some
account
.
  
<EOS>
But
having
never
hitherto
been
pressed
with
such
a
conjuncture
of
things
,
as
made
it
necessary
to
settle
either
the
priority
or
justice
of
their
claims
 
like
a
wise
man
he
had
refrained
entering
into
any
nice
or
critical
examination
about
them
:
 
so
that
upon
the
dismission
of
every
other
project
at
this
crisis
 
<EOS>
the
two
old
projects
,
the
Ox
-
moor
and
my
Brother
,
divided
him
again
;
and
so
equal
a
match
were
they
for
each
other
,
as
to
become
the
occasion
of
no
small
contest
in
the
old
gentleman
's
mind
 
which
of
the
two
should
be
set
o'going
first
.
    
<EOS>
People
may
laugh
as
they
will
 
but
the
case
was
this
.
  
<EOS>
It
had
ever
been
the
custom
of
the
family
,
and
by
length
of
time
was
almost
become
a
matter
of
common
right
,
that
the
eldest
son
of
it
should
have
free
ingress
,
egress
,
and
regress
into
foreign
parts
before
marriage
 
not
only
for
the
sake
of
bettering
his
own
private
parts
,
by
the
benefit
of
exercise
and
change
of
so
much
air
 
<EOS>
but
simply
for
the
mere
delectation
of
his
fancy
,
by
the
feather
put
into
his
cap
,
of
having
been
abroad
 
<EOS>
tantum
valet
,
my
father
would
say
,
quantum
sonat
.
  
<EOS>
Now
as
this
was
a
reasonable
,
and
in
course
a
most
christian
indulgence
 
to
deprive
him
of
it
,
without
why
or
wherefore
 
and
thereby
make
an
example
of
him
,
as
the
first
Shandy
unwhirl'd
about
Europe
in
a
post
-
chaise
,
and
only
because
he
was
a
heavy
lad
 
would
be
using
him
ten
times
worse
than
a
Turk
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
the
case
of
the
Ox
-
moor
was
full
as
hard
.
  
<EOS>
Exclusive
of
the
original
purchase
-
money
,
which
was
eight
hundred
pounds
  
<EOS>
it
had
cost
the
family
eight
hundred
pounds
more
in
a
law
-
suit
about
fifteen
years
before
 
besides
the
Lord
knows
what
trouble
and
vexation
.
  
<EOS>
It
had
been
moreover
in
possession
of
the
Shandy
-
family
ever
since
the
middle
of
the
last
century
;
and
though
it
lay
full
in
view
before
the
house
,
bounded
on
one
extremity
by
the
water
-
mill
,
and
on
the
other
by
the
projected
wind
-
mill
spoken
of
above
 
and
for
all
these
reasons
seemed
to
have
the
fairest
title
of
any
part
of
the
estate
to
the
care
and
protection
of
the
family
 
yet
by
an
unaccountable
fatality
,
common
to
men
,
as
well
as
the
ground
they
tread
on
 
<EOS>
it
had
all
along
most
shamefully
been
overlook'd
;
and
to
speak
the
truth
of
it
,
had
suffered
so
much
by
it
,
that
it
would
have
made
any
man
's
heart
have
bled
(
Obadiah
said
)
who
understood
the
value
of
the
land
,
to
have
rode
over
it
,
and
only
seen
the
condition
it
was
in
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
as
neither
the
purchasing
this
tract
of
ground
 
nor
indeed
the
placing
of
it
where
it
lay
,
were
either
of
them
,
properly
speaking
,
of
my
father
's
doing
 
he
had
never
thought
himself
any
way
concerned
in
the
affair
 
till
the
fifteen
years
before
,
when
the
breaking
out
of
that
cursed
law
-
suit
mentioned
above
(
and
which
had
arose
about
its
boundaries
)
 
<EOS>
which
being
altogether
my
father
's
own
act
and
deed
,
it
naturally
awakened
every
other
argument
in
its
favour
,
and
upon
summing
them
all
up
together
,
he
saw
,
not
merely
in
interest
,
but
in
honour
,
he
was
bound
to
do
something
for
it
 
and
that
now
or
never
was
the
time
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
there
must
certainly
have
been
a
mixture
of
ill
-
luck
in
it
,
that
the
reasons
on
both
sides
should
happen
to
be
so
equally
balanced
by
each
other
;
for
though
my
father
weigh'd
<EOS>
them
in
all
humours
and
conditions
  
spent
many
an
anxious
hour
in
the
most
profound
and
abstracted
meditation
upon
what
was
best
to
be
done
 
reading
books
of
farming
one
day
 
books
of
travels
another
 
laying
aside
all
passion
<EOS>
whatever
 
viewing
the
arguments
on
both
sides
in
all
their
lights
and
circumstances
 
communing
every
day
with
my
uncle
Toby
 
arguing
with
Yorick
,
and
talking
over
the
whole
affair
of
the
Ox
-
moor
with
Obadiah
 
yet
nothing
in
all
that
time
appeared
so
strongly
in
behalf
of
the
one
,
which
was
not
either
strictly
applicable
to
the
other
,
or
at
least
so
far
counterbalanced
by
some
consideration
of
equal
weight
,
as
to
keep
the
scales
even
.
  
<EOS>
For
to
be
sure
,
with
proper
helps
,
in
the
hands
of
some
people
,
tho
'
the
Ox
-
moor
would
undoubtedly
have
made
a
different
appearance
in
the
world
from
what
it
did
,
or
ever
could
do
in
the
condition
it
lay
 
yet
<EOS>
every
tittle
of
this
was
true
,
with
regard
to
my
brother
<EOS>
Bobby
 
<EOS>
let
Obadiah
say
what
he
would
.
    
<EOS>
In
point
of
interest
 
<EOS>
the
contest
,
I
own
,
at
first
sight
,
did
not
appear
<EOS>
so
undecisive
betwixt
them
;
for
whenever
my
father
took
pen
and
ink
in
hand
,
and
set
about
calculating
the
simple
expence
of
paring
and
burning
,
and
fencing
in
the
Ox
-
moor
,
&
c.
&
c.
 
with
the
certain
profit
it
would
bring
him
in
return
 
<EOS>
the
latter
turned
out
so
prodigiously
in
his
way
of
working
the
account
,
that
you
would
have
sworn
the
Ox
-
moor
would
have
carried
all
before
it
.
 
<EOS>
For
it
was
plain
he
should
reap
a
hundred
lasts
of
rape
,
at
twenty
pounds
a
last
,
the
very
first
year
 
besides
an
excellent
crop
of
wheat
the
year
following
 
and
the
year
after
that
,
to
speak
within
bounds
,
a
hundred
 
<EOS>
but
in
all
likelihood
,
a
hundred
and
fifty
 
if
not
two
hundred
quarters
of
pease
and
beans
 
besides
potatoes
without
end
.
 
<EOS>
But
then
,
to
think
he
was
all
this
while
breeding
up
my
brother
,
like
a
hog
to
eat
them
 
knocked
all
on
the
head
again
,
and
generally
left
the
old
gentleman
in
such
a
state
of
suspense
 
that
,
as
he
often
declared
to
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
he
knew
no
more
than
his
heels
what
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
No
body
,
but
he
who
has
felt
it
,
can
conceive
what
a
plaguing
thing
it
is
to
have
a
man
's
mind
torn
asunder
by
two
projects
of
equal
strength
,
both
obstinately
pulling
in
a
contrary
direction
at
the
same
time
:
 
for
to
say
nothing
of
the
havock
,
which
by
a
certain
consequence
is
unavoidably
made
by
it
all
over
the
finer
system
of
the
nerves
,
which
you
know
convey
the
animal
spirits
and
more
subtle
juices
from
the
heart
to
the
head
,
and
so
on
 
it
is
not
to
be
told
in
what
a
degree
such
a
wayward
kind
of
friction
works
upon
the
more
gross
and
solid
parts
,
wasting
the
fat
and
impairing
the
strength
of
a
man
every
time
as
it
goes
backwards
and
forwards
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
had
certainly
sunk
under
this
evil
,
as
certainly
as
he
had
done
under
that
of
my
Christian
Name
 
<EOS>
had
he
not
been
rescued
out
of
it
,
as
he
was
out
of
that
,
by
a
fresh
evil
 
the
misfortune
of
my
brother
Bobby
's
death
.
  
<EOS>
What
is
the
life
of
man
!
 
<EOS>
Is
it
not
to
shift
from
side
to
side
?
 
<EOS>
from
sorrow
to
sorrow
?
 
<EOS>
to
button
up
one
cause
of
vexation
 
and
unbutton
another
?
    
<EOS>
From
this
moment
I
am
to
be
considered
as
heir
-
apparent
to
the
Shandy
family
 
<EOS>
and
it
is
from
this
point
properly
,
that
the
story
of
my
Life
and
my
Opinions
sets
out
.
 
<EOS>
With
all
my
hurry
and
precipitation
,
I
have
but
been
clearing
the
ground
to
raise
the
building
 
and
such
a
building
<EOS>
do
I
foresee
it
will
turn
out
,
as
never
was
planned
,
and
as
never
was
executed
since
Adam
.
 
<EOS>
In
less
than
five
minutes
I
shall
have
thrown
my
pen
into
the
fire
,
and
the
little
drop
of
thick
ink
which
is
left
remaining
at
the
bottom
of
my
ink
-
horn
,
after
it
 
<EOS>
I
have
<EOS>
but
half
a
score
things
to
do
in
the
time
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
thing
to
name
 
a
thing
to
lament
 
a
thing
to
hope
 
a
thing
to
promise
,
and
a
thing
to
threaten
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
thing
to
suppose
 
a
thing
to
declare
 
a
thing
to
conceal
 
a
thing
to
choose
,
and
a
thing
to
pray
for
  
This
chapter
<EOS>
,
therefore
,
I
name
the
chapter
of
Things
 
and
my
next
chapter
to
it
,
that
is
,
the
first
chapter
of
my
next
volume
,
if
I
live
,
shall
be
my
chapter
upon
Whiskers
,
in
order
to
keep
up
some
sort
of
connection
in
my
works
.
  
<EOS>
The
thing
I
lament
is
,
that
things
have
crowded
in
so
thick
upon
me
,
that
I
have
not
been
able
to
get
into
that
part
of
my
work
,
towards
which
I
have
all
the
way
looked
forwards
,
with
so
much
earnest
desire
;
and
that
is
the
Campaigns
,
but
especially
the
amours
of
my
uncle
Toby
,
the
events
of
which
are
of
so
singular
a
nature
,
and
so
Cervantick
a
cast
,
that
if
I
can
so
manage
it
,
as
to
convey
but
the
same
impressions
to
every
other
brain
,
which
the
occurrences
themselves
excite
in
my
own
 
<EOS>
I
will
answer
for
it
<EOS>
the
book
shall
make
its
way
in
the
world
,
much
better
than
its
master
has
done
before
it
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
Tristram
!
<EOS>
Tristram
!
<EOS>
can
this
but
be
once
brought
about
 
the
credit
,
which
will
attend
thee
as
an
author
,
shall
counterbalance
the
many
evils
will
have
befallen
thee
as
a
man
 
thou
wilt
feast
upon
the
one
 
when
thou
hast
lost
all
sense
and
remembrance
of
the
other
!
    
<EOS>
No
wonder
I
itch
so
much
as
I
do
,
to
get
at
these
amours
 
<EOS>
They
are
the
choicest
morsel
of
my
whole
story
!
<EOS>
and
when
I
do
get
at
'em
 
assure
yourselves
,
good
folks
 
<EOS>
(
nor
do
I
value
whose
squeamish
stomach
takes
offence
at
it
)
<EOS>
I
shall
not
be
at
all
nice
in
the
choice
of
my
words
!
 
<EOS>
and
that
's
the
thing
I
have
to
declare
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
get
all
through
in
five
minutes
,
<EOS>
that
I
fear
 
and
the
thing
I
hope
is
,
that
your
worships
and
reverences
are
not
offended
 
if
you
are
,
depend
upon't
<EOS>
I
'll
give
you
something
,
my
good
gentry
,
<EOS>
next
year
to
be
offended
at
 
<EOS>
that
's
my
dear
Jenny
's
way
 
<EOS>
but
who
my
Jenny
is
 
and
which
is
the
right
and
which
<EOS>
the
wrong
end
of
a
woman
,
is
the
thing
to
be
concealed
 
it
shall
be
told
you
in
the
next
chapter
but
one
to
my
chapter
of
Button
-
holes
 
and
not
one
chapter
before
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
that
you
have
just
got
to
the
end
of
these
(
According
to
the
preceding
Editions
.
)
<EOS>
three
volumes
 
<EOS>
the
thing
I
have
to
ask
is
,
how
you
feel
your
heads
?
<EOS>
my
own
akes
dismally
!
 
<EOS>
as
for
your
healths
,
I
know
,
they
are
much
better
.
 
<EOS>
True
Shandeism
,
think
what
you
will
against
it
,
opens
the
heart
and
lungs
,
and
like
all
those
affections
which
partake
of
its
nature
,
it
forces
the
blood
and
other
vital
fluids
of
the
body
to
run
freely
through
its
channels
,
makes
the
wheel
of
life
run
long
and
cheerfully
round
.
  
<EOS>
Was
I
left
,
like
Sancho
Panca
,
to
choose
my
kingdom
,
it
should
not
be
maritime
 
or
a
kingdom
of
blacks
to
make
a
penny
of
;
 
no
,
it
should
be
a
kingdom
of
hearty
laughing
subjects
:
 
<EOS>
And
as
the
bilious
and
more
saturnine
passions
,
by
creating
disorders
in
the
blood
and
humours
,
have
as
bad
an
influence
,
I
see
,
upon
the
body
politick
as
body
natural
 
and
as
nothing
but
a
habit
of
virtue
can
fully
govern
those
passions
,
and
subject
them
to
reason
 
I
should
add
to
my
prayer
 
that
God
would
give
my
subjects
grace
to
be
as
Wise
as
they
were
Merry
;
and
then
should
I
be
the
happiest
monarch
,
and
they
are
the
happiest
people
under
heaven
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
with
this
moral
for
the
present
<EOS>
,
may
it
please
your
worships
and
your
reverences
,
I
take
my
leave
of
you
till
this
time
twelve
-
month
,
when
,
(
unless
this
vile
cough
kills
me
in
the
mean
time
)
<EOS>
I
'll
have
another
pluck
at
your
beards
,
and
lay
open
a
story
to
the
world
you
little
dream
of

<EOS>
My
Lord

I
Humbly
beg
leave
to
offer
you
these
two
Volumes
(
Volumes
V.

VI

in
the

;
they
are
the
best
<EOS>
my
talents
,
with
such
bad
health
as
I
have
,
could
produce
:
 
<EOS>
had
Providence
granted
me
a
larger
stock
of
either
,
they
had
been
a
much
more
proper
present
to
your
Lordship
.
  
<EOS>
I
beg
your
Lordship
will
forgive
me
,
if
,
at
the
same
time
I
dedicate
this
work
to
you
,
I
join
Lady

,
in
the
liberty
I
take
of
inscribing
the
story
of
Le
Fever
to
her
name
;
for
which
I
have
no
other
motive
,
which
my
heart
has
informed
me

You
are
half
asleep
,
my
good
lady
,
said
the
old
gentleman
,
taking
hold
of
the
old
lady
's
hand
,
and
giving
it
a
gentle
squeeze
,
as
he
pronounced
the
word
<EOS>
Whiskers
 
<EOS>
shall
we
change
the
subject
?
 
<EOS>
By
no
means
,
replied
the
old
lady
 
<EOS>
I
like
your
account
of
those
matters
;
so
throwing
a
thin
gauze
handkerchief
over
her
head
,
and
leaning
it
back
upon
the
chair
with
her
face
turned
towards
him
,
and
advancing
her
two
feet
as
she
reclined
herself
 
<EOS>
I
desire
,
continued
she
,
you
will
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
went
on
as
follows
:
 
Whiskers
!
<EOS>
cried
the
queen
of
Navarre
,
dropping
her
knotting
ball
,
as
La
Fosseuse
uttered
the
word
  
Whiskers
,
madam
<EOS>
,
said
La
Fosseuse
,
pinning
the
ball
to
the
queen
's
apron
,
and
making
a
courtesy
as
she
repeated
it
.
  
<EOS>
La
Fosseuse
's
voice
was
naturally
soft
and
low
,
yet
'
twas
an
articulate
voice
:
 
and
every
letter
of
the
word
<EOS>
Whiskers
fell
distinctly
upon
the
queen
of
Navarre
's
ear
 
Whiskers
!
<EOS>
cried
the
queen
,
laying
a
greater
stress
upon
the
word
,
and
as
if
she
had
still
distrusted
her
ears
 
Whiskers
!
<EOS>
replied
La
Fosseuse
,
repeating
the
word
a
third
time
 
<EOS>
There
is
not
a
cavalier
,
madam
,
of
his
age
in
Navarre
,
continued
the
maid
of
honour
,
pressing
the
page
's
interest
upon
the
queen
,
that
has
so
gallant
a
pair
 
<EOS>
Of
what
?
<EOS>
cried
Margaret
,
smiling
 
Of
whiskers
,
said
La
Fosseuse
,
with
infinite
modesty
.
  
<EOS>
The
word
Whiskers
still
stood
its
ground
,
and
continued
to
be
made
use
of
in
most
of
the
best
companies
throughout
the
little
kingdom
of
Navarre
,
notwithstanding
the
indiscreet
use
which
La
Fosseuse
had
made
of
it
:
 
the
truth
was
,
La
Fosseuse
had
pronounced
the
word
,
not
only
before
the
queen
,
but
upon
sundry
other
occasions
at
court
,
with
an
accent
which
always
implied
something
of
a
mystery
 
<EOS>
And
as
the
court
of
Margaret
,
as
all
the
world
knows
,
was
at
that
time
a
mixture
of
gallantry
and
devotion
 
and
whiskers
being
as
applicable
to
the
one
,
as
the
other
,
the
word
naturally
stood
its
ground
 
<EOS>
it
gained
full
as
much
as
it
lost
;
that
is
,
the
clergy
were
for
it
 
<EOS>
the
laity
were
against
it
 
and
for
the
women
,
 
they
were
divided
.
  
<EOS>
The
excellency
of
the
figure
and
mien
of
the
young
Sieur
De
Croix
,
was
at
that
time
beginning
to
draw
the
attention
of
the
maids
of
honour
towards
the
terrace
before
the
palace
gate
,
where
the
guard
was
mounted
.
 
<EOS>
The
lady
De
Baussiere
fell
deeply
in
love
with
him
,
 
La
Battarelle
did
the
same
 
<EOS>
it
was
the
finest
weather
for
it
,
that
ever
was
remembered
in
Navarre
 
La
Guyol
,
La
Maronette
,
La
Sabatiere
,
<EOS>
fell
in
love
with
the
Sieur
De
Croix
also
 
<EOS>
La
Rebours
and
La
Fosseuse
knew
better
 
<EOS>
De
Croix
had
failed
in
an
attempt
to
recommend
himself
to
La
Rebours
;
and
La
Rebours
and
La
Fosseuse
were
inseparable
.
  
<EOS>
The
queen
of
Navarre
was
sitting
with
her
ladies
in
the
painted
bow
-
window
,
facing
the
gate
of
the
second
court
,
as
De
Croix
passed
through
it
 
<EOS>
He
is
handsome
,
said
the
Lady
Baussiere
 
<EOS>
He
has
a
good
mien
,
said
La
Battarelle
  
<EOS>
He
is
finely
shaped
,
said
La
Guyol
 
<EOS>
I
never
saw
an
officer
of
the
horse-
guards
in
my
life
,
said
La
Maronette
,
with
two
such
legs
 
<EOS>
Or
who
stood
so
well
upon
them
,
said
La
Sabatiere
 
<EOS>
But
he
has
no
whiskers
,
cried
La
Fosseuse
 
Not
a
pile
,
said
La
Rebours
.
  
<EOS>
The
queen
went
directly
to
her
oratory
,
musing
all
the
way
,
as
she
walked
through
the
gallery
,
upon
the
subject
;
turning
it
this
way
and
that
way
in
her
fancy
 
Ave
Maria
!
 
<EOS>
what
can
La
-
Fosseuse
mean
?
<EOS>
said
she
,
kneeling
down
upon
the
cushion
.
  
<EOS>
La
Guyol
,
La
Battarelle
,
La
Maronette
,
La
Sabatiere
,
retired
instantly
to
their
chambers
 
Whiskers

<EOS>
said
all
four
of
them
to
themselves
,
as
they
bolted
their
doors
on
the
inside

<EOS>
The
Lady
Carnavallette
was
counting
her
beads
with
both
hands
,
unsuspected
,
under
her
farthingal
 
from
St.
Antony
down
to
St.
Ursula
inclusive
,
not
a

St.

St.
Dominick

St.
Bennet

St.

St.

had

<EOS>
The

Baussiere
had
got
into
a
wilderness
of
conceits
,
with
moralizing
too
intricately
upon
La
Fosseuse

text
 
<EOS>
She
mounted

palfrey

She

There

La

The

I

<EOS>
@@@Twas
plain
to
the
whole
court
<EOS>
the
word
was
ruined
:
 
<EOS>
La
Fosseuse
had
given
it
a
wound
,
and
it
was
not
the
better
for
passing
through
all
these
defiles
 
<EOS>
It
made
a
faint
stand
,
however
,
for
a
few
months
,
by
the
expiration
of
which
,
the
Sieur
De
Croix
,
finding
it
high
time
to
leave
Navarre
for
want
of
whiskers
 
<EOS>
the
word
in
course
became
indecent
,
and
(
after
a
few
efforts
)
absolutely
unfit
for
use
.
  
<EOS>
The
best
word
,
in
the
best
language
of
the
best
world
,
must
have
suffered
under
such
combinations
.
 
<EOS>
The
curate
of
d'Estella
wrote
a
book
against
them
,
setting
forth
the
dangers
of
accessory
ideas
,
and
warning
the
Navarois
against
them
.
  
<EOS>
Does
not
all
the
world
know
,
said
the
curate
d'Estella
at
the
conclusion
of
his
work
,
that
Noses
ran
the
same
fate
some
centuries
ago
in
most
parts
of
Europe
,
which
Whiskers
have
now
done
in
the
kingdom
of
Navarre
?
 
<EOS>
The
evil
indeed
spread
no
farther
then
 
but
have
not
beds

bolsters
,
and
night-
caps
and
chamber

pots
stood
upon
the
brink
of
destruction
ever
since

Are
not
trouse

placket

holes

and

still
from
the

association

<EOS>
Chastity

by

the
gentlest

all
affections
 
give
it

<EOS>
The
drift
of
the
curate
d'Estella
's
argument
was
not
understood
.
 
<EOS>
They
ran
the
scent
the
wrong
way

<EOS>
The

bridled
his
ass

And
when
the
extremes
of
Delicacy

Concupiscence

that
bawdy

When

expence
of
his
riding
post
from
Calais
to
Paris
,
and
so
on
to
Lyons
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Twas
a
most
inauspicious
journey
;
my
father
having
had
every
foot
of
it
to
travel
over
again
,
and
his
calculation
to
begin
afresh
,
when
he
had
almost
got
to
the
end
of
it
,
by
Obadiah
's
opening
the
door
to
acquaint
him
the
family
was
out
of
yeast
 
and
to
ask
whether
he
might
not
take
the
great
coach
-
horse
early
in
the
morning
and
ride
in
search
of
some
.
 
<EOS>
With
all
my
heart
,
Obadiah
,
said
my
father
(
pursuing
his
journey
)
 
<EOS>
take
the
coach-
horse
,
and
welcome
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
wants
a
shoe
,
poor
creature
!
<EOS>
said
Obadiah
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
creature
!
<EOS>
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
vibrating
the
note
back
again
,
like
a
string
in
unison
.
 
<EOS>
Then
ride
the
Scotch
horse
,
quoth
my
father
hastily
.
 
<EOS>
He
can
not
bear
a
saddle
upon
his
back
,
quoth
Obadiah
,
for
the
whole
world
.
  
<EOS>
The
devil
's
in
that
horse
;
then
take
Patriot
,
cried
my
father
,
and
shut
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Patriot
is
sold
,
said
Obadiah
.
 
<EOS>
Here
's
for
you
!
<EOS>
cried
my
father
,
making
a
pause
,
and
looking
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
face
,
as
if
the
thing
had
not
been
a
matter
of
fact
.
 
<EOS>
Your
worship
ordered
me
to
sell
him
last
April
,
said
Obadiah
.
 
<EOS>
Then
go
on
foot
for
your
pains
,
cried
my
father
 
<EOS>
I
had
much
rather
walk
than
ride
,
said
Obadiah
,
shutting
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
What
plagues
,
cried
my
father
,
going
on
with
his
calculation
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
waters
are
out
,
said
Obadiah
,
 
opening
the
door
again
.
  
<EOS>
Till
that
moment
,
my
father
,
who
had
a
map
of
Sanson
's
,
and
a
book
of
the
post
-
roads
before
him
,
had
kept
his
hand
upon
the
head
of
his
compasses
,
with
one
foot
of
them
fixed
upon
Nevers
,
the
last
stage
he
had
paid
for
  
purposing
to
go
on
from
that
point
with
his
journey
and
calculation
,
as
soon
as
Obadiah
quitted
the
room
:
 
but
this
second
attack
of
Obadiah
's
,
in
opening
the
door
and
laying
the
whole
country
under
water
,
was
too
much
.
  
<EOS>
He
let
go
his
compasses
 
or
rather
with
a
mixed
motion
between
accident
and
anger
,
he
threw
them
upon
the
table
;
and
then
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
,
but
to
return
back
to
Calais
(
like
many
others
)
as
wise
as
he
had
set
out
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
letter
was
brought
into
the
parlour
,
which
contained
the
news
of
my
brother
's
death
,
my
father
had
got
forwards
again
upon
his
journey
to
within
a
stride
of
the
compasses
of
the
very
same
stage
of
Nevers
.
 
<EOS>
By
your
leave
,
Mons
.
<EOS>
Sanson
,
cried
my
father
,
striking
the
point
of
his
compasses
through
Nevers
into
the
table
 
and
nodding
to
my
uncle
Toby
to
see
what
was
in
the
letter
 
twice
of
one
night
,
is
too
much
for
an
English
gentleman
and
his
son
,
Mons
.
<EOS>
Sanson
,
to
be
turned
back
from
so
lousy
a
town
as
Nevers
  
<EOS>
What
think'st
thou
,
Toby
?
<EOS>
added
my
father
in
a
sprightly
tone
.
 
<EOS>
Unless
it
be
a
garrison
town
,
said
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
 
for
then
 
I
shall
be
a
fool
,
said
my
father
,
smiling
to
himself
,
as
long
as
I
live
.
 
<EOS>
So
giving
a
second
nod
  
and
keeping
his
compasses
still
upon
Nevers
with
one
hand
,
and
holding
his
book
of
the
post
-
roads
in
the
other
 
half
calculating
and
half
listening
,
he
leaned
forwards
upon
the
table
with
both
elbows
,
as
my
uncle
Toby
hummed
over
the
letter
.
  
<EOS>
.
<EOS>
.
<EOS>
.he
's
gone
!
<EOS>
said
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
Where
 
Who
?
cried
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
My
nephew
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
What
 
without
leave
 
without
money
 
without
governor
?
<EOS>
cried
my
father
in
amazement
.
 
<EOS>
No
:
 
<EOS>
he
is
dead
,
my
dear
brother
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
Without
being
ill
?
<EOS>
cried
my
father
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
not
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
in
a
low
voice
,
and
fetching
a
deep
sigh
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
,
he
has
been
ill
enough
,
poor
lad
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
answer
for
him
 
for
he
is
dead
.
  
<EOS>
When
Agrippina
was
told
of
her
son
's
death
,
Tacitus
informs
us
,
that
,
not
being
able
to
moderate
the
violence
of
her
passions
<EOS>
,
she
abruptly
broke
off
her
work
 
<EOS>
My
father
stuck
his
compasses
into
Nevers
,
but
so
much
the
faster
.
 
<EOS>
What
contrarieties
!
<EOS>
his
,
indeed
,
was
matter
of
calculation
!
  
<EOS>
Agrippina
's
must
have
been
quite
a
different
affair
;
who
else
could
pretend
to
reason
from
history
?
  
<EOS>
How
my
father
went
on
,
in
my
opinion
,
deserves
a
chapter
to
itself
.
      
<EOS>
.
.
.
 
<EOS>
And
a
chapter
it
shall
have
,
and
a
devil
of
a
one
too
 
so
look
to
yourselves
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis

Plato

Cardan

to

for
the
loss
of
our

Seneca

tells
us
somewhere
,
that
such

evacuate
themselves
best

<EOS>
My

managed
his
affliction
otherwise

and
indeed
differently
from
most
men
either
ancient
or
modern
;
for
he
neither
wept
it
away
,
as
the
Hebrews
and
the
Romans
 
or
slept
it
off
,
as
the
Laplanders
 
or
hanged
it
,
as
the
English
,

drowned
it

as

did
he
curse

excommunicate

<EOS>
He
got
rid

it

however

<EOS>
Will
your
worships
give
me
leave
to
squeeze
in
a
story
between
these
two
pages
?
  
<EOS>
When
Tully
was
bereft
of
his
dear
daughter
Tullia
,
at
first
he
laid
it
to
his
heart
,
 
he
listened
to
the
voice
of
nature
,
and
modulated
his
own
unto
it
.
 
<EOS>
O
my
Tullia
!
<EOS>
my
daughter
!
<EOS>
my
child
!
 
<EOS>
still
,
still
,
still
,
 
'
twas
<EOS>
O
my
Tullia
!
 
<EOS>
my
Tullia
!
 
<EOS>
Methinks
<EOS>
I
see
my
Tullia
<EOS>
,
I
hear
my
Tullia
,
I
talk
with
my
Tullia
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
soon
as
he
began
to
look
into
the
stores
of
philosophy
,
and
consider
how
many
excellent
things
might
be
said
upon
the
occasion
 
no
body
upon
earth
can
conceive
,
says
the
great
orator
,
how
happy
,
how
joyful
it
made
me
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
was
as
proud
of
his
eloquence
as
Marcus
Tullius
Cicero
could
be
for
his
life
,
and
,
for
aught
I
am
convinced
of
to
the
contrary
at
present
,
with
as
much
reason
:
 
<EOS>
it
was
indeed
his
strength
 
and
his
weakness
too
.
  
<EOS>
His
strength
 
<EOS>
for
he
was
by
nature
eloquent
;
and
his
weakness
 
for
<EOS>
he
was
hourly
a
dupe
to
it
;
and
,
provided
an
occasion
in
life
<EOS>
would
but
permit
him
to
shew
his
talents
,
or
say
either
a
wise
thing
,
a
witty
,
or
a
shrewd
one
  
(
bating
the
case
of
a
systematic
misfortune
)
 
<EOS>
he
had
all
he
wanted
.
 
<EOS>
A
blessing
which
tied
up
my
father
's
tongue
,
and
a
misfortune
which
let
it
loose
with
a
good
grace
,
were
pretty
equal
:
 
sometimes
,
indeed
,
the
misfortune
was
the
better
of
the
two
;
for
instance
,
where
the
pleasure
of
the
harangue
was
as
ten
,
and
the
pain
of
the
misfortune
<EOS>
but
as
five
 
my
father
gained
half
in
half
,
and
consequently
was
as
well
again
off
,
as
if
it
had
never
befallen
him
.
  
<EOS>
This
clue
will
unravel
what
otherwise
would
seem
very
inconsistent
in
my
father
's
domestic
character
;
and
it
is
this
,
that
,
in
the
provocations
arising
from
the
neglects
and
blunders
of
servants
,
or
other
mishaps
unavoidable
in
a
family
,
his
anger
,
or
rather
the
duration
of
it
,
eternally
ran
counter
to
all
conjecture
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
had
a
favourite
little
mare
,
which
he
had
consigned
over
to
a
most
beautiful
Arabian
horse
,
in
order
to
have
a
pad
out
of
her
for
his
own
riding
:
 
<EOS>
he
was
sanguine
in
all
his
projects
;
so
talked
about
his
pad
every
day
with
as
absolute
a
security
,
as
if
it
had
been
reared
,
broke
,
 
and
bridled
and
saddled
at
his
door
ready
for
mounting
.
 
<EOS>
By
some
neglect
or
other
in
Obadiah
,
it
so
fell
out
,
that
my
father
's
expectations
were
answered
with
nothing
better
than
a
mule
,
and
as
ugly
a
beast
of
the
kind
as
ever
was
produced
.
  
<EOS>
My
mother
and
my
uncle
Toby
expected
my
father
would
be
the
death
of
Obadiah
 
and
that
there
never
would
be
an
end
of
the
disaster
 
<EOS>
See
here
!
<EOS>
you
rascal
,
cried
my
father
,
pointing
to
the
mule
,
what
you
have
done
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
me
,
said
Obadiah
.
 
<EOS>
How
do
I
know
that
?
<EOS>
replied
my
father
.
  
<EOS>
Triumph
swam
in
my
father
's
eyes
,
at
the
repartee
 
the
Attic
salt
brought
water
into
them
 
and
so
Obadiah
heard
no
more
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
Now
let
us
go
back
to
my
brother
's
death
.
  
<EOS>

fine

For
Death
it

together

as
to
make
any

in
the
whole
pieces
of
antiquity
.
  
<EOS>
And
as
my
father
,
whilst
he
was
concerned
in
the
Turkey
trade
,
had
been
three
or
four
different
times
in
the
Levant
,
in
one
of
which
he
had
stayed
a
whole
year
and
an
half
at
Zant
,
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
naturally
concluded
,
that
,
in
some
one
of
these
periods
,
he
had
taken
a
trip
across
the
Archipelago
into
Asia
;
and
that
all
this
sailing
affair
with
Aegina
behind
,
and
Megara
before
,
and
Pyraeus
on
the
right
hand
,
&
c.
&
c.
was
nothing
more
than
the
true
course
of
my
father
's
voyage
and
reflections
.
 
<EOS>
'
Twas
certainly
in
his
manner
,
and
many
an
undertaking
critic
would
have
built
two
stories
higher
upon
worse
foundations
.
 
<EOS>
And
pray
,
brother
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
laying
the
end
of
his
pipe
upon
my
father
's
hand
in
a
kindly
way
of
interruption
 
but
waiting
till
he
finished
the
account
 
<EOS>
what
year
of
our
Lord
was
this
?
  
<EOS>
'
Twas
no
year
of
our
Lord
,
replied
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
impossible
,
cried
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
Simpleton

<EOS>
said
my
father
,
 
'
twas
forty
years
before
Christ
was
born
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
had
but
two
things
for
it
;
either
to
suppose
his
brother
to
be
the
wandering
Jew
,
or
that
his
misfortunes
had
disordered
his
brain
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
the
Lord
God
of
heaven
and
earth
protect
him
and
restore
him
!
"
<EOS>
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
praying
silently
for
my
father
,
and
with
tears
in
his
eyes
.
    
<EOS>
My
father
placed
the
tears
to
a
proper
account
,
and
went
on
with
his
harangue
with
great
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
not
such
great
odds
,
brother
Toby
,
betwixt
good
and
evil
,
as
the
world
imagines
"
 
(
this
way
of
setting
off
,
by
the
bye
,
was
not
likely
to
cure
my
uncle
Toby
's
suspicions
)
.
 
<EOS>
"
Labour
,
sorrow
,
grief
,
sickness

woe

<EOS>
Much
good
may
do
<EOS>
them
 
said
my
uncle
Toby
to
himself
.
    
<EOS>
"
My

my

and
feasted
and
made
merry
when

went
out

with

Death
opens
the

of
fame

shuts
the

of
envy
after
it

it
unlooses
the

of
the

puts
the

's

dreads
his

<EOS>
Is
it
not

,
my
dear
brother
Toby
,
(
for
mark
 
<EOS>
our
appetites
are

diseases

<EOS>
is
it
not

not
to
hunger

to
eat

not
to
thirst

to
take
physic
to
cure
it

<EOS>
Is
it
not

to
be
freed
from
cares
and
agues
,
from
love
and
melancholy

and
the

hot

<EOS>
There
is
no
terrour
,
brother
Toby
,
in
its
looks
,
but
what
it
borrows
from
groans
and
convulsions
 
and
the
blowing
of
noses

continued
my

,
smiling
,
for
he
had
absolutely
forgot
my

Bobby
 
'

<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
laid
down
his
pipe
to
consider
the
proposition
;
my
father
's
eloquence
was
too
rapid
to
stay
for
any
man
 
<EOS>
away
it
went
,
 
and
hurried
my
uncle
Toby
's
ideas
along
with
it
.
    
<EOS>
For
this
reason
,
continued
my
father
,
'
tis
worthy
to
recollect
,
how
little
alteration
,

<EOS>
'
Twas

said
my

.
      
<EOS>
And
lastly
 
for
all
the
choice
anecdotes
which
history
can
produce
of
this
matter
<EOS>
,
continued
my
father
,
 
<EOS>
this
,
like
the
gilded
dome
which
covers

crowns

<EOS>
@@@Tis

<EOS>

you

<EOS>
I
dare
say
<EOS>
I
have
not
,
replied
my
uncle
.
 
<EOS>
He
died
,
said
my
father
as
.
.
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
it
was
with
his
wife
,
said
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
there
could
be
no
hurt
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
That
's
more
than
I
know
 
<EOS>
replied
my
father
.
    
<EOS>
My
mother
was
going
very
gingerly
in
the
dark
along
the
passage
which
led
to
the
parlour
,
as
my
uncle
Toby
pronounced
the
word
wife
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
a
shrill
penetrating
sound
of
itself
,
and
Obadiah
had
helped
it
by
leaving
the
door
a
little
a
-
jar
,
so
that
my
mother
heard
enough
of
it
to
imagine
herself
the
subject
of
the
conversation
;
so
laying
the
edge
of
her
finger
across
her
two
lips
 
<EOS>
holding
in
her
breath
,
and
bending
her
head
a
little
downwards
,
with
a
twist
of
her
neck
 
(
not
towards
the
door
,
but
from
it
,
by
which
means
her
ear
was
brought
to
the
chink
)
 
<EOS>
she
listened
with
all
her
powers
:
 
<EOS>
the
listening
slave
,
with
the
Goddess
of
Silence
at
his
back
,
could
not
have
given
a
finer
thought
for
an
intaglio
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
attitude
I
am
determined
to
let
her
stand
for
five
minutes
:
 
<EOS>
till
I
bring
up
the
affairs
of
the
kitchen
(
as
Rapin
does
those
of
the
church
)
to
the
same
period
.
    
<EOS>
Though
in
one
sense
,
our
family
was
certainly
a
simple
machine
,
as
it
consisted
of
a
few
wheels
;
yet
there
was
thus
much
to
be
said
for
it
,
that
these
wheels
were
set
in
motion
by
so
many
different
springs
,
and
acted
one
upon
the
other
from
such
a
variety
of
strange
principles
and
impulses
 
that
though
it
was
a
simple
machine
,
it
had
all
the
honour
and
advantages
of
a
complex
one
,
 
and
a
number
of
as
odd
movements
within
it
,
as
ever
were
beheld
in
the
inside
of
a
Dutch
silk
-
mill
.
  
<EOS>
Amongst
these
there
was
one
,
I
am
going
to
speak
of
,
in
which
,
perhaps
,
it
was
not
altogether
so
singular
,
as
in
many
others
;
and
it
was
this
,
that
whatever
motion
,
debate
,
harangue
,
dialogue
,
project
,
or
dissertation
,
was
going
forwards
in
the
parlour
<EOS>
,
there
was
generally
another
at
the
same
time
,
and
upon
the
same
subject
,
running
parallel
along
with
it
in
the
kitchen
.
  
<EOS>
Now
to
bring
this
about
,
whenever
an
extraordinary
message
,
or
letter
,
was
delivered
in
the
parlour
 
or
a
discourse
suspended
till
a
servant
went
out
 
or
the
lines
of
discontent
were
observed
to
hang
upon
the
brows
of
my
father
or
mother
 
or
,
in
short
,
when
any
thing
was
supposed
to
be
upon
the
tapis
worth
knowing
or
listening
to
,
'
twas
the
rule
to
leave
the
door
,
not
absolutely
shut
,
but
somewhat
a
-
jar
 
<EOS>
as
it
stands
just
now
,
 
which
,
under
covert
of
the
bad
hinge
,
(
and
that
possibly
might
be
one
of
the
many
reasons
why
it
was
never
mended
,
)
<EOS>
it
was
not
difficult
to
manage
;
by
which
means
,
in
all
these
cases
,
a
passage
was
generally
left
,
not
indeed
as
wide
as
the
Dardanelles
,
but
wide
enough
,
for
all
that
,
to
carry
on
as
much
of
this
windward
trade
,
as
was
sufficient
to
save
my
father
the
trouble
of
governing
his
house
;
 
my
mother
at
this
moment
stands
profiting
by
it
.
  
<EOS>
Obadiah
did
the
same
thing
,
as
soon
as
he
had
left
the
letter
upon
the
table
which
brought
the
news
of
my
brother
's
death
,
so
that
before
my
father
had
well
got
over
his
surprise
,
and
entered
upon
his
harangue
,
 
had
Trim
got
upon
his
legs
,
to
speak
his
sentiments
upon
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
A
curious
observer
of
nature
,
had
he
been
worth
the
inventory
of
all
Job
's
stock
 
though
by
the
bye
,
your
curious
observers
are
seldom
worth
a
groat
  
<EOS>
would
have
given
the
half
of
it
,
to
have
heard
Corporal
Trim
and
my
father
,
two
orators
so
contrasted
by
nature
and
education
,
haranguing
over
the
same
bier
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
 
a
man
of
deep
reading
 
prompt
memory
 
with
Cato
,
and
Seneca
,
and
Epictetus
,
at
his
fingers
ends
.
    
<EOS>
The
corporal
 
with
nothing
 
to
remember
 
of
no
deeper
reading
than
his
muster
-
roll
 
or
greater
names
at
his
fingers
end
,
than
the
contents
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
one
proceeding
from
period
to
period
,
by
metaphor
and
allusion
,
and
striking
the
fancy
as
he
went
along
(
as
men
of
wit
and
fancy
do
)
with
the
entertainment
and
pleasantry
of
his
pictures
and
images
.
  
<EOS>
The
other
,
without
wit
or
antithesis
,
or
point
,
or
turn
,
this
way
or
that
;
but
leaving
the
images
on
one
side
,
and
the
picture
on
the
other
,
going
straight
forwards
as
nature
could
lead
him
,
to
the
heart
.
 
<EOS>
O
Trim

would
to

had'st

<EOS>
My
young
master
in
London
is
dead
?
<EOS>
said
Obadiah
.
      
<EOS>
A
green
sattin
night
-
gown
of
my
mother
's
,
which
had
been
twice
scoured
,
was
the
first
idea
which
Obadiah
's
exclamation
brought
into
Susannah
's
head
.
 
<EOS>
Well
might
Locke
write
a
chapter
upon
the
imperfections
of
words
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
quoth
Susannah
,
we
must
all
go
into
mourning
.
 
<EOS>
But
note
a
second
time
:
 
the
word
mourning
,
notwithstanding
Susannah
made
use
of
it
<EOS>
herself
  
failed
also
of
doing
its
office
;
it
excited
<EOS>
not
one
single
idea
,
tinged
either
with
grey
or
black
,
 
all
was
green
.
 
<EOS>
The
green
sattin
night
-
gown
hung
there
still
.
    
<EOS>
O
!
'
<EOS>
twill
be
the
death
of
my
poor
mistress
,
cried
Susannah
.
 
<EOS>
My
mother
's
whole
wardrobe
followed
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
procession
!
<EOS>
her
red
damask
,
 
her
orange
tawney
,
 
her
white

yellow
lutestrings

her

taffata

her

Not
a

was
left
behind
.
 
<EOS>
"
No

she
will
never
look
up
again

said
Susannah
.
  
<EOS>
We
had
a
fat
,
foolish
scullion
 
<EOS>
my
father
,
I
think
,
kept
her
for
her
simplicity
;
 
she
had
been
all
autumn
struggling
with
a
dropsy
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
dead
,
said
Obadiah
,
 
he
is
certainly
dead
!
 
<EOS>
So
am
not
I

said
the
foolish
scullion
.
    
<EOS>
Here
is
sad
news
,
Trim
,
cried
Susannah
,
wiping
her
eyes
as
Trim
stepp'd
into
the
kitchen
,
 
<EOS>
master
Bobby
is
dead
and
buried
 
<EOS>
the
funeral
was
an
interpolation
of
Susannah
's
 
we
shall
have
all
to
go
into
mourning
,
said
Susannah
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
not
,
said
Trim
.
 
<EOS>
You
hope
not
!
<EOS>
cried
Susannah
earnestly
.
 
<EOS>
The
mourning
ran
not
in
Trim
's
head
,
whatever
it
did
in
Susannah
's
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
  
said
Trim
,
<EOS>
explaining
himself
,
I
hope
in
God
the
news
is
not
true
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
the
letter
read
with
my
own
ears
,
answered
Obadiah
;
and
we
shall
have
a
terrible
piece
of
work
of
it
in
stubbing
the
ox
-
moor
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
he
's
dead
,
said
Susannah
.
 
<EOS>
As
sure
,
said
the
scullion
,
as
I
'm
alive
.
  
<EOS>
I
lament
for
him
from
my
heart
and
my
soul
,
said
Trim
,
fetching
a
sigh
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
creature
!
 
<EOS>
poor
boy
!
 
<EOS>
poor
gentleman
!
    
<EOS>
He
was
alive
last
Whitsontide

<EOS>
said
the
coachman
.
 
<EOS>
Whitsontide

<EOS>
alas

<EOS>
cried
Trim
,
extending
his
right
arm
,
and
falling
instantly
into
the
same
attitude
in
which
he
read

what
is
Whitsontide

Jonathan

for
that
was
the
coachman
's
name
)
,
or
Shrovetide
,
or
any
tide
or
time
past
,
to
this
?
 
<EOS>
Are
we
not
here
now
,
continued
the
corporal
(
striking
the
end
of
his
stick
perpendicularly
upon
the
floor
,
so
as
to
give
an
idea
of
health
and
stability
)
 
and
are
we
not
 
(
dropping
his
hat
upon
the
ground
)
gone
!
<EOS>
in
a
moment
!
 
<EOS>
'
Twas
infinitely
striking
!
 
<EOS>
Susannah
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
not
stocks
and
stones
.
 
<EOS>
Jonathan
,
Obadiah
,
the
cook
-
maid
,
all
melted
.
 
<EOS>
The
foolish
fat
scullion
herself
,
who
was
scouring
a
fish
-
kettle
upon
her
knees
,
was
rous'd
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
kitchen
crowded
about
the
corporal
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
as
I
perceive
plainly
,
that
the
preservation
of
our
constitution
in
church
and
state
,
 
and
possibly
the
preservation
of
the
whole
world
 
or
what
is
the
same
thing
,
the
distribution
and
balance
of
its
property
and
power
,
may
in
time
to
come
depend
greatly
upon
the
right
understanding
of
this
stroke
of
the
corporal
's
eloquence
 
<EOS>
I
do
demand
your
attention
 
your
worships
and
reverences
,
for
any
ten
pages
together
,
take
them
where
you
will
in
any
other
part
of
the
work
,
<EOS>
shall
sleep
for
it
at
your
ease
.
  
<EOS>
I
said
,
"
we
were
not
stocks
and
stones
"
 
'
tis
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
added
,
nor
are
we
angels
<EOS>
,
I
wish
we
were
,
 
but
men
clothed
with
bodies
,
and
governed
by
our
imaginations
;
 
and
what
a
junketing
piece
of
work
of
it
<EOS>
there
is
,
betwixt
these
and
our
seven
senses
,
especially
some
of
them
,
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
own
it
,
I
am
ashamed
to
confess
.
 
<EOS>
Let
it
suffice
to
affirm
,
that
of
all
the
senses
,
the
eye
(
for
I
absolutely
deny
the
touch
,
though
most
of
your
Barbati
,
I
know
,
are
for
it
)
has
the
quickest
commerce
with
the
soul
,
 
gives
a
smarter
stroke
,
and
leaves
something
more
inexpressible
upon
the
fancy
,
than
words
can
either
convey
 
or
sometimes
get
rid
of
.
    
<EOS>
I
've
gone
a
little
about
 
<EOS>
no
matter
,
'
tis
for
health
 
let
us
only
carry
it
back
in
our
mind
to
the
mortality
of
Trim
's
hat
 
<EOS>
"
Are
we
not
here
now
,
  
and
gone
in
a
moment
?
"
 
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
in
the
sentence
 
<EOS>
'
twas
one
of
your
self
-
evident
truths
<EOS>
we
have
the
advantage
of
hearing
every
day
;
and
if
Trim
had
not
trusted
more
to
his
hat
than
his
head
 
he
made
nothing
at
all
of
it
.
    
<EOS>
"
Are
we
not
here
now
;
"
continued
the
corporal
,
"
and
are
we
not
"
  
(
dropping
his
hat
plumb
upon
the
ground
 
and
pausing
,
before
he
pronounced
the
word
)
 
<EOS>
"
gone
!
<EOS>
in
a
moment
?
"
 
<EOS>
The
descent
of
the
hat
was
as
if
a
heavy
lump
of
clay
had
been
kneaded
into
the
crown
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
could
have
expressed
the
sentiment
of
mortality
,
of
which
it
was
the
type
and
fore-
runner
,
like
it
,
 
his
hand
seemed
to
vanish
from
under
it
,
 
it
fell
dead
,
  
the
corporal
's
eye
fixed
upon
it
,
as
upon
a
corpse
,
 
and
Susannah
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
.
  
<EOS>
Now
 
Ten
thousand
,
and
ten
thousand
times
ten
thousand
(
for
matter
and
motion
are
infinite
)
are
the
ways
by
which
a
hat
may
be
dropped
upon
the
ground
,
without
any
effect
.
 
<EOS>
Had
he
flung
it
,
or
thrown
it
,
or
cast
it
,
or
skimmed
it
,
or
squirted
it
,
or
let
it
slip
or
fall
in
any
possible
direction
under
heaven
,
 
or
in
the
best
direction
that
could
be
given
to
it
<EOS>
,
 
had
he
dropped
it
like
a
goose
 
like
a
puppy
 
like
an
ass
 
or
in
doing
it
,
or
even
after
he
had
done
,
had
he
looked
like
a
fool
 
like
a
ninny
  
like
a
nincompoop
 
it
had
fail'd
,
and
the
effect
upon
the
heart
had
been
lost
.
  
<EOS>
Ye
who
govern
this
mighty
world
and
its
mighty
concerns
with
the
engines
of
eloquence
,
 
who
heat
it
,
and
cool
it
,
and
melt
it
,
and
mollify
it
,
 
and
then
harden
it
again
to
your
purpose
    
Ye
who
wind
and
turn
the
passions
with
this
great
windlass
,
and
,
having
done
it
,
lead
the
owners
of
them

whither
ye

<EOS>
Ye

lastly
,
who
drive
 
and
why

Ye
also
who
are
driven
,
like
turkeys

red
clout
 
meditate
 
meditate
,
I
beseech
you
,
upon
Trim
's
hat
.
    
<EOS>
Stay
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
small
account
to
settle
with
the
reader
before
Trim
can
go
on
with
his
harangue
.
 
<EOS>
It
shall
be
done
in
two
minutes
.
  
<EOS>
Amongst
many
other
book
-
debts
,
all
of
which
I
shall
discharge
in
due
time
,
 
I
own
myself
a
debtor
to
the
world
for
two
items
,
 
a
chapter
upon
chamber-
maids
and
button
-
holes
,
which
,
in
the
former
part
of
my
work
,
I
promised
and
fully
intended
to
pay
off
this
year
:
 
but
some
of
your
worships
and
reverences
telling
me
,
that
the
two
subjects
,
especially
so
connected
together
,
might
endanger
the
morals
of
the
world
,
 
<EOS>
I
pray
the
chapter
upon
chamber
-
maids
and
button
-
holes
may
be
forgiven
me
,
 
and
that
they
will
accept
of
the
last
chapter
in
lieu
of
it
;
which
is
nothing
,
<EOS>
an't
please
your
reverences
,
but
a
chapter
of
chamber
-
maids
,
green
gowns
,
and
old
hats
.
  
<EOS>
Trim
took
his
hat
off
the
ground
,
 
put
it
upon
his
head
,
 
and
then
went
on
with
his
oration
upon
death
,
in
manner
and
form
following
.
      
<EOS>
To
us
,
Jonathan
,
who
know
not
what
want
or
care
<EOS>
is
 
who
live
here
in
the
service
of
two
of
the
best
of
masters
 
<EOS>
(
bating
in
my
own
case
his
majesty
King
William
the
Third
,
whom
I
had
the
honour
to
serve
both
in
Ireland
and
Flanders
)
 
<EOS>
I
own
it
,
that
from
Whitsontide
to
within
three
weeks
of
Christmas
,
 
'
tis
not
long
 
'
tis
like
nothing
;
 
but
to
those
,
Jonathan
,
who
know
what
death
is
,
and
what
havock
and
destruction
he
can
make
,
before
a
man
can
well
wheel
about
 
'
tis
like
a
whole
age
.
 
<EOS>
O
Jonathan
!
<EOS>
"
twould
make
a
good
-
natured
man
's
heart
bleed
,
to
consider
,
continued
the
corporal
(
standing
perpendicularly
)
,
how
low
many
a
brave
and
upright
fellow
has
been
laid
since
that
time
!
 
<EOS>
And
trust
me
,
Susy
,
added
the
corporal
,
turning
to
Susannah
,
whose
eyes
were
swimming
in
water
,
 
before
that
time
comes
round
again
,
 
many
a
bright
eye
will
be
dim
.
 
<EOS>
Susannah
placed
it
to
the
right
side
of
the
page
 
<EOS>
she
wept
 
<EOS>
but
she
court'sied
too
.
 
<EOS>
Are
we
not
,
continued
Trim
,
<EOS>
looking
still
at
Susannah
 
are
we
not
like
a
flower
of
the
field
 
a
tear
of
pride
stole
in
betwixt
<EOS>
every
two
tears
of
humiliation
  
else
no
tongue
could
have
described
Susannah
's
affliction
 
is
not
all
flesh
grass
?
 
<EOS>
Tis
clay
,
 
'
tis
dirt
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
looked
directly
at
the
scullion
,
  
the
scullion
had
just
been
scouring
a
fish
-
kettle
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
fair
.
      
<EOS>
What
is
the
finest
face
that
ever
man
looked
at
!
 
<EOS>
I
could
hear
Trim
talk
so
for
ever
,
cried
Susannah
,
 
<EOS>
what
is
it
!
<EOS>
(
Susannah
laid
her
hand
upon
Trim
's
shoulder
)
 
but
corruption
?
 
<EOS>
Susannah
took
it
off
.
  
<EOS>
Now
I
love
you
for
this
 
and
'
tis
this
delicious
mixture
within
you
which
makes
you
dear
creatures
<EOS>
what
you
are
 
and
he
who
hates
you
for
it
 
all
I
can
say
of
the
matter
is
 
That
he
has
either
a
pumpkin
for
his
head
 
or
a
pippin
for
his
heart
,
 
and
whenever
he
is
dissected
'
twill
be
found
so
.
    
<EOS>
Whether
Susannah
,
by
taking
her
hand
too
suddenly
from
off
the
corporal
's
shoulder
(
by
the
whisking
about
of
her
passions
)
 
broke
a
little
the
chain
of
his
reflexions
    
Or
whether
the
corporal
began
to
be
suspicious
,
he
had
got
into
the
doctor
's
quarters
,
and
was
talking
more
like
the
chaplain
than
himself
    
Or
whether
.
.
<EOS>
.Or
<EOS>
whether
 
for
in
all
such
cases
<EOS>
a
man
of
invention
and
parts
may
with
pleasure
fill
a
couple
of
pages
with
suppositions
 
which
of
all
these
was
the
cause
,
let
the
curious
physiologist
,
or
the
curious
any
body
determine
 
'
tis
certain
,
at
least
,
the
corporal
went
on
thus
with
his
harangue
.
  
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
declare
it
,
that
out
of
doors
,
I
value
not
death
at
all
:
 
not
this
.
.
<EOS>
.added
<EOS>
the
corporal
,
snapping
his
fingers
,
 
but
with
an
air
which
no
one
but
the
corporal
could
have
given
to
the
sentiment
.
 
<EOS>
In
battle
,
I
value
death
not
this
.
.
<EOS>
.and
<EOS>
let
him
not
take
me
cowardly
,
like
poor
Joe
Gibbins
,
in
scouring
his
gun
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
he
?
 
<EOS>
A
pull
of
a
trigger
 
a
push
of
a
bayonet
an
inch
this
way
or
that
 
makes
the
difference
.
 
<EOS>
Look
along
the
line
 
to
the
right
 
see
!
 
<EOS>
Jack
's
down
!
<EOS>
well
,
 
'
tis
worth
a
regiment
of
horse
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
No
 
'
tis
Dick
.
 
<EOS>
Then
Jack
's
no
worse
.
 
<EOS>
Never
mind
which
,
 
we
pass
on
,
 
in
hot
pursuit
the
wound
itself
which
brings
him
is
not
felt
,
 
the
best
way
is
to
stand
up
to
him
,
 
the
man
who
flies
,
is
in
ten
times
more
danger
than
the
man
who
marches
up
into
his
jaws
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
look'd
<EOS>
him
,
added
the
corporal
,
an
hundred
times
in
the
face
,
 
and
know
what
he
is
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
nothing
,
Obadiah
,
at
all
in
the
field
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
's
very
frightful
in
a
house
,
quoth
Obadiah
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
mind
it
myself
,
said
Jonathan
,
upon
a
coach
-
box
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
,
in
my
opinion
,
be
most
natural
in
bed
,
replied
Susannah
.
 
<EOS>
And
could
I
escape
him
by
creeping
into
the
worst
calf
's
skin
that
ever
was
made
into
a
knapsack
<EOS>
,
I
would
do
it
there
 
said
Trim
 
<EOS>
but
that
is
nature
.
    
<EOS>
Nature
is
nature
,
said
Jonathan
.
 
<EOS>
And
that
is
the
reason
,
cried
Susannah
,
<EOS>
I
so
much
pity
<EOS>
my
mistress
.
 
<EOS>
She
will
never
get
the
better
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Now
I
pity
the
captain
the
most
of
any
one
in
the
family
,
answered
Trim
.
 
<EOS>
Madam
will
get
ease
of
heart
in
weeping
,
 
and
the
Squire
in
talking
about
it
,
  
but
my
poor
master
will
keep
it
all
in
silence
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
hear
him
sigh
in
his
bed
for
a
whole
month
together
,
as
he
did
for
lieutenant
Le
Fever
.
 
<EOS>
An
'
please
your
honour
,
do
not
sigh
so
piteously
,
I
would
say
to
him
as
I
laid
besides
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
it
,
Trim
,
my
master
would
say
,
  
'
<EOS>
tis
so
melancholy
an
accident
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
get
it
off
my
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Your
honour
fears
not
death
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
,
Trim
<EOS>
,
I
fear
nothing
,
he
would
say
,
but
the
doing
a
wrong
thing
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
he
would
add
,
whatever
betides
,
I
will
take
care
of
Le
Fever
's
boy
.
 
<EOS>
And
with
that
,
like
a
quieting
draught
,
his
honour
would
fall
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
I
like
to
hear
Trim
's
stories
about
the
captain
,
said
Susannah
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
kindly
-
hearted
gentleman
,
said
Obadiah
,
as
ever
lived
.
 
<EOS>
Aye
,
and
as
brave
a
one
too
,
said
the
corporal
,
as
ever
stept
before
a
platoon
.
 
<EOS>
There
never
was
a
better
officer
in
the
king
's
army
,
 
or
a
better
man
in
God
's
world
;
for
he
would
march
up
to
the
mouth
of
a
cannon
,
though
he
saw
the
lighted
match
at
the
very
touch
-
hole
,
 
and
yet
,
for
all
that
,
he
has
a
heart
as
soft
as
a
child
for
other
people
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
not
hurt
a
chicken
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
sooner
,
quoth
Jonathan
,
drive
such
a
gentleman
for
seven
pounds
a
year
  
than
some
for
eight
.
 
<EOS>
Thank
thee
,
Jonathan
!
<EOS>
for
thy
twenty
shillings
,
 
as
much
,
Jonathan
,
said
the
corporal
,
shaking
him
by
the
hand
,
as
if
thou
hadst
put
the
money
into
my
own
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
serve
him
to
the
day
of
my
death
out
of
love
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
friend
and
a
brother
to
me
,
 
and
could
I
be
sure
my
poor
brother
<EOS>
Tom
was
dead
,
 
continued
the
corporal
,
taking
out
his
handkerchief
,
 
was
I
worth
ten
thousand
pounds
,
I
would
leave
every
shilling
of
it
to
the
captain
.
 
<EOS>
Trim
could
not
refrain
from
tears
at
this
testamentary
proof
he
gave
of
his
affection
to
his
master
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
kitchen
was
affected
.
 
<EOS>
Do
tell
us
the
story
of
the
poor
lieutenant
,
said

With
all
my
heart
,
answered
the
corporal
.
  
<EOS>
Susannah
,
the
cook
,
Jonathan
,
Obadiah
,
and
corporal
Trim
,
formed
a
circle
about
the
fire
;
and
as
soon
as
the
scullion
had
shut
the
kitchen
door
,
 
the
corporal
begun
.
    
<EOS>
I
am
a
Turk
<EOS>
if
I
had
not
as
much
forgot
my
mother
,
as
if
Nature
had
plaistered
me
up
,
and
set
me
down
naked
upon
the
banks
of
the
river
Nile
,
without
one
.
 
<EOS>
Your
most
obedient
servant
,
Madam
 
<EOS>
I
've
cost
you
a
great
deal
of
trouble
,
 
<EOS>
I
wish
it
may
answer
;
 
but
you
have
left
a
crack
in
my
back
,
  
and
here
's
a
great
piece
fallen
off
here
before
,
 
and
what
must
I
do
with
this
foot
?
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
reach
England
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
never
wonder
at
any
thing
;
 
and
so
often
has
my
judgment
deceived
me
in
my
life
,
that
I
always
suspect
it
,
right
or
wrong
,
 
at
least
I
am
seldom
hot
upon
cold
subjects
.
 
<EOS>
For
all
this
,
I
reverence
truth
as
much
as
any
body
;
and
when
it
has
slipped
us
,
if
a
man
will
but
take
me
by
the
hand
,
and
go
quietly
and
search
for
it
,
as
for
a
thing
we
have
both
lost
,
and
can
neither
of
us
do
well
without
,
 
<EOS>
I
'll
go
to
the
world
's
end
with
him
:
 
<EOS>
But
I
hate
disputes
,
 
and
therefore
(
bating
religious
points
,
or
such
as
touch
society
)
I
would
almost
subscribe
to
any
thing
which
does
not
choak
me
in
the
first
passage
,
rather
than
be
drawn
into
one
 
<EOS>
But
I
can
not
bear
suffocation
,
 
and
bad
smells
worst
of
all
.
 
<EOS>
For
which
reasons
,
I
resolved
from
the
beginning
,
That
if
ever
the
army
of
martyrs
was
to
be
augmented
,
 
or
a
new
one
raised
,
 
I
would
have
no
hand
in
it
,
one
way
or
t'other
.
      
<EOS>
But
to
return
to
my
mother
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
's
opinion
,
Madam
,
"
that
there
could
be
no
harm
in
Cornelius
Gallus
,
the
Roman
praetor
's
lying
with
his
wife
;
"
 
or
rather
the
last
word
of
that
opinion
,
 
<EOS>
(
for
it
was
all
my
mother
heard
of
it
)
<EOS>
caught
hold
of
her
by
the
weak
part
of
the
whole
sex
:
 
<EOS>
You
shall
not
mistake
me
,
 
<EOS>
I
mean
her
curiosity
,
 
she
instantly
concluded
herself
the
subject
of
the
conversation
,
and
with
that
prepossession
upon
her
fancy
,
you
will
readily
conceive
every
word
my
father
said
,
was
accommodated
either
to
herself
,
or
her
family
concerns
.
    
<EOS>
Pray
,
Madam
,
in
what
street
does
the
lady
live
,
who
would
not
have
done
the
same
?
  
<EOS>
From
the
strange
mode
of
Cornelius
's
death
,
my
father
had
made
a
transition
to
that
of
Socrates
,
and
was
giving
my
uncle
Toby
an
abstract
of
his
pleading
before
his
judges
;
 
'
twas
irresistible
:
 
not
the
oration
of
Socrates
,
 
but
my
father
's
temptation
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
wrote
the
Life
of
Socrates
(
This
book
my
father
would
never
consent
to
publish
;
'
tis
in
manuscript
,
with
some
other
tracts
of
his
,
in
the
family
,
all
,
or
most
of
which
will
be
printed
in
due
time
.
)
<EOS>
himself
the
year
before
he
left
off
trade
,
which
,
I
fear
,
was
the
means
of
hastening
him
out
of
it
;
 
so
that
no
one
was
able
to
set
out
with
so
full
a
sail
,
and
in
so
swelling
a
tide
of
heroic
loftiness
upon
the
occasion
,
as
my
father
was
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
period
in
Socrates
's
oration
,
which
closed
with
a
shorter
word
than
transmigration
,
or
annihilation
,
 
or
a
worse
thought
in
the
middle
of
it
than
to
be
 
or
not
to
be
,
 
the
entering
upon
a
new
and
untried
state
of
things
,
 
or
,
upon
a
long
,
a
profound
and
peaceful
sleep
,
without
dreams
,
without
disturbance
?
  
<EOS>
That
we
and
our
children
were
born
to
die
,
 
but
neither
of
us
born
to
be
slaves
.
 
<EOS>
No
 
<EOS>
there
I
mistake
;
that
was
part
of
Eleazer
's
oration
,
as
recorded
by
Josephus
(
de
Bell
.
<EOS>
Judaic
)
 
<EOS>
Eleazer
owns
he
had
it
from
the
philosophers
of
India
;
in
all
likelihood
Alexander
the
Great
,
in
his
irruption
into
India
,
after
he
had
over
-
run
Persia
,
amongst
the
many
things
he
stole
,
 
stole
that
sentiment
also
;
by
which
means
it
was
carried
,
<EOS>
if
not
all
the
way
by
himself
(
for
we
all
know
he
died
at
Babylon
)
,
at
least
by
some
of
his
maroders
,
into
Greece
,
 
from
Greece
it
got
to
Rome
,
 
from
Rome
to
France
,
 
and
from
France
to
England
:
 
<EOS>
So
things
come
round
.
    
<EOS>
By
land
carriage
,
I
can
conceive
no
other
way
.
    
<EOS>
By
water
the
sentiment
might
easily
have
come
down
the
Ganges
into
the
Sinus
Gangeticus
,
or
Bay
of
Bengal
,
and
so
into
the
Indian
Sea
;
and
following
the
course
of
trade
(
the
way
from
India
by
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope
being
then
unknown
)
,
might
be
carried
with
other
drugs
and
spices
up
the
Red
Sea
to
Joddah
,
the
port
of
Mekka
,
or
else
to
Tor
or
Sues
,
towns
at
the
bottom
of
the
gulf
;
and
from
thence
by
karrawans
to
Coptos
,
but
three
days
journey
distant
,
so
down
the
Nile
directly
to
Alexandria
,
where
the
Sentiment
would
be
landed
at
the
very
foot
of
the
great
stair
-
case
of
the
Alexandrian
library
,
 
and
from
that
store
-
house
it
would
be
fetched
.
 
<EOS>
Bless
me
!
<EOS>
what
a
trade
was
driven
by
the
learned
in
those
days
!
      
<EOS>
Now
my
father
had
a
way
,
a
little
like
that
of
Job
's
(
in
case
<EOS>
there
ever
was
such
a
man
 
<EOS>
if
not
,
there
's
an
end
of
the
matter
.
    
<EOS>
Though
,
by
the
bye
,
because
your
learned
men
find
some
difficulty
in
fixing
the
precise
aera
in
which
so
great
a
man
lived
;
 
whether
,
for
instance
,
before
or
after
the
patriarchs
,
&
c.
 
to
vote
,
therefore
,
that
he
never
lived
at
all
,
is
a
little
cruel
,
 
'
tis
not
doing
as
they
would
be
done
by
<EOS>
,
 
happen
that
as
it
may
)
 
<EOS>
My
father
,
I
say
,
had
a
way
,
when
things
went
extremely
wrong
with
him
,
especially
upon
the
first
sally
of
his
impatience
,
 
of
wondering
why
he
was
begot
,
 
wishing
himself
dead
;
  
sometimes
worse
:
 
<EOS>
And
when
the
provocation
ran
high
,
and
grief
touched
his
lips
with
more
than
ordinary
powers
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
you
scarce
could
have
distinguished
him
from
Socrates
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Every
word
would
breathe
the
sentiments
of
a
soul
disdaining
life
,
and
careless
about
all
its
issues
;
for
which
reason
,
though
my
mother
was
a
woman
of
no
deep
reading
,
yet
the
abstract
of
Socrates
's
oration
,
which
my
father
was
giving
my
uncle
Toby
,
was
not
altogether
new
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
listened
to
it
with
composed
intelligence
,
and
would
have
done
so
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
,
<EOS>
had
not
my
father
plunged
(
which
he
had
no
occasion
to
have
done
)
into
that
part
of
the
pleading
where
the
great
philosopher
reckons
up
his
connections
,
his
alliances
,
and
children
;
but
renounces
a
security
to
be
so
won
by
working
upon
the
passions
of
his
judges
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
friends
 
<EOS>
I
have
relations
,
 
<EOS>
I
have
three
desolate
children
,
"
 
says
Socrates
.
      
<EOS>
Then
,
cried
my
mother
,
opening
the
door
<EOS>
,
 
you
have
one
more
,
Mr.
Shandy
,
than
I
know
of
.
  
<EOS>
By
heaven
!
<EOS>
I
have
one
less
,
 
said
my
father
,
getting
up
and
walking
out
of
the
room
.
      
<EOS>
They
are
Socrates
's
children
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
been
dead
a
hundred
years
ago
,
replied
my
mother
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
was
no
chronologer
 
so
not
caring
to
advance
one
step
but
upon
safe
ground
,
he
laid
down
his
pipe
deliberately
upon
the
table
,
and
rising
up
,
and
taking
my
mother
most
kindly
by
the
hand
,
without
saying
another
word
,
either
good
or
bad
,
to
her
,
he
led
her
out
after
my
father
,
that
he
might
finish
the
ecclaircissement
himself
.
    
<EOS>
Had
this
volume
been
a
farce
,
which
,
unless
every
one
's
life
and
opinions
are
to
be
looked
upon
as
a
farce
as
well
as
mine
,
I
see
no
reason
to
suppose
 
the
last
chapter
,
Sir
,
had
finished
the
first
act
of
it
,
and
then
this

must
have
set

The
first
thing
which
entered
my
father
's
head
,
after
affairs
were
a
little
settled
in
the
family
,
and
<EOS>
Susanna
had
got
possession
of
my
mother
's
green
sattin
night
-
gown
,
 
was
to
sit
down
coolly
,
after
the
example
of
Xenophon
,
and
write
a
Tristra
-
paedia
,
or
system
of
education
for
me
;
collecting
first
for
that
purpose
his
own
scattered
thoughts
,
counsels
,
and
notions
;
and
binding
them
together
,
so
as
to
form
an
Institute
for
the
government
of
my
childhood
and
adolescence
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
my
father
's
last
stake
 
<EOS>
he
had
lost
my
brother
Bobby
entirely
,
 
he
had
lost
,
by
his
own
computation
,
full
three-
fourths
of
me
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
he
had
been
unfortunate
in
his
three
first
great
casts
for
me
 
my
geniture
,
nose
,
and
name
,
 
there
was
<EOS>
but
this
one
left
;
and
accordingly
my
father
gave
himself
up
to
it
with
as
much
devotion
as
ever
my
uncle
Toby
had
done
to
his
doctrine
of
projectils
.
 
<EOS>
The
difference
between
them
was
,
that
my
uncle
Toby
drew
his
whole
knowledge
of
projectils
from
Nicholas
Tartaglia
 
<EOS>
My
father
spun
his
,
every
thread
of
it
,
out
of
his
own
brain
,
 
or
reeled
and
cross
-
twisted
what
all
other
spinners
and
spinsters
had
spun
before
him
,
that
'
twas
pretty
near
the
same
torture
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
In
about
three
years
,
or
something
more
,
my
father
had
got
advanced
almost
into
the
middle
of
his
work
.
 
<EOS>
Like
all
other
writers
,
he
met
with
disappointments
.
 
<EOS>
He
imagined
he
should
be
able
to
bring
whatever
he
had
to
say
,
into
so
small
a
compass
,
that
when
it
was
finished
and
bound
,
it
might
be
rolled
up
in
my
mother
's
hussive
.
 
<EOS>
Matter

<EOS>
Let
no
man
say
,
 
"
Come
 
<EOS>
I
'll
write
a
duodecimo
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
My
father
gave
himself
up
to
it
,
however
,
with
the
most
painful
diligence
,
proceeding
step
by
step
in
every
line
,
with
the
same
kind
of
caution
and
circumspection
(
though
I
can
not
say
upon
quite
so
religious
a
principle
)
as
was
used
by
John
de
la
Casse
,
the
lord
archbishop
of
Benevento
,
in
compassing
his
Galatea
;
in
which
his
Grace
of
Benevento
spent
near
forty
years
of
his
life
;
and
when
the
thing
came
out
,
it
was
not
of
above
half
the
size
or
the
thickness
of
a
Rider
's
Almanack
.
 
<EOS>
How
the
holy
man
managed
the
affair
,
unless
he
spent
the
greatest
part
of
his
time
in
combing
his
whiskers
,
or
playing
at
primero
with
his
chaplain
,
 
would
pose
any
mortal
not
let
into
the
true
secret
;
 
and
therefore
'
tis
worth
explaining
to
the
world
,
was
it
only
for
the
encouragement
of
those
few
in
it
,
who
write
not
so
much
to
be
fed
 
as
to
be
famous
.
  
<EOS>
I
own
had
John
de
la
Casse
,
the
archbishop
of
Benevento
,
for
whose
memory
(
<EOS>
notwithstanding
his
Galatea
,
)
I
retain
the
highest
veneration
,
 
had
he
been
,
Sir
,
a
slender
clerk
 
of
dull
wit
 
slow
parts
 
costive
head
,
and
<EOS>
so
forth
,
 
he
and
his
Galatea
might
have
jogged
on
together
to
the
age
of
Methuselah
for
me
,
 
the
phaenomenon
had
not
been
worth
a
parenthesis
.
    
<EOS>
But
the
reverse
of
this
was
the
truth
:
 
<EOS>
John
de
la
Casse
was
a
genius
of
fine
parts
and
fertile
fancy
;
and
yet
with
all
these
great
advantages
of
nature
,
which
should
have
pricked
him
forwards
with
his
Galatea
,
he
lay
under
an
impuissance
at
the
same
time
of
advancing
above
a
line
and
a
half
in
the
compass
of
a
whole
summer
's
day
:
 
<EOS>
this
disability
in
his
Grace
arose
from
an
opinion
he
was
afflicted
with
,
 
<EOS>
which
opinion
was
this
,
 
viz
.
<EOS>
that
whenever
a
Christian
was
writing
a
book
(
not
for
his
private
amusement
,
but
)
where
his
intent
and
purpose
was
,
bona
fide
,
to
print
and
publish
it
to
the
world
,
his
first
thoughts
were
always
the
temptations
of
the
evil
one
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
the
state
of
ordinary
writers
:
 
but
when
a
personage
of
venerable
character
and
high
station
,
either
in
church
or
state
,
once
turned
author
,
 
he
maintained
,
that
from
the
very
moment
he
took
pen
in
hand
 
all
the
devils
in
hell
broke
out
of
their
holes
to
cajole
him
.
 
<EOS>
'
Twas
Term
-
time
with
them
,
 
every
thought
,
first
and
last
,
was
captious
;
 
how
specious
and
good
soever
,
 
'
twas
all
one
;
 
in
whatever
form
or
colour
<EOS>
it
presented
itself
to
the
imagination
,
 
'
twas
still
a
stroke
of
one
or
other
of
'em
levell'd
at
him
,
and
was
to
be
fenced
off
.
 
<EOS>
So
that
the
life
of
a
writer
,
whatever
he
might
fancy
to
the
contrary
,
was
not
so
much
a
state
of
composition
,
as
a
state
of
warfare
;
and
his
probation
in
it
,
precisely
that
of
any
other
man
militant
upon
earth
,
 
both
depending
alike
,
not
half
so
much
upon
the
degrees
of
his
wit
 
as
his
Resistance
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
was
hugely
pleased
with
this
theory
of
John
de
la
Casse
,
archbishop
of
Benevento
;
and
(
had
it
not
cramped
him
a
little
in
his
creed
)
<EOS>
I
believe
would
have
given
ten
of
the
best
acres
in
the
Shandy
estate
,
to
have
been
the
broacher
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
How
far
my
father
actually
believed
in
the
devil
,
will
be
seen
,
when
I
come
to
speak
of
my
father
's
religious
notions
,
in
the
progress
of
this
work
:
 
'
tis
enough
to
say
here
,
as
he
could
not
have
the
honour
of
it
,
in
the
literal
sense
of
the
doctrine
 
<EOS>
he
took
up
with
the
allegory
of
it
;
and
would
often
say
,
especially
when
his
pen
was
a
little
retrograde
,
there
was
as
much
good
meaning
,
truth
,
and
knowledge
,
couched
under
the
veil
of
John
de
la
Casse
's
parabolical
representation
,
  
as
was
to
be
found
in
any
one
poetic
fiction
or
mystic
record
of
antiquity
.
 
<EOS>
Prejudice
of
education
,
he
would
say
,
is
the
devil
,
 
and
the
multitudes
of
them
which
we
suck
in
with
our
mother
's
milk
 
are
the
devil
and
all
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
haunted
with
them
,
brother
Toby
,
in
all
our
lucubrations
and
researches
;
and
was
a
man
fool
enough
to
submit
tamely
to
what
they
obtruded
upon
him
,
 
what
would
his
book
be
?
 
<EOS>
Nothing
,
 
he
would
add
,
throwing
his
pen
away
with
a
vengeance
,
 
nothing
but
a
farrago
of
the
clack
of
nurses
,
and
of
the
nonsense
of
the
old
women
(
of
both
sexes
)
throughout
the
kingdom
.
  
<EOS>
This
is
the
best
account
I
am
determined
to
give
of
the
slow
progress
my
father
made
in
his
Tristra
-
paedia
;
at
which
(
as
I
said
)
<EOS>
he
was
three
years
,
and
something
more
,
indefatigably
at
work
,
and
,
at
last
,
had
scarce
completed
,
by
this
own
reckoning
,
one
half
of
his
undertaking
:
 
<EOS>
the
misfortune
was
,
that
I
was
all
that
time
totally
neglected
and
abandoned
to
my
mother
;
and
what
was
almost
as
bad
,
by
the
very
delay
,
the
first
part
of
the
work
,
upon
which
my
father
had
spent
the
most
of
his
pains
,
was
rendered
entirely
useless
,
 
every
day
a
page
or
two
became
of
no
consequence
.
      
<EOS>
Certainly
it
was
ordained
as
a
scourge
upon
the
pride
of
human
wisdom
,
That
the
wisest
of
us
all
should
thus
outwit
ourselves
,
and
eternally
forego
our
purposes
in
the
intemperate
act
of
pursuing
them
.
  
<EOS>
In
short
my
father
was
so
long
in
all
his
acts
of
resistance
,
 
or
in
other
words
,
 
he
advanced
so
very
slow
with
his
work
,
and
I
began
to
live
and
get
forwards
at
such
a
rate
,
that
if
an
event
had
not
happened
,
 
which
,
when
we
get
to
it
,
if
it
can
be
told
with
decency
,
shall
not
be
concealed
a
moment
from
the
reader
 
<EOS>
I
verily
believe
,
I
had
put
by
my
father
,
and
left
him
drawing
a
sundial
,
for
no
better
purpose
than
to
be
buried
under
ground
.
      
<EOS>
'
Twas
nothing
,
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
lose
two
drops
of
blood
by
it
 
'
twas
not
worth
calling
in
a
surgeon
,
had
he
lived
next
door
to
us
 
thousands
suffer
by
choice
,
<EOS>
what
I
did
by
accident
.
 
<EOS>
Doctor
Slop
made
ten
times
more
of
it
,
than
there
was
occasion
:
 
some
men
rise
,
by
the
art
of
hanging
great
weights
upon
small
wires
,
 
and
I
am
this
day
(
August
<EOS>
the
10th
,
1761
)
paying
part
of
the
price
of
this
man
's
reputation
.
 
<EOS>
O
"
twould
provoke
a
stone
,
to
see
how
things
are
carried
on
in
this
world
!
 
<EOS>
The
chamber
-
maid
had
left
no
.......
...
<EOS>
under
the
bed
:
 
Can
not
you
contrive
,
master
,
quoth
Susannah
,
lifting
up
the
sash
with
one
hand
,
as
she
spoke
,
and
helping
me
up
into
the
window
-
seat
with
the
other
,
 
can
not
you
manage
,
my
dear
,
for
a
single
time
,
to
....
...
..
...
<EOS>
......
?
  
<EOS>
I
was
five
years
old
.
 
<EOS>
Susannah
did
not
consider
that
nothing
was
well
hung
in
our
family
,
 
<EOS>
so
slap
came
the
sash
down
like
lightning
upon
us
;
 
Nothing
is
left
,
 
cried
Susannah
,
 
nothing
is
left
 
for
me
,
but
to
run
my
country
.
    
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
's
house
was
a
much
kinder
sanctuary
;
and
so
Susannah
fled
to
it
.
    
<EOS>
When
Susannah
told
the
corporal
the
misadventure
of
the
sash
,
with
all
the
circumstances
which
attended
the
murder
of
me
,
 
(
as
she
called
it
,
)
 
the
blood
forsook
his
cheeks
,
 
all
accessaries
in
murder
being
principals
,
  
Trim
's
conscience
told
him
he
was
as
much
to
blame
as
Susannah
,
 
<EOS>
and
if
the
doctrine
had
been
true
,
my
uncle
Toby
had
as
much
of
the
bloodshed
to
answer
for
to
heaven
,
as
either
of
'em
;
 
so
that
neither
reason
or
instinct
,
separate
or
together
,
could
possibly
have
guided
Susannah
's
steps
to
so
proper
an
asylum
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
in
vain
to
leave
this
to
the
Reader
's
imagination
:
 
to
form
any
kind
of
hypothesis
that
will
render
these
propositions
feasible
,
he
must
cudgel
his
brains
sore
,
 
and
to
do
it
without
,
 
he
must
have
such
brains
as
no
reader
ever
had
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
Why
should
I
put
them
either
to
trial
or
to
torture
?
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
my
own
affair
:
 
<EOS>
I
'll
explain
it
myself
.
    
<EOS>
@@@Tis
<EOS>
a
pity
,
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
resting
with
his
hand
upon
the
corporal
's
shoulder
,
as
they
both
stood
surveying
their
works
,
 
that
we
have
not
a
couple
of
field
-
pieces
to
mount
in
the
gorge
of
that
new
redoubt
;
 
'
twould
secure
the
lines
all
along
there
,
and
make
the
attack
on
that
side
quite
complete
:
 
get
me
a
couple
cast
,
Trim
.
  
<EOS>
Your
honour
shall
have
them
,
replied
Trim
,
before
tomorrow
morning
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
joy
of
Trim
's
heart
,
nor
was
his
fertile
head
ever
at
a
loss
for
expedients
in
doing
it
,
to
supply
my
uncle
Toby
in
his
campaigns
,
with
whatever
his
fancy
called
for
;
had
it
been
his
last
crown
,
he
would
have
sate
down
and
hammered
it
into
a
paderero
,
to
have
prevented
a
single
wish
in
his
master
.
 
<EOS>
The
corporal
had
already
,
 
what
with
cutting
off
the
ends
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
spouts
 
hacking
and
chiseling
up
the
sides
of
his
leaden
gutters
,
 
melting
down
his
pewter
shaving
-
bason
,
 
and
going
at
last
,
like
Lewis
the
Fourteenth
,
on
to
the
top
of
the
church
,
for
spare
ends
,
&
c.
 
<EOS>
he
had
that
very
campaign
brought
no
less
than
eight
new
battering
cannons
,
besides
three
demi
-
culverins
,
into
the
field
;
my
uncle
Toby
's
demand
for
two
more
pieces
for
the
redoubt
,
had
set
the
corporal
at
work
again
;
and
no
better
resource
offering
,
he
had
taken
the
two
leaden
weights
from
the
nursery
window
:
 
and
as
the
sash
pullies
,
when
the
lead
was
gone
,
were
of
no
kind
of
use
,
he
had
taken
them
away
also
,
to
make
a
couple
of
wheels
for
one
of
their
carriages
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
dismantled
every
sash
-
window
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
house
long
before
,
in
the
very
same
way
,
 
though
not
always
in
the
same
order
;
for
sometimes
the
pullies
have
been
wanted
,
and
not
the
lead
,
 
so
then
he
began
with
the
pullies
,
 
and
the
pullies
being
picked
out
,
then
the
lead
became
useless
,
  
<EOS>
and
so
the
lead
went
to
pot
too
.
    
<EOS>
A
great
Moral
might
be
picked
handsomely
out
of
this
,
but
I
have
not
time
 
'
tis
enough
to
say
,
wherever
the
demolition
began
,
'
twas
equally
fatal
to
the
sash
window
.
    
<EOS>
The
corporal
had
not
taken
his
measures
so
badly
in
this
stroke
of
artilleryship
,
but
that
he
might
have
kept
the
matter
entirely
to
himself
,
and
left
Susannah
to
have
sustained
the
whole
weight
of
the
attack
,
as
she
could
;
 
true
courage
is
not
content
with
coming
off
so
.
 
<EOS>
The
corporal
,
whether
as
general
or
comptroller
of
the
train
,
 
'
twas
no
matter
,
 
had
done
that
,
without
which
,
as
he
imagined
,
the
misfortune
could
never
have
happened
,
 
at
least
in
Susannah
's
hands
;
 
How
would
your
honours
have
behaved
?
 
<EOS>
He
determined
at
once
,
not
to
take
shelter
behind
Susannah
,
 
but
to
give
it
;
and
with
this
resolution
upon
his
mind
,
he
marched
upright
into
the
parlour
,
to
lay
the
whole
manoeuvre
before
my
uncle
Toby
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
had
just
then
been
giving
Yorick
an
account
of
the
Battle
of
Steenkirk
,
and
of
the
strange
conduct
of
count
Solmes
in
ordering
the
foot
to
halt
,
and
the
horse
to
march
where
it
could
not
act
;
which
was
directly
contrary
to
the
king
's
commands
,
and
proved
the
loss
of
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
There
are
incidents
in
some
families
so
pat
to
the
purpose
of
what
is
going
to
follow
,
 
they
are
scarce
exceeded
by
the
invention
of
a
dramatic
writer
;
 
I
mean
of
ancient
days
.
    
<EOS>
Trim
,
by
the
help
of
his
fore
-
finger
,
laid
flat
upon
the
table
,
and
the
edge
of
his
hand
striking
across
it
at
right
angles
,
made
a
shift
to
tell
his
story
so
,
that
priests
and
virgins
might
have
listened
to
it
;
 
and
the
story
being
told
,
 
the
dialogue
went
on
as
follows
.
      
<EOS>
I
would
be
picquetted
to
death
,
cried
the
corporal
,
as
he
concluded
Susannah
's
story
,
before
I
would
suffer
the
woman
to
come
to
any
harm
,
  
'
<EOS>

my
fault

<EOS>
Corporal
Trim
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
,
putting
on
his
hat
which
lay
upon
the
table
,
 
if
any
thing
can
be
said
to
be
a
fault
,
when
the
service
absolutely
requires
it
should
be
done
,
 
'

<EOS>
I
certainly
who
deserve
the
blame
,
 
you
obeyed
your
orders
.
  
<EOS>
Had
count
Solmes
,
Trim
,
done
the
same
at
the
battle
of
Steenkirk
,
said
Yorick
,
drolling
a
little
upon
the
corporal
,
who
had
been
run
over
by
a
dragoon
in
the
retreat
,
 
he
had
saved
thee
;
 
Saved
!
<EOS>
cried
Trim
,
interrupting
Yorick
,
and
finishing
the
sentence
for
him
after
his
own
fashion
,
 
<EOS>
he
had
saved
five
battalions
,
an
'
please
your
reverence
,
every
soul
of
them
:
 
there
was
Cutt

,
 
<EOS>
continued
the
corporal
,
clapping
the
forefinger
of
his
right
hand
upon
the
thumb
of
his
left
,
and
counting
round
his
hand
<EOS>
,
 
there
was
Cutt
's
,
 
Mackay
's
,
 
Angus
's
,
 
Graham
's
,
 
and
Leven
's
,
all
cut
to
pieces

and
so
had
the
English

Trim

said
my

Toby
,
nodding
to
Yorick
,
 
<EOS>
he
's
perfectly
right
.
 
<EOS>
What
signified
his
marching
the
horse
,
continued
the
corporal
,
where
the
ground
was
so
strait
,
that
the
French
had
such
a
nation
of
hedges
,
and
copses
,
and
ditches
,
and
fell'd
trees
laid
this

that
to
cover
them

as
they
always
have

Count
Solmes
should
have
sent
us

we
would
have
fired
muzzle

muzzle
with
them
for
their
lives

<EOS>
There
was
nothing
to
be
done
for
the
horse
:
 
<EOS>
he
had
his
foot
shot
off
however
for
his
pains
,
continued
the
corporal
,
the
very
next
campaign
at
Landen
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Trim

his

<EOS>
my

Possibly
not

Trim

said
my

Toby
;
 
though
if
they
have
the
advantage
of
a
wood

you
give
them
a
moment

intrench
themselves
,
they
are
a
nation
which

pop
and
pop
for

<EOS>
There
is
no
way

to
march
coolly
up

<EOS>
Blood
an

,
shouted
the
corporal
;
 
the
battle
raged
,
 
Yorick
drew
his
chair
a
little
to
one
side
for
safety
,
and
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
my
uncle
Toby
sinking
his
voice
a
note
,
 
resumed
the
discourse
as
follows
.
    
<EOS>
King
William
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
addressing
himself
to
Yorick
,
was
so
terribly
provoked
at
count
Solmes
for
disobeying
his
orders
,
that
he
would
not
suffer
him
to
come
into
his
presence
for
many
months
after
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
,
answered
Yorick
,
the
squire
will
be
as
much
provoked
at
the
corporal
,
as
the
King
at
the
count
.
 
<EOS>
But
"
twould
be
singularly
hard
in
this
case
,
continued
be
,
<EOS>
if
corporal
Trim
,
who
has
behaved
so
diametrically
opposite
to
count
Solmes
,
should
have
the
fate
to
be
rewarded
with
the
same
disgrace
:
 
too
oft
in
this
world
,
do
things
take
that
train
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
spring
a
mine
,
cried
my
uncle
Toby
,
rising
up
,
 
and
blow
up
my
fortifications
,
and
my
house
with
them
,
and
we
would
perish
under
their
ruins
,
ere
I
would
stand
by
and
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
Trim
directed
a
slight
,
 
but
a
grateful
bow
towards
his
master
,
 
<EOS>
and
so
the
chapter
ends
.
      
<EOS>
Then
,
Yorick
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
,
you
and
I
will
lead
the
way
abreast
,
 
and
do
you
,
corporal
,
follow
a
few
paces
behind
us
.
 
<EOS>
And
Susannah
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
said
Trim
,
shall
be
put
in
the
rear
.
  
<EOS>
'
Twas
an
excellent
disposition
,
 
and
in
this
order
,
without
either
drums
beating
,
or
colours
flying
,
they
marched
slowly
from
my
uncle
Toby
's
house
to
Shandy
-
hall
.
    
<EOS>
I
wish
,
said
Trim
,
as
they
entered
the
door
,
 
instead
of
the
sash
weights
,
I
had
cut
off
the
church
spout
,
as
I
once
thought
to
have
done
.
  
<EOS>
You
have
cut
off
spouts
enow
,
replied
Yorick
.
    
<EOS>
As
many
pictures
as
have
been
given
of
my
father
,
how
like
him
soever
in
different
airs
and
attitudes
,
 
not
one
,
or
all
of
them
<EOS>
,
can
ever
help
the
reader
to
any
kind
of
preconception
of
how
my
father
would
think
,
speak
,
or
act
,
upon
any
untried
occasion
or
occurrence
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
that
infinitude
of
oddities
in
him
,
and
of
chances
along
with
it
,
by
which
handle
he
would
take
a
thing
,
 
it
baffled
,
Sir
,
all
calculations
.
 
<EOS>
The
truth
was
,
his
road
lay
so
very
far
on
one
side
,
from
that
wherein
most
men
travelled
,
 
that
every
object
before
him
presented
a
face
and
section
of
itself
to
his
eye
,
altogether
different
from
the
plan
and
elevation
of
it
seen
by
the
rest
of
mankind
.
 
<EOS>
In
other
words
,
'
twas
a
different
object
,
and
in
course
was
differently
considered
:
  
<EOS>
This
is
the
true
reason
,
that
my
dear
Jenny
and
I
,
as
well
as
all
the
world
besides
us
,
have
such
eternal
squabbles
about
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
She
looks
at
her
outside
,
 
<EOS>
I
,
at
her
in
.
.
..
 
<EOS>
How
is
it
possible
we
should
agree
about
her
value
?
    
<EOS>
@@@Tis
a
point
settled
,
 
and
I
mention
it
for
the
comfort
of
Confucius
,
<EOS>
(
Mr
Shandy
is
supposed
to
mean
.
.
.
<EOS>
,
Esq
;
member
for

.
.
<EOS>
,
 
<EOS>
and
not
the
Chinese
Legislator
.
)
<EOS>
who
is
apt
to
get
entangled
in
telling
a
plain
story
 
that
provided
he
keeps
along
the
line
of
his
story
,
 
he
may
go
backwards
and
forwards
as
he
will
,
 
'
tis
still
held
to
be
no
digression
.
  
<EOS>
This
being
premised
,
I
take
the
benefit
of
the
act
of
going
backwards
myself
.
    
<EOS>
Fifty
thousand
pannier
loads
of
devils
 
(
not
of
the
Archbishop
of
Benevento
's
 
<EOS>
I
mean
of
Rabelais
's
devils
)
,
<EOS>
with
their
tails
chopped
off
by
their
rumps
,
could
not
have
made
so
diabolical
a
scream
of
it
,
as
I
did
  
when
the
accident
befel
me
:
 
<EOS>
it
summoned
up
my
mother
instantly
into
the
nursery
,
 
so
that
Susannah
had
but
just
time
to
make
her
escape
down
the
back
stairs
,
as
my
mother
came
up
the
fore
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
though
I
was
old
enough
to
have
told
the
story
myself
,
 
and
young
enough
,
I
hope
,
to
have
done
it
without
malignity
;
yet
Susannah
,
in
passing
by
the
kitchen
,
for
fear
of
accidents
,
had
left
it
in
short
-
hand
with
the
cook
 
the
cook
had
told
it
with
a
commentary
to
Jonathan
,
and
Jonathan
to
Obadiah
;
so
that
by
the
time
my
father
had
rung
the
bell
half
a
dozen
times
,
to
know
what
was
the
matter
above
,
 
<EOS>
was
Obadiah
enabled
to
give
him
a
particular
account
of
it
,
just
as
it
had
happened
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
as
much
,
said
my
father
,
tucking
up
his
night
-
gown
;
 
and
so
walked
up
stairs
.
  
<EOS>
One
would
imagine
from
this
 
(
though
for
my
own
part
I
somewhat
question
it
)
 
that
my
father
,
before
that
time
,
had
actually
wrote
that
remarkable
character
in
the
Tristra
-
paedia
,
which
to
me
is
the
most
original
and
entertaining
one
in
the
whole
book
;
 
and
that
is
the
chapter
upon
sash-
windows
,
with
a
bitter
Philippick
at
the
end
of
it
,
upon
the
forgetfulness
of
chamber
-
maids
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
<EOS>
but
two
reasons
for
thinking
otherwise
.
  
<EOS>
First
,
Had
the
matter
been
taken
into
consideration
,
before
the
event
happened
,
my
father
certainly
would
have
nailed
up
the
sash
window
for
good
an
'
all
;
 
which
,
considering
with
what
difficulty
he
composed
books
,
 
he
might
have
done
with
ten
times
less
trouble
,
than
he
could
have
wrote
the
chapter
:
 
<EOS>
this
argument
I
foresee
holds
good
against
his
writing
a
chapter
,
even
after
the
event
;
but
'
tis
obviated
under
the
second
reason
,
which
I
have
the
honour
to
offer
to
the
world
in
support
of
my
opinion
,
that
my
father
did
not
write
the
chapter
upon
sash
-
windows
and
chamber
-
pots
,
at
the
time
supposed
,
 
and
it
is
this
.
    
<EOS>
That
,
in
order
to
render
the
Tristra
-
paedia
complete
,
 
I
wrote
the
chapter
myself
.
    
<EOS>
My
father
put
on
his
spectacles
 
<EOS>
looked
,
 
took
them
off
,
 
put
them
into
the
case
 
all
in
less
than
a
statutable
minute
;
and
without
opening
his
lips
,
turned
about
and
walked
precipitately
down
stairs
:
 
<EOS>
my
mother
imagined
he
had
stepped
down
for
lint
and
basilicon
;
but
seeing
him
return
with
a
couple
of
folios
under
his
arm
,
and
Obadiah
following
him
with
a
large
reading
-
desk
,
she
took
it
for
granted
'
twas
an
herbal
,
and
so
drew
him
a
chair
to
the
bedside
,
that
he
might
consult
upon
the
case
at
his
ease
.
    
<EOS>
If
it
be
but
right
done
,
 
said
my
father
,
turning
to
the
Section
 
de
sede
vel
subjecto
circumcisionis
,
 
for
he
had
brought
up
Spenser
de
Legibus
Hebraeorum
<EOS>
Ritualibus
 
and
Maimonides
,
in
order
to
confront
and
examine
us
altogether
.
      
<EOS>
If
it
be
but
right
done
,
quoth
<EOS>
he
:
 
<EOS>
only
tell
us
,
cried
my
mother
,
interrupting
him
,
what
herbs
?
 
<EOS>
For
that
,
replied
my
father
,
you
must
send
for
Dr.
Slop
.
  
<EOS>
My
mother
went
down
,
and
my
father
went
on
,
reading
the
section
as
follows
,
  
.
.
.
 
<EOS>
Very
well
,
 
said
my
father
,
.
.
.
 
<EOS>
nay
,
if
it
has
that
convenience
  
and
so
without
stopping
a
moment
to
settle
it
first
in
his
mind
,
whether
the
Jews
had
it
from
the
Egyptians
,
or
the
Egyptians
from
the
Jews
,
 
he
rose
up
,
and
rubbing
his
forehead
two
or
three
times
across
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
,
in
the
manner
we
rub
out
the
footsteps
of
care
,
when
evil
has
trod
lighter
upon
us
than
we
foreboded
<EOS>
,
 
he
shut
the
book
,
and
walked
down
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
said
he
,
mentioning
the
name
of
a
different
great
nation
upon
every
step
as
he
set
his
foot
upon
it
 
if
the
Egyptians
,
 
the
Syrians
,
 
the
Phoenicians
,
 
the
Arabians
,
 
the
Cappadocians
,
 
if
the
Colchi
,
and
Troglodytes
did
it
 
if
Solon
and
Pythagoras
submitted
<EOS>
,
 
what
is
Tristram
?
  
<EOS>
Who
am
I
,
that
I
should
fret
or
fume
one
moment
about
the
matter
?
    
<EOS>
Dear
Yorick
,
said
my
father
smiling
(
for
Yorick
had
broke
his
rank
with
my
uncle
Toby
in
coming
through
the
narrow
entry
,
and
so
had
stept
first
into
the
parlour
)
 
<EOS>
this
Tristram
of
ours
,
I
find
,
comes
very
hardly
by
all
his
religious
rites
.
 
<EOS>
Never
was
the
son
of
Jew
,
Christian
,
Turk
,
or
Infidel
initiated
into
them
in
so
oblique
and
slovenly
a
manner
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
is
no
worse
<EOS>
,
I
trust
,
said
Yorick
.
 
<EOS>
There
has
been
certainly
,
continued
my
father
,
the
deuce
and
all
to
do
in
some
part
or
other
of
the
ecliptic
,
when
this
offspring
of
mine
was
formed
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
you
are
a
better
judge
of
than
I
,
replied
Yorick
.
 
<EOS>
Astrologers
,
quoth
my
father
,
know
better
than
us
both
:
  
the
trine
and
sextil
aspects
have
jumped
awry
,
 
or
the
opposite
of
their
ascendents
have
not
hit
it
,
as
they
should
,
 
or
the
lords
of
the
genitures
(
as
they
call
them
)
<EOS>
have
been
at
bo
-
peep
,
 
or
something
has
been
wrong
above
,
or
below
with
us
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
possible
,
answered
Yorick
.
 
<EOS>
But
is
the
child
,
cried
my
uncle
Toby
,
the
worse
?
 
<EOS>
The
Troglodytes
say
not
,
replied
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
And
your
theologists
,
Yorick
,
tell
us
 
Theologically
?
<EOS>
said
Yorick
,
 
or
speaking
after
the
manner
of
apothecaries
?
<EOS>
(

or

<EOS>
(

)
    
<EOS>
I
'm
not
sure
,
replied
my
father
,
 
<EOS>
but
they
tell
us
,
<EOS>
brother
Toby
,
he
's
the
better
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
Provided
,
said
Yorick
,
you
travel
him
into
Egypt
.
 
<EOS>
Of
that
,
answered
my
father
,
he
will
have
the
advantage
,
when
he
sees
the
Pyramids
.
    
<EOS>
Now
every
word
of
this
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
is
Arabic
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish

said
Yorick
,
'

<EOS>

Ilus
,
(

Greek
Sanchuniatho

<EOS>
continued
my
father
,
circumcised
his
whole
army
one
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Not
without
a
court
martial
?
<EOS>
cried
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
Though
the
learned
,
continued
he
,
taking
no
notice
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
remark
,
but
turning
to
Yorick
,
 
are
greatly
divided
still
who
Ilus
was
;
 
some
say
Saturn
;
 
<EOS>
some
the
Supreme
Being
;
 
others
,
no
more
than
a
brigadier
general
under
Pharaoh
-
neco
.
 
<EOS>
Let
him
be
who
he
will
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
I
know
not
by
what
article
of
war
he
could
justify
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
controvertists
,
answered
my
father
,
assign
two
-
and
-
twenty
different
reasons
for
it
:
 
others
,
indeed
,
who
have
drawn
their
pens
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
question
,
have
shewn
the
world
the
futility
of
the
greatest
part
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
But
then
again
,
our
best
polemic
divines
 
<EOS>
I
wish
there
was
not
a
polemic
divine
,
said
Yorick
,
in
the
kingdom
;
 
one
ounce
of
practical
divinity
 
is
worth
a
painted
ship
-
load
of
all
their
reverences
have
imported
these
fifty
years
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
Mr.
Yorick
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
 
do
tell
me
what
a
polemic
divine
is
?
 
<EOS>
The
best
description
,
captain
Shandy
<EOS>
,
I
have
ever
read
,
is
of
a
couple
of
'em
,
replied
Yorick
,
<EOS>
in
the
account
of
the
battle
fought
single
hands
<EOS>
betwixt
Gymnast
and
captain
Tripet
;
which
I
have
in
my
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
<EOS>
I
may
hear
it
,
<EOS>
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
earnestly
.
  
<EOS>
You
shall
,
said
Yorick
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
the
corporal
is
waiting
for
me
at
the
door
,
 
and
I
know
the
description
of
a
battle
will
do
the
poor
fellow
more
good
than
his
supper
,
 
<EOS>
I
beg
,
<EOS>
brother
,
you
'll
give
him
leave
to
come
in
.
  
<EOS>
With
all
my
soul
,
said
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
Trim
came
in
,
erect
and
happy
as
an
emperor
;
and
having
shut
the
door
,
Yorick
took
a
book
from
his
right
-
hand
coat
-
pocket
,
and
read
,
or
pretended
to
read
,
as
follows
.
      
<EOS>
"
which
words
being
heard
by
all
the
soldiers
which
were
there
,
divers
of
them
being
inwardly
terrified
,
did
shrink
back
and
make
room
for
the
assailant
:
 
all
this
did
Gymnast
<EOS>
very
well
remark
and
consider
;
and
therefore
,
making
as
if
he
would
have
alighted
from
off
his
horse
,
as
he
was
poising
himself
on
the
mounting
side
<EOS>
,
he
most
nimbly
(
with
his
short
sword
by
this
thigh
)
shifting
his
feet
in
the
stirrup
,
and
performing
the
stirrup
-
leather
feat
,
whereby
,
after
the
inclining
of
his
body
downwards
,
he
forthwith
launched
himself
aloft
into
the
air
,
and
placed
both
his
feet
together
upon
the
saddle
,
standing
upright
,
with
his
back
turned
towards
his
horse
's
head
,
 
Now
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
my
case
goes
forward
.
 
<EOS>
Then
suddenly
in
the
same
posture
wherein
he
was
,
he
fetched
a
gambol
upon
one
foot
,
and
turning
to
the
left
-
hand
,
failed
not
to
carry
his
body
perfectly
round
,
just
into
his
former
position
,
without
missing
one
jot
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
said
Tripet
,
I
will
not
do
that
at
this
time
,
 
and
not
without
cause
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
said
Gymnast
,
I
have
failed
,
 
I
will
undo
this
leap
;
then
with
a
marvellous
strength
and
agility
,
turning
towards
the
right
-
hand
,
he
fetched
another
striking
gambol
as
before
;
which
done
,
he
set
his
right
hand
thumb
upon
the
bow
of
the
saddle
,
raised
himself
up
,
and
sprung
into
the
air
,
poising
and
upholding
his
whole
weight
upon
the
muscle
and
nerve
of
the
said
thumb
,
and
so
turned
and
whirled
himself
about
three
times
:
 
at
the
fourth
,
reversing
his
body
,
and
overturning
it
upside
down
,
and
foreside
back
,
without
touching
any
thing
,
he
brought
himself
betwixt
the
horse
's
two
ears
,
and
then
giving
himself
a
jerking
swing
,
he
seated
himself
upon
the
crupper
 
<EOS>
"
  
(
This
ca
n't
be
fighting
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
The
corporal
shook
his
head
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
Have
patience
,
said
Yorick
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
(
Tripet
)
pass'd
<EOS>
his
right
leg
over
his
saddle
,
and
placed
himself
en
croup
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
said
he
,
'
twere
better
for
me
to
get
into
the
saddle
;
then
putting
the
thumbs
of
both
hands
upon
the
crupper
before
him
,
and
there-
upon
leaning
himself
,
as
upon
the
only
supporters
of
his
body
,
he
incontinently
turned
heels
over
head
in
the
air
,
and
strait
found
himself
betwixt
the
bow
of
the
saddle
in
a
tolerable
seat
;
then
springing
into
the
air
with
a
summerset
,
he
turned
him
about
like
a
wind
-
mill
,
and
made
above
a
hundred
frisks
,
turns
,
and
demi
-
pommadas
.
"
 
<EOS>
Good
God
!
<EOS>
cried
Trim
,
losing
all
patience
,
 
one
home
thrust
of
a
bayonet
is
worth
it
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
so
too
,
replied
Yorick
.
    
<EOS>
I
am
of
a
contrary
opinion
,
quoth
my
father
.
      
<EOS>
No
,
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
advanced
nothing
,
<EOS>
replied
my
father
,
making
answer
to
a
question
which
Yorick
had
taken
the
liberty
to
put
to
him
,
 
I
have
advanced
nothing
in
the
Tristra
-
paedia
,
but
what
is
as
clear
as
any
one
proposition
in
Euclid
.
 
<EOS>
Reach
me
,
Trim
,
that
book
from
off
the
scrutoir
:
  
<EOS>
it
has
oft
-
times
been
in
my
mind
,
continued
my
father
,
to
have
read
it
over
both
to
you
,
Yorick
,
and
to
my
brother
Toby
,
and
I
think
it
a
little
unfriendly
in
myself
,
in
not
having
done
it
long
ago
:
 
shall
we
have
a
short
chapter
or
two
now
,
 
and
a
chapter
or
two
hereafter
,
as
occasions
serve
;
and
so
on
,
till
we
get
through
the
whole
?
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
and
Yorick
made
the
obeisance
which
was
proper
;
and
the
corporal
,
though
he
was
not
included
in
the
compliment
,
laid
his
hand
upon
his
breast
,
and
made
his
bow
at
the
same
time
.
 
<EOS>
The
company
smiled
.
 
<EOS>
Trim
,
quoth
my
father
,
has
paid
the
full
price
for
staying
out
the
entertainment
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
seem
to
relish
the
play
,
replied
Yorick
.
 
<EOS>
'
Twas
a
Tom
-
fool
-
battle
,
an
'
please
your
reverence
,
of
captain
Tripet
's
and
that
other
officer
,
making
so
many
summersets
,
as
they
advanced
;
 
the
French
come
on
capering
now
<EOS>
and
then
in
that
way
,
 
but
not
quite
so
much
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
never
felt
the
consciousness
of
his
existence
with
more
complacency
than
what
the
corporal
's
,
and
his
own
reflections
,
made
him
do
at
that
moment
;
 
he
lighted
his
pipe
,
 
Yorick
drew
his
chair
closer
to
the
table
,
 
Trim
snuff'd
<EOS>
the
candle
,
 
my
father
stirr'd
up
the
fire
,
 
took
up
the
book
,
 
cough'd
twice
,
and
begun
.
    
<EOS>
The
first
thirty
pages
,
said
my
father
,
turning
over
the
leaves
,
 
are
a
little
dry
;
and
as
they
are
not
closely
connected
with
the
subject
,
 
for
the
present
we
'll
pass
them
by
:
 
'
tis
a
prefatory
introduction
,
continued
my
father
,
or
an
introductory
preface
<EOS>
(
for
I
am
not
determined
which
name
to
give
it
)
upon
political
or
civil
government
;
the
foundation
of
which
being
laid
in
the
first
conjunction
betwixt
male
and
female
,
for
procreation
of
the
species
 
I
was
insensibly
led
into
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Twas
natural
,
said
Yorick
.
  
<EOS>
The
original
of
society
,
continued
my
father
,
I
'm
satisfied
is
,
what
Politian
tells
us
,
i.
e.
merely
conjugal
;
and
nothing
more
than
the
getting
together
of
one
man
and
one
woman
;
 
to
which
,
(
according
to
Hesiod
)
<EOS>
the
philosopher
adds
a
servant
:
 
but
supposing
in
the
first
beginning
<EOS>
there
were
no
men
servants
born
 
<EOS>
he
lays
the
foundation
of
it
,
in
a
man
,
 
a
woman
 
and
a
bull
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
'
tis
<EOS>
an
ox
,
quoth
Yorick
,
quoting
the
passage
(
Greek
)
 
<EOS>
A
bull
must
have
given
more
trouble
than
his
head
was
worth
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
is
a
better
reason
still
,
said
my
father
(
dipping
his
pen
into
his
ink
)
;
for
the
ox
being
the
most
patient
of
animals
,
and
the
most
useful
withal
in
tilling
the
ground
for
their
nourishment
,
 
was
the
properest
instrument
,
and
emblem
too
,
for
the
new
joined
couple
,
that
the
creation
could
have
associated
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
And
there
is
a
stronger
reason
,
added
my
uncle
Toby
,
than
them
all
for
the
ox
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
had
not
power
to
take
his
pen
out
of
his
ink
-
horn
,
till
he
had
heard
my
uncle
Toby
's
reason
.
 
<EOS>
For
when
the
ground
was
tilled
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
and
made
worth
inclosing
,
then
they
began
to
secure
it
by
walls
and
ditches
,
which
was
the
origin
of
fortification
.
 
<EOS>
True
,
true
,
dear
Toby
,
cried
my
father
,
striking
out
the
bull
,
and
putting
the
ox
in
his
place
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
gave
Trim
a
nod
,
to
snuff
the
candle
,
and
resumed
his
discourse
.
    
<EOS>
I
enter
upon
this
speculation
,
said
my
father
carelessly
,
and
half
shutting
the
book
,
as
he
went
on
,
merely
to
shew
the
foundation
of
the
natural
relation
between
a
father
and
his
child
;
the
right
and
jurisdiction
over
whom
he
acquires
these
several
ways
  
1st
,
by
marriage
.
<EOS>
2d
,
by
adoption
.
<EOS>
3d
,
by
legitimation
.
<EOS>
And
4th
,
by
procreation
;
all
which
I
consider
in
their
order
.
  
<EOS>
I
lay
a
slight
stress
upon
one
of
them
,
replied
Yorick
 
<EOS>
the
act
,
especially
where
it
ends
there
,
in
my
opinion
lays
as
little
obligation
upon
the
child
,
as
it
conveys
power
to
the
father
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
wrong
,
 
said
my
father
argutely
,
and
for
this
plain
reason
.
.
<EOS>
..
 
<EOS>
I
own
,
added
my
father
,
that
the
offspring
,
upon
this
account
,
is
not
so
under
the
power
and
jurisdiction
of
the
mother
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
reason
,
replied
Yorick
,
equally
holds
good
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
is
under
authority
herself
,
said
my
father
:
 
and
besides
,
continued
my
father
,
nodding
his
head
,
and
laying
his
finger
upon
the
side
of
his
nose
,
as
he
assigned
his
reason
,
 
she
is
not
the
principal
agent
,
Yorick
.
 
<EOS>
In
what
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
?
<EOS>
stopping
his
pipe
.
 
<EOS>
Though
by
all
means
,
added
my
father
(
not
attending
to
my
uncle
Toby
)
,
"
The
son
ought
to
pay
her
respect
,
"
as
you
may
read
,
Yorick
,
at
large
in
the
first
book
of
the
Institutes
of
Justinian
,
at
the
eleventh
title
and
the
tenth
section
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
read
it
as
well
,
replied
Yorick
,
in
the
Catechism
.
    
<EOS>
Trim
can
repeat
every
word
of
it
by
heart
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
Pugh
!
<EOS>
said
my
father
,
not
caring
to
be
interrupted
with
Trim
's
saying
his
Catechism
.
 
<EOS>
He
can
,
upon
my
honour
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
Ask
him
,
Mr.
Yorick
,
any
question
you
please
.
      
<EOS>
The
fifth
Commandment
,
Trim
,
 
said
Yorick
,
speaking
mildly
,
and
with
a
gentle
nod
,
as
to
a
modest
Catechumen
.
 
<EOS>
The
corporal
stood
silent
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
ask
him
right
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
raising
his
voice
,
and
giving
it
rapidly
like
the
word
of
command
:
 
<EOS>
The
fifth
 
cried
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
begin
with
the
first
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
said
the
corporal
.
      
<EOS>
Yorick
could
not
forbear
smiling
.
 
<EOS>
Your
reverence
does
not
consider
,
said
the
corporal
,
shouldering
his
stick
like
a
musket
,
and
marching
into
the
middle
of
the
room
,
to
illustrate
his
position
,
 
that
'
tis
exactly
the
same
thing
,
as
doing
one
's
exercise
in
the
field
.
    
<EOS>
"
Join
your
right
-
hand
to
your
firelock
,
"
cried
the
corporal
,
giving
the
word
of
command
,
and
performing
the
motion
.
    
<EOS>
"
Poise
your
firelock
,
"
cried
the
corporal
,
doing
the
duty
still
both
of
adjutant
and
private
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
Rest
your
firelock
;
"
 
one
motion
,
an
'
please
your
reverence
,
you
see
leads
into
another
.
 
<EOS>
If
his
honour
will
begin
but
with
the
first
    
<EOS>
The
First
 
cried
my
uncle
Toby
,
setting
his
hand
upon
his
side
 
.
.
..
  
<EOS>
The
Second
 
cried
my
uncle
Toby
,
waving
his
tobacco
-
pipe
,
as
he
would
have
done
his
sword
at
the
head
of
a
regiment
.
 
<EOS>
The
corporal
went
through
his
manual
with
exactness
;
and
having
honoured
his
father
and
mother
,
made
a
low
bow
,
and
fell
back
to
the
side
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
Every
thing
in
this
world
,
said
my
father
,
is
big
with
jest
,
and
has
wit
in
it
,
and
instruction
too
,
 
if
we
can
but
find
it
out
.
    
<EOS>
Here
is
the
scaffold
work
of
Instruction
,
its
true
point
of
folly
,
without
the
Building
behind
it
.
    
<EOS>
Here
is
the
glass
for
pedagogues
,
preceptors
,
tutors
,
governors
,
gerund-
grinders
,
and
bear
-
leaders
to
view
themselves
in
,
in
their
true
dimensions
.
    
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
there
is
a
husk
and
shell
,
Yorick
,
which
grows
up
with
learning
,
which
their
unskilfulness
knows
not
how
to
fling
away
!
    
<EOS>
Sciences
May
Be
Learned
by
Rote
But
Wisdom
<EOS>
Not
.
  
<EOS>
Yorick
thought
my
father
inspired
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
enter
into
obligations
this
moment
,
said
my
father
,
to
lay
out
all
my
aunt
Dinah
's
legacy
in
charitable
uses
(
of
which
,
by
the
bye
,
my
father
had
no
high
opinion
)
,
if
the
corporal
has
any
one
determinate
idea
annexed
to
any
one
word
he
has
repeated
.
  
<EOS>
Prithee
,
Trim
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
father
,
turning
round
to
him
,
 
<EOS>
What
dost
<EOS>
thou
mean
,
by
"
honouring
thy
father
and
mother
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Allowing
them
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
three
halfpence
a
day
out
of
my
pay
,
when
they
grow
old
.
 
<EOS>
And
didst
thou
do
that
,
Trim
?
said
Yorick
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
indeed
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
Trim
,
said
Yorick
,
springing
out
of
his
chair
,
and
taking
the
corporal
by
the
hand
,
thou
art
the
best
commentator
upon
that
part
of
the
Decalogue
;
and
I
honour
thee
more
for
it
,
corporal
Trim
,
than
if
thou
hadst
had
a
hand
in
the
Talmud
itself
.
    
<EOS>
O
blessed
health
!
<EOS>
cried
my
father
,
making
an
exclamation
,
as
he
turned
over
the
leaves
to
the
next
chapter
,
thou
art
before
all
gold
and
treasure
;
'
tis
thou
who
enlargest
the
soul
,
 
and
openest
all
its
powers
to
receive
instruction
and
to
relish
virtue
.
 
<EOS>
He
that
has
thee
,
has
little
more
to
wish
for
;
 
and
he
that
is
so
wretched
as
to
want
thee
,
 
wants
every
thing
with
thee
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
concentrated
all
that
can
be
said
upon
this
important
head
,
said
my
father
,
into
a
very
little
room
,
therefore
we
'll
read
the
chapter
quite
through
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
read
as
follows
:
  
<EOS>
"
The
whole
secret
of
health
depending
upon
the
due
contention
for
mastery
betwixt
<EOS>
the
radical
heat
and
the
radical
moisture
"
 
<EOS>
You
have
proved
that
matter
of
fact
,
I
suppose
,
above
,
said
Yorick
.
 
<EOS>
Sufficiently
,
replied
my
father
.
  
<EOS>
In
saying
this
,
my
father
shut
the
book
,
 
not
as
if
he
resolved
to
read
no
more
of
it
,
for
he
kept
his
fore
-
finger
in
the
chapter
:
 
nor
pettishly
,
  
<EOS>
for
he
shut
the
book
slowly
;
his
thumb
resting
,
when
he
had
done
it
,
upon
the
upper
-
side
of
the
cover
,
as
his
three
fingers
supported
the
lower
side
of
it
,
without
the
least
compressive
violence
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
demonstrated
the
truth
of
that
point
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
father
,
nodding
to
Yorick
,
most
sufficiently
in
the
preceding
chapter
.
  
<EOS>
Now
could
the
man
in
the
moon
be
told
,
that
a
man
in
the
earth
had
wrote
a
chapter
,
sufficiently
demonstrating
,
That
the
secret
of
all
health
depended
upon
the
due
contention
for
mastery
betwixt
the
radical
heat
and
the
radical
moisture
,
 
and
that
he
had
managed
the
point
so
well
,
that
there
was
not
one
single
word
wet
or
dry
upon
radical
heat
or
radical
moisture
,
throughout
the
whole
chapter
,
 
or
a
single
syllable
in
it
,
pro
or
con
,
directly
or
indirectly
,
upon
the
contention
betwixt
these
two
powers
in
any
part
of
the
animal
oeconomy
    
"
O
thou
eternal
Maker
of
all
beings
!
"
 
<EOS>
he
would
cry
,
striking
his
breast
with
his
right
hand
(
in
case
he
had
one
)
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
whose
power
and
goodness
can
enlarge
the
faculties
of
thy
creatures
to
this
infinite
degree
of
excellence
and
perfection
,
 
<EOS>
What
have
we
Moonites
done
?
"
    
<EOS>
With
two
strokes
,
the
one
at
Hippocrates
,
the
other
at
Lord
Verulam
,
did
my
father
achieve
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
stroke
at
the
prince
of
physicians
,
with
which
he
began
,
was
no
more
than
a
short
insult
upon
his
sorrowful
complaint
of
the
Ars
longa
,
 
and
Vita
brevis
.
 
<EOS>
Life
short
,
cried
my
father
,
 
and
the
art
of
healing
tedious
!
 
<EOS>
And
who
are
we
to
thank
for
both
the
one
and
the
other
,
but
the
ignorance
of
quacks
themselves
,
 
and
the
stage
-
loads
of
chymical
nostrums
,
and
peripatetic
lumber
,
with
which
,
in
all
ages
,
they
have
first
flatter'd
<EOS>
the
world
,
and
at
last
deceived
it
?
    
<EOS>
O
my
lord
Verulam
!
<EOS>
cried
my
father
,
turning
from
Hippocrates
,
and
making
his
second
stroke
at
him
,
as
the
principal
of
nostrum
-
mongers
,
and
the
fittest
to
be
made
an
example
of
to
the
rest
,
 
<EOS>
What
shall
I
say
to
thee
,
my
great
lord
Verulam
?
 
<EOS>
What
shall
I
say
to
thy
internal
spirit
,
 
thy
opium
,
thy
salt
-
petre
,
 
thy
greasy
unctions
,
 
thy
daily
purges
,
 
thy
nightly
clysters
,
and
succedaneums
?
    
<EOS>
My
father
was
never
at
a
loss
what
to
say
to
any
man
,
upon
any
subject
;
and
had
the
least
occasion
for
the
exordium
of
any
man
breathing
:
 
how
he
dealt
with
his
lordship
's
opinion
,
 
you
shall
see
;
 
but
when
 
I
know
not
:
  
we
must
first
see
what
his
lordship
's
opinion
was
.
    
<EOS>
"
The
two
great
causes
,
which
conspire
with
each
other
to
shorten
life
,
says
lord
Verulam
,
are
first
    
<EOS>
"
The
internal
spirit
,
which
like
a
gentle
flame
wastes
the
body
down
to
death
:
 
And
secondly
,
the
external
air
,
that
parches
the
body
up
to
ashes
:
 
which
two
enemies
attacking
us
on
both
sides
of
our
bodies
together
,
at
length
destroy
our
organs
,
and
render
them
unfit
to
carry
on
the
functions
of
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
being
the
state
of
the
case
,
the
road
to
longevity
was
plain
;
nothing
more
being
required
,
says
his
lordship
,
but
to
repair
the
waste
committed
by
the
internal
spirit
,
by
making
the
substance
of
it
more
thick
and
dense
,
by
a
regular
course
of
opiates
on
one
side
,
and
by
refrigerating
the
heat
of
it
on
the
other
,
by
three
grains
and
a
half
of
salt
-
petre
every
morning
before
you
got
up
.
    
<EOS>
Still
this
frame
of
ours
was
left
exposed
to
the
inimical
assaults
of
the
air
without
;
 
but
this
was
fenced
off
again
by
a
course
of
greasy
unctions
,
which
so
fully
saturated
the
pores
of
the
skin
,
that
no
spicula
could
enter
;
 
nor
could
any
one
get
out
.
 
<EOS>
This
put
a
stop
to
all
perspiration
,
sensible
and
insensible
,
<EOS>
which
being
the
cause
of
so
many
scurvy
distempers
 
a
course
of
clysters
was
requisite
to
carry
off
redundant
humours
,
 
and
render
the
system
complete
.
  
<EOS>
What
my
father
had
to
say
to
my
lord
of
Verulam
's
opiates
,
his
salt
-
petre
,
and
greasy
unctions
and
clysters
,
you
shall
read
,
 
but
not
to
-
day
 
or
to-
morrow
:
 
time
presses
upon
me
,
 
my
reader
is
impatient
 
<EOS>
I
must
get
forwards
 
<EOS>
You
shall
read
the
chapter
at
your
leisure
(
if
you
chuse
it
)
,
as
soon
as
ever
the
Tristra
-
paedia
is
published
.
    
<EOS>
Sufficeth
it
<EOS>
,
at
present
to
say
,
my
father
levelled
the
hypothesis
with
the
ground
,
and
in
doing
that
,
the
learned
know
,
he
built
up
and
established
his
own
.
      
<EOS>
The
whole
secret
of
health
,
said
my
father
,
beginning
the
sentence
again
,
depending
evidently
upon
the
due
contention
betwixt
the
radical
heat
and
radical
moisture
within
us
;
 
<EOS>
the
least
imaginable
skill
had
been
sufficient
to
have
maintained
it
,
had
not
the
school
-
men
confounded
the
task
,
merely
(
as
Van
Helmont
,
the
famous
chymist
,
has
proved
)
by
all
along
mistaking
the
radical
moisture
for
the
tallow
and
fat
of
animal
bodies
.
  
<EOS>
Now
the
radical
moisture
is
not
the
tallow
or
fat
of
animals
,
but
an
oily
and
balsamous
substance
;
for
the
fat
and
tallow
,
as
also
the
phlegm
or
watery
parts
,
are
cold
;
whereas
the
oily
and
balsamous
parts
are
of
a
lively
heat
and
spirit
,
which
accounts
for
the
observation
of
Aristotle
,
"
<EOS>
Quod
omne
animal
post
coitum
est
triste
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Now
it
is
certain
,
that
the
radical
heat
lives
in
the
radical
moisture
,
but
whether
vice
versa
,
is
a
doubt
:
 
however
,
when
the
one
decays
,
the
other
decays
also
;
and
then
is
produced
,
either
an
unnatural
heat
,
which
causes
an
unnatural
dryness
 
or
an
unnatural
moisture
,
which
causes
dropsies
.
 
<EOS>
So
that
if
a
child
,
as
he
grows
up
,
can
but
be
taught
to
avoid
running
into
fire
or
water
,
as
either
of
'em
threaten
his
destruction
,
 
'
twill
be
all
that
is
needful
to
be
done
upon
that
head
.
      
<EOS>
The
description
of
the
siege
of
Jericho
itself
,
could
not
have
engaged
the
attention
of
my
uncle
Toby
more
powerfully
than
the
last
chapter
;
 
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
my
father
throughout
it
;
 
he
never
mentioned
radical
heat
and
radical
moisture
,
but
my
uncle
Toby
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
,
and
shook
his
head
;
and
as
soon
as
the
chapter
was
finished
,
he
beckoned
to
the
corporal
to
come
close
to
his
chair
,
to
ask
him
the
following
question
,
  
aside
.
 
<EOS>
.
.
<EOS>
..
 
<EOS>
It
was
at
the
siege
of
Limerick
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
replied
the
corporal
,
making
a
bow
.
  
<EOS>
The
poor
fellow
and
I
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
addressing
himself
to
my
father
,
were
scarce
able
to
crawl
out
of
our
tents
,
at
the
time
the
siege
of
Limerick
was
raised
,
upon
the
very
account
you
mention
.
 
<EOS>
Now
what
can
have
got
into
that
precious
noddle
of
thine
,
my
dear
brother
Toby
?
<EOS>
cried
my
father
,
mentally
.
 
<EOS>
By
Heaven
!
<EOS>
continued
he
,
communing
still
with
himself
,
it
would
puzzle
an
Oedipus
to
bring
it
in
point
.
    
<EOS>
I
believe
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
quoth
<EOS>
the
corporal
,
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
quantity
of
brandy
we
set
fire
to
every
night
,
and
the
claret
and
cinnamon
with
which
I
plyed
your
honour
off
;
 
And
the
geneva
,
Trim
,
added
my
uncle
Toby
,
which
did
us
more
good
than
all
 
<EOS>
I
verily
believe
,
continued
the
corporal
,
we
had
both
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
left
our
lives
in
the
trenches
,
and
been
buried
in
them
too
.
 
<EOS>
The
noblest
grave
,
corporal
!
<EOS>
cried
my
uncle
Toby
,
his
eyes
sparkling
as
he
spoke
,
that
a
soldier
could
wish
to
lie
down
in
.
 
<EOS>
But
a
pitiful
death
for
him
!
<EOS>
an
'
please
your
honour
,
replied
the
corporal
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
was
as
much
Arabick
to
my
father
,
as
the
rites
of
the
Colchi
and
Troglodites
had
been
before
to
my
uncle
Toby
;
my
father
could
not
determine
whether
he
was
to
frown
or
to
smile
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
,
turning
to
Yorick
,
resumed
the
case
at
Limerick
,
more
intelligibly
than
he
had
begun
it
,
 
and
so
settled
the
point
for
my
father
at
once
.
    
<EOS>
It
was
undoubtedly
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
a
great
happiness
for
myself
and
the
corporal
,
that
we
had
all
along
a
burning
fever
,
attended
with
a
most
raging
thirst
,
during
the
whole
five
-
and
-
twenty
days
the
flux
was
upon
us
in
the
camp
;
otherwise
what
my
brother
calls
the
radical
moisture
,
must
,
as
I
conceive
it
,
inevitably
have
got
the
better
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
drew
in
his
lungs
top
-
full
of
air
,
and
looking
up
,
blew
it
forth
again
,
as
slowly
as
he
possibly
could
.
      
<EOS>
It
was
Heaven
's
mercy
to
us
,
continued
my
uncle
Toby
,
which
put
it
into
the
corporal
's
head
to
maintain
that
due
contention
betwixt
the
radical
heat
and
the
radical
moisture
,
by
reinforceing
the
fever
,
as
he
did
all
along
,
with
hot
wine
and
spices
;
whereby
the
corporal
kept
up
(
as
it
were
)
a
continual
firing
,
so
that
the
radical
heat
stood
its
ground
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
,
and
was
a
fair
match
for
the
moisture
,
terrible
as
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
my
honour
,
added
my
uncle
Toby
,
you
might
have
heard
the
contention
within
our
bodies
,
brother
Shandy
,
twenty
toises
.
 
<EOS>
If
there
was
no
firing
,
said
Yorick
.
  
<EOS>
Well
 
said
my
father
,
with
a
full
aspiration
,
and
pausing
a
while
after
the
word
 
Was
I
a
judge
,
and
the
laws
of
the
country
which
made
me
one
permitted
it
,
I
would
condemn
some
of
the
worst
malefactors
,
<EOS>
provided
they
had
had
their
clergy
.
.
.
 
<EOS>
Yorick
,
foreseeing
the
sentence
was
likely
to
end
with
no
sort
of
mercy
,
laid
his
hand
upon
my
father
's
breast
,
and
begged
he
would
respite
it
for
a
few
minutes
,
till
he
asked
the
corporal
a
question
.
 
<EOS>
Prithee
,
Trim
,
said
Yorick
,
without
staying
for
my
father
's
leave
,
 
tell
us
honestly
 
what
is
thy
opinion
concerning
this
self
-
same
radical
heat
and
radical
moisture
?
  
<EOS>
With
humble
submission
to
his
honour
's
better
judgment
,
quoth
the
corporal
,
making
a
bow
to
my
uncle
Toby
 
Speak
thy
opinion
freely
,
corporal

said
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
The
poor
fellow
is
my
servant
,
 
not
my
slave
,
 
added
my
uncle
Toby
,
turning
to
my
father
.
    
<EOS>
The
corporal
put
his
hat
under
his
left
arm
,
and
with
his
stick
hanging
upon
the
wrist
of
it
,
by
a
black
thong
split
into
a
tassel
about
the
knot
,
he
marched
up
to
the
ground
where
he
had
performed
his
catechism
;
then
touching
his
under
-
jaw
with
the
thumb
and
fingers
of
his
right
hand
before
he
opened
his
mouth
,
 
he
delivered
his
notion
thus
.

Just
as
the
corporal
was
humming

to

in

Dr.
Slop

Well

my
good
doctor

cried
my
father
sportively
,
for
the
transitions
of
his
passions
were
unaccountably
sudden
,
 
and
what
has
this
whelp
of
mine
to
say
to
the
matter
?
  
<EOS>
Had
my
father
been
asking
after
the
amputation
of
the
tail
of
a
puppy
-
dog
  
<EOS>
he
could
not
have
done
it
in
a
more
careless
air
:
 
<EOS>
the
system
which
Dr.
Slop
had
laid
down
,
to
treat
the
accident
by

no
way
allowed

such
a
mode
of
enquiry

He
sat
down

<EOS>
Pray

quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby

in
a
manner
which
could
not
go
unanswered

in
what
condition
is
the
boy

replied
Dr.
Slop
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
no
wiser
than
I
was
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
 
returning
his
pipe
into
his
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
Then
let
the
corporal
go
on
,
said
my
father
,
with
his
medical
lecture
.
 
<EOS>
The
corporal
made
a
bow
to
his
old
friend
,
Dr.
Slop
,
and
then
delivered
his
opinion
concerning
radical
heat
and
radical
moisture
,
in
the
following
words
.
    
<EOS>
The
city
of
Limerick
<EOS>
,
the
siege
of
which
was
begun
under
his
majesty
king
William
himself
,
the
year
after
I
went
into
the
army
 
<EOS>
lies
,
an
'
please
your
honours
,
in
the
middle
of
a
devilish
wet
,
swampy
country
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
quite
surrounded
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
with
the
Shannon
,
and
is
,
by
its
situation
,
one
of
the
strongest
fortified
places
in
Ireland
.
    
<EOS>
I
think
this
is
a
new
fashion
,
quoth
Dr.
Slop
,
of
beginning
a
medical
lecture
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
all
true
,
answered
Trim
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
wish
the
faculty
would
follow
the
cut
of
it
,
said
Yorick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tis
all
cut
through
,
an
'
please
your
reverence
,
said
the
corporal
,
with
drains
and
bogs
;
and
besides
,
there
was
such
a
quantity
of
rain
fell
during
the
siege
,
the
whole
country
was
like
a
puddle
,
 
'
twas
that
,
and
nothing
else
,
which
brought
on
the
flux
,
and
which
had
like
to
have
killed
both
his
honour
and
myself
;
now
there
was
no
such
thing
,
after
the
first
ten
days
,
continued
the
corporal
,
for
a
soldier
to
lie
dry
in
his
tent
,
without
cutting
a
ditch
<EOS>
round
it
,
to
draw
off
the
water
;
 
nor
was
that
enough
,
for
those
who
could
afford
it
,
as
his
honour
could
,
without
setting
fire
every
night
to
a
pewter
dish
full
of
brandy
,
which
took
off
the
damp
of
the
air
,
and
made
the
inside
of
the
tent
as
warm
as
a
stove
.
    
<EOS>
And
what
conclusion
dost
thou
draw
,
corporal
Trim
,
cried
my
father
,
from
all
these
premises
?
  
<EOS>
I
infer
,
an
'
please
your
worship
,
replied
Trim
,
that
the
radical
moisture
is
nothing
in
the
world
but
<EOS>
ditch
-
water
 
and
that
the
radical
heat
,
of
those
who
can
go
to
the
expence
of
it
,
is
burnt
brandy
,
 
the
radical
heat
and
moisture
of
a
private
man
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
is
nothing
but
ditch
-
water
 
and
a
dram
of
geneva
 
and
give
us
but
enough
of
it
,
with
a
pipe
of
tobacco
,
to
give
us
spirits
,
and
drive
away
the
vapours
 
<EOS>
we
know
not
what
it
is
to
fear
death
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
at
a
loss
,
Captain
Shandy
,
quoth
Doctor
Slop
,
to
determine
in
which
branch
of
learning
your
servant
shines
most
,
whether
in
physiology
or
divinity
.
 
<EOS>
Slop
had
not
forgot
Trim
's
comment
upon
the
sermon
.
    
<EOS>
It
is
but
an
hour
ago
,
replied
Yorick
,
since
the
corporal
was
examined
in
the
latter
,
and
passed
muster
with
great
honour
.
    
<EOS>
The
radical
heat
and
moisture
,
quoth
Doctor
Slop
,
turning
to
my
father
,
you
must
know
,
is
the
basis
and
foundation
of
our
being
 
as
the
root
of
a
tree
is
the
source
and
principle
of
its
vegetation
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
inherent
in
the
seeds
of
all
animals
,
and
may
be
preserved
sundry
ways
,
but
principally
in
my
opinion
by
consubstantials
,
impriments
,
and
occludents
.
 
<EOS>
Now
this
poor
fellow
,
continued
Dr.
Slop
,
pointing
to
the
corporal
,
has
had
the
misfortune
to
have
heard
some
superficial
empiric
discourse
upon
this
nice
point
.
 
<EOS>
That
he
has
,
 
said
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
Very
likely
,
said
my
uncle
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
of
it
 
quoth
<EOS>
Yorick
.
      
<EOS>
Doctor
Slop
being
called
out
to
look
at
a
cataplasm
he
had
ordered
,
it
gave
my
father
an
opportunity
of
going
on
with
another
chapter
in
the
Tristra-
paedia
.
 
<EOS>
Come
!
<EOS>
cheer
up
,
my
lads
;
I
'll
shew
you
land
 
for
<EOS>
when
we
have
tugged
through
that
chapter
,
the
book
shall
not
be
opened
again
this
twelve
-
month
.
 
<EOS>
Huzza
!
        
<EOS>
Five
years
with
a
bib
under
his
chin
<EOS>
;
  
Four
years
in
travelling
from
Christ
-
cross
-
row
to
Malachi
;
  
A
year
and
a
half
in
learning
to
write
his
own
name
;
  
Seven
long
years
and
more
(
Greek)-ing
it
,
at
Greek
and
Latin
;
  
Four
years
at
his
probations
and
his
negations
 
<EOS>
the
fine
statue
still
lying
in
the
middle
of
the
marble
block
,
 
and
nothing
done
,
but
his
tools
sharpened
to
hew
it
out
!
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
a
piteous
delay
!
 
<EOS>
Was
not
the
great
Julius
Scaliger
within
an
ace
of
never
getting
his
tools
sharpened
at
all
?
 
<EOS>
Forty-
four
years
old
was
he
before
he
could
manage
his
Greek
;
 
and
Peter
Damianus
,
lord
bishop
of
Ostia
,
as
all
the
world
knows
,
could
not
so
much
as
read
,
when
he
was
of
man
's
estate
.
 
<EOS>
And
Baldus
himself
,
as
eminent
as
he
turned
out
after
,
entered
upon
the
law
so
late
in
life
,
that
every
body
imagined
he
intended
to
be
an
advocate
in
the
other
world
:
 
<EOS>
no
wonder
,
when
Eudamidas
,
the
son
of
Archidamas
,
heard
Xenocrates
at
seventy
-
five
disputing
about
wisdom
,
that
he
asked
gravely
,
 
If
the
old
man
be
yet
disputing
and
enquiring
concerning
wisdom
,
 
what
time
will
he
have
to
make
use
of
it
?
  
<EOS>
Yorick
listened
to
my
father
with
great
attention
;
there
was
a
seasoning
of
wisdom
unaccountably
mixed
up
with
his
strangest
whims
,
and
he
had
sometimes
such
illuminations
in
the
darkest
of
his
eclipses
,
as
almost
atoned
for
them
:
 
be
wary
,
Sir
,
when
you
imitate
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
convinced
,
Yorick
,
continued
my
father
,
half
reading
and
half
discoursing
,
that
there
is
a
North
-
west
passage
to
the
intellectual
world
;
and
that
the
soul
of
man
has
shorter
ways
of
going
to
work
,
in
furnishing
itself
with
knowledge
and
instruction
,
than
we
generally
take
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
alack
!
<EOS>
all
fields
have
not
a
river
or
a
spring
running
besides
them
;
  
every
child
,
Yorick
,
has
not
a
parent
to
point
it
out
.
    
<EOS>
The
whole
entirely
depends
,
added
my
father
,
in
a
low
voice
,
upon
the
auxiliary
verbs
,
Mr.
Yorick
.
  
<EOS>
Had
Yorick
trod
upon
Virgil
's
snake
,
he
could
not
have
looked
more
surprised
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
surprised
too
,
cried
my
father
,
observing
it
,
 
and
I
reckon
it
as
one
of
the
greatest
calamities
which
ever
befel
the
republic
of
letters
,
<EOS>
That
those
who
have
been
entrusted
with
the
education
of
our
children
,
and
whose
business
it
was
to
open
their
minds
,
and
stock
them
early
with
ideas
,
in
order
to
set
the
imagination
loose
upon
them
,
have
made
so
little
use
of
the
auxiliary
verbs
in
doing
it
,
as
they
have
done
  
<EOS>
So
that
,
except
Raymond
Lullius
,
and
the
elder
Pelegrini
,
the
last
of
which
arrived
to
such
perfection
in
the
use
of
'em
,
with
his
topics
,
that
,
in
a
few
lessons
,
he
could
teach
a
young
gentleman
to
discourse
with
plausibility
upon
any
subject
,
pro
and
con
,
and
to
say
and
write
all
that
could
be
spoken
or
written
concerning
it
,
without
blotting
a
word
,
to
the
admiration
of
all
who
beheld
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
be
glad
,
said
Yorick
,
interrupting
my
father
,
to
be
made
to
comprehend
this
matter
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
,
said
my
father
.
  
<EOS>
The
highest
stretch
of
improvement
a
single
word
is
capable
of
,
is
a
high
metaphor
,
 
for
which
,
in
my
opinion
,
the
idea
is
generally
the
worse
,
and
not
the
better
;
 
but
be
that
as
it
may
,
 
when
the
mind
has
done
that
with
it
 
there
is
an
end
,
 
the
mind
and
the
idea
are
at
rest
,
 
until
a
second
idea
enters
;
 
and
so
on
.
  
<EOS>
Now
the
use
of
the
Auxiliaries
is
,
at
once
to
set
the
soul
a
-
going
by
herself
upon
the
materials
as
they
are
brought
her
;
and
by
the
versability
of
this
great
engine
,
round
which
they
are
twisted
,
to
open
new
tracts
of
enquiry
,
and
make
every
idea
engender
millions
.
  
<EOS>
You
excite
my
curiosity
greatly
,
said
Yorick
.
  
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
I
have
given
it
up
.
 
<EOS>
The
Danes
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
quoth
the
corporal
,
who
were
on
the
left
at
the
siege
of
Limerick
,
were
all
auxiliaries
.
 
<EOS>
And
very
good
ones
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
auxiliaries
,
Trim
,
my
brother
is
talking
about
,
 
<EOS>
I
conceive
to
be
different
things
.
      
<EOS>
You
do
?
<EOS>
said
my
father
,
rising
up
.
    
<EOS>
My
father
took
a
single
turn
across
the
room
,
then
sat
down
,
and
finished
the
chapter
.
  
<EOS>
The
verbs
auxiliary
we
are
concerned
in
here
,
continued
my
father
,
are
,
am
;
was
;
have
;
had
;
do
;
did
;
make
;
made
;
suffer
;
<EOS>
shall
;
should
;
will
;
would
;
can
;
could
;
owe
;
ought
;
used
;
or
is
wo
nt
.
 
<EOS>
And
these
varied
with
tenses
,
present
,
past
,
future
,
and
conjugated
with
the
verb
<EOS>
see
,
 
or
with
these
questions
added
to
them
;
 
<EOS>
Is
it
?
<EOS>
Was
it
?
<EOS>
Will
it
be
?
<EOS>
Would
it
be
?
<EOS>
May
it
be
?
<EOS>
Might
it
be
?
 
<EOS>
And
these
again
put
negatively
,
Is
it
not
?
<EOS>
Was
it
not
?
<EOS>
Ought
it
not
?
 
<EOS>
Or
affirmatively
,
 
It
is
;
<EOS>
It
was
;
It
ought
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
Or
chronologically
,
 
Has
it
been
always
?
<EOS>
Lately
?
<EOS>
How
long
ago
?
 
<EOS>
Or
hypothetically
,
 
If
it
was
?
<EOS>
If
it
was
not
?
 
<EOS>
What
would
follow
?
 
<EOS>
If
the
French
should
beat
the
English
?
 
<EOS>
If
the
Sun
go
out
of
the
Zodiac
?
  
<EOS>
Now
,
by
the
right
use
and
application
of
these
,
continued
my
father
,
in
which
a
child
's
memory
should
be
exercised
,
there
is
no
one
idea
can
enter
his
brain
,
<EOS>
how
barren
soever
,
but
a
magazine
of
conceptions
and
conclusions
may
be
drawn
forth
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
Didst
thou
ever
see
a
white
bear
?
<EOS>
cried
my
father
,
turning
his
head
round
to
Trim
,
who
stood
at
the
back
of
his
chair
:
 
<EOS>
No
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
replied
the
corporal
.
 
<EOS>
But
thou
couldst
discourse
about
one
,
Trim
,
said
my
father
,
in
case
of
need
?
 
<EOS>
How
is
it
possible
,
brother
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
if
the
corporal
never
saw
one
?
  
<EOS>
'
Tis
<EOS>
the
fact
I
want
,
replied
my
father
,
 
and
the
possibility
of
it
is
as
follows
.
  
<EOS>
A
White
Bear
!
 
<EOS>
Very
well
.
 
<EOS>
Have
I
ever
seen
one
?
 
<EOS>
Might
I
ever
have
seen
one
?
 
<EOS>
Am
I
ever
to
see
one
?
 
<EOS>
Ought
I
ever
to
have
seen
one
?
 
<EOS>
Or
can
I
ever
see
one
?
  
<EOS>
Would
I
had
seen
a
white
bear
!
<EOS>
(
for
how
can
I
imagine
it
?
)
  
<EOS>
If
I
should
see
a
white
bear
,
what
should
I
say
?
 
<EOS>
If
I
should
never
see
a
white
bear
,
<EOS>
what
then
?
  
<EOS>
If
I
never
have
,
can
,
must
,
or
shall
see
a
white
bear
alive
;
have
I
ever
seen
the
skin
of
one
?
 
<EOS>
Did
I
ever
see
one
painted
?
 
<EOS>
described
?
 
<EOS>
Have
I
never
dreamed
of
one
?
  
<EOS>
Did
my
father
,
mother
,
uncle
,
aunt
,
brothers
or
sisters
,
ever
see
a
white
bear
?
 
<EOS>
What
would
they
give
?
 
<EOS>
How
would
they
behave
?
 
<EOS>
How
would
the
white
bear
have
behaved
?
 
<EOS>
Is
he
wild
?
 
<EOS>
Tame
?
 
<EOS>
Terrible
?
 
<EOS>
Rough
?
 
<EOS>
Smooth
?
    
<EOS>
Is
the
white
bear
worth
seeing
?
      
<EOS>
Is
there
no
sin
in
it
?
    
<EOS>
Is
it
better
than
a
Black
One
?
      
<EOS>
We
'll
not
stop
two
moments
,
my
dear
Sir
,
 
only
,
as
we
have
got
through
these
five
volumes
(
In
the
first
edition

the
sixth
volume
began
with
this
chapter

)
,
(
do

Sir

sit
down
upon
a
set
 
they
are
better
than
nothing
)
let
us
just
look
back
upon
the
country
we
have
pass'd
through
.
      
<EOS>
What
a
wilderness
has
it
been
!
<EOS>
and
what
a
mercy
that
we
have
not
both
of
us
been
lost
,
or
devoured
by
wild
beasts
in
it
!
  
<EOS>
Did
you
think
the
world
itself
,
Sir
,
had
contained
such
a
number
of
Jack
Asses
?
 
<EOS>
How
they
view'd
<EOS>
and
review'd
us
as
we
passed
over
the
rivulet
at
the
bottom
of
that
little
valley
!
 
<EOS>
and
when
we
climbed
over
that
hill
,
and
were
just
getting
out
of
sight
 
good
God

<EOS>
what
a
braying
did
they
all
set
up
together

all
those
Jack
Asses

When

his

bear
backwards

through
half
a
dozen
pages
,
he
closed
the
book
for
good
an

in
a
kind
of
triumph
redelivered
it
into
Trim

word
,
Yorick
,
by
this
means
,
you
see
,
is
converted
into
a
thesis
or
an
hypothesis
;
 
every
thesis
and
hypothesis
have
an
off

spring
of
propositions
;
 
and
each
proposition
has
its
own
consequences
and
conclusions
;
every
one
of
which
leads
the
mind
on
again
,
into
fresh
tracks
of
enquiries
and
doubtings
.
 
<EOS>
The
force
of
this
engine
,
added
my
father
,
is
incredible
in
opening
a
child
's
head
.

"
Tis

my

to

thousand
splinters

<EOS>
I
presume
,
said
Yorick
,
smiling
,
 
<EOS>
it
must
be
owing
to
this
,
 
(
for
let
logicians
say
what
they

it

not

That
the
famous
Vincent
Quirino
,
amongst
the
many
other
astonishing
feats
of
his
childhood
,
of
which
the
Cardinal
Bembo
has
given
the
world
so
exact
a
story
,
 
should
be
able
to
paste
up
in
the
public
schools
at
Rome
,
so
early
as
in
the
eighth
year
of
his
age
,
no
less
than
four
thousand
five
hundred
and
fifty
different
theses
,
upon
the
most
abstruse
points
of
the
most
abstruse
theology
;
 
and
to
defend
and
maintain
them
in
such
sort
,
as
to
cramp
and
dumbfound
his
opponents
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
that
,
cried
my
father
,
to
what
is
told
us
of
Alphonsus
Tostatus
,
who
,
almost
in
his
nurse
's
arms
,
learned
all
the
sciences
and
liberal
arts
without
being
taught
any
one
of
them
?
 
<EOS>
What
shall
we
say
of
the
great
Piereskius
?
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
very
man
,
cried
my
uncle
Toby
<EOS>
,
I
once
told
you
of
,
brother
Shandy
,
who
walked
a
matter
of
five
hundred
miles
,
reckoning
from
Paris
to
Shevling
,
and
from
Shevling
back
again
,
merely
to
see
Stevinus
's
flying
chariot
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
very
great
man
!
<EOS>
added
my
uncle
Toby
(
meaning
Stevinus
)
 
<EOS>
He
was
so
,
brother
Toby
,
said
my
father
(
meaning
Piereskius
)
 
and
had
multiplied
his
ideas
so
fast
,
and
increased
his
knowledge
to
such
a
prodigious
stock
,
that
,
if
we
may
give
credit
to
an
anecdote
concerning
him
,
which
we
can
not
withhold
here
,
without
shaking
the
authority
of
all
anecdotes
whatever
 
at
seven
years
of
age
,
his
father
committed
entirely
to
his
care
the
education
of
his
younger
brother
,
a
boy
of
five
years
old
,
 
with
the
sole
management
of
all
his
concerns
.
 
<EOS>
Was
the
father
as
wise
as
the
son
?
<EOS>
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
<EOS>
:
 
<EOS>
I
should
think
not
,
said
Yorick
:
 
<EOS>
But
what
are
these
,
continued
my
father
 
(
breaking
out
in
a
kind
of
enthusiasm
)
 
<EOS>
what
are
these
,
to
those
prodigies
of
childhood
in
Grotius
,
Scioppius
,
Heinsius
,
Politian
,
Pascal
,
Joseph
Scaliger
,
Ferdinand
de
Cordoue
,
and
others
 
some
of
which
left
off
their
substantial
forms
at
nine
years
old
,
or
sooner
,
and
went
on
reasoning
without
them
;
 
others
went
through
their
classics
at
seven
;
 
wrote
tragedies
at
eight
;
 
Ferdinand
de
Cordoue
was
so
wise
at
nine
<EOS>
,
 
'
twas
thought
the
Devil
was
in
him
;
 
and
at
Venice
gave
such
proofs
of
his
knowledge
and
goodness
,
that
the
monks
imagined
he
was
Antichrist
,
or
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Others
were
masters
of
fourteen
languages
at
ten
,
 
finished
the
course
of
their
rhetoric
,
poetry
,
logic
,
and
ethics
,
at
eleven
,
 
put
forth
their
commentaries
upon
Servius
and
Martianus
Capella
at
twelve
,
 
and
at
thirteen
received
their
degrees
in
philosophy

:
 
but
you
forget
the
great
Lipsius
,
quoth
Yorick
,
who
composed
a
work

<EOS>
the
day
he
was
born
:
 
They
should
have
wiped
it
up
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
and
said
no
more
about
it
.
    
<EOS>
When
the
cataplasm
was
ready
,
a
scruple
of
decorum
had
unseasonably
rose
up
in
Susannah
's
conscience
,
about
holding
the
candle
,
whilst
Slop
tied
it
on
;
Slop
had
not
treated
Susannah
's
distemper
with
anodynes
,
 
and
so
a
quarrel
had
ensued
betwixt
them
.
    
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
oh
!
 
<EOS>
said
Slop
,
casting
a
glance
of
undue
freedom
in
Susannah
's
face
,
as
she
declined
the
office
;
 
then
,
I
think
I
know
you
,
madam
 
You
know
me
,
Sir
!
<EOS>
cried
Susannah
fastidiously
,
and
with
a
toss
of
her
head
,
levelled
evidently
,
not
at
his
profession
,
but
at
the
doctor
himself
,
 
you
know
me
!
<EOS>
cried
Susannah
again
.
 
<EOS>
Doctor
Slop
clapped
his
finger
and
his
thumb
instantly
upon
his
nostrils
;
 
Susannah
's
spleen
was
ready
to
burst
at
it
;
  
'
Tis
false
,
said
Susannah
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
come
,
Mrs.
Modesty
,
said
Slop
,
not
a
little
elated
with
the
success
of
his
last
thrust
,
 
If
you
wo
n't
hold
the
candle
,
and
look
 
you
may
hold
it
and
shut
your
eyes
:
 
<EOS>
That
's
one
of
your
popish
shifts
,
cried
Susannah
:
 
<EOS>
"
Tis
better
,
said
Slop
,
with
a
nod
,
than
no
shift
at
all
,
young
woman
;
 
I
defy
you
,
Sir
,
cried
Susannah
,
pulling
her
shift
sleeve
below
her
elbow
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
almost
impossible
for
two
persons
to
assist
each
other
in
a
surgical
case
with
a
more
splenetic
cordiality
.
  
<EOS>
Slop
snatched
up
the
cataplasm
 
Susannah
snatched
up
the
candle
;
 
A
little
this
way
,
said
Slop
;
<EOS>
Susannah
looking
one
way
,
and
rowing
another
,
instantly
set
fire
to
Slop
's
wig
,
which
being
somewhat
bushy
and
unctuous
withal
,
was
burnt
out
before
it
was
well
kindled
.
 
<EOS>
You
impudent
whore
!
<EOS>
cried
Slop
,
 
(
for
what
is
passion
,
but
a
wild
beast
?
)
 
<EOS>
you
impudent
whore
,
cried
Slop
,
getting
upright
,
with
the
cataplasm
in
his
hand
;
 
I
never
was
the
destruction
of
any
body
's
nose
,
said
Susannah
,
 
which
is
more
than
you
can
say
:
 
Is
it
?
<EOS>
cried
Slop
,
throwing
the
cataplasm
in
her
face
;
 
Yes
,
it
is
,
cried
Susannah
,
returning
the
compliment
with
what
was
left
in
the
pan
.
    
<EOS>
Doctor
Slop
and
Susannah
filed
cross
-
bills
against
each
other
in
the
parlour
;
which
done
,
as
the
cataplasm
had
failed
,
they
retired
into
the
kitchen
to
prepare
a
fomentation
for
me
;
 
and
whilst
that
was
doing
,
my
father
determined
the
point
as
you
will
read
.
    
<EOS>
You
see
'
tis
high
time
,
said
my
father
,
addressing
himself
equally
to
my
uncle
Toby
and
Yorick
,
to
take
this
young
creature
out
of
these
women
's
hands
,
and
put
him
into
those
of
a
private
governor
.
 
<EOS>
Marcus
Antoninus
provided
fourteen
governors
all
at
once
to
superintend
his
son
Commodus
's
education
,
 
and
in
six
weeks
he
cashiered
five
of
them
;
 
I
know
very
well
,
continued
my
father
,
that
Commodus
's
mother
was
in
love
with
a
gladiator
at
the
time
of
her
conception
,
which
accounts
for
a
great
many
of
Commodus
's
cruelties
when
he
became
emperor
;
 
but
still
I
am
of
opinion
,
that
those
five
whom
Antoninus
dismissed
,
did
Commodus
's
temper
,
in
that
short
time
,
more
hurt
than
the
other
nine
were
able
to
rectify
all
their
lives
long
.
  
<EOS>
Now
as
I
consider
the
person
who
is
to
be
about
my
son
,
as
the
mirror
in
which
he
is
to
view
himself
from
morning
to
night
,
by
which
he
is
to
adjust
his
looks
,
his
carriage
,
and
perhaps
the
inmost
sentiments
of
his
heart
;
 
I
would
have
one
,
Yorick
,
if
possible
,
polished
at
all
points
,
fit
for
my
child
to
look
into
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
very
good
sense
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
to
himself
.
    
<EOS>
There
is
,
continued
my
father
,
a
certain
mien
and
motion
of
the
body
and
all
its
parts
,
both
in
acting
and
speaking
,
which
argues
a
man
well
within
;
and
I
am
not
at
all
surprised
that
Gregory
of
Nazianzum
,
upon
observing
the
hasty
and
untoward
gestures
of
Julian
,
should
foretel
he
would
one
day
become
an
apostate
;
 
or
that
St.
Ambrose
should
turn
his
Amanuensis
out
of
doors
,
because
of
an
indecent
motion
of
his
head
,
which
went
backwards
and
forwards
like
a
flail
;
 
or
that
Democritus
should
conceive
Protagoras
to
be
a
scholar
,
from
seeing
him
bind
up
a
faggot
,
and
thrusting
,
as
he
did
it
,
the
small
twigs
inwards
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
a
thousand
unnoticed
openings
,
continued
my
father
,
which
let
a
penetrating
eye
at
once
into
a
man
's
soul
;
and
I
maintain
it
,
added
he
,
that
a
man
of
sense
does
not
lay
down
his
hat
in
coming
into
a
room
,
 
or
take
it
up
in
going
out
of
it
,
but
something
escapes
,
which
discovers
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
for
these
reasons
,
continued
my
father
,
that
the
governor
I
make
choice
of
shall
neither
(
Vid
.
<EOS>
Pellegrina
.
)
<EOS>
lisp
,
or
squint
,
or
wink
,
or
talk
loud
,
or
look
fierce
,
or
foolish
;
 
or
bite
his
lips
,
or
grind
his
teeth
,
or
speak
through
his
nose
,
or
pick
it
,
or
blow
it
with
his
fingers
.
    
<EOS>
He
shall
neither
walk
fast
,
 
or
slow
,
or
fold
his
arms
,
 
for
that
is
laziness
;
 
or
hang
them
down
,
 
for
that
is
folly
;
or
hide
them
in
his
pocket
,
for
that
is
nonsense
.
    
<EOS>
He
shall
neither
strike
,
or
pinch
,
or
tickle
 
or
bite
,
or
cut
his
nails
,
or
hawk
,
or
spit
,
or
snift
,
or
drum
with
his
feet
or
fingers
in
company
;
 
nor
(
<EOS>
according
to
Erasmus
)
<EOS>
shall
he
speak
to
any
one
in
making
water
,
 
nor
shall
he
point
to
carrion
or
excrement
.
 
<EOS>
Now
this
is
all
nonsense
again
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
to
himself
.
    
<EOS>
I
will
have
him
,
continued
my
father
,
cheerful
,
facete
,
jovial
;
at
the
same
time
,
prudent
,
attentive
to
business
,
vigilant
,
acute
,
argute
,
inventive
,
quick
in
resolving
doubts
and
speculative
questions
;
 
he
shall
be
wise
,
and
judicious
,
and
learned
:
 
<EOS>
And
why
not
humble
,
and
moderate
,
and
gentle-
tempered
,
and
good
?
<EOS>
said
Yorick
:
 
<EOS>
And
why
not
,
cried
my
uncle
Toby
,
free
,
and
generous
,
and
bountiful
,
and
brave
?
 
<EOS>
He
shall
,
my
dear
Toby
,
replied
my
father
,
getting
up
and
shaking
him
by
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
brother
Shandy
,
answered
my
uncle
Toby
,
raising
himself
off
the
chair
,
and
laying
down
his
pipe
to
take
hold
of
my
father
's
other
hand
,
 
<EOS>
I
humbly
beg
I
may
recommend
poor
Le
Fever
's
son
to
you
;
 
<EOS>
a
tear
of
joy
of
the
first
water
sparkled
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
eye
,
and
another
,
the
fellow
to
it
,
in
the
corporal
's
,
as
the
proposition
was
made
;
 
<EOS>
you
will
see
why
when
you
read
Le
Fever
's
story
:
 
fool
that
I
was
!
<EOS>
nor
can
I
recollect
(
nor
perhaps
you
)
without
turning
back
to
the
place
,
what
it
was
that
hindered
me
from
letting
the
corporal
tell
it
in
his
own
words
;
 
but
the
occasion
is
lost
,
 
I
must
tell
it
now
in
my
own
.
    
<EOS>
The
Story
of
Le
Fever
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
some
time
in
the
summer
of
that
year
in
which
Dendermond
was
taken
by
the
allies
,
 
which
was
about
seven
years
before
my
father
came
into
the
country
,
 
and
about
as
many
,
after
the
time
,
that
my
uncle
Toby
and
Trim
had
privately
decamped
from
my
father
's
house
in
town
,
in
order
to
lay
some
of
the
finest
sieges
to
some
of
the
finest
fortified
cities
in
Europe
 
when
my
uncle
Toby
was
one
evening
getting
his
supper
,
with
Trim
sitting
behind
him
at
a
small
sideboard
,
 
I
say
,
sitting
 
for
in
consideration
of
the
corporal
's
lame
knee
(
which
sometimes
gave
him
exquisite
pain
)
 
<EOS>
when
my
uncle
Toby
dined
or
supped
alone
,
he
would
never
suffer
the
corporal
to
stand
;
and
the
poor
fellow
's
veneration
for
his
master
was
such
,
that
,
with
a
proper
artillery
,
my
uncle
Toby
could
have
taken
Dendermond
itself
,
with
less
trouble
than
he
was
able
to
gain
this
point
over
him
;
for
many
a
time
when
my
uncle
Toby
supposed
the
corporal
's
leg
was
at
rest
,
he
would
look
back
,
and
detect
him
standing
behind
him
with
the
most
dutiful
respect
:
 
<EOS>
this
bred
more
little
squabbles
<EOS>
betwixt
them
,
than
all
other
causes
for
five
-
and
-
twenty
years
together
 
<EOS>
But
this
is
neither
here
nor
there
 
<EOS>
why
do
I
mention
it
?
 
<EOS>
Ask
my
pen
,
 
<EOS>
it
governs
me
,
 
<EOS>
I
govern
not
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
one
evening
sitting
thus
at
his
supper
,
when
the
landlord
of
a
little
inn
in
the
village
came
into
the
parlour
,
with
an
empty
phial
in
his
hand
,
to
beg
a
glass
or
two
of
sack
;
'
Tis
for
a
poor
gentleman
,
 
<EOS>
I
think
,
of
the
army
,
said
the
landlord
,
who
has
been
taken
ill
at
my
house
four
days
ago
,
and
has
never
held
up
his
head
since
,
or
had
a
desire
to
taste
any
thing
,
till
just
now
,
that
he
has
a
fancy
for
a
glass
of
sack
and
a
thin
toast
,
 
I
think
,
says
he
,
taking
his
hand
from
his
forehead
,
it
would
comfort
me
.
      
<EOS>
If
I
could
neither
beg
,
borrow
,
or
buy
such
a
thing
 
<EOS>
added
the
landlord
,
 
<EOS>
I
would
almost
steal
it
for
the
poor
gentleman
,
he
is
so
ill
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
in
God
he
will
still
mend
,
<EOS>
continued
he
,
 
we
are
all
of
us
concerned
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
Thou
art
<EOS>
a
good
-
natured
soul
<EOS>
,
I
will
answer
for
thee
,
cried
my
uncle
Toby
;
and
thou
shalt
drink
the
poor
gentleman
's
health
in
a
glass
of
sack
thyself
,
 
and
take
a
couple
of
bottles
with
my
service
,
and
tell
him
he
is
heartily
welcome
to
them
,
and
to
a
dozen
more
if
they
will
do
him
good
.
  
<EOS>
Though
I
am
persuaded
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
as
the
landlord
shut
the
door
,
he
is
a
very
compassionate
fellow
 
Trim
,
 
yet
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
entertaining
a
high
opinion
of
his
guest
too
;
there
must
be
something
more
than
common
in
him
,
that
in
so
short
a
time
should
win
so
much
upon
the
affections
of
his
host
;
 
And
of
his
whole
family
,
added
the
corporal
,
for
they
are
all
concerned
for
him
,
.
 
<EOS>
Step
after
him
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
 
do
Trim
,
 
and
ask
if
he
knows
his
name
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
quite
forgot
it
truly
,
said
the
landlord
,
coming
back
into
the
parlour
with
the
corporal
,
 
<EOS>
but
I
can
ask
his
son
again
:
 
<EOS>
Has
he
a
son
with
him
then
?
<EOS>
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
A
boy
,
replied
the
landlord
,
of
about
eleven
or
twelve
years
of
age
;
 
but
the
poor
creature
has
tasted
almost
as
little
as
his
father
;
he
does
nothing
but
mourn
and
lament
for
him
night
and
day
:
 
<EOS>
He
has
not
stirred
from
the
bed
-
side
these
two
days
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
,
and
thrust
his
plate
from
before
him
,
as
the
landlord
gave
him
the
account
;
and
Trim
,
without
being
ordered
,
took
away
,
without
saying
one
word
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
after
brought
him
his
pipe
and
tobacco
.
    
<EOS>
Stay
in
the
room
a
little
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
  
<EOS>
Trim
!
 
<EOS>
said
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
after
he
lighted
his
pipe
,
and
smoak'd
about
a
dozen
whiffs
.
 
<EOS>
Trim
came
in
front
of
his
master
,
and
made
his
bow
;
 
my
uncle
Toby
smoak'd
on
,
and
said
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
Corporal
!
<EOS>
said
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
the
corporal
made
his
bow
.
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
proceeded
no
farther
,
but
finished
his
pipe
.
  
<EOS>
Trim
!
<EOS>
said
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
I
have
a
project
in
my
head
,
as
it
is
a
bad
night
,
of
wrapping
myself
up
warm
in
my
roquelaure
,
and
paying
a
visit
to
this
poor
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
Your
honour
's
roquelaure
,
replied
the
corporal
,
has
not
once
been
had
on
,
since
the
night
before
your
honour
received
your
wound
,
when
we
mounted
guard
in
the
trenches
before
the
gate
of
St.
Nicholas
;
 
and
besides
,
it
is
so
cold
and
rainy
a
night
,
that
what
with
the
roquelaure
,
and
what
with
the
weather
,
'
twill
be
enough
to
give
your
honour
your
death
,
and
bring
on
your
honour
's
torment
in
your
groin
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
so
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
;
but
I
am
not
at
rest
in
my
mind
,
Trim
,
since
the
account
the
landlord
has
given
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
not
known
so
much
of
this
affair
,
 
<EOS>
added
my
uncle
Toby
,
 
or
that
I
had
known
more
of
it
:
 
<EOS>
How
shall
we
manage
it
?
 
<EOS>
Leave
it
,
<EOS>
an't
please
your
honour
,
to
me
,
quoth
<EOS>
the
corporal
;
 
<EOS>
I
'll
take
my
hat
and
stick
and
go
to
the
house
and
reconnoitre
,
and
act
accordingly
;
and
I
will
bring
your
honour
a
full
account
in
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
shalt
go
,
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
and
here
's
a
shilling
for
thee
to
drink
with
his
servant
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
get
it
all
out
of
him
,
said
the
corporal
,
shutting
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
filled
his
second
pipe
;
and
had
it
not
been
,
that
he
now
and
then
wandered
from
the
point
,
with
considering
whether
it
was
not
full
as
well
to
have
the
curtain
of
the
tennaile
a
straight
line
,
as
a
crooked
one
,
 
he
might
be
said
to
have
thought
of
nothing
else
but
poor
Le
Fever
and
his
boy
the
whole
time
he
smoaked
it
.
    
<EOS>
The
Story
of
Le
Fever
Continued
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
till
my
uncle
Toby
had
knocked
the
ashes
out
of
his
third
pipe
,
that
corporal
Trim
returned
from
the
inn
,
and
gave
him
the
following
account
.
  
<EOS>
I
despaired
,
at
first
,
said
the
corporal
,
of
being
able
to
bring
back
your
honour
any
kind
of
intelligence
concerning
the
poor
sick
lieutenant
 
<EOS>
Is
he
in
the
army
,
then
?
<EOS>
said
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
 
<EOS>
He
is
,
said
the
corporal
 
<EOS>
And
in
what
regiment
?
<EOS>
said
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
your
honour
,
replied
the
corporal
,
<EOS>
every
thing
straight
forwards
,
as
I
learnt
it
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
Trim
,
I
'll
fill
another
pipe
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
and
not
interrupt
thee
till
thou
hast
done
;
so
sit
down
at
thy
ease
,
Trim
,
in
the
window
-
seat
,
and
begin
thy
story
again
.
 
<EOS>
The
corporal
made
his
old
bow
,
which
generally
spoke
as
plain
as
a
bow
could
speak
it
 
<EOS>
Your
honour
is
good
:
 
And
having
done
that
,
he
sat
down
,
as
he
was
ordered
,
 
and
begun
the
story
to
my
uncle
Toby
over
again
in
pretty
near
the
same
words
.
  
<EOS>
I
despaired
at
first
,
said
the
corporal
,
of
being
able
to
bring
back
any
intelligence
to
your
honour
,
about
the
lieutenant
and
his
son
;
for
when
I
asked
where
his
servant
was
,
from
whom
I
made
myself
sure
of
knowing
every
thing
which
was
proper
to
be
asked
,
 
<EOS>
That
's
a
right
distinction
,
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
I
was
answered
,
an
'
please
your
honour
<EOS>
,
that
he
had
no
servant
with
him
;
 
that
he
had
come
to
the
inn
with
hired
horses
,
which
,
upon
finding
himself
unable
to
proceed
(
to
join
,
I
suppose
,
the
regiment
)
,
he
had
dismissed
the
morning
after
he
came
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
get
better
,
my
dear
,
said
he
,
as
he
gave
his
purse
to
his
son
to
pay
the
man
,
 
we
can
hire
horses
from
hence
.
 
<EOS>
But
alas
!
<EOS>
the
poor
gentleman
will
never
get
from
hence
,
said
the
landlady
to
me
,
 
for
I
heard
the
death
-
watch
all
night
long
;
 
and
when
he
dies
,
the
youth
,
his
son
,
will
certainly
die
with
him
;
for
he
is
broken-
hearted
already
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
hearing
this
account
,
continued
the
corporal
,
when
the
youth
came
into
the
kitchen
,
to
order
the
thin
toast
the
landlord
spoke
of
;
 
but
I
will
do
it
for
my
father
myself
,
said
the
youth
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
let
my
save
you
the
trouble
,
young
gentleman
,
said
I
,
taking
up
a
fork
for
the
purpose
,
and
offering
him
my
chair
to
sit
down
upon
by
the
fire
,
whilst
I
did
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
,
Sir
,
said
he
,
very
modestly
,
I
can
please
him
best
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
<EOS>
,
said
I
,
<EOS>
his
honour
will
not
like
the
toast
the
worse
for
being
toasted
by
an
old
soldier
.
 
<EOS>
The
youth
took
hold
of
my
hand
,
and
instantly
burst
into
tears
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
youth
!
<EOS>
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
 
he
has
been
bred
up
from
an
infant
in
the
army
,
and
the
name
of
a
soldier
,
Trim
,
sounded
in
his
ears
like
the
name
of
a
friend
;
 
I
wish
I
had
him
here
.
    
<EOS>
I
never
,
in
the
longest
march
,
said
the
corporal
,
had
so
great
a
mind
to
my
dinner
,
as
I
had
to
cry
with
him
for
company
:
 
<EOS>
What
could
be
the
matter
with
me
,
an
'
please
your
honour
?
 
<EOS>
Nothing
in
the
world
,
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
blowing
his
nose
,
 
but
that
thou
art
a
good
-
natured
fellow
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
gave
him
the
toast
,
continued
the
corporal
,
I
thought
it
was
proper
to
tell
him
I
was
captain
Shandy
's
servant
,
and
that
your
honour
(
though
a
stranger
)
was
extremely
concerned
for
his
father
;
 
and
that
if
there
was
any
thing
in
your
house
or
cellar
 
(
And
thou
might'st
have
added
my
purse
too
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
)
,
 
<EOS>
he
was
heartily
welcome
to
it
:
 
<EOS>
He
made
a
very
low
bow
(
which
was
meant
to
your
honour
)
,
but
no
answer
 
for
his
heart
was
full
 
<EOS>
so
he
went
up
stairs
with
the
toast
;
 
<EOS>
I
warrant
you
,
my
dear
,
said
I
,
as
I
opened
the
kitchen
-
door
,
your
father
will
be
well
again
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Yorick
's
curate
was
smoking
a
pipe
by
the
kitchen
fire
,
 
but
said
not
a
word
good
or
bad
to
comfort
the
youth
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
it
wrong
;
added
the
corporal
 
<EOS>
I
think
so
too
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
lieutenant
had
taken
his
glass
of
sack
and
toast
,
he
felt
himself
a
little
revived
,
and
sent
down
into
the
kitchen
,
to
let
me
know
,
that
in
about
ten
minutes
he
should
be
glad
if
I
would
step
up
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
,
said
the
landlord
,
he
is
going
to
say
his
prayers
,
 
<EOS>
for
there
was
a
book
laid
upon
the
chair
by
his
bed
-
side
,
and
as
I
shut
the
door
,
I
saw
his
son
take
up
a
cushion
.
    
<EOS>
I
thought
,
said
the
curate
,
that
you
gentlemen
of
the
army
,
Mr.
Trim
,
never
said
your
prayers
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
the
poor
gentleman
say
his
prayers
last
night
,
said
the
landlady
,
very
devoutly
,
and
with
my
own
ears
,
or
I
could
not
have
believed
it
.
 
<EOS>
Are
you
sure
of
it
?
<EOS>
replied
the
curate
.
 
<EOS>
A
soldier
,
an
'
please
your
reverence
,
said
I
,
prays
as
often
(
of
his
own
accord
)
as
a
parson
;
 
and
when
he
is
fighting
for
his
king
,
and
for
his
own
life
,
and
for
his
honour
too
,
he
has
the
most
reason
to
pray
to
God
of
any
one
in
the
whole
world
 
<EOS>
'
Twas
well
said
of
thee
,
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
a
soldier
,
said
I
,
an
'
please
your
reverence
,
has
been
standing
for
twelve
hours
together
in
the
trenches
,
up
to
his
knees
in
cold
water
,
 
or
engaged
,
said
I
,
for
months
together
in
long
and
dangerous
marches
;
 
harassed
,
<EOS>
perhaps
,
in
his
rear
to
-
day
;
 
harassing
others
to
-
morrow
;
 
detached
here
;
  
<EOS>
countermanded
there
;
 
resting
this
night
out
upon
his
arms
;
 
beat
up
in
his
shirt
the
next
;
 
benumbed
in
his
joints
;
 
perhaps
without
straw
in
his
tent
to
kneel
on
;
 
must
say
his
prayers
how
and
when
he
can
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
,
said
I
,
 
for
I
was
piqued
,
quoth
<EOS>
the
corporal
,
for
the
reputation
of
the
army
<EOS>
,
  
I
believe
,
an
'
please
your
reverence
,
said
I
,
that
when
a
soldier
gets
time
to
pray
,
 
he
prays
as
heartily
as
a
parson
,
 
though
not
with
all
his
fuss
and
hypocrisy
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
shouldst
not
have
said
that
,
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
 
for
God
only
knows
who
is
a
hypocrite
,
and
who
is
not
:
 
At
the
great
and
general
review
of
us
all
,
corporal
,
at
the
day
of
judgment
(
and
not
till
then
)
 
<EOS>
it
will
be
seen
who
has
done
their
duties
in
this
world
,
 
and
who
has
not
;
and
we
shall
be
advanced
,
Trim
,
accordingly
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
we
shall
,
said
Trim
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
in
the
Scripture
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
;
and
I
will
shew
it
thee
to
-
morrow
:
 
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
we
may
depend
upon
it
,
Trim
,
for
our
comfort
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
that
God
Almighty
is
so
good
and
just
a
governor
of
the
world
,
that
if
we
have
but
done
our
duties
in
it
,
 
it
will
never
be
enquired
into
,
whether
we
have
done
them
in
a
red
coat
or
a
black
one
:
 
<EOS>
I
hope
not
,
said
the
corporal
 
<EOS>
But
go
on
,
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
with
thy
story
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
went
up
,
continued
the
corporal
,
into
the
lieutenant
's
room
,
which
I
did
not
do
till
the
expiration
of
the
ten
minutes
,
 
he
was
lying
in
his
bed
with
his
head
raised
upon
his
hand
,
with
his
elbow
upon
the
pillow
,
and
a
clean
white
cambrick
handkerchief
beside
it
:
 
<EOS>
The
youth
was
just
stooping
down
to
take
up
the
cushion
,
upon
which
I
supposed
he
had
been
kneeling
,
  
the
book
was
laid
upon
the
bed
,
 
and
,
as
he
rose
,
in
taking
up
the
cushion
with
one
hand
,
he
reached
out
his
other
to
take
it
away
at
the
same
time
.
  
<EOS>
Let
it
remain
there
,
my
dear
,
said
the
lieutenant
.
  
<EOS>
He
did
not
offer
to
speak
to
me
,
till
I
had
walked
up
close
to
his
bed-
side
:
 
<EOS>
If
you
are
captain
Shandy
's
servant
,
said
he
,
you
must
present
my
thanks
to
your
master
,
with
my
little
boy
's
thanks
along
with
them
,
for
his
courtesy
to
me
;
 
if
he
was
of
Levens
's
 
<EOS>
said
the
lieutenant
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
your
honour
was
 
Then
,
said
he
,
I
served
three
campaigns
with
him
in
Flanders
,
and
remember
him
,
 
but
'
tis
most
likely
,
as
I
had
not
the
honour
of
any
acquaintance
with
him
,
that
he
knows
nothing
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
tell
him
,
however
,
that
the
person
his
good
-
nature
has
laid
under
obligations
to
him
,
is
one
Le
Fever
,
a
lieutenant
in
Angus
's
 
<EOS>
but
he
knows
me
not
,
 
said
he
,
a
second
time
,
musing
;
 
possibly
<EOS>
he
may
my
story
 
added
he
 
<EOS>
pray
tell
the
captain
,
I
was
the
ensign
at
Breda
,
whose
wife
was
most
unfortunately
killed
with
a
musket
-
shot
,
as
she
lay
in
my
arms
in
my
tent
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
the
story
,
an't
please
your
honour
,
said
I
,
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
so
?
<EOS>
said
he
,
wiping
his
eyes
with
his
handkerchief
 
then
well
may
I.
 
<EOS>
In
saying
this
,
he
drew
a
little
ring
out
of
his
bosom
,
which
seemed
tied
with
a
black
ribband
about
his
neck
,
and
kiss'd
it
twice
 
<EOS>
Here
,
Billy
,
said
he
,
 
the
boy
flew
across
the
room
to
the
bed
-
side
,
 
and
falling
down
upon
his
knee
,
took
the
ring
in
his
hand
,
and
kissed
it
too
,
 
then
kissed
his
father
,
and
sat
down
upon
the
bed
and
wept
.
  
<EOS>
I
wish
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
with
a
deep
sigh
,
 
I
wish
,
Trim
<EOS>
,
I
was
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
Your
honour
,
replied
the
corporal
,
is
too
much
concerned
;
 
shall
I
pour
your
honour
out
a
glass
of
sack
to
your
pipe
?
 
<EOS>
Do
,
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
  
<EOS>
I
remember
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
sighing
again
,
the
story
of
the
ensign
and
his
wife
,
with
a
circumstance
his
modesty
omitted
;
 
and
particularly
well
that
he
,
as
well
as
she
,
upon
some
account
or
other
(
I
forget
what
)
was
universally
pitied
by
the
whole
regiment
;
 
but
finish
the
story
thou
art
upon
:
 
'
<EOS>
Tis
finished
already
,
said
the
corporal
,
 
for
I
could
stay
no
longer
,
 
<EOS>
so
wished
his
honour
a
good
night
;
young
Le
Fever
rose
from
off
the
bed
,
and
saw
me
to
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
;
and
as
we
went
down
together
,
told
me
,
they
had
come
from
Ireland
,
and
were
on
their
route
to
join
the
regiment
in
Flanders
.
 
<EOS>
But
alas
!
<EOS>
said
the
corporal
,
 
the
lieutenant
's
last
day
's
march
is
over
.
 
<EOS>
Then
what
is
to
become
of
his
poor
boy
?
<EOS>
cried
my
uncle
Toby
.
    
<EOS>
The
Story
of
Le
Fever
Continued
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
to
my
uncle
Toby
's
eternal
honour
,
 
though
I
tell
it
only
for
the
sake
of
those
,
who
,
when
coop'd
in
betwixt
a
natural
and
a
positive
law
,
know
not
,
for
their
souls
,
<EOS>
which
way
in
the
world
to
turn
themselves
 
That
notwithstanding
my
uncle
Toby
was
warmly
engaged
at
that
time
in
carrying
on
the
siege
of
Dendermond
,
parallel
with
the
allies
,
who
pressed
theirs
on
so
vigorously
,
that
they
scarce
allowed
him
time
to
get
his
dinner
 
<EOS>
that
nevertheless
he
gave
up
Dendermond
,
though
he
had
already
made
a
lodgment
upon
the
counterscarp
;
 
and
bent
his
whole
thoughts
towards
the
private
distresses
at
the
inn
;
and
except
that
he
ordered
the
garden
gate
to
be
bolted
up
,
by
which
he
might
be
said
to
have
turned
the
siege
of
Dendermond
into
a
blockade
,
 
he
left
Dendermond
to
itself
 
to
be
relieved
or
not
by
the
French
king
,
as
the
French
king
thought
good
;
and
only
considered
how
he
himself
should
relieve
the
poor
lieutenant
and
his
son
.
    
<EOS>
That
kind
Being
,
who
is
a
friend
to
the
friendless
,
shall
recompence
thee
for
this
.
  
<EOS>
Thou
hast
left
this
matter
short
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
to
the
corporal
,
as
he
was
putting
him
to
bed
,
 
<EOS>
and
I
will
tell
thee
in
what
,
Trim
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
when
thou
madest
an
offer
of
my
services
to
Le
Fever
,
 
as
sickness
and
travelling
are
both
expensive
,
and
thou
knowest
he
was
but
a
poor
lieutenant
,
with
a
son
to
subsist
as
well
as
himself
out
of
his
pay
,
 
that
thou
didst
not
make
an
offer
to
him
of
my
purse
;
because
,
had
he
stood
in
need
,
thou
knowest
,
Trim
,
he
had
been
as
welcome
to
it
as
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Your
honour
knows
,
said
the
corporal
,
I
had
no
orders
;
 
True
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
 
thou
didst
very
right
,
<EOS>
Trim
,
as
a
soldier
,
 
but
certainly
very
wrong
as
a
man
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
second
place
,
for
which
,
indeed
,
thou
hast
the
same
excuse
,
continued
my
uncle
Toby
,
 
<EOS>
when
thou
offeredst
him
whatever
was
in
my
house
,
 
thou
shouldst
have
offered
him
my
house
too
:
 
<EOS>
A
sick
brother
officer
should
have
the
best
quarters
,
Trim
,
and
if
we
had
him
with
us
,
 
we
could
tend
and
look
to
him
:
 
<EOS>
Thou
art
an
excellent
nurse
thyself
,
Trim
,
  
and
what
with
thy
care
of
him
,
and
the
old
woman
's
and
his
boy
's
,
and
mine
together
<EOS>
,
we
might
recruit
him
again
at
once
,
and
set
him
upon
his
legs
.
      
<EOS>
In
a
fortnight
or
three
weeks
,
added
my
uncle
Toby
,
smiling
,
 
he
might
march
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
never
march
;
an
'
please
your
honour
,
in
this
world
,
said
the
corporal
:
 
He
will
march
;
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
rising
up
from
the
side
of
the
bed
,
with
one
shoe
off
:
 
<EOS>
An
'
please
your
honour
<EOS>
,
said
the
corporal
,
he
will
never
march
but
to
his
grave
:
 
<EOS>
He
shall
march
,
cried
my
uncle
Toby
,
marching
the
foot
which
had
a
shoe
on
,
though
without
advanceing
an
inch
,
  
he
shall
march
to
his
regiment
.
 
<EOS>
He
can
not
stand
it
,
said
the
corporal
;
 
He
shall
be
supported
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
;
 
<EOS>
He
'll
drop
at
last
,
said
the
corporal
,
and
what
will
become
of
his
boy
?
 
<EOS>
He
shall
not
drop
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
firmly
.
 
<EOS>
A
-
well
-
o'day
,
 
do
what
we
can
for
him
,
said
Trim
,
maintaining
his
point
,
 
the
poor
soul
will
die
:
 
<EOS>
He
shall
not
die
,
by
G
..
,
cried
my
uncle
Toby
.
    
<EOS>
The
Accusing
Spirit
,
which
flew
up
to
heaven
's
chancery
with
the
oath
,
blush'd
as
he
gave
it
in
;
 
and
the
Recording
Angel
,
as
he
wrote
it
down
,
dropp'd
<EOS>
a
tear
upon
the
word
,
and
blotted
it
out
for
ever

<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
went
to
his
bureau
,
 
put
his
purse
into
his
breeches
pocket
,
and
having
ordered
the
corporal
to
go
early
in
the
morning
for
a
physician

he
went
to
bed
,

fell
asleep

The
Story
of
Le
Fever
Continued

<EOS>
The
sun
looked
bright
the
morning
after
,
to
every
eye
in
the
village
but
<EOS>
Le
Fever
's
and
his
afflicted
son
's
;
the
hand
of
death
pressed
heavy
upon
his
eye
-
lids
,
 
and
hardly
could
the
wheel
at
the
cistern
turn
round
its
circle
,
 
when
my
uncle
Toby
,
who
had
rose
up
an
hour
before
his
wonted
time
,
entered
the
lieutenant
's
room
,
and
without
preface
or
apology
,
sat
himself
down
upon
the
chair
by
the
bed
-
side
,
and
,
independently
of
all
modes
and
customs
,
opened
the
curtain
in
the
manner
<EOS>
an
old
friend
and
brother
officer
would
have
done
it
,
and
asked
him
how
he
did
,
 
how
he
had
rested
in
the
night
,
 
<EOS>
what
was
his
complaint
,
 
<EOS>
where
was
his
pain
,
 
and
what
he
could
do
to
help
him
:
 
and
without
giving
him
time
to
answer
any
one
of
the
enquiries
,
went
on
,
and
told
him
of
the
little
plan
which
he
had
been
concerting
with
the
corporal
the
night
before
for
him
.
      
<EOS>
You
shall
go
home
directly
,
Le
Fever
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
to
my
house
,
  
<EOS>
and
we
'll
send
for
a
doctor
to
see
what
's
the
matter
,
 
and
we
'll
have
an
apothecary
,
 
and
the
corporal
shall
be
your
nurse
;
 
and
<EOS>
I
'll
be
your
servant
,
Le
Fever
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
frankness
in
my
uncle
Toby
,
 
not
the
effect
of
familiarity
,
  
but
the
cause
of
it
,
 
which
let
you
at
once
into
his
soul
,
and
shewed
you
the
goodness
of
his
nature
;
to
this
there
was
something
in
his
looks
,
and
voice
,
and
manner
,
superadded
,
which
eternally
beckoned
to
the
unfortunate
to
come
and
take
shelter
under
him
,
so
that
before
my
uncle
Toby
had
half
finished
<EOS>
the
kind
offers
he
was
making
to
the
father
,
had
the
son
insensibly
pressed
up
close
to
his
knees
,
and
had
taken
hold
of
the
breast
of
his
coat
,
and
was
pulling
it
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
blood
and
spirits
of
Le
Fever
,
which
were
waxing
cold
and
slow
within
him
,
and
were
retreating
to
their
last
citadel
,
the
heart
 
rallied
back
,
 
the
film
forsook
his
eyes
for
a
moment
,
 
<EOS>
he
looked
up
wishfully
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
face
,
 
then
cast
a
look
upon
his
boy
,
 
and
that
ligament
,
fine
as
it
was
,
 
was
never
broken
.
    
<EOS>
Nature
instantly
ebb'd
again
,
 
<EOS>
the
film
returned
to
its
place
,
 
<EOS>
the
pulse
fluttered
 
<EOS>
stopp'd
 
<EOS>
went
on
 
<EOS>
throbb'd
 
stopp'd
<EOS>
again
 
moved

stopp'd

shall
I
go
on
?
 
<EOS>
No

<EOS>
I
am
so
impatient
to
return
to
my
own
story
,
that
what
remains
of
young
Le
Fever
's
,
that
is
,
from
this
turn
of
his
fortune
,
to
the
time
my
uncle
Toby
recommended
him
for
my
preceptor
,
shall
be
told
in
a
very
few
words
in
the
next
chapter
.
 
<EOS>
All
that
is
necessary
to
be
added
to
this
chapter
is
as
follows
.
    
<EOS>
That
my
uncle
Toby
,
with
young
Le
Fever
in
his
hand
,
attended
the
poor
lieutenant
,
as
chief
mourners
,
to
his
grave
.
  
<EOS>
That
the
governor
of
Dendermond
paid
his
obsequies
all
military
honours
,
  
and
that
Yorick
,
not
to
be
behind
-
hand
 
paid
him
all
ecclesiastic
 
for
he
buried
him
in
his
chancel
:
 
<EOS>
And
it
appears
likewise
,
he
preached
a
funeral
sermon
over
him
 
<EOS>
I
say
it
appears
,
 
for
it
was
Yorick
's
custom
,
which
I
suppose
a
general
one
with
those
of
his
profession
,
on
the
first
leaf
of
every
sermon
which
he
composed
,
to
chronicle
down
the
time
,
the
place
,
and
the
occasion
of
its
being
preached
:
 
to
this
<EOS>
,
he
was
ever
wo
nt
to
add
some
short
comment
or
stricture
upon
the
sermon
itself
,
seldom
,
indeed
,
much
to
its
credit
:
 
<EOS>
For
instance
,
This
sermon
upon
the
Jewish
dispensation
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
it
at
all
;
 
<EOS>
Though
I
own
there
is
a
world
of
Water
-
Landish
knowledge
in
it
;
 
but
<EOS>
'
tis
all
tritical
,
and
most
tritically
put
together
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
but
a
flimsy
kind
of
a
composition
;
what
was
in
my
head
when
I
made
it
?
    
<EOS>
N.B.

The
excellency
of
this
text
is
,
that
it
will
suit

sermon

and
of
this
sermon
,
 
that
it
will
suit
any
text
.
      
<EOS>
For
this
sermon
I
shall
be
hanged
,
 
for
I
have
stolen
the
greatest
part
of
it
.

may
gather

from

with
which
he
has
left
us
the
two
sermons
marked
Moderato
,
and
the
half
dozen
of
So
,
so
,
tied
fast
together
in
one
bundle
by
themselves
,
 
<EOS>
one
may
safely
suppose
he
meant
pretty
near
the
same
thing
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
but
one
difficulty
in
the
way
of
this
conjecture
,
which
is
this
,
that
the
moderato
's
are
five
times
better
than
the
so
,
<EOS>
so
's
;
 
show
ten
times
more
knowledge
of
the
human
heart
;
 
have
seventy
times
more
wit
and
spirit
in
them
;
 
(
and
,
to
rise
properly
in
my
climax
)
 
<EOS>
discovered
a
thousand
times
more
genius
;
 
and
to
crown
all
,
are
infinitely
more
entertaining
than
those
tied
up
with
them
:
 
for
which
reason
,
whene'er
Yorick
's
dramatic
sermons
are
offered
to
the
world
,
though
I
shall
admit
<EOS>
but
one
out
of
the
whole
number
of
the
so
,
<EOS>
so
's
,
I
shall
,
nevertheless
,
adventure
to
print
the
two
moderato
's
without
any
sort
of
scruple
.
  
<EOS>
What
Yorick
could
mean
by
the
words
lentamente
,
 
tenute
,
 
grave
,
 
and
sometimes
adagio
,
 
as
applied
to
theological
compositions
,
and
with
which
he
has
characterised
some
of
these
sermons
,
I
dare
not
venture
to
guess
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
more
puzzled
still
upon
finding
a
l'octava
alta
!
<EOS>
upon
one
;
 
Con
strepito
upon
the
back
of
another
;
 
Scicilliana
upon
a
third
;
 
Alla
capella
upon
a
fourth
;
 
Con
l'arco
upon
this
;
 
Senza
l'arco
upon
that
.
 
<EOS>
All
I
know
is
,
that
they
are
musical
terms
,
and
have
a
meaning
;
 
and
as
he
was
a
musical
man
,
I
will
make
no
doubt
,
but
that
by
some
quaint
application
of
such
metaphors
to
the
compositions
in
hand
,
they
impressed
very
distinct
ideas
of
their
several
characters
upon
his
fancy
,
 
whatever
they
may
do
upon
that
of
others
.
  
<EOS>
Amongst
these
,
there
is
that
particular
sermon
which
has
unaccountably
led
me
into
this
digression
 
<EOS>
The
funeral
sermon
upon
poor
Le
Fever
,
wrote
out
very
fairly
,
as
if
from
a
hasty
copy
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
notice
of
it
the
more
,
because
it
seems
to
have
been
his
favourite
composition
 
<EOS>
It
is
upon
mortality
;
and
is
tied
length
-
ways
and
cross
-
ways
with
a
yarn
thrum
,
and
then
rolled
up
and
twisted
round
with
a
half
-
sheet
of
dirty
blue
paper
,
which
seems
to
have
been
once
the
cast
cover
of
a
general
review
,
which
to
this
day
smells
horribly
of
horse
drugs
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
these
marks
of
humiliation
were
designed
,
 
I
something
doubt
;
 
because
at
the
end
of
the
sermon
(
and
not
at
the
beginning
of
it
)
 
very
different
from
his
way
of
treating
the
rest
,
he
had
wrote
 
Bravo
!
    
<EOS>
Though
not
very
offensively
,
 
for
it
is
at
two
inches
,
at
least
,
and
a
half
's
distance
from
,
and
below
the
concluding
line
of
the
sermon
,
at
the
very
extremity
of
the
page
,
and
in
that
right
hand
corner
of
it
,
which
,
you
know
,
is
generally
covered
with
your
thumb
;
and
,
to
do
it
justice
,
it
is
wrote
besides
with
a
crow
's
quill
so
faintly
in
a
small
Italian
hand
,
as
scarce
to
solicit
the
eye
towards
the
place
,
whether
your
thumb
is
there
or
not
,
 
so
that
from
the
manner
of
it
,
it
stands
half
excused
;
and
being
wrote
moreover
with
very
pale
ink
,
diluted
almost
to
nothing
,
 
'
tis
more
like
a
ritratto
of
the
shadow
of
vanity
,
than
of
Vanity
herself
 
of
the
two
;
resembling
rather
a
faint
thought
of
transient
applause
,
secretly
stirring
up
in
the
heart
of
the
composer
;
than
a
gross
mark
of
it
,
coarsely
obtruded
upon
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
With
all
these
extenuations
,
I
am
aware
,
that
in
publishing
this
,
I
do
no
service
to
Yorick
's
character
as
a
modest
man
;
 
but
all
men
have
their
failings
!
<EOS>
and
what
lessens
this
still
farther
,
and
almost
wipes
it
away
,
is
this
;
that
the
word
was
struck
through
sometime
afterwards
(
as
appears
from
a
different
tint
of
the
ink
)
with
a
line
quite
across
it
in
this
manner
,
BRAVO
(
crossed
out
)
 
as
if
he
had
retracted
,
or
was
ashamed
of
the
opinion
he
had
once
entertained
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
These
short
characters
of
his
sermons
were
always
written
,
excepting
in
this
one
instance
,
upon
the
first
leaf
of
his
sermon
,
which
served
as
a
cover
to
it
;
and
usually
upon
the
inside
of
it
,
which
was
turned
towards
the
text
;
 
but
at
the
end
of
his
discourse
,
where
,
perhaps
,
he
had
five
or
six
pages
,
and
sometimes
,
perhaps
,
a
whole
score
to
turn
himself
in
,
 
he
took
a
large
circuit
,
and
,
indeed
,
a
much
more
mettlesome
one
;
 
as
if
he
had
snatched
the
occasion
of
unlacing
himself
with
a
few
more
frolicksome
strokes
at
vice
,
than
the
straitness
of
the
pulpit
allowed
.
 
<EOS>
These
,
though
hussar
-
like
,
they
skirmish
lightly
and
out
of
all
order
,
are
still
auxiliaries
on
the
side
of
virtue
;
 
tell
me
then
,
Mynheer
Vander
Blonederdondergewdenstronke
,
why
they
should
not
be
printed
together
?
    
<EOS>
When
my
uncle
Toby
had
turned
every
thing
into
money
,
and
settled
all
accounts
betwixt
the
agent
of
the
regiment
and
Le
Fever
,
and
betwixt
Le
Fever
and
all
mankind
,
 
there
remained
nothing
more
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
hands
,
than
an
old
regimental
coat
and
a
sword
;
so
that
my
uncle
Toby
found
little
or
no
opposition
from
the
world
in
taking
administration
.
 
<EOS>
The
coat
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
gave
the
corporal
;
 
Wear
it
,
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
as
long
as
it
will
hold
together
,
for
the
sake
of
the
poor
lieutenant
 
<EOS>
And
this
,
 
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
taking
up
the
sword
in
his
hand
,
and
drawing
it
out
of
the
scabbard
as
he
spoke
 
and
this
,
Le
Fever
,
I
'll
save
for
thee
,
  
'
<EOS>
tis
all
the
fortune
,
continued
my
uncle
Toby
,
hanging
it
up
upon
a
crook
,
and
pointing
to
it
,
 
'
<EOS>
tis
all
the
fortune
,
my
dear
Le
Fever
,
which
God
has
left
thee
;
but
if
he
has
given
thee
a
heart
to
fight
thy
way
with
it
in
the
world
,
 
and
thou
doest
it
like
a
man
of
honour
,
 
'
tis
enough
for
us
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
my
uncle
Toby
had
laid
a
foundation
,
and
taught
him
to
inscribe
a
regular
polygon
in
a
circle
,
he
sent
him
to
a
public
school
,
<EOS>
where
,
excepting
Whitsontide
and
Christmas
,
at
which
times
the
corporal
was
punctually
dispatched
for
him
,
 
he
remained
to
the
spring
of
the
year
,
seventeen
;
when
the
stories
of
the
emperor
's
sending
his
army
into
Hungary
against
the
Turks
,
kindling
a
spark
of
fire
in
his
bosom
,
he
left
his
Greek
and
Latin
without
leave
,
and
throwing
himself
upon
his
knees
before
my
uncle
Toby
,
begged
his
father
's
sword
,
and
my
uncle
Toby
's
leave
along
with
it
,
to
go
and
try
his
fortune
under
Eugene
.
 
<EOS>
Twice
did
my
uncle
Toby
forget
his
wound
and
cry
out
,
Le
Fever
!
<EOS>
I
will
go
with
thee
,
and
thou
shalt
fight
beside
me
 
<EOS>
And
twice
he
laid
his
hand
upon
his
groin
,
and
hung
down
his
head
in
sorrow
and
disconsolation
.
    
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
took
down
the
sword
from
the
crook
,
where
it
had
hung
untouched
ever
since
the
lieutenant
's
death
,
and
delivered
it
to
the
corporal
to
brighten
up
;
 
and
having
detained
Le
Fever
a
single
fortnight
to
equip
him
,
and
contract
for
his
passage
to
Leghorn
,
 
he
put
the
sword
into
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
If
thou
art
brave
,
Le
Fever
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
<EOS>
,
this
will
not
fail
thee
,
 
but
Fortune
,
said
he
(
musing
a
little
)
,
 
Fortune
<EOS>
may
 
<EOS>
And
if
she
does
,
 
added
my
uncle
Toby
,
embracing
him
,
come
back
again
to
me
,
Le
Fever
,
and
we
will
shape
thee
another
course
.
  
<EOS>
The
greatest
injury
could
not
have
oppressed
the
heart
of
Le
Fever
more
than
my
uncle
Toby
's
paternal
kindness
;
 
he
parted
from
my
uncle
Toby
,
as
the
best
of
sons
from
the
best
of
fathers
 
both
dropped
tears
 
and
as
my
uncle
Toby
gave
him
his
last
kiss
,
he
slipped
sixty
guineas
,
tied
up
in
an
old
purse
of
his
father
's
,
in
which
was
his
mother
's
ring
,
into
his
hand
,
  
and
bid
God
bless
him
.
    
<EOS>
Le
Fever
got
up
to
the
Imperial
army
just
time
enough
to
try
what
metal
<EOS>
his
sword
was
made
of
,
at
the
defeat
of
the
Turks
before
Belgrade
;
but
a
series
of
unmerited
mischances
had
pursued
him
from
that
moment
,
and
trod
close
upon
his
heels
for
four
years
together
after
;
he
had
withstood
these
buffetings
to
the
last
,
till
sickness
overtook
him
at
Marseilles
,
from
whence
he
wrote
my
uncle
Toby
word
,
he
had
lost
his
time
,
<EOS>
his
services
,
his
health
,
and
,
in
short
,
every
thing
but
his
sword
;
 
and
was
waiting
for
the
first
ship
to
return
back
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
As
this
letter
came
to
hand
about
six
weeks
before
Susannah
's
accident
,
Le
Fever
was
hourly
expected
;
and
was
uppermost
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
mind
all
the
time
my
father
was
giving
him
and
Yorick
a
description
of
what
kind
of
a
person
he
would
chuse
for
a
preceptor
to
me
:
 
<EOS>
but
as
my
uncle
Toby
thought
my
father
at
first
somewhat
fanciful
in
the
accomplishments
he
required
,
he
forbore
mentioning
Le
Fever
's
name
,
 
till
the
character
,
by
Yorick
's
inter
-
position
,
ending
unexpectedly
,
in
one
,
who
should
be
gentle-
tempered
,
and
generous
,
and
good
,
it
impressed
the
image
of
Le
Fever
,
and
his
interest
,
upon
my
uncle
Toby
so
forcibly
,
he
rose
instantly
off
his
chair
;
and
laying
down
his
pipe
,
in
order
to
take
hold
of
both
my
father
's
hands
 
<EOS>
I
beg
,
brother
Shandy

said
my
uncle
Toby
,
I
may
recommend
poor
Le
Fever
's
son
to
you
 
<EOS>
I
beseech
<EOS>
you
do
,
added
Yorick
 
<EOS>
He
has
a
good
heart

said
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
And
a
brave
one
too
,
an

said
the
corporal
.
    
<EOS>
The
best

replied
my
uncle
Toby

<EOS>
And
the
greatest

There

serjeant
Kumber

'll
talk

said
my

another
time

What
a
jovial

a
merry

<EOS>
would
this
be

made
ten
thousand

Could
the

have
been
sued
like

Corporate

my
father
had
brought
an
action
upon
the
case

trounced
it
sufficiently
;
but
to
fall
foul
of
individuals
about
it
 
as
every
soul
who
had
mentioned
the
affair

did
it
with
the
greatest
pity
imaginable

twas
like
flying
in

very
face
of
his
best
friends

<EOS>
And
yet
to
acquiesce
under
the
report
,
in
silence
 
was
to
acknowledge
it
openly
,
 
at
least
in
the
opinion
of
one
half
of
the
world
;
and
to
make
a
bustle
again
,
<EOS>
in
contradicting
it
,
 
was
to
confirm
it
as
strongly
in
the
opinion

other
half

Was

pro'd
and
conn'd
,
and
judicially
talked
over
betwixt
him
and
my
mother
about
a
month
before
,
in
two
several
beds
of
justice
,
which
my
father
had
held
for
that
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
explain
the
nature
of
these
beds
of
justice
in
my
next
chapter
;
and
in
the
chapter
following
that
,
you
shall
step
with
me
,
Madam
,
behind
the
curtain
,
only
to
hear
in
what
kind
of
manner
my
father
and
my
mother
debated
between
themselves
,
this
affair
of
the
breeches
,
 
from
which
you
may
form
an
idea
,
how
they
debated
all
lesser
matters
.
    
<EOS>
The
ancient
Goths
of
Germany
,
who
(
the
learned
Cluverius
is
positive
)
were
first
seated
in
the
country
between
the
Vistula
and
the
Oder
,
and
who
afterwards
incorporated
the
Herculi
,
the
Bugians
,
and
some
other
Vandallick
clans
to
'em
 
<EOS>
had
all
of
them
a
wise
custom
of
debating
every
thing
of
importance
to
their
state
,
twice
,
that
is
,
 
once
drunk
,
and
once
sober
:
  
<EOS>
Drunk
 
<EOS>
that
their
councils
might
not
want
vigour
;
 
and
sober
 
that
they
might
not
want
discretion
.
  
<EOS>
Now
my
father
being
entirely
a
water
-
drinker
,
 
was
a
long
time
gravelled
almost
to
death
,
in
turning
this
as
much
to
his
advantage
,
as
he
did
every
other
thing
which
the
ancients
did
or
said
;
and
it
was
not
till
the
seventh
year
of
his
marriage
,
after
a
thousand
fruitless
experiments
and
devices
,
that
he
hit
upon
an
expedient
which
answered
the
purpose
;
 
and
that
was
,
when
any
difficult
and
momentous
point
was
to
be
settled
in
the
family
,
which
required
great
sobriety
,
and
great
spirit
too
,
in
its
determination
,
 
he
fixed
and
set
apart
the
first
Sunday
night
in
the
month
,
and
the
Saturday
night
which
immediately
preceded
it
,
to
argue
it
over
,
in
bed
with
my
mother
:
 
<EOS>
By
which
contrivance
,
if
you
consider
,
Sir
,
with
yourself
,
.
.
..
  
<EOS>
These
my
father
,
humorously
enough
,
called
his
beds
of
justice
;
 
for
from
the
two
different
counsels
taken
in
these
two
different
humours
,
a
middle
one
was
generally
found
out
which
touched
the
point
of
wisdom
as
well
,
as
if
he
had
got
drunk
and
sober
a
hundred
times
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
not
be
made
a
secret
of
to
the
world
,
that
this
answers
full
as
well
in
literary
discussions
,
as
either
in
military
or
conjugal
;
but
it
is
not
every
author
that
can
try
the
experiment
as
<EOS>
the
Goths
and
Vandals
did
it
  
or
,
if
he
can
,
may
it
be
always
for
his
body
's
health
;
and
to
do
it
,
as
my
father
did
it
<EOS>
,
 
am
I
sure
it
would
be
always
for
his
soul
's
.
  
<EOS>
My
way
is
this
:
    
<EOS>
In
all
nice
and
ticklish
discussions
,
 
(
of
which
,
heaven
knows
,
there
are
but
too
many
in
my
book
)
 
<EOS>
where
I
find
I
can
not
take
a
step
without
the
danger
of
having
either
their
worships
or
their
reverences
upon
my
back
 
<EOS>
I
write
one
-
half
full
,
 
and
t'other
fasting
;
 
or
write
it
all
full
,
 
and
correct
it
fasting
;
 
or
write
it
fasting
,
 
and
correct
it
full
,
for
they
all
come
to
the
same
thing
:
 
<EOS>
So
that
with
a
less
variation
from
my
father
's
plan
,
than
my
father
's
from
the
Gothick
 
<EOS>
I
feel
myself
upon
a
par
with
him
in
his
first
bed
of
justice
,
 
and
no
way
inferior
to
him
in
his
second
.
  
<EOS>
These
different
and
almost
irreconcileable
effects
,
flow
uniformly
from
the
wise
and
wonderful
mechanism
of
nature
,
 
of
which
,
 
be
her
's
the
honour
.
  
<EOS>
All
that
we
can
do
,
is
to
turn
and
work
the
machine
to
the
improvement
and
better
manufactory
of
the
arts
and
sciences
.
    
<EOS>
Now
,
when
I
write
full
,
 
I
write
as
if
I
was
never
to
write
fasting
again
as
long
as
I
live
;
 
that
is
,
I
write
free
from
the
cares
as
well
as
the
terrors
of
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
I
count
not
the
number
of
my
scars
,
 
nor
does
my
fancy
go
forth
into
dark
entries
and
bye
-
corners
to
ante
-
date
my
stabs
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
my
pen
takes
its
course
;
and
I
write
on
as
much
from
the
fulness
of
my
heart
,
as
my
stomach
.
    
<EOS>
But
when
,
an
'
please
your
honours
,
I
indite
fasting
,
'
tis
a
different
history
.
 
<EOS>
I
pay
the
world
all
possible
attention
and
respect
,
 
and
have
as
great
a
share
<EOS>
(
whilst
it
lasts
)
of
that
under
strapping
virtue
of
discretion
as
the
best
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
So
that
betwixt
both
,
I
write
a
careless
kind
of
a
civil
,
nonsensical
,
good
-
humoured
Shandean
book
,
which
will
do
all
your
hearts
good
      
<EOS>
And
all
your
heads
too
<EOS>
,
 
provided
you
understand
it
.
    
<EOS>
We
should
begin
,
said
my
father
,
turning
himself
half
round
in
bed
,
and
shifting
his
pillow
a
little
towards
my
mother
's
,
as
he
opened
the
debate
  
<EOS>
We
should
begin
to
think
,
Mrs.
Shandy
,
of
putting
this
boy
into
breeches
.
    
<EOS>
We
should
so
,
 
said
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
We
defer
it
,
my
dear
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
father
,
shamefully
.
    
<EOS>
I
think
we
do
,
Mr.
Shandy
,
 
said
my
mother
.
    
<EOS>
Not
<EOS>
but
the
child
looks
extremely
well
,
said
my
father
,
in
his
vests
and
tunicks
.
      
<EOS>
He
does
look
very
well
in
them
,
 
replied
my
mother
.
      
<EOS>
And
for
that
reason
it
would
be
almost
a
sin
,
added
my
father
,
to
take
him
out
of
'em
.
      
<EOS>
It
would
so
,
 
said
my
mother
:
 
<EOS>
But
indeed
he
is
growing
a
very
tall
lad
,
 
rejoined
my
father
.
    
<EOS>
He
is
very
tall
for
his
age
,
indeed
,
 
said
my
mother
.
      
<EOS>
I
can
not
(
making
two
syllables
of
it
)
<EOS>
imagine
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
father
,
who
the
deuce
he
takes
after
.
    
<EOS>
I
can
not
conceive
,
for
my
life
,
said
my
mother
.
    
<EOS>
Humph
!
 
<EOS>
said
my
father
.
  
<EOS>
(
The
dialogue
ceased
for
a
moment
.
)
    
<EOS>
(
I
am
very
short
myself
,
 
continued
my
father
gravely
.
  
<EOS>
You
are
very
short
,
Mr.
Shandy
,
 
said
my
mother
.
  
<EOS>
Humph
!
<EOS>
quoth
my
father
to
himself
,
a
second
time
<EOS>
:
 
in
muttering
which
,
he
plucked
his
pillow
a
little
further
from
my
mother
's
,
 
and
turning
about
again
,
there
was
an
end
of
the
debate
for
three
minutes
and
a
half
.
    
<EOS>
When
he
gets
these
breeches
made
,
cried
my
father
in
a
higher
tone
,
he
'll
look
like
a
beast
in
'em
.
  
<EOS>
He
will
be
very
awkward
in
them
at
first
,
replied
my
mother
.
    
<EOS>
And
'
twill
be
lucky
,
<EOS>
if
that
's
the
worst
on't
,
added
my
father
.
  
<EOS>
It
will
be
very
lucky
,
answered
my
mother
.
  
<EOS>
I
suppose
,
replied
my
father
,
 
making
some
pause
first
,
 
he
'll
be
exactly
like
other
people
's
children
.
    
<EOS>
Exactly
,
said
my
mother
.
      
<EOS>
Though
I
shall
be
sorry
for
that
,
added
my
father
:
 
and
<EOS>
so
the
debate
stopp'd
again
.
      
<EOS>
They
should
be
of
leather
,
said
my
father
,
turning
him
about
again
.
    
<EOS>
They
will
last
him
,
said
my
mother
,
the
longest
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
can
have
no
linings
to
'em
,
replied
my
father
.
    
<EOS>
He
can
not
,
said
my
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Twere
better
to
have
them
of
fustian
,
quoth
my
father
.
  
<EOS>
Nothing
can
be
better
,
quoth
my
mother
.
      
<EOS>
Except
dimity
,
 
replied
my
father
:
 
'
Tis
best
of
all
,
 
replied
my
mother
.
    
<EOS>
One
must
not
give
him
his
death
,
however
,
 
interrupted
my
father
.
  
<EOS>
By
no
means
,
said
my
mother
:
 
<EOS>
and
so
the
dialogue
stood
still
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
resolved
,
however
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
father
,
breaking
silence
the
fourth
time
,
he
shall
have
no
pockets
in
them
.
      
<EOS>
There
is
no
occasion
for
any
,
said
my
mother
.
    
<EOS>
I
mean
in
his
coat
and
waistcoat
,
 
cried
my
father
.
    
<EOS>
I
mean
so
too
,
 
replied
my
mother
.
    
<EOS>
Though
if
he
gets
a
gig
or
top
 
Poor
souls
!
<EOS>
it
is
a
crown
and
a
sceptre
to
them
,
 
they
should
have
where
to
secure
it
.
    
<EOS>
Order
it
as
you
please
,
Mr.
Shandy
,
replied
my
mother
.
      
<EOS>
But
do
n't
you
think
it
right
?
<EOS>
added
my
father
,
pressing
the
point
home
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
Perfectly
,
said
my
mother
,
if
it
pleases
you
,
Mr.
Shandy
.
      
<EOS>
There
's
for
you
!
<EOS>
cried
my
father
,
losing
his
temper
 
Pleases
me
!
 
<EOS>
You
never
will
distinguish
,
Mrs.
Shandy
,
nor
shall
I
ever
teach
you
to
do
it
,
betwixt
a
point
of
pleasure
and
a
point
of
convenience
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
on
the
Sunday
night
:
 
and
further
this
chapter
sayeth
not
.
    
<EOS>
After
my
father
had
debated
the
affair
of
the
breeches
with
my
mother
,
 
he
consulted
Albertus
Rubenius
upon
it
;
and
Albertus
Rubenius
used
my
father
ten
times
worse
in
the
consultation
(
if
possible
)
than
even
my
father
had
used
my
mother
:
 
<EOS>
For
as
Rubenius
had
wrote
a
quarto
express
,
De
re
Vestiaria
Veterum
,
 
it
was
Rubenius
's
business
to
have
given
my
father
some
lights
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
my
father
might
as
well
have
thought
of
extracting
the
seven
cardinal
virtues
out
of
a
long
beard
,
 
as
of
extracting
a
single
word
out
of
Rubenius
upon
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
every
other
article
of
ancient
dress
,
Rubenius
was
very
communicative
to
my
father
;
 
gave
him
a
full
satisfactory
account
of
The
Toga
,
or
loose
gown
.
<EOS>
The
Chlamys
.
<EOS>
The
Ephod
.
<EOS>
The
Tunica
,
or
Jacket
.
<EOS>
The
Synthesis
.
<EOS>
The
Paenula
.
<EOS>
The
Lacema
,
with
its
Cucullus
.
<EOS>
The
Paludamentum
.
<EOS>
The
Praetexta
.
<EOS>
The
Sagum
,
or
soldier
's
jerkin
.
<EOS>
The
Trabea
:
of
which
,
according
to
Suetonius
,
there
was
three
kinds
.
      
<EOS>
But
what
are
all
these
to
the
breeches
?
<EOS>
said
my
father
.
  
<EOS>
Rubenius
threw
him
down
upon
the
counter
all
kinds
of
shoes
which
had
been
in
fashion
with
the
Romans
.
    
<EOS>
There
was
,
The
open
shoe
.
<EOS>
The
close
shoe
.
<EOS>
The
slip
shoe
.
<EOS>
The
wooden
shoe
.
<EOS>
The
soc
.
<EOS>
The
buskin
.
<EOS>
And
The
military
shoe
with
hobnails
in
it
,
which
Juvenal
takes
notice
of
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
,
The
clogs
.
<EOS>
The
pattins
.
<EOS>
The
pantoufles
.
<EOS>
The
brogues
.
<EOS>
The
sandals
,
with
latchets
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
,
The
felt
shoe
.
<EOS>
The
linen
shoe
.
<EOS>
The
laced
shoe
.
<EOS>
The
braided
shoe
.
<EOS>
The
calceus
incisus
.
<EOS>
And
The
calceus
rostratus
.
  
<EOS>
Rubenius
shewed
my
father
how
well
they
all
fitted
,
 
in
what
manner
they
laced
on
,
 
with
what
points
,
straps
,
thongs
,
latchets
,
ribbands
,
jaggs
,
and
ends
.
      
<EOS>
But
I
want
to
be
informed
about
the
breeches
,
said
my
father
.
  
<EOS>
Albertus
Rubenius
informed
my
father
that
the
Romans
manufactured
stuffs
of
various
fabrics
,
 
some
plain
,
 
some
striped
,
 
others
diapered
throughout
the
whole
contexture
of
the
wool
,
with
silk
and
gold
 
<EOS>
That
linen
did
not
begin
to
be
in
common
use
till
towards
the
declension
of
the
empire
,
when
the
Egyptians
coming
to
settle
amongst
them
,
brought
it
into
vogue
.
    
<EOS>
That
persons
of
quality
and
fortune
distinguished
themselves
by
the
fineness
and
whiteness
of
their
clothes
;
which
colour
(
next
to
purple
,
which
was
appropriated
to
the
great
offices
)
they
most
affected
,
and
wore
on
their
birth
-
days
and
public
rejoicings
.
 
<EOS>
That
it
appeared
from
the
best
historians
of
those
times
,
that
they
frequently
sent
their
clothes
to
the
fuller
,
to
be
clean'd
and
whitened
:
 
but
that
the
inferior
people
,
to
avoid
that
expence
,
generally
wore
brown
clothes
,
and
of
a
something
coarser
texture
,
 
till
towards
the
beginning
of
Augustus
's
reign
,
when
the
slave
dressed
like
his
master
,
and
almost
every
distinction
of
habiliment
was
lost
,
but
the
Latus
Clavus
.
  
<EOS>
And
what
was
the
Latus
Clavus
?
<EOS>
said
my
father
.
  
<EOS>
Rubenius
told
him
,
that
the
point
was
still
litigating
amongst
the
learned
:
 
That
Egnatius
,
Sigonius
,
Bossius
Ticinensis
,
Bayfius
Budaeus
,
Salmasius
,
Lipsius
,
Lazius
,
Isaac
Casaubon
,
and
Joseph
Scaliger
,
all
differed
from
each
other
,
 
and
he
from
them
:
 
That
some
took
it
to
be
the
button
,
 
some
the
coat
itself
,
 
others
only
the
colour
of
it
;
 
<EOS>
That
the
great
Bayfuis
in
his
Wardrobe
of
the
Ancients
,
chap
.
<EOS>
12
 
<EOS>
honestly
said
,
he
knew
not
what
it
was
,
 
whether
a
tibula
,
 
a
stud
,
 
a
button
,
 
a
loop
,
 
a
buckle
,
 
or
clasps
and
keepers
.
      
<EOS>
My
father
lost
the
horse
,
but
not
the
saddle
 
<EOS>
They

with
hooks

he
ordered
my

to
be
made

<EOS>
We
are
now
going
to
enter
upon
a
new
scene
of
events

<EOS>
Leave
we
<EOS>
then
the
breeches
in
the
taylor

hands
,
with
my
father
standing
over
him
with
his
cane
,
reading
him
as
he
sat
at
work
a
lecture
upon
the
latus
clavus
,
and
pointing
to
the
precise
part
of
the
waistband
,
where
he
was
determined
to
have
it
sewed
on
.
    
<EOS>
Leave
we
my
mother
 
<EOS>
(
truest
of
all
the
Poco
-
curante
's
of
her
sex
!
)
  
<EOS>
careless
about
it
,
as
about
every
thing
else
in
the
world
which
concerned
her
;
 
that
is
,
 
indifferent
whether
it
was
done
this
way
or
that
,
 
provided
it
was
but
done
at
all
.
    
<EOS>
Leave
<EOS>
we
Slop
likewise
to
the
full
profits
of
all
my
dishonours
.
    
<EOS>
Leave
we
poor
Le
Fever
to
recover
,
and
get
home
from
Marseilles
as
he
can
.
 
<EOS>
And
last
of
all
,
 
because
the
hardest
of
all
    
Let
us
leave
,
if
possible
,
myself
:
 
<EOS>
But
'
tis
impossible
,
 
I
must
go
along
with
you
to
the
end
of
the
work
.
    
<EOS>
If
the
reader
has
not
a
clear
conception
of
the
rood
and
the
half
of
ground
which
lay
at
the
bottom
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
kitchen
-
garden
,
and
which
was
the
scene
of
so
many
of
his
delicious
hours
,
 
the
fault
is
not
in
me
,
 
but
in
his
imagination
;
 
for
I
am
sure
I
gave
him
so
minute
<EOS>
a
description
<EOS>
,
I
was
almost
ashamed
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
When
Fate
was
looking
forwards
one
afternoon
,
into
the
great
transactions
of
future
times
,
 
and
recollected
for
what
purposes
this
little
plot
,
by
a
decree
fast
bound
down
in
iron
,
had
been
destined
,
 
she
gave
a
nod
to
Nature
,
 
'
twas
enough
 
<EOS>
Nature
threw
half
a
spade
full
of
her
kindliest
compost
upon
it
,
with
just
so
much
clay
in
it
,
as
to
retain
the
forms
of
angles
and
indentings
,
 
<EOS>
and
so
little
of
it
too
,
as
not
to
cling
to
the
spade
,
and
render
works
of
so
much
glory
,
nasty
in
foul
weather
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
came
down
,
as
the
reader
has
been
informed
,
with
plans
along
with
him
,
of
almost
every
fortified
town
in
Italy
and
Flanders
;
so
let
the
duke
of
Marlborough
,
or
the
allies
,
have
set
down
before
what
town
they
pleased
,
my
uncle
Toby
was
prepared
for
them
.
  
<EOS>
His
way
,
which
was
the
simplest
one
in
the
world
,
was
this
;
as
soon
as
ever
a
town
was
invested
 
<EOS>
(
but
sooner
when
the
design
was
known
)
to
take
the
plan
of
it
(
let
it
be
what
town
it
would
)
,
and
enlarge
it
upon
a
scale
to
the
exact
size
of
his
bowling
-
green
;
upon
the
surface
of
which
,
by
means
of
a
large
role
of
packthread
,
and
a
number
of
small
piquets
driven
into
the
ground
,
at
the
several
angles
and
redans
,
he
transferred
the
lines
from
his
paper
;
then
taking
the
profile
of
the
place
,
with
its
works
,
to
determine
the
depths
and
slopes
of
the
ditches
,
 
the
talus
of
the
glacis
,
and
the
precise
height
of
the
several
banquets
,
parapets
,
&
c.
 
he
set
the
corporal
to
work
 
and
sweetly
went
it
on
:
 
<EOS>
The
nature
of
the
soil
,
 
the
nature
of
the
work
itself
,
 
and
above
all
,
the
good
-
nature
of
my
uncle
Toby
sitting
by
from
morning
to
night
,
and
chatting
kindly
with
the
corporal
upon
past-
done
deeds
<EOS>
,
 
left
Labour
little
else
but
the
ceremony
of
the
name
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
place
was
finished
in
this
manner
,
and
put
into
a
proper
posture
of
defence
,
 
it
was
invested
,
 
and
my
uncle
Toby
and
the
corporal
began
to
run
their
first
parallel
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
<EOS>
I
may
not
be
interrupted
in
my
story
,
by
being
told
,
<EOS>
That
the
first
parallel
should
be
at
least
three
hundred
toises
distant
from
the
main
body
of
the
place
,
 
and
that
I
have
not
left
a
single
inch
for
it
;
 
for
my
uncle
Toby
took
the
liberty
of
incroaching
upon
his
kitchen
-
garden
,
for
the
sake
of
enlarging
his
works
on
the
bowling
-
green
,
and
for
that
reason
generally
ran
<EOS>
his
first
and
second
parallels
betwixt
two
rows
of
his
cabbages
and
his
cauliflowers
;
<EOS>
the
conveniences
and
inconveniences
of
which
will
be
considered
at
large
in
the
history
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
and
the
corporal
's
campaigns
,
of
which
,
this
I
'm
now
writing
is
but
a
sketch
,
and
will
be
finished
,
if
I
conjecture
right
,
in
three
pages
(
but
there
is
no
guessing
)
 
<EOS>
The
campaigns
themselves
will
take
up
as
many
books
;
and
therefore
I
apprehend
it
would
be
hanging
too
great
<EOS>
a
weight
of
one
kind
of
matter
in
so
flimsy
a
performance
as
this
,
to
rhapsodize
them
,
as
I
once
intended
,
into
the
body
of
the
work
 
<EOS>
surely
they
had
better
be
printed
apart
,
 
we
'll
consider
the
affair
 
so
take
the
following
sketch
of
them
in
the
mean
time
.
    
<EOS>
When
the
town
,
with
its
works
,
was
finished
,
my
uncle
Toby
and
the
corporal
began
to
run
their
first
parallel
 
not
at
random
,
or
any
how
 
but
from
the
same
points
and
distances
the
allies
had
begun
to
run
theirs
;
and
regulating
their
approaches
and
attacks
,
by
the
accounts
my
uncle
Toby
received
from
the
daily
papers
,
 
they
went
on
,
during
the
whole
siege
,
step
by
step
with
the
allies
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
duke
of
Marlborough
made
a
lodgment
,
 
my
uncle
Toby
made
a
lodgment
too
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
the
face
of
a
bastion
was
battered
down
,
or
a
defence
ruined
,
 
the
corporal
took
his
mattock
and
did
as
much
,
 
and
so
on
;
 
gaining
ground
,
and
making
themselves
masters
of
the
works
one
after
another
,
till
the
town
fell
into
their
hands
.
  
<EOS>
To
one
who
took
pleasure
in
the
happy
state
of
others
,
 
there
could
not
have
been
a
greater
sight
in
world
,
than
on
a
post
morning
,
in
which
a
practicable
breach
had
been
made
by
the
duke
of
Marlborough
,
in
the
main
body
of
the
place
,
 
to
have
stood
behind
the
horn
-
beam
hedge
,
and
observed
the
spirit
with
which
my
uncle
Toby
,
with
Trim
behind
him
,
sallied
forth
;
  
the
one
with
the
Gazette
in
his
hand
,
 
the
other
with
a
spade
on
his
shoulder
to
execute
the
contents
.
 
<EOS>
What
an
honest
triumph
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
looks
as
he
marched
up
to
the
ramparts
!
 
<EOS>
What
intense
pleasure
swimming
in
his
eye
as
he
stood
over
the
corporal
,
reading
the
paragraph
ten
times
over
to
him
,
as
he
was
at
work
,
lest
,
peradventure
,
he
should
make
the
breach
an
inch
too
wide
,
 
or
leave
it
an
inch
too
narrow
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
the
chamade
was
beat
,
and
the
corporal
helped
my
uncle
up
it
,
and
followed
with
the
colours
in
his
hand
,
to
fix
them
upon
the
ramparts
  
Heaven
!
<EOS>
Earth
!
<EOS>
Sea
!
 
<EOS>
but
what
avails
apostrophes
?
 
<EOS>
with
all
your
elements
,
wet
or
dry
,
ye
never
compounded
so
intoxicating
a
draught
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
track
of
happiness
for
many
years
,
without
one
interruption
to
it
,
except
now
and
then
when
the
wind
continued
to
blow
due
west
for
a
week
or
ten
days
together
,
which
detained
the
Flanders
mail
,
and
kept
them
so
long
in
torture
,
 
but
still
'
twas
the
torture
of
the
happy
 
<EOS>
In
this
track
,
I
say
,
did
my
uncle
Toby
and
Trim
move
for
many
years
,
every
year
of
which
,
and
sometimes
every
month
,
from
the
invention
of
either
the
one
or
the
other
of
them
,
adding
some
new
conceit
or
quirk
of
improvement
to
their
operations
,
which
always
opened
fresh
springs
of
delight
in
carrying
them
on
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
year
's
campaign
was
carried
on
from
beginning
to
end
,
in
the
plain
and
simple
method
I
've
related
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
second
year
,
in
which
my
uncle
Toby
took
Liege
and
Ruremond
,
he
thought
he
might
afford
the
expence
of
four
handsome
draw
-
bridges
;
of
two
of
which
I
have
given
an
exact
description
in
the
former
part
of
my
work
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
latter
end
of
the
same
year
he
added
a
couple
of
gates
with
port-
cullises
:
 
<EOS>
These
last
were
converted
afterwards
into
orgues
,
as
the
better
thing
;
and
during
the
winter
of
the
same
year
,
my
uncle
Toby
,
instead
of
a
new
suit
of
clothes
,
which
he
always
had
at
Christmas
,
treated
himself
with
a
handsome
sentry
-
box
,
to
stand
at
the
corner
of
the
bowling
-
green
,
betwixt
which
point
and
the
foot
of
the
glacis
<EOS>
,
there
was
left
a
little
kind
of
an
esplanade
for
him
and
the
corporal
to
confer
and
hold
councils
of
war
upon
.
    
<EOS>
The
sentry
-
box
was
in
case
of
rain
.
  
<EOS>
All
these
were
painted
white
three
times
over
the
ensuing
spring
,
which
enabled
my
uncle
Toby
to
take
the
field
with
great
splendour
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
would
often
say
to
Yorick
,
that
if
any
mortal
in
the
whole
universe
had
done
such
a
thing
except
his
brother
Toby
,
it
would
have
been
looked
upon
by
the
world
as
one
of
the
most
refined
satires
upon
the
parade
and
prancing
manner
in
which
Lewis
XIV
.
<EOS>
from
the
beginning
of
the
war
,
but
particularly
that
very
year
,
had
taken
the
field
 
<EOS>
But
'
tis
not
my
brother
Toby
's
nature
,
kind
soul
!
<EOS>
my
father
would
add
,
to
insult
any
one
.
    
<EOS>
But
let
us
go
on
.
    
<EOS>
I
must
observe
,
that
although
in
the
first
year
's
campaign
,
the
word
town
is
often
mentioned
,
 
yet
there
was
no
town
at
that
time
within
the
polygon
;
that
addition
was
not
made
till
the
summer
following
the
spring
in
which
the
bridges
and
sentry
-
box
were
painted
,
which
was
the
third
year
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
campaigns
,
 
when
upon
his
taking
Amberg
,
Bonn
,
and
Rhinberg
,
and
Huy
and
Limbourg
,
one
after
another
,
a
thought
came
into
the
corporal
's
head
,
that
to
talk
of
taking
so
many
towns
,
without
one
Town
to
shew
for
it
,
 
was
a
very
nonsensical
way
of
going
to
work
,
and
so
proposed
to
my
uncle
Toby
,
that
they
should
have
a
little
model
of
a
town
built
for
them
,
 
to
be
run
up
together
of
slit
deals
,
and
then
painted
,
and
clapped
within
the
interior
polygon
to
serve
for
all
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
felt
the
good
of
the
project
instantly
,
and
instantly
agreed
to
it
,
but
with
the
addition
of
two
singular
improvements
,
of
which
he
was
almost
as
proud
as
if
he
had
been
the
original
inventor
of
the
project
itself
.
  
<EOS>
The
one
was
,
to
have
the
town
built
exactly
in
the
style
of
those
of
which
it
was
most
likely
to
be
the
representative
:
 
with
grated
windows
,
and
the
gable
ends
of
the
houses
,
facing
the
streets
,
&
c.
&
c.
 
as
those
in
Ghent
and
Bruges
,
and
the
rest
of
the
towns
in
Brabant
and
Flanders
.
  
<EOS>
The
other
was
,
not
to
have
the
houses
run
up
together
,
as
the
corporal
proposed
,
but
to
have
every
house
independent
,
to
hook
on
,
or
off
,
so
as
to
form
into
the
plan
of
whatever
town
they
pleased
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
put
directly
into
hand
,
and
many
and
many
a
look
of
mutual
congratulation
was
exchanged
between
my
uncle
Toby
and
the
corporal
,
as
the
carpenter
did
the
work
.
    
<EOS>
It
answered
prodigiously
the
next
summer
 
<EOS>
the
town
was
a
perfect
Proteus
 
<EOS>
It
was
Landen
,
and
Trerebach
,
and
Santvliet
,
and
Drusen
,
and
Hagenau
,
 
<EOS>
and
then
it
was
Ostend
and
Menin
,
and
Aeth
and
Dendermond
.
    
<EOS>
Surely
never
did
any
Town
act
so
many
parts
,
since
Sodom
and
Gomorrah
,
as
my
uncle
Toby
's
town
did
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
fourth
year
,
my
uncle
Toby
thinking
a
town
looked
foolishly
without
a
church
,
added
a
very
fine
one
with
a
steeple
.
 
<EOS>
Trim
was
for
having
bells
in
it
;
 
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
said
,
the
metal
had
better
be
cast
into
cannon
.
  
<EOS>
This
led
the
way
the
next
campaign
for
half
a
dozen
brass
field
-
pieces
,
to
be
planted
three
and
three
on
each
side
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
sentry
-
box
;
and
in
a
short
time
,
these
led
the
way
for
a
train
of
somewhat
larger
,
 
and
so
on
 
<EOS>
(
as
must
always
be
the
case
in
hobby
-
horsical
affairs
)
from
pieces
of
half
an
inch
bore
,
till
it
came
at
last
to
my
father
's
jack
boots
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
year
,
which
was
that
in
which
Lisle
was
besieged
,
and
at
the
close
of
which
both
Ghent
and
Bruges
fell
into
our
hands
,
 
my
uncle
Toby
was
sadly
put
to
it
for
proper
ammunition
;
 
I
say
proper
ammunition
 
because
his
great
artillery
would
not
bear
powder
;
and
'
twas
well
for
the
Shandy
family
<EOS>
they
would
not
 
For
so
full
were
the
papers
,
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
the
siege
,
of
the
incessant
firings
kept
up
by
the
besiegers
,
  
and
so
heated
was
my
uncle
Toby
's
imagination
with
the
accounts
of
them
,
that
he
had
infallibly
shot
away
all
his
estate
.
  
<EOS>
Something
therefore
was
wanting
as
a
succedaneum
,
especially
in
one
or
two
of
the
more
violent
paroxysms
of
the
siege
,
to
keep
up
something
like
a
continual
firing
in
the
imagination
,
 
and
this
something
,
the
corporal
,
whose
principal
strength
lay
in
invention
,
supplied
by
an
entire
new
system
of
battering
of
his
own
,
 
without
which
,
this
had
been
objected
to
by
military
critics
,
to
the
end
of
the
world
,
as
one
of
the
great
desiderata
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
apparatus
.
  
<EOS>
This
will
not
be
explained
the
worse
,
for
setting
off
,
as
I
generally
do
,
at
a
little
distance
from
the
subject
.
    
<EOS>
With
two
or
three
other
trinkets
,
small
in
themselves
,
but
of
great
regard
,
which
poor
Tom
,
the
corporal
's
unfortunate
brother
,
had
sent
him
over
,
with
the
account
of
his
marriage
with
the
Jew
's
widow
 
there
was
  
A
Montero
-
cap
and
two
Turkish
tobacco
-
pipes
.
  
<EOS>
The
Montero
-
cap
I
shall
describe
by
and
<EOS>
bye
.
 
<EOS>
The
Turkish
tobacco
-
pipes
had
nothing
particular
in
them
,
they
were
fitted
up
and
ornamented
as
usual
,
with
flexible
tubes
of
Morocco
leather
and
gold
wire
,
and
mounted
at
their
ends
,
the
one
of
them
with
ivory
,
 
the
other
with
black
ebony
,
tipp'd
with
silver
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
,
who
saw
all
things
in
lights
different
from
the
rest
of
the
world
,
would
say
to
the
corporal
,
that
he
ought
to
look
upon
these
two
presents
more
as
tokens
of
his
brother
's
nicety
,
than
his
affection
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
did
not
care
,
Trim
,
he
would
say
,
to
put
on
the
cap
,
or
to
smoke
in
the
tobacco
-
pipe
of
a
Jew
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
your
honour
,
the
corporal
would
say
(
giving
a
strong
reason
to
the
contrary
)
 
<EOS>
how
can
that
be
?
  
<EOS>
The
Montero
-
cap
was
scarlet
,
of
a
superfine
Spanish
cloth
,
dyed
in
grain
,
and
mounted
all
round
with
fur
,
except
about
four
inches
in
the
front
,
which
was
faced
with
a
light
blue
,
slightly
embroidered
,
 
and
seemed
to
have
been
the
property
of
a
Portuguese
quarter
-
master
,
not
of
foot
,
but
of
horse
,
as
the
word
denotes
.
  
<EOS>
The
corporal
was
not
a
little
proud
of
it
,
as
well
for
its
own
sake
,
as
the
sake
of
the
giver
,
so
seldom
or
never
put
it
on
<EOS>
but
upon
Gala
-
days
;
and
yet
never
was
a
Montero
-
cap
put
to
so
many
uses
;
for
in
all
controverted
points
,
whether
military
or
culinary
,
provided
the
corporal
was
sure
he
was
in
the
right
,
 
it
was
either
his
oath
,
 
his
wager
,
 
or
his
gift
.
    
<EOS>
'
Twas
his
gift
in
the
present
case
.
  
<EOS>
I
'll
be
bound
,
said
the
corporal
,
speaking
to
himself
,
to
give
away
my
Montero
-
cap
to
the
first
beggar
who
comes
to
the
door
,
if
I
do
not
manage
this
matter
to
his
honour
's
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
The
completion
was
no
further
off
,
than
the
very
next
morning
;
which
was
that
of
the
storm
of
the
counterscarp
betwixt
the
Lower
Deule
,
to
the
right
,
and
the
gate
St.
Andrew
,
 
and
on
the
left
,
between
St.
Magdalen
's
and
the
river
.
  
<EOS>
As
this
was
the
most
memorable
attack
in
the
whole
war
,
 
the
most
gallant
and
obstinate
on
both
sides
,
 
and
<EOS>
I
must
add
the
most
bloody
too
,
for
it
cost
the
allies
themselves
that
morning
above
eleven
hundred
men
,
 
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
prepared
himself
for
it
with
a
more
than
ordinary
solemnity
.
  
<EOS>
The
eve
which
preceded
,
as
my
uncle
Toby
went
to
bed
<EOS>
,
he
ordered
his
ramallie
wig
,
which
had
laid
inside
out
for
many
years
in
the
corner
of
an
old
campaigning
trunk
,
which
stood
by
his
bedside
,
to
be
taken
out
and
laid
upon
the
lid
of
it
,
ready
for
the
morning
;
 
and
the
very
first
thing
he
did
in
his
shirt
,
when
he
had
stepped
out
of
bed
,
my
uncle
Toby
,
after
he
had
turned
the
rough
side
outwards
,
 
put
it
on
:
 
<EOS>
This
done
,
he
proceeded
next
to
his
breeches
,
and
having
buttoned
the
waist
-
band
,
he
forthwith
buckled
on
his
sword
-
belt
,
and
had
got
his
sword
half
way
in
,
 
<EOS>
when
he
considered
he
should
want
shaving
,
and
that
it
would
be
very
inconvenient
doing
it
with
his
sword
on
,
 
so
took
it
off
:
 
<EOS>
In
essaying
to
put
on
his
regimental
coat
and
waistcoat
,
my
uncle
Toby
found
the
same
objection
in
his
wig
,
 
so
that
went
off
too
:
 
So
that
what
with
one
thing
and
what
with
another
,
as
always
falls
out
when
a
man
is
in
the
most
haste
,
 
'
twas
ten
o'clock
,
which
was
half
an
hour
later
than
his
usual
time
,
before
my
uncle
Toby
sallied
out
.
    
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
had
scarce
turned
the
corner
of
his
yew
hedge
,
which
separated
his
kitchen
-
garden
from
his
bowling
-
green
,
when
he
perceived
the
corporal
had
begun
the
attack
without
him
.
    
<EOS>
Let
me
stop
and
give
you
a
picture
of
the
corporal
's
apparatus
;
and
of
the
corporal
himself
in
the
height
of
his
attack
,
just
as
it
struck
my
uncle
Toby
,
as
he
turned
towards
the
sentry
-
box
,
where
the
corporal
was
at
work
,
 
for
in
nature
there
is
not
such
another
,
 
nor
can
any
combination
of
all
that
is
grotesque
and
whimsical
in
her
works
produce
its
equal
.
  
<EOS>
The
corporal
      
Tread
lightly
on
his
ashes
,
ye
men
of
genius
,
 
<EOS>
for
he
was
your
kinsman
:
  
<EOS>
Weed
his
grave
clean
,
ye
men
of
goodness
,
 
for
he
was
your
brother
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
corporal
!
<EOS>
had
I
thee
,
but
now
,
 
now
,
that
I
am
able
to
give
thee
a
dinner
and
protection
,
 
how
would
I
cherish
thee
!
<EOS>
thou
should'st
wear
thy
Montero-
cap
every
hour
of
the
day
,
and
every
day
of
the
week
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
it
was
worn
out
,
I
would
purchase
thee
a
couple
like
it
:
 
<EOS>
But
alas
!
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
now
that
I
can
do
this
in
spite
of
their
reverences
 
<EOS>
the
occasion
is
lost
 
for
thou
art
gone
;
 
thy
genius
fled
up
to
the
stars
from
whence
<EOS>
it
came
;
 
and
that
warm
heart
of
thine
,
with
all
its
generous
and
open
vessels
,
compressed
into
a
clod
of
the
valley
!
    
<EOS>
But
what
 
what
is
this
,
to
that
future
and
dreaded
page
,
where
I
look
towards
the
velvet
pall
,
decorated
with
the
military
ensigns
of
thy
master
 
<EOS>
the
first
 
the
foremost
of
created
beings
;
 
<EOS>
where
,
I
shall
see
thee
,
faithful
servant
!
<EOS>
laying
his
sword
and
scabbard
with
a
trembling
hand
across
his
coffin
,
and
then
returning
pale
as
ashes
to
the
door
,
to
take
his
mourning
horse
by
the
bridle
,
to
follow
his
hearse
,
as
he
directed
thee
;
 
where
 
all
my
father
's
systems
shall
be
baffled
by
his
sorrows
;
and
,
in
spite
of
his
philosophy
,
I
shall
behold
him
,
as
he
inspects
the
lackered
plate
,
twice
taking
his
spectacles
from
off
his
nose
,
to
wipe
away
the
dew
which
nature
has
shed
upon
them
 
When
I
see
him
cast
in
the
rosemary
with
an
air
of
disconsolation
,
which
cries
through
my
ears
,
 
O
Toby
!
<EOS>
in
what
corner
of
the
world
shall
I
seek
thy
fellow
?
    
<EOS>
Gracious
powers
!
<EOS>
which
erst
have
opened
the
lips
of
the
dumb
in
his
distress
,
and
made
the
tongue
of
the
stammerer
speak
plain
 
when
I
shall
arrive
at
this
dreaded
page
,
deal
not
with
me
,
then
,
with
a
stinted
hand
.
    
<EOS>
The
corporal
,
who
the
night
before
had
resolved
in
his
mind
to
supply
the
grand
desideratum
,
of
keeping
up
something
like
an
incessant
firing
upon
the
enemy
during
the
heat
of
the
attack
,
 
had
no
further
idea
in
his
fancy
at
that
time
,
than
a
contrivance
of
smoking
tobacco
against
the
town
,
out
of
one
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
six
field
-
pieces
,
which
were
planted
on
each
side
of
his
sentry
-
box
;
the
means
of
effecting
which
occurring
to
his
fancy
at
the
same
time
,
<EOS>
though
he
had
pledged
his
cap
,
he
thought
it
in
no
danger
from
the
miscarriage
of
his
projects
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
turning
it
this
way
,
and
that
,
a
little
in
his
mind
,
he
soon
began
to
find
out
,
that
by
means
of
his
two
Turkish
tobacco
-
pipes
,
with
the
supplement
of
three
smaller
tubes
of
wash
-
leather
at
each
of
their
lower
ends
,
to
be
tagg'd
by
the
same
number
of
tin
-
pipes
fitted
to
the
touch-
holes
,
and
sealed
with
clay
next
the
cannon
,
and
then
tied
hermetically
with
waxed
silk
at
their
several
insertions
into
the
Morocco
tube
,
 
he
should
be
able
to
fire
the
six
field
-
pieces
all
together
,
and
with
the
same
ease
as
to
fire
one
.
      
<EOS>
Let
no
man
say
from
what
taggs
and
jaggs
hints
may
not
be
cut
out
for
the
advancement
of
human
knowledge
.
 
<EOS>
Let
no
man
,
who
has
read
my
father
's
first
and
second
beds
of
justice
,
ever
rise
up
and
say
again
,
from
collision
of
what
kinds
of
bodies
<EOS>
light
may
or
may
not
be
struck
out
,
to
carry
the
arts
and
sciences
up
to
perfection
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
!
<EOS>
thou
knowest
how
I
love
them
;
 
thou
knowest
the
secrets
of
my
heart
,
and
that
I
would
this
moment
give
my
shirt
 
Thou
art
a
fool
,
Shandy
,
says
Eugenius
,
for
thou
hast
<EOS>
but
a
dozen
in
the
world
,
 
and
<EOS>
'
twill
break
thy
set
.
    
<EOS>
No
matter
for
that
,
Eugenius
;
I
would
give
the
shirt
off
my
back
to
be
burnt
into
tinder
,
were
it
only
to
satisfy
one
feverish
enquirer
,
<EOS>
how
many
sparks
at
one
good
stroke
,
a
good
flint
and
steel
could
strike
into
the
tail
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Think
ye
not
that
in
striking
these
in
,
 
he
might
,
per-
adventure
,
strike
something
out
?
<EOS>
as
sure
as
a
gun
.
      
<EOS>
But
this
project
,
by
the
bye
.
  
<EOS>
The
corporal
sat
up
the
best
part
of
the
night
,
in
bringing
his
to
perfection
;
and
having
made
a
sufficient
proof
of
his
cannon
,
with
charging
them
to
the
top
with
tobacco
,
 
he
went
with
contentment
to
bed
.
    
<EOS>
The
corporal
had
slipped
out
about
ten
minutes
before
my
uncle
Toby
,
in
order
to
fix
his
apparatus
,
and
just
give
the
enemy
a
shot
or
two
before
my
uncle
Toby
came
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
drawn
the
six
field
-
pieces
for
this
end
,
all
close
up
together
in
front
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
sentry
-
box
,
leaving
only
an
interval
of
about
a
yard
and
a
half
betwixt
<EOS>
the
three
,
on
the
right
and
left
,
for
the
convenience
of
charging
,
&
c.
 
and
the
sake
possibly
of
two
batteries
,
which
he
might
think
double
the
honour
of
one
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
rear
and
facing
this
opening
,
with
his
back
to
the
door
of
the
sentry
-
box
,
for
fear
of
being
flanked
,
had
the
corporal
wisely
taken
his
post
:
 
<EOS>
He
held
the
ivory
pipe
,
appertaining
to
the
battery
on
the
right
,
betwixt
the
finger
and
thumb
of
his
right
hand
,
 
and
the
ebony
pipe
tipp'd
with
silver
,
which
appertained
to
the
battery
on
the
left
,
betwixt
the
finger
and
thumb
of
the
other
 
and
with
his
right
knee
fixed
firm
upon
the
ground
,
as
if
in
the
front
rank
of
his
platoon
,
was
the
corporal
,
with
his
Montero
-
cap
upon
his
head
,
furiously
playing
off
his
two
cross
batteries
at
the
same
time
against
the
counter
-
guard
,
which
faced
the
counterscarp
,
where
the
attack
was
to
be
made
that
morning
.
 
<EOS>
His
first
intention
,
as
I
said
,
was
no
more
than
giving
the
enemy
a
single
puff
or
two
;
 
but
the
pleasure
of
the
puffs
,
as
well
as
the
puffing
,
had
insensibly
got
hold
of
the
corporal
,
and
drawn
him
on
from
puff
to
puff
,
into
the
very
height
of
the
attack
,
by
the
time
my
uncle
Toby
joined
him
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Twas
well
for
my
father
,
that
my
uncle
Toby
had
not
his
will
to
make
that
day
.
    
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
took
the
ivory
pipe
out
of
the
corporal
's
hand
,
 
looked
at
it
for
half
a
minute
,
and
returned
it
.
  
<EOS>
In
less
than
two
minutes
,
my
uncle
Toby
took
the
pipe
from
the
corporal
again
,
and
raised
it
half
way
to
his
mouth
 
then
hastily
gave
it
back
a
second
time
.
  
<EOS>
The
corporal
redoubled
the
attack
,
 
my
uncle
Toby
smiled
,
 
then
looked
grave
,
 
then
smiled
for
a
moment
,
 
then
looked
serious
for
a
long
time
;
  
Give
me
hold
of
the
ivory
pipe
,
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
put
it
to
his
lips
,
 
drew
it
back
directly
,
 
gave
a
peep
over
the
horn
-
beam
hedge
;
 
never
did
my
uncle
Toby
's
mouth
water
so
much
for
a
pipe
in
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
retired
into
the
sentry
-
box
with
the
pipe
in
his
hand
.
      
<EOS>
Dear
uncle
Toby
!
<EOS>
do
n't
go
into
the
sentry
-
box
with
the
pipe
,
 
there
's
no
trusting
a
man
's
self
with
such
a
thing
in
such
a
corner
.
    
<EOS>
I
beg
the
reader
will
assist
me
here
,
to
wheel
off
my
uncle
Toby
's
ordnance
behind
the
scenes
,
 
to
remove
his
sentry
-
box
,
and
clear
the
theatre
,
if
possible
,
of
horn
-
works
and
half
moons
,
and
get
the
rest
of
his
military
apparatus
out
of
the
way
;
 
that
done
,
my
dear
friend
Garrick
,
we
'll
snuff
the
candles
bright
,
 
sweep
the
stage
with
a
new
broom
,
 
draw
up
the
curtain
,
and
exhibit
my
uncle
Toby
dressed
in
a
new
character
,
throughout
which
the
world
can
have
no
idea
how
he
will
act
:
 
and
<EOS>
yet
,
if
pity
be
a-
<EOS>
kin
to
love
,
 
and
bravery
no
alien
to
it
<EOS>
,
you
have
seen
enough
of
my
uncle
Toby
in
these
,
to
trace
these
family
likenesses
,
betwixt
the
two
passions
(
in
case
there
is
one
)
to
your
heart
's
content

<EOS>
Vain
science
!
<EOS>
thou
assistest
us
in
no
case
of

kind
 
and
thou
puzzlest
us
in
every
one

<EOS>
There
was
,
Madam
,
in
my
uncle
Toby
,
a
singleness
of
heart
which
misled
him
so
far
out
of
the
little
serpentine
tracks
in
which
things
of
this
nature
usually
go
on
;
you
can
 
<EOS>
you
can
have
no
conception
of
it
:
 
with
this
<EOS>
,
there
was
a
plainness
and
simplicity
of
thinking
,
with
such
an
unmistrusting
ignorance
of
the
plies
and
foldings
of
the
heart
of
woman
;
 
and
so
naked
and
defenceless
<EOS>
did
he
stand
before
you
,
(
when
a
siege
was
out
of
his
head
,
)
that
you
might
have
stood
behind
any
one
of
your
serpentine
walks
,
and
shot
my
uncle
Toby
ten
times
in
a
day
,
through
his
liver
,
if
nine
times
in
a
day
,
Madam
,
had
not
served
your
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
With
all
this
,
Madam
,
 
and
what
confounded
every
thing
as
much
on
the
other
hand
,
my
uncle
Toby
had
that
unparalleled
modesty
of
nature
I
once
told
you
of
,
and
which
,
by
the
bye
,
stood
eternal
sentry
upon
his
feelings
,
that
you
might
as
soon
 
<EOS>
But
where
am
I
going
?
<EOS>
these
reflections
crowd
in
upon
me
ten
pages
at
least
too
soon
,
and
take
up
that
time
,
which
I
ought
to
bestow
upon
facts
.
    
<EOS>
Of
the
few
legitimate
sons
of
Adam
whose
breasts
never
felt
what
the
sting
of
love
was
,
 
(
maintaining
first
,
all
mysogynists
to
be
bastards
,
)
 
the
greatest
heroes
of
ancient
and
modern
story
have
carried
off
amongst
them
nine
parts
in
ten
of
the
honour
;
and
I
wish
for
their
sakes
I
had
the
key
of
my
study
,
out
of
my
draw
-
well
,
only
for
five
minutes
,
to
tell
you
their
names
 
recollect
them
<EOS>
I
can
not
 
so
be
content
to
accept
of
these
,
for
the
present
,
in
their
stead
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
the
great
king
Aldrovandus
,
and
Bosphorus
,
and
Cappadocius
,
and
Dardanus
,
and
Pontus
,
and
Asius
,
 
to
say
nothing
of
the
iron
-
hearted
Charles
the
XIIth
,
whom
the
Countess
of
K
.....
<EOS>
herself
could
make
nothing
of
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
Babylonicus
,
and
Mediterraneus
,
and
Polixenes
,
and
Persicus
,
and
Prusicus
,
not
one
of
whom
(
except
Cappadocius
and
Pontus
,
who
were
both
a
little
suspected
)
ever
once
bowed
down
his
breast
to
the
goddess
 
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
they
had
all
of
them
something
else
to
do
 
<EOS>
and
so
had
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
till
Fate
 
till
Fate
<EOS>
I
say
,
envying
his
name
the
glory
of
being
handed
down
to
posterity
with
Aldrovandus
's
and
the
rest
,
 
<EOS>
she
basely
patched
up
the
peace
of
Utrecht
.
    
<EOS>
Believe
me
,
Sirs
,
'
twas
the
worst
deed
she
did
that
year
.
    
<EOS>
Amongst
the
many
ill
consequences
of
the
treaty
of
Utrecht
,
it
was
within
a
point
of
giving
my
uncle
Toby
a
surfeit
of
sieges
;
and
though
he
recovered
his
appetite
afterwards
,
yet
Calais
itself
left
not
a
deeper
scar
in
Mary
's
heart
,
than
Utrecht
upon
my
uncle
Toby
's
.
 
<EOS>
To
the
end
of
his
life
he
never
could
hear
Utrecht
mentioned
upon
any
account
<EOS>
whatever
,
 
or
so
much
as
read
an
article
of
news
extracted
out
of
the
Utrecht
Gazette
,
without
fetching
a
sigh
,
as
if
his
heart
would
break
in
twain
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
,
who
was
a
great
Motive
-
Monger
,
and
consequently
a
very
dangerous
person
for
a
man
to
sit
by
,
either
laughing
or
crying
,
 
for
he
generally
knew
your
motive
for
doing
both
,
much
better
than
you
knew
it
yourself
  
<EOS>
would
always
console
my
uncle
Toby
upon
these
occasions
,
in
a
way
,
which
shewed
plainly
,
he
imagined
my
uncle
Toby
grieved
for
nothing
in
the
whole
affair
,
so
much
as
the
loss
of
his
hobby
-
horse
.
 
<EOS>
Never
mind
,
brother
Toby
,
he
would
say
,
 
by
God
's
blessing
<EOS>
we
shall
have
another
war
break
out
again
some
of
these
days
;
and
when
it
does
,
 
the
belligerent
powers
,
if
they
would
hang
themselves
,
can
not
keep
us
out
of
play
.
 
<EOS>
I
defy
'em
,
my
dear
Toby
,
he
would
add
,
to
take
countries
without
taking
towns
,
 
or
towns
without
sieges
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
never
took
this
back
-
stroke
of
my
father
's
at
his
hobby
-
horse
kindly
.
 
<EOS>
He
thought
the
stroke
ungenerous
;
and
the
more
so
,
because
in
striking
the
horse
he
hit
the
rider
too
,
and
in
the
most
dishonourable
part
a
blow
could
fall
;
so
that
upon
these
occasions
,
he
always
laid
down
his
pipe
upon
the
table
with
more
fire
to
defend
himself
than
common
.
  
<EOS>
I
told
the
reader
,
this
time
two
years
,
that
my
uncle
Toby
was
not
eloquent
;
and
in
the
very
same
page
gave
an
instance
to
the
contrary
:
 
<EOS>
I
repeat
the
observation
,
and
a
fact
which
contradicts
it
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
eloquent
,
 
it
was
not
easy
to
my
uncle
Toby
to
make
long
harangues
,
 
and
he
hated
florid
ones
;
but
there
were
occasions
where
the
stream
overflowed
the
man
,
and
ran
so
counter
to
its
usual
course
,
that
in
some
parts
my
uncle
Toby
,
for
a
time
,
was
at
least
equal
to
Tertullus
 
but
in
others
,
in
my
own
opinion
,
infinitely
above
him
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
was
so
highly
pleased
with
one
of
these
apologetical
orations
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
,
which
he
had
delivered
one
evening
before
him
and
Yorick
,
that
he
wrote
it
down
before
he
went
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
had
the
good
fortune
to
meet
with
it
amongst
my
father
's
papers
,
with
here
and
there
an
insertion
of
his
own
,
betwixt
two
crooks
,
thus

Justification

Own
Principles

Conduct

Wishing

Continue

<EOS>
I
may
safely
say
,
I
have
read
over
this
apologetical
oration
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
a
hundred
times
,
and
think
it
so
fine
a
model
of
defence
,
 
and
shews
so
sweet
a
temperament
of
gallantry
and
good
principles
in
him
,
that
I
give
it
the
world
,
word
for
word
(
interlineations
and
all
)
,
as
I
find
it

<EOS>
My
Uncle
Toby
's
Apologetical
Oration
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
not
insensible
,
brother
Shandy
,
that
when
a
man
whose
profession
is
arms
,
wishes
,
as
I
have
done
,
for
war
,
 
it
has
an
ill
aspect
to
the
world
;
 
and
that
,
how
just
and
right
soever
<EOS>
his
motives
<EOS>
the
intentions
may
be
,
 
<EOS>
he
stands
in
an
uneasy
posture
in
vindicating
himself
from
private
views
in
doing
it
.
  
<EOS>
For
this
cause
,
if
a
soldier
is
a
prudent
man
,
which
he
may
be
without
being
a
jot
the
less
brave
,
he
will
be
sure
not
to
utter
his
wish
in
the
hearing
of
an
enemy
;
for
say
<EOS>
what
he
will
,
an
enemy
will
not
believe
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
will
be
cautious
of
doing
it
even
to
a
friend
,
 
lest
he
may
suffer
in
his
esteem
:
 
But
if
his
heart
is
overcharged
,
and
a
secret
sigh
for
arms
must
have
its
vent
,
he
will
reserve
it
for
the
ear
of
a
brother
,
who
knows
his
character
to
the
bottom
,
and
what
his
true
notions
,
dispositions
,
and
principles
of
honour
are
:
 
<EOS>
What
,
I
hope
,
I
have
been
in
all
these
,
brother
Shandy
,
would
be
unbecoming
in
me
to
say
:
 
much
worse
,
I
know
,
have
I
been
than
I
ought
,
 
and
something
worse
,
perhaps
,
than
I
think
:
 
But
such
as
I
am
,
you
,
my
dear
brother
Shandy
,
who
have
sucked
the
same
breasts
with
me
,
 
and
with
whom
I
have
been
brought
up
from
my
cradle
,
 
and
from
whose
knowledge
,
from
the
first
hours
of
our
boyish
pastimes
,
down
to
this
<EOS>
,
I
have
concealed
no
one
action
of
my
life
,
and
scarce
a
thought
in
it
 
Such
as
I
am
,
brother
<EOS>
,
you
must
by
this
time
know
me
,
with
all
my
vices
,
and
with
all
my
weaknesses
too
,
whether
of
my
age
,
my
temper
,
my
passions
,
or
my
understanding
.
  
<EOS>
Tell
me
then
,
my
dear
brother
Shandy
,
upon
which
of
them
it
is
,
that
when
I
condemned
the
peace
of
Utrecht
,
and
grieved
the
war
was
not
carried
on
with
vigour
a
little
longer
,
you
should
think
your
brother
did
it
upon
unworthy
views
;
or
that
in
wishing
for
war
,
he
should
be
bad
enough
to
wish
more
of
his
fellow
-
creatures
slain
,
 
more
slaves
made
,
and
<EOS>
more
families
driven
from
their
peaceful
habitations
,
merely
for
his
own
pleasure
:
 
Tell
me
,
brother
Shandy
,
upon
what
one
deed
of
mine
do
you
ground
it
?
 
<EOS>
(
The
devil
a
deed
<EOS>
do
I
know
of
,
dear
Toby
,
but
one
for
a
hundred
pounds
,
which
I
lent
thee
to
carry
on
these
cursed
sieges
.

If
,
when
I
was
a
school
-
boy
,
I
could
not
hear
a
drum
beat
,
but
my
heart
beat
with
it
 
was
it
my
fault
?
 
<EOS>
Did
I
plant
the
propensity
there
?
 
<EOS>
Did
I
sound
the
alarm
within
,
or
Nature
?
  
<EOS>
When
Guy

Earl
of
Warwick
,
and
Parismus
and
Parismenus
,
and
Valentine
and
Orson
,
and
the
Seven
Champions
of
England

were
handed
around
the
school
,
  
were
they
not
all
purchased
with
my
own
pocket
-
money
?
 
<EOS>
Was
that
selfish
,
brother
Shandy
?
 
<EOS>
When
we
read
over
the
siege
of
Troy
,
which
lasted
ten
years
and
eight
months
,
 
though
with
such
a
train
of
artillery
as
we
had
at
Namur
,
the
town
might
have
been
carried
in
a
week
 
was
I
not
as
much
concerned
for
the
destruction
of
the
Greeks
and
Trojans
as
any
boy
of
the
whole
school
?
 
<EOS>
Had
I
<EOS>
not
three
strokes
of
a
ferula
given
me
,
two
on
my
right
hand
,
and
one
on
my
left
,
for
calling
Helena
a
bitch
for
it
?
 
<EOS>
Did
any
one
of
you
shed
more
tears
for
Hector
?
 
<EOS>
And
when
king
Priam
came
to
the
camp
to
beg
his
body
,
and
returned
weeping
back
to
Troy
without
it
,
 
you
know
,
brother
,
I
could
not
eat
my
dinner
.
      
<EOS>
Did
that
bespeak
me
cruel
?
 
<EOS>
Or
because
,
brother
Shandy
,
my
blood
flew
out
into
the
camp
,
and
my
heart
panted
for
war
,
 
<EOS>
was
it
a
proof
it
could
not
ache
for
the
distresses
of
war
too
?
  
<EOS>
O
brother
!
'
<EOS>
tis
one
thing
for
a
soldier
to
gather
laurels
,
 
and
'
tis
another
to
scatter
cypress
.
 
<EOS>
(
Who
told
thee
,
my
dear
Toby
,
that
cypress
was
used
by
the
antients
on
mournful
occasions

<EOS>
'
Tis
one
thing
,
brother
Shandy

for
a
soldier
to
hazard
his
own
life
 
to
leap
first
down
into
the
trench
,
where
he
is
sure
to
be
cut
in
pieces
:
  
'
Tis
one
thing
,
from
public
spirit
and
a
thirst
of
glory
,
to
enter
the
breach
the
first
man
,
 
to
stand
in
the
foremost
rank
,
and
march
bravely
on
with
drums
and
trumpets
,
and
colours
flying
about
his
ears
:
 
'
<EOS>
Tis
one
thing
,
I
say
,
brother
Shandy
,
to
do
this
,
 
and
'
tis
another
thing
to
reflect
on
the
miseries
of
war
;
 
to
view
the
desolations
of
whole
countries
,
and
consider
the
intolerable
fatigues
and
hardships
which
the
soldier
himself
,
the
instrument
who
works
them
,
is
forced
(
for
sixpence
a
day
,
if
he
can
get
it
)
to
undergo
.
  
<EOS>
Need
<EOS>
I
be
told
,
dear
Yorick
,
as
I
was
by
you
,
in
Le
Fever
's
funeral
sermon
,
That
so
soft
and
gentle
a
creature
,
born
to
love
,
to
mercy
,
and
kindness
,
as
man
is
,
was
not
shaped
for
this
?
 
<EOS>
But
why
did
you
not
add
,
Yorick
,
 
if
not
by
Nature
 
that
he
is
so
by
Necessity
?
 
<EOS>
For
what
is
war
?
<EOS>
what
is
it
,
Yorick
,
when
fought
as
ours
has
been
,
upon
principles
of
liberty
,
and
upon
principles
of
honour
 
<EOS>
what
is
it
,
but
the
getting
together
of
quiet
and
harmless
people
,
with
their
swords
in
their
hands
,
to
keep
the
ambitious
and
the
turbulent
within
bounds
?
 
<EOS>
And
heaven
is
my
witness
,
brother
Shandy
,
that
the
pleasure
I
have
taken
in
these
things
,
 
and
that
infinite
delight
,
in
particular
,
which
has
attended
my
sieges
in
my
bowling
-
green
,
has
arose
within
me
,
and
I
hope
in
the
corporal
too
,
from
the
consciousness
we
both
had
,
that
in
carrying
them
on
,
we
were
answering
the
great
ends
of
our
creation
.
    
<EOS>
I
told
the
Christian
reader
 
<EOS>
I
say
Christian
 
hoping
he
is
one
 
<EOS>
and
if
he
is
not
,
I
am
sorry
for
it
 
and
only
beg
he
will
consider
the
matter
with
himself
,
and
not
lay
the
blame
entirely
upon
this
book
    
<EOS>
I
told
him
,
Sir
 
for
in
good
truth
,
when
a
man
is
telling
a
story
in
the
strange
way
I
do
mine
,
he
is
obliged
continually
to
be
going
backwards
and
forwards
to
keep
all
tight
together
in
the
reader
's
fancy
 
which
,
for
my
own
part
,
if
I
did
not
take
heed
to
do
more
than
at
first
,
there
is
so
much
unfixed
and
equivocal
matter
starting
up
,
with
so
many
breaks
and
gaps
in
it
,
 
and
so
little
service
do
the
stars
afford
,
which
,
nevertheless
,
I
hang
up
in
some
of
the
darkest
passages
,
knowing
that
the
world
is
apt
to
lose
its
way
,
with
all
the
lights
the
sun
itself
at
noon
-
day
can
give
it
 
<EOS>
and
now
you
see
,
I
am
lost
myself
!
      
<EOS>
But
'
tis
my
father
's
fault
;
and
whenever
my
brains
come
to
be
dissected
,
you
will
perceive
,
without
spectacles
,
that
he
has
left
a
large
uneven
thread
,
as
you
sometimes
see
in
an
unsaleable
piece
of
cambrick
,
running
along
the
whole
length
of
the
web
,
and
so
untowardly
,
you
can
not
so
much
as
cut
out
a.

<EOS>
.
<EOS>
,
(
here
I
hang
up
a
couple
of
lights
again
)
 
or
a
fillet
,
or
a
thumb

stall
,
but
it
is
seen
or

<EOS>
All
which
being
considered
,
and
that
you
see
'
tis
morally
impracticable
for
me
to
wind
this
round
to
where
I
set
out
    
<EOS>
I
begin
the
chapter
over
again
.
    
<EOS>
I
told
the
Christian
reader
in
the
beginning
of
the
chapter
which
preceded
my
uncle
Toby
's
apologetical
oration
,
 
though
in
a
different
trope
from
what
I
should
make
use
of
now
,
That
the
peace
of
Utrecht
was
within
an
ace
of
creating
the
same
shyness
betwixt
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
and
his
hobby
-
horse
,
<EOS>
as
it
did
betwixt
the
queen
and
the
rest
of
the
confederating
powers
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
an
indignant
way
in
which
a
man
sometimes
dismounts
his
horse
,
which
,
as
good
as
says
to
him
,
"
I
'll
go
afoot
,
Sir
,
all
the
days
of
my
life
before
I
would
ride
a
single
mile
upon
your
back
again
.
"
 
<EOS>
Now
my
uncle
Toby
could
not
be
said
to
dismount
his
horse
in
this
manner
;
for
in
strictness
of
language
,
he
could
not
be
said
to
dismount
his
horse
at
all
 
his
horse
rather
flung
him
 
and
somewhat
viciously
,
which
made
my
uncle
Toby
take
it
ten
times
more
unkindly
.
 
<EOS>
Let
this
matter
be
settled
by
state
-
jockies
as
they
like
.
 
<EOS>
It
created
,
I
say
,
a
sort
of
shyness
betwixt
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
and
his
hobby
-
horse
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
no
occasion
for
him
from
the
month
of
March
to
November
,
which
was
the
summer
after
the
articles
were
signed
,
except
it
was
now
and
then
to
take
a
short
ride
out
,
just
to
see
that
the
fortifications
and
harbour
of
Dunkirk
were
demolished
,
according
to
stipulation
.
  
<EOS>
The
French
were
so
backwards
all
that
summer
in
setting
about
that
affair
,
and
Monsieur
Tugghe
,
the
deputy
from
the
magistrates
of
Dunkirk
,
presented
so
many
affecting
petitions
to
the
queen
,
 
beseeching
her
majesty
to
cause
only
her
thunderbolts
to
fall
upon
the
martial
works
,
which
might
have
incurred
her
displeasure
,
 
but
to
spare
 
to
spare
the
mole
,
for
the
mole
's
sake
;
which
,
in
its
naked
situation
,
could
be
no
more
than
an
object
of
pity
 
and
the
queen
(
who
was
but
a
woman
)
being
of
a
pitiful
disposition
,
  
and
her
ministers
<EOS>
also
,
they
not
wishing
in
their
hearts
to
have
the
town
dismantled
,
for
these
private
reasons
,
.
.
.
 
<EOS>
.
<EOS>
.
.
<EOS>
;
so
that
the
whole
went
heavily
on
with
my
uncle
Toby
;
insomuch
,
that
it
was
not
within
three
full
months
,
after
he
and
the
corporal
had
constructed
the
town
,
and
put
it
in
a
condition
to
be
destroyed
,
that
the
several
commandants
,
commissaries
,
deputies
,
negociators
,
and
intendants
,
would
permit
him
to
set
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
Fatal
interval
of
inactivity
!
  
<EOS>
The
corporal
was
for
beginning
the
demolition
,
by
making
a
breach
in
the
ramparts
,
or
main
fortifications
of
the
town
 
<EOS>
No
,
 
that
will
never
do
,
corporal
<EOS>
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
for
in
going
that
way
to
work
with
the
town
,
the
English
garrison
will
not
be
safe
in
it
an
hour
;
because
if
the
French
are
treacherous
 
<EOS>
They
are
as
treacherous
as
devils
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
said
the
corporal
 
<EOS>
It
gives
me
concern
always
when
I
hear
it
,
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
;
 
for
they
do
n't
want
personal
bravery
;
and
if
a
breach
is
made
in
the
ramparts
,
they
may
enter
it
,
and
make
themselves
masters
of
the
place
when
they
please
:
 
<EOS>
Let
them
enter
it
,
said
the
corporal
,
lifting
up
his
pioneer
's
spade
in
both
his
hands
,
as
if
he
was
going
to
lay
about
him
with
it
<EOS>
,
 
let
them
enter
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
if
they
dare
.
 
<EOS>
In
cases
like
this
,
corporal
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
slipping
his
right
hand
down
to
the
middle
of
his
cane
,
and
holding
it
afterwards
truncheon
-
wise
with
his
fore
-
finger
extended
,
 
'
tis
no
part
of
the
consideration
of
a
commandant
,
what
the
enemy
dare
,
 
or
what
they
dare
not
do
;
he
must
act
with
prudence
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
begin
with
the
outworks
both
towards
the
sea
and
the
land
,
and
particularly
with
fort
Louis
,
the
most
distant
of
them
all
,
and
demolish
it
first
,
 
and
the
rest
,
one
by
one
,
both
on
our
right
and
left
,
as
we
retreat
towards
the
town
;
 
then
we
'll
demolish
the
mole
,
 
<EOS>
next
fill
up
the
harbour
,
 
then
retire
into
the
citadel
,
and
blow
it
up
into
the
air
:
 
and
having
done
that
,
corporal
,
we
'll
embark
for
England
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
there
,
quoth
<EOS>
the
corporal
,
recollecting
himself
 
Very
true
,
said
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
looking
at
the
church
.
    
<EOS>
A
delusive
,
delicious
consultation
or
two
of
this
kind
,
betwixt
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
and
Trim
,
upon
the
demolition
of
Dunkirk
,
 
for
a
moment
rallied
back
the
ideas
of
those
pleasures
,
which
were
slipping
from
under
him
:
 
still
  
<EOS>
still
all
went
on
heavily
 
the
magic
left
the
mind
the
weaker
 
Stillness
,
with
Silence
at
her
back
,
entered
the
solitary
parlour
,
and
drew
their
gauzy
mantle
over
my
uncle
Toby
's
head
;
 
and
Listlessness
,
with
her
lax
fibre
and
undirected
eye
,
sat
quietly
down
beside
him
in
his
arm
-
chair
.
 
<EOS>
No
longer
Amberg
and
Rhinberg
,
and
Limbourg
,
and
Huy
,
and
Bonn
,
in
one
year
,
  
and
the
prospect
of
Landen
,
and
Trerebach
,
and
Drusen
,
and
Dendermond
,
the
next
,
 
hurried
on
the
blood
:
 
No
longer
did
saps
,
and
mines
,
and
blinds
,
and
gabions
,
and
palisadoes
,
keep
out
this
fair
enemy
of
man
's
repose
:
 
No
more
could
my
uncle
Toby
,
after
passing
the
French
lines
,
as
he
eat
his
egg
at
supper
,
from
thence
break
into
the
heart
of
France
,
 
cross
over
the
Oyes
,
and
with
all
Picardie
open
behind
him
,
march
up
to
the
gates
of
Paris
,
and
fall
asleep
with
nothing
but
ideas
of
glory
:
 
<EOS>
No
more
was
he
to
dream
,
he
had
fixed
the
royal
standard
upon
the
tower
of
the
Bastile
,
and
awake
with
it
streaming
in
his
head
.
    
<EOS>
Softer
visions
,
 
gentler
vibrations
stole
sweetly
in
upon
his
slumbers
;
  
<EOS>
the
trumpet
of
war
fell
out
of
his
hands
,
 
he
took
up
the
lute
,
sweet
instrument
!
<EOS>
of
all
others
the
most
delicate
!
<EOS>
the
most
difficult
!
 
<EOS>
how
wilt
thou
touch
it
,
my
dear
uncle
Toby
?
    
<EOS>
Now
,
because
I
have
once
or
twice
said
,
in
my
inconsiderate
way
of
talking
,
That
I
was
confident
the
following
memoirs
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
courtship
of
widow
Wadman
,
whenever
I
got
time
to
write
them
,
would
turn
out
one
of
the
most
complete
systems
,
both
of
the
elementary
and
practical
part
of
love
and
love
-
making
,
that
ever
was
addressed
to
the
world
 
<EOS>
are
you
to
imagine
from
thence
,
that
I
shall
set
out
with
a
description
of
what
love
is
?
<EOS>
whether
part
God
and
part
Devil
,
as
Plotinus
will
have
it
      
<EOS>
Or
by
a
more
critical
equation
,
and
supposing
the
whole
of
love
to
be
as
ten
 
to
determine
with
Ficinus
,
"
How
many
parts
of
it
 
the
one
,
 
and
how
many
the
other
;
"
 
or
whether
it
is
all
of
it
one
great
Devil
,
from
head
to
tail
,
as
Plato
has
taken
upon
him
to
pronounce
;
concerning
which
conceit
of
his
,
I
shall
not
offer
my
opinion
:
 
but
my
opinion
of
Plato
is
this
;
that
he
appears
,
from
this
instance
,
to
have
been
a
man
of
much
the
same
temper
and
way
of
reasoning
with
doctor
Baynyard
,
who
being
a
great
enemy
to
blisters
,
as
imagining
that
half
a
dozen
of
'em
at
once
,
would
draw
a
man
as
surely
to
his
grave
,
as
a
herse
and
six
 
rashly
concluded
,
that
the
Devil
himself
was
nothing
in
the
world
,
but
one
great
bouncing
Cantharidis
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
to
say
to
people
who
allow
themselves
this
monstrous
liberty
in
arguing
,
but
what
Nazianzen
cried
out
(
that
is
,
polemically
)
to
Philagrius
    
"
(
Greek
)
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
O
rare
!
'
<EOS>
tis
fine
reasoning
,
Sir
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
"
(
Greek
)
"
and
most
nobly
do
you
aim
at
truth
,
when
you
philosophize
about
it
in
your
moods
and
passions
.
  
<EOS>
Nor
is
it
to
be
imagined
,
for
the
same
reason
,
I
should
stop
to
inquire
,
whether
love
is
a
disease
,
 
or
embroil
myself
with
Rhasis
and
Dioscorides
,
whether
the
seat
of
it
is
in
the
brain
or
liver
;
 
because
this
would
lead
me
on
,
to
an
examination
of
the
two
very
opposite
manners
,
in
which
patients
have
been
treated
 
the
one
,
of
Aoetius
,
who
always
begun
with
a
cooling
clyster
of
hempseed
and
bruised
cucumbers
;
 
and
followed
on
with
thin
potations
of
water
-
lilies
and
purslane
 
to
which
he
added
a
pinch
of
snuff
,
of
the
herb
Hanea
;
 
and
where
Aoetius
durst
venture
it
,
 
his
topaz-
ring
.
    
<EOS>
The
other
,
that
of
Gordonius
,
who
(
in
his
cap
.
<EOS>
15
.
<EOS>
de
Amore
)
directs
they
should
be
thrashed
,
"
ad
putorem
usque
,
"
 
till
they
stink
again
.
  
<EOS>
These
are
disquisitions
which
my
father
,
who
had
laid
in
a
great
stock
of
knowledge
of
this
kind
,
will
be
very
busy
with
in
the
progress
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
affairs
:
 
<EOS>
I
must
anticipate
thus
much
,
That
from
his
theories
of
love
,
(
with
which
,
by
the
way
,
he
contrived
to
crucify
my
uncle
Toby
's
mind
,
almost
as
much
as
his
amours
themselves
,
)
 
<EOS>
he
took
a
single
step
into
practice
;
 
and
by
means
of
a
camphorated
cerecloth
,
which
he
found
means
to
impose
upon
the
taylor
for
buckram
,
whilst
he
was
making
my
uncle
Toby
a
new
pair
of
breeches
,
he
produced
Gordonius
's
effect
upon
my
uncle
Toby
without
the
disgrace
.
  
<EOS>
What
changes
this
produced
,
will
be
read
in
its
proper
place
:
 
all
that
is
needful
to
be
added
to
the
anecdote
,
is
this
 
That
whatever
effect
it
had
upon
my
uncle
Toby
,
 
it
had
a
vile
effect
upon
the
house
;
 
and
if
my
uncle
Toby
had
not
smoaked
it
down
as
he
did
,
it
might
have
had
a
vile
effect
upon
my
father
too
.
      
<EOS>
'
Twill
come
out
of
itself
by
and
bye
.
 
<EOS>
All
I
contend
for
is
,
that
I
am
not
obliged
to
set
out
with
a
definition
of
what
love
is
;
and
so
long
as
I
can
go
on
with
my
story
intelligibly
,
with
the
help
of
the
word
itself
,
without
any
other
idea
to
it
,
than
what
I
have
in
common
with
the
rest
of
the
world
<EOS>
,
why
should
I
differ
from
it
a
moment
before
the
time
?
 
<EOS>
When
I
can
get
on
no
further
,
 
and
find
myself
entangled
on
all
sides
of
this
mystic
labyrinth
,
 
my
Opinion
will
then
come
in
,
in
course
,
 
and
lead
me
out
.
  
<EOS>
At
present
,
I
hope
I
shall
be
sufficiently
understood
,
in
telling
the
reader
,
my
uncle
Toby
fell
in
love
:
    
<EOS>
Not
that
the
phrase
is
at
all
to
my
liking
:
for
to
say
a
man
is
fallen
in
love
,
 
or
that
he
is
deeply
in
love
,
 
or
up
to
the
ears
in
love
,
 
and
sometimes
even
over
head
and
ears
in
it
,
 
carries
an
idiomatical
kind
of
implication
,
that
love
is
a
thing
below
a
man
:
 
<EOS>
this
is
recurring
again
to
Plato
's
opinion
,
which
,
with
all
his
divinityship
,
 
I
hold
to
be
damnable
and
heretical
:
 
and
so
much
for
that
.
  
<EOS>
Let
love
therefore
be
what
it
will
,
 
my
uncle
Toby
fell
into
it
.
    
<EOS>
And
possibly
,
gentle
reader
,
with
such
a
temptation
 
so
wouldst
thou
:
 
<EOS>
For
never
did
thy
eyes
behold
,
or
thy
concupiscence
covet
any
thing
in
this
world
,
more
concupiscible
than
widow
Wadman
.

As
Susannah
was
informed
by
an
express
from
Mrs.
Bridget
,
of
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
's
falling
in
love
with
her
mistress
fifteen
days
before
it
happened
,
  
the
contents
of
which
express
,
Susannah
communicated
to
my
mother
the
next
day
,
 
it
has
just
given
me
an
opportunity
of
entering
upon
my
uncle
Toby
's
amours
a
fortnight
before
their
existence
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
an
article
of
news
to
tell
you
,
Mr.
Shandy
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
mother
,
which
will
surprise
you
greatly
.
    
<EOS>
Now
my
father
was
then
holding
one
of
his
second
beds
of
justice
,
and
was
musing
within
himself
about
the
hardships
of
matrimony
,
as
my
mother
broke
silence
.
    
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
My
brother
Toby
,
"
quoth
she
,
"
is
going
to
be
married
to
Mrs.
Wadman
.
"
    
<EOS>
Then
he
will
never
,
quoth
my
father
,
be
able
to
lie
diagonally
in
his
bed
again
as
long
as
he
lives
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
consuming
vexation
to
my
father
,
that
my
mother
never
asked
the
meaning
of
a
thing
she
did
not
understand
.
    
<EOS>
That
she
is
not
a
woman
of
science
,
my
father
would
say
 
is
her
misfortune
 
<EOS>
but
she
might
ask
a
question
.
    
<EOS>
My
mother
never
did
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
she
went
out
of
the
world
at
last
without
knowing
whether
it
turned
round
,
or
stood
still
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
had
officiously
told
her
above
a
thousand
times
which
way
it
was
,
 
<EOS>
but
she
always
forgot
.
  
<EOS>
For
these
reasons
,
a
discourse
seldom
went
on
<EOS>
much
further
betwixt
them
,
than
a
proposition
,
 
a
reply
,
and
a
rejoinder
;
at
the
end
of
which
,
it
generally
took
breath
for
a
few
minutes
(
as
in
the
affair
of
the
breeches
)
,
and
then
went
on
again
.
  
<EOS>
If
he
marries
,
'
twill
be
the
worse
for
us
,
 
<EOS>
quoth
my
mother
.
  
<EOS>
Not
a
cherry
-
stone
,
said
my
father
,
 
he
may
as
well
batter
away
his
means
upon
that
,
as
any
thing
else
,
    
To
be
sure
<EOS>
,
said
my
mother
:
 
<EOS>
so
here
ended
the
proposition
 
<EOS>
the
reply
,
  
and
the
rejoinder
<EOS>
,
I
told
you
of
.
  
<EOS>
It
will
be
some
amusement
to
him
,
too
,
 
said
my
father
.
  
<EOS>
A
very
great
one
,
answered
my
mother
,
if
he
should
have
children
.
      
<EOS>
Lord
have
mercy
upon
me
,
 
said
my
father
to
himself
 
.
.
<EOS>
..
    
<EOS>
I
am
now
beginning
to
get
fairly
into
my
work
;
and
by
the
help
of
a
vegetable
diet
,
with
a
few
of
the
cold
seeds
,
I
make
no
doubt
<EOS>
but
I
shall
be
able
to
go
on
with
my
uncle
Toby
's
story
,
and
my
own
,
in
a
tolerable
straight
line
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
  
(
four
very
squiggly
lines
across
the
page
signed
Inv
.
<EOS>
T.S
and
Scw
.
<EOS>
T.S
)
  
<EOS>
These
were
the
four
lines
I
moved
in
through
my
first
,
second
,
third
,
and
fourth
volumes
(
Alluding
to
the
first
edition
.
)
 
<EOS>
In
the
fifth
volume
I
have
been
very
good
,
 
the
precise
line
I
have
described
in
it
being
this
:
  
(
one
very
squiggly
line
across
the
page
with
loops
marked
A
,
B
,
C
,
C
,
C
,
C
,
C
,
D
)
  
<EOS>
By
which
it
appears
,
that
except
at
the
curve
,
marked
A.
where
I
took
a
trip
to
Navarre
,
 
and
the
indented
curve
B.
which
is
the
short
airing
when
I
was
there
with
the
Lady
Baussiere
and
her
page
,
 
I
have
not
taken
the
least
frisk
of
a
digression
,
till
John
de
<EOS>
la
Casse
's
devils
led
me
the
round
you
see
marked
D.
 
for
as
for
C
C
C
C
C
<EOS>
they
are
nothing
but
parentheses
,
and
the
common
ins
and
outs
incident
to
the
lives
of
the
greatest
ministers
of
state
;
and
when
compared
with
what
men
have
done
,
 
or
with
my
own
transgressions
at
the
letters
<EOS>
ABD
 
<EOS>
they
vanish
into
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
last
volume
I
have
done
better
still
 
for
from
the
end
of
Le
Fever
's
episode
,
to
the
beginning
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
campaigns
,
 
I
have
scarce
stepped
a
yard
out
of
my
way
.
  
<EOS>
If
I
mend
at
this
rate
,
it
is
not
impossible
 
by
the
good
leave
of
his
grace
of
Benevento
's
devils
 
<EOS>
but
I
may
arrive
hereafter
at
the
excellency
of
going
on
even
thus
:
  
(
straight
line
across
the
page
)
  
<EOS>
which
is
a
line
drawn
as
straight
as
I
could
draw
it
,
by
a
writing
-
master
's
ruler
(
borrowed
for
that
purpose
)
,
turning
neither
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
.
  
<EOS>
This
right
line
,
 
the
path
-
way
for
Christians
to
walk
in
!
<EOS>
say
divines
      
<EOS>
The
emblem
of
moral
rectitude
!
<EOS>
says
Cicero
      
<EOS>
The
best
line
!
<EOS>
say
cabbage
planters
 
is
the
shortest
line
,
says
Archimedes
,
which
can
be
drawn
from
one
given
point
to
another
.
    
<EOS>
I
wish
your
ladyships
would
lay
this
matter
to
heart
,
in
your
next
birth-
day
suits
!
    
<EOS>
What
a
journey
!
  
<EOS>
Pray
can
you
tell
me
,
 
that
is
,
without
anger
,
before
I
write
my
chapter
upon
straight
lines
 
by
what
mistake
 
who
told
them
<EOS>
so
 
or
how
it
has
come
to
pass
,
that
your
men
of
wit
and
genius
have
all
along
confounded
this
line
,
with
the
line
of
Gravitation
?
    
<EOS>
No
 
<EOS>
I
think
,
I
said
,
I
would
write
two
volumes
every
year
,
provided
the
vile
cough
which
then
tormented
me
,
and
which
to
this
hour
I
dread
worse
than
the
devil
,
would
but
give
me
leave
 
and
in
another
place
 
<EOS>
(
but
where
,
I
ca
n't
recollect
now
)
speaking
of
my
book
as
a
machine
,
and
laying
my
pen
and
ruler
down
cross
-
wise
upon
the
table
,
in
order
to
gain
the
greater
credit
to
it
 
<EOS>
I
swore
it
should
be
kept
a
going
at
that
rate
these
forty
years
,
if
it
pleased
but
the
fountain
of
life
to
bless
me
so
long
with
health
and
good
spirits
.
  
<EOS>
Now
as
for
my
spirits
,
little
have
I
to
lay
to
their
charge
 
<EOS>
nay
<EOS>
so
very
little
(
unless
the
mounting
me
upon
a
long
stick
and
playing
the
fool
with
me
nineteen
hours
out
of
the
twenty
-
four
<EOS>
,
be
accusations
)
<EOS>
that
on
the
contrary
,
I
have
much
 
much
to
thank
'em
for
:
 
cheerily
have
ye
made
me
tread
the
path
of
life
with
all
the
burthens
of
it
(
except
its
cares
)
upon
my
back
;
in
no
one
moment
of
my
existence
,
that
I
remember
,
have
ye
once
deserted
me
,
or
tinged
the
objects
which
came
in
my
way
,
either
with
sable
,
or
with
a
sickly
green
;
in
dangers
ye
gilded
my
horizon
with
hope
,
and
when
Death
himself
knocked
at
my
door
 
<EOS>
ye
bad
<EOS>
him
come
again
;
and
in
so
gay
<EOS>
a
tone
of
careless
indifference
<EOS>
,
did
ye
do
it
,
that
he
doubted
of
his
commission
    
"
 
<EOS>
There
must
certainly
be
some
mistake
in
this
matter
,
"
quoth
he
.
  
<EOS>
Now
there
is
nothing
in
this
world
I
abominate
worse
,
than
to
be
interrupted
in
a
story
 
<EOS>
and
I
was
that
moment
<EOS>
telling
Eugenius
a
most
tawdry
one
in
my
way
,
of
a
nun
who
fancied
herself
a
shell
-
fish
,
and
of
a
monk
damn'd
for
eating
a
muscle
,
and
was
shewing
him
the
grounds
and
justice
of
the
procedure
    
<EOS>
"
 
Did
ever
so
grave
a
personage
get
into
so
vile
a
scrape
?
"
<EOS>
quoth
Death
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
hast
had
a
narrow
escape
,
Tristram
,
said
Eugenius
,
taking
hold
of
my
hand
as
I
finished
my
story
    
<EOS>
But
there
is
no
living
,
Eugenius
,
replied
I
,
at
this
rate
;
for
as
this
son
of
a
whore
has
found
out
my
lodgings
      
<EOS>
You
call
him
rightly
,
said
Eugenius
,
 
for
by
sin
,
we
are
told
,
he
enter'd
<EOS>
the
world
 
<EOS>
I
care
not
<EOS>
which
way
<EOS>
he
enter'd
,
quoth
<EOS>
I
,
provided
he
be
not
in
such
a
hurry
to
take
me
out
with
him
 
for
I
have
forty
volumes
to
write
,
and
forty
thousand
things
to
say
and
do
which
no
body
in
the
world
will
say
and
do
for
me
,
except
thyself
;
and
as
thou
seest
he
has
got
me
by
the
throat
(
for
Eugenius
could
scarce
hear
me
speak
across
the
table
)
,
and
that
I
am
no
match
for
him
in
the
open
field
,
<EOS>
had
I
not
better
,
whilst
these
few
scatter'd
spirits
remain
,
and
these
two
spider
legs
of
mine
(
holding
one
of
them
up
to
him
)
are
able
to
support
me
 
<EOS>
had
I
not
better
,
Eugenius
,
fly
for
my
life
?
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
my
advice
,
my
dear
Tristram
,
said
<EOS>
Eugenius
 
<EOS>
Then
by
heaven
!
<EOS>
I
will
lead
him
a
dance
he
little
thinks
of
 
for
I
will
gallop
,
quoth
<EOS>
I
,
without
looking
once
behind
me
,
to
the
banks
of
the
Garonne
;
and
if
I
hear
him
clattering
at
my
heels
 
<EOS>
I
'll
scamper
away
to
mount
Vesuvius
 
from
thence
to
Joppa
,
and
from
Joppa
to
the
world
's
end
;
where
,
if
he
follows
me
,
I
pray
God
he
may
break
his
neck
      
<EOS>
He
runs
more
risk
there
,
said
Eugenius
,
than
thou
.
  
<EOS>
Eugenius
's
wit
and
affection
brought
blood
into
the
cheek
from
whence
<EOS>
it
had
been
some
months
<EOS>
banish'd
 
<EOS>
'
twas
a
vile
moment
to
bid
adieu
in
;
he
led
me
to
my
chaise
 
Allons
!
<EOS>
said
I
;
the
post
-
boy
gave
a
crack
with
his
whip
  
off
<EOS>
I
went
like
a
cannon
,
and
in
half
a
dozen
bounds
got
into
Dover
.
    
<EOS>
Now
hang
it
!
<EOS>
quoth
<EOS>
I
,
as
I
look'd
towards
the
French
coast
 
a
man
should
know
something
of
his
own
country
too
,
before
he
goes
abroad
 
<EOS>
and
I
never
gave
a
peep
into
Rochester
church
,
or
took
notice
of
the
dock
of
Chatham
,
or
visited
St.
Thomas
at
Canterbury
,
though
they
all
three
laid
in
my
way
      
<EOS>
But
mine
,
indeed
,
is
a
particular
case
    
<EOS>
So
without
arguing
the
matter
further
with
Thomas
o'Becket
,
or
any
one
else
 
<EOS>
I
skip'd
into
the
boat
,
and
<EOS>
in
five
minutes
we
got
under
sail
,
and
scudded
away
like
the
wind
.
  
<EOS>
Pray
,
captain
,
<EOS>
quoth
<EOS>
I
,
as
I
was
going
down
into
the
cabin
,
is
a
man
never
overtaken
by
Death
in
this
passage
?
  
<EOS>
Why
,
there
is
not
time
for
a
man
to
be
sick
in
it
,
replied
he
 
<EOS>
What
a
cursed
lyar
!
<EOS>
for
I
am
sick
as
a
horse
,
quoth
<EOS>
I

already
 
what
a
brain
!
  
<EOS>
upside
down
!
 
<EOS>
hey
-
day

<EOS>
the
cells
are
broke
loose
one
into
another
,
and
the
blood
,
and
the
lymph
,
and
the
nervous
juices
,
with
the
fix'd
and
volatile
salts
,
are
all
jumbled
into
one
mass
 
good
G

<EOS>
every
thing
turns
round
in

I
'd
give

to
know
if

write
the
clearer
for
it
    
<EOS>
Sick

<EOS>
sick

<EOS>
sick

<EOS>
sick

<EOS>
When
shall
we
get
to

<EOS>
captain
 
<EOS>
they
have
hearts
like

<EOS>
O
I
am
deadly
sick

<EOS>
reach
me
that
thing

boy
 
<EOS>

tis
the
most
discomfiting
sickness

then
I
shall
meet
him
full
in

What

<EOS>
'
tis
chopp'd
about

O
the

chop
it
    
<EOS>
Captain
,
quoth
<EOS>
she
,
for
heaven
's
sake
,
let
us
get
ashore
.
    
<EOS>
It
is
a
great
inconvenience
to
a
man
in
a
haste
,
that
there
are
three
distinct
roads
between
Calais
and
Paris
,
in
behalf
of
which
there
is
so
much
to
be
said
by
the
several
deputies
from
the
towns
which
lie
along
them
,
that
half
a
day
is
easily
lost
in
settling
which
you
'll
take
.
  
<EOS>
First
,
the
road
by
Lisle
and
Arras
,
which
is
the
most
about
 
but
most
interesting
,
and
instructing
.
  
<EOS>
The
second
,
that
by
Amiens
,
which
you
may
go
,
if
you
would
see
Chantilly
    
And
that
by
Beauvais
,
which
you
may
go
,
if
you
will
.
  
<EOS>
For
this
reason
a
great
many
chuse
to
go
by
Beauvais
.
    
<EOS>
"
Now
before
I
quit
Calais
,
"
a
travel
-
writer
would
say
,
"
it
would
not
be
amiss
to
give
some
account
of
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
Now
I
think
it
very
much
<EOS>
amiss
 
that
a
man
can
not
go
quietly
through
a
town
and
let
it
alone
,
when
it
does
not
meddle
with
him
,
but
that
he
must
be
turning
about
and
drawing
his
pen
at
every
kennel
he
crosses
over
,
merely
o
'
my
conscience
for
the
sake
of
drawing
it
;
because
,
if
we
may
judge
from
what
has
been
wrote
of
these
things
,
by
all
who
have
wrote
and
gallop'd
 
or
who
have
gallop'd
and
wrote
,
which
is
a
different
way
still
;
or
who
,
for
more
expedition
than
the
rest
,
have
wrote
galloping
,
which
is
the
way
I
do
at
present
 
from
the
great
Addison
,
who
did
it
with
his
satchel
of
school
books
hanging
at
his
a.
.
.
,
and
galling
his
beast
's
crupper
at
every
stroke
 
<EOS>
there
is
not
a
gallopper
of
us
all
who
might
not
have
gone
on
ambling
quietly
in
his
own
ground
(
in
case
he
had
any
)
,
and
have
wrote
all
he
had
to
write
,
dry
-
shod
,
as
well
as
not
.
  
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
as
heaven
is
my
judge
,
and
to
which
I
shall
ever
make
my
last
appeal
 
<EOS>
I
know
no
more
of
Calais
(
except
the
little
my
barber
told
me
of
it
as
he
was
whetting
his
razor
)
than
I
do
this
moment
of
Grand
Cairo
;
for
it
was
dusky
in
the
evening
when
I
landed
,
and
dark
as
pitch
in
the
morning
when
I
set
out
,
and
yet
by
merely
knowing
what
is
what
,
and
by
drawing
this
from
that
in
one
part
of
the
town
,
and
by
spelling
and
putting
this
and
that
together
in
another
 
I
would
lay
any
travelling
odds
,
that
I
this
moment
write
a
chapter
upon
Calais
as
long
as
my
arm
;
and
with
so
distinct
and
satisfactory
a
detail
of
every
item
,
which
is
worth
a
stranger
's
curiosity
in
the
town
 
that
you
would
take
me
for
the
town
-
clerk
of
Calais
itself
 
and
where
,
sir
,
would
be
the
wonder
?
<EOS>
was
not
Democritus
,
who
laughed
ten
times
more
than
I
 
town
-
clerk
of
Abdera
?
<EOS>
and
was
not
<EOS>
(
I
forget
his
name
)
who
had
more
discretion
than
us
both
,
town
-
clerk
of
Ephesus
?
 
<EOS>
it
should
be
penn'd
<EOS>
moreover
,
sir
,
with
so
much
knowledge
and
good
sense
,
and
truth
,
and
precision
      
Nay
 
if
you
do
n't
believe
me
,
you
may
read
the
chapter
for
your
pains
.
    
<EOS>
Calais
,
Calatium
,
Calusium
,
Calesium
.
  
<EOS>
This
town
,
if
we
may
trust
its
archives
,
the
authority
of
which
I
see
no
reason
to
call
in
question
in
this
place
 
was
once
no
more
than
a
small
village
belonging
to
one
of
the
first
Counts
de
Guignes
;
and
as
it
boasts
at
present
of
no
less
than
fourteen
thousand
inhabitants
,
exclusive
of
four
hundred
and
twenty
distinct
families
in
the
basse
ville
,
or
suburbs
 
it
must
have
grown
up
by
little
and
little
,
I
suppose
,
to
its
present
size
.
  
<EOS>
Though
there
are
four
convents
,
there
is
but
one
parochial
church
in
the
whole
town
;
I
had
not
an
opportunity
of
taking
its
exact
dimensions
,
but
it
is
pretty
easy
to
make
a
tolerable
conjecture
of
'em
 
for
as
there
are
fourteen
thousand
inhabitants
in
the
town
,
if
the
church
holds
them
all
it
must
be
considerably
large
 
and
if
it
will
not
 
'
tis
a
very
great
pity
they
have
not
another
 
<EOS>
it
is
built
in
form
of
a
cross
,
and
dedicated
to
the
Virgin
Mary
;
the
steeple
,
which
has
a
spire
to
it
,
is
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
church
,
and
stands
upon
four
pillars
elegant
and
light
enough
,
but
sufficiently
strong
at
the
same
time
 
it
is
decorated
with
eleven
altars
,
most
of
which
are
rather
fine
than
beautiful
.
 
<EOS>
The
great
altar
is
a
master-
piece
in
its
kind
;
'
tis
of
white
marble
,
and
,
as
I
was
told
,
near
sixty
feet
high
 
<EOS>
had
it
been
much
higher
<EOS>
,
it
had
been
as
high
as
mount
Calvary
itself
 
therefore
,
I
suppose
it
must
be
high
enough
in
all
conscience
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
struck
me
more
than
the
great
Square
;
tho
'
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
'
tis
either
well
paved
or
well
built
;
but
'
tis
in
the
heart
of
the
town
,
and
most
of
the
streets
,
especially
those
in
that
quarter
,
all
terminate
in
it
;
could
there
have
been
a
fountain
in
all
Calais
,
which
it
seems
there
can
not
,
as
such
an
object
would
have
been
a
great
ornament
,
it
is
not
to
be
doubted
,
but
that
the
inhabitants
would
have
had
it
in
the
very
centre
of
this
square
,
 
not
that
it
is
properly
a
square
,
 
because
'
tis
forty
feet
longer
from
east
to
west
,
than
from
north
to
south
;
so
that
the
French
in
general
have
more
reason
on
their
side
in
calling
them
Places
than
Squares
,
which
,
strictly
speaking
,
to
be
sure
,
they
are
not
.
  
<EOS>
The
town
-
house
seems
to
be
but
a
sorry
building
,
and
not
to
be
kept
in
the
best
repair
;
otherwise
it
had
been
a
second
great
ornament
to
this
place
;
it
answers
however
its
destination
,
and
serves
very
well
for
the
reception
of
the
magistrates
,
who
assemble
in
it
from
time
to
time
;
so
that
'
tis
presumable
,
justice
is
regularly
distributed
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
heard
much
of
it
,
but
there
is
nothing
at
all
curious
in
the
Courgain
;
'
tis
a
distinct
quarter
of
the
town
,
inhabited
solely
by
sailors
and
fishermen
;
it
consists
of
a
number
of
small
streets
,
neatly
built
and
mostly
of
brick
;
'
tis
extremely
populous
,
but
as
that
may
be
accounted
for
,
from
the
principles
of
their
diet
,
 
there
is
nothing
curious
in
that
neither
.
 
<EOS>
A
traveller
may
see
it
to
satisfy
himself
 
<EOS>
he
must
not
omit
however
taking
notice
of
La
Tour
de
Guet
,
upon
any
account
;
'
tis
so
called
from
its
particular
destination
,
because
in
war
it
serves
to
discover
and
give
notice
of
the
enemies
which
approach
the
place
,
either
by
sea
or
land
;
 
but
<EOS>
'
tis
monstrous
high
,
and
catches
the
eye
so
continually
,
you
can
not
avoid
taking
notice
of
it
if
you
would
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
singular
disappointment
to
me
,
that
I
could
not
have
permission
to
take
an
exact
survey
of
the
fortifications
,
which
are
the
strongest
in
the
world
,
and
which
,
from
first
to
last
,
that
is
,
for
the
time
they
were
set
about
by
Philip
of
France
,
Count
of
Bologne
,
to
the
present
war
,
wherein
many
reparations
were
made
,
have
cost
(
as
I
learned
afterwards
from
an
engineer
in
Gascony
)
 
above
a
hundred
millions
of
livres
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
very
remarkable
,
that
at
the
Tete
de
Gravelenes
,
and
where
the
town
is
naturally
the
weakest
,
they
have
expended
the
most
money
;
so
that
the
outworks
stretch
a
great
way
into
the
campaign
,
and
consequently
occupy
a
large
tract
of
ground
 
<EOS>
However
,
after
all
that
is
said
and
done
,
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
Calais
was
never
upon
any
account
so
considerable
from
itself
,
as
from
its
situation
,
and
that
easy
entrance
which
it
gave
our
ancestors
,
upon
all
occasions
,
into
France
:
it
was
not
without
its
inconveniences
also
;
being
no
less
troublesome
to
the
English
in
those
times
,
than
Dunkirk
has
been
to
us
,
in
ours
;
so
that
it
was
deservedly
looked
upon
as
the
key
to
both
kingdoms
,
which
no
doubt
is
the
reason
that
there
have
arisen
so
many
contentions
who
should
keep
it
:
 
of
these
,
the
siege
of
Calais
,
or
rather
the
blockade
(
for
it
was
shut
up
both
by
land
and
sea
)
,
was
the
most
memorable
,
as
it
with
-
stood
the
efforts
of
Edward
the
Third
a
whole
year
,
and
was
not
terminated
at
last
but
by
famine
and
extreme
misery
;
the
gallantry
of
Eustace
de
St.
Pierre
,
who
first
offered
himself
a
victim
for
his
fellow
-
citizens
,
has
rank'd
<EOS>
his
name
with
heroes
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
will
not
take
up
above
fifty
pages
,
it
would
be
injustice
to
the
reader
,
not
to
give
him
a
minute
account
of
that
romantic
transaction
,
as
well
as
of
the
siege
itself
,
in
Rapin
's
own
words
:
      
But
courage
!
<EOS>
gentle
reader
!
 
<EOS>
I
scorn
it
 
<EOS>
'
tis
enough
to
have
thee
in
my
power
 
but
to
make
use
of
the
advantage
which
the
fortune
of
the
pen
has
now
gained
over
thee
,
would
be
too
much
 
<EOS>
No
 
!
<EOS>
by
that
all
-
powerful
fire
which
warms
the
visionary
brain
,
and
lights
the
spirits
through
unworldly
tracts
!
<EOS>
ere
I
would
force
a
helpless
creature
upon
this
hard
service
,
and
make
thee
pay
,
poor
soul
!
<EOS>
for
fifty
pages
,
which
I
have
no
right
to
sell
thee
,
 
naked
as
I
am
,
I
would
browse
upon
the
mountains
,
and
smile
that
the
north
wind
brought
me
neither
my
tent
or
my
supper
.
    
<EOS>
So
put
on
,
my
brave
boy
!
<EOS>
and
make
the
best
of
thy
way
to
Boulogne

<EOS>
Boulogne

<EOS>
hah

<EOS>
so
we
are
all
got
together
 
debtors

sinners
before

a
jolly
set
of
us
 
<EOS>
but
I

quaff

off

<EOS>
When
the
precipitancy
of
a
man
's
wishes
hurries
on
his
ideas
ninety
times
faster
than
the
vehicle
he
rides
in
 
woe
be

truth

<EOS>
and
woe
be
to
the
vehicle
and
its
tackling
(
<EOS>
let
'em
be
made
of
what
stuff
you
will
)
upon
which
he
breathes
forth
the
disappointment
of
his
soul
!
  
<EOS>
As
I
never
give
general
characters
either
of
men
or
things
in
choler
,
"
the
most
haste
the
worse
speed
,
"
was
all
the
reflection
I
made
upon
the
affair
,
the
first
time
it
happen'd
;
 
the
second
,
third
,
fourth
,
and
fifth
time
,
I
confined
it
respectively
to
those
times
,
and
accordingly
blamed
only
the
second
,
third
,
fourth
,
and
fifth
post
-
boy
for
it
,
without
carrying
my
reflections
further
;
but
the
event
continuing
to
befal
me
from
the
fifth
,
to
the
sixth
,
seventh
,
eighth
,
ninth
,
and
tenth
time
,
and
without
one
exception
,
I
then
could
not
avoid
making
a
national
reflection
of
it
,
which
I
do
in
these
words
;
  
That
something
is
always
wrong
in
a
French
post
-
chaise
,
upon
first
setting
out
.
  
<EOS>
Or
the
proposition
may
stand
thus
:
  
<EOS>
A
French
postilion
has
always
to
alight
before
he
has
got
three
hundred
yards
out
of
town
.
  
<EOS>
What
's
wrong
now
?
 
<EOS>
Diable
!
 
<EOS>
a
rope
's
broke
!
 
<EOS>
a
knot
has
slipt
!
 
<EOS>
a
staple
's
drawn
!
 
<EOS>
a
bolt
's
to
whittle
!
 
<EOS>
a
tag
,
a
rag
,
a
jag
,
a
strap
,
a
buckle
,
or
a
buckle
's
tongue
,
want
altering
.
  
<EOS>
Now
true
as
all
this
is
,
I
never
think
myself
impowered
to
excommunicate
thereupon
either
the
post
-
chaise
,
or
its
driver
 
nor
do
I
take
it
into
my
head
to
swear
by
the
living
G
..
<EOS>
,
I
would
rather
go
a
-
foot
<EOS>
ten
thousand
times
 
or
that
I
will
be
damn'd
,
if
ever
I
get
into
another
 
<EOS>
but
I
take
the
matter
coolly
before
me
,
and
consider
,
that
some
tag
,
or
rag
,
or
jag
,
or
bolt
,
or
buckle
,
or
buckle
's
tongue
,
will
ever
be
a
wanting
or
want
altering
,
travel
where
I
will
 
<EOS>
so
I
never
chaff
,
but
take
the
good
and
the
bad
as
they
fall
in
my
road
,
and
get
on
:
 
<EOS>
Do
so
,
my
lad
!
<EOS>
said
I
<EOS>
;
he
had
lost
five
minutes
already
,
in
alighting
in
order
to
get
at
a
luncheon
of
black
bread
,
which
he
had
cramm'd
into
the
chaise
-
pocket
,
and
was
remounted
,
and
going
leisurely
on
,
to
relish
it
the
better
.
 
<EOS>
Get
on
,
my
lad
<EOS>
,
said
I
,
briskly
 
<EOS>
but
in
the
most
persuasive
tone
imaginable
,
for
I
jingled
a
four
-
and
-
twenty
sous
piece
against
the
glass
,
taking
care
to
hold
the
flat
side
towards
him
,
as
he
look'd
back
:
 
the
dog
grinn'd
intelligence
from
his
right
ear
to
his
left
,
and
behind
his
sooty
muzzle
discovered
such
a
pearly
row
of
teeth
,
that
Sovereignty
would
have
pawn'd
<EOS>
her
jewels
for
them
.
  
<EOS>
Just
heaven
!
 
<EOS>
What
masticators
!
 
<EOS>
/What
bread
!
    
<EOS>
and
so
as
he
finished
the
last
mouthful
of
it
,
we
entered
the
town
of
Montreuil
.
    
<EOS>
There
is
not
a
town
in
all
France
which
,
in
my
opinion
,
looks
better
in
the
map
,
than
Montreuil
;
 
I
own
,
it
does
not
look
so
well
in
the
book
of
post-
roads
;
but
when
you
come
to
see
it
 
to
be
sure
it
looks
most
pitifully
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
one
thing
,
however
,
in
it
at
present
very
handsome
;
and
that
is
,
the
inn
-
keeper
's
daughter
:
 
<EOS>
She
has
been
eighteen
months
at
Amiens
,
and
six
at
Paris
,
in
going
through
her
classes
;
so
knits
,
and
sews
,
and
dances
,
and
does
the
little
coquetries
very
well
.
      
<EOS>
A
slut
!
<EOS>
in
running
them
over
within
these
five
minutes
that
I
have
stood
looking
at
her
,
she
has
let
fall
at
least
a
dozen
loops
in
a
white
thread
<EOS>
stocking
 
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
 
I
see
,
you
cunning
gipsy
!
 
<EOS>
'
tis
long
and
taper
 
<EOS>
you
need
not
pin
it
to
your
knee
 
<EOS>
and
that
'
tis
your
own
 
and
fits
you
exactly
.
      
<EOS>
That
Nature
should
have
told
this
creature
a
word
about
a
statue
's
thumb
!
    
<EOS>
But
as
this
sample
is
worth
all
their
thumbs
 
<EOS>
besides
,
I
have
her
thumbs
and
fingers
in
at
the
bargain
,
if
they
can
be
any
guide
to
me
,
 
and
as
Janatone
withal
(
for
that
is
her
name
)
stands
so
well
for
a
drawing
 
<EOS>
may
I
never
draw
more
,
or
rather
may
I
draw
like
a
draught
-
horse
,
by
main
strength
all
the
days
of
my
life
,
 
if
I
do
not
draw
her
in
all
her
proportions
,
and
with
as
determined
a
pencil
,
as
if
I
had
her
in
the
wettest
drapery
.
      
<EOS>
But
your
worships
chuse
rather
that
I
give
you
the
length
,
breadth
,
and
perpendicular
height
of
the
great
parish
-
church
,
or
drawing
of
the
facade
of
the
abbey
of
Saint
Austreberte
which
has
been
transported
from
Artois
hither
 
<EOS>
every
thing
is
just
I
suppose
as
the
masons
and
carpenters
left
them
,
 
and
if
the
belief
in
Christ
continues
so
long
,
will
be
so
these
fifty
years
to
come
 
<EOS>
so
your
worships
and
reverences
may
all
measure
them
at
your
leisures
 
<EOS>
but
he
who
measures
thee
,
Janatone
,
must
do
it
now
 
<EOS>
thou
carriest
the
principles
of
change
within
thy
frame
;
and
considering
the
chances
of
a
transitory
life
,
I
would
not
answer
for
thee
a
moment
<EOS>
;
ere
twice
twelve
months
are
passed
and
gone
,
thou
mayest
grow
out
like
a
pumpkin
,
and
lose
thy
shapes
 
or
thou
mayest
go
off
like
a
flower
,
and
lose
thy
beauty
 
<EOS>
nay
,
thou
mayest
go
off
like
a
hussy
 
and
lose
thyself
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
answer
for
my
aunt
Dinah
,
was
she
alive
 
'
faith
,
<EOS>
scarce
for
her
picture
 
were
it
but
painted
by
Reynolds
    
<EOS>
But
if
I
go
on
with
my
drawing
,
after
naming
that
son
of
Apollo
,
I
'll
be
shot
    
<EOS>
So
you
must
e'en
be
content
with
the
original
;
<EOS>
which
,
if
the
evening
is
fine
in
passing
thro
'
Montreuil
,
you
will
see
at
your
chaise
-
door
,
as
you
change
horses
:
but
unless
you
have
as
bad
a
reason
for
haste
as
I
have
 
you
had
better
stop
:
 
<EOS>
She
has
a
little
of
the
devote
:
 
but
that
,
sir
,
is
a
terce
to
a
nine
in
your
favour
    
-L

<EOS>
help
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
count
a
single
point
:
 
so
had
been
piqued
and
repiqued
,
and
capotted
to
the
devil
.
    
<EOS>
All
which
being
considered
,
and
that
Death
moreover
might
be
much
nearer
me
than
I
imagined
 
I

I
was

What

is
travelling
!
<EOS>
only
it
heats
one
;
but
there
is
a
remedy
for
that
,
which
you
may
pick
out
of
the
next
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
Was
I
in
a
condition
to
stipulate
with
Death
,
<EOS>
as
I
am
this
moment
with
my
apothecary
,
how
and
where
I
will
take
his
clyster
 
<EOS>
I
should
certainly
declare
against
submitting
to
it
before
my
friends
;
and
therefore
I
never
seriously
think
upon
the
mode
and
manner
of
this
great
catastrophe
,
which
generally
takes
up
and
torments
my
thoughts
as
much
as
the
catastrophe
itself
;
but
I
constantly
draw
the
curtain
across
it
with
this
wish
,
that
the
Disposer
of
all
things
may
so
order
it
,
that
it
happen
not
to
me
in
my
own
house
 
but
rather
in
some
decent
inn
 
at
home
<EOS>
,
I
know
it
,
 
<EOS>
the
concern
of
my
friends
,
and
the
last
services
of
wiping
my
brows
,
and
smoothing
my
pillow
,
which
the
quivering
hand
of
pale
affection
shall
pay
me
,
will
so
crucify
my
soul
,
that
I
shall
die
of
a
distemper
which
my
physician
is
not
aware
of
:
 
but
in
an
inn
,
the
few
cold
offices
I
wanted
,
would
be
purchased
with
a
few
guineas
,
and
paid
me
with
an
undisturbed
,
but
punctual
attention
 
but
mark
.
 
<EOS>
This
inn
should
not
be
the
inn
at
Abbeville
 
if
there
was
not
another
inn
in
the
universe
,
I
would
strike
that
inn
out
of
the
capitulation
:
so
  
Let
the
horses
be
in
the
chaise
exactly
by
four
in
the
morning
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
by
four
,
Sir
,
 
or
by
Genevieve
!
<EOS>
I
'll
raise
a
clatter
in
the
house
<EOS>
shall
wake
the
dead
.
    
<EOS>
"
Make
them
like
unto
a
wheel
,
"
is
a
bitter
sarcasm
,
as
all
the
learned
know
,
against
the
grand
tour
,
and
that
restless
spirit
for
making
it
,
which
David
prophetically
foresaw
would
haunt
the
children
of
men
in
the
latter
days
;
and
therefore
,
as
thinketh
the
great
bishop
Hall
,
'
tis
one
of
the
severest
imprecations
<EOS>
which
David
ever
utter'd
against
the
enemies
of
the
Lord
 
and
,
as
if
he
had
said
,
"
I
wish
them
no
worse
luck
than
always
to
be
rolling
about
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
much
motion
,
continues
he
(
for
he
was
very
corpulent
)
  
<EOS>
is
so
much
unquietness
;
and
so
much
of
rest
,
by
the
same
analogy
,
is
so
much
of
heaven
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
I
(
being
very
thin
)
think
differently
;
and
that
so
much
of
motion
,
is
so
much
of
life
,
and
so
much
of
joy
 
and
that
to
stand
still
,
or
get
on
but
slowly
,
is
death
and
the
devil
    
Hollo
!
 
<EOS>
Ho
!
 
<EOS>
the
whole
world
's
asleep
!
 
<EOS>
bring
out
the
horses
 
<EOS>
grease
<EOS>
the
wheels
 
tie
on
the
mail
 
and
drive
a
nail
into
that
moulding
 
<EOS>
I
'll
not
lose
a
moment
    
<EOS>
Now
the
wheel
we
are
talking
of
,
and
whereinto
(
but
not
whereonto
,
for
that
would
make
an
Ixion
's
wheel
of
it
)
<EOS>
he
curseth
his
enemies
,
according
to
the
bishop
's
habit
of
body
,
should
certainly
be
a
post
-
chaise
wheel
,
whether
they
were
set
up
in
Palestine
at
that
time
or
not
 
and
my
wheel
,
for
the
contrary
reasons
,
must
as
certainly
be
a
cart
-
wheel
groaning
<EOS>
round
its
revolution
once
in
an
age
;
and
of
which
sort
,
were
I
to
turn
commentator
<EOS>
,
I
should
make
no
scruple
to
affirm
,
they
had
great
store
in
that
hilly
country
.
  
<EOS>
I
love
the
Pythagoreans
(
much
more
than
ever
<EOS>
I
dare
tell
my
dear
Jenny
)
for
their
"
(
Greek

"
 
<EOS>
(
their
)
"
getting
out
of
the
body
,
in
order
to
think
well
.
"
 
<EOS>
No
man
thinks
right
,
whilst
he
is
in
it
;
blinded
as
he
must
be
,
with
his
congenial
humours
,
and
drawn
differently
aside
,
as
the
bishop
and
myself
have
been
,
with
too
lax
or
too
tense
a
fibre
 
<EOS>
Reason
is
,
half
of
it
,
Sense
;
and
the
measure
of
heaven
itself
is
but
the
measure
of
our
present
appetites
and
concoctions
.
      
<EOS>
But
which
of
the
two
,
in
the
present
case
,
do
you
think
to
be
mostly
in
the
wrong
?
  
<EOS>
You
,
certainly
:
 
quoth
<EOS>
she
,
to
disturb
a
whole
family
so
early
.
      
<EOS>
But
she
did
not
know
I
was
under
a
vow
not
to
shave
my
beard
till
I
got
to
Paris
;
 
yet
<EOS>
I
hate
to
make
mysteries
of
nothing
;
 
'
tis
the
cold
cautiousness
of
one
of
those
little
souls
from
which
Lessius
(
lib
.
<EOS>
13
.
<EOS>
de
moribus
divinis
,
cap
.
<EOS>
24
.
)
<EOS>
hath
made
his
estimate
,
wherein
he
setteth
forth
,
That
one
Dutch
mile
,
cubically
multiplied
,
will
allow
room
enough
,
and
to
spare
,
for
eight
hundred
thousand
millions
,
which
he
supposes
to
be
as
great
a
number
of
souls
(
counting
from
the
fall
of
Adam
)
as
can
possibly
be
damn'd
to
the
end
of
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
From
what
he
has
made
this
second
estimate
 
unless
from
the
parental
goodness
of
God
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
 
<EOS>
I
am
much
more
at
a
loss
what
could
be
in
Franciscus
Ribbera
's
head
,
who
pretends
that
no
less
a
space
than
one
of
two
hundred
Italian
miles
multiplied
into
itself
,
will
be
sufficient
to
hold
the
like
number
 
<EOS>
he
certainly
must
have
gone
upon
some
of
the
old
Roman
souls
,
of
which
he
had
read
,
without
reflecting
how
much
,
by
a
gradual
and
most
tabid
decline
,
in
the
course
of
eighteen
hundred
years
,
they
must
unavoidably
have
shrunk
so
as
to
have
come
,
when
he
wrote
,
almost
to
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
In
Lessius
's
time
,
who
seems
the
cooler
man
,
they
were
as
little
as
can
be
imagined
      
<EOS>
We
find
them
less
now
    
<EOS>
And
next
winter
we
shall
find
them
less
again
;
so
that
if
we
go
on
from
little
to
less
,
and
from
less
to
nothing
,
I
hesitate
not
one
moment
to
affirm
,
that
in
half
a
century
at
this
rate
,
we
shall
have
no
souls
at
all
;
which
being
the
period
beyond
which
I
doubt
likewise
of
the
existence
of
the
Christian
faith
,
'
twill
be
one
advantage
that
both
of
'em
will
be
exactly
worn
out
together
.
  
<EOS>
Blessed
Jupiter
!
<EOS>
and
blessed
every
other
heathen
god
and
goddess
!
<EOS>
for
now
ye
will
all
come
into
play
again
,
and
with
Priapus
at
your
tails
 
<EOS>
what
jovial
times
!
 
<EOS>
but
where
am
I
?
<EOS>
and
into
what
a
delicious
riot
of
things
am
I
rushing
?
 
<EOS>
I
 
<EOS>
I
who
must
be
cut
short
in
the
midst
of
my
days
,
and
taste
no
more
of
'em
than
what
I
borrow
from
my
imagination
 
peace
to
thee
,
generous
fool
!
<EOS>
and
let
me
go
on
.
      
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
hating
,
I
say
,
to
make
mysteries
of
nothing
"
 
<EOS>
I
intrusted
it
with
the
post
-
boy
,
as
soon
as
ever
I
got
off
the
stones
;
he
gave
a
crack
with
his
whip
to
balance
the
compliment
;
and
with
the
thill
-
horse
trotting
,
and
a
sort
of
an
up
and
a
down
of
the
other
,
we
danced
it
along
to
<EOS>
Ailly
au
clochers
,
famed
in
days
of
yore
for
the
finest
chimes
in
the
world
;
but
we
danced
through
it
without
music
 
the
chimes
being
greatly
out
of
order
 
<EOS>
(
as
in
truth
they
were
through
all
France
)
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
making
all
possible
speed
,
from
  
Ailly
au
clochers
,
I
got
to
Hixcourt
,
<EOS>
from
Hixcourt
I
got
to
Pequignay
,
and
from
Pequignay
,
I
got
to
Amiens
,
concerning
which
town
I
have
nothing
to
inform
you
,
but
what
I
have
informed
you
once
before
 
and
that
was
 
that
Janatone
went
there
to
school
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
whole
catalogue
of
those
whiffling
vexations
which
come
puffing
across
a
man
's
canvass
,
there
is
not
one
of
a
more
teasing
and
tormenting
nature
,
than
this
particular
one
which
I
am
going
to
describe
 
and
for
which
(
unless
you
travel
with
an
avance
-
courier
,
which
numbers
do
in
order
to
prevent
it
)
 
there
is
no
help
:
 
and
it
is
this

<EOS>
That
be

never

kindly
a

sleep

you
are

perhaps
through
the
finest
country
 
upon
the
best
roads
,
and
in
the
easiest
carriage
for
doing
it
in
the
world
 
nay
,
was
you
sure
you
could
sleep
fifty
miles
straight
forwards
,
without
once
opening
your
eyes
 
<EOS>
nay
,
what
is
more
,
was
you
as
demonstratively
satisfied
as
you
can
be
of
any
truth
in
Euclid
,
that
you
should
upon
all
accounts
be
full
as
well
asleep
as
awake
 
nay
,
perhaps
better
 
<EOS>
Yet
the
incessant
returns
of
paying
for
the
horses
at
every
stage
,
 
with
the
necessity
thereupon
of
putting
your
hand
into
your
pocket
,
and
counting
out
from
thence
three
livres
fifteen
sous
(
sous
by
sous
)
,
puts
an
end
to
so
much
of
the
project
,
that
you
can
not
execute
above
six
miles
of
it
(
or
supposing
it
is
a
post
and
a
half
,
that
is
but
nine
)
 
were
it
to
save
your
soul
from
destruction
.
    
<EOS>
I
'll
be
even
with
'em
,
quoth
<EOS>
I
,
for
I
'll
put
the
precise
sum
into
a
piece
of
paper
,
and
hold
it
ready
in
my
hand
all
the
way
:
 
<EOS>
"
Now
I
shall
have
nothing
to
do
,
"
said
I
(
composing
myself
to
rest
)
,
"
but
to
drop
this
gently
into
the
post
-
boy
's
hat
,
and
not
say
a
word
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Then
there
wants
two
sous
more
to
drink
 
or
there
is
a
twelve
sous
piece
of
Louis
XIV
.
<EOS>
which
will
not
pass
 
or
a
livre
and
some
odd
liards
to
be
brought
over
from
the
last
stage
,
which
Monsieur
had
forgot
;
which
altercations
(
as
a
man
can
not
dispute
very
well
asleep
)
<EOS>
rouse
him
:
 
still
is
sweet
sleep
retrievable
;
and
still
might
the
flesh
weigh
down
the
spirit
,
and
recover
itself
of
these
blows
 
but
then
,
by
heaven
!
<EOS>
you
have
paid
but
for
a
single
post
 
<EOS>
whereas
'
tis
a
post
and
a
half
;
and
this
obliges
you
to
pull
out
your
book
of
post-
roads
,
the
print
of
which
is
so
very
small
,
it
forces
you
to
open
your
eyes
,
whether
you
will
or
no
:
 
<EOS>
Then
Monsieur
le
Cure
offers
you
a
pinch
of
snuff
 
or
<EOS>
a
poor
soldier
shews
you
<EOS>
his
leg
 
or
a
shaveling
his
box
 
or
the
priestesse
of
the
cistern
will
water
your
wheels
 
<EOS>
they
do
not
want
it
 
<EOS>
but
she
swears
by
her
priesthood
(
throwing
it
back
)
that
they
do
:
 
<EOS>
then
you
have
all
these
points
to
argue
,
or
consider
over
in
your
mind
;
in
doing
of
which
,
the
rational
powers
get
so
thoroughly
awakened
 
<EOS>
you
may
get
'em
to
sleep
again
as
you
can
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
entirely
owing
to
one
of
these
misfortunes
,
or
I
had
pass'd
clean
by
the
stables
of
Chantilly
      
<EOS>
But
the
postillion
first
affirming
,
and
then
persisting
in
it
to
my
face
,
that
there
was
no
mark
upon
the
two
sous
piece
<EOS>
,
I
open'd
<EOS>
my
eyes
to
be
convinced
  
and
seeing
the
mark
upon
it
as
plain
as
my
nose
 
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
leap'd
out
of
the
chaise
in
a
passion
,
and
so
saw
every
thing
at
Chantilly
in
spite
.
  
<EOS>
I
tried
it
<EOS>
but
for
three
posts
and
a
half
,
but
believe
'
tis
the
best
principle
in
the
world
to
travel
speedily
upon
;
for
as
few
objects
look
very
inviting
in
that
mood
 
<EOS>
you
have
little
or
nothing
to
stop
you
;
by
which
means
it
was
that
I
passed
through
St.
Dennis
,
without
turning
my
head
so
much
as
on
one
side
towards
the
Abby
      
Richness
of
their
treasury
!
<EOS>
stuff
and
nonsense
!
 
<EOS>
bating
their
jewels
,
which
are
all
false
,
I
would
not
give
three
sous
for
any
one
thing
in
it
,
but
Jaidas
's
lantern
 
nor
for
that
either
,
only
as
it
grows
dark
,
it
might
be
of
use
.
    
<EOS>
Crack

crack
 
crack

<EOS>
so
this

I

<EOS>

The

better

the
good

to
be
informed

that
a
man
with
pale
face

clad
in

had
the
honour
to
be
driven
into
Paris
at
nine
o'clock
at
night

by
a
postillion

a
tawny
yellow

turned
up

I
wish

crack
on

<EOS>
Ha

<EOS>
and
no

What

Ho

Tis
too
much

<EOS>
Now
I
can
not
bear
the
barbarity
of
it
;
how
can
that
unconscionable
coachman
talk
so
much
bawdy
to
that
lean
horse
?
<EOS>
do
n't
you
see
,
friend
,
the
streets
are
so
villanously
narrow
,
that
there
is
not
room
in
all
Paris
to
turn
a
wheelbarrow
?
 
<EOS>
In
the
grandest
city
of
the
whole
world
,
it
would
not
have
been
amiss
,
if
they
had
been
left
a
thought
wider
;
nay
,
were
it
only
so
much
in
every
single
street
,
as
that
a
man
might
know
(
was
it

satisfaction

on

and
twice
the

<EOS>
and
all
within
three
minutes
driving

<EOS>
one
would
think
that
all
the
cooks
in
the
world
,
on
some
great
merry
-
meeting
with
the
barbers
,
by
joint
consent
had
said
 
Come
,
let
us
all
go
live
at
Paris
:
 
<EOS>
the
French
love
good
eating
 
<EOS>
they
are
all
gourmands
 
<EOS>
we
shall
rank
high
;
if
their
god
is
their
belly
 
their
cooks
must
be
gentlemen
:
 
and
forasmuch
as
the
periwig
maketh
the
man
,
and
the
periwig-
maker
maketh
the
periwig
 
<EOS>
ergo
,
would
the
barbers
say
,
we
shall
rank
higher
still
 
<EOS>
we
shall
be
above
you
all
 
<EOS>
we
shall
be
Capitouls
(
Chief
Magistrate
in
Toulouse
,
&
c.
&
c.
&
c.
)
<EOS>
at
least
 
pardi
!
<EOS>
we
shall
all
wear
swords
      
<EOS>
And
so
,
one
would
swear
,
(
that
is
,
by
candle
-
light
,
 
but
<EOS>
there
is
no
depending
upon
it
,
)
<EOS>
they
continued
to
do
,
to
this
day
.
    
<EOS>
The
French
are
certainly
misunderstood
:
 
but
whether
the
fault
is
theirs
,
in
not
sufficiently
explaining
themselves
;
or
speaking
with
that
exact
limitation
and
precision
which
one
would
expect
on
a
point
of
such
importance
,
and
which
,
moreover
,
is
so
likely
to
be
contested
by
us
 
or
whether
the
fault
may
not
be
altogether
on
our
side
,
in
not
understanding
their
language
always
so
critically
as
to
know
"
what
they
would
be
at
"
 
<EOS>
I
shall
not
decide
;
but
'
tis
evident
to
me
,
when
they
affirm
,
"
That
they
who
have
seen
Paris
,
have
seen
every
thing
,
"
they
must
mean
to
speak
of
those
who
have
seen
it
by
day
-
light
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
candle
-
light
 
<EOS>
I
give
it
up
 
<EOS>
I
have
said
before
,
there
was
no
depending
upon
it
 
<EOS>
and
I
repeat
it
again
;
but
not
because
the
lights
and
shades
are
too
sharp
 
or
the
tints
confounded
 
or
that
there
is
neither
beauty
or
keeping
,
&
c
..
.
<EOS>
.for
<EOS>
that
's
not
truth
 
<EOS>
but
it
is
an
uncertain
light
in
this
respect
,
That
in
all
the
five
hundred
grand
Hotels
,
which
they
number
up
to
you
in
Paris
 
and
the
five
hundred
good
things
,
at
a
modest
computation
(
for
'
tis
<EOS>
only
allowing
one
good
thing
to
a
Hotel
)
,
which
by
candle
-
light
are
best
to
be
seen
,
felt
,
heard
,
and
understood
(
which
,
by
the
bye
,
is
a
quotation
from
Lilly
)
 
<EOS>
the
devil
a
one
of
us
out
of
fifty
,
can
get
our
heads
fairly
thrust
in
amongst
them

<EOS>
This
is
no
part
of
the
French
computation

simply
this

That
by

taken
in
the
year
one
thousand
seven
hundred

since

The
French
have
a
gay
way
of
treating
every
thing
that
is
Great
;
and
that
is
all
can
be
said
upon
it
.
    
<EOS>
In
mentioning
the
word
gay
(
as
in
the
close
of
the
last
chapter
)
it
puts
one
(
i.e.
an
author
)
in
mind
of
the
word
spleen
 
especially
if
he
has
any
thing
to
say
upon
it
:
 
not
that
by
any
analysis
 
or
that
from
any
table
of
interest
or
genealogy
,
there
appears
much
more
ground
of
alliance
betwixt
them
,
than
betwixt
light
and
darkness
,
or
any
two
of
the
most
unfriendly
opposites
in
nature
 
<EOS>
only
'
tis
an
undercraft
of
authors
to
keep
up
a
good
understanding
amongst
words
,
as
politicians
do
amongst
men
 
not
knowing
how
near
they
may
be
under
a
necessity
of
placing
them
to
each
other
 
which
point
being
now
gain'd
,
and
that
I
may
place
mine
exactly
to
my
mind
,
I
write
it
down
here
    
Spleen
.
  
<EOS>
This
,
upon
leaving
Chantilly
,
I
declared
to
be
the
best
principle
in
the
world
to
travel
speedily
upon
;
but
I
gave
it
only
as
matter
of
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
I
still
continue
in
the
same
sentiments
 
only
I
had
not
then
experience
enough
of
its
working
to
add
this
,
that
though
you
do
get
on
at
a
tearing
rate
,
yet
you
get
on
but
uneasily
to
yourself
at
the
same
time
;
for
which
reason
I
here
quit
it
entirely
,
and
for
ever
,
and
'
tis
heartily
at
any
one
's
service
 
<EOS>
it
has
spoiled
me
the
digestion
of
a
good
supper
,
and
brought
on
a
bilious
diarrhoea
,
which
has
brought
me
back
again
to
my
first
principle
on
which
I
set
out
 
and
with
which
I
shall
now
scamper
it
away
to
the
banks
of
the
Garonne
      
No
;
 
I
can
not
stop
a
moment
to
give
you
the
character
of
the
people
  
their
genius
 
their
manners
 
their
customs
 
<EOS>
their
laws
 
their
religion
  
<EOS>
their
government
 
their
manufactures
 
their
commerce
 
<EOS>
their
finances
,
with
all
the
resources
and
hidden
springs
which
sustain
them
:
qualified
as
I
may
be
,
by
spending
three
days
and
two
nights
amongst
them
,
and
during
all
that
time
making
these
things
<EOS>
the
entire
subject
of
my
enquiries
and
reflections
    
<EOS>
Still
 
still
I
must
away

roads
are
paved

A
Dedication
to
a
Great
Man
.
  
<EOS>
Having
,
a
priori
,
intended
to
dedicate
The
Amours
of
my
Uncle
Toby
to
Mr.
...
 
<EOS>
I
see
more
reasons
,
a
posteriori
,
for
doing
it
to
Lord
........
  
<EOS>
I
should
lament
from
my
soul
,
if
this
exposed
me
to
the
jealousy
of
their
Reverences
;
because
a
posteriori
,
in
Court
-
latin
,
signifies
the
kissing
hands
for
preferment
 
or
any
thing
else
 
in
order
to
get
it
.
  
<EOS>
My
opinion
of
Lord
.......
is
neither
better
nor
worse
,
than
it
was
of
Mr.
....
 
<EOS>
Honours
,
like
impressions
upon
coin
,
may
give
an
ideal
and
local
value
to
a
bit
of
base
metal
;
but
Gold
and
Silver
will
pass
all
the
world
over
without
any
other
recommendation
than
their
own
weight
.
  
<EOS>
The
same
good
-
will
that
made
me
think
of
offering
up
half
an
hour
's
amusement
to
Mr.
...
<EOS>
when
out
of
place
 
operates
more
forcibly
at
present
,
as
half
an
hour
's
amusement
will
be
more
serviceable
and
refreshing
after
labour
and
sorrow
,
than
after
a
philosophical
repast
.
  
<EOS>
Nothing
is
so
perfectly
amusement
as
a
total
change
of
ideas
;
no
ideas
are
so
totally
different
as
those
of
Ministers
,
and
innocent
Lovers
:
 
for
which
reason
,
when
I
come
to
talk
of
Statesmen
and
Patriots
,
and
set
such
marks
upon
them
as
will
prevent
confusion
and
mistakes
concerning
them
for
the
future
 
I
propose
to
dedicate
that
Volume
to
some
gentle
Shepherd
,
  
<EOS>
Whose
thoughts
proud
Science
never
taught
to
stray
,
Far
as
the
Statesman
's
walk
or
Patriot
-
way
;
Yet
simple
Nature
to
his
hopes
had
given
Out
of
a
cloud
-
capp'd
head
a
humbler
heaven
;
Some
untam'd
World
in
depths
of
wood
embraced
  
<EOS>
Some
happier
Island
in
the
wat'ry
-
waste
  
<EOS>
And
where
admitted
to
that
equal
sky
,
His
faithful
Dogs
should
bear
him
company
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
by
thus
introducing
an
entire
new
set
of
objects
to
his
Imagination
,
I
shall
unavoidably
give
a
Diversion
to
his
passionate
and
love
-
sick
Contemplations
.

Now
I
hate
to
hear
a
person
,
especially
if
he
be
a
traveller
,
complain
that
we
do
not
get
on
so
fast
in
France
as
we
do
in
England
;
whereas
we
get
on
much
faster
,
consideratis
considerandis
;
thereby
always
meaning
,
that
if
you
weigh
their
vehicles
with
the
mountains
of
baggage
which
you
lay
both
before
and
behind
upon
them
 
and
then
consider
their
puny
horses
,
with
the
very
little
they
give
them
 
'
tis
a
wonder
they
get
on
at
all
:
 
<EOS>
their
suffering
is
most
unchristian
,
and
'
tis
evident
thereupon
to
me
,
that
a
French
post
-
horse
would
not
know
what
in
the
world
to
do
,
was
it
not
for
the
two
words
......
<EOS>
and
......
in
which
there
is
as
much
sustenance
,
as
if
you
give
him
a
peck
of
corn
:
 
now
as
these
words
cost
nothing
,
<EOS>
I
long
from
my
soul
to
tell
the
reader
what
they
are
;
but
here
is
the
question
 
they
must
be
told
him
plainly
,
and
with
the
most
distinct
articulation
,
or
it
will
answer
no
end
 
and
yet
to
do
it
in
that
plain
way
 
though
their
reverences
may
laugh
at
it
in
the
bed
-
chamber
 
full
<EOS>
well
I
wot
,
they
will
abuse
it
in
the
parlour
:
 
for
which
cause
,
I
have
been
volving
and
revolving
in
my
fancy
some
time
,
but
to
no
purpose
,
by
what
clean
device
or
facette
contrivance
I
might
so
modulate
them
,
that
whilst
I
satisfy
that
ear
which
the
reader
chuses
to
lend
me
 
<EOS>
I
might
not
dissatisfy
the
other
which
he
keeps
to
himself
.
    
<EOS>
My
ink
burns
my
finger
to
try
 
<EOS>
and
when
I
have
 
'
twill
have
a
worse
consequence
 
<EOS>
It
will
burn
(
I
fear
)
my
paper
.
    
<EOS>
No
;
 
<EOS>
I
dare
not
    
<EOS>
But
if
you
wish
to
know
how
the
abbess
of
Andouillets
and
a
novice
of
her
convent
got
over
the
difficulty
(
only
first
wishing
myself
all
imaginable
success
)
 
I
'll
tell
you
without
the
least
scruple
.
    
<EOS>
The
abbess
of
Andouillets
,
which
if
you
look
into
the
large
set
of
provincial
maps
now
publishing
at
Paris
,
you
will
find
situated
amongst
the
hills
which
divide
Burgundy
from
Savoy
,
being
in
danger
of
an
Anchylosis
or
stiff
joint
(
the
sinovia
of
her
knee
becoming
hard
by
long
matins
)
,
and
having
tried
every
remedy
 
first
,
prayers
and
thanksgiving
;
then
invocations
to
all
the
saints
in
heaven
<EOS>
promiscuously
 
then
particularly
to
every
saint
who
had
ever
had
a
stiff
leg
before
her
 
then
touching
it
with
all
the
reliques
of
the
convent
,
principally
with
the
thigh
-
bone
of
the
man
of
Lystra
,
who
had
been
impotent
from
his
youth
 
then
wrapping
it
up
in
her
veil
when
she
went
to
bed
 
then
cross
-
wise
<EOS>
her
rosary
 
<EOS>
then
bringing
in
to
her
aid
the
secular
arm
,
and
anointing
it
with
oils
and
hot
fat
of
animals
 
then
treating
it
with
emollient
and
resolving
fomentations
 
then
with
poultices
of
marsh
-
mallows
,
mallows
,
bonus
Henricus
,
white
lillies
and
fenugreek
 
then
taking
the
woods
,
I
mean
the
smoak
of
'em
,
holding
her
scapulary
across
her
lap
 
then
decoctions
of
wild
chicory
,
water
-
cresses
,
chervil
,
sweet
cecily
and
cochlearia
 
and
nothing
all
this
while
answering
,
was
prevailed
on
at
last
to
try
the
hot
-
baths
of
Bourbon
 
so
having
first
obtained
leave
of
the
visitor
-
general
to
take
care
of
her
existence
 
<EOS>
she
ordered
all
to
be
got
ready
for
her
journey
:
 
a
novice
of
the
convent
of
about
seventeen
,
who
had
been
troubled
with
a
whitloe
in
her
middle
finger
,
by
sticking
it
constantly
into
the
abbess
's
cast
poultices
,
&
c.
 
had
gained
such
an
interest
,
that
overlooking
a
sciatical
old
nun
,
who
might
have
been
set
up
for
ever
by
the
hot
-
baths
of
Bourbon
,
Margarita
,
the
little
novice
,
was
elected
as
the
companion
of
the
journey
.
  
<EOS>
An
old
calesh
,
belonging
to
the
abbesse
,
lined
with
green
frize
,
was
ordered
to
be
drawn
out
into
the
sun
 
<EOS>
the
gardener
of
the
convent
being
chosen
muleteer
,
led
out
the
two
old
mules
,
to
clip
the
hair
from
the
rump-
ends
of
their
tails
,
whilst
a
couple
of
lay
-
sisters
were
busied
,
the
one
in
darning
the
lining
,
and
the
other
in
sewing
on
the
shreds
of
yellow
binding
,
which
the
teeth
of
time
had
unravelled
 
the
under
-
gardener
dress'd
<EOS>
the
muleteer
's
hat
in
hot
wine
-
lees
 
and
a
taylor
sat
musically
at
it
,
in
a
shed
over
-
against
the
convent
,
in
assorting
four
dozen
of
bells
for
the
harness
,
whistling
to
each
bell
,
as
he
tied
it
on
with
a
thong
.
      
<EOS>
The
carpenter
and
the
smith
of
Andouillets
held
a
council
of
wheels
;
and
by
seven
,
the
morning
after
,
all
look'd
spruce
,
and
was
ready
at
the
gate
of
the
convent
for
the
hot
-
baths
of
Bourbon
 
two
rows
of
the
unfortunate
stood
ready
there
an
hour
before
.
  
<EOS>
The
abbess
of
Andouillets
,
supported
by
Margarita
the
novice
,
advanced
slowly
to
the
calesh
,
both
clad
in
white
,
with
their
black
rosaries
hanging
at
their
breasts
      
<EOS>
There
was
a
simple
solemnity
in
the
contrast
:
 
<EOS>
they
entered
the
calesh
;
the
nuns
in
the
same
uniform
,
sweet
emblem
of
innocence
,
each
occupied
a
window
,
and
as
the
abbess
and
Margarita
<EOS>
look'd
<EOS>
up
 
each
<EOS>
(
the
sciatical
poor
nun
excepted
)
 
<EOS>
each
stream'd
<EOS>
out
the
end
of
her
veil
in
the
air
 
then
kiss'd
the
lilly
hand
which
let
it
go
:
 
the
good
abbess
and
Margarita
laid
their
hands
saint
-
wise
upon
their
breasts
 
<EOS>
look'd
up
to
heaven
 
then
to
them
 
and
<EOS>
look'd
"
God
bless
you
,
dear
sisters
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
declare
I
am
interested
in
this
story
,
and
wish
I
had
been
there
.
  
<EOS>
The
gardener
,
whom
I
shall
now
call
the
muleteer
,
was
a
little
,
hearty
,
broad
-
set
,
good
-
natured
,
chattering
,
toping
kind
of
a
fellow
,
who
troubled
his
head
very
little
with
the
how
s
and
when
s
of
life
;
so
had
mortgaged
a
month
of
his
conventical
wages
in
a
borrachio
,
or
leathern
cask
of
wine
,
which
he
had
disposed
behind
the
calesh
,
with
a
large
russet
-
coloured
riding
-
coat
over
it
,
to
guard
it
from
the
sun
;
and
as
the
weather
was
hot
,
and
he
not
a
niggard
of
his
labours
,
walking
ten
times
more
than
he
rode
  
<EOS>
he
found
more
occasions
than
those
of
nature
,
to
fall
back
to
the
rear
of
his
carriage
;
till
by
frequent
coming
and
going
,
it
had
so
happen'd
,
that
all
his
wine
had
leak'd
out
at
the
legal
vent
of
the
borrachio
,
before
one
half
of
the
journey
was
finish'd
.
  
<EOS>
Man
is
a
creature
born
to
habitudes
.
 
<EOS>
The
day
had
been
sultry
 
<EOS>
the
evening
was
delicious
 
<EOS>
the
wine
was
generous
 
<EOS>
the
Burgundian
hill
on
which
it
grew
was
steep
 
a
little
tempting
bush
over
the
door
of
a
cool
cottage
at
the
foot
of
it
,
hung
vibrating
in
full
harmony
with
the
passions
 
a
gentle
air
rustled
distinctly
through
the
leaves
 
<EOS>
"
Come
 
come
,
thirsty
muleteer
,
 
come
in
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
muleteer
was
a
son
of
Adam
,
I
need
not
say
a
word
more
.
 
<EOS>
He
gave
the
mules
,
each
of
'em
,
a
sound
lash
,
and
looking
in
the
abbess
's
and
<EOS>
Margarita
's
faces
(
as
he
did
it
)
 
as
much
as
to
say
"
here
I
am
"
 
<EOS>
he
gave
a
second
good
crack
 
as
much
as
to
say
to
his
mules
,
"
get
on
"
 
so
slinking
behind
,
<EOS>
he
enter'd
<EOS>
the
little
inn
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
.
  
<EOS>
The
muleteer
,
as
I
told
you
,
was
a
little
,
joyous
,
chirping
fellow
,
who
thought
not
of
to
-
morrow
,
nor
of
what
had
gone
before
,
or
what
was
to
follow
it
,
provided
he
got
<EOS>
but
his
scantling
of
Burgundy
,
and
a
little
chit
-
chat
along
with
it
;
so
entering
into
a
long
conversation
,
as
how
he
was
chief
gardener
to
the
convent
of
Andouillets
,
&
c.
&
c.
and
out
of
friendship
for
the
abbess
and
Mademoiselle
Margarita
,
who
was
only
in
her
noviciate
,
he
had
come
along
with
them
from
the
confines
of
Savoy
,
&
c.
&
c.
 
and
as
how
she
had
got
a
white
swelling
by
her
devotions
 
and
what
a
nation
of
herbs
he
had
procured
to
mollify
her
humours
,
&
c.
&
c.
and
that
if
the
waters
of
Bourbon
did
not
mend
that
leg
 
<EOS>
she
might
as
well
be
lame
of
both
 
&
c.
&
c.
&
c.
 
<EOS>
He
so
contrived
his
story
,
as
absolutely
to
forget
the
heroine
of
it
 
and
with
her
the
little
novice
,
and
what
was
a
more
ticklish
point
to
be
forgot
than
both
 
the
two
mules
;
who
being
creatures
that
take
advantage
of
the
world
,
inasmuch
as
their
parents
took
it
of
them
 
<EOS>
and
they
not
being
in
a
condition
to
return
the
obligation
downwards
(
<EOS>
as
men
and
women
and
beasts
are
)
 
<EOS>
they
do
it
side
-
ways
,
and
long
-
ways
,
and
back
-
ways
  
and
up
hill
,
and
down
hill
,
and
which
way
they
can
.
 
<EOS>
Philosophers
,
with
all
their
ethicks
,
have
never
considered
this
rightly
 
how
should
the
poor
muleteer
,
then
in
his
cups
,
consider
it
at
all
?
<EOS>
he
did
not
in
the
least
  
'
tis
time
we
do
;
let
us
leave
him
then
in
the
vortex
of
his
element
,
the
happiest
and
most
thoughtless
of
mortal
men
 
and
for
a
moment
let
us
look
after
the
mules
,
the
abbess
,
and
Margarita
.
  
<EOS>
By
virtue
of
the
muleteer
's
two
last
strokes
the
mules
had
gone
quietly
on
,
following
their
own
consciences
up
the
hill
,
till
they
had
conquer'd
<EOS>
about
one
half
of
it
;
when
the
elder
of
them
,
a
shrewd
crafty
old
devil
,
at
the
turn
of
an
angle
,
giving
a
side
glance
,
and
no
muleteer
behind
them
,
    
By
my
fig
!
<EOS>
said
she
,
swearing
<EOS>
,
I
'll
go
no
further
 
<EOS>
And
if
I
do
,
replied
the
other
,
they
shall
make
a
drum
of
my
hide
.
    
<EOS>
And
so
with
one
consent
they
stopp'd
<EOS>
thus
        
Get

said
Margarita
,
as

as

<EOS>
Sancta
Maria
!
<EOS>
cried
the
abbess
(
forgetting
the
O
!
)
 
<EOS>
why
was
I
govern'd
by
this
wicked
stiff
joint
?
<EOS>
why
did
I
leave
the
convent
of
Andouillets
?
<EOS>
and
why
didst
thou
not
suffer
thy
servant
to
go
unpolluted
to
her
tomb
?
  
<EOS>
O
my
finger
!
<EOS>
my
finger
!
<EOS>
cried
the
novice
,
catching
fire
at
the
word
servant
 
<EOS>
why
was
I
not
content
to
put
it
here
,
or
there
,
any
where
rather
than
be
in
this
strait
?
  
<EOS>
Strait
!
<EOS>
said
the
abbess
.
  
<EOS>
Strait
 
said
the
novice
;
for
terror
had
struck
their
understandings
 
<EOS>
the
one
knew
not
what
she
said
 
<EOS>
the
other
<EOS>
what
she
answer'd
.
  
<EOS>
O
my
virginity

<EOS>
virginity

cried
the
abbess

<EOS>

<EOS>
said
the
novice
,
sobbing
.
    
<EOS>
My
dear
mother
,
quoth
the
novice
,
coming
a
little
to
herself
,
 
there
are
two
certain
words
,
which
I
have
been
told
will
force
any
horse
,
or
ass
,
or
mule
,
to
go
up
a
hill
whether
he
will
or
no
;
<EOS>
be
he
never
so
obstinate
or
ill
-
will'd
,
the
moment
he
hears
them
<EOS>
utter'd
,
he
obeys
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
words
magic
!
<EOS>
cried
the
abbess
in
the
utmost
horror
 
No
;
replied
Margarita
calmly
 
<EOS>
but
they
are
words
sinful
 
<EOS>
What
are
they
?
<EOS>
quoth
<EOS>
the
abbess
,
interrupting
her
:
 
<EOS>
They
are
sinful
in
the
first
degree
,
answered
Margarita
,
 
they
are
mortal
 
<EOS>
and
if
we
are
ravished
and
die
unabsolved
of
them
,
we
shall
both-
<EOS>
but
you
may
pronounce
them
to
me
,
quoth
the
abbess
of
Andouillets
 
<EOS>
They
can
not
,
my
dear
mother
,
said
the
novice
,
be
pronounced
at
all
;
they
will
make
all
the
blood
in
one
's
body
fly
up
into
one
's
face
 
<EOS>
But
you
may
whisper
them
in
my
ear
,
quoth
the
abbess
.
  
<EOS>
Heaven
!
<EOS>
hadst
thou
<EOS>
no
guardian
angel
to
delegate
to
the
inn
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
?
<EOS>
was
there
no
generous
and
friendly
spirit
unemployed
 
no
agent
in
nature
,
by
some
monitory
shivering
,
creeping
along
the
artery
which
led
to
his
heart
,
to
rouse
the
muleteer
from
his
banquet
?
 
<EOS>
no
sweet
minstrelsy
to
bring
back
the
fair
idea
of
the
abbess
and
Margarita
,
with
their
black
rosaries
!
  
<EOS>
Rouse
!
rouse
!
 
<EOS>
but
'
tis
too
late
 
<EOS>
the
horrid
words
are
pronounced
this
moment
      
and
how
to
tell
them
 
Ye
,
who
can
speak
of
every
thing
existing
,
with
unpolluted
lips
 
<EOS>
instruct
me
 
<EOS>
guide
me
      
<EOS>
All
sins
whatever
,
quoth
the
abbess
,
turning
casuist
in
the
distress
they
were
under
,
are
held
by
the
confessor
of
our
convent
to
be
either
mortal
or
venial
:
 
<EOS>
there
is
no
further
division
.
 
<EOS>
Now
a
venial
sin
being
the
slightest
and
least
of
all
sins
 
being
halved
 
by
taking
either
only
the
half
of
it
,
and
leaving
the
rest
 
or
,
by
taking
it
all
,
and
amicably
halving
it
betwixt
yourself
and
another
person
 
<EOS>
in
course
becomes
diluted
into
no
sin
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
Now
I
see
no
sin
in
saying
,
bou
,
bou
,
bou
,
bou
,
bou
,
a
hundred
times
together
;
nor
is
there
any
turpitude
in

the
syllable
ger

ger

were
it
from

:
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
my
dear
daughter
,
continued
the
abbess
of
Andouillets
 
<EOS>
I
will
say
bou
,
and
thou
shalt
say
ger
;
and
then
alternately
,
as
there
is
no
more
sin
in
fou
than
in

Thou
shalt
say

And
accordingly
the

the

set

cried

But

said
the

of

<EOS>
What
a
tract
of
country
have
I
run
!
 
<EOS>
how
many
degrees
nearer
to
the
warm
sun
am
I
advanced
,
and
<EOS>
how
many
fair
and
goodly
cities
have
I
seen
,
during
the
time
you
have
been
reading
and
reflecting
,
Madam
,
upon
this
story
!
 
<EOS>
There
's
Fontainbleau
,
and
Sens
,
and
Joigny
,
and
Auxerre
,
and
Dijon
the
capital
of
Burgundy
,
and
Challon
,
and
Macon
the
capital
of
the
Maconese
,
and
a
score
more
upon
the
road
to
Lyons
 
<EOS>
and
now
I
have
run
them
over
 
<EOS>
I
might
as
well
talk
to
you
of
so
many
market
towns
in
the
moon
,
as
tell
you
one
word
about
them
:
 
<EOS>
it
will
be
this
chapter
at
the
least
,
if
not
both
this
and
the
next
entirely
lost
,
do
what
I
will
      
Why
,
'
tis
a
strange
story
!
<EOS>
Tristram
.
  
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
Madam
,
had
it
been
upon
some
melancholy
lecture
of
the
cross
 
the
peace
of
meekness
,
or
the
contentment
of
resignation
 
<EOS>
I
had
not
been
incommoded
:
 
or
had
I
thought
of
writing
it
upon
the
purer
abstractions
of
the
soul
,
and
that
food
of
wisdom
and
holiness
and
contemplation
,
upon
which
the
spirit
of
man
(
when
separated
from
the
body
)
is
to
subsist
for
ever
 
<EOS>
You
would
have
come
with
a
better
appetite
from
it
      
<EOS>
I
wish
I
never
had
wrote
it
:
 
<EOS>
but
as
I
never
blot
any
thing
out
 
let
us
use
some
honest
means
to
get
it
out
of
our
heads
directly
.
    
<EOS>
Pray
reach
me
my
fool
's
cap
 
<EOS>
I
fear
you
sit
upon
it
,
<EOS>
Madam
 
'
tis
under
the
cushion
 
<EOS>
I
'll
put
it
on
    
Bless
me
!
<EOS>
you
have
had
it
upon
your
head
this
half
hour
.

then

<EOS>
And
now
,
Madam
,
we
may
venture
<EOS>
,
I
hope
a
little
to
go
on
.
      
<EOS>
All
you
need
say
of
Fontainbleau
(
in
case
you
are
ask'd
)
is
,
that
it
stands
about
forty
miles
(
south
something
)
from
Paris
,
in
the
middle
of
a
large
forest
 
<EOS>
That
there
is
something
great
in
it
 
<EOS>
That
the
king
goes
there
once
every
two
or
three
years
,
with
his
whole
court
,
for
the
pleasure
of
the
chace
 
and
that
,
during
that
carnival
of
sporting
,
any
English
gentleman
of
fashion
(
you
need
not
forget
yourself
)
may
be
accommodated
with
a
nag
or
two
,
to
partake
of
the
sport
,
taking
care
only
not
to
out-
gallop
<EOS>
the
king
    
<EOS>
Though
there
are
two
reasons
why
you
need
not
talk
loud
of
this
to
every
one
.
  
<EOS>
First
,
Because
'
twill
make
the
said
nags
the
harder
to
be
got
;
and
  
<EOS>
Secondly
,
'
Tis
not
a
word
of
it
true
.
 
<EOS>
Allons
!
  
<EOS>
As
for
Sens
 
you
may
dispatch
 
in
a
word
 
"
'
Tis
an
archiepiscopal
see
.
"
    
<EOS>
For
Joigny
 
the
less
,
I
think
,
one
says
of
it
the
better
.
  
<EOS>
But
for
Auxerre
 
I
could
go
on
for
ever
:
 
for
in
my
grand
tour
through
Europe
,
in
which
,
after
all
,
my
father
(
not
caring
to
trust
me
with
any
one
)
attended
me
himself
,
with
my
uncle
Toby
,
and
Trim
,
and
Obadiah
,
and
indeed
most
of
the
family
,
except
my
mother
,
who
being
taken
up
with
a
project
of
knitting
my
father
a
pair
of
large
worsted
breeches
 
<EOS>
(
the
thing
is
common
sense
)
 
<EOS>
and
she
not
caring
to
be
put
out
of
her
way
<EOS>
,
she
staid
at
home
,
at
Shandy
Hall
,
to
keep
things
right
during
the
expedition
;
in
which
,
I
say
,
my
father
stopping
us
two
days
at
Auxerre
,
and
his
researches
being
ever
of
such
a
nature
,
that
they
would
have
found
fruit
even
in
a
desert
  
he
has
left
me
enough
to
say
upon
Auxerre
:
 
in
short
,
wherever
my
father
went
 
but
'
twas
more
remarkably
so
,
in
this
journey
through
France
and
Italy
,
than
in
any
other
stages
of
his
life
 
his
road
seemed
to
lie
so
much
on
one
side
of
that
,
wherein
all
other
travellers
have
gone
before
him
 
he
saw
kings
and
courts
and
silks
of
all
colours
,
in
such
strange
lights
 
and
his
remarks
and
reasonings
upon
the
characters
,
the
manners
,
and
customs
of
the
countries
we
pass'd
over
,
were
so
opposite
to
those
of
all
other
mortal
men
,
particularly
those
of
my
uncle
Toby
and
Trim
 
(
to
say
nothing
of
myself
)
 
and
to
crown
all
 
the
occurrences
and
scrapes
which
we
were
perpetually
meeting
and
getting
into
,
in
consequence
of
his
systems
and
opiniotry
 
<EOS>
they
were
of
<EOS>
so
odd
,
<EOS>
so
mix'd
and
tragi
-
comical
a
contexture
  
<EOS>
That
the
whole
put
together
,
it
appears
of
so
different
a
shade
and
tint
from
any
tour
of
Europe
,
which
was
ever
executed
 
that
I
will
venture
to
pronounce
 
<EOS>
the
fault
must
be
mine
and
mine
only
 
if
it
be
not
read
by
all
travellers
and
travel
-
readers
,
till
travelling
is
no
more
,
 
or
which
comes
to
the
same
point
 
till
the
world
,
finally
,
takes
it
into
its
head
to
stand
still
.
      
<EOS>
But
this
rich
bale
is
not
to
be
open'd
now
;
except
a
small
thread
or
two
of
it
,
merely
to
unravel
the
mystery
of
my
father
's
stay
at
Auxerre
.
    
<EOS>
As
I
have
mentioned
it
 
'
tis
too
slight
to
be
kept
suspended
;
and
when
'
tis
wove
in
,
there
is
an
end
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
We
'll
go
,
brother
Toby
,
said
my
father
,
whilst
dinner
is
coddling
 
to
the
abbey
of
Saint
Germain
,
if
it
be
only
to
see
these
bodies
,
of
which
Monsieur
Sequier
has
given
such
a
recommendation
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
go
see
any
body
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
<EOS>
;
for
he
was
all
compliance
through
every
step
of
the
journey
 
<EOS>
Defend
me
!
<EOS>
said
my
father
 
<EOS>
they
are
all
mummies
 
<EOS>
Then
one
need
not
shave
;
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
 
Shave
!
<EOS>
no
 
cried
my
father
 
'
<EOS>
twill
be
more
like
relations
to
go
with
our
beards
on
 
<EOS>
So
out
we
sallied
,
the
corporal
lending
his
master
his
arm
,
and
bringing
up
the
rear
,
to
the
abbey
of
Saint
Germain
.
  
<EOS>
Every
thing
is
very
fine
,
and
very
rich
,
and
very
superb
,
and
very
magnificent
,
said
my
father
,
addressing
himself
to
the
sacristan
,
who
was
a
younger
brother
of
the
order
of
Benedictines
 
<EOS>
but
our
curiosity
has
led
us
to
see
the
bodies
,
of
which
Monsieur
Sequier
has
given
the
world
so
exact
a
description
.
 
<EOS>
The
sacristan
made
a
bow
,
and
lighting
a
torch
first
,
which
he
had
always
in
the
vestry
ready
for
the
purpose
;
he
led
us
into
the
tomb
of
St.
Heribald
 
This
,
said
the
sacristan
,
laying
his
hand
upon
the
tomb
,
was
a
renowned
prince
of
the
house
of
Bavaria
,
who
under
the
successive
reigns
of
Charlemagne
,
Louis
le
Debonnair
,
and
Charles
the
Bald
,
bore
a
great
sway
in
the
government
,
and
had
a
principal
hand
in
bringing
every
thing
into
order
and
discipline
    
<EOS>
Then
he
has
been
as
great
,
said
my
uncle
,
in
the
field
,
as
in
the
cabinet
  
<EOS>
I
dare
say
he
has
been
a
gallant
soldier
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
monk
 
<EOS>
said
the
sacristan
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
and
Trim
sought
comfort
in
each
other
's
faces
 
but
found
it
not
:
 
my
father
clapped
both
his
hands
upon
his
cod
-
piece
,
which
was
a
way
he
had
when
any
thing
hugely
tickled
him
:
 
for
though
he
hated
a
monk
and
the
very
smell
of
a
monk
worse
than
all
the
devils
in
hell
 
yet
the
shot
hitting
my
uncle
Toby
and
Trim
so
much
harder
than
him
,
'
twas
a
relative
triumph
;
and
put
him
into
the
gayest
humour
in
the
world
.
    
<EOS>
And
pray
what
do
you
call
this
gentleman
?
<EOS>
quoth
<EOS>
my
father
,
rather
sportingly
:
 
This
tomb
,
said
the
young
Benedictine
,
looking
downwards
,
contains
the
bones
of
Saint
Maxima
,
who
came
from
Ravenna
on
purpose
to
touch
the
body
      
Of
Saint
Maximus
,
said
my
father
,
popping
in
with
his
saint
before
him
,
  
<EOS>
they
were
two
of
the
greatest
saints
in
the
whole
martyrology
,
added
my
father
 
Excuse
me
,
said
the
sacristan
 
'
twas
to
touch
the
bones
of
Saint
Germain
,
the
builder
of
the
abbey
 
<EOS>
And
what
did
she
get
by
it
?
<EOS>
said
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
What
does
any
woman
get
by
it
?
<EOS>
said
my
father
 
Martyrdome
;
replied
the
young
Benedictine
,
making
a
bow
down
to
the
ground
,
and
uttering
the
word
with
so
humble
,
but
decisive
a
cadence
,
it
disarmed
my
father
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
supposed
,
continued
the
Benedictine
,
that
St.
Maxima
has
lain
in
this
tomb
four
hundred
years
,
and
two
hundred
before
her
canonization
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
but
a
slow
rise
,
brother
Toby
,
quoth
my
father
,
in
this
self
-
same
army
of
martyrs
.
 
<EOS>
A
desperate
slow
one
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
said
Trim
,
unless
one
could
purchase
 
<EOS>
I
should
rather
sell
out
entirely
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
I
am
pretty
much
of
your
opinion
,
brother
Toby
,
said
my
father
.
    
<EOS>
Poor
St.
Maxima
!
<EOS>
said
my
uncle
Toby
low
to
himself
,
as
we
turn'd
<EOS>
from
her
tomb
:
 
<EOS>
She
was
one
of
the
fairest
and
most
beautiful
ladies
either
of
Italy
or
France
,
continued
the
sacristan
 
<EOS>
But
who
the
duce
has
got
lain
down
here
,
besides
her
?
<EOS>
quoth
<EOS>
my
father
,
pointing
with
his
cane
to
a
large
tomb
as
we
walked
on
 
<EOS>
It
is
Saint
Optat
,
Sir
,
answered
the
sacristan
 
<EOS>
And
properly
is
<EOS>
Saint
Optat
plac'd
!
said
my
father
:
 
<EOS>
And
what
is
Saint
Optat
's
story
?
<EOS>
continued
he
.
 
<EOS>
Saint
Optat
,
replied
the
sacristan
,
was
a
bishop
      
<EOS>
I
thought
so
,
by
heaven
!
<EOS>
cried
my
father
,
interrupting
him
 
Saint
Optat
!
 
<EOS>
how
should
Saint
Optat
fail
?
<EOS>
so
snatching
out
his
pocket
-
book
,
and
the
young
Benedictine
holding
him
the
torch
as
he
wrote
,
he
set
it
down
as
a
new
prop
to
his
system
of
Christian
names
,
and
I
will
be
bold
to
say
,
so
disinterested
was
he
in
the
search
of
truth
,
that
had
he
found
a
treasure
in
Saint
Optat
's
tomb
,
it
would
not
have
made
him
half
so
rich
:
 
<EOS>
'
Twas
as
successful
a
short
visit
as
ever
was
paid
to
the
dead
;
and
so
highly
was
his
fancy
pleas'd
with
all
that
had
passed
in
it
,
 
that
he
determined
at
once
to
stay
another
day
in
Auxerre
.
    
<EOS>
I
'll
see
the
rest
of
these
good
gentry
to
-
morrow
,
said
my
father
,
as
we
cross'd
over
the
square
 
<EOS>
And
while
you
are
paying
that
visit
,
brother
Shandy
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
the
corporal
<EOS>
and
I
will
mount
the
ramparts
.
      
<EOS>
Now
this
is
the
most
puzzled
skein
of
all
 
for
in
this
last
chapter
,
as
far
at
least
as
it
has
help'd
me
through
Auxerre
,
I
have
been
getting
forwards
in
two
different
journies
together
,
and
with
the
same
dash
of
the
pen
 
<EOS>
for
I
have
got
entirely
out
of
Auxerre
in
this
journey
which
I
am
writing
now
,
and
I
am
got
half
way
out
of
Auxerre
in
that
<EOS>
which
I
shall
write
hereafter
 
<EOS>
There
is
but
a
certain
degree
of
perfection
in
every
thing
;
and
by
pushing
at
something
beyond
that
,
I
have
brought
myself
into
such
a
situation
,
as
no
traveller
ever
stood
before
me
;
for
I
am
this
moment
walking
across
the
market
-
place
of
Auxerre
with
my
father
and
my
uncle
Toby
,
in
our
way
back
to
dinner
 
<EOS>
and
I
am
this
moment
also
entering
Lyons
with
my
post
-
chaise
<EOS>
broke
into
a
thousand
pieces
 
<EOS>
and
I
am
moreover
this
moment
in
a
handsome
pavillion
built
by
Pringello
(
The
same
Don
Pringello
,
the
celebrated
Spanish
architect
,
of
whom
my
cousin
Antony
has
made
such
honourable
mention
in
a
scholium
to
the
Tale
inscribed
to
his
name
.
 
<EOS>

)
<EOS>
,
upon
the
banks
of
the
Garonne
,
which
Mons
.
<EOS>
Sligniac
has
lent
me
,
and
where
I
now
sit
rhapsodising
all
these
affairs
.
    
<EOS>
Let
me
collect
myself
,
and
pursue
my
journey
.
    
<EOS>
I
am
glad
of
it
,
said
I
,
settling
the
account
with
myself
,
as
I
walk'd
<EOS>
into
Lyons
 
my
chaise
being
all
laid
higgledy
-
piggledy
with
my
baggage
in
a
cart
,
which
was
moving
slowly
before
me
 
<EOS>
I
am
heartily
glad
,
said
I
,
that
'
tis
all
broke
to
pieces
;
for
now
I
can
go
directly
by
water
to
Avignon
,
which
will
carry
me
on
a
hundred
and
twenty
miles
of
my
journey
,
and
not
cost
me
seven
livres
 
and
from
thence
,
continued
I
,
bringing
forwards
the
account
<EOS>
,
I
can
hire
a
couple
of
mules
 
or
asses
,
if
I
like
,
(
for
nobody
knows
me
,
)
and
cross
the
plains
of
Languedoc
for
almost
nothing
 
I
shall
gain
four
hundred
livres
by
the
misfortune
clear
into
my
purse
:
 
and
pleasure
!
<EOS>
worth
 
worth
double
the
money
by
it
.
 
<EOS>
With
what
velocity
,
continued
I
,
clapping
my
two
hands
together
,
shall
I
fly
down
the
rapid
Rhone
,
with
the
Vivares
on
my
right
hand
,
and
Dauphiny
on
my
left
,
scarce
seeing
the
ancient
cities
of
Vienne
,
Valence
,
and
Vivieres
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
flame
will
it
rekindle
in
the
lamp
,
to
snatch
a
blushing
grape
from
the
Hermitage
and
Cote
roti
,
as
I
shoot
by
the
foot
of
them
!
<EOS>
and
what
a
fresh
spring
in
the
blood
!
<EOS>
to
behold
upon
the
banks
advancing
and
retiring
,
the
castles
of
romance
,
whence
courteous
knights
have
whilome
rescued
the
distress'd
 
and
see
vertiginous
,
the
rocks
,
the
mountains
,
the
cataracts
,
and
all
the
hurry
which
Nature
is
in
with
all
her
great
works
about
her
.
  
<EOS>
As
I
went
on
thus
,
methought
my
chaise
,
the
wreck
of
which
look'd
<EOS>
stately
enough
at
the
first
,
insensibly
grew
less
and
less
in
its
size
;
the
freshness
of
the
painting
was
no
more
 
the
gilding
lost
its
lustre
 
and
the
whole
affair
appeared
so
poor
in
my
eyes
 
<EOS>
so
sorry
!
 
<EOS>
so
contemptible
!
<EOS>
and
,
in
a
word
,
so
much
worse
than
the
abbess
of
Andouillets
'
itself
 
that
I
was
just
opening
my
mouth
to
give
it
to
the
devil
 
when
a
pert
vamping
chaise-
undertaker
,
stepping
nimbly
across
the
street
,
demanded
if
Monsieur
would
have
his
chaise
refitted
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
<EOS>
,
said
I
,
shaking
my
head
sideways
 
<EOS>
Would
Monsieur
choose
to
sell
it
?
<EOS>
rejoined
the
undertaker
 
<EOS>
With
all
my
soul
,
said
I
 
<EOS>
the
iron
work
is
worth
forty
livres
 
and
the
glasses
worth
<EOS>
forty
more
  
<EOS>
and
the
leather
you
may
take
to
live
on
.
  
<EOS>
What
a
mine
of
wealth
,
quoth
<EOS>
I
,
as
he
counted
me
the
money
,
has
this
post-
chaise
brought
me
in
?
 
<EOS>
And
this
is
my
usual
method
of
book
-
keeping
,
at
least
with
the
disasters
of
life
 
making
a
penny
of
every
one
of
'em
as
they
happen
to
me
      
<EOS>
Do
,
my
dear
Jenny
,
tell
the
world
for
me
,
how
I
behaved
under
one
,
the
most
oppressive
of
its
kind
,
which
could
befal
me
as
a
man
,
proud
as
he
ought
to
be
of
his
manhood
    
@@@Tis
enough
,
saidst
thou
,
coming
close
up
to
me
,
as
I
stood
with
my
garters
in
my
hand
,
reflecting
upon
what
had
not
pass'd
 
<EOS>
"
Tis
enough
,
Tristram
,
and
I
am
satisfied
,
saidst
thou

whispering
these
words
in
my
ear
,
....

<EOS>
any
other
man
would
have
sunk
down
to
the
centre
      
<EOS>
Every
thing
is
good
for
something
,
quoth
I.
    
<EOS>
I
'll
go
into
Wales
for
six
weeks
,
and
drink
goat
's
whey
 
<EOS>
and
I
'll
gain
seven
years
longer
life
for
the
accident
.
 
<EOS>
For
which
reason
I
think
myself
inexcusable
,
for
blaming
Fortune
so
often
as
I
have
done
,
for
pelting
me
all
my
life
long
,
like
an
ungracious
duchess
,
as
I
call'd
her
,
with
so
many
small
evils
:
 
surely
,
if
I
have
any
cause
to
be
angry
with
her
,
'
tis
that
she
has
not
sent
me
great
ones
 
<EOS>
a
score
of
good
cursed
,
bouncing
losses
,
would
have
been
as
good
as
a
pension
to
me
.
    
<EOS>
One
of
a
hundred
a
year
,
or
so
,
is
all
I
wish
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
be
at
the
plague
of
paying
land
-
tax
for
a
larger
.
    
<EOS>
To
those
who
call
vexations
,
Vexations
,
as
knowing
what
they
are
,
there
could
not
be
a
greater
,
than
to
be
the
best
part
of
a
day
at
Lyons
,
the
most
opulent
and
flourishing
city
in
France
,
enriched
with
the
most
fragments
of
antiquity
 
and
not
be
able
to
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
withheld
upon
any
account
,
must
be
a
vexation
;
but
to
be
withheld
by
a
vexation
 
must
certainly
be
,
what
philosophy
justly
calls
 
Vexation
 
upon
 
Vexation
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
got
my
two
dishes
of
milk
coffee
(
which
by
the
bye
is
excellently
good
for
a
consumption
,
but
you
must
boil
the
milk
and
coffee
together
  
otherwise
'
tis
only
coffee
and
milk
)
 
<EOS>
and
as
it
was
no
more
than
eight
in
the
morning
,
and
the
boat
did
not
go
off
till
noon
,
I
had
time
to
see
enough
of
Lyons
to
tire
the
patience
of
all
the
friends
I
had
in
the
world
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
take
a
walk
to
the
cathedral
,
said
I
,
looking
at
my
list
,
and
see
the
wonderful
mechanism
of
this
great
clock
of
Lippius
of
Basil
,
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
    
Now
,
of
all
things
in
the
world
,
I
understand
the
least
of
mechanism
 
I
have
neither
genius
,
or
taste
,
or
fancy
 
and
have
a
brain
so
entirely
unapt
for
every
thing
of
that
kind
,
that
I
solemnly
declare
I
was
never
yet
able
to
comprehend
the
principles
of
motion
of
a
squirrel
cage
,
or
a
common
knife
-
grinder
's
wheel
 
<EOS>
tho
<EOS>
'
I
have
many
an
hour
of
my
life
look'd
<EOS>
up
with
great
devotion
at
the
one
 
and
stood
by
with
as
much
patience
as
any
christian
ever
could
do
,
at
the
other
    
<EOS>
I
'll
go
see
the
surprising
movements
of
this
great
clock
,
said
I
,
the
very
first
thing
I
do
:
 
<EOS>
and
then
I
will
pay
a
visit
to
the
great
library
of
the
Jesuits
,
and
procure
,
if
possible
,
a
sight
of
the
thirty
volumes
of
the
general
history
of
China
,
wrote
(
not
in
the
Tartarean
,
but
)
in
the
Chinese
language
,
and
in
the
Chinese
character
too
.
  
<EOS>
Now
I
almost
know
as
little
of
the
Chinese
language
,
as
I
do
of
the
mechanism
of
Lippius
's
clock
-
work
;
so
,
why
these
should
have
jostled
themselves
into
the
two
first
articles
of
my
list
 
<EOS>
I
leave
to
the
curious
as
a
problem
of
Nature
.
 
<EOS>
I
own
<EOS>
it
looks
like
one
of
her
ladyship
's
obliquities
;
and
they
who
court
her
,
are
interested
in
finding
out
her
humour
as
much
as
I.
  
<EOS>
When
these
curiosities
are
seen
,
quoth
<EOS>
I
,
half
addressing
myself
to
my
valet
de
place
,
who
stood
behind
me
 
'
twill
be
no
hurt
if
we
go
to
the
church
of
St.
Irenaeus
,
and
see
the
pillar
to
which
Christ
was
tied
 
and
after
that
,
the
house
where
Pontius
Pilate
lived
 
<EOS>
"
Twas
at
the
next
town
,
said
the
valet
de
place
 
at
Vienne
;
I
am
glad
of
it
,
said
I
,
rising
briskly
from
my
chair
,
and
walking
across
the
room
with
strides
twice
as
long
as
my
usual
pace
 
"
for
so
much
the
sooner
<EOS>
shall
I
be
at
the
Tomb
of
the
two
lovers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
What
was
the
cause
of
this
movement
,
and
why
I
took
such
long
strides
in
uttering
this
 
<EOS>
I
might
leave
to
the
curious
too
;
but
as
no
principle
of
clock
-
work
is
concerned
in
it
 
<EOS>
'
twill
be
as
well
for
the
reader
if
I
explain
it
myself
.
    
<EOS>
O
!
<EOS>
there
is
a
sweet
aera
in
the
life
of
man
,
when
(
the
brain
being
tender
and
fibrillous
,
and
more
like
pap
than
any
thing
else
)
 
a
story
read
of
two
fond
lovers
,
separated
from
each
other
by
cruel
parents
,
and
by
still
more
cruel
destiny
    
Amandus

There
is
a
soft
aera
in
every
gentle
mortal
's
life

where
such
a
story
affords
more
pabulum
to
the

than
all
the
Frusts

Crusts
,
and
Rusts
of
antiquity
,
which
travellers
can
cook
up
for
it

<EOS>
'
Twas
all
that
stuck
on
the
right
side
of
the
cullender
in
my
own
,
of
what
Spon
and
others
,
in
their
accounts
of
Lyons
,
had
strained
into
it
;
and
finding
,
moreover
,
in
some
Itinerary
,
but
in
what
God
knows
 
<EOS>
That
sacred
to
the
fidelity
of
Amandus
and
Amanda
,
a
tomb
was
built
without
the
gates
,
where
,
to
this
hour
,
lovers
called
upon
them
to
attest
their
truths
 
<EOS>
I
never
could
get
into
a
scrape
of
that
kind
in
my
life
,
but
this
tomb
of
the
lovers
would
,
somehow
or
other
,
come
in
at
the
close
 
<EOS>
nay
such
a
kind
of
empire
had
it
<EOS>
establish'd
over
me
,
that
I
could
seldom
think
or
speak
of
Lyons
 
and
sometimes
not
so
much
as
see
even
a
Lyons
-
waistcoat
,
but
this
remnant
of
antiquity
would
present
itself
to
my
fancy
;
and
I
have
often
said
in
my
wild
way
of
running
on
 
tho
"
<EOS>
I
fear
with
some
irreverence
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
this
shrine
(
neglected
as
it
was
)
as
valuable
as
that
of
Mecca
,
and
so
little
short
,
except
in
wealth
,
of
the
Santa
Casa
itself
,
that
some
time
or
other
,
I
would
go
a
pilgrimage
(
though
I
had
no
other
business
at
Lyons
)
on
purpose
to
pay
it
a
visit
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
my
list
,
therefore
,
of
Videnda
at
Lyons
,
this
,
tho
'
last
,
 
was
not
,
you
see
,
least
;
so
taking
a
dozen
or
two
of
longer
strides
than
usual
cross
my
room
,
just
whilst
it
passed
my
brain
,
I
walked
down
calmly
into
the
basse
cour
,
in
order
to
sally
forth
;
and
having
called
for
my
bill
 
as
it
was
uncertain
whether
I
should
return
to
my
inn
,
I
had
paid
it
 
<EOS>
had
moreover
given
the
maid
ten
sous
,
and
was
just
receiving
the
dernier
compliments
of
Monsieur
Le
Blanc
,
for
a
pleasant
voyage
down
the
Rhone
 
when
I
was
stopped
at
the
gate
        
'
Twas
by
a
poor
ass
,
who
had
just
turned
in
with
a
couple
of
large
panniers
upon
his
back
,
to
collect
eleemosynary
turnip
-
tops
and
cabbage-
leaves
;
and
stood
dubious
,
with
his
two
fore
-
feet
on
the
inside
of
the
threshold
,
and
with
his
two
hinder
feet
towards
the
street
,
as
not
knowing
very
well
whether
he
was
to
go
in
or
no
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
'
tis
an
animal
(
be
in
what
hurry
<EOS>
I
may
)
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
to
strike
 
<EOS>
there
is
a
patient
endurance
of
sufferings
,
wrote
so
unaffectedly
in
his
looks
and
carriage
,
which
pleads
so
mightily
for
him
,
that
it
always
disarms
me
;
and
to
that
degree
,
that
I
do
not
like
to
speak
unkindly
to
him
:
 
on
the
contrary
,
meet
him
where
I
will
 
whether
in
town
or
country
 
in
cart
or
under
panniers
 
whether
in
liberty
or
bondage
 
<EOS>
I
have
ever
something
civil
to
say
to
him
on
my
part
;
and
as
one
word
begets
another
(
if
he
has
as
little
to
do
as
I
)
 
I
generally
fall
into
conversation
with
him
;
and
surely
never
is
my
imagination
so
busy
as
in
framing
his
responses
from
the
etchings
of
his
countenance
 
and
where
those
carry
me
not
deep
enough
 
in
flying
from
my
own
heart
into
his
,
and
seeing
what
is
natural
for
an
ass
to
think
 
as
well
as
a
man
,
upon
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
In
truth
,
it
is
the
only
creature
of
all
the
classes
of
beings
below
me
,
with
whom
I
can
do
this
:
 
for
parrots
,
jackdaws
,
&
c.
 
<EOS>
I
never
exchange
a
word
with
them
 
nor
with
the
apes
,
&
c.
for
pretty
near
the
same
reason
;
they
act
by
rote
,
as
the
others
speak
by
it
,
and
equally
make
me
silent
:
<EOS>
nay
my
dog
and
my
cat
,
though
I
value
them
both
 
(
and
for
my
dog
he
would
speak
if
he
could
)
 
<EOS>
yet
somehow
or
other
,
they
neither
of
them
possess
the
talents
for
conversation
 
<EOS>
I
can
make
nothing
of
a
discourse
with
them
,
beyond
the
proposition
,
the
reply
,
and
rejoinder
,
which
terminated
my
father
's
and
my
mother
's
conversations
,
in
his
beds
of
justice
 
and
those
<EOS>
utter'd
 
<EOS>
there
's
an
end
of
the
dialogue
      
<EOS>
But
with
an
ass
,
I
can
commune
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
Come
,
Honesty
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
 
seeing
it
was
impracticable
to
pass
betwixt
him
and
the
gate
 
art
thou
for
coming
in
,
or
going
out
?
  
<EOS>
The
ass
twisted
his
head
round
to
look
up
the
street
    
<EOS>
Well
 
replied
I
 
<EOS>
we
'll
wait
a
minute
for
thy
driver
:
    
<EOS>
He
turned
his
head
thoughtful
about
,
and
looked
wistfully
the
opposite
way
    
I
understand
thee
perfectly
,
answered
I
 
<EOS>
If
thou
takest
a
wrong
step
in
this
affair
,
he
will
cudgel
thee
to
death
 
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
a
minute
is
but
a
minute
,
and
if
it
saves
a
fellow
-
creature
a
drubbing
,
it
shall
not
be
set
down
as
ill
-
spent
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
eating
the
stem
of
an
artichoke
as
this
discourse
went
on
,
and
in
the
little
peevish
contentions
of
nature
betwixt
hunger
and
unsavouriness
<EOS>
,
had
dropt
it
out
of
his
mouth
half
a
dozen
times
,
and
<EOS>
pick'd
it
up
again
  
God
help
thee
,
Jack
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
thou
hast
a
bitter
breakfast
<EOS>
on't
 
and
<EOS>
many
a
bitter
day
's
labour
,
 
and
many
a
bitter
blow
,
I
fear
,
for
its
wages
 
'
tis
all
 
all
bitterness
to
thee
,
<EOS>
whatever
life
is
to
others
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
thy
mouth
,
if
one
knew
the
truth
of
it
,
is
as
bitter
,
I
dare
say
,
as
soot
 
<EOS>
(
for
he
had
cast
aside
the
stem
)
and
thou
hast
not
a
friend
perhaps
in
all
this
world
,
that
will
give
thee
a
macaroon
.
 
<EOS>
In
saying
this
,
I
pull'd
out
a
paper
of
'em
,
which
I
had
just
purchased
,
and
gave
him
one
 
and
at
this
moment
that
I
am
telling
it
,
my
heart
smites
me
,
that
there
was
more
of
pleasantry
in
the
conceit
,
of
seeing
how
an
ass
would
eat
a
macaroon
 
than
of
benevolence
in
giving
him
one
,
which
presided
in
the
act
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
ass
had
eaten
his
macaroon
,
I
<EOS>
press'd
him
to
come
in
 
<EOS>
the
poor
beast
was
heavy
loaded
 
<EOS>
his
legs
seem'd
to
tremble
under
him
 
he
hung
rather
backwards
,
and
as
I
pull'd
<EOS>
at
his
halter
,
it
broke
short
in
my
hand
 
<EOS>
he
look'd
up
pensive
in
my
face
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
thrash
me
with
it
 
<EOS>
but
if
you
will
,
you
may
"
 
If
I
do
,
said
I
<EOS>
,
I
'll
be
d
<EOS>
....
d
.
  
<EOS>
The
word
was
but
one
-
half
of
it
pronounced
,
like
the
abbess
of
Andouillet
's
 
<EOS>
(
so
there
was
no
sin
in
it
)
 
<EOS>
when
a
person
coming
in
,
let
fall
a
thundering
bastinado
upon
the
poor
devil
's
crupper
,
which
put
an
end
to
the
ceremony
.
  
<EOS>
Out
upon
it
!
<EOS>
cried
I
 
<EOS>
but
the
interjection
was
equivocal
 
<EOS>
and
,
I
think
,
wrong
placed
too
 
for
the
end
of
an
osier
which
had
started
out
from
the
contexture
of
the
ass
's
panier
,
had
caught
hold
of
my
breeches
pocket
,
as
he
rush'd
by
me
,
and
rent
it
in
the
most
disastrous
direction
you
can
imagine
 
so
that
the
  
Out
upon
it
!
<EOS>
in
my
opinion
,
should
have
come
in
here
 
<EOS>
but
this
I
leave
to
be
settled
by
The
Reviewers
of
My
Breeches
,
which
I
have
brought
over
along
with
me
for
that
purpose
.
    
<EOS>
When
all
was
set
to
rights
,
I
came
down
stairs
again
into
the
basse
cour
with
my
valet
de
place
,
in
order
to
sally
out
towards
the
tomb
of
the
two
lovers
,
&
c.
 
and
was
a
second
time
stopp'd
<EOS>
at
the
gate
 
not
by
the
ass
 
<EOS>
but
by
the
person
who
struck
him
;
and
who
,
by
that
time
,
had
taken
possession
(
as
is
not
uncommon
after
a
defeat
)
of
the
very
spot
of
ground
where
the
ass
stood
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
commissary
sent
to
me
from
the
post
-
office
,
with
a
rescript
in
his
hand
for
the
payment
of
some
six
livres
odd
sous
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
what
account
?
<EOS>
said
I.
 
'
Tis
upon
the
part
of
the
king
,
replied
the
commissary
,
heaving
up
both
his
shoulders
      
<EOS>
My
good
friend
,
quoth
<EOS>
I
 
<EOS>
as
sure
as
I
am
I
 
<EOS>
and
you
are
you
      
<EOS>
And
who
are
you
?
<EOS>
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
puzzle
me
;
said
I.
      
<EOS>
But
it
is
an
indubitable
verity
,
continued
I
,
addressing
myself
to
the
commissary
,
changing
only
the
form
of
my
asseveration
 
that
I
owe
the
king
of
France
nothing
but
my
good
will
;
for
he
is
a
very
honest
man
,
and
I
wish
him
all
health
and
pastime
in
the
world
    
<EOS>
Pardonnez
moi
 
replied
the
commissary
,
you
are
indebted
to
him
six
livres
four
sous
,
for
the
next
post
from
hence
to
St.
Fons
,
in
your
route
to
Avignon
 
which
being
a
post
royal
,
you
pay
double
for
the
horses
and
postillion
 
<EOS>
otherwise
"
twould
have
amounted
to
no
more
than
three
livres
two
sous
      
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
go
by
land
;
said
I.
    
<EOS>
You
may
<EOS>
if
you
please
;
replied
the
commissary
    
<EOS>
Your
most
obedient
servant
 
said
I
,
making
him
a
low
bow
    
<EOS>
The
commissary
,
with
all
the
sincerity
of
grave
good
breeding
 
made
me
one
,
as
low
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
was
more
disconcerted
with
a
bow
in
my
life
.
    
<EOS>
The
devil
take
the
serious
character
of
these
people
!
<EOS>
quoth
<EOS>
I
 
<EOS>
(
aside
)
they
understand
no
more
of
Irony
than
this
    
<EOS>
The
comparison
was
standing
close
by
with
his
panniers
 
but
something
seal'd
up
my
lips
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
pronounce
the
name
    
Sir
,
said
I
,
collecting
myself
 
it
is
not
my
intention
to
take
post
      
<EOS>
But
you
may
 
said
he
,
persisting
in
his
first
reply
 
you
may
take
post
if
you
chuse
      
<EOS>
And
I
may
take
salt
to
my
pickled
herring
,
said
I
,
if
I
chuse
      
<EOS>
But
I
do
not
chuse
      
<EOS>
But
you
must
pay
for
it
,
whether
you
do
or
no
.
  
<EOS>
Aye
!
<EOS>
for
the
salt
;
said
I
(
I
know
)
      
<EOS>
And
for
the
post
too
;
added
he
.
 
<EOS>
Defend
me
!
<EOS>
cried
I
    
<EOS>
I
travel
by
water
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
down
the
Rhone
this
very
afternoon
 
<EOS>
my
baggage
is
in
the
boat
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
actually
paid
nine
livres
for
my
passage
    
<EOS>
C'est
tout
egal

'
tis
all
one

said
he
.
  
<EOS>
Bon
Dieu
!
<EOS>
what

pay
for
the
way
I
go

<EOS>
and
for
the
way
I
do
not
go
!
    
<EOS>
C'est
tout
egal
;
replied
the
commissary
      
<EOS>
The
devil
it
is
!
<EOS>
said
I
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
go
to
ten
thousand
Bastiles
first
    
O
England
!
<EOS>
England
!
<EOS>
thou
land
of
liberty
,
and
climate
of
good
sense
,
thou
tenderest
of
mothers
 
and
gentlest
of
nurses
,
cried
I
,
kneeling
upon
one
knee
,
as
I
was
beginning
my
apostrophe
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
director
of
Madam
Le
Blanc
's
conscience
coming
in
at
that
instant
,
and
seeing
a
person
in
black
,
with
a
face
as
pale
as
ashes
,
at
his
devotions
 
looking
still
paler
by
the
contrast
and
distress
of
his
drapery
 
<EOS>
ask'd
,
if
I
stood
in
want
of
the
aids
of
the
church
    
<EOS>
I
go
by
Water
 
<EOS>
said
I
 
<EOS>
and
here
's
another
<EOS>
will
be
for
making
me
pay
for
going
by
Oil
.
    
<EOS>
As
I
perceived
the
commissary
of
the
post
-
office
would
have
his
six
livres
four
sous
,
I
had
nothing
else
for
it
,
but
to
say
some
smart
thing
upon
the
occasion
,
worth
the
money
:
  
<EOS>
And
so
I
set
off
thus
:
      
And
pray
,
Mr.
Commissary
,
by
what
law
of
courtesy
is
a
defenceless
stranger
to
be
used
just
the
reverse
from
what
you
use
a
Frenchman
in
this
matter
?
  
<EOS>
By
no
means
;
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
Excuse
me
;
said
I
 
for
you
have
begun
,
Sir
,
with
first
tearing
off
my
breeches
-
<EOS>
and
now
you
want
my
pocket
    
<EOS>
Whereas
 
<EOS>
had
you
first
taken
my
pocket
,
as
you
do
with
your
own
people
 
and
then
left
me
bare
<EOS>
a####'d
<EOS>
after
 
I
had
been
a
beast
to
have
complain'd
    
<EOS>
As
it
is
      
'
Tis
contrary
to
the
law
of
nature
.
    
<EOS>
'
Tis
contrary
to
reason
.
    
<EOS>
'
Tis
contrary
to
the
Gospel
.
  
<EOS>
But
not
to
this
 
said
he
 
putting
a
printed
paper
into
my
hand
,
  
Par
le
Roy
.
    
<EOS>
'
Tis
a
pithy
prolegomenon
,
quoth
<EOS>
I
 
and
so
read
on
.
.
..
    
<EOS>
By
all
which
it
appears
,
quoth
I
,
having
read
it
over
,
a
little
too
rapidly
,
that
if
a
man
sets
out
in
a
post
-
chaise
from
Paris
 
he
must
go
on
travelling
in
one
,
all
the
days
of
his
life
 
or
pay
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
Excuse
me
,
said
the
commissary
,
the
spirit
of
the
ordinance
is
this
 
That
if
you
set
out
with
an
intention
of
running
post
from
Paris
to
Avignon
,
&
c.
you
shall
not
change
that
intention
or
mode
of
travelling
,
without
first
satisfying
the
fermiers
for
two
posts
further
than
the
place
you
repent
at
 
and
'
tis
founded
,
continued
he
,
upon
this
,
that
the
Revenues
are
not
to
fall
short
through
your
fickleness
      
O
by
heavens
!
<EOS>
cried
I
 
if
fickleness
is
taxable
in
France
 
we
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
make
the
best
peace
with
you
<EOS>
we
can
    
<EOS>
And
So
the
Peace
Was
Made
;
    
<EOS>
And
if
it
is
a
bad
one
 
as
Tristram
Shandy
laid
the
corner
-
stone
of
it
  
nobody
but
Tristram
Shandy
ought
to
be
hanged
.
    
<EOS>
Though
I
was
sensible
I
had
said
as
many
clever
things
to
the
commissary
 
<EOS>
as
came
to
six
livres
four
sous
,
yet
I
was
determined
to
note
down
the
imposition
amongst
my
remarks
before
I
retired
from
the
place
;
<EOS>
so
putting
my
hand
into
my
coat
-
pocket
for
my
remarks
 
(
which
,
by
the
bye
,
may
be
a
caution
to
travellers
to
take
a
little
more
care
of
their
remarks
for
the
future
)
<EOS>
"
my
remarks
were
stolen
"
 
<EOS>
Never
did
sorry
traveller
make
such
a
pother
and
racket
about
his
remarks
as
I
did
about
mine
,
upon
the
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
Heaven
!
<EOS>
earth
!
<EOS>
sea
!
<EOS>
fire
!
<EOS>
cried
I
,
calling
in
every
thing
to
my
aid
but
what
I
should
 
<EOS>
My
remarks
are
stolen
!
 
<EOS>
what
shall
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Commissary
!
<EOS>
pray
<EOS>
did
I
drop
any
remarks
,
as
I
stood
besides
you
?
    
<EOS>
You
dropp'd
<EOS>
a
good
many
very
singular
ones
;
replied
he
 
<EOS>
Pugh
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
those
were
but
a
few
,
not
worth
above
six
livres
<EOS>
two
sous
 
<EOS>
but
these
are
a
large
parcel
 
<EOS>
He
shook
his
head
 
Monsieur
Le
Blanc
!
<EOS>
Madam
Le
Blanc
!
<EOS>
did
you
see
any
papers
of
mine
?
 
<EOS>
you
maid
of
the
house
!
<EOS>
run
up
stairs
 
Francois
!
<EOS>
run
up
after
her
      
<EOS>
I
must
have
my
remarks
 
<EOS>
they
were
the
best
remarks
,
cried
I
,
that
ever
were
made
 
the
wisest
 
<EOS>
the
wittiest
 
<EOS>
What
shall
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
which
way
shall
I
turn
myself
?

Sancho
Panca
,
when
he
lost
his

's
Furniture

did
not
exclaim
more
bitterly
.
    
<EOS>
When
the
first
transport
was
over
,
and
the
registers
of
the
brain
were
beginning
to
get
a
little
out
of
the
confusion
into
which
this
jumble
of
cross
accidents
had
cast
them
 
it
then
presently
occurr'd
<EOS>
to
me
,
that
I
had
left
my
remarks
in
the
pocket
of
the
chaise
 
and
that
in
selling
my
chaise
,
I
had
sold
my
remarks
along
with
it
,
to
the
chaise

leave
this

may

into

For
my
own
part
,
if
ever
I
swore
a
whole
oath
into
a
vacancy
in
my
life
,
I
think
it
was
into
that
 
<EOS>
.........
,
said
I
 
<EOS>
and
so
my
remarks
through
France
,
which
were
as
full
of
wit
,
as
an
egg
is
full
of
meat
,
and
as
well
worth
four
hundred
guineas
,
as
the
said
egg
is
worth
a
penny
 
<EOS>
have
I
been
selling
here
to
a
chaise
-
vamper
 
for
four
Louis
d'Ors
 
and
giving
him
a
post
-
chaise
(
by
heaven
)
worth
six
into
the
bargain
;
had
it
been
to
Dodsley
,
or
Becket
,
or
any
creditable
bookseller
,
who
was
either
leaving
off
business
,
and
wanted
a
post
-
chaise
 
or
who
was
beginning
it
 
and
wanted
my
remarks
,
and
two
or
three
guineas
along
with
them
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
borne
it
 
but
to
a
chaise

<EOS>
shew
me
to
him
<EOS>
this

said
I
 
<EOS>
The
valet
de

put
on
his

,
and
led
the
way
 
and
I
pull'd
off
mine
,
as
I
pass'd
<EOS>
the
commissary
,
and
followed
him
.
    
<EOS>
When
we
arrived
at
the
chaise
-
vamper
's
house
,
both
the
house
and
the
shop
were
shut
up
;
it
was
the
eighth

,
the
nativity
of
the

<EOS>
the
whole
world
was
gone
out
a
May
-
poling
 
frisking
here
 
capering
there
 
<EOS>
no
body
cared
a
button
for
me
or
my
remarks
;
so
I
sat
me
down
upon
a
bench
by
the
door
,
philosophating
upon
my
condition
:
 
by
a
better
fate
than
usually
attends
me
<EOS>
,
I
had
not
waited
half
an
hour
,
when
the
mistress
came
in
to
take
the
papilliotes
from
off
her
hair
,
before
she
went
to
the
May
-
poles
    
<EOS>
The
French
women
,
by
the
bye
,
love
May
-
poles
,
a
la
folie
 
that
is
,
as
much
as
their
matins
 
give
'em
but
a
May
-
pole
,
whether
in
May
,
June
,
July
or
September
 
they
never
count
the
times
 
down
<EOS>
it
goes
 
'
tis
meat
,
drink
,
washing
,
and
lodging
to
'em
 
and
had
we
but
the
policy
,
an
'
please
your
worships
(
as
wood
is
a
little
scarce
in
France
)
,
to
send
them
but
plenty
of
May
-
poles
    
<EOS>
The
women
would
set
them
up
;
and
when
they
had
done
,
they
would
dance
round
them
(
and
the
men
for
company
)
till
they
were
all
blind
.
  
<EOS>
The
wife
of
the
chaise
-
vamper
stepp'd
<EOS>
in
,
I
told
you
,
to
take
the
papilliotes
from
off
her
hair
 
<EOS>
the
toilet
stands
still
for
no
man
 
<EOS>
so
she
jerk'd
off
her
cap
,
to
begin
with
them
as
she
open'd
<EOS>
the
door
,
in
doing
which
,
one
of
them
fell
upon
the
ground
 
<EOS>
I
instantly
saw
it
was
my
own
writing
    
O
Seigneur
!
<EOS>
cried
I
 
<EOS>
you
have
got
all
my
remarks
upon
your
head
,
Madam
!
  
<EOS>
J'en
suis
bien
mortifiee
,
said
she
 
<EOS>
'
tis
<EOS>
well
,
thinks
I
,
they
have
stuck
there
 
for
<EOS>
could
they
have
gone
deeper
,
they
would
have
made
such
confusion
in
a
French
woman
's
noddle
 
<EOS>
She
had
better
have
gone
with
it
unfrizled
,
to
the
day
of
eternity
.
  
<EOS>
Tenez
 
said
she
 
so
without
any
idea
of
the
nature
of
my
suffering
,
she
took
them
from
her
curls
,
and
put
them
gravely
one
by
one
into
my
hat
 
one
was
twisted
this
way
 
<EOS>
another
twisted
that
 
ey
!
<EOS>
by
my
faith
;
and
when
they
are
published
,
quoth
<EOS>
I
,
    
<EOS>
They
will
be
worse
twisted
still
.
    
<EOS>
And
now
for
Lippius
's
clock
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
with
the
air
of
a
man
,
who
had
got
thro
'
<EOS>
all
his
difficulties
 
<EOS>
nothing
can
prevent
us
seeing
that
,
and
the
Chinese
history
,
&
c.
except
the
time
,
said
Francois
 
for
'
tis
almost
eleven
 
<EOS>
then
we
must
speed
the
faster
,
said
I
,
striding
it
away
to
the
cathedral
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
,
in
my
heart
,
that
it
gave
me
any
concern
in
being
told
by
one
of
the
minor
canons
,
as
I
was
entering
the
west
door
,
 
That
Lippius
's
great
clock
was
all
out
of
joints
,
and
had
not
gone
for
some
years
 
<EOS>
It
will
give
me
the
more
time
,
thought
<EOS>
I
,
to
peruse
the
Chinese
history
;
and
besides
I
shall
be
able
to
give
the
world
a
better
account
of
the
clock
in
its
decay
,
than
I
could
have
done
in
its
flourishing
condition
      
<EOS>
And
so
away
I
posted
to
the
college
of
the
Jesuits
.
  
<EOS>
Now
it
is
with
the
project
of
getting
a
peep
at
the
history
of
China
in
Chinese
characters
 
as
with
many
others
I
could
mention
,
which
strike
the
fancy
only
at
a
distance
;
for
as
I
came
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
point
 
my
blood
cool'd
 
<EOS>
the
freak
gradually
went
off
,
till
at
length
I
would
not
have
given
a
cherry
-
stone
to
have
it
gratified
 
<EOS>
The
truth
was
,
my
time
was
short
,
and
my
heart
was
at
the
Tomb
of
the
Lovers
 
<EOS>
I
wish
to
God
,
said
I
,
as
I
got
the
rapper
in
my
hand
,
that
the
key
of
the
library
may
be
but
lost
;
it
fell
out
as
well
    
<EOS>
For
all
the
Jesuits
had
got
the
cholic
 
and
to
that
degree
,
as
never
was
known
in
the
memory
of
the
oldest
practitioner
.
    
<EOS>
As
I
knew
the
geography
of
the
Tomb
of
the
Lovers
,
as
well
as
if
I
had
lived
twenty
years
in
Lyons
,
namely
,
that
it
was
upon
the
turning
of
my
right
hand
,
just
without
the
gate
,
leading
to
the
Fauxbourg
de
Vaise
 
<EOS>
I
dispatched
Francois
to
the
boat
,
that
I
might
pay
the
homage
<EOS>
I
so
long
ow'd
it
,
without
a
witness
of
my
weakness
 
I
<EOS>
walk'd
<EOS>
with
all
imaginable
joy
towards
the
place
 
when
I
saw
the
gate
which
intercepted
the
tomb
,
my
heart
glowed
within
me
      
Tender
and
faithful
spirits
!
<EOS>
cried
I
,
addressing
myself
to
Amandus
and
Amanda
 
long
 
long
have
I
tarried
to
drop
this
tear
upon
your
tomb
 
<EOS>
I
come
 
<EOS>
I
come
    
<EOS>
When
I
came
 
there
was
no
tomb
to
drop
it
upon
.
  
<EOS>
What
would
I
have
given
for
my
uncle
Toby
,
to
have
whistled
Lillo
bullero
!
    
<EOS>
No
matter
how
,
or
in
what
mood
 
<EOS>
but
I
flew
from
the
tomb
of
the
lovers
 
or
rather
<EOS>
I
did
not
fly
from
it
 
(
for
there
was
no
such
thing
existing
)
and
just
got
time
enough
to
the
boat
to
save
my
passage
;
 
and
ere
<EOS>
I
had
sailed
a
hundred
yards
,
the
Rhone
and
the
Saon
met
together
,
and
carried
me
down
merrily
betwixt
them
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
have
described
this
voyage
down
the
Rhone
,
before
I
made
it
      
<EOS>
So
now
I
am
at
Avignon
,
and
as
there
is
nothing
to
see
but
the
old
house
,
in
which
the
duke
of
Ormond
resided
,
and
nothing
to
stop
me
but
a
short
remark
upon
the
place
,
in
three
minutes
you
will
see
me
crossing
the
bridge
upon
a
mule
,
with
Francois
upon
a
horse
with
my
portmanteau
behind
him
,
and
the
owner
of
both
,
striding
the
way
before
us
,
with
a
long
gun
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
a
sword
under
his
arm
,
lest
peradventure
we
should
run
away
with
his
cattle
.
 
<EOS>
Had
you
seen
my
breeches
in
entering
Avignon
,
 
<EOS>
Though
you
'd
have
seen
them
better
,
I
think
,
as
I
mounted
 
you
would
not
have
thought
the
precaution
amiss
,
or
found
in
your
heart
to
have
taken
it
in
dudgeon
;
for
my
own
part
,
I
took
it
most
kindly
;
and
determined
to
make
him
a
present
of
them
,
when
we
got
to
the
end
of
our
journey
,
for
the
trouble
they
had
put
him
to
,
of
arming
himself
at
all
points
against
them
.
  
<EOS>
Before
I
go
further
,
let
me
get
rid
of
my
remark
upon
Avignon
,
which
is
this
:
 
That
I
think
it
wrong
,
merely
because
a
man
's
hat
has
been
blown
off
his
head
by
chance
the
first
night
he
comes
to
Avignon
,
 
that
he
should
therefore
say
,
"
Avignon
is
more
subject
to
high
winds
than
any
town
in
all
France
:
"
 
for
which
reason
I
laid
no
stress
upon
the
accident
till
I
had
enquired
of
the
master
of
the
inn
about
it
,
who
telling
me
seriously
it
was
so
 
and
hearing
,
moreover
,
the
windiness
of
Avignon
spoke
of
in
the
country
about
as
a
proverb
 
<EOS>
I
set
it
down
,
merely
to
ask
the
learned
what
can
be
the
cause
 
<EOS>
the
consequence
I
saw
 
<EOS>
for
they
are
all
Dukes
,
Marquisses
,
and
Counts
,
there
 
the
duce
a
Baron
,
in
all
Avignon
 
so
that
there
is
scarce
any
talking
to
them
on
a
windy
day
.
  
<EOS>
Prithee
,
friend
,
said
I
,
take
hold
of
my
mule
for
a
moment
 
for
I
wanted
to
pull
off
one
of
my
jack
-
boots
,
which
hurt
my
heel
 
<EOS>
the
man
was
standing
quite
idle
at
the
door
of
the
inn
,
and
as
I
had
taken
it
into
my
head
,
he
was
someway
concerned
about
the
house
or
stable
<EOS>
,
I
put
the
bridle
into
his
hand
 
<EOS>
so
begun
with
the
boot
:
 
<EOS>
when
I
had
finished
the
affair
,
I
turned
about
to
take
the
mule
from
the
man
,
and
thank
him
      
<EOS>
But
Monsieur
le
Marquis
had
walked
in
      
<EOS>
I
had
now
the
whole
south
of
France
,
from
the
banks
of
the
Rhone
to
those
of
the
Garonne
,
to
traverse
upon
my
mule
at
my
own
leisure
 
at
my
own
leisure
 
<EOS>
for
I
had
left
Death
,
the
Lord
knows
 
and
He
only
 
how
far
behind
me
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
followed
many
a
man
thro
"
<EOS>
France
,
quoth
<EOS>
he
 
but
never
at
this
mettlesome
rate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Still
he
followed
,
 
and
still
I
fled
him
 
<EOS>
but
I
fled
him
cheerfully
 
<EOS>
still
he
pursued
 
<EOS>
but
,
like
one
who
pursued
his
prey
without
hope
 
as
he
lagg'd
,
every
step
he
lost
,
softened
his
looks
 
<EOS>
why
should
I
fly
him
at
this
rate
?
  
<EOS>
So
notwithstanding
all
the
commissary
of
the
post
-
office
had
said
,
I
changed
the
mode
of
my
travelling
once
more
;
and
,
after
so
precipitate
and
rattling
a
course
as
I
had
run
,
I
flattered
my
fancy
with
thinking
of
my
mule
,
and
that
I
should
traverse
the
rich
plains
of
Languedoc
upon
his
back
,
as
slowly
as
foot
could
fall
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
more
pleasing
to
a
traveller
 
or
more
terrible
to
travel-
writers
,
than
a
large
rich
plain
;
especially
if
it
is
without
great
rivers
or
bridges
;
and
presents
nothing
to
the
eye
,
but
one
unvaried
picture
of
plenty
:
 
for
after
they
have
once
told
you
,
that
'
tis
delicious
!
<EOS>
or
delightful
!
<EOS>
(
as
the
case
happens
)
 
that
the
soil
was
grateful
,
and
that
nature
pours
out
all
her
abundance
,
&
c.
.
<EOS>
.they
have
then
a
large
plain
upon
their
hands
,
which
they
know
not
what
to
do
with
 
and
which
is
of
little
or
no
use
to
them
but
to
carry
them
to
some
town
;
and
that
town
,
perhaps
of
little
more
,
but
a
new
place
to
start
from
to
the
next
plain
  
and
so
on
.
    
<EOS>
This
is
most
terrible
work
;
judge
if
I
do
n't
manage
my
plains
better
.
    
<EOS>
I
had
not
gone
above
two
leagues
and
a
half
,
before
the
man
with
his
gun
began
to
look
at
his
priming
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
three
several
times
loiter'd
terribly
behind
;
half
a
mile
at
least
every
time
;
once
,
in
deep
conference
with
a
drum
-
maker
,
who
was
making
drums
for
the
fairs
of
Baucaira
and
Tarascone
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
understand
the
principles
    
<EOS>
The
second
time
,
I
can
not
so
properly
say
,
I
stopp'd
 
for
meeting
a
couple
of
Franciscans
straitened
more
for
time
than
myself
,
and
not
being
able
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
what
I
was
about
 
<EOS>
I
had
turn'd
<EOS>
back
with
them
    
<EOS>
The
third
,
was
an
affair
of
trade
with
a
gossip
,
for
a
hand
-
basket
of
Provence
figs
for
four
sous
;
this
would
have
been
transacted
at
once
;
but
for
a
case
of
conscience
at
the
close
of
it
;
for
when
the
figs
were
paid
for
,
it
turn'd
out
,
that
there
were
two
dozen
of
eggs
covered
over
with
vine
-
leaves
at
the
bottom
of
the
basket
 
as
I
had
no
intention
of
buying
eggs
 
<EOS>
I
made
no
sort
of
claim
of
them
 
as
for
the
space
they
had
occupied
  
what
signified
it
?
 
<EOS>
I
had
figs
enow
for
my
money
      
<EOS>
But
it
was
my
intention
to
have
the
basket
 
<EOS>
it
was
the
gossip
's
intention
to
keep
it
,
without
which
,
she
could
do
nothing
with
her
eggs
 
and
unless
I
had
the
basket
,
I
could
do
as
little
with
my
figs
,
which
were
too
ripe
already
,
and
most
of
'em
burst
at
the
side
:
 
<EOS>
this
brought
on
a
short
contention
,
which
terminated
in
sundry
proposals
,
<EOS>
what
we
should
both
do
      
<EOS>
How
we
disposed
of
our
eggs
and
figs
,
I
defy
you
,
or
the
Devil
himself
,
<EOS>
had
he
not
been
there
(
which
I
am
persuaded
he
was
)
,
to
form
the
least
probable
conjecture
:
 
<EOS>
You
will
read
the
whole
of
it
 
not
this
year
,
for
I
am
hastening
to
the
story
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
amours
 
<EOS>
but
you
will
read
it
in
the
collection
of
those
which
have
arose
out
of
the
journey
across
this
plain
 
and
which
<EOS>
,
therefore
,
I
call
my
  
Plain
Stories
.
  
<EOS>
How
far
my
pen
has
been
fatigued
,
like
those
of
other
travellers
,
in
this
journey
of
it
,
over
so
barren
a
track
 
<EOS>
the
world
must
judge
 
but
the
traces
of
it
,
which
are
now
all
set
o
'
vibrating
together
this
moment
,
tell
me
'
tis
the
most
fruitful
and
busy
period
of
my
life
;
for
as
I
had
made
no
convention
with
my
man
with
the
gun
,
as
to
time
 
by
stopping
and
talking
to
every
soul
I
met
,
who
was
not
in
a
full
trot
 
joining
all
parties
before
me
 
waiting
for
every
soul
behind
 
hailing
all
those
who
were
coming
through
cross
-
roads
 
arresting
all
kinds
of
beggars
,
pilgrims
,
fiddlers
,
friars
 
not
passing
by
a
woman
in
a
mulberry
-
tree
without
commending
her
legs
,
and
tempting
her
into
conversation
with
a
pinch
of
snuff
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
by
seizing
every
handle
,
of
what
size
or
shape
soever
,
which
chance
held
out
to
me
in
this
journey
 
I
turned
my
plain
into
a
city
 
<EOS>
I
was
always
in
company
,
and
with
great
variety
too
;
and
as
my
mule
loved
society
as
much
as
myself
,
and
had
some
proposals
always
on
his
part
to
offer
to
every
beast
he
met
 
<EOS>
I
am
confident
we
could
have
passed
through
Pall
-
Mall
,
or
St.
James's
-
Street
,
for
a
month
together
,
with
fewer
adventures
 
and
seen
less
of
human
nature
.
  
<EOS>
O
!
<EOS>
there
is
that
sprightly
frankness
,
which
at
once
unpins
every
plait
of
a
Languedocian
's
dress
 
<EOS>
that
whatever
is
beneath
it
,
it
looks
so
like
the
simplicity
which
poets
sing
of
in
better
days
 
I
will
delude
my
fancy
,
and
believe
it
is
so
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Twas
in
the
road
<EOS>
betwixt
Nismes
and
Lunel
,
where
there
is
the
best

wine
in
all
France
,
and
which
by
the
bye
belongs
to
the
honest
canons

Montpellier

the

The
sun
was
set
 
they
had
done
their
work
;
the
nymphs
had
tied
up
their
hair
afresh

the

were
preparing

I

I
never

argue
a
point
with
one

as
long

A
sun
-
burnt
daughter
of
Labour
rose
up
from
the
groupe
to
meet
me
,
as
I
advanced
towards
them
;
her
hair
,
which
was
a
dark
chesnut
approaching
rather
to
a
black
,
was
tied
up
in
a
knot
,
all
but
a
single
tress
.
  
<EOS>
We
want
a
cavalier
,
said
she
,
holding
out
both
her
hands
,
as
if
to
offer
them
 
<EOS>
And
a
cavalier
ye
shall
have
;
said
I
,
taking
hold
of
both
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
Hadst
thou
,
Nannette
,
been
array'd
like
a
duchesse
!
    
<EOS>
But
that
cursed
slit
in
thy
petticoat
!
  
<EOS>
Nannette
cared
not
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
We
could
not
have
done
without
you
,
said
she
,
letting
go
one
hand
,
with
self

politeness
,
leading
me
up
with
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
A
lame
youth
,
whom
Apollo
had
recompensed
with
a
pipe
,
and
to
which
he
had
added
a
tabourin
of
his
own
accord
,
ran
sweetly
over
the
prelude
,
as
he
sat
upon
the
bank
 
Tie
me
up
this
tress
instantly
,
said
Nannette
,
putting
a
piece
of
string
into
my
hand
 
<EOS>
It
taught
me
to
forget
I
was
a
stranger
 
<EOS>
The
whole
knot
fell
down
 
<EOS>
We
had
been
seven
years
acquainted
.
  
<EOS>
The
youth
struck
the
note
upon
the
tabourin
 
his
pipe
followed
,
and
off
we
bounded
 
<EOS>
"

that
slit

<EOS>
The
sister
of
the
youth

who
had
stolen

Just
Disposer

cried
I
<EOS>
,
why
could
not
a
man
sit
down
in
the
lap
of
content
here
 
and
dance
,
and
sing
,
and
say
his
prayers
,
and
go
to
heaven
with
this
nut

brown
maid
?
 
<EOS>
Capriciously
did
she
bend
her
head
on
one
side
,
and
dance
up
insidious
 
Then
'
tis
time
to
dance
off
,
quoth
I
;
so
changing
only
partners
and
tunes
<EOS>
,
I
danced
it
away
from
Lunel
to
Montpellier
 
from
thence
to
Pescnas
,
Beziers
 
<EOS>
I
danced
it
along
through
Narbonne
,
Carcasson
,
and
Castle
Naudairy
,
till
at
last
I
danced
myself
into
Perdrillo
's
pavillion
,
where
pulling
out
a
paper
of
black
lines
,
that
I
might
go
on
straight
forwards
,
without
digression
or
parenthesis
,
in
my
uncle
Toby

amours
    
<EOS>
I
begun
thus
        
<EOS>
But
softly
 
for
in
these
sportive
plains
,
and
under
this
genial
sun
,
where
at
this
instant
all
flesh
is
running
out
piping
,
fiddling
,
and
dancing
to
the
vintage
,
and
every
step
that
's
taken
,
the
judgment
is
surprised
by
the
imagination

I
defy

notwithstanding
all
that
has
been
said
upon
straight
lines
(
Vid

<EOS>
Vol

<EOS>
in
sundry
pages

I
defy
the
best
cabbage
planter
that
ever
existed
,
whether
he
plants
backwards
or
forwards
<EOS>

it
makes
little
difference
in

except
that
he
will
have
more
to
answer
for
in
the
one
case
than
in
the
other
)
 
<EOS>
I
defy
him
to
go
on
coolly
,
critically
,
and
canonically
,
planting
his
cabbages
one
by
one
,
in
straight
lines
,
and
stoical
distances

especially
if
slits
in
petticoats
are
unsew'd
up
 
without
ever

straddling
out

sidling
into
some
bastardly
digression
 
In

wot

clear
climate

gets
vent
 
in

my

it
is
likely
to
turn
out
!
  
<EOS>
Let
us
begin
it
.
    
<EOS>
It
is
with
Love
as
with
Cuckoldom
    
<EOS>
But
now
I
am
talking
of
beginning
a
book
,
and
have
long
had
a
thing
upon
my
mind
to
be
imparted
to
the
reader
,
which
,
if
not
imparted
now
,
can
never
be
imparted
to
him
as
long
as
I
live
(
whereas
the
Comparison
may
be
imparted
to
him
any
hour
in
the
day
)
 
<EOS>
I
'll
just
mention
it
,
and
begin
in
good
earnest
.
  
<EOS>
The
thing
is
this
.
  
<EOS>
That
of
all
the
several
ways
of
beginning
a
book
which
are
now
in
practice
throughout
the
known
world
,
I
am
confident
my
own
way
of
doing
it
is
the
best
 
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
it
is
the
most
religious
 
<EOS>
for
I
begin
with
writing
the
first
sentence
 
and
trusting
to
Almighty
God
for
the
second
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Twould
cure
an
author
for
ever
of
the
fuss
and
folly

opening
his
street

door

and
calling
in
his
neighbours

friends
,
and
kinsfolk
,
with
the
devil
and
all
his
imps

with
their
hammers
and
engines

to
observe
how
one
sentence

mine
follows
another

how
the
plan
follows
the
whole

I
wish
you
saw
me
half
starting
out
of
my
chair
,
with
what
confidence
,
as
I
grasp
the
elbow
of
it
,
I
look
up
 
catching
the
idea
,
even
sometimes
before
it
<EOS>
half
way
reaches
me
    
I
believe
in
my
conscience
I
intercept
many
a
thought
which
heaven
intended
for
another

I
think
there
is
no

for
it

<EOS>
Now
this

a
little
bald

frequently
putting
off

on

before
she
was
got
with
child
by
the
coachman
 
<EOS>
not
one
of
our
family
would
wear
it
after
.
 
<EOS>
To
cover
the
Mask
afresh
,
was
more
than
the
mask
was
worth
 
and
to
wear
a
mask
which
was
bald
,
or
which
could
be
half
seen
through
,
was
as
bad
as
having
no
mask
at
all
    
<EOS>
This
is
the
reason
,
<EOS>
may
it
please
your
reverences
,
that
in
all
our
numerous
family
,
for
these
four
generations
,
we
count
no
more

this

Of

push'd
<EOS>
his
researches
,
thro
'
such
a
contention
of
feelings

and
<EOS>
he
had
infallibly
let
them
all
run
on

we

see
what
they
would
turn
out
 
<EOS>

Bridget

pre

notification
of
them
to
Susannah

and
Susannah
's
repeated
manifestoes
thereupon
to
all
the

made
it
necessary
for
my
uncle
Toby
to
look
into
the
affair
.
    
<EOS>
Why
weavers
,
gardeners
,
and
gladiators
 
or
a
man
with
a
pined
leg
(
proceeding
from
some
ailment
in
the

should
ever
have
had
some
tender
nymph

her
heart
in

A
water

drinker
,
provided
he
is
a
profess'd
one
,
and
does
it
without

is
precisely
in

I
wish
my
uncle
Toby
had
been
a
water
-
drinker
;
for
then
the
thing
had
been
accounted
for
,
That
the
first
moment
Widow
Wadman
saw
him
,
she
felt
something
stirring
within
her
in
his
favour
 
Something
!
 
<EOS>
something
.
    
<EOS>
Something
perhaps
more
than
friendship
 
less
than
love
 
something
 
<EOS>
no
matter
what
 
no
matter
where
 
I
would
not
give
a
single
hair
off
my
mule
's
tail
,
and
be
obliged
to
pluck
it
off
myself
(
indeed
the
villain
has
not
many
to
spare
,
and
is
not
a
little
vicious
into
the
bargain
)
,
to
be
let
by
your
worships
into
the
secret
    
<EOS>
But
the
truth
is
,
my
uncle
Toby
was
not
a
water
-
drinker
;
he
drank
it
neither
pure
nor
mix'd
,
or
any
how
,
or
any
where
,
except
fortuitously
upon
some
advanced
posts
,
where
better
liquor
was
not
to
be
had
 
or
during
the
time
he
was
under
cure
;
when
the
surgeon
telling
him
it
would
extend
the
fibres
,
and
bring
them
sooner
into
contact
 
my
uncle
Toby
drank
it
for
quietness
sake
.
  
<EOS>
Now
as
all
the
world
knows
,
that
no
effect
in
nature
can
be
produced
without
a
cause
,
and
as
it
is
as
well
known
,
that
my
uncle
Toby
was
neither
a
weaver
 
<EOS>
a
gardener
,
or
a
gladiator
 
<EOS>
unless
as
a
captain
,
you
will
needs
have
him
one
 
<EOS>
but
then
he
was
only
a
captain
of
foot
 
and
besides
,
the
whole
is
an
equivocation
 
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
left
for
us
to
suppose
,
but
that
my
uncle
Toby
's
leg
 
<EOS>
but
that
will
avail
us
little
in
the
present
hypothesis
,
unless
it
had
proceeded
from
some
ailment
in
the
foot
 
<EOS>
whereas
his
leg
was
not
emaciated
from
any
disorder
in
his
foot
 
for
my
uncle
Toby
's
leg
was
not
emaciated
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
little
stiff
and
awkward
,
from
a
total
disuse
of
it
,
for
the
three
years
he
lay
confined
at
my
father
's
house
in
town
;
but
it
was
plump
and
muscular
,
and
in
all
other
respects
as
good
and
promising
a
leg
as
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
I
declare
,
I
do
not
recollect
any
one
opinion
or
passage
of
my
life
,
where
my
understanding
was
more
at
a
loss
to
make
ends
meet
,
and
torture
the
chapter
I
had
been
writing
,
to
the
service
of
the
chapter
following
it
,
than
in
the
present
case
:
 
<EOS>
one
would
think
I
took
a
pleasure
in
running
into
difficulties
of
this
kind
,
merely
to
make
fresh
experiments
of
getting
out
of
'em
 
<EOS>
Inconsiderate
soul
that
thou
art

<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
are
not
the
unavoidable
distresses
with
which
,
as
an
author
and
a
man
,
thou
art
hemm'd
<EOS>
in
on
every
side
of
thee
 
are
they
,
Tristram
,
not
sufficient
,
but
thou
must
entangle
thyself
still
more
?
  
<EOS>
Is
it
not
enough
that
thou
art
in
debt
,
and
that
thou
hast
<EOS>
ten
cart
-
loads
of
thy
fifth
and
sixth
volumes
<EOS>
(
Alluding
to
the
first
edition

<EOS>
still
  
still
unsold
,
and
art
almost
at
thy
<EOS>
wit
's
ends
,
how
to
get
them
off
thy
hands
?
  
<EOS>
To
this
hour
art
thou
not
tormented
with
the
vile
asthma
that
thou
gattest
in
skating
against
the
wind
in
Flanders
?
<EOS>
and
is
it
but
two
months
ago
,
that
in
a
fit
of
laughter
,
on
seeing
a
cardinal
make
water
like
a
quirister
(
with
both
hands
)
<EOS>
thou
brakest
a
vessel
in
thy
lungs
,
<EOS>
whereby
,
in
two
hours
,
thou
lost
as
many
quarts
of
blood
;
and
hadst
thou
lost
as
much
more
<EOS>
,
did
not
the
faculty
tell
thee
 
it
would
have
amounted
to
a
gallon
?
        
<EOS>
But
for
heaven
's
sake
,
let
us
not
talk
of
quarts
or
gallons
 
<EOS>
let
us
take
the
story
straight
before
us
;
it
is
so
nice
and
intricate
a
one
,
it
will
scarce
bear
the
transposition
of
a
single
tittle
;
and
,
somehow
or
other
,
you
have
got
me
thrust
almost
into
the
middle
of
it
      
<EOS>
I
beg
we
may
take
more
care

<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
and
the
corporal
had
posted
down
with
so
much
heat
and
precipitation
,
to
take
possession
of
the
spot
of
ground
we
have
so
often
spoke
of
,
in
order
to
open
their
campaign
as
early
as
the
rest
of
the
allies
;
that
they
had
forgot
one
of
the
most
necessary
articles
of
the
whole
affair
<EOS>
,
it
was
neither
a
pioneer
's
spade
,
a
pickax
,
or
a
shovel
      
<EOS>
It
was
a
bed
to
lie
on
:
 
so
that
as
Shandy
-
Hall
was
at
that
time
unfurnished
;
and
the
little
inn
where
poor
Le
Fever
died
,
not
yet
built
;
my
uncle
Toby
was
constrained
to
accept
of
a
bed
at
Mrs.
Wadman
's
,
for
a
night
or
two
,
till
corporal
Trim
(
who
to

character
of
an
excellent
valet

groom
,
cook
,
sempster

surgeon
,
and

super

added
that
of
an
excellent
upholsterer
too

,
with
the
help
of
a
carpenter
and
a
couple
of
taylors
,
constructed
one
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
house
.
  
<EOS>
A
daughter
of
Eve
,
for
such
was
widow
Wadman
,
and
'
tis
all
the
character
I
intend
to
give
of
her
      
"
<EOS>
That
she
was
a
perfect
woman
 
"
had
better
be
fifty
leagues
off
 
or
in
her
warm
bed
 
or
playing
with
a
case
-
knife
 
or
any
thing
you
please
 
than
make
a
man
<EOS>
the
object
of
her
attention
,
when
the
house
and
all
the
furniture
is
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
in
it
out
of
doors
and
in
broad
day
-
light
,
where
a
woman
has
a
power
,
physically
speaking
,
of
viewing
a
man
in
more
lights
than
one
 
<EOS>
but
here
,
for
her
soul
,
she
can
see
him
in
no
light
without
mixing
something
of
her
own
goods
and
chattels
along
with
him
 
till
by
reiterated
acts
of
such
combination
,
he
gets
foisted
into
her
inventory
      
<EOS>
And
then
good
night

<EOS>
But
this
is
not
matter
of
System

for
I
have
delivered
that
above

is
it
matter
of
Breviary
 
for
I
make
no
man

creed
but
<EOS>
my
own
 
nor
matter
of
Fact
 
at

that
I
know
of

but
'
tis
matter
copulative
and
introductory
to
what
follows

<EOS>
I
do
not
speak
it
with
regard
to
the
coarseness
or
cleanness
of
them
 
or
the
strength
of
their
gussets
 
but
pray
do
not
night
-
shifts
differ
from
day
-
shifts
as
much
in
this
particular
,
as
in
any
thing
else
in
the
world
;
that
they
so
far
exceed
the
others
in
length
,
that
when
you
are
laid
down
in
them
,
they
fall
almost
as
much
below
the
feet
,
as
the
day

shifts
fall
short
of
them

<EOS>
Widow
Wadman

night

shifts
<EOS>
(
as
was
the
mode
I
suppose
in
King
William

and
Queen
Anne

reigns
)
<EOS>
were
cut
however
after
this
fashion
;
and
if
the
fashion
is
changed
(
for
in
Italy
they
are
come
to
nothing
)
 
<EOS>
so
much
the
worse
for
the
public
;
they
were
two
Flemish
ells
and
a
half
in
length
,
so
that
allowing
a
moderate
woman
two
ells
,
she
had
half
an
ell
to
spare

to
do
what
she
would
with

Now
from
one
little
indulgence
gained
after
another
,
in
the
many
bleak

decemberley
nights

seven

hood

things
had
insensibly
come
to
this
pass

for

years
had
got
<EOS>
establish'd
<EOS>
into
one
of
the
ordinances
of
the
bed

chamber
 
<EOS>
That
as
soon
as
Mrs.
Wadman
was
put
to
bed
,
and
had
got
her
legs
stretched
down
to
the
bottom
of
it

of
which
she
always
gave
Bridget
notice
 
<EOS>
Bridget
,
with
all
suitable
decorum
,
having
first
open'd
<EOS>
the
bed

clothes

took
hold

with
both

drawn

downwards
to
its
furthest
extension
,
and
then
contracted
it
again
<EOS>
side-
long
by
four
or
five
even
plaits
<EOS>
,
she
took
a
large
corking
-
pin
out
of
her
sleeve
,
and
with
the
point
directed
towards
her
,
pinn'd
<EOS>
the
plaits
all
fast
together
a
little
above
the
hem
;
which
done
,
she
<EOS>
tuck'd
<EOS>
all
in
tight
at
the
feet
,
and
wish'd
her
mistress
a
good
night
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
constant
,
and
without
any
other
variation
than
this
;
that
on
shivering
and
tempestuous
nights
,
when
Bridget
<EOS>
untuck'd
<EOS>
the
feet
of
the
bed
,
&
c.
to
do
this
 
she
consulted
no
thermometer
but
that
of
her
own
passions
;
and
so
performed
it
standing
 
kneeling
 
or
squatting
,
according
to
the
different
degrees
of
faith
,
hope
,
and
charity
,
she
was
in
,
and
bore
towards
her
mistress
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
In
every
other
respect
,
the
etiquette
was
sacred
,
and
might
have
vied
with
the
most
mechanical
one
of
the
most
inflexible
bed
-
chamber
in
Christendom
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
night
,
as
soon
as
the
corporal
had
conducted
my
uncle
Toby
up
stairs
,
which
was
about
ten
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wadman
threw
herself
into
her
arm
-
chair
,
and
crossing
her
left
knee
with
her
right
,
which
formed
a
resting
-
place
for
her
elbow
,
she
reclin'd
<EOS>
her
cheek
upon
the
palm
of
her
hand
,
and
leaning
forwards
,
ruminated
till
midnight
upon
both
sides
of
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
The
second
night
she
went
to
her
bureau
,
and
having
ordered
Bridget
to
bring
her
up
a
couple
of
fresh
candles
and
leave
them
upon
the
table
,
she
took
out
her
marriage
-
settlement
,
and
read
it
over
with
great
devotion
:
 
and
the
third
night
(
which
was
the
last
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
stay
)
when
Bridget
had
pull'd
down
the
night
-
shift
,
and
was
assaying
to
stick
in
the
corking
pin
      
<EOS>
With
a
kick
of
both
heels
at
once
,
but
at
the
same
time
the
most
natural
kick
that
could
be
kick'd
<EOS>
in
her
situation
 
for
supposing
.........
to
be
the
sun
in
its
meridian
,
it
was
a
north
-
east
kick
 
<EOS>
she
kick'd
<EOS>
the
pin
out
of
her
fingers
 
the
etiquette
which
hung
upon
it
,
down
 
down
<EOS>
it
fell
to
the
ground
,
and
was
shiver'd
into
a
thousand
atoms
.
  
<EOS>
From
all
which
it
was
plain
that
widow
Wadman
was
in
love
with
my
uncle
Toby
.
    
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
's
head
at
that
time
was
full
of
other
matters
,
so
that
it
was
not
till
the
demolition
of
Dunkirk
,
when
all
the
other
civilities
of
Europe
were
settled
,
that
he
found
leisure
to
return
this
.
  
<EOS>
This
made
an
armistice
(
that
is
,
speaking
with
regard
to
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
 
<EOS>
but
with
respect
to
Mrs.
Wadman
,
a
vacancy
)
 
of
almost
eleven
years
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
all
cases
of
this
nature
,
as
it
is
the
second
blow
,
happen
at
what
distance
of
time
it
will
,
which
makes
the
fray
 
<EOS>
I
chuse
for
that
reason
to
call
these
the
amours
of
my
uncle
Toby
with
Mrs.
Wadman
,
rather
than
the
amours
of
Mrs.
Wadman
with
my
uncle
Toby
.
  
<EOS>
This
is
not
a
distinction
without
a
difference
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
not
like
the
affair
of
an
old
hat
<EOS>
cock'd
 
and
a
cock'd
old
hat
,
about
which
your
reverences
have
so
often
been
at
odds
with
one
another
 
<EOS>
but
there
is
a
difference
here
in
the
nature
of
things
    
<EOS>
And
let
me
tell
you
,
gentry
,
a
wide
one
too
.
    
<EOS>
Now
as
widow
Wadman
did
love
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
 
and
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
did
not
love
widow
Wadman
,
there
was
nothing
for
widow
Wadman
to
do
,
but
to
go
on
and
love
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
 
or
let
it
alone
.
  
<EOS>
Widow
Wadman
would
do
neither
the
one
or
the
other
.
    
<EOS>
Gracious
heaven
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
forget
I
am
a
little
of
her
temper
myself
;
for
whenever
it
so
falls
out
,
which
it
sometimes
does
about
the
equinoxes
,
that
an
earthly
goddess
is
so
much
this
,
and
that
,
and
t'other
,
that
I
can
not
eat
my
breakfast
for
her
 
and
that
she
careth
not
three
halfpence
whether
I
eat
my
breakfast
or
no
      
Curse
on
her
!
<EOS>
and
so
I
send
her
to
Tartary
,
and
from
Tartary
to
Terra
del
Fuogo
,
and
so
on
to
the
devil
:
 
in
short
,
there
is
not
an
infernal
nitch
where
I
do
not
take
her
divinityship
and
stick
it
.
  
<EOS>
But
as
the
heart
is
tender
,
and
the
passions
in
these
tides
ebb
and
flow
ten
times
in
a
minute
,
I
instantly
bring
her
back
again
;
and
as
I
do
all
things
in
extremes
,
I
place
her
in
the
very
center
of
the
milky
-
way
    
Brightest
of
stars
!
<EOS>
thou
wilt
shed
thy
influence
upon
some
one
      
<EOS>
The
duce
take
her
and
her
influence
too
 
for
at
that
word
<EOS>
I
lose
all
patience
 
much
good
<EOS>
may
it
do
him
!
 
<EOS>
By
all
that
is
hirsute
and
gashly
!
<EOS>
I
cry
,
taking
off
my
furr'd
cap
,
and
twisting
it
<EOS>
round
my
finger
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
give
sixpence
for
a
dozen
such
!
    
<EOS>
But
'
tis
an
excellent
cap
too
(
putting
it
upon
my
head
,
and
pressing
it
close
to
my
ears
)
 
and
warm
 
and
soft
;
especially
if
you
stroke
it
the
right
way
 
<EOS>
but
alas
!
<EOS>
that
will
never
be
my
luck
 
<EOS>
(
so
here
my
philosophy
is
shipwreck'd
again
.
)
    
<EOS>
No
<EOS>
;
I
shall
never
have
a
finger
in
the
pye

so
here
I
break
my
metaphor
)
    
Crust

Crumb
Inside

<EOS>

<EOS>
I
detest

I

I

I
'm
sick

cried

<EOS>
O

replied
I

so
went
on
with
the

<EOS>
"
Not

"
did
I
say
    
Lord
,
how
I
have
heated
my
imagination
with
this
metaphor
!
    
<EOS>
Which
shews
,
let
your
reverences

worships
say
what
you

it
(
for
as
for
thinking
 
all
who
do
think
 
think
pretty
much
alike
both
upon

and
other
matters

<EOS>

But
in
short
'
tis
of
such
a
nature
,
as
my
father
once
told
my
uncle
Toby
upon
the
close
of
a
long
dissertation
upon
the
subject
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
scarce
,
"
said
he
,
"
combine
two
ideas
together
upon
it
,
brother
Toby
,
without
an
hypallage
"
  
<EOS>
What
's
that
?
<EOS>
cried
my
uncle
Toby
.
  
<EOS>
The
cart
before
the
horse
,
replied
my
father
      
<EOS>
And
what
is
he
to
do
there
?
<EOS>
cried
my
uncle
Toby
.
  
<EOS>
Nothing
,
quoth
my
father
,
but
to
get
in
 
or
let
it
alone
.
  
<EOS>
Now
widow
Wadman
,
as
I
told
you
before
,
would
do
neither
the
one
or
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
She
stood
however
ready
harnessed
and
caparisoned
at
all
points
,
to
watch
accidents
.
    
<EOS>
The
Fates
,
who
certainly
all
fore
-
knew
of
these
amours
of
widow
Wadman
and
my
uncle
Toby
,
had
,
from
the
first
creation
of
matter
and
motion
(
and
with
more
courtesy
than
they
usually
do
things
of
this
kind
)
,
established
such
a
chain
of
causes
and
effects
hanging
so
fast
to
one
another
,
that
it
was
scarce
possible
for
my
uncle
Toby
to
have
dwelt
in
any
other
house
in
the
world
,
or
to
have
occupied
any
other
garden
in
Christendom
,
but
the
very
house
and
garden
which
join'd
and
laid
parallel
to
Mrs.
Wadman
's
;
this
,
with
the
advantage
of
a
thickset
arbour
in
Mrs.
Wadman
's
garden
,
but
planted
in
the
hedge
-
row
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
,
put
all
the
occasions
into
her
hands
which
Love
-
militancy
wanted
;
she
could
observe
my
uncle
Toby
's
motions
,
and
was
mistress
likewise
of
his
councils
of
war
;
and
as
his
unsuspecting
heart
had
given
leave
to
the
corporal
,
through
the
mediation
of
Bridget
,
to
make
her
a
wicker
-
gate
of
communication
to
enlarge
her
walks
,
it
enabled
her
to
carry
on
her
approaches
to
the
very
door
of
the
sentry
-
box
;
and
sometimes
out
of
gratitude
,
to
make
an
attack
,
and
endeavour
to
blow
my
uncle
Toby
up
in
the
very
sentry
-
box
itself
.
    
<EOS>
It
is
a
great
pity
 
<EOS>
but
'
tis
<EOS>
certain
from
every
day
's
observation
of
man
,
that
he
may
be
set
on
fire
like
a
candle
,
at
either
end
 
<EOS>
provided
<EOS>
there
is
a
sufficient
wick
standing
out
;
if
there
is
not
 
there
's
an
end
of
the
affair
;
and
if
there
is
 
by
lighting
it
at
the
bottom
,
as
the
flame
in
that
case
has
the
misfortune
generally
to
put
out
itself
 
there
's
an
end
of
the
affair
again
.
  
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
could
I
always
have
the
ordering
of
it
which
way
I
would
be
burnt
myself
 
for
I
can
not
bear
the
thoughts
of
being
burnt
like
a
beast
 
<EOS>
I
would
oblige
a
housewife
constantly
to
light
me
at
the
top
;
for
then
I
should
burn
down
decently
to
the
socket
;
that
is
,
from
my
head
to
my
heart
,
from
my
heart
to
my
liver
,
from
my
liver
to
my
bowels
,
and
so
on
by
the
meseraick
veins
and
arteries
,
through
all
the
turns
and
lateral
insertions
of
the
intestines
and
their
tunicles
to
the
blind
gut
      
<EOS>
I
beseech
you
,
doctor
Slop
,
<EOS>
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
interrupting
him
as
he
mentioned
the
blind
gut
,
in
a
discourse
with
my
father
the
night
my
mother
was
brought
to
bed
of
me
 
<EOS>
I
beseech
you
,
<EOS>
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
to
tell
me
which
is
the
blind
gut
;
for
,
old
as
I
am
,
I
vow
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
to
this
day
where
it
lies
.
  
<EOS>
The
blind
gut
,
answered
doctor
Slop
,
lies
betwixt
the
Ilion
and
Colon
    
<EOS>
In
a
man
?
<EOS>
said
my
father
.
    
<EOS>
'
Tis
precisely
the
same
,
cried
doctor
Slop
,
in
a
woman
.
    
<EOS>
That
's
more
than
I
know
;
quoth
my
father
.
      
<EOS>
And
so
to
make
sure
of
both
systems
,
Mrs.
Wadman
predetermined
to
light
my
uncle
Toby
neither
at
this
end
or
that
;
but
,
like
a
prodigal
's
candle
,
to
light
him
,
if
possible
,
at
both
ends
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
through
all
the
lumber
rooms
of
military
furniture
,
including
both
of
horse
and
foot
,
from
the
great
arsenal
of
Venice
to
the
Tower
of
London
(
exclusive
)
,
if
Mrs.
Wadman
had
been
rummaging
for
seven
years
together
,
and
with
Bridget
to
help
her
,
she
could
not
have
found
any
one
blind
or
mantelet
so
fit
for
her
purpose
,
as
that
which
the
expediency
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
affairs
had
fix'd
up
ready
to
her
hands
.
  
<EOS>
I
believe
I
have
not
told
you
 
<EOS>
but
I
do
n't
know
 
<EOS>
possibly
I
have
 
be
it
as
it
will
,
'
tis
one
of
the
number
of
those
many
things
,
which
a
man
had
better
do
over
again
,
than
dispute
about
it
 
<EOS>
That
whatever
town
or
fortress
the
corporal
was
at
work
upon
,
during
the
course
of
their
campaign
,
my
uncle
Toby
always
took
care
,
on
the
inside
of
his
sentry
-
box
,
which
was
towards
his
left
hand
,
to
have
a
plan
of
the
place
,
<EOS>
fasten'd
up
with
two
or
three
pins
at
the
top
,
but
loose
at
the
bottom
,
for
the
conveniency
of
holding
it
up
to
the
eye
,
&
c.
.
<EOS>
.as
<EOS>
occasions
required
;
so
that
when
an
attack
was
resolved
upon
,
Mrs.
Wadman
had
nothing
more
to
do
,
when
she
had
got
advanced
to
the
door
of
the
sentry
-
box
,
but
to
extend
her
right
hand
;
and
edging
in
her
left
foot
at
the
same
movement
,
to
take
hold
of
the
map
or
plan
,
or
upright
,
or
whatever
it
was
,
and
with
out
-
stretched
neck
meeting
it
<EOS>
half
way
,
 
to
advance
it
towards
her
<EOS>
;
on
which
my
uncle
Toby
's
passions
were
sure
to
catch
fire
 
for
he
would
instantly
take
hold
of
the
other
corner
of
the
map
in
his
left
hand
,
and
with
the
end
of
his
pipe
in
the
other
,
begin
an
explanation
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
attack
was
advanced
to
this
point
;
 
the
world
will
naturally
enter
into
the
reasons
of
Mrs.
Wadman
's
next
stroke
of
generalship
 
which
was
,
to
take
my
uncle
Toby
's
tobacco
-
pipe
out
of
his
hand
as
soon
as
she
possibly
could
;
which
,
under
one
pretence
or
other
,
but
generally
that
of
pointing
more
distinctly
at
some
redoubt
or
breastwork
in
the
map
,
she
would
effect
before
my
uncle
Toby
(
poor
soul
!
)
<EOS>
had
well
<EOS>
march'd
above
half
a
dozen
toises
with
it
.
    
<EOS>
It
obliged
my
uncle
Toby
to
make
use
of
his
forefinger
.
  
<EOS>
The
difference
it
made
in
the
attack
was
this
;
That
in
going
upon
it
,
as
in
the
first
case
,
with
the
end
of
her
fore
-
finger
against
the
end
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
tobacco
-
pipe
,
she
might
have
travelled
with
it
,
along
the
lines
,
from
Dan
to
Beersheba
,
had
my
uncle
Toby
's
lines
<EOS>
reach'd
<EOS>
so
far
,
without
any
effect
:
 
For
as
there
was
no
arterial
or
vital
heat
in
the
end
of
the
tobacco
-
pipe
,
it
could
excite
no
sentiment
 
<EOS>
it
could
neither
give
fire
by
pulsation
 
or
receive
it
by
sympathy
 
<EOS>
'
twas
nothing
but
smoke
.
  
<EOS>
Whereas
,
in
following
my
uncle
Toby
's
forefinger
with
hers
,
close
thro
'
all
the
little
turns
and
indentings
of
his
works
 
pressing
sometimes
against
the
side
of
it
 
then
treading
upon
its
nail
 
then
tripping
it
up
 
then
touching
it
here
 
then
there
,
<EOS>
and
so
on
 
it
set
something
at
least
in
motion
.
  
<EOS>
This
,
tho
'
slight
skirmishing
,
and
at
a
distance
from
the
main
body
,
yet
drew
on
the
rest
;
for
here
,
the
map
usually
falling
with
the
back
of
it
,
close
to
the
side
of
the
sentry
-
box
,
my
uncle
Toby
,
in
the
simplicity
of
his
soul
,
would
lay
his
hand
flat
upon
it
,
in
order
to
go
on
with
his
explanation
;
and
Mrs.
Wadman
,
by
a
manoeuvre
as
quick
as
thought
,
would
as
certainly
place
her
's
close
beside
it
;
this
at
once
opened
a
communication
,
large
enough
for
any
sentiment
to
pass
or
re
-
pass
,
which
a
person
skill'd
in
the
elementary
and
practical
part
of
love
-
making
,
has
occasion
for
    
<EOS>
By
bringing
up
her
forefinger
parallel
(
as
before
)
to
my
uncle
Toby
's
 
it
unavoidably
brought
the
thumb
into
action
 
and
the
forefinger
and
thumb
being
once
engaged
,
as
naturally
brought
in
the
whole
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Thine
,
dear
uncle
Toby
!
<EOS>
was
never
now
in
"
ts
right
place
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wadman
had
it
ever
to
take
up
,
or
,
with
the
gentlest
pushings
,
protrusions
,
and
equivocal
compressions
,
that
a
hand
to
be
removed
is
capable
of
receiving
 
to
get
it
<EOS>
press'd
<EOS>
a
hair
breadth
of
one
side
out
of
her
way
.
  
<EOS>
Whilst
this
was
doing
,
how
could
she
forget
to
make
him
sensible
,
that
it
was
her
leg
(
and
no
one
's
else
)
at
the
bottom
of
the
sentry
-
box
,
which
slightly
press'd
against
the
calf
of
his
 
So
that
my
uncle
Toby
being
thus
attack'd
and
sore
push'd
on
both
his
wings
 
was
it
a
wonder
,
if
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
it
put
his
centre
into
disorder
?
      
<EOS>
The
duce
take
it
!
<EOS>
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
    
<EOS>
These
attacks
of
Mrs.
Wadman
,
you
will
readily
conceive
to
be
of
different
kinds
;
varying
from
each
other
,
like
the
attacks
which
history
is
full
of
,
and
from
the
same
reasons
.
 
<EOS>
A
general
looker
-
on
would
scarce
allow
them
to
be
attacks
at
all
 
<EOS>
or
if
he
did
,
would
confound
them
all
together
 
<EOS>
but
I
write
not
to
them
:
 
it
will
be
time
enough
to
be
a
little
more
exact
in
my
descriptions
of
them
,
as
I
come
up
to
them
,
which
will
not
be
for
some
chapters
;
having
nothing
more
to
add
in
this
,
but
that
in
a
bundle
of
original
papers
and
drawings
which
my
father
took
care
to
roll
up
by
themselves
,
there
is
a
plan
of
Bouchain
in
perfect
preservation
(
and
shall
be
kept
so
,
whilst
I
have
power
to
preserve
any
thing
)
,
upon
the
lower
corner
of
which
,
<EOS>
on
the
right
hand
side
,
there
is
still
remaining
the
marks
of
a
snuffy
finger
and
thumb
,
which
there
is
all
the
reason
in
the
world
to
imagine
,
were
Mrs.
Wadman
's
;
for
the
opposite
side
of
the
margin
,
which
I
suppose
to
have
been
my
uncle
Toby
's
,
is
absolutely
clean
:
 
<EOS>
This
seems
an
authenticated
record
of
one
of
these
attacks
;
for
there
are
vestigia
of
the
two
punctures
partly
grown
up
,
but
still
visible
on
the
opposite
corner
of
the
map
,
which
are
unquestionably
the
very
holes
,
through
which
it
has
been
pricked
up
in
the
sentry
-
box
    
By
all
that
is
priestly
!
<EOS>
I
value
this
precious
relick
,
with
its
stigmata
and
pricks
,
more
than
all
the
relicks
of
the
Romish
church
 
always
excepting
,
when
I
am
writing
upon
these
matters
,
the
pricks
which
entered
the
flesh
of
St.
Radagunda
in
the
desert
,
which
in
your
road
from
Fesse
to
Cluny
,
the
nuns
of
that
name
will
shew
you
for
love
.
    
<EOS>
I
think
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
quoth
Trim
,
the
fortifications
are
quite
destroyed
 
and
the
bason
is
upon
a
level
with
the
mole
 
<EOS>
I
think
so
too
;
replied
my
uncle
Toby
with
a
sigh
half
suppress'd
 
but
step
into
the
parlour
,
Trim
,
for
the
stipulation
 
<EOS>
it
lies
upon
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
It
has
lain
there
these
six
weeks
,
replied
the
corporal
,
till
this
very
morning
that
the
old
woman
kindled
the
fire
with
it
      
Then
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
<EOS>
,
there
is
no
further
occasion
for
our
services
.
 
<EOS>
The
more
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
the
pity
,
said
the
corporal
;
in
uttering
which
he
cast
his
spade
into
the
wheel
-
barrow
,
which
was
beside
him
,
with
an
air
the
most
expressive
of
disconsolation
that
can
be
imagined
,
and
was
heavily
turning
about
to
look
for
his
pickax
,
his
pioneer
's
shovel
,
his
picquets
,
and
other
little
military
stores
,
in
order
to
carry
them
off
the
field
 
when
a
heigh
-
ho
!
<EOS>
from
the
sentry
-
box
,
which
being
made
of
thin
slit
deal
,
reverberated
the
sound
more
sorrowfully
to
his
ear
,
forbad
him
.
    
<EOS>
No
<EOS>
;
said
the
corporal
to
himself
,
I
'll
do
it
before
his
honour
rises
to-
<EOS>
morrow
morning
;
so
taking
his
spade
out
of
the
wheel
-
barrow
again
,
with
a
little
earth
in
it
,
as
if
to
level
something
at
the
foot
of
the
glacis
 
but
with
a
real
intent
to
approach
nearer
to
his
master
,
in
order
to
divert
him
 
he
loosen'd
<EOS>
a
sod
or
two
 
pared
their
edges
with
his
spade
,
and
having
given
them
a
gentle
blow
or
two
with
the
back
of
it
,
he
sat
himself
down
close
by
my
uncle
Toby
's
feet
and
began
as
follows
.
    
<EOS>
It
was
a
thousand
pities
 
<EOS>
though
I
believe
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
I
am
going
to
say
but
a
foolish
kind
of
a
thing
for
a
soldier
    
<EOS>
A
soldier
,
cried
my
uncle
Toby
,
interrupting
the
corporal
,
is
no
more
exempt
from
saying
a
foolish
thing
,
Trim
,
than
a
man
of
letters
 
<EOS>
But
not
so
often
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
replied
the
corporal
 
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
gave
a
nod
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
thousand
pities
then
,
said
the
corporal
,
casting
his
eye
upon
Dunkirk
,
and
the
mole
,
as
Servius
Sulpicius
,
in
returning
out
of
Asia
(
when
he
sailed
from
Aegina
towards
Megara
)
,
did
upon
Corinth
and
Pyreus
      
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
thousand
pities
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
to
destroy
these
works
 
and
a
thousand
pities
to
have
let
them
stood
.
"
      
<EOS>
Thou
art
<EOS>
right
,
Trim
,
in
both
cases
;
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
continued
the
corporal
,
is
the
reason
,
that
from
the
beginning
of
their
demolition
to
the
end
 
I
have
never
once
whistled
,
or
sung
,
or
laugh'd
,
or
cry'd
,
or
talk'd
of
past
done
deeds
,
or
told
your
honour
one
story
good
or
bad
      
<EOS>
Thou
hast
many
excellencies
<EOS>
,
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
and
I
hold
it
not
the
least
of
them
,
as
thou
happenest
to
be
a
story
-
teller
,
that
of
the
number
thou
hast
told
me
,
either
to
amuse
me
in
my
painful
hours
,
or
divert
me
in
my
grave
ones
 
<EOS>
thou
hast
seldom
told
me
a
bad
one
      
<EOS>
Because
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
except
one
of
a
King
of
Bohemia
and
his
seven
castles
,
 
they
are
all
true
;
for
they
are
about
myself
    
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
the
subject
the
worse
,
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
on
that
score
:
 
<EOS>
But
prithee
<EOS>
what
is
this
story
?
<EOS>
thou
hast
excited
my
curiosity
.
  
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
it
your
honour
,
quoth
<EOS>
the
corporal
,
directly
 
Provided
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
looking
earnestly
towards
Dunkirk
and
the
mole
again
 
<EOS>
provided
it
is
not
a
merry
one
;
to
such
,
Trim
,
a
man
should
ever
bring
one
half
of
the
entertainment
along
with
him
;
and
the
disposition
I
am
in
at
present
would
wrong
both
thee
,
Trim
,
and
thy
story
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
a
merry
one
by
any
means
,
replied
the
corporal
 
<EOS>
Nor
would
I
have
it
altogether
a
grave
one
,
added
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
 
<EOS>
It
is
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
,
replied
the
corporal
,
but
will
suit
your
honour
exactly
 
<EOS>
Then
I
'll
thank
thee
for
it
with
all
my
heart
,
cried
my
uncle
Toby
;
so
prithee
begin
it
,
Trim
.
  
<EOS>
The
corporal
made
his
reverence
;
and
though
it
is
not
so
easy
a
matter
as
the
world
imagines
,
to
pull
off
a
lank
Montero
-
cap
with
grace
 
or
a
whit
less
difficult
,
in
my
conceptions
,
when
a
man
is
sitting
squat
upon
the
ground
,
to
make
a
bow
so
teeming
with
respect
as
the
corporal
was
wo
nt
;
yet
by
suffering
the
palm
of
his
right
hand
,
which
was
towards
his
master
,
to
slip
backwards
upon
the
grass
,
a
little
beyond
his
body
,
in
order
to
allow
it
the
greater
sweep
 
and
by
an
unforced
compression
,
at
the
same
time
,
of
his
cap
with
the
thumb
and
the
two
forefingers
of
his
left
,
by
which
the
diameter
of
the
cap
became
reduced
,
so
that
it
might
be
said
,
rather
to
be
insensibly
squeez'd
 
<EOS>
than
<EOS>
pull'd
off
with
a
flatus
 
<EOS>
the
corporal
acquitted
himself
of
both
in
a
better
manner
than
the
posture
of
his
affairs
promised
;
and
having
hemmed
twice
,
to
find
in
what
key
his
story
would
best
go
,
and
best
suit
his
master
's
humour
,
 
he
exchanged
a
single
look
of
kindness
with
him
,
and
set
off
thus

The
Story
of
the

he-
  
<EOS>
As
the
corporal
was
entering
the
confines
of
Bohemia
,
my
uncle
Toby
obliged
him
to
halt
for
a
single
moment
;
he
had
set
out
bare
-
headed
,
having
,
since
he
pull'd
off
his
Montero
-
cap
in
the
latter
end
of
the
last
chapter
,
left
it
lying
beside
him
on
the
ground
.
    
<EOS>
The
eye
of
Goodness
espieth
all
things
 
so
that
before
the
corporal
had
well
got
through
the
first
five
words
of
his
story
,
had
my
uncle
Toby
twice
touch'd
<EOS>
his
Montero
-
cap
with
the
end
of
his
cane
,
interrogatively
 
as
much
as
to
say
,
Why
do
n't
you
put
it
on
,
Trim
?
<EOS>
Trim
took
it
up
with
the
most
respectful
slowness
,
and
casting
a
glance
of
humiliation
as
he
did
it
,
upon
the
embroidery
of
the
fore
-
part
,
which
being
dismally
tarnish'd
and
fray'd
<EOS>
moreover
in
some
of
the
principal
leaves
and
boldest
parts
of
the
pattern
,
he
lay'd
it
down
again
between
his
two
feet
,
in
order
to
moralize
upon
the
subject
.
    
<EOS>
'
<EOS>
Tis
<EOS>
every
word
of
it
but
too
true
,
cried
my
uncle
Toby
,
that
thou
art
about
to
observe
    
<EOS>
"
Nothing
in
this
world
,
Trim
,
is
made
to
last
for
ever
.
"
    
<EOS>
But
when
tokens
,
dear
Tom
,
of
thy
love
and
remembrance
wear
out
,
said
Trim
,
what
shall
we
say
?
  
<EOS>
There
is
no
occasion
,
Trim
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
to
say
any
thing
else
;
and
was
a
man
to
puzzle
his
brains
till
Doom
's
day
,
I
believe
,
Trim
,
it
would
be
impossible
.
  
<EOS>
The
corporal
,
perceiving
my
uncle
Toby
was
in
the
right
,
and
that
it
would
be
in
vain
for
the
wit
of
man
to
think
of
extracting
a
purer
moral
from
his
cap
,
without
further
attempting
it
,
he
put
it
on
;
and
passing
his
hand
across
his
forehead
to
rub
out
a
pensive
wrinkle
,
which
the
text
and
the
doctrine
between
them
had
engender'd
,
he
return'd
,
with
the
same
look
and
tone
of
voice
,
to
his
story
of
the
king
of
Bohemia
and
his

the

my

To

Trim

quoth
my

Toby
,
any

would
have
pleased
me
much
better
,
not
only
on
account
of
the
sad
stain
upon
our
history
that
year
,
in
marching
off
our
troops
,
and
refusing
to
cover
the
siege
of
Quesnoi
,
though
Fagel
was
carrying
on
the
works
with
such
incredible
vigour
 
but
likewise
on

Trim
,
of
thy

;
because
if
there

from

thou

him
back

of

said
my

<EOS>
but
with
accents
of
such
sweet
encouragement
did
he
utter
it

that
the

my

leaning

laying
his

gently
upon
the

shoulder
to
temper

said
the

won
by
the
manner
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
reasoning

as
much
as
by
the

Thou
would'st
have
said
chronology
,
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
;
for
as
for
geography
,
'
tis
of
absolute
use
to
him
;
he
must
be
acquainted
intimately
with
every
country
and
its
boundaries
where
his
profession
carries
him
;
he
should
know
every
town
and
city
,
and
village
and
hamlet
,
with
the
canals
,
the
roads
,
and
hollow
ways
which
lead
up
to
them
;
there
is
not
a
river
or
a
rivulet
he
passes
,
Trim
,
but
he
should
be
able
at
first
sight
to
tell
thee
what
is
its
name
 
<EOS>
in
what
mountains
it
takes
its
rise
 
<EOS>
what
is
its
course
  
how
far
it
is
navigable
 
<EOS>
where
fordable
 
where
not
;
he
should
know
the
fertility
of
every
valley
,
as
well
as
the
hind
who
ploughs
it
;
and
be
able
to
describe
,
or
,
if
it
is
required
,
to
give
thee
an
exact
map
of
all
the
plains
and
defiles
,
the
forts
,
the
acclivities
,
the
woods
and
morasses
,
thro

and
by
which
his
army
is
to

he

their

it

continued
my

Toby
,
rising
up
in
his
sentry
-
box
,
as
he
began
to
warm
in
this
part
of
his
discourse
 
<EOS>
how
Marlborough
could
have
marched
his
army
from
the
banks
of
the
Maes
to
Belburg
;
from
Belburg
to
Kerpenord
 
(
here
the
corporal
could
sit
no
longer
)
from
Kerpenord

Trim
,
to

from

from

from

to

from
Gingen
to
Balmerchoffen
;
from
Balmerchoffen
to
Skellenburg
,
where
he
broke
in
upon
the
enemy
's
works
;
forced
his
passage
over
the
Danube
;
cross'd
<EOS>
the
Lech
 
push'd
on
his
troops
into
the
heart
of
the

,
marching
at
the
head
of
them
through
Fribourg
,
Hokenwert
,
and
Schonevelt
,
to
the
plains
of
Blenheim
and
Hochstet

<EOS>
Great
as
he
was

corporal
,
he
could
not
have
advanced
a
step
,
or
made
one
single
day
's
march
without
the
aids
of
Geography
.
 
<EOS>
As
for
Chronology
,
I
own
,
Trim
,
continued
my
uncle
Toby
,
sitting
down
again
coolly
in
his
sentry
-
box
,
that
of
all
others
,
it
seems
a
science
which
the
soldier
might
best
spare
,
was
it
not
for
the
lights
which
that
science
must
one
day
give
him
,
in
determining
the
invention
of
powder
;
the
furious
execution
of
which
,
renversing
every
thing
like
thunder
before
it
,
has
become
a
new
aera
to
us
of
military
improvements
,
changing
so
totally
the
nature
of
attacks
and
defences
both
by
sea
and
land
,
and
awakening
so
much
art
and
skill
in
doing
it
,
that
the
world
can
not
be
too
exact
in
ascertaining
the
precise
time
of
its
discovery
,
or
too
inquisitive
in
knowing
what
great
man
was
the
discoverer
,
and
what
occasions
gave
birth
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
far
from
controverting
,
continued
my
uncle
Toby
,
what
historians
agree
in
,
that
in
the
year
of
our
Lord
1380
,
under
the
reign
of
Wencelaus
,
son
of
Charles
the
Fourth
 
<EOS>
a
certain
priest
,
whose
name
was
Schwartz
,
shew'd
<EOS>
the
use
of
powder
to
the
Venetians
,
in
their
wars
against
the
Genoese
;
but
'
tis
certain
he
was
not
the
first
;
because
if
we
are
to
believe
Don
Pedro
,
the
bishop
of
Leon
 
<EOS>
How
came
priests
and
bishops
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
to
trouble
their
heads
so
much
about
gun
-
powder
?
 
<EOS>
God
knows
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
his
providence
brings
good
out
of
every
thing
 
and
he
avers
,
in
his
chronicle
of
King
Alphonsus
,
who
reduced
Toledo
,
That
in
the
year
1343
,
which
was
full
thirty
-
seven
years
before
that
time
,
the
secret
of
powder
was
well
known
,
and
employed
with
success
,
both
by
Moors
and
Christians
,
not
only
in
their
sea
-
combats
,
at
that
period
,
but
in
many
of
their
most
memorable
sieges
in
Spain
and
Barbary
 
And
all
the
world
knows
,
that
Friar
Bacon
had
wrote
expressly
about
it
,
and
had
generously
given
the
world
a
receipt
to
make
it
by
,
above
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
before
even
Schwartz
was
born
 
And
that
the
Chinese
,
added
my
uncle
Toby
,
embarrass
us
,
and
all
accounts
of
it
,
still
more

boasting
of
the
invention

some
hundreds
of

even
before
him

They
are
a
pack
of
liars
<EOS>

I
believe
,
cried
Trim
      
<EOS>
They
are
somehow
or
other
deceived
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
in
this
matter
,
as
is
plain
to
me
from
the
present
miserable
state
of
military
architecture
amongst
them
;
which
consists
of
nothing
more
than
a
fosse
with
a
brick
wall
without
flanks
 
and
for
what
they
gave
us
as
a
bastion
at
each
angle
of
it
,
'
tis
so
barbarously
constructed
,
that
it
looks
for
all
the
world
 
<EOS>
Like
one
of

Trim

<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby

tho
'
in
the

distress
for

comparison
,
most
courteously
refused
Trim

offer

Trim
telling

he
had

more

Bohemia

he

<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
was
so
touch'd
<EOS>
with
the
pleasantry
of
heart
of
the
corporal
 
that
he
discontinued
his
dissertation
upon

Was

cried
my

Toby

for
he
had
been
so
wrapt
up
in

upon

powder
,
and
other
military
affairs
,
that
tho

he
had
desired
the

to
go
on
,
yet
the
many
interruptions
he
had
given
,
dwelt
not
so
strong
upon
his
fancy
as
to
account
for
the
epithet
 
<EOS>
Was
he
unfortunate
,
then
,
Trim

<EOS>
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
pathetically
 
<EOS>
The
corporal
,
wishing
first
the
word
and
all
its
synonimas
at
the
devil
<EOS>
,
forthwith
began
to
run
back
in
his
mind
,
the
principal
events
in
the
King
of
Bohemia
's
story
;
from
every
one
of
which
,
it
appearing
that
he
was
the
most
fortunate
man
that
ever
existed
in
the
world
 
<EOS>
it
put
the
corporal
to
a
stand
:
 
for
not
caring
to
retract
his
epithet
 
and
less
to
explain
it
 
and
least
of
all
,
to
twist
his
tale
(
like
men
of
lore
)
to
serve
a
system
 
<EOS>
he
looked
up
in
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
's
face
for
assistance
 
<EOS>
but
seeing
it
was
the
very
thing
my
uncle
Toby
sat
in
expectation
of
himself
 
after
a
hum
and
a
haw
,
he
went
on
    
The
King
of
Bohemia
,
an
'
please

replied
the
corporal
,
was
unfortunate
,
as
thus
 
That
taking
great
pleasure
and
delight
in
navigation
and
all

of

there
happening

How
the

Trim

<EOS>
cried
my
uncle
Toby
;
for
Bohemia
being
totally
inland
,
it
could
have
happen'd
<EOS>
no
otherwise
 
It
might

said
Trim
,
if
it
had
pleased
God
    
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
never
spoke
of
the
being
and
natural
attributes
of
God
,
but
with
diffidence
and
hesitation
      
I
believe
not
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
,
after
some
pause
 
for
being
inland
,
as
I
said
,
and
having
Silesia
and
Moravia
to
the
east
;
Lusatia
and
Upper
Saxony
to
the
north
;
Franconia
to
the
west
;
and
Bavaria
to
the
south
;
Bohemia
could
not
have
been
propell'd
to
the
sea
without
ceasing
to
be
Bohemia
 
nor
could
the
sea
,
on
the
other
hand
,
have
come
up
to
Bohemia
,
without
overflowing
a
great
part
of
Germany
,

destroying
millions
of
unfortunate
inhabitants
who
could
make
no

against
it
 
Scandalous
!
<EOS>
cried
Trim
 
<EOS>
Which
would
bespeak
,
added
my
uncle
Toby
,
mildly
,
such
a
want
of
compassion
in
him
who
is
the
father
of
it
 
<EOS>
that
,
I
think
,
Trim
 
the
thing
could
have
happen'd
no
way
.
  
<EOS>
The
corporal
made
the
bow
of
unfeign'd
conviction
;
and
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
Now
the
King
of
Bohemia

there
the

cried
my

for
the

say
to
his
soldiers
,
that
"
every
ball
had
its
billet
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
great
man
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
And
I
believe
,
continued
Trim
,
to
this
day
,
that
the
shot
which
disabled
me
at
the
battle
of
Landen
,
was
pointed
at
my
knee
for
no
other
purpose
,
but
to
take
me
out
of
his
service
,
and
place
me
in
your
honour
's
,
where
I
should
be
taken
so
much
better
care
of
in
my
old
age
 
It
shall
never
,
Trim
,
be
construed
otherwise
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
  
<EOS>
The
heart
,
both
of
the
master
and
the
man
,
were
alike
subject
to
sudden
over
-
flowings
;
 
a
short
silence
ensued
.
  
<EOS>
Besides
,
said
the
corporal
,
resuming
the
discourse
 
but
in
a
gayer
accent
  
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
single
shot
<EOS>
,
I
had
never
,
"
an
please
your
honour
,
been
in
love
    
<EOS>
So
,
thou
wast
once
in
love
,
Trim
!
<EOS>
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
smiling
    
Souse
!
<EOS>
replied
the
corporal
 
over
head
and
ears
!
<EOS>
an
'
please
your
honour
.
 
<EOS>
Prithee
<EOS>
when
?
<EOS>
where
?
 
<EOS>
and
how
came
it
to
pass
?
 
<EOS>
I
never
heard
one
word
of
it
before
;
quoth
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
:
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
,
answered
Trim
,
that
every
drummer
and
serjeant
's
son
in
the
regiment
knew
of
it
 
<EOS>
It
's
high
time
<EOS>
I
should
 
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
  
<EOS>
Your
honour
remembers
with
concern
,
said
the
corporal
,
the
total
rout
and
confusion
of
our
camp
and
army
at
the
affair
of
Landen
;
every
one
was
left
to
shift
for
himself
;
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
regiments
of
Wyndham
,
Lumley
,
and
Galway
,
which
covered
the
retreat
over
the
bridge
Neerspeeken
,
the
king
himself
could
scarce
have
gained
it
 
he
was
press'd
hard
,
as
your
honour
knows
,
on
every
side
of
him
    
Gallant
mortal
!
<EOS>
cried
my
uncle
Toby
,
caught
up
with
enthusiasm
 
this
moment
,
now
that
all
is
lost
,
I
see
him
galloping
across
me
,
corporal
,
to
the
left
,
to
bring
up
the
remains
of
the
English
horse
along
with
him
to
support
the
right
,
and
tear
the
laurel
from
Luxembourg
's
brows
,
if
yet
'
tis
possible
 
<EOS>
I
see
him
with
the
knot
of
his
scarfe
<EOS>
just
shot
off
,
infusing
fresh
spirits
into
poor
Galway
's
regiment
 
riding
along
the
line
 
then
wheeling
about
,
and
charging
Conti
at
the
head
of
it
 
Brave
,
brave
,
by
heaven
!
<EOS>
cried
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
he
deserves
a
crown
 
<EOS>
As
richly
,
as
a
thief
a
halter
;
shouted
Trim
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
knew
the
corporal
's
loyalty
;
 
otherwise
the
comparison
was
not
at
all
to
his
mind
 
<EOS>
it
did
not
altogether
strike
the
corporal
's
fancy
when
he
had
made
it
 
<EOS>
but
it
could
not
be
<EOS>
recall'd
 
<EOS>
so
he
had
nothing
to
do
,
but
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
number
of
wounded
was
prodigious
,
and
no
one
had
time
to
think
of
any
thing
but
his
own
safety
 
<EOS>
Though
Talmash
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
brought
off
the
foot
with
great
prudence
 
<EOS>
But
I
was
left
upon
the
field
,
said
the
corporal
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
wast
<EOS>
so
;
poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
replied
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
So
that
it
was
noon
the
next
day
,
continued
the
corporal
,
before
I
was
exchanged
,
and
put
into
a
cart
with
thirteen
or
fourteen
more
,
in
order
to
be
convey'd
to
our
hospital
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
no
part
of
the
body
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
where
a
wound
occasions
more
intolerable
anguish
than
upon
the
knee
    
<EOS>
Except
the
groin
;
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
An
'
please
your
honour
,
replied
the
corporal
,
<EOS>
the
knee
,
in
my
opinion
,
must
certainly
be
the
most
acute
,
there
being
so
many
tendons
and
what
-
d'ye
-
call-'ems
all
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
for
that
reason
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
that
the
groin
is
infinitely
more
sensible
 
there
being
not
only
as
many
tendons
and
what
-
d'ye
-
call-'ems
(
for
I
know
their
names
as
little
as
thou
dost
)
 
about
it
 
<EOS>
but
moreover
...
    
Mrs.
Wadman
,
who
had
been
all
the
time
in
her
arbour
 
instantly
stopp'd
<EOS>
her
breath
 
unpinn'd
her
mob
at
the
chin
,
and
stood
upon
one
leg
    
<EOS>
The
dispute
was
maintained
with
amicable
and
equal
force
betwixt
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
and
Trim
for
some
time
<EOS>
;
till
Trim
at
length
recollecting
that
he
had
often
cried
at
his
master
's
sufferings
,
but
never
shed
a
tear
at
his
own
  
was
for
giving
up
the
point
,
which
my
uncle
Toby
would
not
allow
 
'
Tis
a
proof
of
nothing
,
Trim
,
said
he
,
but
the
generosity
of
thy
temper
    
So
that
whether
the
pain
of
a
wound
in
the
groin
(
caeteris
paribus
)
is
greater
than
the
pain
of
a
wound
in
the
knee
 
or
  
Whether
the
pain
of
a
wound
in
the
knee
is
not
greater
than
the
pain
of
a
wound
in
the
groin
 
are
points
which
to
this
day
remain
unsettled
.
    
<EOS>
The
anguish
of
my
knee
,
continued
the
corporal
,
was
excessive
in
itself
;
and
the
uneasiness
of
the
cart
,
with
the
roughness
of
the
roads
,
which
were
terribly
cut
up
 
making
bad
still
worse
 
<EOS>
every
step
was
death
to
me
:
 
so
that
with
the
loss
of
blood
,
and
the
want
of
care
-
taking
of
me
,
and
a
fever
I
felt
coming
on
besides
 
(
Poor
soul
!
<EOS>
said
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
)
 
<EOS>
all
together
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
was
more
than
I
could
sustain
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
telling
my
sufferings
to
a
young
woman
at
a
peasant
's
house
,
where
our
cart
,
which
was
the
last
of
the
line
,
had
halted
;
they
had
help'd
me
in
,
and
the
young
woman
had
taken
a
cordial
out
of
her
pocket
and
dropp'd
<EOS>
it
upon
some
sugar
,
and
seeing
it
had
<EOS>
cheer'd
<EOS>
me
,
she
had
given
it
me
a
second
and
<EOS>
a
third
time
 
<EOS>
So
I
was
telling
her
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
the
anguish
I
was
in
,
and
was
saying
it
was
so
intolerable
to
me
,
that
I
had
much
rather
lie
down
upon
the
bed
,
turning
my
face
towards
one
which
was
in
the
corner
of
the
room
 
and
die
,
than
go
on
 
when
,
upon
her
attempting
to
lead
me
to
it
,
I
fainted
away
in
her
arms
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
a
good
soul
!
<EOS>
as
your
honour
,
said
the
corporal
,
wiping
his
eyes
,
will
hear
.
  
<EOS>
I
thought
love
had
been
a
joyous
thing
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
<EOS>
the
most
serious
thing
,
an
'
please
your
honour
(
sometimes
)
,
that
is
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
By
the
persuasion
of
the
young
woman
,
continued
the
corporal
,
the
cart
with
the
wounded
men
set
off
without
me
:
 
<EOS>
she
had
assured
them
I
should
expire
immediately
if
I
was
put
into
the
cart
.
 
<EOS>
So
when
I
came
to
myself
 
I
found
myself
in
a
still
quiet
cottage
,
with
no
one
but
the
young
woman
,
and
the
peasant
and
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
laid
across
the
bed
in
the
corner
of
the
room
,
with
my
wounded
leg
upon
a
chair
,
and
the
young
woman
beside
me
,
holding
the
corner
of
her
handkerchief
dipp'd
in
vinegar
to
my
nose
with
one
hand
,
and
rubbing
my
temples
with
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
I
took
her
at
first
for
the
daughter
of
the
peasant
(
for
it
was
no
inn
)
 
<EOS>
so
had
offer'd
<EOS>
her
a
little
purse
with
eighteen
florins
,
which
my
poor
brother
Tom
<EOS>
(
here
Trim
wip'd
his
eyes
)
had
sent
me
as
a
token
,
by
a
recruit
,
just
before
he
set
out
for
Lisbon
      
<EOS>
I
never
told
your
honour
that
piteous
story
yet
 
here
<EOS>
Trim
wiped
his
eyes
a
third
time
.
  
<EOS>
The
young
woman
call'd
the
old
man
and
his
wife
into
the
room
,
to
shew
them
the
money
,
in
order
to
gain
me
credit
for
a
bed
and
<EOS>
what
little
necessaries
I
should
want
,
till
I
should
be
in
a
condition
to
be
got
to
the
hospital
  
<EOS>
Come
then
!
<EOS>
said
she
,
tying
up
the
little
purse
 
<EOS>
I
'll
be
your
banker
 
<EOS>
but
as
that
office
alone
will
not
keep
me
employ'd
,
I
'll
be
your
nurse
too
.
  
<EOS>
I
thought
by
her
manner
of
speaking
this
,
as
well
as
by
her
dress
,
which
I
then
began
to
consider
more
attentively
 
that
the
young
woman
could
not
be
the
daughter
of
the
peasant
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
in
black
down
to
her
toes
,
with
<EOS>
her
hair
conceal'd
<EOS>
under
a
cambric
border
,
laid
close
to
her
forehead
:
 
<EOS>
she
was
one
of
those
kind
of
nuns
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
of
which
,
your
honour
knows
,
there
are
a
good
many
in
Flanders
,
which
they
let
go
loose
 
<EOS>
By
thy
description
,
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
she
was
a
young
Beguine
,
of
which
there
are
none
to
be
found
any
where
but
in
the
Spanish
Netherlands
 
except
at
Amsterdam
 
<EOS>
they
differ
from
nuns
in
this
,
that
they
can
quit
their
cloister
if
they
choose
to
marry
;
they
visit
and
take
care
of
the
sick
by
profession
 
<EOS>
I
had
rather
,
for
my
own
part
,
they
did
it
out
of
good
-
nature
.
    
<EOS>
She
often
told
me
,
quoth
Trim
,
she
did
it
for
the
love
of
Christ
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
like
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
,
Trim
,
we
are
both
wrong
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
we
'll
ask
Mr.
Yorick
about
it
to
-
night
at
my
brother
Shandy
's
 
<EOS>
so
put
me
in
mind
;
added
my
uncle
Toby
.
  
<EOS>
The
young
Beguine
,
continued
the
corporal
,
had
scarce
given
herself
time
to
tell
me
"
she
would
be
my
nurse
,
"
when
she
hastily
turned
about
to
begin
the
office
of
one
,
and
prepare
something
for
me
 
and
in
a
short
time
 
though
I
thought
it
a
long
one
 
<EOS>
she
came
back
with
flannels
,
&
c.
&
c.
and
having
fomented
my
knee
soundly
for
a
couple
of
hours
,
&
c.
and
made
me
a
thin
bason
of
gruel
for
my
supper
 
she
<EOS>
wish'd
me
rest
,
and
promised
to
be
with
me
early
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
She
<EOS>
wish'd
me
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
what
was
not
to
be
had
.
 
<EOS>
My
fever
ran
very
high
that
night
 
her
figure
made
sad
disturbance
within
me
 
<EOS>
I
was
every
moment
cutting
the
world
in
two
 
to
give
her
half
of
it
 
and
every
moment
was
I
crying
,
That
I
had
nothing
but
a
knapsack
and
eighteen
florins
to
share
with
her
 
<EOS>
The
whole
night
long
was
the
fair
Beguine
,
like
an
angel
,
close
by
my
bed
-
side
,
holding
back
my
curtain
and
offering
me
cordials
 
<EOS>
and
I
was
only
awakened
from
my
dream
by
her
coming
there
at
the
hour
promised
,
and
giving
them
in
reality
.
 
<EOS>
In
truth
,
she
was
scarce
ever
from
me
;
and
so
accustomed
was
I
to
receive
life
from
her
hands
,
that
my
heart
sickened
,
and
I
lost
colour
when
she
left
the
room
:
 
and
yet
,
continued
the
corporal
(
making
one
of
the
strangest
reflections
upon
it
in
the
world
)
    
<EOS>
"
It
was
not
love
"
 
for
during
the
three
weeks
she
was
almost
constantly
with
me
,
fomenting
my
knee
with
her
hand
,
night
and
day
 
<EOS>
I
can
honestly
say
,
an
'
please
your
honour
 
that
.
.
<EOS>
.once
.
  
<EOS>
That
was
very
odd
,
Trim
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
so
too
 
said
Mrs.
Wadman
.
  
<EOS>
It
never
did
,
said
the
corporal
.
      
<EOS>
But
'
tis
no
marvel
,
continued
the
corporal
 
seeing
my
uncle
Toby
musing
upon
it
 
for
Love
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
is
exactly
like
war
,
in
this
;
that
a
soldier
,
though
he
has
escaped
three
weeks
complete
o'Saturday
night
,
 
may
nevertheless
be
shot
through
his
heart
on
Sunday
morning
 
<EOS>
It
happened
so
here
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
with
this
difference
only
 
that
it
was
on
Sunday
in
the
afternoon
,
when
I
fell
in
love
all
at
once
with
a
sisserara
 
<EOS>
It
burst
upon
me
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
like
a
bomb
 
<EOS>
scarce
giving
me
time
to
say
,
"
God
bless
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
thought
,
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
a
man
never
fell
in
love
so
very
suddenly
.
  
<EOS>
Yes
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
if
he
is
in
the
way
of
it
 
replied
Trim
.
  
<EOS>
I
prithee
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
inform
me
how
this
matter
happened
.
    
<EOS>
With
all
pleasure
,
said
the
corporal
,
making
a
bow
.
    
<EOS>
I
had
escaped
,
continued
the
corporal
,
all
that
time
from
falling
in
love
,
and
had
gone
on
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
,
<EOS>
had
it
not
been
predestined
otherwise
 
<EOS>
there
is
no
resisting
our
fate
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
on
a
Sunday
,
in
the
afternoon
,
as
I
told
your
honour
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
man
and
his
wife
had
walked
out
    
<EOS>
Every
thing
was
still
and
hush
as
midnight
about
the
house
    
<EOS>
There
was
not
so
much
as
a
duck
or
a
duckling
about
the
yard
      
<EOS>
When
the
fair
Beguine
came
in
to
see
me
.
  
<EOS>
My
wound
was
then
in
a
fair
way
of
doing
well
 
<EOS>
the
inflammation
had
been
gone
off
for
some
time
,
but
it
was
succeeded
with
an
itching
both
above
and
below
my
knee
,
so
insufferable
,
that
I
had
not
shut
my
eyes
the
whole
night
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
Let
me
see
it
,
said
she
,
kneeling
down
upon
the
ground
parallel
to
my
knee
,
and
laying
her
hand
upon
the
part
below
it
 
<EOS>
it
only
wants
rubbing
a
little
,
said
the
Beguine
;
so
covering
it
with
the
bed
-
clothes
,
she
began
with
the
fore
-
finger
of
her
right
hand
to
rub
under
my
knee
,
guiding
her
fore
-
finger
backwards
and
forwards
by
the
edge
of
the
flannel
which
kept
on
the
dressing
.
  
<EOS>
In
five
or
six
minutes
I
felt
slightly
the
end
of
her
second
finger
 
<EOS>
and
presently
it
was
laid
flat
with
the
other
,
and
<EOS>
she
continued
rubbing
in
that
way
round
and
round
for
a
good
while
;
it
then
came
into
my
head
,
that
I
should
fall
in
love
 
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
blush'd
<EOS>
when
I
saw
how
white
a
hand
<EOS>
she
had
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
behold
another
hand
so
white
<EOS>
whilst
I
live
      
<EOS>
Not
in
that
place
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
    
<EOS>
Though
it
was
the
most
serious
despair
in
nature
to
the
corporal
 
<EOS>
he
could
not
forbear
smiling
.
  
<EOS>
The
young
Beguine
,
continued
the
corporal
,
perceiving
it
was
of
great
service
to
me
 
from
rubbing
for
some
time
,
with
two
fingers
 
proceeded
to
rub
at
length
,
with
three
 
till
by
little
and
little
she
brought
down
the
fourth
,
and
then
rubb'd
with
her
whole
hand
:
 
I
will
never
say
another
word
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
upon
hands
again
 
<EOS>
but
it
was
softer
than
sattin
      
Prithee
,
Trim
<EOS>
,
commend
it
as
much
as
thou
wilt
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
;
I
shall
hear
thy
story
with
the
more
delight
 
<EOS>
The
corporal
thank'd
<EOS>
his
master
most
unfeignedly
;
but
having
nothing
to
say
upon
the
Beguine
's
hand
but
the
same
over
again
 
<EOS>
he
proceeded
to
the
effects
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
fair
Beguine
,
said
the
corporal
,
continued
rubbing
with
her
whole
hand
under
my
knee
 
till
I
fear'd
<EOS>
her
zeal
would
weary
her
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
do
a
thousand
times
more
,
"
said
she
,
"
for
the
love
of
Christ
"
 
<EOS>
In
saying
which
,
she
pass'd
her
hand
across
the
flannel
,
to
the
part
above
my
knee
,
which
I
had
equally
complain'd
of
,
and
rubb'd
it
also
.
  
<EOS>
I
perceiv'd
,
then
,
I
was
beginning
to
be
in
love
    
<EOS>
As
she
continued
rub
-
rub
-
rubbing
 
I
felt
it
spread
from
under
her
hand
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
to
every
part
of
my
frame
    
<EOS>
The
more
<EOS>
she
rubb'd
,
and
the
longer
strokes
<EOS>
she
took
 
the
more
the
fire
kindled
in
my
veins
 
till
at
length
,
by
two
or
three
strokes
longer
than
the
rest
 
<EOS>
my
passion
rose
to
the
highest
pitch
 
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
seiz'd
her
hand
      
<EOS>
And
then
thou
clapped'st
it
to
thy
lips
,
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
 
and
madest
a
speech
.
  
<EOS>
Whether
the
corporal
's
amour
terminated
precisely
in
the
way
my
uncle
Toby
described
it
,
is
not
material
;
it
is
enough
that
it
contained
in
it
the
essence
of
all
the
love
romances
which
ever
have
been
wrote
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
.
    
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
corporal
had
finished
the
story
of
his
amour
 
or
rather
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
for
him
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wadman
silently
sallied
forth
from
her
arbour
,
replaced
the
pin
in
her
mob
,
pass'd
the
wicker
gate
,
and
advanced
slowly
towards
my
uncle
Toby
's
sentry
-
box
:
 
the
disposition
which
Trim
had
made
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
mind
,
was
too
favourable
a
crisis
to
be
let
slipp'd
      
<EOS>
The
attack
was
determin'd
upon
:
 
it
was
facilitated
still
more
by
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
's
having
ordered
the
corporal
to
wheel
off
the
pioneer
's
shovel
,
the
spade
,
the
pick
-
axe
,
the
picquets
,
and
other
military
stores
which
lay
scatter'd
upon
the
ground
where
Dunkirk
stood
 
The
corporal
had
<EOS>
march'd
  
<EOS>
the
field
was
clear
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
consider
,
sir
,
what
nonsense
it
is
,
either
in
fighting
,
or
writing
,
or
any
thing
else
(
whether
in
rhyme
to
it
,
or
not
)
which
a
man
has
occasion
to
do
 
to
act
by
plan
:
 
for
if
ever
Plan
,
independent
of
all
circumstances
,
deserved
registering
in
letters
of
gold
(
I
mean
in
the
archives
of
Gotham
)
 
<EOS>
it
was
certainly
the
Plan
of
Mrs.
Wadman
's
attack
of
my
uncle
Toby
in
his
sentry
-
box
,
By
Plan
 
<EOS>
Now
the
plan
hanging
up
in
it
at
this
juncture
,
being
the
Plan
of
Dunkirk
 
and
the
tale
of
Dunkirk
a
tale
of
relaxation
,
it
opposed
every
impression
she
could
make
:
 
and
besides
,
could
she
have
gone
upon
it
 
the
manoeuvre
of
fingers
and
hands
in
the
attack
of
the
sentry-
box
,
<EOS>
was
so
outdone
by
that
of
the
fair
Beguine
's
,
in
Trim
's
story
 
<EOS>
that
just
then
,
that
particular
attack
,
however
successful
before
 
became
the
most
heartless
attack
that
could
be
made
    
O
!
<EOS>
let
woman
alone
for
this
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wadman
had
scarce
open'd
<EOS>
the
wicker-
gate
,
when
her
genius
sported
with
the
change
of
circumstances
.
    
<EOS>
She
formed
a
new
attack
in
a
moment
.
      
<EOS>
I
am
half
distracted
,
captain
Shandy
,
said
Mrs.
Wadman
,
holding
up
her
cambrick
handkerchief
to
her
left
eye
,
as
she
<EOS>
approach'd
the
door
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
sentry
-
box
 
<EOS>
a
mote
 
or
sand
 
or
something
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
,
has
got
into
this
eye
of
mine
 
<EOS>
do
look
into
it
 
<EOS>
it
is
not
in
the
white
    
<EOS>
In
saying
which
,
Mrs.
Wadman
edged
herself
close
in
beside
my
uncle
Toby
,
and
squeezing
herself
down
upon
the
corner
of
his
bench
,
she
gave
him
an
opportunity
of
doing
it
without
rising
up
 
<EOS>
Do
look
into
it
 
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
Honest
soul
!
<EOS>
thou
didst
look
into
it
with
as
much
innocency
of
heart
,
as
ever
child
look'd
<EOS>
into
a
raree
-
shew
-
box
;
and
'
twere
as
much
a
sin
to
have
hurt
thee
.
    
<EOS>
If
a
man
will
be
peeping
of
his
own
accord
into
things
of
that
nature
  
<EOS>
I
've
nothing
to
say
to
it
    
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
never
did
:
 
and
I
will
answer
for
him
,
that
he
would
have
sat
quietly
upon
a
sofa
from
June
to
January
(
which
,
you
know
,
takes
in
both
the
hot
and
cold
months
)
,
with
an
eye
as
fine
as
the
Thracian
Rodope
's
(
Rodope
Thracia

inevitabili

,

<EOS>
I
know
not
who

)
<EOS>
besides
him
,
without
being
able
to
tell
,
whether
it
was
a
black
or
blue
one
.
  
<EOS>
The
difficulty
was
to
get
my
uncle
Toby
,
to
look
at
one
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
surmounted
.
 
<EOS>
And
  
I
see
him
yonder
with
his
pipe
pendulous
in
his
hand
,
and
the
ashes
falling
out
of
it
 
looking
 
and
looking
 
then
rubbing
his
eyes
 
and
looking
again
,
with
twice
the
good
-
nature
that
ever
Galileo
look'd
<EOS>
for
a
spot
in
the
sun
.
    
<EOS>
In
vain
!
<EOS>
for
by
all
the
powers
which
animate
the
organ
 
<EOS>
Widow
Wadman
's
left
eye
shines
this
moment
as
lucid
as
her
<EOS>
right
 
<EOS>
there
is
neither
mote
,
or
sand
,
or
dust
,
or
chaff
,
or
speck
,
or
particle
of
opake
matter
floating
in
it
 
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
,
my
dear
paternal
uncle
!
<EOS>
but
one
lambent
delicious
fire
,
furtively
shooting
out
from
every
part
of
it
,
in
all
directions
,
into
thine
      
<EOS>
If
thou
lookest
,
uncle
Toby
,
in
search
of
this
mote
one
moment
longer
,
  
thou
art
undone
.
    
<EOS>
An
eye
is
for
all
the
world
exactly
like
a
cannon
,
in
this
respect
;
That
it
is
not
so
much
the
eye
or
the
cannon
,
in
themselves
,
as
it
is
the
carriage
of
the
eye
 
and
the
carriage
of
the
cannon
,
by
which
both
the
one
and
the
other
are
enabled
to
do
so
much
execution
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
the
comparison
a
bad
one
:
 
<EOS>
However
,
as
'
tis
made
and
placed
at
the
head
of
the
chapter
,
as
much
for
use
as
ornament
,
all
I
desire
in
return
,
is
,
that
whenever
I
speak
of
Mrs.
Wadman
's
eyes
(
except
once
in
the
next
period
)
,
that
you
keep
it
in
your
fancy
.
  
<EOS>
I
protest
,
Madam
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
I
can
see
nothing
whatever
in
your
eye
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
not
in
the
white
;
said
Mrs.
Wadman
:
 
my
uncle
Toby
look'd
<EOS>
with
might
and
main
into
the
pupil
    
Now
of
all
the
eyes
which
ever
were
created
 
from
your
own
,
Madam
,
up
to
those
of
Venus
herself
,
which
certainly
were
as
venereal
a
pair
of
eyes
as
ever
stood
in
a
head
 
<EOS>
there
never
was
an
eye
of
them
all
,
so
fitted
to
rob
my
uncle
Toby
of
his
repose
,
as
the
very
eye
,
at
which
he
was
looking
 
<EOS>
it
was
not
,
<EOS>
Madam
a
rolling
eye
 
<EOS>
a
romping
or
a
wanton
one
 
nor
was
it
an
eye
sparkling
 
petulant
or
imperious
 
of
high
claims
and
terrifying
exactions
,
which
would
have
curdled
at
once
that
milk
of
human
nature
,
of
which
my
uncle
Toby
was
made
up
 
but
'
twas
an
eye
full
of
gentle
salutations
 
and
soft
responses
 
speaking
 
not
like
the
trumpet
stop
of
some
ill
-
made
organ
,
in
which
many
an
eye
I
talk
to
,
holds
coarse
converse
 
but
whispering
soft
 
like
the
last
low
accent
of
an
expiring
saint
 
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
live
comfortless
,
captain
Shandy
,
and
alone
,
without
a
bosom
to
lean
your
head
on
 
or
trust
your
cares
to
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
an
eye
    
<EOS>
But
I
shall
be
in
love
with
it
myself
,
if
I
say
another
word
about
it
.
    
<EOS>
It
did
my
uncle
Toby
's
business
.
    
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
shews
the
character
of
my
father
and
my
uncle
Toby
,
in
a
more
entertaining
light
,
than
their
different
manner
of
deportment
,
under
the
same
accident
 
for
I
call
not
love
a
misfortune
,
from
a
persuasion
,
that
a
man
's
heart
is
ever
the
better
for
it
 
<EOS>
Great
God
!
<EOS>
what
must
my
uncle
Toby
's
have
been
,
when
'
twas
all
benignity
without
it
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
,
as
appears
from
many
of
his
papers
,
was
very
subject
to
this
passion
,
before
he
married
 
but
from
a
little
subacid
kind
of
drollish
impatience
in
his
nature
,
whenever
it
befell
him
,
he
would
never
submit
to
it
like
a
christian
;
but
would
pish
,
and
huff
,
and
bounce
,
and
kick
,
and
play
the
Devil
,
and
write
the
bitterest
Philippicks
against
the
eye
that
ever
man
wrote
 
there
is
one
in
verse
upon
somebody
's
eye
or
other
,
that
for
two
or
three
nights
together
,
had
put
him
by
his
rest
;
which
in
his
first
transport
of
resentment
against
it
,
he
begins
thus
:
  
"
A
Devil
'
tis
 
and
mischief
such
doth
work
As
never
yet
did
Pagan
,
Jew
,
or
Turk
.
"
<EOS>
(
This
will
be
printed
with
my
father

Life

)
  
<EOS>
In
short
,
during
the
whole
paroxism
,
my
father
was
all
abuse
and
foul
language
,
approaching
rather
towards
malediction
 
<EOS>
only
he
did
not
do
it
with
as
much
method
as
Ernulphus
 
<EOS>
he
was
too
impetuous
;
nor
with
Ernulphus
's
policy
 
for
tho
'
my
father
,
with
the
most
intolerant
spirit
,
would
curse
both
this
and
that
,
and
every
thing
under
heaven
,
which
was
either
aiding
or
abetting
to
his
love
 
yet
never
concluded
his
chapter
of
curses
upon
it
,
without
cursing
himself
in
at
the
bargain
,
as
one
of
the
most
egregious
fools
and
cox
-
combs
,
he
would
say
,
that
ever
was
let
loose
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
,
on
the
contrary
,
took
it
like
a
lamb
 
sat
still
and
let
the
poison
work
in
his
veins
without
resistance
 
in
the
sharpest
exacerbations
of
his
wound
(
like
that
on
his
groin
)
<EOS>
he
never
dropt
one
fretful
or
discontented
word
 
he
blamed
neither
heaven
nor
earth
 
or
thought
or
spoke
an
injurious
thing
of
any
body
,
or
any
part
of
it
;
he
sat
solitary
and
pensive
with
his
pipe
 
looking
at
his
lame
leg
 
then
whiffing
out
a
sentimental
heigh
ho
!
<EOS>
which
mixing
with
the
smoke
,
incommoded
no
one
mortal
.
  
<EOS>
He
took
it
like
a
lamb
 
<EOS>
I
say
.
  
<EOS>
In
truth
he
had
mistook
it
at
first
;
for
having
taken
a
ride
with
my
father
,
that
very
morning
,
to
save
if
possible
a
beautiful
wood
,
which
the
dean
and
chapter
were
hewing
down
to
give
to
the
poor
(
Mr.
Shandy
must
mean
the
poor
in
spirit
;
inasmuch
as
they
divided
the
money
amongst
themselves
.
)
;
which
said
wood
being
in
full
view
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
house
,
and
of
singular
service
to
him
in
his
description
of
the
battle
of
Wynnendale
 
by
trotting
on
too

uneasy
saddle

<EOS>
.it
had
so
happened
,
that
the
serous
part
of
the
blood
had
got
betwixt
the
two
skins
,
in
the
nethermost
part
of
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
the
first
shootings
of
which
(
as
my
uncle
Toby
had
no
experience
of
love
)
<EOS>
he
had
taken
for
a
part
of
the
passion
 
till
the
blister
breaking
in
the
one
case
 
and
<EOS>
the
other
remaining
 
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
was
presently
convinced
,
that
his
wound
was
not
a
skin
-
deep
wound
 
but
that
it
had
gone
to
his
heart
.
    
<EOS>
The
world
is
ashamed
of
being
virtuous
 
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
knew
little
of
the
world
;
and
therefore
when
he
felt
he
was
in
love
with
widow
Wadman
,
he
had
no
conception
that
the
thing
was
any
more
to
be
made
a
mystery
of
,
than
if
Mrs.
Wadman
had
given
him
a
cut
with
a
gap'd
knife
across
his
finger
:
 
<EOS>
Had
it
been
otherwise
 
yet
<EOS>
as
he
ever
look'd
upon
Trim
as
a
humble
friend
;
and
saw
fresh
reasons
every
day
of
his
life
,
to
treat
him
as
such
 
it
would
have
made
no
variation
in
the
manner
in
which
he
informed
him
of
the
affair
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
in
love
,
corporal
!
"
<EOS>
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
.
    
<EOS>
In
love
!
 
<EOS>
said
the
corporal
 
<EOS>
your
honour
was
very
well
the
day
before
yesterday
,
when
I
was
telling
your
honour
of
the
story
of
the
King
of
Bohemia
 
Bohemia
!
<EOS>
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
.
<EOS>
.musing
<EOS>
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
.
<EOS>
.What
became
of
that
story
,
Trim
?
    
<EOS>
We
lost
it
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
somehow
betwixt
us
 
<EOS>
but
your
honour
was
as
free
from
love
then
,
as
I
am
 
'
twas
<EOS>
just
whilst
thou
went'st
<EOS>
off
with
the
wheel
-
barrow
 
with
Mrs.
Wadman
,
quoth
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
 
<EOS>
She
has
left
a
ball
here
 
<EOS>
added
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
 
pointing
to
his
breast
      
<EOS>
She
can
no
more
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
stand
a
siege
,
than
she
can
fly
 
cried
the
corporal
      
<EOS>
But
as
we
are
neighbours
,
Trim
,
 
the
best
way
I
think
is
to
let
her
know
it
civilly
first
 
<EOS>
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
.
  
<EOS>
Now
if
I
might
presume
,
said
the
corporal
,
to
differ
from
your
honour
      
<EOS>
Why
else
do
I
talk
to
thee
,
Trim
?
<EOS>
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
mildly
      
<EOS>
Then
I
would
begin
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
with
making
a
good
thundering
attack
upon
her
,
in
return
 
and
telling
her
civilly
afterwards
 
for
if
she
knows
any
thing
of
your
honour
's
being
in
love
,
before
hand
 
L
..
d
help
her
!
 
<EOS>
she
knows
no
more
at
present
of
it
,
Trim
,
said
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
 
than
the
child
unborn
    
Precious
souls
!
    
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wadman
had
told
it
,
with
all
its
circumstances
,
to
Mrs.
Bridget
twenty
-
four
hours
before
;
and
was
at
that
very
moment
sitting
in
council
with
her
,
touching
some
slight
misgivings
with
regard
to
the
issue
of
the
affairs
,
which
the
Devil
,
who
never
lies
dead
in
a
ditch
,
had
put
into
her
head
 
before
he
would
allow
half
time
,
to
get
quietly
through
her
Te
Deum
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
terribly
afraid
,
said
widow
Wadman
,
in
case
I
should
marry
him
,
Bridget
 
that
the
poor
captain
will
not
enjoy
his
health
,
with
the
monstrous
wound
upon
his
groin
    
<EOS>
It
may
not
,
Madam
,
be
so
very
large
,
replied
Bridget
,
as
you
think
 
<EOS>
and
I
believe
,
<EOS>
besides
,
added
she
 
<EOS>
that
'
tis
dried
up
      
I
could
like
to
know
 
merely
for
his
sake
,
said
Mrs.
Wadman
      
<EOS>
We
'll
know
and
long
and
the
broad
of
it
,
in
ten
days
 
answered
Mrs.
Bridget
,
for
whilst
the
captain
is
paying
his
addresses
to
you
 
<EOS>
I
'm
confident
Mr.
Trim
will
be
for
making
love
to
me
 
<EOS>
and
I
'll
let
him
as
much
as
he
will
 
added
<EOS>
Bridget
 
<EOS>
to
get
it
all
out
of
him
    
<EOS>
The
measures
were
taken
at
once
 
and
my
uncle
Toby
and
the
corporal
went
on
with
theirs
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
quoth
the
corporal
,
setting
his
left
hand
a
-
kimbo
,
and
giving
such
a
flourish
with
his
right
,
as
just
promised
success
 
and
no
more
 
if
your
honour
will
give
me
leave
to
lay
down
the
plan
of
this
attack
      
<EOS>
Thou
wilt
please
me
by
it
,
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
exceedingly
 
<EOS>
and
as
I
foresee
thou
must
act
in
it
as
my
aid
de
camp
<EOS>
,
here
's
a
crown
,
corporal
,
to
begin
with
,
to
steep
thy
commission
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
said
the
corporal
(
making
a
bow
first
for
his
commission
)
 
we
will
begin
with
getting
your
honour
's
laced
clothes
out
of
the
great
campaign
-
trunk
,
to
be
well
air'd
,
and
have
the
blue
and
gold
taken
up
at
the
sleeves
 
<EOS>
and
I
'll
put
your
white
ramallie
-
wig
fresh
into
pipes
 
and
send
for
a
taylor
,
to
have
your
honour
's
thin
scarlet
breeches
turn'd
      
<EOS>
I
had
better
take
the
red
plush
ones
,
quoth
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
 
<EOS>
They
will
be
too
clumsy
 
said
the
corporal
.
      
<EOS>
Thou
wilt
get
a
brush
and
a
little
chalk
to
my
sword
 
<EOS>
'
Twill
be
only
in
your
honour
's
way
,
replied
Trim
.
      
<EOS>
But
your
honour
's
two
razors
shall
be
new
set
 
<EOS>
and
I
will
get
my
Montero
cap
<EOS>
furbish'd
up
,
and
put
on
poor
lieutenant
Le
Fever
's
regimental
coat
,
which
your
honour
gave
me
to
wear
for
his
sake
 
<EOS>
and
as
soon
as
your
honour
is
clean
shaved
 
and
has
got
your
clean
shirt
on
,
with
your
blue
and
gold
,
or
your
fine
scarlet
 
<EOS>
sometimes
one
and
sometimes
t'other
 
and
every
thing
is
ready
for
the
attack
 
<EOS>
we
'll
march
up
boldly
,
as
if
'
twas
to
the
face
of
a
bastion
;
and
whilst
your
honour
engages
Mrs.
Wadman
in
the
parlour
,
to
the
right
 
I
'll
attack
Mrs.
Bridget
in
the
kitchen
,
to
the
left
;
and
having
seiz'd
the
pass
,
I
'll
answer
for
it
,
said
the
corporal
,
snapping
his
fingers
over
his
head
 
that
the
day
is
our
own
.
  
<EOS>
I
wish
I
may
but
manage
it
right
;
said
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
but
I
declare
,
<EOS>
corporal
,
I
had
rather
march
up
to
the
very
edge
of
a
trench
      
A
woman
is
quite
a
different
thing
 
<EOS>
said
the
corporal
.
    
<EOS>
I
suppose
so
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
.
    
<EOS>
If
any
thing
in
this
world
,
which
my
father
said
,
could
have
provoked
my
uncle
Toby
,
during
the
time
he
was
in
love
,
it
was
the
perverse
use
my
father
was
always
making
of
an
expression
of
Hilarion
the
hermit
;
who
,
in
speaking
of
his
abstinence
,
his
watchings
,
flagellations
,
and
other
instrumental
parts
of
his
religion
 
would
say
 
tho
'
with
more
facetiousness
than
became
an
hermit
 
"
That
they
were
the
means
he
used
,
to
make
his
ass
(
meaning
his
body
)
leave
off
kicking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
pleased
my
father
well
;
it
was
not
only
a
laconick
way
of
expressing
  
but
of
libelling
,
at
the
same
time
,
the
desires
and
appetites
of
the
lower
part
of
us
;
so
that
for
many
years
of
my
father
's
life
,
'
twas
his
constant
mode
of
expression
 
he
never
used
the
word
passions
once
 
but
ass
always
instead
of
them
 
So
that
he
might
be
said
truly
,
to
have
been
upon
the
bones
,
or
the
back
of
his
own
ass
,
or
else
of
some
other
man
's
,
during
all
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
here
observe
to
you
<EOS>
the
difference
betwixt
My
father
's
ass
and
my
hobby
-
horse
 
in
order
to
keep
characters
as
separate
as
may
be
,
in
our
fancies
as
we
go
along
.
  
<EOS>
For
my
hobby
-
horse
,
if
you
recollect
a
little
,
is
no
way
a
vicious
beast
;
he
has
scarce
one
hair
or
lineament
of
the
ass
about
him
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
<EOS>
the
sporting
little
filly
-
folly
which
carries
you
out
for
the
present
hour
 
a
maggot
,
a
butterfly
,
a
picture
,
a
fiddlestick
 
<EOS>
an
uncle
Toby
's
siege
 
or
an
any
thing
,
which
a
man
makes
a
shift
to
get
a
-
stride
on
,
to
canter
it
away
from
the
cares
and
solicitudes
of
life
 
<EOS>
"
Tis
as
useful
a
beast
as
is
in
the
whole
creation
 
nor
do
I
really
see
how
the
world
could
do
without
it
      
<EOS>
But
for
my
father
's
ass
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
mount
him
 
<EOS>
mount
him
 
<EOS>
mount
him
 
<EOS>
(
that
's
three
times
,
is
it
not
?
)
 
<EOS>
mount
him
not
:
 
'
tis
a
beast
concupiscent
 
and
foul
befal
<EOS>
the
man
,
who
does
not
hinder
him
from
kicking
.
    
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
dear
brother
Toby
,
said
my
father
,
upon
his
first
seeing
him
after
he
fell
in
love
 
and
how
goes
it
with
your
Asse
?
  
<EOS>
Now
my
uncle
Toby
thinking
more
of
the
part
where
he
had
had
the
blister
,
than
of
Hilarion
's
metaphor
 
and
our
preconceptions
having
(
you
know
)
as
great
a
power
over
the
sounds
of
words
as
the
shapes
of
things
,
he
had
imagined
,
that
my
father
,
who
was
not
very
ceremonious
in
his
choice
of
words
,
had
enquired
after
the
part
by
its
proper
name
:
<EOS>
so
notwithstanding
my
mother
,
doctor
Slop
,
and
Mr.
Yorick
,
were
sitting
in
the
parlour
,
he
thought
it
rather
civil
to
conform
to
the
term
my
father
had
made
use
of
than
not
.
 
<EOS>
When
a
man
is
hemm'd
in
by
two
indecorums
,
and
must
commit
one
of
'em
 
<EOS>
I
always
observe
 
<EOS>
let
him
chuse
which
he
will
,
the
world
will
blame
him
 
so
I
should
not
be
astonished
if
it
blames
my
uncle
Toby
.
  
<EOS>
My
A
..
e
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
is
much
better
 
<EOS>
brother
Shandy
 
<EOS>
My
father
had
formed
great
expectations
from
his
Asse
in
this
onset
;
and
would
have
brought
him
on
again
;
but
doctor
Slop
setting
up
an
intemperate
laugh
 
and
my
mother
crying
out
L
...
bless
us
!
 
<EOS>
it
drove
my
father
's
Asse
off
the
field
 
and
the
laugh
then
becoming
general
 
<EOS>
there
was
no
bringing
him
back
to
the
charge
,
for
some
time
    
<EOS>
And
so
the
discourse
went
on
without
him
.
  
<EOS>
Every
body
,
said
my
mother
,
says
you
are
in
love
,
brother
Toby
,
 
and
<EOS>
we
hope
it
is
true
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
as
much
in
love
,
sister
<EOS>
,
I
believe
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
,
as
any
man
usually
is
 
Humph
!
<EOS>
said
my
father
 
<EOS>
and
when
did
you
know
it
?
<EOS>
quoth
<EOS>
my
mother
      
<EOS>
When
the
blister
broke
;
replied
my
uncle
Toby
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
's
reply
put
my
father
into
good
temper
 
so
he
charg'd
o
'
foot
.
    
<EOS>
As
the
ancients
agree
,
brother
Toby
,
said
my
father
,
that
there
are
two
different
and
distinct
kinds
of
love
,
according
to
the
different
parts
which
are
affected
by
it
 
<EOS>
the
Brain
or
Liver
 
<EOS>
I
think
when
a
man
is
in
love
,
it
behoves
him
a
little
to
consider
which
of
the
two
he
is
fallen
into
.
  
<EOS>
What
signifies
it
,
brother
Shandy
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
,
which
of
the
two
it
is
,
provided
it
will
but
make
a
man
marry
,
and
love
his
wife
,
and
get
a
few
children
?
    
<EOS>
A
few
children
!
<EOS>
cried
my
father
,
rising
out
of
his
chair
,
and
looking
full
in
my
mother
's
face
,
as
he
forced
his
way
betwixt
<EOS>
her
's
and
doctor
Slop
's
 
a
few
children
!
<EOS>
cried
my
father
,
repeating
my
uncle
Toby
's
words
as
he
walk'd
to
and
fro
      
<EOS>
Not
,
my
dear
brother
Toby
,
cried
my
father
,
recovering
himself
all
at
once
,
and
coming
close
up
to
the
back
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
chair
 
not
that
I
should
be
sorry
hadst
thou
a
score
 
on
the
contrary
,
I
should
rejoice
 
and
be
as
kind
,
Toby
,
to
every
one
of
them
as
a
father
    
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
stole
his
hand
unperceived
behind
his
chair
,
to
give
my
father
's
a
squeeze
      
<EOS>
Nay
,
moreover
,
continued
he
,
keeping
hold
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
hand
 
<EOS>
so
much
dost
thou
possess
,
my
dear
Toby
,
of
the
milk
of
human
nature
,
and
so
little
of
its
asperities
 
'
tis
piteous
the
world
is
not
peopled
by
creatures
which
resemble
thee
;
and
was
I
an
Asiatic
monarch
,
added
my
father
,
heating
himself
with
his
new
project
 
<EOS>
I
would
oblige
thee
,
provided
it
would
not
impair
thy
strength
 
or
dry
up
thy
radical
moisture
too
fast
  
or
weaken
thy
memory
or
fancy
,
brother
Toby
,
which
these
gymnics
inordinately
taken
<EOS>
are
apt
to
do
 
else
,
dear
Toby
,
I
would
procure
thee
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
my
empire
,
and
I
would
oblige
thee
,
nolens
,
volens
,
to
beget
for
me
one
subject
every
month
    
<EOS>
As
my
father
pronounced
the
last
word
of
the
sentence
 
<EOS>
my
mother
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
.
  
<EOS>
Now
I
would
not
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
get
a
child
,
nolens
,
volens
,
that
is
,
whether
I
would
or
no
,
to
please
the
greatest
prince
upon
earth
      
And
"
twould
be
cruel
in
me
,
brother
Toby
,
to
compel
thee
;
said
my
father
 
<EOS>
but
'
tis
a
case
put
to
shew
thee
,
that
it
is
not
thy
begetting
a
child
 
<EOS>
in
case
thou
should'st
be
able
 
<EOS>
but
the
system
of
Love
and
Marriage
thou
goest
upon
,
which
I
would
set
thee
right
in
    
<EOS>
There
is
at
least
,
said
Yorick
,
a
great
deal
of
reason
and
plain
sense
in
captain
Shandy
's
opinion
of
love
;
and
'
tis
amongst
the
ill
-
spent
hours
of
my
life
,
which
I
have
to
answer
for
,
that
I
have
read
so
many
flourishing
poets
and
rhetoricians
in
my
time
,
from
whom
I
never
could
extract
so
much
    
I
wish
,
Yorick
,
said
my
father
,
you
had
read
Plato
;
for
there
you
would
have
learnt
that
there
are
two
Loves
 
<EOS>
I
know
there
were
two
Religions
,
replied
Yorick
,
amongst
the
ancients
 
<EOS>
one
 
for
the
vulgar
,
and
another
for
the
learned
;
 
<EOS>
but
I
think
One
Love
might
have
served
both
of
them
very
well
    
<EOS>
I
could
not
;
replied
my
father
 
and
for
the
same
reasons
:
 
for
of
these
Loves
,
according
to
Ficinus
's
comment
upon
Velasius
,
the
one
is
rational
      
<EOS>
the
other
is
natural
 
the
first
ancient
 
without
mother
 
where
Venus
had
nothing
to
do
:
 
the
second
,
begotten
of
Jupiter
and
Dione
      
Pray
,
brother
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
what
has
a
man
who
believes
in
God
to
do
with
this
?
 
<EOS>
My
father
could
not
stop
to
answer
,
for
fear
of
breaking
the
thread
of
his
discourse
    
<EOS>
This
latter
,
continued
he
,
partakes
wholly
of
the
nature
of
Venus
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
,
which
is
the
golden
chain
let
down
from
heaven
,
excites
to
love
heroic
,
which
comprehends
in
it
,
and
excites
to
the
desire
of
philosophy
and
truth
 
the
second
,
excites
to
desire
,
simply
      
I
think
the
procreation
of
children
as
beneficial
to
the
world
,
said
Yorick
,
as
the
finding
out
the
longitude
      
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
said
my
mother
,
love
keeps
peace
in
the
world
      
<EOS>
In
the
house
 
<EOS>
my
dear
<EOS>
,
I
own
      
<EOS>
It
replenishes
the
earth
;
said
my
mother
    
<EOS>
But
it
keeps
heaven
empty
 
<EOS>
my
dear
;
replied
my
father
.
    
<EOS>
'
Tis
Virginity
,
cried
Slop
,
triumphantly
,
which
fills
paradise
.
  
<EOS>
Well
push'd
nun
!
<EOS>
quoth
my
father
.
    
<EOS>
My
father
had
such
a
skirmishing
,
cutting
kind
of
a
slashing
way
with
him
in
his
disputations
,
thrusting
and
ripping
,
and
giving
every
one
a
stroke
to
remember
him
by
in
his
turn
 
that
if
there
were
twenty
people
in
company
 
in
less
than
half
an
hour
he
was
sure
to
have
every
one
of
'em
against
him
.
  
<EOS>
What
did
not
a
little
contribute
to
leave
him
thus
without
an
ally
,
was
,
that
if
there
was
any
one
post
more
untenable
than
the
rest
,
he
would
be
sure
to
throw
himself
into
it
;
and
to
do
him
justice
,
<EOS>
when
he
was
once
there
,
he
would
defend
it
so
gallantly
,
that
"
twould
have
been
a
concern
,
either
to
a
brave
man
or
a
good
-
natured
one
,
to
have
seen
him
driven
out
.
  
<EOS>
Yorick
,
for
this
reason
,
though
he
would
often
attack
him
 
yet
could
never
bear
to
do
it
with
all
his
force
.
  
<EOS>
Doctor
Slop
's
Virginity
,
in
the
close
of
the
last
chapter
,
had
got
him
for
once
on
the
right
side
of
the
rampart
;
and
he
was
beginning
to
blow
up
all
the
convents
in
Christendom
about
Slop
's
ears
,
when
corporal
Trim
came
into
the
parlour
to
inform
my
uncle
Toby
,
that
his
thin
scarlet
breeches
,
in
which
the
attack
was
to
be
made
upon
Mrs.
Wadman
,
would
not
do
;
for
that
the
taylor
,
in
ripping
them
up
,
in
order
to
turn
them
,
had
found
they
had
been
turn'd
before
 
Then
turn
them
again
,
brother
,
said
my
father
,
rapidly
,
for
there
will
be
many
a
turning
of
'em
yet
<EOS>
before
all
's
done
in
the
affair
 
<EOS>
They
are
as
rotten
as
dirt
,
said
the
corporal
 
<EOS>
Then
by
all
means
,
said
my
father
,
bespeak
a
new
pair
,
brother
 
<EOS>
for
though
I
know
,
continued
my
father
,
turning
himself
to
the
company
,
that
widow
Wadman
has
been
deeply
in
love
with
my
brother
Toby
for
many
years
,
and
has
used
every
art
and
circumvention
of
woman
to
outwit
him
into
the
same
passion
,
yet
now
that
she
has
caught
him
 
her
fever
will
be
pass'd
its
height
      
<EOS>
She
has
gained
her
point
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
case
,
continued
my
father
,
which
Plato
,
I
am
persuaded
,
never
thought
of
 
Love
,
you
see
,
is
not
so
much
a
Sentiment
as
a
Situation
,
into
which
a
man
enters
,
as
my
brother
Toby
would
do
,
into
a
corps
 
no
matter
whether
he
loves
the
service
or
no
 
being
once
in
it
 
<EOS>
he
acts
as
if
he
did
;
and
takes
every
step
to
shew
himself
a
man
of
prowesse
.
  
<EOS>
The
hypothesis
,
like
the
rest
of
my
father
's
,
was
plausible
enough
,
and
my
uncle
Toby
had
but
<EOS>
a
single
word
to
object
to
it
 
in
which
Trim
stood
ready
to
second
him
 
but
my
father
had
not
drawn
his
conclusion
    
For
this
reason
,
continued
my
father
(
stating
the
case
over
again
)
  
<EOS>
notwithstanding
all
the
world
knows
,
that
Mrs.
Wadman
affects
my
brother
<EOS>
Toby
 
and
<EOS>
my
brother
Toby
contrariwise
affects
Mrs.
Wadman
,
and
no
obstacle
in
nature
to
forbid
the
music
striking
up
this
very
night
,
yet
will
I
answer
for
it
,
that
this
self
-
same
tune
will
not
be
<EOS>
play'd
<EOS>
this
twelvemonth
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
taken
our
measures
badly
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
looking
up
interrogatively
in
Trim
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
lay
my
Montero
-
cap
,
said
Trim
 
<EOS>
Now
Trim
's
Montero
-
cap
,
as
I
once
told
you
,
was
his
constant
wager
;
and
having
furbish'd
it
up
that
very
night
,
<EOS>
in
order
to
go
upon
the
attack
 
it
made
the
odds
look
more
considerable
 
<EOS>
I
would
lay
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
my
Montero
-
cap
to
a
shilling
 
<EOS>
was
it
proper
,
continued
Trim
(
making
a
bow
)
,
to
offer
a
wager
before
your
honours
      
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
improper
in
it
,
said
my
father
 
'
tis
a
mode
of
expression
;
for
in
saying
thou
would'st
lay
thy
Montero
-
cap
to
a
shilling
  
<EOS>
all
thou
meanest
is
this
 
that
thou
believest
      
<EOS>
Now
,
What
do'st
thou
believe
?
  
<EOS>
That
widow
Wadman
,
an
'
please
your
worship
,
can
not
hold
it
out
ten
days
    
<EOS>
And
whence
,
cried
Slop
,
jeeringly
,
hast
thou
all
this
knowledge
of
woman
,
friend
?
  
<EOS>
By
falling
in
love
with
a
popish
clergy
-
woman
;
said
Trim
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Twas
<EOS>
a
Beguine
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
  
<EOS>
Doctor
Slop
was
too
much
in
wrath
to
listen
to
the
distinction
;
and
my
father
taking
that
very
crisis
to
fall
in
helter
-
skelter
upon
the
whole
order
of
Nuns
and
Beguines
,
a
set
of
silly
,
fusty
,
baggages
 
<EOS>
Slop
could
not
stand
it
 
and
my
uncle
Toby
having
some
measures
to
take
about
his
breeches
 
and
Yorick
about
his
fourth
general
division
 
in
order
for
their
several
attacks
next
day
 
the
company
broke
up
:
 
and
my
father
being
left
alone
,
and
having
half
an
hour
upon
his
hands
betwixt
that
and
bed
-
time
;
he
called
for
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
and
wrote
my
uncle
Toby
the
following
letter
of
instructions
:
   
<EOS>
My
dear
brother
Toby
,
  
What
I
am
going
to
say
to
thee
is
upon
the
nature
of
women
,
and
of
love-
making
to
them
;
and
perhaps
it
is
as
well
for
thee
 
<EOS>
tho
'
not
so
well
for
me
 
that
thou
hast
occasion
for
a
letter
of
instructions
upon
that
head
,
and
that
I
am
able
to
write
it
to
thee
.
  
<EOS>
Had
it
been
the
good
pleasure
of
him
who
disposes
of
our
lots
 
and
thou
<EOS>
no
sufferer
by
the
knowledge
<EOS>
,
I
had
been
well
content
that
thou
should'st
have
<EOS>
dipp'd
<EOS>
the
pen
this
moment
into
the
ink
,
instead
of
myself
;
but
that
not
being
the
case
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Shandy
being
now
close
beside
me
,
preparing
for
bed
 
I
have
thrown
together
without
order
,
and
just
as
they
have
come
into
my
mind
,
such
hints
and
documents
as
I
deem
may
be
of
use
to
thee
;
intending
,
in
this
,
to
give
thee
a
token
of
my
love
;
not
doubting
,
my
dear
Toby
,
of
the
manner
in
which
it
will
be
accepted
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
with
regard
to
all
which
concerns
religion
in
the
affair
 
though
I
perceive
from
a
glow
in
my
cheek
,
that
I
blush
as
I
begin
to
speak
to
thee
upon
the
subject
,
as
well
knowing
,
notwithstanding
thy
unaffected
secrecy
,
how
few
of
its
offices
thou
neglectest
 
<EOS>
yet
I
would
remind
thee
of
one
(
during
the
continuance
of
thy
courtship
)
in
a
particular
manner
,
which
I
would
not
have
omitted
;
and
that
is
,
never
to
go
forth
upon
the
enterprize
,
whether
it
be
in
the
morning
or
the
afternoon
,
without
first
recommending
thyself
to
the
protection
of
Almighty
God
,
that
he
may
defend
thee
from
the
evil
one
.
  
<EOS>
Shave
the
whole
top
of
thy
crown
clean
once
at
least
every
four
or
five
days
,
but
oftner
if
convenient
;
lest
in
taking
off
thy
wig
before
her
,
thro
'
absence
of
mind
,
she
should
be
able
to
discover
how
much
has
been
cut
away
by
Time
 
how
much
by
Trim
.
    
<EOS>
'
Twere
better
to
keep
ideas
of
baldness
out
of
her
fancy
.
  
<EOS>
Always
carry
it
in
thy
mind
,
and
act
upon
it
as
a
sure
maxim
,
Toby
    
"
<EOS>
That
women
are
timid
:
"
 
And
<EOS>
'
tis
<EOS>
well
they
are
 
else
<EOS>
there
would
be
no
dealing
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
Let
not
thy
breeches
be
too
tight
,
or
hang
too
loose
about
thy
thighs
,
like
the
trunk
-
hose
of
our
ancestors
.
    
<EOS>
A
just
medium
prevents
all
conclusions
.
  
<EOS>
Whatever
thou
hast
to
say
,
be
it
more
or
less
,
forget
not
to
utter
it
in
a
low
soft
tone
of
voice
.
 
<EOS>
Silence
,
and
whatever
approaches
it
,
weaves
dreams
of
midnight
secrecy
into
the
brain
:
 
For
this
cause
,
if
thou
canst
help
it
,
never
throw
down
the
tongs
and
poker
.
  
<EOS>
Avoid
all
kinds
of
pleasantry
and
facetiousness
in
thy
discourse
with
her
,
and
do
whatever
lies
in
thy
power
at
the
same
time
,
to
keep
her
from
all
books
and
writings
which
tend
thereto
:
 
there
are
some
devotional
tracts
,
which
if
thou
canst
entice
her
to
read
over
 
it
will
be
well
:
 
but
suffer
her
not
to
look
into
Rabelais
,
or
Scarron
,
or
Don
Quixote
      
<EOS>
They
are
all
books
which
excite
laughter
;
and
thou
knowest
,
dear
Toby
,
that
there
is
no
passion
so
serious
as
lust
.
  
<EOS>
Stick
a
pin
in
the
bosom
of
thy
shirt
,
before
thou
enterest
<EOS>
her
parlour
.
  
<EOS>
And
if
thou
art
permitted
to
sit
upon
the
same
sopha
with
her
,
and
she
gives
thee
occasion
to
lay
thy
hand
upon
hers
 
<EOS>
beware
of
taking
it
 
thou
canst
not
lay
thy
hand
on
hers
,
but
she
will
feel
the
temper
of
thine
.
 
<EOS>
Leave
that
<EOS>
and
as
many
other
things
as
thou
canst
,
quite
undetermined
;
by
so
doing
,
thou
wilt
have
her
curiosity
on
thy
side
;
and
if
she
is
not
conquered
by
that
,
and
thy
Asse
continues
still
kicking
,
which
there
is
great
reason
to
suppose
 
Thou
must
begin
,
with
first
losing
a
few
ounces
of
blood
below
the
ears
,
according
to
the
practice
of
the
ancient
Scythians
,
who
cured
the
most
intemperate
fits
of
the
appetite
by
that
means
.
  
<EOS>
Avicenna
,
after
this
,
is
for
having
the
part
anointed
with
the
syrup
of
hellebore
,
using
proper
evacuations
and
purges
 
<EOS>
and
I
believe
rightly
.
 
<EOS>
But
thou
must
eat
little
or
no
goat
's
flesh
,
nor
red
deer
 
nor
even
foal
's
flesh
by
any
means
;
and
carefully
abstain
 
that
is
,
as
much
as
thou
canst
,
from
peacocks
,
cranes
,
coots
,
didappers
,
and
water
-
hens
    
As
for
thy
drink
 
<EOS>
I
need
not
tell
thee
,
it
must
be
the
infusion
of
Vervain
and
the
herb
Hanea
,
of
which
Aelian
relates
such
effects
 
<EOS>
but
if
thy
stomach
palls
with
it
 
discontinue
it
from
time
to
time
,
taking
cucumbers
,
melons
,
purslane
,
water
-
lillies
,
woodbine
,
and
lettice
,
in
the
stead
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
further
for
thee
,
which
occurs
to
me
at
present
      
<EOS>
Unless
the
breaking
out
of
a
fresh
war
 
<EOS>
So
wishing
every
thing
,
dear
Toby
,
for
best
,
  
I
rest
thy
affectionate

Whilst
my
father
was
writing
his
letter
of
instructions
,
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
and
the
corporal
were
busy
in
preparing
every
thing
for
the
attack
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
turning
of
the
thin
scarlet
breeches
was
laid
aside
(
at
least
for
the
present
)
,
there
was
nothing
which
should
put
it
off
beyond
the
next
morning
;
<EOS>
so
accordingly
it
was
resolv'd
upon
,
for
eleven
o'clock

<EOS>
Come
,
my
dear
,
said
my
father
to
my
mother
 
'
twill
be
<EOS>
but
like
a
brother
and
sister
,
if
you
and
I
take
a
walk
down
to
my
brother
Toby
's
 
to
countenance
him
in
this
attack
of
his
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
and
the
corporal
had
been
accoutred
both
some
time
,
when
my
father
and
mother
enter'd
,
and
the
clock
striking
eleven
,
were
that
moment
in
motion
to
sally
forth
 
but
the
account
of
this
is
worth
more
than
to
be
wove
into
the
fag
end
of
the
eighth
<EOS>
(
Alluding
to
the
first
edition
.
)
<EOS>
volume
of
such
a
work
as
this
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
had
no
time
but
to
put
the
letter
of
instructions
into
my
uncle
Toby
's
coat
-
pocket
 
and
join
with
my
mother
in
wishing
his
attack
prosperous
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
like
,
said
my
mother
,
to
look
through
the
key
-
hole
out
of
curiosity
 
<EOS>
Call
it
by
its
right
name
,
my
dear
,
quoth
my
father
    
And
look
through
the
key
-
hole
as
long
as
you
will
.
    
<EOS>
I
call
all
the
powers
of
time
and
chance
,
which
severally
check
us
in
our
careers
in
this
world
,
to
bear
me
witness
,
that
I
could
never
yet
get
fairly
to
my
uncle
Toby
's
amours
,
till
this
very
moment
,
<EOS>
that
my
mother
's
curiosity
,
as
she
stated
the
affair
,
 
or
a
different
impulse
in
her
,
as
my
father
would
have
it
 
wished
her
to
take
a
peep
at
them
through
the
key-
hole
.
  
<EOS>
"
Call
it
,
my

,
by
its
right

my

and

through
the
key

hole
as

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Nothing
but
the
fermentation
of
that
little
subacid
humour
,
which
I
have
often
spoken
of
,
in
my
father
's
habit
,
could
have
vented
such
an
insinuation
 
<EOS>
he
was
however
frank
and
generous
in
his
nature
,
and
at
all
times
open
to
conviction
;
so
that
he
had
scarce
got
to
the
last
word
of
this
ungracious
retort
,
when
his
conscience
smote
him
.
  
<EOS>
My
mother
was
then
conjugally
swinging
with
her
left
arm
twisted
under
his
right
,
in
such
wise
,
that
the
inside
of
her
hand
rested
upon
the
back
of
his
 
<EOS>
she
raised
her
fingers
,
and
let
them
fall
 
<EOS>
it
could
scarce
be
call'd
a
tap
;
or
if
it
was
a
tap
 
'
twould
have
puzzled
a
casuist
to
say
,
whether
'
twas
a
tap
of
remonstrance
,
or
a
tap
of
confession
:
 
my
father
,
who
was
all
sensibilities
from
head
to
foot
,
<EOS>
class'd
<EOS>
it
right
 
<EOS>
Conscience
redoubled
her
blow
 
he
turn'd
<EOS>
his
face
suddenly
the
other
way
,
and
my
mother
supposing
his
body
was
about
to
turn
with
it
in
order
to
move
homewards
,
by
a
cross
movement
of
her
right
leg
,
keeping
her
left
as
its
centre
,
brought
herself
so
far
in
front
,
that
as
he
turned
his
head
,
he
met
her
eye
  
Confusion
again
!
<EOS>
he
saw
a
thousand
reasons
to
wipe
out
the
reproach
,
and
as
many
to
reproach
himself
 
a
thin
,
blue
,
chill
,
pellucid
chrystal
with
all
its
humours
so
at
rest
,
the
least
mote
or
speck
of
desire
might
have
been
seen
,
at
the
bottom
of
it
,
had
it
existed
 
it
did
not
 
and
how
I
happen
to
be
so
lewd
myself
,
particularly
a
little
before
the
vernal
and
autumnal
equinoxes
 
Heaven
above
<EOS>
knows
 
<EOS>
My
mother
 
madam
 
was
so
at
no
time
,
either
by
nature
,
by
institution
,
or
example
.
  
<EOS>
A
temperate
current
of
blood
ran
orderly
through
her
veins
in
all
months
of
the
year
,
and
in
all
critical
moments
both
of
the
day
and
night
alike
;
nor
did
she
superinduce
the
least
heat
into
her
humours
from
the
manual
effervescencies
of
devotional
tracts
,
which
having
little
or
no
meaning
in
them
<EOS>
,
nature
is
oft
-
times
obliged
to
find
one
 
<EOS>
And
as
for
my
father
's
example
!
'
<EOS>
twas
so
far
from
being
either
aiding
or
abetting
thereunto
,
that
'
twas
the
whole
business
of
his
life
,
to
keep
all
fancies
of
that
kind
out
of
her
head
 
Nature
had
done
her
part
,
to
have
spared
him
this
trouble
;
and
what
was
not
a
little
inconsistent
,
my
father
knew
it
 
<EOS>
And
here
am
I
sitting
,
this
12th
day
of
August
1766
,
in
a
purple
jerkin
and
yellow
pair
of
slippers
,
without
either
wig
or
cap
on
,
a
most
tragicomical
completion
of
his
prediction
,
"
That
I
should
neither
think
,
nor
act
like
any
other
man
's
child
,
upon
that
very
account
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
mistake
in
my
father
,
was
in
attacking
my
mother
's
motive
,
instead
of
the
act
itself
;
for
certainly
key
-
holes
were
made
for
other
purposes
;
and
considering
the
act
,
as
an
act
which
interfered
with
a
true
proposition
,
and
denied
a
key
-
hole
to
be
what
it
was
 
<EOS>
it
became
a
violation
of
nature
;
and
was
so
far
,
you
see
,
criminal
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
for
this
reason
,
an
'
please
your
Reverences
,
That
key
-
holes
are
the
occasions
of
more
sin
and
wickedness
,
than
all
other
holes
in
this
world
put
together
.
    
<EOS>
which
leads
me
to
my
uncle
Toby
's
amours
.
    
<EOS>
Though
the
corporal
had
been
as
good
as
his
word
in
putting
my
uncle
Toby
's
great
ramallie
-
wig
into
pipes
,
yet
the
time
was
too
short
to
produce
any
great
effects
from
it
:
it
had
lain
many
years
squeezed
up
in
the
corner
of
his
old
campaign
trunk
;
and
as
bad
forms
are
not
so
easy
to
be
got
the
better
of
,
and
the
use
of
candle
-
ends
not
so
well
understood
,
it
was
not
so
pliable
a
business
as
one
would
have
wished
.
 
<EOS>
The
corporal
with
cheary
eye
and
both
arms
extended
,
had
fallen
back
perpendicular
from
it
a
score
times
,
to
inspire
it
,
if
possible
,
with
a
better
air
 
<EOS>
had
Spleen
given
a
look
at
it
<EOS>
,
"
twould
have
cost
her
ladyship
a
smile
 
<EOS>
it
curl'd
<EOS>
every
where
but
where
the
corporal
would
have
it
;
and
where
a
buckle
or
two
,
in
his
opinion
,
would
have
done
it
honour
,
he
could
as
soon
have
raised
the
dead
.
  
<EOS>
Such
it
was
 
or
rather
such
<EOS>
would
it
have
seem'd
upon
any
other
brow
;
but
the
sweet
look
of
goodness
which
sat
upon
my
uncle
Toby
's
,
assimilated
every
thing
around
it
so
sovereignly
to
itself
,
and
Nature
had
moreover
wrote
Gentleman
with
so
fair
a
hand
in
every
line
of
his
countenance
,
that
even
his
tarnish'd
gold
-
laced
hat
and
huge
cockade
of
flimsy
taffeta
became
him
;
and
though
not
worth
a
button
in
themselves
,
yet
the
moment
my
uncle
Toby
put
them
on
,
they
became
serious
objects
,
and
altogether
seem'd
to
have
been
picked
up
by
the
hand
of
Science
to
set
him
off
to
advantage
.
  
<EOS>
Nothing
in
this
world
could
have
co
-
operated
more
powerfully
towards
this
,
than
my
uncle
Toby
's
blue
and
gold
 
had
not
Quantity
in
some
measure
been
necessary
to
Grace
:
 
in
a
period
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
years
since
they
had
been
made
,
by
a
total
inactivity
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
life
,
for
he
seldom
went
further
than
the
bowling
-
green
 
<EOS>
his
blue
and
gold
had
become
so
miserably
too
straight
for
him
,
that
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
the
corporal
was
able
to
get
him
into
them
;
the
taking
them
up
at
the
sleeves
,
was
of
no
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
laced
however
down
the
back
,
and
at
the
seams
of
the
sides
,
&
c.
in
the
mode
of
King
William
's
reign
;
and
to
shorten
all
description
,
they
shone
so
bright
against
the
sun
that
morning
,
and
had
so
metallick
and
doughty
an
air
with
them
,
that
had
my
uncle
Toby
thought
of
attacking
in
armour
,
nothing
could
have
so
well
imposed
upon
his
imagination
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
the
thin
scarlet
breeches
,
they
had
been
unripp'd
by
the
taylor
between
the
legs
,
and
left
at
sixes
and
sevens
      
<EOS>
Yes
,
Madam
,
 
but
let
us
govern
our
fancies
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
enough
they
were
held
impracticable
the
night
before
,
and
as
there
was
no
alternative
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
wardrobe
,
he
sallied
forth
in
the
red
plush
.
  
<EOS>
The
corporal
had
array'd
<EOS>
himself
in
poor
Le
Fever
's
regimental
coat
;
and
with
his
hair
tuck'd
<EOS>
up
under
his
Montero
-
cap
,
which
he
had
furbish'd
up
for
the
occasion
,
march'd
three
paces
distant
from
his
master
:
 
a
whiff
of
military
pride
had
puff'd
out
his
shirt
at
the
wrist
;
and
upon
that
in
a
black
leather
thong
clipp'd
into
a
tassel
beyond
the
knot
,
hung
the
corporal
's
stick
 
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
carried
his
cane
like
a
pike
.
    
<EOS>
It
looks
well
at
least
;
quoth
my
father
to
himself
.
    
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
turn'd
<EOS>
his
head
more
than
once
behind
him
,
to
see
how
he
was
supported
by
the
corporal
;
and
the
corporal
as
oft
as
he
did
it
,
gave
a
slight
flourish
with
his
stick
 
but
not
vapouringly
;
and
with
the
sweetest
accent
of
most
respectful
encouragement
,
bid
his
honour
"
never
fear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Now
my
uncle
Toby
did
fear
;
and
grievously
too
;
he
knew
not
(
as
my
father
had
reproach'd
him
)
<EOS>
so
much
as
the
right
end
of
a
Woman
from
the
wrong
,
and
therefore
was
never
altogether
at
his
ease
near
any
one
of
them
 
unless
in
sorrow
or
distress
;
then
infinite
was
his
pity
;
nor
would
the
most
courteous
knight
of
romance
have
gone
further
,
at
least
upon
one
leg
,
to
have
wiped
away
a
tear
from
a
woman
's
eye
;
and
yet
excepting
once
that
he
was
beguiled
into
it
by
Mrs.
Wadman
,
he
had
never
looked
stedfastly
into
one
;
and
would
often
tell
my
father
in
the
simplicity
of
his
heart
,
that
it
was
almost
(
if
not
about
)
as
bad
as
taking
bawdy
.
      
<EOS>
And
suppose
it
is
?
<EOS>
my
father
would
say
.
    
<EOS>
She
can
not
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
halting
,
when
they
had
march'd
up
to
within
twenty
paces
of
Mrs.
Wadman
's
door
 
<EOS>
she
can
not
,
corporal
,
take
it
amiss
.
      
<EOS>
She
will
take
it
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
said
the
corporal
,
just
as
the
Jew
's
widow
at
Lisbon
took
it
of
my
brother
Tom
.
      
<EOS>
And
how
was
that
?
<EOS>
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
facing
quite
about
to
the
corporal
.
  
<EOS>
Your
honour
,
replied
the
corporal
,
knows
of
Tom
's
misfortunes
;
but
this
affair
has
nothing
to
do
with
them
any
further
than
this
,
That
if
Tom
had
not
married
the
widow
 
or
had
it
pleased
God
after
their
marriage
,
that
they
had
but
put
pork
into
their
sausages
,
the
honest
soul
had
never
been
taken
out
of
his
warm
bed
,
and
dragg'd
to
the
inquisition
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
a
cursed
place
 
added
the
corporal
,
shaking
his
head
,
 
when
once
a
poor
creature
is
in
,
he
is
in
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
very
true
;
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
looking
gravely
at
Mrs.
Wadman
's
house
,
as
he
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
Nothing
,
continued
the
corporal
,
can
be
so
sad
as
confinement
for
life
 
or
so
sweet
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
as
liberty
.
  
<EOS>
Nothing
,
Trim
 
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
musing
    
Whilst
a
man
is
free
,
 
cried
the
corporal
,
giving
a
flourish
with
his
stick
thus
    
(
squiggly
line
diagonally
across
the
page
)
  
<EOS>
A
thousand
of
my
father
's
most
subtle
syllogisms
could
not
have
said
more
for
celibacy
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
look'd
earnestly
towards
his
cottage
and
his
bowling
-
green
.
  
<EOS>
The
corporal
had
unwarily
conjured
up
the
Spirit
of
calculation
with
his
wand
;
and
he
had
nothing
to
do
,
but
to
conjure
him
down
again
with
his
story
,
and
in
this
form
of
Exorcism
,
most
un
-
ecclesiastically
did
the
corporal
do
it
.
    
<EOS>
As
Tom
's
place
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
was
easy
 
and
the
weather
warm
 
<EOS>
it
put
him
upon
thinking
seriously
of
settling
himself
in
the
world
;
and
as
it
fell
out
about
that
time
,
that
a
Jew
who
kept
a
sausage
shop
in
the
same
street
,
had
the
ill
luck
to
die
of
a
strangury
,
and
leave
his
widow
in
possession
of
a
rousing
trade
 
<EOS>
Tom
thought
(
as
every
body
in
Lisbon
was
doing
the
best
he
could
devise
for
himself
)
<EOS>
there
could
be
no
harm
in
offering
her
his
service
to
carry
it
on
:
 
so
without
any
introduction
to
the
widow
,
except
that
of
buying
a
pound
of
sausages
at
her
shop
 
<EOS>
Tom
set
out
 
counting
the
matter
thus
within
himself
,
as
he
walk'd
along
;
that
let
the
worst
come
of
it
that
could
,
he
should
at
least
get
a
pound
of
sausages
for
their
worth
 
<EOS>
but
,
if
things
went
well
,
he
should
be
set
up
;
inasmuch
as
he
should
get
not
only
a
pound
of
sausages
 
but
a
wife
and
 
a
sausage
shop
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
into
the
bargain
.
  
<EOS>
Every
servant
in
the
family
,
from
high
to
low
,
wish'd
Tom
success
;
and
I
can
fancy
,
an
'
please
your
honour
<EOS>
,
I
see
him
this
moment
with
his
white
dimity
waist
-
coat
and
breeches
,
and
hat
a
little
o
'
one
side
,
passing
jollily
along
the
street
,
swinging
his
stick
,
with
a
smile
and
a
chearful
word
for
every
body
he
met
:
 
<EOS>
But
alas
!
<EOS>
Tom
!
<EOS>
thou
smilest
no
more
,
cried
the
corporal
,
looking
on
one
side
of
him
upon
the
ground
,
as
if
he
apostrophised
him
in
his
dungeon
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
feelingly
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
an
honest
,
light
-
hearted
lad
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
as
ever
blood
<EOS>
warm'd
      
<EOS>
Then
he
resembled
thee
,
Trim
,
<EOS>
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
rapidly
.
  
<EOS>
The
corporal
blush'd
down
to
his
fingers
ends
 
a
tear
of
sentimental
bashfulness
 
another
of
gratitude
to
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
 
and
a
tear
of
sorrow
for
his
brother
's
misfortunes
,
started
into
his
eye
,
and
ran
sweetly
down
his
cheek
together
;
my
uncle
Toby
's
kindled
as
one
lamp
does
at
another
;
and
taking
hold
of
the
breast
of
Trim
's
coat
(
which
had
been
that
of
Le
Fever
's
)
as
if
to
ease
his
lame
leg
,
but
in
reality
to
gratify
a
finer
feeling
 
<EOS>
he
stood
silent
for
a
minute
and
a
half
;
at
the
end
of
which
he
took
his
hand
away
,
and
the
corporal
making
a
bow
,
went
on
with
his
story
of
his
brother
and
the
Jew
's
widow
.
    
<EOS>
When
Tom
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
got
to
the
shop
,
there
was
nobody
in
it
,
but
a
poor
negro
girl
,
with
a
bunch
of
white
feathers
slightly
tied
to
the
end
of
a
long
cane
,
flapping
away
flies
 
not
killing
them
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
a
pretty
picture
!
<EOS>
said
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
she
had
suffered
persecution
,
Trim
,
and
had
learnt
mercy
      
<EOS>
She
was
good
<EOS>
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
from
nature
,
as
well
as
from
hardships
;
and
there
are
circumstances
in
the
story
of
that
poor
friendless
slut
,
that
would
melt
a
heart
of
stone
,
said
Trim
;
and
some
dismal
winter
's
evening
,
when
your
honour
is
in
the
humour
,
they
shall
be
told
you
with
the
rest
of
Tom
's
story
,
for
it
makes
a
part
of
it
    
Then
do
not
forget
,
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
  
<EOS>
A
negro
has
a
soul
?
<EOS>
an
'
please
your
honour
,
said
the
corporal
(
doubtingly
)
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
not
much
versed
,
corporal
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
in
things
of
that
kind
;
<EOS>
but
I
suppose
,
God
would
not
leave
him
without
one
,
any
more
than
thee
or
me
      
<EOS>
It
would
be
putting
one
sadly
over
the
head
of
another
,
quoth
the
corporal
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
so
;
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
Why
then
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
is
a
black
wench
to
be
used
worse
than
a
white
one
?
  
<EOS>
I
can
give
no
reason
,
said
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
      
<EOS>
Only
,
cried
the
corporal
,
shaking
his
head
,
because
she
has
no
one
to
stand
up
for
her
      
'
Tis
<EOS>
that
very
thing
,
Trim
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
 
which
recommends
her
to
protection
 
and
her
brethren
with
her
;
'
tis
the
fortune
of
war
which
has
put
the
whip
into
our
hands
now
 
where
it
may
be
hereafter
,
heaven
knows
!
  
<EOS>
but
be
it
where
it
will
,
the
brave
,
Trim
!
<EOS>
will
not
use
it
unkindly
.
    
<EOS>
God
forbid
,
said
the
corporal
.
  
<EOS>
Amen
,
responded
my
uncle
Toby
,
laying
his
hand
upon
his
heart
.
  
<EOS>
The
corporal
returned
to
his
story
,
and
went
on
 
but
with
an
embarrassment
in
doing
it
,
which
here
and
there
a
reader
in
this
world
will
not
be
able
to
comprehend
;
for
by
the
many
sudden
transitions
all
along
,
from
one
kind
and
cordial
passion
to
another
,
in
getting
thus
far
on
his
way
,
he
had
lost
the
sportable
key
of
his
voice
,
which
gave
sense
and
spirit
to
his
tale
:
 
he
attempted
twice
to
resume
it
,
but
could
not
please
himself
;
so
giving
a
stout
hem
!
<EOS>
to
rally
back
the
retreating
spirits
,
and
aiding
nature
at
the
same
time
with
his
left
arm
a
kimbo
on
one
side
,
and
with
his
right
a
little
extended
,
supporting
her
on
the
other
 
the
corporal
got
as
near
the
note
as
he
could
;
and
in
that
attitude
,
continued
his
story
.
    
<EOS>
As
Tom
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
had
no
business
at
that
time
with
the
Moorish
girl
,
he
passed
on
into
the
room
beyond
,
to
talk
to
the
Jew
's
widow
about
love
 
and
this
pound
of
sausages
;
and
being
,
as
I
have
told
your
honour
,
an
open
cheary
-
hearted
lad
,
with
his
character
wrote
in
his
looks
and
carriage
,
he
took
a
chair
,
and
without
much
apology
,
but
with
great
civility
at
the
same
time
,
placed
it
close
to
her
at
the
table
,
and
sat
down
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
so
awkward
,
as
courting
a
woman
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
whilst
she
is
making
sausages
 
<EOS>
So
Tom
began
a
discourse
upon
them
;
first
,
gravely
,
 
"
as
how
they
were
made
 
with
what
meats
,
herbs
,
and
spices
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
a
little
gayly
,
 
as
,
"
With
what
skins
 
and
if
they
never
burst
  
Whether
the
largest
were
not
the
best
?
"
 
and
so
on
 
taking
care
only
as
he
went
along
,
to
season
what
he
had
to
say
upon
sausages
,
rather
under
than
over
;
 
that
he
might
have
room
to
act
in
    
<EOS>
It
was
owing
to
the
neglect
of
that
very
precaution
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
laying
his
hand
upon
Trim
's
shoulder
,
that
Count
De
la
Motte
lost
the
battle
of
Wynendale
:
 
he
pressed
too
speedily
into
the
wood
;
which
if
he
had
not
done
,
Lisle
had
not
fallen
into
our
hands
,
nor
Ghent
and
Bruges
,
which
both
followed
her
example
;
it
was
so
late
in
the
year
,
continued
my
uncle
Toby
,
and
so
terrible
a
season
came
on
,
that
if
things
had
not
fallen
out
as
they
did
,
our
troops
must
have
perish'd
<EOS>
in
the
open
field
.
      
<EOS>
Why
,
therefore
,
may
not
battles
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
as
well
as
marriages
,
be
made
in
heaven
?
 
<EOS>
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
mused
    
<EOS>
Religion
inclined
him
to
say
one
thing
,
and
his
high
idea
of
military
skill
tempted
him
to
say
another
;
so
not
being
able
to
frame
a
reply
exactly
to
his
mind
 
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
said
nothing
at
all
;
and
the
corporal
finished
his
story
.
  
<EOS>
As
Tom
perceived
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
that
he
gained
ground
,
and
that
all
he
had
said
upon
the
subject
of
sausages
was
kindly
taken
<EOS>
,
he
went
on
to
help
her
a
little
in
making
them
.
 
<EOS>
First
,
by
taking
hold
of
the
ring
of
the
sausage
whilst
she
stroked
the
forced
meat
down
with
her
hand
 
then
by
cutting
the
strings
into
proper
lengths
,
and
holding
them
in
his
hand
,
whilst
she
took
them
out
one
by
one
 
then
,
by
putting
them
across
her
mouth
,
that
she
might
take
them
out
as
she
wanted
them
 
<EOS>
and
so
on
from
little
to
more
<EOS>
,
till
at
last
he
adventured
to
tie
the
sausage
himself
,
whilst
she
held
the
snout
.
      
<EOS>
Now
a
widow
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
always
chuses
a
second
husband
as
unlike
the
first
as
she
can
:
 
<EOS>
so
the
affair
was
more
than
half
settled
in
her
mind
before
Tom
mentioned
it
.
  
<EOS>
She
made
a
feint
however
of
defending
herself
,
by
snatching
up
a
sausage
:
  
<EOS>
Tom
instantly
laid
hold
of
another
    
<EOS>
But
seeing
Tom
's
had
more
gristle
in
it
    
<EOS>
She
signed
the
capitulation
 
and
Tom
sealed
it
;
and
there
was
an
end
of
the
matter
.
    
<EOS>
All
womankind
,
continued
Trim
,
(
commenting
upon
his
story
)
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
love
jokes
;
the
difficulty
is
to
know
how
they
chuse
to
have
them
cut
;
and
there
is
no
knowing
that
,
but
by
trying
,
as
we
do
with
our
artillery
in
the
field
,
by
raising
or
letting
down
their
breeches
,
till
we
hit
the
mark
.
      
<EOS>
I
like
the
comparison
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
better
than
the
thing
itself
      
Because
your
honour
,
quoth
the
corporal
,
loves
glory
,
more
than
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
,
Trim
,
answered
my
uncle
Toby
,
I
love
mankind
more
than
either
;
and
as
the
knowledge
of
arms
tends
so
apparently
to
the
good
and
quiet
of
the
world
 
and
particularly
that
branch
of
it
which
we
have
practised
together
in
our
bowling
-
green
,
has
no
object
but
to
shorten
the
strides
of
Ambition
,
and
intrench
the
lives
and
fortunes
of
the
few
,
from
the
plunderings
of
the
many
 
whenever
that
drum
beats
in
our
ears
<EOS>
,
I
trust
,
corporal
,
we
shall
neither
of
us
want
so
much
humanity
and
fellow
-
feeling
,
as
to
face
about
and
march
.
  
<EOS>
In
pronouncing
this
,
my
uncle
Toby
faced
about
,
and
march'd
<EOS>
firmly
as
at
the
head
of
his
company
 
and
the
faithful
corporal
,
shouldering
his
stick
,
and
striking
his
hand
upon
his
coat
-
skirt
as
he
took
his
first
step
  
march'd
<EOS>
close
behind
him
down
the
avenue
.
    
<EOS>
Now
what
can
their
two
noddles
be
about
?
<EOS>
cried
my
father
to
my
mother
 
by
all
that
's
strange
,
they
are
besieging
Mrs.
Wadman
in
form
,
and
are
marching
round
her
house
to
mark
out
the
lines
of
circumvallation
.
  
<EOS>
I
dare
say
,
quoth
my
mother
 
<EOS>
But
stop
,
dear
Sir
 
for
what
my
mother
dared
to
say
upon
the
occasion
 
and
<EOS>
what
my
father
did
say
upon
it
 
with
her
replies
and
his
rejoinders
,
shall
be
read
,
perused
,
paraphrased
,
commented
,
and
descanted
upon
 
or
to
say
it
all
in
a
word
,
shall
be
thumb'd
over
by
Posterity
in
a
chapter
apart
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
by
Posterity
 
and
care
not
,
if
I
repeat
the
word
again
 
for
what
has
this
book
done
more
than
the
Legation
of
Moses
,
or
the
Tale
of
a
Tub
,
that
it
may
not
swim
down
the
gutter
of
Time
along
with
them
?
  
<EOS>
I
will
not
argue
the
matter
:
 
<EOS>
Time
wastes
too
fast
:
 
every
letter
I
trace
tells
me
with
what
rapidity
Life
follows
my
pen
:
 
<EOS>
the
days
and
hours
of
it
,
more
precious
,
my
dear
Jenny
!
<EOS>
than
the
rubies
about
thy
neck
,
are
flying
over
our
heads
like
light
clouds
of
a
windy
day
,
never
to
return
more
  
every
thing
presses
on
 
whilst
thou
art
twisting
that
lock
,
 
see
!
<EOS>
it
grows
grey
;
and
every
time
I
kiss
thy
hand
to
bid
adieu
,
and
every
absence
which
follows
it
,
are
preludes
to
that
eternal
separation
which
we
are
shortly
to
make
.
      
<EOS>
Heaven
have
mercy
upon
us
both
!
    
<EOS>
Now
,
for
what
the
world
thinks
of
that
ejaculation
 
I
would
not
give
a
groat
.
    
<EOS>
My
mother
had
gone
with
her
left
arm
twisted
in
my
father
's
right
,
till
they
had
got
to
the
fatal
angle
of
the
old
garden
wall
,
where
Doctor
Slop
was
overthrown
by
Obadiah
on
the
coach
-
horse
:
 
as
this
was
directly
opposite
to
the
front
of
Mrs.
Wadman
's
house
,
when
my
father
came
to
it
,
he
gave
a
look
across
;
and
seeing
my
uncle
Toby
and
the
corporal
within
ten
paces
of
the
door
,
he
turn'd
<EOS>
about
 
"
Let
us
just
stop
a
moment
,
quoth
my
father
,
and
see
with
what
ceremonies
<EOS>
my
brother
Toby
and
his
man
Trim
make
their
first
entry
 
it
will
not
detain
us
,
added
my
father
,
a
single
minute
:
"
    
No
matter
,
if
it
be
ten
minutes
,
quoth
my
mother
.
    
<EOS>
It
will
not
detain
us
half
one
;
said
my
father
.
  
<EOS>
The
corporal
was
just
then
setting
in
with
the
story
of
his
brother
Tom
and
the
Jew
's
widow
:
 
<EOS>
the
story
went
on
 
and
on
 
it
had
episodes
in
it
 
<EOS>
it
came
back
,
and
went
on
 
and
on
again
;
there
was
no
end
of
it
 
<EOS>
the
reader
found
it
very
long
      
G
..
help
my
father
!
<EOS>
he
<EOS>
pish'd
<EOS>
fifty
times
at
every
new
attitude
,
and
gave
the
corporal
's
stick
,
with
all
its
flourishings
and
danglings
,
to
as
many
devils
as
chose
to
accept
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
When
issues
of
events
like
these
my
father
is
waiting
for
,
are
hanging
in
the
scales
of
fate
,
the
mind
has
the
advantage
of
changing
the
principle
of
expectation
three
times
,
without
which
it
would
not
have
power
to
see
it
out
.
  
<EOS>
Curiosity
governs
the
first
moment
;
and
the
second
moment
is
all
oeconomy
to
justify
the
expence
of
the
first
 
and
for
the
third
,
fourth
,
fifth
,
and
sixth
moments
,
and
so
on
to
the
day
of
judgment
 
<EOS>
'
tis
a
point
of
Honour
.
  
<EOS>
I
need
not
be
told
,
that
the
ethic
writers
have
assigned
this
all
to
Patience
;
but
that
Virtue
,
methinks
,
has
extent
of
dominion
sufficient
of
her
own
,
and
enough
to
do
in
it
,
without
invading
the
few
dismantled
castles
which
Honour
has
left
him
upon
the
earth
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
stood
it
out
as
well
as
he
could
with
these
three
auxiliaries
to
the
end
of
Trim
's
story
;
and
from
thence
to
the
end
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
panegyrick
upon
arms
,
in
the
chapter
following
it
;
when
seeing
,
that
instead
of
marching
up
to
Mrs.
Wadman
's
door
,
they
both
faced
about
and
march'd
down
the
avenue
diametrically
opposite
to
his
expectation
 
he
broke
out
at
once
with
that
little
subacid
soreness
of
humour
,
which
,
in
certain
situations
,
distinguished
his
character
from
that
of
all
other
men
.
      
<EOS>
"
Now
what
can
their
two
noddles
be
about
?
"
cried
my
father
.
.
<EOS>
.&c
.
.
<EOS>
..
  
<EOS>
I
dare
say
,
said
my
mother
,
they
are
making
fortifications
      
Not
on
Mrs.
Wadman
's
premises
!
<EOS>
cried
my
father
,
stepping
back
    
<EOS>
I
suppose
not
:
 
quoth
<EOS>
my
mother
.
  
<EOS>
I
wish
,
said
my
father
,
raising
his
voice
,
the
whole
science
of
fortification
at
the
devil
,
with
all
its
trumpery
of
saps
,
mines
,
blinds
,
gabions
,
fausse
-
brays
and
cuvetts
      
<EOS>
They
are
foolish
things
 
<EOS>
said
my
mother
.
  
<EOS>
Now
she
had
a
way
,
which
,
by
the
bye
,
I
would
this
moment
give
away
my
purple
jerkin
,
and
my
yellow
slippers
into
the
bargain
,
if
some
of
your
reverences
would
imitate
 
and
that
was
,
never
to
refuse
her
assent
and
consent
to
any
proposition
my
father
laid
before
her
,
merely
because
she
did
not
understand
it
,
or
had
no
ideas
of
the
principal
word
or
term
of
art
,
upon
which
the
tenet
or
proposition
rolled
.
 
<EOS>
She
contented
herself
with
doing
all
that
her
godfathers
and
godmothers
promised
for
her
 
<EOS>
but
no
more
;
and
so
would
go
on
using
a
hard
word
twenty
years
together
 
and
replying
to
it
too
,
if
it
was
a
verb
,
in
all
its
moods
and
tenses
,
without
giving
herself
any
trouble
to
enquire
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
an
eternal
source
of
misery
to
my
father
,
and
broke
the
neck
,
at
the
first
setting
out
,
of
more
good
dialogues
between
them
,
than
could
have
done
the
most
petulant
contradiction
 
<EOS>
the
few
which
survived
were
the
better
for
the
cuvetts
      
<EOS>
"
They
are
foolish
things
;
"
said
my
mother
.
    
<EOS>
Particularly
the
cuvetts
;
replied
my
father
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
<EOS>
enough
 
<EOS>
he
tasted
the
sweet
of
triumph
 
and
went
on
.
    
<EOS>
Not
that
they
are
,
properly
speaking
,
Mrs.
Wadman
's
premises
,
said
my
father
,
partly
correcting
himself
 
because
she
is
but
tenant
for
life
      
<EOS>
That
makes
a
great
difference
 
said
my
mother
      
<EOS>
In
a
fool
's
head
,
replied
my
father
    
Unless
she
should
happen
to
have
a
child
 
<EOS>
said
my
mother
      
<EOS>
But
she
must
persuade
my
brother
Toby
first
to
get
her
one
    
To
be
sure
,
Mr.
Shandy
,
quoth
my
mother
.
    
<EOS>
Though
if
it
comes
to
persuasion
 
said
my
father
 
Lord
have
mercy
upon
them
.
  
<EOS>
Amen
:
 
said
my
mother
,
piano
.
  
<EOS>
Amen
:
 
cried
my
father
,
fortissime
.
  
<EOS>
Amen
:
 
said
my
mother
again
 
but
with
such
a
sighing
cadence
of
personal
pity
at
the
end
of
it
,
as
discomfited
every
fibre
about
my
father
 
<EOS>
he
instantly
took
out
his
almanack
;
but
before
he
could
untie
it
,
Yorick
's
congregation
coming
out
of
church
,
became
a
full
answer
to
one
half
of
his
business
with
it
 
and
my
mother
telling
him
it
was
a
sacrament
day
 
<EOS>
left
him
as
little
in
doubt
,
as
to
the
other
part
 
He
put
his
almanack
into
his
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
Lord
of
the
Treasury
thinking
of
ways
and
means
,
could
not
have
returned
home
with
a
more
embarrassed
look
.
    
<EOS>
Upon
looking
back
from
the
end
of
the
last
chapter
,
and
surveying
the
texture
of
what
has
been
wrote
,
it
is
necessary
,
that
upon
this
page
and
the
three
following
,
a
good
quantity
of
heterogeneous
matter
be
inserted
to
keep
up
that
just
balance
betwixt
wisdom
and
folly
,
without
which
a
book
would
not
hold
together
a
single
year
:
nor
is
it
a
poor
creeping
digression
(
<EOS>
which
but
for
the
name
of
,
a
man
might
continue
as
well
going
on
in
the
king
's
highway
)
<EOS>
which
will
do
the
business
 
<EOS>
no
;
if
it
is
to
be
a
digression
,
it
must
be
a
good
frisky
one
,
and
upon
a
frisky
subject
too
,
where
neither
the
horse
or
his
rider
are
to
be
caught
,
but
by
rebound
.
  
<EOS>
The
only
difficulty
,
is
raising
powers
suitable
to
the
nature
of
the
service
:
 
<EOS>
Fancy
is
capricious
 
Wit
must
not
be
searched
for
 
and
Pleasantry
(
good
-
natured
slut
as
she
is
)
will
not
come
in
at
a
call
,
was
an
empire
to
be
laid
at
her
feet
.
    
<EOS>
The
best
way
for
a
man
,
is
to
say
his
prayers
    
Only
if
it
puts
him
in
mind
of
his
infirmities
and
defects
as
well
ghostly
as
bodily
 
for
that
purpose
,
he
will
find
himself
rather
worse
after
he
has
said
them
than
before
 
for
other
purposes
,
better
.
  
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
there
is
not
a
way
either
moral
or
mechanical
under
heaven
that
I
could
think
of
,
which
I
have
not
taken
with
myself
in
this
case
:
 
sometimes
by
addressing
myself
directly
to
the
soul
herself
,
and
arguing
the
point
over
and
over
again
with
her
upon
the
extent
of
her
own
faculties
      
<EOS>
I
never
could
make
them
an
inch
the
wider
    
Then
by
changing
my
system
,
and
trying
what
could
be
made
of
it
upon
the
body
,
by
temperance
,
soberness
,
and
chastity
:
 
<EOS>
These
are
good
,
quoth
<EOS>
I
,
in
themselves
 
they
are
good
,
absolutely
;
 
they
are
good
,
relatively
;
 
they
are
good
for
health
 
<EOS>
they
are
good
for
happiness
in
this
world
 
<EOS>
they
are
good
for
happiness
in
the
next
    
<EOS>
In
short
,
they
were
good
for
every
thing
<EOS>
but
the
thing
wanted
;
and
there
they
were
good
for
nothing
,
but
to
leave
the
soul
just
as
heaven
made
it
:
 
as
for
the
theological
virtues
of
faith
and
hope
,
they
give
it
courage
;
but
then
that
snivelling
virtue
of
Meekness
(
as
my
father
would
always
call
it
)
takes
it
quite
away
again
,
so
you
are
exactly
where
you
started
.
  
<EOS>
Now
in
all
common
and
ordinary
cases
,
there
is
nothing
which
I
have
found
to
answer
so
well
as
this
      
<EOS>
Certainly
,
if
there
is
any
dependence
upon
Logic
,
and
that
I
am
not
blinded
by
self
-
love
,
there
must
be
something
of
true
genius
about
me
,
merely
upon
this
symptom
of
it
,
that
I
do
not
know
what
envy
is
:
 
for
never
do
I
hit
upon
any
invention
or
device
<EOS>
which
tendeth
to
the
furtherance
of
good
writing
,
<EOS>
but
I
instantly
make
it
public
;
willing
that
all
mankind
should
write
as
well
as
myself
.
    
<EOS>
Which
they
certainly
will
,
when
they
think
as
little
.
    
<EOS>
Now
in
ordinary
cases
,
that
is
,
when
I
am
only
stupid
,
and
the
thoughts
rise
heavily
and
pass
gummous
through
my
pen
    
Or
that
I
am
got
,
I
know
not
how
,
into
a
cold
unmetaphorical
vein
of
infamous
writing
,
and
can
not
take
a
plumb
-
lift
out
of
it
for
my
soul
;
so
must
be
obliged
to
go
on
writing
like
a
Dutch
commentator
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
,
unless
something
be
done
      
I
never
stand
conferring
with
pen
and
ink
one
moment
;
for
if
a
pinch
of
snuff
,
or
a
stride
or
two
across
the
room
will
not
do
the
business
for
me
  
<EOS>
I
take
a
razor
at
once
;
and
having
tried
the
edge
of
it
upon
the
palm
of
my
hand
,
without
further
ceremony
,
except
that
of
first
lathering
my
beard
,
I
shave
it
off
;
taking
care
only
if
I
do
leave
a
hair
,
that
it
be
not
a
grey
one
:
 
<EOS>
this
done
<EOS>
,
I
change
my
shirt
 
<EOS>
put
on
a
better
coat
 
<EOS>
send
for
my
last
wig
 
put
my
topaz
ring
upon
my
finger
;
and
in
a
word
,
dress
myself
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
me
,
after
my
best
fashion
.
  
<EOS>
Now
the
devil
in
hell
must
be
in
it
,
if
this
does
not
do
:
 
for
consider
,
Sir
,
as
every
man
chuses
to
be
present
at
the
shaving
of
his
own
beard
<EOS>
(
though
there
is
no
rule
without
an
exception
)
,
and
unavoidably
sits
over-
against
himself
the
whole
time
it
is
doing
,
<EOS>
in
case
he
has
a
hand
in
it
  
<EOS>
the
Situation
,
like
all
others
,
has
notions
of
her
own
to
put
into
the
brain
.
      
<EOS>
I
maintain
it
,
the
conceits
of
a
rough
-
bearded
man
,
are
seven
years
more
terse
and
juvenile
for
one
single
operation
;
and
if
they
did
not
run
a
risk
of
being
quite
shaved
away
,
might
be
carried
up
by
continual
shavings
,
to
the
highest
pitch
of
sublimity
 
<EOS>
How
Homer
could
write
with
so
long
a
beard
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
know
 
<EOS>
and
as
it
makes
against
my
hypothesis
,
<EOS>
I
as
little
care
 
<EOS>
But
let
us
return
to
the
Toilet
.
  
<EOS>
Ludovicus
Sorbonensis
makes
this
entirely
an
affair
of
the
body
(
Greek
)
as
he
calls
it
 
<EOS>
but
he
is
deceived
:
 
<EOS>
the
soul
and
body
are
joint
-
sharers
in
every
thing
they
get
:
 
<EOS>
A
man
can
not
dress
,
but
his
ideas
get
cloth'd
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
;
and
if
he
dresses
like
a
gentleman
,
every
one
of
them
stands
presented
to
his
imagination
,
genteelized
along
with
him
 
so
that
he
has
nothing
to
do
,
but
take
his
pen
,
and
write
like
himself
.
  
<EOS>
For
this
cause
,
when
your
honours
and
reverences
would
know
whether
I
writ
clean
and
fit
to
be
read
,
you
will
be
able
to
judge
full
as
well
by
looking
into
my
Laundress
's
bill
,
as
my
book
:
 
<EOS>
there
is
one
single
month
in
which
I
can
make
it
appear
,
that
I
dirtied
one
and
thirty
shirts
with
clean
writing
;
and
after
all
,
was
more
abus'd
,
cursed
,
criticis'd
,
and
confounded
,
and
had
more
mystic
heads
shaken
at
me
,
for
what
I
had
wrote
in
that
one
month
,
than
in
all
the
other
months
of
that
year
put
together
.
    
<EOS>
But
their
honours
and
reverences
had
not
seen
my
bills
.
    
<EOS>
As
I
never
had
any
intention
of
beginning
the
Digression
,
I
am
making
all
this
preparation
for
,
till
I
come
to
the
74th
chapter
 
<EOS>
I
have
this
chapter
to
put
to
whatever
use
<EOS>
I
think
proper
 
<EOS>
I
have
twenty
this
moment
ready
for
it
 
<EOS>
I
could
write
my
chapter
of
Button
-
holes
in
it
    
<EOS>
Or
my
chapter
of
Pishes
,
which
should
follow
them
    
<EOS>
Or
my
chapter
of
Knots
,
in
case
their
reverences
have
done
with
them
 
they
might
lead
me
into
mischief
:
 
<EOS>
the
safest
way
is
to
follow
the
track
of
the
learned
,
and
raise
objections
against
what
I
have
been
writing
,
tho
'
<EOS>
I
declare
before
-
hand
,
I
know
no
more
than
my
heels
how
to
answer
them
.
  
<EOS>
And
first
,
it
may
be
said
,
there
is
a
pelting
kind
of
thersitical
satire
,
as
black
as
the
very
ink
'
tis
wrote
with
 
(
and
by
the
bye
,
whoever
says
so
,
is
indebted
to
the
muster
-
master
general
of
the
Grecian
army
,
for
suffering
the
name
of
so
ugly
and
foul
-
mouth'd
<EOS>
a
man
as
Thersites
to
continue
upon
his
roll
 
for
it
has
furnish'd
him
with
an
epithet
)
 
in
these
productions
he
will
urge
,
all
the
personal
washings
and
scrubbings
upon
earth
do
a
sinking
genius
no
sort
of
good
 
but
just
the
contrary
,
<EOS>
inasmuch
as
the
dirtier
the
fellow
is
,
the
better
generally
he
succeeds
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
To
this
,
I
have
no
other
answer
 
<EOS>
at
least
ready
 
but
<EOS>
that
the
Archbishop
of
Benevento
wrote
his
nasty
Romance
of
the
Galatea
,
as
all
the
world
knows
,
in
a
purple
coat
,
waistcoat
,
and
purple
pair
of
breeches
;
and
that
the
penance
set
him
of
writing
a
commentary
upon
the
book
of
the
Revelations
,
as
severe
as
it
was
look'd
upon
by
one
part
of
the
world
,
was
far
from
being
deem'd
<EOS>
so
,
by
the
other
,
upon
the
single
account
of
that
Investment
.
  
<EOS>
Another
objection
,
to
all
this
remedy
,
is
its
want
of
universality
;
forasmuch
as
the
shaving
part
of
it
,
upon
which
so
much
stress
is
laid
,
by
an
unalterable
law
of
nature
<EOS>
excludes
one
half
of
the
species
entirely
from
its
use
:
 
<EOS>
all
I
can
say
is
,
that
female
writers
,
whether
of
England
,
or
of
France
,
must
e'en
go
without
it
    
<EOS>
As
for
the
Spanish
ladies
 
<EOS>
I
am
in
no
sort
of
distress
      
<EOS>
The
seventy
-
fourth
chapter
is
come
at
last
;
and
brings
nothing
with
it
but
a
sad
signature
of
"
How
our
pleasures
slip
from
under
us
in
this
world
!
"
  
<EOS>
For
in
talking
of
my
digression
 
<EOS>
I
declare
before
heaven
<EOS>
I
have
made
it
!
 
<EOS>
What
a
strange
creature
is
mortal
man
!
<EOS>
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
very
true
<EOS>
,
said
I
 
<EOS>
but
'
twere
better
to
get
all
these
things
out
of
our
heads
,
and
return
to
my
uncle
Toby
.
    
<EOS>
When
my
uncle
Toby
and
the
corporal
had
marched
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
avenue
,
they
recollected
their
business
lay
the
other
way
;
so
they
faced
about
and
marched
up
straight
to
Mrs.
Wadman
's
door
.
  
<EOS>
I
warrant
your
honour
;
said
the
corporal
,
touching
his
Montero
-
cap
with
his
hand
,
as
he
passed
him
in
order
to
give
a
knock
at
the
door
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
,
contrary
to
his
invariable
way
of
treating
his
faithful
servant
,
said
nothing
good
or
bad
:
 
<EOS>
the
truth
was
,
he
had
not
altogether
marshal'd
<EOS>
his
ideas
;
he
wish'd
for
another
conference
,
and
as
the
corporal
was
mounting
up
the
three
steps
before
the
door
 
<EOS>
he
hem'd
twice
 
a
portion
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
most
modest
spirits
fled
,
at
each
expulsion
,
towards
the
corporal
;
he
stood
with
the
rapper
of
the
door
suspended
for
a
full
minute
in
his
hand
,
he
scarce
knew
why
.
 
<EOS>
Bridget
stood
perdue
within
,
with
her
finger
and
her
thumb
upon
the
latch
,
benumb'd
with
expectation
;
and
Mrs.
Wadman
,
with
an
eye
ready
to
be
deflowered
again
,
sat
breathless
behind
the
window-
curtain
of
her
bed
-
chamber
,
watching
their
approach
.
  
<EOS>
Trim
!
<EOS>
said
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
but
as
he
articulated
the
word
,
the
minute
expired
,
and
Trim
let
fall
the
rapper
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
perceiving
that
all
hopes
of
a
conference
were
knock'd
on
the
head
by
it
 
<EOS>
whistled
Lillabullero
.
    
<EOS>
As
Mrs.
Bridget
's
finger
and
thumb
were
upon
the
latch
,
the
corporal
did
not
knock
as
often
as
perchance
your
honour
's
taylor
 
<EOS>
I
might
have
taken
my
example
something
nearer
home
;
for
I
owe
mine
,
some
five
and
twenty
pounds
at
least
,
and
wonder
at
the
man
's
patience
      
<EOS>
But
this
is
nothing
at
all
to
the
world
:
 
only
'
tis
a
cursed
thing
to
be
in
debt
;
and
there
seems
to
be
a
fatality
in
the
exchequers
of
some
poor
princes
,
particularly
those
of
our
house
,
which
no
Economy
can
bind
down
in
irons
:
 
for
my
own
part
,
I
'm
persuaded
there
is
not
any
one
prince
,
prelate
,
pope
,
or
potentate
,
great
or
small
upon
earth
,
more
desirous
in
his
heart
of
keeping
straight
with
the
world
than
I
am
 
or
who
takes
more
likely
means
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
give
above
half
a
guinea
 
or
walk
with
boots
 
or
cheapen
tooth
-
picks
 
or
lay
out
a
shilling
upon
a
band
-
box
the
year
round
;
and
for
the
six
months
I
'm
in
the
country
<EOS>
,
I
'm
upon
so
small
a
scale
,
that
with
all
the
good
temper
in
the
world
,
I
outdo
Rousseau
,
a
bar
length
 
for
I
keep
neither
man
or
boy
,
or
horse
,
or
cow
,
or
dog
,
or
cat
,
or
any
thing
that
can
eat
or
drink
,
except
a
thin
poor
piece
of
a
Vestal
(
to
keep
my
fire
in
)
,
and
who
has
generally
as
bad
an
appetite
as
myself
 
<EOS>
but
if
you
think
this
makes
a
philosopher
of
me
 
I
would
not
,
my
good
people
!
<EOS>
give
a
rush
for
your
judgments
.
  
<EOS>
True
philosophy
 
<EOS>
but
there
is
no
treating
the
subject
whilst
my
uncle
is
whistling
Lillabullero

<EOS>
Let
us
go

the

You
shall
see
the
very
place
,
Madam

said
my
uncle
Toby
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wadman
<EOS>
blush'd
 
<EOS>
look'd
<EOS>
towards
the
door
 
turn'd
pale
 
<EOS>
blush'd
slightly
again
 
recover'd
her
natural
colour
 
<EOS>
blush'd
worse
than
ever
;
which
,
for
the
sake
of
the
unlearned
reader
,
I
translate
thus
    
"
L

<EOS>
I
can
not
look
at
it
    
<EOS>
"
What
would
the
world
say
if
I
look'd
at
it
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
drop
down
,
if
I
look'd
<EOS>
at
it
    
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
look
at
it
    
<EOS>
"
There
can
be
no
sin
in
looking
at
it
.
    
<EOS>
"
I
will
look
at
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Whilst
all
this
was
running
through
Mrs.
Wadman
's
imagination
,
my
uncle
Toby
had
risen
from
the
sopha
,
and
got
to
the
other
side
of
the
parlour
door
,
to
give
Trim
an
order
about
it
in
the
passage
    
.
.
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
it
is
in
the
garret
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
 
<EOS>
I
saw
it
there
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
this
morning
,
answered
Trim
 
<EOS>
Then
prithee
,
step
directly
for
it
,
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
and
bring
it
into
the
parlour
.
  
<EOS>
The
corporal
did
not
approve
of
the
orders
,
but
most
cheerfully
obeyed
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
was
not
an
act
of
his
will
 
<EOS>
the
second
was
;
so
he
put
on
his
Montero
-
cap
,
and
went
as
fast
as
his
lame
knee
would
let
him
.
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
returned
into
the
parlour
,
and
sat
himself
down
again
upon
the
sopha
.
    
<EOS>
You
shall
lay
your
finger
upon
the
place
 
<EOS>
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
touch
it
,
however
,
quoth
Mrs.
Wadman
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
This
requires
a
second
translation
:
 
<EOS>
it
shews
what
little
knowledge
is
got
by
mere
words
 
we
must
go
up
to
the
first
springs
.
  
<EOS>
Now
in
order
to
clear
up
the
mist
which
hangs
upon
these
three
pages
,
I
must
endeavour
to
be
as
clear
as
possible
myself
.
  
<EOS>
Rub
your
hands
thrice
across
your
foreheads
 
blow
your
noses
 
cleanse
your
emunctories
 
sneeze
,
my
good
people
!

God
bless
you

Now
give
me
all
the
help

can

As
there
are
fifty
different
ends
(
counting
all
ends
in
 
as
well
civil
as
religious
)
for
which
a
woman
takes
a
husband
,
<EOS>
the
first
sets
about
and
carefully
weighs
,
then
separates
and
distinguishes
in
her
mind
,
which
of
all
that
number
of
ends
is
hers
;
then
by
discourse
,
enquiry
,
argumentation
,
and
inference
,
she
investigates
and
finds
out
whether
she
has
got
hold
of
the
right
one
 
<EOS>
and
if
she
has
 
then
,
by
pulling
it
gently
this
way
and
that
way
,
she
further
forms
a
judgment
,
whether
it
will
not
break
in
the
drawing
.
  
<EOS>
The
imagery
under
which
Slawkenbergius
impresses
this
upon
the
reader
's
fancy
,
in
the
beginning
of
his
third
Decad
,
is
so
ludicrous
,
that
the
honour
I
bear
the
sex
,
will
not
suffer
me
to
quote
it
 
<EOS>
otherwise
it
is
not
destitute
of
humour
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
first
,
saith
Slawkenbergius
,
stops
the
asse
,
and
holding
his
halter
in
her
left
hand
(
lest
he
should
get
away
)
<EOS>
she
thrusts
her
right
hand
into
the
very
bottom
of
his
pannier
to
search
for
it
 
For
what
?
 
<EOS>
you
'll
not
know
the
sooner
,
quoth
Slawkenbergius
,
for
interrupting
me
    
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
,
good
Lady
,
but
empty
bottles
;
"
says
the
asse
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
loaded
with
tripes
;
"
says
the
second
.
    
<EOS>
And
thou
art
little
better
<EOS>
,
quoth
she
to
the
third
;
for
nothing
is
there
in
thy
panniers
but
trunk
-
hose
and
pantofles
 
and
so
to
the
fourth
and
fifth
,
going
on
one
by
one
through
the
whole
string
,
till
coming
to
the
asse
which
carries
it
<EOS>
,
she
turns
the
pannier
upside
down
,
looks
at
it
  
considers
it
 
samples
it
 
<EOS>
measures
<EOS>
it
 
stretches
it
 
wets
<EOS>
it
 
dries
it
  
then
takes
her
teeth
both
to
the
warp
and
weft
of
it
.
    
<EOS>
Of
what
?
<EOS>
for
the
love
of
Christ
!
  
<EOS>
I
am
determined
,
answered
Slawkenbergius
,
that
all
the
powers
upon
earth
shall
never
wring
that
secret
from
my
breast
.
    
<EOS>
We
live
in
a
world
beset
on
all
sides
with
mysteries
and
riddles
 
<EOS>
and
so
'
tis
<EOS>
no
matter
 
else
it
seems
strange
,
that
Nature
,
who
makes
every
thing
so
well
to
answer
its
destination
,
and
seldom
or
never
errs
,
unless
for
pastime
,
in
giving
such
forms
and
aptitudes
to
whatever
passes
through
her
hands
,
that
whether
she
designs
for
the
plough
,
the
caravan
,
the
cart
 
or
whatever
other
creature
<EOS>
she
models
,
be
it
but
an
asse
's
foal
,
you
are
sure
to
have
the
thing
you
wanted
;
and
yet
at
the
same
time
should
so
eternally
bungle
it
as
she
does
,
in
making
so
simple
a
thing
as
a
married
man
.
  
<EOS>
Whether
it
is
in
the
choice
of
the
clay
 
or
that
it
is
frequently
spoiled
in
the
baking
;
by
an
excess
of
which
a
husband
may
turn
out
too
crusty
(
you
know
)
on
one
hand
 
or
not
enough
<EOS>
so
,
through
defect
of
heat
,
on
the
other
  
or
whether
this
great
Artificer
is
not
so
attentive
to
the
little
Platonic
exigences
of
that
part
of
the
species
,
for
whose
use
she
is
fabricating
this
 
or
that
her
Ladyship
sometimes
scarce
knows
what
sort
of
a
husband
will
do
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
:
 
we
will
discourse
about
it
after
supper
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
enough
,
that
neither
the
observation
itself
,
or
the
reasoning
upon
it
,
are
at
all
to
the
purpose
 
but
rather
against
it
;
since
with
regard
to
my
uncle
Toby
's
fitness
for
the
marriage
state
,
nothing
was
ever
better
:
she
had
formed
him
of
the
best
and
kindliest
clay
 
had
temper'd
<EOS>
it
with
her
own
milk
,
and
breathed
into
it
the
sweetest
spirit
 
<EOS>
she
had
made
him
all
gentle
,
generous
,
and
humane
 
she
had
filled
his
heart
with
trust
and
confidence
,
and
disposed
every
passage
which
led
to
it
,
for
the
communication
of
the
tenderest
offices
 
<EOS>
she
had
moreover
considered
the
other
causes
for
which
matrimony
was
ordained
    
And
accordingly
.

The
Donation
was
not
defeated
by
my
uncle
Toby
's
wound

<EOS>
Now
this
last
article
was
somewhat
apocryphal
;
and
the
Devil
,
who
is
the
great
disturber
of
our
faiths
in
this
world
,
had
raised
scruples
in
Mrs.
Wadman
's
brain
about
it
;
and
like
a
true
devil
as
he
was
,
had
done
his
own
work
at
the
same
time
,
by
turning
my
uncle
Toby
's
Virtue
thereupon
into
nothing
but
empty
bottles
,
tripes
,
trunk
-
hose
,
and
pantofles
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bridget
had
pawn'd
<EOS>
all
the
little
stock
of
honour
a
poor
chamber
-
maid
was
worth
in
the
world
,
that
she
would
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
affair
in
ten
days
;
and
it
was
built
upon
one
of
the
most
concessible
postulata
in
nature
:
 
namely
,
that
whilst
my
uncle
Toby
was
making
love
to
her
mistress
,
the
corporal
could
find
nothing
better
to
do
,
than
make
love
to
her
 
"
<EOS>
And
I
'll
let
him
as
much
as
he
will
,
said
Bridget
,
to
get
it
out
of
him
.

Friendship
has
two
garments
;
an
outer
and
an
under
one

<EOS>
Bridget
was
serving
her
mistress
's
interests
in
the
one
 
and
doing
the
thing
which
most
pleased
herself
in
the
other
:
 
so
had
as
many
stakes
depending
upon
my
uncle
Toby
's
wound
,
as
the
Devil
himself
 
Mrs.
Wadman
had
but
one
 
<EOS>
and
as
it
possibly
might
be
her
last
(
without
discouraging
Mrs.
Bridget
,
or
discrediting
her
talents
)
was
determined
to
play
her
cards
herself
.
  
<EOS>
She
wanted
not
encouragement
:
 
<EOS>
a
child
might
have
look'd
<EOS>
into
his
hand
  
there
was
such
a
plainness
and
simplicity
in
his
playing
out
<EOS>
what
trumps
he
had
 
with
such
an
unmistrusting
ignorance
of
the
ten
-
ace
 
and
so
naked
and
defenceless
<EOS>
did
he
sit
upon
the
same
sopha
with
widow
Wadman
,
that
a
generous
heart
would
have
wept
to
have
won
the
game
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
Let
us
drop
the
metaphor
.
      
<EOS>
And
the
story
<EOS>
too
 
if
you
please
:
 
<EOS>
for
though
I
have
all
along
been
hastening
towards
this
part
of
it
,
with
so
much
earnest
desire
,
as
well
knowing
it
to
be
the
choicest
morsel
of
what
I
had
to
offer
to
the
world
,
yet
now
that
I
am
got
to
it
,
any
one
is
welcome
to
take
my
pen
,
and
go
on
with
the
story
for
me
that
will
 
<EOS>
I
see
the
difficulties
of
the
descriptions
I
'm
going
to
give
 
and
feel
my
want
of
powers
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
one
comfort
at
least
to
me
,
that
I
lost
some
fourscore
ounces
of
blood
this
week
in
a
most
uncritical
fever
which
attacked
me
at
the
beginning
of
this
chapter
;
so
that
I
have
still
<EOS>
some
hopes
remaining
,
it
may
be
more
in
the
serous
or
globular
parts
of
the
blood
,
than
in
the
subtile
aura
of
the
brain
 
<EOS>
be
it
which
it
will
 
<EOS>
an
Invocation
can
do
no
hurt
 
<EOS>
and
I
leave
the
affair
entirely
to
the
invoked
,
to
inspire
or
to
inject
me
according
as
he
sees
good
.
  
<EOS>
The
Invocation
.
  
<EOS>
Gentle
Spirit
of
sweetest
humour
,
who
erst
did
sit
upon
the
easy
pen
of
my
beloved
Cervantes
;
Thou
who
glidedst
daily
through
his
lattice
,
and
turned'st
the
twilight
of
his
prison
into
noon
-
day
brightness
by
thy
presence
 
<EOS>
tinged'st
his
little
urn
of
water
with
heaven
-
sent
nectar
,
and
all
the
time
he
wrote
of
Sancho
and
his
master
,
didst
cast
thy
mystic
mantle
o'er
<EOS>
his
wither'd
stump
(
He
lost
his
hand
at
the
battle
of
Lepanto

,
and
wide
extended
it
to
all
the
evils
of
his
life
      
Turn
in
hither

I
beseech
thee
!
 
<EOS>
behold
these
breeches

<EOS>
they
are
all
I

in

that
piteous
rent
was
given
them
at
Lyons
    
<EOS>
My
shirts

<EOS>
see
what
a
deadly
schism
has
happen'd
amongst
'em
 
for
the
laps
are
in
Lombardy

and
the
rest
of
'em
here
 
I
never
had

six

a
cunning
gypsey
of
a
laundress
at
Milan
cut
me
off
the
fore

laps
of
five
 
<EOS>
To
do
her
justice

she
did
it

consideration

returning
out

And
yet

all
this

a

tinder

filch'd

<EOS>
I
do
not
think
a
journey
through
France
and
Italy
,
provided
a
man
keeps
his
temper
all
the
way
,
<EOS>
so
bad
a
thing
as
some
people
would
make
you
believe
:
 
there
must
be
ups
and
downs
,
or
how
the
duce
should
we
get
into
vallies
where
Nature
spreads
so
many
tables
of
entertainment
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
nonsense
to
imagine
they
will
lend
you
their
voitures
to
be
shaken
to
pieces
for
nothing
;
and
unless
you
pay
twelve
sous
for
greasing
your
wheels
,
how
should
the
poor
peasant
get
butter
to
his
bread
?
 
<EOS>
We
really
expect
too
much
 
and
for
the
livre
or
two
above
par
for
your
suppers
and
bed
 
at
the
most
they
are
but
one
shilling
and
ninepence
halfpenny
 
<EOS>
who
would
embroil
their
philosophy
for
it
?
<EOS>
for
heaven
's
and
for
your
own
sake
,
pay
it
 
pay
it
with
both
hands
open
,
rather
than
leave
Disappointment
sitting
drooping
upon
the
eye
of
your
fair
Hostess
and
her
Damsels
in
the
gate
-
way
,
<EOS>
at
your
departure
 
and
besides
,
my
dear
Sir
,
you
get
a
sisterly
kiss
of
each
of
'em
worth
a
pound
 
<EOS>
at
least
I
did
      
<EOS>
For
my
uncle
Toby
's
amours
running
all
the
way
in
my
head
,
they
had
the
same
effect
upon
me
as
if
they
had
been
my
own
 
<EOS>
I
was
in
the
most
perfect
state
of
bounty
and
good
-
will
;
and
felt
the
kindliest
harmony
vibrating
within
me
,
with
every
oscillation
of
the
chaise
alike
;
so
that
whether
the
roads
were
rough
or
smooth
<EOS>
,
it
made
no
difference
;
every
thing
I
saw
or
had
to
do
with
,
touch'd
upon
some
secret
spring
either
of
sentiment
or
rapture
.
    
<EOS>
They
were
the
sweetest
notes
I
ever
heard
;
and
I
instantly
let
down
the
fore
-
glass
to
hear
them
more
distinctly
 
'
Tis
Maria
;
said
the
postillion
,
observing
I
was
listening
 
Poor
Maria
,
continued
he
(
leaning
his
body
on
one
side
to
let
me
see
her
,
for
he
was
in
a
line
betwixt
us
)
,
is
sitting
upon
a
bank
playing
her
vespers
upon
her
pipe
,
with
her
little
goat
beside
her
.
  
<EOS>
The
young
fellow
<EOS>
utter'd
this
with
an
accent
and
a
look
so
perfectly
in
tune
to
a
feeling
heart
,
that
I
instantly
made
a
vow
,
I
would
give
him
a
four
-
and
-
twenty
sous
piece
,
when
I
got
to
Moulins
      
<EOS>
And
who
is
poor
Maria
?
<EOS>
said
I.
  
<EOS>
The
love
and
piety
of
all
the
villages
around
us
;
said
the
postillion
 
<EOS>
it
is
but
three
years
ago
,
that
the
sun
did
not
shine
upon
so
fair
,
so
quick-
witted
and
amiable
a
maid
;
and
better
fate
<EOS>
did
Maria
deserve
,
than
to
have
her
Banns
forbid
,
by
the
intrigues
of
the
curate
of
the
parish
who
published
them
    
<EOS>
He
was
going
on
,
when
Maria
,
who
had
made
a
short
pause
,
put
the
pipe
to
her
mouth
,
and
began
the
air
again
 
<EOS>
they
were
the
same
notes
;
 
yet
were
ten
times
sweeter
:
 
<EOS>
It
is
the
evening
service
to
the
Virgin
,
said
the
young
man
 
<EOS>
but
who
has
taught
her
to
play
it
 
or
how
she
came
by
her
pipe
<EOS>
,
no
one
knows
;
we
think
that
heaven
has
assisted
her
in
both
;
for
ever
since
she
has
been
unsettled
in
her
mind
,
it
seems
her
only
consolation
 
<EOS>
she
has
never
once
had
the
pipe
out
of
her
hand
,
but
plays
that
service
upon
it
almost
night
and
day
.
  
<EOS>
The
postillion
delivered
this
with
so
much
discretion
and
natural
eloquence
,
that
I
could
not
help
decyphering
something
in
his
face
above
his
condition
,
and
should
have
sifted
out
his
history
,
had
not
poor
Maria
taken
such
full
possession
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
We
had
got
up
by
this
time
almost
to
the
bank
where
Maria
was
sitting
:
she
was
in
a
thin
white
jacket
,
with
her
hair
,
all
but
two
tresses
,
drawn
up
into
a
silk
-
net
,
<EOS>
with
a
few
olive
leaves
twisted
a
little
fantastically
on
one
side
 
she
was
beautiful
;
and
if
ever
I
felt
the
full
force
of
an
honest
heart
-
ache
,
it
was
the
moment
I
saw
her
      
<EOS>
God
help
her
!
<EOS>
poor
damsel
!
<EOS>
above
a
hundred
masses
,
said
the
postillion
,
have
been
said
in
the
several
parish
churches
and
convents
around
,
for
her
,
 
but
without
effect
;
we
have
still
hopes
,
as
she
is
sensible
for
short
intervals
,
that
the
Virgin
at
last
will
restore
her
to
herself
;
but
her
parents
,
who
know
her
best
,
are
hopeless
upon
that
score
,
and
think
her
senses
are
lost
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
postillion
spoke
this
,
Maria
made
a
cadence
so
melancholy
,
so
tender
and
querulous
,
that
I
sprung
out
of
the
chaise
to
help
her
,
and
found
myself
sitting
betwixt
her
and
her
goat
before
I
relapsed
from
my
enthusiasm
.
  
<EOS>
Maria
look'd
<EOS>
wistfully
for
some
time
at
me
,
and
then
at
her
goat
 
<EOS>
and
then
at
me
 
<EOS>
and
then
at
her
goat
again
,
<EOS>
and
so
on
,
alternately
      
Well
,
Maria
,
said
I
softly
 
<EOS>
What
resemblance
do
you
find
?
  
<EOS>
I
do
entreat
the
candid
reader
to
believe
me
,
that
it
was
from
the
humblest
conviction
of
what
a
Beast
man
is
,
 
that
I
asked
the
question
;
and
that
I
would
not
have
let
fallen
an
unseasonable
pleasantry
in
the
venerable
presence
of
Misery
,
to
be
entitled
to
all
the
wit
that
ever
<EOS>
Rabelais
scatter'd
 
<EOS>
and
yet
I
own
my
heart
<EOS>
smote
me
,
and
that
I
so
smarted
at
the
very
idea
of
it
,
that
I
swore
I
would
set
up
for
Wisdom
,
and
utter
grave
sentences
the
rest
of
my
days
 
and
never
 
never
attempt
again
to
commit
mirth
with
man
,
woman
,
or
child
,
the
longest
day
I
had
to
live
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
writing
nonsense
to
them
 
<EOS>
I
believe
there
was
a
reserve
 
but
that
I
leave
to
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
Adieu
,
Maria
!
 
<EOS>
adieu
,
poor
hapless
damsel
!
 
<EOS>
some
time
,
but
not
now
,
I
may
hear
thy
sorrows
from
thy
own
lips
 
<EOS>
but
I
was
deceived
;
for
that
moment
she
took
her
pipe
and
told
me
such
a
tale
of
woe
with
it
,
that
I
rose
up
,
and
with
broken
and
irregular
steps
<EOS>
walk'd
<EOS>
softly
to
my
chaise
.
    
<EOS>
What
an
excellent
inn
at
Moulins
!
    
<EOS>
When
we
have
got
to
the
end
of
this
chapter
(
but
not
before
)
we
must
all
turn
back
to
the
two
blank
chapters
,
on
the
account
of
which
my
honour
has
lain
bleeding
<EOS>
this
half
hour
 
<EOS>
I
stop
it
,
by
pulling
off
one
of
my
yellow
slippers
and
throwing
it
with
all
my
violence
to
the
opposite
side
of
my
room
,
with
a
declaration
at
the
heel
of
it
      
<EOS>
That
whatever
resemblance
it
may
bear
to
half
the
chapters
which
are
written
in
the
world
,
or
for
aught
<EOS>
I
know
may
be
now
writing
in
it
 
that
it
was
as
casual
as
the
foam
of
Zeuxis
his
horse
;
besides
,
I
look
upon
a
chapter
which
has
only
nothing
in
it
,
with
respect
;
and
considering
what
worse
things
there
are
in
the
world
 
<EOS>
That
it
is
no
way
a
proper
subject
for
satire
      
<EOS>
Why
then
was
it
left
so
?
 
<EOS>
And
here
without
staying
for
my
reply
,
shall
I
be
called
as
many
blockheads
,
numsculs
,
doddypoles
,
dunderheads
,
ninny-
hammers
,
goosecaps
,
joltheads
,
nincompoops

and
other
unsavoury
appellations
,
as
ever
the
cake
-
bakers
of
Lerne
cast
in
the
teeth
of
King
Garangantan
's
shepherds
 
<EOS>
And
I
'll
let
them
do
it
,
as
Bridget
said
,
as
much
as
they
please
;
for
how
was
it
possible
they
should
foresee
the
necessity
I
was
under
of
writing
the
84th
chapter
of
my
book
,
before
the
77th
,
&
c
?
    
<EOS>
So
I
do
n't
take
it
<EOS>
amiss
 
<EOS>
All
I
wish
is
,
that
it
may
be
a
lesson
to
the
world
,
"
to
let
people
tell
their
stories
their
own
way

<EOS>
The
Seventy
-
seventh
Chapter
.
  
<EOS>
As
Mrs.
Bridget
opened
the
door
before
the
corporal
had
well
given
the
rap
,
the
interval
betwixt
that
and
my
uncle
Toby
's
introduction
into
the
parlour
,
was
so
short
,
that
Mrs.
Wadman
had
but
just
time
to
get
from
behind
the
curtain
 
<EOS>
lay
a
Bible
upon
the
table
,
and
advance
a
step
or
two
towards
the
door
to
receive
him
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
saluted
Mrs.
Wadman
,
after
the
manner
in
which
women
were
saluted
by
men
in
the
year
of
our
Lord
God
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
thirteen
 
then
facing
about
,
he
march'd
up
abreast
with
her
to
the
sopha
,
and
in
three
plain
words
 
though
not
before
he
was
sat
down
 
nor
after
he
was
sat
down
 
<EOS>
but
as
he
was
sitting
down
,
told
her
,
"
he
was
in
love
"
 
so
that
my
uncle
Toby
strained
himself
more
in
the
declaration
than
he
needed
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wadman
naturally
looked
down
,
upon
a
slit
she
had
been
darning
up
in
her
apron
,
in
expectation
every
moment
,
that
my
uncle
Toby
would
go
on
;
but
having
no
talents
for
amplification
,
and
Love
moreover
of
all
others
being
a
subject
of
which
<EOS>
he
was
the
least
a
master
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
told
Mrs.
Wadman
once
that
he
loved
her
,
he
let
it
alone
,
and
left
the
matter
to
work
after
its
own
way
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
was
always
in
raptures
with
this
system
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
,
as
he
falsely
called
it
,
and
would
often
say
,
that
could
his
brother
Toby
to
his
processe
have
added
but
a
pipe
of
tobacco
 
he
had
wherewithal
to
have
found
his
way
,
if
there
was
faith
in
a
Spanish
proverb
,
towards
the
hearts
of
half
the
women
upon
the
globe
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
never
understood
what
my
father
meant
;
nor
will
I
presume
to
extract
more
from
it
,
than
a
condemnation
of
an
error
which
the
bulk
of
the
world
lie
under
 
but
the
French
,
every
one
of
'em
to
a
man
,
who
believe
in
it
,
almost
as
much
as
the
Real
Presence
,
"
That
talking
of
love
,
is
making
it
.
"
    
<EOS>
I
would
as
soon
set
about
making
a
black
-
pudding
by
the
same
receipt
.
  
<EOS>
Let
us
go
on
:
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wadman
sat
in
expectation
my
uncle
Toby
would
do
so
,
to
almost
the
first
pulsation
of
that
minute
,
wherein
silence
on
one
side
or
the
other
,
generally
becomes
indecent
:
 
<EOS>
so
edging
herself
a
little
more
towards
him
,
and
raising
up
her
eyes
,
sub
blushing
,
as
she
did
it
 
<EOS>
she
took
up
the
gauntlet
 
or
the
discourse
<EOS>
(
if
you
like
it
better
)
and
communed
with
my
uncle
Toby
,
thus
:
  
The
cares
and
disquietudes
of
the
marriage
state
,
quoth
Mrs.
Wadman
,
are
very
great
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
so
 
said
my
uncle
Toby
:
 
<EOS>
and
therefore
when
a
person
,
continued
Mrs.
Wadman
,
is
so
much
at
his
ease
as
you
are
 
so
happy
,
captain
Shandy
,
in
yourself
,
your
friends
and
your
amusements
 
I
wonder
,
what
reasons
can
incline
you
to
the
state
      
<EOS>
They
are
written
,
quoth
<EOS>
my
uncle
Toby
,
in
the
Common
-
Prayer
Book
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
far
my
uncle
Toby
went
on
warily
,
and
kept
within
his
depth
,
leaving
Mrs.
Wadman
to
sail
upon
the
gulph
as
she
pleased
.
    
<EOS>
As
for
children
 
said
Mrs.
Wadman
 
though
a
principal
end
perhaps
of
the
institution
,
and
the
natural
wish
,
I
suppose
,
of
every
parent
 
yet
do
not
we
all
find
,
they
are
certain
sorrows
,
and
very
uncertain
comforts
?
<EOS>
and
what
is
there
,
dear
sir
,
to
pay
one
for
the
heart
-
achs
 
what
compensation
for
the
many
tender
and
disquieting
apprehensions
of
a
suffering
and
defenceless
mother
who
brings
them
into
life
?
 
<EOS>
I
declare
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
smit
with
pity
,
I
know
of
none
;
unless
it
be
the
pleasure
which
it
has
pleased
God
    
<EOS>
A
fiddlestick
!
<EOS>
quoth
she
.
   
<EOS>
the
Seventy
-
eighth
.
  
<EOS>
Now
there
are
such
an
infinitude
of
notes
,
tunes
,
cants
,
chants
,
airs
,
looks
,
and
accents
with
which
the
word
fiddlestick
may
be
pronounced
in
all
such
causes
as
this
,
every
one
of
'em
impressing
a
sense
and
meaning
as
different
from
the
other
,
as
dirt
from
cleanliness
 
That
Casuists
(
for
it
is
an
affair
of
conscience
on
that
score
)
<EOS>
reckon
up
no
less
than
fourteen
thousand
in
which
you
may
do
either
right
or
wrong
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wadman
hit
upon
the
fiddlestick
,
which
summoned
up
all
my
uncle
Toby
's
modest
blood
into
his
cheeks
 
so
feeling
within
himself
<EOS>
that
he
had
somehow
or
other
got
beyond
his
depth
,
he
stopt
short
;
and
without
entering
further
either
into
the
pains
or
pleasures
of
matrimony
,
he
laid
his
hand
upon
his
heart
,
and
made
an
offer
to
take
them
as
they
were
,
and
share
them
along
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
When
my
uncle
Toby
had
said
this
,
he
did
not
care
to
say
it
again
;
so
casting
his
eye
upon
the
Bible
which
Mrs.
Wadman
had
laid
upon
the
table
,
he
took
it
up
;
and
popping
,
dear
soul
!
<EOS>
upon
a
passage
in
it
,
of
all
others
the
most
interesting
to
him
 
which
was
the
siege
of
Jericho
 
<EOS>
he
set
himself
to
read
it
over
 
leaving
his
proposal
of
marriage
,
as
he
had
done
his
declaration
of
love
,
to
work
with
her
after
its
own
way
.
 
<EOS>
Now
it
wrought
neither
as
an
astringent
or
a
loosener
;
nor
like
opium
,
or
bark
,
or
mercury
,
or
buckthorn
,
or
any
one
drug
which
nature
had
bestowed
upon
the
world
 
in
short
,
it
work'd
not
at
all
in
her
;
and
the
cause
of
that
was
,
that
there
was
something
working
there
before
 
Babbler
that
I
am
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
anticipated
what
it
was
a
dozen
times
;
but
there
is
fire
still
in
the
subject
 
allons
.
    
<EOS>
It
is
natural
for
a
perfect
stranger
who
is
going
from
London
to
Edinburgh
,
to
enquire
before
he
sets
out
,
<EOS>
how
many
miles
to
York
;
which
is
about
the
half
way
 
nor
does
any
body
wonder
,
if
he
goes
on
and
asks
about
the
corporation
,
&
c.
.
<EOS>
..
  
<EOS>
It
was
just
as
natural
for
Mrs.
Wadman
,
whose
first
husband
was
all
his
time
afflicted
with
a
Sciatica
,
to
wish
to
know
how
far
from
the
hip
to
the
groin
;
and
how
far
she
was
likely
to
suffer
more
or
less
in
her
feelings
,
in
the
one
case
than
in
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
accordingly
read
Drake
's
anatomy
from
one
end
to
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
peeped
into
Wharton
upon
the
brain
,
and
borrowed
Graaf
<EOS>
(
This
must
be
a
mistake
in
Mr.
Shandy
;
for
Graaf
wrote
upon
the
pancreatick
juice
,
and
the
parts
of
generation
.
)
<EOS>
upon
the
bones
and
muscles
;
but
could
make
nothing
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
reason'd
likewise
from
her
own
powers
 
laid
down
theorems
 
<EOS>
drawn
consequences
,
and
come
to
no
conclusion
.
  
<EOS>
To
clear
up
all
,
she
had
twice
asked
Doctor
Slop
,
"
if
poor
captain
Shandy
was
ever
likely
to
recover
of
his
wound
 
?
"
    
<EOS>
He
is
recovered
,
Doctor
Slop
would
say
    
What
!
<EOS>
quite
?
  
<EOS>
Quite
:
 
<EOS>
madam
    
<EOS>
But
what
do
you
mean
by
a
recovery
?
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wadman
would
say
.
  
<EOS>
Doctor
Slop
was
the
worst
man
alive
at
definitions
;
and
so
Mrs.
Wadman
could
get
no
knowledge
:
 
in
short
,
there
was
no
way
to
extract
it
,
but
from
my
uncle
Toby
himself
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
an
accent
of
humanity
in
an
enquiry
of
this
kind
which
lulls
Suspicion
to
rest
 
<EOS>
and
I
am
half
persuaded
the
serpent
<EOS>
got
pretty
near
it
,
in
his
discourse
with
Eve
;
for
the
propensity
in
the
sex
to
be
deceived
could
not
be
so
great
,
that
she
should
have
boldness
to
hold
chat
with
the
devil
,
without
it
 
<EOS>
But
there
is
an
accent
of
humanity
 
<EOS>
how
shall
I
describe
it
?
 
<EOS>
'
tis
an
accent
which
covers
the
part
with
a
garment
,
and
gives
the
enquirer
a
right
to
be
as
particular
with
it
,
as
your
body
-
surgeon
.
  
<EOS>
"
 
Was
it
without
remission
?
    
<EOS>
"
 
Was
it
more
tolerable
in
bed
?
  
<EOS>
"
 
Could
he
lie
on
both
sides
alike
with
it
?
  
<EOS>
"
 
Was
he
able
to
mount
a
horse
?
  
<EOS>
"
 
Was
motion
bad
for
it
?
"
<EOS>
et
caetera
,
were
so
tenderly
spoke
to
,
and
so
directed
towards
my
uncle
Toby
's
heart
,
that
every
item
of
them
sunk
ten
times
deeper
into
it
than
the
evils
themselves
 
<EOS>
but
when
Mrs.
Wadman
went
round
about
by
Namur
to
get
at
my
uncle
Toby
's
groin
;
and
engaged
him
to
attack
the
point
of
the
advanced
counterscarp
,
and
pele
mele
with
the
Dutch
to
take
the
counterguard
of
St.
Roch
sword
in
hand
 
and
then
with
tender
notes
playing
upon
his
ear
,
led
him
all
bleeding
by
the
hand
out
of
the
trench
,
wiping
her
eye
,
as
he
was
carried
to
his
tent
 
Heaven
!
<EOS>
Earth
!
<EOS>
Sea
!
 
<EOS>
all
was
lifted
up
 
the
springs
of
nature
rose
above
their
levels
 
<EOS>
an
angel
of
mercy
sat
besides
him
on
the
sopha
 
his
heart
glow'd
with
fire
 
and
had
he
been
worth
a
thousand
,
he
had
lost
every
heart
of
them
to
Mrs.
Wadman
.
    
<EOS>
And
whereabouts
,
dear
sir
,
quoth
Mrs.
Wadman
,
a
little
categorically
,
did
you
receive
this
sad
blow
?
 
<EOS>
In
asking
this
question
,
Mrs.
Wadman
gave
a
slight
glance
towards
the
waistband
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
red
plush
breeches
,
expecting
naturally
,
as
the
shortest
reply
to
it
,
that
my
uncle
Toby
would
lay
his
fore
-
finger
upon
the
place
 
<EOS>
It
fell
out
otherwise
 
for
my
uncle
Toby
having
got
his
wound
before
the
gate
of
St.
Nicolas
,
in
one
of
the
traverses
of
the
trench
opposite
to
the
salient
angle
of
the
demibastion
of
St.
Roch
;
he
could
at
any
time
stick
a
pin
upon
the
identical
spot
of
ground
where
he
was
standing
when
the
stone
struck
him
:
 
this
struck
instantly
upon
my
uncle
Toby
's
sensorium
 
and
with
it
,
struck
his
large
map
of
the
town
and
citadel
of
Namur
and
its
environs
,
which
he
had
purchased
and
pasted
down
upon
a
board
,
by
the
corporal
's
aid
,
during
his
long
illness
 
it
had
lain
with
other
military
lumber
in
the
garret
ever
since
,
and
accordingly
the
corporal
was
detached
to
the
garret
to
fetch
it
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
measured
off
thirty
toises
,
with
Mrs.
Wadman
's
scissars
,
from
the
returning
angle
before
the
gate
of
St.
Nicolas
;
and
with
such
a
virgin
modesty
laid
her
finger
upon
the
place
,
that
the
goddess
of
Decency
,
if
then
in
being
 
if
not
,
'
twas
her
shade
 
shook
her
head
,
and
with
a
finger
wavering
across
her
eyes
 
forbid
her
to
explain
the
mistake
.
  
<EOS>
Unhappy
Mrs.
Wadman
!
    
<EOS>
For
nothing
can
make
this
chapter
go
off
with
spirit
but
an
apostrophe
to
thee
 
<EOS>
but
my
heart
tells
me
,
that
in
such
a
crisis
an
apostrophe
is
but
an
insult
in
disguise
,
and
ere
<EOS>
I
would
offer
one
to
a
woman
in
distress
 
<EOS>
let
the
chapter
go
to
the
devil
;
provided
any
damn'd
critic
in
keeping
will
be
but
at
the
trouble
to
take
it
with
him
.
    
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
's
Map
is
carried
down
into
the
kitchen
.
      
<EOS>
And
here
is
the
Maes
 
<EOS>
and
this
is
the
Sambre
;
said
the
corporal
,
pointing
with
his
right
hand
extended
a
little
towards
the
map
,
and
his
left
upon
Mrs.
Bridget
's
shoulder
 
but
not
the
shoulder
next
him
 
and
this
,
said
he
,
is
the
town
of
Namur
 
and
this
the
citadel
 
<EOS>
and
there
lay
the
French
 
and
here
lay
his
honour
and
myself
 
and
in
this
cursed
trench
,
Mrs.
Bridget
,
quoth
the
corporal
,
taking
her
by
the
hand
,
did
he
receive
the
wound
which
crush'd
<EOS>
him
so
miserably
here
.
 
<EOS>
In
pronouncing
which
,
he
slightly
press'd
<EOS>
the
back
of
her
hand
towards
the
part
he
felt
for
 
and
let
it
fall
.
  
<EOS>
We
thought
,
Mr.
Trim
,
it
had
been
more
in
the
middle
,
 
said
Mrs.
Bridget
    
That
would
have
undone
us
for
ever
 
<EOS>
said
the
corporal
.
    
<EOS>
And
left
my
poor
mistress
undone
too
,
said
Bridget
.
  
<EOS>
The
corporal
made
no
reply
to
the
repartee
,
but
by
giving
Mrs.
Bridget
a
kiss
.
  
<EOS>
Come
 
<EOS>
come
 
<EOS>
said
Bridget
 
holding
the
palm
of
her
left
hand
parallel
to
the
plane
of
the
horizon
,
and
sliding
the
fingers
of
the
other
over
it
,
in
a
way
which
could
not
have
been
done
,
had
there
been
the
least
wart
or
protruberance
 
'
<EOS>
Tis
<EOS>
every
syllable
of
it
false
,
cried
the
corporal
,
before
she
had
half
finished
the
sentence
      
<EOS>
I
know
it
to
be
fact
,
said
Bridget
,
from
credible
witnesses
.
    
<EOS>
Upon
my
honour
,
said
the
corporal
,
laying
his
hand
upon
his
heart
,
and
blushing
,
as
he
spoke
,
with
honest
resentment
 
<EOS>
'
tis
a
story
,
Mrs.
Bridget
,
as
false
as
hell
 
<EOS>
Not
,
said
Bridget
,
interrupting
him
,
that
either
I
or
my
mistress
care
a
halfpenny
about
it
,
whether
'
tis
so
or
no
 
only
that
when
one
is
married
,
one
would
chuse
to
have
such
a
thing
by
one
at
least
    
It
was
somewhat
unfortunate
for
Mrs.
Bridget
,
that
she
had
begun
the
attack
with
her
manual
exercise
;
for
the
corporal
instantly
.
.
..
    
<EOS>
It
was
like
the
momentary
contest
in
the
moist
eye
-
lids
of
an
April
morning
,
"
Whether
Bridget
should
laugh
or
cry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
snatch'd
up
a
rolling
-
pin
 
<EOS>
'
twas
ten
to
one
,
she
had
laugh'd
    
<EOS>
She
laid
it
down
 
<EOS>
she
cried
;
and
had
one
single
tear
of
'em
but
tasted
of
bitterness
<EOS>
,
full
sorrowful
would
the
corporal
's
heart
have
been
that
he
had
used
the
argument
;
but
the
corporal
understood
the
sex
,
a
quart
major
to
a
terce
at
least
,
better
than
my
uncle
Toby
,
and
accordingly
he
assailed
Mrs.
Bridget
after
this
manner
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
,
Mrs.
Bridget
,
said
the
corporal
,
giving
her
a
most
respectful
kiss
,
that
thou
art
good
and
modest
by
nature
,
and
art
withal
so
generous
a
girl
in
thyself
,
that
,
if
I
know
thee
rightly
,
thou
would'st
not
wound
an
insect
,
much
less
the
honour
of
so
gallant
and
worthy
a
soul
as
my
master
,
wast
thou
sure
to
be
made
a
countess
of
 
but
thou
hast
been
set
on
,
and
deluded
,
dear
Bridget
,
as
is
often
a
woman
's
case
,
"
to
please
others
more
than
themselves
 
<EOS>
"
  
Bridget
's
eyes
poured
down
at
the
sensations
the
corporal
excited
.
    
<EOS>
Tell
me
 
tell
me
,
then
,
my
dear
Bridget
,
continued
the
corporal
,
taking
hold
of
her
hand
,
which
hung
down
dead
by
her
side
,
 
and
giving
a
second
kiss
 
whose
suspicion
has
misled
thee
?
  
<EOS>
Bridget
sobb'd
<EOS>
a
sob
or
two
 
then
open'd
<EOS>
her
eyes
 
<EOS>
the
corporal
wiped
'em
with
the
bottom
of
her
apron
 
she
then
open'd
<EOS>
her
heart
and
told
him
all
.
    
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
and
the
corporal
had
gone
on
separately
with
their
operations
the
greatest
part
of
the
campaign
,
and
as
effectually
cut
off
from
all
communication
of
what
either
the
one
or
the
other
had
been
doing
,
as
if
they
had
been
separated
from
each
other
by
the
Maes
or
the
Sambre
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
,
on
his
side
,
had
presented
himself
every
afternoon
in
his
red
and
silver
,
and
blue
and
gold
alternately
,
and
sustained
an
infinity
of
attacks
in
them
,
without
knowing
them
to
be
attacks
 
and
so
had
nothing
to
communicate
    
The
corporal
,
on
his
side
,
in
taking
Bridget
,
by
it
had
gain'd
considerable
advantages
 
and
consequently
had
much
to
communicate
 
<EOS>
but
what
were
the
advantages
 
as
well
as
<EOS>
what
was
the
manner
by
which
he
had
seiz'd
them
,
required
so
nice
an
historian
,
that
the
corporal
durst
not
venture
upon
it
;
and
as
sensible
as
he
was
of
glory
,
would
rather
have
been
contented
to
have
gone
bareheaded
and
without
laurels
for
ever
,
than
torture
his
master
's
modesty
for
a
single
moment
      
Best
of
honest
and
gallant
servants
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
have
apostrophiz'd
<EOS>
thee
,
Trim
!
<EOS>
once
before
 
and
could
I
apotheosize
thee
also
(
that
is
to
say
)
with
good
company
 
I
would
do
it
without
ceremony
in
the
very
next
page
.
    
<EOS>
Now
my
uncle
Toby
had
one
evening
laid
down
his
pipe
upon
the
table
,
and
was
counting
over
to
himself
upon
his
finger
ends
(
beginning
at
his
thumb
)
<EOS>
all
Mrs.
Wadman
's
perfections
one
by
one
;
and
happening
two
or
three
times
together
,
either
by
omitting
some
,
or
counting
others
twice
over
,
to
puzzle
himself
sadly
before
he
could
get
beyond
his
middle
finger
 
Prithee
,
Trim
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
taking
up
his
pipe
again
,
 
bring
me
a
pen
and
ink
:
 
<EOS>
Trim
brought
paper
also
.
  
<EOS>
Take
a
full
sheet
 
Trim
!
<EOS>
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
making
a
sign
with
his
pipe
at
the
same
time
to
take
a
chair
and
sit
down
close
by
him
at
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
The
corporal
obeyed
 
placed
the
paper
directly
before
him
 
took
a
pen
,
and
dipp'd
it
in
the
ink
.
    
<EOS>
She
has
a
thousand
virtues
,
Trim
!
<EOS>
said
my
uncle
Toby
    
Am
I
to
set
them
down
,
an
'
please
your
honour
?
<EOS>
quoth
the
corporal
.
    
<EOS>
But
they
must
be
taken
in
their
ranks
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
;
for
of
them
all
,
Trim
,
that
which
wins
me
most
,
and
which
is
a
security
for
all
the
rest
,
is
the
compassionate
turn
and
singular
humanity
of
her
character
 
<EOS>
I
protest
,
added
my
uncle
Toby
,
looking
up
,
as
he
protested
it
,
towards
the
top
of
the
ceiling
 
<EOS>
That
was
I
her
brother
,
Trim
,
a
thousand
fold
<EOS>
,
she
could
not
make
more
constant
or
more
tender
enquiries
after
my
sufferings
  
though
now
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
The
corporal
made
no
reply
to
my
uncle
Toby
's
protestation
,
but
by
a
short
cough
 
he
dipp'd
<EOS>
the
pen
a
second
time
into
the
inkhorn
;
and
my
uncle
Toby
,
pointing
with
the
end
of
his
pipe
as
close
to
the
top
of
the
sheet
at
the
left
hand
corner
of
it
,
as
he
could
get
it
 
<EOS>
the
corporal
wrote
down
the
word
HUMANITY
.
.
<EOS>
.thus
.
  
<EOS>
Prithee
,
corporal
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
as
soon
as
Trim
had
done
it
 
how
often
does
Mrs.
Bridget
enquire
after
the
wound
on
the
cap
of
thy
knee
,
which
thou
received'st
at
the
battle
of
Landen
?
  
<EOS>
She
never
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
enquires
after
it
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
That
,
corporal
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
with

the
triumph
the
goodness
of
his

<EOS>
That
shews
<EOS>
the
difference
in
the
character
of
the
mistress
and
maid
 
had
the
fortune
of
war
allotted
the
same
mischance
to
me
,
Mrs.
Wadman
would
have
enquired
into
every
circumstance
relating
to
it
<EOS>
a
hundred
times
 
She
would
have
enquired
,
an
'

your
honour
,
ten
times
as
often
about
your
honour
's
groin
 
<EOS>
The
pain
,
Trim

is
equally
excruciating
,
 
and
Compassion
has
as
much
to
do
with
the
one
as
the
other
      
God
bless
your

<EOS>
cried
the
corporal
 
<EOS>
what
has
a
woman
's
compassion
to
do
with
a
wound
upon
the
cap
of
a
man
's
knee
?
<EOS>
had
your
honour
's
been
shot
into
ten
thousand
splinters
at
the
affair
of
Landen
,
Mrs.
Wadman
would
have
troubled
her
head
as
little
about
it
as
Bridget
;
because
,
added
the
corporal
,
lowering
his
voice
,
and
speaking
very
distinctly
,
as
he
assigned
his
reason
    
<EOS>
"
The
knee
is
such
a
distance
from
the
main
body
 
<EOS>
whereas
the
groin
,
your
honour
knows
,
is
upon
the
very
curtain
of
the
place
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
gave
a
long
whistle
 
but
in
a
note
which
could
scarce
be
heard
across
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
The
corporal
had
advanced
too
far
to
retire
 
in
three
words
he
told
the
rest
    
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
laid
down
his
pipe
as
gently
upon
the
fender
,
as
if
it
had
been
spun
from
the
unravellings
of
a
spider
's
web
      
<EOS>
Let
us
go
to
my
brother
Shandy
's
,
said
he
.
    
<EOS>
There
will
be
just
time
,
whilst
my
uncle
Toby
and
Trim
are
walking
to
my
father
's
,
to
inform
you
that
Mrs.
Wadman
had
,
some
moons
before
this
,
made
a
confident
of
my
mother
;
and
that
Mrs.
Bridget
,
who
had
the
burden
of
her
own
,
as
well
as
her
mistress
's
secret
to
carry
,
had
got
happily
delivered
of
both
to
Susannah
behind
the
garden
-
wall
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
my
mother
,
she
saw
nothing
at
all
in
it
,
to
make
the
least
bustle
about
 
but
Susannah
was
sufficient
by
herself
for
all
the
ends
and
purposes
you
could
possibly
have
,
in
exporting
a
family
secret
;
for
she
instantly
imparted
it
by
signs
to
Jonathan
 
and
Jonathan
by
tokens
to
the
cook
as
she
was
basting
a
loin
of
mutton
;
the
cook
sold
it
with
some
kitchen
-
fat
to
the
postillion
for
a
groat
,
<EOS>
who
truck'd
<EOS>
it
with
the
dairy
maid
for
something
of
about
the
same
value
 
and
though
whisper'd
in
the
hay
-
loft
,
Fame
caught
the
notes
with
her
brazen
trumpet
,
and
sounded
them
upon
the
house
-
top
 
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
not
an
old
woman
in
the
village
or
five
miles
round
,
who
did
not
understand
the
difficulties
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
siege
,
and
what
were
the
secret
articles
which
had
delayed
the
surrender
.
    
<EOS>
My
father
,
whose
way
was
to
force
every
event
in
nature
into
an
hypothesis
,
by
which
means
never
man
crucified
Truth
at
the
rate
he
did
 
had
but
just
heard
of
the
report
as
my
uncle
Toby
set
out
;
and
catching
fire
suddenly
at
the
trespass
done
his
brother
by
it
,
was
demonstrating
to
Yorick
,
notwithstanding
my
mother
<EOS>
was
sitting
by
 
not
only
,
"
That
the
devil
was
in
women
,
and
that
the
whole
of
the
affair
was
lust
;
"
but
that
every
evil
and
disorder
in
the
world
,
of
what
kind
or
nature
soever
,
from
the
first
fall
of
Adam
,
down
to
my
uncle
Toby
's
(
inclusive
)
,
was
owing
one
way
or
other
to
the
same
unruly
appetite
.
  
<EOS>
Yorick
was
just
bringing
my
father
's
hypothesis
to
some
temper
,
when
my
uncle
Toby
entering
the
room
with
marks
of
infinite
benevolence
and
forgiveness
in
his
looks
,
my
father
's
eloquence
re
-
kindled
against
the
passion
 
<EOS>
and
as
he
was
not
very
nice
in
the
choice
of
his
words
when
he
was
wroth
 
as
soon
as
my
uncle
Toby
was
seated
by
the
fire
,
and
had
filled
his
pipe
,
my
father
broke
out
in
this
manner
.
      
<EOS>
That
provision
should
be
made
for
continuing
the
race
of
so
great
,
so
exalted
and
godlike
a
Being
as
man
 
<EOS>
I
am
far
from
denying
 
but
philosophy
speaks
freely
of
every
thing
;
and
therefore
I
still
think
and
do
maintain
it
to
be
a
pity
,
that
it
should
be
done
by
means
of
a
passion
which
bends
down
the
faculties
,
and
turns
all
the
wisdom
,
contemplations
,
and
operations
of
the
soul
backwards
 
a
passion
,
my
dear
,
continued
my
father
,
addressing
himself
to
my
mother
,
which
couples
and
equals
wise
men
with
fools
,
and
makes
us
come
out
of
our
caverns
and
hiding
-
places
more
like
satyrs
and
four
-
footed
beasts
than
men
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
it
will
be
said
,
<EOS>
continued
my
father
(
availing
himself
of
the
Prolepsis
)
,
that
in
itself
,
and
simply
taken
 
like
hunger
,
or
thirst
,
or
sleep
 
'
tis
an
affair
<EOS>
neither
good
or
bad
 
or
shameful
or
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
Why
then
did
the
delicacy
of
Diogenes
and
Plato
so
recalcitrate
against
it
?
<EOS>
and
wherefore
,
when
we
go
about
to
make
and
plant
a
man
,
do
we
put
out
the
candle
?
<EOS>
and
for
what
reason
is
it
,
that
all
the
parts
thereof
 
the
congredients
 
<EOS>
the
preparations
 
<EOS>
the
instruments
,
and
whatever
serves
thereto
,
are
so
held
as
to
be
conveyed
to
a
cleanly
mind
by
no
language
,
translation
,
or
periphrasis
<EOS>
whatever
?
    
<EOS>
The
act
of
killing
and
destroying
a
man
,
continued
my
father
,
raising
his
voice
 
and
turning
to
my
uncle
<EOS>
Toby
 
<EOS>
you
see
,
is
glorious
 
and
the
weapons
by
which
we
do
it
are
honourable
 
<EOS>
We
march
with
them
upon
our
shoulders
 
<EOS>
We
strut
with
them
by
our
sides
 
<EOS>
We
gild
them
 
<EOS>
We
carve
them
 
<EOS>
We
in
-
lay
them
  
<EOS>
We
enrich
them
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
if
it
be
but
a
scoundrel
cannon
,
we
cast
an
ornament
upon
the
breach
of
it
.
      
<EOS>
My
uncle
Toby
laid
down
his
pipe
to
intercede
for
a
better
epithet
 
and
Yorick
was
rising
up
to
batter
the
whole
hypothesis
to
pieces
      
When
Obadiah
broke
into
the
middle
of
the
room
with
a
complaint
,
which
cried
out
for
an
immediate
hearing
.
  
<EOS>
The
case
was
this
:
  
My
father
,
whether
by
ancient
custom
of
the
manor
,
or
as
impropriator
of
the
great
tythes
,
was
obliged
to
keep
a
Bull
for
the
service
of
the
Parish
,
and
Obadiah
had
led
his
cow
upon
a
pop
-
visit
to
him
one
day
or
other
the
preceding
summer
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
one
day
or
other
 
because
as
chance
would
have
it
,
it
was
the
day
on
which
he
was
married
to
my
father
's
house
-
maid
 
<EOS>
so
one
was
a
reckoning
to
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
when
Obadiah
's
wife
was
brought
to
bed
 
Obadiah
thanked
God
      
Now
,
said
Obadiah
,
I
shall
have
a
calf
<EOS>
:
 
<EOS>
so
Obadiah
went
daily
to
visit
his
cow
.
  
<EOS>
She
'll
calve
on
Monday
 
on
Tuesday
 
on
Wednesday
at
the
farthest
    
<EOS>
The
cow
did
not
calve
 
<EOS>
no
 
<EOS>
she
'll
not
calve
till
next
week
 
the
cow
put
it
off
terribly
 
till
at
the
end
of
the
sixth
week
<EOS>
Obadiah
's
suspicions
(
like
a
good
man
's
)
fell
upon
the
Bull
.
  
<EOS>
Now
the
parish
being
very
large
,
my
father
's
Bull
,
to
speak
the
truth
of
him
,
was
no
way
equal
to
the
department
;
he
had
,
however
,
got
himself
,
somehow
or
other
,
thrust
into
employment
 
and
as
he
went
through
the
business
with
a
grave
face
<EOS>
,
my
father
had
a
high
opinion
of
him
.
    
<EOS>
Most
of
the
townsmen
,
an
'
please
your
worship
,
quoth
Obadiah
,
believe
that
'
tis
all
the
Bull
's
fault
      
But
may
not
a
cow
be
barren
?
replied
my
father
,
turning
to
Doctor
Slop
.
  
<EOS>
It
never
happens
:
 
said
Dr.
Slop
,
but
the
man
's
wife
may
have
come
before
her
time
naturally
enough
 
<EOS>
Prithee
has
the
child
hair
upon
his
head
?
 
<EOS>
added
<EOS>
Dr.
Slop
      
It
is
as
hairy
as
I
am
;
said
Obadiah
.
 
<EOS>
Obadiah
had
not
been
shaved
for
three
weeks
 
Wheu

.cried
my
father
;
beginning
the
sentence
with
an
exclamatory
whistle
 
and
so
,
brother
Toby
,
this
poor
Bull
of
mine
,
who
is
as
good
a
Bull
as
ever

ss'd
,
and
might
have
done
for
Europa
herself
in
purer
times
 
had
he
but
two
legs
less
,
might
have
been
driven
into
Doctors
Commons
and
lost
his
character
 
which
to
a
Town
Bull
,
brother
Toby
,
is
the
very
same
thing
as
his
