Let
thy

be
of

There
,

mid
the

hurrying
desires
 
<EOS>
That
trample
on
the

to
seize
their

,
 
Lurks
vengeance
,
footless
,
irresistible
 
<EOS>
As
exhalations

And

Men
can
do
nothing
without
the
make
-
believe
of
a
beginning
.
<EOS>
Even
    
science
,
the
strict
measurer
,
is
obliged
to
start
with
a
make
-
believe
    
unit
,
and
must
fix
on
a
point
in
the

'
unceasing
journey
when
his
    
sidereal

pretend
that

<EOS>
His
less
accurate
    
grandmother
Poetry
has
always
been
understood
to
start
in
the
middle
;
    
but
on
reflection
it
appears
that
her
proceeding
is
not
very
different
    
from
his
;
since
Science
,
too
,
reckons
backward
as
well
as
forward
,
    
divides
his
unit
into
billions
,
and
with
his
clock
-
finger
at
Nought
    
really
sets
off
_

<EOS>
No
retrospect
will
take
us
to
    
the
true
beginning
;
and
whether
our
prologue
be
in
heaven
or
on
earth
,
    
it
is
but
a
fraction
of
that
all
-
presupposing
fact
with
which
our
    
story
sets
out
.
   
<EOS>
Was
she
beautiful
or
not
beautiful
?
<EOS>
and
what
was
the
secret
of
form
or
expression
which
gave
the
dynamic
quality
to
her
glance
?
<EOS>
Was
the
good
or
the
evil
genius
dominant
in
those
beams
?
<EOS>
Probably
the
evil
;
else
why
was
the
effect
that
of
unrest
rather
than
of
undisturbed
charm
?
<EOS>
Why
was
the
wish
to
look
again
felt
as
coercion
and
not
as
a
longing
in
which
the
whole
being
consents
?
  
<EOS>
She
who
raised
these
questions
in
Daniel
Deronda
's
mind
was
occupied
in
gambling
:
not
in
the
open
air
under
a
southern
sky
,
tossing
coppers
on
a
ruined
wall
,
with
rags
about
her
limbs
;
but
in
one
of
those
splendid
resorts
which
the
enlightenment
of
ages
has
prepared
for
the
same
species
of
pleasure
at
a
heavy
cost
of
gilt
mouldings
,
dark
-
toned
color
and
chubby
nudities
,
all
correspondingly
heavy
 
forming
a
suitable
condenser
for
human
breath
belonging
,
in
great
part
,
to
the
highest
fashion
,
and
not
easily
procurable
to
be
breathed
in
elsewhere
in
the
like
proportion
,
at
least
by
persons
of
little
fashion
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
near
four
o'clock
on
a
September
day
,
so
that
the
atmosphere
was
well
-
brewed
to
a
visible
haze
.
<EOS>
There
was
deep
stillness
,
broken
only
by
a
light
rattle
,
a
light
chink
,
a
small
sweeping
sound
,
and
an
occasional
monotone
in
French
,
such
as
might
be
expected
to
issue
from
an
ingeniously
constructed
automaton
.
<EOS>
Round
two
long
tables
were
gathered
two
serried
crowds
of
human
beings
,
all
save
one
having
their
faces
and
attention
bent
on
the
tables
.
<EOS>
The
one
exception
was
a
melancholy
little
boy
,
with
his
knees
and
calves
simply
in
their
natural
clothing
of
epidermis
,
but
for
the
rest
of
his
person
in
a
fancy
dress
.
<EOS>
He
alone
had
his
face
turned
toward
the
doorway
,
and
fixing
on
it
the
blank
gaze
of
a
bedizened
child
stationed
as
a
masquerading
advertisement
on
the
platform
of
an
itinerant
show
,
stood
close
behind
a
lady
deeply
engaged
at
the
roulette
-
table
.
  
<EOS>
About
this
table
fifty
or
sixty
persons
were
assembled
,
many
in
the
outer
rows
,
where
there
was
occasionally
a
deposit
of
new
-
comers
,
being
mere
spectators
,
only
that
one
of
them
,
usually
a
woman
,
might
now
and
then
be
observed
putting
down
a
five
-
franc
with
a
simpering
air
,
just
to
see
what
the
passion
of
gambling
really
was
.
<EOS>
Those
who
were
taking
their
pleasure
at
a
higher
strength
,
and
were
absorbed
in
play
,
showed
very
distant
varieties
of
European
type
:
Livonian
and
Spanish
,
Graeco
-
Italian
and
miscellaneous
German
,
English
aristocratic
and
English
plebeian
.
<EOS>
Here
certainly
was
a
striking
admission
of
human
equality
.
<EOS>
The
white
bejewelled
fingers
of
an
English
countess
were
very
near
touching
a
bony
,
yellow
,
crab
-
like
hand
stretching
a
bared
wrist
to
clutch
a
heap
of
coin
 
a
hand
easy
to
sort
with
the
square
,
gaunt
face
,
deep
-
set
eyes
,
grizzled
eyebrows
,
and
ill
-
combed
scanty
hair
which
seemed
a
slight
metamorphosis
of
the
vulture
.
<EOS>
And
where
else
would
her
ladyship
have
graciously
consented
to
sit
by
that
dry
-
lipped
feminine
figure
prematurely
old
,
withered
after
short
bloom
like
her
artificial
flowers
,
holding
a
shabby
velvet
reticule
before
her
,
and
occasionally
putting
in
her
mouth
the
point
with
which
she
pricked
her
card
?
<EOS>
There
too
,
very
near
the
fair
countess
,
was
a
respectable
London
tradesman
,
blonde
and
soft
-
handed
,
his
sleek
hair
scrupulously
parted
behind
and
before
,
conscious
of
circulars
addressed
to
the
nobility
and
gentry
,
whose
distinguished
patronage
enabled
him
to
take
his
holidays
fashionably
,
and
to
a
certain
extent
in
their
distinguished
company
.
<EOS>
Not
his
gambler
's
passion
that
nullifies
appetite
,
but
a
well
-
fed
leisure
,
which
,
in
the
intervals
of
winning
money
in
business
and
spending
it
showily
,
sees
no
better
resource
than
winning
money
in
play
and
spending
it
yet
more
showily
 
reflecting
always
that
Providence
had
never
manifested
any
disapprobation
of
his
amusement
,
and
dispassionate
enough
to
leave
off
if
the
sweetness
of
winning
much
and
seeing
others
lose
had
turned
to
the
sourness
of
losing
much
and
seeing
others
win
.
<EOS>
For
the
vice
of
gambling
lay
in
losing
money
at
it
.
<EOS>
In
his
bearing
there
might
be
something
of
the
tradesman
,
but
in
his
pleasures
he
was
fit
to
rank
with
the
owners
of
the
oldest
titles
.
<EOS>
Standing
close
to
his
chair
was
a
handsome
Italian
,
calm
,
statuesque
,
reaching
across
him
to
place
the
first
pile
of
napoleons
from
a
new
bagful
<EOS>
just
brought
him
by
an
envoy
with
a
scrolled
mustache
.
<EOS>
The
pile
was
in
half
a
minute
pushed
over
to
an
old
bewigged
woman
with
eye
-
glasses
pinching
her
nose
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
slight
gleam
,
a
faint
mumbling
smile
about
the
lips
of
the
old
woman
;
but
the
statuesque
Italian
remained
impassive
,
and
 
probably
secure
in
an
infallible
system
which
placed
his
foot
on
the
neck
of
chance
 
immediately
prepared
a
new
pile
.
<EOS>
So
did
a
man
with
the
air
of
an
emaciated
beau
or
worn
-
out
libertine
,
who
looked
at
life
through
one
eye
-
glass
,
and
held
out
his
hand
tremulously
when
he
asked
for
change
.
<EOS>
It
could
surely
be
no
severity
of
system
,
but
rather
some
dream
of
white
crows
,
or
the
induction
that
the
eighth
of
the
month
was
lucky
,
which
inspired
the
fierce
yet
tottering
impulsiveness
of
his
play
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
while
every
single
player
differed
markedly
from
every
other
,
there
was
a
certain
uniform
negativeness
of
expression
which
had
the
effect
of
a
mask
 
as
if
they
had
all
eaten
of
some
root
that
for
the
time
compelled
the
brains
of
each
to
the
same
narrow
monotony
of
action
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
's
first
thought
when
his
eyes
fell
on
this
scene
of
dull
,
gas
-
poisoned
absorption
,
was
that
the
gambling
of
Spanish
shepherd
<EOS>
-
boys
had
seemed
to
him
more
enviable
:
 
so
far
Rousseau
might
be
justified
in
maintaining
that
art
and
science
had
done
a
poor
service
to
mankind
.
<EOS>
But
suddenly
he
felt
the
moment
become
dramatic
.
<EOS>
His
attention
was
arrested
by
a
young
lady
who
,
standing
at
an
angle
not
far
from
him
,
was
the
last
to
whom
his
eyes
traveled
.
<EOS>
She
was
bending
and
speaking
English
to
a
middle
-
aged
lady
seated
at
play
beside
her
:
but
the
next
instant
she
returned
to
her
play
,
and
showed
the
full
height
of
a
graceful
figure
,
with
a
face
which
might
possibly
be
looked
at
without
admiration
,
but
could
hardly
be
passed
with
indifference
.
  
<EOS>
The
inward
debate
which
she
raised
in
Deronda
gave
to
his
eyes
a
growing
expression
of
scrutiny
,
tending
farther
and
farther
away
from
the
glow
of
mingled
undefined
sensibilities
forming
admiration
.
<EOS>
At
one
moment
they
followed
the
movements
of
the
figure
,
of
the
arms
and
hands
,
as
this
problematic
sylph
bent
forward
to
deposit
her
stake
with
an
air
of
firm
choice
;
and
the
next
they
returned
to
the
face
which
,
at
present
unaffected
by
beholders
,
was
directed
steadily
toward
the
game
.
<EOS>
The
sylph
was
a
winner
;
and
as
her
taper
fingers
,
delicately
gloved
in
pale
-
gray
,
were
adjusting
the
coins
which
had
been
pushed
toward
her
in
order
to
pass
them
back
again
to
the
winning
point
,
she
looked
round
her
with
a
survey
too
markedly
cold
and
neutral
not
to
have
in
it
a
little
of
that
nature
which
we
call
art
concealing
an
inward
exultation
.
  
<EOS>
But
in
the
course
of
that
survey
her
eyes
met
Deronda
's
,
and
instead
of
averting
them
as
she
would
have
desired
to
do
,
she
was
unpleasantly
conscious
that
they
were
arrested
 
how
long
?
<EOS>
The
darting
sense
that
he
was
measuring
her
and
looking
down
on
her
as
an
inferior
,
that
he
was
of
different
quality
from
the
human
dross
around
her
,
that
he
felt
himself
in
a
region
outside
and
above
her
,
and
was
examining
her
as
a
specimen
of
a
lower
order
,
roused
a
tingling
resentment
which
stretched
the
moment
with
conflict
.
<EOS>
It
did
not
bring
the
blood
to
her
cheeks
,
but
it
sent
it
away
from
her
lips
.
<EOS>
She
controlled
herself
by
the
help
of
an
inward
defiance
,
and
without
other
sign
of
emotion
than
this
lip
-
paleness
turned
to
her
play
.
<EOS>
But
Deronda
's
gaze
seemed
to
have
acted
as
an
evil
eye
.
<EOS>
Her
stake
was
gone
.
<EOS>
No
matter
;
she
had
been
winning
ever
since
she
took
to
roulette
with
a
few
napoleons
at
command
,
and
had
a
considerable
reserve
.
<EOS>
She
had
begun
to
believe
in
her
luck
,
others
had
begun
to
believe
in
it
:
she
had
visions
of
being
followed
by
a
_
cortège
_
who
would
worship
her
as
a
goddess
of
luck
and
watch
her
play
as
a
directing
augury
.
<EOS>
Such
things
had
been
known
of
male
gamblers
;
why
should
not
a
woman
have
a
like
supremacy
?
<EOS>
Her
friend
and
chaperon
who
had
not
wished
her
to
play
at
first
was
beginning
to
approve
,
only
administering
the
prudent
advice
to
stop
at
the
right
moment
and
carry
money
back
to
England
 
advice
to
which
Gwendolen
had
replied
that
she
cared
for
the
excitement
of
play
,
not
the
winnings
.
<EOS>
On
that
supposition
the
present
moment
ought
to
have
made
the
flood
-
tide
in
her
eager
experience
of
gambling
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
when
her
next
stake
was
swept
away
,
she
felt
the
orbits
of
her
eyes
getting
hot
,
and
the
certainty
she
had
(
without
looking
)
of
that
man
still
watching
her
was
something
like
a
pressure
which
begins
to
be
torturing
.
<EOS>
The
more
reason
to
her
why
she
should
not
flinch
,
but
go
on
playing
as
if
she
were
indifferent
to
loss
or
gain
.
<EOS>
Her
friend
touched
her
elbow
and
proposed
that
they
should
quit
the
table
.
<EOS>
For
reply
Gwendolen
put
ten
louis
on
the
same
spot
:
she
was
in
that
mood
of
defiance
in
which
the
mind
loses
sight
of
any
end
beyond
the
satisfaction
of
enraged
resistance
;
and
with
the
puerile
stupidity
of
a
dominant
impulse
includes
luck
among
its
objects
of
defiance
.
<EOS>
Since
she
was
not
winning
strikingly
,
the
next
best
thing
was
to
lose
strikingly
.
<EOS>
She
controlled
her
muscles
,
and
showed
no
tremor
of
mouth
or
hands
.
<EOS>
Each
time
her
stake
was
swept
off
<EOS>
she
doubled
it
.
<EOS>
Many
were
now
watching
her
,
but
the
sole
observation
she
was
conscious
of
was
Deronda
's
,
who
,
though
she
never
looked
toward
him
,
she
was
sure
had
not
moved
away
.
<EOS>
Such
a
drama
takes
no
long
while
to
play
out
:
development
and
catastrophe
can
often
be
measured
by
nothing
clumsier
than
the
moment
-
hand
.
"
<EOS>
Faites
votre
jeu
,
mesdames
et
messieurs
,
"
said
the
automatic
voice
of
destiny
from
between
the
mustache
and
imperial
of
the
croupier
:
and
Gwendolen
's
arm
was
stretched
to
deposit
her
last
poor
heap
of
napoleons
.
"
<EOS>
Le
jeu
<EOS>
ne
va
<EOS>
plus
,
"
said
destiny
.
<EOS>
And
in
five
seconds
Gwendolen
turned
from
the
table
,
but
turned
resolutely
with
her
face
toward
Deronda
and
looked
at
him
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
smile
of
irony
in
his
eyes
as
their
glances
met
;
but
it
was
at
least
better
that
he
should
have
disregarded
her
as
one
of
an
insect
swarm
who
had
no
individual
physiognomy
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
in
spite
of
his
superciliousness
and
irony
,
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
he
did
not
admire
her
spirit
as
well
as
her
person
:
<EOS>
he
was
young
,
handsome
,
distinguished
in
appearance
 
not
one
of
these
ridiculous
and
dowdy
Philistines
who
thought
it
incumbent
on
them
to
blight
the
gaming
-
table
with
a
sour
look
of
protest
as
they
passed
by
it
.
<EOS>
The
general
conviction
that
we
are
admirable
does
not
easily
give
way
before
a
single
negative
;
rather
when
any
of
Vanity
's
large
family
,
male
or
female
,
find
their
performance
received
coldly
,
they
are
apt
to
believe
that
a
little
more
of
it
will
win
over
the
unaccountable
dissident
.
<EOS>
In
Gwendolen
's
habits
of
mind
it
had
been
taken
for
granted
that
she
knew
what
was
admirable
and
that
she
herself
was
admired
.
<EOS>
This
basis
of
her
thinking
had
received
a
disagreeable
concussion
,
and
reeled
a
little
,
but
was
not
easily
to
be
overthrown
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
evening
the
same
room
was
more
stiflingly
heated
,
was
brilliant
with
gas
and
with
the
costumes
of
ladies
who
floated
their
trains
along
it
or
were
seated
on
the
ottomans
.
  
<EOS>
The
Nereid
in
sea
-
green
robes
and
silver
ornaments
,
with
a
pale
sea
-
green
feather
fastened
in
silver
falling
backward
over
her
green
hat
and
light
brown
hair
,
was
Gwendolen
Harleth
.
<EOS>
She
was
under
the
wing
,
or
rather
soared
by
the
shoulder
,
of
the
lady
who
had
sat
by
her
at
the
roulette
-
table
;
and
with
them
was
a
gentleman
with
a
white
mustache
and
clipped
hair
:
solid
-
browed
,
stiff
and
German
.
<EOS>
They
were
walking
about
or
standing
to
chat
with
acquaintances
,
and
Gwendolen
was
much
observed
by
the
seated
groups
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
striking
girl
 
that
Miss
Harleth
 
unlike
others
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
she
has
got
herself
up
as
a
sort
of
serpent
now
 
all
green
and
silver
,
and
winds
her
neck
about
a
little
more
than
usual
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
she
must
always
be
doing
something
extraordinary
.
<EOS>
She
is
that
kind
of
girl
,
I
fancy
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
her
pretty
,
Mr.
Vandernoodt
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Very
.
A
man
might
risk
hanging
for
her
 
<EOS>
I
mean
a
fool
might
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
like
a
_
nez
retroussé
_
,
then
,
and
long
narrow
eyes
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
they
go
with
such
an
_
ensemble
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
_
ensemble
du
serpent
_
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
you
will
.
<EOS>
Woman
was
tempted
by
a
serpent
;
why
not
man
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
certainly
very
graceful
;
but
she
wants
a
tinge
of
color
in
her
cheeks
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
sort
of
Lamia
beauty
she
has
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
the
contrary
,
I
think
her
complexion
one
of
her
chief
charms
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
warm
paleness
;
it
looks
thoroughly
healthy
.
<EOS>
And
that
delicate
nose
with
its
gradual
little
upward
curve
is
distracting
.
<EOS>
And
then
her
mouth
 
there
never
was
a
prettier
mouth
,
the
lips
curled
backward
so
finely
,
eh
,
Mackworth
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Think
so
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
endure
that
sort
of
mouth
.
<EOS>
It
looks
so
self
-
complacent
,
as
if
it
knew
its
own
beauty
 
<EOS>
the
curves
are
too
immovable
.
<EOS>
I
like
a
mouth
that
trembles
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
my
part
,
I
think
her
odious
,
"
said
a
dowager
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
wonderful
what
unpleasant
girls
get
into
vogue
.
<EOS>
Who
are
these
Langens
?
<EOS>
Does
anybody
know
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
quite
_
comme
il
faut
_
.
<EOS>
I
have
dined
with
them
several
times
at
the
_
Russie
_
.
<EOS>
The
baroness
is
English
.
<EOS>
Miss
Harleth
calls
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
The
girl
herself
is
thoroughly
well
-
bred
,
and
as
clever
as
possible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
<EOS>
and
the
baron
?
"
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
very
good
furniture
picture
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
baroness
is
always
at
the
roulette
-
table
,
"
said
Mackworth
.
<EOS>
"
I
fancy
she
has
taught
the
girl
to
gamble
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
the
old
woman
plays
a
very
sober
game
;
drops
a
ten
-
franc
piece
here
and
there
.
<EOS>
The
girl
is
more
headlong
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
only
a
freak
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hear
she
has
lost
all
her
winnings
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Are
they
rich
?
<EOS>
Who
knows
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ah
,
who
knows
?
<EOS>
Who
knows
that
about
anybody
?
"
said
Mr.
Vandernoodt
,
moving
off
to
join
the
Langens
.
  
<EOS>
The
remark
that
Gwendolen
wound
her
neck
about
more
than
usual
this
evening
was
true
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
that
she
might
carry
out
the
serpent
idea
more
completely
:
it
was
that
she
watched
for
any
chance
of
seeing
Deronda
,
so
that
she
might
inquire
about
this
stranger
,
under
whose
measuring
gaze
<EOS>
she
was
still
wincing
.
<EOS>
At
last
her
opportunity
came
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Vandernoodt
,
you
know
everybody
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
not
too
eagerly
,
rather
with
a
certain
languor
of
utterance
which
she
sometimes
gave
to
her
clear
soprano
.
<EOS>
"
Who
is
that
near
the
door
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
are
half
a
dozen
near
the
door
.
<EOS>
Do
you
mean
that
old
Adonis
in
the
George
the
Fourth
wig
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
;
the
dark
-
haired
young
man
on
the
right
with
the
dreadful
expression
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dreadful
,
do
you
call
it
?
<EOS>
I
think
he
is
an
uncommonly
fine
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
who
is
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
lately
come
to
our
hotel
with
Sir
Hugo
Mallinger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
Hugo
Mallinger
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
<EOS>
(
Gwendolen
colored
slightly
.
)
<EOS>
"
He
has
a
place
near
us
,
but
he
never
comes
to
it
.
<EOS>
What
did
you
say
was
the
name
of
that
gentleman
near
the
door
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Deronda
 
Mr.
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
What
a
delightful
name
!
<EOS>
Is
he
an
Englishman
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
He
is
reported
to
be
rather
closely
related
to
the
baronet
.
<EOS>
You
are
interested
in
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
is
not
like
young
men
in
general
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
do
n't
admire
young
men
in
general
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
I
always
know
what
they
will
say
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
at
all
guess
what
this
Mr.
Deronda
would
say
.
<EOS>
What
_
does
_
<EOS>
he
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nothing
,
chiefly
.
<EOS>
I
sat
with
his
party
for
a
good
hour
last
night
on
the
terrace
,
and
he
never
spoke
 
and
was
not
smoking
either
.
<EOS>
He
looked
bored
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Another
reason
why
I
should
like
to
know
him
.
<EOS>
I
am
always
bored
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
he
would
be
charmed
to
have
an
introduction
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
bring
it
about
?
<EOS>
Will
you
allow
it
,
baroness
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
 
since
he
is
related
to
Sir
Hugo
Mallinger
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
new
_
rôle
_
of
yours
,
Gwendolen
,
to
be
always
bored
,
"
continued
Madame
von
Langen
,
when
Mr.
Vandernoodt
had
moved
away
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Until
now
you
have
always
seemed
eager
about
something
from
morning
till
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
just
because
I
am
bored
to
death
.
<EOS>
If
I
am
to
leave
off
play
I
must
break
my
arm
or
my
collar
-
bone
.
<EOS>
I
must
make
something
happen
;
unless
you
will
go
into
Switzerland
and
take
me
up
the
Matterhorn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
this
Mr.
Deronda
's
acquaintance
will
do
instead
of
the
Matterhorn
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Perhaps
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
Gwendolen
did
not
make
Deronda
's
acquaintance
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Vandernoodt
did
not
succeed
in
bringing
him
up
to
her
that
evening
,
and
when
she
re
-
entered
her
own
room
she
found
a
letter
recalling
her
home
.
      
<EOS>
This
man
contrives
a
secret
'
<EOS>
twixt
us
two
,
  
<EOS>
That
he
may
quell
me
with
his
meeting
eyes
  
<EOS>
Like
one
who
quells
a
lioness
at
bay
.
   
<EOS>
This
was
the
letter
Gwendolen
found
on
her
table
:
        
DEAREST
CHILD
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
expecting
to
hear
from
you
for
a
week
.
<EOS>
In
    
your
last
you
said
the
Langens
thought
of
leaving
Leubronn
and
going
    
to
Baden
.
<EOS>
How
could
you
be
so
thoughtless
as
to
leave
me
in
    
uncertainty
about
your
address
?
<EOS>
I
am
in
the
greatest
anxiety
lest
this
    
should
not
reach
you
.
<EOS>
In
any
case
,
you
were
to
come
home
at
the
end
of
    
September
,
and
I
must
now
entreat
you
to
return
as
quickly
as
    
possible
,
for
if
you
spent
all
your
money
it
would
be
out
of
my
power
    
to
send
you
any
more
,
and
you
must
not
borrow
of
the
Langens
,
for
I
    
could
not
repay
them
.
<EOS>
This
is
the
sad
truth
,
my
child
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
    
prepare
you
for
it
better
 
but
<EOS>
a
dreadful
calamity
has
befallen
us
    
all
.
<EOS>
You
know
nothing
about
business
and
will
not
understand
it
;
but
    
Grapnell
&
Co.
have
failed
for
a
million
,
and
we
are
totally
    
ruined
 
your
aunt
Gascoigne
as
well
as
I
,
only
that
your
uncle
has
his
    
benefice
,
so
that
by
putting
down
their
carriage
and
getting
interest
    
for
the
boys
,
the
family
can
go
on
.
<EOS>
All
the
property
our
poor
father
    
saved
for
us
goes
to
pay
the
liabilities
.
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
I
can
call
    
my
own
.
<EOS>
It
is
better
you
should
know
this
at
once
,
though
it
rends
my
    
heart
to
have
to
tell
it
you
.
<EOS>
Of
course
we
can
not
help
thinking
what
a
    
pity
it
was
that
you
went
away
just
when
you
did
.
<EOS>
But
I
shall
never
    
reproach
you
,
my
dear
child
;
I
would
save
you
from
all
trouble
if
I
    
could
.
<EOS>
On
your
way
home
you
will
have
time
to
prepare
yourself
for
the
    
change
you
will
find
.
<EOS>
We
shall
perhaps
leave
Offendene
at
once
,
for
we
    
hope
that
Mr.
Haynes
,
who
wanted
it
before
,
may
be
ready
to
take
it
    
off
my
hands
.
<EOS>
Of
course
we
can
not
go
to
the
rectory
 
<EOS>
there
is
not
a
    
corner
there
to
spare
.
<EOS>
We
must
get
some
hut
or
other
to
shelter
us
,
    
and
<EOS>
we
must
live
on
your
uncle
Gascoigne
's
charity
,
until
I
see
what
    
else
can
be
done
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
be
able
to
pay
the
debts
to
the
    
tradesmen
besides
the
servants
'
wages
.
<EOS>
Summon
up
your
fortitude
,
my
    
dear
child
;
we
must
resign
ourselves
to
God
's
will
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
hard
to
    
resign
one
's
self
to
Mr.
Lassman
's
wicked
recklessness
,
which
they
say
    
was
the
cause
of
the
failure
.
<EOS>
Your
poor
sisters
can
only
cry
with
me
    
and
give
me
no
help
.
<EOS>
If
you
were
once
here
,
there
might
be
a
break
in
    
the
cloud
 
<EOS>
I
always
feel
it
impossible
that
you
can
have
been
meant
    
for
poverty
.
<EOS>
If
the
Langens
wish
to
remain
abroad
,
perhaps
you
can
put
    
yourself
under
some
one
else
's
care
for
the
journey
.
<EOS>
But
come
as
soon
    
as
you
can
to
your
afflicted
and
loving
mamma
,
      
FANNY
DAVILOW
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
effect
of
this
letter
on
Gwendolen
was
half
-
stupefying
.
<EOS>
The
implicit
confidence
that
her
destiny
must
be
one
of
luxurious
ease
,
where
any
trouble
that
occurred
would
be
well
clad
and
provided
for
,
had
been
stronger
in
her
own
mind
than
in
her
mamma
's
,
being
fed
there
by
her
youthful
blood
and
that
sense
of
superior
claims
which
made
a
large
part
of
her
consciousness
.
<EOS>
It
was
almost
as
difficult
for
her
to
believe
suddenly
that
her
position
had
become
one
of
poverty
and
of
humiliating
dependence
,
as
it
would
have
been
to
get
into
the
strong
current
of
her
blooming
life
the
chill
sense
that
her
death
would
really
come
.
<EOS>
She
stood
motionless
for
a
few
minutes
,
then
tossed
off
her
hat
and
automatically
looked
in
the
glass
.
<EOS>
The
coils
of
her
smooth
light
-
brown
hair
were
still
in
order
perfect
enough
for
a
ball
-
room
;
and
as
on
other
nights
,
Gwendolen
might
have
looked
lingeringly
at
herself
for
pleasure
(
surely
an
allowable
indulgence
)
;
but
now
she
took
no
conscious
note
of
her
reflected
beauty
,
and
simply
stared
right
before
her
as
if
she
had
been
jarred
by
a
hateful
sound
and
was
waiting
for
any
sign
of
its
cause
.
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
she
threw
herself
in
the
corner
of
the
red
velvet
sofa
,
took
up
the
letter
again
and
read
it
twice
deliberately
,
letting
it
at
last
fall
on
the
ground
,
while
she
rested
her
clasped
hands
on
her
lap
and
sat
perfectly
still
,
shedding
no
tears
.
<EOS>
Her
impulse
was
to
survey
and
resist
the
situation
rather
than
to
wail
over
it
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
inward
exclamation
of
"
Poor
mamma
!
"
<EOS>
Her
mamma
had
never
seemed
to
get
much
enjoyment
out
of
life
,
and
if
Gwendolen
had
been
at
this
moment
disposed
to
feel
pity
she
would
have
bestowed
it
on
herself
 
for
<EOS>
was
she
not
naturally
and
rightfully
the
chief
object
of
her
mamma
's
anxiety
too
?
<EOS>
But
it
was
anger
,
it
was
resistance
that
possessed
her
;
it
was
bitter
vexation
that
she
had
lost
her
gains
at
roulette
,
whereas
if
her
luck
had
continued
through
this
one
day
she
would
have
had
a
handsome
sum
to
carry
home
,
or
she
might
have
gone
on
playing
and
won
enough
to
support
them
all
.
<EOS>
Even
now
was
it
not
possible
?
<EOS>
She
had
only
four
napoleons
left
in
her
purse
,
but
she
possessed
some
ornaments
which
she
could
sell
:
a
practice
so
common
in
stylish
society
at
German
baths
that
there
was
no
need
to
be
ashamed
of
it
;
and
even
if
she
had
not
received
her
mamma
's
letter
,
she
would
probably
have
decided
to
get
money
for
an
Etruscan
necklace
which
she
happened
not
to
have
been
wearing
since
her
arrival
;
nay
,
she
might
have
done
so
with
an
agreeable
sense
that
she
was
living
with
some
intensity
and
escaping
humdrum
.
<EOS>
With
ten
louis
at
her
disposal
and
a
return
of
her
former
luck
,
which
seemed
probable
,
what
could
she
do
better
than
go
on
playing
for
a
few
days
?
<EOS>
If
her
friends
at
home
disapproved
of
the
way
in
which
she
got
the
money
,
as
they
certainly
would
,
still
the
money
would
be
there
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
imagination
dwelt
on
this
course
and
created
agreeable
consequences
,
but
not
with
unbroken
confidence
and
rising
certainty
as
it
would
have
done
if
she
had
been
touched
with
the
gambler
's
mania
.
<EOS>
She
had
gone
to
the
roulette
-
table
not
because
of
passion
,
but
in
search
of
it
:
her
mind
was
still
sanely
capable
of
picturing
balanced
probabilities
,
and
while
the
chance
of
winning
allured
her
,
the
chance
of
losing
thrust
itself
on
her
with
alternate
strength
and
made
a
vision
from
which
her
pride
sank
sensitively
.
<EOS>
For
she
was
resolved
not
to
tell
the
Langens
that
any
misfortune
had
befallen
her
family
,
or
to
make
herself
in
any
way
indebted
to
their
compassion
;
and
if
she
were
to
part
with
her
jewelry
to
any
observable
extent
,
they
would
interfere
by
inquiries
and
remonstrances
.
<EOS>
The
course
that
held
the
least
risk
of
intolerable
annoyance
was
to
raise
money
on
her
necklace
early
in
the
morning
,
tell
the
Langens
that
her
mother
desired
her
immediate
return
without
giving
a
reason
,
and
take
the
train
for
Brussels
that
evening
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
maid
with
her
,
and
the
Langens
might
make
difficulties
about
her
returning
home
,
but
her
will
was
peremptory
.
  
<EOS>
Instead
of
going
to
bed
she
made
as
brilliant
a
light
as
she
could
and
began
to
pack
,
working
diligently
,
though
all
the
while
visited
by
the
scenes
that
might
take
place
on
the
coming
day
 
now
by
the
tiresome
explanations
and
farewells
,
and
the
whirling
journey
toward
a
changed
home
,
now
by
the
alternative
of
staying
just
another
day
and
standing
again
at
the
roulette
-
table
.
<EOS>
But
always
in
this
latter
scene
there
was
the
presence
of
that
Deronda
,
watching
her
with
exasperating
irony
,
and
 
the
two
keen
experiences
were
inevitably
revived
together
 
beholding
her
again
forsaken
by
luck
.
<EOS>
This
importunate
image
certainly
helped
to
sway
her
resolve
on
the
side
of
immediate
departure
,
and
to
urge
her
packing
to
the
point
which
would
make
a
change
of
mind
inconvenient
.
<EOS>
It
had
struck
twelve
when
she
came
into
her
room
,
and
by
the
time
she
was
assuring
herself
that
she
had
left
out
only
what
was
necessary
,
the
faint
dawn
was
stealing
through
the
white
blinds
and
dulling
her
candles
.
<EOS>
What
was
the
use
of
going
to
bed
?
<EOS>
Her
cold
bath
was
refreshment
enough
,
and
she
saw
that
a
slight
trace
of
fatigue
about
the
eyes
only
made
her
look
the
more
interesting
.
<EOS>
Before
six
o'clock
she
was
completely
equipped
in
her
gray
traveling
dress
even
to
her
felt
hat
,
for
she
meant
to
walk
out
as
soon
as
she
could
count
on
seeing
other
ladies
on
their
way
to
the
springs
.
<EOS>
And
happening
to
be
seated
sideways
before
the
long
strip
of
mirror
between
her
two
windows
she
turned
to
look
at
herself
,
leaning
her
elbow
on
the
back
of
the
chair
in
an
attitude
that
might
have
been
chosen
for
her
portrait
.
<EOS>
It
is
possible
to
have
a
strong
self
-
love
without
any
self
-
satisfaction
,
rather
with
a
self
-
discontent
which
is
the
more
intense
because
one
's
own
little
core
of
egoistic
sensibility
is
a
supreme
care
;
but
Gwendolen
knew
nothing
of
such
inward
strife
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
_
naïve
_
delight
in
her
fortunate
self
,
which
any
but
the
harshest
saintliness
will
have
some
indulgence
for
in
a
girl
who
had
every
day
seen
a
pleasant
reflection
of
that
self
in
her
friends
'
flattery
as
well
as
in
the
looking
-
glass
.
<EOS>
And
even
in
this
beginning
of
troubles
,
while
for
lack
of
anything
else
to
do
she
sat
gazing
at
her
image
in
the
growing
light
,
her
face
gathered
a
complacency
gradual
as
the
cheerfulness
of
the
morning
.
<EOS>
Her
beautiful
lips
curled
into
a
more
and
more
decided
smile
,
till
at
last
she
took
off
her
hat
,
leaned
forward
and
kissed
the
cold
glass
which
had
looked
so
warm
.
<EOS>
How
could
she
believe
in
sorrow
?
<EOS>
If
it
attacked
her
,
she
felt
the
force
to
crush
it
,
to
defy
it
,
or
run
away
from
it
,
as
she
had
done
already
.
<EOS>
Anything
seemed
more
possible
than
that
she
could
go
on
bearing
miseries
,
great
or
small
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
von
Langen
never
went
out
before
breakfast
,
so
that
Gwendolen
could
safely
end
her
early
walk
by
taking
her
way
homeward
through
the
Obere
Strasse
in
which
was
the
needed
shop
,
sure
to
be
open
after
seven
.
<EOS>
At
that
hour
any
observers
whom
she
minded
would
be
either
on
their
walks
in
the
region
of
the
springs
,
or
would
be
still
in
their
bedrooms
;
but
certainly
there
was
one
grand
hotel
,
the
_
<EOS>
Czarina
_
from
which
eyes
might
follow
her
up
to
Mr.
Wiener
's
door
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
chance
to
be
risked
:
might
she
not
be
going
in
to
buy
something
which
had
struck
her
fancy
?
<EOS>
This
implicit
falsehood
passed
through
her
mind
as
she
remembered
that
the
_
<EOS>
Czarina
_
was
Deronda
's
hotel
;
but
she
was
then
already
far
up
the
Obere
Strasse
,
and
she
walked
on
with
her
usual
floating
movement
,
every
line
in
her
figure
and
drapery
falling
in
gentle
curves
attractive
to
all
eyes
except
those
which
discerned
in
them
too
close
a
resemblance
to
the
serpent
,
and
objected
to
the
revival
of
serpent
-
worship
.
<EOS>
She
looked
neither
to
the
right
hand
nor
to
the
left
,
and
transacted
her
business
in
the
shop
with
a
coolness
which
gave
little
Mr.
Weiner
nothing
to
remark
except
her
proud
grace
of
manner
,
and
the
superior
size
and
quality
of
the
three
central
turquoises
in
the
necklace
she
offered
him
.
<EOS>
They
had
belonged
to
a
chain
once
her
father
's
:
but
she
had
never
known
her
father
;
and
the
necklace
was
in
all
respects
the
ornament
she
could
most
conveniently
part
with
.
<EOS>
Who
supposes
that
it
is
an
impossible
contradiction
to
be
superstitious
and
rationalizing
at
the
same
time
?
<EOS>
Roulette
encourages
a
romantic
superstition
as
to
the
chances
of
the
game
,
and
the
most
prosaic
rationalism
as
to
human
sentiments
which
stand
in
the
way
of
raising
needful
money
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
dominant
regret
was
that
after
all
she
had
only
nine
louis
to
add
to
the
four
in
her
purse
:
these
Jew
dealers
were
so
unscrupulous
in
taking
advantage
of
Christians
unfortunate
at
play
!
<EOS>
But
she
was
the
Langens
'
guest
in
their
hired
apartment
,
and
had
nothing
to
pay
there
:
thirteen
louis
would
do
more
than
take
her
home
;
even
if
she
determined
on
risking
three
,
the
remaining
ten
would
more
than
suffice
,
since
she
meant
to
travel
right
on
,
day
and
night
.
<EOS>
As
she
turned
homeward
,
nay
,
entered
and
seated
herself
in
the
_
salon
_
to
await
her
friends
and
breakfast
,
she
still
wavered
as
to
her
immediate
departure
,
or
<EOS>
rather
she
had
concluded
to
tell
the
Langens
simply
that
she
had
had
a
letter
from
her
mamma
desiring
her
return
,
and
to
leave
it
still
undecided
when
she
should
start
.
<EOS>
It
was
already
the
usual
breakfast
-
time
,
and
hearing
some
one
enter
as
she
was
leaning
back
rather
tired
and
hungry
with
her
eyes
<EOS>
shut
,
she
rose
expecting
to
see
one
or
other
of
the
Langens
 
<EOS>
the
words
which
might
determine
her
lingering
at
least
another
day
,
ready
-
formed
to
pass
her
lips
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
the
servant
bringing
in
a
small
packet
for
Miss
Harleth
,
which
had
at
that
moment
been
left
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
took
it
in
her
hand
and
immediately
hurried
into
her
own
room
.
<EOS>
She
looked
paler
and
more
agitated
than
when
she
had
first
read
her
mamma
's
letter
.
<EOS>
Something
 
<EOS>
she
never
quite
knew
what
 
revealed
to
her
before
she
opened
the
packet
that
it
contained
the
necklace
she
had
just
parted
with
.
<EOS>
Underneath
the
paper
it
was
wrapped
in
a
cambric
handkerchief
,
and
within
this
was
a
scrap
of
torn
-
off
note
-
paper
,
on
which
was
written
with
a
pencil
,
in
clear
but
rapid
handwriting
 
"
_
A
stranger
who
has
found
Miss
Harleth
's
necklace
returns
it
to
her
with
the
hope
that
she
will
not
again
risk
the
loss
of
it
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
"
  
Gwendolen
reddened
with
the
vexation
of
wounded
pride
.
<EOS>
A
large
corner
of
the
handkerchief
seemed
to
have
been
recklessly
torn
off
to
get
rid
of
a
mark
;
but
she
at
once
believed
in
the
first
image
of
"
the
stranger
"
that
presented
itself
to
her
mind
.
<EOS>
It
was
Deronda
;
he
must
have
seen
her
go
into
the
shop
;
he
must
have
gone
in
immediately
after
and
repurchased
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
He
had
taken
an
unpardonable
liberty
,
and
had
dared
to
place
her
in
a
thoroughly
hateful
position
.
<EOS>
What
could
she
do
?
 
<EOS>
Not
,
assuredly
,
act
on
her
conviction
that
it
was
he
who
had
sent
her
the
necklace
and
straightway
<EOS>
send
it
back
to
him
<EOS>
:
that
would
be
to
face
the
possibility
that
she
had
been
mistaken
;
nay
,
even
if
the
"
stranger
"
were
he
and
no
other
,
it
would
be
something
too
gross
for
her
to
let
him
know
that
she
had
divined
this
,
and
to
meet
him
again
with
that
recognition
in
their
minds
.
<EOS>
He
knew
very
well
that
he
was
entangling
her
in
helpless
humiliation
:
it
was
another
way
of
smiling
at
her
ironically
,
and
taking
the
air
of
a
supercilious
mentor
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
felt
the
bitter
tears
of
mortification
rising
and
rolling
down
her
cheeks
.
<EOS>
No
one
had
ever
before
dared
to
treat
her
with
irony
and
contempt
.
<EOS>
One
thing
was
clear
:
she
must
carry
out
her
resolution
to
quit
this
place
at
once
;
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
reappear
in
the
public
_
salon
_
,
still
less
stand
at
the
gaming
-
table
with
the
risk
of
seeing
Deronda
.
<EOS>
Now
came
an
importunate
knock
at
the
door
:
breakfast
was
ready
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
with
a
passionate
movement
thrust
necklace
,
cambric
,
scrap
of
paper
,
and
all
into
her
_
nécessaire
_
,
pressed
her
handkerchief
against
her
face
,
and
after
pausing
a
minute
or
two
to
summon
back
her
proud
self
-
control
,
went
to
join
her
friends
.
<EOS>
Such
signs
of
tears
and
fatigue
as
were
left
seemed
accordant
enough
with
the
account
she
at
once
gave
of
her
having
sat
up
to
do
her
packing
,
instead
of
waiting
for
help
from
her
friend
's
maid
.
<EOS>
There
was
much
protestation
,
as
she
had
expected
,
against
her
traveling
alone
,
but
she
persisted
in
refusing
any
arrangements
for
companionship
.
<EOS>
She
would
be
put
into
the
ladies
'
compartment
and
go
right
on
.
<EOS>
She
could
rest
exceedingly
well
in
the
train
,
and
was
afraid
of
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
way
it
happened
that
Gwendolen
never
reappeared
at
the
roulette
-
table
,
but
that
Thursday
evening
left
Leubronn
for
Brussels
,
and
on
Saturday
morning
arrived
at
Offendene
,
the
home
to
which
she
and
her
family
were
soon
to
say
a
last
good
-
bye
.

Pity
that
Offendene
was
not
the
home
of
Miss
Harleth
's
childhood
,
or
endeared
to
her
by
family
memories
!
<EOS>
A
human
life
,
I
think
,
should
be
well
rooted
in
some
spot
of
a
native
land
,
where
it
may
get
the
love
of
tender
kinship
for
the
face
of
earth
,
for
the
labors
men
go
forth
to
,
for
the
sounds
and
accents
that
haunt
it
,
for
whatever
will
give
that
early
home
a
familiar
unmistakable
difference
amid
the
future
widening
of
knowledge
:
a
spot
where
the
definiteness
of
early
memories
may
be
inwrought
with
affection
,
and
 
kindly
acquaintance
with
all
neighbors
,
even
to
the
dogs
and
donkeys
,
may
spread
not
by
sentimental
effort
and
reflection
,
but
as
a
sweet
habit
of
the
blood
.

At
five
years
old
,
mortals
are
not
prepared
to
be
citizens
of
the
world
,
to
be
stimulated
by
abstract
nouns
,
to
soar
above
preference
into
impartiality
;
and
that
prejudice
in
favor
of
milk
with
which
we
blindly
begin
,
is
a
type
of
the
way
body
and
soul
must
get
nourished
at
least
for
a
time
.
<EOS>
The
best
introduction
to
astronomy
is
to
think
of
the
nightly
heavens
as
a
little
lot
of
stars
belonging
to
one
's
own
homestead
.
  
<EOS>
But
this
blessed
persistence
in
which
affection
can
take
root
had
been
wanting
in
Gwendolen
's
life
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
a
year
before
her
recall
from
Leubronn
that
Offendene
had
been
chosen
as
her
mamma
's
home
,
simply
for
its
nearness
to
Pennicote
Rectory
,
and
that
Mrs.
Davilow
,
Gwendolen
,
and
her
four
half
-
sisters
(
the
governess
and
the
maid
following
in
another
vehicle
)
had
been
driven
along
the
avenue
for
the
first
time
,
on
a
late
October
afternoon
when
the
rooks
were
crawing
loudly
above
them
,
and
the
yellow
elm
-
leaves
were
whirling
.
  
<EOS>
The
season
suited
the
aspect
of
the
old
oblong
red
-
brick
house
,
rather
too
anxiously
ornamented
with
stone
at
every
line
,
not
excepting
the
double
row
of
narrow
windows
and
the
large
square
portico
.
<EOS>
The
stone
encouraged
a
greenish
lichen
,
the
brick
a
powdery
gray
,
so
that
though
the
building
was
rigidly
rectangular
there
was
no
harshness
in
the
physiognomy
which
it
turned
to
the
three
avenues
cut
east
,
west
and
south
in
the
hundred
yards
'
breadth
of
old
plantation
encircling
the
immediate
grounds
.
<EOS>
One
would
have
liked
the
house
to
have
been
lifted
on
a
knoll
,
so
as
to
look
beyond
its
own
little
domain
to
the
long
thatched
roofs
of
the
distant
villages
,
the
church
towers
,
the
scattered
homesteads
,
the
gradual
rise
of
surging
woods
,
and
the
green
breadths
of
undulating
park
which
made
the
beautiful
face
of
the
earth
in
that
part
of
Wessex
.
<EOS>
But
though
standing
thus
behind
,
a
screen
amid
flat
pastures
,
it
had
on
one
side
a
glimpse
of
the
wider
world
in
the
lofty
curves
of
the
chalk
downs
,
grand
steadfast
forms
played
over
by
the
changing
days
.
  
<EOS>
The
house
was
but
just
large
enough
to
be
called
a
mansion
,
and
was
moderately
rented
,
having
no
manor
attached
to
it
,
and
being
rather
difficult
to
let
with
its
sombre
furniture
and
faded
upholstery
.
<EOS>
But
inside
and
outside
it
was
what
no
beholder
could
suppose
to
be
inhabited
by
retired
trades
-
people
:
a
certainty
which
was
worth
many
conveniences
to
tenants
who
not
only
had
the
taste
that
shrinks
from
new
finery
,
but
also
were
in
that
border
-
territory
of
rank
where
annexation
is
a
burning
topic
:
and
to
take
up
her
abode
in
a
house
which
had
once
sufficed
for
dowager
countesses
gave
a
perceptible
tinge
to
Mrs.
Davilow
's
satisfaction
in
having
an
establishment
of
her
own
.
<EOS>
This
,
rather
mysteriously
to
Gwendolen
,
appeared
suddenly
possible
on
the
death
of
her
step
-
father
,
Captain
Davilow
,
who
had
for
the
last
nine
years
joined
his
family
only
in
a
brief
and
fitful
manner
,
enough
to
reconcile
them
to
his
long
absences
;
but
she
cared
much
more
for
the
fact
than
for
the
explanation
.
<EOS>
All
her
prospects
had
become
more
agreeable
in
consequence
.
<EOS>
She
had
disliked
their
former
way
of
life
,
roving
from
one
foreign
watering
-
place
or
Parisian
apartment
to
another
,
always
feeling
new
antipathies
to
new
suites
of
hired
furniture
,
and
meeting
new
people
under
conditions
which
made
her
appear
of
little
importance
;
and
the
variation
of
having
passed
two
years
at
a
showy
school
,
where
,
on
all
occasions
of
display
,
she
had
been
put
foremost
,
had
only
deepened
her
sense
that
so
exceptional
a
person
as
herself
could
hardly
remain
in
ordinary
circumstances
or
in
a
social
position
less
than
advantageous
.
<EOS>
Any
fear
of
this
latter
evil
was
banished
now
that
her
mamma
was
to
have
an
establishment
;
for
on
the
point
of
birth
Gwendolen
was
quite
easy
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
notion
how
her
maternal
grandfather
got
the
fortune
inherited
by
his
two
daughters
;
but
he
had
been
a
West
Indian
 
which
seemed
to
exclude
further
question
;
and
she
knew
that
her
father
's
family
was
so
high
as
to
take
no
notice
of
her
mamma
,
who
nevertheless
preserved
with
much
pride
the
miniature
of
a
Lady
Molly
in
that
connection
.
<EOS>
She
would
probably
have
known
much
more
about
her
father
but
for
a
little
incident
which
happened
when
she
was
twelve
years
old
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
had
brought
out
,
as
she
did
only
at
wide
intervals
,
various
memorials
of
her
first
husband
,
and
while
showing
his
miniature
to
Gwendolen
recalled
with
a
fervor
which
seemed
to
count
on
a
peculiar
filial
sympathy
,
the
fact
that
dear
papa
had
died
when
his
little
daughter
was
in
long
clothes
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
immediately
thinking
of
the
unlovable
step
-
father
whom
she
had
been
acquainted
with
the
greater
part
of
her
life
while
her
frocks
were
short
,
said
    
"
Why
did
you
marry
again
,
mamma
?
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
nicer
if
you
had
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
colored
deeply
,
a
slight
convulsive
movement
passed
over
her
face
,
and
straightway
shutting
up
the
memorials
she
said
,
with
a
violence
quite
unusual
in
her
    
"
You
have
no
feeling
,
child
!
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
who
was
fond
of
her
mamma
,
felt
hurt
and
ashamed
,
and
had
never
since
dared
to
ask
a
question
about
her
father
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
not
the
only
instance
in
which
she
had
brought
on
herself
the
pain
of
some
filial
compunction
.
<EOS>
It
was
always
arranged
,
when
possible
,
that
she
should
have
a
small
bed
in
her
mamma
's
room
;
for
Mrs.
Davilow
's
motherly
tenderness
clung
chiefly
to
her
eldest
girl
,
who
had
been
born
in
her
happier
time
.
<EOS>
One
night
under
an
attack
of
pain
she
found
that
the
specific
regularly
placed
by
her
bedside
had
been
forgotten
,
and
begged
Gwendolen
to
get
out
of
bed
and
reach
it
for
her
.
<EOS>
That
healthy
young
lady
,
snug
and
warm
as
a
rosy
infant
in
her
little
couch
,
objected
to
step
out
into
the
cold
,
and
lying
perfectly
still
,
grumbling
a
refusal
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
went
without
the
medicine
and
never
reproached
her
daughter
;
but
the
next
day
Gwendolen
was
keenly
conscious
of
what
must
be
in
her
mamma
's
mind
,
and
tried
to
make
amends
by
caresses
which
cost
her
no
effort
.
<EOS>
Having
always
been
the
pet
and
pride
of
the
household
,
waited
on
by
mother
,
sisters
,
governess
and
maids
,
as
if
she
had
been
a
princess
in
exile
,
she
naturally
found
it
difficult
to
think
her
own
pleasure
less
important
than
others
made
it
,
and
when
it
was
positively
thwarted
felt
an
astonished
resentment
apt
,
in
her
cruder
days
,
to
vent
itself
in
one
of
those
passionate
acts
which
look
like
a
contradiction
of
habitual
tendencies
.
<EOS>
Though
never
even
as
a
child
thoughtlessly
cruel
,
nay
delighting
to
rescue
drowning
insects
and
watch
their
recovery
,
there
was
a
disagreeable
silent
remembrance
of
her
having
strangled
her
sister
's
canary
-
bird
in
a
final
fit
of
exasperation
at
its
shrill
singing
which
had
again
and
again
jarringly
interrupted
her
own
.
<EOS>
She
had
taken
pains
to
buy
a
white
mouse
for
her
sister
in
retribution
,
and
though
inwardly
excusing
herself
on
the
ground
of
a
peculiar
sensitiveness
which
was
a
mark
of
her
general
superiority
,
the
thought
of
that
infelonious
murder
had
always
made
her
wince
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
nature
was
not
remorseless
,
but
she
liked
to
make
her
penances
easy
,
and
now
that
she
was
twenty
and
more
,
some
of
her
native
force
had
turned
into
a
self
-
control
by
which
she
guarded
herself
from
penitential
humiliation
.
<EOS>
There
was
more
show
of
fire
and
will
in
her
than
ever
,
but
there
was
more
calculation
underneath
it
.
  
<EOS>
On
this
day
of
arrival
at
Offendene
,
which
not
even
Mrs.
Davilow
had
seen
before
 
the
place
having
been
taken
for
her
by
her
brother
-
in
-
law
,
Mr.
Gascoigne
 
when
all
had
got
down
from
the
carriage
,
and
were
standing
under
the
porch
in
front
of
the
open
door
,
so
that
they
could
have
a
general
view
of
the
place
and
a
glimpse
of
the
stone
hall
and
staircase
hung
with
sombre
pictures
,
but
enlivened
by
a
bright
wood
fire
,
no
one
spoke
;
<EOS>
mamma
,
the
four
sisters
and
the
governess
all
looked
at
Gwendolen
,
as
if
their
feelings
depended
entirely
on
her
decision
.
<EOS>
Of
the
girls
,
from
Alice
in
her
sixteenth
year
to
Isabel
in
her
tenth
,
hardly
anything
could
be
said
on
a
first
view
,
but
that
they
were
girlish
,
and
that
their
black
dresses
were
getting
shabby
.
<EOS>
Miss
Merry
was
elderly
and
altogether
neutral
in
expression
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
's
worn
beauty
seemed
the
more
pathetic
for
the
look
of
entire
appeal
which
she
cast
at
Gwendolen
,
who
was
glancing
round
at
the
house
,
the
landscape
and
the
entrance
hall
with
an
air
of
rapid
judgment
.
<EOS>
Imagine
a
young
race
-
horse
in
the
paddock
among
untrimmed
ponies
and
patient
hacks
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
dear
,
what
do
you
think
of
the
place
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
at
last
,
in
a
gentle
,
deprecatory
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
is
charming
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
romantic
place
;
anything
delightful
may
happen
in
it
;
it
would
be
a
good
background
for
anything
.
<EOS>
No
one
need
be
ashamed
of
living
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
certainly
nothing
common
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
would
do
for
fallen
royalty
or
any
sort
of
grand
poverty
.
<EOS>
We
ought
properly
to
have
been
living
in
splendor
,
and
have
come
down
to
this
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
as
romantic
as
could
be
.
<EOS>
But
I
thought
my
uncle
and
aunt
Gascoigne
would
be
here
to
meet
us
,
and
my
cousin
Anna
,
"
added
Gwendolen
,
her
tone
changed
to
sharp
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
early
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
and
entering
the
hall
<EOS>
,
she
said
to
the
housekeeper
who
came
forward
,
"
You
expect
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gascoigne
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
madam
;
they
were
here
yesterday
to
give
particular
orders
about
the
fires
and
the
dinner
.
<EOS>
But
as
to
fires
,
I
've
had
'em
in
all
the
rooms
for
the
last
week
,
and
everything
is
well
aired
.
<EOS>
I
could
wish
some
of
the
furniture
paid
better
for
all
the
cleaning
it
's
had
,
but
I
_
think
_
<EOS>
you
'll
see
the
brasses
have
been
done
justice
to
.
<EOS>
I
_
think
_
<EOS>
when
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gascoigne
come
,
they
'll
tell
you
nothing
has
been
neglected
.
<EOS>
They
'll
be
here
at
five
,
for
certain
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
satisfied
Gwendolen
,
who
was
not
prepared
to
have
their
arrival
treated
with
indifference
;
and
after
tripping
a
little
way
up
the
matted
stone
staircase
to
take
a
survey
there
,
she
tripped
down
again
,
and
followed
by
all
the
girls
looked
into
each
of
the
rooms
opening
from
the
hall
 
<EOS>
the
dining
-
room
all
dark
oak
and
worn
red
satin
damask
,
with
a
copy
of
snarling
,
worrying
dogs
from
Snyders
over
the
side
-
board
,
and
a
Christ
breaking
bread
over
the
mantel
-
piece
;
the
library
with
a
general
aspect
and
smell
of
old
brown
-
leather
;
and
lastly
,
the
drawing
-
room
,
which
was
entered
through
a
small
antechamber
crowded
with
venerable
knick
-
knacks
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mamma
,
mamma
,
pray
come
here
!
"
<EOS>
said
Gwendolen
,
Mrs.
Davilow
having
followed
slowly
in
talk
with
the
housekeeper
.
<EOS>
"
Here
is
an
organ
.
<EOS>
I
will
be
Saint
Cecilia
:
some
one
shall
paint
me
as
Saint
Cecilia
.
<EOS>
Jocosa
<EOS>
(
this
was
her
name
for
Miss
Merry
)
,
let
down
my
hair
.
<EOS>
See
,
mamma
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
had
thrown
off
her
hat
and
gloves
,
and
seated
herself
before
the
organ
in
an
admirable
pose
,
looking
upward
;
while
the
submissive
and
sad
Jocosa
took
out
the
one
comb
which
fastened
the
coil
of
hair
,
and
then
shook
out
the
mass
till
it
fell
in
a
smooth
light
-
brown
stream
far
below
its
owner
's
slim
waist
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
smiled
and
said
,
"
A
charming
picture
,
my
dear
!
"
<EOS>
not
indifferent
to
the
display
of
her
pet
,
even
in
the
presence
of
a
housekeeper
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
rose
and
laughed
with
delight
.
<EOS>
All
this
seemed
quite
to
the
purpose
on
entering
a
new
house
which
was
so
excellent
a
background
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
queer
,
quaint
,
picturesque
room
!
<EOS>
"
she
went
on
,
looking
about
her
.
"
I
like
these
old
embroidered
chairs
,
and
the
garlands
on
the
wainscot
,
and
the
pictures
that
may
be
anything
.
<EOS>
That
one
with
the
ribs
 
nothing
but
ribs
and
darkness
 
<EOS>
I
should
think
that
is
Spanish
,
mamma
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Gwendolen
!
"
said
the
small
Isabel
,
in
a
tone
of
astonishment
,
while
she
held
open
a
hinged
panel
of
the
wainscot
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
Every
one
,
Gwendolen
first
,
went
to
look
.
<EOS>
The
opened
panel
had
disclosed
the
picture
of
an
upturned
dead
face
,
from
which
an
obscure
figure
seemed
to
be
fleeing
with
outstretched
arms
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
horrible
!
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
with
a
look
of
mere
disgust
;
but
Gwendolen
shuddered
silently
,
and
Isabel
,
a
plain
and
altogether
inconvenient
child
with
an
alarming
memory
,
said
    
"
You
will
never
stay
in
this
room
by
yourself
,
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
dare
you
open
things
which
were
meant
to
be
shut
up
,
you
perverse
little
creature
?
"
said
Gwendolen
,
in
her
angriest
tone
.
<EOS>
Then
snatching
the
panel
out
of
the
hand
of
the
culprit
,
she
closed
it
hastily
,
saying
,
"
There
is
a
lock
 
where
is
the
key
?
<EOS>
Let
the
key
be
found
,
or
else
let
one
be
made
,
and
let
nobody
open
it
again
;
or
rather
,
let
the
key
be
brought
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
this
command
to
everybody
in
general
Gwendolen
turned
with
a
face
which
was
flushed
in
reaction
from
her
chill
shudder
,
and
said
,
"
Let
us
go
up
to
our
own
room
,
mamma
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
housekeeper
on
searching
found
the
key
in
the
drawer
of
the
cabinet
close
by
the
panel
,
and
presently
handed
it
to
Bugle
,
the
lady's
-
maid
,
telling
her
significantly
to
give
it
to
her
Royal
Highness
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
,
Mrs.
Startin
,
"
said
Bugle
,
who
had
been
busy
up
-
stairs
during
the
scene
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
was
rather
offended
at
this
irony
in
a
new
servant
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
the
young
lady
that
's
to
command
us
all
-
and
well
worthy
for
looks
and
figure
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Startin
in
propitiation
.
<EOS>
"
She
'll
know
what
key
it
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
have
laid
out
what
we
want
,
go
and
see
to
the
others
,
Bugle
,
<EOS>
"
Gwendolen
had
said
,
when
she
and
Mrs.
Davilow
entered
their
black
and
yellow
bedroom
,
where
a
pretty
little
white
couch
was
prepared
by
the
side
of
the
black
and
yellow
catafalque
known
as
the
best
bed
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
help
mamma
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
her
first
movement
was
to
go
to
the
tall
mirror
between
the
windows
,
which
reflected
herself
and
the
room
completely
,
while
her
mamma
sat
down
and
also
looked
at
the
reflection
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
a
becoming
glass
,
Gwendolen
;
or
is
it
the
black
and
gold
color
that
sets
you
off
?
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
as
Gwendolen
stood
obliquely
with
her
three
-
quarter
face
turned
toward
the
mirror
,
and
her
left
hand
brushing
back
the
stream
of
hair
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
make
a
tolerable
St.
Cecilia
with
some
white
roses
on
my
head
,
"
said
Gwendolen

"
only
how
about
my
nose
,
mamma
?
<EOS>
I
think
saint
's
noses
never
in
the
least
turn
up
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
had
given
me
your
perfectly
straight
nose
;
it
would
have
done
for
any
sort
of
character
 
a
nose
of
all
work
.
<EOS>
Mine
is
only
a
happy
nose
;
it
would
not
do
so
well
for
tragedy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
dear
,
any
nose
will
do
to
be
miserable
with
in
this
world
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
with
a
deep
,
weary
sigh
,
throwing
her
black
bonnet
on
the
table
,
and
resting
her
elbow
near
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
mamma
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
in
a
strongly
remonstrant
tone
,
turning
away
from
the
glass
with
an
air
of
vexation
,
"
do
n't
begin
to
be
dull
here
.
<EOS>
It
spoils
all
my
pleasure
,
and
everything
may
be
so
happy
now
.
<EOS>
What
have
you
to
be
gloomy
about
_
now
_
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Nothing
,
dear
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
seeming
to
rouse
herself
,
and
beginning
to
take
off
her
dress
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
always
enough
for
me
to
see
you
happy
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
should
be
happy
yourself
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
still
discontentedly
,
though
going
to
help
her
mamma
with
caressing
touches
.
<EOS>
"
Can
nobody
be
happy
after
they
are
quite
young
?
<EOS>
You
have
made
me
feel
sometimes
as
if
nothing
were
of
any
use
.
<EOS>
With
the
girls
<EOS>
so
troublesome
,
and
Jocosa
so
dreadfully
wooden
and
ugly
,
and
everything
make
-
shift
about
us
,
and
you
looking
so
dull
 
<EOS>
what
was
the
use
of
my
being
anything
?
<EOS>
But
now
you
_
might
_
be
happy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
shall
,
dear
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
patting
the
cheek
that
was
bending
near
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
but
really
.
<EOS>
Not
with
a
sort
of
make
-
believe
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
with
resolute
perseverance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
See
what
a
hand
and
arm
!
 
<EOS>
much
more
beautiful
than
mine
.
<EOS>
Any
one
can
see
you
were
altogether
more
beautiful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
dear
;
I
was
always
heavier
.
<EOS>
Never
half
so
charming
as
you
are
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
what
is
the
use
of
my
being
charming
,
if
it
is
to
end
in
my
being
dull
and
not
minding
anything
?
<EOS>
Is
that
what
marriage
always
comes
to
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
child
,
certainly
not
.
<EOS>
Marriage
is
the
only
happy
state
for
a
woman
,
as
I
trust
you
will
prove
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
put
up
with
it
if
it
is
not
a
happy
state
.
<EOS>
I
am
determined
to
be
happy
 
at
least
not
to
go
on
muddling
away
my
life
as
other
people
do
,
being
and
doing
nothing
remarkable
.
<EOS>
I
have
made
up
my
mind
not
to
let
other
people
interfere
with
me
as
they
have
done
.
<EOS>
Here
is
some
warm
water
ready
for
you
,
mamma
,
"
Gwendolen
ended
,
proceeding
to
take
off
her
own
dress
and
then
waiting
to
have
her
hair
wound
up
by
her
mamma
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
silence
for
a
minute
or
two
,
till
Mrs.
Davilow
said
,
while
coiling
the
daughter
's
hair
,
"
I
am
sure
I
have
never
crossed
you
,
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
often
want
me
to
do
what
I
do
n't
like
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
,
to
give
Alice
lessons
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
And
I
have
done
it
because
you
asked
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
see
why
I
should
,
else
.
<EOS>
It
bores
me
to
death
,
she
is
so
slow
.
<EOS>
She
has
no
ear
for
music
,
or
language
,
or
anything
else
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
much
better
for
her
to
be
ignorant
<EOS>
,
mamma
<EOS>
:
it
is
her
<EOS>
_
rôle
_
<EOS>
,
she
would
do
it
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
a
hard
thing
to
say
of
your
poor
sister
,
Gwendolen
,
who
is
so
good
to
you
,
and
waits
on
you
hand
and
foot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
why
it
is
hard
to
call
things
by
their
right
names
,
and
put
them
in
their
proper
places
.
<EOS>
The
hardship
is
for
me
to
have
to
waste
my
time
on
her
.
<EOS>
Now
let
me
fasten
up
your
hair
,
mamma
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
make
haste
;
your
uncle
and
aunt
will
be
here
soon
.
<EOS>
For
heaven
's
sake
,
do
n't
be
scornful
to
_
them
<EOS>
_
,
my
dear
child
!
<EOS>
or
to
your
cousin
Anna
,
whom
you
will
always
be
going
out
with
.
<EOS>
Do
promise
me
,
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
you
ca
n't
expect
Anna
to
be
equal
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
her
to
be
equal
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
with
a
toss
of
her
head
and
a
smile
,
and
the
discussion
ended
there
.
  
<EOS>
When
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gascoigne
and
their
daughter
came
,
Gwendolen
,
far
from
being
scornful
,
behaved
as
prettily
as
possible
to
them
.
<EOS>
She
was
introducing
herself
anew
to
relatives
who
had
not
seen
her
since
the
comparatively
unfinished
age
of
sixteen
,
and
she
was
anxious
 
<EOS>
no
,
not
anxious
,
but
resolved
that
they
should
admire
her
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Gascoigne
bore
a
family
likeness
to
her
sister
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
darker
and
slighter
,
her
face
was
unworn
by
grief
,
her
movements
were
less
languid
,
her
expression
more
alert
and
critical
as
that
of
a
rector
's
wife
bound
to
exert
a
beneficent
authority
.
<EOS>
Their
closest
resemblance
lay
in
a
non
-
resistant
disposition
,
inclined
to
imitation
and
obedience
;
but
this
,
owing
to
the
difference
in
their
circumstances
,
had
led
them
to
very
different
issues
.
<EOS>
The
younger
sister
had
been
indiscreet
,
or
at
least
unfortunate
in
her
marriages
;
the
elder
believed
herself
the
most
enviable
of
wives
,
and
her
pliancy
had
ended
in
her
sometimes
taking
shapes
of
surprising
definiteness
.
<EOS>
Many
of
her
opinions
,
such
as
those
on
church
government
and
the
character
of
Archbishop
Laud
,
seemed
too
decided
under
every
alteration
to
have
been
arrived
at
otherwise
than
by
a
wifely
receptiveness
.
<EOS>
And
there
was
much
to
encourage
trust
in
her
husband
's
authority
.
<EOS>
He
had
some
agreeable
virtues
,
some
striking
advantages
,
and
the
failings
that
were
imputed
to
him
all
leaned
toward
the
side
of
success
.
  
<EOS>
One
of
his
advantages
was
a
fine
person
,
which
perhaps
was
even
more
impressive
at
fifty
-
seven
than
it
had
been
earlier
in
life
.
<EOS>
There
were
no
distinctively
clerical
lines
in
the
face
,
no
tricks
of
starchiness
or
of
affected
ease
:
in
his
Inverness
cape
he
could
not
have
been
identified
except
as
a
gentleman
with
handsome
dark
features
,
a
nose
which
began
with
an
intention
to
be
aquiline
but
suddenly
became
straight
,
and
iron
-
gray
,
hair
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
owed
this
freedom
from
the
sort
of
professional
make
-
up
which
penetrates
skin
,
tones
and
gestures
and
defies
all
drapery
,
to
the
fact
that
he
had
once
been
Captain
Gaskin
,
having
taken
orders
and
a
diphthong
but
shortly
before
his
engagement
to
Miss
Armyn
.
<EOS>
If
any
one
had
objected
that
his
preparation
for
the
clerical
function
was
inadequate
,
his
friends
might
have
asked
who
made
a
better
figure
in
it
,
who
preached
better
or
had
more
authority
in
his
parish
?
<EOS>
He
had
a
native
gift
for
administration
,
being
tolerant
both
of
opinions
and
conduct
,
because
he
felt
himself
able
to
overrule
them
,
and
was
free
from
the
irritations
of
conscious
feebleness
.
<EOS>
He
smiled
pleasantly
at
the
foible
of
a
taste
which
he
did
not
share
 
at
floriculture
or
antiquarianism
for
example
,
which
were
much
in
vogue
among
his
fellow
-
clergyman
in
the
diocese
:
for
himself
,
he
preferred
following
the
history
of
a
campaign
,
or
divining
from
his
knowledge
of
Nesselrode
's
motives
what
would
have
been
his
conduct
if
our
cabinet
had
taken
a
different
course
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
's
tone
of
thinking
after
some
long
-
quieted
fluctuations
had
become
ecclesiastical
rather
than
theological
;
not
the
modern
Anglican
,
but
what
he
would
have
called
sound
English
,
free
from
nonsense
;
such
as
became
a
man
who
looked
at
a
national
religion
by
daylight
,
and
saw
it
in
its
relation
to
other
things
.
<EOS>
No
clerical
magistrate
had
greater
weight
at
sessions
,
or
less
of
mischievous
impracticableness
in
relation
to
worldly
affairs
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
worst
imputation
thrown
out
against
him
<EOS>
was
worldliness
<EOS>
:
it
could
not
be
proved
that
he
forsook
the
less
fortunate
,
but
it
was
not
to
be
denied
that
the
friendships
he
cultivated
were
of
a
kind
likely
to
be
useful
to
the
father
of
six
sons
and
two
daughters
;
and
bitter
observers
 
for
in
Wessex
,
say
<EOS>
ten
years
ago
,
there
were
persons
whose
bitterness
may
now
seem
incredible
 
remarked
that
the
color
of
his
opinions
had
changed
in
consistency
with
this
principle
of
action
.
<EOS>
But
cheerful
,
successful
worldliness
has
a
false
air
of
being
more
selfish
than
the
acrid
,
unsuccessful
kind
,
whose
secret
history
is
summed
up
in
the
terrible
words
,
"
Sold
,
but
not
paid
for
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
wondered
that
she
had
not
better
remembered
how
very
fine
a
man
her
uncle
was
;
but
at
the
age
of
sixteen
she
was
a
less
capable
and
more
indifferent
judge
.
<EOS>
At
present
it
was
a
matter
of
extreme
interest
to
her
that
she
was
to
have
the
near
countenance
of
a
dignified
male
relative
,
and
that
the
family
life
would
cease
to
be
entirely
,
insipidly
feminine
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
intend
that
her
uncle
should
control
her
,
but
she
saw
at
once
that
it
would
be
altogether
agreeable
to
her
that
he
should
be
proud
of
introducing
her
as
his
niece
.
<EOS>
And
there
was
every
sign
of
his
being
likely
to
feel
that
pride
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
looked
at
her
with
admiration
as
he
said
    
"
You
have
outgrown
Anna
,
my
dear
,
"
putting
his
arm
tenderly
round
his
daughter
,
whose
shy
face
was
a
tiny
copy
of
his
own
,
and
drawing
her
forward
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
is
not
so
old
as
you
by
a
year
,
but
her
growing
days
are
certainly
over
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
be
excellent
companions
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
did
give
a
comparing
glance
at
his
daughter
,
but
if
he
saw
her
inferiority
,
he
might
also
see
that
Anna
's
timid
appearance
and
miniature
figure
must
appeal
to
a
different
taste
from
that
which
was
attracted
by
Gwendolen
,
and
that
the
girls
could
hardly
be
rivals
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
at
least
,
was
aware
of
this
,
and
kissed
her
cousin
with
real
cordiality
as
well
as
grace
,
saying
,
"
A
companion
is
just
what
I
want
.
<EOS>
I
am
so
glad
we
are
come
to
live
here
.
<EOS>
And
mamma
will
be
much
happier
<EOS>
now
she
is
near
you
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
aunt
trusted
indeed
that
it
would
be
so
,
and
felt
it
a
blessing
that
a
suitable
home
had
been
vacant
in
their
uncle
's
parish
.
<EOS>
Then
,
of
course
,
notice
had
to
be
taken
of
the
four
other
girls
,
whom
Gwendolen
had
always
felt
to
be
superfluous
:
all
of
a
girlish
average
that
made
four
units
utterly
unimportant
,
and
yet
from
her
earliest
days
an
obtrusive
influential
fact
in
her
life
.
<EOS>
She
was
conscious
of
having
been
much
kinder
to
them
than
could
have
been
expected
.
<EOS>
And
it
was
evident
to
her
that
her
uncle
and
aunt
also
felt
it
a
pity
there
were
so
many
girls
:
 
what
rational
person
could
feel
otherwise
,
except
poor
mamma
,
who
never
would
see
how
Alice
set
up
her
shoulders
and
lifted
her
eyebrows
till
she
had
no
forehead
left
,
how
Bertha
and
Fanny
whispered
and
tittered
together
about
everything
,
or
how
Isabel
was
always
listening
and
staring
and
forgetting
where
she
was
,
and
treading
on
the
toes
of
her
suffering
elders
?
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
brothers
,
Anna
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
while
the
sisters
were
being
noticed
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
are
enviable
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Anna
,
simply
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
fond
of
them
;
but
of
course
their
education
is
a
great
anxiety
to
papa
.
<EOS>
He
used
to
say
they
made
me
a
tomboy
.
<EOS>
I
really
was
a
great
romp
with
Rex
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
will
like
Rex
.
<EOS>
He
will
come
home
before
Christmas
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
I
used
to
think
you
rather
wild
and
shy
;
but
it
is
difficult
now
to
imagine
you
a
romp
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
smiling
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
I
am
altered
now
;
I
am
come
out
,
and
all
that
.
<EOS>
But
in
reality
I
like
to
go
blackberrying
with
Edwy
and
Lotta
as
well
as
ever
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
very
fond
of
going
out
;
but
I
dare
say
I
shall
like
it
better
<EOS>
now
you
will
be
often
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
at
all
clever
,
and
I
never
know
what
to
say
.
<EOS>
It
seems
so
useless
to
say
what
everybody
knows
,
and
I
can
think
of
nothing
else
,
except
what
papa
says
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
shall
like
going
out
with
you
very
much
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
well
disposed
toward
this
_
naïve
_
cousin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Are
you
fond
of
riding
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
but
we
have
only
one
Shetland
pony
amongst
us
.
<EOS>
Papa
says
he
ca
n't
afford
more
,
besides
the
carriage
-
horses
and
his
own
nag
;
he
has
so
many
expenses
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
intend
to
have
a
horse
and
ride
a
great
deal
now
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
in
a
tone
of
decision
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Is
the
society
pleasant
in
this
neighborhood
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
says
it
is
,
very
.
<EOS>
There
are
the
clergymen
all
about
,
you
know
;
and
the
Quallons
,
and
the
Arrowpoints
,
and
Lord
Brackenshaw
,
and
Sir
Hugo
Mallinger
's
place
,
where
there
is
nobody
 
<EOS>
that
's
very
nice
,
because
we
make
picnics
there
 
and
two
or
three
families
at
Wanchester
:
<EOS>
oh
,
and
old
Mrs.
Vulcany
,
at
Nuttingwood
,
and
 
"
  
<EOS>
But
Anna
was
relieved
of
this
tax
on
her
descriptive
powers
by
the
announcement
of
dinner
,
and
Gwendolen
's
question
was
soon
indirectly
answered
by
her
uncle
,
who
dwelt
much
on
the
advantages
he
had
secured
for
them
in
getting
a
place
like
Offendene
.
<EOS>
Except
the
rent
,
it
involved
no
more
expense
than
an
ordinary
house
at
Wanchester
would
have
done
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
it
is
always
worth
while
to
make
a
little
sacrifice
for
a
good
style
of
house
,
"
said
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
in
his
easy
,
pleasantly
confident
tone
,
which
made
the
world
in
general
seem
a
very
manageable
place
of
residence
:
"
<EOS>
especially
where
there
is
only
a
lady
at
the
head
.
<EOS>
All
the
best
people
will
call
upon
you
;
and
you
need
give
no
expensive
dinners
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
I
have
to
spend
a
good
deal
in
that
way
;
it
is
a
large
item
.
<EOS>
But
then
I
get
my
house
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
to
pay
three
hundred
a
year
for
my
house
I
could
not
keep
a
table
.
<EOS>
My
boys
are
too
great
a
drain
on
me
.
<EOS>
You
are
better
off
than
we
are
,
in
proportion
;
there
is
no
great
drain
on
you
now
,
after
your
house
and
carriage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
,
Fanny
,
now
that
the
children
are
growing
up
,
I
am
obliged
to
cut
and
contrive
,
"
said
Mrs.
Gascoigne
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
a
good
manager
by
nature
,
but
Henry
has
taught
me
.
<EOS>
He
is
wonderful
for
making
the
best
of
everything
;
he
allows
himself
no
extras
,
and
gets
his
curates
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
It
is
rather
hard
that
he
has
not
been
made
a
prebendary
or
something
,
as
others
have
been
,
considering
the
friends
he
has
made
and
the
need
there
is
for
men
of
moderate
opinions
in
all
respects
.
<EOS>
If
the
Church
is
to
keep
its
position
,
ability
and
character
ought
to
tell
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
dear
Nancy
,
you
forget
the
old
story
 
thank
Heaven
,
there
are
three
hundred
as
good
as
I.
<EOS>
And
ultimately
,
we
shall
have
no
reason
to
complain
<EOS>
,
I
am
pretty
sure
.
<EOS>
There
could
hardly
be
a
more
thorough
friend
than
Lord
Brackenshaw
 
<EOS>
your
landlord
,
you
know
,
Fanny
.
<EOS>
Lady
Brackenshaw
will
call
upon
you
.
<EOS>
And
I
have
spoken
for
Gwendolen
to
be
a
member
of
our
Archery
Club
 
<EOS>
the
Brackenshaw
Archery
Club
 
the
most
select
thing
anywhere
.
<EOS>
That
is
,
if
she
has
no
objection
,
"
added
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
looking
at
Gwendolen
with
pleasant
irony
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
it
of
all
things
,
"
said
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
I
enjoy
more
than
taking
aim
 
and
hitting
,
"
she
ended
,
with
a
pretty
nod
and
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
Our
Anna
,
poor
child
,
is
too
short
-
sighed
for
archery
.
<EOS>
But
I
consider
myself
a
first
-
rate
shot
,
and
you
shall
practice
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
must
make
you
an
accomplished
archer
before
our
great
meeting
in
July
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
as
to
neighborhood
,
you
could
hardly
be
better
placed
.
<EOS>
There
are
the
Arrowpoints
 
<EOS>
they
are
some
of
our
best
people
.
<EOS>
Miss
Arrowpoint
is
a
delightful
girl
 
<EOS>
she
has
been
presented
at
Court
.
<EOS>
They
have
a
magnificent
place
 
Quetcham
Hall
 
worth
seeing
in
point
of
art
;
and
their
parties
,
to
which
you
are
sure
to
be
invited
,
are
the
best
things
of
the
sort
we
have
.
<EOS>
The
archdeacon
is
intimate
there
,
and
they
have
always
a
good
kind
of
people
staying
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
is
peculiar
,
certainly
;
something
of
a
caricature
,
in
fact
;
but
well
-
meaning
.
<EOS>
And
Miss
Arrowpoint
is
as
nice
as
possible
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
all
young
ladies
who
have
mothers
as
handsome
and
graceful
as
yours
and
Anna
's
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
smiled
faintly
at
this
little
compliment
,
but
the
husband
and
wife
looked
affectionately
at
each
other
,
and
Gwendolen
thought
,
"
My
uncle
and
aunt
,
at
least
,
are
happy
:
they
are
not
dull
and
dismal
.
"
<EOS>
Altogether
,
she
felt
satisfied
with
her
prospects
at
Offendene
,
as
a
great
improvement
on
anything
she
had
known
.
<EOS>
Even
the
cheap
curates
,
she
incidentally
learned
,
were
almost
always
young
men
of
family
,
and
Mr.
Middleton
,
the
actual
curate
,
was
said
to
be
quite
an
acquisition
:
it
was
only
a
pity
<EOS>
he
was
so
soon
to
leave
.
  
<EOS>
But
there
was
one
point
which
she
was
so
anxious
to
gain
that
she
could
not
allow
the
evening
to
pass
without
taking
her
measures
toward
securing
it
.
<EOS>
Her
mamma
,
she
knew
,
intended
to
submit
entirely
to
her
uncle
's
judgment
with
regard
to
expenditure
;
and
the
submission
was
not
merely
prudential
,
for
Mrs.
Davilow
,
conscious
that
she
had
always
been
seen
under
a
cloud
as
poor
dear
Fanny
,
who
had
made
a
sad
blunder
with
her
second
marriage
,
felt
a
hearty
satisfaction
in
being
frankly
and
cordially
identified
with
her
sister
's
family
,
and
in
having
her
affairs
canvassed
and
managed
with
an
authority
which
presupposed
a
genuine
interest
.
<EOS>
Thus
the
question
of
a
suitable
saddle
-
horse
,
which
had
been
sufficiently
discussed
with
mamma
,
had
to
be
referred
to
Mr.
Gascoigne
;
and
after
Gwendolen
had
played
on
the
piano
,
which
had
been
provided
from
Wanchester
,
had
sung
to
her
hearers
'
admiration
,
and
had
induced
her
uncle
to
join
her
in
a
duet
 
what
more
softening
influence
than
this
on
any
uncle
who
would
have
sung
finely
if
his
time
had
not
been
too
much
taken
up
by
graver
matters
?
 
<EOS>
she
seized
the
opportune
moment
for
saying
,
"
Mamma
,
you
have
not
spoken
to
my
uncle
about
my
riding
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Gwendolen
desires
above
all
things
to
have
a
horse
to
ride
 
a
pretty
,
light
,
lady
's
horse
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
looking
at
Mr.
Gascoigne
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
we
can
manage
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
projected
his
lower
lip
and
lifted
his
handsome
eyebrows
sarcastically
at
Gwendolen
,
who
had
seated
herself
with
much
grace
on
the
elbow
of
her
mamma
's
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
could
lend
her
the
pony
sometimes
,
"
said
Mrs.
Gascoigne
,
watching
her
husband
's
face
,
and
feeling
quite
ready
to
disapprove
if
he
did
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
might
be
inconveniencing
others
,
aunt
,
and
would
be
no
pleasure
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
endure
ponies
,
"
said
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
give
up
some
other
indulgence
and
have
a
horse
.
"
<EOS>
(
Was
there
ever
a
young
lady
or
gentleman
not
ready
to
give
up
an
unspecified
indulgence
for
the
sake
of
the
favorite
one
specified
?
)
  
<EOS>
"
She
rides
so
well
.
<EOS>
She
has
had
lessons
,
and
the
riding
-
master
said
she
had
so
good
a
seat
and
hand
<EOS>
she
might
be
trusted
with
any
mount
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
who
,
even
if
she
had
not
wished
her
darling
to
have
the
horse
,
would
not
have
dared
to
be
lukewarm
in
trying
to
get
it
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
the
price
of
the
horse
 
a
good
sixty
with
the
best
chance
,
and
then
his
keep
,
"
said
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
in
a
tone
which
,
though
demurring
,
betrayed
the
inward
presence
of
something
that
favored
the
demand
.
<EOS>
"
There
are
the
carriage
-
horses
 
already
a
heavy
item
.
<EOS>
And
remember
what
you
ladies
cost
in
toilet
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
really
wear
nothing
but
two
black
dresses
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
hastily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
the
younger
girls
,
of
course
,
require
no
toilet
at
present
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
Gwendolen
will
save
me
so
much
by
giving
her
sisters
lessons
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
Mrs.
Davilow
's
delicate
cheek
showed
a
rapid
blush
.
<EOS>
"
If
it
were
not
for
that
,
I
must
really
have
a
more
expensive
governess
,
and
masters
besides
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
felt
some
anger
with
her
mamma
,
but
carefully
concealed
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
good
 
<EOS>
that
is
decidedly
good
,
"
said
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
heartily
,
looking
at
his
wife
.
<EOS>
And
Gwendolen
,
who
,
it
must
be
owned
,
was
a
deep
young
lady
,
suddenly
moved
away
to
the
other
end
of
the
long
drawing
-
room
,
and
busied
herself
with
arranging
pieces
of
music
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
dear
child
has
had
no
indulgences
,
no
pleasures
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
in
a
pleading
undertone
.
<EOS>
"
I
feel
the
expense
is
rather
imprudent
in
this
first
year
of
our
settling
.
<EOS>
But
she
really
needs
the
exercise
 
she
needs
cheering
.
<EOS>
And
if
you
were
to
see
her
on
horseback
,
it
is
something
splendid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
what
we
could
not
afford
for
Anna
,
"
said
Mrs.
Gascoigne
.
<EOS>
"
But
she
,
dear
child
,
would
ride
Lotta
's
donkey
and
think
it
good
enough
.
"
<EOS>
(
Anna
was
absorbed
in
a
game
with
Isabel
,
who
had
hunted
out
an
old
back
-
gammon
-
board
,
and
had
begged
to
sit
up
an
extra
hour
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
a
fine
woman
never
looks
better
than
on
horseback
,
"
said
Mr.
Gascoigne
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
Gwendolen
has
the
figure
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
say
the
thing
should
not
be
considered
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
might
try
it
for
a
time
,
at
all
events
.
<EOS>
It
can
be
given
up
,
if
necessary
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
will
consult
Lord
Brackenshaw
's
head
groom
.
<EOS>
He
is
my
_
fidus
Achates
_
in
the
horsey
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thanks
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
much
relieved
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
kind
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
he
always
is
,
"
said
Mrs.
Gascoigne
.
<EOS>
And
later
that
night
,
when
she
and
her
husband
were
in
private
,
she
said
    
"
I
thought
you
were
almost
too
indulgent
about
the
horse
for
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
She
ought
not
to
claim
so
much
more
than
your
own
daughter
would
think
of
.
<EOS>
Especially
before
we
see
how
Fanny
manages
on
her
income
.
<EOS>
And
you
really
have
enough
to
do
without
taking
all
this
trouble
on
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Nancy
,
one
must
look
at
things
from
every
point
of
view
.
<EOS>
This
girl
is
really
worth
some
expense
:
you
do
n't
often
see
her
equal
.
<EOS>
She
ought
to
make
a
first
-
rate
marriage
,
and
I
should
not
be
doing
my
duty
if
I
spared
my
trouble
in
helping
her
forward
.
<EOS>
You
know
yourself
she
has
been
under
a
disadvantage
with
such
a
father
-
in
-
law
,
and
a
second
family
,
keeping
her
always
in
the
shade
.
<EOS>
I
feel
for
the
girl
,
And
I
should
like
your
sister
and
her
family
now
to
have
the
benefit
of
your
having
married
rather
a
better
specimen
of
our
kind
than
she
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Rather
better
!
<EOS>
I
should
think
so
.
<EOS>
However
,
it
is
for
me
to
be
grateful
that
you
will
take
so
much
on
your
shoulders
for
the
sake
of
my
sister
and
her
children
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
would
not
grudge
anything
to
poor
Fanny
.
<EOS>
But
there
is
one
thing
I
have
been
thinking
of
,
though
you
have
never
mentioned
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
that
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
The
boys
.
<EOS>
I
hope
they
will
not
be
falling
in
love
with
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
presuppose
anything
of
the
kind
,
my
dear
,
and
there
will
be
no
danger
.
<EOS>
Rex
will
never
be
at
home
for
long
together
,
and
Warham
is
going
to
India
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
wiser
plan
to
take
it
for
granted
that
cousins
will
not
fall
in
love
.
<EOS>
If
you
begin
with
precautions
,
the
affair
will
come
in
spite
of
them
.
<EOS>
One
must
not
undertake
to
act
for
Providence
in
these
matters
,
which
can
no
more
be
held
under
the
hand
than
a
brood
of
chickens
.
<EOS>
The
boys
will
have
nothing
,
and
Gwendolen
will
have
nothing
.
<EOS>
They
ca
n't
marry
.
<EOS>
At
the
worst
there
would
only
be
a
little
crying
,
and
you
ca
n't
save
boys
and
girls
from
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Gascoigne
's
mind
was
satisfied
:
if
anything
did
happen
,
there
was
the
comfort
of
feeling
that
her
husband
would
know
what
was
to
be
done
,
and
would
have
the
energy
to
do
it
.

It
would
be
a
little
hard
to
blame
the
rector
of
Pennicote
that
in
the
course
of
looking
at
things
from
every
point
of
view
,
he
looked
at
Gwendolen
as
a
girl
likely
to
make
a
brilliant
marriage
.
<EOS>
Why
should
he
be
expected
to
differ
from
his
contemporaries
in
this
matter
,
and
wish
his
niece
a
worse
end
of
her
charming
maidenhood
than
they
would
approve
as
the
best
possible
?
<EOS>
It
is
rather
to
be
set
down
to
his
credit
that
his
feelings
on
the
subject
were
entirely
good
-
natured
.
<EOS>
And
in
considering
the
relation
of
means
to
ends
,
it
would
have
been
mere
folly
to
have
been
guided
by
the
exceptional
and
idyllic
 
to
have
recommended
that
Gwendolen
should
wear
a
gown
as
shabby
as
Griselda
's
in
order
that
a
marquis
might
fall
in
love
with
her
,
or
to
have
insisted
that
since
a
fair
maiden
was
to
be
sought
,
she
should
keep
herself
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
's
calculations
were
of
the
kind
called
rational
,
and
he
did
not
even
think
of
getting
a
too
frisky
horse
in
order
that
Gwendolen
might
be
threatened
with
an
accident
and
be
rescued
by
a
man
of
property
.
<EOS>
He
wished
his
niece
well
,
and
he
meant
her
to
be
seen
to
advantage
in
the
best
society
of
the
neighborhood
.
  
<EOS>
Her
uncle
's
intention
fell
in
perfectly
with
Gwendolen
's
own
wishes
.
<EOS>
But
let
no
one
suppose
that
she
also
contemplated
a
brilliant
marriage
as
the
direct
end
of
her
witching
the
world
with
her
grace
on
horseback
,
or
with
any
other
accomplishment
.
<EOS>
That
she
was
to
be
married
<EOS>
some
time
or
other
she
would
have
felt
obliged
to
admit
;
and
that
her
marriage
would
not
be
of
a
middling
kind
,
such
as
most
girls
were
contented
with
<EOS>
,
she
felt
quietly
,
unargumentatively
sure
.
<EOS>
But
her
thoughts
never
dwelt
on
marriage
as
the
fulfillment
of
her
ambition
;
the
dramas
in
which
she
imagined
herself
a
heroine
were
not
wrought
up
to
that
close
.
<EOS>
To
be
very
much
sued
or
hopelessly
sighed
for
as
a
bride
was
indeed
an
indispensable
and
agreeable
guarantee
of
womanly
power
;
but
to
become
a
wife
and
wear
all
the
domestic
fetters
of
that
condition
,
was
on
the
whole
a
vexatious
necessity
.
<EOS>
Her
observation
of
matrimony
had
inclined
her
to
think
it
rather
a
dreary
state
in
which
a
woman
could
not
do
what
she
liked
,
had
more
children
than
were
desirable
,
was
consequently
dull
,
and
became
irrevocably
immersed
in
humdrum
.
<EOS>
Of
course
marriage
was
social
promotion
;
she
could
not
look
forward
to
a
single
life
;
but
promotions
have
sometimes
to
be
taken
with
bitter
herbs
 
a
peerage
will
not
quite
do
instead
of
leadership
to
the
man
who
meant
to
lead
;
and
this
delicate
-
limbed
sylph
of
twenty
meant
to
lead
.
<EOS>
For
such
passions
dwell
in
feminine
breasts
also
.
<EOS>
In
Gwendolen
's
,
however
,
they
dwelt
among
strictly
feminine
furniture
,
and
had
no
disturbing
reference
to
the
advancement
of
learning
or
the
balance
of
the
constitution
;
her
knowledge
being
such
as
with
no
sort
of
standing
-
room
or
length
of
lever
could
have
been
expected
to
move
the
world
.
<EOS>
She
meant
to
do
what
was
pleasant
to
herself
in
a
striking
manner
;
or
rather
,
whatever
she
could
do
so
as
to
strike
others
with
admiration
and
get
in
that
reflected
way
a
more
ardent
sense
of
living
,
seemed
pleasant
to
her
fancy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gwendolen
will
not
rest
without
having
the
world
at
her
feet
,
"
said
Miss
Merry
,
the
meek
governess
:
hyperbolical
words
which
have
long
come
to
carry
the
most
moderate
meanings
;
for
who
has
not
heard
of
private
persons
having
the
world
at
their
feet
in
the
shape
of
some
half
-
dozen
items
of
flattering
regard
generally
known
in
a
genteel
suburb
?
<EOS>
And
words
could
hardly
be
too
wide
or
vague
to
indicate
the
prospect
that
made
a
hazy
largeness
about
poor
Gwendolen
on
the
heights
of
her
young
self
-
exultation
.
<EOS>
Other
people
allowed
themselves
to
be
made
slaves
of
,
and
to
have
their
lives
blown
hither
and
thither
like
empty
ships
in
which
no
will
was
present
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
to
be
so
with
her
;
she
would
no
longer
be
sacrificed
to
creatures
worth
less
than
herself
,
but
would
make
the
very
best
of
the
chances
that
life
offered
her
,
and
conquer
circumstances
by
her
exceptional
cleverness
.
<EOS>
Certainly
,
to
be
settled
at
Offendene
,
with
the
notice
of
Lady
Brackenshaw
,
the
archery
club
,
and
invitations
to
dine
with
the
Arrowpoints
,
as
the
highest
lights
in
her
scenery
,
was
not
a
position
that
seemed
to
offer
remarkable
chances
;
but
Gwendolen
's
confidence
lay
chiefly
in
herself
.
<EOS>
She
felt
well
equipped
for
the
mastery
of
life
.
<EOS>
With
regard
to
much
in
her
lot
hitherto
,
she
held
herself
rather
hardly
dealt
with
,
but
as
to
her
"
education
,
"
she
would
have
admitted
that
it
had
left
her
under
no
disadvantages
.
<EOS>
In
the
school
-
room
her
quick
mind
had
taken
readily
that
strong
starch
of
unexplained
rules
and
disconnected
facts
which
saves
ignorance
from
any
painful
sense
of
limpness
;
and
what
remained
of
all
things
knowable
,
she
was
conscious
of
being
sufficiently
acquainted
with
through
novels
,
plays
and
poems
.
<EOS>
About
her
French
and
music
,
the
two
justifying
accomplishments
of
a
young
lady
,
she
felt
no
ground
for
uneasiness
;
and
when
to
all
these
qualifications
,
negative
and
positive
,
we
add
the
spontaneous
sense
of
capability
some
happy
persons
are
born
with
,
so
that
any
subject
they
turn
their
attention
to
impresses
them
with
their
own
power
of
forming
a
correct
judgment
on
it
,
who
can
wonder
if
Gwendolen
felt
ready
to
manage
her
own
destiny
?
  
<EOS>
There
were
many
subjects
in
the
world
 
<EOS>
perhaps
the
majority
 
in
which
she
felt
no
interest
,
because
they
were
stupid
;
for
subjects
are
apt
to
appear
stupid
to
the
young
as
light
seems
dull
to
the
old
;
but
she
would
not
have
felt
at
all
helpless
in
relation
to
them
if
they
had
turned
up
in
conversation
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
remembered
that
no
one
had
disputed
her
power
or
her
general
superiority
.
<EOS>
As
on
the
arrival
at
Offendene
,
so
always
,
the
first
thought
of
those
about
her
had
been
,
what
will
Gwendolen
think
?
 
<EOS>
if
the
footman
trod
heavily
in
creaking
boots
,
or
if
the
laundress
's
work
was
unsatisfactory
,
the
maid
said
,
"
This
will
never
do
for
Miss
Harleth
"
;
if
the
wood
smoked
in
the
bedroom
fireplace
,
Mrs.
Davilow
,
whose
own
weak
eyes
suffered
much
from
this
inconvenience
,
spoke
apologetically
of
it
to
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
If
,
when
they
were
under
the
stress
of
traveling
,
she
did
not
appear
at
the
breakfast
table
till
every
one
else
had
finished
,
the
only
question
was
,
how
Gwendolen
's
coffee
and
toast
should
still
be
of
the
hottest
and
crispest
;
and
when
she
appeared
with
her
freshly
-
brushed
light
-
brown
hair
streaming
backward
and
awaiting
her
mamma
's
hand
to
coil
it
up
,
her
large
brown
eyes
glancing
bright
as
a
wave
-
washed
onyx
from
under
their
long
lashes
,
it
was
always
she
herself
who
had
to
be
tolerant
 
to
beg
that
Alice
who
sat
waiting
on
her
would
not
stick
up
her
shoulders
in
that
frightful
manner
,
and
that
Isabel
,
instead
of
pushing
up
to
her
and
asking
questions
,
would
go
away
to
Miss
Merry
.
  
<EOS>
Always
she
was
the
princess
in
exile
,
who
in
time
of
famine
was
to
have
her
breakfast
-
roll
made
of
the
finest
-
bolted
flour
from
the
seven
thin
ears
of
wheat
,
and
in
a
general
decampment
was
to
have
her
silver
fork
kept
out
of
the
baggage
.
<EOS>
How
was
this
to
be
accounted
for
?
<EOS>
The
answer
may
seem
to
lie
quite
on
the
surface
:
 
in
her
beauty
,
a
certain
unusualness
about
her
,
a
decision
of
will
which
made
itself
felt
in
her
graceful
movements
and
clear
unhesitating
tones
,
so
that
if
she
came
into
the
room
on
a
rainy
day
when
everybody
else
was
flaccid
and
the
use
of
things
in
general
was
not
apparent
to
them
,
there
seemed
to
be
a
sudden
,
sufficient
reason
for
keeping
up
the
forms
of
life
;
and
even
the
waiters
at
hotels
showed
the
more
alacrity
in
doing
away
with
crumbs
and
creases
and
dregs
with
struggling
flies
in
them
.
<EOS>
This
potent
charm
,
added
to
the
fact
that
she
was
the
eldest
daughter
,
toward
whom
her
mamma
had
always
been
in
an
apologetic
state
of
mind
for
the
evils
brought
on
her
by
a
step
-
father
,
may
seem
so
full
a
reason
for
Gwendolen
's
domestic
empire
,
that
to
look
for
any
other
would
be
to
ask
the
reason
of
daylight
when
the
sun
is
shining
.
<EOS>
But
beware
of
arriving
at
conclusions
without
comparison
.
<EOS>
I
remember
having
seen
the
same
assiduous
,
apologetic
attention
awarded
to
persons
who
were
not
at
all
beautiful
or
unusual
,
whose
firmness
showed
itself
in
no
very
graceful
or
euphonious
way
,
and
who
were
not
eldest
daughters
with
a
tender
,
timid
mother
,
compunctious
at
having
subjected
them
to
inconveniences
.
<EOS>
Some
of
them
were
a
very
common
sort
of
men
.
<EOS>
And
the
only
point
of
resemblance
among
them
all
was
a
strong
determination
to
have
what
was
pleasant
,
with
a
total
fearlessness
in
making
themselves
disagreeable
or
dangerous
when
they
did
not
get
it
.
<EOS>
Who
is
so
much
cajoled
and
served
with
trembling
by
the
weak
females
of
a
household
as
the
unscrupulous
male
 
capable
,
if
he
has
not
free
way
at
home
,
of
going
and
doing
worse
elsewhere
?
<EOS>
Hence
I
am
forced
to
doubt
whether
even
without
her
potent
charm
and
peculiar
filial
position
<EOS>
Gwendolen
might
not
still
have
played
the
queen
in
exile
,
if
only
she
had
kept
her
inborn
energy
of
egoistic
desire
,
and
her
power
of
inspiring
fear
as
to
what
she
might
say
or
do
.
<EOS>
However
,
she
had
the
charm
,
and
those
who
feared
her
were
also
fond
of
her
;
the
fear
and
the
fondness
being
perhaps
both
heightened
by
what
may
be
called
the
iridescence
of
her
character
 
the
play
of
various
,
nay
,
contrary
tendencies
.
<EOS>
For
Macbeth
's
rhetoric
about
the
impossibility
of
being
many
opposite
things
in
the
same
moment
,
referred
to
the
clumsy
necessities
of
action
and
not
to
the
subtler
possibilities
of
feeling
.
<EOS>
We
can
not
speak
a
loyal
word
and
be
meanly
silent
;
we
can
not
kill
and
not
kill
in
the
same
moment
;
but
a
moment
is
wide
enough
for
the
loyal
and
mean
desire
,
for
the
outlash
of
a
murderous
thought
and
the
sharp
backward
stroke
of
repentance
.

<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
reception
in
the
neighborhood
fulfilled
her
uncle
's
expectations
.
<EOS>
From
Brackenshaw
Castle
to
the
Firs
at
Wanchester
,
where
Mr.
Quallon
the
banker
kept
a
generous
house
,
she
was
welcomed
with
manifest
admiration
,
and
even
those
ladies
who
did
not
quite
like
her
,
felt
a
comfort
in
having
a
new
,
striking
girl
to
invite
;
for
hostesses
who
entertain
much
must
make
up
their
parties
as
ministers
make
up
their
cabinets
,
on
grounds
other
than
personal
liking
.
<EOS>
Then
,
in
order
to
have
Gwendolen
as
a
guest
,
it
was
not
necessary
to
ask
any
one
who
was
disagreeable
,
for
Mrs.
Davilow
always
made
a
quiet
,
picturesque
figure
as
a
chaperon
,
and
Mr.
Gascoigne
was
everywhere
in
request
for
his
own
sake
.
  
<EOS>
Among
the
houses
where
Gwendolen
was
not
quite
liked
,
and
yet
invited
,
was
Quetcham
Hall
.
<EOS>
One
of
her
first
invitations
was
to
a
large
dinner
-
party
there
,
which
made
a
sort
of
general
introduction
for
her
to
the
society
of
the
neighborhood
;
for
in
a
select
party
of
thirty
and
of
well
-
composed
proportions
as
to
age
,
few
visitable
families
could
be
entirely
left
out
.
<EOS>
No
youthful
figure
there
was
comparable
to
Gwendolen
's
as
she
passed
through
the
long
suite
of
rooms
adorned
with
light
and
flowers
,
and
,
visible
at
first
as
a
slim
figure
floating
along
in
white
drapery
,
approached
through
one
wide
doorway
after
another
into
fuller
illumination
and
definiteness
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
had
that
sort
of
promenade
before
,
and
she
felt
exultingly
that
it
befitted
her
:
<EOS>
any
one
looking
at
her
for
the
first
time
might
have
supposed
that
long
galleries
and
lackeys
had
always
been
a
matter
of
course
in
her
life
;
while
her
cousin
Anna
,
who
was
really
more
familiar
with
these
things
,
felt
almost
as
much
embarrassed
as
a
rabbit
suddenly
deposited
in
that
well
-
lit
-
space
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
that
with
Gascoigne
?
"
said
the
archdeacon
,
neglecting
a
discussion
of
military
manoeuvres
on
which
,
as
a
clergyman
,
he
was
naturally
appealed
to
.
<EOS>
And
his
son
,
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
 
a
hopeful
young
scholar
,
who
had
already
suggested
some
"
not
less
elegant
than
ingenious
,
"
emendations
of
Greek
texts
 
said
nearly
at
the
same
time
,
"
By
George
!
<EOS>
who
is
that
girl
with
the
awfully
well
-
set
head
and
jolly
figure
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
to
a
mind
of
general
benevolence
,
wishing
everybody
to
look
well
,
it
was
rather
exasperating
to
see
how
Gwendolen
eclipsed
others
:
how
even
the
handsome
Miss
Lawe
,
explained
to
be
the
daughter
of
Lady
Lawe
,
looked
suddenly
broad
,
heavy
and
inanimate
;
and
how
Miss
Arrowpoint
,
unfortunately
also
dressed
in
white
,
immediately
resembled
a
_
carte
-
de
-
visite
_
in
which
one
would
fancy
the
skirt
alone
to
have
been
charged
for
.
<EOS>
Since
Miss
Arrowpoint
was
generally
liked
for
the
amiable
unpretending
way
in
which
she
wore
her
fortunes
,
and
made
a
softening
screen
for
the
oddities
of
her
mother
,
there
seemed
to
be
some
unfitness
in
Gwendolen
's
looking
so
much
more
like
a
person
of
social
importance
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
not
really
so
handsome
if
you
come
to
examine
her
features
,
"
said
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
,
later
in
the
evening
,
confidentially
to
Mrs.
Vulcany
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
certain
style
she
has
,
which
produces
a
great
effect
at
first
,
but
afterward
she
is
less
agreeable
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
fact
,
Gwendolen
,
not
intending
it
,
but
intending
the
contrary
,
had
offended
her
hostess
,
who
,
though
not
a
splenetic
or
vindictive
woman
,
had
her
susceptibilities
.
<EOS>
Several
conditions
had
met
in
the
Lady
of
Quetcham
which
to
the
reasoners
in
that
neighborhood
seemed
to
have
an
essential
connection
with
each
other
.
<EOS>
It
was
occasionally
recalled
that
she
had
been
the
heiress
of
a
fortune
gained
by
some
moist
or
dry
business
in
the
city
,
in
order
fully
to
account
for
her
having
a
squat
figure
,
a
harsh
parrot
-
like
voice
,
and
a
systematically
high
head
-
dress
;
and
since
these
points
made
her
externally
rather
ridiculous
,
it
appeared
to
many
only
natural
that
she
should
have
what
are
called
literary
tendencies
.
<EOS>
A
little
comparison
would
have
shown
that
all
these
points
are
to
be
found
apart
;
daughters
of
aldermen
being
often
well
-
grown
and
well
-
featured
,
pretty
women
having
sometimes
harsh
or
husky
voices
,
and
the
production
of
feeble
literature
being
found
compatible
with
the
most
diverse
forms
of
_
physique
_
,
masculine
as
well
as
feminine
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
who
had
a
keen
sense
of
absurdity
in
others
,
but
was
kindly
disposed
toward
any
one
who
could
make
life
agreeable
to
her
,
meant
to
win
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
by
giving
her
an
interest
and
attention
beyond
what
others
were
probably
inclined
to
show
.
<EOS>
But
self
-
confidence
is
apt
to
address
itself
to
an
imaginary
dullness
in
others
;
as
people
who
are
well
off
speak
in
a
cajoling
tone
to
the
poor
,
and
those
who
are
in
the
prime
of
life
raise
their
voice
and
talk
artificially
to
seniors
,
hastily
conceiving
them
to
be
deaf
and
rather
imbecile
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
with
all
her
cleverness
and
purpose
to
be
agreeable
,
could
not
escape
that
form
of
stupidity
:
it
followed
in
her
mind
,
unreflectingly
,
that
because
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
was
ridiculous
she
was
also
likely
to
be
wanting
in
penetration
,
and
she
went
through
her
little
scenes
without
suspicion
that
the
various
shades
of
her
behavior
were
all
noted
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
fond
of
books
as
well
as
of
music
,
riding
,
and
archery
<EOS>
,
I
hear
,
"
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
said
,
going
to
her
for
a
_
tete
-
à
-
tete
_
in
the
drawing
-
room
after
dinner
.
"
<EOS>
Catherine
will
be
very
glad
to
have
so
sympathetic
a
neighbor
.
<EOS>
"
This
little
speech
might
have
seemed
the
most
graceful
politeness
,
spoken
in
a
low
,
melodious
tone
;
but
with
a
twang
,
fatally
loud
,
it
gave
Gwendolen
a
sense
of
exercising
patronage
when
she
answered
,
gracefully
:
  
"
It
is
I
who
am
fortunate
.
<EOS>
Miss
Arrowpoint
will
teach
me
what
good
music
is
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
entirely
a
learner
.
<EOS>
I
hear
that
she
is
a
thorough
musician
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Catherine
has
certainly
had
every
advantage
.
<EOS>
We
have
a
first
-
rate
musician
in
the
house
now
 
Herr
Klesmer
;
perhaps
you
know
all
his
compositions
.
<EOS>
You
must
allow
me
to
introduce
him
to
you
.
<EOS>
You
sing
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
Catherine
plays
three
instruments
,
but
she
does
not
sing
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
let
us
hear
you
.
<EOS>
I
understand
you
are
an
accomplished
singer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
!
 
<EOS>
"
die
Kraft
ist
schwach
,
allein
die
Lust
ist
gross
,
"
as
Mephistopheles
says
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ah
,
you
are
a
student
of
Goethe
.
<EOS>
Young
ladies
are
so
advanced
now
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
have
read
everything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
really
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
so
glad
if
you
will
tell
me
what
to
read
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
looking
into
all
the
books
in
the
library
at
Offendene
,
but
there
is
nothing
readable
.
<EOS>
The
leaves
all
stick
together
and
smell
musty
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
write
books
to
amuse
myself
,
as
you
can
!
<EOS>
How
delightful
it
must
be
to
write
books
after
one
's
own
taste
instead
of
reading
other
people
's
!
<EOS>
Home
-
made
books
must
be
so
nice
.
"
  
<EOS>
For
an
instant
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
's
glance
was
a
little
sharper
,
but
the
perilous
resemblance
to
satire
in
the
last
sentence
took
the
hue
of
girlish
simplicity
when
Gwendolen
added
    
<EOS>
"
I
would
give
anything
to
write
a
book
!
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
why
should
you
not
?
"
said
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
,
encouragingly
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
but
to
begin
as
I
did
.
<EOS>
Pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
are
at
everybody
's
command
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
send
you
all
I
have
written
with
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thanks
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
so
glad
to
read
your
writings
.
<EOS>
Being
acquainted
with
authors
must
give
a
peculiar
understanding
of
their
books
:
one
would
be
able
to
tell
then
which
parts
were
funny
and
which
serious
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
often
laugh
in
the
wrong
place
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
Gwendolen
herself
became
aware
of
danger
,
and
added
quickly
,
"
In
Shakespeare
,
you
know
,
and
other
great
writers
that
we
can
never
see
.
<EOS>
But
I
always
want
to
know
more
than
there
is
in
the
books
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
interested
in
any
of
my
subjects
I
can
lend
you
many
extra
sheets
in
manuscript
,
"
said
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
 
while
Gwendolen
felt
herself
painfully
in
the
position
of
the
young
lady
who
professed
to
like
potted
sprats
.
  
<EOS>
"
These
are
things
I
dare
<EOS>
say
I
shall
publish
eventually
:
several
friends
have
urged
me
to
do
so
,
and
one
does
n't
like
to
be
obstinate
.
<EOS>
My
Tasso
,
for
example
 
I
could
have
made
it
twice
the
size
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
dote
on
Tasso
,
"
said
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
you
shall
have
all
my
papers
,
if
you
like
.
<EOS>
So
many
,
you
know
,
have
written
about
Tasso
;
but
they
are
all
wrong
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
particular
nature
of
his
madness
,
and
his
feelings
for
Leonora
,
and
the
real
cause
of
his
imprisonment
,
and
the
character
of
Leonora
,
who
,
in
my
opinion
,
was
a
cold
-
hearted
woman
,
else
she
would
have
married
him
in
spite
of
her
brother
 
<EOS>
they
are
all
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
differ
from
everybody
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
very
interesting
!
"
said
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
I
like
to
differ
from
everybody
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
is
so
stupid
to
agree
.
<EOS>
That
is
the
worst
of
writing
your
opinions
;
and
make
people
agree
with
you
.
"
<EOS>
This
speech
renewed
a
slight
suspicion
in
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
,
and
again
her
glance
became
for
a
moment
examining
.
<EOS>
But
Gwendolen
looked
very
innocent
,
and
continued
with
a
docile
air
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
of
Tasso
except
the
_
Gerusalemme
Liberata
_
,
which
we
read
and
learned
by
heart
at
school
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
his
life
is
more
interesting
than
his
poetry
,
I
have
constructed
the
early
part
of
his
life
as
a
sort
of
romance
.
<EOS>
When
one
thinks
of
his
father
Bernardo
,
and
so
on
,
there
is
much
that
must
be
true
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Imagination
is
often
truer
than
fact
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
decisively
,
though
she
could
no
more
have
explained
these
glib
words
than
if
they
had
been
Coptic
or
Etruscan
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
so
glad
to
learn
all
about
Tasso
 
and
his
madness
especially
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
poets
are
always
a
little
mad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
 
"
the
poet
's
eye
in
a
fine
frenzy
rolling
"
;
and
somebody
says
of
Marlowe
      
<EOS>
"
For
that
fine
madness
still
he
did
maintain
,
  
Which
always
should
possess
the
poet
's
brain
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
it
was
not
always
found
out
,
was
it
?
"
said
Gwendolen
innocently
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
some
of
them
rolled
their
eyes
in
private
.
<EOS>
Mad
people
are
often
very
cunning
.
"
  
<EOS>
Again
a
shade
flitted
over
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
's
face
;
but
the
entrance
of
the
gentlemen
prevented
any
immediate
mischief
between
her
and
this
too
quick
young
lady
,
who
had
over
-
acted
her
_
naïveté
_
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
here
comes
Herr
Klesmer
,
"
said
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
,
rising
;
and
presently
bringing
him
to
Gwendolen
,
she
left
them
to
a
dialogue
which
was
agreeable
on
both
sides
,
Herr
Klesmer
being
a
felicitous
combination
of
the
German
,
the
Sclave
and
the
Semite
,
with
grand
features
,
brown
hair
floating
in
artistic
fashion
,
and
brown
eyes
in
spectacles
.
<EOS>
His
English
had
little
foreignness
except
its
fluency
;
and
his
alarming
cleverness
was
made
less
formidable
just
then
by
a
certain
softening
air
of
silliness
which
will
sometimes
befall
even
genius
in
the
desire
of
being
agreeable
to
beauty
.
  
<EOS>
Music
was
soon
begun
.
<EOS>
Miss
Arrowpoint
and
Herr
Klesmer
played
a
four
-
handed
piece
on
two
pianos
,
which
convinced
the
company
in
general
that
it
was
long
,
and
Gwendolen
in
particular
that
the
neutral
,
placid
-
faced
Miss
Arrowpoint
had
a
mastery
of
the
instrument
which
put
her
own
execution
out
of
question
 
though
she
was
not
discouraged
as
to
her
often
-
praised
touch
and
style
.
<EOS>
After
this
every
one
became
anxious
to
hear
Gwendolen
sing
;
especially
Mr.
Arrowpoint
;
as
was
natural
in
a
host
and
a
perfect
gentleman
,
of
whom
no
one
had
anything
to
say
but
that
he
married
Miss
Cuttler
and
imported
the
best
cigars
;
and
he
led
her
to
the
piano
with
easy
politeness
.
<EOS>
Herr
Klesmer
closed
the
instrument
in
readiness
for
her
,
and
smiled
with
pleasure
at
her
approach
;
then
placed
himself
at
a
distance
of
a
few
feet
so
that
he
could
see
her
as
she
sang
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
was
not
nervous
;
what
she
undertook
to
do
she
did
without
trembling
,
and
singing
was
an
enjoyment
to
her
.
<EOS>
Her
voice
was
a
moderately
powerful
soprano
<EOS>
(
some
one
had
told
her
it
was
like
Jenny
Lind
's
)
,
her
ear
good
,
and
she
was
able
to
keep
in
tune
,
so
that
her
singing
gave
pleasure
to
ordinary
hearers
,
and
she
had
been
used
to
unmingled
applause
.
<EOS>
She
had
the
rare
advantage
of
looking
almost
prettier
when
she
was
singing
than
at
other
times
,
and
that
Herr
Klesmer
was
in
front
of
her
seemed
not
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
Her
song
,
determined
on
beforehand
,
was
a
favorite
aria
of
Belini
's
,
in
which
she
felt
quite
sure
of
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Charming
?
"
said
Mr.
Arrowpoint
,
who
had
remained
near
,
and
the
word
was
echoed
around
without
more
insincerity
than
we
recognize
in
a
brotherly
way
as
human
.
<EOS>
But
Herr
Klesmer
stood
like
a
statue
 
if
a
statue
can
be
imagined
in
spectacles
;
at
least
,
he
was
as
mute
as
a
statue
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
was
pressed
to
keep
her
seat
and
double
the
general
pleasure
,
and
she
did
not
wish
to
refuse
;
but
before
resolving
to
do
so
,
she
moved
a
little
toward
Herr
Klesmer
,
saying
with
a
look
of
smiling
appeal
,
"
It
would
be
too
cruel
to
a
great
musician
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
like
to
hear
poor
amateur
singing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
truly
;
but
that
makes
nothing
,
"
said
Herr
Klesmer
,
suddenly
speaking
in
an
odious
German
fashion
with
staccato
endings
,
quite
unobservable
in
him
before
,
and
apparently
depending
on
a
change
of
mood
,
as
Irishmen
resume
their
strongest
brogue
when
they
are
fervid
or
quarrelsome
.
<EOS>
"
That
makes
nothing
.
<EOS>
It
is
always
acceptable
to
see
you
sing
.
"
  
<EOS>
Was
there
ever
so
unexpected
an
assertion
of
superiority
?
<EOS>
at
least
before
the
late
Teutonic
conquest
?
<EOS>
Gwendolen
colored
deeply
,
but
,
with
her
usual
presence
of
mind
,
did
not
show
an
ungraceful
resentment
by
moving
away
immediately
;
and
Miss
Arrowpoint
,
who
had
been
near
enough
to
overhear
(
and
also
to
observe
that
Herr
Klesmer
's
mode
of
looking
at
Gwendolen
was
more
conspicuously
admiring
than
was
quite
consistent
with
good
taste
)
,
now
with
the
utmost
tact
and
kindness
came
close
to
her
and
said
    
"
Imagine
what
I
have
to
go
through
with
this
professor
!
<EOS>
He
can
hardly
tolerate
anything
we
English
do
in
music
.
<EOS>
We
can
only
put
up
with
his
severity
,
and
make
use
of
it
to
find
out
the
worst
that
can
be
said
of
us
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
little
comfort
to
know
that
;
and
one
can
bear
it
when
every
one
else
is
admiring
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
very
much
obliged
to
him
for
telling
me
the
worst
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
recovering
herself
.
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
I
have
been
extremely
ill
taught
,
in
addition
to
having
no
talent
 
only
liking
for
music
.
<EOS>
"
This
was
very
well
expressed
considering
that
it
had
never
entered
her
mind
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
is
true
:
<EOS>
you
have
not
been
well
taught
,
"
said
Herr
Klesmer
,
quietly
.
<EOS>
Woman
was
dear
to
him
,
but
music
was
dearer
.
"
<EOS>
Still
,
you
are
not
quite
without
gifts
.
<EOS>
You
sing
in
tune
,
and
you
have
a
pretty
fair
organ
.
<EOS>
But
you
produce
your
notes
badly
;
and
that
music
which
you
sing
is
beneath
you
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
form
of
melody
which
expresses
a
puerile
state
of
culture
 
a
dawdling
,
canting
,
see
-
saw
kind
of
stuff
 
the
passion
and
thought
of
people
without
any
breadth
of
horizon
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
sort
of
self
-
satisfied
folly
about
every
phrase
of
such
melody
;
no
cries
of
deep
,
mysterious
passion
 
<EOS>
no
conflict
 
<EOS>
no
sense
of
the
universal
.
<EOS>
It
makes
men
small
as
they
listen
to
it
.
<EOS>
Sing
now
something
larger
.
<EOS>
And
I
shall
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
not
now
 
by
-
and
-
by
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
with
a
sinking
of
heart
at
the
sudden
width
of
horizon
opened
round
her
small
musical
performance
.
<EOS>
For
a
lady
desiring
to
lead
,
this
first
encounter
in
her
campaign
was
startling
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
bent
on
not
behaving
foolishly
,
and
Miss
Arrowpoint
helped
her
by
saying
    
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
by
-
and
-
by
.
<EOS>
I
always
require
half
an
hour
to
get
up
my
courage
after
being
criticised
by
Herr
Klesmer
.
<EOS>
We
will
ask
him
to
play
to
us
now
:
he
is
bound
to
show
us
what
is
good
music
.
<EOS>
"
  
To
be
quite
safe
on
this
point
Herr
Klesmer
played
a
composition
of
his
own
,
a
fantasia
called
_
Freudvoll
,
Leidvoll
,
Gedankenvoll
<EOS>
_
 
<EOS>
an
extensive
commentary
on
some
melodic
ideas
not
too
grossly
evident
;
and
he
certainly
fetched
as
much
variety
and
depth
of
passion
out
of
the
piano
as
that
moderately
responsive
instrument
lends
itself
to
,
having
an
imperious
magic
in
his
fingers
that
seem
to
send
a
nerve
-
thrill
through
ivory
key
and
wooden
hammer
,
and
compel
the
strings
to
make
a
quivering
lingering
speech
for
him
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
in
spite
of
her
wounded
egoism
,
had
fullness
of
nature
enough
to
feel
the
power
of
this
playing
,
and
it
gradually
turned
her
inward
sob
of
mortification
into
an
excitement
which
lifted
her
for
the
moment
into
a
desperate
indifference
about
her
own
doings
,
or
at
least
a
determination
to
get
a
superiority
over
them
by
laughing
at
them
as
if
they
belonged
to
somebody
else
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
had
become
brighter
,
her
cheeks
slightly
flushed
,
and
her
tongue
ready
for
any
mischievous
remarks
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
would
sing
to
us
again
,
Miss
Harleth
,
"
said
young
Clintock
,
the
archdeacon
's
classical
son
,
who
had
been
so
fortunate
as
to
take
her
to
dinner
,
and
came
up
to
renew
conversation
as
soon
as
Herr
Klesmer
's
performance
was
ended
,
"
That
is
the
style
of
music
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
never
can
make
anything
of
this
tip
-
top
playing
.
<EOS>
It
is
like
a
jar
of
leeches
,
where
you
can
never
tell
either
beginnings
or
endings
.
<EOS>
I
could
listen
to
your
singing
all
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
we
should
be
glad
of
something
popular
now
 
<EOS>
another
song
from
you
would
be
a
relaxation
,
"
said
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
,
who
had
also
come
near
with
polite
intentions
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
must
be
because
you
are
in
a
puerile
state
of
culture
,
and
have
no
breadth
of
horizon
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
learned
that
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
taught
how
bad
my
taste
is
,
and
am
feeling
growing
pains
.
<EOS>
They
are
never
pleasant
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
not
taking
any
notice
of
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
,
and
looking
up
with
a
bright
smile
at
young
Clintock
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
was
not
insensible
to
this
rudeness
,
but
merely
said
,
"
Well
,
we
will
not
press
anything
disagreeably
,
"
and
as
there
was
a
perceptible
outburst
of
imprisoned
conversation
just
then
,
and
a
movement
of
guests
seeking
each
other
,
she
remained
seated
where
she
was
,
and
looked
around
her
with
the
relief
of
a
hostess
at
finding
she
is
not
needed
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
you
like
this
neighborhood
,
"
said
young
Clintock
,
well
-
pleased
with
his
station
in
front
of
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
"
Exceedingly
.
<EOS>
There
seems
to
be
a
little
of
everything
and
not
much
of
anything
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
rather
equivocal
praise
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
like
a
little
of
everything
;
a
little
absurdity
,
for
example
,
is
very
amusing
.
<EOS>
I
am
thankful
for
a
few
queer
people
;
but
much
of
them
is
a
bore
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
(
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
,
who
was
hearing
this
dialogue
,
perceived
quite
a
new
tone
in
Gwendolen
's
speech
,
and
felt
a
revival
of
doubt
as
to
her
interest
in
Tasso
's
madness
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
there
should
be
more
croquet
,
for
one
thing
,
"
young
Clintock
;
"
I
am
usually
away
,
but
if
I
were
more
here
I
should
go
in
for
a
croquet
club
.
<EOS>
You
are
one
of
the
archers
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
But
depend
upon
it
croquet
is
the
game
of
the
future
.
<EOS>
It
wants
writing
up
,
though
.
<EOS>
One
of
our
best
men
has
written
a
poem
on
it
,
in
four
cantos
;
 
as
good
as
Pope
.
<EOS>
I
want
him
to
publish
it
 
<EOS>
You
never
read
anything
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
study
croquet
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
I
shall
take
to
it
instead
of
singing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
not
that
;
but
do
take
to
croquet
.
<EOS>
I
will
send
you
Jenning
's
poem
if
you
like
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
manuscript
copy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
he
a
great
friend
of
yours
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
rather
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
if
he
is
only
rather
,
I
think
I
will
decline
.
<EOS>
Or
,
if
you
send
it
to
me
,
will
you
promise
not
to
catechise
me
upon
it
and
ask
me
which
part
I
like
best
?
<EOS>
Because
it
is
not
so
easy
to
know
a
poem
without
reading
it
as
to
know
a
sermon
without
listening
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Decidedly
,
"
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
thought
,
"
this
girl
is
double
and
satirical
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
on
my
guard
against
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
Gwendolen
,
nevertheless
,
continued
to
receive
polite
attentions
from
the
family
at
Quetcham
,
not
merely
because
invitations
have
larger
grounds
than
those
of
personal
liking
,
but
because
the
trying
little
scene
at
the
piano
had
awakened
a
kindly
solicitude
toward
her
in
the
gentle
mind
of
Miss
Arrowpoint
,
who
managed
all
the
invitations
and
visits
,
her
mother
being
otherwise
occupied
.

<EOS>
That
lofty
criticism
had
caused
Gwendolen
a
new
sort
of
pain
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
have
chosen
to
confess
how
unfortunate
she
thought
herself
in
not
having
had
Miss
Arrowpoint
's
musical
advantages
,
so
as
to
be
able
to
question
Herr
Klesmer
's
taste
with
the
confidence
of
thorough
knowledge
;
still
less
,
to
admit
even
to
herself
that
Miss
Arrowpoint
each
time
they
met
raised
an
unwonted
feeling
of
jealousy
in
her
:
not
in
the
least
because
she
was
an
heiress
,
but
because
it
was
really
provoking
that
a
girl
whose
appearance
you
could
not
characterize
except
by
saying
that
her
figure
was
slight
and
of
middle
stature
,
her
features
small
,
her
eyes
tolerable
,
and
her
complexion
sallow
,
had
nevertheless
a
certain
mental
superiority
which
could
not
be
explained
away
 
an
exasperating
thoroughness
in
her
musical
accomplishment
,
a
fastidious
discrimination
in
her
general
tastes
,
which
made
it
impossible
to
force
her
admiration
and
kept
you
in
awe
of
her
standard
.
<EOS>
This
insignificant
-
looking
young
lady
of
four
-
and
-
twenty
,
whom
any
one
's
eyes
would
have
passed
over
negligently
if
she
had
not
been
Miss
Arrowpoint
,
might
be
suspected
of
a
secret
opinion
that
Miss
Harleth
's
acquirements
were
rather
of
a
common
order
,
and
such
an
opinion
was
not
made
agreeable
to
think
of
by
being
always
veiled
under
a
perfect
kindness
of
manner
.
  
<EOS>
But
Gwendolen
did
not
like
to
dwell
on
facts
which
threw
an
unfavorable
light
on
itself
.
<EOS>
The
musical
Magus
who
had
so
suddenly
widened
her
horizon
was
not
always
on
the
scene
;
and
his
being
constantly
backward
and
forward
between
London
and
Quetcham
soon
began
to
be
thought
of
as
offering
opportunities
for
converting
him
to
a
more
admiring
state
of
mind
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
in
the
manifest
pleasure
her
singing
gave
at
Brackenshaw
Castle
,
the
Firs
,
and
elsewhere
,
she
recovered
her
equanimity
,
being
disposed
to
think
approval
more
trustworthy
than
objection
,
and
not
being
one
of
the
exceptional
persons
who
have
a
parching
thirst
for
a
perfection
undemanded
by
their
neighbors
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
would
have
been
rash
to
say
then
that
she
was
at
all
exceptional
inwardly
,
or
that
the
unusual
in
her
was
more
than
her
rare
grace
of
movement
and
bearing
,
and
a
certain
daring
which
gave
piquancy
to
a
very
common
egoistic
ambition
,
such
as
exists
under
many
clumsy
exteriors
and
is
taken
no
notice
of
.
<EOS>
For
I
suppose
that
the
set
of
the
head
does
not
really
determine
the
hunger
of
the
inner
self
for
supremacy
<EOS>
:
it
only
makes
a
difference
sometimes
as
to
the
way
in
which
the
supremacy
is
held
attainable
,
and
a
little
also
to
the
degree
in
which
it
can
be
attained
;
especially
when
the
hungry
one
is
a
girl
,
whose
passion
for
doing
what
is
remarkable
has
an
ideal
limit
in
consistency
with
the
highest
breeding
and
perfect
freedom
from
the
sordid
need
of
income
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
was
as
inwardly
rebellious
against
the
restraints
of
family
conditions
,
and
as
ready
to
look
through
obligations
into
her
own
fundamental
want
of
feeling
for
them
,
as
if
she
had
been
sustained
by
the
boldest
speculations
;
but
she
really
had
no
such
speculations
,
and
would
at
once
have
marked
herself
off
from
any
sort
of
theoretical
or
practically
reforming
women
by
satirizing
them
.
<EOS>
She
rejoiced
to
feel
herself
exceptional
;
but
her
horizon
was
that
of
the
genteel
romance
where
the
heroine
's
soul
poured
out
in
her
journal
is
full
of
vague
power
,
originality
,
and
general
rebellion
,
while
her
life
moves
strictly
in
the
sphere
of
fashion
;
and
if
she
wanders
into
a
swamp
,
the
pathos
lies
partly
,
so
to
speak
,
in
her
having
on
her
satin
shoes
.
<EOS>
Here
is
a
restraint
which
nature
and
society
have
provided
on
the
pursuit
of
striking
adventure
;
so
that
a
soul
burning
with
a
sense
of
what
the
universe
is
not
,
and
ready
to
take
all
existence
as
fuel
,
is
nevertheless
held
captive
by
the
ordinary
wirework
of
social
forms
and
does
nothing
particular
.
  
<EOS>
This
commonplace
result
was
what
Gwendolen
found
herself
threatened
with
even
in
the
novelty
of
the
first
winter
at
Offendene
.
<EOS>
What
she
was
clear
upon
was
,
that
she
did
not
wish
to
lead
the
same
sort
of
life
as
ordinary
young
ladies
did
;
but
what
she
was
not
clear
upon
was
,
how
she
should
set
about
leading
any
other
,
and
what
were
the
particular
acts
which
she
would
assert
her
freedom
by
doing
.
<EOS>
Offendene
remained
a
good
background
,
if
anything
would
happen
there
;
but
on
the
whole
the
neighborhood
was
in
fault
.
  
<EOS>
Beyond
the
effect
of
her
beauty
on
a
first
presentation
,
there
was
not
much
excitement
to
be
got
out
of
her
earliest
invitations
,
and
she
came
home
after
little
sallies
of
satire
and
knowingness
,
such
as
had
offended
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
,
to
fill
the
intervening
days
with
the
most
girlish
devices
.
<EOS>
The
strongest
assertion
<EOS>
she
was
able
to
make
of
her
individual
claims
was
to
leave
out
Alice
's
lessons
(
on
the
principle
that
Alice
was
more
likely
to
excel
in
ignorance
)
,
and
to
employ
her
with
Miss
Merry
,
and
the
maid
who
was
understood
to
wait
on
all
the
ladies
,
in
helping
to
arrange
various
dramatic
costumes
which
Gwendolen
pleased
herself
with
having
in
readiness
for
some
future
occasions
of
acting
in
charades
or
theatrical
pieces
,
occasions
which
she
meant
to
bring
about
by
force
of
will
or
contrivance
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
acted
 
only
made
a
figure
in
_
<EOS>
tableaux
vivans
_
at
school
;
but
<EOS>
she
felt
assured
that
she
could
act
well
,
and
having
been
once
or
twice
to
the
Théâtre
Français
,
and
also
heard
her
mamma
speak
of
Rachel
,
her
waking
dreams
and
cogitations
as
to
how
she
would
manage
her
destiny
sometimes
turned
on
the
question
whether
she
would
become
an
actress
like
Rachel
,
since
she
was
more
beautiful
than
that
thin
Jewess
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
the
wet
days
before
Christmas
were
passed
pleasantly
in
the
preparation
of
costumes
,
Greek
,
Oriental
,
and
Composite
,
in
which
Gwendolen
attitudinized
and
speechified
before
a
domestic
audience
,
including
even
the
housekeeper
,
who
was
once
pressed
into
it
that
she
might
swell
the
notes
of
applause
;
but
having
shown
herself
unworthy
by
observing
that
Miss
Harleth
looked
far
more
like
a
queen
in
her
own
dress
than
in
that
baggy
thing
with
her
arms
all
bare
,
she
was
not
invited
a
second
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
I
look
as
well
as
Rachel
,
mamma
?
"
said
Gwendolen
,
one
day
when
she
had
been
showing
herself
in
her
Greek
dress
to
Anna
,
and
going
through
scraps
of
scenes
with
much
tragic
intention
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
better
arms
than
Rachel
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
"
your
arms
would
do
for
anything
,
Gwen
.
<EOS>
But
your
voice
is
not
so
tragic
as
hers
;
it
is
not
so
deep
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
make
it
deeper
,
if
I
like
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
provisionally
;
then
she
added
,
with
decision
,
"
I
think
a
higher
voice
is
more
tragic
:
it
is
more
feminine
;
and
the
more
feminine
a
woman
is
,
<EOS>
the
more
tragic
it
seems
when
she
does
desperate
actions
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
may
be
something
in
that
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
languidly
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
n't
know
what
good
there
is
in
making
one
's
blood
creep
.
<EOS>
And
if
there
is
anything
horrible
to
be
done
,
I
should
like
it
to
be
left
to
the
men
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
mamma
,
you
are
so
dreadfully
prosaic
!
<EOS>
As
if
all
the
great
poetic
criminals
were
not
women
!
<EOS>
I
think
the
men
are
poor
cautious
creatures
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
dear
,
and
you
 
who
are
afraid
to
be
alone
in
the
night
 
I
do
n't
think
you
would
be
very
bold
in
crime
,
thank
God
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
talking
about
reality
,
mamma
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
Then
her
mamma
being
called
out
of
the
room
,
she
turned
quickly
to
her
cousin
,
as
if
taking
an
opportunity
,
and
said
,
"
Anna
,
do
ask
my
uncle
to
let
us
get
up
some
charades
at
the
rectory
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Middleton
and
Warham
could
act
with
us
 
just
for
practice
.
<EOS>
Mamma
says
it
will
not
do
to
have
Mr.
Middleton
consulting
and
rehearsing
here
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
stick
,
but
we
could
give
him
suitable
parts
.
<EOS>
Do
ask
,
or
else
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
not
till
Rex
comes
.
<EOS>
He
is
so
clever
,
and
such
a
dear
old
thing
,
and
he
will
act
Napoleon
looking
over
the
sea
.
<EOS>
He
looks
just
like
Napoleon
.
<EOS>
Rex
can
do
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
in
the
least
believe
in
your
Rex
,
Anna
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
laughing
at
her
.
"
<EOS>
He
will
turn
out
to
be
like
those
wretched
blue
and
yellow
water
-
colors
of
his
which
you
hang
up
in
your
bedroom
and
worship
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
you
will
see
,
"
said
Anna
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
that
I
know
what
is
clever
,
but
he
has
got
a
scholarship
already
,
and
papa
says
he
will
get
a
fellowship
,
and
nobody
is
better
at
games
.
<EOS>
He
is
cleverer
than
Mr.
Middleton
,
and
everybody
<EOS>
but
you
call
Mr.
Middleton
clever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
he
may
be
in
a
dark
-
lantern
sort
of
way
.
<EOS>
But
he
_
is
_
a
stick
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
to
say
,
"
Perdition
catch
my
soul
,
but
I
do
love
her
,
"
he
would
say
it
in
just
the
same
tone
as
,
"
Here
endeth
the
second
lesson
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
,
Gwendolen
!
"
said
Anna
,
shocked
at
these
promiscuous
allusions
.
<EOS>
"
And
it
is
very
unkind
of
you
to
speak
so
of
him
,
for
he
admires
you
very
much
.
<EOS>
I
heard
Warham
say
one
day
to
mamma
,
"
Middleton
is
regularly
spooney
upon
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
She
was
very
angry
with
him
;
but
I
know
what
it
means
.
<EOS>
It
is
what
they
say
at
college
for
being
in
love
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
help
it
?
"
said
Gwendolen
,
rather
contemptuously
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Perdition
catch
my
soul
if
I
love
_
him
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
of
course
;
papa
,
I
think
,
would
not
wish
it
.
<EOS>
And
he
is
to
go
away
soon
.
<EOS>
But
it
makes
me
sorry
when
you
ridicule
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
shall
you
do
to
me
when
I
ridicule
Rex
?
"
said
Gwendolen
,
wickedly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Gwendolen
,
dear
,
you
_
will
not
_
?
"
said
Anna
,
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
bear
it
.
<EOS>
But
there
really
is
nothing
in
him
to
ridicule
.
<EOS>
Only
you
may
find
out
things
.
<EOS>
For
no
one
ever
thought
of
laughing
at
Mr.
Middleton
before
you
.
<EOS>
Every
one
said
he
was
nice
-
looking
,
and
his
manners
perfect
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
have
always
been
frightened
at
him
because
of
his
learning
and
his
square
-
cut
coat
,
and
his
being
a
nephew
of
the
bishop
's
,
and
all
that
.
<EOS>
But
you
will
not
ridicule
<EOS>
Rex
 
promise
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Anna
ended
with
a
beseeching
look
which
touched
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
dear
little
coz
,
"
she
said
,
just
touching
the
tip
of
Anna
's
chin
with
her
thumb
and
forefinger
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
ever
want
to
do
anything
that
will
vex
you
.
<EOS>
Especially
if
Rex
is
to
make
everything
come
off
 
charades
and
everything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
when
at
last
Rex
was
there
,
the
animation
he
brought
into
the
life
of
Offendene
and
the
rectory
,
and
his
ready
partnership
in
Gwendolen
's
plans
,
left
her
no
inclination
for
any
ridicule
that
was
not
of
an
open
and
flattering
kind
,
such
as
he
himself
enjoyed
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
fine
open
-
hearted
youth
,
with
a
handsome
face
strongly
resembling
his
father
's
and
Anna
's
,
but
softer
in
expression
than
the
one
,
and
larger
in
scale
than
the
other
:
a
bright
,
healthy
,
loving
nature
,
enjoying
ordinary
innocent
things
so
much
that
vice
had
no
temptation
for
him
,
and
what
he
knew
of
it
lay
too
entirely
in
the
outer
courts
and
little
-
visited
chambers
of
his
mind
for
him
to
think
of
it
with
great
repulsion
.
<EOS>
Vicious
habits
were
with
him
"
<EOS>
what
some
fellows
did
"
 
"
stupid
stuff
"
which
he
liked
to
keep
aloof
from
.
<EOS>
He
returned
Anna
's
affection
as
fully
as
could
be
expected
of
a
brother
whose
pleasures
apart
from
her
were
more
than
the
sum
total
of
hers
;
and
he
had
never
known
a
stronger
love
.
  
<EOS>
The
cousins
were
continually
together
at
the
one
house
or
the
other
 
chiefly
at
Offendene
,
where
there
was
more
freedom
,
or
rather
where
there
was
a
more
complete
sway
for
Gwendolen
;
and
whatever
she
wished
became
a
ruling
purpose
for
Rex
.
<EOS>
The
charades
came
off
according
to
her
plans
;
and
also
some
other
little
scenes
not
contemplated
by
her
in
which
her
acting
was
more
impromptu
.
<EOS>
It
was
at
Offendene
that
the
charades
and
_
tableaux
<EOS>
_
were
rehearsed
and
presented
,
Mrs.
Davilow
seeing
no
objection
even
to
Mr.
Middleton
's
being
invited
to
share
in
them
,
now
that
Rex
too
was
there
 
especially
as
his
services
were
indispensable
:
Warham
,
who
was
studying
for
India
with
a
Wanchester
"
coach
,
"
having
no
time
to
spare
,
and
being
generally
dismal
under
a
cram
of
everything
except
the
answers
needed
at
the
forthcoming
examination
,
which
might
disclose
the
welfare
of
our
Indian
Empire
to
be
somehow
connected
with
a
quotable
knowledge
of
Browne
's
Pastorals
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Middleton
was
persuaded
to
play
various
grave
parts
,
Gwendolen
having
flattered
him
on
his
enviable
immobility
of
countenance
;
and
at
first
a
little
pained
and
jealous
at
her
comradeship
with
Rex
,
he
presently
drew
encouragement
from
the
thought
that
this
sort
of
cousinly
familiarity
excluded
any
serious
passion
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
occasionally
felt
that
her
more
formal
treatment
of
himself
was
such
a
sign
of
favor
as
to
warrant
his
making
advances
before
he
left
Pennicote
,
though
he
had
intended
to
keep
his
feelings
in
reserve
until
his
position
should
be
more
assured
.
<EOS>
Miss
Gwendolen
,
quite
aware
that
she
was
adored
by
this
unexceptionable
young
clergyman
with
pale
whiskers
and
square
-
cut
collar
<EOS>
,
felt
nothing
more
on
the
subject
than
that
she
had
no
objection
to
being
adored
:
she
turned
her
eyes
on
him
with
calm
mercilessness
and
caused
him
many
mildly
agitating
hopes
by
seeming
always
to
avoid
dramatic
contact
with
him
 
for
all
meanings
,
we
know
,
depend
on
the
key
of
interpretation
.
  
<EOS>
Some
persons
might
have
thought
beforehand
that
a
young
man
of
Anglican
leanings
,
having
a
sense
of
sacredness
much
exercised
on
small
things
as
well
as
great
,
rarely
laughing
save
from
politeness
,
and
in
general
regarding
the
mention
of
spades
by
their
naked
names
as
rather
coarse
,
would
not
have
seen
a
fitting
bride
for
himself
in
a
girl
who
was
daring
in
ridicule
,
and
showed
none
of
the
special
grace
required
in
the
clergyman
's
wife
;
or
,
that
a
young
man
informed
by
theological
reading
would
have
reflected
that
he
was
not
likely
to
meet
the
taste
of
a
lively
,
restless
young
lady
like
Miss
Harleth
.
<EOS>
But
are
we
always
obliged
to
explain
why
the
facts
are
not
what
some
persons
thought
beforehand
?
<EOS>
The
apology
lies
on
their
side
,
who
had
that
erroneous
way
of
thinking
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
Rex
,
who
would
possibly
have
been
sorry
for
poor
Middleton
if
he
had
been
aware
of
the
excellent
curate
's
inward
conflict
,
he
was
too
completely
absorbed
in
a
first
passion
to
have
observation
for
any
person
or
thing
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
observe
Gwendolen
;
he
only
felt
what
she
said
or
did
,
and
the
back
of
his
head
seemed
to
be
a
good
organ
of
information
as
to
whether
she
was
in
the
room
or
out
.
<EOS>
Before
the
end
of
the
first
fortnight
he
was
so
deeply
in
love
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
think
of
his
life
except
as
bound
up
with
Gwendolen
's
.
<EOS>
He
could
see
no
obstacles
,
poor
boy
;
his
own
love
seemed
a
guarantee
of
hers
,
since
it
was
one
with
the
unperturbed
delight
in
her
image
,
so
that
he
could
no
more
dream
of
her
giving
him
pain
than
an
Egyptian
could
dream
of
snow
.
<EOS>
She
sang
and
played
to
him
whenever
he
liked
,
was
always
glad
of
his
companionship
in
riding
,
though
his
borrowed
steeds
were
often
comic
,
was
ready
to
join
in
any
fun
of
his
,
and
showed
a
right
appreciation
of
Anna
.
<EOS>
No
mark
of
sympathy
seemed
absent
.
<EOS>
That
because
Gwendolen
was
the
most
perfect
creature
in
the
world
she
was
to
make
a
grand
match
,
had
not
occurred
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
conceit
 
at
least
not
more
than
goes
to
make
up
the
necessary
gum
and
consistence
of
a
substantial
personality
:
it
was
only
that
in
the
young
bliss
of
loving
he
took
Gwendolen
's
perfection
as
part
of
that
good
which
had
seemed
one
with
life
to
him
,
being
the
outcome
of
a
happy
,
well
-
embodied
nature
.
  
<EOS>
One
incident
which
happened
in
the
course
of
their
dramatic
attempts
impressed
Rex
as
a
sign
of
her
unusual
sensibility
.
<EOS>
It
showed
an
aspect
of
her
nature
which
could
not
have
been
preconceived
by
any
one
who
,
like
him
,
had
only
seen
her
habitual
fearlessness
in
active
exercises
and
her
high
spirits
in
society
.
  
<EOS>
After
a
good
deal
of
rehearsing
it
was
resolved
that
a
select
party
should
be
invited
to
Offendene
to
witness
the
performances
which
went
with
so
much
satisfaction
to
the
actors
.
<EOS>
Anna
had
caused
a
pleasant
surprise
;
nothing
could
be
neater
than
the
way
in
which
she
played
her
little
parts
;
one
would
even
have
suspected
her
of
hiding
much
sly
observation
under
her
simplicity
.
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Middleton
answered
very
well
by
not
trying
to
be
comic
.
<EOS>
The
main
source
of
doubt
and
retardation
had
been
Gwendolen
's
desire
to
appear
in
her
Greek
dress
.
<EOS>
No
word
for
a
charade
would
occur
to
her
either
waking
or
dreaming
that
suited
her
purpose
of
getting
a
statuesque
pose
in
this
favorite
costume
.
<EOS>
To
choose
a
motive
from
Racine
was
of
no
use
,
since
Rex
and
the
others
could
not
declaim
French
verse
,
and
improvised
speeches
would
turn
the
scene
into
burlesque
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
Mr.
Gascoigne
prohibited
the
acting
of
scenes
from
plays
:
he
usually
protested
against
the
notion
that
an
amusement
which
was
fitting
for
every
one
else
was
unfitting
for
a
clergyman
;
but
he
would
not
in
this
matter
overstep
the
line
of
decorum
as
drawn
in
that
part
of
Wessex
,
which
did
not
exclude
his
sanction
of
the
young
people
's
acting
charades
in
his
sister
-
in
-
law
's
house
 
a
very
different
affair
from
private
theatricals
in
the
full
sense
of
the
word
.
  
<EOS>
Everybody
of
course
was
concerned
to
satisfy
this
wish
of
Gwendolen
's
,
and
Rex
proposed
that
they
should
wind
up
with
a
tableau
in
which
the
effect
of
her
majesty
would
not
be
marred
by
any
one
's
speech
.
<EOS>
This
pleased
her
thoroughly
,
and
the
only
question
was
the
choice
of
the
tableau
.
  
<EOS>
"
Something
pleasant
,
children
,
I
beseech
you
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
;
"
I
ca
n't
have
any
Greek
wickedness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
no
worse
than
Christian
wickedness
,
mamma
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
whose
mention
of
Rachelesque
heroines
had
called
forth
that
remark
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
less
scandalous
,
"
said
Rex
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Besides
,
one
thinks
of
it
as
all
gone
by
and
done
with
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
say
to
Briseis
being
led
away
?
<EOS>
I
would
be
Achilles
,
and
you
would
be
looking
round
at
me
 
after
the
print
we
have
at
the
rectory
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
would
be
a
good
attitude
for
me
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
in
a
tone
of
acceptance
.
<EOS>
But
afterward
she
said
with
decision
,
"
No
.
<EOS>
It
will
not
do
.
<EOS>
There
must
be
three
men
in
proper
costume
,
else
it
will
be
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
it
,
"
said
Rex
,
after
a
little
reflection
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hermione
as
the
statue
in
Winter
's
Tale
?
<EOS>
I
will
be
Leontes
,
and
Miss
Merry
,
Paulina
,
one
on
each
side
.
<EOS>
Our
dress
wo
n't
signify
,
"
he
went
on
laughingly
;
"
it
will
be
more
Shakespearian
and
romantic
if
Leontes
looks
like
Napoleon
,
and
Paulina
like
a
modern
spinster
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
Hermione
was
chosen
;
all
agreeing
that
age
was
of
no
consequence
,
but
Gwendolen
urged
that
instead
of
the
mere
tableau
there
should
be
just
enough
acting
of
the
scene
to
introduce
the
striking
up
of
the
music
as
a
signal
for
her
to
step
down
and
advance
;
when
Leontes
,
instead
of
embracing
her
,
was
to
kneel
and
kiss
the
hem
of
her
garment
,
and
so
the
curtain
was
to
fall
.
<EOS>
The
antechamber
with
folding
doors
lent
itself
admirably
to
the
purpose
of
a
stage
,
and
the
whole
of
the
establishment
,
with
the
addition
of
Jarrett
the
village
carpenter
,
was
absorbed
in
the
preparations
for
an
entertainment
,
which
,
considering
that
it
was
an
imitation
of
acting
,
was
likely
to
be
successful
,
since
we
know
from
ancient
fable
that
an
imitation
may
have
more
chance
of
success
than
the
original
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
was
not
without
a
special
exultation
in
the
prospect
of
this
occasion
,
for
she
knew
that
Herr
Klesmer
was
again
at
Quetcham
,
and
she
had
taken
care
to
include
him
among
the
invited
.
  
<EOS>
Klesmer
came
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
one
of
his
placid
,
silent
moods
,
and
sat
in
serene
contemplation
,
replying
to
all
appeals
in
benignant
-
sounding
syllables
more
or
less
articulate
 
as
taking
up
his
cross
meekly
in
a
world
overgrown
with
amateurs
,
or
as
careful
how
he
moved
his
lion
paws
lest
he
should
crush
a
rampant
and
vociferous
mouse
.
  
<EOS>
Everything
indeed
went
off
smoothly
and
according
to
expectation
 
all
that
was
improvised
and
accidental
being
of
a
probable
sort
 
until
the
incident
occurred
which
showed
Gwendolen
in
an
unforeseen
phase
of
emotion
.
<EOS>
How
it
came
about
was
at
first
a
mystery
.
  
<EOS>
The
tableau
of
Hermione
was
doubly
striking
from
its
dissimilarity
with
what
had
gone
before
:
it
was
answering
perfectly
,
and
a
murmur
of
applause
had
been
gradually
suppressed
while
Leontes
gave
his
permission
that
Paulina
should
exercise
her
utmost
art
and
make
the
statue
move
.
  
<EOS>
Hermione
,
her
arm
resting
on
a
pillar
,
was
elevated
by
about
six
inches
,
which
she
counted
on
as
a
means
of
showing
her
pretty
foot
and
instep
,
when
at
the
given
signal
she
should
advance
and
descend
.
  
<EOS>
"
Music
,
awake
her
,
strike
!
"
<EOS>
said
Paulina
(
Mrs.
Davilow
,
who
,
by
special
entreaty
,
had
consented
to
take
the
part
in
a
white
burnous
and
hood
)
.
  
<EOS>
Herr
Klesmer
,
who
had
been
good
-
natured
enough
to
seat
himself
at
the
piano
,
struck
a
thunderous
chord
 
but
in
the
same
instant
,
and
before
Hermione
had
put
forth
her
foot
,
the
movable
panel
,
which
was
on
a
line
with
the
piano
,
flew
open
on
the
right
opposite
the
stage
and
disclosed
the
picture
of
the
dead
face
and
the
fleeing
figure
,
brought
out
in
pale
definiteness
by
the
position
of
the
wax
-
lights
.
<EOS>
Everyone
was
startled
,
but
all
eyes
in
the
act
of
turning
toward
the
open
panel
were
recalled
by
a
piercing
cry
from
Gwendolen
,
who
stood
without
change
of
attitude
,
but
with
a
change
of
expression
that
was
terrifying
in
its
terror
.
<EOS>
She
looked
like
a
statue
into
which
a
soul
of
Fear
had
entered
:
her
pallid
lips
were
parted
;
her
eyes
,
usually
narrowed
under
their
long
lashes
,
were
dilated
and
fixed
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
,
less
surprised
than
alarmed
,
rushed
toward
her
,
and
Rex
,
too
,
could
not
help
going
to
her
side
.
<EOS>
But
the
touch
of
her
mother
's
arm
had
the
effect
of
an
electric
charge
;
Gwendolen
fell
on
her
knees
and
put
her
hands
before
her
face
.
<EOS>
She
was
still
trembling
,
but
mute
,
and
it
seemed
that
she
had
self
-
consciousness
enough
to
aim
at
controlling
her
signs
of
terror
,
for
she
presently
allowed
herself
to
be
raised
from
her
kneeling
posture
and
led
away
,
while
the
company
were
relieving
their
minds
by
explanation
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
magnificent
bit
of
_
plastik
_
that
!
"
said
Klesmer
to
Miss
Arrowpoint
.
<EOS>
And
a
quick
fire
of
undertoned
question
and
answer
went
round
.
  
<EOS>
"
Was
it
part
of
the
play
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
surely
not
.
<EOS>
Miss
Harleth
was
too
much
affected
.
<EOS>
A
sensitive
creature
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
<EOS>
I
was
not
aware
that
there
was
a
painting
behind
that
panel
;
were
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
how
should
I
?
<EOS>
Some
eccentricity
in
one
of
the
Earl
's
family
long
ago
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
very
painful
!
<EOS>
Pray
shut
it
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
the
door
locked
?
<EOS>
It
is
very
mysterious
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
the
spirits
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
there
is
no
medium
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
know
that
?
<EOS>
We
must
conclude
that
there
is
,
when
such
things
happen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
the
door
was
not
locked
;
it
was
probably
the
sudden
vibration
from
the
piano
that
sent
it
open
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
conclusion
came
from
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
who
begged
Miss
Merry
if
possible
to
get
the
key
.
<EOS>
But
this
readiness
to
explain
the
mystery
was
thought
by
Mrs.
Vulcany
unbecoming
in
a
clergyman
,
and
she
observed
in
an
undertone
that
Mr.
Gascoigne
was
always
a
little
too
worldly
for
her
taste
.
<EOS>
However
,
the
key
was
produced
,
and
the
rector
turned
it
in
the
lock
with
an
emphasis
rather
offensively
rationalizing
 
as
who
should
say
,
"
it
will
not
start
open
again
"
 
putting
the
key
in
his
pocket
as
a
security
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
Gwendolen
soon
reappeared
,
showing
her
usual
spirits
,
and
evidently
determined
to
ignore
as
far
as
she
could
the
striking
change
she
had
made
in
the
part
of
Hermione
.
  
<EOS>
But
when
Klesmer
said
to
her
,
"
We
have
to
thank
you
for
devising
a
perfect
climax
<EOS>
:
you
could
not
have
chosen
a
finer
bit
of
_
plastik
_
,
"
there
was
a
flush
of
pleasure
in
her
face
.
<EOS>
She
liked
to
accept
as
a
belief
what
was
really
no
more
than
delicate
feigning
.
<EOS>
He
divined
that
the
betrayal
into
a
passion
of
fear
had
been
mortifying
to
her
,
and
wished
her
to
understand
that
he
took
it
for
good
acting
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
cherished
the
idea
that
now
he
was
struck
with
her
talent
as
well
as
her
beauty
,
and
her
uneasiness
about
his
opinion
was
half
turned
to
complacency
.
  
<EOS>
But
too
many
were
in
the
secret
of
what
had
been
included
in
the
rehearsals
,
and
what
had
not
,
and
no
one
besides
Klesmer
took
the
trouble
to
soothe
Gwendolen
's
imagined
mortification
.
<EOS>
The
general
sentiment
was
that
the
incident
should
be
let
drop
.
  
<EOS>
There
had
really
been
a
medium
concerned
in
the
starting
open
of
the
panel
:
one
who
had
quitted
the
room
in
haste
and
crept
to
bed
in
much
alarm
of
conscience
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
small
Isabel
,
whose
intense
curiosity
,
unsatisfied
by
the
brief
glimpse
she
had
had
of
the
strange
picture
on
the
day
of
arrival
at
Offendene
,
had
kept
her
on
the
watch
for
an
opportunity
of
finding
out
where
Gwendolen
had
put
the
key
,
of
stealing
it
from
the
discovered
drawer
when
the
rest
of
the
family
were
out
,
and
getting
on
a
stool
to
unlock
the
panel
.
<EOS>
While
she
was
indulging
her
thirst
for
knowledge
in
this
way
,
a
noise
which
she
feared
was
an
approaching
footstep
alarmed
her
<EOS>
:
she
closed
the
door
and
attempted
hurriedly
to
lock
it
,
but
failing
and
not
daring
to
linger
,
she
withdrew
the
key
and
trusted
that
the
panel
would
stick
,
as
it
seemed
well
inclined
to
do
.
<EOS>
In
this
confidence
she
had
returned
the
key
to
its
former
place
,
stilling
any
anxiety
by
the
thought
that
if
the
door
were
discovered
to
be
unlocked
nobody
would
know
how
the
unlocking
came
about
.
<EOS>
The
inconvenient
Isabel
,
like
other
offenders
,
did
not
foresee
her
own
impulse
to
confession
,
a
fatality
which
came
upon
her
the
morning
after
the
party
,
when
Gwendolen
said
at
the
breakfast
-
table
,
"
I
know
the
door
was
locked
before
the
housekeeper
gave
me
the
key
,
for
I
tried
it
myself
afterward
.
<EOS>
Some
one
must
have
been
to
my
drawer
and
taken
the
key
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
Isabel
that
Gwendolen
's
awful
eyes
had
rested
on
her
more
than
on
the
other
sisters
,
and
without
any
time
for
resolve
,
she
said
,
with
a
trembling
lip
:
  
"
Please
forgive
me
,
Gwendolen
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
forgiveness
was
sooner
bestowed
than
it
would
have
been
if
Gwendolen
had
not
desired
to
dismiss
from
her
own
and
every
one
else
's
memory
any
case
in
which
she
had
shown
her
susceptibility
to
terror
.
<EOS>
She
wondered
at
herself
in
these
occasional
experiences
,
which
seemed
like
a
brief
remembered
madness
,
an
unexplained
exception
from
her
normal
life
;
and
in
this
instance
she
felt
a
peculiar
vexation
that
her
helpless
fear
had
shown
itself
,
not
,
as
usual
,
in
solitude
,
but
in
well
-
lit
company
.
<EOS>
Her
ideal
was
to
be
daring
in
speech
and
reckless
in
braving
dangers
,
both
moral
and
physical
;
and
though
her
practice
fell
far
behind
her
ideal
,
this
shortcoming
seemed
to
be
due
to
the
pettiness
of
circumstances
,
the
narrow
theatre
which
life
offers
to
a
girl
of
twenty
,
who
can
not
conceive
herself
as
anything
else
than
a
lady
,
or
as
in
any
position
which
would
lack
the
tribute
of
respect
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
permanent
consciousness
of
other
fetters
,
or
of
more
spiritual
restraints
,
having
always
disliked
whatever
was
presented
to
her
under
the
name
of
religion
,
in
the
same
way
that
some
people
dislike
arithmetic
and
accounts
:
it
had
raised
no
other
emotion
in
her
,
no
alarm
,
no
longing
;
so
that
the
question
whether
she
believed
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
any
more
than
it
had
occurred
to
her
to
inquire
into
the
conditions
of
colonial
property
and
banking
,
on
which
,
as
she
had
had
many
opportunities
of
knowing
,
the
family
fortune
was
dependent
.
<EOS>
All
these
facts
about
herself
<EOS>
she
would
have
been
ready
to
admit
,
and
even
,
more
or
less
indirectly
,
to
state
.
<EOS>
What
she
unwillingly
recognized
,
and
would
have
been
glad
for
others
to
be
unaware
of
,
was
that
liability
of
hers
to
fits
of
spiritual
dread
,
though
this
fountain
of
awe
within
her
had
not
found
its
way
into
connection
with
the
religion
taught
her
or
with
any
human
relations
.
<EOS>
She
was
ashamed
and
frightened
,
as
at
what
might
happen
again
,
in
remembering
her
tremor
on
suddenly
feeling
herself
alone
,
when
,
for
example
,
she
was
walking
without
companionship
and
there
came
some
rapid
change
in
the
light
.
<EOS>
Solitude
in
any
wide
scene
impressed
her
with
an
undefined
feeling
of
immeasurable
existence
aloof
from
her
,
in
the
midst
of
which
she
was
helplessly
incapable
of
asserting
herself
.
<EOS>
The
little
astronomy
taught
her
at
school
used
sometimes
to
set
her
imagination
at
work
in
a
way
that
made
her
tremble
:
but
always
when
some
one
joined
her
she
recovered
her
indifference
to
the
vastness
in
which
she
seemed
an
exile
;
she
found
again
her
usual
world
in
which
her
will
was
of
some
avail
,
and
<EOS>
the
religious
nomenclature
belonging
to
this
world
was
no
more
identified
for
her
with
those
uneasy
impressions
of
awe
than
her
uncle
's
surplices
seen
out
of
use
at
the
rectory
.
<EOS>
With
human
ears
and
eyes
about
her
,
she
had
always
hitherto
recovered
her
confidence
,
and
felt
the
possibility
of
winning
empire
.
  
<EOS>
To
her
mamma
and
others
<EOS>
her
fits
of
timidity
or
terror
were
sufficiently
accounted
for
by
her
"
sensitiveness
"
or
the
"
excitability
of
her
nature
"
;
but
these
explanatory
phrases
required
conciliation
with
much
that
seemed
to
be
blank
indifference
or
rare
self
-
mastery
.
<EOS>
Heat
is
a
great
agent
and
a
useful
word
,
but
considered
as
a
means
of
explaining
the
universe
it
requires
an
extensive
knowledge
of
differences
;
and
as
a
means
of
explaining
character
"
sensitiveness
"
is
in
much
the
same
predicament
.
<EOS>
But
who
,
loving
a
creature
like
Gwendolen
,
would
not
be
inclined
to
regard
every
peculiarity
in
her
as
a
mark
of
preeminence
?
<EOS>
That
was
what
Rex
did
.
<EOS>
After
the
Hermione
scene
he
was
more
persuaded
than
ever
that
she
must
be
instinct
with
all
feeling
,
and
not
only
readier
to
respond
to
a
worshipful
love
,
but
able
to
love
better
than
other
girls
.

felt

Anna
was
in
the
secret
of
Rex
's
feeling
;
though
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
he
had
said
nothing
to
her
about
what
he
most
thought
of
,
and
he
only
took
it
for
granted
that
she
knew
it
.

For
the
first
time
,
too
,
Anna
could
not
say
to
Rex
what
was
continually
in
her
mind
.

Perhaps
it
might
have
been
a
pain
which
she
would
have
had
to
conceal
,
that
he
should
so
soon
care
for
some

else
more

always
very
good
to
me
,
"
and
held
it
in
the
order
of
things
for
herself
to
be
entirely
subject
to
this
cousin
;
but
she
looked
at
her
with
mingled
fear
and
distrust
,
with
a
puzzled
contemplation
as
of
some
wondrous
and
beautiful
animal
whose
nature
was
a
mystery
,
and
who
,
for
anything
Anna
knew
,
might
have
an
appetite
for
devouring
all
the
small
creatures
that
were
her
own
particular
pets
.
<EOS>
And
now
Anna
's
heart
was
sinking
under
the
heavy
conviction
which
she
dared
not
utter
,
that
Gwendolen
would
never
care
for
Rex
.
<EOS>
What
she
herself
held
in
tenderness
and
reverence
had
constantly
seemed
indifferent
to
Gwendolen
,
and
it
was
easier
to
imagine
her
scorning
Rex
than
returning
any
tenderness
of
his
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
she
was
always
thinking
of
being
something
extraordinary
.
<EOS>
And
poor
Rex
!
Papa
would
be
angry
with
him
if
he
knew
.
<EOS>
And
of
course
he
was
too
young
to
be
in
love
in
that
way
;
and
she
,
Anna
had
thought
that
it
would
be
years
and
years
before
any
thing
of
that
sort
came
,
and
that
she
would
be
Rex
's
housekeeper
ever
so
long
.
<EOS>
But
what
a
heart
must
that
be
which
did
not
return
his
love
!
<EOS>
Anna
,
in
the
prospect
of
his
suffering
,
was
beginning
to
dislike
her
too
fascinating
cousin
.
  
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
her
,
as
it
did
to
Rex
,
that
the
weeks
had
been
filled
with
a
tumultuous
life
evident
to
all
observers
:
if
he
had
been
questioned
on
the
subject
he
would
have
said
that
he
had
no
wish
to
conceal
what
he
hoped
would
be
an
engagement
which
he
should
immediately
tell
his
father
of
:
and
yet
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
was
reserved
not
only
about
his
feelings
but
 
which
was
more
remarkable
to
Anna
 
about
certain
actions
.
<EOS>
She
,
on
her
side
,
was
nervous
each
time
her
father
or
mother
began
to
speak
to
her
in
private
lest
they
should
say
anything
about
Rex
and
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
But
the
elders
were
not
in
the
least
alive
to
this
agitating
drama
,
which
went
forward
chiefly
in
a
sort
of
pantomime
extremely
lucid
in
the
minds
thus
expressing
themselves
,
but
easily
missed
by
spectators
who
were
running
their
eyes
over
the
_
Guardian
_
or
the
_
Clerical
Gazette
_
,
and
regarded
the
trivialities
of
the
young
ones
with
scarcely
more
interpretation
than
they
gave
to
the
action
of
lively
ants
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
are
you
going
,
Rex
?
"
said
Anna
one
gray
morning
when
her
father
had
set
off
in
his
carriage
to
the
sessions
,
Mrs.
Gascoigne
with
him
,
and
<EOS>
she
had
observed
that
her
brother
had
on
his
antigropelos
,
the
utmost
approach
he
possessed
to
a
hunting
equipment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Going
to
see
the
hounds
throw
off
at
the
Three
Barns
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Are
you
going
to
take
Gwendolen
?
"
said
Anna
,
timidly
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
told
you
,
did
she
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
<EOS>
but
I
thought
 
<EOS>
Does
papa
know
you
are
going
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
that
I
am
aware
of
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
suppose
he
would
trouble
himself
about
the
matter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
going
to
use
his
horse
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
knows
I
do
that
whenever
I
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
let
Gwendolen
ride
after
the
hounds
,
Rex
,
"
said
Anna
,
whose
fears
gifted
her
with
second
-
sight
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
said
Rex
,
smiling
rather
provokingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
and
mamma
and
aunt
Davilow
all
wish
her
not
to
.
<EOS>
They
think
it
is
not
right
for
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
you
suppose
she
is
going
to
do
what
is
not
right
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Gwendolen
minds
nobody
sometimes
,
"
said
Anna
getting
bolder
by
dint
of
a
little
anger
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
she
would
not
mind
me
,
"
said
Rex
,
perversely
making
a
joke
of
poor
Anna
's
anxiety
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
Rex
,
I
can
not
bear
it
.
<EOS>
You
will
make
yourself
very
unhappy
.
"
<EOS>
Here
Anna
burst
into
tears
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nannie
,
Nannie
,
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
with
you
?
"
said
Rex
,
a
little
impatient
at
being
kept
in
this
way
,
hat
on
and
whip
in
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
will
not
care
for
you
one
bit
 
<EOS>
I
know
she
never
will
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
poor
child
in
a
sobbing
whisper
.
<EOS>
She
had
lost
all
control
of
herself
.
  
<EOS>
Rex
reddened
and
hurried
away
from
her
out
of
the
hall
door
,
leaving
her
to
the
miserable
consciousness
of
having
made
herself
disagreeable
in
vain
.
  
<EOS>
He
did
think
of
her
words
as
he
rode
along
;
they
had
the
unwelcomeness
which
all
unfavorable
fortune
-
telling
has
,
even
when
laughed
at
;
but
he
quickly
explained
them
as
springing
from
little
Anna
's
tenderness
,
and
began
to
be
sorry
that
he
was
obliged
to
come
away
without
soothing
her
.
<EOS>
Every
other
feeling
on
the
subject
,
however
,
was
quickly
merged
in
a
resistant
belief
to
the
contrary
of
hers
,
accompanied
with
a
new
determination
to
prove
that
he
was
right
.
<EOS>
This
sort
of
certainty
had
just
enough
kinship
to
doubt
and
uneasiness
to
hurry
on
a
confession
which
an
untouched
security
might
have
delayed
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
was
already
mounted
and
riding
up
and
down
the
avenue
when
Rex
appeared
at
the
gate
.
<EOS>
She
had
provided
herself
against
disappointment
in
case
he
did
not
appear
in
time
by
having
the
groom
ready
behind
her
,
for
she
would
not
have
waited
beyond
a
reasonable
time
.
<EOS>
But
now
the
groom
was
dismissed
,
and
the
two
rode
away
in
delightful
freedom
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
was
in
her
highest
spirits
,
and
Rex
thought
that
she
had
never
looked
so
lovely
before
;
her
figure
,
her
long
white
throat
,
and
the
curves
of
her
cheek
and
chin
were
always
set
off
to
perfection
by
the
compact
simplicity
of
her
riding
dress
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
conceive
a
more
perfect
girl
;
and
to
a
youthful
lover
like
Rex
<EOS>
it
seems
that
the
fundamental
identity
of
the
good
,
the
true
and
the
beautiful
,
is
already
extant
and
manifest
in
the
object
of
his
love
.
<EOS>
Most
observers
would
have
held
it
more
than
equally
accountable
that
a
girl
should
have
like
impressions
about
Rex
,
for
in
his
handsome
face
there
was
nothing
corresponding
to
the
undefinable
stinging
quality
 
as
it
were
a
trace
of
demon
ancestry
 
which
made
some
beholders
hesitate
in
their
admiration
of
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
an
exquisite
January
morning
in
which
there
was
no
threat
of
rain
,
but
a
gray
sky
making
the
calmest
background
for
the
charms
of
a
mild
winter
scene
 
<EOS>
the
grassy
borders
of
the
lanes
<EOS>
,
the
hedgerows
sprinkled
with
red
berries
and
haunted
with
low
twitterings
,
the
purple
bareness
of
the
elms
,
the
rich
brown
of
the
furrows
.
<EOS>
The
horses
'
hoofs
made
a
musical
chime
,
accompanying
their
young
voices
.
<EOS>
She
was
laughing
at
his
equipment
,
for
he
was
the
reverse
of
a
dandy
,
and
he
was
enjoying
her
laughter
;
the
freshness
of
the
morning
mingled
with
the
freshness
of
their
youth
;
and
every
sound
that
came
from
their
clear
throats
,
every
glance
they
gave
each
other
,
was
the
bubbling
outflow
from
a
spring
of
joy
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
morning
to
them
,
within
and
without
.
<EOS>
And
thinking
of
them
in
these
moments
one
is
tempted
to
that
futile
sort
of
wishing
 
<EOS>
if
only
things
could
have
been
a
little
otherwise
then
,
so
as
to
have
been
greatly
otherwise
after
 
if
only
these
two
beautiful
young
creatures
could
have
pledged
themselves
to
each
other
then
and
there
,
and
never
through
life
have
swerved
from
that
pledge
!
<EOS>
For
some
of
the
goodness
which
Rex
believed
in
was
there
.
<EOS>
Goodness
is
a
large
,
often
a
prospective
word
;
like
harvest
,
which
at
one
stage
when
we
talk
of
it
lies
all
underground
,
with
an
indeterminate
future
;
is
the
germ
prospering
in
the
darkness
?
<EOS>
at
another
,
it
has
put
forth
delicate
green
blades
,
and
by
-
and
-
by
<EOS>
the
trembling
blossoms
are
ready
to
be
dashed
off
by
an
hour
of
rough
wind
or
rain
.
<EOS>
Each
stage
has
its
peculiar
blight
,
and
may
have
the
healthy
life
choked
out
of
it
by
a
particular
action
of
the
foul
land
which
rears
or
neighbors
it
,
or
by
damage
brought
from
foulness
afar
.
  
<EOS>
"
Anna
had
got
it
into
her
head
that
you
would
want
to
ride
after
the
hounds
this
morning
,
"
said
Rex
,
whose
secret
associations
with
Anna
's
words
made
this
speech
seem
quite
perilously
near
the
most
momentous
of
subjects
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
she
?
"
said
Gwendolen
,
laughingly
.
<EOS>
"
What
a
little
clairvoyant
she
is
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
you
?
"
said
Rex
,
who
had
not
believed
in
her
intending
to
do
it
if
the
elders
objected
,
but
confided
in
her
having
good
reasons
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
tell
what
I
shall
do
till
I
get
there
.
<EOS>
Clairvoyants
are
often
wrong
:
they
foresee
what
is
likely
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
fond
of
what
is
likely
:
it
is
always
dull
.
<EOS>
I
do
what
is
unlikely
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
there
you
tell
me
a
secret
.
<EOS>
When
once
I
knew
what
people
in
general
would
be
likely
to
do
,
I
should
know
you
would
do
the
opposite
.
<EOS>
So
you
would
have
come
round
to
a
likelihood
of
your
own
sort
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
able
to
calculate
on
you
.
<EOS>
You
could
n't
surprise
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
could
.
<EOS>
I
should
turn
round
and
do
what
was
likely
for
people
in
general
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
with
a
musical
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
you
ca
n't
escape
some
sort
of
likelihood
.
<EOS>
And
contradictoriness
makes
the
strongest
likelihood
of
all
.
<EOS>
You
must
give
up
a
plan
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
shall
not
.
<EOS>
My
plan
is
to
do
what
pleases
me
.
"
<EOS>
(
Here
should
any
young
lady
incline
to
imitate
Gwendolen
<EOS>
,
let
her
consider
the
set
of
her
head
and
neck
:
if
the
angle
there
had
been
different
,
the
chin
protrusive
,
and
the
cervical
vertebrae
a
trifle
more
curved
in
their
position
,
ten
to
one
Gwendolen
's
words
would
have
had
a
jar
in
them
for
the
sweet
-
natured
Rex
.
<EOS>
But
everything
odd
in
her
speech
was
humor
and
pretty
banter
,
which
he
was
only
anxious
to
turn
toward
one
point
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
manage
to
feel
only
what
pleases
you
?
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
not
;
that
comes
from
what
other
people
do
.
<EOS>
But
if
the
world
were
pleasanter
,
one
would
only
feel
what
was
pleasant
.
<EOS>
Girls
'
lives
are
so
stupid
:
they
never
do
what
they
like
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
that
was
more
the
case
of
the
men
.
<EOS>
They
are
forced
to
do
hard
things
,
and
are
often
dreadfully
bored
,
and
knocked
to
pieces
too
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
if
we
love
a
girl
very
dearly
we
want
to
do
as
she
likes
,
so
after
all
you
have
your
own
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
it
.
<EOS>
I
never
saw
a
married
woman
who
had
her
own
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
should
you
like
to
do
?
"
said
Rex
,
quite
guilelessly
,
and
in
real
anxiety
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
!
 
<EOS>
go
to
the
North
Pole
,
or
ride
steeple
-
chases
,
or
go
to
be
a
queen
in
the
East
like
Lady
Hester
Stanhope
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
flightily
.
<EOS>
Her
words
were
born
on
her
lips
,
but
she
would
have
been
at
a
loss
to
give
an
answer
of
deeper
origin
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
you
would
never
be
married
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
did
n't
say
that
.
<EOS>
Only
when
I
married
,
I
should
not
do
as
other
women
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
might
do
just
as
you
liked
if
you
married
a
man
who
loved
you
more
dearly
than
anything
else
in
the
world
,
"
said
Rex
,
who
,
poor
youth
,
was
moving
in
themes
outside
the
curriculum
in
which
he
had
promised
to
win
distinction
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
one
who
does
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
talk
of
Mr.
Middleton
,
for
heaven
's
sake
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
hastily
,
a
quick
blush
spreading
over
her
face
and
neck
;
"
that
is
Anna
's
chant
.
<EOS>
I
hear
the
hounds
.
<EOS>
Let
us
go
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
put
her
chestnut
to
a
canter
,
and
Rex
had
no
choice
but
to
follow
her
.
<EOS>
Still
he
felt
encouraged
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
was
perfectly
aware
that
her
cousin
was
in
love
with
her
;
but
she
had
no
idea
that
the
matter
was
of
any
consequence
,
having
never
had
the
slightest
visitation
of
painful
love
herself
.
<EOS>
She
wished
the
small
romance
of
Rex
's
devotion
to
fill
up
the
time
of
his
stay
at
Pennicote
,
and
to
avoid
explanations
which
would
bring
it
to
an
untimely
end
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
she
objected
,
with
a
sort
of
physical
repulsion
,
to
being
directly
made
love
to
.
<EOS>
With
all
her
imaginative
delight
in
being
adored
,
there
was
a
certain
fierceness
of
maidenhood
in
her
.
  
<EOS>
But
all
other
thoughts
were
soon
lost
for
her
in
the
excitement
of
the
scene
at
the
Three
Barns
.
<EOS>
Several
gentlemen
of
the
hunt
knew
her
,
and
she
exchanged
pleasant
greetings
.
<EOS>
Rex
could
not
get
another
word
with
her
.
<EOS>
The
color
,
the
stir
of
the
field
had
taken
possession
of
Gwendolen
with
a
strength
which
was
not
due
to
habitual
associations
,
for
she
had
never
yet
ridden
after
the
hounds
 
<EOS>
only
said
she
should
like
to
do
it
,
and
so
drawn
forth
a
prohibition
;
<EOS>
her
mamma
dreading
the
danger
,
and
her
uncle
declaring
that
for
his
part
he
held
that
kind
of
violent
exercise
unseemly
in
a
woman
,
and
that
whatever
might
be
done
in
other
parts
of
the
country
,
no
lady
of
good
position
followed
the
Wessex
hunt
:
<EOS>
no
one
but
Mrs.
Gadsby
,
the
yeomanry
captain
's
wife
,
who
had
been
a
kitchenmaid
and
still
spoke
like
one
.
<EOS>
This
last
argument
had
some
effect
on
Gwendolen
,
and
had
kept
her
halting
between
her
desire
to
assert
her
freedom
and
her
horror
of
being
classed
with
Mrs.
Gadsby
.
  
<EOS>
Some
of
the
most
unexceptionable
women
in
the
neighborhood
occasionally
went
to
see
the
hounds
throw
off
;
but
it
happened
that
none
of
them
were
present
this
morning
to
abstain
from
following
,
while
Mrs.
Gadsby
,
with
her
doubtful
antecedents
,
grammatical
and
otherwise
,
was
not
visible
to
make
following
seem
unbecoming
.
<EOS>
Thus
Gwendolen
felt
no
check
on
the
animal
stimulus
that
came
from
the
stir
and
tongue
of
the
hounds
,
the
pawing
of
the
horses
,
the
varying
voices
of
men
,
the
movement
hither
and
thither
of
vivid
color
on
the
background
of
green
and
gray
stillness
:
 
that
utmost
excitement
of
the
coming
chase
which
consists
in
feeling
something
like
a
combination
of
dog
and
horse
,
with
the
superadded
thrill
of
social
vanities
and
consciousness
of
centaur
-
power
which
belongs
to
humankind
.
  
<EOS>
Rex
would
have
felt
more
of
the
same
enjoyment
if
he
could
have
kept
nearer
to
Gwendolen
,
and
not
seen
her
constantly
occupied
with
acquaintances
,
or
looked
at
by
would
-
be
acquaintances
,
all
on
lively
horses
which
veered
about
and
swept
the
surrounding
space
as
effectually
as
a
revolving
lever
.
  
<EOS>
"
Glad
to
see
you
here
this
fine
morning
,
Miss
Harleth
,
"
said
Lord
Brackenshaw
,
a
middle
-
aged
peer
of
aristocratic
seediness
in
stained
pink
,
with
easy
-
going
manners
which
would
have
made
the
threatened
deluge
seem
of
no
consequence
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
have
a
first
-
rate
run
.
<EOS>
A
pity
you
did
n't
go
with
us
.
<EOS>
Have
you
ever
tried
your
little
chestnut
at
a
ditch
?
<EOS>
you
would
n't
be
afraid
,
eh
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
the
least
in
the
world
,
"
said
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
And
that
was
true
:
she
was
never
fearful
in
action
and
companionship
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
often
taken
him
at
some
rails
and
a
ditch
too
,
near
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
by
Jove
!
"
said
his
lordship
,
quietly
,
in
notation
that
something
was
happening
which
must
break
off
the
dialogue
:
and
as
he
reined
off
his
horse
,
Rex
was
bringing
his
sober
hackney
up
to
Gwendolen
's
side
when
 
the
hounds
gave
tongue
,
and
the
whole
field
was
in
motion
as
if
the
whirl
of
the
earth
were
carrying
it
;
Gwendolen
along
with
everything
else
;
no
word
of
notice
to
Rex
,
who
without
a
second
thought
followed
too
.
<EOS>
Could
he
let
Gwendolen
go
alone
?
<EOS>
under
other
circumstances
he
would
have
enjoyed
the
run
,
but
he
was
just
now
perturbed
by
the
check
which
had
been
put
on
the
impetus
to
utter
his
love
,
and
get
utterance
in
return
,
an
impetus
which
could
not
at
once
resolve
itself
into
a
totally
different
sort
of
chase
,
at
least
with
the
consciousness
of
being
on
his
father
's
gray
nag
,
a
good
horse
enough
in
his
way
,
but
of
sober
years
and
ecclesiastical
habits
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
on
her
spirited
little
chestnut
was
up
with
the
best
,
and
felt
as
secure
as
an
immortal
goddess
,
having
,
if
she
had
thought
of
risk
,
a
core
of
confidence
that
no
ill
luck
would
happen
to
her
.
<EOS>
But
she
thought
of
no
such
thing
,
and
certainly
not
of
any
risk
there
might
be
for
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
If
she
had
thought
of
him
,
it
would
have
struck
her
as
a
droll
picture
that
he
should
be
gradually
falling
behind
,
and
looking
round
in
search
of
gates
:
<EOS>
a
fine
lithe
youth
,
whose
heart
must
be
panting
with
all
the
spirit
of
a
beagle
,
stuck
as
if
under
a
wizard
's
spell
on
a
stiff
clerical
hackney
,
would
have
made
her
laugh
with
a
sense
of
fun
much
too
strong
for
her
to
reflect
on
his
mortification
.
<EOS>
But
Gwendolen
was
apt
to
think
rather
of
those
who
saw
her
than
of
those
whom
she
could
not
see
;
and
Rex
was
soon
so
far
behind
that
if
she
had
looked
she
would
not
have
seen
him
.
<EOS>
For
I
grieve
to
say
that
in
the
search
for
a
gate
,
along
a
lane
lately
mended
,
Primrose
fell
,
broke
his
knees
,
and
undesignedly
threw
Rex
over
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
Fortunately
a
blacksmith
's
son
who
also
followed
the
hounds
under
disadvantages
,
namely
,
on
foot
(
a
loose
way
of
hunting
which
had
struck
some
even
frivolous
minds
as
immoral
)
,
was
naturally
also
in
the
rear
,
and
happened
to
be
within
sight
of
Rex
's
misfortune
.
<EOS>
He
ran
to
give
help
which
was
greatly
needed
,
for
Rex
was
a
great
deal
stunned
,
and
the
complete
recovery
of
sensation
came
in
the
form
of
pain
.
<EOS>
Joel
Dagge
on
this
occasion
showed
himself
that
most
useful
of
personages
,
whose
knowledge
is
of
a
kind
suited
to
the
immediate
occasion
:
he
not
only
knew
perfectly
well
<EOS>
what
was
the
matter
with
the
horse
,
how
far
they
were
both
from
the
nearest
public
-
house
and
from
Pennicote
Rectory
,
and
could
certify
to
Rex
that
his
shoulder
was
only
a
bit
out
of
joint
,
but
also
offered
experienced
surgical
aid
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lord
,
sir
,
let
me
shove
it
in
again
for
you
!
<EOS>
I
's
seen
<EOS>
Nash
,
the
bone
-
setter
,
do
it
,
and
done
it
myself
for
our
little
Sally
twice
over
.
<EOS>
It
's
all
one
and
the
same
,
shoulders
is
.
<EOS>
If
you
'll
trusten
to
me
and
tighten
your
mind
up
a
bit
,
I
'll
do
it
for
you
in
no
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Come
then
,
old
fellow
,
"
said
Rex
,
who
could
tighten
his
mind
better
than
his
seat
in
the
saddle
.
<EOS>
And
Joel
managed
the
operation
,
though
not
without
considerable
expense
of
pain
to
his
patient
,
who
turned
so
pitiably
pale
while
tightening
his
mind
,
that
Joel
remarked
,
"
Ah
,
sir
,
you
are
n't
used
to
it
,
that
's
how
it
is
.
<EOS>
I
's
see
lots
and
lots
o
'
joints
out
.
<EOS>
I
see
a
man
with
his
eye
pushed
out
once
 
that
was
a
rum
go
as
ever
<EOS>
I
see
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
have
a
bit
o
<EOS>
'
fun
wi'out
<EOS>
such
sort
<EOS>
o
'
things
.
<EOS>
But
it
went
in
again
.
<EOS>
I
's
swallowed
three
teeth
mysen
,
as
sure
as
I
'm
alive
.
<EOS>
Now
,
sirrey
"
<EOS>
(
this
was
addressed
to
Primrose
)
,
"
come
alonk
 
<EOS>
you
musn't
<EOS>
make
believe
as
you
ca
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Joel
being
clearly
a
low
character
,
it
is
,
happily
,
not
necessary
to
say
more
of
him
to
the
refined
reader
,
than
that
he
helped
Rex
to
get
home
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
alternative
but
to
get
home
,
though
all
the
while
he
was
in
anxiety
about
Gwendolen
,
and
more
miserable
in
the
thought
that
she
,
too
,
might
have
had
an
accident
,
than
in
the
pain
of
his
own
bruises
and
the
annoyance
he
was
about
to
cause
his
father
.
<EOS>
He
comforted
himself
about
her
by
reflecting
that
every
one
would
be
anxious
to
take
care
of
her
,
and
that
some
acquaintance
would
be
sure
to
conduct
her
home
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
was
already
at
home
,
and
was
writing
letters
in
his
study
,
when
he
was
interrupted
by
seeing
poor
Rex
come
in
with
a
face
which
was
not
the
less
handsome
and
ingratiating
for
being
pale
and
a
little
distressed
.
<EOS>
He
was
secretly
the
favorite
son
,
and
a
young
portrait
of
the
father
;
who
,
however
,
never
treated
him
with
any
partiality
 
rather
,
with
an
extra
rigor
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
having
inquired
of
Anna
,
knew
that
Rex
had
gone
with
Gwendolen
to
the
meet
at
the
Three
Barns
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
hastily
,
not
laying
down
his
pen
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
very
sorry
,
sir
;
Primrose
has
fallen
down
and
broken
his
knees
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
have
you
been
with
him
?
"
said
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
with
a
touch
of
severity
.
<EOS>
He
rarely
gave
way
to
temper
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
the
Three
Barns
to
see
the
hounds
throw
off
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
were
fool
enough
to
follow
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
go
at
any
fences
,
but
the
horse
got
his
leg
into
a
hole
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
got
hurt
yourself
,
I
hope
,
eh
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
got
my
shoulder
put
out
,
but
a
young
blacksmith
put
it
in
again
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
'm
just
a
little
battered
,
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sit
down
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
very
sorry
about
the
horse
,
sir
;
I
knew
it
would
be
a
vexation
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
has
become
of
Gwendolen
?
"
said
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
abruptly
.
<EOS>
Rex
,
who
did
not
imagine
that
his
father
had
made
any
inquiries
about
him
,
answered
at
first
with
a
blush
,
which
was
the
more
remarkable
for
his
previous
paleness
.
<EOS>
Then
he
said
,
nervously
    
"
I
am
anxious
to
know
 
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
go
or
send
at
once
to
Offendene
 
<EOS>
but
she
rides
so
well
,
<EOS>
and
I
think
she
would
keep
up
 
<EOS>
there
would
most
likely
be
many
round
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
was
she
who
led
you
on
,
eh
?
"
said
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
laying
down
his
pen
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
,
and
looking
at
Rex
with
more
marked
examination
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
natural
for
her
to
want
to
go
:
she
did
n't
intend
it
beforehand
 
<EOS>
she
was
led
away
by
the
spirit
of
the
thing
.
<EOS>
And
,
of
course
,
I
went
when
she
went
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
left
a
brief
interval
of
silence
,
and
then
said
,
with
quiet
irony
,
 
"
But
now
you
observe
,
young
gentleman
,
that
you
are
not
furnished
with
a
horse
which
will
enable
you
to
play
the
squire
to
your
cousin
.
<EOS>
You
must
give
up
that
amusement
.
<EOS>
You
have
spoiled
my
nag
for
me
,
and
that
is
enough
mischief
for
one
vacation
.
<EOS>
I
shall
beg
you
to
get
ready
to
start
for
Southampton
to
-
morrow
and
join
Stilfox
,
till
you
go
up
to
Oxford
with
him
.
<EOS>
That
will
be
good
for
your
bruises
as
well
as
your
studies
.
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Rex
felt
his
heart
swelling
and
comporting
itself
as
if
it
had
been
no
better
than
a
girl
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
will
not
insist
on
my
going
immediately
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
feel
too
ill
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
that
 
but
 
"
here
Rex
bit
his
lips
and
felt
the
tears
starting
,
to
his
great
vexation
;
then
he
rallied
and
tried
to
say
more
firmly
,
"
I
want
to
go
to
Offendene
,
but
I
can
go
this
evening
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
there
myself
.
<EOS>
I
can
bring
word
about
Gwendolen
,
if
that
is
what
you
want
.
"
  
<EOS>
Rex
broke
down
.
<EOS>
He
thought
he
discerned
an
intention
fatal
to
his
happiness
,
nay
,
his
life
.
<EOS>
He
was
accustomed
to
believe
in
his
father
's
penetration
,
and
to
expect
firmness
.
"
<EOS>
Father
,
I
ca
n't
go
away
without
telling
her
that
I
love
her
,
and
knowing
that
she
loves
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
was
inwardly
going
through
some
self
-
rebuke
for
not
being
more
wary
,
and
was
now
really
sorry
for
the
lad
;
but
every
consideration
was
subordinate
to
that
of
using
the
wisest
tactics
in
the
case
.
<EOS>
He
had
quickly
made
up
his
mind
and
to
answer
the
more
quietly
    
<EOS>
"
My
dear
boy
,
you
are
too
young
to
be
taking
momentous
,
decisive
steps
of
that
sort
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
fancy
which
you
have
got
into
your
head
during
an
idle
week
or
two
:
you
must
set
to
work
at
something
and
dismiss
it
.
<EOS>
There
is
every
reason
against
it
.
<EOS>
An
engagement
at
your
age
would
be
totally
rash
and
unjustifiable
;
and
moreover
,
alliances
between
first
cousins
are
undesirable
.
<EOS>
Make
up
your
mind
to
a
brief
disappointment
.
<EOS>
Life
is
full
of
them
.
<EOS>
We
have
all
got
to
be
broken
in
;
and
this
is
a
mild
beginning
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
mild
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
bear
it
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
good
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
should
n't
mind
anything
,
if
it
were
settled
between
us
.
<EOS>
I
could
do
anything
then
,
"
said
Rex
,
impetuously
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
's
of
no
use
to
pretend
that
I
will
obey
you
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
do
it
.
<EOS>
If
I
said
I
would
,
I
should
be
sure
to
break
my
word
.
<EOS>
I
should
see
Gwendolen
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
wait
till
to
-
morrow
morning
,
that
we
may
talk
of
the
matter
again
 
<EOS>
you
will
promise
me
that
,
"
said
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
quietly
;
and
Rex
did
not
,
could
not
refuse
.
  
<EOS>
The
rector
did
not
even
tell
his
wife
that
he
had
any
other
reason
for
going
to
Offendene
that
evening
than
his
desire
to
ascertain
that
Gwendolen
had
got
home
safely
.
<EOS>
He
found
her
more
than
safe
 
elated
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Quallon
,
who
had
won
the
brush
,
had
delivered
the
trophy
to
her
,
and
she
had
brought
it
before
her
,
fastened
on
the
saddle
;
more
than
that
,
Lord
Brackenshaw
had
conducted
her
home
,
and
had
shown
himself
delighted
with
her
spirited
riding
.
<EOS>
All
this
was
told
at
once
to
her
uncle
,
that
he
might
see
how
well
justified
she
had
been
in
acting
against
his
advice
;
and
the
prudential
rector
did
feel
himself
in
a
slight
difficulty
,
for
at
that
moment
he
was
particularly
sensible
that
it
was
his
niece
's
serious
interest
to
be
well
regarded
by
the
Brackenshaws
,
and
their
opinion
as
to
her
following
the
hounds
really
touched
the
essence
of
his
objection
.
<EOS>
However
,
he
was
not
obliged
to
say
anything
immediately
,
for
Mrs.
Davilow
followed
up
Gwendolen
's
brief
triumphant
phrases
with
    
<EOS>
"
Still
,
I
do
hope
you
will
not
do
it
again
,
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
I
should
never
have
a
moment
's
quiet
.
<EOS>
Her
father
died
by
an
accident
,
you
know
.
"
  
<EOS>
Here
Mrs.
Davilow
had
turned
away
from
Gwendolen
,
and
looked
at
Mr.
Gascoigne
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mamma
,
dear
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
kissing
her
merrily
,
and
passing
over
the
question
of
the
fears
which
Mrs.
Davilow
had
meant
to
account
for
,
"
children
do
n't
take
after
their
parents
in
broken
legs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Not
one
word
had
yet
been
said
about
Rex
.
<EOS>
In
fact
there
had
been
no
anxiety
about
him
at
Offendene
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
had
observed
to
her
mamma
,
"
Oh
,
he
must
have
been
left
far
behind
,
and
gone
home
in
despair
,
"
and
it
could
not
be
denied
that
this
was
fortunate
so
far
as
it
made
way
for
Lord
Brackenshaw
's
bringing
her
home
.
<EOS>
But
now
Mr.
Gascoigne
said
,
with
some
emphasis
,
looking
at
Gwendolen
    
<EOS>
"
Well
,
the
exploit
has
ended
better
for
you
than
for
Rex
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
dare
say
he
had
to
make
a
terrible
round
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
taught
Primrose
to
take
the
fences
,
uncle
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
without
the
faintest
shade
of
alarm
in
her
looks
and
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Rex
has
had
a
fall
,
"
said
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
curtly
,
throwing
himself
into
an
arm
-
chair
resting
his
elbows
and
fitting
his
palms
and
fingers
together
,
while
he
closed
his
lips
and
looked
at
Gwendolen
,
who
said
    
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
he
is
not
hurt
,
I
hope
?
"
<EOS>
with
a
correct
look
of
anxiety
such
as
elated
mortals
try
to
super
-
induce
when
their
pulses
are
all
the
while
quick
with
triumph
;
and
Mrs.
Davilow
,
in
the
same
moment
,
uttered
a
low
"
Good
heavens
!
<EOS>
There
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
went
on
:
"
He
put
his
shoulder
out
,
and
got
some
bruises
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
Here
he
made
another
little
pause
of
observation
;
but
Gwendolen
,
instead
of
any
such
symptoms
as
pallor
and
silence
,
had
only
deepened
the
compassionateness
of
her
brow
and
eyes
,
and
said
again
,
"
Oh
,
poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
it
is
nothing
serious
,
then
?
"
and
Mr.
Gascoigne
held
his
diagnosis
complete
.
<EOS>
But
he
wished
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
,
and
went
on
still
with
a
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
got
his
arm
set
again
rather
oddly
.
<EOS>
Some
blacksmith
 
<EOS>
not
a
parishioner
of
mine
 
was
on
the
field
 
<EOS>
a
loose
fish
,
I
suppose
,
but
handy
,
and
set
the
arm
for
him
immediately
.
<EOS>
So
after
all
,
I
believe
,
I
and
Primrose
come
off
worst
.
<EOS>
The
horse
's
knees
are
cut
to
pieces
.
<EOS>
He
came
down
in
a
hole
,
it
seems
,
and
pitched
Rex
over
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
face
had
allowably
become
contented
again
,
since
Rex
's
arm
had
been
reset
;
and
now
,
at
the
descriptive
suggestions
in
the
latter
part
of
her
uncle
's
speech
,
her
elated
spirits
made
her
features
less
unmanageable
than
usual
;
the
smiles
broke
forth
,
and
finally
a
descending
scale
of
laughter
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
pretty
young
lady
 
to
laugh
at
other
people
's
calamities
,
"
said
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
with
a
milder
sense
of
disapprobation
than
if
he
had
not
had
counteracting
reasons
to
be
glad
that
Gwendolen
showed
no
deep
feeling
on
the
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
forgive
me
,
uncle
.
<EOS>
Now
Rex
is
safe
,
it
is
so
droll
to
fancy
the
figure
he
and
Primrose
would
cut
 
in
a
lane
all
by
themselves
 
only
a
blacksmith
running
up
.
<EOS>
It
would
make
a
capital
caricature
of
"
Following
the
Hounds
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
Gwendolen
rather
valued
herself
on
her
superior
freedom
in
laughing
where
others
might
only
see
matter
for
seriousness
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
laughter
became
her
person
so
well
that
her
opinion
of
its
gracefulness
was
often
shared
by
others
;
and
it
even
entered
into
her
uncle
's
course
of
thought
at
this
moment
,
that
it
was
no
wonder
a
boy
should
be
fascinated
by
this
young
witch
 
who
,
however
,
was
more
mischievous
than
could
be
desired
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
laugh
at
broken
bones
,
child
?
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
still
under
her
dominant
anxiety
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
we
had
never
allowed
you
to
have
the
horse
.
<EOS>
You
will
see
that
we
were
wrong
,
"
she
added
,
looking
with
a
grave
nod
at
Mr.
Gascoigne
 
"
at
least
I
was
,
to
encourage
her
in
asking
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
seriously
,
Gwendolen
,
"
said
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
in
a
judicious
tone
of
rational
advice
to
a
person
understood
to
be
altogether
rational
,
"
I
strongly
recommend
you
 
<EOS>
I
shall
ask
you
to
oblige
me
so
far
 
not
to
repeat
your
adventure
of
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Lord
Brackenshaw
is
very
kind
,
but
I
feel
sure
that
he
would
concur
with
me
in
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
To
be
spoken
of
as
'
the
young
lady
who
hunts
'
by
way
of
exception
,
would
give
a
tone
to
the
language
about
you
which
I
am
sure
you
would
not
like
.
<EOS>
Depend
upon
it
,
his
lordship
would
not
choose
that
Lady
Beatrice
or
Lady
Maria
should
hunt
in
this
part
of
the
country
,
if
they
were
old
enough
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
When
you
are
married
,
it
will
be
different
:
you
may
do
whatever
your
husband
sanctions
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
intend
to
hunt
,
you
must
marry
a
man
who
can
keep
horses
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
why
I
should
do
anything
so
horrible
as
to
marry
without
_
that
_
prospect
,
at
least
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
pettishly
.
<EOS>
Her
uncle
's
speech
had
given
her
annoyance
,
which
she
could
not
show
more
directly
;
but
she
felt
that
she
was
committing
herself
,
and
after
moving
carelessly
to
another
part
of
the
room
,
went
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
always
speaks
in
that
way
about
marriage
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
;
"
but
it
will
be
different
when
she
has
seen
the
right
person
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Her
heart
has
never
been
in
the
least
<EOS>
touched
,
that
you
know
of
?
"
said
Mr.
Gascoigne
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
shook
her
head
silently
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
only
last
night
she
said
to
me
,
"
Mamma
,
I
wonder
how
girls
manage
to
fall
in
love
.
<EOS>
It
is
easy
to
make
them
do
it
in
books
.
<EOS>
But
men
are
too
ridiculous
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
laughed
a
little
,
and
made
no
further
remark
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
The
next
morning
at
breakfast
he
said
    
"
How
are
your
bruises
,
Rex
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
not
very
mellow
yet
,
sir
;
only
beginning
to
turn
a
little
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
feel
quite
ready
for
a
journey
to
Southampton
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
quite
,
"
answered
Rex
,
with
his
heart
metaphorically
in
his
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
you
can
wait
till
to
-
morrow
,
and
go
to
say
goodbye
to
them
at
Offendene
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Gascoigne
,
who
now
knew
the
whole
affair
,
looked
steadily
at
her
coffee
lest
she
also
should
begin
to
cry
,
as
Anna
was
doing
already
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
felt
that
he
was
applying
a
sharp
remedy
to
poor
Rex
's
acute
attack
,
but
he
believed
it
to
be
in
the
end
the
kindest
.
<EOS>
To
let
him
know
the
hopelessness
of
his
love
from
Gwendolen
's
own
lips
might
be
curative
in
more
ways
than
one
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
only
be
thankful
that
she
does
n't
care
about
him
,
"
said
Mrs.
Gascoigne
,
when
she
joined
her
husband
in
his
study
.
<EOS>
"
There
are
things
in
Gwendolen
<EOS>
I
can
not
reconcile
myself
to
.
<EOS>
My
Anna
is
worth
two
of
her
,
with
all
her
beauty
and
talent
.
<EOS>
It
looks
very
ill
in
her
that
she
will
not
help
in
the
schools
with
Anna
 
not
even
in
the
Sunday
-
school
.
<EOS>
What
you
or
I
advise
is
of
no
consequence
to
her
:
and
poor
Fannie
is
completely
under
her
thumb
.
<EOS>
But
I
know
you
think
better
of
her
,
"
Mrs.
Gascoigne
ended
with
a
deferential
hesitation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
dear
,
there
is
no
harm
in
the
girl
.
<EOS>
It
is
only
that
she
has
a
high
spirit
,
and
it
will
not
do
to
hold
the
reins
too
tight
.
<EOS>
The
point
is
,
to
get
her
well
married
.
<EOS>
She
has
a
little
too
much
fire
in
her
for
her
present
life
with
her
mother
and
sisters
.
<EOS>
It
is
natural
and
right
that
she
should
be
married
soon
 
not
to
a
poor
man
,
but
one
who
can
give
her
a
fitting
position
.
"
  
<EOS>
Presently
Rex
,
with
his
arm
in
a
sling
,
was
on
his
two
miles
'
walk
to
Offendene
.
<EOS>
He
was
rather
puzzled
by
the
unconditional
permission
to
see
Gwendolen
,
but
his
father
's
real
ground
of
action
could
not
enter
into
his
conjectures
.
<EOS>
If
it
had
,
he
would
first
have
thought
it
horribly
cold
-
blooded
,
and
then
have
disbelieved
in
his
father
's
conclusions
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
got
to
the
house
,
everybody
was
there
but
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
The
four
girls
,
hearing
him
speak
in
the
hall
,
rushed
out
of
the
library
,
which
was
their
school
-
room
,
and
hung
round
him
with
compassionate
inquiries
about
his
arm
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
wanted
to
know
exactly
what
had
happened
,
and
where
the
blacksmith
lived
,
that
she
might
make
him
a
present
;
while
Miss
Merry
,
who
took
a
subdued
and
melancholy
part
in
all
family
affairs
,
doubted
whether
it
would
not
be
giving
too
much
encouragement
to
that
kind
of
character
.
<EOS>
Rex
had
never
found
the
family
troublesome
before
,
but
just
now
he
wished
them
all
away
and
Gwendolen
there
,
and
he
was
too
uneasy
for
good
-
natured
feigning
.
<EOS>
When
at
last
he
had
said
,
"
Where
is
Gwendolen
?
"
<EOS>
and
Mrs.
Davilow
had
told
Alice
to
go
and
see
if
her
sister
were
come
down
,
adding
,
"
I
sent
up
her
breakfast
this
morning
.
<EOS>
She
needed
a
long
rest
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Rex
took
the
shortest
way
out
of
his
endurance
by
saying
,
almost
impatiently
,
"
Aunt
,
I
want
to
speak
to
Gwendolen
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
see
her
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
dear
;
go
into
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
I
will
send
her
there
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
who
had
observed
that
he
was
fond
of
being
with
Gwendolen
,
as
was
natural
,
but
had
not
thought
of
this
as
having
any
bearing
on
the
realities
of
life
<EOS>
:
it
seemed
merely
part
of
the
Christmas
holidays
which
were
spinning
themselves
out
.
  
<EOS>
Rex
for
his
part
thought
that
the
realities
of
life
were
all
hanging
on
this
interview
.
<EOS>
He
had
to
walk
up
and
down
the
drawing
-
room
in
expectation
for
nearly
ten
minutes
 
ample
space
for
all
imaginative
fluctuations
;
yet
,
strange
to
say
,
he
was
unvaryingly
occupied
in
thinking
what
and
how
much
he
could
do
,
when
Gwendolen
had
accepted
him
,
to
satisfy
his
father
that
the
engagement
was
the
most
prudent
thing
in
the
world
,
since
it
inspired
him
with
double
energy
for
work
.
<EOS>
He
was
to
be
a
lawyer
,
and
what
reason
was
there
why
he
should
not
rise
as
high
as
Eldon
did
?
<EOS>
He
was
forced
to
look
at
life
in
the
light
of
his
father
's
mind
.
  
<EOS>
But
when
the
door
opened
and
she
whose
presence
he
was
longing
for
entered
,
there
came
over
him
suddenly
and
mysteriously
a
state
of
tremor
and
distrust
which
he
had
never
felt
before
.
<EOS>
Miss
Gwendolen
,
simple
as
she
stood
there
,
in
her
black
silk
,
cut
square
about
the
round
white
pillar
of
her
throat
,
a
black
band
fastening
her
hair
which
streamed
backward
in
smooth
silky
abundance
,
seemed
more
queenly
than
usual
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
was
that
there
was
none
of
the
latent
fun
and
tricksiness
which
had
always
pierced
in
her
greeting
of
Rex
.
<EOS>
How
much
of
this
was
due
to
her
presentiment
from
what
he
had
said
yesterday
that
he
was
going
to
talk
of
love
?
<EOS>
How
much
from
her
desire
to
show
regret
about
his
accident
?
<EOS>
Something
of
both
.
<EOS>
But
the
wisdom
of
ages
has
hinted
that
there
is
a
side
of
the
bed
which
has
a
malign
influence
if
you
happen
to
get
out
on
it
;
and
this
accident
befalls
some
charming
persons
rather
frequently
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
had
befallen
Gwendolen
this
morning
.
<EOS>
The
hastening
of
her
toilet
,
the
way
in
which
Bugle
used
the
brush
,
the
quality
of
the
shilling
serial
mistakenly
written
for
her
amusement
,
the
probabilities
of
the
coming
day
,
and
,
in
short
,
social
institutions
generally
,
were
all
objectionable
to
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
that
she
was
out
of
temper
,
but
that
the
world
was
not
equal
to
the
demands
of
her
fine
organism
.
  
<EOS>
However
it
might
be
,
Rex
saw
an
awful
majesty
about
her
as
she
entered
and
put
out
her
hand
to
him
,
without
the
least
approach
to
a
smile
in
eyes
or
mouth
.
<EOS>
The
fun
which
had
moved
her
in
the
evening
had
quite
evaporated
from
the
image
of
his
accident
,
and
the
whole
affair
seemed
stupid
to
her
.
<EOS>
But
she
said
with
perfect
propriety
,
"
I
hope
you
are
not
much
hurt
,
Rex
;
I
deserve
that
you
should
reproach
me
for
your
accident
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
at
all
,
"
said
Rex
,
feeling
the
soul
within
him
spreading
itself
like
an
attack
of
illness
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
hardly
any
thing
the
matter
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
so
glad
you
had
the
pleasure
:
I
would
willingly
pay
for
it
by
a
tumble
,
only
I
was
sorry
to
break
the
horse
's
knees
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
walked
to
the
hearth
and
stood
looking
at
the
fire
in
the
most
inconvenient
way
for
conversation
,
so
that
he
could
only
get
a
side
view
of
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
father
wants
me
to
go
to
Southampton
for
the
rest
of
the
vacation
,
"
said
Rex
,
his
baritone
trembling
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
Southampton
!
<EOS>
That
's
a
stupid
place
to
go
to
,
is
n't
it
?
"
said
Gwendolen
,
chilly
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
to
me
,
because
you
would
not
be
there
.
"
<EOS>
Silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Should
you
mind
about
me
going
away
,
Gwendolen
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
.
<EOS>
Every
one
is
of
consequence
in
this
dreary
country
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
curtly
.
<EOS>
The
perception
that
poor
Rex
wanted
to
be
tender
made
her
curl
up
and
harden
like
a
sea
-
anemone
at
the
touch
of
a
finger
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
angry
with
me
,
Gwendolen
?
<EOS>
Why
do
you
treat
me
in
this
way
all
at
once
?
"
said
Rex
,
flushing
,
and
with
more
spirit
in
his
voice
,
as
if
he
too
were
capable
of
being
angry
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
looked
round
at
him
and
smiled
.
<EOS>
"
Treat
you
?
<EOS>
Nonsense
!
<EOS>
I
am
only
rather
cross
.
<EOS>
Why
did
you
come
so
very
early
?
<EOS>
You
must
expect
to
find
tempers
in
dishabille
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Be
as
cross
with
me
as
you
like
 
only
do
n't
treat
me
with
indifference
,
"
said
Rex
,
imploringly
.
<EOS>
"
All
the
happiness
of
my
life
depends
on
your
loving
me
 
if
only
a
little
 
better
than
any
one
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
tried
to
take
her
hand
,
but
she
hastily
eluded
his
grasp
and
moved
to
the
other
end
of
the
hearth
,
facing
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
n't
make
love
to
me
!
<EOS>
I
hate
it
!
"
<EOS>
she
looked
at
him
fiercely
.
  
<EOS>
Rex
turned
pale
and
was
silent
,
but
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
her
,
and
the
impetus
was
not
yet
exhausted
that
made
hers
dart
death
at
him
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
herself
could
not
have
foreseen
that
she
should
feel
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
a
sudden
,
new
experience
to
her
.
<EOS>
The
day
before
she
had
been
quite
aware
that
her
cousin
was
in
love
with
her
;
she
did
not
mind
how
much
,
so
that
he
said
nothing
about
it
;
and
if
any
one
had
asked
her
why
she
objected
to
love
-
making
speeches
,
she
would
have
said
,
laughingly
,
"
<EOS>
Oh
I
am
tired
of
them
all
in
the
books
.
<EOS>
"
But
now
the
life
of
passion
had
begun
negatively
in
her
.
<EOS>
She
felt
passionately
averse
to
this
volunteered
love
.
  
<EOS>
To
Rex
at
twenty
the
joy
of
life
seemed
at
an
end
more
absolutely
than
it
can
do
to
a
man
at
forty
.
<EOS>
But
before
they
had
ceased
to
look
at
each
other
,
he
did
speak
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
last
word
you
have
to
say
to
me
,
Gwendolen
?
<EOS>
Will
it
always
be
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
could
not
help
seeing
his
wretchedness
and
feeling
a
little
regret
for
the
old
Rex
who
had
not
offended
her
.
<EOS>
Decisively
,
<EOS>
but
yet
with
some
return
of
kindness
,
she
said
    
"
About
making
love
?
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
dislike
you
for
anything
else
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
just
a
perceptible
pause
before
he
said
a
low
"
good
-
bye
.
"
and
passed
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
Almost
immediately
after
,
she
heard
the
heavy
hall
door
bang
behind
him
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
,
too
,
had
heard
Rex
's
hasty
departure
,
and
presently
came
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
where
she
found
Gwendolen
seated
on
the
low
couch
,
her
face
buried
,
and
her
hair
falling
over
her
figure
like
a
garment
.
<EOS>
She
was
sobbing
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
child
,
my
child
,
what
is
it
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
mother
,
who
had
never
before
seen
her
darling
struck
down
in
this
way
,
and
felt
something
of
the
alarmed
anguish
that
women
,
feel
at
the
sight
of
overpowering
sorrow
in
a
strong
man
;
for
this
child
had
been
her
ruler
.
<EOS>
Sitting
down
by
her
with
circling
arms
,
she
pressed
her
cheek
against
Gwendolen
's
head
,
and
then
tried
to
draw
it
upward
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
gave
way
,
and
letting
her
head
rest
against
her
mother
,
cried
out
sobbingly
,
"
Oh
,
mamma
,
what
can
become
of
my
life
?
<EOS>
there
is
nothing
worth
living
for
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
dear
?
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
.
<EOS>
Usually
she
herself
had
been
rebuked
by
her
daughter
for
involuntary
signs
of
despair
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
love
anybody
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
love
people
.
<EOS>
I
hate
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
time
will
come
,
dear
,
the
time
will
come
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
was
more
and
more
convulsed
with
sobbing
;
but
putting
her
arms
round
her
mother
's
neck
with
an
almost
painful
clinging
,
she
said
brokenly
,
"
I
ca
n't
bear
any
one
to
be
very
near
me
but
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Then
the
mother
began
to
sob
,
for
this
spoiled
child
had
never
shown
such
dependence
on
her
before
:
and
so
they
clung
to
each
other
.
      
<EOS>
What
name
doth
Joy
most
borrow
  
When
life
is
fair
?
                    
<EOS>
"
To
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
What
name
doth
best
fit
Sorrow
  
<EOS>
In
young
despair
?
                    
<EOS>
"
To
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
much
more
lasting
trouble
at
the
rectory
.
<EOS>
Rex
arrived
there
only
to
throw
himself
on
his
bed
in
a
state
of
apparent
apathy
,
unbroken
till
the
next
day
,
when
it
began
to
be
interrupted
by
more
positive
signs
of
illness
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
said
about
his
going
to
Southampton
:
instead
of
that
,
the
chief
thought
of
his
mother
and
Anna
was
how
to
tend
this
patient
who
did
not
want
to
be
well
,
and
from
being
the
brightest
,
most
grateful
spirit
in
the
household
,
was
metamorphosed
into
an
irresponsive
,
dull
-
eyed
creature
who
met
all
affectionate
attempts
with
a
murmur
of
"
Let
me
alone
.
"
<EOS>
His
father
looked
beyond
the
crisis
,
and
believed
it
to
be
the
shortest
way
out
of
an
unlucky
affair
;
but
he
was
sorry
for
the
inevitable
suffering
,
and
went
now
and
then
to
sit
by
him
in
silence
for
a
few
minutes
,
parting
with
a
gentle
pressure
of
his
hand
on
Rex
's
blank
brow
,
and
a
"
God
bless
you
,
my
boy
.
<EOS>
"
Warham
and
the
younger
children
used
to
peep
round
the
edge
of
the
door
to
see
this
incredible
thing
of
their
lively
brother
being
laid
low
;
but
fingers
were
immediately
shaken
at
them
to
drive
them
back
.
<EOS>
The
guardian
who
was
always
there
was
Anna
,
and
her
little
hand
was
allowed
to
rest
within
her
brother
's
,
though
he
never
gave
it
a
welcoming
pressure
.
<EOS>
Her
soul
was
divided
between
anguish
for
Rex
and
reproach
of
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
it
is
wicked
of
me
,
but
I
think
I
never
_
<EOS>
can
_
love
her
again
,
"
came
as
the
recurrent
burden
of
poor
little
Anna
's
inward
monody
.
<EOS>
And
even
Mrs.
Gascoigne
had
an
angry
feeling
toward
her
niece
which
she
could
not
refrain
from
expressing
(
apologetically
)
to
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
of
course
it
is
better
,
and
we
ought
to
be
thankful
that
she
is
not
in
love
with
the
poor
boy
;
but
really
.
<EOS>
Henry
,
I
think
she
is
hard
;
she
has
the
heart
of
a
coquette
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
thinking
that
she
must
have
made
him
believe
something
,
or
the
disappointment
would
not
have
taken
hold
of
him
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
And
some
blame
attaches
to
poor
Fanny
;
she
is
quite
blind
about
that
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
answered
imperatively
:
"
<EOS>
The
less
said
on
that
point
the
better
,
Nancy
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
been
more
awake
myself
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
boy
,
be
thankful
if
nothing
worse
ever
happens
to
him
.
<EOS>
Let
the
thing
die
out
as
quickly
as
possible
;
and
especially
with
regard
to
Gwendolen
 
<EOS>
let
it
be
as
if
it
had
never
been
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
rector
's
dominant
feeling
was
that
there
had
been
a
great
escape
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
in
love
with
Rex
in
return
would
have
made
a
much
harder
problem
,
the
solution
of
which
might
have
been
taken
out
of
his
hands
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
to
go
through
some
further
difficulty
.
  
<EOS>
One
fine
morning
Rex
asked
for
his
bath
,
and
made
his
toilet
as
usual
.
<EOS>
Anna
,
full
of
excitement
at
this
change
,
could
do
nothing
but
listen
for
his
coming
down
,
and
at
last
hearing
his
step
,
ran
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
to
meet
him
.
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
he
gave
her
a
faint
smile
,
but
it
looked
so
melancholy
on
his
pale
face
that
she
could
hardly
help
crying
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nannie
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
gently
,
taking
her
hand
and
leading
her
slowly
along
with
him
to
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
His
mother
was
there
,
and
when
she
came
to
kiss
him
,
he
said
:
"
What
a
plague
I
am
!
"
  
<EOS>
Then
he
sat
still
and
looked
out
of
the
bow
-
window
on
the
lawn
and
shrubs
covered
with
hoar
-
frost
,
across
which
the
sun
was
sending
faint
occasional
gleams
:
 
something
like
that
sad
smile
on
Rex
's
face
,
Anna
thought
.
<EOS>
He
felt
as
if
he
had
had
a
resurrection
into
a
new
world
,
and
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
himself
there
,
the
old
interests
being
left
behind
.
<EOS>
Anna
sat
near
him
,
pretending
to
work
,
but
really
watching
him
with
yearning
looks
.
<EOS>
Beyond
the
garden
hedge
there
was
a
road
where
wagons
and
carts
sometimes
went
on
field
-
work
:
a
railed
opening
was
made
in
the
hedge
,
because
the
upland
with
its
bordering
wood
and
clump
of
ash
-
trees
against
the
sky
was
a
pretty
sight
.
<EOS>
Presently
there
came
along
a
wagon
laden
with
timber
;
the
horses
were
straining
their
grand
muscles
,
and
the
driver
having
cracked
his
whip
,
ran
along
anxiously
to
guide
the
leader
's
head
,
fearing
a
swerve
.
<EOS>
Rex
seemed
to
be
shaken
into
attention
,
rose
and
looked
till
the
last
quivering
trunk
of
the
timber
had
disappeared
,
and
then
walked
once
or
twice
along
the
room
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Gascoigne
was
no
longer
there
,
and
when
he
came
to
sit
down
again
,
Anna
,
seeing
a
return
of
speech
in
her
brother
's
eyes
,
could
not
resist
the
impulse
to
bring
a
little
stool
and
seat
herself
against
his
knee
,
looking
up
at
him
with
an
expression
which
seemed
to
say
,
"
Do
speak
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
'm
thinking
of
,
Nannie
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
to
Canada
,
or
somewhere
of
that
sort
.
"
<EOS>
(
Rex
had
not
studied
the
character
of
our
colonial
possessions
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Rex
,
not
for
always
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
to
get
my
bread
there
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
build
a
hut
,
and
work
hard
at
clearing
,
and
have
everything
wild
about
me
,
and
a
great
wide
quiet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
not
take
me
with
you
?
"
<EOS>
said
Anna
,
the
big
tears
coming
fast
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
could
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
it
better
than
anything
;
and
settlers
go
with
their
families
.
<EOS>
I
would
sooner
go
there
than
stay
here
in
England
.
<EOS>
I
could
make
the
fires
,
and
mend
the
clothes
,
and
cook
the
food
;
and
I
could
learn
how
to
make
the
bread
before
we
went
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
nicer
than
anything
 
like
playing
at
life
over
again
,
as
we
used
to
do
when
we
made
our
tent
with
the
drugget
,
and
had
our
little
plates
and
dishes
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Father
and
mother
would
not
let
you
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
think
they
would
,
when
I
explained
everything
.
<EOS>
It
would
save
money
;
and
papa
would
have
more
to
bring
up
the
boys
with
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
further
talk
of
the
same
practical
kind
at
intervals
,
and
it
ended
in
Rex
's
being
obliged
to
consent
that
Anna
should
go
with
him
when
he
spoke
to
his
father
on
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
Of
course
it
was
when
the
rector
was
alone
in
his
study
.
<EOS>
Their
mother
would
become
reconciled
to
whatever
he
decided
on
,
but
mentioned
to
her
first
,
the
question
would
have
distressed
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
children
!
"
said
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
cheerfully
,
as
they
entered
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
comfort
to
see
Rex
about
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
we
sit
down
with
you
a
little
,
papa
?
"
said
Anna
.
<EOS>
"
Rex
has
something
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
With
all
my
heart
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
noticeable
group
that
these
three
creatures
made
,
each
of
them
with
a
face
of
the
same
structural
type
 
<EOS>
the
straight
brow
,
the
nose
suddenly
straightened
from
an
intention
of
being
aquiline
,
the
short
upper
lip
,
the
short
but
strong
and
well
-
hung
chin
:
<EOS>
there
was
even
the
same
tone
of
complexion
and
set
of
the
eye
.
<EOS>
The
gray
-
haired
father
was
at
once
massive
and
keen
-
looking
;
there
was
a
perpendicular
line
in
his
brow
which
when
he
spoke
with
any
force
of
interest
deepened
;
and
the
habit
of
ruling
gave
him
an
air
of
reserved
authoritativeness
.
<EOS>
Rex
would
have
seemed
a
vision
of
his
father
's
youth
,
if
it
had
been
possible
to
imagine
Mr.
Gascoigne
without
distinct
plans
and
without
command
,
smitten
with
a
heart
sorrow
,
and
having
no
more
notion
of
concealment
than
a
sick
animal
;
and
Anna
was
a
tiny
copy
of
Rex
,
with
hair
drawn
back
and
knotted
,
<EOS>
her
face
following
his
in
its
changes
of
expression
,
as
if
they
had
one
soul
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
all
about
what
has
upset
me
,
father
,
"
Rex
began
,
and
Mr.
Gascoigne
nodded
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
done
up
for
life
in
this
part
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
it
will
be
no
use
my
going
back
to
Oxford
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
do
any
reading
.
<EOS>
I
should
fail
,
and
cause
you
expense
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
have
your
consent
to
take
another
course
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
nodded
more
slowly
,
the
perpendicular
line
on
his
brow
deepened
,
and
Anna
's
trembling
increased
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
would
allow
me
a
small
outfit
,
I
should
like
to
go
to
the
colonies
and
work
on
the
land
there
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Rex
thought
the
vagueness
of
the
phrase
prudential
;
"
the
colonies
"
necessarily
embracing
more
advantages
,
and
being
less
capable
of
being
rebutted
on
a
single
ground
than
any
particular
settlement
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
and
with
me
,
papa
,
"
said
Anna
,
not
bearing
to
be
left
out
from
the
proposal
even
temporarily
.
<EOS>
"
Rex
would
want
some
one
to
take
care
of
him
,
you
know
 
<EOS>
some
one
to
keep
house
.
<EOS>
And
we
shall
never
,
either
of
us
,
be
married
.
<EOS>
And
I
should
cost
nothing
,
and
I
should
be
so
happy
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
would
be
hard
to
leave
you
and
mamma
;
but
there
are
all
the
others
to
bring
up
,
and
we
two
should
be
no
trouble
to
you
any
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anna
had
risen
from
her
seat
,
and
used
the
feminine
argument
of
going
closer
to
her
papa
as
she
spoke
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
smile
,
but
he
drew
her
on
his
knee
and
held
her
there
,
as
if
to
put
her
gently
out
of
the
question
while
he
spoke
to
Rex
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
admit
that
my
experience
gives
me
some
power
of
judging
for
you
,
and
that
I
can
probably
guide
you
in
practical
matters
better
than
you
can
guide
yourself
?
"
  
<EOS>
Rex
was
obliged
to
say
,
"
Yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
perhaps
you
will
admit
 
though
I
do
n't
wish
to
press
that
point
 
that
you
are
bound
in
duty
to
consider
my
judgment
and
wishes
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
yet
placed
myself
in
opposition
to
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
Rex
in
his
secret
soul
could
not
feel
that
he
was
bound
not
to
go
to
the
colonies
,
but
to
go
to
Oxford
again
 
which
was
the
point
in
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
do
so
if
you
persist
in
setting
your
mind
toward
a
rash
and
foolish
procedure
,
and
deafening
yourself
to
considerations
which
my
experience
of
life
assures
me
of
.
<EOS>
You
think
,
I
suppose
,
that
you
have
had
a
shock
which
has
changed
all
your
inclinations
,
stupefied
your
brains
,
unfitted
you
for
anything
but
manual
labor
,
and
given
you
a
dislike
to
society
?
<EOS>
Is
that
what
you
believe
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Something
like
that
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
be
up
to
the
sort
of
work
I
must
do
to
live
in
this
part
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
spirit
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
be
the
same
again
.
<EOS>
And
without
any
disrespect
to
you
,
father
,
I
think
a
young
fellow
should
be
allowed
to
choose
his
way
of
life
,
if
he
does
nobody
any
harm
.
<EOS>
There
are
plenty
to
stay
at
home
,
and
those
who
like
might
be
allowed
to
go
where
there
are
empty
places
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
suppose
I
am
convinced
on
good
evidence
 
as
I
am
 
that
this
state
of
mind
of
yours
is
transient
,
and
that
if
you
went
off
as
you
propose
,
you
would
by
-
and
-
by
repent
,
and
feel
that
you
had
let
yourself
slip
back
from
the
point
you
have
been
gaining
by
your
education
till
now
?
<EOS>
Have
you
not
strength
of
mind
enough
to
see
that
you
had
better
act
on
my
assurance
for
a
time
,
and
test
it
?
<EOS>
In
my
opinion
,
so
far
from
agreeing
with
you
that
you
should
be
free
to
turn
yourself
into
a
colonist
and
work
in
your
shirt
-
sleeves
with
spade
and
hatchet
 
in
my
opinion
<EOS>
you
have
no
right
whatever
to
expatriate
yourself
until
you
have
honestly
endeavored
to
turn
to
account
the
education
you
have
received
here
.
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
of
the
grief
to
your
mother
and
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
very
sorry
;
but
what
can
I
do
?
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
study
 
<EOS>
that
's
certain
,
"
said
Rex
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
just
now
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
You
will
have
to
miss
a
term
.
<EOS>
I
have
made
arrangements
for
you
 
how
you
are
to
spend
the
next
two
months
.
<EOS>
But
I
confess
I
am
disappointed
in
you
,
Rex
.
<EOS>
I
thought
you
had
more
sense
than
to
take
up
such
ideas
 
to
suppose
that
because
you
have
fallen
into
a
very
common
trouble
,
such
as
most
men
have
to
go
through
,
you
are
loosened
from
all
bonds
of
duty
 
just
as
if
your
brain
had
softened
and
you
were
no
longer
a
responsible
being
.
"
  
<EOS>
What
could
Rex
say
?
<EOS>
Inwardly
he
was
in
a
state
of
rebellion
,
but
he
had
no
arguments
to
meet
his
father
's
;
and
while
he
was
feeling
,
in
spite
of
any
thing
that
might
be
said
,
that
he
should
like
to
go
off
to
"
the
colonies
"
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
,
it
lay
in
a
deep
fold
of
his
consciousness
that
he
ought
to
feel
 
if
he
had
been
a
better
fellow
he
would
have
felt
 
more
about
his
old
ties
.
<EOS>
This
is
the
sort
of
faith
we
live
by
in
our
soul
sicknesses
.
  
<EOS>
Rex
got
up
from
his
seat
,
as
if
he
held
the
conference
to
be
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
assent
to
my
arrangement
,
then
?
"
said
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
with
that
distinct
resolution
of
tone
which
seems
to
hold
one
in
a
vise
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
little
pause
before
Rex
answered
,
"
I
'll
try
what
I
can
do
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
promise
.
<EOS>
"
His
thought
was
,
that
trying
would
be
of
no
use
.
  
<EOS>
Her
father
kept
Anna
,
holding
her
fast
,
though
she
wanted
to
follow
Rex
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
papa
,
"
she
said
,
the
tears
coming
with
her
words
when
the
door
had
closed
;
"
it
is
very
hard
for
him
.
<EOS>
Does
n't
he
look
ill
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
but
he
will
soon
be
better
;
it
will
all
blow
over
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
Anna
,
be
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
about
it
all
.
<EOS>
Never
let
it
be
mentioned
when
he
is
gone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
papa
.
<EOS>
But
I
would
not
be
like
Gwendolen
for
any
thing
 
to
have
people
fall
in
love
with
me
so
.
<EOS>
It
is
very
dreadful
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anna
dared
not
say
that
she
was
disappointed
at
not
being
allowed
to
go
to
the
colonies
with
Rex
;
but
that
was
her
secret
feeling
,
and
she
often
afterward
went
inwardly
over
the
whole
affair
,
saying
to
herself
,
"
I
should
have
done
with
going
out
,
and
gloves
,
and
crinoline
,
and
having
to
talk
when
I
am
taken
to
dinner
 
and
all
that
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
like
to
mark
the
time
,
and
connect
the
course
of
individual
lives
with
the
historic
stream
,
for
all
classes
of
thinkers
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
period
when
the
broadening
of
gauge
in
crinolines
seemed
to
demand
an
agitation
for
the
general
enlargement
of
churches
,
ball
-
rooms
,
and
vehicles
.
<EOS>
But
Anna
Gascoigne
's
figure
would
only
allow
the
size
of
skirt
manufactured
for
young
ladies
of
fourteen
.
      
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
thee
,
Berthold
,
what
men
's
hopes
are
like
:
  
<EOS>
A
silly
child
that
,
quivering
with
joy
,
  
Would
cast
its
little
mimic
fishing
-
line
  
Baited
with
loadstone
for
a
bowl
of
toys
  
<EOS>
In
the
salt
ocean
.
   
<EOS>
Eight
months
after
the
arrival
of
the
family
at
Offendene
,
that
is
to
say
in
the
end
of
the
following
June
,
a
rumor
was
spread
in
the
neighborhood
which
to
many
persons
was
matter
of
exciting
interest
.
<EOS>
It
had
no
reference
to
the
results
of
the
American
war
,
but
it
was
one
which
touched
all
classes
within
a
certain
circuit
round
Wanchester
:
<EOS>
the
corn
-
factors
,
the
brewers
,
the
horse
-
dealers
,
and
saddlers
,
all
held
it
a
laudable
thing
,
and
one
which
was
to
be
rejoiced
in
on
abstract
grounds
,
as
showing
the
value
of
an
aristocracy
in
a
free
country
like
England
;
the
blacksmith
in
the
hamlet
of
Diplow
felt
that
a
good
time
had
come
round
;
the
wives
of
laboring
men
hoped
their
nimble
boys
of
ten
or
twelve
would
be
taken
into
employ
by
the
gentlemen
in
livery
;
and
the
farmers
about
Diplow
admitted
,
with
a
tincture
of
bitterness
and
reserve
that
a
man
might
now
again
perhaps
have
an
easier
market
or
exchange
for
a
rick
of
old
hay
or
a
wagon
-
load
of
straw
.
<EOS>
If
such
were
the
hopes
of
low
persons
not
in
society
,
it
may
be
easily
inferred
that
their
betters
had
better
reasons
for
satisfaction
,
probably
connected
with
the
pleasures
of
life
rather
than
its
business
.
<EOS>
Marriage
,
however
,
must
be
considered
as
coming
under
both
heads
;
and
just
as
when
a
visit
of
majesty
is
announced
,
the
dream
of
knighthood
or
a
baronetcy
is
to
be
found
under
various
municipal
nightcaps
,
so
the
news
in
question
raised
a
floating
indeterminate
vision
of
marriage
in
several
well
-
bred
imaginations
.
  
<EOS>
The
news
was
that
Diplow
Hall
,
Sir
Hugo
Mallinger
's
place
,
which
had
for
a
couple
of
years
turned
its
white
window
-
shutters
in
a
painfully
wall
-
eyed
manner
on
its
fine
elms
and
beeches
,
its
lilied
pool
and
grassy
acres
specked
with
deer
,
was
being
prepared
for
a
tenant
,
and
was
for
the
rest
of
the
summer
and
through
the
hunting
season
to
be
inhabited
in
a
fitting
style
both
as
to
house
and
stable
.
<EOS>
But
not
by
Sir
Hugo
himself
:
by
his
nephew
,
Mr.
Mallinger
Grandcourt
,
who
was
presumptive
heir
to
the
baronetcy
,
his
uncle
's
marriage
having
produced
nothing
but
girls
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
this
the
only
contingency
with
which
fortune
flattered
young
Grandcourt
,
as
he
was
pleasantly
called
;
for
while
the
chance
of
the
baronetcy
came
through
his
father
,
his
mother
had
given
a
baronial
streak
to
his
blood
,
so
that
if
certain
intervening
persons
slightly
painted
in
the
middle
distance
died
,
he
would
become
a
baron
and
peer
of
this
realm
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
the
uneven
allotment
of
nature
that
the
male
bird
alone
has
the
tuft
,
but
we
have
not
yet
followed
the
advice
of
hasty
philosophers
who
would
have
us
copy
nature
entirely
in
these
matters
;
and
if
Mr.
Mallinger
Grandcourt
became
a
baronet
or
a
peer
,
his
wife
would
share
the
title
 
which
in
addition
to
his
actual
fortune
was
certainly
a
reason
why
that
wife
,
being
at
present
unchosen
,
should
be
thought
of
by
more
than
one
person
with
a
sympathetic
interest
as
a
woman
sure
to
be
well
provided
for
.
  
<EOS>
Some
readers
of
this
history
will
doubtless
regard
it
as
incredible
that
people
should
construct
matrimonial
prospects
on
the
mere
report
that
a
bachelor
of
good
fortune
and
possibilities
was
coming
within
reach
,
and
will
reject
the
statement
as
a
mere
outflow
of
gall
:
they
will
aver
that
neither
they
nor
their
first
cousins
have
minds
so
unbridled
;
and
that
in
fact
this
is
not
human
nature
,
which
would
know
that
such
speculations
might
turn
out
to
be
fallacious
,
and
would
therefore
not
entertain
them
.
<EOS>
But
,
let
it
be
observed
,
nothing
is
here
narrated
of
human
nature
generally
:
the
history
in
its
present
stage
concerns
only
a
few
people
in
a
corner
of
Wessex
 
whose
reputation
,
however
,
was
unimpeached
,
and
who
,
I
am
in
the
proud
position
of
being
able
to
state
,
were
all
on
visiting
terms
with
persons
of
rank
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
the
Arrowpoints
,
for
example
,
in
their
beautiful
place
at
Quetcham
:
no
one
could
attribute
sordid
views
in
relation
to
their
daughter
's
marriage
to
parents
who
could
leave
her
at
least
half
a
million
;
but
having
affectionate
anxieties
about
their
Catherine
's
position
(
she
having
resolutely
refused
Lord
Slogan
,
an
unexceptionable
Irish
peer
,
whose
estate
wanted
nothing
but
drainage
and
population
)
,
they
wondered
,
perhaps
from
something
more
than
a
charitable
impulse
,
whether
Mr.
Grandcourt
was
good
-
looking
,
of
sound
constitution
,
virtuous
,
or
at
least
reformed
,
and
if
liberal
-
conservative
,
not
too
liberal
-
conservative
;
and
without
wishing
anybody
to
die
,
thought
his
succession
to
the
title
an
event
to
be
desired
.
  
<EOS>
If
the
Arrowpoints
had
such
ruminations
,
it
is
the
less
surprising
that
they
were
stimulated
in
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
who
for
being
a
clergyman
was
not
the
less
subject
to
the
anxieties
of
a
parent
and
guardian
;
and
we
have
seen
how
both
he
and
Mrs.
Gascoigne
might
by
this
time
have
come
to
feel
that
he
was
overcharged
with
the
management
of
young
creatures
who
were
hardly
to
be
held
in
with
bit
or
bridle
,
or
any
sort
of
metaphor
that
would
stand
for
judicious
advice
.
  
<EOS>
Naturally
,
people
did
not
tell
each
other
all
they
felt
and
thought
about
young
Grandcourt
's
advent
:
on
no
subject
is
this
openness
found
prudently
practicable
 
not
even
on
the
generation
of
acids
,
or
the
destination
of
the
fixed
stars
:
for
either
your
contemporary
with
a
mind
turned
toward
the
same
subjects
may
find
your
ideas
ingenious
and
forestall
you
in
applying
them
,
or
he
may
have
other
views
on
acids
and
fixed
stars
,
and
think
ill
of
you
in
consequence
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
did
not
ask
Mr.
Arrowpoint
if
he
had
any
trustworthy
source
of
information
about
Grandcourt
considered
as
a
husband
for
a
charming
girl
;
nor
did
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
observe
to
Mrs.
Davilow
that
if
the
possible
peer
sought
a
wife
in
the
neighborhood
of
Diplow
,
the
only
reasonable
expectation
was
that
he
would
offer
his
hand
to
Catherine
,
who
,
however
,
would
not
accept
him
unless
he
were
in
all
respects
fitted
to
secure
her
happiness
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
even
to
his
wife
the
rector
was
silent
as
to
the
contemplation
of
any
matrimonial
result
,
from
the
probability
that
Mr.
Grandcourt
would
see
Gwendolen
at
the
next
Archery
Meeting
;
though
Mrs.
Gascoigne
's
mind
was
very
likely
still
more
active
in
the
same
direction
.
<EOS>
She
had
said
interjectionally
to
her
sister
,
"
It
would
be
a
mercy
,
Fanny
,
if
that
girl
were
well
married
!
"
<EOS>
to
which
Mrs.
Davilow
discerning
some
criticism
of
her
darling
in
the
fervor
of
that
wish
,
had
not
chosen
to
make
any
audible
reply
,
though
she
had
said
inwardly
,
"
You
will
not
get
her
to
marry
for
your
pleasure
"
;
the
mild
mother
becoming
rather
saucy
when
she
identified
herself
with
her
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
To
her
husband
Mrs.
Gascoigne
said
,
"
I
hear
Mr.
Grandcourt
has
got
two
places
of
his
own
,
but
he
comes
to
Diplow
for
the
hunting
.
<EOS>
It
is
to
be
hoped
he
will
set
a
good
example
in
the
neighborhood
.
<EOS>
Have
you
heard
what
sort
of
a
young
man
he
is
,
Henry
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
had
not
heard
;
at
least
,
if
his
male
acquaintances
had
gossiped
in
his
hearing
,
he
was
not
disposed
to
repeat
their
gossip
,
or
to
give
it
any
emphasis
in
his
own
mind
.
<EOS>
He
held
it
futile
,
even
if
it
had
been
becoming
,
to
show
any
curiosity
as
to
the
past
of
a
young
man
whose
birth
,
wealth
,
and
consequent
leisure
made
many
habits
venial
which
under
other
circumstances
would
have
been
inexcusable
.
<EOS>
Whatever
Grandcourt
had
done
,
he
had
not
ruined
himself
;
and
it
is
well
-
known
that
in
gambling
,
for
example
,
whether
of
the
business
or
holiday
sort
,
a
man
who
has
the
strength
of
mind
to
leave
off
when
he
has
only
ruined
others
,
is
a
reformed
character
.
<EOS>
This
is
an
illustration
merely
:
Mr.
Gascoigne
had
not
heard
that
Grandcourt
had
been
a
gambler
;
and
we
can
hardly
pronounce
him
singular
in
feeling
that
a
landed
proprietor
with
a
mixture
of
noble
blood
in
his
veins
was
not
to
be
an
object
of
suspicious
inquiry
like
a
reformed
character
who
offers
himself
as
your
butler
or
footman
.
<EOS>
Reformation
,
where
a
man
can
afford
to
do
without
it
,
can
hardly
be
other
than
genuine
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
it
was
not
certain
on
any
other
showing
hitherto
,
that
Mr.
Grandcourt
had
needed
reformation
more
than
other
young
men
in
the
ripe
youth
of
five
-
and
-
thirty
;
and
,
at
any
rate
,
the
significance
of
what
he
had
been
must
be
determined
by
what
he
actually
was
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
,
too
,
although
she
would
not
respond
to
her
sister
's
pregnant
remark
,
could
not
be
inwardly
indifferent
to
an
advent
that
might
promise
a
brilliant
lot
for
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
A
little
speculation
on
"
what
may
be
"
comes
naturally
,
without
encouragement
 
comes
inevitably
in
the
form
of
images
,
when
unknown
persons
are
mentioned
;
and
Mr.
Grandcourt
's
name
raised
in
Mrs.
Davilow
's
mind
first
of
all
the
picture
of
a
handsome
,
accomplished
,
excellent
young
man
whom
she
would
be
satisfied
with
as
a
husband
for
her
daughter
;
but
then
came
the
further
speculation
 
would
Gwendolen
be
satisfied
with
him
?
<EOS>
There
was
no
knowing
what
would
meet
that
girl
's
taste
or
touch
her
affections
 
<EOS>
it
might
be
something
else
than
excellence
;
and
thus
the
image
of
the
perfect
suitor
gave
way
before
a
fluctuating
combination
of
qualities
that
might
be
imagined
to
win
Gwendolen
's
heart
.
<EOS>
In
the
difficulty
of
arriving
at
the
particular
combination
which
would
insure
that
result
,
the
mother
even
said
to
herself
,
"
It
would
not
signify
about
her
being
in
love
,
if
she
would
only
accept
the
right
person
.
"
<EOS>
For
whatever
marriage
had
been
for
herself
,
how
could
she
the
less
desire
it
for
her
daughter
?
<EOS>
The
difference
her
own
misfortunes
made
was
,
that
she
never
dared
to
dwell
much
to
Gwendolen
on
the
desirableness
of
marriage
,
dreading
an
answer
something
like
that
of
the
future
Madame
Roland
,
when
her
gentle
mother
urging
the
acceptance
of
a
suitor
,
said
,
"
Tu
seras
heureuse
,
ma
chère
.
"
<EOS>
"
Oui
,
maman
,
comme
toi
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
relation
to
the
problematic
Mr.
Grandcourt
least
of
all
would
Mrs.
Davilow
have
willingly
let
fall
a
hint
of
the
aerial
castle
-
building
which
she
had
the
good
taste
to
be
ashamed
of
;
for
such
a
hint
was
likely
enough
to
give
an
adverse
poise
to
Gwendolen
's
own
thought
,
and
make
her
detest
the
desirable
husband
beforehand
.
<EOS>
Since
that
scene
after
poor
Rex
's
farewell
visit
,
the
mother
had
felt
a
new
sense
of
peril
in
touching
the
mystery
of
her
child
's
feeling
,
and
in
rashly
determining
what
was
her
welfare
:
only
she
could
think
of
welfare
in
no
other
shape
than
marriage
.
  
<EOS>
The
discussion
of
the
dress
that
Gwendolen
was
to
wear
at
the
Archery
Meeting
was
a
relevant
topic
,
however
;
and
when
it
had
been
decided
that
as
a
touch
of
color
on
her
white
cashmere
,
nothing
,
for
her
complexion
,
was
comparable
to
pale
green
 
<EOS>
a
feather
which
she
was
trying
in
her
hat
before
the
looking
-
glass
having
settled
the
question
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
felt
her
ears
tingle
when
Gwendolen
,
suddenly
throwing
herself
into
the
attitude
of
drawing
her
bow
,
said
with
a
look
of
comic
enjoyment
    
<EOS>
"
How
I
pity
all
the
other
girls
at
the
Archery
Meeting
 
<EOS>
all
thinking
of
Mr.
Grandcourt
!
<EOS>
And
they
have
not
a
shadow
of
a
chance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
had
not
the
presence
of
mind
to
answer
immediately
,
and
Gwendolen
turned
round
quickly
toward
her
,
saying
,
wickedly
    
"
Now
you
know
they
have
not
,
mamma
.
<EOS>
You
and
my
uncle
and
aunt
 
<EOS>
you
all
intend
him
to
fall
in
love
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
,
piqued
into
a
little
stratagem
,
said
,
"
Oh
,
my
,
dear
,
that
is
not
so
certain
.
<EOS>
Miss
Arrowpoint
has
charms
which
you
have
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
but
they
demand
thought
.
<EOS>
My
arrow
will
pierce
him
before
he
has
time
for
thought
.
<EOS>
He
will
declare
himself
my
slave
 
<EOS>
I
shall
send
him
round
the
world
to
bring
me
back
the
wedding
ring
of
a
happy
woman
 
in
the
meantime
all
the
men
who
are
between
him
and
the
title
will
die
of
different
diseases
 
<EOS>
he
will
come
back
Lord
Grandcourt
 
<EOS>
but
without
the
ring
 
and
fall
at
my
feet
.
<EOS>
I
shall
laugh
at
him
 
he
will
rise
in
resentment
 
<EOS>
I
shall
laugh
more
 
<EOS>
he
will
call
for
his
steed
and
ride
to
Quetcham
,
where
he
will
find
Miss
Arrowpoint
just
married
to
a
needy
musician
,
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
tearing
her
cap
off
,
and
Mr.
Arrowpoint
standing
by
.
<EOS>
Exit

Grandcourt

returns

Diplow

"
  
<EOS>
Was
ever
any
young
witch
like
this
?
<EOS>
You
thought
of
hiding
things
from
her
 
sat
upon
your
secret
and
looked
innocent
,
and
all
the
while
she
knew
by
the
corner
of
your
eye
that
it
was
exactly
five
pounds
ten
you
were
sitting
on
!
<EOS>
As
well
turn
the
key
to
keep
out
the
damp
!
<EOS>
It
was
probable
that
by
dint
of
divination
she
already
knew
more
than
any
one
else
did
of
Mr.
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
That
idea
in
Mrs.
Davilow
's
mind
prompted
the
sort
of
question
which
often
comes
without
any
other
apparent
reason
than
the
faculty
of
speech
and
the
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
kind
of
a
man
do
you
imagine
him
to
be
,
Gwendolen
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
!
"
said
the
witch
,
putting
her
forefinger
to
her
lips
,
with
a
little
frown
,
and
then
stretching
out
the
finger
with
decision
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Short
 
just
above
my
shoulder
 
crying
to
make
himself
tall
by
turning
up
his
mustache
and
keeping
his
beard
long
 
a
glass
in
his
right
eye
to
give
him
an
air
of
distinction
 
a
strong
opinion
about
his
waistcoat
,
but
uncertain
and
trimming
about
the
weather
,
on
which
he
will
try
to
draw
me
out
.
<EOS>
He
will
stare
at
me
all
the
while
,
and
the
glass
in
his
eye
will
cause
him
to
make
horrible
faces
,
especially
when
he
smiles
in
a
flattering
way
.
<EOS>
I
shall
cast
down
my
eyes
in
consequence
,
and
he
will
perceive
that
I
am
not
indifferent
to
his
attentions
.
<EOS>
I
shall
dream
that
night
that
I
am
looking
at
the
extraordinary
face
of
a
magnified
insect
 
and
<EOS>
the
next
morning
he
will
make
an
offer
of
his
hand
;
the
sequel
as
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
a
portrait
of
some
one
you
have
seen
already
,
Gwen
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grandcourt
may
be
a
delightful
young
man
for
what
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
with
a
high
note
of
careless
admission
,
taking
off
her
best
hat
and
turning
it
round
on
her
hand
contemplatively
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
what
sort
of
behavior
a
delightful
young
man
would
have
?
<EOS>
I
know
he
would
have
hunters
and
racers
,
and
a
London
house
and
two
country
-
houses
 
one
with
battlements
and
another
with
a
veranda
.
<EOS>
And
I
feel
sure
that
with
a
little
murdering
he
might
get
a
title
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
irony
of
this
speech
was
of
the
doubtful
sort
that
has
some
genuine
belief
mixed
up
with
it
.
<EOS>
Poor
Mrs.
Davilow
felt
uncomfortable
under
it
.
<EOS>
Her
own
meanings
being
usually
literal
and
in
intention
innocent
;
and
she
said
with
a
distressed
brow
:
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
talk
in
that
way
,
child
,
for
heaven
's
sake
!
<EOS>
you
do
read
such
books
 
<EOS>
they
give
you
such
ideas
of
everything
.
<EOS>
I
declare
when
your
aunt
and
I
were
your
age
we
knew
nothing
about
wickedness
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
was
better
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
did
you
not
bring
me
up
in
that
way
,
mamma
?
"
said
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
But
immediately
perceiving
in
the
crushed
look
and
rising
sob
that
she
had
given
a
deep
wound
,
she
tossed
down
her
hat
and
knelt
at
her
mother
's
feet
crying
    
"
Mamma
,
mamma
!
<EOS>
I
was
only
speaking
in
fun
.
<EOS>
I
meant
nothing
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
could
I
,
Gwendolen
?
"
said
poor
Mrs.
Davilow
,
unable
to
hear
the
retraction
,
and
sobbing
violently
while
she
made
the
effort
to
speak
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
will
was
always
too
strong
for
me
 
if
everything
else
had
been
different
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
disjoined
logic
was
intelligible
enough
to
the
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dear
mamma
,
I
do
n't
find
fault
with
you
 
<EOS>
I
love
you
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
really
compunctious
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
can
you
help
what
I
am
?
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
am
very
charming
.
<EOS>
Come
,
now
.
"
<EOS>
Here
Gwendolen
with
her
handkerchief
gently
rubbed
away
her
mother
's
tears
.
"
<EOS>
Really
 
I
am
contented
with
myself
.
<EOS>
I
like
myself
better
than
I
should
have
liked
my
aunt
and
you
.
<EOS>
How
dreadfully
dull
you
must
have
been
!
"
  
<EOS>
Such
tender
cajolery
served
to
quiet
the
mother
,
as
it
had
often
done
before
after
like
collisions
.
<EOS>
Not
that
the
collisions
had
often
been
repeated
at
the
same
point
;
for
in
the
memory
of
both
they
left
an
association
of
dread
with
the
particular
topics
which
had
occasioned
them
:
Gwendolen
dreaded
the
unpleasant
sense
of
compunction
toward
her
mother
,
which
was
the
nearest
approach
to
self
-
condemnation
and
self
-
distrust
that
she
had
known
;
and
Mrs.
Davilow
's
timid
maternal
conscience
dreaded
whatever
had
brought
on
the
slightest
hint
of
reproach
.
<EOS>
Hence
,
after
this
little
scene
,
the
two
concurred
in
excluding
Mr.
Grandcourt
from
their
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Gascoigne
once
or
twice
referred
to
him
,
Mrs.
Davilow
feared
least
Gwendolen
should
betray
some
of
her
alarming
keen
-
sightedness
about
what
was
probably
in
her
uncle
's
mind
;
but
the
fear
was
not
justified
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
knew
certain
differences
in
the
characters
with
which
she
was
concerned
as
birds
know
climate
and
weather
;
and
for
the
very
reason
that
she
was
determined
to
evade
her
uncle
's
control
,
she
was
determined
not
to
clash
with
him
.
<EOS>
The
good
understanding
between
them
was
much
fostered
by
their
enjoyment
of
archery
together
:
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
as
one
of
the
best
bowmen
in
Wessex
,
was
gratified
to
find
the
elements
of
like
skill
in
his
niece
;
and
Gwendolen
was
the
more
careful
not
to
lose
the
shelter
of
his
fatherly
indulgence
,
because
since
the
trouble
with
Rex
both
Mrs.
Gascoigne
and
Anna
had
been
unable
to
hide
what
she
felt
to
be
a
very
unreasonable
alienation
from
her
.
<EOS>
Toward
Anna
she
took
some
pains
to
behave
with
a
regretful
affectionateness
;
but
neither
of
them
dared
to
mention
Rex
's
name
,
and
Anna
,
to
whom
the
thought
of
him
was
part
of
the
air
she
breathed
,
was
ill
at
ease
with
the
lively
cousin
who
had
ruined
his
happiness
.
<EOS>
She
tried
dutifully
to
repress
any
sign
of
her
changed
feeling
;
but
who
in
pain
can
imitate
the
glance
and
hand
-
touch
of
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
This
unfair
resentment
had
rather
a
hardening
effect
on
Gwendolen
,
and
threw
her
into
a
more
defiant
temper
.
<EOS>
Her
uncle
too
might
be
offended
if
she
refused
the
next
person
who
fell
in
love
with
her
;
and
one
day
when
that
idea
was
in
her
mind
<EOS>
she
said
    
<EOS>
"
Mamma
,
I
see
now
why
girls
are
glad
to
be
married
 
to
escape
being
expected
to
please
everybody
but
themselves
.
"
  
<EOS>
Happily
,
Mr.
Middleton
was
gone
without
having
made
any
avowal
;
and
notwithstanding
the
admiration
for
the
handsome
Miss
Harleth
,
extending
perhaps
over
thirty
square
miles
in
a
part
of
Wessex
well
studded
with
families
whose
numbers
included
several
disengaged
young
men
,
each
glad
to
seat
himself
by
the
lively
girl
with
whom
it
was
so
easy
to
get
on
in
conversation
,
 
notwithstanding
these
grounds
for
arguing
that
Gwendolen
was
likely
to
have
other
suitors
more
explicit
than
the
cautious
curate
,
the
fact
was
not
so
.
  
<EOS>
Care
has
been
taken
not
only
that
the
trees
should
not
sweep
the
stars
down
,
but
also
that
every
man
who
admires
a
fair
girl
should
not
be
enamored
of
her
,
and
even
that
every
man
who
is
enamored
should
not
necessarily
declare
himself
.
<EOS>
There
are
various
refined
shapes
in
which
the
price
of
corn
,
known
to
be
potent
cause
in
their
relation
,
might
,
if
inquired
into
,
show
why
a
young
lady
,
perfect
in
person
,
accomplishments
,
and
costume
,
has
not
the
trouble
of
rejecting
many
offers
;
and
nature
's
order
is
certainly
benignant
in
not
obliging
us
one
and
all
to
be
desperately
in
love
with
the
most
admirable
mortal
we
have
ever
seen
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
we
know
,
was
far
from
holding
that
supremacy
in
the
minds
of
all
observers
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
it
was
but
a
poor
eight
months
since
she
had
come
to
Offendene
,
and
some
inclinations
become
manifest
slowly
,
like
the
sunward
creeping
of
plants
.
  
<EOS>
In
face
of
this
fact
that
not
one
of
the
eligible
young
men
already
in
the
neighborhood
had
made
Gwendolen
an
offer
,
why
should
Mr.
Grandcourt
be
thought
of
as
likely
to
do
what
they
had
left
undone
?
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
because
he
was
thought
of
as
still
more
eligible
;
since
a
great
deal
of
what
passes
for
likelihood
in
the
world
is
simply
the
reflex
of
a
wish
.
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
,
for
example
,
having
no
anxiety
that
Miss
Harleth
should
make
a
brilliant
marriage
,
had
quite
a
different
likelihood
in
their
minds
.

Brackenshaw
Park
,
where
the
Archery
Meeting
was
held
,
looked
out
from
its
gentle
heights
far
over
the
neighboring
valley
to
the
outlying
eastern
downs
and
the
broad
,
slow
rise
of
cultivated
country
,
hanging
like
a
vast
curtain
toward
the
west
.
<EOS>
The
castle
which
stood
on
the
highest
platform
of
the
clustered
hills
,
was
built
of
rough
-
hewn
limestone
,
full
of
lights
and
shadows
made
by
the
dark
dust
of
lichens
and
the
washings
of
the
rain
.
<EOS>
Masses
of
beech
and
fir
sheltered
it
on
the
north
,
and
spread
down
here
and
there
along
the
green
slopes
like
flocks
seeking
the
water
which
gleamed
below
.
<EOS>
The
archery
-
ground
was
a
carefully
-
kept
enclosure
on
a
bit
of
table
-
land
at
the
farthest
end
of
the
park
,
protected
toward
the
southwest
by
tall
elms
and
a
thick
screen
of
hollies
,
which
kept
the
gravel
walk
and
the
bit
of
newly
-
mown
turf
where
the
targets
were
placed
in
agreeable
afternoon
shade
.
<EOS>
The
Archery
Hall
with
an
arcade
in
front
showed
like
a
white
temple
against
the
greenery
on
the
north
side
.
  
<EOS>
What
could
make
a
better
background
for
the
flower
-
groups
of
ladies
,
moving
and
bowing
and
turning
their
necks
as
it
would
become
the
leisurely
lilies
to
do
if
they
took
to
locomotion
.
<EOS>
The
sounds
too
were
very
pleasant
to
hear
,
even
when
the
military
band
from
Wanchester
ceased
to
play
:
musical
laughs
in
all
the
registers
and
a
harmony
of
happy
,
friendly
speeches
,
now
rising
toward
mild
excitement
,
now
sinking
to
an
agreeable
murmur
.
  
<EOS>
No
open
-
air
amusement
could
be
much
freer
from
those
noisy
,
crowding
conditions
which
spoil
most
modern
pleasures
;
no
Archery
Meeting
could
be
more
select
,
the
number
of
friends
accompanying
the
members
being
restricted
by
an
award
of
tickets
,
so
as
to
keep
the
maximum
within
the
limits
of
convenience
for
the
dinner
and
ball
to
be
held
in
the
castle
.
<EOS>
Within
the
enclosure
no
plebeian
spectators
were
admitted
except
Lord
Brackenshaw
's
tenants
and
their
families
,
and
of
these
it
was
chiefly
the
feminine
members
who
used
the
privilege
,
bringing
their
little
boys
and
girls
or
younger
brothers
and
sisters
.
<EOS>
The
males
among
them
relieved
the
insipidity
of
the
entertainment
by
imaginative
betting
,
in
which
the
stake
was
"
anything
you
like
,
"
on
their
favorite
archers
;
but
the
young
maidens
,
having
a
different
principle
of
discrimination
,
were
considering
which
of
those
sweetly
-
dressed
ladies
they
would
choose
to
be
,
if
the
choice
were
allowed
them
.
<EOS>
Probably
the
form
these
rural
souls
would
most
have
striven
for
as
a
tabernacle
,
was
some
other
than
Gwendolen
's
 
one
with
more
pink
in
her
cheeks
and
hair
of
the
most
fashionable
yellow
;
but
among
the
male
judges
in
the
ranks
immediately
surrounding
her
there
was
unusual
unanimity
in
pronouncing
her
the
finest
girl
present
.
  
<EOS>
No
wonder
she
enjoyed
her
existence
on
that
July
day
.
<EOS>
Pre
-
eminence
is
sweet
to
those
who
love
it
,
even
under
mediocre
circumstances
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
was
not
quite
mythical
that
a
slave
has
been
proud
to
be
bought
first
;
and
probably
a
barn
-
door
fowl
on
sale
,
though
he
may
not
have
understood
himself
to
be
called
the
best
of
a
bad
lot
,
may
have
a
self
-
informed
consciousness
of
his
relative
importance
,
and
strut
consoled
.
<EOS>
But
for
complete
enjoyment
the
outward
and
the
inward
must
concur
.
<EOS>
And
that
concurrence
was
happening
to
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
Who
can
deny
that
bows
and
arrows
are
among
the
prettiest
weapons
in
the
world
for
feminine
forms
to
play
with
?
<EOS>
They
prompt
attitudes
full
of
grace
and
power
,
where
that
fine
concentration
of
energy
seen
in
all
markmanship
,
is
freed
from
associations
of
bloodshed
.
<EOS>
The
time
-
honored
British
resource
of
"
killing
something
"
is
no
longer
carried
on
with
bow
and
quiver
;
bands
defending
their
passes
against
an
invading
nation
fight
under
another
sort
of
shade
than
a
cloud
of
arrows
;
and
poisoned
darts
are
harmless
survivals
either
in
rhetoric
or
in
regions
comfortably
remote
.
<EOS>
Archery
has
no
ugly
smell
of
brimstone
;
breaks
nobody
's
shins
,
breeds
no
athletic
monsters
;
its
only
danger
is
that
of
failing
,
which
for
generous
blood
is
enough
to
mould
skilful
action
.
<EOS>
And
among
the
Brackenshaw
archers
the
prizes
were
all
of
the
nobler
symbolic
kind
;
not
properly
to
be
carried
off
in
a
parcel
,
degrading
honor
into
gain
;
but
the
gold
arrow
and
the
silver
,
the
gold
star
and
the
silver
,
to
be
worn
for
a
long
time
in
sign
of
achievement
and
then
transferred
to
the
next
who
did
excellently
.
<EOS>
These
signs
of
pre
-
eminence
had
the
virtue
of
wreaths
without
their
inconveniences
,
which
might
have
produced
a
melancholy
effect
in
the
heat
of
the
ball
-
room
.
<EOS>
Altogether
the
Brackenshaw
Archery
Club
was
an
institution
framed
with
good
taste
,
so
as
not
to
have
by
necessity
any
ridiculous
incidents
.
  
<EOS>
And
to
-
day
all
incalculable
elements
were
in
its
favor
.
<EOS>
There
was
mild
warmth
,
and
no
wind
to
disturb
either
hair
or
drapery
or
the
course
of
the
arrow
;
all
skillful
preparation
had
fair
play
,
and
when
there
was
a
general
march
to
extract
the
arrows
,
the
promenade
of
joyous
young
creatures
in
light
speech
and
laughter
,
the
graceful
movement
in
common
toward
a
common
object
,
was
a
show
worth
looking
at
.
<EOS>
Here
Gwendolen
seemed
a
Calypso
among
her
nymphs
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
her
attitudes
and
movements
that
every
one
was
obliged
to
admit
her
surpassing
charm
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
girl
is
like
a
high
-
mettled
racer
,
"
said
Lord
Brackenshaw
to
young
Clintock
,
one
of
the
invited
spectators
.
  
<EOS>
"
First
chop
!
<EOS>
tremendously
pretty
too
,
"
said
the
elegant
Grecian
,
who
had
been
paying
her
assiduous
attention
;
"
I
never
saw
her
look
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
she
had
never
looked
so
well
.
<EOS>
Her
face
was
beaming
with
young
pleasure
in
which
there
was
no
malign
rays
of
discontent
;
for
being
satisfied
with
her
own
chances
,
she
felt
kindly
toward
everybody
and
was
satisfied
with
the
universe
.
<EOS>
Not
to
have
the
highest
distinction
in
rank
,
not
to
be
marked
out
as
an
heiress
,
like
Miss
Arrowpoint
,
gave
an
added
triumph
in
eclipsing
those
advantages
.
<EOS>
For
personal
recommendation
she
would
not
have
cared
to
change
the
family
group
accompanying
her
for
any
other
:
her
mamma
's
appearance
would
have
suited
an
amiable
duchess
;
her
uncle
and
aunt
Gascoigne
with
Anna
made
equally
gratifying
figures
in
their
way
;
and
Gwendolen
was
too
full
of
joyous
belief
in
herself
to
feel
in
the
least
jealous
though
Miss
Arrowpoint
was
one
of
the
best
archeresses
.
  
<EOS>
Even
the
reappearance
of
the
formidable
Herr
Klesmer
,
which
caused
some
surprise
in
the
rest
of
the
company
,
seemed
only
to
fall
in
with
Gwendolen
's
inclination
to
be
amused
.
<EOS>
Short
of
Apollo
himself
,
<EOS>
what
great
musical
_
maestro
_
could
make
a
good
figure
at
an
archery
meeting
?
<EOS>
There
was
a
very
satirical
light
in
Gwendolen
's
eyes
as
she
looked
toward
the
Arrowpoint
party
on
their
first
entrance
,
when
the
contrast
between
Klesmer
and
the
average
group
of
English
country
people
seemed
at
its
utmost
intensity
in
the
close
neighborhood
of
his
hosts
 
or
patrons
,
as
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
would
have
liked
to
hear
them
called
,
that
she
might
deny
the
possibility
of
any
longer
patronizing
genius
,
its
royalty
being
universally
acknowledged
.
<EOS>
The
contrast
might
have
amused
a
graver
personage
than
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
We
English
are
a
miscellaneous
people
,
and
any
chance
fifty
of
us
will
present
many
varieties
of
animal
architecture
or
facial
ornament
;
but
it
must
be
admitted
that
our
prevailing
expression
is
not
that
of
a
lively
,
impassioned
race
,
preoccupied
with
the
ideal
and
carrying
the
real
as
a
mere
make
-
weight
.
<EOS>
The
strong
point
of
the
English
gentleman
pure
is
the
easy
style
of
his
figure
and
clothing
;
he
objects
to
marked
ins
and
outs
in
his
costume
,
and
he
also
objects
to
looking
inspired
.
  
<EOS>
Fancy
<EOS>
an
assemblage
where
the
men
had
all
that
ordinary
stamp
of
the
well
-
bred
Englishman
,
watching
the
entrance
of
Herr
Klesmer
 
<EOS>
his
mane
of
hair
floating
backward
in
massive
inconsistency
with
the
chimney
-
pot
hat
,
which
had
the
look
of
having
been
put
on
for
a
joke
above
his
pronounced
but
well
-
modeled
features
and
powerful
clear
-
shaven
mouth
and
chin
;
his
tall
,
thin
figure
clad
in
a
way
which
,
not
being
strictly
English
,
was
all
the
worse
for
its
apparent
emphasis
of
intention
.
<EOS>
Draped
in
a
loose
garment
with
a
Florentine
_
berretta
_
on
his
head
,
he
would
have
been
fit
to
stand
by
the
side
of
Leonardo
de
Vinci
;
but
how
when
he
presented
himself
in
trousers
which
were
not
what
English
feeling
demanded
about
the
knees
?
 
<EOS>
and
when
the
fire
that
showed
itself
in
his
glances
and
the
movements
of
his
head
,
as
he
looked
round
him
with
curiosity
,
was
turned
into
comedy
by
a
hat
which
ruled
that
mankind
should
have
well
-
cropped
hair
and
a
staid
demeanor
,
<EOS>
such
,
for
example
,
as
Mr.
Arrowsmith
's
,
whose
nullity
of
face
and
perfect
tailoring
might
pass
everywhere
without
ridicule
?
<EOS>
One
feels
why
it
is
often
better
for
greatness
to
be
dead
,
and
to
have
got
rid
of
the
outward
man
.
  
<EOS>
Many
present
knew
Klesmer
,
or
knew
of
him
;
but
they
had
only
seen
him
on
candle
-
light
occasions
when
he
appeared
simply
as
a
musician
,
and
he
had
not
yet
that
supreme
,
world
-
wide
celebrity
which
makes
an
artist
great
to
the
most
ordinary
people
by
their
knowledge
of
his
great
expensiveness
.
<EOS>
It
was
literally
a
new
light
for
them
to
see
him
in
 
presented
unexpectedly
on
this
July
afternoon
in
an
exclusive
society
:
some
were
inclined
to
laugh
,
others
felt
a
little
disgust
at
the
want
of
judgment
shown
by
the
Arrowpoints
in
this
use
of
an
introductory
card
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
extreme
guys
those
artistic
fellows
usually
are
?
"
said
young
Clintock
to
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
Do
look
at
the
figure
he
cuts
,
bowing
with
his
hand
on
his
heart
to
Lady
Brackenshaw
 
and
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
's
feather
just
reaching
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
one
of
the
profane
,
"
said
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
blind
to
the
majesty
of
genius
.
<EOS>
Herr
Klesmer
smites
me
with
awe
;
I
feel
crushed
in
his
presence
;
my
courage
all
oozes
from
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
you
understand
all
about
his
music
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
indeed
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
with
a
light
laugh
;
"
it
is
he
who
understands
all
about
mine
and
thinks
it
pitiable
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Klesmer
's
verdict
on
her
singing
had
been
an
easier
joke
to
her
since
he
had
been
struck
by
her
_
plastik
_
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
addressed
to
the
ears
of
the
future
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
I
'm
glad
of
that
:
it
suits
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
are
very
kind
.
<EOS>
But
how
remarkably
well
Miss
Arrowpoint
looks
to
-
day
!
<EOS>
She
would
make
quite
a
fine
picture
in
that
gold
-
colored
dress
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Too
splendid
,
do
n't
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
perhaps
a
little
too
symbolical
 
too
much
like
the
figure
of
Wealth
in
an
allegory
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
speech
of
Gwendolen
's
had
rather
a
malicious
sound
,
but
it
was
not
really
more
than
a
bubble
of
fun
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
wish
Miss
Arrowpoint
or
any
one
else
to
be
out
of
the
way
,
believing
in
her
own
good
fortune
even
more
than
in
her
skill
.
<EOS>
The
belief
in
both
naturally
grew
stronger
as
the
shooting
went
on
,
for
she
promised
to
achieve
one
of
the
best
scores
 
a
success
which
astonished
every
one
in
a
new
member
;
and
to
Gwendolen
's
temperament
one
success
determined
another
.
<EOS>
She
trod
on
air
,
and
all
things
pleasant
seemed
possible
.
<EOS>
The
hour
was
enough
for
her
,
and
she
was
not
obliged
to
think
what
she
should
do
next
to
keep
her
life
at
the
due
pitch
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
does
the
scoring
stand
,
I
wonder
?
"
said
Lady
Brackenshaw
,
a
gracious
personage
who
,
adorned
with
two
little
girls
and
a
boy
of
stout
make
,
sat
as
lady
paramount
.
<EOS>
Her
lord
had
come
up
to
her
in
one
of
the
intervals
of
shooting
.
<EOS>
"
It
seems
to
me
that
Miss
Harleth
is
likely
to
win
the
gold
arrow
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Gad
,
I
think
she
will
,
if
she
carries
it
on
!
<EOS>
she
is
running
Juliet
Fenn
hard
.
<EOS>
It
is
wonderful
for
one
in
her
first
year
.
<EOS>
Catherine
is
not
up
to
her
usual
mark
,
"
continued
his
lordship
,
turning
to
the
heiress
's
mother
who
sat
near
.
"
<EOS>
But
she
got
the
gold
arrow
last
time
.
<EOS>
And
there
's
a
luck
even
in
these
games
of
skill
.
<EOS>
That
's
better
.
<EOS>
It
gives
the
hinder
ones
a
chance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Catherine
will
be
very
glad
for
others
to
win
,
"
said
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
,
"
she
is
so
magnanimous
.
<EOS>
It
was
entirely
her
considerateness
that
made
us
bring
Herr
Klesmer
instead
of
Canon
Stopley
,
who
had
expressed
a
wish
to
come
.
<EOS>
For
her
own
pleasure
,
I
am
sure
she
would
rather
have
brought
the
Canon
;
but
she
is
always
thinking
of
others
.
<EOS>
I
told
her
it
was
not
quite
_
<EOS>
en
règle
_
to
bring
one
so
far
out
of
our
own
set
;
but
she
said
,
"
Genius
itself
is
not
_
en
règle
_
;
it
comes
into
the
world
to
make
new
rules
.
"
<EOS>
And
one
must
admit
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
to
be
sure
,
"
said
Lord
Brackenshaw
,
in
a
tone
of
careless
dismissal
,
adding
quickly
,
"
For
my
part
,
I
am
not
magnanimous
;
I
should
like
to
win
.
<EOS>
But
,
confound
it
!
<EOS>
I
never
have
the
chance
now
.
<EOS>
I
'm
getting
old
and
idle
.
<EOS>
The
young
ones
beat
me
.
<EOS>
As
old
Nestor
says
 
the
gods
do
n't
give
us
everything
at
one
time
:
I
was
a
young
fellow
once
,
and
now
I
am
getting
an
old
and
wise
one
.
<EOS>
Old
,
at
any
rate
;
which
is
a
gift
that
comes
to
everybody
if
they
live
long
enough
,
so
it
raises
no
jealousy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Earl
smiled
comfortably
at
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
lord
,
people
who
have
been
neighbors
twenty
years
must
not
talk
to
each
other
about
age
,
"
said
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Years
,
as
the
Tuscans
say
,
are
made
for
the
letting
of
houses
.
<EOS>
But
where
is
our
new
neighbor
?
<EOS>
I
thought
Mr.
Grandcourt
was
to
be
here
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
by
the
way
,
so
he
was
.
<EOS>
The
time
's
getting
on
too
,
"
said
his
lordship
,
looking
at
his
watch
.
<EOS>
"
But
he
only
got
to
Diplow
the
other
day
.
<EOS>
He
came
to
us
on
Tuesday
and
said
he
had
been
a
little
bothered
.
<EOS>
He
may
have
been
pulled
in
another
direction
.
<EOS>
Why
,
Gascoigne
!
"
 
<EOS>
the
rector
was
just
then
crossing
at
a
little
distance
with
Gwendolen
on
his
arm
,
and
turned
in
compliance
with
the
call
 
<EOS>
"
this
is
a
little
too
bad
;
you
not
only
beat
us
yourself
,
but
you
bring
up
your
niece
to
beat
all
the
archeresses
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
<EOS>
_
is
_
rather
scandalous
in
her
to
get
the
better
of
elder
members
,
"
said
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
with
much
inward
satisfaction
curling
his
short
upper
lip
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
not
my
doing
,
my
lord
.
<EOS>
I
only
meant
her
to
make
a
tolerable
figure
,
without
surpassing
any
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
my
fault
,
either
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
with
pretty
archness
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
am
to
aim
,
I
ca
n't
help
hitting
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
that
may
be
a
fatal
business
for
some
people
,
"
said
Lord
Brackenshaw
,
good
-
humoredly
;
then
taking
out
his
watch
and
looking
at
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
again
 
<EOS>
"
The
time
's
getting
on
,
as
you
say
.
<EOS>
But
Grandcourt
is
always
late
.
<EOS>
I
notice
in
town
he
's
always
late
,
and
he
's
no
bowman
 
<EOS>
understands
nothing
about
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
told
him
he
must
come
;
he
would
see
the
flower
of
the
neighborhood
here
.
<EOS>
He
asked
about
you
 
had
seen
Arrowpoint
's
card
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
had
not
made
his
acquaintance
in
town
.
<EOS>
He
has
been
a
good
deal
abroad
.
<EOS>
People
do
n't
know
him
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
we
are
strangers
,
"
said
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
.
<EOS>
"
But
that
is
not
what
might
have
been
expected
.
<EOS>
For
his
uncle
Sir
Hugo
Mallinger
and
I
are
great
friends
when
we
meet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
;
uncles
and
nephews
are
not
so
likely
to
be
seen
together
as
uncles
and
nieces
,
"
said
his
lordship
,
smiling
toward
the
rector
.
<EOS>
"
But
just
come
with
me
one
instant
,
Gascoigne
,
will
you
?
<EOS>
I
want
to
speak
a
word
about
the
clout
-
shooting
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
chose
to
go
too
and
be
deposited
in
the
same
group
with
her
mamma
and
aunt
until
she
had
to
shoot
again
.
<EOS>
That
Mr.
Grandcourt
might
after
all
not
appear
on
the
archery
-
ground
,
had
begun
to
enter
into
Gwendolen
's
thought
as
a
possible
deduction
from
the
completeness
of
her
pleasure
.
<EOS>
Under
all
her
saucy
satire
,
provoked
chiefly
by
her
divination
that
her
friends
thought
of
him
as
a
desirable
match
for
her
,
she
felt
something
very
far
from
indifference
as
to
the
impression
she
would
make
on
him
.
<EOS>
True
,
he
was
not
to
have
the
slightest
power
over
her
<EOS>
(
for
Gwendolen
had
not
considered
that
the
desire
to
conquer
is
itself
a
sort
of
subjection
)
;
she
had
made
up
her
mind
that
he
was
to
be
one
of
those
complimentary
and
assiduously
admiring
men
of
whom
even
her
narrow
experience
had
shown
her
several
with
various
-
colored
beards
and
various
styles
of
bearing
;
and
the
sense
that
her
friends
would
want
her
to
think
him
delightful
,
gave
her
a
resistant
inclination
to
presuppose
him
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
But
that
was
no
reason
why
she
could
spare
his
presence
:
and
even
a
passing
prevision
of
trouble
in
case
she
despised
and
refused
him
,
raised
not
the
shadow
of
a
wish
that
he
should
save
her
that
trouble
by
showing
no
disposition
to
make
her
an
offer
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grandcourt
taking
hardly
any
notice
of
her
,
and
becoming
shortly
engaged
to
Miss
Arrowpoint
,
was
not
a
picture
which
flattered
her
imagination
.
  
<EOS>
Hence
Gwendolen
had
been
all
ear
to
Lord
Brackenshaw
's
mode
of
accounting
for
Grandcourt
's
non
-
appearance
;
and
when
he
did
arrive
,
no
consciousness
 
not
even
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
's
or
Mr.
Gascoigne
's
 
was
more
awake
to
the
fact
than
hers
,
although
she
steadily
avoided
looking
toward
any
point
where
he
was
likely
to
be
.
<EOS>
There
should
be
no
slightest
shifting
of
angles
to
betray
that
it
was
of
any
consequence
to
her
whether
the
much
-
talked
-
of
<EOS>
Mr.
Mallinger
Grandcourt
presented
himself
or
not
.
<EOS>
She
became
again
absorbed
in
the
shooting
,
and
so
resolutely
abstained
from
looking
round
observantly
that
,
even
supposing
him
to
have
taken
a
conspicuous
place
among
the
spectators
<EOS>
,
it
might
be
clear
she
was
not
aware
of
him
.
<EOS>
And
all
the
while
the
certainty
that
he
was
there
made
a
distinct
thread
in
her
consciousness
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
her
shooting
was
the
better
for
it
:
at
any
rate
,
it
gained
in
precision
,
and
she
at
last
raised
a
delightful
storm
of
clapping
and
applause
by
three
hits
running
in
the
gold
 
<EOS>
a
feat
which
among
the
Brackenshaw
archers
had
not
the
vulgar
reward
of
a
shilling
poll
-
tax
,
but
that
of
a
special
gold
star
to
be
worn
on
the
breast
.
<EOS>
That
moment
was
not
only
a
happy
one
to
herself
 
<EOS>
it
was
just
what
her
mamma
and
her
uncle
would
have
chosen
for
her
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
general
falling
into
ranks
to
give
her
space
that
she
might
advance
conspicuously
to
receive
the
gold
star
from
the
hands
of
Lady
Brackenshaw
;
and
the
perfect
movement
of
her
fine
form
was
certainly
a
pleasant
thing
to
behold
in
the
clear
afternoon
light
when
the
shadows
were
long
and
still
.
<EOS>
She
was
the
central
object
of
that
pretty
picture
,
and
every
one
present
must
gaze
at
her
.
<EOS>
That
was
enough
:
she
herself
was
determined
to
see
nobody
in
particular
,
or
to
turn
her
eyes
any
way
except
toward
Lady
Brackenshaw
,
but
her
thoughts
undeniably
turned
in
other
ways
.
<EOS>
It
entered
a
little
into
her
pleasure
that
Herr
Klesmer
must
be
observing
her
at
a
moment
when
music
was
out
of
the
question
,
and
his
superiority
very
far
in
the
back
-
ground
;
for
vanity
is
as
ill
at
ease
under
indifference
as
tenderness
is
under
a
love
which
it
can
not
return
;
and
the
unconquered
Klesmer
threw
a
trace
of
his
malign
power
even
across
her
pleasant
consciousness
that
Mr.
Grandcourt
was
seeing
her
to
the
utmost
advantage
,
and
was
probably
giving
her
an
admiration
unmixed
with
criticism
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
expect
to
admire
_
him
_
,
but
that
was
not
necessary
to
her
peace
of
mind
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
met
Lady
Brackenshaw
's
gracious
smile
without
blushing
(
which
only
came
to
her
when
she
was
taken
by
surprise
)
,
but
with
a
charming
gladness
of
expression
,
and
then
bent
with
easy
grace
to
have
the
star
fixed
near
her
shoulder
.
<EOS>
That
little
ceremony
had
been
over
long
enough
for
her
to
have
exchanged
playful
speeches
and
received
congratulations
as
she
moved
among
the
groups
who
were
now
interesting
themselves
in
the
results
of
the
scoring
;
but
it
happened
that
she
stood
outside
examining
the
point
of
an
arrow
with
rather
an
absent
air
when
Lord
Brackenshaw
came
up
to
her
and
said
:
  
"
Miss
Harleth
,
here
is
a
gentleman
who
is
not
willing
to
wait
any
longer
for
an
introduction

<EOS>
He
has
been
getting
Mrs.
Davilow
to
send
me
with
him
.
<EOS>
Will
you
allow
me
to
introduce
Mr.
Mallinger
Grandcourt
?

The
beginning
of
an
acquaintance
whether
with
persons
or
things
is
to
    
get
a
definite
outline
for
our
ignorance
.
   
<EOS>
Mr.
Grandcourt
's
wish
to
be
introduced
had
no
suddenness
for
Gwendolen
;
but
when
Lord
Brackenshaw
moved
aside
a
little
for
the
prefigured
stranger
to
come
forward
<EOS>
and
she
felt
herself
face
to
face
with
the
real
man
<EOS>
,
there
was
a
little
shock
which
flushed
her
cheeks
and
vexatiously
deepened
with
her
consciousness
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
shock
came
from
the
reversal
of
her
expectations
:
Grandcourt
could
hardly
have
been
more
unlike
all
her
imaginary
portraits
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
slightly
taller
than
herself
,
and
their
eyes
seemed
to
be
on
a
level
;
there
was
not
the
faintest
smile
on
his
face
as
he
looked
at
her
,
not
a
trace
of
self
-
consciousness
or
anxiety
in
his
bearing
:
when
he
raised
his
hat
he
showed
an
extensive
baldness
surrounded
with
a
mere
fringe
of
reddish
-
blonde
hair
,
but
he
also
showed
a
perfect
hand
;
the
line
of
feature
from
brow
to
chin
undisguised
by
beard
was
decidedly
handsome
,
with
only
moderate
departures
from
the
perpendicular
,
and
the
slight
whisker
too
was
perpendicular
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
possible
for
a
human
aspect
to
be
freer
from
grimace
or
solicitous
wrigglings
:
also
it
was
perhaps
not
possible
for
a
breathing
man
wide
awake
to
look
less
animated
.
<EOS>
The
correct
Englishman
,
drawing
himself
up
from
his
bow
into
rigidity
,
assenting
severely
,
and
seemed
to
be
in
a
state
of
internal
drill
,
suggests
a
suppressed
vivacity
,
and
may
be
suspected
of
letting
go
with
some
violence
when
he
is
released
from
parade
;
but
Grandcourt
's
bearing
had
no
rigidity
,
it
inclined
rather
to
the
flaccid
.
<EOS>
His
complexion
had
a
faded
fairness
resembling
that
of
an
actress
when
bare
of
the
artificial
white
and
red
;
his
long
narrow
gray
eyes
expressed
nothing
but
indifference
.
<EOS>
Attempts
at
description
are
stupid
:
who
can
all
at
once
describe
a
human
being
?
<EOS>
even
when
he
is
presented
to
us
we
only
begin
that
knowledge
of
his
appearance
which
must
be
completed
by
innumerable
impressions
under
differing
circumstances
.
<EOS>
We
recognize
the
alphabet
;
we
are
not
sure
of
the
language
.
<EOS>
I
am
only
mentioning
the
point
that
Gwendolen
saw
by
the
light
of
a
prepared
contrast
in
the
first
minutes
of
her
meeting
with
Grandcourt
:
they
were
summed
up
in
the
words
,
"
He
is
not
ridiculous
.
"
<EOS>
But
forthwith
Lord
Brackenshaw
was
gone
,
and
what
is
called
conversation
had
begun
,
the
first
and
constant
element
in
it
being
that
Grandcourt
looked
at
Gwendolen
persistently
with
a
slightly
exploring
gaze
,
but
without
change
of
expression
,
while
she
only
occasionally
looked
at
him
with
a
flash
of
observation
a
little
softened
by
coquetry
.
<EOS>
Also
,
after
her
answers
there
was
a
longer
or
shorter
pause
before
he
spoke
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
used
to
think
archery
was
a
great
bore
,
"
Grandcourt
began
.
<EOS>
He
spoke
with
a
fine
accent
,
but
with
a
certain
broken
drawl
,
as
of
a
distinguished
personage
with
a
distinguished
cold
on
his
chest
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
converted
to
-
day
?
"
said
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
(
Pause
,
during
which
she
imagined
various
degrees
and
modes
of
opinion
about
herself
that
might
be
entertained
by
Grandcourt
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
since
I
saw
you
shooting
.
<EOS>
In
things
of
this
sort
one
generally
sees
people
missing
and
simpering
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
are
a
first
-
rate
shot
with
a
rifle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
(
Pause
,
during
which
Gwendolen
,
having
taken
a
rapid
observation
of
Grandcourt
,
made
a
brief
graphic
description
of
him
to
an
indefinite
hearer
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
left
off
shooting
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
then
you
are
a
formidable
person
.
<EOS>
People
who
have
done
things
once
and
left
them
off
make
one
feel
very
contemptible
,
as
if
one
were
using
cast
-
off
fashions
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
have
not
left
off
all
follies
,
because
I
practice
a
great
many
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
(
Pause
,
during
which
Gwendolen
made
several
interpretations
of
her
own
speech
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
call
follies
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
in
general
I
think
,
whatever
is
agreeable
is
called
a
folly
.
<EOS>
But
you
have
not
left
off
hunting
,
I
hear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
(
Pause
,
wherein
Gwendolen
recalled
what
she
had
heard
about
Grandcourt
's
position
,
and
decided
that
he
was
the
most
aristocratic
-
looking
man
she
had
ever
seen
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
One
must
do
something
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
do
you
care
about
the
turf
?
 
<EOS>
or
is
that
among
the
things
you
have
left
off
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
(
Pause
,
during
which
Gwendolen
thought
that
a
man
of
extremely
calm
,
cold
manners
might
be
less
disagreeable
as
a
husband
than
other
men
,
and
not
likely
to
interfere
with
his
wife
's
preferences
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
I
run
a
horse
now
and
then
;
but
I
do
n't
go
in
for
the
thing
as
some
men
do
.
<EOS>
Are
you
fond
of
horses
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
indeed
:
I
never
like
my
life
so
well
as
when
I
am
on
horseback
,
having
a
great
gallop
.
<EOS>
I
think
of
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
only
feel
myself
strong
and
happy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
(
Pause
,
wherein
Gwendolen
wondered
whether
Grandcourt
would
like
what
she
said
,
but
assured
herself
that
she
was
not
going
to
disguise
her
tastes
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
like
danger
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
When
I
am
on
horseback
I
never
think
of
danger
.
<EOS>
It
seems
to
me
that
if
I
broke
my
bones
I
should
not
feel
it
.
<EOS>
I
should
go
at
anything
that
came
in
my
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
(
Pause
during
which
Gwendolen
had
run
through
a
whole
hunting
season
with
two
chosen
hunters
to
ride
at
will
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
perhaps
like
tiger
-
hunting
or
pig
-
sticking
.
<EOS>
I
saw
some
of
that
for
a
season
or
two
in
the
East
.
<EOS>
Everything
here
is
poor
stuff
after
that
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
_
You
_
are
fond
of
danger
,
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
(
Pause
,
wherein
Gwendolen
speculated
on
the
probability
that
the
men
of
coldest
manners
were
the
most
adventurous
,
and
felt
the
strength
of
her
own
insight
,
supposing
the
question
had
to
be
decided
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
One
must
have
something
or
other
.
<EOS>
But
one
gets
used
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
think
I
am
very
fortunate
,
because
everything
is
new
to
me
:
it
is
only
that
I
ca
n't
get
enough
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
used
to
anything
except
being
dull
,
which
I
should
like
to
leave
off
as
you
have
left
off
shooting
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
(
Pause
,
during
which
it
occurred
to
Gwendolen
that
a
man
of
cold
and
distinguished
manners
might
possibly
be
a
dull
companion
;
but
on
the
other
hand
she
thought
that
most
persons
were
dull
,
that
she
had
not
observed
husbands
to
be
companions
 
and
that
after
all
she
was
not
going
to
accept
Grandcourt
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
Why
are
you
dull
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
dreadful
neighborhood
.
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
to
be
done
in
it
.
<EOS>
That
is
why
I
practiced
my
archery
.
"
  
<EOS>
(
Pause
,
during
which
Gwendolen
reflected
that
the
life
of
an
unmarried
woman
who
could
not
go
about
and
had
no
command
of
anything
must
necessarily
be
dull
through
all
degrees
of
comparison
as
time
went
on
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
made
yourself
queen
of
it

I
imagine
you
will
carry
the
first
prize
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
.
<EOS>
I
have
great
rivals

<EOS>
Did
you
not
observe
how
well
Miss
Arrowpoint
shot
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
(
Pause
,
wherein
Gwendolen
was
thinking
that
men
had
been
known
to
choose
some
one
else
than
the
woman
they
most
admired
,
and
recalled
several
experiences
of
that
kind
in
novels
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Arrowpoint
.
<EOS>
No
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
yes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
we
go
now
and
hear
what
the
scoring
says
?
<EOS>
Every
one
is
going
to
the
other
end
now
 
shall
we
join
them
?
<EOS>
I
think
my
uncle
is
looking
toward
me
.
<EOS>
He
perhaps
wants
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
found
a
relief
for
herself
by
thus
changing
the
situation
:
not
that
the
_
tete
-
à
-
tete
_
was
quite
disagreeable
to
her
;
but
while
it
lasted
she
apparently
could
not
get
rid
of
the
unwonted
flush
in
her
cheeks
and
the
sense
of
surprise
which
made
her
feel
less
mistress
of
herself
than
usual
.
<EOS>
And
this
Mr.
Grandcourt
,
who
seemed
to
feel
his
own
importance
more
than
he
did
hers
 
<EOS>
a
sort
of
unreasonableness
few
of
us
can
tolerate
 
must
not
take
for
granted
that
he
was
of
great
moment
to
her
,
or
that
because
others
speculated
on
him
as
a
desirable
match
she
held
herself
altogether
at
his
beck
.
<EOS>
How
Grandcourt
had
filled
up
the
pauses
will
be
more
evident
hereafter
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
just
missed
the
gold
arrow
,
Gwendolen
,
"
said
Mr.
Gascoigne
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Miss
Juliet
Fenn
scores
eight
above
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
glad
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
felt
that
I
was
making
myself
too
disagreeable
 
taking
the
best
of
everything
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
quite
easily
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
be
jealous
of
Juliet
Fenn
,
a
girl
as
middling
as
mid
-
day
market
in
everything
but
her
archery
and
plainness
,
in
which
last
<EOS>
she
was
noticeable
like
her
father
:
<EOS>
underhung
and
with
receding
brow
resembling
that
of
the
more
intelligent
fishes
.
<EOS>
(
Surely
,
considering
the
importance
which
is
given
to
such
an
accident
in
female
offspring
,
marriageable
men
,
or
what
the
new
English
calls
"
intending
bridegrooms
,
"
should
look
at
themselves
dispassionately
in
the
glass
,
since
their
natural
selection
of
a
mate
prettier
than
themselves
is
not
certain
to
bar
the
effect
of
their
own
ugliness
.
)
  
<EOS>
There
was
now
a
lively
movement
in
the
mingling
groups
,
which
carried
the
talk
along
with
it
.
<EOS>
Every
one
spoke
to
every
one
else
by
turns
,
and
Gwendolen
,
who
chose
to
see
what
was
going
on
around
her
now
,
observed
that
Grandcourt
was
having
Klesmer
presented
to
him
by
some
one
unknown
to
her
 
a
middle
-
aged
man
,
with
dark
,
full
face
and
fat
hands
,
who
seemed
to
be
on
the
easiest
terms
with
both
,
and
presently
led
the
way
in
joining
the
Arrowpoints
,
whose
acquaintance
had
already
been
made
by
both
him
and
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
Who
this
stranger
was
she
did
not
care
much
to
know
;
but
she
wished
to
observe
what
was
Grandcourt
's
manner
toward
others
than
herself
.
<EOS>
Precisely
the
same
:
except
that
he
did
not
look
much
at
Miss
Arrowpoint
,
but
rather
at
Klesmer
,
who
was
speaking
with
animation
 
now
stretching
out
his
long
fingers
horizontally
,
now
pointing
downward
with
his
fore
-
finger
,
now
folding
his
arms
and
tossing
his
mane
,
while
he
addressed
himself
first
to
one
and
then
to
the
other
,
including
Grandcourt
,
who
listened
with
an
impassive
face
and
narrow
eyes
,
his
left
fore
-
finger
in
his
waistcoat
-
pocket
,
and
his
right
slightly
touching
his
thin
whisker
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
which
style
Miss
Arrowpoint
admires
most
,
"
was
a
thought
that
glanced
through
Gwendolen
's
mind
,
while
her
eyes
and
lips
gathered
rather
a
mocking
expression
.
<EOS>
But
she
would
not
indulge
her
sense
of
amusement
by
watching
,
as
if
she
were
curious
,
and
she
gave
all
her
animation
to
those
immediately
around
her
,
determined
not
to
care
whether
Mr.
Grandcourt
came
near
her
again
or
not
.
  
<EOS>
He
did
not
come
,
however
,
and
at
a
moment
when
he
could
propose
to
conduct
Mrs.
Davilow
to
her
carriage
,
"
Shall
we
meet
again
in
the
ball
-
room
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
as
he
raised
his
hat
at
parting
.
<EOS>
The
"
yes
"
in
reply
had
the
usual
slight
drawl
and
perfect
gravity
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
were
wrong
for
once
Gwendolen
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
during
their
few
minutes
'
drive
to
the
castle
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
what
,
mamma
?
"
  
"
About
Mr.
Grandcourt
's
appearance
and
manners
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
find
anything
ridiculous
in
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
could
if
I
tried
,
but
I
do
n't
want
to
do
it
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
rather
pettishly
;
and
her
mother
was
afraid
to
say
more
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
rule
on
these
occasions
for
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
to
dine
apart
,
so
that
the
dinner
might
make
a
time
of
comparative
ease
and
rest
for
both
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
gentlemen
had
a
set
of
archery
stories
about
the
epicurism
of
the
ladies
,
who
had
somehow
been
reported
to
show
a
revolting
masculine
judgment
in
venison
,
even
asking
for
the
fat
 
a
proof
of
the
frightful
rate
at
which
corruption
might
go
on
in
women
,
but
for
severe
social
restraint
,
and
every
year
the
amiable
Lord
Brackenshaw
,
who
was
something
of
a
_
gourmet
_
,
mentioned
Byron
's
opinion
that
a
woman
should
never
be
seen
eating
,
 
introducing
it
with
a
confidential
 
<EOS>
"
The
fact
is
"
as
if
he
were
for
the
first
time
admitting
his
concurrence
in
that
sentiment
of
the
refined
poet
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
ladies
'
dining
-
room
it
was
evident
that
Gwendolen
was
not
a
general
favorite
with
her
own
sex
:
there
were
no
beginnings
of
intimacy
between
her
and
other
girls
,
and
in
conversation
they
rather
noticed
what
she
said
than
spoke
to
her
in
free
exchange
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
was
that
she
was
not
much
interested
in
them
,
and
when
left
alone
in
their
company
had
a
sense
of
empty
benches
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Vulcany
once
remarked
that
Miss
Harleth
was
too
fond
of
the
gentlemen
;
but
we
know
that
she
was
not
in
the
least
fond
of
them
 
<EOS>
she
was
only
fond
of
their
homage
 
and
women
did
not
give
her
homage
.
<EOS>
The
exception
to
this
willing
aloofness
from
her
was
Miss
Arrowpoint
,
who
often
managed
unostentatiously
to
be
by
her
side
,
and
talked
to
her
with
quiet
friendliness
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
knows
,
as
I
do
,
that
our
friends
are
ready
to
quarrel
over
a
husband
for
us
,
"
thought
Gwendolen
,
"
and
she
is
determined
not
to
enter
into
the
quarrel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
Miss
Arrowpoint
has
the
best
manners
I
ever
saw
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
when
she
and
Gwendolen
were
in
a
dressing
-
room
with
Mrs.
Gascoigne
and
Anna
,
but
at
a
distance
where
they
could
have
their
talk
apart
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
were
like
her
,
"
said
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
<EOS>
Are
you
getting
discontented
with
yourself
,
Gwen
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
but
I
am
discontented
with
things
.
<EOS>
She
seems
contented
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
you
ought
to
be
satisfied
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
You
must
have
enjoyed
the
shooting
.
<EOS>
I
saw
you
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
that
is
over
now
,
and
I
do
n't
know
what
will
come
next
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
stretching
herself
with
a
sort
of
moan
and
throwing
up
her
arms
.
<EOS>
They
were
bare
now
;
it
was
the
fashion
to
dance
in
the
archery
dress
,
throwing
off
the
jacket
;
and
the
simplicity
of
her
white
cashmere
with
its
border
of
pale
green
set
off
her
form
to
the
utmost
.
<EOS>
A
thin
line
of
gold
round
her
neck
,
and
the
gold
star
on
her
breast
,
were
her
only
ornaments
.
<EOS>
Her
smooth
soft
hair
piled
up
into
a
grand
crown
made
a
clear
line
about
her
brow
.
<EOS>
Sir
Joshua
would
have
been
glad
to
take
her
portrait
;
and
he
would
have
had
an
easier
task
than
the
historian
at
least
in
this
,
that
he
would
not
have
had
to
represent
the
truth
of
change
 
only
to
give
stability
to
one
beautiful
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
dancing
will
come
next
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
<EOS>
"
You
are
sure
to
enjoy
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
only
dance
in
the
quadrille
.
<EOS>
I
told
Mr.
Clintock
so
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
waltz
or
polk
with
any
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
in
the
world
do
you
say
that
all
on
a
sudden
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
bear
having
ugly
people
so
near
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whom
do
you
mean
by
ugly
people
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
plenty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Clintock
,
for
example
,
is
not
ugly
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
dared
not
mention
Grandcourt
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
hate
woolen
cloth
touching
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Fancy
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
to
her
sister
who
now
came
up
from
the
other
end
of
the
room
.
"
<EOS>
Gwendolen
says
she
will
not
waltz
or
polk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
rather
given
to
whims
,
I
think
,
"
said
Mrs.
Gascoigne
,
gravely
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
more
becoming
in
her
to
behave
as
other
young
ladies
do
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
;
especially
when
she
has
had
the
advantage
of
first
-
rate
dancing
lessons
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
I
dance
if
I
do
n't
like
it
,
aunt
?
<EOS>
It
is
not
in
the
catechism
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
_
dear
_
!
"
said
Mrs.
Gascoigne
,
in
a
tone
of
severe
check
,
and
Anna
looked
frightened
at
Gwendolen
's
daring
.
<EOS>
But
they
all
passed
on
without
saying
any
more
.
  
<EOS>
Apparently
something
had
changed
Gwendolen
's
mood
since
the
hour
of
exulting
enjoyment
in
the
archery
-
ground
.
<EOS>
But
she
did
not
look
the
worse
under
the
chandeliers
in
the
ball
-
room
,
where
the
soft
splendor
of
the
scene
and
the
pleasant
odors
from
the
conservatory
could
not
but
be
soothing
to
the
temper
,
when
accompanied
with
the
consciousness
of
being
preeminently
sought
for
.
<EOS>
Hardly
a
dancing
man
but
was
anxious
to
have
her
for
a
partner
,
and
each
whom
she
accepted
was
in
a
state
of
melancholy
remonstrance
that
she
would
not
waltz
or
polk
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
under
a
vow
,
Miss
Harleth
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
are
you
so
cruel
to
us
all
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
waltzed
with
me
in
February
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
who
waltz
so
perfectly
!
"
were
exclamations
not
without
piquancy
for
her
.
<EOS>
The
ladies
who
waltzed
naturally
thought
that
Miss
Harleth
only
wanted
to
make
herself
particular
;
but
her
uncle
when
he
overheard
her
refusal
supported
her
by
saying
    
<EOS>
"
Gwendolen
has
usually
good
reasons
.
"
<EOS>
He
thought
she
was
certainly
more
distinguished
in
not
waltzing
,
and
he
wished
her
to
be
distinguished
.
<EOS>
The
archery
ball
was
intended
to
be
kept
at
the
subdued
pitch
that
suited
all
dignities
clerical
and
secular
;
it
was
not
an
escapement
for
youthful
high
spirits
,
and
he
himself
was
of
opinion
that
the
fashionable
dances
were
too
much
of
a
romp
.
  
<EOS>
Among
the
remonstrant
dancing
men
,
however
,
Mr.
Grandcourt
was
not
numbered
.
<EOS>
After
standing
up
for
a
quadrille
with
Miss
Arrowpoint
,
it
seemed
that
he
meant
to
ask
for
no
other
partner
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
observed
him
frequently
with
the
Arrowpoints
,
but
he
never
took
an
opportunity
of
approaching
her
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
was
sometimes
speaking
to
him
;
but
Mr.
Gascoigne
was
everywhere
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
her
mind
now
that
she
would
probably
after
all
not
have
the
least
trouble
about
him
:
perhaps
he
had
looked
at
her
without
any
particular
admiration
,
and
was
too
much
used
to
everything
in
the
world
to
think
of
her
as
more
than
one
of
the
girls
who
were
invited
in
that
part
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
Of
course
!
<EOS>
It
was
ridiculous
of
elders
to
entertain
notions
about
what
a
man
would
do
,
without
having
seen
him
even
through
a
telescope
.
<EOS>
Probably
he
meant
to
marry
Miss
Arrowpoint
.
<EOS>
Whatever
might
come
,
she
,
Gwendolen
,
was
not
going
to
be
disappointed
:
the
affair
was
a
joke
whichever
way
it
turned
,
for
she
had
never
committed
herself
even
by
a
silent
confidence
in
anything
Mr.
Grandcourt
would
do
.
<EOS>
Still
,
she
noticed
that
he
did
sometimes
quietly
and
gradually
change
his
position
according
to
hers
,
so
that
he
could
see
her
whenever
she
was
dancing
,
and
if
he
did
not
admire
her
 
so
much
the
worse
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
This
movement
for
the
sake
of
being
in
sight
of
her
was
more
direct
than
usual
rather
late
in
the
evening
,
when
Gwendolen
had
accepted
Klesmer
as
a
partner
;
and
that
wide
-
glancing
personage
,
who
saw
everything
and
nothing
by
turns
,
said
to
her
when
they
were
walking
,
"
Mr.
Grandcourt
is
a
man
of
taste
.
<EOS>
He
likes
to
see
you
dancing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
he
likes
to
look
at
what
is
against
his
taste
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
with
a
light
laugh
<EOS>
;
she
was
quite
courageous
with
Klesmer
now
.
"
<EOS>
He
may
be
so
tired
of
admiring
that
he
likes
disgust
for
variety
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Those
words
are
not
suitable
to
your
lips
,
"
said
Klesmer
,
quickly
,
with
one
of
his
grand
frowns
,
while
he
shook
his
hand
as
if
to
banish
the
discordant
sounds
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
as
critical
of
words
as
of
music
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
I
am
.
<EOS>
I
should
require
your
words
to
be
what
your
face
and
form
are
 
always
among
the
meanings
of
a
noble
music
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
a
compliment
as
well
as
a
correction
.
<EOS>
I
am
obliged
for
both
.
<EOS>
But
do
you
know
I
am
bold
enough
to
wish
to
correct
_
you
_
,
and
require
you
to
understand
a
joke
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
One
may
understand
jokes
without
liking
them
,
"
said
the
terrible
Klesmer
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
had
opera
books
sent
me
full
of
jokes
;
it
was
just
because
I
understood
them
that
I
did
not
like
them
.
<EOS>
The
comic
people
are
ready
to
challenge
a
man
because
he
looks
grave
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
see
the
witticism
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
but
I
see
what
you
meant
.
<EOS>
"
Then
I
am
what
we
call
ticketed
as
a
fellow
without
_
esprit
_
.
<EOS>
But
,
in
fact
,
"
said
Klesmer
,
suddenly
dropping
from
his
quick
narrative
to
a
reflective
tone
,
with
an
impressive
frown
,
"
I
am
very
sensible
to
wit
and
humor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
you
tell
me
that
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
not
without
some
wickedness
of
intention
.
<EOS>
But
Klesmer
's
thoughts
had
flown
off
on
the
wings
of
his
own
statement
,
as
their
habit
was
,
and
she
had
the
wickedness
all
to
herself
.
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
who
is
that
standing
near
the
card
-
room
door
?
<EOS>
"
she
went
on
,
seeing
there
the
same
stranger
with
whom
Klesmer
had
been
in
animated
talk
on
the
archery
ground
.
"
<EOS>
He
is
a
friend
of
yours
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
;
an
amateur
I
have
seen
in
town
;
Lush
,
a
Mr.
Lush
 
too
fond
of
Meyerbeer
and
Scribe
 
too
fond
of
the
mechanical
-
dramatic
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thanks
.
<EOS>
I
wanted
to
know
whether
you
thought
his
face
and
form
required
that
his
words
should
be
among
the
meanings
of
noble
music
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Klesmer
was
conquered
,
and
flashed
at
her
a
delightful
smile
which
made
them
quite
friendly
until
she
begged
to
be
deposited
by
the
side
of
her
mamma
.
  
<EOS>
Three
minutes
afterward
her
preparations
for
Grandcourt
's
indifference
were
all
canceled
.
<EOS>
Turning
her
head
after
some
remark
to
her
mother
,
she
found
that
he
had
made
his
way
up
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
if
you
are
tired
of
dancing
,
Miss
Harleth
?
"
<EOS>
he
began
,
looking
down
with
his
former
unperturbed
expression
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
do
me
the
honor
 
<EOS>
the
next
 
or
another
quadrille
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
been
very
happy
,
"
said
Gwendolen
looking
at
her
card
,
"
but
I
am
engaged
for
the
next
to
Mr.
Clintock
 
<EOS>
and
indeed
I
perceive
that
I
am
doomed
for
every
quadrille
;
I
have
not
one
to
dispose
of
.
<EOS>
"
She
was
not
sorry
to
punish
Mr.
Grandcourt
's
tardiness
,
yet
at
the
same
time
she
would
have
liked
to
dance
with
him
.
<EOS>
She
gave
him
a
charming
smile
as
she
looked
up
to
deliver
her
answer
,
and
he
stood
still
looking
down
at
her
with
no
smile
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
unfortunate
in
being
too
late
,
"
he
said
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
seemed
to
me
that
you
did
not
care
for
dancing
,
"
said
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
it
might
be
one
of
the
things
you
had
left
off
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
but
I
have
not
begun
to
dance
with
you
,
"
said
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
Always
there
was
the
same
pause
before
he
took
up
his
cue
.
<EOS>
"
You
make
dancing
a
new
thing
,
as
you
make
archery
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
novelty
always
agreeable
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
 
not
always
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
do
n't
know
whether
to
feel
flattered
or
not
.
<EOS>
When
you
had
once
danced
with
me
there
would
be
no
more
novelty
in
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
the
contrary
,
there
would
probably
be
much
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
deep
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
understand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
difficult
to
make
Miss
Harleth
understand
her
power
?
"
<EOS>
Here
Grandcourt
had
turned
to
Mrs.
Davilow
,
who
,
smiling
gently
at
her
daughter
,
said
    
"
I
think
she
does
not
generally
strike
people
as
slow
to
understand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mamma
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
in
a
deprecating
tone
,
"
I
am
adorably
stupid
,
and
want
everything
explained
to
me
 
when
the
meaning
is
pleasant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
stupid
,
I
admit
that
stupidity
is
adorable
,
"
returned
Grandcourt
,
after
the
usual
pause
,
and
without
change
of
tone
.
<EOS>
But
clearly
he
knew
what
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
think
that
my
cavalier
has
forgotten
me
,
"
Gwendolen
observed
after
a
little
while
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
the
quadrille
is
being
formed
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
deserves
to
be
renounced
,
"
said
Grandcourt
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
is
very
pardonable
,
"
said
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
must
have
been
some
misunderstanding
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Clintock
was
too
anxious
about
the
engagement
to
have
forgotten
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
now
Lady
Brackenshaw
came
up
and
said
,
"
Miss
Harleth
,
Mr.
Clintock
has
charged
me
to
express
to
you
his
deep
regret
that
he
was
obliged
to
leave
without
having
the
pleasure
of
dancing
with
you
again
.
<EOS>
An
express
came
from
his
father
,
the
archdeacon
;
something
important
;
he
was
to
go
.
<EOS>
He
was
_
<EOS>
au
désespoir
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
he
was
very
good
to
remember
the
engagement
under
the
circumstances
,
"
said
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
he
was
called
away
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
easy
to
be
politely
sorrowful
on
so
felicitous
an
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
can
profit
by
Mr.
Clintock
's
misfortune
?
"
said
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
"
May
I
hope
that
you
will
let
me
take
his
place
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
very
happy
to
dance
the
next
quadrille
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
appropriateness
of
the
event
seemed
an
augury
,
and
as
Gwendolen
stood
up
for
the
quadrille
with
Grandcourt
,
there
was
a
revival
in
her
of
the
exultation
 
<EOS>
the
sense
of
carrying
everything
before
her
,
which
she
had
felt
earlier
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
No
man
could
have
walked
through
the
quadrille
with
more
irreproachable
ease
than
Grandcourt
;
and
the
absence
of
all
eagerness
in
his
attention
to
her
suited
his
partner
's
taste
.
<EOS>
She
was
now
convinced
that
he
meant
to
distinguish
her
,
to
mark
his
admiration
of
her
in
a
noticeable
way
;
and
it
began
to
appear
probable
that
she
would
have
it
in
her
power
to
reject
him
,
whence
there
was
a
pleasure
in
reckoning
up
the
advantages
which
would
make
her
rejection
splendid
,
and
in
giving
Mr.
Grandcourt
his
utmost
value
.
<EOS>
It
was
also
agreeable
to
divine
that
this
exclusive
selection
of
her
to
dance
with
,
from
among
all
the
unmarried
ladies
present
,
would
attract
observation
;
though
she
studiously
avoided
seeing
this
,
and
at
the
end
of
the
quadrille
walked
away
on
Grandcourt
's
arm
as
if
she
had
been
one
of
the
shortest
sighted
instead
of
the
longest
and
widest
sighted
of
mortals
.
<EOS>
They
encountered
Miss
Arrowpoint
,
who
was
standing
with
Lady
Brackenshaw
and
a
group
of
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
The
heiress
looked
at
Gwendolen
invitingly
and
said
,
"
I
hope
you
will
vote
with
us
,
Miss
Harleth
,
and
Mr.
Grandcourt
too
,
though
he
is
not
an
archer
.
"
<EOS>
Gwendolen
and
Grandcourt
paused
to
join
the
group
,
and
found
that
the
voting
turned
on
the
project
of
a
picnic
archery
meeting
to
be
held
in
Cardell
Chase
,
where
the
evening
entertainment
would
be
more
poetic
than
a
ball
under
,
chandeliers
 
a
feast
of
sunset
lights
along
the
glades
and
through
the
branches
and
over
the
solemn
tree
-
tops
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
thought
the
scheme
delightful
 
equal
to
playing
Robin
Hood
and
Maid
Marian
:
and
Mr.
Grandcourt
,
when
appealed
to
a
second
time
,
said
it
was
a
thing
to
be
done
;
whereupon
Mr.
Lush
,
who
stood
behind
Lady
Brackenshaw
's
elbow
,
drew
Gwendolen
's
notice
by
saying
with
a
familiar
look
and
tone
to
Grandcourt
,
"
Diplow
would
be
a
good
place
for
the
meeting
,
and
more
convenient
:
there
's
a
fine
bit
between
the
oaks
toward
the
north
gate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Impossible
to
look
more
unconscious
of
being
addressed
than
Grandcourt
;
but
Gwendolen
took
a
new
survey
of
the
speaker
,
deciding
,
first
,
that
he
must
be
on
terms
of
intimacy
with
the
tenant
of
Diplow
,
and
,
secondly
,
that
she
would
never
,
if
she
could
help
it
,
let
him
come
within
a
yard
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
subject
to
physical
antipathies
,
and
Mr.
Lush
's
prominent
eyes
,
fat
though
not
clumsy
figure
,
and
strong
black
gray
-
besprinkled
hair
of
frizzy
thickness
,
which
,
with
the
rest
of
his
prosperous
person
,
was
enviable
to
many
,
created
one
of
the
strongest
of
her
antipathies
.
<EOS>
To
be
safe
from
his
looking
at
her
,
she
murmured
to
Grandcourt
,
"
I
should
like
to
continue
walking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
obeyed
immediately
;
but
when
they
were
thus
away
from
any
audience
,
he
spoke
no
word
for
several
minutes
,
and
she
,
out
of
a
half
-
amused
,
half
-
serious
inclination
for
experiment
,
would
not
speak
first
.
<EOS>
They
turned
into
the
large
conservatory
,
beautifully
lit
up
with
Chinese
lamps
.
<EOS>
The
other
couples
there
were
at
a
distance
which
would
not
have
interfered
with
any
dialogue
,
but
still
they
walked
in
silence
until
they
had
reached
the
farther
end
where
there
was
a
flush
of
pink
light
,
and
the
second
wide
opening
into
the
ball
-
room
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
,
when
they
had
half
turned
round
,
paused
and
said
languidly
    
"
Do
you
like
this
kind
of
thing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
If
the
situation
had
been
described
to
Gwendolen
half
an
hour
before
,
she
would
have
laughed
heartily
at
it
,
and
could
only
have
imagined
herself
returning
a
playful
,
satirical
answer
.
<EOS>
But
for
some
mysterious
reason
 
it
was
a
mystery
of
which
she
had
a
faint
wondering
consciousness
 
<EOS>
she
dared
not
be
satirical
:
she
had
begun
to
feel
a
wand
over
her
that
made
her
afraid
of
offending
Grandcourt
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
she
said
,
quietly
,
without
considering
what
"
kind
of
thing
"
was
meant
 
whether
the
flowers
,
the
scents
,
the
ball
in
general
,
or
this
episode
of
walking
with
Mr.
Grandcourt
in
particular
.
<EOS>
And
they
returned
along
the
conservatory
without
farther
interpretation
.
<EOS>
She
then
proposed
to
go
and
sit
down
in
her
old
place
,
and
they
walked
among
scattered
couples
preparing
for
the
waltz
to
the
spot
where
Mrs.
Davilow
had
been
seated
all
the
evening
.
<EOS>
As
they
approached
it
her
seat
was
vacant
,
but
she
was
coming
toward
it
again
,
and
,
to
Gwendolen
's
shuddering
annoyance
,
with
Mr.
Lush
at
her
elbow
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
avoiding
the
confrontation
:
her
mamma
came
close
to
her
before
they
had
reached
the
seats
,
and
,
after
a
quiet
greeting
smile
,
said
innocently
,
"
Gwendolen
,
dear
,
let
me
present
Mr.
Lush
to
you
.
"
<EOS>
Having
just
made
the
acquaintance
of
this
personage
,
as
an
intimate
and
constant
companion
of
Mr.
Grandcourt
's
,
Mrs.
Davilow
imagined
it
altogether
desirable
that
her
daughter
also
should
make
the
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
hardly
a
bow
that
Gwendolen
gave
 
rather
<EOS>
,
it
was
the
slightest
forward
sweep
of
the
head
away
from
the
physiognomy
that
inclined
itself
toward
her
,
and
she
immediately
moved
toward
her
seat
,
saying
,
"
I
want
to
put
on
my
burnous
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
sooner
had
she
reached
it
,
than
Mr.
Lush
was
there
,
and
had
the
burnous
in
his
hand
:
to
annoy
this
supercilious
young
lady
,
he
would
incur
the
offense
of
forestalling
Grandcourt
;
and
,
holding
up
the
garment
close
to
Gwendolen
,
he
said
,
"
Pray
,
permit
me
?
"
<EOS>
But
she
,
wheeling
away
from
him
as
if
he
had
been
a
muddy
hound
,
glided
on
to
the
ottoman
,
saying
,
"
No
,
thank
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
man
who
forgave
this
would
have
much
Christian
feeling
,
supposing
he
had
intended
to
be
agreeable
to
the
young
lady
;
but
before
he
seized
the
burnous
Mr.
Lush
had
ceased
to
have
that
intention
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
quietly
took
the
drapery
from
him
,
and
Mr.
Lush
,
with
a
slight
bow
,
moved
away
.
<EOS>
"
You
had
perhaps
better
put
it
on
,
"
said
Mr.
Grandcourt
,
looking
down
on
her
without
change
of
expression
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thanks
;
perhaps
it
would
be
wise
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
rising
,
and
submitting
very
gracefully
to
take
the
burnous
on
her
shoulders
.
  
<EOS>
After
that
,
Mr.
Grandcourt
exchanged
a
few
polite
speeches
with
Mrs.
Davilow
,
and
,
in
taking
leave
,
asked
permission
to
call
at
Offendene
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
He
was
evidently
not
offended
by
the
insult
directed
toward
his
friend
.
<EOS>
Certainly
Gwendolen
's
refusal
of
the
burnous
from
Mr.
Lush
was
open
to
the
interpretation
that
she
wished
to
receive
it
from
Mr.
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
But
she
,
poor
child
,
had
no
design
in
this
action
,
and
was
simply
following
her
antipathy
and
inclination
,
confiding
in
them
as
she
did
in
the
more
reflective
judgments
into
which
they
entered
as
sap
into
leafage
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
had
no
sense
that
these
men
were
dark
enigmas
to
her
,
or
that
she
needed
any
help
in
drawing
conclusions
about
them
 
Mr.
Grandcourt
at
least
.
<EOS>
The
chief
question
was
,
how
far
his
character
and
ways
might
answer
her
wishes
;
and
unless
she
were
satisfied
about
that
,
she
had
said
to
herself
that
she
would
not
accept
his
offer
.
  
<EOS>
Could
there
be
a
slenderer
,
more
insignificant
thread
in
human
history
than
this
consciousness
of
a
girl
,
busy
with
her
small
inferences
of
the
way
in
which
she
could
make
her
life
pleasant
?
 
<EOS>
in
a
time
,
too
,
when
ideas
were
with
fresh
vigor
making
armies
of
themselves
,
and
the
universal
kinship
was
declaring
itself
fiercely
;
when
women
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
would
not
mourn
for
the
husbands
and
sons
who
died
bravely
in
a
common
cause
,
and
men
stinted
of
bread
on
our
side
of
the
world
heard
of
that
willing
loss
and
were
patient
:
a
time
when
the
soul
of
man
was
walking
to
pulses
which
had
for
centuries
been
beating
in
him
unfelt
,
until
their
full
sum
made
a
new
life
of
terror
or
of
joy
.
  
<EOS>
What
in
the
midst
of
that
mighty
drama
are
girls
and
their
blind
visions
?
<EOS>
They
are
the
Yea
or
Nay
of
that
good
for
which
men
are
enduring
and
fighting
.
<EOS>
In
these
delicate
vessels
is
borne
onward
through
the
ages
the
treasure
of
human
affections
.
      
<EOS>
"
O
gentlemen
,
the
time
of
life
is
short
;
  
To
spend
that
shortness
basely
were
too
long
,
  
If
life
did
ride
upon
a
dial
's
point
,
  
Still
ending
at
the
arrival
of
an
hour
.

SHAKESPEARE
:
<EOS>
_
Henry
IV
_
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
second
day
after
the
Archery
Meeting
,
Mr.
Henleigh
Mallinger
Grandcourt
was
at
his
breakfast
-
table
with
Mr.
Lush
.
<EOS>
Everything
around
them
was
agreeable
:
the
summer
air
through
the
open
windows
,
at
which
the
dogs
could
walk
in
from
the
old
green
turf
on
the
lawn
;
the
soft
,
purplish
coloring
of
the
park
beyond
,
stretching
toward
a
mass
of
bordering
wood
;
the
still
life
in
the
room
,
which
seemed
the
stiller
for
its
sober
antiquated
elegance
,
as
if
it
kept
a
conscious
,
well
-
bred
silence
,
unlike
the
restlessness
of
vulgar
furniture
.
  
<EOS>
Whether
the
gentlemen
were
agreeable
to
each
other
was
less
evident
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grandcourt
had
drawn
his
chair
aside
so
as
to
face
the
lawn
,
and
with
his
left
leg
over
another
chair
,
and
his
right
elbow
on
the
table
,
was
smoking
a
large
cigar
,
while
his
companion
was
still
eating
.
<EOS>
The
dogs
 
half
-
a
-
dozen
of
various
kinds
were
moving
lazily
in
and
out
,
taking
attitudes
of
brief
attention
 
gave
a
vacillating
preference
first
to
one
gentleman
,
then
to
the
other
;
being
dogs
in
such
good
circumstances
that
they
could
play
at
hunger
,
and
liked
to
be
served
with
delicacies
which
they
declined
to
put
in
their
mouths
;
all
except
Fetch
,
the
beautiful
liver
-
colored
water
-
spaniel
,
which
sat
with
its
forepaws
firmly
planted
and
its
expressive
brown
face
turned
upward
,
watching
Grandcourt
with
unshaken
constancy
.
<EOS>
He
held
in
his
lap
a
tiny
Maltese
dog
with
a
tiny
silver
collar
and
bell
,
and
when
he
had
a
hand
unused
by
cigar
or
coffee
-
cup
,
it
rested
on
this
small
parcel
of
animal
warmth
.
<EOS>
I
fear
that
Fetch
was
jealous
,
and
wounded
that
her
master
gave
her
no
word
or
look
;
at
last
it
seemed
that
she
could
bear
this
neglect
no
longer
,
and
she
gently
put
her
large
silky
paw
on
her
master
's
leg
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
looked
at
her
with
unchanged
face
for
half
a
minute
,
and
then
took
the
trouble
to
lay
down
his
cigar
while
he
lifted
the
unimpassioned
Fluff
close
to
his
chin
and
gave
it
caressing
pats
,
all
the
while
gravely
watching
Fetch
,
who
,
poor
thing
,
whimpered
interruptedly
,
as
if
trying
to
repress
that
sign
of
discontent
,
and
at
last
rested
her
head
beside
the
appealing
paw
,
looking
up
with
piteous
beseeching
.
<EOS>
So
,
at
least
,
a
lover
of
dogs
must
have
interpreted
Fetch
,
and
Grandcourt
kept
so
many
dogs
that
he
was
reputed
to
love
them
;
at
any
rate
,
his
impulse
to
act
just
in
that
way
started
from
such
an
interpretation
.
<EOS>
But
when
the
amusing
anguish
burst
forth
in
a
howling
bark
,
Grandcourt
pushed
Fetch
down
without
speaking
,
and
,
depositing
Fluff
carelessly
on
the
table
(
where
his
black
nose
predominated
over
a
salt
-
cellar
)
,
began
to
look
to
his
cigar
,
and
found
,
with
some
annoyance
against
Fetch
as
the
cause
,
that
the
brute
of
a
cigar
required
relighting
.
<EOS>
Fetch
,
having
begun
to
wail
,
found
,
like
others
of
her
sex
,
that
it
was
not
easy
to
leave
off
;
indeed
,
the
second
howl
was
a
louder
one
,
and
the
third
was
like
unto
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Turn
out
that
brute
,
will
you
?
"
said
Grandcourt
to
Lush
,
without
raising
his
voice
or
looking
at
him
 
as
if
he
counted
on
attention
to
the
smallest
sign
.
  
<EOS>
And
Lush
immediately
rose
,
lifted
Fetch
,
though
she
was
rather
heavy
,
and
he
was
not
fond
of
stooping
,
and
carried
her
out
,
disposing
of
her
in
some
way
that
took
him
a
couple
of
minutes
before
he
returned
.
<EOS>
He
then
lit
a
cigar
,
placed
himself
at
an
angle
where
he
could
see
Grandcourt
's
face
without
turning
,
and
presently
said
    
"
Shall
you
ride
or
drive
to
Quetcham
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
going
to
Quetcham
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
did
not
go
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
smoked
in
silence
for
half
a
minute
,
and
then
said
    
"
I
suppose
you
sent
my
card
and
inquiries
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
went
myself
at
four
,
and
said
you
were
sure
to
be
there
shortly
.
<EOS>
They
would
suppose
some
accident
prevented
you
from
fulfilling
the
intention
.
<EOS>
Especially
if
you
go
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Silence
for
a
couple
of
minutes
.
<EOS>
Then
Grandcourt
said
,
"
What
men
are
invited
here
with
their
wives
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lush
drew
out
a
note
-
book
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Captain
and
Mrs.
Torrington
come
next
week
.
<EOS>
Then
there
are
Mr.
Hollis
and
Lady
Flora
,
and
the
Cushats
and
the
Gogoffs
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Rather
a
ragged
lot
,
"
remarked
Grandcourt
,
after
a
while
.
<EOS>
"
Why
did
you
ask
the
Gogoffs
?
<EOS>
When
you
write
invitations
in
my
name
,
be
good
enough
to
give
me
a
list
,
instead
of
bringing
down
a
giantess
on
me
without
my
knowledge
.
<EOS>
She
spoils
the
look
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
invited
the
Gogoffs
yourself
when
you
met
them
in
Paris
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
has
my
meeting
them
in
Paris
to
do
with
it
?
<EOS>
I
told
you
to
give
me
a
list
.
"
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
,
like
many
others
,
had
two
remarkably
different
voices
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
we
have
heard
him
speaking
in
a
superficial
interrupted
drawl
<EOS>
suggestive
chiefly
of
languor
and
_
<EOS>
ennui
_
.
<EOS>
But
this
last
brief
speech
was
uttered
in
subdued
inward
,
yet
distinct
,
tones
,
which
Lush
had
long
been
used
to
recognize
as
the
expression
of
a
peremptory
will
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
there
any
other
couples
you
would
like
to
invite
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
think
of
some
decent
people
,
with
a
daughter
or
two
.
<EOS>
And
one
of
your
damned
musicians
.
<EOS>
But
not
a
comic
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
if
Klesmer
would
consent
to
come
to
us
when
he
leaves
Quetcham
.
<EOS>
Nothing
but
first
-
class
music
will
go
down
with
Miss
Arrowpoint
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lush
spoke
carelessly
,
but
he
was
really
seizing
an
opportunity
and
fixing
an
observant
look
on
Grandcourt
,
who
now
for
the
first
time
,
turned
his
eyes
toward
his
companion
,
but
slowly
and
without
speaking
until
he
had
given
two
long
luxuriant
puffs
,
when
he
said
,
perhaps
in
a
lower
tone
than
ever
,
but
with
a
perceptible
edge
of
contempt
    
<EOS>
"
What
in
the
name
of
nonsense
have
I
to
do
with
Miss
Arrowpoint
and
her
music
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
something
,
"
said
Lush
,
jocosely
.
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
give
yourself
much
trouble
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
But
some
forms
must
be
gone
through
before
a
man
can
marry
a
million
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
likely
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
not
going
to
marry
a
million
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
pity
 
to
fling
away
an
opportunity
of
this
sort
,
and
knock
down
your
own
plans
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
_
Your
_
plans
,
I
suppose
you
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
some
debts
,
you
know
,
and
things
may
turn
out
inconveniently
after
all
.
<EOS>
The
heirship
is
not
_
absolutely
_
certain
.
"
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
did
not
answer
,
and
Lush
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
really
is
a
fine
opportunity
.
<EOS>
The
father
and
mother
ask
for
nothing
better
,
I
can
see
,
and
the
daughter
's
looks
and
manners
require
no
allowances
,
any
more
than
if
she
had
n't
a
sixpence
.
<EOS>
She
is
not
beautiful
;
but
equal
to
carrying
any
rank
.
<EOS>
And
she
is
not
likely
to
refuse
such
prospects
as
you
can
offer
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
father
and
mother
would
let
you
do
anything
you
like
with
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
should
not
like
to
do
anything
with
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
Here
it
was
Lush
who
made
a
little
pause
before
speaking
again
,
and
then
he
said
in
a
deep
voice
of
remonstrance
,
"
<EOS>
Good
God
,
Grandcourt
!
<EOS>
after
your
experience
,
will
you
let
a
whim
interfere
with
your
comfortable
settlement
in
life
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Spare
your
oratory
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
I
am
going
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
?
"
<EOS>
Lush
put
down
his
cigar
and
thrust
his
hands
into
his
side
pockets
,
as
if
he
had
to
face
something
exasperating
,
but
meant
to
keep
his
temper
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
to
marry
the
other
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Have
you
fallen
in
love
?
"
<EOS>
This
question
carried
a
strong
sneer
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
to
marry
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
made
her
an
offer
already
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
a
young
lady
with
a
will
of
her
own
,
I
fancy
.
<EOS>
Extremely
well
fitted
to
make
a
rumpus
.
<EOS>
She
would
know
what
she
liked
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
does
n't
like
you
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
with
the
ghost
of
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perfectly
true
,
"
said
Lush
,
adding
again
in
a
markedly
sneering
tone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
However
,
if
you
and
she
are
devoted
to
each
other
,
that
will
be
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
took
no
notice
of
this
speech
,
but
sipped
his
coffee
,
rose
,
and
strolled
out
on
the
lawn
,
all
the
dogs
following
him
.
  
<EOS>
Lush
glanced
after
him
a
moment
,
then
resumed
his
cigar
and
lit
it
,
but
smoked
slowly
,
consulting
his
beard
with
inspecting
eyes
and
fingers
,
till
he
finally
stroked
it
with
an
air
of
having
arrived
at
some
conclusion
,
and
said
in
a
subdued
voice
    
"
Check
,
old
boy
!
"
  
<EOS>
Lush
,
being
a
man
of
some
ability
,
had
not
known
Grandcourt
for
fifteen
years
without
learning
what
sort
of
measures
were
useless
with
him
,
though
what
sort
might
be
useful
remained
often
dubious
.
<EOS>
In
the
beginning
of
his
career
he
held
a
fellowship
,
and
was
near
taking
orders
for
the
sake
of
a
college
living
,
but
not
being
fond
of
that
prospect
accepted
instead
the
office
of
traveling
companion
to
a
marquess
,
and
afterward
to
young
Grandcourt
,
who
had
lost
his
father
early
,
and
who
found
Lush
so
convenient
that
he
had
allowed
him
to
become
prime
minister
in
all
his
more
personal
affairs
.
<EOS>
The
habit
of
fifteen
years
had
made
Grandcourt
more
and
more
in
need
of
Lush
's
handiness
,
and
Lush
more
and
more
in
need
of
the
lazy
luxury
to
which
his
transactions
on
behalf
of
Grandcourt
made
no
interruption
worth
reckoning
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
the
same
lengthened
habit
had
intensified
Grandcourt
's
want
of
respect
for
his
companion
since
that
want
had
been
absolute
from
the
beginning
,
but
it
had
confirmed
his
sense
that
he
might
kick
Lush
if
he
chose
 
only
he
never
did
choose
to
kick
any
animal
,
because
the
act
of
kicking
is
a
compromising
attitude
,
and
a
gentleman
's
dogs
should
be
kicked
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
only
said
things
which
might
have
exposed
himself
to
be
kicked
if
his
confidant
had
been
a
man
of
independent
spirit
.
<EOS>
But
what
son
of
a
vicar
who
has
stinted
his
wife
and
daughters
of
calico
in
order
to
send
his
male
offspring
to
Oxford
,
can
keep
an
independent
spirit
when
he
is
bent
on
dining
with
high
discrimination
,
riding
good
horses
,
living
generally
in
the
most
luxuriant
honey
-
blossomed
clover
 
and
all
without
working
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Lush
had
passed
for
a
scholar
once
,
and
had
still
a
sense
of
scholarship
when
he
was
not
trying
to
remember
much
of
it
;
but
the
bachelor
's
and
other
arts
which
soften
manners
are
a
time
-
honored
preparation
for
sinecures
;
and
Lush
's
present
comfortable
provision
was
as
good
a
sinecure
in
not
requiring
more
than
the
odor
of
departed
learning
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
unconscious
of
being
held
kickable
,
but
he
preferred
counting
that
estimate
among
the
peculiarities
of
Grandcourt
's
character
,
which
made
one
of
his
incalculable
moods
or
judgments
as
good
as
another
.
<EOS>
Since
in
his
own
opinion
he
had
never
done
a
bad
action
,
it
did
not
seem
necessary
to
consider
whether
he
should
be
likely
to
commit
one
if
his
love
of
ease
required
it
.
<EOS>
Lush
's
love
of
ease
was
well
-
satisfied
at
present
,
and
if
his
puddings
were
rolled
toward
him
in
the
dust
,
he
took
the
inside
bits
and
found
them
relishing
.
  
<EOS>
This
morning
,
for
example
,
though
he
had
encountered
more
annoyance
than
usual
,
he
went
to
his
private
sitting
-
room
and
played
a
good
hour
on
the
violoncello
.
      
<EOS>
"
Philistia
,
be
thou
glad
of
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
Grandcourt
having
made
up
his
mind
to
marry
Miss
Harleth
,
showed
a
power
of
adapting
means
to
ends
.
<EOS>
During
the
next
fortnight
there
was
hardly
a
day
on
which
by
some
arrangement
or
other
he
did
not
see
her
,
or
prove
by
emphatic
attentions
that
she
occupied
his
thoughts
.
<EOS>
His
cousin
,
Mrs.
Torrington
,
was
now
doing
the
honors
of
his
house
,
so
that
Mrs.
Davilow
and
Gwendolen
could
be
invited
to
a
large
party
at
Diplow
in
which
there
were
many
witnesses
how
the
host
distinguished
the
dowerless
beauty
,
and
showed
no
solicitude
about
the
heiress
.
<EOS>
The
world
 
<EOS>
I
mean
Mr.
Gascoigne
and
all
the
families
worth
speaking
of
within
visiting
distance
of
Pennicote
 
felt
an
assurance
on
the
subject
which
in
the
rector
's
mind
converted
itself
into
a
resolution
to
do
his
duty
by
his
niece
and
see
that
the
settlements
were
adequate
.
<EOS>
Indeed
the
wonder
to
him
and
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
was
that
the
offer
for
which
so
many
suitable
occasions
presented
themselves
had
not
been
already
made
;
and
in
this
wonder
Grandcourt
himself
was
not
without
a
share
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
told
his
resolution
to
Lush
he
had
thought
that
the
affair
would
be
concluded
more
quickly
,
and
to
his
own
surprise
he
had
repeatedly
promised
himself
in
a
morning
that
he
would
to
-
day
give
Gwendolen
the
opportunity
of
accepting
him
,
and
had
found
in
the
evening
that
the
necessary
formality
was
still
unaccomplished
.
<EOS>
This
remarkable
fact
served
to
heighten
his
determination
on
another
day
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
admitted
to
himself
that
Gwendolen
might
refuse
him
,
but
 
heaven
help
us
all
!
 
<EOS>
we
are
often
unable
to
act
on
our
certainties
;
our
objection
to
a
contrary
issue
(
were
it
possible
)
is
so
strong
that
it
rises
like
a
spectral
illusion
between
us
and
our
certainty
;
we
are
rationally
sure
that
the
blind
worm
can
not
bite
us
mortally
,
but
it
would
be
so
intolerable
to
be
bitten
,
and
the
creature
has
a
biting
look
 
we
decline
to
handle
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
asked
leave
to
have
a
beautiful
horse
of
his
brought
for
Gwendolen
to
ride
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
was
to
accompany
her
in
the
carriage
,
and
they
were
to
go
to
Diplow
to
lunch
,
Grandcourt
conducting
them
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
fine
mid
-
harvest
time
,
not
too
warm
for
a
noonday
ride
of
five
miles
to
be
delightful
;
the
poppies
glowed
on
the
borders
of
the
fields
,
there
was
enough
breeze
to
move
gently
like
a
social
spirit
among
the
ears
of
uncut
corn
,
and
to
wing
the
shadow
of
a
cloud
across
the
soft
gray
downs
;
here
the
sheaves
were
standing
,
there
the
horses
were
straining
their
muscles
under
the
last
load
from
a
wide
space
of
stubble
,
but
everywhere
the
green
pasture
made
a
broader
setting
for
the
corn
-
fields
,
and
the
cattle
took
their
rest
under
wide
branches
.
<EOS>
The
road
lay
through
a
bit
of
country
where
the
dairy
-
farms
looked
much
as
they
did
in
the
days
of
our
forefathers
 
where
peace
and
permanence
seemed
to
find
a
home
away
from
the
busy
change
that
sent
the
railway
train
flying
in
the
distance
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
spirit
of
peace
and
permanence
did
not
penetrate
poor
Mrs.
Davilow
's
mind
so
as
to
overcome
her
habit
of
uneasy
foreboding
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
and
Grandcourt
cantering
in
front
of
her
,
and
then
slackening
their
pace
to
a
conversational
walk
till
the
carriage
came
up
with
them
again
,
made
a
gratifying
sight
;
but
it
served
chiefly
to
keep
up
the
conflict
of
hopes
and
fears
about
her
daughter
's
lot
.
<EOS>
Here
was
an
irresistible
opportunity
for
a
lover
to
speak
and
put
an
end
to
all
uncertainties
,
and
Mrs.
Davilow
could
only
hope
with
trembling
that
Gwendolen
's
decision
would
be
favorable
.
<EOS>
Certainly
if
Rex
's
love
had
been
repugnant
to
her
,
Mr.
Grandcourt
had
the
advantage
of
being
in
complete
contrast
with
Rex
;
and
that
he
had
produced
some
quite
novel
impression
on
her
seemed
evident
in
her
marked
abstinence
from
satirical
observations
,
nay
,
her
total
silence
about
his
characteristics
,
a
silence
which
Mrs.
Davilow
did
not
dare
to
break
.
<EOS>
"
Is
he
a
man
she
would
be
happy
with
?
"
 
was
a
question
that
inevitably
arose
in
the
mother
's
mind
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
perhaps
as
happy
as
she
would
be
with
any
one
else
 
or
<EOS>
as
most
other
women
are
"
 
was
the
answer
with
which
she
tried
to
quiet
herself
;
for
she
could
not
imagine
Gwendolen
under
the
influence
of
any
feeling
which
would
make
her
satisfied
in
what
we
traditionally
call
"
mean
circumstances
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
's
own
thought
was
looking
in
the
same
direction
:
he
wanted
to
have
done
with
the
uncertainty
that
belonged
to
his
not
having
spoken
.
<EOS>
As
to
any
further
uncertainty
 
well
,
it
was
something
without
any
reasonable
basis
,
some
quality
in
the
air
which
acted
as
an
irritant
to
his
wishes
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
enjoyed
the
riding
,
but
her
pleasure
did
not
break
forth
in
girlish
unpremeditated
chat
and
laughter
as
it
did
on
that
morning
with
Rex
.
<EOS>
She
spoke
a
little
,
and
even
laughed
,
but
with
a
lightness
as
of
a
far
-
off
echo
:
<EOS>
for
her
too
there
was
some
peculiar
quality
in
the
air
 
not
<EOS>
,
she
was
sure
,
any
subjugation
of
her
will
by
Mr.
Grandcourt
,
and
the
splendid
prospects
he
meant
to
offer
her
;
for
Gwendolen
desired
every
one
,
that
dignified
gentleman
himself
included
,
to
understand
that
she
was
going
to
do
just
as
she
liked
,
and
that
they
had
better
not
calculate
on
her
pleasing
them
.
<EOS>
If
she
chose
to
take
this
husband
,
she
would
have
him
know
that
she
was
not
going
to
renounce
her
freedom
,
or
according
to
her
favorite
formula
,
"
not
going
to
do
as
other
women
did
.
"
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
's
speeches
this
morning
were
,
as
usual
,
all
of
that
brief
sort
which
never
fails
to
make
a
conversational
figure
when
the
speaker
is
held
important
in
his
circle
.
<EOS>
Stopping
so
soon
,
they
give
signs
of
a
suppressed
and
formidable
ability
<EOS>
so
say
more
,
and
have
also
the
meritorious
quality
of
allowing
lengthiness
to
others
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
like
Criterion
's
paces
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
after
they
had
entered
the
park
and
were
slacking
from
a
canter
to
a
walk
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
delightful
to
ride
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
have
a
leap
with
him
,
if
it
would
not
frighten
mamma
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
good
wide
channel
we
passed
five
minutes
ago
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
have
a
gallop
back
and
take
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
.
<EOS>
We
can
take
it
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
thanks
.
<EOS>
Mamma
is
so
timid
 
<EOS>
if
she
saw
me
it
might
make
her
ill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
go
and
explain
.
<EOS>
Criterion
would
take
it
without
fail
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
 
indeed
 
you
are
very
kind
 
<EOS>
but
it
would
alarm
her
too
much
.
<EOS>
I
dare
take
any
leap
when
she
is
not
by
;
but
I
do
it
and
do
n't
tell
her
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
can
let
the
carriage
pass
and
then
set
off
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
pray
do
n't
think
of
it
any
more
:
I
spoke
quite
randomly
,
"
said
Gwendolen
;
she
began
to
feel
a
new
objection
to
carrying
out
her
own
proposition
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
Mrs.
Davilow
knows
I
shall
take
care
of
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
but
she
would
think
of
you
as
having
to
take
care
of
my
broken
neck
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
considerable
pause
before
Grandcourt
said
,
looking
toward
her
,
"
I
should
like
to
have
the
right
always
to
take
care
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
did
not
turn
her
eyes
on
him
;
it
seemed
to
her
a
long
while
that
she
was
first
blushing
,
and
then
turning
pale
,
but
to
Grandcourt
's
rate
of
judgment
she
answered
soon
enough
,
with
the
lightest
flute
-
tone
and
a
careless
movement
of
the
head
,
"
Oh
,
I
am
not
sure
that
I
want
to
be
taken
care
of
:
if
I
chose
to
risk
breaking
my
neck
,
I
should
like
to
be
at
liberty
to
do
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
checked
her
horse
as
she
spoke
,
and
turned
in
her
saddle
,
looking
toward
the
advancing
carriage
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
swept
across
Grandcourt
as
she
made
this
movement
,
but
there
was
no
language
in
them
to
correct
the
carelessness
of
her
reply
.
<EOS>
At
that
very
moment
she
was
aware
that
she
was
risking
something
 
not
her
neck
,
but
the
possibility
of
finally
checking
Grandcourt
's
advances
,
and
she
did
not
feel
contented
with
the
possibility
.
  
<EOS>
"
Damn
her
!
"
thought
Grandcourt
,
as
he
too
checked
his
horse
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
a
wordy
thinker
,
and
this
explosive
phrase
stood
for
mixed
impressions
which
eloquent
interpreters
might
have
expanded
into
some
sentences
full
of
an
irritated
sense
that
he
was
being
mystified
,
and
a
determination
that
this
girl
should
not
make
a
fool
of
him
.
<EOS>
Did
she
want
him
to
throw
himself
at
her
feet
and
declare
that
he
was
dying
for
her
?
<EOS>
It
was
not
by
that
gate
that
she
could
enter
on
the
privileges
he
could
give
her
.
<EOS>
Or
did
she
expect
him
to
write
his
proposals
?
<EOS>
Equally
a
delusion
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
make
his
offer
in
any
way
that
could
place
him
definitely
in
the
position
of
being
rejected
.
<EOS>
But
as
to
her
accepting
him
,
she
had
done
it
already
in
accepting
his
marked
attentions
:
and
anything
which
happened
to
break
them
off
would
be
understood
to
her
disadvantage
.
<EOS>
She
was
merely
coquetting
,
then
?
  
<EOS>
However
,
the
carriage
came
up
,
and
no
further
_
tete
-
à
-
tete
_
could
well
occur
before
their
arrival
at
the
house
,
where
there
was
abundant
company
,
to
whom
Gwendolen
,
clad
in
riding
-
dress
,
with
her
hat
laid
aside
,
clad
also
in
the
repute
of
being
chosen
by
Mr.
Grandcourt
,
was
naturally
a
centre
of
observation
;
and
since
the
objectionable
Mr.
Lush
was
not
there
to
look
at
her
,
this
stimulus
of
admiring
attention
heightened
her
spirits
,
and
dispersed
,
for
the
time
,
the
uneasy
consciousness
of
divided
impulses
which
threatened
her
with
repentance
of
her
own
acts
.
<EOS>
Whether
Grandcourt
had
been
offended
or
not
there
was
no
judging
:
his
manners
were
unchanged
,
but
Gwendolen
's
acuteness
had
not
gone
deeper
than
to
discern
that
his
manners
were
no
clue
for
her
,
and
because
these
were
unchanged
<EOS>
she
was
not
the
less
afraid
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
not
been
at
Diplow
before
except
to
dine
;
and
since
certain
points
of
view
from
the
windows
and
the
garden
were
worth
showing
,
Lady
Flora
Hollis
proposed
after
luncheon
,
when
some
of
the
guests
had
dispersed
,
and
the
sun
was
sloping
toward
four
o'clock
,
that
the
remaining
party
should
make
a
little
exploration
.
<EOS>
Here
came
frequent
opportunities
when
Grandcourt
might
have
retained
Gwendolen
apart
,
and
have
spoken
to
her
unheard
.
<EOS>
But
no
!
<EOS>
He
indeed
spoke
to
no
one
else
,
but
what
he
said
was
nothing
more
eager
or
intimate
than
it
had
been
in
their
first
interview
.
<EOS>
He
looked
at
her
not
less
than
usual
;
and
some
of
her
defiant
spirit
having
come
back
,
she
looked
full
at
him
in
return
,
not
caring
 
rather
preferring
 
that
his
eyes
had
no
expression
in
them
.
  
<EOS>
But
at
last
it
seemed
as
if
he
entertained
some
contrivance
.
<EOS>
After
they
had
nearly
made
the
tour
of
the
grounds
,
the
whole
party
stopped
by
the
pool
to
be
amused
with
Fetch
's
accomplishment
of
bringing
a
water
lily
to
the
bank
like
Cowper
's
spaniel
Beau
,
and
having
been
disappointed
in
his
first
attempt
insisted
on
his
trying
again
.
  
<EOS>
Here
Grandcourt
,
who
stood
with
Gwendolen
outside
the
group
,
turned
deliberately
,
and
fixing
his
eyes
on
a
knoll
planted
with
American
shrubs
,
and
having
a
winding
path
up
it
,
said
languidly
    
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
bore
.
<EOS>
Shall
we
go
up
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
certainly
 
since
we
are
exploring
,
"
said
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
She
was
rather
pleased
,
and
yet
afraid
.
  
<EOS>
The
path
was
too
narrow
for
him
to
offer
his
arm
,
and
they
walked
up
in
silence
.
<EOS>
When
they
were
on
the
bit
of
platform
at
the
summit
,
Grandcourt
said
    
"
There
is
nothing
to
be
seen
here
:
the
thing
was
not
worth
climbing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
How
was
it
that
Gwendolen
did
not
laugh
?
<EOS>
She
was
perfectly
silent
,
holding
up
the
folds
of
her
robe
like
a
statue
,
and
giving
a
harder
grasp
to
the
handle
of
her
whip
,
which
she
had
snatched
up
automatically
with
her
hat
when
they
had
first
set
off
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
sort
of
a
place
do
you
prefer
?
"
said
Grandcourt
.
  
<EOS>
"
Different
places
are
agreeable
in
their
way
.
<EOS>
On
the
whole
,
I
think
,
I
prefer
places
that
are
open
and
cheerful
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
fond
of
anything
sombre
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
place
of
Offendene
is
too
sombre
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
rather
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
remain
there
long
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
I
think
so
.
<EOS>
Mamma
likes
to
be
near
her
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Silence
for
a
short
space
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
_
you
_
will
always
live
there
,
though
Mrs.
Davilow
may
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
We
women
ca
n't
go
in
search
of
adventures
 
to
find
out
the
North
-
West
Passage
or
the
source
of
the
Nile
,
or
to
hunt
tigers
in
the
East
.
<EOS>
We
must
stay
where
we
grow
,
or
where
the
gardeners
like
to
transplant
us
.
<EOS>
We
are
brought
up
like
the
flowers
,
to
look
as
pretty
as
we
can
,
and
be
dull
without
complaining
.
<EOS>
That
is
my
notion
about
the
plants
;
they
are
often
bored
,
and
that
is
the
reason
why
some
of
them
have
got
poisonous
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
Gwendolen
had
run
on
rather
nervously
,
lightly
whipping
the
rhododendron
bush
in
front
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
quite
agree
.
<EOS>
Most
things
are
bores
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
his
mind
having
been
pushed
into
an
easy
current
,
away
from
its
intended
track
.
<EOS>
But
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
he
continued
in
his
broken
,
refined
drawl
    
<EOS>
"
But
a
woman
can
be
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Some
women
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
,
certainly
,
unless
you
are
obstinately
cruel
.
"
  
"
I
am
not
sure
that
I
am
not
both
cruel
and
obstinate
.
"
<EOS>
Here
Gwendolen
suddenly
turned
her
head
and
looked
full
at
Grandcourt
,
whose
eyes
she
had
felt
to
be
upon
her
throughout
their
conversation
.
<EOS>
She
was
wondering
what
the
effect
of
looking
at
him
would
be
on
herself
rather
than
on
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
stood
perfectly
still
,
half
a
yard
or
more
away
from
her
;
and
it
flashed
through
her
mind
what
a
sort
of
lotus
-
eater
's
stupor
had
begun
in
him
and
was
taking
possession
of
her
.
<EOS>
Then
he
said
    
"
Are
you
as
uncertain
about
yourself
as
you
make
others
about
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
uncertain
about
myself
;
I
do
n't
know
how
uncertain
others
may
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
wish
them
to
understand
that
you
do
n't
care
?
"
said
Grandcourt
,
with
a
touch
of
new
hardness
in
his
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
say
that
,
"
Gwendolen
replied
,
hesitatingly
,
and
turning
her
eyes
away
whipped
the
rhododendron
bush
again
.
<EOS>
She
wished
she
were
on
horseback
that
she
might
set
off
on
a
canter
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
set
off
running
down
the
knoll
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
care
,
then
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
not
more
quickly
,
<EOS>
but
with
a
softened
drawl
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
my
whip
!
<EOS>
"
said
Gwendolen
,
in
a
little
scream
of
distress
.
<EOS>
She
had
let
it
go
 
<EOS>
what
could
be
more
natural
in
a
slight
agitation
?
 
<EOS>
and
 
<EOS>
but
this
seemed
less
natural
in
a
gold
-
handled
whip
which
had
been
left
altogether
to
itself
 
<EOS>
it
had
gone
with
some
force
over
the
immediate
shrubs
,
and
had
lodged
itself
in
the
branches
of
an
azalea
half
-
way
down
the
knoll
.
<EOS>
She
could
run
down
now
,
laughing
prettily
,
and
Grandcourt
was
obliged
to
follow
;
but
she
was
beforehand
with
him
in
rescuing
the
whip
,
and
continued
on
her
way
to
the
level
ground
,
when
she
paused
and
looked
at
Grandcourt
with
an
exasperating
brightness
in
her
glance
and
a
heightened
color
,
as
if
she
had
carried
a
triumph
,
and
these
indications
were
still
noticeable
to
Mrs.
Davilow
when
Gwendolen
and
Grandcourt
joined
the
rest
of
the
party
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
all
coquetting
,
"
thought
Grandcourt
;
"
the
next
time
I
beckon
she
will
come
down
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
him
likely
that
this
final
beckoning
might
happen
the
very
next
day
,
when
there
was
to
be
a
picnic
archery
meeting
in
Cardell
Chase
,
according
to
the
plan
projected
on
the
evening
of
the
ball
.
  
<EOS>
Even
in
Gwendolen
's
mind
<EOS>
that
result
was
one
of
two
likelihoods
that
presented
themselves
alternately
,
one
of
two
decisions
toward
which
she
was
being
precipitated
,
as
if
they
were
two
sides
of
a
boundary
-
line
,
and
she
did
not
know
on
which
she
should
fall
.
<EOS>
This
subjection
to
a
possible
self
,
a
self
not
to
be
absolutely
predicted
about
,
caused
her
some
astonishment
and
terror
;
her
favorite
key
of
life
 
doing
as
she
liked
 
seemed
to
fail
her
,
and
she
could
not
foresee
what
at
a
given
moment
she
might
like
to
do
.
<EOS>
The
prospect
of
marrying
Grandcourt
really
seemed
more
attractive
to
her
than
she
had
believed
beforehand
that
any
marriage
could
be
:
<EOS>
the
dignities
,
the
luxuries
,
the
power
of
doing
a
great
deal
of
what
she
liked
to
do
,
which
had
now
come
close
to
her
,
and
within
her
choice
to
secure
or
to
lose
,
took
hold
of
her
nature
as
if
it
had
been
the
strong
odor
of
what
she
had
only
imagined
and
longed
for
before
.
<EOS>
And
Grandcourt
himself
?
<EOS>
He
seemed
as
little
of
a
flaw
in
his
fortunes
as
a
lover
and
husband
could
possibly
be
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
wished
to
mount
the
chariot
and
drive
the
plunging
horses
herself
,
with
a
spouse
by
her
side
who
would
fold
his
arms
and
give
her
his
countenance
without
looking
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
Certainly
,
with
all
her
perspicacity
,
and
all
the
reading
which
seemed
to
her
mamma
dangerously
instructive
,
her
judgment
was
consciously
a
little
at
fault
before
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
He
was
adorably
quiet
and
free
from
absurdities
 
he
would
be
a
husband
to
suit
with
the
best
appearance
a
woman
could
make
.
<EOS>
But
what
else
was
he
?
<EOS>
He
had
been
everywhere
,
and
seen
everything
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
That
_
was
desirable
,
and
especially
gratifying
as
a
preamble
to
his
supreme
preference
for
Gwendolen
Harleth
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
appear
to
enjoy
anything
much
.
<EOS>
That
was
not
necessary
:
and
the
less
he
had
of
particular
tastes
,
or
desires
,
the
more
freedom
his
wife
was
likely
to
have
in
following
hers
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
conceived
that
after
marriage
she
would
most
probably
be
able
to
manage
him
thoroughly
.
  
<EOS>
How
was
it
that
he
caused
her
unusual
constraint
now
?
 
<EOS>
that
she
was
less
daring
and
playful
in
her
talk
with
him
than
with
any
other
admirer
she
had
known
?
<EOS>
That
absence
of
demonstrativeness
which
she
was
glad
of
,
acted
as
a
charm
in
more
senses
than
one
,
and
was
slightly
benumbing
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
after
all
was
formidable
 
a
handsome
lizard
of
a
hitherto
unknown
species
,
not
of
the
lively
,
darting
kind
.
<EOS>
But
Gwendolen
knew
hardly
anything
about
lizards
,
and
ignorance
gives
one
a
large
range
of
probabilities
.
<EOS>
This
splendid
specimen
was
probably
gentle
,
suitable
as
a
boudoir
pet
:
<EOS>
what
may
not
a
lizard
be
,
if
you
know
nothing
to
the
contrary
?
<EOS>
Her
acquaintance
with
Grandcourt
was
such
that
no
accomplishment
suddenly
revealed
in
him
would
have
surprised
her
.
<EOS>
And
he
was
so
little
suggestive
of
drama
,
that
it
hardly
occurred
to
her
to
think
with
any
detail
how
his
life
of
thirty
-
six
years
had
been
passed
:
in
general
,
she
imagined
him
always
cold
and
dignified
,
not
likely
ever
to
have
committed
himself
.
<EOS>
He
had
hunted
the
tiger
 
<EOS>
had
he
ever
been
in
love
or
made
love
?
<EOS>
The
one
experience
and
the
other
seemed
alike
remote
in
Gwendolen
's
fancy
from
the
Mr.
Grandcourt
who
had
come
to
Diplow
in
order
apparently
to
make
a
chief
epoch
in
her
destiny
 
perhaps
by
introducing
her
to
that
state
of
marriage
which
she
had
resolved
to
make
a
state
of
greater
freedom
than
her
girlhood
.
<EOS>
And
on
the
whole
she
wished
to
marry
him
;
he
suited
her
purpose
;
her
prevailing
,
deliberate
intention
was
,
to
accept
him
.
  
<EOS>
But
was
she
going
to
fulfill
her
deliberate
intention
?
<EOS>
She
began
to
be
afraid
of
herself
,
and
to
find
out
a
certain
difficulty
in
doing
as
she
liked
.
<EOS>
Already
her
assertion
of
independence
in
evading
his
advances
had
been
carried
farther
than
was
necessary
,
and
she
was
thinking
with
some
anxiety
what
she
might
do
on
the
next
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
Seated
according
to
her
habit
with
her
back
to
the
horses
on
their
drive
homeward
,
she
was
completely
under
the
observation
of
her
mamma
,
who
took
the
excitement
and
changefulness
in
the
expression
of
her
eyes
,
her
unwonted
absence
of
mind
and
total
silence
,
as
unmistakable
signs
that
something
unprecedented
had
occurred
between
her
and
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
's
uneasiness
determined
her
to
risk
some
speech
on
the
subject
:
the
Gascoignes
were
to
dine
at
Offendene
,
and
in
what
had
occurred
this
morning
there
might
be
some
reason
for
consulting
the
rector
;
not
that
she
expected
him
anymore
than
herself
to
influence
Gwendolen
,
but
that
her
anxious
mind
wanted
to
be
disburdened
.
  
<EOS>
"
Something
has
happened
,
dear
?
<EOS>
"
she
began
,
in
a
tender
tone
of
question
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
looked
round
,
and
seeming
to
be
roused
to
the
consciousness
of
her
physical
self
,
took
off
her
gloves
and
then
her
hat
,
that
the
soft
breeze
might
blow
on
her
head
.
<EOS>
They
were
in
a
retired
bit
of
the
road
,
where
the
long
afternoon
shadows
from
the
bordering
trees
fell
across
it
and
no
observers
were
within
sight
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
continued
to
meet
her
mother
's
,
but
she
did
not
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Grandcourt
has
been
saying
something
?
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
dear
.
<EOS>
"
The
last
words
were
uttered
beseechingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
am
I
to
tell
you
,
mamma
?
<EOS>
"
was
the
perverse
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
something
has
agitated
you
.
<EOS>
You
ought
to
confide
in
me
,
Gwen
.
<EOS>
You
ought
not
to
leave
me
in
doubt
and
anxiety
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
's
eyes
filled
with
tears
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mamma
,
dear
,
please
do
n't
be
miserable
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
with
pettish
remonstrance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
only
makes
me
more
so
.
<EOS>
I
am
in
doubt
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
About
Mr.
Grandcourt
's
intentions
?
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
gathering
determination
from
her
alarms
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
not
at
all
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
with
some
curtness
,
and
a
pretty
little
toss
of
the
head
as
she
put
on
her
hat
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
About
whether
you
will
accept
him
,
then
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Precisely
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
given
him
a
doubtful
answer
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
given
him
no
answer
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
_
has
_
spoken
so
that
you
could
not
misunderstand
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
far
as
I
would
let
him
speak
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
expect
him
to
persevere
?
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
put
this
question
rather
anxiously
,
and
receiving
no
answer
,
asked
another
:
"
You
do
n't
consider
that
you
have
discouraged
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
liked
him
,
dear
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
timidly
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
do
,
mamma
,
as
liking
goes
.
<EOS>
There
is
less
to
dislike
about
him
than
about
most
men
.
<EOS>
He
is
quiet
and
_
distingué
_
.
"
<EOS>
Gwendolen
so
far
spoke
with
a
pouting
sort
of
gravity
;
but
suddenly
she
recovered
some
of
her
mischievousness
,
and
her
face
broke
into
a
smile
as
she
added
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
he
has
all
the
qualities
that
would
make
a
husband
tolerable
 
battlement
,
veranda
,
stable
,
etc
.
,
no
grins
and
no
glass
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
be
serious
with
me
for
a
moment
,
dear
.
<EOS>
Am
I
to
understand
that
you
mean
to
accept
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
pray
,
mamma
,
leave
me
to
myself
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
with
a
pettish
distress
in
her
voice
.
  
<EOS>
And
Mrs.
Davilow
said
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
When
they
got
home
Gwendolen
declared
that
she
would
not
dine
.
<EOS>
She
was
tired
,
and
would
come
down
in
the
evening
after
she
had
taken
some
rest
.
<EOS>
The
probability
that
her
uncle
would
hear
what
had
passed
did
not
trouble
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
convinced
that
whatever
he
might
say
would
be
on
the
side
of
her
accepting
Grandcourt
,
and
she
wished
to
accept
him
if
she
could
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
she
would
willingly
have
had
weights
hung
on
her
own
caprice
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
did
hear
 
not
Gwendolen
's
answers
repeated
verbatim
,
but
a
softened
generalized
account
of
them
.
<EOS>
The
mother
conveyed
as
vaguely
as
the
keen
rector
's
questions
would
let
her
the
impression
that
Gwendolen
was
in
some
uncertainty
about
her
own
mind
,
but
inclined
on
the
whole
to
acceptance
.
<EOS>
The
result
was
that
the
uncle
felt
himself
called
on
to
interfere
;
he
did
not
conceive
that
he
should
do
his
duty
in
witholding
direction
from
his
niece
in
a
momentous
crisis
of
this
kind
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
ventured
a
hesitating
opinion
that
perhaps
it
would
be
safer
to
say
nothing
 
<EOS>
Gwendolen
was
so
sensitive
(
she
did
not
like
to
say
willful
)
.
<EOS>
But
the
rector
's
was
a
firm
mind
,
grasping
its
first
judgments
tenaciously
and
acting
on
them
promptly
<EOS>
,
whence
counter
-
judgments
were
no
more
for
him
than
shadows
fleeting
across
the
solid
ground
to
which
he
adjusted
himself
.
  
<EOS>
This
match
with
Grandcourt
presented
itself
to
him
as
a
sort
of
public
affair
;
perhaps
there
were
ways
in
which
it
might
even
strengthen
the
establishment
.
<EOS>
To
the
rector
,
whose
father
(
nobody
would
have
suspected
it
,
and
nobody
was
told
)
had
risen
to
be
a
provincial
corn
-
dealer
,
aristocratic
heirship
resembled
regal
heirship
in
excepting
its
possessor
from
the
ordinary
standard
of
moral
judgments
,
Grandcourt
,
the
almost
certain
baronet
,
the
probable
peer
,
was
to
be
ranged
with
public
personages
,
and
was
a
match
to
be
accepted
on
broad
general
grounds
national
and
ecclesiastical
.
<EOS>
Such
public
personages
,
it
is
true
,
are
often
in
the
nature
of
giants
which
an
ancient
community
may
have
felt
pride
and
safety
in
possessing
,
though
,
regarded
privately
,
these
born
eminences
must
often
have
been
inconvenient
and
even
noisome
.
<EOS>
But
of
the
future
husband
personally
Mr.
Gascoigne
was
disposed
to
think
the
best
.
<EOS>
Gossip
is
a
sort
of
smoke
that
comes
from
the
dirty
tobacco
-
pipes
of
those
who
diffuse
it
:
it
proves
nothing
but
the
bad
taste
of
the
smoker
.
<EOS>
But
if
Grandcourt
had
really
made
any
deeper
or
more
unfortunate
experiments
in
folly
than
were
common
in
young
men
of
high
prospects
,
he
was
of
an
age
to
have
finished
them
.
<EOS>
All
accounts
can
be
suitably
wound
up
when
a
man
has
not
ruined
himself
,
and
the
expense
may
be
taken
as
an
insurance
against
future
error
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
view
of
practical
wisdom
;
with
reference
to
higher
views
,
repentance
had
a
supreme
moral
and
religious
value
.
<EOS>
There
was
every
reason
to
believe
that
a
woman
of
well
-
regulated
mind
would
be
happy
with
Grandcourt
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
no
surprise
to
Gwendolen
on
coming
down
to
tea
to
be
told
that
her
uncle
wished
to
see
her
in
the
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
He
threw
aside
the
paper
as
she
entered
and
greeted
her
with
his
usual
kindness
.
<EOS>
As
his
wife
had
remarked
,
he
always
"
made
much
"
of
Gwendolen
,
and
her
importance
had
risen
of
late
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
fatherly
way
,
moving
a
chair
for
her
as
he
held
her
hand
,
"
I
want
to
speak
to
you
on
a
subject
which
is
more
momentous
than
any
other
with
regard
to
your
welfare
.
<EOS>
You
will
guess
what
I
mean
.
<EOS>
But
I
shall
speak
to
you
with
perfect
directness
:
in
such
matters
I
consider
myself
bound
to
act
as
your
father
.
<EOS>
You
have
no
objection
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
,
no
,
uncle
.
<EOS>
You
have
always
been
very
kind
to
me
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
frankly
.
<EOS>
This
evening
she
was
willing
,
if
it
were
possible
,
to
be
a
little
fortified
against
her
troublesome
self
,
and
her
resistant
temper
was
in
abeyance
.
<EOS>
The
rector
's
mode
of
speech
always
conveyed
a
thrill
of
authority
,
as
of
a
word
of
command
:
it
seemed
to
take
for
granted
that
there
could
be
no
wavering
in
the
audience
,
and
that
every
one
was
going
to
be
rationally
obedient
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
naturally
a
satisfaction
to
me
that
the
prospect
of
a
marriage
for
you
 
advantageous
in
the
highest
degree
 
has
presented
itself
so
early
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
exactly
what
has
passed
between
you
and
Mr.
Grandcourt
,
but
I
presume
there
can
be
little
doubt
,
from
the
way
in
which
he
has
distinguished
you
,
that
he
desires
to
make
you
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
did
not
speak
immediately
,
and
her
uncle
said
with
more
emphasis
    
<EOS>
"
Have
you
any
doubt
of
that
yourself
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
that
is
what
he
has
been
thinking
of
.
<EOS>
But
he
may
have
changed
his
mind
to
-
morrow
,
"
said
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
Has
he
made
advances
which
you
have
discouraged
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
meant
 
he
began
to
make
advances
 
<EOS>
but
I
did
not
encourage
them
.
<EOS>
I
turned
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Will
you
confide
in
me
so
far
as
to
tell
me
your
reasons
?
"
  
"
I
am
not
sure
that
I
had
any
reasons
,
uncle
.
"
<EOS>
Gwendolen
laughed
rather
artificially
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
quite
capable
of
reflecting
,
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
You
are
aware
that
this
is
not
a
trivial
occasion
,
and
it
concerns
your
establishment
for
life
under
circumstances
which
may
not
occur
again
.
<EOS>
You
have
a
duty
here
both
to
yourself
and
your
family
.
<EOS>
I
wish
to
understand
whether
you
have
any
ground
for
hesitating
as
to
your
acceptance
of
Mr.
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
hesitate
without
grounds
.
"
<EOS>
Gwendolen
spoke
rather
poutingly
,
and
her
uncle
grew
suspicious
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
he
disagreeable
to
you
personally
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
heard
anything
of
him
which
has
affected
you
disagreeably
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
rector
thought
it
impossible
that
Gwendolen
could
have
heard
the
gossip
he
had
heard
,
but
in
any
case
he
must
endeavor
to
put
all
things
in
the
right
light
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
nothing
about
him
except
that
he
is
a
great
match
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
with
some
sauciness
;
"
and
that
affects
me
very
agreeably
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
my
dear
Gwendolen
,
I
have
nothing
further
to
say
than
this
:
you
hold
your
fortune
in
your
own
hands
 
a
fortune
such
as
<EOS>
rarely
happens
to
a
girl
in
your
circumstances
 
a
fortune
in
fact
which
almost
takes
the
question
out
of
the
range
of
mere
personal
feeling
,
and
makes
your
acceptance
of
it
a
duty
.
<EOS>
If
Providence
offers
you
power
and
position
 
especially
when
unclogged
by
any
conditions
that
are
repugnant
to
you
 
<EOS>
your
course
is
one
of
responsibility
,
into
which
caprice
must
not
enter
.
<EOS>
A
man
does
not
like
to
have
his
attachment
trifled
with
:
he
may
not
be
at
once
repelled
 
<EOS>
these
things
are
matters
of
individual
disposition
.
<EOS>
But
the
trifling
may
be
carried
too
far
.
<EOS>
And
I
must
point
out
to
you
that
in
case
Mr.
Grandcourt
were
repelled
without
your
having
refused
him
 
without
your
having
intended
ultimately
to
refuse
him
,
your
situation
would
be
a
humiliating
and
painful
one
.
<EOS>
I
,
for
my
part
,
should
regard
you
with
severe
disapprobation
,
as
the
victim
of
nothing
else
than
your
own
coquetry
and
folly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
became
pallid
as
she
listened
to
this
admonitory
speech
.
<EOS>
The
ideas
it
raised
had
the
force
of
sensations
.
<EOS>
Her
resistant
courage
would
not
help
her
here
,
because
her
uncle
was
not
urging
her
against
her
own
resolve
;
he
was
pressing
upon
her
the
motives
of
dread
which
she
already
felt
;
he
was
making
her
more
conscious
of
the
risks
that
lay
within
herself
.
<EOS>
She
was
silent
,
and
the
rector
observed
that
he
had
produced
some
strong
effect
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
this
in
kindness
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
tone
had
softened
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
aware
of
that
,
uncle
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
rising
and
shaking
her
head
back
,
as
if
to
rouse
herself
out
of
painful
passivity
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
foolish
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
I
must
be
married
some
time
 
before
it
is
too
late
.
<EOS>
And
I
do
n't
see
how
I
could
do
better
than
marry
Mr.
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
accept
him
,
if
possible
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
felt
as
if
she
were
reinforcing
herself
by
speaking
with
this
decisiveness
to
her
uncle
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
rector
was
a
little
startled
by
<EOS>
so
bare
a
version
of
his
own
meaning
from
those
young
lips
.
<EOS>
He
wished
that
in
her
mind
his
advice
should
be
taken
in
an
infusion
of
sentiments
proper
to
a
girl
,
and
such
as
are
presupposed
in
the
advice
of
a
clergyman
,
although
he
may
not
consider
them
always
appropriate
to
be
put
forward
.
<EOS>
He
wished
his
niece
parks
,
carriages
,
a
title
 
everything
that
would
make
this
world
a
pleasant
abode
;
but
he
wished
her
not
to
be
cynical
 
to
be
,
on
the
contrary
,
religiously
dutiful
,
and
have
warm
domestic
affections
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Gwendolen
,
"
he
said
,
rising
also
,
and
speaking
with
benignant
gravity
,
"
I
trust
that
you
will
find
in
marriage
a
new
fountain
of
duty
and
affection
.
<EOS>
Marriage
is
the
only
true
and
satisfactory
sphere
of
a
woman
,
and
if
your
marriage
with
Mr.
Grandcourt
should
be
happily
decided
upon
,
you
will
have
,
probably
,
an
increasing
power
,
both
of
rank
and
wealth
,
which
may
be
used
for
the
benefit
of
others
.
<EOS>
These
considerations
are
something
higher
than
romance
!
<EOS>
You
are
fitted
by
natural
gifts
for
a
position
which
,
considering
your
birth
and
early
prospects
,
could
hardly
be
looked
forward
to
as
in
the
ordinary
course
of
things
;
and
I
trust
that
you
will
grace
it
,
not
only
by
those
personal
gifts
,
but
by
a
good
and
consistent
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
mamma
will
be
the
happier
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
in
a
more
cheerful
way
,
lifting
her
hands
backward
to
her
neck
and
moving
toward
the
door
.
<EOS>
She
wanted
to
waive
those
higher
considerations
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
felt
that
he
had
come
to
a
satisfactory
understanding
with
his
niece
,
and
had
furthered
her
happy
settlement
in
life
by
furthering
her
engagement
to
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
there
was
another
person
to
whom
the
contemplation
of
that
issue
had
been
a
motive
for
some
activity
,
and
who
believed
that
he
,
too
,
on
this
particular
day
had
done
something
toward
bringing
about
a
favorable
decision
in
_
his
_
sense
 
which
happened
to
be
the
reverse
of
the
rector
's
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Lush
's
absence
from
Diplow
during
Gwendolen
's
visit
had
been
due
,
not
to
any
fear
on
his
part
of
meeting
that
supercilious
young
lady
,
or
of
being
abashed
by
her
frank
dislike
,
but
to
an
engagement
from
which
he
expected
important
consequences
.
<EOS>
He
was
gone
,
in
fact
,
to
the
Wanchester
station
to
meet
a
lady
,
accompanied
by
a
maid
and
two
children
,
whom
he
put
into
a
fly
,
and
afterward
followed
to
the
hotel
of
the
Golden
Keys
,
in
that
town
.
<EOS>
An
impressive
woman
,
whom
many
would
turn
to
look
at
again
in
passing
;
her
figure
was
slim
and
sufficiently
tall
,
her
face
rather
emaciated
,
so
that
its
sculpturesque
beauty
was
the
more
pronounced
,
her
crisp
hair
perfectly
black
,
and
her
large
,
anxious
eyes
<EOS>
what
we
call
black
.
<EOS>
Her
dress
was
soberly
correct
,
her
age
,
perhaps
,
physically
more
advanced
than
the
number
of
years
would
imply
,
but
hardly
less
than
seven
-
and
-
thirty
.
<EOS>
An
uneasy
-
looking
woman
:
her
glance
seemed
to
presuppose
that
the
people
and
things
were
going
to
be
unfavorable
to
her
,
while
she
was
,
nevertheless
,
ready
to
meet
them
with
resolution
.
<EOS>
The
children
were
lovely
 
a
dark
-
haired
girl
of
six
or
more
,
a
fairer
boy
of
five
.
<EOS>
When
Lush
incautiously
expressed
some
surprise
at
her
having
brought
the
children
,
she
said
,
with
a
sharp
-
toned
intonation
    
"
Did
you
suppose
I
should
come
wandering
about
here
by
myself
?
<EOS>
Why
should
I
not
bring
all
four
if
I
liked
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
certainly
,
"
said
Lush
,
with
his
usual
fluent
_
nonchalance
_
.
  
<EOS>
He
stayed
an
hour
or
so
in
conference
with
her
,
and
rode
back
to
Diplow
in
a
state
of
mind
that
was
at
once
hopeful
and
busily
anxious
as
to
the
execution
of
the
little
plan
on
which
his
hopefulness
was
based
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
's
marriage
to
Gwendolen
Harleth
would
not
,
he
believed
,
be
much
of
a
good
to
either
of
them
,
and
it
would
plainly
be
fraught
with
disagreeables
to
himself
.
<EOS>
But
now
he
felt
confident
enough
to
say
inwardly
,
"
I
will
take
,
nay
,
I
will
lay
odds
that
the
marriage
will
never
happen
.
<EOS>
"
      
<EOS>
I
will
not
clothe
myself
in
wreck
 
<EOS>
wear
gems
  
<EOS>
Sawed
from
cramped
finger
-
bones
of
women
drowned
;
  
Feel
chilly
vaporous
hands
of
ireful
ghosts
  
<EOS>
Clutching
my
necklace
:
trick
my
maiden
breast
  
With
orphans
'
heritage
.
<EOS>
Let
your
dead
love
  
Marry
<EOS>
it
's
dead
.
   
<EOS>
Gwendolen
looked
lovely
and
vigorous
as
a
tall
,
newly
-
opened
lily
the
next
morning
:
there
was
a
reaction
of
young
energy
in
her
,
and
yesterday
's
self
-
distrust
seemed
no
more
than
the
transient
shiver
on
the
surface
of
a
full
stream
.
<EOS>
The
roving
archery
match
in
Cardell
Chase
was
a
delightful
prospect
for
the
sport
's
sake
<EOS>
:
she
felt
herself
beforehand
moving
about
like
a
wood
-
nymph
under
the
beeches
(
in
appreciative
company
)
,
and
the
imagined
scene
lent
a
charm
to
further
advances
on
the
part
of
Grandcourt
 
not
an
impassioned
lyrical
Daphnis
for
the
wood
-
nymph
,
certainly
:
but
so
much
the
better
.
<EOS>
To
-
day
Gwendolen
foresaw
him
making
slow
conversational
approaches
to
a
declaration
,
and
foresaw
herself
awaiting
and
encouraging
it
according
to
the
rational
conclusion
which
she
had
expressed
to
her
uncle
.
  
<EOS>
When
she
came
down
to
breakfast
(
after
every
one
had
left
the
table
except
Mrs.
Davilow
)
there
were
letters
on
her
plate
.
<EOS>
One
of
them
she
read
with
a
gathering
smile
,
and
then
handed
it
to
her
mamma
,
who
,
on
returning
it
,
smiled
also
,
finding
new
cheerfulness
in
the
good
spirits
her
daughter
had
shown
ever
since
waking
,
and
said
    
"
You
do
n't
feel
inclined
to
go
a
thousand
miles
away
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
exactly
so
far
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
sad
omission
not
to
have
written
again
before
this
.
<EOS>
Ca
n't
you
write
how
 
before
we
set
out
this
morning
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
so
pressing
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
will
do
.
<EOS>
You
see
they
leave
town
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
I
must
write
to
Dover
.
<EOS>
They
will
be
there
till
Monday
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Shall
I
write
for
you
,
dear
 
if
it
teases
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
did
not
speak
immediately
,
but
after
sipping
her
coffee
,
answered
brusquely
,
"
Oh
no
,
let
it
be
;
I
will
write
to
-
morrow
.
"
<EOS>
Then
,
feeling
a
touch
of
compunction
,
she
looked
up
and
said
with
playful
tenderness
,
"
Dear
,
old
,
beautiful
mamma
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Old
,
child
,
truly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Please
do
n't
,
mamma
!
<EOS>
I
meant
old
for
darling
.
<EOS>
You
are
hardly
twenty
-
five
years
older
than
I
am
.
<EOS>
When
you
talk
in
that
way
my
life
shrivels
up
before
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
One
can
have
a
great
deal
of
happiness
in
twenty
-
five
years
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
lose
no
time
in
beginning
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
merrily
.
<EOS>
"
The
sooner
I
get
my
palaces
and
coaches
the
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
a
good
husband
who
adores
you
,
Gwen
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
encouragingly
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
put
out
her
lips
saucily
and
said
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
slight
drawback
on
her
pleasure
in
starting
that
the
rector
was
detained
by
magistrate
's
business
,
and
would
probably
not
be
able
to
get
to
Cardell
Chase
at
all
that
day
.
<EOS>
She
cared
little
that
Mrs.
Gascoigne
and
Anna
chose
not
to
go
without
him
,
but
her
uncle
's
presence
would
have
seemed
to
make
it
a
matter
of
course
that
the
decision
taken
would
be
acted
on
.
<EOS>
For
decision
in
itself
began
to
be
formidable
.
<EOS>
Having
come
close
to
accepting
Grandcourt
,
Gwendolen
felt
this
lot
of
unhoped
-
for
fullness
rounding
itself
too
definitely
.
<EOS>
When
we
take
to
wishing
a
great
deal
for
ourselves
,
whatever
we
get
soon
turns
into
mere
limitation
and
exclusion
.
<EOS>
Still
there
was
the
reassuring
thought
that
marriage
would
be
the
gate
into
a
larger
freedom
.
  
<EOS>
The
place
of
meeting
was
a
grassy
spot
called
Green
Arbor
,
where
a
bit
of
hanging
wood
made
a
sheltering
amphitheatre
.
<EOS>
It
was
here
that
the
coachful
of
servants
with
provisions
had
to
prepare
the
picnic
meal
;
and
the
warden
of
the
Chase
was
to
guide
the
roving
archers
so
as
to
keep
them
within
the
due
distance
from
this
centre
,
and
hinder
them
from
wandering
beyond
the
limit
which
had
been
fixed
on
 
a
curve
that
might
be
drawn
through
certain
well
-
known
points
,
such
as
the
double
Oak
,
the
Whispering
Stones
,
and
the
High
Cross
.
<EOS>
The
plan
was
to
take
only
a
preliminary
stroll
before
luncheon
,
keeping
the
main
roving
expedition
for
the
more
exquisite
lights
of
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
The
muster
was
rapid
enough
to
save
every
one
from
dull
moments
of
waiting
,
and
when
the
groups
began
to
scatter
themselves
through
the
light
and
shadow
made
here
by
closely
neighboring
beeches
and
there
by
rarer
oaks
,
one
may
suppose
that
a
painter
would
have
been
glad
to
look
on
.
<EOS>
This
roving
archery
was
far
prettier
than
the
stationary
game
,
but
success
in
shooting
at
variable
marks
were
less
favored
by
practice
,
and
the
hits
were
distributed
among
the
volunteer
archers
otherwise
than
they
would
have
been
in
target
-
shooting
.
<EOS>
From
this
cause
,
perhaps
,
as
well
as
from
the
twofold
distraction
of
being
preoccupied
and
wishing
not
to
betray
her
preoccupation
,
Gwendolen
did
not
greatly
distinguish
herself
in
these
first
experiments
,
unless
it
were
by
the
lively
grace
with
which
she
took
her
comparative
failure
.
<EOS>
She
was
in
white
and
green
as
on
the
day
of
the
former
meeting
,
when
it
made
an
epoch
for
her
that
she
was
introduced
to
Grandcourt
;
he
was
continually
by
her
side
now
,
yet
it
would
have
been
hard
to
tell
from
mere
looks
and
manners
that
their
relation
to
each
other
had
at
all
changed
since
their
first
conversation
.
<EOS>
Still
there
were
other
grounds
that
made
most
persons
conclude
them
to
be
,
if
not
engaged
already
,
on
the
eve
of
being
so
.
<EOS>
And
she
believed
this
herself
.
<EOS>
As
they
were
all
returning
toward
Green
Arbor
in
divergent
groups
,
not
thinking
at
all
of
taking
aim
but
merely
chattering
,
words
passed
which
seemed
really
the
beginning
of
that
end
 
the
beginning
of
her
acceptance
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
said
,
"
Do
you
know
how
long
it
is
since
I
first
saw
you
in
this
dress
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
archery
meeting
was
on
the
25th
,
and
this
is
the
13th
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
laughingly
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
good
at
calculating
,
but
I
will
venture
to
say
that
it
must
be
nearly
three
weeks
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
A
little
pause
,
and
then
he
said
,
"
That
is
a
great
loss
of
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
your
knowing
me
has
caused
you
?
<EOS>
Pray
do
n't
be
uncomplimentary
;
I
do
n't
like
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Pause
again
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
because
of
the
gain
that
I
feel
the
loss
.
"
  
<EOS>
Here
Gwendolen
herself
let
a
pause
.
<EOS>
She
was
thinking
,
"
He
is
really
very
ingenious
.
<EOS>
He
never
speaks
stupidly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
silence
was
so
unusual
that
it
seemed
the
strongest
of
favorable
answers
,
and
he
continued
:
  
<EOS>
"
The
gain
of
knowing
you
makes
me
feel
the
time
I
lose
in
uncertainty
.
<EOS>
Do
_
<EOS>
you
<EOS>
_
like
uncertainty
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
do
,
rather
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
suddenly
beaming
on
him
with
a
playful
smile
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
more
in
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
met
her
laughing
eyes
with
a
slow
,
steady
look
right
into
them
,
which
seemed
like
vision
in
the
abstract
,
and
then
said
,
"
Do
you
mean
more
torment
for
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
something
so
strange
to
Gwendolen
in
this
moment
that
she
was
quite
shaken
out
of
her
usual
self
-
consciousness
.
<EOS>
Blushing
and
turning
away
her
eyes
,
she
said
,
"
No
,
that
would
make
me
sorry
.
"
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
would
have
followed
up
this
answer
,
which
the
change
in
her
manner
made
apparently
decisive
of
her
favorable
intention
;
but
he
was
not
in
any
way
overcome
so
as
to
be
unaware
that
they
were
now
,
within
sight
of
everybody
,
descending
the
space
into
Green
Arbor
,
and
descending
it
at
an
ill
-
chosen
point
where
it
began
to
be
inconveniently
steep
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
reason
for
offering
his
hand
in
the
literal
sense
to
help
her
;
she
took
it
,
and
they
came
down
in
silence
,
much
observed
by
those
already
on
the
level
 
among
others
by
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
,
who
happened
to
be
standing
with
Mrs.
Davilow
.
<EOS>
That
lady
had
now
made
up
her
mind
that
Grandcourt
's
merits
were
not
such
as
would
have
induced
Catherine
to
accept
him
,
Catherine
having
so
high
a
standard
as
to
have
refused
Lord
Slogan
.
<EOS>
Hence
she
looked
at
the
tenant
of
Diplow
with
dispassionate
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Grandcourt
is
not
equal
as
a
man
to
his
uncle
,
Sir
Hugo
Mallinger
 
too
languid
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
Mr.
Grandcourt
is
a
much
younger
man
,
but
I
should
n't
wonder
if
Sir
Hugo
were
to
outlive
him
,
notwithstanding
the
difference
of
years
.
<EOS>
It
is
ill
calculating
on
successions
,
"
concluded
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
,
rather
too
loudly
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
indeed
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
able
to
assent
with
quiet
cheerfulness
,
for
she
was
so
well
satisfied
with
the
actual
situation
of
affairs
that
her
habitual
melancholy
in
their
general
unsatisfactoriness
was
altogether
in
abeyance
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
not
concerned
to
tell
of
the
food
that
was
eaten
in
that
green
refectory
,
or
even
to
dwell
on
the
stories
of
the
forest
scenery
that
spread
themselves
out
beyond
the
level
front
of
the
hollow
;
being
just
now
bound
to
tell
a
story
of
life
at
a
stage
when
the
blissful
beauty
of
earth
and
sky
entered
only
by
narrow
and
oblique
inlets
into
the
consciousness
,
which
was
busy
with
a
small
social
drama
almost
as
little
penetrated
by
a
feeling
of
wider
relations
as
if
it
had
been
a
puppet
-
show
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
understood
that
the
food
and
champagne
were
of
the
best
 
the
talk
and
laughter
too
,
in
the
sense
of
belonging
to
the
best
society
,
where
no
one
makes
an
invidious
display
of
anything
in
particular
,
and
the
advantages
of
the
world
are
taken
with
that
high
-
bred
depreciation
which
follows
from
being
accustomed
to
them
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
gentlemen
strolled
a
little
and
indulged
in
a
cigar
,
there
being
a
sufficient
interval
before
,
four
o'clock
 
<EOS>
the
time
for
beginning
to
rove
again
.
<EOS>
Among
these
,
strange
to
say
,
was
Grandcourt
;
but
not
Mr.
Lush
,
who
seemed
to
be
taking
his
pleasure
quite
generously
to
-
day
by
making
himself
particularly
serviceable
,
ordering
everything
for
everybody
,
and
by
this
activity
becoming
more
than
ever
a
blot
on
the
scene
to
Gwendolen
,
though
he
kept
himself
amiably
aloof
from
her
,
and
never
even
looked
at
her
obviously
.
<EOS>
When
there
was
a
general
move
to
prepare
for
starting
,
it
appeared
that
the
bows
had
all
been
put
under
the
charge
of
Lord
Brackenshaw
's
valet
,
and
Mr.
Lush
was
concerned
to
save
ladies
the
trouble
of
fetching
theirs
from
the
carriage
where
they
were
propped
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
intend
to
bring
Gwendolen
's
,
but
she
,
fearful
lest
he
should
do
so
,
hurried
to
fetch
it
herself
.
<EOS>
The
valet
,
seeing
her
approach
,
met
her
with
it
,
and
in
giving
it
into
her
hand
gave
also
a
letter
addressed
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
asked
no
question
about
it
,
perceived
at
a
glance
that
the
address
was
in
a
lady
's
handwriting
(
of
the
delicate
kind
which
used
to
be
esteemed
feminine
before
the
present
uncial
period
)
,
and
moving
away
with
her
bow
in
her
hand
,
saw
Mr.
Lush
coming
to
fetch
other
bows
.
<EOS>
To
avoid
meeting
him
she
turned
aside
and
walked
with
her
back
toward
the
stand
of
carriages
,
opening
the
letter
.
<EOS>
It
contained
these
words
        
<EOS>
If
Miss
Harleth
is
in
doubt
whether
she
should
accept
Mr.
Grandcourt
,
    
let
her
break
from
her
party
after
they
have
passed
the
Whispering
    
Stones
and
return
to
that
spot
.
<EOS>
She
will
then
hear
something
to
decide
    
her
;
but
she
can
only
hear
it
by
keeping
this
letter
a
strict
secret
    
from
every
one
.
<EOS>
If
she
does
not
act
according
to
this
letter
,
she
will
    
repent
,
as
the
woman
who
writes
it
has
repented
.
<EOS>
The
secrecy
Miss
    
Harleth
will
feel
herself
bound
in
honor
to
guard
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
felt
an
inward
shock
,
but
her
immediate
thought
was
,
"
It
is
come
in
time
.
<EOS>
"
It
lay
in
her
youthfulness
that
she
was
absorbed
by
the
idea
of
the
revelation
to
be
made
,
and
had
not
even
a
momentary
suspicion
of
contrivance
that
could
justify
her
in
showing
the
letter
.
<EOS>
Her
mind
gathered
itself
up
at
once
into
the
resolution
,
that
she
would
manage
to
go
unobserved
to
the
Whispering
Stones
;
and
thrusting
the
letter
into
her
pocket
she
turned
back
to
rejoin
the
company
,
with
that
sense
of
having
something
to
conceal
which
to
her
nature
had
a
bracing
quality
and
helped
her
to
be
mistress
of
herself
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
surprise
to
every
one
that
Grandcourt
was
not
,
like
the
other
smokers
,
on
the
spot
in
time
to
set
out
roving
with
the
rest
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
alight
on
him
by
-
and
-
by
,
"
said
Lord
Brackenshaw
;
"
he
ca
n't
be
gone
far
.
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
,
no
man
could
be
waited
for
.
<EOS>
This
apparent
forgetfulness
might
be
taken
for
the
distraction
of
a
lover
so
absorbed
in
thinking
of
the
beloved
object
as
to
forget
an
appointment
which
would
bring
him
into
her
actual
presence
.
<EOS>
And
the
good
-
natured
Earl
gave
Gwendolen
a
distant
jocose
hint
to
that
effect
,
which
she
took
with
suitable
quietude
.
<EOS>
But
the
thought
in
her
mind
was
"
Can
he
too
be
starting
away
from
a
decision
?
<EOS>
"
It
was
not
exactly
a
pleasant
thought
to
her
;
but
it
was
near
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
Starting
away
,
"
however
,
was
not
the
right
expression
for
the
languor
of
intention
that
came
over
Grandcourt
,
like
a
fit
of
diseased
numbness
,
when
an
end
seemed
within
easy
reach
:
to
desist
then
,
when
all
expectation
was
to
the
contrary
,
became
another
gratification
of
mere
will
,
sublimely
independent
of
definite
motive
.
<EOS>
At
that
moment
he
had
begun
a
second
large
cigar
in
a
vague
,
hazy
obstinacy
which
,
if
Lush
or
any
other
mortal
who
might
be
insulted
with
impunity
had
interrupted
by
overtaking
him
with
a
request
for
his
return
,
would
have
expressed
itself
by
a
slow
removal
of
his
cigar
,
to
say
in
an
undertone
,
"
You
'll
be
kind
enough
to
go
to
the
devil
,
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
But
he
was
not
interrupted
,
and
the
rovers
set
off
without
any
visible
depression
of
spirits
,
leaving
behind
only
a
few
of
the
less
vigorous
ladies
,
including
Mrs.
Davilow
,
who
preferred
a
quiet
stroll
free
from
obligation
to
keep
up
with
others
.
<EOS>
The
enjoyment
of
the
day
was
soon
at
its
highest
pitch
,
the
archery
getting
more
spirited
and
the
changing
scenes
of
the
forest
from
roofed
grove
to
open
glade
growing
lovelier
with
the
lengthening
shadows
,
and
the
deeply
-
felt
but
undefinable
gradations
of
the
mellowing
afternoon
.
<EOS>
It
was
agreed
that
they
were
playing
an
extemporized
"
As
you
like
it
;
"
and
when
a
pretty
compliment
had
been
turned
to
Gwendolen
about
her
having
the
part
of
Rosalind
,
she
felt
the
more
compelled
to
be
surpassing
in
loveliness
.
<EOS>
This
was
not
very
difficult
to
her
,
for
the
effect
of
what
had
happened
to
-
day
was
an
excitement
which
needed
a
vent
 
a
sense
of
adventure
rather
than
alarm
,
and
a
straining
toward
the
management
of
her
retreat
,
so
as
not
to
be
impeded
.
  
<EOS>
The
roving
had
been
lasting
nearly
an
hour
before
the
arrival
at
the
Whispering
Stones
,
two
tall
conical
blocks
that
leaned
toward
each
other
like
gigantic
gray
-
mantled
figures
.
<EOS>
They
were
soon
surveyed
and
passed
by
with
the
remark
that
they
would
be
good
ghosts
on
a
starlit
night
.
<EOS>
But
a
soft
sunlight
was
on
them
now
,
and
Gwendolen
felt
daring
.
<EOS>
The
stones
were
near
a
fine
grove
of
beeches
,
where
the
archers
found
plenty
of
marks
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
far
are
we
from
Green
Arbor
now
?
"
said
Gwendolen
,
having
got
in
front
by
the
side
of
the
warden
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
not
more
than
half
a
mile
,
taking
along
the
avenue
we
're
going
to
cross
up
there
:
<EOS>
but
I
shall
take
round
a
Couple
of
miles
,
by
the
High
Cross
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
falling
back
among
the
rest
,
when
suddenly
they
seemed
all
to
be
hurrying
obliquely
forward
under
the
guidance
of
Mr.
Lush
,
and
lingering
a
little
where
she
was
,
she
perceived
her
opportunity
of
slipping
away
.
<EOS>
Soon
she
was
out
of
sight
,
and
without
running
she
seemed
to
herself
to
fly
along
the
ground
and
count
the
moments
nothing
till
she
found
herself
back
again
at
the
Whispering
Stones
.
<EOS>
They
turned
their
blank
gray
sides
to
her
:
what
was
there
on
the
other
side
?
<EOS>
If
there
were
nothing
after
all
?
<EOS>
That
was
her
only
dread
now
 
to
have
to
turn
back
again
in
mystification
;
and
walking
round
the
right
-
hand
stone
without
pause
,
she
found
herself
in
front
of
some
one
whose
large
dark
eyes
met
hers
at
a
foot
's
distance
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
expectation
,
she
was
startled
and
shrank
bank
,
but
in
doing
so
she
could
take
in
the
whole
figure
of
this
stranger
and
perceive
that
she
was
unmistakably
a
lady
,
and
one
who
must
have
been
exceedingly
handsome
.
<EOS>
She
perceived
,
also
,
that
a
few
yards
from
her
were
two
children
seated
on
the
grass
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Harleth
?
"
said
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
<EOS>
"
All
Gwendolen
's
consciousness
was
wonder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
accepted
Mr.
Grandcourt
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
promised
to
tell
you
something
.
<EOS>
And
you
will
promise
to
keep
my
secret
.
<EOS>
However
you
may
decide
you
will
not
tell
Mr.
Grandcourt
,
or
any
one
else
,
that
you
have
seen
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
promise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
name
is
Lydia
Glasher
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grandcourt
ought
not
to
marry
any
one
but
me
.
<EOS>
I
left
my
husband
and
child
for
him
nine
years
ago
.
<EOS>
Those
two
children
are
his
,
and
we
have
two
others
 
girls
 
who
are
older
.
<EOS>
My
husband
is
dead
now
,
and
Mr.
Grandcourt
ought
to
marry
me
.
<EOS>
He
ought
to
make
that
boy
his
heir
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
at
the
boy
as
she
spoke
,
and
Gwendolen
's
eyes
followed
hers
.
<EOS>
The
handsome
little
fellow
was
puffing
out
his
cheeks
in
trying
to
blow
a
tiny
trumpet
which
remained
dumb
.
<EOS>
His
hat
hung
backward
by
a
string
,
and
his
brown
curls
caught
the
sun
-
rays
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
cherub
.
  
<EOS>
The
two
women
's
eyes
met
again
,
and
Gwendolen
said
proudly
,
"
I
will
not
interfere
with
your
wishes
.
"
<EOS>
She
looked
as
if
she
were
shivering
,
and
her
lips
were
pale
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
attractive
,
Miss
Harleth
.
<EOS>
But
when
he
first
knew
me
,
I
too
was
young
.
<EOS>
Since
then
my
life
has
been
broken
up
and
embittered
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
fair
that
he
should
be
happy
and
I
miserable
,
and
my
boy
thrust
out
of
sight
for
another
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
These
words
were
uttered
with
a
biting
accent
,
but
with
a
determined
abstinence
from
anything
violent
in
tone
or
manner
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
watching
Mrs.
Glasher
's
face
while
she
spoke
,
felt
a
sort
of
terror
:
it
was
as
if
some
ghastly
vision
had
come
to
her
in
a
dream
and
said
,
"
I
am
a
woman
's
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
anything
more
to
say
to
me
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
in
a
low
tone
,
but
still
proud
and
coldly
.
<EOS>
The
revulsion
within
her
was
not
tending
to
soften
her
.
<EOS>
Everyone
seemed
hateful
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
.
<EOS>
You
know
what
I
wished
you
to
know
.
<EOS>
You
can
inquire
about
me
if
you
like
.
<EOS>
My
husband
was
Colonel
Glasher
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
will
go
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
moving
away
with
a
ceremonious
inclination
,
which
was
returned
with
equal
grace
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
Gwendolen
was
in
the
beech
grove
again
but
her
party
had
gone
out
of
sight
and
apparently
had
not
sent
in
search
of
her
,
for
all
was
solitude
till
she
had
reached
the
avenue
pointed
out
by
the
warden
.
<EOS>
She
determined
to
take
this
way
back
to
Green
Arbor
,
which
she
reached
quickly
;
rapid
movements
seeming
to
her
just
now
a
means
of
suspending
the
thoughts
which
might
prevent
her
from
behaving
with
due
calm
.
<EOS>
She
had
already
made
up
her
mind
<EOS>
what
step
she
would
take
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
was
of
course
astonished
to
see
Gwendolen
returning
alone
,
and
was
not
without
some
uneasiness
which
the
presence
of
other
ladies
hindered
her
from
showing
.
<EOS>
In
answer
to
her
words
of
surprise
Gwendolen
<EOS>
said
    
"
Oh
,
I
have
been
rather
silly
.
<EOS>
I
lingered
behind
to
look
at
the
Whispering
Stones
,
and
the
rest
hurried
on
after
something
,
<EOS>
so
I
lost
sight
of
them
.
<EOS>
I
thought
it
best
to
come
home
by
the
short
way
 
the
avenue
that
the
warden
had
told
me
of
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
sorry
after
all
.
<EOS>
I
had
had
enough
walking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
party
did
not
meet
Mr.
Grandcourt
,
I
presume
,
"
said
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
,
not
without
intention
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
with
a
little
flash
of
defiance
,
and
a
light
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
And
we
did
n't
see
any
carvings
on
the
trees
,
either
.
<EOS>
Where
can
he
be
?
<EOS>
I
should
think
he
has
fallen
into
the
pool
or
had
an
apoplectic
fit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
all
Gwendolen
's
resolve
not
to
betray
any
agitation
,
she
could
not
help
it
that
her
tone
was
unusually
high
and
hard
,
and
her
mother
felt
sure
that
something
unpropitious
had
happened
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
thought
that
the
self
-
confident
young
lady
was
much
piqued
,
and
that
Mr.
Grandcourt
was
probably
seeing
reason
to
change
his
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
have
no
objection
,
mamma
,
I
will
order
the
carriage
,
"
said
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
tired
.
<EOS>
And
every
one
will
be
going
soon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
assented
;
but
by
the
time
the
carriage
was
announced
as
,
ready
 
the
horses
having
to
be
fetched
from
the
stables
on
the
warden
's
premises
 
the
roving
party
reappeared
,
and
with
them
Mr.
Grandcourt
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
there
you
are
!
"
said
Lord
Brackenshaw
,
going
up
to
Gwendolen
,
who
was
arranging
her
mamma
's
shawl
for
the
drive
.
<EOS>
"
We
thought
at
first
you
had
alighted
on
Grandcourt
and
he
had
taken
you
home
.
<EOS>
Lush
said
so
.
<EOS>
But
after
that
we
met
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
However
,
we
did
n't
suppose
you
could
be
in
any
danger
.
<EOS>
The
warden
said
he
had
told
you
a
near
way
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
going
?
"
said
Grandcourt
,
coming
up
with
his
usual
air
,
as
if
he
did
not
conceive
that
there
had
been
any
omission
on
his
part
.
<EOS>
Lord
Brackenshaw
gave
place
to
him
and
moved
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
we
are
going
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
looking
busily
at
her
scarf
,
which
she
was
arranging
across
her
shoulders
Scotch
fashion
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
call
at
Offendene
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
yes
,
if
you
like
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
sweeping
him
from
a
distance
with
her
eyelashes
.
<EOS>
Her
voice
was
light
and
sharp
as
the
first
touch
of
frost
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
accepted
his
arm
to
lead
her
to
the
carriage
;
but
while
that
was
happening
,
Gwendolen
with
incredible
swiftness
had
got
in
advance
of
them
,
and
had
sprung
into
the
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
got
in
,
mamma
,
because
I
wished
to
be
on
this
side
,
"
she
said
,
apologetically
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
avoided
Grandcourt
's
touch
:
he
only
lifted
his
hat
and
walked
away
 
with
the
not
unsatisfactory
impression
that
she
meant
to
show
herself
offended
by
his
neglect
.
  
<EOS>
The
mother
and
daughter
drove
for
five
minutes
in
silence
.
<EOS>
Then
Gwendolen
said
,
"
I
intend
to
join
the
Langens
at
Dover
,
mamma
.
<EOS>
I
shall
pack
up
immediately
on
getting
home
,
and
set
off
by
the
early
train
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
at
Dover
almost
as
soon
as
they
are
;
we
can
let
them
know
by
telegraph
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
heavens
,
child
!
<EOS>
what
can
be
your
reason
for
saying
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
reason
for
saying
it
,
mamma
,
is
that
I
mean
to
do
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
why
do
you
mean
to
do
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
go
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
because
you
are
offended
with
Mr.
Grandcourt
's
odd
behavior
in
walking
off
to
-
day
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
useless
to
enter
into
such
questions
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
going
in
any
case
to
marry
Mr.
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
interest
yourself
further
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
can
I
say
to
your
uncle
,
Gwendolen
?
<EOS>
Consider
the
position
you
place
me
in
.
<EOS>
You
led
him
to
believe
only
last
night
that
you
had
made
up
your
mind
in
favor
of
Mr.
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
sorry
to
cause
you
annoyance
,
mamma
,
dear
,
but
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
help
it
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
with
still
harder
resistance
in
her
tone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Whatever
you
or
my
uncle
may
think
or
do
,
I
shall
not
alter
my
resolve
,
and
I
shall
not
tell
my
reason
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
care
what
comes
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
care
if
I
never
marry
any
one
.
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
worth
caring
for
.
<EOS>
I
believe
all
men
are
bad
,
and
I
hate
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
need
you
set
off
in
this
way
,
Gwendolen
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
miserable
and
helpless
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
mamma
,
do
n't
interfere
with
me
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
ever
had
any
trouble
in
your
own
life
,
remember
it
and
do
n't
interfere
with
me
.
<EOS>
If
I
am
to
be
miserable
,
let
it
be
by
my
own
choice
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
mother
was
reduced
to
trembling
silence
.
<EOS>
She
began
to
see
that
the
difficulty
would
be
lessened
if
Gwendolen
went
away
.
  
<EOS>
And
she
did
go
.
<EOS>
The
packing
was
all
carefully
done
that
evening
,
and
not
long
after
dawn
the
next
day
Mrs.
Davilow
accompanied
her
daughter
to
the
railway
station
.
<EOS>
The
sweet
dews
of
morning
,
the
cows
and
horses
looking
over
the
hedges
without
any
particular
reason
,
the
early
travelers
on
foot
with
their
bundles
,
seemed
all
very
melancholy
and
purposeless
to
them
both
.
<EOS>
The
dingy
torpor
of
the
railway
station
,
before
the
ticket
could
be
taken
,
was
still
worse
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
had
certainly
hardened
in
the
last
twenty
-
four
hours
:
her
mother
's
trouble
evidently
counted
for
little
in
her
present
state
of
mind
,
which
did
not
essentially
differ
from
the
mood
that
makes
men
take
to
worse
conduct
when
their
belief
in
persons
or
things
is
upset
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
uncontrolled
reading
,
though
consisting
chiefly
in
what
are
called
pictures
of
life
,
had
somehow
not
prepared
her
for
this
encounter
with
reality
.
<EOS>
Is
that
surprising
?
<EOS>
It
is
to
be
believed
that
attendance
at
the
_
opéra
bouffe
_
in
the
present
day
would
not
leave
men
's
minds
entirely
without
shock
,
if
the
manners
observed
there
with
some
applause
were
suddenly
to
start
up
in
their
own
families
.
<EOS>
Perspective
,
as
its
inventor
remarked
,
is
a
beautiful
thing
.
<EOS>
What
horrors
of
damp
huts
,
where
human
beings
languish
,
may
not
become
picturesque
through
aerial
distance
!
<EOS>
What
hymning
of
cancerous
vices
may
we
not
languish
over
as
sublimest
art
in
the
safe
remoteness
of
a
strange
language
and
artificial
phrase
!
<EOS>
Yet
we
keep
a
repugnance
to
rheumatism
and
other
painful
effects
when
presented
incur
personal
experience
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
felt
Gwendolen
's
new
phase
of
indifference
keenly
,
and
as
she
drove
back
alone
,
the
brightening
morning
was
sadder
to
her
than
before
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Grandcourt
called
that
day
at
Offendene
,
but
nobody
was
at
home
.
        
<EOS>
"
_
Festina
lente
<EOS>
_
 
celerity
should
be
contempered
with
    
cunctation

"
 
<EOS>
SIR
THOMAS
BROWNE
.
   
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
we
have
seen
,
passed
her
time
abroad
in
the
new
excitement
of
gambling
,
and
in
imagining
herself
an
empress
of
luck
,
having
brought
from
her
late
experience
a
vague
impression
that
in
this
confused
world
it
signified
nothing
what
any
one
did
,
so
that
they
amused
themselves
.
<EOS>
We
have
seen
,
too
,
that
certain
persons
,
mysteriously
symbolized
as
Grapnell
&
Co.
,
having
also
thought
of
reigning
in
the
realm
of
luck
,
and
being
also
bent
on
amusing
themselves
,
no
matter
how
,
had
brought
about
a
painful
change
in
her
family
circumstances
;
whence
she
had
returned
home
 
carrying
with
her
,
against
her
inclination
,
a
necklace
which
she
had
pawned
and
some
one
else
had
redeemed
.
  
<EOS>
While
she
was
going
back
to
England
,
Grandcourt
was
coming
to
find
her
;
coming
,
that
is
,
after
his
own
manner
 
not
in
haste
by
express
straight
from
Diplow
to
Leubronn
,
where
she
was
understood
to
be
;
but
so
entirely
without
hurry
that
he
was
induced
by
the
presence
of
some
Russian
acquaintances
to
linger
at
Baden
-
Baden
and
make
various
appointments
with
them
,
which
,
however
,
his
desire
to
be
at
Leubronn
ultimately
caused
him
to
break
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
's
passions
were
of
the
intermittent
,
flickering
kind
:
never
flaming
out
strongly
.
<EOS>
But
a
great
deal
of
life
goes
on
without
strong
passion
:
myriads
of
cravats
are
carefully
tied
,
dinners
attended
,
<EOS>
even
speeches
made
proposing
the
health
of
august
personages
without
the
zest
arising
from
a
strong
desire
.
<EOS>
And
a
man
may
make
a
good
appearance
in
high
social
positions
 
may
be
supposed
to
know
the
classics
,
to
have
his
reserves
on
science
,
a
strong
though
repressed
opinion
on
politics
,
and
all
the
sentiments
of
the
English
gentleman
,
at
a
small
expense
of
vital
energy
.
<EOS>
Also
,
he
may
be
obstinate
or
persistent
at
the
same
low
rate
,
and
may
even
show
sudden
impulses
which
have
a
false
air
of
daemonic
strength
because
they
seem
inexplicable
,
though
perhaps
their
secret
lies
merely
in
the
want
of
regulated
channels
for
the
soul
to
move
in
 
good
and
sufficient
ducts
of
habit
without
which
our
nature
easily
turns
to
mere
ooze
and
mud
,
and
at
any
pressure
yields
nothing
but
a
spurt
or
a
puddle
.
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
had
not
been
altogether
displeased
by
Gwendolen
's
running
away
from
the
splendid
chance
he
was
holding
out
to
her
.
<EOS>
The
act
had
some
piquancy
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
liked
to
think
that
it
was
due
to
resentment
of
his
careless
behavior
in
Cardell
Chase
,
which
,
when
he
came
to
consider
it
,
did
appear
rather
cool
.
<EOS>
To
have
brought
her
so
near
a
tender
admission
,
and
then
to
have
walked
headlong
away
from
further
opportunities
of
winning
the
consent
which
he
had
made
her
understand
him
to
be
asking
for
,
was
enough
to
provoke
a
girl
of
spirit
;
and
to
be
worth
<EOS>
his
mastering
<EOS>
it
was
proper
that
she
should
have
some
spirit
.
<EOS>
Doubtless
she
meant
him
to
follow
her
,
and
it
was
what
he
meant
too
.
<EOS>
But
for
a
whole
week
he
took
no
measures
toward
starting
,
and
did
not
even
inquire
where
Miss
Harleth
was
gone
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Lush
felt
a
triumph
that
was
mingled
with
much
distrust
;
for
Grandcourt
had
said
no
word
to
him
about
her
,
and
looked
as
neutral
as
an
alligator
;
there
was
no
telling
what
might
turn
up
in
the
slowly
-
churning
chances
of
his
mind
.
<EOS>
Still
,
to
have
put
off
a
decision
was
to
have
made
room
for
the
waste
of
Grandcourt
's
energy
.
  
<EOS>
The
guests
at
Diplow
felt
more
curiosity
than
their
host
.
<EOS>
How
was
it
that
nothing
more
was
heard
of
Miss
Harleth
?
<EOS>
Was
it
credible
that
she
had
refused
Mr.
Grandcourt
?
<EOS>
Lady
Flora
Hollis
,
a
lively
middle
-
aged
woman
,
well
endowed
with
curiosity
,
felt
a
sudden
interest
in
making
a
round
of
calls
with
Mrs.
Torrington
,
including
the
rectory
,
Offendene
,
and
Quetcham
,
and
thus
not
only
got
twice
over
,
but
also
discussed
with
the
Arrowpoints
,
the
information
that
Miss
Harleth
was
gone
to
Leubronn
,
with
some
old
friends
,
the
Baron
and
Baroness
von
Langen
;
for
the
immediate
agitation
and
disappointment
of
Mrs.
Davilow
and
the
Gascoignes
had
resolved
itself
into
a
wish
that
Gwendolen
's
disappearance
should
not
be
interpreted
as
anything
eccentric
or
needful
to
be
kept
secret
.
<EOS>
The
rector
's
mind
,
indeed
,
entertained
the
possibility
that
the
marriage
was
only
a
little
deferred
,
for
Mrs.
Davilow
had
not
dared
to
tell
him
of
the
bitter
determination
with
which
Gwendolen
had
spoken
.
<EOS>
And
in
spite
of
his
practical
ability
,
some
of
his
experience
had
petrified
into
maxims
and
quotations
.
<EOS>
Amaryllis
fleeing
desired
that
her
hiding
-
place
should
be
known
;
and
that
love
will
find
out
the
way
"
over
the
mountain
and
over
the
wave
"
may
be
said
without
hyperbole
in
this
age
of
steam
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
he
conceived
,
was
an
Amaryllis
of
excellent
sense
but
coquettish
daring
;
the
question
was
whether
she
had
dared
too
much
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Flora
,
coming
back
charged
with
news
about
Miss
Harleth
,
saw
no
good
reason
why
she
should
not
try
whether
she
could
electrify
Mr.
Grandcourt
by
mentioning
it
to
him
at
the
table
;
and
in
doing
so
shot
a
few
hints
of
a
notion
having
got
abroad
that
he
was
a
disappointed
adorer
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
heard
with
quietude
,
but
with
attention
;
and
the
next
day
he
ordered
Lush
to
bring
about
a
decent
reason
for
breaking
up
the
party
at
Diplow
by
the
end
of
another
week
,
as
he
meant
to
go
yachting
to
the
Baltic
or
somewhere
 
it
being
impossible
to
stay
at
Diplow
as
if
he
were
a
prisoner
on
parole
,
with
a
set
of
people
whom
he
had
never
wanted
.
<EOS>
Lush
needed
no
clearer
announcement
that
Grandcourt
was
going
to
Leubronn
;
but
he
might
go
after
the
manner
of
a
creeping
billiard
-
ball
and
stick
on
the
way
.
<EOS>
What
Mr.
Lush
intended
was
to
make
himself
indispensable
so
that
he
might
go
too
,
and
he
succeeded
;
Gwendolen
's
repulsion
for
him
being
a
fact
that
only
amused
his
patron
,
and
made
him
none
the
less
willing
to
have
Lush
always
at
hand
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
how
it
happened
that
Grandcourt
arrived
at
the
_
Czarina
_
on
the
fifth
day
after
Gwendolen
had
left
Leubronn
,
and
found
there
his
uncle
,
Sir
Hugo
Mallinger
,
with
his
family
,
including
Deronda
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
necessarily
a
pleasure
either
to
the
reigning
power
or
the
heir
<EOS>
presumptive
when
their
separate
affairs
 
a
 
touch
of
gout
,
say
,
in
the
one
,
and
a
touch
of
willfulness
in
the
other
 
happen
to
bring
them
to
the
same
spot
.
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
was
an
easy
-
tempered
man
,
tolerant
both
of
differences
and
defects
;
but
a
point
of
view
different
from
his
own
concerning
the
settlement
of
the
family
estates
fretted
him
rather
more
than
if
it
had
concerned
Church
discipline
or
the
ballot
,
and
faults
were
the
less
venial
for
belonging
to
a
person
whose
existence
was
inconvenient
to
him
.
<EOS>
In
no
case
could
Grandcourt
have
been
a
nephew
after
his
own
heart
;
but
as
the
presumptive
heir
to
the
Mallinger
estates
he
was
the
sign
and
embodiment
of
a
chief
grievance
in
the
baronet
's
life
 
the
want
of
a
son
to
inherit
the
lands
,
in
no
portion
of
which
had
he
himself
more
than
a
life
-
interest
.
<EOS>
For
in
the
ill
-
advised
settlement
which
his
father
,
Sir
Francis
,
had
chosen
to
make
by
will
,
even
Diplow
with
its
modicum
of
land
had
been
left
under
the
same
conditions
as
the
ancient
and
wide
inheritance
of
the
two
Toppings
 
Diplow
,
where
Sir
Hugo
had
lived
and
hunted
through
many
a
season
in
his
younger
years
,
and
where
his
wife
and
daughters
ought
to
have
been
able
to
retire
after
his
death
.
  
<EOS>
This
grievance
had
naturally
gathered
emphasis
as
the
years
advanced
,
and
Lady
Mallinger
,
after
having
had
three
daughters
in
quick
succession
,
had
remained
for
eight
years
till
now
that
she
was
over
forty
without
producing
so
much
as
another
girl
;
while
Sir
Hugo
,
almost
twenty
years
older
,
was
at
a
time
of
life
when
,
notwithstanding
the
fashionable
retardation
of
most
things
from
dinners
to
marriages
,
a
man
's
hopefulness
is
apt
to
show
signs
of
wear
,
until
restored
by
second
childhood
.
  
<EOS>
In
fact
,
he
had
begun
to
despair
of
a
son
,
and
this
confirmation
of
Grandcourt
's
interest
in
the
estates
certainly
tended
to
make
his
image
and
presence
the
more
unwelcome
;
but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
it
carried
circumstances
which
disposed
Sir
Hugo
to
take
care
that
the
relation
between
them
should
be
kept
as
friendly
as
possible
.
<EOS>
It
led
him
to
dwell
on
a
plan
which
had
grown
up
side
by
side
with
his
disappointment
of
an
heir
;
namely
,
to
try
and
secure
Diplow
as
a
future
residence
for
Lady
Mallinger
and
her
daughters
,
and
keep
this
pretty
bit
of
the
family
inheritance
for
his
own
offspring
in
spite
of
that
disappointment
.
<EOS>
Such
knowledge
as
he
had
of
his
nephew
's
disposition
and
affairs
encouraged
the
belief
that
Grandcourt
might
consent
to
a
transaction
by
which
he
would
get
a
good
sum
of
ready
money
,
as
an
equivalent
for
his
prospective
interest
in
the
domain
of
Diplow
and
the
moderate
amount
of
land
attached
to
it
.
<EOS>
If
,
after
all
,
the
unhoped
-
for
son
should
be
born
,
the
money
would
have
been
thrown
away
,
and
Grandcourt
would
have
been
paid
for
giving
up
interests
that
had
turned
out
good
for
nothing
;
but
Sir
Hugo
set
down
this
risk
as
_
nil
_
,
and
of
late
years
he
had
husbanded
his
fortune
so
well
by
the
working
of
mines
and
the
sale
of
leases
that
he
was
prepared
for
an
outlay
.
  
<EOS>
Here
was
an
object
that
made
him
careful
to
avoid
any
quarrel
with
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
Some
years
before
,
when
he
was
making
improvements
at
the
Abbey
,
and
needed
Grandcourt
's
concurrence
in
his
felling
an
obstructive
mass
of
timber
on
the
demesne
,
he
had
congratulated
himself
on
finding
that
there
was
no
active
spite
against
him
in
his
nephew
's
peculiar
mind
;
and
nothing
had
since
occurred
to
make
them
hate
each
other
more
than
was
compatible
with
perfect
politeness
,
or
with
any
accommodation
that
could
be
strictly
mutual
.
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
,
on
his
side
,
thought
his
uncle
a
superfluity
and
a
bore
,
and
felt
that
the
list
of
things
in
general
would
be
improved
whenever
Sir
Hugo
came
to
be
expunged
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
been
made
aware
through
Lush
,
always
a
useful
medium
,
of
the
baronet
's
inclinations
concerning
Diplow
,
and
he
was
gratified
to
have
the
alternative
of
the
money
in
his
mind
:
even
if
he
had
not
thought
it
in
the
least
likely
that
he
would
choose
to
accept
it
,
his
sense
of
power
would
have
been
flattered
by
his
being
able
to
refuse
what
Sir
Hugo
desired
.
<EOS>
The
hinted
transaction
had
told
for
something
among
the
motives
which
had
made
him
ask
for
a
year
's
tenancy
of
Diplow
,
which
it
had
rather
annoyed
Sir
Hugo
to
grant
,
because
the
excellent
hunting
in
the
neighborhood
might
decide
Grandcourt
not
to
part
with
his
chance
of
future
possession
;
 
a
man
who
has
two
places
,
in
one
of
which
the
hunting
is
less
good
,
naturally
desiring
a
third
where
it
is
better
.
<EOS>
Also
,
Lush
had
thrown
out
to
Sir
Hugo
the
probability
that
Grandcourt
would
woo
and
win
Miss
Arrowpoint
,
and
in
that
case
ready
money
might
be
less
of
a
temptation
to
him
.
<EOS>
Hence
,
on
this
unexpected
meeting
at
Leubronn
,
the
baronet
felt
much
curiosity
to
know
how
things
had
been
going
on
at
Diplow
,
was
bent
on
being
as
civil
as
possible
to
his
nephew
,
and
looked
forward
to
some
private
chat
with
Lush
.
  
<EOS>
Between
Deronda
and
Grandcourt
there
was
a
more
faintly
-
marked
but
peculiar
relation
,
depending
on
circumstances
which
have
yet
to
be
made
known
.
<EOS>
But
on
no
side
was
there
any
sign
of
suppressed
chagrin
on
the
first
meeting
at
the
_
table
d'hôte
_
,
an
hour
after
Grandcourt
's
arrival
;
and
when
the
quartette
of
gentlemen
afterward
met
on
the
terrace
,
without
Lady
Mallinger
,
they
moved
off
together
to
saunter
through
the
rooms
,
Sir
Hugo
saying
as
they
entered
the
large
_
saal
_
    
<EOS>
"
Did
you
play
much
at
Baden
,
Grandcourt
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
looked
on
and
betted
a
little
with
some
Russians
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Had
you
luck
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
I
win
,
Lush
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
brought
away
about
two
hundred
,
"
said
Lush
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
here
for
the
sake
of
the
play
,
then
?
"
said
Sir
Hugo
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
do
n't
care
about
play
now
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
confounded
strain
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
whose
diamond
ring
and
demeanor
,
as
he
moved
along
playing
slightly
with
his
whisker
,
were
being
a
good
deal
stared
at
by
rouged
foreigners
interested
in
a
new
milord
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
fact
is
,
somebody
should
invent
a
mill
to
do
amusements
for
you
,
my
dear
fellow
,
"
said
Sir
Hugo
,
"
as
the
Tartars
get
their
praying
done
.
<EOS>
But
I
agree
with
you
;
I
never
cared
for
play
.
<EOS>
It
's
monotonous
 
knits
the
brain
up
into
meshes
.
<EOS>
And
it
knocks
me
up
to
watch
it
now
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
one
gets
poisoned
with
the
bad
air
.
<EOS>
I
never
stay
here
more
than
ten
minutes
.
<EOS>
But
where
's
your
gambling
beauty
,
Deronda
?
<EOS>
Have
you
seen
her
lately
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
gone
,
"
said
Deronda
,
curtly
.
  
<EOS>
"
An
uncommonly
fine
girl
,
a
perfect
Diana
,
"
said
Sir
Hugo
,
turning
to
Grandcourt
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Really
worth
a
little
straining
to
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
I
saw
her
winning
,
and
she
took
it
as
coolly
as
if
she
had
known
it
all
beforehand
.
<EOS>
The
same
day
Deronda
happened
to
see
her
losing
like
wildfire
,
and
she
bore
it
with
immense
pluck
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
she
was
cleaned
out
,
or
was
wise
enough
to
stop
in
time
.
<EOS>
How
do
you
know
she
's
gone
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
by
the
Visitor
-
list
,
"
said
Deronda
,
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
shrug
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Vandernoodt
told
me
her
name
was
Harleth
,
and
she
was
with
the
Baron
and
Baroness
von
Langen
.
<EOS>
I
saw
by
the
list
that
Miss
Harleth
was
no
longer
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
held
no
further
information
for
Lush
than
that
Gwendolen
had
been
gambling
.
<EOS>
He
had
already
looked
at
the
list
,
and
ascertained
that
Gwendolen
had
gone
,
but
he
had
no
intention
of
thrusting
this
knowledge
on
Grandcourt
before
he
asked
for
it
;
and
he
had
not
asked
,
finding
it
enough
to
believe
that
the
object
of
search
would
turn
up
somewhere
or
other
.
  
<EOS>
But
now
Grandcourt
had
heard
what
was
rather
piquant
,
and
<EOS>
not
a
word
about
Miss
Harleth
had
been
missed
by
him
.
<EOS>
After
a
moment
's
pause
he
said
to
Deronda
    
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
those
people
 
the
Langens
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
talked
with
them
a
little
since
Miss
Harleth
went
away
.
<EOS>
I
knew
nothing
of
them
before
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
she
gone
 
<EOS>
do
you
know
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
gone
home
,
"
said
Deronda
,
coldly
,
as
if
he
wished
to
say
no
more
.
<EOS>
But
then
,
from
a
fresh
impulse
,
he
turned
to
look
markedly
at
Grandcourt
,
and
added
,
"
<EOS>
But
it
is
possible
you
know
her
.
<EOS>
Her
home
is
not
far
from
Diplow
:
Offendene
,
near
Winchester
.
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
,
turning
to
look
straight
at
Grandcourt
,
who
was
on
his
left
hand
,
might
have
been
a
subject
for
those
old
painters
who
liked
contrasts
of
temperament
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
calm
intensity
of
life
and
richness
of
tint
in
his
face
that
on
a
sudden
gaze
from
him
was
rather
startling
,
and
often
made
him
seem
to
have
spoken
,
so
that
servants
and
officials
asked
him
automatically
,
"
What
did
you
say
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
when
he
had
been
quite
silent
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
himself
felt
an
irritation
,
which
he
did
not
show
except
by
a
slight
movement
of
the
eyelids
,
at
Deronda
's
turning
round
on
him
when
he
was
not
asked
to
do
more
than
speak
.
<EOS>
But
he
answered
,
with
his
usual
drawl
,
"
Yes
,
I
know
her
,
"
and
paused
with
his
shoulder
toward
Deronda
,
to
look
at
the
gambling
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
of
her
,
eh
?
"
asked
Sir
Hugo
of
Lush
,
as
the
three
moved
on
a
little
way
.
<EOS>
"
She
must
be
a
new
-
comer
at
Offendene
.
<EOS>
Old
Blenny
lived
there
after
the
dowager
died
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
A
little
too
much
of
her
,
"
said
Lush
,
in
a
low
,
significant
tone
;
not
sorry
to
let
Sir
Hugo
know
the
state
of
affairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
how
?
"
said
the
baronet
.
<EOS>
They
all
moved
out
of
the
_
salon
_
into
an
airy
promenade
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
been
on
the
brink
of
marrying
her
,
"
Lush
went
on
.
"
<EOS>
But
I
hope
it
's
off
now
.
<EOS>
She
's
a
niece
of
the
clergyman
 
<EOS>
Gascoigne
 
at
Pennicote
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
is
a
widow
with
a
brood
of
daughters
.
<EOS>
This
girl
will
have
nothing
,
and
is
as
dangerous
as
gunpowder
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
foolish
marriage
.
<EOS>
But
she
has
taken
a
freak
against
him
,
for
she
ran
off
here
without
notice
,
when
he
had
agreed
to
call
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
The
fact
is
,
he
's
here
after
her
;
but
he
was
in
no
great
hurry
,
and
between
his
caprice
and
hers
they
are
likely
enough
not
to
get
together
again
.
<EOS>
But
of
course
he
has
lost
his
chance
with
the
heiress
.
"
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
joining
them
said
,
"
What
a
beastly
den
this
is
!
 
<EOS>
a
worse
hole
than
Baden
.
<EOS>
I
shall
go
back
to
the
hotel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
Sir
Hugo
and
Deronda
were
alone
,
the
baronet
began
    
"
<EOS>
Rather
a
pretty
story
.
<EOS>
That
girl
has
something
in
her
.
<EOS>
She
must
be
worth
running
after
 
has
_
de
l'imprévu
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
I
think
her
appearance
on
the
scene
has
bettered
my
chance
of
getting
Diplow
,
whether
the
marriage
comes
off
or
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
hope
a
marriage
like
that
would
not
come
off
,
"
said
Deronda
,
in
a
tone
of
disgust
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
are
you
a
little
touched
with
the
sublime
lash
?
"
said
Sir
Hugo
,
putting
up
his
glasses
to
help
his
short
sight
in
looking
at
his
companion
.
<EOS>
"
Are
you
inclined
to
run
after
her
?
"
  
"
On
the
contrary
,
"
said
Deronda
,
"
I
should
rather
be
inclined
to
run
away
from
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
would
easily
cut
out
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
A
girl
with
her
spirit
would
think
you
the
finer
match
of
the
two
,
"
said
Sir
Hugo
,
who
often
tried
Deronda
's
patience
by
finding
a
joke
in
impossible
advice
.
<EOS>
(
A
difference
of
taste
in
jokes
is
a
great
strain
on
the
affections
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
pedigree
and
land
belong
to
a
fine
match
,
"
said
Deronda
,
coldly
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
best
horse
will
win
in
spite
of
pedigree
,
my
boy
.
<EOS>
You
remember
Napoleon
's
_
mot
 
<EOS>
Je
suis
un
ancêtre
<EOS>
_
"
said
Sir
Hugo
,
who
habitually
undervalued
birth
,
as
men
after
dining
well
often
agree
that
the
good
of
life
is
distributed
with
wonderful
equality
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
sure
that
I
want
to
be
an
ancestor
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
It
does
n't
seem
to
me
the
rarest
sort
of
origination
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
run
after
the
pretty
gambler
,
then
?
"
said
Sir
Hugo
,
putting
down
his
glasses
.
  
<EOS>
"
Decidedly
not

This
answer
was
perfectly
truthful
;
nevertheless
it
had
passed
through
Deronda
's
mind
that
under
other
circumstances
he
should
have
given
way
to
the
interest
this
girl
had
raised
in
him
,
and
tried
to
know
more
of
her
.
<EOS>
But
his
history
had
given
him
a
stronger
bias
in
another
direction
.
<EOS>
He
felt
himself
in
no
sense
free
.
        
<EOS>
Men
,
like
planets
,
have
both
a
visible
and
an
invisible
history
.
<EOS>
The
    
astronomer
threads
the
darkness
with
strict
deduction
,
accounting
so
    
for
every
visible
arc
in
the
wanderer
's
orbit
;
and
the
narrator
of
    
human
actions
,
if
he
did
his
work
with
the
same
completeness
,
would
    
have
to
thread
the
hidden
pathways
of
feeling
and
thought
which
lead
    
up
to
every
moment
of
action
,
and
to
those
moments
of
intense
    
suffering
which
take
the
quality
of
action
 
like
the
cry
of
    
Prometheus
,
whose
chained
anguish
seems
a
greater
energy
than
the
sea
    
and
sky
he
invokes
and
the
deity
he
defies
.
   
<EOS>
Deronda
's
circumstances
,
indeed
,
had
been
exceptional
.
<EOS>
One
moment
had
been
burned
into
his
life
as
its
chief
epoch
 
a
moment
full
of
July
sunshine
and
large
pink
roses
shedding
their
last
petals
on
a
grassy
court
enclosed
on
three
sides
by
a
gothic
cloister
.
<EOS>
Imagine
him
in
such
a
scene
:
a
boy
of
thirteen
,
stretched
prone
on
the
grass
where
it
was
in
shadow
,
his
curly
head
propped
on
his
arms
over
a
book
,
while
his
tutor
,
also
reading
,
sat
on
a
camp
-
stool
under
shelter
.
<EOS>
Deronda
's
book
was
Sismondi
's
"
History
of
the
Italian
Republics
"
;
 
the
lad
had
a
passion
for
history
,
eager
to
know
how
time
had
been
filled
up
since
the
flood
,
and
how
things
were
carried
on
in
the
dull
periods
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
he
let
down
his
left
arm
and
looked
at
his
tutor
,
saying
in
purest
boyish
tones
    
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Fraser
,
how
was
it
that
the
popes
and
cardinals
always
had
so
many
nephews
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
tutor
,
an
able
young
Scotchman
,
who
acted
as
Sir
Hugo
Mallinger
's
secretary
,
roused
rather
unwillingly
from
his
political
economy
,
answered
with
the
clear
-
cut
emphatic
chant
which
makes
a
truth
doubly
telling
in
Scotch
utterance
    
<EOS>
"
Their
own
children
were
called
nephews
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
said
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
just
for
the
propriety
of
the
thing
;
because
,
as
you
know
very
well
,
priests
do
n't
marry
,
and
the
children
were
illegitimate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Fraser
,
thrusting
out
his
lower
lip
and
making
his
chant
of
the
last
word
the
more
emphatic
for
a
little
impatience
at
being
interrupted
,
had
already
turned
his
eyes
on
his
book
again
,
while
Deronda
,
as
if
something
had
stung
him
,
started
up
in
a
sitting
attitude
with
his
back
to
the
tutor
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
always
called
Sir
Hugo
Mallinger
his
uncle
,
and
when
it
once
occurred
to
him
to
ask
about
his
father
and
mother
,
the
baronet
had
answered
,
"
You
lost
your
father
and
mother
when
you
were
quite
a
little
one
;
that
is
why
I
take
care
of
you
.
"
<EOS>
Daniel
then
straining
to
discern
something
in
that
early
twilight
,
had
a
dim
sense
of
having
been
kissed
very
much
,
and
surrounded
by
thin
,
cloudy
,
scented
drapery
,
till
his
fingers
caught
in
something
hard
,
which
hurt
him
,
and
he
began
to
cry
.
<EOS>
Every
other
memory
he
had
was
of
the
little
world
in
which
he
still
lived
.
<EOS>
And
at
that
time
he
did
not
mind
about
learning
more
,
for
he
was
too
fond
of
Sir
Hugo
to
be
sorry
for
the
loss
of
unknown
parents
.
<EOS>
Life
was
very
delightful
to
the
lad
,
with
an
uncle
who
was
always
indulgent
and
cheerful
 
a
fine
man
in
the
bright
noon
of
life
,
whom
Daniel
thought
absolutely
perfect
,
and
whose
place
was
one
of
the
finest
in
England
,
at
once
historical
;
romantic
,
and
home
-
like
:
a
picturesque
architectural
outgrowth
from
an
abbey
,
which
had
still
remnants
of
the
old
monastic
trunk
.
<EOS>
Diplow
lay
in
another
county
,
and
was
a
comparatively
landless
place
which
had
come
into
the
family
from
a
rich
lawyer
on
the
female
side
who
wore
the
perruque
of
the
restoration
;
whereas
the
Mallingers
had
the
grant
of
Monk
's
Topping
under
Henry
the
Eighth
,
and
ages
before
had
held
the
neighboring
lands
of
King
's
Topping
,
tracing
indeed
their
origin
to
a
certain
Hugues
le
Malingre
,
who
came
in
with
the
Conqueror
 
and
also
apparently
with
a
sickly
complexion
which
had
been
happily
corrected
in
his
descendants
.
<EOS>
Two
rows
of
these
descendants
,
direct
and
collateral
,
females
of
the
male
line
,
and
males
of
the
female
,
looked
down
in
the
gallery
over
the
cloisters
on
the
nephew
Daniel
as
he
walked
there
:
men
in
armor
with
pointed
beards
and
arched
eyebrows
,
pinched
ladies
in
hoops
and
ruffs
with
no
face
to
speak
of
;
grave
-
looking
men
in
black
velvet
and
stuffed
hips
,
and
fair
,
frightened
women
holding
little
boys
by
the
hand
;
smiling
politicians
in
magnificent
perruques
,
and
ladies
of
the
prize
-
animal
kind
,
with
rosebud
mouths
and
full
eyelids
,
according
to
Lely
;
then
a
generation
whose
faces
were
revised
and
embellished
in
the
taste
of
Kneller
;
and
so
on
through
refined
editions
of
the
family
types
in
the
time
of
Reynolds
and
Romney
,
till
the
line
ended
with
Sir
Hugo
and
his
younger
brother
Henleigh
.
<EOS>
This
last
had
married
Miss
Grandcourt
,
and
taken
her
name
along
with
her
estates
,
thus
making
a
junction
between
two
equally
old
families
,
impaling
the
three
Saracens
'
heads
proper
and
three
bezants
of
the
one
with
the
tower
and
falcons
_
argent
_
of
the
other
,
and
,
as
it
happened
,
uniting
their
highest
advantages
in
the
prospects
of
that
Henleigh
Mallinger
Grandcourt
who
is
at
present
more
of
an
acquaintance
to
us
than
either
Sir
Hugo
or
his
nephew
Daniel
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
In
Sir
Hugo
's
youthful
portrait
with
rolled
collar
and
high
cravat
,
Sir
Thomas
Lawrence
had
done
justice
to
the
agreeable
alacrity
of
expression
and
sanguine
temperament
still
to
be
seen
in
the
original
,
but
had
done
something
more
than
justice
in
slightly
lengthening
the
nose
,
which
was
in
reality
shorter
than
might
have
been
expected
in
a
Mallinger
.
<EOS>
Happily
the
appropriate
nose
of
the
family
reappeared
in
his
younger
brother
,
and
was
to
be
seen
in
all
its
refined
regularity
in
his
nephew
Mallinger
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
But
in
the
nephew
Daniel
Deronda
the
family
faces
of
various
types
,
seen
on
the
walls
of
the
gallery
;
found
no
reflex
.
<EOS>
Still
he
was
handsomer
than
any
of
them
,
and
when
he
was
thirteen
might
have
served
as
model
for
any
painter
who
wanted
to
image
the
most
memorable
of
boys
<EOS>
:
you
could
hardly
have
seen
his
face
thoroughly
meeting
yours
without
believing
that
human
creatures
had
done
nobly
in
times
past
,
and
might
do
more
nobly
in
time
to
come
.
<EOS>
The
finest
childlike
faces
have
this
consecrating
power
,
and
make
us
shudder
anew
at
all
the
grossness
and
basely
-
wrought
griefs
of
the
world
,
lest
they
should
enter
here
and
defile
.
  
<EOS>
But
at
this
moment
on
the
grass
among
the
rose
-
petals
,
Daniel
Deronda
was
making
a
first
acquaintance
with
those
griefs
.
<EOS>
A
new
idea
had
entered
his
mind
,
and
was
beginning
to
change
the
aspect
of
his
habitual
feelings
as
happy
<EOS>
careless
voyagers
are
changed
with
the
sky
suddenly
threatened
and
the
thought
of
danger
arises
.
<EOS>
He
sat
perfectly
still
with
his
back
to
the
tutor
,
while
his
face
expressed
rapid
inward
transition
.
<EOS>
The
deep
blush
,
which
had
come
when
he
first
started
up
,
gradually
subsided
;
but
his
features
kept
that
indescribable
look
of
subdued
activity
which
often
accompanies
a
new
mental
survey
of
familiar
facts
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
lived
with
other
boys
,
and
his
mind
showed
the
same
blending
of
child
's
ignorance
with
surprising
knowledge
which
is
oftener
seen
in
bright
girls
.
<EOS>
Having
read
Shakespeare
as
well
as
a
great
deal
of
history
,
he
could
have
talked
with
the
wisdom
of
a
bookish
child
about
men
who
were
born
out
of
wedlock
and
were
held
unfortunate
in
consequence
,
being
under
disadvantages
which
required
them
to
be
a
sort
of
heroes
if
they
were
to
work
themselves
up
to
an
equal
standing
with
their
legally
born
brothers
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
never
brought
such
knowledge
into
any
association
with
his
own
lot
,
which
had
been
too
easy
for
him
ever
to
think
about
it
 
until
this
moment
when
there
had
darted
into
his
mind
with
the
magic
of
quick
comparison
,
the
possibility
that
here
was
the
secret
of
his
own
birth
,
and
that
the
man
whom
he
called
uncle
was
really
his
father
.
<EOS>
Some
children
,
even
younger
than
Daniel
,
have
known
the
first
arrival
of
care
,
like
an
ominous
irremovable
guest
in
their
tender
lives
,
on
the
discovery
that
their
parents
,
whom
they
had
imagined
able
to
buy
everything
,
were
poor
and
in
hard
money
troubles
.
<EOS>
Daniel
felt
the
presence
of
a
new
guest
who
seemed
to
come
with
an
enigmatic
veiled
face
,
and
to
carry
dimly
-
conjectured
,
dreaded
revelations
.
<EOS>
The
ardor
which
he
had
given
to
the
imaginary
world
in
his
books
suddenly
rushed
toward
his
own
history
and
spent
its
pictorial
energy
there
,
explaining
what
he
knew
,
representing
the
unknown
.
<EOS>
The
uncle
whom
he
loved
very
dearly
took
the
aspect
of
a
father
who
held
secrets
about
him
 
who
had
done
him
a
wrong
 
<EOS>
yes
,
a
wrong
:
<EOS>
and
what
had
become
of
his
mother
,
for
whom
he
must
have
been
taken
away
?
 
<EOS>
Secrets
about
which
he
,
Daniel
,
could
never
inquire
;
for
to
speak
or
to
be
spoken
to
about
these
new
thoughts
seemed
like
falling
flakes
of
fire
to
his
imagination
.
<EOS>
Those
who
have
known
an
impassioned
childhood
will
understand
this
dread
of
utterance
about
any
shame
connected
with
their
parents
.
<EOS>
The
impetuous
advent
of
new
images
took
possession
of
him
with
the
force
of
fact
for
the
first
time
told
,
and
left
him
no
immediate
power
for
the
reflection
that
he
might
be
trembling
at
a
fiction
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
The
terrible
sense
of
collision
between
a
strong
rush
of
feeling
and
the
dread
of
its
betrayal
,
found
relief
at
length
in
big
slow
tears
,
which
fell
without
restraint
until
the
voice
of
Mr.
Fraser
was
heard
saying
:
  
"
Daniel
,
do
you
see
that
you
are
sitting
on
the
bent
pages
of
your
book
?
"
  
<EOS>
Daniel
immediately
moved
the
book
without
turning
round
,
and
after
holding
it
before
him
for
an
instant
,
rose
with
it
and
walked
away
into
the
open
grounds
,
where
he
could
dry
his
tears
unobserved
.
<EOS>
The
first
shock
of
suggestion
past
,
he
could
remember
that
he
had
no
certainty
how
things
really
had
been
,
and
that
he
had
been
making
conjectures
about
his
own
history
,
as
he
had
often
made
stories
about
Pericles
or
Columbus
,
just
to
fill
up
the
blanks
before
they
became
famous
.
<EOS>
Only
there
came
back
certain
facts
which
had
an
obstinate
reality
,
 
almost
like
the
fragments
of
a
bridge
,
telling
you
unmistakably
how
the
arches
lay
.
<EOS>
And
again
there
came
a
mood
in
which
his
conjectures
seemed
like
a
doubt
of
religion
,
to
be
banished
as
an
offense
,
and
a
mean
prying
after
what
he
was
not
meant
to
know
;
for
there
was
hardly
a
delicacy
of
feeling
this
lad
was
not
capable
of
.
<EOS>
But
the
summing
-
up
of
all
his
fluctuating
experience
at
this
epoch
was
,
that
a
secret
impression
had
come
to
him
which
had
given
him
something
like
a
new
sense
in
relation
to
all
the
elements
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
And
the
idea
that
others
probably
knew
things
concerning
which
they
did
not
choose
to
mention
,
set
up
in
him
a
premature
reserve
which
helped
to
intensify
his
inward
experience
.
<EOS>
His
ears
open
now
to
words
which
before
that
July
day
would
have
passed
by
him
unnoted
;
and
round
every
trivial
incident
which
imagination
could
connect
with
his
suspicions
,
a
newly
-
roused
set
of
feelings
were
ready
to
cluster
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
One
such
incident
a
month
later
wrought
itself
deeply
into
his
life
.
<EOS>
Daniel
had
not
only
one
of
those
thrilling
boy
voices
which
seem
to
bring
an
idyllic
heaven
and
earth
before
our
eyes
,
but
a
fine
musical
instinct
,
and
had
early
made
out
accompaniments
for
himself
on
the
piano
,
while
he
sang
from
memory
.
<EOS>
Since
then
he
had
had
some
teaching
,
and
Sir
Hugo
,
who
delighted
in
the
boy
,
used
to
ask
for
his
music
in
the
presence
of
guests
.
<EOS>
One
morning
after
he
had
been
singing
"
Sweet
Echo
"
before
a
small
party
of
gentlemen
whom
the
rain
had
kept
in
the
house
,
the
baronet
,
passing
from
a
smiling
remark
to
his
next
neighbor
said
:
  
"
<EOS>
Come
here
,
Dan
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
boy
came
forward
with
unusual
reluctance
.
<EOS>
He
wore
an
embroidered
holland
blouse
which
set
off
the
rich
coloring
of
his
head
and
throat
,
and
the
resistant
gravity
about
his
mouth
and
eyes
as
he
was
being
smiled
upon
,
made
their
beauty
the
more
impressive
.
<EOS>
Every
one
was
admiring
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
say
to
being
a
great
singer
?
<EOS>
Should
you
like
to
be
adored
by
the
world
and
take
the
house
by
storm
;
like
Mario
and
Tamberlik
?
"
  
<EOS>
Daniel
reddened
instantaneously
,
but
there
was
a
just
perceptible
interval
before
he
answered
with
angry
decision
    
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
should
hate
it
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
well
!
"
said
Sir
Hugo
,
with
surprised
kindliness
intended
to
be
soothing
.
<EOS>
But
Daniel
turned
away
quickly
,
left
the
room
,
and
going
to
his
own
chamber
threw
himself
on
the
broad
window
-
sill
,
which
was
a
favorite
retreat
of
his
when
he
had
nothing
particular
to
do
.
<EOS>
Here
he
could
see
the
rain
gradually
subsiding
with
gleams
through
the
parting
clouds
which
lit
up
a
great
reach
of
the
park
,
where
the
old
oaks
stood
apart
from
each
other
,
and
the
bordering
wood
was
pierced
with
a
green
glade
which
met
the
eastern
sky
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
scene
which
had
always
been
part
of
his
home
 
part
of
the
dignified
ease
which
had
been
a
matter
of
course
in
his
life
.
<EOS>
And
his
ardent
clinging
nature
had
appropriated
it
all
with
affection
.
<EOS>
He
knew
a
great
deal
of
what
it
was
to
be
a
gentleman
by
inheritance
,
and
without
thinking
much
about
himself
 
<EOS>
for
he
was
a
boy
of
active
perceptions
and
easily
forgot
his
own
existence
in
that
of
Robert
Bruce
 
<EOS>
he
had
never
supposed
that
he
could
be
shut
out
from
such
a
lot
,
or
have
a
very
different
part
in
the
world
from
that
of
the
uncle
who
petted
him
.
<EOS>
It
is
possible
(
though
not
greatly
believed
in
at
present
)
to
be
fond
of
poverty
and
take
it
for
a
bride
,
to
prefer
scoured
deal
,
red
quarries
and
whitewash
for
one
's
private
surroundings
,
to
delight
in
no
splendor
but
what
has
open
doors
for
the
whole
nation
,
and
to
glory
in
having
no
privileges
except
such
as
nature
insists
on
;
and
noblemen
have
been
known
to
run
away
from
elaborate
ease
and
the
option
of
idleness
,
that
they
might
bind
themselves
for
small
pay
to
hard
-
handed
labor
.
<EOS>
But
Daniel
's
tastes
were
altogether
in
keeping
with
his
nurture
:
his
disposition
was
one
in
which
everyday
scenes
and
habits
beget
not
<EOS>
_
ennui
_
or
rebellion
,
but
delight
,
affection
,
aptitudes
;
and
now
the
lad
had
been
stung
to
the
quick
by
the
idea
that
his
uncle
 
perhaps
his
father
 
thought
of
a
career
for
him
which
was
totally
unlike
his
own
,
and
which
he
knew
very
well
was
not
thought
of
among
possible
destinations
for
the
sons
of
English
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
He
had
often
stayed
in
London
with
Sir
Hugo
,
who
to
indulge
the
boy
's
ear
had
carried
him
to
the
opera
to
hear
the
great
tenors
,
so
that
the
image
of
a
singer
taking
the
house
by
storm
was
very
vivid
to
him
;
but
now
,
spite
of
his
musical
gift
,
he
set
himself
bitterly
against
the
notion
of
being
dressed
up
to
sing
before
all
those
fine
people
,
who
would
not
care
about
him
except
as
a
wonderful
toy
.
<EOS>
That
Sir
Hugo
should
have
thought
of
him
in
that
position
for
a
moment
,
seemed
to
Daniel
an
unmistakable
proof
that
there
was
something
about
his
birth
which
threw
him
out
from
the
class
of
gentlemen
to
which
the
baronet
belonged
.
<EOS>
Would
it
ever
be
mentioned
to
him
?
<EOS>
Would
the
time
come
when
his
uncle
would
tell
him
everything
?
<EOS>
He
shrank
from
the
prospect
:
in
his
imagination
he
preferred
ignorance
.
<EOS>
If
his
father
had
been
wicked
 
Daniel
inwardly
used
strong
words
,
for
he
was
feeling
the
injury
<EOS>
done
him
as
a
maimed
boy
feels
the
crushed
limb
which
for
others
is
merely
reckoned
in
an
average
of
accidents
 
if
his
father
had
done
any
wrong
<EOS>
,
he
wished
it
might
never
be
spoken
of
to
him
:
it
was
already
a
cutting
thought
that
such
knowledge
might
be
in
other
minds
.
<EOS>
Was
it
in
Mr.
Fraser
's
?
<EOS>
probably
not
,
else
he
would
not
have
spoken
in
that
way
about
the
pope
's
nephews
.
<EOS>
Daniel
fancied
,
as
older
people
do
,
that
every
one
else
's
consciousness
was
as
active
as
his
own
on
a
matter
which
was
vital
to
him
.
<EOS>
Did
Turvey
the
valet
know
?
 
and
old
Mrs.
French
the
housekeeper
?
 
<EOS>
and
Banks
the
bailiff
,
with
whom
he
had
ridden
about
the
farms
on
his
pony
?
 
<EOS>
And
now
there
came
back
the
recollection
of
a
day
some
years
before
when
he
was
drinking
Mrs.
Banks
's
whey
,
and
Banks
said
to
his
wife
with
a
wink
and
a
cunning
laugh
,
"
He
features
the
mother
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
At
that
time
little
Daniel
had
merely
thought
that
Banks
made
a
silly
face
,
as
the
common
farming
men
often
did
,
laughing
at
what
was
not
laughable
;
and
he
rather
resented
being
winked
at
and
talked
of
as
if
he
did
not
understand
everything
.
<EOS>
But
now
that
small
incident
became
information
:
it
was
to
be
reasoned
on
.
<EOS>
How
could
he
be
like
his
mother
and
not
like
his
father
?
<EOS>
His
mother
must
have
been
a
Mallinger
,
if
Sir
Hugo
were
his
uncle
.
<EOS>
But
no
!
<EOS>
His
father
might
have
been
Sir
Hugo
's
brother
and
have
changed
his
name
,
as
Mr.
Henleigh
Mallinger
did
when
he
married
Miss
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
But
then
,
why
had
he
never
heard
Sir
Hugo
speak
of
his
brother
Deronda
,
as
he
spoke
of
his
brother
Grandcourt
?
<EOS>
Daniel
had
never
before
cared
about
the
family
tree
 
only
about
that
ancestor
who
had
killed
three
Saracens
in
one
encounter
.
<EOS>
But
now
his
mind
turned
to
a
cabinet
of
estate
-
maps
in
the
library
,
where
he
had
once
seen
an
illuminated
parchment
hanging
out
,
that
Sir
Hugo
said
was
the
family
tree
.
<EOS>
The
phrase
was
new
and
odd
to
him
 
<EOS>
he
was
a
little
fellow
then
 
hardly
more
than
half
his
present
age
 
<EOS>
and
he
gave
it
no
precise
meaning
.
<EOS>
He
knew
more
now
and
wished
that
he
could
examine
that
parchment
.
<EOS>
He
imagined
that
the
cabinet
was
always
locked
,
and
longed
to
try
it
.
<EOS>
But
here
he
checked
himself
.
<EOS>
He
might
be
seen
:
and
he
would
never
bring
himself
near
even
a
silent
admission
of
the
sore
that
had
opened
in
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
in
such
experiences
of
a
boy
or
girlhood
,
while
elders
are
debating
whether
most
education
lies
in
science
or
literature
,
that
the
main
lines
of
character
are
often
laid
down
.
<EOS>
If
Daniel
had
been
of
a
less
ardently
affectionate
nature
,
the
reserve
about
himself
and
the
supposition
that
others
had
something
to
his
disadvantage
in
their
minds
,
might
have
turned
into
a
hard
,
proud
antagonism
.
<EOS>
But
inborn
lovingness
was
strong
enough
to
keep
itself
level
with
resentment
.
<EOS>
There
was
hardly
any
creature
in
his
habitual
world
that
he
was
not
fond
of
;
teasing
them
occasionally
,
of
course
 
all
except
his
uncle
,
or
"
Nunc
,
"
as
Sir
Hugo
had
taught
him
to
say
;
for
the
baronet
was
the
reverse
of
a
strait
-
laced
man
,
and
left
his
dignity
to
take
care
of
itself
.
<EOS>
Him
Daniel
loved
in
that
deep
-
rooted
filial
way
which
makes
children
always
the
happier
for
being
in
the
same
room
with
father
or
mother
,
though
their
occupations
may
be
quite
apart
.
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
's
watch
-
chain
and
seals
,
his
handwriting
,
his
mode
of
smoking
and
of
talking
to
his
dogs
and
horses
,
had
all
a
rightness
and
charm
about
them
to
the
boy
which
went
along
with
the
happiness
of
morning
and
breakfast
time
.
<EOS>
That
Sir
Hugo
had
always
been
a
Whig
,
made
Tories
and
Radicals
equally
opponents
of
the
truest
and
best
;
and
the
books
he
had
written
were
all
seen
under
the
same
consecration
of
loving
belief
which
differenced
what
was
his
from
what
was
not
his
,
in
spite
of
general
resemblance
.
<EOS>
Those
writings
were
various
,
from
volumes
of
travel
in
the
brilliant
style
,
to
articles
on
things
in
general
,
and
pamphlets
on
political
crises
;
but
to
Daniel
they
were
alike
in
having
an
unquestionable
rightness
by
which
other
people
's
information
could
be
tested
.
  
<EOS>
Who
can
not
imagine
the
bitterness
of
a
first
suspicion
that
something
in
this
object
of
complete
love
was
_
not
_
quite
right
?
<EOS>
Children
demand
that
their
heroes
should
be
fleckless
,
and
easily
believe
them
so
:
perhaps
a
first
discovery
to
the
contrary
is
hardly
a
less
revolutionary
shock
to
a
passionate
child
than
the
threatened
downfall
of
habitual
beliefs
which
makes
the
world
seem
to
totter
for
us
in
maturer
life
.
  
<EOS>
But
some
time
after
this
renewal
of
Daniel
's
agitation
it
appeared
that
Sir
Hugo
must
have
been
making
a
merely
playful
experiment
in
his
question
about
the
singing
.
<EOS>
He
sent
for
Daniel
into
the
library
,
and
looking
up
from
his
writing
as
the
boy
entered
threw
himself
sideways
in
his
armchair
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
Dan
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
kindly
,
drawing
one
of
the
old
embroidered
stools
close
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
Come
and
sit
down
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Daniel
obeyed
,
and
Sir
Hugo
put
a
gentle
hand
on
his
shoulder
,
looking
at
him
affectionately
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
,
my
boy
?
<EOS>
Have
you
heard
anything
that
has
put
you
out
of
spirits
lately
?
"
  
<EOS>
Daniel
was
determined
not
to
let
the
tears
come
,
but
he
could
not
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
changes
are
painful
when
people
have
been
happy
,
you
know
,
"
said
Sir
Hugo
,
lifting
his
hand
from
the
boy
's
shoulder
to
his
dark
curls
and
rubbing
them
gently
.
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
be
educated
exactly
as
I
wish
you
to
be
without
our
parting
.
<EOS>
And
I
think
you
will
find
a
great
deal
to
like
at
school
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
not
what
Daniel
expected
,
and
was
so
far
a
relief
,
which
gave
him
spirit
to
answer
    
<EOS>
"
Am
I
to
go
to
school
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
mean
you
to
go
to
Eton
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
to
have
the
education
of
an
English
gentleman
;
and
for
that
it
is
necessary
that
you
should
go
to
a
public
school
in
preparation
for
the
university
:
<EOS>
Cambridge
<EOS>
I
mean
you
to
go
to
;
it
was
my
own
university
.
"
  
<EOS>
Daniel
's
color
came
and
went
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
say
,
sirrah
?
"
said
Sir
Hugo
,
smiling
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
be
a
gentleman
,
"
said
Daniel
,
with
firm
distinctness
,
"
and
go
to
school
,
if
that
is
what
a
gentleman
's
son
must
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
watched
him
silently
for
a
few
moments
,
thinking
he
understood
now
why
the
lad
had
seemed
angry
at
the
notion
of
becoming
a
singer
.
<EOS>
Then
he
said
tenderly
    
"
<EOS>
And
so
you
wo
n't
mind
about
leaving
your
old
Nunc
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
shall
,
"
said
Daniel
,
clasping
Sir
Hugo
's
caressing
arm
with
both
his
hands
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
sha
n't
I
come
home
and
be
with
you
in
the
holidays
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
generally
,
"
said
Sir
Hugo
.
<EOS>
"
But
now
I
mean
you
to
go
at
once
to
a
new
tutor
,
to
break
the
change
for
you
before
you
go
to
Eton
.
"
  
<EOS>
After
this
interview
Daniel
's
spirit
rose
again
.
<EOS>
He
was
meant
to
be
a
gentleman
,
and
in
some
unaccountable
way
it
might
be
that
his
conjectures
were
all
wrong
.
<EOS>
The
very
keenness
of
the
lad
taught
him
to
find
comfort
in
his
ignorance
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
busying
his
mind
in
the
construction
of
possibilities
,
it
became
plain
to
him
that
there
must
be
possibilities
of
which
he
knew
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
left
off
brooding
,
young
joy
and
the
spirit
of
adventure
not
being
easily
quenched
within
him
,
and
in
the
interval
before
his
going
away
<EOS>
he
sang
about
the
house
,
danced
among
the
old
servants
,
making
them
parting
gifts
,
and
insisted
many
times
to
the
groom
on
the
care
that
was
to
be
taken
of
the
black
pony
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
I
shall
know
much
less
than
the
other
boys
,
Mr.
Fraser
?
"
said
Daniel
.
<EOS>
It
was
his
bent
to
think
that
every
stranger
would
be
surprised
at
his
ignorance
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
are
dunces
to
be
found
everywhere
,
"
said
the
judicious
Fraser
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
not
be
the
biggest
;
but
you
've
not
the
makings
of
a
Porson
in
you
,
or
a
Leibnitz
either
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
to
be
a
Porson
or
a
Leibnitz
,
"
said
Daniel
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
be
a
greater
leader
,
like
Pericles
or
Washington
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
;
you
've
a
notion
they
did
with
little
parsing
,
and
less
algebra
,
"
said
Fraser
.
<EOS>
But
in
reality
he
thought
his
pupil
a
remarkable
lad
,
to
whom
one
thing
was
as
easy
as
another
,
if
he
had
only
a
mind
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
Things
went
on
very
well
with
Daniel
in
his
new
world
,
except
that
a
boy
with
whom
he
was
at
once
inclined
to
strike
up
a
close
friendship
talked
to
him
a
great
deal
about
his
home
and
parents
,
and
seemed
to
expect
a
like
expansiveness
in
return
.
<EOS>
Daniel
immediately
shrank
into
reserve
,
and
this
experience
remained
a
check
on
his
naturally
strong
bent
toward
the
formation
of
intimate
friendship
.
<EOS>
Every
one
,
his
tutor
included
,
set
him
down
as
a
reserved
boy
,
though
he
was
so
good
-
humored
and
unassuming
,
as
well
as
quick
,
both
at
study
and
sport
,
that
nobody
called
his
reserve
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
Certainly
his
face
had
a
great
deal
to
do
with
that
favorable
interpretation
;
but
in
this
instance
the
beauty
of
the
closed
lips
told
no
falsehood
.
  
<EOS>
A
surprise
that
came
to
him
before
his
first
vacation
strengthened
the
silent
consciousness
of
a
grief
within
,
which
might
be
compared
in
some
ways
with
Byron
's
susceptibility
about
his
deformed
foot
.
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
wrote
word
that
he
was
married
to
Miss
Raymond
,
a
sweet
lady
,
whom
Daniel
must
remember
having
seen
.
<EOS>
The
event
would
make
no
difference
about
his
spending
the
vacation
at
the
Abbey
;
he
would
find
Lady
Mallinger
a
new
friend
whom
he
would
be
sure
to
love
 
and
much
more
to
the
usual
effect
when
a
man
,
having
done
something
agreeable
to
himself
,
is
disposed
to
congratulate
others
on
his
own
good
fortune
,
and
the
deducible
satisfactoriness
of
events
in
general
.
  
<EOS>
Let
Sir
Hugo
be
partly
excused
until
the
grounds
of
his
action
can
be
more
fully
known
.
<EOS>
The
mistakes
in
his
behavior
to
Deronda
were
due
to
that
dullness
toward
what
may
be
going
on
in
other
minds
,
especially
the
minds
of
children
,
which
is
among
the
commonest
deficiencies
,
even
in
good
-
natured
men
like
him
,
when
life
has
been
generally
easy
to
themselves
,
and
their
energies
have
been
quietly
spent
in
feeling
gratified
.
<EOS>
No
one
was
better
aware
than
he
that
Daniel
was
generally
suspected
to
be
his
own
son
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
pleased
with
that
suspicion
;
and
his
imagination
had
never
once
been
troubled
with
the
way
in
which
the
boy
himself
might
be
affected
,
either
then
or
in
the
future
,
by
the
enigmatic
aspect
of
his
circumstances
.
<EOS>
He
was
as
fond
of
him
as
could
be
,
and
meant
the
best
by
him
.
<EOS>
And
,
considering
the
lightness
with
which
the
preparation
of
young
lives
seem
to
lie
on
respectable
consciences
,
Sir
Hugo
Mallinger
can
hardly
be
held
open
to
exceptional
reproach
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
a
bachelor
till
he
was
five
-
and
-
forty
,
had
always
been
regarded
as
a
fascinating
man
of
elegant
tastes
;
what
could
be
more
natural
,
even
according
to
the
index
of
language
,
than
that
he
should
have
a
beautiful
boy
like
the
little
Deronda
to
take
care
of
?
<EOS>
The
mother
might
even
,
perhaps
,
be
in
the
great
world
 
met
with
in
Sir
Hugo
's
residence
abroad
.
<EOS>
The
only
person
to
feel
any
objection
was
the
boy
himself
,
who
could
not
have
been
consulted
.
<EOS>
And
the
boy
's
objections
had
never
been
dreamed
of
by
anybody
but
himself
.
  
<EOS>
By
the
time
Deronda
was
ready
to
go
to
Cambridge
,
Lady
Mallinger
had
already
three
daughters
 
charming
babies
,
all
three
,
but
whose
sex
was
announced
as
a
melancholy
alternative
,
the
offspring
desired
being
a
son
;
if
Sir
Hugo
had
no
son
the
succession
must
go
to
his
nephew
,
Mallinger
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
Daniel
no
longer
held
a
wavering
opinion
about
his
own
birth
.
<EOS>
His
fuller
knowledge
had
tended
to
convince
him
that
Sir
Hugo
was
his
father
,
and
he
conceived
that
the
baronet
,
since
he
never
approached
a
communication
on
the
subject
,
wished
him
to
have
a
tacit
understanding
of
the
fact
,
and
to
accept
in
silence
what
would
be
generally
considered
more
than
the
due
love
and
nurture
.
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
's
marriage
might
certainly
have
been
felt
as
a
new
ground
of
resentment
by
some
youths
in
Deronda
's
position
,
and
the
timid
Lady
Mallinger
with
her
fast
-
coming
little
ones
might
have
been
images
to
scowl
at
,
as
likely
to
divert
much
that
was
disposable
in
the
feelings
and
possessions
of
the
baronet
from
one
who
felt
his
own
claim
to
be
prior
.
<EOS>
But
hatred
of
innocent
human
obstacles
was
a
form
of
moral
stupidity
not
in
Deronda
's
grain
;
even
the
indignation
which
had
long
mingled
itself
with
his
affection
for
Sir
Hugo
took
the
quality
of
pain
rather
than
of
temper
;
and
as
his
mind
ripened
to
the
idea
of
tolerance
toward
error
,
he
habitually
liked
the
idea
with
his
own
silent
grievances
.
  
<EOS>
The
sense
of
an
entailed
disadvantage
 
the
deformed
foot
doubtfully
hidden
by
the
shoe
,
makes
a
restlessly
active
spiritual
yeast
,
and
easily
turns
a
self
-
centered
,
unloving
nature
into
an
Ishmaelite
.
<EOS>
But
in
the
rarer
sort
,
who
presently
see
their
own
frustrated
claim
as
one
among
a
myriad
,
the
inexorable
sorrow
takes
the
form
of
fellowship
and
makes
the
imagination
tender
.
<EOS>
Deronda
's
early
-
weakened
susceptibility
,
charged
at
first
with
ready
indignation
and
resistant
pride
,
had
raised
in
him
a
premature
reflection
on
certain
questions
of
life
;
it
had
given
a
bias
to
his
conscience
,
a
sympathy
with
certain
ills
,
and
a
tension
of
resolve
in
certain
directions
,
who
marked
him
off
from
other
youths
much
more
than
any
talents
he
possessed
.
  
<EOS>
One
day
near
the
end
of
the
long
vacation
,
when
he
had
been
making
a
tour
in
the
Rhineland
with
his
Eton
tutor
,
and
was
come
for
a
farewell
stay
at
the
Abbey
before
going
to
Cambridge
,
he
said
to
Sir
Hugo
    
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
intend
me
to
be
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
They
were
in
the
library
,
and
it
was
the
fresh
morning
.
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
had
called
him
in
to
read
a
letter
from
a
Cambridge
Don
who
was
to
be
interested
in
him
;
and
since
the
baronet
wore
an
air
at
once
business
-
like
and
leisurely
,
the
moment
seemed
propitious
for
entering
on
a
grave
subject
which
had
never
yet
been
thoroughly
discussed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Whatever
your
inclination
leads
you
to
,
my
boy
.
<EOS>
I
thought
it
right
to
give
you
the
option
of
the
army
,
but
you
shut
the
door
on
that
,
and
I
was
glad
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
expect
you
to
choose
just
yet
 
by
-
and
-
by
,
when
you
have
looked
about
you
a
little
more
and
tried
your
mettle
among
older
men
.
<EOS>
The
university
has
a
good
wide
opening
into
the
forum
.
<EOS>
There
are
prizes
to
be
won
,
and
a
bit
of
good
fortune
often
gives
the
turn
to
a
man
's
taste
.
<EOS>
From
what
I
see
and
hear
,
I
should
think
you
can
take
up
anything
you
like
.
<EOS>
You
are
in
the
deeper
water
with
your
classics
than
I
ever
got
into
,
and
if
you
are
rather
sick
of
that
swimming
,
Cambridge
is
the
place
where
you
can
go
into
mathematics
with
a
will
,
and
disport
yourself
on
the
dry
sand
as
much
as
you
like
.
<EOS>
I
floundered
along
like
a
carp
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
money
will
make
some
difference
,
sir
,
"
said
Daniel
blushing
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
have
to
keep
myself
by
-
and
-
by
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
exactly
.
<EOS>
I
recommend
you
not
to
be
extravagant
 
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
,
I
know
 
<EOS>
you
are
not
inclined
to
that
;
 
but
you
need
not
take
up
anything
against
the
grain
.
<EOS>
You
will
have
a
bachelor
's
income
 
enough
for
you
to
look
about
with
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
had
better
tell
you
that
you
may
consider
yourself
secure
of
seven
hundred
a
year
.
<EOS>
You
might
make
yourself
a
barrister
 
<EOS>
be
a
writer
 
<EOS>
take
up
politics
.
<EOS>
I
confess
that
is
what
would
please
me
best
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
have
you
at
my
elbow
and
pulling
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
looked
embarrassed
.
<EOS>
He
felt
that
he
ought
to
make
some
sign
of
gratitude
,
but
other
feelings
clogged
his
tongue
.
<EOS>
A
moment
was
passing
by
in
which
a
question
about
his
birth
was
throbbing
within
him
,
and
yet
it
seemed
more
impossible
than
ever
that
the
question
should
find
vent
 
more
impossible
than
ever
that
he
could
hear
certain
things
from
Sir
Hugo
's
lips
.
<EOS>
The
liberal
way
in
which
he
was
dealt
with
was
the
more
striking
because
the
baronet
had
of
late
cared
particularly
for
money
,
and
for
making
the
utmost
of
his
life
-
interest
in
the
estate
by
way
of
providing
for
his
daughters
;
and
as
all
this
flashed
through
Daniel
's
mind
<EOS>
it
was
momentarily
within
his
imagination
that
the
provision
for
him
might
come
in
some
way
from
his
mother
.
<EOS>
But
such
vaporous
conjecture
passed
away
as
quickly
as
it
came
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
appeared
not
to
notice
anything
peculiar
in
Daniel
's
manner
,
and
presently
went
on
with
his
usual
chatty
liveliness
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
you
have
done
some
good
reading
outside
your
classics
,
and
have
got
a
grip
of
French
and
German
.
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
unless
a
man
can
get
the
prestige
and
income
of
a
Don
and
write
donnish
books
,
it
's
hardly
worth
while
for
him
to
make
a
Greek
and
Latin
machine
of
himself
and
be
able
to
spin
you
out
pages
of
the
Greek
dramatists
at
any
verse
you
'll
give
him
as
a
cue
.
<EOS>
That
's
all
very
fine
,
but
in
practical
life
nobody
does
give
you
the
cue
for
pages
of
Greek
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
it
's
a
nicety
of
conversation
which
I
would
have
you
attend
to
 
much
quotation
of
any
sort
,
even
in
English
is
bad
.
<EOS>
It
tends
to
choke
ordinary
remark
.
<EOS>
One
could
n't
carry
on
life
comfortably
without
a
little
blindness
to
the
fact
that
everything
had
been
said
better
than
we
can
put
it
ourselves
.
<EOS>
But
talking
of
Dons
,
I
have
seen
Dons
make
a
capital
figure
in
society
;
and
occasionally
he
can
shoot
you
down
a
cart
-
load
of
learning
in
the
right
place
,
which
will
tell
in
politics
.
<EOS>
Such
men
are
wanted
;
and
if
you
have
any
turn
for
being
a
Don
,
I
say
nothing
against
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
there
's
not
much
chance
of
that
.
<EOS>
Quicksett
and
Puller
are
both
stronger
than
I
am
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
not
be
much
disappointed
if
I
do
n't
come
out
with
high
honors
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
you
to
do
yourself
credit
,
but
for
God
's
sake
do
n't
come
out
as
a
superior
expensive
kind
of
idiot
,
like
young
Brecon
,
who
got
a
Double
First
,
and
has
been
learning
to
knit
braces
ever
since
.
<EOS>
What
I
wish
you
to
get
is
a
passport
in
life
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
go
against
our
university
system
<EOS>
:
we
want
a
little
disinterested
culture
to
make
head
against
cotton
and
capital
,
especially
in
the
House
.
<EOS>
My
Greek
has
all
evaporated
;
if
I
had
to
construe
a
verse
on
a
sudden
,
I
should
get
an
apoplectic
fit
.
<EOS>
But
it
formed
my
taste
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
my
English
is
the
better
for
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
On
this
point
Daniel
kept
a
respectful
silence
.
<EOS>
The
enthusiastic
belief
in
Sir
Hugo
's
writings
as
a
standard
,
and
in
the
Whigs
as
the
chosen
race
among
politicians
,
had
gradually
vanished
along
with
the
seraphic
boy
's
face
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
been
the
hardest
of
workers
at
Eton
.
<EOS>
Though
some
kinds
of
study
and
reading
came
as
easily
as
boating
to
him
,
he
was
not
of
the
material
that
usually
makes
the
first
-
rate
Eton
scholar
.
<EOS>
There
had
sprung
up
in
him
a
meditative
yearning
after
wide
knowledge
which
is
likely
always
to
abate
ardor
in
the
fight
for
prize
acquirement
in
narrow
tracks
.
<EOS>
Happily
he
was
modest
,
and
took
any
second
-
rateness
in
himself
simply
as
a
fact
,
not
as
a
marvel
necessarily
to
be
accounted
for
by
a
superiority
.
<EOS>
Still
Mr.
Fraser
's
high
opinion
of
the
lad
had
not
been
altogether
belied
by
the
youth
:
Daniel
had
the
stamp
of
rarity
in
a
subdued
fervor
of
sympathy
,
an
activity
of
imagination
on
behalf
of
others
which
did
not
show
itself
effusively
,
but
was
continually
seen
in
acts
of
considerateness
that
struck
his
companions
as
moral
eccentricity
.
<EOS>
"
Deronda
would
have
been
first
-
rate
if
he
had
had
more
ambition
,
"
was
a
frequent
remark
about
him
.
<EOS>
But
how
could
a
fellow
push
his
way
properly
when
he
objected
to
swop
for
his
own
advantage
,
knocked
under
by
choice
when
he
was
within
an
inch
of
victory
,
and
,
unlike
the
great
Clive
,
would
rather
be
the
calf
than
the
butcher
?
<EOS>
It
was
a
mistake
,
however
,
to
suppose
that
Deronda
had
not
his
share
of
ambition
.
<EOS>
We
know
he
had
suffered
keenly
from
the
belief
that
there
was
a
tinge
of
dishonor
in
his
lot
;
but
there
are
some
cases
,
and
his
was
one
of
them
,
in
which
the
sense
of
injury
breeds
 
not
the
will
to
inflict
injuries
and
climb
over
them
as
a
ladder
,
but
a
hatred
of
all
injury
.
<EOS>
He
had
his
flashes
of
fierceness
and
could
hit
out
upon
occasion
,
but
the
occasions
were
not
always
what
might
have
been
expected
.
<EOS>
For
in
what
related
to
himself
his
resentful
impulses
had
been
early
checked
by
a
mastering
affectionateness
.
<EOS>
Love
has
a
habit
of
saying
"
Never
mind
"
to
angry
self
,
who
,
sitting
down
for
the
nonce
in
the
lower
place
,
by
-
and
-
by
gets
used
to
it
.
<EOS>
So
it
was
that
as
Deronda
approached
manhood
his
feeling
for
Sir
Hugo
,
while
it
was
getting
more
and
more
mixed
with
criticism
,
was
gaining
in
that
sort
of
allowance
which
reconciles
criticism
with
tenderness
.
<EOS>
The
dear
old
beautiful
home
and
everything
within
it
,
Lady
Mallinger
and
her
little
ones
included
,
were
consecrated
for
the
youth
as
they
had
been
for
the
boy
 
only
with
a
certain
difference
of
light
on
the
objects
.
<EOS>
The
altarpiece
was
no
longer
miraculously
perfect
,
painted
under
infallible
guidance
,
but
the
human
hand
discerned
in
the
work
was
appealing
to
a
reverent
tenderness
safer
from
the
gusts
of
discovery
.
<EOS>
Certainly
Deronda
's
ambition
,
even
in
his
spring
-
time
,
lay
exceptionally
aloof
from
conspicuous
,
vulgar
triumph
,
and
from
other
ugly
forms
of
boyish
energy
;
perhaps
because
he
was
early
impassioned
by
ideas
,
and
burned
his
fire
on
those
heights
.
<EOS>
One
may
spend
a
good
deal
of
energy
in
disliking
and
resisting
what
others
pursue
,
and
a
boy
who
is
fond
of
somebody
else
's
pencil
-
case
may
not
be
more
energetic
than
another
who
is
fond
of
giving
his
own
pencil
-
case
away
.
<EOS>
Still
it
was
not
Deronda
's
disposition
to
escape
from
ugly
scenes
;
he
was
more
inclined
to
sit
through
them
and
take
care
of
the
fellow
least
able
to
take
care
of
himself
.
<EOS>
It
had
helped
to
make
him
popular
that
he
was
sometimes
a
little
compromised
by
this
apparent
comradeship
.
<EOS>
For
a
meditative
interest
in
learning
how
human
miseries
are
wrought
 
as
precocious
in
him
as
<EOS>
another
sort
of
genius
in
the
poet
who
writes
a
Queen
Mab
at
nineteen
 
was
so
infused
with
kindliness
that
it
easily
passed
for
comradeship
.
<EOS>
Enough
.
<EOS>
In
many
of
our
neighbors
'
lives
there
is
much
not
only
of
error
and
lapse
,
but
of
a
certain
exquisite
goodness
which
can
never
be
written
or
even
spoken
 
only
divined
by
each
of
us
,
according
to
the
inward
instruction
of
our
own
privacy
.
  
<EOS>
The
impression
he
made
at
Cambridge
corresponded
to
his
position
at
Eton
.
<EOS>
Every
one
interested
in
him
agreed
that
he
might
have
taken
a
high
place
if
his
motives
had
been
of
a
more
pushing
sort
,
and
if
he
had
not
,
instead
of
regarding
studies
as
instruments
of
success
,
hampered
himself
with
the
notion
that
they
were
to
feed
motive
and
opinion
 
a
notion
which
set
him
criticising
methods
and
arguing
against
his
freight
and
harness
when
he
should
have
been
using
all
his
might
to
pull
.
<EOS>
In
the
beginning
his
work
at
the
university
had
a
new
zest
for
him
:
indifferent
to
the
continuation
of
Eton
classical
drill
,
he
applied
himself
vigorously
to
mathematics
,
for
which
he
had
shown
an
early
aptitude
under
Mr.
Fraser
,
and
he
had
the
delight
of
feeling
his
strength
in
a
comparatively
fresh
exercise
of
thought
.
<EOS>
That
delight
,
and
the
favorable
opinion
of
his
tutor
,
determined
him
to
try
for
a
mathematical
scholarship
in
the
Easter
of
his
second
year
:
he
wished
to
gratify
Sir
Hugo
by
some
achievement
,
and
the
study
of
the
higher
mathematics
,
having
the
growing
fascination
inherent
in
all
thinking
which
demands
intensity
,
was
making
him
a
more
exclusive
worker
than
he
had
been
before
.
  
<EOS>
But
here
came
the
old
check
which
had
been
growing
with
his
growth
.
<EOS>
He
found
the
inward
bent
toward
comprehension
and
thoroughness
diverging
more
and
more
from
the
track
marked
out
by
the
standards
of
examination
:
he
felt
a
heightening
discontent
with
the
wearing
futility
and
enfeebling
strain
of
a
demand
for
excessive
retention
and
dexterity
without
any
insight
into
the
principles
which
form
the
vital
connections
of
knowledge
.
<EOS>
(
Deronda
's
undergraduateship
occurred
fifteen
years
ago
,
when
the
perfection
of
our
university
methods
was
not
yet
indisputable
.
)
<EOS>
In
hours
when
his
dissatisfaction
was
strong
upon
him
he
reproached
himself
for
having
been
attracted
by
the
conventional
advantage
of
belonging
to
an
English
university
,
and
was
tempted
toward
the
project
of
asking
Sir
Hugo
to
let
him
quit
Cambridge
and
pursue
a
more
independent
line
of
study
abroad
.
<EOS>
The
germs
of
this
inclination
had
been
already
stirring
in
his
boyish
love
of
universal
history
,
which
made
him
want
to
be
at
home
in
foreign
countries
,
and
follow
in
imagination
the
traveling
students
of
the
middle
ages
.
<EOS>
He
longed
now
to
have
the
sort
of
apprenticeship
to
life
which
would
not
shape
him
too
definitely
,
and
rob
him
of
the
choice
that
might
come
from
a
free
growth
.
<EOS>
One
sees
that
Deronda
's
demerits
were
likely
to
be
on
the
side
of
reflective
hesitation
,
and
this
tendency
was
encouraged
by
his
position
;
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
get
an
immediate
income
,
or
to
fit
himself
in
haste
for
a
profession
;
and
his
sensibility
to
the
half
-
known
facts
of
his
parentage
made
him
an
excuse
for
lingering
longer
than
others
in
a
state
of
social
neutrality
.
<EOS>
Other
men
,
he
inwardly
said
,
had
a
more
definite
place
and
duties
.
<EOS>
But
the
project
which
flattered
his
inclination
might
not
have
gone
beyond
the
stage
of
ineffective
brooding
,
if
certain
circumstances
had
not
quickened
it
into
action
.
  
<EOS>
The
circumstances
arose
out
of
an
enthusiastic
friendship
which
extended
into
his
after
-
life
.
<EOS>
Of
the
same
year
with
himself
,
and
occupying
small
rooms
close
to
his
,
was
a
youth
who
had
come
as
an
exhibitioner
from
Christ
's
Hospital
,
and
had
eccentricities
enough
for
a
Charles
Lamb
.
<EOS>
Only
to
look
at
his
pinched
features
and
blonde
hair
hanging
over
his
collar
reminded
one
of
pale
quaint
heads
by
early
German
painters
;
and
when
this
faint
coloring
was
lit
up
by
a
joke
,
there
came
sudden
creases
about
the
mouth
and
eyes
which
might
have
been
moulded
by
the
soul
of
an
aged
humorist
.
<EOS>
His
father
,
an
engraver
of
some
distinction
,
had
been
dead
eleven
years
,
and
his
mother
had
three
girls
to
educate
and
maintain
on
a
meagre
annuity
.
<EOS>
Hans
Meyrick
 
he
had
been
daringly
christened
after
Holbein
 
felt
himself
the
pillar
,
or
rather
the
knotted
and
twisted
trunk
,
round
which
these
feeble
climbing
plants
must
cling
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
want
of
ability
or
of
honest
well
-
meaning
affection
to
make
the
prop
trustworthy
:
<EOS>
the
ease
and
quickness
with
which
he
studied
might
serve
him
to
win
prizes
at
Cambridge
,
as
he
had
done
among
the
Blue
Coats
,
in
spite
of
irregularities
.
<EOS>
The
only
danger
was
,
that
the
incalculable
tendencies
in
him
might
be
fatally
timed
,
and
that
his
good
intentions
might
be
frustrated
by
some
act
which
was
not
due
to
habit
but
to
capricious
,
scattered
impulses
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
be
said
to
have
any
one
bad
habit
;
yet
at
longer
or
shorter
intervals
he
had
fits
of
impish
recklessness
,
and
did
things
that
would
have
made
the
worst
habits
.
  
<EOS>
Hans
in
his
right
mind
,
however
,
was
a
lovable
creature
,
and
in
Deronda
he
had
happened
to
find
a
friend
who
was
likely
to
stand
by
him
with
the
more
constancy
,
from
compassion
for
these
brief
aberrations
that
might
bring
a
long
repentance
.
<EOS>
Hans
,
indeed
,
shared
Deronda
's
rooms
nearly
as
much
as
he
used
his
own
:
to
Deronda
he
poured
himself
out
on
his
studies
,
his
affairs
,
his
hopes
;
the
poverty
of
his
home
,
and
his
love
for
the
creatures
there
;
the
itching
of
his
fingers
to
draw
,
and
his
determination
to
fight
it
away
for
the
sake
of
getting
some
sort
of
a
plum
that
he
might
divide
with
his
mother
and
the
girls
.
<EOS>
He
wanted
no
confidence
in
return
,
but
seemed
to
take
Deronda
as
an
Olympian
who
needed
nothing
 
an
egotism
in
friendship
which
is
common
enough
with
mercurial
,
expansive
natures
.
<EOS>
Deronda
was
content
,
and
gave
Meyrick
all
the
interest
he
claimed
,
getting
at
last
a
brotherly
anxiety
about
him
,
looking
after
him
in
his
erratic
moments
,
and
contriving
by
adroitly
delicate
devices
not
only
to
make
up
for
his
friend
's
lack
of
pence
,
but
to
save
him
from
threatening
chances
.
<EOS>
Such
friendship
easily
becomes
tender
:
the
one
spreads
strong
sheltering
wings
that
delight
in
spreading
,
the
other
gets
the
warm
protection
which
is
also
a
delight
.
<EOS>
Meyrick
was
going
in
for
a
classical
scholarship
,
and
his
success
,
in
various
ways
momentous
,
was
the
more
probable
from
the
steadying
influence
of
Deronda
's
friendship
.
  
<EOS>
But
an
imprudence
of
Meyrick
's
,
committed
at
the
beginning
of
the
autumn
term
,
threatened
to
disappoint
his
hopes
.
<EOS>
With
his
usual
alternation
between
unnecessary
expense
and
self
-
privation
,
he
had
given
too
much
money
for
an
old
engraving
which
fascinated
him
,
and
to
make
up
for
it
,
had
come
from
London
in
a
third
-
class
carriage
with
his
eyes
exposed
to
a
bitter
wind
and
any
irritating
particles
the
wind
might
drive
before
it
.
<EOS>
The
consequence
was
a
severe
inflammation
of
the
eyes
,
which
for
some
time
hung
over
him
the
threat
of
a
lasting
injury
.
<EOS>
This
crushing
trouble
called
out
all
Deronda
's
readiness
to
devote
himself
,
and
he
made
every
other
occupation
secondary
to
that
of
being
companion
and
eyes
to
Hans
,
working
with
him
and
for
him
at
his
classics
,
that
if
possible
his
chance
of
the
classical
scholarship
might
be
saved
.
<EOS>
Hans
,
to
keep
the
knowledge
of
his
suffering
from
his
mother
and
sisters
,
alleged
his
work
as
a
reason
for
passing
the
Christmas
at
Cambridge
,
and
his
friend
stayed
up
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
Deronda
relaxed
his
hold
on
his
mathematics
,
and
Hans
,
reflecting
on
this
,
at
length
said
:
"
<EOS>
Old
fellow
,
while
you
are
hoisting
me
you
are
risking
yourself
.
<EOS>
With
your
mathematical
cram
one
may
be
like
Moses
or
Mahomet
or
somebody
of
that
sort
who
had
to
cram
,
and
forgot
in
one
day
what
it
had
taken
him
forty
to
learn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
would
not
admit
that
he
cared
about
the
risk
,
and
he
had
really
been
beguiled
into
a
little
indifference
by
double
sympathy
:
he
was
very
anxious
that
Hans
should
not
miss
the
much
-
needed
scholarship
,
and
he
felt
a
revival
of
interest
in
the
old
studies
.
<EOS>
Still
,
when
Hans
,
rather
late
in
the
day
,
got
able
to
use
his
own
eyes
,
Deronda
had
tenacity
enough
to
try
hard
and
recover
his
lost
ground
.
<EOS>
He
failed
,
however
;
but
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
Meyrick
win
.
  
<EOS>
Success
,
as
a
sort
of
beginning
that
urged
completion
,
might
have
reconciled
Deronda
to
his
university
course
;
but
the
emptiness
of
all
things
,
from
politics
to
pastimes
,
is
never
so
striking
to
us
as
when
we
fail
in
them
.
<EOS>
The
loss
of
the
personal
triumph
had
no
severity
for
him
,
but
the
sense
of
having
spent
his
time
ineffectively
in
a
mode
of
working
which
had
been
against
the
grain
,
gave
him
a
distaste
for
any
renewal
of
the
process
,
which
turned
his
imagined
project
of
quitting
Cambridge
into
a
serious
intention
.
<EOS>
In
speaking
of
his
intention
to
Meyrick
he
made
it
appear
that
he
was
glad
of
the
turn
events
had
taken
 
glad
to
have
the
balance
dip
decidedly
,
and
feel
freed
from
his
hesitations
;
but
he
observed
that
he
must
of
course
submit
to
any
strong
objection
on
the
part
of
Sir
Hugo
.
  
<EOS>
Meyrick
's
joy
and
gratitude
were
disturbed
by
much
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
He
believed
in
Deronda
's
alleged
preference
,
but
he
felt
keenly
that
in
serving
him
Daniel
had
placed
himself
at
a
disadvantage
in
Sir
Hugo
's
opinion
,
and
he
said
mournfully
,
"
If
you
had
got
the
scholarship
,
Sir
Hugo
would
have
thought
that
you
asked
to
leave
us
with
a
better
grace
.
<EOS>
You
have
spoiled
your
luck
for
my
sake
,
and
I
can
do
nothing
to
amend
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
you
can
;
you
are
to
be
a
first
-
rate
fellow
.
<EOS>
I
call
that
a
first
-
rate
investment
of
my
luck
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
confound
it
!
<EOS>
You
save
an
ugly
mongrel
from
drowning
,
and
expect
him
to
cut
a
fine
figure
.
<EOS>
The
poets
have
made
tragedies
enough
about
signing
one
's
self
over
to
wickedness
for
the
sake
of
getting
something
plummy
;
I
shall
write
a
tragedy
of
a
fellow
who
signed
himself
over
to
be
good
,
and
was
uncomfortable
ever
after
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
Hans
lost
no
time
in
secretly
writing
the
history
of
the
affair
to
Sir
Hugo
,
making
it
plain
that
but
for
Deronda
's
generous
devotion
he
could
hardly
have
failed
to
win
the
prize
he
had
been
working
for
.
  
<EOS>
The
two
friends
went
up
to
town
together
:
Meyrick
to
rejoice
with
his
mother
and
the
girls
in
their
little
home
at
Chelsea
;
Deronda
to
carry
out
the
less
easy
task
of
opening
his
mind
to
Sir
Hugo
.
<EOS>
He
relied
a
little
on
the
baronet
's
general
tolerance
of
eccentricities
,
but
he
expected
more
opposition
than
he
met
with
.
<EOS>
He
was
received
with
even
warmer
kindness
than
usual
,
the
failure
was
passed
over
lightly
,
and
when
he
detailed
his
reasons
for
wishing
to
quit
the
university
and
go
to
study
abroad
.
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
sat
for
some
time
in
a
silence
which
was
rather
meditative
than
surprised
.
<EOS>
At
last
he
said
,
looking
at
Daniel
with
examination
,
"
So
you
do
n't
want
to
be
an
Englishman
to
the
backbone
after
all
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
be
an
Englishman
,
but
I
want
to
understand
other
points
of
view
.
<EOS>
And
I
want
to
get
rid
of
a
merely
English
attitude
in
studies
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
;
you
do
n't
want
to
be
turned
out
in
the
same
mould
as
every
other
youngster
.
<EOS>
And
I
have
nothing
to
say
against
your
doffing
some
of
our
national
prejudices
.
<EOS>
I
feel
the
better
myself
for
having
spent
a
good
deal
of
my
time
abroad
.
<EOS>
But
,
for
God
's
sake
,
keep
an
English
cut
,
and
do
n't
become
indifferent
to
bad
tobacco
!
<EOS>
And
,
my
dear
boy
,
it
is
good
to
be
unselfish
and
generous
;
but
do
n't
carry
that
too
far
.
<EOS>
It
will
not
do
to
give
yourself
to
be
melted
down
for
the
benefit
of
the
tallow
-
trade
;
you
must
know
where
to
find
yourself
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
shall
put
no
vote
on
your
going
.
<EOS>
Wait
until
I
can
get
off
Committee
,
and
I
'll
run
over
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
So
Deronda
went
according
to
his
will
.
<EOS>
But
not
before
he
had
spent
some
hours
with
Hans
Meyrick
,
and
been
introduced
to
the
mother
and
sisters
in
the
Chelsea
home
.
<EOS>
The
shy
girls
watched
and
registered
every
look
of
their
brother
's
friend
,
declared
by
Hans
to
have
been
the
salvation
of
him
,
a
fellow
like
nobody
else
,
and
,
in
fine
,
a
brick
.
<EOS>
They
so
thoroughly
accepted
Deronda
as
an
ideal
,
that
when
he
was
gone
the
youngest
set
to
work
,
under
the
criticism
of
the
two
elder
girls
,
to
paint
him
as
Prince
Camaralzaman
.
            
<EOS>
"
This
is
truth
the
poet
sings
,
  
That
a
sorrow
's
crown
of
sorrow
is
remembering
happier
things
.

TENNYSON
:
_
Locksley
Hall
_
.
   
<EOS>
On
a
fine
evening
near
the
end
of
July
,
Deronda
was
rowing
himself
on
the
Thames
.
<EOS>
It
was
already
a
year
or
more
since
he
had
come
back
to
England
,
with
the
understanding
that
his
education
was
finished
,
and
that
he
was
somehow
to
take
his
place
in
English
society
;
but
though
,
in
deference
to
Sir
Hugo
's
wish
,
and
to
fence
off
idleness
,
he
had
began
to
read
law
,
this
apparent
decision
had
been
without
other
result
than
to
deepen
the
roots
of
indecision
.
<EOS>
His
old
love
of
boating
had
revived
with
the
more
force
now
that
he
was
in
town
with
the
Mallingers
,
because
he
could
nowhere
else
get
the
same
still
seclusion
which
the
river
gave
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
boat
of
his
own
at
Putney
,
and
whenever
Sir
Hugo
did
not
want
him
,
it
was
his
chief
holiday
to
row
till
past
sunset
and
come
in
again
with
the
stars
.
<EOS>
Not
that
he
was
in
a
sentimental
stage
;
but
he
was
in
another
sort
of
contemplative
mood
perhaps
more
common
in
the
young
men
of
our
day
 
that
of
questioning
whether
it
were
worth
while
to
take
part
in
the
battle
of
the
world
:
<EOS>
I
mean
,
of
course
,
the
young
men
in
whom
the
unproductive
labor
of
questioning
is
sustained
by
three
or
five
per
cent
,
on
capital
which
somebody
else
has
battled
for
.
<EOS>
It
puzzled
Sir
Hugo
that
one
who
made
a
splendid
contrast
with
all
that
was
sickly
and
puling
should
be
hampered
with
ideas
which
,
since
they
left
an
accomplished
Whig
like
himself
unobstructed
,
could
be
no
better
than
spectral
illusions
;
especially
as
Deronda
set
himself
against
authorship
 
a
vocation
which
is
understood
to
turn
foolish
thinking
into
funds
.
  
<EOS>
Rowing
in
his
dark
-
blue
shirt
and
skull
-
cap
,
his
curls
closely
clipped
,
his
mouth
beset
with
abundant
soft
waves
of
beard
,
he
bore
only
disguised
traces
of
the
seraphic
boy
"
trailing
clouds
of
glory
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Still
,
even
one
who
had
never
seen
him
since
his
boyhood
might
have
looked
at
him
with
slow
recognition
,
due
perhaps
to
the
peculiarity
of
the
gaze
which
Gwendolen
chose
to
call
"
dreadful
,
"
though
it
had
really
a
very
mild
sort
of
scrutiny
.
<EOS>
The
voice
,
sometimes
audible
in
subdued
snatches
of
song
,
had
turned
out
merely
a
high
baritone
;
indeed
,
only
to
look
at
his
lithe
,
powerful
frame
and
the
firm
gravity
of
his
face
would
have
been
enough
for
an
experienced
guess
that
he
had
no
rare
and
ravishing
tenor
such
as
nature
reluctantly
makes
at
some
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
Look
at
his
hands
:
they
are
not
small
and
dimpled
,
with
tapering
fingers
that
seem
to
have
only
a
deprecating
touch
:
they
are
long
,
flexible
,
firmly
-
grasping
hands
,
such
as
Titian
has
painted
in
a
picture
where
he
wanted
to
show
the
combination
of
refinement
with
force
.
<EOS>
And
there
is
something
of
a
likeness
,
too
,
between
the
faces
belonging
to
the
hands
 
in
both
the
uniform
pale
-
brown
skin
,
the
perpendicular
brow
,
the
calmly
penetrating
eyes
.
<EOS>
Not
seraphic
any
longer
:
thoroughly
terrestrial
and
manly
;
but
still
of
a
kind
to
raise
belief
in
a
human
dignity
which
can
afford
to
recognize
poor
relations
.
  
<EOS>
Such
types
meet
us
here
and
there
among
average
conditions
;
in
a
workman
,
for
example
,
whistling
over
a
bit
of
measurement
and
lifting
his
eyes
to
answer
our
question
about
the
road
.
<EOS>
And
often
the
grand
meanings
of
faces
as
well
as
of
written
words
may
lie
chiefly
in
the
impressions
that
happen
just
now
to
be
of
importance
in
relation
to
Deronda
,
rowing
on
the
Thames
in
a
very
ordinary
equipment
for
a
young
Englishman
at
leisure
,
and
passing
under
Kew
Bridge
with
no
thought
of
an
adventure
in
which
his
appearance
was
likely
to
play
any
part
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
he
objected
very
strongly
to
the
notion
,
which
others
had
not
allowed
him
to
escape
,
that
his
appearance
was
of
a
kind
to
draw
attention
;
and
hints
of
this
,
intended
to
be
complimentary
,
found
an
angry
resonance
in
him
,
coming
from
mingled
experiences
,
to
which
a
clue
has
already
been
given
.
<EOS>
His
own
face
in
the
glass
had
during
many
years
associated
for
him
with
thoughts
of
some
one
whom
he
must
be
like
 
one
about
whose
character
and
lot
he
continually
wondered
,
and
never
dared
to
ask
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
neighborhood
of
Kew
Bridge
,
between
six
and
seven
o'clock
,
the
river
was
no
solitude
.
<EOS>
Several
persons
were
sauntering
on
the
towing
-
path
,
and
here
and
there
a
boat
was
plying
.
<EOS>
Deronda
had
been
rowing
fast
to
get
over
this
spot
,
when
,
becoming
aware
of
a
great
barge
advancing
toward
him
,
he
guided
his
boat
aside
,
and
rested
on
his
oar
within
a
couple
of
yards
of
the
river
-
brink
.
<EOS>
He
was
all
the
while
unconsciously
continuing
the
low
-
toned
chant
which
had
haunted
his
throat
all
the
way
up
the
river
 
<EOS>
the
gondolier
's
song
in
the
"
Otello
,
"
where
Rossini
has
worthily
set
to
music
the
immortal
words
of
Dante
              
"
Nessun
maggior
dolore
  
<EOS>
Che
ricordarsi
del
tempo
felice
  
Nella
miseria
"
:
[
Footnote
:
Dante
's
words
are
best
rendered
by
our
own
poet
in
the
lines
at
the
head
of
the
chapter
.
]
  
<EOS>
and
,
as
he
rested
on
his
oar
,
the
pianissimo
fall
of
the
melodic
wail
"
nella
miseria
"
was
distinctly
audible
on
the
brink
of
the
water
.
<EOS>
Three
or
four
persons
had
paused
at
various
spots
to
watch
the
barge
passing
the
bridge
,
and
doubtless
included
in
their
notice
the
young
gentleman
in
the
boat
;
but
probably
it
was
only
to
one
ear
that
the
low
vocal
sounds
came
with
more
significance
than
if
they
had
been
an
insect
-
murmur
amidst
the
sum
of
current
noises
.
<EOS>
Deronda
,
awaiting
the
barge
,
now
turning
his
head
to
the
river
-
side
,
and
saw
at
a
few
yards
'
distant
from
him
a
figure
which
might
have
been
an
impersonation
of
the
misery
he
was
unconsciously
giving
voice
to
:
a
girl
hardly
more
than
eighteen
,
of
low
slim
figure
,
with
most
delicate
little
face
,
her
dark
curls
pushed
behind
her
ears
under
a
large
black
hat
,
a
long
woolen
cloak
over
her
shoulders
.
<EOS>
Her
hands
were
hanging
down
clasped
before
her
,
and
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
river
with
a
look
of
immovable
,
statue
-
like
despair
.
<EOS>
This
strong
arrest
of
his
attention
made
him
cease
singing
:
apparently
his
voice
had
entered
her
inner
world
without
her
taking
any
note
of
whence
<EOS>
it
came
,
for
when
it
suddenly
ceased
she
changed
her
attitude
slightly
,
and
,
looking
round
with
a
frightened
glance
,
met
Deronda
's
face
.
<EOS>
It
was
but
a
couple
of
moments
,
but
that
seemed
a
long
while
for
two
people
to
look
straight
at
each
other
.
<EOS>
Her
look
was
something
like
that
of
a
fawn
or
other
gentle
animal
before
it
turns
to
run
away
:
no
blush
,
no
special
alarm
,
but
only
some
timidity
which
yet
could
not
hinder
her
from
a
long
look
before
she
turned
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
it
seemed
to
Deronda
that
she
was
only
half
conscious
of
her
surroundings
:
was
she
hungry
,
or
was
there
some
other
cause
of
bewilderment
?
<EOS>
He
felt
an
outleap
of
interest
and
compassion
toward
her
;
but
the
next
instant
she
had
turned
and
walked
away
to
a
neighboring
bench
under
a
tree
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
right
to
linger
and
watch
her
:
poorly
-
dressed
,
melancholy
women
are
common
sights
;
it
was
only
the
delicate
beauty
,
picturesque
lines
and
color
of
the
image
that
was
exceptional
,
and
these
conditions
made
it
more
markedly
impossible
that
he
should
obtrude
his
interest
upon
her
.
<EOS>
He
began
to
row
away
and
was
soon
far
up
the
river
;
but
no
other
thoughts
were
busy
enough
quite
to
expel
that
pale
image
of
unhappy
girlhood
.
<EOS>
He
fell
again
and
again
to
speculating
on
the
probable
romance
that
lay
behind
that
loneliness
and
look
of
desolation
;
then
to
smile
at
his
own
share
in
the
prejudice
that
interesting
faces
must
have
interesting
adventures
;
then
to
justify
himself
for
feeling
that
sorrow
was
the
more
tragic
when
it
befell
delicate
,
childlike
beauty
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
have
forgotten
the
look
of
misery
if
she
had
been
ugly
and
vulgar
,
"
he
said
to
himself
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
denying
that
the
attractiveness
of
the
image
made
it
likelier
to
last
.
<EOS>
It
was
clear
to
him
as
an
onyx
cameo
;
the
brown
-
black
drapery
,
the
white
face
with
small
,
small
features
and
dark
,
long
-
lashed
eyes
.
<EOS>
His
mind
glanced
over
the
girl
-
tragedies
that
are
going
on
in
the
world
,
hidden
,
unheeded
,
as
if
they
were
but
tragedies
of
the
copse
or
hedgerow
,
where
the
helpless
drag
wounded
wings
forsakenly
,
and
streak
the
shadowed
moss
with
the
red
moment
-
hand
of
their
own
death
.
<EOS>
Deronda
of
late
,
in
his
solitary
excursions
,
had
been
occupied
chiefly
with
uncertainties
about
his
own
course
;
but
those
uncertainties
,
being
much
at
their
leisure
,
were
wo
nt
to
have
such
wide
-
sweeping
connections
with
all
life
and
history
that
the
new
image
of
helpless
sorrow
easily
blent
itself
with
what
seemed
to
him
the
strong
array
of
reasons
why
he
should
shrink
from
getting
into
that
routine
of
the
world
which
makes
men
apologize
for
all
its
wrong
-
doing
,
and
take
opinions
as
mere
professional
equipment
 
why
he
should
not
draw
strongly
at
any
thread
in
the
hopelessly
-
entangled
scheme
of
things
.
  
<EOS>
He
used
his
oars
little
,
satisfied
to
go
with
the
tide
and
be
taken
back
by
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
his
habit
to
indulge
himself
in
that
solemn
passivity
which
easily
comes
with
the
lengthening
shadows
and
mellow
light
,
when
thinking
and
desiring
melt
together
imperceptibly
,
and
what
in
other
hours
may
have
seemed
argument
takes
the
quality
of
passionate
vision
.
<EOS>
By
the
time
he
had
come
back
again
with
the
tide
past
Richmond
Bridge
<EOS>
the
sun
was
near
setting
:
and
the
approach
of
his
favorite
hour
 
with
its
deepening
stillness
and
darkening
masses
of
tree
and
building
between
the
double
glow
of
the
sky
and
the
river
 
disposed
him
to
linger
as
if
they
had
been
an
unfinished
strain
of
music
.
<EOS>
He
looked
out
for
a
perfectly
solitary
spot
where
he
could
lodge
his
boat
against
the
bank
,
and
,
throwing
himself
on
his
back
with
his
head
propped
on
the
cushions
,
could
watch
out
the
light
of
sunset
and
the
opening
of
that
bead
-
roll
which
some
oriental
poet
describes
as
God
's
call
to
the
little
stars
,
who
each
answer
,
"
Here
am
I.
"
<EOS>
He
chose
a
spot
in
the
bend
of
the
river
just
opposite
Kew
Gardens
,
where
he
had
a
great
breadth
of
water
before
him
reflecting
the
glory
of
the
sky
,
while
he
himself
was
in
shadow
.
<EOS>
He
lay
with
his
hands
behind
his
head
,
propped
on
a
level
with
the
boat
's
edge
,
so
that
he
could
see
all
round
him
,
but
could
not
be
seen
by
any
one
at
a
few
yards
'
distance
;
and
for
a
long
while
he
never
turned
his
eyes
from
the
view
right
in
front
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
forgetting
everything
else
in
a
half
-
speculative
,
half
-
involuntary
identification
of
himself
with
the
objects
he
was
looking
at
,
thinking
how
far
it
might
be
possible
habitually
to
shift
his
centre
till
his
own
personality
would
be
no
less
outside
him
than
the
landscape
 
when
the
sense
of
something
moving
on
the
bank
opposite
him
where
it
was
bordered
by
a
line
of
willow
bushes
,
made
him
turn
his
glance
thitherward
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
moment
he
had
a
darting
presentiment
about
the
moving
figure
;
and
now
he
could
see
the
small
face
with
the
strange
dying
sunlight
upon
it
.
<EOS>
He
feared
to
frighten
her
by
a
sudden
movement
,
and
watched
her
with
motionless
attention
.
<EOS>
She
looked
round
,
but
seemed
only
to
gather
security
from
the
apparent
solitude
,
hid
her
hat
among
the
willows
,
and
immediately
took
off
her
woolen
cloak
.
<EOS>
Presently
she
seated
herself
and
deliberately
dipped
the
cloak
in
the
water
,
holding
it
there
a
little
while
,
then
taking
it
out
with
effort
,
rising
from
her
seat
as
she
did
so
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
Deronda
felt
sure
that
she
meant
to
wrap
the
wet
cloak
round
her
as
a
drowning
shroud
;
there
was
no
longer
time
to
hesitate
about
frightening
her
.
<EOS>
He
rose
and
seized
his
oar
to
ply
across
;
happily
her
position
lay
a
little
below
him
.
<EOS>
The
poor
thing
,
overcome
with
terror
at
this
sign
of
discovery
from
the
opposite
bank
,
sank
down
on
the
brink
again
,
holding
her
cloak
half
out
of
the
water
.
<EOS>
She
crouched
and
covered
her
face
as
if
she
kept
a
faint
hope
that
she
had
not
been
seen
,
and
that
the
boatman
was
accidentally
coming
toward
her
.
<EOS>
But
soon
he
was
within
brief
space
of
her
,
steadying
his
boat
against
the
bank
,
and
speaking
,
but
very
gently
    
"
Do
n't
be
afraid
.
<EOS>
You
are
unhappy
.
<EOS>
Pray
,
trust
me
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
what
I
can
do
to
help
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
raised
her
head
and
looked
up
at
him
.
<EOS>
His
face
now
was
toward
the
light
,
and
she
knew
it
again
.
<EOS>
But
she
did
not
speak
for
a
few
moments
which
were
a
renewal
of
their
former
gaze
at
each
other
.
<EOS>
At
last
she
said
in
a
low
sweet
voice
,
with
an
accent
so
distinct
that
it
suggested
foreignness
and
yet
was
not
foreign
,
"
I
saw
you
before
,
"
and
then
added
dreamily
,
after
a
like
pause
,
"
nella
miseria
.
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
,
not
understanding
the
connection
of
her
thoughts
,
supposed
that
her
mind
was
weakened
by
distress
and
hunger
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
you
,
singing
?
<EOS>
"
she
went
on
,
hesitatingly
 
"
Nessun
maggior
dolore
.
<EOS>
"
The
mere
words
themselves
uttered
in
her
sweet
undertones
seemed
to
give
the
melody
to
Deronda
's
ear
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
yes
,
"
he
said
,
understanding
now
,
"
I
am
often
singing
them
.
<EOS>
But
I
fear
you
will
injure
yourself
staying
here
.
<EOS>
Pray
let
me
take
you
in
my
boat
to
some
place
of
safety
.
<EOS>
And
that
wet
cloak
 
let
me
take
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
would
not
attempt
to
take
it
without
her
leave
,
dreading
lest
he
should
scare
her
.
<EOS>
Even
at
his
words
,
he
fancied
that
she
shrank
and
clutched
the
cloak
more
tenaciously
.
<EOS>
But
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
with
a
question
in
them
as
she
said
,
"
You
look
good
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
is
God
's
command
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
trust
me
.
<EOS>
Let
me
help
you
.
<EOS>
I
will
die
before
I
will
let
any
harm
come
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
rose
from
her
sitting
posture
,
first
dragging
the
saturated
cloak
and
then
letting
it
fall
on
the
ground
 
<EOS>
it
was
too
heavy
for
her
tired
arms
.
<EOS>
Her
little
woman
's
figure
as
she
laid
her
delicate
chilled
hands
together
one
over
the
other
against
her
waist
,
and
went
a
step
backward
while
she
leaned
her
head
forward
as
if
not
to
lose
sight
of
his
face
,
was
unspeakably
touching
.
  
<EOS>
"
Great
God
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
words
escaped
Deronda
in
a
tone
so
low
and
solemn
that
they
seemed
like
a
prayer
become
unconsciously
vocal
.
<EOS>
The
agitating
impression
this
forsaken
girl
was
making
on
him
stirred
a
fibre
that
lay
close
to
his
deepest
interest
in
the
fates
of
women
 
<EOS>
"
perhaps
my
mother
was
like
this
one
.
"
<EOS>
The
old
thought
had
come
now
with
a
new
impetus
of
mingled
feeling
,
and
urged
that
exclamation
in
which
both
East
and
West
have
for
ages
concentrated
their
awe
in
the
presence
of
inexorable
calamity
.
  
<EOS>
The
low
-
toned
words
seemed
to
have
some
reassurance
in
them
for
the
hearer
:
she
stepped
forward
close
to
the
boat
's
side
,
and
Deronda
put
out
his
hand
,
hoping
now
that
she
would
let
him
help
her
in
.
<EOS>
She
had
already
put
her
tiny
hand
into
his
which
closed
around
it
,
when
some
new
thought
struck
her
,
and
drawing
back
<EOS>
she
said
    
"
I
have
nowhere
to
go
 
nobody
belonging
to
me
in
all
this
land
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
take
you
to
a
lady
who
has
daughters
,
"
said
Deronda
,
immediately
.
<EOS>
He
felt
a
sort
of
relief
in
gathering
that
the
wretched
home
and
cruel
friends
he
imagined
her
to
be
fleeing
from
were
not
in
the
near
background
.
<EOS>
Still
she
hesitated
,
and
said
more
timidly
than
ever
    
"
Do
you
belong
to
the
theatre
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
theatre
,
"
said
Deronda
,
in
a
decided
tone
.
<EOS>
Then
beseechingly
,
"
I
will
put
you
in
perfect
safety
at
once
;
with
a
lady
,
a
good
woman
;
I
am
sure
she
will
be
kind
.
<EOS>
Let
us
lose
no
time
:
you
will
make
yourself
ill
.
<EOS>
Life
may
still
become
sweet
to
you
.
<EOS>
There
are
good
people
 
<EOS>
there
are
good
women
who
will
take
care
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
drew
backward
no
more
,
but
stepped
in
easily
,
as
if
she
were
used
to
such
action
,
and
sat
down
on
the
cushions
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
a
covering
for
your
head
,
"
said
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
hat
?
"
<EOS>
(
She
lifted
up
her
hands
to
her
head
.
)
<EOS>
"
It
is
quite
hidden
in
the
bush
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
find
it
,
"
said
Deronda
,
putting
out
his
hand
deprecatingly
as
she
attempted
to
rise
.
<EOS>
"
The
boat
is
fixed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
jumped
out
,
found
the
hat
,
and
lifted
up
the
saturated
cloak
,
wringing
it
and
throwing
it
into
the
bottom
of
the
boat
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
carry
the
cloak
away
,
to
prevent
any
one
who
may
have
noticed
you
from
thinking
you
have
been
drowned
,
"
he
said
,
cheerfully
,
as
he
got
in
again
and
presented
the
old
hat
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
had
any
other
garment
than
my
coat
to
offer
you
.
<EOS>
But
shall
you
mind
throwing
it
over
your
shoulders
while
we
are
on
the
water
?
<EOS>
It
is
quite
an
ordinary
thing
to
do
,
when
people
return
late
and
are
not
enough
provided
with
wraps
.
"
<EOS>
He
held
out
the
coat
toward
her
with
a
smile
,
and
there
came
a
faint
melancholy
smile
in
answer
,
as
she
took
it
and
put
it
on
very
cleverly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
some
biscuits
 
<EOS>
should
you
like
them
?
"
said
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
can
not
eat
.
<EOS>
I
had
still
some
money
left
to
buy
bread
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
began
to
ply
his
oar
without
further
remark
,
and
they
went
along
swiftly
for
many
minutes
without
speaking
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
look
at
him
,
but
was
watching
the
oar
,
leaning
forward
in
an
attitude
of
repose
,
as
if
she
were
beginning
to
feel
the
comfort
of
returning
warmth
and
the
prospect
of
life
instead
of
death
.
<EOS>
The
twilight
was
deepening
;
the
red
flush
was
all
gone
and
the
little
stars
were
giving
their
answer
one
after
another
.
<EOS>
The
moon
was
rising
,
but
was
still
entangled
among
the
trees
and
buildings
.
<EOS>
The
light
was
not
such
that
he
could
distinctly
discern
the
expression
of
her
features
or
her
glance
,
but
they
were
distinctly
before
him
nevertheless
 
features
and
a
glance
which
seemed
to
have
given
a
fuller
meaning
for
him
to
the
human
face
.
<EOS>
Among
his
anxieties
one
was
dominant
:
his
first
impression
about
her
,
that
her
mind
might
be
disordered
,
had
not
been
quite
dissipated
:
the
project
of
suicide
was
unmistakable
,
and
given
a
deeper
color
to
every
other
suspicious
sign
.
<EOS>
He
longed
to
begin
a
conversation
,
but
abstained
,
wishing
to
encourage
the
confidence
that
might
induce
her
to
speak
first
.
<EOS>
At
last
she
did
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
like
to
listen
to
the
oar
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
So
do
I.
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
had
not
come
,
I
should
have
been
dead
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
bear
you
to
speak
of
that
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
never
be
sorry
that
I
came
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
see
how
I
shall
be
glad
to
live
.
<EOS>
The
_
maggior
dolore
_
and
the
_
miseria
_
have
lasted
longer
than
the
_
tempo
felice
_
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
paused
and
then
went
on
dreamily
,
 
"
_
Dolore
 
miseria
_
 
<EOS>
I
think
those
words
are
alive
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
was
mute
:
to
question
her
seemed
an
unwarrantable
freedom
;
he
shrank
from
appearing
to
claim
the
authority
of
a
benefactor
,
or
to
treat
her
with
the
less
reverence
because
she
was
in
distress
.
<EOS>
She
went
on
musingly
    
<EOS>
"
I
thought
it
was
not
wicked
.
<EOS>
Death
and
life
are
one
before
the
Eternal
.
<EOS>
I
know
our
fathers
slew
their
children
and
then
slew
themselves
,
to
keep
their
souls
pure
.
<EOS>
I
meant
it
so
.
<EOS>
But
now
I
am
commanded
to
live
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
see
how
I
shall
live
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
find
friends
.
<EOS>
I
will
find
them
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
shook
her
head
and
said
mournfully
,
"
Not
my
mother
and
brother
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
find
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
English
?
<EOS>
You
must
be
 
speaking
English
so
perfectly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
did
not
answer
immediately
,
but
looked
at
Deronda
again
,
straining
to
see
him
in
the
double
light
.
<EOS>
Until
now
she
had
been
watching
the
oar
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
if
she
were
half
roused
,
and
wondered
which
part
of
her
impression
was
dreaming
and
which
waking
.
<EOS>
Sorrowful
isolation
had
benumbed
her
sense
of
reality
,
and
the
power
of
distinguishing
outward
and
inward
was
continually
slipping
away
from
her
.
<EOS>
Her
look
was
full
of
wondering
timidity
such
as
the
forsaken
one
in
the
desert
might
have
lifted
to
the
angelic
vision
before
she
knew
whether
his
message
was
in
anger
or
in
pity
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
want
to
know
if
I
am
English
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
at
last
,
while
Deronda
was
reddening
nervously
under
a
gaze
which
he
felt
more
fully
than
he
saw
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
know
nothing
except
what
you
like
to
tell
me
,
"
he
said
,
still
uneasy
in
the
fear
that
her
mind
was
wandering
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
it
is
not
good
for
you
to
talk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
will
tell
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
English
-
born
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
a
Jewess
.
<EOS>
"
  
Deronda
was
silent
,
inwardly
wondering
that
he
had
not
said
this
to
himself
before
,
though
any
one
who
had
seen
delicate
-
faced
Spanish
girls
might
simply
have
guessed
her
to
be
Spanish
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
despise
me
for
it
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
presently
in
low
tones
,
which
had
a
sadness
that
pierced
like
a
cry
from
a
small
dumb
creature
in
fear
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
I
?
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
so
foolish
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
many
Jews
are
bad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
are
many
Christians
.
<EOS>
But
I
should
not
think
it
fair
for
you
to
despise
me
because
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
mother
and
brother
were
good
.
<EOS>
But
I
shall
never
find
them
.
<EOS>
I
am
come
a
long
way
 
from
abroad
.
<EOS>
I
ran
away
;
but
I
can
not
tell
you
 
I
can
not
speak
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
thought
I
might
find
my
mother
again
 
God
would
guide
me
.
<EOS>
But
then
I
despaired
.
<EOS>
This
morning
when
the
light
came
,
I
felt
as
if
one
word
kept
sounding
within
me
 
Never
!
<EOS>
never
!
<EOS>
But
now
 
I
begin
 
to
think
 
"
her
words
were
broken
by
rising
sobs
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
commanded
to
live
 
<EOS>
perhaps
we
are
going
to
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
an
outburst
of
weeping
she
buried
her
head
on
her
knees
.
<EOS>
He
hoped
that
this
passionate
weeping
might
relieve
her
excitement
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
he
was
inwardly
picturing
in
much
embarrassment
how
he
should
present
himself
with
her
in
Park
Lane
 
the
course
which
he
had
at
first
unreflectingly
determined
on
.
<EOS>
No
one
kinder
and
more
gentle
than
Lady
Mallinger
;
but
it
was
hardly
probable
that
she
would
be
at
home
;
and
he
had
a
shuddering
sense
of
a
lackey
staring
at
this
delicate
,
sorrowful
image
of
womanhood
 
of
glaring
lights
and
fine
staircases
,
and
perhaps
chilling
suspicious
manners
from
lady
's
maid
and
housekeeper
,
that
might
scare
the
mind
already
in
a
state
of
dangerous
susceptibility
.
<EOS>
But
to
take
her
to
any
other
shelter
than
a
home
already
known
to
him
was
not
to
be
contemplated
:
he
was
full
of
fears
about
the
issue
of
the
adventure
which
had
brought
on
him
a
responsibility
all
the
heavier
for
the
strong
and
agitating
impression
this
childlike
creature
had
made
on
him
.
<EOS>
But
another
resource
came
to
mind
:
he
could
venture
to
take
her
to
Mrs.
Meyrick
's
 
to
the
small
house
at
Chelsea
 
where
he
had
been
often
enough
since
his
return
from
abroad
to
feel
sure
that
he
could
appeal
there
to
generous
hearts
,
which
had
a
romantic
readiness
to
believe
in
innocent
need
and
to
help
it
.
<EOS>
Hans
Meyrick
was
safe
away
in
Italy
,
and
Deronda
felt
the
comfort
of
presenting
himself
with
his
charge
at
a
house
where
he
would
be
met
by
a
motherly
figure
of
quakerish
neatness
,
and
three
girls
who
hardly
knew
of
any
evil
closer
to
them
than
what
lay
in
history
-
books
,
and
dramas
,
and
would
at
once
associate
a
lovely
Jewess
with
Rebecca
in
"
Ivanhoe
,
"
besides
thinking
that
everything
they
did
at
Deronda
's
request
would
be
done
for
their
idol
,
Hans
.
<EOS>
The
vision
of
the
Chelsea
home
once
raised
,
Deronda
no
longer
hesitated
.
  
<EOS>
The
rumbling
thither
in
the
cab
after
the
stillness
of
the
water
seemed
long
.
<EOS>
Happily
his
charge
had
been
quiet
since
her
fit
of
weeping
,
and
submitted
like
a
tired
child
.
<EOS>
When
they
were
in
the
cab
,
she
laid
down
her
hat
and
tried
to
rest
her
head
,
but
the
jolting
movement
would
not
let
it
rest
.
<EOS>
Still
she
dozed
,
and
her
sweet
head
hung
helpless
,
first
on
one
side
,
then
on
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
too
good
to
have
any
fear
about
taking
her
in
,
"
thought
Deronda
.
<EOS>
Her
person
,
her
voice
,
her
exquisite
utterance
,
were
one
strong
appeal
to
belief
and
tenderness
.
<EOS>
Yet
what
had
been
the
history
which
had
brought
her
to
this
desolation
?
<EOS>
He
was
going
on
a
strange
errand
 
to
ask
shelter
for
this
waif
.
<EOS>
Then
there
occurred
to
him
the
beautiful
story
Plutarch
<EOS>
somewhere
tells
of
the
Delphic
women
:
how
when
the
Maenads
,
outworn
with
their
torch
-
lit
wanderings
,
lay
down
to
sleep
in
the
market
-
place
,
the
matrons
came
and
stood
silently
round
them
to
keep
guard
over
their
slumbers
;
then
,
when
they
waked
,
ministered
to
them
tenderly
and
saw
them
safely
to
their
own
borders
.
<EOS>
He
could
trust
the
women
he
was
going
to
for
having
hearts
as
good
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
felt
himself
growing
older
this
evening
and
entering
on
a
new
phase
in
finding
a
life
to
which
his
own
had
come
 
perhaps
as
a
rescue
;
but
how
to
make
sure
that
snatching
from
death
was
rescue
?
<EOS>
The
moment
of
finding
a
fellow
-
creature
is
often
as
full
of
mingled
doubt
and
exultation
as
the
moment
of
finding
an
idea
.
      
<EOS>
Life
is
a
various
mother
:
now
she
dons
  
Her
plumes
and
brilliants
,
climbs
the
marble
stairs
  
<EOS>
With
head
aloft
,
nor
ever
turns
her
eyes
  
On
lackeys
who
attend
her
;
now
she
dwells
  
Grim
-
clad
,
up
darksome
allyes
,
breathes
hot
gin
,
  
And
screams
in
pauper
riot
.
                               
<EOS>
But
to
these
  
She
came
a
frugal
matron
,
neat
and
deft
,
  
With
cheerful
morning
thoughts
and
quick
device
  
To
find
the
much
in
little
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs.
Meyrick
's
house
was
not
noisy
:
the
front
parlor
looked
on
the
river
,
and
the
back
on
gardens
,
so
that
though
she
was
reading
aloud
to
her
daughters
,
the
window
could
be
left
open
to
freshen
the
air
of
the
small
double
room
where
a
lamp
and
two
candles
were
burning
.
<EOS>
The
candles
were
on
a
table
apart
for
Kate
,
who
was
drawing
illustrations
for
a
publisher
;
the
lamp
was
not
only
for
the
reader
but
for
Amy
and
Mab
,
who
were
embroidering
satin
cushions
for
"
the
great
world
.
"
  
<EOS>
Outside
,
the
house
looked
very
narrow
and
shabby
,
the
bright
light
through
the
holland
blind
showing
the
heavy
old
-
fashioned
window
-
frame
;
but
it
is
pleasant
to
know
that
many
such
grim
-
walled
slices
of
space
in
our
foggy
London
have
been
and
still
are
the
homes
of
a
culture
the
more
spotlessly
free
from
vulgarity
,
because
poverty
has
rendered
everything
like
display
an
impersonal
question
,
and
all
the
grand
shows
of
the
world
simply
a
spectacle
which
rouses
petty
rivalry
or
vain
effort
after
possession
.
  
<EOS>
The
Meyricks
'
was
a
home
of
that
kind
:
and
they
all
clung
to
this
particular
house
in
a
row
because
its
interior
was
filled
with
objects
always
in
the
same
places
,
which
,
for
the
mother
held
memories
of
her
marriage
time
,
and
for
the
young
ones
<EOS>
seemed
as
necessary
and
uncriticised
a
part
of
their
world
as
the
stars
of
the
Great
Bear
seen
from
the
back
windows
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Meyrick
had
borne
much
stint
of
other
matters
that
she
might
be
able
to
keep
some
engravings
specially
cherished
by
her
husband
;
and
the
narrow
spaces
of
wall
held
a
world
history
in
scenes
and
heads
which
the
children
had
early
learned
by
heart
.
<EOS>
The
chairs
and
tables
were
also
old
friends
preferred
to
new
.
<EOS>
But
in
these
two
little
parlors
with
no
furniture
that
a
broker
would
have
cared
to
cheapen
except
the
prints
and
piano
,
there
was
space
and
apparatus
for
a
wide
-
glancing
,
nicely
-
select
life
,
opened
to
the
highest
things
in
music
,
painting
and
poetry
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
sure
that
in
the
times
of
greatest
scarcity
,
before
Kate
could
get
paid
-
work
,
these
ladies
had
always
had
a
servant
to
light
their
fires
and
sweep
their
rooms
;
yet
they
were
fastidious
in
some
points
,
and
could
not
believe
that
the
manners
of
ladies
in
the
fashionable
world
were
so
full
of
coarse
selfishness
,
petty
quarreling
,
and
slang
as
they
are
represented
to
be
in
what
are
called
literary
photographs
.
<EOS>
The
Meyricks
had
their
little
oddities
,
streaks
of
eccentricity
from
the
mother
's
blood
as
well
as
the
father
's
,
their
minds
being
like
mediæval
houses
with
unexpected
recesses
and
openings
from
this
into
that
,
flights
of
steps
and
sudden
outlooks
.
  
<EOS>
But
mother
and
daughters
were
all
united
by
a
triple
bond
 
family
love
;
admiration
for
the
finest
work
,
the
best
action
;
and
habitual
industry
.
<EOS>
Hans
'
desire
to
spend
some
of
his
money
in
making
their
lives
more
luxurious
had
been
resisted
by
all
of
them
,
and
both
they
and
he
had
been
thus
saved
from
regrets
at
the
threatened
triumphs
of
his
yearning
for
art
over
the
attractions
of
secured
income
 
a
triumph
that
would
by
-
and
-
by
oblige
him
to
give
up
his
fellowship
.
<EOS>
They
could
all
afford
to
laugh
at
his
Gavarni
-
caricatures
and
to
hold
him
blameless
in
following
a
natural
bent
which
their
unselfishness
and
independence
had
left
without
obstacle
.
<EOS>
It
was
enough
for
them
to
go
on
in
their
old
way
,
only
having
a
grand
treat
of
opera
-
going
(
to
the
gallery
)
when
Hans
came
home
on
a
visit
.
  
<EOS>
Seeing
the
group
they
made
this
evening
,
one
could
hardly
wish
them
to
change
their
way
of
life
.
<EOS>
They
were
all
alike
small
,
and
so
in
due
proportion
to
their
miniature
rooms
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Meyrick
was
reading
aloud
from
a
French
book
;
she
was
a
lively
little
woman
,
half
French
,
half
Scotch
,
with
a
pretty
articulateness
of
speech
that
seemed
to
make
daylight
in
her
hearer
's
understanding
.
<EOS>
Though
she
was
not
yet
fifty
,
her
rippling
hair
,
covered
by
a
quakerish
net
cap
,
was
chiefly
gray
,
but
her
eyebrows
were
brown
as
the
bright
eyes
below
them
;
her
black
dress
,
almost
like
a
priest
's
cassock
with
its
rows
of
buttons
,
suited
a
neat
figure
hardly
five
feet
high
.
<EOS>
The
daughters
were
to
match
the
mother
,
except
that
Mab
had
Hans
'
light
hair
and
complexion
,
with
a
bossy
,
irregular
brow
,
and
other
quaintnesses
that
reminded
one
of
him
.
<EOS>
Everything
about
them
was
compact
,
from
the
firm
coils
of
their
hair
,
fastened
back
_
à
<EOS>
la
Chinoise
_
,
to
their
gray
skirts
in
Puritan
nonconformity
with
the
fashion
,
which
at
that
time
would
have
demanded
that
four
feminine
circumferences
should
fill
all
the
free
space
in
the
front
parlor
.
<EOS>
All
four
,
if
they
had
been
wax
-
work
,
might
have
been
packed
easily
in
a
fashionable
lady
's
traveling
trunk
.
<EOS>
Their
faces
seemed
full
of
speech
,
as
if
their
minds
had
been
shelled
,
after
the
manner
of
horse
-
chestnuts
,
and
become
brightly
visible
.
<EOS>
The
only
large
thing
of
its
kind
in
the
room
was
Hafiz
,
the
Persian
cat
,
comfortably
poised
on
the
brown
leather
back
of
a
chair
,
and
opening
his
large
eyes
now
and
then
to
see
that
the
lower
animals
were
not
in
any
mischief
.
  
<EOS>
The
book
Mrs.
Meyrick
had
before
her
was
Erckmann
-
Chatrian
's
<EOS>
_
Historie
d'un
<EOS>
Conscrit
_
.
<EOS>
She
had
just
finished
reading
it
aloud
,
and
Mab
,
who
had
let
her
work
fall
on
the
ground
while
she
stretched
her
head
forward
and
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
reader
,
exclaimed
    
<EOS>
"
I
think
that
is
the
finest
story
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
Mab
!
"
said
Amy
,
"
it
is
the
last
you
have
heard
.
<EOS>
Everything
that
pleases
you
is
the
best
in
its
turn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
hardly
to
be
called
a
story
,
"
said
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
bit
of
history
brought
near
us
with
a
strong
telescope
.
<EOS>
We
can
see
the
soldiers
'
faces
:
no
,
it
is
more
than
that
 
we
can
hear
everything
 
<EOS>
we
can
almost
hear
their
hearts
beat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
what
you
call
it
,
"
said
Mab
,
flirting
away
her
thimble
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Call
it
a
chapter
in
Revelations
.
<EOS>
It
makes
me
want
to
do
something
good
,
something
grand
.
<EOS>
It
makes
me
so
sorry
for
everybody
.
<EOS>
It
makes
me
like
Schiller
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
take
the
world
in
my
arms
and
kiss
it
.
<EOS>
I
must
kiss
you
instead
,
little
mother
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
threw
her
arms
round
her
mother
's
neck
.
  
<EOS>
"
Whenever
you
are
in
that
mood
,
Mab
,
down
goes
your
work
,
"
said
Amy
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
doing
something
good
to
finish
your
cushion
without
soiling
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
 
<EOS>
oh
 
oh
!
"
groaned
Mab
,
as
she
stooped
to
pick
up
her
work
and
thimble
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
had
three
wounded
conscripts
to
take
care
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
spill
their
beef
-
tea
while
you
were
talking
,
"
said
Amy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Mab
!
<EOS>
do
n't
be
hard
on
her
,
"
said
the
mother
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Give
me
the
embroidery
now
,
child
.
<EOS>
You
go
on
with
your
enthusiasm
,
and
I
will
go
on
with
the
pink
and
white
poppy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
ma
,
I
think
you
are
more
caustic
than
Amy
,
"
said
Kate
,
while
she
drew
her
head
back
to
look
at
her
drawing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
 
<EOS>
oh
 
oh
!
"
cried
Mab
again
,
rising
and
stretching
her
arms
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
something
wonderful
would
happen
.
<EOS>
I
feel
like
the
deluge
.
<EOS>
The
waters
of
the
great
deep
are
broken
up
,
and
the
windows
of
heaven
are
opened
.
<EOS>
I
must
sit
down
and
play
the
scales
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mab
was
opening
the
piano
while
the
others
were
laughing
at
this
climax
,
when
a
cab
stopped
before
the
house
,
and
there
forthwith
came
a
quick
rap
of
the
knocker
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
starting
up
,
"
it
is
after
ten
,
and
Phoebe
is
gone
to
bed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
hastened
out
,
leaving
the
parlor
door
open
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Deronda
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
girls
could
hear
this
exclamation
from
their
mamma
.
<EOS>
Mab
clasped
her
hands
,
saying
in
a
loud
whisper
,
"
There
now
!
<EOS>
something
_
<EOS>
is
_
going
to
happen
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Kate
and
Amy
gave
up
their
work
in
amazement
.
<EOS>
But
Deronda
's
tone
in
reply
was
so
low
that
they
could
not
hear
his
words
,
and
Mrs.
Meyrick
immediately
closed
the
parlor
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
I
am
trusting
to
your
goodness
in
a
most
extraordinary
way
,
"
Deronda
went
on
,
after
giving
his
brief
narrative
;
"
but
you
can
imagine
how
helpless
I
feel
with
a
young
creature
like
this
on
my
hands
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
go
with
her
among
strangers
,
and
in
her
nervous
state
I
should
dread
taking
her
into
a
house
full
of
servants
.
<EOS>
I
have
trusted
to
your
mercy
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
not
think
my
act
unwarrantable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
You
have
honored
me
by
trusting
me
.
<EOS>
I
see
your
difficulty
.
<EOS>
Pray
bring
her
in
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
and
prepare
the
girls
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
While
Deronda
went
back
to
the
cab
,
Mrs.
Meyrick
turned
into
the
parlor
again
and
said
:
"
Here
is
somebody
to
take
care
of
instead
of
your
wounded
conscripts
,
Mab
:
a
poor
girl
who
was
going
to
drown
herself
in
despair
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Deronda
found
her
only
just
in
time
to
save
her
.
<EOS>
He
brought
her
along
in
his
boat
,
and
did
not
know
what
else
it
would
be
safe
to
do
with
her
,
so
he
has
trusted
us
and
brought
her
here
.
<EOS>
It
seems
she
is
a
Jewess
,
but
quite
refined
,
he
says
 
knowing
Italian
and
music
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
three
girls
,
wondering
and
expectant
,
came
forward
and
stood
near
each
other
in
mute
confidence
that
they
were
all
feeling
alike
under
this
appeal
to
their
compassion
.
<EOS>
Mab
looked
rather
awe
-
stricken
,
as
if
this
answer
to
her
wish
were
something
preternatural
.
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
Deronda
going
to
the
door
of
the
cab
where
the
pale
face
was
now
gazing
out
with
roused
observation
,
said
,
"
I
have
brought
you
to
some
of
the
kindest
people
in
the
world
:
<EOS>
there
are
daughters
like
you
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
happy
home
.
<EOS>
Will
you
let
me
take
you
to
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
stepped
out
obediently
,
putting
her
hand
in
his
and
forgetting
her
hat
;
and
when
Deronda
led
her
into
the
full
light
of
the
parlor
where
the
four
little
women
stood
awaiting
her
,
she
made
a
picture
that
would
have
stirred
much
duller
sensibilities
than
theirs
.
<EOS>
At
first
she
was
a
little
dazed
by
the
sudden
light
,
and
before
she
had
concentrated
her
glance
<EOS>
he
had
put
her
hand
into
the
mother
's
.
<EOS>
He
was
inwardly
rejoicing
that
the
Meyricks
were
so
small
:
the
dark
-
curled
head
was
the
highest
among
them
.
<EOS>
The
poor
wanderer
could
not
be
afraid
of
these
gentle
faces
so
near
hers
:
<EOS>
and
now
she
was
looking
at
each
of
them
in
turn
while
the
mother
said
,
"
You
must
be
weary
,
poor
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
take
care
of
you
 
<EOS>
we
will
comfort
you
 
we
will
love
you
,
"
cried
Mab
,
no
longer
able
to
restrain
herself
,
and
taking
the
small
right
hand
caressingly
between
both
her
own
.
<EOS>
This
gentle
welcoming
warmth
was
penetrating
the
bewildered
one
:
she
hung
back
just
enough
to
see
better
the
four
faces
in
front
of
her
,
whose
good
will
was
being
reflected
in
hers
,
not
in
any
smile
,
but
in
that
undefinable
change
which
tells
us
that
anxiety
is
passing
in
contentment
.
<EOS>
For
an
instant
she
looked
up
at
Deronda
,
as
if
she
were
referring
all
this
mercy
to
him
,
and
then
again
turning
to
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
said
with
more
collectedness
in
her
sweet
tones
than
he
had
heard
before
    
"
I
am
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
I
am
a
Jewess
.
<EOS>
You
might
have
thought
I
was
wicked
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
we
are
sure
you
are
good
,
"
burst
out
Mab
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
think
no
evil
of
you
,
poor
child
.
<EOS>
You
shall
be
safe
with
us
,
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
.
<EOS>
"
Come
now
and
sit
down
.
<EOS>
You
must
have
some
food
,
and
then
you
must
go
to
rest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
stranger
looked
up
again
at
Deronda
,
who
said
    
"
You
will
have
no
more
fears
with
these
friends
?
<EOS>
You
will
rest
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
should
not
fear
.
<EOS>
I
should
rest
.
<EOS>
I
think
these
are
the
ministering
angels
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Meyrick
wanted
to
lead
her
to
seat
,
but
again
hanging
back
gently
,
the
poor
weary
thing
spoke
as
if
with
a
scruple
at
being
received
without
a
further
account
of
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
name
is
Mirah
Lapidoth
.
<EOS>
I
am
come
a
long
way
,
all
the
way
from
Prague
by
myself
.
<EOS>
I
made
my
escape
.
<EOS>
I
ran
away
from
dreadful
things
.
<EOS>
I
came
to
find
my
mother
and
brother
in
London
.
<EOS>
I
had
been
taken
from
my
mother
when
I
was
little
,
but
I
thought
I
could
find
her
again
.
<EOS>
I
had
trouble
 
<EOS>
the
houses
were
all
gone
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
find
her
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
a
long
while
,
and
I
had
not
much
money
.
<EOS>
That
is
why
I
am
in
distress
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Our
mother
will
be
good
to
you
,
"
cried
Mab
.
<EOS>
"
See
what
a
nice
little
mother
she
is
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
sit
down
now
,
"
said
Kate
,
moving
a
chair
forward
,
while
Amy
ran
to
get
some
tea
.
  
<EOS>
Mirah
resisted
no
longer
,
but
seated
herself
with
perfect
grace
,
crossing
her
little
feet
,
laying
her
hands
one
over
the
other
on
her
lap
,
and
looking
at
her
friends
with
placid
reverence
;
whereupon
Hafiz
,
who
had
been
watching
the
scene
restlessly
came
forward
with
tail
erect
and
rubbed
himself
against
her
ankles
.
<EOS>
Deronda
felt
it
time
to
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
allow
me
to
come
again
and
inquire
 
perhaps
at
five
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
"
he
said
to
Mrs.
Meyrick
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
pray
;
we
shall
have
had
time
to
make
acquaintance
then
.

<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
"
said
Deronda
,
looking
down
at
Mirah
,
and
putting
out
his
hand
.
<EOS>
She
rose
as
she
took
it
,
and
the
moment
brought
back
to
them
both
strongly
the
other
moment
when
she
had
first
taken
that
outstretched
hand
.
<EOS>
She
lifted
her
eyes
to
his
and
said
with
reverential
fervor
,
"
The
God
of
our
fathers
bless
you
and
deliver
you
from
all
evil
as
you
have
delivered
me
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
believe
there
was
any
man
so
good
.
<EOS>
None
before
have
thought
me
worthy
of
the
best
.
<EOS>
You
found
me
poor
and
miserable
,
yet
you
have
given
me
the
best
.
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
could
not
speak
,
but
with
silent
adieux
to
the
Meyricks
,
hurried
away

<EOS>
To
say
that
Deronda
was
romantic
would
be
to
misrepresent
him
;
but
under
his
calm
and
somewhat
self
-
repressed
exterior
there
was
a
fervor
which
made
him
easily
find
poetry
and
romance
among
the
events
of
every
-
day
life
.
<EOS>
And
perhaps
poetry
and
romance
are
as
plentiful
as
ever
in
the
world
except
for
those
phlegmatic
natures
who
I
suspect
<EOS>
would
in
any
age
have
regarded
them
as
a
dull
form
of
erroneous
thinking
.
<EOS>
They
exist
very
easily
in
the
same
room
with
the
microscope
and
even
in
railway
carriages
:
what
banishes
them
in
the
vacuum
in
gentlemen
and
lady
passengers
.
<EOS>
How
should
all
the
apparatus
of
heaven
and
earth
,
from
the
farthest
firmament
to
the
tender
bosom
of
the
mother
who
nourished
us
,
make
poetry
for
a
mind
that
had
no
movements
of
awe
and
tenderness
,
no
sense
of
fellowship
which
thrills
from
the
near
to
the
distant
,
and
back
again
from
the
distant
to
the
near
?
  
<EOS>
To
Deronda
this
event
of
finding
Mirah
was
as
heart
-
stirring
as
anything
that
befell
Orestes
or
Rinaldo
.
<EOS>
He
sat
up
half
the
night
,
living
again
through
the
moments
since
he
had
first
discerned
Mirah
on
the
river
-
brink
,
with
the
fresh
and
fresh
vividness
which
belongs
to
emotive
memory
.
<EOS>
When
he
took
up
a
book
to
try
and
dull
this
urgency
of
inward
vision
,
the
printed
words
were
no
more
than
a
network
through
which
he
saw
and
heard
everything
as
clearly
as
before
 
saw
not
only
the
actual
events
of
two
hours
,
but
possibilities
of
what
had
been
and
what
might
be
which
those
events
were
enough
to
feed
with
the
warm
blood
of
passionate
hope
and
fear
.
<EOS>
Something
in
his
own
experience
caused
Mirah
's
search
after
her
mother
to
lay
hold
with
peculiar
force
on
his
imagination
.
<EOS>
The
first
prompting
of
sympathy
was
to
aid
her
in
her
search
:
if
given
persons
were
extant
in
London
there
were
ways
of
finding
them
,
as
subtle
as
scientific
experiment
,
the
right
machinery
being
set
at
work
.
<EOS>
But
here
the
mixed
feelings
which
belonged
to
Deronda
's
kindred
experience
naturally
transfused
themselves
into
his
anxiety
on
behalf
of
Mirah
.
  
<EOS>
The
desire
to
know
his
own
mother
,
or
to
know
about
her
,
was
constantly
haunted
with
dread
;
and
in
imagining
what
might
befall
Mirah
it
quickly
occurred
to
him
that
finding
the
mother
and
brother
from
whom
she
had
been
parted
when
she
was
a
little
one
might
turn
out
to
be
a
calamity
.
<EOS>
When
she
was
in
the
boat
she
said
that
her
mother
and
brother
were
good
;
but
the
goodness
might
have
been
chiefly
in
her
own
ignorant
innocence
and
yearning
memory
,
and
the
ten
or
twelve
years
since
the
parting
had
been
time
enough
for
much
worsening
.
<EOS>
Spite
of
his
strong
tendency
to
side
with
the
objects
of
prejudice
,
and
in
general
with
those
who
got
the
worst
of
it
,
his
interest
had
never
been
practically
drawn
toward
existing
Jews
,
and
the
facts
he
knew
about
them
,
whether
they
walked
conspicuous
in
fine
apparel
or
lurked
in
by
-
streets
,
were
chiefly
of
a
sort
most
repugnant
to
him
.
<EOS>
Of
learned
and
accomplished
Jews
<EOS>
he
took
it
for
granted
that
they
had
dropped
their
religion
,
and
wished
to
be
merged
in
the
people
of
their
native
lands
.
<EOS>
Scorn
flung
at
a
Jew
as
such
would
have
roused
all
his
sympathy
in
griefs
of
inheritance
;
but
<EOS>
the
indiscriminate
scorn
of
a
race
will
often
strike
a
specimen
who
has
well
earned
it
on
his
own
account
,
and
might
fairly
be
gibbeted
as
a
rascally
son
of
Adam
.
<EOS>
It
appears
that
the
Caribs
,
who
know
little
of
theology
,
regard
thieving
as
a
practice
peculiarly
connected
with
Christian
tenets
,
and
probably
they
could
allege
experimental
grounds
for
this
opinion
.
<EOS>
Deronda
could
not
escape
(
who
can
?
)
<EOS>
knowing
ugly
stories
of
Jewish
characteristics
and
occupations
;
and
though
one
of
his
favorite
protests
was
against
the
severance
of
past
and
present
history
,
he
was
like
others
who
shared
his
protest
,
in
never
having
cared
to
reach
any
more
special
conclusions
about
actual
Jews
than
that
they
retained
the
virtues
and
vices
of
a
long
-
oppressed
race
.
<EOS>
But
now
that
Mirah
's
longing
roused
his
mind
to
a
closer
survey
of
details
,
very
disagreeable
images
urged
themselves
of
what
it
might
be
to
find
out
this
middle
-
aged
Jewess
and
her
son
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
there
was
the
exquisite
refinement
and
charm
of
the
creature
herself
to
make
a
presumption
in
favor
of
her
immediate
kindred
,
but
 
he
must
wait
to
know
more
:
perhaps
through
Mrs.
Meyrick
he
might
gather
some
guiding
hints
from
Mirah
's
own
lips
.
<EOS>
Her
voice
,
her
accent
,
her
looks
 
all
the
sweet
purity
that
clothed
her
as
with
a
consecrating
garment
made
him
shrink
the
more
from
giving
her
,
either
ideally
or
practically
,
an
association
with
what
was
hateful
or
contaminating
.
<EOS>
But
these
fine
words
with
which
we
fumigate
and
becloud
unpleasant
facts
are
not
the
language
in
which
we
think
.
<EOS>
Deronda
's
thinking
went
on
in
rapid
images
of
what
might
be
:
he
saw
himself
guided
by
some
official
scout
into
a
dingy
street
;
he
entered
through
a
dim
doorway
,
and
saw
a
hawk
-
eyed
woman
,
rough
-
headed
,
and
unwashed
,
cheapening
a
hungry
girl
's
last
bit
of
finery
;
or
in
some
quarter
only
the
more
hideous
for
being
smarter
,
he
found
himself
under
the
breath
of
a
young
Jew
talkative
and
familiar
,
willing
to
show
his
acquaintance
with
gentlemen
's
tastes
,
and
not
fastidious
in
any
transactions
with
which
they
would
favor
him
 
and
so
on
through
the
brief
chapter
of
his
experience
in
this
kind
.
<EOS>
Excuse
him
:
<EOS>
his
mind
was
not
apt
to
run
spontaneously
into
insulting
ideas
,
or
to
practice
a
form
of
wit
which
identifies
Moses
with
the
advertisement
sheet
;
but
he
was
just
now
governed
by
dread
,
and
if
Mirah
's
parents
had
been
Christian
,
the
chief
difference
would
have
been
that
his
forebodings
would
have
been
fed
with
wider
knowledge
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
habit
of
his
mind
to
connect
dread
with
unknown
parentage
,
and
in
this
case
as
well
as
his
own
there
was
enough
to
make
the
connection
reasonable
.
  
<EOS>
But
what
was
to
be
done
with
Mirah
?
<EOS>
She
needed
shelter
and
protection
in
the
fullest
sense
,
and
all
his
chivalrous
sentiment
roused
itself
to
insist
that
the
sooner
and
the
more
fully
he
could
engage
for
her
the
interest
of
others
besides
himself
,
the
better
he
should
fulfill
her
claims
on
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
right
to
provide
for
her
entirely
,
though
he
might
be
able
to
do
so
;
the
very
depth
of
the
impression
she
had
produced
made
him
desire
that
she
should
understand
herself
to
be
entirely
independent
of
him
;
and
vague
visions
of
the
future
which
he
tried
to
dispel
as
fantastic
left
their
influence
in
an
anxiety
stronger
than
any
motive
he
could
give
for
it
,
that
those
who
saw
his
actions
closely
should
be
acquainted
from
the
first
with
the
history
of
his
relation
to
Mirah
.
<EOS>
He
had
learned
to
hate
secrecy
about
the
grand
ties
and
obligations
of
his
life
 
to
hate
it
the
more
because
a
strong
spell
of
interwoven
sensibilities
hindered
him
from
breaking
such
secrecy
.
<EOS>
Deronda
had
made
a
vow
to
himself
that
 
since
the
truths
which
disgrace
mortals
are
not
all
of
their
own
making
 
<EOS>
the
truth
should
never
be
made
a
disgrace
to
another
by
his
act
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
without
terror
lest
he
should
break
this
vow
,
and
fall
into
the
apologetic
philosophy
which
explains
the
world
into
containing
nothing
better
than
one
's
own
conduct
.
  
<EOS>
At
one
moment
he
resolved
to
tell
the
whole
of
his
adventure
to
Sir
Hugo
and
Lady
Mallinger
the
next
morning
at
breakfast
,
but
the
possibility
that
something
quite
new
might
reveal
itself
on
his
next
visit
to
Mrs.
Meyrick
's
checked
this
impulse
,
and
he
finally
went
to
sleep
on
the
conclusion
that
he
would
wait
until
that
visit
had
been
made
.
        
<EOS>
"
It
will
hardly
be
denied
that
even
in
this
frail
and
corrupted
world
,
    
we
sometimes
meet
persons
who
,
in
their
very
mien
and
aspect
,
as
well
    
as
in
the
whole
habit
of
life
,
manifest
such
a
signature
and
stamp
of
    
virtue
,
as
to
make
our
judgment
of
them
a
matter
of
intuition
rather
    
than
the
result
of
continued
 
examination
.

ALEXANDER
KNOX
:
quoted
in
    
Southey
's
Life
of
Wesley
.
   
<EOS>
Mirah
said
that
she
had
slept
well
that
night
;
and
when
she
came
down
in
Mab
's
black
dress
,
her
dark
hair
curling
in
fresh
fibrils
as
it
gradually
dried
from
its
plenteous
bath
,
she
looked
like
one
who
was
beginning
to
take
comfort
after
the
long
sorrow
and
watching
which
had
paled
her
cheek
and
made
blue
semicircles
under
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
It
was
Mab
who
carried
her
breakfast
and
ushered
her
down
 
with
some
pride
in
the
effect
produced
by
a
pair
of
tiny
felt
slippers
which
she
had
rushed
out
to
buy
because
there
were
no
shoes
in
the
house
small
enough
for
Mirah
,
whose
borrowed
dress
ceased
about
her
ankles
and
displayed
the
cheap
clothing
that
,
moulding
itself
on
her
feet
,
seemed
an
adornment
as
choice
as
the
sheaths
of
buds
.
<EOS>
The
farthing
buckles
were
bijoux
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
if
you
please
,
mamma
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Mab
,
clasping
her
hands
and
stooping
toward
Mirah
's
feet
,
as
she
entered
the
parlor
<EOS>
;
"
look
at
the
slippers
,
how
beautiful
they
fit
!
<EOS>
I
declare
she
is
like
the
Queen
Budoor
 
"
two
delicate
feet
,
the
work
of
the
protecting
and
all
-
recompensing
Creator
,
support
her
;
and
I
wonder
how
they
can
sustain
what
is
above
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mirah
looked
down
at
her
own
feet
in
a
childlike
way
and
then
smiled
at
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
who
was
saying
inwardly
,
"
One
could
hardly
imagine
this
creature
having
an
evil
thought
.
<EOS>
But
wise
people
would
tell
me
to
be
cautious
.
"
<EOS>
She
returned
Mirah
's
smile
and
said
,
"
I
fear
the
feet
have
had
to
sustain
their
burden
a
little
too
often
lately

<EOS>
But
to
-
day
she
will
rest
and
be

companion

"
And
she
will
tell
you
so
many
things

and
I
shall
not
hear
them

grumbled
Mab
,
who
felt
herself
in
the
first
volume
of
a
delightful
romance
and
obliged
to
miss
some
chapters
because
she
had
to
go
to
pupils

<EOS>
Kate
was
already
gone
to
make
sketches
along
the
river
,
and
Amy
was
away
on
business
errands
.
<EOS>
It
was
what
the
mother
wished
,
to
be
alone
with
this
stranger
,
whose
story
must
be
a
sorrowful
one
,
yet
was
needful
to
be
told

The
small
front
parlor
was
as
good
as
a
temple
that
morning
.
<EOS>
The
sunlight
was
on
the
river
and
soft
air
came
in
through
the
open
window
;
the
walls
showed
a
glorious
silent
cloud
of
witnesses
 
the
Virgin
soaring
amid
her
cherubic
escort
;
grand
Melancholia
with
her
solemn
universe
;
the
Prophets
and
Sibyls
;
the
School
of
Athens
;
the
Last

;
mystic
groups
where
far
-
off
ages
made

;
grave
Holbein

Rembrandt
heads
;
the
Tragic
Muse
;
last

century
children
at
their
musings
or
their
play
;
Italian
poets
 
all
were
there
through
the
medium
of
a
little
black
and
white
.
<EOS>
The
neat
mother
who
had
weathered
her
troubles
,
and
come
out
of
them
with
a
face
still
cheerful
,
was
sorting
colored
wools
for
her
embroidery
.
<EOS>
Hafiz
purred
on
the
window
-
ledge
,
the
clock
on
the
mantle
-
piece
ticked
without
hurry
,
and
the
occasional
sound
of
wheels
seemed
to
lie
outside
the
more
massive
central
quiet
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Meyrick
thought
that
this
quiet
might
be
the
best
invitation
to
speech
on
the
part
of
her
companion
,
and
chose
not
to
disturb
it
by
remark
.
<EOS>
Mirah
sat
opposite
in
her
former
attitude
,
her
hands
clasped
on
her
lap
,
her
ankles
crossed
,
her
eyes
at
first
traveling
slowly
over
the
objects
around
her
,
but
finally
resting
with
a
sort
of
placid
reverence
on
Mrs.
Meyrick
.
<EOS>
At
length
she
began
to
speak
softly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
my
mother
's
face
better
than
anything
;
yet
I
was
not
seven
when
I
was
taken
away
,
and
I
am
nineteen
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
understand
that
,
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
.
<EOS>
"
There
are
some
earliest
things
that
last
the
longest
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
it
was
the
earliest
.
<EOS>
I
think
my
life
began
with
waking
up
and
loving
my
mother
's
face
:
it
was
so
near
to
me
,
and
her
arms
were
round
me
,
and
she
sang
to
me
.
<EOS>
One
hymn
she
sang
so
often
,
so
often
:
<EOS>
and
then
she
taught
me
to
sing
it
with
her
<EOS>
:
it
was
the
first
I
ever
sang
.
<EOS>
They
were
always
Hebrew
hymns
she
sang
;
and
because
I
never
knew
the
meaning
of
the
words
they
seemed
full
of
nothing
but
our
love
and
happiness
.
<EOS>
When
I
lay
in
my
little
bed
<EOS>
and
it
was
all
white
above
me
,
she
used
to
bend
over
me
,
between
me
and
the
white
,
and
sing
in
a
sweet
,
low
voice
.
<EOS>
I
can
dream
myself
back
into
that
time
when
I
am
awake
,
and
it
often
comes
back
to
me
in
my
sleep
 
<EOS>
my
hand
is
very
little
,
I
put
it
up
to
her
face
<EOS>
and
she
kisses
it
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
in
my
dreams
I
begin
to
tremble
and
think
that
we
are
both
dead
;
but
then
I
wake
up
and
my
hand
lies
like
this
,
and
for
a
moment
I
hardly
know
myself
.
<EOS>
But
if
I
could
see
my
mother
again
I
should
know
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
expect
some
change
after
twelve
years
,
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
gently
.
<EOS>
"
See
my
grey
hair
:
ten
years
ago
it
was
bright
brown
.
<EOS>
The
days
and
months
pace
over
us
like
restless
little
birds
,
and
leave
the
marks
of
their
feet
backward
and
forward
;
especially
when
they
are
like
birds
with
heavy
hearts
-
then
they
tread
heavily
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
I
am
sure
her
heart
has
been
heavy
for
want
of
me
.
<EOS>
But
to
feel
her
joy
if
we
could
meet
again
,
and
I
could
make
her
know
I
love
her
and
give
her
deep
comfort
after
all
her
mourning
!
<EOS>
If
that
could
be
,
I
should
mind
nothing
;
I
should
be
glad
that
I
have
lived
through
my
trouble
.
<EOS>
I
did
despair
.
<EOS>
The
world
seemed
miserable
and
wicked
;
none
helped
me
so
that
I
could
bear
their
looks
and
words
;
I
felt
that
my
mother
was
dead
,
and
death
was
the
only
way
to
her
.
<EOS>
But
then
in
the
last
moment
 
yesterday
,
when
I
longed
for
the
water
to
close
over
me
 
<EOS>
and
I
thought
that
death
was
the
best
image
of
mercy
 
<EOS>
then
goodness
came
to
me
living
,
and
I
felt
trust
in
the
living
.
<EOS>
And
 
it
is
strange
 
<EOS>
but
I
began
to
hope
that
she
was
living
too
.
<EOS>
And
now
I
with
you
 
here
 
this
morning
,
peace
and
hope
have
come
into
me
like
a
flood
.
<EOS>
I
want
nothing
;
I
can
wait
;
because
I
hope
and
believe
and
am
grateful
 
<EOS>
oh
,
so
grateful
!
<EOS>
You
have
not
thought
evil
of
me
 
<EOS>
you
have
not
despised
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mirah
spoke
with
low
-
toned
fervor
,
and
sat
as
still
as
a
picture
all
the
while
.
  
<EOS>
"
Many
others
would
have
felt
as
we
do
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
feeling
a
mist
come
over
her
eyes
as
she
looked
at
her
work
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
did
not
meet
them
 
<EOS>
they
did
not
come
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
was
it
that
you
were
taken
from
your
mother
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
I
am
a
long
while
coming
to
that
.
<EOS>
It
is
dreadful
to
speak
of
,
yet
I
must
tell
you
 
I
must
tell
you
everything
.
<EOS>
My
father
 
<EOS>
it
was
he
that
took
me
away
.
<EOS>
I
thought
we
were
only
going
on
a
little
journey
;
and
I
was
pleased
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
box
with
all
my
little
things
in
.
<EOS>
But
we
went
on
board
a
ship
,
and
got
farther
and
farther
away
from
the
land
.
<EOS>
Then
I
was
ill
;
and
I
thought
it
would
never
end
 
<EOS>
it
was
the
first
misery
,
and
it
seemed
endless
.
<EOS>
But
at
last
we
landed
.
<EOS>
I
knew
nothing
then
,
and
believed
what
my
father
said
.
<EOS>
He
comforted
me
,
and
told
me
I
should
go
back
to
my
mother
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
America
we
had
reached
,
and
it
was
long
years
before
we
came
back
to
Europe
.
<EOS>
At
first
I
often
asked
my
father
when
we
were
going
back
;
and
I
tried
to
learn
writing
fast
,
because
I
wanted
to
write
to
my
mother
;
but
one
day
when
he
found
me
trying
to
write
a
letter
,
he
took
me
on
his
knee
and
told
me
that
my
mother
and
brother
were
dead
;
that
was
why
we
did
not
go
back
.
<EOS>
I
remember
my
brother
a
little
;
he
carried
me
once
;
but
he
was
not
always
at
home
.
<EOS>
I
believed
my
father
when
he
said
that
they
were
dead
.
<EOS>
I
saw
them
under
the
earth
when
he
said
they
were
there
,
with
their
eyes
forever
closed
.
<EOS>
I
never
thought
of
its
not
being
true
;
and
I
used
to
cry
every
night
in
my
bed
for
a
long
while
.
<EOS>
Then
when
she
came
so
often
to
me
,
in
my
sleep
,
I
thought
she
must
be
living
about
me
though
I
could
not
always
see
her
,
and
that
comforted
me
.
<EOS>
I
was
never
afraid
in
the
dark
,
because
of
that
;
and
very
often
in
the
day
I
used
to
shut
my
eyes
and
bury
my
face
and
try
to
see
her
and
to
hear
her
singing
.
<EOS>
I
came
to
do
that
at
last
without
shutting
my
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mirah
paused
with
a
sweet
content
in
her
face
,
as
if
she
were
having
her
happy
vision
,
while
she
looked
out
toward
the
river
.
  
<EOS>
"
Still
your
father
was
not
unkind
to
you
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
after
a
minute
,
anxious
to
recall
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
he
petted
me
,
and
took
pains
to
teach
me
.
<EOS>
He
was
an
actor
;
and
I
found
out
,
after
,
that
the
"
Coburg
"
I
used
to
hear
of
his
going
to
at
home
was
a
theatre
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
more
to
do
with
the
theatre
than
acting
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
always
been
an
actor
;
he
had
been
a
teacher
,
and
knew
many
languages
.
<EOS>
His
acting
was
not
very
good
;
I
think
,
but
he
managed
the
stage
,
and
wrote
and
translated
plays
.
<EOS>
An
Italian
lady
,
a
singer
,
lived
with
us
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
They
both
taught
me
,
and
I
had
a
master
besides
,
who
made
me
learn
by
heart
and
recite
.
<EOS>
I
worked
quite
hard
,
though
I
was
so
little
;
and
I
was
not
nine
when
I
first
went
on
the
stage
.
<EOS>
I
could
easily
learn
things
,
and
I
was
not
afraid
.
<EOS>
But
then
and
ever
since
I
hated
our
way
of
life
.
<EOS>
My
father
had
money
,
and
we
had
finery
about
us
in
a
disorderly
way
;
always
there
were
men
and
women
coming
and
going
;
there
was
loud
laughing
and
disputing
,
strutting
,
snapping
of
fingers
,
jeering
,
faces
I
did
not
like
to
look
at
 
though
many
petted
and
caressed
me
.
<EOS>
But
then
I
remembered
my
mother
.
<EOS>
Even
at
first
when
I
understood
nothing
,
I
shrank
away
from
all
those
things
outside
me
into
companionship
with
thoughts
that
were
not
like
them
;
and
I
gathered
thoughts
very
fast
,
because
I
read
many
things
 
plays
and
poetry
,
Shakespeare
and
Schiller
,
and
learned
evil
and
good
.
<EOS>
My
father
began
to
believe
that
I
might
be
a
great
singer
:
my
voice
was
considered
wonderful
for
a
child
;
and
he
had
the
best
teaching
for
me
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
painful
that
he
boasted
of
me
,
and
set
me
to
sing
for
show
at
any
minute
,
as
if
I
had
been
a
musical
box
.
<EOS>
Once
when
I
was
nine
years
old
,
I
played
the
part
of
a
little
girl
who
had
been
forsaken
and
did
not
know
it
,
and
sat
singing
to
herself
while
she
played
with
flowers
.
<EOS>
I
did
it
without
any
trouble
;
but
the
clapping
and
all
the
sounds
of
the
theatre
were
hateful
to
me
;
and
I
never
liked
the
praise
I
had
,
because
it
all
seemed
very
hard
and
unloving
<EOS>
:
I
missed
the
love
and
trust
I
had
been
born
into
.
<EOS>
I
made
a
life
in
my
own
thoughts
quite
different
from
everything
about
me
:
I
chose
what
seemed
to
me
beautiful
out
of
the
plays
and
everything
,
and
made
my
world
out
of
it
;
and
it
was
like
a
sharp
knife
always
grazing
me
that
we
had
two
sorts
of
life
which
jarred
so
with
each
other
 
women
looking
good
and
gentle
on
the
stage
,
and
saying
good
things
as
if
they
felt
them
,
and
directly
after
I
saw
them
with
coarse
,
ugly
manners
.
<EOS>
My
father
sometimes
noticed
my
shrinking
ways
;
and
Signora
said
one
day
,
when
I
had
been
rehearsing
,
"
She
will
never
be
an
artist
:
she
has
no
notion
of
being
anybody
but
herself
.
<EOS>
That
does
very
well
now
,
but
by
-
and
-
by
you
will
see
 
she
will
have
no
more
face
and
action
than
a
singing
-
bird
.
<EOS>
"
My
father
was
angry
,
and
they
quarreled
.
<EOS>
I
sat
alone
and
cried
,
because
what
she
had
said
was
like
a
long
unhappy
future
unrolled
before
me
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
want
to
be
an
artist
;
but
this
was
what
my
father
expected
of
me
.
<EOS>
After
a
while
Signora
left
us
,
and
a
governess
used
to
come
and
give
me
lessons
in
different
things
,
because
my
father
began
to
be
afraid
of
my
singing
too
much
;
but
I
still
acted
from
time
to
time
.
<EOS>
Rebellious
feelings
grew
stronger
in
me
,
and
I
wished
to
get
away
from
this
life
;
but
I
could
not
tell
where
to
go
,
and
I
dreaded
the
world
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
felt
it
would
be
wrong
to
leave
my
father
:
I
dreaded
doing
wrong
,
for
I
thought
I
might
get
wicked
and
hateful
to
myself
,
in
the
same
way
that
many
others
seemed
hateful
to
me
.
<EOS>
For
so
long
,
so
long
I
had
never
felt
my
outside
world
happy
;
and
if
I
got
wicked
I
should
lose
my
world
of
happy
thoughts
where
my
mother
lived
with
me
.
<EOS>
That
was
my
childish
notion
all
through
those
years
.
<EOS>
Oh
how
long
they
were
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mirah
fell
to
musing
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Had
you
no
teaching
about
what
was
your
duty
?
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
like
to
say
"
religion
"
 
finding
herself
on
inspection
rather
dim
as
to
what
the
Hebrew
religion
might
have
turned
into
at
this
date
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
 
only
that
I
ought
to
do
what
my
father
wished
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
follow
our
religion
at
New
York
,
and
I
think
he
wanted
me
not
to
know
much
about
it
.
<EOS>
But
because
my
mother
used
to
take
me
to
the
synagogue
,
and
I
remembered
sitting
on
her
knee
and
looking
through
the
railing
and
hearing
the
chanting
and
singing
,
I
longed
to
go
.
<EOS>
One
day
when
I
was
quite
small
I
slipped
out
and
tried
to
find
the
synagogue
,
but
I
lost
myself
a
long
while
till
a
peddler
questioned
me
and
took
me
home
.
<EOS>
My
father
,
missing
me
,
had
been
much
in
fear
,
and
was
very
angry
.
<EOS>
I
too
had
been
so
frightened
at
losing
myself
that
it
was
long
before
I
thought
of
venturing
out
again
.
<EOS>
But
after
Signora
left
us
we
went
to
rooms
where
our
landlady
was
a
Jewess
and
observed
her
religion
.
<EOS>
I
asked
her
to
take
me
with
her
to
the
synagogue
;
and
I
read
in
her
prayer
-
books
and
Bible
,
and
when
I
had
money
enough
I
asked
her
to
buy
me
books
of
my
own
,
for
these
books
<EOS>
seemed
a
closer
companionship
with
my
mother
<EOS>
:
I
knew
that
she
must
have
looked
at
the
very
words
and
said
them
.
<EOS>
In
that
way
I
have
come
to
know
a
little
of
our
religion
,
and
the
history
of
our
people
,
besides
piecing
together
what
I
read
in
plays
and
other
books
about
Jews
and
Jewesses
;
because
I
was
sure
my
mother
obeyed
her
religion
.
<EOS>
I
had
left
off
asking
my
father
about
her
.
<EOS>
It
is
very
dreadful
to
say
it
,
but
I
began
to
disbelieve
him
.
<EOS>
I
had
found
that
he
did
not
always
tell
the
truth
,
and
made
promises
without
meaning
to
keep
them
;
and
that
raised
my
suspicion
that
my
mother
and
brother
were
still
alive
though
he
had
told
me
they
were
dead
.
<EOS>
For
in
going
over
the
past
again
as
I
got
older
and
knew
more
,
I
felt
sure
that
my
mother
had
been
deceived
,
and
had
expected
to
see
us
back
again
after
a
very
little
while
;
and
my
father
taking
me
on
his
knee
and
telling
me
that
my
mother
and
brother
were
both
dead
seemed
to
me
now
but
a
bit
of
acting
,
to
set
my
mind
at
rest
.
<EOS>
The
cruelty
of
that
falsehood
sank
into
me
,
and
I
hated
all
untruth
because
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
wrote
to
my
mother
secretly
:
<EOS>
I
knew
the
street
,
Colman
Street
,
where
we
lived
,
and
that
it
was
not
Blackfriars
Bridge
and
the
Coburg
,
and
that
our
name
was
Cohen
then
,
though
my
father
called
us
Lapidoth
,
because
,
he
said
,
it
was
a
name
of
his
forefathers
in
Poland
.
<EOS>
I
sent
my
letter
secretly
;
but
no
answer
came
,
and
I
thought
there
was
no
hope
for
me
.
<EOS>
Our
life
in
America
did
not
last
much
longer
.
<EOS>
My
father
suddenly
told
me
we
were
to
pack
up
and
go
to
Hamburg
,
and
I
was
rather
glad
.
<EOS>
I
hoped
we
might
get
among
a
different
sort
of
people
,
and
I
knew
German
quite
well
 
<EOS>
some
German
plays
almost
all
by
heart
.
<EOS>
My
father
spoke
it
better
than
he
spoke
English
.
<EOS>
I
was
thirteen
then
,
and
I
seemed
to
myself
quite
old
 
<EOS>
I
knew
so
much
,
and
yet
so
little
.
<EOS>
I
think
other
children
can
not
feel
as
I
did
.
<EOS>
I
had
often
wished
that
I
had
been
drowned
when
I
was
going
away
from
my
mother
.
<EOS>
But
I
set
myself
to
obey
and
suffer
:
what
else
could
I
do
?
<EOS>
One
day
when
we
were
on
our
voyage
,
a
new
thought
came
into
my
mind
.
<EOS>
I
was
not
very
ill
that
time
,
and
I
kept
on
deck
a
good
deal
.
<EOS>
My
father
acted
and
sang
and
joked
to
amuse
people
on
board
,
and
I
used
often
to
hear
remarks
about
him
.
<EOS>
One
day
,
when
I
was
looking
at
the
sea
and
nobody
took
notice
of
me
,
I
overheard
a
gentleman
say
,
"
Oh
,
he
is
one
of
those
clever
Jews
 
<EOS>
a
rascal
,
I
should
n't
wonder
.
<EOS>
There
's
no
race
like
them
for
cunning
in
the
men
and
beauty
in
the
women
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
market
he
means
that
daughter
for
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
heard
this
it
darted
into
my
mind
that
the
unhappiness
in
my
life
came
from
my
being
a
Jewess
,
and
that
always
to
the
end
the
world
would
think
slightly
of
me
and
that
I
must
bear
it
,
for
I
should
be
judged
by
that
name
;
and
it
comforted
me
to
believe
that
my
suffering
was
part
of
the
affliction
of
my
people
,
my
part
in
the
long
song
of
mourning
that
has
been
going
on
through
ages
and
ages
.
<EOS>
For
if
many
of
our
race
were
wicked
and
made
merry
in
their
wickedness
 
<EOS>
what
was
that
<EOS>
but
part
of
the
affliction
borne
by
the
just
among
them
,
who
were
despised
for
the
sins
of
their
brethren
?
 
<EOS>
But
you
have
not
rejected
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mirah
had
changed
her
tone
in
this
last
sentence
,
having
suddenly
reflected
that
at
this
moment
she
had
reason
not
for
complaint
but
for
gratitude
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
we
will
try
to
save
you
from
being
judged
unjustly
by
others
,
my
poor
child
,
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
who
had
now
given
up
all
attempt
at
going
on
with
her
work
,
and
sat
listening
with
folded
hands
and
a
face
hardly
less
eager
than
Mab
's
would
have
been
.
<EOS>
"
Go
on
,
go
on
:
tell
me
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
After
that
we
lived
in
different
towns
 
Hamburg
and
Vienna
,
the
longest
.
<EOS>
I
began
to
study
singing
again
:
and
my
father
always
got
money
about
the
theatres
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
brought
a
good
deal
of
money
from
America
,
I
never
knew
why
we
left
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
he
was
in
great
spirits
about
my
singing
,
and
he
made
me
rehearse
parts
and
act
continually
.
<EOS>
He
looked
forward
to
my
coming
out
in
the
opera
.
<EOS>
But
by
-
and
-
by
it
seemed
that
my
voice
would
never
be
strong
enough
 
<EOS>
it
did
not
fulfill
its
promise
.
<EOS>
My
master
at
Vienna
said
,
"
Do
n't
strain
it
further
:
it
will
never
do
for
the
public
:
 
<EOS>
it
is
gold
,
but
a
thread
of
gold
dust
.
<EOS>
"
My
father
was
bitterly
disappointed
:
we
were
not
so
well
off
at
that
time
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
not
quite
told
you
what
I
felt
about
my
father
.
<EOS>
I
knew
he
was
fond
of
me
and
meant
to
indulge
me
,
and
that
made
me
afraid
of
hurting
him
;
but
he
always
mistook
what
would
please
me
and
give
me
happiness
.
<EOS>
It
was
his
nature
to
take
everything
lightly
;
and
I
soon
left
off
asking
him
any
questions
about
things
that
I
cared
for
much
,
because
he
always
turned
them
off
with
a
joke
.
<EOS>
He
would
even
ridicule
our
own
people
;
and
once
when
he
had
been
imitating
their
movements
and
their
tones
in
praying
,
only
to
make
others
laugh
,
I
could
not
restrain
myself
 
for
I
always
had
an
anger
in
my
heart
about
my
mother
 
<EOS>
and
when
we
were
alone
,
I
said
,
"
Father
,
you
ought
not
to
mimic
our
own
people
before
Christians
who
mock
them
:
would
it
not
be
bad
if
I
mimicked
you
,
that
they
might
mock
you
?
"
<EOS>
But
he
only
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
laughed
and
pinched
my
chin
,
and
said
,
'
You
could
n't
do
it
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
this
way
of
turning
off
everything
,
that
made
a
great
wall
between
me
and
my
father
,
and
whatever
I
felt
most
<EOS>
I
took
the
most
care
to
hide
from
him
.
<EOS>
For
there
were
some
things
 
when
they
were
laughed
at
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
it
:
the
world
seemed
like
a
hell
to
me
.
<EOS>
Is
this
world
and
all
the
life
upon
it
only
like
a
farce
or
a
vaudeville
,
where
you
find
no
great
meanings
?
<EOS>
Why
then
are
there
tragedies
and
grand
operas
,
where
men
do
difficult
things
and
choose
to
suffer
?
<EOS>
I
think
it
is
silly
to
speak
of
all
things
as
a
joke
.
<EOS>
And
I
saw
that
his
wishing
me
to
sing
the
greatest
music
,
and
parts
in
grand
operas
,
was
only
wishing
for
what
would
fetch
the
greatest
price
.
<EOS>
That
hemmed
in
my
gratitude
for
his
affectionateness
,
and
the
tenderest
feeling
I
had
toward
him
was
pity
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
did
sometimes
pity
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
aged
and
changed
.
<EOS>
Now
he
was
no
longer
so
lively
.
<EOS>
I
thought
he
seemed
worse
 
less
good
to
others
than
to
me
.
<EOS>
Every
now
and
then
in
the
latter
years
his
gaiety
went
away
suddenly
,
and
he
would
sit
at
home
silent
and
gloomy
;
or
he
would
come
in
and
fling
himself
down
and
sob
,
just
as
I
have
done
myself
when
I
have
been
in
trouble
.
<EOS>
If
I
put
my
hand
on
his
knee
and
say
,
"
What
is
the
matter
,
father
?
"
he
would
make
no
answer
,
but
would
draw
my
arm
round
his
neck
and
put
his
arm
round
me
and
go
on
crying
.
<EOS>
There
never
came
any
confidence
between
us
;
but
oh
,
I
was
sorry
for
him
.
<EOS>
At
those
moments
I
knew
he
must
feel
his
life
bitter
,
and
I
pressed
my
cheek
against
his
head
and
prayed
.
<EOS>
Those
moments
were
what
most
bound
me
to
him
;
and
I
used
to
think
how
much
my
mother
once
loved
him
,
else
she
would
not
have
married
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
soon
there
came
the
dreadful
time
.
<EOS>
We
had
been
at
Pesth
and
we
came
back
to
Vienna
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
what
my
master
Leo
had
said
,
my
father
got
me
an
engagement
,
not
at
the
opera
,
but
to
take
singing
parts
at
a
suburb
theatre
in
Vienna
.
<EOS>
He
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
theatre
then
;
I
did
not
understand
what
he
did
,
but
I
think
he
was
continually
at
a
gambling
house
,
though
he
was
careful
always
about
taking
me
to
the
theatre
.
<EOS>
I
was
very
miserable
.
<EOS>
The
plays
I
acted
in
were
detestable
to
me
.
<EOS>
Men
came
about
us
and
wanted
to
talk
to
me
<EOS>
:
women
and
men
seemed
to
look
at
me
with
a
sneering
smile
;
it
was
no
better
than
a
fiery
furnace
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
make
it
worse
than
it
was
 
<EOS>
you
do
n't
know
that
life
:
but
the
glare
and
the
faces
,
and
my
having
to
go
on
and
act
and
sing
what
I
hated
,
and
then
see
people
who
came
to
stare
at
me
behind
the
scenes
 
<EOS>
it
was
all
so
much
worse
than
when
I
was
a
little
girl
.
<EOS>
I
went
through
with
it
;
I
did
it
;
I
had
set
my
mind
to
obey
my
father
and
work
,
for
I
saw
nothing
better
that
I
could
do
.
<EOS>
But
I
felt
that
my
voice
was
getting
weaker
,
and
I
knew
that
my
acting
was
not
good
except
when
it
was
not
really
acting
,
but
the
part
was
one
that
I
could
be
myself
in
,
and
some
feeling
within
me
carried
me
along
.
<EOS>
That
was
seldom
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
in
the
midst
of
all
this
,
the
news
came
to
me
one
morning
that
my
father
had
been
taken
to
prison
,
and
he
had
sent
for
me
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
tell
me
the
reason
why
he
was
there
,
but
he
ordered
me
to
go
to
an
address
he
gave
me
,
to
see
a
Count
who
would
be
able
to
get
him
released
.
<EOS>
The
address
was
to
some
public
rooms
where
I
was
to
ask
for
the
Count
,
and
beg
him
to
come
to
my
father
.
<EOS>
I
found
him
,
and
recognized
him
as
a
gentleman
whom
I
had
seen
the
other
night
for
the
first
time
behind
the
scenes
.
<EOS>
That
agitated
me
,
for
I
remembered
his
way
of
looking
at
me
and
kissing
my
hand
 
<EOS>
I
thought
it
was
in
mockery
.
<EOS>
But
I
delivered
my
errand
,
and
he
promised
to
go
immediately
to
my
father
,
who
came
home
again
that
very
evening
,
bringing
the
Count
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
now
began
to
feel
a
horrible
dread
of
this
man
,
for
he
worried
me
with
his
attentions
,
his
eyes
were
always
on
me
:
I
felt
sure
that
whatever
else
there
might
be
in
his
mind
toward
me
,
below
it
all
there
was
scorn
for
the
Jewess
and
the
actress
.
<EOS>
And
when
he
came
to
me
the
next
day
in
the
theatre
and
would
put
my
shawl
around
me
,
a
terror
took
hold
of
me
;
I
saw
that
my
father
wanted
me
to
look
pleased
.
<EOS>
The
Count
was
neither
very
young
nor
very
old
;
his
hair
and
eyes
were
pale
;
he
was
tall
and
walked
heavily
,
and
his
face
was
heavy
and
grave
except
when
he
looked
at
me
.
<EOS>
He
smiled
at
me
,
and
his
smile
went
through
me
with
horror
:
<EOS>
I
could
not
tell
why
he
was
so
much
worse
to
me
than
other
men
.
<EOS>
Some
feelings
are
like
our
hearing
:
they
come
as
sounds
do
,
before
we
know
their
reason
.
<EOS>
My
father
talked
to
me
about
him
when
we
were
alone
,
and
praised
him
 
said
what
a
good
friend
he
had
been
.
<EOS>
I
said
nothing
,
because
I
supposed
he
had
got
my
father
out
of
prison
.
<EOS>
When
the
Count
came
again
,
my
father
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
asked
me
if
I
liked
being
on
the
stage
.
<EOS>
I
said
No
,
I
only
acted
in
obedience
to
my
father
.
<EOS>
He
always
spoke
French
,
and
called
me
"
petite
ange
"
and
such
things
,
which
I
felt
insulting
.
<EOS>
I
knew
he
meant
to
make
love
to
me
,
and
I
had
it
firmly
in
my
mind
that
a
nobleman
and
one
who
was
not
a
Jew
could
have
no
love
for
me
that
was
not
half
contempt
.
<EOS>
But
then
he
told
me
that
I
need
not
act
any
longer
;
he
wished
me
to
visit
him
at
his
beautiful
place
,
where
I
might
be
queen
of
everything
.
<EOS>
It
was
difficult
to
me
to
speak
,
I
felt
so
shaken
with
anger
:
I
could
only
say
,
"
I
would
rather
stay
on
the
stage
forever
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
left
him
there
.
<EOS>
Hurrying
out
of
the
room
I
saw
my
father
sauntering
in
the
passage
.
<EOS>
My
heart
was
crushed
.
<EOS>
I
went
past
him
and
locked
myself
up
.
<EOS>
It
had
sunk
into
me
that
my
father
was
in
a
conspiracy
with
that
man
against
me
.
<EOS>
But
the
next
day
he
persuaded
me
to
come
out
:
he
said
that
I
had
mistaken
everything
,
and
he
would
explain
:
if
I
did
not
come
out
and
act
and
fulfill
my
engagement
,
we
should
be
ruined
and
he
must
starve
.
<EOS>
So
I
went
on
acting
,
and
for
a
week
or
more
the
Count
never
came
near
me
.
<EOS>
My
father
changed
our
lodgings
,
and
kept
at
home
except
when
he
went
to
the
theatre
with
me
.
<EOS>
He
began
one
day
to
speak
discouragingly
of
my
acting
,
and
say
,
I
could
never
go
on
singing
in
public
 
<EOS>
I
should
lose
my
voice
 
<EOS>
I
ought
to
think
of
my
future
,
and
not
put
my
nonsensical
feelings
between
me
and
my
fortune
.
<EOS>
He
said
,
"
What
will
you
do
?
<EOS>
You
will
be
brought
down
to
sing
and
beg
at
people
's
doors
.
<EOS>
You
have
had
a
splendid
offer
and
ought
to
accept
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
speak
:
a
horror
took
possession
of
me
when
I
thought
of
my
mother
and
of
him
.
<EOS>
I
felt
for
the
first
time
that
I
should
not
do
wrong
to
leave
him
.
<EOS>
But
the
next
day
he
told
me
that
he
had
put
an
end
to
my
engagement
at
the
theatre
,
and
that
we
were
to
go
to
Prague
.
<EOS>
I
was
getting
suspicious
of
everything
,
and
my
will
was
hardening
to
act
against
him
.
<EOS>
It
took
us
two
days
to
pack
and
get
ready
;
and
I
had
it
in
my
mind
that
I
might
be
obliged
to
run
away
from
my
father
,
and
then
I
would
come
to
London
and
try
if
it
were
possible
to
find
my
mother
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
little
money
,
and
I
sold
some
things
to
get
more
.
<EOS>
I
packed
a
few
clothes
in
a
little
bag
that
I
could
carry
with
me
,
and
I
kept
my
mind
on
the
watch
.
<EOS>
My
father
's
silence
 
<EOS>
his
letting
drop
<EOS>
that
subject
of
the
Count
's
offer
 
made
me
feel
sure
that
there
was
a
plan
against
me
.
<EOS>
I
felt
as
if
it
had
been
a
plan
to
take
me
to
a
madhouse
.
<EOS>
I
once
saw
a
picture
of
a
madhouse
,
that
I
could
never
forget
;
it
seemed
to
me
very
much
like
some
of
the
life
I
had
seen
 
the
people
strutting
,
quarreling
,
leering
 
the
faces
with
cunning
and
malice
in
them
.
<EOS>
It
was
my
will
to
keep
myself
from
wickedness
;
and
I
prayed
for
help
.
<EOS>
I
had
seen
what
despised
women
were
:
and
my
heart
turned
against
my
father
,
for
I
saw
always
behind
him
that
man
who
made
me
shudder
.
<EOS>
You
will
think
I
had
not
enough
reason
for
my
suspicions
,
and
perhaps
I
had
not
,
outside
my
own
feeling
;
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
my
mind
had
been
lit
up
,
and
all
that
might
be
stood
out
clear
and
sharp
.
<EOS>
If
I
slept
,
it
was
only
to
see
the
same
sort
of
things
,
and
I
could
hardly
sleep
at
all
.
<EOS>
Through
our
journey
I
was
everywhere
on
the
watch
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
why
,
but
it
came
before
me
like
a
real
event
,
that
my
father
would
suddenly
leave
me
and
I
should
find
myself
with
the
Count
where
I
could
not
get
away
from
him
.
<EOS>
I
thought
God
was
warning
me
:
my
mother
's
voice
was
in
my
soul
.
<EOS>
It
was
dark
when
we
reached
Prague
,
and
though
the
strange
bunches
of
lamps
were
lit
it
was
difficult
to
distinguish
faces
as
we
drove
along
the
street
.
<EOS>
My
father
chose
to
sit
outside
 
<EOS>
he
was
always
smoking
now
 
<EOS>
and
I
watched
everything
in
spite
of
the
darkness
.
<EOS>
I
do
believe
I
could
see
better
then
than
I
ever
did
before
:
the
strange
clearness
within
seemed
to
have
got
outside
me
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
my
habit
to
notice
faces
and
figures
much
in
the
street
;
but
this
night
I
saw
every
one
;
and
when
we
passed
before
a
great
hotel
I
caught
sight
only
of
a
back
that
was
passing
in
 
the
light
of
the
great
bunch
of
lamps
a
good
way
off
fell
on
it
.
<EOS>
I
knew
it
 
<EOS>
before
the
face
was
turned
,
as
it
fell
into
shadow
,
I
knew
who
it
was
.
<EOS>
Help
came
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
feel
sure
help
came
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
sleep
that
night
.
<EOS>
I
put
on
my
plainest
things
 
the
cloak
and
hat
<EOS>
I
have
worn
ever
since
;
and
I
sat
watching
for
the
light
and
the
sound
of
the
doors
being
unbarred
.
<EOS>
Some
one
rose
early
 
at
four
o'clock
,
to
go
to
the
railway
.
<EOS>
That
gave
me
courage
.
<EOS>
I
slipped
out
,
with
my
little
bag
under
my
cloak
,
and
none
noticed
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
been
a
long
while
attending
to
the
railway
guide
that
I
might
learn
the
way
to
England
;
and
before
the
sun
had
risen
I
was
in
the
train
for
Dresden
.
<EOS>
Then
I
cried
for
joy
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
know
whether
my
money
would
last
out
,
but
I
trusted
.
<EOS>
I
could
sell
the
things
in
my
bag
,
and
the
little
rings
in
my
ears
,
and
I
could
live
on
bread
only
.
<EOS>
My
only
terror
was
lest
my
father
should
follow
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
never
paused
.
<EOS>
I
came
on
,
and
on
,
and
on
,
only
eating
bread
now
and
then
.
<EOS>
When
I
got
to
Brussels
<EOS>
I
saw
that
I
should
not
have
enough
money
,
and
I
sold
all
that
I
could
sell
;
but
here
a
strange
thing
happened
.
<EOS>
Putting
my
hand
into
the
pocket
of
my
cloak
,
I
found
a
half
-
napoleon
.
<EOS>
Wondering
and
wondering
how
it
came
there
,
I
remembered
that
on
the
way
from
Cologne
there
was
a
young
workman
sitting
against
me
.
<EOS>
I
was
frightened
at
every
one
,
and
did
not
like
to
be
spoken
to
.
<EOS>
At
first
he
tried
to
talk
,
but
when
he
saw
that
I
did
not
like
it
,
he
left
off
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
long
journey
;
I
ate
nothing
but
a
bit
of
bread
,
and
he
once
offered
me
some
of
the
food
he
brought
in
,
but
I
refused
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
believe
it
was
he
who
put
that
bit
of
gold
in
my
pocket
.
<EOS>
Without
it
I
could
hardly
have
got
to
Dover
,
and
I
did
walk
a
good
deal
of
the
way
from
Dover
to
London
.
<EOS>
I
knew
I
should
look
like
a
miserable
beggar
-
girl
.
<EOS>
I
wanted
not
to
look
very
miserable
,
because
if
I
found
my
mother
it
would
grieve
her
to
see
me
so
.
<EOS>
But
oh
,
how
vain
my
hope
was
that
she
would
be
there
to
see
me
come
!
<EOS>
As
soon
as
I
set
foot
in
London
,
I
began
to
ask
for
Lambeth
and
Blackfriars
Bridge
,
but
they
were
a
long
way
off
,
and
I
went
wrong
.
<EOS>
At
last
I
got
to
Blackfriars
Bridge
and
asked
for
Colman
Street
.
<EOS>
People
shook
their
heads
.
<EOS>
None
knew
it
.
<EOS>
I
saw
it
in
my
mind
 
our
doorsteps
,
and
the
white
tiles
hung
in
the
windows
,
and
the
large
brick
building
opposite
with
wide
doors
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
nothing
like
it
.
<EOS>
At
last
when
I
asked
a
tradesman
where
the
Coburg
Theatre
and
Colman
Street
were
,
he
said
,
"
Oh
,
my
little
woman
,
that
's
all
done
away
with
.
<EOS>
The
old
streets
have
been
pulled
down
;
everything
is
new
.
<EOS>
"
I
turned
away
and
felt
as
if
death
had
laid
a
hand
on
me
.
<EOS>
He
said
:
"
Stop
,
stop
!
<EOS>
young
woman
;
what
is
it
you
're
wanting
with
Colman
Street
,
eh
?
"
<EOS>
meaning
well
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
But
his
tone
was
what
I
could
not
bear
;
and
how
could
I
tell
him
what
I
wanted
?
<EOS>
I
felt
blinded
and
bewildered
with
a
sudden
shock
.
<EOS>
I
suddenly
felt
that
I
was
very
weak
and
weary
,
and
yet
where
could
I
go
?
<EOS>
for
I
looked
so
poor
and
dusty
,
and
had
nothing
with
me
 
<EOS>
I
looked
like
a
street
-
beggar
.
<EOS>
And
I
was
afraid
of
all
places
where
I
could
enter
.
<EOS>
I
lost
my
trust
.
<EOS>
I
thought
I
was
forsaken
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
that
I
had
been
in
a
fever
of
hope
 
<EOS>
delirious
 
all
the
way
from
Prague
<EOS>
:
I
thought
that
I
was
helped
,
and
I
did
nothing
but
strain
my
mind
forward
and
think
of
finding
my
mother
;
and
now
 
there
I
stood
in
a
strange
world
.
<EOS>
All
who
saw
me
would
think
ill
of
me
,
and
I
must
herd
with
beggars
.
<EOS>
I
stood
on
the
bridge
and
looked
along
the
river
.
<EOS>
People
were
going
on
to
a
steamboat
.
<EOS>
Many
of
them
seemed
poor
,
and
I
felt
as
if
it
would
be
a
refuge
to
get
away
from
the
streets
;
perhaps
the
boat
would
take
me
where
I
could
soon
get
into
a
solitude
.
<EOS>
I
had
still
some
pence
left
,
and
I
bought
a
loaf
when
I
went
on
the
boat
.
<EOS>
I
wanted
to
have
a
little
time
and
strength
to
think
of
life
and
death
.
<EOS>
How
could
I
live
?
<EOS>
And
now
again
it
seemed
that
if
ever
I
were
to
find
my
mother
again
,
death
was
the
way
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
ate
,
that
I
might
have
strength
to
think
.
<EOS>
The
boat
set
me
down
at
a
place
along
the
river
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
where
 
<EOS>
and
it
was
late
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
I
found
some
large
trees
apart
from
the
road
,
and
I
sat
down
under
them
that
I
might
rest
through
the
night
.
<EOS>
Sleep
must
have
soon
come
to
me
,
and
when
I
awoke
it
was
morning
.
<EOS>
The
birds
were
singing
,
and
the
dew
was
white
about
me
,
I
felt
chill
<EOS>
and
oh
,
so
lonely
!
<EOS>
I
got
up
and
walked
and
followed
the
river
a
long
way
and
then
turned
back
again
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
reason
why
I
should
go
anywhere
.
<EOS>
The
world
about
me
seemed
like
a
vision
that
was
hurrying
by
while
I
stood
still
with
my
pain
.
<EOS>
My
thoughts
were
stronger
than
I
was
;
they
rushed
in
and
forced
me
to
see
all
my
life
from
the
beginning
;
ever
since
I
was
carried
away
from
my
mother
<EOS>
I
had
felt
myself
a
lost
child
taken
up
and
used
by
strangers
,
who
did
not
care
what
my
life
was
to
me
,
but
only
what
I
could
do
for
them
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
all
a
weary
wandering
and
heart
-
loneliness
 
as
if
I
had
been
forced
to
go
to
merrymakings
without
the
expectation
of
joy
.
<EOS>
And
now
it
was
worse
.
<EOS>
I
was
lost
again
,
and
I
dreaded
lest
any
stranger
should
notice
me
and
speak
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
terror
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
None
knew
me
;
all
would
mistake
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
seen
so
many
in
my
life
who
made
themselves
glad
with
scorning
,
and
laughed
at
another
's
shame
.
<EOS>
What
could
I
do
?
<EOS>
This
life
seemed
to
be
closing
in
upon
me
with
a
wall
of
fire
 
everywhere
there
was
scorching
that
made
me
shrink
.
<EOS>
The
high
sunlight
made
me
shrink
.
<EOS>
And
I
began
to
think
that
my
despair
was
the
voice
of
God
telling
me
to
die
.
<EOS>
But
it
would
take
me
long
to
die
of
hunger
.
<EOS>
Then
I
thought
of
my
people
,
how
they
had
been
driven
from
land
to
land
and
been
afflicted
,
and
multitudes
had
died
of
misery
in
their
wandering
 
<EOS>
was
I
the
first
?
<EOS>
And
in
the
wars
and
troubles
when
Christians
were
cruelest
,
our
fathers
had
sometimes
slain
their
children
and
afterward
themselves
<EOS>
:
it
was
to
save
them
from
being
false
apostates
.
<EOS>
That
seemed
to
make
it
right
for
me
to
put
an
end
to
my
life
;
for
calamity
had
closed
me
in
too
,
and
I
saw
no
pathway
but
to
evil
.
<EOS>
But
my
mind
got
into
war
with
itself
,
for
there
were
contrary
things
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
knew
that
some
had
held
it
wrong
to
hasten
their
own
death
,
though
they
were
in
the
midst
of
flames
;
and
while
I
had
some
strength
left
<EOS>
it
was
a
longing
to
bear
if
I
ought
to
bear
 
else
<EOS>
where
was
the
good
of
all
my
life
?
<EOS>
It
had
not
been
happy
since
the
first
years
:
when
the
light
came
every
morning
I
used
to
think
,
"
I
will
bear
it
.
"
<EOS>
But
always
before
I
had
some
hope
;
now
it
was
gone
.
<EOS>
With
these
thoughts
I
wandered
and
wandered
,
inwardly
crying
to
the
Most
High
,
from
whom
I
should
not
flee
in
death
more
than
in
life
 
though
I
had
no
strong
faith
that
He
cared
for
me
.
<EOS>
The
strength
seemed
departing
from
my
soul
;
deep
below
all
my
cries
was
the
feeling
that
I
was
alone
and
forsaken
.
<EOS>
The
more
I
thought
the
wearier
I
got
,
<EOS>
till
it
seemed
I
was
not
thinking
at
all
,
but
only
the
sky
and
the
river
and
the
Eternal
God
were
in
my
soul
.
<EOS>
And
what
was
it
whether
I
died
or
lived
?
<EOS>
If
I
lay
down
to
die
in
the
river
,
was
it
more
than
lying
down
to
sleep
?
 
<EOS>
for
there
too
I
committed
my
soul
 
<EOS>
I
gave
myself
up
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
memories
any
more
;
I
could
only
feel
what
was
present
in
me
 
<EOS>
it
was
all
one
longing
to
cease
from
my
weary
life
,
which
seemed
only
a
pain
outside
the
great
peace
that
I
might
enter
into
.
<EOS>
That
was
how
it
was
.
<EOS>
When
the
evening
came
and
the
sun
was
gone
<EOS>
,
it
seemed
as
if
that
was
all
I
had
to
wait
for
.
<EOS>
And
a
new
strength
came
into
me
to
will
what
I
would
do
.
<EOS>
You
know
what
I
did
.
<EOS>
I
was
going
to
die
.
<EOS>
You
know
what
happened
 
did
he
not
tell
you
?
<EOS>
Faith
came
to
me
again
;
I
was
not
forsaken
.
<EOS>
He
told
you
how
he
found
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Meyrick
gave
no
audible
answer
,
but
pressed
her
lips
against
Mirah
's
forehead
.
         
<EOS>
*
      
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
She
's
just
a
pearl
;
the
mud
has
only
washed
her
,
"
was
the
fervid
little
woman
's
closing
commentary
when
,
_
tete
-
à
-
tete
_
with
Deronda
in
the
back
parlor
that
evening
,
she
had
conveyed
Mirah
's
story
to
him
with
much
vividness
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
your
feeling
about
a
search
for
this
mother
?
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
you
no
fears
?
<EOS>
I
have
,
I
confess
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
believe
the
mother
's
good
,
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
with
rapid
decisiveness
;
"
or
_
was
_
good
.
<EOS>
She
may
be
dead
 
<EOS>
that
's
my
fear
.
<EOS>
A
good
woman
,
you
may
depend
:
you
may
know
it
by
the
scoundrel
the
father
is
.
<EOS>
Where
did
the
child
get
her
goodness
from
?
<EOS>
Wheaten
flour
has
to
be
accounted
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
was
rather
disappointed
at
this
answer
;
he
had
wanted
a
confirmation
of
his
own
judgment
,
and
he
began
to
put
in
demurrers
.
<EOS>
The
argument
about
the
mother
would
not
apply
to
the
brother
;
and
Mrs.
Meyrick
admitted
that
the
brother
might
be
an
ugly
likeness
of
the
father
.
<EOS>
Then
,
as
to
advertising
,
if
the
name
was
Cohen
,
you
might
as
well
advertise
for
two
undescribed
terriers
;
and
here
Mrs.
Meyrick
helped
him
,
for
the
idea
of
an
advertisement
,
already
mentioned
to
Mirah
,
had
roused
the
poor
child
's
terror
;
she
was
convinced
that
her
father
would
see
it
 
<EOS>
he
saw
everything
in
the
papers
.
<EOS>
Certainly
there
were
safer
means
than
advertising
;
men
might
be
set
to
work
whose
business
it
was
to
find
missing
persons
;
but
Deronda
wished
Mrs.
Meyrick
to
feel
with
him
that
it
would
be
wiser
to
wait
,
before
seeking
a
dubious
 
perhaps
a
deplorable
result
;
especially
as
he
was
engaged
to
go
abroad
the
next
week
for
a
couple
of
months
.
<EOS>
If
a
search
were
made
,
he
would
like
to
be
at
hand
,
so
that
Mrs.
Meyrick
might
not
be
unaided
in
meeting
any
consequences
 
<EOS>
supposing
that
she
would
generously
continue
to
watch
over
Mirah
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
should
be
very
jealous
of
any
one
who
took
the
task
from
us
,
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
.
<EOS>
"
She
will
stay
under
my
roof
;
there
is
Hans
's
old
room
for
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
she
be
content
to
wait
?
"
said
Deronda
,
anxiously
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
trouble
there
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
her
nature
to
run
into
planning
and
devising
:
only
to
submit
.
<EOS>
See
how
she
submitted
to
that
father
!
<EOS>
It
was
a
wonder
to
herself
how
she
found
the
will
and
contrivance
to
run
away
from
him
.
<EOS>
About
finding
her
mother
,
her
only
notion
now
is
to
trust
;
since
you
were
sent
to
save
her
and
we
are
good
to
her
,
she
trusts
that
her
mother
will
be
found
in
the
same
unsought
way
.
<EOS>
And
when
she
is
talking
I
catch
her
feeling
like
a
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Meyrick
hoped
that
the
sum
Deronda
put
into
her
hands
as
a
provision
for
Mirah
's
wants
was
more
than
would
be
needed
;
after
a
little
while
Mirah
would
perhaps
like
to
occupy
herself
as
the
other
girls
did
,
and
make
herself
independent
.
<EOS>
Deronda
pleaded
that
she
must
need
a
long
rest
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes
;
we
will
hurry
nothing
,
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
.
  
<EOS>
"
Rely
upon
it
,
she
shall
be
taken
tender
care
of
.
<EOS>
If
you
like
to
give
me
your
address
abroad
,
I
will
write
to
let
you
know
how
we
get
on
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
fair
that
we
should
have
all
the
pleasure
of
her
salvation
to
ourselves
.
<EOS>
And
besides
,
I
want
to
make
believe
that
I
am
doing
something
for
you
as
well
as
for
Mirah
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
no
make
-
believe
.
<EOS>
What
should
I
have
done
without
you
last
night
?
<EOS>
Everything
would
have
gone
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
shall
tell
Hans
that
the
best
of
having
him
for
a
friend
is
,
knowing
his
mother
.
"
  
<EOS>
After
that
they
joined
the
girls
in
the
other
room
,
where
Mirah
was
seated
placidly
,
while
the
others
were
telling
her
what
they
knew
about
Mr.
Deronda
 
his
goodness
to
Hans
,
and
all
the
virtues
that
Hans
had
reported
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Kate
burns
a
pastille
before
his
portrait
every
day
,
"
said
Mab
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
carry
his
signature
in
a
little
black
-
silk
bag
<EOS>
round
my
neck
to
keep
off
the
cramp
.
<EOS>
And
Amy
says
the
multiplication
-
table
in
his
name
.
<EOS>
We
must
all
do
something
extra
in
honor
of
him
,
now
he
has
brought
you
to
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
is
too
great
a
person
to
want
anything
,
"
said
Mirah
,
smiling
at
Mab
,
and
appealing
to
the
graver
Amy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
perhaps
very
high
in
the
world
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
very
much
above
us
in
rank
,
"
said
Amy
.
<EOS>
"
He
is
related
to
grand
people
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
he
leans
on
some
of
the
satin
cushions
we
prick
our
fingers
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
he
is
of
high
rank
,
"
said
Mirah
,
with
her
usual
quietness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
why
are
you
glad
of
that
?
"
said
Amy
,
rather
suspicious
of
this
sentiment
,
and
on
the
watch
for
Jewish
peculiarities
which
had
not
appeared
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
have
always
disliked
men
of
high
rank
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr.
Deronda
is
not
so
very
high
,
"
said
Kate
,
"
He
need
not
hinder
us
from
thinking
ill
of
the
whole
peerage
and
baronetage
if
we
like
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
he
entered
,
Mirah
rose
with
the
same
look
of
grateful
reverence
that
she
had
lifted
to
him
the
evening
before
:
impossible
to
see
a
creature
freer
at
once
from
embarrassment
and
boldness
.
<EOS>
Her
theatrical
training
had
left
no
recognizable
trace
;
probably
her
manners
had
not
much
changed
since
she
played
the
forsaken
child
at
nine
years
of
age
;
and
she
had
grown
up
in
her
simplicity
and
truthfulness
like
a
little
flower
-
seed
that
absorbs
the
chance
confusion
of
its
surrounding
into
its
own
definite
mould
of
beauty
.
<EOS>
Deronda
felt
that
he
was
making
acquaintance
with
something
quite
new
to
him
in
the
form
of
womanhood
.
<EOS>
For
Mirah
was
not
childlike
from
ignorance
:
her
experience
of
evil
and
trouble
was
deeper
and
stranger
than
his
own
.
<EOS>
He
felt
inclined
to
watch
her
and
listen
to
her
as
if
she
had
come
from
a
far
off
shore
inhabited
by
a
race
different
from
our
own
.
  
<EOS>
But
for
that
very
reason
he
made
his
visit
brief
with
his
usual
activity
of
imagination
as
to
how
his
conduct
might
affect
others
,
he
shrank
from
what
might
seem
like
curiosity
or
the
assumption
of
a
right
to
know
as
much
as
he
pleased
of
one
to
whom
he
had
done
a
service
.
<EOS>
For
example
,
he
would
have
liked
to
hear
her
sing
,
but
he
would
have
felt
the
expression
of
such
a
wish
to
be
rudeness
in
him
 
since
she
could
not
refuse
,
and
he
would
all
the
while
have
a
sense
that
she
was
being
treated
like
one
whose
accomplishments
were
to
be
ready
on
demand
.
<EOS>
And
whatever
reverence
could
be
shown
to
woman
,
he
was
bent
on
showing
to
this
girl
.
<EOS>
Why
?
<EOS>
He
gave
himself
several
good
reasons
;
but
whatever
one
does
with
a
strong
unhesitating
outflow
of
will
has
a
store
of
motive
that
it
would
be
hard
to
put
into
words
.
<EOS>
Some
deeds
seem
little
more
than
interjections
which
give
vent
to
the
long
passion
of
a
life
.
  
<EOS>
So
Deronda
soon
took
his
farewell
for
the
two
months
during
which
he
expected
to
be
absent
from
London
,
and
in
a
few
days
he
was
on
his
way
with
Sir
Hugo
and
Lady
Mallinger
to
Leubronn
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
fulfilled
his
intention
of
telling
them
about
Mirah
.
<EOS>
The
baronet
was
decidedly
of
opinion
that
the
search
for
the
mother
and
brother
had
better
be
let
alone
.
<EOS>
Lady
Mallinger
was
much
interested
in
the
poor
girl
,
observing
that
there
was
a
society
for
the
conversion
of
the
Jews
,
and
that
it
was
to
be
hoped
Mirah
would
embrace
Christianity
;
but
perceiving
that
Sir
Hugo
looked
at
her
with
amusement
,
she
concluded
that
she
had
said
something
foolish
.
<EOS>
Lady
Mallinger
felt
apologetically
about
herself
as
a
woman
who
had
produced
nothing
but
daughters
in
a
case
where
sons
were
required
,
and
hence
regarded
the
apparent
contradictions
of
the
world
as
probably
due
to
the
weakness
of
her
own
understanding
.
<EOS>
But
when
she
was
much
puzzled
,
it
was
her
habit
to
say
to
herself
,
"
I
will
ask
Daniel
.
<EOS>
"
Deronda
was
altogether
a
convenience
in
the
family
;
and
Sir
Hugo
too
,
after
intending
to
do
the
best
for
him
,
had
begun
to
feel
that
the
pleasantest
result
would
be
to
have
this
substitute
for
a
son
always
ready
at
his
elbow
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
the
history
of
Deronda
,
so
far
as
he
knew
it
,
up
to
the
time
of
that
visit
to
Leubronn
in
which
he
saw
Gwendolen
Harleth
at
the
gaming
-
table
.
        
<EOS>
It
is
a
common
sentence
that
Knowledge
is
power
;
but
who
hath
duly
    
Considered
or
set
forth
the
power
of
Ignorance
?
<EOS>
Knowledge
slowly
    
builds
up
what
Ignorance
in
an
hour
pulls
down
.
<EOS>
Knowledge
,
through
    
patient
and
frugal
centuries
,
enlarges
discovery
and
makes
record
of
    
it
;
Ignorance
,
wanting
its
day
's
dinner
,
lights
a
fire
with
the
    
record
,
and
gives
a
flavor
to
its
one
roast
with
the
burned
souls
of
    
many
generations
.
<EOS>
Knowledge
,
instructing
the
sense
,
refining
and
    
multiplying
needs
,
transforms
itself
into
skill
and
makes
life
various
    
with
a
new
six
days
'
work
;
comes
Ignorance
drunk
on
the
seventh
,
with
    
a
firkin
of
oil
and
a
match
and
an
easy
"
Let
there
not
be
,
"
and
the
    
many
-
colored
creation
is
shriveled
up
in
blackness
.
<EOS>
Of
a
truth
,
    
Knowledge
is
power
,
but
it
is
a
power
reined
by
scruple
,
having
a
    
conscience
of
what
must
be
and
what
may
be
;
whereas
Ignorance
is
a
    
blind
giant
who
,
let
him
but
wax
unbound
,
would
make
it
a
sport
to
    
seize
the
pillars
that
hold
up
the
long
-
wrought
fabric
of
human
good
,
    
and
turn
all
the
places
of
joy
dark
as
a
buried
Babylon
.
<EOS>
And
looking
    
at
life
parcel
-
wise
,
in
the
growth
of
a
single
lot
,
who
having
a
    
practiced
vision
may
not
see
that
ignorance
of
the
true
bond
between
    
events
,
and
false
conceit
of
means
whereby
sequences
may
be
compelled
      
like
that
falsity
of
eyesight
which
overlooks
the
gradations
of
    
distance
,
seeing
that
which
is
afar
off
as
if
it
were
within
a
step
or
    
<EOS>
a
grasp
 
precipitates
the
mistaken
soul
on
destruction
?
   
<EOS>
It
was
half
-
past
ten
in
the
morning
when
Gwendolen
Harleth
,
after
her
gloomy
journey
from
Leubronn
,
arrived
at
the
station
from
which
she
must
drive
to
Offendene
.
<EOS>
No
carriage
or
friend
was
awaiting
her
,
for
in
the
telegram
she
had
sent
from
Dover
<EOS>
she
had
mentioned
a
later
train
,
and
in
her
impatience
of
lingering
at
a
London
station
she
had
set
off
without
picturing
what
it
would
be
to
arrive
unannounced
at
half
an
hour
's
drive
from
home
 
at
one
of
those
stations
which
have
been
fixed
on
not
as
near
anywhere
,
but
as
equidistant
from
everywhere
.
<EOS>
Deposited
as
a
_
femme
sole
_
with
her
large
trunks
,
and
having
to
wait
while
a
vehicle
was
being
got
from
the
large
-
sized
lantern
called
the
Railway
Inn
,
Gwendolen
felt
that
the
dirty
paint
in
the
waiting
-
room
,
the
dusty
decanter
of
flat
water
,
and
the
texts
in
large
letters
calling
on
her
to
repent
and
be
converted
,
were
part
of
the
dreary
prospect
opened
by
her
family
troubles
;
and
she
hurried
away
to
the
outer
door
looking
toward
the
lane
and
fields
.
<EOS>
But
here
the
very
gleams
of
sunshine
seemed
melancholy
,
for
the
autumnal
leaves
and
grass
were
shivering
,
and
the
wind
was
turning
up
the
feathers
of
a
cock
and
two
croaking
hens
which
had
doubtless
parted
with
their
grown
-
up
offspring
and
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
themselves
.
<EOS>
The
railway
official
also
seemed
without
resources
,
and
his
innocent
demeanor
in
observing
Gwendolen
and
her
trunks
was
rendered
intolerable
by
the
cast
in
his
eye
;
especially
since
,
being
a
new
man
,
he
did
not
know
her
,
and
must
conclude
that
she
was
not
very
high
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
The
vehicle
 
a
dirty
old
barouche
 
was
within
sight
,
and
was
being
slowly
prepared
by
an
elderly
laborer
.
<EOS>
Contemptible
details
these
,
to
make
part
of
a
history
;
yet
the
turn
of
most
lives
is
hardly
to
be
accounted
for
without
them
.
<EOS>
They
are
continually
entering
with
cumulative
force
into
a
mood
until
it
gets
the
mass
and
momentum
of
a
theory
or
a
motive
.
<EOS>
Even
philosophy
is
not
quite
free
from
such
determining
influences
;
and
to
be
dropped
solitary
at
an
ugly
,
irrelevant
-
looking
spot
,
with
a
sense
of
no
income
on
the
mind
,
might
well
prompt
a
man
to
discouraging
speculation
on
the
origin
of
things
and
the
reason
of
a
world
where
a
subtle
thinker
found
himself
so
badly
off
.
<EOS>
How
much
more
might
such
trifles
tell
on
a
young
lady
equipped
for
society
with
a
fastidious
taste
,
an
Indian
shawl
over
her
arm
,
some
twenty
cubic
feet
of
trunks
by
her
side
,
and
a
mortal
dislike
to
the
new
consciousness
of
poverty
which
was
stimulating
her
imagination
of
disagreeables
?
<EOS>
At
any
rate
they
told
heavily
on
poor
Gwendolen
,
and
helped
to
quell
her
resistant
spirit
.
<EOS>
What
was
the
good
of
living
in
the
midst
of
hardships
,
ugliness
,
and
humiliation
?
<EOS>
This
was
the
beginning
of
being
at
home
again
,
and
it
was
a
sample
of
what
she
had
to
expect
.
  
<EOS>
Here
was
the
theme
on
which
her
discontent
rung
its
sad
changes
during
her
slow
drive
in
the
uneasy
barouche
,
with
one
great
trunk
squeezing
the
meek
driver
,
and
the
other
fastened
with
a
rope
on
the
seat
in
front
of
her
.
<EOS>
Her
ruling
vision
all
the
way
from
Leubronn
had
been
that
the
family
would
go
abroad
again
;
for
of
course
there
must
be
some
little
income
left
 
her
mamma
did
not
mean
that
they
would
have
literally
nothing
.
<EOS>
To
go
to
a
dull
place
abroad
and
live
poorly
,
was
the
dismal
future
that
threatened
her
:
she
had
seen
plenty
of
poor
English
people
abroad
and
imagined
herself
plunged
in
the
despised
dullness
of
their
ill
-
plenished
lives
,
with
Alice
,
Bertha
,
Fanny
and
Isabel
all
growing
up
in
tediousness
around
her
,
while
she
advanced
toward
thirty
and
her
mamma
got
more
and
more
melancholy
.
<EOS>
But
she
did
not
mean
to
submit
,
and
let
misfortune
do
what
it
would
with
her
:
she
had
not
yet
quite
believed
in
the
misfortune
;
but
weariness
and
disgust
with
this
wretched
arrival
had
begun
to
affect
her
like
an
uncomfortable
waking
,
worse
than
the
uneasy
dreams
which
had
gone
before
.
<EOS>
The
self
-
delight
with
which
she
had
kissed
her
image
in
the
glass
had
faded
before
the
sense
of
futility
in
being
anything
whatever
 
charming
,
clever
,
resolute
 
<EOS>
what
was
the
good
of
it
all
?
<EOS>
Events
might
turn
out
anyhow
,
and
men
were
hateful
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
men
were
hateful
.
<EOS>
But
in
these
last
hours
,
a
certain
change
had
come
over
their
meaning
.
<EOS>
It
is
one
thing
to
hate
stolen
goods
,
and
another
thing
to
hate
them
the
more
because
their
being
stolen
hinders
us
from
making
use
of
them
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
had
begun
to
be
angry
with
Grandcourt
for
being
what
had
hindered
her
from
marrying
him
,
angry
with
him
as
the
cause
of
her
present
dreary
lot
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
slow
drive
was
nearly
at
an
end
,
and
the
lumbering
vehicle
coming
up
the
avenue
was
within
sight
of
the
windows
.
<EOS>
A
figure
appearing
under
the
portico
brought
a
rush
of
new
and
less
selfish
feeling
in
Gwendolen
,
and
when
springing
from
the
carriage
she
saw
the
dear
beautiful
face
with
fresh
lines
of
sadness
in
it
<EOS>
,
she
threw
her
arms
round
her
mother
's
neck
,
and
for
the
moment
felt
all
sorrows
only
in
relation
to
her
mother
's
feeling
about
them
.
  
<EOS>
Behind
,
of
course
,
were
the
sad
faces
of
the
four
superfluous
girls
,
each
,
poor
thing
 
like
those
other
many
thousand
sisters
of
us
all
 
having
her
peculiar
world
which
was
of
no
importance
to
any
one
else
,
but
all
of
them
feeling
Gwendolen
's
presence
to
be
somehow
a
relenting
of
misfortune
:
where
Gwendolen
was
,
something
interesting
would
happen
;
even
her
hurried
submission
to
their
kisses
,
and
"
Now
go
away
,
girls
,
"
carried
the
sort
of
comfort
which
all
weakness
finds
in
decision
and
authoritativeness
.
<EOS>
Good
Miss
Merry
,
whose
air
of
meek
depression
,
hitherto
held
unaccountable
in
a
governess
affectionately
attached
to
the
family
,
was
now
at
the
general
level
of
circumstances
,
did
not
expect
any
greeting
,
but
busied
herself
with
the
trunks
and
the
coachman
's
pay
;
while
Mrs.
Davilow
and
Gwendolen
hastened
up
-
stairs
and
shut
themselves
in
the
black
and
yellow
bedroom
.
  
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
,
mamma
dear
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
tenderly
pressing
her
handkerchief
against
the
tears
that
were
rolling
down
Mrs.
Davilow
's
cheeks
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Never
mind
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mind
.
<EOS>
I
will
do
something
.
<EOS>
I
will
be
something
.
<EOS>
Things
will
come
right
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
worse
because
I
was
away
.
<EOS>
Come
now
!
<EOS>
you
must
be
glad
because
I
am
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
felt
every
word
of
that
speech
.
<EOS>
A
rush
of
compassionate
tenderness
stirred
all
her
capability
of
generous
resolution
;
and
the
self
-
confident
projects
which
had
vaguely
glanced
before
her
during
her
journey
sprang
instantaneously
into
new
definiteness
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
she
seemed
to
perceive
how
she
could
be
"
something
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
one
of
her
best
moments
,
and
the
fond
mother
,
forgetting
everything
below
that
tide
mark
,
looked
at
her
with
a
sort
of
adoration
.
<EOS>
She
said
    
"
Bless
you
,
my
good
,
good
darling
!
<EOS>
I
can
be
happy
,
if
you
can
!
"
  
<EOS>
But
later
in
the
day
there
was
an
ebb
;
the
old
slippery
rocks
,
the
old
weedy
places
reappeared
.
<EOS>
Naturally
,
there
was
a
shrinking
of
courage
as
misfortune
ceased
to
be
a
mere
announcement
,
and
began
to
disclose
itself
as
a
grievous
tyrannical
inmate
.
<EOS>
At
first
 
that
ugly
drive
at
an
end
 
<EOS>
it
was
still
Offendene
that
Gwendolen
had
come
home
to
,
and
all
surroundings
of
immediate
consequence
to
her
were
still
there
to
secure
her
personal
ease
;
the
roomy
stillness
of
the
large
solid
house
while
she
rested
;
all
the
luxuries
of
her
toilet
cared
for
without
trouble
to
her
;
and
a
little
tray
with
her
favorite
food
brought
to
her
in
private
.
<EOS>
For
she
had
said
,
"
Keep
them
all
away
from
us
to
-
day
,
mamma
.
<EOS>
Let
you
and
me
be
alone
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
Gwendolen
came
down
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
fresh
as
a
newly
-
dipped
swan
,
and
sat
leaning
against
the
cushions
of
the
settee
beside
her
mamma
,
their
misfortune
had
not
yet
turned
its
face
and
breath
upon
her
.
<EOS>
She
felt
prepared
to
hear
everything
,
and
began
in
a
tone
of
deliberate
intention
    
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
thought
of
doing
,
exactly
,
mamma
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
dear
,
the
next
thing
to
be
done
is
to
move
away
from
this
house
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Haynes
most
fortunately
is
as
glad
to
have
it
now
as
he
would
have
been
when
we
took
it
.
<EOS>
Lord
Brackenshaw
's
agent
is
to
arrange
everything
with
him
to
the
best
advantage
for
us
:
Bazley
,
you
know
;
not
at
all
an
ill
-
natured
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
help
thinking
that
Lord
Brackenshaw
would
let
you
stay
here
rent
-
free
,
mamma
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
whose
talents
had
not
been
applied
to
business
so
much
as
to
discernment
of
the
admiration
excited
by
her
charms
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
child
,
Lord
Brackenshaw
is
in
Scotland
,
and
knows
nothing
about
us
.
<EOS>
Neither
your
uncle
nor
I
would
choose
to
apply
to
him
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
what
could
we
do
in
this
house
without
servants
,
and
without
money
to
warm
it
?
<EOS>
The
sooner
we
are
out
the
better
.
<EOS>
We
have
nothing
to
carry
but
our
clothes
,
you
know
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
mean
to
go
abroad
,
then
?
"
said
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
this
is
what
she
had
familiarized
her
mind
with
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
dear
,
no
.
<EOS>
How
could
we
travel
?
<EOS>
You
never
did
learn
anything
about
income
and
expenses
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
trying
to
smile
,
and
putting
her
hand
on
Gwendolen
's
as
she
added
,
mournfully
,
"
that
makes
it
so
much
harder
for
you
,
my
pet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
where
are
we
to
go
?
"
said
Gwendolen
,
with
a
trace
of
sharpness
in
her
tone
.
<EOS>
She
felt
a
new
current
of
fear
passing
through
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
all
decided
.
<EOS>
A
little
furniture
is
to
be
got
in
from
the
rectory
 
all
that
can
be
spared
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
hesitated
.
<EOS>
She
dreaded
the
reality
for
herself
less
than
the
shock
she
must
give
to
Gwendolen
,
who
looked
at
her
with
tense
expectancy
,
but
was
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
Sawyer
's
Cottage
we
are
to
go
to
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
first
,
Gwendolen
remained
silent
,
paling
with
anger
 
justifiable
anger
,
in
her
opinion
.
<EOS>
Then
she
said
with
haughtiness
    
<EOS>
"
That
is
impossible
.
<EOS>
Something
else
than
that
ought
to
have
been
thought
of
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
ought
not
to
allow
that
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
submit
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
sweet
child
,
what
else
could
have
been
thought
of
?
<EOS>
Your
uncle
,
I
am
sure
,
is
as
kind
as
he
can
be
:
but
he
is
suffering
himself
;
he
has
his
family
to
bring
up
.
<EOS>
And
do
you
quite
understand
?
<EOS>
You
must
remember
 
we
have
nothing
.
<EOS>
We
shall
have
absolutely
nothing
except
what
he
and
my
sister
give
us
.
<EOS>
They
have
been
as
wise
and
active
a
possible
,
and
we
must
try
to
earn
something
.
<EOS>
I
and
the
girls
are
going
to
work
a
table
-
cloth
border
for
the
Ladies
'
Charity
at
Winchester
,
and
a
communion
cloth
that
the
parishioners
are
to
present
to
Pennicote
Church
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
went
into
these
details
timidly
:
but
how
else
was
she
to
bring
the
fact
of
their
position
home
to
this
poor
child
who
,
alas
!
<EOS>
must
submit
at
present
,
whatever
might
be
in
the
background
for
her
?
<EOS>
and
she
herself
had
a
superstition
that
there
must
be
something
better
in
the
background
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
surely
somewhere
else
than
Sawyer
's
Cottage
might
have
been
found
,
"
Gwendolen
persisted
 
taken
hold
of
(
as
if
in
a
nightmare
)
by
the
image
of
this
house
where
an
exciseman
had
lived
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
,
dear
.
<EOS>
You
know
houses
are
scarce
,
and
we
may
be
thankful
to
get
anything
so
private
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
so
very
bad
.
<EOS>
There
are
two
little
parlors
and
four
bedrooms
.
<EOS>
You
shall
sit
alone
whenever
you
like
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
ebb
of
sympathetic
care
for
her
mamma
had
gone
so
low
just
now
,
that
Gwendolen
took
no
notice
of
these
deprecatory
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
conceive
that
all
your
property
is
gone
at
once
,
mamma
.
<EOS>
How
can
you
be
sure
in
so
short
a
time
?
<EOS>
It
is
not
a
week
since
you
wrote
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
first
news
came
much
earlier
,
dear
.
<EOS>
But
I
would
not
spoil
your
pleasure
till
it
was
quite
necessary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
how
vexatious
!
"
said
Gwendolen
,
coloring
with
fresh
anger
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
known
,
I
could
have
brought
home
the
money
I
had
won
:
and
for
want
of
knowing
,
I
stayed
and
lost
it
.
<EOS>
I
had
nearly
two
hundred
pounds
,
and
it
would
have
done
for
us
to
live
on
a
little
while
,
till
I
could
carry
out
some
plan
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
paused
an
instant
and
then
added
more
impetuously
,
"
Everything
has
gone
against
me
.
<EOS>
People
have
come
near
me
only
to
blight
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Among
the
"
people
"
she
was
including
Deronda
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
not
interfered
in
her
life
she
would
have
gone
to
the
gaming
-
table
again
with
a
few
napoleons
,
and
might
have
won
back
her
losses
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
resign
ourselves
to
the
will
of
Providence
,
my
child
,
"
said
poor
Mrs.
Davilow
,
startled
by
this
revelation
of
the
gambling
,
but
not
daring
to
say
more
.
<EOS>
She
felt
sure
that
"
people
"
meant
Grandcourt
,
about
whom
her
lips
were
sealed
.
<EOS>
And
Gwendolen
answered
immediately
    
"
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
resign
myself
.
<EOS>
I
shall
do
what
I
can
against
it
.
<EOS>
What
is
the
good
of
calling
the
people
's
wickedness
Providence
?
<EOS>
You
said
in
your
letter
it
was
Mr.
Lassman
's
fault
we
had
lost
our
money
.
<EOS>
Has
he
run
away
with
it
all
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
<EOS>
dear
,
you
do
n't
understand
.
<EOS>
There
were
great
speculations
:
he
meant
to
gain
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
about
mines
and
things
of
that
sort
.
<EOS>
He
risked
too
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
call
that
Providence
:
it
was
his
improvidence
with
our
money
,
and
he
ought
to
be
punished
.
<EOS>
Ca
n't
we
go
to
law
and
recover
our
fortune
?
<EOS>
My
uncle
ought
to
take
measures
,
and
not
sit
down
by
such
wrongs
.
<EOS>
We
ought
to
go
to
law
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
child
,
law
can
never
bring
back
money
lost
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
Your
uncle
says
it
is
milk
spilled
upon
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
one
must
have
a
fortune
to
get
any
law
:
there
is
no
law
for
people
who
are
ruined
.
<EOS>
And
our
money
has
only
gone
along
with
other
's
people
's
.
<EOS>
We
are
not
the
only
sufferers
:
others
have
to
resign
themselves
besides
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
n't
resign
myself
to
live
at
Sawyer
's
Cottage
and
see
you
working
for
sixpences
and
shillings
because
of
that
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
do
it
.
<EOS>
I
shall
do
what
is
more
befitting
our
rank
and
education
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
your
uncle
and
all
of
us
will
approve
of
that
,
dear
,
and
admire
you
the
more
for
it
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
glad
of
an
unexpected
opening
for
speaking
on
a
difficult
subject
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
mean
that
you
should
resign
yourself
to
worse
when
anything
better
offered
itself
.
<EOS>
Both
your
uncle
and
aunt
have
felt
that
your
abilities
and
education
were
a
fortune
for
you
,
and
they
have
already
heard
of
something
within
your
reach
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
that
,
mamma
?
"
<EOS>
some
of
Gwendolen
's
anger
gave
way
to
interest
,
and
she
was
not
without
romantic
conjectures
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
are
two
situations
that
offer
themselves
.
<EOS>
One
is
in
a
bishop
's
family
,
where
there
are
three
daughters
,
and
the
other
is
in
quite
a
high
class
of
school
;
and
in
both
,
your
French
,
and
music
,
and
dancing
 
and
then
your
manners
and
habits
as
a
lady
,
are
exactly
what
is
wanted
.
<EOS>
Each
is
a
hundred
a
year
 
and
 
just
for
the
present
,
"
 
Mrs.
Davilow
had
become
frightened
and
hesitating
,
 
"
to
save
you
from
the
petty
,
common
way
of
living
that
we
must
go
to
 
<EOS>
you
would
perhaps
accept
one
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
be
like
Miss
Graves
at
Madame
Meunier
<EOS>
's
?
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
myself
,
that
Dr.
Monpert
's
would
be
more
suitable
.
<EOS>
There
could
be
no
hardship
in
a
bishop
's
family
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Excuse
me
,
mamma
.
<EOS>
There
are
hardships
everywhere
for
a
governess
.
<EOS>
And
I
do
n't
see
that
it
would
be
pleasanter
to
be
looked
down
on
in
a
bishop
's
family
than
in
any
other
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
you
know
very
well
I
hate
teaching
.
<EOS>
Fancy
me
shut
up
with
three
awkward
girls
something
like
Alice
!
<EOS>
I
would
rather
emigrate
than
be
a
governess
.
"
  
<EOS>
What
it
precisely
was
to
emigrate
,
Gwendolen
was
not
called
on
to
explain
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
was
mute
,
seeing
no
outlet
,
and
thinking
with
dread
of
the
collision
that
might
happen
when
Gwendolen
had
to
meet
her
uncle
and
aunt
.
<EOS>
There
was
an
air
of
reticence
in
Gwendolen
's
haughty
,
resistant
speeches
which
implied
that
she
had
a
definite
plan
in
reserve
;
and
her
practical
ignorance
continually
exhibited
,
could
not
nullify
the
mother
's
belief
in
the
effectiveness
of
that
forcible
will
and
daring
which
had
held
mastery
over
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
some
ornaments
,
mamma
,
and
I
could
sell
them
,
"
said
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
They
would
make
a
sum
:
I
want
a
little
sum
 
just
to
go
on
with
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
Marshall
,
at
Wanchester
,
would
take
them
:
<EOS>
I
know
he
showed
me
some
bracelets
once
that
he
said
he
had
bought
from
a
lady
.
<EOS>
Jocosa
might
go
and
ask
him
.
<EOS>
Jocosa
is
going
to
leave
us
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
But
she
might
do
that
first
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
would
do
anything
she
could
,
poor
,
dear
soul
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
told
you
yet
 
<EOS>
she
wanted
me
to
take
all
her
savings
 
<EOS>
her
three
hundred
pounds
.
<EOS>
I
tell
her
to
set
up
a
little
school
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
hard
for
her
to
go
into
a
new
family
<EOS>
now
she
has
been
so
long
with
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
recommend
her
for
the
bishop
's
daughter
's
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
with
a
sudden
gleam
of
laughter
in
her
face
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
she
will
do
better
than
I
should
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
take
care
not
to
say
such
things
to
your
uncle
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
.
<EOS>
"
He
will
be
hurt
at
your
despising
what
he
has
exerted
himself
about
.
<EOS>
But
I
dare
say
you
have
something
else
in
your
mind
that
he
might
not
disapprove
,
if
you
consulted
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
some
one
else
I
want
to
consult
first
.
<EOS>
Are
the
Arrowpoint
's
at
Quetcham
still
,
and
is
Herr
Klesmer
there
?
<EOS>
But
I
daresay
you
know
nothing
about
it
,
poor
,
dear
mamma
.
<EOS>
Can
Jeffries
go
on
horseback
with
a
note
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
dear
,
Jefferies
is
not
here
,
and
the
dealer
has
taken
the
horses
.
<EOS>
But
some
one
could
go
for
us
from
Leek
's
farm
.
<EOS>
The
Arrowpoints
are
at
Quetcham
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
Miss
Arrowpoint
left
her
card
the
other
day
:
I
could
not
see
her
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
know
about
Herr
Klesmer
.
<EOS>
Do
you
want
to
send
before
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
I
will
write
a
note
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
rising
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
can
you
be
thinking
of
,
Gwen
?
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
relieved
in
the
midst
of
her
wonderment
by
signs
of
alacrity
and
better
humor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
mind
what
,
there
's
a
dear
,
good
mamma
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
reseating
herself
a
moment
to
give
atoning
caresses
.
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
do
something
.
<EOS>
Never
mind
what
until
it
is
all
settled
.
<EOS>
And
then
you
shall
be
comforted
.
<EOS>
The
dear
face
!
 
<EOS>
it
is
ten
years
older
in
these
three
weeks
.
<EOS>
Now
,
now
,
now
!
do
n't
cry
"
 
Gwendolen
,
holding
her
mamma
's
head
with
both
hands
,
kissed
the
trembling
eyelids
.
"
<EOS>
But
mind
you
do
n't
contradict
me
or
put
hindrances
in
my
way
.
<EOS>
I
must
decide
for
myself
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
be
dictated
to
by
my
uncle
or
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
My
life
is
my
own
affair
.
<EOS>
And
I
think
"
 
here
her
tone
took
an
edge
of
scorn
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
can
do
better
for
you
than
let
you
live
in
Sawyer
's
Cottage
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
uttering
this
last
sentence
Gwendolen
again
rose
,
and
went
to
a
desk
where
she
wrote
the
following
note
to
Klesmer
:
        
<EOS>
Miss
Harleth
presents
her
compliments
to
Herr
Klesmer
,
and
ventures
    
to
request
of
him
the
very
great
favor
that
he
will
call
upon
her
,
if
    
possible
,
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Her
reason
for
presuming
so
far
on
his
kindness
    
is
of
a
very
serious
nature
.
<EOS>
Unfortunate
family
circumstances
have
    
obliged
her
to
take
a
course
in
which
she
can
only
turn
for
advice
to
    
the
great
knowledge
and
judgment
of
Herr
Klesmer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
get
this
sent
to
Quetcham
at
once
,
mamma
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
as
she
addressed
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
The
man
must
be
told
to
wait
for
an
answer
.
<EOS>
Let
no
time
be
lost
.
"
  
<EOS>
For
the
moment
,
the
absorbing
purpose
was
to
get
the
letter
dispatched
;
but
when
she
had
been
assured
on
this
point
,
another
anxiety
arose
and
kept
her
in
a
state
of
uneasy
excitement
.
<EOS>
If
Klesmer
happened
not
to
be
at
Quetcham
,
what
could
she
do
next
?
<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
belief
in
her
star
,
so
to
speak
,
had
had
some
bruises
.
<EOS>
Things
had
gone
against
her
.
<EOS>
A
splendid
marriage
which
presented
itself
within
reach
had
shown
a
hideous
flaw
.
<EOS>
The
chances
of
roulette
had
not
adjusted
themselves
to
her
claims
;
and
a
man
of
whom
she
knew
nothing
had
thrust
himself
between
her
and
her
intentions
.
<EOS>
The
conduct
of
those
uninteresting
people
who
managed
the
business
of
the
world
had
been
culpable
just
in
the
points
most
injurious
to
her
in
particular
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
Harleth
,
with
all
her
beauty
and
conscious
force
,
felt
the
close
threats
of
humiliation
:
for
the
first
time
the
conditions
of
this
world
seemed
to
her
like
a
hurrying
roaring
crowd
in
which
she
had
got
astray
,
no
more
cared
for
and
protected
than
a
myriad
of
other
girls
,
in
spite
of
its
being
a
peculiar
hardship
to
her
.
<EOS>
If
Klesmer
were
not
at
Quetcham
 
that
would
be
all
of
a
piece
with
the
rest
:
the
unwelcome
negative
urged
itself
as
a
probability
,
and
set
her
brain
working
at
desperate
alternatives
which
might
deliver
her
from
Sawyer
's
Cottage
or
the
ultimate
necessity
of
"
taking
a
situation
,
"
a
phrase
that
summed
up
for
her
the
disagreeables
most
wounding
to
her
pride
,
most
irksome
to
her
tastes
;
at
least
so
far
as
her
experience
enabled
her
to
imagine
disagreeables
.
  
<EOS>
Still
Klesmer
might
be
there
,
and
Gwendolen
thought
of
the
result
in
that
case
with
a
hopefulness
which
even
cast
a
satisfactory
light
over
her
peculiar
troubles
,
as
what
might
well
enter
into
the
biography
of
celebrities
and
remarkable
persons
.
<EOS>
And
if
she
had
heard
her
immediate
acquaintances
cross
-
examined
as
to
whether
they
thought
her
remarkable
,
the
first
who
said
"
No
"
would
have
surprised
her
.
      
<EOS>
We
please
our
fancy
with
ideal
webs
  
<EOS>
Of
innovation
,
but
our
life
meanwhile
  
Is
in
the
loom
,
where
busy
passion
plies
  
The
shuttle
to
and
fro
,
and
gives
our
deeds
  
The
accustomed
pattern
.
   
<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
note
,
coming
"
pat
betwixt
too
early
and
too
late
,
"
was
put
into
Klesmer
's
hands
just
when
he
was
leaving
Quetcham
,
and
in
order
to
meet
her
appeal
to
his
kindness
he
,
with
some
inconvenience
to
himself
spent
the
night
at
Wanchester
.
<EOS>
There
were
reasons
why
he
would
not
remain
at
Quetcham
.
  
<EOS>
That
magnificent
mansion
,
fitted
with
regard
to
the
greatest
expense
,
had
in
fact
became
too
hot
for
him
,
its
owners
having
,
like
some
great
politicians
,
been
astonished
at
an
insurrection
against
the
established
order
of
things
,
which
we
plain
people
after
the
event
can
perceive
to
have
been
prepared
under
their
very
noses
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
as
usual
many
guests
in
the
house
,
and
among
them
one
in
whom
Miss
Arrowpoint
foresaw
a
new
pretender
to
her
hand
:
a
political
man
of
good
family
who
confidently
expected
a
peerage
,
and
felt
on
public
grounds
that
he
required
a
larger
fortune
to
support
the
title
properly
.
<EOS>
Heiresses
vary
,
and
persons
interested
in
one
of
them
beforehand
are
prepared
to
find
that
she
is
too
yellow
or
too
red
,
tall
and
toppling
or
short
and
square
,
violent
and
capricious
or
moony
and
insipid
;
but
in
every
case
it
is
taken
for
granted
that
she
will
consider
herself
an
appendage
to
her
fortune
,
and
marry
where
others
think
her
fortunes
ought
to
go
.
<EOS>
Nature
,
however
,
not
only
accommodates
herself
ill
to
our
favorite
practices
by
making
"
only
children
"
daughters
,
but
also
now
and
then
endows
the
misplaced
daughter
with
a
clear
head
and
a
strong
will
.
<EOS>
The
Arrowpoints
had
already
felt
some
anxiety
owing
to
these
endowments
of
their
Catherine
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
accept
the
view
of
her
social
duty
which
required
her
to
marry
a
needy
nobleman
or
a
commoner
on
the
ladder
toward
nobility
;
and
they
were
not
without
uneasiness
concerning
her
persistence
in
declining
suitable
offers
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
possibility
of
her
being
in
love
with
Klesmer
they
were
not
at
all
uneasy
 
a
very
common
sort
of
blindness
.
<EOS>
For
in
general
mortals
have
a
great
power
of
being
astonished
at
the
presence
of
an
effect
toward
which
they
have
done
everything
,
and
at
the
absence
of
an
effect
toward
which
they
had
done
nothing
but
desire
it
.
<EOS>
Parents
are
astonished
at
the
ignorance
of
their
sons
,
though
they
have
used
the
most
time
-
honored
and
expensive
means
of
securing
it
;
husbands
and
wives
are
mutually
astonished
at
the
loss
of
affection
which
they
have
taken
no
pains
to
keep
;
and
all
of
us
in
our
turn
are
apt
to
be
astonished
that
our
neighbors
do
not
admire
us
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
it
happens
that
the
truth
seems
highly
improbable
.
<EOS>
The
truth
is
something
different
from
the
habitual
lazy
combinations
begotten
by
our
wishes
.
<EOS>
The
Arrowpoints
'
hour
of
astonishment
was
come
.
  
<EOS>
When
there
is
a
passion
between
an
heiress
and
a
proud
independent
-
spirited
man
,
it
is
difficult
for
them
to
come
to
an
understanding
;
but
the
difficulties
are
likely
to
be
overcome
unless
the
proud
man
secures
himself
by
a
constant
_
alibi
_
.
<EOS>
Brief
meetings
after
studied
absence
are
potent
in
disclosure
:
but
more
potent
still
is
frequent
companionship
,
with
full
sympathy
in
taste
and
admirable
qualities
on
both
sides
;
especially
where
the
one
is
in
the
position
of
teacher
and
the
other
is
delightedly
conscious
of
receptive
ability
which
also
gives
the
teacher
delight
.
<EOS>
The
situation
is
famous
in
history
,
and
has
no
less
charm
now
than
it
had
in
the
days
of
Abelard
.
  
<EOS>
But
this
kind
of
comparison
had
not
occurred
to
the
Arrowpoints
when
they
first
engaged
Klesmer
to
come
down
to
Quetcham
.
<EOS>
To
have
a
first
-
rate
musician
in
your
house
is
a
privilege
of
wealth
;
Catherine
's
musical
talent
demanded
every
advantage
;
and
she
particularly
desired
to
use
her
quieter
time
in
the
country
for
more
thorough
study
.
<EOS>
Klesmer
was
not
yet
a
Liszt
,
understood
to
be
adored
by
ladies
of
all
European
countries
with
the
exception
of
Lapland
:
and
even
with
that
understanding
it
did
not
follow
that
he
would
make
proposals
to
an
heiress
.
<EOS>
No
musician
of
honor
would
do
so
.
<EOS>
Still
less
was
it
conceivable
that
Catherine
would
give
him
the
slightest
pretext
for
such
daring
.
<EOS>
The
large
check
that
Mr.
Arrowpoint
was
to
draw
in
Klesmer
's
name
seemed
to
make
him
as
safe
an
inmate
as
a
footman
.
<EOS>
Where
marriage
is
inconceivable
,
a
girl
's
sentiments
are
safe
.
  
<EOS>
Klesmer
was
eminently
a
man
of
honor
,
but
marriages
rarely
begin
with
formal
proposals
,
and
moreover
,
Catherine
's
limit
of
the
conceivable
did
not
exactly
correspond
with
her
mother
's
.
  
<EOS>
Outsiders
might
have
been
more
apt
to
think
that
Klesmer
's
position
was
dangerous
for
himself
if
Miss
Arrowpoint
had
been
an
acknowledged
beauty
;
not
taking
into
account
that
the
most
powerful
of
all
beauty
is
that
which
reveals
itself
after
sympathy
and
not
before
it
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
charm
of
eye
and
lip
which
comes
with
every
little
phrase
that
certifies
delicate
perception
or
fine
judgment
,
with
every
unostentatious
word
or
smile
that
shows
a
heart
awake
to
others
;
and
no
sweep
of
garment
or
turn
of
figure
is
more
satisfying
than
that
which
enters
as
a
restoration
of
confidence
that
one
person
is
present
on
whom
no
intention
will
be
lost
.
<EOS>
What
dignity
of
meaning
goes
on
gathering
in
frowns
and
laughs
which
are
never
observed
in
the
wrong
place
;
what
suffused
adorableness
in
a
human
frame
where
there
is
a
mind
that
can
flash
out
comprehension
and
hands
that
can
execute
finely
!
<EOS>
The
more
obvious
beauty
,
also
adorable
sometimes
 
one
may
say
it
without
blasphemy
 
begins
by
being
an
apology
for
folly
,
and
ends
like
other
apologies
in
becoming
tiresome
by
iteration
;
and
that
Klesmer
,
though
very
susceptible
to
it
,
should
have
a
passionate
attachment
to
Miss
Arrowpoint
,
was
no
more
a
paradox
than
any
other
triumph
of
a
manifold
sympathy
over
a
monotonous
attraction
.
<EOS>
We
object
less
to
be
taxed
with
the
enslaving
excess
of
our
passions
than
with
our
deficiency
in
wider
passion
;
but
if
the
truth
were
known
,
our
reputed
intensity
is
often
the
dullness
of
not
knowing
what
else
to
do
with
ourselves
.
<EOS>
Tannhäuser
,
one
suspects
,
was
a
knight
of
ill
-
furnished
imagination
,
hardly
of
larger
discourse
than
a
heavy
Guardsman
;
Merlin
had
certainly
seen
his
best
days
,
and
was
merely
repeating
himself
,
when
he
fell
into
that
hopeless
captivity
;
and
we
know
that
Ulysses
felt
so
manifest
an
_
ennui
_
under
similar
circumstances
that
Calypso
herself
furthered
his
departure
.
<EOS>
There
is
indeed
a
report
that
he
afterward
left
Penelope
;
but
since
she
was
habitually
absorbed
in
worsted
work
,
and
it
was
probably
from
her
that
Telemachus
got
his
mean
,
pettifogging
disposition
,
always
anxious
about
the
property
and
the
daily
consumption
of
meat
,
no
inference
can
be
drawn
from
this
already
dubious
scandal
as
to
the
relation
between
companionship
and
constancy
.
  
<EOS>
Klesmer
was
as
versatile
and
fascinating
as
a
young
Ulysses
on
a
sufficient
acquaintance
 
one
whom
nature
seemed
to
have
first
made
generously
and
then
to
have
added
music
as
a
dominant
power
using
all
the
abundant
rest
,
and
,
as
in
Mendelssohn
,
finding
expression
for
itself
not
only
in
the
highest
finish
of
execution
,
but
in
that
fervor
of
creative
work
and
theoretic
belief
which
pierces
devoted
purpose
.
<EOS>
His
foibles
of
arrogance
and
vanity
did
not
exceed
such
as
may
be
found
in
the
best
English
families
;
and
Catherine
Arrowpoint
had
no
corresponding
restlessness
to
clash
with
his
:
notwithstanding
her
native
kindliness
she
was
perhaps
too
coolly
firm
and
self
-
sustained
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
one
of
those
satisfactory
creatures
whose
intercourse
has
the
charm
of
discovery
;
whose
integrity
of
faculty
and
expression
begets
a
wish
to
know
what
they
will
say
on
all
subjects
or
how
they
will
perform
whatever
they
undertake
;
so
that
they
end
by
raising
not
only
a
continual
expectation
but
a
continual
sense
of
fulfillment
 
the
systole
and
diastole
of
blissful
companionship
.
<EOS>
In
such
cases
the
outward
presentment
easily
becomes
what
the
image
is
to
the
worshipper
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
long
before
the
two
became
aware
that
each
was
interesting
to
the
other
;
but
the
"
how
far
"
remained
a
matter
of
doubt
.
<EOS>
Klesmer
did
not
conceive
that
Miss
Arrowpoint
was
likely
to
think
of
him
as
a
possible
lover
,
and
she
was
not
accustomed
to
think
of
herself
as
likely
to
stir
more
than
a
friendly
regard
,
or
to
fear
the
expression
of
more
from
any
man
who
was
not
enamored
of
her
fortune
.
<EOS>
Each
was
content
to
suffer
some
unshared
sense
of
denial
for
the
sake
of
loving
the
other
's
society
a
little
too
well
;
and
under
these
conditions
no
need
had
been
felt
to
restrict
Klesmer
's
visits
for
the
last
year
either
in
country
or
in
town
.
<EOS>
He
knew
very
well
that
if
Miss
Arrowpoint
had
been
poor
he
would
have
made
ardent
love
to
her
instead
of
sending
a
storm
through
the
piano
,
or
folding
his
arms
and
pouring
out
a
hyperbolical
tirade
about
something
as
impersonal
as
the
north
pole
;
and
she
was
not
less
aware
that
if
it
had
been
possible
for
Klesmer
to
wish
for
her
hand
she
would
have
found
overmastering
reasons
for
giving
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
Here
was
the
safety
of
full
cups
,
which
are
as
secure
from
overflow
as
the
half
-
empty
,
always
supposing
no
disturbance
.
<EOS>
Naturally
,
silent
feeling
had
not
remained
at
the
same
point
any
more
than
the
stealthly
dial
-
hand
,
and
in
the
present
visit
to
Quetcham
,
Klesmer
had
begun
to
think
that
he
would
not
come
again
;
while
Catherine
was
more
sensitive
to
his
frequent
_
brusquerie
_
,
which
she
rather
resented
as
a
needless
effort
to
assert
his
footing
of
superior
in
every
sense
except
the
conventional
.
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
enters
the
expectant
peer
,
Mr.
Bult
,
an
esteemed
party
man
who
,
rather
neutral
in
private
life
,
had
strong
opinions
concerning
the
districts
of
the
Niger
,
was
much
at
home
also
in
Brazils
,
spoke
with
decision
of
affairs
in
the
South
Seas
,
was
studious
of
his
Parliamentary
and
itinerant
speeches
,
and
had
the
general
solidity
and
suffusive
pinkness
of
a
healthy
Briton
on
the
central
table
-
land
of
life
.
<EOS>
Catherine
,
aware
of
a
tacit
understanding
that
he
was
an
undeniable
husband
for
an
heiress
,
had
nothing
to
say
against
him
but
that
he
was
thoroughly
tiresome
to
her
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bult
was
amiably
confident
,
and
had
no
idea
that
his
insensibility
to
counterpoint
could
ever
be
reckoned
against
him
.
<EOS>
Klesmer
he
hardly
regarded
in
the
light
of
a
serious
human
being
who
ought
to
have
a
vote
;
and
he
did
not
mind
Miss
Arrowpoint
's
addiction
to
music
any
more
than
her
probable
expenses
in
antique
lace
.
<EOS>
He
was
consequently
a
little
amazed
at
an
after
-
dinner
outburst
of
Klesmer
's
on
the
lack
of
idealism
in
English
politics
,
which
left
all
mutuality
between
distant
races
to
be
determined
simply
by
the
need
of
a
market
;
<EOS>
the
crusades
,
to
his
mind
,
had
at
least
this
excuse
,
that
they
had
a
banner
of
sentiment
round
which
generous
feelings
could
rally
:
of
course
,
the
scoundrels
rallied
too
,
but
what
then
?
<EOS>
they
rally
in
equal
force
round
your
advertisement
van
of
"
Buy
cheap
,
sell
dear
.
<EOS>
"
On
this
theme
Klesmer
's
eloquence
,
gesticulatory
and
other
,
went
on
for
a
little
while
like
stray
fireworks
accidentally
ignited
,
and
then
sank
into
immovable
silence
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bult
was
not
surprised
that
Klesmer
's
opinions
should
be
flighty
,
but
was
astonished
at
his
command
of
English
idiom
and
his
ability
to
put
a
point
in
a
way
that
would
have
told
at
a
constituents
'
dinner
 
to
be
accounted
for
probably
by
his
being
a
Pole
,
or
a
Czech
,
or
something
of
that
fermenting
sort
,
in
a
state
of
political
refugeeism
which
had
obliged
him
to
make
a
profession
of
his
music
;
and
that
evening
in
the
drawing
-
room
he
for
the
first
time
went
up
to
Klesmer
at
the
piano
,
Miss
Arrowpoint
being
near
,
and
said
    
"
I
had
no
idea
before
that
you
were
a
political
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Klesmer
's
only
answer
was
to
fold
his
arms
,
put
out
his
nether
lip
,
and
stare
at
Mr.
Bult
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
been
used
to
public
speaking
.
<EOS>
You
speak
uncommonly
well
,
though
I
do
n't
agree
with
you
.
<EOS>
From
what
you
said
about
sentiment
,
I
fancy
you
are
a
Panslavist
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
my
name
is
Elijah
.
<EOS>
I
am
the
Wandering
Jew
,
"
said
Klesmer
,
flashing
a
smile
at
Miss
Arrowpoint
,
and
suddenly
making
a
mysterious
,
wind
-
like
rush
backward
and
forward
on
the
piano
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bult
felt
this
buffoonery
rather
offensive
and
Polish
,
but
 
Miss
Arrowpoint
being
there
 
did
not
like
to
move
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
Herr
Klesmer
has
cosmopolitan
ideas
,
"
said
Miss
Arrowpoint
,
trying
to
make
the
best
of
the
situation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
looks
forward
to
a
fusion
of
races
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
With
all
my
heart
,
"
said
Mr.
Bult
,
willing
to
be
gracious
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
sure
he
had
too
much
talent
to
be
a
mere
musician
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
sir
,
you
are
under
some
mistake
there
,
"
said
Klesmer
,
firing
up
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
man
has
too
much
talent
to
be
a
musician
.
<EOS>
Most
men
have
too
little
.
<EOS>
A
creative
artist
is
no
more
a
mere
musician
than
a
great
statesman
is
a
mere
politician
.
<EOS>
We
are
not
ingenious
puppets
,
sir
,
who
live
in
a
box
and
look
out
on
the
world
only
when
it
is
gaping
for
amusement
.
<EOS>
We
help
to
rule
the
nations
and
make
the
age
as
much
as
any
other
public
men
.
<EOS>
We
count
ourselves
on
level
benches
with
legislators
.
<EOS>
And
a
man
who
speaks
effectively
through
music
is
compelled
to
something
more
difficult
than
parliamentary
eloquence
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
the
last
word
Klesmer
wheeled
from
the
piano
and
walked
away
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Arrowpoint
colored
,
and
Mr.
Bult
observed
,
with
his
usual
phlegmatic
stolidity
,
"
Your
pianist
does
not
think
small
beer
of
himself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Herr
Klesmer
is
something
more
than
a
pianist
,
"
said
Miss
Arrowpoint
,
apologetically
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
a
great
musician
in
the
fullest
sense
of
the
word
.
<EOS>
He
will
rank
with
Schubert
and
Mendelssohn
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
you
ladies
understand
these
things
,
"
said
Mr.
Bult
,
none
the
less
convinced
that
these
things
were
frivolous
because
Klesmer
had
shown
himself
a
coxcomb
.
  
<EOS>
Catherine
,
always
sorry
when
Klesmer
gave
himself
airs
,
found
an
opportunity
the
next
day
in
the
music
-
room
to
say
,
"
Why
were
you
so
heated
last
night
with
Mr.
Bult
?
<EOS>
He
meant
no
harm
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
wish
me
to
be
complaisant
to
him
?
"
said
Klesmer
,
rather
fiercely
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
is
hardly
worth
your
while
to
be
other
than
civil
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
find
no
difficulty
in
tolerating
him
,
then
?
 
<EOS>
you
have
a
respect
for
a
political
platitudinarian
as
insensible
as
an
ox
to
everything
he
ca
n't
turn
into
political
capital
.
<EOS>
You
think
his
monumental
obtuseness
suited
to
the
dignity
of
the
English
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
say
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
that
I
acted
without
dignity
,
and
you
are
offended
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
you
are
slightly
nearer
the
truth
,
"
said
Catherine
,
smiling
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
had
better
put
my
burial
-
clothes
in
my
portmanteau
and
set
off
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
that
.
<EOS>
If
I
have
to
bear
your
criticism
of
my
operetta
,
you
should
not
mind
my
criticism
of
your
impatience
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
mind
it
.
<EOS>
You
would
have
wished
me
to
take
his
ignorant
impertinence
about
a
"
mere
musician
"
without
letting
him
know
his
place
.
<EOS>
I
am
to
hear
my
gods
blasphemed
as
well
as
myself
insulted
.
<EOS>
But
I
beg
pardon
.
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
you
should
see
the
matter
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
Even
you
ca
n't
understand
the
wrath
of
the
artist
:
he
is
of
another
caste
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
true
,
"
said
Catherine
,
with
some
betrayal
of
feeling
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
of
a
caste
to
which
I
look
up
 
a
caste
above
mine
.
"
  
<EOS>
Klesmer
,
who
had
been
seated
at
a
table
looking
over
scores
,
started
up
and
walked
to
a
little
distance
,
from
which
he
said
    
"
That
is
finely
felt
 
I
am
grateful
.
<EOS>
But
I
had
better
go
,
all
the
same
.
<EOS>
I
have
made
up
my
mind
to
go
,
for
good
and
all
.
<EOS>
You
can
get
on
exceedingly
well
without
me
:
your
operetta
is
on
wheels
 
it
will
go
of
itself
.
<EOS>
And
your
Mr.
Bull
's
company
fits
me
"
wie
die
Faust
ins
Auge
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
neglecting
my
engagements
.
<EOS>
I
must
go
off
to
St.
Petersburg
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
agree
with
me
that
I
had
better
go
?
"
said
Klesmer
,
with
some
irritation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
;
if
that
is
what
your
business
and
feeling
prompt
.
<EOS>
I
have
only
to
wonder
that
you
have
consented
to
give
us
so
much
of
your
time
in
the
last
year
.
<EOS>
There
must
be
treble
the
interest
to
you
anywhere
else
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
thought
of
you
consenting
to
come
here
as
anything
else
than
a
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
I
make
the
sacrifice
?
"
said
Klesmer
,
going
to
seat
himself
at
the
piano
,
and
touching
the
keys
so
as
to
give
with
the
delicacy
of
an
echo
in
the
far
distance
a
melody
which
he
had
set
to
Heine
's
"
Ich
hab
'
dich
geliebet
und
liebe
dich
noch
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
the
mystery
,
"
said
Catherine
,
not
wanting
to
affect
anything
,
but
from
mere
agitation
.
<EOS>
From
the
same
cause
she
was
tearing
a
piece
of
paper
into
minute
morsels
,
as
if
at
a
task
of
utmost
multiplication
imposed
by
a
cruel
fairy
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
conceive
no
motive
?
"
said
Klesmer
,
folding
his
arms
.
  
<EOS>
"
None
that
seems
in
the
least
probable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
shall
tell
you
.
<EOS>
It
is
because
you
are
to
me
the
chief
woman
in
the
world
 
<EOS>
the
throned
lady
whose
colors
I
carry
between
my
heart
and
my
armor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Catherine
's
hands
trembled
so
much
that
she
could
no
longer
tear
the
paper
:
<EOS>
still
less
could
her
lips
utter
a
word
.
<EOS>
Klesmer
went
on
    
"
<EOS>
This
would
be
the
last
impertinence
in
me
,
if
I
meant
to
found
anything
upon
it
.
<EOS>
That
is
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
I
meant
no
such
thing
.
<EOS>
But
you
once
said
it
was
your
doom
to
suspect
every
man
who
courted
you
of
being
an
adventurer
,
and
what
made
you
angriest
was
men
's
imputing
to
you
the
folly
of
believing
that
they
courted
you
for
your
own
sake
.
<EOS>
Did
you
not
say
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
likely
,
"
was
the
answer
,
in
a
low
murmur
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
bitter
word
.
<EOS>
Well
,
at
least
one
man
who
has
seen
women
as
plenty
as
flowers
in
May
has
lingered
about
you
for
your
own
sake
.
<EOS>
And
since
he
is
one
whom
you
can
never
marry
,
you
will
believe
him
.
<EOS>
There
is
an
argument
in
favor
of
some
other
man
.
<EOS>
But
do
n't
give
yourself
for
a
meal
to
a
minotaur
like
Bult
.
<EOS>
I
shall
go
now
and
pack
.
<EOS>
I
shall
make
my
excuses
to
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
.
"
<EOS>
Klesmer
rose
as
he
ended
,
and
walked
quickly
toward
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
take
this
heap
of
manuscript
,
"
then
said
Catherine
,
suddenly
making
a
desperate
effort
.
<EOS>
She
had
risen
to
fetch
the
heap
from
another
table
.
<EOS>
Klesmer
came
back
,
and
they
had
the
length
of
the
folio
sheets
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
I
not
marry
the
man
who
loves
me
,
if
I
love
him
?
"
said
Catherine
.
<EOS>
To
her
<EOS>
the
effort
was
something
like
the
leap
of
a
woman
from
the
deck
into
the
lifeboat
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
too
hard
 
<EOS>
impossible
 
<EOS>
you
could
not
carry
it
through
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
worth
what
you
would
have
to
encounter
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
accept
the
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
thought
a
_
mésalliance
_
for
you
<EOS>
and
I
should
be
liable
to
the
worst
accusations
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
the
accusations
you
are
afraid
of
?
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
of
nothing
but
that
we
should
miss
the
passing
of
our
lives
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
decisive
word
had
been
spoken
:
there
was
no
doubt
concerning
the
end
willed
by
each
:
there
only
remained
the
way
of
arriving
at
it
,
and
Catherine
determined
to
take
the
straightest
possible
.
<EOS>
She
went
to
her
father
and
mother
in
the
library
,
and
told
them
that
she
had
promised
to
marry
Klesmer
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
's
state
of
mind
was
pitiable
.
<EOS>
Imagine
Jean
Jacques
,
after
his
essay
on
the
corrupting
influence
of
the
arts
,
waking
up
among
children
of
nature
who
had
no
idea
of
grilling
the
raw
bone
they
offered
him
for
breakfast
with
the
primitive
flint
knife
;
or
Saint
Just
,
after
fervidly
denouncing
all
recognition
of
pre
-
eminence
,
receiving
a
vote
of
thanks
for
the
unbroken
mediocrity
of
his
speech
,
which
warranted
the
dullest
patriots
in
delivering
themselves
at
equal
length
.
<EOS>
Something
of
the
same
sort
befell
the
authoress
of
"
Tasso
,
"
when
what
she
had
safely
demanded
of
the
dead
Leonora
was
enacted
by
her
own
Catherine
.
<EOS>
It
is
hard
for
us
to
live
up
to
our
own
eloquence
,
and
keep
pace
with
our
winged
words
,
while
we
are
treading
the
solid
earth
and
are
liable
to
heavy
dining
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
it
has
long
been
understood
that
the
proprieties
of
literature
are
not
those
of
practical
life
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
naturally
wished
for
the
best
of
everything
.
<EOS>
She
not
only
liked
to
feel
herself
at
a
higher
level
of
literary
sentiment
than
the
ladies
with
whom
she
associated
;
she
wished
not
to
be
behind
them
in
any
point
of
social
consideration
.
<EOS>
While
Klesmer
was
seen
in
the
light
of
a
patronized
musician
,
his
peculiarities
were
picturesque
and
acceptable
:
but
to
see
him
by
a
sudden
flash
in
the
light
of
her
son
-
in
-
law
gave
her
a
burning
sense
of
what
the
world
would
say
.
<EOS>
And
the
poor
lady
had
been
used
to
represent
her
Catherine
as
a
model
of
excellence
.
  
<EOS>
Under
the
first
shock
she
forgot
everything
but
her
anger
,
and
snatched
at
any
phrase
that
would
serve
as
a
weapon
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
Klesmer
has
presumed
to
offer
himself
to
you
,
your
father
shall
horsewhip
him
off
the
premises
.
<EOS>
Pray
,
speak
,
Mr.
Arrowpoint
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
father
took
his
cigar
from
his
mouth
,
and
rose
to
the
occasion
by
saying
,
"
This
will
never
do
,
Cath
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
!
"
cried
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
;
"
who
in
their
senses
ever
thought
it
would
do
?
<EOS>
You
might
as
well
say
poisoning
and
strangling
will
not
do
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
comedy
you
have
got
up
,
Catherine
.
<EOS>
Else
you
are
mad
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
sane
and
serious
,
mamma
,
and
Herr
Klesmer
is
not
to
blame
.
<EOS>
He
never
thought
of
my
marrying
him
.
<EOS>
I
found
out
that
he
loved
me
,
and
loving
him
,
I
told
him
I
would
marry
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Leave
that
unsaid
,
Catherine
,
"
said
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
,
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"
Every
one
else
will
say
that
for
you
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
a
public
fable
.
<EOS>
Every
one
will
say
that
you
must
have
made
an
offer
to
a
man
who
has
been
paid
to
come
to
the
house
 
<EOS>
who
is
<EOS>
nobody
knows
what
 
<EOS>
a
gypsy
,
a
Jew
,
a
mere
bubble
of
the
earth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
,
mamma
,
"
said
Catherine
,
indignant
in
her
turn
.
<EOS>
"
We
all
know
he
is
a
genius
 
as
Tasso
was
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Those
times
were
not
these
,
nor
is
Klesmer
Tasso
,
"
said
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
,
getting
more
heated
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
sting
in
_
that
_
sarcasm
,
except
the
sting
of
undutifulness
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
hurt
you
,
mamma
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
not
give
up
the
happiness
of
my
life
to
ideas
that
I
do
n't
believe
in
and
customs
<EOS>
I
have
no
respect
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
lost
all
sense
of
duty
,
then
?
<EOS>
You
have
forgotten
that
you
are
our
only
child
 
that
it
lies
with
you
to
place
a
great
property
in
the
right
hands
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
are
the
right
hands
?
<EOS>
My
grandfather
gained
the
property
in
trade
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Arrowpoint
,
_
will
_
you
sit
by
and
hear
this
without
speaking
?
"
  
"
I
am
a
gentleman
,
Cath
.
<EOS>
We
expect
you
to
marry
a
gentleman
,
"
said
the
father
,
exerting
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
a
man
connected
with
the
institutions
of
this
country
,
"
said
the
mother
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
woman
in
your
position
has
serious
duties
.
<EOS>
Where
duty
and
inclination
clash
,
she
must
follow
duty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
deny
that
,
"
said
Catherine
,
getting
colder
in
proportion
to
her
mother
's
heat
.
<EOS>
"
But
one
may
say
very
true
things
and
apply
them
falsely
.
<EOS>
People
can
easily
take
the
sacred
word
duty
as
a
name
for
what
they
desire
any
one
else
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
parent
's
desire
makes
no
duty
for
you
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
within
reason
.
<EOS>
But
before
I
give
up
the
happiness
of
my
life
 
"
  
"
Catherine
,
Catherine
,
it
will
not
be
your
happiness
,
"
said
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
,
in
her
most
raven
-
like
tones
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
what
seems
to
me
my
happiness
 
before
I
give
it
up
,
I
must
see
some
better
reason
than
the
wish
that
I
should
marry
a
nobleman
,
or
a
man
who
votes
with
a
party
that
he
may
be
turned
into
a
nobleman
.
<EOS>
I
feel
at
liberty
to
marry
the
man
I
love
and
think
worthy
,
unless
some
higher
duty
forbids
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
it
does
,
<EOS>
Catherine
,
though
you
are
blinded
and
can
not
see
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
woman
's
duty
not
to
lower
herself
.
<EOS>
You
are
lowering
yourself
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Arrowpoint
,
will
you
tell
your
daughter
what
is
her
duty
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
see
,
Catherine
,
that
Klesmer
is
not
the
man
for
you
,
"
said
Mr.
Arrowpoint
.
<EOS>
"
He
wo
n't
do
at
the
head
of
estates
.
<EOS>
He
has
a
deuced
foreign
look
 
is
an
unpractical
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
really
ca
n't
see
what
that
has
to
do
with
it
,
papa
.
<EOS>
The
land
of
England
has
often
passed
into
the
hands
of
foreigners
 
Dutch
soldiers
,
sons
of
foreign
women
of
bad
character
:
 
if
our
land
were
sold
to
-
morrow
it
would
very
likely
pass
into
the
hands
of
some
foreign
merchant
on
'
Change
.
<EOS>
It
is
in
everybody
's
mouth
that
successful
swindlers
may
buy
up
half
the
land
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
How
can
I
stem
that
tide
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
never
do
to
argue
about
marriage
,
Cath
,
"
said
Mr.
Arrowpoint
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
no
use
getting
up
the
subject
like
a
parliamentary
question
.
<EOS>
We
must
do
as
other
people
do
.
<EOS>
We
must
think
of
the
nation
and
the
public
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
see
any
public
good
concerned
here
,
papa
,
"
said
Catherine
.
<EOS>
"
Why
is
it
to
be
expected
of
any
heiress
that
she
should
carry
the
property
gained
in
trade
into
the
hands
of
a
certain
class
?
<EOS>
That
seems
to
be
a
ridiculous
mishmash
of
superannuated
customs
and
false
ambition
.
<EOS>
I
should
call
it
a
public
evil

<EOS>
People
had
better
make
a
new
sort
of
public
good
by
changing
their
ambitions

"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
mere
sophistry
,
Catherine
,
"
said
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
.
<EOS>
"
Because
you
do
n't
wish
to
marry
a
nobleman

you
are
not
obliged

marry
a
mountebank

a
charlatan

I
can
not

words

<EOS>
"
No

I
dare
say
not

rejoined
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
,
with
significant
scorn
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
got
to
a
pitch
at
which
we
are
not
likely
to
understand
each
other

<EOS>
"
It
ca
n't
be
done

said
Mr.

wishing
to
substitute
a
better
-
humored
reasoning
for
his
wife
's
impetuosity

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
man
like
Klesmer
ca
n't
marry
such
a
property
as
yours

<EOS>
It
ca
n't
be
done

<EOS>

<EOS>

It
certainly
will
not

done

said
Mrs.

imperiously
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
is
the
man

<EOS>
Let
him
be
fetched

<EOS>
"
I
can
not
fetch
him
to
be
insulted

said
Catherine
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
will
be
achieved
by
that

<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
would
wish
him
to
know
that
in
marrying
you
he
will
not
marry
your
fortune

said
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
.
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
;
if
it
were
so
,
I
should
wish
him
to
know
it

"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
had
better
fetch
him

<EOS>
Catherine
only
went
into
the
music
-
room
and
said
,
"
Come
.
"
<EOS>
She
felt
no
need
to
prepare
Klesmer

<EOS>
"
Herr
Klesmer

"
said
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
,
with
a
rather
contemptuous
stateliness
,
"
it
is
unnecessary
to
repeat
what
has
passed
between
us

our
daughter

<EOS>
Mr.
Arrowpoint
will
tell
you
our
resolution

<EOS>
"
Your
marrying

out
of
the
question

said
Mr.
Arrowpoint
,
rather
too
heavily
weighted
with
his
task
,
and
standing
in
an
embarrassment
unrelieved
by
a
cigar
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
wild
scheme
altogether
.
<EOS>
A
man
has
been
called
out
for
less
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
taken
a
base
advantage
of
our
confidence

"
burst
in
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
,
unable
to
carry
out
her
purpose
and
leave
the
burden
of
speech
to
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
Klesmer
made
a
low
bow
in
silent
irony
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
pretension
is
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
You
had
better
give
it
up
and
leave
the
house
at
once
,
"
continued
Mr.
Arrowpoint
.
<EOS>
He
wished
to
do
without
mentioning
the
money
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
give
up
nothing
without
reference
to
your
daughter
's
wish
,
"
said
Klesmer
.
<EOS>
"
My
engagement
is
to
her

"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
useless

discuss
the
question

said
Mrs.

We
shall
never
consent
to
the
marriage

If
Catherine
disobeys

disinherit

You
will
not

right

should
know

<EOS>
"
Madam
,
her
fortune
has
been
the
only
thing
I
have
had
to
regret
about
her
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
ask
her
if
she
will
not
think
the
sacrifice
greater
than
I
am
worthy
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
no
sacrifice
to
me
,
"
said
Catherine
,
"
except
that
I
am
sorry
to
hurt
my
father
and
mother
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
felt
my
fortune
to
be
a
wretched
fatality
of
my
life

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
to
defy
us
,
then
?
"
said
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
marry
Herr
Klesmer
,
"
said
Catherine
,
firmly
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
had
better
not
count
on
our
relenting
,
"
said
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
,
whose
manners
suffered
from
that
impunity
in
insult
which
has
been
reckoned
among
the
privileges
of
women
.
  
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
said
Klesmer
,
"
certain
reasons
forbid
me
to
retort
.
<EOS>
But
understand
that
I
consider
it
out
of
the
power
either
of
you
,
or
of
your
fortune
,
to
confer
on
me
anything
that
I
value
.
<EOS>
My
rank
as
an
artist
is
of
my
own
winning
,
and
I
would
not
exchange
it
for
any
other
.
<EOS>
I
am
able
to
maintain
your
daughter
,
and
I
ask
for
no
change
in
my
life
but
her
companionship
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
leave
the
house
,
however
,
"
said
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
go
at
once
,
"
said
Klesmer
,
bowing
and
quitting
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
there
be
no
misunderstanding
,
mamma
,
"
said
Catherine
;
"
I
consider
myself
engaged
to
Herr
Klesmer
,
and
I
intend
to
marry
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
mother
turned
her
head
away
and
waved
her
hand
in
sign
of
dismissal
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
very
fine
,
"
said
Mr.
Arrowpoint
,
when
Catherine
was
gone
;
"
but
what
the
deuce
are
we
to
do
with
the
property
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
Harry
Brendall
.
<EOS>
He
can
take
the
name
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Harry
Brendall
will
get
through
it
all
in
no
time
,
"
said
Mr.
Arrowpoint
,
relighting
his
cigar
.
  
<EOS>
And
thus
,
with
nothing
settled
<EOS>
but
the
determination
of
the
lovers
,
Klesmer
had
left
Quetcham
.
        
<EOS>
Among
the
heirs
of
Art
,
as
is
the
division
of
the
promised
land
,
each
    
has
to
win
his
portion
by
hard
fighting
:
the
bestowal
is
after
the
    
manner
of
prophecy
,
and
is
a
title
without
possession
.
<EOS>
To
carry
the
    
map
of
an
ungotten
estate
in
your
pocket
is
a
poor
sort
of
copyhold
.
    
<EOS>
And
in
fancy
to
cast
his
shoe
over
Eden
is
little
warrant
that
a
man
    
shall
ever
set
the
sole
of
his
foot
on
an
acre
of
his
own
there

<EOS>
The
most
obstinate
beliefs
that
mortals
entertain
about
themselves
are
    
such
as
they
have
no
evidence
for
beyond
a
constant
,
spontaneous
    
pulsing
of
their
self
-
satisfaction
 
as
it
were
a
hidden
seed
of
    
madness
,
a
confidence
that
they
can
move
the
world
without
precise
    
notion
of
standing
-
place
or
lever
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
go
to
church
,
mamma
,
"
said
Gwendolen
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
"
I
prefer
seeing
Herr
Klesmer
alone
.
"
(
He
had
written
in
reply
to
her
note
that
he
would
be
with
her
at
eleven
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
hardly
correct
,
I
think
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
anxiously
.
  
<EOS>
"
Our
affairs
are
too
serious
for
us
to
think
of
such
nonsensical
rules
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
contemptuously
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
insulting
as
well
as
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
not
mind
Isabel
sitting
with
you
?
<EOS>
She
would
be
reading
in
a
corner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
she
could
not
:
she
would
bite
her
nails
and
stare
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
too
irritating
.
<EOS>
Trust
my
judgment
,
mamma
,
I
must
be
alone
,
Take
them
all
to
church
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
had
her
way
,
of
course
;
only
that
Miss
Merry
and
two
of
the
girls
stayed
at
home
,
to
give
the
house
a
look
of
habitation
by
sitting
at
the
dining
-
room
windows
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
delicious
Sunday
morning
.
<EOS>
The
melancholy
waning
sunshine
of
autumn
rested
on
the
half
-
strown
grass
and
came
mildly
through
the
windows
in
slanting
bands
of
brightness
over
the
old
furniture
,
and
the
glass
panel
that
reflected
the
furniture
;
over
the
tapestried
chairs
with
their
faded
flower
-
wreaths
,
the
dark
enigmatic
pictures
,
the
superannuated
organ
at
which
Gwendolen
had
pleased
herself
with
acting
Saint
Cecelia
on
her
first
joyous
arrival
,
the
crowd
of
pallid
,
dusty
knicknacks
seen
through
the
open
doors
of
the
antechamber
where
she
had
achieved
the
wearing
of
her
Greek
dress
as
Hermione
.
<EOS>
This
last
memory
was
just
now
very
busy
in
her
;
for
had
not
Klesmer
then
been
struck
with
admiration
of
her
pose
and
expression
?
<EOS>
Whatever
he
had
said
,
whatever
she
imagined
him
to
have
thought
,
was
at
this
moment
pointed
with
keenest
interest
for
her
:
perhaps
she
had
never
before
in
her
life
felt
so
inwardly
dependent
,
so
consciously
in
need
of
another
person
's
opinion
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
new
fluttering
of
spirit
within
her
,
a
new
element
of
deliberation
in
her
self
-
estimate
which
had
hitherto
been
a
blissful
gift
of
intuition
.
<EOS>
Still
it
was
the
recurrent
burden
of
her
inward
soliloquy
that
Klesmer
had
seen
but
little
of
her
,
and
any
unfavorable
conclusion
of
his
must
have
too
narrow
a
foundation
.
<EOS>
She
really
felt
clever
enough
for
anything
.
  
<EOS>
To
fill
up
the
time
she
collected
her
volumes
and
pieces
of
music
,
and
laying
them
on
the
top
of
the
piano
,
set
herself
to
classify
them
.
<EOS>
Then
catching
the
reflection
of
her
movements
in
the
glass
panel
,
she
was
diverted
to
the
contemplation
of
the
image
there
and
walked
toward
it
.
<EOS>
Dressed
in
black
,
without
a
single
ornament
,
and
with
the
warm
whiteness
of
her
skin
set
off
between
her
light
-
brown
coronet
of
hair
and
her
square
-
cut
bodice
,
she
might
have
tempted
an
artist
to
try
again
the
Roman
trick
of
a
statue
in
black
,
white
,
and
tawny
marble
.
<EOS>
Seeing
her
image
slowly
advancing
,
she
thought
"
I
_
am
_
beautiful
"
 
not
exultingly
,
but
with
grave
decision
.
<EOS>
Being
beautiful
was
after
all
the
condition
on
which
she
most
needed
external
testimony
.
<EOS>
If
any
one
objected
to
the
turn
of
her
nose
or
the
form
of
her
neck
and
chin
,
she
had
not
the
sense
that
she
could
presently
show
her
power
of
attainment
in
these
branches
of
feminine
perfection
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
not
much
time
to
fill
up
in
this
way
before
the
sound
of
wheels
,
the
loud
ring
,
and
<EOS>
the
opening
doors
assured
her
that
she
was
not
by
any
accident
to
be
disappointed
.
<EOS>
This
slightly
increased
her
inward
flutter
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
her
self
-
confidence
,
she
dreaded
Klesmer
as
part
of
that
unmanageable
world
which
was
independent
of
her
wishes
 
<EOS>
something
vitriolic
that
would
not
cease
to
burn
because
you
smiled
or
frowned
at
it
.
<EOS>
Poor
thing
!
<EOS>
she
was
at
a
higher
crisis
of
her
woman
's
fate
than
in
her
last
experience
with
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
The
questioning
then
,
was
whether
she
should
take
a
particular
man
as
a
husband
.
<EOS>
The
inmost
fold
of
her
questioning
now
was
whether
she
need
take
a
husband
at
all
 
whether
she
could
not
achieve
substantially
for
herself
and
know
gratified
ambition
without
bondage
.
  
<EOS>
Klesmer
made
his
most
deferential
bow
in
the
wide
doorway
of
the
antechamber
 
showing
also
the
deference
of
the
finest
gray
kerseymere
trousers
and
perfect
gloves
(
the
'
masters
of
those
who
know
'
are
happily
altogether
human
)
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
met
him
with
unusual
gravity
,
and
holding
out
her
hand
said
,
"
It
is
most
kind
of
you
to
come
,
Herr
Klesmer
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
have
not
thought
me
presumptuous
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
took
your
wish
as
a
command
that
did
me
honor
,
"
said
Klesmer
,
with
answering
gravity
.
<EOS>
He
was
really
putting
by
his
own
affairs
in
order
to
give
his
utmost
attention
to
what
Gwendolen
might
have
to
say
;
but
his
temperament
was
still
in
a
state
of
excitation
from
the
events
of
yesterday
,
likely
enough
to
give
his
expressions
a
more
than
usually
biting
edge
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
for
once
was
under
too
great
a
strain
of
feeling
to
remember
formalities
.
<EOS>
She
continued
standing
near
the
piano
,
and
Klesmer
took
his
stand
near
the
other
end
of
it
with
his
back
to
the
light
and
his
terribly
omniscient
eyes
upon
her
.
<EOS>
No
affectation
was
of
use
,
and
she
began
without
delay
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
consult
you
,
Herr
Klesmer
.
<EOS>
We
have
lost
all
our
fortune
;
we
have
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
must
get
my
own
bread
,
and
I
desire
to
provide
for
my
mamma
,
so
as
to
save
her
from
any
hardship
.
<EOS>
The
only
way
I
can
think
of
 
<EOS>
and
I
should
like
it
better
than
anything
 
<EOS>
is
to
be
an
actress
 
to
go
on
the
stage
.
<EOS>
But
,
of
course
,
I
should
like
to
take
a
high
position
,
and
I
thought
 
if
you
thought
I
could
"
 
here
Gwendolen
became
a
little
more
nervous
 
"
it
would
be
better
for
me
to
be
a
singer
 
to
study
singing
also
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Klesmer
put
down
his
hat
upon
the
piano
,
and
folded
his
arms
as
if
to
concentrate
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
"
Gwendolen
resumed
,
turning
from
pale
to
pink
and
back
again
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
my
method
of
singing
is
very
defective
;
but
I
have
been
ill
taught
.
<EOS>
I
could
be
better
taught
;
I
could
study
.
<EOS>
And
you
will
understand
my
wish
:
 
to
sing
and
act
too
,
like
Grisi
,
is
a
much
higher
position
.
<EOS>
Naturally
,
I
should
wish
to
take
as
high
rank
as
I
can
.
<EOS>
And
I
can
rely
on
your
judgment
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
will
tell
me
the
truth
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
somehow
had
the
conviction
that
now
she
made
this
serious
appeal
the
truth
would
be
favorable
.
  
<EOS>
Still
Klesmer
did
not
speak
.
<EOS>
He
drew
off
his
gloves
quickly
,
tossed
them
into
his
hat
,
rested
his
hands
on
his
hips
,
and
walked
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
was
filled
with
compassion
for
this
girl
:
he
wanted
to
put
a
guard
on
his
speech
.
<EOS>
When
he
turned
again
,
he
looked
at
her
with
a
mild
frown
of
inquiry
,
and
said
with
gentle
though
quick
utterance
,
"
You
have
never
seen
anything
,
I
think
,
of
artists
and
their
lives
?
 
<EOS>
I
mean
of
musicians
,
actors
,
artists
of
that
kind
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
not
perturbed
by
a
reference
to
this
obvious
fact
in
the
history
of
a
young
lady
<EOS>
hitherto
well
provided
for
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
 
pardon
me
,
"
said
Klesmer
,
again
pausing
near
the
piano
 
"
in
coming
to
a
conclusion
on
such
a
matter
as
this
,
everything
must
be
taken
into
consideration
 
<EOS>
you
are
perhaps
twenty
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
twenty
-
one
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
a
slight
fear
rising
in
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
think
I
am
too
old
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Klesmer
pouted
his
under
lip
and
shook
his
long
fingers
upward
in
a
manner
totally
enigmatic
.
  
<EOS>
"
Many
persons
begin
later
than
others
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
betrayed
by
her
habitual
consciousness
of
having
valuable
information
to
bestow
.
  
<EOS>
Klesmer
took
no
notice
,
but
said
with
more
studied
gentleness
than
ever
,
"
You
have
probably
not
thought
of
an
artistic
career
until
now
:
you
did
not
entertain
the
notion
,
the
longing
 
<EOS>
what
shall
I
say
?
 
<EOS>
you
did
not
wish
yourself
an
actress
,
or
anything
of
that
sort
,
till
the
present
trouble
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
exactly
<EOS>
:
but
I
was
fond
of
acting
.
<EOS>
I
have
acted
;
you
saw
me
,
if
you
remember
 
you
saw
me
here
in
charades
,
and
as
Hermione
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
really
fearing
that
Klesmer
had
forgotten
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
"
he
answered
quickly
,
"
I
remember
 
I
remember
perfectly
,
"
and
again
walked
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
It
was
difficult
for
him
to
refrain
from
this
kind
of
movement
when
he
was
in
any
argument
either
audible
or
silent
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
felt
that
she
was
being
weighed
.
<EOS>
The
delay
was
unpleasant
.
<EOS>
But
she
did
not
yet
conceive
that
the
scale
could
dip
on
the
wrong
side
,
and
it
seemed
to
her
only
graceful
to
say
,
"
I
shall
be
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
taking
the
trouble
to
give
me
your
advice
,
whatever
it
maybe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Harleth
,
"
said
Klesmer
,
turning
toward
her
and
speaking
with
a
slight
increase
of
accent
,
"
I
will
veil
nothing
from
you
in
this
matter
.
<EOS>
I
should
reckon
myself
guilty
if
I
put
a
false
visage
on
things
 
made
them
too
black
or
too
white
.
<EOS>
The
gods
have
a
curse
for
him
who
willingly
tells
another
the
wrong
road
.
<EOS>
And
if
I
misled
one
who
is
so
young
,
so
beautiful
 
<EOS>
who
,
I
trust
,
will
find
her
happiness
along
the
right
road
,
I
should
regard
myself
as
a
 
_
Bösewicht
_
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
the
last
word
Klesmer
's
voice
had
dropped
to
a
loud
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
felt
a
sinking
of
heart
under
this
unexpected
solemnity
,
and
kept
a
sort
of
fascinated
gaze
on
Klesmer
's
face
,
as
he
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
beautiful
young
lady
 
you
have
been
brought
up
in
ease
 
<EOS>
you
have
done
what
you
would
 
<EOS>
you
have
not
said
to
yourself
,
"
I
must
know
this
exactly
<EOS>
,
"
"
I
must
understand
this
exactly
,
"
"
I
must
do
this
exactly
,
"
"
 
in
uttering
these
three
terrible
_
musts
_
<EOS>
,
Klesmer
lifted
up
three
long
fingers
in
succession
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
sum
,
you
have
not
been
called
upon
to
be
anything
but
a
charming
young
lady
,
whom
it
is
an
impoliteness
to
find
fault
with
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
paused
an
instant
;
then
resting
his
fingers
on
his
hips
again
,
and
thrusting
out
his
powerful
chin
,
he
said
    
"
<EOS>
Well
,
then
,
with
that
preparation
,
you
wish
to
try
the
life
of
an
artist
;
you
wish
to
try
a
life
of
arduous
,
unceasing
work
,
and
 
uncertain
praise
.
<EOS>
Your
praise
would
have
to
be
earned
,
like
your
bread
;
and
both
would
come
slowly
,
scantily
 
what
do
I
say
?
 
<EOS>
they
may
hardly
come
at
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
tone
of
discouragement
,
which
Klesmer
had
hoped
might
suffice
without
anything
more
unpleasant
,
roused
some
resistance
in
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
With
a
slight
turn
of
her
head
away
from
him
,
and
an
air
of
pique
,
she
said
    
"
I
thought
that
you
,
being
an
artist
,
would
consider
the
life
one
of
the
most
honorable
and
delightful
.
<EOS>
And
if
I
can
do
nothing
better
?
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
can
put
up
with
the
same
risks
as
other
people
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
nothing
better
?
"
said
Klesmer
,
a
little
fired
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
my
dear
Miss
Harleth
,
you
could
do
nothing
better
 
<EOS>
neither
man
nor
woman
could
do
anything
better
 
if
you
could
do
what
was
best
or
good
of
its
kind
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
decrying
the
life
of
the
true
artist
.
<EOS>
I
am
exalting
it
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
it
is
out
of
the
reach
of
any
but
choice
organizations
 
natures
framed
to
love
perfection
and
to
labor
for
it
;
ready
,
like
all
true
lovers
,
to
endure
,
to
wait
,
to
say
,
I
am
not
yet
worthy
,
but
<EOS>
she
 
Art
,
my
mistress
 
is
worthy
,
and
I
will
live
to
merit
her
.
<EOS>
An
honorable
life
?
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
But
the
honor
comes
from
the
inward
vocation
and
the
hard
-
won
achievement
:
there
is
no
honor
in
donning
the
life
as
a
livery
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Some
excitement
of
yesterday
had
revived
in
Klesmer
and
hurried
him
into
speech
a
little
aloof
from
his
immediate
friendly
purpose
.
<EOS>
He
had
wished
as
delicately
as
possible
to
rouse
in
Gwendolen
a
sense
of
her
unfitness
for
a
perilous
,
difficult
course
;
but
it
was
his
wo
nt
to
be
angry
with
the
pretensions
of
incompetence
,
and
he
was
in
danger
of
getting
chafed
.
<EOS>
Conscious
of
this
,
he
paused
suddenly
.
<EOS>
But
Gwendolen
's
chief
impression
was
that
he
had
not
yet
denied
her
the
power
of
doing
what
would
be
good
of
its
kind
.
<EOS>
Klesmer
's
fervor
seemed
to
be
a
sort
of
glamor
such
as
he
was
prone
to
throw
over
things
in
general
;
and
what
she
desired
to
assure
him
of
was
that
she
was
not
afraid
of
some
preliminary
hardships
.
<EOS>
The
belief
that
to
present
herself
in
public
on
the
stage
must
produce
an
effect
such
as
she
had
been
used
to
feel
certain
of
in
private
life
;
was
like
a
bit
of
her
flesh
 
<EOS>
it
was
not
to
be
peeled
off
readily
,
but
must
come
with
blood
and
pain
.
<EOS>
She
said
,
in
a
tone
of
some
insistance
    
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
prepared
to
bear
hardships
at
first
.
<EOS>
Of
course
no
one
can
become
celebrated
all
at
once
.
<EOS>
And
it
is
not
necessary
that
every
one
should
be
first
-
rate
 
either
actresses
or
singers
.
<EOS>
If
you
would
be
so
kind
as
to
tell
me
what
steps
I
should
take
,
I
shall
have
the
courage
to
take
them
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mind
going
up
hill
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
easier
than
the
dead
level
of
being
a
governess
.
<EOS>
I
will
take
any
steps
you
recommend
.
"
  
<EOS>
Klesmer
was
convinced
now
that
he
must
speak
plainly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
the
steps
,
not
that
I
recommend
,
but
that
will
be
forced
upon
you
.
<EOS>
It
is
all
one
,
so
far
,
what
your
goal
will
be
 
excellence
,
celebrity
,
second
,
third
rateness
 
<EOS>
it
is
all
one
.
<EOS>
You
must
go
to
town
under
the
protection
of
your
mother
.
<EOS>
You
must
put
yourself
under
training
 
<EOS>
musical
,
dramatic
,
theatrical
:
 
<EOS>
whatever
you
desire
to
do
you
have
to
learn
"
 
here
<EOS>
Gwendolen
looked
as
if
she
were
going
to
speak
,
but
Klesmer
lifted
up
his
hand
and
said
,
decisively
,
"
I
know
.
<EOS>
You
have
exercised
your
talents
 
<EOS>
you
recite
 
<EOS>
you
sing
 
from
the
drawing
-
room
_
standpunkt
_
.
<EOS>
My
dear
Fräulein
,
you
must
unlearn
all
that
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
yet
conceived
what
excellence
is
:
you
must
unlearn
your
mistaken
admirations
.
<EOS>
You
must
know
what
you
have
to
strive
for
,
and
then
you
must
subdue
your
mind
and
body
to
unbroken
discipline
.
<EOS>
Your
mind
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
For
you
must
not
be
thinking
of
celebrity
:
put
that
candle
out
of
your
eyes
,
and
look
only
at
excellence
.
<EOS>
You
would
of
course
earn
nothing
 
<EOS>
you
could
get
no
engagement
for
a
long
while
.
<EOS>
You
would
need
money
for
yourself
and
your
family
.
<EOS>
But
that
,
"
here
Klesmer
frowned
and
shook
his
fingers
as
if
to
dismiss
a
triviality
,
"
that
could
perhaps
be
found
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
turned
pink
and
pale
during
this
speech
.
<EOS>
Her
pride
had
felt
a
terrible
knife
-
edge
,
and
the
last
sentence
only
made
the
smart
keener
.
<EOS>
She
was
conscious
of
appearing
moved
,
and
tried
to
escape
from
her
weakness
by
suddenly
walking
to
a
seat
and
pointing
out
a
chair
to
Klesmer
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
take
it
,
but
turned
a
little
in
order
to
face
her
and
leaned
against
the
piano
.
<EOS>
At
that
moment
she
wished
that
she
had
not
sent
for
him
:
this
first
experience
of
being
taken
on
some
other
ground
than
that
of
her
social
rank
and
her
beauty
was
becoming
bitter
to
her
.
<EOS>
Klesmer
,
preoccupied
with
a
serious
purpose
,
went
on
without
change
of
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
what
sort
of
issue
might
be
fairly
expected
from
all
this
self
-
denial
?
<EOS>
You
would
ask
that
.
<EOS>
It
is
right
that
your
eyes
should
be
open
to
it
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
truthfully
.
<EOS>
This
issue
would
be
uncertain
,
and
,
most
probably
,
would
not
be
worth
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
these
relentless
words
Klesmer
put
out
his
lip
and
looked
through
his
spectacles
with
the
air
of
a
monster
impenetrable
by
beauty
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
eyes
began
to
burn
,
but
the
dread
of
showing
weakness
urged
her
to
added
self
-
control
.
<EOS>
She
compelled
herself
to
say
,
in
a
hard
tone
    
<EOS>
"
You
think
I
want
talent
,
or
am
too
old
to
begin
.
"
  
<EOS>
Klesmer
made
a
sort
of
hum
,
and
then
descended
on
an
emphatic
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
The
desire
and
the
training
should
have
begun
seven
years
ago
 
or
a
good
deal
earlier
.
<EOS>
A
mountebank
's
child
who
helps
her
father
to
earn
shillings
when
she
is
six
years
old
 
<EOS>
a
child
that
inherits
a
singing
throat
from
a
long
line
of
choristers
and
learns
to
sing
as
it
learns
to
talk
,
has
a
likelier
beginning
.
<EOS>
Any
great
achievement
in
acting
or
in
music
grows
with
the
growth
.
<EOS>
Whenever
an
artist
has
been
able
to
say
,
"
I
came
,
I
saw
,
I
conquered
,
"
it
has
been
at
the
end
of
patient
practice
.
<EOS>
Genius
at
first
is
little
more
than
a
great
capacity
for
receiving
discipline
.
<EOS>
Singing
and
acting
,
like
the
fine
dexterity
of
the
juggler
with
his
cups
and
balls
,
require
a
shaping
of
the
organs
toward
a
finer
and
finer
certainty
of
effect
.
<EOS>
Your
muscles
 
your
whole
frame
 
must
go
like
a
watch
,
true
,
true
to
a
hair
.
<EOS>
That
is
the
work
of
spring
-
time
,
before
habits
have
been
determined
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
pretend
to
genius
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
still
feeling
that
she
might
somehow
do
what
Klesmer
wanted
to
represent
as
impossible
.
<EOS>
"
I
only
suppose
that
I
might
have
a
little
talent
 
enough
to
improve
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
deny
that
,
"
said
Klesmer
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
had
been
put
in
the
right
track
some
years
ago
and
had
worked
well
you
might
now
have
made
a
public
singer
,
though
I
do
n't
think
your
voice
would
have
counted
for
much
in
public
.
<EOS>
For
the
stage
your
personal
charms
and
intelligence
might
then
have
told
without
the
present
drawback
of
inexperience
 
lack
of
discipline
 
lack
of
instruction
.
"
  
<EOS>
Certainly
Klesmer
seemed
cruel
,
but
his
feeling
was
the
reverse
of
cruel
.
<EOS>
Our
speech
,
even
when
we
are
most
single
-
minded
,
can
never
take
its
line
absolutely
from
one
impulse
;
but
Klesmer
's
was
,
as
far
as
possible
,
directed
by
compassion
for
poor
Gwendolen
's
ignorant
eagerness
to
enter
on
a
course
of
which
he
saw
all
the
miserable
details
with
a
definiteness
which
he
could
not
if
he
would
have
conveyed
to
her
mind
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
however
,
was
not
convinced
.
<EOS>
Her
self
-
opinion
rallied
,
and
since
the
counselor
whom
she
had
called
in
gave
a
decision
of
such
severe
peremptoriness
,
she
was
tempted
to
think
that
his
judgment
was
not
only
fallible
but
biased
.
<EOS>
It
occurred
to
her
that
a
simpler
and
wiser
step
for
her
to
have
taken
would
have
been
to
send
a
letter
through
the
post
to
the
manager
of
a
London
theatre
,
asking
him
to
make
an
appointment
.
<EOS>
She
would
make
no
further
reference
to
her
singing
;
Klesmer
,
she
saw
,
had
set
himself
against
her
singing
.
<EOS>
But
she
felt
equal
to
arguing
with
him
about
her
going
on
the
stage
,
and
she
answered
in
a
resistant
tone
    
<EOS>
"
I
understood
,
of
course
,
that
no
one
can
be
a
finished
actress
at
once
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
impossible
to
tell
beforehand
whether
I
should
succeed
;
but
that
seems
to
me
a
reason
why
I
should
try
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
thought
that
I
might
have
taken
an
engagement
at
a
theatre
meanwhile
,
so
as
to
earn
money
and
study
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ca
n't
be
done
,
my
dear
Miss
Harleth
 
I
speak
plainly
 
it
ca
n't
be
done
.
<EOS>
I
must
clear
your
mind
of
these
notions
which
have
no
more
resemblance
to
reality
than
a
pantomime
.
<EOS>
Ladies
and
gentlemen
think
that
when
they
have
made
their
toilet
and
drawn
on
their
gloves
they
are
as
presentable
on
the
stage
as
in
a
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
No
manager
thinks
that
.
<EOS>
With
all
your
grace
and
charm
,
if
you
were
to
present
yourself
as
an
aspirant
to
the
stage
,
a
manager
would
either
require
you
to
pay
as
an
amateur
for
being
allowed
to
perform
or
he
would
tell
you
to
go
and
be
taught
 
trained
to
bear
yourself
on
the
stage
,
as
a
horse
,
however
beautiful
,
must
be
trained
for
the
circus
;
to
say
nothing
of
that
study
which
would
enable
you
to
personate
a
character
consistently
,
and
animate
it
with
the
natural
language
of
face
,
gesture
,
and
tone
.
<EOS>
For
you
to
get
an
engagement
fit
for
you
<EOS>
straight
away
is
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
really
can
not
understand
that
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
rather
haughtily
 
then
,
checking
herself
,
she
added
in
another
tone
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
obliged
to
you
if
you
will
explain
how
it
is
that
such
poor
actresses
get
engaged
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
to
the
theatre
several
times
,
and
I
am
sure
there
were
actresses
who
seemed
to
me
to
act
not
at
all
well
and
who
were
quite
plain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
my
dear
Miss
Harleth
,
that
is
the
easy
criticism
of
the
buyer
.
<EOS>
We
who
buy
slippers
toss
away
this
pair
and
the
other
as
clumsy
;
but
there
went
an
apprenticeship
to
the
making
of
them
.
<EOS>
Excuse
me
;
you
could
not
at
present
teach
one
of
those
actresses
;
but
there
is
certainly
much
that
she
could
teach
you
.
<EOS>
For
example
,
she
can
pitch
her
voice
so
as
to
be
heard
:
ten
to
one
you
could
not
do
it
till
after
many
trials
.
<EOS>
Merely
to
stand
and
move
on
the
stage
is
an
art
 
requires
practice
.
<EOS>
It
is
understood
that
we
are
not
now
talking
of
a
_
comparse
_
in
a
petty
theatre
who
earns
the
wages
of
a
needle
-
woman
.
<EOS>
That
is
out
of
the
question
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
must
earn
more
than
that
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
with
a
sense
of
wincing
rather
than
of
being
refuted
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
think
I
could
soon
learn
to
do
tolerably
well
all
those
little
things
you
have
mentioned
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
so
very
stupid
.
<EOS>
And
even
in
Paris
,
I
am
sure
<EOS>
,
I
saw
two
actresses
playing
important
ladies
'
parts
who
were
not
at
all
ladies
and
quite
ugly
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
have
no
particular
talent
,
but
I
_
must
_
think
it
is
an
advantage
,
even
on
the
stage
,
to
be
a
lady
and
not
a
perfect
fright
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
let
us
understand
each
other
,
"
said
Klesmer
,
with
a
flash
of
new
meaning
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
speaking
of
what
you
would
have
to
go
through
if
you
aimed
at
becoming
a
real
artist
 
if
you
took
music
and
the
drama
as
a
higher
vocation
in
which
you
would
strive
after
excellence
.
<EOS>
On
that
head
,
what
I
have
said
stands
fast
.
<EOS>
You
would
find
 
after
your
education
in
doing
things
slackly
for
one
-
and
-
twenty
years
 
great
difficulties
in
study
;
you
would
find
mortifications
in
the
treatment
you
would
get
when
you
presented
yourself
on
the
footing
of
skill
.
<EOS>
You
would
be
subjected
to
tests
;
people
would
no
longer
feign
not
to
see
your
blunders
.
<EOS>
You
would
at
first
only
be
accepted
on
trial
.
<EOS>
You
would
have
to
bear
what
I
may
call
a
glaring
insignificance
:
any
success
must
be
won
by
the
utmost
patience
.
<EOS>
You
would
have
to
keep
your
place
in
a
crowd
,
and
after
all
it
is
likely
you
would
lose
it
and
get
out
of
sight
.
<EOS>
If
you
determine
to
face
these
hardships
and
still
try
,
you
will
have
the
dignity
of
a
high
purpose
,
even
though
you
may
have
chosen
unfortunately
.
<EOS>
You
will
have
some
merit
,
though
you
may
win
no
prize
.
<EOS>
You
have
asked
my
judgment
on
your
chances
of
winning
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
pretend
to
speak
absolutely
;
but
measuring
probabilities
,
my
judgment
is
:
 
you
will
hardly
achieve
more
than
mediocrity
.
"
  
<EOS>
Klesmer
had
delivered
himself
with
emphatic
rapidity
,
and
now
paused
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
was
motionless
,
looking
at
her
hands
,
which
lay
over
each
other
on
her
lap
,
till
the
deep
-
toned
,
long
-
drawn
"
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
But
_
,
"
with
which
he
resumed
,
had
a
startling
effect
,
and
made
her
look
at
him
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
 
there
are
certainly
other
ideas
,
other
dispositions
with
which
a
young
lady
may
take
up
an
art
that
will
bring
her
before
the
public
.
<EOS>
She
may
rely
on
the
unquestioned
power
of
her
beauty
as
a
passport
.
<EOS>
She
may
desire
to
exhibit
herself
to
an
admiration
which
dispenses
with
skill
.
<EOS>
This
goes
a
certain
way
on
the
stage
:
not
in
music
:
but
on
the
stage
,
beauty
is
taken
when
there
is
nothing
more
commanding
to
be
had
.
<EOS>
Not
without
some
drilling
,
however
:
as
I
have
said
before
,
technicalities
have
in
any
case
to
be
mastered
.
<EOS>
But
these
excepted
,
we
have
here
nothing
to
do
with
art
.
<EOS>
The
woman
who
takes
up
this
career
is
not
an
artist
:
she
is
usually
one
who
thinks
of
entering
on
a
luxurious
life
by
a
short
and
easy
road
 
perhaps
by
marriage
 
<EOS>
that
is
her
most
brilliant
chance
,
and
the
rarest
.
<EOS>
Still
,
her
career
will
not
be
luxurious
to
begin
with
:
she
can
hardly
earn
her
own
poor
bread
independently
at
once
,
and
the
indignities
she
will
be
liable
to
are
such
as
I
will
not
speak
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
desire
to
be
independent
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
deeply
stung
and
confusedly
apprehending
some
scorn
for
herself
in
Klesmer
's
words
.
<EOS>
"
That
was
my
reason
for
asking
whether
I
could
not
get
an
immediate
engagement
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
can
not
know
how
things
go
on
about
theatres
.
<EOS>
But
I
thought
that
I
could
have
made
myself
independent
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
money
,
and
I
will
not
accept
help
from
any
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
wounded
pride
could
not
rest
without
making
this
disclaimer
.
<EOS>
It
was
intolerable
to
her
that
Klesmer
should
imagine
her
to
have
expected
other
help
from
him
than
advice
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
a
hard
saying
for
your
friends
,
"
said
Klesmer
,
recovering
the
gentleness
of
tone
with
which
he
had
begun
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
given
you
pain
.
<EOS>
That
was
inevitable
.
<EOS>
I
was
bound
to
put
the
truth
,
the
unvarnished
truth
,
before
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
said
 
I
will
not
say
 
you
will
do
wrong
to
choose
the
hard
,
climbing
path
of
an
endeavoring
artist
.
<EOS>
You
have
to
compare
its
difficulties
with
those
of
any
less
hazardous
 
any
more
private
course
which
opens
itself
to
you
.
<EOS>
If
you
take
that
more
courageous
resolve
I
will
ask
leave
to
shake
hands
with
you
on
the
strength
of
our
freemasonry
,
where
we
are
all
vowed
to
the
service
of
art
,
and
to
serve
her
by
helping
every
fellow
-
servant
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
was
silent
,
again
looking
at
her
hands
.
<EOS>
She
felt
herself
very
far
away
from
taking
the
resolve
that
would
enforce
acceptance
;
and
after
waiting
an
instant
or
two
,
Klesmer
went
on
with
deepened
seriousness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
there
is
the
duty
of
service
there
must
be
the
duty
of
accepting
it
.
<EOS>
The
question
is
not
one
of
personal
obligation
.
<EOS>
And
in
relation
to
practical
matters
immediately
affecting
your
future
 
excuse
my
permitting
myself
to
mention
in
confidence
an
affair
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
I
am
expecting
an
event
which
would
make
it
easy
for
me
to
exert
myself
on
your
behalf
in
furthering
your
opportunities
of
instruction
and
residence
in
London
 
under
the
care
,
that
is
,
of
your
family
 
without
need
for
anxiety
on
your
part
.
<EOS>
If
you
resolve
to
take
art
as
a
bread
-
study
,
you
need
only
undertake
the
study
at
first
;
the
bread
will
be
found
without
trouble
.
<EOS>
The
event
I
mean
is
my
marriage
 
in
fact
 
you
will
receive
this
as
a
matter
of
confidence
 
my
marriage
with
Miss
Arrowpoint
,
which
will
more
than
double
such
right
as
I
have
to
be
trusted
by
you
as
a
friend
.
<EOS>
Your
friendship
will
have
greatly
risen
in
value
for
_
her
_
by
your
having
adopted
that
generous
labor
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
face
had
begun
to
burn
.
<EOS>
That
Klesmer
was
about
to
marry
Miss
Arrowpoint
<EOS>
caused
her
no
surprise
,
and
at
another
moment
she
would
have
amused
herself
in
quickly
imagining
the
scenes
that
must
have
occurred
at
Quetcham
.
<EOS>
But
what
engrossed
her
feeling
,
what
filled
her
imagination
now
,
was
the
panorama
of
her
own
immediate
future
that
Klesmer
's
words
seemed
to
have
unfolded
.
<EOS>
The
suggestion
of
Miss
Arrowpoint
as
a
patroness
was
only
another
detail
added
to
its
repulsiveness
:
Klesmer
's
proposal
to
help
her
seemed
an
additional
irritation
after
the
humiliating
judgment
he
had
passed
on
her
capabilities
.
<EOS>
His
words
had
really
bitten
into
her
self
-
confidence
and
turned
it
into
the
pain
of
a
bleeding
wound
;
and
the
idea
of
presenting
herself
before
other
judges
was
now
poisoned
with
the
dread
that
they
also
might
be
harsh
;
they
also
would
not
recognize
the
talent
she
was
conscious
of
.
<EOS>
But
she
controlled
herself
,
and
rose
from
her
seat
before
she
made
any
answer
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
natural
that
she
should
pause
.
<EOS>
She
went
to
the
piano
and
looked
absently
at
leaves
of
music
,
pinching
up
the
corners
.
<EOS>
At
last
she
turned
toward
Klesmer
and
said
,
with
almost
her
usual
air
of
proud
equality
,
which
in
this
interview
had
not
been
hitherto
perceptible
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
congratulate
you
sincerely
,
Herr
Klesmer
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
never
saw
any
one
so
admirable
as
Miss
Arrowpoint
.
<EOS>
And
I
have
to
thank
you
for
every
sort
of
kindness
this
morning
.
<EOS>
But
I
ca
n't
decide
now
.
<EOS>
If
I
make
the
resolve
you
have
spoken
of
,
I
will
use
your
permission
 
<EOS>
I
will
let
you
know
.
<EOS>
But
I
fear
the
obstacles
are
too
great
.
<EOS>
In
any
case
,
I
am
deeply
obliged
to
you
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
bold
of
me
to
ask
you
to
take
this
trouble
.
"
  
<EOS>
Klesmer
's
inward
remark
was
,
"
She
will
never
let
me
know
.
"
<EOS>
But
with
the
most
thorough
respect
in
his
manner
,
he
said
,
"
Command
me
at
any
time
.
<EOS>
There
is
an
address
on
this
card
which
will
always
find
me
with
little
delay
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
he
had
taken
up
his
hat
and
was
going
to
make
his
bow
,
Gwendolen
's
better
self
,
conscious
of
an
ingratitude
which
the
clear
-
seeing
Klesmer
must
have
penetrated
,
made
a
desperate
effort
to
find
its
way
above
the
stifling
layers
of
egoistic
disappointment
and
irritation
.
<EOS>
Looking
at
him
with
a
glance
of
the
old
gayety
,
she
put
out
her
hand
,
and
said
with
a
smile
,
"
If
I
take
the
wrong
road
,
it
will
not
be
because
of
your
flattery
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
God
forbid
that
you
should
take
any
road
but
one
where
you
will
find
and
give
happiness
!
"
said
Klesmer
,
fervently
.
<EOS>
Then
,
in
foreign
fashion
,
he
touched
her
fingers
lightly
with
his
lips
,
and
in
another
minute
she
heard
the
sound
of
his
departing
wheels
getting
more
distant
on
the
gravel
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
had
never
in
her
life
felt
so
miserable
.
<EOS>
No
sob
came
,
no
passion
of
tears
,
to
relieve
her
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
were
burning
;
and
the
noonday
only
brought
into
more
dreary
clearness
the
absence
of
interest
from
her
life
.
<EOS>
All
memories
,
all
objects
,
the
pieces
of
music
displayed
,
the
open
piano
 
<EOS>
the
very
reflection
of
herself
in
the
glass
 
seemed
no
better
than
the
packed
-
up
shows
of
a
departing
fair
.
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
since
her
consciousness
began
,
she
was
having
a
vision
of
herself
on
the
common
level
,
and
had
lost
the
innate
sense
that
there
were
reasons
why
she
should
not
be
slighted
,
elbowed
,
jostled
 
treated
like
a
passenger
with
a
third
-
class
ticket
,
in
spite
of
private
objections
on
her
own
part
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
move
about
<EOS>
;
the
prospects
begotten
by
disappointment
were
too
oppressively
preoccupying
;
she
threw
herself
into
the
shadiest
corner
of
a
settee
,
and
pressed
her
fingers
over
her
burning
eyelids
.
<EOS>
Every
word
that
Klesmer
had
said
seemed
to
have
been
branded
into
her
memory
,
as
most
words
are
which
bring
with
them
a
new
set
of
impressions
and
make
an
epoch
for
us
.
<EOS>
Only
a
few
hours
before
,
the
dawning
smile
of
self
-
contentment
rested
on
her
lips
as
she
vaguely
imagined
a
future
suited
to
her
wishes
:
it
seemed
but
the
affair
of
a
year
or
so
for
her
to
become
the
most
approved
Juliet
of
the
time
:
or
,
if
Klesmer
encouraged
her
idea
of
being
a
singer
,
to
proceed
by
more
gradual
steps
to
her
place
in
the
opera
,
while
she
won
money
and
applause
by
occasional
performances
.
<EOS>
Why
not
?
<EOS>
At
home
,
at
school
,
among
acquaintances
,
she
had
been
used
to
have
her
conscious
superiority
admitted
;
and
she
had
moved
in
a
society
where
everything
,
from
low
arithmetic
to
high
art
,
is
of
the
amateur
kind
,
politely
supposed
to
fall
short
of
perfection
only
because
gentlemen
and
ladies
are
not
obliged
to
do
more
than
they
like
 
<EOS>
otherwise
they
would
probably
give
forth
abler
writings
,
and
show
themselves
more
commanding
artists
than
any
the
world
is
at
present
obliged
to
put
up
with
.
<EOS>
The
self
-
confident
visions
that
had
beguiled
her
were
not
of
a
highly
exceptional
kind
;
and
she
had
at
least
shown
some
rationality
in
consulting
the
person
who
knew
the
most
and
had
flattered
her
the
least
.
<EOS>
In
asking
Klesmer
's
advice
,
however
,
she
had
rather
been
borne
up
by
a
belief
in
his
latent
admiration
than
bent
on
knowing
anything
more
unfavorable
that
might
have
lain
behind
his
slight
objections
to
her
singing
;
and
the
truth
she
had
asked
for
,
with
an
expectation
that
it
would
be
agreeable
,
had
come
like
a
lacerating
thong
.
  
<EOS>
"
Too
old
 
should
have
begun
seven
years
ago
 
you
will
not
,
at
best
,
achieve
more
than
mediocrity
 
hard
,
incessant
work
,
uncertain
praise
 
<EOS>
bread
coming
slowly
,
scantily
,
perhaps
not
at
all
 
mortifications
,
people
no
longer
feigning
not
to
see
<EOS>
your
blunders
 
glaring
insignificance
<EOS>
"
 
all
these
phrases
rankled
in
her
;
and
even
more
galling
was
the
hint
that
she
could
only
be
accepted
on
the
stage
as
a
beauty
who
hoped
to
get
a
husband
.
<EOS>
The
"
indignities
"
that
she
might
be
visited
with
had
no
very
definite
form
for
her
,
but
the
mere
association
of
anything
called
"
indignity
"
with
herself
,
roused
a
resentful
alarm
.
<EOS>
And
along
with
the
vaguer
images
which
were
raised
by
those
biting
words
,
came
the
precise
conception
of
disagreeables
which
her
experience
enabled
her
to
imagine
.
<EOS>
How
could
she
take
her
mamma
and
the
four
sisters
to
London
?
<EOS>
if
it
were
not
possible
for
her
to
earn
money
at
once
?
<EOS>
And
as
for
submitting
to
be
a
_
protégé
_
,
and
asking
her
mamma
to
submit
with
her
to
the
humiliation
of
being
supported
by
Miss
Arrowpoint
 
that
was
as
bad
as
being
a
governess
;
nay
,
worse
;
for
suppose
the
end
of
all
her
study
to
be
as
worthless
as
Klesmer
clearly
expected
it
to
be
,
the
sense
of
favors
received
and
never
repaid
,
would
embitter
the
miseries
of
disappointment
.
<EOS>
Klesmer
doubtless
had
magnificent
ideas
about
helping
artists
;
but
how
could
he
know
the
feelings
of
ladies
in
such
matters
?
<EOS>
It
was
all
over
:
she
had
entertained
a
mistaken
hope
;
and
there
was
an
end
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
An
end
of
it
!
<EOS>
"
said
Gwendolen
,
aloud
,
starting
from
her
seat
as
she
heard
the
steps
and
voices
of
her
mamma
and
sisters
coming
in
from
church
.
<EOS>
She
hurried
to
the
piano
and
began
gathering
together
her
pieces
of
music
with
assumed
diligence
,
while
the
expression
on
her
pale
face
and
in
her
burning
eyes
was
what
would
have
suited
a
woman
enduring
a
wrong
which
she
might
not
resent
,
but
would
probably
revenge
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
darling
,
"
said
gentle
Mrs.
Davilow
,
entering
,
"
I
see
by
the
wheel
-
marks
that
Klesmer
has
been
here
.
<EOS>
Have
you
been
satisfied
with
the
interview
?
<EOS>
"
She
had
some
guesses
as
to
its
object
,
but
felt
timid
about
implying
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Satisfied
,
mamma
?
<EOS>
oh
,
yes
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
in
a
high
,
hard
tone
,
for
which
she
must
be
excused
,
because
she
dreaded
a
scene
of
emotion
.
<EOS>
If
she
did
not
set
herself
resolutely
to
feign
proud
indifference
,
she
felt
that
she
must
fall
into
a
passionate
outburst
of
despair
,
which
would
cut
her
mamma
more
deeply
than
all
the
rest
of
their
calamities
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
uncle
and
aunt
were
disappointed
at
not
seeing
you
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
coming
near
the
piano
,
and
watching
Gwendolen
's
movements
.
<EOS>
"
I
only
said
that
you
wanted
rest
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
right
,
mamma
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
in
the
same
tone
,
turning
to
put
away
some
music
.
  
<EOS>
"
Am
I
not
to
know
anything
now
,
Gwendolen
?
<EOS>
Am
I
always
to
be
in
the
dark
?
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
too
keenly
sensitive
to
her
daughter
's
manner
and
expression
not
to
fear
that
something
painful
had
occurred
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
really
nothing
to
tell
now
,
mamma
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
in
a
still
higher
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
a
mistaken
idea
about
something
I
could
do
.
<EOS>
Herr
Klesmer
has
undeceived
me
.
<EOS>
That
is
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
look
and
speak
in
that
way
,
my
dear
child
:
I
can
not
bear
it
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
breaking
down
.
<EOS>
She
felt
an
undefinable
terror
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
looked
at
her
a
moment
in
silence
,
biting
her
inner
lip
;
then
she
went
up
to
her
,
and
putting
her
hands
on
her
mamma
's
shoulders
,
said
,
with
a
drop
in
her
voice
to
the
lowest
undertone
,
"
Mamma
,
do
n't
speak
to
me
now
.
<EOS>
It
is
useless
to
cry
and
waste
our
strength
over
what
ca
n't
be
altered
.
<EOS>
You
will
live
at
Sawyer
's
Cottage
,
and
I
am
going
to
the
bishop
's
daughters
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
more
to
be
said
.
<EOS>
Things
can
not
be
altered
,
and
who
cares
?
<EOS>
It
makes
no
difference
to
any
one
else
what
we
do
.
<EOS>
We
must
try
not
to
care
ourselves
.
<EOS>
We
must
not
give
way
.
<EOS>
I
dread
giving
way
.
<EOS>
Help
me
to
be
quiet
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
was
like
a
frightened
child
under
her
daughter
's
face
and
voice
;
her
tears
were
arrested
and
she
went
away
in
silence
.
      
<EOS>
"
I
question
things
but
do
not
find
  
One
that
will
answer
to
my
mind
:
  
<EOS>
And
all
the
world
appears
unkind
.

WORDSWORTH
.
   
<EOS>
Gwendolen
was
glad
that
she
had
got
through
her
interview
with
Klesmer
before
meeting
her
uncle
and
aunt
.
<EOS>
She
had
made
up
her
mind
now
that
there
were
only
disagreeables
before
her
,
and
she
felt
able
to
maintain
a
dogged
calm
in
the
face
of
any
humiliation
that
might
be
proposed
.
  
<EOS>
The
meeting
did
not
happen
until
the
Monday
,
when
Gwendolen
went
to
the
rectory
with
her
mamma
.
<EOS>
They
had
called
at
Sawyer
's
Cottage
by
the
way
,
and
had
seen
every
cranny
of
the
narrow
rooms
in
a
mid
-
day
light
,
unsoftened
by
blinds
and
curtains
;
for
the
furnishing
to
be
done
by
gleanings
from
the
rectory
had
not
yet
begun
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
_
shall
_
<EOS>
you
endure
it
,
mamma
?
"
said
Gwendolen
,
as
they
walked
away
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
opened
her
lips
while
they
were
looking
round
at
the
bare
walls
and
floors
,
and
the
little
garden
with
the
cabbage
-
stalks
,
and
the
yew
arbor
<EOS>
all
dust
and
cobwebs
within
.
<EOS>
"
You
and
the
four
girls
all
in
that
closet
of
a
room
,
with
the
green
and
yellow
paper
pressing
on
your
eyes
?
<EOS>
And
without
me
?
"
  
"
It
will
be
some
comfort
that
you
have
not
to
bear
it
too
,
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
it
were
not
that
I
must
get
some
money
,
I
would
rather
be
there
than
go
to
be
a
governess
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
set
yourself
against
it
beforehand
,
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
If
you
go
to
the
palace
you
will
have
every
luxury
about
you
.
<EOS>
And
you
know
how
much
you
have
always
cared
for
that
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
find
it
so
hard
as
going
up
and
down
those
steep
narrow
stairs
,
and
hearing
the
crockery
rattle
through
the
house
,
and
the
dear
girls
talking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
like
a
bad
dream
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
impetuously
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
believe
that
my
uncle
will
let
you
go
to
such
a
place
.
<EOS>
He
ought
to
have
taken
some
other
steps
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
be
unreasonable
,
dear
child
.
<EOS>
What
could
he
have
done
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
was
for
him
to
find
out
.
<EOS>
It
seems
to
me
a
very
extraordinary
world
if
people
in
our
position
must
sink
in
this
way
all
at
once
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
the
other
worlds
with
which
she
was
conversant
being
constructed
with
a
sense
of
fitness
that
arranged
her
own
future
agreeably
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
her
temper
that
framed
her
sentences
under
this
entirely
new
pressure
of
evils
:
she
could
have
spoken
more
suitably
on
the
vicissitudes
in
other
people
's
lives
,
though
it
was
never
her
aspiration
to
express
herself
virtuously
so
much
as
cleverly
 
a
point
to
be
remembered
in
extenuation
of
her
words
,
which
were
usually
worse
than
she
was
.
  
<EOS>
And
,
notwithstanding
the
keen
sense
of
her
own
bruises
,
she
was
capable
of
some
compunction
when
her
uncle
and
aunt
received
her
with
a
more
affectionate
kindness
than
they
had
ever
shown
before
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
but
be
struck
by
the
dignified
cheerfulness
with
which
they
talked
of
the
necessary
economies
in
their
way
of
living
,
and
in
the
education
of
the
boys
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
's
worth
of
character
,
a
little
obscured
by
worldly
opportunities
 
as
the
poetic
beauty
of
women
is
obscured
by
the
demands
of
fashionable
dressing
 
showed
itself
to
great
advantage
under
this
sudden
reduction
of
fortune
.
<EOS>
Prompt
and
methodical
,
he
had
set
himself
not
only
to
put
down
his
carriage
,
but
to
reconsider
his
worn
suits
of
clothes
,
to
leave
off
meat
for
breakfast
,
to
do
without
periodicals
,
to
get
Edwy
from
school
and
arrange
hours
of
study
for
all
the
boys
under
himself
,
and
to
order
the
whole
establishment
on
the
sparest
footing
possible
.
<EOS>
For
all
healthy
people
economy
has
its
pleasures
;
and
the
rector
's
spirit
had
spread
through
the
household
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Gascoigne
and
Anna
,
who
always
made
papa
their
model
,
really
did
not
miss
anything
they
cared
about
for
themselves
,
and
in
all
sincerity
felt
that
the
saddest
part
of
the
family
losses
was
the
change
for
Mrs.
Davilow
and
her
children
.
  
<EOS>
Anna
for
the
first
time
could
merge
her
resentment
on
behalf
of
Rex
in
her
sympathy
with
Gwendolen
;
and
Mrs.
Gascoigne
was
disposed
to
hope
that
trouble
would
have
a
salutary
effect
on
her
niece
,
without
thinking
it
her
duty
to
add
any
bitters
by
way
of
increasing
the
salutariness
.
<EOS>
They
had
both
been
busy
devising
how
to
get
blinds
and
curtains
for
the
cottage
out
of
the
household
stores
;
but
with
delicate
feeling
they
left
these
matters
in
the
back
-
ground
,
and
talked
at
first
of
Gwendolen
's
journey
,
and
the
comfort
it
was
to
her
mamma
to
have
her
at
home
again
.
  
<EOS>
In
fact
there
was
nothing
for
Gwendolen
to
take
as
a
justification
for
extending
her
discontent
with
events
to
the
persons
immediately
around
her
,
and
she
felt
shaken
into
a
more
alert
attention
,
as
if
by
a
call
to
drill
that
everybody
else
was
obeying
,
when
her
uncle
began
in
a
voice
of
firm
kindness
to
talk
to
her
of
the
efforts
he
had
been
making
to
get
her
a
situation
which
would
offer
her
as
many
advantages
as
possible
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
had
not
forgotten
Grandcourt
,
but
the
possibility
of
further
advances
from
that
quarter
was
something
too
vague
for
a
man
of
his
good
sense
to
be
determined
by
it
:
uncertainties
of
that
kind
must
not
now
slacken
his
action
in
doing
the
best
he
could
for
his
niece
under
actual
conditions
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
felt
that
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
,
Gwendolen
;
for
a
position
in
a
good
family
where
you
will
have
some
consideration
is
not
to
be
had
at
a
moment
's
notice
.
<EOS>
And
however
long
we
waited
we
could
hardly
find
one
where
you
would
be
better
off
than
at
Bishop
Mompert
's
.
<EOS>
I
am
known
to
both
him
and
Mrs.
Mompert
,
and
that
of
course
is
an
advantage
to
you
.
<EOS>
Our
correspondence
has
gone
on
favorably
;
but
I
can
not
be
surprised
that
Mrs.
Mompert
wishes
to
see
you
before
making
an
absolute
engagement
.
<EOS>
She
thinks
of
arranging
for
you
to
meet
her
at
Wanchester
when
she
is
on
her
way
to
town
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
you
will
feel
the
interview
rather
trying
for
you
,
<EOS>
my
dear
;
but
you
will
have
a
little
time
to
prepare
your
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
_
why
_
<EOS>
she
wants
to
see
me
,
uncle
?
"
said
Gwendolen
,
whose
mind
had
quickly
gone
over
various
reasons
that
an
imaginary
Mrs.
Mompert
with
three
daughters
might
be
supposed
to
entertain
,
reasons
all
of
a
disagreeable
kind
to
the
person
presenting
herself
for
inspection
.
  
<EOS>
The
rector
smiled
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
alarmed
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
She
would
like
to
have
a
more
precise
idea
of
you
than
my
report
can
give
.
<EOS>
And
a
mother
is
naturally
scrupulous
about
a
companion
for
her
daughters
.
<EOS>
I
have
told
her
you
are
very
young
.
<EOS>
But
she
herself
exercises
a
close
supervision
over
her
daughters
'
education
,
and
that
makes
her
less
anxious
as
to
age
.
<EOS>
She
is
a
woman
of
taste
and
also
of
strict
principle
,
and
objects
to
having
a
French
person
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
feel
sure
that
she
will
think
your
manners
and
accomplishments
as
good
as
she
is
likely
to
find
;
and
over
the
religious
and
moral
tone
of
the
education
she
,
and
indeed
the
bishop
himself
,
will
preside
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
dared
not
answer
,
but
the
repression
of
her
decided
dislike
to
the
whole
prospect
sent
an
unusually
deep
flush
over
her
face
and
neck
,
subsiding
as
quickly
as
it
came
.
<EOS>
Anna
,
full
of
tender
fears
,
put
her
little
hand
into
her
cousin
's
,
and
Mr.
Gascoigne
was
too
kind
a
man
not
to
conceive
something
of
the
trial
which
this
sudden
change
must
be
for
a
girl
like
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
Bent
on
giving
a
cheerful
view
of
things
,
he
went
on
,
in
an
easy
tone
of
remark
,
not
as
if
answering
supposed
objections
    
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
highly
of
the
position
,
that
I
should
have
been
tempted
to
try
and
get
it
for
Anna
,
if
she
had
been
at
all
likely
to
meet
Mrs.
Mompert
's
wants
.
<EOS>
It
is
really
a
home
,
with
a
continuance
of
education
in
the
highest
sense
:
"
governess
"
is
a
misnomer
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
's
views
are
of
a
more
decidedly
Low
Church
color
than
my
own
 
<EOS>
he
is
a
close
friend
of
Lord
Grampian
's
;
but
,
though
privately
strict
,
he
is
not
by
any
means
narrow
in
public
matters
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
has
created
as
little
dislike
in
his
diocese
as
any
bishop
on
the
bench
.
<EOS>
He
has
always
remained
friendly
to
me
,
though
before
his
promotion
,
when
he
was
an
incumbent
of
this
diocese
,
we
had
a
little
controversy
about
the
Bible
Society
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
rector
's
words
were
too
pregnant
with
satisfactory
meaning
to
himself
for
him
to
imagine
the
effect
they
produced
in
the
mind
of
his
niece
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Continuance
of
education
"
 
"
bishop
's
views
"
 
"
privately
strict
"
 
"
Bible
Society
,
"
 
it
was
as
if
he
had
introduced
a
few
snakes
at
large
for
the
instruction
of
ladies
who
regarded
them
as
all
alike
furnished
with
poison
-
bags
,
and
,
biting
or
stinging
,
according
to
convenience
.
<EOS>
To
Gwendolen
,
already
shrinking
from
the
prospect
open
to
her
,
such
phrases
came
like
the
growing
heat
of
a
burning
glass
 
not
at
all
as
the
links
of
persuasive
reflection
which
they
formed
for
the
good
uncle
.
<EOS>
She
began
,
desperately
,
to
seek
an
alternative
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
was
another
situation
,
I
think
,
mamma
spoke
of
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
with
determined
self
-
mastery
.
  
'
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
"
said
the
rector
,
in
rather
a
depreciatory
tone
;
"
but
that
is
in
a
school
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
the
same
satisfaction
in
your
taking
that
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
much
harder
work
,
you
are
aware
,
and
not
so
good
in
any
other
respect
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
you
have
not
an
equal
chance
of
getting
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
no
,
"
said
Mrs.
Gascoigne
,
"
it
would
be
much
less
appropriate
,
You
might
not
have
a
bedroom
to
yourself
.
"
<EOS>
And
Gwendolen
's
memories
of
school
suggested
other
particulars
which
forced
her
to
admit
to
herself
that
this
alternative
would
be
no
relief
.
<EOS>
She
turned
to
her
uncle
again
and
said
,
apparently
in
acceptance
of
his
ideas
    
"
When
is
Mrs.
Mompert
likely
to
send
for
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
rather
uncertain
,
but
she
has
promised
not
to
entertain
any
other
proposal
till
she
has
seen
you
.
<EOS>
She
has
entered
with
much
feeling
into
your
position
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
within
the
next
fortnight
,
probably
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
be
off
now
.
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
let
part
of
my
glebe
uncommonly
well
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
rector
ended
very
cheerfully
,
leaving
the
room
with
the
satisfactory
conviction
that
Gwendolen
was
going
to
adapt
herself
to
circumstances
like
a
girl
of
good
sense
.
<EOS>
Having
spoken
appropriately
,
he
naturally
supposed
that
the
effects
would
be
appropriate
;
being
accustomed
,
as
a
household
and
parish
authority
,
to
be
asked
to
"
speak
to
"
refractory
persons
,
with
the
understanding
that
the
measure
was
morally
coercive
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
stay
<EOS>
Henry
is
to
us
all
?
"
said
Mrs.
Gascoigne
,
when
her
husband
had
left
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
indeed
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
cordially
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
cheerfulness
is
a
fortune
in
itself
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
Rex
is
just
like
him
,
"
said
Mrs.
Gascoigne
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
tell
you
the
comfort
we
have
had
in
a
letter
from
him
.
<EOS>
I
must
read
you
a
little
bit
,
"
she
added
,
taking
the
letter
from
her
pocket
,
while
Anna
looked
rather
frightened
 
<EOS>
she
did
not
know
why
,
except
that
it
had
been
a
rule
with
her
not
to
mention
Rex
before
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
The
proud
mother
ran
her
eyes
over
the
letter
,
seeking
for
sentences
to
read
aloud
.
<EOS>
But
apparently
she
had
found
it
sown
with
what
might
seem
to
be
closer
allusions
than
she
desired
to
the
recent
past
,
for
she
looked
up
,
folding
the
letter
,
and
saying
    
"
However
,
he
tells
us
that
our
trouble
has
made
a
man
of
him
;
he
sees
a
reason
for
any
amount
of
work
:
he
means
to
get
a
fellowship
,
to
take
pupils
,
to
set
one
of
his
brothers
going
,
to
be
everything
that
is
most
remarkable
.
<EOS>
The
letter
is
full
of
fun
 
just
like
him
.
<EOS>
He
says
,
"
Tell
mother
she
has
put
out
an
advertisement
for
a
jolly
good
hard
-
working
son
,
in
time
to
hinder
me
from
taking
ship
;
and
I
offer
myself
for
the
place
.
<EOS>
"
The
letter
came
on
Friday
.
<EOS>
I
never
saw
my
husband
so
much
moved
by
anything
since
Rex
was
born
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
a
gain
to
balance
our
loss
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
letter
,
in
fact
,
was
what
had
helped
both
Mrs.
Gascoigne
and
Anna
to
show
Gwendolen
an
unmixed
kindliness
;
and
she
herself
felt
very
amiably
about
it
,
smiling
at
Anna
,
and
pinching
her
chin
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
Nothing
is
wrong
with
you
now
,
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
She
had
no
gratuitously
ill
-
natured
feeling
,
or
egoistic
pleasure
in
making
men
miserable
.
<EOS>
She
only
had
an
intense
objection
to
their
making
her
miserable
.
  
<EOS>
But
when
the
talk
turned
on
furniture
for
the
cottage
Gwendolen
was
not
roused
to
show
even
a
languid
interest
.
<EOS>
She
thought
that
she
had
done
as
much
as
could
be
expected
of
her
this
morning
,
and
indeed
felt
at
an
heroic
pitch
in
keeping
to
herself
the
struggle
that
was
going
on
within
her
.
<EOS>
The
recoil
of
her
mind
from
the
only
definite
prospect
allowed
her
,
was
stronger
than
even
she
had
imagined
beforehand
.
<EOS>
The
idea
of
presenting
herself
before
Mrs.
Mompert
in
the
first
instance
,
to
be
approved
or
disapproved
,
came
as
pressure
on
an
already
painful
bruise
;
even
as
a
governess
,
it
appeared
she
was
to
be
tested
and
was
liable
to
rejection
.
<EOS>
After
she
had
done
herself
the
violence
to
accept
the
bishop
and
his
wife
,
they
were
still
to
consider
whether
they
would
accept
her
;
it
was
at
her
peril
that
she
was
to
look
,
speak
,
or
be
silent
.
<EOS>
And
even
when
she
had
entered
on
her
dismal
task
of
self
-
constraint
in
the
society
of
three
girls
whom
she
was
bound
incessantly
to
edify
,
the
same
process
of
inspection
was
to
go
on
:
there
was
always
to
be
Mrs.
Mompert
's
supervision
;
always
something
or
other
would
be
expected
of
her
to
which
she
had
not
the
slightest
inclination
;
and
perhaps
the
bishop
would
examine
her
on
serious
topics
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
lately
used
to
the
social
successes
of
a
handsome
girl
,
whose
lively
venturesomeness
of
talk
has
the
effect
of
wit
,
and
who
six
weeks
before
would
have
pitied
the
dullness
of
the
bishop
rather
than
have
been
embarrassed
by
him
,
saw
the
life
before
her
as
an
entrance
into
a
penitentiary
.
<EOS>
Wild
thoughts
of
running
away
to
be
an
actress
,
in
spite
of
Klesmer
,
came
to
her
with
the
lure
of
freedom
;
but
his
words
still
hung
heavily
on
her
soul
;
they
had
alarmed
her
pride
and
even
her
maidenly
dignity
:
<EOS>
dimly
she
conceived
herself
getting
amongst
vulgar
people
who
would
treat
her
with
rude
familiarity
 
odious
men
,
whose
grins
and
smirks
would
not
be
seen
through
the
strong
grating
of
polite
society
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
daring
was
not
in
the
least
that
of
the
adventuress
;
the
demand
to
be
held
a
lady
was
in
her
very
marrow
;
and
when
she
had
dreamed
that
she
might
be
the
heroine
of
the
gaming
-
table
,
it
was
with
the
understanding
that
no
one
should
treat
her
with
the
less
consideration
,
or
presume
to
look
at
her
with
irony
as
Deronda
had
done
.
<EOS>
To
be
protected
and
petted
,
and
to
have
her
susceptibilities
consulted
in
every
detail
,
had
gone
along
with
her
food
and
clothing
as
matters
of
course
in
her
life
:
even
without
any
such
warning
as
Klesmer
's
she
could
not
have
thought
it
an
attractive
freedom
to
be
thrown
in
solitary
dependence
on
the
doubtful
civility
of
strangers
.
<EOS>
The
endurance
of
the
episcopal
penitentiary
was
less
repulsive
than
that
;
though
here
too
she
would
certainly
never
be
petted
or
have
her
susceptibilities
consulted
.
<EOS>
Her
rebellion
against
this
hard
necessity
which
had
come
just
to
her
of
all
people
in
the
world
 
to
her
whom
all
circumstances
had
concurred
in
preparing
for
something
quite
different
 
was
exaggerated
instead
of
diminished
as
one
hour
<EOS>
followed
another
,
with
the
imagination
of
what
she
might
have
expected
in
her
lot
and
what
it
was
actually
to
be
.
<EOS>
The
family
troubles
,
she
thought
,
were
easier
for
every
one
than
for
her
 
even
for
poor
dear
mamma
,
because
she
had
always
used
herself
to
not
enjoying
.
<EOS>
As
to
hoping
that
if
she
went
to
the
Momperts
'
and
was
patient
a
little
while
,
things
might
get
better
 
<EOS>
it
would
be
stupid
to
entertain
hopes
for
herself
after
all
that
had
happened
:
her
talents
<EOS>
,
it
appeared
,
would
never
be
recognized
as
anything
remarkable
,
and
there
was
not
a
single
direction
in
which
probability
seemed
to
flatter
her
wishes
.
<EOS>
Some
beautiful
girls
who
,
like
her
,
had
read
romances
where
even
plain
governesses
are
centres
of
attraction
and
are
sought
in
marriage
,
might
have
solaced
themselves
a
little
by
transporting
such
pictures
into
their
own
future
;
but
even
if
Gwendolen
's
experience
had
led
her
to
dwell
on
love
-
making
and
marriage
as
her
elysium
,
her
heart
was
too
much
oppressed
by
what
was
near
to
her
,
in
both
the
past
and
the
future
,
for
her
to
project
her
anticipations
very
far
off
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
world
-
nausea
upon
her
,
and
saw
no
reason
all
through
her
life
why
she
should
wish
to
live
.
<EOS>
No
religious
view
of
trouble
helped
her
:
her
troubles
had
in
her
opinion
all
been
caused
by
other
people
's
disagreeable
or
wicked
conduct
;
and
there
was
really
nothing
pleasant
to
be
counted
on
in
the
world
<EOS>
:
that
was
her
feeling
;
everything
else
she
had
heard
said
about
trouble
was
mere
phrase
-
making
not
attractive
enough
for
her
to
have
caught
it
up
and
repeated
it
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
sweetness
of
labor
and
fulfilled
claims
;
the
interest
of
inward
and
outward
activity
;
the
impersonal
delights
of
life
as
a
perpetual
discovery
;
the
dues
of
courage
,
fortitude
,
industry
,
which
it
is
mere
baseness
not
to
pay
toward
the
common
burden
;
the
supreme
worth
of
the
teacher
's
vocation
;
 
these
,
even
if
they
had
been
eloquently
preached
to
her
,
could
have
been
no
more
than
faintly
apprehended
doctrines
:
the
fact
which
wrought
upon
her
was
her
invariable
observation
that
for
a
lady
to
become
a
governess
 
to
"
take
a
situation
"
 
<EOS>
was
to
descend
in
life
and
to
be
treated
at
best
with
a
compassionate
patronage
.
<EOS>
And
poor
Gwendolen
had
never
dissociated
happiness
from
personal
pre
-
eminence
and
_
éclat
_
.
<EOS>
That
where
these
threatened
to
forsake
her
,
she
should
take
life
to
be
hardly
worth
the
having
,
can
not
make
her
so
unlike
the
rest
of
us
,
men
or
women
,
that
we
should
cast
her
out
of
our
compassion
;
our
moments
of
temptation
to
a
mean
opinion
of
things
in
general
being
usually
dependent
on
some
susceptibility
about
ourselves
and
some
dullness
to
subjects
which
every
one
else
would
consider
more
important
.
<EOS>
Surely
a
young
creature
is
pitiable
who
has
the
labyrinth
of
life
before
her
and
no
clue
 
to
whom
distrust
in
herself
and
her
good
fortune
has
come
as
a
sudden
shock
,
like
a
rent
across
the
path
that
she
was
treading
carelessly
.
  
<EOS>
In
spite
of
her
healthy
frame
,
her
irreconcilable
repugnance
affected
her
even
physically
;
she
felt
a
sort
of
numbness
and
could
set
about
nothing
;
the
least
urgency
,
even
that
she
should
take
her
meals
,
was
an
irritation
to
her
;
the
speech
of
others
on
any
subject
seemed
unreasonable
,
because
it
did
not
include
her
feeling
and
was
an
ignorant
claim
on
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
in
her
nature
to
busy
herself
with
the
fancies
of
suicide
to
which
disappointed
young
people
are
prone
:
what
occupied
and
exasperated
her
was
the
sense
that
there
was
nothing
for
her
but
to
live
in
a
way
she
hated
.
<EOS>
She
avoided
going
to
the
rectory
again
:
it
was
too
intolerable
to
have
to
look
and
talk
as
if
she
were
compliant
;
and
she
could
not
exert
herself
to
show
interest
about
the
furniture
of
that
horrible
cottage
.
<EOS>
Miss
Merry
was
staying
on
purpose
to
help
,
and
such
people
as
Jocosa
liked
that
sort
of
thing
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
had
to
make
excuses
for
her
not
appearing
,
even
when
Anna
came
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
For
that
calm
which
Gwendolen
had
promised
herself
to
maintain
had
changed
into
sick
motivelessness
:
she
thought
,
"
I
suppose
I
shall
begin
to
pretend
by
-
and
-
by
,
but
why
should
I
do
it
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
Her
mother
watched
her
with
silent
distress
;
and
,
lapsing
into
the
habit
of
indulgent
tenderness
<EOS>
,
she
began
to
think
what
she
imagined
that
Gwendolen
was
thinking
,
and
to
wish
that
everything
should
give
way
to
the
possibility
of
making
her
darling
less
miserable
.
  
<EOS>
One
day
when
she
was
in
the
black
and
yellow
bedroom
and
her
mother
was
lingering
there
under
the
pretext
of
considering
and
arranging
Gwendolen
's
articles
of
dress
,
she
suddenly
roused
herself
to
fetch
the
casket
which
contained
the
ornaments
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mamma
,
"
she
began
,
glancing
over
the
upper
layer
,
"
I
had
forgotten
these
things
.
<EOS>
Why
did
n't
you
remind
me
of
them
?
<EOS>
Do
see
about
getting
them
sold
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
mind
about
parting
with
them
.
<EOS>
You
gave
them
all
to
me
long
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
lifted
the
upper
tray
and
looked
below
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
we
can
do
without
them
,
darling
,
I
would
rather
keep
them
for
you
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
seating
herself
beside
Gwendolen
with
a
feeling
of
relief
that
she
was
beginning
to
talk
about
something
.
<EOS>
The
usual
relation
between
them
had
become
reversed
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
the
mother
who
tried
to
cheer
the
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
how
came
you
to
put
that
pocket
handkerchief
in
here
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
handkerchief
with
the
corner
<EOS>
torn
off
which
Gwendolen
had
thrust
in
with
the
turquoise
necklace
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
happened
to
be
with
the
necklace
 
<EOS>
I
was
in
a
hurry
.
"
<EOS>
said
Gwendolen
,
taking
the
handkerchief
away
and
putting
it
in
her
pocket
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
sell
the
necklace
,
mamma
,
"
she
added
,
a
new
feeling
having
come
over
her
about
that
rescue
of
it
which
had
formerly
been
so
offensive
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
dear
,
no
;
it
was
made
out
of
your
dear
father
's
chain
.
<EOS>
And
I
should
prefer
not
selling
the
other
things
.
<EOS>
None
of
them
are
of
any
great
value
.
<EOS>
All
my
best
ornaments
were
taken
from
me
long
ago
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
colored
.
<EOS>
She
usually
avoided
any
reference
to
such
facts
about
Gwendolen
's
step
-
father
as
that
he
had
carried
off
his
wife
's
jewelry
and
disposed
of
it
.
<EOS>
After
a
moment
's
pause
she
went
on
    
"
<EOS>
And
these
things
have
not
been
reckoned
on
for
any
expenses
.
<EOS>
Carry
them
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
would
be
quite
useless
,
mamma
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
coldly
.
<EOS>
"
Governesses
do
n't
wear
ornaments
.
<EOS>
You
had
better
get
me
a
gray
frieze
livery
and
a
straw
poke
,
such
as
my
aunt
's
charity
children
wear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
dear
,
no
;
do
n't
take
that
view
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
feel
sure
the
Momperts
will
like
you
the
better
for
being
graceful
and
elegant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
at
all
sure
what
the
Momperts
will
like
me
to
be
.
<EOS>
It
is
enough
that
I
am
expected
to
be
what
they
like
,
"
said
Gwendolen
bitterly
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
there
is
anything
you
would
object
to
less
 
anything
that
could
be
done
 
instead
of
your
going
to
the
bishop
's
,
do
say
so
,
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
what
is
in
your
heart
.
<EOS>
I
will
try
for
anything
you
wish
,
"
said
the
mother
,
beseechingly
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
keep
things
away
from
me
.
<EOS>
Let
us
bear
them
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
mamma
,
there
is
nothing
to
tell
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
do
anything
better
.
<EOS>
I
must
think
myself
fortunate
if
they
will
have
me
.
<EOS>
I
shall
get
some
money
for
you
.
<EOS>
That
is
the
only
thing
I
have
to
think
of
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
spend
any
money
this
year
:
<EOS>
you
will
have
all
the
eighty
pounds
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
far
that
will
go
in
housekeeping
;
but
you
need
not
stitch
your
poor
fingers
to
the
bone
,
and
stare
away
all
the
sight
that
the
tears
have
left
in
your
dear
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
did
not
give
any
caresses
with
her
words
as
she
had
been
used
to
do
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
even
look
at
her
mother
,
but
was
looking
at
the
turquoise
necklace
as
she
turned
it
over
her
fingers
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bless
you
for
your
tenderness
,
my
good
darling
!
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
with
tears
in
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
despair
because
there
are
clouds
now
.
<EOS>
You
are
so
young
.
<EOS>
There
may
be
great
happiness
in
store
for
you
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
any
reason
for
expecting
it
,
mamma
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
in
a
hard
tone
;
and
Mrs.
Davilow
was
silent
,
thinking
as
she
had
often
thought
before
 
"
What
did
happen
between
her
and
Mr.
Grandcourt
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
_
will
_
keep
this
necklace
,
mamma
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
laying
it
apart
and
then
closing
the
casket
.
<EOS>
"
But
do
get
the
other
things
sold
,
even
if
they
will
not
bring
much
.
<EOS>
Ask
my
uncle
what
to
do
with
them
.
<EOS>
I
shall
certainly
not
use
them
again
.
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
take
the
veil
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
if
all
the
poor
wretches
who
have
ever
taken
it
felt
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
exaggerate
evils
,
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
any
one
know
that
I
exaggerate
,
when
I
am
speaking
of
my
own
feeling
?
<EOS>
I
did
not
say
what
any
one
else
felt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
took
out
the
torn
handkerchief
from
her
pocket
again
,
and
wrapped
it
deliberately
round
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
observed
the
action
with
some
surprise
,
but
the
tone
of
her
last
words
discouraged
her
from
asking
any
question
.
  
<EOS>
The
"
feeling
"
Gwendolen
spoke
of
with
an
air
of
tragedy
was
not
to
be
explained
by
the
mere
fact
that
she
was
going
to
be
a
governess
:
she
was
possessed
by
a
spirit
of
general
disappointment
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
simply
that
she
had
a
distaste
for
what
she
was
called
on
to
do
:
the
distaste
spread
itself
over
the
world
outside
her
penitentiary
,
since
she
saw
nothing
very
pleasant
in
it
that
seemed
attainable
by
her
even
if
she
were

<EOS>
Naturally
her
grievances
did
not
seem
to
her
smaller
than
some
of
her
male
contemporaries
held
theirs
to
be
when
they
felt
a
profession
too
narrow
for
their
powers
,
and
had
an
_
à
priori
_
conviction
that
it
was
not
worth
while
to
put
forth
their
latent
abilities
.
<EOS>
Because
her
education
had
been
less
expensive
than
theirs
,
it
did
not
follow
that
she
should
have
wider
emotions
or
a
keener
intellectual
vision
.
<EOS>
Her
griefs
were
feminine
;
but
to
her
as
a
woman
they
were
not
the
less
hard
to
bear
,
and
she
felt
an
equal
right
to
the
Promethean
tone
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
movement
of
mind
which
led
her
to
keep
the
necklace
,
to
fold
it
up
in
the
handkerchief
,
and
rise
to
put
it
in
her
_
nécessaire
_
,
where
she
had
first
placed
it
when
it
had
been
returned
to
her
,
was
more
peculiar
,
and
what
would
be
called
less
reasonable
.
<EOS>
It
came
from
that
streak
of
superstition
in
her
which
attached
itself
both
to
her
confidence
and
her
terror
 
<EOS>
a
superstition
which
lingers
in
an
intense
personality
even
in
spite
of
theory
and
science
;
any
dread
or
hope
for
self
being
stronger
than
all
reasons
for
or
against
it
.
<EOS>
Why
she
should
suddenly
determine
not
to
part
with
the
necklace
was
not
much
clearer
to
her
than
why
she
should
sometimes
have
been
frightened
to
find
herself
in
the
fields
alone
:
she
had
a
confused
state
of
emotion
about
Deronda
 
<EOS>
was
it
wounded
pride
and
resentment
,
or
a
certain
awe
and
exceptional
trust
?
<EOS>
It
was
something
vague
and
yet
mastering
,
which
impelled
her
to
this
action
about
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
great
deal
of
unmapped
country
within
us
which
would
have
to
be
taken
into
account
in
an
explanation
of
our
gusts
and
storms
.
        
<EOS>
How
trace
the
why
and
wherefore
in
a
mind
reduced
to
the
barrenness
of
    
a
fastidious
egoism
,
in
which
all
direct
desires
are
dulled
,
and
have
    
dwindled
from
motives
into
a
vacillating
expectation
of
motives
:
<EOS>
a
    
mind
made
up
of
moods
,
where
a
fitful
impulse
springs
here
and
there
    
conspicuously
rank
amid
the
general
weediness
?
'
<EOS>
Tis
a
condition
apt
to
    
befall
a
life
too
much
at
large
,
unmoulded
by
the
pressure
of
    
obligation
.
<EOS>
_

Potentates

<EOS>
So
when
Grandcourt
,
after
learning
that
Gwendolen
had
left
Leubronn
,
incidentally
pronounced
that
resort
of
fashion
a
beastly
hole
,
worse
than
Baden
,
the
remark
was
conclusive
to
Mr.
Lush
that
his
patron
intended
straightway
to
return
to
Diplow
.
<EOS>
The
execution
was
sure
to
be
slower
than
the
intention
,
and
,
in
fact
,
Grandcourt
did
loiter
through
the
next
day
without
giving
any
distinct
orders
about
departure
 
perhaps
because
he
discerned
that
Lush
was
expecting
them
:
he
lingered
over
his
toilet
,
and
certainly
came
down
with
a
faded
aspect
of
perfect
distinction
which
made
fresh
complexions
and
hands
with
the
blood
in
them
,
seem
signs
of
raw
vulgarity
;
he
lingered
on
the
terrace
,
in
the
gambling
-
rooms
,
in
the
reading
-
room
,
occupying
himself
in
being
indifferent
to
everybody
and
everything
around
him
.
<EOS>
When
he
met
Lady
Mallinger
,
however
,
he
took
some
trouble
 
<EOS>
raised
his
hat
,
paused
,
and
proved
that
he
listened
to
her
recommendation
of
the
waters
by
replying
,
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
I
heard
somebody
say
how
providential
it
was
that
there
always
happened
to
be
springs
at
gambling
places
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
that
was
a
joke
,
"
said
innocent
Lady
Mallinger
,
misled
by
Grandcourt
's
languid
seriousness
,
"
in
imitation
of
the
old
one
about
the
towns
and
the
rivers
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
perhaps
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
without
change
of
expression
.
<EOS>
Lady
Mallinger
thought
this
worth
telling
to
Sir
Hugo
,
who
said
,
"
Oh
,
my
dear
,
he
is
not
a
fool
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
suppose
that
he
ca
n't
see
a
joke
.
<EOS>
He
can
play
his
cards
as
well
as
most
of
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
never
seemed
to
me
a
very
sensible
man
,
"
said
Lady
Mallinger
,
in
excuse
of
herself
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
secret
objection
to
meeting
Grandcourt
,
who
was
little
else
to
her
than
a
large
living
sign
of
what
she
felt
to
be
her
failure
as
a
wife
 
<EOS>
the
not
having
presented
Sir
Hugo
with
a
son
.
<EOS>
Her
constant
reflection
was
that
her
husband
might
fairly
regret
his
choice
,
and
if
he
had
not
been
very
good
might
have
treated
her
with
some
roughness
in
consequence
,
gentlemen
naturally
disliking
to
be
disappointed
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
,
too
,
had
a
recognition
from
Grandcourt
,
for
which
he
was
not
grateful
,
though
he
took
care
to
return
it
with
perfect
civility
.
<EOS>
No
reasoning
as
to
the
foundations
of
custom
could
do
away
with
the
early
-
rooted
feeling
that
his
birth
had
been
attended
with
injury
for
which
his
father
was
to
blame
;
and
seeing
that
<EOS>
but
for
this
injury
Grandcourt
's
prospects
might
have
been
his
,
he
was
proudly
resolute
not
to
behave
in
any
way
that
might
be
interpreted
into
irritation
on
that
score
.
<EOS>
He
saw
a
very
easy
descent
into
mean
unreasoning
rancor
and
triumph
in
others
'
frustration
;
and
being
determined
not
to
go
down
that
ugly
pit
,
he
turned
his
back
on
it
,
clinging
to
the
kindlier
affections
within
him
as
a
possession
.
<EOS>
Pride
certainly
helped
him
well
 
<EOS>
the
pride
of
not
recognizing
a
disadvantage
for
one
's
self
<EOS>
which
vulgar
minds
are
disposed
to
exaggerate
,
such
as
the
shabby
equipage
of
poverty
:
he
would
not
have
a
man
like
Grandcourt
<EOS>
suppose
himself
envied
by
him
.
<EOS>
But
there
is
no
guarding
against
interpretation
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
did
believe
that
Deronda
,
poor
devil
,
who
he
had
no
doubt
was
his
cousin
by
the
father
's
side
,
inwardly
winced
under
their
mutual
position
;
wherefore
the
presence
of
that
less
lucky
person
was
more
agreeable
to
him
than
it
would
otherwise
have
been
.
<EOS>
An
imaginary
envy
,
the
idea
that
others
feel
their
comparative
deficiency
,
is
the
ordinary
_
cortège
_
of
egoism
;
and
his
pet
dogs
were
not
the
only
beings
that
Grandcourt
liked
to
feel
his
power
over
in
making
them
jealous
.
<EOS>
Hence
he
was
civil
enough
to
exchange
several
words
with
Deronda
on
the
terrace
about
the
hunting
round
Diplow
,
and
even
said
,
"
You
had
better
come
over
for
a
run
or
two
when
the
season
begins
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lush
,
not
displeased
with
delay
,
amused
himself
very
well
,
partly
in
gossiping
with
Sir
Hugo
and
in
answering
his
questions
about
Grandcourt
's
affairs
so
far
as
they
might
affect
his
willingness
to
part
with
his
interest
in
Diplow
.
<EOS>
Also
about
Grandcourt
's
personal
entanglements
,
the
baronet
knew
enough
already
for
Lush
to
feel
released
from
silence
on
a
sunny
autumn
day
,
when
there
was
nothing
more
agreeable
to
do
in
lounging
promenades
than
to
speak
freely
of
a
tyrannous
patron
behind
his
back
.
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
willingly
inclined
his
ear
to
a
little
good
-
humored
scandal
,
which
he
was
fond
of
calling
_
traits
de
moeurs
_
;
but
he
was
strict
in
keeping
such
communications
from
hearers
who
might
take
them
too
seriously
.
<EOS>
Whatever
knowledge
he
had
of
his
nephew
's
secrets
,
he
had
never
spoken
of
it
to
Deronda
,
who
considered
Grandcourt
a
pale
-
blooded
mortal
,
but
was
far
from
wishing
to
hear
how
the
red
corpuscles
had
been
washed
out
of
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
Lush
's
policy
and
inclination
to
gratify
everybody
when
he
had
no
reason
to
the
contrary
;
and
the
baronet
always
treated
him
well
,
as
one
of
those
easy
-
handled
personages
who
,
frequenting
the
society
of
gentlemen
,
without
being
exactly
gentlemen
themselves
,
can
be
the
more
serviceable
,
like
the
second
-
best
articles
of
our
wardrobe
,
which
we
use
with
a
comfortable
freedom
from
anxiety
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
you
will
let
me
know
the
turn
of
events
,
"
said
Sir
Hugo
,
"
if
this
marriage
seems
likely
to
come
off
after
all
,
or
if
anything
else
happens
to
make
the
want
of
money
pressing
.
<EOS>
My
plan
would
be
much
better
for
him
than
burdening
Ryelands
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
true
,
"
said
Lush
,
"
only
it
must
not
be
urged
on
him
 
just
placed
in
his
way
that
the
scent
may
tickle
him
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
is
not
a
man
to
be
always
led
by
what
makes
for
his
own
interest
;
especially
if
you
let
him
see
that
it
makes
for
your
interest
too
.
<EOS>
I
'm
attached
to
him
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
I
've
given
up
everything
else
for
the
sake
of
keeping
by
him
,
and
it
has
lasted
a
good
fifteen
years
now
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
easily
get
any
one
else
to
fill
my
place
.
<EOS>
He
's
a
peculiar
character
,
is
Henleigh
Grandcourt
,
and
it
has
been
growing
on
him
of
late
years
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
'm
of
a
constant
disposition
,
and
I
've
been
a
sort
of
guardian
to
him
since
he
was
twenty
;
an
uncommonly
fascinating
fellow
he
was
then
,
to
be
sure
 
and
could
be
now
,
if
he
liked
.
<EOS>
I
'm
attached
to
him
;
and
it
would
be
a
good
deal
worse
for
him
if
he
missed
me
at
his
elbow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
did
not
think
it
needful
to
express
his
sympathy
or
even
assent
,
and
perhaps
Lush
himself
did
not
expect
this
sketch
of
his
motives
to
be
taken
as
exact
.
<EOS>
But
how
can
a
man
avoid
himself
as
a
subject
in
conversation
?
<EOS>
And
he
must
make
some
sort
of
decent
toilet
in
words
,
as
in
cloth
and
linen
.
<EOS>
Lush
's
listener
was
not
severe
:
a
member
of
Parliament
could
allow
for
the
necessities
of
verbal
toilet
;
and
the
dialogue
went
on
without
any
change
of
mutual
estimate
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
Lush
's
easy
prospect
of
indefinite
procrastination
was
cut
off
the
next
morning
by
<EOS>
Grandcourt
's
saluting
him
with
the
question
    
<EOS>
"
Are
you
making
all
the
arrangements
for
our
starting
by
the
Paris
train
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
know
you
meant
to
start
,
"
said
Lush
,
not
exactly
taken
by
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
might
have
known
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
looking
at
the
burned
length
of
his
cigar
,
and
speaking
in
that
lowered
tone
which
was
usual
with
him
when
he
meant
to
express
disgust
and
be
peremptory
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Just
see
to
everything
,
will
you
?
<EOS>
and
mind
no
brute
gets
into
the
same
carriage
with
us
.
<EOS>
And
leave
my
P.
P.
C.
at
the
Mallingers
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
consequence
they
were
at
Paris
the
next
day
;
but
here
Lush
was
gratified
by
the
proposal
or
command
that
he
should
go
straight
on
to
Diplow
and
see
that
everything
was
right
,
while
Grandcourt
and
the
valet
remained
behind
;
and
it
was
not
until
several
days
later
that
Lush
received
the
telegram
ordering
the
carriage
to
the
Wanchester
station
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
used
the
interim
actively
,
not
only
in
carrying
out
Grandcourt
's
orders
about
the
stud
and
household
,
but
in
learning
all
he
could
of
Gwendolen
,
and
how
things
were
going
on
at
Offendene
.
<EOS>
What
was
the
probable
effect
that
the
news
of
the
family
misfortunes
would
have
on
Grandcourt
's
fitful
obstinacy
he
felt
to
be
quite
incalculable
.
<EOS>
So
far
as
the
girl
's
poverty
might
be
an
argument
that
she
would
accept
an
offer
from
him
now
in
spite
of
any
previous
coyness
,
it
might
remove
that
bitter
objection
to
risk
a
repulse
which
Lush
divined
to
be
one
of
Grandcourt
's
deterring
motives
;
on
the
other
hand
,
the
certainty
of
acceptance
was
just
"
the
sort
of
thing
"
to
make
him
lapse
hither
and
thither
with
no
more
apparent
will
than
a
moth
.
<EOS>
Lush
had
had
his
patron
under
close
observation
for
many
years
,
and
knew
him
perhaps
better
than
he
knew
any
other
subject
;
but
to
know
Grandcourt
was
to
doubt
what
he
would
do
in
any
particular
case
.
<EOS>
It
might
happen
that
he
would
behave
with
an
apparent
magnanimity
,
like
the
hero
of
a
modern
French
drama
,
whose
sudden
start
into
moral
splendor
after
much
lying
and
meanness
,
leaves
you
little
confidence
as
to
any
part
of
his
career
that
may
follow
the
fall
of
the
curtain
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
what
attitude
would
have
been
more
honorable
for
a
final
scene
than
that
of
declining
to
seek
an
heiress
for
her
money
,
and
determining
to
marry
the
attractive
girl
who
had
none
?
<EOS>
But
Lush
had
some
general
certainties
about
Grandcourt
,
and
one
was
that
of
all
inward
movements
those
of
generosity
were
least
likely
to
occur
in
him
.
<EOS>
Of
what
use
,
however
,
is
a
general
certainty
that
an
insect
will
not
walk
with
his
head
hindmost
,
when
what
you
need
to
know
is
the
play
of
inward
stimulus
that
sends
him
hither
and
thither
in
a
network
of
possible
paths
?
<EOS>
Thus
Lush
was
much
at
fault
as
to
the
probable
issue
between
Grandcourt
and
Gwendolen
,
when
what
he
desired
was
a
perfect
confidence
that
they
would
never
be
married
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
consented
willingly
that
Grandcourt
should
marry
an
heiress
,
or
that
he
should
marry
Mrs.
Glasher
:
in
the
one
match
there
would
have
been
the
immediate
abundance
that
prospective
heirship
could
not
supply
,
in
the
other
there
would
have
been
the
security
of
the
wife
's
gratitude
,
for
Lush
had
always
been
Mrs.
Glasher
's
friend
;
and
that
the
future
Mrs.
Grandcourt
should
not
be
socially
received
could
not
affect
his
private
comfort
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
have
minded
,
either
,
that
there
should
be
no
marriage
in
question
at
all
;
but
he
felt
himself
justified
in
doing
his
utmost
to
hinder
a
marriage
with
a
girl
who
was
likely
to
bring
nothing
but
trouble
to
her
husband
 
not
to
speak
of
annoyance
if
not
ultimate
injury
to
her
husband
's
old
companion
,
whose
future
Mr.
Lush
earnestly
wished
to
make
as
easy
as
possible
,
considering
that
he
had
well
deserved
such
compensation
for
leading
a
dog
's
life
,
though
that
of
a
dog
who
enjoyed
many
tastes
undisturbed
,
and
who
profited
by
a
large
establishment
.
<EOS>
He
wished
for
himself
what
he
felt
to
be
good
,
and
was
not
conscious
of
wishing
harm
to
any
one
else
;
unless
perhaps
it
were
just
now
a
little
harm
to
the
inconvenient
and
impertinent
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
But
the
easiest
-
humored
of
luxury
and
music
,
the
toad
-
eater
the
least
liable
to
nausea
,
must
be
expected
to
have
his
susceptibilities
.
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Lush
was
accustomed
to
be
treated
by
the
world
in
general
as
an
apt
,
agreeable
fellow
:
he
had
not
made
up
his
mind
to
be
insulted
by
more
than
one
person
.
  
<EOS>
With
this
imperfect
preparation
of
a
war
policy
,
Lush
was
awaiting
Grandcourt
's
arrival
,
doing
little
more
than
wondering
how
the
campaign
would
begin
.
<EOS>
The
first
day
Grandcourt
was
much
occupied
with
the
stables
,
and
amongst
other
things
he
ordered
a
groom
to
put
a
side
-
saddle
on
Criterion
and
let
him
review
the
horse
's
paces
.
<EOS>
This
marked
indication
of
purpose
set
Lush
on
considering
over
again
whether
he
should
incur
the
ticklish
consequences
of
speaking
first
,
while
he
was
still
sure
that
no
compromising
step
had
been
taken
;
and
he
rose
the
next
morning
<EOS>
almost
resolved
that
if
Grandcourt
seemed
in
as
good
a
humor
as
yesterday
and
entered
at
all
into
talk
,
he
would
let
drop
the
interesting
facts
about
Gwendolen
and
her
family
,
just
to
see
how
they
would
work
,
and
to
get
some
guidance
.
<EOS>
But
Grandcourt
did
not
enter
into
talk
,
and
in
answer
to
a
question
even
about
his
own
convenience
,
no
fish
could
have
maintained
a
more
unwinking
silence
.
<EOS>
After
he
had
read
his
letters
he
gave
various
orders
to
be
executed
or
transmitted
by
Lush
,
and
then
thrust
his
shoulder
toward
that
useful
person
,
who
accordingly
rose
to
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
But
before
he
was
out
of
the
door
Grandcourt
turned
his
head
slightly
and
gave
a
broken
,
languid
"
Oh
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
"
said
Lush
,
who
,
it
must
have
been
observed
,
did
not
take
his
dusty
puddings
with
a
respectful
air
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shut
the
door
,
will
you
?
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
speak
into
the
corridor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lush
closed
the
door
,
came
forward
,
and
chose
to
sit
down
.
  
<EOS>
After
a
little
pause
Grandcourt
said
,
"
Is
Miss
Harleth
at
Offendene
?
"
<EOS>
He
was
quite
certain
that
Lush
had
made
it
his
business
to
inquire
about
her
,
and
he
had
some
pleasure
in
thinking
that
Lush
did
not
want
_
him
_
to
inquire
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
hardly
know
,
"
said
Lush
,
carelessly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
family
's
utterly
done
up
.
<EOS>
They
and
the
Gascoignes
too
have
lost
all
their
money
.
<EOS>
It
's
owing
to
some
rascally
banking
business
.
<EOS>
The
poor
mother
has
n't
a
_
sou
_
,
it
seems
.
<EOS>
She
and
the
girls
have
to
huddle
themselves
into
a
little
cottage
like
a
laborer
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
lie
to
me
,
if
you
please
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
in
his
lowest
audible
tone
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
amusing
,
and
it
answers
no
other
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
said
Lush
,
more
nettled
than
was
common
with
him
 
<EOS>
the
prospect
before
him
being
more
than
commonly
disturbing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Just
tell
me
the
truth
,
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
no
invention
of
mine
.
<EOS>
I
have
heard
the
story
from
several
 
Bazley
,
Brackenshaw
's
man
,
for
one
.
<EOS>
He
is
getting
a
new
tenant
for
Offendene
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mean
that
.
<EOS>
Is
Miss
Harleth
there
,
or
is
she
not
?
"
<EOS>
said
Grandcourt
,
in
his
former
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
soul
,
I
ca
n't
tell
,
"
said
Lush
,
rather
sulkily
.
<EOS>
"
She
may
have
left
yesterday
.
<EOS>
I
heard
she
had
taken
a
situation
as
governess
;
she
may
be
gone
to
it
for
what
I
know
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
wanted
to
see
her
no
doubt
the
mother
would
send
for
her
back
.
<EOS>
"
This
sneer
slipped
off
his
tongue
without
strict
intention
.
  
<EOS>
"
Send
Hutchins
to
inquire
whether
she
will
be
there
tomorrow
.
<EOS>
"
Lush
did
not
move
.
<EOS>
Like
many
persons
who
have
thought
over
beforehand
what
they
shall
say
in
given
cases
,
he
was
impelled
by
an
unexpected
irritation
to
say
some
of
those
prearranged
things
before
the
cases
were
given
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
,
in
fact
,
was
likely
to
get
into
a
scrape
so
tremendous
that
it
was
impossible
to
let
him
take
the
first
step
toward
it
without
remonstrance
.
<EOS>
Lush
retained
enough
caution
to
use
a
tone
of
rational
friendliness
,
still
he
felt
his
own
value
to
his
patron
,
and
was
prepared
to
be
daring
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
as
well
for
you
to
remember
,
Grandcourt
,
that
you
are
coming
under
closer
fire
now
.
<EOS>
There
can
be
none
of
the
ordinary
flirting
done
,
which
may
mean
everything
or
nothing
.
<EOS>
You
must
make
up
your
mind
whether
you
wish
to
be
accepted
;
and
more
than
that
,
how
you
would
like
being
refused
.
<EOS>
Either
one
or
the
other
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
be
philandering
after
her
again
for
six
weeks
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
said
nothing
,
but
pressed
the
newspaper
down
on
his
knees
and
began
to
light
another
cigar
.
<EOS>
Lush
took
this
as
a
sign
that
he
was
willing
to
listen
,
and
was
the
more
bent
on
using
the
opportunity
;
he
wanted
,
if
possible
,
to
find
out
which
would
be
the
more
potent
cause
of
hesitation
 
probable
acceptance
or
probable
refusal
.
  
<EOS>
"
Everything
has
a
more
serious
look
now
than
it
had
before
.
<EOS>
There
is
her
family
to
be
provided
for
.
<EOS>
You
could
not
let
your
wife
's
mother
live
in
beggary
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
a
confoundedly
hampering
affair
.
<EOS>
Marriage
will
pin
you
down
in
a
way
you
have
n't
been
used
to
;
and
in
point
of
money
you
have
not
too
much
elbow
-
room
.
<EOS>
And
after
all
,
what
will
you
get
by
it
?
<EOS>
You
are
master
over
your
estates
,
present
or
future
,
<EOS>
as
far
as
choosing
your
heir
goes
;
it
's
a
pity
to
go
on
encumbering
them
for
a
mere
whim
,
which
you
may
repent
of
in
a
twelvemonth
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
sorry
to
see
you
making
a
mess
of
your
life
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
If
there
were
anything
solid
to
be
gained
by
the
marriage
,
that
would
be
a
different
affair
.
<EOS>
"
  
Lush
's
tone
had
gradually
become
more
and
more
unctuous
in
its
friendliness
of
remonstrance
,
and
he
was
almost
in
danger
of
forgetting
that
he
was
merely
gambling
in
argument
.
<EOS>
When
he
left
off
,
Grandcourt
took
his
cigar
out
of
his
mouth
,
and
looking
steadily
at
the
moist
end
while
he
adjusted
the
leaf
with
his
delicate
finger
-
tips
,
said
    
"
I
knew
before
that
you
had
an
objection
to
my
marrying
Miss
Harleth
.
<EOS>
"
Here
he
made
a
little
pause
before
he
continued
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
never
considered
that
a
reason
against
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
supposed
you
did
,
"
answered
Lush
,
not
unctuously
but
dryly
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
not
_
that
_
I
urged
as
a
reason
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
thought
it
might
have
been
a
reason
against
it
,
after
all
your
experience
,
that
you
would
be
acting
like
the
hero
of
a
ballad
,
and
making
yourself
absurd
 
and
all
for
what
?
<EOS>
You
know
you
could
n't
make
up
your
mind
before
.
<EOS>
It
's
impossible
you
can
care
much
about
her
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
the
tricks
she
is
likely
to
play
,
you
may
judge
of
that
from
what
you
heard
at
Leubronn
.
<EOS>
However
,
what
I
wished
to
point
out
to
you
was
,
that
there
can
be
no
shilly
-
shally
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Perfectly
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
looking
round
at
Lush
and
fixing
him
with
narrow
eyes
;
"
I
do
n't
intend
that
there
should
be
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
it
's
disagreeable
to
you
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
suppose
I
care
a
damn
for
that
you
are
most
stupendously
mistaken
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
well
,
"
said
Lush
,
rising
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
and
feeling
some
latent
venom
still
within
him
,
"
if
you
have
made
up
your
mind
!
 
<EOS>
only
there
's
another
aspect
of
the
affair
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
speaking
on
the
supposition
that
it
was
absolutely
certain
she
would
accept
you
,
and
that
destitution
would
have
no
choice
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
not
so
sure
that
the
young
lady
is
to
be
counted
on
.
<EOS>
She
is
kittle
cattle
to
shoe
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
And
she
had
her
reasons
for
running
away
before
.
<EOS>
"
Lush
had
moved
a
step
or
two
till
he
stood
nearly
in
front
of
Grandcourt
,
though
at
some
distance
from
him
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
feel
himself
much
restrained
by
consequences
,
being
aware
that
the
only
strong
hold
he
had
on
his
present
position
was
his
serviceableness
;
and
even
after
a
quarrel
the
want
of
him
was
likely
sooner
or
later
to
recur
.
<EOS>
He
foresaw
that
Gwendolen
would
cause
him
to
be
ousted
for
a
time
,
and
his
temper
at
this
moment
urged
him
to
risk
a
quarrel
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
had
her
reasons
,
"
he
repeated
more
significantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
come
to
that
conclusion
before
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
with
contemptuous
irony
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
but
I
hardly
think
you
know
what
her
reasons
were
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
,
apparently
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
not
betraying
by
so
much
as
an
eyelash
that
he
cared
for
the
reasons
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
you
had
better
know
too
,
that
you
may
judge
of
the
influence
you
have
over
her
if
she
swallows
her
reasons
and
accepts
you
.
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
I
would
take
odds
against
it
.
<EOS>
She
saw
Lydia
in
Cardell
Chase
and
heard
the
whole
story
.
"
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
made
no
immediate
answer
,
and
only
went
on
smoking
.
<EOS>
He
was
so
long
before
he
spoke
that
Lush
moved
about
and
looked
out
of
the
windows
,
unwilling
to
go
away
without
seeing
some
effect
of
his
daring
move
.
<EOS>
He
had
expected
that
Grandcourt
would
tax
him
with
having
contrived
the
affair
,
since
Mrs.
Glasher
was
then
living
at
Gadsmere
,
a
hundred
miles
off
,
and
he
was
prepared
to
admit
the
fact
:
what
he
cared
about
was
that
Grandcourt
should
be
staggered
by
the
sense
that
his
intended
advances
must
be
made
to
a
girl
who
had
that
knowledge
in
her
mind
and
had
been
scared
by
it
.
<EOS>
At
length
Grandcourt
,
seeing
Lush
turn
toward
him
,
looked
at
him
again
and
said
,
contemptuously
,
"
What
follows
?
"
  
<EOS>
Here
certainly
was
a
"
mate
"
in
answer
to
Lush
's
"
check
:
"
and
though
his
exasperation
with
Grandcourt
was
perhaps
stronger
than
it
had
ever
been
before
,
it
would
have
been
idiocy
to
act
as
if
any
further
move
could
be
useful
.
<EOS>
He
gave
a
slight
shrug
with
one
shoulder
,
and
was
going
to
walk
away
,
when
Grandcourt
,
turning
on
his
seat
toward
the
table
,
said
,
as
quietly
as
if
nothing
had
occurred
,
"
Oblige
me
by
pushing
that
pen
and
paper
here
,
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
No
thunderous
,
bullying
superior
could
have
exercised
the
imperious
spell
that
Grandcourt
did
.
<EOS>
Why
,
instead
of
being
obeyed
,
he
had
never
been
told
to
go
to
a
warmer
place
,
was
perhaps
a
mystery
to
those
who
found
themselves
obeying
him
.
<EOS>
The
pen
and
paper
were
pushed
to
him
,
and
as
he
took
them
<EOS>
he
said
,
"
Just
wait
for
this
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
scrawled
with
ease
,
and
the
brief
note
was
quickly
addressed
.
<EOS>
"
Let
Hutchins
go
with
it
at
once
,
will
you
?
"
said
Grandcourt
,
pushing
the
letter
away
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
As
Lush
had
expected
,
it
was
addressed
to
Miss
Harleth
,
Offendene
.
<EOS>
When
his
irritation
had
cooled
down
he
was
glad
there
had
been
no
explosive
quarrel
;
but
he
felt
sure
that
there
was
a
notch
made
against
him
,
and
that
somehow
or
other
he
was
intended
to
pay
.
<EOS>
It
was
also
clear
to
him
that
the
immediate
effect
of
his
revelation
had
been
to
harden
Grandcourt
's
previous
determination
.
<EOS>
But
as
to
the
particular
movements
that
made
this
process
in
his
baffling
mind
,
Lush
could
only
toss
up
his
chin
in
despair
of
a
theory
.
      
<EOS>
He
brings
white
asses
laden
with
the
freight
  
Of
Tyrian
vessels
,
purple
,
gold
and
balm
,
  
To
bribe
my
will
:
I
'll
bid
them
chase
him
forth
,
  
Nor
let
him
breathe
the
taint
of
his
surmise
  
<EOS>
On
my
secure
resolve
.
                         
<EOS>
Ay
,
'
tis
secure
:
  
<EOS>
And
therefore
let
him
come
to
spread
his
freight
.
  
<EOS>
For
firmness
hath
its
appetite
and
craves
  
The
stronger
lure
,
more
strongly
to
resist
;
  
Would
know
the
touch
of
gold
to
fling
it
off
;
  
Scent
wine
to
feel
its
lip
the
soberer
;
  
Behold
soft
byssus
,
ivory
,
and
plumes
  
<EOS>
To
say
,
"
They
're
fair
,
but
I
will
none
of
them
,
"
  
And
flout
Enticement
in
the
very

<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
one
day
came
to
Offendene
with
what
he
felt
to
be
the
satisfactory
news
that
Mrs.
Mompert
had
fixed
Tuesday
in
the
following
week
for
her
interview
with
Gwendolen
at
Wanchester
.
<EOS>
He
said
nothing
of
his
having
incidentally
heard
that
Mr.
Grandcourt
had
returned
to
Diplow
;
knowing
no
more
<EOS>
than
she
did
that
Leubronn
had
been
the
goal
of
her
admirer
's
journeying
,
and
feeling
that
it
would
be
unkind
uselessly
to
revive
the
memory
of
a
brilliant
prospect
under
the
present
reverses
.
<EOS>
In
his
secret
soul
he
thought
of
his
niece
's
unintelligible
caprice
with
regret
,
but
he
vindicated
her
to
himself
by
considering
that
Grandcourt
had
been
the
first
to
behave
oddly
,
in
suddenly
walking
away
when
there
had
the
best
opportunity
for
crowning
his
marked
attentions
.
<EOS>
The
rector
's
practical
judgment
told
him
that
his
chief
duty
to
his
niece
now
was
to
encourage
her
resolutely
to
face
the
change
in
her
lot
,
since
there
was
no
manifest
promise
of
any
event
that
would
avert
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
find
an
interest
in
varied
experience
,
my
dear
,
and
I
have
no
doubt
you
will
be
a
more
valuable
woman
for
having
sustained
such
a
part
as
you
are
called
to
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
pretend
to
believe
that
I
shall
like
it
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
for
the
first
time
showing
her
uncle
some
petulance
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
quite
aware
that
I
am
obliged
to
bear
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
remembered
having
submitted
to
his
admonition
on
a
different
occasion
when
she
was
expected
to
like
a
very
different
prospect
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
your
good
sense
will
teach
you
to
behave
suitably
under
it
,
"
said
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
with
a
shade
more
gravity
.
<EOS>
"
I
feel
sure
that
Mrs.
Mompert
will
be
pleased
with
you
.
<EOS>
You
will
know
how
to
conduct
yourself
to
a
woman
who
holds
in
all
senses
the
relation
of
a
superior
to
you
.
<EOS>
This
trouble
has
come
on
you
young
,
but
that
makes
it
in
some
respects
easier
,
and
there
is
a
benefit
in
all
chastisement
if
we
adjust
our
minds
to
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
precisely
what
Gwendolen
was
unable
to
do
;
and
after
her
uncle
was
gone
,
the
bitter
tears
,
which
had
rarely
come
during
the
late
trouble
,
rose
and
fell
slowly
as
she
sat
alone
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
denied
that
the
trouble
was
easier
because
she
was
young
.
<EOS>
When
was
she
to
have
any
happiness
,
if
it
did
not
come
while
she
was
young
?
<EOS>
Not
that
her
visions
of
possible
happiness
for
herself
were
as
unmixed
with
necessary
evil
as
they
used
to
be
 
not
that
she
could
still
imagine
herself
plucking
the
fruits
of
life
without
suspicion
of
their
core
.
<EOS>
But
this
general
disenchantment
with
the
world
 
nay
,
with
herself
,
since
it
appeared
that
she
was
not
made
for
easy
pre
-
eminence
 
only
intensified
her
sense
of
forlornness
;
it
was
a
visibly
sterile
distance
enclosing
the
dreary
path
at
her
feet
,
in
which
she
had
no
courage
to
tread
.
<EOS>
She
was
in
that
first
crisis
of
passionate
youthful
rebellion
against
what
is
not
fitly
called
pain
,
but
rather
the
absence
of
joy
 
that
first
rage
of
disappointment
in
life
's
morning
,
which
we
whom
the
years
have
subdued
are
apt
to
remember
but
dimly
as
part
of
our
own
experience
,
and
so
to
be
intolerant
of
its
self
-
enclosed
unreasonableness
and
impiety
.
<EOS>
What
passion
seems
more
absurd
,
when
we
have
got
outside
it
and
looked
at
calamity
as
a
collective
risk
,
than
this
amazed
anguish
that
I
and
not
Thou
,
He
or
She
,
should
be
just
the
smitten
one
?
<EOS>
Yet
perhaps
some
who
have
afterward
made
themselves
a
willing
fence
before
the
breast
of
another
,
and
have
carried
their
own
heart
-
wound
in
heroic
silence
 
<EOS>
some
who
have
made
their
deeds
great
,
nevertheless
began
with
this
angry
amazement
at
their
own
smart
,
and
on
the
mere
denial
of
their
fantastic
desires
raged
as
if
under
the
sting
of
wasps
which
reduced
the
universe
for
them
to
an
unjust
infliction
of
pain
.
<EOS>
This
was
nearly
poor
Gwendolen
's
condition
.
<EOS>
What
though
such
a
reverse
as
hers
had
often
happened
to
other
girls
?
<EOS>
The
one
point
she
had
been
all
her
life
learning
to
care
for
was
,
that
it
had
happened
to
_
<EOS>
her
_
:
<EOS>
it
was
what
_
<EOS>
she
_
felt
under
Klesmer
's
demonstration
that
she
was
not
remarkable
enough
to
command
fortune
by
force
of
will
and
merit
;
it
was
what
_
<EOS>
she
_
would
feel
under
the
rigors
of
Mrs.
Mompert
's
constant
expectation
,
under
the
dull
demand
that
she
should
be
cheerful
with
three
Miss
Momperts
,
under
the
necessity
of
showing
herself
entirely
submissive
,
and
keeping
her
thoughts
to
herself
.
<EOS>
To
be
a
queen
disthroned
is
not
so
hard
as
some
other
down
-
stepping
:
imagine
one
who
had
been
made
to
believe
in
his
own
divinity
finding
all
homage
withdrawn
,
and
himself
unable
to
perform
a
miracle
that
would
recall
the
homage
and
restore
his
own
confidence
.
<EOS>
Something
akin
to
this
illusion
and
this
helplessness
had
befallen
the
poor
spoiled
child
,
with
the
lovely
lips
and
eyes
and
the
majestic
figure
 
which
seemed
now
to
have
no
magic
in
them
.
  
<EOS>
She
rose
from
the
low
ottoman
where
she
had
been
sitting
purposeless
,
and
walked
up
and
down
the
drawing
-
room
,
resting
her
elbow
on
one
palm
while
she
leaned
down
her
cheek
on
the
other
,
and
a
slow
tear
fell
.
<EOS>
She
thought
,
"
I
have
always
,
ever
since
I
was
little
,
felt
that
mamma
was
not
a
happy
woman
;
and
now
I
dare
say
I
shall
be
more
unhappy
than
she
has
been
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
mind
dwelt
for
a
few
moments
on
the
picture
of
herself
losing
her
youth
and
ceasing
to
enjoy
 
not
minding
whether
she
did
this
or
that
:
but
such
picturing
inevitably
brought
back
the
image
of
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
mamma
!
<EOS>
it
will
be
still
worse
for
her
now
.
<EOS>
I
can
get
a
little
money
for
her
 
<EOS>
that
is
all
I
shall
care
about
now
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
with
an
entirely
new
movement
of
her
imagination
,
she
saw
her
mother
getting
quite
old
and
white
,
and
herself
no
longer
young
but
faded
,
and
their
two
faces
meeting
still
with
memory
and
love
,
and
she
knowing
what
was
in
her
mother
's
mind
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
Gwen
too
is
sad
and
faded
now
"
 
and
then
,
for
the
first
time
,
she
sobbed
,
not
in
anger
,
but
with
a
sort
of
tender
misery
.
  
<EOS>
Her
face
was
toward
the
door
,
and
she
saw
her
mother
enter
.
<EOS>
She
barely
saw
that
;
for
her
eyes
were
large
with
tears
,
and
she
pressed
her
handkerchief
against
them
hurriedly
.
<EOS>
Before
she
took
it
away
she
felt
her
mother
's
arms
round
her
,
and
this
sensation
,
which
seemed
a
prolongation
of
her
inward
vision
,
overcame
her
will
to
be
reticent
;
she
sobbed
anew
in
spite
of
herself
,
as
they
pressed
their
cheeks
together
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
had
brought
something
in
her
hand
which
had
already
caused
her
an
agitating
anxiety
,
and
she
dared
not
speak
until
her
darling
had
become
calmer
.
<EOS>
But
Gwendolen
,
with
whom
weeping
had
always
been
a
painful
manifestation
to
be
resisted
,
if
possible
,
again
pressed
her
handkerchief
against
her
eyes
,
and
,
with
a
deep
breath
,
drew
her
head
backward
and
looked
at
her
mother
,
who
was
pale
and
tremulous
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
nothing
,
mamma
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
thinking
that
her
mother
had
been
moved
in
this
way
simply
by
finding
her
in
distress
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
all
over
now
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Davilow
had
withdrawn
her
arms
,
and
Gwendolen
perceived
a
letter
in
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
that
letter
?
 
<EOS>
worse
news
still
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
,
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
you
will
think
it
,
dear
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
keeping
the
letter
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
hardly
guess
where
it
comes
from
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
ask
me
to
guess
anything
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
rather
impatiently
,
as
if
a
bruise
were
being
pressed
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
addressed
to
you
,
dear
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
gave
the
slightest
perceptible
toss
of
the
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
comes
from
Diplow
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
giving
her
the
letter
.
  
<EOS>
She
knew
Grandcourt
's
indistinct
handwriting
,
and
her
mother
was
not
surprised
to
see
her
blush
deeply
;
but
watching
her
as
she
read
,
and
wondering
much
what
was
the
purport
of
the
letter
<EOS>
,
she
saw
the
color
die
out
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
lips
even
were
pale
as
she
turned
the
open
note
toward
her
mother
.
<EOS>
The
words
were
few
and
formal
:
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Grandcourt
presents
his
compliments
to
Miss
Harleth
,
and
begs
to
know
whether
he
may
be
permitted
to
call
at
Offendene
tomorrow
after
two
and
to
see
her
alone
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grandcourt
has
just
returned
from
Leubronn
,
where
he
had
hoped
to
find
Miss
Harleth
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
read
,
and
then
looked
at
her
daughter
inquiringly
,
leaving
the
note
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
let
it
fall
to
the
floor
,
and
turned
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
answered
,
darling
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
timidly
.
<EOS>
"
The
man
waits
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
sank
on
the
settee
,
clasped
her
hands
,
and
looked
straight
before
her
,
not
at
her
mother
.
<EOS>
She
had
the
expression
of
one
who
had
been
startled
by
a
sound
and
was
listening
to
know
what
would
come
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
sudden
change
of
the
situation
was
bewildering
.
<EOS>
A
few
minutes
before
she
was
looking
along
an
inescapable
path
of
repulsive
monotony
,
with
hopeless
inward
rebellion
against
the
imperious
lot
which
left
her
no
choice
:
and
lo
,
now
,
a
moment
of
choice
was
come
.
<EOS>
Yet
 
was
it
triumph
<EOS>
she
felt
most
or
terror
?
<EOS>
Impossible
for
Gwendolen
not
to
feel
some
triumph
in
a
tribute
to
her
power
at
a
time
when
she
was
first
tasting
the
bitterness
of
insignificance
:
again
she
seemed
to
be
getting
a
sort
of
empire
over
her
own
life
.
<EOS>
But
how
to
use
it
?
<EOS>
Here
came
the
terror
.
<EOS>
Quick
,
quick
,
like
pictures
in
a
book
beaten
open
with
a
sense
of
hurry
,
came
back
vividly
,
yet
in
fragments
,
all
that
she
had
gone
through
in
relation
to
Grandcourt
 
<EOS>
the
allurements
,
the
vacillations
,
the
resolve
to
accede
,
the
final
repulsion
;
the
incisive
face
of
that
dark
-
eyed
lady
with
the
lovely
boy
:
her
own
pledge
(
was
it
a
pledge
not
to
marry
him
?
)
 
<EOS>
the
new
disbelief
in
the
worth
of
men
and
things
for
which
that
scene
of
disclosure
had
become
a
symbol
.
<EOS>
That
unalterable
experience
made
a
vision
at
which
in
the
first
agitated
moment
,
before
tempering
reflections
could
suggest
themselves
,
her
native
terror
shrank
.
  
<EOS>
Where
was
the
good
of
choice
coming
again
?
<EOS>
What
did
she
wish
?
<EOS>
Anything
different
?
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
And
yet
in
the
dark
seed
-
growths
of
consciousness
a
new
wish
was
forming
itself
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
had
never
known
it
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Something
,
anything
she
wished
for
that
would
have
saved
her
from
the
dread
to
let
Grandcourt
come
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
no
long
while
 
yet
it
seemed
long
to
Mrs.
Davilow
,
before
she
thought
it
well
to
say
,
gently
    
"
It
will
be
necessary
for
you
to
write
,
dear
.
<EOS>
Or
shall
I
write
an
answer
for
you
 
which
you
will
dictate
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
mamma
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
drawing
a
deep
breath
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
please
lay
me
out
the
pen
and
paper
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
That
was
gaining
time
.
<EOS>
Was
she
to
decline
Grandcourt
's
visit
 
close
the
shutters
 
not
even
look
out
on
what
would
happen
?
 
<EOS>
though
with
the
assurance
that
she
should
remain
just
where
she
was
?
<EOS>
The
young
activity
within
her
made
a
warm
current
through
her
terror
and
stirred
toward
something
that
would
be
an
event
 
toward
an
opportunity
in
which
she
could
look
and
speak
with
the
former
effectiveness
.
<EOS>
The
interest
of
the
morrow
was
no
longer
at
a
deadlock
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
really
no
reason
on
earth
why
you
should
be
so
alarmed
at
the
man
's
waiting
a
few
minutes
,
mamma
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
remonstrantly
,
as
Mrs.
Davilow
,
having
prepared
the
writing
materials
,
looked
toward
her
expectantly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Servants
expect
nothing
else
than
to
wait
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
I
must
write
on
the
instant
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
dear
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
in
the
tone
of
one
corrected
,
turning
to
sit
down
and
take
up
a
bit
of
work
that
lay
at
hand
;
"
he
can
wait
another
quarter
of
an
hour
,
if
you
like
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
If
was
very
simple
speech
and
action
on
her
part
,
but
it
was
what
might
have
been
subtly
calculated
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
felt
a
contradictory
desire
to
be
hastened
:
hurry
would
save
her
from
deliberate
choice
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
mean
him
to
wait
long
enough
for
that
needlework
to
be
finished
,
"
she
said
,
lifting
her
hands
to
stroke
the
backward
curves
of
her
hair
,
while
she
rose
from
her
seat
and
stood
still
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
you
do
n't
feel
able
to
decide
?
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
sympathizingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
_
must
_
decide
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
walking
to
the
writing
-
table
and
seating
herself
.
<EOS>
All
the
while
there
was
a
busy
undercurrent
in
her
,
like
the
thought
of
a
man
who
keeps
up
a
dialogue
while
he
is
considering
how
he
can
slip
away
.
<EOS>
Why
should
she
not
let
him
come
?
<EOS>
It
bound
her
to
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
to
Leubronn
after
her
:
of
course
he
meant
a
direct
unmistakable
renewal
of
the
suit
which
before
had
been
only
implied
.
<EOS>
What
then
?
<EOS>
She
could
reject
him
.
<EOS>
Why
was
she
to
deny
herself
the
freedom
of
doing
this
 
which
she
would
like
to
do
?
  
<EOS>
"
If
Mr.
Grandcourt
has
only
just
returned
from
Leubronn
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
observing
that
Gwendolen
leaned
back
in
her
chair
after
taking
the
pen
in
her
hand
 
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
he
has
heard
of
our
misfortunes
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
That
could
make
no
difference
to
a
man
in
his
position
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
rather
contemptuously
,
  
"
<EOS>
It
would
to
some
men
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
.
<EOS>
"
They
would
not
like
to
take
a
wife
from
a
family
in
a
state
of
beggary
almost
,
as
we
are
.
<EOS>
Here
we
are
at
Offendene
with
a
great
shell
over
us
,
as
usual
.
<EOS>
But
just
imagine
his
finding
us
at
Sawyer
's
Cottage
.
<EOS>
Most
men
are
afraid
of
being
bored
or
taxed
by
a
wife
's
family
.
<EOS>
If
Mr.
Grandcourt
did
know
,
I
think
it
a
strong
proof
of
his
attachment
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
spoke
with
unusual
emphasis
:
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
ventured
to
say
anything
about
Grandcourt
which
would
necessarily
seem
intended
as
an
argument
in
favor
of
him
,
her
habitual
impression
being
that
such
arguments
would
certainly
be
useless
and
might
be
worse
.
<EOS>
The
effect
of
her
words
now
was
stronger
than
she
could
imagine
.
<EOS>
They
raised
a
new
set
of
possibilities
in
Gwendolen
's
mind
 
a
vision
of
what
Grandcourt
might
do
for
her
mother
if
she
,
Gwendolen
,
did
 
what
she
was
not
going
to
do
.
<EOS>
She
was
so
moved
by
a
new
rush
of
ideas
that
,
like
one
conscious
of
being
urgently
called
away
,
she
felt
that
the
immediate
task
must
be
hastened
:
the
letter
must
be
written
,
else
it
might
be
endlessly
deferred
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
she
acted
in
a
hurry
,
as
she
had
wished
to
do
.
<EOS>
To
act
in
a
hurry
was
to
have
a
reason
for
keeping
away
from
an
absolute
decision
,
and
to
leave
open
as
many
issues
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
She
wrote
:
"
Miss
Harleth
presents
her
compliments
to
Mr.
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
She
will
be
at
home
after
two
o'clock
to
-
morrow
.
"
  
<EOS>
Before
addressing
the
note
she
said
,
"
Pray
ring
the
bell
,
mamma
,
if
there
is
any
one
to
answer
it
.
"
<EOS>
She
really
did
not
know
who
did
the
work
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
till
after
the
letter
had
been
taken
away
and
Gwendolen
had
risen
again
,
stretching
out
one
arm
and
then
resting
it
on
her
head
,
with
a
low
moan
which
had
a
sound
of
relief
in
it
,
that
Mrs.
Davilow
ventured
to
ask
    
"
What
did
you
say
,
Gwen
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
said
that
I
should
be
at
home
,
"
answered
Gwendolen
,
rather
loftily
.
<EOS>
Then
after
a
pause
,
"
You
must
not
expect
,
because
Mr.
Grandcourt
is
coming
,
that
anything
is
going
to
happen
,
mamma
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
allow
myself
to
expect
anything
,
dear
.
<EOS>
I
desire
you
to
follow
your
own
feeling
.
<EOS>
You
have
never
told
me
what
that
was
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
use
of
telling
?
"
said
Gwendolen
,
hearing
a
reproach
in
that
true
statement
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
have
anything
pleasant
to
tell
,
you
may
be
sure
I
will
tell
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
Mr.
Grandcourt
will
consider
that
you
have
already
accepted
him
,
in
allowing
him
to
come
.
<EOS>
His
note
tells
you
plainly
enough
that
he
is
coming
to
make
you
an
offer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
;
and
I
wish
to
have
the
pleasure
of
refusing
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
looked
up
in
wonderment
,
but
Gwendolen
implied
her
wish
not
to
be
questioned
further
by
saying
    
"
Put
down
that
detestable
needle
-
work
,
and
let
us
walk
in
the
avenue
.
<EOS>
I
am
stifled
.
"
      
<EOS>
Desire
has
trimmed
the
sails
,
and
Circumstance
  
Brings
but
the
breeze
to
fill
them
.
   
<EOS>
While
Grandcourt
on
his
beautiful
black
Yarico
,
the
groom
behind
him
on
Criterion
,
was
taking
the
pleasant
ride
from
Diplow
to
Offendene
,
Gwendolen
was
seated
before
the
mirror
while
her
mother
gathered
up
the
lengthy
mass
of
light
-
brown
hair
which
she
had
been
carefully
brushing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
gather
it
up
easily
and
make
a
coil
,
mamma
,
"
said
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
bring
you
some
ear
-
rings
,
Gwen
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
when
the
hair
was
adjusted
,
and
they
were
both
looking
at
the
reflection
in
the
glass
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
for
them
not
to
notice
that
the
eyes
looked
brighter
than
they
had
done
of
late
,
that
there
seemed
to
be
a
shadow
lifted
from
the
face
,
leaving
all
the
lines
once
more
in
their
placid
youthfulness
.
<EOS>
The
mother
drew
some
inference
that
made
her
voice
rather
cheerful
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
want
your
earrings
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
mamma
;
I
shall
not
wear
any
ornaments
,
and
I
shall
put
on
my
black
silk
.
<EOS>
Black
is
the
only
wear
when
one
is
going
to
refuse
an
offer
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
with
one
of
her
old
smiles
at
her
mother
,
while
she
rose
to
throw
off
her
dressing
-
gown
.
  
<EOS>
"
Suppose
the
offer
is
not
made
after
all
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
not
without
a
sly
intention
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
that
will
be
because
I
refuse
it
beforehand
,
"
said
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
It
comes
to
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
proud
little
toss
of
the
head
as
she
said
this
;
and
when
she
walked
down
-
stairs
in
her
long
black
robes
,
there
was
just
that
firm
poise
of
head
and
elasticity
of
form
which
had
lately
been
missing
,
as
in
a
parched
plant
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
thought
,
"
She
is
quite
herself
again
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
pleasure
in
his
coming
.
<EOS>
Can
her
mind
be
really
made
up
against
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
would
have
been
rather
angry
if
that
thought
had
been
uttered
;
perhaps
all
the
more
because
through
the
last
twenty
hours
,
with
a
brief
interruption
of
sleep
,
she
had
been
so
occupied
with
perpetually
alternating
images
and
arguments
for
and
against
the
possibility
of
her
marrying
Grandcourt
,
that
the
conclusion
which
she
had
determined
on
beforehand
ceased
to
have
any
hold
on
her
consciousness
:
the
alternate
dip
of
counterbalancing
thoughts
begotten
of
counterbalancing
desires
had
brought
her
into
a
state
in
which
no
conclusion
could
look
fixed
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
expressed
her
resolve
as
before
;
but
it
was
a
form
out
of
which
<EOS>
the
blood
had
been
sucked
 
no
more
a
part
of
quivering
life
than
the
"
God
's
will
be
done
"
of
one
who
is
eagerly
watching
chances
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
mean
to
accept
Grandcourt
;
from
the
first
moment
of
receiving
his
letter
she
had
meant
to
refuse
him
;
still
,
that
could
not
but
prompt
her
to
look
the
unwelcome
reasons
full
in
the
face
until
she
had
a
little
less
awe
of
them
,
could
not
hinder
her
imagination
from
filling
out
her
knowledge
in
various
ways
,
some
of
which
seemed
to
change
the
aspect
of
what
she
knew
.
<EOS>
By
dint
of
looking
at
a
dubious
object
with
a
constructive
imagination
,
who
can
give
it
twenty
different
shapes
.
<EOS>
Her
indistinct
grounds
of
hesitation
before
the
interview
at
the
Whispering
Stones
,
at
present
counted
for
nothing
;
they
were
all
merged
in
the
final
repulsion
.
<EOS>
If
it
had
not
been
for
that
day
in
Cardell
Chase
,
she
said
to
herself
now
,
there
would
have
been
no
obstacle
to
her
marrying
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
On
that
day
and
after
it
,
she
had
not
reasoned
and
balanced
;
she
had
acted
with
a
force
of
impulse
against
which
all
questioning
was
no
more
than
a
voice
against
a
torrent
.
<EOS>
The
impulse
had
come
 
not
only
from
her
maidenly
pride
and
jealousy
,
not
only
from
the
shock
of
another
woman
's
calamity
thrust
close
on
her
vision
,
but
 
from
her
dread
of
wrong
-
doing
,
which
was
vague
,
it
was
true
,
and
aloof
from
the
daily
details
of
her
life
,
but
not
the
less
strong
.
<EOS>
Whatever
was
accepted
as
consistent
with
being
a
lady
she
had
no
scruple
about
;
but
from
the
dim
region
of
what
was
called
disgraceful
,
wrong
,
guilty
,
she
shrunk
with
mingled
pride
and
terror
;
and
even
apart
from
shame
,
her
feeling
would
have
made
her
place
any
deliberate
injury
of
another
in
the
region
of
guilt
.
  
<EOS>
But
now
 
did
she
know
exactly
what
was
the
state
of
the
case
with
regard
to
Mrs.
Glasher
and
her
children
?
<EOS>
She
had
given
a
sort
of
promise
 
had
said
,
"
I
will
not
interfere
with
your
wishes
.
<EOS>
"
But
would
another
woman
who
married
Grandcourt
be
in
fact
the
decisive
obstacle
to
her
wishes
,
or
be
doing
her
and
her
boy
any
real
injury
?
<EOS>
Might
it
not
be
just
as
well
,
<EOS>
nay
better
,
that
Grandcourt
should
marry
?
<EOS>
For
what
could
not
a
woman
do
when
she
was
married
,
if
she
knew
how
to
assert
herself
?
<EOS>
Here
all
was
constructive
imagination
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
had
about
as
accurate
a
conception
of
marriage
 
that
is
to
say
,
of
the
mutual
influences
,
demands
,
duties
of
man
and
woman
in
the
state
of
matrimony
 
as
she
had
of
magnetic
currents
and
the
law
of
storms
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mamma
managed
badly
,
"
was
her
way
of
summing
up
what
she
had
seen
of
her
mother
's
experience
:
she
herself
would
manage
quite
differently
.
<EOS>
And
the
trials
of
matrimony
were
the
last
theme
into
which
Mrs.
Davilow
could
choose
to
enter
fully
with
this
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
what
mamma
and
my
uncle
would
say
if
they
knew
about
Mrs.
Glasher
!
"
thought
Gwendolen
in
her
inward
debating
;
not
that
she
could
imagine
herself
telling
them
,
even
if
she
had
not
felt
bound
to
silence
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
what
anybody
would
say
;
or
what
they
would
say
to
Mr.
Grandcourt
's
marrying
some
one
else
and
having
other
children
!
"
<EOS>
To
consider
what
"
anybody
"
would
say
,
was
to
be
released
from
the
difficulty
of
judging
where
everything
was
obscure
to
her
when
feeling
had
ceased
to
be
decisive
.
<EOS>
She
had
only
to
collect
her
memories
,
which
proved
to
her
that
"
anybody
"
regarded
the
illegitimate
children
as
more
rightfully
to
be
looked
shy
on
and
deprived
of
social
advantages
than
illegitimate
fathers
.
<EOS>
The
verdict
of
"
anybody
"
seemed
to
be
that
she
had
no
reason
to
concern
herself
greatly
on
behalf
of
Mrs.
Glasher
and
her
children
.
  
<EOS>
But
there
was
another
way
in
which
they
had
caused
her
concern
.
<EOS>
What
others
might
think
,
could
not
do
away
with
a
feeling
which
in
the
first
instance
would
hardly
be
too
strongly
described
as
indignation
and
loathing
that
she
should
have
been
expected
to
unite
herself
with
an
outworn
life
,
full
of
backward
secrets
which
must
have
been
more
keenly
felt
than
any
association
with
_
her
_
.
<EOS>
True
,
the
question
of
love
on
her
own
part
had
occupied
her
scarcely
at
all
in
relation
to
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
The
desirability
of
marriage
for
her
had
always
seemed
due
to
other
feeling
than
love
;
and
to
be
enamored
<EOS>
was
the
part
of
the
man
,
on
whom
the
advances
depended
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
had
found
no
objection
to
Grandcourt
's
way
of
being
enamored
before
she
had
had
that
glimpse
of
his
past
,
which
she
resented
as
if
it
had
been
a
deliberate
offense
against
her
.
<EOS>
His
advances
to
_
her
_
were
deliberate
,
and
she
felt
a
retrospective
disgust
for
them
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
other
men
's
lives
were
of
the
same
kind
 
full
of
secrets
which
made
the
ignorant
suppositions
of
the
women
they
wanted
to
marry
a
farce
at
which
they
were
laughing
in
their
sleeves
.
  
<EOS>
These
feelings
of
disgust
and
indignation
had
sunk
deep
;
and
though
other
troublous
experience
in
the
last
weeks
had
dulled
them
from
passion
into
remembrance
,
it
was
chiefly
their
reverberating
activity
which
kept
her
firm
to
the
understanding
with
herself
,
that
she
was
not
going
to
accept
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
meant
to
form
a
new
determination
;
she
had
only
been
considering
what
might
be
thought
or
said
.
<EOS>
If
anything
could
have
induced
her
to
change
,
it
would
have
been
the
prospect
of
making
all
things
easy
for
"
poor
mamma
:
"
that
,
she
admitted
,
was
a
temptation
.
<EOS>
But
no
!
<EOS>
she
was
going
to
refuse
him
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
thought
that
he
was
coming
to
be
refused
was
inspiriting
:
she
had
the
white
reins
in
her
hands
again
;
there
was
a
new
current
in
her
frame
,
reviving
her
from
the
beaten
-
down
consciousness
in
which
she
had
been
left
by
the
interview
with
Klesmer
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
now
going
to
crave
an
opinion
of
her
capabilities
;
she
was
going
to
exercise
her
power
.
  
<EOS>
Was
this
what
made
her
heart
palpitate
annoyingly
when
she
heard
the
horse
's
footsteps
on
the
gravel
?
 
<EOS>
when
Miss
Merry
,
who
opened
the
door
to
Grandcourt
,
came
to
tell
her
that
he
was
in
the
drawing
-
room
?
<EOS>
The
hours
of
preparation
and
the
triumph
of
the
situation
were
apparently
of
no
use
:
she
might
as
well
have
seen
Grandcourt
coming
suddenly
on
her
in
the
midst
of
her
despondency
.
<EOS>
While
walking
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
she
had
to
concentrate
all
her
energy
in
that
self
-
control
,
which
made
her
appear
gravely
gracious
 
as
she
gave
her
hand
to
him
,
and
answered
his
hope
that
she
was
quite
well
in
a
voice
as
low
and
languid
as
his
own
.
<EOS>
A
moment
afterward
,
when
they
were
both
of
them
seated
on
two
of
the
wreath
-
painted
chairs
 
Gwendolen
upright
with
downcast
eyelids
,
Grandcourt
about
two
yards
distant
,
leaning
one
arm
over
the
back
of
his
chair
and
looking
at
her
,
while
he
held
his
hat
in
his
left
hand
 
any
one
seeing
them
as
a
picture
would
have
concluded
that
they
were
in
some
stage
of
love
-
making
suspense
.
<EOS>
And
certainly
the
love
-
making
had
begun
<EOS>
:
she
already
felt
herself
being
wooed
by
this
silent
man
seated
at
an
agreeable
distance
,
with
the
subtlest
atmosphere
of
attar
of
roses
and
an
attention
bent
wholly
on
her
.
<EOS>
And
he
also
considered
himself
to
be
wooing
:
he
was
not
a
man
to
suppose
that
his
presence
carried
no
consequences
;
and
he
was
exactly
the
man
to
feel
the
utmost
piquancy
in
a
girl
whom
he
had
not
found
quite
calculable
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
disappointed
not
to
find
you
at
Leubronn
,
"
he
began
,
his
usual
broken
drawl
having
just
a
shade
of
amorous
languor
in
it
.
"
<EOS>
The
place
was
intolerable
without
you
.
<EOS>
A
mere
kennel
of
a
place
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
judge
what
it
would
be
without
myself
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
turning
her
eyes
on
him
,
with
some
recovered
sense
of
mischief
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
With
_
myself
<EOS>
I
like
it
well
enough
to
have
stayed
longer
,
if
I
could
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
obliged
to
come
home
on
account
of
family
troubles
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
very
cruel
of
you
to
go
to
Leubronn
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
taking
no
notice
of
the
troubles
,
on
which
Gwendolen
 
she
hardly
knew
why
 
wished
that
there
should
be
a
clear
understanding
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
known
that
it
would
spoil
everything
:
you
knew
you
were
the
heart
and
soul
of
everything
that
went
on
.
<EOS>
Are
you
quite
reckless
about
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
would
be
impossible
to
say
"
yes
"
in
a
tone
that
would
be
taken
seriously
;
equally
impossible
to
say
"
no
;
"
but
what
else
could
she
say
?
<EOS>
In
her
difficulty
,
she
turned
down
her
eyelids
again
and
blushed
over
face
and
neck
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
saw
her
in
a
new
phase
,
and
believed
that
she
was
showing
her
inclination
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
determined
that
she
should
show
it
more
decidedly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
there
is
some
deeper
interest
?
<EOS>
Some
attraction
 
<EOS>
some
engagement
 
which
it
would
have
been
only
fair
to
make
me
aware
of
?
<EOS>
Is
there
any
man
who
stands
between
us
?
"
  
<EOS>
Inwardly
the
answer
framed
itself
.
"
<EOS>
No
;
but
there
is
a
woman
.
"
<EOS>
Yet
how
could
she
utter
this
?
<EOS>
Even
if
she
had
not
promised
that
woman
to
be
silent
,
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
her
to
enter
on
the
subject
with
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
But
how
could
she
arrest
his
wooing
by
beginning
to
make
a
formal
speech
 
<EOS>
"
I
perceive
your
intention
 
it
is
most
flattering
,
etc
.
"
?
<EOS>
A
fish
honestly
invited
to
come
and
be
eaten
has
a
clear
course
in
declining
,
but
how
if
it
finds
itself
swimming
against
a
net
?
<EOS>
And
apart
from
the
network
,
would
she
have
dared
at
once
to
say
anything
decisive
?
<EOS>
Gwendolen
had
not
time
to
be
clear
on
that
point
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
she
felt
compelled
to
silence
,
and
after
a
pause
,
Grandcourt
said
    
"
Am
I
to
understand
that
some
one
else
is
preferred
?
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
now
impatient
of
her
own
embarrassment
,
determined
to
rush
at
the
difficulty
and
free
herself
.
<EOS>
She
raised
her
eyes
again
and
said
with
something
of
her
former
clearness
and
defiance
,
"
No
"
 
wishing
him
to
understand
,
"
<EOS>
What
then
?
<EOS>
I
may
not
be
ready
to
take
_
<EOS>
you
_
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
nothing
that
Grandcourt
could
not
understand
which
he
perceived
likely
to
affect
his
_
amour
propre
_
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
last
thing
I
would
do
,
is
to
importune
you
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
hope
to
win
you
by
making
myself
a
bore
.
<EOS>
If
there
were
no
hope
for
me
,
I
would
ask
you
to
tell
me
so
at
once
,
that
I
might
just
ride
away
to
 
no
matter
where
.
"
  
<EOS>
Almost
to
her
own
astonishment
,
Gwendolen
felt
a
sudden
alarm
at
the
image
of
Grandcourt
finally
riding
away
.
<EOS>
What
would
be
left
her
then
?
<EOS>
Nothing
but
the
former
dreariness
.
<EOS>
She
liked
him
to
be
there
.
<EOS>
She
snatched
at
the
subject
that
would
defer
any
decisive
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
fear
you
are
not
aware
of
what
has
happened
to
us
.
<EOS>
I
have
lately
had
to
think
so
much
of
my
mamma
's
troubles
,
that
other
subjects
have
been
quite
thrown
into
the
background
.
<EOS>
She
has
lost
all
her
fortune
,
and
we
are
going
to
leave
this
place
.
<EOS>
I
must
ask
you
to
excuse
my
seeming
preoccupied
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
eluding
a
direct
appeal
Gwendolen
recovered
some
of
her
self
-
possession
.
<EOS>
She
spoke
with
dignity
and
looked
straight
at
Grandcourt
,
whose
long
,
narrow
,
impenetrable
eyes
met
hers
,
and
mysteriously
arrested
them
:
mysteriously
;
for
the
subtly
-
varied
drama
between
man
and
woman
is
often
such
as
can
hardly
be
rendered
in
words
put
together
like
dominoes
,
according
to
obvious
fixed
marks
.
<EOS>
The
word
of
all
work
,
Love
,
will
no
more
express
the
myriad
modes
of
mutual
attraction
,
than
the
word
Thought
can
inform
you
what
is
passing
through
your
neighbor
's
mind
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
hard
to
tell
on
which
side
 
Gwendolen
's
or
Grandcourt
's
 
the
influence
was
more
mixed
.
<EOS>
At
that
moment
his
strongest
wish
was
to
be
completely
master
of
this
creature
 
<EOS>
this
piquant
combination
of
maidenliness
and
mischief
:
that
she
knew
things
which
had
made
her
start
away
from
him
,
spurred
him
to
triumph
over
that
repugnance
;
and
he
was
believing
that
he
should
triumph
.
<EOS>
And
she
 
ah
,
piteous
equality
in
the
need
to
dominate
!
 
<EOS>
she
was
overcome
like
the
thirsty
one
who
is
drawn
toward
the
seeming
water
in
the
desert
,
overcome
by
the
suffused
sense
that
here
in
this
man
's
homage
to
her
lay
the
rescue
from
helpless
subjection
to
an
oppressive
lot
.
  
<EOS>
All
the
while
they
were
looking
at
each
other
;
and
Grandcourt
said
,
slowly
and
languidly
,
as
if
it
were
of
no
importance
,
other
things
having
been
settled
    
<EOS>
"
You
will
tell
me
now
,
I
hope
,
that
Mrs.
Davilow
's
loss
of
fortune
will
not
trouble
you
further
.
<EOS>
You
will
trust
me
to
prevent
it
from
weighing
upon
her
.
<EOS>
You
will
give
me
the
claim
to
provide
against
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
little
pauses
and
refined
drawlings
with
which
this
speech
was
uttered
,
gave
time
for
Gwendolen
to
go
through
the
dream
of
a
life
.
<EOS>
As
the
words
penetrated
her
,
they
had
the
effect
of
a
draught
of
wine
,
which
suddenly
makes
all
things
easier
,
desirable
things
not
so
wrong
,
and
people
in
general
less
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
momentary
phantasmal
love
for
this
man
who
chose
his
words
so
well
,
and
who
was
a
mere
incarnation
of
delicate
homage
.
<EOS>
Repugnance
,
dread
,
scruples
 
<EOS>
these
were
dim
as
remembered
pains
,
while
she
was
already
tasting
relief
under
the
immediate
pain
of
hopelessness
.
<EOS>
She
imagined
herself
already
springing
to
her
mother
,
and
being
playful
again
.
<EOS>
Yet
when
Grandcourt
had
ceased
to
speak
,
there
was
an
instant
in
which
she
was
conscious
of
being
at
the
turning
of
the
ways
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
generous
,
"
she
said
,
not
moving
her
eyes
,
and
speaking
with
a
gentle
intonation
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
accept
what
will
make
such
things
a
matter
of
course
?
"
said
Grandcourt
,
without
any
new
eagerness
.
<EOS>
"
You
consent
to
become
my
wife
?
"
  
<EOS>
This
time
Gwendolen
remained
quite
pale
.
<EOS>
Something
made
her
rise
from
her
seat
in
spite
of
herself
and
walk
to
a
little
distance
.
<EOS>
Then
she
turned
and
with
her
hands
folded
before
her
stood
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
immediately
rose
too
,
resting
his
hat
on
the
chair
,
but
still
keeping
hold
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
evident
hesitation
of
this
destitute
girl
to
take
his
splendid
offer
stung
him
into
a
keenness
of
interest
such
as
he
had
not
known
for
years
.
<EOS>
None
the
less
because
he
attributed
her
hesitation
entirely
to
her
knowledge
about
Mrs.
Glasher
.
<EOS>
In
that
attitude
of
preparation
,
he
said
    
"
Do
you
command
me
to
go
?
"
<EOS>
No
familiar
spirit
could
have
suggested
to
him
more
effective
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
let
him
go
:
that
negative
was
a
clutch
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
herself
to
be
,
after
all
,
only
drifted
toward
the
tremendous
decision
 
but
drifting
depends
on
something
besides
the
currents
when
the
sails
have
been
set
beforehand
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
accept
my
devotion
?
"
said
Grandcourt
,
holding
his
hat
by
his
side
and
looking
straight
into
her
eyes
,
without
other
movement
.
<EOS>
Their
eyes
meeting
in
that
way
seemed
to
allow
any
length
of
pause
:
but
wait
as
long
as
she
would
,
how
could
she
contradict
herself
!
<EOS>
What
had
she
detained
him
for
?
<EOS>
He
had
shut
out
any
explanation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
came
as
gravely
from
Gwendolen
's
lips
as
if
she
had
been
answering
to
her
name
in
a
court
of
justice
.
<EOS>
He
received
it
gravely
,
and
they
still
looked
at
each
other
in
the
same
attitude
.
<EOS>
Was
there
ever
such
a
way
before
of
accepting
the
bliss
-
giving
"
Yes
"
?
<EOS>
Grandcourt
liked
better
to
be
at
that
distance
from
her
,
and
to
feel
under
a
ceremony
imposed
by
an
indefinable
prohibition
that
breathed
from
Gwendolen
's
bearing
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
did
at
length
lay
down
his
hat
and
advance
to
take
her
hand
,
just
pressing
his
lips
upon
it
and
letting
it
go
again
.
<EOS>
She
thought
his
behavior
perfect
,
and
gained
a
sense
of
freedom
which
made
her
almost
ready
to
be
mischievous
.
<EOS>
Her
"
Yes
"
entailed
so
little
at
this
moment
that
there
was
nothing
to
screen
the
reversal
of
her
gloomy
prospects
;
her
vision
was
filled
by
her
own
release
from
the
Momperts
,
and
her
mother
's
release
from
Sawyer
's
Cottage
.
<EOS>
With
a
happy
curl
of
the
lips
,
she
said
    
"
Will
you
not
see
mamma
?
<EOS>
I
will
fetch
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
wait
a
little
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
in
his
favorite
attitude
,
having
his
left
forefinger
and
thumb
in
his
waist
-
coat
pocket
,
and
with
his
right
hand
caressing
his
whisker
,
while
he
stood
near
Gwendolen
and
looked
at
her
 
not
unlike
a
gentleman
who
has
a
felicitous
introduction
at
an
evening
party
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
anything
else
to
say
to
me
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
playfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
 
I
know
having
things
said
to
you
is
a
great
bore
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
rather
sympathetically
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
when
they
are
things
I
like
to
hear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
it
bother
you
to
be
asked
how
soon
we
can
be
married
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
will
,
to
-
day
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
putting
up
her
chin
saucily
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
to
-
day
,
then
,
but
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Think
of
it
before
I
come
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
In
a
fortnight
 
or
three
weeks
 
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
you
think
you
will
be
tired
of
my
company
,
"
said
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
I
notice
when
people
are
married
the
husband
is
not
so
much
with
his
wife
as
when
they
are
engaged
.
<EOS>
But
perhaps
I
shall
like
that
better
,
too
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
laughed
charmingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
whatever
you
like
,
"
said
Grandcourt
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
nothing
that
I
do
n't
like
?
 
<EOS>
please
say
that
;
because
I
think
I
dislike
what
I
do
n't
like
more
than
I
like
what
I
like
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
finding
herself
in
the
woman
's
paradise
,
where
all
her
nonsense
is
adorable
.
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
paused
;
these
were
subtilties
in
which
he
had
much
experience
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
 
this
is
such
a
brute
of
a
world
,
things
are
always
turning
up
that
one
does
n't
like
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
always
hinder
your
being
bored
.
<EOS>
If
you
like
to
ride
Criterion
,
I
ca
n't
hinder
his
coming
down
by
some
chance
or
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
my
friend
Criterion
,
how
is
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
outside
:
I
made
the
groom
ride
him
,
that
you
might
see
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
the
side
-
saddle
on
for
an
hour
or
two
yesterday
.
<EOS>
Come
to
the
window
and
look
at
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
could
see
the
two
horses
being
taken
slowly
round
the
sweep
,
and
the
beautiful
creatures
,
in
their
fine
grooming
,
sent
a
thrill
of
exultation
through
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
They
were
the
symbols
of
command
and
luxury
,
in
delightful
contrast
with
the
ugliness
of
poverty
and
humiliation
at
which
she
had
lately
been
looking
close
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
ride
Criterion
to
-
morrow
?
"
said
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
,
everything
shall
be
arranged
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
it
of
all
things
,
"
said
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
lose
myself
in
a
gallop
again
.
<EOS>
But
now
I
must
go
and
fetch
mamma
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Take
my
arm
to
the
door
,
then
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
and
she
accepted
.
<EOS>
Their
faces
were
very
near
each
other
,
being
almost
on
a
level
,
and
he
was
looking
at
her
.
<EOS>
She
thought
his
manners
as
a
lover
more
agreeable
than
any
she
had
seen
described
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
alarm
lest
he
meant
to
kiss
her
,
and
was
so
much
at
her
ease
,
that
she
suddenly
paused
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
said
half
archly
,
half
earnestly
    
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
while
I
think
of
it
 
there
is
something
I
dislike
that
you
can
save
me
from
.
<EOS>
I
do
_
not
_
like
Mr.
Lush
's
company
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
have
it
.
<EOS>
I
'll
get
rid
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
fond
of
him
yourself
?
"
  
"
Not
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
I
let
him
hang
on
me
because
he
has
always
been
a
poor
devil
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
in
an
_
adagio
_
of
utter
indifference
.
<EOS>
"
They
got
him
to
travel
with
me
when
I
was
a
lad
.
<EOS>
He
was
always
that
coarse
-
haired
kind
of
brute
 
sort
of
cross
between
a
hog
and
a
_
dilettante
_
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
laughed
.
<EOS>
All
that
seemed
kind
and
natural
enough
:
Grandcourt
's
fastidiousness
enhanced
the
kindness
.
<EOS>
And
when
they
reached
the
door
,
his
way
of
opening
it
for
her
was
the
perfection
of
easy
homage
.
<EOS>
Really
,
she
thought
,
he
was
likely
to
be
the
least
disagreeable
of
husbands
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
was
waiting
anxiously
in
her
bed
-
room
when
Gwendolen
entered
,
stepped
toward
her
quickly
,
and
kissing
her
on
both
cheeks
<EOS>
said
in
a
low
tone
,
"
Come
down
,
mamma
,
and
see
Mr.
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
I
am
engaged
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
darling
child
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
with
a
surprise
that
was
rather
solemn
than
glad
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
in
the
same
tone
,
and
with
a
quickness
which
implied
that
it
was
needless
to
ask
questions
.
<EOS>
"
Everything
is
settled
.
<EOS>
You
are
not
going
to
Sawyer
's
Cottage
,
I
am
not
going
to
be
inspected
by
Mrs.
Mompert
,
and
everything
is
to
be
as
I
like
.
<EOS>
So
come
down
with
me
immediately
.

LA
ROCHEFOUCAULD
.
"
   
<EOS>
An
hour
after
Grandcourt
had
left
,
the
important
news
of
Gwendolen
's
engagement
was
known
at
the
rectory
,
and
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gascoigne
,
with
Anna
,
spent
the
evening
at
Offendene
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
let
me
congratulate
you
on
having
created
a
strong
attachment
,
"
said
the
rector
.
<EOS>
"
You
look
serious
,
and
I
do
n't
wonder
at
it
:
a
lifelong
union
is
a
solemn
thing
.
<EOS>
But
from
the
way
Mr.
Grandcourt
has
acted
and
spoken
I
think
we
may
already
see
some
good
arising
out
of
our
adversity
.
<EOS>
It
has
given
you
an
opportunity
of
observing
your
future
husband
's
delicate
liberality
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
referred
to
Grandcourt
's
mode
of
implying
that
he
would
provide
for
Mrs.
Davilow
 
a
part
of
the
love
-
making
which
Gwendolen
had
remembered
to
cite
to
her
mother
with
perfect
accuracy
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
no
doubt
that
Mr.
Grandcourt
would
have
behaved
quite
as
handsomely
if
you
had
not
gone
away
to
Germany
,
Gwendolen
,
and
had
been
engaged
to
him
,
as
you
no
doubt
might
have
been
,
more
than
a
month
ago
,
"
said
Mrs.
Gascoigne
,
feeling
that
she
had
to
discharge
a
duty
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
But
now
there
is
no
more
room
for
caprice
;
indeed
,
I
trust
you
have
no
inclination
to
any
.
<EOS>
A
woman
has
a
great
debt
of
gratitude
to
a
man
who
perseveres
in
making
her
such
an
offer
.
<EOS>
But
no
doubt
you
feel
properly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
at
all
sure
that
I
do
,
aunt
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
with
saucy
gravity
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
everything
it
is
proper
to
feel
on
being
engaged
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
rector
patted
her
shoulder
and
smiled
as
at
a
bit
of
innocent
naughtiness
,
and
his
wife
took
his
behavior
as
an
indication
that
she
was
not
to
be
displeased
.
<EOS>
As
for
Anna
,
she
kissed
Gwendolen
and
said
,
"
I
do
hope
you
will
be
happy
,
"
but
then
sank
into
the
background
and
tried
to
keep
the
tears
back
too
.
<EOS>
In
the
late
days
she
had
been
imagining
a
little
romance
about
Rex
 
<EOS>
how
if
he
still
longed
for
Gwendolen
her
heart
might
be
softened
by
trouble
into
love
,
so
that
they
could
by
-
and
-
by
be
married
.
<EOS>
And
the
romance
had
turned
to
a
prayer
that
she
,
Anna
,
might
be
able
to
rejoice
like
a
good
sister
,
and
only
think
of
being
useful
in
working
for
Gwendolen
,
as
long
as
Rex
was
not
rich
.
<EOS>
But
now
she
wanted
grace
to
rejoice
in
something
else
.
<EOS>
Miss
Merry
and
the
four
girls
,
Alice
with
the
high
shoulders
,
Bertha
and
Fanny
the
whisperers
,
and
Isabel
the
listener
,
were
all
present
on
this
family
occasion
,
when
everything
seemed
appropriately
turning
to
the
honor
and
glory
of
Gwendolen
,
and
real
life
was
as
interesting
as
"
Sir
Charles
Grandison
.
<EOS>
"
The
evening
passed
chiefly
in
decisive
remarks
from
the
rector
,
in
answer
to
conjectures
from
the
two
elder
ladies
.
<EOS>
According
to
him
,
the
case
was
not
one
in
which
he
could
think
it
his
duty
to
mention
settlements
:
everything
must
,
and
doubtless
would
safely
be
left
to
Mr.
Grandcourt
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
know
exactly
what
sort
of
places
<EOS>
Ryelands
and
Gadsmere
are
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gadsmere
,
I
believe
,
is
a
secondary
place
,
"
said
Mr.
Gascoigne
;
"
But
<EOS>
Ryelands
I
know
to
be
one
of
our
finest
seats
.
<EOS>
The
park
is
extensive
and
the
woods
of
a
very
valuable
order
.
<EOS>
The
house
was
built
by
Inigo
Jones
,
and
the
ceilings
are
painted
in
the
Italian
style
.
<EOS>
The
estate
is
said
to
be
worth
twelve
thousand
a
year
,
and
there
are
two
livings
,
one
a
rectory
,
in
the
gift
of
the
Grandcourts
.
<EOS>
There
may
be
some
burdens
on
the
land
.
<EOS>
Still
,
Mr.
Grandcourt
was
an
only
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
most
remarkable
,
"
said
Mrs.
Gascoigne
,
"
if
he
were
to
become
Lord
Stannery
in
addition
to
everything
else
.
<EOS>
Only
think
:
there
is
the
Grandcourt
estate
,
the
Mallinger
estate
,
_
and
_
the
baronetcy
,
_
and
_
<EOS>
the
peerage
,
"
 
<EOS>
she
was
marking
off
the
items
on
her
fingers
,
and
paused
on
the
fourth
while
she
added
,
"
but
they
say
there
will
be
no
land
coming
to
him
with
the
peerage
.
<EOS>
"
It
seemed
a
pity
there
was
nothing
for
the
fifth
finger
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
peerage
,
"
said
the
rector
,
judiciously
,
"
must
be
regarded
as
a
remote
chance
.
<EOS>
There
are
two
cousins
between
the
present
peer
and
Mr.
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
It
is
certainly
a
serious
reflection
how
death
and
other
causes
do
sometimes
concentrate
inheritances
on
one
man
.
<EOS>
But
an
excess
of
that
kind
is
to
be
deprecated
.
<EOS>
To
be
Sir
Mallinger
Grandcourt
Mallinger
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
that
will
be
his
style
 
with
corresponding
properties
,
is
a
valuable
talent
enough
for
any
man
to
have
committed
to
him
.
<EOS>
Let
us
hope
it
will
be
well
used
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
a
position
for
the
wife
,
Gwendolen
!
"
said
Mrs.
Gascoigne
;
"
a
great
responsibility
indeed
.
<EOS>
But
you
must
lose
no
time
in
writing
to
Mrs.
Mompert
,
Henry
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
good
thing
that
you
have
an
engagement
of
marriage
to
offer
as
an
excuse
,
else
she
might
feel
offended
.
<EOS>
She
is
rather
a
high
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
rid
of
that
horror
,
"
thought
Gwendolen
,
to
whom
the
name
of
Mompert
had
become
a
sort
of
Mumbo
-
jumbo
.
<EOS>
She
was
very
silent
through
the
evening
,
and
that
night
could
hardly
sleep
at
all
in
her
little
white
bed
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
rarity
in
her
strong
youth
to
be
wakeful
:
and
perhaps
a
still
greater
rarity
for
her
to
be
careful
that
her
mother
should
not
know
of
her
restlessness
.
<EOS>
But
her
state
of
mind
was
altogether
new
:
she
who
had
been
used
to
feel
sure
of
herself
,
and
ready
to
manage
others
,
had
just
taken
a
decisive
step
which
she
had
beforehand
thought
that
she
would
not
take
 
nay
,
<EOS>
perhaps
,
was
bound
not
to
take
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
go
backward
now
;
she
liked
a
great
deal
of
what
lay
before
her
;
and
there
was
nothing
for
her
to
like
if
she
went
back
.
<EOS>
But
her
resolution
was
dogged
by
the
shadow
of
that
previous
resolve
which
had
at
first
come
as
the
undoubting
movement
of
her
whole
being
.
<EOS>
While
she
lay
on
her
pillow
with
wide
-
open
eyes
,
"
looking
on
darkness
which
the
blind
do
see
,
"
she
was
appalled
by
the
idea
that
she
was
going
to
do
what
she
had
once
started
away
from
with
repugnance
.
<EOS>
It
was
new
to
her
that
a
question
of
right
or
wrong
in
her
conduct
should
rouse
her
terror
;
she
had
known
no
compunction
that
atoning
caresses
and
presents
could
not
lay
to
rest
.
<EOS>
But
here
had
come
a
moment
when
something
like
a
new
consciousness
was
awaked
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
on
the
edge
of
adopting
deliberately
,
as
a
notion
for
all
the
rest
of
her
life
,
what
she
had
rashly
said
in
her
bitterness
,
when
her
discovery
had
driven
her
away
to
Leubronn
:
 
that
it
did
not
signify
what
she
did
;
she
had
only
to
amuse
herself
as
best
she
could
.
<EOS>
That
lawlessness
,
that
casting
away
of
all
care
for
justification
,
suddenly
frightened
her
:
it
came
to
her
with
the
shadowy
array
of
possible
calamity
behind
it
 
calamity
which
had
ceased
to
be
a
mere
name
for
her
;
and
all
the
infiltrated
influences
of
disregarded
religious
teaching
,
as
well
as
the
deeper
impressions
of
something
awful
and
inexorable
enveloping
her
,
seemed
to
concentrate
themselves
in
the
vague
conception
of
avenging
power
.
<EOS>
The
brilliant
position
she
had
longed
for
,
the
imagined
freedom
she
would
create
for
herself
in
marriage
,
the
deliverance
from
the
dull
insignificance
of
her
girlhood
 
all
immediately
before
her
;
and
yet
they
had
come
to
her
hunger
like
food
with
the
taint
of
sacrilege
upon
it
,
which
she
must
snatch
with
terror
.
<EOS>
In
the
darkness
and
loneliness
of
her
little
bed
,
her
more
resistant
self
could
not
act
against
the
first
onslaught
of
dread
after
her
irrevocable
decision
.
<EOS>
That
unhappy
-
faced
woman
and
her
children
 
Grandcourt
and
his
relations
with
her
 
kept
repeating
themselves
in
her
imagination
like
the
clinging
memory
of
a
disgrace
,
and
gradually
obliterated
all
other
thought
,
leaving
only
the
consciousness
that
she
had
taken
those
scenes
into
her
life
.
<EOS>
Her
long
wakefulness
seemed
a
delirium
;
a
faint
,
faint
light
penetrated
beside
the
window
-
curtain
;
the
chillness
increased
.
<EOS>
She
could
bear
it
no
longer
,
and
cried
"
Mamma
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
dear
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
immediately
,
in
a
wakeful
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
come
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
soon
went
to
sleep
on
her
mother
's
shoulder
,
and
slept
on
till
late
,
when
,
dreaming
of
a
lit
-
up
ball
-
room
,
she
opened
her
eyes
on
her
mother
standing
by
the
bedside
with
a
small
packet
in
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
wake
you
,
darling
,
but
I
thought
it
better
to
give
you
this
at
once
.
<EOS>
The
groom
has
brought
Criterion
;
he
has
come
on
another
horse
,
and
says
he
is
to
stay
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
sat
up
in
bed
and
opened
the
packet
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
delicate
enameled
casket
,
and
inside
was
a
splendid
diamond
ring
with
a
letter
which
contained
a
folded
bit
of
colored
paper
and
these
words
:
        
<EOS>
Pray
wear
this
ring
when
I
come
at
twelve
in
sign
of
our
betrothal
.
<EOS>
I
    
enclose
a
check
drawn
in
the
name
of
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
for
immediate
    
expenses
.
<EOS>
Of
course
Mrs.
Davilow
will
remain
at
Offendene
,
at
least
    
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
I
hope
,
when
I
come
,
you
will
have
granted
me
an
early
    
day
,
when
you
may
begin
to
command
me
at
a
shorter
distance
.
      
<EOS>
Yours
devotedly
,
      
H.
M.
GRANDCOURT
.
  
<EOS>
The
check
was
for
five
hundred
pounds
,
and
Gwendolen
turned
it
toward
her
mother
,
with
the
letter
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
very
kind
and
delicate
!
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
with
much
feeling
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
I
really
should
like
better
not
to
be
dependent
on
a
son
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
I
and
the
girls
could
get
along
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mamma
,
if
you
say
that
again
,
I
will
not
marry
him
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
angrily
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
child
,
I
trust
you
are
not
going
to
marry
only
for
my
sake
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
depreciatingly
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
tossed
her
head
on
the
pillow
away
from
her
mother
,
and
let
the
ring
lie
.
<EOS>
She
was
irritated
at
this
attempt
to
take
away
a
motive
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
deeper
cause
of
her
irritation
was
the
consciousness
that
she
was
not
going
to
marry
solely
for
her
mamma
's
sake
 
that
she
was
drawn
toward
the
marriage
in
ways
<EOS>
against
which
stronger
reasons
than
her
mother
's
renunciation
were
yet
not
strong
enough
to
hinder
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
waked
up
to
the
signs
that
she
was
irrevocably
engaged
,
and
all
the
ugly
visions
,
the
alarms
,
the
arguments
of
the
night
,
must
be
met
by
daylight
,
in
which
probably
they
would
show
themselves
weak
.
<EOS>
"
What
I
long
for
is
your
happiness
,
dear
,
"
continued
Mrs.
Davilow
,
pleadingly
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
say
anything
to
vex
you
.
<EOS>
Will
you
not
put
on
the
ring
?
"
  
<EOS>
For
a
few
moments
Gwendolen
did
not
answer
,
but
her
thoughts
were
active
.
<EOS>
At
last
she
raised
herself
with
a
determination
to
do
as
she
would
do
if
she
had
started
on
horseback
,
and
go
on
with
spirit
,
whatever
ideas
might
be
running
in
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
the
lover
always
put
on
the
betrothal
ring
himself
,
"
she
said
laughingly
,
slipping
the
ring
on
her
finger
,
and
looking
at
it
with
a
charming
movement
of
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
why
he
has
sent
it
,
"
she
added
,
nodding
at
her
mamma
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
would
rather
make
me
put
it
on
than
ask
me
to
let
him
do
it
.
<EOS>
Aha
!
<EOS>
he
is
very
proud
.
<EOS>
But
so
am
I.
<EOS>
We
shall
match
each
other
.
<EOS>
I
should
hate
a
man
who
went
down
on
his
knees
,
and
came
fawning
on
me
.
<EOS>
He
really
is
not
disgusting
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
very
moderate
praise
,
Gwen
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
it
is
not
,
for
a
man
,
"
said
Gwendolen
gaily
.
<EOS>
"
But
now
I
must
get
up
and
dress
.
<EOS>
Will
you
come
and
do
my
hair
,
mamma
,
dear
,
"
she
went
on
,
drawing
down
her
mamma
's
face
to
caress
it
with
her
own
cheeks
,
"
and
not
be
so
naughty
any
more
as
to
talk
of
living
in
poverty
?
<EOS>
You
must
bear
to
be
made
comfortable
,
even
if
you
do
n't
like
it
.
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Grandcourt
behaves
perfectly
,
now
,
does
he
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
he
does
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
encouraged
,
and
persuaded
that
after
all
Gwendolen
was
fond
of
her
betrothed
.
<EOS>
She
herself
thought
him
a
man
whose
attentions
were
likely
to
tell
on
a
girl
's
feeling
.
<EOS>
Suitors
must
often
be
judged
as
words
are
,
by
the
standing
and
the
figure
they
make
in
polite
society
:
it
is
difficult
to
know
much
else
of
them
.
<EOS>
And
all
the
mother
's
anxiety
turned
not
on
Grandcourt
's
character
,
but
on
Gwendolen
's
mood
in
accepting
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
mood
was
necessarily
passing
through
a
new
phase
this
morning
.
<EOS>
Even
in
the
hour
of
making
her
toilet
,
she
had
drawn
on
all
the
knowledge
she
had
for
grounds
to
justify
her
marriage
.
<EOS>
And
what
she
most
dwelt
on
was
the
determination
,
that
when
she
was
Grandcourt
's
wife
,
she
would
urge
him
to
the
most
liberal
conduct
toward
Mrs.
Glasher
's
children
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
what
use
would
it
be
to
her
that
I
should
not
marry
him
?
<EOS>
He
could
have
married
her
if
he
liked
;
but
he
did
_
<EOS>
not
_
like
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
she
is
to
blame
for
that
.
<EOS>
There
must
be
a
great
deal
about
her
that
I
know
nothing
of
.
<EOS>
And
he
must
have
been
good
to
her
in
many
ways
,
else
she
would
not
have
wanted
to
marry
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
that
last
argument
at
once
began
to
appear
doubtful
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Glasher
naturally
wished
to
exclude
other
children
who
would
stand
between
Grandcourt
and
her
own
:
and
Gwendolen
's
comprehension
of
this
feeling
prompted
another
way
of
reconciling
claims
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
we
shall
have
no
children
.
<EOS>
I
hope
we
shall
not
.
<EOS>
And
he
might
leave
the
estate
to
the
pretty
little
boy
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
said
that
Mr.
Grandcourt
could
do
as
he
liked
with
the
estates
.
<EOS>
Only
when
Sir
Hugo
Mallinger
dies
there
will
be
enough
for
two
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
made
Mrs.
Glasher
appear
quite
unreasonable
in
demanding
that
her
boy
should
be
sole
heir
;
and
the
double
property
was
a
security
that
Grandcourt
's
marriage
would
do
her
no
wrong
,
when
the
wife
was
Gwendolen
Harleth
with
all
her
proud
resolution
not
to
be
fairly
accused
.
<EOS>
This
maiden
had
been
accustomed
to
think
herself
blameless
;
other
persons
only
were
faulty
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
striking
,
that
in
the
hold
which
this
argument
of
her
doing
no
wrong
to
Mrs.
Glasher
had
taken
on
her
mind
,
her
repugnance
to
the
idea
of
Grandcourt
's
past
had
sunk
into
a
subordinate
feeling
.
<EOS>
The
terror
she
had
felt
in
the
night
-
watches
at
overstepping
the
border
of
wickedness
by
doing
what
she
had
at
first
felt
to
be
wrong
,
had
dulled
any
emotions
about
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
She
was
thinking
of
him
,
whatever
he
might
be
,
as
a
man
over
whom
she
was
going
to
have
indefinite
power
;
and
her
loving
him
having
never
been
a
question
with
her
,
any
agreeableness
he
had
was
so
much
gain
.
<EOS>
Poor
Gwendolen
had
no
awe
of
unmanageable
forces
in
the
state
of
matrimony
,
but
regarded
it
as
altogether
a
matter
of
management
,
in
which
she
would
know
how
to
act
.
<EOS>
In
relation
to
Grandcourt
's
past
she
encouraged
new
doubts
whether
he
were
likely
to
have
differed
much
from
other
men
;
and
she
devised
little
schemes
for
learning
what
was
expected
of
men
in
general
.
  
<EOS>
But
whatever
else
might
be
true
in
the
world
,
her
hair
was
dressed
suitably
for
riding
,
and
she
went
down
in
her
riding
-
habit
,
to
avoid
delay
before
getting
on
horseback
.
<EOS>
She
wanted
to
have
her
blood
stirred
once
more
with
the
intoxication
of
youth
,
and
to
recover
the
daring
with
which
she
had
been
used
to
think
of
her
course
in
life
.
<EOS>
Already
a
load
was
lifted
off
her
;
for
in
daylight
and
activity
it
was
less
oppressive
to
have
doubts
about
her
choice
,
than
to
feel
that
she
had
no
choice
but
to
endure
insignificance
and
servitude
.
  
<EOS>
"
Go
back
and
make
yourself
look
like
a
duchess
,
mamma
,
"
she
said
,
turning
suddenly
as
she
was
going
down
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Put
your
point
-
lace
over
your
head
.
<EOS>
I
must
have
you
look
like
a
duchess
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
take
things
humbly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
Grandcourt
raised
her
left
hand
gently
and
looked
at
the
ring
,
she
said
gravely
,
"
It
was
very
good
of
you
to
think
of
everything
and
send
me
that
packet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
tell
me
if
there
is
anything
I
forget
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
keeping
the
hand
softly
within
his
own
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
anything
you
wish
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
very
unreasonable
in
my
wishes
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
smiling
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
expect
that
.
<EOS>
Women
always
are
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
will
not
be
unreasonable
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
taking
away
her
hand
and
tossing
her
head
saucily
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
be
told
that
I
am
what
women
always
are
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
say
that
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
looking
at
her
with
his
usual
gravity
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
what
no
other
woman
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
is
that
,
pray
?
"
said
Gwendolen
,
moving
to
a
distance
with
a
little
air
of
menace
.
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
made
his
pause
before
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
the
woman
I
love
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
what
nice
speeches
!
"
said
Gwendolen
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
The
sense
of
that
love
which
he
must
once
have
given
to
another
woman
under
strange
circumstances
was
getting
familiar
.
  
<EOS>
"
Give
me
a
nice
speech
in
return
.
<EOS>
Say
when
we
are
to
be
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
yet
.
<EOS>
Not
till
we
have
had
a
gallop
over
the
downs
.
<EOS>
I
am
so
thirsty
for
that
,
I
can
think
of
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
I
wish
the
hunting
had
begun
.
<EOS>
Sunday
the
twentieth
,
twenty
-
seventh
,
Monday
,
Tuesday
.
<EOS>
"
Gwendolen
was
counting
on
her
fingers
with
the
prettiest
nod
while
she
looked
at
Grandcourt
,
and
at
last
swept
one
palm
over
the
other
while
she
said
triumphantly
,
"
It
will
begin
in
ten
days
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
be
married
in
ten
days
,
then
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
"
and
we
shall
not
be
bored
about
the
stables
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
women
always
say
in
answer
to
that
?
"
said
Gwendolen
,
mischievously
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
agree
to
it
,
"
said
the
lover
,
rather
off
his
guard
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
will
not
!
"
<EOS>
said
Gwendolen
,
taking
up
her
gauntlets
and
putting
them
on
,
while
she
kept
her
eyes
on
him
with
gathering
fun
in
them
.
  
<EOS>
The
scene
was
pleasant
on
both
sides
.
<EOS>
A
cruder
lover
would
have
lost
the
view
of
her
pretty
ways
and
attitudes
,
and
spoiled
all
by
stupid
attempts
at
caresses
,
utterly
destructive
of
drama
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
preferred
the
drama
;
and
Gwendolen
,
left
at
ease
,
found
her
spirits
rising
continually
as
she
played
at
reigning
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
if
Klesmer
had
seen
more
of
her
in
this
unconscious
kind
of
acting
,
instead
of
when
she
was
trying
to
be
theatrical
,
he
might
have
rated
her
chance
higher
.
  
<EOS>
When
they
had
had
a
glorious
gallop
,
however
,
she
was
in
a
state
of
exhilaration
that
disposed
her
to
think
well
of
hastening
the
marriage
which
would
make
her
life
all
of
apiece
with
this
splendid
kind
of
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
debate
any
more
about
an
act
to
which
she
had
committed
herself
;
and
she
consented
to
fix
the
wedding
on
that
day
three
weeks
,
notwithstanding
the
difficulty
of
fulfilling
the
customary
laws
of
the
_
trousseau
_
.
  
<EOS>
Lush
,
of
course
,
was
made
aware
of
the
engagement
by
abundant
signs
,
without
being
formally
told
.
<EOS>
But
he
expected
some
communication
as
a
consequence
of
it
,
and
after
a
few
days
he
became
rather
impatient
under
Grandcourt
's
silence
,
feeling
sure
that
the
change
would
affect
his
personal
prospects
,
and
wishing
to
know
exactly
how
.
<EOS>
His
tactics
no
longer
included
any
opposition
 
which
he
did
not
love
for
its
own
sake
.
<EOS>
He
might
easily
cause
Grandcourt
a
great
deal
of
annoyance
,
but
it
would
be
to
his
own
injury
,
and
to
create
annoyance
was
not
a
motive
with
him
.
<EOS>
Miss
Gwendolen
he
would
certainly
not
have
been
sorry
to
frustrate
a
little
,
but
 
after
all
there
was
no
knowing
what
would
come
.
<EOS>
It
was
nothing
new
that
Grandcourt
should
show
a
perverse
wilfulness
;
yet
in
his
freak
about
this
girl
he
struck
Lush
rather
newly
as
something
like
a
man
who
was
<EOS>
_
fey
<EOS>
_
 
led
on
by
an
ominous
fatality
;
and
that
one
born
to
his
fortune
should
make
a
worse
business
of
his
life
than
was
necessary
,
seemed
really
pitiable
.
<EOS>
Having
protested
against
the
marriage
,
Lush
had
a
second
-
sight
for
its
evil
consequences
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
had
been
taking
the
pains
to
write
letters
and
give
orders
himself
instead
of
employing
Lush
,
and
appeared
to
be
ignoring
his
usefulness
,
even
choosing
,
against
the
habit
of
years
,
to
breakfast
alone
in
his
dressing
-
room
.
<EOS>
But
a
_
tete
-
à
-
tete
_
was
not
to
be
avoided
in
a
house
empty
of
guests
;
and
Lush
hastened
to
use
an
opportunity
of
saying
 
it
was
one
day
after
dinner
,
for
there
were
difficulties
in
Grandcourt
's
dining
at
Offendene
    
"
<EOS>
And
when
is
the
marriage
to
take
place
?
"
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
,
who
drank
little
wine
,
had
left
the
table
and
was
lounging
,
while
he
smoked
,
in
an
easy
chair
near
the
hearth
,
where
a
fire
of
oak
boughs
was
gaping
to
its
glowing
depths
,
and
edging
them
with
a
delicate
tint
of
ashes
delightful
to
behold
.
<EOS>
The
chair
of
red
-
brown
velvet
brocade
was
a
becoming
back
-
ground
for
his
pale
-
tinted
,
well
-
cut
features
and
exquisite
long
hands
.
<EOS>
Omitting
the
cigar
,
you
might
have
imagined
him
a
portrait
by
Moroni
,
who
would
have
rendered
wonderfully
the
impenetrable
gaze
and
air
of
distinction
;
and
<EOS>
a
portrait
by
that
great
master
would
have
been
quite
as
lively
a
companion
as
Grandcourt
was
disposed
to
be
.
<EOS>
But
he
answered
without
unusual
delay
.
  
<EOS>
"
On
the
tenth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
intend
to
remain
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
go
to
Ryelands
for
a
little
while
;
but
we
shall
return
here
for
the
sake
of
the
hunting
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
After
this
word
there
was
the
languid
inarticulate
sound
frequent
with
Grandcourt
when
he
meant
to
continue
speaking
,
and
Lush
waited
for
something
more
.
<EOS>
Nothing
came
,
and
he
was
going
to
put
another
question
,
when
the
inarticulate
sound
began
again
and
introduced
the
mildly
uttered
suggestion
    
"
You
had
better
make
some
new
arrangement
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
I
am
to
cut
and
run
?
"
said
Lush
,
prepared
to
be
good
-
tempered
on
the
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Something
of
that
kind
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
bride
objects
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
hope
she
will
make
up
to
you
for
the
want
of
my
services
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
help
your
being
so
damnably
disagreeable
to
women
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
in
soothing
apology
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
one
woman
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
makes
no
difference
since
she
is
the
one
in
question
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
am
not
to
be
turned
adrift
after
fifteen
years
without
some
provision
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
saved
something
out
of
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Deuced
little
.
<EOS>
I
have
often
saved
something
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
have
three
hundred
a
year
.
<EOS>
But
you
must
live
in
town
and
be
ready
to
look
after
things
when
I
want
you
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
rather
hard
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
not
going
to
be
at
Ryelands
this
winter
,
I
might
run
down
there
and
let
you
know
how
Swinton
goes
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
you
like
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
care
a
toss
where
you
are
,
so
that
you
keep
out
of
sight
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Much
obliged
,
"
said
Lush
,
able
to
take
the
affair
more
easily
than
he
had
expected
.
<EOS>
He
was
supported
by
the
secret
belief
that
he
should
by
-
and
-
by
be
wanted
as
much
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
will
not
object
to
packing
up
as
soon
as
possible
,
"
said
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Torringtons
are
coming
,
and
Miss
Harleth
will
be
riding
over
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
With
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
Ca
n't
I
be
of
use
in
going
to
Gadsmere
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
I
am
going
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
About
your
being
rather
hard
up
.
<EOS>
Have
you
thought
of
that
plan
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Just
leave
me
alone
,
will
you
?
"
said
Grandcourt
,
in
his
lowest
audible
tone
,
tossing
his
cigar
into
the
fire
,
and
rising
to
walk
away
.
  
<EOS>
He
spent
the
evening
in
the
solitude
of
the
smaller
drawing
-
room
,
where
,
with
various
new
publications
on
the
table
of
the
kind
a
gentleman
may
like
to
have
on
hand
without
touching
,
he
employed
himself
(
as
a
philosopher
might
have
done
)
in
sitting
meditatively
on
the
sofa
and
abstaining
from
literature
 
political
,
comic
,
cynical
,
or
romantic
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
hours
may
pass
surprisingly
soon
,
without
the
arduous
invisible
chase
of
philosophy
;
not
from
love
of
thought
,
but
from
hatred
of
effort
 
from
a
state
of
the
inward
world
,
something
like
premature
age
,
where
the
need
for
action
lapses
into
a
mere
image
of
what
has
been
,
is
,
and
may
or
might
be
;
where
impulse
is
born
and
dies
in
a
phantasmal
world
,
pausing
in
rejection
of
even
a
shadowy
fulfillment
.
<EOS>
That
is
a
condition
which
often
comes
with
whitening
hair
;
and
sometimes
,
too
,
an
intense
obstinacy
and
tenacity
of
rule
,
like
the
main
trunk
of
an
exorbitant
egoism
,
conspicuous
in
proportion
as
the
varied
susceptibilities
of
younger
years
are
stripped
away
.
  
<EOS>
But
Grandcourt
's
hair
,
though
he
had
not
much
of
it
,
was
of
a
fine
,
sunny
blonde
,
and
his
moods
were
not
entirely
to
be
explained
as
ebbing
energy
.
<EOS>
We
mortals
have
a
strange
spiritual
chemistry
going
on
within
us
,
so
that
a
lazy
stagnation
or
even
a
cottony
milkiness
may
be
preparing
one
<EOS>
knows
not
what
biting
or
explosive
material
.
<EOS>
The
navvy
waking
from
sleep
and
without
malice
heaving
a
stone
to
crush
the
life
out
of
his
still
sleeping
comrade
,
is
understood
to
lack
the
trained
motive
which
makes
a
character
fairly
calculable
in
its
actions
;
but
by
a
roundabout
course
even
a
gentleman
may
make
of
himself
a
chancy
personage
,
raising
an
uncertainty
as
to
what
he
may
do
next
,
that
sadly
spoils
companionship
.
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
's
thoughts
this
evening
were
like
the
circlets
one
sees
in
a
dark
pool
,
continually
dying
out
and
continually
started
again
by
some
impulse
from
below
the
surface
.
<EOS>
The
deeper
central
impulse
came
from
the
image
of
Gwendolen
;
but
the
thoughts
it
stirred
would
be
imperfectly
illustrated
by
a
reference
to
the
amatory
poets
of
all
ages
.
<EOS>
It
was
characteristic
that
he
got
none
of
his
satisfaction
from
the
belief
that
Gwendolen
was
in
love
with
him
;
and
that
love
had
overcome
the
jealous
resentment
which
had
made
her
run
away
from
him
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
he
believed
that
this
girl
was
rather
exceptional
in
the
fact
that
,
in
spite
of
his
assiduous
attention
to
her
,
she
was
not
in
love
with
him
;
and
it
seemed
to
him
very
likely
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
sudden
poverty
which
had
come
over
her
family
,
she
would
not
have
accepted
him
.
<EOS>
From
the
very
first
there
had
been
an
exasperating
fascination
in
the
tricksiness
with
which
she
had
 
not
met
his
advances
,
but
 
wheeled
away
from
them
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
brought
to
accept
him
in
spite
of
everything
 
brought
to
kneel
down
like
a
horse
under
training
for
the
arena
,
though
she
might
have
an
objection
to
it
all
the
while
.
<EOS>
On
the
whole
,
Grandcourt
got
more
pleasure
out
of
this
notion
than
he
could
have
done
out
of
winning
a
girl
of
whom
he
was
sure
that
she
had
a
strong
inclination
for
him
personally
.
<EOS>
And
yet
this
pleasure
in
mastering
reluctance
flourished
along
with
the
habitual
persuasion
that
no
woman
whom
he
favored
could
be
quite
indifferent
to
his
personal
influence
;
and
it
seemed
to
him
not
unlikely
that
by
-
and
-
by
Gwendolen
might
be
more
enamored
of
him
than
he
of
her
.
<EOS>
In
any
case
,
she
would
have
to
submit
;
and
he
enjoyed
thinking
of
her
as
his
future
wife
,
whose
pride
and
spirit
were
suited
to
command
every
one
but
himself
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
taste
for
a
woman
who
was
all
tenderness
to
him
,
full
of
petitioning
solicitude
and
willing
obedience
.
<EOS>
He
meant
to
be
master
of
a
woman
who
would
have
liked
to
master
him
,
and
who
perhaps
would
have
been
capable
of
mastering
another
man
.
  
<EOS>
Lush
,
having
failed
in
his
attempted
reminder
to
Grandcourt
,
thought
it
well
to
communicate
with
Sir
Hugo
,
in
whom
,
as
a
man
having
perhaps
interest
enough
to
command
the
bestowal
of
some
place
where
the
work
was
light
,
gentlemanly
,
and
not
ill
-
paid
,
he
was
anxious
to
cultivate
a
sense
of
friendly
obligation
,
not
feeling
at
all
secure
against
the
future
need
of
such
a
place
.
<EOS>
He
wrote
the
following
letter
,
and
addressed
it
to
Park
Lane
,
whither
he
knew
the
family
had
returned
from
Leubronn
:
        
MY
DEAR
SIR
HUGO
 
<EOS>
Since
we
came
home
the
marriage
has
been
absolutely
    
decided
on
,
and
is
to
take
place
in
less
than
three
weeks
.
<EOS>
It
is
so
    
far
the
worse
for
him
that
her
mother
has
lately
lost
all
her
fortune
,
    
and
he
will
have
to
find
supplies
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
,
I
know
,
is
feeling
the
    
want
of
cash
;
and
unless
some
other
plan
is
resorted
to
,
he
will
be
    
raising
money
in
a
foolish
way
.
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
leave
Diplow
    
immediately
,
and
I
shall
not
be
able
to
start
the
topic
.
<EOS>
What
I
should
    
<EOS>
advise
is
,
that
Mr.
Deronda
,
who
I
know
has
your
confidence
,
should
    
propose
to
come
and
pay
a
short
visit
here
,
according
to
invitation
    
(
there
are
going
to
be
other
people
in
the
house
)
,
and
that
you
should
    
put
him
fully
in
possession
of
your
wishes
and
the
possible
extent
of
    
your
offer
.
<EOS>
Then
,
that
he
should
introduce
the
subject
to
Grandcourt
    
<EOS>
so
as
not
to
imply
that
you
suspect
any
particular
want
of
money
on
    
his
part
,
but
only
that
there
is
a
strong
wish
on
yours
<EOS>
,
What
I
have
    
formerly
said
to
him
has
been
in
the
way
of
a
conjecture
that
you
    
might
be
willing
to
give
a
good
sum
for
his
chance
of
Diplow
;
but
if
    
Mr.
Deronda
came
armed
with
a
definite
offer
,
that
would
take
another
    
sort
of
hold
.
<EOS>
Ten
to
one
he
will
not
close
for
some
time
to
come
;
but
    
the
proposal
will
have
got
a
stronger
lodgment
in
his
mind
;
and
though
    
at
present
he
has
a
great
notion
of
the
hunting
here
,
I
see
a
    
likelihood
,
under
the
circumstances
,
that
he
will
get
a
distaste
for
    
the
neighborhood
,
and
there
will
be
the
notion
of
the
money
sticking
    
by
him
without
being
urged
.
<EOS>
I
would
bet
on
your
ultimate
success
.
<EOS>
As
I
    
am
not
to
be
exiled
to
Siberia
,
but
am
to
be
within
call
,
it
is
    
possible
that
,
by
and
by
,
I
may
be
of
more
service
to
you
.
<EOS>
But
at
    
present
I
can
think
of
no
medium
so
good
as
Mr.
Deronda
.
<EOS>
Nothing
puts
    
Grandcourt
in
worse
humor
than
having
the
lawyers
thrust
their
paper
    
under
his
nose
uninvited
.
      
<EOS>
Trusting
that
your
visit
to
Leubronn
has
put
you
in
excellent
    
condition
 
for
the
winter
,
I
remain
,
my
dear
Sir
Hugo
,
      
Yours
very
faithfully
,
      
THOMAS
CRANMER
LUSH
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
,
having
received
this
letter
at
breakfast
,
handed
it
to
Deronda
,
who
,
though
he
had
chambers
in
town
,
was
somehow
hardly
ever
in
them
,
Sir
Hugo
not
being
contented
without
him
.
<EOS>
The
chatty
baronet
would
have
liked
a
young
companion
even
if
there
had
been
no
peculiar
reasons
for
attachment
between
them
:
one
with
a
fine
harmonious
unspoiled
face
fitted
to
keep
up
a
cheerful
view
of
posterity
and
inheritance
generally
,
notwithstanding
particular
disappointments
;
and
his
affection
for
Deronda
was
not
diminished
by
the
deep
-
lying
though
not
obtrusive
difference
in
their
notions
and
tastes
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
was
all
the
stronger
;
acting
as
the
same
sort
of
difference
does
between
a
man
and
a
woman
in
giving
a
piquancy
to
the
attachment
which
subsists
in
spite
of
it
.
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
did
not
think
unapprovingly
of
himself
;
but
he
looked
at
men
and
society
from
a
liberal
-
menagerie
point
of
view
,
and
he
had
a
certain
pride
in
Deronda
's
differing
from
him
,
which
,
if
it
had
found
voice
,
might
have
said
 
"
You
see
this
fine
young
fellow
 
not
such
as
you
see
every
day
,
is
he
?
 
<EOS>
he
belongs
to
me
in
a
sort
of
way
.
<EOS>
I
brought
him
up
from
a
child
;
but
you
would
not
ticket
him
off
easily
,
he
has
notions
of
his
own
,
and
he
's
as
far
as
the
poles
asunder
from
what
I
was
at
his
age
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
state
of
feeling
was
kept
up
by
the
mental
balance
in
Deronda
,
who
was
moved
by
an
affectionateness
such
as
we
are
apt
to
call
feminine
,
disposing
him
to
yield
in
ordinary
details
,
while
he
had
a
certain
inflexibility
of
judgment
,
and
independence
of
opinion
,
held
to
be
rightfully
masculine
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
had
read
the
letter
,
he
returned
it
without
speaking
,
inwardly
wincing
under
Lush
's
mode
of
attributing
a
neutral
usefulness
to
him
in
the
family
affairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
say
,
Dan
?
<EOS>
It
would
be
pleasant
enough
for
you
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
seen
the
place
for
a
good
many
years
now
,
and
you
might
have
a
famous
run
with
the
harriers
if
you
went
down
next
week
,
"
said
Sir
Hugo
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
go
on
that
account
,
"
said
Deronda
,
buttering
his
bread
attentively
.
<EOS>
He
had
an
objection
to
this
transparent
kind
of
persuasiveness
,
which
all
intelligent
animals
are
seen
to
treat
with
indifference
.
<EOS>
If
he
went
to
Diplow
he
should
be
doing
something
disagreeable
to
oblige
Sir
Hugo
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
Lush
's
notion
is
a
good
one
.
<EOS>
And
it
would
be
a
pity
to
lose
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
a
different
matter
 
if
you
think
my
going
of
importance
to
your
object
,
"
said
Deronda
,
still
with
that
aloofness
of
manner
which
implied
some
suppression
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
the
baronet
had
set
his
heart
on
the
affair
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
will
see
the
fair
gambler
,
the
Leubronn
Diana
,
I
should
n't
wonder
,
"
said
Sir
Hugo
,
gaily
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
have
to
invite
her
to
the
Abbey
,
when
they
are
married
,
"
he
added
,
turning
to
Lady
Mallinger
,
as
if
she
too
had
read
the
letter
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
conceive
whom
you
mean
,
"
said
Lady
Mallinger
,
who
in
fact
had
not
been
listening
,
her
mind
having
been
taken
up
with
her
first
sips
of
coffee
,
the
objectionable
cuff
of
her
sleeve
,
and
the
necessity
of
carrying
Theresa
to
the
dentist
 
innocent
and
partly
laudable
preoccupations
,
as
the
gentle
lady
's
usually
were
.
<EOS>
Should
her
appearance
be
inquired
after
,
let
it
be
said
that
she
had
reddish
blonde
hair
(
the
hair
of
the
period
)
,
a
small
Roman
nose
,
rather
prominent
blue
eyes
and
delicate
eyelids
,
with
a
figure
which
her
thinner
friends
called
fat
,
her
hands
showing
curves
and
dimples
like
a
magnified
baby
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
that
Grandcourt
is
going
to
marry
the
girl
you
saw
at
Leubronn
 
<EOS>
do
n't
you
remember
her
 
the
Miss
Harleth
who
used
to
play
at
roulette
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
<EOS>
Is
that
a
good
match
for
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
depends
on
the
sort
of
goodness
he
wants
,
"
said
Sir
Hugo
,
smiling
.
"
<EOS>
However
,
she
and
her
friends
have
nothing
,
and
she
will
bring
him
expenses
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
good
match
for
my
purposes
,
because
if
I
am
willing
to
fork
out
a
sum
of
money
,
he
may
be
willing
to
give
up
his
chance
of
Diplow
,
so
that
we
shall
have
it
out
and
out
,
and
when
I
die
you
will
have
the
consolation
of
going
to
the
place
you
would
like
to
go
to
 
wherever
I
may
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
would
not
talk
of
dying
in
that
light
way
,
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
rather
a
heavy
way
,
Lou
,
for
I
shall
have
to
pay
a
heavy
sum
 
<EOS>
forty
thousand
,
at
least
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
why
are
we
to
invite
them
to
the
Abbey
?
"
said
Lady
Mallinger
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
_
not
_
like
women
who
gamble
,
like
Lady
Cragstone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
will
not
mind
her
for
a
week
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
she
is
not
like
Lady
Cragstone
because
she
gambled
a
little
,
any
more
than
I
am
like
a
broker
because
I
'm
a
Whig
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
keep
Grandcourt
in
good
humor
,
and
to
let
him
see
plenty
of
this
place
,
that
he
may
think
the
less
of
Diplow
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
yet
whether
I
shall
get
him
to
meet
me
in
this
matter
.
<EOS>
And
if
Dan
were
to
go
over
on
a
visit
there
,
he
might
hold
out
the
bait
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
doing
me
a
great
service
.
<EOS>
"
This
was
meant
for
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
Daniel
is
not
fond
of
Mr.
Grandcourt
,
I
think
,
is
he
?
"
said
Lady
Mallinger
,
looking
at
Deronda
inquiringly
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
avoiding
everybody
one
does
n't
happen
to
be
fond
of
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
to
Diplow
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
that
I
have
anything
better
to
do
 
since
Sir
Hugo
wishes
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
trump
!
"
said
Sir
Hugo
,
well
pleased
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
if
you
do
n't
find
it
very
pleasant
,
it
's
so
much
experience
.
<EOS>
Nothing
used
to
come
amiss
to
me
when
I
was
young
.
<EOS>
You
must
see
men
and
manners
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
but
I
have
seen
that
man
,
and
something
of
his
manners
too
,
"
said
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
nice
manners
,
I
think
,
"
said
Lady
Mallinger
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
you
see
they
succeed
with
your
sex
,
"
said
Sir
Hugo
,
provokingly
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
was
an
uncommonly
good
-
looking
fellow
when
he
was
two
or
three
and
twenty
 
like
his
father
.
<EOS>
He
does
n't
take
after
his
father
in
marrying
the
heiress
,
though
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
got
Miss
Arrowpoint
and
my
land
too
,
confound
him
,
he
would
have
had
a
fine
principality
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
,
in
anticipating
the
projected
visit
,
felt
less
disinclination
than
when
consenting
to
it
.
<EOS>
The
story
of
that
girl
's
marriage
did
interest
him
:
what
he
had
heard
through
Lush
of
her
having
run
away
from
the
suit
of
the
man
she
was
now
going
to
take
as
a
husband
,
had
thrown
a
new
sort
of
light
on
her
gambling
;
and
it
was
probably
the
transition
from
that
fevered
worldliness
into
poverty
which
had
urged
her
acceptance
where
she
must
in
some
way
have
felt
repulsion
.
<EOS>
All
this
implied
a
nature
liable
to
difficulty
and
struggle
 
elements
of
life
which
had
a
predominant
attraction
for
his
sympathy
,
due
perhaps
to
his
early
pain
in
dwelling
on
the
conjectured
story
of
his
own
existence
.
<EOS>
Persons
attracted
him
,
as
Hans
Meyrick
had
done
,
in
proportion
to
the
possibility
of
his
defending
them
,
rescuing
them
,
telling
upon
their
lives
with
some
sort
of
redeeming
influence
;
and
he
had
to
resist
an
inclination
,
easily
accounted
for
,
to
withdraw
coldly
from
the
fortunate
.
<EOS>
But
in
the
movement
which
had
led
him
to
repurchase
Gwendolen
's
necklace
for
her
,
and
which
was
at
work
in
him
still
,
there
was
something
beyond
his
habitual
compassionate
fervor
 
something
due
to
the
fascination
of
her
womanhood
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
open
to
that
sort
of
charm
,
and
mingled
it
with
the
consciously
Utopian
pictures
of
his
own
future
;
yet
any
one
able
to
trace
the
folds
of
his
character
might
have
conceived
that
he
would
be
more
likely
than
many
less
passionate
men
to
love
a
woman
without
telling
her
of
it
.
<EOS>
Sprinkle
food
before
a
delicate
-
eared
bird
:
there
is
nothing
he
would
more
willingly
take
,
yet
he
keeps
aloof
,
because
of
his
sensibility
to
checks
which
to
you
are
imperceptible
.
<EOS>
And
one
man
differs
from
another
,
as
we
all
differ
from
the
Bosjesman
,
in
a
sensibility
to
checks
,
that
come
from
variety
of
needs
,
spiritual
or
other
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
foreshadow
that
capability
of
reticence
in
Deronda
that
his
imagination
was
much
occupied
with
two
women
,
to
neither
of
whom
would
he
have
held
it
possible
that
he
should
ever
make
love
.
<EOS>
Hans
Meyrick
had
laughed
at
him
for
having
something
of
the
knight
-
errant
in
his
disposition
;
and
he
would
have
found
his
proof
if
he
had
known
what
was
just
now
going
on
in
Deronda
's
mind
about
Mirah
and
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
wrote
without
delay
to
announce
his
visit
to
Diplow
,
and
received
in
reply
a
polite
assurance
that
his
coming
would
give
great
pleasure
.
<EOS>
That
was
not
altogether
untrue
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
thought
it
probable
that
the
visit
was
prompted
by
Sir
Hugo
's
desire
to
court
him
for
a
purpose
which
he
did
not
make
up
his
mind
to
resist
;
and
it
was
not
a
disagreeable
idea
to
him
that
this
fine
fellow
,
whom
he
believed
to
be
his
cousin
under
the
rose
,
would
witness
,
perhaps
with
some
jealousy
,
Henleigh
Mallinger
Grandcourt
play
the
commanding
part
of
betrothed
lover
to
a
splendid
girl
whom
the
cousin
had
already
looked
at
with
admiration
.
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
himself
was
not
jealous
of
anything
unless
it
threatened
his
mastery
 
which
he
did
not
think
himself
likely
to
lose
.
      
<EOS>
"
Surely
whoever
speaks
to
me
in
the
right
voice
,
     
him
or
her
I
shall
follow
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
water
follows
the
moon
,
silently
,
     
with
fluid
steps
anywhere
around
the
globe
.
<EOS>
"
                                      
<EOS>
WALT
WHITMAN
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
my
cousins
are
at
Diplow
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
"
will
you
go
there
?
 
<EOS>
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
The
carriage
shall
come
for
Mrs.
Davilow
.
<EOS>
You
can
tell
me
what
you
would
like
done
in
the
rooms
.
<EOS>
Things
must
be
put
in
decent
order
while
we
are
away
at
Ryelands
.
<EOS>
And
to
-
morrow
is
the
only
day
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
sitting
sideways
on
a
sofa
in
the
drawing
-
room
at
Offendene
,
one
hand
and
elbow
resting
on
the
back
,
and
the
other
hand
thrust
between
his
crossed
knees
 
in
the
attitude
of
a
man
who
is
much
interested
in
watching
the
person
next
to
him
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
who
had
always
disliked
needlework
,
had
taken
to
it
with
apparent
zeal
since
her
engagement
,
and
now
held
a
piece
of
white
embroidery
which
,
on
examination
,
would
have
shown
many
false
stitches
.
<EOS>
During
the
last
eight
or
nine
days
their
hours
had
been
chiefly
spent
on
horseback
,
but
some
margin
had
always
been
left
for
this
more
difficult
sort
of
companionship
,
which
,
however
,
Gwendolen
had
not
found
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
She
was
very
well
satisfied
with
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
His
answers
to
her
lively
questions
about
what
he
had
seen
and
done
in
his
life
,
bore
drawling
very
well
.
<EOS>
From
the
first
she
had
noticed
that
he
knew
what
to
say
;
and
she
was
constantly
feeling
not
only
that
he
had
nothing
of
the
fool
in
his
composition
,
but
that
by
some
subtle
means
he
communicated
to
her
the
impression
that
all
the
folly
lay
with
other
people
,
who
did
what
he
did
not
care
to
do
.
<EOS>
A
man
who
seems
to
have
been
able
to
command
the
best
,
has
a
sovereign
power
of
depreciation
.
<EOS>
Then
Grandcourt
's
behavior
as
a
lover
had
hardly
at
all
passed
the
limit
of
an
amorous
homage
which
was
inobtrusive
as
a
wafted
odor
of
roses
,
and
spent
all
its
effects
in
a
gratified
vanity
.
<EOS>
One
day
,
indeed
,
he
had
kissed
not
her
cheek
but
her
neck
a
little
below
her
ear
;
and
Gwendolen
,
taken
by
surprise
,
had
started
up
with
a
marked
agitation
which
made
him
rise
too
and
say
,
"
I
beg
your
pardon
 
<EOS>
did
I
annoy
you
?
"
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
was
nothing
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
rather
afraid
of
herself
,
"
only
I
can
not
bear
 
to
be
kissed
under
my
ear
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
sat
down
again
with
a
little
playful
laugh
,
but
<EOS>
all
the
while
she
felt
her
heart
beating
with
a
vague
fear
:
she
was
no
longer
at
liberty
to
flout
him
as
she
had
flouted
poor
Rex
.
<EOS>
Her
agitation
seemed
not
uncomplimentary
,
and
he
had
been
contented
not
to
transgress
again
.
  
<EOS>
To
-
day
a
slight
rain
hindered
riding
;
but
to
compensate
,
a
package
had
come
from
London
,
and
Mrs.
Davilow
had
just
left
the
room
after
bringing
in
for
admiration
the
beautiful
things
(
of
Grandcourt
's
ordering
)
which
lay
scattered
about
on
the
tables
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
was
just
then
enjoying
the
scenery
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
She
let
her
hands
fall
on
her
lap
,
and
said
with
a
pretty
air
of
perversity
    
"
Why
is
to
-
morrow
the
only
day
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
the
next
day
is
the
first
with
the
hounds
,
"
said
Grandcourt
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
after
that
?
"
  
"
After
that
I
must
go
away
for
a
couple
of
days
 
<EOS>
it
's
a
bore
 
<EOS>
but
I
shall
go
one
day
and
come
back
the
next
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Grandcourt
noticed
a
change
in
her
face
,
and
releasing
his
hand
from
under
his
knees
,
he
laid
it
on
hers
,
and
said
,
"
You
object
to
my
going
away
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
no
use
objecting
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
coldly
.
<EOS>
She
was
resisting
to
the
utmost
her
temptation
to
tell
him
that
she
suspected
to
whom
he
was
going
 
the
temptation
to
make
a
clean
breast
,
speaking
without
restraint
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
it
is
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
enfolding
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
put
off
going
.
<EOS>
And
I
will
travel
at
night
,
so
as
only
to
be
away
one
day
.
"
<EOS>
He
thought
that
he
knew
the
reason
of
what
he
inwardly
called
this
bit
of
temper
,
and
she
was
particularly
fascinating
to
him
at
this
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
do
n't
put
off
going
,
but
travel
at
night
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
feeling
that
she
could
command
him
,
and
finding
in
this
peremptoriness
a
small
outlet
for
her
irritation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
will
go
to
Diplow
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
if
you
wish
it
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
in
a
high
tone
of
careless
assent
.
<EOS>
Her
concentration
in
other
feelings
had
really
hindered
her
from
taking
notice
that
her
hand
was
being
held
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
you
treat
us
poor
devils
of
men
!
"
said
Grandcourt
,
lowering
his
tone
.
<EOS>
"
We
are
always
getting
the
worst
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
_
Are
_
you
?
"
<EOS>
said
Gwendolen
,
in
a
tone
of
inquiry
,
looking
at
him
more
naïvely
than
usual
.
<EOS>
She
longed
to
believe
this
commonplace
_
badinage
_
as
the
serious
truth
about
her
lover
:
in
that
case
,
she
too
was
justified
.
<EOS>
If
she
knew
everything
,
Mrs.
Glasher
would
appear
more
blamable
than
Grandcourt
.
"
<EOS>
_
Are
_
<EOS>
you
always
getting
the
worst
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
Are
you
as
kind
to
me
as
I
am
to
you
?
"
said
Grandcourt
,
looking
into
her
eyes
with
his
narrow
gaze
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
felt
herself
stricken
.
<EOS>
She
was
conscious
of
having
received
so
much
,
that
her
sense
of
command
was
checked
,
and
sank
away
in
the
perception
<EOS>
that
,
look
around
her
as
she
might
,
she
could
not
turn
back
:
it
was
as
if
she
had
consented
to
mount
a
chariot
where
another
held
the
reins
;
and
it
was
not
in
her
nature
to
leap
out
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
consented
in
ignorance
,
and
all
she
could
say
now
would
be
a
confession
that
she
had
not
been
ignorant
.
<EOS>
Her
right
to
explanation
was
gone
.
<EOS>
All
she
had
to
do
now
was
to
adjust
herself
,
so
that
the
spikes
of
that
unwilling
penance
which
conscience
imposed
should
not
gall
her
.
<EOS>
With
a
sort
of
mental
shiver
,
she
resolutely
changed
her
mental
attitude
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
a
little
pause
,
during
which
she
had
not
turned
away
her
eyes
;
and
with
a
sudden
break
into
a
smile
,
she
said
    
"
If
I
were
as
kind
to
you
as
you
are
to
me
,
that
would
spoil
your
generosity
:
it
would
no
longer
be
as
great
as
it
could
be
 
<EOS>
and
it
is
that
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
am
not
to
ask
for
one
kiss
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
contented
to
pay
a
large
price
for
this
new
kind
of
love
-
making
,
which
introduced
marriage
by
the
finest
contrast
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
one
?
<EOS>
"
said
Gwendolen
,
getting
saucy
,
and
nodding
at
him
defiantly
.
  
<EOS>
He
lifted
her
little
left
hand
to
his
lips
,
and
then
released
it
respectfully
.
<EOS>
Clearly
it
was
faint
praise
to
say
of
him
that
he
was
not
disgusting
:
he
was
almost
charming
;
and
she
felt
at
this
moment
that
it
was
not
likely
she
could
ever
have
loved
another
man
better
than
this
one
.
<EOS>
His
reticence
gave
her
some
inexplicable
,
delightful
consciousness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Apropos
<EOS>
,
"
she
said
,
taking
up
her
work
again
,
"
is
there
any
one
besides
Captain
and
Mrs.
Torrington
at
Diplow
?
 
<EOS>
or
do
you
leave
them
_
tete
-
à
-
tete
<EOS>
_
?
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
converses
in
cigars
,
and
she
answers
with
her
chignon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
a
sister
with
her
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
with
his
shadow
of
a
smile
,
"
and
there
are
two
men
besides
 
one
of
them
<EOS>
you
know
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
then
,
I
have
a
poor
opinion
of
him
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
shaking
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
saw
him
at
Leubronn
 
young
Deronda
 
a
young
fellow
with
the
Mallingers
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
felt
as
if
her
heart
were
making
a
sudden
gambol
,
and
her
fingers
,
which
tried
to
keep
a
firm
hold
on
her
work
,
got
cold
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
spoke
to
him
,
"
she
said
,
dreading
any
discernible
change
in
herself
.
<EOS>
"
Is
he
not
disagreeable
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
particularly
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
in
his
most
languid
way
.
"
<EOS>
He
thinks
a
little
too
much
of
himself
.
<EOS>
I
thought
he
had
been
introduced
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
Some
one
told
me
his
name
the
evening
before
I
came
away
.
<EOS>
That
was
all
.
<EOS>
What
is
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
sort
of
ward
of
Sir
Hugo
Mallinger
's
.
<EOS>
Nothing
of
any
consequence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
poor
creature
!
<EOS>
How
very
unpleasant
for
him
!
"
said
Gwendolen
,
speaking
from
the
lip
,
and
not
meaning
any
sarcasm
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
if
it
has
left
off
raining
!
"
<EOS>
she
added
,
rising
and
going
to
look
out
of
the
window
.
  
<EOS>
Happily
it
did
not
rain
the
next
day
,
and
Gwendolen
rode
to
Diplow
on
Criterion
as
she
had
done
on
that
former
day
when
she
returned
with
her
mother
in
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
She
always
felt
the
more
daring
for
being
in
her
riding
-
dress
;
besides
having
the
agreeable
belief
that
she
looked
as
well
as
possible
in
it
 
a
sustaining
consciousness
in
any
meeting
which
seems
formidable
.
<EOS>
Her
anger
toward
Deronda
had
changed
into
a
superstitious
dread
 
due
,
perhaps
,
to
the
coercion
he
had
exercised
over
her
thought
 
lest
the
first
interference
of
his
in
her
life
might
foreshadow
some
future
influence
.
<EOS>
It
is
of
such
stuff
that
superstitions
are
commonly
made
:
an
intense
feeling
about
ourselves
which
makes
the
evening
star
shine
at
us
with
a
threat
,
and
the
blessing
of
a
beggar
encourage
us
.
<EOS>
And
superstitions
carry
consequences
which
often
verify
their
hope
or
their
foreboding
.
  
<EOS>
The
time
before
luncheon
was
taken
up
for
Gwendolen
by
going
over
the
rooms
with
Mrs.
Torrington
and
Mrs.
Davilow
;
and
she
thought
it
likely
that
if
she
saw
Deronda
,
there
would
hardly
be
need
for
more
than
a
bow
between
them
.
<EOS>
She
meant
to
notice
him
as
little
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
And
after
all
she
found
herself
under
an
inward
compulsion
too
strong
for
her
pride
.
<EOS>
From
the
first
moment
of
their
being
in
the
room
together
,
she
seemed
to
herself
to
be
doing
nothing
but
notice
him
;
everything
else
was
automatic
performance
of
an
habitual
part
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
took
his
place
at
lunch
,
Grandcourt
had
said
,
"
Deronda
,
Miss
Harleth
tells
me
you
were
not
introduced
to
her
at
Leubronn
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Harleth
hardly
remembers
me
,
I
imagine
,
"
said
Deronda
,
looking
at
her
quite
simply
,
as
they
bowed
.
<EOS>
"
She
was
intensely
occupied
when
I
saw
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Now
,
did
he
suppose
that
she
had
not
suspected
him
of
being
the
person
who
redeemed
her
necklace
?
  
<EOS>
"
On
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
I
remember
you
very
well
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
feeling
rather
nervous
,
but
governing
herself
and
looking
at
him
in
return
with
new
examination
.
<EOS>
"
You
did
not
approve
of
my
playing
at
roulette
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
did
you
come
to
that
conclusion
?
"
said
Deronda
,
gravely
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
cast
an
evil
eye
on
my
play
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
with
a
turn
of
her
head
and
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
I
began
to
lose
as
soon
as
you
came
to
look
on
.
<EOS>
I
had
always
been
winning
till
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Roulette
in
such
a
kennel
as
Leubronn
is
a
horrid
bore
,
"
said
Grandcourt
.
  
<EOS>
"
_
I
_
found
it
a
bore
when
I
began
to
lose
,
"
said
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
Her
face
was
turned
toward
Grandcourt
as
she
smiled
and
spoke
,
but
she
gave
a
sidelong
glance
at
Deronda
,
and
saw
his
eyes
fixed
on
her
with
a
look
so
gravely
penetrating
that
it
had
a
keener
edge
for
her
than
his
ironical
smile
at
her
losses
 
<EOS>
a
keener
edge
than
Klesmer
's
judgment
.
<EOS>
She
wheeled
her
neck
round
as
if
she
wanted
to
listen
to
what
was
being
said
by
the
rest
,
while
she
was
only
thinking
of
Deronda
.
<EOS>
His
face
had
that
disturbing
kind
of
form
and
expression
which
threatens
to
affect
opinion
 
as
if
one
's
standard
was
somehow
wrong
.
<EOS>
(
Who
has
not
seen
men
with
faces
of
this
corrective
power
till
they
frustrated
it
by
speech
or
action
?
)
<EOS>
His
voice
,
heard
now
for
the
first
time
,
was
to
Grandcourt
's
toneless
drawl
,
which
had
been
in
her
ears
every
day
,
as
the
deep
notes
of
a
violoncello
to
the
broken
discourse
of
poultry
and
other
lazy
gentry
in
the
afternoon
sunshine
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
,
she
inwardly
conjectured
,
was
perhaps
right
in
saying
that
Deronda
thought
too
much
of
himself
:
 
a
favorite
way
of
explaining
a
superiority
that
humiliates
.
<EOS>
However
the
talk
turned
on
the
rinderpest
and
Jamaica
,
and
no
more
was
said
about
roulette
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
held
that
the
Jamaica
negro
was
a
beastly
sort
of
baptist
Caliban
;
Deronda
said
he
had
always
felt
a
little
with
Caliban
,
who
naturally
had
his
own
point
of
view
and
could
sing
a
good
song
;
Mrs.
Davilow
observed
that
her
father
had
an
estate
in
Barbadoes
,
but
that
she
herself
had
never
been
in
the
West
Indies
;
Mrs.
Torrington
was
sure
she
should
never
sleep
in
her
bed
if
she
lived
among
blacks
;
her
husband
corrected
her
by
saying
that
the
blacks
would
be
manageable
enough
if
it
were
not
for
the
half
-
breeds
;
and
Deronda
remarked
that
the
whites
had
to
thank
themselves
for
the
half
-
breeds
.
  
<EOS>
While
this
polite
pea
-
shooting
was
going
on
,
Gwendolen
trifled
with
her
jelly
,
and
looked
at
every
speaker
in
turn
that
she
might
feel
at
ease
in
looking
at
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
what
he
thinks
of
me
,
really
?
<EOS>
He
must
have
felt
interested
in
me
,
else
he
would
not
have
sent
me
my
necklace
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
he
thinks
of
my
marriage
?
<EOS>
What
notions
has
he
to
make
him
so
grave
about
things
?
<EOS>
Why
is
he
come
to
Diplow
?
"
  
<EOS>
These
questions
ran
in
her
mind
as
the
voice
of
an
uneasy
longing
to
be
judged
by
Deronda
with
unmixed
admiration
 
a
longing
which
had
had
its
seed
in
her
first
resentment
at
his
critical
glance
.
<EOS>
Why
did
she
care
so
much
about
the
opinion
of
this
man
who
was
"
nothing
of
any
consequence
"
?
<EOS>
She
had
no
time
to
find
the
reason
 
she
was
too
much
engaged
in
caring
.
<EOS>
In
the
drawing
-
room
,
when
something
had
called
Grandcourt
away
,
she
went
quite
unpremeditatedly
up
to
Deronda
,
who
was
standing
at
a
table
apart
,
turning
over
some
prints
,
and
said
to
him
    
"
Shall
you
hunt
to
-
morrow
,
Mr.
Deronda
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
believe
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
object
to
hunting
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
find
excuses
for
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
sin
I
am
inclined
to
 
when
I
ca
n't
get
boating
or
cricketing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
object
to
my
hunting
?
"
said
Gwendolen
,
with
a
saucy
movement
of
the
chin
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
right
to
object
to
anything
you
choose
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
thought
you
had
a
right
to
object
to
my
gambling
,
"
persisted
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
sorry
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
aware
that
I
told
you
of
my
objection
,
"
said
Deronda
,
with
his
usual
directness
of
gaze
 
<EOS>
a
large
-
eyed
gravity
,
innocent
of
any
intention
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
had
a
peculiarity
which
has
drawn
many
men
into
trouble
;
they
were
of
a
dark
yet
mild
intensity
which
seemed
to
express
a
special
interest
in
every
one
on
whom
he
fixed
them
,
and
might
easily
help
to
bring
on
him
those
claims
which
ardently
sympathetic
people
are
often
creating
in
the
minds
of
those
who
need
help
.
<EOS>
In
mendicant
fashion
we
make
the
goodness
of
others
a
reason
for
exorbitant
demands
on
them
.
<EOS>
That
sort
of
effect
was
penetrating
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
hindered
me
from
gambling
again
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
no
sooner
spoken
than
she
blushed
over
face
and
neck
;
and
Deronda
blushed
,
too
,
conscious
that
in
the
little
affair
of
the
necklace
he
had
taken
a
questionable
freedom
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
speak
further
;
and
she
turned
away
to
a
window
,
feeling
that
she
had
stupidly
said
what
she
had
not
meant
to
say
,
and
yet
being
rather
happy
that
she
had
plunged
into
this
mutual
understanding
.
<EOS>
Deronda
also
did
not
like
it
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
seemed
more
decidedly
attractive
than
before
;
and
certainly
there
had
been
changes
going
on
within
her
since
that
time
at
Leubronn
:
<EOS>
the
struggle
of
mind
attending
a
conscious
error
had
wakened
something
like
a
new
soul
,
which
had
better
,
but
also
worse
,
possibilities
than
her
former
poise
of
crude
self
-
confidence
:
among
the
forces
she
had
come
to
dread
was
something
within
her
that
troubled
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
That
evening
Mrs.
Davilow
said
,
"
Was
it
really
so
,
or
only
a
joke
of
yours
,
about
Mr.
Deronda
's
spoiling
your
play
,
Gwen
?
"
  
<EOS>
Her
curiosity
had
been
excited
,
and
she
could
venture
to
ask
a
question
that
did
not
concern
Mr.
Grandcourt
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
merely
happened
that
he
was
looking
on
when
I
began
to
lose
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
carelessly
.
<EOS>
"
I
noticed
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
wonder
at
that
:
he
is
a
striking
young
man
.
<EOS>
He
puts
me
in
mind
of
Italian
paintings
.
<EOS>
One
would
guess
,
without
being
told
,
that
there
was
foreign
blood
in
his
veins
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
there
?
"
said
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Torrington
says
so
.
<EOS>
I
asked
particularly
who
he
was
,
and
she
told
me
that
his
mother
was
some
foreigner
of
high
rank
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
mother
?
"
said
Gwendolen
,
rather
sharply
.
<EOS>
"
Then
who
was
his
father
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
 
every
one
says
he
is
the
son
of
Sir
Hugo
Mallinger
,
who
brought
him
up
;
though
he
passes
for
a
ward
.
<EOS>
She
says
,
if
Sir
Hugo
Mallinger
could
have
done
as
he
liked
with
his
estates
,
he
would
have
left
them
to
this
Mr.
Deronda
,
since
he
has
no
legitimate
son
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
was
silent
;
but
her
mother
observed
so
marked
an
effect
in
her
face
that
she
was
angry
with
herself
for
having
repeated
Mrs.
Torrington
's
gossip
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
,
on
reflection
,
unsuited
to
the
ear
of
her
daughter
,
for
whom
Mrs.
Davilow
disliked
what
is
called
knowledge
of
the
world
;
and
indeed
she
wished
that
she
herself
had
not
had
any
of
it
thrust
upon
her
.
  
<EOS>
An
image
which
had
immediately
arisen
in
Gwendolen
's
mind
was
that
of
the
unknown
mother
 
no
doubt
a
dark
-
eyed
woman
 
probably
sad
.
<EOS>
Hardly
any
face
could
be
less
like
Deronda
's
than
that
represented
as
Sir
Hugo
's
in
a
crayon
portrait
at
Diplow
.
<EOS>
A
dark
-
eyed
woman
,
no
longer
young
,
had
become
"
stuff
o
'
the
conscience
"
to
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
That
night
when
she
had
got
into
her
little
bed
,
and
only
a
dim
light
was
burning
,
she
said
    
"
Mamma
,
have
men
generally
children
before
they
are
married
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
dear
,
no
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
.
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
ask
such
a
question
?
"
<EOS>
(
But
she
began
to
think
that
she
saw
the
why
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
If
it
were
so
,
I
ought
to
know
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
with
some
indignation
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
thinking
of
what
I
said
about
Mr.
Deronda
and
Sir
Hugo
Mallinger
.
<EOS>
That
is
a
very
unusual
case
,
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Does
Lady
Mallinger
know
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
knows
enough
to
satisfy
her
.
<EOS>
That
is
quite
clear
,
because
Mr.
Deronda
has
lived
with
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
people
think
no
worse
of
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
of
course
he
is
under
some
disadvantage
:
it
is
not
as
if
he
were
Lady
Mallinger
's
son
.
<EOS>
He
does
not
inherit
the
property
,
and
he
is
not
of
any
consequence
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
But
people
are
not
obliged
to
know
anything
about
his
birth
;
you
see
,
he
is
very
well
received
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
he
knows
about
it
;
and
whether
he
is
angry
with
his
father
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
child
,
why
should
you
think
of
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
said
Gwendolen
,
impetuously
,
sitting
up
in
her
bed
.
"
<EOS>
Have
n't
children
reason
to
be
angry
with
their
parents
?
<EOS>
How
can
they
help
their
parents
marrying
or
not
marrying
?
"
  
<EOS>
But
a
consciousness
rushed
upon
her
,
which
made
her
fall
back
again
on
her
pillow
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
only
what
she
would
have
felt
months
before
 
that
she
might
seem
to
be
reproaching
her
mother
for
that
second
marriage
of
hers
;
what
she
chiefly
felt
now
was
,
that
she
had
been
led
on
to
a
condemnation
which
seemed
to
make
her
own
marriage
a
forbidden
thing
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
further
talk
,
and
till
sleep
came
over
her
Gwendolen
lay
struggling
with
the
reasons
against
that
marriage
 
reasons
which
pressed
upon
her
newly
now
that
they
were
unexpectedly
mirrored
in
the
story
of
a
man
whose
slight
relations
with
her
had
,
by
some
hidden
affinity
,
bitten
themselves
into
the
most
permanent
layers
of
feeling
.
<EOS>
It
was
characteristic
that
,
with
all
her
debating
,
she
was
never
troubled
by
the
question
whether
the
indefensibleness
of
her
marriage
did
not
include
the
fact
that
she
had
accepted
Grandcourt
solely
as
a
man
whom
it
was
convenient
for
her
to
marry
,
not
in
the
least
as
one
to
whom
she
would
be
binding
herself
in
duty
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
ideas
were
pitiably
crude
;
but
many
grand
difficulties
of
life
are
apt
to
force
themselves
on
us
in
our
crudity
.
<EOS>
And
to
judge
wisely
,
I
suppose
we
must
know
how
things
appear
to
the
unwise
;
that
kind
of
appearance
making
the
larger
part
of
the
world
's
history
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
morning
there
was
a
double
excitement
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
going
to
hunt
,
from
which
scruples
about
propriety
had
threatened
to
hinder
her
,
until
it
was
found
that
Mrs.
Torrington
was
horsewoman
enough
to
accompany
her
 
going
to
hunt
for
the
first
time
since
her
escapade
with
Rex
;
and
she
was
going
again
to
see
Deronda
,
in
whom
,
since
last
night
,
her
interest
had
so
gathered
that
she
expected
,
as
people
do
about
revealed
celebrities
,
to
see
something
in
his
appearance
which
she
had
missed
before
.
  
<EOS>
What
was
he
going
to
be
?
<EOS>
What
sort
of
life
had
he
before
him
 
he
being
nothing
of
any
consequence
?
<EOS>
And
with
only
a
little
difference
in
events
he
might
have
been
as
important
as
Grandcourt
,
nay
 
<EOS>
her
imagination
inevitably
went
into
that
direction
 
might
have
held
the
very
estates
which
Grandcourt
was
to
have
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
Deronda
would
probably
some
day
see
her
mistress
of
the
Abbey
at
Topping
,
see
her
bearing
the
title
which
would
have
been
his
own
wife
's
.
<EOS>
These
obvious
,
futile
thoughts
of
what
might
have
been
,
made
a
new
epoch
for
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
She
,
whose
unquestionable
habit
it
had
been
to
take
the
best
that
came
to
her
for
less
than
her
own
claim
,
had
now
to
see
the
position
which
tempted
her
in
a
new
light
,
as
a
hard
,
unfair
exclusion
of
others
.
<EOS>
What
she
had
now
heard
about
Deronda
seemed
to
her
imagination
to
throw
him
into
one
group
with
Mrs.
Glasher
and
her
children
;
before
whom
she
felt
herself
in
an
attitude
of
apology
 
she
who
had
hitherto
been
surrounded
by
a
group
that
in
her
opinion
had
need
be
apologetic
to
her
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
Deronda
himself
was
thinking
of
these
things
.
<EOS>
Could
he
know
of
Mrs.
Glasher
?
<EOS>
If
he
knew
that
she
knew
,
he
would
despise
her
;
but
he
could
have
no
such
knowledge
.
<EOS>
Would
he
,
without
that
,
despise
her
for
marrying
Grandcourt
?
<EOS>
His
possible
judgment
of
her
actions
was
telling
on
her
as
importunately
as
Klesmer
's
judgment
of
her
powers
;
but
she
found
larger
room
for
resistance
to
a
disapproval
of
her
marriage
,
because
it
is
easier
to
make
our
conduct
seem
justifiable
to
ourselves
than
to
make
our
ability
strike
others
.
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
help
it
?
"
is
not
our
favorite
apology
for
incompetency
.
<EOS>
But
Gwendolen
felt
some
strength
in
saying
    
"
How
can
I
help
what
other
people
have
done
?
<EOS>
Things
would
not
come
right
if
I
were
to
turn
round
now
and
declare
that
I
would
not
marry
Mr.
Grandcourt
.
"
<EOS>
And
such
turning
round
was
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
The
horses
in
the
chariot
she
had
mounted
were
going
at
full
speed
.
  
<EOS>
This
mood
of
youthful
,
elated
desperation
had
a
tidal
recurrence
.
<EOS>
She
could
dare
anything
that
lay
before
her
sooner
than
she
could
choose
to
go
backward
,
into
humiliation
;
and
it
was
even
soothing
to
think
that
there
would
now
be
as
much
ill
-
doing
in
the
one
as
in
the
other
.
<EOS>
But
the
immediate
delightful
fact
was
the
hunt
,
where
she
would
see
Deronda
,
and
where
he
would
see
her
;
for
always
lurking
ready
to
obtrude
before
other
thoughts
about
him
was
the
impression
that
he
was
very
much
interested
in
her
.
<EOS>
But
to
-
day
she
was
resolved
not
to
repeat
her
folly
of
yesterday
,
as
if
she
were
anxious
to
say
anything
to
him
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
hunt
would
be
too
absorbing
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
it
was
for
a
long
while
.
<EOS>
Deronda
was
there
,
and
within
her
sight
very
often
;
but
this
only
added
to
the
stimulus
of
a
pleasure
which
Gwendolen
had
only
once
before
tasted
,
and
which
seemed
likely
always
to
give
a
delight
independent
of
any
crosses
,
except
such
as
took
away
the
chance
of
riding
.
<EOS>
No
accident
happened
to
throw
them
together
;
the
run
took
them
within
convenient
reach
of
home
,
and
the
agreeable
sombreness
of
the
gray
November
afternoon
,
with
a
long
stratum
of
yellow
light
in
the
west
,
Gwendolen
was
returning
with
the
company
from
Diplow
,
who
were
attending
her
on
the
way
to
Offendene
.
<EOS>
Now
the
sense
of
glorious
excitement
was
over
and
gone
,
she
was
getting
irritably
disappointed
that
she
had
had
no
opportunity
of
speaking
to
Deronda
,
whom
she
would
not
see
again
,
since
he
was
to
go
away
in
a
couple
of
days
.
<EOS>
What
was
she
going
to
say
?
<EOS>
That
was
not
quite
certain
.
<EOS>
She
wanted
to
speak
to
him
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
was
by
her
side
;
Mrs.
Torrington
,
her
husband
,
and
another
gentleman
in
advance
;
and
Deronda
's
horse
she
could
hear
behind
.
<EOS>
The
wish
to
speak
to
him
and
have
him
speaking
to
her
was
becoming
imperious
;
and
there
was
no
chance
of
it
unless
she
simply
asserted
her
will
and
defied
everything
.
<EOS>
Where
the
order
of
things
could
give
way
to
Miss
Gwendolen
,
it
must
be
made
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
They
had
lately
emerged
from
a
wood
of
pines
and
beeches
,
where
the
twilight
stillness
had
a
repressing
effect
,
which
increased
her
impatience
.
<EOS>
The
horse
-
hoofs
again
heard
behind
at
some
little
distance
were
a
growing
irritation
.
<EOS>
She
reined
in
her
horse
and
looked
behind
her
;
Grandcourt
after
a
few
paces
,
also
paused
;
but
she
,
waving
her
whip
and
nodding
sideways
with
playful
imperiousness
,
said
,
"
Go
on
!
<EOS>
I
want
to
speak
to
Mr.
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
hesitated
;
but
that
he
would
have
done
after
any
proposition
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
awkward
situation
for
him
.
<EOS>
No
gentleman
,
before
marriage
;
could
give
the
emphasis
of
refusal
to
a
command
delivered
in
this
playful
way
.
<EOS>
He
rode
on
slowly
,
and
she
waited
till
Deronda
came
up
.
<EOS>
He
looked
at
her
with
tacit
inquiry
,
and
she
said
at
once
,
letting
her
horse
go
alongside
of
his
    
"
Mr.
Deronda
,
you
must
enlighten
my
ignorance
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
know
why
you
thought
it
wrong
for
me
to
gamble
.
<EOS>
Is
it
because
I
am
a
woman
?
"
  
"
Not
altogether
;
but
I
regretted
it
the
more
because
you
were
a
woman
,
"
said
Deronda
,
with
an
irrepressible
smile
.
<EOS>
Apparently
it
must
be
understood
between
them
now
that
it
was
he
who
sent
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
would
be
better
for
men
not
to
gamble
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
besotting
kind
of
taste
,
likely
to
turn
into
a
disease
.
<EOS>
And
,
besides
,
there
is
something
revolting
to
me
in
raking
a
heap
of
money
together
,
and
internally
chuckling
over
it
,
when
others
are
feeling
the
loss
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
should
even
call
it
base
,
if
it
were
more
than
an
exceptional
lapse
.
<EOS>
There
are
enough
inevitable
turns
of
fortune
which
force
us
to
see
that
our
gain
is
another
's
loss
:
 
that
is
one
of
the
ugly
aspects
of
life
.
<EOS>
One
would
like
to
reduce
it
as
much
as
one
<EOS>
could
,
not
get
amusement
out
of
exaggerating
it
.
<EOS>
"
Deronda
's
voice
had
gathered
some
indignation
while
he
was
speaking
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
do
admit
that
we
ca
n't
help
things
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
with
a
drop
in
her
tone
.
<EOS>
The
answer
had
not
been
anything
like
what
she
had
expected
.
<EOS>
"
I
mean
that
things
are
so
in
spite
of
us
;
we
ca
n't
always
help
it
that
our
gain
is
another
's
loss
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Clearly
.
<EOS>
Because
of
that
,
we
should
help
it
where
we
can
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
biting
her
lip
inside
,
paused
a
moment
,
and
then
forcing
herself
to
speak
with
an
air
of
playfulness
again
,
said
    
"
<EOS>
But
why
should
you
regret
it
more
because
I
am
a
woman
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Perhaps
because
we
need
that
you
should
be
better
than
we
are
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
suppose
_
we
_
need
that
men
should
be
better
than
we
are
,
"
said
Gwendolen
with
a
little
air
of
"
check
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
rather
a
difficulty
,
"
said
Deronda
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
should
have
said
,
we
each
of
us
think
it
would
be
better
for
the
other
to
be
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
I
needed
you
to
be
better
than
I
was
 
<EOS>
and
you
thought
so
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
nodding
and
laughing
,
while
she
put
her
horse
forward
and
joined
Grandcourt
,
who
made
no
observation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
want
to
know
what
I
had
to
say
to
Mr.
Deronda
?
"
said
Gwendolen
,
whose
own
pride
required
her
to
account
for
her
conduct
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
 
no
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
coldly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
that
is
the
first
impolite
word
you
have
spoken
 
that
you
do
n't
wish
to
hear
what
I
had
to
say
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
playing
at
a
pout
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
hear
what
you
say
to
me
 
not
to
other
men
,
"
said
Grandcourt
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
wish
to
hear
this
.
<EOS>
I
wanted
to
make
him
tell
me
why
he
objected
to
my
gambling
,
and
he
gave
me
a
little
sermon
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
 
but
excuse
me
the
sermon
.
<EOS>
"
If
Gwendolen
imagined
that
Grandcourt
cared
about
her
speaking
to
Deronda
,
he
wished
her
to
understand
that
she
was
mistaken
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
not
fond
of
being
told
to
ride
on
.
<EOS>
She
saw
he
was
piqued
,
but
did
not
mind
.
<EOS>
She
had
accomplished
her
object
of
speaking
again
to
Deronda
before
he
raised
his
hat
and
turned
with
the
rest
toward
Diplow
,
while
her
lover
attended
her
to
Offendene
,
where
he
was
to
bid
farewell
before
a
whole
day
's
absence
on
the
unspecified
journey
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
had
spoken
truth
in
calling
the
journey
a
bore
:
he
was
going
by
train
to
Gadsmere
.
      
<EOS>
No
penitence
and
no
confessional
,
  
<EOS>
No
priest
ordains
it
,
yet
they
're
forced
to
sit
  
<EOS>
Amid
deep
ashes
of
their
vanished
years
.
   
<EOS>
Imagine
a
rambling
,
patchy
house
,
the
best
part
built
of
gray
stone
,
and
red
-
tiled
,
a
round
tower
jutting
at
one
of
the
corners
,
the
mellow
darkness
of
its
conical
roof
surmounted
by
a
weather
-
cock
making
an
agreeable
object
either
amidst
the
gleams
and
greenth
of
summer
or
the
low
-
hanging
clouds
and
snowy
branches
of
winter
:
<EOS>
the
ground
shady
with
spreading
trees
:
<EOS>
a
great
tree
flourishing
on
one
side
,
backward
some
Scotch
firs
on
a
broken
bank
where
the
roots
hung
naked
,
and
beyond
,
a
rookery
:
on
the
other
side
a
pool
overhung
with
bushes
,
where
the
water
-
fowl
fluttered
and
screamed
:
all
around
,
a
vast
meadow
which
might
be
called
a
park
,
bordered
by
an
old
plantation
and
guarded
by
stone
ledges
which
looked
like
little
prisons
.
<EOS>
Outside
the
gate
the
country
,
once
entirely
rural
and
lovely
,
now
black
with
coal
mines
,
was
chiefly
peopled
by
men
and
brethren
with
candles
stuck
in
their
hats
,
and
with
a
diabolic
complexion
which
laid
them
peculiarly
open
to
suspicion
in
the
eyes
of
the
children
at
Gadsmere
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Glasher
's
four
beautiful
children
,
who
had
dwelt
there
for
about
three
years
.
<EOS>
Now
,
in
November
,
when
the
flower
-
beds
were
empty
,
the
trees
leafless
,
and
the
pool
blackly
shivering
,
one
might
have
said
that
the
place
was
sombrely
in
keeping
with
the
black
roads
and
black
mounds
which
seemed
to
put
the
district
in
mourning
;
 
except
when
the
children
were
playing
on
the
gravel
with
the
dogs
for
their
companions
.
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Glasher
,
under
her
present
circumstances
,
liked
Gadsmere
as
well
as
she
would
have
liked
any
other
abode
.
<EOS>
The
complete
seclusion
of
the
place
,
which
the
unattractiveness
of
the
country
secured
,
was
exactly
to
her
taste
.
<EOS>
When
she
drove
her
two
ponies
with
a
waggonet
full
of
children
,
there
were
no
gentry
in
carriages
to
be
met
,
only
men
of
business
in
gigs
;
at
church
there
were
no
eyes
she
cared
to
avoid
,
for
the
curate
's
wife
and
the
curate
himself
were
either
ignorant
of
anything
to
her
disadvantage
,
or
ignored
it
:
to
them
she
was
simply
a
widow
lady
,
the
tenant
of
Gadsmere
;
and
<EOS>
the
name
of
Grandcourt
was
of
little
interest
in
that
district
compared
with
the
names
of
Fletcher
and
Gawcome
,
the
lessees
of
the
collieries
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
full
ten
years
since
the
elopement
of
an
Irish
officer
's
beautiful
wife
with
young
Grandcourt
,
and
a
consequent
duel
where
the
bullets
wounded
the
air
only
,
had
made
some
little
noise
.
<EOS>
Most
of
those
who
remembered
the
affair
now
wondered
what
had
become
of
that
Mrs.
Glasher
,
whose
beauty
and
brilliancy
had
made
her
rather
conspicuous
to
them
in
foreign
places
,
where
she
was
known
to
be
living
with
young
Grandcourt
.
  
<EOS>
That
he
should
have
disentangled
himself
from
that
connection
seemed
only
natural
and
desirable
.
<EOS>
As
to
her
,
it
was
thought
that
a
woman
who
was
understood
to
have
forsaken
her
child
along
with
her
husband
had
probably
sunk
lower
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
had
of
course
got
weary
of
her
.
<EOS>
He
was
much
given
to
the
pursuit
of
women
:
but
a
man
in
his
position
would
by
this
time
desire
to
make
a
suitable
marriage
with
the
fair
young
daughter
of
a
noble
house
.
<EOS>
No
one
talked
of
Mrs.
Glasher
now
,
any
more
than
they
talked
of
the
victim
in
a
trial
for
manslaughter
ten
years
before
:
she
was
a
lost
vessel
after
whom
nobody
would
send
out
an
expedition
of
search
;
but
Grandcourt
was
seen
in
harbor
with
his
colors
flying
,
registered
as
seaworthy
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
,
in
fact
,
Grandcourt
had
never
disentangled
himself
from
Mrs.
Glasher
.
<EOS>
His
passion
for
her
had
been
the
strongest
and
most
lasting
he
had
ever
known
;
and
though
it
was
now
as
dead
as
the
music
of
a
cracked
flute
,
it
had
left
a
certain
dull
disposedness
,
which
,
on
the
death
of
her
husband
three
years
before
,
had
prompted
in
him
a
vacillating
notion
of
marrying
her
,
in
accordance
with
the
understanding
often
expressed
between
them
during
the
days
of
his
first
ardor
.
<EOS>
At
that
early
time
Grandcourt
would
willingly
have
paid
for
the
freedom
to
be
won
by
a
divorce
;
but
the
husband
would
not
oblige
him
,
not
wanting
to
be
married
again
himself
,
and
not
wishing
to
have
his
domestic
habits
printed
in
evidence
.
  
<EOS>
The
altered
poise
which
the
years
had
brought
in
Mrs.
Glasher
was
just
the
reverse
.
<EOS>
At
first
she
was
comparatively
careless
about
the
possibility
of
marriage
.
<EOS>
It
was
enough
that
she
had
escaped
from
a
disagreeable
husband
and
found
a
sort
of
bliss
with
a
lover
who
had
completely
fascinated
her
 
young
,
handsome
,
amorous
,
and
living
in
the
best
style
,
with
equipage
and
conversation
of
the
kind
to
be
expected
in
young
men
of
fortune
who
have
seen
everything
.
<EOS>
She
was
an
impassioned
,
vivacious
woman
,
fond
of
adoration
,
exasperated
by
five
years
of
marital
rudeness
;
and
the
sense
of
release
was
so
strong
upon
her
that
it
stilled
anxiety
for
more
than
she
actually
enjoyed
.
<EOS>
An
equivocal
position
was
of
no
importance
to
her
then
;
she
had
no
envy
for
the
honors
of
a
dull
,
disregarded
wife
:
the
one
spot
which
spoiled
her
vision
of
her
new
pleasant
world
,
was
the
sense
that
she
left
her
three
-
year
-
old
boy
,
who
died
two
years
afterward
,
and
whose
first
tones
saying
"
mamma
"
retained
a
difference
from
those
of
the
children
that
came
after
.
<EOS>
But
now
the
years
had
brought
many
changes
besides
those
in
the
contour
of
her
cheek
and
throat
;
and
that
Grandcourt
should
marry
her
had
become
her
dominant
desire
.
<EOS>
The
equivocal
position
which
she
had
not
minded
about
for
herself
was
now
telling
upon
her
through
her
children
,
whom
she
loved
with
a
devotion
charged
with
the
added
passion
of
atonement
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
repentance
except
in
this
direction
.
<EOS>
If
Grandcourt
married
her
,
the
children
would
be
none
the
worse
off
for
what
had
passed
:
they
would
see
their
mother
in
a
dignified
position
,
and
they
would
be
at
no
disadvantage
with
the
world
:
her
son
could
be
made
his
father
's
heir
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
yearning
for
this
result
which
gave
the
supreme
importance
to
Grandcourt
's
feeling
for
her
;
her
love
for
him
had
long
resolved
itself
into
anxiety
that
he
should
give
her
the
unique
,
permanent
claim
of
a
wife
,
and
she
expected
no
other
happiness
in
marriage
than
the
satisfaction
of
her
maternal
love
and
pride
 
including
her
pride
for
herself
in
the
presence
of
her
children
.
<EOS>
For
the
sake
of
that
result
she
was
prepared
even
with
a
tragic
firmness
to
endure
anything
quietly
in
marriage
;
and
she
had
acuteness
enough
to
cherish
Grandcourt
's
flickering
purpose
negatively
,
by
not
molesting
him
with
passionate
appeals
and
with
scene
-
making
.
<EOS>
In
her
,
as
in
every
one
else
who
wanted
anything
of
him
,
his
incalculable
turns
,
and
his
tendency
to
harden
under
beseeching
,
had
created
a
reasonable
dread
:
 
a
slow
discovery
,
of
which
no
presentiment
had
been
given
in
the
bearing
of
a
youthful
lover
with
a
fine
line
of
face
and
the
softest
manners
.
<EOS>
But
reticence
had
necessarily
cost
something
to
this
impassioned
woman
,
and
she
was
the
bitterer
for
it
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
quailing
 
even
that
forced
on
the
helpless
and
injured
 
which
has
not
an
ugly
obverse
:
the
withheld
sting
was
gathering
venom
.
<EOS>
She
was
absolutely
dependent
on
Grandcourt
;
for
though
he
had
been
always
liberal
in
expenses
for
her
,
he
had
kept
everything
voluntary
on
his
part
;
and
with
the
goal
of
marriage
before
her
,
she
would
ask
for
nothing
less
.
<EOS>
He
had
said
that
he
would
never
settle
anything
except
by
will
;
and
when
she
was
thinking
of
alternatives
for
the
future
it
often
occurred
to
her
that
,
even
if
she
did
not
become
Grandcourt
's
wife
,
he
might
never
have
a
son
who
would
have
a
legitimate
claim
on
him
,
and
the
end
might
be
that
her
son
would
be
made
heir
to
the
best
part
of
his
estates
.
<EOS>
No
son
at
that
early
age
could
promise
to
have
more
of
his
father
's
physique
.
<EOS>
But
her
becoming
Grandcourt
's
wife
was
so
far
from
being
an
extravagant
notion
of
possibility
,
that
even
Lush
had
entertained
it
,
and
had
said
that
he
would
as
soon
bet
on
it
as
on
any
other
likelihood
with
regard
to
his
familiar
companion
.
<EOS>
Lush
,
indeed
,
on
inferring
that
Grandcourt
had
a
preconception
of
using
his
residence
at
Diplow
in
order
to
win
Miss
Arrowpoint
,
had
thought
it
well
to
fan
that
project
,
taking
it
as
a
tacit
renunciation
of
the
marriage
with
Mrs.
Glasher
,
which
had
long
been
a
mark
for
the
hovering
and
wheeling
of
Grandcourt
's
caprice
.
<EOS>
But
both
prospects
had
been
negatived
by
Gwendolen
's
appearance
on
the
scene
;
and
it
was
natural
enough
for
Mrs.
Glasher
to
enter
with
eagerness
into
Lush
's
plan
of
hindering
that
new
danger
by
setting
up
a
barrier
in
the
mind
of
the
girl
who
was
being
sought
as
a
bride
.
<EOS>
She
entered
into
it
with
an
eagerness
which
had
passion
in
it
as
well
as
purpose
,
some
of
the
stored
-
up
venom
delivering
itself
in
that
way
.
  
<EOS>
After
that
,
she
had
heard
from
Lush
of
Gwendolen
's
departure
,
and
the
probability
that
all
danger
from
her
was
got
rid
of
;
but
there
had
been
no
letter
to
tell
her
that
the
danger
had
returned
and
had
become
a
certainty
.
<EOS>
She
had
since
then
written
to
Grandcourt
,
as
she
did
habitually
,
and
he
had
been
longer
than
usual
in
answering
.
<EOS>
She
was
inferring
that
he
might
intend
coming
to
Gadsmere
at
the
time
when
he
was
actually
on
the
way
;
and
she
was
not
without
hope
 
<EOS>
what
construction
of
another
's
mind
is
not
strong
wishing
equal
to
?
 
<EOS>
that
a
certain
sickening
from
that
frustrated
courtship
might
dispose
him
to
slip
the
more
easily
into
the
old
track
of
intention
.
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
had
two
grave
purposes
in
coming
to
Gadsmere
:
to
convey
the
news
of
his
approaching
marriage
in
person
,
in
order
to
make
this
first
difficulty
final
;
and
to
get
from
Lydia
his
mother
's
diamonds
,
which
long
ago
he
had
confided
to
her
and
wished
her
to
wear
.
<EOS>
Her
person
suited
diamonds
,
and
made
them
look
as
if
they
were
worth
some
of
the
money
given
for
them
.
<EOS>
These
particular
diamonds
were
not
mountains
of
light
 
<EOS>
they
were
mere
peas
and
haricots
for
the
ears
,
neck
and
hair
;
but
they
were
worth
some
thousands
,
and
Grandcourt
necessarily
wished
to
have
them
for
his
wife
.
<EOS>
Formerly
when
he
had
asked
Lydia
to
put
them
into
his
keeping
again
,
simply
on
the
ground
that
they
would
be
safer
and
ought
to
be
deposited
at
the
bank
,
she
had
quietly
but
absolutely
refused
,
declaring
that
they
were
quite
safe
;
and
at
last
had
said
,
"
If
you
ever
marry
another
woman
I
will
give
them
up
to
her
:
are
you
going
to
marry
another
woman
?
<EOS>
"
At
that
time
Grandcourt
had
no
motive
which
urged
him
to
persist
,
and
he
had
this
grace
in
him
,
that
the
disposition
to
exercise
power
either
by
cowing
or
disappointing
others
or
exciting
in
them
a
rage
which
they
dared
not
express
 
a
disposition
which
was
active
in
him
as
other
propensities
became
languid
 
had
always
been
in
abeyance
before
Lydia
.
<EOS>
A
severe
interpreter
might
say
that
the
mere
facts
of
their
relation
to
each
other
,
the
melancholy
position
of
this
woman
who
depended
on
his
will
,
made
a
standing
banquet
for
his
delight
in
dominating
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
something
else
than
this
in
his
forbearance
toward
her
:
there
was
the
surviving
though
metamorphosed
effect
of
the
power
she
had
had
over
him
;
and
it
was
this
effect
,
the
fitful
dull
lapse
toward
solicitations
that
once
had
the
zest
now
missing
from
life
,
which
had
again
and
again
inclined
him
to
espouse
a
familiar
past
rather
than
rouse
himself
to
the
expectation
of
novelty
.
<EOS>
But
now
novelty
had
taken
hold
of
him
and
urged
him
to
make
the
most
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Glasher
was
seated
in
the
pleasant
room
where
she
habitually
passed
her
mornings
with
her
children
round
her
.
<EOS>
It
had
a
square
projecting
window
and
looked
on
broad
gravel
and
grass
,
sloping
toward
a
little
brook
that
entered
the
pool
.
<EOS>
The
top
of
a
low
,
black
cabinet
,
the
old
oak
table
,
the
chairs
in
tawny
leather
,
were
littered
with
the
children
's
toys
,
books
and
garden
garments
,
at
which
a
maternal
lady
in
pastel
looked
down
from
the
walls
with
smiling
indulgence
.
<EOS>
The
children
were
all
there
.
<EOS>
The
three
girls
,
seated
round
<EOS>
their
mother
near
the
widow
,
were
miniature
portraits
of
her
 
dark
-
eyed
,
delicate
-
featured
brunettes
with
a
rich
bloom
on
their
cheeks
,
their
little
nostrils
and
eyebrows
singularly
finished
as
if
they
were
tiny
women
,
the
eldest
being
barely
nine
.
<EOS>
The
boy
was
seated
on
the
carpet
at
some
distance
,
bending
his
blonde
head
over
the
animals
from
a
Noah
's
ark
,
admonishing
them
separately
in
a
voice
of
threatening
command
,
and
occasionally
licking
the
spotted
ones
to
see
if
the
colors
would
hold
.
<EOS>
Josephine
,
the
eldest
,
was
having
her
French
lesson
;
and
the
others
,
with
their
dolls
on
their
laps
,
sat
demurely
enough
for
images
of
the
Madonna
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Glasher
's
toilet
had
been
made
very
carefully
 
each
day
now
she
said
to
herself
that
Grandcourt
might
come
in
.
<EOS>
Her
head
,
which
,
spite
of
emaciation
,
had
an
ineffaceable
beauty
in
the
fine
profile
,
crisp
curves
of
hair
,
and
clearly
-
marked
eyebrows
,
rose
impressively
above
her
bronze
-
colored
silk
and
velvet
,
and
the
gold
necklace
which
Grandcourt
had
first
clasped
round
her
neck
years
ago
.
<EOS>
Not
that
she
had
any
pleasure
in
her
toilet
;
her
chief
thought
of
herself
seen
in
the
glass
was
,
"
How
changed
!
"
 
<EOS>
but
such
good
in
life
<EOS>
as
remained
to
her
she
would
keep
.
<EOS>
If
her
chief
wish
were
fulfilled
,
she
could
imagine
herself
getting
the
comeliness
of
a
matron
fit
for
the
highest
rank
.
<EOS>
The
little
faces
beside
her
,
almost
exact
reductions
of
her
own
,
seemed
to
tell
of
the
blooming
curves
which
had
once
been
where
now
was
sunken
pallor
.
<EOS>
But
the
children
kissed
the
pale
cheeks
and
never
found
them
deficient
.
<EOS>
That
love
was
now
the
one
end
of
her
life
.
  
<EOS>
Suddenly
Mrs.
Glasher
turned
away
her
head
from
Josephine
's
book
and
listened
.
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
dear
!
<EOS>
I
think
some
one
is
coming
.
"
  
<EOS>
Henleigh
the
boy
jumped
up
and
said
,
"
Mamma
,
is
it
the
miller
with
my
donkey
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
got
no
answer
,
and
going
up
to
his
mamma
's
knee
repeated
his
question
in
an
insistent
tone
.
<EOS>
But
the
door
opened
,
and
the
servant
announced
Mr.
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Glasher
rose
in
some
agitation
.
<EOS>
Henleigh
frowned
at
him
in
disgust
at
his
not
being
the
miller
,
and
the
three
little
girls
lifted
up
their
dark
eyes
to
him
timidly
.
<EOS>
They
had
none
of
them
any
particular
liking
for
this
friend
of
mamma
's
 
in
fact
,
when
he
had
taken
Mrs.
Glasher
's
hand
and
then
turned
to
put
his
other
hand
on
Henleigh
's
head
,
that
energetic
scion
began
to
beat
the
friend
's
arm
away
with
his
fists
.
<EOS>
The
little
girls
submitted
bashfully
to
be
patted
under
the
chin
and
kissed
,
but
on
the
whole
it
seemed
better
to
send
them
into
the
garden
,
where
they
were
presently
dancing
and
chatting
with
the
dogs
on
the
gravel
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
far
are
you
come
?
"
said
Mrs.
Glasher
,
as
Grandcourt
put
away
his
hat
and
overcoat
.
  
<EOS>
"
From
Diplow
,
"
he
answered
slowly
,
seating
himself
opposite
her
and
looking
at
her
with
an
unnoting
gaze
which
she
noted
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
tired
,
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
I
rested
at
the
Junction
 
a
hideous
hole
.
<EOS>
These
railway
journeys
are
always
a
confounded
bore
.
<EOS>
But
I
had
coffee
and
smoked
.
"
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
drew
out
his
handkerchief
,
rubbed
his
face
,
and
in
returning
the
handkerchief
to
his
pocket
looked
at
his
crossed
knee
and
blameless
boot
,
as
if
any
stranger
were
opposite
to
him
,
instead
of
a
woman
quivering
with
a
suspense
which
every
word
and
look
of
his
was
to
incline
toward
hope
or
dread
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
really
occupied
with
their
interview
and
what
it
was
likely
to
include
.
<EOS>
Imagine
the
difference
in
rate
of
emotion
between
this
woman
whom
the
years
had
worn
to
a
more
conscious
dependence
and
sharper
eagerness
,
and
this
man
whom
they
were
dulling
into
a
more
neutral
obstinacy
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
expected
to
see
you
 
<EOS>
it
was
so
long
since
I
had
heard
from
you
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
weeks
seem
longer
at
Gadsmere
than
they
do
at
Diplow
,
"
said
Mrs.
Glasher
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
quick
,
incisive
way
of
speaking
that
seemed
to
go
with
her
features
,
as
the
tone
and
_
timbre
_
of
a
violin
go
with
its
form
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
drawled
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
found
the
money
paid
into
the
bank
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
"
said
Mrs.
Glasher
,
curtly
,
tingling
with
impatience
.
<EOS>
Always
before
 
at
least
she
fancied
so
 
Grandcourt
had
taken
more
notice
of
her
and
the
children
than
he
did
to
-
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
he
resumed
,
playing
with
his
whisker
,
and
at
first
not
looking
at
her
,
"
the
time
has
gone
on
at
rather
a
rattling
pace
with
me
;
generally
it
is
slow
enough
.
<EOS>
But
there
has
been
a
good
deal
happening
,
as
you
know
"
 
here
he
turned
his
eyes
upon
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
I
know
?
"
said
she
,
sharply
.
  
<EOS>
He
left
a
pause
before
he
said
,
without
change
of
manner
,
"
That
I
was
thinking
of
marrying
.
<EOS>
You
saw
Miss
Harleth
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
_
She
_
told
you
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
pale
cheeks
looked
even
paler
,
perhaps
from
the
fierce
brightness
in
the
eyes
above
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
Lush
told
me
,
"
was
the
slow
answer
.
<EOS>
It
was
as
if
the
thumb
-
screw
and
the
iron
boot
were
being
placed
by
creeping
hands
within
sight
of
the
expectant
victim
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
God
!
<EOS>
say
at
once
that
you
are
going
to
marry
her
,
"
she
burst
out
,
passionately
,
her
knees
shaking
and
her
hands
tightly
clasped
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
this
kind
of
thing
must
happen
some
time
or
other
,
Lydia
,
"
said
he
;
really
,
now
the
thumb
-
screw
was
on
,
not
wishing
to
make
the
pain
worse
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
did
n't
always
see
the
necessity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
not
.
<EOS>
I
see
it
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
In
those
few
under
-
toned
words
of
Grandcourt
's
she
felt
as
absolute
a
resistance
as
if
her
thin
fingers
had
been
pushing
at
a
fast
shut
iron
door
.
<EOS>
She
knew
her
helplessness
,
and
shrank
from
testing
it
by
any
appeal
 
shrank
from
crying
in
a
dead
ear
and
clinging
to
dead
knees
,
only
to
see
the
immovable
face
and
feel
the
rigid
limbs
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
weep
nor
speak
;
she
was
too
hard
pressed
by
the
sudden
certainty
which
had
as
much
of
chill
sickness
in
it
as
of
thought
and
emotion
.
<EOS>
The
defeated
clutch
of
struggling
hope
gave
her
in
these
first
moments
a
horrible
sensation
.
<EOS>
At
last
she
rose
,
with
a
spasmodic
effort
,
and
,
unconscious
of
every
thing
but
her
wretchedness
,
pressed
her
forehead
against
the
hard
,
cold
glass
of
the
window
.
<EOS>
The
children
,
playing
on
the
gravel
,
took
this
as
a
sign
that
she
wanted
them
,
and
,
running
forward
,
stood
in
front
of
her
with
their
sweet
faces
upturned
expectantly
.
<EOS>
This
roused
her
:
she
shook
her
head
at
them
,
waved
them
off
,
and
overcome
with
this
painful
exertion
,
sank
back
in
the
nearest
chair
.
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
had
risen
too
.
<EOS>
He
was
doubly
annoyed
 
at
the
scene
itself
,
and
at
the
sense
that
no
imperiousness
of
his
could
save
him
from
it
;
but
the
task
had
to
be
gone
through
,
and
there
was
the
administrative
necessity
of
arranging
things
so
that
there
should
be
as
little
annoyance
as
possible
in
the
future
.
<EOS>
He
was
leaning
against
the
corner
of
the
fire
-
place
.
<EOS>
She
looked
up
at
him
and
said
,
bitterly
    
"
<EOS>
All
this
is
of
no
consequence
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
and
the
children
are
importunate
creatures
.
<EOS>
You
wish
to
get
away
again
and
be
with
Miss
Harleth
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
make
the
affair
more
disagreeable
than
it
need
be
.
<EOS>
Lydia
.
<EOS>
It
is
of
no
use
to
harp
on
things
that
ca
n't
be
altered
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
its
deucedly
disagreeable
to
me
to
see
you
making
yourself
miserable
.
<EOS>
I
've
taken
this
journey
to
tell
you
what
you
must
make
up
your
mind
to
 
you
and
the
children
will
be
provided
for
as
usual
 
<EOS>
and
there
's
an
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Silence
.
<EOS>
She
dared
not
answer
.
<EOS>
This
woman
with
the
intense
,
eager
look
had
had
the
iron
of
the
mother
's
anguish
in
her
soul
,
and
it
had
made
her
sometimes
capable
of
a
repression
harder
than
shrieking
and
struggle
.
<EOS>
But
underneath
the
silence
there
was
an
outlash
of
hatred
and
vindictiveness
:
she
wished
that
the
marriage
might
make
two
others
wretched
,
besides
herself
.
<EOS>
Presently
he
went
on
    
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
better
for
you
.
<EOS>
You
may
go
on
living
here
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
of
by
-
and
-
by
settling
a
good
sum
on
you
and
the
children
,
and
you
can
live
where
you
like
.
<EOS>
There
will
be
nothing
for
you
to
complain
of
then
.
<EOS>
Whatever
happens
,
you
will
feel
secure
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
done
beforehand
.
<EOS>
Every
thing
has
gone
on
in
a
hurry
.
"
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
ceased
his
slow
delivery
of
sentences
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
expect
her
to
thank
him
,
but
he
considered
that
she
might
reasonably
be
contented
;
if
it
were
possible
for
Lydia
to
be
contented
.
<EOS>
She
showed
no
change
,
and
after
a
minute
he
said
    
"
You
have
never
had
any
reason
to
fear
that
I
should
be
illiberal
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
care
a
curse
about
the
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
did
care
about
it
,
I
suppose
you
would
not
give
it
us
,
"
said
Lydia
.
<EOS>
The
sarcasm
was
irrepressible
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
devilishly
unfair
thing
to
say
,
"
Grandcourt
replied
,
in
a
lower
tone
;
"
and
I
advise
you
not
to
say
that
sort
of
thing
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Should
you
punish
me
by
leaving
the
children
in
beggary
?
"
<EOS>
In
spite
of
herself
,
the
one
outlet
of
venom
had
brought
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
question
about
leaving
the
children
in
beggary
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
still
in
his
low
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
advise
you
not
to
say
things
that
you
will
repent
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
used
to
repenting
,
"
said
she
,
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
will
repent
.
<EOS>
You
have
already
repented
of
loving
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
this
will
only
make
it
uncommonly
difficult
for
us
to
meet
again
.
<EOS>
What
friend
have
you
besides
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
true
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
words
came
like
a
low
moan
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
moment
there
flashed
through
her
the
wish
that
after
promising
himself
a
better
happiness
than
that
he
had
had
with
her
,
he
might
feel
a
misery
and
loneliness
which
would
drive
him
back
to
her
to
find
some
memory
of
a
time
when
he
was
young
,
glad
,
and
hopeful
.
<EOS>
But
no
!
<EOS>
he
would
go
scathless
;
it
was
she
that
had
to
suffer
.
  
<EOS>
With
this
the
scorching
words
were
ended
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
had
meant
to
stay
till
evening
;
he
wished
to
curtail
his
visit
,
but
there
was
no
suitable
train
earlier
than
the
one
he
had
arranged
to
go
by
,
and
he
had
still
to
speak
to
Lydia
on
the
second
object
of
his
visit
,
which
like
a
second
surgical
operation
seemed
to
require
an
interval
.
<EOS>
The
hours
had
to
go
by
;
there
was
eating
to
be
done
;
the
children
came
in
 
<EOS>
all
this
mechanism
of
life
had
to
be
gone
through
with
the
dreary
sense
of
constraint
which
is
often
felt
in
domestic
quarrels
of
a
commoner
kind
.
<EOS>
To
Lydia
it
was
some
slight
relief
for
her
stifled
fury
to
have
the
children
present
:
she
felt
a
savage
glory
in
their
loveliness
,
as
if
it
would
taunt
Grandcourt
with
his
indifference
to
her
<EOS>
and
them
 
<EOS>
a
secret
darting
of
venom
which
was
strongly
imaginative
.
<EOS>
He
acquitted
himself
with
all
the
advantage
of
a
man
whose
grace
of
bearing
has
long
been
moulded
on
an
experience
of
boredom
 
nursed
the
little
Antonia
,
who
sat
with
her
hands
crossed
and
eyes
upturned
to
his
bald
head
,
which
struck
her
as
worthy
of
observation
 
and
propitiated
Henleigh
by
promising
him
a
beautiful
saddle
and
bridle
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
the
two
eldest
girls
who
had
known
him
as
a
continual
presence
;
and
the
intervening
years
had
overlaid
their
infantine
memories
with
a
bashfulness
which
Grandcourt
's
bearing
was
not
likely
to
dissipate
.
<EOS>
He
and
Lydia
occasionally
,
in
the
presence
of
the
servants
,
made
a
conventional
remark
;
otherwise
they
never
spoke
;
and
the
stagnant
thought
in
Grandcourt
's
mind
all
the
while
was
of
his
own
infatuation
in
having
given
her
those
diamonds
,
which
obliged
him
to
incur
the
nuisance
of
speaking
about
them
.
<EOS>
He
had
an
ingrained
care
for
what
he
held
to
belong
to
his
caste
,
and
about
property
he
liked
to
be
lordly
;
also
he
had
a
consciousness
of
indignity
to
himself
in
having
to
ask
for
anything
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
But
however
he
might
assert
his
independence
of
Mrs.
Glasher
's
past
,
he
had
made
a
past
for
himself
which
was
a
stronger
yoke
than
any
he
could
impose
.
<EOS>
He
must
ask
for
the
diamonds
which
he
had
promised
to
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
they
were
alone
again
,
with
the
candles
above
them
,
face
to
face
with
each
other
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
looked
at
his
watch
,
and
then
said
,
in
an
apparently
indifferent
drawl
,
"
There
is
one
thing
I
had
to
mention
,
Lydia
.
<EOS>
My
diamonds
 
<EOS>
you
have
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
have
them
,
"
she
answered
promptly
,
rising
and
standing
with
her
arms
thrust
down
and
her
fingers
threaded
,
while
Grandcourt
sat
still
.
<EOS>
She
had
expected
the
topic
,
and
made
her
resolve
about
it
.
<EOS>
But
she
meant
to
carry
out
her
resolve
,
if
possible
,
without
exasperating
him
.
<EOS>
During
the
hours
of
silence
she
had
longed
to
recall
the
words
which
had
only
widened
the
breach
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
in
this
house
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
not
in
this
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
said
you
kept
them
by
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
I
said
so
it
was
true
.
<EOS>
They
are
in
the
bank
at
Dudley
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Get
them
away
,
will
you
?
<EOS>
I
must
make
an
arrangement
for
your
delivering
them
to
some
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Make
no
arrangement
.
<EOS>
They
shall
be
delivered
to
the
person
you
intended
them
for
.
<EOS>
_
I
_
will
make
the
arrangement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
I
say
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
told
you
that
I
would
give
them
up
to
your
wife
.
<EOS>
I
shall
keep
my
word
.
<EOS>
She
is
not
your
wife
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
foolery
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
with
undertoned
disgust
.
<EOS>
It
was
too
irritating
that
this
indulgence
of
Lydia
had
given
her
a
sort
of
mastery
over
him
in
spite
of
dependent
condition
.
  
<EOS>
She
did
not
speak
.
<EOS>
He
also
rose
now
,
but
stood
leaning
against
the
mantle
-
piece
with
his
side
-
face
toward
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
diamonds
must
be
delivered
to
me
before
my
marriage
,
"
he
began
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
your
wedding
-
day
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
tenth
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
time
to
be
lost
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
where
do
you
go
after
the
marriage
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
did
not
reply
except
by
looking
more
sullen
.
<EOS>
Presently
he
said
,
"
You
must
appoint
a
day
before
then
,
to
get
them
from
the
bank
and
meet
me
 
or
somebody
else
I
will
commission
;
 
it
's
a
great
nuisance
,
Mention
a
day
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
shall
not
do
that
.
<EOS>
They
shall
be
delivered
to
her
safely
.
<EOS>
I
shall
keep
my
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
you
mean
to
say
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
just
audibly
,
turning
to
face
her
,
"
that
you
will
not
do
as
I
tell
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
mean
that
,
"
was
the
answer
that
leaped
out
,
while
her
eyes
flashed
close
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
poor
creature
was
immediately
conscious
that
if
her
words
had
any
effect
on
her
own
lot
,
the
effect
must
be
mischievous
,
and
might
nullify
all
the
remaining
advantage
of
her
long
patience
.
<EOS>
But
the
word
had
been
spoken
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
in
a
position
the
most
irritating
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
shake
her
nor
touch
her
hostilely
;
and
if
he
could
,
the
process
would
not
bring
his
mother
's
diamonds
.
<EOS>
He
shrank
from
the
only
sort
of
threat
that
would
frighten
her
 
if
she
believed
it
.
<EOS>
And
in
general
,
there
was
nothing
he
hated
more
than
to
be
forced
into
anything
like
violence
even
in
words
:
his
will
must
impose
itself
without
trouble
.
<EOS>
After
looking
at
her
for
a
moment
,
he
turned
his
side
-
face
toward
her
again
,
leaning
as
before
,
and
said
    
"
Infernal
idiots
that
women
are
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
will
you
not
tell
me
where
you
are
going
after
the
marriage
?
<EOS>
I
could
be
at
the
wedding
if
I
liked
,
and
learn
in
that
way
,
"
said
Lydia
,
not
shrinking
from
the
one
suicidal
form
of
threat
within
her
power
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
if
you
like
,
you
can
play
the
mad
woman
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
with
_
sotto
voce
_
scorn
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
you
will
wait
to
think
what
good
will
come
of
it
 
or
<EOS>
what
you
owe
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
in
a
state
of
disgust
and
embitterment
quite
new
in
the
history
of
their
relation
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
It
was
undeniable
that
this
woman
,
whose
life
he
had
allowed
to
send
such
deep
suckers
into
his
,
had
a
terrible
power
of
annoyance
in
her
;
and
the
rash
hurry
of
his
proceedings
had
left
her
opportunities
open
.
<EOS>
His
pride
saw
very
ugly
possibilities
threatening
it
,
and
he
stood
for
several
minutes
in
silence
reviewing
the
situation
 
considering
how
he
could
act
upon
her
.
<EOS>
Unlike
himself
she
was
of
a
direct
nature
,
with
certain
simple
strongly
-
colored
tendencies
,
and
there
was
one
often
-
experienced
effect
which
he
thought
he
could
count
upon
now
.
<EOS>
As
Sir
Hugo
had
said
of
him
,
Grandcourt
knew
how
to
play
his
cards
upon
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
He
did
not
speak
again
,
but
looked
at
his
watch
,
rang
the
bell
,
and
ordered
the
vehicle
to
be
brought
round
immediately
.
<EOS>
Then
he
removed
farther
from
her
,
walked
as
if
in
expectation
of
a
summons
,
and
remained
silent
without
turning
his
eyes
upon
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
suffering
the
horrible
conflict
of
self
-
reproach
and
tenacity
.
<EOS>
She
saw
beforehand
Grandcourt
leaving
her
without
even
looking
at
her
again
 
herself
left
behind
in
lonely
uncertainty
 
hearing
nothing
from
him
 
not
knowing
whether
she
had
done
her
children
harm
 
feeling
that
she
had
perhaps
made
him
hate
her
;
 
all
the
wretchedness
of
a
creature
who
had
defeated
her
own
motives
.
<EOS>
And
yet
she
could
not
bear
to
give
up
a
purpose
which
was
a
sweet
morsel
to
her
vindictiveness
.
<EOS>
If
she
had
not
been
a
mother
she
would
willingly
have
sacrificed
herself
to
her
revenge
 
to
what
she
felt
to
be
the
justice
of
hindering
another
from
getting
happiness
by
willingly
giving
her
over
to
misery
.
<EOS>
The
two
dominant
passions
were
at
struggle
.
<EOS>
She
must
satisfy
them
both
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
let
us
part
in
anger
,
Henleigh
,
"
she
began
,
without
changing
her
voice
or
attitude
:
"
it
is
a
very
little
thing
I
ask
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
refusing
to
give
anything
up
<EOS>
that
you
call
yours
<EOS>
it
would
be
different
:
that
would
be
a
reason
for
treating
me
as
if
you
hated
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
ask
such
a
little
thing
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
tell
me
where
you
are
going
on
the
wedding
-
day
<EOS>
I
will
take
care
that
the
diamonds
shall
be
delivered
to
her
without
scandal
.
<EOS>
Without
scandal
,
"
she
repeated
entreatingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Such
preposterous
whims
make
a
woman
odious
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
not
giving
way
in
look
or
movement
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
use
of
talking
to
mad
people
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
am
foolish
 
loneliness
has
made
me
foolish
 
indulge
me
.
"
<EOS>
Sobs
rose
as
she
spoke
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
indulge
me
in
this
one
folly
I
will
be
very
meek
 
I
will
never
trouble
you
.
"
<EOS>
She
burst
into
hysterical
crying
,
and
said
again
almost
with
a
scream
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
very
meek
after
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
strange
mixture
of
acting
and
reality
in
this
passion
.
<EOS>
She
kept
hold
of
her
purpose
as
a
child
might
tighten
its
hand
over
a
small
stolen
thing
,
crying
and
denying
all
the
while
.
<EOS>
Even
Grandcourt
was
wrought
upon
by
surprise
:
this
capricious
wish
,
this
childish
violence
,
was
as
unlike
Lydia
's
bearing
as
it
was
incongruous
with
her
person
.
<EOS>
Both
had
always
had
a
stamp
of
dignity
on
them
.
<EOS>
Yet
she
seemed
more
manageable
in
this
state
than
in
her
former
attitude
of
defiance
.
<EOS>
He
came
close
up
to
her
again
,
and
said
,
in
his
low
imperious
tone
,
"
Be
quiet
,
and
hear
what
I
tell
you
,
I
will
never
forgive
you
if
you
present
yourself
again
and
make
a
scene
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
pressed
her
handkerchief
against
her
face
,
and
when
she
could
speak
firmly
said
,
in
the
muffled
voice
that
follows
sobbing
,
"
I
will
not
 
if
you
will
let
me
have
my
way
 
<EOS>
I
promise
you
not
to
thrust
myself
forward
again
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
broken
my
word
to
you
 
how
many
have
you
broken
to
me
?
<EOS>
When
you
gave
me
the
diamonds
to
wear
you
were
not
thinking
of
having
another
wife
.
<EOS>
And
I
now
give
them
up
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
reproach
you
 
<EOS>
I
only
ask
you
to
let
me
give
them
up
in
my
own
way
.
<EOS>
Have
I
not
borne
it
well
?
<EOS>
Everything
is
to
be
taken
away
from
me
,
and
when
I
ask
for
a
straw
,
a
chip
 
<EOS>
you
deny
it
me
.
<EOS>
"
She
had
spoken
rapidly
,
but
after
a
little
pause
she
said
more
slowly
,
her
voice
freed
from
its
muffled
tone
:
"
I
will
not
bear
to
have
it
denied
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
had
a
baffling
sense
that
he
had
to
deal
with
something
like
madness
;
he
could
only
govern
by
giving
way
.
<EOS>
The
servant
came
to
say
the
fly
was
ready
.
<EOS>
When
the
door
was
shut
again
Grandcourt
said
sullenly
,
"
We
are
going
to
Ryelands
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
They
shall
be
delivered
to
her
there
,
"
said
Lydia
,
with
decision
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
I
am
going
.
"
<EOS>
He
felt
no
inclination
even
to
take
her
hand
:
she
had
annoyed
him
too
sorely
.
<EOS>
But
now
that
she
had
gained
her
point
,
she
was
prepared
to
humble
herself
that
she
might
propitiate
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Forgive
me
;
I
will
never
vex
you
again
,
"
she
said
,
with
beseeching
looks
.
<EOS>
Her
inward
voice
said
distinctly
 
"
It
is
only
I
who
have
to
forgive
.
"
<EOS>
Yet
she
was
obliged
to
ask
forgiveness
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
keep
that
promise
.
<EOS>
You
have
made
me
feel
uncommonly
ill
with
your
folly
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
apparently
choosing
this
statement
as
the
strongest
possible
use
of
language
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
thing
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Lydia
,
with
a
faint
smile
;
 
was
he
aware
of
the
minor
fact
that
he
made
her
feel
ill
this
morning
?
  
<EOS>
But
with
the
quick
transition
natural
to
her
,
she
was
now
ready
to
coax
him
if
he
would
let
her
,
that
they
might
part
in
some
degree
reconciled
.
<EOS>
She
ventured
to
lay
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
,
and
he
did
not
move
away
from
her
:
she
had
so
far
succeeded
in
alarming
him
,
that
he
was
not
sorry
for
these
proofs
of
returned
subjection
.
  
<EOS>
"
Light
a
cigar
,
"
she
said
,
soothingly
,
taking
the
case
from
his
breast
-
pocket
and
opening
it
.
  
<EOS>
Amidst
such
caressing
signs
of
mutual
fear
they
parted
.
<EOS>
The
effect
that
clung
and
gnawed
within
Grandcourt
was
a
sense
of
imperfect
mastery
.
            
<EOS>
"
A
wild
dedication
of
yourselves
  
To
unpath'd
waters
,
undreamed
shores
.

SHAKESPEARE
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
day
when
Gwendolen
Harleth
was
married
and
became
Mrs.
Grandcourt
,
the
morning
was
clear
and
bright
,
and
while
the
sun
was
low
a
slight
frost
crisped
the
leaves
.
<EOS>
The
bridal
party
was
worth
seeing
,
and
half
Pennicote
turned
out
to
see
it
,
lining
the
pathway
up
to
the
church
.
<EOS>
An
old
friend
of
the
rector
's
performed
the
marriage
ceremony
,
the
rector
himself
acting
as
father
,
to
the
great
advantage
of
the
procession
.
<EOS>
Only
two
faces
,
it
was
remarked
,
showed
signs
of
sadness
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
's
and
Anna
's
.
<EOS>
The
mother
's
delicate
eyelids
were
pink
,
as
if
she
had
been
crying
half
the
night
;
and
no
one
was
surprised
that
,
splendid
as
the
match
was
,
she
should
feel
the
parting
from
a
daughter
who
was
the
flower
of
her
children
and
of
her
own
life
.
<EOS>
It
was
less
understood
why
Anna
should
be
troubled
when
she
was
being
so
well
set
off
by
the
bridesmaid
's
dress
.
<EOS>
Every
one
else
seemed
to
reflect
the
brilliancy
of
the
occasion
 
the
bride
most
of
all
.
<EOS>
Of
her
it
was
agreed
that
as
to
figure
and
carriage
<EOS>
she
was
worthy
to
be
a
"
lady
o
'
title
"
:
as
to
face
,
perhaps
it
might
be
thought
that
a
title
required
something
more
rosy
;
but
the
bridegroom
himself
not
being
fresh
-
colored
 
being
indeed
,
as
the
miller
's
wife
observed
,
very
much
of
her
own
husband
's
complexion
 
<EOS>
the
match
was
the
more
complete
.
<EOS>
Anyhow
he
must
be
very
fond
of
her
;
and
it
was
to
be
hoped
that
he
would
never
cast
it
up
to
her
that
she
had
been
going
out
to
service
as
a
governess
,
and
her
mother
to
live
at
Sawyer
's
Cottage
 
vicissitudes
which
had
been
much
spoken
of
in
the
village
.
<EOS>
The
miller
's
daughter
of
fourteen
could
not
believe
that
high
gentry
behaved
badly
to
their
wives
,
but
her
mother
instructed
her
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
child
,
men
's
men
:
gentle
or
simple
,
they
're
much
of
a
muchness
.
<EOS>
I
've
heard
my
mother
say
Squire
Pelton
used
to
take
his
dogs
and
a
long
whip
into
his
wife
's
room
,
and
flog
'em
there
to
frighten
her
;
and
my
mother
was
lady's
-
maid
there
at
the
very
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
unlucky
talk
for
a
wedding
,
Mrs.
Girdle
,
"
said
the
tailor
.
<EOS>
"
A
quarrel
may
end
wi
'
the
whip
,
but
it
begins
wi
'
the
tongue
,
and
it
's
the
women
have
got
the
most
o
'
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
Lord
gave
it
'em
to
use
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Mrs.
Girdle
.
"
<EOS>
_
He
_
never
meant
you
to
have
it
all
your
own
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
what
I
can
make
out
from
the
gentleman
as
attends
to
the
grooming
at
Offendene
,
"
said
the
tailor
,
"
<EOS>
this
Mr.
Grandcourt
has
wonderful
little
tongue
.
<EOS>
Everything
must
be
done
dummy
-
like
without
his
ordering
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
he
's
the
more
whip
,
I
doubt
,
"
said
Mrs.
Girdle
.
"
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
She
's
_
<EOS>
got
tongue
enough
,
I
warrant
her
.
<EOS>
See
,
there
they
come
out
together
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
wonderful
long
corners
she
's
got
to
her
eyes
!
"
said
the
tailor
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
makes
you
feel
comical
when
she
looks
at
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
in
fact
,
never
showed
more
elasticity
in
her
bearing
,
more
lustre
in
her
long
brown
glance
:
she
had
the
brilliancy
of
strong
excitement
,
which
will
sometimes
come
even
from
pain
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
pain
,
however
,
that
she
was
feeling
:
she
had
wrought
herself
up
to
much
the
same
condition
as
that
in
which
she
stood
at
the
gambling
-
table
when
Deronda
was
looking
at
her
,
and
she
began
to
lose
.
<EOS>
There
was
an
enjoyment
in
it
:
whatever
uneasiness
a
growing
conscience
had
created
was
disregarded
as
an
ailment
might
have
been
,
amidst
the
gratification
of
that
ambitious
vanity
and
desire
for
luxury
within
her
which
it
would
take
a
great
deal
of
slow
poisoning
to
kill
.
<EOS>
This
morning
she
could
not
have
said
truly
that
she
repented
her
acceptance
of
Grandcourt
,
or
that
any
fears
in
hazy
perspective
could
hinder
the
glowing
effect
of
the
immediate
scene
in
which
she
was
the
central
object
.
<EOS>
That
she
was
doing
something
wrong
 
that
a
punishment
might
be
hanging
over
her
 
that
the
woman
to
whom
she
had
given
a
promise
and
broken
it
,
was
thinking
of
her
in
bitterness
and
misery
with
a
just
reproach
 
that
Deronda
with
his
way
of
looking
into
things
very
likely
despised
her
for
marrying
Grandcourt
,
as
he
had
despised
her
for
gambling
 
above
all
,
that
the
cord
which
united
her
with
this
lover
and
which
she
had
heretofore
held
by
the
hand
,
was
now
being
flung
over
her
neck
,
 
all
this
yeasty
mingling
of
dimly
understood
facts
with
vague
but
deep
impressions
,
and
with
images
half
real
,
half
fantastic
,
had
been
disturbing
her
during
the
weeks
of
her
engagement
.
<EOS>
Was
that
agitating
experience
nullified
this
morning
?
<EOS>
No
:
it
was
surmounted
and
thrust
down
with
a
sort
of
exulting
defiance
as
she
felt
herself
standing
at
the
game
of
life
with
many
eyes
upon
her
,
daring
everything
to
win
much
 
or
if
to
lose
,
still
with
_
éclat
_
and
a
sense
of
importance
.
<EOS>
But
this
morning
a
losing
destiny
for
herself
did
not
press
upon
her
as
a
fear
:
she
thought
that
she
was
entering
on
a
fuller
power
of
managing
circumstances
 
with
all
the
official
strength
of
marriage
,
which
some
women
made
so
poor
a
use
of
.
<EOS>
That
intoxication
of
youthful
egoism
out
of
which
she
had
been
shaken
by
trouble
,
humiliation
,
and
a
new
sense
of
culpability
,
had
returned
upon
her
under
a
newly
-
fed
strength
of
the
old
fumes
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
in
the
least
present
the
ideal
of
the
tearful
,
tremulous
bride
.
<EOS>
Poor
Gwendolen
,
whom
some
had
judged
much
too
forward
and
instructed
in
the
world
's
ways
!
 
<EOS>
with
her
erect
head
and
elastic
footstep
<EOS>
she
was
walking
among
illusions
;
and
yet
,
too
<EOS>
,
there
was
an
under
-
consciousness
of
her
that
she
was
a
little
intoxicated
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
God
you
bear
it
<EOS>
so
well
,
my
darling
!
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
when
she
had
helped
Gwendolen
to
doff
her
bridal
white
and
put
on
her
traveling
dress
.
<EOS>
All
the
trembling
had
been
done
by
the
poor
mother
,
and
her
agitation
urged
Gwendolen
doubly
to
take
the
morning
as
if
it
were
a
triumph
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
might
have
said
that
,
if
I
had
been
going
to
Mrs.
Mompert
's
,
<EOS>
you
dear
,
sad
,
incorrigible
mamma
!
"
said
Gwendolen
just
putting
her
hands
to
her
mother
's
cheeks
with
laughing
tenderness
 
then
retreating
a
little
and
spreading
out
her
arms
as
if
to
exhibit
herself
:
<EOS>
"
Here
am
I
 
Mrs.
Grandcourt
!
<EOS>
what
else
would
you
have
me
,
but
what
I
am
sure
to
be
?
<EOS>
You
know
you
were
ready
to
die
with
vexation
when
you
thought
that
I
would
not
be
Mrs.
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Hush
,
hush
,
my
child
,
for
heaven
's
sake
!
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
almost
in
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
help
feeling
it
when
I
am
parting
from
you
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
bear
anything
gladly
if
you
are
happy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
gladly
,
mamma
,
no
!
"
said
Gwendolen
,
shaking
her
head
,
with
a
bright
smile
.
<EOS>
"
Willingly
you
would
bear
it
,
but
always
sorrowfully
.
<EOS>
Sorrowing
is
your
sauce
;
you
can
take
nothing
without
it
.
"
<EOS>
Then
,
clasping
her
mother
's
shoulders
and
raining
kisses
first
on
one
cheek
and
then
on
the
other
between
her
words
,
she
said
,
gaily
,
"
And
you
shall
sorrow
over
my
having
everything
at
my
beck
   
and
enjoying
everything
glorious
 
splendid
houses
 
and
horses
 
and
diamonds
,
I
shall
have
diamonds
 
and
going
to
court
 
and
being
Lady
Certainly
 
and
Lady
Perhaps
 
and
grand
here
 
and
tantivy
there
 
and
always
loving
you
better
than
anybody
else
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
sweet
child
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
shall
not
be
jealous
if
you
love
your
husband
better
;
and
he
will
expect
to
be
first
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
thrust
out
her
lips
and
chin
with
a
pretty
grimace
,
saying
,
"
Rather
a
ridiculous
expectation
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
do
n't
mean
to
treat
him
ill
,
unless
he
deserves
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Then
the
two
fell
into
a
clinging
embrace
,
and
Gwendolen
could
not
hinder
a
rising
sob
when
she
said
,
"
I
wish
you
were
going
with
me
,
mamma
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
the
slight
dew
on
her
long
eyelashes
only
made
her
the
more
charming
when
she
gave
her
hand
to
Grandcourt
to
be
led
to
the
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
The
rector
looked
in
on
her
to
give
a
final
"
Good
-
bye
;
God
bless
you
;
we
shall
see
you
again
before
long
,
"
and
then
returned
to
Mrs.
Davilow
,
saying
half
cheerfully
,
half
solemnly
    
<EOS>
"
Let
us
be
thankful
,
Fanny
.
<EOS>
She
is
in
a
position
well
suited
to
her
,
and
beyond
what
I
should
have
dared
to
hope
for
.
<EOS>
And
few
women
can
have
been
chosen
more
entirely
for
their
own
sake
.
<EOS>
You
should
feel
yourself
a
happy
mother
.

There
was
a
railway
journey
of
some
fifty
miles
before
the
new
husband
and
wife
reached
the
station
near
Ryelands
.
<EOS>
The
sky
had
veiled
itself
since
the
morning
,
and
it
was
hardly
more
than
twilight
when
they
entered
the
park
-
gates
,
but
<EOS>
still
Gwendolen
,
looking
out
of
the
carriage
-
window
as
they
drove
rapidly
along
,
could
see
the
grand
outlines
and
the
nearer
beauties
of
the
scene
 
<EOS>
the
long
winding
drive
bordered
with
evergreens
backed
by
huge
gray
stems
:
then
the
opening
of
wide
grassy
spaces
and
undulations
studded
with
dark
clumps
;
till
at
last
came
a
wide
level
where
the
white
house
could
be
seen
,
with
a
hanging
wood
for
a
back
-
ground
,
and
the
rising
and
sinking
balustrade
of
a
terrace
in
front
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
had
been
at
her
liveliest
during
the
journey
,
chatting
incessantly
,
ignoring
any
change
in
their
mutual
position
since
yesterday
;
and
Grandcourt
had
been
rather
ecstatically
quiescent
,
while
she
turned
his
gentle
seizure
of
her
hand
into
a
grasp
of
his
hand
by
both
hers
,
with
an
increased
vivacity
as
of
a
kitten
that
will
not
sit
quiet
to
be
petted
.
<EOS>
She
was
really
getting
somewhat
febrile
in
her
excitement
;
and
now
in
this
drive
through
the
park
her
usual
susceptibility
to
changes
of
light
and
scenery
helped
to
make
her
heart
palpitate
newly
.
<EOS>
Was
it
at
the
novelty
simply
,
or
the
almost
incredible
fulfilment
about
to
be
given
to
her
girlish
dreams
of
being
"
<EOS>
somebody
"
 
walking
through
her
own
furlong
of
corridor
and
under
her
own
ceilings
of
an
out
-
of
-
sight
loftiness
,
where
her
own
painted
Spring
was
shedding
painted
flowers
,
and
her
own
fore
-
shortened
Zephyrs
were
blowing
their
trumpets
over
her
;
while
her
own
servants
,
lackeys
in
clothing
but
men
in
bulk
and
shape
,
were
as
nought
in
her
presence
,
and
revered
the
propriety
of
her
insolence
to
them
:
 
being
in
short
the
heroine
of
an
admired
play
without
the
pains
of
art
?
<EOS>
Was
it
alone
the
closeness
of
this
fulfilment
which
made
her
heart
flutter
?
<EOS>
or
was
it
some
dim
forecast
,
the
insistent
penetration
of
suppressed
experience
,
mixing
the
expectation
of
a
triumph
with
the
dread
of
a
crisis
?
<EOS>
Hers
was
one
of
the
natures
in
which
exultation
inevitably
carries
an
infusion
of
dread
ready
to
curdle
and
declare
itself
.
  
<EOS>
She
fell
silent
in
spite
of
herself
as
they
approached
the
gates
,
and
when
her
husband
said
,
"
Here
we
are
at
home
!
"
<EOS>
and
for
the
first
time
kissed
her
on
the
lips
,
she
hardly
knew
of
it
:
it
was
no
more
than
the
passive
acceptance
of
a
greeting
in
the
midst
of
an
absorbing
show
.
<EOS>
Was
not
all
her
hurrying
life
of
the
last
three
months
a
show
,
in
which
her
consciousness
was
a
wondering
spectator
?
<EOS>
After
the
half
-
willful
excitement
of
the
day
,
a
numbness
had
come
over
her
personality
.
  
<EOS>
But
there
was
a
brilliant
light
in
the
hall
 
<EOS>
warmth
,
matting
,
carpets
,
full
-
length
portraits
,
Olympian
statues
,
assiduous
servants
.
<EOS>
Not
many
servants
,
however
:
only
a
few
from
Diplow
in
addition
to
those
constantly
in
charge
of
the
house
;
and
Gwendolen
's
new
maid
,
who
had
come
with
her
,
was
taken
under
guidance
by
the
housekeeper
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
felt
herself
being
led
by
Grandcourt
along
a
subtly
-
scented
corridor
,
into
an
ante
-
room
where
she
saw
an
open
doorway
sending
out
a
rich
glow
of
light
and
color
.
  
<EOS>
"
These
are
our
dens
,
"
said
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
like
to
be
quiet
here
till
dinner
.
<EOS>
We
shall
dine
early
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
pressed
her
hand
to
his
lips
and
moved
away
,
more
in
love
than
he
had
ever
expected
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
yielded
up
her
hat
and
mantle
,
threw
herself
into
a
chair
by
the
glowing
hearth
,
and
saw
herself
repeated
in
glass
panels
with
all
her
faint
-
green
satin
surroundings
.
<EOS>
The
housekeeper
had
passed
into
this
boudoir
from
the
adjoining
dressing
-
room
and
seemed
disposed
to
linger
,
Gwendolen
thought
,
in
order
to
look
at
the
new
mistress
of
Ryelands
,
who
,
however
,
being
impatient
for
solitude
said
to
her
,
"
Will
you
tell
Hudson
when
she
has
put
out
my
dress
to
leave
everything
?
<EOS>
I
shall
not
want
her
again
,
unless
I
ring
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
housekeeper
,
coming
forward
,
said
,
"
Here
is
a
packet
,
madam
,
which
I
was
ordered
to
give
into
nobody
's
hands
but
<EOS>
yours
,
when
you
were
alone
.
<EOS>
The
person
who
brought
it
said
it
was
a
present
particularly
ordered
by
Mr.
Grandcourt
;
but
he
was
not
to
know
of
its
arrival
till
he
saw
you
wear
it
.
<EOS>
Excuse
me
,
madam
<EOS>
;
I
felt
it
right
to
obey
orders
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
took
the
packet
and
let
it
lie
on
her
lap
till
she
heard
the
doors
close
.
<EOS>
It
came
into
her
mind
that
the
packet
might
contain
the
diamonds
which
Grandcourt
had
spoken
of
as
being
deposited
somewhere
and
to
be
given
to
her
on
her
marriage
.
<EOS>
In
this
moment
of
confused
feeling
and
creeping
luxurious
languor
she
was
glad
of
this
diversion
 
glad
of
such
an
event
as
having
her
own
diamonds
to
try
on
.
  
<EOS>
Within
all
the
sealed
paper
coverings
was
a
box
,
but
within
the
box
there
_
was
_
a
jewel
-
case
;
and
now
she
felt
no
doubt
that
she
had
the
diamonds
.
<EOS>
But
on
opening
the
case
,
in
the
same
instant
that
she
saw
them
gleam
she
saw
a
letter
lying
above
them
.
<EOS>
She
knew
the
handwriting
of
the
address
.
<EOS>
It
was
as
if
an
adder
had
lain
on
them
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
gave
a
leap
which
seemed
to
have
spent
all
her
strength
;
and
as
she
opened
the
bit
of
thin
paper
,
it
shook
with
the
trembling
of
her
hands
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
legible
as
print
,
and
thrust
its
words
upon
her
.
      
<EOS>
These
diamonds
,
which
were
once
given
with
ardent
love
to
Lydia
    
Glasher
<EOS>
,
she
passes
on
to
you
.
<EOS>
You
have
broken
your
word
to
her
,
that
    
you
might
possess
what
was
hers
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
think
of
being
happy
,
as
    
she
once
was
,
and
of
having
beautiful
children
such
as
hers
,
who
will
    
thrust
hers
aside
.
<EOS>
God
is
too
just
for
that
.
<EOS>
The
man
you
have
married
    
has
a
withered
heart
.
<EOS>
His
best
young
love
was
mine
:
you
could
not
take
    
that
from
me
when
you
took
the
rest
.
<EOS>
It
is
dead
:
but
I
am
the
grave
    
in
which
your
chance
of
happiness
is
buried
as
well
as
mine
.
<EOS>
You
had
    
your
warning
.
<EOS>
You
have
chosen
to
injure
me
and
my
children
.
<EOS>
He
had
    
meant
to
marry
me
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
married
me
at
last
,
if
you
had
not
    
broken
your
word
.
<EOS>
You
will
have
your
punishment
.
<EOS>
I
desire
it
with
all
    
my
soul
.
      
<EOS>
Will
you
give
him
this
letter
to
set
him
against
me
and
ruin
us
    
more
 
me
and
my
children
?
<EOS>
Shall
you
like
to
stand
before
your
husband
    
with
these
diamonds
on
you
,
and
these
words
of
mine
in
his
thoughts
and
    
yours
?
<EOS>
Will
he
think
you
have
any
right
to
complain
when
he
has
made
    
you
miserable
?
<EOS>
You
took
him
with
your
eyes
open
.
<EOS>
The
willing
wrong
you
    
have
done
me
will
be
your
curse
.
  
<EOS>
It
seemed
at
first
as
if
Gwendolen
's
eyes
were
spell
-
bound
in
reading
the
horrible
words
of
the
letter
over
and
over
again
as
a
doom
of
penance
;
but
suddenly
a
new
spasm
of
terror
made
her
lean
forward
and
stretch
out
the
paper
toward
the
fire
,
<EOS>
lest
accusation
and
proof
at
once
should
meet
all
eyes
.
<EOS>
It
flew
like
a
feather
from
her
trembling
fingers
and
was
caught
up
in
a
great
draught
of
flame
.
<EOS>
In
her
movement
the
casket
fell
on
the
floor
and
the
diamonds
rolled
out
.
<EOS>
She
took
no
notice
,
but
fell
back
in
her
chair
again
helpless
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
see
the
reflections
of
herself
then
;
they
were
like
so
many
women
petrified
white
;
but
coming
near
herself
you
might
have
seen
the
tremor
in
her
lips
and
hands
.
<EOS>
She
sat
so
for
a
long
while
,
knowing
little
more
than
that
she
was
feeling
ill
,
and
that
those
written
words
kept
repeating
themselves
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
Truly
here
were
poisoned
gems
,
and
the
poison
had
entered
into
this
poor
young
creature
.
  
<EOS>
After
that
long
while
,
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
and
Grandcourt
entered
,
dressed
for
dinner
.
<EOS>
The
sight
of
him
brought
a
new
nervous
shock
,
and
Gwendolen
screamed
again
and
again
with
hysterical
violence
.
<EOS>
He
had
expected
to
see
her
dressed
and
smiling
,
ready
to
be
led
down
.
<EOS>
He
saw
her
pallid
,
shrieking
as
it
seemed
with
terror
,
the
jewels
scattered
around
her
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
Was
it
a
fit
of
madness
?
  
<EOS>
In
some
form
or
other
the
furies
had
crossed
his
threshold
.
        
<EOS>
In
all
ages
it
hath
been
a
favorite
text
that
a
potent
love
hath
the
    
nature
of
an
isolated
fatality
,
whereto
the
mind
's
opinions
and
wonted
    
resolves
are
altogether
alien
;
as
,
for
example
,
Daphnis
his
frenzy
,
    
wherein
it
had
little
availed
him
to
have
been
convinced
of
Heraclitus
    
his
doctrine
;
or
the
philtre
-
bred
passion
of
Tristan
,
who
,
though
he
    
had
been
as
deep
as
Duns
Scotus
,
would
have
had
his
reasoning
marred
    
by
that
cup
too
much
;
or
Romeo
in
his
sudden
taking
for
Juliet
,
    
wherein
any
objections
he
might
have
held
against
Ptolemy
had
made
    
little
difference
to
his
discourse
under
the
balcony
.
<EOS>
Yet
all
love
is
    
not
such
,
even
though
potent
;
nay
,
this
passion
hath
as
large
scope
as
    
any
for
allying
itself
with
every
operation
of
the
soul
:
so
that
it
    
shall
acknowledge
an
effect
from
the
imagined
light
of
unproven
    
firmaments
,
and
have
its
scale
set
to
the
grander
orbits
of
what
hath
    
been
and
shall
be
.
   
<EOS>
Deronda
,
on
his
return
to
town
,
could
assure
Sir
Hugo
of
his
having
lodged
in
Grandcourt
's
mind
a
distinct
understanding
that
he
could
get
fifty
thousand
pounds
by
giving
up
a
prospect
which
was
probably
distant
,
and
not
absolutely
certain
;
but
he
had
no
further
sign
of
Grandcourt
's
disposition
in
the
matter
than
that
he
was
evidently
inclined
to
keep
up
friendly
communications
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
did
you
think
of
the
future
bride
on
a
nearer
survey
?
"
said
Sir
Hugo
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
better
of
her
than
I
did
in
Leubronn
.
<EOS>
Roulette
was
not
a
good
setting
for
her
;
it
brought
out
something
of
the
demon
.
<EOS>
At
Diplow
she
seemed
much
more
womanly
and
attractive
 
less
hard
and
self
-
possessed
.
<EOS>
I
thought
her
mouth
and
eyes
had
quite
a
different
expression
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
flirt
with
her
too
much
,
Dan
,
"
said
Sir
Hugo
,
meaning
to
be
agreeably
playful
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
make
Grandcourt
savage
when
they
come
to
the
Abbey
at
Christmas
,
it
will
interfere
with
my
affairs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
stay
in
town
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
.
<EOS>
Lady
Mallinger
and
the
children
ca
n't
do
without
you
at
Christmas
.
<EOS>
Only
do
n't
make
mischief
 
unless
you
can
get
up
a
duel
,
and
manage
to
shoot
Grandcourt
,
which
might
be
worth
a
little
inconvenience
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
you
ever
saw
me
flirt
,
"
said
Deronda
,
not
amused
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
have
n't
I
,
though
?
"
said
Sir
Hugo
,
provokingly
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
always
looking
tenderly
at
the
women
,
and
talking
to
them
in
a
Jesuitical
way
.
<EOS>
You
are
a
dangerous
young
fellow
 
a
kind
of
Lovelace
who
will
make
the
Clarissas
run
after
you
instead
of
you
running
after
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
What
was
the
use
of
being
exasperated
at
a
tasteless
joke
?
 
<EOS>
only
the
exasperation
comes
before
the
reflection
on
utility
.
<EOS>
Few
friendly
remarks
are
more
annoying
than
the
information
that
we
are
always
seeming
to
do
what
we
never
mean
to
do
.
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
's
notion
of
flirting
,
it
was
to
be
hoped
,
was
rather
peculiar
;
for
his
own
part
,
Deronda
was
sure
that
he
had
never
flirted
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
glad
that
the
baronet
had
no
knowledge
about
the
repurchase
of
Gwendolen
's
necklace
to
feed
his
taste
for
this
kind
of
rallying
.
  
<EOS>
He
would
be
on
his
guard
in
future
;
for
example
,
in
his
behavior
at
Mrs.
Meyrick
's
,
where
he
was
about
to
pay
his
first
visit
since
his
arrival
from
Leubronn
.
<EOS>
For
Mirah
was
certainly
a
creature
in
whom
it
was
difficult
not
to
show
a
tender
kind
of
interest
both
by
looks
and
speech
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Meyrick
had
not
failed
to
send
Deronda
a
report
of
Mirah
's
well
-
being
in
her
family
.
<EOS>
"
We
are
getting
fonder
of
her
every
day
,
"
she
had
written
.
"
<EOS>
At
breakfast
-
time
we
all
look
toward
the
door
with
expectation
to
see
her
come
in
;
and
we
watch
her
and
listen
to
her
as
if
she
were
a
native
from
a
new
country
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
heard
a
word
from
her
lips
that
gives
me
a
doubt
about
her
.
<EOS>
She
is
quite
contented
and
full
of
gratitude
.
<EOS>
My
daughters
are
learning
from
her
,
and
they
hope
to
get
her
other
pupils
;
for
she
is
anxious
not
to
eat
the
bread
of
idleness
,
but
to
work
,
like
my
girls
.
<EOS>
Mab
says
our
life
has
become
like
a
fairy
tale
,
and
all
she
is
afraid
of
is
that
Mirah
will
turn
into
a
nightingale
again
and
fly
away
from
us
.
<EOS>
Her
voice
is
just
perfect
:
not
loud
and
strong
,
but
searching
and
melting
,
like
the
thoughts
of
what
has
been
.
<EOS>
That
is
the
way
old
people
like
me
feel
a
beautiful
voice
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Meyrick
did
not
enter
into
particulars
which
would
have
required
her
to
say
that
Amy
and
Mab
,
who
had
accompanied
Mirah
to
the
synagogue
,
found
the
Jewish
faith
less
reconcilable
with
their
wishes
in
her
case
than
in
that
of
Scott
's
Rebecca
.
<EOS>
They
kept
silence
out
of
delicacy
to
Mirah
,
with
whom
her
religion
was
too
tender
<EOS>
a
subject
to
be
touched
lightly
;
but
after
a
while
Amy
,
who
was
much
of
a
practical
reformer
,
could
not
restrain
a
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
Excuse
me
,
Mirah
,
but
<EOS>
_
does
_
<EOS>
it
seem
quite
right
to
you
that
the
women
should
sit
behind
rails
in
a
gallery
apart
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
never
thought
of
anything
else
,
"
said
Mirah
,
with
mild
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
like
better
to
see
the
men
with
their
hats
on
?
"
said
Mab
,
cautiously
proposing
the
smallest
item
of
difference
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes
.
<EOS>
I
like
what
I
have
always
seen
there
,
because
it
brings
back
to
me
the
same
feelings
 
<EOS>
the
feelings
I
would
not
part
with
for
anything
else
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
After
this
,
any
criticism
,
whether
of
doctrine
or
practice
,
would
have
seemed
to
these
generous
little
people
an
inhospitable
cruelty
.
<EOS>
Mirah
's
religion
was
of
one
fibre
with
her
affections
,
and
had
never
presented
itself
to
her
as
a
set
of
propositions
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
says
herself
she
is
a
very
bad
Jewess
,
and
does
not
half
know
her
people
's
religion
,
"
said
Amy
,
when
Mirah
was
gone
to
bed
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
it
would
gradually
melt
away
from
her
,
and
she
would
pass
into
Christianity
like
the
rest
of
the
world
,
if
she
got
to
love
us
very
much
,
and
never
found
her
mother
.
<EOS>
It
is
so
strange
to
be
of
the
Jews
'
religion
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
oh
,
oh
!
"
cried
Mab
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
were
not
such
a
hideous
Christian
.
<EOS>
How
can
an
ugly
Christian
,
who
is
always
dropping
her
work
,
convert
a
beautiful
Jewess
,
who
has
not
a
fault
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
wicked
of
me
,
"
said
shrewd
Kate
,
"
but
I
can
not
help
wishing
that
her
mother
may
not
be
found
.
<EOS>
There
might
be
something
unpleasant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
it
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
Mirah
is
cut
out
after
the
pattern
of
her
mother
.
<EOS>
And
what
a
joy
it
would
be
to
her
to
have
such
a
daughter
brought
back
again
!
<EOS>
But
a
mother
's
feelings
are
not
worth
reckoning
,
I
suppose
"
(
she
shot
a
mischievous
glance
at
her
own
daughters
)
,
"
and
a
dead
mother
is
worth
more
<EOS>
that
a
living
one
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
,
and
so
she
may
be
,
little
mother
,
"
said
Kate
;
"
but
we
would
rather
hold
you
cheaper
,
and
have
you
alive
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Not
only
the
Meyricks
,
whose
various
knowledge
had
been
acquired
by
the
irregular
foraging
to
which
clever
girls
have
usually
been
reduced
,
but
Deronda
himself
,
with
all
his
masculine
instruction
,
had
been
roused
by
this
apparition
of
Mirah
to
the
consciousness
of
knowing
hardly
anything
about
modern
Judaism
or
the
inner
Jewish
history
.
<EOS>
The
Chosen
People
have
been
commonly
treated
as
a
people
chosen
for
the
sake
of
somebody
else
;
and
their
thinking
as
something
(
no
matter
exactly
what
)
<EOS>
that
ought
to
have
been
entirely
otherwise
;
and
Deronda
,
like
his
neighbors
,
had
regarded
Judaism
as
a
sort
of
eccentric
fossilized
form
which
an
accomplished
man
might
dispense
with
studying
,
and
leave
to
specialists
.
<EOS>
But
Mirah
,
with
her
terrified
flight
from
one
parent
,
and
her
yearning
after
the
other
,
had
flashed
on
him
the
hitherto
neglected
reality
that
Judaism
was
something
still
throbbing
in
human
lives
,
still
making
for
them
the
only
conceivable
vesture
of
the
world
;
and
in
the
idling
excursion
on
which
he
immediately
afterward
set
out
with
Sir
Hugo
he
began
to
look
for
the
outsides
of
synagogues
,
and
the
title
of
books
about
the
Jews
.
<EOS>
This
awakening
of
a
new
interest
 
<EOS>
this
passing
from
the
supposition
that
we
hold
the
right
opinions
on
a
subject
we
are
careless
about
,
to
a
sudden
care
for
it
,
and
a
sense
that
our
opinions
were
ignorance
 
is
an
effectual
remedy
for
_
ennui
_
,
which
,
unhappily
,
can
not
be
secured
on
a
physician
's
prescription
;
but
Deronda
had
carried
it
with
him
,
and
endured
his
weeks
of
lounging
all
the
better
.
<EOS>
It
was
on
this
journey
that
he
first
entered
a
Jewish
synagogue
 
at
Frankfort
 
where
his
party
rested
on
a
Friday
.
<EOS>
In
exploring
the
Juden
-
gasse
,
which
he
had
seen
long
before
,
he
remembered
well
enough
its
picturesque
old
houses
;
what
his
eyes
chiefly
dwelt
on
now
were
the
human
types
there
;
and
his
thought
,
busily
connecting
them
with
the
past
phases
of
their
race
,
stirred
that
fibre
of
historic
sympathy
which
had
helped
to
determine
in
him
certain
traits
worth
mentioning
for
those
who
are
interested
in
his
future
.
<EOS>
True
,
when
a
young
man
has
a
fine
person
,
no
eccentricity
of
manners
,
the
education
of
a
gentleman
,
and
a
present
income
,
it
is
not
customary
to
feel
a
prying
curiosity
about
his
way
of
thinking
,
or
his
peculiar
tastes
.
<EOS>
He
may
very
well
be
settled
in
life
as
an
agreeable
clever
young
fellow
without
passing
a
special
examination
on
those
heads
.
<EOS>
Later
,
when
he
is
getting
rather
slovenly
and
portly
,
his
peculiarities
are
more
distinctly
discerned
,
and
it
is
taken
as
a
mercy
if
they
are
not
highly
objectionable
.
<EOS>
But
any
one
wishing
to
understand
the
effect
of
after
-
events
on
Deronda
<EOS>
should
know
a
little
more
of
what
he
was
at
five
-
and
-
twenty
than
was
evident
in
ordinary
intercourse
.
  
<EOS>
It
happened
that
the
very
vividness
of
his
impressions
had
often
made
him
the
more
enigmatic
to
his
friends
,
and
had
contributed
to
an
apparent
indefiniteness
in
his
sentiments
.
<EOS>
His
early
-
wakened
sensibility
and
reflectiveness
had
developed
into
a
many
-
sided
sympathy
,
which
threatened
to
hinder
any
persistent
course
of
action
:
as
soon
as
he
took
up
any
antagonism
,
though
only
in
thought
,
he
seemed
to
himself
like
the
Sabine
warriors
in
the
memorable
story
 
with
nothing
to
meet
his
spear
but
flesh
of
his
flesh
,
and
objects
that
he
loved
.
<EOS>
His
imagination
had
so
wrought
itself
to
the
habit
of
seeing
things
as
they
probably
appeared
to
others
,
that
a
strong
partisanship
,
unless
it
were
against
an
immediate
oppression
,
had
become
an
insincerity
for
him
.
<EOS>
His
plenteous
,
flexible
sympathy
had
ended
by
falling
into
one
current
with
that
reflective
analysis
which
tends
to
neutralize
sympathy
.
<EOS>
Few
men
were
able
to
keep
themselves
clearer
of
vices
than
he
;
yet
he
hated
vices
mildly
,
being
used
to
think
of
them
less
in
the
abstract
than
as
a
part
of
mixed
human
natures
having
an
individual
history
,
which
it
was
the
bent
of
his
mind
to
trace
with
understanding
and
pity
.
<EOS>
With
the
same
innate
balance
he
was
fervidly
democratic
in
his
feeling
for
the
multitude
,
and
yet
,
through
his
affections
and
imagination
,
intensely
conservative
;
voracious
of
speculations
on
government
and
religion
,
yet
loth
to
part
with
long
-
sanctioned
forms
which
,
for
him
,
were
quick
with
memories
and
sentiments
that
no
argument
could
lay
dead
.
<EOS>
We
fall
on
the
leaning
side
;
and
Deronda
suspected
himself
of
loving
too
well
the
losing
causes
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
Martyrdom
changes
sides
,
and
he
was
in
danger
of
changing
with
it
,
having
a
strong
repugnance
to
taking
up
that
clue
of
success
which
the
order
of
the
world
often
forces
upon
us
and
makes
it
treason
against
the
common
weal
to
reject
.
<EOS>
And
yet
his
fear
of
falling
into
an
unreasoning
narrow
hatred
made
a
check
for
him
:
he
apologized
for
the
heirs
of
privilege
;
he
shrank
with
dislike
from
the
loser
's
bitterness
and
the
denunciatory
tone
of
the
unaccepted
innovator
.
<EOS>
A
too
reflective
and
diffusive
sympathy
was
in
danger
of
paralyzing
in
him
that
indignation
against
wrong
and
that
selectness
of
fellowship
which
are
the
conditions
of
moral
force
;
and
in
the
last
few
years
of
confirmed
manhood
he
had
become
so
keenly
aware
of
this
that
what
he
most
longed
for
was
either
some
external
event
,
or
some
inward
light
,
that
would
urge
him
into
a
definite
line
of
action
,
and
compress
his
wandering
energy
.
<EOS>
He
was
ceasing
to
care
for
knowledge
 
<EOS>
he
had
no
ambition
for
practice
 
unless
they
could
both
be
gathered
up
into
one
current
with
his
emotions
;
and
he
dreaded
,
as
if
it
were
a
dwelling
-
place
of
lost
souls
,
that
dead
anatomy
of
culture
which
turns
the
universe
into
a
mere
ceaseless
answer
to
queries
,
and
knows
,
not
everything
,
but
everything
else
about
everything
 
as
if
one
should
be
ignorant
of
nothing
concerning
the
scent
of
violets
except
the
scent
itself
for
which
one
had
no
nostril
.
<EOS>
But
how
and
whence
was
the
needed
event
to
come
?
 
<EOS>
the
influence
that
would
justify
partiality
,
and
make
him
what
he
longed
to
be
,
yet
was
unable
to
make
himself
 
an
organic
part
of
social
life
,
instead
of
roaming
in
it
like
a
yearning
disembodied
spirit
,
stirred
with
a
vague
social
passion
,
but
without
fixed
local
habitation
to
render
fellowship
real
?
<EOS>
To
make
a
little
difference
for
the
better
was
what
he
was
not
contented
to
live
without
;
but
how
to
make
it
?
<EOS>
It
is
one
thing
to
see
your
road
,
another
to
cut
it
.
<EOS>
He
found
some
of
the
fault
in
his
birth
and
the
way
he
had
been
brought
up
,
which
had
laid
no
special
demands
on
him
and
had
given
him
no
fixed
relationship
except
one
of
a
doubtful
kind
;
but
he
did
not
attempt
to
hide
from
himself
that
he
had
fallen
into
a
meditative
numbness
,
and
was
gliding
farther
and
farther
from
that
life
of
practically
energetic
sentiment
which
he
would
have
proclaimed
(
if
he
had
been
inclined
to
proclaim
anything
)
to
be
the
best
of
all
life
,
and
for
himself
the
only
way
worth
living
.
<EOS>
He
wanted
some
way
of
keeping
emotion
and
its
progeny
of
sentiments
 
which
make
the
savors
of
life
 
substantial
and
strong
in
the
face
of
a
reflectiveness
that
threatened
to
nullify
all
differences
.
<EOS>
To
pound
the
objects
of
sentiment
into
small
dust
,
yet
keep
sentiment
alive
and
active
,
was
something
like
the
famous
recipe
for
making
cannon
 
to
first
take
a
round
hole
and
then
enclose
it
with
iron
;
whatever
you
do
keeping
fast
hold
of
your
round
hole
.
<EOS>
Yet
how
distinguish
what
our
will
may
wisely
save
in
its
completeness
,
from
the
heaping
of
cat
-
mummies
and
the
expensive
cult
of
enshrined
putrefactions
?
  
<EOS>
Something
like
this
was
the
common
under
-
current
in
Deronda
's
mind
while
he
was
reading
law
or
imperfectly
attending
to
polite
conversation
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
he
had
not
set
about
one
function
in
particular
with
zeal
and
steadiness
.
<EOS>
Not
an
admirable
experience
,
to
be
proposed
as
an
ideal
;
but
a
form
of
struggle
before
break
of
day
which
some
young
men
since
the
patriarch
have
had
to
pass
through
,
with
more
or
less
of
bruising
if
not
laming
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
said
that
under
his
calm
exterior
he
had
a
fervor
which
made
him
easily
feel
the
presence
of
poetry
in
everyday
events
;
and
the
forms
of
the
Juden
-
gasse
,
rousing
the
sense
of
union
with
what
is
remote
,
set
him
musing
on
two
elements
of
our
historic
life
which
that
sense
raises
into
the
same
region
of
poetry
;
 
the
faint
beginnings
of
faiths
and
institutions
,
and
their
obscure
lingering
decay
;
the
dust
and
withered
remnants
with
which
they
are
apt
to
be
covered
,
only
enhancing
for
the
awakened
perception
the
impressiveness
either
of
a
sublimely
penetrating
life
,
as
in
the
twin
green
leaves
that
will
become
the
sheltering
tree
,
or
of
a
pathetic
inheritance
in
which
all
the
grandeur
and
the
glory
have
become
a
sorrowing
memory
.
  
<EOS>
This
imaginative
stirring
,
as
he
turned
out
of
the
Juden
-
gasse
,
and
continued
to
saunter
in
the
warm
evening
air
,
meaning
to
find
his
way
to
the
synagogue
,
neutralized
the
repellent
effect
of
certain
ugly
little
incidents
on
his
way
.
<EOS>
Turning
into
an
old
book
-
shop
to
ask
the
exact
time
of
service
at
the
synagogue
,
he
was
affectionately
directed
by
a
precocious
Jewish
youth
,
who
entered
cordially
into
his
wanting
,
not
the
fine
new
building
of
the
Reformed
but
the
old
Rabbinical
school
of
the
orthodox
;
and
then
cheated
him
like
a
pure
Teuton
,
only
with
more
amenity
,
in
his
charge
for
a
book
quite
out
of
request
as
one
"
nicht
<EOS>
so
leicht
zu
bekommen
.
<EOS>
"
Meanwhile
at
the
opposite
counter
a
deaf
and
grisly
tradesman
was
casting
a
flinty
look
at
certain
cards
,
apparently
combining
advantages
of
business
with
religion
,
and
shoutingly
proposed
to
him
in
Jew
-
dialect
by
a
dingy
man
in
a
tall
coat
hanging
from
neck
to
heel
,
a
bag
in
hand
,
and
a
broad
low
hat
surmounting
his
chosen
nose
 
who
had
no
sooner
disappeared
than
another
dingy
man
of
the
same
pattern
issued
from
the
background
glooms
of
the
shop
and
also
shouted
in
the
same
dialect
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
Deronda
saw
various
queer
-
looking
Israelites
not
altogether
without
guile
,
and
just
distinguishable
from
queer
-
looking
Christians
of
the
same
mixed
_
morale
_
.
<EOS>
In
his
anxiety
about
Mirah
's
relatives
,
he
had
lately
been
thinking
of
vulgar
Jews
with
a
sort
of
personal
alarm
.
<EOS>
But
a
little
comparison
will
often
diminish
our
surprise
and
disgust
at
the
aberrations
of
Jews
and
other
dissidents
whose
lives
do
not
offer
a
consistent
or
lovely
pattern
of
their
creed
;
and
<EOS>
this
evening
Deronda
,
becoming
more
conscious
that
he
was
falling
into
unfairness
and
ridiculous
exaggeration
,
began
to
use
that
corrective
comparison
:
he
paid
his
thaler
too
much
,
without
prejudice
to
his
interests
in
the
Hebrew
destiny
,
or
his
wish
to
find
the
_
Rabbinische
Schule
_
,
which
he
arrived
at
by
sunset
,
and
entered
with
a
good
congregation
of
men
.
  
<EOS>
He
happened
to
take
his
seat
in
a
line
with
an
elderly
man
from
whom
he
was
distant
enough
to
glance
at
him
more
than
once
as
rather
a
noticeable
figure
 
<EOS>
his
ample
white
beard
and
felt
hat
framing
a
profile
of
that
fine
contour
which
may
as
easily
be
Italian
as
Hebrew
.
<EOS>
He
returned
Deronda
's
notice
till
at
last
their
eyes
met
;
an
undesirable
chance
with
unknown
persons
,
and
a
reason
to
Deronda
for
not
looking
again
;
but
he
immediately
found
an
open
prayer
-
book
pushed
toward
him
and
had
to
bow
his
thanks
.
<EOS>
However
,
the
congregation
had
mustered
,
the
reader
had
mounted
to
the
_
almemor
_
or
platform
,
and
the
service
began
.
<EOS>
Deronda
,
having
looked
enough
at
the
German
translation
of
the
Hebrew
in
the
book
before
him
to
know
that
he
was
chiefly
hearing
Psalms
and
Old
Testament
passages
or
phrases
,
gave
himself
up
to
that
strongest
effect
of
chanted
liturgies
which
is
independent
of
detailed
verbal
meaning
 
like
the
effect
of
an
Allegri
's
_
Miserere
_
or
a
Palestrina
's
_
Magnificat
_
.
<EOS>
The
most
powerful
movement
of
feeling
with
a
liturgy
is
the
prayer
which
seeks
for
nothing
special
,
but
is
a
yearning
to
escape
from
the
limitations
of
our
own
weakness
and
an
invocation
of
all
Good
to
enter
and
abide
with
us
;
or
else
a
self
-
oblivious
lifting
up
of
Gladness
,
a
_
Gloria
in
excelsis
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
that
such
Good
exists
;
both
the
yearning
and
the
exaltation
gathering
their
utmost
force
from
the
sense
of
communion
in
a
form
which
has
expressed
them
both
,
for
long
generations
of
struggling
fellow
-
men
.
<EOS>
The
Hebrew
liturgy
,
like
others
,
has
its
transitions
of
litany
,
lyric
,
proclamation
,
dry
statement
and
blessing
;
but
this
evening
,
all
were
one
for
Deronda
:
the
chant
of
the
_
Chazaris
_
or
Reader
's
grand
wide
-
ranging
voice
with
its
passage
from
monotony
to
sudden
cries
,
the
outburst
of
sweet
boys
'
voices
from
the
little
choir
,
the
devotional
swaying
of
men
's
bodies
backward
and
forward
,
the
very
commonness
of
the
building
and
shabbiness
of
the
scene
where
a
national
faith
,
which
had
penetrated
the
thinking
of
half
the
world
,
and
moulded
the
splendid
forms
of
that
world
's
religion
,
was
finding
a
remote
,
obscure
echo
 
all
were
blent
for
him
as
one
expression
of
a
binding
history
,
tragic
and
yet
glorious
.
<EOS>
He
wondered
at
the
strength
of
his
own
feeling
;
it
seemed
beyond
the
occasion
 
what
one
might
imagine
to
be
a
divine
influx
in
the
darkness
,
before
there
was
any
vision
to
interpret
.
<EOS>
The
whole
scene
was
a
coherent
strain
,
its
burden
a
passionate
regret
,
which
,
if
he
had
known
the
liturgy
for
the
Day
of
Reconciliation
,
he
might
have
clad
in
its
authentic
burden
;
"
Happy
the
eye
which
saw
all
these
things
;
but
verily
to
hear
only
of
them
afflicts
our
soul
.
<EOS>
Happy
the
eye
that
saw
our
temple
and
the
joy
of
our
congregation
;
but
verily
to
hear
only
of
them
afflicts
our
soul
.
<EOS>
Happy
the
eye
that
saw
the
fingers
when
tuning
every
kind
of
song
;
but
verily
to
hear
only
of
them
afflicts
our
soul
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
with
the
cessation
of
the
devotional
sounds
and
the
movement
of
many
indifferent
faces
and
vulgar
figures
before
him
there
darted
into
his
mind
the
frigid
idea
that
he
had
probably
been
alone
in
his
feeling
,
and
perhaps
the
only
person
in
the
congregation
for
whom
the
service
was
more
than
a
dull
routine
.
<EOS>
There
was
just
time
for
this
chilling
thought
<EOS>
before
he
had
bowed
to
his
civil
neighbor
and
was
moving
away
with
the
rest
 
when
he
felt
a
hand
on
his
arm
,
and
turning
with
the
rather
unpleasant
sensation
which
this
abrupt
sort
of
claim
is
apt
to
bring
,
he
saw
close
to
him
the
white
-
bearded
face
of
that
neighbor
,
who
said
to
him
in
German
,
"
Excuse
me
<EOS>
,
young
gentleman
 
allow
me
 
<EOS>
what
is
your
parentage
 
<EOS>
your
mother
's
family
 
her
maiden
name
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
had
a
strongly
resistant
feeling
:
he
was
inclined
to
shake
off
hastily
the
touch
on
his
arm
;
but
he
managed
to
slip
it
away
and
said
coldly
,
"
I
am
an
Englishman
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
questioner
looked
at
him
dubiously
still
for
an
instant
,
then
just
lifted
his
hat
and
turned
away
;
whether
under
a
sense
of
having
made
a
mistake
or
of
having
been
repulsed
,
Deronda
was
uncertain
.
<EOS>
In
his
walk
back
to
the
hotel
he
tried
to
still
any
uneasiness
on
the
subject
by
reflecting
that
he
could
not
have
acted
differently
.
<EOS>
How
could
he
say
that
he
did
not
know
the
name
of
his
mother
's
family
to
that
total
stranger
?
 
<EOS>
who
indeed
had
taken
an
unwarrantable
liberty
in
the
abruptness
of
his
question
,
dictated
probably
by
some
fancy
of
likeness
such
as
often
occurs
without
real
significance
.
<EOS>
The
incident
,
he
said
to
himself
,
was
trivial
;
but
whatever
import
it
might
have
,
his
inward
shrinking
on
the
occasion
was
too
strong
for
him
to
be
sorry
that
he
had
cut
it
short
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
reason
,
however
,
for
his
not
mentioning
the
synagogue
to
the
Mallingers
 
in
addition
to
his
usual
inclination
to
reticence
on
anything
that
the
baronet
would
have
been
likely
to
call
Quixotic
enthusiasm
.
<EOS>
Hardly
any
man
could
be
more
good
-
natured
than
Sir
Hugo
;
indeed
in
his
kindliness
especially
to
women
,
he
did
actions
which
others
would
have
called
romantic
;
but
he
never
took
a
romantic
view
of
them
,
and
in
general
smiled
at
the
introduction
of
motives
on
a
grand
scale
,
or
of
reasons
that
lay
very
far
off
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
point
of
strongest
difference
between
him
and
Deronda
,
who
rarely
ate
at
breakfast
without
some
silent
discursive
flight
after
grounds
for
filling
up
his
day
according
to
the
practice
of
his
contemporaries
.
  
<EOS>
This
halt
at
Frankfort
was
taken
on
their
way
home
,
and
its
impressions
were
kept
the
more
actively
vibrating
in
him
by
the
duty
of
caring
for
Mirah
's
welfare
.
<EOS>
That
question
about
his
parentage
,
which
if
he
had
not
both
inwardly
and
outwardly
shaken
it
off
as
trivial
,
would
have
seemed
a
threat
rather
than
a
promise
of
revelation
,
and
reinforced
his
anxiety
as
to
the
effect
of
finding
Mirah
's
relatives
and
his
resolve
to
proceed
with
caution
.
<EOS>
If
he
made
any
unpleasant
discovery
,
was
he
bound
to
a
disclosure
that
might
cast
a
new
net
of
trouble
around
her
?
<EOS>
He
had
written
to
Mrs.
Meyrick
to
announce
his
visit
at
four
o'clock
,
and
he
found
Mirah
seated
at
work
with
only
Mrs.
Meyrick
and
Mab
,
the
open
piano
,
and
all
the
glorious
company
of
engravings
.
<EOS>
The
dainty
neatness
of
her
hair
and
dress
,
the
glow
of
tranquil
happiness
in
a
face
where
a
painter
need
have
changed
nothing
if
he
had
wanted
to
put
it
in
front
of
the
host
singing
"
peace
on
earth
and
good
will
to
men
,
"
made
a
contrast
to
his
first
vision
of
her
that
was
delightful
to
Deronda
's
eyes
.
<EOS>
Mirah
herself
was
thinking
of
it
,
and
immediately
on
their
greeting
said
    
"
See
how
different
I
am
from
the
miserable
creature
by
the
river
!
<EOS>
all
because
you
found
me
and
brought
me
to
the
very
best
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
my
good
chance
to
find
you
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
Any
other
man
would
have
been
glad
to
do
what
I
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
not
the
right
way
to
be
thinking
about
it
,
"
said
Mirah
,
shaking
her
head
with
decisive
gravity
,
"
I
think
of
what
really
was
.
<EOS>
It
was
you
,
and
not
another
,
who
found
me
and
were
good
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
agree
with
Mirah
,
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Saint
Anybody
is
a
bad
saint
to
pray
to
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Besides
,
Anybody
could
not
have
brought
me
to
you
,
"
said
Mirah
,
smiling
at
Mrs.
Meyrick
.
<EOS>
"
And
I
would
rather
be
with
you
than
with
any
one
else
in
the
world
except
my
mother
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
if
ever
a
poor
little
bird
,
that
was
lost
and
could
not
fly
,
was
taken
and
put
into
a
warm
nest
where
was
a
mother
and
sisters
who
took
to
it
so
that
everything
came
naturally
,
as
if
it
had
been
always
there
.
<EOS>
I
hardly
thought
before
that
the
world
could
ever
be
as
happy
and
without
fear
as
it
is
to
me
now
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
looked
meditative
a
moment
,
and
then
said
,
"
sometimes
I
am
<EOS>
a
_
little
_
afraid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
you
are
afraid
of
?
"
said
Deronda
with
anxiety
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
when
I
am
turning
at
the
corner
of
a
street
I
may
meet
my
father
.
<EOS>
It
seems
dreadful
that
I
should
be
afraid
of
meeting
him
.
<EOS>
That
is
my
only
sorrow
,
"
said
Mirah
,
plaintively
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
surely
not
very
probable
,
"
said
Deronda
,
wishing
that
it
were
less
so
<EOS>
;
then
,
not
to
let
the
opportunity
escape
 
<EOS>
"
Would
it
be
a
great
grief
to
you
now
if
you
were
never
to
meet
your
mother
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
did
not
answer
immediately
,
but
meditated
again
,
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
opposite
wall
.
<EOS>
Then
she
turned
them
on
Deronda
and
said
firmly
,
as
if
she
had
arrived
at
the
exact
truth
,
"
I
want
her
to
know
that
I
have
always
loved
her
,
and
if
she
is
alive
I
want
to
comfort
her
.
<EOS>
She
may
be
dead
.
<EOS>
If
she
were
<EOS>
I
should
long
to
know
where
she
was
buried
;
and
to
know
whether
my
brother
lives
,
so
that
we
can
remember
her
together
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
try
not
to
grieve
.
<EOS>
I
have
thought
much
for
so
many
years
of
her
being
dead
.
<EOS>
And
I
shall
have
her
with
me
in
my
mind
,
as
I
have
always
had
.
<EOS>
We
can
never
be
really
parted
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
never
sinned
against
her
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
tried
not
to
do
what
would
hurt
her
.
<EOS>
Only
,
she
might
be
sorry
that
I
was
not
a
good
Jewess
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
what
way
are
you
not
a
good
Jewess
?
"
said
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
ignorant
,
and
we
never
observed
the
laws
,
but
lived
among
Christians
just
as
they
did
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
heard
my
father
laugh
at
the
strictness
of
the
Jews
about
their
food
and
all
customs
,
and
their
not
liking
Christians
.
<EOS>
I
think
my
mother
was
strict
;
but
she
could
never
want
me
not
to
like
those
who
are
better
to
me
than
any
of
my
own
people
I
have
ever
known
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
could
obey
in
other
things
that
she
wished
but
not
in
that
.
<EOS>
It
is
so
much
easier
to
me
to
share
in
love
than
in
hatred
.
<EOS>
I
remember
a
play
I
read
in
German
 
since
I
have
been
here
<EOS>
it
has
come
into
my
mind
 
where
the
heroine
says
something
like
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Antigone
,
"
said
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
you
know
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
not
believe
that
my
mother
would
wish
me
not
to
love
my
best
friends
.
<EOS>
She
would
be
grateful
to
them
.
"
<EOS>
Here
Mirah
had
turned
to
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
and
with
a
sudden
lighting
up
of
her
whole
countenance
,
she
said
,
"
Oh
,
if
we
ever
do
meet
and
know
each
other
as
we
are
now
,
so
that
I
could
tell
what
would
comfort
her
 
I
should
be
so
full
of
blessedness
<EOS>
my
soul
would
know
no
want
but
to
love
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
,
child
!
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
the
words
escaping
involuntarily
from
her
motherly
heart
.
<EOS>
But
to
relieve
the
strain
of
feeling
she
looked
at
Deronda
and
said
,
"
It
is
curious
that
Mirah
,
who
remembers
her
mother
<EOS>
so
well
it
is
as
if
she
saw
her
,
can
not
recall
her
brother
the
least
bit
 
except
the
feeling
of
having
been
carried
by
him
when
she
was
tired
,
and
of
his
being
near
her
when
she
was
in
her
mother
's
lap
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
that
he
was
rarely
at
home
.
<EOS>
He
was
already
grown
up
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
pity
her
brother
should
be
quite
a
stranger
to
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
good
;
I
feel
sure
Ezra
is
good
,
"
said
Mirah
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
loved
my
mother
 
he
would
take
care
of
her
.
<EOS>
I
remember
more
of
him
than
that
.
<EOS>
I
remember
my
mother
's
voice
once
calling
,
"
Ezra
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
his
answering
from
a
distance
"
Mother
!
"
<EOS>
"
 
Mirah
had
changed
her
voice
a
little
in
each
of
these
words
and
had
given
them
a
loving
intonation
 
"
and
then
he
came
close
to
us
.
<EOS>
I
feel
sure
he
is
good
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
taken
comfort
from
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
answer
this
either
with
agreement
or
doubt
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Meyrick
and
Deronda
exchanged
a
quick
glance
:
about
this
brother
she
felt
as
painfully
dubious
as
he
did
.
<EOS>
But
Mirah
went
on
,
absorbed
in
her
memories
    
<EOS>
"
Is
it
not
wonderful
how
I
remember
the
voices
better
than
anything
else
?
<EOS>
I
think
they
must
go
deeper
into
us
than
other
things
.
<EOS>
I
have
often
fancied
heaven
might
be
made
of
voices
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Like
your
singing
 
<EOS>
yes
,
"
said
Mab
,
who
had
hitherto
kept
a
modest
silence
,
and
now
spoke
bashfully
,
as
was
her
wo
nt
in
the
presence
of
Prince
Camaralzaman
 
"
Ma
,
do
ask
Mirah
to
sing
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Deronda
has
not
heard
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Would
it
be
disagreeable
to
you
to
sing
now
?
"
said
Deronda
,
with
a
more
deferential
gentleness
than
he
had
ever
been
conscious
of
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
shall
like
it
,
"
said
Mirah
.
<EOS>
"
My
voice
has
come
back
a
little
with
rest
.
"
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
her
ease
of
manner
was
due
to
something
more
than
the
simplicity
of
her
nature
.
<EOS>
The
circumstances
of
her
life
made
her
think
of
everything
she
did
as
work
demanded
from
her
,
in
which
affectation
had
nothing
to
do
;
and
she
had
begun
her
work
before
self
-
consciousness
was
born
.
  
<EOS>
She
immediately
rose
and
went
to
the
piano
 
a
somewhat
worn
instrument
that
seemed
to
get
the
better
of
its
infirmities
under
the
firm
touch
of
her
small
fingers
as
she
preluded
.
<EOS>
Deronda
placed
himself
where
he
could
see
her
while
she
sang
;
and
she
took
everything
as
quietly
as
if
she
had
been
a
child
going
to
breakfast
.
  
<EOS>
Imagine
her
 
it
is
always
good
to
imagine
a
human
creature
in
whom
bodily
loveliness
seems
as
properly
one
with
the
entire
being
as
the
bodily
loveliness
of
those
wondrous
transparent
orbs
of
life
that
we
find
in
the
sea
 
imagine
her
with
her
dark
hair
brushed
from
her
temples
,
but
yet
showing
certain
tiny
rings
there
which
had
cunningly
found
their
own
way
back
,
the
mass
of
it
hanging
behind
just
to
the
nape
of
the
little
neck
in
curly
fibres
,
such
as
renew
themselves
at
their
own
will
after
being
bathed
into
straightness
like
that
of
water
-
grasses
.
<EOS>
Then
see
the
perfect
cameo
her
profile
makes
,
cut
in
a
duskish
shell
,
where
by
some
happy
fortune
there
pierced
a
gem
-
like
darkness
for
the
eye
and
eyebrow
;
the
delicate
nostrils
defined
enough
to
be
ready
for
sensitive
movements
,
the
finished
ear
,
the
firm
curves
of
the
chin
and
neck
,
entering
into
the
expression
of
a
refinement
which
was
not
feebleness
.
  
<EOS>
She
sang
Beethoven
's
"
Per
pietà
non
dirmi
addio
"
with
a
subdued
but
searching
pathos
which
had
that
essential
of
perfect
singing
,
the
making
one
oblivious
of
art
or
manner
,
and
only
possessing
one
with
the
song
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
sort
of
voice
that
gives
the
impression
of
being
meant
like
a
bird
's
wooing
for
an
audience
near
and
beloved
.
<EOS>
Deronda
began
by
looking
at
her
,
but
felt
himself
presently
covering
his
eyes
with
his
hand
,
wanting
to
seclude
the
melody
in
darkness
;
then
he
refrained
from
what
might
seem
oddity
,
and
was
ready
to
meet
the
look
of
mute
appeal
which
she
turned
toward
him
at
the
end
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
never
enjoyed
a
song
more
than
that
,
"
he
said
,
gratefully
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
like
my
singing
?
<EOS>
I
am
so
glad
,
"
she
said
,
with
a
smile
of
delight
.
<EOS>
"
It
has
been
a
great
pain
to
me
,
because
it
failed
in
what
it
was
wanted
for
.
<EOS>
But
now
we
think
I
can
use
it
to
get
my
bread
.
<EOS>
I
have
really
been
taught
well
.
<EOS>
And
now
I
have
two
pupils
,
that
Miss
Meyrick
found
for
me
.
<EOS>
They
pay
me
nearly
two
crowns
for
their
two
lessons
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
know
some
ladies
who
would
find
you
many
pupils
after
Christmas
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
You
would
not
mind
singing
before
any
one
who
wished
to
hear
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
I
want
to
do
something
to
get
money
.
<EOS>
I
could
teach
reading
and
speaking
,
Mrs.
Meyrick
thinks
.
<EOS>
But
if
no
one
would
learn
of
me
,
that
is
difficult
.
"
<EOS>
Mirah
smiled
with
a
touch
of
merriment
he
had
not
seen
in
her
before
.
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
I
should
find
her
poor
 
<EOS>
I
mean
my
mother
.
<EOS>
I
should
want
to
get
money
for
her
.
<EOS>
And
I
can
not
always
live
on
charity
;
though
"
 
here
she
turned
so
as
to
take
all
three
of
her
companions
in
one
glance
 
"
it
is
the
sweetest
charity
in
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
you
can
get
rich
,
"
said
Deronda
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Great
ladies
will
perhaps
like
you
to
teach
their
daughters
,
We
shall
see
.
<EOS>
But
now
do
sing
again
to
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
went
on
willingly
,
singing
with
ready
memory
various
things
by
Gordigiani
and
Schubert
;
then
,
when
she
had
left
the
piano
,
Mab
said
,
entreatingly
,
"
Oh
,
Mirah
,
if
you
would
not
mind
singing
the
little
hymn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
too
childish
,
"
said
Mirah
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
like
lisping
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
hymn
?
"
said
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
Hebrew
hymn
<EOS>
she
remembers
her
mother
singing
over
her
when
she
lay
in
her
cot
,
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
very
much
to
hear
it
,
"
said
Deronda
,
"
if
you
think
I
am
worthy
to
hear
what
is
so
sacred
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
sing
it
if
you
like
,
"
said
Mirah
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
n't
sing
real
words
 
only
here
and
there
a
syllable
like
hers
 
<EOS>
the
rest
is
lisping
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
Hebrew
?
<EOS>
because
if
you
do
,
my
singing
will
seem
childish
nonsense
.
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
shook
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
quite
good
Hebrew
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mirah
crossed
her
little
feet
and
hands
in
her
easiest
attitude
,
and
then
lifted
up
her
head
at
an
angle
which
seemed
to
be
directed
to
some
invisible
face
bent
over
her
,
while
she
sang
a
little
hymn
of
quaint
melancholy
intervals
,
with
syllables
that
really
seemed
childish
lisping
to
her
audience
;
the
voice
in
which
she
gave
it
forth
had
gathered
even
a
sweeter
,
more
cooing
tenderness
than
was
heard
in
her
other
songs
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
were
ever
to
know
the
real
words
,
I
should
still
go
on
in
my
old
way
with
them
,
"
said
Mirah
,
when
she
had
repeated
the
hymn
several
times
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
The
lisped
syllables
are
very
full
of
meaning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
indeed
,
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
mother
hears
something
of
a
lisp
in
her
children
's
talk
to
the
very
last
.
<EOS>
Their
words
are
not
just
what
everybody
else
says
,
though
they
may
be
spelled
the
same
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
to
live
till
my
Hans
got
old
,
I
should
still
see
the
boy
in
him
.
<EOS>
A
mother
's
love
,
I
often
say
,
is
like
a
tree
that
has
got
all
the
wood
in
it
,
from
the
very
first
it
made
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
not
that
the
way
with
friendship
,
too
?
"
said
Deronda
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
not
let
the
mothers
be
too
arrogant
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
little
woman
shook
her
head
over
her
darning
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
easier
to
find
an
old
mother
than
an
old
friend
.
<EOS>
Friendships
begin
with
liking
or
gratitude
 
roots
that
can
be
pulled
up
.
<EOS>
Mother
's
love
begins
deeper
down
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Like
what
you
were
saying
about
the
influence
of
voices
,
"
said
Deronda
,
looking
at
Mirah
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
your
hymn
would
have
had
more
expression
for
me
if
I
had
known
the
words
.
<EOS>
I
went
to
the
synagogue
at
Frankfort
before
I
came
home
,
and
the
service
impressed
me
just
as
much
as
if
I
had
followed
the
words
 
perhaps
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
was
it
great
to
you
?
<EOS>
Did
it
go
to
your
heart
?
"
<EOS>
said
Mirah
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
none
but
our
people
would
feel
that
.
<EOS>
I
thought
it
was
all
shut
away
like
a
river
in
a
deep
valley
,
where
only
heaven
saw
 
I
mean
   
<EOS>
"
she
hesitated
feeling
that
she
could
not
disentangle
her
thought
from
its
imagery
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
But
there
is
not
really
such
a
separation
 
deeper
down
,
as
Mrs.
Meyrick
says
.
<EOS>
Our
religion
is
chiefly
a
Hebrew
religion
;
and
since
Jews
are
men
,
their
religious
feelings
must
have
much
in
common
with
those
of
other
men
 
just
as
their
poetry
,
though
in
one
sense
peculiar
,
has
a
great
deal
in
common
with
the
poetry
of
other
nations
.
<EOS>
Still
it
is
to
be
expected
that
a
Jew
would
feel
the
forms
of
his
people
's
religion
more
than
one
of
another
race
 
and
yet
"
 
here
Deronda
hesitated
in
his
turn
 
"
that
is
perhaps
not
always
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
no
,
"
said
Mirah
,
sadly
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
that
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
them
mock
.
<EOS>
Is
it
not
like
mocking
your
parents
?
 
<EOS>
like
rejoicing
in
your
parents
'
shame
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Some
minds
naturally
rebel
against
whatever
they
were
brought
up
in
,
and
like
the
opposite
;
they
see
the
faults
in
what
is
nearest
to
them
,
"
said
Deronda
apologetically
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
not
like
that
,
"
said
Mirah
,
looking
at
him
with
unconscious
fixedness
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
think
not
,
"
said
Deronda
;
"
<EOS>
but
you
know
I
was
not
brought
up
as
a
Jew
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
I
am
always
forgetting
,
"
said
Mirah
,
with
a
look
of
disappointed
recollection
,
and
slightly
blushing
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
also
felt
rather
embarrassed
,
and
there
was
an
awkward
pause
,
which
he
put
an
end
to
by
saying
playfully
    
"
Whichever
way
we
take
it
,
we
have
to
tolerate
each
other
;
for
if
we
all
went
in
opposition
to
our
teaching
,
we
must
end
in
difference
,
just
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
.
<EOS>
We
should
go
on
forever
in
zig
-
zags
,
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
is
very
weak
-
minded
to
make
your
creed
up
by
the
rule
of
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
Still
one
may
honor
one
's
parents
,
without
following
their
notions
exactly
,
any
more
than
the
exact
cut
of
their
clothing
.
<EOS>
My
father
was
a
Scotch
Calvinist
and
my
mother
was
a
French
Calvinist
;
I
am
neither
quite
Scotch
,
nor
quite
French
,
nor
two
Calvinists
rolled
into
one
,
yet
I
honor
my
parents
'
memory
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
could
not
make
myself
not
a
Jewess
,
"
said
Mirah
,
insistently
,
"
even
if
I
changed
my
belief
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
But
if
Jews
and
Jewesses
went
on
changing
their
religion
,
and
making
no
difference
between
themselves
and
Christians
,
there
would
come
a
time
when
there
would
be
no
Jews
to
be
seen
,
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
taking
that
consummation
very
cheerfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
please
not
to
say
that
,
"
said
Mirah
,
the
tears
gathering
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
first
unkind
thing
you
ever
said
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
begin
that
.
<EOS>
I
will
never
separate
myself
from
my
mother
's
people
.
<EOS>
I
was
forced
to
fly
from
my
father
;
but
if
he
came
back
in
age
and
weakness
and
want
,
and
needed
me
,
should
I
say
,
"
This
is
not
my
father
"
?
<EOS>
If
he
had
shame
,
I
must
share
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
he
who
was
given
to
me
for
my
father
,
and
not
another
.
<EOS>
And
so
it
is
with
my
people
.
<EOS>
I
will
always
be
a
Jewess
.
<EOS>
I
will
love
Christians
when
they
are
good
,
like
you
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
always
cling
to
my
people
.
<EOS>
I
will
always
worship
with
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
Mirah
had
gone
on
speaking
she
had
become
possessed
with
a
sorrowful
passion
 
fervent
,
not
violent
.
<EOS>
Holding
her
little
hands
tightly
clasped
and
looking
at
Mrs.
Meyrick
with
beseeching
,
she
seemed
to
Deronda
a
personification
of
that
spirit
which
impelled
men
after
a
long
inheritance
of
professed
Catholicism
to
leave
wealth
and
high
place
and
risk
their
lives
in
flight
,
that
they
might
join
their
own
people
and
say
,
"
I
am
a
Jew
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mirah
,
Mirah
,
my
dear
child
,
you
mistake
me
!
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
alarmed
.
<EOS>
"
God
forbid
I
should
want
you
to
do
anything
against
your
conscience
.
<EOS>
I
was
only
saying
what
might
be
if
the
world
went
on
.
<EOS>
But
I
had
better
have
left
the
world
alone
,
and
not
wanted
to
be
over
-
wise
.
<EOS>
Forgive
me
,
come
!
<EOS>
we
will
not
try
to
take
you
from
anybody
you
feel
has
more
right
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
do
anything
else
for
you
.
<EOS>
I
owe
you
my
life
,
"
said
Mirah
,
not
yet
quite
calm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
hush
,
now
,
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
punished
enough
for
wagging
my
tongue
foolishly
 
making
an
almanac
for
the
Millennium
,
as
my
husband
used
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
everything
in
the
world
must
come
to
an
end
some
time
.
<EOS>
We
must
bear
to
think
of
that
,
"
said
Mab
,
unable
to
hold
her
peace
on
this
point
.
<EOS>
She
had
already
suffered
from
a
bondage
of
tongue
which
threatened
to
become
severe
if
Mirah
were
to
be
too
much
indulged
in
this
inconvenient
susceptibility
to
innocent
remarks
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
smiled
at
the
irregular
,
blonde
face
,
brought
into
strange
contrast
by
the
side
of
<EOS>
Mirah
's
 
smiled
<EOS>
,
Mab
thought
,
rather
sarcastically
as
he
said
,
"
That
'
prospect
of
everything
coming
to
an
end
will
not
guide
us
far
in
practice
.
<EOS>
Mirah
's
feelings
,
she
tells
us
,
are
concerned
with
what
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mab
was
confused
and
wished
she
had
not
spoken
,
since
Mr.
Deronda
seemed
to
think
that
she
had
found
fault
with
Mirah
;
but
to
have
spoken
once
is
a
tyrannous
reason
for
speaking
again
,
and
<EOS>
she
said
    
"
I
only
meant
that
we
must
have
courage
to
hear
things
,
else
there
is
hardly
anything
we
can
talk
about
.
"
<EOS>
Mab
felt
herself
unanswerable
here
,
inclining
to
the
opinion
of
Socrates
:
"
What
motive
has
a
man
to
live
,
if
not
for
the
pleasure
of
discourse
?
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
took
his
leave
soon
after
,
and
when
Mrs.
Meyrick
went
outside
with
him
to
exchange
a
few
words
about
Mirah
,
he
said
,
"
Hans
is
to
share
my
chambers
when
he
comes
at
Christmas
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
written
to
Rome
about
that
?
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
her
face
lighting
up
.
<EOS>
"
How
very
good
and
thoughtful
of
you
!
<EOS>
You
mentioned
Mirah
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
referred
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
concluded
he
knew
everything
from
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
confess
my
folly
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
yet
written
a
word
about
her
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
been
meaning
to
do
it
,
and
yet
have
ended
my
letter
without
saying
a
word
.
<EOS>
And
I
told
the
girls
to
leave
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
However
!
 
<EOS>
Thank
you
a
thousand
times
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
divined
something
of
what
was
in
the
mother
's
mind
,
and
his
divination
reinforced
a
certain
anxiety
already
present
in
him
.
<EOS>
His
inward
colloquy
was
not
soothing
.
<EOS>
He
said
to
himself
that
no
man
could
see
this
exquisite
creature
without
feeling
it
possible
to
fall
in
love
with
her
;
but
all
the
fervor
of
his
nature
was
engaged
on
the
side
of
precaution
.
<EOS>
There
are
personages
who
feel
themselves
tragic
because
they
march
into
a
palpable
morass
,
dragging
another
with
them
,
and
then
cry
out
against
all
the
gods
.
<EOS>
Deronda
's
mind
was
strongly
set
against
imitating
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
my
hands
on
the
reins
now
,
"
he
thought
,
"
and
I
will
not
drop
them
.
<EOS>
I
shall
go
there
as
little
as
possible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
saw
the
reasons
acting
themselves
out
before
him
.
<EOS>
How
could
he
be
Mirah
's
guardian
and
claim
to
unite
with
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
to
whose
charge
he
had
committed
her
,
if
he
showed
himself
as
a
lover
 
whom
she
did
not
love
 
whom
she
would
not
marry
?
<EOS>
And
if
he
encouraged
any
germ
of
lover
's
feeling
in
himself
it
would
lead
up
to
that
issue
.
<EOS>
Mirah
's
was
not
a
nature
that
would
bear
dividing
against
itself
;
and
even
if
love
won
her
consent
to
marry
a
man
who
was
not
of
her
race
and
religion
,
she
would
never
be
happy
in
acting
against
that
strong
native
bias
which
would
still
reign
in
her
conscience
as
remorse
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
saw
these
consequences
as
we
see
any
danger
of
marring
our
own
work
well
begun
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
delight
to
have
rescued
this
child
acquainted
with
sorrow
,
and
to
think
of
having
placed
her
little
feet
in
protected
paths
.
<EOS>
The
creature
we
help
to
save
,
though
only
a
half
-
reared
linnet
,
bruised
and
lost
by
the
wayside
 
how
we
watch
and
fence
it
,
and
dote
on
its
signs
of
recovery
!
<EOS>
Our
pride
becomes
loving
,
our
self
is
a
not
-
self
for
whose
sake
we
become
virtuous
,
when
we
set
to
some
hidden
work
of
reclaiming
a
life
from
misery
and
look
for
our
triumph
in
the
secret
joy
 
<EOS>
"
This
one
is
the
better
for
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
as
soon
hold
out
my
finger
to
be
bitten
off
as
set
about
spoiling
her
peace
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
one
of
the
rarest
bits
of
fortune
that
I
should
have
had
friends
like
the
Meyricks
to
place
her
with
 
generous
,
delicate
friends
without
any
loftiness
in
their
ways
,
so
that
her
dependence
on
them
is
not
only
safety
but
happiness
.
<EOS>
There
could
be
no
refuge
to
replace
that
,
if
it
were
broken
up
.
<EOS>
But
what
is
the
use
of
my
taking
the
vows
and
settling
everything
as
it
should
be
,
if
<EOS>
that
marplot
Hans
comes
and
upsets
it
all
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Few
things
were
more
likely
.
<EOS>
Hans
was
made
for
mishaps
:
his
very
limbs
seemed
more
breakable
than
other
people
's
 
his
eyes
more
of
a
resort
for
uninvited
flies
and
other
irritating
guests
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
impossible
to
forbid
Hans
's
coming
to
London
.
<EOS>
He
was
intending
to
get
a
studio
there
and
make
it
his
chief
home
;
and
to
propose
that
he
should
defer
coming
on
some
ostensible
ground
,
concealing
the
real
motive
of
winning
time
for
Mirah
's
position
to
become
more
confirmed
and
independent
,
was
impracticable
.
<EOS>
Having
no
other
resource
Deronda
tried
to
believe
that
both
he
and
Mrs.
Meyrick
were
foolishly
troubling
themselves
about
one
of
those
endless
things
called
probabilities
,
which
never
occur
;
but
he
did
not
quite
succeed
in
his
trying
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
found
himself
going
inwardly
through
a
scene
where
on
the
first
discovery
of
Han
's
inclination
he
gave
him
a
very
energetic
warning
 
suddenly
checked
,
however
,
by
the
suspicion
of
personal
feeling
that
his
warmth
might
be
creating
in
Hans
.
<EOS>
He
could
come
to
no
result
,
but
that
the
position
was
peculiar
,
and
that
he
could
make
no
further
provision
against
dangers
until
they
came
nearer
.
<EOS>
To
save
an
unhappy
Jewess
from
drowning
herself
,
would
not
have
seemed
a
startling
variation
among
police
reports
;
but
to
discover
in
her
so
rare
a
creature
as
Mirah
,
was
an
exceptional
event
which
might
well
bring
exceptional
consequences
.
<EOS>
Deronda
would
not
let
himself
for
a
moment
dwell
on
any
supposition
that
the
consequences
might
enter
deeply
into
his
own
life
.
<EOS>
The
image
of
Mirah
had
never
yet
had
that
penetrating
radiation
which
would
have
been
given
to
it
by
the
idea
of
her
loving
him
.
<EOS>
When
this
sort
of
effluence
is
absent
from
the
fancy
(
whether
from
the
fact
or
not
)
a
man
may
go
far
in
devotedness
without
perturbation
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
the
search
for
Mirah
's
mother
and
brother
,
Deronda
took
what
she
had
said
to
-
day
as
a
warrant
for
deferring
any
immediate
measures
.
<EOS>
His
conscience
was
not
quite
easy
in
this
desire
for
delay
,
any
more
than
it
was
quite
easy
in
his
not
attempting
to
learn
the
truth
about
his
own
mother
:
in
both
cases
he
felt
that
there
might
be
an
unfulfilled
duty
to
a
parent
,
but
in
both
cases
there
was
an
overpowering
repugnance
to
the
possible
truth
,
which
threw
a
turning
weight
into
the
scale
of
argument
.
  
<EOS>
"
At
least
,
I
will
look
about
,
"
was
his
final
determination
.
<EOS>
"
I
may
find
some
special
Jewish
machinery
.
<EOS>
I
will
wait
till
after
Christmas
.
"
  
<EOS>
What
should
we
all
do
without
the
calendar
,
when
we
want
to
put
off
a
disagreeable
duty
?
<EOS>
The
admirable
arrangements
of
the
solar
system
,
by
which
our
time
is
measured
,
always
supply
us
with
a
term
before
which
it
is
hardly
worth
while
to
set
about
anything
we
are
disinclined
to
.
        
<EOS>
"
No
man
,
"
says
a
Rabbi
,
by
way
of
indisputable
instance
,
"
may
turn
the
    
bones
of
his
father
and
mother
into
spoons
"
 
sure
that
his
hearers
    
felt
the
checks
against
that
form
of
economy
.
<EOS>
The
market
for
spoons
    
has
never
expanded
enough
for
any
one
to
say
,
"
Why
not
?
"
and
to
argue
    
that
human
progress
lies
in
such
an
application
of
material
.
<EOS>
The
only
    
check
to
be
alleged
is
a
sentiment
,
which
will
coerce
none
who
do
not
    
hold
that
sentiments
are
the
better
part
of
the
world
's
wealth
.
   
<EOS>
Deronda
meanwhile
took
to
a
less
fashionable
form
of
exercise
than
riding
in
Rotten
Row
.
<EOS>
He
went
often
rambling
in
those
parts
of
London
which
are
most
inhabited
by
common
Jews
.
<EOS>
He
walked
to
the
synagogues
at
times
of
service
,
he
looked
into
shops
,
he
observed
faces
:
 
<EOS>
a
process
not
very
promising
of
particular
discovery
.
<EOS>
Why
did
he
not
address
himself
to
an
influential
Rabbi
or
other
member
of
a
Jewish
community
,
to
consult
on
the
chances
of
finding
a
mother
named
Cohen
,
with
a
son
named
Ezra
,
and
a
lost
daughter
named
Mirah
?
<EOS>
He
thought
of
doing
so
 
after
Christmas
.
<EOS>
The
fact
was
,
notwithstanding
all
his
sense
of
poetry
in
common
things
,
Deronda
,
where
a
keen
personal
interest
was
aroused
,
could
not
,
more
than
the
rest
of
us
,
continuously
escape
suffering
from
the
pressure
of
that
hard
unaccommodating
Actual
,
which
has
never
consulted
our
taste
and
is
entirely
unselect
.
<EOS>
Enthusiasm
,
we
know
,
dwells
at
ease
among
ideas
,
tolerates
garlic
breathed
in
the
middle
ages
,
and
sees
no
shabbiness
in
the
official
trappings
of
classic
processions
:
it
gets
squeamish
when
ideals
press
upon
it
as
something
warmly
incarnate
,
and
can
hardly
face
them
without
fainting
.
<EOS>
Lying
dreamily
in
a
boat
,
imagining
one
's
self
in
quest
of
a
beautiful
maiden
's
relatives
in
Cordova
elbowed
by
Jews
in
the
time
of
Ibn
-
Gebirol
,
all
the
physical
incidents
can
be
borne
without
shock
.
<EOS>
Or
if
the
scenery
of
St.
Mary
Axe
and
Whitechapel
were
imaginatively
transported
to
the
borders
of
the
Rhine
at
the
end
of
the
eleventh
century
,
when
in
the
ears
listening
for
the
signals
of
the
Messiah
,
the
Hep
!
<EOS>
Hep
!
<EOS>
Hep
!
<EOS>
of
the
Crusaders
came
like
the
bay
of
blood
-
hounds
;
and
in
the
presence
of
those
devilish
missionaries
with
sword
and
firebrand
the
crouching
figure
of
the
reviled
Jew
turned
round
erect
,
heroic
,
flashing
with
sublime
constancy
in
the
face
of
torture
and
death
 
<EOS>
what
would
the
dingy
shops
and
unbeautiful
faces
signify
to
the
thrill
of
contemplative
emotion
?
<EOS>
But
the
fervor
of
sympathy
with
which
we
contemplate
a
grandiose
martyrdom
is
feeble
compared
with
the
enthusiasm
that
keeps
unslacked
where
there
is
no
danger
,
no
challenge
 
<EOS>
nothing
but
impartial
midday
falling
on
commonplace
,
perhaps
half
-
repulsive
,
objects
which
are
really
the
beloved
ideas
made
flesh
.
<EOS>
Here
undoubtedly
lies
the
chief
poetic
energy
:
 
in
the
force
of
imagination
that
pierces
or
exalts
the
solid
fact
,
instead
of
floating
among
cloud
-
pictures
.
<EOS>
To
glory
in
a
prophetic
vision
of
knowledge
covering
the
earth
,
is
an
easier
exercise
of
believing
imagination
than
to
see
its
beginning
in
newspaper
placards
,
staring
at
you
from
the
bridge
beyond
the
corn
-
fields
;
and
it
might
well
happen
to
most
of
us
dainty
people
that
we
were
in
the
thick
of
the
battle
of
Armageddon
without
being
aware
of
anything
more
than
the
annoyance
of
a
little
explosive
smoke
and
struggling
on
the
ground
immediately
about
us
.
  
<EOS>
It
lay
in
Deronda
's
nature
usually
to
contemn
the
feeble
,
fastidious
sympathy
which
shrinks
from
the
broad
life
of
mankind
;
but
now
,
with
Mirah
before
him
as
a
living
reality
,
whose
experience
he
had
to
care
for
,
he
saw
every
common
Jew
and
Jewess
in
the
light
of
a
comparison
with
her
,
and
had
a
presentiment
of
the
collision
between
her
idea
of
the
unknown
mother
and
brother
and
the
discovered
fact
 
a
presentiment
all
the
keener
in
him
because
of
a
suppressed
consciousness
that
a
not
unlike
possibility
of
collision
might
lie
hidden
in
his
own
lot
.
<EOS>
Not
that
he
would
have
looked
with
more
complacency
of
expectation
at
wealthy
Jews
,
outdoing
the
lords
of
the
Philistines
in
their
sports
;
but
since
there
was
no
likelihood
of
Mirah
's
friends
being
found
among
that
class
,
their
habits
did
not
immediately
affect
him
.
<EOS>
In
this
mood
he
rambled
,
without
expectation
of
a
more
pregnant
result
than
a
little
preparation
of
his
own
mind
,
perhaps
for
future
theorizing
as
well
as
practice
 
very
much
as
if
,
Mirah
being
related
to
Welsh
miners
,
he
had
gone
to
look
more
closely
at
the
ways
of
those
people
,
not
without
wishing
at
the
same
time
to
get
a
little
light
of
detail
on
the
history
of
Strikes
.
  
<EOS>
He
really
did
not
long
to
find
anybody
in
particular
;
and
when
,
as
his
habit
was
,
he
looked
at
the
name
over
a
shop
door
,
he
was
well
content
that
it
was
not
Ezra
Cohen
.
<EOS>
I
confess
,
he
particularly
desired
that
Ezra
Cohen
should
not
keep
a
shop
.
<EOS>
Wishes
are
held
to
be
ominous
;
according
to
which
belief
the
order
of
the
world
is
so
arranged
that
if
you
have
an
impious
objection
to
a
squint
,
your
offspring
is
the
more
likely
to
be
born
with
one
;
also
,
that
if
you
happened
to
desire
a
squint
you
would
not
get
it
.
<EOS>
This
desponding
view
of
probability
the
hopeful
entirely
reject
,
taking
their
wishes
as
good
and
sufficient
security
for
all
kinds
of
fulfilment
.
<EOS>
Who
is
absolutely
neutral
?
<EOS>
Deronda
happening
one
morning
to
turn
into
a
little
side
street
out
of
the
noise
and
obstructions
of
Holborn
,
felt
the
scale
dip
on
the
desponding
side
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
rather
tired
of
the
streets
and
had
paused
to
hail
a
hansom
cab
which
he
saw
coming
,
when
his
attention
was
caught
by
some
fine
old
clasps
in
chased
silver
displayed
in
the
window
at
his
right
hand
.
<EOS>
His
first
thought
was
that
Lady
Mallinger
,
who
had
a
strictly
Protestant
taste
for
such
Catholic
spoils
,
might
like
to
have
these
missal
-
clasps
turned
into
a
bracelet
:
then
his
eyes
traveled
over
the
other
contents
of
the
window
,
and
he
saw
that
the
shop
was
that
kind
of
pawnbroker
's
where
the
lead
is
given
to
jewelry
,
lace
and
all
equivocal
objects
introduced
as
_
bric
-
à
-
brac
_
.
<EOS>
A
placard
in
one
corner
announced
 
<EOS>
_
Watches
and
Jewelry
exchanged
and
repaired
_
.
<EOS>
But
his
survey
had
been
noticed
from
within
,
and
a
figure
appeared
at
the
door
,
looking
round
at
him
and
saying
in
a
tone
of
cordial
encouragement
,
"
Good
day
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
instant
was
enough
for
Deronda
to
see
the
face
,
unmistakably
Jewish
,
belonged
to
a
young
man
about
thirty
,
and
wincing
from
the
shopkeeper
's
persuasiveness
that
would
probably
follow
,
he
had
no
sooner
returned
the
"
good
day
,
"
than
he
passed
to
the
other
side
of
the
street
and
beckoned
to
the
cabman
to
draw
up
there
.
<EOS>
From
that
station
he
saw
the
name
over
the
shop
window
 
Ezra
Cohen
.
  
<EOS>
There
might
be
a
hundred
Ezra
Cohens
lettered
above
shop
windows
,
but
Deronda
had
not
seen
them
.
<EOS>
Probably
the
young
man
interested
in
a
possible
customer
was
Ezra
himself
;
and
he
was
about
the
age
to
be
expected
in
Mirah
's
brother
,
who
was
grown
up
while
she
was
still
a
little
child
.
<EOS>
But
Deronda
's
first
endeavor
as
he
drove
homeward
was
to
convince
himself
that
there
was
not
the
slightest
warrantable
presumption
of
this
Ezra
being
Mirah
's
brother
;
and
next
,
that
even
if
,
in
spite
of
good
reasoning
,
he
turned
out
to
be
that
brother
,
while
on
inquiry
the
mother
was
found
to
be
dead
,
it
was
not
his
 
Deronda
's
 
duty
to
make
known
the
discovery
to
Mirah
.
<EOS>
In
inconvenient
disturbance
of
this
conclusion
there
came
his
lately
-
acquired
knowledge
that
Mirah
would
have
a
religious
desire
to
know
of
her
mother
's
death
,
and
also
to
learn
whether
her
brother
were
living
.
<EOS>
How
far
was
he
justified
in
determining
another
life
by
his
own
notions
?
<EOS>
Was
it
not
his
secret
complaint
against
the
way
in
which
others
had
ordered
his
own
life
,
that
he
had
not
open
daylight
on
all
its
relations
,
so
that
he
had
not
,
like
other
men
,
the
full
guidance
of
primary
duties
?
  
<EOS>
The
immediate
relief
from
this
inward
debate
was
the
reflection
that
he
had
not
yet
made
any
real
discovery
,
and
that
by
looking
into
the
facts
more
closely
he
should
be
certified
that
there
was
no
demand
on
him
for
any
decision
<EOS>
whatever
.
<EOS>
He
intended
to
return
to
that
shop
as
soon
as
he
could
conveniently
,
and
buy
the
clasps
for
Lady
Mallinger
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
hindered
for
several
days
by
Sir
Hugo
,
who
,
about
to
make
an
after
-
dinner
speech
on
a
burning
topic
,
wanted
Deronda
to
forage
for
him
on
the
legal
part
of
the
question
,
besides
wasting
time
every
day
on
argument
which
always
ended
in
a
drawn
battle
.
<EOS>
As
on
many
other
questions
,
they
held
different
sides
,
but
Sir
Hugo
did
not
mind
this
,
and
when
Deronda
put
his
point
well
,
said
,
with
a
mixture
of
satisfaction
and
regret
    
"
Confound
it
,
Dan
!
<EOS>
why
do
n't
you
make
an
opportunity
of
saying
these
things
in
public
?
<EOS>
You
're
wrong
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
succeed
.
<EOS>
You
've
got
the
massive
sentiment
 
<EOS>
the
heavy
artillery
of
the
country
against
you
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
all
the
better
ground
for
a
young
man
to
display
himself
on
.
<EOS>
When
I
was
your
age
,
I
should
have
taken
it
.
<EOS>
And
it
would
be
quite
as
well
for
you
to
be
in
opposition
to
me
here
and
there
.
<EOS>
It
would
throw
you
more
into
relief
.
<EOS>
If
you
would
seize
an
occasion
of
this
sort
to
make
an
impression
,
you
might
be
in
Parliament
in
no
time
.
<EOS>
And
you
know
that
would
gratify
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
not
to
do
what
would
gratify
you
,
sir
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
can
not
persuade
myself
to
look
at
politics
as
a
profession
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
<EOS>
if
a
man
is
not
born
into
public
life
by
his
position
in
the
country
,
there
's
no
way
for
him
but
to
embrace
it
by
his
own
efforts
.
<EOS>
The
business
of
the
country
must
be
done
 
her
Majesty
's
Government
carried
on
,
as
the
old
Duke
said
.
<EOS>
And
it
never
could
be
,
<EOS>
my
boy
,
if
everybody
looked
at
politics
as
if
they
were
prophecy
,
and
demanded
an
inspired
vocation
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
to
get
into
Parliament
,
it
wo
n't
do
to
sit
still
and
wait
for
a
call
either
from
heaven
or
constituents
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
to
make
a
living
out
of
opinions
,
"
said
Deronda
;
"
especially
out
of
borrowed
opinions
.
<EOS>
Not
that
I
mean
to
blame
other
men
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
<EOS>
many
better
fellows
than
I
do
n't
mind
getting
on
to
a
platform
to
praise
themselves
,
and
giving
their
word
of
honor
for
a
party
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
Dan
,
"
said
Sir
Hugo
,
"
a
man
who
sets
his
face
against
every
sort
of
humbug
is
simply
a
three
-
cornered
,
impracticable
fellow
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
bad
style
of
humbug
,
but
there
is
also
a
good
style
 
one
that
oils
the
wheels
and
makes
progress
possible
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
to
rule
men
,
you
must
rule
them
through
their
own
ideas
;
and
I
agree
with
the
Archbishop
at
Naples
who
had
a
St.
Januarius
procession
against
the
plague
.
<EOS>
It
's
no
use
having
an
Order
in
Council
against
popular
shallowness
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
action
possible
without
a
little
acting
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
One
may
be
obliged
to
give
way
to
an
occasional
necessity
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
one
thing
to
say
,
"
In
this
particular
case
I
am
forced
to
put
on
this
foolscap
and
grin
,
"
and
another
to
buy
a
pocket
foolscap
and
practice
myself
in
grinning
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
see
any
real
public
expediency
that
does
not
keep
an
ideal
before
it
which
makes
a
limit
of
deviation
from
the
direct
path
.
<EOS>
But
if
I
were
to
set
up
for
a
public
man
I
might
mistake
my
success
for
public
expediency
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
after
this
dialogue
,
which
was
rather
jarring
to
him
,
that
Deronda
set
out
on
his
meditated
second
visit
to
Ezra
Cohen
's
.
<EOS>
He
entered
the
street
at
the
end
opposite
to
the
Holborn
entrance
,
and
an
inward
reluctance
slackened
his
pace
while
his
thoughts
were
transferring
what
he
had
just
been
saying
about
public
expediency
to
the
entirely
private
difficulty
which
brought
him
back
again
into
this
unattractive
thoroughfare
.
<EOS>
It
might
soon
become
an
immediate
practical
question
with
him
how
far
he
could
call
it
a
wise
expediency
to
conceal
the
fact
of
close
kindred
.
<EOS>
Such
questions
turning
up
constantly
in
life
are
often
decided
in
a
rough
-
and
-
ready
way
;
and
to
many
it
will
appear
an
over
-
refinement
in
Deronda
that
he
should
make
any
great
point
of
a
matter
confined
to
his
own
knowledge
.
<EOS>
But
we
have
seen
the
reasons
why
he
had
come
to
regard
concealment
as
a
bane
of
life
,
and
the
necessity
of
concealment
as
a
mark
by
which
lines
of
action
were
to
be
avoided
.
<EOS>
The
prospect
of
being
urged
against
the
confirmed
habit
of
his
mind
was
naturally
grating
.
<EOS>
He
even
paused
here
<EOS>
and
there
before
the
most
plausible
shop
-
windows
for
a
gentleman
to
look
into
,
half
inclined
to
decide
that
he
would
not
increase
his
knowledge
about
that
modern
Ezra
,
who
was
certainly
not
a
leader
among
his
people
 
<EOS>
a
hesitation
which
proved
how
,
in
a
man
much
given
to
reasoning
,
a
bare
possibility
may
weigh
more
than
the
best
-
clad
likelihood
;
for
Deronda
's
reasoning
had
decided
that
all
likelihood
was
against
this
man
's
being
Mirah
's
brother
.
  
<EOS>
One
of
the
shop
-
windows
he
paused
before
was
that
of
a
second
-
hand
book
-
shop
,
where
,
on
a
narrow
table
outside
,
the
literature
of
the
ages
was
represented
in
judicious
mixture
,
from
the
immortal
verse
of
Homer
to
the
mortal
prose
of
the
railway
novel
.
<EOS>
That
the
mixture
was
judicious
was
apparent
from
Deronda
's
finding
in
it
something
that
he
wanted
 
namely
,
that
wonderful
bit
of
autobiography
,
the
life
of
the
Polish
Jew
,
Salomon
Maimon
;
which
,
as
he
could
easily
slip
it
into
his
pocket
,
he
took
from
its
place
,
and
entered
the
shop
to
pay
for
,
expecting
to
see
behind
the
counter
a
grimy
personage
showing
that
_
nonchalance
_
about
sales
which
seems
to
belong
universally
to
the
second
-
hand
book
-
business
.
<EOS>
In
most
other
trades
you
find
generous
men
who
are
anxious
to
sell
you
their
wares
for
your
own
welfare
;
but
even
a
Jew
will
not
urge
Simson
's
Euclid
on
you
with
an
affectionate
assurance
that
you
will
have
pleasure
in
reading
it
,
and
that
he
wishes
he
had
twenty
more
of
the
article
,
so
much
is
it
in
request
.
<EOS>
One
is
led
to
fear
that
a
secondhand
bookseller
may
belong
to
that
unhappy
class
of
men
who
have
no
belief
in
the
good
of
what
they
get
their
living
by
,
yet
keep
conscience
enough
to
be
morose
rather
than
unctuous
in
their
vocation
.
  
<EOS>
But
instead
of
the
ordinary
tradesman
,
he
saw
,
on
the
dark
background
of
books
in
the
long
narrow
shop
,
a
figure
that
was
somewhat
startling
in
its
unusualness
.
<EOS>
A
man
in
threadbare
clothing
,
whose
age
was
difficult
to
guess
 
from
the
dead
yellowish
flatness
of
the
flesh
,
something
like
an
old
ivory
carving
 
was
seated
on
a
stool
against
some
bookshelves
that
projected
beyond
the
short
counter
,
doing
nothing
more
remarkable
than
reading
yesterday

Times
_
;
but
when
he
let
the
paper
rest
on
his
lap
and
looked
at
the
incoming
customer
,
the
thought
glanced
through
Deronda
that
precisely
such
a
physiognomy
as
that
might
possibly
have
been
seen
in
a
prophet
of
the
Exile
,
or
in
some
New
Hebrew
poet
of
the
mediæval
time
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
fine
typical
Jewish
face
,
wrought
into
intensity
of
expression
apparently
by
a
strenuous
eager
experience
in
which
all
the
satisfaction
had
been
indirect
and
far
off
,
and
perhaps
by
some
bodily
suffering
also
,
which
involved
that
absence
of
ease
in
the
present
.
<EOS>
The
features
were
clear
-
cut
,
not
large
;
the
brow
not
high
but
broad
,
and
fully
defined
by
the
crisp
black
hair
.
<EOS>
It
might
never
have
been
a
particularly
handsome
face
,
but
it
must
always
have
been
forcible
;
and
now
with
its
dark
,
far
-
off
gaze
,
and
yellow
pallor
in
relief
on
the
gloom
of
the
backward
shop
,
one
might
have
imagined
one
's
self
coming
upon
it
in
some
past
prison
of
the
Inquisition
,
which
a
mob
had
suddenly
burst
upon
;
while
the
look
fixed
on
an
incidental
customer
seemed
eager
and
questioning
enough
to
have
been
turned
on
one
who
might
have
been
a
messenger
either
of
delivery
or
of
death
.
<EOS>
The
figure
was
probably
familiar
and
unexciting
enough
to
the
inhabitants
of
this
street
;
but
to
Deronda
's
mind
it
brought
so
strange
a
blending
of
the
unwonted
with
the
common
,
that
there
was
a
perceptible
interval
of
mutual
observation
before
he
asked
his
question
;
"
What
is
the
price
of
this
book
?
"
  
<EOS>
After
taking
the
book
and
examining
the
fly
-
leaves
without
rising
,
the
supposed
bookseller
said
,
"
There
is
no
mark
,
and
Mr.
Ram
is
not
in
now
.
<EOS>
I
am
keeping
the
shop
while
he
is
gone
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
What
are
you
disposed
to
give
for
it
?
"
<EOS>
He
held
the
book
close
on
his
lap
with
his
hand
on
it
and
looked
examiningly
at
Deronda
,
over
whom
there
came
the
disagreeable
idea
,
that
possibly
this
striking
personage
wanted
to
see
how
much
could
be
got
out
of
a
customer
's
ignorance
of
prices
.
<EOS>
But
without
further
reflection
he
said
,
"
Do
n't
you
know
how
much
it
is
worth
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
its
market
-
price
.
<EOS>
May
I
ask
have
you
read
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
I
have
read
an
account
of
it
,
which
makes
me
want
to
buy
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
man
of
learning
 
<EOS>
you
are
interested
in
Jewish
history
?
<EOS>
"
This
was
said
in
a
deepened
tone
of
eager
inquiry
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
certainly
interested
in
Jewish
history
,
"
said
Deronda
,
quietly
,
curiosity
overcoming
his
dislike
to
the
sort
of
inspection
as
well
as
questioning
he
was
under
.
  
<EOS>
But
immediately
the
strange
Jew
rose
from
his
sitting
posture
,
and
Deronda
felt
a
thin
hand
pressing
his
arm
tightly
,
while
a
hoarse
,
excited
voice
,
not
much
above
a
loud
whisper
,
said
    
"
You
are
perhaps
of
our
race
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
colored
deeply
,
not
liking
the
grasp
,
and
then
answered
with
a
slight
shake
of
the
head
,
"
No
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
grasp
was
relaxed
,
the
hand
withdrawn
,
the
eagerness
of
the
face
collapsed
into
uninterested
melancholy
,
as
if
some
possessing
spirit
which
had
leaped
into
the
eyes
and
gestures
had
sunk
back
again
to
the
inmost
recesses
of
the
frame
;
and
moving
further
off
as
he
held
out
the
little
book
,
the
stranger
said
in
a
tone
of
distant
civility
,
"
I
believe
Mr.
Ram
will
be
satisfied
with
half
-
a
-
crown
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
effect
of
this
change
on
Deronda
 
<EOS>
he
afterward
smiled
when
he
recalled
it
 
<EOS>
was
oddly
embarrassing
and
humiliating
,
as
if
some
high
dignitary
had
found
him
deficient
and
given
him
his
_
congé
_
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
further
to
be
said
,
however
:
he
paid
his
half
-
crown
and
carried
off
his
_
Salomon
Maimon
's
Lebensgeschichte
_
with
a
mere
"
good
-
morning
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
felt
some
vexation
at
the
sudden
arrest
of
the
interview
,
and
the
apparent
prohibition
that
he
should
know
more
of
this
man
,
who
was
certainly
something
out
of
the
common
way
 
as
different
probably
as
a
Jew
could
well
be
from
Ezra
Cohen
,
through
whose
door
Deronda
was
presently
entering
,
and
whose
flourishing
face
glistening
on
the
way
to
fatness
was
hanging
over
the
counter
in
negotiation
with
some
one
on
the
other
side
of
the
partition
,
concerning
two
plated
stoppers
and
three
teaspoons
,
which
lay
spread
before
him
.
<EOS>
Seeing
Deronda
enter
,
he
called
out
"
Mother
!
<EOS>
Mother
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
with
a
familiar
nod
and
smile
,
said
,
"
Coming
,
sir
 
coming
directly
.
<EOS>
"
  
Deronda
could
not
help
looking
toward
the
door
from
the
back
with
some
anxiety
,
which
was
not
soothed
when
he
saw
a
vigorous
woman
beyond
fifty
enter
and
approach
to
serve
him
.
<EOS>
Not
that
there
was
anything
very
repulsive
about
her
:
<EOS>
the
worst
that
could
be
said
was
that
she
had
that
look
of
having
made
her
toilet
with
little
water
,
and
by
twilight
,
which
is
common
to
unyouthful
people
of
her
class
,
and
of
having
presumably
slept
in
her
large
earrings
,
if
not
in
her
rings
and
necklace
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
what
caused
a
sinking
of
heart
in
Deronda
was
,
her
not
being
so
coarse
and
ugly
as
to
exclude
the
idea
of
her
being
Mirah
's
mother
.
<EOS>
Any
one
who
has
looked
at
a
face
to
try
and
discern
signs
of
known
kinship
in
it
will
understand
his
process
of
conjecture
 
how
he
tried
to
think
away
the
fat
which
had
gradually
disguised
the
outlines
of
youth
,
and
to
discern
what
one
may
call
the
elementary
expressions
of
the
face
.
<EOS>
He
was
sorry
to
see
no
absolute
negative
to
his
fears
.
<EOS>
Just
as
it
was
conceivable
that
this
Ezra
,
brought
up
to
trade
,
might
resemble
the
scapegrace
father
in
everything
but
his
knowledge
and
talent
,
so
it
was
not
impossible
that
this
mother
might
have
had
a
lovely
refined
daughter
whose
type
of
feature
and
expression
was
like
Mirah
's
.
<EOS>
The
eyebrows
had
a
vexatious
similarity
of
line
;
and
who
shall
decide
how
far
a
face
may
be
masked
when
the
uncherishing
years
have
thrust
it
far
onward
in
the
ever
-
new
procession
of
youth
and
age
?
<EOS>
The
good
-
humor
of
the
glance
remained
and
shone
out
in
a
motherly
way
at
Deronda
,
as
she
said
,
in
a
mild
guttural
tone
    
"
How
can
I
serve
you
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
look
at
the
silver
clasps
in
the
window
,
"
said
Deronda
;
"
the
larger
ones
,
please
,
in
the
corner
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
not
quite
easy
to
get
at
from
the
mother
's
station
,
and
the
son
seeing
this
called
out
,
"
I
'll
reach
'em
,
mother
;
I
'll
reach
'
em
,
"
running
forward
with
alacrity
,
and
then
handing
the
clasps
to
Deronda
with
the
smiling
remark
    
<EOS>
"
Mother
's
too
proud
:
she
wants
to
do
everything
herself
.
<EOS>
That
's
why
I
called
her
to
wait
on
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
When
there
's
a
particular
gentleman
customer
,
sir
,
I
dare
n't
do
any
other
than
call
her
.
<EOS>
But
I
ca
n't
let
her
do
herself
mischief
with
stretching
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Here
Mr.
Cohen
made
way
again
for
his
parent
,
who
gave
a
little
guttural
,
amiable
laugh
while
she
looked
at
Deronda
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
This
boy
will
be
at
his
jokes
,
but
you
see
he
's
the
best
son
in
the
world
,
"
and
evidently
the
son
enjoyed
pleasing
her
,
though
he
also
wished
to
convey
an
apology
to
his
distinguished
customer
for
not
giving
him
the
advantage
of
his
own
exclusive
attention
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
began
to
examine
the
clasps
as
if
he
had
many
points
to
observe
before
he
could
come
to
a
decision
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
only
three
guineas
,
sir
,
"
said
the
mother
,
encouragingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
First
-
rate
workmanship
,
sir
 
worth
twice
the
money
;
only
I
get
'em
a
bargain
from
Cologne
,
"
said
the
son
,
parenthetically
,
from
a
distance
.
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
two
new
customers
entered
,
and
the
repeated
call
,
"
Addy
!
"
brought
from
the
back
of
the
shop
a
group
that
Deronda
turned
frankly
to
stare
at
,
feeling
sure
that
the
stare
would
be
held
complimentary
.
<EOS>
The
group
consisted
of
a
black
-
eyed
young
woman
who
carried
a
black
-
eyed
little
one
,
its
head
already
covered
with
black
curls
,
and
deposited
it
on
the
counter
,
from
which
station
<EOS>
it
looked
round
with
even
more
than
the
usual
intelligence
of
babies
:
<EOS>
also
a
robust
boy
of
six
and
a
younger
girl
,
both
with
black
eyes
and
black
-
ringed
hair
 
looking
more
Semitic
than
their
parents
,
as
the
puppy
lions
show
the
spots
of
far
-
off
progenitors
.
<EOS>
The
young
woman
answering
to
"
Addy
"
 
a
sort
of
paroquet
in
a
bright
blue
dress
,
with
coral
necklace
and
earrings
,
her
hair
set
up
in
a
huge
bush
 
looked
as
complacently
lively
and
unrefined
as
her
husband
;
and
by
a
certain
difference
from
the
mother
deepened
in
Deronda
the
unwelcome
impression
that
the
latter
was
not
so
utterly
common
a
Jewess
as
to
exclude
her
being
the
mother
of
Mirah
.
<EOS>
While
that
thought
was
glancing
through
his
mind
,
the
boy
had
run
forward
into
the
shop
with
an
energetic
stamp
,
and
setting
himself
about
four
feet
from
Deronda
,
with
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
miniature
knickerbockers
,
looked
at
him
with
a
precocious
air
of
survey
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
was
chiefly
with
a
diplomatic
design
to
linger
and
ingratiate
himself
that
Deronda
patted
the
boy
's
head
,
saying
    
"
What
is
your
name
,
sirrah
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Jacob
Alexander
Cohen
,
"
said
the
small
man
,
with
much
ease
and
distinctness
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
named
after
your
father
,
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
after
my
grandfather
;
he
sells
knives
and
razors
and
scissors
 
<EOS>
my
grandfather
does
,
"
said
Jacob
,
wishing
to
impress
the
stranger
with
that
high
connection
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
gave
me
this
knife
.
<EOS>
"
Here
a
pocket
-
knife
was
drawn
forth
,
and
the
small
fingers
,
both
naturally
and
artificially
dark
,
opened
two
blades
and
a
cork
-
screw
with
much
quickness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
not
that
a
dangerous
plaything
?
"
said
Deronda
,
turning
to
the
grandmother
.
  
<EOS>
"
_
He_'ll
never
hurt
himself
,
bless
you
!
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
contemplating
her
grandson
with
placid
rapture
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
_
you
_
got
a
knife
?
"
says
Jacob
,
coming
closer
.
<EOS>
His
small
voice
was
hoarse
in
its
glibness
,
as
if
it
belonged
to
an
aged
commercial
soul
,
fatigued
with
bargaining
through
many
generations
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
Do
you
want
to
see
it
?
"
said
Deronda
,
taking
a
small
penknife
from
his
waistcoat
-
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
Jacob
seized
it
immediately
and
retreated
a
little
,
holding
the
two
knives
in
his
palms
and
bending
over
them
in
meditative
comparison
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
other
clients
were
gone
,
and
the
whole
family
had
gathered
to
the
spot
,
centering
their
attention
on
the
marvelous
Jacob
:
the
father
,
mother
,
and
grandmother
behind
the
counter
,
with
baby
held
staggering
thereon
,
and
the
little
girl
in
front
leaning
at
her
brother
's
elbow
to
assist
him
in
looking
at
the
knives
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mine
's
the
best
,
"
said
Jacob
,
at
last
,
returning
Deronda
's
knife
as
if
he
had
been
entertaining
the
idea
of
exchange
and
had
rejected
it
.
  
<EOS>
Father
and
mother
laughed
aloud
with
delight
.
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
find
Jacob
choosing
the
worst
,
"
said
Mr.
Cohen
,
winking
,
with
much
confidence
in
the
customer
's
admiration
.
<EOS>
Deronda
,
looking
at
the
grandmother
,
who
had
only
an
inward
silent
laugh
,
said
    
"
Are
these
the
only
grandchildren
you
have
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
All
.
<EOS>
This
is
my
only
son
,
"
she
answered
in
a
communicative
tone
,
Deronda
's
glance
and
manner
as
usual
conveying
the
impression
of
sympathetic
interest
 
which
on
this
occasion
answered
his
purpose
well
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
come
naturally
enough
that
he
should
say
    
"
<EOS>
And
you
have
no
daughter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
an
instantaneous
change
in
the
mother
's
face
.
<EOS>
Her
lips
closed
more
firmly
,
she
looked
down
,
swept
her
hands
outward
on
the
counter
,
and
finally
turned
her
back
on
Deronda
to
examine
some
Indian
handkerchiefs
that
hung
in
pawn
behind
her
.
<EOS>
Her
son
gave
a
significant
glance
,
set
up
his
shoulders
an
instant
and
just
put
his
fingers
to
his
lips
,
 
then
said
quickly
,
"
I
think
you
're
a
first
-
rate
gentleman
in
the
city
,
sir
,
if
I
may
be
allowed
to
guess
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Deronda
,
with
a
preoccupied
air
,
"
I
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
city
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
bad
job
.
<EOS>
I
thought
you
might
be
the
young
principal
of
a
first
-
rate
firm
,
"
said
Mr.
Cohen
,
wishing
to
make
amends
for
the
check
on
his
customer
's
natural
desire
to
know
more
of
him
and
his
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
understand
silver
-
work
,
I
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
A
little
,
"
said
Deronda
,
taking
up
the
clasps
a
moment
and
laying
them
down
again
.
<EOS>
That
unwelcome
bit
of
circumstantial
evidence
had
made
his
mind
busy
with
a
plan
which
was
certainly
more
like
acting
than
anything
he
had
been
aware
of
in
his
own
conduct
before
.
<EOS>
But
the
bare
possibility
that
more
knowledge
might
nullify
the
evidence
now
overpowered
the
inclination

To

you
the

he
went
on

my
errand
is
not
so
much
to
buy

I
dare
say
you
go
into
rather
heavy
transactions
occasionally
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
I
've
accommodated
gentlemen
of
distinction
 
<EOS>
I
'm
proud
to
say
it
.
<EOS>
I
would
n't
exchange
my
business
with
any
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
There
's
none
more
honorable
,
nor
more
charitable
,
nor
more
necessary
for
all
classes
,
from
the
good
lady
who
wants
a
little
of
the
ready
for
the
baker
,
to
a
gentleman
like
yourself
,
sir
,
who
may
want
it
for
amusement
.
<EOS>
I
like
my
business
,
I
like
my
street
,
and
I
like
my
shop
.
<EOS>
I
would
n't
have
it
a
door
further
down
.
<EOS>
And
I
would
n't
be
without
a
pawn
-
shop
,
sir
,
to
be
the
Lord
Mayor
.
<EOS>
It
puts
you
in
connection
with
the
world
at
large
.
<EOS>
I
say
it
's
like
the
government
revenue
 
<EOS>
it
embraces
the
brass
as
well
as
the
gold
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
And
a
man
who
does
n't
get
money
,
sir
,
ca
n't
accommodate
.
<EOS>
Now
,
what
can
I
do
for
_
<EOS>
you
_
,
sir
?

<EOS>
If
an
amiable
self

satisfaction

the
mark

bliss

Solomon
in
all
his
glory
was
a
pitiable
mortal
compared
with
Mr.
Cohen
 
clearly
one
of
those
persons
,
who
,
being
in
excellent
spirits
about
themselves
,
are
willing
to
cheer
strangers
by
letting
them
know
it
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
delivering
himself
with
lively
rapidity
,
he
took
the
baby
from
his
wife
and
holding
it
on
his
arm
presented
his
features
to
be
explored
by
its
small
fists
.
<EOS>
Deronda
,
not
in
a
cheerful
mood
,
was
rashly
pronouncing
this
Ezra
Cohen
to
be
the
most
unpoetic
Jew
he
had
ever
met
with
in
books
or
life
:
his
phraseology
was
as
little
as
possible
like
that
of
the
Old
Testament
:
and
no
shadow
of
a
suffering
race
distinguished
his
vulgarity
of
soul
from
that
of
a
prosperous
,
pink
-
and
-
white
huckster
of
the
purest
English
lineage
.
<EOS>
It
is
naturally
a
Christian
feeling
that
a
Jew
ought
not
to
be
conceited
.
<EOS>
However
,
this
was
no
reason
for
not
persevering
in
his
project
,
and
he
answered
at
once
in
adventurous
ignorance
of
technicalities
    
"
I
have
a
fine
diamond
ring
to
offer
as
security
 
not
with
me
at
this
moment
,
unfortunately
,
for
I
am
not
in
the
habit
of
wearing
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
come
again
this
evening
and
bring
it
with
me
.
<EOS>
Fifty
pounds
at
once
would
be
a
convenience
to
me

"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
you
know
,
this
evening
is
the
Sabbath
,
young
gentleman
,
"
said
Cohen
,
"
and
I
go
to
the
_
Shool
_
.
<EOS>
The
shop
will
be
closed
.
<EOS>
But
accommodation
is
a
work
of
charity
;
if
you
ca
n't
get
here
before
,
and
are
any
ways
pressed
 
<EOS>
why
,
I
'll
look
at

<EOS>
You
're
perhaps
from
the

End

drive

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
and
your
Sabbath
begins
early
at
this
season
.
<EOS>
I
could
be
here
by
five
 
<EOS>
will
that
do
?
<EOS>
"
Deronda
had
not
been
without
hope
that
by
asking
to
come
on
a
Friday
evening
he
might
get
a
better
opportunity
of
observing
points
in
the
family
character
,
and
might
even
be
able
to
put
some
decisive
question
.
  
<EOS>
Cohen
assented
;
but
here
the
marvelous
Jacob
,
whose
_
physique
_
supported
a
precocity
that
would
have
shattered
a
Gentile
of
his
years
,
showed
that
he
had
been
listening
with
much
comprehension
by
saying
,
"
You
are
coming
again
.
<EOS>
Have
you
got
any
more
knives
at
home
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
have
one
,
"
said
Deronda
,
smiling
down
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Has
it
two
blades
and
a
hook
 
and
a
white
handle
like
that
?
"
said
Jacob
,
pointing
to
the
waistcoat
-
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
it
has
?
"
  
"
Do
you
like
a
cork
-
screw
?
"
said
Jacob
,
exhibiting
that
article
in
his
own
knife
again
,
and
looking
up
with
serious
inquiry
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Deronda
,
experimentally
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bring
your
knife
,
then
,
and
we
'll
shwop
,
"
said
Jacob
,
returning
the
knife
to
his
pocket
,
and
stamping
about
with
the
sense
that
he
had
concluded
a
good
transaction
.
  
<EOS>
The
grandmother
had
now
recovered
her
usual
manners
,
and
the
whole
family
watched
Deronda
radiantly
when
he
caressingly
lifted
the
little
girl
,
to
whom
he
had
not
hitherto
given
attention
,
and
seating
her
on
the
counter
,
asked
for
her
name
also
.
<EOS>
She
looked
at
him
in
silence
,
and
put
her
fingers
to
her
gold
earrings
,
which
he
did
not
seem
to
have
noticed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Adelaide
Rebekah
is
her
name
,
"
said
her
mother
,
proudly
.
<EOS>
"
Speak
to
the

,
lovey
.
"
  
"

said
Adelaide
Rebekah
.
  
<EOS>
"
Her

"
said
the
father
,
in
explanation
.
<EOS>
"
She
'll
have
her
Sabbath
frock
on
this
evening
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
will
you
let
me
see
you
in
it
,
Adelaide
?
"
said
Deronda
,
with
that
gentle
intonation
which
came
very
easily
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Say
yes
,
lovey
 
<EOS>
yes
,
if
you
please
,
sir
,
"
said
her
mother
,
enchanted
with
this
handsome
young
gentleman
,
who
appreciated
remarkable
children
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
will
you
give
me
a
kiss
this
evening
?
"
said
Deronda
with
a
hand
on
each
of
her
little
brown
shoulders
.
  
<EOS>
Adelaide
Rebekah
(
her
miniature
crinoline
and
monumental
features
corresponded
with
the
combination
of
her
names
)
immediately
put
up
her
lips
to
pay
the
kiss
in
advance
;
whereupon
her
father
rising
in
still
more
glowing
satisfaction
with
the
general
meritoriousness
of
his
circumstances
,
and
with
the
stranger
who
was
an
admiring
witness
,
said
cordially
    
"
<EOS>
You
see
there
's
somebody
will
be
disappointed
if
you
do
n't
come
this
evening
,
sir
.
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
mind
sitting
down
in
our
family
place
and
waiting
a
bit
for
me
,
if
I
'm
not
in
when
you
come
,
sir
?
<EOS>
I
'll
stretch
a
point
to
accommodate
a
gent
of
your
sort
.
<EOS>
Bring
the
diamond
,
and
I
'll
see
what
I
can
do
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
thus
left
the
most
favorable
impression
behind
him
,
as
a
preparation
for
more
easy
intercourse
.
<EOS>
But
for
his
own
part
those
amenities
had
been
carried
on
under
the
heaviest
spirits
.
<EOS>
If
these
were
really
Mirah
's
relatives
,
he
could
not
imagine
that
even
her
fervid
filial
piety
could
give
the
reunion
with
them
any
sweetness
beyond
such
as
could
be
found
in
the
strict
fulfillment
of
a
painful
duty
.
<EOS>
What
did
this
vaunting
brother
need
?
<EOS>
And
with
the
most
favorable
supposition
about
the
hypothetic
mother
,
Deronda
shrank
from
the
image
of
a
first
meeting
between
her
and
Mirah
,
and
still
more
from
the
idea
of
Mirah
's
domestication
with
this
family
.
<EOS>
He
took
refuge
in
disbelief
.
<EOS>
To
find
an
Ezra
Cohen
when
the
name
was
running
in
your
head
was
no
more
extraordinary
than
to
find
a
Josiah
Smith
under
like
circumstances
;
and
as
to
the
coincidence
about
the
daughter
,
it
would
probably
turn
out
to
be
a
difference
.
<EOS>
If
,
however
,
further
knowledge
confirmed
the
more
undesirable
conclusion
,
what
would
be
wise
expediency
?
 
<EOS>
to
try
and
determine
the
best
consequences
by
concealment
,
or
to
brave
other
consequences
for
the
sake
of
that
openness
which
is
the
sweet
fresh
air
of
our
moral
life

When
Deronda
arrived
at
five
o'clock
,
the
shop
was
closed
and
the
door
was
opened
for
him
by
the
Christian
servant
.
<EOS>
When
she
showed
him
into
the
room
behind
the
shop
he
was
surprised
at
the
prettiness
of
the
scene
.
<EOS>
The
house
was
old
,
and
rather
extensive
at
the
back
:
probably
the
large
room
he
how
entered
was
gloomy
by
daylight
,
but
now
it
was
agreeably
lit
by
a
fine
old
brass
lamp
with
seven
oil
-
lights
hanging
above
the
snow
-
white
cloth
spread
on
the
central
table
,
The
ceiling
and
walls
were
smoky
,
and
all
the
surroundings
were
dark
enough
to
throw
into
relief
the
human
figures
,
which
had
a
Venetian
glow
of
coloring
.
<EOS>
The
grandmother
was
arrayed
in
yellowish
brown
with
a
large
gold
chain
in
lieu
of
the
necklace
,
and
by
this
light
her
yellow
face
with
its
darkly
-
marked
eyebrows
and
framing
roll
of
gray
hair
looked
as
handsome
as
was
necessary
for
picturesque
effect
.
<EOS>
Young
Mrs.
Cohen
was
clad
in
red
and
black
,
with
a
string
of
large
artificial
pearls
wound
round
and
round
her
neck
:
the
baby
lay
asleep
in
the
cradle
under
a
scarlet
counterpane
;
Adelaide
Rebekah
was
in
braided
amber
,
and
Jacob
Alexander
was
in
black
velveteen
with
scarlet
stockings
.
<EOS>
As
the
four
pairs
of
black
eyes
all
glistened
a
welcome
at
Deronda
,
he
was
almost
ashamed
of
the
supercilious
dislike
these
happy
-
looking
creatures
had
raised
in
him
by
daylight
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
more
cordial
than
the
greeting
he
received
,
and
both
mother
and
grandmother
seemed
to
gather
more
dignity
from
being
seen
on
the
private
hearth
,
showing
hospitality
.
<EOS>
He
looked
round
with
some
wonder
at
the
old
furniture
:
the
oaken
bureau
and
high
side
-
table
must
surely
be
mere
matters
of
chance
and
economy
,
and
not
due
to
the
family
taste
.
<EOS>
A
large
dish
of
blue
and
yellow
ware
was
set
up
on
the
side
-
table
,
and
flanking
it
were
two
old
silver
vessels
;
in
front
of
them
a
large
volume
in
darkened
vellum
with
a
deep
-
ribbed
back
.
<EOS>
In
the
corner
at
the
farther
end
was
an
open
door
into
an
inner
room
,
where
there
was
also
a
light
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
took
in
these
details
by
parenthetic
glances
while
he
met
Jacob
's
pressing
solicitude
about
the
knife
.
<EOS>
He
had
taken
the
pains
to
buy
one
with
the
requisites
of
the
hook
and
white
handle
,
and
produced
it
on
demand
,
saying
,
    
"
Is
that
the
sort
of
thing
you
want
,
Jacob
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
subjected
to
a
severe
scrutiny
,
the
hook
and
blades
were
opened
,
and
the
article
of
barter
with
the
cork
-
screw
was
drawn
forth
for
comparison
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
like
a
hook
better
than
a
cork
-
screw
?
"
said
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
'
Caush
I
can
get
hold
of
things
with
a
hook
.
<EOS>
A
corkscrew
wo
n't
go
into
anything
but
corks
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
better
for
you
,
you
can
draw
corks
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
agree
to
change
,
then
?
"
said
Deronda
,
observing
that
the
grandmother
was
listening
with
delight
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
else
have
you
got
in
your
pockets
?
"
said
Jacob
,
with
deliberative
seriousness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
hush
,
Jacob
,
love
,
"
said
the
grandmother
.
<EOS>
And
Deronda
,
mindful
of
discipline
,
answered
    
"
I
think
I
must
not
tell
you
that
.
<EOS>
Our
business
was
with
the
knives
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jacob
looked
up
into
his
face
scanningly
for
a
moment
or
two
,
and
apparently
arriving
at
his
conclusions
,
said
gravely
    
<EOS>
"
I
'll
shwop
,
"
handing
the
cork
-
screw
knife
to
Deronda
,
who
pocketed
it
with
corresponding
gravity
.
  
<EOS>
Immediately
the
small
son
of
Shem
ran
off
into
the
next
room
,
whence
his
voice
was
heard
in
rapid
chat
;
and
then
ran
back
again
 
when
,
seeing
his
father
enter
,
he
seized
a
little
velveteen
hat
which
lay
on
a
chair
and
put
it
on
to
approach
him
.
<EOS>
Cohen
kept
on
his
own
hat
,
and
took
no
notice
of
the
visitor
,
but
stood
still
while
the
two
children
went
up
to
him
and
clasped
his
knees
:
then
he
laid
his
hands
on
each
in
turn
and
uttered
his
Hebrew
benediction
;
whereupon
the
wife
,
who
had
lately
taken
baby
from
the
cradle
,
brought
it
up
to
her
husband
and
held
it
under
his
outstretched
hands
,
to
be
blessed
in
its
sleep
.
<EOS>
For
the
moment
,
Deronda
thought
that
this
pawnbroker
,
proud
of
his
vocation
,
was
not
utterly
prosaic
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
you
found
your
welcome
in
my
family
,
I
think
,
"
said
Cohen
,
putting
down
his
hat
and
becoming
his
former
self
.
<EOS>
"
And
you
've
been
punctual
.
<EOS>
Nothing
like
a
little
stress
here
,
"
he
added
,
tapping
his
side
pocket
as
he
sat
down
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
good
for
us
all
in
our
turn
.
<EOS>
I
've
felt
it
when
I
've
had
to
make
up
payments
.
<EOS>
I
began
to
fit
every
sort
of
box
.
<EOS>
It
's
bracing
to
the
mind
.
<EOS>
Now
then
!
<EOS>
let
us
see
,
let
us
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
the
ring
I
spoke
of
,
"
said
Deronda
,
taking
it
from
his
finger
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
it
cost
a
hundred
pounds
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
a
sufficient
pledge
to
you
for
fifty
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
I
shall
probably
redeem
it
in
a
month
or
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Cohen
's
glistening
eyes
seemed
to
get
a
little
nearer
together
as
he
met
the
ingenuous
look
of
this
crude
young
gentleman
,
who
apparently
supposed
that
redemption
was
a
satisfaction
to
pawnbrokers
.
<EOS>
He
took
the
ring
,
examined
and
returned
it
,
saying
with
indifference
,
"
Good
,
good
.
<EOS>
We
'll
talk
of
it
after
our
meal
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
'll
join
us
,
if
you
've
no
objection
.
<EOS>
Me
and
my
wife'll
feel
honored
,
and
so
will
mother
;
wo
n't
you
,
mother
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
invitation
was
doubly
echoed
,
and
Deronda
gladly
accepted
it
.
<EOS>
All
now
turned
and
stood
round
the
table
.
<EOS>
No
dish
was
at
present
seen
except
one
covered
with
a
napkin
;
and
Mrs.
Cohen
had
placed
a
china
bowl
near
her
husband
that
he
might
wash
his
hands
in
it
.
<EOS>
But
after
putting
on
his
hat
again
,
he
paused
,
and
called
in
a
loud
voice
,
"
Mordecai
!
"
  
<EOS>
Can
this
be
part
of
the
religious
ceremony
?
<EOS>
thought
Deronda
,
not
knowing
what
might
be
expected
of
the
ancient
hero
.
<EOS>
But
he
heard
a
"
Yes
"
from
the
next
room
,
which
made
him
look
toward
the
open
door
;
and
there
,
to
his
astonishment
,
he
saw
the
figure
of
the
enigmatic
Jew
whom
he
had
this
morning
met
with
in
the
book
-
shop
.
<EOS>
Their
eyes
met
,
and
Mordecai
looked
as
much
surprised
as
Deronda
 
neither
in
his
surprise
making
any
sign
of
recognition
.
<EOS>
But
when
Mordecai
was
seating
himself
at
the
end
of
the
table
,
he
just
bent
his
head
to
the
guest
in
a
cold
and
distant
manner
,
as
if
the
disappointment
of
the
morning
remained
a
disagreeable
association
with
this
new
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
Cohen
now
washed
his
hands
,
pronouncing
Hebrew
words
the
while
<EOS>
:
afterward
,
he
took
off
the
napkin
covering
the
dish
and
disclosed
the
two
long
flat
loaves
besprinkled
with
seed
 
the
memorial
of
the
manna
that
fed
the
wandering
forefathers
 
and
breaking
off
small
pieces
gave
one
to
each
of
the
family
,
including
Adelaide
Rebekah
,
who
stood
on
the
chair
with
her
whole
length
exhibited
in
her
amber
-
colored
garment
,
her
little
Jewish
nose
lengthened
by
compression
of
the
lip
in
the
effort
to
make
a
suitable
appearance
.
<EOS>
Cohen
then
uttered
another
Hebrew
blessing
,
and
after
that
,
the
male
heads
were
uncovered
,
all
seated
themselves
,
and
the
meal
went
on
without
any
peculiarity
that
interested
Deronda
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
very
conscious
of
what
dishes
he
ate
from
;
being
preoccupied
with
a
desire
to
turn
the
conversation
in
a
way
that
would
enable
him
to
ask
some
leading
question
;
and
also
thinking
of
Mordecai
,
between
whom
and
himself
there
was
an
exchange
of
fascinated
,
half
furtive
glances
.
<EOS>
Mordecai
had
no
handsome
Sabbath
garment
,
but
instead
of
the
threadbare
rusty
black
coat
of
the
morning
he
wore
one
of
light
drab
,
which
looked
as
if
it
had
once
been
a
handsome
loose
paletot
now
shrunk
with
washing
;
and
this
change
of
clothing
gave
a
still
stronger
accentuation
to
his
dark
-
haired
,
eager
face
which
might
have
belonged
to
the
prophet
Ezekiel
 
also
probably
not
modish
in
the
eyes
of
contemporaries
.
<EOS>
It
was
noticeable
that
the
thin
tails
of
the
fried
fish
were
given
to
Mordecai
;
and
in
general
the
sort
of
share
assigned
to
a
poor
relation
 
no
doubt
a
"
survival
"
of
prehistoric
practice
,
not
yet
generally
admitted
to
be
superstitious
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Cohen
kept
up
the
conversation
with
much
liveliness
,
introducing
as
subjects
always
in
taste
<EOS>
(
the
Jew
is
proud
of
his
loyalty
)
<EOS>
the
Queen
and
the
Royal
Family
,
the
Emperor
and
Empress
of
the
French
 
into
which
both
grandmother
and
wife
entered
with
zest
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Cohen
the
younger
showed
an
accurate
memory
of
distinguished
birthdays
;
and
the
elder
assisted
her
son
in
informing
the
guest
of
what
occurred
when
the
Emperor
and
Empress
were
in
England
and
visited
the
city
ten
years
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
you
know
all
about
it
better
than
we
do
,
sir
,
"
said
Cohen
,
repeatedly
,
by
way
of
preface
to
full
information
;
and
the
interesting
statements
were
kept
up
in
a
trio
.
  
<EOS>
"
Our
baby
is
named
_
Eu_genie
Esther
,
"
said
young
Mrs.
Cohen
,
vivaciously
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
wonderful
how
the
Emperor
's
like
a
cousin
of
mine
in
the
face
,
"
said
the
grandmother
;
"
it
struck
me
like
lightning
when
I
caught
sight
of
him
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
have
thought
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Mother
,
and
me
went
to
see
the
Emperor
and
Empress
at
the
Crystal
Palace
,
"
said
Mr.
Cohen
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
a
fine
piece
of
work
to
take
care
of
,
mother
;
she
might
have
been
squeezed
flat
 
though
she
was
pretty
near
as
lusty
then
as
she
is
now
.
<EOS>
I
said
if
I
had
a
hundred
mothers
<EOS>
I
'd
never
take
one
of
'em
to
see
the
Emperor
and
Empress
at
the
Crystal
Palace
again
;
and
you
may
think
a
man
ca
n't
afford
it
when
he
's
got
<EOS>
but
one
mother
 
not
if
he
'd
ever
so
big
an
insurance
on
her
.
"
<EOS>
He
stroked
his
mother
's
shoulder
affectionately
,
and
chuckled
a
little
at
his
own
humor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
mother
has
been
a
widow
a
long
while
,
perhaps
,
"
said
Deronda
,
seizing
his
opportunity
.
<EOS>
"
That
has
made
your
care
for
her
the
more
needful
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
it
's
a
good
many
_
yore
-
zeit
_
since
I
had
to
manage
for
her
and
myself
,
"
said
Cohen
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
I
went
early
to
it
.
<EOS>
It
's
that
makes
you
a
sharp
knife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
does
 
what
makes
a
sharp
knife
,
father
?
"
said
Jacob
,
his
cheek
very
much
swollen
with
sweet
-
cake
.
  
<EOS>
The
father
winked
at
his
guest
and
said
,
"
Having
your
nose
put
on
the
grindstone
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jacob
slipped
from
his
chair
with
the
piece
of
sweet
-
cake
in
his
hand
,
and
going
close
up
to
Mordecai
,
who
had
been
totally
silent
hitherto
,
said
,
"
What
does
that
mean
 
putting
my
nose
to
the
grindstone
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
means
that
you
are
to
bear
being
hurt
without
making
a
noise
,
"
said
Mordecai
,
turning
his
eyes
benignantly
on
the
small
face
close
to
his
.
<EOS>
Jacob
put
the
corner
of
the
cake
into
Mordecai
's
mouth
as
an
invitation
to
bite
,
saying
meanwhile
,
"
I
sha
n't
though
,
"
and
keeping
his
eyes
on
the
cake
to
observe
how
much
of
it
went
in
this
act
of
generosity
.
<EOS>
Mordecai
took
a
bite
and
smiled
,
evidently
meaning
to
please
the
lad
,
and
the
little
incident
made
them
both
look
more
lovable
.
<EOS>
Deronda
,
however
,
felt
with
some
vexation
that
he
had
taken
little
by
his
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
fancy
that
is
the
right
quarter
for
learning
,
"
said
he
,
carrying
on
the
subject
that
he
might
have
an
excuse
for
addressing
Mordecai
,
to
whom
he
turned
and
said
,
"
You
have
been
a
great
student
,
I
imagine
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
studied
,
"
was
the
quiet
answer
.
"
<EOS>
And
you
?
 
<EOS>
You
know
German
by
the
book
you
were
buying
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
have
studied
in
Germany
.
<EOS>
Are
you
generally
engaged
in
bookselling
?
"
said
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
only
go
to
Mr.
Ram
's
shop
every
day
to
keep
it
while
he
goes
to
meals
,
"
said
Mordecai
,
who
was
now
looking
at
Deronda
with
what
seemed
a
revival
of
his
original
interest
:
<EOS>
it
seemed
as
if
the
face
had
some
attractive
indication
for
him
which
now
neutralized
the
former
disappointment
.
<EOS>
After
a
slight
pause
,
he
said
,
"
Perhaps
you
know
Hebrew
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
say
,
not
at
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mordecai
's
countenance
fell
:
he
cast
down
his
eyelids
,
looking
at
his
hands
,
which
lay
crossed
before
him
,
and
said
no
more
.
<EOS>
Deronda
had
now
noticed
more
decisively
than
in
their
former
interview
a
difficulty
in
breathing
,
which
he
thought
must
be
a
sign
of
consumption
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
had
something
else
to
do
than
to
get
book
-
learning
.
"
said
Mr.
Cohen
,
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
had
to
make
myself
knowing
about
useful
things
.
<EOS>
I
know
stones
<EOS>
well
,
"
 
here
he
pointed
to
Deronda
's
ring
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
afraid
of
taking
that
ring
of
yours
at
my
own
valuation
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
"
he
added
,
with
a
certain
drop
in
his
voice
to
a
lower
,
more
familiar
nasal
,
"
what
do
you
want
for
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Fifty
or
sixty
pounds
,
"
Deronda
answered
,
rather
too
carelessly
.
  
<EOS>
Cohen
paused
a
little
,
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
,
fixed
on
Deronda
a
pair
of
glistening
eyes
that
suggested
a
miraculous
guinea
-
pig
,
and
said
,
"
Could
n't
do
you
that
.
<EOS>
Happy
to
oblige
,
but
could
n't
go
that
lengths
.
<EOS>
Forty
pound
 
say
forty
 
<EOS>
I
'll
let
you
have
forty
on
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
was
aware
that
Mordecai
had
looked
up
again
at
the
words
implying
a
monetary
affair
,
and
was
now
examining
him
again
,
while
he
said
,
"
Very
well
,
I
shall
redeem
it
in
a
month
or
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
.
<EOS>
I
'll
make
you
out
the
ticket
by
-
and
-
by
,
"
said
Cohen
,
indifferently
.
<EOS>
Then
he
held
up
his
finger
as
a
sign
that
conversation
must
be
deferred
.
<EOS>
He
,
Mordecai
and
Jacob
put
on
their
hats
,
and
Cohen
opened
a
thanksgiving
,
which
was
carried
on
by
responses
,
till
Mordecai
delivered
himself
alone
at
some
length
,
in
a
solemn
chanting
tone
,
with
his
chin
slightly
uplifted
and
his
thin
hands
clasped
easily
before
him
.
<EOS>
Not
only
in
his
accent
and
tone
,
but
in
his
freedom
from
the
self
-
consciousness
which
has
reference
to
others
'
approbation
,
there
could
hardly
have
been
a
stronger
contrast
to
the
Jew
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
unaccountable
conjunction
 
<EOS>
the
presence
among
these
common
,
prosperous
,
shopkeeping
types
,
of
a
man
who
,
in
an
emaciated
threadbare
condition
,
imposed
a
certain
awe
on
Deronda
,
and
an
embarrassment
at
not
meeting
his
expectations
.
  
<EOS>
No
sooner
had
Mordecai
finished
his
devotional
strain
,
than
rising
,
with
a
slight
bend
of
his
head
to
the
stranger
,
he
walked
back
into
his
room
,
and
shut
the
door
behind
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
seems
to
be
rather
a
remarkable
man
,
"
said
Deronda
,
turning
to
Cohen
,
who
immediately
set
up
his
shoulders
,
put
out
his
tongue
slightly
,
and
tapped
his
own
brow
.
<EOS>
It
was
clearly
to
be
understood
that
Mordecai
did
not
come
up
to
the
standard
of
sanity
which
was
set
by
Mr.
Cohen
's
view
of
men
and
things
.
  
<EOS>
"
Does
he
belong
to
your
family
?
"
said
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
This
idea
appeared
to
be
rather
ludicrous
to
the
ladies
as
well
as
to
Cohen
,
and
the
family
interchanged
looks
of
amusement
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
Cohen
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Charity
!
<EOS>
charity
!
<EOS>
he
worked
for
me
,
and
when
he
got
weaker
and
weaker
I
took
him
in
.
<EOS>
He
's
an
incumbrance
;
but
he
brings
a
blessing
down
,
and
he
teaches
the
boy
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
he
does
the
repairing
at
the
watches
and
jewelry
.
<EOS>
"
  
Deronda
hardly
abstained
from
smiling
at
this
mixture
of
kindliness
and
the
desire
to
justify
it
in
the
light
of
a
calculation
;
but
his
willingness
to
speak
further
of
Mordecai
,
whose
character
was
made
the
more
enigmatically
striking
by
these
new
details
,
was
baffled
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cohen
immediately
dismissed
the
subject
by
reverting
to
the
"
accommodation
,
"
which
was
also
an
act
of
charity
,
and
proceeded
to
make
out
the
ticket
,
get
the
forty
pounds
,
and
present
them
both
in
exchange
for
the
diamond
ring
.
<EOS>
Deronda
,
feeling
that
it
would
be
hardly
delicate
to
protract
his
visit
beyond
the
settlement
of
the
business
which
was
its
pretext
,
had
to
take
his
leave
,
with
no
more
decided
result
than
the
advance
of
forty
pounds
and
the
pawn
-
ticket
in
his
breast
-
pocket
,
to
make
a
reason
for
returning
when
he
came
up
to
town
after
Christmas
.
<EOS>
He
was
resolved
that
he
would
then
endeavor
to
gain
a
little
more
insight
into
the
character
and
history
of
Mordecai
;
from
whom
also
he
might
gather
something
decisive
about
the
Cohens
 
for
example
,
the
reason
why
it
was
forbidden
to
ask
Mrs.
Cohen
the
elder
whether
she
had
a
daughter
.
    
<EOS>
MORDECAI
.
      
<EOS>
Were
uneasiness
of
conscience
measured
by
extent
of
crime
,
human
    
history
had
been
different
,
and
one
should
look
to
see
the
contrivers
    
of
greedy
wars
and
the
mighty
marauders
of
the
money
-
market
in
one
    
troop
of
self
-
lacerating
penitents
with
the
meaner
robber
and
    
cut
-
purse
and
the
murderer
that
doth
his
butchery
in
small
with
his
own
    
hand
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
wickedness
hath
its
rewards
to
distribute
;
but
who
so
    
wins
in
this
devil
's
game
must
needs
be
baser
,
more
cruel
,
more
brutal
    
than
the
order
of
this
planet
will
allow
for
the
multitude
born
of
    
woman
,
the
most
of
these
carrying
a
form
of
conscience
 
a
fear
which
    
is
the
shadow
of
justice
,
a
pity
which
is
the
shadow
of
love
 
<EOS>
that
    
hindereth
from
the
prize
of
serene
wickedness
,
itself
difficult
of
    
maintenance
in
our
composite
flesh
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
twenty
-
ninth
of
December
Deronda
knew
that
the
Grandcourts
had
arrived
at
the
Abbey
,
but
he
had
had
no
glimpse
of
them
before
he
went
to
dress
for
dinner
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
a
splendid
fall
of
snow
,
allowing
the
party
of
children
the
rare
pleasures
of
snow
-
balling
and
snow
-
building
,
and
in
the
Christmas
holidays
the
Mallinger
girls
were
content
with
no
amusement
unless
it
were
joined
in
and
managed
by
"
cousin
,
"
as
they
had
always
called
Deronda
.
<EOS>
After
that
outdoor
exertion
he
had
been
playing
billiards
,
and
thus
the
hours
had
passed
without
his
dwelling
at
all
on
the
prospect
of
meeting
Gwendolen
at
dinner
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
that
prospect
was
interesting
to
him
;
and
when
,
a
little
tired
and
heated
with
working
at
amusement
,
he
went
to
his
room
before
the
half
-
hour
bell
had
rung
<EOS>
,
he
began
to
think
of
it
with
some
speculation
on
the
sort
of
influence
her
marriage
with
Grandcourt
would
have
on
her
,
and
on
the
probability
that
there
would
be
some
discernible
shades
of
change
in
her
manner
since
he
saw
her
at
Diplow
,
just
as
there
had
been
since
his
first
vision
of
her
at
Leubronn
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
fancy
there
are
some
natures
one
could
see
growing
or
degenerating
every
day
,
if
one
watched
them
,
"
was
his
thought
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
some
of
us
go
on
faster
than
others
:
and
I
am
sure
she
is
a
creature
who
keeps
strong
traces
of
anything
that
has
once
impressed
her
.
<EOS>
That
little
affair
of
the
necklace
,
and
the
idea
that
somebody
thought
her
gambling
wrong
,
had
evidently
bitten
into
her
.
<EOS>
But
such
impressibility
leads
both
ways
:
it
may
drive
one
to
desperation
as
soon
as
to
anything
better
.
<EOS>
And
whatever
fascinations
Grandcourt
may
have
for
capricious
tastes
 
<EOS>
good
heavens
!
<EOS>
who
can
believe
that
he
would
call
out
the
tender
affections
in
daily
companionship
?
<EOS>
One
might
be
tempted
to
horsewhip
him
for
the
sake
of
getting
some
show
of
passion
into
his
face
and
speech
.
<EOS>
I
'm
afraid
she
married
him
out
of
ambition
 
to
escape
poverty
.
<EOS>
But
why
did
she
run
out
of
his
way
at
first
?
<EOS>
The
poverty
came
after
,
though
.
<EOS>
Poor
thing
!
<EOS>
she
may
have
been
urged
into
it
.
<EOS>
How
can
one
feel
anything
else
than
pity
for
a
young
creature
like
that
 
full
of
unused
life
 
ignorantly
rash
 
hanging
all
her
blind
expectations
on
that
remnant
of
a
human
being
.
"
  
<EOS>
Doubtless
<EOS>
the
phrases
which
Deronda
's
meditation
applied
to
the
bridegroom
were
the
less
complimentary
for
the
excuses
and
pity
in
which
it
clad
the
bride
.
<EOS>
His
notion
of
Grandcourt
as
a
"
remnant
"
was
founded
on
no
particular
knowledge
,
but
simply
on
the
impression
which
ordinary
polite
intercourse
had
given
him
that
Grandcourt
had
worn
out
all
his
natural
healthy
interest
in
things
.
  
<EOS>
In
general
,
one
may
be
sure
that
whenever
a
marriage
of
any
mark
takes
place
,
male
acquaintances
are
likely
to
pity
the
bride
,
female
acquaintances
<EOS>
the
bridegroom
:
each
,
it
is
thought
,
might
have
done
better
;
and
especially
where
the
bride
is
charming
,
young
gentlemen
on
the
scene
are
apt
to
conclude
that
she
can
have
no
real
attachment
to
a
fellow
so
uninteresting
to
themselves
as
her
husband
,
but
has
married
him
on
other
grounds
.
<EOS>
Who
,
under
such
circumstances
,
pities
the
husband
?
<EOS>
Even
his
female
friends
are
apt
to
think
his
position
retributive
:
he
should
have
chosen
some
one
else
.
<EOS>
But
perhaps
Deronda
may
be
excused
that
he
did
not
prepare
any
pity
for
Grandcourt
,
who
had
never
struck
acquaintances
as
likely
to
come
out
of
his
experiences
with
more
suffering
than
he
inflicted
;
whereas
,
for
Gwendolen
,
young
,
headlong
,
eager
for
pleasure
,
fed
with
the
flattery
which
makes
a
lovely
girl
believe
in
her
divine
right
to
rule
 
how
quickly
might
life
turn
from
expectancy
to
a
bitter
sense
of
the
irremediable
!
<EOS>
After
what
he
had
seen
of
her
he
must
have
had
rather
dull
feelings
not
to
have
looked
forward
with
some
interest
to
her
entrance
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
Still
,
since
the
honeymoon
was
already
three
weeks
in
the
distance
,
and
Gwendolen
had
been
enthroned
,
not
only
at
Ryelands
,
but
at
Diplow
,
she
was
likely
to
have
composed
her
countenance
with
suitable
manifestation
or
concealment
,
not
being
one
who
would
indulge
the
curious
by
a
helpless
exposure
of
her
feelings
.
  
<EOS>
A
various
party
had
been
invited
to
meet
the
new
couple
;
the
old
aristocracy
was
represented
by
Lord
and
Lady
Pentreath
;
the
old
gentry
by
young
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Fitzadam
of
the
Worcestershire
branch
of
the
Fitzadams
;
politics
and
the
public
good
,
as
specialized
in
the
cider
interest
,
by
Mr.
Fenn
,
member
for
West
Orchards
,
accompanied
by
his
two
daughters
;
Lady
Mallinger
's
family
,
by
her
brother
,
Mr.
Raymond
,
and
his
wife
;
the
useful
bachelor
element
by
Mr.
Sinker
,
the
eminent
counsel
,
and
by
Mr.
Vandernoodt
,
whose
acquaintance
Sir
Hugo
had
found
pleasant
enough
at
Leubronn
to
be
adopted
in
England
.
  
<EOS>
All
had
assembled
in
the
drawing
-
room
before
the
new
couple
appeared
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
time
was
being
passed
chiefly
in
noticing
the
children
 
various
little
Raymonds
,
nephews
and
nieces
of
Lady
Mallinger
's
with
her
own
three
girls
,
who
were
always
allowed
to
appear
at
this
hour
.
<EOS>
The
scene
was
really
delightful
 
<EOS>
enlarged
by
full
-
length
portraits
with
deep
backgrounds
,
inserted
in
the
cedar
paneling
 
<EOS>
surmounted
by
a
ceiling
that
glowed
with
the
rich
colors
of
the
coats
of
arms
ranged
between
the
sockets
 
illuminated
almost
as
much
by
the
red
fire
of
oak
-
boughs
as
by
the
pale
wax
-
lights
 
stilled
by
the
deep
-
piled
carpet
and
by
the
high
English
breeding
that
subdues
all
voices
;
while
the
mixture
of
ages
,
from
the
white
-
haired
Lord
and
Lady
Pentreath
to
the
four
-
year
-
old
Edgar
Raymond
,
gave
a
varied
charm
to
the
living
groups
.
<EOS>
Lady
Mallinger
,
with
fair
matronly
roundness
and
mildly
prominent
blue
eyes
,
moved
about
in
her
black
velvet
,
carrying
a
tiny
white
dog
on
her
arm
as
a
sort
of
finish
to
her
costume
;
the
children
were
scattered
among
the
ladies
,
while
most
of
the
gentlemen
were
standing
rather
aloof
,
conversing
with
that
very
moderate
vivacity
observable
during
the
long
minutes
before
dinner
.
<EOS>
Deronda
was
a
little
out
of
the
circle
in
a
dialogue
fixed
upon
him
by
Mr.
Vandernoodt
,
a
man
of
the
best
Dutch
blood
imported
at
the
revolution
:
for
the
rest
,
one
of
those
commodious
persons
in
society
who
are
nothing
particular
themselves
,
but
are
understood
to
be
acquainted
with
the
best
in
every
department
;
close
-
clipped
,
pale
-
eyed
,
_
nonchalant
_
,
as
good
a
foil
as
could
well
be
found
to
the
intense
coloring
and
vivid
gravity
of
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
talking
of
the
bride
and
bridegroom
,
whose
appearance
was
being
waited
for
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Vandernoodt
was
an
industrious
gleaner
of
personal
details
,
and
could
probably
tell
everything
about
a
great
philosopher
or
physicist
except
his
theories
or
discoveries
;
he
was
now
implying
that
he
had
learned
many
facts
about
Grandcourt
since
meeting
him
at
Leubronn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Men
who
have
seen
a
good
deal
of
life
do
n't
always
end
by
choosing
their
wives
so
well
.
<EOS>
He
has
had
rather
an
anecdotic
history
 
gone
rather
deep
into
pleasures
,
I
fancy
,
lazy
as
he
is
.
<EOS>
But
,
of
course
,
you
know
all
about
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
really
,
"
said
Deronda
,
in
an
indifferent
tone
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
little
more
of
him
than
that
he
is
Sir
Hugo
's
nephew
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
now
the
door
opened
and
deferred
any
satisfaction
of
Mr.
Vandernoodt
's
communicativeness
.
  
<EOS>
The
scene
was
one
to
set
off
any
figure
of
distinction
that
entered
on
it
,
and
certainly
when
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Grandcourt
entered
,
no
beholder
could
deny
that
their
figures
had
distinction
.
<EOS>
The
bridegroom
had
neither
more
nor
less
easy
perfection
of
costume
,
neither
more
nor
less
well
-
cut
impassibility
of
face
,
than
before
his
marriage
.
<EOS>
It
was
to
be
supposed
of
him
that
he
would
put
up
with
nothing
less
than
the
best
in
outward
equipment
,
wife
included
;
and
the
bride
was
what
he
might
have
been
expected
to
choose
.
"
<EOS>
By
George
,
I
think
she
's
handsomer
,
if
anything
!
"
said
Mr.
Vandernoodt
.
<EOS>
And
Deronda
was
of
the
same
opinion
,
but
he
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
The
white
silk
and
diamonds
 
it
may
seem
strange
,
but
she
did
wear
diamonds
on
her
neck
,
in
her
ears
,
in
her
hair
 
might
have
something
to
do
with
the
new
imposingness
of
her
beauty
,
which
flashed
on
him
as
more
unquestionable
if
not
more
thoroughly
satisfactory
than
when
he
had
first
seen
her
at
the
gaming
-
table
.
<EOS>
Some
faces
which
are
peculiar
in
their
beauty
are
like
original
works
of
art
:
for
the
first
time
they
are
almost
always
met
with
question
.
<EOS>
But
in
seeing
Gwendolen
at
Diplow
,
Deronda
had
discerned
in
her
more
than
he
had
expected
of
that
tender
appealing
charm
which
we
call
womanly
.
<EOS>
Was
there
any
new
change
since
then
?
<EOS>
He
distrusted
his
impressions
;
but
as
he
saw
her
receiving
greetings
with
what
seemed
a
proud
cold
quietude
and
a
superficial
smile
,
there
seemed
to
be
at
work
within
her
the
same
demonic
force
that
had
possessed
her
when
she
took
him
in
her
resolute
glance
and
turned
away
a
loser
from
the
gaming
-
table
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
time
for
more
of
a
conclusion
 
no
time
even
for
him
to
give
his
greeting
before
the
summons
to
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
He
sat
not
far
from
opposite
to
her
at
table
,
and
could
sometimes
hear
what
she
said
in
answer
to
Sir
Hugo
,
who
was
at
his
liveliest
in
conversation
with
her
;
but
though
he
looked
toward
her
with
the
intention
of
bowing
,
she
gave
him
no
opportunity
of
doing
so
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
At
last
Sir
Hugo
,
who
might
have
imagined
that
they
had
already
spoken
to
each
other
,
said
,
"
Deronda
,
you
will
like
to
hear
what
Mrs.
Grandcourt
tells
me
about
your
favorite
Klesmer
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
eyelids
had
been
lowered
,
and
Deronda
,
already
looking
at
her
,
thought
he
discovered
a
quivering
reluctance
as
she
was
obliged
to
raise
them
and
return
his
unembarrassed
bow
and
smile
,
her
own
smile
being
one
of
the
lip
merely
.
<EOS>
It
was
but
an
instant
,
and
Sir
Hugo
continued
without
pause
    
<EOS>
"
The
Arrowpoints
have
condoned
the
marriage
,
and
he
is
spending
the
Christmas
with
his
bride
at
Quetcham
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
will
be
glad
of
it
for
the
sake
of
his
wife
,
else
<EOS>
I
dare
say
he
would
not
have
minded
keeping
at
a
distance
,
"
said
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
sort
of
troubadour
story
,
"
said
Lady
Pentreath
,
an
easy
,
deep
-
voiced
old
lady
;
"
<EOS>
I
'm
glad
to
find
a
little
romance
left
among
us
.
<EOS>
I
think
our
young
people
now
are
getting
too
worldly
wise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
shows
the
Arrowpoints
'
good
sense
,
however
,
to
have
adopted
the
affair
,
after
the
fuss
in
the
paper
,
"
said
Sir
Hugo
.
"
<EOS>
And
disowning
your
own
child
because
of
a
_
mésalliance
_
is
something
like
disowning
your
one
eye
:
everybody
knows
it
's
yours
,
and
you
have
no
other
to
make
an
appearance
with
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
to
_
mésalliance
_
,
there
's
no
blood
on
any
side
,
"
said
Lady
Pentreath
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Old
Admiral
Arrowpoint
was
one
of
Nelson
's
men
,
you
know
 
<EOS>
a
doctor
's
son
.
<EOS>
And
we
all
know
how
the
mother
's
money
came
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
they
were
any
_
mésalliance
_
in
the
case
,
I
should
say
it
was
on
Klesmer
's
side
,
"
said
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
you
think
it
is
a
case
of
the
immortal
marrying
the
mortal
.
<EOS>
What
is
your
opinion
?
"
said
Sir
Hugo
,
looking
at
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
that
Herr
Klesmer
thinks
himself
immortal
.
<EOS>
But
I
dare
say
his
wife
will
burn
as
much
incense
before
him
as
he
requires
,
"
said
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
She
had
recovered
any
composure
that
she
might
have
lost
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
approve
of
a
wife
burning
incense
before
her
husband
?
"
said
Sir
Hugo
,
with
an
air
of
jocoseness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
"
if
it
were
only
to
make
others
believe
in
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
paused
a
moment
and
then
said
with
more
gayety
,
"
When
Herr
Klesmer
admires
his
own
genius
,
it
will
take
off
some
of
the
absurdity
if
his
wife
says
Amen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Klesmer
is
no
favorite
of
yours
,
I
see
,
"
said
Sir
Hugo
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
very
highly
of
him
,
I
assure
you
,
"
said
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
genius
is
quite
above
my
judgment
,
and
I
know
him
to
be
exceedingly
generous
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
spoke
with
the
sudden
seriousness
which
is
often
meant
to
correct
an
unfair
or
indiscreet
sally
,
having
a
bitterness
against
Klesmer
in
her
secret
soul
which
she
knew
herself
unable
to
justify
.
<EOS>
Deronda
was
wondering
what
he
should
have
thought
of
her
if
he
had
never
heard
of
her
before
:
probably
that
she
put
on
a
little
hardness
and
defiance
by
way
of
concealing
some
painful
consciousness
 
if
,
indeed
,
he
could
imagine
her
manners
otherwise
than
in
the
light
of
his
suspicion
.
<EOS>
But
why
did
she
not
recognize
him
with
more
friendliness
?
  
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
,
by
way
of
changing
the
subject
,
said
to
her
,
"
Is
not
this
a
beautiful
room
?
<EOS>
It
was
part
of
the
refectory
of
the
Abbey
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
division
made
by
those
pillars
and
the
three
arches
,
and
afterward
they
were
built
up
.
<EOS>
Else
it
was
half
as
large
again
originally
.
<EOS>
There
used
to
be
rows
of
Benedictines
sitting
where
we
are
sitting
.
<EOS>
Suppose
we
were
suddenly
to
see
the
lights
burning
low
and
the
ghosts
of
the
old
monks
rising
behind
all
our
chairs
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Please
do
n't
!
"
said
Gwendolen
,
with
a
playful
shudder
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
nice
to
come
after
ancestors
and
monks
,
but
they
should
know
their
places
and
keep
underground
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
rather
frightened
to
go
about
this
house
all
alone
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
old
generations
must
be
angry
with
us
because
we
have
altered
things
so
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
the
ghosts
must
be
of
all
political
parties
,
"
said
Sir
Hugo
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
those
fellows
who
wanted
to
change
things
while
they
lived
and
could
n't
do
it
must
be
on
our
side
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
would
not
like
to
go
over
the
house
alone
,
you
will
like
to
go
in
company
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
You
and
Grandcourt
ought
to
see
it
all
.
<EOS>
And
we
will
ask
Deronda
to
go
round
with
us
.
<EOS>
He
is
more
learned
about
it
than
I
am
.
"
<EOS>
The
baronet
was
in
the
most
complaisant
of
humors
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
stole
a
glance
at
Deronda
,
who
must
have
heard
what
Sir
Hugo
said
,
for
he
had
his
face
turned
toward
them
helping
himself
to
an
_
entrée
_
;
but
he
looked
as
impassive
as
a
picture
.
<EOS>
At
the
notion
of
Deronda
's
showing
her
and
Grandcourt
the
place
which
was
to
be
theirs
,
and
which
she
with
painful
emphasis
remembered
might
have
been
his
(
perhaps
,
if
others
had
acted
differently
)
,
certain
thoughts
had
rushed
in
 
thoughts
repeated
within
her
,
but
now
returning
on
an
occasion
embarrassingly
new
;
and
was
conscious
of
something
furtive
and
awkward
in
her
glance
which
Sir
Hugo
must
have
noticed
.
<EOS>
With
her
usual
readiness
of
resource
against
betrayal
,
she
said
,
playfully
,
"
You
do
n't
know
how
much
I
am
afraid
of
Mr.
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
's
that
?
<EOS>
Because
you
think
him
too
learned
?
"
said
Sir
Hugo
,
whom
the
peculiarity
of
her
glance
had
not
escaped
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
It
is
ever
since
I
first
saw
him
at
Leubronn
.
<EOS>
Because
when
he
came
to
look
on
at
the
roulette
-
table
,
I
began
to
lose
.
<EOS>
He
cast
an
evil
eye
on
my
play
.
<EOS>
He
did
n't
approve
it
.
<EOS>
He
has
told
me
so
.
<EOS>
And
now
whatever
I
do
before
him
,
I
am
afraid
he
will
cast
an
evil
eye
upon
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Gad
!
<EOS>
I
'm
rather
afraid
of
him
myself
when
he
does
n't
approve
,
"
said
Sir
Hugo
,
glancing
at
Deronda
;
and
then
turning
his
face
toward
Gwendolen
<EOS>
,
he
said
less
audibly
,
"
I
do
n't
think
ladies
generally
object
to
have
his
eyes
upon
them
.
"
<EOS>
The
baronet
's
small
chronic
complaint
of
facetiousness
was
at
this
moment
almost
as
annoying
to
Gwendolen
as
it
often
was
to
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
object
to
any
eyes
that
are
critical
,
"
she
said
,
in
a
cool
,
high
voice
,
with
a
turn
of
her
neck
.
"
<EOS>
Are
there
many
of
these
old
rooms
left
in
the
Abbey
?
"
  
"
Not
many
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
fine
cloistered
court
with
a
long
gallery
above
it
.
<EOS>
But
the
finest
bit
of
all
is
turned
into
stables
.
<EOS>
It
is
part
of
the
old
church
.
<EOS>
When
I
improved
the
place
I
made
the
most
of
every
other
bit
;
but
it
was
out
of
my
reach
to
change
the
stables
,
so
the
horses
have
the
benefit
of
the
fine
old
choir
.
<EOS>
You
must
go
and
see
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
like
to
see
the
horses
as
well
as
the
building
,
"
said
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
have
no
stud
to
speak
of
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
will
look
with
contempt
at
my
horses
,
"
said
Sir
Hugo
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
given
up
hunting
,
and
go
on
in
a
jog
-
trot
way
,
as
becomes
an
old
gentlemen
with
daughters
.
<EOS>
The
fact
is
,
I
went
in
for
doing
too
much
at
this
place
.
<EOS>
We
all
lived
at
Diplow
for
two
years
while
the
alterations
were
going
on
:
Do
you
like
Diplow
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
particularly
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
with
indifference
.
<EOS>
One
would
have
thought
that
the
young
lady
had
all
her
life
had
more
family
seats
than
she
cared
to
go
to
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
it
will
not
do
after
Ryelands
,
"
said
Sir
Hugo
,
well
pleased
.
<EOS>
"
Grandcourt
,
I
know
,
took
it
for
the
sake
of
the
hunting
.
<EOS>
But
he
found
something
so
much
better
there
,
"
added
the
baronet
,
lowering
his
voice
,
"
that
he
might
well
prefer
it
to
any
other
place
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
has
one
attraction
for
me
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
passing
over
this
compliment
with
a
chill
smile
,
"
that
it
is
within
reach
of
Offendene
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
that
,
"
said
Sir
Hugo
,
and
then
let
the
subject
drop
.
  
<EOS>
What
amiable
baronet
can
escape
the
effect
of
a
strong
desire
for
a
particular
possession
?
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
would
have
been
glad
that
Grandcourt
,
with
or
without
reason
,
should
prefer
any
other
place
to
Diplow
;
but
inasmuch
as
in
the
pure
process
of
wishing
<EOS>
we
can
always
make
the
conditions
of
our
gratification
benevolent
,
he
did
wish
that
Grandcourt
's
convenient
disgust
for
Diplow
should
not
be
associated
with
his
marriage
with
this
very
charming
bride
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
was
much
to
the
baronet
's
taste
,
but
,
as
he
observed
afterward
to
Lady
Mallinger
,
he
should
never
have
taken
her
for
a
young
girl
who
had
married
beyond
her
expectations
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
had
not
heard
much
of
this
conversation
,
having
given
his
attention
elsewhere
,
but
the
glimpses
he
had
of
Gwendolen
's
manner
deepened
the
impression
that
it
had
something
newly
artificial
.
  
<EOS>
Later
,
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
Deronda
,
at
somebody
's
request
,
sat
down
to
the
piano
and
sang
.
<EOS>
Afterward
,
Mrs.
Raymond
took
his
place
;
and
on
rising
he
observed
that
Gwendolen
had
left
her
seat
,
and
had
come
to
this
end
of
the
room
,
as
if
to
listen
more
fully
,
but
was
now
standing
with
her
back
to
every
one
,
apparently
contemplating
a
fine
cowled
head
carved
in
ivory
which
hung
over
a
small
table
.
<EOS>
He
longed
to
go
to
her
and
speak
.
<EOS>
Why
should
he
not
obey
such
an
impulse
,
as
he
would
have
done
toward
any
other
lady
in
the
room
?
<EOS>
Yet
he
hesitated
some
moments
,
observing
the
graceful
lines
of
her
back
,
but
not
moving
.
  
<EOS>
If
you
have
any
reason
for
not
indulging
a
wish
to
speak
to
a
fair
woman
,
it
is
a
bad
plan
to
look
long
at
her
back
:
the
wish
to
see
what
it
screens
becomes
the
stronger
.
<EOS>
There
may
be
a
very
sweet
smile
on
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
Deronda
ended
by
going
to
the
end
of
the
small
table
,
at
right
angles
to
Gwendolen
's
position
,
but
before
he
could
speak
she
had
turned
on
him
no
smile
,
but
such
an
appealing
look
of
sadness
,
so
utterly
different
from
the
chill
effort
of
her
recognition
at
table
,
that
his
speech
was
checked
.
<EOS>
For
what
was
an
appreciative
space
of
time
to
both
,
though
the
observation
of
others
could
not
have
measured
it
,
they
looked
at
each
other
 
she
seeming
to
take
the
deep
rest
of
confession
,
<EOS>
he
with
an
answering
depth
of
sympathy
that
neutralized
all
other
feelings
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
not
join
in
the
music
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
by
way
of
meeting
the
necessity
for
speech
.
  
<EOS>
That
her
look
of
confession
had
been
involuntary
was
shown
by
that
just
perceptible
shake
and
change
of
countenance
with
which
she
roused
herself
to
reply
calmly
,
"
I
join
in
it
by
listening
.
<EOS>
I
am
fond
of
music
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
not
a
musician
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
given
a
great
deal
of
time
to
music
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
not
talent
enough
to
make
it
worth
while
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
sing
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
you
are
fond
of
music
,
it
will
always
be
worth
while
in
private
,
for
your
own
delight
.
<EOS>
I
make
it
a
virtue
to
be
content
with
my
middlingness
,
"
said
Deronda
,
smiling
;
"
it
is
always
pardonable
,
so
that
one
does
not
ask
others
to
take
it
for
superiority
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
imitate
you
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
recovering
her
tone
of
artificial
vivacity
.
<EOS>
"
To
be
middling
with
me
is
another
phrase
for
being
dull
.
<EOS>
And
the
worst
fault
I
have
to
find
with
the
world
is
,
that
it
is
dull
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
,
I
am
going
to
justify
gambling
in
spite
of
you
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
refuge
from
dullness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
admit
the
justification
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
what
we
call
the
dullness
of
things
is
a
disease
in
ourselves
.
<EOS>
Else
how
can
any
one
find
an
intense
interest
in
life
?
<EOS>
And
many
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
I
see
!
<EOS>
The
fault
I
find
in
the
world
is
my
own
fault
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
smiling
at
him
.
<EOS>
Then
after
a
moment
,
looking
up
at
the
ivory
again
,
she
said
,
"
Do
_
you
_
never
find
fault
with
the
world
or
with
others
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
.
<EOS>
When
I
am
in
a
grumbling
mood
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
hate
people
?
<EOS>
Confess
you
hate
them
when
they
stand
in
your
way
 
when
their
gain
is
your
loss
?
<EOS>
That
is
your
own
phrase
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
often
standing
in
each
other
's
way
when
we
ca
n't
help
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
is
stupid
to
hate
people
on
that
ground
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
they
injure
you
and
could
have
helped
it
?
"
said
Gwendolen
with
a
hard
intensity
unaccountable
in
incidental
talk
like
this
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
wondered
at
her
choice
of
subjects
.
<EOS>
A
painful
impression
arrested
his
answer
a
moment
,
but
at
last
he
said
,
with
a
graver
,
deeper
intonation
,
"
Why
,
then
,
after
all
,
I
prefer
my
place
to
theirs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
I
believe
you
are
right
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
with
a
sudden
little
laugh
,
and
turned
to
join
the
group
at
the
piano
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
looked
around
for
Grandcourt
,
wondering
whether
he
followed
his
bride
's
movements
with
any
attention
;
but
it
was
rather
undiscerning
to
him
to
suppose
that
he
could
find
out
the
fact
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
had
a
delusive
mood
of
observing
whatever
had
an
interest
for
him
,
which
could
be
surpassed
by
no
sleepy
-
eyed
animal
on
the
watch
for
prey
.
<EOS>
At
that
moment
he
was
plunged
in
the
depth
of
an
easy
chair
,
being
talked
to
by
Mr.
Vandernoodt
,
who
apparently
thought
the
acquaintance
of
such
a
bridegroom
worth
cultivating
;
and
an
incautious
person
might
have
supposed
it
safe
to
telegraph
secrets
in
front
of
him
,
the
common
prejudice
being
that
your
quick
observer
is
one
whose
eyes
have
quick
movements
.
<EOS>
Not
at
all
.
<EOS>
If
you
want
a
respectable
witness
who
will
see
nothing
inconvenient
,
choose
a
vivacious
gentleman
,
very
much
on
the
alert
,
with
two
eyes
wide
open
,
a
glass
in
one
of
them
,
and
an
entire
impartiality
as
to
the
purpose
of
looking
.
<EOS>
If
Grandcourt
cared
to
keep
any
one
under
his
power
he
saw
them
out
of
the
corners
of
his
long
narrow
eyes
,
and
if
they
went
behind
him
he
had
a
constructive
process
by
which
he
knew
what
they
were
doing
there
.
<EOS>
He
knew
perfectly
well
where
his
wife
was
,
and
how
she
was
behaving
.
<EOS>
Was
he
going
to
be
a
jealous
husband
?
<EOS>
Deronda
imagined
that
to
be
likely
;
but
his
imagination
was
as
much
astray
about
Grandcourt
as
it
would
have
been
about
an
unexplored
continent
where
all
the
species
were
peculiar
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
conceive
that
he
himself
was
a
likely
subject
of
jealousy
,
or
that
he
should
give
any
pretext
for
it
;
but
the
suspicion
that
a
wife
is
not
happy
naturally
leads
one
to
speculate
on
the
husband
's
private
deportment
;
and
Deronda
found
himself
after
one
o'clock
in
the
morning
in
the
rather
ludicrous
position
of
sitting
up
severely
holding
a
Hebrew
grammar
in
his
hands
(
for
somehow
,
in
deference
to
Mordecai
,
he
had
begun
to
study
Hebrew
)
,
with
the
consciousness
that
he
had
been
in
that
attitude
nearly
an
hour
,
and
had
thought
of
nothing
but
Gwendolen
and
her
husband
.
<EOS>
To
be
an
unusual
young
man
means
for
the
most
part
to
get
a
difficult
mastery
over
the
usual
,
which
is
often
like
the
sprite
of
ill
-
luck
you
pack
up
your
goods
to
escape
from
,
and
see
grinning
at
you
from
the
top
of
your
luggage
van
.
<EOS>
The
peculiarities
of
Deronda
's
nature
had
been
acutely
touched
by
the
brief
incident
and
words
which
made
the
history
of
his
intercourse
with
Gwendolen
;
and
this
evening
's
slight
addition
had
given
them
an
importunate
recurrence
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
vanity
 
<EOS>
it
was
ready
sympathy
that
had
made
him
alive
to
a
certain
appealingness
in
her
behavior
toward
him
;
and
the
difficulty
with
which
she
had
seemed
to
raise
her
eyes
to
bow
to
him
,
in
the
first
instance
,
was
to
be
interpreted
now
by
that
unmistakable
look
of
involuntary
confidence
which
she
had
afterward
turned
on
him
under
the
consciousness
of
his
approach
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
use
of
it
all
?
"
thought
Deronda
,
as
he
threw
down
his
grammar
,
and
began
to
undress
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
do
anything
to
help
her
 
nobody
can
,
if
she
has
found
out
her
mistake
already
.
<EOS>
And
it
seems
to
me
that
she
has
a
dreary
lack
of
the
ideas
that
might
help
her
.
<EOS>
Strange
and
piteous
to
human
flesh
like
that
might
be
,
wrapped
round
with
fine
raiment
,
her
ears
pierced
for
gems
,
her
head
held
loftily
,
her
mouth
all
smiling
pretence
,
the
poor
soul
within
her
sitting
in
sick
distaste
of
all
things
!
<EOS>
But
what
do
I
know
of
her
?
<EOS>
There
may
be
a
demon
in
her
to
match
the
worst
husband
,
for
what
I
can
tell
.
<EOS>
She
was
clearly
an
ill
-
educated
,
worldly
girl
:
perhaps
she
is
a
coquette
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
last
reflection
,
not
much
believed
in
,
was
a
self
-
administered
dose
of
caution
,
prompted
partly
by
Sir
Hugo
's
much
-
contemned
joking
on
the
subject
of
flirtation
.
<EOS>
Deronda
resolved
not
to
volunteer
any
_
tete
-
à
-
tete
_
with
Gwendolen
during
the
days
of
her
stay
at
the
Abbey
;
and
he
was
capable
of
keeping
a
resolve
in
spite
of
much
inclination
to
the
contrary
.
  
<EOS>
But
a
man
can
not
resolve
about
a
woman
's
actions
,
least
of
all
about
those
of
a
woman
like
Gwendolen
,
in
whose
nature
there
was
a
combination
of
proud
reserve
with
rashness
,
of
perilously
poised
terror
with
defiance
,
which
might
alternately
flatter
and
disappoint
control
.
<EOS>
Few
words
could
less
represent
her
than
"
coquette
.
"
<EOS>
She
had
native
love
of
homage
,
and
belief
in
her
own
power
;
but
no
cold
artifice
for
the
sake
of
enslaving
.
<EOS>
And
the
poor
thing
's
belief
in
her
power
,
with
her
other
dreams
before
marriage
,
had
often
to
be
thrust
aside
now
like
the
toys
of
a
sick
child
,
which
it
looks
at
with
dull
eyes
,
and
has
no
heart
to
play
with
,
however
it
may
try
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
day
at
lunch
Sir
Hugo
said
to
her
,
"
The
thaw
has
gone
on
like
magic
,
and
it
's
so
pleasant
out
of
doors
just
now
 
<EOS>
shall
we
go
and
see
the
stables
and
the
other
odd
bits
about
the
place
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
pray
,
"
said
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
like
to
see
the
stables
,
Henleigh
?
"
<EOS>
she
added
,
looking
at
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
Uncommonly
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
with
an
indifference
which
seemed
to
give
irony
to
the
word
,
as
he
returned
her
look
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
first
time
Deronda
had
seen
them
speak
to
each
other
since
their
arrival
,
and
he
thought
their
exchange
of
looks
as
cold
or
official
as
if
it
had
been
a
ceremony
to
keep
up
a
charter
.
<EOS>
Still
,
the
English
fondness
for
reserve
will
account
for
much
negation
;
and
Grandcourt
's
manners
with
an
extra
veil
of
reserve
over
them
might
be
expected
to
present
the
extreme
type
of
the
national
taste
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
else
is
inclined
to
make
the
tour
of
the
house
and
premises
?
"
said
Sir
Hugo
.
<EOS>
"
The
ladies
must
muffle
themselves
;
there
is
only
just
about
time
to
do
it
well
before
sunset
.
<EOS>
You
will
go
,
Dan
,
wo
n't
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
"
said
Deronda
,
carelessly
,
knowing
that
Sir
Hugo
would
think
any
excuse
disobliging
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
meet
in
the
library
,
then
,
when
they
are
ready
 
say
in
half
an
hour
,
"
said
the
baronet
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
made
herself
ready
with
wonderful
quickness
,
and
in
ten
minutes
came
down
into
the
library
in
her
sables
,
plume
,
and
little
thick
boots
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
she
entered
the
room
she
was
aware
that
some
one
else
was
there
:
it
was
precisely
what
she
had
hoped
for
.
<EOS>
Deronda
was
standing
with
his
back
toward
her
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
,
and
was
looking
over
a
newspaper
.
<EOS>
How
could
little
thick
boots
make
any
noise
on
an
Axminster
carpet
?
<EOS>
And
to
cough
would
have
seemed
an
intended
signaling
which
her
pride
could
not
condescend
to
;
also
,
she
felt
bashful
about
walking
up
to
him
and
letting
him
know
that
she
was
there
,
though
it
was
her
hunger
to
speak
to
him
which
had
set
her
imagination
on
constructing
this
chance
of
finding
him
,
and
had
made
her
hurry
down
,
as
birds
hover
near
the
water
which
they
dare
not
drink
.
<EOS>
Always
uneasily
dubious
about
his
opinion
of
her
,
she
felt
a
peculiar
anxiety
to
-
day
,
lest
he
might
think
of
her
with
contempt
,
as
one
triumphantly
conscious
of
being
Grandcourt
's
wife
,
the
future
lady
of
this
domain
.
<EOS>
It
was
her
habitual
effort
now
to
magnify
the
satisfactions
of
her
pride
,
on
which
she
nourished
her
strength
;
but
somehow
Deronda
's
being
there
disturbed
them
all
.
<EOS>
There
was
not
the
faintest
touch
of
coquetry
in
the
attitude
of
her
mind
toward
him
:
he
was
unique
to
her
among
men
,
because
he
had
impressed
her
as
being
not
her
admirer
but
her
superior
:
in
some
mysterious
way
he
was
becoming
a
part
of
her
conscience
,
as
one
woman
whose
nature
is
an
object
of
reverential
belief
may
become
a
new
conscience
to
a
man
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
he
would
not
look
round
and
find
out
that
she
was
there
!
<EOS>
The
paper
crackled
in
his
hand
,
his
head
rose
and
sank
,
exploring
those
stupid
columns
,
and
he
was
evidently
stroking
his
beard
;
as
if
this
world
were
a
very
easy
affair
to
her
.
<EOS>
Of
course
all
the
rest
of
the
company
would
soon
be
down
,
and
the
opportunity
of
her
saying
something
to
efface
her
flippancy
of
the
evening
before
,
would
be
quite
gone
.
<EOS>
She
felt
sick
with
irritation
 
<EOS>
so
fast
do
young
creatures
like
her
absorb
misery
through
invisible
suckers
of
their
own
fancies
 
and
her
face
had
gathered
that
peculiar
expression
which
comes
with
a
mortification
to
which
tears
are
forbidden
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
he
threw
down
the
paper
and
turned
round
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
are
there
already
,
"
he
said
,
coming
forward
a
step
or
two
:
"
I
must
go
and
put
on
my
coat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
turned
aside
and
walked
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
This
was
behaving
quite
badly
.
<EOS>
Mere
politeness
would
have
made
him
stay
to
exchange
some
words
before
leaving
her
alone
.
<EOS>
It
was
true
that
Grandcourt
came
in
with
Sir
Hugo
immediately
after
,
so
that
the
words
must
have
been
too
few
to
be
worth
anything
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
they
saw
him
walking
from
the
library
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
 
you
look
rather
ill
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
going
straight
up
to
her
,
standing
in
front
of
her
,
and
looking
into
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
feel
equal
to
the
walk
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
shall
like
it
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
without
the
slightest
movement
except
this
of
the
lips
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
could
put
off
going
over
the
house
,
you
know
,
and
only
go
out
of
doors
,
"
said
Sir
Hugo
,
kindly
,
while
Grandcourt
turned
aside
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear
no
!
<EOS>
"
said
Gwendolen
,
speaking
with
determination
;
"
let
us
put
off
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
want
a
long
walk
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
walking
party
 
two
ladies
and
two
gentlemen
besides
Deronda
 
had
now
assembled
;
and
Gwendolen
rallying
,
went
with
due
cheerfulness
by
the
side
of
Sir
Hugo
,
paying
apparently
an
equal
attention
to
the
commentaries
Deronda
was
called
upon
to
give
on
the
various
architectural
fragments
,
to
Sir
Hugo
's
reasons
for
not
attempting
to
remedy
the
mixture
of
the
undisguised
modern
with
the
antique
 
which
in
his
opinion
only
made
the
place
the
more
truly
historical
.
<EOS>
On
their
way
to
the
buttery
<EOS>
and
kitchen
they
took
the
outside
of
the
house
and
paused
before
a
beautiful
pointed
doorway
,
which
was
the
only
old
remnant
in
the
east
front
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
now
,
to
my
mind
,
"
said
Sir
Hugo
,
"
that
is
more
interesting
standing
as
it
is
in
the
middle
of
what
is
frankly
four
centuries
later
,
than
if
the
whole
front
had
been
dressed
up
in
a
pretense
of
the
thirteenth
century
.
<EOS>
Additions
ought
to
smack
of
the
time
when
they
are
made
and
carry
the
stamp
of
their
period
.
<EOS>
I
would
n't
destroy
any
old
bits
,
but
that
notion
of
reproducing
the
old
is
a
mistake
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
At
least
,
if
a
man
likes
to
do
it
he
must
pay
for
his
whistle
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
where
are
you
to
stop
along
that
road
 
making
loopholes
where
you
do
n't
want
to
peep
,
and
so
on
?
<EOS>
You
may
as
well
ask
me
to
wear
out
the
stones
with
kneeling
;
eh
,
Grandcourt
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
A
confounded
nuisance
,
"
drawled
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
"
I
hate
fellows
wanting
to
howl
litanies
 
<EOS>
acting
the
greatest
bores
that
have
ever
existed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
yes
,
that
's
what
their
romanticism
must
come
to
,
"
said
Sir
Hugo
,
in
a
tone
of
confidential
assent
 
"
that
is
if
they
carry
it
out
logically
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
that
way
of
arguing
against
a
course
because
it
may
be
ridden
down
to
an
absurdity
would
soon
bring
life
to
a
standstill
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
the
logic
of
human
action
,
but
of
a
roasting
-
jack
,
that
must
go
on
to
the
last
turn
when
it
has
been
once
wound
up
.
<EOS>
We
can
do
nothing
safely
without
some
judgment
as
to
where
we
are
to
stop
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
find
the
rule
of
the
pocket
the
best
guide
,
"
said
Sir
Hugo
,
laughingly
.
"
<EOS>
And
as
for
most
of
your
new
-
old
building
,
you
had
need
to
hire
men
to
scratch
and
chip
it
all
over
artistically
to
give
it
an
elderly
-
looking
surface
;
which
at
the
present
rate
of
labor
would
not
answer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
want
to
keep
up
the
old
fashions
,
then
,
Mr.
Deronda
?
"
said
Gwendolen
,
taking
advantage
of
the
freedom
of
grouping
to
fall
back
a
little
,
while
Sir
Hugo
and
Grandcourt
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
Some
of
them
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
see
why
we
should
not
use
our
choice
there
as
we
do
elsewhere
 
or
why
either
age
or
novelty
by
itself
is
an
argument
for
or
against
.
<EOS>
To
delight
in
doing
things
because
our
fathers
did
them
is
good
if
it
shuts
out
nothing
better
;
it
enlarges
the
range
of
affection
 
and
affection
is
the
broadest
basis
of
good
in
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
so
?
"
said
Gwendolen
with
a
little
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
thought
you
cared
most
about
ideas
,
knowledge
,
wisdom
,
and
all
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
to
care
about
_
them
_
is
a
sort
of
affection
,
"
said
Deronda
,
smiling
at
her
sudden
_
naïveté
_
.
<EOS>
"
Call
it
attachment
;
interest
,
willing
to
bear
a
great
deal
for
the
sake
of
being
with
them
and
saving
them
from
injury
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
it
makes
a
difference
if
the
objects
of
interest
are
human
beings
;
but
generally
in
all
deep
affections
the
objects
are
a
mixture
 
half
persons
and
half
ideas
 
sentiments
and
affections
flow
in
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
I
understand
that
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
putting
up
her
chin
in
her
old
saucy
manner
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
I
am
not
very
affectionate
;
perhaps
you
mean
to
tell
me
,
that
is
the
reason
why
I
do
n't
see
much
good
in
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
did
_
<EOS>
not
_
mean
to
tell
you
that
;
but
I
admit
that
I
should
think
it
true
if
I
believed
what
you
say
of
yourself
,
"
said
Deronda
,
gravely
.
  
<EOS>
Here
Sir
Hugo
and
Grandcourt
turned
round
and
paused
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
can
get
Mr.
Deronda
to
pay
me
a
compliment
,
"
said
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
quite
a
curiosity
to
see
whether
a
little
flattery
can
be
extracted
from
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
Sir
Hugo
,
glancing
at
Deronda
,
"
the
fact
is
,
it
is
useless
to
flatter
a
bride
.
<EOS>
We
give
it
up
in
despair
.
<EOS>
She
has
been
so
fed
on
sweet
speeches
that
every
thing
we
say
seems
tasteless
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
true
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
bending
her
head
and
smiling
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Grandcourt
won
me
by
neatly
-
turned
compliments
.
<EOS>
If
there
had
been
one
word
out
of
place
it
would
have
been
fatal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
hear
that
?
"
said
Sir
Hugo
,
looking
at
the
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
without
change
of
countenance
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
deucedly
hard
thing
to
keep
up
,
though
.
"
  
<EOS>
All
this
seemed
to
Sir
Hugo
a
natural
playfulness
between
such
a
husband
and
wife
;
but
Deronda
wondered
at
the
misleading
alternations
in
Gwendolen
's
manner
,
which
at
one
moment
seemed
to
excite
sympathy
by
childlike
indiscretion
,
at
another
to
repel
it
by
proud
concealment
.
<EOS>
He
tried
to
keep
out
of
her
way
by
devoting
himself
to
Miss
Juliet
Fenn
,
a
young
lady
whose
profile
had
been
so
unfavorably
decided
by
circumstances
over
which
she
had
no
control
,
that
Gwendolen
some
months
ago
had
felt
it
impossible
to
be
jealous
of
her
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
when
they
were
seeing
the
kitchen
 
a
part
of
the
original
building
in
perfect
preservation
 
the
depth
of
shadow
in
the
niches
of
the
stone
-
walls
and
groined
vault
,
the
play
of
light
from
the
huge
glowing
fire
on
polished
tin
,
brass
,
and
copper
,
the
fine
resonance
that
came
with
every
sound
of
voice
or
metal
,
were
all
spoiled
for
Gwendolen
,
and
Sir
Hugo
's
speech
about
them
was
made
rather
importunate
,
because
Deronda
was
discoursing
to
the
other
ladies
and
kept
at
a
distance
from
her
.
<EOS>
It
did
not
signify
that
the
other
gentlemen
took
the
opportunity
of
being
near
her
:
of
what
use
in
the
world
was
their
admiration
while
she
had
an
uneasy
sense
that
there
was
some
standard
in
Deronda
's
mind
which
measured
her
into
littleness
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Vandernoodt
,
who
had
the
mania
of
always
describing
one
thing
while
you
were
looking
at
another
,
was
quite
intolerable
with
his
insistence
on
Lord
Blough
's
kitchen
,
which
he
had
seen
in
the
north
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
n't
ask
us
to
see
two
kitchens
at
once
.
<EOS>
It
makes
the
heat
double
.
<EOS>
I
must
really
go
out
of
it
,
"
she
cried
at
last
,
marching
resolutely
into
the
open
air
,
and
leaving
the
others
in
the
rear
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
was
already
out
,
and
as
she
joined
him
,
he
said
    
"
I
wondered
how
long
you
meant
to
stay
in
that
damned
place
"
 
one
of
the
freedoms
he
had
assumed
as
a
husband
being
the
use
of
his
strongest
epithets
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
turning
to
see
the
rest
of
the
party
approach
,
said
    
"
It
was
certainly
rather
too
warm
in
one
's
wraps
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
walked
on
the
gravel
across
a
green
court
,
where
the
snow
still
lay
in
islets
on
the
grass
,
and
in
masses
on
the
boughs
of
the
great
cedar
and
the
crenelated
coping
of
the
stone
walls
,
and
then
into
a
larger
court
,
where
there
was
another
cedar
,
to
find
the
beautiful
choir
long
ago
turned
into
stables
,
in
the
first
instance
perhaps
after
an
impromptu
fashion
by
troopers
,
who
had
a
pious
satisfaction
in
insulting
the
priests
of
Baal
and
the
images
of
Ashtoreth
,
the
queen
of
heaven
.
<EOS>
The
exterior
 
its
west
end
,
save
for
the
stable
door
,
walled
in
with
brick
and
covered
with
ivy
 
was
much
defaced
,
maimed
of
finial
and
gurgoyle
,
the
friable
limestone
broken
and
fretted
,
and
lending
its
soft
gray
to
a
powdery
dark
lichen
;
the
long
windows
,
too
,
were
filled
in
with
brick
as
far
as
the
springing
of
the
arches
,
the
broad
clerestory
windows
with
wire
or
ventilating
blinds
.
<EOS>
With
the
low
wintry
afternoon
sun
upon
it
,
sending
shadows
from
the
cedar
boughs
,
and
lighting
up
the
touches
of
snow
remaining
on
every
ledge
,
it
had
still
a
scarcely
disturbed
aspect
of
antique
solemnity
,
which
gave
the
scene
in
the
interior
rather
a
startling
effect
;
though
,
ecclesiastical
or
reverential
indignation
apart
,
the
eyes
could
hardly
help
dwelling
with
pleasure
on
its
piquant
picturesqueness
.
<EOS>
Each
finely
-
arched
chapel
was
turned
into
a
stall
,
where
in
the
dusty
glazing
of
the
windows
there
still
gleamed
patches
of
crimson
,
orange
,
blue
,
and
palest
violet
;
for
the
rest
,
the
choir
had
been
gutted
,
the
floor
leveled
,
paved
,
and
drained
according
to
the
most
approved
fashion
,
and
a
line
of
loose
boxes
erected
in
the
middle
:
<EOS>
a
soft
light
fell
from
the
upper
windows
on
sleek
brown
or
gray
flanks
and
haunches
;
on
mild
equine
faces
looking
out
with
active
nostrils
over
the
varnished
brown
boarding
;
on
the
hay
hanging
from
racks
where
the
saints
once
looked
down
from
the
altar
-
pieces
,
and
on
the
pale
golden
straw
scattered
or
in
heaps
;
on
a
little
white
-
and
-
liver
-
colored
spaniel
making
his
bed
on
the
back
of
an
elderly
hackney
,
and
on
four
ancient
angels
,
still
showing
signs
of
devotion
like
mutilated
martyrs
 
while
over
all
,
the
grand
pointed
roof
,
untouched
by
reforming
wash
,
showed
its
lines
and
colors
mysteriously
through
veiling
shadow
and
cobweb
,
and
a
hoof
now
and
then
striking
against
the
boards
seemed
to
fill
the
vault
with
thunder
,
while
outside
there
was
the
answering
bay
of
the
blood
-
hounds
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
this
is
glorious
!
"
<EOS>
Gwendolen
burst
forth
,
in
forgetfulness
of
everything
<EOS>
but
the
immediate
impression
:
there
had
been
a
little
intoxication
for
her
in
the
grand
spaces
of
courts
and
building
,
and
the
fact
of
her
being
an
important
person
among
them
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
_
is
_
glorious
!
<EOS>
Only
I
wish
there
were
a
horse
in
every
one
of
the
boxes
.
<EOS>
I
would
ten
times
rather
have
these
stables
than
those
at
Diplow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
she
had
no
sooner
said
this
than
some
consciousness
arrested
her
,
and
involuntarily
she
turned
her
eyes
toward
Deronda
,
who
oddly
enough
had
taken
off
his
felt
hat
and
stood
holding
it
before
him
as
if
they
had
entered
a
room
or
an
actual
church
.
<EOS>
He
,
like
others
,
happened
to
be
looking
at
her
,
and
their
eyes
met
 
to
her
intense
vexation
,
for
it
seemed
to
her
that
by
looking
at
him
she
had
betrayed
the
reference
of
her
thoughts
,
and
she
felt
herself
blushing
<EOS>
:
she
exaggerated
the
impression
that
even
Sir
Hugo
as
well
as
Deronda
would
have
of
her
bad
taste
in
referring
to
the
possession
of
anything
at
the
Abbey
:
<EOS>
as
for
Deronda
,
she
had
probably
made
him
despise
her
.
<EOS>
Her
annoyance
at
what
she
imagined
to
be
the
obviousness
of
her
confusion
robbed
her
of
her
usual
facility
in
carrying
it
off
by
playful
speech
,
and
turning
up
her
face
to
look
at
the
roof
,
she
wheeled
away
in
that
attitude
.
<EOS>
If
any
had
noticed
her
blush
as
significant
,
they
had
certainly
not
interpreted
it
by
the
secret
windings
and
recesses
of
her
feeling
.
<EOS>
A
blush
is
no
language
:
only
a
dubious
flag
-
signal
which
may
mean
either
of
two
contradictories
.
<EOS>
Deronda
alone
had
a
faint
guess
at
some
part
of
her
feeling
;
but
while
he
was
observing
her
he
was
himself
under
observation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
take
off
your
hat
to
horses
?
<EOS>
"
said
Grandcourt
,
with
a
slight
sneer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
said
Deronda
,
covering
himself
.
<EOS>
He
had
really
taken
off
the
hat
automatically
,
and
if
he
had
been
an
ugly
man
might
doubtless
have
done
so
with
impunity
;
ugliness
having
naturally
the
air
of
involuntary
exposure
,
and
beauty
,
of
display
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
confusion
was
soon
merged
in
the
survey
of
the
horses
,
which
Grandcourt
politely
abstained
from
appraising
,
languidly
assenting
to
Sir
Hugo
's
alternate
depreciation
and
eulogy
of
the
same
animal
,
as
one
that
he
should
not
have
bought
when
he
was
younger
,
and
piqued
himself
on
his
horses
,
but
yet
one
that
had
better
qualities
than
many
more
expensive
brutes
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
fact
is
,
stables
dive
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
pocket
nowadays
,
and
I
am
very
glad
to
have
got
rid
of
that
_
démangeaison
_
,
"
said
Sir
Hugo
,
as
they
were
coming
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
a
man
to
do
,
though
?
"
said
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
"
He
must
ride
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
see
what
else
there
is
to
do
.
<EOS>
And
I
do
n't
call
it
riding
to
sit
astride
a
set
of
brutes
with
every
deformity
under
the
sun
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
delicate
diplomatic
way
of
characterizing
Sir
Hugo
's
stud
did
not
require
direct
notice
;
and
the
baronet
,
feeling
that
the
conversation
had
worn
rather
thin
,
said
to
the
party
generally
,
"
Now
we
are
going
to
see
the
cloister
 
<EOS>
the
finest
bit
of
all
 
in
perfect
preservation
;
the
monks
might
have
been
walking
there
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
Gwendolen
had
lingered
behind
to
look
at
the
kenneled
blood
-
hounds
,
perhaps
because
she
felt
a
little
dispirited
;
and
Grandcourt
waited
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
take
my
arm
,
"
he
said
,
in
his
low
tone
of
command
;
and
she
took
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
great
bore
being
dragged
about
in
this
way
,
and
no
cigar
,
"
said
Grandcourt
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
would
like
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Like
it
!
 
<EOS>
one
eternal
chatter
.
<EOS>
And
encouraging
those
ugly
girls
 
inviting
one
to
meet
such
monsters
.
<EOS>
How
that
_
fat
_
Deronda
can
bear
looking
at
her
   
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
call
him
_
fat
<EOS>
_
?
<EOS>
Do
you
object
to
him
so
much
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Object
?
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
What
do
I
care
about
his
being
a
_
fat
_
?
<EOS>
It
's
of
no
consequence
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
'll
invite
him
to
Diplow
again
if
you
like
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
he
would
come
.
<EOS>
He
is
too
clever
and
learned
to
care
about
_
us
_
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
thinking
it
useful
for
her
husband
to
be
told
(
privately
)
that
it
was
possible
for
him
to
be
looked
down
upon
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
saw
that
make
much
difference
in
a
man
.
<EOS>
Either
he
is
a
gentleman
,
or
he
is
not
,
"
said
Grandcourt
.
  
<EOS>
That
a
new
husband
and
wife
should
snatch
,
a
moment
's
_
tete
-
à
-
tete
<EOS>
_
was
what
could
be
understood
and
indulged
;
and
the
rest
of
the
party
left
them
in
the
rear
till
,
re
-
entering
the
garden
,
they
all
paused
in
that
cloistered
court
where
,
among
the
falling
rose
-
petals
thirteen
years
before
,
we
saw
a
boy
becoming
acquainted
with
his
first
sorrow
.
<EOS>
This
cloister
was
built
of
a
harder
stone
than
the
church
,
and
had
been
in
greater
safety
from
the
wearing
weather
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
rare
example
of
a
northern
cloister
with
arched
and
pillard
openings
not
intended
for
glazing
,
and
the
delicately
-
wrought
foliage
of
the
capitals
seemed
still
to
carry
the
very
touches
of
the
chisel
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
had
dropped
her
husband
's
arm
and
joined
the
other
ladies
,
to
whom
Deronda
was
noticing
the
delicate
sense
which
had
combined
freedom
with
accuracy
in
the
imitation
of
natural
forms
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
one
oftener
learns
to
love
real
objects
through
their
representations
,
or
the
representations
through
the
real
objects
,
"
he
said
,
after
pointing
out
a
lovely
capital
made
by
the
curled
leaves
of
greens
,
showing
their
reticulated
under
-
side
with
the
firm
gradual
swell
of
its
central
rib
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
was
a
little
fellow
these
capitals
taught
me
to
observe
and
delight
in
the
structure
of
leaves
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
can
see
every
line
of
them
with
your
eyes
shut
,
"
said
Juliet
Fenn
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
I
was
always
repeating
them
,
because
for
a
good
many
years
this
court
stood
for
me
as
my
only
image
of
a
convent
,
and
whenever
I
read
of
monks
and
monasteries
,
this
was
my
scenery
for
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
love
this
place
very
much
,
"
said
Miss
Fenn
,
innocently
,
not
thinking
of
inheritance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
many
homes
are
like
twenty
others
.
<EOS>
But
this
is
unique
,
and
you
seem
to
know
every
cranny
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
you
could
never
love
another
home
so
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
carry
it
with
me
,
"
said
Deronda
,
quietly
,
being
used
to
all
possible
thoughts
of
this
kind
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
most
men
their
early
home
is
no
more
than
a
memory
of
their
early
years
,
and
I
'm
not
sure
<EOS>
but
they
have
the
best
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
image
is
never
marred
.
<EOS>
There
's
no
disappointment
in
memory
,
and
one
's
exaggerations
are
always
on
the
good
side
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
felt
sure
that
he
spoke
in
that
way
out
of
delicacy
to
her
and
Grandcourt
 
because
he
knew
they
must
hear
him
;
and
that
he
probably
thought
of
her
as
a
selfish
creature
who
only
cared
about
possessing
things
in
her
own
person
.
<EOS>
But
whatever
he
might
say
,
it
must
have
been
a
secret
hardship
to
him
that
any
circumstances
of
his
birth
had
shut
him
out
from
the
inheritance
of
his
father
's
position
;
and
if
he
supposed
that
she
exulted
in
her
husband
's
<EOS>
taking
it
,
what
could
he
feel
for
her
but
scornful
pity
?
<EOS>
Indeed
it
seemed
clear
to
her
that
he
was
avoiding
her
,
and
preferred
talking
to
others
 
which
nevertheless
was
not
kind
in
him
.
  
<EOS>
With
these
thoughts
in
her
mind
she
was
prevented
by
a
mixture
of
pride
and
timidity
from
addressing
him
again
,
and
when
they
were
looking
at
the
rows
of
quaint
portraits
in
the
gallery
above
the
cloisters
,
she
kept
up
her
air
of
interest
and
made
her
vivacious
remarks
without
any
direct
appeal
to
Deronda
.
<EOS>
But
at
the
end
she
was
very
weary
of
her
assumed
spirits
,
and
Grandcourt
turned
into
the
billiard
-
room
<EOS>
,
she
went
to
the
pretty
boudoir
which
had
been
assigned
to
her
,
and
shut
herself
up
to
look
melancholy
at
her
ease
.
<EOS>
No
chemical
process
shows
a
more
wonderful
activity
than
the
transforming
influence
of
the
thoughts
we
imagine
to
be
going
on
in
another
.
<EOS>
Changes
in
theory
,
religion
,
admirations
,
may
begin
with
a
suspicion
of
dissent
or
disapproval
,
even
when
the
grounds
of
disapproval
are
but
matter
of
searching
conjecture
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Gwendolen
was
conscious
of
an
uneasy
,
transforming
process
 
all
the
old
nature
shaken
to
its
depths
,
its
hopes
spoiled
,
its
pleasures
perturbed
,
but
still
showing
wholeness
and
strength
in
the
will
to
reassert
itself
.
<EOS>
After
every
new
shock
of
humiliation
she
tried
to
adjust
herself
and
seize
her
old
supports
 
proud
concealment
,
trust
in
new
excitements
that
would
make
life
go
by
without
much
thinking
;
trust
in
some
deed
of
reparation
to
nullify
her
self
-
blame
and
shield
her
from
a
vague
,
ever
-
visiting
dread
of
some
horrible
calamity
;
trust
in
the
hardening
effect
of
use
and
wo
nt
that
would
make
her
indifferent
to
her
miseries
.
  
<EOS>
Yes
 
miseries
.
<EOS>
This
beautiful
,
healthy
young
creature
,
with
her
two
-
and
-
twenty
years
and
her
gratified
ambition
,
no
longer
felt
inclined
to
kiss
her
fortunate
image
in
the
glass
.
<EOS>
She
looked
at
it
with
wonder
that
she
could
be
so
miserable
.
<EOS>
One
belief
which
had
accompanied
her
through
her
unmarried
life
as
a
self
-
cajoling
superstition
,
encouraged
by
the
subordination
of
every
one
about
her
 
the
belief
in
her
own
power
of
dominating
 
was
utterly
gone
.
<EOS>
Already
,
in
seven
short
weeks
,
which
seemed
half
her
life
,
her
husband
had
gained
a
mastery
which
she
could
no
more
resist
than
she
could
have
resisted
the
benumbing
effect
from
the
touch
of
a
torpedo
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
will
had
seemed
imperious
in
its
small
girlish
sway
;
but
it
was
the
will
of
a
creature
with
a
large
discourse
of
imaginative
fears
:
a
shadow
would
have
been
enough
to
relax
its
hold
.
<EOS>
And
she
had
found
a
will
like
that
of
a
crab
or
a
boa
-
constrictor
,
which
goes
on
pinching
or
crushing
without
alarm
at
thunder
.
<EOS>
Not
that
Grandcourt
was
without
calculation
of
the
intangible
effects
which
were
the
chief
means
of
mastery
;
indeed
,
he
had
a
surprising
acuteness
in
detecting
that
situation
of
feeling
in
Gwendolen
which
made
her
proud
and
rebellious
spirit
dumb
and
helpless
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
burned
Lydia
Glasher
's
letter
with
an
instantaneous
terror
lest
other
eyes
should
see
it
,
and
had
tenaciously
concealed
from
Grandcourt
that
there
was
any
other
cause
of
her
violent
hysterics
than
the
excitement
and
fatigue
of
the
day
:
she
had
been
urged
into
an
implied
falsehood
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
ask
me
 
it
was
my
feeling
about
everything
 
<EOS>
it
was
the
sudden
change
from
home
.
<EOS>
"
The
words
of
that
letter
kept
repeating
themselves
,
and
hung
on
her
consciousness
with
the
weight
of
a
prophetic
doom
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
the
grave
in
which
your
chance
of
happiness
is
buried
as
well
as
mine
.
<EOS>
You
had
your
warning
.
<EOS>
You
have
chosen
to
injure
me
and
my
children
.
<EOS>
He
had
meant
to
marry
me
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
married
me
at
last
,
if
you
had
not
broken
your
word
.
<EOS>
You
will
have
your
punishment
.
<EOS>
I
desire
it
with
all
my
soul
.
<EOS>
Will
you
give
him
this
letter
to
set
him
against
me
and
ruin
us
more
 
me
and
my
children
?
<EOS>
Shall
you
like
to
stand
before
your
husband
with
these
diamonds
on
you
,
and
these
words
of
mine
in
his
thoughts
and
yours
?
<EOS>
Will
he
think
you
have
any
right
to
complain
when
he
has
made
you
miserable
?
<EOS>
You
took
him
with
your
eyes
open
.
<EOS>
The
willing
wrong
you
have
done
me
will
be
your
curse
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
words
had
nestled
their
venomous
life
within
her
,
and
stirred
continually
the
vision
of
the
scene
at
the
Whispering
Stones
.
<EOS>
That
scene
was
now
like
an
accusing
apparition
:
she
dreaded
that
Grandcourt
should
know
of
it
 
so
far
out
of
her
sight
<EOS>
now
was
that
possibility
she
had
once
satisfied
herself
with
,
of
speaking
to
him
about
Mrs.
Glasher
and
her
children
,
and
making
them
rich
amends
.
<EOS>
Any
endurance
seemed
easier
than
the
mortal
humiliation
of
confessing
that
she
knew
all
before
she
married
him
,
and
in
marrying
him
had
broken
her
word
.
<EOS>
For
the
reasons
by
which
she
had
justified
herself
when
the
marriage
tempted
her
,
and
all
her
easy
arrangement
of
her
future
power
over
her
husband
to
make
him
do
better
than
he
might
be
inclined
to
do
,
were
now
as
futile
as
the
burned
-
out
lights
which
set
off
a
child
's
pageant
.
<EOS>
Her
sense
of
being
blameworthy
was
exaggerated
by
a
dread
both
definite
and
vague
.
<EOS>
The
definite
dread
was
lest
the
veil
of
secrecy
should
fall
between
her
and
Grandcourt
,
and
give
him
the
right
to
taunt
her
.
<EOS>
With
the
reading
of
that
letter
had
begun
her
husband
's
empire
of
fear
.
  
<EOS>
And
her
husband
all
the
while
knew
it
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
,
indeed
,
any
distinct
knowledge
of
her
broken
promise
,
and
would
not
have
rated
highly
the
effect
of
that
breach
on
her
conscience
;
but
he
was
aware
not
only
of
what
Lush
had
told
him
about
the
meeting
at
the
Whispering
Stones
,
but
also
of
Gwendolen
's
concealment
as
to
the
cause
of
her
sudden
illness
.
<EOS>
He
felt
sure
that
Lydia
had
enclosed
something
with
the
diamonds
,
and
that
this
something
,
whatever
it
was
,
had
at
once
created
in
Gwendolen
a
new
repulsion
for
him
and
a
reason
for
not
daring
to
manifest
it
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
greatly
mind
,
or
feel
as
many
men
might
have
felt
,
that
his
hopes
in
marriage
were
blighted
:
he
had
wanted
to
marry
Gwendolen
,
and
he
was
not
a
man
to
repent
.
<EOS>
Why
should
a
gentleman
whose
other
relations
in
life
are
carried
on
without
the
luxury
of
sympathetic
feeling
,
be
supposed
to
require
that
kind
of
condiment
in
domestic
life
?
<EOS>
What
he
chiefly
felt
was
that
a
change
had
come
over
the
conditions
of
his
mastery
,
which
,
far
from
shaking
it
,
might
establish
it
the
more
thoroughly
.
<EOS>
And
it
was
established
.
<EOS>
He
judged
that
he
had
not
married
a
simpleton
unable
to
perceive
the
impossibility
of
escape
,
or
to
see
alternative
evils
:
he
had
married
a
girl
who
had
spirit
and
pride
enough
not
to
make
a
fool
of
herself
by
forfeiting
all
the
advantages
of
a
position
which
had
attracted
her
;
and
if
she
wanted
pregnant
hints
to
help
her
in
making
up
her
mind
properly
he
would
take
care
not
to
withhold
them
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
indeed
,
with
all
that
gnawing
trouble
in
her
consciousness
,
had
hardly
for
a
moment
dropped
the
sense
that
it
was
her
part
to
bear
herself
with
dignity
,
and
appear
what
is
called
happy
.
<EOS>
In
disclosure
of
disappointment
or
sorrow
she
saw
nothing
but
a
humiliation
which
would
have
been
vinegar
to
her
wounds
.
<EOS>
Whatever
her
husband
might
have
come
at
last
to
be
to
her
,
she
meant
to
wear
the
yoke
so
as
not
to
be
pitied
.
<EOS>
For
she
did
think
of
the
coming
years
with
presentiment
:
she
was
frightened
at
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
The
poor
thing
had
passed
from
her
girlish
sauciness
of
superiority
over
this
inert
specimen
of
personal
distinction
into
an
amazed
perception
of
her
former
ignorance
about
the
possible
mental
attitude
of
a
man
toward
the
woman
he
sought
in
marriage
 
of
her
present
ignorance
as
to
what
their
life
with
each
other
might
turn
into
.
<EOS>
For
novelty
gives
immeasurableness
to
fear
,
and
fills
the
early
time
of
all
sad
changes
with
phantoms
of
the
future
.
<EOS>
Her
little
coquetries
,
voluntary
or
involuntary
,
had
told
on
Grandcourt
during
courtship
,
and
formed
a
medium
of
communication
between
them
,
showing
him
in
the
light
of
a
creature
such
as
she
could
understand
and
manage
:
<EOS>
But
marriage
had
nulified
all
such
interchange
,
and
Grandcourt
had
become
a
blank
uncertainty
to
her
in
everything
<EOS>
but
this
,
that
he
would
do
just
what
he
willed
,
and
that
she
had
neither
devices
at
her
command
to
determine
his
will
,
nor
any
rational
means
of
escaping
it
.
  
<EOS>
What
had
occurred
between
them
and
her
wearing
the
diamonds
was
typical
.
<EOS>
One
evening
,
shortly
before
they
came
to
the
Abbey
,
they
were
going
to
dine
at
Brackenshaw
Castle
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
had
said
to
herself
that
she
would
never
wear
those
diamonds
:
they
had
horrible
words
clinging
and
crawling
about
them
,
as
from
some
bad
dream
,
whose
images
lingered
on
the
perturbed
sense
.
<EOS>
She
came
down
dressed
in
her
white
,
with
only
a
streak
of
gold
and
a
pendant
of
emeralds
,
which
Grandcourt
had
given
her
,
round
her
neck
,
and
the
little
emerald
stars
in
her
ears
.
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fire
and
looked
at
her
as
she
entered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Am
I
altogether
as
you
like
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
speaking
rather
gaily
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
without
enjoyment
in
this
occasion
of
going
to
Brackenshaw
Castle
with
her
new
dignities
upon
her
,
as
men
whose
affairs
are
sadly
involved
will
enjoy
dining
out
among
persons
likely
to
be
under
a
pleasant
mistake
about
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Grandcourt
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
felt
suddenly
uncomfortable
,
wondering
what
was
to
come
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
unprepared
for
some
struggle
about
the
diamonds
;
but
suppose
he
were
going
to
say
,
in
low
,
contemptuous
tones
,
"
You
are
not
in
any
way
what
I
like
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
very
bad
for
her
to
be
secretly
hating
him
;
but
it
would
be
much
worse
when
he
gave
the
first
sign
of
hating
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
mercy
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
the
pause
lasting
till
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
.
"
<EOS>
How
am
I
to
alter
myself
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Put
on
the
diamonds
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
looking
straight
at
her
with
his
narrow
glance
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
paused
in
her
turn
,
afraid
of
showing
any
emotion
,
and
feeling
that
nevertheless
there
was
some
change
in
her
eyes
as
they
met
his
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
obliged
to
answer
,
and
said
as
indifferently
as
she
could
,
"
Oh
,
please
not
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
diamonds
suit
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
you
think
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
his
_
sotto
voce
_
imperiousness
seeming
to
have
an
evening
quietude
and
finish
,
like
his
toilet
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
to
wear
the
diamonds
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Pray
excuse
me
;
I
like
these
emeralds
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
frightened
in
spite
of
her
preparation
.
<EOS>
That
white
hand
of
his
which
was
touching
his
whisker
was
capable
,
she
fancied
,
of
clinging
round
her
neck
and
threatening
to
throttle
her
;
for
her
fear
of
him
,
mingling
with
the
vague
foreboding
of
some
retributive
calamity
which
hung
about
her
life
,
had
reached
a
superstitious
point
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oblige
me
by
telling
me
your
reason
for
not
wearing
the
diamonds
when
I
desire
it
,
"
said
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
still
fixed
upon
her
,
and
she
felt
her
own
eyes
narrowing
under
them
as
if
to
shut
out
an
entering
pain
.
  
<EOS>
Of
what
use
was
the
rebellion
within
her
?
<EOS>
She
could
say
nothing
that
would
not
hurt
her
worse
than
submission
.
<EOS>
Turning
slowing
and
covering
herself
again
,
she
went
to
her
dressing
-
room
.
<EOS>
As
she
reached
out
the
diamonds
it
occurred
to
her
that
her
unwillingness
to
wear
them
might
have
already
raised
a
suspicion
in
Grandcourt
that
she
had
some
knowledge
about
them
which
he
had
not
given
her
.
<EOS>
She
fancied
that
his
eyes
showed
a
delight
in
torturing
her
.
<EOS>
How
could
she
be
defiant
?
<EOS>
She
had
nothing
to
say
that
would
touch
him
 
nothing
but
what
would
give
him
a
more
painful
grasp
on
her
consciousness
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
delights
in
making
the
dogs
and
horses
quail
:
<EOS>
that
is
half
his
pleasure
in
calling
them
his
,
"
she
said
to
herself
,
as
she
opened
the
jewel
-
case
with
a
shivering
sensation
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
come
to
be
so
with
me
;
and
I
shall
quail
.
<EOS>
What
else
is
there
for
me
?
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
to
the
world
,
"
Pity
me
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
about
to
ring
for
her
maid
when
she
heard
the
door
open
behind
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
Grandcourt
who
came
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
want
some
one
to
fasten
them
,
"
he
said
,
coming
toward
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
did
not
answer
,
but
simply
stood
still
,
leaving
him
to
take
out
the
ornaments
and
fasten
them
as
he
would
.
<EOS>
Doubtless
he
had
been
used
to
fasten
them
on
some
one
else
.
<EOS>
With
a
bitter
sort
of
sarcasm
against
herself
,
Gwendolen
thought
,
"
What
a
privilege
this
is
,
to
have
robbed
another
woman
of
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
makes
you
so
cold
?
"
said
Grandcourt
,
when
he
had
fastened
the
last
ear
-
ring
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Pray
put
plenty
of
furs
on
.
<EOS>
I
hate
to
see
a
woman
come
into
a
room
looking
frozen
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
to
appear
as
a
bride
at
all
,
appear
decently
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
martial
speech
was
not
exactly
persuasive
,
but
it
touched
the
quick
of
Gwendolen
's
pride
and
forced
her
to
rally
.
<EOS>
The
words
of
the
bad
dream
crawled
about
the
diamonds
still
,
but
only
for
her
:
to
others
they
were
brilliants
that
suited
her
perfectly
,
and
Grandcourt
inwardly
observed
that
she
answered
to
the
rein
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
mamma
,
quite
happy
<EOS>
,
"
Gwendolen
had
said
on
her
return
to
Diplow
.
"
Not
at
all
disappointed
in
Ryelands
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
much
finer
place
than
this
 
larger
in
every
way
.
<EOS>
But
do
n't
you
want
some
more
money
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
not
know
that
Mr.
Grandcourt
left
me
a
letter
on
your
wedding
-
day
?
<EOS>
I
am
to
have
eight
hundred
a
year
.
<EOS>
He
wishes
me
to
keep
Offendene
for
the
present
,
while
you
are
at
Diplow
.
<EOS>
But
if
there
were
some
pretty
cottage
near
the
park
at
Ryelands
we
might
live
there
without
much
expense
,
and
I
should
have
you
most
of
the
year
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
leave
that
to
Mr.
Grandcourt
,
mamma
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
It
is
exceedingly
handsome
of
him
to
say
that
he
will
pay
the
rent
for
Offendene
till
June
.
<EOS>
And
we
can
go
on
very
well
 
without
any
man
-
servant
except
Crane
,
just
for
out
-
of
-
doors
.
<EOS>
Our
good
Merry
will
stay
with
us
and
help
me
to
manage
everything
.
<EOS>
It
is
natural
that
Mr.
Grandcourt
should
wish
me
to
live
in
a
good
style
of
house
in
your
neighborhood
,
and
I
can
not
decline
.
<EOS>
So
he
said
nothing
about
it
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
he
wished
me
to
hear
it
from
you
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
in
fact
had
been
very
anxious
to
have
some
definite
knowledge
of
what
would
be
done
for
her
mother
,
but
at
no
moment
since
her
marriage
had
she
been
able
to
overcome
the
difficulty
of
mentioning
the
subject
to
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
Now
,
however
,
she
had
a
sense
of
obligation
which
would
not
let
her
rest
without
saying
to
him
,
"
It
is
very
good
of
you
to
provide
for
mamma
.
<EOS>
You
took
a
great
deal
on
yourself
in
marrying
a
girl
who
had
nothing
but
relations
belonging
to
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
was
smoking
,
and
only
said
carelessly
,
"
Of
course
I
was
not
going
to
let
her
live
like
a
gamekeeper
's
mother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
least
he
is
not
mean
about
money
,
"
thought
Gwendolen
,
"
and
mamma
is
the
better
off
for
my
marriage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
often
pursued
the
comparison
between
what
might
have
been
,
if
she
had
not
married
Grandcourt
,
and
what
actually
was
,
trying
to
persuade
herself
that
life
generally
was
barren
of
satisfaction
,
and
that
if
she
had
chosen
differently
she
might
now
have
been
looking
back
with
a
regret
as
bitter
as
the
feeling
she
was
trying
to
argue
away
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
's
dullness
,
which
used
to
irritate
her
,
she
was
at
present
inclined
to
explain
as
the
ordinary
result
of
woman
's
experience
.
<EOS>
True
,
she
still
saw
that
she
would
"
manage
differently
from
mamma
;
"
but
her
management
now
only
meant
that
she
would
carry
her
troubles
with
spirit
,
and
let
none
suspect
them
.
<EOS>
By
and
by
she
promised
herself
that
she
should
get
used
to
her
heart
-
sores
,
and
find
excitements
that
would
carry
her
through
life
,
as
a
hard
gallop
carried
her
through
some
of
the
morning
hours
.
<EOS>
There
was
gambling
:
she
had
heard
stories
at
Leubronn
of
fashionable
women
who
gambled
in
all
sorts
of
ways
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
very
flat
to
her
at
this
distance
,
but
perhaps
if
she
began
to
gamble
again
,
the
passion
might
awake
.
<EOS>
Then
there
was
the
pleasure
of
producing
an
effect
by
her
appearance
in
society
:
<EOS>
what
did
celebrated
beauties
do
in
town
when
their
husbands
could
afford
display
?
<EOS>
All
men
were
fascinated
by
them
:
they
had
a
perfect
equipage
and
toilet
,
walked
into
public
places
,
and
bowed
,
and
made
the
usual
answers
,
and
walked
out
again
,
perhaps
they
bought
china
,
and
practiced
accomplishments
.
<EOS>
If
she
could
only
feel
a
keen
appetite
for
those
pleasures
 
could
only
believe
in
pleasure
as
she
used
to
do
!
<EOS>
Accomplishments
had
ceased
to
have
the
exciting
quality
of
promising
any
pre
-
eminence
to
her
;
and
as
for
fascinated
gentlemen
 
adorers
who
might
hover
round
her
with
languishment
,
and
diversify
married
life
with
the
romantic
stir
of
mystery
,
passion
,
and
danger
,
which
her
French
reading
had
given
her
some
girlish
notion
of
 
they
presented
themselves
to
her
imagination
with
the
fatal
circumstance
that
,
instead
of
fascinating
her
in
return
,
they
were
clad
in
her
own
weariness
and
disgust
.
<EOS>
The
admiring
male
,
rashly
adjusting
the
expression
of
his
features
and
the
turn
of
his
conversation
to
her
supposed
tastes
,
had
always
been
an
absurd
object
to
her
,
and
at
present
seemed
rather
detestable
.
<EOS>
Many
courses
are
actually
pursued
 
follies
and
sins
both
convenient
and
inconvenient
 
without
pleasure
or
hope
of
pleasure
;
but
to
solace
ourselves
with
imagining
any
course
beforehand
,
there
must
be
some
foretaste
of
pleasure
in
the
shape
of
appetite
;
and
Gwendolen
's
appetite
had
sickened
.
<EOS>
Let
her
wander
over
the
possibilities
of
her
life
as
she
would
,
an
uncertain
shadow
dogged
her
.
<EOS>
Her
confidence
in
herself
and
her
destiny
had
turned
into
remorse
and
dread
;
she
trusted
neither
herself
nor
her
future
.
  
<EOS>
This
hidden
helplessness
gave
fresh
force
to
the
hold
Deronda
had
from
the
first
taken
on
her
mind
,
as
one
who
had
an
unknown
standard
by
which
he
judged
her
.
<EOS>
Had
he
some
way
of
looking
at
things
which
might
be
a
new
footing
for
her
 
an
inward
safeguard
against
possible
events
which
she
dreaded
as
stored
-
up
retribution
?
<EOS>
It
is
one
of
the
secrets
in
that
change
of
mental
poise
which
has
been
fitly
named
conversion
,
that
to
many
among
us
<EOS>
neither
heaven
nor
earth
has
any
revelation
till
some
personality
touches
theirs
with
a
peculiar
influence
,
subduing
them
into
receptiveness
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
Gwendolen
's
habit
to
think
of
the
persons
around
her
as
stale
books
,
too
familiar
to
be
interesting
.
<EOS>
Deronda
had
lit
up
her
attention
with
a
sense
of
novelty
:
not
by
words
only
,
but
by
imagined
facts
,
his
influence
had
entered
into
the
current
of
that
self
-
suspicion
and
self
-
blame
which
awakens
a
new
consciousness
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
he
could
know
everything
about
me
without
my
telling
him
,
"
was
one
of
her
thoughts
,
as
she
sat
leaning
over
the
end
of
a
couch
,
supporting
her
head
with
her
hand
,
and
looking
at
herself
in
a
mirror
 
not
in
admiration
,
but
in
a
sad
kind
of
companionship
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
he
knew
that
I
am
not
so
contemptible
as
he
thinks
me
;
that
I
am
in
deep
trouble
,
and
want
to
be
something
better
if
I
could
.
<EOS>
"
Without
the
aid
of
sacred
ceremony
or
costume
,
her
feelings
had
turned
this
man
,
only
a
few
years
older
than
herself
,
into
a
priest
;
a
sort
of
trust
less
rare
than
the
fidelity
that
guards
it
.
<EOS>
Young
reverence
for
one
who
is
also
young
is
the
most
coercive
of
all
:
there
is
the
same
level
of
temptation
,
and
the
higher
motive
is
believed
in
as
a
fuller
force
 
not
suspected
to
be
a
mere
residue
from
weary
experience
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
coercion
is
often
stronger
on
the
one
who
takes
the
reverence
.
<EOS>
Those
who
trust
us
educate
us
.
<EOS>
And
perhaps
in
that
ideal
consecration
of
Gwendolen
's
,
some
education
was
being
prepared
for
Deronda
.
      
<EOS>
"
Rien
ne
<EOS>

tant
qu'un

<EOS>
Le

LA

<EOS>
Meanwhile
Deronda
had
been
fastened
and
led
off
by
Mr.
Vandernoodt
,
who
wished
for
a
brisker
walk
,
a
cigar
,
and
a
little
gossip
.
<EOS>
Since
we
can
not
tell
a
man
his
own
secrets
,
the
restraint
of
being
in
his
company
often
breeds
a
desire
to
pair
off
in
conversation
with
some
more
ignorant
person
,
and
Mr.
Vandernoodt
presently
said
    
"
What
a
washed
-
out
piece
of
cambric
Grandcourt
is
!
<EOS>
But
if
he
is
a
favorite
of
yours
,
I
withdraw
the
remark
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
the
least
in
the
world
,
"
said
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
not
.
<EOS>
One
wonders
how
he
came
to
have
a
great
passion
again
;
and
he
must
have
had
 
to
marry
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
Though
Lush
,
his
old
chum
,
hints
that
he
married
this
girl
out
of
obstinacy
.
<EOS>
By
George
!
<EOS>
it
was
a
very
accountable
obstinacy
.
<EOS>
A
man
might
make
up
his
mind
to
marry
her
without
the
stimulus
of
contradiction
.
<EOS>
But
he
must
have
made
himself
a
pretty
large
drain
of
money
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
of
his
affairs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
not
of
the
other
establishment
he
keeps
up
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Diplow
?
<EOS>
Of
course
.
<EOS>
He
took
that
of
Sir
Hugo
.
<EOS>
But
merely
for
the
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
;
not
Diplow
:
Gadsmere
.
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
knows
,
I
'll
answer
for
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
really
began
to
feel
some
curiosity
,
but
he
foresaw
that
he
should
hear
what
Mr.
Vandernoodt
had
to
tell
,
without
the
condescension
of
asking
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lush
would
not
altogether
own
to
it
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
He
's
a
confident
and
go
-
between
of
Grandcourt
's
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
it
on
the
best
authority
.
<EOS>
The
fact
is
,
there
's
another
lady
with
four
children
at
Gadsmere
.
<EOS>
She
has
had
the
upper
hand
of
him
these
ten
years
and
more
,
and
by
what
I
can
understand
has
it
still
 
left
her
husband
for
him
,
and
used
to
travel
with
him
everywhere
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
's
dead
now
;
I
found
a
fellow
who
was
in
the
same
regiment
with
him
,
and
knew
this
Mrs.
Glasher
before
she
took
wing
.
<EOS>
A
fiery
dark
-
eyed
woman
 
a
noted
beauty
at
that
time
 
<EOS>
he
thought
she
was
dead
.
<EOS>
They
say
she
has
Grandcourt
under
her
thumb
still
,
and
it
's
a
wonder
he
did
n't
marry
her
,
<EOS>
for
there
's
a
very
fine
boy
,
and
I
understand
Grandcourt
can
do
absolutely
as
he
pleases
with
the
estates
.
<EOS>
Lush
told
me
as
much
as
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
right
had
he
to
marry
this
girl
?
<EOS>
"
said
Deronda
,
with
disgust
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Vandernoodt
,
adjusting
the
end
of
his
cigar
,
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
put
out
his
lips
.
  
<EOS>
"
_
She
_
can
know
nothing
of
it
,
"
said
Deronda
,
emphatically
.
<EOS>
But
that
positive
statement
was
immediately
followed
by
an
inward
query
 
<EOS>
"
Could
she
have
known
anything
of
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
rather
a
piquant
picture
,
"
said
Mr.
Vandernoodt
 
<EOS>
"
Grandcourt
between
two
fiery
women
.
<EOS>
For
depend
upon
it
this
light
-
haired
one
has
plenty
of
devil
in
her
.
<EOS>
I
formed
that
opinion
of
her
at
Leubronn
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
sort
of
Medea
and
Creüsa
business
.
<EOS>
Fancy
the
two
meeting
!
<EOS>
Grandcourt
is
a
new
kind
of
Jason
:
I
wonder
what
sort
of
a
part
he
'll
make
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
dog
's
part
at
best
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
hear
Ristori
now
,
saying
,
"
Jasone
!
<EOS>
Jasone
!
"
<EOS>
These
fine
women
generally
get
hold
of
a
stick
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Grandcourt
can
bite
,
I
fancy
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
He
is
no
stick
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
;
I
meant
Jason
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
quite
make
out
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
But
he
's
a
keen
fellow
enough
 
uncommonly
well
built
too
.
<EOS>
And
if
he
comes
into
all
this
property
,
the
estates
will
bear
dividing
.
<EOS>
This
girl
,
whose
friends
had
come
to
beggary
,
I
understand
,
may
think
herself
lucky
to
get
him
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
to
be
hard
on
a
man
because
he
gets
involved
in
an
affair
of
that
sort
.
<EOS>
But
he
might
make
himself
more
agreeable
.
<EOS>
I
was
telling
him
a
capital
story
last
night
,
and
he
got
up
and
walked
away
in
the
middle
.
<EOS>
I
felt
inclined
to
kick
him
.
<EOS>
Do
you
suppose
that
is
inattention
or
insolence
,
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
a
mixture
.
<EOS>
He
generally
observes
the
forms
:
but
he
does
n't
listen
much
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
Then
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
he
went
on
,
"
I
should
think
there
must
be
some
exaggeration
or
inaccuracy
in
what
you
have
heard
about
this
lady
at
Gadsmere
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
a
bit
,
depend
upon
it
;
it
has
all
lain
snug
of
late
years
.
<EOS>
People
have
forgotten
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
But
there
the
nest
is
,
and
the
birds
are
in
it
.
<EOS>
And
I
know
Grandcourt
goes
there
.
<EOS>
I
have
good
evidence
that
he
goes
there
.
<EOS>
However
,
that
's
nobody
's
business
but
his
own
.
<EOS>
The
affair
has
sunk
below
the
surface
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
you
could
have
learned
so
much
about
it
,
"
said
Deronda
,
rather
drily
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
there
are
plenty
of
people
who
knew
all
about
it
;
but
such
stories
get
packed
away
like
old
letters
.
<EOS>
They
interest
me
.
<EOS>
I
like
to
know
the
manners
of
my
time
 
contemporary
gossip
,
not
antediluvian
.
<EOS>
These
Dryasdust
fellows
get
a
reputation
by
raking
up
some
small
scandal
about
Semiramis
or
Nitocris
,
and
then
we
have
a
thousand
and
one
poems
written
upon
it
by
all
the
warblers
big
and
little
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
care
a
straw
about
the
_
faux
pas
_
of
the
mummies
.
<EOS>
You
do
,
though
.
<EOS>
You
are
one
of
the
historical
men
 
more
interested
in
a
lady
when
she
's
got
a
rag
face
and
skeleton
toes
peeping
out
.
<EOS>
Does
that
flatter
your
imagination
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
if
she
had
any
woes
in
her
love
,
one
has
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
she
's
well
out
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
you
are
thinking
of
the
Medea
,
I
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
then
chose
to
point
to
some
giant
oaks
worth
looking
at
in
their
bareness
.
<EOS>
He
also
felt
an
interest
in
this
piece
of
contemporary
gossip
,
but
he
was
satisfied
that
Mr.
Vandernoodt
had
no
more
to
tell
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
Since
the
early
days
when
he
tried
to
construct
the
hidden
story
of
his
own
birth
,
his
mind
had
perhaps
never
been
so
active
in
weaving
probabilities
about
any
private
affair
as
it
had
now
begun
to
be
about
Gwendolen
's
marriage
.
<EOS>
This
unavowed
relation
of
Grandcourt
's
 
could
she
have
gained
some
knowledge
of
it
,
which
caused
her
to
shrink
from
the
match
 
<EOS>
a
shrinking
finally
overcome
by
the
urgence
of
poverty
?
<EOS>
He
could
recall
almost
every
word
she
had
said
to
him
,
and
in
certain
of
these
words
he
seemed
to
discern
that
she
was
conscious
of
having
done
some
wrong
 
inflicted
some
injury
.
<EOS>
His
own
acute
experience
made
him
alive
to
the
form
of
injury
which
might
affect
the
unavowed
children
and
their
mother
.
<EOS>
Was
Mrs.
Grandcourt
,
under
all
her
determined
show
of
satisfaction
,
gnawed
by
a
double
,
a
treble
-
headed
grief
 
self
-
reproach
,
disappointment
,
<EOS>
jealousy
?
<EOS>
He
dwelt
especially
on
all
the
slight
signs
of
self
-
reproach
:
he
was
inclined
to
judge
her
tenderly
,
to
excuse
,
to
pity
.
<EOS>
He
thought
he
had
found
a
key
now
by
which
to
interpret
her
more
clearly
:
what
magnifying
of
her
misery
might
not
a
young
creature
get
into
who
had
wedded
her
fresh
hopes
to
old
secrets
!
<EOS>
He
thought
he
saw
clearly
enough
now
why
Sir
Hugo
had
never
dropped
any
hint
of
this
affair
to
him
;
and
immediately
the
image
of
this
Mrs.
Glasher
became
painfully
associated
with
his
own
hidden
birth
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
knowing
of
that
woman
and
her
children
,
marrying
Grandcourt
,
and
showing
herself
contented
,
would
have
been
among
the
most
repulsive
of
beings
to
him
;
but
Gwendolen
tasting
the
bitterness
of
remorse
for
having
contributed
to
their
injury
was
brought
very
near
to
his
fellow
-
feeling
.
<EOS>
If
it
were
so
,
she
had
got
to
a
common
plane
of
understanding
with
him
on
some
difficulties
of
life
which
a
woman
is
rarely
able
to
judge
of
with
any
justice
or
generosity
;
for
,
according
to
precedent
,
Gwendolen
's
view
of
her
position
might
easily
have
been
no
other
than
that
her
husband
's
marriage
with
her
was
his
entrance
on
the
path
of
virtue
,
while
Mrs.
Glasher
represented
his
forsaken
sin
.
<EOS>
And
Deronda
had
naturally
some
resentment
on
behalf
of
the
Hagars
and
Ishmaels
.
  
<EOS>
Undeniably
Deronda
's
growing
solicitude
about
Gwendolen
depended
chiefly
on
her
peculiar
manner
toward
him
;
and
I
suppose
neither
man
nor
woman
would
be
the
better
for
an
utter
insensibility
to
such
appeals
.
<EOS>
One
sign
that
his
interest
in
her
had
changed
its
footing
was
that
he
dismissed
any
caution
against
her
being
a
coquette
setting
snares
to
involve
him
in
a
vulgar
flirtation
,
and
determined
that
he
would
not
again
evade
any
opportunity
of
talking
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
had
shaken
off
Mr.
Vandernoodt
,
and
got
into
a
solitary
corner
in
the
twilight
;
but
half
an
hour
was
long
enough
to
think
of
those
possibilities
in
Gwendolen
's
position
and
state
of
mind
;
and
on
forming
the
determination
not
to
avoid
her
,
he
remembered
that
she
was
likely
to
be
at
tea
with
the
other
ladies
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
The
conjecture
was
true
;
for
Gwendolen
,
after
resolving
not
to
go
down
again
for
the
next
four
hours
,
began
to
feel
,
at
the
end
of
one
,
that
in
shutting
herself
up
she
missed
all
chances
of
seeing
and
hearing
,
and
that
her
visit
would
only
last
two
days
more
.
<EOS>
She
adjusted
herself
,
put
on
her
little
air
of
self
-
possession
,
and
going
down
,
made
herself
resolutely
agreeable
.
<EOS>
Only
ladies
were
assembled
,
and
Lady
Pentreath
was
amusing
them
with
a
description
of
a
drawing
-
room
under
the
Regency
,
and
the
figure
that
was
cut
by
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
1819
,
the
year
she
was
presented
 
when
Deronda
entered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
be
acceptable
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
had
better
go
back
and
look
for
the
others
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
they
are
in
the
billiard
-
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
;
stay
where
you
are
,
"
said
Lady
Pentreath
.
<EOS>
"
They
were
all
getting
tired
of
me
;
let
us
hear
what
_
you
_
have
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
rather
an
embarrassing
appeal
,
"
said
Deronda
,
drawing
up
a
chair
near
Lady
Mallinger
's
elbow
at
the
tea
-
table
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
had
better
take
the
opportunity
of
mentioning
our
songstress
,
"
he
added
,
looking
at
Lady
Mallinger
 
"
unless
you
have
done
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
the
little
Jewess
!
"
said
Lady
Mallinger
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
I
have
not
mentioned
her
.
<EOS>
It
never
entered
my
head
that
any
one
here
wanted
singing
lessons
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
ladies
know
some
one
else
who
wants
singing
lessons
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
happened
to
find
an
exquisite
singer
,
"
 
<EOS>
here
he
turned
to
Lady
Pentreath
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
living
with
some
ladies
who
are
friends
of
mine
 
<EOS>
the
mother
and
sisters
of
a
man
who
was
my
chum
at
Cambridge
.
<EOS>
She
was
on
the
stage
at
Vienna
;
but
she
wants
to
leave
that
life
,
and
maintain
herself
by
teaching
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
are
swarms
of
those
people
,
are
n't
there
?
"
said
the
old
lady
.
<EOS>
"
Are
her
lessons
to
be
very
cheap
or
very
expensive
?
<EOS>
Those
are
the
two
baits
I
know
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
another
bait
for
those
who
hear
her
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
singing
is
something
quite
exceptional
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
She
has
had
such
first
-
rate
teaching
 
or
rather
first
-
rate
instinct
with
her
teaching
 
that
you
might
imagine
her
singing
all
came
by
nature
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
did
she
leave
the
stage
,
then
?
"
said
Lady
Pentreath
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
too
old
to
believe
in
first
-
rate
people
giving
up
first
-
rate
chances
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Her
voice
was
too
weak
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
delicious
voice
for
a
room
.
<EOS>
You
who
put
up
with
my
singing
of
Schubert
would
be
enchanted
with
hers
,
"
said
Deronda
,
looking
at
Mrs.
Raymond
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
imagine
she
would
not
object
to
sing
at
private
parties
or
concerts
.
<EOS>
Her
voice
is
quite
equal
to
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
to
have
her
in
my
drawing
-
room
when
we
go
up
to
town
,
"
said
Lady
Mallinger
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
hear
her
then
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
heard
her
myself
yet
;
but
I
trust
Daniel
's
recommendation
.
<EOS>
I
mean
my
girls
to
have
lessons
of
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
a
charitable
affair
?
"
said
Lady
Pentreath
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
bear
charitable
music
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Mallinger
,
who
was
rather
helpless
in
conversation
,
and
felt
herself
under
an
engagement
not
to
tell
anything
of
Mirah
's
story
,
had
an
embarrassed
smile
on
her
face
,
and
glanced
at
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
charity
to
those
who
want
to
have
a
good
model
of
feminine
singing
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
everybody
who
has
ears
would
benefit
by
a
little
improvement
on
the
ordinary
style
.
<EOS>
If
you
heard
Miss
Lapidoth
"
 
here
he
looked
at
Gwendolen
 
<EOS>
"
perhaps
you
would
revoke
your
resolution
to
give
up
singing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
rather
think
my
resolution
would
be
confirmed
,
"
said
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
feel
able
to
follow
your
advice
of
enjoying
my
own
middlingness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
my
part
,
"
said
Deronda
,
"
people
who
do
anything
finely
always
inspirit
me
to
try
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mean
that
they
make
me
believe
I
can
do
it
as
well
.
<EOS>
But
they
make
the
thing
,
whatever
it
may
be
,
seem
worthy
to
be
done
.
<EOS>
I
can
bear
to
think
my
own
music
not
good
for
much
,
but
the
world
would
be
more
dismal
if
I
thought
music
itself
not
good
for
much
.
<EOS>
Excellence
encourages
one
about
life
generally
;
it
shows
the
spiritual
wealth
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
then
,
if
we
ca
n't
imitate
it
,
it
only
makes
our
own
life
seem
the
tamer
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
in
a
mood
to
resent
encouragement
founded
on
her
own
insignificance
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
depends
on
the
point
of
view
,
I
think
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
We
should
have
a
poor
life
of
it
if
we
were
reduced
for
all
our
pleasure
to
our
own
performances
.
<EOS>
A
little
private
imitation
of
what
is
good
is
a
sort
of
private
devotion
to
it
,
and
most
of
us
ought
to
practice
art
only
in
the
light
of
private
study
 
preparation
to
understand
and
enjoy
what
the
few
can
do
for
us
.
<EOS>
I
think
Miss
Lapidoth
is
one
of
the
few
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
must
be
a
very
happy
person
,
do
n't
you
think
?
"
said
Gwendolen
,
with
a
touch
of
sarcasm
,
and
a
turn
of
her
neck
toward
Mrs.
Raymond
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
answered
the
independent
lady
;
"
I
must
hear
more
of
her
before
I
say
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
have
been
a
bitter
disappointment
to
her
that
her
voice
failed
her
for
the
stage
,
"
said
Juliet
Fenn
,
sympathetically
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
she
's
past
<EOS>
her
best
,
though
,
"
said
the
deep
voice
of
Lady
Pentreath
.
  
<EOS>
"
On
the
contrary
,
she
has
not
reached
it
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
barely
twenty
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
very
pretty
,
"
interposed
Lady
Mallinger
,
with
an
amiable
wish
to
help
Deronda
.
"
<EOS>
And
she
has
very
good
manners
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sorry
she
's
a
bigoted
Jewess
;
I
should
not
like
it
for
anything
else
,
but
it
does
n't
matter
in
singing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
since
her
voice
is
too
weak
for
her
to
scream
much
,
I
'll
tell
Lady
Clementina
to
set
her
on
my
nine
granddaughters
,
"
said
Lady
Pentreath
;
"
and
I
hope
she
'll
convince
eight
of
them
that
they
have
not
voice
enough
to
sing
anywhere
but
at
church
.
<EOS>
My
notion
is
,
that
many
of
our
girls
nowadays
want
lessons
not
to
sing
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
had
my
lessons
in
that
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
looking
at
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
Lady
Pentreath
is
on
my
side
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
While
she
was
speaking
,
Sir
Hugo
entered
with
some
of
the
other
gentlemen
,
including
Grandcourt
,
and
standing
against
the
group
at
the
low
tea
-
table
<EOS>
said
    
"
What
imposition
is
Deronda
putting
on
you
,
ladies
 
slipping
in
among
you
by
himself
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wanting
to
pass
off
an
obscurity
on
us
as
better
than
any
celebrity
,
"
said
Lady
Pentreath
 
"
a
pretty
singing
Jewess
who
is
to
astonish
these
young
people
.
<EOS>
You
and
I
,
who
heard
Catalani
in
her
prime
,
are
not
so
easily
astonished
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
listened
with
his
good
-
humored
smile
as
he
took
a
cup
of
tea
from
his
wife
,
and
then
said
,
"
Well
,
you
know
,
a
Liberal
is
bound
to
think
that
there
have
been
singers
since
Catalani
's
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
you
are
younger
than
I
am
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
you
are
one
of
the
men
who
ran
after
Alcharisi
.
<EOS>
But
she
married
off
and
left
you
all
in
the
lurch
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
;
it
's
rather
too
bad
when
these
great
singers
marry
themselves
into
silence
before
they
have
a
crack
in
their
voices
.
<EOS>
And
the
husband
is
a
public
robber
.
<EOS>
I
remember
Leroux
saying
,
'
A
man
might
as
well
take
down
a
fine
peal
of
church
bells
and
carry
them
off
to
the
steppes
,
"
said
Sir
Hugo
,
setting
down
his
cup
and
turning
away
,
while
Deronda
,
who
had
moved
from
his
place
to
make
room
for
others
,
and
felt
that
he
was
not
in
request
,
sat
down
a
little
apart
.
<EOS>
Presently
he
became
aware
that
,
in
the
general
dispersion
of
the
group
,
Gwendolen
had
extricated
herself
from
the
attentions
of
Mr.
Vandernoodt
and
had
walked
to
the
piano
,
where
she
stood
apparently
examining
the
music
which
lay
on
the
desk
.
<EOS>
Will
any
one
be
surprised
at
Deronda
's
concluding
that
she
wished
him
to
join
her
?
<EOS>
Perhaps
she
wanted
to
make
amends
for
the
unpleasant
tone
of
resistance
with
which
she
had
met
his
recommendation
of
Mirah
,
for
he
had
noticed
that
her
first
impulse
often
was
to
say
what
she
afterward
wished
to
retract
.
<EOS>
He
went
to
her
side
and
said
    
"
Are
you
relenting
about
the
music
and
looking
for
something
to
play
or
sing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
looking
for
anything
,
but
I
_
am
_
relenting
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
speaking
in
a
submissive
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
know
the
reason
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
hear
Miss
Lapidoth
and
have
lessons
from
her
,
since
you
admire
her
so
much
,
 
that
is
,
of
course
,
when
we
go
to
town
.
<EOS>
I
mean
lessons
in
rejoicing
at
her
excellence
and
my
own
deficiency
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
turning
on
him
a
sweet
,
open
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
really
glad
for
you
to
see
and
hear
her
,
"
said
Deronda
,
returning
the
smile
in
kind
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
she
as
perfect
in
every
thing
else
as
in
her
music
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
vouch
for
that
exactly
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
seen
enough
of
her
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
seen
nothing
in
her
that
I
could
wish
to
be
different
.
<EOS>
She
has
had
an
unhappy
life
.
<EOS>
Her
troubles
began
in
early
childhood
,
and
she
has
grown
up
among
very
painful
surroundings
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
you
will
say
that
no
advantages
could
have
given
her
more
grace
and
truer
refinement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
what
sort
of
trouble
hers
were
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
any
very
precise
knowledge
.
<EOS>
But
I
know
that
she
was
on
the
brink
of
drowning
herself
in
despair
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
hindered
her
?
"
said
Gwendolen
,
quickly
,
looking
at
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
Some
ray
or
other
came
 
which
made
her
feel
that
she
ought
to
live
 
that
it
was
good
to
live
,
"
he
answered
,
quietly
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
full
of
piety
,
and
seems
capable
of
submitting
to
anything
when
it
takes
the
form
of
duty
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Those
people
are
not
to
be
pitied
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
sympathy
with
women
who
are
always
doing
right
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
in
their
great
sufferings
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
fingers
moved
quickly
among
the
edges
of
the
music
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
true
,
"
said
Deronda
,
"
that
the
consciousness
of
having
done
wrong
is
something
deeper
,
more
bitter
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
we
faulty
creatures
can
never
feel
so
much
for
the
irreproachable
as
for
those
who
are
bruised
in
the
struggle
with
their
own
faults
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
very
ancient
story
,
that
of
the
lost
sheep
 
<EOS>
but
it
comes
up
afresh
every
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
a
way
of
speaking
 
it
is
not
acted
upon
,
it
is
not
real
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
admire
Miss
Lapidoth
because
you
think
her
blameless
,
perfect
.
<EOS>
And
you
know
you
would
despise
a
woman
who
had
done
something
you
thought
very
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
would
depend
entirely
upon
her
own
view
of
what
she
had
done
,
"
said
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
be
satisfied
<EOS>
if
she
were
very
wretched
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
impetuously
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
satisfied
 
full
of
sorrow
for
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
a
mere
way
of
speaking
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
mean
to
say
that
the
finer
nature
is
not
more
adorable
;
I
meant
that
those
who
would
be
comparatively
uninteresting
beforehand
may
become
worthier
of
sympathy
when
they
do
something
that
awakens
in
them
a
keen
remorse
.
<EOS>
Lives
are
enlarged
in
different
ways
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
some
would
never
get
their
eyes
opened
if
it
were
not
for
a
violent
shock
from
the
consequences
of
their
own
actions
.
<EOS>
And
when
they
are
suffering
in
that
way
one
must
care
for
them
more
than
for
the
comfortably
self
-
satisfied
.
"
<EOS>
Deronda
forgot
everything
but
his
vision
of
what
Gwendolen
's
experience
had
probably
been
,
and
urged
by
compassion
let
his
eyes
and
voice
express
as
much
interest
as
they
would
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
had
slipped
on
to
the
music
-
stool
,
and
looked
up
at
him
with
pain
in
her
long
eyes
,
like
a
wounded
animal
asking
for
help
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
persuading
Mrs.
Grandcourt
to
play
to
us
,
Dan
?
"
said
Sir
Hugo
,
coming
up
and
putting
his
hand
on
Deronda
's
shoulder
with
a
gentle
,
admonitory
pinch
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
persuade
myself
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
rising
.
  
<EOS>
Others
had
followed
Sir
Hugo
's
lead
,
and
there
was
an
end
of
any
liability
to
confidences
for
that
day
.
<EOS>
But
the
next
was
New
Year
's
Eve
;
and
a
grand
dance
,
to
which
the
chief
tenants
were
invited
,
was
to
be
held
in
the
picture
-
gallery
above
the
cloister
 
<EOS>
the
sort
of
entertainment
in
which
numbers
and
general
movement
may
create
privacy
.
<EOS>
When
Gwendolen
was
dressing
,
she
longed
,
in
remembrance
of
Leubronn
,
to
put
on
the
old
turquoise
necklace
for
her
sole
ornament
;
but
she
dared
not
offend
her
husband
by
appearing
in
that
shabby
way
on
an
occasion
when
he
would
demand
her
utmost
splendor
.
<EOS>
Determined
to
wear
the
memorial
necklace
<EOS>
somehow
,
she
wound
it
thrice
<EOS>
round
her
wrist
and
made
a
bracelet
of
it
 
having
gone
to
her
room
to
put
it
on
just
before
the
time
of
entering
the
ball
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
always
a
beautiful
scene
,
this
dance
on
New
Year
's
Eve
,
which
had
been
kept
up
by
the
family
tradition
as
nearly
in
the
old
fashion
as
inexorable
change
would
allow
.
<EOS>
Red
carpet
was
laid
down
for
the
occasion
:
hot
-
house
plants
and
evergreens
were
arranged
in
bowers
at
the
extremities
and
in
every
recess
of
the
gallery
;
and
the
old
portraits
stretching
back
through
generations
,
even
to
the
pre
-
portraying
period
,
made
a
piquant
line
of
spectators
.
<EOS>
Some
neighboring
gentry
,
major
and
minor
,
were
invited
;
and
it
was
certainly
an
occasion
when
a
prospective
master
and
mistress
of
Abbott
's
and
King
's
Topping
might
see
their
future
glory
in
an
agreeable
light
,
as
a
picturesque
provincial
supremacy
with
a
rent
-
roll
personified
by
the
most
prosperous
-
looking
tenants
.
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
expected
Grandcourt
to
feel
flattered
by
being
asked
to
the
Abbey
at
a
time
which
included
this
festival
in
honor
of
the
family
estate
;
but
he
also
hoped
that
his
own
hale
appearance
might
impress
his
successor
with
the
probable
length
of
time
that
would
elapse
before
the
succession
came
,
and
with
the
wisdom
of
preferring
a
good
actual
sum
to
a
minor
property
that
must
be
waited
for
.
<EOS>
All
present
,
down
to
the
least
important
farmer
's
daughter
,
knew
that
they
were
to
see
"
young
Grandcourt
,
"
Sir
Hugo
's
nephew
,
the
presumptive
heir
and
future
baronet
,
now
visiting
the
Abbey
with
his
bride
after
an
absence
of
many
years
;
any
coolness
between
uncle
and
nephew
having
,
it
is
understood
,
given
way
to
a
friendly
warmth
.
<EOS>
The
bride
opening
the
ball
with
Sir
Hugo
was
necessarily
the
cynosure
of
all
eyes
;
and
less
than
a
year
before
,
if
some
magic
mirror
could
have
shown
Gwendolen
her
actual
position
,
she
would
have
imagined
herself
moving
in
it
with
a
glow
of
triumphant
pleasure
,
conscious
that
she
held
in
her
hands
a
life
full
of
favorable
chances
which
her
cleverness
and
spirit
would
enable
her
to
make
the
best
of
.
<EOS>
And
now
she
was
wondering
that
she
could
get
so
little
joy
out
of
the
exultation
to
which
she
had
been
suddenly
lifted
,
away
from
the
distasteful
petty
empire
of
her
girlhood
with
its
irksome
lack
of
distinction
and
superfluity
of
sisters
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
been
glad
to
be
even
unreasonably
elated
,
and
to
forget
everything
but
the
flattery
of
the
moment
;
but
she
was
like
one
courting
sleep
,
in
whom
thoughts
insist
like
willful
tormentors
.
  
<EOS>
Wondering
in
this
way
at
her
own
dullness
,
and
all
the
while
longing
for
an
excitement
that
would
deaden
importunate
aches
,
she
was
passing
through
files
of
admiring
beholders
in
the
country
-
dance
with
which
it
was
traditional
to
open
the
ball
,
and
was
being
generally
regarded
by
her
own
sex
as
an
enviable
woman
.
<EOS>
It
was
remarked
that
she
carried
herself
with
a
wonderful
air
,
considering
that
she
had
been
nobody
in
particular
,
and
without
a
farthing
to
her
fortune
.
<EOS>
If
she
had
been
a
duke
's
daughter
,
or
one
of
the
royal
princesses
,
she
could
not
have
taken
the
honors
of
the
evening
more
as
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
Poor
Gwendolen
!
<EOS>
It
would
by
-
and
-
by
become
a
sort
of
skill
in
which
she
was
automatically
practiced
to
hear
this
last
great
gambling
loss
with
an
air
of
perfect
self
-
possession
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
couple
that
passed
were
also
worth
looking
at
.
<EOS>
Lady
Pentreath
had
said
,
"
I
shall
stand
up
for
one
dance
,
but
I
shall
choose
my
partner
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Deronda
,
you
are
the
youngest
man
,
I
mean
to
dance
with
you
.
<EOS>
Nobody
is
old
enough
to
make
a
good
pair
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
must
have
a
contrast
.
"
<EOS>
And
the
contrast
certainly
set
off
the
old
lady
to
the
utmost
.
<EOS>
She
was
one
of
those
women
who
are
never
handsome
till
they
are
old
,
and
she
had
had
the
wisdom
to
embrace
the
beauty
of
age
as
early
as
possible
.
<EOS>
What
might
have
seemed
harshness
in
her
features
when
she
was
young
,
had
turned
now
into
a
satisfactory
strength
of
form
and
expression
which
defied
wrinkles
,
and
was
set
off
by
a
crown
of
white
hair
;
her
well
-
built
figure
was
well
covered
with
black
drapery
,
her
ears
and
neck
comfortably
caressed
with
lace
,
showing
none
of
those
withered
spaces
which
one
would
think
it
a
pitiable
condition
of
poverty
to
expose
.
<EOS>
She
glided
along
gracefully
enough
,
her
dark
eyes
still
with
a
mischievous
smile
in
them
as
she
observed
the
company
.
<EOS>
Her
partner
's
young
richness
of
tint
against
the
flattened
hues
and
rougher
forms
of
her
aged
head
had
an
effect
something
like
that
of
a
fine
flower
against
a
lichenous
branch
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
tenants
hardly
appreciated
this
pair
.
<EOS>
Lady
Pentreath
was
nothing
more
than
a
straight
,
active
old
lady
:
Mr.
Deronda
was
a
familiar
figure
regarded
with
friendliness
;
but
if
he
had
been
the
heir
,
it
would
have
been
regretted
that
his
face
was
not
as
unmistakably
English
as
Sir
Hugo
's
.
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
's
appearance
when
he
came
up
with
Lady
Mallinger
was
not
impeached
with
foreignness
:
still
the
satisfaction
in
it
was
not
complete
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
matter
of
congratulation
if
one
who
had
the
luck
to
inherit
two
old
family
estates
had
had
more
hair
,
a
fresher
color
,
and
a
look
of
greater
animation
;
but
that
fine
families
dwindled
off
into
females
,
and
estates
ran
together
into
the
single
heirship
of
a
mealy
-
complexioned
male
,
was
a
tendency
in
things
which
seemed
to
be
accounted
for
by
a
citation
of
other
instances
.
<EOS>
It
was
agreed
that
Mr.
Grandcourt
could
never
be
taken
for
anything
but
what
he
was
 
a
born
gentleman
;
and
that
,
in
fact
,
he
looked
like
an
heir
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
person
least
complacently
disposed
toward
him
at
that
moment
was
Lady
Mallinger
,
to
whom
going
in
procession
up
this
country
-
dance
with
Grandcourt
was
a
blazonment
of
herself
as
the
infelicitous
wife
who
had
produced
nothing
but
daughters
,
little
better
than
no
children
,
poor
dear
things
,
except
for
her
own
fondness
and
for
Sir
Hugo
's
wonderful
goodness
to
them
.
<EOS>
But
such
inward
discomfort
could
not
prevent
the
gentle
lady
from
looking
fair
and
stout
to
admiration
,
or
her
full
blue
eyes
from
glancing
mildly
at
her
neighbors
.
<EOS>
All
the
mothers
and
fathers
held
it
a
thousand
pities
that
she
had
not
had
a
fine
boy
,
or
even
several
 
which
might
have
been
expected
,
to
look
at
her
when
she
was
first
married
.
  
<EOS>
The
gallery
included
only
three
sides
of
the
quadrangle
,
the
fourth
being
shut
off
as
a
lobby
or
corridor
:
one
side
was
used
for
dancing
,
and
the
opposite
side
for
the
supper
-
table
,
while
the
intermediate
part
was
less
brilliantly
lit
,
and
fitted
with
comfortable
seats
.
<EOS>
Later
in
the
evening
Gwendolen
was
in
one
of
these
seats
,
and
Grandcourt
was
standing
near
her
.
<EOS>
They
were
not
talking
to
each
other
:
she
was
leaning
backward
in
her
chair
,
and
he
against
the
wall
;
and
Deronda
,
happening
to
observe
this
,
went
up
to
ask
her
if
she
had
resolved
not
to
dance
any
more
.
<EOS>
Having
himself
been
doing
hard
duty
in
this
way
among
the
guests
,
he
thought
he
had
earned
the
right
to
sink
for
a
little
while
into
the
background
,
and
he
had
spoken
little
to
Gwendolen
since
their
conversation
at
the
piano
the
day
before
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
's
presence
would
only
make
it
the
easier
to
show
that
pleasure
in
talking
to
her
even
about
trivialities
which
would
be
a
sign
of
friendliness
;
and
he
fancied
that
her
face
looked
blank
.
<EOS>
A
smile
beamed
over
it
as
she
saw
him
coming
,
and
she
raised
herself
from
her
leaning
posture
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
had
been
grumbling
at
the
_
ennui
_
of
staying
so
long
in
this
stupid
dance
,
and
proposing
that
they
should
vanish
:
she
had
resisted
on
the
ground
of
politeness
 
not
without
being
a
little
frightened
at
the
probability
that
he
was
silently
,
angry
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
her
reason
for
staying
,
though
she
had
begun
to
despair
of
the
opportunity
for
the
sake
of
which
she
had
put
the
old
necklace
on
her
wrist
.
<EOS>
But
now
at
last
Deronda
had
come
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
shall
not
dance
any
more
.
<EOS>
Are
you
not
glad
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
with
some
gayety
,
"
you
might
have
felt
obliged
humbly
to
offer
yourself
as
a
partner
,
and
I
feel
sure
you
have
danced
more
than
you
like
already
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
deny
that
,
"
said
Deronda
,
"
since
you
have
danced
as
much
as
you
like
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
will
you
take
trouble
for
me
in
another
way
,
and
fetch
me
a
glass
of
that
fresh
water
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
but
a
few
steps
that
Deronda
had
to
go
for
the
water
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
was
wrapped
in
the
lightest
,
softest
of
white
woolen
burnouses
,
under
which
her
hands
were
hidden
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
gone
she
had
drawn
off
her
glove
,
which
was
finished
with
a
lace
ruffle
,
and
when
she
put
up
her
hand
to
take
the
glass
and
lifted
it
to
her
mouth
,
the
necklace
-
bracelet
,
which
in
its
triple
winding
adapted
itself
clumsily
to
her
wrist
,
was
necessarily
conspicuous
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
saw
it
,
and
saw
that
it
was
attracting
Deronda
's
notice
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
that
hideous
thing
you
have
got
on
your
wrist
?
"
said
the
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
?
"
said
Gwendolen
,
composedly
,
pointing
to
the
turquoises
,
while
she
still
held
the
glass
;
"
it
is
an
old
necklace
I
like
to
wear
.
<EOS>
I
lost
it
once
,
and
someone
found
it
for
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
she
gave
the
glass
again
to
Deronda
,
who
immediately
carried
it
away
,
and
on
returning
said
,
in
order
to
banish
any
consciousness
about
the
necklace
    
<EOS>
"
It
is
worth
while
for
you
to
go
and
look
out
at
one
of
the
windows
on
that
side
.
<EOS>
You
can
see
the
finest
possible
moonlight
on
the
stone
pillars
and
carving
,
and
shadows
waving
across
it
in
the
wind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
see
it
.
<EOS>
Will
you
go
?
"
said
Gwendolen
,
looking
up
at
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
He
cast
his
eyes
down
at
her
,
and
saying
,
"
No
,
Deronda
will
take
you
,
"
slowly
moved
from
his
leaning
attitude
,
and
walked
away
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
face
for
a
moment
showed
a
fleeting
vexation
:
she
resented
this
show
of
indifference
toward
her
.
<EOS>
Deronda
felt
annoyed
,
chiefly
for
her
sake
;
and
with
a
quick
sense
,
that
it
would
relieve
her
most
to
behave
as
if
nothing
peculiar
had
occurred
,
he
said
,
"
Will
you
take
my
arm
and
go
,
while
only
servants
are
there
?
"
<EOS>
He
thought
that
he
understood
well
her
action
in
drawing
his
attention
to
the
necklace
:
she
wished
him
to
infer
that
she
had
submitted
her
mind
to
rebuke
 
<EOS>
her
speech
and
manner
had
from
the
first
fluctuated
toward
that
submission
 
and
that
she
felt
no
lingering
resentment
.
<EOS>
Her
evident
confidence
in
his
interpretation
of
her
appealed
to
him
as
a
peculiar
claim
.
  
<EOS>
When
they
were
walking
together
,
Gwendolen
felt
as
if
the
annoyance
which
had
just
happened
had
removed
another
film
of
reserve
from
between
them
,
and
she
had
more
right
than
before
to
be
as
open
as
she
wished
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
speak
,
being
filled
with
the
sense
of
silent
confidence
,
until
they
were
in
front
of
the
window
looking
out
on
the
moonlit
court
.
<EOS>
A
sort
of
bower
had
been
made
round
the
window
,
turning
it
into
a
recess
.
<EOS>
Quitting
his
arm
,
she
folded
her
hands
in
her
burnous
,
and
pressed
her
brow
against
the
glass
.
<EOS>
He
moved
slightly
away
,
and
held
the
lapels
of
his
coat
with
his
thumbs
under
the
collar
as
his
manner
was
:
he
had
a
wonderful
power
of
standing
perfectly
still
,
and
in
that
position
reminded
one
sometimes
of
Dante
's
_
spiriti
magni
con
occhi
tardi
e
gravi
_
.
<EOS>
(
Doubtless
some
of
these
danced
in
their
youth
,
doubted
of
their
own
vocation
,
and
found
their
own
times
too
modern
.
)
<EOS>
He
abstained
from
remarking
on
the
scene
before
them
,
fearing
that
any
indifferent
words
might
jar
on
her
:
already
the
calm
light
and
shadow
,
the
ancient
steadfast
forms
,
and
aloofness
enough
from
those
inward
troubles
which
he
felt
sure
were
agitating
her
.
<EOS>
And
he
judged
aright
:
she
would
have
been
impatient
of
polite
conversation
.
<EOS>
The
incidents
of
the
last
minute
or
two
had
receded
behind
former
thoughts
which
she
had
imagined
herself
uttering
to
Deronda
,
which
now
urged
themselves
to
her
lips
.
<EOS>
In
a
subdued
voice
,
she
said
    
"
Suppose
I
had
gambled
again
,
and
lost
the
necklace
again
,
what
should
you
have
thought
of
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Worse
than
I
do
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
are
mistaken
about
me
.
<EOS>
You
wanted
me
not
to
do
that
 
not
to
make
my
gain
out
of
another
's
loss
in
that
way
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
done
a
great
deal
worse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
imagine
temptations
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
am
able
to
understand
what
you
mean
.
<EOS>
At
least
I
understand
self
-
reproach
.
<EOS>
"
In
spite
of
preparation
he
was
almost
alarmed
at
Gwendolen
's
precipitancy
of
confidence
toward
him
,
in
contrast
with
her
habitual
resolute
concealment
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
should
you
do
if
you
were
like
me
 
<EOS>
feeling
that
you
were
wrong
and
miserable
,
and
dreading
everything
to
come
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
seemed
that
she
was
hurrying
to
make
the
utmost
use
of
this
opportunity
to
speak
as
she
would
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
not
to
be
amended
by
doing
one
thing
only
 
<EOS>
but
many
,
"
said
Deronda
,
decisively
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
?
"
said
Gwendolen
,
hastily
,
moving
her
brow
from
the
glass
and
looking
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
looked
full
at
her
in
return
,
with
what
she
thought
was
severity
.
<EOS>
He
felt
that
it
was
not
a
moment
in
which
he
must
let
himself
be
tender
,
and
flinch
from
implying
a
hard
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
there
are
many
thoughts
and
habits
that
may
help
us
to
bear
inevitable
sorrow
.
<EOS>
Multitudes
have
to
bear
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
turned
her
brow
to
the
window
again
,
and
said
impatiently
,
"
You
must
tell
me
then
what
to
think
and
what
to
do
;
else
why
did
you
not
let
me
go
on
doing
as
I
liked
and
not
minding
?
<EOS>
If
I
had
gone
on
gambling
I
might
have
won
again
,
and
I
might
have
got
not
to
care
for
anything
else
.
<EOS>
You
would
not
let
me
do
that
.
<EOS>
Why
should
n't
I
do
as
I
like
,
and
not
mind
?
<EOS>
Other
people
do
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
Gwendolen
's
speech
expressed
nothing
very
clearly
except
her
irritation
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
you
would
ever
get
not
to
mind
,
"
said
Deronda
,
with
deep
-
toned
decision
.
<EOS>
"
If
it
were
true
that
baseness
and
cruelty
made
an
escape
from
pain
,
what
difference
would
that
make
to
people
who
ca
n't
be
quite
base
or
cruel
?
<EOS>
Idiots
escape
some
pain
;
but
you
ca
n't
be
an
idiot
.
<EOS>
Some
may
do
wrong
to
another
without
remorse
;
but
suppose
one
does
feel
remorse
?
<EOS>
I
believe
you
could
never
lead
an
injurious
life
 
<EOS>
all
reckless
lives
are
injurious
,
pestilential
 
without
feeling
remorse
.
<EOS>
"
Deronda
's
unconscious
fervor
had
gathered
as
he
went
on
:
he
was
uttering
thoughts
which
he
had
used
for
himself
in
moments
of
painful
meditation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
tell
me
what
better
I
can
do
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
insistently
.
  
<EOS>
"
Many
things
.
<EOS>
Look
on
other
lives
besides
your
own
.
<EOS>
See
what
their
troubles
are
,
and
how
they
are
borne
.
<EOS>
Try
to
care
about
something
in
this
vast
world
besides
the
gratification
of
small
selfish
desires
.
<EOS>
Try
to
care
for
what
is
best
in
thought
and
action
 
something
that
is
good
apart
from
the
accidents
of
your
own
lot
.
"
  
<EOS>
For
an
instant
or
two
Gwendolen
was
mute
.
<EOS>
Then
,
again
moving
her
brow
from
the
glass
,
she
said
    
"
You
mean
that
I
am
selfish
and
ignorant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
met
her
fixed
look
in
silence
before
he
answered
firmly
 
"
You
will
not
go
on
being
selfish
and
ignorant
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
did
not
turn
away
her
glance
or
let
her
eyelids
fall
,
but
a
change
came
over
her
face
 
that
subtle
change
in
nerve
and
muscle
which
will
sometimes
give
a
childlike
expression
even
to
the
elderly
:
it
is
the
subsidence
of
self
-
assertion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
lead
you
back
?
"
said
Deronda
,
gently
,
turning
and
offering
her
his
arm
again
.
<EOS>
She
took
it
silently
,
and
in
that
way
they
came
in
sight
of
Grandcourt
,
who
was
walking
slowly
near
their
former
place
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
went
up
to
him
and
said
,
"
I
am
ready
to
go
now
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Deronda
will
excuse
us
to
Lady
Mallinger
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Certainly
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lord
and
Lady
Pentreath
disappeared
some
time
ago
.
"
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
gave
his
arm
in
silent
compliance
,
nodding
over
his
shoulder
to
Deronda
,
and
Gwendolen
too
only
half
<EOS>
turned
to
bow
and
say
,
"
<EOS>
Thanks
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
husband
and
wife
left
the
gallery
and
paced
the
corridors
in
silence
.
<EOS>
When
the
door
had
closed
on
them
in
the
boudoir
,
Grandcourt
threw
himself
into
a
chair
and
said
,
with
undertoned
peremptoriness
,
"
Sit
down
.
<EOS>
"
She
,
already
in
the
expectation
of
something
unpleasant
,
had
thrown
off
her
burnous
with
nervous
unconsciousness
,
and
immediately
obeyed
.
<EOS>
Turning
his
eyes
toward
her
,
he
began
    
"
Oblige
me
in
future
by
not
showing
whims
like
a
mad
woman
in
a
play
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
said
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
there
is
some
understanding
between
you
and
Deronda
about
that
thing
you
have
on
your
wrist
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
anything
to
say
to
him
,
say
it
.
<EOS>
But
do
n't
carry
on
a
telegraphing
which
other
people
are
supposed
not
to
see
.
<EOS>
It
's
damnably
vulgar
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
know
all
about
the
necklace
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
her
angry
pride
resisting
the
nightmare
of
fear
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
to
know
.
<EOS>
Keep
to
yourself
whatever
you
like
.
"
<EOS>
Grandcourt
paused
between
each
sentence
,
and
in
each
his
speech
seemed
to
become
more
preternaturally
distinct
in
its
inward
tones
.
<EOS>
"
What
I
care
to
know
I
shall
know
without
your
telling
me
.
<EOS>
Only
you
will
please
to
behave
as
becomes
my
wife
.
<EOS>
And
not
make
a
spectacle
of
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
object
to
my
talking
to
Mr.
Deronda
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
two
straws
about
Deronda
,
or
any
other
conceited
hanger
-
on
.
<EOS>
You
may
talk
to
him
as
much
as
you
like
.
<EOS>
He
is
not
going
to
take
my
place
.
<EOS>
You
are
my
wife
.
<EOS>
And
you
will
either
fill
your
place
properly
 
to
the
world
and
to
me
 
or
you
will
go
to
the
devil
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
intended
anything
but
to
fill
my
place
properly
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
with
bitterest
mortification
in
her
soul
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
put
that
thing
on
your
wrist
,
and
hid
it
from
me
till
you
wanted
him
to
see
it
.
<EOS>
Only
fools
go
into
that
deaf
and
dumb
talk
,
and
think
they
're
secret
.
<EOS>
You
will
understand
that
you
are
not
to
compromise
yourself
.
<EOS>
Behave
with
dignity
.
<EOS>
That
's
all
I
have
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
With
that
last
word
Grandcourt
rose
,
turned
his
back
to
the
fire
and
looked
down
on
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
mute
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
reproach
that
she
dared
to
fling
back
at
him
in
return
for
these
insulting
admonitions
,
and
the
very
reason
she
felt
them
to
be
insulting
was
that
their
purport
went
with
the
most
absolute
dictate
of
her
pride
.
<EOS>
What
she
would
least
like
to
incur
was
the
making
a
fool
of
herself
and
being
compromised
.
<EOS>
It
was
futile
and
irrelevant
to
try
and
explain
that
Deronda
too
had
only
been
a
monitor
 
the
strongest
of
all
monitors
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
was
contemptuous
,
not
jealous
;
contemptuously
certain
of
all
the
subjection
he
cared
for
.
<EOS>
Why
could
she
not
rebel
and
defy
him
?
<EOS>
She
longed
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
But
she
might
as
well
have
tried
to
defy
the
texture
of
her
nerves
and
the
palpitation
of
her
heart
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
had
a
ghostly
army
at
his
back
,
that
could
close
round
her
wherever
she
might
turn
.
<EOS>
She
sat
in
her
splendid
attire
,
like
a
white
image
of
helplessness
,
and
he
seemed
to
gratify
himself
with
looking
at
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
even
make
a
passionate
exclamation
,
or
throw
up
her
arms
,
as
she
would
have
done
in
her
maiden
days
.
<EOS>
The
sense
of
his
scorn
kept
her
still
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
ring
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
after
what
seemed
to
her
a
long
while
.
<EOS>
She
moved
her
head
in
assent
,
and
after
ringing
he
went
to
his
dressing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
Certain
words
were
gnawing
within
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
wrong
you
have
done
me
will
be
your
own
curse
.
"
<EOS>
As
he
closed
the
door
,
the
bitter
tears
rose
,
and
the
gnawing
words
provoked
an
answer
:
"
Why
did
you
put
your
fangs
into
me
and
not
into
him
?
<EOS>
"
It
was
uttered
in
a
whisper
,
as
the
tears
came
up
silently
.
<EOS>
But
she
immediately
pressed
her
handkerchief
against
her
eyes
,
and
checked
her
tendency
to
sob
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
day
,
recovered
from
the
shuddering
fit
of
this
evening
scene
,
she
determined
to
use
the
charter
which
Grandcourt
had
scornfully
given
her
,
and
to
talk
as
much
as
she
liked
with
Deronda
;
but
no
opportunities
occurred
,
and
any
little
devices
she
could
imagine
for
creating
them
were
rejected
by
her
pride
,
which
was
now
doubly
active
.
<EOS>
Not
toward
Deronda
himself
 
she
was
singularly
free
from
alarm
lest
he
should
think
her
openness
wanting
in
dignity
<EOS>
:
it
was
part
of
his
power
over
her
that
she
believed
him
free
from
all
misunderstanding
as
to
the
way
in
which
she
appealed
to
him
;
or
rather
,
that
he
should
misunderstand
her
had
never
entered
into
her
mind
.
<EOS>
But
the
last
morning
came
,
and
still
she
had
never
been
able
to
take
up
the
dropped
thread
of
their
talk
,
and
she
was
without
devices
.
<EOS>
She
and
Grandcourt
were
to
leave
at
three
o'clock
.
<EOS>
It
was
too
irritating
that
after
a
walk
in
the
grounds
had
been
planned
in
Deronda
's
hearing
,
he
did
not
present
himself
to
join
in
it
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
was
gone
with
Sir
Hugo
to
King
's
Topping
,
to
see
the
old
manor
-
house
;
others
of
the
gentlemen
were
shooting
;
she
was
condemned
to
go
and
see
the
decoy
and
the
waterfowl
,
and
everything
else
that
she
least
wanted
to
see
,
with
the
ladies
,
with
old
Lord
Pentreath
and
his
anecdotes
,
with
Mr.
Vandernoodt
and
his
admiring
manners
.
<EOS>
The
irritation
became
too
strong
for
her
;
without
premeditation
,
she
took
advantage
of
the
winding
road
to
linger
a
little
out
of
sight
,
and
then
set
off
back
to
the
house
,
almost
running
when
she
was
safe
from
observation
.
<EOS>
She
entered
by
a
side
door
,
and
the
library
was
on
her
left
hand
;
Deronda
,
she
knew
,
was
often
there
;
why
might
she
not
turn
in
there
as
well
as
into
any
other
room
in
the
house
?
<EOS>
She
had
been
taken
there
expressly
to
see
the
illuminated
family
tree
,
and
other
remarkable
things
 
<EOS>
what
more
natural
than
that
she
should
like
to
look
in
again
?
<EOS>
The
thing
most
to
be
feared
was
that
the
room
would
be
empty
of
Deronda
,
for
the
door
was
ajar
.
<EOS>
She
pushed
it
gently
,
and
looked
round
it
.
<EOS>
He
was
there
,
writing
busily
at
a
distant
table
,
with
his
back
toward
the
door
(
in
fact
,
Sir
Hugo
had
asked
him
to
answer
some
constituents
'
letters
which
had
become
pressing
)
.
<EOS>
An
enormous
log
fire
,
with
the
scent
of
Russia
from
the
books
,
made
the
great
room
as
warmly
odorous
as
a
private
chapel
in
which
the
censors
have
been
swinging
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
too
daring
to
go
in
 
too
rude
to
speak
and
interrupt
him
;
yet
she
went
in
on
the
noiseless
carpet
,
and
stood
still
for
two
or
three
minutes
,
till
Deronda
,
having
finished
a
letter
,
pushed
it
aside
for
signature
,
and
threw
himself
back
to
consider
whether
there
were
anything
else
for
him
to
do
,
or
whether
he
could
walk
out
for
the
chance
of
meeting
the
party
which
included
Gwendolen
,
when
he
heard
her
voice
saying
,
"
Mr.
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
certainly
startling
.
<EOS>
He
rose
hastily
,
turned
round
,
and
pushed
away
his
chair
with
a
strong
expression
of
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
Am
I
wrong
to
come
in
?
"
said
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
were
far
on
your
walk
,
"
said
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
turned
back
,
"
said
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
intend
to
go
out
again
?
<EOS>
I
could
join
you
now
,
if
you
would
allow
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
want
to
say
something
,
and
I
ca
n't
stay
long
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
speaking
quickly
in
a
subdued
tone
,
while
she
walked
forward
and
rested
her
arms
and
muff
on
the
back
of
the
chair
he
had
pushed
away
from
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
tell
you
that
it
is
really
<EOS>
so
 
I
ca
n't
help
feeling
remorse
for
having
injured
others
.
<EOS>
That
was
what
I
meant
when
I
said
that
I
had
done
worse
than
gamble
again
and
pawn
the
necklace
again
 
something
more
injurious
,
as
you
called
it
.
<EOS>
And
I
ca
n't
alter
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
punished
,
but
I
ca
n't
alter
it
.
<EOS>
You
said
I
could
do
many
things
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
again
.
<EOS>
What
should
you
do
 
<EOS>
what
should
you
feel
if
you
were
in
my
place
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
hurried
directness
with
which
she
spoke
 
the
absence
of
all
her
little
airs
,
as
if
she
were
only
concerned
to
use
the
time
in
getting
an
answer
that
would
guide
her
,
made
her
appeal
unspeakably
touching
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
said
,
 
"
I
should
feel
something
of
what
you
feel
 
deep
sorrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
would
you
try
to
do
?
"
said
Gwendolen
,
with
urgent
quickness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Order
my
life
so
as
to
make
any
possible
amends
,
and
keep
away
from
doing
any
sort
of
injury
again
,
"
said
Deronda
,
catching
her
sense
that
the
time
for
speech
was
brief
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
I
ca
n't
 
I
ca
n't
;
I
must
go
on
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
in
a
passionate
loud
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
thrust
out
others
 
I
have
made
my
gain
out
of
their
loss
 
tried
to
make
it
 
tried
.
<EOS>
And
I
must
go
on
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
alter
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
answer
this
instantaneously
.
<EOS>
Her
words
had
confirmed
his
conjecture
,
and
the
situation
of
all
concerned
rose
in
swift
images
before
him
.
<EOS>
His
feeling
for
those
who
had
been
thrust
out
sanctioned
her
remorse
;
he
could
not
try
to
nullify
it
,
yet
his
heart
was
full
of
pity
for
her
.
<EOS>
But
as
soon
as
he
could
he
answered
 
taking
up
her
last
words
    
<EOS>
"
That
is
the
bitterest
of
all
 
to
wear
the
yoke
of
our
own
wrong
-
doing
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
submitted
to
that
as
men
submit
to
maiming
or
life
-
long
incurable
disease
?
 
and
made
the
unalterable
wrong
a
reason
for
more
effort
toward
a
good
,
that
may
do
something
to
counterbalance
the
evil
?
<EOS>
One
who
has
committed
irremediable
errors
may
be
scourged
by
that
consciousness
into
a
higher
course
than
is
common
.
<EOS>
There
are
many
examples
.
<EOS>
Feeling
what
it
is
to
have
spoiled
one
life
may
well
make
us
long
to
save
other
lives
from
being
spoiled
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
have
not
wronged
any
one
,
or
spoiled
their
lives
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
hastily
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
only
others
who
have
wronged
_
<EOS>
you
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
colored
slightly
,
but
said
immediately
 
"
I
suppose
our
keen
feeling
for
ourselves
might
end
in
giving
us
a
keen
feeling
for
others
,
if
,
when
we
are
suffering
acutely
,
we
were
to
consider
that
others
go
through
the
same
sharp
experience
.
<EOS>
That
is
a
sort
of
remorse
before
commission
.
<EOS>
Ca
n't
you
understand
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
do
 
now
,
"
said
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
were
right
 
<EOS>
I
_
am
_
selfish
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
thought
much
of
any
one
's
feelings
,
except
my
mother
's
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
been
fond
of
people
.
<EOS>
But
what
can
I
do
?
<EOS>
"
she
went
on
,
more
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
get
up
in
the
morning
and
do
what
every
one
else
does
.
<EOS>
It
is
all
like
a
dance
set
beforehand
.
<EOS>
I
seem
to
see
all
that
can
be
 
<EOS>
and
I
am
tired
and
sick
of
it
.
<EOS>
And
the
world
is
all
confusion
to
me
"
 
<EOS>
she
made
a
gesture
of
disgust
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
say
I
am
ignorant
.
<EOS>
But
what
is
the
good
of
trying
to
know
more
,
unless
life
were
worth
more
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
good
,
"
said
Deronda
promptly
,
with
a
touch
of
indignant
severity
,
which
he
was
inclined
to
encourage
as
his
own
safeguard
;
<EOS>
"
life
_
would
_
be
worth
more
to
you
:
some
real
knowledge
would
give
you
an
interest
in
the
world
beyond
the
small
drama
of
personal
desires
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
curse
of
your
life
 
forgive
me
 
of
so
many
lives
,
that
all
passion
is
spent
in
that
narrow
round
,
for
want
of
ideas
and
sympathies
to
make
a
larger
home
for
it
.
<EOS>
Is
there
any
single
occupation
of
mind
that
you
care
about
with
passionate
delight
or
even
independent
interest
?
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
paused
,
but
Gwendolen
,
looking
startled
and
thrilled
as
by
an
electric
shock
,
said
nothing
,
and
he
went
on
more
insistently
    
<EOS>
"
I
take
what
you
said
of
music
for
a
small
example
 
<EOS>
it
answers
for
all
larger
things
 
<EOS>
you
will
not
cultivate
it
for
the
sake
of
a
private
joy
in
it
.
<EOS>
What
sort
of
earth
or
heaven
would
hold
any
spiritual
wealth
in
it
for
souls
pauperized
by
inaction
?
<EOS>
If
one
firmament
has
no
stimulus
for
our
attention
and
awe
,
I
do
n't
see
how
four
would
have
it
.
<EOS>
We
should
stamp
every
possible
world
with
the
flatness
of
our
own
inanity
 
which
is
necessarily
impious
,
without
faith
or
fellowship
.
<EOS>
The
refuge
you
are
needing
from
personal
trouble
is
the
higher
,
the
religious
life
,
which
holds
an
enthusiasm
for
something
more
than
our
own
appetites
and
vanities
.
<EOS>
The
few
may
find
themselves
in
it
simply
by
an
elevation
of
feeling
;
but
for
us
who
have
to
struggle
for
our
wisdom
,
the
higher
life
must
be
a
region
in
which
the
affections
are
clad
with
knowledge
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
half
-
indignant
remonstrance
that
vibrated
in
Deronda
's
voice
came
,
as
often
happens
,
from
the
habit
of
inward
argument
with
himself
rather
than
from
severity
toward
Gwendolen
:
but
it
had
a
more
beneficial
effect
on
her
than
any
soothings
.
<EOS>
Nothing
is
feebler
than
the
indolent
rebellion
of
complaint
;
and
to
be
roused
into
self
-
judgment
is
comparative
activity
.
<EOS>
For
the
moment
she
felt
like
a
shaken
child
 
shaken
out
of
its
wailing
into
awe
,
and
she
said
humbly
    
"
I
will
try
.
<EOS>
I
will
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
both
stood
silent
for
a
minute
,
as
if
some
third
presence
had
arrested
them
,
 
for
Deronda
,
too
,
was
under
that
sense
of
pressure
which
is
apt
to
come
when
our
own
winged
words
seem
to
be
hovering
around
us
,
 
till
Gwendolen
began
again
    
<EOS>
"
You
said
affection
was
the
best
thing
,
and
I
have
hardly
any
 
none
about
me
.
<EOS>
If
I
could
,
I
would
have
mamma
;
but
that
is
impossible
.
<EOS>
Things
have
changed
to
me
so
 
in
such
a
short
time
.
<EOS>
What
I
used
not
to
like
I
long
for
now
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
am
almost
getting
fond
of
the
old
things
now
they
are
gone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
lip
trembled
.
  
<EOS>
"
Take
the
present
suffering
as
a
painful
letting
in
of
light
,
"
said
Deronda
,
more
gently
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
conscious
of
more
beyond
the
round
of
your
own
inclinations
 
you
know
more
of
the
way
in
which
your
life
presses
on
others
,
and
their
life
on
yours
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
you
could
have
escaped
the
painful
process
in
some
form
or
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
a
very
cruel
form
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
beating
her
foot
on
the
ground
with
returning
agitation
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
frightened
at
everything
.
<EOS>
I
am
frightened
at
myself
.
<EOS>
When
my
blood
is
fired
I
can
do
daring
things
 
<EOS>
take
any
leap
;
but
that
makes
me
frightened
at
myself
.
<EOS>
"
She
was
looking
at
nothing
outside
her
;
but
her
eyes
were
directed
toward
the
window
,
away
from
Deronda
,
who
,
with
quick
comprehension
said
    
"
Turn
your
fear
into
a
safeguard
.
<EOS>
Keep
your
dread
fixed
on
the
idea
of
increasing
that
remorse
which
is
so
bitter
to
you
.
<EOS>
Fixed
meditation
may
do
a
great
deal
toward
defining
our
longing
or
dread
.
<EOS>
We
are
not
always
in
a
state
of
strong
emotion
,
and
when
we
are
calm
we
can
use
our
memories
and
gradually
change
the
bias
of
our
fear
,
as
we
do
our
tastes
.
<EOS>
Take
your
fear
as
a
safeguard
.
<EOS>
It
is
like
quickness
of
hearing
.
<EOS>
It
may
make
consequences
passionately
present
to
you
.
<EOS>
Try
to
take
hold
of
your
sensibility
,
and
use
it
as
if
it
were
a
faculty
,
like
vision
.
"
<EOS>
Deronda
uttered
each
sentence
more
urgently
;
he
felt
as
if
he
were
seizing
a
faint
chance
of
rescuing
her
from
some
indefinite
danger
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
know
;
I
understand
what
you
mean
,
"
said
Gwendolen
in
her
loud
whisper
,
not
turning
her
eyes
,
but
lifting
up
her
small
gloved
hand
and
waving
it
in
deprecation
of
the
notion
that
it
was
easy
to
obey
that
advice
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
feelings
rose
 
there
are
some
feelings
 
hatred
and
anger
 
<EOS>
how
can
I
be
good
when
they
keep
rising
?
<EOS>
And
if
there
came
a
moment
when
I
felt
stifled
and
could
bear
it
no
longer
   
<EOS>
"
She
broke
off
,
and
with
agitated
lips
looked
at
Deronda
,
but
the
expression
on
his
face
pierced
her
with
an
entirely
new
feeling
.
<EOS>
He
was
under
the
baffling
difficulty
of
discerning
,
that
what
he
had
been
urging
on
her
was
thrown
into
the
pallid
distance
of
mere
thought
before
the
outburst
of
her
habitual
emotion
.
<EOS>
It
was
as
if
he
saw
her
drowning
while
his
limbs
were
bound
.
<EOS>
The
pained
compassion
which
was
spread
over
his
features
as
he
watched
her
,
affected
her
with
a
compunction
unlike
any
she
had
felt
before
,
and
in
a
changed
and
imploring
tone
she
said
    
"
I
am
grieving
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
ungrateful
.
<EOS>
You
_
can
_
help
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
think
of
everything
.
<EOS>
I
will
try
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
 
it
will
not
be
a
pain
to
you
that
I
have
dared
to
speak
of
my
trouble
to
you
?
<EOS>
You
began
it
,
you
know
,
when
you
rebuked
me
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
melancholy
smile
on
her
lips
as
she
said
that
,
but
she
added
more
entreatingly
,
"
It
will
not
be
a
pain
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
if
it
does
anything
to
save
you
from
an
evil
to
come
,
"
said
Deronda
,
with
strong
emphasis
;
"
otherwise
,
it
will
be
a
lasting
pain
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
 
<EOS>
no
 
it
shall
not
be
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
 
it
shall
be
better
with
me
because
I
have
known
you
.
"
<EOS>
She
turned
immediately
,
and
quitted
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
When
she
was
on
the
first
landing
of
the
staircase
,
Sir
Hugo
passed
across
the
hall
on
his
way
to
the
library
,
and
saw
her
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
was
not
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
,
when
the
baronet
entered
,
was
standing
in
his
ordinary
attitude
,
grasping
his
coat
-
collar
,
with
his
back
to
the
table
,
and
with
that
indefinable
expression
by
which
we
judge
that
a
man
is
still
in
the
shadow
of
a
scene
which
he
has
just
gone
through
.
<EOS>
He
moved
,
however
,
and
began
to
arrange
the
letters
.
  
<EOS>
"
Has
Mrs.
Grandcourt
been
in
here
?
"
said
Sir
Hugo
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
she
has
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
are
the
others
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
she
left
them
somewhere
in
the
grounds
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
After
a
moment
's
silence
,
in
which
Sir
Hugo
looked
at
a
letter
without
reading
it
,
he
said
"
I
hope
you
are
not
playing
with
fire
,
Dan
 
you
understand
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
I
do
,
sir
,
"
said
Deronda
,
after
a
slight
hesitation
,
which
had
some
repressed
anger
in
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
there
is
nothing
answering
to
your
metaphor
 
no
fire
,
and
therefore
no
chance
of
scorching
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
looked
searchingly
at
him
,
and
then
said
,
"
So
much
the
better
.
<EOS>
For
,
between
ourselves
,
I
fancy
there
may
be
some
hidden
gunpowder
in
that
establishment

<EOS>
I
said
I
held
a
pardon
,
not
consent
.
   
<EOS>
In
spite
of
Deronda
's
reasons
for
wishing
to
be
in
town
again
 
reasons
in
which
his
anxiety
for
Mirah
was
blent
with
curiosity
to
know
more
of
the
enigmatic
Mordecai
 
<EOS>
he
did
not
manage
to
go
up
before
Sir
Hugo
,
who
preceded
his
family
that
he
might
be
ready
for
the
opening
of
Parliament
on
the
sixth
of
February
.
<EOS>
Deronda
took
up
his
quarters
in
Park
Lane
,
aware
that
his
chambers
were
sufficiently
tenanted
by
Hans
Meyrick
.
<EOS>
This
was
what
he
expected
;
but
he
found
other
things
not
altogether
according
to
his
expectations
.
  
<EOS>
Most
of
us
remember
Retzsch
's
drawing
of
destiny
in
the
shape
of
Mephistopheles
playing
at
chess
with
man
for
his
soul
,
a
game
in
which
we
may
imagine
the
clever
adversary
making
a
feint
of
unintended
moves
so
as
to
set
the
beguiled
mortal
on
carrying
his
defensive
pieces
away
from
the
true
point
of
attack
.
<EOS>
The
fiend
makes
preparation
his
favorite
object
of
mockery
,
that
he
may
fatally
persuade
us
against
our
taking
out
waterproofs
when
he
is
well
aware
the
sky
is
going
to
clear
,
foreseeing
that
the
imbecile
will
turn
this
delusion
into
a
prejudice
against
waterproofs
instead
of
giving
a
closer
study
to
the
weather
-
signs
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
peculiar
test
of
a
man
's
metal
when
,
after
he
has
painfully
adjusted
himself
to
what
seems
a
wise
provision
,
he
finds
all
his
mental
precaution
a
little
beside
the
mark
,
and
his
excellent
intentions
no
better
than
miscalculated
dovetails
,
accurately
cut
from
a
wrong
starting
-
point
.
<EOS>
His
magnanimity
has
got
itself
ready
to
meet
misbehavior
,
and
finds
quite
a
different
call
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Something
of
this
kind
happened
to
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
His
first
impression
was
one
of
pure
pleasure
and
amusement
at
finding
his
sitting
-
room
transformed
into
an
_
atelier
_
strewed
with
miscellaneous
drawings
and
with
the
contents
of
two
chests
from
Rome
,
the
lower
half
of
the
windows
darkened
with
baize
,
and
the
blonde
Hans
in
his
weird
youth
as
the
presiding
genius
of
the
littered
place
 
his
hair
longer
than
of
old
,
his
face
more
whimsically
creased
,
and
his
high
voice
as
usual
getting
higher
under
the
excitement
of
rapid
talk
.
<EOS>
The
friendship
of
the
two
had
been
kept
up
warmly
since
the
memorable
Cambridge
time
,
not
only
by
correspondence
but
by
little
episodes
of
companionship
abroad
and
in
England
,
and
the
original
relation
of
confidence
on
one
side
and
indulgence
on
the
other
had
been
developed
in
practice
,
as
is
wo
nt
to
be
the
case
where
such
spiritual
borrowing
and
lending
has
been
well
begun
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
knew
you
would
like
to
see
my
casts
and
antiquities
,
"
said
Hans
,
after
the
first
hearty
greetings
and
inquiries
,
"
<EOS>
so
I
did
n't
scruple
to
unlade
my
chests
here
.
<EOS>
But
I
've
found
two
rooms
at
Chelsea
not
many
hundred
yards
from
my
mother
and
sisters
,
and
I
shall
soon
be
ready
to
hang
out
there
 
when
they
've
scraped
the
walls
and
put
in
some
new
lights
.
<EOS>
That
's
all
I
'm
waiting
for
.
<EOS>
But
you
see
I
do
n't
wait
to
begin
work
<EOS>
:
you
ca
n't
conceive
what
a
great
fellow
<EOS>
I
'm
going
to
be
.
<EOS>
The
seed
of
immortality
has
sprouted
within
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Only
a
fungoid
growth
,
I
dare
say
 
a
growing
disease
in
the
lungs
,
"
said
Deronda
,
accustomed
to
treat
Hans
in
brotherly
fashion
.
<EOS>
He
was
walking
toward
some
drawings
propped
on
the
ledge
of
his
bookcases
;
five
rapidly
-
sketched
heads
 
different
aspects
of
the
same
face
.
<EOS>
He
stood
at
a
convenient
distance
from
them
,
without
making
any
remark
.
<EOS>
Hans
,
too
,
was
silent
for
a
minute
,
took
up
his
palette
and
began
touching
the
picture
on
his
easel
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
of
them
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
full
face
looks
too
massive
;
otherwise
the
likenesses
are
good
,
"
said
Deronda
,
more
coldly
than
was
usual
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
it
is
not
too
massive
,
"
said
Hans
,
decisively
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
noted
that
.
<EOS>
There
is
always
a
little
surprise
when
one
passes
from
the
profile
to
the
full
face
.
<EOS>
But
I
shall
enlarge
her
scale
for
Berenice
.
<EOS>
I
am
making
a
Berenice
series
 
look
at
the
sketches
along
there
 
<EOS>
and
now
I
think
of
it
<EOS>
,
you
are
just
the
model
I
want
for
the
Agrippa
.
"
<EOS>
Hans
,
still
with
pencil
and
palette
in
hand
,
had
moved
to
Deronda
's
side
while
he
said
this
,
but
he
added
hastily
,
as
if
conscious
of
a
mistake
,
"
No
,
no
,
I
forgot
;
you
do
n't
like
sitting
for
your
portrait
,
confound
you
!
<EOS>
However
,
I
've
picked
up
a
capital
Titus
.
<EOS>
There
are
to
be
five
in
the
series
.
<EOS>
The
first
is
Berenice
clasping
the
knees
of
Gessius
Florus
and
beseeching
him
to
spare
her
people
;
I
've
got
that
on
the
easel
.
<EOS>
Then
,
this
,
where
she
is
standing
on
the
Xystus
with
Agrippa
,
entreating
the
people
not
to
injure
themselves
by
resistance
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Agrippa
's
legs
will
never
do
,
"
said
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
legs
are
good
realistically
,
"
said
Hans
,
his
face
creasing
drolly
;
"
public
men
are
often
shaky
about
the
legs
 
<EOS>
"
Their
legs
,
the
emblem
of
their
various
thought
,
"
as
somebody
says
in
the
"
Rehearsal
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
these
are
as
impossible
as
the
legs
of
Raphael
's
Alcibiades
,
"
said
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
they
are
good
ideally
,
"
said
Hans
.
<EOS>
"
Agrippa
's
legs
were
possibly
bad
;
I
idealize
that
and
make
them
impossibly
bad
.
<EOS>
Art
,
my
Eugenius
,
must
intensify
.
<EOS>
But
never
mind
the
legs
now
:
the
third
sketch
in
the
series
is
Berenice
exulting
in
the
prospects
of
being
Empress
of
Rome
,
when
the
news
has
come
that
Vespasian
is
declared
Emperor
and
her
lover
Titus
his
successor
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
must
put
a
scroll
in
her
mouth
,
else
people
will
not
understand
that
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
tell
that
in
a
picture
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
make
them
feel
their
ignorance
then
 
an
excellent
æsthetic
effect
.
<EOS>
The
fourth
is
,
Titus
sending
Berenice
away
from
Rome
after
she
has
shared
his
palace
for
ten
years
 
both
reluctant
,
both
sad
 
<EOS>
_
invitus
invitam
_
,
as
Suetonius
hath
it
.
<EOS>
I
've
found
a
model
for
the
Roman
brute
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
you
make
Berenice
look
fifty
?
<EOS>
She
must
have
been
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
;
a
few
mature
touches
to
show
the
lapse
of
time
.
<EOS>
Dark
-
eyed
beauty
wears
well
<EOS>
,
hers
particularly
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
here
is
the
fifth
<EOS>
:
Berenice
seated
lonely
on
the
ruins
of
Jerusalem
.
<EOS>
That
is
pure
imagination
.
<EOS>
That
is
what
ought
to
have
been
 
perhaps
was
.
<EOS>
Now
,
see
how
I
tell
a
pathetic
negative
.
<EOS>
Nobody
knows
what
became
of
her
 
that
is
finely
indicated
by
the
series
coming
to
a
close
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
sixth
picture
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
Hans
pretended
to
speak
with
a
gasping
sense
of
sublimity
,
and
drew
back
his
head
with
a
frown
,
as
if
looking
for
a
like
impression
on
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
I
break
off
in
the
Homeric
style
.
<EOS>
The
story
is
chipped
off
,
so
to
speak
,
and
passes
with
a
ragged
edge
into
nothing
 
_
le
néant
_
;
can
anything
be
more
sublime
,
especially
in
French
?
<EOS>
The
vulgar
would
desire
to
see
her
corpse
and
burial
 
<EOS>
perhaps
her
will
read
and
her
linen
distributed
.
<EOS>
But
now
come
and
look
at
this
on
the
easel
.
<EOS>
I
have
made
some
way
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
beseeching
attitude
is
really
good
,
"
said
Deronda
,
after
a
moment
's
contemplation
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
very
industrious
in
the
Christmas
holidays
;
for
I
suppose
you
have
taken
up
the
subject
since
you
came
to
London
.
<EOS>
"
Neither
of
them
had
yet
mentioned
Mirah
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Hans
,
putting
touches
to
his
picture
,
"
I
made
up
my
mind
to
the
subject
before
.
<EOS>
I
take
that
lucky
chance
for
an
augury
that
I
am
going
to
burst
on
the
world
as
a
great
painter
.
<EOS>
I
saw
a
splendid
woman
in
the
Trastevere
 
the
grandest
women
there
are
half
Jewesses
 
<EOS>
and
she
set
me
hunting
for
a
fine
situation
of
a
Jewess
at
Rome
.
<EOS>
Like
other
men
of
vast
learning
,
I
ended
by
taking
what
lay
on
the
surface
.
<EOS>
I
'll
show
you
a
sketch
of
the
Trasteverina
's
head
when
I
can
lay
my
hands
on
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
she
would
be
a
more
suitable
model
for
Berenice
,
"
said
Deronda
,
not
knowing
exactly
how
to
express
his
discontent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
bit
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
model
ought
to
be
the
most
beautiful
Jewess
in
the
world
,
and
I
have
found
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
made
yourself
sure
that
she
would
like
to
figure
in
that
character
?
<EOS>
I
should
think
no
woman
would
be
more
abhorrent
to
her
.
<EOS>
Does
she
quite
know
what
you
are
doing
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Certainly
.
<EOS>
I
got
her
to
throw
herself
precisely
into
this
attitude
.
<EOS>
Little
mother
sat
for
Gessius
Florus
,
and
Mirah
clasped
her
knees
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
Hans
went
a
little
way
off
and
looked
at
the
effect
of
his
touches
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
she
knows
nothing
about
Berenice
's
history
,
"
said
Deronda
,
feeling
more
indignation
than
he
would
have
been
able
to
justify
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
she
does
 
ladies
'
edition
.
<EOS>
Berenice
was
a
fervid
patriot
,
but
was
beguiled
by
love
and
ambition
into
attaching
herself
to
the
arch
-
enemy
of
her
people
.
<EOS>
Whence
the
Nemesis
.
<EOS>
Mirah
takes
it
as
a
tragic
parable
,
and
cries
to
think
what
the
penitent
Berenice
suffered
as
she
wandered
back
to
Jerusalem
and
sat
desolate
amidst
desolation
.
<EOS>
That
was
her
own
phrase
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
find
it
in
my
heart
to
tell
her
I
invented
that
part
of
the
story
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Show
me
your
Trasteverina
,
"
said
Deronda
,
chiefly
in
order
to
hinder
himself
from
saying
something
else
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
you
mind
turning
over
that
folio
?
"
said
Hans
.
<EOS>
"
My
studies
of
heads
are
all
there
.
<EOS>
But
they
are
in
confusion
.
<EOS>
You
will
perhaps
find
her
next
to
a
crop
-
eared
undergraduate
.
"
  
<EOS>
After
Deronda
had
been
turning
over
the
drawings
a
minute
or
two
,
he
said
    
"
These
seem
to
be
all
Cambridge
heads
and
bits
of
country
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
had
better
begin
at
the
other
end
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
you
'll
find
her
about
the
middle
.
<EOS>
I
emptied
one
folio
into
another
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
this
one
of
your
undergraduates
?
"
said
Deronda
,
holding
up
a
drawing
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
an
unusually
agreeable
face
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
that
's
a
man
named
Gascoigne
 
Rex
Gascoigne
.
<EOS>
An
uncommonly
good
fellow
;
his
upper
lip
,
too
,
is
good
.
<EOS>
I
coached
him
before
he
got
his
scholarship
.
<EOS>
He
ought
to
have
taken
honors
last
Easter
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
ill
,
and
has
had
to
stay
up
another
year
.
<EOS>
I
must
look
him
up
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
know
how
he
's
going
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Here
she
is
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Deronda
,
holding
up
a
sketch
of
the
Trasteverina
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
said
Hans
,
looking
at
it
rather
contemptuously
,
"
too
coarse
.
<EOS>
I
was
unregenerate
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
was
silent
while
he
closed
the
folio
,
leaving
the
Trasteverina
outside
.
<EOS>
Then
clasping
his
coat
-
collar
,
and
turning
toward
Hans
,
he
said
,
"
I
dare
say
my
scruples
are
excessive
,
Meyrick
,
but
I
must
ask
you
to
oblige
me
by
giving
up
this
notion
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hans
threw
himself
into
a
tragic
attitude
,
and
screamed
,
"
What
!
<EOS>
my
series
 
<EOS>
my
immortal
Berenice
series
?
<EOS>
Think
of
what
you
are
saying
,
man
 
destroying
,
as
Milton
says
,
not
a
life
but
an
immortality
.
<EOS>
Wait
before
you
,
answer
,
that
I
may
deposit
the
implements
of
my
art
and
be
ready
to
uproot
my
hair
.
"
  
<EOS>
Here
Hans
laid
down
his
pencil
and
palette
,
threw
himself
backward
into
a
great
chair
,
and
hanging
limply
over
the
side
,
shook
his
long
hair
over
his
face
,
lifted
his
hooked
fingers
on
each
side
his
head
,
and
looked
up
with
comic
terror
at
Deronda
,
who
was
obliged
to
smile
,
as
he
said
    
"
Paint
as
many
Berenices
as
you
like
,
but
I
wish
you
could
feel
with
me
 
perhaps
you
will
,
on
reflection
 
that
you
should
choose
another
model
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
said
Hans
,
standing
up
,
and
looking
serious
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
she
may
get
into
such
a
position
that
her
face
is
likely
to
be
recognized
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Meyrick
and
I
are
anxious
for
her
that
she
should
be
known
as
an
admirable
singer
.
<EOS>
It
is
right
,
and
she
wishes
it
,
that
she
should
make
herself
independent
.
<EOS>
And
she
has
excellent
chances
.
<EOS>
One
good
introduction
is
secured
already
,
and
I
am
going
to
speak
to
Klesmer
.
<EOS>
Her
face
may
come
to
be
very
well
known
,
and
 
well
,
it
is
useless
to
attempt
to
explain
,
unless
you
feel
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
believe
that
if
Mirah
saw
the
circumstances
clearly
,
she
would
strongly
object
to
being
exhibited
in
this
way
 
to
allowing
herself
to
be
used
as
a
model
for
a
heroine
of
this
sort
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
Hans
stood
with
his
thumbs
in
the
belt
of
his
blouse
,
listening
to
this
speech
,
his
face
showed
a
growing
surprise
melting
into
amusement
,
that
at
last
would
have
its
way
in
an
explosive
laugh
:
but
seeing
that
Deronda
looked
gravely
offended
,
he
checked
himself
to
say
,
"
Excuse
my
laughing
,
Deronda
.
<EOS>
You
never
gave
me
an
advantage
over
you
before
.
<EOS>
If
it
had
been
about
anything
but
my
own
pictures
,
I
should
have
swallowed
every
word
because
you
said
it
.
<EOS>
And
so
you
actually
believe
that
I
should
get
my
five
pictures
hung
on
the
line
in
a
conspicuous
position
,
and
carefully
studied
by
the
public
?
<EOS>
Zounds
,
man
!
<EOS>
cider
-
cup
and
conceit
never
gave
me
half
such
a
beautiful
dream
.
<EOS>
My
pictures
are
likely
to
remain
as
private
as
the
utmost
hypersensitiveness
could
desire
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hans
turned
to
paint
again
as
a
way
of
filling
up
awkward
pauses
.
<EOS>
Deronda
stood
perfectly
still
,
recognizing
his
mistake
as
to
publicity
,
but
also
conscious
that
his
repugnance
was
not
much
diminished
.
<EOS>
He
was
the
reverse
of
satisfied
either
with
himself
or
with
Hans
;
but
the
power
of
being
quiet
carries
a
man
well
through
moments
of
embarrassment
.
<EOS>
Hans
had
a
reverence
for
his
friend
which
made
him
feel
a
sort
of
shyness
at
Deronda
's
being
in
the
wrong
;
but
it
were
not
in
his
nature
to
give
up
anything
readily
,
though
it
were
only
a
whim
 
or
rather
,
especially
if
it
were
a
whim
,
and
he
presently
went
on
,
painting
the
while
    
"
<EOS>
But
even
supposing
I
had
a
public
rushing
after
my
pictures
as
if
they
were
a
railway
series
including
nurses
,
babies
and
bonnet
-
boxes
,
I
ca
n't
see
any
justice
in
your
objection
.
<EOS>
Every
painter
worth
remembering
has
painted
the
face
he
admired
most
,
as
often
as
he
could
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
part
of
his
soul
that
goes
out
into
his
pictures
.
<EOS>
He
diffuses
its
influence
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
He
puts
what
he
hates
into
a
caricature
.
<EOS>
He
puts
what
he
adores
into
some
sacred
,
heroic
form
.
<EOS>
If
a
man
could
paint
the
woman
he
loves
a
thousand
times
as
the
Stella
Marts
to
put
courage
into
the
sailors
on
board
a
thousand
ships
,
so
much
the
more
honor
to
her
.
<EOS>
Is
n't
that
better
than
painting
a
piece
of
staring
immodesty
and
calling
it
by
a
worshipful
name
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Every
objection
can
be
answered
if
you
take
broad
ground
enough
,
Hans
:
no
special
question
of
conduct
can
be
properly
settled
in
that
way
,
"
said
Deronda
,
with
a
touch
of
peremptoriness
.
<EOS>
"
I
might
admit
all
your
generalities
,
and
yet
be
right
in
saying
you
ought
not
to
publish
Mirah
's
face
as
a
model
for
Berenice
.
<EOS>
But
I
give
up
the
question
of
publicity
.
<EOS>
I
was
unreasonable
there
.
"
<EOS>
Deronda
hesitated
a
moment
.
"
<EOS>
Still
,
even
as
a
private
affair
,
there
might
be
good
reasons
for
your
not
indulging
yourself
too
much
in
painting
her
from
the
point
of
view
you
mention
.
<EOS>
You
must
feel
that
her
situation
at
present
is
a
very
delicate
one
;
and
until
she
is
in
more
independence
,
she
should
be
kept
as
carefully
as
a
bit
of
Venetian
glass
,
for
fear
of
shaking
her
out
of
the
safe
place
she
is
lodged
in
.
<EOS>
Are
you
quite
sure
of
your
own
discretion
?
<EOS>
Excuse
me
,
Hans
.
<EOS>
My
having
found
her
binds
me
to
watch
over
her
.
<EOS>
Do
you
understand
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perfectly
,
"
said
Hans
,
turning
his
face
into
a
good
-
humored
smile
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
the
very
justifiable
opinion
of
me
that
I
am
likely
to
shatter
all
the
glass
in
my
way
,
and
break
my
own
skull
into
the
bargain
.
<EOS>
Quite
fair
.
<EOS>
Since
I
got
into
the
scrape
of
being
born
,
everything
I
have
liked
best
has
been
a
scrape
either
for
myself
or
somebody
else
.
<EOS>
Everything
I
have
taken
to
heartily
has
somehow
turned
into
a
scrape
.
<EOS>
My
painting
is
the
last
scrape
;
and
I
shall
be
all
my
life
getting
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
You
think
now
I
shall
get
into
a
scrape
at
home
.
<EOS>
No
;
I
am
regenerate
.
<EOS>
You
think
I
must
be
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
Mirah
.
<EOS>
Quite
right
;
so
I
am
.
<EOS>
But
you
think
I
shall
scream
and
plunge
and
spoil
everything
.
<EOS>
There
you
are
mistaken
 
excusably
,
but
transcendently
mistaken
.
<EOS>
I
have
undergone
baptism
by
immersion
.
<EOS>
Awe
takes
care
of
me
.
<EOS>
Ask
the
little
mother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
reckon
a
hopeless
love
among
your
scrapes
,
then
,
"
said
Deronda
,
whose
voice
seemed
to
get
deeper
as
Hans
's
went
higher
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mean
to
call
mine
hopeless
,
"
said
Hans
,
with
provoking
coolness
,
laying
down
his
tools
,
thrusting
his
thumbs
into
his
belt
,
and
moving
away
a
little
,
as
if
to
contemplate
his
picture
more
deliberately
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
fellow
,
you
are
only
preparing
misery
for
yourself
,
"
said
Deronda
,
decisively
.
<EOS>
"
She
would
not
marry
a
Christian
,
even
if
she
loved
him
.
<EOS>
Have
you
heard
her
 
of
course
you
have
 
heard
her
speak
of
her
people
and
her
religion
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
ca
n't
last
,
"
said
Hans
.
<EOS>
"
She
will
see
no
Jew
who
is
tolerable
.
<EOS>
Every
male
of
that
race
is
insupportable
,
 
"
insupportably
advancing
"
 
his
nose
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
may
rejoin
her
family
.
<EOS>
That
is
what
she
longs
for
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
and
brother
are
probably
strict
Jews
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
turn
proselyte
,
if
she
wishes
it
,
"
said
Hans
,
with
a
shrug
and
a
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
talk
nonsense
,
Hans
.
<EOS>
I
thought
you
professed
a
serious
love
for
her
,
"
said
Deronda
,
getting
heated
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
do
.
<EOS>
You
think
it
desperate
,
but
I
do
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
;
I
ca
n't
tell
what
has
happened
.
<EOS>
We
must
be
prepared
for
surprises
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
hardly
imagine
a
greater
surprise
to
me
than
that
there
should
have
seemed
to
be
anything
in
Mirah
's
sentiments
for
you
to
found
a
romantic
hope
on
.
"
<EOS>
Deronda
felt
that
he
was
too
contemptuous
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
found
my
romantic
hopes
on
a
woman
's
sentiments
,
"
said
Hans
,
perversely
inclined
to
be
the
merrier
when
he
was
addressed
with
gravity
.
<EOS>
"
I
go
to
science
and
philosophy
for
my
romance
.
<EOS>
Nature
designed
Mirah
to
fall
in
love
with
me
.
<EOS>
The
amalgamation
of
races
demands
it
 
the
mitigation
of
human
ugliness
demands
it
 
<EOS>
the
affinity
of
contrasts
assures
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
the
utmost
contrast
to
Mirah
 
a
bleached
Christian
,
who
ca
n't
sing
two
notes
in
tune
.
<EOS>
Who
has
a
chance
against
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
now
;
it
was
all
_
persiflage
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
mean
a
word
you
say
,
Meyrick
,
"
said
Deronda
,
laying
his
hand
on
Meyrick
's
shoulder
,
and
speaking
in
a
tone
of
cordial
relief
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
a
wiseacre
to
answer
you
seriously
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
honor
I
do
mean
it
,
though
,
"
said
Hans
,
facing
round
and
laying
his
left
hand
on
Deronda
's
shoulder
,
so
that
their
eyes
fronted
each
other
closely
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
at
the
confessional
.
<EOS>
I
meant
to
tell
you
as
soon
as
you
came
.
<EOS>
My
mother
says
you
are
Mirah
's
guardian
,
and
she
thinks
herself
responsible
to
you
for
every
breath
that
falls
on
Mirah
in
her
house
.
<EOS>
Well
,
I
love
her
 
<EOS>
I
worship
her
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
despair
 
<EOS>
I
mean
to
deserve
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
fellow
,
you
ca
n't
do
it
,
"
said
Deronda
,
quickly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
said
,
I
mean
to
try
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
keep
your
resolve
,
Hans
.
<EOS>
You
used
to
resolve
what
you
would
do
for
your
mother
and
sisters
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
right
to
reproach
me
,
old
fellow
,
"
said
Hans
,
gently
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
am
ungenerous
,
"
said
Deronda
,
not
apologetically
,
however
.
<EOS>
"
Yet
it
ca
n't
be
ungenerous
to
warn
you
that
you
are
indulging
mad
,
Quixotic
expectations
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
will
be
hurt
but
myself
,
then
?
"
said
Hans
,
putting
out
his
lip
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
going
to
say
anything
to
her
unless
I
felt
sure
of
the
answer
.
<EOS>
I
dare
not
ask
the
oracles
:
I
prefer
a
cheerful
caliginosity
,
as
Sir
Thomas
Browne
might
say
.
<EOS>
I
would
rather
run
my
chance
there
and
lose
,
than
be
sure
of
winning
anywhere
else
.
<EOS>
And
I
do
n't
mean
to
swallow
the
poison
of
despair
,
though
you
are
disposed
to
thrust
it
on
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
giving
up
wine
,
so
let
me
get
a
little
drunk
on
hope
and
vanity
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
With
all
my
heart
,
if
it
will
do
you
any
good
,
"
said
Deronda
,
loosing
Hans
's
shoulder
,
with
a
little
push
.
<EOS>
He
made
his
tone
kindly
,
but
his
words
were
from
the
lip
only
.
<EOS>
As
to
his
real
feeling
he
was
silenced
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
conscious
of
that
peculiar
irritation
which
will
sometimes
befall
the
man
whom
others
are
inclined
to
trust
as
a
mentor
 
<EOS>
the
irritation
of
perceiving
that
he
is
supposed
to
be
entirely
off
the
same
plane
of
desire
and
temptation
as
those
who
confess
to
him
.
<EOS>
Our
guides
,
we
pretend
,
must
be
sinless
:
as
if
those
were
not
often
the
best
teachers
who
only
yesterday
got
corrected
for
their
mistakes
.
<EOS>
Throughout
their
friendship
Deronda
had
been
used
to
Hans
's
egotism
,
but
he
had
never
before
felt
intolerant
of
it
:
when
Hans
,
habitually
pouring
out
his
own
feelings
and
affairs
,
had
never
cared
for
any
detail
in
return
,
and
,
if
he
chanced
to
know
any
,
and
soon
forgotten
it
.
<EOS>
Deronda
had
been
inwardly
as
well
as
outwardly
indulgent
 
nay
,
satisfied
.
<EOS>
But
now
he
had
noted
with
some
indignation
,
all
the
stronger
because
it
must
not
be
betrayed
,
Hans
's
evident
assumption
that
for
any
danger
of
rivalry
or
jealousy
in
relation
to
Mirah
,
Deronda
was
not
as
much
out
of
the
question
as
the
angel
Gabriel
.
<EOS>
It
is
one
thing
to
be
resolute
in
placing
one
's
self
out
of
the
question
,
and
another
to
endure
that
others
should
perform
that
exclusion
for
us
.
<EOS>
He
had
expected
that
Hans
would
give
him
trouble
:
what
he
had
not
expected
was
that
the
trouble
would
have
a
strong
element
of
personal
feeling
.
<EOS>
And
he
was
rather
ashamed
that
Hans
's
hopes
caused
him
uneasiness
in
spite
of
his
well
-
warranted
conviction
that
they
would
never
be
fulfilled
.
<EOS>
They
had
raised
an
image
of
Mirah
changing
;
and
however
he
might
protest
that
the
change
would
not
happen
,
the
protest
kept
up
the
unpleasant
image
.
<EOS>
Altogether
poor
Hans
seemed
to
be
entering
into
Deronda
's
experience
in
a
disproportionate
manner
 
going
beyond
his
part
of
rescued
prodigal
,
and
rousing
a
feeling
quite
distinct
from
compassionate
affection
.
  
<EOS>
When
Deronda
went
to
Chelsea
he
was
not
made
as
comfortable
as
he
ought
to
have
been
by
Mrs.
Meyrick
's
evident
release
from
anxiety
about
the
beloved
but
incalculable
son
.
<EOS>
Mirah
seemed
livelier
than
before
,
and
for
the
first
time
he
saw
her
laugh
.
<EOS>
It
was
when
they
were
talking
of
Hans
,
he
being
naturally
the
mother
's
first
topic
.
<EOS>
Mirah
wished
to
know
if
Deronda
had
seen
Mr.
Hans
going
through
a
sort
of
character
piece
without
changing
his
dress
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
passes
from
one
figure
to
another
as
if
he
were
a
bit
of
flame
where
you
fancied
the
figures
without
seeing
them
,
"
said
Mirah
,
full
of
her
subject
;
"
he
is
so
wonderfully
quick
.
<EOS>
I
used
never
to
like
comic
things
on
the
stage
 
<EOS>
they
were
dwelt
on
too
long
;
but
all
in
one
minute
Mr.
Hans
makes
himself
a
blind
bard
,
and
then
Rienzi
addressing
the
Romans
,
and
then
an
opera
-
dancer
,
and
then
a
desponding
young
gentleman
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
for
them
all
,
and
yet
I
laugh
,
all
in
one
"
 
here
<EOS>
Mirah
gave
a
little
laugh
that
might
have
entered
into
a
song
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
hardly
thought
that
Mirah
could
laugh
till
Hans
came
,
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
seeing
that
Deronda
,
like
herself
,
was
observing
the
pretty
picture
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hans
seems
in
great
force
just
now
,
"
said
Deronda
in
a
tone
of
congratulation
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
wonder
at
his
enlivening
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
been
just
perfect
ever
since
he
came
back
,
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
keeping
to
herself
the
next
clause
 
"
if
it
will
but
last
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
great
happiness
,
"
said
Mirah
,
"
to
see
the
son
and
brother
come
into
this
dear
home
.
<EOS>
And
I
hear
them
all
talk
about
what
they
did
together
when
they
were
little
.
<EOS>
That
seems
like
heaven
,
and
to
have
a
mother
and
brother
who
talk
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
had
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
I
,
"
said
Deronda
,
involuntarily
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
?
"
said
Mirah
,
regretfully
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
had
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
had
had
every
good
.
<EOS>
"
The
last
words
were
uttered
with
a
serious
ardor
as
if
they
had
been
part
of
a
litany
,
while
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
Deronda
,
who
with
his
elbow
on
the
back
of
his
chair
was
contemplating
her
by
the
new
light
of
the
impression
she
had
made
on
Hans
,
and
the
possibility
of
her
being
attracted
by
that
extraordinary
contrast
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
more
than
what
had
happened
on
each
former
visit
of
his
,
that
Mirah
appeared
to
enjoy
speaking
of
what
she
felt
very
much
as
a
little
girl
fresh
from
school
<EOS>
pours
forth
spontaneously
all
the
long
-
repressed
chat
for
which
she
has
found
willing
ears
.
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
in
her
life
Mirah
was
among
those
whom
she
entirely
trusted
,
and
her
original
visionary
impression
that
Deronda
was
a
divinely
-
sent
messenger
hung
about
his
image
still
,
stirring
always
anew
the
disposition
to
reliance
and
openness
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
this
way
<EOS>
she
took
what
might
have
been
the
injurious
flattery
of
admiring
attention
into
which
her
helpless
dependence
had
been
suddenly
transformed
.
<EOS>
Every
one
around
her
watched
for
her
looks
and
words
,
and
the
effect
on
her
was
simply
that
of
having
passed
from
a
trifling
imprisonment
into
an
exhilarating
air
which
made
speech
and
action
a
delight
.
<EOS>
To
her
mind
it
was
all
a
gift
from
others
'
goodness
.
<EOS>
But
that
word
of
Deronda
's
implying
that
there
had
been
some
lack
in
his
life
which
might
be
compared
with
anything
she
had
known
in
hers
,
was
an
entirely
new
inlet
of
thought
about
him
.
<EOS>
After
her
first
expression
of
sorrowful
surprise
she
went
on
    
"
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Hans
said
yesterday
that
you
thought
so
much
of
others
you
hardly
wanted
anything
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
He
told
us
a
wonderful
story
of
Buddha
giving
himself
to
the
famished
tigress
to
save
her
<EOS>
and
her
little
ones
from
starving
.
<EOS>
And
he
said
you
were
like
Buddha
.
<EOS>
That
is
what
we
all
imagine
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
n't
imagine
that
,
"
said
Deronda
,
who
had
lately
been
finding
such
suppositions
rather
exasperating
.
<EOS>
"
Even
if
it
were
true
that
I
thought
so
much
of
others
,
it
would
not
follow
that
I
had
no
wants
for
myself
.
<EOS>
When
Buddha
let
the
tigress
eat
him
he
might
have
been
very
hungry
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
if
he
was
starved
he
would
not
mind
so
much
about
being
eaten
,
"
said
Mab
,
shyly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Please
do
n't
think
that
,
Mab
;
it
takes
away
the
beauty
of
the
action
,
"
said
Mirah
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
it
were
true
,
Mirah
?
"
said
the
rational
Amy
,
having
a
half
-
holiday
from
her
teaching
;
"
you
always
take
what
is
beautiful
as
if
it
were
true
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
it
is
,
"
said
Mirah
,
gently
.
<EOS>
"
If
people
have
thought
what
is
the
most
beautiful
and
the
best
thing
,
it
must
be
true
.
<EOS>
It
is
always
there
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Now
,
Mirah
,
what
do
you
mean
?
"
said
Amy
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
her
,
"
said
Deronda
,
coming
to
the
rescue
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
truth
in
thought
though
it
may
never
have
been
carried
out
in
action
.
<EOS>
It
lives
as
an
idea
.
<EOS>
Is
that
it
?
"
<EOS>
He
turned
to
Mirah
,
who
was
listening
with
a
blind
look
in
her
lovely
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
that
,
because
you
understand
me
,
but
I
can
not
quite
explain
,
"
said
Mirah
,
rather
abstractedly
 
still
searching
for
some
expression
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
_
was
_
<EOS>
it
beautiful
for
Buddha
to
let
the
tiger
eat
him
?
"
said
Amy
,
changing
her
ground
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
a
bad
pattern
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
world
would
get
full
of
fat
tigers
,
"
said
Mab
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
laughed
,
but
defended
the
myth
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
like
a
passionate
word
,
"
he
said
;
"
the
exaggeration
is
a
flash
of
fervor
.
<EOS>
It
is
an
extreme
image
of
what
is
happening
every
day
-
the
transmutation
of
self
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
can
say
what
I
mean
,
now
,
"
said
Mirah
,
who
had
not
heard
the
intermediate
talk
.
<EOS>
"
When
the
best
thing
comes
into
our
thoughts
,
it
is
like
what
my
mother
has
been
to
me
.
<EOS>
She
has
been
just
as
really
with
me
as
all
the
other
people
about
me
 
often
more
really
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
,
inwardly
wincing
under
this
illustration
,
which
brought
other
possible
realities
about
that
mother
vividly
before
him
,
presently
turned
the
conversation
by
saying
,
"
But
we
must
not
get
too
far
away
from
practical
matters
.
<EOS>
I
came
,
for
one
thing
,
to
tell
of
an
interview
I
had
yesterday
,
which
I
hope
Mirah
will
find
to
have
been
useful
to
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
with
Klesmer
,
the
great
pianist
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
?
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
with
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
"
You
think
he
will
help
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
.
<EOS>
He
is
very
much
occupied
,
but
has
promised
to
fix
a
time
for
receiving
and
hearing
Miss
Lapidoth
,
as
we
must
learn
to
call
her
<EOS>
"
 
here
Deronda
smiled
at
Mirah
 
"
If
she
consents
to
go
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
very
grateful
,
"
said
Mirah
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
wants
to
hear
me
sing
,
before
he
can
judge
whether
I
ought
to
be
helped
.
<EOS>
"
  
Deronda
was
struck
with
her
plain
sense
about
these
matters
of
practical
concern
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
not
be
at
all
trying
to
you
,
I
hope
,
if
Mrs.
Meyrick
will
kindly
go
with
you
to
Klesmer
's
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
not
at
all
trying
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
doing
that
all
my
life
 
I
mean
,
told
to
do
things
that
others
may
judge
of
me
.
<EOS>
And
I
have
gone
through
a
bad
trial
of
that
sort
.
<EOS>
I
am
prepared
to
bear
it
,
and
do
some
very
small
thing
.
<EOS>
Is
Klesmer
a
severe
man
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
peculiar
,
but
I
have
not
had
experience
enough
of
him
to
know
whether
he
would
be
what
you
would
call
severe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
he
is
kind
-
hearted
 
kind
in
action
,
if
not
in
speech
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
used
to
be
frowned
at
and
not
praised
,
"
said
Mirah
.
  
<EOS>
"
By
the
by
,
Klesmer
frowns
a
good
deal
,
"
said
Deronda
,
"
but
there
is
often
a
sort
of
smile
in
his
eyes
all
the
while
.
<EOS>
Unhappily
he
wears
spectacles
,
so
you
must
catch
him
in
the
right
light
to
see
the
smile
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
be
frightened
,
"
said
Mirah
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
were
like
a
roaring
lion
,
he
only
wants
me
to
sing
.
<EOS>
I
shall
do
what
I
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
feel
sure
you
will
not
mind
being
invited
to
sing
in
Lady
Mallinger
's
drawing
-
room
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
She
intends
to
ask
you
next
month
,
and
will
invite
many
ladies
to
hear
you
,
who
are
likely
to
want
lessons
from
you
for
their
daughters
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
fast
we
are
mounting
!
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
with
delight
.
<EOS>
"
You
never
thought
of
getting
grand
so
quickly
,
Mirah
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
little
frightened
at
being
called
Miss
Lapidoth
,
"
said
Mirah
,
coloring
with
a
new
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
"
Might
I
be
called
Cohen
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
you
,
"
said
Deronda
,
promptly
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
assure
you
,
you
must
not
be
called
Cohen
.
<EOS>
The
name
is
inadmissible
for
a
singer
.
<EOS>
This
is
one
of
the
trifles
in
which
we
must
conform
to
vulgar
prejudice
.
<EOS>
We
could
choose
some
other
name
,
however
 
such
as
singers
ordinarily
choose
 
an
Italian
or
Spanish
name
,
which
would
suit
your
_
physique
_
.
"
<EOS>
To
Deronda
just
now
the
name
Cohen
was
equivalent
to
the
ugliest
of
yellow
badges
.
  
<EOS>
Mirah
reflected
a
little
,
anxiously
,
then
said
,
"
No
.
<EOS>
If
Cohen
will
not
do
,
I
will
keep
the
name
I
have
been
called
by
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
hide
myself
.
<EOS>
I
have
friends
to
protect
me
.
<EOS>
And
now
 
if
my
father
were
very
miserable
and
wanted
help
 
no
,
"
she
said
,
looking
at
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
"
I
should
think
,
then
,
that
he
was
perhaps
crying
as
I
used
to
see
him
,
and
had
nobody
to
pity
him
,
and
I
had
hidden
myself
from
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
none
belonging
to
him
but
me
.
<EOS>
Others
that
made
friends
with
him
always
left
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Keep
to
what
you
feel
right
,
my
dear
child
,
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
_
I
_
would
not
persuade
you
to
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
"
For
her
own
part
she
had
no
patience
or
pity
for
that
father
,
and
would
have
left
him
to
his
crying
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
was
saying
to
himself
,
"
I
am
rather
base
to
be
angry
with
Hans
.
<EOS>
How
can
he
help
being
in
love
with
her
?
<EOS>
But
it
is
too
absurdly
presumptuous
for
him
even
to
frame
the
idea
of
appropriating
her
,
and
a
sort
of
blasphemy
to
suppose
that
she
could
possibly
give
herself
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
What
would
it
be
for
Daniel
Deronda
to
entertain
such
thoughts
?
<EOS>
He
was
not
one
who
could
quite
naively
introduce
himself
where
he
had
just
excluded
his
friend
,
yet
it
was
undeniable
that
what
had
just
happened
made
a
new
stage
in
his
feeling
toward
Mirah
.
<EOS>
But
apart
from
other
grounds
for
self
-
repression
,
reasons
both
definite
and
vague
made
him
shut
away
that
question
as
he
might
have
shut
up
a
half
-
opened
writing
that
would
have
carried
his
imagination
too
far
,
and
given
too
much
shape
to
presentiments
.
<EOS>
Might
there
not
come
a
disclosure
which
would
hold
the
missing
determination
of
his
course
?
<EOS>
What
did
he
really
know
about
his
origin
?
<EOS>
Strangely
in
these
latter
months
when
it
seemed
right
that
he
should
exert
his
will
in
the
choice
of
a
destination
,
the
passion
of
his
nature
had
got
more
and
more
locked
by
this
uncertainty
.
<EOS>
The
disclosure
might
bring
its
pain
,
indeed
the
likelihood
seemed
to
him
to
be
all
on
that
side
;
but
if
it
helped
him
to
make
his
life
a
sequence
which
would
take
the
form
of
duty
 
if
it
saved
him
from
having
to
make
an
arbitrary
selection
where
he
felt
no
preponderance
of
desire
?
<EOS>
Still
more
,
he
wanted
to
escape
standing
as
a
critic
outside
the
activities
of
men
,
stiffened
into
the
ridiculous
attitude
of
self
-
assigned

.
<EOS>
His
chief
tether
was
his
early
inwrought
affection
for
Sir
Hugo
,
making
him
gratefully
deferential
to
wishes
with
which
he
had
little
agreement
:
but
gratitude
had
been
sometimes
disturbed
by
doubts
which
were
near
reducing
it
to
a
fear
of
being
ungrateful
.
<EOS>
Many
of
us
complain
that
half
our
birthright
is
sharp
duty
:
Deronda
was
more
inclined
to
complain
that
he
was
robbed
of
this
half
;
yet
he
accused
himself
,
as
he
would
have
accused
another
,
of
being
weakly
self
-
conscious
and
wanting
in
resolve
.
<EOS>
He
was
the
reverse
of
that
type
painted
for
us
in
Faulconbridge
and
Edmund
of
Gloster
,
whose
coarse
ambition
for
personal
success
is
inflamed
by
a
defiance
of
accidental
disadvantages
.
<EOS>
To
Daniel
the
words
Father
and
Mother
had
the
altar
-
fire
in
them
;
and
the
thought
of
all
closest
relations
of
our
nature
held
still
something
of
the
mystic
power
which
had
made
his
neck
and
ears
burn
in
boyhood
.
<EOS>
The
average
man
may
regard
this
sensibility
on
the
question
of
birth
as
preposterous
and
hardly
credible
;
but
with
the
utmost
respect
for
his
knowledge
as
the
rock
from
which
all
other
knowledge
is
hewn
,
it
must
be
admitted
that
many
well
-
proved
facts
are
dark
to
the
average
man
,
even
concerning
the
action
of
his
own
heart
and
the
structure
of
his
own
retina
.
<EOS>
A
century
ago
he
and
all
his
forefathers
had
not
had
the
slightest
notion
of
that
electric
discharge
by
means
of
which
they
had
all
wagged
their
tongues
mistakenly
;
any
more
than
they
were
awake
to
the
secluded
anguish
of
exceptional
sensitiveness
into
which
many
a
carelessly
-
begotten
child
of
man
is
born
.
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
ferment
was
all
the
stronger
in
Deronda
's
mind
because
he
had
never
had
a
confidant
to
whom
he
could
open
himself
on
these
delicate
subjects
.
<EOS>
He
had
always
been
leaned
on
instead
of
being
invited
to
lean
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
he
had
longed
for
the
sort
of
friend
to
whom
he
might
possibly
unfold
his
experience
:
a
young
man
like
himself
who
sustained
a
private
grief
and
was
not
too
confident
about
his
own
career
;
speculative
enough
to
understand
every
moral
difficulty
,
yet
socially
susceptible
,
as
he
himself
was
,
and
having
every
outward
sign
of
equality
either
in
bodily
or
spiritual
wrestling
;
 
for
he
had
found
it
impossible
to
reciprocate
confidences
with
one
who
looked
up
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
no
expectation
of
meeting
the
friend
he
imagined
.
<EOS>
Deronda
's
was
not
one
of
those
quiveringly
-
poised
natures
that
lend
themselves
to
second
-
sight
.
        
<EOS>
There
be
who
hold
that
the
deeper
tragedy
were
a
Prometheus
Bound
not
    
_
after
_
<EOS>
but
_
<EOS>
before
_
he
had
well
got
the
celestial
fire
into
    
the
_
narthex
_
whereby
it
might
be
conveyed
to
mortals
<EOS>
:
thrust
by
    
the
Kratos
and
Bia
of
instituted
methods
into
a
solitude
of
despised
    
ideas
,
fastened
in
throbbing
helplessness
by
the
fatal
pressure
of
    
poverty
and
disease
 
a
solitude
where
many
pass
by
,
but
none
regard
.
   
<EOS>
"
Second
-
sight
"
is
a
flag
over
disputed
ground
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
matter
of
knowledge
that
there
are
persons
whose
yearnings
,
conceptions
 
nay
,
traveled
conclusions
 
continually
take
the
form
of
images
which
have
a
foreshadowing
power
;
the
deed
they
would
do
starts
up
before
them
in
complete
shape
,
making
a
coercive
type
;
the
event
they
hunger
for
or
dread
rises
into
vision
with
a
seed
-
like
growth
,
feeding
itself
fast
on
unnumbered
impressions
.
<EOS>
They
are
not
always
the
less
capable
of
the
argumentative
process
,
nor
less
sane
than
the
commonplace
calculators
of
the
market
:
sometimes
it
may
be
that
their
natures
have
manifold
openings
,
like
the
hundred
-
gated
Thebes
,
where
there
may
naturally
be
a
greater
and
more
miscellaneous
inrush
than
through
a
narrow
beadle
-
watched
portal
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
there
are
abject
specimens
of
the
visionary
,
as
there
is
a
minim
mammal
which
you
might
imprison
in
the
finger
of
your
glove
.
<EOS>
That
small
relative
of
the
elephant
has
no
harm
in
him
;
but
what
great
mental
or
social
type
is
free
from
specimens
whose
insignificance
is
both
ugly
and
noxious
?
<EOS>
One
is
afraid
to
think
of
all
that
the
genus
"
patriot
"
embraces
;
or
of
the
elbowing
there
might
be
at
the
day
of
judgment
for
those
who
ranked
as
authors
,
and
brought
volumes
either
in
their
hands
or
on
trucks
.
  
<EOS>
This
apology
for
inevitable
kinship
is
meant
to
usher
in
some
facts
about
Mordecai
,
whose
figure
had
bitten
itself
into
Deronda
's
mind
as
a
new
question
which
he
felt
an
interest
in
getting
answered
.
<EOS>
But
the
interest
was
no
more
than
a
vaguely
-
expectant
suspense
:
the
consumptive
-
looking
Jew
,
apparently
a
fervid
student
of
some
kind
,
getting
his
crust
by
a
quiet
handicraft
,
like
Spinoza
,
fitted
into
none
of
Deronda
's
anticipations
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
otherwise
with
the
effect
of
their
meeting
on
Mordecai
.
<EOS>
For
many
winters
,
while
he
had
been
conscious
of
an
ebbing
physical
life
,
and
as
widening
spiritual
loneliness
,
all
his
passionate
desire
had
concentrated
itself
in
the
yearning
for
some
young
ear
into
which
he
could
pour
his
mind
as
a
testament
,
some
soul
kindred
enough
to
accept
the
spiritual
product
of
his
own
brief
,
painful
life
,
as
a
mission
to
be
executed
.
<EOS>
It
was
remarkable
that
the
hopefulness
which
is
often
the
beneficent
illusion
of
consumptive
patients
,
was
in
Mordecai
wholly
diverted
from
the
prospect
of
bodily
recovery
and
carried
into
the
current
of
this
yearning
for
transmission
.
<EOS>
The
yearning
,
which
had
panted
upward
from
out
of
over
-
whelming
discouragements
,
had
grown
into
a
hope
 
<EOS>
the
hope
into
a
confident
belief
,
which
,
instead
of
being
checked
by
the
clear
conception
he
had
of
his
hastening
decline
,
took
rather
the
intensity
of
expectant
faith
in
a
prophecy
which
has
only
brief
space
to
get
fulfilled
in
.
  
<EOS>
Some
years
had
now
gone
since
he
had
first
begun
to
measure
men
with
a
keen
glance
,
searching
for
a
possibility
which
became
more
and
more
a
distinct
conception
.
<EOS>
Such
distinctness
as
it
had
at
first
was
reached
chiefly
by
a
method
of
contrast
:
he
wanted
to
find
a
man
who
differed
from
himself
.
<EOS>
Tracing
reasons
in
that
self
for
the
rebuffs
he
had
met
with
and
the
hindrances
that
beset
him
,
he
imagined
a
man
who
would
have
all
the
elements
necessary
for
sympathy
with
him
,
but
in
an
embodiment
unlike
his
own
:
he
must
be
a
Jew
,
intellectually
cultured
,
<EOS>
morally
fervid
 
in
all
this
a
nature
ready
to
be
plenished
from
Mordecai
's
;
but
his
face
and
frame
must
be
beautiful
and
strong
,
he
must
have
been
used
to
all
the
refinements
of
social
life
,
his
voice
must
flow
with
a
full
and
easy
current
,
his
circumstances
be
free
from
sordid
need
:
he
must
glorify
the
possibilities
of
the
Jew
,
not
sit
and
wonder
as
Mordecai
did
,
bearing
the
stamp
of
his
people
amid
the
sign
of
poverty
and
waning
breath
.
<EOS>
Sensitive
to
physical
characteristics
,
he
had
,
both
abroad
and
in
England
,
looked
at
pictures
as
well
as
men
,
and
in
a
vacant
hour
he
had
sometimes
lingered
in
the
National
Gallery
in
search
of
paintings
which
might
feed
his
hopefulness
with
grave
and
noble
types
of
the
human
form
,
such
as
might
well
belong
to
men
of
his
own
race
.
<EOS>
But
he
returned
in
disappointment
.
<EOS>
The
instances
are
scattered
but
thinly
over
the
galleries
of
Europe
,
in
which
the
fortune
or
selection
even
of
the
chief
masters
has
given
to
art
a
face
at
once
young
,
grand
,
and
beautiful
,
where
,
if
there
is
any
melancholy
,
it
is
no
feeble
passivity
,
but
enters
into
the
foreshadowed
capability
of
heroism
.
  
<EOS>
Some
observant
persons
may
perhaps
remember
his
emaciated
figure
,
and
dark
eyes
deep
in
their
sockets
,
as
he
stood
in
front
of
a
picture
that
had
touched
him
either
to
new
or
habitual
meditation
:
he
commonly
wore
a
cloth
cap
with
black
fur
round
it
,
which
no
painter
would
have
asked
him
to
take
off
.
<EOS>
But
spectators
would
be
likely
to
think
of
him
as
an
odd
-
looking
Jew
who
probably
got
money
out
of
pictures
;
and
Mordecai
,
when
he
looked
at
them
,
was
perfectly
aware
of
the
impression
he
made
.
<EOS>
Experience
had
rendered
him
morbidly
alive
to
the
effect
of
a
man
's
poverty
and
other
physical
disadvantages
in
cheapening
his
ideas
,
unless
they
are
those
of
a
Peter
the
Hermit
who
has
a
tocsin
for
the
rabble
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
too
sane
and
generous
to
attribute
his
spiritual
banishment
solely
to
the
excusable
prejudices
of
others
;
certain
incapacities
of
his
own
had
made
the
sentence
of
exclusion
;
and
hence
it
was
that
his
imagination
had
constructed
another
man
who
would
be
something
more
ample
than
the
second
soul
bestowed
,
according
to
the
notion
of
the
Cabbalists
,
to
help
out
the
insufficient
first
 
who
would
be
a
blooming
human
life
,
ready
to
incorporate
all
that
was
worthiest
in
an
existence
whose
visible
,
palpable
part
was
burning
itself
fast
away
.
<EOS>
His
inward
need
for
the
conception
of
this
expanded
,
prolonged
self
was
reflected
as
an
outward
necessity
.
<EOS>
The
thoughts
of
his
heart
(
that
ancient
phrase
best
shadows
the
truth
)
seemed
to
him
too
precious
,
too
closely
interwoven
with
the
growth
of
things
not
to
have
a
further
destiny
.
<EOS>
And
as
the
more
beautiful
,
the
stronger
,
the
more
executive
self
took
shape
in
his
mind
,
he
loved
it
beforehand
with
an
affection
half
identifying
,
half
contemplative
and
grateful
.
  
<EOS>
Mordecai
's
mind
wrought
so
constantly
in
images
,
that
his
coherent
trains
of
thought
often
resembled
the
significant
dreams
attributed
to
sleepers
by
waking
persons
in
their
most
inventive
moments
:
nay
,
they
often
resembled
genuine
dreams
in
their
way
of
breaking
off
the
passage
from
the
known
to
the
unknown
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
for
a
long
while
,
he
habitually
thought
of
the
Being
answering
to
his
need
as
one
distantly
approaching
or
turning
his
back
toward
him
,
darkly
painted
against
a
golden
sky
.
<EOS>
The
reason
of
the
golden
sky
lay
in
one
of
Mordecai
's
habits
.
<EOS>
He
was
keenly
alive
to
some
poetic
aspects
of
London
;
and
a
favorite
resort
of
his
,
when
strength
and
leisure
allowed
,
was
to
some
of
the
bridges
,
especially
about
sunrise
or
sunset
.
<EOS>
Even
when
he
was
bending
over
watch
-
wheels
and
trinkets
,
or
seated
in
a
small
upper
room
looking
out
on
dingy
bricks
and
dingy
cracked
windows
,
his
imagination
spontaneously
planted
him
on
some
spot
where
he
had
a
far
-
stretching
scene
;
his
thoughts
went
on
in
wide
spaces
;
and
whenever
he
could
,
he
tried
to
have
in
reality
the
influences
of
a
large
sky
.
<EOS>
Leaning
on
the
parapet
of
Blackfriar
's
Bridge
,
and
gazing
meditatively
,
the
breadth
and
calm
of
the
river
,
with
its
long
vista
half
hazy
,
half
luminous
,
the
grand
dim
masses
of
tall
forms
of
buildings
which
were
the
signs
of
world
-
commerce
,
the
oncoming
of
boats
and
barges
from
the
still
distance
into
sound
and
color
,
entered
into
his
mood
and
blent
themselves
indistinguishably
with
his
thinking
,
as
a
fine
symphony
to
which
we
can
hardly
be
said
to
listen
,
makes
a
medium
that
bears
up
our
spiritual
wings
.
<EOS>
Thus
it
happened
that
the
figure
representative
of
Mordecai
's
longing
was
mentally
seen
darkened
by
the
excess
of
light
in
the
aerial
background
.
<EOS>
But
in
the
inevitable
progress
of
his
imagination
toward
fuller
detail
,
he
ceased
to
see
the
figure
with
its
back
toward
him
.
<EOS>
It
began
to
advance
,
and
a
face
became
discernible
;
the
words
youth
,
beauty
,
refinement
,
Jewish
birth
,
noble
gravity
,
turned
into
hardly
individual
but
typical
form
and
color
:
gathered
from
his
memory
of
faces
seen
among
the
Jews
of
Holland
and
Bohemia
,
and
from
the
paintings
which
revived
that
memory
.
<EOS>
Reverently
let
it
be
said
of
this
mature
spiritual
need
that
it
was
akin
to
the
boy
's
and
girl
's
picturing
of
the
future
beloved
;
but
the
stirrings
of
such
young
desire
are
feeble
compared
with
the
passionate
current
of
an
ideal
life
straining
to
embody
itself
,
made
intense
by
resistance
to
imminent
dissolution
.
<EOS>
The
visionary
form
became
a
companion
and
auditor
;
keeping
a
place
not
only
in
the
waking
imagination
,
but
in
those
dreams
of
lighter
slumber
of
which
it
is
truest
to
say
,
"
I
sleep
,
but
my
heart
waketh
"
 
when
the
disturbing
trivial
story
of
yesterday
is
charged
with
the
impassioned
purpose
of
years
.
  
<EOS>
Of
late
the
urgency
of
irremediable
time
,
measured
by
the
gradual
choking
of
life
,
had
turned
Mordecai
's
trust
into
an
agitated
watch
for
the
fulfillment
that
must
be
at
hand
.
<EOS>
Was
the
bell
on
the
verge
of
tolling
,
the
sentence
about
to
be
executed
?
<EOS>
The
deliverer
's
footstep
must
be
near
 
the
deliverer
who
was
to
rescue
Mordecai
's
spiritual
travail
from
oblivion
,
and
give
it
an
abiding
-
place
in
the
best
heritage
of
his
people
.
<EOS>
An
insane
exaggeration
of
his
own
value
,
even
if
his
ideas
had
been
as
true
and
precious
as
those
of
Columbus
or
Newton
,
many
would
have
counted
this
yearning
,
taking
it
as
the
sublimer
part
for
a
man
to
say
,
"
<EOS>
If
not
I
,
then
another
,
"
and
to
hold
cheap
the
meaning
of
his
own
life
.
<EOS>
But
the
fuller
nature
desires
to
be
an
agent
,
to
create
,
and
not
merely
to
look
on
:
strong
love
hungers
to
bless
,
and
not
merely
to
behold
blessing
.
<EOS>
And
while
there
is
warmth
enough
in
the
sun
to
feed
an
energetic
life
,
there
will
still
be
men
to
feel
,
"
I
am
lord
of
this
moment
's
change
,
and
will
charge
it
with
my
soul
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
with
that
mingling
of
inconsequence
which
belongs
to
us
all
,
and
not
unhappily
,
since
it
saves
us
from
many
effects
of
mistake
,
Mordecai
's
confidence
in
the
friend
to
come
did
not
suffice
to
make
him
passive
,
and
he
tried
expedients
,
pathetically
humble
,
such
as
happened
to
be
within
his
reach
,
for
communicating
something
of
himself
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
two
years
since
he
had
taken
up
his
abode
under
Ezra
Cohen
's
roof
,
where
he
was
regarded
with
much
good
-
will
as
a
compound
of
workman
,
dominie
,
vessel
of
charity
,
inspired
idiot
,
man
of
piety
,
and
(
if
he
were
inquired
into
)
dangerous
heretic
.
<EOS>
During
that
time
little
Jacob
had
advanced
into
knickerbockers
,
and
into
that
quickness
of
apprehension
which
has
been
already
made
manifest
in
relation
to
hardware
and
exchange
.
<EOS>
He
had
also
advanced
in
attachment
to
Mordecai
,
regarding
him
as
an
inferior
,
but
liking
him
none
the
worse
,
and
taking
his
helpful
cleverness
as
he
might
have
taken
the
services
of
an
enslaved
Djinn
.
<EOS>
As
for
Mordecai
,
he
had
given
Jacob
his
first
lessons
,
and
his
habitual
tenderness
easily
turned
into
the
teacher
's
fatherhood
.
<EOS>
Though
he
was
fully
conscious
of
the
spiritual
distance
between
the
parents
and
himself
,
and
would
never
have
attempted
any
communication
to
them
from
his
peculiar
world
,
the
boy
moved
him
with
that
idealizing
affection
which
merges
the
qualities
of
the
individual
child
in
the
glory
of
childhood
and
the
possibilities
of
a
long
future
.
<EOS>
And
this
feeling
had
drawn
him
on
,
at
first
without
premeditation
,
and
afterward
with
conscious
purpose
,
to
a
sort
of
outpouring
in
the
ear
of
the
boy
which
might
have
seemed
wild
enough
to
any
excellent
man
of
business
who
overheard
it
.
<EOS>
But
none
overheard
when
Jacob
went
up
to
Mordecai
's
room
one
day
,
for
example
,
in
which
there
was
little
work
to
be
done
,
or
at
an
hour
when
the
work
was
ended
,
and
after
a
brief
lesson
in
English
reading
or
in
numeration
,
was
induced
to
remain
standing
at
his
teacher
's
knees
,
or
chose
to
jump
astride
them
,
often
to
the
patient
fatigue
of
the
wasted
limbs
.
<EOS>
The
inducement
was
perhaps
the
mending
of
a
toy
,
or
some
little
mechanical
device
in
which
Mordecai
's
well
-
practiced
finger
-
tips
had
an
exceptional
skill
;
and
with
the
boy
thus
tethered
,
he
would
begin
to
repeat
a
Hebrew
poem
of
his
own
,
into
which
years
before
he
had
poured
his
first
youthful
ardors
for
that
conception
of
a
blended
past
and
future
which
was
the
mistress
of
his
soul
,
telling
Jacob
to
say
the
words
after
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
boy
will
get
them
engraved
within
him
,
"
thought
Mordecai
;
"
it
is
a
way
of
printing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
None
readier
than
Jacob
at
this
fascinating
game
of
imitating
unintelligible
words
;
and
if
no
opposing
diversion
occurred
he
would
sometimes
carry
on
his
share
in
it
as
long
as
the
teacher
's
breath
would
last
out
.
<EOS>
For
Mordecai
threw
into
each
repetition
the
fervor
befitting
a
sacred
occasion
.
<EOS>
In
such
instances
,
Jacob
would
show
no
other
distraction
than
reaching
out
and
surveying
the
contents
of
his
pockets
;
or
drawing
down
the
skin
of
his
cheeks
to
make
his
eyes
look
awful
,
and
rolling
his
head
to
complete
the
effect
;
or
alternately
handling
his
own
nose
and
Mordecai
<EOS>
's
as
if
to
test
the
relation
of
their
masses
.
<EOS>
Under
all
this
the
fervid
reciter
would
not
pause
,
satisfied
if
the
young
organs
of
speech
would
submit
themselves
.
<EOS>
But
most
commonly
a
sudden
impulse
sent
Jacob
leaping
away
into
some
antic
or
active
amusement
,
when
,
instead
of
following
the
recitation
he
would
return
upon
the
foregoing
words
most
ready
to
his
tongue
,
and
mouth
or
gabble
,
with
a
see
-
saw
suited
to
the
action
of
his
limbs
,
a
verse
on
which
Mordecai
had
spent
some
of
his
too
scanty
heart
's
blood
.
<EOS>
Yet
he
waited
with
such
patience
as
a
prophet
needs
,
and
began
his
strange
printing
again
undiscouraged
on
the
morrow
,
saying
inwardly
    
"
My
words
may
rule
him
some
day
.
<EOS>
Their
meaning
may
flash
out
on
him
.
<EOS>
It
is
so
with
a
nation
 
after
many
days
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
Jacob
's
sense
of
power
was
increased
and
his
time
enlivened
by
a
store
of
magical
articulation
with
which
he
made
the
baby
crow
,
or
drove
the
large
cat
into
a
dark
corner
,
or
promised
himself
to
frighten
any
incidental
Christian
of
his
own
years
.
<EOS>
One
week
he
had
unfortunately
seen
a
street
mountebank
,
and
this
carried
off
his
muscular
imitativeness
in
sad
divergence
from
New
Hebrew
poetry
,
after
the
model
of
Jehuda
ha
-
Levi
.
<EOS>
Mordecai
had
arrived
at
a
fresh
passage
in
his
poem
;
for
as
soon
as
Jacob
had
got
well
used
to
one
portion
,
he
was
led
on
to
another
,
and
a
fresh
combination
of
sounds
generally
answered
better
in
keeping
him
fast
for
a
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
The
consumptive
voice
,
generally
a
strong
high
baritone
,
with
its
variously
mingling
hoarseness
,
like
a
haze
amidst
illuminations
,
and
its
occasional
incipient
gasp
had
more
than
the
usual
excitement
,
while
it
gave
forth
Hebrew
verses
with
a
meaning
something
like
this
:
      
<EOS>
"
Away
from
me
the
garment
of
forgetfulness
.
  
<EOS>
Withering
the
heart
;
  
The
oil
and
wine
from
presses
of
the
Goyim
,
  
Poisoned
with
scorn
.
  
<EOS>
Solitude
is
on
the
sides
of
Mount
Nebo
,
  
<EOS>
In
its
heart
a
tomb
:
  
<EOS>
There
the
buried
ark
and
golden
cherubim
  
Make
hidden
light
:
  
<EOS>
There
the
solemn
gaze
unchanged
,
  
<EOS>
The
wings
are
spread
unbroken
:
  
Shut
beneath
in
silent
awful
speech
  
<EOS>
The
Law
lies
graven
.
  
<EOS>
Solitude
and
darkness
are
my
covering
,
  
And
my
heart
a
tomb
;
  
Smite
and
shatter
it
,
O
Gabriel
!
  
<EOS>
Shatter
it
as
the
clay
of
the
founder
  
Around
the
golden
image
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
In
the
absorbing
enthusiasm
with
which
Mordecai
had
intoned
rather
than
spoken
this
last
invocation
,
he
was
unconscious
that
Jacob
had
ceased
to
follow
him
and
had
started
away
from
his
knees
;
but
pausing
he
saw
,
as
by
a
sudden
flash
,
that
the
lad
had
thrown
himself
on
his
hands
with
his
feet
in
the
air
,
mountebank
fashion
,
and
was
picking
up
with
his
lips
a
bright
farthing
which
was
a
favorite
among
his
pocket
treasures
.
<EOS>
This
might
have
been
reckoned
among
the
tricks
Mordecai
was
used
to
,
but
at
this
moment
it
jarred
him
horribly
,
as
if
it
had
been
a
Satanic
grin
upon
his
prayer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Child
!
child
!
"
<EOS>
he
called
out
with
a
strange
cry
that
startled
Jacob
to
his
feet
,
and
then
he
sank
backward
with
a
shudder
,
closing
his
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
?
"
said
Jacob
,
quickly
.
<EOS>
Then
,
not
getting
an
immediate
answer
,
he
pressed
Mordecai
's
knees
with
a
shaking
movement
,
in
order
to
rouse
him
.
<EOS>
Mordecai
opened
his
eyes
with
a
fierce
expression
in
them
,
leaned
forward
,
grasped
the
little
shoulders
,
and
said
in
a
quick
,
hoarse
whisper
    
"
A
curse
is
on
your
generation
,
child
.
<EOS>
They
will
open
the
mountain
and
drag
forth
the
golden
wings
and
coin
them
into
money
,
and
the
solemn
faces
they
will
break
up
into
ear
-
rings
for
wanton
women
!
<EOS>
And
they
shall
get
themselves
a
new
name
,
but
the
angel
of
ignominy
,
with
the
fiery
brand
,
shall
know
them
,
and
their
heart
shall
be
the
tomb
of
dead
desires
that
turn
their
life
to
rottenness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
aspect
and
action
of
Mordecai
were
so
new
and
mysterious
to
Jacob
 
<EOS>
they
carried
such
a
burden
of
obscure
threat
 
<EOS>
it
was
as
if
the
patient
,
indulgent
companion
had
turned
into
something
unknown
and
terrific
:
<EOS>
the
sunken
dark
eyes
and
hoarse
accents
close
to
him
,
the
thin
grappling
fingers
,
shook
Jacob
's
little
frame
into
awe
,
and
while
Mordecai
was
speaking
he
stood
trembling
with
a
sense
that
the
house
was
tumbling
in
and
they
were
not
going
to
have
dinner
any
more
.
<EOS>
But
when
the
terrible
speech
had
ended
and
the
pinch
was
relaxed
,
the
shock
resolved
itself
into
tears
;
Jacob
lifted
up
his
small
patriarchal
countenance
and
wept
aloud
.
<EOS>
This
sign
of
childish
grief
at
once
recalled
Mordecai
to
his
usual
gentle
self
:
he
was
not
able
to
speak
again
at
present
,
but
with
a
maternal
action
he
drew
the
curly
head
toward
him
and
pressed
it
tenderly
against
his
breast
.
<EOS>
On
this
Jacob
,
feeling
the
danger
well
-
nigh
over
,
howled
at
ease
,
beginning
to
imitate
his
own
performance
and
improve
upon
it
 
a
sort
of
transition
from
impulse
into
art
often
observable
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
next
day
he
undertook
to
terrify
Adelaide
Rebekah
in
like
manner
,
and
succeeded
very
well
.
  
<EOS>
But
Mordecai
suffered
a
check
which
lasted
long
,
from
the
consciousness
of
a
misapplied
agitation
;
sane
as
well
as
excitable
,
he
judged
severely
his
moments
of
aberration
into
futile
eagerness
,
and
felt
discredited
with
himself
.
<EOS>
All
the
more
his
mind
was
strained
toward
the
discernment
of
that
friend
to
come
,
with
whom
he
would
have
a
calm
certainty
of
fellowship
and
understanding
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
just
then
that
,
in
his
usual
midday
guardianship
of
the
old
book
-
shop
,
he
was
struck
by
the
appearance
of
Deronda
,
and
it
is
perhaps
comprehensible
now
why
Mordecai
's
glance
took
on
a
sudden
eager
interest
as
he
looked
at
the
new
-
comer
:
he
saw
a
face
and
frame
which
seemed
to
him
to
realize
the
long
-
conceived
type
.
<EOS>
But
the
disclaimer
of
Jewish
birth
was
for
the
moment
a
backward
thrust
of
double
severity
,
the
particular
disappointment
tending
to
shake
his
confidence
in
the
more
indefinite
expectation
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
when
he
found
Deronda
seated
at
the
Cohens
'
table
,
the
disclaimer
was
for
the
moment
nullified
:
the
first
impression
returned
with
added
force
,
seeming
to
be
guaranteed
by
this
second
meeting
under
circumstance
more
peculiar
than
the
former
;
and
in
asking
Deronda
if
he
knew
Hebrew
,
Mordecai
was
so
possessed
by
the
new
inrush
of
belief
,
that
he
had
forgotten
the
absence
of
any
other
condition
to
the
fulfillment
of
his
hopes
.
<EOS>
But
the
answering
"
No
"
struck
them
all
down
again
,
and
the
frustration
was
more
painful
than
before
.
<EOS>
After
turning
his
back
on
the
visitor
that
Sabbath
evening
,
Mordecai
went
through
days
of
a
deep
discouragement
,
like
that
of
men
on
a
doomed
ship
,
who
having
strained
their
eyes
after
a
sail
,
and
beheld
it
with
rejoicing
,
behold
it
never
advance
,
and
say
,
"
Our
sick
eyes
make
it
.
"
<EOS>
But
the
long
-
contemplated
figure
had
come
as
an
emotional
sequence
of
Mordecai
's
firmest
theoretic
convictions
;
it
had
been
wrought
from
the
imagery
of
his
most
passionate
life
;
and
it
inevitably
reappeared
 
reappeared
in
a
more
specific
self
-
asserting
form
than
ever
.
<EOS>
Deronda
had
that
sort
of
resemblance
to
the
preconceived
type
which
a
finely
individual
bust
or
portrait
has
to
the
more
generalized
copy
left
in
our
minds
after
a
long
interval
:
we
renew
our
memory
with
delight
,
but
we
hardly
know
with
how
much
correction
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
his
face
met
Mordecai
's
inward
gaze
as
it
had
always
belonged
to
the
awaited
friend
,
raying
out
,
moreover
<EOS>
,
some
of
that
influence
which
belongs
to
breathing
flesh
;
till
by
-
and
-
by
it
seemed
that
discouragement
had
turned
into
a
new
obstinacy
of
resistance
,
and
the
ever
-
recurrent
vision
had
the
force
of
an
outward
call
to
disregard
counter
-
evidence
,
and
keep
expectation
awake
.
<EOS>
It
was
Deronda
now
who
was
seen
in
the
often
painful
night
-
watches
,
when
we
are
all
liable
to
be
held
with
the
clutch
of
a
single
thought
 
whose
figure
,
never
with
its
back
turned
,
was
seen
in
moments
of
soothed
reverie
or
soothed
dozing
,
painted
on
that
golden
sky
which
was
the
doubly
blessed
symbol
of
advancing
day
and
of
approaching
rest
.
  
<EOS>
Mordecai
knew
that
the
nameless
stranger
was
to
come
and
redeem
his
ring
;
and
,
in
spite
of
contrary
chances
,
the
wish
to
see
him
again
was
growing
into
a
belief
that
he
should
see
him
.
<EOS>
In
the
January
weeks
,
he
felt
an
increasing
agitation
of
that
subdued
hidden
quality
which
hinders
nervous
people
from
any
steady
occupation
on
the
eve
of
an
anticipated
change
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
go
on
with
his
printing
of
Hebrew
on
little
Jacob
's
mind
;
or
with
his
attendance
at
a
weekly
club
,
which
was
another
effort
of
the
same
forlorn
hope
:
something
else
was
coming
.
<EOS>
The
one
thing
he
longed
for
was
to
get
as
far
as
the
river
,
which
he
could
do
but
seldom
and
with
difficulty
.
<EOS>
He
yearned
with
a
poet
's
yearning
for
the
wide
sky
,
the
far
-
reaching
vista
of
bridges
,
the
tender
and
fluctuating
lights
on
the
water
which
seems
to
breathe
with
a
life
that
can
shiver
and
mourn
,
be
comforted
and
rejoice
.

Momentous
things
happened
to
Deronda
the
very
evening
of
that
visit
to
the
small
house
at
Chelsea
,
when
there
was
the
discussion
about
Mirah
's
public
name
.
<EOS>
But
for
the
family
group
there
,
what
appeared
to
be
the
chief
sequence
connected
with
it
<EOS>
occurred
two
days
afterward
.
<EOS>
About
four
o'clock
wheels
paused
before
the
door
,
and
there
came
one
of
those
knocks
with
an
accompanying
ring
which
serve
to
magnify
the
sense
of
social
existence
in
a
region
where
the
most
enlivening
signals
are
usually
those
of
the
muffin
-
man
.
<EOS>
All
the
girls
were
at
home
,
and
the
two
rooms
were
thrown
together
to
make
space
for
Kate
's
drawing
,
as
well
as
a
great
length
of
embroidery
which
had
taken
the
place
of
the
satin
cushions
 
a
sort
of
_
pièce
de
résistance
_
in
the
courses
of
needlework
,
taken
up
by
any
clever
fingers
that
happened
to
be
at
liberty
.
<EOS>
It
stretched
across
the
front
room
picturesquely
enough
,
Mrs.
Meyrick
bending
over
it
on
one
corner
,
Mab
in
the
middle
,
and
Amy
at
the
other
end

Mirah
,
whose
performances
in
point
of
sewing
were
on
the
make
-
shift
level
of
the
tailor
-
bird
's
,
her
education
in
that
branch
having
been
much
neglected
,
was
acting
as
reader
to
the
party
,
seated
on
a
camp
-
stool
;
in
which
position
she
also
served
Kate
as
model
for
a
title
-
page
vignette
,
symbolizing
a
fair
public
absorbed
in
the
successive
volumes
of
the
family
tea
-
table
.
<EOS>
She
was
giving
forth
with
charming
distinctness
the
delightful
Essay
of
Elia
,
"
The
Praise
of
Chimney
-
Sweeps
,
"
and
all
were
smiling
over
the
"
innocent
blackness
,
"
when
the
imposing
knock
and
ring
called
their
thoughts
to
loftier
spheres
,
and
they
looked
up
in
wonderment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
;
"
can
it
be
Lady
Mallinger
?
<EOS>
Is
there
a
grand
carriage
,
Amy
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
 
only
a
hansom
cab
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
The
Prime
Minister
,
I
should
think
,
"
said
Kate
dryly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hans
says
the
greatest
man
in
London
may
get
into
a
hansom
cab
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
oh
,
oh
!
"
cried
Mab
.
<EOS>
"
Suppose
it
should
be
Lord
Russell
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
five
bright
faces
were
all
looking
amused
when
the
old
maid
-
servant
bringing
in
a
card
distractedly
left
the
parlor
-
door
open
,
and
there
was
seen
bowing
toward
Mrs.
Meyrick
a
figure
quite
unlike
that
of
the
respected
Premier
 
tall
and
physically
impressive
even
in
his
kid
and
kerseymere
,
with
massive
face
,
flamboyant
hair
,
and
gold
spectacles
:
in
fact
,
as
Mrs.
Meyrick
saw
from
the
card
,
_
Julius
Klesmer
_
.
  
<EOS>
Even
embarrassment
could
hardly
have
made
the
"
little
mother
"
awkward
,
but
quick
in
her
perceptions
she
was
at
once
aware
of
the
situation
,
and
felt
well
satisfied
that
the
great
personage
had
come
to
Mirah
instead
of
requiring
her
to
come
to
him
;
taking
it
as
a
sign
of
active
interest
.
<EOS>
But
when
he
entered
,
the
rooms
shrank
into
closets
,
the
cottage
piano
,
Mab
thought
,
seemed
a
ridiculous
toy
,
and
the
entire
family
existence
as
petty
and
private
as
an
establishment
of
mice
in
the
Tuileries
.
<EOS>
Klesmer
's
personality
,
especially
his
way
of
glancing
round
him
,
immediately
suggested
vast
areas
and
a
multitudinous
audience
,
and
probably
they
made
the
usual
scenery
of
his
consciousness
,
for
we
all
of
us
carry
on
our
thinking
in
some
habitual
locus
where
there
is
a
presence
of
other
souls
,
and
those
who
take
in
a
larger
sweep
than
their
neighbors
are
apt
to
seem
mightily
vain
and
affected
.
<EOS>
Klesmer
was
vain
,
but
not
more
so
than
many
contemporaries
of
heavy
aspect
,
whose
vanity
leaps
out
and
startles
one
like
a
spear
out
of
a
walking
-
stick
;
as
to
his
carriage
and
gestures
,
these
were
as
natural
to
him
as
the
length
of
his
fingers
;
and
the
rankest
affectation
he
could
have
shown
would
have
been
to
look
diffident
and
demure
.
<EOS>
While
his
grandiose
air
was
making
Mab
feel
herself
a
ridiculous
toy
to
match
the
cottage
piano
,
he
was
taking
in
the
details
around
him
with
a
keen
and
thoroughly
kind
sensibility
.
<EOS>
He
remembered
a
home
no
longer
than
this
on
the
outskirts
of
Bohemia
;
and
in
the
figurative
Bohemia
too
he
had
had
large
acquaintance
with
the
variety
and
romance
which
belong
to
small
incomes
.
<EOS>
He
addressed
Mrs.
Meyrick
with
the
utmost
deference
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
have
not
taken
too
great
a
freedom
.
<EOS>
Being
in
the
neighborhood
,
I
ventured
to
save
time
by
calling
.
<EOS>
Our
friend
,
Mr.
Deronda
,
mentioned
to
me
an
understanding
that
I
was
to
have
the
honor
of
becoming
acquainted
with
a
young
lady
here
 
Miss
Lapidoth
.
"
  
<EOS>
Klesmer
had
really
discerned
Mirah
in
the
first
moment
of
entering
,
but
,
with
subtle
politeness
,
he
looked
round
bowingly
at
the
three
sisters
as
if
he
were
uncertain
which
was
the
young
lady
in
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
Those
are
my
daughters
:
this
is
Miss
Lapidoth
,
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
waving
her
hand
toward
Mirah
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
said
Klesmer
,
in
a
tone
of
gratified
expectation
,
turning
a
radiant
smile
and
deep
bow
to
Mirah
,
who
,
instead
of
being
in
the
least
taken
by
surprise
,
had
a
calm
pleasure
in
her
face
.
<EOS>
She
liked
the
look
of
Klesmer
,
feeling
sure
that
he
would
scold
her
,
like
a
great
musician
and
a
kind
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
object
to
beginning
our
acquaintance
by
singing
to
me
,
"
he
added
,
aware
that
they
would
all
be
relieved
by
getting
rid
of
preliminaries
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
very
glad
.
<EOS>
It
is
good
of
you
to
be
willing
to
listen
to
me
,
"
said
Mirah
,
moving
to
the
piano
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
I
accompany
myself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
all
means
,
"
said
Klesmer
,
seating
himself
,
at
Mrs.
Meyrick
's
invitation
,
where
he
could
have
a
good
view
of
the
singer
.
<EOS>
The
acute
little
mother
would
not
have
acknowledged
the
weakness
,
but
she
really
said
to
herself
,
"
He
will
like
her
singing
better
if
he
sees
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
All
the
feminine
hearts
except
Mirah
's
were
beating
fast
with
anxiety
,
thinking
Klesmer
terrific
as
he
sat
with
his
listening
frown
on
,
and
only
daring
to
look
at
him
furtively
.
<EOS>
If
he
did
say
anything
severe
<EOS>
it
would
be
so
hard
for
them
all
.
<EOS>
They
could
only
comfort
themselves
with
thinking
that
Prince
Camaralzaman
,
who
had
heard
the
finest
things
,
preferred
Mirah
's
singing
to
any
other
:
 
also
she
appeared
to
be
doing
her
very
best
,
as
if
she
were
more
instead
of
less
at
ease
than
usual
.
  
<EOS>
The
song
she
had
chosen
was
a
fine
setting
of
some
words
selected
from
Leopardi
's
grand
Ode
to
Italy
:
      
<EOS>
"
_
O
patria
mia
,
vedo
le
mura
c
gli
archi
  
<EOS>
E
le
colonne
<EOS>
e
<EOS>
i
simula
-
cri
e
l'erme
  
<EOS>
Torridegli
avi
nostri
<EOS>
_
"
    
<EOS>
This
was
recitative
:
then
followed
      
"
_
Ma
la
gloria
 
non
vedo
_
"
    
a
mournful
melody
,
a
rhythmic
plaint
.
<EOS>
After
this
came
a
climax
of
devout
triumph
 
passing
from
the
subdued
adoration
of
a
happy
Andante
in
the
words
      
"
_
Beatissimi
voi
.
  
<EOS>
Che
offriste
<EOS>
il
petto
alle
<EOS>
nemiche
lance
  
<EOS>
Per
amor
di
costei
<EOS>
che
al
sol
<EOS>
vi
diede
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
"
    
to
the
joyous
outburst
of
an
exultant
Allegro
in
            
"
_
Oh
viva
,
oh
viva
:
  
<EOS>
Beatissimi
voi
  
<EOS>
Mentre
nel
monde
<EOS>
si
favelli
o
scriva
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
"
  
When
she
had
ended
,
Klesmer
said
after
a
moment
    
"
<EOS>
That
is
Joseph
Leo
's
music
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
he
was
my
last
master
 
at
Vienna
:
<EOS>
so
fierce
and
so
good
,
"
said
Mirah
,
with
a
melancholy
smile
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
prophesied
that
my
voice
would
not
do
for
the
stage
.
<EOS>
And
he
was
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
_
Con_tinue
,
if
you
please
,
"
said
Klesmer
,
putting
out
his
lips
and
shaking
his
long
fingers
,
while
he
went
on
with
a
smothered
articulation
quite
unintelligible
to
the
audience
.
  
<EOS>
The
three
girls
detested
him
unanimously
for
not
saying
one
word
of
praise
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Meyrick
was
a
little
alarmed
.
  
<EOS>
Mirah
,
simply
bent
on
doing
what
Klesmer
desired
,
and
imagining
that
he
would
now
like
to
hear
her
sing
some
German
,
went
through
Prince
Radzivill
's
music
to
Gretchen
's
songs
in
the
"
Faust
,
"
one
after
the
other
without
any
interrogatory
pause
.
<EOS>
When
she
had
finished
he
rose
and
walked
to
the
extremity
of
the
small
space
at
command
,
then
walked
back
to
the
piano
,
where
Mirah
had
risen
from
her
seat
and
stood
looking
toward
him
with
her
little
hands
crossed
before
her
,
meekly
awaiting
judgment
;
then
with
a
sudden
unknitting
of
his
brow
and
with
beaming
eyes
,
he
stretched
out
his
hand
and
said
abruptly
,
"
Let
us
shake
hands
:
you
are
a
musician
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mab
felt
herself
beginning
to
cry
,
and
all
the
three
girls
held
Klesmer
adorable
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Meyrick
took
a
long
breath
.
  
<EOS>
But
straightway
the
frown
came
again
,
the
long
hand
,
back
uppermost
,
was
stretched
out
in
quite
a
different
sense
to
touch
with
finger
-
tip
the
back
of
Mirah
's
,
and
with
protruded
lip
he
said
    
"
Not
for
great
tasks
.
<EOS>
No
high
roofs
.
<EOS>
We
are
no
skylarks
.
<EOS>
We
must
be
modest
.
"
<EOS>
Klesmer
paused
here
.
<EOS>
And
Mab
ceased
to
think
him
adorable
:
"
as
if
Mirah
had
shown
the
least
sign
of
conceit
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mirah
was
silent
,
knowing
that
there
was
a
specific
opinion
to
be
waited
for
,
and
Klesmer
presently
went
on
 
"
<EOS>
I
would
not
advise
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
further
your
singing
in
any
larger
space
than
a
private
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
But
you
will
do
there
.
<EOS>
And
here
in
London
that
is
one
of
the
best
careers
open
.
<EOS>
Lessons
will
follow
.
<EOS>
Will
you
come
and
sing
at
a
private
concert
at
my
house
on
Wednesday
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
shall
be
grateful
,
"
said
Mirah
,
putting
her
hands
together
devoutly
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
get
my
bread
in
that
way
than
by
anything
more
public
.
<EOS>
I
will
try
to
improve
.
<EOS>
What
should
I
work
at
most
?
"
  
<EOS>
Klesmer
made
a
preliminary
answer
in
noises
which
sounded
like
words
bitten
in
two
and
swallowed
before
they
were
half
out
,
shaking
his
fingers
the
while
,
before
he
said
,
quite
distinctly
,
"
I
shall
introduce
you
to
Astorga
:
he
is
the
foster
-
father
of
good
singing
and
will
give
you
advice
.
"
<EOS>
Then
addressing
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
he
added
,
"
Mrs.
Klesmer
will
call
before
Wednesday
,
with
your
permission
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
feel
that
to
be
a
great
kindness
,
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
sing
to
her
,
"
said
Klesmer
,
turning
again
to
Mirah
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
a
thorough
musician
,
and
has
a
soul
with
more
ears
to
it
than
you
will
often
get
in
a
musician
.
<EOS>
Your
singing
will
satisfy
her
:
      
<EOS>
"
Vor
den
Wissenden
sich
stellen
;
"
  
you
know
the
rest
?
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
"
"
Sicher
ist
's
in
alien
Fällen
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
said
Mirah
,
promptly
.
<EOS>
And
Klesmer
saying
"
Schön
!
<EOS>
"
put
out
his
hand
again
as
a
good
-
bye
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
certainly
chosen
the
most
delicate
way
of
praising
Mirah
,
and
the
Meyrick
girls
had
now
given
him
all
their
esteem
.
<EOS>
But
imagine
Mab
's
feeling
when
suddenly
fixing
his
eyes
on
her
,
he
said
decisively
,
"
That
young
lady
is
musical
,
I
see
!
"
<EOS>
She
was
a
mere
blush
and
sense
of
scorching
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Mirah
,
on
her
behalf
.
"
<EOS>
And
she
has
a
touch
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
please
,
Mirah
 
a
scramble
,
not
a
touch
,
"
said
Mab
,
in
anguish
,
with
a
horrible
fear
of
what
the
next
thing
might
be
:
this
dreadful
divining
personage
 
evidently
Satan
in
gray
trousers
 
might
order
her
to
sit
down
to
the
piano
,
and
her
heart
was
like
molten
wax
in
the
midst
of
her
.
<EOS>
But
this
was
cheap
payment
for
her
amazed
joy
when
Klesmer
said
benignantly
,
turning
to
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
"
Will
she
like
to
accompany
Miss
Lapidoth
and
hear
the
music
on
Wednesday
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
could
hardly
be
a
greater
pleasure
for
her
,
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
.
<EOS>
"
She
will
be
most
glad
and
grateful
.
"
  
<EOS>
Thereupon
Klesmer
bowed
round
to
the
three
sisters
more
grandly
than
they
had
ever
been
bowed
to
before
.
<EOS>
Altogether
it
was
an
amusing
picture
 
<EOS>
the
little
room
with
so
much
of
its
diagonal
taken
up
in
Klesmer
's
magnificent
bend
to
the
small
feminine
figures
like
images
a
little
less
than
life
-
size
,
the
grave
Holbein
faces
on
the
walls
,
as
many
as
were
not
otherwise
occupied
,
looking
hard
at
this
stranger
who
by
his
face
seemed
a
dignified
contemporary
of
their
own
,
but
whose
garments
seemed
a
deplorable
mockery
of
the
human
form
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Meyrick
could
not
help
going
out
of
the
room
with
Klesmer
and
closing
the
door
behind
her
.
<EOS>
He
understood
her
,
and
said
with
a
frowning
nod
    
<EOS>
"
She
will
do
:
if
she
does
n't
attempt
too
much
and
her
voice
holds
out
,
she
can
make
an
income
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
is
the
great
point
:
Deronda
told
me
.
<EOS>
You
are
taking
care
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
looks
like
a
good
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
an
angel
,
"
said
the
warm
-
hearted
woman
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Klesmer
,
with
a
playful
nod
;
"
she
is
a
pretty
Jewess
<EOS>
:
the
angels
must
not
get
the
credit
of
her
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
she
has
found
a
guardian
angel
,
"
he
ended
,
bowing
himself
out
in
this
amiable
way
.
  
<EOS>
The
four
young
creatures
had
looked
at
each
other
mutely
till
the
door
banged
and
Mrs.
Meyrick
re
-
entered
.
<EOS>
Then
there
was
an
explosion
.
<EOS>
Mab
clapped
her
hands
and
danced
everywhere
inconveniently
;
Mrs.
Meyrick
kissed
Mirah
and
blessed
her
;
Amy
said
emphatically
,
"
We
can
never
get
her
a
new
dress
before
Wednesday
!
"
<EOS>
and
Kate
exclaimed
,
"
Thank
heaven
<EOS>
my
table
is
not
knocked
over
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mirah
had
reseated
herself
on
the
music
-
stool
without
speaking
,
and
the
tears
were
rolling
down
her
cheeks
as
she
looked
at
her
friends
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
now
,
Mab
!
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
;
"
come
and
sit
down
reasonably
and
let
us
talk
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
let
us
talk
,
"
said
Mab
,
cordially
,
coming
back
to
her
low
seat
and
caressing
her
knees
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
beginning
to
feel
large
again
.
<EOS>
Hans
said
he
was
coming
this
afternoon
.
<EOS>
I
wish
he
had
been
here
 
only
there
would
have
been
no
room
for
him
.
<EOS>
Mirah
,
what
are
you
looking
sad
for
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
too
happy
,
"
said
Mirah
.
<EOS>
"
I
feel
so
full
of
gratitude
to
you
all
;
and
he
was
so
very
kind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
at
last
,
"
said
Mab
,
sharply
.
<EOS>
"
But
he
might
have
said
something
encouraging
sooner
.
<EOS>
I
thought
him
dreadfully
ugly
when
he
sat
frowning
,
and
only
said
,
"
_
Con_tinue
.
<EOS>
"
I
hated
him
all
the
long
way
from
the
top
of
his
hair
to
the
toe
of
his
polished
boot
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nonsense
,
Mab
;
he
has
a
splendid
profile
,
"
said
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
"
_
Now
_
,
but
not
_
then
_
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
people
to
keep
their
minds
bottled
up
for
the
sake
of
letting
them
off
with
a
pop
.
<EOS>
They
seem
to
grudge
making
you
happy
unless
they
can
make
you
miserable
beforehand
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
forgive
him
everything
,
"
said
Mab
,
with
a
magnanimous
air
,
"
but
he
has
invited
me
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
why
he
fixed
on
me
as
the
musical
one
?
<EOS>
Was
it
because
I
have
a
bulging
forehead
,
ma
,
and
peep
from
under
it
like
a
newt
from
under
a
stone
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
your
way
of
listening
to
the
singing
,
child
,
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
has
magic
spectacles
and
sees
everything
through
them
,
depend
upon
it
.
<EOS>
But
what
was
that
German
quotation
<EOS>
you
were
so
ready
with
,
Mirah
 
<EOS>
you
learned
puss
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
that
was
not
learning
,
"
said
Mirah
,
her
tearful
face
breaking
into
an
amused
smile
.
<EOS>
"
I
said
it
so
many
times
for
a
lesson
.
<EOS>
It
means
that
it
is
safer
to
do
anything
 
singing
or
anything
else
 
before
those
who
know
and
understand
all
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
was
why
you
were
not
one
bit
frightened
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Amy
.
<EOS>
"
But
now
,
what
we
have
to
talk
about
is
a
dress
for
you
on
Wednesday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
anything
better
than
this
black
merino
,
"
said
Mirah
,
rising
to
show
the
effect
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Some
white
gloves
and
some
new
_
bottines
_
.
<EOS>
"
She
put
out
her
little
foot
,
clad
in
the
famous
felt
slipper
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
comes
Hans
,
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
.
<EOS>
"
Stand
still
,
and
let
us
hear
what
he
says
about
the
dress
.
<EOS>
Artists
are
the
best
people
to
consult
about
such
things
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
consult
me
,
ma
,
"
said
Kate
,
lifting
up
her
eyebrow
with
a
playful
complainingness
.
<EOS>
"
I
notice
mothers
are
like
the
people
I
deal
with
 
<EOS>
the
girls
'
doings
are
always
priced
low
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
child
,
the
boys
are
such
a
trouble
 
we
could
never
put
up
with
them
,
if
we
did
n't
make
believe
they
were
worth
more
,
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
just
as
her
boy
entered
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hans
,
we
want
your
opinion
about
Mirah
's
dress
.
<EOS>
A
great
event
has
happened
.
<EOS>
Klesmer
has
been
here
,
and
she
is
going
to
sing
at
his
house
on
Wednesday
among
grand
people
.
<EOS>
She
thinks
this
dress
will
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
,
"
said
Hans
.
<EOS>
Mirah
in
her
childlike
way
turned
toward
him
to
be
looked
at
;
and
he
,
going
to
a
little
further
distance
,
knelt
with
one
knee
on
a
hassock
to
survey
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
would
be
thought
a
very
good
stage
-
dress
for
me
,
"
she
said
,
pleadingly
,
"
in
a
part
where
I
was
to
come
on
as
a
poor
Jewess
and
sing
to
fashionable
Christians
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
effective
,
"
said
Hans
,
with
a
considering
air
;
"
it
would
stand
out
well
among
the
fashionable
_
chiffons
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
ought
not
to
claim
all
the
poverty
on
your
side
,
Mirah
,
"
said
Amy
.
<EOS>
"
There
are
plenty
of
poor
Christians
and
dreadfully
rich
Jews
and
fashionable
Jewesses
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
mean
any
harm
,
"
said
Mirah
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Only
I
have
been
used
to
thinking
about
my
dress
for
parts
in
plays
.
<EOS>
And
I
almost
always
had
a
part
with
a
plain
dress
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
makes
me
think
it
questionable
,
"
said
Hans
,
who
had
suddenly
become
as
fastidious
and
conventional
on
this
occasion
as
he
had
thought
Deronda
was
,
apropos
of
the
Berenice
-
pictures
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
looks
a
little
too
theatrical
.
<EOS>
We
must
not
make
you
a
_
rôle
_
of
the
poor
<EOS>
Jewess
 
or
of
being
a
Jewess
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hans
had
a
secret
desire
to
neutralize
the
Jewess
in
private
life
,
which
he
was
in
danger
of
not
keeping
secret
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
what
I
am
really
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
pretending
anything
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
be
anything
else
,
"
said
Mirah
.
<EOS>
"
I
always
feel
myself
a
Jewess
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
we
ca
n't
feel
that
about
you
,
"
said
Hans
,
with
a
devout
look
.
<EOS>
"
What
does
it
signify
whether
a
perfect
woman
is
a
Jewess
or
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
your
kind
way
of
praising
me
;
I
never
was
praised
so
before
,
"
said
Mirah
,
with
a
smile
,
which
was
rather
maddening
to
Hans
and
made
him
feel
still
more
of
a
cosmopolitan
.
  
<EOS>
"
People
do
n't
think
of
me
as
a
British
Christian
,
"
he
said
,
his
face
creasing
merrily
.
<EOS>
"
They
think
of
me
as
an
imperfectly
handsome
young
man
and
an
unpromising
painter
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
wandering
from
the
dress
,
"
said
Amy
.
<EOS>
"
If
that
will
not
do
,
how
are
we
to
get
another
before
Wednesday
?
<EOS>
and
to
-
morrow
Sunday
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
this
will
do
,
"
said
Mirah
,
entreatingly
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
all
real
,
you
know
,
"
here
she
looked
at
Hans
 
"
even
if
it
seemed
theatrical
.
<EOS>
Poor
Berenice
sitting
on
the
ruins
 
any
one
might
say
that
was
theatrical
,
but
I
know
that
this
is
just
what
she
would
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
scoundrel
,
"
said
Hans
,
overcome
by
this
misplaced
trust
.
<EOS>
"
That
is
my
invention
.
<EOS>
Nobody
knows
that
she
did
that
.
<EOS>
Shall
you
forgive
me
for
not
saying
so
before
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
"
said
Mirah
,
after
a
momentary
pause
of
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
You
knew
it
was
what
she
would
be
sure
to
do
 
a
Jewess
who
had
not
been
faithful
 
who
had
done
what
she
did
and
was
penitent
.
<EOS>
She
could
have
no
joy
but
to
afflict
herself
;
and
where
else
would
she
go
?
<EOS>
I
think
it
is
very
beautiful
that
you
should
enter
so
into
what
a
Jewess
would
feel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
Jewesses
of
that
time
sat
on
ruins
,
"
said
Hans
,
starting
up
with
a
sense
of
being
checkmated
.
<EOS>
"
That
makes
them
convenient
for
pictures
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
the
dress
 
the
dress
,
"
said
Amy
;
"
is
it
settled
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
is
it
not
?
"
said
Mirah
,
looking
doubtfully
at
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
who
in
her
turn
looked
up
at
her
son
,
and
said
,
"
What
do
you
think
,
Hans
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
That
dress
will
not
do
,
"
said
Hans
,
decisively
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
not
going
to
sit
on
ruins
.
<EOS>
You
must
jump
into
a
cab
with
her
,
little
mother
,
and
go
to
Regent
Street
.
<EOS>
It
's
plenty
of
time
to
get
anything
you
like
 
a
black
silk
dress
such
as
ladies
wear
.
<EOS>
She
must
not
be
taken
for
an
object
of
charity
.
<EOS>
She
has
talents
to
make
people
indebted
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
is
what
Mr.
Deronda
would
like
 
for
her
to
have
a
handsome
dress
,
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
deliberating
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
it
is
,
"
said
Hans
,
with
some
sharpness
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
take
my
word
for
what
a
gentleman
would
feel
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
do
what
Mr.
Deronda
would
like
me
to
do
,
"
said
Mirah
,
gravely
,
seeing
that
Mrs.
Meyrick
looked
toward
her
;
and
Hans
,
turning
on
his
heel
,
went
to
Kate
's
table
and
took
up
one
of
her
drawings
as
if
his
interest
needed
a
new
direction
.
  
<EOS>
"
Should
n't
you
like
to
make
a
study
of
Klesmer
's
head
,
Hans
?
"
said
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
have
often
seen
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Seen
him
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Hans
,
immediately
throwing
back
his
head
and
mane
,
seating
himself
at
the
piano
and
looking
round
him
as
if
he
were
surveying
an
amphitheatre
,
while
he
held
his
fingers
down
perpendicularly
toward
the
keys
.
<EOS>
But
then
in
another
instant
he
wheeled
round
on
the
stool
,
looked
at
Mirah
and
said
,
half
timidly
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
do
n't
like
this
mimicry
;
you
must
always
stop
my
nonsense
when
you
do
n't
like
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mirah
had
been
smiling
at
the
swiftly
-
made
image
,
and
she
smiled
still
,
but
with
a
touch
of
something
else
than
amusement
,
as
she
said
 
"
Thank
you
.
<EOS>
But
you
have
never
done
anything
I
did
not
like
.
<EOS>
I
hardly
think
he
could
,
belonging
to
you
,
"
she
added
,
looking
at
Mrs.
Meyrick
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
way
Hans
got
food
for
his
hope
.
<EOS>
How
could
the
rose
help
it
when
several
bees
in
succession
took
its
sweet
odor
as
a
sign
of
personal
attachment
?
      
<EOS>
"
Within
the
soul
a
faculty
abides
,
  
That
with
interpositions
,
which
would
hide
  
And
darken
,
so
can
deal
,
that
they
become
  
Contingencies
of
pomp

and
serve
to
exalt
  
Her

brightness

the
ample

behind
a

WORDSWORTH
:
_
Excursion
_
,
B.
IV
.
   
<EOS>
Deronda
came
out
of
the
narrow
house
at
Chelsea
in
a
frame
of
mind
that
made
him
long
for
some
good
bodily
exercise
to
carry
off
what
he
was
himself
inclined
to
call
the
fumes
of
his
temper
.
<EOS>
He
was
going
toward
the
city
,
and
the
sight
of
the
Chelsea
Stairs
with
the
waiting
boats
at
once
determined
him
to
avoid
the
irritating
inaction
of
being
driven
in
a
cab
,
by
calling
a
wherry
and
taking
an
oar
.
  
<EOS>
His
errand
was
to
go
to
Ram
's
book
-
shop
,
where
he
had
yesterday
arrived
too
late
for
Mordecai
's
midday
watch
,
and
had
been
told
that
he
invariably
came
there
again
between
five
and
six
.
<EOS>
Some
further
acquaintance
with
this
remarkable
inmate
of
the
Cohens
was
particularly
desired
by
Deronda
as
a
preliminary
to
redeeming
his
ring
:
he
wished
that
their
conversation
should
not
again
end
speedily
with
that
drop
of
Mordecai
's
interest
which
was
like
the
removal
of
a
drawbridge
,
and
threatened
to
shut
out
any
easy
communication
in
future
.
<EOS>
As
he
got
warmed
with
the
use
of
the
oar
,
fixing
his
mind
on
the
errand
before
him
and
the
ends
he
wanted
to
achieve
on
Mirah
's
account
,
he
experienced
,
as
was
wo
nt
with
him
,
a
quick
change
of
mental
light
,
shifting
his
point
of
view
to
that
of
the
person
whom
he
had
been
thinking
of
hitherto
chiefly
as
serviceable
to
his
own
purposes
,
and
was
inclined
to
taunt
himself
with
being
not
much
better
than
an
enlisting
sergeant
,
who
never
troubles
himself
with
the
drama
that
brings
him
the
needful
recruits
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
if
I
got
from
this
man
the
information
I
am
most
anxious
about
,
"
thought
Deronda
,
"
I
should
be
contented
enough
if
he
felt
no
disposition
to
tell
me
more
of
himself
,
or
why
he
seemed
to
have
some
expectation
from
me
which
was
disappointed
.
<EOS>
The
sort
of
curiosity
he
stirs
would
die
out
;
and
yet
it
might
be
that
he
had
neared
and
parted
as
one
can
imagine
two
ships
doing
,
each
freighted
with
an
exile
who
would
have
recognized
the
other
if
the
two
could
have
looked
out
face
to
face
.
<EOS>
Not
that
there
is
any
likelihood
of
a
peculiar
tie
between
me
and
this
poor
fellow
,
whose
voyage
,
I
fancy
,
must
soon
be
over
.
<EOS>
But
I
wonder
whether
there
is
much
of
that
momentous
mutual
missing
between
people
who
interchange
blank
looks
,
or
even
long
for
one
another
's
absence
in
a
crowded
place
.
<EOS>
However
,
one
makes
one
's
self
chances
of
missing
by
going
on
the
recruiting
sergeant
's
plan
.
<EOS>
"
  
When
the
wherry
was
approaching
Blackfriars
Bridge
,
where
Deronda
meant
to
land
,
it
was
half
-
past
four
,
and
the
gray
day
was
dying
gloriously
,
its
western
clouds
all
broken
into
narrowing
purple
strata
before
a
wide
-
spreading
saffron
clearness
,
which
in
the
sky
had
a
monumental
calm
,
but
on
the
river
,
with
its
changing
objects
,
was
reflected
as
a
luminous
movement
,
the
alternate
flash
of
ripples
or
currents
,
the
sudden
glow
of
the
brown
sail
,
the
passage
of
laden
barges
from
blackness
into
color
,
making
an
active
response
to
that
brooding
glory
.
  
<EOS>
Feeling
well
heated
by
this
time
,
Deronda
gave
up
the
oar
and
drew
over
him
again
his
Inverness
cape
.
<EOS>
As
he
lifted
up
his
head
while
fastening
the
topmost
button
his
eyes
caught
a
well
-
remembered
face
looking
toward
him
over
the
parapet
of
the
bridge
 
brought
out
by
the
western
light
into
startling
distinctness
and
brilliancy
 
an
illuminated
type
of
bodily
emaciation
and
spiritual
eagerness
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
face
of
Mordecai
,
who
also
,
in
his
watch
toward
the
west
,
had
caught
sight
of
the
advancing
boat
,
and
had
kept
it
fast
within
his
gaze
,
at
first
simply
because
it
was
advancing
,
then
with
a
recovery
of
impressions
that
made
him
quiver
as
with
a
presentiment
,
till
at
last
the
nearing
figure
lifted
up
its
face
toward
him
 
the
face
of
his
visions
 
and
then
immediately
,
with
white
uplifted
hand
,
beckoned
again
and
again
.
  
<EOS>
For
Deronda
,
anxious
that
Mordecai
should
recognize
and
await
him
,
had
lost
no
time
before
signaling
,
and
the
answer
came
straightway
.
<EOS>
Mordecai
lifted
his
cap
and
waved
it
 
feeling
in
that
moment
that
his
inward
prophecy
was
fulfilled
.
<EOS>
Obstacles
,
incongruities
,
all
melted
into
the
sense
of
completion
with
which
his
soul
was
flooded
by
this
outward
satisfaction
of
his
longing
.
<EOS>
His
exultation
was
not
widely
different
from
that
of
the
experimenter
,
bending
over
the
first
stirrings
of
change
that
correspond
to
what
in
the
fervor
of
concentrated
prevision
his
thought
has
foreshadowed
.
<EOS>
The
prefigured
friend
had
come
from
the
golden
background
,
and
had
signaled
to
him
:
<EOS>
this
actually
was
:
the
rest
was
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
In
three
minutes
Deronda
had
landed
,
had
paid
his
boatman
,
and
was
joining
Mordecai
,
whose
instinct
it
was
to
stand
perfectly
still
and
wait
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
very
glad
to
see
you
standing
here
,
"
said
Deronda
,
"
for
I
was
intending
to
go
on
to
the
book
-
shop
and
look
for
you
again
.
<EOS>
I
was
there
yesterday
 
<EOS>
perhaps
they
mentioned
it
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Mordecai
;
"
that
was
the
reason
I
came
to
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
answer
,
made
with
simple
gravity
,
was
startlingly
mysterious
to
Deronda
.
<EOS>
Were
the
peculiarities
of
this
man
really
associated
with
any
sort
of
mental
alienation
,
according
to
Cohen
's
hint
?
  
<EOS>
"
You
knew
nothing
of
my
being
at
Chelsea
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
after
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
<EOS>
but
I
expected
you
to
come
down
the
river
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
waiting
for
you
these
five
years
.
<EOS>
"
Mordecai
's
deep
-
sunk
eyes
were
fixed
on
those
of
the
friend
who
had
at
last
arrived
with
a
look
of
affectionate
dependence
,
at
once
pathetic
and
solemn
.
<EOS>
Deronda
's
sensitiveness
was
not
the
less
responsive
because
he
could
not
but
believe
that
this
strangely
-
disclosed
relation
was
founded
on
an
illusion
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
a
satisfaction
to
me
if
I
can
be
of
any
real
use
to
you
,
"
he
answered
,
very
earnestly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
we
get
into
a
cab
and
drive
to
 
wherever
you
wish
to
go
?
<EOS>
You
have
probably
had
walking
enough
with
your
short
breath
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
go
to
the
book
-
shop
.
<EOS>
It
will
soon
be
time
for
me
to
be
there
.
<EOS>
But
now
look
up
the
river
,
"
said
Mordecai
,
turning
again
toward
it
and
speaking
in
undertones
of
what
may
be
called
an
excited
calm
 
so
absorbed
by
a
sense
of
fulfillment
that
he
was
conscious
of
no
barrier
to
a
complete
understanding
between
him
and
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
See
the
sky
,
how
it
is
slowly
fading
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
loved
this
bridge
:
I
stood
on
it
when
I
was
a
little
boy
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
meeting
-
place
for
the
spiritual
messengers
.
<EOS>
It
is
true
 
what
the
Masters
said
 
that
each
order
of
things
has
its
angel
:
that
means
the
full
message
of
each
from
what
is
afar
.
<EOS>
Here
I
have
listened
to
the
messages
of
earth
and
sky
;
when
I
was
stronger
I
used
to
stay
and
watch
for
the
stars
in
the
deep
heavens
.
<EOS>
But
this
time
just
about
sunset
was
always
what
I
loved
best
.
<EOS>
It
has
sunk
into
me
and
dwelt
with
me
 
<EOS>
fading
,
slowly
fading
:
it
was
my
own
decline
:
it
paused
 
<EOS>
it
waited
,
till
at
last
it
brought
me
my
new
life
 
<EOS>
my
new
self
 
who
will
live
when
this
breath
is
all
breathed
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
did
not
speak
.
<EOS>
He
felt
himself
strangely
wrought
upon
.
<EOS>
The
first
-
prompted
suspicion
that
Mordecai
might
be
liable
to
hallucinations
of
thought
 
might
have
become
a
monomaniac
on
some
subject
which
had
given
too
severe
a
strain
to
his
diseased
organism
 
gave
way
to
a
more
submissive
expectancy
.
<EOS>
His
nature
was
too
large
,
too
ready
to
conceive
regions
beyond
his
own
experience
,
to
rest
at
once
in
the
easy
explanation
,
"
madness
,
"
whenever
a
consciousness
showed
some
fullness
and
conviction
where
his
own
was
blank
.
<EOS>
It
accorded
with
his
habitual
disposition
that
he
should
meet
rather
than
resist
any
claim
on
him
in
the
shape
of
another
's
need
;
and
this
claim
brought
with
it
a
sense
of
solemnity
which
seemed
a
radiation
from
Mordecai
,
as
utterly
nullifying
his
outward
poverty
and
lifting
him
into
authority
as
if
he
had
been
that
preternatural
guide
seen
in
the
universal
legend
,
who
suddenly
drops
his
mean
disguise
and
stands
a
manifest
Power
.
<EOS>
That
impression
was
the
more
sanctioned
by
a
sort
of
resolved
quietude
which
the
persuasion
of
fulfillment
had
produced
in
Mordecai
's
manner
.
<EOS>
After
they
had
stood
a
moment
in
silence
he
said
,
"
Let
us
go
now
,
"
and
when
they
were
riding
he
added
,
"
We
will
get
down
at
the
end
of
the
street
and
walk
to
the
shop
.
<EOS>
You
can
look
at
the
books
,
and
Mr.
Ram
will
be
going
away
directly
and
leave
us
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
seemed
that
this
enthusiast
was
just
as
cautious
,
just
as
much
alive
to
judgments
in
other
minds
as
if
he
had
been
that
antipode
of
all
enthusiasm
called
"
a
man
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
While
they
were
rattling
along
in
the
cab
,
Mirah
was
still
present
with
Deronda
in
the
midst
of
this
strange
experience
,
but
he
foresaw
that
the
course
of
conversation
would
be
determined
by
Mordecai
,
not
by
himself
:
<EOS>
he
was
no
longer
confident
what
questions
he
should
be
able
to
ask
;
and
with
a
reaction
on
his
own
mood
,
he
inwardly
said
,
"
I
suppose
I
am
in
a
state
of
complete
superstition
,
just
as
if
I
were
awaiting
the
destiny
that
could
interpret
the
oracle
.
<EOS>
But
some
strong
relation
there
must
be
between
me
and
this
man
,
since
he
feels
it
strongly
.
<EOS>
Great
heaven
!
<EOS>
what
relation
has
proved
itself
more
potent
in
the
world
than
faith
even
when
mistaken
 
than
expectation
even
when
perpetually
disappointed
?
<EOS>
Is
my
side
of
the
relation
to
be
disappointing
or
fulfilling
?
 
<EOS>
well
,
if
it
is
ever
possible
for
me
to
fulfill
I
will
not
disappoint
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
ten
minutes
the
two
men
,
with
as
intense
a
consciousness
as
if
they
had
been
two
undeclared
lovers
,
felt
themselves
alone
in
the
small
gas
-
lit
book
-
shop
and
turned
face
to
face
,
each
baring
his
head
from
an
instinctive
feeling
that
they
wished
to
see
each
other
fully
.
<EOS>
Mordecai
came
forward
to
lean
his
back
against
the
little
counter
,
while
Deronda
stood
against
the
opposite
wall
hardly
more
than
four
feet
off
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
perpetuate
those
two
faces
,
as
Titian
's
"
Tribute
Money
"
has
perpetuated
two
types
presenting
another
sort
of
contrast
.
<EOS>
Imagine
 
we
all
of
us
<EOS>
can
 
the
pathetic
stamp
of
consumption
with
its
brilliancy
of
glance
to
which
the
sharply
-
defined
structure
of
features
reminding
one
of
a
forsaken
temple
,
give
already
a
far
-
off
look
as
of
one
getting
unwillingly
out
of
reach
;
and
imagine
it
on
a
Jewish
face
naturally
accentuated
for
the
expression
of
an
eager
mind
 
the
face
of
a
man
little
above
thirty
,
but
with
that
age
upon
it
which
belongs
to
time
lengthened
by
suffering
,
the
hair
and
beard
,
still
black
,
throwing
out
the
yellow
pallor
of
the
skin
,
the
difficult
breathing
giving
more
decided
marking
to
the
mobile
nostril
,
the
wasted
yellow
hands
conspicuous
on
the
folded
arms
:
then
give
to
the
yearning
consumptive
glance
something
of
the
slowly
dying
mother
's
look
,
when
her
one
loved
son
visits
her
bedside
,
and
the
flickering
power
of
gladness
leaps
out
as
she
says
,
"
My
boy
!
"
 
<EOS>
for
the
sense
of
spiritual
perpetuation
in
another
resembles
that
maternal
transference
of
self
.
  
<EOS>
Seeing
such
a
portrait
you
would
see
Mordecai
.
<EOS>
And
opposite
to
him
was
a
face
not
more
distinctively
oriental
than
many
a
type
seen
among
what
we
call
the
Latin
races
;
rich
in
youthful
health
,
and
with
a
forcible
masculine
gravity
in
its
repose
,
that
gave
the
value
of
judgment
to
the
reverence
with
which
he
met
the
gaze
of
this
mysterious
son
of
poverty
who
claimed
him
as
a
long
-
expected
friend
.
<EOS>
The
more
exquisite
quality
of
Deronda
's
nature
 
that
keenly
perceptive
sympathetic
emotiveness
which
ran
along
with
his
speculative
tendency
 
was
never
more
thoroughly
tested
.
<EOS>
He
felt
nothing
that
could
be
called
belief
in
the
validity
of
Mordecai
's
impressions
concerning
him
or
in
the
probability
of
any
greatly
effective
issue
:
what
he
felt
was
a
profound
sensibility
to
a
cry
from
the
depths
of
another
and
accompanying
that
,
the
summons
to
be
receptive
instead
of
superciliously
prejudging
.
<EOS>
Receptiveness
is
a
rare
and
massive
power
,
like
fortitude
;
and
this
state
of
mind
now
gave
Deronda
's
face
its
utmost
expression
of
calm
benignant
force
 
an
expression
which
nourished
Mordecai
's
confidence
and
made
an
open
way
before
him
.
<EOS>
He
began
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
know
what
has
guided
me
to
you
and
brought
us
together
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
You
are
wondering
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
impatient
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
ready
to
listen
to
whatever
you
may
wish
to
disclose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
some
of
the
reasons
why
I
needed
you
,
"
said
Mordecai
,
speaking
quietly
,
as
if
he
wished
to
reserve
his
strength
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
that
I
am
dying
.
<EOS>
You
see
that
I
am
as
one
shut
up
behind
bars
by
the
wayside
,
who
if
he
spoke
to
any
would
be
met
only
by
head
-
shaking
and
pity
.
<EOS>
The
day
is
closing
 
the
light
is
fading
 
<EOS>
soon
we
should
not
have
been
able
to
discern
each
other
.
<EOS>
But
you
have
come
in
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
rejoice
that
I
am
come
in
time
,
"
said
Deronda
,
feelingly
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
say
,
"
I
hope
you
are
not
mistaken
in
me
,
"
 
the
very
word
"
mistaken
,
"
he
thought
,
would
be
a
cruelty
at
that
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
the
hidden
reasons
why
I
need
you
began
afar
off
,
"
said
Mordecai
;
"
began
in
my
early
years
when
I
was
studying
in
another
land
.
<EOS>
Then
ideas
,
beloved
ideas
,
came
to
me
,
because
I
was
a
Jew
.
<EOS>
They
were
a
trust
to
fulfill
,
because
I
was
a
Jew
.
<EOS>
They
were
an
inspiration
,
because
I
was
a
Jew
,
and
felt
the
heart
of
my
race
beating
within
me
.
<EOS>
They
were
my
life
;
I
was
not
fully
born
till
then
.
<EOS>
I
counted
this
heart
,
and
this
breath
,
and
this
right
hand
"
 
<EOS>
Mordecai
had
pathetically
pressed
his
hand
upon
his
breast
,
and
then
stretched
its
wasted
fingers
out
before
him
 
<EOS>
"
I
counted
my
sleep
and
my
waking
,
and
the
work
I
fed
my
body
with
,
and
the
sights
that
fed
my
eyes
 
I
counted
them
<EOS>
but
as
fuel
to
the
divine
flame
.
<EOS>
But
I
had
done
as
one
who
wanders
and
engraves
his
thought
in
rocky
solitudes
,
and
before
I
could
change
my
course
came
care
and
labor
and
disease
,
and
blocked
the
way
before
me
,
and
bound
me
with
the
iron
that
eats
itself
into
the
soul
.
<EOS>
Then
I
said
,
"
How
shall
I
save
the
life
within
me
from
being
stifled
with
this
stifled
breath
?
"
<EOS>
"
  
Mordecai
paused
to
rest
that
poor
breath
which
had
been
taxed
by
the
rising
excitement
of
his
speech
.
<EOS>
And
also
he
wished
to
check
that
excitement
.
<EOS>
Deronda
dared
not
speak
the
very
silence
in
the
narrow
space
seemed
alive
with
mingled
awe
and
compassion
before
this
struggling
fervor
.
<EOS>
And
presently
Mordecai
went
on
    
"
<EOS>
But
you
may
misunderstand
me
.
<EOS>
I
speak
not
as
an
ignorant
dreamer
 
as
one
bred
up
in
the
inland
valleys
,
thinking
ancient
thoughts
anew
,
and
not
knowing
them
ancient
,
never
having
stood
by
the
great
waters
where
the
world
's
knowledge
passes
to
and
fro
.
<EOS>
English
is
my
mother
-
tongue
,
England
is
the
native
land
of
this
body
,
which
is
<EOS>
but
as
a
breaking
pot
of
earth
around
the
fruit
-
bearing
tree
,
whose
seed
might
make
the
desert
rejoice
.
<EOS>
But
my
true
life
was
nourished
in
Holland
at
the
feet
of
my
mother
's
brother
,
a
Rabbi
skilled
in
special
learning
:
and
when
he
died
I
went
to
Hamburg
to
study
,
and
afterwards
to
Göttingen
,
that
I
might
take
a
larger
outlook
on
my
people
,
and
on
the
Gentile
world
,
and
drank
knowledge
at
all
sources
.
<EOS>
I
was
a
youth
;
I
felt
free
;
I
saw
our
chief
seats
in
Germany
;
I
was
not
then
in
utter
poverty
.
<EOS>
And
I
had
possessed
myself
of
a
handicraft
.
<EOS>
For
I
said
,
I
care
not
if
my
lot
be
as
that
of
Joshua
ben
Chananja
:
after
the
last
destruction
he
earned
his
bread
by
making
needles
,
but
in
his
youth
he
had
been
a
singer
on
the
steps
of
the
Temple
,
and
had
a
memory
of
what
was
before
the
glory
departed
.
<EOS>
I
said
,
let
my
body
dwell
in
poverty
,
and
my
hands
be
as
the
hands
of
the
toiler
:
but
let
my
soul
be
as
a
temple
of
remembrance
where
the
treasures
of
knowledge
enter
and
the
inner
sanctuary
is
hope
.
<EOS>
I
knew
what
I
chose
.
<EOS>
They
said
,
"
He
feeds
himself
on
visions
,
"
and
I
denied
not
;
for
visions
are
the
creators
and
feeders
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
I
see
,
I
measure
the
world
as
it
is
,
which
the
vision
will
create
anew
.
<EOS>
You
are
not
listening
to
one
who
raves
aloof
from
the
lives
of
his
fellows
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mordecai
paused
,
and
Deronda
,
feeling
that
the
pause
was
expectant
,
said
,
"
Do
me
the
justice
to
believe
that
I
was
not
inclined
to
call
your
words
raving
.
<EOS>
I
listen
that
I
may
know
,
without
prejudgment
.
<EOS>
I
have
had
experience
which
gives
me
a
keen
interest
in
the
story
of
a
spiritual
destiny
embraced
willingly
,
and
embraced
in
youth
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
A
spiritual
destiny
embraced
willingly
 
in
youth
?
"
Mordecai
repeated
in
a
corrective
tone
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
the
soul
fully
born
within
me
,
and
it
came
in
my
boyhood
.
<EOS>
It
brought
its
own
world
 
a
mediaeval
world
,
where
there
are
men
who
made
the
ancient
language
live
again
in
new
psalms
of
exile
.
<EOS>
They
had
absorbed
the
philosophy
of
the
Gentile
into
the
faith
of
the
Jew
,
and
they
still
yearned
toward
a
center
for
our
race
.
<EOS>
One
of
their
souls
was
born
again
within
me
,
and
awakened
amid
the
memories
of
their
world
.
<EOS>
It
traveled
into
Spain
and
Provence
;
it
debated
with
Aben
-
Ezra
;
it
took
ship
with
Jehuda
ha
-
Levi
;
it
heard
the
roar
of
the
Crusaders
and
the
shrieks
of
tortured
Israel
.
<EOS>
And
when
its
dumb
tongue
was
loosed
,
it
spoke
the
speech
they
had
made
alive
with
the
new
blood
of
their
ardor
,
their
sorrow
,
and
their
martyred
trust
<EOS>
:
it
sang
with
the
cadence
of
their
strain
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mordecai
paused
again
,
and
then
said
in
a
loud
,
hoarse
whisper
    
"
While
it
is
imprisoned
in
me
,
it
will
never
learn
another
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Have
you
written
entirely
in
Hebrew
,
then
?
"
said
Deronda
,
remembering
with
some
anxiety
the
former
question
as
to
his
own
knowledge
of
that
tongue
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
 
yes
,
"
said
Mordecai
,
in
a
tone
of
deep
sadness
:
"
in
my
youth
I
wandered
toward
that
solitude
,
not
feeling
that
it
was
a
solitude
.
<EOS>
I
had
the
ranks
of
the
great
dead
around
me
;
the
martyrs
gathered
and
listened
.
<EOS>
But
soon
I
found
that
the
living
were
deaf
to
me
.
<EOS>
At
first
I
saw
my
life
spread
as
a
long
future
:
I
said
part
of
my
Jewish
heritage
is
an
unbreaking
patience
;
part
is
skill
to
seek
divers
methods
and
find
a
rooting
-
place
where
the
planters
despair
.
<EOS>
But
there
came
new
messengers
from
the
Eternal
.
<EOS>
I
had
to
bow
under
the
yoke
that
presses
on
the
great
multitude
born
of
woman
:
<EOS>
family
troubles
called
me
 
I
had
to
work
,
to
care
,
not
for
myself
alone
.
<EOS>
I
was
left
solitary
again
;
but
already
the
angel
of
death
had
turned
to
me
and
beckoned
,
and
I
felt
his
skirts
continually
on
my
path
.
<EOS>
I
loosed
not
my
effort
.
<EOS>
I
besought
hearing
and
help
.
<EOS>
I
spoke
;
I
went
to
men
of
our
people
 
to
the
rich
in
influence
or
knowledge
,
to
the
rich
in
other
wealth
.
<EOS>
But
I
found
none
to
listen
with
understanding
.
<EOS>
I
was
rebuked
for
error
;
I
was
offered
a
small
sum
in
charity
.
<EOS>
No
wonder
.
<EOS>
I
looked
poor
;
I
carried
a
bundle
of
Hebrew
manuscript
with
me
;
I
said
,
our
chief
teachers
are
misleading
the
hope
of
our
race
.
<EOS>
Scholar
and
merchant
were
both
too
busy
to
listen
.
<EOS>
Scorn
stood
as
interpreter
between
me
and
them
.
<EOS>
One
said
,
"
The
book
of
Mormon
would
never
have
answered
in
Hebrew
;
and
if
you
mean
to
address
our
learned
men
,
it
is
not
likely
you
can
teach
them
anything
.
"
<EOS>
He
touched
a
truth
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
last
words
had
a
perceptible
irony
in
their
hoarsened
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
though
you
had
accustomed
yourself
to
write
in
Hebrew
,
few
,
surely
,
can
use
English
better
,
"
said
Deronda
,
wanting
to
hint
consolation
in
a
new
effort
for
which
he
could
smooth
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
Mordecai
shook
his
head
slowly
,
and
answered
    
"
Too
late
 
too
late
.
<EOS>
I
can
write
no
more
.
<EOS>
My
writing
would
be
like
this
gasping
breath
.
<EOS>
But
the
breath
may
wake
the
fount
of
pity
 
<EOS>
the
writing
not
.
<EOS>
If
I
could
write
now
and
used
English
,
I
should
be
as
one
who
beats
a
board
to
summon
those
who
have
been
used
to
no
signal
but
a
bell
.
<EOS>
My
soul
has
an
ear
to
hear
the
faults
of
its
own
speech
.
<EOS>
New
writing
of
mine
would
be
like
this
body
"
 
<EOS>
Mordecai
spread
his
arms
 
"
within
it
there
might
be
the
Ruach
-
ha
-
kodesh
 
<EOS>
the
breath
of
divine
thought
 
<EOS>
but
,
men
would
smile
at
it
and
say
,
"
A
poor
Jew
!
"
and
the
chief
smilers
would
be
of
my
own
people
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mordecai
let
his
hands
fall
,
and
his
head
sink
in
melancholy
:
for
the
moment
he
had
lost
hold
of
his
hope
.
<EOS>
Despondency
,
conjured
up
by
his
own
words
,
had
floated
in
and
hovered
above
him
with
eclipsing
wings
.
<EOS>
He
had
sunk
into
momentary
darkness
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
with
you
 
<EOS>
I
feel
strongly
with
you
,
"
said
Deronda
,
in
a
clear
deep
voice
which
was
itself
a
cordial
,
apart
from
the
words
of
sympathy
.
"
<EOS>
But
forgive
me
if
I
speak
hastily
 
for
what
you
have
actually
written
there
<EOS>
need
be
no
utter
burial
.
<EOS>
The
means
of
publication
are
within
reach
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
rely
on
me
,
I
can
assure
you
of
all
that
is
necessary
to
that
end
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
not
enough
,
"
said
Mordecai
,
quickly
,
looking
up
again
with
the
flash
of
recovered
memory
and
confidence
.
<EOS>
"
That
is
not
all
my
trust
in
you
.
<EOS>
You
must
be
not
only
a
hand
to
me
,
but
a
soul
 
believing
my
belief
 
being
moved
by
my
reasons
 
hoping
my
hope
-
seeing
the
vision
I
point
to
 
beholding
a
glory
where
I
behold
it
!
"
 
<EOS>
Mordecai
had
taken
a
step
nearer
as
he
spoke
,
and
now
laid
his
hand
on
Deronda
's
arm
with
a
tight
grasp
;
his
face
little
more
than
a
foot
off
had
something
like
a
pale
flame
in
it
 
an
intensity
of
reliance
that
acted
as
a
peremptory
claim
,
while
he
went
on
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
my
life
:
it
will
be
planted
afresh
;
it
will
grow
.
<EOS>
You
shall
take
the
inheritance
;
it
has
been
gathering
for
ages
.
<EOS>
The
generations
are
crowding
on
my
narrow
life
as
a
bridge
:
what
has
been
and
what
is
to
be
are
meeting
there
;
and
the
bridge
is
breaking
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
found
you
.
<EOS>
You
have
come
in
time
,
You
will
take
the
inheritance
which
the
base
son
refuses
because
of
the
tombs
which
the
plow
and
harrow
may
not
pass
over
or
the
gold
-
seeker
disturb
:
you
will
take
the
sacred
inheritance
of
the
Jew
.
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
had
become
as
pallid
as
Mordecai
.
<EOS>
Quick
as
an
alarm
of
flood
or
fire
,
there
spread
within
him
not
only
a
compassionate
dread
of
discouraging
this
fellowman
who
urged
a
prayer
as
one
in
the
last
agony
,
but
also
the
opposing
dread
of
fatally
feeding
an
illusion
,
and
being
hurried
on
to
a
self
-
committal
which
might
turn
into
a
falsity
.
<EOS>
The
peculiar
appeal
to
his
tenderness
overcame
the
repulsion
that
most
of
us
experience
under
a
grasp
and
speech
which
assumed
to
dominate
.
<EOS>
The
difficulty
to
him
was
to
inflict
the
accents
of
hesitation
and
doubt
on
this
ardent
suffering
creature
,
who
was
crowding
too
much
of
his
brief
being
into
a
moment
of
perhaps
extravagant
trust
.
<EOS>
With
exquisite
instinct
,
Deronda
,
before
he
opened
his
lips
,
placed
his
palm
gently
on
Mordecai
's
straining
hand
 
<EOS>
an
act
just
then
equal
to
many
speeches
.
<EOS>
And
after
that
he
said
,
without
haste
,
as
if
conscious
that
he
might
be
wrong
    
<EOS>
"
Do
you
forget
what
I
told
you
when
we
first
saw
each
other
?
<EOS>
Do
you
remember
that
I
said
I
was
not
of
your
race
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
ca
n't
be
true
,
"
Mordecai
whispered
immediately
,
with
no
sign
of
shock
.
<EOS>
The
sympathetic
hand
still
upon
him
had
fortified
the
feeling
which
was
stronger
than
those
words
of
denial
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
perceptible
pause
,
Deronda
feeling
it
impossible
to
answer
,
conscious
indeed
that
the
assertion
"
It
ca
n't
be
true
"
 
<EOS>
had
the
pressure
of
argument
for
him
.
<EOS>
Mordecai
,
too
entirely
possessed
by
the
supreme
importance
of
the
relation
between
himself
and
Deronda
to
have
any
other
care
in
his
speech
,
followed
up
that
assertion
by
a
second
,
which
came
to
his
lips
as
a
mere
sequence
of
his
long
-
cherished
conviction
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
sure
of
your
own
origin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
know
that
?
"
said
Daniel
,
with
an
habitual
shrinking
which
made
him
remove
his
hands
from
Mordecai
's
,
who
also
relaxed
his
hold
,
and
fell
back
into
his
former
leaning
position
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
;
what
is
my
life
else
?
"
said
Mordecai
,
with
a
low
cry
of
impatience
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Tell
me
everything
:
tell
me
why
you
deny
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
could
have
no
conception
what
that
demand
was
to
the
hearer
 
<EOS>
how
probingly
it
touched
the
hidden
sensibility
,
the
vividly
conscious
reticence
of
years
;
how
the
uncertainty
he
was
insisting
on
as
part
of
his
own
hope
had
always
for
Daniel
been
a
threatening
possibility
of
painful
revelation
about
his
mother
.
<EOS>
But
the
moment
had
influences
which
were
not
only
new
but
solemn
to
Deronda
;
any
evasion
here
might
turn
out
to
be
a
hateful
refusal
of
some
task
that
belonged
to
him
,
some
act
of
due
fellowship
;
in
any
case
it
would
be
a
cruel
rebuff
to
a
being
who
was
appealing
to
him
as
a
forlorn
hope
under
the
shadow
of
a
coming
doom
.
<EOS>
After
a
few
moments
,
he
said
,
with
a
great
effort
over
himself
 
determined
to
tell
all
the
truth
briefly
    
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
known
my
mother
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
knowledge
about
her
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
called
any
man
father
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
convinced
that
my
father
is
an
Englishman
.
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
's
deep
tones
had
a
tremor
in
them
as
he
uttered
this
confession
;
and
all
the
while
there
was
an
undercurrent
of
amazement
in
him
at
the
strange
circumstances
under
which
he
uttered
it
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
if
Mordecai
were
hardly
overrating
his
own
power
to
determine
the
action
of
the
friend
whom
he
had
mysteriously
chosen
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
seen
 
it
will
be
declared
,
"
said
Mordecai
,
triumphantly
.
<EOS>
"
The
world
grows
,
and
its
frame
is
knit
together
by
the
growing
soul
;
dim
,
dim
at
first
,
then
clearer
and
more
clear
,
the
consciousness
discerns
remote
stirrings
.
<EOS>
As
thoughts
move
within
us
darkly
,
and
shake
us
before
they
are
fully
discerned
 
<EOS>
so
events
 
<EOS>
so
beings
<EOS>
:
they
are
knit
with
us
in
the
growth
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
You
have
risen
within
me
like
a
thought
not
fully
spelled
;
my
soul
is
shaken
before
the
words
are
all
there
.
<EOS>
The
rest
will
come
 
it
will
come
.
"
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
not
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
the
outward
event
has
not
always
been
a
fulfillment
of
the
firmest
faith
,
"
said
Deronda
,
in
a
tone
that
was
made
hesitating
by
the
painfully
conflicting
desires
,
not
to
give
any
severe
blow
to
Mordecai
,
and
not
to
give
his
confidence
a
sanction
which
might
have
the
severest
of
blows
in
reserve
.
  
<EOS>
Mordecai
's
face
,
which
had
been
illuminated
to
the
utmost
in
that
last
declaration
of
his
confidence
,
changed
under
Deronda
's
words
,
not
only
into
any
show
of
collapsed
trust
:
the
force
did
not
disappear
from
the
expression
,
but
passed
from
the
triumphant
into
the
firmly
resistant
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
remind
me
that
I
may
be
under
an
illusion
 
that
the
history
of
our
people
's
trust
has
been
full
of
illusion
.
<EOS>
I
face
it
all
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
Mordecai
paused
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Then
bending
his
head
a
little
forward
,
he
said
,
in
his
hoarse
whisper
,
"
_
<EOS>
So
it
might
be
with
my
trust
,
if
you
would
make
it
an
illusion
.
<EOS>
But
you
will
not
.
<EOS>
_
"
  
The
very
sharpness
with
which
these
words
penetrated
Deronda
made
him
feel
the
more
that
here
was
a
crisis
in
which
he
must
be
firm
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
my
birth
was
does
not
lie
in
my
will
,
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
My
sense
of
claims
on
me
can
not
be
independent
of
my
knowledge
there
.
<EOS>
And
I
can
not
promise
you
that
I
will
try
to
hasten
a
disclosure
.
<EOS>
Feelings
which
have
struck
root
through
half
my
life
may
still
hinder
me
from
doing
what
I
have
never
been
able
to
do
.
<EOS>
Everything
must
be
waited
for
.
<EOS>
I
must
know
more
of
the
truth
about
my
own
life
,
and
I
must
know
more
of
what
it
would
become
if
it
were
made
a
part
of
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
Mordecai
had
folded
his
arms
again
while
Deronda
was
speaking
,
and
now
answered
with
equal
firmness
,
though
with
difficult
breathing
    
<EOS>
"
You
_
shall
_
know
.
<EOS>
What
are
we
met
for
,
but
that
you
should
know
.
<EOS>
Your
doubts
lie
as
light
as
dust
on
my
belief
.
<EOS>
I
know
the
philosophies
of
this
time
and
of
other
times
;
if
I
chose
I
could
answer
a
summons
before
their
tribunals
.
<EOS>
I
could
silence
the
beliefs
which
are
the
mother
-
tongue
of
my
soul
and
speak
with
the
rote
-
learned
language
of
a
system
,
that
gives
you
the
spelling
of
all
things
,
sure
of
its
alphabet
covering
them
all
.
<EOS>
I
could
silence
them
:
may
not
a
man
silence
his
awe
or
his
love
,
and
take
to
finding
reasons
,
which
others
demand
?
<EOS>
But
if
his
love
lies
deeper
than
any
reasons
to
be
found
?
<EOS>
Man
finds
his
pathways
:
at
first
they
were
foot
tracks
,
as
those
of
the
beast
in
the
wilderness
:
now
they
are
swift
and
invisible
:
<EOS>
his
thought
dives
through
the
ocean
,
and
his
wishes
thread
the
air
<EOS>
:
has
he
found
all
the
pathways
yet
?
<EOS>
What
reaches
him
,
stays
with
him
,
rules
him
:
he
must
accept
it
,
not
knowing
its
pathway
.
<EOS>
Say
,
my
expectation
of
you
has
grown
but
as
false
hopes
grow
.
<EOS>
That
doubt
is
in
your
mind
?
<EOS>
Well
,
my
expectation
was
there
,
and
you
are
come
.
<EOS>
Men
have
died
of
thirst
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
thirsty
,
and
the
water
is
on
my
lips
!
<EOS>
What
are
doubts
to
me
?
<EOS>
In
the
hour
when
you
come
to
me
and
say
,
'
I
reject
your
soul
<EOS>
:
I
know
that
I
am
not
a
Jew
:
we
have
no
lot
in
common
'
 
<EOS>
I
shall
not
doubt
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
certain
 
certain
that
I
have
been
deluded
.
<EOS>
That
hour
will
never
come
!
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
felt
a
new
chord
sounding
in
his
speech
:
it
was
rather
imperious
than
appealing
 
<EOS>
had
more
of
conscious
power
than
of
the
yearning
need
which
had
acted
as
a
beseeching
grasp
on
him
before
.
<EOS>
And
usually
,
though
he
was
the
reverse
of
pugnacious
,
such
a
change
of
attitude
toward
him
would
have
weakened
his
inclination
to
admit
a
claim
.
<EOS>
But
here
there
was
something
that
balanced
his
resistance
and
kept
it
aloof
.
<EOS>
This
strong
man
whose
gaze
was
sustainedly
calm
and
his
finger
-
nails
pink
with
health
,
who
was
exercised
in
all
questioning
,
and
accused
of
excessive
mental
independence
,
still
felt
a
subduing
influence
over
him
in
the
tenacious
certitude
of
the
fragile
creature
before
him
,
whose
pallid
yellow
nostril
was
tense
with
effort
as
his
breath
labored
under
the
burthen
of
eager
speech
.
<EOS>
The
influence
seemed
to
strengthen
the
bond
of
sympathetic
obligation
.
<EOS>
In
Deronda
at
this
moment
the
desire
to
escape
what
might
turn
into
a
trying
embarrassment
was
no
more
likely
to
determine
action
than
the
solicitations
of
indolence
are
likely
to
determine
it
in
one
with
whom
industry
is
a
daily
law
.
<EOS>
He
answered
simply
    
"
It
is
my
wish
to
meet
and
satisfy
your
wishes
wherever
that
is
possible
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
is
certain
to
me
at
least
that
I
desire
not
to
undervalue
your
toil
and
your
suffering
.
<EOS>
Let
me
know
your
thoughts
.
<EOS>
But
where
can
we
meet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
thought
of
that
,
"
said
Mordecai
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
hard
for
you
to
come
into
this
neighborhood
later
in
the
evening
?
<EOS>
You
did
so
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
manage
it
very
well
occasionally
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
You
live
under
the
same
roof
with
the
Cohens
,
I
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Before
Mordecai
could
answer
,
Mr.
Ram
re
-
entered
to
take
his
place
behind
the
counter
.
<EOS>
He
was
an
elderly
son
of
Abraham
,
whose
childhood
had
fallen
on
the
evil
times
at
the
beginning
of
this
century
,
and
who
remained
amid
this
smart
and
instructed
generation
as
a
preserved
specimen
,
soaked
through
and
through
with
the
effect
of
the
poverty
and
contempt
which
were
the
common
heritage
of
most
English
Jews
seventy
years
ago
.
<EOS>
He
had
none
of
the
oily
cheerfulness
observable
in
Mr.
Cohen
's
aspect
:
<EOS>
his
very
features
 
broad
and
chubby
 
showed
that
tendency
to
look
mongrel
without
due
cause
,
which
,
in
a
miscellaneous
London
neighborhood
,
may
perhaps
be
compared
with
the
marvels
of
imitation
in
insects
,
and
may
have
been
nature
's
imperfect
effort
on
behalf
of
the
pure
Caucasian
to
shield
him
from
the
shame
and
spitting
to
which
purer
features
would
have
been
exposed
in
the
times
of
zeal
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Ram
dealt
ably
in
books
,
in
the
same
way
that
he
would
have
dealt
in
tins
of
meat
and
other
commodities
 
without
knowledge
or
responsibility
as
to
the
proportion
of
rottenness
or
nourishment
they
might
contain
.
<EOS>
But
he
believed
in
Mordecai
's
learning
as
something
marvellous
,
and
was
not
sorry
that
his
conversation
should
be
sought
by
a
bookish
gentleman
,
whose
visits
had
twice
ended
in
a
purchase
.
<EOS>
He
greeted
Deronda
with
a
crabbed
good
-
will
,
and
,
putting
on
large
silver
spectacles
,
appeared
at
once
to
abstract
himself
in
the
daily
accounts
.
  
<EOS>
But
Deronda
and
Mordecai
were
soon
in
the
street
together
,
and
without
any
explicit
agreement
as
to
their
direction
,
were
walking
toward
Ezra
Cohen
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
ca
n't
meet
there
:
my
room
is
too
narrow
,
"
said
Mordecai
,
taking
up
the
thread
of
talk
where
they
had
dropped
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
there
is
a
tavern
not
far
from
here
where
I
sometimes
go
to
a
club
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
_
Hand
and
Banner
_
,
in
the
street
at
the
next
turning
,
five
doors
down
.
<EOS>
We
can
have
the
parlor
there
any
evening
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
can
try
that
for
once
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
perhaps
let
me
provide
you
with
some
lodging
,
which
would
give
you
more
freedom
and
comfort
than
where
you
are
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
need
nothing
.
<EOS>
My
outer
life
is
as
nought
.
<EOS>
I
will
take
nothing
less
precious
from
you
than
your
soul
's
brotherhood
.
<EOS>
I
will
think
of
nothing
else
yet
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
glad
you
are
rich
.
<EOS>
You
did
not
need
money
on
that
diamond
ring
.
<EOS>
You
had
some
other
motive
for
bringing
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
was
a
little
startled
by
this
clear
-
sightedness
;
but
before
he
could
reply
Mordecai
added
 
<EOS>
"
it
is
all
one
.
<EOS>
Had
you
been
in
need
of
the
money
,
the
great
end
would
have
been
that
we
should
meet
again
.
<EOS>
But
you
are
rich
?
"
<EOS>
he
ended
,
in
a
tone
of
interrogation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
rich
,
except
in
the
sense
that
every
one
is
rich
who
has
more
than
he
needs
for
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
desired
that
your
life
should
be
free
,
"
said
Mordecai
,
dreamily
 
"
mine
has
been
a
bondage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
clear
that
he
had
no
interest
in
the
fact
of
Deronda
's
appearance
at
the
Cohens
'
beyond
its
relation
to
his
own
ideal
purpose
.
<EOS>
Despairing
of
leading
easily
up
to
the
question
he
wished
to
ask
,
Deronda
determined
to
put
it
abruptly
,
and
said
    
"
Can
you
tell
me
why
Mrs.
Cohen
,
the
mother
,
must
not
be
spoken
to
about
her
daughter
?
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
immediate
answer
,
and
he
thought
that
he
should
have
to
repeat
the
question
.
<EOS>
The
fact
was
that
Mordecai
had
heard
the
words
,
but
had
to
drag
his
mind
to
a
new
subject
away
from
his
passionate
preoccupation
.
<EOS>
After
a
few
moments
,
he
replied
with
a
careful
effort
such
as
he
would
have
used
if
he
had
been
asked
the
road
to
Holborn
      
<EOS>
"
I
know
the
reason
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
not
speak
even
of
trivial
family
affairs
which
I
have
heard
in
the
privacy
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
I
dwell
in
their
tent
as
in
a
sanctuary
.
<EOS>
Their
history
,
so
far
as
they
injure
none
other
,
is
their
own
possession
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
felt
the
blood
mounting
to
his
cheeks
as
a
sort
of
rebuke
<EOS>
he
was
little
used
to
,
and
he
also
found
himself
painfully
baffled
where
he
had
reckoned
with
some
confidence
on
getting
decisive
knowledge
.
<EOS>
He
became
the
more
conscious
of
emotional
strain
from
the
excitements
of
the
day
;
and
although
he
had
the
money
in
his
pocket
to
redeem
his
ring
,
he
recoiled
from
the
further
task
of
a
visit
to
the
Cohens
'
,
which
must
be
made
not
only
under
the
former
uncertainty
,
but
under
a
new
disappointment
as
to
the
possibility
of
its
removal
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
part
from
you
now
,
"
he
said
,
just
before
they
could
reach
Cohen
's
door
;
and
Mordecai
paused
,
looking
up
at
him
with
an
anxious
fatigued
face
under
the
gaslight
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
will
you
come
back
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
with
slow
emphasis
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
leave
that
unfixed
?
<EOS>
May
I
ask
for
you
at
the
Cohens
'
any
evening
after
your
hour
at
the
book
-
shop
?
<EOS>
There
is
no
objection
,
I
suppose
,
to
their
knowing
that
you
and
I
meet
in
private
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
,
"
said
Mordecai
.
<EOS>
"
But
the
days
I
wait
now
are
longer
than
the
years
of
my
strength
.
<EOS>
Life
shrinks
:
<EOS>
what
was
but
a
tithe
is
now
the
half
.
<EOS>
My
hope
abides
in
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
faithful
,
"
said
Deronda
 
<EOS>
he
could
not
have
left
those
words
unuttered
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
come
the
first
evening
<EOS>
I
can
after
seven
:
on
Saturday
or
Monday
,
if
possible
.
<EOS>
Trust
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
put
out
his
ungloved
hand
.
<EOS>
Mordecai
,
clasping
it
eagerly
,
seemed
to
feel
a
new
instreaming
of
confidence
,
and
he
said
with
some
recovered
energy
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
come
to
pass
,
and
the
rest
will
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
That
was
their
good
-
bye

REVELATIONS
      
<EOS>
"
This
,
too
is
probable
,
according
to
that
saying
of
Agathon
:
"
<EOS>
It
is
a
    
part
of
probability
that
many
improbable
things
will

<EOS>
Imagine
the
conflict
in
a
mind
like
<EOS>
Deronda
's
given
not
only
to
feel
strongly
but
to
question
actively
,
on
the
evening
after
the
interview
with
Mordecai
.
<EOS>
To
a
young
man
of
much
duller
susceptibilities
the
adventure
might
have
seemed
enough
out
of
the
common
way
to
divide
his
thoughts
;
but
it
had
stirred
Deronda
so
deeply
,
that
with
the
usual
reaction
of
his
intellect
he
began
to
examine
the
grounds
of
his
emotion
,
and
consider
how
far
he
must
resist
its
guidance
.
<EOS>
The
consciousness
that
he
was
half
dominated
by
Mordecai
's
energetic
certitude
,
and
still
more
by
his
fervent
trust
,
roused
his
alarm
.
<EOS>
It
was
his
characteristic
bias
to
shrink
from
the
moral
stupidity
of
valuing
<EOS>
lightly
what
had
come
close
to
him
,
and
of
missing
blindly
in
his
own
life
of
to
-
day
the
crisis
which
he
recognized
as
momentous
and
sacred
in
the
historic
life
of
men
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
read
of
this
incident
as
having
happened
centuries
ago
in
Rome
,
Greece
,
Asia
Minor
,
Palestine
,
Cairo
,
to
some
man
young
as
himself
,
dissatisfied
with
his
neutral
life
,
and
wanting
some
closer
fellowship
,
some
more
special
duty
to
give
him
ardor
for
the
possible
consequences
of
his
work
,
it
would
have
appeared
to
him
quite
natural
that
the
incident
should
have
created
a
deep
impression
on
that
far
-
off
man
,
whose
clothing
and
action
would
have
been
seen
in
his
imagination
as
part
of
an
age
chiefly
known
to
us
through
its
more
serious
effects
.
<EOS>
Why
should
he
be
ashamed
of
his
own
agitated
feeling
merely
because
he
dressed
for
dinner
,
wore
a
white
tie
,
and
lived
among
people
who
might
laugh
at
his
owning
any
conscience
in
the
matter
,
as
the
solemn
folly
of
taking
himself
too
seriously
?
 
<EOS>
that
bugbear
of
circles
in
which
the
lack
of
grave
emotion
passes
for
wit
.
<EOS>
From
such
cowardice
before
modish
ignorance
and
obtuseness
,
Deronda
shrank
.
<EOS>
But
he
also
shrank
from
having
his
course
determined
by
mere
contagion
,
without
consent
of
reason
;
or
from
allowing
a
reverential
pity
for
spiritual
struggle
to
hurry
him
along
a
dimly
-
seen
path
.
  
<EOS>
What
,
after
all
,
had
really
happened
?
<EOS>
He
knew
quite
accurately
the
answer
Sir
Hugo
would
have
given
:
"
A
consumptive
Jew
,
possessed
by
a
fanaticism
which
obstacles
and
hastening
death
intensified
,
had
fixed
on
Deronda
as
the
antitype
of
some
visionary
image
,
the
offspring
of
wedded
hope
and
despair
:
despair
of
his
own
life
,
irrepressible
hope
in
the
propagation
of
his
fanatical
beliefs
.
<EOS>
The
instance
was
perhaps
odd
,
exceptional
in
its
form
,
but
substantially
it
was
not
rare
.
<EOS>
Fanaticism
was
not
so
common
as
bankruptcy
,
but
taken
in
all
its
aspects
it
was
abundant
enough
.
<EOS>
While
Mordecai
was
waiting
on
the
bridge
for
the
fulfillment
of
his
visions
,
another
man
was
convinced
that
he
had
the
mathematical
key
of
the
universe
which
would
supersede
Newton
,
and
regarded
all
known
physicists
as
conspiring
to
stifle
his
discovery
and
keep
the
universe
locked
;
another
,
that
he
had
the
metaphysical
key
,
with
just
that
hair's
-
breadth
of
difference
from
the
old
wards
which
would
make
it
fit
exactly
.
<EOS>
Scattered
here
and
there
in
every
direction
you
might
find
a
terrible
person
,
with
more
or
less
power
of
speech
,
and
with
an
eye
either
glittering
or
preternaturally
dull
,
on
the
look
-
out
for
the
man
who
must
hear
him
;
and
in
most
cases
he
had
volumes
which
it
was
difficult
to
get
printed
,
or
if
printed
to
get
read
.
<EOS>
This
Mordecai
happened
to
have
a
more
pathetic
aspect
,
a
more
passionate
,
penetrative
speech
than
was
usual
with
such
monomaniacs
;
he
was
more
poetical
than
a
social
reformer
with
colored
views
of
the
new
moral
world
in
parallelograms
,
or
than
an
enthusiast
in
sewage
;
still
he
came
under
the
same
class
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
only
right
and
kind
to
indulge
him
a
little
,
to
comfort
him
with
such
help
as
was
practicable
;
but
what
likelihood
was
there
that
his
notions
had
the
sort
of
value
he
ascribed
to
them
?
<EOS>
In
such
cases
a
man
of
the
world
knows
what
to
think
beforehand
.
<EOS>
And
as
to
Mordecai
's
conviction
that
he
had
found
a
new
executive
self
,
it
might
be
preparing
for
him
the
worst
of
disappointments
 
that
which
presents
itself
as
final
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
's
ear
caught
all
these
negative
whisperings
;
nay
,
he
repeated
them
distinctly
to
himself
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
the
first
<EOS>
but
it
was
the
most
pressing
occasion
on
which
he
had
had
to
face
this
question
of
the
family
likeness
among
the
heirs
of
enthusiasm
,
whether
prophets
or
dreamers
of
dreams
,
whether
the
    
"
Great
benefactors
of
mankind
,
deliverers
,
"
  
or
the
devotees
of
phantasmal
discovery
 
from
the
first
believer
in
his
own
unmanifested
inspiration
,
down
to
the
last
inventor
of
an
ideal
machine
that
will
achieve
perpetual
motion
.
<EOS>
The
kinship
of
human
passion
,
the
sameness
of
mortal
scenery
,
inevitably
fill
fact
with
burlesque
and
parody
.
<EOS>
Error
and
folly
have
had
their
hecatombs
of
martyrs
.
<EOS>
Reduce
the
grandest
type
of
man
hitherto
known
to
an
abstract
statement
of
his
qualities
and
efforts
,
and
he
appears
in
dangerous
company
:
say
that
,
like
Copernicus
and
Galileo
,
he
was
immovably
convinced
in
the
face
of
hissing
incredulity
;
but
so
is
the
contriver
of
perpetual
motion
.
<EOS>
We
can
not
fairly
try
the
spirits
by
this
sort
of
test
.
<EOS>
If
we
want
to
avoid
giving
the
dose
of
hemlock
or
the
sentence
of
banishment
in
the
wrong
case
,
nothing
will
do
but
a
capacity
to
understand
the
subject
-
matter
on
which
the
immovable
man
is
convinced
,
and
fellowship
with
human
travail
,
both
near
and
afar
,
to
hinder
us
from
scanning
and
deep
experience
lightly
.
<EOS>
Shall
we
say
,
"
Let
the
ages
try
the
spirits
,
and
see
what
they
are
worth
?
<EOS>
"
Why
,
we
are
the
beginning
of
the
ages
,
which
can
only
be
just
by
virtue
of
just
judgments
in
separate
human
breasts
 
separate
yet
combined
.
<EOS>
Even
steam
-
engines
could
not
have
got
made
without
that
condition
,
but
must
have
stayed
in
the
mind
of
James
Watt
.
  
<EOS>
This
track
of
thinking
was
familiar
enough
to
Deronda
to
have
saved
him
from
any
contemptuous
prejudgment
of
Mordecai
,
even
if
their
communication
had
been
free
from
that
peculiar
claim
on
himself
strangely
ushered
in
by
some
long
-
growing
preparation
in
the
Jew
's
agitated
mind
.
<EOS>
This
claim
,
indeed
,
considered
in
what
is
called
a
rational
way
,
might
seem
justifiably
dismissed
as
illusory
and
even
preposterous
;
but
it
was
precisely
what
turned
Mordecai
's
hold
on
him
from
an
appeal
to
his
ready
sympathy
into
a
clutch
on
his
struggling
conscience
.
<EOS>
Our
consciences
are
not
all
of
the
same
pattern
,
an
inner
deliverance
of
fixed
laws
:
they
are
the
voice
of
sensibilities
as
various
as
our
memories
(
which
also
have
their
kinship
and
likeness
)
.
<EOS>
And
Deronda
's
conscience
included
sensibilities
beyond
the
common
,
enlarged
by
his
early
habit
of
thinking
himself
imaginatively
into
the
experience
of
others
.
  
<EOS>
What
was
the
claim
this
eager
soul
made
upon
him
?
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
believe
my
beliefs
 
be
moved
by
my
reasons
 
<EOS>
hope
my
hopes
 
see
the
vision
I
point
to
 
behold
a
glory
where
I
behold
it
!
"
<EOS>
To
take
such
a
demand
in
the
light
of
an
obligation
in
any
direct
sense
would
have
been
preposterous
 
to
have
seemed
to
admit
it
would
have
been
dishonesty
;
and
Deronda
,
looking
on
the
agitation
of
those
moments
,
felt
thankful
that
in
the
midst
of
his
compassion
he
had
preserved
himself
from
the
bondage
of
false
concessions
.
<EOS>
The
claim
hung
,
too
,
on
a
supposition
which
might
be
 
nay
,
probably
was
 
in
discordance
with
the
full
fact
:
the
supposition
that
he
,
Deronda
,
was
of
Jewish
blood
.
<EOS>
Was
there
ever
a
more
hypothetic
appeal
?
  
<EOS>
But
since
the
age
of
thirteen
Deronda
had
associated
the
deepest
experience
of
his
affections
with
what
was
a
pure
supposition
,
namely
,
that
Sir
Hugo
was
his
father
<EOS>
:
that
was
a
hypothesis
which
had
been
the
source
of
passionate
struggle
within
him
;
by
its
light
he
had
been
accustomed
to
subdue
feelings
and
to
cherish
them
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
well
used
to
find
a
motive
in
a
conception
which
might
be
disproved
;
and
he
had
been
also
used
to
think
of
some
revelation
that
might
influence
his
view
of
the
particular
duties
belonging
to
him
.
<EOS>
To
be
in
a
state
of
suspense
,
which
was
also
one
of
emotive
activity
and
scruple
,
was
a
familiar
attitude
of
his
conscience
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
,
suppose
that
wish
-
begotten
belief
in
his
Jewish
birth
,
and
that
extravagant
demand
of
discipleship
,
to
be
the
foreshadowing
of
an
actual
discovery
and
a
genuine
spiritual
result
:
suppose
that
Mordecai
's
ideas
made
a
real
conquest
over
Deronda
's
conviction
?
<EOS>
Nay
,
it
was
conceivable
that
as
Mordecai
needed
and
believed
that
,
he
had
found
an
active
replenishment
of
himself
,
so
Deronda
might
receive
from
Mordecai
's
mind
the
complete
ideal
shape
of
that
personal
duty
and
citizenship
which
lay
in
his
own
thought
like
sculptured
fragments
certifying
some
beauty
yearned
after
but
not
traceable
by
divination
.
  
<EOS>
As
that
possibility
presented
itself
in
his
meditations
,
he
was
aware
that
it
would
be
called
dreamy
,
and
began
to
defend
it
.
<EOS>
If
the
influence
he
imagined
himself
submitting
to
had
been
that
of
some
honored
professor
,
some
authority
in
a
seat
of
learning
,
some
philosopher
who
had
been
accepted
as
a
voice
of
the
age
,
would
a
thorough
receptiveness
toward
direction
have
been
ridiculed
?
<EOS>
Only
by
those
who
hold
it
a
sign
of
weakness
to
be
obliged
for
an
idea
,
and
prefer
to
hint
that
they
have
implicitly
held
in
a
more
correct
form
whatever
others
have
stated
with
a
sadly
short
-
coming
explicitness
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
what
was
there
but
vulgarity
in
taking
the
fact
that
Mordecai
was
a
poor
Jewish
workman
,
and
that
he
was
to
be
met
perhaps
on
a
sanded
floor
in
the
parlor
of
the
_
Hand
and
Banner
_
as
a
reason
for
determining
beforehand
that
there
was
not
some
spiritual
force
within
him
that
might
have
a
determining
effect
on
a
white
-
handed
gentleman
?
<EOS>
There
is
a
legend
told
of
the
Emperor
Domitian
,
that
having
heard
of
a
Jewish
family
,
of
the
house
of
David
,
whence
the
ruler
of
the
world
was
to
spring
,
he
sent
for
its
members
in
alarm
,
but
quickly
released
them
on
observing
that
they
had
the
hands
of
work
-
people
 
being
of
just
the
opposite
opinion
with
that
Rabbi
who
stood
waiting
at
the
gate
of
Rome
in
confidence
that
the
Messiah
would
be
found
among
the
destitute
who
entered
there
.
<EOS>
Both
Emperor
and
Rabbi
were
wrong
in
their
trust
of
outward
signs
:
<EOS>
poverty
and
poor
clothes
are
no
sign
of
inspiration
,
said
Deronda
to
his
inward
objector
,
but
they
have
gone
with
it
in
some
remarkable
cases
.
<EOS>
And
to
regard
discipleship
as
out
of
the
question
because
of
them
,
would
be
mere
dullness
of
imagination
.
  
<EOS>
A
more
plausible
reason
for
putting
discipleship
out
of
the
question
was
the
strain
of
visionary
excitement
in
Mordecai
,
which
turned
his
wishes
into
overmastering
impressions
,
and
made
him
read
outward
facts
as
fulfillment
.
<EOS>
Was
such
a
temper
of
mind
likely
to
accompany
that
wise
estimate
of
consequences
which
is
the
only
safeguard
from
fatal
error
,
even
to
ennobling
motive
?
<EOS>
But
it
remained
to
be
seen
whether
that
rare
conjunction
existed
or
not
in
Mordecai
:
perhaps
his
might
be
one
of
the
natures
where
a
wise
estimate
of
consequences
is
fused
in
the
fires
of
that
passionate
belief
which
determines
the
consequences
it
believes
in
.
<EOS>
The
inspirations
of
the
world
have
come
in
that
way
too
:
even
strictly
-
measuring
science
could
hardly
have
got
on
without
that
forecasting
ardor
which
feels
the
agitations
of
discovery
beforehand
,
and
has
a
faith
in
its
preconception
that
surmounts
many
failures
of
experiment
.
<EOS>
And
in
relation
to
human
motives
and
actions
,
passionate
belief
has
a
fuller
efficacy
.
<EOS>
Here
enthusiasm
may
have
the
validity
of
proof
,
and
happening
in
one
soul
,
give
the
type
of
what
will
one
day
be
general
.
  
<EOS>
At
least
,
Deronda
argued
,
Mordecai
's
visionary
excitability
was
hardly
a
reason
for
concluding
beforehand
that
he
was
not
worth
listening
to
except
for
pity
sake
.
<EOS>
Suppose
he
had
introduced
himself
as
one
of
the
strictest
reasoners
.
<EOS>
Do
they
form
a
body
of
men
hitherto
free
from
false
conclusions
and
illusory
speculations
?
<EOS>
The
driest
argument
has
its
hallucinations
,
too
hastily
concluding
that
its
net
will
now
at
last
be
large
enough
to
hold
the
universe
.
<EOS>
Men
may
dream
in
demonstrations
,
and
cut
out
an
illusory
world
in
the
shape
of
axioms
,
definitions
,
and
propositions
,
with
a
final
exclusion
of
fact

No

for
thinking
will
save
us
mortals
from
mistake
in
our
imperfect
apprehension
of
the
matter
to
be
thought
about

<EOS>
And
since
the
unemotional
intellect
may
carry
us
into
a
mathematical
dreamland
where
nothing
is
but
what
is
not
,
perhaps
an
emotional
intellect
may
have
absorbed
into
its
passionate
vision
of
possibilities
some
truth
of
what
will
be
 
the
more
comprehensive

feeding

with
new

At
any
rate

presumptions
to

contrary
are
not

We
must

patient
with
the
inevitable
makeshift

our
human
thinking

whether
in
its
sum
total

in
the
separate
minds
that
have
made
the
sum

Columbus
had
some
impressions
about
himself
which
we
call
superstitions
,
and
used
some
arguments
which
we
disapprove
;
but
he
had
also
some
sound
physical
conceptions
,
and
he
had
the
passionate
patience
of
genius
to
make
them
tell
on
mankind
.
<EOS>
The
world
has
made
up
its
mind
rather
contemptuously
about
those
who
were
deaf
to
Columbus

"
My
contempt
for

binds
me
to
see
that
I
do
n't
adopt
their

on
a
small

said
Deronda
,
"
and
make
myself
deaf
with
the
assumption
that
there
can
not
be
any
momentous
relation
between
this
Jew
and
me

simply
because
he
has
clad
it
in
illusory
notions
.
<EOS>
What
I
can
be
to
him
,
or
he
to
me
,
may
not
at
all
depend
on
his
persuasion
about
the
way
we
came
together

<EOS>
To
me
the
way
seems
made
up
of
plainly
discernible
links

If
I
had
not
found
Mirah
,
it
is
probable
that
I
should
not
have
begun
to
be
specially
interested
in
the
Jews
,
and
certainly
I
should
not
have
gone
on
that
loitering
search
after
an
Ezra
Cohen
which
made
me
pause
at
Ram
's
book
-
shop
and
ask
the
price
of
_

<EOS>
Mordecai
,
on
his
side
,
had
his
visions
of
a
disciple
,
and
he
saw
me
by
their
light
;
I
corresponded
well
enough
with
the
image
his
longing
had
created
.
<EOS>
He
took
me
for
one
of
his
race
.
<EOS>
Suppose
that
his
impression
 
the
elderly
Jew
at
Frankfort
seemed
to
have
something
like
it
 
suppose
in
spite
of
all
presumptions
to
the
contrary
,
that
his
impression
should
somehow
be
proved
true
,
and
that
I
should
come
actually
to
share
any
of
the
ideas
he
is
devoted
to
?
<EOS>
This
is
the
only
question
which
really
concerns
the
effect

our
meeting
on
my

But
if
the
issue
should
be
quite
different
?
 
<EOS>
well
,
there
will
be
something
painful
to
go
through
.
<EOS>
I
shall
almost
inevitably
have
to
be
an
active
cause
of
that
poor
fellow
's
crushing
disappointment
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
this
issue
is
the
one
I
had
need
prepare
myself
for
.
<EOS>
I
fear
that
no
tenderness
of
mine
can
make
his
suffering
lighter
.
<EOS>
Would
the
alternative
 
that
I
should
not
disappoint
him
 
be
less
painful
to
me

<EOS>
Here
Deronda
wavered
.
<EOS>
Feelings
had
lately
been
at
work
within
him
which
had
very
much
modified
the
reluctance
he
would
formerly
have
had
to
think
of
himself
as
probably
a
Jew
.
<EOS>
And
,
if
you
like
,
he
was
romantic

That
young
energy
and
spirit
of
adventure

have

wide
legions
of
youthful
heroes
going
to
seek
the
hidden
tokens
of
their

its

gave
him
a

quivering
interest
in
the
bare
possibility
that
he
was
entering
on
a
track

He
could
not
admit
it
to
be
more
.

The
belief
that
his
father
was
an
Englishman
only
grew
firmer
under
the
weak
assaults
of
unwarranted
doubt

<EOS>
And
that
a
moment
should
ever
come
in
which
that
belief
was
declared
a

was
something

His
life
-
long
affection
for
Sir
Hugo
,
stronger
than
all
his
resentment
,
made
him
shrink
from
admitting
that
wish
.
  
<EOS>
Which
way
soever
the
truth
might
lie
,
he
repeated
to
himself
what
he
had
said
to
Mordecai
 
that
he
could
not
without
farther
reasons
undertake
to
hasten
its
discovery
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
he
was
tempted
now
to
regard
his
uncertainty
as
a
condition
to
be
cherished
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
If
further
intercourse
revealed
nothing
but
illusions
as
what
he
was
expected
to
share
in
,
the
want
of
any
valid
evidence
that
he
was
a
Jew
might
save
Mordecai
the
worst
shock
in
the
refusal
of
fraternity
.
<EOS>
It
might
even
be
justifiable
to
use
the
uncertainty
on
this
point
in
keeping
up
a
suspense
which
would
induce
Mordecai
to
accept
those
offices
of
friendship
that
Deronda
longed
to
urge
on
him
.
  
<EOS>
These
were
the
meditations
that
busied
Deronda
in
the
interval
of
four
days
before
he
could
fulfill
his
promise
to
call
for
Mordecai
at
Ezra
Cohen
's
,
Sir
Hugo
's
demands
on
him
often
lasting
to
an
hour
so
late
as
to
put
the
evening
expedition
to
Holborn
out
of
the

Deronda
had
lately
been
reading
that
passage
of
Zunz
,
and
it
occurred
to
him
by
way
of
contrast
when
he
was
going
to
the
Cohens
,
who
certainly
bore
no
obvious
stamp
of
distinction
in
sorrow
or
in
any
other
form
of
aristocracy

<EOS>
Ezra
Cohen
was
not
clad
in
the
sublime
pathos
of
the
martyr
,
and
his
taste
for
money
-
getting
seemed
to
be
favored
with
that
success
which
has
been
the
most
exasperating
difference
in
the
greed
of
Jews
during
all

<EOS>
This
Jeshurun
of
a
pawnbroker
was
not
a
symbol
of
the
great
Jewish
tragedy
;
and
yet
was
there
not
something
typical
in
the
fact
that
a
life
like
Mordecai
's
 
a
frail
incorporation
of
the
national
consciousness
,
breathing
with
difficult
breath
 
was
nested
in
the
self
-
gratulating
ignorant
prosperity
of
the
Cohens
?
  
<EOS>
Glistening
was
the
gladness
in
their
faces
when
Deronda
reappeared
among
them
.
<EOS>
Cohen
himself
took
occasion
to
intimate
that
although
the
diamond
ring
,
let
alone
a
little
longer
,
would
have
bred
more
money
,
he
did
not
mind
_
<EOS>
that
_
 
not
a
sixpence
 
<EOS>
when
compared
with
the
pleasure
of
the
women
and
children
in
seeing
a
young
gentleman
whose
first
visit
had
been
so
agreeable
that
they

Young
Mrs.
Cohen
was
very
sorry
that
baby
was
asleep
,
and
then
very
glad
that
Adelaide
was
not
yet
gone
to
bed
,
entreating
Deronda
not
to
stay
in
the
shop
,
but
to
go
forthwith
into
the
parlor
to
see
"
mother
and
the
children
.
"
<EOS>
He
willingly
accepted
the
invitation
,
having
provided
himself
with
portable
presents
;
a
set
of
paper
figures
for
Adelaide
,
and
an
ivory
cup
and
ball
for
Jacob
.
  
<EOS>
The
grandmother
had
a
pack
of
cards
before
her
and
was
making
"
plates
"
with
the
children
.
<EOS>
A
plate
had
just
been
thrown
down
and
kept
itself
whole
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stop
!
"
said
Jacob
,
running
to
Deronda
as
he
entered
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
tread
on
my
plate
.
<EOS>
Stop
and
see
me
throw
it
up
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
complied
,
exchanging
a
smile
of
understanding
with
the
grandmother
,
and
the
plate
bore
several
tossings
before
it
came
to
pieces
;
then
the
visitor
was
allowed
to
come
forward
and
seat
himself
.
<EOS>
He
observed
that
the
door
from
which
Mordecai
had
issued
on
the
former
visit
was
now
closed
,
but
he
wished
to
show
his
interest
in
the
Cohens
before
disclosing
a
yet
stronger
interest
in
their
singular
inmate
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
until
he
had
Adelaide
on
his
knee
,
and
was
setting
up
the
paper
figures
in
their
dance
on
the
table
,
while
Jacob
was
already
practicing
with
the
cup
and
ball
,
that
Deronda
said
    
"
Is
Mordecai
in
just
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
he
,
Addy
?
"
said
Cohen
,
who
had
seized
an
interval
of
business
to
come
and
look
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
workroom
there
,
"
said
his
wife
,
nodding
toward
the
closed
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
fact
is
,
sir
,
"
said
Cohen
,
"
we
do
n't
know
what
's
come
to
him
this
last
day
or
two
.
<EOS>
He
's
always
what
I
may
call
a
little
touched
,
you
know
"
 
here
<EOS>
Cohen
pointed
to
his
own
forehead
 
"
not
quite
so
rational
in
all
things
,
like
you
and
me
;
but
he
's
mostly
wonderful
regular
and
industrious
so
far
as
a
poor
creature
can
be
,
and
takes
as
much
delight
in
the
boy
as
anybody
could
.
<EOS>
But
this
last
day
or
two
he
's
been
moving
about
like
a
sleep
-
walker
,
or
else
sitting
as
still
as
a
wax
figure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
disease
,
poor
dear
creature
,
"
said
the
grandmother
,
tenderly
.
<EOS>
"
I
doubt
whether
he
can
stand
long
against
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
<EOS>
;
I
think
its
only
something
he
's
got
in
his
head
.
"
said
Mrs.
Cohen
the
younger
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
been
turning
over
writing
continually
,
and
when
I
speak
to
him
it
takes
him
ever
so
long
to
hear
and
answer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
think
us
a
little
weak
ourselves
,
"
said
Cohen
,
apologetically
.
<EOS>
"
But
my
wife
and
mother
would
n't
part
with
him
if
he
was
a
still
worse
encumbrance
.
<EOS>
It
is
n't
that
we
do
n't
know
the
long
and
short
of
matters
,
but
it
's
our
principle
.
<EOS>
There
's
fools
do
business
at
a
loss
and
do
n't
know
it
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
one
of
'
em
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mordecai
carries
a
blessing
inside
him
,
"
said
the
grandmother
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
got
something
the
matter
inside
him
,
"
said
Jacob
,
coming
up
to
correct
this
erratum
of
his
grandmother
's
.
"
<EOS>
He
said
he
could
n't
talk
to
me
,
and
he
would
n't
have
a
bit
o
'
bun
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
So
far
from
wondering
at
your
feeling
for
him
,
"
said
Deronda
,
"
I
already
feel
something
of
the
same
sort
myself
.
<EOS>
I
have
lately
talked
to
him
at
Ram
's
book
-
shop
 
in
fact
,
I
promised
to
call
for
him
here
,
that
we
might
go
out
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
it
,
then
!
<EOS>
"
said
Cohen
,
slapping
his
knee
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
been
expecting
you
,
and
it
's
taken
hold
of
him
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
talks
about
his
learning
to
you
.
<EOS>
It
's
uncommonly
kind
of
_
you
_
,
sir
;
for
I
do
n't
suppose
there
's
much
to
be
got
out
of
it
,
else
it
would
n't
have
left
him
where
he
is
.
<EOS>
But
there
's
the
shop
.
"
<EOS>
Cohen
hurried
out
,
and
Jacob
,
who
had
been
listening
inconveniently
near
to
Deronda
's
elbow
,
said
to
him
with
obliging
familiarity
,
"
I
'll
call
Mordecai
for
you
,
if
you
like
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Jacob
,
"
said
his
mother
;
"
open
the
door
for
the
gentleman
,
and
let
him
go
in
himself
Hush
!
<EOS>
do
n't
make
a
noise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Skillful
Jacob
seemed
to
enter
into
the
play
,
and
turned
the
handle
of
the
door
as
noiselessly
as
possible
,
while
Deronda
went
behind
him
and
stood
on
the
threshold
.
<EOS>
The
small
room
was
lit
only
by
a
dying
fire
and
one
candle
with
a
shade
over
it
.
<EOS>
On
the
board
fixed
under
the
window
,
various
objects
of
jewelry
were
scattered
:
some
books
were
heaped
in
the
corner
beyond
them
.
<EOS>
Mordecai
was
seated
on
a
high
chair
at
the
board
with
his
back
to
the
door
,
his
hands
resting
on
each
other
and
on
the
board
,
a
watch
propped
on
a
stand
before
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
a
state
of
expectation
as
sickening
as
that
of
a
prisoner
listening
for
the
delayed
deliverance
 
when
he
heard
Deronda
's
voice
saying
,
"
I
am
come
for
you
.
<EOS>
Are
you
ready
?
"
  
<EOS>
Immediately
he
turned
without
speaking
,
seized
his
furred
cap
which
lay
near
,
and
moved
to
join
Deronda
.
<EOS>
It
was
but
a
moment
before
they
were
both
in
the
sitting
-
room
,
and
Jacob
,
noticing
the
change
in
his
friend
's
air
and
expression
,
seized
him
by
the
arm
and
said
,
"
See
my
cup
and
ball
!
<EOS>
"
sending
the
ball
up
close
to
Mordecai
's
face
,
as
something
likely
to
cheer
a
convalescent
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
sign
of
the
relieved
tension
in
Mordecai
's
mind
that
he
could
smile
and
say
,
"
Fine
,
fine
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
forgotten
your
greatcoat
and
comforter
,
"
said
young
Mrs.
Cohen
,
and
he
went
back
into
the
work
-
room
and
got
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
come
to
life
again
,
do
you
see
?
"
said
Cohen
,
who
had
re
-
entered
 
speaking
in
an
undertone
.
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
so
:
I
'm
mostly
right
.
"
<EOS>
Then
in
his
usual
voice
,
"
Well
,
sir
,
we
must
n't
detain
you
now
,
I
suppose
;
but
I
hope
this
is
n't
the
last
time
we
shall
see
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
you
come
again
?
"
said
Jacob
,
advancing
.
<EOS>
"
See
,
I
can
catch
the
ball
;
I
'll
bet
I
catch
it
without
stopping
,
if
you
come
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
clever
hands
,
"
said
Deronda
,
looking
at
the
grandmother
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Which
side
of
the
family
does
he
get
them
from
?
"
  
<EOS>
But
the
grandmother
only
nodded
towards
her
son
,
who
said
promptly
,
"
My
side
.
<EOS>
My
wife
's
family
are
not
in
that
line
.
<EOS>
But
bless
your
soul
!
<EOS>
ours
is
a
sort
of
cleverness
as
good
as
gutta
percha
;
you
can
twist
it
which
way
you
like
.
<EOS>
There
's
nothing
some
old
gentlemen
wo
n't
do
if
you
set
'em
to
it
.
"
<EOS>
Here
Cohen
winked
down
at
Jacob
's
back
,
but
it
was
doubtful
whether
this
judicious
allusiveness
answered
its
purpose
,
for
its
subject
gave
a
nasal
whinnying
laugh
and
stamped
about
singing
,
"
Old
gentlemen
,
old
gentlemen
,
"
in
chiming
cadence
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
thought
,
"
I
shall
never
know
anything
decisive
about
these
people
until
I
ask
Cohen
pointblank
whether
he
lost
a
sister
named
Mirah
when
she
was
six
years
old
.
<EOS>
"
The
decisive
moment
did
not
yet
seem
easy
for
him
to
face
.
<EOS>
Still
his
first
sense
of
repulsion
at
the
commonness
of
these
people
was
beginning
to
be
tempered
with
kindlier
feeling
.
<EOS>
However
unrefined
their
airs
and
speech
might
be
,
he
was
forced
to
admit
some
moral
refinement
in
their
treatment
of
the
consumptive
workman
,
whose
mental
distinction
impressed
them
chiefly
as
a
harmless
,
silent
raving
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
Cohens
seem
to
have
an
affection
for
you
,
"
said
Deronda
,
as
soon
as
he
and
Mordecai
were
off
the
doorstep
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
for
them
,
"
was
the
immediate
answer
.
<EOS>
"
They
have
the
heart
of
the
Israelite
within
them
,
though
they
are
as
the
horse
and
the
mule
,
without
understanding
beyond
the
narrow
path
they
tread
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
caused
you
some
uneasiness
,
I
fear
,
"
said
Deronda
,
"
by
my
slowness
in
fulfilling
my
promise
.
<EOS>
I
wished
to
come
yesterday
,
but
I
found
it
impossible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
 
yes
,
I
trusted
you
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
true
I
have
been
uneasy
,
for
the
spirit
of
my
youth
has
been
stirred
within
me
,
and
this
body
is
not
strong
enough
to
bear
the
beating
of
its
wings
.
<EOS>
I
am
as
a
man
bound
and
imprisoned
through
long
years
:
<EOS>
behold
him
brought
to
speech
of
his
fellow
and
his
limbs
set
free
:
<EOS>
he
weeps
,
he
totters
,
the
joy
within
him
threatens
to
break
and
overthrow
the
tabernacle
of
flesh
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
speak
too
much
in
this
evening
air
,
"
said
Deronda
,
feeling
Mordecai
's
words
of
reliance
like
so
many
cords
binding
him
painfully
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Cover
your
mouth
with
the
woolen
scarf

<EOS>
We
are
going
to
the
_
Hand
and
Banner
_
,
I
suppose
,
and
shall
be
in
private
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
that
is
my
trouble
that
you
did
not
come
yesterday
.
<EOS>
For
this
is
the
evening
of
the
club
I
spoke
of
,
and
we
might
not
have
any
minutes
alone
until
late
,
when
all
the
rest
are
gone
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
we
had
better
seek
another
place
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
used
to
that
only
.
<EOS>
In
new
places
the
outer
world
presses
on
me
and
narrows
the
inward
vision
.
<EOS>
And
the
people
there
are
familiar
with
my
face
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mind
the
club
if
I
am
allowed
to
go
in
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
enough
that
you
like
this
place
best
.
<EOS>
If
we
have
not
enough
time
I
will
come
again
.
<EOS>
What
sort
of
club
is
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
called
"
The
Philosophers
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
few
 
like
the
cedars
of
Lebanon
 
poor
men
given
to
thought
.
<EOS>
But
none
so
poor
as
I
am
:
and
sometimes
visitors
of
higher
worldly
rank
have
been
brought
.
<EOS>
We
are
allowed
to
introduce
a
friend
,
who
is
interested
in
our
topics
.
<EOS>
Each
orders
beer
or
some
other
kind
of
drink
,
in
payment
for
the
room
.
<EOS>
Most
of
them
smoke
.
<EOS>
I
have
gone
when
I
could
,
for
there
are
other
men
of
my
race
who
come
,
and
sometimes
I
have
broken
silence
.
<EOS>
I
have
pleased
myself
with
a
faint
likeness
between
these
poor
philosophers
and
the
Masters
who
handed
down
the
thought
of
our
race
 
the
great
Transmitters
,
who
labored
with
their
hands
for
scant
bread
,
but
preserved
and
enlarged
for
us
the
heritage
of
memory
,
and
saved
the
soul
of
Israel
alive
as
a
seed
among
the
tombs
.
<EOS>
The
heart
pleases
itself
with
faint
resemblances
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
very
glad
to
go
and
sit
among
them
,
if
that
will
suit
you
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
sort
of
meeting
I
should
like
to
join
in
,
"
said
Deronda
,
not
without
relief
in
the
prospect
of
an
interval
before
he
went
through
the
strain
of
his
next
private
conversation
with
Mordecai
.
  
<EOS>
In
three
minutes
they
had
opened
the
glazed
door
with
the
red
curtain
,
and
were
in
the
little
parlor
,
hardly
much
more
than
fifteen
feet
square
,
where
the
gaslight
shone
through
a
slight
haze
of
smoke
on
what
to
Deronda
was
a
new
and
striking
scene
.
<EOS>
Half
-
a
-
dozen
men
of
various
ages
,
from
between
twenty
and
thirty
to
fifty
,
all
shabbily
dressed
,
most
of
them
with
clay
pipes
in
their
mouths
,
were
listening
with
a
look
of
concentrated
intelligence
to
a
man
in
a
pepper
-
and
-
salt
dress
,
with
blonde
hair
,
short
nose
,
broad
forehead
and
general
breadth
,
who
,
holding
his
pipe
slightly
uplifted
in
the
left
hand
,
and
beating
his
knee
with
the
right
,
was
just
finishing
a
quotation
from
Shelley
(
the
comparison
of
the
avalanche
in
his
"
Prometheus
Unbound
"
)
    
<EOS>
"
As
thought
by
thought
is
piled
,
till
some
great
truth
  
Is
loosened
,
and
the
nations
echo
round
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
entrance
of
the
new
-
comers
broke
the
fixity
of
attention
,
and
called
for
re
-
arrangement
of
seats
in
the
too
narrow
semicircle
round
the
fire
-
place
and
the
table
holding
the
glasses
,
spare
pipes
and
tobacco
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
soberest
of
clubs
;
but
sobriety
is
no
reason
why
smoking
and
"
taking
something
"
should
be
less
imperiously
needed
as
a
means
of
getting
a
decent
status
in
company
and
debate
.
<EOS>
Mordecai
was
received
with
welcoming
voices
which
had
a
slight
cadence
of
compassion
in
them
,
but
naturally
all
glances
passed
immediately
to
his
companion
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
brought
a
friend
who
is
interested
in
our
subjects
,
"
said
Mordecai
.
<EOS>
"
He
has
traveled
and
studied
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Is
the
gentlemen
anonymous
?
<EOS>
Is
he
a
Great
"
Unknown
?
"
<EOS>
"
said
the
broad
-
chested
quoter
of
Shelley
,
with
a
humorous
air
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
name
is
Daniel
Deronda
.
<EOS>
I
am
unknown
,
but
not
in
any
sense
great
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
smile
breaking
over
the
stranger
's
grave
face
as
he
said
this
was
so
agreeable
that
there
was
a
general
indistinct
murmur
,
equivalent
to
a
"
Hear
,
hear
,
"
and
<EOS>
the
broad
man
said
    
"
You
recommend
the
name
,
sir
,
and
are
welcome
.
<EOS>
Here
,
Mordecai
,
come
to
this
corner
against
me
,
"
he
added
,
evidently
wishing
to
give
the
coziest
place
to
the
one
who
most
needed
it
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
was
well
satisfied
to
get
a
seat
on
the
opposite
side
,
where
his
general
survey
of
the
party
easily
included
Mordecai
,
who
remained
an
eminently
striking
object
in
this
group
of
sharply
-
characterized
figures
,
more
than
one
of
whom
,
even
to
Daniel
's
little
exercised
discrimination
,
seemed
probably
of
Jewish
descent
.
  
<EOS>
In
fact
pure
English
blood
(
if
leech
or
lancet
can
furnish
us
with
the
precise
product
)
did
not
declare
itself
predominantly
in
the
party
at
present
assembled
.
<EOS>
Miller
,
the
broad
man
,
an
exceptional
second
-
hand
bookseller
who
knew
the
insides
of
books
,
had
at
least
grand
-
parents
who
called
themselves
German
,
and
possibly
far
-
away
ancestors
who
denied
themselves
to
be
Jews
;
<EOS>
Buchan
,
the
saddler
,
was
Scotch
;
Pash
,
the
watchmaker
,
was
a
small
,
dark
,
vivacious
,
triple
-
baked
Jew
;
Gideon
,
the
optical
instrument
maker
,
was
a
Jew
of
the
red
-
haired
,
generous
-
featured
type
easily
passing
for
Englishmen
of
unusually
cordial
manners
:
and
Croop
,
the
dark
-
eyed
shoemaker
,
was
probably
more
Celtic
than
he
knew
.
<EOS>
Only
three
would
have
been
discernable
everywhere
as
Englishman
:
the
wood
-
inlayer
Goodwin
,
well
-
built
,
open
-
faced
,
pleasant
-
voiced
;
the
florid
laboratory
assistant
Marrables
;
and
Lily
,
the
pale
,
neat
-
faced
copying
-
clerk
,
<EOS>
whose
light
-
brown
hair
was
set
up
in
a
small
parallelogram
above
his
well
-
filled
forehead
,
and
whose
shirt
,
taken
with
an
otherwise
seedy
costume
,
had
a
freshness
that
might
be
called
insular
,
and
perhaps
even
something
narrower
.
  
<EOS>
Certainly
a
company
select
of
the
select
among
poor
men
,
being
drawn
together
by
a
taste
not
prevalent
even
among
the
privileged
heirs
of
learning
and
its
institutions
;
and
not
likely
to
amuse
any
gentleman
in
search
of
crime
or
low
comedy
as
the
ground
of
interest
in
people
whose
weekly
income
is
only
divisible
into
shillings
.
<EOS>
Deronda
,
even
if
he
had
not
been
more
than
usually
inclined
to
gravity
under
the
influence
of
what
was
pending
between
him
and
Mordecai
,
would
not
have
set
himself
to
find
food
for
laughter
in
the
various
shades
of
departure
from
the
tone
of
polished
society
sure
to
be
observable
in
the
air
and
talk
of
these
men
who
had
probably
snatched
knowledge
as
most
of
us
snatch
indulgences
,
making
the
utmost
of
scant
opportunity
.
<EOS>
He
looked
around
him
with
the
quiet
air
of
respect
habitual
to
him
among
equals
,
ordered
whisky
and
water
,
and
offered
the
contents
of
his
cigar
-
case
,
which
,
characteristically
enough
,
he
always
carried
and
hardly
ever
used
for
his
own
behoof
,
having
reasons
for
not
smoking
himself
,
but
liking
to
indulge
others
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
was
his
weakness
to
be
afraid
of
seeming
straight
-
laced
,
and
turning
himself
into
a
sort
of
diagram
instead
of
a
growth
which
can
exercise
the
guiding
attraction
of
fellowship
.
<EOS>
That
he
made
a
decidedly
winning
impression
on
the
company
was
proved
by
their
showing
themselves
no
less
at
ease
than
before
,
and
desirous
of
quickly
resuming
their
interrupted
talk
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
what
I
call
one
of
our
touch
-
and
-
go
nights
,
sir
,
"
said
Miller
,
who
was
implicitly
accepted
as
a
sort
of
moderator
 
on
addressing
Deronda
by
way
of
explanation
,
and
nodding
toward
each
person
whose
name
he
mentioned
.
<EOS>
"
Sometimes
we
stick
pretty
close
to
the
point
.
<EOS>
But
tonight
our
friend
Pash
,
there
,
brought
up
the
law
of
progress
;
and
we
got
on
statistics
;
then
Lily
,
there
,
saying
we
knew
well
enough
before
counting
that
in
the
same
state
of
society
the
same
sort
of
things
would
happen
,
and
it
was
no
more
wonder
that
quantities
should
remain
the
same
,
than
that
qualities
should
remain
the
same
,
for
in
relation
to
society
numbers
are
qualities
 
<EOS>
the
number
of
drunkards
is
a
quality
in
society
 
<EOS>
the
numbers
are
an
index
to
the
qualities
,
and
give
us
no
instruction
,
only
setting
us
to
consider
the
causes
of
difference
between
different
social
states
 
<EOS>
Lily
saying
this
,
we
went
off
on
the
causes
of
social
change
,
and
when
you
came
in
I
was
going
upon
the
power
of
ideas
,
which
I
hold
to
be
the
main
transforming
cause
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
do
n't
hold
with
you
there
,
Miller
,
"
said
Goodwin
,
the
inlayer
,
more
concerned
to
carry
on
the
subject
than
to
wait
for
a
word
from
the
new
guest
.
<EOS>
"
For
either
you
mean
so
many
sorts
of
things
by
ideas
that
I
get
no
knowledge
by
what
you
say
,
any
more
than
if
you
said
light
was
a
cause
;
or
else
you
mean
a
particular
sort
of
ideas
,
and
then
I
go
against
your
meaning
as
too
narrow
.
<EOS>
For
,
look
at
it
in
one
way
,
all
actions
men
put
a
bit
of
thought
into
<EOS>
are
ideas
 
<EOS>
say
,
sowing
seed
,
or
making
a
canoe
,
or
baking
clay
;
and
such
ideas
as
these
work
themselves
into
life
and
go
on
growing
with
it
,
but
they
ca
n't
go
apart
from
the
material
that
set
them
to
work
and
makes
a
medium
for
them
.
<EOS>
It
's
the
nature
of
wood
and
stone
yielding
to
the
knife
that
raises
the
idea
of
shaping
them
,
and
with
plenty
of
wood
and
stone
the
shaping
will
go
on
.
<EOS>
I
look
at
it
,
that
such
ideas
as
are
mixed
straight
away
with
all
the
other
elements
of
life
are
powerful
along
with
'em
.
<EOS>
The
slower
the
mixing
,
the
less
power
they
have
.
<EOS>
And
as
to
the
causes
of
social
change
,
I
look
at
it
in
this
way
 
<EOS>
ideas
are
a
sort
of
parliament
,
but
there
's
a
commonwealth
outside
and
a
good
deal
of
the
commonwealth
is
working
at
change
without
knowing
what
the
parliament
is
doing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
you
take
ready
mixing
as
your
test
of
power
,
"
said
Pash
,
"
some
of
the
least
practical
ideas
beat
everything
.
<EOS>
They
spread
without
being
understood
,
and
enter
into
the
language
without
being
thought
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
may
act
by
changing
the
distribution
of
gases
,
"
said
Marrables
;
"
instruments
are
getting
so
fine
now
,
men
may
come
to
register
the
spread
of
a
theory
by
observed
changes
in
the
atmosphere
and
corresponding
changes
in
the
nerves
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Pash
,
his
dark
face
lighting
up
rather
impishly
,
"
there
is
the
idea
of
nationalities
<EOS>
;
I
dare
say
the
wild
asses
are
snuffing
it
,
and
getting
more
gregarious
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
share
that
idea
?
"
said
Deronda
,
finding
a
piquant
incongruity
between
Pash
's
sarcasm
and
the
strong
stamp
of
race
on
his
features
.
  
<EOS>
"
Say
,
rather
<EOS>
,
he
does
not
share
that
spirit
,
"
said
Mordecai
,
who
had
turned
a
melancholy
glance
on
Pash
.
<EOS>
"
Unless
nationality
is
a
feeling
,
what
force
can
it
have
as
an
idea
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Granted
,
Mordecai
,
"
said
Pash
,
quite
good
-
humoredly
.
"
<EOS>
And
as
the
feeling
of
nationality
is
dying
,
I
take
the
idea
to
be
no
better
than
a
ghost
,
already
walking
to
announce
the
death
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
sentiment
may
seem
to
be
dying
and
yet
revive
into
strong
life
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
Nations
have
revived
.
<EOS>
We
may
live
to
see
a
great
outburst
of
force
in
the
Arabs
,
who
are
being
inspired
with
a
new
zeal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Amen
,
amen
,
"
said
Mordecai
,
looking
at
Deronda
with
a
delight
which
was
the
beginning
of
recovered
energy
<EOS>
:
his
attitude
was
more
upright
,
his
face
was
less
worn
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
may
hold
with
backward
nations
,
"
said
Pash
,
"
<EOS>
but
with
us
in
Europe
the
sentiment
of
nationality
is
destined
to
die
out
.
<EOS>
It
will
last
a
little
longer
in
the
quarters
where
oppression
lasts
,
but
nowhere
else
.
<EOS>
The
whole
current
of
progress
is
setting
against
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
"
said
Buchan
,
in
a
rapid
thin
Scotch
tone
which
was
like
the
letting
in
of
a
little
cool
air
on
the
conversation
,
"
ye've
done
well
to
bring
us
round
to
the
point
.
<EOS>
Ye're
all
agreed
that
societies
change
 
not
always
and
everywhere
 
but
on
the
whole
and
in
the
long
run
.
<EOS>
Now
,
with
all
deference
,
I
would
beg
t
'
observe
that
we
have
got
to
examine
the
nature
of
changes
before
we
have
a
warrant
to
call
them
progress
,
which
word
is
supposed
to
include
a
bettering
,
though
I
apprehend
it
to
be
ill
-
chosen
for
that
purpose
,
since
mere
motion
onward
may
carry
us
to
a
bog
or
a
precipice
.
<EOS>
And
the
questions
I
would
put
are
three
:
<EOS>
Is
all
change
in
the
direction
of
progress
?
<EOS>
if
not
,
how
shall
we
discern
which
change
is
progress
and
<EOS>
which
not
?
<EOS>
and
thirdly
,
how
far
and
in
what
way
can
we
act
upon
the
course
of
change
so
as
to
promote
it
where
it
is
beneficial
,
and
divert
it
where
it
is
injurious
?
"
  
<EOS>
But
Buchan
's
attempt
to
impose
his
method
on
the
talk
was
a
failure
.
<EOS>
Lily
immediately
said
    
"
Change
and
progress
are
merged
in
the
idea
of
development
.
<EOS>
The
laws
of
development
are
being
discovered
,
and
changes
taking
place
according
to
them
are
necessarily
progressive
;
that
is
to
say
,
it
we
have
any
notion
of
progress
or
improvement
opposed
to
them
,
the
notion
is
a
mistake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
really
ca
n't
see
how
you
arrive
at
that
sort
of
certitude
about
changes
by
calling
them
development
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
There
will
still
remain
the
degrees
of
inevitableness
in
relation
to
our
own
will
and
acts
,
and
the
degrees
of
wisdom
in
hastening
or
retarding
;
there
will
still
remain
the
danger
of
mistaking
a
tendency
which
should
be
resisted
for
an
inevitable
law
that
we
must
adjust
ourselves
to
,
 
which
seems
to
me
as
bad
a
superstition
or
false
god
as
any
that
has
been
set
up
without
the
ceremonies
of
philosophising
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
a
truth
,
"
said
Mordecai
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Woe
to
the
men
who
see
no
place
for
resistance
in
this
generation
!
<EOS>
I
believe
in
a
growth
,
a
passage
,
and
a
new
unfolding
of
life
whereof
the
seed
is
more
perfect
,
more
charged
with
the
elements
that
are
pregnant
with
diviner
form
.
<EOS>
The
life
of
a
people
grows
,
it
is
knit
together
and
yet
expanded
,
in
joy
and
sorrow
,
in
thought
and
action
;
it
absorbs
the
thought
of
other
nations
into
its
own
forms
,
and
gives
back
the
thought
as
new
wealth
to
the
world
;
it
is
a
power
and
an
organ
in
the
great
body
of
the
nations
.
<EOS>
But
there
may
come
a
check
,
an
arrest
;
memories
may
be
stifled
,
and
love
may
be
faint
for
the
lack
of
them
;
or
memories
may
shrink
into
withered
relics
 
the
soul
of
a
people
,
whereby
they
know
themselves
to
be
one
,
may
seem
to
be
dying
for
want
of
common
action
.
<EOS>
But
who
shall
say
,
"
The
fountain
of
their
life
is
dried
up
,
they
shall
forever
cease
to
be
a
nation
?
<EOS>
"
Who
shall
say
it
?
<EOS>
Not
he
who
feels
the
life
of
his
people
stirring
within
his
own
.
<EOS>
Shall
he
say
,
"
That
way
events
are
wending
,
I
will
not
resist
?
"
<EOS>
His
very
soul
is
resistance
,
and
is
as
a
seed
of
fire
that
may
enkindle
the
souls
of
multitudes
,
and
make
a
new
pathway
for
events
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
deny
patriotism
,
"
said
Gideon
,
"
but
we
all
know
you
have
a
particular
meaning
,
Mordecai
.
<EOS>
You
know
Mordecai
's
way
of
thinking
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
Here
Gideon
had
turned
to
Deronda
,
who
sat
next
to
him
,
but
without
waiting
for
an
answer
he
went
on
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
rational
Jew
myself
.
<EOS>
I
stand
by
my
people
as
a
sort
of
family
relations
,
and
I
am
for
keeping
up
our
worship
in
a
rational
way
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
approve
of
our
people
getting
baptised
,
because
I
do
n't
believe
in
a
Jew
's
conversion
to
the
Gentile
part
of
Christianity
.
<EOS>
And
now
we
have
political
equality
,
there
's
no
excuse
for
a
pretense
of
that
sort
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
for
getting
rid
of
all
of
our
superstitions
and
exclusiveness
.
<EOS>
There
's
no
reason
now
why
we
should
n't
melt
gradually
into
the
populations
we
live
among
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
order
of
the
day
in
point
of
progress
.
<EOS>
I
would
as
soon
my
children
married
Christians
as
Jews
.
<EOS>
And
I
'm
for
the
old
maxim
,
"
A
man
's
country
is
where
he
's
well
off
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
That
country
's
not
so
easy
to
find
,
Gideon
,
"
said
the
rapid
Pash
,
with
a
shrug
and
grimace
.
<EOS>
"
You
get
ten
shillings
a

week
more
than
I
do

and
have
only
half
the
number

<EOS>
If
somebody
will
introduce
a
brisk
trade
in
watches
among
the
"
Jerusalem
wares
,
"
I
'll
go
 
eh
,
Mordecai
,
what
do
you
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
Deronda
,
all
ear
for
these
hints
of
Mordecai
's
opinion
,
was
inwardly
wondering
at
his
persistence
in
coming
to
this
club
.
<EOS>
For
an
enthusiastic
spirit
to
meet
continually
the
fixed
indifference
of
men
familiar
with
the
object
of
his
enthusiasm
is
the
acceptance
of
a
slow
martyrdom
,
beside
which
the
fate
of
a
missionary
tomahawked
without
any
considerate
rejection
of
his
doctrines
seems
hardly
worthy
of
compassion
.
<EOS>
But
Mordecai
gave
no
sign
of
shrinking
:
this
was
a
moment
of
spiritual
fullness
,
and
he
cared
more
for
the
utterance
of
his
faith
than
for
its
immediate
reception
.
<EOS>
With
a
fervor
which
had
no
temper
in
it
,
but
seemed
rather
the
rush
of
feeling
in
the
opportunity
of
speech
,
he
answered
Pash
:
    
<EOS>
"
What
I
say
is
,
let
every
man
keep
far
away
from
the
brotherhood
and
inheritance
<EOS>
he
despises
.
<EOS>
Thousands
on
thousands
of
our
race
have
mixed
with
the
Gentiles
as
Celt
with
Saxon
,
and
they
may
inherit
the
blessing
that
belongs
to
the
Gentile
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
follow
them
.
<EOS>
You
are
one
of
the
multitudes
over
this
globe
who
must
walk
among
the
nations
and
be
known
as
Jews
,
and
with
words
on
their
lips
which
mean
,
"
I
wish
I
had
not
been
born
a
Jew
<EOS>
,
I
disown
any
bond
with
the
long
travail
of
my
race
,
I
will
outdo
the
Gentile
in
mocking
at
our
separateness
,
"
they
all
the
while
feel
breathing
on
them
the
breath
of
contempt
because
they
are
Jews
,
and
they
will
breathe
it
back
poisonously
.
<EOS>
Can
a
fresh
-
made
garment
of
citizenship
weave
itself
straightway
into
the
flesh
and
change
the
slow
deposit
of
eighteen
centuries
?
<EOS>
What
is
the
citizenship
of
him
who
walks
among
a
people
he
has
no
hardy
kindred
and
fellowship
with
,
and
has
lost
the
sense
of
brotherhood
with
his
own
race
?
<EOS>
It
is
a
charter
of
selfish
ambition
and
rivalry
in
low
greed
.
<EOS>
He
is
an
alien
of
spirit
,
whatever
he
may
be
in
form
;
he
sucks
the
blood
of
mankind
,
he
is
not
a
man
,
sharing
in
no
loves
,
sharing
in
no
subjection
of
the
soul
,
he
mocks
it
all
.
<EOS>
Is
it
not
truth
I
speak
,
Pash
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
exactly
,
Mordecai
,
"
said
Pash
,
"
if
you
mean
that
I
think
the
worse
of
myself
for
being
a
Jew
.
<EOS>
What
I
thank
our
fathers
for
is
that
there
are
fewer
blockheads
among
us
than
among
other
races
.
<EOS>
But
perhaps
you
are
right
in
thinking
the
Christians
do
n't
like
me
so
well
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Catholics
and
Protestants
have
not
liked
each
other
much
better

"
said
the
genial
Gideon
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
wait
patiently
for
prejudices
to
die
out
.
<EOS>
Many
of
our
people
are
on
a
footing
with
the
best
,
and
there
's
been
a
good
filtering
of
our
blood
into
high
families
.
<EOS>
I
am
for
making
our
expectations
rational
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
so
am
I
!
"
<EOS>
said
Mordecai
,
quickly
,
leaning
forward
with
the
eagerness
of
one
who
pleads
in
some
decisive
crisis
,
his
long
,
thin
hands
clasped
together
on
his
lap
.
<EOS>
"
I
,
too
,
claim
to
be
a
rational
Jew
.
<EOS>
But
what
is
it
to
be
rational
 
<EOS>
what
is
it
to
feel
the
light
of
the
divine
reason
growing
stronger
within
and
without
?
<EOS>
It
is
to
see
more
and
more
of
the
hidden
bonds
that
bind
and
consecrate
change
as
a
dependent
growth
 
yea
,
consecrate
it
with
kinship
<EOS>
:
the
past
becomes
my
parent
and
the
future
stretches
toward
me
the
appealing
arms
of
children
.
<EOS>
Is
it
rational
to
drain
away
the
sap
of
special
kindred
that
makes
the
families
of
men
rich
in
interchanged
wealth
,
and
various
as
the
forests
are
various
with
the
glory
of
the
cedar
and
the
palm
?
<EOS>
When
it
is
rational
to
say
,
"
I
know
not
my
father
or
my
mother
,
let
my
children
be
aliens
to
me
,
that
no
prayer
of
mine
may
touch
them
,
"
then
it
will
be
rational
for
the
Jew
to
say
,
'
I
will
seek
to
know
no
difference
between
me
and
the
Gentile
,
I
will
not
cherish
the
prophetic
consciousness
of
our
nationality
 
<EOS>
let
the
Hebrew
cease
to
be
,
and
let
all
his
memorials
be
antiquarian
trifles
,
dead
as
the
wall
-
paintings
of
a
conjectured
race
.
<EOS>
Yet
let
his
child
learn
by
rote
the
speech
of
the
Greek
,
where
he
abjures
his
fellow
-
citizens
by
the
bravery
of
those
who
fought
foremost
at
Marathon
 
<EOS>
let
him
learn
to
say
that
was
noble
in
the
Greek
,
that
is
the
spirit
of
an
immortal
nation
!
<EOS>
But
the
Jew
has
no
memories
that
bind
him
to
action
;
let
him
laugh
that
his
nation
is
degraded
from
a
nation
;
let
him
hold
the
monuments
of
his
law
which
carried
within
its
frame
the
breath
of
social
justice
,
of
charity
,
and
of
household
sanctities
 
<EOS>
let
him
hold
the
energy
of
the
prophets
,
the
patient
care
of
the
Masters
,
the
fortitude
of
martyred
generations
,
as
mere
stuff
for
a
professorship
.
<EOS>
The
business
of
the
Jew
in
all
things
is
to
be
even
as
the
rich
Gentile

<EOS>
Mordecai
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
,
and
there
was
a
moment
's
silence
.
<EOS>
Not
one
member
of
the
club
shared
his
point
of
view
or
his
emotion
;
but
his
whole
personality
and
speech
had
on
them
the
effect
of
a
dramatic
representation
which
had
some
pathos
in
it
,
though
no
practical
consequences
;
and
usually
he
was
at
once
indulged
and
contradicted
.
<EOS>
Deronda
's
mind
went
back
upon
what
must
have
been
the
tragic
pressure
of
outward
conditions
hindering
this
man
,
whose
force
he
felt
to
be
telling
on
himself
,
from
making
any
world
for
his
thought
in
the
minds
of
others
 
like
a
poet
among
people
of
a
strange
speech
,
who
may
have
a
poetry
of
their
own
,
but
have
no
ear
for
his
cadence
,
no
answering
thrill
to
his
discovery
of
the
latent
virtues
in
his
mother
tongue
.
  
<EOS>
The
cool
Buchan
was
the
first
to
speak
,
and
hint
the
loss
of
time
.
<EOS>
"
I
submit
,
"
said
he
,
"
that
ye're
traveling
away
from
the
questions
I
put
concerning
progress
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Say
they
're
levanting
,
Buchan
,

said
Miller
,
who
liked
his
joke
,
and
would
not
have
objected
to
be
called
Voltairian
.
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
.
<EOS>
Let
us
have
a
Jewish
night
;
we
've
not
had
one
for
a
long
while
.
<EOS>
Let
us
take
the
discussion
on
Jewish
ground
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
we
've
no
prejudice
here
;
we
're
all
philosophers
;
and
we
like
our
friends
Mordecai
,
Pash
,
and
Gideon
,
as
well
as
if
they
were
no
more
kin
to
Abraham
than
the
rest
of
us
.
<EOS>
We
're
all
related
through
Adam
,
until
further
showing
to
the
contrary
,
and
if
you
look
into
history
we
've
all
got
some
discreditable
forefathers
.
<EOS>
So
I
mean
no
offence
when
I
say
I
do
n't
think
any
great
things
of
the
part
the
Jewish
people
have
played
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
What
then
?
<EOS>
I
think
they
were
iniquitously
dealt
by
in
past
times
.
<EOS>
And
I
suppose
we
do
n't
want
any
men
to
be
maltreated
,
white
,
black
,
brown
,
or
yellow
 
<EOS>
I
know
<EOS>
I
've
just
given
my
half
-
crown
to
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
And
that
reminds
me
,
I
've
a
curious
old
German
book
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
read
it
myself
,
but
a
friend
of
mine
was
reading
out
of
it
to
me
the
other
day
 
about
the
prejudicies
against
the
Jews
,
and
the
stories
used
to
be
told
against
'em
,
and
<EOS>
what
do
you
think
one
was
?
<EOS>
Why
,
that
they
're
punished
with
a
bad
odor
in
their
bodies
;
and
_
that
_
,
says
the
author
,
date
1715
<EOS>
(
I
've
just
been
pricing
and
marking
the
book
this
very
morning
)
 
<EOS>
that
is
true
,
for
the
ancients
spoke
of
it
.
<EOS>
But
then
,
he
says
,
the
other
things
are
fables
,
such
as
that
the
odor
goes
away
all
at
once
when
they
're
baptized
,
and
that
every
one
of
the
ten
tribes
,
mind
you
,
all
the
ten
being
concerned
in
the
crucifixion
,
has
got
a
particular
punishment
over
and
above
the
smell
:
 
<EOS>
Asher
<EOS>
,
I
remember
,
has
the
right
arm
a
handbreadth
shorter
than
the
left
,
and
Naphthali
has
pig
's
ears
and
a
smell
of
live
pork
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
of
that
?
<EOS>
There
's
been
a
good
deal
of
fun
made
of
rabbinical
fables
,
but
in
point
of
fables
my
opinion
is
,
that
all
over
the
world
it
's
six
of
one
and
half
-
a
-
dozen
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
However
,
as
I
said
before
,
I
hold
with
the
philosophers
of
the
last
century
that
the
Jews
have
played
no
great
part
as
a
people
,
though
Pash
will
have
it
<EOS>
they
're
clever
enough
to
beat
all
the
rest
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
But
if
so
,
I
ask
,
why
have
n't
they
done
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
the
same
reason
that
the
cleverest
men
in
the
country
do
n't
get
themselves
or
their
ideas
into
Parliament
,
"
said
the
ready
Pash
;
"
because
the
blockheads
are
too
many
for
'
em
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
a
vain
question
,
"
said
Mordecai
,
"
whether
our
people
would
beat
the
rest
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
Each
nation
has
its
own
work
,
and
is
a
member
of
the
world
,
enriched
by
the
work
of
each
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
true
,
as
Jehuda
-
ha
-
Levi
first
said
,
that
Israel
is
the
heart
of
mankind
,
if
we
mean
by
heart
the
core
of
affection
which
binds
a
race
and
its
families
in
dutiful
love
,
and
the
reverence
for
the
human
body
which
lifts
the
needs
of

the
tenderness

is
merciful
to

the

They
're
not
behind
any
nation
in
arrogance

said
Lily
;
"
and
if
they
have
got
in

rear

it
has
not
been

over

Oh

brags
in

Miller

Yes

Pash

some
of
them
in

Hebrew
text

<EOS>
"
Well
,
whatever
the

contributed
at
one

they
are
a

Lily

<EOS>
"
They

the

obstinate
adherence
to
the
superannuated

<EOS>
They
may
show
good
abilities
when
they
take
up
liberal
ideas
,
but
as
a
race
they
have
no
development
in
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
false
!
"
<EOS>
said
Mordecai
,
leaning
forward
again
with
his
former
eagerness
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Let
their
history
be
known
and
examined
;
let
the
seed
be
sifted
,
let
its
beginning
be
traced
to
the
weed
of
the
wilderness
 
the
more
glorious
will
be
the
energy
that
transformed
it
.
<EOS>
Where
else
is
there
a
nation
of
whom
it
may
be
as
truly
said
that
their
religion
and
law
and
moral
life
mingled
as
the
stream
of
blood
in
the
heart
and
made
one
growth
 
where
else
a
people
who
kept
and
enlarged
their
spiritual
store
at
the
very
time
when
they
are
hated
with
a
hatred
as
fierce
as
the
forest
fires
that
chase
the
wild
beast
from
his
covert
?
<EOS>
There
is
a
fable
of
the
Roman
,
that
swimming
to
save
his
life
<EOS>
he
held
the
roll
of
his
writings
between
his
teeth
and
saved
them
from
the
waters
.
<EOS>
But
how
much
more
than
that
is
true
of
our
race
?
<EOS>
They
struggled
to
keep
their
place
among
the
nations
like
heroes
 
<EOS>
yea
,
when
the
hand
was
hacked
off
,
they
clung
with
their
teeth
;
but
when
the
plow
and
the
harrow
had
passed
over
the
last
visible
signs
of
their
national
covenant
,
and
the
fruitfulness
of
their
land
was
stifled
with
the
blood
of
the
sowers
and
planters
,
they
said
,
"
The
spirit
is
alive
,
let
us
make
it
a
lasting
habitation
 
<EOS>
lasting
because
movable
 
so
that
it
may
be
carried
from
generation
to
generation
,
and
our
sons
unborn
may
be
rich
in
the
things
that
have
been
,
and
possess
a
hope
built
on
an
unchangeable
foundation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
They
said
it
<EOS>
and
they
wrought
it
,
though
often
breathing
with
scant
life
,
as
in
a
coffin
,
or
as
lying
wounded
amid
a
heap
of
slain
.
<EOS>
Hooted
and
scared
like
the
unknown
dog
,
the
Hebrew
made
himself
envied
for
his
wealth
and
wisdom
,
and
was
bled
of
them
to
fill
the
bath
of
Gentile
luxury
;
he
absorbed
knowledge
,
he
diffused
it
;
his
dispersed
race
was
a
new
Phoenicia
working
the
mines
of
Greece
and
carrying
their
products
to
the
world
.
<EOS>
The
native
spirit
of
our
tradition
was
not
to
stand
still
,
but
to
use
records
as
a
seed
and
draw
out
the
compressed
virtues
of
law
and
prophecy
;
and
while
the
Gentile
,
who
had
said
,
"
What
is
yours
is
ours
,
and
no
longer
yours
,
"
was
reading
the
letter
of
our
law
as
a
dark
inscription
,
or
was
turning
its
parchments
into
shoe
-
soles
for
an
army
rabid
with
lust
and
cruelty
,
our
Masters
were
still
enlarging
and
illuminating
with
fresh
-
fed
interpretation
.
<EOS>
But
the
dispersion
was
wide
,
the
yoke
of
oppression
was
a
spiked
torture
as
well
as
a
load
;
the
exile
was
forced
afar
among
brutish
people
,
where
the
consciousness
of
his
race
was
no
clearer
to
him
than
the
light
of
the
sun
to
our
fathers
in
the
Roman
persecution
,
who
had
their
hiding
-
place
in
a
cave
,
and
knew
not
that
it
was
day
save
by
the
dimmer
burning
of
their
candles
.
<EOS>
What
wonder
that
multitudes
of
our
people
are
ignorant
,
narrow
,
superstitious
?
<EOS>
What
wonder
?
"
  
<EOS>
Here
Mordecai
,
whose
seat
was
next
the
fireplace
,
rose
and
leaned
his
arm
on
the
little
shelf
;
his
excitement
had
risen
,
though
his
voice
,
which
had
begun
with
unusual
strength
,
was
getting
hoarser
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
wonder
?
<EOS>
The
night
is
unto
them
,
that
they
have
no
vision
;
in
their
darkness
they
are
unable
to
divine
;
the
sun
is
gone
down
over
the
prophets
,
and
the
day
is
dark
above
them
;
their
observances
are
as
nameless
relics
.
<EOS>
But
which
among
the
chief
of
the
Gentile
nations
has
not
an
ignorant
multitude
?
<EOS>
They
scorn
our
people
's
ignorant
observance
;
but
the
most
accursed
ignorance
is
that
which
has
no
observance
 
sunk
to
the
cunning
greed
of
the
fox
,
to
which
all
law
is
no
more
than
a
trap
or
the
cry
of
the
worrying
hound
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
degradation
deep
down
below
the
memory
that
has
withered
into
superstition
.
<EOS>
In
the
multitudes
of
the
ignorant
on
three
continents
who
observe
our
rites
and
make
the
confession
of
the
divine
Unity
,
the
soul
of
Judaism
is
not
dead
.
<EOS>
Revive
the
organic
centre
:
let
the
unity
of
Israel
which
has
made
the
growth
and
form
of
its
religion
be
an
outward
reality
.
<EOS>
Looking
toward
a
land
and
a
polity
,
our
dispersed
people
in
all
the
ends
of
the
earth
may
share
the
dignity
of
a
national
life
which
has
a
voice
among
the
peoples
of
the
East
and
the
West
 
<EOS>
which
will
plant
the
wisdom
and
skill
of
our
race
so
that
it
may
be
,
as
of
old
,
a
medium
of
transmission
and
understanding
.
<EOS>
Let
that
come
to
pass
,
and
the
living
warmth
will
spread
to
the
weak
extremities
of
Israel
,
and
superstition
will
vanish
,
not
in
the
lawlessness
of
the
renegade
,
but
in
the
illumination
of
great
facts
which
widen
feeling
,
and
make
all
knowledge
alive
as
the
young
offspring
of
beloved
memories

<EOS>
Mordecai
's
voice
had
sunk
,
but
with
the
hectic
brilliancy
of
his
gaze
<EOS>
it
was
not
the
less
impressive
.
<EOS>
His
extraordinary
excitement
was
certainly
due
to
Deronda
's
presence
:
it
was
to
Deronda
that
he
was
speaking
,
and
the
moment
had
a
testamentary
solemnity
for
him
which
rallied
all
his
powers
.
<EOS>
Yet
the
presence
of
those
other
familiar
men
promoted
expression
,
for
they
embodied
the
indifference
which
gave
a
resistant
energy
to
his
speech
.
<EOS>
Not
that
he
looked
at
Deronda
:
he
seemed
to
see
nothing
immediately
around
him
,
and
if
any
one
had
grasped
him
he
would
probably
not
have
known
it
.
<EOS>
Again
the
former
words
came
back
to
Deronda
's
mind
,
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
hope
my
hopes
 
see
the
vision
I
point
to
 
behold
a
glory
where
I
behold
it
.
<EOS>
"
They
came
now
with
gathered
pathos
.
<EOS>
Before
him
stood
,
as
a
living
,
suffering
reality
,
what
hitherto
he
had
only
seen
as
an
effort
of
imagination
,
which
,
in
its
comparative
faintness
,
yet
carried
a
suspicion
,
of
being
exaggerated
:
a
man
steeped
in
poverty
and
obscurity
,
weakened
by
disease
,
consciously
within
the
shadow
of
advancing
death
,
but
living
an
intense
life
in
an
invisible
past
and
future
,
careless
of
his
personal
lot
,
except
for
its
possible
making
some
obstruction
to
a
conceived
good
which
he
would
never
share
except
as
a
brief
inward
vision
 
a
day
afar
off
,
whose
sun
would
never
warm
him
,
but
into
which
he
threw
his
soul
's
desire
,
with
a
passion
often
wanting
to
the
personal
motives
of
healthy
youth
.
<EOS>
It
was
something
more
than
a
grandiose
transfiguration
of
the
parental
love
that
toils
,
renounces
,
endures
,
resists
the
suicidal
promptings
of
despair
 
all
because
of
the
little
ones
,
whose
future
becomes
present
to
the
yearning
gaze
of
anxiety
.
  
<EOS>
All
eyes
were
fixed
on
Mordecai
as
he
sat
down
again
,
and
none
with
unkindness
;
but
it
happened
that
the
one
who
felt
the
most
kindly
was
the
most
prompted
to
speak
in
opposition
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
genial
and
rational
Gideon
,
who
also
was
not
without
a
sense
that
he
was
addressing
the
guest
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
He
said
    
"
You
have
your
own
way
of
looking
at
things
,
Mordecai
,
and
as
you
say
,
your
own
way
seems
to
you
rational
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
do
n't
hold
with
the
restoration
of
Judea
by
miracle
,
and
so
on
;
but
you
are
as
well
aware
as
I
am
that
the
subject
has
been
mixed
with
a
heap
of
nonsense
both
by
Jews
and
Christians
.
<EOS>
And
as
to
the
connection
of
our
race
with
Palestine
,
it
has
been
perverted
by
superstition
till
it
's
as
demoralizing
as
the
old
poor
-
law
.
<EOS>
The
raff
and
scum
go
there
to
be
maintained
like
able
-
bodied
paupers
,
and
to
be
taken
special
care
of
by
the
angel
Gabriel
when
they
die
.
<EOS>
It
's
no
use
fighting
against
facts
.
<EOS>
We
must
look
where
they
point
;
that
's
what
I
call
rationality
.
<EOS>
The
most
learned
and
liberal
men
among
us
who
are
attached
to
our
religion
are
for
clearing
our
liturgy
of
all
such
notions
as
a
literal
fulfillment
of
the
prophecies
about
restoration
,
and
so
on
.
<EOS>
Prune
it
of
a
few
useless
rites
and
literal
interpretations
of
that
sort
,
and
our
religion
is
the
simplest
of
all
religions
,
and
makes
no
barrier
,
but
a
union
,
between
us
and
the
rest
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
plain
as
a
pike
-
staff
,
"
said
Pash
,
with
an
ironical
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
You
pluck
it
up
by
the
roots
,
strip
off
the
leaves
and
bark
,
shave
off
the
knots
,
and
smooth
it
at
top
and
bottom
;
put
it
where
you
will
,
it
will
do
no
harm
,
it
will
never
sprout
.
<EOS>
You
may
make
a
handle
of
it
,
or
you
may
throw
it
on
the
bonfire
of
scoured
rubbish
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
see
why
our
rubbish
is
to
be
held
sacred
any
more
than
the
rubbish
of
Brahmanism
or
Buddhism
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mordecai
,
"
no
,
Pash
,
because
you
have
lost
the
heart
of
the
Jew

<EOS>
Community
was
felt
before
it
was
called
good

<EOS>
I
praise
no
superstition
,
I
praise
the
living
fountains
of
enlarging
belief
.
<EOS>
What
is
growth
,
completion
,
development
?
<EOS>
You
began
with
that
question
,
I
apply
it
to
the
history
of
our
people
.
<EOS>
I
say
that
the
effect
of
our
separateness
will
not
be
completed
and
have
its
highest
transformation
unless
our
race
takes
on
again
the
character
of
a
nationality
.
<EOS>
That
is
the
fulfillment
of
the
religious
trust
that
moulded
them
into
a
people
,
whose
life
has
made
half
the
inspiration
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
What
is
it
to
me
that
the
ten
tribes
are
lost
untraceably
,
or
that
multitudes
of
the
children
of
Judah
have
mixed
themselves
with
the
Gentile
populations
as
a
river
with
rivers
?
<EOS>
Behold
our
people
still
!
<EOS>
Their
skirts
spread
afar
;
they
are
torn

soiled

trodden
on

there
is
a
jeweled
breastplate

Let

monarchs

commerce
,
the
learned
in
all
knowledge

the
skilful
in
all
arts

the
speakers

the
political
counselors

carry
in
their
veins
the
Hebrew
blood
which
has
maintained
its
vigor
in
all
climates
,
and
the
pliancy
of
the
Hebrew
genius
for
which
difficulty
means
new
device
 
<EOS>
let
them
say
,
"
we
will
lift
up
a
standard
,
we
will
unite
in
a
labor
hard
but
glorious
like
that
of
Moses
and
Ezra
,
a
labor
which
shall
be
a
worthy
fruit
of
the
long
anguish
whereby
our
fathers
maintained
their
separateness
,
refusing
the
ease
of
falsehood
.
<EOS>
"
They
have
wealth
enough
to
redeem
the
soil
from
debauched
and
paupered
conquerors
;
they
have
the
skill
of
the
statesman
to
devise
,
the
tongue
of
the
orator
to
persuade
.
<EOS>
And
is
there
no
prophet
or
poet
among
us
to
make
the
ears
of
Christian
Europe
tingle
with
shame
at
the
hideous
obloquy
of
Christian
strife
which
the
Turk
gazes
at
as
at
the
fighting
of
beasts
to
which
he
has
lent
an
arena
?
<EOS>
There
is
store
of
wisdom
among
us
to
found
a
new
Jewish
polity
,
grand
,
simple
,
just
,
like
the
old
 
a
republic
where
there
is
equality
of
protection
,
an
equality
which
shone
like
a
star
on
the
forehead
of
our
ancient
community
,
and
gave
it
more
than
the
brightness
of
Western
freedom
amid
the
despotisms
of
the
East
.
<EOS>
Then
our
race
shall
have
an
organic
centre
,
a
heart
and
brain
to
watch
and
guide
and
execute
;
the
outraged
Jew
shall
have
a
defense
in
the
court
of
nations
,
as
the
outraged
Englishman
of
America
.
<EOS>
And
the
world
will
gain
as
Israel
gains
.
<EOS>
For
there
will
be
a
community
in
the
van
of
the
East
which
carries
the
culture
and
the
sympathies
of
every
great
nation
in
its
bosom
:
there
will
be
a
land
set
for
a
halting
-
place
of
enmities
,
a
neutral
ground
for
the
East
as
Belgium
is
for
the
West

<EOS>
Difficulties
?
<EOS>
I
know
there
are
difficulties
.
<EOS>
But
let
the
spirit
of
sublime
achievement
move
in
the
great
among
our
people
,
and
the
work
will
begin

"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
we
may
safely
admit
that

"
When

great
men

difficulties

Deronda
,
inclined
by
nature
to
take
the
side
of
those
on
whom
the
arrows
of
scorn
were
falling
,
could
not
help
replying
to
Pash
's
outfling
,
and
said
    
"
If
we
look
back
to
the
history
of
efforts
which
have
made
great
changes
,
it
is
astonishing
how
many
of
them
seemed
hopeless
to
those
who
looked
on
in
the
beginning
.
  
<EOS>
"
Take
what
we
have
all
heard
and
seen
something
of
 
the
effort
after
the
unity
of
Italy
,
which
we
are
sure
soon
to
see
accomplished
to
the
very
last
boundary

<EOS>
Look
into
Mazzini
's
account
of
his
first

Almost
everything
seemed
against
him

indifferent

hostile

incredulous

Of

lay
with
him

As

national
consciousness

I
suppose
nobody
will
deny

be
a

arduous

The
heritage
of
Israel
is
beating
in
the
pulses
of
millions
;
it
lives
in
their
veins
as
a
power
without
understanding
,
like
the
morning
exultation
of
herds
;
it
is
the
inborn
half
of
memory
,
moving
as
in
a
dream
among
writings
on
the
walls
,
which
it
sees
dimly
but
can
not
divide
into
speech

Let
the
torch
of
visible
community
be
lit

<EOS>
Let
the
reason
of
Israel
disclose
itself
in
a
great
outward
deed
,
and
let
there
be
another
great
migration
,
another
choosing
of
Israel
to
be
a
nationality
whose
members
may
still
stretch
to
the
ends
of
the
earth

even
as
the
sons

whom
enterprise
carries
afar

who
still
have
a
national

Baruch
Spinoza
had
not
a
faithful
Jewish
heart
,
though
he
had
sucked
the
life
of
his
intellect
at
the
breasts
of
Jewish
tradition

He
laid
bare
his
father
's
nakedness

said
,
"
They
who
scorn
him

Yet
Baruch
Spinoza
confessed
,
he
saw
not
why
Israel
should
not
again
be
a
chosen
nation

Who
says

living

the
history

Greece

which
have
inspired
revolutions

enkindled
the

tremble

Mordecai
had
stretched
his

upward

Gideon
was
certainly
a
little
moved
,
for
though
there
was
no
long
pause
before
he
made
a
remark
in
objection
,
his
tone
was
more
mild
and
deprecatory
than
before

Pash
,
meanwhile
,
pressing
his
lips
together
,
rubbing
his
black
head
with
both
his
hands
and
wrinkling
his
brow
horizontally
,
with
the
expression
of
one
who
differs
from
every
speaker

but
does
not
think
it
worth
while

so

There
is
a
sort

human
paste

there
's
another
side

It

stiff

rancor
inherited
from

persecution

you
justify
keeping
one

throwing
away
the

ugly

<EOS>

I
justify
the
choice

justified

said
Mordecai

"
I
cherish
nothing

the

The
spirit

is
not
hatred

wrong

are
children

<EOS>
what
wonder

since
there
is
hatred

breasts

Let

be
kindled
again

reach
afar

The
degraded

scorned
of
our

will
learn
to
think
of
their
sacred
land
,
not
as
a
place
for
saintly
beggary
to
await
death
in
loathsome
idleness
,
but
as
a
republic
where
the
Jewish
spirit
manifests
itself
in
a
new
order
founded
on
the
old
,
purified
and
enriched
by
the
experience
our
greatest
sons
have
gathered
from
the
life
of
the
ages

<EOS>
How
long
is
it
?
 
<EOS>
only
two
centuries
since
a
vessel
carried
over
the
ocean
the
beginning
of
the
great
North
American
nation
.
<EOS>
The
people
grew
like
meeting
waters
 
<EOS>
they
were
various
in
habit
and
sect
 
<EOS>
there
came
a
time
,
a
century
ago
,
when
they
needed
a
polity
,
and
there
were
heroes
of
peace
among
them
.
<EOS>
What
had
they
to
form
a
polity
with
but
memories
of
Europe
,
corrected
by
the
vision
of
a
better
?
<EOS>
Let
our
wise
and
wealthy
show
themselves
heroes

<EOS>
They
have
the
memories
of
the
East
and
West
,
and
they
have
the
full
vision
of
a
better

<EOS>
A
new
Persia
with
a
purified
religion
magnified
itself
in
art
and
wisdom

<EOS>
So
will
a
new
Judaea
,
poised
between
East

West
 
a
covenant
of
reconciliation

<EOS>
Will
any
say
,
the
prophetic
vision
of
your
race
has
been
hopelessly
mixed
with
folly
and
bigotry
:
<EOS>
the
angel
of
progress
has
no
message
for
Judaism
 
<EOS>
it
is
a
half
-
buried
city
for
the
paid
workers
to
lay
open
 
<EOS>
the
waters
are
rushing
by
it
as
a
forsaken
field

<EOS>
I
say
that
the
strongest
principle
of
growth
lies
in
human
choice
.
<EOS>
The
sons
of
Judah
have
to
choose
that
God
may
again
choose
them
.
<EOS>
The
Messianic
time
is
the
time
when
Israel
shall
will
the
planting
of
the
national
ensign
.
<EOS>
The
Nile
overflowed
and
rushed
onward
:
the
Egyptian
could
not
choose
the
overflow
,
but
he
chose
to
work
and
make
channels
for
the
fructifying
waters
,
and
Egypt
became
the
land
of
corn
.
<EOS>
Shall
man
,
whose
soul
is
set
in
the
royalty
of
discernment
and
resolve
,
deny
his
rank
and
say
,
I
am
an
onlooker
,
ask
no
choice
or
purpose
of
me
?
<EOS>
That
is
the
blasphemy
of
this
time
.
<EOS>
The
divine
principle
of
our
race
is
action
,
choice
,
resolved
memory
.
<EOS>
Let
us
contradict
the
blasphemy
,
and
help
to
will
our
own
better
future
and
the
better
future
of
the
world
 
not
renounce
our
higher
gift
and
say
,
"
Let
us
be
as

we
were
not
among

"
but
choose
our
full
heritage
,
claim
the
brotherhood
of
our
nation
,
and
carry
into
it
a
new
brotherhood
with
the
nations
of
the
Gentiles
.
<EOS>
The
vision
is
there
;
it
will
be
fulfilled
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
the
last
sentence
,
which
was
no
more
than
a
loud
whisper
,
Mordecai
let
his
chin
sink
on
his
breast
and
his
eyelids
fall
.
<EOS>
No
one
spoke
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
the
first
time
that
he
had
insisted
on
the
same
ideas
,
but
he
was
seen
to
-
night
in
a
new
phase
.
<EOS>
The
quiet
tenacity
of
his
ordinary
self
differed
as
much
from
his
present
exaltation
of
mood
as
a
man
in
private
talk
,
giving
reasons
for
a
revolution
of
which
no
sign
is
discernable
,
differs
from
one
who
feels
himself
an
agent
in
a
revolution
begun
.
<EOS>
The
dawn
of
fulfillment
brought
to
his
hope
by
Deronda
's
presence
<EOS>
had
wrought
Mordecai
's
conception
into
a
state
of
impassioned
conviction
,
and
he
had
found
strength
in
his
excitement
to
pour
forth
the
unlocked
floods
of
emotive
argument
,
with
a
sense
of
haste
as
at
a
crisis
which
must
be
seized
.
<EOS>
But
now
there
had
come
with
the
quiescence
of
fatigue
a
sort
of
thankful
wonder
that
he
had
spoken
 
a
contemplation
of
his
life
as
a
journey
which
had
come
at
last
to
this
bourne
.
<EOS>
After
a
great
excitement
,
the
ebbing
strength
of
impulse
is
apt
to
leave
us
in
this
aloofness
from
our
active
self
.
<EOS>
And
in
the
moments
after
Mordecai
had
sunk
his
head
,
his
mind
was
wandering
along
the
paths
of
his
youth
,
and
all
the
hopes
which
had
ended
in
bringing
him
hither
.
  
<EOS>
Every
one
felt
that
the
talk
was
ended
,
and
the
tone
of
phlegmatic
discussion
made
unseasonable
by
Mordecai
's
high
-
pitched
solemnity
.
<EOS>
It
was
as
if
they
had
come
together
to
hear
the
blowing
of
the
_
shophar
_
,
and
had
nothing
to
do
now
but
to
disperse
.
<EOS>
The
movement
was
unusually
general
,
and
in
less
than
ten
minutes
the
room
was
empty
of
all
except
Mordecai
and
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
-
nights
"
had
been
given
to
Mordecai
,
but
it
was
evident
he
had
not
heard
them
,
for
he
remained
rapt
and
motionless
.
<EOS>
Deronda
would
not
disturb
this
needful
rest
,
but
waited
for
a
spontaneous
movement
.
      
<EOS>
"
My
spirit
is
too
weak
;
mortality
  
Weighs
heavily
on
me
like
unwilling
sleep
,
  
<EOS>
And
each
imagined
pinnacle
and
steep
  
<EOS>
Of
godlike
hardship
tells
me
I
must
die
  
Like
a
sick
eagle
looking
at
the
sky

KEATS

<EOS>
After
a
few
minutes
the
unwonted
stillness
had
penetrated
Mordecai
's
consciousness
,
and
he
looked
up
at
Deronda
,
not
in
the
least
with
bewilderment
and
surprise
,
but
with
a
gaze
full
of
reposing
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
Deronda
rose
and
placed
his
chair
nearer
,
where
there
could
be
no
imagined
need
for
raising
the
voice
.
<EOS>
Mordecai
felt
the
action
as
a
patient
feels
the
gentleness
that
eases
his
pillow
.
<EOS>
He
began
to
speak
in
a
low
tone
,
as
if
he
were
only
thinking
articulately
,
not
trying
to
reach
an
audience
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
doctrine
of
the
Cabbala
,
souls
are
born
again
and
again
in
new
bodies
till
they
are
perfected
and
purified
,
and
a
soul
liberated
from
a
worn
-
out
body
may
join
the
fellow
-
soul
that
needs
it
,
that
they
may
be
perfected
together
,
and
their
earthly
work
accomplished
.
<EOS>
Then
they
will
depart
from
the
mortal
region
,
and
leave
place
for
new
souls
to
be
born
out
of
the
store
in
the
eternal
bosom
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
lingering
imperfection
of
the
souls
already
born
into
the
mortal
region
that
hinders
the
birth
of
new
souls
and
the
preparation
of
the
Messianic
time
:
 
thus
the
mind
has
given
shape
to
what
is
hidden
,
as
the
shadow
of
what
is
known
,
and
has
spoken
truth
,
though
it
were
only
in
parable
.
<EOS>
When
my
long
-
wandering
soul
is
liberated
from
this
weary
body
,
it
will
join
yours
,
and
its
work
will
be
perfected
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mordecai
's
pause
seemed
an
appeal
which
Deronda
's
feeling
would
not
let
him
leave
unanswered
.
<EOS>
He
tried
to
make
it
truthful
;
but
for
Mordecai
's
ear
it
was
inevitably
filled
with
unspoken
meaning
.
<EOS>
He
only
said
    
"
Everything
I
can
in
conscience
do
to
make
your
life
effective
<EOS>
I
will
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
,
"
said
Mordecai
,
in
a
tone
of
quiet
certainty
which
dispenses
with
further
assurance
.
<EOS>
"
I
heard
it
.
<EOS>
You
see
it
all
 
<EOS>
you
are
by
my
side
on
the
mount
of
vision
,
and
behold
the
paths
of
fulfillment
which
others
deny
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
silent
a
moment
or
two
,
and
then
went
on
meditatively
    
<EOS>
"
You
will
take
up
my
life
where
it
was
broken
.
<EOS>
I
feel
myself
back
in
that
day
when
my
life
was
broken
.
<EOS>
The
bright
morning
sun
was
on
the
quay
 
<EOS>
it
was
at
Trieste
 
<EOS>
the
garments
of
men
from
all
nations
shone
like
jewels
 
<EOS>
the
boats
were
pushing
off
 
the
Greek
vessel
that
would
land
us
at
Beyrout
was
to
start
in
an
hour
.
<EOS>
I
was
going
with
a
merchant
as
his
clerk
and
companion
.
<EOS>
I
said
,
I
shall
behold
the
lands
and
people
of
the
East
,
and
I
shall
speak
with
a
fuller
vision
.
<EOS>
I
breathed
then
as
you
do
,
without
labor
;
I
had
the
light
step
and
the
endurance
of
youth
,
<EOS>
I
could
fast
,
I
could
sleep
on
the
hard
ground
.
<EOS>
I
had
wedded
poverty
,
and
I
loved
my
bride
 
for
poverty
to
me
was
freedom
.
<EOS>
My
heart
exulted
as
if
it
had
been
the
heart
of
Moses
ben
Maimon
,
strong
with
the
strength
of
three
score
years
,
and
knowing
the
work
that
was
to
fill
them
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
first
time
I
had
been
south
;
the
soul
within
me
felt
its
former
sun
;
and
standing
on
the
quay
,
where
the
ground
I
stood
on
seemed
to
send
forth
light
,
and
the
shadows
had
an
azure
glory
as
of
spirits
become
visible
<EOS>
,
I
felt
myself
in
the
flood
of
a
glorious
life
,
wherein
my
own
small
year
-
counted
existence
seemed
to
melt
,
so
that
I
knew
it
not
;
and
a
great
sob
arose
within
me
as
at
the
rush
of
waters
that
were
too
strong
a
bliss
.
<EOS>
So
I
stood
there
awaiting
my
companion
;
and
I
saw
him
not
till
he
said
:
"
Ezra
,
I
have
been
to
the
post
and
there
is
your
letter
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ezra
!
"
exclaimed
Deronda
,
unable
to
contain
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ezra
,
"
repeated
Mordecai
,
affirmatively
,
engrossed
in
memory
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
expecting
a
letter
;
for
I
wrote
continually
to
my
mother
.
<EOS>
And
that
sound
of
my
name
was
like
the
touch
of
a
wand
that
recalled
me
to
the
body
wherefrom
I
had
been
released
as
it
were
to
mingle
with
the
ocean
of
human
existence
,
free
from
the
pressure
of
individual
bondage
.
<EOS>
I
opened
the
letter
;
and
the
name
came
again
as
a
cry
that
would
have
disturbed
me
in
the
bosom
of
heaven
,
and
made
me
yearn
to
reach
where
that
sorrow
was
 
"
Ezra
,
my
son
!
"
<EOS>
"
  
Mordecai
paused
again
,
his
imagination
arrested
by
the
grasp
of
that
long
-
passed
moment
.
<EOS>
Deronda
's
mind
was
almost
breathlessly
suspended
on
what
was
coming
.
<EOS>
A
strange
possibility
had
suddenly
presented
itself
.
<EOS>
Mordecai
's
eyes
were
cast
down
in
abstracted
contemplation
,
and
in
a
few
moments
he
went
on
    
<EOS>
"
She
was
a
mother
of
whom
it
might
have
come
 
<EOS>
yea
,
might
have
come
to
be
said
,
"
Her
children
arise
up
and
call
her
blessed
.
<EOS>
"
In
her
I
understood
the
meaning
of
that
Master
who
,
perceiving
the
footsteps
of
his
mother
,
rose
up
and
said
,
"
The
Majesty
of
the
Eternal
cometh
near
!
"
<EOS>
And
that
letter
was
her
cry
from
the
depths
of
anguish
and
desolation
 
the
cry
of
a
mother
robbed
of
her
little
ones
.
<EOS>
I
was
her
eldest
.
<EOS>
Death
had
taken
four
babes
one
after
the
other
.
<EOS>
Then
came
,
late
,
my
little
sister
,
who
was
,
more
than
all
the
rest
,
the
desire
of
my
mother
's
eyes
;
and
the
letter
was
a
piercing
cry
to
me
 
<EOS>
"
Ezra
,
my
son
,
I
am
robbed
of
her
.
<EOS>
He
has
taken
her
away
and
left
disgrace
behind
.
<EOS>
They
will
never
come
again
.
"
<EOS>
"
 
Here
Mordecai
lifted
his
eyes
suddenly
,
laid
his
hand
on
Deronda
's
arm
,
and
said
,
"
Mine
was
the
lot
of
Israel
.
<EOS>
For
the
sin
of
the
father
my
soul
must
go
into
exile
.
<EOS>
For
the
sin
of
the
father
the
work
was
broken
,
and
the
day
of
fulfilment
delayed
.
<EOS>
She
who
bore
me
was
desolate
,
disgraced
,
destitute
.
<EOS>
I
turned
back
.
<EOS>
On
the
instant
I
turned
 
her
spirit
and
the
spirit
of
her
fathers
,
who
had
worthy
Jewish
hearts
,
moved
within
me
,
and
drew
me
.
<EOS>
God
,
in
whom
dwells
the
universe
,
was
within
me
as
the
strength
of
obedience
.
<EOS>
I
turned
and
traveled
with
hardship
 
to
save
the
scant
money
which
she
would
need
.
<EOS>
I
left
the
sunshine
,
and
traveled
into
freezing
cold
.
<EOS>
In
the
last
stage
I
spent
a
night
in
exposure
to
cold
and
snow
.
<EOS>
And
that
was
the
beginning
of
this
slow
death
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mordecai
let
his
eyes
wander
again
and
removed
his
hand
.
<EOS>
Deronda
resolutely
repressed
the
questions
which
urged
themselves
within
him
.
<EOS>
While
Mordecai
was
in
this
state
of
emotion
,
no
other
confidence
must
be
sought
than
what
came
spontaneously
:
nay
,
he
himself
felt
a
kindred
emotion
which
made
him
dread
his
own
speech
as
too
momentous
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
worked
.
<EOS>
We
were
destitute
 
<EOS>
every
thing
had
been
seized
.
<EOS>
And
she
was
ill
:
the
clutch
of
anguish
was
too
strong
for
her
,
and
wrought
with
some
lurking
disease
.
<EOS>
At
times
she
could
not
stand
for
the
beating
of
her
heart
,
and
the
images
in
her
brain
became
as
chambers
of
terror
,
where
she
beheld
my
sister
reared
in
evil
.
<EOS>
In
the
dead
of
night
I
heard
her
crying
for
her
child
.
<EOS>
Then
I
rose
,
and
we
stretched
forth
our
arms
together
and
prayed
.
<EOS>
We
poured
forth
our
souls
in
desire
that
Mirah
might
be
delivered
from
evil
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mirah
?
"
<EOS>
Deronda
repeated
,
wishing
to
assure
,
himself
that
his
ears
had
not
been
deceived
by
a
forecasting
imagination
.
<EOS>
"
Did
you
say
Mirah
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
was
my
little
sister
's
name
.
<EOS>
After
we
had
prayed
for
her
,
my
mother
would
rest
awhile
.
<EOS>
It
lasted
hardly
four
years
,
and
in
the
minute
before
she
died
,
we
were
praying
the
same
prayer
 
<EOS>
I
aloud
,
she
silently
.
<EOS>
Her
soul
went
out
upon
its
wings
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
never
since
heard
of
your
sister
?
<EOS>
"
said
Deronda
,
as
quietly
as
he
could
.
  
<EOS>
"
Never
.
<EOS>
Never
have
I
heard
whether
she
was
delivered
according
to
our
prayer
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
,
I
know
not
.
<EOS>
Who
shall
say
where
the
pathways
lie
?
<EOS>
The
poisonous
will
of
the
wicked
is
strong
.
<EOS>
It
poisoned
my
life
 
it
is
slowly
stifling
this
breath
.
<EOS>
Death
delivered
my
mother
,
and
I
felt
it
a
blessedness
that
I
was
alone
in
the
winters
of
suffering
.
<EOS>
But
what
are
the
winters
now
?
 
<EOS>
they
are
far
off
"
 
here
<EOS>
Mordecai
again
rested
his
hand
on
Deronda
's
arm
,
and
looked
at
him
with
that
joy
of
the
hectic
patient
which
pierces
us
to
sadness
 
<EOS>
"
there
is
nothing
to
wail
in
the
withering
of
my
body
.
<EOS>
The
work
will
be
the
better
done
.
<EOS>
Once
I
said
the
work
of
this
beginning
was
mine
,
I
am
born
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
Well
,
I
shall
do
it
.
<EOS>
I
shall
live
in
you
.
<EOS>
I
shall
live
in
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
grasp
had
become
convulsive
in
its
force
,
and
Deronda
,
agitated
as
he
had
never
been
before
 
<EOS>
the
certainty
that
this
was
Mirah
's
brother
suffusing
his
own
strange
relation
to
Mordecai
with
a
new
solemnity
and
tenderness
 
felt
his
strong
young
heart
beating
faster
and
his
lips
paling
.
<EOS>
He
shrank
from
speech
.
<EOS>
He
feared
,
in
Mordecai
's
present
state
of
exaltation
(
already
an
alarming
strain
on
his
feeble
frame
)
,
to
utter
a
word
of
revelation
about
Mirah
.
<EOS>
He
feared
to
make
an
answer
below
that
high
pitch
of
expectation
which
resembled
a
flash
from
a
dying
fire
,
making
watchers
fear
to
see
it
die
the
faster
.
<EOS>
His
dominant
impulse
was
to
do
as
he
had
once
done
before
:
he
laid
his
firm
,
gentle
hand
on
the
hand
that
grasped
him
.
<EOS>
Mordecai
's
,
as
if
it
had
a
soul
of
its
own
 
for
he
was
not
distinctly
willing
to
do
what
he
did
 
relaxed
its
grasp
,
and
turned
upward
under
Deronda
's
.
<EOS>
As
the
two
palms
met
and
pressed
each
other
Mordecai
recovered
some
sense
of
his
surroundings
,
and
said
    
"
Let
us
go
now
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
talk
any
longer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
in
fact
they
parted
at
Cohen
's
door
without
having
spoken
to
each
other
again
 
merely
with
another
pressure
of
the
hands
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
felt
a
weight
on
him
which
was
half
joy
,
half
anxiety
.
<EOS>
The
joy
of
finding
in
Mirah
's
brother
a
nature
even
more
than
worthy
of
that
relation
to
her
,
had
the
weight
of
solemnity
and
sadness
;
the
reunion
of
brother
and
sister
was
in
reality
the
first
stage
of
a
supreme
parting
 
like
that
farewell
kiss
which
resembles
greeting
,
<EOS>
that
last
glance
of
love
which
becomes
the
sharpest
pang
of
sorrow
.
<EOS>
Then
there
was
the
weight
of
anxiety
about
the
revelation
of
the
fact
on
both
sides
,
and
the
arrangements
it
would
be
desirable
to
make
beforehand
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
we
should
all
have
felt
as
Deronda
did
,
without
sinking
into
snobbishness
or
the
notion
that
the
primal
duties
of
life
demand
a
morning
and
an
evening
suit
,
that
it
was
an
admissible
desire
to
free
Mirah
's
first
meeting
with
her
brother
from
all
jarring
outward
conditions
.
<EOS>
His
own
sense
of
deliverance
from
the
dreaded
relationship
of
the
other
Cohens
,
notwithstanding
their
good
nature
,
made
him
resolve
if
possible
to
keep
them
in
the
background
for
Mirah
,
until
her
acquaintance
with
them
would
be
an
unmarred
rendering
of
gratitude
for
any
kindness
they
had
shown
to
her
brother
.
<EOS>
On
all
accounts
he
wished
to
give
Mordecai
surroundings
not
only
more
suited
to
his
frail
bodily
condition
,
but
less
of
a
hindrance
to
easy
intercourse
,
even
apart
from
the
decisive
prospect
of
Mirah
's
taking
up
her
abode
with
her
brother
,
and
tending
him
through
the
precious
remnant
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
In
the
heroic
drama
,
great
recognitions
are
not
encumbered
with
these
details
;
and
certainly
Deronda
had
as
reverential
an
interest
in
Mordecai
and
Mirah
as
he
could
have
had
in
the
offspring
of
Agamemnon
;
but
he
was
caring
for
destinies
still
moving
in
the
dim
streets
of
our
earthly
life
,
not
yet
lifted
among
the
constellations
,
and
his
task
presented
itself
to
him
as
difficult
and
delicate
,
especially
in
persuading
Mordecai
to
change
his
abode
and
habits
.
<EOS>
Concerning
Mirah
's
feeling
and
resolve
he
had
no
doubt
:
there
would
be
a
complete
union
of
sentiment
toward
the
departed
mother
,
and
Mirah
would
understand
her
brother
's
greatness
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
greatness
:
<EOS>
that
was
the
word
which
Deronda
now
deliberately
chose
to
signify
the
impression
that
Mordecai
had
made
on
him
.
<EOS>
He
said
to
himself
,
perhaps
rather
defiantly
toward
the
more
negative
spirit
within
him
,
that
this
man
,
however
erratic
some
of
his
interpretations
might
be
 
<EOS>
this
consumptive
Jewish
workman
in
threadbare
clothing
,
lodged
by
charity
,
delivering
himself
to
hearers
who
took
his
thoughts
without
attaching
more
consequences
to
them
than
the
Flemings
to
the
ethereal
chimes
ringing
above
their
market
-
places
 
had
the
chief
elements
of
greatness
;
a
mind
consciously
,
energetically
moving
with
the
larger
march
of
human
destinies
,
but
not
the
less
full
of
conscience
and
tender
heart
for
the
footsteps
that
tread
near
and
need
a
leaning
-
place
;
capable
of
conceiving
and
choosing
a
life
's
task
with
far
-
off
issues
,
yet
capable
of
the
unapplauded
heroism
which
turns
off
the
road
of
achievement
at
the
call
of
the
nearer
duty
whose
effect
lies
within
the
beatings
of
the
hearts
that
are
close
to
us
,
as
the
hunger
of
the
unfledged
bird
to
the
breast
of
its
parent
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
to
-
night
was
stirred
with
,
the
feeling
that
the
brief
remnant
of
this
fervid
life
had
become
his
charge
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
peculiarly
wrought
on
by
what
he
had
seen
at
the
club
of
the
friendly
indifference
which
Mordecai
must
have
gone
on
encountering
.
<EOS>
His
own
experience
of
the
small
room
that
ardor
can
make
for
itself
in
ordinary
minds
had
had
the
effect
of
increasing
his
reserve
;
and
while
tolerance
was
the
easiest
attitude
to
him
,
there
was
another
bent
in
him
also
capable
of
becoming
a
weakness
 
the
dislike
to
appear
exceptional
or
to
risk
an
ineffective
insistance
on
his
own
opinion
.
<EOS>
But
such
caution
appeared
contemptible
to
him
just
now
,
when
he
,
for
the
first
time
,
saw
in
a
complete
picture
and
felt
as
a
reality
the
lives
that
burn
themselves
out
in
solitary
enthusiasm
:
martyrs
of
obscure
circumstance
,
exiled
in
the
rarity
of
their
own
minds
,
whose
deliverances
in
other
ears
are
no
more
than
a
long
passionate
<EOS>
soliloquy
 
<EOS>
unless
perhaps
at
last
,
when
they
are
nearing
the
invisible
shores
,
signs
of
recognition
and
fulfilment
may
penetrate
the
cloud
of
loneliness
;
or
perhaps
it
may
be
with
them
as
with
the
dying
Copernicus
made
to
touch
the
first
printed
copy
of
his
book
when
the
sense
of
touch
was
gone
,
seeing
it
only
as
a
dim
object
through
the
deepening
dusk
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
had
been
brought
near
to
one
of
those
spiritual
exiles
,
and
it
was
in
his
nature
to
feel
the
relation
as
a
strong
chain
,
nay
,
to
feel
his
imagination
moving
without
repugnance
in
the
direction
of
Mordecai
's
desires
.
<EOS>
With
all
his
latent
objection
to
schemes
only
definite
in
their
generality
and
nebulous
in
detail
 
in
the
poise
of
his
sentiments
he
felt
at
one
with
this
man
who
had
made
a
visionary
selection
of
him
:
the
lines
of
what
may
be
called
their
emotional
theory
touched
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
the
Jewish
consciousness
,
but
he
had
a
yearning
,
grown
the
stronger
for
the
denial
which
had
been
his
grievance
,
after
the
obligation
of
avowed
filial
and
social
ties
.
<EOS>
His
feeling
was
ready
for
difficult
obedience
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
it
came
that
he
set
about
his
new
task
ungrudgingly
;
and
again
he
thought
of
Mrs.
Meyrick
as
his
chief
helper
.
<EOS>
To
her
first
he
must
make
known
the
discovery
of
Mirah
's
brother
,
and
with
her
he
must
consult
on
all
preliminaries
of
bringing
the
mutually
lost
together
.
<EOS>
Happily
the
best
quarter
for
a
consumptive
patient
did
not
lie
too
far
off
the
small
house
at
Chelsea
,
and
the
first
office
Deronda
had
to
perform
for
this
Hebrew
prophet
who
claimed
him
as
a
spiritual
inheritor
,
was
to
get
him
a
healthy
lodging
.
<EOS>
Such
is
the
irony
of
earthly
mixtures
,
that
the
heroes
have
not
always
had
carpets
and
teacups
of
their
own
;
and
,
seen
through
the
open
window
by
the
mackerel
-
vender
,
may
have
been
invited
with
some
hopefulness
to
pay
three
hundred
per
cent
,
in
the
form
of
fourpence
.
<EOS>
However
,
Deronda
's
mind
was
busy
with
a
prospective
arrangement
for
giving
a
furnished
lodging
some
faint
likeness
to
a
refined
home
by
dismantling
his
own
chambers
of
his
best
old
books
in
vellum
,
his
easiest
chair
,
and
the
bas
-
reliefs
of
Milton
and
Dante
.
  
<EOS>
But
was
not
Mirah
to
be
there
?
<EOS>
What
furniture
can
give
such
finish
to
a
room
as
a
tender
woman
's
face
?
 
and
is
there
any
harmony
of
tints
that
has
such
stirrings
of
delight
as
the
sweet
modulation
of
her
voice
?
<EOS>
Here
is
one
good
,
at
least
,
thought
Deronda
,
that
comes
to
Mordecai
from
his
having
fixed
his
imagination
on
me
.
<EOS>
He
has
recovered
a
perfect
sister
,
whose
affection
is
waiting
for
him
.

Fairy

<EOS>
Thus
all
beauty
that
appears
  
Has
birth
as
sound
to
finer
sense
  
And
lighter
-
clad
intelligence
.
   
<EOS>
And
Gwendolen
?
<EOS>
She
was
thinking
of
Deronda
much
more
than
he
was
thinking
of
her
 
often
wondering
what
were
his
ideas
"
about
things
,
"
and
how
his
life
was
occupied
.
<EOS>
But
a
lap
-
dog
would
be
necessarily
at
a
loss
in
framing
to
itself
the
motives
and
adventures
of
doghood
at
large
;
and
it
was
as
far
from
Gwendolen
's
conception
that
Deronda
's
life
could
be
determined
by
the
historical
destiny
of
the
Jews
,
as
that
he
could
rise
into
the
air
on
a
brazen
horse
,
and
so
vanish
from
her
horizon
in
the
form
of
a
twinkling
star
.
  
<EOS>
With
all
the
sense
of
inferiority
that
had
been
forced
upon
her
,
it
was
inevitable
that
she
should
imagine
a
larger
place
for
herself
in
his
thoughts
than
she
actually
possessed
.
<EOS>
They
must
be
rather
old
and
wise
persons
who
are
not
apt
to
see
their
own
anxiety
or
elation
about
themselves
reflected
in
other
minds
;
and
Gwendolen
,
with
her
youth
and
inward
solitude
,
may
be
excused
for
dwelling
on
signs
of
special
interest
in
her
shown
by
the
one
person
who
had
impressed
her
with
the
feeling
of
submission
,
and
for
mistaking
the
color
and
proportion
of
those
signs
in
the
mind
of
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
what
would
he
tell
her
that
she
ought
to
do
?
"
<EOS>
He
said
,
I
must
get
more
interest
in
others
,
and
more
knowledge
,
and
that
I
must
care
about
the
best
things
 
but
how
am
I
to
begin
?
"
<EOS>
She
wondered
what
books
he
would
tell
her
to
take
up
to
her
own
room
,
and
recalled
the
famous
writers
that
she
had
either
not
looked
into
or
had
found
the
most
unreadable
,
with
a
half
-
smiling
wish
that
she
could
mischievously
ask
Deronda
if
they
were
not
the
books
called
"
medicine
for
the
mind
.
"
<EOS>
Then
she
repented
of
her
sauciness
,
and
when
she
was
safe
from
observation
<EOS>
carried
up
a
miscellaneous
selection
 
Descartes
,
Bacon
,
Locke
,
Butler
,
Burke
,
<EOS>
Guizot
 
knowing
,
as
a
clever
young
lady
of
education
,
that
these
authors
were
ornaments
of
mankind
,
feeling
sure
that
Deronda
had
read
them
,
and
hoping
that
by
dipping
into
them
all
in
succession
,
with
her
rapid
understanding
she
might
get
a
point
of
view
nearer
to
his
level
.
  
<EOS>
But
it
was
astonishing
how
little
time
she
found
for
these
vast
mental
excursions
.
<EOS>
Constantly
she
had
to
be
on
the
scene
as
Mrs.
Grandcourt
,
and
to
feel
herself
watched
in
that
part
by
the
exacting
eyes
of
a
husband
who
had
found
a
motive
to
exercise
his
tenacity
 
that
of
making
his
marriage
answer
all
the
ends
he
chose
,
and
with
the
more
completeness
the
more
he
discerned
any
opposing
will
in
her
.
<EOS>
And
she
herself
,
whatever
rebellion
might
be
going
on
within
her
,
could
not
have
made
up
her
mind
to
failure
in
her
representation
.
<EOS>
No
feeling
had
yet
reconciled
her
for
a
moment
to
any
act
,
word
,
or
look
that
would
be
a
confession
to
the
world
:
and
what
she
most
dreaded
in
herself
was
any
violent
impulse
that
would
make
an
involuntary
confession
:
it
was
the
will
to
be
silent
in
every
other
direction
that
had
thrown
the
more
impetuosity
into
her
confidences
toward
Deronda
,
to
whom
her
thought
continually
turned
as
a
help
against
herself
.
<EOS>
Her
riding
,
her
hunting
,
her
visiting
and
receiving
of
visits
,
were
all
performed
in
a
spirit
of
achievement
which
served
instead
of
zest
and
young
gladness
,
so
that
all
around
Diplow
,
in
those
weeks
of
the
new
year
,
Mrs.
Grandcourt
was
regarded
as
wearing
her
honors
with
triumph
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
disguises
it
under
an
air
of
taking
everything
as
a
matter
of
course
,
"
said
Mrs.
Arrowpoint
.
<EOS>
"
A
stranger
might
suppose
that
she
had
condescended
rather
than
risen
.
<EOS>
I
always
noticed
that
doubleness
in
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
To
her
mother
most
of
all
Gwendolen
was
bent
on
acting
complete
satisfaction
,
and
poor
Mrs.
Davilow
was
so
far
deceived
that
she
took
the
unexpected
distance
at
which
she
was
kept
,
in
spite
of
what
she
felt
to
be
Grandcourt
's
handsome
behavior
in
providing
for
her
,
as
a
comparative
indifference
in
her
daughter
,
now
that
marriage
had
created
new
interests
.
<EOS>
To
be
fetched
to
lunch
and
then
to
dinner
along
with
the
Gascoignes
,
to
be
driven
back
soon
after
breakfast
the
next
morning
,
and
to
have
brief
calls
from
Gwendolen
in
which
her
husband
waited
for
her
outside
either
on
horseback
or
sitting
in
the
carriage
,
was
all
the
intercourse
allowed
to
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
The
truth
was
,
that
the
second
time
Gwendolen
proposed
to
invite
her
mother
with
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gascoigne
,
Grandcourt
had
at
first
been
silent
,
and
then
drawled
,
"
We
ca
n't
be
having
_
those
people
_
always
.
<EOS>
Gascoigne
talks
too
much
.
<EOS>
Country
clergy
are
always
bores
 
with
their
confounded
fuss
about
everything
.
"
  
<EOS>
That
speech
was
full
of
foreboding
for
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
To
have
her
mother
classed
under
"
those
people
"
was
enough
to
confirm
the
previous
dread
of
bringing
her
too
near
.
<EOS>
Still
,
she
could
not
give
the
true
reasons
 
<EOS>
she
could
not
say
to
her
mother
,
"
Mr.
Grandcourt
wants
to
recognize
you
as
little
as
possible
;
and
besides
it
is
better
you
should
not
see
much
of
my
married
life
,
else
you
might
find
out
that
I
am
miserable
.
"
<EOS>
So
she
waived
as
lightly
as
she
could
every
allusion
to
the
subject
;
and
when
Mrs.
Davilow
again
hinted
the
possibility
of
her
having
a
house
close
to
Ryelands
<EOS>
,
Gwendolen
said
,
"
It
would
not
be
so
nice
for
you
as
being
near
the
rectory
here
,
mamma
.
<EOS>
We
shall
perhaps
be
very
little
at
Ryelands
.
<EOS>
You
would
miss
my
aunt
and
uncle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
all
the
while
this
contemptuous
veto
of
her
husband
's
on
any
intimacy
with
her
family
,
making
her
proudly
shrink
from
giving
them
the
aspect
of
troublesome
pensioners
,
was
rousing
more
inward
inclination
toward
them
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
felt
so
kindly
toward
her
uncle
,
so
much
disposed
to
look
back
on
his
cheerful
,
complacent
activity
and
spirit
of
kind
management
,
even
when
mistaken
,
as
more
of
a
comfort
than
the
neutral
loftiness
which
was
every
day
chilling
her
.
<EOS>
And
here
perhaps
she
was
unconsciously
finding
some
of
that
mental
enlargement
which
it
was
hard
to
get
from
her
occasional
dashes
into
difficult
authors
,
who
instead
of
blending
themselves
with
her
daily
agitations
required
her
to
dismiss
them
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
delightful
surprise
one
day
when
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gascoigne
were
at
Offendene
to
see
Gwendolen
ride
up
without
her
husband
 
with
the
groom
only
.
<EOS>
All
,
including
the
four
girls
and
Miss
Merry
,
seated
in
the
dining
-
room
at
lunch
,
could
see
the
welcome
approach
;
and
even
the
elder
ones
were
not
without
something
of
Isabel
's
romantic
sense
that
the
beautiful
sister
on
the
splendid
chestnut
,
which
held
its
head
as
if
proud
to
bear
her
,
was
a
sort
of
Harriet
Byron
or
Miss
Wardour
reappearing
out
of
her
"
happiness
ever
after
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
uncle
went
to
the
door
to
give
her
his
hand
,
and
she
sprang
from
her
horse
with
an
air
of
alacrity
which
might
well
encourage
that
notion
of
guaranteed
happiness
;
for
Gwendolen
was
particularly
bent
to
-
day
on
setting
her
mother
's
heart
at
rest
,
and
her
unusual
sense
of
freedom
in
being
able
to
make
this
visit
alone
enabled
her
to
bear
up
under
the
pressure
of
painful
facts
which
were
urging
themselves
anew
.
<EOS>
The
seven
family
kisses
were
not
so
tiresome
as
they
used
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Grandcourt
is
gone
out
,
so
I
determined
to
fill
up
the
time
by
coming
to
you
,
mamma
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
as
she
laid
down
her
hat
and
seated
herself
next
to
her
mother
;
and
then
looking
at
her
with
a
playfully
monitory
air
,
"
That
is
a
punishment
to
you
for
not
wearing
better
lace
on
your
head
.
<EOS>
You
did
n't
think
I
should
come
and
detect
you
 
<EOS>
you
dreadfully
careless
-
about
-
yourself
mamma
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
gave
a
caressing
touch
to
the
dear
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Scold
me
,
dear
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
her
delicate
worn
face
flushing
with
delight
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
wish
there
was
something
you
could
eat
after
your
ride
 
instead
of
these
scraps
.
<EOS>
Let
Jocosa
make
you
a
cup
of
chocolate
in
your
old
way
.
<EOS>
You
used
to
like
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Merry
immediately
rose
and
went
out
,
though
Gwendolen
said
,
"
Oh
,
no
,
a
piece
of
bread
,
or
one
of
those
hard
biscuits
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
think
about
eating
.
<EOS>
I
am
come
to
say
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
going
to
Ryelands
again
?
"
said
Mr.
Gascoigne
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
we
are
going
to
town
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
beginning
to
break
up
a
piece
of
bread
,
but
putting
no
morsel
into
her
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
rather
early
to
go
to
town
,
"
said
Mrs.
Gascoigne
,
"
and
Mr.
Grandcourt
not
in
Parliament
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
there
is
only
one
more
day
's
hunting
to
be
had
,
and
Henleigh
has
some
business
in
town
with
lawyers
,
I
think
,
"
said
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
glad
.
<EOS>
I
shall
like
to
go
to
town
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
see
your
house
in
Grosvenor
Square
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
.
<EOS>
She
and
the
girls
were
devouring
with
their
eyes
every
movement
of
their
goddess
,
soon
to
vanish
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
in
a
tone
of
assent
to
the
interest
of
that
expectation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
there
is
so
much
to
be
seen
and
done
in
town
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
,
my
dear
Gwendolen
,
"
said
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
in
a
kind
of
cordial
advice
,
"
that
you
would
use
your
influence
with
Mr.
Grandcourt
to
induce
him
to
enter
Parliament
.
<EOS>
A
man
of
his
position
should
make
his
weight
felt
in
politics
.
<EOS>
The
best
judges
are
confident
that
the
ministry
will
have
to
appeal
to
the
country
on
this
question
of
further
Reform
,
and
Mr.
Grandcourt
should
be
ready
for
the
opportunity
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
quite
sure
that
his
opinions
and
mine
accord
entirely
<EOS>
;
I
have
not
heard
him
express
himself
very
fully
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
look
at
the
matter
from
that
point
of
view
.
<EOS>
I
am
thinking
of
your
husband
's
standing
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
And
he
has
now
come
to
that
stage
of
life
when
a
man
like
him
should
enter
into
public
affairs
.
<EOS>
A
wife
has
great
influence
with
her
husband
.
<EOS>
Use
yours
in
that
direction
,
my
dear
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
rector
felt
that
he
was
acquitting
himself
of
a
duty
here
,
and
giving
something
like
the
aspect
of
a
public
benefit
to
his
niece
's
match
.
<EOS>
To
Gwendolen
the
whole
speech
had
the
flavor
of
bitter
comedy
.
<EOS>
If
she
had
been
merry
,
she
must
have
laughed
at
her
uncle
's
explanation
to
her
that
he
had
not
heard
Grandcourt
express
himself
very
fully
on
politics
.
<EOS>
And
the
wife
's
great
influence
!
<EOS>
General
maxims
about
husbands
and
wives
seemed
now
of
a
precarious
usefulness
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
herself
had
once
believed
in
her
future
influence
as
an
omnipotence
in
managing
 
<EOS>
she
did
not
know
exactly
what
.
<EOS>
But
her
chief
concern
at
present
was
to
give
an
answer
that
would
be
felt
appropriate
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
very
glad
,
uncle
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
Mr.
Grandcourt
would
not
like
the
trouble
of
an
election
 
at
least
,
unless
it
could
be
without
his
making
speeches
.
<EOS>
I
thought
candidates
always
made
speeches
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
necessarily
 
to
any
great
extent
,
"
said
Mr.
Gascoigne
.
<EOS>
"
A
man
of
position
and
weight
can
get
on
without
much
of
it
.
<EOS>
A
county
member
need
have
very
little
trouble
in
that
way
,
and
both
out
of
the
House
and
in
it
is
liked
the
better
for
not
being
a
speechifier
.
<EOS>
Tell
Mr.
Grandcourt
that
I
say
so
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Here
comes
Jocosa
with
my
chocolate
after
all
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
escaping
from
a
promise
to
give
information
that
would
certainly
have
been
received
in
a
way
inconceivable
to
the
good
rector
,
who
,
pushing
his
chair
a
little
aside
from
the
table
and
crossing
his
leg
,
looked
as
well
as
if
he
felt
like
a
worthy
specimen
of
a
clergyman
and
magistrate
giving
experienced
advice
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gascoigne
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
Grandcourt
was
a
proud
man
,
but
his
own
self
-
love
,
calmed
through
life
by
the
consciousness
of
his
general
value
and
personal
advantages
,
was
not
irritable
enough
to
prevent
him
from
hoping
the
best
about
his
niece
's
husband
because
her
uncle
was
kept
rather
haughtily
at
a
distance
.
<EOS>
A
certain
aloofness
must
be
allowed
to
the
representative
of
an
old
family
;
you
would
not
expect
him
to
be
on
intimate
terms
even
with
abstractions
.
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Gascoigne
was
less
dispassionate
on
her
husband
's
account
,
and
felt
Grandcourt
's
haughtiness
as
something
a
little
blameable
in
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
uncle
and
Anna
will
very
likely
be
in
town
about
Easter
,
"
she
said
,
with
a
vague
sense
of
expressing
a
slight
discontent
.
"
<EOS>
Dear
Rex
hopes
to
come
out
with
honors
and
a
fellowship
,
and
he
wants
his
father
and
Anna
to
meet
him
in
London
,
that
they
may
be
jolly
together
,
as
he
says
.
<EOS>
I
should
n't
wonder
if
Lord
Brackenshaw
invited
them
,
he
has
been
so
very
kind
since
he
came
back
to
the
Castle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
my
uncle
will
bring
Ann
to
stay
in
Grosvenor
Square
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
risking
herself
so
far
,
for
the
sake
of
the
present
moment
,
but
in
reality
wishing
that
she
might
never
be
obliged
to
bring
any
of
her
family
near
Grandcourt
again
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
glad
of
Rex
's
good
fortune
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
not
be
premature
,
and
rejoice
too
much
beforehand
,
"
said
the
rector
,
to
whom
this
topic
was
the
happiest
in
the
world
,
and
altogether
allowable
,
now
that
the
issue
of
that
little
affair
about
Gwendolen
had
been
so
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Not
but
that
I
am
in
correspondence
with
impartial
judges
,
who
have
the
highest
hopes
about
my
son
,
as
a
singularly
clear
-
headed
young
man
.
<EOS>
And
of
his
excellent
disposition
and
principle
I
have
had
the
best
evidence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
have
him
a
great
lawyer
some
time
,
"
said
Mrs.
Gascoigne
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
very
nice
!
"
said
Gwendolen
,
with
a
concealed
scepticism
as
to
niceness
in
general
,
which
made
the
word
quite
applicable
to
lawyers
.
  
<EOS>
"
Talking
of
Lord
Brackenshaw
's
kindness
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
"
you
do
n't
know
how
delightful
he
has
been
,
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
He
has
begged
me
to
consider
myself
his
guest
in
this
house
till
I
can
get
another
<EOS>
that
I
like
 
<EOS>
he
did
it
in
the
most
graceful
way
.
<EOS>
But
now
a
house
has
turned
up
.
<EOS>
Old
Mr.
Jodson
is
dead
,
and
we
can
have
his
house
.
<EOS>
It
is
just
what
I
want
;
small
,
but
with
nothing
hideous
to
make
you
miserable
thinking
about
it
.
<EOS>
And
it
is
only
a
mile
from
the
Rectory
.
<EOS>
You
remember
the
low
white
house
nearly
hidden
by
the
trees
,
as
we
turn
up
the
lane
to
the
church
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
but
you
have
no
furniture
,
poor
mamma
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
in
a
melancholy
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
am
saving
money
for
that
.
<EOS>
You
know
who
has
made
me
rather
rich
,
dear
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
laying
her
hand
on
Gwendolen
's
.
"
<EOS>
And
Jocosa
really
makes
so
little
do
for
housekeeping
 
<EOS>
it
is
quite
wonderful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
please
let
me
go
up
-
stairs
with
you
and
arrange
my
hat
,
mamma
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
suddenly
putting
up
her
hand
to
her
hair
and
perhaps
creating
a
desired
disarrangement
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
was
swelling
,
and
she
was
ready
to
cry
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
_
must
_
have
been
worse
off
,
if
it
had
not
been
for
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
shall
never
see
all
this
again
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
looking
round
her
,
as
they
entered
the
black
and
yellow
bedroom
,
and
then
throwing
herself
into
a
chair
in
front
of
the
glass
with
a
little
groan
as
of
bodily
fatigue
.
<EOS>
In
the
resolve
not
to
cry
she
had
become
very
pale
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
well
,
dear
?
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
that
chocolate
has
made
me
sick
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
putting
up
her
hand
to
be
taken
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
allowed
to
come
to
you
if
you
were
ill
,
darling
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
,
rather
timidly
,
as
she
pressed
the
hand
to
her
bosom
.
<EOS>
Something
had
made
her
sure
today
that
her
child
loved
her
 
needed
her
as
much
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
leaning
her
head
against
her
mother
,
though
speaking
as
lightly
as
she
could
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
know
I
never
am
ill
.
<EOS>
I
am
as
strong
as
possible
;
and
you
must
not
take
to
fretting
about
me
,
but
make
yourself
as
happy
as
you
can
with
the
girls
.
<EOS>
They
are
better
children
to
you
than
I
have
been
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
She
turned
up
her
face
with
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
always
been
good
,
my
darling
.
<EOS>
I
remember
nothing
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
did
I
ever
do
that
was
good
to
you
,
except
marry
Mr.
Grandcourt
?
"
said
Gwendolen
,
starting
up
with
a
desperate
resolve
to
be
playful
,
and
keep
no
more
on
the
perilous
edge
of
agitation
.
<EOS>
"
And
I
should
not
have
done
that
unless
it
had
pleased
myself
.
"
<EOS>
She
tossed
up
her
chin
,
and
reached
her
hat
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
forbid
,
child
!
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
had
you
marry
for
my
sake
.
<EOS>
Your
happiness
by
itself
is
half
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Very
well
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
arranging
her
hat
fastidiously
,
"
then
you
will
please
to
consider
that
you
are
half
happy
,
which
is
more
than
I
am
used
to
seeing
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
the
last
words
she
again
turned
with
her
old
playful
smile
to
her
mother
.
<EOS>
"
Now
I
am
ready
;
but
oh
,
mamma
,
Mr.
Grandcourt
gives
me
a
quantity
of
money
,
and
expects
me
to
spend
it
,
and
I
ca
n't
spend
it
;
and
you
know
I
ca
n't
bear
charity
children
and
all
that
;
and
here
are
thirty
pounds
.
<EOS>
I
wish
the
girls
would
spend
it
for
me
on
little
things
for
themselves
when
you
go
to
the
new
house
.
<EOS>
Tell
them
so
.
"
<EOS>
Gwendolen
put
the
notes
into
her
mother
's
hands
and
looked
away
hastily
,
moving
toward
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
,
dear
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
please
them
so
that
you
should
have
thought
of
them
in
particular
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
they
are
troublesome
things
;
but
they
do
n't
trouble
me
now
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
turning
and
nodding
playfully
.
<EOS>
She
hardly
understood
her
own
feeling
in
this
act
toward
her
sisters
,
but
at
any
rate
she
did
not
wish
it
to
be
taken
as
anything
serious
.
<EOS>
She
was
glad
to
have
got
out
of
the
bedroom
without
showing
more
signs
of
emotion
,
and
she
went
through
the
rest
of
her
visit
and
all
the
good
-
byes
with
a
quiet
propriety
that
made
her
say
to
herself
sarcastically
as
she
rode
away
,
"
I
think
I
am
making
a
very
good
Mrs.
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
believed
that
her
husband
had
gone
to
Gadsmere
<EOS>
that
day
 
had
inferred
this
,
as
she
had
long
ago
inferred
who
were
the
inmates
of
what
he
had
described
as
"
a
dog
-
hutch
of
a
place
in
a
black
country
;
"
and
the
strange
conflict
of
feeling
within
her
had
had
the
characteristic
effect
of
sending
her
to
Offendene
with
a
tightened
resolve
 
a
form
of
excitement
which
was
native
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
wondered
at
her
own
contradictions
.
<EOS>
Why
should
she
feel
it
bitter
to
her
that
Grandcourt
showed
concern
for
the
beings
on
whose
account
she
herself
was
undergoing
remorse
?
<EOS>
Had
she
not
before
her
marriage
inwardly
determined
to
speak
and
act
on
their
behalf
?
 
<EOS>
and
since
he
had
lately
implied
that
he
wanted
to
be
in
town
because
he
was
making
arrangements
about
his
will
,
she
ought
to
have
been
glad
of
any
sign
that
he
kept
a
conscience
awake
toward
those
at
Gadsmere
;
and
<EOS>
yet
,
now
that
she
was
a
wife
,
the
sense
that
Grandcourt
was
gone
to
Gadsmere
was
like
red
heat
near
a
burn
.
<EOS>
She
had
brought
on
herself
this
indignity
in
her
own
eyes
 
<EOS>
this
humiliation
of
being
doomed
to
a
terrified
silence
lest
her
husband
should
discover
with
what
sort
of
consciousness
she
had
married
him
;
and
as
she
had
said
to
Deronda
,
she
"
must
go
on
.
"
<EOS>
After
the
intense
moments
of
secret
hatred
toward
this
husband
who
from
the
very
first
had
cowed
her
,
there
always
came
back
the
spiritual
pressure
which
made
submission
inevitable
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
effort
at
freedoms
that
would
not
bring
fresh
and
worse
humiliation
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
could
dare
nothing
except
an
impulsive
action
 
least
of
all
could
she
dare
premeditatedly
a
vague
future
in
which
the
only
certain
condition
was
indignity
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
remorse
,
it
still
seemed
the
worst
result
of
her
marriage
that
she
should
in
any
way
make
a
spectacle
of
herself
;
and
her
humiliation
was
lightened
by
her
thinking
that
only
Mrs.
Glasher
was
aware
of
the
fact
which
caused
it
.
<EOS>
For
Gwendolen
had
never
referred
the
interview
at
the
Whispering
Stones
to
Lush
's
agency
;
her
disposition
to
vague
terror
investing
with
shadowy
omnipresence
<EOS>
any
threat
of
fatal
power
over
her
,
and
so
hindering
her
from
imagining
plans
and
channels
by
which
news
had
been
conveyed
to
the
woman
who
had
the
poisoning
skill
of
a
sorceress
.
<EOS>
To
Gwendolen
's
mind
the
secret
lay
with
Mrs.
Glasher
,
and
there
were
words
in
the
horrible
letter
which
implied
that
Mrs.
Glasher
would
dread
disclosure
to
the
husband
,
as
much
as
the
usurping
Mrs.
Grandcourt
.
  
<EOS>
Something
else
,
too
,
she
thought
of
as
more
of
a
secret
from
her
husband
than
it
really
was
 
namely
that
suppressed
struggle
of
desperate
rebellion
which
she
herself
dreaded
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
could
not
indeed
fully
imagine
how
things
affected
Gwendolen
:
he
had
no
imagination
of
anything
in
her
but
<EOS>
what
affected
the
gratification
of
his
own
will
;
but
on
this
point
he
had
the
sensibility
which
seems
like
divination
.
<EOS>
What
we
see
exclusively
we
are
apt
to
see
with
some
mistake
of
proportions
;
and
Grandcourt
was
not
likely
to
be
infallible
in
his
judgments
concerning
this
wife
who
was
governed
by
many
shadowy
powers
,
to
him
nonexistent
.
<EOS>
He
magnified
her
inward
resistance
,
but
that
did
not
lessen
his
satisfaction
in
the
mastery
of
it
.
      
<EOS>
Behold
my
lady
's
carriage
stop
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
With
powdered
lacquey
and
with
charming
bay
;
  
She
sweeps
the
matting
,
treads
the
crimson
stair
.
  
<EOS>
Her
arduous
function
solely
"
to
be
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
Like
Sirius
rising
o'er
the
silent
sea
.
  
<EOS>
She
hides
her
heart
in
lustre
loftily
.
   
<EOS>
So
the
Grandcourts
were
in
Grosvenor
Square
in
time
to
receive
a
card
for
the
musical
party
at
Lady
Mallinger
's
,
there
being
reasons
of
business
which
made
Sir
Hugo
know
beforehand
that
his
ill
-
beloved
nephew
was
coming
up
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
the
third
evening
after
their
arrival
,
and
Gwendolen
made
rather
an
absent
-
minded
acquaintance
with
her
new
ceilings
and
furniture
,
preoccupied
with
the
certainty
that
she
was
going
to
speak
to
Deronda
again
,
and
also
to
see
the
Miss
Lapidoth
who
had
gone
through
so
much
,
and
was
"
capable
of
submitting
to
anything
in
the
form
of
duty
.
<EOS>
"
For
Gwendolen
had
remembered
nearly
every
word
that
Deronda
had
said
about
Mirah
,
and
especially
that
phrase
,
which
she
repeated
to
herself
bitterly
,
having
an
ill
-
defined
consciousness
that
her
own
submission
was
something
very
different
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
been
obliged
to
allow
,
if
any
one
had
said
it
to
her
,
that
what
she
submitted
to
could
not
take
the
shape
of
duty
,
but
was
submission
to
a
yoke
drawn
on
her
by
an
action
she
was
ashamed
of
,
and
worn
with
a
strength
of
selfish
motives
that
left
no
weight
for
duty
to
carry
.
  
<EOS>
The
drawing
-
rooms
in
Park
Lane
,
all
white
,
gold
,
and
pale
crimson
,
were
agreeably
furnished
,
and
not
crowded
with
guests
,
before
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Grandcourt
entered
;
and
more
than
half
an
hour
of
instrumental
music
was
being
followed
by
an
interval
of
movement
and
chat
.
<EOS>
Klesmer
was
there
with
his
wife
,
and
in
his
generous
interest
for
Mirah
he
proposed
to
accompany
her
singing
of
Leo
's
"
_
O
patria
mia
_
,
"
<EOS>
which
he
had
before
recommended
her
to
choose
,
as
more
distinctive
of
her
than
better
known
music
.
<EOS>
He
was
already
at
the
piano
,
and
Mirah
was
standing
there
conspicuously
,
when
Gwendolen
,
magnificent
in
her
pale
green
velvet
and
poisoned
diamonds
,
was
ushered
to
a
seat
of
honor
well
in
view
of
them
.
<EOS>
With
her
long
sight
and
self
-
command
<EOS>
she
had
the
rare
power
of
quickly
distinguishing
persons
and
objects
on
entering
a
full
room
,
and
while
turning
her
glance
toward
Mirah
she
did
not
neglect
to
exchange
a
bow
with
Klesmer
as
she
passed
.
<EOS>
The
smile
seemed
to
each
a
lightning
-
flash
back
on
that
morning
when
it
had
been
her
ambition
to
stand
as
the
"
little
Jewess
"
was
standing
,
and
survey
a
grand
audience
from
the
higher
rank
of
her
talent
 
instead
of
which
she
was
one
of
the
ordinary
crowd
in
silk
and
gems
,
whose
utmost
performance
it
must
be
to
admire
or
find
fault
.
"
<EOS>
He
thinks
I
am
in
the
right
road
now
,
"
said
the
lurking
resentment
within
her
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
had
not
caught
sight
of
Deronda
in
her
passage
,
and
while
she
was
seated
acquitting
herself
in
chat
with
Sir
Hugo
,
she
glanced
round
her
with
careful
ease
,
bowing
a
recognition
here
and
there
,
and
fearful
lest
an
anxious
-
looking
exploration
in
search
of
Deronda
might
be
observed
by
her
husband
,
and
afterward
rebuked
as
something
"
damnably
vulgar
.
<EOS>
"
But
all
traveling
,
even
that
of
a
slow
gradual
glance
round
a
room
,
brings
a
liability
to
undesired
encounters
,
and
amongst
the
eyes
that
met
Gwendolen
's
,
forcing
her
into
a
slight
bow
,
were
those
of
the
"
amateur
too
fond
of
Meyerbeer
,
"
Mr.
Lush
,
whom
Sir
Hugo
continued
to
find
useful
as
a
half
-
caste
among
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
He
was
standing
near
her
husband
,
who
,
however
,
turned
a
shoulder
toward
him
,
and
was
being
understood
to
listen
to
Lord
Pentreath
.
<EOS>
How
was
it
that
at
this
moment
,
for
the
first
time
,
there
darted
through
Gwendolen
,
like
a
disagreeable
sensation
,
the
idea
that
this
man
knew
all
about
her
husband
's
life
?
<EOS>
He
had
been
banished
from
her
sight
,
according
to
her
will
,
and
she
had
been
satisfied
;
he
had
sunk
entirely
into
the
background
of
her
thoughts
,
screened
away
from
her
by
the
agitating
figures
that
kept
up
an
inward
drama
in
which
Lush
had
no
place
.
<EOS>
Here
suddenly
he
reappeared
at
her
husband
's
elbow
,
and
there
sprang
up
in
her
,
like
an
instantaneously
fabricated
memory
in
a
dream
,
the
sense
of
his
being
connected
with
the
secrets
that
made
her
wretched
.
<EOS>
She
was
conscious
of
effort
in
turning
her
head
away
from
him
,
trying
to
continue
her
wandering
survey
as
if
she
had
seen
nothing
of
more
consequence
than
the
picture
on
the
wall
,
till
she
discovered
Deronda
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
not
looking
toward
her
,
and
she
withdrew
her
eyes
from
him
,
without
having
got
any
recognition
,
consoling
herself
with
the
assurance
that
he
must
have
seen
her
come
in
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
he
was
not
standing
far
from
the
door
with
Hans
Meyrick
,
whom
he
had
been
careful
to
bring
into
Lady
Mallinger
's
list
.
<EOS>
They
were
both
a
little
more
anxious
than
was
comfortable
lest
Mirah
should
not
be
heard
to
advantage
.
<EOS>
Deronda
even
felt
himself
on
the
brink
of
betraying
emotion
,
Mirah
's
presence
now
being
linked
with
crowding
images
of
what
had
gone
before
and
was
to
come
after
 
all
centering
in
the
brother
<EOS>
he
was
soon
to
reveal
to
her
;
and
he
had
escaped
as
soon
as
he
could
from
the
side
of
Lady
Pentreath
,
who
had
said
in
her
violoncello
voice
    
"
<EOS>
Well
,
your
Jewess
is
pretty
 
<EOS>
there
's
no
denying
that
.
<EOS>
But
where
is
her
Jewish
impudence
?
<EOS>
She
looks
as
demure
as
a
nun
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
she
learned
that
on
the
stage
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
beginning
to
feel
on
Mirah
's
behalf
something
of
what
he
had
felt
for
himself
in
his
seraphic
boyish
time
,
when
Sir
Hugo
asked
him
if
he
would
like
to
be
a
great
singer
 
<EOS>
an
indignant
dislike
to
her
being
remarked
on
in
a
free
and
easy
way
,
as
if
she
were
an
imported
commodity
disdainfully
paid
for
by
the
fashionable
public
,
and
he
winced
the
more
because
Mordecai
,
he
knew
,
would
feel
that
the
name
"
Jewess
"
was
taken
as
a
sort
of
stamp
like
the
lettering
of
Chinese
silk
.
<EOS>
In
this
susceptible
mood
he
saw
the
Grandcourts
enter
,
and
was
immediately
appealed
to
by
Hans
about
"
that
Vandyke
duchess
of
a
beauty
.
"
<EOS>
Pray
excuse
Deronda
that
in
this
moment
he
felt
a
transient
renewal
of
his
first
repulsion
from
Gwendolen
,
as
if
she
and
her
beauty
and
her
failings
were
to
blame
for
the
undervaluing
of
Mirah
as
a
woman
 
a
feeling
something
like
class
animosity
,
which
affection
for
what
is
not
fully
recognized
by
others
,
whether
in
persons
or
in
poetry
,
rarely
allows
us
to
escape
.
<EOS>
To
Hans
admiring
Gwendolen
with
his
habitual
hyperbole
,
he
answered
,
with
a
sarcasm
that
was
not
quite
good
-
natured
    
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
could
admire
no
style
of
woman
but
your
Berenice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
the
style
I
worship
 
not
admire
,
"
said
Hans
.
<EOS>
"
Other
styles
of
women
I
might
make
myself
wicked
for
,
but
for
Berenice
I
could
make
myself
 
well
,
pretty
good
,
which
is
something
much
more
difficult
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
"
said
Deronda
,
under
the
pretext
that
the
singing
was
going
to
begin
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
so
delighted
with
the
answer
as
might
have
been
expected
,
and
was
relieved
by
Hans
's
movement
to
a
more
advanced
spot
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
had
never
before
heard
Mirah
sing
"
_
O
patria
mia
_
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
knew
well
Leopardi
's
fine
Ode
to
Italy
(
when
Italy
sat
like
a
disconsolate
mother
in
chains
,
hiding
her
face
on
her
knees
and
weeping
)
,
and
the
few
selected
words
were
filled
for
him
with
the
grandeur
of
the
whole
,
which
seemed
to
breath
an
inspiration
through
the
music
.
<EOS>
Mirah
singing
this
,
made
Mordecai
more
than
ever
one
presence
with
her
.
<EOS>
Certain
words
not
included
in
the
song
nevertheless
rang
within
Deronda
as
harmonies
from
the
invisible
            
"
Non
ti
difende
  
Nessun
dè
tuoi
!
<EOS>
L'armi
,
qua
l'armi
:
<EOS>
io
solo
  
<EOS>
Combatteró
,
procomberó
sol
io
"
  
<EOS>
[
Footnote
:
Do
none
of
thy
children
defend
thee
?
<EOS>
Arms
!
<EOS>
bring
me
arms
!
<EOS>
alone
I
will
fight
,
alone
I
will
fall
.
]
  
<EOS>
they
seemed
the
very
voice
of
that
heroic
passion
which
is
falsely
said
to
devote
itself
in
vain
when
it
achieves
the
god
-
like
end
of
manifesting
unselfish
love
.
<EOS>
And
that
passion
was
present
to
Deronda
now
as
the
vivid
image
of
a
man
dying
helplessly
away
from
the
possibility
of
battle
.
  
<EOS>
Mirah
was
equal
to
his
wishes
.
<EOS>
While
the
general
applause
was
sounding
,
Klesmer
gave
a
more
valued
testimony
,
audible
to
her
<EOS>
only
 
"
Good
,
good
 
the
crescendo
better
than
before
.
<EOS>
"
But
her
chief
anxiety
was
to
know
that
she
had
satisfied
Mr.
Deronda
:
<EOS>
any
failure
on
her
part
this
evening
would
have
pained
her
as
an
especial
injury
to
him
.
<EOS>
Of
course
all
her
prospects
were
due
to
what
he
had
done
for
her
;
still
,
this
occasion
of
singing
in
the
house
that
was
his
home
brought
a
peculiar
demand
.
<EOS>
She
looked
toward
him
in
the
distance
,
and
he
saw
that
she
did
;
but
he
remained
where
he
was
,
and
watched
the
streams
of
emulous
admirers
closing
round
her
,
till
presently
they
parted
to
make
way
for
Gwendolen
,
who
was
taken
up
to
be
introduced
by
Mrs.
Klesmer
.
<EOS>
Easier
now
about
"
the
little
Jewess
,
"
Daniel
relented
toward
poor
Gwendolen
in
her
splendor
,
and
his
memory
went
back
,
with
some
penitence
for
his
momentary
hardness
,
over
all
the
signs
and
confessions
that
she
too
needed
a
rescue
,
and
one
much
more
difficult
than
that
of
the
wanderer
by
the
river
 
a
rescue
for
which
he
felt
himself
helpless
.
<EOS>
The
silent
question
 
<EOS>
"
But
is
it
not
cowardly
to
make
that
a
reason
for
turning
away
?
"
was
the
form
in
which
he
framed
his
resolve
to
go
near
her
on
the
first
opportunity
,
and
show
his
regard
for
her
past
confidence
,
in
spite
of
Sir
Hugo
's
unwelcome
hints
.
  
<EOS>
Klesmer
,
having
risen
to
Gwendolen
as
she
approached
,
and
being
included
by
her
in
the
opening
conversation
with
Mirah
,
continued
near
them
a
little
while
,
looking
down
with
a
smile
,
which
was
rather
in
his
eyes
than
on
his
lips
,
at
the
piquant
contrast
of
the
two
charming
young
creatures
seated
on
the
red
divan
.
<EOS>
The
solicitude
seemed
to
be
all
on
the
side
of
the
splendid
one
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
let
me
say
how
much
I
am
obliged
to
you
,
"
said
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
heard
from
Mr.
Deronda
that
I
should
have
a
great
treat
in
your
singing
,
but
I
was
too
ignorant
to
imagine
how
great
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
good
to
say
so
,
"
answered
Mirah
,
her
mind
chiefly
occupied
in
contemplating
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
It
was
like
a
new
kind
of
stage
-
experience
to
her
to
be
close
to
genuine
grand
ladies
with
genuine
brilliants
and
complexions
,
and
they
impressed
her
vaguely
as
coming
out
of
some
unknown
drama
,
in
which
their
parts
perhaps
got
more
tragic
as
they
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
all
want
to
learn
of
you
 
<EOS>
I
,
at
least
,
"
said
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
I
sing
very
badly
,
as
Herr
Klesmer
will
tell
you
,
"
 
here
she
glanced
upward
to
that
higher
power
rather
archly
,
and
continued
 
"
<EOS>
but
I
have
been
rebuked
for
not
liking
to
middling
,
since
I
can
be
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
is
a
different
doctrine
from
yours
?
<EOS>
"
She
was
still
looking
at
Klesmer
,
who
said
quickly
    
"
Not
if
it
means
that
it
would
be
worth
while
for
you
to
study
further
,
and
for
Miss
Lapidoth
to
have
the
pleasure
of
helping
you
.
"
<EOS>
With
that
he
moved
away
,
and
Mirah
taking
everything
with
_
naïve
_
seriousness
,
said
    
"
If
you
think
I
could
teach
you
,
I
shall
be
very
glad
.
<EOS>
I
am
anxious
to
teach
,
but
I
have
only
just
begun
.
<EOS>
If
I
do
it
well
,
it
must
be
by
remembering
how
my
master
taught
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
was
in
reality
too
uncertain
about
herself
to
be
prepared
for
this
simple
promptitude
of
Mirah
's
,
and
in
her
wish
to
change
the
subject
,
said
,
with
some
lapse
from
the
good
taste
of
her
first
address
    
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
been
long
in
London
,
I
think
?
 
<EOS>
but
you
were
perhaps
introduced
to
Mr.
Deronda
abroad
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mirah
;
"
I
never
saw
him
before
I
came
to
England
in
the
summer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
has
seen
you
often
and
heard
you
sing
a
great
deal
,
has
he
not
?
"
said
Gwendolen
,
led
on
partly
by
the
wish
to
hear
anything
about
Deronda
,
and
partly
by
the
awkwardness
which
besets
the
readiest
person
,
in
carrying
on
a
dialogue
when
empty
of
matter
.
"
<EOS>
He
spoke
of
you
to
me
with
the
highest
praise
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
know
you
quite
well
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
was
poor
and
needed
help
,
"
said
Mirah
,
in
a
new
tone
of
feeling
,
"
and
Mr.
Deronda
has
given
me
the
best
friends
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
That
is
the
only
way
he
came
to
know
anything
about
me
 
because
he
was
sorry
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
no
friends
when
I
came
.
<EOS>
I
was
in
distress
.
<EOS>
I
owe
everything
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Gwendolen
,
who
had
wanted
to
be
a
struggling
artist
herself
,
could
nevertheless
not
escape
the
impression
that
a
mode
of
inquiry
which
would
have
been
rather
rude
toward
herself
was
an
amiable
condescension
to
this
Jewess
who
was
ready
to
give
her
lessons
.
<EOS>
The
only
effect
on
Mirah
,
as
always
on
any
mention
of
Deronda
,
was
to
stir
reverential
gratitude
and
anxiety
that
she
should
be
understood
to
have
the
deepest
obligation
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
But
both
he
and
Hans
,
who
were
noticing
the
pair
from
a
distance
,
would
have
felt
rather
indignant
if
they
had
known
that
the
conversation
had
led
up
to
Mirah
's
representation
of
herself
in
this
light
of
neediness
.
<EOS>
In
the
movement
that
prompted
her
,
however
,
there
was
an
exquisite
delicacy
,
which
perhaps
she
could
not
have
stated
explicitly
 
the
feeling
that
she
ought
not
to
allow
any
one
to
assume
in
Deronda
a
relation
of
more
equality
or
less
generous
interest
toward
her
than
actually
existed
.
<EOS>
Her
answer
was
delightful
to
Gwendolen
:
she
thought
of
nothing
but
the
ready
compassion
which
in
another
form
she
had
trusted
in
and
found
herself
;
and
on
the
signals
that
Klesmer
was
about
to
play
she
moved
away
in
much
content
,
entirely
without
presentiment
that
this
Jewish
_
protégé
_
would
ever
make
a
more
important
difference
in
her
life
than
the
possible
improvement
of
her
singing
 
if
the
leisure
and
spirits
of
a
Mrs.
Grandcourt
would
allow
of
other
lessons
than
such
as
the
world
was
giving
her
at
rather
a
high
charge
.
  
<EOS>
With
her
wonted
alternation
from
resolute
care
of
appearances
to
some
rash
indulgence
of
an
impulse
,
she
chose
,
under
the
pretext
of
getting
farther
from
the
instrument
,
not
to
go
again
to
her
former
seat
,
but
placed
herself
on
a
settee
where
she
could
only
have
one
neighbor
.
<EOS>
She
was
nearer
to
Deronda
than
before
:
was
it
surprising
that
he
came
up
in
time
to
shake
hands
before
the
music
began
 
then
,
that
after
he
had
stood
<EOS>
a
little
while
by
the
elbow
of
the
settee
at
the
empty
end
,
the
torrent
-
like
confluences
of
bass
and
treble
seemed
,
like
a
convulsion
of
nature
,
to
cast
the
conduct
of
petty
mortals
into
insignificance
,
and
to
warrant
his
sitting
down
?
  
<EOS>
But
when
at
the
end
of
Klesmer
's
playing
there
came
the
outburst
of
talk
under
which
Gwendolen
had
hoped
to
speak
as
she
would
to
Deronda
,
she
observed
that
Mr.
Lush
was
within
hearing
,
leaning
against
the
wall
close
by
them
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
help
her
flush
of
anger
,
but
she
tried
to
have
only
an
air
of
polite
indifference
in
saying
    
"
Miss
Lapidoth
is
everything
you
described
her
to
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
very
quick
in
discovering
that
,
"
said
Deronda
,
ironically
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
found
out
all
the
excellencies
you
spoke
of
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mean
that
,
"
said
Gwendolen
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
think
her
singing
is
charming
,
and
herself
,
too
.
<EOS>
Her
face
is
lovely
 
not
in
the
least
common
;
and
she
is
such
a
complete
little
person
.
<EOS>
I
should
think
she
will
be
a
great
success
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
speech
was
grating
on
Deronda
,
and
he
would
not
answer
it
,
but
looked
gravely
before
him
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
he
was
displeased
with
her
,
and
she
was
getting
so
impatient
under
the
neighborhood
of
Mr.
Lush
,
which
prevented
her
from
saying
any
word
she
wanted
to
say
,
that
she
meditated
some
desperate
step
to
get
rid
of
it
,
and
remained
silent
,
too
.
<EOS>
That
constraint
seemed
to
last
a
long
while
,
neither
Gwendolen
nor
Deronda
looking
at
the
other
,
till
Lush
slowly
relieved
the
wall
of
his
weight
,
and
joined
some
one
at
a
distance
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
immediately
said
,
"
You
despise
me
for
talking
artificially
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Deronda
,
looking
at
her
coolly
;
"
I
think
that
is
quite
excusable
sometimes
.
<EOS>
But
I
did
not
think
what
you
were
last
saying
was
altogether
artificial
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
was
something
in
it
that
displeased
you
,
"
said
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
What
was
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
impossible
to
explain
such
things
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
One
can
never
communicate
niceties
of
feeling
about
words
and
manner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
I
am
shut
out
from
understanding
them
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
with
a
slight
tremor
in
her
voice
,
which
she
was
trying
to
conquer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
I
shown
myself
so
very
dense
to
everything
you
have
said
?
<EOS>
"
There
was
an
indescribable
look
of
suppressed
tears
in
her
eyes
,
which
were
turned
on
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
"
said
Deronda
,
with
some
softening
of
voice
.
"
<EOS>
But
experience
differs
for
different
people
.
<EOS>
We
do
n't
all
wince
at
the
same
things
.
<EOS>
I
have
had
plenty
of
proof
that
you
are
not
dense
.
"
<EOS>
He
smiled
at
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
one
may
feel
things
and
are
not
able
to
do
anything
better
for
all
that
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
not
smiling
in
return
 
the
distance
to
which
Deronda
's
words
seemed
to
throw
her
chilling
her
too
much
.
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
think
we
can
only
get
better
by
having
people
about
us
who
raise
good
feelings
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
be
surprised
at
anything
in
me
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
is
too
late
for
me
to
alter
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
to
set
about
being
wise
,
as
you
told
me
to
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
seldom
find
I
do
any
good
by
my
preaching
.
<EOS>
I
might
as
well
have
kept
from
meddling
,
"
said
Deronda
,
thinking
rather
sadly
that
his
interference
about
that
unfortunate
necklace
might
end
in
nothing
but
an
added
pain
to
him
in
seeing
her
after
all
hardened
to
another
sort
of
gambling
than
roulette
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
say
that
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
hurriedly
,
feeling
that
this
might
be
her
only
chance
of
getting
the
words
uttered
,
and
dreading
the
increase
of
her
own
agitation
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
despair
of
me
,
I
shall
despair
.
<EOS>
Your
saying
that
I
should
not
go
on
being
selfish
and
ignorant
has
been
some
strength
to
me
.
<EOS>
If
you
say
you
wish
you
had
not
meddled
 
that
means
you
despair
of
me
and
forsake
me
.
<EOS>
And
then
you
will
decide
for
me
that
I
shall
not
be
good
.
<EOS>
It
is
you
who
will
decide
;
because
you
might
have
made
me
different
by
keeping
as
near
to
me
as
you
could
,
and
believing
in
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
had
not
been
looking
at
him
as
she
spoke
,
but
at
the
handle
of
the
fan
which
she
held
closed
.
<EOS>
With
the
last
words
she
rose
and
left
him
,
returning
to
her
former
place
,
which
had
been
left
vacant
;
while
every
one
was
settling
into
quietude
in
expectation
of
Mirah
's
voice
,
which
presently
,
with
that
wonderful
,
searching
quality
of
subdued
song
in
which
the
melody
seems
simply
an
effect
of
the
emotion
,
gave
forth
,
_
<EOS>
Per
pietà
non
dirmi
addio
_
.
  
<EOS>
In
Deronda
's
ear
the
strain
was
for
the
moment
a
continuance
of
Gwendolen
's
pleading
 
a
painful
urging
of
something
vague
and
difficult
,
irreconcilable
with
pressing
conditions
,
and
yet
cruel
to
resist
.
<EOS>
However
strange
the
mixture
in
her
of
a
resolute
pride
and
a
precocious
air
of
knowing
the
world
,
with
a
precipitate
,
guileless
indiscretion
,
he
was
quite
sure
now
that
the
mixture
existed
.
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
's
hints
had
made
him
alive
to
dangers
that
his
own
disposition
might
have
neglected
;
but
that
Gwendolen
's
reliance
on
him
was
unvisited
by
any
dream
of
his
being
a
man
who
could
misinterpret
her
was
as
manifest
as
morning
,
and
made
an
appeal
which
wrestled
with
his
sense
of
present
dangers
,
and
with
his
foreboding
of
a
growing
incompatible
claim
on
him
in
her
mind
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
foreshadowing
of
some
painful
collision
:
on
the
one
side
the
grasp
of
Mordecai
's
dying
hand
on
him
,
with
all
the
ideals
and
prospects
it
aroused
;
on
the
other
the
fair
creature
in
silk
and
gems
,
with
her
hidden
wound
and
her
self
-
dread
,
making
a
trustful
effort
to
lean
and
find
herself
sustained
.
<EOS>
It
was
as
if
he
had
a
vision
of
himself
besought
with
outstretched
arms
and
cries
,
while
he
was
caught
by
the
waves
and
compelled
to
mount
the
vessel
bound
for
a
far
-
off
coast
.
<EOS>
That
was
the
strain
of
excited
feeling
in
him
that
went
along
with
the
notes
of
Mirah
's
song
;
but
when
it
ceased
he
moved
from
his
seat
with
the
reflection
that
he
had
been
falling
into
an
exaggeration
of
his
own
importance
,
and
a
ridiculous
readiness
to
accept
Gwendolen
's
view
of
himself
,
as
if
he
could
really
have
any
decisive
power
over
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
an
enviable
fellow
you
are
,
"
said
Hans
to
him
,
"
sitting
on
a
sofa
with
that
young
duchess
,
and
having
an
interesting
quarrel
with
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quarrel
with
her
?
"
<EOS>
repeated
Deronda
,
rather
uncomfortably
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
about
theology
,
of
course
;
nothing
personal
.
<EOS>
But
she
told
you
what
you
ought
to
think
,
and
then
left
you
with
a
grand
air
which
was
admirable
.
<EOS>
Is
she
an
Antinomian
 
<EOS>
if
so
,
tell
her
I
am
an
Antinomian
painter
,
and
introduce
me
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
paint
her
and
her
husband
.
<EOS>
He
has
the
sort
of
handsome
_
physique
_
that
the
Duke
ought
to
have
in
_
Lucrezia
Borgia
<EOS>
_
 
if
it
could
go
with
a
fine
baritone
,
which
it
ca
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
devoutly
hoped
that
Hans
's
account
of
the
impression
his
dialogue
with
Gwendolen
had
made
on
a
distant
beholder
was
no
more
than
a
bit
of
fantastic
representation
,
such
as
was
common
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
And
Gwendolen
was
not
without
her
after
-
thoughts
that
her
husband
's
eyes
might
have
been
on
her
,
extracting
something
to
reprove
 
some
offence
against
her
dignity
as
his
wife
;
her
consciousness
telling
her
that
she
had
not
kept
up
the
perfect
air
of
equability
in
public
which
was
her
own
ideal
.
<EOS>
But
Grandcourt
made
no
observation
on
her
behavior
.
<EOS>
All
he
said
as
they
were
driving
home
was
    
"
Lush
will
dine
with
us
among
the
other
people
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
You
will
treat
him
civilly
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
heart
began
to
beat
violently
.
<EOS>
The
words
that
she
wanted
to
utter
,
as
one
wants
to
return
a
blow
,
were
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
breaking
your
promise
to
me
 
the
first
promise
you
made
me
.
"
<EOS>
But
she
dared
not
utter
them
.
<EOS>
She
was
as
frightened
at
a
quarrel
as
if
she
had
foreseen
that
it
would
end
with
throttling
fingers
on
her
neck
.
<EOS>
After
a
pause
,
she
said
in
the
tone
rather
of
defeat
than
resentment
    
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
did
not
intend
him
to
frequent
the
house
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
him
just
now
.
<EOS>
He
is
useful
to
me
;
and
he
must
be
treated
civilly
.
"
  
<EOS>
Silence
.
<EOS>
There
may
come
a
moment
when
even
an
excellent
husband
who
has
dropped
smoking
under
more
or
less
of
a
pledge
during
courtship
,
for
the
first
time
will
introduce
his
cigar
-
smoke
between
himself
and
his
wife
,
with
the
tacit
understanding
that
she
will
have
to
put
up
with
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Lush
was
,
so
to
speak
,
a
very
large
cigar
.
  
<EOS>
If
these
are
the
sort
of
lovers
'
vows
at
which
Jove
laughs
,
he
must
have
a
merry
time
of
it
.
        
<EOS>
"
If
any
one
should
importune
me
to
give
a
reason
why
I
loved
him
,
I
    
feel
it
could
no
otherwise
be
expressed
than
by
making
answer
,
    
"
Because
it
was
he
,
because
it
was
I.
<EOS>

There
is
,
beyond
what
I

able
    
to

inexplicable

<EOS>
The
time
had
come
to
prepare
Mordecai
for
the
revelation
of
the
restored
sister
and
for
the
change
of
abode
which
was
desirable
before
Mirah
's
meeting
with
her
brother
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
to
whom
Deronda
had
confided
everything
except
Mordecai
's
peculiar
relation
to
himself
,
had
been
active
in
helping
him
to
find
a
suitable
lodging
in
Brompton
,
not
many
minutes
'
walk
from
her
own
house
,
so
that
the
brother
and
sister
would
be
within
reach
of
her
motherly
care
.
<EOS>
Her
happy
mixture
of
Scottish
fervor
and
Gallic
liveliness
had
enabled
her
to
keep
the
secret
close
from
the
girls
as
well
as
from
Hans
,
any
betrayal
to
them
being
likely
to
reach
Mirah
in
some
way
that
would
raise
an
agitating
suspicion
,
and
spoil
the
important
opening
of
that
work
which
was
to
secure
her
independence
,
as
we
rather
arbitrarily
call
one
of
the
more
arduous
and
dignified
forms
of
our
dependence
.
<EOS>
And
both
Mrs.
Meyrick
and
Deronda
had
more
reasons
than
they
could
have
expressed
for
desiring
that
Mirah
should
be
able
to
maintain
herself
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
"
the
little
mother
"
was
rather
helped
in
her
secrecy
by
some
dubiousness
in
her
sentiment
about
the
remarkable
brother
described
to
her
;
and
certainly
if
she
felt
any
joy
and
anticipatory
admiration
,
it
was
due
to
her
faith
in
Deronda
's
judgment
.
<EOS>
The
consumption
was
a
sorrowful
fact
that
appealed
to
her
tenderness
;
but
how
was
she
to
be
very
glad
of
an
enthusiasm
which
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
she
could
only
contemplate
as
Jewish
pertinacity
,
and
as
rather
an
undesirable
introduction
among
them
all
of
a
man
whose
conversation
would
not
be
more
modern
and
encouraging
than
that
of
Scott
's
Covenanters
?
<EOS>
Her
mind
was
anything
but
prosaic
,
and
had
her
soberer
share
of
Mab
's
delight
in
the
romance
of
Mirah
's
story
and
of
her
abode
with
them
;
but
the
romantic
or
unusual
in
real
life
requires
some
adaptation
.
<EOS>
We
sit
up
at
night
to
read
about
Sakya
-
Mouni
,
St.
Francis
,
or
Oliver
Cromwell
;
but
whether
we
should
be
glad
for
any
one
at
all
like
them
to
call
on
us
the
next
morning
,
still
more
,
to
reveal
himself
as
a
new
relation
,
is
quite
another
affair
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
Mrs.
Meyrick
had
hoped
,
as
her
children
did
,
that
the
intensity
of
Mirah
's
feeling
about
Judaism
would
slowly
subside
,
and
be
merged
in
the
gradually
deepening
current
of
loving
interchange
with
her
new
friends
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
her
secret
favorite
continuation
of
the
romance
had
been
no
discovery
of
Jewish
relations
,
but
something
much
more
favorable
to
the
hopes
she
discerned
in
Hans
.
<EOS>
And
now
 
here
was
a
brother
who
would
dip
Mirah
's
mind
over
again
in
the
deepest
dye
of
Jewish
sentiment
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
help
saying
to
Deronda
    
<EOS>
"
I
am
as
glad
as
you
are
that
the
pawnbroker
is
not
her
brother
:
there
are
Ezras
and
Ezras
in
the
world
;
and
really
it
is
a
comfort
to
think
that
all
Jews
are
not
like
those
shopkeepers
who
_
<EOS>
will
not
_
let
you
get
out
of
their
shops
:
and
besides
,
what
he
said
to
you
about
his
mother
and
sister
<EOS>
makes
me
bless
him
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
he
's
good
.
<EOS>
But
I
never
did
like
anything
fanatical
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
heard
a
little
too
much
preaching
in
my
youth
and
lost
my
palate
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
you
will
find
that
Mordecai
obtrudes
any
preaching
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
not
what
I
should
call
fanatical
.
<EOS>
I
call
a
man
fanatical
when
his
enthusiasm
is
narrow
and
hoodwinked
,
so
that
he
has
no
sense
of
proportions
,
and
becomes
unjust
and
unsympathetic
to
men
who
are
out
of
his
own
track
.
<EOS>
Mordecai
is
an
enthusiast
;
I
should
like
to
keep
that
word
for
the
highest
order
of
minds
 
those
who
care
supremely
for
grand
and
general
benefits
to
mankind
.
<EOS>
He
is
not
a
strictly
orthodox
Jew
,
and
is
full
of
allowances
for
others
;
his
conformity
in
many
things
is
an
allowance
for
the
condition
of
other
Jews
.
<EOS>
The
people
he
lives
with
are
as
fond
of
him
as
possible
,
and
they
ca
n't
in
the
least
understand
his
ideas
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
well
,
I
can
live
up
to
the
level
of
the
pawnbroker
's
mother
,
and
like
him
for
what
I
see
to
be
good
in
him
;
and
for
what
I
do
n't
see
the
merits
of
I
will
take
your
word
.
<EOS>
According
to
your
definition
,
I
suppose
one
might
be
fanatical
in
worshipping
common
-
sense
;
for
my
poor
husband
used
to
say
the
world
would
be
a
poor
place
if
there
were
nothing
but
common
-
sense
in
it
.
<EOS>
However
,
Mirah
's
brother
will
have
good
bedding
 
<EOS>
that
I
have
taken
care
of
;
and
I
shall
have
this
extra
window
pasted
up
with
paper
to
prevent
draughts
.
"
<EOS>
(
The
conversation
was
taking
place
in
the
destined
lodging
.
)
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
comfort
to
think
that
the
people
of
the
house
are
no
strangers
to
me
 
no
hypocritical
harpies
.
<EOS>
And
when
the
children
know
,
we
shall
be
able
to
make
the
rooms
much
prettier
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
next
stage
of
the
affair
is
to
tell
all
to
Mordecai
,
and
get
him
to
move
 
<EOS>
which
may
be
a
more
difficult
business
,

said
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
will
you
tell
Mirah
before
I
say
anything
to
the
children
?

said
Mrs.
Meyrick
.
<EOS>
But
Deronda
hesitated
,
and
she
went
on
in
a
tone
of
persuasive
deliberation
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
think
not
.
<EOS>
Let
me
tell
Hans
and
the
girls
the
evening
before
,
and
they
will
be
away
the
next
morning
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
that
will
be
best
.
<EOS>
But
do
justice
to
my
account
of
Mordecai
 
or
Ezra
,
as
I
suppose
Mirah
will
wish
to
call
him
:
do
n't
assist
their
imagination
by
referring
to
Habakkuk
Mucklewrath
,
"
said
Deronda
,
smiling
 
Mrs.
Meyrick
herself
having
used
the
comparison
of
the
Covenanters
.
  
<EOS>
"
Trust
me
,
trust
me
,
"
said
the
little
mother
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
have
to
persuade
them
so
hard
to
be
glad
,
that
I
shall
convert
myself
.
<EOS>
When
I
am
frightened
I
find
it
a
good
thing
to
have
somebody
to
be
angry
with
for
not
being
brave
:
it
warms
the
blood
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
might
have
been
more
argumentative
or
persuasive
about
the
view
to
be
taken
of
Mirah
's
brother
,
if
he
had
been
less
anxiously
preoccupied
with
the
more
important
task
immediately
before
him
,
which
he
desired
to
acquit
himself
of
without
wounding
the
Cohens
.
<EOS>
Mordecai
,
by
a
memorable
answer
,
had
made
it
evident
that
he
would
be
keenly
alive
to
any
inadvertance
in
relation
to
their
feelings
.
<EOS>
In
the
interval
,
he
had
been
meeting
Mordecai
at
the
_
Hand
and
Banner
_
,
but
now
after
due
reflection
he
wrote
to
him
saying
that
he
had
particular
reasons
for
wishing
to
see
him
in
his
own
home
the
next
evening
,
and
would
beg
to
sit
with
him
in
his
workroom
for
an
hour
,
if
the
Cohens
would
not
regard
it
as
an
intrusion
.
<EOS>
He
would
call
with
the
understanding
that
if
there
were
any
objection
,
Mordecai
would
accompany
him
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
Deronda
hoped
in
this
way
to
create
a
little
expectation
that
would
have
a
preparatory
effect
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
received
with
the
usual
friendliness
,
some
additional
costume
in
the
women
and
children
,
and
in
all
the
elders
a
slight
air
of
wondering
which
even
in
Cohen
was
not
allowed
to
pass
the
bounds
of
silence
 
<EOS>
the
guest
's
transactions
with
Mordecai
being
a
sort
of
mystery
which
he
was
rather
proud
to
think
lay
outside
the
sphere
of
light
which
enclosed
his
own
understanding
.
<EOS>
But
when
Deronda
said
,
"
I
suppose
Mordecai
is
at
home
and
expecting
me
,
"
Jacob
,
who
had
profited
by
the
family
remarks
,
went
up
to
his
knee
and
said
,
"
What
do
you
want
to
talk
to
Mordecai
about
?
"
  
"
Something
that
is
very
interesting
to
him
,
"
said
Deronda
,
pinching
the
lad
's
ear
,
"
but
that
you
ca
n't
understand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
say
this
?
"
said
Jacob
,
immediately
giving
forth
a
string
of
his
rote
-
learned
Hebrew
verses
with
a
wonderful
mixture
of
the
throaty
and
the
nasal
,
and
nodding
his
small
head
at
his
hearer
,
with
a
sense
of
giving
formidable
evidence
which
might
rather
alter
their
mutual
position
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
really
,
"
said
Deronda
,
keeping
grave
;
"
I
ca
n't
say
anything
like
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
not
,
"
said
Jacob
,
performing
a
dance
of
triumph
with
his
small
scarlet
legs
,
while
he
took
various
objects
out
of
the
deep
pockets
of
his
knickerbockers
and
returned
them
thither
,
as
a
slight
hint
of
his
resources
;
after
which
,
running
to
the
door
of
the
workroom
,
he
opened
it
wide
,
set
his
back
against
it
,
and
said
,
"
Mordecai
,
here
's
the
young
swell
"
 
a
copying
of
his
father
's
phrase
,
which
seemed
to
him
well
fitted
to
cap
the
recitation
of
Hebrew
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
called
back
with
hushes
by
mother
and
grandmother
,
and
Deronda
,
entering
and
closing
the
door
behind
him
,
saw
that
a
bit
of
carpet
had
been
laid
down
,
a
chair
placed
,
and
the
fire
and
lights
attended
to
,
in
sign
of
the
Cohens
'
respect
.
<EOS>
As
Mordecai
rose
to
greet
him
,
Deronda
was
struck
with
the
air
of
solemn
expectation
in
his
face
,
such
as
would
have
seemed
perfectly
natural
if
his
letter
had
declared
that
some
revelation
was
to
be
made
about
the
lost
sister
.
<EOS>
Neither
of
them
spoke
,
till
Deronda
,
with
his
usual
tenderness
of
manner
,
had
drawn
the
vacant
chair
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
hearth
and
had
seated
himself
near
to
Mordecai
,
who
then
said
,
in
a
tone
of
fervid
certainty
    
<EOS>
"
You
are
coming
to
tell
me
something
that
my
soul
longs
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
true
I
have
something
very
weighty
to
tell
you
 
something
I
trust
that
you
will
rejoice
in
,
"
said
Deronda
,
on
his
guard
against
the
probability
that
Mordecai
had
been
preparing
himself
for
something
quite
different
from
the
fact
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
all
revealed
 
<EOS>
it
is
made
clear
to
you
,
"
said
Mordecai
,
more
eagerly
,
leaning
forward
with
clasped
hands
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
even
as
my
brother
that
sucked
the
breasts
of
my
mother
 
<EOS>
the
heritage
is
yours
 
there
is
no
doubt
to
divide
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
learned
nothing
new
about
myself
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
The
disappointment
was
inevitable
:
it
was
better
not
to
let
the
feeling
be
strained
longer
in
a
mistaken
hope
.
  
<EOS>
Mordecai
sank
back
in
his
chair
,
unable
for
the
moment
to
care
what
was
really
coming
.
<EOS>
The
whole
day
his
mind
had
been
in
a
state
of
tension
toward
one
fulfillment
.
<EOS>
The
reaction
was
sickening
and
he
closed
his
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Except
,
"
Deronda
went
on
gently
,
after
a
pause
,
 
"
except
that
I
had
really
some
time
ago
come
into
another
sort
of
hidden
connection
with
you
,
besides
what
you
have
spoken
of
as
existing
in
your
own
feeling
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
eyes
were
not
opened
,
but
there
was
a
fluttering
in
the
lids
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
one
in
whom
you
are
interested
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
One
who
is
closely
related
to
your
departed
mother
,
"
Deronda
went
on
wishing
to
make
the
disclosure
gradual
;
but
noticing
a
shrinking
movement
in
Mordecai
,
he
added
 
"
whom
she
and
you
held
dear
above
all
others
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mordecai
,
with
a
sudden
start
,
laid
a
spasmodic
grasp
on
Deronda
's
wrist
;
there
was
a
great
terror
in
him
.
<EOS>
And
Deronda
divined
it
.
<EOS>
A
tremor
was
perceptible
in
his
clear
tones
as
he
said
    
"
What
was
prayed
for
has
come
to
pass
:
Mirah
has
been
delivered
from
evil
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mordecai
's
grasp
relaxed
a
little
,
but
he
was
panting
with
a
tearless
sob
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
went
on
:
"
Your
sister
is
worthy
of
the
mother
you
honored
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
waited
there
,
and
Mordecai
,
throwing
himself
backward
in
his
chair
,
again
closed
his
eyes
,
uttering
himself
almost
inaudibly
for
some
minutes
in
Hebrew
,
and
then
subsiding
into
a
happy
-
looking
silence
.
<EOS>
Deronda
,
watching
the
expression
in
his
uplifted
face
,
could
have
imagined
that
he
was
speaking
with
some
beloved
object
:
there
was
a
new
suffused
sweetness
,
something
like
that
on
the
faces
of
the
beautiful
dead
.
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
Deronda
thought
he
discerned
a
family
resemblance
to
Mirah
.
  
<EOS>
Presently
when
Mordecai
was
ready
to
listen
,
the
rest
was
told
.
<EOS>
But
in
accounting
for
Mirah
's
flight
he
made
the
statement
about
the
father
's
conduct
as
vague
as
he
could
,
and
threw
the
emphasis
on
her
yearning
to
come
to
England
as
the
place
where
she
might
find
her
mother
.
<EOS>
Also
he
kept
back
the
fact
of
Mirah
's
intention
to
drown
herself
,
and
his
own
part
in
rescuing
her
;
merely
describing
the
home
she
had
found
with
friends
of
his
,
whose
interest
in
her
and
efforts
for
her
he
had
shared
.
<EOS>
What
he
dwelt
on
finally
was
Mirah
's
feeling
about
her
mother
and
brother
;
and
in
relation
to
this
he
tried
to
give
every
detail
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
in
search
of
them
,
"
said
Deronda
,
smiling
,
"
that
I
turned
into
this
house
:
<EOS>
the
name
Ezra
Cohen
was
just
then
the
most
interesting
name
in
the
world
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
confess
I
had
fear
for
a
long
while
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
will
forgive
me
now
for
having
asked
you
that
question
about
the
elder
Mrs.
Cohen
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
I
cared
very
much
what
I
should
find
Mirah
's
friends
to
be
.
<EOS>
But
I
had
found
a
brother
worthy
of
her
when
I
knew
that
her
Ezra
was
disguised
under
the
name
of
Mordecai
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mordecai
is
really
my
name
 
Ezra
Mordecai
Cohen
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Is
there
any
kinship
between
this
family
and
yours
?
"
said
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
the
kinship
of
Israel
.
<EOS>
My
soul
clings
to
these
people
,
who
have
sheltered
me
and
given
me
succor
out
of
the
affection
that
abides
in
Jewish
hearts
,
as
sweet
odor
in
things
long
crushed
and
hidden
from
the
outer
air
.
<EOS>
It
is
good
for
me
to
bear
with
their
ignorance
and
be
bound
to
them
in
gratitude
,
that
I
may
keep
in
mind
the
spiritual
poverty
of
the
Jewish
million
,
and
not
put
impatient
knowledge
in
the
stead
of
loving
wisdom
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
do
n't
feel
bound
to
continue
with
them
<EOS>
now
there
is
a
closer
tie
to
draw
you
?
"
said
Deronda
,
not
without
fear
that
he
might
find
an
obstacle
to
overcome
.
<EOS>
"
It
seems
to
me
right
now
 
is
it
not
?
 
<EOS>
that
you
should
live
with
your
sister
;
and
I
have
prepared
a
home
to
take
you
to
in
the
neighborhood
of
her
friends
,
that
she
may
join
you
there
.
<EOS>
Pray
grant
me
this
wish
.
<EOS>
It
will
enable
me
to
be
with
you
often
in
the
hours
when
Mirah
is
obliged
to
leave
you
.
<EOS>
That
is
my
selfish
reason
.
<EOS>
But
the
chief
reason
is
,
that
Mirah
will
desire
to
watch
over
you
,
and
that
you
ought
to
give
her
the
guardianship
of
a
brother
's
presence
.
<EOS>
You
shall
have
books
about
you
.
<EOS>
I
shall
want
to
learn
of
you
,
and
to
take
you
out
to
see
the
river
and
trees
.
<EOS>
And
you
will
have
the
rest
and
comfort
that
you
will
be
more
and
more
in
need
of
 
nay
,
that
I
need
for
you
.
<EOS>
This
is
the
claim
I
make
on
you
,
now
that
we
have
found
each
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
spoke
in
a
tone
of
earnest
,
affectionate
pleading
,
such
as
he
might
have
used
to
a
venerated
elder
brother
.
<EOS>
Mordecai
's
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
with
a
listening
contemplation
,
and
he
was
silent
for
a
little
while
after
Deronda
had
ceased
to
speak
.
<EOS>
Then
he
said
,
with
an
almost
reproachful
emphasis
    
<EOS>
"
And
you
would
have
me
hold
it
doubtful
whether
you
were
born
a
Jew
!
<EOS>
Have
we
not
from
the
first
touched
each
other
with
invisible
fibres
 
<EOS>
have
we
not
quivered
together
like
the
leaves
from
a
common
stem
with
stirring
from
a
common
root
?
<EOS>
I
know
what
I
am
outwardly
,
I
am
one
among
the
crowd
of
poor
 
<EOS>
I
am
stricken
,
I
am
dying
.
<EOS>
But
our
souls
know
each
other
.
<EOS>
They
gazed
in
silence
as
those
who
have
long
been
parted
and
meet
again
,
but
when
they
found
voice
they
were
assured
,
and
all
their
speech
is
understanding
.
<EOS>
The
life
of
Israel
is
in
your
veins
.
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
sat
perfectly
still
,
but
felt
his
face
tingling
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
either
to
deny
or
assent
.
<EOS>
He
waited
,
hoping
that
Mordecai
would
presently
give
him
a
more
direct
answer
.
<EOS>
And
after
a
pause
of
meditation
he
did
say
,
firmly
    
"
What
you
wish
of
me
I
will
do
.
<EOS>
And
our
mother
 
may
the
blessing
of
the
Eternal
be
with
her
in
our
souls
!
 
<EOS>
would
have
wished
it
too
.
<EOS>
I
will
accept
what
your
loving
kindness
has
prepared
,
and
Mirah
's
home
shall
be
mine
.
"
<EOS>
He
paused
a
moment
,
and
then
added
in
a
more
melancholy
tone
,
"
<EOS>
But
I
shall
grieve
to
part
from
these
parents
and
the
little
ones
.
<EOS>
You
must
tell
them
,
for
my
heart
would
fail
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
felt
that
you
would
want
me
to
tell
them
.
<EOS>
Shall
we
go
now
at
once
?
"
<EOS>
said
Deronda
,
much
relieved
by
this
unwavering
compliance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
let
us
not
defer
it
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
done
,
"
said
Mordecai
,
rising
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
has
to
perform
a
painful
duty
.
<EOS>
Then
came
,
as
an
afterthought
,
"
But
do
not
dwell
on
my
sister
more
than
is
needful
.
"
  
<EOS>
When
they
entered
the
parlor
he
said
to
the
alert
Jacob
,
"
Ask
your
father
to
come
,
and
tell
Sarah
to
mind
the
shop
.
<EOS>
My
friend
has
something
to
say
,
"
he
continued
,
turning
to
the
elder
Mrs.
Cohen
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
part
of
Mordecai
's
eccentricity
that
he
should
call
this
gentleman
his
friend
;
and
the
two
women
tried
to
show
their
better
manners
by
warm
politeness
in
begging
Deronda
to
seat
himself
in
the
best
place
.
  
<EOS>
When
Cohen
entered
with
a
pen
behind
his
ear
,
he
rubbed
his
hands
and
said
with
loud
satisfaction
,
"
Well
,
sir
!
<EOS>
I
'm
glad
you
're
doing
us
the
honor
to
join
our
family
party
again
.
<EOS>
We
are
pretty
comfortable
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
round
with
shiny
gladness
.
<EOS>
And
when
all
were
seated
on
the
hearth
the
scene
was
worth
peeping
in
upon
:
on
one
side
Baby
under
her
scarlet
quilt
in
the
corner
being
rocked
by
the
young
mother
,
and
Adelaide
Rebekah
seated
on
the
grandmother
's
knee
;
on
the
other
,
Jacob
between
his
father
's
legs
;
while
the
two
markedly
different
figures
of
Deronda
and
Mordecai
were
in
the
middle
 
Mordecai
a
little
backward
in
the
shade
,
anxious
to
conceal
his
agitated
susceptibility
to
what
was
going
on
around
him
.
<EOS>
The
chief
light
came
from
the
fire
,
which
brought
out
the
rich
color
on
a
depth
of
shadow
,
and
seemed
to
turn
into
speech
the
dark
gems
of
eyes
that
looked
at
each
other
kindly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
been
telling
Mordecai
of
an
event
that
makes
a
great
change
in
his
life
,
"
Deronda
began
,
"
but
I
hope
you
will
agree
with
me
that
it
is
a
joyful
one
.
<EOS>
Since
he
thinks
of
you
as
his
best
friends
,
he
wishes
me
to
tell
you
for
him
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Relations
with
money
,
sir
?
"
burst
in
Cohen
,
feeling
a
power
of
divination
which
it
was
a
pity
to
nullify
by
waiting
for
the
fact
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
not
exactly
,
"
said
Deronda
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"
But
a
very
precious
relation
wishes
to
be
reunited
to
him
 
a
very
good
and
lovely
young
sister
,
who
will
care
for
his
comfort
in
every
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Married
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
not
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
with
a
maintenance
?
"
  
"
With
talents
which
will
secure
her
a
maintenance
.
<EOS>
A
home
is
already
provided
for
Mordecai
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
silence
for
a
moment
or
two
before
the
grandmother
said
in
a
wailing
tone
    
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
well
!
<EOS>
and
so
you
're
going
away
from
us
,
Mordecai
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
where
there
's
no
children
as
there
is
here
,
"
said
the
mother
,
catching
the
wail
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
Jacob
,
and
no
Adelaide
,
and
no
Eugenie
!
"
wailed
the
grandmother
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
Jacob
's
learning
'
<EOS>
ill
all
wear
out
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
must
go
to
school
.
<EOS>
It
'll
be
hard
times
for
Jacob
,
"
said
Cohen
,
in
a
tone
of
decision
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
wide
-
open
ears
of
Jacob
his
father
's
words
sounded
like
a
doom
,
giving
an
awful
finish
to
the
dirge
-
like
effect
of
the
whole
announcement
.
<EOS>
His
face
had
been
gathering
a
wondering
incredulous
sorrow
at
the
notion
of
Mordecai
's
going
away
:
he
was
unable
to
imagine
the
change
as
anything
lasting
;
but
at
the
mention
of
"
hard
times
for
Jacob
"
there
was
no
further
suspense
of
feeling
,
and
he
broke
forth
in
loud
lamentation
.
<EOS>
Adelaide
Rebekah
always
cried
when
her
brother
cried
,
and
now
began
to
howl
with
astonishing
suddenness
,
whereupon
baby
awaking
contributed
angry
screams
,
and
required
to
be
taken
out
of
the
cradle
.
<EOS>
A
great
deal
of
hushing
was
necessary
,
and
Mordecai
feeling
the
cries
pierce
him
,
put
out
his
arms
to
Jacob
,
who
in
the
midst
of
his
tears
and
sobs
was
turning
his
head
right
and
left
for
general
observation
.
<EOS>
His
father
,
who
had
been
 
saying
,
"
Never
mind
,
old
man
;
you
shall
go
to
the
riders
,
"
now
released
him
,
and
he
went
to
Mordecai
,
who
clasped
him
,
and
laid
his
cheek
on
the
little
black
head
without
speaking
.
<EOS>
But
Cohen
,
sensible
that
the
master
of
the
family
must
make
some
apology
for
all
this
weakness
,
and
that
the
occasion
called
for
a
speech
,
addressed
Deronda
with
some
elevation
of
pitch
,
squaring
his
elbows
and
resting
a
hand
on
each
knee
:
    
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
as
we
're
the
people
to
grudge
anybody
's
good
luck
,
sir
,
or
the
portion
of
their
cup
being
made
fuller
,
as
I
may
say
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
an
envious
man
,
and
if
anybody
offered
to
set
up
Mordecai
in
a
shop
of
my
sort
two
doors
lower
down
,
_
I
_
should
n't
make
wry
faces
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
one
of
them
that
had
need
have
a
poor
opinion
of
themselves
,
and
be
frightened
at
anybody
else
getting
a
chance
.
<EOS>
If
I
'm
offal
,
let
a
wise
man
come
and
tell
me
,
for
I
've
never
heard
it
yet
.
<EOS>
And
in
point
of
business
,
I
'm
not
a
class
of
goods
to
be
in
danger
.
<EOS>
If
anybody
takes
to
rolling
me
,
I
can
pack
myself
up
like
a
caterpillar
,
and
find
my
feet
when
I
'm
let
alone
.
<EOS>
And
though
,
as
I
may
say
,
you
're
taking
some
of
our
good
works
from
us
,
which
is
property
bearing
interest
<EOS>
,
I
'm
not
saying
<EOS>
but
we
can
afford
that
,
though
my
mother
and
my
wife
had
the
good
will
to
wish
and
do
for
Mordecai
to
the
last
;
and
a
Jew
must
not
be
like
a
servant
who
works
for
reward
 
though
I
see
nothing
against
a
reward
if
I
can
get
it
.
<EOS>
And
as
to
the
extra
outlay
in
schooling
,
I
'm
neither
poor
nor
greedy
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
hang
myself
for
sixpence
,
nor
half
a
crown
neither
.
<EOS>
But
the
truth
of
it
is
,
the
women
and
children
are
fond
of
Mordecai
.
<EOS>
You
may
partly
see
how
it
is
,
sir
,
by
your
own
sense
.
<EOS>
A
Jewish
man
is
bound
to
thank
God
,
day
by
day
,
that
he
was
not
made
a
woman
;
but
a
woman
has
to
thank
God
that
He
has
made
her
according
to
His
will
.
<EOS>
And
we
all
know
what
He
has
made
her
 
a
child
-
bearing
,
tender
-
hearted
thing
is
the
woman
of
our
people
.
<EOS>
Her
children
are
mostly
stout
,
as
I
think
you
'll
say
Addy
's
are
,
and
she
's
not
mushy
,
but
her
heart
is
tender
.
<EOS>
So
you
must
excuse
present
company
,
sir
,
for
not
being
glad
all
at
once
.
<EOS>
And
as
to
this
young
lady
 
for
by
what
you
say
"
young
lady
"
is
the
proper
term
"
 
Cohen
here
threw
some
additional
emphasis
into
his
look
and
tone
 
<EOS>
"
we
shall
all
be
glad
for
Mordecai
's
sake
by
-
and
-
by
,
when
we
cast
up
our
accounts
and
see
where
we
are
.
"
  
<EOS>
Before
Deronda
could
summon
any
answer
to
this
oddly
mixed
speech
,
Mordecai
exclaimed
    
"
Friends
,
friends
!
<EOS>
For
food
and
raiment
and
shelter
I
would
not
have
sought
better
than
you
have
given
me
.
<EOS>
You
have
sweetened
the
morsel
with
love
;
and
what
I
thought
of
as
a
joy
that
would
be
left
to
me
even
in
the
last
months
of
my
waning
strength
was
to
go
on
teaching
the
lad
.
<EOS>
But
now
I
am
as
one
who
had
clad
himself
beforehand
in
his
shroud
,
and
used
himself
to
making
the
grave
his
bed
,
when
the
divine
command
sounded
in
his
ears
,
"
Arise
,
and
go
forth
;
the
night
is
not
yet
come
.
<EOS>
"
For
no
light
matter
would
I
have
turned
away
from
your
kindness
to
take
another
's
.
<EOS>
But
it
has
been
taught
us
,
as
you
know
,
that
_
the
reward
of
one
duty
is
the
power
to
fulfill
another
_
 
<EOS>
so
said
Ben
Azai
.
<EOS>
You
have
made
your
duty
to
one
of
the
poor
among
your
brethren
a
joy
to
you
and
me
;
and
your
reward
shall
be
that
you
will
not
rest
without
the
joy
of
like
deeds
in
the
time
to
come
.
<EOS>
And
may
not
Jacob
come
and
visit
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mordecai
had
turned
with
this
question
to
Deronda
,
who
said
    
"
Surely
that
can
be
managed
.
<EOS>
It
is
no
further
than
Brompton
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jacob
,
who
had
been
gradually
calmed
by
the
need
to
hear
what
was
going
forward
,
began
now
to
see
some
daylight
on
the
future
,
the
word
"
visit
"
having
the
lively
charm
of
cakes
and
general
relaxation
at
his
grandfather
's
,
the
dealer
in
knives
.
<EOS>
He
danced
away
from
Mordecai
,
and
took
up
a
station
of
survey
in
the
middle
of
the
hearth
with
his
hands
in
his
knickerbockers
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
the
grandmother
,
with
a
sigh
of
resignation
,
"
<EOS>
I
hope
there
'll
be
nothing
in
the
way
of
your
getting
_
kosher
_
meat
,
Mordecai
.
<EOS>
For
you
'll
have
to
trust
to
those
you
live
with
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
right
<EOS>
,
that
's
all
right
<EOS>
,
you
may
be
sure
,
mother
,
"
said
Cohen
,
as
if
anxious
to
cut
off
inquiry
on
matters
in
which
he
was
uncertain
of
the
guest
's
position
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
,
sir
,
"
he
added
,
turning
with
a
look
of
amused
enlightenment
to
Deronda
,
"
it
was
better
than
learning
you
had
to
talk
to
Mordecai
about
!
<EOS>
I
wondered
to
myself
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
I
thought
somehow
there
was
a
something
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mordecai
will
perhaps
explain
to
you
how
it
was
that
I
was
seeking
him
,
"
said
Deronda
,
feeling
that
he
had
better
go
,
and
rising
as
he
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
agreed
that
he
should
come
again
and
the
final
move
be
made
on
the
next
day
but
one
;
but
when
he
was
going
Mordecai
begged
to
walk
with
him
to
the
end
of
the
street
,
and
wrapped
himself
in
coat
and
comforter
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
March
evening
,
and
Deronda
did
not
mean
to
let
him
go
far
,
but
he
understood
the
wish
to
be
outside
the
house
with
him
in
communicative
silence
,
after
the
exciting
speech
that
had
been
filling
the
last
hour
.
<EOS>
No
word
was
spoken
until
Deronda
had
proposed
parting
,
when
he
said
    
"
Mirah
would
wish
to
thank
the
Cohens
for
their
goodness
.
<EOS>
You
would
wish
her
to
do
so
 
to
come
and
see
them
,
would
you
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mordecai
did
not
answer
immediately
,
but
at
length
said
    
"
I
can
not
tell
.
<EOS>
I
fear
not
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
family
sorrow
,
and
the
sight
of
my
sister
might
be
to
them
as
the
fresh
bleeding
of
wounds
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
daughter
and
sister
who
will
never
be
restored
as
Mirah
is
.
<EOS>
But
who
knows
the
pathways
?
<EOS>
We
are
all
of
us
denying
or
fulfilling
prayers
 
and
men
in
their
careless
deeds
walk
amidst
invisible
outstretched
arms
and
pleadings
made
in
vain
.
<EOS>
In
my
ears
I
have
the
prayers
of
generations
past
and
to
come
.
<EOS>
My
life
is
as
nothing
to
me
but
the
beginning
of
fulfilment
.
<EOS>
And
yet
I
am
only
another
prayer
 
which
you
will
fulfil
.
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
pressed
his
hand
,
and
they
parted
.
      
<EOS>
"
And
you
must
love
him
ere
to
you
  
<EOS>
He
will
seem
worthy
of
your
love
.
"
                          
<EOS>
WORDSWORTH
.
   
<EOS>
One
might
be
tempted
to
envy
Deronda
providing
new
clothes
for
Mordecai
,
and
pleasing
himself
as
if
he
were
sketching
a
picture
in
imagining
the
effect
of
the
fine
gray
flannel
shirts
and
a
dressing
-
gown
very
much
like
a
Franciscan
's
brown
frock
,
with
Mordecai
's
head
and
neck
above
them
.
<EOS>
Half
his
pleasure
was
the
sense
of
seeing
Mirah
's
brother
through
her
eyes
,
and
securing
her
fervid
joy
from
any
perturbing
impression
.
<EOS>
And
yet
,
after
he
had
made
all
things
ready
,
he
was
visited
with
doubt
whether
he
were
not
mistaking
her
,
and
putting
the
lower
effect
for
the
higher
:
was
she
not
just
as
capable
as
he
himself
had
been
of
feeling
the
impressive
distinction
in
her
brother
all
the
more
for
that
aspect
of
poverty
which
was
among
the
memorials
of
his
past
?
<EOS>
But
there
were
the
Meyricks
to
be
propitiated
toward
this
too
Judaic
brother
;
and
Deronda
detected
himself
piqued
into
getting
out
of
sight
everything
that
might
feed
the
ready
repugnance
in
minds
unblessed
with
that
precious
"
seeing
,
"
that
bathing
of
all
objects
in
a
solemnity
as
of
sun
-
set
glow
,
which
is
begotten
of
a
loving
reverential
emotion
.
  
<EOS>
And
his
inclination
would
have
been
the
more
confirmed
if
he
had
heard
the
dialogue
round
Mrs.
Meyrick
's
fire
late
in
the
evening
,
after
Mirah
had
gone
to
her
room
.
<EOS>
Hans
,
settled
now
in
his
Chelsea
rooms
,
had
stayed
late
,
and
<EOS>
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
poking
the
fire
into
a
blaze
,
said
    
"
<EOS>
Now
,
Kate
,
put
out
your
candle
,
and
all
come
round
the
fire
cosily
.
<EOS>
Hans
,
dear
,
do
leave
off
laughing
at
those
poems
for
the
ninety
-
ninth
time
,
and
come
too
.
<EOS>
I
have
something
wonderful
to
tell
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
if
I
did
n't
know
that
,
ma
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
it
in
the
corner
of
your
eye
ever
so
long
,
and
in
your
pretense
of
errands
,
"
said
Kate
,
while
the
girls
came
up
to
put
their
feet
on
the
fender
,
and
Hans
,
pushing
his
chair
near
them
,
sat
astride
it
,
resting
his
fists
and
chin
on
the
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
if
you
are
so
wise
,
perhaps
you
know
that
Mirah
's
brother
is
found
!
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
in
her
clearest
accents
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
confound
it
!
"
<EOS>
said
Hans
,
in
the
same
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hans
,
that
is
wicked
,
"
said
Mab
.
<EOS>
"
Suppose
we
had
lost
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
_
can
not
_
help
being
rather
sorry
,
"
said
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
her
mother
?
 
<EOS>
where
is
she
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Her
mother
is
dead
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
the
brother
is
not
a
bad
man
,
"
said
Amy
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
a
fellow
<EOS>
all
smiles
and
jewelry
 
<EOS>
a
Crystal
Palace
Assyrian
with
a
hat
on
,
"
said
Hans
,
in
the
worst
humor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Were
there
ever
such
unfeeling
children
?
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
a
little
strengthened
by
the
need
for
opposition
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
think
the
least
bit
of
Mirah
's
joy
in
the
matter
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
ma
,
Mirah
hardly
remembers
her
brother
,
"
said
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
"
People
who
are
lost
for
twelve
years
should
never
come
back
again
,
"
said
Hans
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
always
in
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Hans
!
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
reproachfully
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
had
lost
me
for
_
twenty
<EOS>
_
years
,
I
should
have
thought
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
said
twelve
years
,
"
Hans
broke
in
.
"
<EOS>
Anywhere
about
twelve
years
is
the
time
at
which
lost
relations
should
keep
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
it
's
nice
finding
people
 
<EOS>
there
is
something
to
tell
,
"
said
Mab
,
clasping
her
knees
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Did
Prince
Camaralzaman
find
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
Then
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
in
her
neat
,
narrative
way
,
told
all
she
knew
without
interruption
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Deronda
has
the
highest
admiration
for
him
,
"
she
ended
 
<EOS>
"
seems
quite
to
look
up
to
him
.
<EOS>
And
he
says
Mirah
is
just
the
sister
to
understand
this
brother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Deronda
is
getting
perfectly
preposterous
about
those
Jews
,
"
said
Hans
with
disgust
,
rising
and
setting
his
chair
away
with
a
bang
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
wants
to
do
everything
he
can
to
encourage
Mirah
in
her
prejudices
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
for
shame
,
Hans
!
 
<EOS>
to
speak
in
that
way
of
Mr.
Deronda
,
"
said
Mab
.
<EOS>
And
Mrs.
Meyrick
's
face
showed
something
like
an
under
-
current
of
expression
not
allowed
to
get
to
the
surface
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
we
shall
never
be
all
together
,
"
Hans
went
on
,
walking
about
with
his
hands
thrust
into
the
pockets
of
his
brown
velveteen
coat
,
"
but
we
must
have
this
prophet
Elijah
to
tea
with
us
,
and
Mirah
will
think
of
nothing
but
sitting
on
the
ruins
of
Jerusalem
.
<EOS>
She
will
be
spoiled
as
an
artist
 
mind
that
 
she
will
get
as
narrow
as
a
nun
.
<EOS>
Everything
will
be
spoiled
 
our
home
and
everything
.
<EOS>
I
shall
take
to
drinking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
really
,
Hans
,
"
said
Kate
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
think
men
are
the
most
contemptible
animals
in
all
creation
.
<EOS>
Every
one
of
them
must
have
everything
to
his
mind
,
else
he
is
unbearable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
oh
,
oh
,
it
's
very
dreadful
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mab
.
<EOS>
"
I
feel
as
if
ancient
Nineveh
were
come
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
know
what
is
the
good
of
having
gone
to
the
university
and
knowing
everything
,
if
you
are
so
childish
,
Hans
,
"
said
Amy
.
<EOS>
"
You
ought
to
put
up
with
a
man
that
Providence
sends
you
to
be
kind
to
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
We
_
shall
have
to
put
up
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
will
all
of
you
like
the
new
Lamentations
of
Jeremiah
 
'
to
be
continued
in
our
next
'
 
<EOS>
that
's
all
,
"
said
Hans
,
seizing
his
wide
-
awake
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
no
use
being
one
thing
more
than
another
if
one
has
to
endure
the
company
of
those
men
with
a
fixed
idea
,
staring
blankly
at
you
,
and
requiring
all
your
remarks
to
be
small
foot
-
notes
to
their
text
.
<EOS>
If
you
're
to
be
under
a
petrifying
wall
,
you
'd
better
be
an
old
boot
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
feel
myself
an
old
boot
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
abruptly
,
"
Good
night
,
little
mother
,
"
bending
to
kiss
her
brow
in
a
hasty
,
desperate
manner
,
and
condescendingly
,
on
his
way
to
the
door
,
"
Good
-
night
,
girls
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Suppose
Mirah
knew
how
you
are
behaving
,
"
said
Kate
.
<EOS>
But
her
answer
was
a
slam
of
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
I
_
<EOS>
should
_
like
to
see
Mirah
when
Mr.
Deronda
tells
her
<EOS>
,
"
she
went
on
to
her
mother
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
she
will
look
so
beautiful
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
Deronda
,
on
second
thoughts
,
had
written
a
letter
,
which
Mrs.
Meyrick
received
the
next
morning
,
begging
her
to
make
the
revelation
instead
of
waiting
for
him
,
not
giving
the
real
reason
 
that
he
shrank
from
going
again
through
a
narrative
in
which
he
seemed
to
be
making
himself
important
and
giving
himself
a
character
of
general
beneficence
 
but
saying
that
he
wished
to
remain
with
Mordecai
while
Mrs.
Meyrick
would
bring
Mirah
on
what
was
to
be
understood
as
a
visit
,
so
that
there
might
be
a
little
interval
before
that
change
of
abode
which
he
expected
that
Mirah
herself
would
propose
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
secretly
felt
some
wondering
anxiety
how
far
Mordecai
,
after
years
of
solitary
preoccupation
with
ideas
likely
to
have
become
the
more
exclusive
from
continual
diminution
of
bodily
strength
,
would
allow
him
to
feel
a
tender
interest
in
his
sister
over
and
above
the
rendering
of
pious
duties
.
<EOS>
His
feeling
for
the
Cohens
,
and
especially
for
little
Jacob
,
showed
a
persistent
activity
of
affection
;
but
these
objects
had
entered
into
his
daily
life
for
years
;
and
Deronda
felt
it
noticeable
that
Mordecai
asked
no
new
questions
about
Mirah
,
maintaining
,
indeed
,
an
unusual
silence
on
all
subjects
,
and
appearing
simply
to
submit
to
the
changes
that
were
coming
over
his
personal
life
.
<EOS>
He
donned
the
new
clothes
obediently
,
but
said
afterward
to
Deronda
,
with
a
faint
smile
,
"
I
must
keep
my
old
garments
by
me
for
a
remembrance
.
"
<EOS>
And
when
they
were
seated
,
awaiting
Mirah
,
he
uttered
no
word
,
keeping
his
eyelids
closed
,
but
yet
showing
restless
feeling
in
his
face
and
hands
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
Mordecai
was
undergoing
that
peculiar
nervous
perturbation
only
known
to
those
whose
minds
,
long
and
habitually
moving
with
strong
impetus
in
one
current
,
are
suddenly
compelled
into
a
new
or
reopened
channel
.
<EOS>
Susceptible
people
,
whose
strength
has
been
long
absorbed
by
dormant
bias
,
dread
an
interview
that
imperiously
revives
the
past
,
as
they
would
dread
a
threatening
illness
.
<EOS>
Joy
may
be
there
,
but
joy
,
too
,
is
terrible
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
felt
the
infection
of
excitement
,
and
when
he
heard
the
ring
at
the
door
,
he
went
out
,
not
knowing
exactly
why
,
that
he
might
see
and
greet
Mirah
beforehand
.
<EOS>
He
was
startled
to
find
that
she
had
on
the
hat
and
cloak
in
which
he
had
first
seen
her
 
the
memorable
cloak
that
had
once
been
wetted
for
a
winding
-
sheet
.
<EOS>
She
had
come
down
-
stairs
equipped
in
this
way
;
and
when
Mrs.
Meyrick
said
,
in
a
tone
of
question
,
"
You
like
to
go
in
that
dress
,
dear
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
answered
,
"
My
brother
is
poor
,
and
I
want
to
look
as
much
like
him
as
I
can
,
else
he
may
feel
distant
from
me
"
 
imagining
that
she
should
meet
him
in
the
workman
's
dress
.
<EOS>
Deronda
could
not
make
any
remark
,
but
felt
secretly
rather
ashamed
of
his
own
fastidious
arrangements
.
<EOS>
They
shook
hands
silently
,
for
Mirah
looked
pale
and
awed
.
  
<EOS>
When
Deronda
opened
the
door
for
her
,
Mordecai
had
risen
,
and
had
his
eyes
turned
toward
it
with
an
eager
gaze
.
<EOS>
Mirah
took
only
two
or
three
steps
,
and
then
stood
still
.
<EOS>
They
looked
at
each
other
,
motionless
.
<EOS>
It
was
less
their
own
presence
that
they
felt
than
another
<EOS>
's
;
they
were
meeting
first
in
memories
,
compared
with
which
touch
was
no
union
.
<EOS>
Mirah
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
,
standing
where
she
was
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ezra
,
"
she
said
,
in
exactly
the
same
tone
as
when
she
was
telling
of
her
mother
's
call
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
Mordecai
with
a
sudden
movement
advanced
and
laid
his
hand
on
her
shoulders
.
<EOS>
He
was
the
head
taller
,
and
looked
down
at
her
tenderly
while
he
said
,
"
That
was
our
mother
's
voice
.
<EOS>
You
remember
her
calling
me
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
how
you
answered
her
 
"
Mother
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
I
knew
you
loved
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mirah
threw
her
arms
round
her
brother
's
neck
,
clasped
her
little
hands
behind
it
,
and
drew
down
his
face
,
kissing
it
with
childlike
lavishness
,
Her
hat
fell
backward
on
the
ground
and
disclosed
all
her
curls
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
the
dear
head
,
the
dear
head
?
"
said
Mordecai
,
in
a
low
loving
tone
,
laying
his
thin
hand
gently
on
the
curls
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
ill
,
Ezra
,
"
said
Mirah
,
sadly
looking
at
him
with
more
observation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
dear
child
,
I
shall
not
be
long
with
you
in
the
body
,
"
was
the
quiet
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
will
love
you
and
we
will
talk
to
each
other
,
"
said
Mirah
,
with
a
sweet
outpouring
of
her
words
,
as
spontaneous
as
bird
-
notes
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
everything
,
and
you
will
teach
me
:
 
you
will
teach
me
to
be
a
good
Jewess
 
what
she
would
have
liked
me
to
be
.
<EOS>
I
shall
always
be
with
you
when
I
am
not
working
.
<EOS>
For
I
work
now
.
<EOS>
I
shall
get
money
to
keep
us
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
have
had
such
good
friends
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mirah
until
now
had
quite
forgotten
that
any
one
was
by
,
but
here
she
turned
with
the
prettiest
attitude
,
keeping
one
hand
on
her
brother
's
arm
while
she
looked
at
Mrs.
Meyrick
and
Deronda
.
<EOS>
The
little
mother
's
happy
emotion
in
witnessing
this
meeting
of
brother
and
sister
had
already
won
her
to
Mordecai
,
who
seemed
to
her
really
to
have
more
dignity
and
refinement
than
she
had
felt
obliged
to
believe
in
from
Deronda
's
account
.
  
<EOS>
"
See
this
dear
lady
!
"
said
Mirah
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
a
stranger
,
a
poor
wanderer
,
and
she
believed
in
me
,
and
has
treated
me
as
a
daughter
.
<EOS>
Please
give
my
brother
your
hand
,
"
she
added
,
beseechingly
,
taking
Mrs.
Meyrick
's
hand
and
putting
it
in
Mordecai
's
,
then
pressing
them
both
with
her
own
and
lifting
them
to
her
lips
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
Eternal
Goodness
has
been
with
you
,
"
said
Mordecai
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
helped
to
fulfill
our
mother
's
prayer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
we
will
go
now
,
shall
we
?
 
and
return
later
,
"
said
Deronda
,
laying
a
gentle
pressure
on
Mrs.
Meyrick
's
arm
,
and
she
immediately
complied
.
<EOS>
He
was
afraid
of
any
reference
to
the
facts
about
himself
which
he
had
kept
back
from
Mordecai
,
and
he
felt
no
uneasiness
now
in
the
thought
of
the
brother
and
sister
being
alone
together
.
        
<EOS>
'
Tis
hard
and
ill
-
paid
task
to
order
all
things
beforehand
by
the
rule
    
of
our
own
security
,
as
is
well
hinted
by
Machiavelli
concerning
    
Caesar
Borgia
,
who
,
saith
he
,
had
thought
of
all
that
might
occur
on
    
his
father
's
death
,
and
had
provided
against
every
evil
chance
<EOS>
save
    
only
one
<EOS>
:
it
had
never
come
into
his
mind
that
when
his
father
died
,
    
his
own
death
would
quickly
follow
.
   
<EOS>
Grandcourt
's
importance
as
a
subject
of
this
realm
was
of
the
grandly
passive
kind
which
consists
in
the
inheritance
of
land
.
<EOS>
Political
and
social
movements
touched
him
only
through
the
wire
of
his
rental
,
and
his
most
careful
biographer
need
not
have
read
up
on
Schleswig
-
Holstein
,
the
policy
of
Bismarck
,
trade
-
unions
,
household
suffrage
,
or
even
the
last
commercial
panic
.
<EOS>
He
glanced
over
the
best
newspaper
columns
on
these
topics
,
and
his
views
on
them
can
hardly
be
said
to
have
wanted
breadth
,
since
he
embraced
all
Germans
,
all
commercial
men
,
and
all
voters
liable
to
use
the
wrong
kind
of
soap
,
under
the
general
epithet
of
"
brutes
;
"
but
he
took
no
action
on
these
much
-
agitated
questions
beyond
looking
from
under
his
eyelids
at
any
man
who
mentioned
them
,
and
retaining
a
silence
which
served
to
shake
the
opinions
of
timid
thinkers
.
  
<EOS>
But
Grandcourt
,
within
his
own
sphere
of
interest
,
showed
some
of
the
qualities
which
have
entered
into
triumphal
diplomacy
of
the
wildest
continental
sort
.
  
<EOS>
No
movement
of
Gwendolen
in
relation
to
Deronda
escaped
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
denied
that
he
was
jealous
;
because
jealousy
would
have
implied
some
doubt
of
his
own
power
to
hinder
what
he
had
determined
against
.
<EOS>
That
his
wife
should
have
more
inclination
to
another
man
's
society
than
to
his
own
would
not
pain
him
:
what
he
required
was
that
she
should
be
as
fully
aware
as
she
would
have
been
of
a
locked
hand
-
cuff
,
that
her
inclination
was
helpless
to
decide
anything
in
contradiction
with
his
resolve
.
<EOS>
However
much
of
vacillating
whim
there
might
have
been
in
his
entrance
on
matrimony
,
there
was
no
vacillating
in
his
interpretation
of
the
bond
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
repented
of
his
marriage
;
it
had
really
brought
more
of
aim
into
his
life
,
new
objects
to
exert
his
will
upon
;
and
he
had
not
repented
of
his
choice
.
<EOS>
His
taste
was
fastidious
,
and
Gwendolen
satisfied
it
:
he
would
not
have
liked
a
wife
who
had
not
received
some
elevation
of
rank
from
him
;
nor
one
who
did
not
command
admiration
by
her
mien
and
beauty
;
nor
one
whose
nails
were
not
of
the
right
shape
;
nor
one
the
lobe
of
whose
ear
was
at
all
too
large
and
red
;
nor
one
who
,
even
if
her
nails
and
ears
were
right
,
was
at
the
same
time
a
ninny
,
unable
to
make
spirited
answers
.
<EOS>
These
requirements
may
not
seem
too
exacting
to
refined
contemporaries
whose
own
ability
to
fall
in
love
has
been
held
in
suspense
for
lack
of
indispensable
details
;
but
fewer
perhaps
may
follow
him
in
his
contentment
that
his
wife
should
be
in
a
temper
which
would
dispose
her
to
fly
out
if
she
dared
,
and
that
she
should
have
been
urged
into
marrying
him
by
other
feelings
than
passionate
attachment
.
<EOS>
Still
,
for
those
who
prefer
command
to
love
,
one
does
not
see
why
the
habit
of
mind
should
change
precisely
at
the
point
of
matrimony
.
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
did
not
feel
that
he
had
chosen
the
wrong
wife
;
and
having
taken
on
himself
the
part
of
husband
,
he
was
not
going
in
any
way
to
be
fooled
,
or
allow
himself
to
be
seen
in
a
light
that
could
be
regarded
as
pitiable
.
<EOS>
This
was
his
state
of
mind
 
not
jealousy
;
still
,
his
behavior
in
some
respects
was
<EOS>
as
like
jealousy
as
yellow
is
to
yellow
,
which
color
we
know
may
be
the
effect
of
very
different
causes
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
come
up
to
town
earlier
than
usual
because
he
wished
to
be
on
the
spot
for
legal
consultation
as
to
the
arrangements
of
his
will
,
the
transference
of
mortgages
,
and
that
transaction
with
his
uncle
about
the
succession
to
Diplow
,
which
the
bait
of
ready
money
,
adroitly
dangled
without
importunity
,
had
finally
won
him
to
agree
upon
.
<EOS>
But
another
acceptable
accompaniment
of
his
being
in
town
was
the
presentation
of
himself
with
the
beautiful
bride
whom
he
had
chosen
to
marry
in
spite
of
what
other
people
might
have
expected
of
him
.
<EOS>
It
is
true
that
Grandcourt
went
about
with
the
sense
that
he
did
not
care
a
languid
curse
for
any
one
's
admiration
:
but
this
state
of
not
-
caring
,
just
as
much
as
desire
,
required
its
related
object
 
namely
,
a
world
of
admiring
or
envying
spectators
:
for
if
you
are
fond
of
looking
stonily
at
smiling
persons
 
<EOS>
the
persons
must
be
and
they
must
smile
 
a
rudimentary
truth
which
is
surely
forgotten
by
those
who
complain
of
mankind
as
generally
contemptible
,
since
any
other
aspect
of
the
race
must
disappoint
the
voracity
of
their
contempt
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
,
in
town
for
the
first
time
with
his
wife
,
had
his
non
-
caring
abstinence
from
curses
enlarged
and
diversified
by
splendid
receptions
,
by
conspicuous
rides
and
drives
,
by
presentations
of
himself
with
her
on
all
distinguished
occasions
.
<EOS>
He
wished
her
to
be
sought
after
;
he
liked
that
"
fellows
"
should
be
eager
to
talk
with
her
and
escort
her
within
his
observation
;
there
was
even
a
kind
of
lofty
coquetry
on
her
part
that
he
would
not
have
objected
to
.
<EOS>
But
what
he
did
not
like
were
her
ways
in
relation
to
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
After
the
musical
party
at
Lady
Mallinger
's
,
when
Grandcourt
had
observed
the
dialogue
on
the
settee
as
keenly
as
Hans
had
done
,
it
was
characteristic
of
him
that
he
named
Deronda
for
invitation
along
with
the
Mallingers
,
tenaciously
avoiding
the
possible
suggestion
to
anybody
concerned
that
Deronda
's
presence
or
absence
could
be
of
the
least
importance
to
him
;
and
he
made
no
direct
observation
to
Gwendolen
on
her
behavior
that
evening
,
lest
the
expression
of
his
disgust
should
be
a
little
too
strong
to
satisfy
his
own
pride
.
<EOS>
But
a
few
days
afterward
he
remarked
,
without
being
careful
of
the
_
<EOS>
à
propos
_
    
<EOS>
"
Nothing
makes
a
woman
more
of
a
gawky
than
looking
out
after
people
and
showing
tempers
in
public
.
<EOS>
A
woman
ought
to
have
good
manners
.
<EOS>
Else
it
's
intolerable
to
appear
with
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
made
the
expected
application
,
and
was
not
without
alarm
at
the
notion
of
being
a
gawky
.
<EOS>
For
she
,
too
,
with
her
melancholy
distaste
for
things
,
preferred
that
her
distaste
should
include
admirers
.
<EOS>
But
the
sense
of
overhanging
rebuke
only
intensified
the
strain
of
expectation
toward
any
meeting
with
Deronda
.
<EOS>
The
novelty
and
excitement
of
her
town
life
was
like
the
hurry
and
constant
change
of
foreign
travel
;
whatever
might
be
the
inward
despondency
,
there
was
a
programme
to
be
fulfilled
,
not
without
gratification
to
many
-
sided
self
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
always
happens
with
a
deep
interest
,
the
comparatively
rare
occasions
on
which
she
could
exchange
any
words
with
Deronda
had
a
diffusive
effect
in
her
consciousness
,
magnifying
their
communication
with
each
other
,
and
therefore
enlarging
the
place
she
imagined
it
to
have
in
his
mind
.
<EOS>
How
could
Deronda
help
this
?
<EOS>
He
certainly
did
not
avoid
her
;
rather
he
wished
to
convince
her
by
every
delicate
indirect
<EOS>
means
that
her
confidence
in
him
had
not
been
indiscreet
since
it
had
not
lowered
his
respect
.
<EOS>
Moreover
he
liked
being
near
her
 
<EOS>
how
could
it
be
otherwise
?
<EOS>
She
was
something
more
than
a
problem
:
she
was
a
lovely
woman
,
for
the
turn
of
whose
mind
and
fate
he
had
a
care
which
,
however
futile
it
might
be
,
kept
soliciting
him
as
a
responsibility
,
perhaps
all
the
more
that
,
when
he
dared
to
think
of
his
own
future
,
he
saw
it
lying
far
away
from
this
splendid
sad
-
hearted
creature
,
who
,
because
he
had
once
been
impelled
to
arrest
her
attention
momentarily
,
as
he
might
have
seized
her
arm
with
warning
to
hinder
her
from
stepping
where
there
was
danger
,
had
turned
to
him
with
a
beseeching
persistent
need
.
  
<EOS>
One
instance
in
which
Grandcourt
stimulated
a
feeling
in
Gwendolen
that
he
would
have
liked
to
suppress
without
seeming
to
care
about
it
,
had
relation
to
Mirah
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
inclination
lingered
over
the
project
of
the
singing
lessons
as
a
sort
of
obedience
to
Deronda
's
advice
,
but
day
followed
day
with
that
want
of
perceived
leisure
which
belongs
to
lives
where
there
is
no
work
to
mark
off
intervals
;
and
the
continual
liability
to
Grandcourt
's
presence
and
surveillance
seemed
to
flatten
every
effort
to
the
level
of
the
boredom
which
his
manner
expressed
;
his
negative
mind
was
as
diffusive
as
fog
,
clinging
to
all
objects
,
and
spoiling
all
contact
.
  
<EOS>
But
one
morning
when
they
were
breakfasting
,
Gwendolen
,
in
a
recurrent
fit
of
determination
to
exercise
the
old
spirit
,
said
,
dallying
prettily
over
her
prawns
without
eating
them
    
<EOS>
"
I
think
of
making
myself
accomplished
while
we
are
in
town
,
and
having
singing
lessons
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
said
Grandcourt
,
languidly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
echoed
Gwendolen
,
playing
at
sauciness
;
"
because
I
ca
n't
eat
_
pâté
de
foie
gras
_
to
make
me
sleepy
,
and
I
ca
n't
smoke
,
and
I
ca
n't
go
to
the
club
to
make
me
like
to
come
away
again
 
<EOS>
I
want
a
variety
of
_
ennui
_
.
<EOS>
What
would
be
the
most
convenient
time
,
when
you
are
busy
with
your
lawyers
and
people
,
for
me
to
have
lessons
from
that
little
Jewess
,
whose
singing
is
getting
all
the
rage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whenever
you
like
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
pushing
away
his
plate
,
and
leaning
back
in
his
chair
while
he
looked
at
her
with
his
most
lizard
-
like
expression
and
,
played
with
the
ears
of
the
tiny
spaniel
on
his
lap
<EOS>
(
Gwendolen
had
taken
a
dislike
to
the
dogs
because
they
fawned
on
him
)
.
  
<EOS>
Then
he
said
,
languidly
,
"
I
do
n't
see
why
a
lady
should
sing
.
<EOS>
Amateurs
make
fools
of
themselves
.
<EOS>
A
lady
ca
n't
risk
herself
in
that
way
in
company
.
<EOS>
And
one
does
n't
want
to
hear
squalling
in
private
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
like
frankness
:
that
seems
to
me
a
husband
's
great
charm
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
with
her
little
upward
movement
of
her
chin
,
as
she
turned
her
eyes
away
from
his
,
and
lifting
a
prawn
before
her
,
looked
at
the
boiled
ingenuousness
of
its
eyes
as
preferable
to
the
lizard
's
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
;
"
she
added
,
having
devoured
her
mortification
,
"
I
suppose
you
do
n't
object
to
Miss
Lapidoth
's
singing
at
our
party
on
the
fourth
?
<EOS>
I
thought
of
engaging
her
.
<EOS>
Lady
Brackenshaw
had
her
,
you
know
:
and
the
Raymonds
,
who
are
very
particular
about
their
music
.
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Deronda
,
who
is
a
musician
himself
and
a
first
-
rate
judge
,
says
there
is
no
singing
in
such
good
taste
as
hers
for
a
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
I
think
his
opinion
is
an
authority
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
meant
to
sling
a
small
stone
at
her
husband
in
that
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
indecent
of
Deronda
to
go
about
praising
that
girl
,
"
said
Grandcourt
in
a
tone
of
indifference
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indecent
!
"
exclaimed
Gwendolen
,
reddening
and
looking
at
him
again
,
overcome
by
startled
wonder
,
and
unable
to
reflect
on
the
probable
falsity
of
the
phrase
 
"
to
go
about
praising
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
and
especially
when
she
is
patronized
by
Lady
Mallinger
.
<EOS>
He
ought
to
hold
his
tongue
about
her
.
<EOS>
Men
can
see
what
is
his
relation
to
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Men
who
judge
of
others
by
themselves
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
turning
white
after
her
redness
,
and
immediately
smitten
with
a
dread
of
her
own
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
.
<EOS>
And
a
woman
should
take
their
judgment
 
else
<EOS>
she
is
likely
to
run
her
head
into
the
wrong
place
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
conscious
of
using
pinchers
on
that
white
creature
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
take
Deronda
for
a
saint
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
no
!
"
said
Gwendolen
,
summoning
desperately
her
almost
miraculous
power
of
self
-
control
,
and
speaking
in
a
high
hard
tone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Only
a
little
less
of
a
monster
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
rose
,
pushed
her
chair
away
without
hurry
,
and
walked
out
of
the
room
with
something
like
the
care
of
a
man
who
is
afraid
of
showing
that
he
has
taken
more
wine
than
usual
.
<EOS>
She
turned
the
keys
inside
her
dressing
-
room
doors
,
and
sat
down
for
some
time
looking
pale
and
quiet
as
when
she
was
leaving
the
breakfast
-
room
.
<EOS>
Even
in
the
moments
after
reading
the
poisonous
letter
she
had
hardly
had
more
cruel
sensations
than
now
;
for
emotion
was
at
the
acute
point
,
where
it
is
not
distinguishable
from
sensation
.
<EOS>
Deronda
unlike
what
she
had
believed
him
to
be
,
was
an
image
which
affected
her
as
a
hideous
apparition
would
have
done
,
quite
apart
from
the
way
in
which
it
was
produced
.
<EOS>
It
had
taken
hold
of
her
as
pain
before
she
could
consider
whether
it
were
fiction
or
truth
;
and
further
to
hinder
her
power
of
resistance
came
the
sudden
perception
<EOS>
,
how
very
slight
were
the
grounds
of
her
faith
in
Deronda
 
<EOS>
how
little
she
knew
of
his
life
 
<EOS>
how
childish
she
had
been
in
her
confidence
.
<EOS>
His
rebukes
and
his
severity
to
her
began
to
seem
odious
,
along
with
all
the
poetry
and
lofty
doctrine
in
the
world
,
whatever
it
might
be
;
and
the
grave
beauty
of
his
face
seemed
the
most
unpleasant
mask
that
the
common
habits
of
men
could
put
on
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
went
on
in
her
with
the
rapidity
of
a
sick
dream
;
and
her
start
into
resistance
was
very
much
like
a
waking
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
from
out
the
gray
sombre
morning
there
came
a
stream
of
sunshine
,
wrapping
her
in
warmth
and
light
where
she
sat
in
stony
stillness
.
<EOS>
She
moved
gently
and
looked
round
<EOS>
her
 
<EOS>
there
was
a
world
outside
this
bad
dream
,
and
the
dream
proved
nothing
;
she
rose
,
stretching
her
arms
upward
and
clasping
her
hands
with
her
habitual
attitude
when
she
was
seeking
relief
from
oppressive
feeling
,
and
walked
about
the
room
in
this
flood
of
sunbeams
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
true
!
<EOS>
What
does
it
matter
whether
_
<EOS>
he
_
believes
it
or
not
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
is
what
she
repeated
to
herself
 
<EOS>
but
this
was
not
her
faith
come
back
again
;
it
was
only
the
desperate
cry
of
faith
,
finding
suffocation
intolerable
.
<EOS>
And
how
could
she
go
on
through
the
day
in
this
state
?
<EOS>
With
one
of
her
impetuous
alternations
,
her
imagination
flew
to
wild
actions
by
which
she
would
convince
herself
of
what
she
wished
:
she
would
go
to
Lady
Mallinger
and
question
her
about
Mirah
;
she
would
write
to
Deronda
and
upbraid
him
with
making
the
world
all
false
and
wicked
and
hopeless
to
her
 
to
him
<EOS>
she
dared
pour
out
all
the
bitter
indignation
of
her
heart
.
<EOS>
No
;
she
would
go
to
Mirah
.
<EOS>
This
last
form
taken
by
her
need
was
more
definitely
practicable
,
and
quickly
became
imperious
.
<EOS>
No
matter
what
came
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
had
the
pretext
of
asking
Mirah
to
sing
at
her
party
on
the
fourth
.
<EOS>
What
was
she
going
to
say
beside
?
<EOS>
How
satisfy
?
<EOS>
She
did
not
foresee
 
<EOS>
she
could
not
wait
to
foresee
.
<EOS>
If
that
idea
which
was
maddening
her
had
been
a
living
thing
,
she
would
have
wanted
to
throttle
it
without
waiting
to
foresee
what
would
come
of
the
act
.
<EOS>
She
rang
her
bell
and
asked
if
Mr.
Grandcourt
were
gone
out
:
finding
that
he
was
,
she
ordered
the
carriage
,
and
began
to
dress
for
the
drive
;
then
she
went
down
,
and
walked
about
the
large
drawing
-
room
like
an
imprisoned
dumb
creature
,
not
recognizing
herself
in
the
glass
panels
,
not
noting
any
object
around
her
in
the
painted
gilded
prison
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
would
probably
find
out
where
she
had
been
,
and
punish
her
in
some
way
or
other
 
no
matter
 
<EOS>
she
could
neither
desire
nor
fear
anything
just
now
<EOS>
but
the
assurance
that
she
had
not
been
deluding
herself
in
her
trust
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
provided
with
Mirah
's
address
.
<EOS>
Soon
she
was
on
the
way
with
all
the
fine
equipage
necessary
to
carry
about
her
poor
uneasy
heart
,
depending
in
its
palpitations
on
some
answer
or
other
to
questioning
which
she
did
not
know
how
she
should
put
.
<EOS>
She
was
as
heedless
of
what
happened
before
she
found
that
Miss
Lapidoth
was
at
home
,
as
one
is
of
lobbies
and
passages
on
the
way
to
a
court
of
justice
 
heedless
of
everything
till
she
was
in
a
room
where
there
were
folding
-
doors
,
and
she
heard
Deronda
's
voice
behind
it
.
<EOS>
Doubtless
the
identification
was
helped
by
forecast
,
but
she
was
as
certain
of
it
as
if
she
had
seen
him
.
<EOS>
She
was
frightened
at
her
own
agitation
,
and
began
to
unbutton
her
gloves
that
she
might
button
them
again
,
and
bite
her
lips
over
the
pretended
difficulty
,
while
the
door
opened
,
and
Mirah
presented
herself
with
perfect
quietude
and
a
sweet
smile
of
recognition
.
<EOS>
There
was
relief
in
the
sight
of
her
face
,
and
Gwendolen
was
able
to
smile
in
return
,
while
she
put
out
her
hand
in
silence
;
and
as
she
seated
herself
,
all
the
while
hearing
the
voice
,
she
felt
some
reflux
of
energy
in
the
confused
sense
that
the
truth
could
not
be
anything
that
she
dreaded
.
<EOS>
Mirah
drew
her
chair
very
near
,
as
if
she
felt
that
the
sound
of
the
conversation
should
be
subdued
,
and
looked
at
her
visitor
with
placid
expectation
,
while
Gwendolen
began
in
a
low
tone
,
with
something
that
seemed
like
bashfulness
    
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
wonder
to
see
me
 
<EOS>
perhaps
I
ought
to
have
written
 
<EOS>
but
I
wished
to
make
a
particular
request
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
see
you
instead
of
having
a
letter
,
"
said
Mirah
,
wondering
at
the
changed
expression
and
manner
of
the
"
Vandyke
duchess
,
"
as
Hans
had
taught
her
to
call
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
The
rich
color
and
the
calmness
of
her
own
face
were
in
strong
contrast
with
the
pale
agitated
beauty
under
the
plumed
hat
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
,
"
Gwendolen
went
on
 
"
at
least
I
hoped
,
you
would
not
object
to
sing
at
our
house
on
the
4th
 
in
the
evening
 
at
a
party
like
Lady
Brackenshaw
's
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
so
much
obliged
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
very
happy
to
sing
for
you
.
<EOS>
At
ten
?
"
said
Mirah
,
while
Gwendolen
seemed
to
get
more
instead
of
less
embarrassed
.
  
<EOS>
"
At
ten
,
please
,
"
she
answered
;
then
paused
,
and
felt
that
she
had
nothing
more
to
say
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
go
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
rise
and
say
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
Deronda
's
voice
was
in
her
ears
.
<EOS>
She
must
say
it
 
<EOS>
she
could
contrive
no
other
sentence
    
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Deronda
is
in
the
next
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Mirah
,
in
her
former
tone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
reading
Hebrew
with
my
brother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
brother
?
"
said
Gwendolen
,
who
had
heard
this
from
Lady
Mallinger
,
but
had
not
minded
it
then
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
a
dear
brother
who
is
ill
-
consumptive
,
and
Mr.
Deronda
is
the
best
of
friends
to
him
,
as
he
has
been
to
me
,
"
said
Mirah
,
with
the
impulse
that
will
not
let
us
pass
the
mention
of
a
precious
person
indifferently
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
putting
her
hand
on
Mirah
's
,
and
speaking
hardly
above
a
whisper
 
<EOS>
"
tell
me
 
tell
me
the
truth
.
<EOS>
You
are
sure
he
is
quite
good
.
<EOS>
You
know
no
evil
of
him
.
<EOS>
Any
evil
that
people
say
of
him
is
false
.
"
  
<EOS>
Could
the
proud
-
spirited
woman
have
behaved
more
like
a
child
?
<EOS>
But
the
strange
words
penetrated
Mirah
with
nothing
but
a
sense
of
solemnity
and
indignation
.
<EOS>
With
a
sudden
light
in
her
eyes
and
a
tremor
in
her
voice
,
she
said
    
"
Who
are
the
people
that
say
evil
of
him
?
<EOS>
I
would
not
believe
any
evil
of
him
,
if
an
angel
came
to
tell
it
me
.
<EOS>
He
found
me
when
I
was
so
miserable
 
<EOS>
I
was
going
to
drown
myself
;
I
looked
so
poor
and
forsaken
;
you
would
have
thought
I
was
a
beggar
by
the
wayside
.
<EOS>
And
he
treated
me
as
if
I
had
been
a
king
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
He
took
me
to
the
best
of
women
.
<EOS>
He
found
my
brother
for
me
.
<EOS>
And
he
honors
my
brother
 
though
he
too
was
poor
 
<EOS>
oh
,
almost
as
poor
as
he
could
be
.
<EOS>
And
my
brother
honors
him
.
<EOS>
That
is
no
light
thing
to
say
"
 
here
Mirah
's
tone
changed
to
one
of
profound
emphasis
,
and
she
shook
her
head
backward
:
"
for
my
brother
is
very
learned
and
great
-
minded
.
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Deronda
says
there
are
few
men
equal
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
Some
Jewish
defiance
had
flamed
into
her
indignant
gratitude
and
her
anger
could
not
help
including
Gwendolen
since
she
seemed
to
have
doubted
Deronda
's
goodness
.
  
<EOS>
But
Gwendolen
was
like
one
parched
with
thirst
,
drinking
the
fresh
water
that
spreads
through
the
frame
as
a
sufficient
bliss
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
notice
that
Mirah
was
angry
with
her
;
she
was
not
distinctly
conscious
of
anything
but
of
the
penetrating
sense
that
Deronda
and
his
life
were
no
more
like
her
husband
's
conception
than
the
morning
in
the
horizon
<EOS>
was
like
the
morning
mixed
with
street
gas
.
<EOS>
Even
Mirah
's
words
sank
into
the
indefiniteness
of
her
relief
.
<EOS>
She
could
hardly
have
repeated
them
,
or
said
how
her
whole
state
of
feeling
was
changed
.
<EOS>
She
pressed
Mirah
's
hand
,
and
said
,
"
Thank
you
,
thank
you
,
"
in
a
hurried
whisper
,
then
rose
,
and
added
,
with
only
a
hazy
consciousness
,
"
I
must
go
,
I
shall
see
you
 
on
the
fourth
 
<EOS>
I
am
so
much
obliged
"
 
bowing
herself
out
automatically
,
while
Mirah
,
opening
the
door
for
her
,
wondered
at
what
seemed
a
sudden
retreat
into
chill
loftiness
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
indeed
,
had
no
feeling
to
spare
in
any
effusiveness
toward
the
creature
who
had
brought
her
relief
.
<EOS>
The
passionate
need
of
contradiction
to
Grandcourt
's
estimate
of
Deronda
,
a
need
which
had
blunted
her
sensibility
to
everything
else
,
was
no
sooner
satisfied
than
she
wanted
to
be
gone
.
<EOS>
She
began
to
be
aware
that
she
was
out
of
place
,
and
to
dread
Deronda
's
seeing
her
.
<EOS>
And
once
in
the
carriage
again
,
she
had
the
vision
of
what
awaited
her
at
home
.
<EOS>
When
she
drew
up
before
the
door
in
Grosvenor
Square
,
her
husband
was
arriving
with
a
cigar
between
his
fingers
.
<EOS>
He
threw
it
away
and
handed
her
out
,
accompanying
her
up
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
She
turned
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
lest
he
should
follow
her
farther
and
give
her
no
place
to
retreat
to
;
then
she
sat
down
with
a
weary
air
,
taking
off
her
gloves
,
rubbing
her
hand
over
her
forehead
,
and
making
his
presence
as
much
of
a
cipher
as
possible
.
<EOS>
But
he
sat
,
too
,
and
not
far
from
her
 
just
in
front
,
where
to
avoid
looking
at
him
must
have
the
emphasis
of
effort
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
where
you
have
been
at
this
extraordinary
hour
?
"
said
Grandcourt
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
;
I
have
been
to
Miss
Lapidoth
's
,
to
ask
her
to
come
and
sing
for
us
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
laying
her
gloves
on
the
little
table
beside
her
,
and
looking
down
at
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
to
ask
her
about
her
relations
with
Deronda
?
"
said
Grandcourt
,
with
the
coldest
possible
sneer
in
his
low
voice
which
in
poor
Gwendolen
's
ear
was
diabolical
.
  
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
since
their
marriage
she
flashed
out
upon
him
without
inward
check
.
<EOS>
Turning
her
eyes
full
on
his
she
said
,
in
a
biting
tone
    
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
and
what
you
said
is
false
 
<EOS>
a
low
,
wicked
falsehood
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
told
you
so
 
did
she
?
"
returned
Grandcourt
,
with
a
more
thoroughly
distilled
sneer
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
was
mute
.
<EOS>
The
daring
anger
within
her
was
turned
into
the
rage
of
dumbness
.
<EOS>
What
reasons
for
her
belief
could
she
give
?
<EOS>
All
the
reasons
that
seemed
so
strong
and
living
within
her
 
<EOS>
she
saw
them
suffocated
and
shrivelled
up
under
her
husband
's
breath
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
proof
to
give
,
but
her
own
impression
,
which
would
seem
to
him
her
own
folly
.
<EOS>
She
turned
her
head
quickly
away
from
him
and
looked
angrily
toward
the
end
of
the
room
:
she
would
have
risen
,
but
he
was
in
her
way
.
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
saw
his
advantage
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
of
no
consequence
so
far
as
her
singing
goes
,
"
he
said
,
in
his
superficial
drawl
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
have
her
to
sing
,
if
you
like
.
"
<EOS>
Then
,
after
a
pause
,
he
added
in
his
lowest
imperious
tone
,
"
But
you
will
please
to
observe
that
you
are
not
to
go
near
that
house
again
.
<EOS>
As
my
wife
,
you
must
take
my
word
about
what
is
proper
for
you
.
<EOS>
When
you
undertook
to
be
Mrs.
Grandcourt
,
you
undertook
not
to
make
a
fool
of
yourself
.
<EOS>
You
have
been
making
a
fool
of
yourself
this
morning
;
and
if
you
were
to
go
on
as
you
have
begun
,
you
might
soon
get
yourself
talked
of
at
the
clubs
in
a
way
you
would
not
like
.
<EOS>
What
do
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
you
<EOS>
_
know
about
the
world
?
<EOS>
You
have
married
_
me
_
,
and
must
be
guided
by
my
opinion
.
"
  
<EOS>
Every
slow
sentence
of
that
speech
had
a
terrific
mastery
in
it
for
Gwendolen
's
nature
.
<EOS>
If
the
low
tones
had
come
from
a
physician
telling
her
that
her
symptoms
were
those
of
a
fatal
disease
,
and
prognosticating
its
course
,
she
could
not
have
been
more
helpless
against
the
argument
that
lay
in
it
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
permitted
to
move
now
,
and
her
husband
never
again
made
any
reference
to
what
had
occurred
this
morning
.
<EOS>
He
knew
the
force
of
his
own
words
.
<EOS>
If
this
white
-
handed
man
with
the
perpendicular
profile
had
been
sent
to
govern
a
difficult
colony
,
he
might
have
won
reputation
among
his
contemporaries
.
<EOS>
He
had
certainly
ability
,
would
have
understood
that
it
was
safer
to
exterminate
than
to
cajole
superseded
proprietors
,
and
would
not
have
flinched
from
making
things
safe
in
that
way
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
did
not
,
for
all
this
,
part
with
her
recovered
faith
;
 
rather
,
she
kept
it
with
a
more
anxious
tenacity
,
as
a
Protestant
of
old
kept
his
bible
hidden
or
a
Catholic
his
crucifix
,
according
to
the
side
favored
by
the
civil
arm
;
and
it
was
characteristic
of
her
that
apart
from
the
impression
gained
concerning
Deronda
in
that
visit
,
her
imagination
was
little
occupied
with
Mirah
or
the
eulogised
brother
.
<EOS>
The
one
result
established
for
her
was
,
that
Deronda
had
acted
simply
as
a
generous
benefactor
,
and
the
phrase
"
reading
Hebrew
"
had
fleeted
unimpressively
across
her
sense
of
hearing
,
as
a
stray
stork
might
have
made
its
peculiar
flight
across
her
landscape
without
rousing
any
surprised
reflection
on
its
natural
history
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
issue
of
that
visit
,
as
it
regarded
her
husband
,
took
a
strongly
active
part
in
the
process
which
made
an
habitual
conflict
within
her
,
and
was
the
cause
of
some
external
change
perhaps
not
observed
by
any
one
except
Deronda
.
<EOS>
As
the
weeks
went
on
bringing
occasional
transient
interviews
with
her
,
he
thought
that
he
perceived
in
her
an
intensifying
of
her
superficial
hardness
and
resolute
display
,
which
made
her
abrupt
betrayals
of
agitation
the
more
marked
and
disturbing
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
In
fact
,
she
was
undergoing
a
sort
of
discipline
for
the
refractory
which
,
as
little
as
possible
like
conversion
,
bends
half
the
self
with
a
terrible
strain
,
and
exasperates
the
unwillingness
of
the
other
half
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
had
an
active
divination
rather
than
discernment
of
refractoriness
in
her
,
and
what
had
happened
about
Mirah
quickened
his
suspicion
that
there
was
an
increase
of
it
dependent
on
the
occasions
when
she
happened
to
see
Deronda
<EOS>
:
there
was
some
"
confounded
nonsense
"
between
them
:
he
did
not
imagine
it
exactly
as
flirtation
,
and
his
imagination
in
other
branches
was
rather
restricted
;
but
it
was
nonsense
that
evidently
kept
up
a
kind
of
simmering
in
her
mind
 
<EOS>
an
inward
action
which
might
become
disagreeable
outward
.
<EOS>
Husbands
in
the
old
time
are
known
to
have
suffered
from
a
threatening
devoutness
in
their
wives
,
presenting
itself
first
indistinctly
as
oddity
,
and
ending
in
that
mild
form
of
lunatic
asylum
,
a
nunnery
:
Grandcourt
had
a
vague
perception
of
threatening
moods
in
Gwendolen
which
the
unity
between
them
in
his
views
of
marriage
required
him
peremptorily
to
check
.
<EOS>
Among
the
means
he
chose
,
one
was
peculiar
,
and
was
less
ably
calculated
than
the
speeches
we
have
just
heard
.
  
<EOS>
He
determined
that
she
should
know
the
main
purport
of
the
will
he
was
making
,
but
he
could
not
communicate
this
himself
,
because
it
involved
the
fact
of
his
relation
to
Mrs.
Glasher
and
her
children
;
and
that
there
should
be
any
overt
recognition
of
this
between
Gwendolen
and
himself
was
supremely
repugnant
to
him
.
<EOS>
Like
all
proud
,
closely
-
wrapped
natures
,
he
shrank
from
explicitness
and
detail
,
even
on
trivialities
,
if
they
were
personal
:
a
valet
must
maintain
a
strict
reserve
with
him
on
the
subject
of
shoes
and
stockings
.
<EOS>
And
clashing
was
intolerable
to
him
;
his
habitual
want
was
to
put
collision
out
of
the
question
by
the
quiet
massive
pressure
of
his
rule
.
<EOS>
But
he
wished
Gwendolen
to
know
that
before
he
made
her
an
offer
it
was
no
secret
to
him
that
she
was
aware
of
his
relations
with
Lydia
,
her
previous
knowledge
being
the
apology
for
bringing
the
subject
before
her
now
.
<EOS>
Some
men
in
his
place
might
have
thought
of
writing
what
he
wanted
her
to
know
,
in
the
form
of
a
letter
.
<EOS>
But
Grandcourt
hated
writing
:
even
writing
a
note
was
a
bore
to
him
,
and
he
had
long
been
accustomed
to
have
all
his
writing
done
by
Lush
.
<EOS>
We
know
that
there
are
persons
who
will
forego
their
own
obvious
interest
rather
than
do
anything
so
disagreeable
as
to
write
letters
;
and
it
is
not
probable
that
these
imperfect
utilitarians
would
rush
into
manuscript
and
syntax
on
a
difficult
subject
in
order
to
save
another
's
feelings
.
<EOS>
To
Grandcourt
it
did
not
even
occur
that
he
should
,
would
,
or
could
write
to
Gwendolen
the
information
in
question
;
and
the
only
medium
of
communication
he
could
use
was
Lush
,
who
,
to
his
mind
,
was
as
much
of
an
implement
as
pen
and
paper
.
<EOS>
But
here
too
Grandcourt
had
his
reserves
,
and
would
not
have
uttered
a
word
likely
to
encourage
Lush
in
an
impudent
sympathy
with
any
supposed
grievance
in
a
marriage
which
had
been
discommended
by
him
.
<EOS>
Who
that
has
a
confidant
escapes
believing
too
little
in
his
penetration
,
and
too
much
in
his
discretion
?
<EOS>
Grandcourt
had
always
allowed
Lush
to
know
his
external
affairs
indiscriminately
 
irregularities
,
debts
,
want
of
ready
money
;
he
had
only
used
discrimination
about
what
he
would
allow
his
confidant
to
say
to
him
;
and
he
had
been
so
accustomed
to
this
human
tool
,
that
the
having
him
at
call
in
London
was
a
recovery
of
lost
ease
.
<EOS>
It
followed
that
Lush
knew
all
the
provisions
of
the
will
more
exactly
than
they
were
known
to
the
testator
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
did
not
doubt
that
Gwendolen
,
since
she
was
a
woman
who
could
put
two
and
two
together
,
knew
or
suspected
Lush
to
be
the
contriver
of
her
interview
with
Lydia
,
and
that
this
was
the
reason
why
her
first
request
was
for
his
banishment
.
<EOS>
But
the
bent
of
a
woman
's
inferences
on
mixed
subjects
which
excites
mixed
passions
is
not
determined
by
her
capacity
for
simple
addition
;
and
here
Grandcourt
lacked
the
only
organ
of
thinking
that
could
have
saved
him
from
mistake
 
namely
,
some
experience
of
the
mixed
passions
concerned
.
<EOS>
He
had
correctly
divined
one
-
half
of
Gwendolen
's
dread
 
all
that
related
to
her
personal
pride
,
and
her
perception
that
his
will
must
conquer
hers
;
but
the
remorseful
half
,
even
if
he
had
known
of
her
broken
promise
,
was
as
much
out
of
his
imagination
as
the
other
side
of
the
moon
.
<EOS>
What
he
believed
her
to
feel
about
Lydia
was
solely
a
tongue
-
tied
jealousy
,
and
what
he
believed
Lydia
to
have
written
with
the
jewels
was
the
fact
that
she
had
once
been
used
to
wearing
them
,
with
other
amenities
such
as
he
imputed
to
the
intercourse
with
jealous
women
.
<EOS>
He
had
the
triumphant
certainty
that
he
could
aggravate
the
jealousy
and
yet
smite
it
with
a
more
absolute
dumbness
.
<EOS>
His
object
was
to
engage
all
his
wife
's
egoism
on
the
same
side
as
his
own
,
and
in
his
employment
of
Lush
he
did
not
intend
an
insult
to
her
:
she
ought
to
understand
that
he
was
the
only
possible
envoy
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
's
view
of
things
was
considerably
fenced
in
by
his
general
sense
,
that
what
suited
him
others
must
put
up
with
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
escaping
the
fact
that
want
of
sympathy
condemns
us
to
corresponding
stupidity
.
<EOS>
Mephistopheles
thrown
upon
real
life
,
and
obliged
to
manage
his
own
plots
,
would
inevitably
make
blunders
.
  
<EOS>
One
morning
he
went
to
Gwendolen
in
the
boudoir
beyond
the
back
drawing
-
room
,
hat
and
gloves
in
hand
,
and
said
with
his
best
-
tempered
,
most
persuasive
drawl
,
standing
before
her
and
looking
down
on
her
as
she
sat
with
a
book
on
her
lap
    
<EOS>
"
A
 
Gwendolen
,
there
's
some
business
about
property
to
be
explained
.
<EOS>
I
have
told
Lush
to
come
and
explain
it
to
you
.
<EOS>
He
knows
all
about
these
things
.
<EOS>
I
am
going
out
.
<EOS>
He
can
come
up
now
.
<EOS>
He
's
the
only
person
who
can
explain
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
'll
not
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
that
I
do
mind
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
angrily
,
starting
up
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
see
him
.
"
<EOS>
She
showed
the
intention
to
dart
away
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
was
before
her
,
with
his
back
toward
it
.
<EOS>
He
was
prepared
for
her
anger
,
and
showed
none
in
return
,
saying
,
with
the
same
sort
of
remonstrant
tone
that
he
might
have
used
about
an
objection
to
dining
out
    
"
It
's
no
use
making
a
fuss
.
<EOS>
There
are
plenty
of
brutes
in
the
world
that
one
has
to
talk
to
.
<EOS>
People
with
any
_
savoir
vivre
<EOS>
_
do
n't
make
a
fuss
about
such
things
.
<EOS>
Some
business
must
be
done
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
expect
agreeable
people
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
If
I
employ
Lush
,
the
proper
thing
for
you
is
to
take
it
as
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
Not
to
make
a
fuss
about
it
.
<EOS>
Not
to
toss
your
head
and
bite
your
lips
about
people
of
that
sort
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
drawling
and
the
pauses
with
which
this
speech
was
uttered
gave
time
for
crowding
reflections
in
Gwendolen
,
quelling
her
resistance
.
<EOS>
What
was
there
to
be
told
her
about
property
?
<EOS>
This
word
had
certain
dominant
associations
for
her
,
first
with
her
mother
,
then
with
Mrs.
Glasher
and
her
children
.
<EOS>
What
would
be
the
use
if
she
refused
to
see
Lush
?
<EOS>
Could
she
ask
Grandcourt
to
tell
her
himself
?
<EOS>
That
might
be
intolerable
,
even
if
he
consented
,
which
it
was
certain
he
would
not
,
if
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
The
humiliation
of
standing
an
obvious
prisoner
,
with
her
husband
barring
the
door
,
was
not
to
be
borne
any
longer
,
and
she
turned
away
to
lean
against
a
cabinet
,
while
Grandcourt
again
moved
toward
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
arranged
for
Lush
to
come
up
now
,
while
I
am
out
,
"
he
said
,
after
a
long
organ
stop
,
during
which
Gwendolen
made
no
sign
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
I
tell
him
he
may
come
?
"
  
<EOS>
Yet
another
pause
before
she
could
say
"
Yes
"
 
her
face
turned
obliquely
and
her
eyes
cast
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
come
back
in
time
to
ride
,
if
you
like
to
get
ready
,
"
said
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
No
answer
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
in
a
desperate
rage
,
"
thought
he
.
<EOS>
But
the
rage
was
silent
,
and
therefore
not
disagreeable
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
followed
that
he
turned
her
chin
and
kissed
her
,
while
she
still
kept
her
eyelids
down
,
and
she
did
not
move
them
until
he
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
What
was
she
to
do
?
<EOS>
Search
where
she
would
in
her
consciousness
,
she
found
no
plea
to
justify
a
plaint
.
<EOS>
Any
romantic
illusions
she
had
had
in
marrying
this
man
had
turned
on
her
power
of
using
him
as
she
liked
.
<EOS>
He
was
using
her
as
he
liked
.
  
<EOS>
She
sat
awaiting
the
announcement
of
Lush
as
a
sort
of
searing
operation
that
she
had
to
go
through
.
<EOS>
The
facts
that
galled
her
gathered
a
burning
power
when
she
thought
of
their
lying
in
his
mind
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
a
part
of
that
new
gambling
,
in
which
the
losing
was
not
simply
a
_
minus
_
,
but
a
terrible
_
plus
_
that
had
never
entered
into
her
reckoning
.
  
<EOS>
Lush
was
neither
quite
pleased
nor
quite
displeased
with
his
task
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
had
said
to
him
by
way
of
conclusion
,
"
Do
n't
make
yourself
more
disagreeable
than
nature
obliges
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
depends
,
"
thought
Lush
.
<EOS>
But
he
said
,
"
I
will
write
a
brief
abstract
for
Mrs.
Grandcourt
to
read
.
"
<EOS>
He
did
not
suggest
that
he
should
make
the
whole
communication
in
writing
,
which
was
a
proof
that
the
interview
did
not
wholly
displease
him
.
  
<EOS>
Some
provision
was
being
made
for
himself
in
the
will
,
and
he
had
no
reason
to
be
in
a
bad
humor
,
even
if
a
bad
humor
had
been
common
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
perfectly
convinced
that
he
had
penetrated
all
the
secrets
of
the
situation
;
but
he
had
no
diabolical
delight
in
it
.
<EOS>
He
had
only
the
small
movements
of
gratified
self
-
loving
resentment
in
discerning
that
this
marriage
had
fulfilled
his
own
foresight
in
not
being
as
satisfactory
as
the
supercilious
young
lady
had
expected
it
to
be
,
and
as
Grandcourt
wished
to
feign
that
it
was
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
persistent
spite
much
stronger
than
what
gives
the
seasoning
of
ordinary
scandal
to
those
who
repeat
it
and
exaggerate
it
by
their
conjectures
.
<EOS>
With
no
active
compassion
or
good
-
will
,
he
had
just
as
little
active
malevolence
,
being
chiefly
occupied
in
liking
his
particular
pleasures
,
and
not
disliking
anything
<EOS>
but
what
hindered
those
pleasures
 
everything
else
ranking
with
the
last
murder
and
the
last
_
opéra
bouffe
_
,
under
the
head
of
things
to
talk
about
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
he
was
not
indifferent
to
the
prospect
of
being
treated
uncivilly
by
a
beautiful
woman
,
or
to
the
counter
-
balancing
fact
that
his
present
commission
put
into
his
hands
an
official
power
of
humiliating
her
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
mean
to
use
it
needlessly
;
but
there
are
some
persons
so
gifted
in
relation
to
us
that
their
"
How
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
seems
charged
with
offense
.
  
<EOS>
By
the
time
that
Mr.
Lush
was
announced
,
Gwendolen
had
braced
herself
to
a
bitter
resolve
that
he
should
not
witness
the
slightest
betrayal
of
her
feeling
,
whatever
he
might
have
to
tell
.
<EOS>
She
invited
him
to
sit
down
with
stately
quietude
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
what
was
this
man
to
her
?
<EOS>
He
was
not
in
the
least
like
her
husband
.
<EOS>
Her
power
of
hating
a
coarse
,
familiar
-
mannered
man
,
with
clumsy
hands
,
was
now
relaxed
by
the
intensity
with
which
she
hated
his
contrast
.
  
<EOS>
He
held
a
small
paper
folded
in
his
hand
while
he
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
need
hardly
say
that
I
should
not
have
presented
myself
if
Mr.
Grandcourt
had
not
expressed
a
strong
wish
to
that
effect
 
as
no
doubt
he
has
mentioned
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
From
some
voices
that
speech
might
have
sounded
entirely
reverential
,
and
even
timidly
apologetic
.
<EOS>
Lush
had
no
intention
to
the
contrary
,
but
to
Gwendolen
's
ear
his
words
had
as
much
insolence
in
them
as
his
prominent
eyes
,
and
the
pronoun
"
<EOS>
you
"
was
too
familiar
.
<EOS>
He
ought
to
have
addressed
the
folding
-
screen
,
and
spoke
of
her
as
Mrs.
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
She
gave
the
smallest
sign
of
a
bow
,
and
Lush
went
on
,
with
a
little
awkwardness
,
getting
entangled
in
what
is
elegantly
called
tautology
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
having
been
in
Mr.
Grandcourt
's
confidence
for
fifteen
years
or
more
 
since
he
was
a
youth
,
in
fact
 
of
course
gives
me
a
peculiar
position
.
<EOS>
He
can
speak
to
me
of
affairs
that
he
could
not
mention
to
any
one
else
;
and
,
in
fact
,
he
could
not
have
employed
any
one
else
in
this
affair
.
<EOS>
I
have
accepted
the
task
out
of
friendship
for
him
.
<EOS>
Which
is
my
apology
for
accepting
the
task
 
if
you
would
have
preferred
some
one
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
paused
,
but
she
made
no
sign
,
and
Lush
,
to
give
himself
a
countenance
in
an
apology
which
met
no
acceptance
,
opened
the
folded
paper
,
and
looked
at
it
vaguely
before
he
began
to
speak
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
paper
contains
some
information
about
Mr.
Grandcourt
's
will
,
an
abstract
of
a
part
he
wished
you
to
know
 
if
you
'll
be
good
enough
to
cast
your
eyes
over
it
.
<EOS>
But
there
is
something
I
had
to
say
by
way
of
introduction
 
which
I
hope
you
'll
pardon
me
for
,
if
it
's
not
quite
agreeable
.
"
<EOS>
Lush
found
that
he
was
behaving
better
than
he
had
expected
,
and
had
no
idea
<EOS>
how
insulting
he
made
himself
with
his
"
not
quite
agreeable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Say
what
you
have
to
say
without
apologizing
,
please
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
with
the
air
she
might
have
bestowed
on
a
dog
-
stealer
<EOS>
come
to
claim
a
reward
for
finding
the
dog
he
had
stolen
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
only
to
remind
you
of
something
that
occurred
before
your
engagement
to
Mr.
Grandcourt
,
"
said
Lush
,
not
without
the
rise
of
some
willing
insolence
in
exchange
for
her
scorn
.
<EOS>
"
You
met
a
lady
in
Cardell
Chase
,
if
you
remember
,
who
spoke
to
you
of
her
position
with
regard
to
Mr.
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
She
had
children
with
her
 
one
a
very
fine
boy
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
lips
were
almost
as
pale
as
her
cheeks
;
her
passion
had
no
weapons
 
<EOS>
words
were
no
better
than
chips
.
<EOS>
This
man
's
speech
was
like
a
sharp
knife
-
edge
drawn
across
her
skin
:
but
even
her
indignation
at
the
employment
of
Lush
was
getting
merged
in
a
crowd
of
other
feelings
,
dim
and
alarming
as
a
crowd
of
ghosts
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Grandcourt
was
aware
that
you
were
acquainted
with
this
unfortunate
affair
beforehand
,
and
he
thinks
it
only
right
that
his
position
and
intentions
should
be
made
quite
clear
to
you
.
<EOS>
It
is
an
affair
of
property
and
prospects
;
and
if
there
were
any
objection
you
had
to
make
,
if
you
would
mention
it
to
me
 
<EOS>
it
is
a
subject
which
of
course
he
would
rather
not
speak
about
himself
 
if
you
will
be
good
enough
just
to

With
the
last
words
Lush
rose
and
presented
the
paper
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
When
Gwendolen
resolved
that
she
would
betray
no
feeling
in
the
presence
of
this
man
,
she
had
not
prepared
herself
to
hear
that
her
husband
knew
the
silent
consciousness
,
the
silently
accepted
terms
on
which
she
had
married
him
.
<EOS>
She
dared
not
raise
her
hand
to
take
the
paper
,
least
it
should
visibly
tremble
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
Lush
stood
holding
it
toward
her
,
and
she
felt
his
gaze
on
her
as
ignominy
,
before
she
could
say
even
with
low
-
toned
haughtiness
    
<EOS>
"
Lay
it
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
And
go
into
the
next
room
,
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lush
obeyed
,
thinking
as
he
took
an
easy
-
chair
in
the
back
drawing
-
room
,
"
My
lady
winces
considerably
.
<EOS>
She
did
n't
know
what
would
be
the
charge
for
that
superfine
article
,
Henleigh
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
penniless
girl
had
done
better
than
she
had
any
right
to
expect
,
and
that
she
had
been
uncommonly
knowing
for
her
years
and
opportunities
:
her
words
to
Lydia
meant
nothing
,
and
her
running
away
had
probably
been
part
of
her
adroitness
.
<EOS>
It
had
turned
out
a
master
-
stroke
.
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
Gwendolen
was
rallying
her
nerves
to
the
reading
of
the
paper
.
<EOS>
She
must
read
it
.
<EOS>
Her
whole
being
 
pride
,
longing
for
rebellion
,
<EOS>
dreams
of
freedom
,
remorseful
conscience
,
dread
of
fresh
visitation
 
<EOS>
all
made
one
need
to
know
what
the
paper
contained
.
<EOS>
But
at
first
it
was
not
easy
to
take
in
the
meaning
of
the
words
.
<EOS>
When
she
had
succeeded
,
she
found
that
in
the
case
of
there
being
no
son
as
issue
of
her
marriage
,
Grandcourt
had
made
the
small
Henleigh
his
heir
;
that
was
all
she
cared
to
extract
from
the
paper
with
any
distinctness
.
<EOS>
The
other
statement
as
to
what
provision
would
be
made
for
her
in
the
same
case
<EOS>
,
she
hurried
over
,
getting
only
a
confused
perception
of
thousands
and
Gadsmere
.
<EOS>
It
was
enough
.
<EOS>
She
could
dismiss
the
man
in
the
next
room
with
the
defiant
energy
which
had
revived
in
her
at
the
idea
that
this
question
of
property
and
inheritance
was
meant
as
a
finish
to
her
humiliations
and
her
thraldom
.
  
<EOS>
She
thrust
the
paper
between
the
leaves
of
her
book
,
which
she
took
in
her
hand
,
and
walked
with
her
stateliest
air
into
the
next
room
,
where
Lush
immediately
arose
,
awaiting
her
approach
.
<EOS>
When
she
was
four
yards
from
him
,
it
was
hardly
an
instant
that
she
paused
to
say
in
a
high
tone
,
while
she
swept
him
with
her
eyelashes
    
<EOS>
"
Tell
Mr.
Grandcourt
that
his
arrangements
are
just
what
I
desired
"
 
passing
on
without
haste
,
and
leaving
Lush
time
to
mingle
some
admiration
of
her
graceful
back
with
that
half
-
amused
sense
of
her
spirit
and
impertinence
,
which
he
expressed
by
raising
his
eyebrows
and
just
thrusting
his
tongue
between
his
teeth
.
<EOS>
He
really
did
not
want
her
to
be
worse
punished
,
and
he
was
glad
to
think
that
it
was
time
to
go
and
lunch
at
the
club
,
where
he
meant
to
have
a
lobster
salad
.
  
<EOS>
What
did
Gwendolen
look
forward
to
?
<EOS>
When
her
husband
returned
he
found
her
equipped
in
her
riding
-
dress
,
ready
to
ride
out
with
him
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
again
going
to
be
hysterical
,
or
take
to
her
bed
and
say
she
was
ill
.
<EOS>
That
was
the
implicit
resolve
adjusting
her
muscles
before
she
could
have
framed
it
in
words
,
as
she
walked
out
of
the
room
,
leaving
Lush
behind
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
going
to
act
in
the
spirit
of
her
message
,
and
not
to
give
herself
time
to
reflect
.
<EOS>
She
rang
the
bell
for
her
maid
,
and
went
with
the
usual
care
through
her
change
of
toilet
.
<EOS>
Doubtless
her
husband
had
meant
to
produce
a
great
effect
on
her
:
by
-
and
-
by
<EOS>
perhaps
she
would
let
him
see
an
effect
the
very
opposite
of
what
he
intended
;
but
at
present
all
that
she
could
show
was
a
defiant
satisfaction
in
what
had
been
presumed
to
be
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
It
came
as
an
instinct
rather
than
a
thought
,
that
to
show
any
sign
which
could
be
interpreted
as
jealousy
,
when
she
had
just
been
insultingly
reminded
that
the
conditions
were
what
she
had
accepted
with
her
eyes
open
,
would
be
the
worst
self
-
humiliation
.
<EOS>
She
said
to
herself
that
she
had
not
time
to
-
day
to
be
clear
about
her
future
actions
;
all
she
could
be
clear
about
was
that
she
would
match
her
husband
in
ignoring
any
ground
for
excitement
.
<EOS>
She
not
only
rode
,
but
went
out
with
him
to
dine
,
contributing
nothing
to
alter
their
mutual
manner
,
which
was
never
that
of
rapid
interchange
in
discourse
;
and
curiously
enough
she
rejected
a
handkerchief
on
which
her
maid
had
by
mistake
put
the
wrong
scent
 
a
scent
that
Grandcourt
had
once
objected
to
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
would
not
have
liked
to
be
an
object
of
disgust
to
this
husband
whom
she
hated
:
she
liked
all
disgust
to
be
on
her
side
.
  
<EOS>
But
to
defer
thought
in
this
way
was
something
like
trying
to
talk
without
singing
in
her
own
ears
.
<EOS>
The
thought
that
is
bound
up
with
our
passion
is
as
penetrative
as
air
 
<EOS>
everything
is
porous
to
it
;
bows
,
smiles
,
conversation
,
repartee
,
are
mere
honeycombs
where
such
thoughts
rushes
freely
,
not
always
with
a
taste
of
honey
.
<EOS>
And
without
shutting
herself
up
in
any
solitude
,
Gwendolen
seemed
at
the
end
of
nine
or
ten
hours
to
have
gone
through
a
labyrinth
of
reflection
,
in
which
already
the
same
succession
of
prospects
had
been
repeated
,
the
same
fallacious
outlets
rejected
,
the
same
shrinking
from
the
necessities
of
every
course
.
<EOS>
Already
she
was
undergoing
some
hardening
effect
from
feeling
that
she
was
under
eyes
which
saw
her
past
actions
solely
in
the
light
of
her
lowest
motives
.
<EOS>
She
lived
back
in
the
scenes
of
her
courtship
,
with
the
new
bitter
consciousness
of
what
had
been
in
Grandcourt
's
mind
 
certain
now
,
with
her
present
experience
of
him
,
that
he
had
a
peculiar
triumph
in
conquering
her
dumb
repugnance
,
and
that
ever
since
their
marriage
he
had
had
a
cold
exultation
in
knowing
her
fancied
secret
.
<EOS>
Her
imagination
exaggerated
every
tyrannical
impulse
<EOS>
he
was
capable
of
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
insist
on
being
separated
from
him
"
 
<EOS>
was
her
first
darting
determination
;
then
,
"
I
will
leave
him
whether
he
consents
or
not
.
<EOS>
If
this
boy
becomes
his
heir
,
I
have
made
an
atonement
.
"
<EOS>
But
neither
in
darkness
nor
in
daylight
could
she
imagine
the
scenes
which
must
carry
out
those
determinations
with
the
courage
to
feel
them
endurable
.
<EOS>
How
could
she
run
away
to
her
own
family
 
carry
distress
among
them
,
and
render
herself
an
object
of
scandal
in
the
society
she
had
left
behind
her
?
<EOS>
What
future
lay
before
her
as
Mrs.
Grandcourt
gone
back
to
her
mother
,
who
would
be
made
destitute
again
by
the
rupture
of
the
marriage
for
which
one
chief
excuse
had
been
that
it
had
brought
that
mother
a
maintenance
?
<EOS>
She
had
lately
been
seeing
her
uncle
and
Anna
in
London
,
and
though
she
had
been
saved
from
any
difficulty
about
inviting
them
to
stay
in
Grosvenor
Square
by
their
wish
to
be
with
Rex
,
who
would
not
risk
a
meeting
with
her
,
the
transient
visit
she
had
had
from
them
helped
now
in
giving
stronger
color
to
the
picture
of
what
it
would
be
for
her
to
take
refuge
in
her
own
family
.
<EOS>
What
could
she
say
to
justify
her
flight
?
<EOS>
Her
uncle
would
tell
her
to
go
back
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
would
cry
.
<EOS>
Her
aunt
and
Anna
would
look
at
her
with
wondering
alarm
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
would
have
power
to
compel
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
absolutely
nothing
that
she
could
allege
against
him
in
judicious
or
judicial
ears
.
<EOS>
And
to
"
insist
on
separation
!
<EOS>
"
That
was
an
easy
combination
of
words
;
but
considered
as
an
action
to
be
executed
against
Grandcourt
,
it
would
be
about
as
practicable
as
to
give
him
a
pliant
disposition
and
a
dread
of
other
people
's
unwillingness
.
<EOS>
How
was
she
to
begin
?
<EOS>
What
was
she
to
say
that
would
not
be
a
condemnation
of
herself
?
<EOS>
"
If
I
am
to
have
misery
anyhow
,
"
was
the
bitter
refrain
of
her
rebellious
dreams
,
"
I
had
better
have
the
misery
that
I
can
keep
to
myself
.
"
<EOS>
Moreover
,
her
capability
of
rectitude
told
her
again
and
again
that
she
had
no
right
to
complain
of
her
contract
,
or
to
withdraw
from
it
.
  
<EOS>
And
always
among
the
images
that
drove
her
back
to
submission
<EOS>
was
Deronda
.
<EOS>
The
idea
of
herself
separated
from
her
husband
,
gave
Deronda
a
changed
,
perturbing
,
painful
place
in
her
consciousness
:
instinctively
she
felt
that
the
separation
would
be
from
him
too
,
and
in
the
prospective
vision
of
herself
as
a
solitary
,
dubiously
-
regarded
woman
,
she
felt
some
tingling
bashfulness
at
the
remembrance
of
her
behavior
towards
him
.
<EOS>
The
association
of
Deronda
with
a
dubious
position
for
herself
was
intolerable
.
<EOS>
And
what
would
he
say
if
he
knew
everything
?
<EOS>
Probably
that
she
ought
to
bear
what
she
had
brought
on
herself
,
unless
she
were
sure
that
she
could
make
herself
a
better
woman
by
taking
any
other
course
.
<EOS>
And
what
sort
of
woman
was
she
to
be
 
solitary
,
sickened
of
life
,
<EOS>
looked
at
with
a
suspicious
kind
of
pity
?
 
<EOS>
even
if
she
could
dream
of
success
in
getting
that
dreary
freedom
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grandcourt
"
run
away
"
would
be
a
more
pitiable
creature
than
Gwendolen
Harleth
condemned
to
teach
the
bishop
's
daughters
,
and
to
be
inspected
by
Mrs.
Mompert
.
  
<EOS>
One
characteristic
trait
in
her
conduct
is
worth
mentioning
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
look
a
second
time
at
the
paper
Lush
had
given
her
;
and
before
ringing
for
her
maid
<EOS>
she
locked
it
up
in
a
traveling
-
desk
which
was
at
hand
,
proudly
resolved
against
curiosity
about
what
was
allotted
to
herself
in
connection
with
Gadsmere
 
feeling
herself
branded
in
the
minds
of
her
husband
and
his
confidant
with
the
meanness
that
would
accept
marriage
and
wealth
on
any
conditions
,
however
dishonorable
and
humiliating
.
  
<EOS>
Day
after
day
the
same
pattern
of
thinking
was
repeated
.
<EOS>
There
came
nothing
to
change
the
situation
 
<EOS>
no
new
elements
in
the
sketch
 
only
a
recurrence
which
engraved
it
.
<EOS>
The
May
weeks
went
on
into
June
,
and
still
Mrs.
Grandcourt
was
outwardly
in
the
same
place
,
presenting
herself
as
she
was
expected
to
do
in
the
accustomed
scenes
,
with
the
accustomed
grace
,
beauty
,
and
costume
;
from
church
at
one
end
of
the
week
,
through
all
the
scale
of
desirable
receptions
,
to
opera
at
the
other
.
<EOS>
Church
was
not
markedly
distinguished
in
her
mind
from
the
other
forms
of
self
-
presentation
,
for
marriage
had
included
no
instruction
that
enabled
her
to
connect
liturgy
and
sermon
with
any
larger
order
of
the
world
than
that
of
unexplained
and
perhaps
inexplicable
social
fashions
.
<EOS>
While
a
laudable
zeal
was
laboring
to
carry
the
light
of
spiritual
law
up
the
alleys
where
law
is
chiefly
known
as
the
policeman
,
the
brilliant
Mrs.
Grandcourt
,
condescending
a
little
to
a
fashionable
rector
and
conscious
of
a
feminine
advantage
over
a
learned
dean
,
<EOS>
was
,
so
far
as
pastoral
care
and
religious
fellowship
were
concerned
,
in
as
complete
a
solitude
as
a
man
in
a
lighthouse
.
  
<EOS>
Can
we
wonder
at
the
practical
submission
which
hid
her
constructive
rebellion
?
<EOS>
The
combination
is
common
enough
,
as
we
know
from
the
number
of
persons
who
make
us
aware
of
it
in
their
own
case
by
a
clamorous
unwearied
statement
of
the
reasons
against
their
submitting
to
a
situation
which
,
on
inquiry
,
we
discover
to
be
the
least
disagreeable
within
their
reach
.
<EOS>
Poor
Gwendolen
had
both
too
much
and
too
little
mental
power
and
dignity
to
make
herself
exceptional
.
<EOS>
No
wonder
that
Deronda
now
marked
some
hardening
in
a
look
and
manner
which
were
schooled
daily
to
the
suppression
of
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
For
example
.
<EOS>
One
morning
,
riding
in
Rotten
Row
with
Grandcourt
by
her
side
,
she
saw
standing
against
the
railing
at
the
turn
,
just
facing
them
,
a
dark
-
eyed
lady
with
a
little
girl
and
a
blonde
boy
,
whom
she
at
once
recognized
as
the
beings
in
all
the
world
the
most
painful
for
her
to
behold
.
<EOS>
She
and
Grandcourt
had
just
slackened
their
pace
to
a
walk
;
he
being
on
the
outer
side
was
the
nearer
to
the
unwelcome
vision
,
and
Gwendolen
had
not
presence
of
mind
to
do
anything
but
glance
away
from
the
dark
eyes
that
met
hers
piercingly
toward
Grandcourt
,
who
wheeled
past
the
group
with
an
unmoved
face
,
giving
no
sign
of
recognition
.
  
<EOS>
Immediately
she
felt
a
rising
rage
against
him
mingling
with
her
shame
for
herself
,
and
the
words
,
"
You
might
at
least
have
raised
your
hat
to
her
,
"
flew
impetuously
to
her
lips
 
but
did
not
pass
them
.
<EOS>
If
as
her
husband
,
in
her
company
,
he
chose
to
ignore
these
creatures
whom
she
herself
had
excluded
from
the
place
she
was
filling
,
how
could
she
be
the
person
to
reproach
him
?
<EOS>
She
was
dumb
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
chance
,
but
<EOS>
her
own
design
,
that
had
brought
Mrs.
Glasher
there
with
her
boy
.
<EOS>
She
had
come
to
town
under
the
pretext
of
making
purchases
 
really
wanting
educational
apparatus
for
her
children
,
and
had
had
interviews
with
Lush
in
which
she
had
not
refused
to
soothe
her
uneasy
mind
by
representing
the
probabilities
as
all
on
the
side
of
her
ultimate
triumph
.
<EOS>
Let
her
keep
quiet
,
and
she
might
live
to
see
the
marriage
dissolve
itself
in
one
way
or
other
 
Lush
hinted
at
several
ways
 
leaving
the
succession
assured
to
her
boy
.
<EOS>
She
had
had
an
interview
with
Grandcourt
,
too
,
who
had
as
usual
told
her
to
behave
like
a
reasonable
woman
,
and
threatened
punishment
if
she
were
troublesome
;
but
had
,
also
as
usual
,
vindicated
himself
from
any
wish
to
be
stingy
,
the
money
he
was
receiving
from
Sir
Hugo
on
account
of
Diplow
encouraging
him
to
be
lavish
.
<EOS>
Lydia
,
feeding
on
the
probabilities
in
her
favor
,
devoured
her
helpless
wrath
along
with
that
pleasanter
nourishment
;
but
she
could
not
let
her
discretion
go
entirely
without
the
reward
of
making
a
Medusa
-
apparition
before
Gwendolen
,
vindictiveness
and
jealousy
finding
relief
in
an
outlet
of
venom
,
though
it
were
as
futile
as
that
of
a
viper
already
flung
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
.
<EOS>
Hence
,
each
day
,
after
finding
out
from
Lush
the
likely
time
for
Gwendolen
to
be
riding
,
she
had
watched
at
that
post
,
daring
Grandcourt
so
far
.
<EOS>
Why
should
she
not
take
little
Henleigh
into
the
Park
?
  
<EOS>
The
Medusa
-
apparition
was
made
effective
beyond
Lydia
's
conception
by
the
shock
it
gave
Gwendolen
actually
to
see
Grandcourt
ignoring
this
woman
who
had
once
been
the
nearest
in
the
world
to
him
,
along
with
the
children
she
had
borne
him
.
<EOS>
And
all
the
while
the
dark
shadow
thus
cast
on
the
lot
of
a
woman
destitute
of
acknowledged
social
dignity
,
spread
itself
over
her
visions
of
a
future
that
might
be
her
own
,
and
made
part
of
her
dread
on
her
own
behalf
.
<EOS>
She
shrank
all
the
more
from
any
lonely
action
.
<EOS>
What
possible
release
could
there
be
for
her
from
this
hated
vantage
ground
,
which
yet
she
dared
not
quit
,
any
more
than
if
fire
had
been
raining
outside
it
?
<EOS>
What
release
,
but
death
?
<EOS>
Not
her
own
death
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
was
not
a
woman
who
could
easily
think
of
her
own
death
as
a
near
reality
,
or
front
for
herself
the
dark
entrance
on
the
untried
and
invisible
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
more
possible
that
Grandcourt
should
die
:
 
and
yet
not
likely
.
<EOS>
The
power
of
tyranny
in
him
seemed
a
power
of
living
in
the
presence
of
any
wish
that
he
should
die
.
<EOS>
The
thought
that
his
death
was
the
only
possible
deliverance
for
her
was
one
with
the
thought
that
deliverance
would
never
come
 
the
double
deliverance
from
the
injury
with
which
other
beings
might
reproach
her
and
from
the
yoke
she
had
brought
on
her
own
neck
.
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
she
foresaw
him
always
living
,
and
her
own
life
dominated
by
him
;
the
"
always
"
of
her
young
experience
not
stretching
beyond
the
few
immediate
years
that
seemed
immeasurably
long
with
her
passionate
weariness
.
<EOS>
The
thought
of
his
dying
would
not
subsist
:
it
turned
as
with
a
dream
-
change
into
the
terror
that
she
should
die
with
his
throttling
fingers
on
her
neck
avenging
that
thought
.
<EOS>
Fantasies
moved
within
her
like
ghosts
,
making
no
break
in
her
more
acknowledged
consciousness
and
finding
no
obstruction
in
it
:
dark
rays
doing
their
work
invisibly
in
the
broad
light
.
  
<EOS>
Only
an
evening
or
two
after
that
encounter
in
the
Park
,
there
was
a
grand
concert
at
Klesmer
's
,
who
was
living
rather
magnificently
now
in
one
of
the
large
houses
in
Grosvenor
Place
,
a
patron
and
prince
among
musical
professors
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
had
looked
forward
to
this
occasion
as
one
on
which
she
was
sure
to
meet
Deronda
,
and
she
had
been
meditating
how
to
put
a
question
to
him
which
,
without
containing
a
word
that
she
would
feel
a
dislike
to
utter
,
would
yet
be
explicit
enough
for
him
to
understand
it
.
<EOS>
The
struggle
of
opposite
feelings
would
not
let
her
abide
by
her
instinct
that
the
very
idea
of
Deronda
's
relation
to
her
was
a
discouragement
to
any
desperate
step
towards
freedom
.
<EOS>
The
next
wave
of
emotion
was
a
longing
for
some
word
of
his
to
enforce
a
resolve
.
<EOS>
The
fact
that
her
opportunities
of
conversation
with
him
had
always
to
be
snatched
in
the
doubtful
privacy
of
large
parties
,
caused
her
to
live
through
them
many
times
beforehand
,
imagining
how
they
would
take
place
and
what
she
would
say
.
<EOS>
The
irritation
was
proportionate
when
no
opportunity
came
;
and
this
evening
at
Klesmer
's
she
included
Deronda
in
her
anger
,
because
he
looked
as
calm
as
possible
at
a
distance
from
her
,
while
she
was
in
danger
of
betraying
her
impatience
to
every
one
who
spoke
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
found
her
only
safety
in
a
chill
haughtiness
which
made
Mr.
Vandernoodt
remark
that
Mrs.
Grandcourt
was
becoming
a
perfect
match
for
her
husband
.
<EOS>
When
at
last
the
chances
of
the
evening
brought
Deronda
near
her
,
Sir
Hugo
and
Mrs.
Raymond
were
close
by
and
could
hear
every
word
she
said
.
<EOS>
No
matter
:
her
husband
was
not
near
,
and
her
irritation
passed
without
check
into
a
fit
of
daring
which
restored
the
security
of
her
self
-
possession
.
<EOS>
Deronda
was
there
at
last
,
and
she
would
compel
him
to
do
what
she
pleased
.
<EOS>
Already
and
without
effort
rather
queenly
in
her
air
as
she
stood
in
her
white
lace
and
green
leaves
she
threw
a
royal
permissiveness
into
her
way
of
saying
,
"
I
wish
you
would
come
and
see
me
to
-
morrow
between
five
and
six
,
Mr.
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
could
be
but
one
answer
at
that
moment
:
"
Certainly
,
"
with
a
tone
of
obedience
.
  
<EOS>
Afterward
it
occurred
to
Deronda
that
he
would
write
a
note
to
excuse
himself
.
<EOS>
He
had
always
avoided
making
a
call
at
Grandcourt
's
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
persuade
himself
to
any
step
that
might
hurt
her
,
and
whether
his
excuse
were
taken
for
indifference
or
for
the
affectation
of
indifference
it
would
be
equally
wounding
.
<EOS>
He
kept
his
promise
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
had
declined
to
ride
out
on
the
plea
of
not
feeling
well
enough
having
left
her
refusal
to
the
last
moment
when
the
horses
were
soon
to
be
at
the
door
 
not
without
alarm
lest
her
husband
should
say
that
he
too
would
stay
at
home
.
<EOS>
Become
almost
superstitious
about
his
power
of
suspicious
divination
,
she
had
a
glancing
forethought
of
what
she
would
do
in
that
case
 
namely
,
have
herself
denied
as
not
well
.
<EOS>
But
Grandcourt
accepted
her
excuse
without
remark
,
and
rode
off
.
  
<EOS>
Nevertheless
when
Gwendolen
found
herself
alone
,
and
had
sent
down
the
order
that
only
Mr.
Deronda
was
to
be
admitted
,
she
began
to
be
alarmed
at
what
she
had
done
,
and
to
feel
a
growing
agitation
in
the
thought
that
he
would
soon
appear
,
and
she
should
soon
be
obliged
to
speak
:
not
of
trivialities
,
as
if
she
had
no
serious
motive
in
asking
him
to
come
:
and
yet
what
she
had
been
for
hours
determining
to
say
began
to
seem
impossible
.
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
the
impulse
of
appeal
to
him
was
being
checked
by
timidity
,
and
now
that
it
was
too
late
she
was
shaken
by
the
possibility
that
he
might
think
her
invitation
unbecoming
.
<EOS>
If
so
,
she
would
have
sunk
in
his
esteem
.
<EOS>
But
immediately
she
resisted
this
intolerable
fear
as
an
infection
from
her
husband
's
way
of
thinking
.
<EOS>
That
_
he
_
would
say
she
was
making
a
fool
of
herself
was
rather
a
reason
why
such
a
judgment
would
be
remote
from
Deronda
's
mind
.
<EOS>
But
that
she
could
not
rid
herself
from
this
sudden
invasion
of
womanly
reticence
<EOS>
was
manifest
in
a
kind
of
action
which
had
never
occurred
to
her
before
.
<EOS>
In
her
struggle
between
agitation
and
the
effort
to
suppress
it
,
she
was
walking
up
and
down
the
length
of
the
two
drawing
-
rooms
,
where
at
one
end
a
long
mirror
reflected
her
in
her
black
dress
,
chosen
in
the
early
morning
with
a
half
-
admitted
reference
to
this
hour
.
<EOS>
But
above
this
black
dress
her
head
on
its
white
pillar
of
a
neck
showed
to
advantage
.
<EOS>
Some
consciousness
of
this
made
her
turn
hastily
and
hurry
to
the
boudoir
,
where
again
there
was
a
glass
,
but
also
,
tossed
over
a
chair
,
<EOS>
a
large
piece
of
black
lace
which
she
snatched
and
tied
over
her
crown
of
hair
so
as
completely
to
conceal
her
neck
,
and
leave
only
her
face
looking
out
from
the
black
frame
.
<EOS>
In
this
manifest
contempt
of
appearance
,
she
thought
it
possible
to
be
freer
from
nervousness
,
but
the
black
lace
did
not
take
away
the
uneasiness
from
her
eyes
and
lips
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
when
Deronda
was
announced
,
and
as
he
approached
her
<EOS>
she
perceived
that
he
too
for
some
reason
<EOS>
was
not
his
usual
self
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
have
defined
the
change
except
by
saying
that
he
looked
less
happy
than
usual
,
and
appeared
to
be
under
some
effort
in
speaking
to
her
.
<EOS>
And
yet
the
speaking
was
the
slightest
possible
.
<EOS>
They
both
said
,
"
How
do
you
do
?
"
quite
curtly
;
and
Gwendolen
,
instead
of
sitting
down
,
moved
to
a
little
distance
,
resting
her
arms
slightly
on
the
tall
back
of
a
chair
,
while
Deronda
stood
where
he
was
,
 
both
feeling
it
difficult
to
say
any
more
,
though
the
preoccupation
in
his
mind
could
hardly
have
been
more
remote
than
it
was
from
Gwendolen
's
conception
.
<EOS>
She
naturally
saw
in
his
embarrassment
some
reflection
of
her
own
.
<EOS>
Forced
to
speak
,
she
found
all
her
training
in
concealment
and
self
-
command
of
no
use
to
her
and
began
with
timid
awkwardness
    
<EOS>
"
You
will
wonder
why
I
begged
you
to
come
.
<EOS>
I
wanted
to
ask
you
something
.
<EOS>
You
said
I
was
ignorant
.
<EOS>
That
is
true
.
<EOS>
And
what
can
I
do
but
ask
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
And
at
this
moment
she
was
feeling
it
utterly
impossible
to
put
the
questions
she
had
intended
.
<EOS>
Something
new
in
her
nervous
manner
roused
Deronda
's
anxiety
lest
there
might
be
a
new
crisis
.
<EOS>
He
said
with
the
sadness
of
affection
in
his
voice
    
<EOS>
"
My
only
regret
is
,
that
I
can
be
of
so
little
use
to
you
.
"
<EOS>
The
words
and
the
tone
touched
a
new
spring
in
her
,
and
she
went
on
with
more
sense
of
freedom
,
yet
still
not
saying
anything
she
had
designed
to
say
,
and
beginning
to
hurry
,
that
she
might
somehow
arrive
at
the
right
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wanted
to
tell
you
that
I
have
always
been
thinking
of
your
advice
,
but
is
it
any
use
?
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
make
myself
different
,
because
things
about
me
raise
bad
feelings
 
<EOS>
and
I
must
go
on
 
<EOS>
I
can
alter
nothing
 
<EOS>
it
is
no
use
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
paused
an
instant
,
with
the
consciousness
that
she
was
not
finding
the
right
words
,
but
began
again
hurriedly
,
"
<EOS>
But
if
I
go
on
I
shall
get
worse
.
<EOS>
I
want
not
to
get
worse
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
be
what
you
wish
.
<EOS>
There
are
people
who
are
good
and
enjoy
great
things
 
<EOS>
I
know
there
are
.
<EOS>
I
am
a
contemptible
creature
.
<EOS>
I
feel
as
if
I
should
get
wicked
with
hating
people
.
<EOS>
I
have
tried
to
think
that
I
would
go
away
from
everybody
.
<EOS>
But
I
ca
n't
.
<EOS>
There
are
so
many
things
to
hinder
me
.
<EOS>
You
think
,
perhaps
,
that
I
do
n't
mind
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
mind
.
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
of
everything
.
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
of
getting
wicked
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
what
I
can
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
had
forgotten
everything
but
<EOS>
that
image
of
her
helpless
misery
which
she
was
trying
to
make
present
to
Deronda
in
broken
allusive
speech
 
wishing
to
convey
but
not
express
all
her
need
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
were
tearless
,
and
had
a
look
of
smarting
in
their
dilated
brilliancy
;
there
was
a
subdued
sob
in
her
voice
which
was
more
and
more
veiled
,
till
it
was
hardly
above
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
She
was
hurting
herself
with
the
jewels
that
glittered
on
her
tightly
-
clasped
fingers
pressed
against
her
heart
.
  
<EOS>
The
feeling
Deronda
endured
in
these
moments
he
afterward
called
horrible
.
<EOS>
Words
seemed
to
have
no
more
rescue
in
them
than
if
he
had
been
beholding
a
vessel
in
peril
of
wreck
 
<EOS>
the
poor
ship
with
its
many
-
lived
anguish
beaten
by
the
inescapable
storm
.
<EOS>
How
could
he
grasp
the
long
-
growing
process
of
this
young
creature
's
wretchedness
?
 
<EOS>
how
arrest
and
change
it
with
a
sentence
?
<EOS>
He
was
afraid
of
his
own
voice
.
<EOS>
The
words
that
rushed
into
his
mind
seemed
in
their
feebleness
nothing
better
than
despair
made
audible
,
or
than
that
insensibility
to
another
's
hardship
which
applies
precept
to
soothe
pain
.
<EOS>
He
felt
himself
holding
a
crowd
of
words
imprisoned
within
his
lips
,
as
if
the
letting
them
escape
would
be
a
violation
of
awe
before
the
mysteries
of
our
human
lot
.
<EOS>
The
thought
that
urged
itself
foremost
was
 
"
Confess
everything
to
your
husband
;
have
nothing
concealed
:
"
 
the
words
carried
in
his
mind
a
vision
of
reasons
which
would
have
needed
much
fuller
expressions
for
Gwendolen
to
apprehend
them
,
<EOS>
but
before
he
had
begun
those
brief
sentences
,
the
door
opened
and
the
husband
entered
.
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
had
deliberately
gone
out
and
turned
back
to
satisfy
a
suspicion
.
<EOS>
What
he
saw
was
Gwendolen
's
face
of
anguish
framed
black
like
a
nun
's
,
and
Deronda
standing
three
yards
from
her
with
a
look
of
sorrow
such
as
he
might
have
bent
on
the
last
struggle
of
life
in
a
beloved
object
.
<EOS>
Without
any
show
of
surprise
Grandcourt
nodded
to
Deronda
,
gave
a
second
look
at
Gwendolen
,
passed
on
,
and
seated
himself
easily
at
a
little
distance
crossing
his
legs
,
taking
out
his
handkerchief
and
trifling
with
it
elegantly
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
had
shrunk
and
changed
her
attitude
on
seeing
him
,
but
she
did
not
turn
or
move
from
her
place
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
a
moment
in
which
she
could
feign
anything
,
or
manifest
any
strong
revulsion
of
feeling
:
the
passionate
movement
of
her
last
speech
was
still
too
strong
within
her
.
<EOS>
What
she
felt
beside
was
a
dull
despairing
sense
that
her
interview
with
Deronda
was
at
an
end
:
a
curtain
had
fallen
.
<EOS>
But
he
,
naturally
,
was
urged
into
self
-
possession
and
effort
by
susceptibility
to
what
might
follow
for
her
from
being
seen
by
her
husband
in
this
betrayal
of
agitation
;
and
feeling
that
any
pretence
of
ease
in
prolonging
his
visit
would
only
exaggerate
Grandcourt
's
possible
conjectures
of
duplicity
<EOS>
,
he
merely
said
    
"
I
will
not
stay
longer
now
.
<EOS>
Good
bye
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
put
out
his
hand
,
and
she
let
him
press
her
poor
little
chill
fingers
;
but
she
said
no
good
-
bye
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
had
left
the
room
,
Gwendolen
threw
herself
into
a
seat
,
with
an
expectation
as
dull
as
her
despair
 
<EOS>
the
expectation
that
she
was
going
to
be
punished
.
<EOS>
But
Grandcourt
took
no
notice
:
he
was
satisfied
to
have
let
her
know
that
she
had
not
deceived
him
,
and
to
keep
a
silence
which
was
formidable
with
omniscience
.
<EOS>
He
went
out
that
evening
,
and
her
plea
of
feeling
ill
was
accepted
without
even
a
sneer
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
morning
at
breakfast
he
said
,
"
I
am
going
yachting
to
the
Mediterranean
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
?
"
said
Gwendolen
,
with
a
leap
of
heart
which
had
hope
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
day
after
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
The
yacht
is
at
Marseilles
.
<EOS>
Lush
is
gone
to
get
everything
ready
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
have
mamma
to
stay
with
me
,
then
?
"
said
Gwendolen
,
the
new
sudden
possibility
of
peace
and
affection
filling
her
mind
like
a
burst
of
morning
light
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
you
will
go
with
me
.
"
            
<EOS>
Ever
in
his
soul
  
<EOS>
That
larger
justice
which
makes
gratitude
  
Triumphed
above
resentment
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
<EOS>
the
mark
  
Of
regal
natures
,
with
the
wider
life
.
  
<EOS>
And
fuller
capability
of
joy
:
    
Not
wits
exultant
in
the
strongest
lens
  
<EOS>
To
show
you
goodness
vanished
into
pulp
  
<EOS>
Never
worth
"
thank
you
"
 
<EOS>
they
're
the
devil
's
friars
,
  
Vowed
to
be
poor
as
he
in
love
and
trust
,
  
<EOS>
Yet
must
go
begging
of
a
world
that
keeps
  
Some
human
property
.
   
<EOS>
Deronda
,
in
parting
from
Gwendolen
,
had
abstained
from
saying
,
"
I
shall
not
see
you
again
for
a
long
while
:
I
am
going
away
,
"
lest
Grandcourt
should
understand
him
to
imply
that
the
fact
was
of
importance
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
actually
going
away
under
circumstances
so
momentous
to
himself
that
when
he
set
out
to
fulfill
his
promise
of
calling
on
her
,
he
was
already
under
the
shadow
of
a
solemn
emotion
which
revived
the
deepest
experience
of
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
had
sent
for
him
to
his
chambers
with
the
note
 
<EOS>
"
Come
immediately
.
<EOS>
Something
has
happened
:
"
a
preparation
that
caused
him
some
relief
when
,
on
entering
the
baronet
's
study
,
he
was
received
with
grave
affection
instead
of
the
distress
which
he
had
apprehended
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
nothing
to
grieve
you
,
sir
?
"
said
Deronda
,
in
a
tone
rather
of
restored
confidence
than
question
,
as
he
took
the
hand
held
out
to
him
.
<EOS>
There
was
an
unusual
meaning
in
Sir
Hugo
's
look
,
and
a
subdued
emotion
in
his
voice
,
as
he
said
    
"
No
,
Dan
,
no
.
<EOS>
Sit
down
.
<EOS>
I
have
something
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
Deronda
obeyed
,
not
without
presentiment
.
<EOS>
It
was
extremely
rare
for
Sir
Hugo
to
show
so
much
serious
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
to
grieve
me
,
my
boy
,
no
.
<EOS>
At
least
,
if
there
is
nothing
in
it
that
will
grieve
you
too
much
.
<EOS>
But
I
hardly
expected
that
this
 
just
this
 
would
ever
happen
.
<EOS>
There
have
been
reasons
why
I
have
never
prepared
you
for
it
.
<EOS>
There
have
been
reasons
why
I
have
never
told
you
anything
about
your
parentage
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
striven
in
every
way
not
to
make
that
an
injury
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
paused
,
but
Deronda
could
not
speak
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
say
,
"
I
have
never
felt
it
an
injury
.
"
Even
if
that
had
been
true
,
he
could
not
have
trusted
his
voice
to
say
anything
.
<EOS>
Far
more
than
any
one
but
himself
could
know
of
was
hanging
on
this
moment
when
the
secrecy
was
to
be
broken
.
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
had
never
seen
the
grand
face
he
delighted
in
so
pale
 
<EOS>
the
lips
pressed
together
with
such
a
look
of
pain
.
<EOS>
He
went
on
with
a
more
anxious
tenderness
,
as
if
he
had
a
new
fear
of
wounding
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
acted
in
obedience
to
your
mother
's
wishes
.
<EOS>
The
secrecy
was
her
wish
.
<EOS>
But
now
she
desires
to
remove
it
.
<EOS>
She
desires
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
I
will
put
this
letter
into
your
hands
,
which
you
can
look
at
by
-
and
-
by
.
<EOS>
It
will
merely
tell
you
what
she
wishes
you
to
do
,
and
where
you
will
find
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
held
out
a
letter
written
on
foreign
paper
,
which
Deronda
thrust
into
his
breast
-
pocket
,
with
a
sense
of
relief
that
he
was
not
called
on
to
read
anything
immediately
.
<EOS>
The
emotion
on
Daniel
's
face
had
gained
on
the
baronet
,
and
was
visibly
shaking
his
composure
.
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
found
it
difficult
to
say
more
.
<EOS>
And
Deronda
's
whole
soul
was
possessed
by
a
question
which
was
the
hardest
in
the
world
to
utter
.
<EOS>
Yet
he
could
not
bear
to
delay
it
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
sacramental
moment
.
<EOS>
If
he
let
it
pass
,
he
could
not
recover
the
influences
under
which
it
was
possible
to
utter
the
words
and
meet
the
answer
.
<EOS>
For
some
moments
his
eyes
were
cast
down
,
and
it
seemed
to
both
as
if
thoughts
were
in
the
air
between
them
.
<EOS>
But
at
last
Deronda
looked
at
Sir
Hugo
,
and
said
,
with
a
tremulous
reverence
in
his
voice
 
dreading
to
convey
indirectly
the
reproach
that
affection
had
for
years
been
stifling
    
"
Is
my
father
also
living
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
answer
came
immediately
in
a
low
emphatic
tone
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
the
mingled
emotions
which
followed
that
answer
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
joy
from
pain
.
  
<EOS>
Some
new
light
had
fallen
on
the
past
for
Sir
Hugo
too
in
this
interview
.
<EOS>
After
a
silence
in
which
Deronda
felt
like
one
whose
creed
is
gone
before
he
has
religiously
embraced
another
,
the
baronet
said
,
in
a
tone
of
confession
    
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
was
wrong
,
Dan
,
to
undertake
what
I
did
.
<EOS>
And
perhaps
I
liked
it
a
little
too
well
 
<EOS>
having
you
all
to
myself
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
have
had
any
pain
which
I
might
have
helped
,
I
ask
you
to
forgive
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
forgiveness
has
long
been
there
,
"
said
Deronda
"
<EOS>
The
chief
pain
has
always
been
on
account
of
some
one
else
 
whom
I
never
knew
 
whom
I
am
now
to
know
.
<EOS>
It
has
not
hindered
me
from
feeling
an
affection
for
you
which
has
made
a
large
part
of
all
the
life
I
remember
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
seemed
one
impulse
that
made
the
two
men
clasp
each
other
's
hand
for
a
moment
.
    
<EOS>
THE
MOTHER
AND
THE
SON
          
<EOS>
"
If
some
mortal
,
born
too
soon
,
  
Were
laid
away
in
some
great
trance
 
the
ages
  
Coming
and
going
all
the
while
 
till
dawned
  
<EOS>
His
true
time
's
advent
;
and
could
then
record
  
<EOS>
The
words
they
spoke
who
kept
watch
by
his
bed
,
  
<EOS>
Then
I
might
tell
more
of
the
breath
<EOS>
so
light
  
<EOS>
Upon
my
eyelids
,
and
the
fingers
warm
  
Among
my
hair
.
<EOS>
Youth
is
confused
;
yet
never
  
<EOS>
So
dull
was
I
<EOS>
but
,
when
that
spirit
passed
,
  
I
turned
to
him
,
scarce
consciously
,
as
turns
  
A
water
-
snake
when
fairies
cross
his
sleep
.

This
was
the
letter
which
Sir
Hugo
put
into
Deronda
's
hands
:
        
TO
MY
SON
,
DANIEL
DERONDA
.
      
<EOS>
My
good
friend
and
yours
,
Sir
Hugo

,
will
have
told
you
that
    
I
wish
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
My
health
is
shaken
,
and
I
desire
there
should
be
    
<EOS>
no
time
lost
before
I
deliver
to
you
what
I
have
long
withheld

nothing

be
able
to
make
the
journey

be
staying

will
depend
on

unknown
mother

LEONORA

<EOS>
This
letter
with
its
colorless
wording
gave
Deronda
no
clue
to
what
was
in
reserve
for
him
;
but
he
could
not
do
otherwise
than
accept
Sir
Hugo
's
reticence
,
which
seemed
to
imply
some
pledge
not
to
anticipate
the
mother
's
disclosures
;
and
the
discovery
that
his
life
-
long
conjectures
had
been
mistaken
checked
further
surmise
.
<EOS>
Deronda
could
not
hinder
his
imagination
from
taking
a
quick
flight
over
what
seemed
possibilities
,
but
he
refused
to
contemplate
any
of
them
as
more
likely
than
another
,
lest
he
should
be
nursing
it
into
a
dominant
desire
or
repugnance
,
instead
of
simply
preparing
himself
with
resolve
to
meet
the
fact
bravely
,
whatever
it
might
turn
out
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
state
of
mind
he
could
not
have
communicated
to
any
one
the
reason
for
the
absence
which
in
some
quarters
he
was
obliged
to
mention
beforehand
,
least
of
all
to
Mordecai
,
whom
it
would
affect
as
powerfully
as
it
did
himself
,
only
in
rather
a
different
way
.
<EOS>
If
he
were
to
say
,
"
I
am
going
to
learn
the
truth
about
my
birth
,
"
Mordecai
's
hope
would
gather
what
might
prove
a
painful
,
dangerous
excitement
.
<EOS>
To
exclude
suppositions
,
he
spoke
of
his
journey
as
being
undertaken
by
Sir
Hugo
's
wish
,
and
threw
as
much
indifference
as
he
could
into
his
manner
of
announcing
it
,
saying
he
was
uncertain
of
its
duration
,
but
it
would
perhaps
be
very
short
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
ask
to
have
the
child
Jacob
to
stay
with
me
,
"
said
Mordecai
,
comforting
himself
in
this
way
,
after
the
first
mournful
glances
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
drive
round
and
ask
Mrs.
Cohen
to
let
him
come
,
"
said
Mirah
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
grandmother
will
deny
you
nothing
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
glad
you
were
a
little
wrong
as
well
as
I
,
"
he
added
,
smiling
at
Mordecai
.
<EOS>
"
You
thought
that
old
Mrs.
Cohen
would
not
bear
to
see
Mirah
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
undervalued
her
heart
,
"
said
Mordecai
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
capable
of
rejoicing
that
another
's
plant
blooms
though
her
own
be
withered
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
they
are
dear
good
people
;
I
feel
as
if
we
all
belonged
to
each
other
,
"
said
Mirah
,
with
a
tinge
of
merriment
in
her
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
should
you
have
felt
if
that
Ezra
had
been
your
brother
?
"
said
Deronda
,
mischievously
 
a
little
provoked
that
she
had
taken
kindly
at
once
to
people
who
had
caused
him
so
much
prospective
annoyance
on
her
account
.
  
<EOS>
Mirah
looked
at
him
with
a
slight
surprise
for
a
moment
,
and
then
said
,
"
He
is
not
a
bad
man
 
<EOS>
I
think
he
would
never
forsake
any
one
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
when
she
uttered
the
words
she
blushed
deeply
,
and
glancing
timidly
at
Mordecai
,
turned
away
to
some
occupation
.
<EOS>
Her
father
was
in
her
mind
,
and
this
was
a
subject
on
which
she
and
her
brother
had
a
painful
mutual
consciousness
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
should
come
and
find
us
!
"
was
a
thought
which
to
Mirah
sometimes
made
the
street
daylight
as
shadowy
as
a
haunted
forest
where
each
turn
screened
for
her
an
imaginary
apparition
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
felt
what
was
her
involuntary
allusion
,
and
understood
the
blush
.
<EOS>
How
could
he
be
slow
to
understand
feelings
which
now
seemed
nearer
than
ever
to
his
own
?
<EOS>
for
the
words
of
his
mother
's
letter
implied
that
his
filial
relation
was
not
to
be
freed
from
painful
conditions
;
indeed
,
singularly
enough
that
letter
which
had
brought
his
mother
nearer
as
a
living
reality
had
thrown
her
into
more
remoteness
for
his
affections
.
<EOS>
The
tender
yearning
after
a
being
whose
life
might
have
been
the
worse
for
not
having
his
care
and
love
,
the
image
of
a
mother
who
had
not
had
all
her
dues
,
whether
of
reverence
or
compassion
,
had
long
been
secretly
present
with
him
in
his
observation
of
all
the
women
he
had
come
near
.
<EOS>
But
it
seemed
now
that
this
picturing
of
his
mother
might
fit
the
facts
no
better
than
his
former
conceptions
about
Sir
Hugo
.
<EOS>
He
wondered
to
find
that
when
this
mother
's
very
hand
-
writing
had
come
to
him
with
words
holding
her
actual
feeling
,
his
affections
had
suddenly
shrunk
into
a
state
of
comparative
neutrality
toward
her
.
<EOS>
A
veiled
figure
with
enigmatic
speech
had
thrust
away
that
image
which
,
in
spite
of
uncertainty
,
his
clinging
thought
had
gradually
modeled
and
made
the
possessor
of
his
tenderness
and
duteous
longing
.
<EOS>
When
he
set
off
to
Genoa
,
the
interest
really
uppermost
in
his
mind
<EOS>
had
hardly
so
much
relation
to
his
mother
as
to
Mordecai
and
Mirah
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
,
Dan
!
"
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
had
said
,
when
they
shook
hands
.
<EOS>
"
Whatever
else
changes
for
you
,
it
ca
n't
change
my
being
the
oldest
friend
you
have
known
,
and
the
one
who
has
all
along
felt
the
most
for
you
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
have
loved
you
better
if
you
'd
been
my
own
-
<EOS>
only
I
should
have
been
better
pleased
with
thinking
of
you
always
as
the
future
master
of
the
Abbey
instead
of
my
fine
nephew
;
and
then
you
would
have
seen
it
necessary
for
you
to
take
a
political
line
.
<EOS>
However
 
things
must
be
as
they
may
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
defensive
movement
of
the
baronet
's
to
mingle
purposeless
remarks
with
the
expression
of
serious
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
When
Deronda
arrived
at
the
_
Italia
_
in
Genoa
,
no
Princess
Halm
-
Eberstein
was
there
;
but
on
the
second
day
there
was
a
letter
for
him
,
saying
that
her
arrival
might
happen
within
a
week
,
or
might
be
deferred
a
fortnight
and
more
;
she
was
under
circumstances
which
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
fix
her
journey
more
precisely
,
and
she
entreated
him
to
wait
as
patiently
as
he
could
.
  
<EOS>
With
this
indefinite
prospect
of
suspense
on
matters
of
supreme
moment
to
him
,
Deronda
set
about
the
difficult
task
of
seeking
amusement
on
philosophic
grounds
,
as
a
means
of
quieting
excited
feeling
and
giving
patience
a
lift
over
a
weary
road
.
<EOS>
His
former
visit
to
the
superb
city
had
been
only
cursory
,
and
left
him
much
to
learn
beyond
the
prescribed
round
of
sight
-
seeing
,
by
spending
the
cooler
hours
in
observant
wandering
about
the
streets
,
the
quay
,
and
the
environs
;
and
he
often
took
a
boat
that
he
might
enjoy
the
magnificent
view
of
the
city
and
harbor
from
the
sea
.
<EOS>
All
sights
,
all
subjects
,
even
the
expected
meeting
with
his
mother
,
found
a
central
union
in
Mordecai
and
Mirah
,
and
the
ideas
immediately
associated
with
them
;
and
among
the
thoughts
that
most
filled
his
mind
while
his
boat
was
pushing
about
within
view
of
the
grand
harbor
was
that
of
the
multitudinous
Spanish
Jews
centuries
ago
driven
destitute
from
their
Spanish
homes
,
suffered
to
land
from
the
crowded
ships
only
for
a
brief
rest
on
this
grand
quay
of
Genoa
,
overspreading
it
with
a
pall
of
famine
and
plague
 
dying
mothers
and
dying
children
at
their
breasts
 
fathers
and
sons
a
-
gaze
at
each
other
's
haggardness
,
like
groups
from
a
hundred
Hunger
-
towers
<EOS>
turned
out
beneath
the
midday
sun
.
<EOS>
Inevitably
dreamy
constructions
of
a
possible
ancestry
for
himself
would
weave
themselves
with
historic
memories
which
had
begun
to
have
a
new
interest
for
him
on
his
discovery
of
Mirah
,
and
now
,
under
the
influence
of
Mordecai
,
had
become
irresistibly
dominant
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
sealed
his
mind
against
such
constructions
if
it
had
been
possible
,
and
he
had
never
yet
fully
admitted
to
himself
that
he
wished
the
facts
to
verify
Mordecai
's
conviction
:
he
inwardly
repeated
that
he
had
no
choice
in
the
matter
,
and
that
wishing
was
folly
 
nay
,
on
the
question
of
parentage
,
wishing
seemed
part
of
that
meanness
which
disowns
kinship
:
it
was
a
disowning
by
anticipation
.
<EOS>
What
he
had
to
do
was
simply
to
accept
the
fact
;
and
he
had
really
no
strong
presumption
to
go
upon
,
now
that
he
was
assured
of
his
mistake
about
Sir
Hugo
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
a
resolved
concealment
which
made
all
inference
untrustworthy
,
and
the
very
name
he
bore
might
be
a
false
one
.
<EOS>
If
Mordecai
was
wrong
 
if
he
,
the
so
-
called
Daniel
Deronda
,
were
held
by
ties
entirely
aloof
from
any
such
course
as
his
friend
's
pathetic
hope
had
marked
out
?
 
<EOS>
he
would
not
say
"
I
wish
"
;
but
he
could
not
help
feeling
on
which
side
the
sacrifice
lay
.
  
<EOS>
Across
these
two
importunate
thoughts
,
which
he
resisted
as
much
as
one
can
resist
anything
in
that
unstrung
condition
which
belongs
to
suspense
,
there
came
continually
an
anxiety
which
he
made
no
effort
to
banish
 
dwelling
on
it
rather
with
a
mournfulness
,
which
often
seems
to
us
the
best
atonement
we
can
make
to
one
whose
need
we
have
been
unable
to
meet
.
<EOS>
The
anxiety
was
for
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
In
the
wonderful
mixtures
of
our
nature
there
is
a
feeling
distinct
from
that
exclusive
passionate
love
of
which
<EOS>
some
men
and
women
(
by
no
means
all
)
are
capable
,
which
yet
is
not
the
same
with
friendship
,
nor
with
a
merely
benevolent
regard
,
whether
admiring
or
compassionate
:
a
man
,
say
 
for
it
is
a
man
who
is
here
concerned
 
hardly
represents
to
himself
this
shade
of
feeling
toward
a
woman
more
nearly
than
in
words
,
"
I
should
have
loved
her
,
if
   
"
:
the
"
if
"
covering
some
prior
growth
in
the
inclinations
,
or
else
some
circumstances
which
have
made
an
inward
prohibitory
law
as
a
stay
against
the
emotions
ready
to
quiver
out
of
balance
.
<EOS>
The
"
if
"
in
Deronda
's
case
carried
reasons
of
both
kinds
;
yet
he
had
never
throughout
his
relations
with
Gwendolen
been
free
from
the
nervous
consciousness
that
there
was
something
to
guard
against
not
only
on
her
account
but
on
his
own
 
some
precipitancy
in
the
manifestations
of
impulsive
feeling
 
some
ruinous
inroad
of
what
is
but
momentary
on
the
permanent
chosen
treasure
of
the
heart
 
<EOS>
some
spoiling
of
her
trust
,
which
wrought
upon
him
now
as
if
it
had
been
the
retreating
cry
of
a
creature
snatched
and
carried
out
of
his
reach
by
swift
horsemen
or
swifter
waves
,
while
his
own
strength
was
only
a
stronger
sense
of
weakness
.
<EOS>
How
could
his
feelings
for
Gwendolen
ever
be
exactly
like
his
feelings
for
other
women
,
even
when
there
was
one
by
whose
side
he
desired
to
stand
apart
from
them
?
<EOS>
Strangely
the
figure
entered
into
the
pictures
of
his
present
and
future
;
strangely
(
and
now
it
seemed
sadly
)
<EOS>
their
two
lots
had
come
in
contact
,
hers
narrowly
personal
,
his
charged
with
far
-
reaching
sensibilities
,
perhaps
with
durable
purposes
,
which
were
hardly
more
present
to
her
than
the
reasons
why
men
migrate
are
present
to
the
birds
that
come
as
usual
for
the
crumbs
and
find
them
no
more
.
<EOS>
Not
that
Deronda
was
too
ready
to
imagine
himself
of
supreme
importance
to
a
woman
;
but
her
words
of
insistance
that
he
must
"
remain
near
her
 
must
not
forsake
her
<EOS>
"
 
continually
recurred
to
him
with
the
clearness
and
importunity
of
imagined
sounds
,
such
as
Dante
has
said
pierce
us
like
arrows
whose
points
carry
the
sharpness
of
pity
      
"

"
  
Day
after
day
passed
,
and
the
very
air
of
Italy
seemed
to
carry
the
consciousness
that
war
had
been
declared
against
Austria
,
and
every
day
was
a
hurrying
march
of
crowded
Time
toward
the
world
-
changing
battle
of
Sadowa
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
in
Genoa
,
the
noons
were
getting
hotter
,
the
converging
outer
roads
getting
deeper
with
white
dust
,
the
oleanders
in
the
tubs
along
the
wayside
gardens
looking
more
and
more
like
fatigued
holiday
-
makers
,
and
the
sweet
evening
changing
her
office
 
<EOS>
scattering
abroad
those
whom
the
midday
had
sent
under
shelter
,
and
sowing
all
paths
with
happy
social
sounds
,
little
tinklings
of
mule
-
bells
and
whirrings
of
thrumbed
strings
,
light
footsteps
and
voices
,
if
not
leisurely
,
then
with
the
hurry
of
pleasure
in
them
;
while
the
encircling
heights
,
crowned
with
forts
,
skirted
with
fine
dwellings
and
gardens
,
seemed
also
to
come
forth
and
gaze
in
fullness
of
beauty
after
their
long
siesta
,
till
all
strong
color
melted
in
the
stream
of
moonlight
which
made
the
Streets
a
new
spectacle
with
shadows
,
both
still
and
moving
,
on
cathedral
steps
and
against
the
façades
of
massive
palaces
;
and
then
slowly
with
the
descending
moon
all
sank
in
deep
night
and
silence
,
and
nothing
shone
but
the
port
lights
of
the
great
Lanterna
in
the
blackness
below
,
and
the
glimmering
stars
in
the
blackness
above
.
<EOS>
Deronda
,
in
his
suspense
,
watched
this
revolving
of
the
days
as
he
might
have
watched
a
wonderful
clock
where
the
striking
of
the
hours
was
made
solemn
with
antique
figures
advancing
and
retreating
in
monitory
procession
,
while
he
still
kept
his
ear
open
for
another
kind
of
signal
which
would
have
its
solemnity
too
:
He
was
beginning
to
sicken
of
occupation
,
and
found
himself
contemplating
all
activity
with
the
aloofness
of
a
prisoner
awaiting
ransom
.
<EOS>
In
his
letters
to
Mordecai
and
Hans
,
he
had
avoided
writing
about
himself
,
but
he
was
really
getting
into
that
state
of
mind
to
which
all
subjects
become
personal
;
and
the
few
books
he
had
brought
to
make
him
a
refuge
in
study
were
becoming
unreadable
,
because
the
point
of
view
that
life
would
make
for
him
was
in
that
agitating
moment
of
uncertainty
which
is
close
upon
decision
.
  
<EOS>
Many
nights
were
watched
through
by
him
in
gazing
from
the
open
window
of
his
room
on
the
double
,
faintly
pierced
darkness
of
the
sea
and
the
heavens
;
often
in
struggling
under
the
oppressive
skepticism
which
represented
his
particular
lot
,
with
all
the
importance
he
was
allowing
Mordecai
to
give
it
,
as
of
no
more
lasting
effect
than
a
dream
 
a
set
of
changes
which
made
passion
to
him
,
but
beyond
his
consciousness
were
no
more
than
an
imperceptible
difference
of
mass
and
shadow
;
sometimes
with
a
reaction
of
emotive
force
which
gave
even
to
sustained
disappointment
,
even
to
the
fulfilled
demand
of
sacrifice
,
the
nature
of
a
satisfied
energy
,
and
spread
over
his
young
future
,
whatever
it
might
be
,
the
attraction
of
devoted
service
;
sometimes
with
a
sweet
irresistible
hopefulness
that
the
very
best
of
human
possibilities
might
befall
him
 
the
blending
of
a
complete
personal
love
in
one
current
with
a
larger
duty
;
and
sometimes
again
in
a
mood
of
rebellion
(
what
human
creature
escapes
it
?
)
<EOS>
against
things
in
general
because
they
are
thus
and
not
otherwise
,
a
mood
in
which
Gwendolen
and
her
equivocal
fate
moved
as
busy
images
of
what
was
amiss
in
the
world
along
with
the
concealments
which
he
had
felt
as
a
hardship
in
his
own
life
,
and
which
were
acting
in
him
now
under
the
form
of
an
afflicting
doubtfulness
about
the
mother
who
had
announced
herself
coldly
and
still
kept
away
.
  
<EOS>
But
at
last
she
was
come
.
<EOS>
One
morning
in
his
third
week
of
waiting
there
was
a
new
kind
of
knock
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
A
servant
in
Chasseurs
livery
entered
and
delivered
in
French
the
verbal
message
that
,
the
Princess
Halm
-
Eberstein
had
arrived
,
that
she
was
going
to
rest
during
the
day
,
but
would
be
obliged
if
Monsieur
would
dine
early
,
so
as
to
be
at
liberty
at
seven
,
when
she
would
be
able
to
receive
him
.
        
<EOS>
She
held
the
spindle
as
she
sat
,
    
Errina
with
the
thick
-
coiled
mat
    
Of
raven
hair
and
deepest
agate
eyes
,
    
Gazing
with
a
sad
surprise
    
<EOS>
At
surging
visions
of
her
destiny
      
To
spin
the
byssus
drearily
    
In
insect
-
labor
,
while
the
throng
  
Of
gods
and
men
wrought
deeds
that
poets
wrought
in
song
.
   
<EOS>
When
Deronda
presented
himself
at
the
door
of
his
mother
's
apartment
in
the
_
Italia
_
he
felt
some
revival
of
his
boyhood
with
its
premature
agitations
.
<EOS>
The
two
servants
in
the
antechamber
looked
at
him
markedly
,
a
little
surprised
that
the
doctor
their
lady
had
come
to
consult
<EOS>
was
this
striking
young
gentleman
whose
appearance
gave
even
the
severe
lines
of
an
evening
dress
the
credit
of
adornment
.
<EOS>
But
Deronda
could
notice
nothing
until
,
the
second
door
being
opened
,
he
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
a
figure
which
at
the
other
end
of
the
large
room
stood
awaiting
his
approach
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
covered
,
except
as
to
her
face
and
part
of
her
arms
,
with
black
lace
hanging
loosely
from
the
summit
of
her
whitening
hair
to
the
long
train
stretching
from
her
tall
figure
.
<EOS>
Her
arms
,
naked
to
the
elbow
,
except
for
some
rich
bracelets
,
were
folded
before
her
,
and
the
fine
poise
of
her
head
made
it
look
handsomer
than
it
really
was
.
<EOS>
But
Deronda
felt
no
interval
of
observation
before
he
was
close
in
front
of
her
,
holding
the
hand
she
had
put
out
and
then
raising
it
to
his
lips
.
<EOS>
She
still
kept
her
hand
in
his
and
looked
at
him
examiningly
;
while
his
chief
consciousness
was
that
her
eyes
were
piercing
and
her
face
<EOS>
so
mobile
that
the
next
moment
she
might
look
like
a
different
person
.
<EOS>
For
even
while
she
was
examining
him
there
was
a
play
of
the
brow
and
nostril
which
made
a
tacit
language
.
<EOS>
Deronda
dared
no
movement
,
not
able
to
conceive
what
sort
of
manifestation
her
feeling
demanded
;
but
he
felt
himself
changing
color
like
a
girl
,
and
yet
wondering
at
his
own
lack
of
emotion
;
he
had
lived
through
so
many
ideal
meetings
with
his
mother
,
and
they
had
seemed
more
real
than
this
!
<EOS>
He
could
not
even
conjecture
in
what
language
she
would
speak
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
imagined
it
would
not
be
English
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
she
let
fall
his
hand
,
and
placed
both
hers
on
his
shoulders
,
while
her
face
gave
out
a
flash
of
admiration
in
which
every
worn
line
disappeared
and
seemed
to
leave
a
restored
youth
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
beautiful
creature
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
in
a
low
melodious
voice
,
with
syllables
which
had
what
might
be
called
a
foreign
but
agreeable
outline
.
<EOS>
"
I
knew
you
would
be
.
"
<EOS>
Then
she
kissed
him
on
each
cheek
,
and
he
returned
the
kisses
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
something
like
a
greeting
between
royalties
.
  
<EOS>
She
paused
a
moment
while
the
lines
were
coming
back
into
her
face
,
and
then
said
in
a
colder
tone
,
"
I
am
your
mother
.
<EOS>
But
you
can
have
no
love
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
thought
of
you
more
than
of
any
other
being
in
the
world
,
"
said
Deronda
,
his
voice
trembling
nervously
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
like
what
you
thought
I
was
,
"
said
the
mother
decisively
,
withdrawing
her
hands
from
his
shoulders
,
and
folding
her
arms
as
before
,
looking
at
him
as
if
she
invited
him
to
observe
her
.
<EOS>
He
had
often
pictured
her
face
in
his
imagination
as
one
which
had
a
likeness
to
his
own
:
he
saw
some
of
the
likeness
now
,
but
amidst
more
striking
differences
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
remarkable
looking
being
.
<EOS>
What
was
it
that
gave
her
son
a
painful
sense
of
aloofness
?
 
<EOS>
Her
worn
beauty
had
a
strangeness
in
it
as
if
she
were
not
quite
a
human
mother
,
but
a
Melusina
,
who
had
ties
with
some
world
which
is
independent
of
ours
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
used
to
think
that
you
might
be
suffering
,
"
said
Deronda
,
anxious
above
all
not
to
wound
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
used
to
wish
that
I
could
be
a
comfort
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
_
am
_
suffering
.
<EOS>
But
with
a
suffering
that
you
ca
n't
comfort
,
"
said
the
Princess
,
in
a
harder
voice
than
before
,
moving
to
a
sofa
where
cushions
had
been
carefully
arranged
for
her
.
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
.
"
<EOS>
She
pointed
to
a
seat
near
her
;
and
then
discerning
some
distress
in
Deronda
's
face
,
she
added
,
more
gently
,
"
I
am
not
suffering
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
I
am
at
ease
now
.
<EOS>
I
am
able
to
talk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
seated
himself
and
waited
for
her
to
speak
again
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
if
he
were
in
the
presence
of
a
mysterious
Fate
rather
than
of
the
longed
-
for
mother
.
<EOS>
He
was
beginning
to
watch
her
with
wonder
,
from
the
spiritual
distance
to
which
she
had
thrown
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
she
began
:
"
I
did
not
send
for
you
to
comfort
me
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
know
beforehand
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
now
 
what
you
will
feel
toward
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
foolish
notion
that
you
can
love
me
merely
because
I
am
your
mother
,
when
you
have
never
seen
or
heard
of
me
in
all
your
life
.
<EOS>
But
I
thought
I
chose
something
better
for
you
than
being
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
think
I
deprived
you
of
anything
worth
having
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
wish
me
to
believe
that
your
affection
would
not
have
been
worth
having
,
"
said
Deronda
,
finding
that
she
paused
as
if
she
expected
him
to
make
some
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mean
to
speak
ill
of
myself
,
"
said
the
princess
,
with
proud
impetuosity
,
"
<EOS>
But
I
had
not
much
affection
to
give
you
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
want
affection
.
<EOS>
I
had
been
stifled
with
it
.
<EOS>
I
wanted
to
live
out
the
life
that
was
in
me
,
and
not
to
be
hampered
with
other
lives
.
<EOS>
You
wonder
what
I
was
.
<EOS>
I
was
no
princess
then
.
<EOS>
"
She
rose
with
a
sudden
movement
,
and
stood
as
she
had
done
before
.
<EOS>
Deronda
immediately
rose
too
;
he
felt
breathless
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
princess
in
this
tame
life
that
I
live
in
now
.
<EOS>
I
was
a
great
singer
,
and
I
acted
as
well
as
I
sang
.
<EOS>
All
the
rest
were
poor
beside
me
.
<EOS>
Men
followed
me
from
one
country
to
another
.
<EOS>
I
was
living
a
myriad
lives
in
one
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
want
a
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
passionate
self
-
defence
in
her
tone
.
<EOS>
She
had
cast
all
precedent
out
of
her
mind
.
<EOS>
Precedent
had
no
excuse
for
her
<EOS>
and
she
could
only
seek
a
justification
in
the
intensest
words
she
could
find
for
her
experience
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
fling
out
the
last
words
against
some
possible
reproach
in
the
mind
of
her
son
,
who
had
to
stand
and
hear
them
 
clutching
his
coat
-
collar
as
if
he
were
keeping
himself
above
water
by
it
,
and
feeling
his
blood
in
the
sort
of
commotion
that
might
have
been
excited
if
he
had
seen
her
going
through
some
strange
rite
of
a
religion
which
gave
a
sacredness
to
crime
.
<EOS>
What
else
had
she
to
tell
him
?
<EOS>
She
went
on
with
the
same
intensity
and
a
sort
of
pale
illumination
in
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
want
to
marry
.
<EOS>
I
was
forced
into
marrying
your
father
 
forced
,
I
mean
,
by
my
father
's
wishes
and
commands
;
and
besides
,
it
was
my
best
way
of
getting
some
freedom
.
<EOS>
I
could
rule
my
husband
,
but
not
my
father
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
right
to
be
free
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
right
to
seek
my
freedom
from
a
bondage
that
I
hated
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
seated
herself
again
,
while
there
was
that
subtle
movement
in
her
eyes
and
closed
lips
which
is
like
the
suppressed
continuation
of
speech
.
<EOS>
Deronda
continued
standing
,
and
after
a
moment
or
two
she
looked
up
at
him
with
a
less
defiant
pleading
as
she
said
    
"
<EOS>
And
the
bondage
I
hated
for
myself
I
wanted
to
keep
you
from
.
<EOS>
What
better
could
the
most
loving
mother
have
done
?
<EOS>
I
relieved
you
from
the
bondage
of
having
been
born
a
Jew
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
_
am
_
a
Jew
?
"
<EOS>
Deronda
burst
out
with
a
deep
-
voiced
energy
that
made
his
mother
shrink
a
little
backward
against
her
cushions
.
<EOS>
"
My
father
was
a
Jew
,
and
you
are
a
Jewess
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
your
father
was
my
cousin
,
"
said
the
mother
,
watching
him
with
a
change
in
her
look
,
as
if
she
saw
something
that
she
might
have
to
be
afraid
of
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
of
it
,
"
said
Deronda
,
impetuously
,
in
the
veiled
voice
of
passion
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
imagined
beforehand
how
he
would
have
come
to
say
that
which
he
had
never
hitherto
admitted
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
dreamed
that
it
would
be
in
impulsive
opposition
to
his
mother
.
<EOS>
He
was
shaken
by
a
mixed
anger
which
no
reflection
could
come
soon
enough
to
check
,
against
this
mother
who
it
seemed
had
borne
him
unwillingly
,
had
willingly
made
herself
a
stranger
to
him
,
and
 
perhaps
 
was
now
making
herself
known
unwillingly
.
<EOS>
This
last
suspicion
seemed
to
flash
some
explanation
over
her
speech
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
mother
was
equally
shaken
by
an
anger
differently
mixed
,
and
her
frame
was
less
equal
to
any
repression
.
<EOS>
The
shaking
with
her
was
visibly
physical
,
and
her
eyes
looked
the
larger
for
her
pallid
excitement
as
she
said
violently
    
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
say
you
are
glad
?
<EOS>
You
are
an
English
gentleman
.
<EOS>
I
secured
you
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
did
not
know
what
you
secured
me
.
<EOS>
How
could
you
choose
my
birthright
for
me
?
"
said
Deronda
,
throwing
himself
sideways
into
his
chair
again
,
almost
unconsciously
,
and
leaning
his
arm
over
the
back
,
while
he
looked
away
from
his
mother
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
fired
with
an
intolerance
that
seemed
foreign
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
now
trying
hard
to
master
himself
and
keep
silence
.
<EOS>
A
horror
had
swept
in
upon
his
anger
lest
he
should
say
something
too
hard
in
this
moment
which
made
an
epoch
never
to
be
recalled
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
pause
before
his
mother
spoke
again
,
and
when
she
spoke
her
voice
had
become
more
firmly
resistant
in
its
finely
varied
tones
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
chose
for
you
what
I
would
have
chosen
for
myself
.
<EOS>
How
could
I
know
that
you
would
have
the
spirit
of
my
father
in
you
?
<EOS>
How
could
I
know
that
you
would
love
what
I
hated
?
 
<EOS>
if
you
really
love
to
be
a
Jew
.
<EOS>
"
The
last
words
had
such
bitterness
in
them
that
any
one
overhearing
might
have
supposed
some
hatred
had
arisen
between
the
mother
and
son
.
  
<EOS>
But
Deronda
had
recovered
his
fuller
self
.
<EOS>
He
was
recalling
his
sensibilities
to
what
life
had
been
and
actually
was
for
her
whose
best
years
were
gone
,
and
who
with
the
signs
of
suffering
in
her
frame
was
now
exerting
herself
to
tell
him
of
a
past
which
was
not
his
alone
but
also
hers
.
<EOS>
His
habitual
shame
at
the
acceptance
of
events
as
if
they
were
his
only
,
helped
him
even
here
.
<EOS>
As
he
looked
at
his
mother
silently
after
her
last
words
,
his
face
regained
some
of
its
penetrative
calm
;
yet
it
seemed
to
have
a
strangely
agitating
influence
over
her
:
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
with
a
sort
of
fascination
,
but
not
with
any
repose
of
maternal
delight
.
  
<EOS>
"
Forgive
me
,
if
I
speak
hastily
,
"
he
said
,
with
diffident
gravity
.
<EOS>
"
Why
have
you
resolved
now
on
disclosing
to
me
what
you
took
care
to
have
me
brought
up
in
ignorance
of
?
<EOS>
Why
 
since
you
seem
angry
that
I
should
be
glad
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
 
the
reasons
of
our
actions
!
"
said
the
Princess
,
with
a
ring
of
something
like
sarcastic
scorn
.
<EOS>
"
When
you
are
as
old
as
I
am
,
it
will
not
seem
so
simple
a
question
 
<EOS>
"
Why
did
you
do
this
?
<EOS>
"
People
talk
of
their
motives
in
a
cut
and
dried
way
.
<EOS>
Every
woman
is
supposed
to
have
the
same
set
of
motives
,
or
else
to
be
a
monster
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
a
monster
,
but
I
have
not
felt
exactly
what
other
women
feel
 
or
say
they
feel
,
for
fear
of
being
thought
unlike
others
.
<EOS>
When
you
reproach
me
in
your
heart
for
sending
you
away
from
me
,
you
mean
that
I
ought
to
say
I
felt
about
you
as
other
women
say
they
feel
about
their
children
.
<EOS>
I
did
_
<EOS>
not
_
feel
that
.
<EOS>
I
was
glad
to
be
freed
from
you
.
<EOS>
But
I
did
well
for
you
,
and
I
gave
you
your
father
's
fortune
.
<EOS>
Do
I
seem
now
to
be
revoking
everything
?
 
<EOS>
Well
,
there
are
reasons
.
<EOS>
I
feel
many
things
that
I
can
not
understand
.
<EOS>
A
fatal
illness
has
been
growing
in
me
for
a
year
.
<EOS>
I
shall
very
likely
not
live
another
year
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
deny
anything
I
have
done
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
pretend
to
love
where
I
have
no
love
.
<EOS>
But
shadows
are
rising
round
me
.
<EOS>
Sickness
makes
them
.
<EOS>
If
I
have
wronged
the
dead
 
<EOS>
I
have
but
<EOS>
little
time
to
do
what
I
left
undone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
varied
transitions
of
tone
with
which
this
speech
was
delivered
were
as
perfect
as
the
most
accomplished
actress
could
have
made
them
.
<EOS>
The
speech
was
in
fact
a
piece
of
what
may
be
called
sincere
acting
;
this
woman
's
nature
was
one
in
which
all
feeling
 
and
all
the
more
when
it
was
tragic
as
well
as
real
 
immediately
became
matter
of
conscious
representation
:
experience
immediately
passed
into
drama
,
and
she
acted
her
own
emotions
.
<EOS>
In
a
minor
degree
this
is
nothing
uncommon
,
but
in
the
Princess
the
acting
had
a
rare
perfection
of
physiognomy
,
voice
,
and
gesture
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
be
true
to
say
that
she
felt
less
because
of
this
double
consciousness
:
she
felt
 
that
is
,
her
mind
went
through
 
all
the
more
,
but
with
a
difference
;
each
nucleus
of
pain
or
pleasure
had
a
deep
atmosphere
of
the
excitement
or
spiritual
intoxication
<EOS>
which
at
once
exalts
and
deadens
.
<EOS>
But
Deronda
made
no
reflection
of
this
kind
.
<EOS>
All
his
thoughts
hung
on
the
purport
of
what
his
mother
was
saying
;
her
tones
and
her
wonderful
face
entered
into
his
agitation
without
being
noted
.
<EOS>
What
he
longed
for
with
an
awed
desire
was
to
know
as
much
as
she
would
tell
him
of
the
strange
mental
conflict
under
which
it
seemed
he
had
been
brought
into
the
world
;
what
his
compassionate
nature
made
the
controlling
idea
within
him
were
the
suffering
and
the
confession
that
breathed
through
her
later
words
,
and
these
forbade
any
further
question
,
when
she
paused
and
remained
silent
,
with
her
brow
knit
,
her
head
turned
a
little
away
from
him
,
and
her
large
eyes
fixed
as
if
on
something
incorporeal
.
<EOS>
He
must
wait
for
her
to
speak
again
.
<EOS>
She
did
so
with
strange
abruptness
,
turning
her
eyes
upon
him
suddenly
,
and
saying
more
quickly
    
<EOS>
"
Sir
Hugo
has
written
much
about
you
.
<EOS>
He
tells
me
you
have
a
wonderful
mind
 
<EOS>
you
comprehend
everything
 
<EOS>
you
are
wiser
than
he
is
with
all
his
sixty
years
.
<EOS>
You
say
you
are
glad
to
know
that
you
were
born
a
Jew
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
going
to
tell
you
that
I
have
changed
my
mind
about
that
.
<EOS>
Your
feelings
are
against
mine
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
thank
me
for
what
I
did
.
<EOS>
Shall
you
comprehend
your
mother
,
or
only
blame
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
not
a
fibre
within
me
but
makes
me
wish
to
comprehend
her
,
"
said
Deronda
,
meeting
her
sharp
gaze
solemnly
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
bitter
reversal
of
my
longing
to
think
of
blaming
her
.
<EOS>
What
I
have
been
most
trying
to
do
for
fifteen
years
is
to
have
some
understanding
of
those
who
differ
from
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
have
become
unlike
your
grandfather
in
that
.
"
said
the
mother
,
"
though
you
are
a
young
copy
of
him
in
your
face
.
<EOS>
He
never
comprehended
me
,
or
if
he
did
,
he
only
thought
of
fettering
me
into
obedience
.
<EOS>
I
was
to
be
what
he
called
"
the
Jewish
woman
"
under
pain
of
his
curse
.
<EOS>
I
was
to
feel
everything
I
did
not
feel
,
and
believe
everything
I
did
not
believe
.
<EOS>
I
was
to
feel
awe
for
the
bit
of
parchment
in
the
_
mezuza
_
over
the
door
;
to
dread
lest
a
bit
of
butter
should
touch
a
bit
of
meat
;
to
think
it
beautiful
that
men
should
bind
the
_
tephillin
<EOS>
_
on
them
,
and
women
not
,
 
to
adore
the
wisdom
of
such
laws
,
however
silly
they
might
seem
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
was
to
love
the
long
prayers
in
the
ugly
synagogue
,
and
the
howling
,
and
the
gabbling
,
and
the
dreadful
fasts
,
and
the
tiresome
feasts
,
and
my
father
's
endless
discoursing
about
our
people
,
which
was
a
thunder
without
meaning
in
my
ears
.
<EOS>
I
was
to
care
forever
about
what
Israel
had
been
;
and
I
did
not
care
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
cared
for
the
wide
world
,
and
all
that
I
could
represent
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
hated
living
under
the
shadow
of
my
father
's
strictness
.
<EOS>
Teaching
,
teaching
for
everlasting
 
<EOS>
"
this
you
must
be
,
"
'
that
you
must
not
be
'
 
pressed
on
me
like
a
frame
that
got
tighter
and
tighter
as
I
grew
.
<EOS>
I
wanted
to
live
a
large
life
,
with
freedom
to
do
what
every
one
else
did
,
and
be
carried
along
in
a
great
current
,
not
obliged
to
care
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
"
 
<EOS>
here
her
tone
changed
to
one
of
a
more
bitter
incisiveness
 
<EOS>
"
you
are
glad
to
have
been
born
a
Jew
.
<EOS>
You
say
so
.
<EOS>
That
is
because
you
have
not
been
brought
up
as
a
Jew
.
<EOS>
That
separateness
seems
sweet
to
you
because
I
saved
you
from
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
you
resolved
on
that
,
you
meant
that
I
should
never
know
my
origin
?
"
said
Deronda
,
impulsively
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
at
least
changed
in
your
feeling
on
that
point
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
that
was
what
I
meant
.
<EOS>
That
is
what
I
persevered
in
.
<EOS>
And
it
is
not
true
to
say
that
I
have
changed
.
<EOS>
Things
have
changed
in
spite
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
still
the
same
Leonora
"
 
<EOS>
she
pointed
with
her
forefinger
to
her
breast
 
"
<EOS>
here
within
me
is
the
same
desire
,
the
same
will
,
the
same
choice
,
_
but
_
"
 
she
spread
out
her
hands
,
palm
upward
,
on
each
side
of
her
,
as
she
paused
with
a
bitter
compression
of
her
lip
,
then
let
her
voice
fall
into
muffled
,
rapid
utterance
 
<EOS>
"
events
come
upon
us
like
evil
enchantments
:
and
<EOS>
thoughts
,
feelings
,
apparitions
in
the
darkness
are
events
 
are
they
not
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
consent
.
<EOS>
We
only
consent
to
what
we
love
.
<EOS>
I
obey
something
tyrannic
"
 
<EOS>
she
spread
out
her
hands
again
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
forced
to
be
withered
,
to
feel
pain
,
to
be
dying
slowly
.
<EOS>
Do
I
love
that
?
<EOS>
Well
,
I
have
been
forced
to
obey
my
dead
father
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
forced
to
tell
you
that
you
are
a
Jew
,
and
deliver
to
you
what
he
commanded
me
to
deliver
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beseech
you
to
tell
me
what
moved
you
 
when
you
were
young
,
I
mean
 
to
take
the
course
you
did
,
"
said
Deronda
,
trying
by
this
reference
to
the
past
to
escape
from
what
to
him
was
the
heart
-
rending
piteousness
of
this
mingled
suffering
and
defiance
.
<EOS>
"
I
gather
that
my
grandfather
opposed
your
bent
to
be
an
artist
.
<EOS>
Though
my
own
experience
has
been
quite
different
,
I
enter
into
the
painfulness
of
your
struggle
.
<EOS>
I
can
imagine
the
hardship
of
an
enforced
renunciation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
the
Princess
,
shaking
her
head
and
folding
her
arms
with
an
air
of
decision
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
a
woman
.
<EOS>
You
may
try
 
but
you
can
never
imagine
what
it
is
to
have
a
man
's
force
of
genius
in
you
,
and
yet
to
suffer
the
slavery
of
being
a
girl
.
<EOS>
To
have
a
pattern
cut
out
 
"
this
is
the
Jewish
woman
;
this
is
what
you
must
be
;
this
is
what
you
are
wanted
for
;
a
woman
's
heart
must
be
of
such
a
size
and
no
larger
,
else
it
must
be
pressed
small
,
like
Chinese
feet
;
her
happiness
is
to
be
made
as
cakes
are
,
by
a
fixed
receipt
.
<EOS>
"
That
was
what
my
father
wanted
.
<EOS>
He
wished
I
had
been
a
son
;
he
cared
for
me
as
a
make
-
shift
link
.
<EOS>
His
heart
was
set
on
his
Judaism
.
<EOS>
He
hated
that
Jewish
women
should
be
thought
of
by
the
Christian
world
as
a
sort
of
ware
to
make
public
singers
and
actresses
of
.
<EOS>
As
if
we
were
not
the
more
enviable
for
that
!
<EOS>
That
is
a
chance
of
escaping
from
bondage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
my
grandfather
a
learned
man
?
"
said
Deronda
,
eager
to
know
particulars
that
he
feared
his
mother
might
not
think
of
.
  
<EOS>
She
answered
impatiently
,
putting
up
her
hand
,
"
Oh
,
yes
,
 
and
a
clever
physician
 
and
good
:
I
do
n't
deny
that
he
was
good
.
<EOS>
A
man
to
be
admired
in
a
play
 
grand
,
with
an
iron
will
.
<EOS>
Like
the
old
Foscari
before
he
pardons
.
<EOS>
But
such
men
turn
their
wives
and
daughters
into
slaves
.
<EOS>
They
would
rule
the
world
if
they
could
;
but
not
ruling
the
world
,
they
throw
all
the
weight
of
their
will
on
the
necks
and
souls
of
women
.
<EOS>
But
nature
sometimes
thwarts
them
.
<EOS>
My
father
had
no
other
child
than
his
daughter
,
and
she
was
like
himself
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
had
folded
her
arms
again
,
and
looked
as
if
she
were
ready
to
face
some
impending
attempt
at
mastery
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
father
was
different
.
<EOS>
Unlike
me
 
all
lovingness
and
affection
.
<EOS>
I
knew
I
could
rule
him
;
and
I
made
him
secretly
promise
me
,
before
I
married
him
,
that
he
would
put
no
hindrance
in
the
way
of
my
being
an
artist
.
<EOS>
My
father
was
on
his
deathbed
when
we
were
married
:
from
the
first
he
had
fixed
his
mind
on
my
marrying
my
cousin
Ephraim
.
<EOS>
And
when
a
woman
's
will
is
as
strong
as
the
man
's
who
wants
to
govern
her
,
half
her
strength
must
be
concealment
.
<EOS>
I
meant
to
have
my
will
in
the
end
,
but
I
could
only
have
it
by
seeming
to
obey
.
<EOS>
I
had
an
awe
of
my
father
 
<EOS>
always
I
had
had
an
awe
of
him
:
it
was
impossible
to
help
it
.
<EOS>
I
hated
to
feel
awed
 
<EOS>
I
wished
I
could
have
defied
him
openly
;
but
I
never
could
.
<EOS>
It
was
what
I
could
not
imagine
:
I
could
not
act
it
to
myself
that
I
should
begin
to
defy
my
father
openly
and
succeed
.
<EOS>
And
I
never
would
risk
failure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
last
sentence
was
uttered
with
an
abrupt
emphasis
,
and
she
paused
after
it
as
if
the
words
had
raised
a
crowd
of
remembrances
which
obstructed
speech
.
<EOS>
Her
son
was
listening
to
her
with
feelings
more
and
more
highly
mixed
;
the
first
sense
of
being
repelled
by
the
frank
coldness
which
had
replaced
all
his
preconceptions
of
a
mother
's
tender
joy
in
the
sight
of
him
;
the
first
impulses
of
indignation
at
what
shocked
his
most
cherished
emotions
and
principles
 
all
these
busy
elements
of
collision
between
them
were
subsiding
for
a
time
,
and
making
more
and
more
room
for
that
effort
at
just
allowance
and
that
admiration
of
a
forcible
nature
whose
errors
lay
along
high
pathways
,
which
he
would
have
felt
if
,
instead
of
being
his
mother
,
she
had
been
a
stranger
who
had
appealed
to
his
sympathy
.
<EOS>
Still
it
was
impossible
to
be
dispassionate
:
he
trembled
lest
the
next
thing
she
had
to
say
would
be
more
repugnant
to
him
than
what
had
gone
before
:
he
was
afraid
of
the
strange
coërcion
<EOS>
she
seemed
to
be
under
to
lay
her
mind
bare
:
he
almost
wished
he
could
say
,
"
Tell
me
only
what
is
necessary
,
"
and
then
again
he
felt
the
fascination
which
made
him
watch
her
and
listen
to
her
eagerly
.
<EOS>
He
tried
to
recall
her
to
particulars
by
asking
    
<EOS>
"
Where
was
my
grandfather
's
home
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Here
in
Genoa
,
where
I
was
married
;
and
his
family
had
lived
here
generations
ago
.
<EOS>
But
my
father
had
been
in
various
countries
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
surely
have
lived
in
England
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
mother
was
English
 
<EOS>
a
Jewess
of
Portuguese
descent
.
<EOS>
My
father
married
her
in
England
.
<EOS>
Certain
circumstances
of
that
marriage
made
all
the
difference
in
my
life
:
through
that
marriage
my
father
thwarted
his
own
plans
.
<EOS>
My
mother
's
sister
was
a
singer
,
and
afterward
she
married
the
English
partner
of
a
merchant
's
house
here
in
Genoa
,
and
they
came
and
lived
here
eleven
years
.
<EOS>
My
mother
died
when
I
was
eight
years
old
,
and
my
father
allowed
me
to
be
continually
with
my
Aunt
Leonora
and
be
taught
under
her
eyes
,
as
if
he
had
not
minded
the
danger
of
her
encouraging
my
wish
to
be
a
singer
,
as
she
had
been
.
<EOS>
But
this
was
it
 
<EOS>
I
saw
it
again
and
again
in
my
father
:
 
<EOS>
he
did
not
guard
against
consequences
,
because
he
felt
sure
he
could
hinder
them
if
he
liked
.
<EOS>
Before
my
aunt
left
Genoa
,
I
had
had
enough
teaching
to
bring
out
the
born
singer
and
actress
within
me
:
my
father
did
not
know
everything
that
was
done
;
but
he
knew
that
I
was
taught
music
and
singing
 
<EOS>
he
knew
my
inclination
.
<EOS>
That
was
nothing
to
him
:
he
meant
that
I
should
obey
his
will
.
<EOS>
And
he
was
resolved
that
I
should
marry
my
cousin
Ephraim
,
the
only
one
left
of
my
father
's
family
that
he
knew
.
<EOS>
I
wanted
not
to
marry
.
<EOS>
I
thought
of
all
plans
to
resist
it
,
but
at
last
I
found
that
I
could
rule
my
cousin
,
and
I
consented
.
<EOS>
My
father
died
three
weeks
after
we
were
married
,
and
then
I
had
my
way
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
uttered
these
words
almost
exultantly
;
but
after
a
little
pause
her
face
changed
,
and
she
said
in
a
biting
tone
,
"
It
has
not
lasted
,
though
.
<EOS>
My
father
is
getting
his
way
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
began
to
look
more
contemplatively
again
at
her
son
,
and
presently
said
    
"
You
are
like
him
 
<EOS>
but
milder
 
there
is
something
of
your
own
father
in
you
;
and
he
made
it
the
labor
of
his
life
to
devote
himself
to
me
:
wound
up
his
money
-
changing
and
banking
,
and
lived
to
wait
upon
me
 
<EOS>
he
went
against
his
conscience
for
me
.
<EOS>
As
I
loved
the
life
of
my
art
,
so
he
loved
me
.
<EOS>
Let
me
look
at
your
hand
again
:
the
hand
with
the
ring
on
.
<EOS>
It
was
your
father
's
ring
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
drew
his
chair
nearer
to
her
and
gave
her
his
hand
.
<EOS>
We
know
what
kind
of
a
hand
it
was
:
her
own
,
very
much
smaller
,
was
of
the
same
type
.
<EOS>
As
he
felt
the
smaller
hand
holding
his
,
as
he
saw
nearer
to
him
the
face
that
held
the
likeness
of
his
own
,
aged
not
by
time
but
by
intensity
,
the
strong
bent
of
his
nature
toward
a
reverential
tenderness
asserted
itself
above
every
other
impression
and
in
his
most
fervent
tone
<EOS>
he
said
    
"
Mother
!
<EOS>
take
us
all
into
your
heart
 
the
living
and
the
dead
.
<EOS>
Forgive
every
thing
that
hurts
you
in
the
past
.
<EOS>
Take
my
affection
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
at
him
admiringly
rather
than
lovingly
,
then
kissed
him
on
the
brow
,
and
saying
sadly
,
"
I
reject
nothing
,
but
I
have
nothing
to
give
,
"
she
released
his
hand
and
sank
back
on
her
cushions
.
<EOS>
Deronda
turned
pale
with
what
seems
always
more
of
a
sensation
than
an
emotion
 
<EOS>
the
pain
of
repulsed
tenderness
.
<EOS>
She
noticed
the
expression
of
pain
,
and
said
,
still
with
melodious
melancholy
in
her
tones
    
<EOS>
"
It
is
better
so
.
<EOS>
We
must
part
again
soon
<EOS>
and
you
owe
me
no
duties
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
wish
you
to
be
born
.
<EOS>
I
parted
with
you
willingly
.
<EOS>
When
your
father
died
I
resolved
that
I
would
have
no
more
ties
,
but
such
as
I
could
free
myself
from
.
<EOS>
I
was
the
<EOS>
Alcharisi
you
have
heard
of
:
the
name
had
magic
wherever
it
was
carried
.
<EOS>
Men
courted
me
.
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
Mallinger
was
one
who
wished
to
marry
me
.
<EOS>
He
was
madly
in
love
with
me
.
<EOS>
One
day
I
asked
him
,
"
Is
there
a
man
capable
of
doing
something
for
love
of
me
,
and
expecting
nothing
in
return
?
"
<EOS>
He
said
:
"
What
is
it
you
want
done
?
"
<EOS>
I
said
,
"
Take
my
boy
and
bring
him
up
as
an
Englishman
,
and
never
let
him
know
anything
about
his
parents
.
<EOS>
"
You
were
little
more
than
two
years
old
,
and
were
sitting
on
his
foot
.
<EOS>
He
declared
that
he
would
pay
money
to
have
such
a
boy
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
meditated
much
on
the
plan
beforehand
,
but
as
soon
as
I
had
spoken
about
it
,
it
took
possession
of
me
as
something
I
could
not
rest
without
doing
.
<EOS>
At
first
he
thought
I
was
not
serious
,
but
I
convinced
him
,
and
he
was
never
surprised
at
anything
.
<EOS>
He
agreed
that
it
would
be
for
your
good
,
and
the
finest
thing
for
you
.
<EOS>
A
great
singer
and
actress
is
a
queen
,
but
she
gives
no
royalty
to
her
son
.
<EOS>
All
that
happened
at
Naples
.
<EOS>
And
afterward
I
made
Sir
Hugo
the
trustee
of
your
fortune
.
<EOS>
That
is
what
I
did
;
and
I
had
a
joy
in
doing
it
.
<EOS>
My
father
had
tyrannized
over
me
 
he
cared
more
about
a
grandson
to
come
than
he
did
about
me
:
I
counted
as
nothing
.
<EOS>
You
were
to
be
such
a
Jew
as
he
;
you
were
to
be
what
he
wanted
.
<EOS>
But
you
were
my
son
,
and
it
was
my
turn
to
say
what
you
should
be
.
<EOS>
I
said
you
should
not
know
you
were
a
Jew
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
for
months
events
have
been
preparing
me
to
be
glad
that
I
am
a
Jew
,
"
said
Deronda
,
his
opposition
roused
again
.
<EOS>
The
point
touched
the
quick
of
his
experience
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
always
have
been
better
that
I
should
have
known
the
truth
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
been
rebelling
against
the
secrecy
that
looked
like
shame
.
<EOS>
It
is
no
shame
to
have
Jewish
parents
 
<EOS>
the
shame
is
to
disown
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
say
it
was
a
shame
to
me
,
then
,
that
I
used
that
secrecy
,
"
said
his
mother
,
with
a
flash
of
new
anger
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
shame
attaching
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
reason
to
be
ashamed
.
<EOS>
I
rid
myself
of
the
Jewish
tatters
and
gibberish
that
make
people
nudge
each
other
at
sight
of
us
,
as
if
we
were
tattooed
under
our
clothes
,
though
our
faces
are
as
whole
as
theirs
.
<EOS>
I
delivered
you
from
the
pelting
contempt
that
pursues
Jewish
separateness
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
ashamed
that
I
did
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
better
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
why
have
you
now
undone
the
secrecy
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
not
undone
it
 
<EOS>
the
effects
will
never
be
undone
.
<EOS>
But
why
have
you
now
sent
for
me
to
tell
me
that
I
am
a
Jew
?
"
said
Deronda
,
with
an
intensity
of
opposition
in
feeling
that
was
almost
bitter
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
if
her
words
had
called
out
a
latent
obstinacy
of
race
in
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
 
<EOS>
ah
,
why
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
Princess
,
rising
quickly
and
walking
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
,
where
she
turned
round
and
slowly
approached
him
,
as
he
,
too
,
stood
up
.
<EOS>
Then
she
began
to
speak
again
in
a
more
veiled
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
explain
;
I
can
only
say
what
is
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
love
my
father
's
religion
now
any
more
than
I
did
then
.
<EOS>
Before
I
married
the
second
time
I
was
baptized
;
I
made
myself
like
the
people
I
lived
among
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
right
to
do
it
;
I
was
not
like
a
brute
,
obliged
to
go
with
my
own
herd
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
repented
;
I
will
not
say
that
I
have
repented
.
<EOS>
But
yet
"
 
here
she
had
come
near
to
her
son
,
and
paused
;
then
again
retreated
a
little
and
stood
still
,
as
if
resolute
not
to
give
way
utterly
to
an
imperious
influence
;
but
,
as
she
went
on
speaking
,
she
became
more
and
more
unconscious
of
anything
<EOS>
but
the
awe
that
subdued
her
voice
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
illness
,
I
do
n't
doubt
that
it
has
been
gathering
illness
 
<EOS>
my
mind
has
gone
back
:
more
than
a
year
ago
it
began
.
<EOS>
You
see
my
gray
hair
,
my
worn
look
:
it
has
all
come
fast
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
I
am
in
an
agony
of
pain
 
<EOS>
I
dare
<EOS>
say
I
shall
be
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
Then
it
is
as
if
all
the
life
I
have
chosen
to
live
,
all
thoughts
,
all
will
,
forsook
me
and
left
me
alone
in
spots
of
memory
,
and
I
ca
n't
get
away
:
my
pain
seems
to
keep
me
there
.
<EOS>
My
childhood
 
<EOS>
my
girlhood
 
<EOS>
the
day
of
my
marriage
 
the
day
of
my
father
's
death
 
there
seems
to
be
nothing
since
.
<EOS>
Then
a
great
horror
comes
over
me
:
what
do
I
know
of
life
or
death
?
<EOS>
and
what
my
father
called
"
right
"
may
be
a
power
that
is
laying
hold
of
me
 
that
is
clutching
me
now
.
<EOS>
Well
,
I
will
satisfy
him
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
go
into
the
darkness
without
satisfying
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
hidden
what
was
his
.
<EOS>
I
thought
once
I
would
burn
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
burned
it
.
<EOS>
I
thank
God
<EOS>
I
have
not
burned
it
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
threw
herself
on
her
cushions
again
,
visibly
fatigued
.
<EOS>
Deronda
,
moved
too
strongly
by
her
suffering
for
other
impulses
to
act
within
him
,
drew
near
her
,
and
said
,
entreatingly
    
"
Will
you
not
spare
yourself
this
evening
?
<EOS>
Let
us
leave
the
rest
till
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
she
said
decisively
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
confess
it
all
,
now
that
I
have
come
up
to
it
.
<EOS>
Often
when
I
am
at
ease
it
all
fades
away
;
my
whole
self
comes
quite
back
;
but
I
know
it
will
sink
away
again
,
and
the
other
will
come
 
<EOS>
the
poor
,
solitary
,
forsaken
remains
of
self
,
that
can
resist
nothing
.
<EOS>
It
was
my
nature
to
resist
,
and
say
,
"
I
have
a
right
to
resist
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
I
say
so
still
when
I
have
any
strength
in
me
.
<EOS>
You
have
heard
me
say
it
,
and
I
do
n't
withdraw
it
.
<EOS>
But
when
my
strength
goes
,
some
other
right
forces
itself
upon
me
like
iron
in
an
inexorable
hand
;
and
even
when
I
am
at
ease
,
it
is
beginning
to
make
ghosts
upon
the
daylight
.
<EOS>
And
now
you
have
made
it
worse
for
me
,
"
she
said
,
with
a
sudden
return
of
impetuosity
;
"
but
I
shall
have
told
you
everything
.
<EOS>
And
what
reproach
is
there
against
me
,
"
she
added
bitterly
,
"
since
I
have
made
you
glad
to
be
a
Jew
?
<EOS>
Joseph
Kalonymos
reproached
me
:
he
said
you
had
been
turned
into
a
proud
Englishman
,
who
resented
being
touched
by
a
Jew
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
had
!
"
<EOS>
she
ended
,
with
a
new
marvelous
alternation
.
<EOS>
It
was
as
if
her
mind
were
breaking
into
several
,
one
jarring
the
other
into
impulsive
action
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
Joseph
Kalonymos
?
"
said
Deronda
,
with
a
darting
recollection
of
that
Jew
who
touched
his
arm
in
the
Frankfort
synagogue
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
some
vengeance
sent
him
back
from
the
East
,
that
he
might
see
you
and
come
to
reproach
me
.
<EOS>
He
was
my
father
's
friend
.
<EOS>
He
knew
of
your
birth
:
he
knew
of
my
husband
's
death
,
and
once
,
twenty
years
ago
,
after
he
had
been
away
in
the
Levant
,
he
came
to
see
me
and
inquire
about
you
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
that
you
were
dead
:
I
meant
you
to
be
dead
to
all
the
world
of
my
childhood
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
said
that
your
were
living
,
he
would
have
interfered
with
my
plans
:
he
would
have
taken
on
him
to
represent
my
father
,
and
have
tried
to
make
me
recall
what
I
had
done
.
<EOS>
What
could
I
do
but
say
you
were
dead
?
<EOS>
The
act
was
done
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
told
him
of
it
there
would
have
been
trouble
and
scandal
 
and
all
to
conquer
me
,
who
would
not
have
been
conquered
.
<EOS>
I
was
strong
then
,
and
I
would
have
had
my
will
,
though
there
might
have
been
a
hard
fight
against
me
.
<EOS>
I
took
the
way
to
have
it
without
any
fight
.
<EOS>
I
felt
then
that
I
was
not
really
deceiving
:
it
would
have
come
to
the
same
in
the
end
;
or
if
not
to
the
same
,
to
something
worse
.
<EOS>
He
believed
me
and
begged
that
I
would
give
up
to
him
the
chest
that
my
father
had
charged
me
and
my
husband
to
deliver
to
our
eldest
son
.
<EOS>
I
knew
what
was
in
the
chest
 
things
that
had
been
dinned
in
my
ears
since
I
had
had
any
understanding
 
things
that
were
thrust
on
my
mind
that
I
might
feel
them
like
a
wall
around
my
life
 
<EOS>
my
life
that
was
growing
like
a
tree
.
<EOS>
Once
,
after
my
husband
died
,
I
was
going
to
burn
the
chest
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
difficult
to
burn
;
and
burning
a
chest
and
papers
looks
like
a
shameful
act
.
<EOS>
I
have
committed
no
shameful
act
 
except
what
Jews
would
call
shameful
.
<EOS>
I
had
kept
the
chest
,
and
I
gave
it
to
Joseph
Kalonymos
.
<EOS>
He
went
away
mournful
,
and
said
,
"
If
you
marry
again
,
and
if
another
grandson
is
born
to
him
who
is
departed
,
I
will
deliver
up
the
chest
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
bowed
in
silence
.
<EOS>
I
meant
not
to
marry
again
 
no
more
than
I
meant
to
be
the
shattered
woman
that
I
am
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
ceased
speaking
,
and
her
head
sank
back
while
she
looked
vaguely
before
her
.
<EOS>
Her
thought
was
traveling
through
the
years
,
and
when
she
began
to
speak
again
her
voice
had
lost
its
argumentative
spirit
,
and
had
fallen
into
a
veiled
tone
of
distress
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
months
ago
this
Kalonymos
saw
you
in
the
synagogue
at
Frankfort
.
<EOS>
He
saw
you
enter
the
hotel
,
and
he
went
to
ask
your
name
.
<EOS>
There
was
nobody
else
in
the
world
to
whom
the
name
would
have
told
anything
about
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
it
is
not
my
real
name
?
"
said
Deronda
,
with
a
dislike
even
to
this
trifling
part
of
the
disguise
which
had
been
thrown
round
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
as
real
as
another
,
"
said
his
mother
,
indifferently
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Jews
have
always
been
changing
their
names
.
<EOS>
My
father
's
family
had
kept
the
name
of
Charisi
:
my
husband
was
a
Charisi
.
<EOS>
When
I
came
out
as
a
singer
,
we
made
it
Alcharisi
.
<EOS>
But
there
had
been
a
branch
of
the
family
my
father
had
lost
sight
of
who
called
themselves
Deronda
,
and
when
I
wanted
a
name
for
you
,
and
Sir
Hugo
said
,
"
Let
it
be
a
foreign
name
,
"
I
thought
of
Deronda
.
<EOS>
But
Joseph
Kalonymos
had
heard
my
father
speak
of
the
Deronda
branch
,
and
the
name
confirmed
his
suspicion
.
<EOS>
He
began
to
suspect
what
had
been
done
.
<EOS>
It
was
as
if
everything
had
been
whispered
to
him
in
the
air
.
<EOS>
He
found
out
where
I
was
.
<EOS>
He
took
a
journey
into
Russia
to
see
me
;
he
found
me
weak
and
shattered
.
<EOS>
He
had
come
back
again
,
with
his
white
hair
,
and
with
rage
in
his
soul
against
me
.
<EOS>
He
said
I
was
going
down
to
the
grave
clad
in
falsehood
and
robbery
 
falsehood
to
my
father
and
robbery
of
my
own
child
.
<EOS>
He
accused
me
of
having
kept
the
knowledge
of
your
birth
from
you
,
and
having
brought
you
up
as
if
you
had
been
the
son
of
an
English
gentleman
.
<EOS>
Well
,
it
was
true
;
and
twenty
years
before
I
would
have
maintained
that
I
had
a
right
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
maintain
nothing
now
.
<EOS>
No
faith
is
strong
within
me
.
<EOS>
My
father
may
have
God
on
his
side
.
<EOS>
This
man
's
words
were
like
lion
's
teeth
upon
me
.
<EOS>
My
father
's
threats
eat
into
me
with
my
pain
.
<EOS>
If
I
tell
everything
 
if
I
deliver
up
everything
 
what
else
can
be
demanded
of
me
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
make
myself
love
the
people
I
have
never
loved
 
<EOS>
is
it
not
enough
that
I
lost
the
life
I
did
love
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
had
leaned
forward
a
little
in
her
low
-
toned
pleading
,
that
seemed
like
a
smothered
cry
:
her
arms
and
hands
were
stretched
out
at
full
length
,
as
if
strained
in
beseeching
,
Deronda
's
soul
was
absorbed
in
the
anguish
of
compassion
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
mind
now
that
he
had
been
repulsed
before
.
<EOS>
His
pity
made
a
flood
of
forgiveness
within
him
.
<EOS>
His
single
impulse
was
to
kneel
by
her
and
take
her
hand
gently
,
between
his
palms
,
while
he
said
in
that
exquisite
voice
of
soothing
which
expresses
oneness
with
the
sufferer
    
"
Mother
,
take
comfort
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
did
not
seem
inclined
to
repulse
him
now
,
but
looked
down
at
him
and
let
him
take
both
her
hands
to
fold
between
his
.
<EOS>
Gradually
tears
gathered
,
but
she
pressed
her
handkerchief
against
her
eyes
and
then
leaned
her
cheek
against
his
brow
,
as
if
she
wished
that
they
should
not
look
at
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
not
possible
that
I
could
be
near
you
often
and
comfort
you
?
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
He
was
under
that
stress
of
pity
that
propels
us
on
sacrifices
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
possible
,
"
she
answered
,
lifting
up
her
head
again
and
withdrawing
her
hand
as
if
she
wished
him
to
move
away
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
husband
and
five
children
.
<EOS>
None
of
them
know
of
your
existence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
felt
painfully
silenced
.
<EOS>
He
rose
and
stood
at
a
little
distance
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
wonder
why
I
married
,
"
she
went
on
presently
,
under
the
influence
of
a
newly
-
recurring
thought
.
<EOS>
"
I
meant
never
to
marry
again
.
<EOS>
I
meant
to
be
free
and
to
live
for
my
art
.
<EOS>
I
had
parted
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
had
no
bonds
.
<EOS>
For
nine
years
I
was
a
queen
.
<EOS>
I
enjoyed
the
life
I
had
longed
for
.
<EOS>
But
something
befell
me
.
<EOS>
It
was
like
a
fit
of
forgetfulness
.
<EOS>
I
began
to
sing
out
of
tune
.
<EOS>
They
told
me
of
it
.
<EOS>
Another
woman
was
thrusting
herself
in
my
place
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
endure
the
prospect
of
failure
and
decline
.
<EOS>
It
was
horrible
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
She
started
up
again
,
with
a
shudder
,
and
lifted
screening
hands
like
one
who
dreads
missiles
.
<EOS>
"
It
drove
me
to
marry
.
<EOS>
I
made
believe
that
I
preferred
being
the
wife
of
a
Russian
noble
to
being
the
greatest
lyric
actress
of
Europe
;
I
made
believe
 
<EOS>
I
acted
that
part
.
<EOS>
It
was
because
I
felt
my
greatness
sinking
away
from
me
,
as
I
feel
my
life
sinking
now
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
wait
till
men
said
,
"
She
had
better
go
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
sank
into
her
seat
again
,
and
looked
at
the
evening
sky
as
she
went
on
:
"
I
repented
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
resolve
taken
in
desperation
.
<EOS>
That
singing
out
of
tune
was
only
like
a
fit
of
illness
;
it
went
away
.
<EOS>
I
repented
;
but
it
was
too
late
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
go
back
.
<EOS>
All
things
hindered
,
me
 
all
things
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
new
haggardness
had
come
in
her
face
,
but
her
son
refrained
from
again
urging
her
to
leave
further
speech
till
the
morrow
:
there
was
evidently
some
mental
relief
for
her
in
an
outpouring
such
as
she
could
never
have
allowed
herself
before
.
<EOS>
He
stood
still
while
she
maintained
silence
longer
than
she
knew
,
and
the
light
was
perceptibly
fading
.
<EOS>
At
last
she
turned
to
him
and
said
    
"
I
can
bear
no
more
now
.
"
<EOS>
She
put
out
her
hand
,
but
then
quickly
withdrew
it
saying
,
"
Stay
.
<EOS>
How
do
I
know
that
I
can
see
you
again
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
to
be
seen
when
I
am
in
pain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
drew
forth
a
pocket
-
book
,
and
taking
out
a
letter
said
,
"
This
is
addressed
to
the
banking
-
house
in
Mainz
,
where
you
are
to
go
for
your
grandfather
's
chest
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
letter
written
by
Joseph
Kalonymos
:
if
he
is
not
there
himself
,
this
order
of
his
will
be
obeyed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
Deronda
had
taken
the
letter
,
she
said
,
with
effort
but
more
gently
than
before
,
"
Kneel
again
,
and
let
me
kiss
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
obeyed
,
and
holding
his
head
between
her
hands
,
she
kissed
him
solemnly
on
the
brow
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
I
had
no
life
left
to
love
you
with
,
"
she
said
,
in
a
low
murmur
.
"
<EOS>
But
there
is
more
fortune
for
you
.
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
was
to
keep
it
in
reserve
.
<EOS>
I
gave
you
all
your
father
's
fortune
.
<EOS>
They
can
never
accuse
me
of
robbery
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
had
needed
anything
I
would
have
worked
for
you
,
"
said
Deronda
,
conscious
of
disappointed
yearning
 
a
shutting
out
forever
from
long
early
vistas
of
affectionate
imagination
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
need
nothing
that
the
skill
of
man
can
give
me
,
"
said
his
mother
,
still
holding
his
head
,
and
perusing
his
features
.
<EOS>
"
But
perhaps
now
I
have
satisfied
my
father
's
will
,
your
face
will
come
instead
of
his
 
your
young
,
loving
face
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
see
me
again
?
"
said
Deronda
,
anxiously
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
 
perhaps
.
<EOS>
Wait
,
wait
.
<EOS>
Leave
me
now
.

Among
Deronda
's
letters
the
next
morning
was
one
from

MY
DEAR
DERONDA
,
 
<EOS>
In
return
for
your
sketch
of
Italian
movements
and
    
your
view
of
the
world
's
affairs
generally
,
I
may
say
that
here
at
    
home
the
most
judicious
opinion
going
as
to
the
effects
of
present
    
causes
<EOS>
is
that
"
time
will
show
.
"
<EOS>
As
to
the
present
causes
of
past
    
effects
,
it
is
now
seen
that
the
late
swindling
telegrams
account
for
    
the
last
year
's
cattle
plague
 
which
is
a
refutation
of
philosophy
    
falsely
so
called
,
and
justifies
the
compensation
to
the
farmers
.
<EOS>
My
    
own
idea
that
a
murrain
will
shortly
break
out
in
the
commercial
    
class
,
and
that
the
cause
will
subsequently
disclose
itself
in
the
    
ready
sale
of
all
rejected
pictures
,
has
been
called
an
unsound
use
of
    
analogy
;
but
there
are
minds
that
will
not
hesitate
to
rob
even
the
    
neglected
painter
of
his
solace
.
<EOS>
To
my
feeling
there
is
great
beauty
    
in
the
conception
that
some
bad
judge
might
give
a
high
price
for
my
    
Berenice
series
,
and
that
the
men
in
the
city
would
have
already
been
    
punished
for
my
ill
-
merited
luck
.
      
<EOS>
Meanwhile
I
am
consoling
myself
for
your
absence
by
finding
my
    
advantage
in
it
 
shining
like
Hesperus
when
Hyperion
has
departed
;
    
sitting
with
our
Hebrew
prophet
,
and
making
a
study
of
his
head
,
in
    
the
hours
when
he
used
to
be
occupied
with
you
 
getting
credit
with
    
him
as
a
learned
young
Gentile
,
who
would
have
been
a
Jew
if
he
could
      
and
agreeing
with
him
in
the
general
principle
,
that
whatever
is
    
best
is
for
that
reason
Jewish
.
<EOS>
I
never
held
it
<EOS>
my
_
forte
_
to
be
    
a
severe
reasoner
,
but
I
can
see
that
if
whatever
is
best
is
A
,
and
B
    
happens
to
be
best
,
B
must
be
A
<EOS>
,
however
little
you
might
have
    
expected
it
beforehand
.
<EOS>
On
that
principle
I
could
see
the
force
of
a
    
pamphlet
I
once
read
to
prove
that
all
good
art
was
Protestant
.
    
<EOS>
However
,
our
prophet
is
an
uncommonly
interesting
sitter
 
a
better
    
model
than
Rembrandt
had
for
his
Rabbi
 
<EOS>
and
I
never
come
away
from
him
    
without
a
new
discovery
.
<EOS>
For
one
thing
,
it
is
a
constant
wonder
to
me
    
<EOS>
that
,
with
all
his
fiery
feeling
for
his
race
and
their
traditions
,
he
    
is
no
straight
-
laced
Jew
,
spitting
after
the
word
Christian
,
and
    
enjoying
the
prospect
that
the
Gentile
mouth
will
water
in
vain
for
a
    
slice
of
the
roasted
Leviathan
,
while
Israel
will
be
sending
up
plates
    
for
more
,
<EOS>
_
ad
libitum
_
,
(
You
perceive
that
my
studies
had
taught
    
me
what
to
expect
from
the
orthodox
Jew
.
)
<EOS>
I
confess
that
I
have
always
    
held
lightly
by
your
account
of
Mordecai
,
as
apologetic
,
and
merely
    
part
of
your
disposition
to
make
an
antedeluvian
point
of
view
lest
    
you
should
do
injustice
to
the
megatherium
.
<EOS>
But
now
I
have
given
ear
    
to
him
in
his
proper
person
<EOS>
,
I
find
him
really
a
sort
of
    
philosophical
-
allegorical
-
mystical
believer
,
and
yet
with
a
sharp
    
dialectic
point
,
so
that
any
argumentative
rattler
of
peas
in
a
    
bladder
might
soon
be
pricked
in
silence
by
him
.
<EOS>
The
mixture
may
be
    
one
of
the
Jewish
prerogatives
,
for
what
I
know
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
his
mind
    
seems
so
broad
that
I
find
my
own
correct
opinions
lying
in
it
quite
    
commodiously
,
and
how
they
are
to
be
brought
into
agreement
with
the
    
vast
remainder
<EOS>
is
his
affair
,
not
mine
.
<EOS>
I
leave
it
to
him
to
settle
    
our
basis
,
never
yet
having
seen
a
basis
which
is
not
a
    
world
-
supporting
elephant
,
more
or
less
powerful
and
expensive
to
keep
.
    
<EOS>
My
means
will
not
allow
me
to
keep
a
private
elephant
.
<EOS>
I
go
into
mystery
    
instead
,
as
cheaper
and
more
lasting
 
a
sort
of
gas
which
is
likely
to
    
be
continually
supplied
by
the
decomposition
of
the
elephants
.
<EOS>
And
if
    
I
like
the
look
of
an
opinion
,
I
treat
it
civilly
,
without
suspicious
    
inquiries
.
<EOS>
I
have
quite
a
friendly
feeling
toward
Mordecai
's
notion
    
that
a
whole
Christian
is
three
-
fourths
a
Jew
,
and
that
from
the
    
Alexandrian
time
downward
the
most
comprehensive
minds
have
been
    
Jewish
;
for
I
think
of
pointing
out
to
Mirah
that
,
Arabic
and
other
    
incidents
of
life
apart
,
there
is
really
little
difference
between
me
    
and
 
Maimonides
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
lately
been
finding
out
that
it
is
your
    
shallow
lover
who
ca
n't
help
making
a
declaration
.
<EOS>
If
Mirah
's
ways
    
were
less
distracting
,
and
it
were
less
of
a
heaven
to
be
in
her
    
presence
and
watch
her
,
I
must
long
ago
have
flung
myself
at
her
feet
,
    
and
requested
her
to
tell
me
,
with
less
indirectness
,
whether
she
    
wished
me
to
blow
my
brains
out
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
knack
of
hoping
,
which
is
as
    
good
as
an
estate
in
reversion
,
if
one
can
keep
from
the
temptation
of
    
turning
it
into
certainty
,
which
may
spoil
all
.
<EOS>
My
Hope
wanders
among
    
the
orchard
blossoms
,
feels
the
warm
snow
falling
on
it
through
the
    
sunshine
,
and
is
in
doubt
of
nothing
;
but
,
catching
sight
of
Certainty
    
in
the
distance
,
sees
an
ugly
Janus
-
faced
deity
,
with
a
dubious
wink
    
on
the
hither
side
of
him
,
and
turns
quickly
away
.
<EOS>
But
you
,
with
your
    
supreme
reasonableness
,
and
self
-
nullification
,
and
preparation
for
    
the
worst
 
you
know
nothing
about
Hope
,
that
immortal
,
delicious
    
maiden
forever
courted
forever
propitious
,
whom
fools
have
called
    
deceitful
,
as
if
it
were
Hope
that
carried
the
cup
of
disappointment
,
    
whereas
it
is
her
deadly
enemy
,
Certainty
,
whom
she
only
escapes
by
    
transformation
.
<EOS>
(
You
observe
my
new
vein
of
allegory
?
)
<EOS>
Seriously
,
    
however
,
I
must
be
permitted
to
allege
that
truth
will
prevail
,
that
    
prejudice
will
melt
before
it
,
that
diversity
,
accompanied
by
merit
,
    
will
make
itself
felt
as
fascination
,
and
that
no
virtuous
aspiration
    
will
be
frustrated
 
all
which
,
if
I
mistake
not
,
are
doctrines
of
the
    
schools
,
and
they
imply
that
the
Jewess
I
prefer
will
prefer
me
.
<EOS>
Any
    
blockhead
can
cite
generalities
,
but
the
mind
-
master
discerns
the
    
particular
cases
they
represent
.
      
<EOS>
I
am
less
convinced
that
my
society
makes
amends
to
Mordecai
for
your
    
absence
,
but
another
substitute
occasionally
comes
in
the
form
of
    
Jacob
Cohen
.
<EOS>
It
is
worth
while
to
catch
our
prophet
's
expression
when
    
he
has
that
remarkable
type
of
young
Israel
on
his
knee
,
and
pours
    
forth
some
Semitic
inspiration
with
a
sublime
look
of
melancholy
    
patience
and
devoutness
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
it
occurs
to
Jacob
that
Hebrew
will
    
be
more
edifying
to
him
if
he
stops
his
ears
with
his
palms
,
and
    
imitates
the
venerable
sounds
as
heard
through
that
muffled
medium
.
    
<EOS>
When
Mordecai
gently
draws
down
the
little
fists
and
holds
them
fast
,
    
Jacob
's
features
all
take
on
an
extraordinary
activity
,
very
much
as
    
if
he
was
walking
through
a
menagerie
and
trying
to
imitate
every
    
animal
in
turn
,
succeeding
best
with
the
owl
and
the
peccary
.
<EOS>
But
I
    
dare
say
you
have
seen
something
of
this
.
<EOS>
He
treats
me
with
the
    
easiest
familiarity
,
and
seems
in
general
to
look
at
me
as
a
second
-
hand
    
Christian
commodity
,
likely
to
come
down
in
price
;
remarking
on
    
my
disadvantages
with
a
frankness
which
seems
to
imply
some
thoughts
    
of
future
purchase
.
<EOS>
It
is
pretty
,
though
,
to
see
the
change
in
him
if
    
Mirah
happens
to
come
in
.
<EOS>
He
turns
child
suddenly
 
his
age
usually
    
strikes
one
as
being
like
the
Israelitish
garments
in
the
desert
,
    
perhaps
near
forty
,
yet
with
an
air
of
recent
production
.
<EOS>
But
,
with
    
Mirah
,
he
reminds
me
of
the
dogs
that
have
been
brought
up
by
women
,
    
and
remain
manageable
by
them
only
.
<EOS>
Still
,
the
dog
is
fond
of
Mordecai
    
too
,
and
brings
sugar
-
plums
to
share
with
him
,
filling
his
own
mouth
    
to
rather
an
embarrassing
extent
,
and
watching
how
Mordecai
deals
with
    
a
smaller
supply
.
<EOS>
Judging
from
this
modern
Jacob
at
the
age
of
six
,
my
    
astonishment
is
that
his
race
has
not
bought
us
all
up
long
ago
,
and
    
pocketed
our
feebler
generations
in
the
form
of
stock
and
scrip
,
as
so
    
much
slave
property
.
<EOS>
There
is
one
Jewess
I
should
not
mind
being
slave
    
to
.
<EOS>
But
I
wish
I
did
not
imagine
that
Mirah
gets
a
little
sadder
,
and
    
tries
all
the
while
to
hide
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
natural
enough
,
of
course
,
while
    
she
has
to
watch
the
slow
death
of
this
brother
,
whom
she
has
taken
to
    
worshipping
with
such
looks
of
loving
devoutness
that
I
am
ready
to
    
wish
myself
in
his
place
.
      
<EOS>
For
the
rest
,
we
are
a
little
merrier
than
usual
.

you
    
remember
a
head
you
admired
among
my
sketches
,
a
fellow
with
a
good
    
upper
lip
,
reading
law
 
has
got
some
rooms
in
town
now
not
far
off
us
,
    
and
has
had
a
neat
sister
(
upper
lip
also
good
)
staying
with
him
<EOS>
the
    
last
fortnight
.
<EOS>
I
have
introduced
them
both
to
my
mother
and
the
    
girls
,
who
have
found
out
from
Miss
Gascoigne
that
she
is
cousin
to
    
your
Vandyke
duchess
!
!
!
<EOS>
I
put
the
notes
of
exclamation
to
mark
the
    
surprise
that
the
information
at
first
produced
on
my
feeble
    
understanding
.
<EOS>
On
reflection
I
discovered
that
there
was
not
the
least
    
ground
for
surprise
,
unless
I
had
beforehand
believed
that
nobody
    
could
be
anybody
's
cousin
without
my
knowing
it
.
<EOS>
This
sort
of
    
surprise
,
I
take
it
,
depends
on
a
liveliness
of
the
spine
,
with
a
more
    
or
less
constant
nullity
of
brain
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
fellow
I
used
to
meet
    
at
Rome
who
was
in
an
effervescence
of
surprise
at
contact
with
the
    
simplest
information
.
<EOS>
Tell
him
what
you
would
 
that
you
were
fond
of
    
easy
boots
 
<EOS>
he
would
always
say
,
"
No
!
are
you
?
"
<EOS>
with
the
same
energy
    
of
wonder
:
the
very
fellow
of
whom
pastoral
Browne
wrote
    
prophetically
          
"
A
wretch
so
empty
that
if
e'er
there
be
      
<EOS>
In
nature
found
the
least
vacuity
      
<EOS>
'
Twill
be
in
him
.
"
      
<EOS>
I
have
accounted
for
it
all
 
he
had
a
lively
spine
.
      
<EOS>
However
,
this
cousinship
with
the
duchess
came
out
by
chance
one
day
    
that
Mirah
was
with
them
at
home
<EOS>
and
they
were
talking
about
the
    
Mallingers
.
<EOS>
_
Apropos
_
;
I
am
getting
so
important
that
I
have
    
rival
invitations
.
<EOS>
Gascoigne
wants
me
to
go
down
with
him
to
his
    
father
's
rectory
in
August
and
see
the
country
round
there
.
<EOS>
But
I
    
think
self
-
interest
well
understood
will
take
me
to
Topping
Abbey
,
for
    
Sir
Hugo
has
invited
me
,
and
proposes
 
God
bless
him
for
his
rashness
!
      
<EOS>
that
I
should
make
a
picture
of
his
three
daughters
sitting
on
a
    
bank
 
as
he
says
,
in
the
Gainsborough
style
.
<EOS>
He
came
to
my
studio
the
    
other
day
and
recommended
me
to
apply
myself
to
portrait
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
    
know
what
that
means
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
good
fellow
,
your
attempts
at
the
historic
    
and
poetic
are
simply
pitiable
.
<EOS>
Your
brush
is
just
that
of
a
    
successful
portrait
-
painter
 
<EOS>
it
has
a
little
truth
and
a
great
    
facility
in
falsehood
 
<EOS>
your
idealism
will
never
do
for
gods
and
    
goddesses
and
heroic
story
,
but
it
may
fetch
a
high
price
as
flattery
.
    
<EOS>
Fate
,
my
friend
,
has
made
you
the
hinder
wheel
 
<EOS>

<EOS>
run

because
you
ca
n't

it

"
      
<EOS>
What
great
effort
it
evidently
costs
our
friends
to
give
us
these
    
candid
opinions
!
<EOS>
I
have
even
known
a
man
to
take
the
trouble
to
call
,
    
in
order
to
tell
me
that
I
had
irretrievably
exposed
my
want
of
    
judgment
in
treating
my
subject
,
and
that
if
I
had
asked
him
we
would
    
have
lent
me
his
own
judgment
.
<EOS>
Such
was
my
ingratitude
and
my
    
readiness
at
composition
,
that
even
while
he
was
speaking
I
inwardly
    
sketched
a
Last
Judgment
with
that
candid
friend
's
physiognomy
on
the
    
left
.
<EOS>
But
all
this
is
away
from
Sir
Hugo
,
whose
manner
of
implying
    
that
one
's
gifts
are
not
of
the
highest
order
<EOS>
is
so
exceedingly
    
good
-
natured
and
comfortable
that
I
begin
to
feel
it
an
advantage
not
    
to
be
among
those
poor
fellows
at
the
tip
-
top
.
<EOS>
And
his
kindness
to
me
    
tastes
all
the
better
because
it
comes
out
of
his
love
for
you
,
old
    
boy
.
<EOS>
His
chat
is
uncommonly
amusing
.
<EOS>
By
the
way
,
he
told
me
that
your
    
Vandyke
duchess
is
gone
with
her
husband
yachting
to
the
Mediterranean
.
    
<EOS>
I
bethink
me
that
it
is
possible
to
land
from
a
yacht
,
or
to
be
taken
    
on
to
a
yacht
from
the
land
.
<EOS>
Shall
you
by
chance
have
an
opportunity
of
    
continuing
your
theological
discussion
with
<EOS>
the
fair
Supralapsarian
 
I
    
think
you
said
her
tenets
were
of
that
complexion
?
<EOS>
Is
Duke
Alphonso
    
also
theological
?
 
<EOS>
perhaps
an
Arian
who
objects
to
triplicity
.
<EOS>
(
Stage
    
direction

<EOS>
While
D.
is
reading
,
a
profound
scorn
gathers
in
his
face
    
till
at
the
last
word
he
flings
down
the
letter
,
grasps
his
coat
-
collar
    
in
a
statuesque
attitude
and
so
remains
with
a
look
generally
    
tremendous
,
throughout
the
following
soliloquy
,
"
O
night

O
blackness

<EOS>
Excuse
the
brevity
of
this
letter
.
<EOS>
You
are
not
used
to
more
from
me
    
than
a
bare
statement
of
facts
,
without
comment
or
digression
.
<EOS>
One
    
fact
I
have
omitted
 
that
the
Klesmers
on
the
eve
of
departure
have
    
behaved
magnificently
,
shining
forth
as
might
be
expected
from
the
    
planets
of
genius
and
fortune
in
conjunction
.
<EOS>
Mirah
is
rich
with
their
    
oriental
gifts
.
      
<EOS>
What
luck
it
will
be
if
you
come
back
and
present
yourself
at
the
    
Abbey
while
I
am
there
!
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
behave
with
consummate
    
discretion
and
win
golden
opinions
,
But
I
shall
run
up
to
town
now
and
    
then
,
just
for
a
peep
into
Gad
Eden
.
<EOS>
You
see
how
far
I
have
got
in
    
<EOS>
Hebrew
lore
 
<EOS>
up
with
my
Lord
Bolingbroke
,
who
knew
no
Hebrew
,
but
    
"
understood
that
sort
of
learning
and
what
is
writ
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
If
Mirah
    
commanded
,
I
would
go
to
a
depth
below
the
tri
-
literal
roots
.
<EOS>
Already
    
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
whether
the
points
are
there
or
not
.
<EOS>
But
    
while
her
brother
's
life
lasts
I
suspect
she
would
not
listen
to
a
    
lover
,
even
one
whose
"
hair
is
like
a
flock
of
goats
on
Mount
    
Gilead
"
 
<EOS>
and
I
flatter
myself
that
few
heads
would
bear
that
trying
    
comparison
better
than
mine
.
<EOS>
So
I
stay
with
my
hope
among
the
    
orchard
-
blossoms
.
      
<EOS>
Your
devoted
,
      
HANS
MEYRICK
.
  
<EOS>
Some
months
before
,
this
letter
from
Hans
would
have
divided
Deronda
's
thoughts
irritatingly
:
<EOS>
its
romancing
,
about
Mirah
would
have
had
an
unpleasant
edge
,
scarcely
anointed
with
any
commiseration
for
his
friend
's
probable
disappointment
.
<EOS>
But
things
had
altered
since
March
.
<EOS>
Mirah
was
no
longer
so
critically
placed
with
regard
to
the
Meyricks
,
and
Deronda
's
own
position
had
been
undergoing
a
change
which
had
just
been
crowned
by
the
revelation
of
his
birth
.
<EOS>
The
new
opening
toward
the
future
,
though
he
would
not
trust
in
any
definite
visions
,
inevitably
shed
new
lights
,
and
influenced
his
mood
toward
past
and
present
;
hence
,
what
Hans
called
his
hope
now
seemed
to
Deronda
,
not
a
mischievous
unreasonableness
which
roused
his
indignation
,
but
an
unusually
persistent
bird
-
dance
of
an
extravagant
fancy
,
and
he
would
have
felt
quite
able
to
pity
any
consequent
suffering
of
his
friend
's
,
if
he
had
believed
in
the
suffering
as
probable
.
<EOS>
But
some
of
the
busy
thought
filling
that
long
day
,
which
passed
without
his
receiving
any
new
summons
from
his
mother
,
was
given
to
the
argument
that
Hans
Meyrick
's
nature
was
not
one
in
which
love
could
strike
the
deep
roots
that
turn
disappointment
into
sorrow
:
it
was
too
restless
,
too
readily
excitable
by
novelty
,
too
ready
to
turn
itself
into
imaginative
material
,
and
wear
its
grief
as
a
fantastic
costume
.
"
<EOS>
Already
he
is
beginning
to
play
at
love
:
he
is
taking
the
whole
affair
as
a
comedy
,
"
said
Deronda
to
himself
;
"
he
knows
very
well
that
there
is
no
chance
for
him
.
<EOS>
Just
like
him
 
never
opening
his
eyes
on
any
possible
objection
I
could
have
to
receive
his
outpourings
about
Mirah
.
<EOS>
Poor
old
Hans
!
<EOS>
If
we
were
under
a
fiery
hail
together
he
would
howl
like
a
Greek
,
and
if
I
did
not
howl
too
<EOS>
it
would
never
occur
to
him
that
I
was
as
badly
off
as
he
.
<EOS>
And
yet
he
is
tender
-
hearted
and
affectionate
in
intention
,
and
I
ca
n't
say
that
he
is
not
active
in
imagining
what
goes
on
in
other
people
 
<EOS>
but
then
he
always
imagines
it
to
fit
his
own
inclination
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
this
touch
of
causticity
Deronda
got
rid
of
the
slight
heat
at
present
raised
by
Hans
's
naive
expansiveness
.
<EOS>
The
nonsense
about
Gwendolen
,
conveying
the
fact
that
she
was
gone
yachting
with
her
husband
,
only
suggested
a
disturbing
sequel
to
his
own
strange
parting
with
her
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
one
sentence
in
the
letter
which
raised
a
more
immediate
,
active
anxiety
.
<EOS>
Hans
's
suspicion
of
a
hidden
sadness
in
Mirah
was
not
in
the
direction
of
his
wishes
,
and
hence
,
instead
of
distrusting
his
observation
here
,
Deronda
began
to
conceive
a
cause
for
the
sadness
.
<EOS>
Was
it
some
event
that
had
occurred
during
his
absence
,
or
only
the
growing
fear
of
some
event
?
<EOS>
Was
it
something
,
perhaps
alterable
,
in
the
new
position
which
had
been
made
for
her
?
<EOS>
Or
 
had
Mordecai
,
against
his
habitual
resolve
,
communicated
to
her
those
peculiar
cherished
hopes
about
him
,
Deronda
,
and
had
her
quickly
sensitive
nature
been
hurt
by
the
discovery
that
her
brother
's
will
or
tenacity
of
visionary
conviction
had
acted
coercively
on
their
friendship
 
been
hurt
by
the
fear
that
there
was
more
of
pitying
self
-
suppression
than
of
equal
regard
in
Deronda
's
relation
to
him
?
<EOS>
For
amidst
all
Mirah
's
quiet
renunciation
,
the
evident
thirst
of
soul
with
which
she
received
the
tribute
of
equality
implied
a
corresponding
pain
if
she
found
that
what
she
had
taken
for
a
purely
reverential
regard
toward
her
brother
had
its
mixture
of
condescension
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
last
conjecture
of
Deronda
's
he
was
not
wrong
as
to
the
quality
in
Mirah
's
nature
on
which
he
was
founding
 
the
latent
protest
against
the
treatment
she
had
all
her
life
being
subject
to
until
she
met
him
.
<EOS>
For
that
gratitude
which
would
not
let
her
pass
by
any
notice
of
their
acquaintance
without
insisting
on
the
depth
of
her
debt
to
him
,
took
half
its
fervor
from
the
keen
comparison
with
what
others
had
thought
enough
to
render
to
her
.
<EOS>
Deronda
's
affinity
in
feeling
enabled
him
to
penetrate
such
secrets
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
not
near
the
truth
in
admitting
the
idea
that
Mordecai
had
broken
his
characteristic
reticence
.
<EOS>
To
no
soul
<EOS>
but
Deronda
himself
had
he
yet
breathed
the
history
of
their
relation
to
each
other
,
or
his
confidence
about
his
friend
's
origin
:
it
was
not
only
that
these
subjects
were
for
him
too
sacred
to
be
spoken
of
without
weighty
reason
,
but
that
he
had
discerned
Deronda
's
shrinking
at
any
mention
of
his
birth
;
and
the
severity
of
reserve
which
had
hindered
Mordecai
from
answering
a
question
on
a
private
affair
of
the
Cohen
family
told
yet
more
strongly
here
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ezra
,
how
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
Mirah
one
day
said
to
him
 
"
I
am
continually
going
to
speak
to
Mr.
Deronda
as
if
he
were
a
Jew
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
smiled
at
her
quietly
,
and
said
,
"
I
suppose
it
is
because
he
treats
us
as
if
he
were
our
brother
.
<EOS>
But
he
loves
not
to
have
the
difference
of
birth
dwelt
upon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
never
lived
with
his
parents
,
Mr.
Hans
,
says
,
"
continued
Mirah
,
to
whom
this
was
necessarily
a
question
of
interest
about
every
one
for
whom
she
had
a
regard
.
  
<EOS>
"
Seek
not
to
know
such
things
from
Mr.
Hans
,
"
said
Mordecai
,
gravely
,
laying
his
hand
on
her
curls
,
as
he
was
wo
nt
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
Daniel
Deronda
wishes
us
to
know
about
himself
is
for
him
to
tell
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
Mirah
felt
herself
rebuked
,
as
Deronda
had
done
.
<EOS>
But
to
be
rebuked
in
this
way
by
Mordecai
made
her
rather
proud
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
no
one
so
great
as
my
brother
,
"
she
said
to
Mrs.
Meyrick
one
day
that
she
called
at
the
Chelsea
house
on
her
way
home
,
and
,
according
to
her
hope
,
found
the
little
mother
alone
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
difficult
to
think
that
he
belongs
to
the
same
world
as
those
people
I
used
to
live
amongst
.
<EOS>
I
told
you
once
that
they
made
life
seem
like
a
madhouse
;
but
when
I
am
with
Ezra
he
makes
me
feel
that
his
life
is
a
great
good
,
though
he
has
suffered
so
much
;
not
like
me
,
who
wanted
to
die
because
I
had
suffered
a
little
,
and
only
for
a
little
while
.
<EOS>
His
soul
is
so
full
,
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
wish
for
death
as
I
did
.
<EOS>
I
get
the
same
sort
of
feeling
from
him
that
I
got
yesterday
,
when
I
was
tired
,
and
came
home
through
the
park
after
the
sweet
rain
had
fallen
and
the
sunshine
lay
on
the
grass
and
flowers
.
<EOS>
Everything
in
the
sky
and
under
the
sky
looked
so
pure
and
beautiful
that
the
weariness
and
trouble
and
folly
seemed
only
a
small
part
of
what
is
,
and
I
became
more
patient
and
hopeful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
A
dove
-
like
note
of
melancholy
in
this
speech
caused
Mrs.
Meyrick
to
look
at
Mirah
with
new
examination
.
<EOS>
After
laying
down
her
hat
and
pushing
her
curls
flat
,
with
an
air
of
fatigue
,
she
placed
herself
on
a
chair
opposite
her
friend
in
her
habitual
attitude
,
her
feet
and
hands
just
crossed
;
and
at
a
distance
she
might
have
seemed
a
colored
statue
of
serenity
.
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Meyrick
discerned
a
new
look
of
suppressed
suffering
in
her
face
,
which
corresponded
to
the
hint
that
to
be
patient
and
hopeful
required
some
extra
influence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
there
any
fresh
trouble
on
your
mind
,
my
dear
?
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
giving
up
her
needlework
as
a
sign
of
concentrated
attention
.
  
<EOS>
Mirah
hesitated
before
she
said
,
"
I
am
too
ready
to
speak
of
troubles
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
It
seems
unkind
to
put
anything
painful
into
other
people
's
minds
,
unless
one
were
sure
it
would
hinder
something
worse
.
<EOS>
And
perhaps
I
am
too
hasty
and
fearful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
dear
,
mothers
are
made
to
like
pain
and
trouble
for
the
sake
of
their
children
.
<EOS>
Is
it
because
the
singing
lessons
are
so
few
,
and
are
likely
to
fall
off
when
the
season
comes
to
an
end
?
<EOS>
Success
in
these
things
ca
n't
come
all
at
once
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Meyrick
did
not
believe
that
she
was
touching
the
real
grief
;
but
a
guess
that
could
be
corrected
would
make
an
easier
channel
for
confidence
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
that
,
"
said
Mirah
,
shaking
her
head
gently
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
a
little
disappointed
because
so
many
ladies
said
they
wanted
me
to
give
them
or
<EOS>
their
daughters
lessons
,
and
<EOS>
then
I
never
heard
of
them
again
,
But
perhaps
after
the
holidays
I
shall
teach
in
some
schools
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
you
know
,
I
am
as
rich
as
a
princess
now
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
touched
the
hundred
pounds
that
Mrs.
Klesmer
gave
me
;
and
I
should
never
be
afraid
that
Ezra
would
be
in
want
of
anything
,
because
there
is
Mr.
Deronda
,
"
and
he
said
,
"
It
is
the
chief
honor
of
my
life
that
your
brother
will
share
anything
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
no
!
<EOS>
Ezra
and
I
can
have
no
fears
for
each
other
about
such
things
as
food
and
clothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
there
is
some
other
fear
on
your
mind
,
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
not
without
divination
 
"
a
fear
of
something
that
may
disturb
your
peace
;
Do
n't
be
forecasting
evil
,
dear
child
,
unless
it
is
what
you
can
guard
against
.
<EOS>
Anxiety
is
good
for
nothing
if
we
ca
n't
turn
it
into
a
defense
.
<EOS>
But
there
's
no
defense
against
all
the
things
that
might
be
.
<EOS>
Have
you
any
more
reason
for
being
anxious
now
than
you
had
a
month
ago
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
have
,
"
said
Mirah
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
kept
it
from
Ezra
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
dared
to
tell
him
.
<EOS>
Pray
forgive
me
that
I
ca
n't
do
without
telling
you
.
<EOS>
I
_
have
_
more
reason
for
being
anxious
.
<EOS>
It
is
five
days
ago
now
.
<EOS>
I
am
quite
sure
I
saw
my
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Meyrick
shrank
into
a
smaller
space
,
packing
her
arms
across
her
chest
and
leaning
forward
 
to
hinder
herself
from
pelting
that
father
with
her
worst
epithets
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
year
has
changed
him
,
"
Mirah
went
on
.
"
<EOS>
He
had
already
been
much
altered
and
worn
in
the
time
before
I
left
him
.
<EOS>
You
remember
I
said
how
he
used
sometimes
to
cry
.
<EOS>
He
was
always
excited
one
way
or
the
other
.
<EOS>
I
have
told
Ezra
everything
that
I
told
you
,
and
he
says
that
my
father
had
taken
to
gambling
,
which
makes
people
easily
distressed
,
and
then
again
exalted
.
<EOS>
And
now
 
it
was
only
a
moment
that
I
saw
him
 
his
face
was
more
haggard
,
and
his
clothes
were
shabby
.
<EOS>
He
was
with
a
much
worse
-
looking
man
,
who
carried
something
,
and
they
were
hurrying
along
after
an
omnibus
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
child
,
he
did
not
see
you
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
I
had
just
come
from
Mrs.
Raymond
's
,
and
I
was
waiting
to
cross
near
the
Marble
Arch
.
<EOS>
Soon
he
was
on
the
omnibus
and
gone
out
of
sight
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
dreadful
moment
.
<EOS>
My
old
life
seemed
to
have
come
back
again
,
and
it
was
worse
than
it
had
ever
been
before
.
<EOS>
And
I
could
not
help
feeling
it
a
new
deliverance
that
he
was
gone
out
of
sight
without
knowing
that
I
was
there
.
<EOS>
And
yet
it
hurt
me
that
I
was
feeling
<EOS>
so
 
it
seemed
hateful
in
me
 
almost
like
words
I
once
had
to
speak
in
a
play
,
that
"
I
had
warmed
my
hands
in
the
blood
of
my
kindred
.
<EOS>
"
For
where
might
my
father
be
going
?
<EOS>
What
may
become
of
him
?
<EOS>
And
his
having
a
daughter
who
would
own
him
in
spite
of
all
,
might
have
hindered
the
worst
.
<EOS>
Is
there
any
pain
like
seeing
what
ought
to
be
the
best
things
in
life
turned
into
the
worst
?
<EOS>
All
those
opposite
feelings
were
meeting
and
pressing
against
each
other
,
and
took
up
all
my
strength
.
<EOS>
No
one
could
act
that
.
<EOS>
Acting
is
slow
and
poor
to
what
we
go
through
within
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
I
called
a
cab
.
<EOS>
I
only
remember
that
I
was
in
it
when
I
began
to
think
,
"
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
Ezra
;
he
must
not
know
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
are
afraid
of
grieving
him
?
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Meyrick
asked
,
when
Mirah
had
paused
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
 
<EOS>
and
there
is
something
more
,
"
said
Mirah
,
hesitatingly
,
as
if
she
were
examining
her
feeling
before
she
would
venture
to
speak
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
tell
you
;
I
can
not
tell
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
have
told
my
own
mother
:
I
should
have
closed
it
up
before
her
.
<EOS>
I
feel
shame
for
my
father
,
and
it
is
perhaps
strange
 
<EOS>
but
the
shame
is
greater
before
Ezra
than
before
any
one
else
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
He
desired
me
to
tell
him
all
about
my
life
,
and
I
obeyed
him
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
always
like
a
smart
to
me
to
know
that
those
things
about
my
father
are
in
Ezra
's
mind
.
<EOS>
And
 
can
you
believe
it
?
<EOS>
when
the
thought
haunts
me
how
it
would
be
if
my
father
were
to
come
and
show
himself
before
us
both
,
what
seems
as
if
it
would
scorch
me
most
is
seeing
my
father
shrinking
before
Ezra
.
<EOS>
That
is
the
truth
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
whether
it
is
a
right
feeling
.
<EOS>
But
I
ca
n't
help
thinking
that
I
would
rather
try
to
maintain
my
father
in
secret
,
and
bear
a
great
deal
in
that
way
,
if
I
could
hinder
him
from
meeting
my
brother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
encourage
that
feeling
,
Mirah
,
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
hastily
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
very
dangerous
;
it
would
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
have
concealment
of
that
sort
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
ought
I
now
to
tell
Ezra
that
I
have
seen
my
father
?
"
said
Mirah
,
with
deprecation
in
her
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
Mrs.
Meyrick
answered
,
dubitatively
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
it
is
necessary
to
do
that
.
<EOS>
Your
father
may
go
away
with
the
birds
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
clear
that
he
came
after
you
;
you
may
never
see
him
again
.
<EOS>
And
then
your
brother
will
have
been
spared
a
useless
anxiety
.
<EOS>
But
promise
me
that
if
your
father
sees
you
 
gets
hold
of
you
in
any
way
again
 
<EOS>
and
you
will
let
us
all
know
.
<EOS>
Promise
me
that
solemnly
,
Mirah
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
right
to
ask
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mirah
reflected
a
little
,
then
leaned
forward
to
put
her
hands
in
Mrs.
Meyrick
's
,
and
said
,
"
Since
you
ask
it
,
I
do
promise
.
<EOS>
I
will
bear
this
feeling
of
shame
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
so
long
used
to
think
that
I
must
bear
that
sort
of
inward
pain
.
<EOS>
But
the
shame
for
my
father
burns
me
more
when
I
think
of
his
meeting
Ezra
.
<EOS>
"
She
was
silent
a
moment
or
two
,
and
then
said
,
in
a
new
tone
of
yearning
compassion
,
"
<EOS>
And
we
are
his
children
 
<EOS>
and
he
was
once
young
like
us
 
and
<EOS>
my
mother
loved
him
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
seeing
it
all
close
,
and
it
hurts
me
like
a
cruelty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mirah
shed
no
tears
<EOS>
:
the
discipline
of
her
whole
life
had
been
against
indulgence
in
such
manifestation
,
which
soon
falls
under
the
control
of
strong
motives
;
but
it
seemed
that
the
more
intense
expression
of
sorrow
had
entered
into
her
voice
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
with
all
her
quickness
and
loving
insight
,
did
not
quite
understand
that
filial
feeling
in
Mirah
which
had
active
roots
deep
below
her
indignation
for
the
worst
offenses
.
<EOS>
She
could
conceive
that
a
mother
would
have
a
clinging
pity
and
shame
for
a
reprobate
son
,
but
she
was
out
of
patience
with
what
she
held
an
exaggerated
susceptibility
on
behalf
of
this
father
,
whose
reappearance
inclined
her
to
wish
him
under
the
care
of
a
turnkey
.
<EOS>
Mirah
's
promise
,
however
,
was
some
security
against
her
weakness
.
  
<EOS>
That
incident
was
the
only
reason
that
Mirah
herself
could
have
stated
for
the
hidden
sadness
which
Hans
had
divined
.
<EOS>
Of
one
element
in
her
changed
mood
she
could
have
given
no
definite
account
:
it
was
something
as
dim
as
the
sense
of
approaching
weather
-
change
,
and
had
extremely
slight
external
promptings
,
such
as
we
are
often
ashamed
to
find
all
we
can
allege
in
support
of
the
busy
constructions
that
go
on
within
us
,
not
only
without
effort
,
but
even
against
it
,
under
the
influence
of
any
blind
emotional
stirring
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
first
leaven
of
uneasiness
was
laid
by
Gwendolen
's
behavior
on
that
visit
which
was
entirely
superfluous
as
a
means
of
engaging
Mirah
to
sing
,
and
could
have
no
other
motive
than
the
excited
and
strange
questioning
about
Deronda
.
<EOS>
Mirah
had
instinctively
kept
the
visit
a
secret
,
but
the
active
remembrance
of
it
had
raised
a
new
susceptibility
in
her
,
and
made
her
alive
as
she
had
never
been
before
to
the
relations
Deronda
must
have
with
that
society
which
she
herself
was
getting
frequent
glimpses
of
without
belonging
to
it
.
<EOS>
Her
peculiar
life
and
education
had
produced
in
her
an
extraordinary
mixture
of
unworldliness
,
with
knowledge
of
the
world
's
evil
,
and
even
this
knowledge
was
a
strange
blending
of
direct
observation
with
the
effects
of
reading
and
theatrical
study
.
<EOS>
Her
memory
was
furnished
with
abundant
passionate
situation
and
intrigue
,
which
she
never
made
emotionally
her
own
,
but
felt
a
repelled
aloofness
from
,
as
she
had
done
from
the
actual
life
around
her
.
<EOS>
Some
of
that
imaginative
knowledge
began
now
to
weave
itself
around
Mrs.
Grandcourt
;
and
though
Mirah
would
admit
no
position
likely
to
affect
her
reverence
for
Deronda
,
she
could
not
avoid
a
new
painfully
vivid
association
of
his
general
life
with
a
world
away
from
her
own
,
where
there
might
be
some
involvement
of
his
feeling
and
action
with
a
woman
like
Gwendolen
,
who
was
increasingly
repugnant
to
her
 
increasingly
,
even
after
she
had
ceased
to
see
her
;
for
liking
and
disliking
can
grow
in
meditation
as
fast
as
in
the
more
immediate
kind
of
presence
.
<EOS>
Any
disquietude
consciously
due
to
the
idea
that
Deronda
's
deepest
care
might
be
for
something
remote
not
only
from
herself
but
even
from
his
friendship
for
her
brother
<EOS>
,
she
would
have
checked
with
rebuking
questions
:
 
<EOS>
What
was
she
but
one
who
had
shared
his
generous
kindness
with
many
others
?
<EOS>
and
his
attachment
to
her
brother
,
was
it
not
begun
late
to
be
soon
ended
?
<EOS>
Other
ties
had
come
before
,
and
others
would
remain
after
this
had
been
cut
by
swift
-
coming
death
.
<EOS>
But
her
uneasiness
had
not
reached
that
point
of
self
-
recognition
in
which
she
would
have
been
ashamed
of
it
as
an
indirect
,
presumptuous
claim
on
Deronda
's
feeling
.
<EOS>
That
she
or
any
one
else
should
think
of
him
as
her
possible
lover
was
a
conception
which
had
never
entered
her
mind
;
indeed
it
was
equally
out
of
the
question
with
Mrs.
Meyrick
and
the
girls
,
who
with
Mirah
herself
regarded
his
intervention
in
her
life
as
something
exceptional
,
and
were
so
impressed
by
his
mission
as
her
deliverer
and
guardian
that
they
would
have
held
it
an
offense
to
him
at
his
holding
any
other
relation
toward
her
:
<EOS>
a
point
of
view
which
Hans
also
had
readily
adopted
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
little
hard
upon
some
men
that
they
appear
to
sink
for
us
in
becoming
lovers
.
<EOS>
But
precisely
to
this
innocence
of
the
Meyricks
was
owing
the
disturbance
of
Mirah
's
unconsciousness
.
<EOS>
The
first
occasion
could
hardly
have
been
more
trivial
,
but
it
prepared
her
emotive
nature
for
a
deeper
effect
from
what
happened
afterward
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
when
Anna
Gascoigne
,
visiting
the
Meyricks
;
was
led
to
speak
of
her
cousinship
with
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
The
visit
had
been
arranged
that
Anna
might
see
Mirah
;
the
three
girls
were
at
home
with
their
mother
,
and
there
was
naturally
a
flux
of
talk
among
six
feminine
creatures
,
free
from
the
presence
of
a
distorting
male
standard

Anna
Gascoigne
felt
herself
much
at
home
with
the
Meyrick
girls
,
who
knew
what
it
was
to
have
a
brother
,
and
to
be
generally
regarded
as
of
minor
importance
in
the
world
;
and
she
had
told
Rex
that
she
thought
the
University
very
nice
,
because
brothers
made
friends
there
whose
families
were
not
rich
and
grand
,
and
yet
(
like
the
University
)
were
very
nice
.
<EOS>
The
Meyricks
seemed
to
her
almost
alarmingly
clever
,
and
she
consulted
them
much
on
the
best
mode
of
teaching
Lotta
,
confiding
to
them
that
she
herself
was
the
least
clever
of
her
family
.
<EOS>
Mirah
had
lately
come
in
,
and
there
was
a
complete
bouquet
of
young
faces
around
the
tea
-
table
 
Hafiz
,
seated
a
little
aloft
with
large
eyes
on
the
alert
,
regarding
the
whole
scene
as
an
apparatus
for
supplying
his
allowance
of
milk
.
  
<EOS>
"
Think
of
our
surprise
,
Mirah
,
"
said
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
We
were
speaking
of
Mr.
Deronda
and
the
Mallingers
,
and
it
turns
out
that
Miss
Gascoigne
knows
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
knew
about
them
,
"
said
Anna
,
a
little
flushed
with
excitement
,
what
she
had
heard
and
now
saw
of
the
lovely
Jewess
being
an
almost
startling
novelty
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
even
seen
them
.
<EOS>
But
some
months
ago
,
my
cousin
married
Sir
Hugo
Mallinger
's
nephew
,
Mr.
Grandcourt
,
who
lived
in
Sir
Hugo
's
place
at
Diplow
,
near
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
There
!
"
exclaimed
Mab
,
clasping
her
hands
.
<EOS>
"
Something
must
come
of
that
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grandcourt
,
the
Vandyke
duchess
,
is
your
cousin
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
;
I
was
her
bridesmaid
,
"
said
Anna
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
mamma
and
mine
are
sisters
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
was
much
richer
before
last
year
,
but
then
she
and
mamma
lost
all
their
fortune
.
<EOS>
Papa
is
a
clergyman
,
you
know
,
so
it
makes
very
little
difference
to
us
,
except
that
we
keep
no
carriage
,
and
have
no
dinner
parties
 
<EOS>
and
I
like
it
better
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
very
sad
for
poor
Aunt
Davilow
,
for
she
could
not
live
with
us
,
because
she
has
four
daughters
besides
Gwendolen
;
but
then
,
when
she
married
Mr.
Grandcourt
,
it
did
not
signify
so
much
,
because
of
his
being
so
rich
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
this
finding
out
relationships
is
delightful
!
"
said
Mab
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
like
a
Chinese
puzzle
that
one
has
to
fit
together
.
<EOS>
I
feel
sure
something
wonderful
may
be
made
of
it
,
but
I
ca
n't
tell
what
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
Mab
,
"
said
Amy
,
"
relationships
must
branch
out
.
<EOS>
The
only
difference
is
,
that
we
happen
to
know
some
of
the
people
concerned
.
<EOS>
Such
things
are
going
on
every
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
pray
,
Amy
,
why
do
you
insist
on
the
number
nine
being
so
wonderful
?
"
said
Mab
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
that
is
happening
every
day
.
<EOS>
Never
mind
,
Miss
Gascoigne
;
please
go
on
.
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Deronda
?
 
<EOS>
have
you
never
seen
Mr.
Deronda
?
<EOS>
You
_
must
_
bring
him
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
have
not
seen
him
,
"
said
Anna
;
"
but
he
was
at
Diplow
before
my
cousin
was
married
,
and
I
have
heard
my
aunt
speaking
of
him
to
papa
.
<EOS>
She
said
what
you
have
been
saying
about
him
 
only
not
so
much
:
I
mean
,
about
Mr.
Deronda
living
with
Sir
Hugo
Mallinger
,
and
being
so
nice
,
she
thought
.
<EOS>
We
talk
a
great
deal
about
every
one
who
comes
near
Pennicote
,
because
it
is
so
seldom
there
is
any
one
new
.
<EOS>
But
I
remember
,
when
I
asked
Gwendolen
what
she
thought
of
Mr.
Deronda
,
she
said
,
"
Do
n't
mention
it
,
Anna
:
but
I
think
his
hair
is
dark
.
<EOS>
"
That
was
her
droll
way
of
answering
:
she
was
always
so
lively
.
<EOS>
It
is
really
rather
wonderful
that
I
should
come
to
hear
so
much
about
him
,
all
through
Mr.
Hans
knowing
Rex
,
and
then
my
having
the
pleasure
of
knowing
you
,
"
Anna
ended
,
looking
at
Mrs.
Meyrick
with
a
shy
grace
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
pleasure
is
on
our
side
too
;
but
the
wonder
would
have
been
,
if
you
had
come
to
this
house
without
hearing
of
Mr.
Deronda
 
<EOS>
would
n't
it
,
Mirah
?
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
.
  
<EOS>
Mirah
smiled
acquiescently
,
but
had
nothing
to
say
.
<EOS>
A
confused
discontent
took
possession
of
her
at
the
mingling
of
names
and
images
to
which
she
had
been
listening
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
son
calls
Mrs.
Grandcourt
the
Vandyke
duchess
,
"
continued
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
turning
again
to
Anna
;
"
he
thinks
her
so
striking
and
picturesque
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Anna
.
<EOS>
"
Gwendolen
was
always
so
beautiful
 
people
fell
dreadfully
in
love
with
her
.
<EOS>
I
thought
it
a
pity
,
because
it
made
them
unhappy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
do
you
like
Mr.
Grandcourt
,
the
happy
lover
?
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
who
,
in
her
way
,
was
as
much
interested
as
Mab
in
the
hints
she
had
been
hearing
of
vicissitude
in
the
life
of
a
widow
with
daughters
.
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
approved
of
Gwendolen
's
accepting
him
,
and
my
aunt
says
he
is
very
generous
,
"
said
Anna
,
beginning
with
a
virtuous
intention
of
repressing
her
own
sentiments
;
but
then
,
unable
to
resist
a
rare
occasion
for
speaking
them
freely
,
she
went
on
 
"
else
<EOS>
I
should
have
thought
he
was
not
very
nice
 
<EOS>
rather
proud
,
and
not
at
all
lively
,
like
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
thought
some
one
younger
and
more
lively
would
have
suited
her
better
.
<EOS>
But
,
perhaps
,
having
a
brother
who
seems
to
us
better
than
any
one
makes
us
think
worse
of
others
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wait
till
you
see
Mr.
Deronda
,
"
said
Mab
,
nodding
significantly
.
<EOS>
"
Nobody
's
brother
will
do
after
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Our
brothers
_
must
_
do
for
people
's
husbands
,
"
said
Kate
,
curtly
,
"
because
they
will
not
get
Mr.
Deronda
.
<EOS>
No
woman
will
do
for
him
to
marry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
woman
ought
to
want
him
to
marry
him
,
"
said
Mab
,
with
indignation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
_
I
_
never
should
.
<EOS>
Fancy
finding
out
that
he
had
a
tailor
's
bill
,
and
used
boot
-
hooks
,
like
Hans
.
<EOS>
Who
ever
thought
of
his
marrying
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
,
"
said
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
drew
a
wedding
for
a
frontispiece
to
"
Hearts
and
Diamonds
,
"
I
made
a
sort
of
likeness
to
him
for
the
bridegroom
,
and
I
went
about
looking
for
a
grand
woman
who
would
do
for
his
countess
,
but
I
saw
none
that
would
not
be
poor
creatures
by
the
side
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
have
seen
this
Mrs.
Grandcourt
then
,
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hans
says
that
she
and
Mr.
Deronda
set
each
other
off
when
they
are
side
by
side
.
<EOS>
She
is
tall
and
fair
.
<EOS>
But
you
know
her
,
Mirah
 
<EOS>
you
can
always
say
something
descriptive
.
<EOS>
What
do
_
<EOS>
you
_
think
of
Mrs.
Grandcourt
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
is
the
_
Princess
of
Eboli
<EOS>
_
in
_
Don
Carlos
_
<EOS>
,
"
said
Mirah
,
with
a
quick
intensity
.
<EOS>
She
was
pursuing
an
association
in
her
own
mind
not
intelligible
to
her
hearers
 
<EOS>
an
association
with
a
certain
actress
as
well
as
the
part
she
represented
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
comparison
is
a
riddle
for
me
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
smiling
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
said
that
Mrs.
Grandcourt
was
tall
and
fair
,
"
continued
Mirah
,
slightly
paler
.
<EOS>
"
That
is
quite
true
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Meyrick
's
quick
eye
and
ear
detected
something
unusual
,
but
immediately
explained
it
to
herself
.
<EOS>
Fine
ladies
had
often
wounded
Mirah
by
caprices
of
manner
and
intention
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Grandcourt
had
thought
of
having
lessons
of
Mirah
,
"
she
said
turning
to
Anna
.
"
<EOS>
But
many
have
talked
of
having
lessons
,
and
then
have
found
no
time
.
<EOS>
Fashionable
ladies
have
too
much
work
to
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
the
chat
went
on
without
further
insistance
on
the
_
Princess
of
Eboli
_
.
<EOS>
That
comparison
escaped
Mirah
's
lips
under
the
urgency
of
a
pang
unlike
anything
she
had
felt
before
.
<EOS>
The
conversation
from
the
beginning
had
revived
unpleasant
impressions
,
and
Mrs.
Meyrick
's
suggestion
of
Gwendolen
's
figure
by
the
side
of
Deronda
's
had
the
stinging
effect
of
a
voice
outside
her
,
confirming
her
secret
conviction
that
this
tall
and
fair
woman
had
some
hold
on
his
lot
.
<EOS>
For
a
long
while
afterward
she
felt
as
if
she
had
had
a
jarring
shock
through
her
frame
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
evening
,
putting
her
cheek
against
her
brother
's
shoulder
as
she
was
sitting
by
him
,
while
he
sat
propped
up
in
bed
under
a
new
difficulty
of
breathing
,
she
said
    
"
Ezra
,
does
it
ever
hurt
your
love
for
Mr.
Deronda
that
so
much
of
his
life
was
all
hidden
away
from
you
 
that
he
is
amongst
persons
and
cares
about
persons
who
are
all
so
unlike
us
 
<EOS>
I
mean
unlike
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
assuredly
no
,
"
said
Mordecai
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Rather
it
is
a
precious
thought
to
me
that
he
has
a
preparation
which
I
lacked
,
and
is
an
accomplished
Egyptian
.
"
<EOS>
Then
,
recollecting
that
his
words
had
reference
which
his
sister
must
not
yet
understand
,
he
added
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
the
more
to
give
him
,
since
his
treasure
differs
from
mine
.
<EOS>
That
is
a
blessedness
in
friendship
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mirah
mused
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
Still
,
"
she
said
,
"
it
would
be
a
trial
to
your
love
for
him
if
that
other
part
of
his
life
were
like
a
crowd
in
which
he
had
got
entangled
,
so
that
he
was
carried
away
from
you
 
<EOS>
I
mean
in
his
thoughts
,
and
not
merely
carried
out
of
sight
as
he
is
now
 
and
not
merely
for
a
little
while
,
but
continually
.
<EOS>
How
should
you
bear
that
!
<EOS>
Our
religion
commands
us
to
bear
.
<EOS>
But
how
should
you
bear
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
well
,
my
sister
 
<EOS>
not
well
;
but
it
will
never
happen
,
"
said
Mordecai
,
looking
at
her
with
a
tender
smile
.
<EOS>
He
thought
that
her
heart
needed
comfort
on
his
account
.
  
<EOS>
Mirah
said
no
more
.
<EOS>
She
mused
over
the
difference
between
her
own
state
of
mind
and
her
brother
's
,
and
felt
her
comparative
pettiness
.
<EOS>
Why
could
she
not
be
completely
satisfied
with
what
satisfied
his
larger
judgment
?
<EOS>
She
gave
herself
no
fuller
reason
than
a
painful
sense
of
unfitness
 
in
what
?
<EOS>
Airy
possibilities
to
which
she
could
give
no
outline
,
but
to
which
one
name
and
one
figure
gave
the
wandering
persistency
of
a
blot
in
her
vision
.
<EOS>
Here
lay
the
vaguer
source
of
the
hidden
sadness
rendered
noticeable
to
Hans
by
some
diminution
of
that
sweet
ease
,
that
ready
joyousness
of
response
in
her
speech
and
smile
,
which
had
come
with
the
new
sense
of
freedom
and
safety
,
and
had
made
her
presence
like
the
freshly
-
opened
daisies
and
clear
bird
-
notes
after
the
rain
.
<EOS>
She
herself
regarded
her
uneasiness
as
a
sort
of
ingratitude
and
dullness
of
sensibility
toward
the
great
things
that
had
been
given
her
in
her
new
life
;
and
whenever
she
threw
more
energy
than
usual
into
her
singing
,
it
was
the
energy
of
indignation
against
the
shallowness
of
her
own
content
.
<EOS>
In
that
mood
she
once
said
,
"
Shall
I
tell
you
what
is
the
difference
between
you
and
me
,
Ezra
?
<EOS>
You
are
a
spring
in
the
drought
,
and
I
am
an
acorn
-
cup
;
the
waters
of
heaven
fill
me
,
but
the
least
little
shake
leaves
me
empty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
has
shaken
thee
?
"
said
Mordecai
.
<EOS>
He
fell
into
this
antique
form
of
speech
habitually
in
talking
to
his
sister
and
to
the
Cohen
children
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thoughts
,
"
said
Mirah
;
"
thoughts
that
come
like
the
breeze
and
shake
me
 
bad
people
,
wrong
things
,
misery
 
and
how
they
might
touch
our
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
take
our
portion
,
Mirah
.
<EOS>
It
is
there
.
<EOS>
On
whose
shoulder
would
we
lay
it
,
that
we
might
be
free
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
one
voluntary
sign
she
made
of
her
inward
care
was
this
distant
allusion
.
      
<EOS>
"
My
desolation
does
begin
to
make
  
A
better
life
.

Before
Deronda
was
summoned
to
a
second
interview
with
his
mother
,
a
day
had
passed
in
which
she
had
only
sent
him
a
message
to
say
that
she
was
not
yet
well
enough
to
receive
him
again
;
but
on
the
third
morning
he
had
a
note
saying
,
"
I
leave
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Come
and
see
me
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
shown
into
the
same
room
as
before
;
but
it
was
much
darkened
with
blinds
and
curtains
.
<EOS>
The
Princess
was
not
there
,
but
she
presently
entered
,
dressed
in
a
loose
wrap
of
some
soft
silk
,
in
color
a
dusky
orange
,
her
head
again
with
black
lace
floating
about
it
,
her
arms
showing
themselves
bare
from
under
her
wide
sleeves
.
<EOS>
Her
face
seemed
even
more
impressive
in
the
sombre
light
,
<EOS>
the
eyes
larger
,
the
lines
more
vigorous
.
<EOS>
You
might
have
imagined
her
a
sorceress
who
would
stretch
forth
her
wonderful
hand
and
arm
to
mix
youth
-
potions
for
others
,
but
scorned
to
mix
them
for
herself
,
having
had
enough
of
youth
.
  
<EOS>
She
put
her
arms
on
her
son
's
shoulders
at
once
,
and
kissed
him
on
both
cheeks
,
then
seated
herself
among
her
cushions
with
an
air
of
assured
firmness
and
dignity
unlike
her
fitfulness
in
their
first
interview
,
and
told
Deronda
to
sit
down
by
her
.
<EOS>
He
obeyed
,
saying
,
"
You
are
quite
relieved
now
,
I
trust
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
am
at
ease
again
.
<EOS>
Is
there
anything
more
that
you
would
like
to
ask
me
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
with
the
matter
of
a
queen
rather
than
of
a
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
I
find
the
house
in
Genoa
where
you
used
to
live
with
my
grandfather
?
"
said
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
she
answered
,
with
a
deprecating
movement
of
her
arm
,
"
it
is
pulled
down
 
not
to
be
found
.
<EOS>
But
about
our
family
,
and
where
my
father
lived
at
various
times
 
you
will
find
all
that
among
the
papers
in
the
chest
,
better
than
I
can
tell
you
.
<EOS>
My
father
,
I
told
you
,
was
a
physician
.
<EOS>
My
mother
was
a
Morteira
.
<EOS>
I
used
to
hear
all
those
things
without
listening
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
them
all
.
<EOS>
I
was
born
amongst
them
without
my
will
.
<EOS>
I
banished
them
as
soon
as
I
could
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
tried
to
hide
his
pained
feeling
,
and
said
,
"
Anything
else
that
I
should
desire
to
know
from
you
could
only
be
what
it
is
some
satisfaction
to
your
own
feeling
to
tell
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
have
told
you
everything
that
could
be
demanded
of
me
,
"
said
the
Princess
,
looking
coldly
meditative
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
if
she
had
exhausted
her
emotion
in
their
former
interview
.
<EOS>
The
fact
was
,
she
had
said
to
herself
,
"
I
have
done
it
all
.
<EOS>
I
have
confessed
all
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
go
through
it
again
.
<EOS>
I
will
save
myself
from
agitation
.
"
<EOS>
And
she
was
acting
out
that
scheme
.
  
<EOS>
But
to
Deronda
's
nature
the
moment
was
cruel
;
it
made
the
filial
yearning
of
his
life
a
disappointed
pilgrimage
to
a
shrine
where
there
were
no
longer
the
symbols
of
sacredness
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
that
all
the
woman
lacking
in
her
was
present
in
him
,
as
he
said
,
with
some
tremor
in
his
voice
    
"
Then
are
we
to
part
<EOS>
and
I
never
be
anything
to
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
better
so
,
"
said
the
Princess
,
in
a
softer
,
mellower
voice
.
<EOS>
"
There
could
be
nothing
but
hard
duty
for
you
,
even
if
it
were
possible
for
you
to
take
the
place
of
my
son
.
<EOS>
You
would
not
love
me
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
deny
it
,
"
she
said
,
abruptly
,
putting
up
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
is
the
truth
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
like
what
I
did
.
<EOS>
You
are
angry
with
me
.
<EOS>
You
think
I
robbed
you
of
something
.
<EOS>
You
are
on
your
grandfather
's
side
,
and
you
will
always
have
a
condemnation
of
me
in
your
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
felt
himself
under
a
ban
of
silence
.
<EOS>
He
rose
from
his
seat
by
her
,
preferring
to
stand
,
if
he
had
to
obey
that
imperious
prohibition
of
any
tenderness
.
<EOS>
But
his
mother
now
looked
up
at
him
with
a
new
admiration
in
her
glance
,
saying
    
"
You
are
wrong
to
be
angry
with
me
.
<EOS>
You
are
the
better
for
what
I
did
.
"
<EOS>
After
pausing
a
little
,
she
added
,
abruptly
,
"
And
now
tell
me
what
you
shall
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
now
,
immediately
,
"
said
Deronda
;
"
or
as
to
the
course
of
my
future
life
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
in
the
future
.
<EOS>
What
difference
will
it
make
to
you
that
I
have
told
you
about
your
birth
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
very
great
difference
,
"
said
Deronda
,
emphatically
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
hardly
think
of
anything
that
would
make
a
greater
difference
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
shall
you
do
then
?
"
said
the
Princess
,
with
more
sharpness
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Make
yourself
just
like
your
grandfather
 
be
what
he
wished
you
 
turn
yourself
into
a
Jew
like
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
impossible
.
<EOS>
The
effect
of
my
education
can
never
be
done
away
with
.
<EOS>
The
Christian
sympathies
in
which
my
mind
was
reared
can
never
die
out
of
me
,
"
said
Deronda
,
with
increasing
tenacity
of
tone
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
consider
it
my
duty
 
<EOS>
it
is
the
impulse
of
my
feeling
 
to
identify
myself
,
as
far
as
possible
,
with
my
hereditary
people
,
and
if
I
can
see
any
work
to
be
done
for
them
that
I
can
give
my
soul
and
hand
to
<EOS>
I
shall
choose
to
do
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
mother
had
her
eyes
fixed
on
him
with
a
wondering
speculation
,
examining
his
face
as
if
she
thought
that
by
close
attention
she
could
read
a
difficult
language
there
.
<EOS>
He
bore
her
gaze
very
firmly
,
sustained
by
a
resolute
opposition
,
which
was
the
expression
of
his
fullest
self
.
<EOS>
She
bent
toward
him
a
little
,
and
said
,
with
a
decisive
emphasis
    
<EOS>
"
You
are
in
love
with
a
Jewess
.
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
colored
and
said
,
"
My
reasons
would
be
independent
of
any
such
fact
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
better
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
what
men
are
,
"
said
the
Princess
,
peremptorily
.
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
the
truth
.
<EOS>
She
is
a
Jewess
who
will
not
accept
any
one
but
a
Jew
.
<EOS>
There
_
are
_
<EOS>
a
few
such
,
"
she
added
,
with
a
touch
of
scorn
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
had
that
objection
to
answer
which
we
all
have
known
in
speaking
to
those
who
are
too
certain
of
their
own
fixed
interpretations
to
be
enlightened
by
anything
we
may
say
.
<EOS>
But
besides
this
,
the
point
immediately
in
question
was
one
on
which
he
felt
a
repugnance
either
to
deny
or
affirm
.
<EOS>
He
remained
silent
,
and
she
presently
said
    
"
You
love
her
as
your
father
loved
me
,
and
she
draws
you
after
her
as
I
drew
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Those
words
touched
Deronda
's
filial
imagination
,
and
some
tenderness
in
his
glance
was
taken
by
his
mother
as
an
assent
.
<EOS>
She
went
on
with
rising
passion
:
"
But
I
was
leading
him
the
other
way
.
<EOS>
And
now
your
grandfather
is
getting
his
revenge
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
"
said
Deronda
,
remonstrantly
,
"
do
n't
let
us
think
of
it
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
I
will
admit
that
there
may
come
some
benefit
from
the
education
you
chose
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
prefer
cherishing
the
benefit
with
gratitude
,
to
dwelling
with
resentment
on
the
injury
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
would
have
been
right
that
I
should
have
been
brought
up
with
the
consciousness
that
I
was
a
Jew
,
but
it
must
always
have
been
a
good
to
me
to
have
as
wide
an
instruction
and
sympathy
as
possible
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
you
have
restored
me
my
inheritance
 
<EOS>
events
have
brought
a
fuller
restitution
than
you
could
have
made
 
you
have
been
saved
from
robbing
my
people
of
my
service
and
me
of
my
duty
:
can
you
not
bring
your
whole
soul
to
consent
to
this
?
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
paused
in
his
pleading
:
his
mother
looked
at
him
listeningly
,
as
if
the
cadence
of
his
voice
were
taking
her
ear
,
yet
she
shook
her
head
slowly
.
<EOS>
He
began
again
,
even
more
urgently
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
told
me
that
you
sought
what
you
held
the
best
for
me
:
open
your
heart
to
relenting
and
love
toward
my
grandfather
,
who
sought
what
he
held
the
best
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
for
me
,
no
<EOS>
,
"
she
said
,
shaking
her
head
with
more
absolute
denial
,
and
folding
her
arms
tightly
.
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
he
never
thought
of
his
daughter
except
as
an
instrument
.
<EOS>
Because
I
had
wants
outside
his
purpose
,
I
was
to
be
put
in
a
frame
and
tortured
.
<EOS>
If
that
is
the
right
law
for
the
world
,
I
will
not
say
that
I
love
it
.
<EOS>
If
my
acts
were
wrong
 
if
it
is
God
who
is
exacting
from
me
that
I
should
deliver
up
what
I
withheld
 
who
is
punishing
me
because
I
deceived
my
father
and
did
not
warn
him
that
I
should
contradict
his
trust
 
<EOS>
well
,
I
have
told
everything
.
<EOS>
I
have
done
what
I
could
.
<EOS>
And
_
your
_
soul
consents
.
<EOS>
That
is
enough
.
<EOS>
I
have
after
all
been
the
instrument
my
father
wanted
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
desire
a
grandson
who
shall
have
a
true
Jewish
heart
.
<EOS>
Every
Jew
should
rear
his
family
as
if
he
hoped
that
a
Deliverer
might
spring
from
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
In
uttering
these
last
sentences
the
Princess
narrowed
her
eyes
,
waved
her
head
up
and
down
,
and
spoke
slowly
with
a
new
kind
of
chest
-
voice
,
as
if
she
were
quoting
unwillingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Were
those
my
grandfather
's
words
?
"
said
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
;
and
you
will
find
them
written
.
<EOS>
I
wanted
to
thwart
him
,
"
said
the
Princess
,
with
a
sudden
outburst
of
the
passion
she
had
shown
in
the
former
interview
.
<EOS>
Then
she
added
more
slowly
,
"
You
would
have
me
love
what
I
have
hated
from
the
time
I
was
so
high
<EOS>
"
 
here
she
held
her
left
hand
a
yard
from
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
can
never
be
.
<EOS>
But
what
does
it
matter
?
<EOS>
His
yoke
has
been
on
me
,
whether
I
loved
it
or
not
.
<EOS>
You
are
the
grandson
he
wanted
.
<EOS>
You
speak
as
men
do
 
as
if
you
felt
yourself
wise
.
<EOS>
What
does
it
all
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
tone
was
abrupt
and
scornful
.
<EOS>
Deronda
,
in
his
pained
feeling
,
and
under
the
solemn
urgency
of
the
moment
,
had
to
keep
a
clutching
remembrance
of
their
relationship
,
lest
his
words
should
become
cruel
.
<EOS>
He
began
in
a
deep
entreating
tone
:
  
"
<EOS>
Mother
,
do
n't
say
that
I
feel
myself
wise
.
<EOS>
We
are
set
in
the
midst
of
difficulties
.
<EOS>
I
see
no
other
way
to
get
any
clearness
than
by
being
truthful
 
not
by
keeping
back
facts
which
may
 
which
should
carry
obligation
within
them
 
which
should
make
the
only
guidance
toward
duty
.
<EOS>
No
wonder
if
such
facts
come
to
reveal
themselves
in
spite
of
concealments
.
<EOS>
The
effects
prepared
by
generations
are
likely
to
triumph
over
a
contrivance
which
would
bend
them
all
to
the
satisfaction
of
self
.
<EOS>
Your
will
was
strong
,
but
my
grandfather
's
trust
which
you
accepted
and
did
not
fulfill
 
what
you
call
his
yoke
 
is
the
expression
of
something
stronger
,
with
deeper
,
farther
-
spreading
roots
,
knit
into
the
foundations
of
sacredness
for
all
men
.
<EOS>
You
renounced
me
 
you
still
banish
me
 
as
a
son
"
 
<EOS>
there
was
an
involuntary
movement
of
indignation
in
Deronda
's
voice
 
"
But
that
stronger
Something
has
determined
that
I
shall
be
all
the
more
the
grandson
whom
also
you
willed
to
annihilate
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
mother
was
watching
him
fixedly
,
and
again
her
face
gathered
admiration
.
<EOS>
After
a
moment
's
silence
she
said
,
in
a
low
,
persuasive
tone
    
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
again
,
"
and
he
obeyed
,
placing
himself
beside
her
.
<EOS>
She
laid
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
went
on
    
<EOS>
"
You
rebuke
me
.
<EOS>
Well
 
I
am
the
loser
.
<EOS>
And
you
are
angry
because
I
banish
you
.
<EOS>
What
could
you
do
for
me
but
weary
your
own
patience
?
<EOS>
Your
mother
is
a
shattered
woman
.
<EOS>
My
sense
of
life
is
little
more
than
a
sense
of
what
was
 
except
when
the
pain
is
present
.
<EOS>
You
reproach
me
that
I
parted
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
had
joy
enough
without
you
then
.
<EOS>
Now
you
are
come
back
to
me
,
and
I
can
not
make
you
a
joy
.
<EOS>
Have
you
the
cursing
spirit
of
the
Jew
in
you
?
<EOS>
Are
you
not
able
to
forgive
me
?
<EOS>
Shall
you
be
glad
to
think
that
I
am
punished
because
I
was
not
a
Jewish
mother
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
ask
me
that
?
"
said
Deronda
,
remonstrantly
.
"
<EOS>
Have
I
not
besought
you
that
I
might
now
at
least
be
a
son
to
you
?
<EOS>
My
grief
is
that
you
have
declared
me
helpless
to
comfort
you
.
<EOS>
I
would
give
up
much
that
is
dear
for
the
sake
of
soothing
your
anguish
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
give
up
nothing
,
"
said
his
mother
,
with
the
hurry
of
agitation
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
be
happy
.
<EOS>
You
shall
let
me
think
of
you
as
happy
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
done
you
no
harm
.
<EOS>
You
have
no
reason
to
curse
me
.
<EOS>
You
shall
feel
for
me
as
they
feel
for
the
dead
whom
they
say
prayers
for
 
you
shall
long
that
I
may
be
freed
from
all
suffering
 
from
all
punishment
.
<EOS>
And
I
shall
see
you
instead
of
always
seeing
your
grandfather
.
<EOS>
Will
any
harm
come
to
me
because
I
broke
his
trust
in
the
daylight
after
he
was
gone
into
darkness
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
:
 
if
you
think
_
Kaddish
_
will
help
me
 
say
it
,
say
it
.
<EOS>
You
will
come
between
me
and
the
dead
.
<EOS>
When
I
am
in
your
mind
,
you
will
look
as
you
do
now
 
always
as
if
you
were
a
tender
son
 
always
 
as
if
I
had
been
a
tender
mother
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
seemed
resolved
that
her
agitation
should
not
conquer
her
,
but
he
felt
her
hand
trembling
on
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
Deep
,
deep
compassion
hemmed
in
all
words
.
<EOS>
With
a
face
of
beseeching
he
put
his
arm
around
her
and
pressed
her
head
tenderly
under
his
.
<EOS>
They
sat
so
for
some
moments
.
<EOS>
Then
she
lifted
her
head
again
and
rose
from
her
seat
with
a
great
sigh
,
as
if
in
that
breath
she
were
dismissing
a
weight
of
thoughts
.
<EOS>
Deronda
,
standing
in
front
of
her
,
felt
that
the
parting
was
near
.
<EOS>
But
one
of
her
swift
alternations
had
come
upon
his
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
she
beautiful
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
abruptly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
?
"
said
Deronda
,
changing
color
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
woman
you
love
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
a
moment
for
deliberate
explanation
.
<EOS>
He
was
obliged
to
say
,
"
Yes
.
"
  
"
Not
ambitious
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
think
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
one
who
must
have
a
path
of
her
own
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
her
nature
is
not
given
to
make
great
claims
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
not
like
that
?
"
said
the
Princess
,
taking
from
her
wallet
a
miniature
with
jewels
around
it
,
and
holding
it
before
her
son
.
<EOS>
It
was
her
own
in
all
the
fire
of
youth
,
and
as
Deronda
looked
at
it
with
admiring
sadness
,
she
said
,
"
<EOS>
Had
I
not
a
rightful
claim
to
be
something
more
than
a
mere
daughter
and
mother
?
<EOS>
The
voice
and
the
genius
matched
the
face
.
<EOS>
Whatever
else
was
wrong
,
acknowledge
that
I
had
a
right
to
be
an
artist
,
though
my
father
's
will
was
against
it
.
<EOS>
My
nature
gave
me
a
charter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
acknowledge
that
,
"
said
Deronda
,
looking
from
the
miniature
to
her
face
,
which
even
in
its
worn
pallor
had
an
expression
of
living
force
beyond
anything
that
the
pencil
could
show
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
take
the
portrait
?
"
said
the
Princess
,
more
gently
.
<EOS>
"
If
she
is
a
kind
woman
,
teach
her
to
think
of
me
kindly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
grateful
for
the
portrait
,
"
said
Deronda
,
"
<EOS>
but
 
I
ought
to
say
<EOS>
,
I
have
no
assurance
that
she
whom
I
love
will
have
any
love
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
kept
silence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
and
what
is
she
?
"
said
the
mother
.
<EOS>
The
question
seemed
a
command
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
was
brought
up
as
a
singer
for
the
stage
,
"
said
Deronda
,
with
inward
reluctance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
father
took
her
away
early
from
her
mother
,
and
her
life
has
been
unhappy
.
<EOS>
She
is
very
young
 
only
twenty
.
<EOS>
Her
father
wished
to
bring
her
up
in
disregard
 
even
in
dislike
of
her
Jewish
origin
,
but
she
has
clung
with
all
her
affection
to
the
memory
of
her
mother
and
the
fellowship
of
her
people
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
like
you
.
<EOS>
She
is
attached
to
the
Judaism
<EOS>
she
knows
nothing
of
,
"
said
the
Princess
,
peremptorily
.
<EOS>
"
That
is
poetry
 
fit
to
last
through
an
opera
night
.
<EOS>
Is
she
fond
of
her
artist
's
life
 
<EOS>
is
her
singing
worth
anything
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Her
singing
is
exquisite
.
<EOS>
But
her
voice
is
not
suited
to
the
stage
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
the
artist
's
life
has
been
made
repugnant
to
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
she
is
made
for
you
then
.
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
said
you
were
bitterly
against
being
a
singer
,
and
I
can
see
that
you
would
never
have
let
yourself
be
merged
in
a
wife
,
as
your
father
was
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
repeat
,
"
said
Deronda
,
<EOS>
emphatically
 
"
I
repeat
that
I
have
no
assurance
of
her
love
for
me
,
of
the
possibility
that
we
can
ever
be
united
.
<EOS>
Other
things
 
<EOS>
painful
issues
may
lie
before
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
felt
that
I
should
prepare
myself
to
renounce
,
not
cherish
that
prospect
.
<EOS>
But
I
suppose
I
might
feel
so
of
happiness
in
general
.
<EOS>
Whether
it
may
come
or
not
,
one
should
try
and
prepare
one
's
self
to
do
without
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
feel
in
that
way
?
"
said
his
mother
,
laying
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
,
and
perusing
his
face
,
while
she
spoke
in
a
low
meditative
tone
,
pausing
between
her
sentences
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Poor
boy
!
   
<EOS>
I
wonder
how
it
would
have
been
if
I
had
kept
you
with
me
   
whether
you
would
have
turned
your
heart
to
the
old
things
against
mine
   
<EOS>
and
we
should
have
quarreled
   
<EOS>
your
grandfather
would
have
been
in
you
   
and
you
would
have
hampered
my
life
with
your
young
growth
from
the
old
root
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
my
affection
might
have
lasted
through
all
our
quarreling
,
"
said
Deronda
,
saddened
more
and
more
,
"
and
that
would
not
have
hampered
 
surely
it
would
have
enriched
your
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
then
,
not
then
   
I
did
not
want
it
then
   
<EOS>
I
might
have
been
glad
of
it
now
,
"
said
the
mother
,
with
a
bitter
melancholy
,
"
if
I
could
have
been
glad
of
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
love
your
other
children
,
and
they
love
you
?
"
<EOS>
said
Deronda
,
anxiously
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
"
she
answered
,
as
to
a
question
about
a
matter
of
course
,
while
she
folded
her
arms
again
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
"
   
she
added
in
a
deeper
tone
,
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
a
loving
woman
.
<EOS>
That
is
the
truth
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
talent
to
love
 
<EOS>
I
lack
it
.
<EOS>
Others
have
loved
me
 
and
I
have
acted
their
love
.
<EOS>
I
know
very
well
what
love
makes
of
men
and
women
 
<EOS>
it
is
subjection
.
<EOS>
It
takes
another
for
a
larger
self
,
enclosing
this
one
,
"
 
she
pointed
to
her
own
bosom
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
never
willingly
subject
to
any
man
.
<EOS>
Men
have
been
subject
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
the
man
who
was
subject
was
the
happier
of
the
two
,
"
said
Deronda
 
not
with
a
smile
,
but
with
a
grave
,
sad
sense
of
his
mother
's
privation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
 
but
I
_
was
_
happy
 
for
a
few
years
<EOS>
I
was
happy
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
not
been
afraid
of
defeat
and
failure
,
I
might
have
gone
on
.
<EOS>
I
miscalculated
.
<EOS>
What
then
?
<EOS>
It
is
all
over
.
<EOS>
Another
life
!
<EOS>
Men
talk
of
"
another
life
,
"
as
if
it
only
began
on
the
other
side
of
the
grave
.
<EOS>
I
have
long
entered
on
another
life
.
<EOS>
"
With
the
last
words
she
raised
her
arms
till
they
were
bare
to
the
elbow
,
her
brow
was
contracted
in
one
deep
fold
,
her
eyes
were
closed
,
her
voice
was
smothered
:
in
her
dusky
flame
-
colored
garment
,
she
looked
like
a
dreamed
visitant
from
some
region
of
departed
mortals
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
's
feeling
was
wrought
to
a
pitch
of
acuteness
in
which
he
was
no
longer
quite
master
of
himself
.
<EOS>
He
gave
an
audible
sob
.
<EOS>
His
mother
,
opened
her
eyes
,
and
letting
her
hands
again
rest
on
his
shoulders
,
said
    
"
Good
-
bye
,
my
son
,
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
We
shall
hear
no
more
of
each
other
.
<EOS>
Kiss
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
clasped
his
arms
round
her
neck
,
and
they
kissed
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
did
not
know
how
he
got
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
felt
an
older
man
.
<EOS>
All
his
boyish
yearnings
and
anxieties
about
his
mother
had
vanished
.
<EOS>
He
had
gone
through
a
tragic
experience
which
must
forever
solemnize
his
life
and
deepen
the
significance
of
the
acts
by
which
he
bound
himself
to
others
.
            
<EOS>
"
The
unwilling
brain
  
Feigns
<EOS>
often
what
it
would
not
;
and
we
trust
  
Imagination
with
such
phantasies
  
<EOS>
As
the
tongue
dares
not
fashion
into
words
;
  
Which
have
no
words
,
their
horror
makes
them
dim
  
<EOS>
To
the
mind

SHELLEY
.
   
<EOS>
Madonna
Pia
,
whose
husband
,
feeling
himself
injured
by
her
,
took
her
to
his
castle
amid
the
swampy
flats
of
the
Maremma
and
got
rid
of
her
there
,
makes
a
pathetic
figure
in
Dante
's
Purgatory
,
among
the
sinners
who
repented
at
the
last
and
desire
to
be
remembered
compassionately
by
their
fellow
-
countrymen
.
<EOS>
We
know
little
about
the
grounds
of
mutual
discontent
between
the
Siennese
couple
,
but
we
may
infer
with
some
confidence
that
the
husband
had
never
been
a
very
delightful
companion
,
and
that
on
the
flats
of
the
Maremma
his
disagreeable
manners
had
a
background
which
threw
them
out
remarkably
;
whence
in
his
desire
to
punish
his
wife
to
the
unmost
,
<EOS>
the
nature
of
things
was
so
far
against
him
that
in
relieving
himself
of
her
<EOS>
he
could
not
avoid
making
the
relief
mutual
.
<EOS>
And
thus
,
without
any
hardness
to
the
poor
Tuscan
lady
,
who
had
her
deliverance
long
ago
,
one
may
feel
warranted
in
thinking
of
her
with
a
less
sympathetic
interest
than
of
the
better
known
Gwendolen
who
,
instead
of
being
delivered
from
her
errors
on
earth
and
cleansed
from
their
effect
in
purgatory
,
is
at
the
very
height
of
her
entanglement
in
those
fatal
meshes
which
are
woven
within
more
closely
than
without
,
and
often
make
the
inward
torture
disproportionate
to
what
is
discernable
as
outward
cause
.
  
<EOS>
In
taking
his
wife
with
him
on
a
yachting
expedition
,
Grandcourt
had
no
intention
to
get
rid
of
her
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
wanted
to
feel
more
securely
that
she
was
his
to
do
as
he
liked
with
,
and
to
make
her
feel
it
also
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
he
was
himself
very
fond
of
yachting
:
<EOS>
its
dreamy
do
-
nothing
absolutism
,
unmolested
by
social
demands
,
suited
his
disposition
,
and
he
did
not
in
the
least
regard
it
as
an
equivalent
for
the
dreariness
of
the
Maremma
.
<EOS>
He
had
his
reasons
for
carrying
Gwendolen
out
of
reach
,
but
they
were
not
reasons
that
can
seem
black
in
the
mere
statement
.
<EOS>
He
suspected
a
growing
spirit
of
opposition
in
her
,
and
his
feeling
about
the
sentimental
inclination
she
betrayed
for
Deronda
was
what
in
another
man
he
would
have
called
jealousy
.
<EOS>
In
himself
it
seemed
merely
a
resolution
to
put
an
end
to
such
foolery
as
must
have
been
going
on
in
that
prearranged
visit
of
Deronda
's
which
he
had
divined
and
interrupted
.
  
<EOS>
And
Grandcourt
might
have
pleaded
that
he
was
perfectly
justified
in
taking
care
that
his
wife
should
fulfill
the
obligations
she
had
accepted
.
<EOS>
Her
marriage
was
a
contract
where
all
the
ostensible
advantages
were
on
her
side
,
and
it
was
only
of
those
advantages
that
her
husband
should
use
his
power
to
hinder
her
from
any
injurious
self
committal
or
unsuitable
behavior
.
<EOS>
He
knew
quite
well
that
she
had
not
married
him
 
had
not
overcome
her
repugnance
to
certain
facts
 
out
of
love
to
him
personally
;
he
had
won
her
by
the
rank
and
luxuries
he
had
to
give
her
,
and
<EOS>
these
she
had
got
:
he
had
fulfilled
his
side
of
the
contract
.
  
<EOS>
And
Gwendolen
,
we
know
,
was
thoroughly
aware
of
the
situation
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
excuse
herself
by
saying
that
there
had
been
a
tacit
part
of
the
contract
on
her
side
 
namely
,
that
she
meant
to
rule
and
have
her
own
way
.
<EOS>
With
all
her
early
indulgence
in
the
disposition
to
dominate
,
she
was
not
one
of
the
narrow
-
brained
women
who
through
life
regard
all
their
own
selfish
demands
as
rights
,
and
every
claim
upon
themselves
as
an
injury
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
root
of
conscience
in
her
,
and
the
process
of
purgatory
had
begun
for
her
on
the
green
earth
:
she
knew
that
she
had
been
wrong
.
  
<EOS>
But
now
enter
into
the
soul
of
this
young
creature
as
she
found
herself
,
with
the
blue
Mediterranean
dividing
her
from
the
world
,
on
the
tiny
plank
-
island
of
a
yacht
,
the
domain
of
the
husband
to
whom
she
felt
that
she
had
sold
herself
,
and
had
been
paid
the
strict
price
 
nay
,
paid
more
than
she
had
dared
to
ask
in
the
handsome
maintenance
of
her
mother
:
 
the
husband
to
whom
she
had
sold
her
truthfulness
and
sense
of
justice
,
so
that
he
held
them
throttled
into
silence
,
collared
and
dragged
behind
him
to
witness
what
he
would
,
without
remonstrance
.
  
<EOS>
What
had
she
to
complain
of
?
<EOS>
The
yacht
was
of
the
prettiest
;
the
cabin
fitted
up
to
perfection
,
smelling
of
cedar
,
soft
-
cushioned
,
hung
with
silk
,
expanded
with
mirrors
;
the
crew
such
as
suited
an
elegant
toy
,
one
of
them
having
even
ringlets
,
as
well
as
a
bronze
complexion
and
fine
teeth
;
and
Mr.
Lush
was
not
there
,
for
he
had
taken
his
way
back
to
England
as
soon
as
he
had
seen
all
and
everything
on
board
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
Gwendolen
herself
liked
the
sea
:
it
did
not
make
her
ill
;
and
to
observe
the
rigging
of
the
vessel
and
forecast
the
necessary
adjustments
was
a
sort
of
amusement
that
might
have
gratified
her
activity
and
enjoyment
of
imaginary
rule
;
the
weather
was
fine
,
and
they
were
coasting
southward
,
where
even
the
rain
-
furrowed
,
heat
-
cracked
clay
becomes
gem
-
like
with
purple
shadows
,
and
where
one
may
float
between
blue
and
blue
in
an
open
-
eyed
dream
that
the
world
has
done
with
sorrow
.
  
<EOS>
But
what
can
still
that
hunger
of
the
heart
which
sickens
the
eye
for
beauty
,
and
makes
sweet
-
scented
ease
an
oppression
?
<EOS>
What
sort
of
Moslem
paradise
would
quiet
the
terrible
fury
of
moral
repulsion
and
cowed
resistance
which
,
like
an
eating
pain
intensifying
into
torture
,
concentrates
the
mind
in
that
poisonous
misery
?
<EOS>
While
Gwendolen
,
throned
on
her
cushions
at
evening
,
and
beholding
the
glory
of
sea
and
sky
softening
as
if
with
boundless
love
around
her
,
was
hoping
that
Grandcourt
in
his
march
up
and
down
was
not
going
to
pause
near
her
,
not
going
to
look
at
her
or
speak
to
her
,
<EOS>
some
woman
,
under
a
smoky
sky
,
obliged
to
consider
the
price
of
eggs
in
arranging
her
dinner
,
was
listening
for
the
music
of
a
footstep
that
would
remove
all
risk
from
her
foretaste
of
joy
;
some
couple
,
bending
cheek
by
cheek
,
over
a
bit
of
work
done
by
the
one
and
delighted
in
by
the
other
,
were
reckoning
the
earnings
that
would
make
them
rich
enough
for
a
holiday
among
the
furze
and
heather
.
  
<EOS>
Had
Grandcourt
the
least
conception
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
breast
of
his
wife
?
<EOS>
He
conceived
that
she
did
not
love
him
;
but
was
that
necessary
?
<EOS>
She
was
under
his
power
,
and
he
was
not
accustomed
to
soothe
himself
,
as
some
cheerfully
-
disposed
persons
are
,
with
the
conviction
that
he
was
very
generally
and
justly
beloved
.
<EOS>
But
what
lay
quite
away
from
his
conception
was
,
that
she
could
have
any
special
repulsion
for
him
personally
.
<EOS>
How
could
she
?
<EOS>
He
himself
knew
what
personal
repulsion
was
 
nobody
better
;
his
mind
was
much
furnished
with
a
sense
of
what
brutes
his
fellow
-
creatures
were
,
both
masculine
and
feminine
;
what
odious
familiarities
they
had
,
what
smirks
,
what
modes
of
flourishing
their
handkerchiefs
,
what
costume
,
what
lavender
water
,
<EOS>
what
bulging
eyes
,
and
what
foolish
notions
of
making
themselves
agreeable
by
remarks
which
were
not
wanted
.
<EOS>
In
this
critical
view
of
mankind
there
was
an
affinity
between
him
and
Gwendolen
before
their
marriage
,
and
we
know
that
she
had
been
attractingly
wrought
upon
by
the
refined
negations
he
presented
to
her
.
<EOS>
Hence
he
understood
her
repulsion
for
Lush
.
<EOS>
But
how
was
he
to
understand
or
conceive
her
present
repulsion
for
Henleigh
Grandcourt
?
<EOS>
Some
men
bring
themselves
to
believe
,
and
not
merely
maintain
,
the
non
-
existence
of
an
external
world
;
a
few
others
believe
themselves
objects
of
repulsion
to
a
woman
without
being
told
so
in
plain
language
.
<EOS>
But
Grandcourt
did
not
belong
to
this
eccentric
body
of
thinkers
.
<EOS>
He
had
all
his
life
had
reason
to
take
a
flattering
view
of
his
own
attractiveness
,
and
to
place
himself
in
fine
antithesis
to
the
men
who
,
he
saw
at
once
,
must
be
revolting
to
a
woman
of
taste
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
idea
of
moral
repulsion
,
and
could
not
have
believed
,
if
he
had
been
told
it
,
that
there
may
be
a
resentment
and
disgust
which
will
gradually
make
beauty
more
detestable
than
ugliness
,
through
exasperation
at
that
outward
virtue
in
which
hateful
things
can
flaunt
themselves
or
find
a
supercilious
advantage
.
  
<EOS>
How
,
then
,
could
Grandcourt
divine
what
was
going
on
in
Gwendolen
's
breast
?
  
<EOS>
For
their
behavior
to
each
other
scandalized
no
observer
 
<EOS>
not
even
the
foreign
maid
,
warranted
against
sea
-
sickness
;
nor
Grandcourt
's
own
experienced
valet
:
still
less
the
picturesque
crew
,
who
regarded
them
as
a
model
couple
in
high
life
.
<EOS>
Their
companionship
consisted
chiefly
in
a
well
-
bred
silence
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
had
no
humorous
observations
at
which
Gwendolen
could
refuse
to
smile
,
no
chit
-
chat
to
make
small
occasions
of
dispute
.
<EOS>
He
was
perfectly
polite
in
arranging
an
additional
garment
over
her
when
needful
,
and
in
handing
her
any
object
that
he
perceived
her
to
need
,
and
she
could
not
fall
into
the
vulgarity
of
accepting
or
rejecting
such
politeness
rudely
.
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
put
up
his
telescope
and
said
,
"
There
's
a
plantation
of
sugar
-
canes
at
the
foot
of
that
rock
;
should
you
like
to
look
?
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
said
,
"
Yes
,
please
,
"
remembering
that
she
must
try
and
interest
herself
in
sugar
-
canes
as
something
outside
her
personal
affairs
.
<EOS>
Then
Grandcourt
would
walk
up
and
down
and
smoke
for
a
long
while
,
pausing
occasionally
to
point
out
a
sail
on
the
horizon
,
and
at
last
would
seat
himself
and
look
at
Gwendolen
with
his
narrow
immovable
gaze
,
as
if
she
were
part
of
the
complete
yacht
;
while
she
,
conscious
of
being
looked
at
was
exerting
her
ingenuity
not
to
meet
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
At
dinner
he
would
remark
that
the
fruit
was
getting
stale
,
and
they
must
put
in
somewhere
for
more
;
or
,
observing
that
she
did
not
drink
the
wine
,
he
asked
her
if
she
would
like
any
other
kind
better
.
<EOS>
A
lady
was
obliged
to
respond
to
these
things
suitably
;
and
even
if
she
had
not
shrunk
from
quarrelling
on
other
grounds
,
quarreling
with
Grandcourt
was
impossible
;
she
might
as
well
have
made
angry
remarks
to
a
dangerous
serpent
ornamentally
coiled
in
her
cabin
without
invitation
.
<EOS>
And
what
sort
of
dispute
could
a
woman
of
any
pride
and
dignity
begin
on
a
yacht
?
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
had
intense
satisfaction
in
leading
his
wife
captive
after
this
fashion
;
it
gave
their
life
on
a
small
scale
a
royal
representation
and
publicity
in
which
every
thing
familiar
was
got
rid
of
,
and
every
body
must
do
what
was
expected
of
them
whatever
might
be
their
private
protest
 
<EOS>
the
protest
(
kept
strictly
private
)
adding
to
the
piquancy
of
despotism
.
  
<EOS>
To
Gwendolen
,
who
even
in
the
freedom
of
her
maiden
time
,
had
had
very
faint
glimpses
of
any
heroism
or
sublimity
,
the
medium
that
now
thrust
itself
everywhere
before
her
view
was
this
husband
and
her
relation
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
beings
closest
to
us
,
whether
in
love
or
hate
,
are
often
virtually
our
interpreters
of
the
world
,
and
some
feather
-
headed
gentleman
or
lady
whom
in
passing
we
regret
to
take
as
legal
tender
for
a
human
being
,
may
be
acting
as
a
melancholy
theory
of
life
in
the
minds
of
those
who
live
with
them
 
like
a
piece
of
yellow
and
wavy
glass
that
distorts
form
and
makes
color
an
affliction
.
<EOS>
Their
trivial
sentences
,
their
petty
standards
,
their
low
suspicions
,
their
loveless
_
ennui
_
,
may
be
making
somebody
else
's
life
no
better
than
a
promenade
through
a
pantheon
of
ugly
idols
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
had
that
kind
of
window
before
her
,
affecting
the
distant
equally
with
the
near
.
<EOS>
Some
unhappy
wives
are
soothed
by
the
possibility
that
they
may
become
mothers
;
but
Gwendolen
felt
that
to
desire
a
child
for
herself
would
have
been
a
consenting
to
the
completion
of
the
injury
she
had
been
guilty
of
.
<EOS>
She
was
reduced
to
dread
lest
she
should
become
a
mother
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
the
image
of
a
new
sweetly
-
budding
life
that
came
as
a
vision
of
deliverance
from
the
monotony
of
distaste
:
it
was
an
image
of
another
sort
.
<EOS>
In
the
irritable
,
fluctuating
stages
of
despair
,
gleams
of
hope
came
in
the
form
of
some
possible
accident
.
<EOS>
To
dwell
on
the
benignity
of
accident
was
a
refuge
from
worse
temptation
.
  
<EOS>
The
embitterment
of
hatred
is
often
as
unaccountable
to
onlookers
as
the
growth
of
devoted
love
,
and
it
not
only
seems
but
is
really
out
of
direct
relation
with
any
outward
causes
to
be
alleged
.
<EOS>
Passion
is
of
the
nature
of
seed
,
and
finds
nourishment
within
,
tending
to
a
predominance
which
determines
all
currents
toward
itself
,
and
makes
the
whole
life
its
tributary
.
<EOS>
And
the
intensest
form
of
hatred
is
that
rooted
in
fear
,
which
compels
to
silence
and
drives
vehemence
into
a
constructive
vindictiveness
,
an
imaginary
annihilation
of
the
detested
object
,
something
like
the
hidden
rites
of
vengeance
with
which
the
persecuted
have
made
a
dark
vent
for
their
rage
,
and
soothed
their
suffering
into
dumbness
.
<EOS>
Such
hidden
rites
went
on
in
the
secrecy
of
Gwendolen
's
mind
,
but
not
with
soothing
effect
 
rather
with
the
effect
of
a
struggling
terror
.
<EOS>
Side
by
side
with
the
dread
of
her
husband
had
grown
the
self
-
dread
,
which
urged
her
to
flee
from
the
pursuing
images
wrought
by
her
pent
-
up
impulse
.
<EOS>
The
vision
of
her
past
wrong
-
doing
,
and
what
it
had
brought
on
her
,
came
with
a
pale
ghastly
illumination
over
every
imagined
deed
that
was
a
rash
effort
at
freedom
,
such
as
she
had
made
in
her
marriage
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
she
had
learned
to
see
all
her
acts
through
the
impression
they
would
make
on
Deronda
:
whatever
relief
might
come
to
her
,
she
could
not
sever
it
from
the
judgment
of
her
that
would
be
created
in
his
mind
.
<EOS>
Not
one
word
of
flattery
,
of
indulgence
,
of
dependence
on
her
favor
,
could
be
fastened
on
by
her
in
all
their
intercourse
,
to
weaken
his
restraining
power
over
her
(
in
this
way
Deronda
's
effort
over
himself
was
repaid
)
;
and
amid
the
dreary
uncertainties
of
her
spoiled
life
the
possible
remedies
that
lay
in
his
mind
,
nay
,
the
remedy
that
lay
in
her
feeling
for
him
,
made
her
only
hope
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
her
a
terrible
-
browed
angel
,
from
whom
she
could
not
think
of
concealing
any
deed
so
as
to
win
an
ignorant
regard
from
him
:
it
belonged
to
the
nature
of
their
relation
that
she
should
be
truthful
,
for
his
power
over
her
had
begun
in
the
raising
of
a
self
-
discontent
which
could
be
satisfied
only
by
genuine
change
.
<EOS>
But
in
no
concealment
had
she
now
any
confidence
:
<EOS>
her
vision
of
what
she
had
to
dread
took
more
decidedly
than
ever
the
form
of
some
fiercely
impulsive
deed
,
committed
as
in
a
dream
that
she
would
instantaneously
wake
from
to
find
the
effects
real
though
the
images
had
been
false
:
to
find
death
under
her
hands
,
but
instead
of
darkness
,
daylight
;
instead
of
satisfied
hatred
,
the
dismay
of
guilt
;
instead
of
freedom
,
the
palsy
of
a
new
terror
 
a
white
dead
face
from
which
she
was
forever
trying
to
flee
and
forever
held
back
.
<EOS>
She
remembered
Deronda
's
words
:
they
were
continually
recurring
in
her
thought
    
"
Turn
your
fear
into
a
safeguard
.
<EOS>
Keep
your
dread
fixed
on
the
idea
of
increasing
your
remorse
.
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
*
Take
your
fear
as
a
safeguard
.
<EOS>
It
is
like
quickness
of
hearing
.
<EOS>
It
may
make
consequences
passionately
present
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
so
it
was
.
<EOS>
In
Gwendolen
's
consciousness
temptation
and
dread
met
and
stared
like
two
pale
phantoms
,
each
seeing
itself
in
the
other
 
each
obstructed
by
its
own
image
;
and
all
the
while
her
fuller
self
beheld
the
apparitions
and
sobbed
for
deliverance
from
them
.
  
<EOS>
Inarticulate
prayers
,
no
more
definite
than
a
cry
,
often
swept
out
from
her
into
the
vast
silence
,
unbroken
except
by
her
husband
's
breathing
or
the
plash
of
the
wave
or
the
creaking
of
the
masts
;
but
if
ever
she
thought
of
definite
help
,
it
took
the
form
of
Deronda
's
presence
and
words
,
of
the
sympathy
he
might
have
for
her
,
of
the
direction
he
might
give
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
sometimes
after
a
white
-
lipped
fierce
-
eyed
temptation
with
murdering
fingers
had
made
its
demon
-
visit
that
these
best
moments
of
inward
crying
and
clinging
for
rescue
would
come
to
her
,
and
she
would
lie
with
wide
-
open
eyes
in
which
the
rising
tears
seemed
a
blessing
,
and
the
thought
,
"
I
will
not
mind
if
I
can
keep
from
getting
wicked
,
"
seemed
an
answer
to
the
indefinite
prayer
.
  
<EOS>
So
the
days
passed
,
taking
with
them
light
breezes
beyond
and
about
the
Balearic
Isles
,
and
then
to
Sardinia
,
and
then
with
gentle
change
persuading
them
northward
again
toward
Corsica
.
<EOS>
But
this
floating
,
gentle
-
wafted
existence
,
with
its
apparently
peaceful
influences
,
was
becoming
as
bad
as
a
nightmare
to
Gwendolen
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
long
are
we
to
be
yachting
?
<EOS>
"
she
ventured
to
ask
one
day
after
they
had
been
touching
at
Ajaccio
,
and
the
mere
fact
of
change
in
going
ashore
had
given
her
a
relief
from
some
of
the
thoughts
which
seemed
now
to
cling
about
the
very
rigging
of
the
vessel
,
mix
with
the
air
in
the
red
silk
<EOS>
cabin
below
,
and
make
the
smell
of
the
sea
odious
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
else
should
we
do
?
"
said
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
tired
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
see
why
we
should
n't
stay
out
any
length
of
time
.
<EOS>
There
's
less
to
bore
one
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
And
where
would
you
go
to
?
<EOS>
I
'm
sick
of
foreign
places
.
<EOS>
And
we
shall
have
enough
of
Ryelands
.
<EOS>
Would
you
rather
be
at
Ryelands
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
indifferently
,
finding
all
places
alike
undescribable
as
soon
as
she
imagined
herself
and
her
husband
in
them
.
<EOS>
"
I
only
wondered
how
long
you
would
like
this
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
like
yachting
longer
than
anything
else
,
"
said
Grandcourt
;
<EOS>
"
and
I
had
none
last
year
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
are
beginning
to
tire
of
it
.
<EOS>
Women
are
so
confoundedly
whimsical
.
<EOS>
They
expect
everything
to
give
way
to
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear
,
no
!
"
said
Gwendolen
,
letting
out
her
scorn
in
a
flute
-
like
tone
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
expect
you
to
give
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
I
?
"
said
Grandcourt
,
with
his
inward
voice
,
looking
at
her
,
and
then
choosing
an
orange
 
for
they
were
at
table
.
  
<EOS>
She
made
up
her
mind
to
a
length
of
yatching
that
she
could
not
see
beyond
;
but
the
next
day
,
after
a
squall
which
had
made
her
rather
ill
for
the
first
time
,
he
came
down
to
her
and
said
    
"
There
's
been
the
devil
's
own
work
in
the
night
.
<EOS>
The
skipper
says
we
shall
have
to
stay
at
Genoa
for
a
week
while
things
are
set
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mind
that
?
"
said
Gwendolen
,
who
lay
looking
very
white
amidst
her
white
drapery
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
so
.
<EOS>
Who
wants
to
be
broiling
at
Genoa
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
a
change
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
made
a
little
incautious
by
her
languor
.
  
<EOS>
"
_
I
_
do
n't
want
any
change
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
the
place
is
intolerable
;
and
one
ca
n't
move
along
the
roads
.
<EOS>
I
shall
go
out
in
a
boat
,
as
I
used
to
do
,
and
manage
it
myself
.
<EOS>
One
can
get
a
few
hours
every
day
in
that
way
instead
of
striving
in
a
damnable
hotel
.
"
  
<EOS>
Here
was
a
prospect
which
held
hope
in
it
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
thought
of
hours
when
she
would
be
alone
,
since
Grandcourt
would
not
want
to
take
her
in
the
said
boat
,
and
in
her
exultation
at
this
unlooked
-
for
relief
,
she
had
wild
,
contradictory
fancies
of
what
she
might
do
with
her
freedom
 
<EOS>
that
"
running
away
"
which
she
had
already
innumerable
times
seen
to
be
a
worse
evil
than
any
actual
endurance
,
now
finding
new
arguments
as
an
escape
from
her
worse
self
.
<EOS>
Also
,
visionary
relief
on
a
par
with
the
fancy
of
a
prisoner
that
the
night
wind
may
blow
down
the
wall
of
his
prison
and
save
him
from
desperate
devices
,
insinuated
itself
as
a
better
alternative
,
lawful
to
wish
for
.
  
<EOS>
The
fresh
current
of
expectation
revived
her
energies
,
and
enabled
her
to
take
all
things
with
an
air
of
cheerfulness
and
alacrity
that
made
a
change
marked
enough
to
be
noticed
by
her
husband
.
<EOS>
She
watched
through
the
evening
lights
to
the
sinking
of
the
moon
with
less
of
awed
loneliness
than
was
habitual
to
her
 
nay
,
with
a
vague
impression
that
in
this
mighty
frame
of
things
there
might
be
some
preparation
of
rescue
for
her
.
<EOS>
Why
not
?
 
<EOS>
since
the
weather
had
just
been
on
her
side
.
<EOS>
This
possibility
of
hoping
,
after
her
long
fluctuation
amid
fears
,
was
like
a
first
return
of
hunger
to
the
long
-
languishing
patient
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
waked
the
next
morning
by
the
casting
of
the
anchor
in
the
port
of
Genoa
 
<EOS>
waked
from
a
strangely
-
mixed
dream
in
which
she
felt
herself
escaping
over
the
Mont
Cenis
,
and
wondering
to
find
it
warmer
even
in
the
moonlight
on
the
snow
,
till
suddenly
she
met
Deronda
,
who
told
her
to
go
back
.
  
<EOS>
In
an
hour
or
so
from
that
dream
she
actually
met
Deronda
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
on
the
palatial
staircase
of
the
_
Italia
_
,
where
she
was
feeling
warm
in
her
light
woolen
dress
and
straw
hat
;
and
her
husband
was
by
her
side
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
start
of
surprise
in
Deronda
before
he
could
raise
his
hat
and
pass
on
.
<EOS>
The
moment
did
not
seem
to
favor
any
closer
greeting
,
and
the
circumstances
under
which
they
had
last
parted
made
him
doubtful
whether
Grandcourt
would
be
civilly
inclined
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
doubt
might
certainly
have
been
changed
into
a
disagreeable
certainty
,
for
Grandcourt
on
this
unaccountable
appearance
of
Deronda
at
Genoa
of
all
places
,
immediately
tried
to
conceive
how
there
could
have
been
an
arrangement
between
him
and
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
It
is
true
that
before
they
were
well
in
their
rooms
,
he
had
seen
how
difficult
it
was
to
shape
such
an
arrangement
with
any
probability
,
being
too
cool
-
headed
to
find
it
at
once
easily
credible
that
Gwendolen
had
not
only
while
in
London
hastened
to
inform
Deronda
of
the
yachting
project
,
but
had
posted
a
letter
to
him
from
Marseilles
or
Barcelona
,
advising
him
to
travel
to
Genoa
in
time
for
the
chance
of
meeting
her
there
,
or
of
receiving
a
letter
from
her
telling
of
some
other
destination
 
all
which
must
have
implied
a
miraculous
foreknowledge
in
her
,
and
in
Deronda
a
bird
-
like
facility
in
flying
about
and
perching
idly
.
<EOS>
Still
he
was
there
,
and
though
Grandcourt
would
not
make
a
fool
of
himself
by
fabrications
that
others
might
call
preposterous
,
he
was
not
,
for
all
that
,
disposed
to
admit
fully
that
Deronda
's
presence
was
,
so
far
as
Gwendolen
was
concerned
,
a
mere
accident
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
disgusting
fact
;
that
was
enough
;
and
no
doubt
she
was
well
pleased
.
<EOS>
A
man
out
of
temper
does
not
wait
for
proofs
before
feeling
toward
all
things
animate
and
inanimate
as
if
they
were
in
a
conspiracy
against
him
,
but
at
once
threshes
his
horse
or
kicks
his
dog
in
consequence
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
felt
toward
Gwendolen
and
Deronda
as
if
he
knew
them
to
be
in
a
conspiracy
against
him
,
and
here
was
an
event
in
league
with
them
.
<EOS>
What
he
took
for
clearly
certain
 
<EOS>
and
so
far
he
divined
the
truth
 
<EOS>
was
that
Gwendolen
was
now
counting
on
an
interview
with
Deronda
whenever
her
husband
's
back
was
turned
.
  
<EOS>
As
he
sat
taking
his
coffee
at
a
convenient
angle
for
observing
her
,
he
discerned
something
which
he
felt
sure
<EOS>
was
the
effect
of
a
secret
delight
 
some
fresh
ease
in
moving
and
speaking
,
some
peculiar
meaning
in
her
eyes
,
whatever
she
looked
on
.
<EOS>
Certainly
her
troubles
had
not
marred
her
beauty
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Grandcourt
was
handsomer
than
Gwendolen
Harleth
<EOS>
:
her
grace
and
expression
were
informed
by
a
greater
variety
of
inward
experience
,
giving
new
play
to
her
features
,
new
attitudes
in
movement
and
repose
;
her
whole
person
and
air
had
the
nameless
something
which
often
makes
a
woman
more
interesting
after
marriage
than
before
,
less
confident
that
all
things
are
according
to
her
opinion
,
and
yet
with
less
of
deer
-
like
shyness
 
more
fully
a
human
being
.
  
<EOS>
This
morning
the
benefits
of
the
voyage
seemed
to
be
suddenly
revealing
themselves
in
a
new
elasticity
of
mien
.
<EOS>
As
she
rose
from
the
table
and
put
her
two
heavily
-
jewelled
hands
on
each
side
of
her
neck
,
according
to
her
wo
nt
,
she
had
no
art
to
conceal
that
sort
of
joyous
expectation
which
makes
the
present
more
bearable
than
usual
,
just
as
when
a
man
means
to
go
out
<EOS>
he
finds
it
easier
to
be
amiable
to
the
family
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
beforehand
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
impossible
that
a
terrier
whose
pleasure
was
concerned
would
perceive
those
amiable
signs
and
know
their
meaning
 
know
why
his
master
stood
in
a
peculiar
way
,
talked
with
alacrity
,
and
even
had
a
peculiar
gleam
in
his
eye
,
so
that
on
the
least
movement
toward
the
door
,
the
terrier
would
scuttle
to
be
in
time
.
<EOS>
And
,
in
dog
fashion
,
Grandcourt
discerned
the
signs
of
Gwendolen
's
expectation
,
interpreting
them
with
the
narrow
correctness
which
leaves
a
world
of
unknown
feeling
behind
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
 
just
ring
,
please
,
and
tell
Gibbs
to
order
some
dinner
for
us
at
three
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
as
he
too
rose
,
took
out
a
cigar
,
and
then
stretched
his
hand
toward
the
hat
that
lay
near
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
going
to
send
Angus
to
find
a
little
sailing
-
boat
for
us
to
go
out
in
;
one
that
I
can
manage
,
with
you
at
the
tiller
.
<EOS>
It
's
uncommonly
pleasant
these
fine
evenings
 
the
least
boring
of
anything
we
can
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
turned
cold
.
<EOS>
There
was
not
only
the
cruel
disappointment
;
there
was
the
immediate
conviction
that
her
husband
had
determined
to
take
her
because
he
would
not
leave
her
out
of
his
sight
;
and
probably
this
dual
solitude
in
a
boat
was
the
more
attractive
to
him
because
it
would
be
wearisome
to
her
.
<EOS>
They
were
not
on
the
plank
-
island
;
she
felt
it
the
more
possible
to
begin
a
contest
.
<EOS>
But
the
gleaming
content
had
died
out
of
her
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
change
in
her
like
that
of
a
glacier
after
sunset
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
not
go
in
the
boat
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Take
some
one
else
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
;
if
you
do
n't
go
,
I
shall
not
go
,
"
said
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
stay
suffocating
here
,
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
bear
to
go
in
a
boat
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
angrily
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
a
sudden
change
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
with
a
slight
sneer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
since
you
decline
,
we
shall
stay
indoors
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
laid
down
his
hat
again
,
lit
his
cigar
,
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
,
pausing
now
and
then
to
look
out
of
the
windows
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
temper
told
her
to
persist
.
<EOS>
She
knew
very
well
now
that
Grandcourt
would
not
go
without
her
;
but
if
he
must
tyrannize
over
her
,
he
should
not
do
it
precisely
in
the
way
he
would
choose
.
<EOS>
She
would
oblige
him
to
stay
in
the
hotel
.
<EOS>
Without
speaking
again
,
she
passed
into
the
adjoining
bedroom
and
threw
herself
into
a
chair
with
her
anger
,
seeing
no
purpose
or
issue
 
<EOS>
only
feeling
that
the
wave
of
evil
had
rushed
back
upon
her
,
and
dragged
her
away
from
her
momentary
breathing
-
place
.
  
<EOS>
Presently
Grandcourt
came
in
with
his
hat
on
,
but
threw
it
off
and
sat
down
sideways
on
a
chair
nearly
in
front
of
her
,
saying
,
in
his
superficial
drawl
    
"
Have
you
come
round
yet
?
<EOS>
or
do
you
find
it
agreeable
to
be
out
of
temper
.
<EOS>
You
make
things
uncommonly
pleasant
for
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
want
to
make
them
unpleasant
for
_
me
_
?
"
said
Gwendolen
,
getting
helpless
again
,
and
feeling
the
hot
tears
rise
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
will
you
be
good
enough
to
say
what
it
is
you
have
to
complain
of
?
"
said
Grandcourt
,
looking
into
her
eyes
,
and
using
his
most
inward
voice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Is
it
that
I
stay
indoors
when
you
stay
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
could
give
no
answer
.
<EOS>
The
sort
of
truth
that
made
any
excuse
for
her
anger
could
not
be
uttered
.
<EOS>
In
the
conflict
of
despair
and
humiliation
she
began
to
sob
,
and
the
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks
 
<EOS>
a
form
of
agitation
which
she
had
never
shown
before
in
her
husband
's
presence
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
this
is
useful
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
after
a
moment
or
two
.
<EOS>
"
All
I
can
say
is
,
it
's
most
confoundedly
unpleasant
.
<EOS>
What
the
devil
women
can
see
in
this
kind
of
thing
,
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
_
You
_
see
something
to
be
got
by
it
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
All
I
can
see
is
,
that
we
shall
be
shut
up
here
when
we
might
have
been
having
a
pleasant
sail
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
go
,
then
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
impetuously
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
we
shall
be
drowned
.
<EOS>
"
She
began
to
sob
again
.
  
<EOS>
This
extraordinary
behavior
,
which
had
evidently
some
relation
to
Deronda
,
gave
more
definiteness
to
Grandcourt
's
conclusions
.
<EOS>
He
drew
his
chair
quite
close
in
front
of
her
,
and
said
,
in
a
low
tone
,
"
Just
be
quiet
and
listen
,
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
There
seemed
to
be
a
magical
effect
in
this
close
vicinity
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
shrank
and
ceased
to
sob
.
<EOS>
She
kept
her
eyelids
down
and
clasped
her
hands
tightly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
understand
each
other
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
in
the
same
tone
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
very
well
what
this
nonsense
means
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
suppose
I
am
going
to
let
you
make
a
fool
of
me
,
just
dismiss
that
notion
from
your
mind
.
<EOS>
What
are
you
looking
forward
to
,
if
you
ca
n't
behave
properly
as
my
wife
?
<EOS>
There
is
disgrace
for
you
,
if
you
like
to
have
it
,
but
I
do
n't
know
anything
else
;
and
as
to
Deronda
,
it
's
quite
clear
that
he
hangs
back
from
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
false
!
"
<EOS>
said
Gwendolen
,
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
do
n't
in
the
least
imagine
what
is
in
my
mind
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
enough
of
the
disgrace
that
comes
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
And
you
had
better
leave
me
at
liberty
to
speak
with
any
one
I
like
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
better
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
allow
me
to
judge
of
that
,
"
said
Grandcourt
,
rising
and
moving
to
a
little
distance
toward
the
window
,
but
standing
there
playing
with
his
whiskers
as
if
he
were
awaiting
something
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
words
had
so
clear
and
tremendous
<EOS>
a
meaning
for
herself
that
she
thought
they
must
have
expressed
it
to
Grandcourt
,
and
had
no
sooner
uttered
them
than
she
dreaded
their
effect
.
<EOS>
But
his
soul
was
garrisoned
against
presentiments
and
fears
:
he
had
the
courage
and
confidence
that
belong
to
domination
,
and
he
was
at
that
moment
feeling
perfectly
satisfied
that
he
held
his
wife
with
bit
and
bridle
.
<EOS>
By
the
time
they
had
been
married
a
year
she
would
cease
to
be
restive
.
<EOS>
He
continued
standing
with
his
air
of
indifference
,
till
she
felt
her
habitual
stifling
consciousness
of
having
an
immovable
obstruction
in
her
life
,
like
the
nightmare
of
beholding
a
single
form
that
serves
to
arrest
all
passage
though
the
wide
country
lies
open
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
decision
have
you
come
to
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
presently
looking
at
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
orders
shall
I
give
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
let
us
go
,
"
said
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
The
walls
had
begun
to
be
an
imprisonment
,
and
while
there
was
breath
in
this
man
he
would
have
the
mastery
over
her
.
<EOS>
His
words
had
the
power
of
thumb
-
screws
and
the
cold
touch
of
the
rock
.
<EOS>
To
resist
was
to
act
like
a
stupid
animal
unable
to
measure
results
.
  
<EOS>
So
the
boat
was
ordered
.
<EOS>
She
even
went
down
to
the
quay
again
with
him
to
see
it
before
midday
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
had
recovered
perfect
quietude
of
temper
,
and
had
a
scornful
satisfaction
in
the
attention
given
by
the
nautical
groups
to
the
_
milord
_
,
owner
of
the
handsome
yacht
which
had
just
put
in
for
repairs
,
and
who
being
an
Englishman
was
naturally
so
at
home
on
the
sea
that
he
could
manage
a
sail
with
the
same
ease
that
he
could
manage
a
horse
.
<EOS>
The
sort
of
exultation
he
had
discerned
in
Gwendolen
this
morning
<EOS>
she
now
thought
that
she
discerned
in
him
;
and
it
was
true
that
he
had
set
his
mind
on
this
boating
,
and
carried
out
his
purpose
as
something
that
people
might
not
expect
him
to
do
,
with
the
gratified
impulse
of
a
strong
will
which
had
nothing
better
to
exert
itself
upon
.
<EOS>
He
had
remarkable
physical
courage
,
and
was
proud
of
it
 
or
rather
he
had
a
great
contempt
for
the
coarser
,
bulkier
men
who
generally
had
less
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
he
was
ruling
that
Gwendolen
should
go
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
And
when
they
came
down
again
at
five
o'clock
,
equipped
for
their
boating
,
the
scene
was
as
good
as
a
theatrical
representation
for
all
beholders
.
<EOS>
This
handsome
,
fair
-
skinned
English
couple
,
manifesting
the
usual
eccentricity
of
their
nation
,
both
of
them
proud
,
pale
,
and
calm
,
without
a
smile
on
their
faces
,
moving
like
creatures
who
were
fulfilling
a
supernatural
destiny
 
<EOS>
it
was
a
thing
to
go
out
and
see
,
a
thing
to
paint
.
<EOS>
The
husband
's
chest
,
back
,
and
arms
,
showed
very
well
in
his
close
-
fitting
dress
,
and
the
wife
was
declared
to
be
a
statue
.
  
<EOS>
Some
suggestions
were
proffered
concerning
a
possible
change
in
the
breeze
,
and
the
necessary
care
in
putting
about
,
but
Grandcourt
's
manner
made
the
speakers
understand
that
they
were
too
officious
,
and
that
he
knew
better
than
they
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
keeping
her
impassable
air
,
as
they
moved
away
from
the
strand
,
felt
her
imagination
obstinately
at
work
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
afraid
of
any
outward
dangers
 
<EOS>
she
was
afraid
of
her
own
wishes
which
were
taking
shapes
possible
and
impossible
,
like
a
cloud
of
demon
-
faces
.
<EOS>
She
was
afraid
of
her
own
hatred
,
which
under
the
cold
iron
touch
that
had
compelled
her
to
-
day
had
gathered
a
fierce
intensity
.
<EOS>
As
she
sat
guiding
the
tiller
under
her
husband
's
eyes
,
doing
just
what
he
told
her
,
the
strife
within
her
seemed
like
her
own
effort
to
escape
from
herself
.
<EOS>
She
clung
to
the
thought
of
Deronda
:
she
persuaded
herself
that
he
would
not
go
away
while
she
was
there
 
<EOS>
he
knew
that
she
needed
help
.
<EOS>
The
sense
that
he
was
there
would
save
her
from
acting
out
the
evil
within
.
<EOS>
And
yet
quick
,
quick
,
came
images
,
plans
of
evil
that
would
come
again
and
seize
her
in
the
night
,
like
furies
preparing
the
deed
that
they
would
straightway
avenge
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
taken
out
of
the
port
and
carried
eastward
by
a
gentle
breeze
.
<EOS>
Some
clouds
tempered
the
sunlight
,
and
the
hour
was
always
deepening
toward
the
supreme
beauty
of
evening
.
<EOS>
Sails
larger
and
smaller
changed
their
aspect
like
sensitive
things
,
and
made
a
cheerful
companionship
,
alternately
near
and
far
.
<EOS>
The
grand
city
shone
more
vaguely
,
the
mountains
looked
out
above
it
,
and
there
was
stillness
as
in
an
island
sanctuary
.
<EOS>
Yet
suddenly
Gwendolen
let
her
hands
fall
,
and
said
in
a
scarcely
audible
tone
,
"
God
help
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
"
said
Grandcourt
,
not
distinguishing
the
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
nothing
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
rousing
herself
from
her
momentary
forgetfulness
and
resuming
the
ropes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
find
this
pleasant
?
"
said
Grandcourt
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
admit
now
we
could
n't
have
done
anything
better
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
 
I
see
nothing
better
.
<EOS>
I
think
we
shall
go
on
always
,
like
the
Flying
Dutchman
,
"
said
Gwendolen
wildly
.
  
<EOS>
Grandcourt
gave
her
one
of
his
narrow
examining
glances
,
and
then
said
,
"
If
you
like
,
we
can
go
to
Spezia
in
the
morning
,
and
let
them
take
us
up
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
shall
like
nothing
better
than
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Very
well
:
we
'll
do
the
same
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
But
we
must
be
turning
in
soon
.
<EOS>
I
shall
put
about
.
"
            
<EOS>
"
Ritorna
a
tua
scienza
  
<EOS>
Che
vuoi
,
quanto
<EOS>
la
cosa
<EOS>
e
più
perfetta
  
<EOS>
Più
senta
if

e

DANTE
.
   
<EOS>
When
Deronda
met
Gwendolen
and
Grandcourt
on
the
staircase
,
his
mind
was
seriously
preoccupied
.
<EOS>
He
had
just
been
summoned
to
the
second
interview
with
his
mother
.
  
<EOS>
In
two
hours
after
his
parting
from
her
he
knew
that
the
Princess
Halm
-
Eberstein
had
left
the
hotel
,
and
so
far
as
the
purpose
of
his
journey
to
Genoa
was
concerned
,
he
might
himself
have
set
off
on
his
way
to
Mainz
,
to
deliver
the
letter
from
Joseph
Kalonymos
,
and
get
possession
of
the
family
chest
.
<EOS>
But
mixed
mental
conditions
,
which
did
not
resolve
themselves
into
definite
reasons
,
hindered
him
from
departure
.
<EOS>
Long
after
the
farewell
he
was
kept
passive
by
a
weight
of
retrospective
feeling
.
<EOS>
He
lived
again
,
with
the
new
keenness
of
emotive
memory
,
through
the
exciting
scenes
which
seemed
past
only
in
the
sense
of
preparation
for
their
actual
presence
in
his
soul
.
<EOS>
He
allowed
himself
in
his
solitude
to
sob
,
with
perhaps
more
than
a
woman
's
acuteness
of
compassion
,
over
that
woman
's
life
so
near
to
his
,
and
yet
so
remote
.
<EOS>
He
beheld
the
world
changed
for
him
by
the
certitude
of
ties
that
altered
the
poise
of
hopes
and
fears
,
and
gave
him
a
new
sense
of
fellowship
,
as
if
under
cover
of
the
night
he
had
joined
the
wrong
band
of
wanderers
,
and
found
with
the
rise
of
morning
that
the
tents
of
his
kindred
were
grouped
far
off
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
quivering
imaginative
sense
of
close
relation
to
the
grandfather
who
had
been
animated
by
strong
impulses
and
beloved
thoughts
,
which
were
now
perhaps
being
roused
from
their
slumber
within
himself
.
<EOS>
And
through
all
this
passionate
meditation
Mordecai
and
Mirah
were
always
present
,
as
beings
who
clasped
hands
with
him
in
sympathetic
silence
.
  
<EOS>
Of
such
quick
,
responsive
fibre
was
Deronda
made
,
under
that
mantle
of
self
-
controlled
reserve
into
which
early
experience
had
thrown
so
much
of
his
young
strength
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
persistent
ringing
of
a
bell
as
a
signal
reminded
him
of
the
hour
he
thought
of
looking
into
_
Bradshaw
_
,
and
making
the
brief
necessary
preparations
for
starting
by
the
next
train
 
thought
of
it
,
but
made
no
movement
in
consequence
.
<EOS>
Wishes
went
to
Mainz
and
what
he
was
to
get
possession
of
there
 
to
London
and
the
beings
there
who
made
the
strongest
attachments
of
his
life
;
but
there
were
other
wishes
that
clung
in
these
moments
to
Genoa
,
and
they
kept
him
where
he
was
by
that
force
which
urges
us
to
linger
over
an
interview
that
carries
a
presentiment
of
final
farewell
or
of
overshadowing
sorrow
.
<EOS>
Deronda
did
not
formally
say
,
"
I
will
stay
over
to
-
night
,
because
it
is
Friday
,
and
I
should
like
to
go
to
the
evening
service
at
the
synagogue
where
they
must
all
have
gone
;
and
besides
,
I
may
see
the
Grandcourts
again
.
"
<EOS>
But
simply
,
instead
of
packing
and
ringing
for
his
bill
,
he
sat
doing
nothing
at
all
,
while
his
mind
went
to
the
synagogue
and
saw
faces
there
probably
little
different
from
those
of
his
grandfather
's
time
,
and
heard
the
Spanish
-
Hebrew
liturgy
which
had
lasted
through
the
seasons
of
wandering
generations
like
a
plant
with
wandering
seed
,
that
gives
the
far
-
off
lands
a
kinship
to
the
exile
's
home
 
<EOS>
while
,
also
,
his
mind
went
toward
Gwendolen
,
with
anxious
remembrance
of
what
had
been
,
and
with
a
half
-
admitted
impression
that
it
would
be
hardness
in
him
willingly
to
go
away
at
once
without
making
some
effort
,
in
spite
of
Grandcourt
's
probable
dislike
,
to
manifest
the
continuance
of
his
sympathy
with
her
since
their
abrupt
parting
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
state
of
mind
he
deferred
departure
,
ate
his
dinner
without
sense
of
flavor
,
rose
from
it
quickly
to
find
the
synagogue
,
and
in
passing
the
porter
<EOS>
asked
if
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Grandcourt
were
still
in
the
hotel
,
and
what
was
the
number
of
their
apartment
.
<EOS>
The
porter
gave
him
the
number
,
but
added
that
they
were
gone
out
boating
.
<EOS>
That
information
had
somehow
power
enough
over
Deronda
to
divide
his
thoughts
with
the
memories
<EOS>
wakened
among
the
sparse
_
talithim
_
and
keen
dark
faces
of
worshippers
whose
way
of
taking
awful
prayers
and
invocations
with
the
easy
familiarity
which
might
be
called
Hebrew
dyed
Italian
,
made
him
reflect
that
his
grandfather
,
according
to
the
Princess
's
hints
of
his
character
,
must
have
been
almost
as
exceptional
a
Jew
as
Mordecai
.
<EOS>
But
were
not
men
of
ardent
zeal
and
far
-
reaching
hope
everywhere
exceptional
?
<EOS>
the
men
who
had
the
visions
which
,
as
Mordecai
said
,
were
the
creators
and
feeders
of
the
world
 
moulding
and
feeding
the
more
passive
life
which
without
them
would
dwindle
and
shrivel
into
the
narrow
tenacity
of
insects
,
unshaken
by
thoughts
beyond
the
reach
of
their
antennae
.
<EOS>
Something
of
a
mournful
impatience
perhaps
added
itself
to
the
solicitude
about
Gwendolen
(
a
solicitude
that
had
room
to
grow
in
his
present
release
from
immediate
cares
)
as
an
incitement
to
hasten
from
the
synagogue
and
choose
to
take
his
evening
walk
toward
the
quay
,
always
a
favorite
haunt
with
him
,
and
just
now
attractive
with
the
possibility
that
he
might
be
in
time
to
see
the
Grandcourts
come
in
from
their
boating
.
<EOS>
In
this
case
,
he
resolved
that
he
would
advance
to
greet
them
deliberately
,
and
ignore
any
grounds
that
the
husband
might
have
for
wishing
him
elsewhere
.
  
<EOS>
The
sun
had
set
behind
a
bank
of
cloud
,
and
only
a
faint
yellow
light
was
giving
its
farewell
kisses
to
the
waves
,
which
were
agitated
by
an
active
breeze
.
<EOS>
Deronda
,
sauntering
slowly
within
sight
of
what
took
place
on
the
strand
,
observed
the
groups
there
concentrating
their
attention
on
a
sailing
-
boat
which
was
advancing
swiftly
landward
,
being
rowed
by
two
men
.
<EOS>
Amidst
the
clamorous
talk
in
various
languages
,
Deronda
held
it
the
surer
means
of
getting
information
not
to
ask
questions
,
but
to
elbow
his
way
to
the
foreground
and
be
an
unobstructed
witness
of
what
was
occurring
.
<EOS>
Telescopes
were
being
used
,
and
loud
statements
made
that
the
boat
held
somebody
who
had
been
drowned
.
<EOS>
One
said
it
was
the
_
milord
_
who
had
gone
out
in
a
sailing
boat
;
another
maintained
that
the
prostrate
figure
he
discerned
was
_
miladi
_
;
<EOS>
a
Frenchman
who
had
no
glass
would
rather
say
that
it
was
_
milord
_
who
had
probably
taken
his
wife
out
to
drown
her
,
according
to
the
national
practice
 
a
remark
which
an
English
skipper
immediately
commented
on
in
our
native
idiom
(
as
nonsense
which
 
had
undergone
a
mining
operation
)
,
and
further
dismissed
by
the
decision
that
the
reclining
figure
was
a
woman
.
<EOS>
For
Deronda
,
terribly
excited
by
fluctuating
fears
,
the
strokes
of
the
oars
as
he
watched
them
were
divided
by
swift
visions
of
events
,
possible
and
impossible
,
which
might
have
brought
about
this
issue
,
or
this
broken
-
off
fragment
of
an
issue
,
with
a
worse
half
undisclosed
 
if
this
woman
apparently
snatched
from
the
waters
were
really
Mrs.
Grandcourt
.
  
<EOS>
But
soon
there
was
no
longer
any
doubt
:
the
boat
was
being
pulled
to
land
,
and
he
saw
Gwendolen
<EOS>
half
raising
herself
on
her
hands
,
by
her
own
effort
,
under
her
heavy
covering
of
tarpaulin
and
pea
-
jackets
 
pale
as
one
of
the
sheeted
dead
,
shivering
,
with
wet
hair
streaming
,
a
wild
amazed
consciousness
in
her
eyes
,
as
if
she
had
waked
up
in
a
world
where
some
judgment
was
impending
,
and
the
beings
she
saw
around
were
coming
to
seize
her
.
<EOS>
The
first
rower
who
jumped
to
land
was
also
wet
through
,
and
ran
off
;
the
sailors
,
close
about
the
boat
,
hindered
Deronda
from
advancing
,
and
he
could
only
look
on
while
Gwendolen
gave
scared
glances
,
and
seemed
to
shrink
with
terror
as
she
was
carefully
,
tenderly
helped
out
,
and
led
on
by
the
strong
arms
of
those
rough
,
bronzed
men
,
her
wet
clothes
clinging
about
her
limbs
,
and
adding
to
the
impediment
of
her
weakness
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
her
wandering
eyes
fell
on
Deronda
,
standing
before
her
,
and
immediately
,
as
if
she
had
been
expecting
him
and
looking
for
him
<EOS>
,
she
tried
to
stretch
out
her
arms
,
which
were
held
back
by
her
supporters
,
saying
,
in
a
muffled
voice
    
<EOS>
"
It
is
come
,
it
is
come
!
<EOS>
He
is
dead
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
hush
!
"
said
Deronda
,
in
a
tone
of
authority
;
"
quiet
yourself
.
"
<EOS>
Then
to
the
men
who
were
assisting
her
,
"
I
am
a
connection
of
this
lady
's
husband
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
get
her
on
to
the
_
Italia
_
as
quickly
as
possible
,
I
will
undertake
everything
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
stayed
behind
to
hear
from
the
remaining
boatman
that
her
husband
had
gone
down
irrecoverably
,
and
that
his
boat
was
left
floating
empty
.
<EOS>
He
and
his
comrade
had
heard
a
cry
,
had
come
up
in
time
to
see
the
lady
jump
in
after
her
husband
,
and
had
got
her
out
fast
enough
to
save
her
from
much
damage
.
  
<EOS>
After
this
,
Deronda
hastened
to
the
hotel
to
assure
himself
that
the
best
medical
help
would
be
provided
;
and
being
satisfied
on
this
point
,
he
telegraphed
the
event
to
Sir
Hugo
,
begging
him
to
come
forthwith
,
and
also
to
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
whose
address
at
the
rectory
made
his
nearest
known
way
of
getting
the
information
to
Gwendolen
's
mother
.
<EOS>
Certain
words
of
Gwendolen
's
in
the
past
had
come
back
to
him
with
the
effectiveness
of
an
inspiration
:
in
moments
of
agitated
confession
she
had
spoken
of
her
mother
's
presence
,
as
a
possible
help
,
if
she
could
have
had
it
.
      
<EOS>
"
The
pang
,
the
curse
with
which
they
died
,
    
Had
never
passed
away
:
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
draw
my
eyes
from
theirs
,
    
Nor
lift
them
up
to
pray
.

COLERIDGE
.
   
<EOS>
Deronda
did
not
take
off
his
clothes
that
night
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
after
insisting
on
seeing
him
again
before
she
would
consent
to
be
undressed
,
had
been
perfectly
quiet
,
and
had
only
asked
him
,
with
a
whispering
,
repressed
eagerness
,
to
promise
that
he
would
come
to
her
when
she
sent
for
him
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
Still
,
the
possibility
that
a
change
might
come
over
her
,
the
danger
of
a
supervening
feverish
condition
,
and
the
suspicion
that
something
in
the
late
catastrophe
was
having
an
effect
which
might
betray
itself
in
excited
words
,
acted
as
a
foreboding
within
him
.
<EOS>
He
mentioned
to
her
attendant
that
he
should
keep
himself
ready
to
be
called
if
there
were
any
alarming
change
of
symptoms
,
making
it
understood
by
all
concerned
that
he
was
in
communication
with
her
friends
in
England
,
and
felt
bound
meanwhile
to
take
all
care
on
her
behalf
 
a
position
which
it
was
the
easier
for
him
to
assume
,
because
he
was
well
known
to
Grandcourt
's
valet
,
the
only
old
servant
who
had
come
on
the
late
voyage
.
  
<EOS>
But
when
fatigue
from
the
strangely
various
emotion
of
the
day
at
last
sent
Deronda
to
sleep
<EOS>
,
he
remained
undisturbed
except
by
the
morning
dreams
,
which
came
as
a
tangled
web
of
yesterday
's
events
,
and
finally
waked
him
,
with
an
image
drawn
by
his
pressing
anxiety
.
  
<EOS>
Still
,
it
was
morning
,
and
there
had
been
no
summons
 
<EOS>
an
augury
which
cheered
him
while
he
made
his
toilet
,
and
reflected
that
it
was
too
early
to
send
inquiries
.
<EOS>
Later
,
he
learned
that
she
had
passed
a
too
wakeful
night
,
but
had
shown
no
violent
signs
of
agitation
,
and
was
at
last
sleeping
.
<EOS>
He
wondered
at
the
force
that
dwelt
in
this
creature
,
so
alive
to
dread
;
for
he
had
an
irresistible
impression
that
even
under
the
effects
of
a
severe
physical
shock
she
was
mastering
herself
with
a
determination
of
concealment
.
<EOS>
For
his
own
part
,
he
thought
that
his
sensibilities
had
been
blunted
by
what
he
had
been
going
through
in
the
meeting
with
his
mother
:
he
seemed
to
himself
now
to
be
only
fulfilling
claims
,
and
his
more
passionate
sympathy
was
in
abeyance
.
<EOS>
He
had
lately
been
living
so
keenly
in
an
experience
quite
apart
from
Gwendolen
's
lot
,
that
his
present
cares
for
her
were
like
a
revisiting
of
scenes
familiar
in
the
past
,
and
there
was
not
yet
a
complete
revival
of
the
inward
response
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
he
employed
himself
in
getting
a
formal
,
legally
recognized
statement
from
the
fisherman
who
had
rescued
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
Few
details
came
to
light
.
<EOS>
The
boat
in
which
Grandcourt
had
gone
out
had
been
found
drifting
with
its
sail
loose
,
and
had
been
towed
in
.
<EOS>
The
fishermen
thought
it
likely
that
he
had
been
knocked
overboard
by
the
flapping
of
the
sail
while
putting
about
,
and
that
he
had
not
known
how
to
swim
;
but
,
though
they
were
near
,
their
attention
had
been
first
arrested
by
a
cry
which
seemed
like
that
of
a
man
in
distress
,
and
while
they
were
hastening
with
their
oars
,
they
heard
a
shriek
from
the
lady
,
and
saw
her
jump
in
.
  
<EOS>
On
re
-
entering
the
hotel
,
Deronda
was
told
that
Gwendolen
had
risen
,
and
was
desiring
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
shown
into
a
room
darkened
by
blinds
and
curtains
,
where
she
was
seated
with
a
white
shawl
wrapped
round
her
,
looking
toward
the
opening
door
like
one
waiting
uneasily
.
<EOS>
But
her
long
hair
was
gathered
up
and
coiled
carefully
,
and
,
through
all
,
the
blue
stars
in
her
ears
had
kept
their
place
:
as
she
started
impulsively
to
her
full
height
,
sheathed
in
her
white
shawl
,
her
face
and
neck
not
less
white
,
except
for
a
purple
line
under
her
eyes
,
<EOS>
her
lips
a
little
apart
with
the
peculiar
expression
of
one
accused
and
helpless
<EOS>
,
she
looked
like
the
unhappy
ghost
of
that
Gwendolen
Harleth
whom
Deronda
had
seen
turning
with
firm
lips
and
proud
self
-
possession
from
her
losses
at
the
gaming
table
.
<EOS>
The
sight
pierced
him
with
pity
,
and
the
effects
of
all
their
past
relations
began
to
revive
within
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beseech
you
to
rest
 
not
to
stand
,
"
said
Deronda
,
as
he
approached
her
;
and
she
obeyed
,
falling
back
into
her
chair
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
sit
down
near
me
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
speak
very
low
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
in
a
large
arm
-
chair
,
and
he
drew
a
small
one
near
to
her
side
.
<EOS>
The
action
seemed
to
touch
her
peculiarly
:
turning
her
pale
face
full
upon
his
,
which
was
very
near
,
she
said
,
in
the
lowest
audible
tone
,
"
You
know
I
am
a
guilty
woman
?
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
himself
turned
paler
as
he
said
,
"
I
know
nothing
.
"
<EOS>
He
did
not
dare
to
say
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
dead
.
"
<EOS>
She
uttered
this
with
the
same
undertoned
decision
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Deronda
,
in
a
mournful
suspense
which
made
him
reluctant
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
His
face
will
not
be
seen
above
the
water
again
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
in
a
tone
that
was
not
louder
,
but
of
a
suppressed
eagerness
,
while
she
held
both
her
hands
clenched
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
"
Not
by
any
one
else
 
only
by
me
 
a
dead
face
 
I
shall
never
get
away
from
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
with
an
inward
voice
of
desperate
self
-
repression
that
she
spoke
these
last
words
,
while
she
looked
away
from
Deronda
toward
something
at
a
distance
from
her
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
She
was
seeing
the
whole
event
 
<EOS>
her
own
acts
included
 
through
an
exaggerating
medium
of
excitement
and
horror
?
<EOS>
Was
she
in
a
state
of
delirium
into
which
there
entered
a
sense
of
concealment
and
necessity
for
self
-
repression
?
<EOS>
Such
thoughts
glanced
through
Deronda
as
a
sort
of
hope
.
<EOS>
But
imagine
the
conflict
of
feeling
that
kept
him
silent
.
<EOS>
She
was
bent
on
confession
,
and
he
dreaded
hearing
her
confession
.
<EOS>
Against
his
better
will
he
shrank
from
the
task
that
was
laid
on
him
:
he
wished
,
and
yet
rebuked
the
wish
as
cowardly
,
that
she
could
bury
her
secrets
in
her
own
bosom
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
a
priest
.
<EOS>
He
dreaded
the
weight
of
this
woman
's
soul
flung
upon
his
own
with
imploring
dependence
.
<EOS>
But
she
spoke
again
,
hurriedly
,
looking
at
him
    
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
say
that
I
ought
to
tell
the
world
?
<EOS>
you
will
not
say
that
I
ought
to
be
disgraced
?
<EOS>
I
could
not
do
it
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
it
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
have
my
mother
know
.
<EOS>
Not
if
I
were
dead
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
have
her
know
.
<EOS>
I
must
tell
you
;
but
you
will
not
say
that
any
one
else
should
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
say
nothing
in
my
ignorance
,
"
said
Deronda
,
mournfully
,
"
except
that
I
desire
to
help
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
from
the
beginning
 
as
soon
as
I
could
 
<EOS>
I
told
you
I
was
afraid
of
myself
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
piteous
pleading
in
the
low
murmur
in
which
Deronda
turned
his
ear
only
.
<EOS>
Her
face
afflicted
him
too
much
.
<EOS>
"
I
felt
a
hatred
in
me
that
was
always
working
like
an
evil
spirit
 
contriving
things
.
<EOS>
Everything
I
could
do
to
free
myself
came
into
my
mind
;
and
it
got
worse
 
<EOS>
all
things
got
worse
.
<EOS>
That
is
why
I
asked
you
to
come
to
me
in
town
.
<EOS>
I
thought
then
I
would
tell
you
the
worst
about
myself
.
<EOS>
I
tried
.
<EOS>
But
I
could
not
tell
everything
.
<EOS>
And
_
he
_
came
in
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
paused
,
while
a
shudder
passed
through
her
;
but
soon
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
everything
now
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
a
woman
who
cried
,
and
prayed
,
and
struggled
to
be
saved
from
herself
,
could
be
a
murderess
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Great
God
!
"
said
Deronda
,
in
a
deep
,
shaken
voice
,
"
do
n't
torture
me
needlessly
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
murdered
him
.
<EOS>
You
threw
yourself
into
the
water
with
the
impulse
to
save
him
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
the
rest
afterward
.
<EOS>
This
death
was
an
accident
that
you
could
not
have
hindered
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
be
impatient
with
me
.
"
<EOS>
The
tremor
,
the
childlike
beseeching
in
these
words
compelled
Deronda
to
turn
his
head
and
look
at
her
face
.
<EOS>
The
poor
quivering
lips
went
on
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
said
 
you
used
to
say
 
you
felt
more
for
those
who
had
done
something
wicked
and
were
miserable
;
you
said
they
might
get
better
 
<EOS>
they
might
be
scourged
into
something
better
.
<EOS>
If
you
had
not
spoken
in
that
way
,
Everything
would
have
been
worse
.
<EOS>
I
_
did
_
remember
all
you
said
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
came
to
me
always
.
<EOS>
It
came
to
me
at
the
very
last
 
<EOS>
that
was
the
reason
why
I
 
<EOS>
But
now
,
if
you
can
not
bear
with
me
when
I
tell
you
everything
 
if
you
turn
away
from
me
and
forsake
me
,
what
shall
I
do
?
<EOS>
Am
I
worse
than
I
was
when
you
found
me
and
wanted
to
make
me
better
?
<EOS>
All
the
wrong
I
have
done
was
in
me
then
 
and
more
 
and
more
 
if
you
had
not
come
and
been
patient
with
me
.
<EOS>
And
now
 
will
you
forsake
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
Her
hands
,
which
had
been
so
tightly
clenched
some
minutes
before
,
were
now
helplessly
relaxed
and
trembling
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
.
<EOS>
Her
quivering
lips
remained
parted
as
she
ceased
speaking
.
<EOS>
Deronda
could
not
answer
;
he
was
obliged
to
look
away
.
<EOS>
He
took
one
of
her
hands
,
and
clasped
it
as
if
they
were
going
to
walk
together
like
two
children
:
it
was
the
only
way
in
which
he
could
answer
,
"
I
will
not
forsake
you
.
"
<EOS>
And
all
the
while
he
felt
as
if
he
were
putting
his
name
to
a
blank
paper
which
might
be
filled
up
terribly
.
<EOS>
Their
attitude
,
his
adverted
face
with
its
expression
of
a
suffering
which
he
was
solemnly
resolved
to
undergo
,
might
have
told
half
the
truth
of
the
situation
to
a
beholder
who
had
suddenly
entered
.
  
<EOS>
That
grasp
was
an
entirely
new
experience
to
Gwendolen
:
she
had
never
before
had
from
any
man
a
sign
of
tenderness
which
her
own
being
had
needed
,
and
she
interpreted
its
powerful
effect
on
her
into
a
promise
of
inexhaustible
patience
and
constancy
.
<EOS>
The
stream
of
renewed
strength
made
it
possible
for
her
to
go
on
as
she
had
begun
 
with
that
fitful
,
wandering
confession
where
the
sameness
of
experience
seems
to
nullify
the
sense
of
time
or
of
order
in
events
.
<EOS>
She
began
again
in
a
fragmentary
way
    
<EOS>
"
All
sorts
of
contrivances
in
my
mind
 
but
all
so
difficult
.
<EOS>
And
I
fought
against
them
 
<EOS>
I
was
terrified
at
them
 
<EOS>
I
saw
his
dead
face
"
 
<EOS>
here
her
voice
sank
almost
to
a
whisper
close
to
Deronda
's
ear
 
"
<EOS>
ever
so
long
ago
I
saw
it
<EOS>
and
I
wished
him
to
be
dead
.
<EOS>
And
yet
it
terrified
me
.
<EOS>
I
was
like
two
creatures
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
speak
 
<EOS>
I
wanted
to
kill
 
<EOS>
it
was
as
strong
as
thirst
 
<EOS>
and
then
directly
 
I
felt
beforehand
<EOS>
I
had
done
something
dreadful
,
unalterable
 
<EOS>
that
would
make
me
like
an
evil
spirit
.
<EOS>
And
it
came
 
it
came
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
silent
a
moment
or
two
,
as
if
her
memory
had
lost
itself
in
a
web
where
each
mesh
drew
all
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
had
all
been
in
my
mind
when
I
first
spoke
to
you
 
when
we
were
at
the
Abbey
.
<EOS>
I
had
done
something
then
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
tell
you
that
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
only
thing
I
did
toward
carrying
out
my
thoughts
.
<EOS>
They
went
about
over
everything
;
but
they
all
remained
like
dreadful
dreams
 
all
but
one
.
<EOS>
I
did
one
act
 
<EOS>
and
I
never
undid
it
 
<EOS>
it
is
there
still
 
as
long
ago
as
when
we
were
at
Ryelands
.
<EOS>
There
it
was
 
something
my
fingers
longed
for
among
the
beautiful
toys
in
the
cabinet
in
my
boudoir
 
small
and
sharp
like
a
long
willow
leaf
in
a
silver
sheath
.
<EOS>
I
locked
it
in
the
drawer
of
my
dressing
-
case
.
<EOS>
I
was
continually
haunted
with
it
and
how
I
should
use
it
.
<EOS>
I
fancied
myself
putting
it
under
my
pillow
.
<EOS>
But
I
never
did
.
<EOS>
I
never
looked
at
it
again
.
<EOS>
I
dared
not
unlock
the
drawer
:
it
had
a
key
all
to
itself
;
and
not
long
ago
,
when
we
were
in
the
yacht
,
I
dropped
the
key
into
the
deep
water
.
<EOS>
It
was
my
wish
to
drop
it
and
deliver
myself
.
<EOS>
After
that
I
began
to
think
how
I
could
open
the
drawer
without
the
key
:
and
when
I
found
we
were
to
stay
at
Genoa
,
it
came
into
my
mind
that
I
could
get
it
opened
privately
at
the
hotel
.
<EOS>
But
then
,
when
we
were
going
up
the
stairs
,
I
met
you
;
and
I
thought
I
should
talk
to
you
alone
and
tell
you
this
 
everything
I
could
not
tell
you
in
town
;
and
then
I
was
forced
to
go
out
in
the
boat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
A
sob
had
for
the
first
time
risen
with
the
last
words
,
and
she
sank
back
in
her
chair
.
<EOS>
The
memory
of
that
acute
disappointment
seemed
for
the
moment
to
efface
what
had
come
since
.
<EOS>
Deronda
did
not
look
at
her
,
but
he
said
,
insistently
    
"
<EOS>
And
it
has
all
remained
in
your
imagination
.
<EOS>
It
has
gone
on
only
in
your
thought
.
<EOS>
To
the
last
the
evil
temptation
has
been
resisted
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
silence
.
<EOS>
The
tears
had
rolled
down
her
cheeks
.
<EOS>
She
pressed
her
handkerchief
against
them
and
sat
upright
.
<EOS>
She
was
summoning
her
resolution
;
and
again
,
leaning
a
little
toward
Deronda
's
ear
<EOS>
,
she
began
in
a
whisper
    
"
No
,
no
;
I
will
tell
you
everything
as
God
knows
it
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
no
falsehood
;
I
will
tell
you
the
exact
truth
.
<EOS>
What
should
I
do
else
?
<EOS>
I
used
to
think
I
could
never
be
wicked
.
<EOS>
I
thought
of
wicked
people
as
if
they
were
a
long
way
off
me
.
<EOS>
Since
then
I
have
been
wicked
.
<EOS>
I
have
felt
wicked
.
<EOS>
And
everything
has
been
a
punishment
to
me
 
all
the
things
I
used
to
wish
for
 
<EOS>
it
is
as
if
they
had
been
made
red
-
hot
.
<EOS>
The
very
daylight
has
often
been
a
punishment
to
me
.
<EOS>
Because
 
you
know
 
<EOS>
I
ought
not
to
have
married
.
<EOS>
That
was
the
beginning
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
wronged
some
one
else
.
<EOS>
I
broke
my
promise
.
<EOS>
I
meant
to
get
pleasure
for
myself
,
and
it
all
turned
to
misery
.
<EOS>
I
wanted
to
make
my
gain
out
of
another
's
loss
 
you
remember
?
 
<EOS>
it
was
like
roulette
 
and
the
money
burned
into
me
.
<EOS>
And
I
could
not
complain
.
<EOS>
It
was
as
if
I
had
prayed
that
another
should
lose
and
I
should
win
.
<EOS>
And
I
had
won
,
I
knew
it
all
 
<EOS>
I
knew
I
was
guilty
.
<EOS>
When
we
were
on
the
sea
,
and
I
lay
awake
at
night
in
the
cabin
,
I
sometimes
felt
that
everything
I
had
done
lay
open
without
excuse
 
<EOS>
nothing
was
hidden
 
<EOS>
how
could
anything
be
known
to
me
only
?
 
<EOS>
it
was
not
my
own
knowledge
,
it
was
God
's
that
had
entered
into
me
,
and
even
the
stillness
 
<EOS>
everything
held
a
punishment
for
me
 
everything
<EOS>
but
you
.
<EOS>
I
always
thought
that
you
would
not
want
me
to
be
punished
 
you
would
have
tried
and
helped
me
to
be
better
.
<EOS>
And
only
thinking
of
that
helped
me
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
change
 
<EOS>
you
will
not
want
to
punish
me
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Again
a
sob
had
risen
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
forbid
!
"
<EOS>
groaned
Deronda
.
<EOS>
But
he
sat
motionless
.
  
<EOS>
This
long
wandering
with
the
conscious
-
stricken
one
over
her
past
was
difficult
to
bear
,
but
he
dared
not
again
urge
her
with
a
question
.
<EOS>
He
must
let
her
mind
follow
its
own
need
.
<EOS>
She
unconsciously
left
intervals
in
her
retrospect
,
not
clearly
distinguishing
between
what
she
said
and
what
she
had
only
an
inward
vision
of
.
<EOS>
Her
next
words
came
after
such
an
interval
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
all
made
it
so
hard
when
I
was
forced
to
go
in
the
boat
.
<EOS>
Because
when
I
saw
you
it
was
an
unexpected
joy
,
and
I
thought
I
could
tell
you
everything
 
about
the
locked
-
up
drawer
and
what
I
had
not
told
you
before
.
<EOS>
And
if
I
had
told
you
,
and
knew
it
was
in
your
mind
,
it
would
have
less
power
over
me
.
<EOS>
I
hoped
and
trusted
in
that
.
<EOS>
For
after
all
my
struggles
and
my
crying
,
the
hatred
and
rage
,
the
temptation
that
frightened
me
,
the
longing
,
the
thirst
for
what
I
dreaded
,
always
came
back
.
<EOS>
And
that
disappointment
 
when
I
was
quite
shut
out
from
speaking
to
you
,
and
was
driven
to
go
in
the
boat
 
brought
all
the
evil
back
,
as
if
I
had
been
locked
in
a
prison
with
it
and
no
escape
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
it
seems
so
long
ago
now
since
I
stepped
into
that
boat
!
<EOS>
I
could
have
given
up
everything
in
that
moment
,
to
have
the
forked
lightning
for
a
weapon
to
strike
him
dead
.
"
  
<EOS>
Some
of
the
compressed
fierceness
that
she
was
recalling
seemed
to
find
its
way
into
her
undertoned
utterance
.
<EOS>
After
a
little
silence
she
said
,
with
agitated
hurry
    
<EOS>
"
If
he
were
here
again
,
what
should
I
do
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
wish
him
here
 
<EOS>
and
yet
I
can
not
bear
his
dead
face
.
<EOS>
I
was
a
coward
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
borne
contempt
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
gone
away
 
gone
and
wandered
like
a
beggar
rather
than
to
stay
to
feel
like
a
fiend
.
<EOS>
But
turn
where
I
would
there
was
something
I
could
not
bear
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
I
thought
he
would
kill
_
me
_
if
I
resisted
his
will
.
<EOS>
But
now
 
his
dead
face
is
there
,
and
I
can
not
bear
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Suddenly
loosing
Deronda
's
hand
,
she
started
up
,
stretching
her
arms
to
their
full
length
upward
,
and
said
with
a
sort
of
moan
    
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
a
cruel
woman
!
<EOS>
What
can
_
<EOS>
I
_
do
but
cry
for
help
?
<EOS>
_
I
_
am
sinking
.
<EOS>
Die
 
die
 
<EOS>
you
are
forsaken
 
<EOS>
go
down
,
go
down
into
darkness
.
<EOS>
Forsaken
 
no
pity
 
<EOS>
_
I
_
shall
be
forsaken
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
sank
in
her
chair
again
and
broke
into
sobs
.
<EOS>
Even
Deronda
had
no
place
in
her
consciousness
at
that
moment
.
<EOS>
He
was
completely
unmanned
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
finding
,
as
he
had
imagined
,
that
his
late
experience
had
dulled
his
susceptibility
to
fresh
emotion
,
it
seemed
that
the
lot
of
this
young
creature
,
whose
swift
travel
from
her
bright
rash
girlhood
into
this
agony
of
remorse
he
had
had
to
behold
in
helplessness
,
pierced
him
the
deeper
because
it
came
close
upon
another
sad
revelation
of
spiritual
conflict
:
he
was
in
one
of
those
moments
when
the
very
anguish
of
passionate
pity
makes
us
ready
to
choose
that
we
will
know
pleasure
no
more
,
and
live
only
for
the
stricken
and
afflicted
.
<EOS>
He
had
risen
from
his
seat
while
he
watched
that
terrible
outburst
 
<EOS>
which
seemed
the
more
awful
to
him
because
,
even
in
this
supreme
agitation
,
she
kept
the
suppressed
voice
of
one
who
confesses
in
secret
.
<EOS>
At
last
he
felt
impelled
to
turn
his
back
toward
her
and
walk
to
a
distance
.
  
<EOS>
But
presently
there
was
stillness
.
<EOS>
Her
mind
had
opened
to
the
sense
that
he
had
gone
away
from
her
.
<EOS>
When
Deronda
turned
round
to
approach
her
again
,
he
saw
her
face
bent
toward
him
,
her
eyes
dilated
,
her
lips
parted
.
<EOS>
She
was
an
image
of
timid
forlorn
beseeching
 
too
timid
to
entreat
in
words
while
he
kept
himself
aloof
from
her
.
<EOS>
Was
she
forsaken
by
him
 
now
 
already
?
<EOS>
But
his
eyes
met
hers
<EOS>
sorrowfully
 
met
hers
for
the
first
time
fully
since
she
had
said
,
"
You
know
I
am
a
guilty
woman
,
"
and
that
full
glance
in
its
intense
mournfulness
seemed
to
say
,
"
I
know
it
,
but
I
shall
all
the
less
forsake
you
.
"
<EOS>
He
sat
down
by
her
side
again
in
the
same
attitude
 
without
turning
his
face
toward
her
and
without
again
taking
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
Once
more
Gwendolen
was
pierced
,
as
she
had
been
by
his
face
of
sorrow
at
the
Abbey
,
with
a
compunction
less
egoistic
than
that
which
urged
her
to
confess
,
and
she
said
,
in
a
tone
of
loving
regret
    
<EOS>
"
I
make
you
very
unhappy
.
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
gave
an
indistinct
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
"
just
shrinking
together
and
changing
his
attitude
a
little
.
<EOS>
Then
he
had
gathered
resolution
enough
to
say
clearly
,
"
There
is
no
question
of
being
happy
or
unhappy
.
<EOS>
What
I
most
desire
at
this
moment
is
what
will
most
help
you
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
all
you
feel
it
<EOS>
a
relief
to
tell
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Devoted
as
these
words
were
,
they
widened
his
spiritual
distance
from
her
,
and
she
felt
it
more
difficult
to
speak
:
she
had
a
vague
need
of
getting
nearer
to
that
compassion
which
seemed
to
be
regarding
her
from
a
halo
of
superiority
,
and
the
need
turned
into
an
impulse
to
humble
herself
more
.
<EOS>
She
was
ready
to
throw
herself
on
her
knees
before
him
;
but
no
 
her
wonderfully
mixed
consciousness
held
checks
on
that
impulse
,
and
she
was
kept
silent
and
motionless
by
the
pressure
of
opposing
needs
.
<EOS>
Her
stillness
made
Deronda
at
last
<EOS>
say
    
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
are
too
weary
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
go
away
,
and
come
again
whenever
you
wish
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
Gwendolen
 
<EOS>
the
dread
of
his
leaving
her
bringing
back
her
power
of
speech
.
<EOS>
She
went
on
with
her
low
-
toned
eagerness
,
"
I
want
to
tell
you
what
it
was
that
came
over
me
in
that
boat
.
<EOS>
I
was
full
of
rage
at
being
obliged
to
go
 
full
of
rage
 
and
I
could
do
nothing
but
sit
there
like
a
galley
slave
.
<EOS>
And
then
we
got
away
 
out
of
the
port
 
into
the
deep
 
and
everything
was
still
 
<EOS>
and
we
never
looked
at
each
other
,
only
he
spoke
to
order
me
 
and
the
very
light
about
me
<EOS>
seemed
to
hold
me
a
prisoner
and
force
me
to
sit
as
I
did
.
<EOS>
It
came
over
me
that
when
I
was
a
child
I
used
to
fancy
sailing
away
into
a
world
where
people
were
not
forced
to
live
with
any
one
they
did
not
like
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
like
my
father
-
in
-
law
to
come
home
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
I
thought
,
just
the
opposite
had
come
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
stepped
into
a
boat
,
and
my
life
was
a
sailing
and
sailing
away
 
gliding
on
and
no
help
 
always
into
solitude
with
_
him
_
,
away
from
deliverance
.
<EOS>
And
because
I
felt
more
helpless
than
ever
,
my
thoughts
went
out
over
worse
things
 
<EOS>
I
longed
for
worse
things
 
<EOS>
I
had
cruel
wishes
 
<EOS>
I
fancied
impossible
ways
of
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
want
to
die
myself
;
I
was
afraid
of
our
being
drowned
together
.
<EOS>
If
it
had
been
any
use
I
should
have
prayed
 
I
should
have
prayed
that
something
might
befall
him
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
prayed
that
he
might
sink
out
of
my
sight
and
leave
me
alone
.
<EOS>
I
knew
no
way
of
killing
him
there
,
but
I
did
,
I
did
kill
him
in
my
thoughts
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
sank
into
silence
for
a
minute
,
submerged
by
the
weight
of
memory
which
no
words
could
represent
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
yet
,
all
the
while
I
felt
that
I
was
getting
more
wicked
.
<EOS>
And
what
had
been
with
me
so
much
,
came
to
me
just
then
 
what
you
once
said
 
about
dreading
to
increase
my
wrong
-
doing
and
<EOS>
my
remorse
 
<EOS>
I
should
hope
for
nothing
then
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
like
a
writing
of
fire
within
me
.
<EOS>
Getting
wicked
was
misery
 
being
shut
out
forever
from
knowing
what
you
 
<EOS>
what
better
lives
were
.
<EOS>
That
had
always
been
coming
back
to
me
then
 
<EOS>
but
yet
with
a
despair
 
a
feeling
that
it
was
no
use
 
<EOS>
evil
wishes
were
too
strong
.
<EOS>
I
remember
then
letting
go
the
tiller
and
saying
"
God
help
me
!
"
<EOS>
But
then
I
was
forced
to
take
it
again
and
go
on
;
and
the
evil
longings
,
the
evil
prayers
came
again
and
blotted
everything
else
dim
,
till
,
in
the
midst
of
them
 
I
do
n't
know
how
it
was
 
<EOS>
he
was
turning
the
sail
 
<EOS>
there
was
a
gust
 
<EOS>
he
was
struck
 
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
 
<EOS>
I
only
know
that
I
saw
my
wish
outside
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
began
to
speak
more
hurriedly
,
and
in
more
of
a
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
saw
him
sink
,
and
my
heart
gave
a
leap
as
if
it
were
going
out
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
did
not
move
.
<EOS>
I
kept
my
hands
tight
.
<EOS>
It
was
long
enough
for
me
to
be
glad
,
and
yet
to
think
it
was
no
use
 
he
would
come
up
again
.
<EOS>
And
he
_
was
_
<EOS>
come
 
farther
off
 
<EOS>
the
boat
had
moved
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
like
lightning
.
"
<EOS>
The
rope
!
"
<EOS>
he
called
out
in
a
voice
 
<EOS>
not
his
own
 
<EOS>
I
hear
it
now
 
<EOS>
and
I
stooped
for
the
rope
 
<EOS>
I
felt
I
must
 
<EOS>
I
felt
sure
he
could
swim
,
and
he
would
come
back
whether
or
not
,
and
I
dreaded
him
.
<EOS>
That
was
in
my
mind
 
<EOS>
he
would
come
back
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
gone
down
again
,
and
I
had
the
rope
in
my
hand
 
<EOS>
no
,
there
he
was
again
 
<EOS>
his
face
above
the
water
 
<EOS>
and
he
cried
again
 
<EOS>
and
I
held
my
hand
,
and
my
heart
said
,
"
Die
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
he
sank
;
<EOS>
and
I
felt
'
It
is
done
 
<EOS>
I
am
wicked
,
I
am
lost
!
 
<EOS>
and
I
had
the
rope
in
my
hand
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
I
thought
 
<EOS>
I
was
leaping
away
from
myself
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
saved
him
then
.
<EOS>
I
was
leaping
from
my
crime
,
and
there
it
was
 
close
to
me
as
I
fell
 
<EOS>
there
was
the
dead
face
 
dead
,
dead
.
<EOS>
It
can
never
be
altered
.
<EOS>
That
was
what
happened
.
<EOS>
That
was
what
I
did
.
<EOS>
You
know
it
all
.
<EOS>
It
can
never
be
altered
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
sank
back
in
her
chair
,
exhausted
with
the
agitation
of
memory
and
speech
.
<EOS>
Deronda
felt
the
burden
on
his
spirit
less
heavy
than
the
foregoing
dread
.
<EOS>
The
word
"
guilty
"
had
held
a
possibility
of
interpretations
worse
than
the
fact
;
and
Gwendolen
's
confession
,
for
the
very
reason
that
her
conscience
made
her
dwell
on
the
determining
power
of
her
evil
thoughts
,
convinced
him
the
more
that
there
had
been
throughout
a
counterbalancing
struggle
of
her
better
will
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
almost
certain
that
her
murderous
thought
had
had
no
outward
effect
 
that
,
quite
apart
from
it
,
the
death
was
inevitable
.
<EOS>
Still
,
a
question
as
to
the
outward
effectiveness
of
a
criminal
desire
dominant
enough
to
impel
even
a
momentary
act
,
can
not
alter
our
judgment
of
the
desire
;
and
Deronda
shrank
from
putting
that
question
forward
in
the
first
instance
.
<EOS>
He
held
it
likely
that
Gwendolen
's
remorse
aggravated
her
inward
guilt
,
and
that
she
gave
the
character
of
decisive
action
to
what
had
been
an
inappreciably
instantaneous
glance
of
desire
.
<EOS>
But
her
remorse
was
the
precious
sign
of
a
recoverable
nature
;
it
was
the
culmination
of
that
self
-
disapproval
which
had
been
the
awakening
of
a
new
life
within
her
;
it
marked
her
off
from
the
criminals
whose
only
regret
is
failure
in
securing
their
evil
wish
.
<EOS>
Deronda
could
not
utter
one
word
to
diminish
that
sacred
aversion
to
her
worst
self
 
<EOS>
that
thorn
-
pressure
which
must
come
with
the
crowning
of
the
sorrowful
better
,
suffering
because
of
the
worse
.
<EOS>
All
this
mingled
thought
and
feeling
kept
him
silent
;
speech
was
too
momentous
to
be
ventured
on
rashly
.
<EOS>
There
were
no
words
of
comfort
that
did
not
carry
some
sacrilege
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
opened
his
lips
to
speak
,
he
could
only
have
echoed
,
"
It
can
never
be
altered
 
<EOS>
it
remains
unaltered
,
to
alter
other
things
.
<EOS>
"
But
he
was
silent
and
motionless
 
<EOS>
he
did
not
know
how
long
 
before
he
turned
to
look
at
her
,
and
saw
her
sunk
back
with
closed
eyes
,
like
a
lost
,
weary
,
storm
-
beaten
white
doe
,
unable
to
rise
and
pursue
its
unguided
way
.
<EOS>
He
rose
and
stood
before
her
.
<EOS>
The
movement
touched
her
consciousness
,
and
she
opened
her
eyes
with
a
slight
quivering
that
seemed
like
fear
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
rest
now
.
<EOS>
Try
to
rest
:
try
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
And
may
I
see
you
again
this
evening
 
to
-
morrow
 
<EOS>
when
you
have
had
some
rest
?
<EOS>
Let
us
say
no
more
now
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
tears
came
,
and
she
could
not
answer
except
by
a
slight
movement
of
the
head
.
<EOS>
Deronda
rang
for
attendance
,
spoke
urgently
of
the
necessity
that
she
should
be
got
to
rest
,
and
then
left
her
.
        
<EOS>
"
The
unripe
grape
,
the
ripe
,
and
the
dried
.
<EOS>
All
things
are
changes
,
    
not
into
nothing
,
but
into
that
which
is
not
at
present
.
"
 
<EOS>
MARCUS
    
AURELIUS
.
      
<EOS>
Deeds
are
the
pulse
of
Time
,
his
beating
life
,
    
And
righteous
or
unrighteous
,
being
done
,
    
<EOS>
Must
throb
in
after
-
throbs
till
Time
itself
    
Be
laid
in
darkness
,
and
the
universe
    
Quiver
and
breathe
upon
no
mirror
more
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
evening
she
sent
for
him
again
.
<EOS>
It
was
already
near
the
hour
at
which
she
had
been
brought
in
from
the
sea
the
evening
before
,
and
the
light
was
subdued
enough
with
blinds
drawn
up
and
windows
open
.
<EOS>
She
was
seated
gazing
fixedly
on
the
sea
,
resting
her
cheek
on
her
hand
,
looking
less
shattered
than
when
he
had
left
her
,
but
with
a
deep
melancholy
in
her
expression
which
as
Deronda
approached
her
passed
into
an
anxious
timidity
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
put
out
her
hand
,
but
said
,
"
How
long
ago
it
is
!
"
<EOS>
Then
,
"
Will
you
sit
near
me
again
a
little
while
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
placed
himself
by
her
side
as
he
had
done
before
,
and
seeing
that
she
turned
to
him
with
that
indefinable
expression
which
implies
a
wish
to
say
something
,
he
waited
for
her
to
speak
.
<EOS>
But
again
she
looked
toward
the
window
silently
,
and
again
turned
with
the
same
expression
,
which
yet
did
not
issue
in
speech
.
<EOS>
There
was
some
fear
hindering
her
,
and
Deronda
,
wishing
to
relieve
her
timidity
,
averted
his
face
.
<EOS>
Presently
he
heard
her
cry
imploringly
    
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
say
that
any
one
else
should
know
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Most
decidedly
not
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
action
that
ought
to
be
taken
in
consequence
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
injury
that
could
be
righted
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
retribution
that
any
mortal
could
apportion
justly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
so
still
during
a
pause
that
she
seemed
to
be
holding
her
breath
before
she
said
    
<EOS>
"
But
if
I
had
not
had
that
murderous
will
 
<EOS>
that
moment
 
<EOS>
if
I
had
thrown
the
rope
on
the
instant
 
perhaps
it
would
have
hindered
death
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
 
I
think
not
,
"
said
Deronda
,
slowly
.
<EOS>
"
If
it
were
true
that
he
could
swim
,
he
must
have
been
seized
with
cramp
.
<EOS>
With
your
quickest
,
utmost
effort
,
it
seems
impossible
that
you
could
have
done
anything
to
save
him
.
<EOS>
That
momentary
murderous
will
can
not
,
I
think
,
have
altered
the
course
of
events
.
<EOS>
Its
effect
is
confined
to
the
motives
in
your
own
breast
.
<EOS>
Within
ourselves
our
evil
will
is
momentous
,
and
sooner
or
later
it
works
its
way
outside
us
 
<EOS>
it
may
be
in
the
vitiation
that
breeds
evil
acts
,
but
also
it
may
be
in
the
self
-
abhorrence
that
stings
us
into
better
striving
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
saved
from
robbing
others
 
there
are
others
 
they
will
have
everything
 
they
will
have
what
they
ought
to
have
.
<EOS>
I
knew
that
some
time
before
I
left
town
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
suspect
me
of
wrong
desires
about
those
things
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
spoke
hesitatingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
not
thought
of
them
,
"
said
Deronda
;
"
I
was
thinking
too
much
of
the
other
things
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
do
n't
quite
know
the
beginning
of
it
all
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
slowly
,
as
if
she
were
overcoming
her
reluctance
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
some
one
else
he
ought
to
have
married
.
<EOS>
And
I
knew
it
,
and
I
told
her
I
would
not
hinder
it
.
<EOS>
And
I
went
away
 
<EOS>
that
was
when
you
first
saw
me
.
<EOS>
But
then
we
became
poor
all
at
once
,
and
I
was
very
miserable
,
and
I
was
tempted
.
<EOS>
I
thought
,
"
I
shall
do
as
I
like
and
make
everything
right
.
<EOS>
"
I
persuaded
myself
.
<EOS>
And
it
was
all
different
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
dreadful
.
<EOS>
Then
came
hatred
and
wicked
thoughts
.
<EOS>
That
was
how
it
all
came
.
<EOS>
I
told
you
I
was
afraid
of
myself
.
<EOS>
And
I
did
what
you
told
me
 
I
did
try
to
make
my
fear
a
safeguard
.
<EOS>
I
thought
of
what
would
be
if
I
 
<EOS>
I
felt
what
would
come
 
how
I
should
dread
the
morning
 
wishing
it
would
be
always
night
 
and
yet
in
the
darkness
always
seeing
something
 
seeing
death
.
<EOS>
If
you
did
not
know
how
miserable
I
was
,
you
might
 
<EOS>
but
now
it
has
all
been
no
use
.
<EOS>
I
can
care
for
nothing
but
saving
the
rest
from
knowing
 
poor
mamma
,
who
has
never
been
happy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
silence
again
before
she
said
with
a
repressed
sob
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
bear
to
look
at
me
any
more
.
<EOS>
You
think
I
am
too
wicked
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
believe
that
I
can
become
any
better
 
worth
anything
 
worthy
enough
 
<EOS>
I
shall
always
be
too
wicked
to
 
<EOS>
"
The
voice
broke
off
helpless
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
's
heart
was
pierced
.
<EOS>
He
turned
his
eyes
on
her
poor
beseeching
face
and
said
,
"
I
believe
that
you
may
become
worthier
than
you
have
ever
yet
been
 
worthy
to
lead
a
life
that
may
be
a
blessing
.
<EOS>
No
evil
dooms
us
hopelessly
except
the
evil
we
love
,
and
desire
to
continue
in
,
and
make
no
effort
to
escape
from
.
<EOS>
You
_
have
_
made
efforts
 
you
will
go
on
making
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
were
the
beginning
of
them
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
forsake
me
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
leaning
with
her
clasped
hands
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
and
looking
at
him
,
while
her
face
bore
piteous
traces
of
the
life
-
experience
concentrated
in
the
twenty
-
four
hours
 
that
new
terrible
life
lying
on
the
other
side
of
the
deed
which
fulfills
a
criminal
desire
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
bear
any
penance
.
<EOS>
I
will
lead
any
life
you
tell
me
.
<EOS>
But
you
must
not
forsake
me
.
<EOS>
You
must
be
near
.
<EOS>
If
you
had
been
near
me
 
if
I
could
have
said
everything
to
you
,
I
should
have
been
different
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
forsake
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
could
never
be
my
impulse
to
forsake
you
,
"
said
Deronda
promptly
,
with
that
voice
which
,
like
his
eyes
,
had
the
unintentional
effect
of
making
his
ready
sympathy
seem
more
personal
and
special
than
it
really
was
.
<EOS>
And
in
that
moment
he
was
not
himself
quite
free
from
a
foreboding
of
some
such
self
-
committing
effect
.
<EOS>
His
strong
feeling
for
this
stricken
creature
could
not
hinder
rushing
images
of
future
difficulty
.
<EOS>
He
continued
to
meet
her
appealing
eyes
as
he
spoke
,
but
it
was
with
the
painful
consciousness
that
to
her
ear
his
words
might
carry
a
promise
which
one
day
would
seem
unfulfilled
:
he
was
making
an
indefinite
promise
to
an
indefinite
hope
.
<EOS>
Anxieties
,
both
immediate
and
distant
,
crowded
on
his
thought
,
and
it
was
under
their
influence
that
,
after
a
moment
's
silence
,
he
said
    
"
I
expect
Sir
Hugo
Mallinger
to
arrive
by
to
-
morrow
night
at
least
;
and
I
am
not
without
hope
that
Mrs.
Davilow
may
shortly
follow
him
.
<EOS>
Her
presence
will
be
the
greatest
comfort
to
you
 
it
will
give
you
a
motive
to
save
her
from
unnecessary
pain
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
 
I
will
try
.
<EOS>
And
you
will
not
go
away
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
till
after
Sir
Hugo
has
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
we
shall
all
go
to
England
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
soon
as
possible
,
"
said
Deronda
,
not
wishing
to
enter
into
particulars
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
looked
toward
the
window
again
with
an
expression
which
seemed
like
a
gradual
awakening
to
new
thoughts
.
<EOS>
The
twilight
was
perceptibly
deepening
,
but
Deronda
could
see
a
movement
in
her
eyes
and
hands
such
as
accompanies
a
return
of
perception
in
one
who
has
been
stunned
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
always
be
with
Sir
Hugo
now
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
presently
,
looking
at
him
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
always
live
at
the
Abbey
 
or
else
at
Diplow
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
uncertain
where
I
shall
live
,
"
said
Deronda
,
coloring
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
warned
by
his
changed
color
that
she
had
spoken
too
rashly
,
and
fell
silent
.
<EOS>
After
a
little
while
she
began
,
again
looking
away
    
"
It
is
impossible
to
think
how
my
life
will
go
on
.
<EOS>
I
think
now
it
would
be
better
for
me
to
be
poor
and
obliged
to
work
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
New
promptings
will
come
as
the
days
pass
.
<EOS>
When
you
are
among
your
friends
again
,
you
will
discern
new
duties
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
Make
it
a
task
now
to
get
as
well
and
calm
 
as
much
like
yourself
as
you
can

hesitated

<EOS>
"
Before
my
mother
comes

said
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
must
be
changed
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
looked
at
myself
.
<EOS>
Should
you
have
known
me
,
"
she
added
,
turning
toward
him
,
"
if
you
had
met
me
now
?
 
<EOS>
should
you
have
known
me
for
the
one
you
saw
at
Leubronn
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
should
have
known
you
,
"
said
Deronda
,
mournfully
.
<EOS>
"
The
outside
change
is
not
great
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
seen
at
once
that
it
was
you
,
and
that
you
had
gone
through
some
great
sorrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
wish
now
that
you
had
never
seen
me
;
do
n't
wish
that
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
imploringly
,
while
the
tears
gathered
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
despise
myself
for
wishing
it
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
How
could
I
know
what
I
was
wishing
?
<EOS>
We
must
find
our
duties
in
what
comes
to
us
,
not
in
what
we
imagine
might
have
been
.
<EOS>
If
I
took
to
foolish
wishing
of
that
sort
,
I
should
wish
 
not
that
I
had
never
seen
you
,
but
that
I
had
been
able
to
save
you
from
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
saved
me
from
worse
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
in
a
sobbing
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
been
worse
if
it
had
not
been
for
you
.
<EOS>
If
you
had
not
been
good
,
I
should
have
been
more
wicked
than
I
am
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
better
for
me
to
go
now
,
"
said
Deronda
,
worn
in
spirit
by
the
perpetual
strain
of
this
scene
.
<EOS>
"
Remember
what
we
said
of
your
task
 
to
get
well
and
calm
before
other
friends
come
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
rose
as
he
spoke
,
and
she
gave
him
her
hand
submissively
.
<EOS>
But
when
he
had
left
her
she
sank
on
her
knees
,
in
hysterical
crying
.
<EOS>
The
distance
between
them
was
too
great
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
banished
soul
 
beholding
a
possible
life
which
she
had
sinned
herself
away
from
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
found
in
this
way
,
crushed
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
Such
grief
seemed
natural
in
a
poor
lady
whose
husband
had
been
drowned
in
her
presence

Extension
,
we
know
,
is
a
very
imperfect
measure
of
things
;
and
the
length
of
the
sun
's
journeying
can
no
more
tell
us
how
life
has
advanced
than
the
acreage
of
a
field
can
tell
us
what
growths
may
be
active
within
it
.
<EOS>
A
man
may
go
south
,
and
,
stumbling
over
a
bone
,
may
meditate
upon
it
till
he
has
found
a
new
starting
-
point
for
anatomy
;
or
eastward
,
and
discover
a
new
key
to
language
telling
a
new
story
of
races
;
or
he
may
head
an
expedition
that
opens
new
continental
pathways
,
get
himself
maimed
in
body
,
and
go
through
a
whole
heroic
poem
of
resolve
and
endurance
;
and
at
the
end
of
a
few
months
he
may
come
back
to
find
his
neighbors
grumbling
at
the
same
parish
grievance
as
before
,
or
to
see
the
same
elderly
gentleman
treading
the
pavement
in
discourse
with
himself
,
shaking
his
head
after
the
same
percussive
butcher
's
boy
,
and
pausing
at
the
same
shop
-
window
to
look
at
the
same
prints
.
<EOS>
If
the
swiftest
thinking
has
about
the
pace
of
a
greyhound
,
the
slowest
must
be
supposed
to
move
,
like
the
limpet
,
by
an
apparent
sticking
,
which
after
a
good
while
is
discerned
to
be
a
slight
progression
.
<EOS>
Such
differences
are
manifest
in
the
variable
intensity
which
we
call
human
experience
,
from
the
revolutionary
rush
of
change
which
makes
a
new
inner
and
outer
life
,
to
that
quiet
recurrence
of
the
familiar
,
which
has
no
other
epochs
than
those
of
hunger
and
the
heavens
.
  
<EOS>
Something
of
this
contrast
was
seen
in
the
year
's
experience
which
had
turned
the
brilliant
,
self
-
confident
Gwendolen
Harleth
of
the
Archery
Meeting
into
the
crushed
penitent
impelled
to
confess
her
unworthiness
where
it
would
have
been
her
happiness
to
be
held
worthy
;
while
it
had
left
her
family
in
Pennicote
without
deeper
change
than
that
of
some
outward
habits
,
and
some
adjustment
of
prospects
and
intentions
to
reduced
income
,
fewer
visits
,
and
fainter
compliments
.
<EOS>
The
rectory
was
as
pleasant
a
home
as
before
:
and
the
red
and
pink
peonies
on
the
lawn
,
the
rows
of
hollyhocks
by
the
hedges
,
had
bloomed
as
well
this
year
as
last
:
the
rector
maintained
his
cheerful
confidence
in
the
good
will
of
patrons
and
his
resolution
to
deserve
it
by
diligence
in
the
fulfillment
of
his
duties
,
whether
patrons
were
likely
to
hear
of
it
or
not
;
doing
nothing
solely
with
an
eye
to
promotion
except
,
perhaps
,
the
writing
of
two
ecclesiastical
articles
,
which
having
no
signature
,
were
attributed
to
some
one
else
,
except
by
the
patrons
who
had
a
special
copy
sent
them
,
and
these
certainly
knew
the
author
but
did
not
read
the
articles
.
<EOS>
The
rector
,
however
,
chewed
no
poisonous
cud
of
suspicion
on
this
point
:
he
made
marginal
notes
on
his
own
copies
to
render
them
a
more
interesting
loan
,
and
was
gratified
that
the
Archdeacon
and
other
authorities
had
nothing
to
say
against
the
general
tenor
of
his
argument
.
<EOS>
Peaceful
authorship
!
 
<EOS>
living
in
the
air
of
the
fields
and
downs
,
and
not
in
the
thrice
-
breathed
breath
of
criticism
 
bringing
no
Dantesque
leanness
;
rather
,
assisting
nutrition
by
complacency
,
and
perhaps
giving
a
more
suffusive
sense
of
achievement
than
the
production
of
a
whole
_
Divina
Commedia
_
.
<EOS>
Then
there
was
the
father
's
recovered
delight
in
his
favorite
son
,
which
was
a
happiness
outweighing
the
loss
of
eighteen
hundred
a
year
.
<EOS>
Of
whatever
nature
might
be
the
hidden
change
wrought
in
Rex
by
the
disappointment
of
his
first
love
,
it
was
apparently
quite
secondary
to
that
evidence
of
more
serious
ambition
which
dated
from
the
family
misfortune
;
indeed
,
Mr.
Gascoigne
was
inclined
to
regard
the
little
affair
which
had
caused
him
so
much
anxiety
the
year
before
as
an
evaporation
of
superfluous
moisture
,
a
kind
of
finish
to
the
baking
process
which
the
human
dough
demands
.
<EOS>
Rex
had
lately
come
down
for
a
summer
visit
to
the
rectory
,
bringing
Anna
home
,
and
while
he
showed
nearly
the
old
liveliness
with
his
brothers
and
sisters
,
he
continued
in
his
holiday
the
habits
of
the
eager
student
,
rising
early
in
the
morning
and
shutting
himself
up
early
in
the
evenings
to
carry
on
a
fixed
course
of
study
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
repent
the
choice
of
the
law
as
a
profession
,
Rex
?
"
said
his
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
profession
I
would
choose
before
it
,
"
said
Rex
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
end
my
life
as
a
first
-
rate
judge
,
and
help
to
draw
up
a
code
.
<EOS>
I
reverse
the
famous
dictum
.
<EOS>
I
should
say
,
"
Give
me
something
to
do
with
making
the
laws
,
and
let
who
will
make
the
songs
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
will
have
to
stow
in
an
immense
amount
of
rubbish
,
I
suppose
 
that
's
the
worst
of
it
,
"
said
the
rector
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
that
law
-
rubbish
is
worse
than
any
other
sort
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
so
bad
as
the
rubbishy
literature
that
people
choke
their
minds
with
.
<EOS>
It
does
n't
make
one
so
dull
.
<EOS>
Our
wittiest
men
have
often
been
lawyers
.
<EOS>
Any
orderly
way
of
looking
at
things
as
cases
and
evidence
seems
to
me
better
than
a
perpetual
wash
of
odds
and
ends
bearing
on
nothing
in
particular
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
from
a
higher
point
of
view
,
the
foundations
and
the
growth
of
law
make
the
most
interesting
aspects
of
philosophy
and
history
.
<EOS>
Of
course
there
will
be
a
good
deal
that
is
troublesome
,
drudging
,
perhaps
exasperating
.
<EOS>
But
the
great
prizes
in
life
ca
n't
be
won
easily
 
<EOS>
I
see
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
boy
,
the
best
augury
of
a
man
's
success
in
his
profession
is
that
he
thinks
it
the
finest
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
But
I
fancy
it
so
with
most
work
when
a
man
goes
into
it
with
a
will
.
<EOS>
Brewitt
,
the
blacksmith
,
said
to
me
the
other
day
that
his
'
prentice
had
no
mind
to
his
trade
;
'
and
yet
,
sir
,
"
said
Brewitt
,
"
what
would
a
young
fellow
have
if
he
does
n't
like
the
blacksmithing
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
rector
cherished
a
fatherly
delight
,
which
he
allowed
to
escape
him
only
in
moderation
.
<EOS>
Warham
,
who
had
gone
to
India
<EOS>
,
he
had
easily
borne
parting
with
,
but
Rex
was
that
romance
of
later
life
which
a
man
sometimes
finds
in
a
son
whom
he
recognizes
as
superior
to
himself
,
picturing
a
future
eminence
for
him
according
to
a
variety
of
famous
examples
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
to
his
wife
that
he
said
with
decision
:
"
Rex
will
be
a
distinguished
man
,
Nancy
,
I
am
sure
of
it
 
as
sure
as
Paley
's
father
was
about
his
son
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
Paley
an
old
bachelor
?
"
said
Mrs.
Gascoigne
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
hardly
to
the
point
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
rector
,
who
did
not
remember
that
irrelevant
detail
.
<EOS>
And
Mrs.
Gascoigne
felt
that
she
had
spoken
rather
weakly
.
  
<EOS>
This
quiet
trotting
of
time
at
the
rectory
was
shared
by
the
group
who
had
exchanged
the
faded
dignity
of
Offendene
for
the
low
white
house
not
a
mile
off
,
well
enclosed
with
evergreens
,
and
known
to
the
villagers
,
as
"
Jodson
's

<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
's
delicate
face
showed
only
a
slight
deepening
of
its
mild
melancholy
,
her
hair
only
a
few
more
silver
lines
,
in
consequence
of
the
last
year
's
trials
;
the
four
girls
had
bloomed
out
a
little
from
being
less
in
the
shade
;
and
the
good
Jocosa
preserved
her
serviceable
neutrality
toward
the
pleasures
and
glories
of
the
world
as
things
made
for
those
who
were
not
"
in
a
situation

The
low
narrow
drawing
-
room
,
enlarged
by
two
quaint
projecting
windows
,
with
lattices
wide
open
on
a
July
afternoon
to
the
scent
of
monthly
roses
,
the
faint
murmurs
of
the
garden
,
and
the
occasional
rare
sound
of
hoofs
and
wheels
seeming
to
clarify
the
succeeding
silence
,
made
rather
a
crowded
,
lively
scene
,
<EOS>
Rex
and
Anna
being
added
to
the
usual
group
of
six
.
<EOS>
Anna
,
always
a
favorite
with
her
younger
cousins
,
had
much
to
tell
of
her
new
experience
,
and
the
acquaintances
she
had
made
in
London
,
and
when
on
her
first
visit
she
came
alone
,
many
questions
were
asked
her
about
Gwendolen
's
house
in
Grosvenor
Square
,
what
Gwendolen
herself
had
said
,
and
what
any
one
else
had
said
about
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
Had
Anna
been
to
see
Gwendolen
after
she
had
known
about
the
yacht
?
<EOS>
No
:
 
an
answer
which
left
speculation
free
concerning
everything
connected
with
that
interesting
unknown
vessel
beyond
the
fact
that
Gwendolen
had
written
just
before
she
set
out
to
say
that
Mr.
Grandcourt
and
she
were
going
yachting
on
the
Mediterranean
,
and
again
from
Marseilles
to
say
that
she
was
sure
to
like
the
yachting
<EOS>
,
the
cabins
were
very
elegant
,
and
she
would
probably
not
send
another
letter
till
she
had
written
quite
a
long
diary
filled
with
_
dittos
_
.
<EOS>
Also
,
this
movement
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Grandcourt
had
been
mentioned
in
"
the
newspaper
;
"
so
that
altogether
this
new
phase
of
Gwendolen
's
exalted
life
made
a
striking
part
of
the
sisters
'
romance
,
the
book
-
devouring
Isabel
throwing
in
a
corsair
or
two
to
make
an
adventure
that
might
end
well
.
  
<EOS>
But
when
Rex
was
present
,
the
girls
,
according
to
instructions
,
never
started
this
fascinating
topic
,
and
to
-
day
there
had
only
been
animated
descriptions
of
the
Meyricks
and
their
extraordinary
Jewish
friends
,
which
caused
some
astonished
questioning
from
minds
to
which
the
idea
of
live
Jews
,
out
of
a
book
,
suggested
a
difference
deep
enough
to
be
almost
zoological
,
as
of
a
strange
race
in
Pliny
's
Natural
History
that
might
sleep
under
the
shade
of
its
own
ears
.
<EOS>
Bertha
could
not
imagine
what
Jews
believed
now
;
and
she
had
a
dim
idea
that
they
rejected
the
Old
Testament
since
it
proved
the
New
;
Miss
Merry
thought
that
Mirah
and
her
brother
could
"
never
have
been
properly
argued
with
,
"
and
the
amiable
Alice
did
not
mind
what
the
Jews
believed
,
she
was
sure
she
"
could
n't
bear
them
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
corrected
her
by
saying
that
the
great
Jewish
families
who
were
in
society
were
quite
what
they
ought
to
be
both
in
London
and
Paris
,
but
admitted
that
the
commoner
unconverted
Jews
were
objectionable
;
and
Isabel
asked
whether
Mirah
talked
just
as
they
did
,
or
whether
you
might
be
with
her
and
not
find
out
that
she
was
a
Jewess
.
  
<EOS>
Rex
,
who
had
no
partisanship
with
the
Israelites
,
having
made
a
troublesome
acquaintance
with
the
minutiae
of
their
ancient
history
in
the
form
of
"
cram
,
"
was
amusing
himself
by
playfully
exaggerating
the
notion
of
each
speaker
,
while
Anna
begged
them
all
to
understand
that
he
was
only
joking
,
when
the
laughter
was
interrupted
by
the
bringing
in
of
a
letter
for
Mrs.
Davilow
.
<EOS>
A
messenger
had
run
with
it
in
great
haste
from
the
rectory
.
<EOS>
It
enclosed
a
telegram
,
and
as
Mrs.
Davilow
read
and
re
-
read
it
in
silence
and
agitation
,
all
eyes
were
turned
on
her
with
anxiety
,
but
no
one
dared
to
speak
.
<EOS>
Looking
up
at
last
and
seeing
the
young
faces
"
painted
with
fear
,
"
she
remembered
that
they
might
be
imagining
something
worse
than
the
truth
,
something
like
her
own
first
dread
which
made
her
unable
to
understand
what
was
written
,
and
she
said
,
with
a
sob
which
was
half
relief
    
"
My
dears
,
Mr.
Grandcourt
 
<EOS>
"
She
paused
an
instant
,
and
then
began
again
,
"
Mr.
Grandcourt
is
drowned
.
"
  
<EOS>
Rex
started
up
as
if
a
missile
had
been
suddenly
thrown
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
help
himself
,
and
Anna
's
first
look
was
at
him
.
<EOS>
But
then
,
gathering
some
self
-
command
while
Mrs.
Davilow
was
reading
what
the
rector
had
written
on
the
enclosing
paper
,
he
said
    
"
Can
I
do
anything
,
aunt
?
<EOS>
Can
I
carry
any
word
to
my
father
from
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
dear
.
<EOS>
Tell
him
I
will
be
ready
 
<EOS>
he
is
very
good
.
<EOS>
He
says
he
will
go
with
me
to
Genoa
 
<EOS>
he
will
be
here
at
half
-
past
six
.
<EOS>
Jocosa
and
Alice
,
help
me
to
get
ready
.
<EOS>
She
is
safe
 
<EOS>
Gwendolen
is
safe
 
<EOS>
but
she
must
be
ill
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
she
must
be
very
ill
.
<EOS>
Rex
,
dear
 
Rex
and
Anna
 
go
and
and
tell
your
father
I
will
be
quite
ready
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
for
the
world
lose
another
night
.
<EOS>
And
bless
him
for
being
ready
so
soon
.
<EOS>
I
can
travel
night
and
day
till
we
get
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
Rex
and
Anna
hurried
away
through
the
sunshine
which
was
suddenly
solemn
to
them
,
without
uttering
a
word
to
each
other
:
she
chiefly
possessed
by
solicitude
about
any
reopening
of
his
wound
,
he
struggling
with
a
tumultuary
crowd
of
thoughts
that
were
an
offence
against
his
better
will
.
<EOS>
The
tumult
being
undiminished
when
they
were
at
the
rectory
gate
,
he
said
    
<EOS>
"
Nannie
,
I
will
leave
you
to
say
everything
to
my
father
.
<EOS>
If
he
wants
me
immediately
,
let
me
know
.
<EOS>
I
shall
stay
in
the
shrubbery
for
ten
minutes
 
only
ten
minutes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Who
has
been
quite
free
from
egoistic
escapes
of
the
imagination
,
picturing
desirable
consequences
on
his
own
future
in
the
presence
of
another
's
misfortune
,
sorrow
,
or
death
?
<EOS>
The
expected
promotion
or
legacy
is
the
common
type
of
a
temptation
which
makes
speech
and
even
prayer
a
severe
avoidance
of
the
most
insistent
thoughts
,
and
sometimes
raises
an
inward
shame
,
a
self
-
distaste
that
is
worse
than
any
other
form
of
unpleasant
companionship
.
<EOS>
In
Rex
's
nature
the
shame
was
immediate
,
and
overspread
like
an
ugly
light
all
the
hurrying
images
of
what
might
come
,
which
thrust
themselves
in
with
the
idea
that
Gwendolen
was
again
free
 
<EOS>
overspread
them
,
perhaps
,
the
more
persistently
because
every
phantasm
of
a
hope
was
quickly
nullified
by
a
more
substantial
obstacle
.
<EOS>
Before
the
vision
of
"
Gwendolen
free
"
rose
the
impassable
vision
of
"
Gwendolen
rich
,
exalted
,
courted
;
"
and
if
in
the
former
time
,
when
both
their
lives
were
fresh
,
she
had
turned
from
his
love
with
repugnance
,
what
ground
was
there
for
supposing
that
her
heart
would
be
more
open
to
him
in
the
future
?
  
<EOS>
These
thoughts
,
which
he
wanted
to
master
and
suspend
,
were
like
a
tumultuary
ringing
of
opposing
chimes
that
he
could
not
escape
from
by
running
.
<EOS>
During
the
last
year
he
had
brought
himself
into
a
state
of
calm
resolve
,
and
now
it
seemed
that
three
words
had
been
enough
to
undo
all
that
difficult
work
,
and
cast
him
back
into
the
wretched
fluctuations
of
a
longing
which
he
recognized
as
simply
perturbing
and
hopeless
.
<EOS>
And
at
this
moment
the
activity
of
such
longing
had
an
untimeliness
that
made
it
repulsive
to
his
better
self
.
<EOS>
Excuse
poor
Rex
;
it
was
not
much
more
than
eighteen
months
since
he
had
been
laid
low
by
an
archer
who
sometimes
touches
his
arrow
with
a
subtle
,
lingering
poison
.
<EOS>
The
disappointment
of
a
youthful
passion
has
effects
as
incalculable
as
those
of
small
-
pox
which
may
make
one
person
plain
and
a
genius
,
another
less
plain
and
more
foolish
,
another
plain
without
detriment
to
his
folly
,
and
leave
perhaps
the
majority
without
obvious
change
.
<EOS>
Everything
depends
 
not
on
the
mere
fact
of
disappointment
,
but
 
on
the
nature
affected
and
the
force
that
stirs
it
.
<EOS>
In
Rex
's
well
-
endowed
nature
,
brief
as
the
hope
had
been
,
the
passionate
stirring
had
gone
deep
,
and
the
effect
of
disappointment
was
revolutionary
,
though
fraught
with
a
beneficent
new
order
which
retained
most
of
the
old
virtues
;
in
certain
respects
he
believed
that
it
had
finally
determined
the
bias
and
color
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
Now
,
however
,
it
seemed
that
his
inward
peace
was
hardly
more
than
that
of
republican
Florence
,
and
his
heart
no
better
than
the
alarm
-
bell
that
made
work
slack
and
tumult
busy
.
  
<EOS>
Rex
's
love
had
been
of
that
sudden
,
penetrating
,
clinging
sort
which
the
ancients
knew
and
sung
,
and
in
singing
made
a
fashion
of
talk
for
many
moderns
whose
experience
has
by
no
means
a
fiery
,
demonic
character
.
<EOS>
To
have
the
consciousness
suddenly
steeped
with
another
's
personality
,
to
have
the
strongest
inclinations
possessed
by
an
image
which
retains
its
dominance
in
spite
of
change
and
apart
from
worthiness
 
nay
,
to
feel
a
passion
which
clings
faster
for
the
tragic
pangs
inflicted
by
a
cruel
,
reorganized
unworthiness
 
is
a
phase
of
love
which
in
the
feeble
and
common
-
minded
has
a
repulsive
likeness
to
his
blind
animalism
insensible
to
the
higher
sway
of
moral
affinity
or
heaven
-
lit
admiration
.
<EOS>
But
when
this
attaching
force
is
present
in
a
nature
not
of
brutish
unmodifiableness
,
but
of
a
human
dignity
that
can
risk
itself
safely
,
it
may
even
result
in
a
devotedness
not
unfit
to
be
called
divine
in
a
higher
sense
than
the
ancient
.
<EOS>
Phlegmatic
rationality
stares
and
shakes
its
head
at
these
unaccountable
prepossessions
,
but
they
exist
as
undeniably
as
the
winds
and
waves
,
determining
here
a
wreck
and
there
a
triumphant
voyage
.
  
<EOS>
This
sort
of
passion
had
nested
in
the
sweet
-
natured
,
strong
Rex
,
and
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
its
companionship
,
as
if
it
had
been
an
object
supremely
dear
,
stricken
dumb
and
helpless
,
and
turning
all
the
future
of
tenderness
into
a
shadow
of
the
past
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
also
made
up
his
mind
that
his
life
was
not
to
be
pauperized
because
he
had
had
to
renounce
one
sort
of
joy
;
rather
,
he
had
begun
life
again
with
a
new
counting
-
up
of
the
treasures
that
remained
to
him
,
and
he
had
even
felt
a
release
of
power
such
as
may
come
from
ceasing
to
be
afraid
of
your
own
neck
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
,
here
he
was
pacing
the
shrubbery
,
angry
with
himself
that
the
sense
of
irrevocableness
in
his
lot
,
which
ought
in
reason
to
have
been
as
strong
as
ever
,
had
been
shaken
by
a
change
of
circumstances
that
could
make
no
change
in
relation
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
told
himself
the
truth
quite
roughly
    
"
She
would
never
love
me
;
and
that
is
not
the
question
 
I
could
never
approach
her
as
a
lover
in
her
present
position
.
<EOS>
I
am
exactly
of
no
consequence
at
all
,
and
am
not
likely
to
be
of
much
consequence
till
my
head
is
turning
gray
.
<EOS>
But
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
?
<EOS>
She
would
not
have
me
on
any
terms
,
and
I
would
not
ask
her
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
meanness
to
be
thinking
about
it
now
 
no
better
than
lurking
about
the
battle
-
field
to
strip
the
dead
;
but
there
never
was
more
gratuitous
sinning
.
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
to
gain
there
 
absolutely
nothing
.
<EOS>
Then
why
ca
n't
I
face
the
facts
,
and
behave
as
they
demand
,
instead
of
leaving
my
father
to
suppose
that
there
are
matters
he
ca
n't
speak
to
me
about
,
though
I
might
be
useful
in
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
last
thought
made
one
wave
with
the
impulse
that
sent
Rex
walking
firmly
into
the
house
and
through
the
open
door
of
the
study
,
where
he
saw
his
father
packing
a
traveling
-
desk
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
I
be
of
any
use
,
sir
?
"
said
Rex
,
with
rallied
courage
,
as
his
father
looked
up
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
boy
;
when
I
'm
gone
,
just
see
to
my
letters
,
and
answer
where
necessary
,
and
send
me
word
of
everything
.
<EOS>
Dymock
will
manage
the
parish
very
well
,
and
you
will
stay
with
your
mother
,
or
,
at
least
,
go
up
and
down
again
,
till
I
come
back
,
whenever
that
may
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
hardly
be
very
long
,
sir
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Rex
,
beginning
to
strap
a
railway
rug
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
perhaps
bring
my
cousin
back
to
England
?
"
<EOS>
He
forced
himself
to
speak
of
Gwendolen
for
the
first
time
,
and
the
rector
noticed
the
epoch
with
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
depends
,
"
he
answered
,
taking
the
subject
as
a
matter
-
of
-
course
between
them
.
"
<EOS>
Perhaps
her
mother
may
stay
there
with
her
,
and
I
may
come
back
very
soon
.
<EOS>
This
telegram
leaves
us
in
ignorance
which
is
rather
anxious
.
<EOS>
But
no
doubt
the
arrangements
of
the
will
lately
made
are
satisfactory
,
and
there
may
possibly
be
an
heir
yet
to
be
born
.
<EOS>
In
any
case
,
I
feel
confident
that
Gwendolen
will
be
liberally
 
I
should
expect
,
splendidly
 
provided
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
must
have
been
a
great
shock
for
her
,
"
said
Rex
,
getting
more
resolute
after
the
first
twinge
had
been
borne
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
was
a
devoted
husband
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
of
it
,
"
said
the
rector
,
in
his
most
decided
manner
.
<EOS>
"
Few
men
of
his
position
would
have
come
forward
as
he
did
under
the
circumstances
.
"
  
<EOS>
Rex
had
never
seen
Grandcourt
,
had
never
been
spoken
to
about
him
by
any
one
of
the
family
,
and
knew
nothing
of
Gwendolen
's
flight
from
her
suitor
to
Leubronn
.
<EOS>
He
only
knew
that
Grandcourt
,
being
very
much
in
love
with
her
,
had
made
her
an
offer
in
the
first
weeks
of
her
sudden
poverty
,
and
had
behaved
very
handsomely
in
providing
for
her
mother
and
sisters
.
<EOS>
That
was
all
very
natural
and
what
Rex
himself
would
have
liked
to
do
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
had
been
a
lucky
fellow
,
and
had
had
some
happiness
before
he
got
drowned
.
<EOS>
Yet
Rex
wondered
much
whether
Gwendolen
had
been
in
love
with
the
successful
suitor
,
or
had
only
forborne
to
tell
him
that
she
hated
being
made
love
to
.
      
<EOS>
"
I
count
myself
in
nothing
else
<EOS>
so
happy
  
<EOS>
As
in
a
soul
remembering
my
good
friends
.

SHAKESPEARE
.
   
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
Mallinger
was
not
so
prompt
in
starting
for
Genoa
as
Mr.
Gascoigne
had
been
,
and
Deronda
on
all
accounts
would
not
take
his
departure
until
he
had
seen
the
baronet
.
<EOS>
There
was
not
only
Grandcourt
's
death
,
but
also
the
late
crisis
in
his
own
life
to
make
reasons
why
his
oldest
friend
would
desire
to
have
the
unrestrained
communication
of
speech
with
him
,
for
in
writing
he
had
not
felt
able
to
give
any
details
concerning
the
mother
who
had
come
and
gone
like
an
apparition
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
till
the
fifth
evening
that
Deronda
,
according
to
telegram
,
waited
for
Sir
Hugo
at
the
station
,
where
he
was
to
arrive
between
eight
and
nine
;
and
while
he
was
looking
forward
to
the
sight
of
the
kind
,
familiar
face
,
which
was
part
of
his
earliest
memories
,
something
like
a
smile
,
in
spite
of
his
late
tragic
experience
,
might
have
been
detected
in
his
eyes
and
the
curve
of
his
lips
at
the
idea
of
Sir
Hugo
's
pleasure
in
being
now
master
of
his
estates
,
able
to
leave
them
to
his
daughters
,
or
at
least
 
according
to
a
view
of
inheritance
which
had
just
been
strongly
impressed
on
Deronda
's
imagination
 
to
take
makeshift
feminine
offspring
as
intermediate
to
a
satisfactory
heir
in
a
grandson
.
<EOS>
We
should
be
churlish
creatures
if
we
could
have
no
joy
in
our
fellow
-
mortals
'
joy
,
unless
it
were
in
agreement
with
our
theory
of
righteous
distribution
and
our
highest
ideal
of
human
good
:
what
sour
corners
our
mouths
would
get
 
our
eyes
,
<EOS>
what
frozen
glances
!
<EOS>
and
all
the
while
our
own
possessions
and
desires
would
not
exactly
adjust
themselves
to
our
ideal
.
<EOS>
We
must
have
some
comradeship
with
imperfection
;
and
it
is
,
happily
,
possible
to
feel
gratitude
even
where
we
discern
a
mistake
that
may
have
been
injurious
,
the
vehicle
of
the
mistake
being
an
affectionate
intention
prosecuted
through
a
life
-
time
of
kindly
offices
.
<EOS>
Deronda
's
feeling
and
judgment
were
strongly
against
the
action
of
Sir
Hugo
in
making
himself
the
agent
of
a
falsity
 
<EOS>
yes
,
a
falsity
:
he
could
give
no
milder
name
to
the
concealment
under
which
he
had
been
reared
.
<EOS>
But
the
baronet
had
probably
had
no
clear
knowledge
concerning
the
mother
's
breach
of
trust
,
and
with
his
light
,
easy
way
of
taking
life
,
had
held
it
a
reasonable
preference
in
her
that
her
son
should
be
made
an
English
gentleman
,
seeing
that
she
had
the
eccentricity
of
not
caring
to
part
from
her
child
,
and
be
to
him
as
if
she
were
not
.
<EOS>
Daniel
's
affectionate
gratitude
toward
Sir
Hugo
made
him
wish
to
find
grounds
of
excuse
rather
than
blame
;
for
it
is
as
possible
to
be
rigid
in
principle
and
tender
in
blame
,
as
it
is
to
suffer
from
the
sight
of
things
hung
awry
,
and
yet
to
be
patient
with
the
hanger
who
sees
amiss
.
<EOS>
If
Sir
Hugo
in
his
bachelorhood
had
been
beguiled
into
regarding
children
chiefly
as
a
product
intended
to
make
life
more
agreeable
to
the
full
-
grown
,
whose
convenience
alone
was
to
be
consulted
in
the
disposal
of
them
 
why
,
he
had
shared
an
assumption
which
,
if
not
formally
avowed
,
was
massively
acted
on
at
that
date
of
the
world
's
history
;
and
Deronda
,
with
all
his
keen
memory
of
the
painful
inward
struggle
he
had
gone
through
in
his
boyhood
,
was
able
also
to
remember
the
many
signs
that
his
experience
had
been
entirely
shut
out
from
Sir
Hugo
's
conception
.
<EOS>
Ignorant
kindness
may
have
the
effect
of
cruelty
;
but
to
be
angry
with
it
as
if
it
were
direct
cruelty
would
be
an
ignorant
_
un_kindness
,
the
most
remote
from
Deronda
's
large
imaginative
lenience
toward
others
.
<EOS>
And
perhaps
now
,
after
the
searching
scenes
of
the
last
ten
days
,
in
which
the
curtain
had
been
lifted
for
him
from
the
secrets
of
lives
unlike
his
own
,
he
was
more
than
ever
disposed
to
check
that
rashness
of
indignation
or
resentment
which
has
an
unpleasant
likeness
to
the
love
of
punishing
.
<EOS>
When
he
saw
Sir
Hugo
's
familiar
figure
descending
from
the
railway
carriage
,
the
life
-
long
affection
which
had
been
well
accustomed
to
make
excuses
,
flowed
in
and
submerged
all
newer
knowledge
that
might
have
seemed
fresh
ground
for
blame
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Dan
,
"
said
Sir
Hugo
,
with
a
serious
fervor
,
grasping
Deronda
's
hand
.
<EOS>
He
uttered
no
other
words
of
greeting
;
there
was
too
strong
a
rush
of
mutual
consciousness
.
<EOS>
The
next
thing
was
to
give
orders
to
the
courier
,
and
then
to
propose
walking
slowly
in
,
the
mild
evening
,
there
being
no
hurry
to
get
to
the
hotel
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
taken
my
journey
easily
,
and
am
in
excellent
condition
,
"
he
said
,
as
he
and
Deronda
came
out
under
the
starlight
,
which
was
still
faint
with
the
lingering
sheen
of
day
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
hurry
in
setting
off
,
because
I
wanted
to
inquire
into
things
a
little
,
and
so
I
got
sight
of
your
letter
to
Lady
Mallinger
before
I
started
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
how
is
the
widow
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Getting
calmer
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
She
seems
to
be
escaping
the
bodily
illness
that
one
might
have
feared
for
her
,
after
her
plunge
and
terrible
excitement
.
<EOS>
Her
uncle
and
mother
came
two
days
ago
,
and
she
is
being
well
taken
care
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Any
prospect
of
an
heir
being
born
?
"
  
"
From
what
Mr.
Gascoigne
said
to
me
,
I
conclude
not
.
<EOS>
He
spoke
as
if
it
were
a
question
whether
the
widow
would
have
the
estates
for
her
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
not
be
much
of
a
wrench
to
her
affections
,
I
fancy
,
this
loss
of
the
husband
?
"
said
Sir
Hugo
,
looking
round
at
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
suddenness
of
the
death
has
been
a
great
blow
to
her
,
"
said
Deronda
,
quietly
evading
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
Grandcourt
gave
her
any
notion
what
were
the
provisions
of
his
will
?
"
said
Sir
Hugo
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
what
they
are
,
sir
?
"
parried
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
do
,
"
said
the
baronet
,
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Gad
!
<EOS>
if
there
is
no
prospect
of
a
legitimate
heir
,
he
has
left
everything
to
a
boy
he
had
by
a
Mrs.
Glasher
;
you
know
nothing
about
the
affair
,
I
suppose
,
but
she
was
a
sort
of
wife
to
him
for
a
good
many
years
,
and
there
are
three
older
children
 
girls
.
<EOS>
The
boy
is
to
take
his
father
's
name
;
he
is
Henleigh
already
,
and
he
is
to
be
Henleigh
Mallinger
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
The
Mallinger
will
be
of
no
use
to
him
,
I
am
happy
to
say
;
but
the
young
dog
will
have
more
than
enough
with
his
fourteen
years
'
minority
 
<EOS>
no
need
to
have
had
holes
filled
up
with
my
fifty
thousand
for
Diplow
that
he
had
no
right
to
:
and
meanwhile
my
beauty
,
the
young
widow
,
is
to
put
up
with
a
poor
two
thousand
a
year
and
the
house
at
Gadsmere
 
a
nice
kind
of
banishment
for
her
if
she
chose
to
shut
herself
up
there
,
which
I
do
n't
think
she
will
.
<EOS>
The
boy
's
mother
has
been
living
there
of
late
years
.
<EOS>
I
'm
perfectly
disgusted
with
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
that
I
'm
obliged
to
think
the
better
of
him
because
he
's
drowned
,
though
,
so
far
as
my
affairs
are
concerned
,
nothing
in
his
life
became
him
like
the
leaving
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
my
opinion
he
did
wrong
when
he
married
this
wife
 
not
in
leaving
his
estates
to
the
son
,
"
said
Deronda
,
rather
dryly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
nothing
against
his
leaving
the
land
to
the
lad
,
"
said
Sir
Hugo
;
"
<EOS>
but
since
he
had
married
this
girl
he
ought
to
have
given
her
a
handsome
provision
,
such
as
she
could
live
on
in
a
style
fitted
to
the
rank
he
had
raised
her
to
.
<EOS>
She
ought
to
have
had
four
or
five
thousand
a
year
and
the
London
house
for
her
life
;
that
's
what
I
should
have
done
for
her
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
,
as
she
was
penniless
,
her
friends
could
n't
stand
out
for
a
settlement
,
else
it
's
ill
trusting
to
the
will
a
man
may
make
after
he
's
married
.
<EOS>
Even
a
wise
man
generally
lets
some
folly
ooze
out
of
him
in
his
will
 
<EOS>
my
father
did
,
I
know
;
and
if
a
fellow
has
any
spite
or
tyranny
in
him
,
he
's
likely
to
bottle
off
a
good
deal
for
keeping
in
that
sort
of
document
.
<EOS>
It
's
quite
clear
<EOS>
Grandcourt
meant
that
his
death
should
put
an
extinguisher
on
his
wife
,
if
she
bore
him
no
heir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
,
in
the
other
case
,
I
suppose
everything
would
have
been
reversed
 
illegitimacy
would
have
had
the
extinguisher
?
"
said
Deronda
,
with
some
scorn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Precisely
 
Gadsmere
and
the
two
thousand
.
<EOS>
It
's
queer
.
<EOS>
One
nuisance
is
that
Grandcourt
has
made
me
an
executor
;
but
seeing
he
was
the
son
of
my
only
brother
,
I
ca
n't
refuse
to
act
.
<EOS>
And
I
shall
mind
it
less
if
I
can
be
of
any
use
to
the
widow
.
<EOS>
Lush
thinks
she
was
not
in
ignorance
about
the
family
under
the
rose
,
and
the
purport
of
the
will
.
<EOS>
He
hints
that
there
was
no
very
good
understanding
between
the
couple
.
<EOS>
But
I
fancy
you
are
the
man
who
knew
most
about
what
Mrs.
Grandcourt
felt
or
did
not
feel
 
eh
,
Dan
?
"
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
did
not
put
this
question
with
his
usual
jocoseness
,
but
rather
with
a
lowered
tone
of
interested
inquiry
;
and
Deronda
felt
that
any
evasion
would
be
misinterpreted
.
<EOS>
He
answered
gravely
    
"
She
was
certainly
not
happy
.
<EOS>
They
were
unsuited
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
But
as
to
the
disposal
of
the
property
 
from
all
I
have
seen
of
her
,
I
should
predict
that
she
will
be
quite
contented
with
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
she
is
not
much
like
the
rest
of
her
sex
;
that
's
all
I
can
say
,
"
said
Sir
Hugo
,
with
a
slight
shrug
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
However
,
she
ought
to
be
something
extraordinary
,
for
there
must
be
an
entanglement
between
your
horoscope
and
hers
 
<EOS>
eh
?
<EOS>
When
that
tremendous
telegram
came
,
the
first
thing
Lady
Mallinger
said
was
,
"
How
very
strange
that
it
should
be
Daniel
who
sends
it
!
"
<EOS>
But
I
have
had
something
of
the
same
sort
in
my
own
life
.
<EOS>
I
was
once
at
a
foreign
hotel
where
a
lady
had
been
left
by
her
husband
without
money
.
<EOS>
When
I
heard
of
it
,
and
came
forward
to
help
her
,
who
should
she
be
but
an
early
flame
of
mine
,
who
had
been
fool
enough
to
marry
an
Austrian
baron
with
a
long
mustache
and
short
affection
?
<EOS>
But
it
was
an
affair
of
my
own
that
called
me
there
 
nothing
to
do
with
knight
-
errantry
,
any
more
than
you
coming
to
Genoa
<EOS>
had
to
do
with
the
Grandcourts
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
silence
for
a
little
while
.
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
had
begun
to
talk
of
the
Grandcourts
as
the
less
difficult
subject
between
himself
and
Deronda
;
but
they
were
both
wishing
to
overcome
a
reluctance
to
perfect
frankness
on
the
events
which
touched
their
relation
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
Deronda
felt
that
his
letter
,
after
the
first
interview
with
his
mother
,
had
been
rather
a
thickening
than
a
breaking
of
the
ice
,
and
that
he
ought
to
wait
for
the
first
opening
to
come
from
Sir
Hugo
.
<EOS>
Just
when
they
were
about
to
lose
sight
of
the
port
,
the
baronet
turned
,
and
pausing
as
if
to
get
a
last
view
,
said
in
a
tone
of
more
serious
feeling
 
"
<EOS>
And
about
the
main
business
of
your
coming
to
Genoa
,
Dan
?
<EOS>
You
have
not
been
deeply
pained
by
anything
you
have
learned
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
that
you
feel
need
change
your
position
in
any
way
?
<EOS>
You
know
,
whatever
happens
to
you
must
always
be
of
importance
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
desire
to
meet
your
goodness
by
perfect
confidence
,
sir
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
ca
n't
answer
those
questions
truly
by
a
simple
yes
<EOS>
or
no
.
<EOS>
Much
that
I
have
heard
about
the
past
has
pained
me
.
<EOS>
And
it
has
been
a
pain
to
meet
and
part
with
my
mother
in
her
suffering
state
,
as
I
have
been
compelled
to
do
,
But
it
is
no
pain
 
<EOS>
it
is
rather
a
clearing
up
of
doubts
for
which
I
am
thankful
,
to
know
my
parentage
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
effect
on
my
position
,
there
will
be
no
change
in
my
gratitude
to
you
,
sir
,
for
the
fatherly
care
and
affection
you
have
always
shown
me
.
<EOS>
But
to
know
that
I
was
born
a
Jew
,
may
have
a
momentous
influence
on
my
life
,
which
I
am
hardly
able
to
tell
you
of
at
present
.
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
spoke
the
last
sentence
with
a
resolve
that
overcame
some
diffidence
.
<EOS>
He
felt
that
the
differences
between
Sir
Hugo
's
nature
and
his
own
would
have
,
by
-
and
-
by
,
to
disclose
themselves
more
markedly
than
had
ever
yet
been
needful
.
<EOS>
The
baronet
gave
him
a
quick
glance
,
and
turned
to
walk
on
.
<EOS>
After
a
few
moments
'
silence
,
in
which
he
had
reviewed
all
the
material
in
his
memory
which
would
enable
him
to
interpret
Deronda
's
words
,
he
said
    
"
I
have
long
expected
something
remarkable
from
you
,
Dan
;
but
,
for
God
's
sake
,
do
n't
go
into
any
eccentricities
!
<EOS>
I
can
tolerate
any
man
's
difference
of
opinion
,
but
let
him
tell
it
me
without
getting
himself
up
as
a
lunatic
.
<EOS>
At
this
stage
of
the
world
,
if
a
man
wants
to
be
taken
seriously
,
he
must
keep
clear
of
melodrama
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
misunderstand
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
suspecting
you
of
setting
up
any
lunacy
on
your
own
account
.
<EOS>
I
only
think
you
might
easily
be
led
arm
in
arm
with
a
lunatic
,
especially
if
he
wanted
defending
.
<EOS>
You
have
a
passion
for
people
who
are
pelted
,
Dan
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sorry
for
them
too
;
but
so
far
as
company
goes
,
it
's
a
bad
ground
of
selection
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
do
n't
ask
you
to
anticipate
your
inclination
in
anything
you
have
to
tell
me
.
<EOS>
When
you
make
up
your
mind
to
a
course
that
requires
money
,
I
have
some
sixteen
thousand
pounds
that
have
been
accumulating
for
you
over
and
above
what
you
have
been
having
the
interest
of
as
income
.
<EOS>
And
now
I
am
come
,
I
suppose
you
want
to
get
back
to
England
as
soon
as
you
can
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
first
to
Mainz
to
get
away
a
chest
of
my
grandfather
's
,
and
perhaps
to
see
a
friend
of
his
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
Although
the
chest
has
been
lying
there
these
twenty
years
,
I
have
an
unreasonable
sort
of
nervous
eagerness
to
get
it
away
under
my
care
,
as
if
it
were
more
likely
now
than
before
that
something
might
happen
to
it
.
<EOS>
And
perhaps
I
am
the
more
uneasy
,
because
I
lingered
after
my
mother
left
,
instead
of
setting
out
immediately
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
ca
n't
regret
that
I
was
here
 
else
Mrs.
Grandcourt
would
have
had
none
but
servants
to
act
for
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
"
said
Sir
Hugo
,
with
a
flippancy
which
was
an
escape
of
some
vexation
hidden
under
his
more
serious
speech
;
"
I
hope
you
are
not
going
to
set
a
dead
Jew
above
a
living
Christian
.
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
colored
,
and
repressed
a
retort
.
<EOS>
They
were
just
turning
into
the
_
Italia
_
.
        
<EOS>
"
But
I
shall
say
no
more
of
this
at
this
time
;
for
this
is
to
be
felt
    
and
not
to
be
talked
of
;
and
they
who
never
touched
it
with
their
    
fingers
may
secretly
perhaps
laugh
at
it
in
their
hearts
and
be
never
    
the
wiser

ten

avenge

And
there
have

When
Deronda
presented
his
letter
at
the
banking
-
house
in
the
_
Schuster
Strasse
_
at
Mainz
,
and
asked
for
Joseph
Kalonymos
,
he
was
presently
shown
into
an
inner
room
,
where
,
seated
at
a
table
arranging
open
letters
,
was
the
white
-
bearded
man
whom
he
had
seen
the
year
before
in
the
synagogue
at
Frankfort
.
<EOS>
He
wore
his
hat
 
<EOS>
it
seemed
to
be
the
same
old
felt
hat
as
before
 
and
near
him
<EOS>
was
a
packed
portmanteau
with
a
wrap
and
overcoat
upon
it
.
<EOS>
On
seeing
Deronda
enter
he
rose
,
but
did
not
advance
or
put
out
his
hand
.
<EOS>
Looking
at
him
with
small
penetrating
eyes
which
glittered
like
black
gems
in
the
midst
of
his
yellowish
face
and
white
hair
,
he
said
in
German
    
"
Good
!
<EOS>
It
is
now
you
who
seek
me
,
young
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
seek
you
with
gratitude
,
as
a
friend
of
my
grandfather
's
,
"
said
Deronda
,
"
and
I
am
under
an
obligation
to
you
for
giving
yourself
much
trouble
on
my
account
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
spoke
without
difficulty
in
that
liberal
German
tongue
which
takes
many
strange
accents
to
its
maternal
bosom
.
  
<EOS>
Kalonymos
now
put
out
his
hand
and
said
cordially
,
"
So
you
are
no
longer
angry
at
being
something
more
than
an
Englishman
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
I
thank
you
heartily
for
helping
to
save
me
from
remaining
in
ignorance
of
my
parentage
,
and
for
taking
care
of
the
chest
that
my
grandfather
left
in
trust
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
,
sit
down
,
"
said
Kalonymos
,
in
a
quick
undertone
,
seating
himself
again
,
and
pointing
to
a
chair
near
him
.
<EOS>
Then
deliberately
laying
aside
his
hat
and
showing
a
head
thickly
covered
,
with
white
hair
,
he
stroked
and
clutched
his
beard
while
he
looked
examiningly
at
the
young
face
before
him
.
<EOS>
The
moment
wrought
strongly
on
Deronda
's
imaginative
susceptibility
:
in
the
presence
of
one
linked
still
in
zealous
friendship
with
the
grandfather
whose
hope
had
yearned
toward
him
when
he
was
unborn
,
and
who
,
though
dead
,
was
yet
to
speak
with
him
in
those
written
memorials
which
,
says
Milton
,
"
contain
a
potency
of
life
in
them
to
be
as
active
as
that
soul
whose
progeny
they
are
,
"
he
seemed
to
himself
to
be
touching
the
electric
chain
of
his
own
ancestry
;
and
he
bore
the
scrutinizing
look
of
Kalonymos
with
a
delighted
awe
,
something
like
what
one
feels
in
the
solemn
commemoration
of
acts
done
long
ago
but
still
telling
markedly
on
the
life
of
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Impossible
for
men
of
duller
,
fibre
 
men
whose
affection
is
not
ready
to
diffuse
itself
through
the
wide
travel
of
imagination
,
to
comprehend
,
perhaps
even
to
credit
this
sensibility
of
Deronda
's
;
but
it
subsisted
,
like
their
own
dullness
,
notwithstanding
their
lack
of
belief
in
it
 
<EOS>
and
it
gave
his
face
an
expression
which
seemed
very
satisfactory
to
the
observer
.
  
<EOS>
He
said
in
Hebrew
,
quoting
from
one
of
the
fine
hymns
in
the
Hebrew
liturgy
,
"
As
thy
goodness
has
been
great
to
the
former
generations
,
even
so
may
it
be
to
the
latter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
after
pausing
a
little
he
began
,
"
Young
man
,
I
rejoice
that
I
was
not
yet
set
off
again
on
my
travels
,
and
that
you
are
come
in
time
for
me
to
see
the
image
of
my
friend
as
he
was
in
his
youth
 
no
longer
perverted
from
the
fellowship
of
your
people
 
no
longer
shrinking
in
proud
wrath
from
the
touch
of
him
who
seemed
to
be
claiming
you
as
a
Jew
.
<EOS>
You
come
with
thankfulness
yourself
to
claim
the
kindred
and
heritage
that
wicked
contrivance
would
have
robbed
you
of
.
<EOS>
You
come
with
a
willing
soul
to
declare
,
"
I
am
the
grandson
of
Daniel
Charisi
.
<EOS>
"
Is
it
not
so
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Assuredly
it
is
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
But
let
me
say
that
I
should
at
no
time
have
been
inclined
to
treat
a
Jew
with
incivility
simply
because
he
was
a
Jew
.
<EOS>
You
can
understand
that
I
shrank
from
saying
to
a
stranger
,
"
I
know
nothing
of
my
mother
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
A
sin
,
a
sin
!
"
said
Kalonymos
,
putting
up
his
hand
and
closing
his
eyes
in
disgust
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
robbery
of
our
people
 
as
when
our
youths
and
maidens
were
reared
for
the
Roman
Edom
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
frustrated
.
<EOS>
I
have
frustrated
it
.
<EOS>
When
Daniel
Charisi
 
may
his
Rock
and
his
Redeemer
guard
him
!
 
<EOS>
when
Daniel
Charisi
was
a
stripling
<EOS>
and
I
was
a
lad
little
above
his
shoulder
,
we
made
a
solemn
vow
always
to
be
friends
.
<EOS>
He
said
,
"
Let
us
bind
ourselves
with
duty
,
as
if
we
were
sons
of
the
same
mother
.
<EOS>
"
That
was
his
bent
from
first
to
last
 
as
he
said
,
to
fortify
his
soul
with
bonds
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
saying
of
his
,
"
Let
us
bind
love
with
duty
;
for
duty
is
the
love
of
law
;
and
law
is
the
nature
of
the
Eternal
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
we
bound
ourselves
.
<EOS>
And
though
we
were
much
apart
in
our
later
life
,
the
bond
has
never
been
broken
.
<EOS>
When
he
was
dead
,
they
sought
to
rob
him
;
but
they
could
not
rob
him
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
rescued
that
remainder
of
him
which
he
had
prized
and
preserved
for
his
offspring
.
<EOS>
And
I
have
restored
to
him
the
offspring
they
had
robbed
him
of
.
<EOS>
I
will
bring
you
the
chest
forthwith
.
"
  
<EOS>
Kalonymos
left
the
room
for
a
few
minutes
,
and
returned
with
a
clerk
who
carried
the
chest
,
set
it
down
on
the
floor
,
drew
off
a
leather
cover
,
and
went
out
again
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
very
large
,
but
was
made
heavy
by
ornamental
bracers
and
handles
of
gilt
iron
.
<EOS>
The
wood
was
beautifully
incised
with
Arabic
lettering
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
!
"
said
Kalonymos
,
returning
to
his
seat
.
"
<EOS>
And
here
is
the
curious
key
,
"
he
added
,
taking
it
from
a
small
leathern
bag
.
<EOS>
"
Bestow
it
carefully
.
<EOS>
I
trust
you
are
methodic
and
wary
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
gave
Deronda
the
monitory
and
slightly
suspicious
look
with
which
age
is
apt
to
commit
any
object
to
the
keeping
of
youth
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
more
careful
of
this
than
of
any
other
property
,
"
said
Deronda
,
smiling
and
putting
the
key
in
his
breast
-
pocket
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
before
possessed
anything
that
was
a
sign
to
me
of
so
much
cherished
hope
and
effort
.
<EOS>
And
I
shall
never
forget
that
the
effort
was
partly
yours
.
<EOS>
Have
you
time
to
tell
me
more
of
my
grandfather
?
<EOS>
Or
shall
I
be
trespassing
in
staying
longer
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Stay
yet
a
while
.
<EOS>
In
an
hour
and
eighteen
minutes
I
start
for
Trieste
,
"
said
Kalonymos
,
looking
at
his
watch
,
"
and
presently
my
sons
will
expect
my
attention
.
<EOS>
Will
you
let
me
make
you
known
to
them
,
so
that
they
may
have
the
pleasure
of
showing
hospitality
to
my
friend
's
grandson
?
<EOS>
They
dwell
here
in
ease
and
luxury
,
though
I
choose
to
be
a
wanderer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
glad
if
you
will
commend
me
to
their
acquaintance
for
some
future
opportunity
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
There
are
pressing
claims
calling
me
to
England
 
friends
who
may
be
much
in
need
of
my
presence
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
kept
away
from
them
too
long
by
unexpected
circumstances
.
<EOS>
But
to
know
more
of
you
and
your
family
would
be
motive
enough
to
bring
me
again
to
Mainz
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
!
<EOS>
Me
<EOS>
you
will
hardly
find
,
for
I
am
beyond
my
threescore
years
and
ten
,
and
I
am
a
wanderer
,
carrying
my
shroud
with
me
.
<EOS>
But
my
sons
and
their
children
dwell
here
in
wealth
and
unity
.
<EOS>
The
days
are
changed
for
us
since
Karl
the
Great
fetched
my
ancestors
from
Italy
to
bring
some
tincture
of
knowledge
to
our
rough
German
brethren
.
<EOS>
I
and
my
contemporaries
have
had
to
fight
for
it
too
.
<EOS>
Our
youth
fell
on
evil
days
;
but
this
we
have
won
;
we
increase
our
wealth
in
safety
,
and
the
learning
of
all
Germany
is
fed
and
fattened
by
Jewish
brains
 
though
they
keep
not
always
their
Jewish
hearts
.
<EOS>
Have
you
been
left
altogether
ignorant
of
your
people
's
life
,
young
man
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Deronda
,
"
I
have
lately
,
before
I
had
any
true
suspicion
of
my
parentage
,
been
led
to
study
everything
belonging
to
their
history
with
more
interest
than
any
other
subject
.
<EOS>
It
turns
out
that
I
have
been
making
myself
ready
to
understand
my
grandfather
a
little
.
"
<EOS>
He
was
anxious
less
the
time
should
be
consumed
before
this
circuitous
course
of
talk
could
lead
them
back
to
the
topic
he
most
cared
about
.
<EOS>
Age
does
not
easily
distinguish
between
what
it
needs
to
express
and
what
youth
needs
to
know
-
distance
seeming
to
level
the
objects
of
memory
;
and
keenly
active
as
Joseph
Kalonymos
showed
himself
,
an
inkstand
in
the
wrong
place
would
have
hindered
his
imagination
from
getting
to
Beyrout
:
he
had
been
used
to
unite
restless
travel
with
punctilious
observation
.
<EOS>
But
Deronda
's
last
sentence
answered
its
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
-
you
would
perhaps
have
been
such
a
man
as
he
if
your
education
had
not
hindered
;
for
you
are
like
him
in
features
:
 
yet
not
altogether
,
young
man
.
<EOS>
He
had
an
iron
will
in
his
face
:
it
braced
up
everybody
about
him
.
<EOS>
When
he
was
quite
young
he
had
already
got
one
deep
upright
line
in
his
brow
.
<EOS>
I
see
none
of
that
in
you
.
<EOS>
Daniel
Charisi
used
to
say
,
"
Better
,
a
wrong
will
than
a
wavering
;
better
a
steadfast
enemy
than
an
uncertain
friend
;
better
a
false
belief
than
no
belief
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
What
he
despised
most
was
indifference
.
<EOS>
He
had
longer
reasons
than
I
can
give
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yet
his
knowledge
was
not
narrow
?
"
said
Deronda
,
with
a
tacit
reference
to
the
usual
excuse
for
indecision
 
that
it
comes
from
knowing
too
much
.
  
<EOS>
"
Narrow
?
<EOS>
no
,
"
said
Kalonymos
,
shaking
his
head
with
a
compassionate
smile
"
From
his
childhood
upward
,
he
drank
in
learning
as
easily
as
the
plant
sucks
up
water
.
<EOS>
But
he
early
took
to
medicine
and
theories
about
life
and
health
.
<EOS>
He
traveled
to
many
countries
,
and
spent
much
of
his
substance
in
seeing
and
knowing
.
<EOS>
What
he
used
to
insist
on
was
that
the
strength
and
wealth
of
mankind
depended
on
the
balance
of
separateness
and
communication
,
and
he
was
bitterly
against
our
people
losing
themselves
among
the
Gentiles
;
"
It
's
no
better
,
"
said
he
,
"
than
the
many
sorts
of
grain
going
back
from
their
variety
into
sameness
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
mingled
all
sorts
of
learning
;
and
in
that
he
was
like
our
Arabic
writers
in
the
golden
time
.
<EOS>
We
studied
together
,
but
he
went
beyond
me
.
<EOS>
Though
we
were
bosom
friends
,
and
he
poured
himself
out
to
me
,
we
were
as
different
as
the
inside
and
outside
of
the
bowl
.
<EOS>
I
stood
up
for
two
notions
of
my
own
:
I
took
Charisi
's
sayings
as
I
took
the
shape
of
the
trees
:
they
were
there
,
not
to
be
disputed
about
.
<EOS>
It
came
to
the
same
thing
in
both
of
us
;
we
were
both
faithful
Jews
,
thankful
not
to
be
Gentiles
.
<EOS>
And
since
I
was
a
ripe
man
,
I
have
been
what
I
am
now
,
for
all
but
age
-
loving
to
wander
,
loving
transactions
,
loving
to
behold
all
things
,
and
caring
nothing
about
hardship
.
<EOS>
Charisi
thought
continually
of
our
people
's
future
:
he
went
with
all
his
soul
into
that
part
of
our
religion
:
<EOS>
I
,
not
.
<EOS>
So
we
have
freedom
,
I
am
content
.
<EOS>
Our
people
wandered
before
they
were
driven
.
<EOS>
Young
man
when
I
am
in
the
East
,
I
lie
much
on
deck
and
watch
the
greater
stars
.
<EOS>
The
sight
of
them
satisfies
me
.
<EOS>
I
know
them
as
they
rise
,
and
hunger
not
to
know
more
.
<EOS>
Charisi
was
satisfied
with
no
sight
,
but
pieced
it
out
with
what
had
been
before
and
what
would
come
after
.
<EOS>
Yet
we
loved
each
other
,
and
as
he
said
,
he
bound
our
love
with
duty
;
we
solemnly
pledged
ourselves
to
help
and
defend
each
other
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
I
have
fulfilled
my
pledge
.
<EOS>
"
Here
Kalonymos
rose
,
and
Deronda
,
rising
also
,
said
    
"
<EOS>
And
in
being
faithful
to
him
you
have
caused
justice
to
be
done
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
a
robbery
of
me
too
that
I
should
never
have
known
of
the
inheritance
he
had
prepared
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
thank
you
with
my
whole
soul
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Be
worthy
of
him
,
young
man
.
<EOS>
What
is
your
vocation
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
question
was
put
with
a
quick
abruptness
which
embarrassed
Deronda
,
who
did
not
feel
it
quite
honest
to
allege
his
law
-
reading
as
a
vocation
.
<EOS>
He
answered
    
"
I
can
not
say
that
I
have
any
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Get
one
,
get
one
.
<EOS>
The
Jew
must
be
diligent
.
<EOS>
You
will
call
yourself
a
Jew
and
profess
the
faith
of
your
fathers
?
"
said
Kalonymos
,
putting
his
hand
on
Deronda
's
shoulder
and
looking
sharply
in
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
call
myself
a
Jew
,
"
said
Deronda
,
deliberately
,
becoming
slightly
paler
under
the
piercing
eyes
of
his
questioner
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
will
not
say
that
I
shall
profess
to
believe
exactly
as
my
fathers
have
believed
.
<EOS>
Our
fathers
themselves
changed
the
horizon
of
their
belief
and
learned
of
other
races
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
I
can
maintain
my
grandfather
's
notion
of
separateness
with
communication
.
<EOS>
I
hold
that
my
first
duty
is
to
my
own
people
,
and
if
there
is
anything
to
be
done
toward
restoring
or
perfecting
their
common
life
,
I
shall
make
that
my
vocation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
happened
to
Deronda
at
that
moment
,
as
it
has
often
happened
to
others
,
that
the
need
for
speech
made
an
epoch
in
resolve
.
<EOS>
His
respect
for
the
questioner
would
not
let
him
decline
to
answer
,
and
by
the
necessity
to
answer
he
found
out
the
truth
for
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
you
argue
and
you
look
forward
 
<EOS>
you
are
Daniel
Charisi
's
grandson
,
"
said
Kalonymos
,
adding
a
benediction
in
Hebrew
.
  
<EOS>
With
that
they
parted
;
and
almost
as
soon
as
Deronda
was
in
London
,
the
aged
man
was
again
on
shipboard
,
greeting
the
friendly
stars
without
any
eager
curiosity
.
      
<EOS>
"
Within
the
gentle
heart
Love
shelters
him
,
    
As
birds
within
the
green
shade
of
the

<EOS>
Before
the
gentle
heart
,
in
Nature

,
    
Love
was
not
,
nor
the
gentle
heart
ere
Love

There
was
another
house
besides
the
white
house
at
Pennicote
,
another
breast
besides
Rex
Gascoigne
's
,
in
which
the
news
of
Grandcourt
's
death
caused
both
strong
agitation
and
the
effort
to
repress
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
Hans
Meyrick
's
habit
to
send
or
bring
in
the
_
Times
_
for
his
mother
's
reading
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
great
reader
of
news
,
from
the
widest
-
reaching
politics
to
the
list
of
marriages
;
the
latter
,
she
said
,
giving
her
the
pleasant
sense
of
finishing
the
fashionable
novels
without
having
read
them
,
and
seeing
the
heroes
and
heroines
happy
without
knowing
what
poor
creatures
they
were
.
<EOS>
On
a
Wednesday
,
there
were
reasons
why
Hans
always
chose
to
bring
the
paper
,
and
to
do
so
about
the
time
that
Mirah
had
nearly
ended
giving
Mab
her
weekly
lesson
,
avowing
that
he
came
then
because
he
wanted
to
hear
Mirah
sing
.
<EOS>
But
on
the
particular
Wednesday
now
in
question
,
after
entering
the
house
as
quietly
as
usual
with
his
latch
-
key
,
he
appeared
in
the
parlor
,
shaking
the
_
Times
_
aloft
with
a
crackling
noise
,
in
remorseless
interruption
of
Mab
's
attempt
to
render
_
Lascia
ch'io
pianga
_
with
a
remote
imitation
of
her
teacher
.
<EOS>
Piano
and
song
ceased
immediately
;
Mirah
,
who
had
been
playing
the
accompaniment
,
involuntarily
started
up
and
turned
round
,
the
crackling
sound
,
after
the
occasional
trick
of
sounds
,
having
seemed
to
her
something
thunderous
;
and
Mab
said
    
"
O
-
o
-
o
,
Hans
!
<EOS>
why
do
you
bring
a
more
horrible
noise
than
my
singing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
on
earth
is
the
wonderful
news
?
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
who
was
the
only
other
person
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Anything
about
Italy
 
anything
about
the
Austrians
giving
up
Venice
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Nothing
about
Italy
,
but
something
from
Italy
,
"
said
Hans
,
with
a
peculiarity
in
his
tone
and
manner
which
set
his
mother
interpreting
.
<EOS>
Imagine
how
some
of
us
feel
and
behave
when
an
event
,
not
disagreeable
seems
to
be
confirming
and
carrying
out
our
private
constructions
.
<EOS>
We
say
,
"
What
do
you
think
?
"
in
a
pregnant
tone
to
some
innocent
person
who
has
not
embarked
his
wisdom
in
the
same
boat
with
ours
,
and
finds
our
information
flat
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
bad
?
"
said
Mrs.
Meyrick
anxiously
,
thinking
immediately
of
Deronda
;
and
Mirah
's
heart
had
been
already
clutched
by
the
same
thought
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
bad
for
anybody
we
care
much
about
,
"
said
Hans
,
quickly
;
"
rather
uncommonly
lucky
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
I
never
knew
anybody
die
conveniently
before
.
<EOS>
Considering
what
a
dear
gazelle
I
am
,
I
am
constantly
wondering
to
find
myself
alive
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
me
,
Hans
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mab
,
impatiently
,
"
if
you
must
talk
of
yourself
,
let
it
be
behind
your
own
back
.
<EOS>
What
_
is
_
<EOS>
it
that
has
happened
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Duke
Alfonso
is
drowned
,
and
the
Duchess
is
alive
,
that
's
all
,
"
said
Hans
,
putting
the
paper
before
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
with
his
finger
against
a
paragraph
.
<EOS>
"
But
more
than
all
is
 
Deronda
was
at
Genoa
in
the
same
hotel
with
them
,
and
he
saw
her
brought
in
by
the
fishermen
who
had
got
her
out
of
the
water
time
enough
to
save
her
from
any
harm
.
<EOS>
It
seems
they
saw
her
jump
in
after
her
husband
,
which
was
a
less
judicious
action
than
I
should
have
expected
of
the
Duchess
.
<EOS>
However
Deronda
is
a
lucky
fellow
in
being
there
to
take
care
of
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mirah
had
sunk
on
the
music
stool
again
,
with
her
eyelids
down
and
her
hands
tightly
clasped
;
and
Mrs.
Meyrick
,
giving
up
the
paper
to
Mab
,
said
    
"
Poor
thing
!
<EOS>
she
must
have
been
fond
of
her
husband
to
jump
in
after
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
an
inadvertence
 
a
little
absence
of
mind
,
"
said
Hans
,
creasing
his
face
roguishly
,
and
throwing
himself
into
a
chair
not
far
from
Mirah
.
<EOS>
"
Who
can
be
fond
of
a
jealous
baritone
,
with
freezing
glances
,
always
singing
asides
?
 
<EOS>
that
was
<EOS>
the
husband
's
_
rôle
_
,
depend
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Nothing
can
be
neater
than
his
getting
drowned
.
<EOS>
The
Duchess
is
at
liberty
now
to
marry
a
man
with
a
fine
head
of
hair
,
and
glances
that
will
melt
instead
of
freezing
her
.
<EOS>
And
I
shall
be
invited
to
the
wedding
.
"
  
<EOS>
Here
Mirah
started
from
her
sitting
posture
,
and
fixing
her
eyes
on
Hans
,
with
an
angry
gleam
in
them
,
she
said
,
in
a
deeply
-
shaken
voice
of
indignation
    
"
Mr.
Hans
,
you
ought
not
to
speak
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Deronda
would
not
like
you
to
speak
so
.
<EOS>
Why
will
you
say
he
is
lucky
 
<EOS>
why
will
you
use
words
of
that
sort
about
life
and
death
 
when
what
is
life
to
one
is
death
to
another
?
<EOS>
How
do
you
know
it
would
be
lucky
if
he
loved
Mrs.
Grandcourt
?
<EOS>
It
might
be
a
great
evil
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
would
take
him
away
from
my
brother
 
<EOS>
I
know
she
would
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Deronda
would
not
call
that
lucky
to
pierce
my
brother
's
heart
.
"
  
<EOS>
All
three
were
struck
with
the
sudden
transformation
.
<EOS>
Mirah
's
face
,
with
a
look
of
anger
that
might
have
suited
Ithuriel
,
pale
,
even
to
the
lips
that
were
usually
so
rich
of
tint
,
was
not
far
from
poor
Hans
,
who
sat
transfixed
,
blushing
under
it
as
if
he
had
been
a
girl
,
while
he
said
,
nervously
    
"
I
am
a
fool
and
a
brute
,
and
I
withdraw
every
word
.
<EOS>
I
'll
go
and
hang
myself
like
Judas
 
if
it
's
allowable
to
mention
him
.
"
<EOS>
Even
in
Hans
's
sorrowful
moments
,
his
improvised
words
had
inevitably
some
drollery
.
  
<EOS>
But
Mirah
's
anger
was
not
appeased
<EOS>
:
how
could
it
be
?
<EOS>
She
had
burst
into
indignant
speech
as
creatures
in
intense
pain
bite
and
make
their
teeth
meet
even
through
their
own
flesh
,
by
way
of
making
their
agony
bearable
.
<EOS>
She
said
no
more
,
but
,
seating
herself
at
the
piano
,
pressed
the
sheet
of
music
before
her
,
as
if
she
thought
of
beginning
to
play
again
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
Mab
who
spoke
,
while
Mrs.
Meyrick
's
face
seemed
to
reflect
some
of
Hans
'
discomfort
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mirah
is
quite
right
to
scold
you
,
Hans
.
<EOS>
You
are
always
taking
Mr.
Deronda
's
name
in
vain
.
<EOS>
And
it
is
horrible
,
joking
in
that
way
about
his
marrying
Mrs.
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
Men
's
minds
must
be
very
black
,
I
think
,
"
ended
Mab
,
with
much
scorn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
true
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Hans
,
in
a
low
tone
,
rising
and
turning
on
his
heel
to
walk
toward
the
back
window
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
had
better
go
on
,
Mab
;
you
have
not
given
your
full
time
to
the
lesson
,
"
said
Mirah
,
in
a
higher
tone
than
usual
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Will
you
sing
this
again
,
or
shall
I
sing
it
to
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
please
sing
it
to
me
,
"
said
Mab
,
rejoiced
to
take
no
more
notice
of
what
had
happened
.
  
<EOS>
And
Mirah
immediately
sang
_
Lascia
ch'io
pianga
_
,
giving
forth
its
melodious
sobs
and
cries
with
new
fullness
and
energy
.
<EOS>
Hans
paused
in
his
walk
and
leaned
against
the
mantel
-
piece
,
keeping
his
eyes
carefully
away
from
his
mother
's
.
<EOS>
When
Mirah
had
sung
her
last
note
and
touched
the
last
chord
,
she
rose
and
said
,
"
I
must
go
home
now
.
<EOS>
Ezra
expects
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
gave
her
hand
silently
to
Mrs.
Meyrick
and
hung
back
a
little
,
not
daring
to
look
at
her
,
instead
of
kissing
her
,
as
usual
.
<EOS>
But
the
little
mother
drew
Mirah
's
face
down
to
hers
,
and
said
,
soothingly
,
"
God
bless
you
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mirah
felt
that
she
had
committed
an
offense
against
Mrs.
Meyrick
by
angrily
rebuking
Hans
,
and
mixed
with
the
rest
of
her
suffering
was
the
sense
that
she
had
shown
something
like
a
proud
ingratitude
,
an
unbecoming
assertion
of
superiority
.
<EOS>
And
her
friend
had
divined
this
compunction
.
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
Hans
had
seized
his
wide
-
awake
,
and
was
ready
to
open
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Hans
,
"
said
Mab
,
with
what
was
really
a
sister
's
tenderness
cunningly
disguised
,
"
you
are
not
going
to
walk
home
with
Mirah
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
she
would
rather
not
.
<EOS>
You
are
so
dreadfully
disagreeable
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
go
to
take
care
of
her
,
if
she
does
not
forbid
me
,
"
said
Hans
,
opening
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
Mirah
said
nothing
,
and
when
he
had
opened
the
outer
door
for
her
and
closed
it
behind
him
,
he
walked
by
her
side
unforbidden
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
the
courage
to
begin
speaking
to
him
again
 
conscious
that
she
had
perhaps
been
unbecomingly
severe
in
her
words
to
him
,
yet
finding
only
severer
words
behind
them
in
her
heart
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
she
was
pressed
upon
by
a
crowd
of
thoughts
thrusting
themselves
forward
as
interpreters
of
that
consciousness
which
still
remained
unaltered
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
Hans
,
on
his
side
,
had
a
mind
equally
busy
.
<EOS>
Mirah
's
anger
had
waked
in
him
a
new
perception
,
and
with
it
the
unpleasant
sense
that
he
was
a
dolt
not
to
have
had
it
before
.
<EOS>
Suppose
Mirah
's
heart
were
entirely
preoccupied
with
Deronda
in
another
character
than
that
of
her
own
and
her
brother
's
benefactor
;
the
supposition
was
attended
in
Hans
's
mind
with
anxieties
which
,
to
do
him
justice
,
were
not
altogether
selfish
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
strong
persuasion
,
which
only
direct
evidence
to
the
contrary
could
have
dissipated
,
and
that
was
that
there
was
a
serious
attachment
between
Deronda
and
Mrs.
Grandcourt
;
he
had
pieced
together
many
fragments
of
observation
,
and
gradually
gathered
knowledge
,
completed
by
what
his
sisters
had
heard
from
Anna
Gascoigne
,
which
convinced
him
not
only
that
Mrs.
Grandcourt
had
a
passion
for
Deronda
,
but
also
,
notwithstanding
his
friend
's
austere
self
-
repression
,
that
Deronda
's
susceptibility
about
her
was
the
sign
of
concealed
love
.
<EOS>
Some
men
,
having
such
a
conviction
,
would
have
avoided
allusions
that
could
have
roused
that
susceptibility
;
but
Hans
's
talk
naturally
fluttered
toward
mischief
,
and
he
was
given
to
a
form
of
experiment
on
live
animals
which
consisted
in
irritating
his
friends
playfully
.
<EOS>
His
experiments
had
ended
in
satisfying
him
that
what
he
thought
likely
was
true
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
any
susceptibility
Deronda
had
manifested
about
a
lover
's
attentions
being
shown
to
Mirah
,
Hans
took
to
be
sufficiently
accounted
for
by
the
alleged
reason
,
namely
,
her
dependent
position
;
for
he
credited
his
friend
with
all
possible
unselfish
anxiety
for
those
whom
he
could
rescue
and
protect
.
<EOS>
And
Deronda
's
insistence
that
Mirah
would
never
marry
one
who
was
not
a
Jew
necessarily
seemed
to
exclude
himself
,
since
Hans
shared
the
ordinary
opinion
,
which
he
knew
nothing
to
disturb
,
that
Deronda
was
the
son
of
Sir
Hugo
Mallinger
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
he
felt
himself
in
clearness
about
the
state
of
Deronda
's
affections
;
but
now
,
the
events
which
really
struck
him
as
concurring
toward
the
desirable
union
with
Mrs.
Grandcourt
,
had
called
forth
a
flash
of
revelation
from
Mirah
 
<EOS>
a
betrayal
of
her
passionate
feeling
on
this
subject
which
had
made
him
melancholy
on
her
account
as
well
as
his
own
 
yet
on
the
whole
less
melancholy
than
if
he
had
imagined
Deronda
's
hopes
fixed
on
her
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
sublime
,
but
it
is
common
,
for
a
man
to
see
the
beloved
object
unhappy
because
his
rival
loves
another
,
with
more
fortitude
and
a
milder
jealousy
than
if
he
saw
her
entirely
happy
in
his
rival
.
<EOS>
At
least
it
was
so
with
the
mercurial
Hans
,
who
fluctuated
between
the
contradictory
states
of
feeling
,
wounded
because
Mirah
was
wounded
,
and
of
being
almost
obliged
to
Deronda
for
loving
somebody
else
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
for
him
to
give
Mirah
any
direct
sign
of
the
way
in
which
he
had
understood
her
anger
,
yet
he
longed
that
his
speechless
companionship
should
be
eloquent
in
a
tender
,
penitent
sympathy
which
is
an
admissible
form
of
wooing
a
bruised
heart
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
the
two
went
side
by
side
in
a
companionship
that
yet
seemed
an
agitated
communication
,
like
that
of
two
chords
whose
quick
vibrations
lie
outside
our
hearing
.
<EOS>
But
when
they
reached
the
door
of
Mirah
's
home
,
and
Hans
said
"
Good
-
bye
,
"
putting
out
his
hand
with
an
appealing
look
of
penitence
,
she
met
the
look
with
melancholy
gentleness
,
and
said
,
"
Will
you
not
come
in
and
see
my
brother
?
"
  
<EOS>
Hans
could
not
but
interpret
this
invitation
as
a
sign
of
pardon
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
enough
understanding
of
what
Mirah
's
nature
had
been
wrought
into
by
her
early
experience
,
to
divine
how
the
very
strength
of
her
late
excitement
had
made
it
pass
more
quickly
into
the
resolute
acceptance
of
pain
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
said
,
"
If
you
will
let
me
,
"
and
they
went
in
together
,
half
his
grief
was
gone
,
and
he
was
spinning
a
little
romance
of
how
his
devotion
might
make
him
indispensable
to
Mirah
in
proportion
as
Deronda
gave
his
devotion
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
This
was
quite
fair
,
since
his
friend
was
provided
for
according
to
his
own
heart
;
and
on
the
question
of
Judaism
Hans
felt
thoroughly
fortified
:
 
who
ever
heard
in
tale
or
history
that
a
woman
's
love
went
in
the
track
of
her
race
and
religion
?
<EOS>
Moslem
and
Jewish
damsels
were
always
attracted
toward
Christians
,
and
now
if
Mirah
's
heart
had
gone
forth
too
precipitately
toward
Deronda
,
here
was
another
case
in
point
.
<EOS>
Hans
was
wo
nt
to
make
merry
with
his
own
arguments
,
to
call
himself
a
Giaour
,
and
antithesis
the
sole
clue
to
events
;
but
he
believed
a
little
in
what
he
laughed
at
.
<EOS>
And
thus
his
bird
-
like
hope
,
constructed
on
the
lightest
principles
,
soared
again
in
spite
of
heavy
circumstances
.
  
<EOS>
They
found
Mordecai
looking
singularly
happy
,
holding
a
closed
letter
in
his
hand
,
his
eyes
glowing
with
a
quiet
triumph
which
in
his
emaciated
face
gave
the
idea
of
a
conquest
over
assailing
death
.
<EOS>
After
the
greeting
between
him
and
Hans
,
Mirah
put
her
arm
<EOS>
round
her
brother
's
neck
and
looked
down
at
the
letter
in
his
hand
,
without
the
courage
to
ask
about
it
,
though
she
felt
sure
that
it
was
the
cause
of
his
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
letter
from
Daniel
Deronda
,
"
said
Mordecai
,
answering
her
look
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Brief
 
<EOS>
only
saying
that
he
hopes
soon
to
return
.
<EOS>
Unexpected
claims
have
detained
him
.
<EOS>
The
promise
of
seeing
him
again
is
like
the
bow
in
the
cloud
to
me
,
"
continued
Mordecai
,
looking
at
Hans
;
"
and
to
you
it
must
be
a
gladness
.
<EOS>
For
who
has
two
friends
like
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
While
Hans
was
answering
Mirah
slipped
away
to
her
own
room
;
but
not
to
indulge
in
any
outburst
of
the
passion
within
her
.
<EOS>
If
the
angels
,
once
supposed
to
watch
the
toilet
of
women
,
had
entered
the
little
chamber
with
her
and
let
her
shut
the
door
behind
them
,
they
would
only
have
seen
her
take
off
her
hat
,
sit
down
and
press
her
hands
against
her
temples
as
if
she
had
suddenly
reflected
that
her
head
ached
;
then
rise
to
dash
cold
water
on
her
eyes
and
brow
and
hair
till
her
backward
curls
were
full
of
crystal
beads
,
while
she
had
dried
her
brow
and
looked
out
like
a
freshly
-
opened
flower
from
among
the
dewy
tresses
of
the
woodland
;
then
give
deep
sighs
of
relief
,
and
putting
on
her
little
slippers
,
sit
still
after
that
action
for
a
couple
of
minutes
,
which
seemed
to
her
so
long
,
so
full
of
things
to
come
,
that
she
rose
with
an
air
of
recollection
,
and
went
down
to
make
tea
.
  
<EOS>
Something
of
the
old
life
had
returned
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
used
to
remember
that
she
must
learn
her
part
,
must
go
to
rehearsal
,
must
act
and
sing
in
the
evening
,
must
hide
her
feelings
from
her
father
;
and
the
more
painful
her
life
grew
,
the
more
she
had
been
used
to
hide
.
<EOS>
The
force
of
her
nature
had
long
found
its
chief
action
in
resolute
endurance
,
and
to
-
day
the
violence
of
feeling
which
had
caused
the
first
jet
of
anger
had
quickly
transformed
itself
into
a
steady
facing
of
trouble
,
the
well
-
known
companion
of
her
young
years
.
<EOS>
But
while
she
moved
about
and
spoke
as
usual
,
a
close
observer
might
have
discerned
a
difference
between
this
apparent
calm
,
which
was
the
effect
of
restraining
energy
,
and
the
sweet
genuine
calm
of
the
months
when
she
first
felt
a
return
of
her
infantine
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
Those
who
have
been
indulged
by
fortune
and
have
always
thought
of
calamity
as
what
happens
to
others
,
feel
a
blind
incredulous
rage
at
the
reversal
of
their
lot
,
and
half
believe
that
their
wild
cries
will
alter
the
course
of
the
storm
.
<EOS>
Mirah
felt
no
such
surprise
when
familiar
Sorrow
came
back
from
brief
absence
,
and
sat
down
with
her
according
to
the
old
use
and
wo
nt
.
<EOS>
And
this
habit
of
expecting
trouble
rather
than
joy
,
hindered
her
from
having
any
persistent
belief
in
opposition
to
the
probabilities
which
were
not
merely
suggested
by
Hans
,
but
were
supported
by
her
own
private
knowledge
and
long
-
growing
presentiment
.
<EOS>
An
attachment
between
Deronda
and
Mrs.
Grandcourt
,
to
end
in
their
future
marriage
,
had
the
aspect
of
a
certainty
for
her
feeling
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
no
fault
in
him
:
facts
had
ordered
themselves
so
that
there
was
a
tie
between
him
and
this
woman
who
belonged
to
another
world
than
hers
and
Ezra
's
 
nay
,
who
seemed
another
sort
of
being
than
Deronda
,
something
foreign
that
would
be
a
disturbance
in
his
life
instead
of
blending
with
it
.
<EOS>
Well
,
well
 
<EOS>
but
if
it
could
have
been
deferred
so
as
to
make
no
difference
while
Ezra
was
there
!
<EOS>
She
did
not
know
all
the
momentousness
of
the
relation
between
Deronda
and
her
brother
,
but
she
had
seen
,
and
instinctively
felt
enough
to
forebode
its
being
incongruous
with
any
close
tie
to
Mrs.
Grandcourt
;
at
least
this
was
the
clothing
that
Mirah
first
gave
to
her
mortal
repugnance
.
<EOS>
But
in
the
still
,
quick
action
of
her
consciousness
,
thoughts
went
on
like
changing
states
of
sensation
unbroken
by
her
habitual
acts
;
and
this
inward
language
soon
said
distinctly
that
the
mortal
repugnance
would
remain
even
if
Ezra
were
secured
from
loss
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
I
have
read
about
and
sung
about
and
seen
acted
,
is
happening
to
me
 
this
that
I
am
feeling
is
the
love
that
makes
jealousy
;
"
so
impartially
Mirah
summed
up
the
charge
against
herself
.
<EOS>
But
what
difference
could
this
pain
of
hers
make
to
any
one
else
?
<EOS>
It
must
remain
as
exclusively
her
own
,
and
hidden
,
as
her
early
yearning
and
devotion
to
her
lost
mother
.
<EOS>
But
unlike
that
devotion
,
it
was
something
that
she
felt
to
be
a
misfortune
of
her
nature
 
<EOS>
a
discovery
that
what
should
have
been
pure
gratitude
and
reverence
had
sunk
into
selfish
pain
,
that
the
feeling
she
had
hitherto
delighted
to
pour
out
in
words
was
degraded
into
something
she
was
ashamed
to
betray
 
an
absurd
longing
that
she
who
had
received
all
and
given
nothing
should
be
of
importance
where
she
was
of
no
importance
 
an
angry
feeling
toward
another
woman
who
possessed
the
good
she
wanted
.
<EOS>
But
what
notion
,
what
vain
reliance
could
it
be
that
had
lain
darkly
within
her
and
was
now
burning
itself
into
sight
as
disappointment
and
jealousy
?
<EOS>
It
was
as
if
her
soul
had
been
steeped
in
poisonous
passion
by
forgotten
dreams
of
deep
sleep
,
and
now
flamed
out
in
this
unaccountable
misery
.
<EOS>
For
with
her
waking
reason
she
had
never
entertained
what
seemed
the
wildly
unfitting
thought
that
Deronda
could
love
her
.
<EOS>
The
uneasiness
she
had
felt
before
had
been
comparatively
vague
and
easily
explained
as
part
of
a
general
regret
that
he
was
only
a
visitant
in
her
and
her
brother
's
world
,
from
which
the
world
where
his
home
lay
was
as
different
as
a
portico
with
lights
and
lacqueys
was
different
from
the
door
of
a
tent
,
where
the
only
splendor
came
from
the
mysterious
inaccessible
stars
.
<EOS>
But
her
feeling
was
no
longer
vague
:
the
cause
of
her
pain
 
<EOS>
the
image
of
Mrs.
Grandcourt
by
Deronda
's
side
,
drawing
him
farther
and
farther
into
the
distance
,
was
as
definite
as
pincers
on
her
flesh
.
<EOS>
In
the
Psyche
-
mould
of
Mirah
's
frame
there
rested
a
fervid
quality
of
emotion
,
sometimes
rashly
supposed
to
require
the
bulk
of
a
Cleopatra
;
her
impressions
had
the
thoroughness
and
tenacity
that
give
to
the
first
selection
of
passionate
feeling
the
character
of
a
lifelong
faithfulness
.
<EOS>
And
now
a
selection
had
declared
itself
,
which
gave
love
a
cruel
heart
of
jealousy
:
she
had
been
used
to
a
strong
repugnance
toward
certain
objects
that
surrounded
her
,
and
to
walk
inwardly
aloof
from
them
while
they
touched
her
sense
.
<EOS>
And
now
her
repugnance
concentrated
itself
on
Mrs.
Grandcourt
,
of
whom
she
involuntarily
conceived
more
evil
than
she
knew
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
bear
everything
that
used
to
be
 
<EOS>
but
this
is
worse
 
<EOS>
this
is
worse
,
 
<EOS>
I
used
not
to
have
horrible
feelings
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
poor
child
in
a
loud
whisper
to
her
pillow
.
<EOS>
Strange
that
she
should
have
to
pray
against
any
feeling
which
concerned
Deronda
!
  
<EOS>
But
this
conclusion
had
been
reached
through
an
evening
spent
in
attending
to
Mordecai
,
whose
exaltation
of
spirit
in
the
prospect
of
seeing
his
friend
again
,
disposed
him
to
utter
many
thoughts
aloud
to
Mirah
,
though
such
communication
was
often
interrupted
by
intervals
apparently
filled
with
an
inward
utterance
that
animated
his
eyes
and
gave
an
occasional
silent
action
to
his
lips
.
<EOS>
One
thought
especially
occupied
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Seest
thou
,
Mirah
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
once
,
after
a
long
silence
,
"
the
_
Shemah
_
,
wherein
we
briefly
confess
the
divine
Unity
,
is
the
chief
devotional
exercise
of
the
Hebrew
;
and
this
made
our
religion
the
fundamental
religion
for
the
whole
world
;
for
the
divine
Unity
embraced
as
its
consequence
the
ultimate
unity
of
mankind
.
<EOS>
See
,
then
 
the
nation
which
has
been
scoffed
at
for
its
separateness
,
has
given
a
binding
theory
to
the
human
race
.
<EOS>
Now
,
in
complete
unity
a
part
possesses
the
whole
as
the
whole
possesses
every
part
:
and
in
this
way
human
life
is
tending
toward
the
image
of
the
Supreme
Unity
:
for
as
our
life
becomes
more
spiritual
by
capacity
of
thought
,
and
joy
therein
,
possession
tends
to
become
more
universal
,
being
independent
of
gross
material
contact
;
so
that
in
a
brief
day
the
soul
of
man
may
know
in
fuller
volume
the
good
which
has
been
and
is
,
nay
,
is
to
come
,
than
all
he
could
possess
in
a
whole
life
where
he
had
to
follow
the
creeping
paths
of
the
senses
.
<EOS>
In
this
moment
,
my
sister
,
I
hold
the
joy
of
another
's
future
within
me
:
a
future
which
these
eyes
will
not
see
,
and
which
my
spirit
may
not
then
recognize
as
mine
.
<EOS>
I
recognize
it
now
,
and
love
it
so
,
that
I
can
lay
down
this
poor
life
upon
its
altar
and
say
:
"
Burn
,
burn
indiscernibly
into
that
which
shall
be
,
which
is
my
love
and
not
me
.
"
<EOS>
Dost
thou
understand
,
Mirah
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
little
,
"
said
Mirah
,
faintly
,
"
but
my
mind
is
too
poor
to
have
felt
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
yet
,
"
said
Mordecai
,
rather
insistently
,
"
women
are
specially
framed
for
the
love
which
feels
possession
in
renouncing
,
and
is
thus
a
fit
image
of
what
I
mean
.
<EOS>
Somewhere
in
the
later
_
Midrash
_
,
I
think
,
is
the
story
of
a
Jewish
maiden
who
loved
a
Gentile
king
so
well
,
that
this
was
what
she
did
:
 
<EOS>
she
entered
into
prison
and
changed
clothes
with
the
woman
who
was
beloved
by
the
king
,
that
she
might
deliver
that
woman
from
death
by
dying
in
her
stead
,
and
leave
the
king
to
be
happy
in
his
love
which
was
not
for
her
.
<EOS>
This
is
the
surpassing
love
,
that
loses
self
in
the
object
of
love
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
Ezra
,
no
,
"
said
Mirah
,
with
low
-
toned
intensity
,
"
that
was
not
it
.
<EOS>
She
wanted
the
king
when
she
was
dead
to
know
what
she
had
done
,
and
feel
that
she
was
better
than
the
other
.
<EOS>
It
was
her
strong
self
,
wanting
to
conquer
,
that
made
her
die
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mordecai
was
silent
a
little
,
and
then
argued
    
"
That
might
be
,
Mirah
.
<EOS>
But
if
she
acted
so
,
believing
the
king
would
never
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
make
the
story
so
in
your
mind
,
Ezra
,
because
you
are
great
,
and
like
to
fancy
the
greatest
that
could
be
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
it
was
not
really
like
that
.
<EOS>
The
Jewish
girl
must
have
had
jealousy
in
her
heart
,
and
she
wanted
somehow
to
have
the
first
place
in
the
king
's
mind
.
<EOS>
That
is
what
she
would
die
for
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
sister
,
thou
hast
read
too
many
plays
,
where
the
writers
delight
in
showing
the
human
passions
as
indwelling
demons
,
unmixed
with
the
relenting
and
devout
elements
of
the
soul
.
<EOS>
Thou
judgest
by
the
plays
,
and
not
by
thy
own
heart
,
which
is
like
our
mother
's
.

Mirah
made
no
answer

Something
which
Mirah
had
lately
been
watching
for
as
the
fulfilment
of
a
threat
,
seemed
now
the
continued
visit
of
that
familiar
sorrow
which
had
lately
come
back
,
bringing
abundant
luggage
.
  
<EOS>
Turning
out
of
Knightsbridge
,
after
singing
at
a
charitable
morning
concert
in
a
wealthy
house
,
where
she
had
been
recommended
by
Klesmer
,
and
where
there
had
been
the
usual
groups
outside
to
see
the
departing
company
,
she
began
to
feel
herself
dogged
by
footsteps
that
kept
an
even
pace
with
her
own
.
<EOS>
Her
concert
dress
being
simple
black
,
over
which
she
had
thrown
a
dust
cloak
,
could
not
make
her
an
object
of
unpleasant
attention
,
and
render
walking
an
imprudence
;
but
this
reflection
did
not
occur
to
Mirah
:
another
kind
of
alarm
lay
uppermost
in
her
mind
.
<EOS>
She
immediately
thought
of
her
father
,
and
could
no
more
look
round
than
if
she
had
felt
herself
tracked
by
a
ghost
.
<EOS>
To
turn
and
face
him
would
be
voluntarily
to
meet
the
rush
of
emotions
which
beforehand
seemed
intolerable
.
<EOS>
If
it
were
her
father
he
must
mean
to
claim
recognition
,
and
he
would
oblige
her
to
face
him
.
<EOS>
She
must
wait
for
that
compulsion
.
<EOS>
She
walked
on
,
not
quickening
her
pace
 
of
what
use
was
that
?
 
<EOS>
but
picturing
what
was
about
to
happen
as
if
she
had
the
full
certainty
that
the
man
behind
her
was
her
father
;
and
along
with
her
picturing
went
a
regret
that
she
had
given
her
word
to
Mrs.
Meyrick
not
to
use
any
concealment
about
him
.
<EOS>
The
regret
at
last
urged
her
,
at
least
,
to
try
and
hinder
any
sudden
betrayal
that
would
cause
her
brother
an
unnecessary
shock
.
<EOS>
Under
the
pressure
of
this
motive
,
she
resolved
to
turn
before
she
reached
her
own
door
,
and
firmly
will
the
encounter
instead
of
merely
submitting
to
it
.
<EOS>
She
had
already
reached
the
entrance
of
the
small
square
where
her
home
lay
,
and
had
made
up
her
mind
to
turn
,
when
she
felt
her
embodied
presentiment
getting
closer
to
her
,
then
slipping
to
her
side
,
grasping
her
wrist
,
and
saying
,
with
a
persuasive
curl
of
accent
,
"
Mirah
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
paused
at
once
without
any
start
;
it
was
the
voice
she
expected
,
and
she
was
meeting
the
expected
eyes
.
<EOS>
Her
face
was
as
grave
as
if
she
had
been
looking
at
her
executioner
,
while
his
was
adjusted
to
the
intention
of
soothing
and
propitiating
her
.
<EOS>
Once
a
handsome
face
,
with
bright
color
,
it
was
now
sallow
and
deep
-
lined
,
and
had
that
peculiar
impress
of
impudent
suavity
which
comes
from
courting
favor
while
accepting
disrespect
.
<EOS>
He
was
lightly
made
and
active
,
with
something
of
youth
about
him
which
made
the
signs
of
age
seem
a
disguise
;
and
in
reality
he
was
hardly
fifty
-
seven
.
<EOS>
His
dress
was
shabby
,
as
when
she
had
seen
him
before
.
<EOS>
The
presence
of
this
unreverend
father
now
,
more
than
ever
,
affected
Mirah
with
the
mingled
anguish
of
shame
and
grief
,
repulsion
and
pity
 
more
than
ever
,
now
that
her
own
world
was
changed
into
one
where
there
was
no
comradeship
to
fence
him
from
scorn
and
contempt
.
  
<EOS>
Slowly
,
with
a
sad
,
tremulous
voice
,
she
said
,
"
It
is
you
,
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
did
you
run
away
from
me
,
child
?
"
<EOS>
he
began
with
rapid
speech
which
was
meant
to
have
a
tone
of
tender
remonstrance
,
accompanied
with
various
quick
gestures
like
an
abbreviated
finger
-
language
.
<EOS>
"
What
were
you
afraid
of
?
<EOS>
You
knew
I
never
made
you
do
anything
against
your
will
.
<EOS>
It
was
for
your
sake
I
broke
up
your
engagement
in
the
Vorstadt
,
because
I
saw
it
did
n't
suit
you
,
and
you
repaid
me
by
leaving
me
to
the
bad
times
that
came
in
consequence
.
<EOS>
I
had
made
an
easier
engagement
for
you
at
the
Vorstadt
Theater
in
Dresden
:
I
did
n't
tell
you
,
because
I
wanted
to
take
you
by
surprise
.
<EOS>
And
you
left
me
planted
there
 
<EOS>
obliged
to
make
myself
scarce
because
I
had
broken
contract
.
<EOS>
That
was
hard
lines
for
me
,
after
I
had
given
up
everything
for
the
sake
of
getting
you
an
education
which
was
to
be
a
fortune
to
you
.
<EOS>
What
father
devoted
himself
to
his
daughter
more
than
I
did
to
you
?
<EOS>
You
know
how
I
bore
that
disappointment
in
your
voice
,
and
made
the
best
of
it
:
<EOS>
and
when
I
had
nobody
besides
you
,
and
was
getting
broken
,
as
a
man
must
who
has
had
to
fight
his
way
with
his
brains
 
<EOS>
you
chose
that
time
to
leave
me
.
<EOS>
Who
else
was
it
you
owed
everything
to
,
if
not
to
me
?
<EOS>
and
where
was
your
feeling
in
return
?
<EOS>
For
what
my
daughter
cared
,
I
might
have
died
in
a
ditch
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lapidoth
stopped
short
here
,
not
from
lack
of
invention
,
but
because
he
had
reached
a
pathetic
climax
,
and
gave
a
sudden
sob
,
like
a
woman
's
,
taking
out
hastily
an
old
yellow
silk
handkerchief
.
<EOS>
He
really
felt
that
his
daughter
had
treated
him
ill
 
a
sort
of
sensibility
which
is
naturally
strong
in
unscrupulous
persons
,
who
put
down
what
is
owing
to
them
,
without
any
_
per
contra
_
.
<EOS>
Mirah
,
in
spite
of
that
sob
,
had
energy
enough
not
to
let
him
suppose
that
he
deceived
her
.
<EOS>
She
answered
more
firmly
,
though
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
used
accusing
words
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
why
I
left
you
,
father
;
and
I
had
reason
to
distrust
you
,
because
I
felt
sure
that
you
had
deceived
my
mother
.
<EOS>
If
I
could
have
trusted
you
,
I
would
have
stayed
with
you
and
worked
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
meant
to
deceive
your
mother
,
Mirah
,
"
said
Lapidoth
,
putting
back
his
handkerchief
,
but
beginning
with
a
voice
that
seemed
to
struggle
against
further
sobbing
.
<EOS>
"
I
meant
to
take
you
back
to
her
,
but
chances
hindered
me
just
at
the
time
,
and
then
there
came
information
of
her
death
.
<EOS>
It
was
better
for
you
that
I
should
stay
where
I
was
,
and
your
brother
could
take
care
of
himself
.
<EOS>
Nobody
had
any
claim
on
me
<EOS>
but
you
.
<EOS>
I
had
word
of
your
mother
's
death
from
a
particular
friend
,
who
had
undertaken
to
manage
things
for
me
,
and
I
sent
him
over
money
to
pay
expenses
.
<EOS>
There
's
one
chance
to
be
sure
 
"
Lapidoth
had
quickly
conceived
that
he
must
guard
against
something
unlikely
,
yet
possible
 
<EOS>
"
he
may
have
written
me
lies
for
the
sake
of
getting
the
money
out
of
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mirah
made
no
answer
;
she
could
not
bear
to
utter
the
only
true
one
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
one
word
of
what
you
say
"
 
and
she
simply
showed
a
wish
that
they
should
walk
on
,
feeling
that
their
standing
still
might
draw
down
unpleasant
notice
.
<EOS>
Even
as
they
walked
along
,
their
companionship
might
well
have
made
a
passer
-
by
turn
back
to
look
at
them
.
<EOS>
The
figure
of
Mirah
,
with
her
beauty
set
off
by
the
quiet
,
careful
dress
of
an
English
lady
,
made
a
strange
pendant
to
this
shabby
,
foreign
-
looking
,
eager
,
and
gesticulating
man
,
who
withal
had
an
ineffaceable
jauntiness
of
air
,
perhaps
due
to
the
bushy
curls
of
his
grizzled
hair
,
the
smallness
of
his
hands
and
feet
,
and
his
light
walk
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
seem
to
have
done
well
for
yourself
,
Mirah
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
You
_
are
in
no
want
,
I
see
,
"
said
the
father
,
looking
at
her
with
emphatic
examination
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
friends
who
found
me
in
distress
have
helped
me
to
get
work
,
"
said
Mirah
,
hardly
knowing
what
she
actually
said
,
from
being
occupied
with
what
she
would
presently
have
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
give
lessons
.
<EOS>
I
have
sung
in
private
houses
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
been
singing
at
a
private
concert
.
"
<EOS>
She
paused
,
and
then
added
,
with
significance
,
"
I
have
very
good
friends
,
who
know
all
about
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
would
be
ashamed
they
should
see
your
father
in
this
plight
?
<EOS>
No
wonder
.
<EOS>
I
came
to
England
with
no
prospect
,
but
the
chance
of
finding
you
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
mad
quest
;
but
a
father
's
heart
is
superstitious
 
<EOS>
feels
a
loadstone
drawing
it
somewhere
or
other
.
<EOS>
I
might
have
done
very
well
,
staying
abroad
:
when
I
had
n't
you
to
take
care
of
,
I
could
have
rolled
or
settled
as
easily
as
a
ball
;
but
it
's
hard
being
lonely
in
the
world
,
when
your
spirit
's
beginning
to
break
.
<EOS>
And
I
thought
my
little
Mirah
would
repent
leaving
her
father
when
she
came
to
look
back
.
<EOS>
I
've
had
a
sharp
pinch
to
work
my
way
;
I
do
n't
know
what
I
shall
come
down
to
next
.
<EOS>
Talents
like
mine
are
no
use
in
this
country
.
<EOS>
When
a
man
's
getting
out
at
elbows
nobody
will
believe
in
him
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
get
any
decent
employ
with
my
appearance
.
<EOS>
I
've
been
obliged
to
get
pretty
low
for
a
shilling
already
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mirah
's
anxiety
was
quick
enough
to
imagine
her
father
's
sinking
into
a
further
degradation
,
which
she
was
bound
to
hinder
if
she
could
.
<EOS>
But
before
she
could
answer
his
string
of
inventive
sentences
,
delivered
with
as
much
glibness
as
if
they
had
been
learned
by
rote
,
he
added
promptly
    
"
Where
do
you
live
,
Mirah
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Here
,
in
this
square
.
<EOS>
We
are
not
far
from
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
In
lodgings
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Any
one
to
take
care
of
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Mirah
again
,
looking
full
at
the
keen
face
which
was
turned
toward
hers
 
"
my
brother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
father
's
eyelids
fluttered
as
if
the
lightning
had
come
across
them
,
and
there
was
a
slight
movement
of
the
shoulders
.
<EOS>
But
he
said
,
after
a
just
perceptible
pause
:
"
Ezra
?
<EOS>
How
did
you
know
 
<EOS>
how
did
you
find
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
would
take
long
to
tell
.
<EOS>
Here
we
are
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
My
brother
would
not
wish
me
to
close
it
on
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mirah
was
already
on
the
doorstep
,
but
had
her
face
turned
toward
her
father
,
who
stood
below
her
on
the
pavement
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
had
begun
to
beat
faster
with
the
prospect
of
what
was
coming
in
the
presence
of
Ezra
;
and
already
in
this
attitude
of
giving
leave
to
the
father
whom
she
had
been
used
to
obey
 
in
this
sight
of
him
standing
below
her
,
with
a
perceptible
shrinking
from
the
admission
which
he
had
been
indirectly
asking
for
,
she
had
a
pang
of
the
peculiar
,
sympathetic
humiliation
and
shame
 
<EOS>
the
stabbed
heart
of
reverence
 
which
belongs
to
a
nature
intensely
filial
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stay
a
minute
,
_
Liebchen
_
,
"
said
Lapidoth
,
speaking
in
a
lowered
tone
;
"
what
sort
of
man
has
Ezra
turned
out
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
good
man
 
a
wonderful
man
,
"
said
Mirah
,
with
slow
emphasis
,
trying
to
master
the
agitation
which
made
her
voice
more
tremulous
as
she
went
on
.
<EOS>
She
felt
urged
to
prepare
her
father
for
the
complete
penetration
of
himself
which
awaited
him
.
"
<EOS>
But
he
was
very
poor
when
my
friends
found
him
for
me
 
a
poor
workman
.
<EOS>
Once
 
twelve
years
ago
 
he
was
strong
and
happy
,
going
to
the
East
,
which
he
loved
to
think
of
;
and
my
mother
called
him
back
because
 
because
she
had
lost
me
.
<EOS>
And
he
went
to
her
,
and
took
care
of
her
through
great
trouble
,
and
worked
for
her
till
she
died
 
died
in
grief
.
<EOS>
And
Ezra
,
too
,
had
lost
his
health
and
strength
.
<EOS>
The
cold
had
seized
him
coming
back
to
my
mother
,
because
she
was
forsaken
.
<EOS>
For
years
he
has
been
getting
weaker
 
<EOS>
always
poor
,
always
working
 
but
full
of
knowledge
,
and
great
-
minded
.
<EOS>
All
who
come
near
him
honor
him
.
<EOS>
To
stand
before
him
is
like
standing
before
a
prophet
of
God
"
 
Mirah
ended
with
difficulty
,
her
heart
throbbing
 
"
falsehoods
are
no
use
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
had
cast
down
her
eyes
that
she
might
not
see
her
father
while
she
spoke
the
last
words
 
unable
to
bear
the
ignoble
look
of
frustration
that
gathered
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
none
the
less
quick
in
invention
and
decision
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mirah
,
_
Liebchen
_
,
"
he
said
,
in
the
old
caressing
way
,
"
should
n't
you
like
me
to
make
myself
a
little
more
respectable
before
my
son
sees
me
?
<EOS>
If
I
had
a
little
sum
of
money
,
I
could
fit
myself
out
and
come
home
to
you
as
your
father
ought
,
and
then
I
could
offer
myself
for
some
decent
place
.
<EOS>
With
a
good
shirt
and
coat
on
my
back
,
people
would
be
glad
enough
to
have
me
.
<EOS>
I
could
offer
myself
for
a
courier
,
if
I
did
n't
look
like
a
broken
-
down
mountebank
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
be
with
my
children
,
and
forget
and
forgive
.
<EOS>
But
you
have
never
seen
your
father
look
like
this
before
.
<EOS>
If
you
had
ten
pounds
at
hand
 
<EOS>
or
I
could
appoint
you
to
bring
it
me
somewhere
 
<EOS>
I
could
fit
myself
out
by
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mirah
felt
herself
under
a
temptation
which
she
must
try
to
overcome
.
<EOS>
She
answered
,
obliging
herself
to
look
at
him
again
    
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
like
to
deny
you
what
you
ask
,
father
;
but
I
have
given
a
promise
not
to
do
things
for
you
in
secret
.
<EOS>
It
_
is
_
hard
to
see
you
looking
needy
;
but
we
will
bear
that
for
a
little
while
;
and
then
you
can
have
new
clothes
,
and
we
can
pay
for
them
.
"
<EOS>
Her
practical
sense
made
her
see
now
what
was
Mrs.
Meyrick
's
wisdom
in
exacting
a
promise
from
her
.
  
<EOS>
Lapidoth
's
good
humor
gave
way
a
little
.
<EOS>
He
said
,
with
a
sneer
,
"
You
are
a
hard
and
fast
young
lady
 
you
have
been
learning
useful
virtues
 
<EOS>
keeping
promises
not
to
help
your
father
with
a
pound
or
two
when
you
are
getting
money
to
dress
yourself
in
silk
 
your
father
who
made
an
idol
of
you
,
and
gave
up
the
best
part
of
his
life
to
providing
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
seems
cruel
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
seems
cruel
,
"
said
Mirah
,
feeling
this
a
worse
moment
than
when
she
meant
to
drown
herself
.
<EOS>
Her
lips
were
suddenly
pale
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
father
,
it
is
more
cruel
to
break
the
promises
people
trust
in
.
<EOS>
That
broke
my
mother
's
heart
 
<EOS>
it
has
broken
Ezra
's
life
.
<EOS>
You
and
I
must
eat
now
this
bitterness
from
what
has
been
.
<EOS>
Bear
it
.
<EOS>
Bear
to
come
in
and
be
cared
for
as
you
are
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
-
morrow
,
then
,
"
said
Lapidoth
,
almost
turning
on
his
heel
away
from
this
pale
,
trembling
daughter
,
who
seemed
now
to
have
got
the
inconvenient
world
to
back
her
;
but
he
quickly
turned
on
it
again
,
with
his
hands
feeling
about
restlessly
in
his
pockets
,
and
said
,
with
some
return
to
his
appealing
tone
,
"
I
'm
a
little
cut
up
with
all
this
,
Mirah
.
<EOS>
I
shall
get
up
my
spirits
by
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
If
you
've
a
little
money
in
your
pocket
,
I
suppose
it
is
n't
against
your
promise
to
give
me
a
trifle
 
to
buy
a
cigar
with
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mirah
could
not
ask
herself
another
question
 
could
not
do
anything
else
than
put
her
cold
trembling
hands
in
her
pocket
for
her
_
portemonnaie
_
and
hold
it
out
.
<EOS>
Lapidoth
grasped
it
at
once
,
pressed
her
fingers
the
while
,
said
,
"
Good
-
bye
,
my
little
girl
 
to
-
morrow
then
!
"
and
left
her
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
taken
many
steps
before
he
looked
carefully
into
all
the
folds
of
the
purse
,
found
two
half
-
sovereigns
and
odd
silver
,
and
,
pasted
against
the
folding
cover
,
a
bit
of
paper
on
which
Ezra
had
inscribed
,
in
a
beautiful
Hebrew
character
,
the
name
of
his
mother
,
the
days
of
her
birth
,
marriage
,
and
death
,
and
the
prayer
,
"
May
Mirah
be
delivered
from
evil
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
Mirah
's
liking
to
have
this
little
inscription
on
many
articles
that
she
used
.
<EOS>
The
father
read
it
,
and
had
a
quick
vision
of
his
marriage
day
,
and
the
bright
,
unblamed
young
fellow
he
was
at
that
time
;
teaching
many
things
,
but
expecting
by
-
and
-
by
to
get
money
more
easily
by
writing
;
and
very
fond
of
his
beautiful
bride
<EOS>
Sara
 
crying
when
she
expected
him
to
cry
,
and
reflecting
every
phase
of
her
feeling
with
mimetic
susceptibility
.
<EOS>
Lapidoth
had
traveled
a
long
way
from
that
young
self
,
and
thought
of
all
that
this
inscription
signified
with
an
unemotional
memory
,
which
was
like
the
ocular
perception
of
a
touch
to
one
who
has
lost
the
sense
of
touch
,
or
like
morsels
on
an
untasting
palate
,
having
shape
and
grain
,
but
no
flavor
.
<EOS>
Among
the
things
we
may
gamble
away
in
a
lazy
selfish
life
is
the
capacity
for
ruth
,
compunction
,
or
any
unselfish
regret
 
which
we
may
come
to
long
for
as
one
in
slow
death
longs
to
feel
laceration
,
rather
than
be
conscious
of
a
widening
margin
where
consciousness
once
was
.
<EOS>
Mirah
's
purse
was
a
handsome
one
 
a
gift
to
her
,
which
she
had
been
unable
to
reflect
about
giving
away
 
and
Lapidoth
presently
found
himself
outside
of
his
reverie
,
considering
what
the
purse
would
fetch
in
addition
to
the
sum
it
contained
,
and
what
prospect
there
was
of
his
being
able
to
get
more
from
his
daughter
without
submitting
to
adopt
a
penitential
form
of
life
under
the
eyes
of
that
formidable
son
.
<EOS>
On
such
a
subject
his
susceptibilities
were
still
lively
.
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
Mirah
had
entered
the
house
with
her
power
of
reticence
overcome
by
the
cruelty
of
her
pain
.
<EOS>
She
found
her
brother
quietly
reading
and
sifting
old
manuscripts
of
his
own
,
which
he
meant
to
consign
to
Deronda
.
<EOS>
In
the
reaction
from
the
long
effort
to
master
herself
,
she
fell
down
before
him
and
clasped
his
knees
,
sobbing
,
and
crying
,
"
Ezra
,
Ezra
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
did
not
speak
.
<EOS>
His
alarm
for
her
spending
itself
on
conceiving
the
cause
of
her
distress
,
the
more
striking
from
the
novelty
in
her
of
this
violent
manifestation
.
<EOS>
But
Mirah
's
own
longing
was
to
be
able
to
speak
and
tell
him
the
cause
.
<EOS>
Presently
she
raised
her
hand
,
and
still
sobbing
,
said
brokenly
    
"
Ezra
,
my
father
!
<EOS>
our
father
!
<EOS>
He
followed
me
.
<EOS>
I
wanted
him
to
come
in
.
<EOS>
I
said
you
would
let
him
come
in
.
<EOS>
And
he
said
<EOS>
No
,
he
would
not
 
not
now
,
but
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
And
he
begged
for
money
from
me
.
<EOS>
And
I
gave
him
my
purse
,
and
he
went
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mirah
's
words
seemed
to
herself
to
express
all
the
misery
she
felt
in
them
.
<EOS>
Her
brother
found
them
less
grievous
than
his
preconceptions
,
and
said
gently
,
"
Wait
for
calm
,
Mirah
,
and
then
tell
me
all
,
"
 
putting
off
her
hat
and
laying
his
hands
tenderly
on
her
head
.
<EOS>
She
felt
the
soothing
influence
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
told
him
as
exactly
as
she
could
all
that
had
happened
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
not
come
to
-
morrow
,
"
said
Mordecai
.
<EOS>
Neither
of
them
said
to
the
other
what
they
both
thought
,
namely
,
that
he
might
watch
for
Mirah
's
outgoings
and
beg
from
her
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Seest
thou
,
"
he
presently
added
,
"
our
lot
is
the
lot
of
Israel
.
<EOS>
The
grief
and
the
glory
are
mingled
as
the
smoke
and
the
flame
.
<EOS>
It
is
because
we
children
have
inherited
the
good
that
we
feel
the
evil
.
<EOS>
These
things
are
wedded
for
us
,
as
our
father
was
wedded
to
our
mother
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
surroundings
were
of
Brompton
,
but
the
voice
might
have
come
from
a
Rabbi
transmitting
the
sentences
of
an
elder
time
to
be
registered
in
_
Babli
_
 
<EOS>
by
which
(
to
our
ears
)
affectionate
-
sounding
diminutive
is
meant
the
voluminous
Babylonian
Talmud
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Omnipresent
,
"
said
a
Rabbi
,
"
is
occupied
in
making
marriages
.
<EOS>
"
The
levity
of
the
saying
lies
in
the
ear
of
him
who
hears
it
;
for
by
marriages
the
speaker
meant
all
the
wondrous
combinations
of
the
universe
whose
issue
makes
our
good
and
evil
.

<EOS>
_
Gestandnisse

<EOS>
Imagine
the
difference
in
Deronda
's
state
of
mind
when
he
left
England
and
when
he
returned
to
it
.
<EOS>
He
had
set
out
for
Genoa
in
total
uncertainty
how
far
the
actual
bent
of
his
wishes
and
affections
would
be
encouraged
 
<EOS>
how
far
the
claims
revealed
to
him
might
draw
him
into
new
paths
,
far
away
from
the
tracks
his
thoughts
had
lately
been
pursuing
with
a
consent
of
desire
which
uncertainty
made
dangerous
.
<EOS>
He
came
back
with
something
like
a
discovered
charter
warranting
the
inherited
right
that
his
ambition
had
begun
to
yearn
for
:
he
came
back
with
what
was
better
than
freedom
 
with
a
duteous
bond
which
his
experience
had
been
preparing
him
to
accept
gladly
,
even
if
it
had
been
attended
with
no
promise
of
satisfying
a
secret
passionate
longing
never
yet
allowed
to
grow
into
a
hope
.
<EOS>
But
now
he
dared
avow
to
himself
the
hidden
selection
of
his
love
.
<EOS>
Since
the
hour
when
he
left
the
house
at
Chelsea
in
full
-
hearted
silence
under
the
effect
of
Mirah
's
farewell
look
and
words
 
their
exquisite
appealingness
stirring
in
him
that
deep
-
laid
care
for
womanhood
which
had
begun
when
his
own
lip
was
like
a
girl
's
 
her
hold
on
his
feeling
had
helped
him
to
be
blameless
in
word
and
deed
under
the
difficult
circumstances
we
know
of
.
<EOS>
There
seemed
no
likelihood
that
he
could
ever
woo
this
creature
who
had
become
dear
to
him
amidst
associations
that
forbade
wooing
;
yet
she
had
taken
her
place
in
his
soul
as
a
beloved
type
 
reducing
the
power
of
other
fascination
and
making
a
difference
in
it
that
became
deficiency
.
<EOS>
The
influence
had
been
continually
strengthened
.
<EOS>
It
had
lain
in
the
course
of
poor
Gwendolen
's
lot
that
her
dependence
on
Deronda
tended
to
rouse
in
him
the
enthusiasm
of
self
-
martyring
pity
rather
than
of
personal
love
,
and
his
less
constrained
tenderness
flowed
with
the
fuller
stream
toward
an
indwelling
image
in
all
things
unlike
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
Still
more
,
his
relation
to
Mordecai
had
brought
with
it
a
new
nearness
to
Mirah
which
was
not
the
less
agitating
because
there
was
no
apparent
change
in
his
position
toward
her
;
and
she
had
inevitably
been
bound
up
in
all
the
thoughts
that
made
him
shrink
from
an
issue
disappointing
to
her
brother
.
<EOS>
This
process
had
not
gone
on
unconsciously
in
Deronda
:
he
was
conscious
of
it
as
we
are
of
some
covetousness
that
it
would
be
better
to
nullify
by
encouraging
other
thoughts
than
to
give
it
the
insistency
of
confession
even
to
ourselves
:
but
the
jealous
fire
had
leaped
out
at
Hans
's
pretensions
,
and
when
his
mother
accused
him
of
being
in
love
with
a
Jewess
any
evasion
suddenly
seemed
an
infidelity
.
<EOS>
His
mother
had
compelled
him
to
a
decisive
acknowledgment
of
his
love
,
as
Joseph
Kalonymos
had
compelled
him
to
a
definite
expression
of
his
resolve
.
<EOS>
This
new
state
of
decision
wrought
on
Deronda
with
a
force
which
surprised
even
himself
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
release
of
all
the
energy
which
had
long
been
spent
in
self
-
checking
and
suppression
because
of
doubtful
conditions
;
and
he
was
ready
to
laugh
at
his
own
impetuosity
<EOS>
when
,
as
he
neared
England
on
his
way
from
Mainz
,
he
felt
the
remaining
distance
more
and
more
of
an
obstruction
.
<EOS>
It
was
as
if
he
had
found
an
added
soul
in
finding
his
ancestry
 
his
judgment
no
longer
wandering
in
the
mazes
of
impartial
sympathy
,
but
choosing
,
with
that
partiality
which
is
man
's
best
strength
,
the
closer
fellowship
that
makes
sympathy
practical
 
exchanging
that
bird
's
eye
reasonableness
which
soars
to
avoid
preference
and
loses
all
sense
of
quality
for
the
generous
reasonableness
of
drawing
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
men
of
like
inheritance
.
<EOS>
He
wanted
now
to
be
again
with
Mordecai
,
to
pour
forth
instead
of
restraining
his
feeling
,
to
admit
agreement
and
maintain
dissent
,
and
all
the
while
to
find
Mirah
's
presence
without
the
embarrassment
of
obviously
seeking
it
,
to
see
her
in
the
light
of
a
new
possibility
,
to
interpret
her
looks
and
words
from
a
new
starting
-
point
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
greatly
alarmed
about
the
effect
of
Hans
's
attentions
,
but
he
had
a
presentiment
that
her
feeling
toward
himself
had
from
the
first
lain
in
a
channel
from
which
it
was
not
likely
to
be
diverted
into
love
.
<EOS>
To
astonish
a
woman
by
turning
into
her
lover
when
she
has
been
thinking
of
you
merely
as
a
Lord
Chancellor
is
what
a
man
naturally
shrinks
from
<EOS>
:
he
is
anxious
to
create
an
easier
transition
.
  
<EOS>
What
wonder
that
Deronda
saw
no
other
course
than
to
go
straight
from
the
London
railway
station
to
the
lodgings
in
that
small
square
in
Brompton
?
<EOS>
Every
argument
was
in
favor
of
his
losing
no
time
.
<EOS>
He
had
promised
to
run
down
the
next
day
to
see
Lady
Mallinger
at
the
Abbey
,
and
it
was
already
sunset
.
<EOS>
He
wished
to
deposit
the
precious
chest
with
Mordecai
,
who
would
study
its
contents
,
both
in
his
absence
and
in
company
with
him
;
and
that
he
should
pay
this
visit
without
pause
would
gratify
Mordecai
's
heart
.
<EOS>
Hence
,
and
for
other
reasons
,
it
gratified
Deronda
's
heart
.
<EOS>
The
strongest
tendencies
of
his
nature
were
rushing
in
one
current
 
the
fervent
affectionateness
which
made
him
delight
in
meeting
the
wish
of
beings
near
to
him
,
and
the
imaginative
need
of
some
far
-
reaching
relation
to
make
the
horizon
of
his
immediate
,
daily
acts
.
<EOS>
It
has
to
be
admitted
that
in
this
classical
,
romantic
,
world
-
historic
position
of
his
,
bringing
as
it
were
from
its
hiding
-
place
his
hereditary
armor
,
he
wore
 
<EOS>
but
so
,
one
must
suppose
,
did
the
most
ancient
heroes
,
<EOS>
whether
Semitic
or
Japhetic
 
the
summer
costume
of
his
contemporaries
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
reflect
that
the
drab
tints
were
becoming
to
him
,
for
he
rarely
went
to
the
expense
of
such
thinking
;
but
his
own
depth
of
coloring
,
which
made
the
becomingness
,
got
an
added
radiance
in
the
eyes
,
a
fleeting
and
returning
glow
in
the
skin
,
as
he
entered
the
house
wondering
what
exactly
he
should
find
.
<EOS>
He
made
his
entrance
as
noiseless
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
evening
of
that
same
afternoon
on
which
Mirah
had
had
the
interview
with
her
father
.
<EOS>
Mordecai
,
penetrated
by
her
grief
,
and
also
the
sad
memories
which
the
incident
had
awakened
,
had
not
resumed
his
task
of
sifting
papers
:
some
of
them
had
fallen
scattered
on
the
floor
in
the
first
moments
of
anxiety
,
and
neither
he
nor
Mirah
had
thought
of
laying
them
in
order
again
.
<EOS>
They
had
sat
perfectly
still
together
,
not
knowing
how
long
;
while
the
clock
ticked
on
the
mantelpiece
,
and
the
light
was
fading
,
Mirah
,
unable
to
think
of
the
food
that
she
ought
to
have
been
taking
,
had
not
moved
since
she
had
thrown
off
her
dust
-
cloak
and
sat
down
beside
Mordecai
with
her
hand
in
his
,
while
he
had
laid
his
head
backward
,
with
closed
eyes
and
difficult
breathing
,
looking
,
Mirah
thought
,
as
he
would
look
when
the
soul
within
him
could
no
longer
live
in
its
straitened
home
.
<EOS>
The
thought
that
his
death
might
be
near
was
continually
visiting
her
when
she
saw
his
face
in
this
way
,
without
its
vivid
animation
;
and
now
,
to
the
rest
of
her
grief
,
was
added
the
regret
that
she
had
been
unable
to
control
the
violent
outburst
which
had
shaken
him
.
<EOS>
She
sat
watching
him
 
her
oval
cheeks
pallid
,
<EOS>
her
eyes
with
the
sorrowful
brilliancy
left
by
young
tears
,
her
curls
in
as
much
disorder
as
a
just
-
awakened
child
's
 
watching
<EOS>
that
emaciated
face
,
where
it
might
have
been
imagined
that
a
veil
had
been
drawn
never
to
be
lifted
,
as
if
it
were
her
dead
joy
which
had
left
her
strong
enough
to
live
on
in
sorrow
.
<EOS>
And
life
at
that
moment
stretched
before
Mirah
with
more
than
a
repetition
of
former
sadness
.
<EOS>
The
shadow
of
the
father
was
there
,
and
more
than
that
,
a
double
bereavement
 
of
one
living
as
well
as
one
dead
.
  
<EOS>
But
now
the
door
was
opened
,
and
while
none
entered
,
a
well
-
known
voice
said
:
"
Daniel
Deronda
 
<EOS>
may
he
come
in
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
!
<EOS>
come
!
"
<EOS>
said
Mordecai
,
immediately
rising
with
an
irradiated
face
and
opened
eyes
 
apparently
as
little
surprised
as
if
he
had
seen
Deronda
in
the
morning
,
and
expected
this
evening
visit
;
while
Mirah
started
up
blushing
with
confused
,
half
-
alarmed
expectation
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
when
Deronda
entered
,
the
sight
of
him
was
like
the
clearness
after
rain
:
<EOS>
no
clouds
to
come
could
hinder
the
cherishing
beam
of
that
moment
.
<EOS>
As
he
held
out
his
right
hand
to
Mirah
,
who
was
close
to
her
brother
's
left
,
he
laid
his
other
hand
on
Mordecai
's
right
shoulder
,
and
stood
so
a
moment
,
holding
them
both
at
once
,
uttering
no
word
,
but
reading
their
faces
,
till
he
said
anxiously
to
Mirah
,
"
Has
anything
happened
?
 
<EOS>
any
trouble
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Talk
not
of
trouble
now
,
"
said
Mordecai
,
saving
her
from
the
need
to
answer
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
joy
in
your
face
 
<EOS>
let
the
joy
be
ours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mirah
thought
,
"
It
is
for
something
he
can
not
tell
us
.
"
<EOS>
But
they
all
sat
down
,
Deronda
drawing
a
chair
close
in
front
of
Mordecai
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
true
,
"
he
said
,
emphatically
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
joy
which
will
remain
to
us
even
in
the
worst
trouble
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
tell
you
the
reason
of
my
journey
abroad
,
Mordecai
,
because
 
never
mind
 
<EOS>
I
went
to
learn
my
parentage
.
<EOS>
And
you
were
right
.
<EOS>
I
am
a
Jew
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
two
men
clasped
hands
with
a
movement
that
seemed
part
of
the
flash
from
Mordecai
's
eyes
,
and
passed
through
Mirah
like
an
electric
shock
.
<EOS>
But
Deronda
went
on
without
pause
,
speaking
from
Mordecai
's
mind
as
much
as
from
his
own
    
<EOS>
"
We
have
the
same
people
.
<EOS>
Our
souls
have
the
same
vocation
.
<EOS>
We
shall
not
be
separated
by
life
or
by
death
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mordecai
's
answer
was
uttered
in
Hebrew
,
and
in
no
more
than
a
loud
whisper
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
the
liturgical
words
which
express
the
religious
bond
:
"
Our
God
and
the
God
of
our
fathers
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
weight
of
feeling
pressed
too
strongly
on
that
ready
-
winged
speech
which
usually
moved
in
quick
adaptation
to
every
stirring
of
his
fervor
.
  
<EOS>
Mirah
fell
on
her
knees
by
her
brother
's
side
,
and
looked
at
his
now
illuminated
face
,
which
had
just
before
been
so
deathly
.
<EOS>
The
action
was
an
inevitable
outlet
of
the
violent
reversal
from
despondency
to
a
gladness
which
came
over
her
as
solemnly
as
if
she
had
been
beholding
a
religious
rite
.
<EOS>
For
the
moment
she
thought
of
the
effect
on
her
own
life
only
through
the
effect
on
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
it
is
not
only
that
I
am
a
Jew
,
"
Deronda
went
on
,
enjoying
one
of
those
rare
moments
when
our
yearnings
and
our
acts
can
be
completely
one
,
and
the
real
we
behold
is
our
ideal
good
;
"
but
I
come
of
a
strain
that
has
ardently
maintained
the
fellowship
of
our
race
 
a
line
of
Spanish
Jews
that
has
borne
many
students
and
men
of
practical
power
.
<EOS>
And
I
possess
what
will
give
us
a
sort
of
communion
with
them
.
<EOS>
My
grandfather
,
Daniel
Charisi
,
preserved
manuscripts
,
family
records
stretching
far
back
,
in
the
hope
that
they
would
pass
into
the
hands
of
his
grandson
.
<EOS>
And
now
his
hope
is
fulfilled
,
in
spite
of
attempts
to
thwart
it
by
hiding
my
parentage
from
me
.
<EOS>
I
possess
the
chest
containing
them
,
with
his
own
papers
,
and
it
is
down
below
in
this
house
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
leave
it
with
you
,
Mordecai
,
that
you
may
help
me
to
study
the
manuscripts
.
<EOS>
Some
of
them
<EOS>
I
can
read
easily
enough
 
<EOS>
those
in
Spanish
and
Italian
.
<EOS>
Others
are
in
Hebrew
,
and
,
I
think
,
Arabic
;
but
there
seem
to
be
Latin
translations
.
<EOS>
I
was
only
able
to
look
at
them
cursorily
while
I
stayed
at
Mainz
.
<EOS>
We
will
study
them
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
Deronda
ended
with
that
bright
smile
which
,
beaming
out
from
the
habitual
gravity
of
his
face
,
seemed
a
revelation
(
the
reverse
of
the
continual
smile
that
discredits
all
expression
)
.
<EOS>
But
when
this
happy
glance
passed
from
Mordecai
to
rest
on
Mirah
,
it
acted
like
a
little
too
much
sunshine
,
and
made
her
change
her
attitude
.
<EOS>
She
had
knelt
under
an
impulse
with
which
any
personal
embarrassment
was
incongruous
,
and
especially
any
thoughts
about
how
Mrs.
Grandcourt
might
stand
to
this
new
aspect
of
things
 
thoughts
which
made
her
color
under
Deronda
's
glance
,
and
rise
to
take
her
seat
again
in
her
usual
posture
of
crossed
hands
and
feet
,
with
the
effort
to
look
as
quiet
as
possible
.
<EOS>
Deronda
,
equally
sensitive
,
imagined
that
the
feeling
of
which
he
was
conscious
,
had
entered
too
much
into
his
eyes
,
and
had
been
repugnant
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
was
ready
enough
to
believe
that
any
unexpected
manifestation
might
spoil
her
feeling
toward
him
 
and
then
his
precious
relation
to
brother
and
sister
would
be
marred
.
<EOS>
If
Mirah
could
have
no
love
for
him
,
any
advances
of
love
on
his
part
would
make
her
wretched
in
that
continual
contact
with
him
which
would
remain
inevitable
.
  
<EOS>
While
such
feelings
were
pulsating
quickly
in
Deronda
and
Mirah
,
Mordecai
,
seeing
nothing
in
his
friend
's
presence
and
words
but
a
blessed
fulfillment
,
was
already
speaking
with
his
old
sense
of
enlargement
in
utterance
    
"
Daniel
,
from
the
first
<EOS>
,
I
have
said
to
you
,
we
know
not
all
the
pathways
.
<EOS>
Has
there
not
been
a
meeting
among
them
,
as
of
the
operations
in
one
soul
,
where
an
idea
being
born
and
breathing
draws
the
elements
toward
it
,
and
is
fed
and
glows
?
<EOS>
For
all
things
are
bound
together
in
that
Omnipresence
which
is
the
place
and
habitation
of
the
world
,
and
events
are
of
a
glass
<EOS>
wherethrough
<EOS>
our
eyes
see
some
of
the
pathways
.
<EOS>
And
if
it
seems
that
the
erring
and
unloving
wills
of
men
have
helped
to
prepare
you
,
as
Moses
was
prepared
,
to
serve
your
people
the
better
,
that
depends
on
another
order
than
the
law
which
must
guide
our
footsteps
.
<EOS>
For
the
evil
will
of
man
makes
not
a
people
's
good
except
by
stirring
the
righteous
will
of
man
;
and
beneath
all
the
clouds
with
which
our
thought
encompasses
the
Eternal
,
this
is
clear
 
that
a
people
can
be
blessed
only
by
having
counsellors
and
a
multitude
whose
will
moves
in
obedience
to
the
laws
of
justice
and
love
.
<EOS>
For
see
,
now
,
it
was
your
loving
will
that
made
a
chief
pathway
,
and
resisted
the
effect
of
evil
;
for
,
by
performing
the
duties
of
brotherhood
to
my
sister
,
and
seeking
out
her
brother
in
the
flesh
,
your
soul
has
been
prepared
to
receive
with
gladness
this
message
of
the
Eternal
,
"
behold
the
multitude
of
your
brethren
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
It
is
quite
true
that
you
and
Mirah
have
been
my
teachers
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
If
this
revelation
had
been
made
to
me
before
I
knew
you
both
,
I
think
my
mind
would
have
rebelled
against
it
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
should
have
felt
then
 
"
If
I
could
have
chosen
,
I
would
not
have
been
a
Jew
.
<EOS>
"
What
I
feel
now
is
 
that
my
whole
being
is
a
consent
to
the
fact
.
<EOS>
But
it
has
been
the
gradual
accord
between
your
mind
and
mine
which
has
brought
about
that
full
consent
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
the
moment
Deronda
was
speaking
,
that
first
evening
in
the
book
-
shop
was
vividly
in
his
remembrance
,
with
all
the
struggling
aloofness
he
had
then
felt
from
Mordecai
's
prophetic
confidence
.
<EOS>
It
was
his
nature
to
delight
in
satisfying
to
the
utmost
the
eagerly
-
expectant
soul
,
which
seemed
to
be
looking
out
from
the
face
before
him
,
like
the
long
-
enduring
watcher
who
at
last
sees
the
mountain
signal
-
flame
;
and
he
went
on
with
fuller
fervor
    
<EOS>
"
It
is
through
your
inspiration
that
I
have
discerned
what
may
be
my
life
's
task
.
<EOS>
It
is
you
who
have
given
shape
to
what
,
I
believe
,
was
an
inherited
yearning
 
<EOS>
the
effect
of
brooding
,
passionate
thoughts
in
many
ancestors
 
thoughts
that
seem
to
have
been
intensely
present
in
my
grandfather
.
<EOS>
Suppose
the
stolen
offspring
of
some
mountain
tribe
brought
up
in
a
city
of
the
plain
,
or
one
with
an
inherited
genius
for
painting
,
and
born
blind
 
<EOS>
the
ancestral
life
would
lie
within
them
as
a
dim
longing
for
unknown
objects
and
sensations
,
and
the
spell
-
bound
habit
of
their
inherited
frames
would
be
like
a
cunningly
-
wrought
musical
instrument
,
never
played
on
,
but
quivering
throughout
in
uneasy
mysterious
meanings
of
its
intricate
structure
that
,
under
the
right
touch
,
gives
music
.
<EOS>
Something
like
that
,
I
think
,
has
been
my
experience
.
<EOS>
Since
I
began
to
read
and
know
,
I
have
always
longed
for
some
ideal
task
,
in
which
I
might
feel
myself
the
heart
and
brain
of
a
multitude
 
some
social
captainship
,
which
would
come
to
me
as
a
duty
,
and
not
be
striven
for
as
a
personal
prize
.
<EOS>
You
have
raised
the
image
of
such
a
task
for
me
 
to
bind
our
race
together
in
spite
of
heresy
.
<EOS>
You
have
said
to
me
 
<EOS>
"
Our
religion
united
us
before
it
divided
us
 
<EOS>
it
made
us
a
people
before
it
made
Rabbanites
and
Karaites
.
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
try
what
can
be
done
with
that
union
 
<EOS>
I
mean
to
work
in
your
spirit
.
<EOS>
Failure
will
not
be
ignoble
,
but
it
would
be
ignoble
for
me
not
to
try
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Even
as
my
brother
that
fed
at
the
breasts
of
my
mother
,
"
said
Mordecai
,
falling
back
in
his
chair
with
a
look
of
exultant
repose
,
as
after
some
finished
labor
.
  
<EOS>
To
estimate
the
effect
of
this
ardent
outpouring
from
Deronda
we
must
remember
his
former
reserve
,
his
careful
avoidance
of
premature
assent
or
delusive
encouragement
,
which
gave
to
this
decided
pledge
of
himself
a
sacramental
solemnity
,
both
for
his
own
mind
and
Mordecai
's
.
<EOS>
On
Mirah
the
effect
was
equally
strong
,
though
with
a
difference
:
she
felt
a
surprise
which
had
no
place
in
her
brother
's
mind
,
at
Deronda
's
suddenly
revealed
sense
of
nearness
to
them
:
<EOS>
there
seemed
to
be
a
breaking
of
day
around
her
which
might
show
her
other
facts
unlike
her
forebodings
in
the
darkness
.
<EOS>
But
after
a
moment
's
silence
Mordecai
spoke
again
    
<EOS>
"
It
has
begun
already
 
the
marriage
of
our
souls
.
<EOS>
It
waits
but
the
passing
away
of
this
body
,
and
then
they
who
are
betrothed
shall
unite
in
a
stricter
bond
,
and
what
is
mine
shall
be
thine
.
<EOS>
Call
nothing
mine
that
I
have
written
,
Daniel
;
for
though
our
masters
delivered
rightly
that
everything
should
be
quoted
in
the
name
of
him
that
said
it
 
<EOS>
and
their
rule
is
good
 
<EOS>
yet
it
does
not
exclude
the
willing
marriage
which
melts
soul
into
soul
,
and
makes
thought
fuller
as
the
clear
waters
are
made
fuller
,
where
the
fullness
is
inseparable
and
the
clearness
is
inseparable
.
<EOS>
For
I
have
judged
what
I
have
written
,
and
I
desire
the
body
that
I
gave
my
thought
to
pass
away
as
this
fleshly
body
will
pass
;
but
let
the
thought
be
born
again
from
our
fuller
soul
which
shall
be
called
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
ask
me
to
promise
that
,
"
said
Deronda
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
be
convinced
first
of
special
reasons
for
it
in
the
writings
themselves
.
<EOS>
And
I
am
too
backward
a
pupil
yet
.
<EOS>
That
blent
transmission
must
go
on
without
any
choice
of
ours
;
but
what
we
ca
n't
hinder
must
not
make
our
rule
for
what
we
ought
to
choose
.
<EOS>
I
think
our
duty
is
faithful
tradition
where
we
can
attain
it
.
<EOS>
And
so
you
would
insist
for
any
one
but
yourself
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
ask
me
to
deny
my
spiritual
parentage
,
when
I
am
finding
the
clue
of
my
life
in
the
recognition
of
natural
parentage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
ask
for
no
promise
till
you
see
the
reason
,
"
said
Mordecai
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
said
the
truth
:
I
would
obey
the
Master
's
rule
for
another
.
<EOS>
But
for
years
my
hope
,
nay
,
my
confidence
,
has
been
,
not
that
the
imperfect
image
of
my
thought
,
which
is
an
ill
-
shaped
work
of
the
youthful
carver
who
has
seen
a
heavenly
pattern
,
and
trembles
in
imitating
the
vision
 
not
that
this
should
live
,
but
that
my
vision
and
passion
should
enter
into
yours
 
yea
,
into
yours
;
for
he
whom
I
longed
for
afar
,
was
he
not
you
whom
I
discerned
as
mine
when
you
came
near
?
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
you
shall
judge
.
<EOS>
For
my
soul
is
satisfied
.
"
<EOS>
Mordecai
paused
,
and
then
began
in
a
changed
tone
,
reverting
to
previous
suggestions
from
Deronda
's
disclosure
:
"
What
moved
your
parents
   
?
"
<EOS>
but
he
immediately
checked
himself
,
and
added
,
"
Nay
,
I
ask
not
that
you
should
tell
me
aught
concerning
others
,
unless
it
is
your
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Some
time
 
gradually
 
you
will
know
all
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
But
now
tell
me
more
about
yourselves
,
and
how
the
time
has
passed
since
I
went
away
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
there
has
been
some
trouble
.
<EOS>
Mirah
has
been
in
distress
about
something
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
at
Mirah
,
but
she
immediately
turned
to
her
brother
,
appealing
to
him
to
give
the
difficult
answer
.
<EOS>
She
hoped
he
would
not
think
it
necessary
to
tell
Deronda
the
facts
about
her
father
on
such
an
evening
as
this
.
<EOS>
Just
when
Deronda
had
brought
himself
so
near
,
and
identified
himself
with
her
brother
,
it
was
cutting
to
her
that
he
should
hear
of
this
disgrace
clinging
about
them
,
which
seemed
to
have
become
partly
his
.
<EOS>
To
relieve
herself
she
rose
to
take
up
her
hat
and
cloak
,
thinking
she
would
go
to
her
own
room
:
perhaps
they
would
speak
more
easily
when
she
had
left
them
.
<EOS>
But
meanwhile
Mordecai
said
    
"
To
-
day
there
has
been
a
grief
.
<EOS>
A
duty
which
seemed
to
have
gone
far
into
the
distance
,
has
come
back
and
turned
its
face
upon
us
,
and
raised
no
gladness
 
has
raised
a
dread
that
we
must
submit
to
.
<EOS>
But
for
the
moment
we
are
delivered
from
any
visible
yoke
.
<EOS>
Let
us
defer
speaking
of
it
as
if
this
evening
which
is
deepening
about
us
were
the
beginning
of
the
festival
in
which
we
must
offer
the
first
fruits
of
our
joy
,
and
mingle
no
mourning
with
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
divined
the
hinted
grief
,
and
left
it
in
silence
,
rising
as
he
saw
Mirah
rise
,
and
saying
to
her
,
"
Are
you
going
?
<EOS>
I
must
leave
almost
immediately
 
when
I
and
Mrs.
Adam
have
mounted
the
precious
chest
,
and
I
have
delivered
the
key
to
Mordecai
 
<EOS>
no
,
Ezra
,
 
may
I
call
him
Ezra
now
?
<EOS>
I
have
learned
to
think
of
him
as
Ezra
since
I
have
heard
you
call
him
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Please
call
him
Ezra
,
"
said
Mirah
,
faintly
,
feeling
a
new
timidity
under
Deronda
's
glance
and
near
presence
.
<EOS>
Was
there
really
something
different
about
him
,
or
was
the
difference
only
in
her
feeling
?
<EOS>
The
strangely
various
emotions
of
the
last
few
hours
had
exhausted
her
;
she
was
faint
with
fatigue
and
want
of
food
.
<EOS>
Deronda
,
observing
her
pallor
and
tremulousness
,
longed
to
show
more
feeling
,
but
dared
not
.
<EOS>
She
put
out
her
hand
with
an
effort
to
smile
,
and
then
he
opened
the
door
for
her
.
<EOS>
That
was
all
.
  
<EOS>
A
man
of
refined
pride
shrinks
from
making
a
lover
's
approaches
to
a
woman
whose
wealth
or
rank
might
make
them
appear
presumptuous
or
low
-
motived
;
but
Deronda
was
finding
a
more
delicate
difficulty
in
a
position
which
,
superficially
taken
,
was
the
reverse
of
that
 
though
to
an
ardent
reverential
love
,
the
loved
woman
has
always
a
kind
of
wealth
and
rank
which
makes
a
man
keenly
susceptible
about
the
aspect
of
his
addresses
.
<EOS>
Deronda
's
difficulty
was
what
any
generous
man
might
have
felt
in
some
degree
;
but
it
affected
him
peculiarly
through
his
imaginative
sympathy
with
a
mind
in
which
gratitude
was
strong
.
<EOS>
Mirah
,
he
knew
,
felt
herself
bound
to
him
by
deep
obligations
,
which
to
her
sensibilities
might
give
every
wish
of
his
the
aspect
of
a
claim
;
and
an
inability
to
fulfill
it
would
cause
her
a
pain
continually
revived
by
their
inevitable
communion
in
care
of
Ezra
.
<EOS>
Here
were
fears
not
of
pride
only
,
but
of
extreme
tenderness
.
<EOS>
Altogether
,
to
have
the
character
of
a
benefactor
seemed
to
Deronda
's
anxiety
an
insurmountable
obstacle
to
confessing
himself
a
lover
,
unless
in
some
inconceivable
way
it
could
be
revealed
to
him
that
Mirah
's
heart
had
accepted
him
beforehand
.
<EOS>
And
the
agitation
on
his
own
account
,
too
,
was
not
small
.
  
<EOS>
Even
a
man
who
has
practised
himself
in
love
-
making
till
his
own
glibness
has
rendered
him
sceptical
,
may
at
last
be
overtaken
by
the
lover
's
awe
 
may
tremble
,
stammer
,
and
show
other
signs
of
recovered
sensibility
no
more
in
the
range
of
his
acquired
talents
than
pins
and
needles
after
numbness
:
<EOS>
how
much
more
may
that
energetic
timidity
possess
a
man
whose
inward
history
has
cherished
his
susceptibilities
instead
of
dulling
them
,
and
has
kept
all
the
language
of
passion
fresh
and
rooted
as
the
lovely
leafage
about
the
hill
-
side
spring
!
  
<EOS>
As
for
Mirah
her
dear
head
lay
on
its
pillow
that
night
with
its
former
suspicions
thrown
out
of
shape
but
still
present
,
like
an
ugly
story
which
had
been
discredited
but
not
therefore
dissipated
.
<EOS>
All
that
she
was
certain
of
about
Deronda
seemed
to
prove
that
he
had
no
such
fetters
upon
him
as
she
had
been
allowing
herself
to
believe
in
.
<EOS>
His
whole
manner
as
well
as
his
words
implied
that
there
were
no
hidden
bonds
remaining
to
have
any
effect
in
determining
his
future
.
<EOS>
But
notwithstanding
this
plainly
reasonable
inference
,
uneasiness
still
clung
about
Mirah
's
heart
.
<EOS>
Deronda
was
not
to
blame
,
but
he
had
an
importance
for
Mrs.
Grandcourt
which
must
give
her
some
hold
on
him
.
<EOS>
And
the
thought
of
any
close
confidence
between
them
stirred
the
little
biting
snake
that
had
long
lain
curled
and
harmless
in
Mirah
's
gentle
bosom
.
  
<EOS>
But
did
she
this
evening
feel
as
completely
as
before
that
her
jealousy
was
no
less
remote
from
any
possibility
for
herself
personally
than
if
her
human
soul
had
been
lodged
in
the
body
of
a
fawn
that
Deronda
had
saved
from
the
archers
?
<EOS>
Hardly
.
<EOS>
Something
indefinable
had
happened
and
made
a
difference
.
<EOS>
The
soft
warm
rain
of
blossoms
which
had
fallen
just
where
she
was
 
<EOS>
did
it
really
come
because
she
was
there
?
<EOS>
What
spirit
was
there
among
the
boughs
?
            
<EOS>
"
Questa
montagna
e
tale
,
  
<EOS>
Che

<EOS>
It
was
not
many
days
after
her
mother
's
arrival
that
Gwendolen
would
consent
to
remain
at
Genoa
.
<EOS>
Her
desire
to
get
away
from
that
gem
of
the
sea
,
helped
to
rally
her
strength
and
courage
.
<EOS>
For
what
place
,
though
it
were
the
flowery
vale
of
Enna
,
may
not
the
inward
sense
turn
into
a
circle
of
punishment
where
the
flowers
are
no
better
than
a
crop
of
flame
-
tongues
burning
the
soles
of
our
feet
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
like
to
see
the
Mediterranean
again
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
to
her
mother
,
who
thought
that
she
quite
understood
her
child
's
feeling
 
even
in
her
tacit
prohibition
of
any
express
reference
to
her
late
husband
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
,
indeed
,
though
compelled
formally
to
regard
this
time
as
one
of
severe
calamity
,
was
virtually
enjoying
her
life
more
than
she
had
ever
done
since
her
daughter
's
marriage
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
that
her
darling
was
brought
back
to
her
not
merely
with
all
the
old
affection
,
but
with
a
conscious
cherishing
of
her
mother
's
nearness
,
such
as
we
give
to
a
possession
that
we
have
been
on
the
brink
of
losing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
there
,
mamma
?
"
cried
Gwendolen
,
in
the
middle
of
the
night
(
a
bed
had
been
made
for
her
mother
in
the
same
room
with
hers
)
,
very
much
as
she
would
have
done
in
her
early
girlhood
,
if
she
had
felt
frightened
in
lying
awake
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
dear
;
can
I
do
anything
for
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
thank
you
;
only
I
like
so
<EOS>
to
know
you
are
there
.
<EOS>
Do
you
mind
my
waking
you
?
"
<EOS>
(
This
question
would
hardly
have
been
Gwendolen
's
in
her
early
girlhood
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
not
asleep
,
darling
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
seemed
not
real
that
you
were
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
wanted
to
make
it
real
.
<EOS>
I
can
bear
things
if
you
are
with
me
.
<EOS>
But
you
must
not
lie
awake
,
anxious
about
me
.
<EOS>
You
must
be
happy
now
.
<EOS>
You
must
let
me
make
you
happy
now
at
last
 
else
what
shall
I
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
,
dear
;
I
have
the
best
happiness
I
can
have
,
when
you
make
much
of
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
the
next
night
,
hearing
that
she
was
sighing
and
restless
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
said
,
"
Let
me
give
you
your
sleeping
-
draught
,
Gwendolen
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
mamma
,
thank
you
;
I
do
n't
want
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
so
good
for
you
to
sleep
more
,
my
darling
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
say
what
would
be
good
for
me
,
mamma
,
"
Gwendolen
answered
,
impetuously
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
what
would
be
good
for
me
.
<EOS>
You
and
my
uncle
must
not
contradict
me
and
tell
me
anything
is
good
for
me
when
I
feel
it
is
not
good
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
was
silent
,
not
wondering
that
the
poor
child
was
irritable
.
<EOS>
Presently
Gwendolen
said
    
"
I
was
always
naughty
to
you
,
mamma
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
dear
,
no
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
was
,
"
said
Gwendolen
insistently
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
because
I
was
always
wicked
that
I
am
miserable
now
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
burst
into
sobs
and
cries
.
<EOS>
The
determination
to
be
silent
about
all
the
facts
of
her
married
life
and
its
close
,
reacted
in
these
escapes
of
enigmatic
excitement
.
  
<EOS>
But
dim
lights
of
interpretation
were
breaking
on
the
mother
's
mind
through
the
information
that
came
from
Sir
Hugo
to
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
and
,
with
some
omissions
,
from
Mr.
Gascoigne
to
herself
.
<EOS>
The
good
-
natured
baronet
,
while
he
was
attending
to
all
decent
measures
in
relation
to
his
nephew
's
death
,
and
the
possible
washing
ashore
of
the
body
,
thought
it
the
kindest
thing
he
could
do
to
use
his
present
friendly
intercourse
with
the
rector
as
an
opportunity
for
communicating
with
him
,
in
the
mildest
way
,
the
purport
of
Grandcourt
's
will
,
so
as
to
save
him
the
additional
shock
that
would
be
in
store
for
him
if
he
carried
his
illusions
all
the
way
home
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
Sir
Hugo
would
have
been
communicable
enough
without
that
kind
motive
,
but
he
really
felt
the
motive
.
<EOS>
He
broke
the
unpleasant
news
to
the
rector
by
degrees
:
at
first
he
only
implied
his
fear
that
the
widow
was
not
so
splendidly
provided
for
as
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
nay
,
as
the
baronet
himself
had
expected
;
and
only
at
last
,
after
some
previous
vague
reference
to
large
claims
on
Grandcourt
,
he
disclosed
the
prior
relations
which
,
in
the
unfortunate
absence
of
a
legitimate
heir
,
had
determined
all
the
splendor
in
another
direction
.
  
<EOS>
The
rector
was
deeply
hurt
,
and
remembered
,
more
vividly
than
he
had
ever
done
before
,
how
offensively
proud
and
repelling
the
manners
of
the
deceased
had
been
toward
him
 
remembered
also
that
he
himself
,
in
that
interesting
period
just
before
the
arrival
of
the
new
occupant
at
Diplow
,
had
received
hints
of
former
entangling
dissipations
,
and
an
undue
addiction
to
pleasure
,
though
he
had
not
foreseen
that
the
pleasure
which
had
probably
,
so
to
speak
,
been
swept
into
private
rubbish
-
heaps
,
would
ever
present
itself
as
an
array
of
live
caterpillars
,
disastrous
to
the
green
meat
of
respectable
people
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
make
these
retrospective
thoughts
audible
to
Sir
Hugo
,
or
lower
himself
by
expressing
any
indignation
on
merely
personal
grounds
,
but
behaved
like
a
man
of
the
world
who
had
become
a
conscientious
clergyman
.
<EOS>
His
first
remark
was
    
"
<EOS>
When
a
young
man
makes
his
will
in
health
,
he
usually
counts
on
living
a
long
while
.
<EOS>
Probably
Mr.
Grandcourt
did
not
believe
that
this
will
would
ever
have
its
present
effect
.
<EOS>
"
After
a
moment
,
he
added
,
"
The
effect
is
painful
in
more
ways
than
one
.
<EOS>
Female
morality
is
likely
to
suffer
from
this
marked
advantage
and
prominence
being
given
to
illegitimate
offspring
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
in
point
of
fact
,
"
said
Sir
Hugo
,
in
his
comfortable
way
,
"
since
the
boy
is
there
,
this
was
really
the
best
alternative
for
the
disposal
of
the
estates
.
<EOS>
Grandcourt
had
nobody
nearer
than
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
And
it
's
a
chilling
thought
that
you
go
out
of
this
life
only
for
the
benefit
of
a
cousin
.
<EOS>
A
man
gets
a
little
pleasure
in
making
his
will
,
if
it
's
for
the
good
of
his
own
curly
heads
;
but
it
's
a
nuisance
when
you
're
giving
the
bequeathing
to
a
used
-
up
fellow
like
yourself
,
and
one
you
do
n't
care
two
straws
for
.
<EOS>
It
's
the
next
worse
thing
to
having
only
a
life
interest
in
your
estates
.
<EOS>
No
;
I
forgive
Grandcourt
for
that
part
of
his
will
.
<EOS>
But
,
between
ourselves
,
what
I
do
n't
forgive
him
for
,
is
the
shabby
way
he
has
provided
for
your
niece
 
_
<EOS>
our
_
niece
,
I
will
say
 
no
better
a
position
than
if
she
had
been
a
doctor
's
widow
.
<EOS>
Nothing
grates
on
me
more
than
that
posthumous
grudgingness
toward
a
wife
.
<EOS>
A
man
ought
to
have
some
pride
and
fondness
for
his
widow
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
_
<EOS>
should
<EOS>
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
I
take
it
as
a
test
of
a
man
,
that
he
feels
the
easier
about
his
death
when
he
can
think
of
his
wife
and
daughters
being
comfortable
after
it
.
<EOS>
I
like
that
story
of
the
fellows
in
the
Crimean
war
,
who
were
ready
to
go
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
if
their
widows
were
provided
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
has
certainly
taken
me
by
surprise
,
"
said
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
"
all
the
more
because
,
as
the
one
who
stood
in
the
place
of
father
to
my
niece
,
I
had
shown
my
reliance
on
Mr.
Grandcourt
's
apparent
liberality
in
money
matters
by
making
no
claims
for
her
beforehand
.
<EOS>
That
seemed
to
me
due
to
him
under
the
circumstances
.
<EOS>
Probably
you
think
me
blamable
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
blamable
exactly
.
<EOS>
I
respect
a
man
for
trusting
another
.
<EOS>
But
take
my
advice
.
<EOS>
If
you
marry
another
niece
,
though
it
may
be
to
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
,
bind
him
down
.
<EOS>
Your
niece
ca
n't
be
married
for
the
first
time
twice
over
.
<EOS>
And
if
he
's
a
good
fellow
,
he
'll
wish
to
be
bound
.
<EOS>
But
as
to
Mrs.
Grandcourt
,
I
can
only
say
that
I
feel
my
relation
to
her
all
the
nearer
because
I
think
that
she
has
not
been
well
treated
.
<EOS>
And
I
hope
you
will
urge
her
to
rely
on
me
as
a
friend
.
"
  
<EOS>
Thus
spake
the
chivalrous
Sir
Hugo
,
in
his
disgust
at
the
young
and
beautiful
widow
of
a
Mallinger
Grandcourt
being
left
with
only
two
thousand
a
year
and
a
house
in
a
coal
-
mining
district
.
<EOS>
To
the
rector
that
income
naturally
appeared
less
shabby
and
less
accompanied
with
mortifying
privations
;
but
in
this
conversation
he
had
devoured
a
much
keener
sense
than
the
baronet
's
of
the
humiliation
cast
over
his
niece
,
and
also
over
her
nearest
friends
,
by
the
conspicuous
publishing
of
her
husband
's
relation
to
Mrs.
Glasher
.
<EOS>
And
like
all
men
who
are
good
husbands
and
fathers
,
he
felt
the
humiliation
through
the
minds
of
the
women
who
would
be
chiefly
affected
by
it
;
so
that
the
annoyance
of
first
hearing
the
facts
was
far
slighter
than
what
he
felt
in
communicating
them
to
Mrs.
Davilow
,
and
in
anticipating
Gwendolen
's
feeling
whenever
her
mother
saw
fit
to
tell
her
of
them
.
<EOS>
For
the
good
rector
had
an
innocent
conviction
that
his
niece
was
unaware
of
Mrs.
Glasher
's
existence
,
arguing
with
masculine
soundness
from
what
maidens
and
wives
were
likely
to
know
,
do
,
and
suffer
,
and
having
had
a
most
imperfect
observation
of
the
particular
maiden
and
wife
in
question
.
<EOS>
Not
so
Gwendolen
's
mother
,
who
now
thought
that
she
saw
an
explanation
of
much
that
had
been
enigmatic
in
her
child
's
conduct
and
words
before
and
after
her
engagement
,
concluding
that
in
some
inconceivable
way
Gwendolen
had
been
informed
of
this
left
-
handed
marriage
and
the
existence
of
the
children
.
<EOS>
She
trusted
to
opportunities
that
would
arise
in
moments
of
affectionate
confidence
before
and
during
their
journey
to
England
,
when
she
might
gradually
learn
how
far
the
actual
state
of
things
was
clear
to
Gwendolen
,
and
prepare
her
for
anything
that
might
be
a
disappointment
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
spared
from
devices
on
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
do
n't
expect
that
I
am
going
to
be
rich
and
grand
,
mamma
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
not
long
after
the
rector
's
communication
;
"
perhaps
I
shall
have
nothing
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
dressed
,
and
had
been
sitting
long
in
quiet
meditation
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
was
startled
,
but
said
,
after
a
moment
's
reflection
    
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
dear
,
you
will
have
something
.
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
knows
all
about
the
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
will
not
decide
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
abruptly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Surely
,
dear
<EOS>
:
Sir
Hugo
says
you
are
to
have
two
thousand
a
year
and
the
house
at
Gadsmere
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
I
have
will
depend
on
what
I
accept
,
"
said
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
You
and
my
uncle
must
not
attempt
to
cross
me
and
persuade
me
about
this
.
<EOS>
I
will
do
everything
I
can
do
to
make
you
happy
,
but
in
anything
about
my
husband
I
must
not
be
interfered
with
.
<EOS>
Is
eight
hundred
a
year
enough
for
you
,
mamma
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
More
than
enough
,
dear
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
think
of
giving
me
so
much
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
paused
a
little
,
and
then
said
,
"
Do
you
know
who
is
to
have
the
estates
and
the
rest
of
the
money
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
waving
her
hand
in
dismissal
of
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
everything
.
<EOS>
It
is
all
perfectly
right
,
and
I
wish
never
to
have
it
mentioned
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
mother
was
silent
,
looked
away
,
and
rose
to
fetch
a
fan
-
screen
,
with
a
slight
flush
on
her
delicate
cheeks
.
<EOS>
Wondering
,
imagining
<EOS>
,
she
did
not
like
to
meet
her
daughter
's
eyes
,
and
sat
down
again
under
a
sad
constraint
.
<EOS>
What
wretchedness
her
child
had
perhaps
gone
through
,
which
yet
must
remain
as
it
always
had
been
,
locked
away
from
their
mutual
speech
.
<EOS>
But
Gwendolen
was
watching
her
mother
with
that
new
divination
which
experience
had
given
her
;
and
in
tender
relenting
at
her
own
peremptoriness
,
said
,
"
Come
and
sit
nearer
to
me
,
mamma
,
and
do
n't
be
unhappy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davilow
did
as
she
was
told
,
but
bit
her
lips
in
the
vain
attempt
to
hinder
smarting
tears
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
leaned
toward
her
caressingly
and
said
,
"
I
mean
to
be
very
wise
;
I
do
,
really
.
<EOS>
And
good
 
<EOS>
oh
,
so
good
to
you
,
dear
,
<EOS>
old
,
sweet
mamma
,
you
wo
n't
know
me
.
<EOS>
Only
you
must
not
cry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
resolve
that
Gwendolen
had
in
her
mind
was
that
she
would
ask
Deronda
whether
she
ought
to
accept
any
of
her
husband
's
money
 
whether
she
might
accept
what
would
enable
her
to
provide
for
her
mother
.
<EOS>
The
poor
thing
felt
strong
enough
to
do
anything
that
would
give
her
a
higher
place
in
Deronda
's
mind
.
  
<EOS>
An
invitation
that
Sir
Hugo
pressed
on
her
with
kind
urgency
was
that
she
and
Mrs.
Davilow
should
go
straight
with
him
to
Park
Lane
,
and
make
his
house
their
abode
as
long
as
mourning
and
other
details
needed
attending
to
in
London
.
<EOS>
Town
,
he
insisted
,
was
just
then
the
most
retired
of
places
;
and
he
proposed
to
exert
himself
at
once
in
getting
all
articles
belonging
to
Gwendolen
away
from
the
house
in
Grosvenor
Square
.
<EOS>
No
proposal
could
have
suited
her
better
than
this
of
staying
a
little
while
in
Park
Lane
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
easy
for
her
there
to
have
an
interview
with
Deronda
,
if
she
only
knew
how
to
get
a
letter
into
his
hands
,
asking
him
to
come
to
her
.
<EOS>
During
the
journey
,
Sir
Hugo
,
having
understood
that
she
was
acquainted
with
the
purport
of
her
husband
's
will
,
ventured
to
talk
before
her
and
to
her
about
her
future
arrangements
,
referring
here
and
there
to
mildly
agreeable
prospects
as
matters
of
course
,
and
otherwise
shedding
a
decorous
cheerfulness
over
her
widowed
position
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
him
really
the
more
graceful
course
for
a
widow
to
recover
her
spirits
on
finding
that
her
husband
had
not
dealt
as
handsomely
by
her
as
he
might
have
done
;
it
was
the
testator
's
fault
if
he
compromised
all
her
grief
at
his
departure
by
giving
a
testamentary
reason
for
it
,
so
that
she
might
be
supposed
to
look
sad
,
not
because
he
had
left
her
,
but
because
he
had
left
her
poor
.
<EOS>
The
baronet
,
having
his
kindliness
doubly
fanned
by
the
favorable
wind
on
his
fortunes
and
by
compassion
for
Gwendolen
,
had
become
quite
fatherly
in
his
behavior
to
her
,
called
her
"
my
dear
,
"
and
in
mentioning
Gadsmere
to
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
with
its
various
advantages
and
disadvantages
,
spoke
of
what
"
we
"
might
do
to
make
the
best
of
that
property
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
sat
by
in
pale
silence
while
Sir
Hugo
,
with
his
face
turned
toward
Mrs.
Davilow
or
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
conjectured
that
Mrs.
Grandcourt
might
perhaps
prefer
letting
Gadsmere
to
residing
there
during
any
part
of
the
year
,
in
which
case
he
thought
that
it
might
be
leased
on
capital
terms
to
one
of
the
fellows
engaged
with
the
coal
<EOS>
:
Sir
Hugo
had
seen
enough
of
the
place
to
know
that
it
was
as
comfortable
and
picturesque
a
box
as
any
man
need
desire
,
providing
his
desires
were
circumscribed
within
a
coal
area
.
  
<EOS>
"
_
I
_
should
n't
mind
about
the
soot
myself
,
"
said
the
baronet
,
with
that
dispassionateness
which
belongs
to
the
potential
mood
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
is
more
healthy
.
<EOS>
And
if
one
's
business
lay
there
,
Gadsmere
would
be
a
paradise
.
<EOS>
It
makes
quite
a
feature
in
Scrogg
's
history
of
the
county
,
with
the
little
tower
and
the
fine
piece
of
water
 
<EOS>
the
prettiest
print
in
the
book
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
more
important
place
than
Offendene
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
Mr.
Gascoigne
.
  
<EOS>
"
Much
,
"
said
the
baronet
,
decisively
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
there
with
my
poor
brother
 
it
is
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
,
but
I
remember
it
very
well
.
<EOS>
The
rooms
may
not
be
larger
,
but
the
grounds
are
on
a
different
scale
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Our
poor
dear
Offendene
is
empty
after
all
,
"
said
Mrs.
Davilow
.
<EOS>
"
When
it
came
to
the
point
,
Mr.
Haynes
declared
off
,
and
there
has
been
no
one
to
take
it
since
.
<EOS>
I
might
as
well
have
accepted
Lord
Brackenshaw
's
kind
offer
that
I
should
remain
in
it
another
year
rent
-
free
:
for
I
should
have
kept
the
place
aired
and
warmed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
've
something
snug
instead
,
"
said
Sir
Hugo
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
little
too
snug
,
"
said
Mr.
Gascoigne
,
smiling
at
his
sister
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
rather
thick
upon
the
ground
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
had
turned
with
a
changed
glance
when
her
mother
spoke
of
Offendene
being
empty
.
<EOS>
This
conversation
passed
during
one
of
the
long
unaccountable
pauses
often
experienced
in
foreign
trains
at
some
country
station
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
dreamy
,
sunny
stillness
over
the
hedgeless
fields
stretching
to
the
boundary
of
poplars
;
and
to
Gwendolen
the
talk
within
the
carriage
seemed
only
to
make
the
dreamland
larger
with
an
indistinct
region
of
coal
-
pits
,
and
a
purgatorial
Gadsmere
which
she
would
never
visit
;
<EOS>
till
at
her
mother
's
words
,
this
mingled
,
dozing
view
seemed
to
dissolve
and
give
way
to
a
more
wakeful
vision
of
Offendene
and
Pennicote
under
their
cooler
lights
.
<EOS>
She
saw
the
gray
shoulders
of
the
downs
,
the
cattle
-
specked
fields
,
the
shadowy
plantations
with
rutted
lanes
where
the
barked
timber
lay
for
a
wayside
seat
,
the
neatly
-
clipped
hedges
on
the
road
from
the
parsonage
to
Offendene
,
the
avenue
where
she
was
gradually
discerned
from
the
window
,
the
hall
-
door
opening
,
and
her
mother
or
one
of
the
troublesome
sisters
coming
out
to
meet
her
.
<EOS>
All
that
brief
experience
of
a
quiet
home
which
had
once
seemed
a
dullness
to
be
fled
from
,
now
came
back
to
her
as
a
restful
escape
,
a
station
where
she
found
the
breath
of
morning
and
the
unreproaching
voice
of
birds
after
following
a
lure
through
a
long
Satanic
masquerade
,
which
she
had
entered
on
with
an
intoxicated
belief
in
its
disguises
,
and
had
seen
the
end
of
in
shrieking
fear
lest
she
herself
had
become
one
of
the
evil
spirits
who
were
dropping
their
human
mummery
and
hissing
around
her
with
serpent
tongues
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
way
Gwendolen
's
mind
paused
over
Offendene
and
made
it
the
scene
of
many
thoughts
;
but
she
gave
no
further
outward
sign
of
interest
in
this
conversation
,
any
more
than
in
Sir
Hugo
's
opinion
on
the
telegraphic
cable
or
her
uncle
's
views
of
the
Church
Rate
Abolition
Bill
.
<EOS>
What
subjects
will
not
our
talk
embrace
in
leisurely
day
-
journeying
from
Genoa
to
London
?
<EOS>
Even
strangers
,
after
glancing
from
China
to
Peru
and
opening
their
mental
stores
with
a
liberality
threatening
a
mutual
impression
of
poverty
on
any
future
meeting
,
are
liable
to
become
excessively
confidential
.
<EOS>
But
the
baronet
and
the
rector
were
under
a
still
stronger
pressure
toward
cheerful
communication
:
they
were
like
acquaintances
compelled
to
a
long
drive
in
a
mourning
-
coach
who
having
first
remarked
that
the
occasion
is
a
melancholy
one
,
naturally
proceed
to
enliven
it
by
the
most
miscellaneous
discourse
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mind
telling
_
you
_
,
"
said
Sir
Hugo
to
the
rector
,
in
mentioning
some
private
details
;
while
the
rector
,
without
saying
so
,
did
not
mind
telling
the
baronet
about
his
sons
,
and
the
difficulty
of
placing
them
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
By
the
dint
of
discussing
all
persons
and
things
within
driving
-
reach
of
Diplow
,
Sir
Hugo
got
himself
wrought
to
a
pitch
of
interest
in
that
former
home
,
and
of
conviction
that
it
was
his
pleasant
duty
to
regain
and
strengthen
his
personal
influence
in
the
neighborhood
,
that
made
him
declare
his
intention
of
taking
his
family
to
the
place
for
a
month
or
two
before
the
autumn
was
over
;
and
Mr.
Gascoigne
cordially
rejoiced
in
that
prospect
.
<EOS>
Altogether
,
the
journey
was
continued
and
ended
with
mutual
liking
between
the
male
fellow
-
travellers
.
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
Gwendolen
sat
by
like
one
who
had
visited
the
spirit
-
world
and
was
full
to
the
lips
of
an
unutterable
experience
that
threw
a
strange
unreality
over
all
the
talk
she
was
hearing
of
her
own
and
the
world
's
business
;
and
Mrs.
Davilow
was
chiefly
occupied
in
imagining
what
her
daughter
was
feeling
,
and
in
wondering
what
was
signified
by
her
hinted
doubt
whether
she
would
accept
her
husband
's
bequest
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
in
fact
had
before
her
the
unsealed
wall
of
an
immediate
purpose
shutting
off
every
other
resolution
.
<EOS>
How
to
scale
the
wall
?
<EOS>
She
wanted
again
to
see
and
consult
Deronda
,
that
she
might
secure
herself
against
any
act
he
would
disapprove
.
<EOS>
Would
her
remorse
have
maintained
its
power
within
her
,
or
would
she
have
felt
absolved
by
secrecy
,
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
outer
conscience
which
was
made
for
her
by
Deronda
?
<EOS>
It
is
hard
to
say
how
much
we
could
forgive
ourselves
if
we
were
secure
from
judgment
by
another
whose
opinion
is
the
breathing
-
medium
of
all
our
joy
 
who
brings
to
us
with
close
pressure
and
immediate
sequence
<EOS>
that
judgment
of
the
Invisible
and
Universal
which
self
-
flattery
and
the
world
's
tolerance
would
easily
melt
and
disperse
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
our
brother
may
be
in
the
stead
of
God
to
us
,
and
his
opinion
which
has
pierced
even
to
the
joints
and
marrow
,
may
be
our
virtue
in
the
making
.
<EOS>
That
mission
of
Deronda
to
Gwendolen
had
begun
with
what
she
had
felt
to
be
his
judgment
of
her
at
the
gaming
-
table
.
<EOS>
He
might
easily
have
spoiled
it
:
 
much
of
our
lives
is
spent
in
marring
our
own
influence
and
turning
others
'
belief
in
us
into
a
widely
concluding
unbelief
which
they
call
knowledge
of
the
world
,
while
it
is
really
disappointment
in
you
or
me
.
<EOS>
Deronda
had
not
spoiled
his
mission
.
  
<EOS>
But
Gwendolen
had
forgotten
to
ask
him
for
his
address
in
case
she
wanted
to
write
,
and
her
only
way
of
reaching
him
was
through
Sir
Hugo
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
in
the
least
blind
to
the
construction
that
all
witnesses
might
put
on
her
giving
signs
of
dependence
on
Deronda
,
and
her
seeking
him
more
than
he
sought
her
:
Grandcourt
's
rebukes
had
sufficiently
enlightened
her
pride
.
<EOS>
But
the
force
,
the
tenacity
of
her
nature
had
thrown
itself
into
that
dependence
,
and
she
would
no
more
let
go
her
hold
on
Deronda
's
help
,
or
deny
herself
the
interview
her
soul
needed
,
because
of
witnesses
,
than
if
she
had
been
in
prison
in
danger
of
being
condemned
to
death
.
<EOS>
When
she
was
in
Park
Lane
and
knew
that
the
baronet
would
be
going
down
to
the
Abbey
immediately
(
just
to
see
his
family
for
a
couple
of
days
and
then
return
to
transact
needful
business
for
Gwendolen
)
,
she
said
to
him
without
any
air
of
hesitation
,
while
her
mother
was
present
    
<EOS>
"
Sir
Hugo
,
I
wish
to
see
Mr.
Deronda
again
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
his
address
.
<EOS>
Will
you
tell
it
me
,
or
let
him
know
that
I
want
to
see
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
A
quick
thought
passed
across
Sir
Hugo
's
face
,
but
made
no
difference
to
the
ease
with
which
he
said
,
"
Upon
my
word
,
I
do
n't
know
whether
he
's
at
his
chambers
or
the
Abbey
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
make
sure
of
him
.
<EOS>
I
'll
send
a
note
now
to
his
chambers
telling
him
to
come
,
and
if
he
's
at
the
Abbey
I
can
give
him
your
message
and
send
him
up
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
he
will
want
to
obey
your
wish
,
"
the
baronet
ended
,
with
grave
kindness
,
as
if
nothing
could
seem
to
him
more
in
the
appropriate
course
of
things
than
that
she
should
send
such
a
message
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
was
convinced
that
Gwendolen
had
a
passionate
attachment
to
Deronda
<EOS>
,
the
seeds
of
which
had
been
laid
long
ago
,
and
his
former
suspicion
now
recurred
to
him
with
more
strength
than
ever
,
that
her
feeling
was
likely
to
lead
her
into
imprudences
 
in
which
kind
-
hearted
Sir
Hugo
was
determined
to
screen
and
defend
her
as
far
as
lay
in
his
power
.
<EOS>
To
him
it
was
as
pretty
a
story
as
need
be
that
this
fine
creature
and
his
favorite
Dan
should
have
turned
out
to
be
formed
for
each
other
,
and
that
the
unsuitable
husband
should
have
made
his
exit
in
such
excellent
time
.
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
liked
that
a
charming
woman
should
be
made
as
happy
as
possible
.
<EOS>
In
truth
,
what
most
vexed
his
mind
in
this
matter
at
present
was
a
doubt
whether
the
too
lofty
and
inscrutable
Dan
had
not
got
some
scheme
or
other
in
his
head
,
which
would
prove
to
be
dearer
to
him
than
the
lovely
Mrs.
Grandcourt
,
and
put
that
neatly
-
prepared
marriage
with
her
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
It
was
among
the
usual
paradoxes
of
feeling
that
Sir
Hugo
,
who
had
given
his
fatherly
cautions
to
Deronda
against
too
much
tenderness
in
his
relations
with
the
bride
,
should
now
feel
rather
irritated
against
him
by
the
suspicion
that
he
had
not
fallen
in
love
as
he
ought
to
have
done
.
<EOS>
Of
course
all
this
thinking
on
Sir
Hugo
's
part
was
eminently
premature
,
only
a
fortnight
or
so
after
Grandcourt
's
death
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
the
trick
of
thinking
to
be
either
premature
or
behind
-
hand
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
he
sent
the
note
to
Deronda
's
chambers
,
and
it
found
him
there
.
      
<EOS>
"
O
,
welcome
,
pure
-
eyed
Faith
,
white
-
handed
Hope
,
  
Thou
hovering
angel
,
girt
with
golden
wings
!
"
                                           
<EOS>
MILTON
.
   
<EOS>
Deronda
did
not
obey
Gwendolen
's
new
summons
without
some
agitation
.
<EOS>
Not
his
vanity
,
but
his
keen
sympathy
made
him
susceptible
to
the
danger
that
another
's
heart
might
feel
larger
demands
on
him
than
he
would
be
able
to
fulfill
;
and
it
was
no
longer
a
matter
of
argument
with
him
,
but
of
penetrating
consciousness
,
that
Gwendolen
's
soul
clung
to
his
with
a
passionate
need
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
argue
the
existence
of
the
anger
or
the
scorn
that
thrills
through
us
in
a
voice
;
we
simply
feel
it
,
and
it
admits
of
no
disproof
.
<EOS>
Deronda
felt
this
woman
's
destiny
hanging
on
his
over
a
precipice
of
despair
.
<EOS>
Any
one
who
knows
him
can
not
wonder
at
his
inward
confession
,
that
if
all
this
had
happened
little
more
than
a
year
ago
,
he
would
hardly
have
asked
himself
whether
he
loved
her
;
<EOS>
the
impetuous
determining
impulse
which
would
have
moved
him
would
have
been
to
save
her
from
sorrow
,
to
shelter
her
life
forevermore
from
the
dangers
of
loneliness
,
and
carry
out
to
the
last
the
rescue
he
had
begun
in
that
monitory
redemption
of
the
necklace
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
love
and
duty
had
thrown
other
bonds
around
him
,
and
that
impulse
could
no
longer
determine
his
life
;
still
,
it
was
present
in
him
as
a
compassionate
yearning
,
a
painful
quivering
at
the
very
imagination
of
having
again
and
again
to
meet
the
appeal
of
her
eyes
and
words
.
<EOS>
The
very
strength
of
the
bond
,
the
certainty
of
the
resolve
,
that
kept
him
asunder
from
her
,
made
him
gaze
at
her
lot
apart
with
the
more
aching
pity
.
  
<EOS>
He
awaited
her
coming
in
the
back
drawing
-
room
 
part
of
that
white
and
crimson
space
where
they
had
sat
together
at
the
musical
party
,
where
Gwendolen
had
said
for
the
first
time
that
her
lot
depended
on
his
not
forsaking
her
,
and
her
appeal
had
seemed
to
melt
into
the
melodic
cry
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Per
pietà
non
dirmi
addio
_
.
<EOS>
But
the
melody
had
come
from
Mirah
's
dear
voice
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
walked
about
this
room
,
which
he
had
for
years
known
by
heart
,
with
a
strange
sense
of
metamorphosis
in
his
own
life
.
<EOS>
The
familiar
objects
around
him
,
from
Lady
Mallinger
's
gently
smiling
portrait
to
the
also
human
and
urbane
faces
of
the
lions
on
the
pilasters
of
the
chimney
-
piece
,
seemed
almost
to
belong
to
a
previous
state
of
existence
which
he
was
revisiting
in
memory
only
,
not
in
reality
;
so
deep
and
transforming
had
been
the
impressions
he
had
lately
experienced
,
<EOS>
so
new
were
the
conditions
under
which
he
found
himself
in
the
house
he
had
been
accustomed
to
think
of
as
a
home
 
standing
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
awaiting
the
entrance
of
a
young
creature
whose
life
had
also
been
undergoing
a
transformation
 
a
tragic
transformation
toward
a
wavering
result
,
in
which
he
felt
with
apprehensiveness
that
his
own
action
was
still
bound
up
.
  
<EOS>
But
Gwendolen
was
come
in
,
looking
changed
;
not
only
by
her
mourning
dress
,
but
by
a
more
satisfied
quietude
of
expression
than
he
had
seen
in
her
face
at
Genoa
.
<EOS>
Her
satisfaction
was
that
Deronda
was
there
;
but
there
was
no
smile
between
them
as
they
met
and
clasped
hands
;
each
was
full
of
remembrance
 
full
of
anxious
prevision
.
<EOS>
She
said
,
"
It
was
good
of
you
to
come
.
<EOS>
Let
us
sit
down
,
"
immediately
seating
herself
in
the
nearest
chair
.
<EOS>
He
placed
himself
opposite
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
asked
you
to
come
because
I
want
you
to
tell
me
what
I
ought
to
do
,
"
she
began
,
at
once
.
"
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
afraid
of
telling
me
what
you
think
is
right
,
because
it
seems
hard
.
<EOS>
I
have
made
up
my
mind
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
I
was
afraid
once
of
being
poor
;
I
could
not
bear
to
think
of
being
under
other
people
;
and
that
was
why
I
did
something
 
why
I
married
.
<EOS>
I
have
borne
worse
things
now
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
could
bear
to
be
poor
,
if
you
think
I
ought
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
about
my
husband
's
will
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Sir
Hugo
told
me
,
"
said
Deronda
,
already
guessing
the
question
she
had
to
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ought
I
to
take
anything
he
has
left
me
?
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
what
I
have
been
thinking
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
with
a
more
nervous
eagerness
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
may
not
quite
know
that
I
really
did
think
a
good
deal
about
my
mother
when
I
married
.
<EOS>
I
_
was
_
selfish
,
but
I
did
love
her
,
and
feel
about
her
poverty
;
and
what
comforted
me
most
at
first
,
when
I
was
miserable
,
was
her
being
better
off
because
I
had
married
.
<EOS>
The
thing
that
would
be
hardest
to
me
now
would
be
to
see
her
in
poverty
again
;
and
I
have
been
thinking
that
if
I
took
enough
to
provide
for
her
,
and
no
more
 
nothing
for
myself
 
it
would
not
be
wrong
;
for
I
was
very
precious
to
my
mother
 
<EOS>
and
he
took
me
from
her
 
<EOS>
and
he
meant
 
<EOS>
and
if
she
had
known
 
"
  
Gwendolen
broke
off
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
preparing
herself
for
this
interview
by
thinking
of
hardly
anything
else
than
this
question
of
right
toward
her
mother
;
but
the
question
had
carried
with
it
thoughts
and
reasons
which
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
utter
,
and
these
perilous
remembrances
swarmed
between
her
words
,
making
her
speech
more
and
more
agitated
and
tremulous
.
<EOS>
She
looked
down
helplessly
at
her
hands
,
now
unladen
of
all
rings
except
her
wedding
-
ring
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
not
hurt
yourself
by
speaking
of
that
,
"
said
Deronda
,
tenderly
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
need
;
the
case
is
very
simple
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
can
hardly
judge
wrongly
about
it
.
<EOS>
You
consult
me
because
I
am
the
only
person
to
whom
you
have
confided
the
most
painful
part
of
your
experience
:
and
I
can
understand
your
scruples
.
<EOS>
"
He
did
not
go
on
immediately
,
waiting
for
her
to
recover
herself
.
<EOS>
The
silence
seemed
to
Gwendolen
full
of
the
tenderness
that
she
heard
in
his
voice
,
and
she
had
courage
to
lift
up
her
eyes
and
look
at
him
as
he
said
,
"
You
are
conscious
of
something
which
you
feel
to
be
a
crime
toward
one
who
is
dead
.
<EOS>
You
think
that
you
have
forfeited
all
claim
as
a
wife
.
<EOS>
You
shrink
from
taking
what
was
his
.
<EOS>
You
want
to
keep
yourself
from
profiting
by
his
death
.
<EOS>
Your
feeling
even
urges
you
to
some
self
-
punishment
 
some
scourging
of
the
self
that
disobeyed
your
better
<EOS>
will
 
the
will
that
struggled
against
temptation
.
<EOS>
I
have
known
something
of
that
myself
.
<EOS>
Do
I
understand
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
 
at
least
,
I
want
to
be
good
 
not
like
what
I
have
been
,
"
said
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
try
to
bear
what
you
think
I
ought
to
bear
.
<EOS>
I
have
tried
to
tell
you
the
worst
about
myself
.
<EOS>
What
ought
I
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
no
one
but
yourself
were
concerned
in
this
question
of
income
,
"
said
Deronda
,
"
I
should
hardly
dare
to
urge
you
against
any
remorseful
prompting
;
but
I
take
as
a
guide
now
,
your
feeling
about
Mrs.
Davilow
,
which
seems
to
me
quite
just
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
think
that
your
husband
's
dues
even
to
yourself
are
nullified
by
any
act
you
have
committed
.
<EOS>
He
voluntarily
entered
into
your
life
,
and
affected
its
course
in
what
is
always
the
most
momentous
way
.
<EOS>
But
setting
that
aside
,
it
was
due
from
him
in
his
position
that
he
should
provide
for
your
mother
,
and
he
of
course
understood
that
if
this
will
took
effect
she
would
share
the
provision
he
had
made
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
had
eight
hundred
a
year
.
<EOS>
What
I
thought
of
was
to
take
that
and
leave
the
rest
,
"
said
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
so
long
inwardly
arguing
for
this
as
a
permission
,
that
her
mind
could
not
at
once
take
another
attitude
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
is
not
your
duty
to
fix
a
limit
in
that
way
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
You
would
be
making
a
painful
enigma
for
Mrs.
Davilow
;
an
income
from
which
you
shut
yourself
out
must
be
embittered
to
her
.
<EOS>
And
your
own
course
would
become
too
difficult
.
<EOS>
We
agreed
at
Genoa
that
the
burden
on
your
conscience
is
one
what
no
one
ought
to
be
admitted
to
the
knowledge
of
.
<EOS>
The
future
beneficence
of
your
life
will
be
best
furthered
by
your
saving
all
others
from
the
pain
of
that
knowledge
.
<EOS>
In
my
opinion
you
ought
simply
to
abide
by
the
provisions
of
your
husband
's
will
,
and
let
your
remorse
tell
only
on
the
use
that
you
will
make
of
your
monetary
independence
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
uttering
the
last
sentence
Deronda
automatically
took
up
his
hat
which
he
had
laid
on
the
floor
beside
him
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
sensitive
to
his
slightest
movement
,
felt
her
heart
giving
a
great
leap
,
as
if
it
too
had
a
consciousness
of
its
own
,
and
would
hinder
him
from
going
:
in
the
same
moment
she
rose
from
her
chair
,
unable
to
reflect
that
the
movement
was
an
acceptance
of
his
apparent
intention
to
leave
her
;
and
Deronda
,
of
course
,
also
rose
,
advancing
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
what
you
tell
me
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
hurriedly
;
"
but
what
else
shall
I
do
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
other
than
these
simple
words
were
possible
to
her
;
and
even
these
were
too
much
for
her
in
a
state
of
emotion
where
her
proud
secrecy
was
disenthroned
:
as
the
child
-
like
sentences
fell
from
her
lips
they
re
-
acted
on
her
like
a
picture
of
her
own
helplessness
,
and
she
could
not
check
the
sob
which
sent
the
large
tears
to
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
Deronda
,
too
,
felt
a
crushing
pain
;
but
imminent
consequences
were
visible
to
him
,
and
urged
him
to
the
utmost
exertion
of
conscience
.
<EOS>
When
she
had
pressed
her
tears
away
,
he
said
,
in
a
gently
questioning
tone
    
<EOS>
"
You
will
probably
be
soon
going
with
Mrs.
Davilow
into
the
country
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
in
a
week
or
ten
days
.
<EOS>
"
Gwendolen
waited
an
instant
,
turning
her
eyes
vaguely
toward
the
window
,
as
if
looking
at
some
imagined
prospect
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
be
kind
to
them
all
 
they
can
be
happier
than
I
can
.
<EOS>
Is
that
the
best
I
can
do
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
duty
that
can
not
be
doubtful
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
He
paused
a
little
between
his
sentences
,
feeling
a
weight
of
anxiety
on
all
his
words
.
"
<EOS>
Other
duties
will
spring
from
it
.
<EOS>
Looking
at
your
life
as
a
debt
may
seem
the
dreariest
view
of
things
at
a
distance
;
but
it
can
not
really
be
so
.
<EOS>
What
makes
life
dreary
is
the
want
of
motive
:
but
once
beginning
to
act
with
that
penitential
,
loving
purpose
you
have
in
your
mind
,
there
will
be
unexpected
satisfactions
 
there
will
be
newly
-
opening
needs
 
continually
coming
to
carry
you
on
from
day
to
day
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
your
life
growing
like
a
plant
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
turned
her
eyes
on
him
with
the
look
of
one
athirst
toward
the
sound
of
unseen
waters
.
<EOS>
Deronda
felt
the
look
as
if
she
had
been
stretching
her
arms
toward
him
from
a
forsaken
shore
.
<EOS>
His
voice
took
an
affectionate
imploringness
when
he
said
    
"
This
sorrow
,
which
has
cut
down
to
the
root
,
has
come
to
you
while
you
are
so
young
 
<EOS>
try
to
think
of
it
not
as
a
spoiling
of
your
life
,
but
as
a
preparation
for
it
.
<EOS>
Let
it
be
a
preparation
   
<EOS>
"
Any
one
overhearing
his
tones
would
have
thought
he
was
entreating
for
his
own
happiness
.
<EOS>
"
See
!
<EOS>
you
have
been
saved
from
the
worst
evils
that
might
have
come
from
your
marriage
,
which
you
feel
was
wrong
.
<EOS>
You
have
had
a
vision
of
injurious
,
selfish
action
 
a
vision
of
possible
degradation
;
think
that
a
severe
angel
,
seeing
you
along
the
road
of
error
,
grasped
you
by
the
wrist
and
showed
you
the
horror
of
the
life
you
must
avoid
.
<EOS>
And
it
has
come
to
you
in
your
spring
-
time
.
<EOS>
Think
of
it
as
a
preparation
.
<EOS>
You
can
,
you
will
,
be
among
the
best
of
women
,
such
as
make
others
glad
that
they
were
born
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
words
were
like
the
touch
of
a
miraculous
hand
to
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
Mingled
emotions
streamed
through
her
frame
with
a
strength
that
seemed
the
beginning
of
a
new
existence
,
having
some
new
power
or
other
which
stirred
in
her
vaguely
.
<EOS>
So
pregnant
is
the
divine
hope
of
moral
recovery
with
the
energy
that
fulfills
it
.
<EOS>
So
potent
in
us
is
the
infused
action
of
another
soul
,
before
which
we
bow
in
complete
love
.
<EOS>
But
the
new
existence
seemed
inseparable
from
Deronda
:
the
hope
seemed
to
make
his
presence
permanent
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
her
thought
,
that
he
loved
her
,
and
would
cling
to
her
 
a
thought
would
have
tottered
with
improbability
;
it
was
her
spiritual
breath
.
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
since
that
terrible
moment
on
the
sea
a
flush
rose
and
spread
over
her
cheek
,
brow
and
neck
,
deepened
an
instant
or
two
,
and
then
gradually
disappeared
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
speak
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
advanced
and
put
out
his
hand
,
saying
,
"
I
must
not
weary
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
startled
by
the
sense
that
he
was
going
,
and
put
her
hand
in
his
,
still
without
speaking
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
look
ill
yet
 
unlike
yourself
,
"
he
added
,
while
he
held
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
sleep
much
,
"
she
answered
,
with
some
return
of
her
dispirited
manner
.
<EOS>
"
Things
repeat
themselves
in
me
so
.
<EOS>
They
come
back
 
<EOS>
they
will
all
come
back
<EOS>
,
"
she
ended
,
shudderingly
,
a
chill
fear
threatening
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
By
degrees
they
will
be
less
insistent
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
drop
her
hand
or
move
away
from
her
abruptly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
Hugo
says
he
shall
come
to
stay
at
Diplow
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
snatching
at
previously
intended
words
which
had
slipped
away
from
her
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
come
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Probably
,
"
said
Deronda
,
and
then
feeling
that
the
word
was
cold
,
he
added
,
correctively
,
"
Yes
,
I
shall
come
,
"
and
then
released
her
hand
,
with
the
final
friendly
pressure
of
one
who
has
virtually
said
good
-
bye
<EOS>
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
not
again
here
,
before
I
leave
town
?
"
said
Gwendolen
,
with
timid
sadness
,
looking
as
pallid
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
What
could
Deronda
say
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
I
can
be
of
any
use
 
if
you
wish
me
 
certainly
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
wish
it
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
impetuously
;
"
you
know
I
must
wish
it
.
<EOS>
What
strength
have
I
?
<EOS>
Who
else
is
there
?
"
<EOS>
Again
a
sob
was
rising
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
felt
a
pang
,
which
showed
itself
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
He
looked
miserable
as
he
said
,
"
I
will
certainly
come
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
perceived
the
change
in
his
face
;
but
the
intense
relief
of
expecting
him
to
come
again
could
not
give
way
to
any
other
feeling
,
and
there
was
a
recovery
of
the
inspired
hope
and
courage
in
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
unhappy
about
me
,
"
she
said
,
in
a
tone
of
affectionate
assurance
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
remember
your
words
 
every
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
I
shall
remember
what
you
believe
about
me
;
I
shall
try
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
at
him
firmly
,
and
put
out
her
hand
again
as
if
she
had
forgotten
what
had
passed
since
those
words
of
his
which
she
promised
to
remember
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
approach
to
a
smile
on
her
lips
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
smiled
since
her
husband
's
death
.
<EOS>
When
she
stood
still
and
in
silence
,
she
looked
like
a
melancholy
statue
of
the
Gwendolen
whose
laughter
had
once
been
so
ready
when
others
were
grave
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
only
by
remembering
the
searching
anguish
which
had
changed
the
aspect
of
the
world
for
her
that
we
can
understand
her
behavior
to
Deronda
 
the
unreflecting
openness
,
nay
,
the
importunate
pleading
,
with
which
she
expressed
her
dependence
on
him
.
<EOS>
Considerations
such
as
would
have
filled
the
minds
of
indifferent
spectators
could
not
occur
to
her
,
any
more
than
if
flames
had
been
mounting
around
her
,
and
she
had
flung
herself
into
his
open
arms
and
clung
about
his
neck
that
he
might
carry
her
into
safety
.
<EOS>
She
identified
him
with
the
struggling
regenerative
process
in
her
which
had
begun
with
his
action
.
<EOS>
Is
it
any
wonder
that
she
saw
her
own
necessity
reflected
in
his
feeling
?
<EOS>
She
was
in
that
state
of
unconscious
reliance
and
expectation
which
is
a
common
experience
with
us
when
we
are
preoccupied
with
our
own
trouble
or
our
own
purposes
.
<EOS>
We
diffuse
our
feeling
over
others
,
and
count
on
their
acting
from
our
motives
.
<EOS>
Her
imagination
had
not
been
turned
to
a
future
union
with
Deronda
by
any
other
than
the
spiritual
tie
which
had
been
continually
strengthening
;
but
also
it
had
not
been
turned
toward
a
future
separation
from
him
.
<EOS>
Love
-
making
and
marriage
 
<EOS>
how
could
they
now
be
the
imagery
in
which
poor
Gwendolen
's
deepest
attachment
could
spontaneously
clothe
itself
?
<EOS>
Mighty
Love
had
laid
his
hand
upon
her
;
but
what
had
he
demanded
of
her
?
<EOS>
Acceptance
of
rebuke
 
<EOS>
the
hard
task
of
self
-
change
 
confession
 
endurance
.
<EOS>
If
she
cried
toward
him
,
what
then
?
<EOS>
She
cried
as
the
child
cries
whose
little
feet
have
fallen
backward
 
cried
to
be
taken
by
the
hand
,
lest
she
should
lose
herself
.
  
<EOS>
The
cry
pierced
Deronda
.
<EOS>
What
position
could
have
been
more
difficult
for
a
man
full
of
tenderness
,
yet
with
clear
foresight
?
<EOS>
He
was
the
only
creature
who
knew
the
real
nature
of
Gwendolen
's
trouble
:
to
withdraw
himself
from
any
appeal
of
hers
would
be
to
consign
her
to
a
dangerous
loneliness
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
reconcile
himself
to
the
cruelty
of
apparently
rejecting
her
dependence
on
him
;
and
yet
in
the
nearer
or
farther
distance
he
saw
a
coming
wrench
,
which
all
present
strengthening
of
their
bond
would
make
the
harder
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
obliged
to
risk
that
.
<EOS>
He
went
once
and
again
to
Park
Lane
before
Gwendolen
left
;
but
their
interviews
were
in
the
presence
of
Mrs.
Davilow
,
and
were
therefore
less
agitating
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
since
she
had
determined
to
accept
her
income
,
had
conceived
a
project
which
she
liked
to
speak
of
:
it
was
,
to
place
her
mother
and
sisters
with
herself
in
Offendene
again
,
and
,
as
she
said
,
piece
back
her
life
unto
that
time
when
they
first
went
there
,
and
when
everything
was
happiness
about
her
,
only
she
did
not
know
it
.
<EOS>
The
idea
had
been
mentioned
to
Sir
Hugo
,
who
was
going
to
exert
himself
about
the
letting
of
Gadsmere
for
a
rent
which
would
more
than
pay
the
rent
of
Offendene
.
<EOS>
All
this
was
told
to
Deronda
,
who
willingly
dwelt
on
a
subject
that
seemed
to
give
some
soothing
occupation
to
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
He
said
nothing
and
she
asked
nothing
,
of
what
chiefly
occupied
himself
.
<EOS>
Her
mind
was
fixed
on
his
coming
to
Diplow
before
the
autumn
was
over
;
and
she
no
more
thought
of
the
Lapidoths
 
the
little
Jewess
and
her
brother
 
as
likely
to
make
a
difference
in
her
destiny
,
than
of
the
fermenting
political
and
social
leaven
which
was
making
a
difference
in
the
history
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
In
fact
poor
Gwendolen
's
memory
had
been
stunned
,
and
all
outside
the
lava
-
lit
track
of
her
troubled
conscience
,
and
her
effort

BROWNING

<EOS>

King
and

Book
_
.
   
<EOS>
Meanwhile
Ezra
and
Mirah
,
whom
Gwendolen
did
not
include
in
her
thinking
about
Deronda
,
were
having
their
relation
to
him
drawn
closer
and
brought
into
fuller
light
.
  
<EOS>
The
father
Lapidoth
had
quitted
his
daughter
at
the
doorstep
,
ruled
by
that
possibility
of
staking
something
in
play
or
betting
which
presented
itself
with
the
handling
of
any
sum
beyond
the
price
of
staying
actual
hunger
,
and
left
no
care
for
alternative
prospects
or
resolutions
.
<EOS>
Until
he
had
lost
everything
he
never
considered
whether
he
would
apply
to
Mirah
again
or
whether
he
would
brave
his
son
's
presence
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
moment
he
had
shrunk
from
encountering
Ezra
as
he
would
have
shrunk
from
any
other
situation
of
disagreeable
constraint
;
and
the
possession
of
Mirah
's
purse
was
enough
to
banish
the
thought
of
future
necessities
.
<EOS>
The
gambling
appetite
is
more
absolutely
dominant
than
bodily
hunger
,
which
can
be
neutralized
by
an
emotional
or
intellectual
excitation
;
but
the
passion
for
watching
chances
 
the
habitual
suspensive
poise
of
the
mind
in
actual
or
imaginary
play
 
nullifies
the
susceptibility
of
other
excitation
.
<EOS>
In
its
final
,
imperious
stage
,
it
seems
the
unjoyous
dissipation
of
demons
,
seeking
diversion
on
the
burning
marl
of
perdition
.
  
<EOS>
But
every
form
of
selfishness
,
however
abstract
and
unhuman
,
requires
the
support
of
at
least
one
meal
a
day
;
and
though
Lapidoth
's
appetite
for
food
and
drink
was
extremely
moderate
,
he
had
slipped
into
a
shabby
,
unfriendly
form
of
life
in
which
the
appetite
could
not
be
satisfied
without
some
ready
money
.
<EOS>
When
,
in
a
brief
visit
at
a
house
which
announced
"
Pyramids
"
on
the
window
-
blind
,
he
had
first
doubled
and
trebled
and
finally
lost
Mirah
's
thirty
shillings
,
he
went
out
with
her
empty
purse
in
his
pocket
,
already
balancing
in
his
mind
whether
he
should
get
another
immediate
stake
by
pawning
the
purse
,
or
whether
he
should
go
back
to
her
giving
himself
a
good
countenance
by
restoring
the
purse
,
and
declaring
that
he
had
used
the
money
in
paying
a
score
that
was
standing
against
him
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
among
the
sensibilities
still
left
strong
in
Lapidoth
was
the
sensibility
to
his
own
claims
,
and
he
appeared
to
himself
to
have
a
claim
on
any
property
his
children
might
possess
,
which
was
stronger
than
the
justice
of
his
son
's
resentment
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
to
take
up
his
lodging
with
his
children
was
the
best
thing
he
could
do
;
and
the
more
he
thought
of
meeting
Ezra
the
less
he
winced
from
it
,
his
imagination
being
more
wrought
on
by
the
chances
of
his
getting
something
into
his
pocket
with
safety
and
without
exertion
,
than
by
the
threat
of
a
private
humiliation
.
<EOS>
Luck
had
been
against
him
lately
;
he
expected
it
to
turn
 
and
might
not
the
turn
begin
with
some
opening
of
supplies
which
would
present
itself
through
his
daughter
's
affairs
and
the
good
friends
she
had
spoken
of
?
<EOS>
Lapidoth
counted
on
the
fascination
of
his
cleverness
 
an
old
habit
of
mind
which
early
experience
had
sanctioned
:
and
it
is
not
only
women
who
are
unaware
of
their
diminished
charm
,
or
imagine
that
they
can
feign
not
to
be
worn
out
.
  
<EOS>
The
result
of
Lapidoth
's
rapid
balancing
was
that
he
went
toward
the
little
square
in
Brompton
with
the
hope
that
,
by
walking
about
and
watching
,
he
might
catch
sight
of
Mirah
going
out
or
returning
,
in
which
case
his
entrance
into
the
house
would
be
made
easier
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
already
evening
 
<EOS>
the
evening
of
the
day
next
to
that
which
he
had
first
seen
her
;
and
after
a
little
waiting
,
weariness
made
him
reflect
that
he
might
ring
,
and
if
she
were
not
at
home
he
might
ask
the
time
at
which
she
was
expected
.
<EOS>
But
on
coming
near
the
house
he
knew
that
she
was
at
home
:
he
heard
her
singing
.
  
<EOS>
Mirah
,
seated
at
the
piano
,
was
pouring
forth
"
_
Herz
,
mein
Herz
_
,
"
while
Ezra
was
listening
with
his
eyes
shut
,
when
Mrs.
Adam
opened
the
door
,
and
said
in
some
embarrassment
    
"
A
gentleman
below
says
he
is
your
father
,
miss
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
down
to
him
,
"
said
Mirah
,
starting
up
immediately
and
looking
at
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Mirah
,
not
so
,
"
said
Ezra
,
with
decision
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Let
him
come
up
,
Mrs.
Adam
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mirah
stood
with
her
hands
pinching
each
other
,
and
feeling
sick
with
anxiety
,
while
she
continued
looking
at
Ezra
,
who
had
also
risen
,
and
was
evidently
much
shaken
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
an
expression
in
his
face
which
she
had
never
seen
before
;
his
brow
was
knit
,
his
lips
seemed
hardened
with
the
same
severity
that
gleamed
from
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
When
Mrs.
Adam
opened
the
door
to
let
in
the
father
,
she
could
not
help
casting
a
look
at
the
group
,
and
after
glancing
from
the
younger
man
to
the
elder
,
said
to
herself
as
she
closed
the
door
,
"
Father
,
sure
enough
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
likeness
was
that
of
outline
,
which
is
always
most
striking
at
the
first
moment
;
the
expression
had
been
wrought
into
the
strongest
contrasts
by
such
hidden
or
inconspicuous
differences
as
can
make
the
genius
of
a
Cromwell
within
the
outward
type
of
a
father
who
was
no
more
than
a
respectable
parishioner
.
  
<EOS>
Lapidoth
had
put
on
a
melancholy
expression
beforehand
,
but
there
was
some
real
wincing
in
his
frame
as
he
said
    
"
Well
,
Ezra
,
my
boy
,
you
hardly
know
me
after
so
many
years
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
 
<EOS>
too
well
 
<EOS>
father
,
"
said
Ezra
,
with
a
slow
biting
solemnity
which
made
the
word
father
a
reproach
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
you
are
not
pleased
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
wonder
at
it
.
<EOS>
Appearances
have
been
against
me
.
<EOS>
When
a
man
gets
into
straits
he
ca
n't
do
just
as
he
would
by
himself
or
anybody
else
,
_
I_'ve
suffered
enough
,
I
know
,
"
said
Lapidoth
,
quickly
.
<EOS>
In
speaking
he
always
recovered
some
glibness
and
hardihood
;
and
now
turning
toward
Mirah
,
he
held
out
her
purse
,
saying
,
"
Here
's
your
little
purse
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
I
thought
you
'd
be
anxious
about
it
because
of
that
bit
of
writing
.
<EOS>
I
've
emptied
it
<EOS>
,
you
'll
see
,
for
I
had
a
score
to
pay
for
food
and
lodging
.
<EOS>
I
knew
you
would
like
me
to
clear
myself
,
and
here
I
stand
 
without
a
single
farthing
in
my
pocket
 
at
the
mercy
of
my
children
.
<EOS>
You
can
turn
me
out
if
you
like
,
without
getting
a
policeman
.
<EOS>
Say
the
word
,
Mirah
;
say
,
"
Father
,
I
've
had
enough
of
you
;
you
made
a
pet
of
me
,
and
spent
your
all
on
me
,
when
I
could
n't
have
done
without
you
;
but
I
can
do
better
without
you
now
,
"
 
say
that
,
and
I
'm
gone
out
like
a
spark
.
<EOS>
I
sha
n't
spoil
your
pleasure
again
.
<EOS>
"
The
tears
were
in
his
voice
as
usual
,
before
he
had
finished
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
I
could
never
say
it
,
father
,
"
answered
Mirah
,
with
not
the
less
anguish
because
she
felt
the
falsity
of
everything
in
his
speech
except
the
implied
wish
to
remain
in
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mirah
,
my
sister
,
leave
us
!
"
<EOS>
said
Ezra
,
in
a
tone
of
authority
.
  
<EOS>
She
looked
at
her
brother
falteringly
,
beseechingly
 
in
awe
of
his
decision
,
yet
unable
to
go
without
making
a
plea
for
this
father
who
was
like
something
that
had
grown
in
her
flesh
with
pain
.
<EOS>
She
went
close
to
her
brother
,
and
putting
her
hand
in
his
,
said
,
in
a
low
voice
,
but
not
so
low
as
to
be
unheard
by
Lapidoth
,
"
Remember
,
Ezra
 
<EOS>
you
said
my
mother
would
not
have
shut
him
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Trust
me
,
and
go
,
"
said
Ezra
.
  
<EOS>
She
left
the
room
,
but
after
going
a
few
steps
up
the
stairs
,
sat
down
with
a
palpitating
heart
.
<EOS>
If
,
because
of
anything
her
brother
said
to
him
,
he
went
away
      
<EOS>
Lapidoth
had
some
sense
of
what
was
being
prepared
for
him
in
his
son
's
mind
,
but
he
was
beginning
to
adjust
himself
to
the
situation
and
find
a
point
of
view
that
would
give
him
a
cool
superiority
to
any
attempt
at
humiliating
him
.
<EOS>
This
haggard
son
,
speaking
as
from
a
sepulchre
,
had
the
incongruity
which
selfish
levity
learns
to
see
in
suffering
,
and
until
the
unrelenting
pincers
of
disease
clutch
its
own
flesh
.
<EOS>
Whatever
preaching
he
might
deliver
must
be
taken
for
a
matter
of
course
,
as
a
man
finding
shelter
from
hail
in
an
open
cathedral
might
take
a
little
religious
howling
that
happened
to
be
going
on
there
.
  
<EOS>
Lapidoth
was
not
born
with
this
sort
of
callousness
:
he
had
achieved
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
home
that
we
have
here
,
"
Ezra
began
,
"
is
maintained
partly
by
the
generosity
of
a
beloved
friend
who
supports
me
,
and
partly
by
the
labors
of
my
sister
,
who
supports
herself
.
<EOS>
While
we
have
a
home
we
will
not
shut
you
out
from
it
.
<EOS>
We
will
not
cast
you
out
to
the
mercy
of
your
vices
.
<EOS>
For
you
are
our
father
,
and
though
you
have
broken
your
bond
,
we
acknowledge
ours
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
never
trust
you
.
<EOS>
You
absconded
with
money
,
leaving
your
debts
unpaid
;
you
forsook
my
mother
;
you
robbed
her
of
her
little
child
and
broke
her
heart
;
you
have
become
a
gambler
,
and
where
shame
and
conscience
were
there
sits
an
insatiable
desire
;
you
were
ready
to
sell
my
sister
 
<EOS>
you
had
sold
her
,
but
the
price
was
denied
you
.
<EOS>
The
man
who
has
done
these
things
must
never
expect
to
be
trusted
any
more
.
<EOS>
We
will
share
our
food
with
you
 
<EOS>
you
shall
have
a
bed
,
and
clothing
.
<EOS>
We
will
do
this
duty
to
you
,
because
you
are
our
father
.
<EOS>
But
you
will
never
be
trusted
.
<EOS>
You
are
an
evil
man
:
you
made
the
misery
of
our
mother
.
<EOS>
That
such
a
man
is
our
father
is
a
brand
on
our
flesh
which
will
not
cease
smarting
.
<EOS>
But
the
Eternal
has
laid
it
upon
us
;
and
though
human
justice
were
to
flog
you
for
crimes
,
and
your
body
fell
helpless
before
the
public
scorn
,
we
would
still
say
,
"
This
is
our
father
;
make
way
,
that
we
may
carry
him
out
of
your
sight
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
Lapidoth
,
in
adjusting
himself
to
what
was
coming
,
had
not
been
able
to
foresee
the
exact
intensity
of
the
lightning
or
the
exact
course
it
would
take
 
that
it
would
not
fall
outside
his
frame
but
through
it
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
foresee
what
was
so
new
to
him
as
this
voice
from
the
soul
of
his
son
.
<EOS>
It
touched
that
spring
of
hysterical
excitability
which
Mirah
used
to
witness
in
him
when
he
sat
at
home
and
sobbed
.
<EOS>
As
Ezra
ended
,
Lapidoth
threw
himself
into
a
chair
and
cried
like
a
woman
,
burying
his
face
against
the
table
 
and
yet
,
strangely
,
while
this
hysterical
crying
was
an
inevitable
reaction
in
him
under
the
stress
of
his
son
's
words
,
it
was
also
a
conscious
resource
in
a
difficulty
;
just
as
in
early
life
,
when
he
was
a
bright
-
faced
curly
young
man
,
he
had
been
used
to
avail
himself
of
this
subtly
-
poised
physical
susceptibility
to
turn
the
edge
of
resentment
or
disapprobation
.
  
<EOS>
Ezra
sat
down
again
and
said
nothing
 
exhausted
by
the
shock
of
his
own
irrepressible
utterance
,
the
outburst
of
feelings
which
for
years
he
had
borne
in
solitude
and
silence
.
<EOS>
His
thin
hands
trembled
on
the
arms
of
the
chair
;
he
would
hardly
have
found
voice
to
answer
a
question
;
he
felt
as
if
he
had
taken
a
step
toward
beckoning
Death
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
Mirah
's
quick
expectant
ear
detected
a
sound
which
her
heart
recognized
<EOS>
:
she
could
not
stay
out
of
the
room
any
longer
.
<EOS>
But
on
opening
the
door
her
immediate
alarm
was
for
Ezra
,
and
it
was
to
his
side
that
she
went
,
taking
his
trembling
hand
in
hers
,
which
he
pressed
and
found
support
in
;
but
he
did
not
speak
or
even
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
The
father
with
his
face
buried
was
conscious
that
Mirah
had
entered
,
and
presently
lifted
up
his
head
,
pressed
his
handkerchief
against
his
eyes
,
put
out
his
hand
toward
her
,
and
said
with
plaintive
hoarseness
,
"
Good
-
bye
,
Mirah
;
your
father
will
not
trouble
you
again
.
<EOS>
He
deserves
to
die
like
a
dog
by
the
roadside
,
and
he
will
.
<EOS>
If
your
mother
had
lived
,
she
would
have
forgiven
me
 
<EOS>
thirty
-
four
years
ago
I
put
the
ring
on
her
finger
under
the
_
Chuppa
_
,
and
we
were
made
one
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
forgiven
me
,
and
we
should
have
spent
our
old
age
together
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
n't
deserved
it
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
rose
from
the
chair
as
he
said
the
last
"
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
"
Mirah
had
put
her
hand
in
his
and
held
him
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
tearful
and
grieving
,
but
frightened
and
awe
-
struck
,
as
she
cried
out
    
"
No
,
father
,
no
!
"
<EOS>
Then
turning
to
her
brother
,
"
Ezra
,
you
have
not
forbidden
him
?
 
<EOS>
Stay
,
father
,
and
leave
off
wrong
things
.
<EOS>
Ezra
,
I
can
not
bear
it
.
<EOS>
How
can
I
say
to
my
father
,
"
Go
and
die
!
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
have
not
said
it
,
"
Ezra
answered
,
with
great
effort
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
said
,
stay
and
be
sheltered
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
will
stay
,
father
 
and
be
taken
care
of
 
and
come
with
me
,
"
said
Mirah
,
drawing
him
toward
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
really
what
Lapidoth
wanted
.
<EOS>
And
for
the
moment
he
felt
a
sort
of
comfort
in
recovering
his
daughter
's
dutiful
attendance
,
that
made
a
change
of
habits
seem
possible
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
led
him
down
to
the
parlor
below
,
and
said
    
"
This
is
my
sitting
-
room
when
I
am
not
with
Ezra
,
and
there
is
a
bed
-
room
behind
which
shall
be
yours
.
<EOS>
You
will
stay
and
be
good
,
father
.
<EOS>
Think
that
you
are
come
back
to
my
mother
,
and
that
she
has
forgiven
you
 
<EOS>
she
speaks
to
you
through
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mirah
's
tones
were
imploring
,
but
she
could
not
give
one
of
her
former
caresses
.
  
<EOS>
Lapidoth
quickly
recovered
his
composure
,
began
to
speak
to
Mirah
of
the
improvement
in
her
voice
,
and
other
easy
subjects
,
and
when
Mrs.
Adam
came
to
lay
out
his
supper
,
entered
into
converse
with
her
in
order
to
show
her
that
he
was
not
a
common
person
,
though
his
clothes
were
just
now
against
him
.
  
<EOS>
But
in
his
usual
wakefulness
at
night
,
he
fell
to
wondering
what
money
Mirah
had
by
her
,
and
went
back
over
old
Continental
hours
at
_
Roulette
_
,
reproducing
the
method
of
his
play
,
and
the
chances
that
had
frustrated
it
.
<EOS>
He
had
had
his
reasons
for
coming
to
England
,
but
for
most
things
it
was
a
cursed
country
.
  
<EOS>
These
were
the
stronger
visions
of
the
night
with
Lapidoth
,
and
not
the
worn
frame
of
his
ireful
son
uttering
a
terrible
judgment
.
<EOS>
Ezra
did
pass
across
the
gaming
-
table
,
and
his
words
were
audible
;
but
he
passed
like
an
insubstantial
ghost
,
and
his
words
had
the
heart
eaten
out
of
them
by
numbers
and
movements
that
seemed
to
make
the
very
tissue
of
Lapidoth
's
consciousness
.
      
<EOS>
The
godhead
in
us
wrings
our
noble
deeds
  
From
our
reluctant
selves
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
an
unpleasant
surprise
to
Deronda
when
he
returned
from
the
Abbey
to
find
the
undesirable
father
installed
in
the
lodgings
at
Brompton
.
<EOS>
Mirah
had
felt
it
necessary
to
speak
of
Deronda
to
her
father
,
and
even
to
make
him
as
fully
aware
as
she
could
of
the
way
in
which
the
friendship
with
Ezra
had
begun
,
and
of
the
sympathy
which
had
cemented
it
.
<EOS>
She
passed
more
lightly
over
what
Deronda
had
done
for
her
,
omitting
altogether
the
rescue
from
drowning
,
and
speaking
of
the
shelter
she
had
found
in
Mrs.
Meyrick
's
family
so
as
to
leave
her
father
to
suppose
that
it
was
through
these
friends
Deronda
had
become
acquainted
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
persuade
herself
to
more
completeness
in
her
narrative
:
<EOS>
she
could
not
let
the
breath
of
her
father
's
soul
pass
over
her
relation
to
Deronda
.
<EOS>
And
Lapidoth
,
for
reasons
,
was
not
eager
in
his
questioning
about
the
circumstances
of
her
flight
and
arrival
in
England
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
much
interested
in
the
fact
of
his
children
having
a
beneficent
friend
apparently
high
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
brother
who
told
Deronda
of
this
new
condition
added
to
their
life
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
become
calm
in
beholding
him
now
,
"
Ezra
ended
,
"
and
I
try
to
think
it
possible
that
my
sister
's
tenderness
,
and
the
daily
tasting
a
life
of
peace
,
may
win
him
to
remain
aloof
from
temptation
.
<EOS>
I
have
enjoined
her
,
and
she
has
promised
,
to
trust
him
with
no
money
.
<EOS>
I
have
convinced
her
that
he
will
buy
with
it
his
own
destruction
.
<EOS>
"
  
Deronda
first
came
on
the
third
day
from
Ladipoth
's
arrival
.
<EOS>
The
new
clothes
for
which
he
had
been
measured
were
not
yet
ready
,
and
wishing
to
make
a
favorable
impression
,
he
did
not
choose
to
present
himself
in
the
old
ones
.
<EOS>
He
watched
for
Deronda
's
departure
,
and
,
getting
a
view
of
him
from
the
window
,
was
rather
surprised
at
his
youthfulness
,
which
Mirah
had
not
mentioned
,
and
which
he
had
somehow
thought
out
of
the
question
in
a
personage
who
had
taken
up
a
grave
friendship
and
hoary
studies
with
the
sepulchral
Ezra
.
<EOS>
Lapidoth
began
to
imagine
that
Deronda
's
real
or
chief
motive
must
be
that
he
was
in
love
with
Mirah
.
<EOS>
And
so
much
the
better
;
for
a
tie
to
Mirah
had
more
promise
of
indulgence
for
her
father
than
a
tie
to
Ezra
:
and
Lapidoth
was
not
without
the
hope
of
recommending
himself
to
Deronda
,
and
of
softening
any
hard
prepossessions
.
<EOS>
He
was
behaving
with
much
amiability
,
and
trying
in
all
ways
at
his
command
to
get
himself
into
easy
domestication
with
his
children
 
entering
into
Mirah
's
music
,
showing
himself
docile
about
smoking
,
which
Mrs.
Adam
could
not
tolerate
in
her
parlor
,
and
walking
out
in
the
square
with
his
German
pipe
,
and
the
tobacco
with
which
Mirah
supplied
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
too
acute
to
offer
any
present
remonstrance
against
the
refusal
of
money
,
which
Mirah
told
him
that
she
must
persist
in
as
a
solemn
duty
promised
to
her
brother
.
<EOS>
He
was
comfortable
enough
to
wait
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
time
Deronda
came
,
Lapidoth
,
equipped
in
his
new
clothes
,
and
satisfied
with
his
own
appearance
,
was
in
the
room
with
Ezra
,
who
was
teaching
himself
,
as
a
part
of
his
severe
duty
,
to
tolerate
his
father
's
presence
whenever
it
was
imposed
.
<EOS>
Deronda
was
cold
and
distant
,
the
first
sight
of
this
man
,
who
had
blighted
the
lives
of
his
wife
and
children
,
creating
in
him
a
repulsion
that
was
even
a
physical
discomfort
.
<EOS>
But
Lapidoth
did
not
let
himself
be
discouraged
,
asked
leave
to
stay
and
hear
the
reading
of
papers
from
the
old
chest
,
and
actually
made
himself
useful
in
helping
to
decipher
some
difficult
German
manuscript
.
<EOS>
This
led
him
to
suggest
that
it
might
be
desirable
to
make
a
transcription
of
the
manuscript
,
and
he
offered
his
services
for
this
purpose
,
and
also
to
make
copies
of
any
papers
in
Roman
characters
.
<EOS>
Though
Ezra
's
young
eyes
he
observed
were
getting
weak
,
his
own
were
still
strong
.
<EOS>
Deronda
accepted
the
offer
,
thinking
that
Lapidoth
showed
a
sign
of
grace
in
the
willingness
to
be
employed
usefully
;
and
he
saw
a
gratified
expression
in
Ezra
's
face
,
who
,
however
,
presently
said
,
"
Let
all
the
writing
be
done
here
;
for
I
can
not
trust
the
papers
out
of
my
sight
,
lest
there
be
an
accident
by
burning
or
otherwise
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Poor
Ezra
felt
very
much
as
if
he
had
a
convict
on
leave
under
his
charge
.
<EOS>
Unless
he
saw
his
father
working
,
it
was
not
possible
to
believe
that
he
would
work
in
good
faith
.
<EOS>
But
by
this
arrangement
he
fastened
on
himself
the
burden
of
his
father
's
presence
,
which
was
made
painful
not
only
through
his
deepest
,
longest
associations
,
but
also
through
Lapidoth
's
restlessness
of
temperament
,
which
showed
itself
the
more
as
he
become
familiarized
with
his
situation
,
and
lost
any
awe
he
had
felt
of
his
son
.
<EOS>
The
fact
was
,
he
was
putting
a
strong
constraint
on
himself
in
confining
his
attention
for
the
sake
of
winning
Deronda
's
favor
;
and
like
a
man
in
an
uncomfortable
garment
he
gave
himself
relief
at
every
opportunity
,
going
out
to
smoke
,
or
moving
about
and
talking
,
or
throwing
himself
back
in
his
chair
and
remaining
silent
,
but
incessantly
carrying
on
a
dumb
language
of
facial
movement
or
gesticulation
:
and
if
Mirah
were
in
the
room
,
he
would
fall
into
his
old
habit
of
talk
with
her
,
gossiping
about
their
former
doings
and
companions
,
or
repeating
quirks
and
stories
,
and
plots
of
the
plays
he
used
to
adapt
,
in
the
belief
that
he
could
at
will
command
the
vivacity
of
his
earlier
time
.
<EOS>
All
this
was
a
mortal
infliction
to
Ezra
;
and
when
Mirah
was
at
home
she
tried
to
relieve
him
,
by
getting
her
father
down
into
the
parlor
and
keeping
watch
over
him
there
.
<EOS>
What
duty
is
made
of
a
single
difficult
resolve
?
<EOS>
The
difficulty
lies
in
the
daily
unflinching
support
of
consequences
that
mar
the
blessed
return
of
morning
with
the
prospect
of
irritation
to
be
suppressed
or
shame
to
be
endured
.
<EOS>
And
such
consequences
were
being
borne
by
these
,
as
by
many
other
heroic
children
of
an
unworthy
father
 
with
the
prospect
,
at
least
to
Mirah
,
of
their
stretching
onward
through
the
solid
part
of
life
.
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
Lapidoth
's
presence
had
raised
a
new
impalpable
partition
between
Deronda
and
Mirah
 
each
of
them
dreading
the
soiling
inferences
of
his
mind
,
each
of
them
interpreting
mistakenly
the
increased
reserve
and
diffidence
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
very
long
before
some
light
came
to
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
could
,
after
returning
from
his
brief
visit
to
the
Abbey
,
he
had
called
at
Hans
Meyrick
's
rooms
,
feeling
it
,
on
more
grounds
than
one
,
a
due
of
friendship
that
Hans
should
be
at
once
acquainted
with
the
reasons
of
his
late
journey
,
and
the
changes
of
intention
it
had
brought
about
.
<EOS>
Hans
was
not
there
;
he
was
said
to
be
in
the
country
for
a
few
days
;
and
Deronda
,
after
leaving
a
note
,
waited
a
week
,
rather
expecting
a
note
in
return
.
<EOS>
But
receiving
no
word
,
and
fearing
some
freak
of
feeling
in
the
incalculably
susceptible
Hans
,
whose
proposed
sojourn
at
the
Abbey
he
knew
had
been
deferred
,
he
at
length
made
a
second
call
,
and
was
admitted
into
the
painting
-
room
,
where
he
found
his
friend
in
a
light
coat
,
without
a
waistcoat
,
his
long
hair
still
wet
from
a
bath
,
but
with
a
face
looking
worn
and
wizened
 
anything
but
country
-
like
.
<EOS>
He
had
taken
up
his
palette
and
brushes
,
and
stood
before
his
easel
when
Deronda
entered
,
but
the
equipment
and
attitude
seemed
to
have
been
got
up
on
short
notice
.
  
<EOS>
As
they
shook
hands
,
Deronda
said
,
"
You
do
n't
look
much
as
if
you
had
been
in
the
country
,
old
fellow
.
<EOS>
Is
it
Cambridge
<EOS>
you
have
been
to
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Hans
,
curtly
,
throwing
down
his
palette
with
the
air
of
one
who
has
begun
to
feign
by
mistake
;
<EOS>
then
pushing
forward
a
chair
for
Deronda
,
he
threw
himself
into
another
,
and
leaned
backward
with
his
hands
behind
his
head
,
while
he
went
on
,
"
I
've
been
to
I
-
don't
<EOS>
-
know
-
where
 
No
man
's
land
 
and
a
mortally
unpleasant
country
it
is
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
you
have
been
drinking
,
Hans
,
"
said
Deronda
,
who
had
seated
himself
opposite
,
in
anxious
survey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
so
good
.
<EOS>
I
've
been
smoking
opium
.
<EOS>
I
always
meant
to
do
it
some
time
or
other
,
to
try
how
much
bliss
could
be
got
by
it
;
and
having
found
myself
just
now
rather
out
of
other
bliss
,
I
thought
it
judicious
to
seize
the
opportunity
.
<EOS>
But
I
pledge
you
my
word
<EOS>
I
shall
never
tap
a
cask
of
that
bliss
again
.
<EOS>
It
disagrees
with
my
constitution
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
has
been
the
matter
?
<EOS>
You
were
in
good
spirits
enough
when
you
wrote
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
nothing
in
particular
.
<EOS>
The
world
began
to
look
seedy
 
a
sort
of
cabbage
-
garden
with
all
the
cabbages
cut
.
<EOS>
A
malady
of
genius
,
you
may
be
sure
,
"
said
Hans
,
creasing
his
face
into
a
smile
;
"
and
,
in
fact
,
I
was
tired
of
being
virtuous
without
reward
,
especially
in
this
hot
London
weather
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Nothing
else
?
<EOS>
No
real
vexation
?
"
said
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
Hans
shook
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
came
to
tell
you
of
my
own
affairs
,
but
I
ca
n't
do
it
with
a
good
grace
if
you
are
to
hide
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Have
n't
an
affair
in
the
world
,
"
said
Hans
,
in
a
flighty
way
,
"
except
a
quarrel
with
a
bric
-
à
-
brac
man
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
as
it
is
the
first
time
in
our
lives
that
you
ever
spoke
to
me
about
your
own
affairs
,
you
are
only
beginning
to
pay
a
pretty
long
debt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
felt
convinced
that
Hans
was
behaving
artificially
,
but
he
trusted
to
a
return
of
the
old
frankness
by
-
and
-
by
if
he
gave
his
own
confidence
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
laughed
at
the
mystery
of
my
journey
to
Italy
,
Hans
,
"
he
began
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
for
an
object
that
touched
my
happiness
at
the
very
roots
.
<EOS>
I
had
never
known
anything
about
my
parents
,
and
I
really
went
to
Genoa
to
meet
my
mother
.
<EOS>
My
father
has
been
long
dead
 
died
when
I
was
an
infant
.
<EOS>
My
mother
was
the
daughter
of
an
eminent
Jew
;
my
father
was
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
Many
things
had
caused
me
to
think
of
this
origin
as
almost
a
probability
before
I
set
out
.
<EOS>
I
was
so
far
prepared
for
the
result
that
I
was
glad
of
it
 
glad
to
find
myself
a
Jew
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
expect
me
to
look
surprised
,
Deronda
,
"
said
Hans
,
who
had
changed
his
attitude
,
laying
one
leg
across
the
other
and
examining
the
heel
of
his

<EOS>
"
You
knew
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
mother
told
me
.
<EOS>
She
went
to
the
house
the
morning
after
you
had
been
there
 
brother
and
sister
both
told
her
.
<EOS>
You
may
imagine
we
ca
n't
rejoice
as
they
do
.
<EOS>
But
whatever
you
are
glad
of
,
I
shall
come
to
be
glad
of
in
the
end
 
<EOS>
_
when
_
<EOS>
exactly
the
end
may
be
I
ca
n't
predict
,
"
said
Hans
,
speaking
in
a
low
tone
,
which
was
as
usual
with
him
as
it
was
to
be
out
of
humor
with
his
lot
,
and
yet
bent
on
making
no
fuss
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
quite
understand
that
you
ca
n't
share
my
feeling
,
"
said
Deronda
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
let
silence
lie
between
us
on
what
casts
quite
a
new
light
over
my
future
.
<EOS>
I
have
taken
up
some
of
Mordecai
's
ideas
,
and
I
mean
to
try
and
carry
them
out
,
so
far
as
one
man
's
efforts
can
go
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
I
shall
by
and
by
travel
to
the
East
and
be
away
for
some
years
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hans
said
nothing
,
but
rose
,
seized
his
palette
and
began
to
work
his
brush
on
it
,
standing
before
his
picture
with
his
back
to
Deronda
,
who
also
felt
himself
at
a
break
in
his
path
embarrassed
by
Hans
's
embarrassment
.
  
<EOS>
Presently
Hans
said
,
again
speaking
low
,
and
without
turning
,
"
Excuse
the
question
,
but
does
Mrs.
Grandcourt
know
of
all
this
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
<EOS>
and
I
must
beg
of
you
,
Hans
,
"
said
Deronda
,
rather
angrily
,
"
to
cease
joking
on
that
subject
.
<EOS>
Any
notions
you
have
are
wide
of
the
truth
 
are
the
very
reverse
of
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
am
no
more
inclined
to
joke
than
I
shall
be
at
my
own
funeral
,
"
said
Hans
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
not
at
all
sure
that
you
are
aware
what
are
my
notions
on
that
subject
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Perhaps
not
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
But
let
me
say
,
once
for
all
,
that
in
relation
to
Mrs.
Grandcourt
,
I
never
have
had
,
and
never
shall
have
the
position
of
a
lover
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
ever
seriously
put
that
interpretation
on
anything
you
have
observed
,
you
are
supremely
mistaken
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
silence
a
little
while
,
and
to
each
the
silence
was
like
an
irritating
air
,
exaggerating
discomfort
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
have
been
mistaken
in
another
interpretation
,
also
,
"
said
Hans
,
presently
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
you
had
no
wish
to
hold
the
position
of
a
lover
toward
another
woman
,
who
is
neither
wife
nor
widow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
pretend
not
to
understand
you
,
Meyrick
.
<EOS>
It
is
painful
that
our
wishes
should
clash
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
tell
me
if
you
have
any
ground
for
supposing
that
you
would
succeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
seems
rather
a
superfluous
inquiry
on
your
part
,
Deronda
,
"
said
Hans
,
with
some
irritation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
superfluous
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
you
are
perfectly
convinced
on
the
subject
 
and
probably
have
had
the
very
best
evidence
to
convince
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
more
frank
with
you
than
you
are
with
me
,
"
said
Deronda
,
still
heated
by
Hans
'
show
of
temper
,
and
yet
sorry
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
had
the
slightest
evidence
that
I
should
succeed
myself
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
I
have
very
little
hope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hans
looked
round
hastily
at
his
friend
,
but
immediately
turned
to
his
picture
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
in
our
present
situation
,
"
said
Deronda
,
hurt
by
the
idea
that
Hans
suspected
him
of
insincerity
,
and
giving
an
offended
emphasis
to
his
words
,
"
I
do
n't
see
how
I
can
deliberately
make
known
my
feeling
to
her
.
<EOS>
If
she
could
not
return
it
,
I
should
have
embittered
her
best
comfort
;
for
neither
she
nor
I
can
be
parted
from
her
brother
,
and
we
should
have
to
meet
continually
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
to
cause
her
that
sort
of
pain
by
an
unwilling
betrayal
of
my
feeling
,
I
should
be
no
better
than
a
mischievous
animal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
I
have
ever
betrayed
_
<EOS>
my
_
feeling
to
her
,
"
said
Hans
,
as
if
he
were
vindicating
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
that
we
are
on
a
level
,
then
;
you
have
no
reason
to
envy
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
not
the
slightest
,
"
said
Hans
,
with
bitter
irony
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
measured
my
conceit
and
know
that
it
out
-
tops
all
your
advantages
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
nuisance
to
you
,
Meyrick
.
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
,
but
I
ca
n't
help
it
,
"
said
Deronda
,
rising
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
After
what
passed
between
us
before
,
I
wished
to
have
this
explanation
;
and
I
do
n't
see
that
any
pretensions
of
mine
have
made
a
real
difference
to
you
.
<EOS>
They
are
not
likely
to
make
any
pleasant
difference
to
myself
under
present
circumstances
.
<EOS>
Now
the
father
is
there
 
<EOS>
did
you
know
that
the
father
is
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
If
he
were
not
a
Jew
I
would
permit
myself
to
damn
him
 
with
faint
praise
,
I
mean
,
"
said
Hans
,
but
with
no
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
and
I
meet
under
greater
constraint
than
ever
.
<EOS>
Things
might
go
on
in
this
way
for
two
years
without
my
getting
any
insight
into
her
feeling
toward
me
.
<EOS>
That
is
the
whole
state
of
affairs
,
Hans
.
<EOS>
Neither
you
nor
I
have
injured
the
other
,
that
I
can
see
.
<EOS>
We
must
put
up
with
this
sort
of
rivalry
in
a
hope
that
is
likely
enough
to
come
to
nothing
.
<EOS>
Our
friendship
can
bear
that
strain
,
surely
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
it
ca
n't
,
"
said
Hans
,
impetuously
,
throwing
down
his
tools
,
thrusting
his
hands
into
his
coat
-
pockets
,
and
turning
round
to
face
Deronda
,
who
drew
back
a
little
and
looked
at
him
with
amazement
.
<EOS>
Hans
went
on
in
the
same
tone
    
<EOS>
"
Our
friendship
 
<EOS>
my
friendship
 
ca
n't
bear
the
strain
of
behaving
to
you
like
an
ungrateful
dastard
and
grudging
you
your
happiness
.
<EOS>
For
you
_
are
_
<EOS>
the
happiest
dog
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
If
Mirah
loves
anybody
better
than
her
brother
,
_
you
are
the
man
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hans
turned
on
his
heel
and
threw
himself
into
his
chair
,
looking
up
at
Deronda
with
an
expression
the
reverse
of
tender
.
<EOS>
Something
like
a
shock
passed
through
Deronda
,
and
<EOS>
,
after
an
instant
,
he
said
    
"
It
is
a
good
-
natured
fiction
of
yours
,
Hans
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
in
a
good
-
natured
mood
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
I
found
the
fact
disagreeable
when
it
was
thrust
on
me
 
all
the
more
,
or
perhaps
all
the
less
,
because
I
believed
then
that
your
heart
was
pledged
to
the
duchess
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
confound
you
!
<EOS>
you
turn
out
to
be
in
love
in
the
right
place
 
a
Jew
 
and
everything
eligible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
what
convinced
you
 
<EOS>
there
's
a
good
fellow
,
"
said
Deronda
,
distrusting
a
delight
that
he
was
unused
to
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
ask
.
<EOS>
Little
mother
was
witness
.
<EOS>
The
upshot
is
,
that
Mirah
is
jealous
of
the
duchess
,
and
the
sooner
you
relieve
your
mind
the
better
.
<EOS>
There
!
<EOS>
I
've
cleared
off
a
score
or
two
,
and
may
be
allowed
to
swear
at
you
for
getting
what
you
deserve
 
which
is
just
the
very
best
luck
I
know
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
,
Hans
!
"
said
Deronda
,
putting
out
his
hand
,
which
the
other
took
and
wrung
in
silence
.
      
<EOS>
"
All
thoughts
,
all
passions
,
all
delights
,
  
<EOS>
Whatever
stirs
this
mortal
frame
,

All
are
but
ministers
of
Love

And
feed
his
sacred

<EOS>
COLERIDGE
.
   
<EOS>
Deronda
's
eagerness
to
confess
his
love
could
hardly
have
had
a
stronger
stimulus
than
Hans
had
given
it
in
his
assurance
that
Mirah
needed
relief
from
jealousy
.
<EOS>
He
went
on
his
next
visit
to
Ezra
with
the
determination
to
be
resolute
in
using
 
nay
,
in
requesting
 
an
opportunity
of
private
conversation
with
her
.
<EOS>
If
she
accepted
his
love
,
he
felt
courageous
about
all
other
consequences
,
and
as
her
betrothed
husband
he
would
gain
a
protective
authority
which
might
be
a
desirable
defense
for
her
in
future
difficulties
with
her
father
.
<EOS>
Deronda
had
not
observed
any
signs
of
growing
restlessness
in
Lapidoth
,
or
of
diminished
desire
to
recommend
himself
;
but
he
had
forebodings
of
some
future
struggle
,
some
mortification
,
or
some
intolerable
increase
of
domestic
disquietude
in
which
he
might
save
Ezra
and
Mirah
from
being
helpless
victims
.
  
<EOS>
His
forebodings
would
have
been
strengthened
if
he
had
known
what
was
going
on
in
the
father
's
mind
.
<EOS>
That
amount
of
restlessness
,
that
desultoriness
of
attention
,
which
made
a
small
torture
to
Ezra
,
was
to
Lapidoth
an
irksome
submission
to
restraint
,
only
made
bearable
by
his
thinking
of
it
as
a
means
of
by
-
and
-
by
securing
a
well
-
conditioned
freedom
.
<EOS>
He
began
with
the
intention
of
awaiting
some
really
good
chance
,
such
as
an
opening
for
getting
a
considerable
sum
from
Deronda
;
but
all
the
while
he
was
looking
about
curiously
,
and
trying
to
discover
where
Mirah
deposited
her
money
and
her
keys
.
<EOS>
The
imperious
gambling
desire
within
him
,
which
carried
on
its
activity
through
every
other
occupation
,
and
made
a
continuous
web
of
imagination
that
held
all
else
in
its
meshes
,
would
hardly
have
been
under
the
control
of
a
contracted
purpose
,
if
he
had
been
able
to
lay
his
hands
on
any
sum
worth
capturing
.
<EOS>
But
Mirah
,
with
her
practical
clear
-
sightedness
,
guarded
against
any
frustration
of
the
promise
she
had
given
to
Ezra
,
by
confiding
all
money
,
except
what
she
was
immediately
in
want
of
,
to
Mrs.
Meyrick
's
care
,
and
Lapidoth
felt
himself
under
an
irritating
completeness
of
supply
in
kind
as
in
a
lunatic
asylum
where
everything
was
made
safe
against
him
.
<EOS>
To
have
opened
a
desk
or
drawer
of
Mirah
's
,
and
pocketed
any
bank
-
notes
found
there
,
would
have
been
to
his
mind
a
sort
of
domestic
appropriation
which
had
no
disgrace
in
it
;
the
degrees
of
liberty
a
man
allows
himself
with
other
people
's
property
being
often
delicately
drawn
,
even
beyond
the
boundary
where
the
law
begins
to
lay
its
hold
 
which
is
the
reason
why
spoons
are
a
safer
investment
than
mining
shares
.
<EOS>
Lapidoth
really
felt
himself
injuriously
treated
by
his
daughter
,
and
thought
that
he
ought
to
have
had
what
he
wanted
of
her
other
earnings
as
he
had
of
her
apple
-
tart
.
<EOS>
But
he
remained
submissive
;
indeed
,
the
indiscretion
that
most
tempted
him
,
was
not
any
insistance
with
Mirah
,
but
some
kind
of
appeal
to
Deronda
.
<EOS>
Clever
persons
who
have
nothing
else
to
sell
can
often
put
a
good
price
on
their
absence
,
and
Lapidoth
's
difficult
search
for
devices
forced
upon
him
the
idea
that
his
family
would
find
themselves
happier
without
him
,
and
that
Deronda
would
be
willing
to
advance
a
considerable
sum
for
the
sake
of
getting
rid
of
him
.
<EOS>
But
,
in
spite
of
well
-
practiced
hardihood
,
Lapidoth
was
still
in
some
awe
of
Ezra
's
imposing
friend
,
and
deferred
his
purpose
indefinitely
.
  
<EOS>
On
this
day
,
when
Deronda
had
come
full
of
a
gladdened
consciousness
,
which
inevitably
showed
itself
in
his
air
and
speech
,
Lapidoth
was
at
a
crisis
of
discontent
and
longing
that
made
his
mind
busy
with
schemes
of
freedom
,
and
Deronda
's
new
amenity
encouraged
them
.
<EOS>
This
pre
-
occupation
was
at
last
so
strong
as
to
interfere
with
his
usual
show
of
interest
in
what
went
forward
,
and
his
persistence
in
sitting
by
even
when
there
was
reading
which
he
could
not
follow
.
<EOS>
After
sitting
a
little
while
,
he
went
out
to
smoke
and
walk
in
the
square
,
and
the
two
friends
were
all
the
easier
.
<EOS>
Mirah
was
not
at
home
,
but
she
was
sure
to
be
in
again
before
Deronda
left
,
and
his
eyes
glowed
with
a
secret
anticipation
<EOS>
:
he
thought
that
when
he
saw
her
again
he
should
see
some
sweetness
of
recognition
for
himself
to
which
his
eyes
had
been
sealed
before
.
<EOS>
There
was
an
additional
playful
affectionateness
in
his
manner
toward
Ezra
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
little
room
is
too
close
for
you
,
Ezra
,
"
he
said
,
breaking
off
his
reading
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
week
's
heat
<EOS>
we
sometimes
get
here
<EOS>
is
worse
than
the
heat
in
Genoa
,
where
one
sits
in
the
shaded
coolness
of
large
rooms
.
<EOS>
You
must
have
a
better
home
now
.
<EOS>
I
shall
do
as
I
like
with
you
,
being
the
stronger
half
.
"
<EOS>
He
smiled
toward
Ezra
,
who
said
    
"
I
am
straitened
for
nothing
except
breath
.
<EOS>
But
you
,
who
might
be
in
a
spacious
palace
,
with
the
wide
green
country
around
you
,
find
this
a
narrow
prison
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
I
can
not
say
,
"
Go
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
,
the
country
would
be
a
banishment
while
you
are
here
,
"
said
Deronda
,
rising
and
walking
round
the
double
room
,
which
yet
offered
no
long
promenade
,
while
he
made
a
great
fan
of
his
handkerchief
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
happiest
room
in
the
world
to
me
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
will
imagine
myself
in
the
East
,
since
I
am
getting
ready
to
go
there
some
day
.
<EOS>
Only
I
will
not
wear
a
cravat
and
a
heavy
ring
there
,
"
he
ended
emphatically
,
pausing
to
take
off
those
superfluities
and
deposit
them
on
a
small
table
behind
Ezra
,
who
had
the
table
in
front
of
him
covered
with
books
and
papers
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
wearing
my
memorable
ring
ever
since
I
came
home
,
"
he
went
on
,
as
he
reseated
himself
.
"
<EOS>
But
I
am
such
a
Sybarite
that
I
constantly
put
it
off
as
a
burden
when
I
am
doing
anything
.
<EOS>
I
understand
why
the
Romans
had
summer
rings
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
if
_
they
had
them
.
<EOS>
Now
then
,
I
shall
get
on
better
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
soon
absorbed
in
their
work
again
.
<EOS>
Deronda
was
reading
a
piece
of
rabbinical
Hebrew
under
Ezra
's
correction
and
comment
,
and
they
took
little
notice
when
Lapidoth
re
-
entered
and
took
a
seat
somewhat
in
the
background
.
  
<EOS>
His
rambling
eyes
quickly
alighted
on
the
ring
that
sparkled
on
the
bit
of
dark
mahogany
.
<EOS>
During
his
walk
,
his
mind
had
been
occupied
with
the
fiction
of
an
advantageous
opening
for
him
abroad
,
only
requiring
a
sum
of
ready
money
,
which
,
on
being
communicated
to
Deronda
in
private
,
might
immediately
draw
from
him
a
question
as
to
the
amount
of
the
required
sum
:
and
it
was
this
part
of
his
forecast
that
Lapidoth
found
the
most
debatable
,
there
being
a
danger
in
asking
too
much
,
and
a
prospective
regret
in
asking
too
little
.
<EOS>
His
own
desire
gave
him
no
limit
,
and
he
was
quite
without
guidance
as
to
the
limit
of
Deronda
's
willingness
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
in
the
midst
of
these
airy
conditions
preparatory
to
a
receipt
which
remained
indefinite
,
this
ring
,
which
on
Deronda
's
finger
had
become
familiar
to
Lapidoth
's
envy
,
suddenly
shone
detached
and
within
easy
grasp
.
<EOS>
Its
value
was
certainly
below
the
smallest
of
the
imaginary
sums
that
his
purpose
fluctuated
between
;
but
then
it
was
before
him
as
a
solid
fact
,
and
his
desire
at
once
leaped
into
the
thought
(
not
yet
an
intention
)
that
if
he
were
quietly
to
pocket
that
ring
and
walk
away
he
would
have
the
means
of
comfortable
escape
from
present
restraint
,
without
trouble
,
and
also
without
danger
;
for
any
property
of
Deronda
's
(
available
without
his
formal
consent
)
was
all
one
with
his
children
's
property
,
since
their
father
would
never
be
prosecuted
for
taking
it
.
<EOS>
The
details
of
this
thinking
followed
each
other
so
quickly
that
they
seemed
to
rise
before
him
as
one
picture
.
<EOS>
Lapidoth
had
never
committed
larceny
;
but
larceny
is
a
form
of
appropriation
for
which
people
are
punished
by
law
;
and
,
take
this
ring
from
a
virtual
relation
,
who
would
have
been
willing
to
make
a
much
heavier
gift
,
would
not
come
under
the
head
of
larceny
.
<EOS>
Still
,
the
heavier
gift
was
to
be
preferred
,
if
Lapidoth
could
only
make
haste
enough
in
asking
for
it
,
and
the
imaginary
action
of
taking
the
ring
,
which
kept
repeating
itself
like
an
inward
tune
,
sank
into
a
rejected
idea
.
<EOS>
He
satisfied
his
urgent
longing
by
resolving
to
go
below
,
and
watch
for
the
moment
of
Deronda
's
departure
,
when
he
would
ask
leave
to
join
him
in
his
walk
and
boldly
carry
out
his
meditated
plan
.
<EOS>
He
rose
and
stood
looking
out
of
the
window
,
but
all
the
while
he
saw
what
lay
beyond
him
 
the
brief
passage
he
would
have
to
make
to
the
door
close
by
the
table
where
the
ring
was
.
<EOS>
However
he
was
resolved
to
go
down
;
but
 
by
no
distinct
change
of
resolution
,
rather
by
a
dominance
of
desire
,
like
the
thirst
of
the
drunkard
 
<EOS>
it
so
happened
that
in
passing
the
table
his
fingers
fell
noiselessly
on
the
ring
,
and
he
found
himself
in
the
passage
with
the
ring
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
It
followed
that
he
put
on
his
hat
and
quitted
the
house
.
<EOS>
The
possibility
of
again
throwing
himself
on
his
children
receded
into
the
indefinite
distance
,
and
before
he
was
out
on
the
square
his
sense
of
haste
had
concentrated
itself
on
selling
the
ring
and
getting
on
shipboard
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
and
Ezra
were
just
aware
of
his
exit
;
that
was
all
.
<EOS>
But
,
by
-
and
-
by
,
Mirah
came
in
and
made
a
real
interruption
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
taken
off
her
hat
;
and
when
Deronda
rose
and
advanced
to
shake
hands
with
her
,
she
said
,
in
a
confusion
at
once
unaccountable
and
troublesome
to
herself
    
<EOS>
"
I
only
came
in
to
see
that
Ezra
had
his
new
draught
.
<EOS>
I
must
go
directly
to
Mrs.
Meyrick
's
to
fetch
something
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
allow
me
to
walk
with
you
,
"
said
Deronda
urgently
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
not
tire
Ezra
any
further
;
besides
my
brains
are
melting
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
go
to
Mrs.
Meyrick
's
:
may
I
go
with
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
"
said
Mirah
,
blushing
still
more
,
with
the
vague
sense
of
something
new
in
Deronda
,
and
turning
away
to
pour
out
Ezra
's
draught
;
Ezra
meanwhile
throwing
back
his
head
with
his
eyes
shut
,
unable
to
get
his
mind
away
from
the
ideas
that
had
been
filling
it
while
the
reading
was
going
on
.
<EOS>
Deronda
for
a
moment
stood
thinking
of
nothing
but
the
walk
,
till
Mirah
turned
round
again
and
brought
the
draught
,
when
he
suddenly
remembered
that
he
had
laid
aside
his
cravat
,
and
saying
 
"
Pray
excuse
my
dishabille
 
I
did
not
mean
you
to
see
it
,
"
he
went
to
the
little
table
,
took
up
his
cravat
,
and
exclaimed
with
a
violent
impulse
of
surprise
,
"
Good
heavens
,
where
is
my
ring
gone
?
"
<EOS>
beginning
to
search
about
on
the
floor
.
  
<EOS>
Ezra
looked
round
the
corner
of
his
chair
.
<EOS>
Mirah
,
quick
as
thought
,
went
to
the
spot
where
Deronda
was
seeking
,
and
said
,
"
Did
you
lay
it
down
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Deronda
,
still
unvisited
by
any
other
explanation
than
that
the
ring
had
fallen
and
was
lurking
in
shadow
,
indiscernable
on
the
variegated
carpet
.
<EOS>
He
was
moving
the
bits
of
furniture
near
,
and
searching
in
all
possible
and
impossible
places
with
hand
and
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
But
another
explanation
had
visited
Mirah
and
taken
the
color
from
her
cheeks
.
<EOS>
She
went
to
Ezra
's
ear
and
whispered
"
<EOS>
Was
my
father
here
?
"
<EOS>
He
bent
his
head
in
reply
,
meeting
her
eyes
with
terrible
understanding
.
<EOS>
She
darted
back
to
the
spot
where
Deronda
was
still
casting
down
his
eyes
in
that
hopeless
exploration
which
are
apt
to
carry
on
over
a
space
we
have
examined
in
vain
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
found
it
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
,
hurriedly
.
  
<EOS>
He
,
meeting
her
frightened
gaze
,
immediately
caught
alarm
from
it
and
answered
,
"
I
perhaps
put
it
in
my
pocket
,
"
professing
to
feel
for
it
there
.
  
<EOS>
She
watched
him
and
said
,
"
It
is
not
there
?
 
<EOS>
you
put
it
on
the
table
,
"
with
a
penetrating
voice
that
would
not
let
him
feign
to
have
found
it
in
his
pocket
;
and
immediately
she
rushed
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
Deronda
followed
her
 
<EOS>
she
was
gone
into
the
sitting
-
room
below
to
look
for
her
father
 
<EOS>
she
opened
the
door
of
the
bedroom
to
see
if
he
were
there
 
<EOS>
she
looked
where
his
hat
usually
hung
 
<EOS>
she
turned
with
her
hands
<EOS>
clasped
tight
and
her
lips
pale
,
gazing
despairingly
out
of
the
window
.
<EOS>
Then
she
looked
up
at
Deronda
,
who
had
not
dared
to
speak
to
her
in
her
white
agitation
.
<EOS>
She
looked
up
at
him
,
unable
to
utter
a
word
 
<EOS>
the
look
seemed
a
tacit
acceptance
of
the
humiliation
she
felt
in
his
presence
.
<EOS>
But
he
,
taking
her
clasped
hands
between
both
his
,
said
,
in
a
tone
of
reverent
adoration
    
"
Mirah
,
let
me
think
that
he
is
my
father
as
well
as
yours
 
<EOS>
that
we
can
have
no
sorrow
,
no
disgrace
,
no
joy
apart
.
<EOS>
I
will
rather
take
your
grief
to
be
mine
than
I
would
take
the
brightest
joy
of
another
woman
.
<EOS>
Say
you
will
not
reject
me
 
say
you
will
take
me
to
share
all
things
with
you
.
<EOS>
Say
you
will
promise
to
be
my
wife
 
say
it
now
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
in
doubt
<EOS>
so
long
 
I
have
had
to
hide
my
love
so
long
.
<EOS>
Say
that
now
<EOS>
and
always
I
may
prove
to
you
that
I
love
you
with
complete
love
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
change
in
Mirah
had
been
gradual
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
passed
at
once
from
anguish
to
the
full
,
blessed
consciousness
that
,
in
this
moment
of
grief
and
shame
,
Deronda
was
giving
her
the
highest
tribute
man
can
give
to
woman
.
<EOS>
With
the
first
tones
and
the
first
words
,
she
had
only
a
sense
of
solemn
comfort
,
referring
this
goodness
of
Deronda
's
to
his
feeling
for
Ezra
.
<EOS>
But
by
degrees
the
rapturous
assurance
of
unhoped
-
for
good
took
possession
of
her
frame
:
her
face
glowed
under
Deronda
's
as
he
bent
over
her
;
yet
she
looked
up
still
with
intense
gravity
,
as
when
she
had
first
acknowledged
with
religious
gratitude
that
he
had
thought
her
"
worthy
of
the
best
;
"
and
when
he
had
finished
,
she
could
say
nothing
 
<EOS>
she
could
only
lift
up
her
lips
to
his
and
just
kiss
them
,
as
if
that
were
the
simplest
"
yes
.
<EOS>
"
They
stood
then
,
only
looking
at
each
other
,
he
holding
her
hands
between
his
 
too
happy
to
move
,
meeting
so
fully
in
their
new
consciousness
that
all
signs
would
have
seemed
to
throw
them
farther
apart
,
till
Mirah
said
in
a
whisper
:
"
Let
us
go
and
comfort
Ezra
.
"
      
<EOS>
"
The
human
nature
unto
which
I
felt
  
That
I
belonged
,
and
reverenced
with
love
,
  
<EOS>
Was
not
a
punctual
presence
,
but
a
spirit
  
Diffused
through
time
and
space
,
with
aid
derived
  
Of
evidence
from
monuments

erect
,
  
Prostrate
,
or
leaning
toward
their
common
rest

the

WORDSWORTH
:
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
The
Prelude
<EOS>
_
.
   
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
carried
out
his
plan
of
spending
part
of
the
autumn
at
Diplow
,
and
by
the
beginning
of
October
his
presence
was
spreading
some
cheerfulness
in
the
neighborhood
,
among
all
ranks
and
persons
concerned
,
from
the
stately
home
of
Brackenshaw
and
Quetcham
to
the
respectable
shop
-
parlors
in
Wanchester
.
<EOS>
For
Sir
Hugo
was
a
man
who
liked
to
show
himself
and
be
affable
,
a
Liberal
of
good
lineage
,
who
confided
entirely
in
reform
as
not
likely
to
make
any
serious
difference
in
English
habits
of
feeling
,
<EOS>
one
of
which
undoubtedly
is
the
liking
to
behold
society
well
fenced
and
adorned
with
hereditary
rank
.
<EOS>
Hence
he
made
Diplow
a
most
agreeable
house
,
extending
his
invitations
to
old
Wanchester
solicitors
and
young
village
curates
,
but
also
taking
some
care
in
the
combination
of
the
guests
,
and
not
feeding
all
the
common
poultry
together
,
so
that
they
should
think
their
meal
no
particular
compliment
.
<EOS>
Easy
-
going
Lord
Brackenshaw
,
for
example
,
would
not
mind
meeting
Robinson
the
attorney
,
but
Robinson
would
have
been
naturally
piqued
if
he
had
been
asked
to
meet
a
set
of
people
who
passed
for
his
equals
.
<EOS>
On
all
these
points
Sir
Hugo
was
well
informed
enough
at
once
to
gain
popularity
for
himself
and
give
pleasure
to
others
 
two
results
which
eminently
suited
his
disposition
.
<EOS>
The
rector
of
Pennicote
now
found
a
reception
at
Diplow
very
different
from
the
haughty
tolerance
he
had
undergone
during
the
reign
of
Grandcourt
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
that
the
baronet
liked
Mr.
Gascoigne
;
it
was
that
he
desired
to
keep
up
a
marked
relation
of
friendliness
with
him
on
account
of
Mrs.
Grandcourt
,
for
whom
Sir
Hugo
's
chivalry
had
become
more
and
more
engaged
.
<EOS>
Why
?
<EOS>
The
chief
reason
was
one
that
he
could
not
fully
communicate
,
even
to
<EOS>
Lady
Mallinger
 
<EOS>
for
he
would
not
tell
what
he
thought
one
woman
's
secret
to
another
,
even
though
the
other
was
his
wife
 
which
shows
that
his
chivalry
included
a
rare
reticence
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
,
after
he
had
become
engaged
to
Mirah
,
felt
it
right
to
make
a
full
statement
of
his
position
and
purposes
to
Sir
Hugo
,
and
he
chose
to
make
it
by
letter
.
<EOS>
He
had
more
than
a
presentiment
that
his
fatherly
friend
would
feel
some
dissatisfaction
,
if
not
pain
,
at
this
turn
of
his
destiny
.
<EOS>
In
reading
unwelcome
news
,
instead
of
hearing
it
,
there
is
the
advantage
that
one
avoids
a
hasty
expression
of
impatience
which
may
afterward
be
repented
of
.
<EOS>
Deronda
dreaded
that
verbal
collision
which
makes
otherwise
pardonable
feeling
lastingly
offensive
.
  
<EOS>
And
Sir
Hugo
,
though
not
altogether
surprised
,
was
thoroughly
vexed
.
<EOS>
His
immediate
resource
was
to
take
the
letter
to
Lady
Mallinger
,
who
would
be
sure
to
express
an
astonishment
which
her
husband
could
argue
against
as
unreasonable
,
and
in
this
way
divide
the
stress
of
his
discontent
.
<EOS>
And
in
fact
when
she
showed
herself
astonished
and
distressed
that
all
Daniel
's
wonderful
talents
,
and
the
comfort
of
having
him
in
the
house
,
should
have
ended
in
his
going
mad
in
this
way
about
the
Jews
,
the
baronet
could
say
    
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
nonsense
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
depend
upon
it
,
Dan
will
not
make
a
fool
of
himself
.
<EOS>
He
has
large

"
  
<EOS>
But
with
regard
to
the
prospective
marriage
she
afforded
him
no
counter
-
irritant
.
<EOS>
The
gentle
lady
observed
,
without
rancor
,
that
she
had
little
dreamed
of
what
was
coming
when
she
had
Mirah
to
sing
at
her
musical
party
and
give
lessons
to
Amabel
.
<EOS>
After
some
hesitation
,
indeed
,
she
confessed
it
_
had
_
passed
through
her
mind
that
after
a
proper
time
Daniel
might
marry
Mrs.
Grandcourt
 
because
it
seemed
so
remarkable
that
he
should
be
at
Genoa
just
at
that
time
 
<EOS>
and
although
she
herself
was
not
fond
of
widows
she
could
not
help
thinking
that
such
a
marriage
would
have
been
better
than
his
going
altogether
with
the
Jews
.
<EOS>
But
Sir
Hugo
was
so
strongly
of
the
same
opinion
that
he
could
not
correct
it
as
a
feminine
mistake
;
and
his
ill
-
humor
at
the
disproof
of
his
disagreeable
conclusions
on
behalf
of
Gwendolen
was
left
without
vent
.
<EOS>
He
desired
Lady
Mallinger
not
to
breathe
a
word
about
the
affair
till
further
notice
,
saying
to
himself
,
"
If
it
is
an
unkind
cut
to
the
poor
thing
(
meaning
Gwendolen
)
,
the
longer
she
is
without
knowing
it
the
better
,
in
her
present
nervous
state
.
<EOS>
And
she
will
best
learn
it
from
Dan
himself
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
's
conjectures
had
worked
so
industriously
with
his
knowledge
,
that
he
fancied
himself
well
informed
concerning
the
whole
situation
.
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
his
residence
with
his
family
at
Diplow
enabled
him
to
continue
his
fatherly
attentions
to
Gwendolen
;
and
in
these
Lady
Mallinger
,
notwithstanding
her
small
liking
for
widows
,
was
quite
willing
to
second
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
plan
of
removal
to
Offendene
had
been
carried
out
;
and
Gwendolen
,
in
settling
there
,
maintained
a
calm
beyond
her
mother
's
hopes
.
<EOS>
She
was
experiencing
some
of
that
peaceful
melancholy
which
comes
from
the
renunciation
of
demands
for
self
,
and
from
taking
the
ordinary
good
of
existence
,
and
especially
kindness
,
even
from
a
dog
,
as
a
gift
above
expectation
.
<EOS>
Does
one
who
has
been
all
but
lost
in
a
pit
of
darkness
complain
of
the
sweet
air
and
the
daylight
?
<EOS>
There
is
a
way
of
looking
at
our
life
daily
as
an
escape
,
and
taking
the
quiet
return
of
morn
and
evening
 
still
more
the
star
-
like
out
-
glowing
of
some
pure
fellow
-
feeling
,
some
generous
impulse
breaking
our
inward
darkness
 
as
a
salvation
that
reconciles
us
to
hardship
.
<EOS>
Those
who
have
a
self
-
knowledge
prompting
such
self
-
accusation
as
Hamlet
's
,
can
understand
this
habitual
feeling
of
rescue
.
<EOS>
And
it
was
felt
by
Gwendolen
as
she
lived
through
and
through
again
the
terrible
history
of
her
temptations
,
from
their
first
form
of
illusory
self
-
pleasing
when
she
struggled
away
from
the
hold
of
conscience
,
to
their
latest
form
of
an
urgent
hatred
dragging
her
toward
its
satisfaction
,
while
she
prayed
and
cried
for
the
help
of
that
conscience
which
she
had
once
forsaken
.
<EOS>
She
was
now
dwelling
on
every
word
of
Deronda
's
that
pointed
to
her
past
deliverance
from
the
worst
evil
in
herself
,
and
the
worst
infliction
of
it
on
others
,
and
on
every
word
that
carried
a
force
to
resist
self
-
despair
.
  
<EOS>
But
she
was
also
upborne
by
the
prospect
of
soon
seeing
him
again
:
she
did
not
imagine
him
otherwise
than
always
within
her
reach
,
her
supreme
need
of
him
blinding
her
to
the
separateness
of
his
life
,
the
whole
scene
of
which
she
filled
with
his
relation
to
her
 
no
unique
preoccupation
of
Gwendolen
's
,
for
we
are
all
apt
to
fall
into
this
passionate
egoism
of
imagination
,
not
only
toward
our
fellow
-
men
,
but
toward
God
.
<EOS>
And
the
future
which
she
turned
her
face
to
with
a
willing
step
was
one
where
she
would
be
continually
assimilating
herself
to
some
type
that
he
would
hold
before
her
.
<EOS>
Had
he
not
first
risen
on
her
vision
as
a
corrective
presence
which
she
had
recognized
in
the
beginning
with
resentment
,
and
at
last
with
entire
love
and
trust
?
<EOS>
She
could
not
spontaneously
think
of
an
end
to
that
reliance
,
which
had
become
to
her
imagination
like
the
firmness
of
the
earth
,
the
only
condition
of
her
walking
.
  
<EOS>
And
Deronda
was
not
long
before
he
came
to
Diplow
,
which
was
a
more
convenient
distance
from
town
than
the
Abbey
.
<EOS>
He
had
wished
to
carry
out
a
plan
for
taking
Ezra
and
Mirah
to
a
mild
spot
on
the
coast
,
while
he
prepared
another
home
which
Mirah
might
enter
as
his
bride
,
and
where
they
might
unitedly
watch
over
her
brother
.
<EOS>
But
Ezra
begged
not
to
be
removed
,
unless
it
were
to
go
with
them
to
the
East
.
<EOS>
All
outward
solicitations
were
becoming
more
and
more
of
a
burden
to
him
;
but
his
mind
dwelt
on
the
possibility
of
this
voyage
with
a
visionary
joy
.
<EOS>
Deronda
,
in
his
preparations
for
the
marriage
,
which
he
hoped
might
not
be
deferred
beyond
a
couple
of
months
,
wished
to
have
fuller
consultation
as
to
his
resources
and
affairs
generally
with
Sir
Hugo
,
and
here
was
a
reason
for
not
delaying
his
visit
to
Diplow
.
<EOS>
But
he
thought
quite
as
much
of
another
reason
 
his
promise
to
Gwendolen
.
<EOS>
The
sense
of
blessedness
in
his
own
lot
had
yet
an
aching
anxiety
at
his
heart
:
this
may
be
held
paradoxical
,
for
the
beloved
lover
is
always
called
happy
,
and
happiness
is
considered
as
a
well
-
fleshed
indifference
to
sorrow
outside
it
.
<EOS>
But
human
experience
is
usually
paradoxical
,
if
that
means
incongruous
with
the
phrases
of
current
talk
or
even
current
philosophy
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
treason
to
Mirah
,
but
a
part
of
that
full
nature
which
made
his
love
for
her
the
more
worthy
,
that
his
joy
in
her
could
hold
by
its
side
the
care
for
another
.
<EOS>
For
what
is
love
itself
,
for
the
one
we
love
best
?
 
<EOS>
an
enfolding
of
immeasurable
cares
which
yet
are
better
than
any
joys
outside
our
love
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
came
twice
to
Diplow
,
and
saw
Gwendolen
twice
 
<EOS>
and
yet
he
went
back
to
town
without
having
told
her
anything
about
the
change
in
his
lot
and
prospects
.
<EOS>
He
blamed
himself
;
but
in
all
momentous
communication
likely
to
give
pain
<EOS>
we
feel
dependent
on
some
preparatory
turn
of
words
or
associations
,
some
agreement
of
the
other
's
mood
with
the
probable
effect
of
what
we
have
to
impart
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
interview
Gwendolen
was
so
absorbed
in
what
she
had
to
say
to
him
,
so
full
of
questions
which
he
must
answer
,
about
the
arrangement
of
her
life
,
what
she
could
do
to
make
herself
less
ignorant
,
how
she
could
be
kindest
to
everybody
,
and
make
amends
for
her
selfishness
and
try
to
be
rid
of
it
,
that
Deronda
utterly
shrank
from
waiving
her
immediate
wants
in
order
to
speak
of
himself
,
nay
,
from
inflicting
a
wound
on
her
in
these
moments
when
she
was
leaning
on
him
for
help
in
her
path
.
<EOS>
In
the
second
interview
,
when
he
went
with
new
resolve
to
command
the
conversation
into
some
preparatory
track
,
he
found
her
in
a
state
of
deep
depression
,
overmastered
by
some
distasteful
miserable
memories
which
forced
themselves
on
her
as
something
more
real
and
ample
than
any
new
material
out
of
which
she
could
mould
her
future
.
<EOS>
She
cried
hysterically
,
and
said
that
he
would
always
despise
her
.
<EOS>
He
could
only
seek
words
of
soothing
and
encouragement
:
and
when
she
gradually
revived
under
them
,
with
that
pathetic
look
of
renewed
childlike
interest
which
we
see
in
eyes
where
the
lashes
are
still
beaded
with
tears
,
it
was
impossible
to
lay
another
burden
on
her
.
  
<EOS>
But
time
went
on
,
and
he
felt
it
a
pressing
duty
to
make
the
difficult
disclosure
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
,
it
was
true
,
never
recognized
his
having
any
affairs
;
and
it
had
never
even
occurred
to
her
to
ask
him
why
he
happened
to
be
at
Genoa
.
<EOS>
But
this
unconsciousness
of
hers
would
make
a
sudden
revelation
of
affairs
that
were
determining
his
course
in
life
all
the
heavier
blow
to
her
;
and
if
he
left
the
revelation
to
be
made
by
different
persons
,
she
would
feel
that
he
had
treated
her
with
cruel
inconsiderateness
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
make
the
communication
in
writing
:
his
tenderness
could
not
bear
to
think
of
her
reading
his
virtual
farewell
in
solitude
,
and
perhaps
feeling
his
words
full
of
a
hard
gladness
for
himself
and
indifference
for
her
.
<EOS>
He
went
down
to
Diplow
again
,
feeling
that
every
other
peril
was
to
be
incurred
rather
than
that
of
returning
and
leaving
her
still
in
ignorance
.
  
<EOS>
On
this
third
visit
Deronda
found
Hans
Meyrick
installed
with
his
easel
at
Diplow
,
beginning
his
picture
of
the
three
daughters
sitting
on
a
bank
,
"
in
the
Gainsborough
style
,
"
and
varying
his
work
by
rambling
to
Pennicote
to
sketch
the
village
children
and
improve
his
acquaintance
with
the
Gascoignes
.
<EOS>
Hans
appeared
to
have
recovered
his
vivacity
,
but
Deronda
detected
some
feigning
in
it
,
as
we
detect
the
artificiality
of
a
lady
's
bloom
from
its
being
a
little
too
high
-
toned
and
steadily
persistent
(
a
"
Fluctuating
Rouge
"
not
having
yet
appeared
among
the
advertisements
)
.
<EOS>
Also
with
all
his
grateful
friendship
and
admiration
for
Deronda
,
Hans
could
not
help
a
certain
irritation
against
him
,
such
as
extremely
incautious
,
open
natures
are
apt
to
feel
when
the
breaking
of
a
friend
's
reserve
discloses
a
state
of
things
not
merely
unsuspected
but
the
reverse
of
what
had
been
hoped
and
ingeniously
conjectured
.
<EOS>
It
is
true
that
poor
Hans
had
always
cared
chiefly
to
confide
in
Deronda
,
and
had
been
quite
incurious
as
to
any
confidence
that
might
have
been
given
in
return
;
but
what
outpourer
of
his
own
affairs
is
not
tempted
to
think
any
hint
of
his
friend
's
affairs
is
an
egotistic
irrelevance
?
<EOS>
That
was
no
reason
why
it
was
not
rather
a
sore
reflection
to
Hans
that
while
he
had
been
all
along
naively
opening
his
heart
about
Mirah
,
Deronda
had
kept
secret
a
feeling
of
rivalry
which
now
revealed
itself
as
the
important
determining
fact
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
it
is
always
at
their
peril
that
our
friends
turn
out
to
be
something
more
than
we
were
aware
of
.
<EOS>
Hans
must
be
excused
for
these
promptings
of
bruised
sensibility
,
since
he
had
not
allowed
them
to
govern
his
substantial
conduct
:
he
had
the
consciousness
of
having
done
right
by
his
fortunate
friend
;
or
,
as
he
told
himself
,
"
his
metal
had
given
a
better
ring
than
he
would
have
sworn
to
beforehand
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
Hans
had
always
said
that
in
point
of
virtue
he
was
a
_
dilettante
_
:
which
meant
that
he
was
very
fond
of
it
in
other
people
,
but
if
he
meddled
with
it
himself
he
cut
a
poor
figure
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
in
reward
of
his
good
behavior
he
gave
his
tongue
the
more
freedom
;
and
he
was
too
fully
possessed
by
the
notion
of
Deronda
's
happiness
to
have
a
conception
of
what
he
was
feeling
about
Gwendolen
,
so
that
he
spoke
of
her
without
hesitation
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
did
you
come
down
,
Hans
?
"
said
Deronda
,
joining
him
in
the
grounds
where
he
was
making
a
study
of
the
requisite
bank
and
trees
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
ten
days
ago
<EOS>
;
before
the
time
Sir
Hugo
fixed
.
<EOS>
I
ran
down
with
Rex
Gascoigne
and
stayed
at
the
rectory
a
day
or
two
.
<EOS>
I
'm
up
in
all
the
gossip
of
these
parts
;
I
know
the
state
of
the
wheelwright
's
interior
,
and
have
assisted
at
an
infant
school
examination
.
<EOS>
Sister
Anna
,
with
the
good
upper
lip
,
escorted
me
,
else
I
should
have
been
mobbed
by
three
urchins
and
an
idiot
,
because
of
my
long
hair
and
a
general
appearance
which
departs
from
the
Pennicote
type
of
the
beautiful
.
<EOS>
Altogether
,
the
village
is
idyllic
.
<EOS>
Its
only
fault
is
a
dark
curate
with
broad
shoulders
and
broad
trousers
who
ought
to
have
gone
into
the
heavy
drapery
line
.
<EOS>
The
Gascoignes
are
perfect
 
besides
being
related
to
the
Vandyke
duchess
.
<EOS>
I
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
in
her
black
robes
at
a
distance
,
though
she
does
n't
show
to
visitors
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
was
not
staying
at
the
rectory
?
"
said
Deronda
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
but
I
was
taken
to
Offendene
to
see
the
old
house
,
and
as
a
consequence
I
saw
the
duchess
'
family
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
have
been
there
and
know
all
about
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
have
been
there
,
"
said
Deronda
,
quietly
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
fine
old
place
.
<EOS>
An
excellent
setting
for
a
widow
with
romantic
fortunes
.
<EOS>
And
she
seems
to
have
had
several
romances
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
found
out
that
there
was
one
between
her
and
my
friend
Rex
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
long
before
her
marriage
,
then
?
"
said
Deronda
,
really
interested
,
"
for
they
had
only
been
a
year
at
Offendene
.
<EOS>
How
came
you
to
know
anything
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
 
not
ignorant
of
what
it
is
to
be
a
miserable
devil
,
I
learn
to
gloat
on
the
signs
of
misery
in
others
.
<EOS>
I
found
out
that
Rex
never
goes
to
Offendene
,
and
has
never
seen
the
duchess
since
she
came
back
;
and
Miss
Gascoigne
let
fall
something
in
our
talk
about
charade
-
acting
 
for
<EOS>
I
went
through
some
of
my
nonsense
to
please
the
young
ones
 
something
that
proved
to
me
that
Rex
was
once
hovering
about
his
fair
cousin
<EOS>
close
enough
to
get
singed
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
was
her
part
in
the
affair
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
duke
came
in
and
carried
her
off
.
<EOS>
That
is
always
the
way
when
an
exceptionally
worthy
young
man
forms
an
attachment
.
<EOS>
I
understand
now
why
Gascoigne
talks
of
making
the
law
his
mistress
and
remaining
a
bachelor
.
<EOS>
But
these
are
green
resolves
.
<EOS>
Since
the
duke
did
not
get
himself
drowned
for
your
sake
,
it
may
turn
out
to
be
for
my
friend
Rex
's
sake
.
<EOS>
Who
knows
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
absolutely
necessary
that
Mrs.
Grandcourt
should
marry
again
?
"
said
Deronda
,
ready
to
add
that
Hans
's
success
in
constructing
her
fortunes
hitherto
had
not
been
enough
to
warrant
a
new
attempt
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
monster
!
"
<EOS>
retorted
Hans
,
"
do
you
want
her
to
wear
weeds
for
_
<EOS>
you
_
<EOS>
all
her
life
 
burn
herself
in
perpetual
suttee
while
you
are
alive
and
merry
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
could
say
nothing
,
but
he
looked
so
much
annoyed
that
Hans
turned
the
current
of
his
chat
,
and
when
he
was
alone
shrugged
his
shoulders
a
little
over
the
thought
that
there
really
had
been
some
stronger
feeling
between
Deronda
and
the
duchess
than
Mirah
would
like
to
know
of
.
<EOS>
"
Why
did
n't
she
fall
in
love
with
me
?
"
<EOS>
thought
Hans
,
laughing
at
himself
.
<EOS>
"
She
would
have
had
no
rivals
.
<EOS>
No
woman
ever
wanted
to
discuss
theology
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
No
wonder
that
Deronda
winced
under
that
sort
of
joking
with
a
whip
-
lash
.
<EOS>
It
touched
sensibilities
that
were
already
quivering
with
the
anticipation
of
witnessing
some
of
that
pain
to
which
even
Hans
's
light
words
seemed
to
give
more
reality
:
 
any
sort
of
recognition
by
another
giving
emphasis
to
the
subject
of
our
anxiety
.
<EOS>
And
now
he
had
come
down
with
the
firm
resolve
that
he
would
not
again
evade
the
trial
.
<EOS>
The
next
day
he
rode
to
Offendene
.
<EOS>
He
had
sent
word
that
he
intended
to
call
and
to
ask
if
Gwendolen
could
receive
him
;
and
he
found
her
awaiting
him
in
the
old
drawing
-
room
where
some
chief
crises
of
her
life
had
happened
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
less
sad
than
he
had
seen
her
since
her
husband
's
death
;
there
was
no
smile
on
her
face
,
but
a
placid
self
-
possession
,
in
contrast
with
the
mood
in
which
he
had
last
found
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
all
the
more
alive
to
the
sadness
perceptible
in
Deronda
;
and
they
were
no
sooner
seated
 
he
at
a
little
distance
opposite
to
her
 
than
she
said
:
  
<EOS>
"
You
were
afraid
of
coming
to
see
me
,
because
I
was
so
full
of
grief
and
despair
the
last
time
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
not
so
today
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
sorry
ever
since
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
making
it
a
reason
why
I
should
keep
up
my
hope
and
be
as
cheerful
as
I
can
,
because
I
would
not
give
you
any
pain
about
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
an
unwonted
sweetness
in
Gwendolen
's
tone
and
look
as
she
uttered
these
words
that
seemed
to
Deronda
to
infuse
the
utmost
cruelty
into
the
task
now
laid
upon
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
felt
obliged
to
make
his
answer
a
beginning
of
the
task
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
_
am
_
in
some
trouble
to
-
day
,
"
he
said
,
looking
at
her
rather
mournfully
;
"
but
it
is
because
I
have
things
to
tell
you
which
you
will
almost
think
it
a
want
of
confidence
on
my
part
not
to
have
spoken
of
before
.
<EOS>
They
are
things
affecting
my
own
life
 
my
own
future
.
<EOS>
I
shall
seem
to
have
made
an
ill
return
to
you
for
the
trust
you
have
placed
in
me
 
never
to
have
given
you
an
idea
of
events
that
make
great
changes
for
me
.
<EOS>
But
when
we
have
been
together
we
have
hardly
had
time
to
enter
into
subjects
which
at
the
moment
were
really
less
pressing
to
me
than
the
trials
you
have
been
going
through
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
sort
of
timid
tenderness
in
Deronda
's
deep
tones
,
and
he
paused
with
a
pleading
look
,
as
if
it
had
been
Gwendolen
only
who
had
conferred
anything
in
her
scenes
of
beseeching
and
confession
.
  
<EOS>
A
thrill
of
surprise
was
visible
in
her
.
<EOS>
Such
meaning
as
she
found
in
his
words
had
shaken
her
,
but
without
causing
fear
.
<EOS>
Her
mind
had
flown
at
once
to
some
change
in
his
position
with
regard
to
Sir
Hugo
and
Sir
Hugo
's
property
.
<EOS>
She
said
,
with
a
sense
of
comfort
from
Deronda
's
way
of
asking
her
pardon
    
<EOS>
"
You
never
thought
of
anything
<EOS>
but
what
you
could
do
to
help
me
;
and
I
was
so
troublesome
.
<EOS>
How
could
you
tell
me
things
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
perhaps
astonish
you
,
"
said
Deronda
,
"
that
I
have
only
quite
lately
known
who
were
my
parents
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
was
not
astonished
:
she
felt
the
more
assured
that
her
expectations
of
what
was
coming
were
right
.
<EOS>
Deronda
went
on
without
check
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
reason
why
you
found
me
in
Italy
was
that
I
had
gone
there
to
learn
that
 
in
fact
,
to
meet
my
mother
.
<EOS>
It
was
by
her
wish
that
I
was
brought
up
in
ignorance
of
my
parentage
.
<EOS>
She
parted
with
me
after
my
father
's
death
,
when
I
was
a
little
creature
.
<EOS>
But
she
is
now
very
ill
,
and
she
felt
that
the
secrecy
ought
not
to
be
any
longer
maintained
.
<EOS>
Her
chief
reason
had
been
that
she
did
not
wish
me
to
know
I
was
a
Jew
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
_
A
Jew
_
!
"
<EOS>
Gwendolen
exclaimed
,
in
a
low
tone
of
amazement
,
with
an
utterly
frustrated
look
,
as
if
some
confusing
potion
were
creeping
through
her
system
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
colored
,
and
did
not
speak
,
while
Gwendolen
,
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
floor
,
was
struggling
to
find
her
way
in
the
dark
by
the
aid
of
various
reminiscences
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
at
last
to
have
arrived
at
some
judgment
,
for
she
looked
up
at
Deronda
again
and
said
,
as
if
remonstrating
against
the
mother
's
conduct
    
<EOS>
"
What
difference
need
that
have
made
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
has
made
a
great
difference
to
me
that
I
have
known
it
,
"
said
Deronda
,
emphatically
;
but
he
could
not
go
on
easily
 
the
distance
between
her
ideas
and
his
acted
like
a
difference
of
native
language
,
making
him
uncertain
what
force
his
words
would
carry
.
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
meditated
again
,
and
then
said
feelingly
,
"
I
hope
there
is
nothing
to
make
you
mind
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
You
_
are
just
the
same
as
if
you
were
not
a
Jew
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
meant
to
assure
him
that
nothing
of
that
external
sort
could
affect
the
way
in
which
she
regarded
him
,
or
the
way
in
which
he
could
influence
her
.
<EOS>
Deronda
was
a
little
helped
by
this
misunderstanding
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
discovery
was
far
from
being
painful
to
me
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
had
been
gradually
prepared
for
it
,
and
I
was
glad
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
had
been
prepared
for
it
by
becoming
intimate
with
a
very
remarkable
Jew
,
whose
ideas
have
attracted
me
so
much
that
I
think
of
devoting
the
best
part
of
my
life
to
some
effort
at
giving
them
effect
.
"
  
<EOS>
Again
Gwendolen
seemed
shaken
 
again
there
was
a
look
of
frustration
,
but
this
time
it
was
mingled
with
alarm
.
<EOS>
She
looked
at
Deronda
with
lips
childishly
parted
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
that
she
had
yet
connected
his
words
with
Mirah
and
her
brother
,
but
that
they
had
inspired
her
with
a
dreadful
presentiment
of
mountainous
travel
for
her
mind
before
it
could
reach
Deronda
's
.
<EOS>
Great
ideas
in
general
which
she
had
attributed
to
him
seemed
to
make
no
great
practical
difference
,
and
were
not
formidable
in
the
same
way
as
these
mysteriously
-
shadowed
particular
ideas
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
quite
divine
what
was
going
on
within
her
;
he
could
only
seek
the
least
abrupt
path
of
disclosure
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
an
object
,
"
he
said
,
after
a
moment
,
"
which
will
by
-
and
-
by
force
me
to
leave
England
for
some
time
 
for
some
years
.
<EOS>
I
have
purposes
which
will
take
me
to
the
East
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Here
was
something
clearer
,
but
all
the
more
immediately
agitating
.
<EOS>
Gwendolen
's
lips
began
to
tremble
.
"
<EOS>
But
you
will
come
back
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
,
tasting
her
own
tears
as
they
fell
,
before
she
thought
of
drying
them
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
could
not
sit
still
.
<EOS>
He
rose
,
and
went
to
prop
himself
against
the
corner
of
the
mantel
-
piece
,
at
a
different
angle
from
her
face
.
<EOS>
But
when
she
had
pressed
her
handkerchief
against
her
cheeks
,
she
turned
and
looked
up
at
him
,
awaiting
an
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
live
,
"
said
Deronda
 
<EOS>
"
_
<EOS>
some
time
_
<EOS>
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
both
silent
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
persuade
himself
to
say
more
unless
she
led
up
to
it
by
a
question
;
and
she
was
apparently
meditating
something
that
she
had
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
going
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
,
at
last
,
very
mildly
.
"
<EOS>
Can
I
understand
the
ideas
,
or
am
I
too
ignorant
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
to
the
East
to
become
better
acquainted
with
the
condition
of
my
race
in
various
countries
there
,
"
said
Deronda
,
gently
 
anxious
to
be
as
explanatory
as
he
could
on
what
was
the
impersonal
part
of
their
separateness
from
each
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
idea
that
I
am
possessed
with
is
that
of
restoring
a
political
existence
to
my
people
,
making
them
a
nation
again
,
giving
them
a
national
center
,
such
as
the
English
have
,
though
they
too
are
scattered
over
the
face
of
the
globe
.
<EOS>
That
is
a
task
which
presents
itself
to
me
as
a
duty
;
I
am
resolved
to
begin
it
,
however
feebly
.
<EOS>
I
am
resolved
to
devote
my
life
to
it
.
<EOS>
At
the
least
,
I
may
awaken
a
movement
in
other
minds
,
such
as
has
been
awakened
in
my
own
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
long
silence
between
them
.
<EOS>
The
world
seemed
getting
larger
round
poor
Gwendolen
,
and
she
more
solitary
and
helpless
in
the
midst
.
<EOS>
The
thought
that
he
might
come
back
after
going
to
the
East
,
sank
before
the
bewildering
vision
of
these
wild
-
stretching
purposes
in
which
she
felt
herself
reduced
to
a
mere
speck
.
<EOS>
There
comes
a
terrible
moment
to
many
souls
when
the
great
movements
of
the
world
,
the
larger
destinies
of
mankind
,
which
have
lain
aloof
in
newspapers
and
other
neglected
reading
,
enter
like
an
earthquake
into
their
own
lives
 
where
the
slow
urgency
of
growing
generations
turns
into
the
tread
of
an
invading
army
or
the
dire
clash
of
civil
war
,
and
gray
fathers
know
nothing
to
seek
for
but
the
corpses
of
their
blooming
sons
,
and
girls
forget
all
vanity
to
make
lint
and
bandages
which
may
serve
for
the
shattered
limbs
of
their
betrothed
husbands
.
<EOS>
Then
it
is
as
if
the
Invisible
Power
that
had
been
the
object
of
lip
-
worship
and
lip
-
resignation
became
visible
,
according
to
the
imagery
of
the
Hebrew
poet
,
making
the
flames
his
chariot
,
and
riding
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
,
till
the
mountains
smoke
and
the
plains
shudder
under
the
rolling
fiery
visitations
.
<EOS>
Often
the
good
cause
seems
to
lie
prostrate
under
the
thunder
of
relenting
force
,
the
martyrs
live
reviled
,
they
die
,
and
no
angel
is
seen
holding
forth
the
crown
and
the
palm
branch
.
<EOS>
Then
it
is
that
the
submission
of
the
soul
to
the
Highest
is
tested
,
and
even
in
the
eyes
of
frivolity
life
looks
out
from
the
scene
of
human
struggle
with
the
awful
face
of
duty
,
and
a
religion
shows
itself
which
is
something
else
than
a
private
consolation
.
  
<EOS>
That
was
the
sort
of
crisis
which
was
at
this
moment
beginning
in
Gwendolen
's
small
life
:
she
was
for
the
first
time
feeling
the
pressure
of
a
vast
mysterious
movement
,
for
the
first
time
being
dislodged
from
her
supremacy
in
her
own
world
,
and
getting
a
sense
that
her
horizon
was
but
a
dipping
onward
of
an
existence
with
which
her
own
was
revolving
.
<EOS>
All
the
troubles
of
her
wifehood
and
widowhood
had
still
left
her
with
the
implicit
impression
which
had
accompanied
her
from
childhood
,
that
whatever
surrounded
her
was
somehow
specially
for
her
,
and
it
was
because
of
this
that
no
personal
jealousy
had
been
roused
in
her
relation
to
Deronda
:
<EOS>
she
could
not
spontaneously
think
of
him
as
rightfully
belonging
to
others
more
than
to
her
.
<EOS>
But
here
had
come
a
shock
which
went
deeper
than
personal
jealousy
 
<EOS>
something
spiritual
and
vaguely
tremendous
that
thrust
her
away
,
and
yet
quelled
all
her
anger
into
self
-
humiliation
.
  
<EOS>
There
had
been
a
long
silence
.
<EOS>
Deronda
had
stood
still
,
even
thankful
for
an
interval
before
he
needed
to
say
more
,
and
Gwendolen
had
sat
like
a
statue
with
her
wrists
lying
over
each
other
and
her
eyes
fixed
 
<EOS>
the
intensity
of
her
mental
action
arresting
all
other
excitation
.
<EOS>
At
length
something
occurred
to
her
that
made
her
turn
her
face
to
Deronda
and
say
in
a
trembling
voice
    
"
<EOS>
Is
that
all
you
can
tell
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
question
was
like
a
dart
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
The
Jew
whom
I
mentioned
just
now
,
"
he
answered
,
not
without
a
certain
tremor
in
his
tones
too
,
"
the
remarkable
man
who
has
greatly
influenced
my
mind
,
has
not
perhaps
been
totally
unheard
of
by
you
.
<EOS>
He
is
the
brother
of
Miss
Lapidoth
,
whom
you
have
often
heard
sing
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
great
wave
of
remembrance
passed
through
Gwendolen
and
spread
as
a
deep
,
painful
flush
over
neck
and
face
.
<EOS>
It
had
come
first
at
the
scene
of
that
morning
when
she
had
called
on
Mirah
,
and
heard
Deronda
's
voice
reading
,
and
been
told
,
without
then
heeding
it
,
that
he
was
reading
Hebrew
with
Mirah
's
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
very
ill
 
very
near
death
now
,
"
Deronda
went
on
,
nervously
,
and
then
stopped
short
.
<EOS>
He
felt
that
he
must
wait
.
<EOS>
Would
she
divine
the
rest
?
  
<EOS>
"
Did
she
tell
you
that
I
went
to
her
?
"
said
Gwendolen
,
abruptly
,
looking
up
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Deronda
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
understand
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
turned
away
her
eyes
again
,
and
sat
thinking
.
<EOS>
Slowly
the
color
dried
out
of
face
and
neck
,
and
she
was
as
pale
as
before
 
with
that
almost
withered
paleness
which
is
seen
after
a
painful
flush
.
<EOS>
At
last
she
said
 
without
turning
toward
him
 
in
a
low
,
measured
voice
,
as
if
she
were
only
thinking
aloud
in
preparation
for
future
speech
    
<EOS>
"
But
_
can
_
you
marry
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Deronda
,
also
in
a
low
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
to
marry
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
first
there
was
no
change
in
Gwendolen
's
attitude
:
she
only
began
to
tremble
visibly
;
then
she
looked
before
her
with
dilated
eyes
,
as
at
something
lying
in
front
of
her
,
till
she
stretched
her
arms
out
straight
,
and
cried
with
a
smothered
voice
    
<EOS>
"
I
said
I
should
be
forsaken
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
a
cruel
woman
.
<EOS>
And
I
am
forsaken
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Deronda
's
anguish
was
intolerable
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
help
himself
.
<EOS>
He
seized
her
outstretched
hands
and
held
them
together
,
and
kneeled
at
her
feet
.
<EOS>
She
was
the
victim
of
his
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
cruel
,
too
,
I
am
cruel
,
"
he
repeated
,
with
a
sort
of
groan
,
looking
up
at
her
imploringly
.
  
<EOS>
His
presence
and
touch
seemed
to
dispel
a
horrible
vision
,
and
she
met
his
upward
look
of
sorrow
with
something
like
the
return
of
consciousness
after
fainting
.
<EOS>
Then
she
dwelt
on
it
with
that
growing
pathetic
movement
of
the
brow
which
accompanies
the
revival
of
some
tender
recollection
.
<EOS>
The
look
of
sorrow
brought
back
what
seemed
a
very
far
-
off
moment
 
<EOS>
the
first
time
she
had
ever
seen
it
,
in
the
library
at
the
Abbey
.
<EOS>
Sobs
rose
,
and
great
tears
fell
fast
.
<EOS>
Deronda
would
not
let
her
hands
go
 
held
them
still
with
one
of
his
,
and
himself
pressed
her
handkerchief
against
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
She
submitted
like
a
half
-
soothed
child
,
making
an
effort
to
speak
,
which
was
hindered
by
struggling
sobs
.
<EOS>
At
last
she
succeeded
in
saying
,
brokenly
    
<EOS>
"
I
said
 
I
said
 
it
should
be
better
 
better
with
me
 
for
having
known
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
eyes
too
were
larger
with
tears
.
<EOS>
She
wrested
one
of
her
hands
from
his
,
and
returned
his
action
,
pressing
his
tears
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
not
be
quite
parted
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
write
to
you
always
,
when
I
can
,
and
you
will
answer
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
waited
till
she
said
in
a
whisper
,
"
I
will
try
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
more
with
you
than
I
used
to
be
,
"
Deronda
said
with
gentle
urgency
,
releasing
her
hands
and
rising
from
his
kneeling
posture
.
<EOS>
"
If
we
had
been
much
together
before
,
we
should
have
felt
our
differences
more
,
and
seemed
to
get
farther
apart
.
<EOS>
Now
we
can
perhaps
never
see
each
other
again
.
<EOS>
But
our
minds
may
get
nearer
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gwendolen
said
nothing
,
but
rose
too
,
automatically
.
<EOS>
Her
withered
look
of
grief
,
such
as
the
sun
often
shines
on
when
the
blinds
are
drawn
up
after
the
burial
of
life
's
joy
,
made
him
hate
his
own
words
:
they
seemed
to
have
the
hardness
of
easy
consolation
in
them
.
<EOS>
She
felt
that
he
was
going
,
and
that
nothing
could
hinder
it
.
<EOS>
The
sense
of
it
was
like
a
dreadful
whisper
in
her
ear
,
which
dulled
all
other
consciousness
;
and
she
had
not
known
that
she
was
rising
.
  
<EOS>
Deronda
could
not
speak
again
.
<EOS>
He
thought
that
they
must
part
in
silence
,
but
it
was
difficult
to
move
toward
the
parting
,
till
she
looked
at
him
with
a
sort
of
intention
in
her
eyes
,
which
helped
him
.
<EOS>
He
advanced
to
put
out
his
hand
silently
,
and
when
she
had
placed
hers
within
it
,
she
said
what
her
mind
had
been
laboring
with
    
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
very
good
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
deserved
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
will
try
 
try
to
live
.
<EOS>
I
shall
think
of
you
.
<EOS>
What
good
have
I
been
?
<EOS>
Only
harm
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
me
be
harm
to
_
<EOS>
you
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
It
shall
be
the
better
for
me
 
<EOS>
"
  
She
could
not
finish
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
that
she
was
sobbing
,
but
that
the
intense
effort
with
which
she
spoke
made
her
too
tremulous
.
<EOS>
The
burden
of
that
difficult
rectitude
toward
him
was
a
weight
her
frame
tottered
under
.
  
<EOS>
She
bent
forward
to
kiss
his
cheek
,
and
he
kissed
hers
.
<EOS>
Then
they
looked
at
each
other
for
an
instant
with
clasped
hands
,
and
he
turned
away
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
was
quite
gone
,
her
mother
came
in
and
found
her
sitting
motionless
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gwendolen
,
dearest
,
you
look
very
ill
,
"
she
said
,
bending
over
her
and
touching
her
cold
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
mamma
.
<EOS>
But
do
n't
be
afraid
.
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
live
,
"
said
Gwendolen
,
bursting
out
hysterically
.
  
<EOS>
Her
mother
persuaded
her
to
go
to
bed
,
and
watched
by
her
.
<EOS>
Through
the
day
and
half
the
night
she
fell
continually
into
fits
of
shrieking
,
but
cried
in
the
midst
of
them
to
her
mother
,
"
Do
n't
be
afraid
.
<EOS>
I
shall
live
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
live
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
After
all
,
she
slept
;
and
when
she
waked
in
the
morning
light
,
she
looked
up
fixedly
at
her
mother
and
said
tenderly
,
"
Ah
,
poor
mamma
!
<EOS>
You
have
been
sitting
up
with
me
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
unhappy
.
<EOS>
I
shall
live
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
better
.
"
        
<EOS>
In
the
checkered
area
of
human
experience
the
seasons
are
all
mingled
    
as
in
the
golden
age
:
<EOS>
fruit
and
blossom
hang
together
;
in
the
same
    
moment
the
sickle
is
reaping
and
the
seed
is
sprinkled
;
one
tends
the
    
green
cluster
and
another
treads
the
winepress
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
in
each
of
our
    
lives
harvest
and
spring
-
time
are
continually
one
,
until
himself
    
gathers
us
and
sows
us
anew
in
his
invisible
fields
.
   
<EOS>
Among
the
blessings
of
love
there
is
hardly
one
more
exquisite
than
the
sense
that
in
uniting
the
beloved
life
to
ours
we
can
watch
over
its
happiness
,
bring
comfort
where
hardship
was
,
and
over
memories
of
privation
and
suffering
open
the
sweetest
fountains
of
joy
.
<EOS>
Deronda
's
love
for
Mirah
was
strongly
imbued
with
that
blessed
protectiveness
.
<EOS>
Even
with
infantine
feet
she
had
begun
to
tread
among
thorns
;
and
the
first
time
he
had
beheld
her
face
it
had
seemed
to
him
the
girlish
image
of
despair
.
  
<EOS>
But
now
she
was
glowing
like
a
dark
-
tipped
yet
delicate
ivory
-
tinted
flower
in
the
warm
sunlight
of
content
,
thinking
of
any
possible
grief
as
part
of
that
life
with
Deronda
,
which
she
could
call
by
no
other
name
than
good
.
<EOS>
And
he
watched
the
sober
gladness
which
gave
new
beauty
to
her
movements
;
and
her
habitual
attitudes
of
repose
,
with
a
delight
which
made
him
say
to
himself
that
it
was
enough
of
personal
joy
for
him
to
save
her
from
pain
.
<EOS>
She
knew
nothing
of
Hans
's
struggle
or
of
Gwendolen
's
pang
;
for
after
the
assurance
that
Deronda
's
hidden
love
had
been
for
her
,
she
easily
explained
Gwendolen
's
eager
solicitude
about
him
as
part
of
a
grateful
dependence
on
his
goodness
,
such
as
she
herself
had
known
.
<EOS>
And
all
Deronda
's
words
about
Mrs.
Grandcourt
confirmed
that
view
of
their
relation
,
though
he
never
touched
on
it
except
in
the
most
distant
manner
.
<EOS>
Mirah
was
ready
to
believe
that
he
had
been
a
rescuing
angel
to
many
besides
herself
.
<EOS>
The
only
wonder
was
,
that
she
among
them
all
was
to
have
the
bliss
of
being
continually
by
his
side
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
when
the
bridal
veil
was
around
Mirah
it
hid
no
doubtful
tremors
 
<EOS>
only
a
thrill
of
awe
at
the
acceptance
of
a
great
gift
which
required
great
uses
.
<EOS>
And
the
velvet
canopy
never
covered
a
more
goodly
bride
and
bridegroom
,
to
whom
their
people
might
more
wisely
wish
offspring
;
more
truthful
lips
never
touched
the
sacrament
marriage
-
wine
;
the
marriage
-
blessing
never
gathered
stronger
promise
of
fulfillment
than
in
the
integrity
of
their
mutual
pledge
.
<EOS>
Naturally
,
they
were
married
according
to
the
Jewish
rite
.
<EOS>
And
since
no
religion
seems
yet
to
have
demanded
that
when
we
make
a
feast
we
should
invite
only
the
highest
rank
of
our
acquaintances
,
few
,
it
is
to
be
hoped
,
will
be
offended
to
learn
that
among
the
guests
at
Deronda
's
little
wedding
-
feast
<EOS>
was
the
entire
Cohen
family
,
with
the
one
exception
of
the
baby
who
carried
on
her
teething
intelligently
at
home
.
<EOS>
How
could
Mordecai
have
borne
that
those
friends
of
his
adversity
should
have
been
shut
out
from
rejoicing
in
common
with
him
?
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Meyrick
so
fully
understood
this
that
she
had
quite
reconciled
herself
to
meeting
the
Jewish
pawnbroker
,
and
was
there
with
her
three
daughters
 
all
of
them
enjoying
the
consciousness
that
Mirah
's
marriage
to
Deronda
crowned
a
romance
which
would
always
make
a
sweet
memory
to
them
.
<EOS>
For
which
of
them
,
mother
or
girls
,
had
not
had
a
generous
part
in
it
 
giving
their
best
in
feeling
and
in
act
to
her
who
needed
?
<EOS>
If
Hans
could
have
been
there
,
it
would
have
been
better
;
but
Mab
had
already
observed
that
men
must
suffer
for
being
so
inconvenient
;
suppose
she
,
Kate
,
and
Amy
had
all
fallen
in
love
with
Mr.
Deronda
?
 
<EOS>
but
being
women
they
were
not
so
ridiculous
.
  
<EOS>
The
Meyricks
were
rewarded
for
conquering
their
prejudices
by
hearing
a
speech
from
Mr.
Cohen
,
which
had
the
rare
quality
among
speeches
of
not
being
quite
after
the
usual
pattern
.
<EOS>
Jacob
ate
beyond
his
years
,
and
contributed
several
small
whinnying
laughs
as
a
free
accompaniment
of
his
father
's
speech
,
not
irreverently
,
but
from
a
lively
sense
that
his
family
was
distinguishing
itself
;
while
Adelaide
Rebekah
,
in
a
new
Sabbath
frock
,
maintained
throughout
a
grave
air
of
responsibility
.
  
<EOS>
Mordecai
's
brilliant
eyes
,
sunken
in
their
large
sockets
,
dwelt
on
the
scene
with
the
cherishing
benignancy
of
a
spirit
already
lifted
into
an
aloofness
which
nullified
only
selfish
requirements
and
left
sympathy
alive
.
<EOS>
But
continually
,
after
his
gaze
had
been
traveling
round
on
the
others
,
it
returned
to
dwell
on
Deronda
with
a
fresh
gleam
of
trusting
affection
.
  
<EOS>
The
wedding
-
feast
was
humble
,
but
Mirah
was
not
without
splendid
wedding
-
gifts
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
betrothal
had
been
known
,
there
were
friends
who
had
entertained
graceful
devices
.
<EOS>
Sir
Hugo
and
Lady
Mallinger
had
taken
trouble
to
provide
a
complete
equipment
for
Eastern
travel
,
as
well
as
a
precious
locket
containing
an
inscription
 
<EOS>
"
_
<EOS>
To
the
bride
of
our
dear
Daniel
Deronda
all
blessings
.
<EOS>
H.
and
L.
M.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
"
The
Klesmers
sent
a
perfect
watch
,
also
with
a
pretty
inscription
.
  
<EOS>
But
something
more
precious
than
gold
and
gems
came
to
Deronda
from
the
neighborhood
of
Diplow
on
the
morning
of
his
marriage
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
letter
containing
these
words
:
        
Do
not
think
of
me
sorrowfully
on
your
wedding
-
day
.
<EOS>
I
have
remembered
    
your
words
 
that
I
may
live
to
be
one
of
the
best
of
women
,
who
    
make
others
glad
that
they
were
born
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
yet
see
how
that
can
    
be
,
but
you
know
better
than
I.
<EOS>
If
it
ever
comes
true
,
it
will
be
    
because
you
helped
me
.
<EOS>
I
only
thought
of
myself
,
and
I
made
you
    
grieve
.
<EOS>
It
hurts
me
now
to
think
of
your
grief
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
grieve
    
any
more
for
me
.
<EOS>
It
is
better
 
<EOS>
it
shall
be
better
with
me
because
I
    
have
known
you
.
      
<EOS>
GWENDOLEN
GRANDCOURT
.
  
<EOS>
The
preparations
for
the
departure
of
all
three
to
the
East
began
at
once
;
for
Deronda
could
not
deny
Ezra
's
wish
that
they
should
set
out
on
the
voyage
forthwith
,
so
that
he
might
go
with
them
,
instead
of
detaining
them
to
watch
over
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
belief
that
Ezra
's
life
would
last
through
the
voyage
,
<EOS>
for
there
were
symptoms
which
seemed
to
show
that
the
last
stage
of
his
malady
had
set
in
.
<EOS>
But
Ezra
himself
had
said
,
"
Never
mind
where
I
die
,
so
that
I
am
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
did
not
set
out
with
them
.
<EOS>
One
morning
early
he
said
to
Deronda
,
"
Do
not
quit
me
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
I
shall
die
before
it
is
ended
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
chose
to
be
dressed
and
sit
up
in
his
easy
chair
as
usual
,
Deronda
and
Mirah
on
each
side
of
him
,
and
for
some
hours
he
was
unusually
silent
,
not
even
making
the
effort
to
speak
,
but
looking
at
them
occasionally
with
eyes
full
of
some
restful
meaning
,
as
if
to
assure
them
that
while
this
remnant
of
breathing
-
time
was
difficult
,
he
felt
an
ocean
of
peace
beneath
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
till
late
in
the
afternoon
,
when
the
light
was
falling
,
that
he
took
a
hand
of
each
in
his
and
said
,
looking
at
Deronda
,
"
Death
is
coming
to
me
as
the
divine
kiss
which
is
both
parting
and
reunion
 
which
takes
me
from
your
bodily
eyes
and
gives
me
full
presence
in
your
soul
.
<EOS>
Where
thou
goest
,
Daniel
,
I
shall
go
.
<EOS>
Is
it
not
begun
?
<EOS>
Have
I
not
breathed
my
soul
into
you
?
<EOS>
We
shall
live
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
paused
,
and
Deronda
waited
,
thinking
that
there
might
be
another
word
for
him
.
<EOS>
But
slowly
and
with
effort
Ezra
,
pressing
on
their
hands
,
raised
himself
and
uttered
in
Hebrew
the
confession
of
the
divine
Unity
,
which
long
for
generations
has
been
on
the
lips
of
the
dying
Israelite
.
  
<EOS>
He
sank
back
gently
into
his
chair
,
and
did
not
speak
again
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
some
hours
before
he
had
ceased
to
breathe
,
with
Mirah
's
and
Deronda
's
arms
around
him
.
    
<EOS>
"
Nothing
is
here
for
tears
,
nothing
to
wail
  
Or
knock
the
breast
;
no
weakness
,
no
contempt
,
  
Dispraise
or
blame
;
nothing
but
well
and
fair
,
  
And
what
may
quiet
us
in
a
death
so
noble
.
