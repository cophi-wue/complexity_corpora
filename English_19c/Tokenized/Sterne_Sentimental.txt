They
order

said
I
,
this
matter
better
in
France
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
been
in
France
?
<EOS>
said
my
gentleman
,
turning
quick
upon
me
,
with
the
most
civil
triumph
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
Strange
!
<EOS>
quoth
<EOS>
I
,
debating
the
matter
with
myself
,
That
one
and
twenty
miles
sailing
,
for
'
tis
absolutely
no
further
from
Dover
to
Calais
,
should
give
a
man
these
rights
:
   
<EOS>
I
'll
look
into
them
:
 
so
,
giving
up
the
argument
,
 
<EOS>
I
went
straight
to
my
lodgings
,
put
up
half
a
dozen
shirts
and
a
black
pair
of
silk
breeches
,
 
"
the
coat
I
have
on
,
"
said
I
,
looking
at
the
sleeve
,
"
will
do
;
"
 
took
a
place
in
the
Dover
stage
;
and
the
packet
sailing
at
nine
the
next
morning
,
 
by
three
I
had
got
sat
down
to
my
dinner
upon
a
fricaseed
chicken
,
so
incontestably
in
France
,
<EOS>
that
had
I
died
that
night
of
an
indigestion
,
the
whole
world
could
not
have
suspended
the
effects
of
the
droits
d'aubaine
;
 
my
shirts
,
and
black
pair
of
silk
breeches
,
 
portmanteau
and
all
,
must
have
gone
to
the
King
of
France
;
 
even
the
little
picture
which
I
have
so
long
worn
,
and
so
often
have
told
thee
,
Eliza
,
I
would
carry
with
me
into
my
grave
,
would
have
been
torn
from
my
neck
!
 
<EOS>
Ungenerous
!
<EOS>
to
seize
upon
the
wreck
of
an
unwary
passenger
,
whom
your
subjects
had
beckoned
to
their
coast
!
 
<EOS>
By
heaven
!
 
<EOS>
Sire
,
it
is
not
well
done
;
and
much
does
it
grieve
me
,
'
tis
the
monarch
of
a
people
so
civilized
and
courteous
,
and
so
renowned
for
sentiment
and
fine
feelings
,
that
I
have
to
reason
with
!
     
<EOS>
But
I
have
scarce
set
a
foot
in
your
dominions
.
     
<EOS>
CALAIS
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
had
fished
my
dinner
,
and
drank
the
King
of
France
's
health
,
to
satisfy
my
mind
that
I
bore
him
no
spleen
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
high
honour
for
the
humanity
of
his
temper
,
 
I
rose
up
an
inch
taller
for
the
accommodation
.
     
<EOS>
No
 
said
I
 
<EOS>
the
Bourbon
is
by
no
means
a
cruel
race
:
 
<EOS>
they
may
be
misled
,
like
other
people
;
but
there
is
a
mildness
in
their
blood
.
<EOS>
As
I
acknowledged
this
,
I
felt
a
suffusion
of
a
finer
kind
upon
my
cheek
 
more
warm
and
friendly
to
man
,
than
what
Burgundy
(
at
least
of
two
livres
a
bottle
,
which
was
such
as
I
had
been
drinking
)
could
have
produced
.
     
<EOS>
Just
God
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
kicking
my
portmanteau
aside
,
what
is
there
in
this
world
's
goods
which
should
sharpen
our
spirits
,
and
make
so
many
kind
-
hearted
brethren
of
us
fall
out
so
cruelly
as
we
do
by
the
way
?
  
<EOS>
When
man
is
at
peace
with
man
,
how
much
lighter
than
a
feather
is
the
heaviest
of
metals
in
his
hand
!
<EOS>
he
pulls
out
his
purse
,
and
holding
it
airily
and
uncompressed
,
looks
round
him
,
as
if
he
sought
for
an
object
to
share
it
with
.
 
<EOS>
In
doing
this
,
I
felt
every
vessel
in
my
frame
dilate
,
 
the
arteries
beat
all
cheerily
together
,
and
every
power
which
sustained
life
,
performed
it
with
so
little
friction
,
that
'
twould
have
confounded
the
most
physical
precieuse
in
France
;
with
all
her
materialism
,
she
could
scarce
have
called
me
a
machine
.
     
<EOS>
I
'm
confident
,
said
I
to
myself
,
I
should
have
overset
her
creed
.
  
<EOS>
The
accession
of
that
idea
carried
nature
,
at
that
time
,
as
high
as
she
could
go
;
 
I
was
at
peace
with
the
world
before
,
and
this
finish'd
<EOS>
the
treaty
with
myself
.
        
<EOS>
Now
,
was
I
King
of
France
,
cried
I
 
<EOS>
what
a
moment
for
an
orphan
to
have
begg'd
his
father
's
portmanteau
of
me
!
  
<EOS>
THE
MONK
.
 
<EOS>
CALAIS
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
scarce
uttered
the
words
,
when
a
poor
monk
of
the
order
of
St.
Francis
came
into
the
room
to
beg
something
for
a
his
convent
.
<EOS>
No
man
cares
to
have
his
virtues
<EOS>
the
sport
of
contingencies
 
or
one
man
may
be
generous
,
as
another
is
puissant
;
 
sed
non
quoad
hanc
 
or
be
it
as
it
may
,
 
for
there
is
no
regular
reasoning
upon
the
ebbs
and
flows
of
our
humours
;
they
may
depend
upon
the
same
causes
,
for
aught
I
know
,
which
influence
the
tides
themselves
:
'
twould
oft
be
no
discredit
to
us
,
to
suppose
it
was
so
:
 
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
at
least
for
myself
,
that
in
many
a
case
I
should
be
more
highly
satisfied
,
to
have
it
said
by
the
world
,
"
I
had
had
an
affair
with
the
moon
,
in
which
there
was
neither
sin
nor
shame
,
"
than
have
it
pass
altogether
as
my
own
act
and
deed
,
wherein
there
was
so
much
of
both
.
     
<EOS>
But
,
be
this
as
it
may
,
 
the
moment
I
cast
my
eyes
upon
him
,
I
was
predetermined
not
to
give
him
a
single
sous
;
and
,
accordingly
,
I
put
my
purse
into
my
pocket
 
<EOS>
buttoned
it
 
<EOS>
set
myself
a
little
more
upon
my
centre
,
and
advanced
up
gravely
to
him
;
there
was
something
,
I
fear
,
forbidding
in
my
look
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
his
figure
this
moment
before
my
eyes
,
and
think
there
was
that
in
it
which
deserved
better
.
  
<EOS>
The
monk
,
as
I
judged
by
the
break
in
his
tonsure
,
a
few
scattered
white
hairs
upon
his
temples
,
being
all
that
remained
of
it
,
might
be
about
seventy
;
 
but
from
his
eyes
,
and
that
sort
of
fire
which
was
in
them
,
which
seemed
more
temper'd
by
courtesy
than
years
,
could
be
no
more
than
sixty
:
  
<EOS>
T
ruth
might
lie
between
 
<EOS>
He
was
certainly
sixty
-
five
;
and
the
general
air
of
his
countenance
,
notwithstanding
something
seem'd
to
have
been
planting
-
wrinkles
in
it
before
their
time
,
agreed
to
the
account
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
one
of
those
heads
which
Guido
has
often
painted
,
 
mild
,
pale
 
penetrating
,
free
from
all
commonplace
ideas
of
fat
contented
ignorance
looking
downwards
upon
the
earth
;
 
it
<EOS>
look'd
forwards
;
but
look'd
as
if
it
look'd
<EOS>
at
something
beyond
this
world
.
 
<EOS>
How
one
of
his
order
came
by
it
,
heaven
above
,
who
let
it
fall
upon
a
monk
's
shoulders
best
knows
:
 
but
it
would
have
suited
a
Bramin
,
and
had
I
met
it
upon
the
plains
of
Indostan
<EOS>
,
I
had
reverenced
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
rest
of
his
outline
may
be
given
in
a
few
strokes
;
one
might
put
it
into
the
hands
of
any
one
to
design
,
for
'
twas
neither
elegant
nor
otherwise
,
but
as
character
and
expression
made
it
so
<EOS>
:
it
was
a
thin
,
spare
form
,
something
above
the
common
size
,
if
it
lost
not
the
distinction
by
a
bend
forward
in
the
figure
,
 
but
it
was
the
attitude
of
Intreaty
;
and
,
<EOS>
as
it
now
stands
presented
to
my
imagination
,
it
gained
more
than
it
lost
by
it
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
had
entered
the
room
three
paces
,
he
stood
still
;
and
laying
his
left
hand
upon
his
breast
(
a
slender
white
staff
with
which
he
journey'd
being
in
his
right
)
 
<EOS>
when
I
had
got
close
up
to
him
,
he
introduced
himself
with
the
little
story
of
the
wants
of
his
convent
,
and
the
poverty
of
his
order
;
 
and
did
it
with
so
simple
a
grace
,
 
and
such
an
air
of
deprecation
was
there
in
the
whole
cast
of
his
look
and
figure
,
 
<EOS>
I
was
bewitch'd
not
to
have
been
struck
with
it
.
     
<EOS>
A
better
reason
was
,
I
had
predetermined
not
to
give
him
a
single
sous
.
  
<EOS>
THE
MONK
.
 
<EOS>
CALAIS
.
     
<EOS>
'
Tis
very
true
<EOS>
,
said
I
,
replying
to
a
cast
upwards
with
his
eyes
,
with
which
he
had
concluded
his
address
;
 
'
tis
very
true
,
 
and
heaven
be
their
resource
who
have
no
other
<EOS>
but
the
charity
of
the
world
,
the
stock
of
which
,
I
fear
,
is
no
way
sufficient
for
the
many
GREAT
CLAIMS
which
are
hourly
made
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
As
I
pronounced
the
words
GREAT
CLAIMS
,
he
gave
a
slight
glance
with
his
eye
downwards
upon
the
sleeve
of
his
tunic
:
  
<EOS>
I
 
felt
the
full
force
of
the
appeal
 
<EOS>
I
acknowledge
it
,
said
I
:
  
<EOS>
a
 
coarse
habit
,
and
that
but
once
in
three
years
with
meagre
diet
,
 
are
no
great
matters
;
and
the
true
point
of
pity
is
,
as
they
can
be
earn'd
in
the
world
with
so
little
industry
,
that
your
order
should
wish
to
procure
them
by
pressing
upon
a
fund
which
is
the
property
of
the
lame
,
the
blind
,
the
aged
and
the
infirm
;
 
the
captive
who
lies
down
counting
over
and
over
again
the
days
of
his
afflictions
,
languishes
also
for
his
share
of
it
;
and
had
you
been
of
the
ORDER
OF
MERCY
,
instead
of
the
order
of
St.
Francis
,
poor
as
I
am
,
<EOS>
continued
I
,
pointing
at
my
portmanteau
,
full
cheerfully
should
it
have
been
open'd
to
you
,
for
the
ransom
of
the
unfortunate
.
 
<EOS>
The
monk
made
me
a
bow
.
 
<EOS>
But
of
all
others
,
resumed
I
,
the
unfortunate
of
our
own
country
,
surely
,
have
the
first
rights
;
and
I
have
left
thousands
in
distress
upon
our
own
shore
.
 
<EOS>
The
monk
gave
a
cordial
wave
with
his
head
,
 
as
much
as
to
say
,
No
doubt
there
is
misery
enough
in
every
corner
of
the
world
,
as
well
as
within
our
convent
 
<EOS>
But
we
distinguish
,
said
I
,
laying
my
hand
upon
the
sleeve
of
his
tunic
,
in
return
for
his
appeal
 
<EOS>
we
distinguish
,
my
good
father
!
<EOS>
betwixt
those
who
wish
only
to
eat
the
bread
of
their
own
labour
 
and
those
who
eat
the
bread
of
other
people
's
,
and
have
no
other
plan
in
life
,
but
to
get
through
it
in
sloth
and
ignorance
,
FOR
THE
LOVE
OF
GOD
.
  
<EOS>
The
poor
Franciscan
made
no
reply
:
 
a
hectic
of
a
moment
pass'd
across
his
cheek
,
but
could
not
tarry
 
<EOS>
Nature
seemed
to
have
done
with
her
resentments
in
him
;
 
he
showed
none
:
  
<EOS>
b
ut
letting
his
staff
fall
within
his
arms
,
he
pressed
both
his
hands
with
resignation
upon
his
breast
,
and
retired
.
  
<EOS>
THE
MONK

<EOS>

<EOS>
My
heart
smote
me
the
moment
he
shut
the
door
 
Psha
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
with
an
air
of
carelessness
,
three
several
times
 
<EOS>
but
it
would
not
do
:
<EOS>
every
ungracious
syllable
I
had
utter'd
crowded
back
into
my
imagination
:
 
<EOS>
I
reflected
,
I
had
no
right
over
the
poor
Franciscan
,
but
to
deny
him
;
and
that
the
punishment
of
that
was
enough
to
the
disappointed
,
without
the
addition
of
unkind
language
.
 
<EOS>
I
consider'd
<EOS>
his
gray
hairs
 
his
courteous
figure
seem'd
<EOS>
to
re
-
enter
and
gently
ask
me
what
injury
he
had
done
me
?
 
<EOS>
and
why
I
could
use
him
thus
?
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
given
twenty
livres
for
an
advocate
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
behaved
very
ill
,
said
I
within
myself
;
but
I
have
only
just
set
out
upon
my
travels
;
and
shall
learn
better
manners
as
I
get
along

<EOS>
When
a
man
is
discontented
with
himself
,
it
has
one
advantage
however
,
that
it
puts
him
into
an
excellent
frame
of
mind
for
making
a
bargain

<EOS>
Now
there
being
no
travelling
through
France
and
Italy
without
a
chaise
,
 
and
nature
generally
prompting
us
to
the
thing
we
are
fittest
for
,
<EOS>
I
walk'd
out
into
the
coach
-
yard
to
buy
or
hire
something
of
that
kind
to
my
purpose
:
 
an
old
desobligeant
in
the
furthest
corner
of
the
court
,
hit
my
fancy
at
first
sight
,
so
I
instantly
got
into
it
,
and
finding
it
in
tolerable
harmony
with
my
feelings
,
I
ordered
the
waiter
to
call
Monsieur
Dessein
,
the
master
of
the
hotel
:
  
b
ut
Monsieur
Dessein
being
gone
to
vespers
,
and
not
caring
to
face
the
Franciscan
,
whom
I
saw
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
court
,
in
conference
with
a
lady
just
arrived
at
the
inn
,
 
<EOS>
I
drew
the
taffeta
curtain
<EOS>
betwixt
us
,
and
being
determined
to
write
my
journey
<EOS>
,
I
took
out
my
pen
and
ink
and
wrote
the
preface
to
it
in
the
desobligeant
.
  
<EOS>
PREFACE
.
 
<EOS>
IN
THE
DESOBLIGEANT
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
have
been
observed
by
many
a
peripatetic
philosopher
,
That
nature
has
set
up
by
her
own
unquestionable
authority
certain
boundaries
and
fences
to
circumscribe
the
discontent
of
man
;
she
has
effected
her
purpose
in
the
quietest
and
easiest
manner
by
laying
him
under
almost
insuperable
obligations
to
work
out
his
ease
,
and
to
sustain
his
sufferings
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
there
only
that
she
has
provided
him
with
the
most
suitable
objects
to
partake
of
his
happiness
,
and
bear
a
part
of
that
burden
which
in
all
countries
and
ages
has
ever
been
too
heavy
for
one
pair
of
shoulders
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
true
,
we
are
endued
with
an
imperfect
power
of
spreading
our
happiness
sometimes
beyond
HER
limits
,
but
'
tis
so
ordered
,
that
,
from
the
want
of
languages
,
connections
,
and
dependencies
,
and
from
the
difference
in
education
,
customs
,
and
habits
,
we
lie
under
so
many
impediments
in
communicating
our
sensations
out
of
our
own
sphere
,
as
often
amount
to
a
total
impossibility
.
  
<EOS>
It
will
always
follow
from
hence
,
that
the
balance
of
sentimental
commerce
is
always
against
the
expatriated
adventurer
:
 
<EOS>
he
must
buy
what
he
has
little
occasion
for
,
at
their
own
price
;
 
his
conversation
will
seldom
be
taken
in
exchange
for
theirs
without
a
large
discount
,
 
and
this
,
by
the
by
,
eternally
driving
him
into
the
hands
of
more
equitable
brokers
,
for
such
conversation
as
he
can
find
,
it
requires
no
great
spirit
of
divination
to
guess
at
his
party
     
<EOS>
This
brings
me
to
my
point
;
and
naturally
leads
me
(
if
the
see
-
saw
of
this
desobligeant
will
but
let
me
get
on
)
into
the
efficient
as
well
as
final
causes
of
travelling
     
<EOS>
Your
idle
people
that
leave
their
native
country
,
and
go
abroad
for
some
reason
or
reasons
which
may
be
derived
from
one
of
these
general
causes
:
    
Infirmity
of
body
,
Imbecility
of
mind
,
or
Inevitable
necessity
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
two
include
all
those
who
travel
by
land
or
by
water
,
labouring
with
pride
,
curiosity
,
vanity
,
or
spleen
,
subdivided
and
combined
ad
infinitum
.
  
<EOS>
The
third
class
includes
the
whole
army
of
peregrine
martyrs
;
more
especially
those
travellers
who
set
out
upon
their
travels
with
the
benefit
of
the
clergy
,
either
as
delinquents
travelling
under
the
direction
of
governors
recommended
by
the
magistrate
;
 
or
young
gentlemen
transported
by
the
cruelty
of
parents
and
guardians
,
and
travelling
under
the
direction
of
governors
recommended
by
Oxford
,
Aberdeen
,
and
Glasgow
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
a
fourth
class
,
but
their
number
is
so
small
that
they
would
not
deserve
a
distinction
,
were
it
not
necessary
in
a
work
of
this
nature
to
observe
the
greatest
precision
and
nicety
,
to
avoid
a
confusion
of
character
.
 
<EOS>
And
these
men
I
speak
of
,
are
such
as
cross
the
seas
and
sojourn
in
a
land
of
strangers
,
with
a
view
of
saving
money
for
various
reasons
and
upon
various
pretences
:
 
<EOS>
but
as
they
might
also
save
themselves
and
others
a
great
deal
of
unnecessary
trouble
by
saving
their
money
at
home
,
 
and
as
their
reasons
for
travelling
are
the
least
complex
of
any
other
species
of
emigrants
,
I
shall
distinguish
these
gentlemen
by
the
name
of
  
Simple
Travellers
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
the
whole
circle
of
travellers
may
be
reduced
to
the
following
HEADS
:
    
Idle
Travellers
,
Inquisitive
Travellers
,
Lying
Travellers
,
Proud
Travellers
,
Vain
Travellers
,
Splenetic
Travellers
.
  
<EOS>
Then
follow
:
  
The
Travellers
of
Necessity
,
The
Delinquent
and
Felonious
Traveller
,
The
Unfortunate
and
Innocent
Traveller
,
The
Simple
Traveller
,
  
And
last
of
all
(
if
you
please
)
<EOS>
The
Sentimental
Traveller
,
(
meaning
thereby
myself
)
who
have
travell'd
,
and
of
which
I
am
now
sitting
down
to
give
an
account
,
 
as
much
out
of
NECESSITY
,
and
the
besoin
de
Voyager
,
as
any
one
in
the
class
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
well
aware
,
at
the
same
time
,
as
both
my
travels
and
observations
will
be
altogether
of
a
different
cast
from
any
of
my
forerunners
,
that
I
might
have
insisted
upon
a
whole
nitch
entirely
to
myself
;
 
but
I
should
break
in
upon
the
confines
of
the
VAIN
Traveller
,
in
wishing
to
draw
attention
towards
me
,
till
I
have
some
better
grounds
for
it
than
the
mere
NOVELTY
OF
MY
VEHICLE
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
sufficient
for
my
reader
,
if
he
has
been
a
traveller
himself
,
that
with
study
and
reflection
hereupon
he
may
be
able
to
determine
his
own
place
and
rank
in
the
catalogue
;
 
it
will
be
one
step
towards
knowing
himself
;
as
it
is
great
odds
<EOS>
but
he
retains
some
tincture
and
resemblance
,
of
what
he
imbibed
or
carried
out
,
to
the
present
hour
.
  
<EOS>
The
man
who
first
transplanted
the
grape
of
Burgundy
to
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope
(
observe
he
was
a
Dutchman
)
never
dreamt
of
drinking
the
same
wine
at
the
Cape
,
that
the
same
grape
produced
upon
the
French
mountains
,
 
he
was
too
phlegmatic
for
that
 
<EOS>
but
undoubtedly
he
expected
to
drink
some
sort
of
vinous
liquor
;
but
whether
good
or
bad
,
or
indifferent
,
 
he
knew
enough
of
this
world
to
know
,
that
it
did
not
depend
upon
his
choice
,
but
that
what
is
generally
called
CHOICE
,
was
to
decide
his
success
:
 
<EOS>
however
,
he
hoped
for
the
best
;
and
in
these
hopes
,
by
an
intemperate
confidence
in
the
fortitude
of
his
head
,
and
the
depth
of
his
discretion
,
Mynheer
might
possibly
oversee
both
in
his
new
vineyard
;
and
by
discovering
his
nakedness
,
become
a
laughing
stock
to
his
people
.
  
<EOS>
Even
so
it
fares
with
the
Poor
Traveller
,
sailing
and
posting
through
the
politer
kingdoms
of
the
globe
,
in
pursuit
of
knowledge
and
improvements
.
  
<EOS>
Knowledge
and
improvements
are
to
be
got
by
sailing
and
posting
for
that
purpose
;
but
whether
useful
knowledge
and
real
improvements
is
all
a
lottery
;
 
and
even
where
the
adventurer
is
successful
,
the
acquired
stock
must
be
used
with
caution
and
sobriety
,
to
turn
to
any
profit
:
  
b
ut
,
as
the
chances
run
prodigiously
the
other
way
,
both
as
to
the
acquisition
and
application
,
I
am
of
opinion
,
That
a
man
would
act
as
wisely
,
if
he
could
prevail
upon
himself
to
live
contented
without
foreign
knowledge
or
foreign
improvements
,
especially
if
he
lives
in
a
country
that
has
no
absolute
want
of
either
;
 
and
indeed
,
much
grief
of
heart
has
it
oft
and
many
a
time
cost
me
,
when
I
have
observed
how
many
a
foul
step
<EOS>
the
Inquisitive
Traveller
has
measured
to
see
sights
and
look
into
discoveries
;
all
which
,
as
Sancho
Panza
said
to
Don
Quixote
,
they
might
have
seen
dry
-
shod
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
an
age
so
full
of
light
,
that
there
is
scarce
a
country
or
corner
in
Europe
whose
beams
are
not
crossed
and
interchanged
with
others
.
 
<EOS>
Knowledge
in
most
of
its
branches
,
and
in
most
affairs
,
is
like
music
in
an
Italian
street
,
whereof
those
may
partake
who
pay
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
is
no
nation
under
heaven
 
and
<EOS>
God
is
my
record
(
before
whose
tribunal
I
must
one
day
come
and
give
an
account
of
this
work
)
 
<EOS>
that
I
do
not
speak
it
vauntingly
,
 
<EOS>
but
there
is
no
nation
under
heaven
abounding
with
more
variety
of
learning
,
 
where
the
sciences
may
be
more
fitly
woo'd
,
or
more
surely
won
,
than
here
,
 
where
art
is
encouraged
,
and
will
so
soon
rise
high
,
 
where
Nature
(
take
her
altogether
)
<EOS>
has
so
little
to
answer
for
,
 
and
,
to
close
all
,
where
there
is
more
wit
and
variety
of
character
to
feed
the
mind
with
:
  
W
here
then
,
my
dear
countrymen
,
are
you
going
?
     
<EOS>
We
are
only
looking
at
this
chaise
,
said
they
.
 
<EOS>
Your
most
obedient
servant
,
said
I
,
skipping
out
of
it
,
and
pulling
off
my
hat
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
wondering
,
said
one
of
them
,
who
,
I
found
was
an
Inquisitive
Traveller
,
 
what
could
occasion
its
motion
.
 
<EOS>
'
Twas
the
agitation
,
said
I
,
coolly
,
of
writing
a
preface
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
heard
,
said
the
other
,
who
was
a
Simple
Traveller
,
of
a
preface
wrote
in
a
desobligeant
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
better
,
said
I
,
in
a
vis
-
a
-
vis
.
     
<EOS>
As
an
Englishman
does
not
travel
to
see
Englishmen
,
I
retired
to
my
room
.
  
<EOS>
CALAIS
.
  
<EOS>
I
perceived
that
something
darken'd
<EOS>
the
passage
more
than
myself
,
as
I
stepp'd
along
it
to
my
room
;
it
was
effectually
Mons
.
<EOS>
Dessein
,
the
master
of
the
hotel
,
who
had
just
returned
from
vespers
,
and
with
his
hat
under
his
arm
,
was
most
complaisantly
following
me
,
to
put
me
in
mind
of
my
wants
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
wrote
myself
pretty
well
out
of
conceit
with
the
desobligeant
,
and
Mons
.
<EOS>
Dessein
speaking
of
it
,
with
a
shrug
,
as
if
it
would
<EOS>
no
way
suit
me
,
it
immediately
struck
my
fancy
that
it
belong'd
to
some
Innocent
Traveller
,
who
,
on
his
return
home
,
had
left
it
to
Mons
.
<EOS>
Dessein
's
honour
to
make
the
most
of
.
 
<EOS>
Four
months
had
elapsed
since
it
had
finished
its
career
of
Europe
in
the
corner
of
Mons
.
<EOS>
Dessein
's
coach
-
yard
;
and
having
sallied
out
from
thence
but
a
vampt
-
up
business
at
the
first
,
though
it
had
been
twice
taken
to
pieces
on
Mount
Sennis
,
it
had
not
profited
much
by
its
adventures
,
 
but
by
none
so
little
as
the
standing
so
many
months
unpitied
in
the
corner
of
Mons
.
<EOS>
Dessein
's
coach
-
yard
.
 
<EOS>
Much
indeed
was
not
to
be
said
for
it
,
 
but
something
might
;
 
and
when
a
few
words
will
rescue
misery
out
of
her
distress
,
I
hate
the
man
who
can
be
a
churl
of
them
.
     
<EOS>
Now
was
I
the
master
of
this
hotel
,
said
I
,
laying
the
point
of
my
fore
-
finger
on
Mons
.
<EOS>
Dessein
's
breast
,
I
would
inevitably
make
a
point
of
getting
rid
of
this
unfortunate
desobligeant
;
 
it
stands
swinging
reproaches
at
you
every
time
you
pass
by
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mon
Dieu
!
said
Mons
.
<EOS>
Dessein
,
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
interest
 
Except
the
interest
,
said
I
,
which
men
of
a
certain
turn
of
mind
take
,
Mons
.
<EOS>
Dessein
,
in
their
own
sensations
,
 
<EOS>
I
'm
persuaded
,
to
a
man
who
feels
for
others
as
well
as
for
himself
,
every
rainy
night
,
disguise
it
as
you
will
,
<EOS>
must
cast
a
damp
upon
your
spirits
:
  
<EOS>
Y
ou
suffer
,
Mons
.
<EOS>
Dessein
,
as
much
as
the
machine
     
<EOS>
I
have
always
observed
,
when
there
is
as
much
sour
as
sweet
in
a
compliment
,
that
an
Englishman
is
eternally
at
a
loss
within
himself
,
whether
to
take
it
,
or
let
it
alone
:
 
<EOS>
a
Frenchman
never
is
:
 
Mons
.
<EOS>
Dessein
made
me
a
bow
.
  
<EOS>
C'est
bien
vrai
,
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
this
case
I
should
only
exchange
one
disquietude
for
another
,
and
with
loss
:
 
figure
to
yourself
,
my
dear
Sir
,
<EOS>
that
in
giving
you
a
chaise
which
would
fall
to
pieces
before
you
had
got
half
-
way
to
Paris
,
 
figure
to
yourself
how
much
I
should
suffer
,
in
giving
an
ill
impression
of
myself
to
a
man
of
honour
,
and
lying
at
the
mercy
,
as
I
must
do
,
d'un
homme
d'esprit
.
  
<EOS>
The
dose
was
made
up
exactly
after
my
own
prescription
;
so
I
could
not
help
tasting
it
,
 
and
,
returning
Mons
.
<EOS>
Dessein
his
bow
,
without
more
casuistry
we
walk'd
<EOS>
together
towards
his
Remise
,
to
take
a
view
of
his
magazine
of
chaises
.
  
<EOS>
IN
THE
STREET
.
 
<EOS>
CALAIS
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
needs
be
a
hostile
kind
of
a
world
,
when
the
buyer
(
if
it
be
but
of
a
sorry
post
-
chaise
)
can
not
go
forth
with
the
seller
thereof
into
the
street
to
terminate
the
difference
betwixt
them
,
but
he
instantly
falls
into
the
same
frame
of
mind
,
and
views
his
conventionist
with
the
same
sort
of
eye
,
as
if
he
was
going
along
with
him
to
Hyde
-
park
corner
to
fight
a
duel
.
 
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
being
but
a
poor
swordsman
,
and
no
way
a
match
for
Monsieur
Dessein
,
I
felt
the
rotation
of
all
the
movements
within
me
,
to
which
the
situation
is
incident
;
 
I
looked
at
Monsieur
Dessein
through
and
through
 
eyed
him
as
he
walk'd
<EOS>
along
in
profile
,
 
then
,
en
face
;
 
thought
like
a
Jew
,
 
then
a
Turk
,
 
disliked
his
wig
,
  
cursed
him
by
my
gods
,
 
wished
him
at
the
devil
.
        
<EOS>
And
is
all
this
to
be
lighted
up
in
the
heart
for
a
beggarly
account
of
three
or
four
louis
d'ors
,
which
is
the
most
I
can
be
overreached
in
?
 
<EOS>
Base
passion
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
turning
myself
about
,
as
a
man
naturally
does
upon
a
sudden
reverse
of
sentiment
,
 
base
,
ungentle
passion
!
<EOS>
thy
hand
is
against
every
man
,
and
every
man
's
hand
against
thee
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
forbid
!
<EOS>
said
she
,
raising
her
hand
up
to
her
forehead
,
for
I
had
turned
full
in
front
upon
the
lady
whom
I
had
seen
in
conference
with
the
monk
:
  
<EOS>
s
he
had
followed
us
unperceived
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
forbid
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
offering
her
my
own
;
  
she
had
a
black
pair
of
silk
gloves
,
open
only
at
the
thumb
and
two
fore
-
fingers
,
so
accepted
it
without
reserve
,
 
<EOS>
and
I
led
her
up
to
the
door
of
the
Remise
.
  
<EOS>
Monsieur
Dessein
had
diabled
the
key
above
fifty
times
before
he
had
found
out
he
had
come
with
a
wrong
one
in
his
hand
:
 
we
were
as
impatient
as
himself
to
have
it
opened
;
and
so
attentive
to
the
obstacle
that
I
continued
holding
her
hand
almost
without
knowing
it
:
 
so
that
Monsieur
Dessein
left
us
together
with
her
hand
in
mine
,
and
with
our
faces
turned
towards
the
door
of
the
Remise
,
and
said
he
would
be
back
in
five
minutes
.
  
<EOS>
Now
a
colloquy
of
five
minutes
,
in
such
a
situation
,
is
worth
one
of
as
many
ages
,
with
your
faces
turned
towards
the
street
:
 
in
the
latter
case
,
'
<EOS>
tis
drawn
from
the
objects
and
occurrences
without
<EOS>
;
  
when
your
eyes
are
fixed
upon
a
dead
blank
,
 
you
draw
purely
from
yourselves
.
 
<EOS>
A
silence
of
a
single
moment
upon
Mons
.
<EOS>
Dessein
's
leaving
us
,
had
been
fatal
to
the
situation
 
she
had
infallibly
turned
about
;
 
<EOS>
so
I
begun
the
conversation
instantly
.
        
<EOS>
But
what
were
the
temptations
(
as
I
write
not
to
apologize
for
the
weaknesses
of
my
heart
in
this
tour
,
 
but
to
give
an
account
of
them
)
 
shall
be
described
with
the
same
simplicity
with
which
I
felt
them
.
  
<EOS>
THE
REMISE
DOOR
.
 
<EOS>
CALAIS
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
told
the
reader
that
I
did
not
care
to
get
out
of
the
desobligeant
,
because
I
saw
the
monk
in
close
conference
with
a
lady
just
arrived
at
the
inn
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
the
truth
,
 
<EOS>
but
I
did
not
tell
him
the
whole
truth
;
for
I
was
as
full
as
much
restrained
by
the
appearance
and
figure
of
the
lady
he
was
talking
to
.
 
<EOS>
Suspicion
crossed
my
brain
and
said
,
he
was
telling
her
what
had
passed
:
something
jarred
upon
it
within
me
,
 
<EOS>
I
wished
him
at
his
convent
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
heart
flies
out
before
the
understanding
,
it
saves
the
judgment
a
world
of
pains
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
certain
she
was
of
a
better
order
of
beings
;
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
thought
no
more
of
her
,
but
went
on
and
wrote
my
preface
.
  
<EOS>
The
impression
returned
upon
my
encounter
with
her
in
the
street
;
a
guarded
frankness
with
which
she
gave
me
her
hand
,
showed
,
I
thought
,
her
good
education
and
her
good
sense
;
and
as
I
led
her
on
,
I
felt
a
pleasurable
ductility
about
her
,
which
spread
a
calmness
over
all
my
spirits
        
Good
God
!
<EOS>
how
a
man
might
lead
such
a
creature
as
this
round
the
world
with
him
!
     
<EOS>
I
had
not
yet
seen
her
face
 
<EOS>
'
twas
not
material
:
 
for
the
drawing
was
instantly
set
about
,
and
long
before
we
had
got
to
the
door
of
the
Remise
,
Fancy
had
finished
the
whole
head
,
and
pleased
herself
as
much
with
its
fitting
her
goddess
,
as
if
she
had
dived
into
the
Tiber
for
it
;
 
but
thou
art
a
seduced
,
and
a
seducing
slut
;
and
albeit
thou
cheatest
us
seven
times
a
day
with
thy
pictures
and
images
,
yet
with
so
many
charms
dost
thou
do
it
,
and
thou
deckest
out
thy
pictures
in
the
shapes
of
so
many
angels
of
light
,
'
tis
a
shame
to
break
with
thee
.
  
<EOS>
When
we
had
got
to
the
door
of
the
Remise
,
she
withdrew
her
hand
from
across
her
forehead
,
and
let
me
see
the
original
:
  
<EOS>
i
t
was
a
face
of
about
six
-
and
-
twenty
,
 
of
a
clear
transparent
brown
,
simply
set
off
without
rouge
or
powder
;
 
it
was
not
critically
handsome
,
but
there
was
that
in
it
,
which
,
in
the
frame
of
mind
I
was
in
,
attached
me
much
more
to
it
,
 
<EOS>
it
was
interesting
:
 
<EOS>
I
fancied
it
wore
the
characters
of
a
widow'd
look
,
and
in
that
state
of
its
declension
,
which
had
passed
the
two
first
paroxysms
of
sorrow
,
and
was
quietly
beginning
to
reconcile
itself
to
its
loss
;
 
but
a
thousand
other
distresses
might
have
traced
the
same
lines
;
I
wish'd
to
know
what
they
had
been
 
and
was
ready
to
inquire
,
(
had
the
same
bon
ton
of
conversation
permitted
,
as
in
the
days
of
Esdras
)
 
<EOS>
"
What
ailelh
thee
?
<EOS>
and
why
art
thou
disquieted
?
<EOS>
and
why
is
thy
understanding
troubled
?
"
 
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
I
felt
benevolence
for
her
;
and
resolv'd
some
way
or
other
to
throw
in
my
mite
of
courtesy
,
 
if
not
of
service
.
  
<EOS>
Such
were
my
temptations
;
 
and
in
this
disposition
to
give
way
to
them
,
was
I
left
alone
with
the
lady
with
her
hand
in
mine
,
and
with
our
faces
both
turned
closer
to
the
door
of
the
Remise
than
what
was
absolutely
necessary
.
  
<EOS>
THE
REMISE
DOOR
.
 
<EOS>
CALAIS
.
  
<EOS>
This
certainly
,
fair
lady
,
said
I
,
raising
her
hand
up
little
lightly
as
I
began
,
must
be
one
of
Fortune
's
whimsical
doings
;
to
take
two
utter
strangers
by
their
hands
,
 
of
different
sexes
,
and
perhaps
from
different
corners
of
the
globe
,
and
in
one
moment
place
them
together
in
such
a
cordial
situation
as
Friendship
herself
could
scarce
have
achieved
for
them
,
had
she
projected
it
for
a
month
.
     
<EOS>
And
your
reflection
upon
it
shows
how
much
,
Monsieur
,
she
has
embarrassed
you
by
the
adventure
     
<EOS>
When
the
situation
is
what
we
would
wish
,
nothing
is
so
ill
-
timed
as
to
hint
at
the
circumstances
which
make
it
so
:
 
<EOS>
you
thank
Fortune
,
continued
she
 
<EOS>
you
had
reason
 
<EOS>
the
heart
knew
it
,
and
was
satisfied
;
and
who
but
an
English
philosopher
would
have
sent
notice
of
it
to
the
brain
to
reverse
the
judgment
?
  
<EOS>
In
saying
this
,
she
disengaged
her
hand
with
a
look
which
I
thought
a
sufficient
commentary
upon
the
text
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
a
miserable
picture
which
I
am
going
to
give
of
the
weakness
of
my
heart
,
by
owning
,
that
it
suffered
a
pain
,
which
worthier
occasions
could
not
have
inflicted
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
mortified
with
the
loss
of
her
hand
,
and
the
manner
in
which
I
had
lost
it
carried
neither
oil
nor
wine
to
the
wound
:
 
<EOS>
I
never
felt
the
pain
of
a
sheepish
inferiority
so
miserably
in
my
life
.
  
<EOS>
The
triumphs
of
a
true
feminine
heart
are
short
upon
these
discomfitures
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
very
few
seconds
she
laid
her
hand
upon
the
cuff
of
my
coat
,
in
order
to
finish
her
reply
;
so
,
some
way
or
other
<EOS>
,
God
knows
how
,
I
regained
my
situation
.
     
<EOS>
She
had
nothing
to
add
.
  
<EOS>
I
forthwith
began
to
model
a
different
conversation
for
the
lady
,
thinking
from
the
spirit
as
well
as
moral
of
this
,
that
I
had
been
mistaken
in
her
character
;
but
upon
turning
her
face
towards
me
,
the
spirit
which
had
animated
the
reply
was
fled
,
 
the
muscles
relaxed
,
and
I
beheld
the
same
unprotected
look
of
distress
which
first
won
me
to
her
interest
:
  
m
elancholy
!
<EOS>
to
see
such
sprightliness
the
prey
of
sorrow
,
 
I
pitied
her
from
my
soul
;
and
though
it
may
seem
ridiculous
enough
to
a
torpid
heart
,
 
I
could
have
taken
her
into
my
arms
,
and
cherished
her
,
though
it
was
in
the
open
street
,
without
brushing
.
  
<EOS>
The
pulsations
of
the
arteries
along
my
fingers
pressing
across
hers
,
told
her
what
was
passing
within
me
:
 
she
looked
down
 
a
silence
of
some
moments
followed
.
  
<EOS>
I
fear
in
this
interval
,
I
must
have
made
some
slight
efforts
towards
a
closer
compression
of
her
hand
,
from
a
subtle
sensation
<EOS>
I
felt
in
the
palm
of
my
own
,
 
not
as
if
she
was
going
to
withdraw
hers
 
<EOS>
but
as
if
she
thought
about
it
;
 
and
I
had
infallibly
lost
it
a
second
time
,
had
not
instinct
more
than
reason
directed
me
to
the
last
resource
in
these
dangers
,
 
to
hold
it
loosely
,
and
in
a
manner
as
if
I
was
every
moment
going
to
release
it
,
of
myself
;
so
she
let
it
continue
,
till
Monsieur
Dessein
returned
with
the
key
;
and
in
the
mean
time
I
set
myself
to
consider
how
I
should
undo
the
ill
impressions
which
the
poor
monk
's
story
,
in
case
he
had
told
it
her
,
must
have
planted
in
her
breast
against
me
.
  
<EOS>
THE
SNUFF
BOX
.
 
<EOS>
CALAIS
.
  
<EOS>
The
good
old
monk
was
within
six
paces
of
us
,
as
the
idea
of
him
crossed
my
mind
;
and
was
advancing
towards
us
a
little
out
of
the
line
,
as
if
uncertain
whether
he
should
break
in
upon
us
or
no
.
 
<EOS>
He
stopp'd
,
however
,
as
soon
as
he
came
up
to
us
,
with
a
world
of
frankness
:
 
and
having
a
horn
snuff
box
in
his
hand
,
he
presented
it
open
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
taste
mine
 
<EOS>
said
I
,
pulling
out
my
box
(
which
was
a
small
tortoise
one
)
and
putting
it
into
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
'
Tis
most
excellent
,
said
the
monk
.
 
<EOS>
Then
do
me
the
favour
,
I
replied
,
to
accept
of
the
box
and
all
,
and
when
you
take
a
pinch
out
of
it
,
sometimes
recollect
it
was
the
peace
offering
of
a
man
who
once
used
you
unkindly
,
but
not
from
his
heart
.
  
<EOS>
The
poor
monk
<EOS>
blush'd
<EOS>
as
red
as
scarlet
.
 
<EOS>
Mon
Dieu
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
pressing
his
hands
together
 
<EOS>
you
never
used
me
unkindly
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
think
,
said
the
lady
,
he
is
not
likely
.
 
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
blush'd
<EOS>
in
my
turn
;
but
from
what
movements
,
I
leave
to
the
few
who
feel
,
to
analyze
.
  
<EOS>
Excuse
me
,
Madame
,
replied
I
,
 
<EOS>
I
treated
him
most
unkindly
;
and
from
no
provocations
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
impossible
,
said
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
My
God
!
cried
the
monk
,
with
a
warmth
of
asseveration
which
seem'd
not
to
belong
to
him
 
<EOS>
the
fault
was
in
me
,
and
in
the
indiscretion
of
my
zeal
.
 
<EOS>
The
lady
opposed
it
,
and
I
joined
with
her
in
maintaining
<EOS>
it
was
impossible
,
that
a
spirit
so
regulated
as
his
,
could
give
offence
to
any
.
  
<EOS>
I
knew
not
that
contention
could
be
rendered
so
sweet
and
pleasurable
a
thing
to
the
nerves
as
I
then
felt
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
remained
silent
,
without
any
sensation
of
that
foolish
pain
which
takes
place
,
when
,
in
such
a
circle
,
you
look
for
ten
minutes
in
one
another
's
faces
without
saying
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
Whilst
<EOS>
this
lasted
,
the
monk
rubbed
his
horn
box
upon
the
sleeve
of
his
tunic
;
and
as
soon
as
it
had
acquired
a
little
air
of
brightness
by
the
friction
 
he
made
me
a
low
bow
,
and
said
,
'
twas
too
late
to
say
whether
it
was
the
weakness
or
goodness
of
our
tempers
which
had
involved
us
in
this
contest
 
but
be
it
as
it
would
,
 
<EOS>
he
<EOS>
begg'd
<EOS>
we
might
exchange
boxes
.
 
<EOS>
In
saying
this
,
he
presented
his
to
me
with
one
hand
,
as
he
took
mine
from
me
in
the
other
,
and
having
kissed
it
,
 
with
a
stream
of
good
nature
in
his
eyes
,
he
put
it
into
his
bosom
,
 
and
took
his
leave
.
  
<EOS>
I
guard
this
box
,
as
I
would
the
instrumental
parts
of
my
religion
,
to
help
my
mind
on
to
something
better
:
 
in
truth
,
I
seldom
go
abroad
without
it
;
and
oft
and
many
a
time
<EOS>
have
I
called
up
by
it
the
courteous
spirit
of
its
owner
to
regulate
my
own
,
in
the
justlings
of
the
world
:
 
<EOS>
they
had
found
full
employment
for
his
,
as
I
learnt
from
his
story
,
till
about
the
forty
-
fifth
year
of
his
age
,
when
upon
some
military
services
ill
requited
,
and
meeting
at
the
same
time
with
a
disappointment
in
the
tenderest
of
passions
,
he
abandoned
the
sword
and
the
sex
together
,
and
took
sanctuary
not
so
much
in
his
convent
as
in
himself
.
  
<EOS>
I
feel
a
damp
upon
my
spirits
,
as
I
am
going
to
add
,
that
in
my
last
return
through
Calais
,
upon
enquiring
after
Father
Lorenzo
,
I
heard
he
had
been
dead
near
three
months
,
and
was
buried
,
not
in
his
convent
,
but
,
according
to
his
desire
,
in
a
little
cemetery
belonging
to
it
,
about
two
leagues
off
:
 
I
had
a
strong
desire
to
see
where
they
had
laid
him
,
 
when
,
upon
pulling
out
his
little
horn
box
,
as
I
sat
by
his
grave
,
and
plucking
up
a
nettle
or
two
at
the
head
of
it
,
which
had
no
business
to
grow
there
,
they
all
struck
together
so
forcibly
upon
my
affections
,
that
I
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
:
  
<EOS>
b
ut
I
am
as
weak
as
a
woman
;
and
I
beg
the
world
not
to
smile
,
but
to
pity
me
.
  
<EOS>
THE
REMISE
DOOR
.
 
<EOS>
CALAIS
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
never
quitted
the
lady
's
hand
all
this
time
,
and
had
held
it
so
long
,
that
it
would
have
been
indecent
to
have
let
it
go
,
without
first
pressing
it
to
my
lips
:
 
the
blood
and
spirits
,
which
had
suffered
a
revulsion
from
her
,
crowded
back
to
her
as
I
did
it
.
  
<EOS>
Now
the
two
travellers
,
who
had
spoke
to
me
in
the
coach
-
yard
,
happening
at
that
crisis
to
be
passing
by
,
and
observing
our
communications
,
naturally
took
it
into
their
heads
that
we
must
be
MAN
AND
WIFE
at
least
;
so
,
stopping
as
soon
as
they
came
up
to
the
door
of
the
Remise
,
the
one
of
them
who
was
the
Inquisitive
Traveller
,
ask'd
us
,
if
we
set
out
for
Paris
the
next
morning
?
 
<EOS>
I
could
only
answer
for
myself
,
I
said
;
and
the
lady
added
,
she
was
for
Amiens
.
 
<EOS>
We
dined
there
yesterday
,
said
the
Simple
Traveller
.
  
<EOS>
You
go
directly
through
the
town
,
added
the
other
,
in
your
road
to
Paris
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
going
to
return
a
thousand
thanks
for
the
intelligence
<EOS>
,
THAT
AMIENS
WAS
IN
THE
ROAD
TO
PARIS
,
but
,
upon
pulling
out
my
poor
monk
's
little
horn
box
to
take
a
pinch
of
snuff
,
I
made
them
a
quiet
bow
,
and
wishing
them
a
good
passage
to
Dover
.
 
<EOS>
They
left
us
alone
.
        
<EOS>
Now
where
would
be
the
harm
,
said
I
to
myself
,
if
I
were
to
beg
of
this
distressed
lady
to
accept
of
half
of
my
chaise
?
 
<EOS>
and
what
mighty
mischief
could
ensue
?
  
<EOS>
Every
dirty
passion
,
and
bad
propensity
in
my
nature
took
the
alarm
,
as
I
stated
the
proposition
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
oblige
you
to
have
a
third
horse
,
said
Avarice
,
which
will
put
twenty
livres
out
of
your
pocket
;
 
<EOS>
You
know
not
what
she
is
,
said
Caution
;
 
or
what
scrapes
the
affair
may
draw
you
into
,
whisper'd
Cowardice
.
     
<EOS>
Depend
upon
it
,
Yorick
!
<EOS>
said
Discretion
,
'
twill
be
said
you
went
off
with
a
mistress
,
and
came
by
assignation
to
Calais
for
that
purpose
;
        
You
can
never
after
,
cried
Hypocrisy
aloud
,
show
your
face
in
the
world
;
 
or
rise
,
quoth
Meanness
,
in
the
church
;
 
or
be
any
thing
in
it
,
said
Pride
,
but
a
lousy
prebendary
.
  
<EOS>
But
'
tis
a
civil
thing
,
said
I
;
 
<EOS>
and
as
I
generally
act
from
the
first
impulse
,
and
therefore
seldom
listen
to
these
cabals
,
which
serve
no
purpose
,
that
I
know
of
,
but
to
encompass
the
heart
with
adamant
 
<EOS>
I
turned
instantly
about
to
the
lady
.
        
<EOS>
But
she
had
glided
off
unperceived
,
as
the
cause
was
pleading
,
and
had
made
ten
or
a
dozen
paces
down
the
street
,
by
the
time
I
had
made
the
determination
;
so
I
set
off
after
her
with
a
long
stride
,
to
make
her
the
proposal
,
with
the
best
address
<EOS>
I
was
master
of
:
 
but
observing
she
<EOS>
walk'd
<EOS>
with
her
cheek
half
resting
upon
the
palm
of
her
hand
,
 
with
the
slow
short
-
measur'd
step
of
thoughtfulness
,
 
and
with
her
eyes
,
as
she
went
step
by
step
,
fixed
upon
the
ground
,
it
struck
me
she
was
trying
the
same
cause
herself
.
 
<EOS>
God
help
her
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
she
has
some
mother
-
in
-
law
,
or
tartufish
aunt
,
or
nonsensical
old
woman
,
to
consult
upon
the
occasion
,
as
well
as
myself
:
 
so
not
caring
to
interrupt
the
process
,
and
deeming
it
more
gallant
to
take
her
at
discretion
than
by
surprise
,
I
faced
about
and
took
a
short
turn
or
two
before
the
door
of
the
Remise
,
whilst
she
walk'd
<EOS>
musing
on
one
side
.
  
<EOS>
IN
THE
STREET
.
 
<EOS>
CALAIS
.
  
<EOS>
Having
,
on
the
first
sight
of
the
lady
,
settled
the
affair
in
my
fancy
"
that
she
was
of
the
better
order
of
beings
;
"
 
and
then
laid
it
down
as
a
second
axiom
,
as
indisputable
as
the
first
,
that
she
was
a
widow
,
and
wore
a
character
of
distress
,
 
<EOS>
I
went
no
further
;
I
got
ground
enough
for
the
situation
which
pleased
me
;
 
and
had
she
remained
close
beside
my
elbow
till
midnight
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
held
true
to
my
system
,
and
considered
her
only
under
that
general
idea
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
scarce
got
twenty
paces
distant
from
me
,
ere
something
within
me
called
out
for
a
more
particular
enquiry
;
 
it
brought
on
the
idea
of
a
further
separation
:
  
<EOS>
I
 
might
possibly
never
see
her
more
:
  
<EOS>
T
he
heart
is
for
saving
what
it
can
;
and
I
wanted
the
traces
through
which
my
wishes
might
find
their
way
to
her
,
in
case
I
should
never
rejoin
her
myself
;
in
a
word
,
I
wished
to
know
her
name
,
 
her
family
's
 
her
condition
;
and
as
I
knew
the
place
to
which
she
was
going
,
I
wanted
to
know
from
whence
she
came
:
 
<EOS>
but
there
was
no
coming
at
all
this
intelligence
;
a
hundred
little
delicacies
stood
in
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
form'd
<EOS>
a
score
different
plans
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
such
thing
as
a
man
's
asking
her
directly
;
 
the
thing
was
impossible
.
  
<EOS>
A
little
French
debonnaire
captain
,
who
came
dancing
down
the
street
,
showed
me
it
was
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
:
 
for
,
popping
in
betwixt
us
,
just
as
the
lady
was
returning
back
to
the
door
of
the
Remise
,
he
introduced
himself
to
my
acquaintance
,
and
before
he
had
well
got
announced
,
begg'd
<EOS>
I
would
do
him
the
honour
to
present
him
to
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
not
been
presented
myself
;
 
so
turning
about
to
her
,
he
did
it
just
as
well
,
by
asking
her
if
she
had
come
from
Paris
?
 
<EOS>
No
:
 
<EOS>
she
was
going
that
route
,
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
Vous
n'etes
pas
de
Londres
?
 
<EOS>
She
was
not
,
she
replied
.
 
<EOS>
Then
Madame
must
have
come
through
Flanders
.
 
<EOS>
Apparemment
vous
etes
Flammande
?
<EOS>
said
the
French
captain
.
 
<EOS>
The
lady
answered
,
she
was
.
 
<EOS>
Peut
etre
de
Lisle
?
<EOS>
added
he
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
,
she
was
not
of
Lisle
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
Arras
?
 
nor
Cambray
?
 
nor
Ghent
?
 
nor
Brussels
?
 
<EOS>
She
answered
,
she
was
of
Brussels
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
had
the
honour
,
he
said
,
to
be
at
the
bombardment
of
it
last
war
;
 
that
it
was
finely
situated
,
pour
cela
,
 
and
full
of
noblesse
when
the
Imperialists
were
driven
out
by
the
French
(
the
lady
made
a
slight
courtesy
)
 
<EOS>
so
giving
her
an
account
of
the
affair
,
and
of
the
share
he
had
had
in
it
,
 
<EOS>
he
begg'd
<EOS>
the
honour
to
know
her
name
<EOS>
,
 
so
made
his
bow
.
     
<EOS>
Et
Madame
a
son
Mari
?
 
<EOS>
said
he
,
looking
back
when
he
had
made
two
steps
,
 
and
,
without
staying
for
an
answer
 
danced
down
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
Had
I
served
seven
years
apprenticeship
to
good
breeding
,
I
could
not
have
done
as
much
.
  
<EOS>
THE
REMISE
.
 
<EOS>
CALAIS
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
little
French
captain
left
us
,
Mons
.
<EOS>
Dessein
came
up
with
the
key
of
the
Remise
in
his
hand
,
and
forthwith
let
us
into
his
magazine
of
chaises
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
object
which
caught
my
eye
,
as
Mons
.
<EOS>
Dessein
open'd
<EOS>
the
door
of
the
Remise
,
was
another
old
tatter'd
desobligeant
;
and
notwithstanding
it
was
the
exact
picture
of
that
which
had
hit
my
fancy
so
much
in
the
coach
-
yard
but
an
hour
before
,
 
the
very
sight
of
it
stirr'd
up
a
disagreeable
sensation
within
me
now
;
and
I
thought
'
twas
a
churlish
beast
into
whose
heart
the
idea
could
first
enter
,
to
construct
such
a
machine
;
nor
had
I
much
more
charity
for
the
man
who
could
think
of
using
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
observed
the
lady
was
as
little
taken
with
it
as
myself
:
 
so
Mons
.
<EOS>
Dessein
led
us
on
to
a
couple
of
chaises
which
stood
abreast
,
telling
us
,
as
he
recommended
them
,
that
they
had
been
purchased
by
my
lord
A.
and
B.
to
go
the
grand
tour
,
but
had
gone
no
further
than
Paris
,
so
were
in
all
respects
as
good
as
new
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
too
good
;
 
so
<EOS>
I
pass'd
on
to
a
third
,
which
stood
behind
,
and
forthwith
begun
to
chaffer
for
the
price
.
 
<EOS>
But
'
twill
scarce
hold
two
,
said
I
,
opening
the
door
and
getting
in
.
 
<EOS>
Have
the
goodness
,
Madame
,
said
Mons
.
<EOS>
Dessein
,
offering
his
arm
,
to
step
in
.
 
<EOS>
The
lady
hesitated
half
a
second
,
and
stepped
in
;
and
the
waiter
that
moment
beckoning
to
speak
to
Mon
.
<EOS>
Dessein
,
he
shut
the
door
of
the
chaise
upon
us
,
and
left
us
.
  
<EOS>
THE
REMISE
.
 
<EOS>
CALAIS
.
  
<EOS>
C'est
bien
comique
,
'
tis
very
droll
,
said
the
lady
,
smiling
,
from
the
reflection
that
this
was
the
second
time
we
a
had
been
left
together
by
a
parcel
of
nonsensical
contingencies
,
 
c'est
bien
comique
,
said
she
.
        
<EOS>
There
wants
nothing
,
said
I
,
to
make
it
<EOS>
so
<EOS>
but
the
comic
use
which
the
gallantry
of
a
Frenchman
would
put
it
to
,
 
to
make
love
the
first
moment
,
and
an
offer
of
his
person
the
second
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
<EOS>
their
fort
,
replied
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
supposed
so
at
least
;
 
and
how
it
has
come
to
pass
,
continued
I
,
I
know
not
;
but
they
have
certainly
got
the
credit
of
understanding
more
of
love
,
and
making
it
better
than
any
other
nation
upon
earth
;
but
,
for
my
own
part
,
I
think
them
arrant
bunglers
,
and
in
truth
the
worst
set
of
marksmen
that
ever
tried
Cupid
's
patience
.
     
<EOS>
To
think
of
making
love
by
SENTIMENTS
!
  
<EOS>
I
should
as
soon
think
of
making
a
genteel
suit
of
clothes
out
of
remnants
:
  
a
nd
to
do
it
 
pop
 
at
first
sight
,
by
declaration
 
is
submitting
the
offer
,
and
themselves
with
it
,
to
be
sifted
with
all
their
pours
and
contres
,
by
an
unheated
mind
.
  
<EOS>
The
lady
attended
as
if
she
expected
I
should
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
Consider
then
,
Madame
,
continued
I
,
laying
my
hand
upon
hers
:
    
<EOS>
That
grave
people
hate
love
for
the
name
's
sake
;
     
That
selfish
people
hate
it
for
their
own
;
     
Hypocrites
for
heaven
's
;
     
And
that
all
of
us
,
both
old
and
young
,
being
ten
times
worse
frightened
than
hurt
by
the
very
report
,
 
what
a
want
of
knowledge
in
this
branch
of
commence
<EOS>
a
man
betrays
,
whoever
lets
the
word
come
out
of
his
lips
,
till
an
hour
or
two
,
at
least
,
after
the
time
that
his
silence
upon
it
becomes
tormenting
.
 
<EOS>
A
course
of
small
,
quiet
attentions
,
not
so
pointed
as
to
alarm
,
 
nor
so
vague
as
to
be
misunderstood
 
with
now
<EOS>
and
then
a
look
of
kindness
,
and
little
or
nothing
said
upon
it
,
 
leaves
nature
for
your
mistress
,
and
she
fashions
it
to
her
mind
.
     
<EOS>
Then
I
solemnly
declare
,
said
the
lady
,
blushing
,
you
have
been
making
love
to
me
all
this
while
.
  
<EOS>
THE
REMISE
.
 
<EOS>
CALAIS
.
  
<EOS>
Monsieur
Dessein
came
back
to
let
us
out
of
the
chaise
,
and
acquaint
the
lady
,
the
count
de
L
#
#
#
#
,
her
brother
,
was
just
arrived
at
the
hotel
.
 
<EOS>
Though
I
had
infinite
good
will
for
the
lady
,
I
can
not
say
that
I
rejoiced
in
my
heart
at
the
event
 
and
could
not
help
telling
her
so
;
 
<EOS>
for
it
is
fatal
to
a
proposal
,
Madame
,
said
I
,
that
I
was
going
to
make
to
you
        
<EOS>
You
need
not
tell
me
what
the
proposal
was
,
said
she
,
laying
her
hand
upon
both
mine
,
as
she
interrupted
me
.
 
<EOS>
A
man
my
good
Sir
,
has
seldom
an
offer
of
kindness
to
make
to
a
woman
,
but
she
has
a
presentiment
of
it
some
moments
before
.
     
<EOS>
Nature
arms
her
with
it
,
said
I
,
for
immediate
preservation
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
think
,
said
she
,
looking
in
my
face
,
I
had
no
evil
to
apprehend
,
  
and
,
to
deal
frankly
with
you
,
had
determined
to
accept
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
had
(
she
stopped
a
moment
)
 
<EOS>
I
believe
your
good
will
would
have
drawn
a
story
from
me
,
which
would
have
made
pity
the
only
dangerous
thing
in
the
journey
.
  
<EOS>
In
saying
this
,
she
suffered
me
to
kiss
her
hand
twice
,
and
with
a
look
of
sensibility
mixed
with
concern
,
she
got
out
of
the
chaise
,
  
-and
bid
adieu
.
  
<EOS>
IN
THE
STREET
.
 
<EOS>
CALAIS
.
  
<EOS>
I
never
finished
a
twelve
guinea
bargain
so
expeditiously
in
my
life
:
 
<EOS>
my
time
seemed
heavy
,
upon
the
loss
of
the
lady
,
and
knowing
every
moment
of
it
would
be
as
two
,
till
I
put
myself
into
motion
,
  
-I
ordered
post
horses
directly
,
and
walked
towards
the
hotel
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
hearing
the
town
clock
strike
four
,
and
recollecting
that
I
had
been
little
more
than
a
single
hour
in
Calais
,
        
What
a
large
volume
of
adventures
may
be
grasped
within
this
little
span
of
life
by
him
who
interests
his
heart
in
every
thing
,
and
who
,
having
eyes
to
see
what
time
and
chance
are
perpetually
holding
out
to
him
as
he
journeyeth
on
his
way
,
misses
nothing
he
can
FAIRLY
lay
his
hands
on
!
     
<EOS>
If
this
wo
n't
turn
out
something
,
 
another
will
;
 
<EOS>
no
matter
,
  
'
tis
an
assay
upon
human
nature
 
<EOS>
I
get
my
labour
for
my
pains
,
  
'
<EOS>
tis
enough
;
 
<EOS>
the
pleasure
of
the
experiment
has
kept
my
senses
and
the
best
part
of
my
blood
awake
,
and
laid
the
gross
to
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
I
pity
the
man
who
can
travel
from
Dan
to
Beersheba
,
and
cry
,
'
Tis
all
barren
;
 
and
so
it
is
:
 
<EOS>
and
so
is
all
the
world
to
him
who
will
not
cultivate
the
fruits
it
offers
.
 
<EOS>
I
declare
,
said
I
,
clapping
my
hands
cheerily
together
,
that
were
I
in
a
desert
<EOS>
,
I
would
find
out
wherewith
in
it
to
call
forth
my
affections
:
  
<EOS>
i
f
<EOS>
I
could
not
do
better
,
I
would
fasten
them
upon
some
sweet
myrtle
,
or
seek
some
melancholy
cypress
to
connect
myself
to
;
 
I
would
court
their
shade
,
and
greet
them
kindly
for
their
protection
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
cut
my
name
upon
them
,
and
swear
they
were
the
loveliest
trees
throughout
the
desert
:
 
if
their
leaves
wither'd
,
I
would
teach
myself
to
mourn
;
and
,
when
they
rejoiced
,
I
would
rejoice
along
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
The
learned
Smelfungus
travelled
from
Boulogne
to
Paris
,
 
from
Paris
to
Rome
,
 
and
so
on
;
 
but
he
set
out
with
the
spleen
and
jaundice
,
and
every
object
he
pass'd
by
was
discoloured
or
distorted
.
 
<EOS>
He
wrote
an
account
of
them
,
but
'
twas
nothing
but
the
account
of
his
miserable
feelings
.
  
<EOS>
I
met
Smelfungus
in
the
grand
portico
of
the
Pantheon
:

<EOS>
'
TIS
NOTHING
<EOS>
BUT
A
HUGE
COCKPIT
,
said
he
:
   
<EOS>
-I
wish
you
had
said
nothing
worse
of
the
Venus
of
Medicis
<EOS>
,
replied
I
;
 
for
in
passing
through
Florence
,
I
had
heard
he
had
fallen
foul
upon
the
goddess
,
and
used
her
worse
than
a
common
strumpet
,
without
the
least
provocation
in
nature
.
  
<EOS>
I
popp'd
upon
Smelfungus
again
at
Turin
,
in
his
return
home
;
and
a
sad
tale
of
sorrowful
adventures
had
he
to
tell
,
"
wherein
he
spoke
of
moving
accidents
by
flood
and
field
,
and
of
the
cannibals
that
each
other
eat
:
 
the
Anthropophagi
:
"
 
he
had
been
flayed
alive
,
and
bedevil'd
,
and
used
worse
than
St.
Bartholomew
,
at
every
stage
he
had
come
at
.
        
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
it
,
cried
Smelfungus
,
to
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
You
had
better
tell
it
,
said
I
,
to
your
physician
.
  
<EOS>
Mundungus
,
with
an
immense
fortune
,
made
the
whole
tour
;
going
on
from
Rome
to
Naples
,
 
from
Naples
to
Venice
,
 
from
Venice
to
Vienna
,
 
to
Dresden
,
to
Berlin
,
without
one
generous
connection
or
pleasurable
anecdote
to
tell
of
;
but
he
had
travell'd
straight
on
,
looking
neither
to
his
right
hand
nor
his
left
,
lest
Love
or
Pity
should
seduce
him
out
of
his
road
.
  
<EOS>
Peace
be
to
them
!
<EOS>
if
it
is
to
be
found
;
but
heaven
itself
,
were
it
possible
to
get
there
with
such
tempers
,
would
want
objects
to
give
it
;
every
gentle
spirit
would
come
flying
upon
the
wings
of
Love
to
hail
their
arrival
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
would
the
souls
of
Smelfungus
and
Mundungus
hear
of
,
but
fresh
anthems
of
joy
,
fresh
raptures
of
love
,
and
fresh
congratulations
of
their
common
felicity
.
 
<EOS>
I
heartily
pity
them
;
they
have
brought
up
no
faculties
for
this
work
;
and
,
were
the
happiest
mansion
in
heaven
to
be
allotted
to
Smelfungus
and
Mundungus
<EOS>
,
they
would
be
so
far
from
being
happy
,
that
the
souls
of
Smelfungus
and
Mundungus
would
do
penance
there
to
all
eternity
!

MONTREUIL
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
once
lost
my
portmanteau
from
behind
my
chaise
,
and
twice
got
out
in
the
rain
,
and
one
of
the
times
up
to
the
knees
in
dirt
,
to
help
the
postilion
to
tie
it
on
,
without
being
able
to
find
out
what
was
wanting
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
it
till
I
got
to
Montreuil
,
<EOS>
upon
the
landlord
's
asking
me
if
I
wanted
not
a
servant
,
that
it
occurred
to
me
,
that
that
was
the
very
thing
.
  
<EOS>
A
servant
!
 
<EOS>
That
I
do
most
sadly
,
quoth
I.
 
<EOS>
Because
,
Monsieur
,
said
the
landlord
,
there
is
a
clever
young
fellow
,
who
would
be
very
proud
of
the
honour
to
serve
an
Englishman
.
 
<EOS>
But
why
an
English
one
,
more
than
any
other
?
 
<EOS>
They
are
so
generous
,
said
the
landlord
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
be
shot
if
this
is
not
a
livre
out
of
my
pocket
,
quoth
I
to
myself
,
this
very
night
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
have
wherewithal
to
be
so
,
Monsieur
,
added
he
.
 
<EOS>
Set
down
one
livre
more
for
that
,
quoth
<EOS>
I.
 
It
was
but
<EOS>
last
night
,
said
the
landlord
,
qu'un
milord
Anglois
presentoit
un
ecu
<EOS>
a
la
fille
de
chambre
.
 
<EOS>
Tant
pis
pour
Mademoiselle
Janatone
,
said
I.
  
Now
Janatone
,
being
the
landlord
's
daughter
,
and
the
landlord
supposing
<EOS>
I
was
young
in
French
,
took
the
liberty
to
inform
me
,
I
should
not
have
said
tant
pis
 
<EOS>
but
,
tant
mieux
.
 
<EOS>
Tant
mieux
,
toujours
,
Monsieur
,
said
he
,
when
there
is
any
thing
to
be
got
 
tant
pis
,
when
there
is
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
It
comes
to
the
same
thing
,
said
I.
 
Pardonnez
-
moi
,
said
the
landlord
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
take
a
fitter
opportunity
to
observe
,
once
for
all
,
that
tant
pis
and
tant
mieux
,
being
two
of
the
great
hinges
in
French
conversation
,
a
stranger
would
do
well
to
set
himself
right
in
the
use
of
them
,
before
he
gets
to
Paris
.
  
<EOS>
A
prompt
French
marquis
at
our
ambassador
's
table
demanded
of
Mr.
H
#
#
#
#
,
if
he
was
H
#
#
#
#
the
poet
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
said
Mr.
H
#
#
#
#
,
mildly
.
 
<EOS>
Tant
pis
,
replied
the
marquis
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
H
#
#
#
#
the
historian
,
said
another
,
 
Tant
mieux
,
said
the
marquis
.
 
<EOS>
And
Mr.
H
#
#
#
#
,
who
is
a
man
of
an
excellent
heart
,
return'd
thanks
for
both
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
landlord
had
set
me
right
in
this
matter
,
he
called
in
La
Fleur
,
which
was
the
name
of
the
young
man
he
had
spoke
of
,
 
saying
only
first
,
That
as
for
his
talents
he
would
presume
to
say
nothing
,
 
Monsieur
was
the
best
judge
what
would
suit
him
;
but
for
the
fidelity
of
La
Fleur
he
would
stand
responsible
in
all
he
was
worth
.
  
<EOS>
The
landlord
deliver'd
this
in
a
manner
which
instantly
set
my
mind
to
the
business
I
was
upon
;
 
and
La
Fleur
,
who
stood
waiting
without
,
in
that
breathless
expectation
which
every
son
of
nature
of
us
have
felt
in
our
turns
,
came
in
.
  
<EOS>
MONTREUIL
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
apt
to
be
taken
with
all
kinds
of
people
at
first
sight
;
but
never
more
so
than
when
a
poor
devil
comes
to
offer
his
service
to
so
poor
a
devil
as
myself
;
and
as
I
know
this
weakness
,
I
always
suffer
my
judgment
to
draw
back
something
on
that
very
account
,
  
and
this
more
or
less
,
according
to
the
mood
I
am
in
,
and
the
case
;
 
and
I
may
add
,
the
gender
too
,
of
the
person
I
am
to
govern
.
  
<EOS>
When
La
Fleur
entered
the
room
,
after
every
discount
I
could
make
for
my
soul
,
the
genuine
look
and
air
of
the
fellow
determined
the
matter
at
once
in
his
favour
;
so
I
hired
him
first
,
 
and
then
began
to
enquire
what
he
could
do
:
 
<EOS>
But
I
shall
find
out
his
talents
,
quoth
<EOS>
I
,
as
I
want
them
,
 
besides
,
a
Frenchman
can
do
every
thing
.
  
<EOS>
Now
poor
La
Fleur
could
do
nothing
in
the
world
but
beat
a
drum
,
and
play
a
march
or
two
upon
the
fife
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
determined
to
make
his
talents
do
;
and
ca
n't
say
my
weakness
was
ever
so
insulted
by
my
wisdom
as
in
the
attempt
.
  
<EOS>
La
Fleur
had
set
out
early
in
life
,
as
gallantly
as
most
Frenchmen
do
,
with
SERVING
for
a
few
years
;
at
the
end
of
which
,
having
satisfied
the
sentiment
,
and
found
,
moreover
,
That
the
honour
of
beating
a
drum
was
likely
to
be
its
own
reward
,
as
it
open'd
no
further
track
of
glory
to
him
,
 
he
retired
a
ses
terres
,
and
lived
comme
il
plaisoit
a
Dieu
;
 
that
is
to
say
,
upon
nothing
.
     
<EOS>
And
so
,
quoth
Wisdom
,
you
have
hired
a
drummer
to
attend
you
in
this
tour
of
yours
through
France
and
Italy
!
 
<EOS>
Psha
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
and
do
not
one
half
of
our
gentry
go
with
a
humdrum
compagnon
du
voyage
the
same
round
,
and
have
the
piper
and
the
devil
and
all
to
pay
besides
?
 
<EOS>
When
man
can
extricate
himself
with
an
equivoque
in
such
an
unequal
match
,
 
he
is
not
ill
off
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
can
do
something
else
,
<EOS>
La
Fleur
?
<EOS>
said
I.
 
O
qu'oui
!
<EOS>
he
could
make
spatterdashes
,
and
play
a
little
upon
the
fiddle
.
 
<EOS>
Bravo
!
<EOS>
said
Wisdom
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
play
a
bass
myself
,
said
I
;
 
we
shall
do
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
shave
,
and
dress
a
wig
a
little
,
La
Fleur
?
 
<EOS>
He
had
all
the
dispositions
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
enough
for
heaven
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
interrupting
him
,
 
and
ought
to
be
enough
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
supper
coming
in
,
and
having
a
frisky
English
spaniel
on
one
side
of
my
chair
,
and
a
French
valet
,
with
as
much
hilarity
in
his
countenance
as
ever
Nature
painted
in
one
,
on
the
other
,
 
<EOS>
I
was
satisfied
to
my
heart
's
content
with
my
empire
;
and
if
monarchs
knew
what
they
would
be
at
,
they
might
be
as
satisfied
as
I
was
.
  
<EOS>
MONTREUIL
.
  
<EOS>
As
La
Fleur
went
the
whole
tour
of
France
and
Italy
with
me
,
and
will
be
often
upon
the
stage
,
I
must
interest
the
reader
a
little
further
in
his
behalf
,
by
saying
,
that
I
had
never
less
reason
to
repent
of
the
impulses
which
generally
do
determine
me
,
than
in
regard
to
this
fellow
;
 
he
was
a
faithful
,
affectionate
,
simple
soul
as
ever
trudged
after
the
heels
of
a
philosopher
;
and
,
notwithstanding
his
talents
of
drum
beating
and
spatterdash
-
making
,
which
,
though
very
good
in
themselves
,
happened
to
be
of
no
great
service
to
me
,
yet
was
I
hourly
recompensed
by
the
festivity
of
his
temper
;
 
it
supplied
all
defects
:
  
<EOS>
I
 
had
a
constant
resource
in
his
looks
in
all
difficulties
and
distresses
of
my
own
 
<EOS>
I
was
going
to
have
added
of
his
too
;
but
La
Fleur
was
out
of
the
reach
of
every
thing
;
for
,
whether
'
twas
hunger
or
thirst
,
or
cold
or
nakedness
,
or
watchings
,
or
whatever
stripes
of
ill
luck
La
Fleur
met
with
in
our
journeyings
,
there
was
no
index
in
his
physiognomy
to
point
them
out
by
,
 
<EOS>
he
was
eternally
the
same
;
so
that
if
I
am
a
piece
of
a
philosopher
,
which
Satan
now
and
then
puts
it
into
my
head
I
am
,
 
it
always
mortifies
the
pride
of
the
conceit
,
by
reflecting
how
much
I
owe
to
the
complexional
philosophy
of
this
poor
fellow
,
for
shaming
me
into
one
of
a
better
kind
.
 
<EOS>
With
all
this
,
La
Fleur
had
a
small
cast
of
the
coxcomb
,
 
but
he
seemed
at
first
sight
to
be
more
a
coxcomb
of
nature
than
of
art
;
and
,
before
I
had
been
three
days
in
Paris
with
him
,
 
he
seemed
to
be
no
coxcomb
at
all
.

MONTREUIL
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
morning
,
La
Fleur
entering
upon
his
employment
,
I
delivered
to
him
the
key
of
my
portmanteau
,
with
an
inventory
of
my
half
a
dozen
shirts
and
silk
pair
of
breeches
,
and
bid
him
fasten
all
upon
the
chaise
,
 
get
the
horses
put
to
,
 
and
desire
the
landlord
to
come
in
with
his
bill
.
  
<EOS>
C'est
un
garcon
de
bonne
fortune
,
said
the
landlord
,
pointing
through
the
window
to
half
a
dozen
wenches
who
had
got
round
about
La
Fleur
,
and
were
most
kindly
taking
their
leave
of
him
,
as
the
postilion
was
leading
out
the
horses
.
 
<EOS>
La
Fleur
kissed
all
their
hands
round
and
round
again
,
and
thrice
<EOS>
he
wiped
his
eyes
,
and
thrice
<EOS>
he
promised
he
would
bring
them
all
pardons
from
Rome
.
     
<EOS>
The
young
fellow
,
said
the
landlord
,
is
beloved
by
all
the
town
,
and
there
is
scarce
a
corner
in
Montreuil
where
the
want
of
him
will
not
be
felt
:
 
<EOS>
he
has
<EOS>
but
one
misfortune
in
the
world
,
continued
he
,
"
he
is
always
in
love
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
am
heartily
glad
of
it
,
said
I
,
 
"
twill
save
me
the
trouble
every
night
of
putting
my
breeches
under
my
head
.
 
<EOS>
In
saying
this
,
I
was
making
not
so
much
La
Fleur
's
eloge
as
my
own
,
having
been
in
love
with
one
princess
or
another
almost
all
my
life
,
and
I
hope
I
shall
go
on
<EOS>
so
till
I
die
,
being
firmly
persuaded
,
that
if
ever
I
do
a
mean
action
,
it
must
be
in
some
interval
betwixt
one
passion
and
another
:
 
<EOS>
whilst
this
interregnum
lasts
,
I
always
perceive
my
heart
locked
up
,
 
<EOS>
I
can
scarce
find
in
it
to
give
Misery
a
sixpence
;
and
therefore
I
always
get
out
of
it
as
fast
as
I
can
 
and
<EOS>
the
moment
I
am
rekindled
,
I
am
all
generosity
and
good
-
will
again
;
and
would
do
anything
in
the
world
,
either
for
or
with
any
one
,
if
they
will
but
satisfy
me
there
is
no
sin
in
it
.
     
<EOS>
But
in
saying
this
,
 
sure
I
am
commanding
the
passion
,
 
not
myself
.

A
FRAGMENT
.
     
<EOS>
The
town
of
Abdera
,
notwithstanding
Democritus
lived
there
,
trying
all
the
powers
of
irony
and
laughter
to
reclaim
it
,
was
the
vilest
and
most
profligate
town
in
all
Thrace
.
 
<EOS>
What
for
poisons
,
conspiracies
,
and
assassinations
,
 
libels
,
pasquinades
,
and
tumults
,
there
was
no
going
there
by
day
 
'
twas
worse
by
night
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
when
things
were
at
the
worst
,
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Andromeda
of
Euripides
being
represented
at
Abdera
,
the
whole
orchestra
was
delighted
with
it
:
 
<EOS>
but
of
all
the
passages
which
delighted
them
,
nothing
operated
more
upon
their
imaginations
than
the
tender
strokes
of
nature
which
the
poet
had
wrought
up
in
that
pathetic
speech
of
Perseus
,
O
Cupid
,
prince
of
gods
and
men
!
<EOS>
&
c.
Every
man
almost
spoke
pure
iambics
the
next
day
,
and
talked
of
nothing
but
Perseus
his
pathetic
address
,
 
"
O
Cupid
!
<EOS>
prince
of
gods
and
men
!
"
 
<EOS>
in
every
street
of
Abdera
,
in
every
house
,
"
O
Cupid
!
<EOS>
Cupid
!
"
 
<EOS>
in
every
mouth
,
like
the
natural
notes
of

'
tis
a
cruel
journey
to
send
a
few
miserables
,
and
they
have
had
sufferings
enow
without
it
:
 
I
always
think
it
better
to
take
a
few
sous
out
in
my
hand
;
and
I
would
counsel
every
gentle
traveller
to
do
so
likewise
:
 
<EOS>
he
need
not
be
so
exact
in
setting
down
his
motives
for
giving
them
;
 
They
will
be
registered
elsewhere
.
  
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
there
is
no
man
gives
so
little
as
I
do
;
for
few
,
that
I
know
,
have
so
little
to
give
;
but
as
this
was
the
first
public
act
of
my
charity
in
France
,
I
took
the
more
notice
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
A
well
-
a
-
way
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
 
I
have
<EOS>
but
eight
sous
in
the
world
,
showing
them
in
my
hand
,
and
there
are
eight
poor
men
and
eight
poor
women
for
'em
.
  
<EOS>
A
poor
tatter'd
soul
,
without
a
shirt
on
,
instantly
withdrew
his
claim
,
by
retiring
two
steps
out
of
the
circle
,
and
making
a
disqualifying
bow
on
his
part
.
 
<EOS>
Had
the
whole
parterre
cried
out
,
Place
aux
dames
,
with
one
voice
,
it
would
not
have
conveyed
the
sentiment
of
a
deference
for
the
sex
with
half
the
effect
.
  
<EOS>
Just
Heaven
!
<EOS>
for
what
wise
reasons
hast
thou
ordered
it
,
that
beggary
and
urbanity
,
which
are
at
such
variance
in
other
countries
,
should
find
a
way
to
be
at
unity
in
this
?
     
<EOS>
I
insisted
upon
presenting
him
with
a
single
sous
,
merely
for
his
politesse
.
  
<EOS>
A
poor
little
dwarfish
brisk
fellow
,
who
stood
over
against
me
in
the
circle
,
putting
something
first
under
his
arm
,
which
had
once
been
a
hat
,
took
his
snuff
-
box
out
of
his
pocket
,
and
generously
offer'd
<EOS>
a
pinch
on
both
sides
of
him
:
 
<EOS>
it
was
a
gift
of
consequence
,
and
modestly
declined
.
  
<EOS>
T
he
poor
little
fellow
pressed
it
upon
them
with
a
nod
of
welcomeness
.
 
<EOS>
Prenez
en
 
prenez
,
said
he
,
looking
another
way
;
so
they
each
took
a
pinch
.
 
<EOS>
Pity
thy
box
should
ever
want
one
!
<EOS>
said
I
to
myself
;
so
I
put
a
couple
of
sous
into
it
 
taking
a
small
pinch
out
of
his
box
,
to
enhance
their
value
,
as
I
did
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
felt
the
weight
of
the
second
obligation
more
than
of
the
first
,
 
'
twas
doing
him
an
honour
,
 
the
other
was
only
doing
him
a
charity
;
 
and
he
made
me
a
bow
down
to
the
ground
for
it
.
     
<EOS>
Here
!
said
I
to
an
old
soldier
with
one
hand
,
who
had
been
campaigned
and
worn
out
to
death
in
the
service
 
<EOS>
here
's
a
couple
of
sous
for
thee
.
 
<EOS>
Vive
le
Roi
!
said
the
old
soldier
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
then
but
three
sous
left
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
gave
one
,
simply
,
pour
l'amour
de
Dieu
,
which
was
the
footing
on
which
it
was
begg'd
.
 
<EOS>
The
poor
woman
had
a
dislocated
hip
;
so
it
could
not
be
well
upon
any
other
motive
.
  
<EOS>
Mon
cher
<EOS>
et
tres
-
charitable
Monsieur
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
no
opposing
this
,
said
I.
  
Milord
Anglois
 
<EOS>
the
very
sound
was
worth
the
money
;
 
<EOS>
so
I
gave
MY
LAST
SOUS
FOR
IT
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
the
eagerness
of
giving
,
I
had
overlooked
a
pauvre
honteux
,
who
had
had
no
one
to
ask
a
sous
for
him
,
and
who
,
I
believe
,
would
have
perished
,
ere
he
could
have
ask'd
one
for
himself
:
 
<EOS>
he
stood
by
the
chaise
a
little
without
the
circle
,
and
wiped
a
tear
from
a
face
which
I
thought
had
seen
better
days
.
  
<EOS>
-Good
God
!
said
I
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
not
one
single
sous
left
to
give
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
have
a
thousand
!
<EOS>
cried
all
the
powers
of
nature
,
stirring
within
me
;
 
<EOS>
so
I
gave
him
 
no
matter
what
 
I
am
ashamed
to
say
HOW
MUCH
now
,
 
and
was
ashamed
to
think
how
little
,
then
:
 
<EOS>
so
,
if
the
reader
can
form
any
conjecture
of
my
disposition
,
as
these
two
fixed
points
are
given
him
,
he
may
judge
within
a
livre
or
two
<EOS>
what
was
the
precise
sum
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
afford
nothing
for
the
rest
,
but
Dieu
vous
benisse
!
     
<EOS>
Et
le
bon
Dieu
vous
benisse
encore
,
said
the
old
soldier
,
the
dwarf
,
&
c.
 
<EOS>
The
pauvre
honteux
could
say
nothing
;
 
he
pull'd
out
a
little
handkerchief
,
and
wiped
his
face
as
he
turned
away
 
<EOS>
and
I
thought
he
thanked
me
more
than
them
all
.
  
<EOS>
THE
BIDET
.
  
<EOS>
Having
settled
all
these
little
matters
,
I
got
into
my
post
-
chaise
with
more
ease
than
ever
I
got
into
a
post
-
chaise
in
my
life
;
and
La
Fleur
having
got
one
large
jack
-
boot
on
the
far
side
of
a
little
bidet
,
and
another
on
this
(
for
I
count
nothing
of
his
legs
)
 
<EOS>
he
canter'd
away
before
me
as
happy
and
as
perpendicular
as
a
prince
.
  
<EOS>
-But
<EOS>
what
is
happiness
!
<EOS>
what
is
grandeur
in
this
painted
scene
of
life
!
 
<EOS>
A
dead
ass
,
before
we
had
got
a
league
,
put
a
sudden
stop
to
La
Fleur
's
career
;
 
his
bidet
would
not
pass
by
it
,
 
<EOS>
a
contention
arose
betwixt
them
,
and
the
poor
fellow
was
kick'd
out
of
his
jack
-
boots
the
very
first
kick
.
  
<EOS>
La
Fleur
bore
his
fall
like
a
French
Christian
,
saying
neither
more
nor
less
upon
it
,
than
Diable
!
 
<EOS>
So
presently
got
up
,
and
came
to
the
charge
again
astride
his
bidet
,
beating
him
up
to
it
as
he
would
have
beat
his
drum
.
  
<EOS>
The
bidet
flew
from
one
side
of
the
road
to
the
other
,
then
back
again
,
 
then
this
way
,
then
that
way
,
and
in
short
,
every
way
but
by
the
dead
ass
:
  
L
a
Fleur
insisted
upon
the
thing
 
and
the
bidet
threw
him
.
  
<EOS>
What
's
the
matter
,
La
Fleur
,
said
I
,
with
this
bidet
of
thine
?
<EOS>
Monsieur
,
said
he
,
c'est
un
cheval
le
plus
opiniatre
du
monde
.
  
<EOS>
Nay
,
if
he
is
a
conceited
beast
,
he
must
go
his
own
way
,
replied
<EOS>
I.
So
La
Fleur
got
off
him
,
and
giving
him
a
good
sound
lash
,
the
bidet
took
me
at
my
word
,
and
away
he
scampered
back
to
Montreuil
.
  
<EOS>
-Peste
<EOS>
!
said
La
Fleur
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
not
mal
-
a
-
propos
to
take
notice
here
,
that
though
La
Fleur
availed
himself
but
of
two
different
terms
of
exclamation
in
this
encounter
,
 
namely
,
Diable
!
<EOS>
and
Peste
!
<EOS>
that
there
are
,
nevertheless
,
three
in
the
French
language
:
 
like
the
positive
,
comparative
,
and
superlative
,
one
or
the
other
of
which
serves
for
every
unexpected
throw
of
the
dice
in
life
.
  
<EOS>
Le
Diable
!
<EOS>
which
is
the
first
,
and
positive
degree
,
is
generally
used
upon
ordinary
emotions
of
the
mind
,
where
small
things
only
fall
out
contrary
to
your
expectations
;
such
as
 
the
throwing
once
doublets
 
<EOS>
La
Fleur
's
being
kick'd
<EOS>
off
his
horse
,
and
so
forth
.
  
<EOS>
Cuckoldom
,
for
the
same
reason
,
is
always
 
Le
Diable
!
  
<EOS>
But
,
in
cases
where
the
cast
has
something
provoking
in
it
,
as
in
that
of
the
bidet
's
running
away
after
,
and
leaving
La
Fleur
aground
in
jack
-
boots
,
 
'
tis
the
second
degree
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
then
Peste
!
  
<EOS>
And
for
the
third
        
<EOS>
But
here
my
heart
is
wrung
with
pity
and
fellow
feeling
,
when
I
reflect
what
miseries
must
have
been
their
lot
,
and
how
bitterly
so
refined
a
people
must
have
smarted
,
to
have
forced
them
upon
the
use
of
it
.
     
<EOS>
Grant
me
,
<EOS>
O
ye
powers
which
touch
the
tongue
with
eloquence
in
distress
!
 
<EOS>
what
ever
is
my
CAST
,
grant
me
but
decent
words
to
exclaim
in
,
and
I
will
give
my
nature
way
.
     
<EOS>
But
as
these
were
not
to
be
had
in
France
,
I
resolved
to
take
every
evil
just
as
it
befell
me
,
without
any
exclamation
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
La
Fleur
,
who
had
made
no
such
covenant
with
himself
,
followed
the
bidet
with
his
eyes
till
it
was
got
out
of
sight
,
 
and
then
,
you
may
imagine
,
if
you
please
,
with
what
word
he
closed
the
whole
affair
.
  
<EOS>
As
there
was
no
hunting
down
a
frightened
horse
in
jack
-
boots
,
there
remained
no
alternative
but
taking
La
Fleur
either
behind
the
chaise
,
or
into
it
.
     
<EOS>
I
preferred
the
latter
,
and
in
half
an
hour
we
got
to
the
post
-
house
at
Nampont
.
  
<EOS>
NAMPONT
.
 
<EOS>
THE
DEAD
ASS
.
     
<EOS>
And
this
,
said
he
,
putting
the
remains
of
a
crust
into
his
wallet
 
and
this
should
have
been
thy
portion
,
said
he
,
hadst
thou
been
alive
to
have
shared
it
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
,
by
the
accent
,
it
had
been
an
apostrophe
to
his
child
;
<EOS>
but
'
twas
to
his
ass
,
and
to
the
very
ass
we
had
seen
dead
in
the
road
,
which
had
occasioned
La
Fleur
's
misadventure
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
seemed
to
lament
it
much
;
and
it
instantly
brought
into
my
mind
Sancho
's
lamentation
for
his
;
but
he
did
it
with
more
true
touches
of
nature
.
  
<EOS>
The
mourner
was
sitting
upon
a
stone
bench
at
the
door
,
with
the
ass
's
pannel
and
its
bridle
on
one
side
,
which
he
took
up
from
time
to
time
,
 
then
laid
them
down
,
 
look'd
at
them
,
and
shook
his
head
.
<EOS>
He
then
took
his
crust
of
bread
out
of
his
wallet
again
,
as
if
to
eat
it
;
held
it
some
time
in
his
hand
,
 
then
laid
it
upon
the
bit
of
his
ass
's
bridle
,
 
looked
wistfully
at
the
little
arrangement
he
had
made
 
and
then
gave
a
sigh
.
  
<EOS>
The
simplicity
of
his
grief
drew
numbers
about
him
,
and
La
Fleur
amongst
the
rest
,
whilst
the
horses
were
getting
ready
;
as
I
continued
sitting
in
the
post
-
chaise
,
I
could
see
and
hear
over
their
heads
.
     
<EOS>
He
said
he
had
come
last
from
Spain
,
where
he
had
been
from
the
furthest
borders
of
Franconia
;
and
had
got
so
far
on
his
return
home
,
when
his
ass
died
.
 
<EOS>
Every
one
seemed
desirous
to
know
what
business
could
have
taken
so
old
and
poor
a
man
so
far
a
journey
from
his
own
home
.
  
<EOS>
It
had
pleased
heaven
,
he
said
,
to
bless
him
with
three
sons
,
the
finest
lads
in
Germany
;
but
having
in
one
week
lost
two
of
the
eldest
of
them
by
the
small
-
pox
,
and
the
youngest
falling
ill
of
the
same
distemper
,
he
was
afraid
of
being
bereft
of
them
all
;
and
made
a
vow
,
if
heaven
would
not
take
him
from
him
also
,
he
would
go
in
gratitude
to
St.
Iago
in
Spain
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
mourner
got
thus
far
on
his
story
,
he
stopp'd
<EOS>
to
pay
Nature
her
tribute
,
 
and
wept
bitterly
.
  
<EOS>
He
said
,
heaven
had
accepted
the
conditions
;
and
that
he
had
set
out
from
his
cottage
with
this
poor
creature
,
who
had
been
a
patient
partner
of
his
journey
;
 
that
it
had
eaten
the
same
bread
with
him
all
the
way
,
and
was
unto
him
as
a
friend
.
  
<EOS>
Every
body
who
stood
about
,
heard
the
poor
fellow
with
concern
.
 
<EOS>
La
Fleur
offered
him
money
.
 
<EOS>
The
mourner
said
he
did
not
want
it
;
 
it
was
not
the
value
of
the
ass
 
<EOS>
but
the
loss
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
ass
,
he
said
,
he
was
assured
,
loved
him
;
 
and
upon
this
told
them
a
long
story
of
a
mischance
upon
their
passage
over
the
Pyrenean
mountains
,
which
had
separated
them
from
each
other
three
days
;
during
which
time
the
ass
had
sought
him
as
much
as
he
had
sought
the
ass
,
and
that
they
had
scarce
either
eaten
or
drank
till
they
met
.
  
<EOS>
Thou
hast
<EOS>
one
comfort
,
friend
,
said
I
,
at
least
,
in
the
loss
of
thy
poor
beast
;
I
'm
sure
thou
hast
been
a
merciful
master
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
Alas
<EOS>
!
said
the
mourner
,
I
thought
so
when
he
was
alive
;
 
but
now
that
he
is
dead
,
I
think
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
the
weight
of
myself
and
my
afflictions
together
have
been
too
much
for
him
,
 
<EOS>
they
have
shortened
the
poor
creature
's
days
,
and
I
fear
I
have
them
to
answer
for
.
 
<EOS>
Shame
on
the
world
!
<EOS>
said
I
to
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Did
<EOS>
we
but
love
each
other
as
this
poor
soul
loved
his
ass
"
twould
be
something
.
     
<EOS>
NAMPONT
.
 
<EOS>
THE
POSTILION
.
  
<EOS>
The
concern
which
the
poor
fellow
's
story
threw
me
into
required
some
attention
;
the
postilion
paid
not
the
least
to
it
,
but
set
off
upon
the
pave
in
a
full
gallop
.
  
<EOS>
The
thirstiest
soul
in
the
most
sandy
desert
of
Arabia
could
not
have
wished
more
for
a
cup
of
cold
water
,
than
mine
did
for
grave
and
quiet
movements
;
and
I
should
have
had
an
high
opinion
of
the
postilion
<EOS>
had
he
but
stolen
off
with
me
in
something
like
a
pensive
pace
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
as
the
mourner
finished
his
lamentation
,
the
fellow
gave
an
unfeeling
lash
to
each
of
his
beasts
,
and
set
off
clattering
like
a
thousand
devils
.
  
<EOS>
I
called
to
him
as
loud
as
I
could
,
for
heaven
's
sake
to
go
slower
:
  
a
nd
<EOS>
the
louder
I
called
<EOS>
,
the
more
unmercifully
he
galloped
.
 
<EOS>
The
deuce
take
him
and
his
galloping
too
 
<EOS>
said
I
,
 
<EOS>
he
'll
go
on
tearing
my
nerves
to
pieces
till
he
has
worked
me
into
a
foolish
passion
,
and
then
he
'll
go
slow
that
I
may
enjoy
the
sweets
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
postilion
managed
the
point
to
a
miracle
:
 
by
the
time
he
had
got
to
the
foot
of
a
steep
hill
,
about
half
a
league
from
Nampont
,
  
-he
had
put
me
out
of
temper
with
him
,
 
and
then
with
myself
,
for
being
so
.
  
<EOS>
My
case
then
required
a
different
treatment
;
and
a
good
rattling
gallop
would
have
been
of
real
service
to
me
.
        
<EOS>
Then
,
prithee
,
get
on
 
get
on
,
my
good
lad
,
said
I.
  
<EOS>
The
postilion
pointed
to
the
hill
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
tried
to
return
back
to
the
story
of
the
poor
German
and
his
ass
 
<EOS>
but
I
had
broke
the
clue
,
 
and
could
no
more
get
into
it
again
,
than
the
postilion
could
into
a
trot
.
     
<EOS>
The
deuce
go
,
said
I
,
with
it
all
!
 
<EOS>
Here
am
I
sitting
as
candidly
disposed
to
make
the
best
of
the
worst
,
as
ever
wight
was
,
and
all
runs
counter
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
one
sweet
lenitive
at
least
for
evils
,
which
Nature
holds
out
to
us
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
took
it
kindly
at
her
hands
,
and
fell
asleep
;
and
the
first
word
which
roused
me
was
Amiens
.
     
<EOS>
Bless
me
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
rubbing
my
eyes
,
 
this
is
the
very
town
where
my
poor
lady
is
to
come
.
  
<EOS>
AMIENS
.
  
<EOS>
The
words
were
scarce
out
of
my
mouth
when
the
Count
de
L
#
#
#
#
's
post
-
chaise
,
with
his
sister
in
it
,
drove
hastily
by
:
 
<EOS>
she
had
just
time
to
make
me
a
bow
of
recognition
,
 
and
of
that
particular
kind
of
it
,
which
told
me
she
had
not
yet
done
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
as
good
as
her
look
;
for
,
before
I
had
quite
finished
my
supper
,
her
brother
's
servant
came
into
the
room
with
a
billet
,
in
which
she
said
she
had
taken
the
liberty
to
charge
me
with
a
letter
,
which
I
was
to
present
myself
to
Madame
R
#
#
#
#
<EOS>
the
first
morning
I
had
nothing
to
do
at
Paris
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
only
added
,
she
was
sorry
,
but
from
what
penchant
she
had
not
considered
,
that
she
had
been
prevented
telling
me
her
story
,
 
that
she
still
owed
it
to
me
;
and
if
my
route
should
ever
lay
through
Brussels
,
and
I
had
not
by
then
forgot
the
name
of
Madame
de
L
#
#
#
#
,
 
that
Madame
de
L
#
#
#
#
would
be
glad
to
discharge
her
obligation
.
  
<EOS>
Then
I
will
meet
thee
,
said
I
,
fair
spirit
!
<EOS>
at
Brussels
;
 
'
tis
only
returning
from
Italy
through
Germany
to
Holland
,
by
the
route
of
Flanders
,
home
;
 
"
twill
scarce
be
ten
posts
out
of
my
way
;
but
,
were
it
ten
thousand
!
<EOS>
with
what
a
moral
delight
will
it
crown
my
journey
,
in
sharing
in
the
sickening
incidents
of
a
tale
of
misery
told
to
me
by
such
a
sufferer
?
 
<EOS>
To
see
her
weep
!
<EOS>
and
,
though
I
can
not
dry
up
the
fountain
of
her
tears
,
what
an
exquisite
sensation
is
there
still
left
,
in
wiping
them
away
from
off
the
cheeks
of
the
first
and
fairest
of
women
,
as
I
'm
sitting
with
my
handkerchief
in
my
hand
in
silence
the
whole
night
beside
her
?
  
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
wrong
in
the
sentiment
;
and
yet
I
instantly
reproached
my
heart
with
it
in
the
bitterest
and
most
reprobate
of
expressions
.
  
<EOS>
It
had
ever
,
as
I
told
the
reader
,
been
one
of
the
singular
blessings
of
my
life
,
to
be
almost
every
hour
of
it
miserably
in
love
with
some
one
;
and
my
last
flame
happening
to
be
blown
out
by
a
whiff
of
jealousy
on
the
sudden
turn
of
a
corner
<EOS>
,
I
had
lighted
it
up
afresh
at
the
pure
taper
of
Eliza
but
about
three
months
before
,
 
<EOS>
swearing
,
as
I
did
it
,
that
it
should
last
me
through
the
whole
journey
.
 
<EOS>
Why
should
I
dissemble
the
matter
?
 
<EOS>
I
had
sworn
to
her
eternal
fidelity
;
 
she
had
a
right
to
my
whole
heart
:
  
<EOS>
t
o
divide
my
affections
was
to
lessen
them
;
 
to
expose
them
was
to
risk
them
:
 
where
there
is
risk
<EOS>
there
may
be
loss
:
  
a
nd
what
wilt
<EOS>
thou
have
,
Yorick
,
to
answer
to
a
heart
so
full
of
trust
and
confidence
 
<EOS>
so
good
,
so
gentle
,
and
unreproaching
!
     
<EOS>
I
will
not
go
to
Brussels
,
replied
I
,
interrupting
myself
.
 
<EOS>
But
my
imagination
went
on
,
 
<EOS>
I
recalled
her
looks
at
that
crisis
of
our
separation
,
when
neither
of
us
had
power
to
say
adieu
!
 
<EOS>
I
look'd
<EOS>
at
the
picture
she
had
tied
in
a
black
riband
about
my
neck
,
 
and
blush'd
as
I
look'd
<EOS>
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
given
the
world
to
have
kiss'd
<EOS>
it
,
 
but
was
ashamed
.
 
<EOS>
And
shall
this
tender
flower
,
said
I
,
pressing
it
between
my
hands
,
 
shall
it
be
smitten
to
its
very
root
,
 
and
smitten
,
Yorick
!
<EOS>
by
thee
,
who
hast
promised
to
shelter
it
in
thy
breast
?
  
<EOS>
Eternal
Fountain
of
Happiness
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
kneeling
down
upon
the
ground
,
 
be
thou
my
witness
 
and
every
pure
spirit
which
tastes
it
,
be
my
witness
also
,
That
I
would
not
travel
to
Brussels
,
unless
Eliza
went
along
with
me
,
did
the
road
lead
me
towards
heaven
!
  
<EOS>
In
transports
of
this
kind
,
the
heart
,
in
spite
of
the
understanding
,
will
always
say
too
much
.
  
<EOS>
THE
LETTER
.
 
<EOS>
AMIENS
.
  
<EOS>
Fortune
had
not
smiled
upon
La
Fleur
;
for
he
had
been
unsuccessful
in
his
feats
of
chivalry
,
 
and
not
one
thing
had
offered
to
signalise
his
zeal
for
my
service
from
the
time
that
he
had
entered
into
it
,
which
was
almost
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
.
 
<EOS>
The
poor
soul
burn'd
with
impatience
;
and
the
Count
de
L
#
#
#
#
's
servant
coming
with
the
letter
,
being
the
first
practicable
occasion
which
offer'd
,
La
Fleur
had
laid
hold
of
it
;
and
,
in
order
to
do
honour
to
his
master
,
had
taken
him
into
a
back
parlour
in
the
auberge
,
and
treated
him
with
a
cup
or
two
of
the
best
wine
in
Picardy
;
and
the
Count
de
L
#
#
#
#
's
servant
,
in
return
,
and
not
to
be
behindhand
in
politeness
with
La
Fleur
,
had
taken
him
back
with
him
to
the
Count
's
hotel
.
 
<EOS>
La
Fleur
's
PREVENANCY
(
for
there
was
a
passport
in
his
very
looks
)
soon
set
every
servant
in
the
kitchen
at
ease
with
him
;
and
as
a
Frenchman
,
whatever
be
his
talents
,
has
no
sort
of
prudery
in
showing
them
,
La
Fleur
,
in
less
than
five
minutes
,
had
pulled
out
his
fife
,
and
leading
off
the
dance
himself
with
the
first
note
,
set
the
fille
de
chambre
,
the
maitre
d'hotel
,
the
cook
,
the
scullion
,
and
all
the
house
-
hold
,
dogs
and
cats
,
besides
an
old
monkey
,
a
dancing
:
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
there
never
was
a
merrier
kitchen
since
the
flood
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
de
L
#
#
#
#
,
in
passing
from
her
brother
's
apartments
to
her
own
,
<EOS>
hearing
so
much
jollity
below
stairs
,
rung
up
her
fille
de
chambre
to
ask
about
it
;
and
,
hearing
it
was
the
English
gentleman
's
servant
,
who
had
set
the
whole
house
merry
with
his
pipe
,
she
ordered
him
up
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
poor
fellow
could
not
present
himself
empty
,
he
had
loaded
himself
in
going
up
stairs
with
a
thousand
compliments
to
Madame
de
L
#
#
#
#
,
on
the
part
of
his
master
,
 
added
a
long
apocrypha
of
inquiries
after
Madame
de
L
#
#
#
#
's
health
,
 
told
her
,
that
Monsieur
his
master
was
au
desespoire
for
her
re
-
establishment
from
the
fatigues
of
her
journey
,
 
and
,
to
close
all
,
that
Monsieur
had
received
the
letter
which
Madame
had
done
him
the
honour
 
<EOS>
And
he
has
done
me
the
honour
,
said
Madame
de
L
#
#
#
#
,
<EOS>
interrupting
La
Fleur
,
to
send
a
billet
in
return
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
de
L
#
#
#
#
had
said
this
with
such
a
tone
of
reliance
upon
the
fact
,
that
La
Fleur
had
not
power
to
disappoint
her
expectations
;
  
he
trembled
for
my
honour
,
 
and
possibly
might
not
altogether
be
unconcerned
for
his
own
,
as
a
man
capable
of
being
attached
to
a
master
who
could
be
wanting
en
egards
vis
a
vis
d'une
femme
!
<EOS>
so
that
when
Madame
de
L
#
#
#
#
asked
La
Fleur
if
he
had
brought
a
letter
,
  
O
qu'oui
,
said
La
Fleur
:
 
<EOS>
so
laying
down
his
hat
upon
the
ground
,
and
taking
hold
of
the
flap
of
his
right
side
pocket
with
his
left
hand
,
he
began
to
search
for
the
letter
with
his
right
;
 
then
contrariwise
.
 
<EOS>
Diable
!
<EOS>
then
sought
every
pocket
 
pocket
by
pocket
,
round
,
not
forgetting
his
fob
:
  
Peste
!
 
<EOS>
then
La
Fleur
emptied
them
upon
the
floor
,
 
pulled
out
a
dirty
cravat
,
 
a
handkerchief
,
 
a
comb
,
 
a
whip
lash
,
 
a
nightcap
,
 
then
gave
a
peep
into
his
hat
,
  
<EOS>
Quelle
etourderie
!
 
<EOS>
He
had
left
the
letter
upon
the
table
in
the
auberge
;
 
he
would
run
for
it
,
and
be
back
with
it
in
three
minutes
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
just
finished
my
supper
when
La
Fleur
came
in
to
give
me
an
account
of
his
adventure
:
 
<EOS>
he
told
the
whole
story
simply
as
it
was
:
 
and
only
added
that
if
Monsieur
had
forgot
(
par
hazard
)
to
answer
Madame
's
letter
,
the
arrangement
gave
him
an
opportunity
to
recover
the
faux
pas
;
 
and
if
not
,
that
things
were
only
as
they
were
.
  
<EOS>
Now
I
was
not
altogether
sure
of
my
etiquette
,
whether
I
ought
to
have
wrote
or
no
;
 
<EOS>
but
if
I
had
,
 
a
devil
himself
could
not
have
been
angry
:
 
'
twas
but
the
officious
zeal
of
a
well
meaning
creature
for
my
honour
;
and
,
however
he
might
have
mistook
the
road
,
 
or
embarrassed
me
in
so
doing
,
 
<EOS>
his
heart
was
in
no
fault
,
  
<EOS>
I
was
under
no
necessity
to
write
;
 
and
,
what
weighed
more
than
all
,
 
<EOS>
he
did
not
look
as
if
he
had
done
amiss
.
     
<EOS>
'
Tis
all
very
well
,
La
Fleur
,
said
I.
 
'
Twas
sufficient
.
 
<EOS>
La
Fleur
flew
out
of
the
room
like
lightning
,
and
returned
with
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
in
his
hand
;
and
,
coming
up
to
the
table
,
laid
them
close
before
me
,
with
such
a
delight
in
his
countenance
,
that
I
could
not
help
taking
up
the
pen
.
  
<EOS>
I
began
and
began
again
;
and
,
though
I
had
nothing
to
say
,
and
that
nothing
might
have
been
expressed
in
half
a
dozen
lines
,
I
made
half
a
dozen
different
beginnings
,
and
could
no
way
please
myself
.
  
<EOS>
In
short
,
I
was
in
no
mood
to
write
.
  
<EOS>
La
Fleur
stepp'd
out
and
brought
a
little
water
in
a
glass
to
dilute
my
ink
,
 
then
fetch'd
sand
and
seal
-
wax
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
all
one
;
I
wrote
,
and
blotted
,
and
tore
off
,
and
burnt
,
and
wrote
again
.
 
<EOS>
Le
diable
l'emporte
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
half
to
myself
,
 
I
can
not
write
this
self
-
same
letter
,
throwing
the
pen
down
despairingly
as
I
said
it
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
I
had
cast
down
my
pen
,
La
Fleur
advanced
with
the
most
respectful
carriage
up
to
the
table
,
and
making
a
thousand
apologies
for
the
liberty
he
was
going
to
take
,
told
me
he
had
a
letter
in
his
pocket
wrote
by
a
drummer
in
his
regiment
to
a
corporal
's
wife
,
which
he
durst
say
would
suit
the
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
a
mind
to
let
the
poor
fellow
have
his
humour
.
 
<EOS>
Then
prithee
,
said
I
,
let
me
see
it
.
  
<EOS>
La
Fleur
instantly
pulled
out
a
little
dirty
pocket
book
cramm'd
full
of
small
letters
and
billet
-
doux
in
a
sad
condition
,
and
laying
it
upon
the
table
,
and
then
untying
the
string
which
held
them
all
together
,
run
them
over
,
one
by
one
,
till
he
came
to
the
letter
in
question
,
 
La
voila
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
clapping
his
hands
:
 
so
,
unfolding
it
first
,
he
laid
it
open
before
me
,
and
retired
three
steps
from
the
table
whilst
I
read
it
.

THE
LETTER
.
  
<EOS>
Madame

Je
suis
penetre
de
la
douleur
la
plus
vive
<EOS>
,
et
reduit

<EOS>
Mais

<EOS>
L'amour
n'est

<EOS>
Et
le
sentiment
est
encore
moins
sans
amour
.
  
<EOS>
On
dit
qu'on
ne
doit
jamais
se
desesperer

<EOS>
On
dit
aussi
que

Je

It
was
but
changing
the
Corporal
into
the
Count
,
 
and
saying
nothing
about
mounting
guard
on
Wednesday
,
 
and
the
letter
was
neither
right
nor
wrong
:
  
<EOS>
s
o
,
to
gratify
the
poor
fellow
,
who
stood
trembling
for
my
honour
,
his
own
,
and
the
honour
of
his
letter
<EOS>
,
 
I
took
the
cream
gently
off
it
,
and
whipping
it
up
in
my
own
way
,
I
seal'd
it
up
and
sent
him
with
it
to
Madame
de
L
#
#
#
#
;
 
and
the
next
morning
we
pursued
our
journey
to
Paris
.
  
<EOS>
PARIS
.
  
<EOS>
When
a
man
can
contest
the
point
by
dint
of
equipage
,
and
carry
all
on
floundering
before
him
with
half
a
dozen
of
lackies
and
a
couple
of
cooks
 
'
tis
very
well
in
such
a
place
as
Paris
,
 
he
may
drive
in
at
which
end
of
a
street
he
will
.
  
<EOS>
A
poor
prince
who
is
weak
in
cavalry
,
and
whose
whole
infantry
does
not
exceed
a
single
man
,
had
best
quit
the
field
,
and
signalize
himself
in
the
cabinet
,
if
he
can
get
up
into
it
;
 
<EOS>
I
say
UP
INTO
<EOS>
IT
 
<EOS>
for
there
is
no
descending
perpendicular
amongst
'em
with
a
"
Me
voici
!
<EOS>
mes
enfans
"
 
<EOS>
h
ere
<EOS>
I
am
 
whatever
many
may
think
.
  
<EOS>
I
own
my
first
sensations
,
as
soon
as
I
was
left
solitary
and
alone
in
my
own
chamber
in
the
hotel
,
were
far
from
being
so
flattering
as
I
had
prefigured
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
walked
up
gravely
to
the
window
in
my
dusty
black
coat
,
and
looking
through
the
glass
saw
all
the
world
in
yellow
,
blue
,
and
green
,
running
at
the
ring
of
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
with
broken
lances
,
and
in
helmets
which
had
lost
their
vizards
;
 
the
young
in
armour
<EOS>
bright
which
shone
like
gold
,
beplumed
with
each
gay
feather
of
the
east
,
 
all
,
 
all
,
tilting
at
it
like
fascinated
knights
in
tournaments
of
yore
for
fame
and
love
.
     
<EOS>
Alas
,
poor
Yorick
!
<EOS>
cried
I
,
what
art
thou
doing
here
?
 
<EOS>
On
the
very
first
onset
of
all
this
glittering
clatter
thou
art
reduced
to
an
atom
;
 
seek
,
 
seek
some
winding
alley
,
with
a
tourniquet
at
the
end
of
it
,
where
chariot
never
rolled
or
flambeau
shot
its
rays
;
 
there
thou
mayest
solace
thy
soul
in
converse
sweet
with
some
kind
grisette
of
a
barber
's
wife
,
and
get
into
such
coteries
!
        
<EOS>
May
I
perish
!
<EOS>
if
I
do
,
said
I
,
pulling
out
the
letter
which
I
had
to
present
to
Madame
de
R
#
#
#
#
  
<EOS>
I
'll
wait
upon
this
lady
,
the
very
first
thing
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
called
La
Fleur
to
go
seek
me
a
barber
directly
,
 
and
come
back
and
brush
my
coat
.
  
<EOS>
THE
WIG
.
 
<EOS>
PARIS
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
barber
came
,
he
absolutely
refused
to
have
any
thing
to
do
with
my
wig
:
 
'
twas
either
above
or
below
his
art
:
 
<EOS>
I
had
nothing
to
do
but
<EOS>
to
take
one
ready
made
of
his
own
recommendation
.
     
<EOS>
But
I
fear
,
friend
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
this
buckle
wo
n't
stand
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
emerge
it
,
replied
he
,
into
the
ocean
,
and
it
will
stand
.
     
<EOS>
What
a
great
scale
is
every
thing
upon
in
this
city
<EOS>
thought
I.
 
<EOS>
The
utmost
stretch
of
an
English
periwig
-
maker
's
ideas
could
have
gone
no
further
than
to
have
"
dipped
it
into
a
pail
of
water
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
What
difference
!
'
<EOS>
tis
like
Time
to
Eternity
!
  
<EOS>
I
confess
I
do
hate
all
cold
conceptions
,
as
I
do
the
puny
ideas
which
engender
them
;
and
am
generally
so
struck
with
the
great
works
of
nature
,
that
for
my
own
part
,
if
I
could
help
it
,
I
never
would
make
a
comparison
less
than
a
mountain
at
least
.
 
<EOS>
All
that
can
be
said
against
the
French
sublime
,
in
this
instance
of
it
,
is
this
:
  
T
hat
<EOS>
the
grandeur
is
MORE
in
the
WORD
,
and
LESS
in
the
THING
.
 
<EOS>
No
doubt
,
the
ocean
fills
the
mind
with
vast
ideas
;
but
Paris
being
so
far
inland
<EOS>
,
it
was
not
likely
I
should
run
post
a
hundred
miles
out
of
it
,
to
try
the
experiment
;
 
the
Parisian
barber
meant
nothing
.
     
<EOS>
The
pail
of
water
standing
beside
the
great
deep
,
makes
,
certainly
,
but
a
sorry
figure
in
speech
;
 
but
,
'
twill
be
said
,
 
it
has
one
advantage
 
'
tis
in
the
next
room
,
and
the
truth
of
the
buckle
may
be
tried
in
it
,
without
more
ado
,
in
a
single
moment
.
  
<EOS>
In
honest
truth
,
and
upon
a
more
candid
revision
of
the
matter
,
THE
FRENCH
EXPRESSION
PROFESSES
MORE
THAN
IT
PERFORMS
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
I
can
see
the
precise
and
distinguishing
marks
of
national
characters
more
in
these
nonsensical
minutiae
than
in
the
most
important
matters
of
state
;
where
great
men
of
all
nations
talk
and
stalk
so
much
alike
,
that
I
would
not
give
ninepence
to
choose
amongst
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
so
long
in
getting
from
under
my
barber
's
hands
,
that
it
was
too
late
to
think
of
going
with
my
letter
to
Madame
R
#
#
#
#
that
night
:
but
when
a
man
is
once
dressed
at
all
points
for
going
out
,
his
reflections
turn
to
little
account
;
so
taking
down
the
name
of
the
Hotel
de
Modene
,
where
I
lodged
,
I
walked
forth
without
any
determination
where
to
go
;
 
I
shall
consider
of
that
,
said
I
,
as
I
walk
along
.

THE
PULSE
.
 
<EOS>
PARIS
.
  
<EOS>
Hail
,
ye
small
sweet
courtesies
of
life
,
for
smooth
do
ye
make
the
road
of
it
!
<EOS>
like
grace
and
beauty
,
which
beget
inclinations
to
love
at
first
sight
:
 
'
tis
ye
who
open
this
door
and
let
the
stranger
in
.
     
<EOS>
Pray
,
Madame
,
said
I
,
have
the
goodness
to
tell
me
which
way
I
must
turn
to
go
to
the
Opera
Comique
?
 
<EOS>
Most
willingly
,
Monsieur
,
said
she
,
laying
aside
her
work
.
     
<EOS>
I
had
given
a
cast
with
my
eye
into
half
a
dozen
shops
,
as
I
came
along
,
in
search
of
a
face
<EOS>
not
likely
to
be
disordered
by
such
an
interruption
:
 
till
at
last
,
this
,
hitting
my
fancy
,
I
had
walked
in
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
working
a
pair
of
ruffles
,
as
she
sat
in
a
low
chair
,
on
the
far
side
of
the
shop
,
facing
the
door
.
     
<EOS>
Tres
volontiers
,
most
willingly
,
said
she
,
laying
her
work
down
upon
a
chair
next
her
,
and
rising
up
from
the
low
chair
she
was
sitting
in
,
with
so
cheerful
a
movement
,
and
so
cheerful
a
look
,
that
had
I
been
laying
out
fifty
louis
d'ors
with
her
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
said
 
"
This
woman
is
grateful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
You
must
turn
,
Monsieur
,
said
she
,
going
with
me
to
the
door
of
the
shop
,
and
pointing
the
way
down
the
street
<EOS>
I
was
to
take
,
 
you
must
turn
first
to
your
left
hand
,
 
mais
prenez
garde
 
<EOS>
there
are
two
turns
;
and
be
so
good
as
to
take
the
second
 
then
go
down
a
little
way
<EOS>
and
you
'll
see
a
church
:
 
<EOS>
and
,
when
you
are
past
it
,
give
yourself
the
trouble
to
turn
directly
to
the
right
,
and
that
will
lead
you
to
the
foot
of
the
Pont
Neuf
,
which
you
must
cross
 
and
there
any
one
will
do
himself
the
pleasure
to
show
you
.
     
<EOS>
She
repeated
her
instructions
three
times
over
to
me
,
with
the
same
goodnatur'd
<EOS>
patience
the
third
time
as
the
first
;
 
and
if
TONES
AND
MANNERS
have
a
meaning
,
which
certainly
they
have
,
<EOS>
unless
to
hearts
which
shut
them
out
,
 
she
seemed
really
interested
that
I
should
not
lose
myself
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
not
suppose
it
was
the
woman
's
beauty
,
notwithstanding
<EOS>
she
was
the
handsomest
grisette
<EOS>
,
I
think
,
I
ever
saw
,
which
had
much
to
do
with
the
sense
I
had
of
her
courtesy
;
only
I
remember
,
when
I
told
her
how
much
I
was
obliged
to
her
,
that
I
looked
very
full
in
her
eyes
,
 
and
that
I
repeated
my
thanks
as
often
as
she
had
done
her
instructions
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
not
got
ten
paces
from
the
door
,
before
I
found
I
had
forgot
every
tittle
of
what
she
had
said
;
 
so
looking
back
,
and
seeing
her
still
standing
in
the
door
of
the
shop
,
as
if
to
look
whether
I
went
right
or
not
,
 
I
returned
back
to
ask
her
,
whether
the
first
turn
was
to
my
right
or
left
,
 
for
that
I
had
absolutely
forgot
.
  
<EOS>
Is
it
possible
!
<EOS>
said
she
,
half
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
very
possible
,
replied
I
,
when
a
man
is
thinking
more
of
a
woman
than
of
her
good
advice
.
  
<EOS>
As
this
was
the
real
truth
 
<EOS>
she
took
it
,
as
every
woman
takes
a
matter
of
right
,
with
a
slight
curtsey
.
     
<EOS>
Attendez
!
<EOS>
said
she
,
laying
her
hand
upon
my
arm
to
detain
me
,
whilst
she
called
a
lad
out
of
the
back
shop
to
get
ready
a
parcel
of
gloves
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
just
going
to
send
him
,
said
she
,
with
a
packet
into
that
quarter
,
and
if
you
will
have
the
complaisance
to
step
in
,
it
will
be
ready
in
a
moment
,
and
he
shall
attend
you
to
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
walk'd
in
with
her
to
the
far
side
of
the
shop
:
 
and
taking
up
the
ruffle
in
my
hand
which
she
laid
upon
the
chair
,
as
if
I
had
a
mind
to
sit
,
she
sat
down
herself
in
her
low
chair
,
and
I
instantly
sat
myself
down
beside
her
.
     
<EOS>
He
will
be
ready
,
Monsieur
,
said
she
,
in
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
And
in
that
moment
,
replied
I
,
most
willingly
would
I
say
something
very
civil
to
you
for
all
these
courtesies
.
 
<EOS>
Any
one
may
do
a
casual
act
of
good
nature
,
but
a
continuation
of
them
shows
it
is
a
part
of
the
temperature
;
and
certainly
,
added
I
,
if
it
is
the
same
blood
which
comes
from
the
heart
which
descends
to
the
extremes
(
touching
her
wrist
)
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
must
have
one
of
the
best
pulses
of
any
woman
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
Feel
it
,
said
she
,
holding
out
her
arm
.
 
<EOS>
So
laying
down
my
hat
,
I
took
hold
of
her
fingers
in
one
hand
,
and
applied
the
two
forefingers
of
my
other
to
the
artery
.
        
<EOS>
Would
to
heaven
!
<EOS>
my
dear
Eugenius
,
thou
hadst
passed
by
,
and
beheld
me
sitting
in
my
black
coat
,
and
in
my
lack
-
a
-
day
-
sical
manner
,
counting
the
throbs
of
it
,
one
by
one
,
with
as
much
true
devotion
as
if
I
had
been
watching
the
critical
ebb
or
flow
of
her
fever
.
 
<EOS>
How
wouldst
thou
have
laugh'd
and
moralized
upon
my
new
profession
!
 
<EOS>
and
thou
shouldst
have
laugh'd
and
moralized
on
.
  
<EOS>
Trust
me
,
my
dear
Eugenius
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
said
,
"
There
are
worse
occupations
in
this
world
THAN
FEELING
A
WOMAN
'S
PULSE
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
a
grisette
's

<EOS>
thou
wouldst
have
said
,
 
and
in
an
open
shop
!
 
<EOS>
Yorick
        
<EOS>
So
much
the
better
:
 
<EOS>
for
when
my
views
are
direct
,
Eugenius
,
I
care
not
if
all
the
world
saw
me
feel
it

THE

<EOS>
PARIS
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
counted
twenty
pulsations
,
and
was
going
on
fast
towards
the
fortieth
,
when
her
husband
,
coming
unexpected
from
a
back
parlour
into
the
shop
,
put
me
a
little
out
of
my
reckoning
.
 
<EOS>
'
Twas
nobody
but
her
husband
<EOS>
,
she
said
;
 
<EOS>
so
I
began
a
fresh
score
.
 
<EOS>
Monsieur
is
so
good
,
quoth
<EOS>
she
,
as
he
pass'd
by
us
,
as
to
give
himself
the
trouble
of
feeling
my
pulse
.
 
<EOS>
The
husband
took
off
his
hat
,
and
making
me
a
bow
,
said
,
I
did
him
too
much
honour
 
and
having
said
that
,
he
put
on
his
hat
and
walk'd
out
.
  
<EOS>
Good
God
!
<EOS>
said
I
to
myself
,
as
he
went
out
,
 
and
can
this
man
be
the
husband
of
this
woman
!
  
<EOS>
Let
it
not
torment
the
few
who
know
what
must
have
been
the
grounds
of
this
exclamation
,
if
I
explain
it
to
those
who
do
not
.
  
<EOS>
In
London
a
shopkeeper
and
a
shopkeeper
's
wife
seem
to
be
one
bone
and
one
flesh
:
 
in
the
several
endowments
of
mind
and
body
,
sometimes
the
one
,
sometimes
the
other
has
it
,
so
as
,
in
general
,
to
be
upon
a
par
,
and
totally
with
each
other
as
nearly
as
man
and
wife
need
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
In
Paris
,
there
are
scarce
two
orders
of
beings
more
different
:
for
the
legislative
and
executive
powers
of
the
shop
not
resting
in
the
husband
,
he
seldom
comes
there
:
  
<EOS>
i
n
<EOS>
some
dark
and
dismal
room
behind
,
he
sits
commerce
-
less
,
in
his
thrum
nightcap
,
the
same
rough
son
of
Nature
that
Nature
left
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
genius
of
a
people
,
where
nothing
but
the
monarchy
is
salique
,
having
ceded
this
department
,
with
sundry
others
,
totally
to
the
women
,
 
by
a
continual
higgling
with
customers
of
all
ranks
and
sizes
from
morning
to
night
,
like
so
many
rough
pebbles
shook
long
together
in
a
bag
,
by
amicable
collisions
they
have
worn
down
their
asperities
and
sharp
angles
,
and
not
only
become
round
and
smooth
,
but
will
receive
,
some
of
them
,
a
polish
like
a
brilliant
:
   
<EOS>
Monsieur
le
Mari
is
little
better
than
the
stone
under
your
foot
.
     
<EOS>
Surely
,
 
surely
,
man
!
<EOS>
it
is
not
good
for
thee
to
sit
alone
:
   
thou
wast
made
for
social
intercourse
and
gentle
greetings
;
and
this
improvement
of
our
natures
from
it
<EOS>
I
appeal
to
as
my
evidence
.
     
<EOS>
And
how
does
it
beat
,
Monsieur
?
<EOS>
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
With
all
the
benignity
,
said
I
,
looking
quietly
in
her
eyes
,
that
I
expected
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
going
to
say
something
civil
in
return
 
<EOS>
but
the
lad
came
into
the
shop
with
the
gloves
.
 
<EOS>
A
propos
<EOS>
,
said
I
,
I
want
a
couple
of
pairs
myself
.
  
<EOS>
THE
GLOVES
.
 
<EOS>
PARIS
.
  
<EOS>
The
beautiful
grisette
rose
up
when
I
said
this
,
and
going
behind
the
counter
,
reach'd
down
a
parcel
and
untied
it
:
 
<EOS>
I
advanced
to
the
side
over
against
her
:
 
<EOS>
they
were
all
too
large
.
 
<EOS>
The
beautiful
grisette
measured
them
one
by
one
across
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
not
alter
their
dimensions
.
 
<EOS>
She
begg'd
<EOS>
I
would
try
a
single
pair
,
which
seemed
to
be
the
least
.
 
<EOS>
She
held
it
open
;
 
my
hand
slipped
into
it
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
not
do
,
said
I
,
shaking
my
head
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
said
she
,
doing
the
same
thing
.
  
<EOS>
There
are
certain
combined
looks
of
simple
subtlety
,
 
where
whim
,
and
sense
,
and
seriousness
,
and
nonsense
,
are
so
blended
,
that
all
the
languages
of
Babel
set
loose
together
,
could
not
express
them
;
  
-they
are
communicated
and
caught
so
instantaneously
,
<EOS>
that
you
can
scarce
say
which
party
is
the
infector
.
 
<EOS>
I
leave
it
to
your
men
of
words
to
swell
pages
about
it
 
<EOS>
it
is
enough
in
the
present
to
say
again
,
the
gloves
would
not
do
;
so
,
folding
our
hands
within
our
arms
<EOS>
,
we
both
lolled
upon
the
counter
 
<EOS>
it
was
narrow
,
and
there
was
just
room
for
the
parcel
to
lay
between
us
.
  
<EOS>
The
beautiful
grisette
looked
sometimes
at
the
gloves
,
then
sideways
to
the
window
,
then
at
the
gloves
,
 
and
then
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
not
disposed
to
break
silence
:
  
<EOS>
I
 
followed
her
example
:
 
<EOS>
so
,
I
looked
at
the
gloves
,
then
to
the
window
,
then
at
the
gloves
,
and
then
at
her
,
 
and
so
on
alternately
.
  
<EOS>
I
found
I
lost
considerably
in
every
attack
:
  
<EOS>
s
he
had
a
quick
black
eye
,
and
shot
through
two
such
long
and
silken
eyelashes
with
such
penetration
,
that
she
look'd
<EOS>
into
my
very
heart
and
reins
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
seem
strange
,
but
I
could
actually
feel
she
did
.
     
<EOS>
It
is
no
matter
,
said
I
,
taking
up
a
couple
of
the
pairs
next
me
,
and
putting
them
into
my
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
sensible
the
beautiful
grisette
had
not
asked
above
a
single
livre
above
the
price
.
 
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
wish'd
she
had
asked
a
livre
more
,
and
was
puzzling
my
brains
how
to
bring
the
matter
about
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
think
,
my
dear
Sir
,
said
she
,
mistaking
my
embarrassment
,
that
I
could
ask
a
sous
too
much
of
a
stranger
 
and
of
a
stranger
whose
politeness
,
more
than
his
want
of
gloves
,
has
done
me
the
honour
to
lay
himself
at
my
mercy
?
 
<EOS>
M'en
croyez
capable
?
 
<EOS>
Faith
!
<EOS>
not
I
,
said
I
;
and
if
you
were
,
you
are
welcome
.
 
<EOS>
So
counting
the
money
into
her
hand
,
and
with
a
lower
bow
than
one
generally
makes
to
a
shopkeeper
's
wife
,
I
went
out
,
and
her
lad
with
his
parcel
followed
me
.
  
<EOS>
THE
TRANSLATION
.
 
<EOS>
PARIS
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
nobody
in
the
box
I
was
let
into
but
a
kindly
old
French
officer
.
 
<EOS>
I
love
the
character
,
not
only
because
I
honour
the
man
whose
manners
are
softened
by
a
profession
which
makes
bad
men
worse
;
but
that
I
once
knew
one
,
 
for
he
is
no
more
,
 
and
why
should
I
not
rescue
one
page
from
violation
by
writing
his
name
in
it
,
and
telling
the
world
it
was
Captain
Tobias
Shandy
,
the
dearest
of
my
flock
and
friends
,
whose
philanthropy
I
never
think
of
at
this
long
distance
from
his
death
 
<EOS>
but
my
eyes
gush
out
with
tears
.
<EOS>
For
his
sake
I
have
a
predilection
for
the
whole
corps
of
veterans
;
and
so
I
strode
over
the
two
back
rows
of
benches
and
placed
myself
beside
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
officer
was
reading
attentively
a
small
pamphlet
,
it
might
be
the
book
of
the
opera
,
with
a
large
pair
of
spectacles
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
I
sat
down
,
he
took
his
spectacles
off
,
and
putting
them
into
a
shagreen
case
,
return'd
them
and
the
book
into
his
pocket
together
.
<EOS>
I
half
rose
up
,
and
made
him
a
bow
.
  
<EOS>
Translate
this
into
any
civilized
language
in
the
world
 
<EOS>
the
sense
is
this
:
  
<EOS>
"
Here
's
a
poor
stranger
come
into
the
box
 
<EOS>
he
seems
as
if
he
knew
nobody
;
and
is
never
likely
,
was
he
to
be
seven
years
in
Paris
,
if
every
man
he
comes
near
keeps
his
spectacles
upon
his
nose
:
  
'
tis
shutting
the
door
of
conversation
absolutely
in
his
face
 
and
using
him
worse
than
a
German
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
French
officer
might
as
well
have
said
it
all
aloud
:
 
and
if
he
had
,
I
should
in
course
have
put
the
bow
I
made
him
into
French
too
,
and
told
him
,
"
I
was
sensible
of
his
attention
,
and
return'd
him
a
thousand
thanks
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
is
not
a
secret
so
aiding
to
the
progress
of
sociality
,
as
to
get
master
of
this
SHORT
HAND
,
and
to
be
quick
in
rendering
the
several
turns
of
looks
and
limbs
with
all
their
inflections
and
delineations
,
into
plain
words
.
 
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
by
long
habitude
,
I
do
it
so
mechanically
,
that
,
when
I
walk
the
streets
of
London
,
I
go
translating
all
the
way
;
and
have
more
than
once
stood
behind
in
the
circle
,
where
not
three
words
have
been
said
,
and
have
brought
off
twenty
different
dialogues
with
me
,
which
I
could
have
fairly
wrote
down
and
sworn
to
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
going
one
evening
to
Martini
's
concert
at
Milan
,
and
,
was
just
entering
the
door
of
the
hall
,
when
the
Marquisina
di
F
#
#
#
#
was
coming
out
in
a
sort
of
a
hurry
:
  
<EOS>
s
he
was
almost
upon
me
before
I
saw
her
;
so
I
gave
a
spring
to
once
side
to
let
her
pass
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
done
the
same
,
and
on
the
same
side
too
;
so
we
ran
our
heads
together
:
 
<EOS>
she
instantly
got
to
the
other
side
to
get
out
:
 
<EOS>
I
was
just
as
unfortunate
as
she
had
been
,
for
I
had
sprung
to
that
side
,
and
opposed
her
passage
again
.
 
<EOS>
We
both
flew
together
to
the
other
side
,
and
then
back
,
 
and
so
on
:
  
<EOS>
i
t
was
ridiculous
:
 
we
both
<EOS>
blush'd
<EOS>
intolerably
:
 
so
I
did
at
last
the
thing
I
should
have
done
at
first
;
 
I
stood
stock
-
still
,
and
the
Marquisina
had
no
more
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
no
power
to
go
into
the
room
,
till
I
had
made
her
so
much
reparation
as
to
wait
and
follow
her
with
my
eye
to
the
end
of
the
passage
.
 
<EOS>
She
look'd
back
twice
,
<EOS>
and
walk'd
<EOS>
along
it
rather
sideways
,
as
if
she
would
make
room
for
any
one
coming
up
stairs
to
pass
her
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
said
I
 
<EOS>
that
's
a
vile
translation
:
 
<EOS>
the
Marquisina
has
a
right
to
the
best
apology
I
can
make
her
,
and
that
opening
is
left
for
me
to
do
it
in
;
 
so
I
ran
and
<EOS>
begg'd
pardon
for
the
embarrassment
I
had
given
her
,
saying
it
was
my
intention
to
have
made
her
way
.
 
<EOS>
She
answered
,
she
was
guided
by
the
same
intention
towards
me
;
 
<EOS>
so
we
reciprocally
thank'd
<EOS>
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
;
and
seeing
no
cicisbeo
near
her
,
I
begg'd
to
hand
her
to
her
coach
;
 
<EOS>
so
we
went
down
the
stairs
,
stopping
at
every
third
step
to
talk
of
the
concert
and
the
adventure
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
,
Madame
,
said
I
,
when
I
had
handed
her
in
,
I
made
six
different
efforts
to
let
you
go
out
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
made
six
efforts
,
replied
she
,
to
let
you
enter
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
to
heaven
you
would
make
a
seventh
,
said
I.
 
With
all
my
heart
,
said
she
,
making
room
.
  
<EOS>
-Life
is
too
short
to
be
long
about
the
forms
of
it
,
 
so
I
instantly
stepp'd
<EOS>
in
,
and
she
carried
me
home
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
And
what
became
of
the
concert
,
St.
Cecilia
,
who
I
suppose
was
at
it
,
knows
more
than
I.
  
<EOS>
I
will
only
add
,
that
the
connexion
which
arose
out
of
the
translation
gave
me
more
pleasure
than
any
one
I
had
the
honour
to
make
in
Italy
.
  
<EOS>
THE
DWARF
.
 
<EOS>
PARIS
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
never
heard
the
remark
made
by
any
one
in
my
life
,
except
by
one
;
and
who
that
was
will
probably
come
out
in
this
chapter
;
so
that
being
pretty
much
unprepossessed
,
there
must
have
been
grounds
for
what
struck
me
the
moment
I
cast
my
eyes
over
the
parterre
,
  
and
that
was
,
the
unaccountable
sport
of
Nature
in
forming
such
numbers
of
dwarfs
.
 
<EOS>
No
doubt
she
sports
at
certain
times
in
almost
every
corner
of
the
world
;
but
in
Paris
there
is
no
end
to
her
amusements
.
 
<EOS>
The
goddess
seems
almost
as
merry
as
she
is
wise
.
  
<EOS>
As
I
carried
my
idea
out
of
the
Opera
Comique
with
me
,
I
measured
every
body
I
saw
walking
in
the
streets
by
it
.
 
<EOS>
Melancholy
application
!
<EOS>
especially
where
the
size
was
extremely
little
,
 
the
face
extremely
dark
,
 
the
eyes
quick
,
 
the
nose
long
,
 
the
teeth
white
,
 
the
jaw
prominent
,
 
to
see
so
many
miserables
,
by
force
of
accidents
driven
out
of
their
own
proper
class
into
the
very
verge
of
another
,
which
it
gives
me
pain
to
write
down
:
  
<EOS>
e
very
third
man
a
pigmy
!
 
<EOS>
some
by
rickety
heads
and
hump
backs
;
 
others
by
bandy
legs
;
 
<EOS>
a
third
set
arrested
by
the
hand
of
Nature
in
the
sixth
and
seventh
years
of
their
growth
;
 
a
fourth
,
in
their
perfect
and
natural
state
like
dwarf
apple
trees
;
from
the
first
rudiments
and
stamina
of
their
existence
,
never
meant
to
grow
higher
.
  
<EOS>
A
Medical
Traveller
might
say
,
'
tis
owing
to
undue
bandages
;
 
a
Splenetic
one
,
to
want
of
air
;
 
and
an
Inquisitive
Traveller
,
to
fortify
the
system
,
may
measure
the
height
of
their
houses
,
 
the
narrowness
of
their
streets
,
and
in
how
few
feet
square
in
the
sixth
and
seventh
stories
such
numbers
of
the
bourgeoisie
eat
and
sleep
together
;
but
I
remember
Mr.
Shandy
the
elder
,
who
accounted
for
nothing
like
any
body
else
,
in
speaking
one
evening
of
these
matters
,
averred
that
children
,
like
other
animals
,
might
be
increased
almost
to
any
size
,
provided
they
came
right
into
the
world
;
but
the
misery
was
,
the
citizens
of
were
Paris
<EOS>
so
coop'd
up
,
that
they
had
not
actually
room
enough
to
get
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
call
it
getting
anything
,
said
he
;
 
'
tis
getting
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
continued
he
,
rising
in
his
argument
,
'
tis
getting
worse
than
nothing
,
when
all
you
have
got
after
twenty
or
five
and
twenty
years
of
the
tenderest
care
and
most
nutritious
aliment
bestowed
upon
it
,
shall
not
at
last
be
as
high
as
my
leg
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
Mr.
Shandy
being
very
short
,
there
could
be
nothing
more
said
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
As
this
is
not
a
work
of
reasoning
,
I
leave
the
solution
as
I
found
it
,
and
content
myself
with
the
truth
only
of
the
remark
,
which
is
verified
in
every
lane
and
by
-
lane
of
Paris
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
walking
down
that
which
leads
from
the
Carousal
to
the
Palais
Royal
,
and
observing
a
little
boy
in
some
distress
at
the
side
of
the
gutter
which
ran
down
the
middle
of
it
<EOS>
,
I
took
hold
of
his
hand
and
help'd
him
over
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
turning
up
his
face
to
look
at
him
after
,
I
perceived
he
was
about
forty
.
 
<EOS>
Never
mind
,
said
I
,
some
good
body
will
do
as
much
for
me
when
I
am
ninety
.
  
<EOS>
I
feel
some
little
principles
within
me
which
incline
me
to
be
merciful
towards
this
poor
blighted
part
of
my
species
,
who
have
neither
size
nor
strength
to
get
on
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
to
see
one
of
them
trod
upon
;
and
had
scarce
got
seated
beside
my
old
French
officer
,
ere
<EOS>
the
disgust
was
exercised
,
by
seeing
the
very
thing
happen
under
the
box
we
sat
in
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
the
orchestra
,
and
betwixt
that
and
the
first
side
box
,
there
is
a
small
esplanade
left
,
where
,
when
the
house
is
full
,
numbers
of
all
ranks
take
sanctuary
.
 
<EOS>
Though
you
stand
,
as
in
the
parterre
,
you
pay
the
same
price
as
in
the
orchestra
.
 
<EOS>
A
poor
defenceless
being
of
this
order
had
got
thrust
somehow
or
other
into
this
luckless
place
;
 
the
night
was
hot
,
and
he
was
surrounded
by
beings
two
feet
and
a
half
higher
than
himself
.
 
<EOS>
The
dwarf
suffered
inexpressibly
on
all
sides
;
but
the
thing
which
incommoded
him
most
,
was
a
tall
corpulent
German
,
near
seven
feet
high
,
who
stood
directly
betwixt
him
and
all
possibility
of
his
seeing
either
the
stage
or
the
actors
.
 
<EOS>
The
poor
dwarf
did
all
he
could
to
get
a
peep
at
what
was
going
forwards
,
by
seeking
for
some
little
opening
betwixt
the
German
's
arm
and
his
body
,
trying
first
on
one
side
,
then
the
other
;
but
the
German
stood
square
in
the
most
unaccommodating
posture
that
can
be
imagined
:
  
<EOS>
t
he
dwarf
might
as
well
have
been
placed
at
the
bottom
of
the
deepest
draw
-
well
in
Paris
;
so
he
civilly
reached
up
his
hand
to
the
German
's
sleeve
,
and
told
him
his
distress
.
 
<EOS>
The
German
turn'd
<EOS>
his
head
back
,
looked
down
upon
him
as
Goliah
did
upon
David
,
 
and
unfeelingly
resumed
his
posture
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
just
then
taking
a
pinch
of
snuff
out
of
my
monk
's
little
horn
box
.
 
<EOS>
And
how
would
thy
meek
and
courteous
spirit
,
<EOS>
my
dear
monk
!
<EOS>
so
temper'd
to
BEAR
AND
FORBEAR
!
 
<EOS>
how
sweetly
would
it
have
lent
an
ear
to
this
poor
soul
's
complaint
!
  
<EOS>
The
old
French
officer
,
seeing
me
lift
up
my
eyes
with
an
emotion
,
as
I
made
the
apostrophe
,
took
the
liberty
to
ask
me
what
was
the
matter
?
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
the
story
in
three
words
;
and
added
,
how
inhuman
it
was
.
  
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
dwarf
was
driven
to
extremes
,
and
in
his
first
transports
,
which
are
generally
unreasonable
,
had
told
the
German
he
would
cut
off
his
long
queue
with
his
knife
.
 
<EOS>
The
German
look'd
<EOS>
back
coolly
,
and
told
him
he
was
welcome
,
if
he
could
reach
it
.
  
<EOS>
An
injury
sharpen'd
by
an
insult
,
be
it
to
whom
it
will
,
makes
every
man
of
sentiment
a
party
:
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
leap'd
out
of
the
box
to
have
redressed
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
French
officer
did
it
with
much
less
confusion
;
for
leaning
a
little
over
,
and
nodding
to
a
sentinel
,
and
pointing
at
the
same
time
with
his
finger
at
the
distress
,
 
the
sentinel
made
his
way
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
occasion
to
tell
the
grievance
,
 
the
thing
told
himself
;
so
thrusting
back
the
German
instantly
with
his
musket
,
 
he
took
the
poor
dwarf
by
the
hand
,
and
placed
him
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
noble
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
clapping
my
hands
together
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
you
would
not
permit
this
,
said
the
old
officer
,
in
England
.
     
<EOS>
In
England
,
dear
Sir
,
said
I
,
WE
SIT
ALL
<EOS>
AT
OUR
EASE
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
French
officer
would
have
set
me
at
unity
with
myself
,
in
case
<EOS>
I
had
been
at
variance
,
 
by
saying
it
was
a
bon
mot
;
 
and
,
as
a
bon
mot
is
always
worth
something
at
Paris
,
he
offered
me
a
pinch
of
snuff
.
  
<EOS>
THE
ROSE
.
 
<EOS>
PARIS
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
now
my
turn
to
ask
the
old
French
officer
<EOS>
"
What
was
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
for
a
cry
of
"
Haussez
les
mains
,
Monsieur
l'Abbe
!
<EOS>
"
re
-
echoed
from
a
dozen
different
parts
of
the
parterre
,
was
as
unintelligible
to
me
,
as
my
apostrophe
to
the
monk
had
been
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
told
me
it
was
some
poor
Abbe
in
one
of
the
upper
loges
,
who
,
he
supposed
,
had
got
planted
perdu
behind
a
couple
of
grisettes
in
order
to
see
the
opera
,
and
that
the
parterre
espying
him
,
were
insisting
upon
his
holding
up
both
his
hands
during
the
representation
.
 
<EOS>
And
can
it
be
supposed
,
said
I
,
that
an
ecclesiastic
would
pick
the
grisettes
'
pockets
?
 
<EOS>
The
old
French
officer
smiled
,
and
whispering
in
my
ear
,
opened
a
door
of
knowledge
which
I
had
no
idea
of
.
  
<EOS>
Good
God
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
turning
pale
with
astonishment
 
is
it
possible
,
that
a
people
so
smit
with
sentiment
should
at
the
same
time
be
so
unclean
,
and
<EOS>
so
unlike
themselves
,
 
Quelle
grossierte
!
<EOS>
added
I.
  
<EOS>
The
French
officer
told
me
,
it
was
an
illiberal
sarcasm
at
the
church
,
which
had
begun
in
the
theatre
about
the
time
the
Tartuffe
was
given
in
it
by
Moliere
:
 
but
like
other
remains
of
Gothic
manners
,
was
declining
.
 
<EOS>
Every
nation
,
continued
he
,
have
their
refinements
and
grossiertes
,
in
which
they
take
the
lead
,
and
lose
it
of
one
another
by
turns
:
  
t
hat
he
had
been
in
most
countries
,
but
never
in
one
where
he
found
not
some
delicacies
,
which
others
seemed
to
want
.
 
<EOS>
Le
POUR
et
le
CONTRE
<EOS>
se
trouvent
en
chaque
nation
;
there
is
a
balance
,
said
he
,
of
good
and
bad
everywhere
;
and
nothing
but
the
knowing
it
is
so
,
can
emancipate
one
half
of
the
world
from
the
prepossession
which
it
holds
against
the
other
:
   
that
the
advantage
of
travel
,
as
it
regarded
the
scavoir
vivre
,
was
by
seeing
a
great
deal
both
of
men
and
manners
;
it
taught
us
mutual
toleration
;
and
mutual
toleration
,
concluded
he
,
making
me
a
bow
,
taught
us
mutual
love
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
French
officer
delivered
this
with
an
air
of
such
candour
and
good
sense
,
as
coincided
with
my
first
favourable
impressions
of
his
character
:
  
<EOS>
I
 
thought
I
loved
the
man
;
but
<EOS>
I
fear
I
mistook
the
object
;
 
'
twas
my
own
way
of
thinking
 
the
difference
was
,
I
could
not
have
expressed
it
half
so
well
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
alike
troublesome
to
both
the
rider
and
his
beast
,
 
if
the
latter
goes
pricking
up
his
ears
,
and
starting
all
the
way
at
every
object
which
he
never
saw
before
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
as
little
torment
of
this
kind
as
any
creature
alive
;
<EOS>
and
yet
I
honestly
confess
,
that
many
a
thing
gave
me
pain
,
and
that
I
blush'd
<EOS>
at
many
a
word
the
first
month
,
 
which
I
found
inconsequent
and
perfectly
innocent
the
second
.

Madame
do
Rambouliet
,
after
an
acquaintance
of
about
six
weeks
with
her
,
had
done
me
the
honour
to
take
me
in
her
coach
about
two
leagues
out
of
town
.
 
<EOS>
Of
all
women
,
Madame
de
Rambouliet
is
the
most
correct
;
and
I
never
wish
to
see
one
of
more
virtues
and
purity
of
heart
.
 
<EOS>
In
our
return
back
,
Madame
de
Rambouliet
desired
me
to
pull
the
cord
.
 
<EOS>
I
asked
her
if
she
wanted
anything
 
Rien
que
pour
pisser
,
said
Madame
de
Rambouliet
.
  
<EOS>
Grieve

no

<EOS>
I
handed
Madame
de
Rambouliet
out
of
the
coach
;
and
had
I
been
the
priest
of
the
chaste
Castalia

What
the
old
French
officer
had
delivered
upon
travelling
,
bringing
Polonius
's
advice
to
his
son
upon
the
same
subject
into
my
head
,
  
and
that
bringing
in
Hamlet
,
and
Hamlet
the
rest
of
Shakespeare

works
,
I
stopp'd
at
the
Quai
de
Conti
in
my
return
home
,
to
purchase
the
whole
set
.
  
<EOS>
The
bookseller
said
he
had
not
a
set
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
Comment

<EOS>
said
I
,
taking
one
up
out
of
a
set
which
lay
upon
the
counter
betwixt
us
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
they
were
sent
him
only
to
be
got
bound
,
and
were
to
be
sent
back
to
Versailles
in
the

And
does
the

said
I
,
read
Shakespeare
?
 
<EOS>
C'est
un
esprit
fort
,
replied
the
bookseller
.
 
<EOS>
He
loves
English
books
!
<EOS>
and
what
is
more
to
his
honour
,
Monsieur
,
he
loves
the
English
too
.
<EOS>
You
speak
this
so
civilly
,
said
I
,
that
it
is
enough
to
oblige
an
Englishman
to
lay
out
a
louis
d'or
or
two
at
your
shop
.
 
<EOS>
The
bookseller
made
a
bow
,
and
was
going
to
say
something
,
when
a
young
decent
girl
about
twenty
,
who
by
her
air
and
dress
seemed
to
be
fille
de
chambre
to
some
devout
woman
of
fashion
,
come
into
the
shop
and
asked
for
Les
Egarements
du
Coeur
et
de
l'Esprit
:
 
<EOS>
the
bookseller
gave
her
the
book
directly
;
she
pulled
out
a
little
green
satin
purse
run
round
with
a
riband
of
the
same
colour
,
and
putting
her
finger
and
thumb
into
it
,
she
took
out
the
money
and
paid
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
had
nothing
more
to
stay
me
in
the
shop
,
we
both
walk'd
out
at
the
door
together
.
     
<EOS>
And
what
have
you
to
do
,
my
dear
,
said
I
,
with
The
Wanderings
of
the
Heart
,
who
scarce
know
yet
you
have
one
?
<EOS>
nor
,
till
love
has
first
told
you
it
,
or
some
faithless
shepherd
has
made
it
ache
<EOS>
,
canst
thou
ever
be
sure
it
is
so
.
 
<EOS>
Le
Dieu
m'en
garde
!
<EOS>
said
the
girl
.
 
<EOS>
With
reason
,
said
I
,
for
if
it
is
a
good
one
,
'
tis
pity
it
should
be
stolen
;
'
tis
a
little
treasure
to
thee
,
and
gives
a
better
air
to
your
face
,
than
if
it
was
dress'd
out
with
pearls
.
  
<EOS>
The
young
girl
listened
with
a
submissive
attention
,
holding
her
satin
purse
by
its
riband
in
her
hand
all
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
a
very
small
one
,
said
I
,
taking
hold
of
the
bottom
of
it
 
<EOS>
she
held
it
towards
me
 
<EOS>
and
there
is
very
little
in
it
,
my
dear
,
said
I
;
but
be
but
as
good
as
thou
art
handsome
,
and
heaven
will
fill
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
a
parcel
of
crowns
in
my
hand
to
pay
for
Shakespeare
;
and
,
as
she
had
let
go
the
purse
entirely
,
I
put
a
single
one
in
;
and
,
tying
up
the
riband
in
a
bow
-
knot
,
returned
it
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
The
young
girl
made
me
more
a
humble
courtesy
than
a
low
one
:
   
'
twas
one
of
those
quiet
,
thankful
sinkings
,
where
the
spirit
bows
itself
down
,
 
<EOS>
the
body
does
no
more
than
tell
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
gave
a
girl
a
crown
in
my
life
which
gave
me
half
the
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
My
advice
,
my
dear
,
would
not
have
been
worth
a
pin
to
you
,
said
I
,
if
I
had
not
given
this
along
with
it
:
 
but
now
,
when
you
see
the
crown
,
you
'll
remember
it
;
 
so
do
n't
,
my
dear
,
lay
it
out
in
ribands
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
,
Sir
,
said
the
girl
,
earnestly
,
I
am
incapable
;
 
in
saying
which
,
as
is
usual
in
little
bargains
of
honour
,
she
gave
me
her
hand
:
  
E
n
verite

Monsieur
<EOS>

je
mettrai
cet

said
she
.
  
<EOS>
When
a
virtuous
convention
is
made
betwixt
man
and
woman

it
sanctifies
their
most
private
walks

so
,
notwithstanding
it
was
dusky
,
yet
as
both
our
roads
lay
the
same
way

we
made
no
scruple
of
walking
along
the
Quai

<EOS>
She
made
me
a
second
courtesy
in
setting
off
,
and
before
we
got
twenty
yards
from
the
door
,
as
if
she
had
not
done
enough
before
,
she
made
a
sort
of
a
little
stop
to
tell
me
again
 
she
<EOS>
thank'd
<EOS>
me
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
small
tribute
,
I
told
her
,
which
I
could
not
avoid
paying
to
virtue
,
and
would
not
be
mistaken
in
the
person
I
had
been
rendering
it
to
for
the
world
;
 
but
I
see
innocence
,
my
dear
,
in
your
face
,
 
and
foul
befall
the
man
who
ever
lays
a
snare
in
its
way
!
  
<EOS>
The
girl
seem'd
affected
some
way
or
other
with
what
I
said
;
 
she
gave
a
low
sigh
:
  
<EOS>
I
 
found
I
was
not
empowered
to
enquire
at
all
after
it
,
 
so
said
nothing
more
till
I
got
to
the
corner
of
the
Rue
de
Nevers
,
where
,
we
were
to
part
.
     
<EOS>
But
is
this
the
way
,
my
dear
,
said
I
,
to
the
Hotel
de
Modene
?
<EOS>
She
told
me
it
was
;
 
or
that
I
might
go
by
the
Rue
de
Gueneguault
,
which
was
the
next
turn
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
'll
go
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
by
the
Rue
de
Gueneguault
,
said
I
,
for
two
reasons
;
first
,
I
shall
please
myself
,
and
next
,
I
shall
give
you
the
protection
of
my
company
as
far
on
your
way
as
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
The
girl
was
sensible
I
was
civil
 
and
said
,
she
wished
the
Hotel
de
Modene
was
in
the
Rue
de
St.
Pierre
.
 
<EOS>
You
live
there
?
<EOS>
said
<EOS>
I.
 
She
told
me
she
was
fille
de
chambre
to
Madame
R
#
#
#
#
.
 
<EOS>
Good
God
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
'
tis
the
very
lady
for
whom
I
have
brought
a
letter
from
Amiens
.
 
<EOS>
The
girl
told
me
that
Madame
R
#
#
#
#
,
she
believed
,
expected
a
stranger
with
a
letter
,
and
was
impatient
to
see
him
:
   
<EOS>
so
I
desired
the
girl
to
present
my
compliments
to
Madame
R
#
#
#
#
,
and
say
,
I
would
certainly
wait
upon
her
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
We
stood
still
at
the
corner
of
the
Rue
de
Nevers
whilst
this
pass'd
.
 
<EOS>
We
then
stopped
a
moment
whilst
she
disposed
of
her
Egarements
du
Coeur
&
c.
more
commodiously
than
carrying
them
in
her
hand
 
they
were
two
volumes
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
held
the
second
for
her
whilst
she
put
the
first
into
her
pocket
;
and
then
she
held
her
pocket
,
and
I
put
in
the
other
after
it
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
sweet
to
feel
by
what
fine
spun
threads
<EOS>
our
affections
are
drawn
together
.
  
<EOS>
We
set
off
afresh
,
and
as
she
took
her
third
step
,
the
girl
put
her
hand
within
my
arm
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
just
bidding
her
,
 
but
<EOS>
she
did
it
of
herself
,
with
that
undeliberating
simplicity
,
which
show'd
<EOS>
it
was
out
of
her
head
that
she
had
never
seen
me
before
.
 
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
felt
the
conviction
of
consanguinity
so
strongly
,
that
I
could
not
help
turning
half
round
to
look
in
her
face
,
and
see
if
I
could
trace
out
any
thing
in
it
of
a
family
likeness
.
 
<EOS>
Tut
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
are
we
not
all
relations
?
  
<EOS>
When
we
arrived
at
the
turning
up
of
the
Rue
de
Gueneguault
,
I
stopp'd
<EOS>
to
bid
her
adieu
for
good
and
all
:
 
the
girl
would
thank
me
again
for
my
company
and
kindness
.
 
<EOS>
She
bid
me
adieu
twice
.
 
<EOS>
I
repeated
it
as
often
;
and
so
cordial
was
the
parting
between
us
,
that
had
it
happened
any
where
else
<EOS>
,
I
'm
not
sure
<EOS>
but
I
should
have
signed
it
with
a
kiss
of
charity
,
as
warm
and
holy
as
an
apostle
.
  
<EOS>
But
in
Paris
,
as
none
kiss
each
other
but
the
men
,
 
I
did
,
what
amounted
to
the
same
thing
        
I
bid
God
bless
her
.

THE
PASSPORT
.
 
<EOS>
PARIS
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
got
home
to
my
hotel
,
La
Fleur
told
me
I
had
been
enquired
after
by
the
Lieutenant
de
Police
.
 
<EOS>
The
deuce
take
it
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
 
I
know
the
reason
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
time
the
reader
should
know
it
,
for
in
the
order
of
things
in
which
it
happened
,
it
was
omitted
:
 
not
that
it
was
out
of
my
head
;
but
that
had
I
told
it
then
it
might
have
been
forgotten
now
;
 
and
now
is
the
time
I
want
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
left
London
with
so
much
precipitation
,
<EOS>
that
it
never
enter'd
<EOS>
my
mind
that
we
were
at
war
with
France
;
and
had
reached
Dover
,
and
looked
through
my
glass
at
the
hills
beyond
Boulogne
,
before
the
idea
presented
itself
;
and
with
this
in
its
train
,
that
there
was
no
getting
there
without
a
passport
.
 
<EOS>
Go
<EOS>
but
to
the
end
of
a
street
,
I
have
a
mortal
aversion
for
returning
back
no
wiser
than
I
set
out
;
and
as
this
was
one
of
the
greatest
efforts
I
had
ever
made
for
knowledge
,
I
could
less
bear
the
thoughts
of
it
:
 
<EOS>
so
hearing
the
Count
de
 
had
hired
the
packet
<EOS>
,
I
begg'd
<EOS>
he
would
take
me
in
his
suite
.
 
<EOS>
The
Count
had
some
little
knowledge
of
me
,
so
made
little
or
no
difficulty
,
 
only
said
,
his
inclination
to
serve
me
could
reach
no
farther
than
Calais
,
as
he
was
to
return
by
way
of
Brussels
to
Paris
;
however
,
when
I
had
once
pass'd
there
,
I
might
get
to
Paris
without
interruption
;
but
that
in
Paris
I
must
make
friends
and
shift
for
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
get
to
Paris
,
Monsieur
le
Count
,
said
I
,
 
<EOS>
and
I
shall
do
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
embark'd
,
and
never
thought
more
of
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
When
La
Fleur
told
me
the
Lieutenant
de
Police
had
been
enquiring
after
me
,
 
the
thing
instantly
recurred
;
 
and
by
the
time
La
Fleur
had
well
told
me
,
the
master
of
the
hotel
came
into
my
room
to
tell
me
the
same
thing
,
with
this
addition
to
it
,
that
my
passport
had
been
particularly
asked
after
:
 
the
master
of
the
hotel
concluded
with
saying
,
<EOS>
He
hoped
I
had
one
.
 
<EOS>
Not
I
,
faith
!
said
I.
  
<EOS>
The
master
of
the
hotel
retired
three
steps
from
me
,
as
from
an
infected
person
,
as
I
declared
this
;
 
and
poor
La
Fleur
advanced
three
steps
towards
me
,
and
with
that
sort
of
movement
which
a
good
soul
makes
to
succour
a
distress'd
one
:
  
<EOS>
t
he
fellow
won
my
heart
by
it
;
and
from
that
single
trait
I
knew
his
character
as
perfectly
,
and
could
rely
upon
it
as
firmly
,
as
if
he
had
served
me
with
fidelity
for
seven
years
.
  
<EOS>
Mon
seigneur
!
<EOS>
cried
the
master
of
the
hotel
;
but
recollecting
himself
as
he
made
the
exclamation
,
he
instantly
changed
the
tone
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
Monsieur
,
said
he
,
has
not
a
passport
(
apparemment
)
in
all
likelihood
he
has
friends
in
Paris
who
can
procure
him
one
.
  
<EOS>
Not
that
I
know
of
,
quoth
<EOS>
I
,
with
an
air
of
indifference
.
 
<EOS>
Then
certes
,
replied
he
,
you
'll
be
sent
to
the
Bastile
or
the
Chatelet
au
moins
.
 
<EOS>
Poo
!
said
I
,
the
King
of
France
is
a
good
natur'd
soul
:
  
h
e'll
hurt
nobody
.
 
<EOS>
Cela
n'empeche
pas
,
said
he
 
<EOS>
you
will
certainly
be
sent
to
the
Bastile
to
-
morrow
morning
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
've
taken
your
lodgings
for
a
month
,
<EOS>
answer'd
I
,
and
I
'll
not
quit
them
a
day
before
the
time
for
all
the
kings
of
France
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
La
Fleur
whispered
in
my
ear
,
That
nobody
could
oppose
the
king
of
France
.
  
<EOS>
Pardi
!
<EOS>
said
my
host
,
ces
Messieurs
Anglois
sont
<EOS>
des
gens
tres
extraordinaires
;
 
and
,
having
both
said
and
sworn
it
<EOS>
,
 
he
went
out
.
  
<EOS>
THE
PASSPORT
.
 
<EOS>
THE
HOTEL
AT
PARIS
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
find
in
my
heart
to
torture
La
Fleur
's
with
a
serious
look
upon
the
subject
of
my
embarrassment
,
which
was
the
reason
I
had
treated
it
so
cavalierly
:
 
and
to
show
him
how
light
it
lay
upon
my
mind
<EOS>
,
I
dropt
the
subject
entirely
;
and
whilst
he
waited
upon
me
at
supper
,
talk'd
<EOS>
to
him
with
more
than
usual
gaiety
about
Paris
,
and
of
the
Opera
Comique
.
 
<EOS>
La
Fleur
had
been
there
himself
,
and
had
followed
me
through
the
streets
as
far
as
the
bookseller
's
shop
;
but
seeing
me
come
out
with
the
young
fille
de
chambre
,
and
that
we
walk'd
down
the
Quai
de
Conti
together
,
<EOS>
La
Fleur
<EOS>
deem'd
<EOS>
it
unnecessary
to
follow
me
a
step
further
;
 
so
making
his
own
reflections
upon
it
,
he
took
a
shorter
cut
,
 
and
got
to
the
hotel
in
time
to
be
inform'd
of
the
affair
of
the
police
against
my
arrival
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
honest
creature
had
taken
away
,
and
gone
down
to
sup
himself
,
I
then
began
to
think
a
little
seriously
about
my
situation
.
        
<EOS>
And
here
,
I
know
,
Eugenius
,
thou
wilt
smile
at
the
remembrance
of
a
short
dialogue
which
passed
betwixt
us
the
moment
I
was
going
to
set
out
:
  
<EOS>
I
 
must
tell
it
here
.
  
<EOS>
Eugenius
,
<EOS>
knowing
that
I
was
as
little
subject
to
be
overburden'd
with
money
as
thought
,
had
drawn
me
aside
to
interrogate
me
how
much
I
had
taken
care
for
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
telling
him
the
exact
sum
,
Eugenius
shook
his
head
,
and
said
it
would
not
do
;
so
pull'd
out
his
purse
in
order
to
empty
it
into
mine
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
enough
in
conscience
,
Eugenius
,
said
I.
 
Indeed
,
Yorick
,
you
have
not
,
replied
Eugenius
;
I
know
France
and
Italy
better
than
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
do
n't
consider
,
Eugenius
,
said
I
,
refusing
his
offer
,
that
before
I
have
been
three
days
in
Paris
,
I
shall
take
care
to
say
or
do
something
or
other
for
which
I
shall
get
clapp'd
up
into
the
Bastile
,
and
that
I
shall
live
there
a
couple
of
months
entirely
at
the
king
of
France
's
expense
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
pardon
,
said
Eugenius
drily
:
<EOS>
really
I
had
forgot
that
resource
.
  
<EOS>
Now
the
event
I
treated
gaily
came
seriously
to
my
door
.
  
<EOS>
Is
it
folly
,
or
nonchalance
,
or
philosophy
,
or
pertinacity
 
or
what
is
it
in
me
,
that
,
after
all
,
when
La
Fleur
had
gone
down
stairs
,
and
I
was
quite
alone
,
I
could
not
bring
down
my
mind
to
think
of
it
otherwise
than
I
had
then
spoken
of
it
to
Eugenius
?
     
<EOS>
And
as
for
the
Bastile
;
the
terror
is
in
the
word
.
 
<EOS>
Make
the
most
of
it
<EOS>
you
can
,
said
I
to
myself
,
the
Bastile
is
but
another
word
for
a
tower
;
 
and
a
tower
is
but
another
word
for
a
house
you
ca
n't
get
out
of
.
 
<EOS>
Mercy
on
the
gouty
!
<EOS>
for
they
are
in
it
twice
a
year
.
  
<EOS>
But
with
nine
livres
a
day
,
and
pen
and
ink
,
and
paper
,
and
patience
,
albeit
a
man
ca
n't
get
out
,
he
may
do
very
well
within
,
  
at
least
for
a
mouth
or
six
weeks
;
at
the
end
of
which
,
if
he
is
a
harmless
fellow
,
his
innocence
appears
,
and
he
comes
out
a
better
and
wiser
man
than
he
went
in
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
some
occasion
(
I
forget
what
)
to
step
into
the
court
-
yard
,
as
I
settled
this
account
;
and
remember
I
walk'd
down
stairs
in
no
small
triumph
with
the
conceit
of
my
reasoning
.
 
<EOS>
Beshrew
the
sombre
pencil
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
vauntingly
 
for
I
envy
not
its
powers
,
which
paints
the
evils
of
life
with
so
hard
and
deadly
a
colouring
.
 
<EOS>
The
mind
sits
terrified
at
the
objects
she
has
magnified
herself
,
and
blackened
:
 
<EOS>
reduce
them
to
their
proper
size
and
hue
,
she
overlooks
them
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
true
,
said
I
,
correcting
the
proposition
,
 
the
Bastile
is
not
an
evil
to
be
despised
;
 
but
strip
it
of
its
towers
 
<EOS>
fill
up
the
fosse
,
 
unbarricade
the
doors
 
call
it
simply
a
confinement
,
and
suppose
'
tis
some
tyrant
of
a
distemper
 
and
not
of
a
man
,
which
holds
you
in
it
,
 
the
evil
vanishes
,
and
you
bear
the
other
half
without
complaint
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
interrupted
in
the
heyday
of
this
soliloquy
,
with
a
voice
which
I
took
to
be
of
a
child
,
which
complained
"
it
could
not
get
out
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
look'd
up
and
down
the
passage
,
and
seeing
neither
man
,
woman
,
nor
child
,
I
went
out
without
farther
attention
.
  
<EOS>
In
my
return
back
through
the
passage
,
I
heard
the
same
words
repeated
twice
over
;
and
,
looking
up
,
I
saw
it
was
a
starling
hung
in
a
little
cage
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
get
out
,
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
get
out
,
"
said
the
starling
.
  
<EOS>
I
stood
looking
at
the
bird
:
 
and
to
every
person
who
came
through
the
passage
it
ran
fluttering
to
the
side
towards
which
<EOS>
they
<EOS>
approach'd
it
,
with
the
same
lamentation
of
its
captivity
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
get
out
,
"
said
the
starling
.
 
<EOS>
God
help
thee
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
but
I
'll
let
thee
out
,
cost
what
it
will
;
so
I
turned
about
the
cage
to
get
to
the
door
:
 
it
was
twisted
and
double
twisted
so
fast
with
wire
<EOS>
,
there
was
no
getting
it
open
without
pulling
the
cage
to
pieces
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
both
hands
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
bird
flew
to
the
place
where
I
was
attempting
his
deliverance
,
and
thrusting
his
head
through
the
trellis
pressed
his
breast
against
it
as
if
impatient
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
,
poor
creature
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
I
can
not
set
thee
at
liberty
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
the
starling
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
get
out
 
I
ca
n't
get
out
,
"
said
the
starling
.
  
<EOS>
I
vow
<EOS>
I
never
had
my
affections
more
tenderly
awakened
;
nor
do
I
remember
an
incident
in
my
life
,
where
the
dissipated
spirits
,
to
which
my
reason
had
been
a
bubble
,
were
so
suddenly
call'd
home
.
<EOS>
Mechanical
as
the
notes
were
,
yet
so
true
in
tune
to
nature
were
they
chanted
,
that
in
one
moment
they
overthrew
all
my
systematic
reasonings
upon
the
Bastile
;
and
I
heavily
walked
upstairs
,
unsaying
every
word
I
had
said
in
going
down
them
.
  
<EOS>
Disguise
thyself
as
thou
wilt
,
still
,
Slavery
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
 
still
thou
art
a
bitter
draught
!
<EOS>
and
though
thousands
in
all
ages
have
been
made
to
drink
of
thee
,
thou
art
no
less
bitter
on
that
account
.
  
<EOS>
'
Tis
thou
,
thrice
sweet
and
gracious
goddess
,
addressing
myself
to
Liberty
,
whom
all
in
public
or
in
private
worship
,
whose
taste
is
grateful
,
and
ever
will
be
so
,
till
Nature
herself
shall
change
.
  
<EOS>
No
TINT
of
words
can
spot
thy
snowy
mantle
,
or
chymic
power
turn
thy
sceptre
into
iron
:
  
<EOS>
w
ith
thee
to
smile
upon
him
as
he
eats
his
crust
<EOS>
,
the
swain
is
happier
than
his
monarch
,
from
whose
court
thou
art
exiled
!
 
<EOS>
Gracious
Heaven
!
<EOS>
cried
I
,
kneeling
down
upon
the
last
step
but
one
in
my
ascent
,
grant
me
but
health
,
thou
great
Bestower
of
it
,
and
give
me
<EOS>
but
this
fair
goddess
as
my
companion
,
 
and
shower
down
thy
mitres
,
if
it
seems
good
unto
thy
divine
providence
,
upon
those
heads
which
are
aching
for
them
!
  
<EOS>
THE
CAPTIVE
.
 
<EOS>
PARIS
.
  
<EOS>
The
bird
in
his
cage
pursued
me
into
my
room
;
I
sat
down
close
to
my
table
,
and
leaning
my
head
upon
my
hand
,
I
began
to
figure
to
myself
the
miseries
of
confinement
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
in
a
right
frame
for
it
,
and
so
I
gave
full
scope
to
my
imagination
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
going
to
begin
with
the
millions
of
my
fellow
-
creatures
born
to
no
inheritance
but
slavery
:
 
but
finding
,
however
affecting
the
picture
was
,
that
I
could
not
bring
it
near
me
,
and
that
the
multitude
of
sad
groups
in
it
did
but
distract
me
.
        
<EOS>
I
took
a
single
captive
,
and
having
first
shut
him
up
in
his
dungeon
,
I
then
look'd
<EOS>
through
the
twilight
of
his
grated
door
to
take
his
picture
.
  
<EOS>
I
beheld
his
body
half
-
wasted
away
with
long
expectation
and
confinement
,
and
felt
what
kind
of
sickness
of
the
heart
it
was
which
arises
from
hope
<EOS>
deferr'd
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
looking
nearer
I
saw
him
pale
and
feverish
:
 
<EOS>
in
thirty
years
the
western
breeze
had
not
once
fann'd
<EOS>
his
blood
;
 
<EOS>
he
had
seen
no
sun
,
no
moon
,
in
all
that
time
 
nor
had
the
voice
of
friend
or
kinsman
breathed
through
his
lattice
.
 
<EOS>
His
children
     
<EOS>
But
here
my
heart
began
to
bleed
 
<EOS>
and
I
was
forced
to
go
on
with
another
part
of
the
portrait
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
sitting
upon
the
ground
upon
a
little
straw
,
in
the
furthest
corner
of
his
dungeon
,
which
was
alternately
his
chair
and
bed
:
 
a
little
calendar
of
small
sticks
were
laid
at
the
head
,
notch'd
all
over
with
the
dismal
days
and
nights
he
had
passed
there
;
 
<EOS>
he
had
one
of
these
little
sticks
in
his
hand
,
and
,
with
a
rusty
nail
he
was
etching
another
day
of
misery
to
add
to
the
heap
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
darkened
the
little
light
he
had
,
he
lifted
up
a
hopeless
eye
towards
the
door
,
then
cast
it
down
,
 
shook
his
head
,
and
went
on
with
his
work
of
affliction
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
his
chains
upon
his
legs
,
as
he
turned
his
body
to
lay
his
little
stick
upon
the
bundle
.
 
<EOS>
He
gave
a
deep
sigh
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
the
iron
enter
into
his
soul
!
 
<EOS>
I
burst
into
tears
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
sustain
the
picture
of
confinement
which
my
fancy
had
drawn
.
 
<EOS>
I
started
up
from
my
chair
,
and
calling
La
Fleur
:
 
<EOS>
I
bid
him
bespeak
me
a
remise
,
and
have
it
ready
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
by
nine
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
I
'll
go
directly
,
said
I
,
myself
to
Monsieur
le
Duc
de
Choiseul
.
  
<EOS>
La
Fleur
would
have
put
me
to
bed
;
but
 
not
willing
he
should
see
anything
upon
my
cheek
which
would
cost
the
honest
fellow
a
heart
-
ache
,
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
I
would
go
to
bed
by
myself
,
 
and
bid
him
go
<EOS>
do
the
same
.
  
<EOS>
THE
STARLING
.
 
<EOS>
ROAD
TO
VERSAILLES
.
  
<EOS>
I
got
into
my
remise
the
hour
I
proposed
:
 
<EOS>
La
Fleur
got
up
behind
,
and
I
bid
the
coachman
make
the
best
of
his
way
to
Versailles
.
  
<EOS>
As
there
was
nothing
in
this
road
,
or
rather
nothing
which
I
look
for
in
travelling
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
fill
up
the
blank
better
than
with
a
short
history
of
this
self
-
same
bird
,
which
became
the
subject
of
the
last
chapter
.
  
<EOS>
Whilst
<EOS>
the
Honourable
<EOS>
Mr.
 
was
waiting
for
a
wind
at
Dover
,
it
had
been
caught
upon
the
cliffs
,
before
it
could
well
fly
,
by
an
English
lad
who
was
his
groom
;
who
,
not
caring
to
destroy
it
,
had
taken
it
in
his
breast
into
the
packet
;
 
and
,
by
course
of
feeding
it
,
and
taking
it
once
under
his
protection
,
in
a
day
or
two
grew
fond
of
it
,
and
got
it
safe
along
with
him
to
Paris
.
  
<EOS>
At
Paris
the
lad
had
laid
out
a
livre
in
a
little
cage
for
the
starling
,
and
as
he
had
little
to
do
better
the
five
months
his
master
staid
there
,
he
taught
it
,
in
his
mother
's
tongue
,
the
four
simple
words
(
and
no
more
)
 
to
which
I
own'd
myself
so
much
its
debtor
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
his
master
's
going
on
for
Italy
,
the
lad
had
given
it
to
the
master
of
the
hotel
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
little
song
for
liberty
being
in
an
UNKNOWN
language
at
Paris
,
the
bird
had
little
or
no
store
set
by
him
:
 
<EOS>
so
La
Fleur
bought
both
him
and
his
cage
for
me
for
a
bottle
of
Burgundy
.
  
<EOS>
In
my
return
from
Italy
I
brought
him
with
me
to
the
country
in
whose
language
he
had
learned
his
notes
;
and
telling
the
story
of
him
to
Lord
A
#
#
#
#
,
Lord
A
#
#
#
#
begg'd
the
bird
of
me
;
 
in
a
week
Lord
A
#
#
#
#
gave
him
to
Lord
B
#
#
#
#
;
Lord
B
#
#
#
#
made
a
present
of
him
to
Lord
C
#
#
#
#
;
and
Lord
C
#
#
#
#
's
gentleman
sold
him
to
Lord
D
#
#
#
#
's
for
a
shilling
;
Lord
D
#
#
#
#
gave
him
to
Lord
E
#
#
#
#
;
and
so
on
 
half
round
the
alphabet
.
 
<EOS>
From
that
rank
he
pass'd
into
the
lower
house
,
and
pass'd
the
hands
of
as
many
commoners
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
all
these
wanted
to
GET
IN
,
and
my
bird
wanted
to
GET
OUT
,
he
had
almost
as
little
store
set
by
him
in
London
as
in
Paris
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
but
many
of
my
readers
must
have
heard
of
him
;
and
if
any
by
mere
chance
have
ever
seen
him
,
I
beg
leave
to
inform
them
,
that
that
bird
was
my
bird
,
or
some
vile
copy
set
up
to
represent
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
farther
to
add
upon
him
,
but
that
from
that
time
to
this
I
have
borne
this
poor
starling
as
the
crest
to
my
arms
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
<EOS>
:
  
[
Picture

And
let
the
herald
's
officers
twist
his
neck
about

they
dare
.
  
<EOS>
THE
ADDRESS
.
 
<EOS>
VERSAILLES
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
not
like
to
have
my
enemy
take
a
view
of
my
mind
when
I
am
going
to
ask
protection
of
any
man
;
for
which
reason
I
generally
endeavour
to
protect
myself
;
but
this
going
to
Monsieur
le
Duc
de
C
#
#
#
#
was
an
act
of
compulsion
;
had
it
been
an
act
of
choice
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
done
it
,
I
suppose
,
like
other
people
.
  
<EOS>
How
many
mean
plans
of
dirty
address
,
as
I
went
along
,
did
my
servile
heart
form
!
 
<EOS>
I
deserved
the
Bastile
for
every
one
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
Then
nothing
would
serve
me
when
I
got
within
sight
of
Versailles
,
but
putting
words
and
sentences
together
,
and
conceiving
attitudes
and
tones
to
wreath
myself
into
Monsieur
le
Duc
de
C
#
#
#
#
's
good
graces
.
 
<EOS>
This
will
do
,
said
I.
 
Just
as
well
,
retorted
I
again
,
as
a
coat
carried
up
to
him
by
an
adventurous
tailor
,
without
taking
his
measure
.
 
<EOS>
Fool
!
<EOS>
continued
I
,
 
see
Monsieur
le
Duc
's
face
first
;
 
observe
what
character
is
written
in
it
;
 
take
notice
in
what
posture
he
stands
to
hear
you
;
 
mark
the
turns
and
expressions
of
his
body
and
limbs
;
 
and
for
the
tone
,
 
the
first
sound
which
comes
from
his
lips
will
give
it
you
;
and
from
all
these
together
you
'll
compound
an
address
at
once
upon
the
spot
,
which
can
not
disgust
the
Duke
;
 
the
ingredients
are
his
own
,
and
most
likely
to
go
down
.
  
<EOS>
Well
!
said
I
,
I
wish
it
well
over
.
 
<EOS>
Coward
again
!
<EOS>
as
if
man
to
man
was
not
equal
throughout
the
whole
surface
of
the
globe
;
and
if
in
the
field
 
why
not
face
to
face
in
the
cabinet
too
?
 
<EOS>
And
trust
me
,
Yorick
,
whenever
it
is
not
so
,
man
is
false
to
himself
and
betrays
his
own
succours
ten
times
where
nature
does
it
once
.
 
<EOS>
Go
to
the
Duc
de
C
#
#
#
#
with
the
Bastile
in
thy
looks
;
 
my
life
for
it
,
thou
wilt
be
sent
back
to
Paris
in
half
an
hour
with
an
escort
.
  
<EOS>
I
believe
so
,
said
I.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
'll
go
to
the
Duke
,
by
heaven
!
<EOS>
with
all
the
gaiety
and
debonairness
in
the
world
.
        
<EOS>
And
there
you
are
wrong
again
,
replied
<EOS>
I.
 
A
heart
at
ease
,
Yorick
,
flies
into
no
extremes
 
'
tis
ever
on
its
centre
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
cried
I
,
as
the
coachman
turn'd
<EOS>
in
at
the
gates
,
I
find
I
shall
do
very
well
:
 
and
by
the
time
he
had
wheel'd
round
the
court
,
and
brought
me
up
to
the
door
,
I
found
myself
so
much
the
better
for
my
own
lecture
,
that
I
neither
ascended
the
steps
like
a
victim
to
justice
,
who
was
to
part
with
life
upon
the
top
most
,
  
nor
did
I
mount
them
with
a
skip
and
a
couple
of
strides
,
as
I
do
when
I
fly
up
,
Eliza
!
<EOS>
to
thee
to
meet
it
.
  
<EOS>
As
I
entered
the
door
of
the
saloon
I
was
met
by
a
person
,
who
possibly
might
be
the
maitre
d'hotel
,
but
had
more
the
air
of
one
of
the
under
secretaries
,
who
told
me
the
Duc
de
C
#
#
#
#
was
busy
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
utterly
ignorant
,
said
I
,
of
the
forms
of
obtaining
an
audience
,
being
an
absolute
stranger
,
and
what
is
worse
in
the
present
conjuncture
of
affairs
,
being
an
Englishman
too
.
 
<EOS>
He
replied
,
that
did
not
increase
the
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
him
a
slight
bow
,
and
told
him
,
I
had
something
of
importance
to
say
to
Monsieur
le
Duc
.
 
<EOS>
The
secretary
look'd
<EOS>
towards
the
stairs
,
as
if
he
was
about
to
leave
me
to
carry
up
this
account
to
some
one
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
must
not
mislead
you
,
said
I
,
 
for
what
I
have
to
say
is
of
no
manner
of
importance
to
Monsieur
le
Duc
de
C
<EOS>
#
#
#
#
but
of
great
importance
to
myself
.
 
<EOS>
C'est
<EOS>
une
autre
affaire
,
replied
he
.
 
<EOS>
Not
at
all
,
said
I
,
to
a
man
of
gallantry
.
 
<EOS>
But
pray
,
good
sir
,
continued
I
,
when
can
a
stranger
hope
to
have
access
?
 
<EOS>
In
not
less
than
two
hours
,
said
he
,
looking
at
his
watch
.
 
<EOS>
The
number
of
equipages
in
the
court
-
yard
seemed
to
justify
the
calculation
,
that
I
could
have
no
nearer
a
prospect
;
  
and
as
walking
backwards
and
forwards
in
the
saloon
,
without
a
soul
to
commune
with
,
was
for
the
time
as
bad
as
being
in
the
Bastile
itself
,
I
instantly
went
back
to
my
remise
,
and
bid
the
coachman
drive
me
to
the
Cordon
Bleu
,
which
was
the
nearest
hotel
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
there
is
a
fatality
in
it
;
 
I
seldom
go
to
the
place
I
set
out
for
.

<EOS>
Before
I
had
got
half
way
down
the
street
<EOS>
I
changed
my
mind
:
 
as
I
am
at
Versailles
,
thought
I
,
I
might
as
well
take
a
view
of
the
town
;
<EOS>
so
I
pull'd
<EOS>
the
cord
,
and
ordered
the
coachman
to
drive
round
some
of
the
principal
streets
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
town
is
not
very
large
,
said
I.
 
The
coachman
begg'd
pardon
for
setting
me
right
,
and
told
me
it
was
very
superb
,
and
that
numbers
of
the
first
dukes
and
marquises
and
counts
had
hotels
.
 
<EOS>
The
Count
de
B
#
#
#
#
,
of
whom
the
bookseller
at
the
Quai
de
Conti
had
spoke
so
handsomely
the
night
before
,
came
instantly
into
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
And
why
should
I
not
go
,
<EOS>
thought
I
,
to
the
Count
de
B
#
#
#
#
,
who
has
so
high
an
idea
of
English
books
and
English
men
 
and
tell
him
my
story
?
<EOS>
so
I
changed
my
mind
a
second
time
.
 
<EOS>
In
truth
it
was
the
third
;
for
I
had
intended
that
day
for
Madame
de
R
#
#
#
#
,
in
the
Rue
St.
Pierre
,
and
had
devoutly
sent
her
word
by
her
fille
de
chambre
that
I
would
assuredly
wait
upon
her
;
 
but
I
am
governed
by
circumstances
;
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
govern
them
:
<EOS>
so
seeing
a
man
standing
with
a
basket
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
,
as
if
he
had
something
to
sell
,
I
bid
La
Fleur
go
up
to
him
,
and
enquire
for
the
Count
's
hotel
.
  
<EOS>
La
Fleur
returned
a
little
pale
;
and
told
me
it
was
a
Chevalier
de
St.
Louis
selling
pates
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
,
La
Fleur
,
said
I.
 
La
Fleur
could
no
more
account
for
the
phenomenon
than
myself
;
but
persisted
in
his
story
:
 
he
had
seen
the
croix
set
in
gold
,
with
its
red
riband
,
he
said
,
tied
to
his
buttonhole
 
and
had
looked
into
the
basket
and
seen
the
pates
which
the
Chevalier
was
selling
;
so
could
not
be
mistaken
in
that
.
  
<EOS>
Such
a
reverse
in
man
's
life
awakens
a
better
principle
than
curiosity
:
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
looking
for
some
time
at
him
as
I
sat
in
the
remise
:
  
<EOS>
t
he
more
<EOS>
I
look'd
<EOS>
at
him
,
his
croix
,
and
his
basket
,
the
stronger
they
wove
themselves
into
my
brain
.
 
<EOS>
I
got
out
of
the
remise
,
and
went
towards
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
begirt
with
a
clean
linen
apron
which
fell
below
his
knees
,
and
with
a
sort
of
a
bib
that
went
half
way
up
his
breast
;
upon
the
top
of
this
,
but
a
little
below
the
hem
,
hung
his
croix
.
 
<EOS>
His
basket
of
little
pates
was
covered
over
with
a
white
damask
napkin
;
another
of
the
same
kind
was
spread
at
the
bottom
;
and
there
was
a
look
of
proprete
and
neatness
throughout
,
that
one
might
have
bought
his
pates
of
him
,
as
much
from
appetite
as
sentiment
.
  
<EOS>
He
made
an
offer
of
them
to
neither
;
but
stood
still
with
them
at
the
corner
of
an
hotel
,
for
those
to
buy
who
chose
it
without
solicitation
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
about
forty
-
eight
;
 
of
a
sedate
look
,
something
approaching
to
gravity
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
up
rather
to
the
basket
than
him
,
and
having
lifted
up
the
napkin
,
and
taking
one
of
his
pates
into
my
hand
,
 
<EOS>
I
begg'd
<EOS>
he
would
explain
the
appearance
which
affected
me
.
  
<EOS>
He
told
me
in
a
few
words
,
that
the
best
part
of
his
life
had
passed
in
the
service
,
in
which
,
after
spending
a
small
patrimony
,
he
had
obtained
a
company
and
the
croix
with
it
;
but
that
,
at
the
conclusion
of
the
last
peace
,
his
regiment
being
reformed
,
and
the
whole
corps
,
with
those
of
some
other
regiments
,
left
without
any
provision
,
he
found
himself
in
a
wide
world
without
friends
,
without
a
livre
,
 
and
indeed
,
said
he
,
without
anything
but
this
,
  
(
pointing
,
as
he
said
it
,
to
his
croix
)
.
 
<EOS>
The
poor
Chevalier
won
my
pity
,
and
he
finished
the
scene
with
winning
my
esteem
too
.
  
<EOS>
The
king
,
he
said
,
was
the
most
generous
of
princes
,
but
his
generosity
could
neither
relieve
nor
reward
everyone
,
and
it
was
only
his
misfortune
to
be
amongst
the
number
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
little
wife
,
he
said
,
whom
he
loved
,
who
did
the
patisserie
;
and
added
,
he
felt
no
dishonour
in
defending
her
and
himself
from
want
in
this
way
 
unless
Providence
had
offer'd
<EOS>
him
a
better
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
be
wicked
to
withhold
a
pleasure
from
the
good
,
in
passing
over
what
happen'd
<EOS>
to
this
poor
Chevalier
of
St.
Louis
about
nine
months
after
.
  
<EOS>
It
seems
he
usually
took
his
stand
near
the
iron
gates
which
lead
up
to
the
palace
,
and
as
his
croix
had
caught
the
eyes
of
numbers
,
numbers
had
made
the
same
enquiry
which
I
had
done
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
told
them
the
same
story
,
and
always
with
so
much
modesty
and
good
sense
,
that
it
had
reach'd
<EOS>
at
last
the
king
's
ears
;
 
<EOS>
who
,
hearing
the
Chevalier
had
been
a
gallant
officer
,
and
respected
by
the
whole
regiment
as
a
man
of
honour
and
integrity
,
 
he
broke
up
his
little
trade
by
a
pension
of
fifteen
hundred
livres
a
year
.
  
<EOS>
As
I
have
told
this
to
please
the
reader
,
I
beg
he
will
allow
me
to
relate
another
,
out
of
its
order
,
to
please
myself
:
  
<EOS>
t
he
two
stories
reflect
light
upon
each
other
,
 
and
'
tis
a
pity
they
should
be
parted
.
  
<EOS>
THE
SWORD
.
 
<EOS>
RENNES
.
  
<EOS>
When
states
and
empires
have
their
periods
of
declension
,
and
feel
in
their
turns
what
distress
and
poverty
is
,
 
I
stop
not
to
tell
the
causes
which
gradually
brought
the
house
d'E
#
#
#
#
,
in
Brittany
,
into
decay
.
 
<EOS>
The
Marquis
d'E
<EOS>
#
#
#
#
had
fought
up
against
his
condition
with
great
firmness
;
wishing
to
preserve
,
and
still
show
to
the
world
,
some
little
fragments
of
what
his
ancestors
had
been
;
 
their
indiscretions
had
put
it
out
of
his
power
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
enough
left
for
the
little
exigencies
of
OBSCURITY
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
had
two
boys
who
looked
up
to
him
for
LIGHT
;
 
<EOS>
he
thought
they
deserved
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
tried
his
sword
 
it
could
not
open
the
way
,
 
the
MOUNTING
was
too
expensive
,
 
and
simple
economy
was
not
a
match
for
it
:
  
<EOS>
t
here
was
no
resource
but
commerce
.
  
<EOS>
In
any
other
province
in
France
,
save
Brittany
,
this
was
smiting
the
root
for
ever
of
the
little
tree
his
pride
and
affection
wish'd
to
see
re
-
blossom
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
Brittany
,
there
being
a
provision
for
this
,
he
avail'd
<EOS>
himself
of
it
;
and
,
taking
an
occasion
when
the
states
were
assembled
at
Rennes
,
the
Marquis
,
attended
with
his
two
boys
,
entered
the
court
;
and
having
pleaded
the
right
of
an
ancient
law
of
the
duchy
,
which
,
though
seldom
claim'd
,
he
said
,
was
no
less
in
force
<EOS>
,
he
took
his
sword
from
his
side
:
  
H
ere
,
said
he
,
take
it
;
and
be
trusty
guardians
of
it
,
till
better
times
put
me
in
condition
to
reclaim
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
president
accepted
the
Marquis
's
sword
:
 
<EOS>
he
staid
a
few
minutes
to
see
it
deposited
in
the
archives
of
his
house
 
and
departed
.
  
<EOS>
The
Marquis
and
his
whole
family
embarked
the
next
clay
for
Martinico
,
and
in
about
nineteen
or
twenty
years
of
successful
application
to
business
,
with
some
unlook'd
<EOS>
for
bequests
from
distant
branches
of
his
house
,
return
home
to
reclaim
his
nobility
,
and
to
support
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
an
incident
of
good
fortune
which
will
never
happen
to
any
traveller
but
a
Sentimental
one
,
that
I
should
be
at
Rennes
at
the
very
time
of
this
solemn
requisition
:
 
<EOS>
I
call
it
solemn
;
 
it
was
so
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
The
Marquis
entered
the
court
with
his
whole
family
:
 
<EOS>
he
supported
his
lady
,
 
his
eldest
son
supported
his
sister
,
and
his
youngest
was
at
the
other
extreme
of
the
line
next
his
mother
;
 
he
put
his
handkerchief
to
his
face
twice
.
        
<EOS>
There
was
a
dead
silence
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
Marquis
had
approached
within
six
paces
of
the
tribunal
,
he
gave
the
Marchioness
to
his
youngest
son
,
and
advancing
three
steps
before
his
family
,
 
he
reclaim'd
<EOS>
his
sword
.
 
<EOS>
His
sword
was
given
him
,
and
the
moment
he
got
it
into
his
hand
he
drew
it
almost
out
of
the
scabbard
:
  
'
twas
the
shining
face
of
a
friend
he
had
once
given
up
 
he
look'd
<EOS>
attentively
along
it
,
beginning
at
the
hilt
,
as
if
to
see
whether
it
was
the
same
,
  
when
,
observing
a
little
rust
which
it
had
contracted
near
the
point
,
he
brought
it
near
his
eye
,
and
bending
his
head
down
over
it
,
 
<EOS>
I
think
 
I
saw
a
tear
fall
upon
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
be
deceived
by
what
followed
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
find
,
"
said
he
,
"
some
OTHER
WAY
to
get
it
off
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
the
Marquis
had
said
this
,
he
returned
his
sword
into
its
scabbard
,
made
a
bow
to
the
guardians
of
it
,
 
and
,
with
his
wife
and
daughter
,
and
his
two
sons
following
him
,
<EOS>
walk'd
out
.
  
<EOS>
O
,
how
I
envied
him
his
feelings
!
  
<EOS>
THE
PASSPORT
.
 
<EOS>
VERSAILLES
.
  
<EOS>
I
found
no
difficulty
in
getting
admittance
to
Monsieur
le
Count
de
B
#
#
#
#
.
 
<EOS>
The
set
of
Shakespeares
was
laid
upon
the
table
,
and
he
was
tumbling
them
over
.
 
<EOS>
I
walk'd
up
close
to
the
table
,
and
giving
first
such
a
look
at
the
books
as
to
make
him
conceive
<EOS>
I
knew
what
they
were
<EOS>
,
 
I
told
him
I
had
come
without
any
one
to
present
me
,
knowing
I
should
meet
with
a
friend
in
his
apartment
,
who
,
I
trusted
,
would
do
it
for
me
:
  
<EOS>
i
t
is
my
countryman
,
the
great
Shakespeare
,
said
I
,
pointing
to
his
works
 
<EOS>
et
<EOS>
ayez
<EOS>
la
boute
,
mon
cher
ami
,
apostrophizing
his
spirit
,
added
I
,
de
me
<EOS>
faire
cet
honneur
-
la
.
     
<EOS>
The
Count
smiled
at
the
singularity
of
the
introduction
;
and
seeing
I
look'd
<EOS>
a
little
pale
and
sickly
,
insisted
upon
my
taking
an
arm
-
chair
;
so
I
sat
down
;
and
to
save
him
conjectures
upon
a
visit
so
out
of
all
rule
,
I
told
him
simply
of
the
incident
in
the
bookseller
's
shop
,
and
how
that
had
impelled
me
rather
to
go
to
him
with
the
story
of
a
little
embarrassment
I
was
under
,
than
to
any
other
man
in
France
.
 
<EOS>
And
what
is
your
embarrassment
?
<EOS>
let
me
hear
it
,
said
the
Count
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
told
him
the
story
just
as
I
have
told
it
the
reader
.
     
<EOS>
And
the
master
of
my
hotel
,
said
I
,
as
I
concluded
it
,
will
needs
have
it
,
Monsieur
le
Count
,
that
I
shall
be
sent
to
the
Bastile
;
  
but
I
have
no
apprehensions
,
continued
I
;
 
for
,
in
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
most
polish'd
people
in
the
world
,
and
being
conscious
<EOS>
I
was
a
true
man
,
and
not
come
to
spy
the
nakedness
of
the
land
<EOS>
,
I
scarce
thought
I
lay
at
their
mercy
.
 
<EOS>
It
does
not
suit
the
gallantry
of
the
French
,
Monsieur
le
Count
,
said
I
,
to
show
it
against
invalids
.
  
<EOS>
An
animated
blush
came
into
the
Count
de
B
#
#
#
#
's
cheeks
as
I
spoke
this
.
 
<EOS>
Ne
craignez
rien
 
Do
n't
fear
,
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
do
n't
,
replied
I
again
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
continued
I
,
a
little
sportingly
,
I
have
come
laughing
all
the
way
from
London
to
Paris
,
and
I
do
not
think
Monsieur
le
Duc
de
Choiseul
is
such
an
enemy
to
mirth
as
to
send
me
back
crying
for
my
pains
.
     
<EOS>
My
application
to
you
,
Monsieur
le
Count
de
B
#
#
#
#
(
<EOS>
making
him
a
low
bow
)
,
is
to
desire
he
will
not
.
  
<EOS>
The
Count
heard
me
with
great
good
nature
,
or
I
had
not
said
half
as
much
,
 
and
once
or
twice
said
,
 
C'est
bien
dit
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
rested
my
cause
there
 
and
determined
to
say
no
more
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
Count
led
the
discourse
:
 
we
talk'd
of
indifferent
things
,
 
of
books
,
and
politics
,
and
men
;
 
and
then
of
women
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
them
all
!
<EOS>
said
I
,
after
much
discourse
about
them
 
there
is
not
a
man
upon
earth
who
loves
them
so
much
as
I
do
:
 
after
all
the
foibles
I
have
seen
,
and
all
the
satires
I
have
read
against
them
,
still
I
love
them
;
being
firmly
persuaded
that
a
man
,
who
has
not
a
sort
of
affection
for
the
whole
sex
,
is
incapable
of
ever
loving
a
single
one
as
he
ought
.
  
<EOS>
Eh
bien
!
 
<EOS>
Monsieur
l'Anglois
,
said
the
Count
,
gaily
;
 
you
are
not
come
to
spy
the
nakedness
of
the
land
;
 
<EOS>
I
believe
you
;
 
ni
encore
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
THAT
of
our
women
!
 
<EOS>
But
permit
me
to
conjecture
,

<EOS>
I
have
something
within
me
which
can
not
bear
the
shock
of
the
least
indecent
insinuation
:
 
in
the
sportability
of
chit
-
chat
I
have
often
endeavoured
to
conquer
it
,
and
with
infinite
pain
have
hazarded
a
thousand
things
to
a
dozen
of
the
sex
together
,
 
the
least
of
which
I
could
not
venture
to
a
single
one
to
gain
heaven
.
  
<EOS>
Excuse
me
,
Monsieur
le
Count
,
said
I
;
 
as
for
the
nakedness
of
your
land
,
if
I
saw
it
,
I
should
cast
my
eyes
over
it
with
tears
in
them
;
 
and
for
that
of
your
women
(
blushing
at
the
idea
he
had
excited
in
me
)
<EOS>
I
am
so
evangelical
in
this
,
and
have
such
a
fellow
-
feeling
for
whatever
is
weak
about
them
,
that
I
would
cover
it
with
a
garment
if
I
knew
how
to
throw
it
on
:
  
<EOS>
B
<EOS>
ut
<EOS>
I
could
wish
,
continued
I
,
to
spy
the
nakedness
of
their
hearts
,
and
through
the
different
disguises
of
customs
,
climates
,
and
religion
,
find
out
what
is
good
in
them
to
fashion
my
own
by
:
  
a
nd
therefore
am
I
come
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
for
this
reason
,
Monsieur
le
Count
,
continued
I
,
that
I
have
not
seen
the
Palais
Royal
,
 
nor
the
Luxembourg
,
 
nor
the
Facade
of
the
Louvre
,
 
nor
have
attempted
to
swell
the
catalogues
we
have
of
pictures
,
statues
,
and
churches
.
 
<EOS>
I
conceive
every
fair
being
as
a
temple
,
and
would
rather
enter
in
,
and
see
the
original
drawings
and
loose
sketches
hung
up
in
it
,
than
the
Transfiguration
of
Raphael
itself
.
  
<EOS>
The
thirst
of
this
,
continued
I
,
as
impatient
as
that
which
inflames
the
breast
of
the
connoisseur
,
has
led
me
from
my
own
home
into
France
,
 
and
from
France
will
lead
me
through
Italy
;
 
'
tis
a
quiet
journey
of
the
heart
in
pursuit
of
Nature
,
and
those
affections
which
arise
out
of
her
,
which
make
us
love
each
other
,
  
and
the
world
,
better
than
we
do
.
  
<EOS>
The
Count
said
a
great
many
civil
things
to
me
upon
the
occasion
;
and
added
very
politely
,
how
much
he
stood
obliged
to
Shakespeare
for
making
me
known
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
a
propos
,
said
he
;
 
Shakespeare
is
full
of
great
things
;
 
he
forgot
a
small
punctilio
of
announcing
your
name
:

it

There
is
not

perplexing
affair
in
life
to
me
,
than
to
set
about
telling
any
one
who
I
am
,
 
<EOS>
for
there
is
scarce
any
body
I
can
not
give
a
better
account
of

myself
;
and
I
have
often
wished
I
could
do
it
in
a
single
word
,
 
and
have
an
end
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
only
time
and
occasion
in
my
life
I
could
accomplish
this
to
any
purpose
;
 
for
Shakespeare
lying
upon
the
table
,
and
recollecting
<EOS>
I
was
in
his
books
<EOS>
,
I
took
up
Hamlet
,
and
turning
immediately
to
the
grave

in

I
laid
my

upon
Yorick

with
my
finger
all
the
way
over
the

Me

<EOS>
said
I.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
whether
the
idea
of
poor
Yorick
's
skull
was
put
out
of
the
Count
's
mind
by
the
reality
of
my
own
,
or
by
what
magic
he
could
drop
a
period
of
seven

eight
hundred

makes
nothing

account
;

<EOS>
tis
<EOS>
certain
the
French
conceive
better
than

combine

I
wonder
at
nothing
in
this

,
and
the
less
at
this

inasmuch
as
one
of
the
first
of
our
own
Church
,
for
whose
candour
and
paternal
sentiments
<EOS>
I
have
the

fell
into
the

mistake
in
the
very

:
  
"
<EOS>
He

he
said

"

<EOS>
Good

said
I

there
are
two
Yoricks

<EOS>
The
Yorick
<EOS>
your

of

has
been
dead
and
buried
eight
hundred

he
flourished
in

the
other
Yorick
is
myself
,
who
have
flourished

my
Lord

in
no

<EOS>
-He
shook
his
head

<EOS>
Good

<EOS>
said
I
,
you

Alexander

Alexander

my
lord

"

he
replied

If

I
transported
myself
instantly
from

I
sat
in

Messina

got
so
busy
with
Don
Pedro

that
I
thought
not
of
Versailles

the

<EOS>
Sweet
pliability

<EOS>

surrender

sorrow

<EOS>
Long

I
not

so
great
a

upon
this

<EOS>
When
my
way
is
too
rough
for
my
feet
,
or
too
steep
for
my
strength
,
I
get
off
it
,
to
some
smooth
velvet
path
,
which
Fancy
has
scattered
over
with
rosebuds
of
delights
;
and
having
taken
a
few
turns
in
it

come
back
strengthened
and
<EOS>
refresh'd

<EOS>
When
evils
press
sore
upon

there
is
no

I
take
a

I
leave
it

as
I
have
a
clearer

I
force
myself
,
like

I
see
him

his

recognise

I
see
the
injured
spirit
wave
her
head
,
and
turn
off
silent
from
the
author
of
her
miseries
and
dishonours
;
 
I
lose
the
feelings
for
myself
in
hers
,
and
in
those
affections
which
were
wo

to
make
me
mourn
for
her
when
I
was
at

<EOS>
SURELY

IN

for

I

beating
up

added
the

,
I
could
not

it
these
two

Pardonnez

But

<EOS>
Yes

Et

I
answered

Indeed
I
did
jest

but
was
not
paid
for
it

'

entirely
at
my
own
expense

<EOS>
We
have
no
jester

said
I
;
the
last
we
had
was
in

licentious
reign
of
Charles

<EOS>
;
 
since
which
time
our
manners
have
been
so
gradually
refining

that
our

at
present
is
so
full
of
patriots

who
wish
for
NOTHING

the
honours
and
wealth
of
their
country

and
our
ladies
are
all

chaste

so

THE

As
the

was
directed
to
all
lieutenant

governors
,
governors
,
and
commandants
of
cities
,
generals
of
armies
,
justiciaries
,
and
all
officers
of
justice
,
to
let
Mr.
Yorick
the
king
's
jester
,
and
his
baggage
,
travel
quietly
along
,
I
own
the
triumph
of
obtaining
the
passport
was
not
a
little
<EOS>
tarnish'd
by
the
figure
I
cut
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
is
nothing
unmix'd
<EOS>
in
this
world
;
and
some
of
the
gravest
of
our
divines
have
carried
it
so
far
as
to
affirm
,
that
enjoyment
itself
was
attended
even
with
a
sigh
,
 
and
that
the
greatest
THEY
KNEW
OF
terminated
,
IN
A
GENERAL
WAY
,
in
little
better
than
a
convulsion
.
  
<EOS>
I
remember
the
grave
and
learned
Bevoriskius
,
in
his
Commentary
upon
the
Generations
from
Adam
,
very
naturally
breaks
off
in
the
middle
of
a
note
to
give
an
account
to
the
world
of
a
couple
of
sparrows
upon
the
out
-
edge
of
his
window
,
which
had
incommoded
him
all
the
time
he
wrote
,
and
at
last
had
entirely
taken
him
off
from
his
genealogy
.
     
<EOS>
'
Tis
strange
!
<EOS>
writes
Bevoriskius
;
but
the
facts
are
certain
,
for
I
have
had
the
curiosity
to
mark
them
down
one
by
one
with
my
pen
;
  
-but
the
cock
sparrow
,
during
the
little
time
that
I
could
have
finished
the
other
half
of
this
note
,
has
actually
interrupted
me
with
the
reiteration
of
his
caresses
three
-
and
-
twenty
times
and
a
half
.
  
<EOS>
How
merciful
,
adds
Bevoriskius
,
is
heaven
to
his
creatures
!
  
<EOS>
Ill
fated
Yorick

<EOS>
that
the
gravest
of
thy

should
be
able
to
write
that
to
the

which
stains
thy
face
with
crimson
to
copy
,
even
in
thy
study
.
  
<EOS>
But
this
is
nothing
to
my

So
I
twice

twice
beg
pardon
for

#
#
#

,
after
he
had
given
me
the
passport
.
  
<EOS>
The
reader
may
suppose
,
that
after
so
obliging
a
proof
of
courtesy
,
I
could
not
be
at
a
loss
to
say
something
handsome
to
the
enquiry
.
     
<EOS>
Mais

<EOS>
Speak
frankly

said
he
:
 
<EOS>
do
you
find
all
the
urbanity
in
the
French
which
the
world
give
us
the
honour
of
?
  
<EOS>
I
had
found
every
thing
,
I
said
,
which
confirmed
it

Vraiment

said
the
Count

To
an

replied
I.
  
<EOS>
The
Count
took
notice
of
the
word
exces
;
and
would
have
it
<EOS>
I
meant
more
than
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
I
defended
myself
a
long
time
as
well
as
I
could
against
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
insisted
I
had
a
reserve
,
and
that
I
would
speak
my
opinion
frankly
.
  
<EOS>
I
believe
,
Monsieur
le
Count
,
said
I
,
that
man
has
a
certain
compass
,
as
well
as
an
instrument
;
and
that
the
social
and
other
calls
have
occasion
by
turns
for
every
key
in
him
;
so
that
if
you
begin
a
note
too
high
or
too
low
,
there
must
be
a
want
either
in
the
upper
or
under
part
,
to
fill
up
the
system
of
harmony
.
 
<EOS>
The
Count
de

did
not
understand
music

desired
me
to
explain
it
some
other
way

<EOS>
A
polish'd
nation

my

said
I

makes

and
besides

Urbanity
itself
,
like
the
fair
sex
,
has
so
many
charms
<EOS>
,
it
goes
against
the
heart
to
say
it
can
do
ill
;
and
<EOS>
yet
,
I
believe
,
there
is
but
a
certain
line
of
perfection
,
that
man
,
take
him
altogether
,
is
empower'd
to
arrive
at
:
  
<EOS>
i

he
gets
beyond
,
he
rather
exchanges
qualities
than
gets
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
not
presume
to
say
how
far
this
has
affected
the
French
in
the
subject
we
are
speaking
of
;
 
but
,
should
it
ever
be
the
case
of
the
English
,
in
the
progress
of
their
refinements
,
to
arrive
at
the
same
polish
which
distinguishes
the
French
,
if
we
did
not
lose
the
politesse
du
coeur
,
which
inclines
men
more
to
humane
actions
than
courteous
ones
,
 
<EOS>
we
should
at
least
lose
that
distinct
variety
and
originality
of
character
,
which
distinguishes
them
,
not
only
from
each
other
,
but
from
all
the
world
besides
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
a
few
of
King
William
's
shillings
,
as
smooth
as
glass
,
in
my
pocket
;
and
foreseeing
they
would
be
of
use
in
the
illustration
of
my
hypothesis
,
I
had
got
them
into
my
hand
when
I
had
proceeded
so
far
:
      
See
,
Monsieur
le
Count
,
<EOS>
said
I
,
rising
up
,
and
laying
them
before
him
upon
the
table
,
 
by
jingling
and
rubbing
one
against
another
for
seventy
years
together
in
one
body
's
pocket
or
another
<EOS>
's
,
they
are
become
so
much
alike
,
you
can
scarce
distinguish
one
shilling
from
another
.
  
<EOS>
The
English
,
like
ancient
medals
,
kept
more
apart
,
and
passing
but
few
people
's
hands
,
preserve
the
first
sharpnesses
which
the
fine
hand
of
Nature
has
given
them
;
 
they
are
not
so
pleasant
to
feel
,
  
but
in
return
the
legend
is
so
visible
,
that
at
the
first
look
you
see
whose
image
and
superscription
they
bear
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
French
,
Monsieur
le
Count
,
added
I
(
<EOS>
wishing
to
soften
what
I
had
said
)
,
have
so
many
excellences
,
they
can
the
better
spare
this
;
 
<EOS>
they
are
a
loyal
,
a
gallant
,
a
generous
,
an
ingenious
,
and
good
temper'd
people
as
is
under
heaven
;
 
if
they
have
a
fault
 
they
are
too
SERIOUS
.
  
<EOS>
Mon
Dieu
!
<EOS>
cried
the
Count
,
rising
out
of
his
chair
.
  
<EOS>
Mais
vous
plaisantez
,
said
he
,
correcting
his
exclamation
.
 
<EOS>
I
laid
my
hand
upon
my
breast
,
and
with
earnest
gravity
assured
him
it
was
my
most
settled
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
The
Count
said
he
was
mortified
he
could
not
stay
to
hear
my
reasons
,
being
engaged
to
go
that
moment
to
dine
with
the
Duc
de
C
#
#
#
#
.
  
<EOS>
But
if
it
is
not
too
far
to
come
to
Versailles
to
eat
your
soup
with
me
,
I
beg
,
before
you
leave
France
,
I
may
have
the
pleasure
of
knowing
you
retract
your
opinion
,
 
or
,
in
what
manner
you
support
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
if
you
do
support
it
,
Monsieur
Anglois
,
said
he
,
you
must
do
it
with
all
your
powers
,
because
you
have
the
whole
world
against
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
promised
the
Count
<EOS>
I
would
do
myself
the
honour
of
dining
with
him
before
I
set
out
for
Italy
;
 
so
took
my
leave
.

THE
TEMPTATION
.
 
<EOS>
PARIS
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
alighted
at
the
hotel
,
the
porter
told
me
a
young
woman
with
a
bandbox
had
been
that
moment
enquiring
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
,
said
the
porter
,
whether
she
is
gone
away
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
the
key
of
my
chamber
of
him
,
and
went
upstairs
;
and
when
I
had
got
within
ten
steps
of
the
top
of
the
landing
before
my
door
,
I
met
her
coming
easily
down
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
fair
fille
de
chambre
<EOS>
I
had
walked
along
the
Quai
de
Conti
with
;
Madame
de
R
#
#
#
#
had
sent
her
upon
some
commission
to
a
marchande
des
modes
within
a
step
or
two
of
the
Hotel
de
Modene
;
and
as
I
had
fail'd
in
waiting
upon
her
,
had
bid
her
enquire
if
I
had
left
Paris
;
and
if
so
,
whether
I
had
not
left
a
letter
addressed
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
fair
fille
de
chambre
was
so
near
my
door
,
she
returned
back
,
and
went
into
the
room
with
me
for
a
moment
or
two
<EOS>
whilst
I
wrote
a
card
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
fine
still
evening
in
the
latter
end
of
the
month
of
May
,
  
<EOS>
-the
crimson
window
curtains
(
which
were
of
the
same
colour
as
those
of
the
bed
)
were
drawn
close
:
  
t
he
sun
was
setting
,
and
reflected
through
them
so
warm
a
tint
into
the
fair
fille
de
chambre
's
face
,
 
<EOS>
I
thought
she
blush'd
;
 
the
idea
of
it
made
me
blush
myself
:
  
<EOS>
w
e
were
quite
alone
;
and
that
superinduced
a
second
blush
before
the
first
could
get
off
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
a
sort
of
a
pleasing
half
guilty
blush
,
where
the
blood
is
more
in
fault
than
the
man
:
  
'
tis
sent
impetuous
from
the
heart
,
and
virtue
flies
after
it
,
 
not
to
call
it
back
,
but
to
make
the
sensation
of
it
more
delicious
to
the
nerves
:
  
'
tis
associated
.
     
<EOS>
But
I
'll
not
describe
it
;
 
I
felt
something
at
first
within
me
which
was
not
in
strict
unison
with
the
lesson
of
virtue
I
had
given
her
the
night
before
.
 
<EOS>
I
sought
five
minutes
for
a
card
;
 
I
knew
I
had
not
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
up
a
pen
.
 
<EOS>
I
laid
it
down
again
;
 
my
hand
trembled
:
  
t
he
devil
was
in
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
as
well
as
any
one
he
is
an
adversary
,
whom
,
if
we
resist
,
he
will
fly
from
us
;
 
<EOS>
but
I
seldom
resist
him
at
all
;
from
a
terror
,
though
I
may
conquer
,
I
may
still
get
a
hurt
in
the
combat
;
 
so
I
give
up
the
triumph
for
security
;
and
,
instead
of
thinking
to
make
him
fly
,
I
generally
fly
myself
.
  
<EOS>
The
fair
fille
de
chambre
came
close
up
to
the
bureau
where
I
was
looking
for
a
card
 
took
up
first
the
pen
I
cast
down
,
then
offer'd
to
hold
me
the
ink
;
she
offer'd
<EOS>
it
so
sweetly
,
I
was
going
to
accept
it
;
 
<EOS>
but
I
durst
not
;
 
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
,
my
dear
,
said
I
,
to
write
upon
.
 
<EOS>
Write
it
,
said
she
,
simply
,
upon
anything
.
     
<EOS>
I
was
just
going
to
cry
out
<EOS>
,
Then
I
will
write
it
,
fair
girl
!
<EOS>
upon
thy
lips
.
     
<EOS>
If
I
do
,
said
I
,
I
shall
perish
;
 
<EOS>
so
I
took
her
by
the
hand
,
and
led
her
to
the
door
,
and
begg'd
<EOS>
she
would
not
forget
the
lesson
I
had
given
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
,
indeed
she
would
not
;
 
and
,
as
she
uttered
it
with
some
earnestness
,
she
turn'd
about
,
and
gave
me
both
her
hands
,
closed
together
,
into
mine
;
 
it
was
impossible
not
to
compress
them
in
that
situation
;
 
I
<EOS>
wish'd
to
let
them
go
;
and
all
the
time
I
held
them
,
I
kept
arguing
within
myself
against
it
,
  
-and
still
I
held
them
on
.
 
<EOS>
In
two
minutes
I
found
I
had
all
the
battle
to
fight
over
again
;
 
<EOS>
and
I
felt
my
legs
and
every
limb
about
me
tremble
at
the
idea
.
  
<EOS>
The
foot
of
the
bed
was
within
a
yard
and
a
half
of
the
place
where
we
were
standing
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
still
hold
of
her
hands
 
<EOS>
and
how
it
happened
<EOS>
I
can
give
no
account
;
but
<EOS>
I
neither
ask'd
her
 
nor
drew
her
 
nor
did
I
think
of
the
bed
;
 
but
so
it
did
happen
,
we
both
sat
down
.
  
<EOS>
I
'll
just
show
you
,
said
the
fair
fille
de
chambre
,
the
little
purse
I
have
been
making
to
-
day
to
hold
your
crown
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
put
her
hand
into
her
right
pocket
,
which
was
next
me
,
and
felt
for
it
some
time
 
then
into
the
left
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
had
lost
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
never
bore
expectation
more
quietly
;
 
it
was
in
her
right
pocket
at
last
;
 
she
<EOS>
pull'd
it
out
<EOS>
;
it
was
of
green
taffeta
,
lined
with
a
little
bit
of
white
quilted
satin
,
and
just
big
enough
to
hold
the
crown
:
 
<EOS>
she
put
it
into
my
hand
;
 
it
was
pretty
;
and
I
held
it
ten
minutes
with
the
back
of
my
hand
resting
upon
her
lap
 
looking
sometimes
at
the
purse
,
sometimes
on
one
side
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
A
stitch
or
two
had
broke
out
in
the
gathers
of
my
stock
;
the
fair
fille
de
chambre
,
without
saying
a
word
,
took
out
her
little
housewife
,
threaded
a
small
needle
,
and
sew'd
it
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
foresaw
it
would
hazard
the
glory
of
the
day
;
and
,
as
she
<EOS>
pass'd
<EOS>
her
hand
in
silence
across
and
across
my
neck
in
the
manoeuvre
<EOS>
,
I
felt
the
laurels
shake
which
fancy
had
wreath'd
<EOS>
about
my
head
.
  
<EOS>
A
strap
had
given
way
in
her
walk
,
and
the
buckle
of
her
shoe
was
just
falling
off
.
 
<EOS>
See
<EOS>
,
said
the
fille
de
chambre
,
holding
up
her
foot
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
,
for
my
soul
but
fasten
the
buckle
in
return
,
and
putting
in
the
strap
,
 
and
lifting
up
the
other
foot
with
it
,
when
I
had
done
,
to
see
both
were
right
,
 
in
doing
it
too
suddenly
,
it
unavoidably
threw
the
fair
fille
de
chambre
off
her
centre
,
 
and
then
     
THE
CONQUEST
.
  
<EOS>
Yes
,
 
and
then
  
.
 
<EOS>
Ye
whose
clay
-
cold
heads
and
luke
-
warm
hearts
can
argue
down
or
mask
your
passions
,
tell
me
,
what
trespass
is
it
that
man
should
have
them
?
<EOS>
or
how
his
spirit
stands
answerable
to
the
Father
of
spirits
but
for
his
conduct
under
them
?
  
<EOS>
If
Nature
has
so
wove
her
web
of
kindness
,
that
some
threads
of
love
and
desire
are
entangled
with
the
piece
,
 
must
the
whole
web
be
rent
in
drawing
them
out
?
 
<EOS>
Whip
me
such
stoics
,
great
Governor
of
Nature
!
<EOS>
said
I
to
myself
:
  
<EOS>
w
herever
thy
providence
shall
place
me
for
the
trials
of
my
virtue
;
 
<EOS>
whatever
is
my
danger
,
 
<EOS>
whatever
is
my
situation
,
 
let
me
feel
the
movements
which
rise
out
of
it
,
and
which
belong
to
me
as
a
man
,
 
and
,
if
I
govern
them
as
a
good
one
,
I
will
trust
the
issues
to
thy
justice
;
for
thou
hast
made
us
,
and
not
we
ourselves
.
  
<EOS>
As
I
finished
my
address
,
I
raised
the
fair
fille
de
chambre
up
by
the
hand
,
and
led
her
out
of
the
room
:
  
<EOS>
s
he
stood
by
me
till
I
locked
the
door
and
put
the
key
in
my
pocket
,
 
and
then
,
 
the
victory
being
quite
decisive
 
and
not
till
then
,
I
press'd
<EOS>
my
lips
to
her
cheek
,
and
taking
her
by
the
hand
again
,
led
her
safe
to
the
gate
of
the
hotel

THE
MYSTERY
.
 
<EOS>
PARIS
.
  
<EOS>
If
a
man
knows
the
heart
,
he
will
know
it
was
impossible
to
go
back
instantly
to
my
chamber
;
 
it
was
touching
a
cold
key
with
a
flat
third
to
it
upon
the
close
of
a
piece
of
music
,
which
had
call'd
forth
my
affections
:
  
<EOS>
t
herefore
,
when
I
let
go
the
hand
of
the
fille
de
chambre
,
I
remained
at
the
gate
of
the
hotel
for
some
time
,
looking
at
every
one
who
pass'd
<EOS>
by
,
 
and
forming
conjectures
upon
them
,
till
my
attention
got
fix'd
upon
a
single
object
which
confounded
all
kind
of
reasoning
upon
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
tall
figure
of
a
philosophic
,
serious
,
adust
look
,
which
passed
and
repass'd
sedately
along
the
street
,
making
a
turn
of
about
sixty
paces
on
each
side
of
the
gate
of
the
hotel
;
 
<EOS>
the
man
was
about
fifty
-
two
 
had
a
small
cane
under
his
arm
 
was
dress'd
<EOS>
in
a
dark
drab
-
colour'd
coat
,
waistcoat
,
and
breeches
,
which
seem'd
to
have
seen
some
years
service
:
  
t
hey
were
still
clean
,
and
there
was
a
little
air
of
frugal
proprete
throughout
him
.
 
<EOS>
By
his
pulling
off
his
hat
,
and
his
attitude
of
accosting
a
good
many
in
his
way
,
I
saw
he
was
asking
charity
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
got
a
sous
or
two
out
of
my
pocket
ready
to
give
him
,
as
he
took
me
in
his
turn
.
 
<EOS>
He
pass'd
by
me
without
asking
anything
 
and
yet
did
not
go
five
steps
further
before
he
ask'd
charity
of
a
little
woman
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
much
more
likely
to
have
given
of
the
two
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
scarce
done
with
the
woman
,
when
he
pull'd
off
his
hat
to
another
who
was
coming
the
same
way
.
 
<EOS>
An
ancient
gentleman
came
slowly
 
and
,
after
him
,
a
young
smart
one
.
  
<EOS>
He
let
them
both
pass
,
and
ask'd
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
stood
observing
him
half
an
hour
,
in
which
time
he
had
made
a
dozen
turns
backwards
and
forwards
,
and
found
that
he
invariably
pursued
the
same
plan
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
two
things
very
singular
in
this
,
which
set
my
brain
to
work
,
and
to
no
purpose
:
  
t
he
first
was
,
why
the
man
should
ONLY
tell
his
story
to
the
sex
;
 
and
,
secondly
,
 
what
kind
of
story
it
was
,
and
what
species
of
eloquence
it
could
be
,
<EOS>
which
soften'd
<EOS>
the
hearts
of
the
women
,
which
he
knew
'
twas
to
no
purpose
to
practise
upon
the
men
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
two
other
circumstances
,
which
entangled
this
mystery
;
  
the
one
was
,
he
told
every
woman
what
he
had
to
say
in
her
ear
,
and
in
a
way
which
had
much
more
the
air
of
a
secret
than
a
petition
;
  
the
other
was
,
it
was
always
successful
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
<EOS>
stopp'd
<EOS>
a
woman
,
but
she
pull'd
out
her
purse
,
and
immediately
gave
him
something
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
form
no
system
to
explain
the
phenomenon
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
got
a
riddle
to
amuse
me
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
;
so
I
<EOS>
walk'd
upstairs
to
my
chamber
.

I
was
immediately
followed
up
by
the
master
of
the
hotel
,
who
came
into
my
room
to
tell
me
I
must
provide
lodgings
elsewhere
.
 
<EOS>
How
so
,
friend
?
<EOS>
said
<EOS>
I.
 
He
answered
,
I
had
had
a
young
woman
lock'd
up
with
me
<EOS>
two
hours
that
evening
in
my
bedchamber
,
and
'
twas
against
the
rules
of
his
house
.
 
<EOS>
Very
well
,
said
I
,
we
'll
all
part
friends
then
,
 
for
the
girl
is
no
worse
,
 
and
I
am
no
worse
,
 
and
you
will
be
just
as
I
found
you
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
enough
,
he
said
,
to
overthrow
the
credit
of
his
hotel
.
 
<EOS>
Voyez
vous
,
Monsieur
,
said
he
,
pointing
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
we
had
been
sitting
upon
.
 
<EOS>
I
own
it
had
something
of
the
appearance
of
an
evidence
;
but
my
pride
not
suffering
me
to
enter
into
any
detail
of
the
case
,
I
exhorted
him
to
let
his
soul
sleep
in
peace
,
as
I
resolved
to
let
mine
do
that
night
,
and
that
I
would
discharge
what
I
owed
him
at
breakfast
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
minded
,
Monsieur
,
said
he
,
if
you
had
had
twenty
girls
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
a
score
more
,
replied
I
,
interrupting
him
,
than
I
ever
reckon'd
upon
 
Provided
,
added
he
<EOS>
,
it
had
been
<EOS>
but
in
a
morning
.
  
<EOS>
And
does
the
difference
of
the
time
of
the
day
at
Paris
make
a
difference
in
the
sin
?
 
<EOS>
It
made
a
difference
,
he
said
,
in
the
scandal
.
 
<EOS>
I
like
a
good
distinction
in
my
heart
;
and
can
not
say
I
was
intolerably
out
of
temper
with
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
own
it
is
necessary
,
resumed
the
master
of
the
hotel
,
that
a
stranger
at
Paris
should
have
the
opportunities
presented
to
him
of
buying
lace
and
silk
stockings
and
ruffles
,
et
tout
cela
;
 
and
'
tis
nothing
if
a
woman
comes
with
a
band
-
box
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
my
conscience
!
<EOS>
said
I
<EOS>
,
she
had
one
<EOS>
but
I
never
look'd
<EOS>
into
it
.
 
<EOS>
Then
Monsieur
,
said
he
,
has
bought
nothing
?
  
<EOS>
-Not
<EOS>
one
earthly
thing
,
replied
<EOS>
I.
 
Because
,
said
he
,
I
could
recommend
one
to
you
who
would
use
you
en
conscience
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
must
see
her
this
night
,
said
I.
 
He
made
me
a
low
bow
,
and
<EOS>
walk'd
down
.
  
<EOS>
Now
shall
I
triumph
over
this
maitre
d'hotel
,
cried
I
,
 
and
what
then
?
 
<EOS>
Then
I
shall
let
him
see
I
know
he
is
a
dirty
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
And
what
then
?
 
<EOS>
What
then
?
 
<EOS>
I
was
too
near
myself
to
say
it
was
for
the
sake
of
others
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
no
good
answer
left
;
 
there
was
more
of
spleen
than
principle
in
my
project
,
and
I
was
sick
of
it
before
the
execution
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
the
grisette
came
in
with
her
box
of
lace
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
buy
nothing
,
however
,
said
I
,
within
myself
.
  
<EOS>
The
grisette
would
show
me
everything
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
hard
to
please
:
 
<EOS>
she
would
not
seem
to
see
it
;
she
opened
her
little
magazine
,
and
laid
all
her
laces
one
after
another
before
me
;
 
unfolded
and
folded
them
up
again
one
by
one
with
the
most
patient
sweetness
.
 
<EOS>
I
might
buy
,
 
or
not
;
 
she
would
let
me
have
everything
at
my
own
price
:
   
<EOS>
the
poor
creature
<EOS>
seem'd
<EOS>
anxious
to
get
a
penny
;
and
laid
herself
out
to
win
me
,
and
not
so
much
in
a
manner
which
seem'd
artful
,
as
in
one
I
felt
simple
and
caressing
.
  
<EOS>
If
there
is
not
a
fund
of
honest
gullibility
in
man
,
so
much
the
worse
;
 
my
heart
relented
,
and
I
gave
up
my
second
resolution
as
quietly
as
the
first
.
 
<EOS>
Why
should
I
chastise
one
for
the
trespass
of
another
?
 
<EOS>
If
thou
art
tributary
to
this
tyrant
of
an
host
,
thought
I
,
looking
up
in
her
face
,
so
much
harder
is
thy
bread
.
  
<EOS>
If
I
had
not
had
more
than
four
louis
d'ors
in
my
purse
,
there
was
no
such
thing
as
rising
up
and
showing
her
the
door
,
till
I
had
first
laid
three
of
them
out
in
a
pair
of
ruffles
.
     
<EOS>
The
master
of
the
hotel
will
share
the
profit
with
her
;
 
no
matter
,
 
then
I
have
only
paid
as
many
a
poor
soul
has
PAID
before
me
,
for
an
act
he
COULD
not
do
,
or
think
of
.
  
<EOS>
THE
RIDDLE
.
 
<EOS>
PARIS
.
  
<EOS>
When
La
Fleur
came
up
to
wait
upon
me
at
supper
,
he
told
me
how
sorry
the
master
of
the
hotel
was
for
his
affront
to
me
in
bidding
me
<EOS>
change
my
lodgings
.
  
<EOS>
A
man
who
values
a
good
night
's
rest
will
not
lie
down
with
enmity
in
his
heart
,
if
he
can
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
bid
<EOS>
La
Fleur
tell
the
master
of
the
hotel
,
that
I
was
sorry
on
my
side
for
the
occasion
I
had
given
him
;
 
and
you
may
tell
him
,
if
you
will
,
La
Fleur
,
added
I
,
that
if
the
young
woman
should
call
again
,
I
shall
not
see
her
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
a
sacrifice
not
to
him
,
but
myself
,
having
resolved
,
after
so
narrow
an
escape
,
to
run
no
more
risks
,
but
to
leave
Paris
,
if
it
was
possible
,
with
all
the
virtue
<EOS>
I
enter'd
<EOS>
it
.
  
<EOS>
C'est
deroger
a
noblesse
,
Monsieur
,
said
La
Fleur
,
making
me
a
bow
down
to
the
ground
as
he
said
it
.
 
<EOS>
Et
encore
,
Monsieur
,
said
he
,
may
change
his
sentiments
;
 
and
if
(
par
hazard
)
<EOS>
he
should
like
to
amuse
himself
,
 
<EOS>
I
find
no
amusement
in
it
,
said
I
,
interrupting
him
.
     
<EOS>
Mon
Dieu
!
<EOS>
said
La
Fleur
,
 
and
took
away
.
  
<EOS>
In
an
hour
's
time
he
came
to
put
me
to
bed
,
and
was
more
than
commonly
officious
:
  
<EOS>
s
omething
hung
upon
his
lips
to
say
to
me
,
or
ask
me
,
which
he
could
not
get
off
:
 
I
could
not
conceive
what
it
was
,
and
indeed
gave
myself
little
trouble
to
find
it
out
,
as
I
had
another
riddle
so
much
more
interesting
upon
my
mind
,
which
was
that
of
the
man
's
asking
charity
before
the
door
of
the
hotel
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
given
anything
to
have
got
to
the
bottom
of
it
;
and
that
,
not
out
of
curiosity
,
 
'
tis
so
low
a
principle
of
enquiry
,
in
general
,
I
would
not
purchase
the
gratification
of
it
with
a
two
-
sous
piece
;
 
but
a
secret
,
I
thought
,
which
so
soon
and
so
certainly
soften'd
the
heart
of
every
woman
you
came
near
<EOS>
,
was
a
secret
at
least
equal
to
the
philosopher
's
stone
;
had
I
both
the
Indies
,
I
would
have
given
up
one
to
have
been
master
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
toss'd
and
turn'd
<EOS>
it
almost
all
night
long
in
my
brains
to
no
manner
of
purpose
;
and
when
I
awoke
in
the
morning
,
I
found
my
spirits
as
much
troubled
with
my
dreams
,
as
ever
the
King
of
Babylon
had
been
with
his
;
and
I
will
not
hesitate
to
affirm
,
it
would
have
puzzled
all
the
wise
men
of
Paris
as
much
as
those
of
Chaldea
to
have
given
its
interpretation
.
  
<EOS>
LE
DIMANCHE
.
 
<EOS>
PARIS
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
Sunday
;
and
when
La
Fleur
came
in
,
in
the
morning
,
with
my
coffee
and
roll
and
butter
,
he
had
got
himself
so
gallantly
<EOS>
array'd
,
I
scarce
knew
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
covenanted
at
Montreuil
to
give
him
a
new
hat
with
a
silver
button
and
loop
,
and
four
louis
d'ors
,
pour
s'adoniser
,
when
we
got
to
Paris
;
and
the
poor
fellow
,
to
do
him
justice
,
had
done
wonders
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
bought
a
bright
,
clean
,
good
scarlet
coat
,
and
a
pair
of
breeches
of
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
not
a
crown
worse
,
he
said
,
for
the
wearing
.
 
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
wish'd
him
hang'd
<EOS>
for
telling
me
.
 
<EOS>
They
<EOS>
look'd
<EOS>
so
fresh
,
that
though
I
knew
the
thing
could
not
be
done
,
yet
I
would
rather
have
imposed
upon
my
fancy
with
thinking
I
had
bought
them
new
for
the
fellow
,
than
that
they
had
come
out
of
the
Rue
de
Friperie
.
  
<EOS>
This
is
a
nicety
which
makes
not
the
heart
sore
at
Paris
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
purchased
,
moreover
,
a
handsome
blue
satin
waistcoat
,
fancifully
enough
embroidered
:
  
<EOS>
t
his
was
indeed
something
the
worse
for
the
service
it
had
done
,
but
'
twas
clean
scour'd
;
 
the
gold
had
been
touch'd
up
,
and
upon
the
whole
was
rather
showy
than
otherwise
;
 
and
as
the
blue
was
not
violent
,
it
suited
with
the
coat
and
breeches
very
well
:
 
<EOS>
he
had
squeez'd
out
of
the
money
,
moreover
,
a
new
bag
and
a
solitaire
;
and
had
insisted
with
the
fripier
upon
a
gold
pair
of
garters
to
his
breeches
knees
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
purchased
muslin
ruffles
,
bien
brodees
,
with
four
livres
of
his
own
money
;
 
and
a
pair
of
white
silk
stockings
for
five
more
;
 
and
to
top
all
,
nature
had
given
him
a
handsome
figure
,
without
costing
him
a
sous
.
  
<EOS>
He
entered
the
room
thus
set
off
,
with
his
hair
dressed
in
the
first
style
,
and
with
a
handsome
bouquet
in
his
breast
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
there
was
that
look
of
festivity
in
everything
about
him
,
which
at
once
put
me
in
mind
<EOS>
it
was
Sunday
;
 
and
,
by
combining
both
together
,
it
instantly
struck
me
,
that
the
favour
he
wish'd
to
ask
of
me
the
night
before
,
was
to
spend
the
day
as
every
body
in
Paris
spent
it
besides
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
scarce
made
the
conjecture
,
when
La
Fleur
,
with
infinite
humility
,
but
with
a
look
of
trust
,
as
if
I
should
not
refuse
him
,
begg'd
<EOS>
I
would
grant
him
the
day
,
pour
faire
le
galant
vis
-
a
-
vis
de
sa
maitresse
.
  
<EOS>
Now
it
was
the
very
thing
I
intended
to
do
myself
vis
-
a
-
vis
<EOS>
Madame
de
R
#
#
#
#
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
retained
the
remise
on
purpose
for
it
,
and
it
would
not
have
mortified
my
vanity
to
have
had
a
servant
so
well
dress'd
as
La
Fleur
was
,
to
have
got
up
behind
it
:
 
<EOS>
I
never
could
have
worse
spared
him
.
  
<EOS>
But
we
must
FEEL
,
not
argue
in
these
embarrassments
.
 
<EOS>
The
sons
and
daughters
of
Service
part
with
liberty
,
but
not
with
nature
,
in
their
contracts
;
they
are
flesh
and
blood
,
and
have
their
little
vanities
and
wishes
in
the
midst
of
the
house
of
bondage
,
as
well
as
their
task
-
masters
;
 
no
doubt
,
they
have
set
their
self
-
denials
at
a
price
,
 
and
their
expectations
are
so
unreasonable
,
that
I
would
often
disappoint
them
,
but
that
their
condition
puts
it
so
much
in
my
power
to
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
BEHOLD
,
 
BEHOLD
<EOS>
,
I
AM
THY
SERVANT
 
<EOS>
disarms
me
at
once
of
the
powers
of
a
master
.
     
<EOS>
Thou
shalt
go
,
La
Fleur
!
<EOS>
said
I.
     
<EOS>
And
what
mistress
,
La
Fleur
,
said
I
,
canst
thou
have
picked
up
in
so
little
a
time
at
Paris
?
 
<EOS>
La
Fleur
laid
his
hand
upon
his
breast
,
and
said
'
twas
a
petite
demoiselle
,
at
Monsieur
le
Count
de
B
#
#
#
#
's
.
  
<EOS>
La
Fleur
had
a
heart
made
for
society
;
and
,
to
speak
the
truth
of
him
,
let
as
few
occasions
slip
him
as
his
master
;
 
so
that
somehow
or
other
,
 
but
<EOS>
how
,
 
heaven
knows
,
 
he
had
connected
himself
with
the
demoiselle
upon
the
landing
of
the
staircase
,
during
the
time
I
was
taken
up
with
my
passport
;
and
as
there
was
time
enough
for
me
to
win
the
Count
to
my
interest
,
La
Fleur
had
contrived
to
make
it
do
to
win
the
maid
to
his
.
 
<EOS>
The
family
,
it
seems
,
was
to
be
at
Paris
that
day
,
and
he
had
made
a
party
with
her
,
and
two
or
three
more
of
the
Count
's
household
,
upon
the
boulevards
.
  
<EOS>
Happy
people
!
<EOS>
that
once
a
week
at
least
are
sure
to
lay
down
all
your
cares
together
,
and
dance
and
sing
and
sport
away
the
weights
of
grievance
,
which
bow
down
the
spirit
of
other
nations
to
the
earth
.
  
<EOS>
THE
FRAGMENT
.
 
<EOS>
PARIS
.
  
<EOS>
La
Fleur
had
left
me
something
to
amuse
myself
with
for
the
day
more
than
I
had
bargain'd
for
,
or
could
have
enter'd
<EOS>
either
into
his
head
or
mine
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
brought
the
little
print
of
butter
upon
a
currant
leaf
:
 
and
as
the
morning
was
warm
,
and
he
had
a
good
step
to
bring
it
,
he
had
begg'd
a
sheet
of
waste
paper
to
put
betwixt
the
currant
leaf
and
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
As
that
was
plate
sufficient
,
I
bade
him
lay
it
upon
the
table
as
it
was
;
and
as
I
resolved
to
stay
within
all
day
,
I
ordered
him
to
call
upon
the
traiteur
,
to
bespeak
my
dinner
,
and
leave
me
to
breakfast
by
myself
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
had
finished
the
butter
,
I
threw
the
currant
-
leaf
out
of
the
window
,
and
was
going
to
do
the
same
by
the
waste
paper
;
 
but
stopping
to
read
a
line
first
,
and
that
drawing
me
on
to
a
second
and
third
,
 
I
thought
it
better
worth
;
so
I
shut
the
window
,
and
drawing
a
chair
up
to
it
,
I
sat
down
to
read
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
in
the
old
French
of
Rabelais
's
time
,
and
for
aught
I
know
might
have
been
wrote
by
him
:
  
<EOS>
i
t
was
moreover
in
a
Gothic
letter
,
and
that
so
faded
and
gone
off
by
damps
and
length
of
time
,
it
cost
me
infinite
trouble
to
make
anything
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
threw
it
down
;
and
then
wrote
a
letter
to
Eugenius
;
 
<EOS>
then
I
took
it
up
again
,
and
embroiled
my
patience
with
it
afresh
;
 
and
then
to
cure
that
,
I
wrote
a
letter
to
Eliza
.
 
<EOS>
Still
it
kept
hold
of
me
;
and
the
difficulty
of
understanding
it
increased
but
the
desire
.
  
<EOS>
I
got
my
dinner
;
and
after
I
had
enlightened
my
mind
with
a
bottle
of
Burgundy
;
I
at
it
again
,
 
and
,
after
two
or
three
hours
poring
upon
it
,
with
almost
as
deep
attention
as
ever
Gruter
or
Jacob
Spon
did
upon
a
nonsensical
inscription
,
I
thought
I
made
sense
of
it
;
but
to
make
sure
of
it
,
the
best
way
,
I
imagined
,
was
to
turn
it
into
English
,
and
see
how
it
would
look
then
;
 
<EOS>
so
I
went
on
leisurely
,
as
a
trifling
man
does
,
sometimes
writing
a
sentence
,
  
then
taking
a
turn
or
two
,
 
and
then
looking
how
the
world
went
,
out
of
the
window
;
<EOS>
so
that
it
was
nine
o'clock
at
night
before
I
had
done
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
began
and
read
it
as
follows
.
  
<EOS>
THE
FRAGMENT
.
 
<EOS>
PARIS
.
     
<EOS>
Now
,
as
the
notary
's
wife
disputed
the
point
with
the
notary
with
too
much
heat
,
 
I
wish
,
said
the
notary
,
(
throwing
down
the
parchment
)
that
there
was
another
notary
here
only
to
set
down
and
attest
all
this
.
        
<EOS>
And
what
would
you
do
then
,
Monsieur
?
<EOS>
said
she
,
rising
hastily
up
.
 
<EOS>
The
notary
's
wife
was
a
little
fume
of
a
woman
,
and
the
notary
thought
it
well
to
avoid
a
hurricane
by
a
mild
reply
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
go
,
answered
he
,
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
go
to
the
devil
,
answer'd
the
notary
's
wife
.
  
<EOS>
Now
there
happening
to
be
<EOS>
but
one
bed
in
the
house
,
the
other
two
rooms
being
unfurnished
,
as
is
the
custom
at
Paris
,
and
the
notary
not
caring
to
lie
in
the
same
bed
with
a
woman
who
had
but
that
moment
sent
him
pell
mell
to
the
devil
,
went
forth
with
his
hat
and
cane
and
short
cloak
,
the
night
being
very
windy
,
and
<EOS>
walk'd
out
,
ill
at
ease
,
towards
the
Pont
Neuf
.
  
<EOS>
Of
all
the
bridges
which
ever
were
built
,
the
whole
world
who
have
pass'd
over
the
Pont
Neuf
must
own
,
that
it
is
the
noblest
,
 
the
finest
,
 
the
grandest
,
 
the
lightest
,
 
the
longest
,
 
the
broadest
,
that
ever
conjoin'd
land
and
land
together
upon
the
face
of
the
terraqueous
globe
.
  
<EOS>
[
By
this
it
seems
as
if
the
author
of
the
fragment
had
not
been
a
Frenchman
.
]
  
<EOS>
The
worst
fault
which
divines
and
the
doctors
of
the
Sorbonne
can
allege
against
it
is
,
that
if
there
is
but
a
capfull
of
wind
in
or
about
Paris
,
'
tis
more
blasphemously
sacre
Dieu'd
there
than
in
any
other
aperture
of
the
whole
city
,
 
and
with
reason
good
and
cogent
,
Messieurs
;
for
it
comes
against
you
without
crying
garde
d'eau
,
and
with
such
unpremeditable
puffs
,
that
of
the
few
who
cross
it
with
their
hats
on
,
not
one
in
fifty
but
hazards
two
livres
and
a
half
,
which
is
its
full
worth
.
  
<EOS>
The
poor
notary
,
just
as
he
was
passing
by
the
sentry
,
instinctively
clapp'd
his
cane
to
the
side
of
it
,
but
in
raising
it
up
,
the
point
of
his
cane
catching
hold
of
the
loop
of
the
sentinel
's
hat
,
hoisted
it
over
the
spikes
of
the
ballustrade
clear
into
the
Seine

a

who
catched
it

<EOS>
The
sentry
,
being
a
Gascon
,
incontinently
twirled
up
his
whiskers
,
and
levell'd
his
arquebuss
.
  
<EOS>
Arquebusses
in
those
days
went
off
with
matches
;
and
an
old
woman
's
paper
lantern
at
the
end
of
the
bridge
happening
to
be
blown
out
,
she
had
borrow'd
<EOS>
the
sentry
's
match
to
light
it
:
  
<EOS>
i

gave
a
moment

turn
the

said
he
,
catching
off
the
notary
's
castor
,
and
legitimating
the
capture
with
the
boatman
's
adage
.
  
<EOS>
The
poor
notary
crossed
the
bridge
,
and
passing
along
the
Rue
de
Dauphine
into
the
fauxbourgs
of
St.
Germain
,
lamented
himself
as
he
walked
along
in
this
manner
:
      
<EOS>
Luckless
man
that
I
am
!
<EOS>
said
the
notary
,
to
be
the
sport
of
hurricanes
all
my
days
:
  
<EOS>
t
o
be
born
to
have
the
storm
of
ill
language
levell'd
against
me
and
my
profession
wherever
I
go
;
to
be
forced
into
marriage
by
the
thunder
of
the
church
to
a
tempest
of
a
woman
;
 
to
be
driven
forth
out
of
my
house
by
domestic
winds
,
and
despoil'd
of
my
castor
by
pontific
ones
!
 
<EOS>
to
be
here
,
bareheaded
,
in
a
windy
night
,
at
the
mercy
of
the
ebbs
and
flows
of
accidents
!
 
<EOS>
Where
am
I
to
lay
my
head
?
 
<EOS>
Miserable

<EOS>
what
wind

<EOS>
As
the
notary
was
passing
on
by
a
dark
passage
,
complaining
in
this
sort
,
a
voice
call'd
out
to
a
girl
,
to
bid
her
run
for
the
next
notary
.
 
<EOS>
Now
the
notary
being
the
next
,
and
availing
himself
of
his
situation
,
<EOS>
walk'd
<EOS>
up
the
passage
to
the
door
,
and
passing
through
an
old
sort
of
a
saloon
,
was
usher'd
into
a
large
chamber
,
dismantled
of
everything
but
a
long
military
pike
,
 
a
breastplate
,
  
-a
rusty
old
sword
,
and
bandoleer
,
hung
up
,
equidistant
,
in
four
different
places
against
the
wall

<EOS>
An
old
personage
who
had
heretofore
been
a
gentleman
,
and
unless
decay
of
fortune
taints
the
blood
along
with
it
,
was
a
gentleman
at
that
time
,
lay
supporting
his
head
upon
his
hand
in
his
bed
;
a
little
table
with
a
taper
burning
was
set
close
beside
it
,
and
close
by
the
table
was
placed
a
chair
:
  
<EOS>
t
he
notary
sat
him
down
in
it
;
and
pulling
out
his
inkhorn
and
a
sheet
or
two
of
paper
which
he
had
in
his
pocket
,
he
placed
them
before
him
;
and
dipping
his
pen
in
his
ink
,
and
leaning
his
breast
over
the
table
,
he
disposed
everything
to
make
the
gentleman
's
last
will
and
testament
  
Alas

<EOS>
Monsieur
le
Notaire
,
said
the
gentleman
,
raising
himself
up
a
little
,
I
have
nothing
to
bequeath
,
which
will
pay
the
expense
of
bequeathing
,
except
the
history
of
myself
,
which
I
could
not
die
in
peace
,
unless
I
left
it
as
a
legacy
to
the
world
:
 
the
profits
arising
out
of
it
<EOS>
I
bequeath
to
you
for
the
pains
of
taking
it
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
story
so
uncommon
<EOS>
,
it
must
be
read
by
all
mankind
;
 
it
will
make
the
fortunes
of
your
house

<EOS>
The
notary
dipp'd
<EOS>
his
pen
into
his
inkhorn
.
 
<EOS>
Almighty
Director
of
every
event
in
my
life
!
<EOS>
said
the
old
gentleman
,
looking
up
earnestly
,
and
raising
his
hands
towards
heaven
,
 
Thou
,
whose
hand
has
led
me
on
through
such
a
labyrinth
of
strange
passages
down
into
this
scene
of
desolation
,
assist
the
decaying
memory
of
an
old
,
infirm
,
and
broken
-
hearted
man
;
 
direct
my
tongue
by
the
spirit
of
thy
eternal
truth
,
that
this
stranger
may
set
down
nought
but
what
is
written
in
that
BOOK
,
from
whose
records
,
said
he
,
clasping
his
hands
together
,
I
am
to
be
condemn'd
or
acquitted
!
 
<EOS>
the
notary
held
up
the
point
of
his
pen
betwixt
the
taper
and
his
eye
.
     
<EOS>
It
is
a
story
,
Monsieur
le
Notaire
,
<EOS>
said
the
gentleman
,
which
will
rouse
up
every
affection
in
nature
;
 
it
will
kill
the
humane
,
and
touch
the
heart
of
Cruelty
herself
with
pity
.
        
<EOS>
The
notary
was
inflamed
with
a
desire
to
begin
,
and
put
his
pen
a
third
time
into
his
ink
-
horn
 
and
the
old
gentleman
,
turning
a
little
more
towards
the
notary
,
began
to
dictate
his
story
in
these
words
:
         
<EOS>
And
where
is
the
rest
of
it
,
La

<EOS>
said
I
,
as
he
just
then
enter'd
<EOS>
the
room

<EOS>

<EOS>
When
La
Fleur
came
up
close
to
the
table
,
and
was
made
to
comprehend
what
I
wanted
,
he
told
me
there
were
only
two
other
sheets
of
it
,
which
he
had
wrapped
round
the
stalks
of
a
bouquet
to
keep
it
together
,
which
he
had
presented
to
the
demoiselle
upon
the
boulevards
.
 
<EOS>
Then
prithee
,
La
Fleur
,
said
I
,
step
back
to
her
to
the
Count
de
B
#
#
#
#
's
hotel
,
and
see
if
thou
canst
get
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
doubt
of
it
,
said
La
Fleur
;
 
and
away
he
flew
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
very
little
time
the
poor
fellow
came
back
quite
out
of
breath
,
with
deeper
marks
of
disappointment
in
his
looks
than
could
arise
from
the
simple
irreparability
of
the
fragment
.
 
<EOS>
Juste
Ciel
!
<EOS>
in
less
than
two
minutes
that
the
poor
fellow
had
taken
his
last
tender
farewell
of
her
 
his
faithless
mistress
had
given
his
gage
d'amour
to
one
of
the
Count

footmen
,
 
the
footman
to
a
young
sempstress
,
 
and
the
sempstress
to
a
fiddler
,
with
my
fragment
at
the
end
of
it

<EOS>
Our
misfortunes
were
involved
together
:
  
<EOS>
I
 
gave
a
sigh
,
 
and
<EOS>
La
Fleur
echoed
it
back
again
to
my
ear
.
     
<EOS>
How
perfidious
!
<EOS>
cried
La
Fleur
.
 
<EOS>
How
unlucky
!
<EOS>
said
I.
     
I
should
not
have
been
mortified

Monsieur

quoth
La

if
she
had
lost
it

Nor
I

I

The
man
who
either
disdains
or
fears
to
walk
up
a
dark
entry
may
be
an
excellent
good
man
,
and
fit
for
a
hundred
things
,
but
he
will
not
do
to
make
a
good
Sentimental
Traveller

<EOS>
I
count
little
of
the
many
things
I
see
pass
at
broad
noonday
,
in
large
and
open
streets
.
 
<EOS>
Nature
is
shy
,
and
hates
to
act
before
spectators
;
but
in
such
an
unobserved
corner
you
sometimes
see
a
single
short
scene
of
hers
worth
all
the
sentiments
of
a
dozen
French
plays
compounded
together
,
 
and
yet
they
are
absolutely
fine
;
 
and
whenever
I
have
a
more
brilliant
affair
upon
my
hands
than
common
,
as
they
suit
a
preacher
just
as
well
as
a
hero
,
I
generally
make
my
sermon
out
of
'em
;
 
and
for
the
text
,
 
"
Cappadocia
,
Pontus
and
Asia
,
Phrygia
and
Pamphylia
,
"
 
is
as
good
as
any
one
in
the
Bible
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
a
long
dark
passage
issuing
out
from
the
Opera
Comique
into
a
narrow
street
;
'
tis
trod
by
a
few
who
humbly
wait
for
a
fiacre
,
{

}
or
wish
to
get
off
quietly
o'foot
when
the
opera
is
done
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
it
,
towards
the
theatre
,
'
tis
lighted
by
a
small
candle
,
the
light
of
which
is
almost
lost
before
you
get
half
-
way
down
,
but
near
the
door
 
'
tis
more
for
ornament
than
use
:
you
see
it
as
a
fixed
star
of
the
least
magnitude
;
it
burns
,
 
but
does
little
good
to
the
world
,
that
we
know
of
.
  
<EOS>
In
returning
along
this
passage
,
I
discerned
,
as
I
approached
within
five
or
six
paces
of
the
door
<EOS>
,
two
ladies
standing
arm
-
in
-
arm
with
their
backs
against
the
wall
,
waiting
,
as
I
imagined
,
for
a
fiacre
;
 
as
they
were
next
the
door
,
I
thought
they
had
a
prior
right
;
so
edged
myself
up
within
a
yard
or
little
more
of
them
,
and
quietly
took
my
stand
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
in
black
,
and
scarce
seen
.
  
<EOS>
The
lady
next
me
was
a
tall
lean
figure
of
a
woman
,
of
about
thirty
-
six
;
the
other
of
the
same
size
and
make
,
of
about
forty
<EOS>
:
there
was
no
mark
of
wife
or
widow
in
any
one
part
of
either
of
them
;
 
they
seem'd
to
be
two
upright
vestal
sisters
,
unsapped
by
caresses
,
unbroke
in
upon
by
tender
salutations
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
wish'd
to
have
made
them
happy
:
  
<EOS>
t
heir
happiness
was
destin'd
<EOS>
that
night
,
to
come
from
another
quarter
.
  
<EOS>
A
low
voice
,
with
a
good
turn
of
expression
,
and
sweet
cadence
at
the
end
of
it
,
begg'd
for
a
twelve
-
sous
piece
betwixt
them
,
for
the

<EOS>
I
thought
it
singular
that
a
beggar
should
fix
the
quota
of
an
alms
 
and
that
the
sum
should
be
twelve
times
as
much
as
what
is
usually
given
in
the
dark
.
 
<EOS>
They
both
seemed
astonished
at
it
as
much
as
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Twelve
sous
!
<EOS>
said
one
.
 
<EOS>
A
twelve
-
sous
piece
!
<EOS>
said
the
other
,
 
and
made
no
reply
.
  
<EOS>
The
poor
man
said
,
he
knew
not
how
to
ask
less
of
ladies
of
their
rank
;
and
bow'd
down
his
head
to
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
Poo
!
said
they
,
 
we
have
no
money
.
  
<EOS>
The
beggar
remained
silent
for
a
moment
or
two
,
and
renew'd
<EOS>
his
supplication
.
     
<EOS>
Do
not
,
my
fair
young
ladies
,
said
he
,
stop
your
good
ears
against
me
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
,
honest
man
!
<EOS>
said
the
younger
,
we
have
no
change
.
 
<EOS>
Then
God
bless
you
,
said
the
poor
man
,
and
multiply
those
joys
which
you
can
give
to
others
without
change
!
 
<EOS>
I
observed
the
elder
sister
put
her
hand
into
her
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
see
,
said
she
,
if
I
have
a
sous
.
 
<EOS>
A
sous
!
<EOS>
give
twelve
,
said
the
supplicant
;
Nature
has
been
bountiful
to
you
,
be
bountiful
to
a
poor
man
.
     
<EOS>
I
would
friend
,
with
all
my
heart
,
said
the
younger
,
if
I
had
it
.
  
<EOS>
My
fair
charitable
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
addressing
himself
to
the
elder
,
 
what
is
it
but
your
goodness
and
humanity
which
makes
your
bright
eyes
so
sweet
,
that
they
outshine
the
morning
even
in
this
dark
passage
?
<EOS>
and
what
was
it
which
made
the
Marquis
de
Santerre
and
<EOS>
his
brother
say
so
much
of
you
both
as
they
just
passed
by
?
  
<EOS>
The
two
ladies
seemed
much
affected
;
and
impulsively
,
at
the
same
time
they
both
put
their
hands
into
their
pocket
,
and
each
took
out
a
twelve
-
sous
piece
.
  
<EOS>
The
contest
betwixt
them
and
the
poor
supplicant
was
no
more
;
 
<EOS>
it
was
continued
betwixt
themselves
,
which
of
the
two
should
give
the
twelve
-
sous
piece
in
charity
;
 
and
,
to
end
the
dispute
,
they
both
gave
it
together
,
and
the
man
went
away
.
  
<EOS>
THE
RIDDLE
EXPLAINED
.
 
<EOS>
PARIS
.
  
<EOS>
I
stepped
hastily
after
him
:
 
<EOS>
it
was
the
very
man
whose
success
in
asking
charity
of
the
women
before
the
door
of
the
hotel
had
so
puzzled
me
;
 
and
<EOS>
I
found
at
once
his
secret
,
or
at
least
the
basis
of
it
:
  
'
twas
flattery
.
  
<EOS>
Delicious
essence
!
<EOS>
how
refreshing
art
thou
to
Nature
!
<EOS>
how
strongly
are
all
its
powers
and
all
its
weaknesses
on
thy
side
!
<EOS>
how
sweetly
dost
thou
mix
with
the
blood
,
and
help
it
through
the
most
difficult
and
tortuous
passages
to
the
heart
!
  
<EOS>
The
poor
man
,
as
he
was
not
straiten'd
<EOS>
for
time
,
had
given
it
here
in
a
larger
dose
:
 
'
<EOS>
tis
certain
he
had
a
way
of
bringing
it
into
a
less
form
,
for
the
many
sudden
cases
he
had
to
do
with
in
the
streets
:
 
but
how
he
contrived
to
correct
,
sweeten
,
concentre
,
and
qualify
it
,
 
<EOS>
I
vex
not
my
spirit
with
the
enquiry
;
 
<EOS>
it
is
enough
the
beggar
gained
two
twelve
-
sous
pieces
 
and
they
can
best
tell
the
rest
,
who
have
gained
much
greater
matters
by
it

We

Monsieur

merely
because
he
had
done
me
one
kindness
in
the
affair
of
my
passport
,
would
go
on
and
do
me
another
,
the
few
days
he
was
at
Paris
,
in
making
me
known
to
a
few
people
of
rank
;
and
they
were
to
present
me
to
others
,
and
so
on
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
got
master
of
my
SECRET
just
in
time
to
turn
these
honours
to
some
little
account
;
otherwise
,
as
is
commonly
the
case
,
I
should
have
dined
or
supp'd
a
single
time
or
two
round
,
and
then
,
by
TRANSLATING
French
looks
and
attitudes
into
plain
English
,
I
should
presently
have
seen
,
that
I
had
hold
of
the
couvert
{

}
of
some
more
entertaining
guest
;
and
in
course
should
have
resigned
all
my
places
one
after
another
,
merely
upon
the
principle
that
I
could
not
keep
them
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
things
did
not
go
much
amiss
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
the
honour
of
being
introduced
to
the
old
Marquis
de
B
#
#
#
#
:
 
in
days
of
yore
he
had
signalized
himself
by
some
small
feats
of
chivalry
in
the
Cour
d'Amour
,
and
had
dress'd
<EOS>
himself
out
to
the
idea
of
tilts
and
tournaments
ever
since
.
 
<EOS>
The
Marquis
de
B
<EOS>
#
#
#
#
wish'd
to
have
it
thought
the
affair
was
somewhere
else
than
in
his
brain
.
<EOS>
"
He
could
like
to
take
a
trip
to
England
,
"
and
asked
much
of
the
English
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
Stay
where
you
are

I
beseech
you

Monsieur
le
Marquis

said
I.
 
Les
Messieurs

The

invited
me
to
supper

<EOS>
Monsieur

,
the
farmer

general

was
just
as
inquisitive
about

<EOS>
They
were
very
considerable
,
he
heard
.
 
<EOS>
If
we
knew
but
how
to
collect
them
,
said
I
,
making
him
a

Madame

was
an

herself

<EOS>
she
burnt
with
impatience
to
see

hear
me
talk

<EOS>
I
had
not
taken
my
seat
,
before
I
saw
she
did
not
care
a
sous
whether
I
had
any
wit
or
no

<EOS>
I
was
let
in
,
to
be
convinced
she

I
call

I
never

to

<EOS>
There
are
three
epochas
in
the
empire
of
a
French
woman
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
coquette
,
 
then
deist
,
 
then
devote
:
 
<EOS>
the
empire
during
these
is
never
lost
,
 
she
only
changes
her
subjects
when
thirty
-
five
years
and
more
have
unpeopled
her
dominion
of
the
slaves
of
love
<EOS>
,
she
re
-
peoples
it
with
slaves
of
infidelity
,
 
and
then
with
the
slaves
of
the
church
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
de
V
#
#
#
#
was
vibrating
betwixt
<EOS>
the
first
of
those
epochas
:
 
<EOS>
the
colour
of
the
rose
was
fading
fast
away
;
 
she
ought
to
have
been
a
deist
five
years
before
the
time
I
had
the
honour
to
pay
my
first
visit
.
  
<EOS>
She
placed
me
upon
the
same
sofa
with
her
,
for
the
sake
of
disputing
the
point
of
religion
more
closely
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
Madame
de
V
#
#
#
#
told
me
she
believed
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
Madame
de
V
#
#
#
#
<EOS>
it
might
be
her
principle
,
but
I
was
sure
it
could
not
be
her
interest
to
level
the
outworks
,
without
which
I
could
not
conceive
how
such
a
citadel
as
hers
could
be
defended
;
 
that
there
was
not
a
more
dangerous
thing
in
the
world
than
for
a
beauty
to
be
a
deist
;
 
that
it
was
a
debt
I
owed
my
creed
not
to
conceal
it
from
her
;
 
that
I
had
not
been
five
minutes
sat
upon
the
sofa
beside
her
,
but
I
had
begun
to
form
designs
;
 
and
what
is
it
,
but
the
sentiments
of
religion
,
and
the
persuasion
they
had
excited
in
her
breast
,
which
could
have
check'd
them
as
they
rose
up
?
  
<EOS>
We
are
not
adamant
,
said
I
,
taking
hold
of
her
hand
;
 
and
there
is
need
of
all
restraints
,
till
age
in
her
own
time
steals
in
and
lays
them
on
us
.
 
<EOS>
But
my
dear
lady
,
said
I
,
kissing
her
hand
,
 
'
tis
too
 
too
soon
.
  
<EOS>
I
declare
I
had
the
credit
all
over
Paris
of
unperverting
Madame
de
V
#
#
#
#
.
 
<EOS>
She
affirmed
to
Monsieur
D
#
#
#
#
and
the
Abbe
M
#
#
#
#
,
that
in
one
half
hour
I
had
said
more
for
revealed
religion
,
than
all
their
Encyclopaedia
had
said
against
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
listed
directly
into
Madame
de
V
#
#
#
#
's
coterie
;
 
and
she
put
off
the
epocha
of
deism
for
two
years
.
  
<EOS>
I
remember
it
was
in
this
coterie
,
in
the
middle
of
a
discourse
,
in
which
I
was
showing
the
necessity
of
a
FIRST
cause
,
when
the
young
Count
de
Faineant
took
me
by
the
hand
to
the
farthest
corner
of
the
room
,
to
tell
me
my
solitaire
was
pinn'd
<EOS>
too
straight
about
my
neck
.
 
<EOS>
It
should
be
plus
badinant
,
said
the
Count
,
looking
down
upon
his
own
;
 
but
a
word
,
Monsieur
Yorick
,
TO
THE
WISE
     
<EOS>
And
FROM
THE
WISE
,
Monsieur
le
Count
,
replied
I
,
making
him
a
bow
,
  
-IS
ENOUGH
.
  
<EOS>
The
Count
de
Faineant
embraced
me
with
more
ardour
than
ever
I
was
embraced
by
mortal
man
.
  
<EOS>
For
three
weeks
together
<EOS>
I
was
of
every
man
's
opinion
I
met
.
  
<EOS>
Pardi

<EOS>

<EOS>
Monsieur
Yorick

said
another
.
 
<EOS>
C'est
un
bon

said
a
third
.
  
<EOS>
And
at
this
price
I
could
have
eaten
and
drank
and
been
merry
all
the
days
of
my
life
at
Paris
;
but
'
twas
a
dishonest
RECKONING
;
 
I
grew
ashamed
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
gain
of
a
slave
;
 
every
sentiment
of
honour
revolted
against
it
;
 
the
higher
I
got
,
the
more
was
I
forced
upon
my
BEGGARLY
SYSTEM
;
 
the
better
the
coterie
,
 
the
more
children
of
Art
;
 
I
<EOS>
languish'd
<EOS>
for
those
of
Nature
:
 
and
<EOS>
one
night
,
after
a
most
vile
prostitution
of
myself
to
half
a
dozen
different
people
,
I
grew
sick
,
 
went
to
bed
;
 
<EOS>
order'd
La
Fleur
to
get
me
horses
in
the
morning
to
set
out
for
Italy

I
never
felt
what
the
distress
of
plenty
was
in
any
one
shape
till
now
,
 
to
travel
it
through
the
Bourbonnois
,
the
sweetest
part
of
France
,
 
in
the
heyday
of
the
vintage
,
when
Nature
is
pouring
her
abundance
into
every
one
's
lap
,
and
every
eye
is
lifted
up
,
 
a
journey
,
through
each
step
of
which
Music
beats
time
to
Labour
,
and
all
her
children
are
rejoicing
as
they
carry
in
their
clusters
:
 
to
pass
through
this
with
my
affections
flying
out
,
and
kindling
at
every
group
before
me
,
 
and
every
one
of
them
was
pregnant
with
adventures
.
     
<EOS>
Just
heaven
!
 
<EOS>
it
would
fill
up
twenty
volumes
;
 
and
alas
!
<EOS>
I
have
but
a
few
small
pages
left
of
this
to
crowd
it
into
,
 
and
half
of
these
must
be
taken
up
with
the
poor
Maria
<EOS>
my
friend
,
Mr.
Shandy
,
met
with
near
Moulines
.
  
<EOS>
The
story
he
had
told
of
that
disordered
maid
affected
me
not
a
little
in
the
reading
;
but
when
I
got
within
the
neighbourhood
where
she
lived
,
it
returned
so
strong
into
the
mind
,
that
I
could
not
resist
an
impulse
which
prompted
me
to
go
half
a
league
out
of
the
road
,
to
the
village
where
her
parents
dwelt
,
to
enquire
after
her
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
<EOS>
going
,
I
own
,
like
the
Knight
of
the
Woeful
Countenance
in
quest
of
melancholy
adventures
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
know
not
how
it
is
,
but
I
am
never
so
perfectly
conscious
of
the
existence
of
a
soul
within
me
,
as
when
I
am
entangled
in
them
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
mother
came
to
the
door
;
her
looks
told
me
the
story
before
she
open'd
her
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
lost
her
husband
;
he
had
died
,
she
said
,
of
anguish
,
for
the
loss
of
Maria
's
senses
,
about
a
month
before
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
feared
at
first
<EOS>
,
she
added
,
that
it
would
have
plunder'd
her
poor
girl
of
what
little
understanding
was
left
;
  
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
it
had
brought
her
more
to
herself
:
  
<EOS>
s
till
,
she
could
not
rest
.
 
<EOS>
Her
poor
daughter
<EOS>
,
she
said
,
crying
,
was
wandering
somewhere
about
the
road
.
  
<EOS>
Why
does
my
pulse
beat
languid
as
I
write
this
?
<EOS>
and
what
made
La
Fleur
,
whose
heart
seem'd
only
to
be
tuned
to
joy
,
to
pass
the
back
of
his
hand
twice
across
his
eyes
,
as
the
woman
stood
and
told
it
?
<EOS>
I
beckoned
to
the
postilion
to
turn
back
into
the
road
.
  
<EOS>
When
we
had
got
within
half
a
league
of
Moulines
,
at
a
little
opening
in
the
road
leading
to
a
thicket
,
I
discovered
poor
Maria
sitting
under
a
poplar
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
sitting
with
her
elbow
in
her
lap
,
and
her
head
leaning
on
one
side
within
her
hand
:
  
<EOS>
a
 
small
brook
ran
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
.
  
<EOS>
I
bid
the
postilion
go
on
with
the
chaise
to
Moulines
 
and
La
Fleur
to
bespeak
my
supper
;
 
and
that
I
would
walk
after
him
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
dress'd
in
white
,
and
much
as
my
friend
described
her
,
except
that
her
hair
hung
loose
,
which
before
was
twisted
within
a
silk
net
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
superadded
likewise
to
her
jacket
,
a
pale
green
riband
,
which
fell
across
her
shoulder
to
the
waist
;
at
the
end
of
which
hung
her
pipe
.
 
<EOS>
Her
goat
had
been
as
faithless
as
her
lover
;
and
she
had
got
a
little
dog
in
lieu
of
him
,
which
she
had
kept
tied
by
a
string
to
her
girdle
:
 
as
I
looked
at
her
dog
<EOS>
,
she
drew
him
towards
her
with
the
string
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
shalt
not
leave
me
,
Sylvio
,
"
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
I
look'd
in
Maria
's
eyes
and
saw
she
was
thinking
more
of
her
father
than
of
her
lover
,
or
her
little
goat
;
for
,
as
she
utter'd
them
,
the
tears
trickled
down
her
cheeks
.
  
<EOS>
I
sat
down
close
by
her
;
and
Maria
let
me
wipe
them
away
as
they
fell
,
with
my
handkerchief
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
steep'd
<EOS>
it
in
my
own
,
 
and
then
in
hers
,
 
and
then
in
mine
,
 
<EOS>
and
then
I
<EOS>
wip'd
hers
again
;
 
<EOS>
and
as
I
did
it
,
I
felt
such
undescribable
emotions
within
me
,
as
I
am
sure
could
not
be
accounted
for
from
any
combinations
of
matter
and
motion
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
positive
I
have
a
soul
;
nor
can
all
the
books
with
which
materialists
have
pester'd
<EOS>
the
world
ever
convince
me
to
the
contrary
.
  
<EOS>
MARIA
.
  
<EOS>
When
Maria
had
come
a
little
to
herself
,
I
ask'd
her
if
she
remembered
a
pale
thin
person
of
a
man
,
who
had
sat
down
betwixt
her
and
her
goat
about
two
years
before
?
 
<EOS>
She
said
she
was
unsettled
much
at
that
time
,
but
remembered
it
upon
two
accounts
:
   
<EOS>
-that
<EOS>
ill
as
she
was
<EOS>
,
she
saw
the
person
pitied
her
;
and
next
,
that
her
goat
had
stolen
his
handkerchief
,
and
she
had
beat
him
for
the
theft
;
 
<EOS>
she
had
wash'd
<EOS>
it
<EOS>
,
she
said
,
in
the
brook
,
and
kept
it
ever
since
in
her
pocket
to
restore
it
to
him
in
case
she
should
ever
see
him
again
,
which
,
she
added
,
he
had
half
promised
her
.
 
<EOS>
As
she
told
me
this
,
she
took
the
handkerchief
out
of
her
pocket
to
let
me
see
it
;
she
had
folded
it
up
neatly
in
a
couple
of
vine
leaves
,
tied
round
with
a
tendril
;
 
on
opening
it
<EOS>
,
I
saw
an
S.
marked
in
one
of
the
corners
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
since
that
,
she
told
me
,
stray'd
as
far
as
Rome
,
and
walk'd
round
<EOS>
St.
Peter
's
once
,
 
and
return'd
back
;
 
that
she
found
her
way
alone
across
the
Apennines
;
 
had
travell'd
over
all
Lombardy
,
without
money
,
 
and
through
the
flinty
roads
of
Savoy
without
shoes
:
  
<EOS>
h
ow
she
had
borne
it
,
and
how
she
had
got
supported
,
she
could
not
tell
;
 
but
GOD
TEMPERS
THE
WIND
,
said
Maria
,
TO
THE
SHORN
LAMB
.
  
<EOS>
Shorn
indeed
!
<EOS>
and
to
the
quick
,
said
I
:
 
and
wast
thou
in
my
own
land
,
where
I
have
a
cottage
,
I
would
take
thee
to
it
,
and
shelter
thee
:
 
<EOS>
thou
shouldst
eat
of
my
own
bread
and
drink
of
my
own
cup
;
  
<EOS>
I
would
be
kind
to
thy
Sylvio
;
 
in
all
thy
weaknesses
and
wanderings
<EOS>
I
would
seek
after
thee
and
bring
thee
back
;
 
when
the
sun
went
down
I
would
say
my
prayers
:
 
and
when
I
had
done
thou
shouldst
play
thy
evening
song
upon
thy
pipe
,
nor
would
the
incense
of
my
sacrifice
be
worse
accepted
for
entering
heaven
along
with
that
of
a
broken
heart
!
  
<EOS>
Nature
melted
within
me
,
as
I
utter'd
this
;
and
Maria
observing
,
as
I
took
out
my
handkerchief
,
that
it
was
steep'd
too
much
already
to
be
of
use
,
would
needs
go
wash
it
in
the
stream
.
 
<EOS>
And
where
will
you
dry
it
,
Maria
?
<EOS>
said
I.
 
I
'll
dry
it
in
my
bosom
,
said
she
:
   
'
twill
do
me
good
.
  
<EOS>
And
is
your
heart
still
so
warm
,
Maria
?
<EOS>
said
I.
  
I
touch'd
<EOS>
upon
the
string
on
which
hung
all
her
sorrows
:
  
<EOS>
s
he
look'd
<EOS>
with
wistful
disorder
for
some
time
in
my
face
;
and
then
,
without
saying
any
thing
,
took
her
pipe
and
play'd
<EOS>
her
service
to
the
Virgin
.
 
<EOS>
The
string
I
had
touched
ceased
to
vibrate
;
 
in
a
moment
or
two
Maria
returned
to
herself
,
 
<EOS>
let
her
pipe
fall
,
 
and
rose
up
.
  
<EOS>
And
where
are
you
going
,
Maria
?
<EOS>
said
<EOS>
I.
 
She
said
,
to
Moulines
.
  
<EOS>
Let
us
go
,
said
I
,
together
.
 
<EOS>
Maria
put
her
arm
within
mine
,
and
lengthening
the
string
,
to
let
the
dog
follow
,
 
in
that
order
<EOS>
we
enter'd
<EOS>
Moulines
.
  
<EOS>
MARIA
.
 
<EOS>
MOULINES
.
  
<EOS>
Though
I
hate
salutations
and
greetings
in
the
market
-
place
,
yet
,
when
we
got
into
the
middle
of
this
,
I
stopp'd
<EOS>
to
take
my
last
look
and
last
farewell
of
Maria
.
  
<EOS>
Maria
,
though
not
tall
,
was
nevertheless
of
the
first
order
of
fine
forms
:
  
<EOS>
a
ffliction
had
touched
her
looks
with
something
that
was
scarce
earthly
;
 
still
she
was
feminine
;
 
and
so
much
was
there
about
her
of
all
that
the
heart
wishes
,
or
the
eye
looks
for
in
woman
,
that
could
the
traces
be
ever
worn
out
of
her
brain
,
and
those
of
Eliza
out
of
mine
,
she
should
NOT
ONLY
EAT
OF
MY
BREAD
AND
DRINK
OF
MY
OWN
CUP
,
but
Maria
should
lie
in
my
bosom
,
and
be
unto
me
as
a
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
Adieu
,
poor
luckless
maiden
!
 
<EOS>
Imbibe
the
oil
and
wine
which
the
compassion
of
a
stranger
,
as
he
journeyeth
on
his
way
,
now
pours
into
thy
wounds
;
 
the
Being
,
who
has
twice
bruised
thee
,
can
only
bind
them
up
for
ever
.

THE
BOURBONNNOIS
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
from
which
I
had
painted
out
for
my
self
<EOS>
so
joyous
a
riot
of
the
affections
,
as
in
this
journey
in
the
vintage
,
through
this
part
of
France
;
but
pressing
through
this
gate
,
of
sorrow
to
it
,
my
sufferings
have
totally
unfitted
me
.
 
<EOS>
In
every
scene
of
festivity
,
I
saw
Maria
in
the
background
of
the
piece
,
sitting
pensive
under
her
poplar
;
and
I
had
got
almost
to
Lyons
before
I
was
able
to
cast
a
shade
across
her
.
     
<EOS>
Dear
Sensibility
!
<EOS>
source
inexhausted
of
all
that
's
precious
in
our
joys
,
or
costly
in
our
sorrows
!
<EOS>
thou
chainest
thy
martyr
down
upon
his
bed
of
straw
 
and
'
tis
thou
who
lift'st
him
up
to
Heaven
!
 
<EOS>
Eternal
Fountain
of
our
feelings
!
 
<EOS>
'

here
<EOS>
I
trace
thee
 
<EOS>
and
this
is
thy
"
DIVINITY
<EOS>
WHICH
STIRS
WITHIN
ME
;
"
 
not
that
,
in
some
sad
and
sickening
moments
,
"
MY
SOUL
SHRINKS
BACK
UPON
HERSELF
,
AND
STARTLES
AT
DESTRUCTION
;
"
 
mere
pomp
of
words
!
 
<EOS>
but
that
I
feel
some
generous
joys
and
generous
cares
beyond
myself
;
 
<EOS>
all
comes
from
thee
,
great
 
great
SENSORIUM
of
the
world
!
<EOS>
which
vibrates
,
if
a
hair
of
our
heads
but
falls
upon
the
ground
,
in
the
remotest
desert
of
thy
creation
.
 
<EOS>
Touch'd
with
thee
,
Eugenius
draws
my
curtain
when
I
languish
 
hears
my
tale
of
symptoms
,
and
blames
the
weather
for
the
disorder
of
his
nerves
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
giv'st
<EOS>
a
portion
of
it
sometimes
to
the
roughest
peasant
who
traverses
the
bleakest
mountains
;
 
<EOS>
he
finds
the
lacerated
lamb
of
another
's
flock
.
 
<EOS>
This
moment
I
behold
him
leaning
with
his
head
against
his
crook
,
with
piteous
inclination
looking
down
upon
it
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
had
I
come
one
moment
sooner
!
<EOS>
it
bleeds
to
death
!
 
<EOS>
his
gentle
heart
bleeds
with
it
.
     
<EOS>
Peace
to
thee
,
generous
swain
!
 
<EOS>
I
see
thou
walkest
off
with
anguish
,
 
but
<EOS>
thy
joys
shall
balance
it
;
 
for
,
happy
is
thy
cottage
,
 
and
happy
<EOS>
is
the
sharer
of
it

and
happy
are
the
lambs
which

THE
SUPPER
.
  
<EOS>
A
shoe
coming
loose
from
the
fore
foot
of
the
thill
-
horse
,
at
the
beginning
of
the
ascent
of
mount
Taurira
,
the
postilion
dismounted
,
twisted
the
shoe
off
,
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
;
as
the
ascent
was
of
five
or
six
miles
,
and
that
horse
our
main
dependence
,
I
made
a
point
of
having
the
shoe
fastened
on
again
,
as
well
as
we
could
;
but
the
postilion
had
thrown
away
the
nails
,
and
the
hammer
in
the
chaise
box
being
of
no
great
use
without
them
,
I
submitted
to
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
not
mounted
half
a
mile
higher
,
when
,
coming
to
a
flinty
piece
of
road
,
the
poor
devil
lost
a
second
shoe
,
and
from
off
his
other
fore
foot
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
got
out
of
the
chaise
in
good
earnest
;
and
seeing
a
house
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
the
left
hand
,
<EOS>
with
a
great
deal
to
do
I
prevailed
upon
the
postilion
to
turn
up
to
it
.
<EOS>
The
look
of
the
house
,
and
of
every
thing
about
it
,
as
we
drew
nearer
,
soon
reconciled
me
to
the
disaster
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
little
farm
-
house
,
surrounded
with
about
twenty
acres
of
vineyard
,
about
as
much
corn
;
 
and
close
to
the
house
,
on
one
side
,
<EOS>
was
a
potagerie
of
an
acre
and
a
half
,
full
of
everything
which
could
make
plenty
in
a
French
peasant
's
house
;
 
and
,
on
the
other
side
,
was
a
little
wood
,
which
furnished
wherewithal
to
dress
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
about
eight
in
the
evening
when
I
got
to
the
house
 
<EOS>
so
I
left
the
postilion
to
manage
his
point
as
he
could
;
 
and
,
for
mine
,
I
walked
directly
into
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
The
family
consisted
of
an
old
grey
-
headed
man
and
his
wife
,
with
five
or
six
sons
and
sons
-
in
-
law
,
and
their
several
wives
,
and
a
joyous
genealogy
out
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
all
sitting
down
together
to
their
lentil
-
soup
;
a
large
wheaten
loaf
was
in
the
middle
of
the
table
;
and
a
flagon
of
wine
at
each
end
of
it
promised
joy
through
the
stages
of
the
repast
:
   
<EOS>
'
twas
a
feast
of
love
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
man
rose
up
to
meet
me
,
and
with
a
respectful
cordiality
would
have
me
sit
down
at
the
table
;
my
heart
was
set
down
the
moment
<EOS>
I
enter'd
<EOS>
the
room
;
so
I
sat
down
at
once
like
a
son
of
the
family
;
and
to
invest
myself
in
the
character
as
speedily
as
I
could
,
I
instantly
borrowed
the
old
man
's
knife
,
and
taking
up
the
loaf
,
cut
myself
a
hearty
luncheon
;
and
,
as
I
did
it
,
I
saw
a
testimony
in
every
eye
,
not
only
of
an
honest
welcome
,
but
of
a
welcome
mix'd
with
thanks
that
I
had
not
seem'd
to
doubt
it
.
  
<EOS>
Was
it
this
?
<EOS>
or
tell
me
,
Nature
,
what
else
it
was
that
made
this
morsel
so
sweet
,
 
and
to
what
magic
<EOS>
I
owe
it
,
that
the
draught
I
took
of
their
flagon
was
so
delicious
with
it
,
that
they
remain
upon
my
palate
to
this
hour
?
  
<EOS>
If
the
supper
was
to
my
taste
,
 
the
grace
which
followed
it
was
much
more
so
.
  
<EOS>
THE
GRACE
.
  
<EOS>
When
supper
was
over
,
the
old
man
gave
a
knock
upon
the
table
with
the
haft
of
his
knife
,
to
bid
them
prepare
for
the
dance
:
 
<EOS>
the
moment
the
signal
was
given
,
the
women
and
girls
ran
altogether
into
a
back
apartment
to
tie
up
their
hair
,
 
and
the
young
men
to
the
door
to
wash
their
faces
,
and
change
their
sabots
;
and
in
three
minutes
every
soul
was
ready
upon
a
little
esplanade
before
the
house
to
begin
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
man
and
his
wife
came
out
last
,
and
placing
me
betwixt
them
,
sat
down
upon
a
sofa
of
turf
by
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
man
had
some
fifty
years
ago
been
no
mean
performer
upon
the
vielle
,
 
and
at
the
age
he
was
then
of
,
touch'd
<EOS>
it
well
enough
for
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
His
wife
sung
now
<EOS>
and
then
a
little
to
the
tune
,
  
<EOS>
-then
intermitted
,
 
and
join'd
<EOS>
her
old
man
again
,
as
their
children
and
grand
-
children
danced
before
them
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
till
the
middle
of
the
second
dance
,
when
,
from
some
pauses
in
the
movements
,
wherein
they
all
seemed
to
look
up
,
I
fancied
I
could
distinguish
an
elevation
of
spirit
different
from
that
which
is
the
cause
or
the
effect
of
simple
jollity
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
I
thought
I
beheld
Religion
mixing
in
the
dance
:
  
<EOS>
b
<EOS>
ut
,
as
I
had
never
seen
her
so
engaged
,
I
should
have
look'd
<EOS>
upon
it
now
as
one
of
the
illusions
of
an
imagination
which
is
eternally
misleading
me
,
had
not
the
old
man
,
as
soon
as
the
dance
ended
,
said
,
that
this
was
their
constant
way
;
and
that
all
his
life
long
<EOS>
he
had
made
it
a
rule
,
after
supper
was
over
,
to
call
out
his
family
to
dance
and
rejoice
;
believing
,
he
said
,
that
a
cheerful
and
contented
mind
was
the
best
sort
of
thanks
to
heaven
that
an
illiterate
peasant
could
pay
,
     
Or
a
learned
prelate
either
,

THE
CASE
OF
DELICACY
.
  
<EOS>
When
you
have
gained
the
top
of
Mount
Taurira
,
you
run
presently
down
to
Lyons
:
  
a
dieu
,
then
,
to
all
rapid
movements
!
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
a
journey
of
caution
;
and
it
fares
better
with
sentiments
,
not
to
be
in
a
hurry
with
them
;
so
I
contracted
with
a
voiturin
to
take
his
time
with
a
couple
of
mules
,
and
convoy
me
in
my
own
chaise
safe
to
Turin
,
through
Savoy
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
,
patient
,
quiet
,
honest
people
!
<EOS>
fear
not
:
 
your
poverty
,
the
treasury
of
your
simple
virtues
,
will
not
be
envied
you
by
the
world
,
nor
will
your
valleys
be
invaded
by
it
.
 
<EOS>
Nature
!
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
thy
disorders
,
thou
art
still
friendly
to
the
scantiness
thou
hast
created
:
 
with
all
thy
great
works
about
thee
,
little
hast
thou
left
to
give
,
either
to
the
scythe
or
to
the
sickle
;
 
but
to
that
little
thou
grantest
safety
and
protection
;
and
sweet
are
the
dwellings
which
stand
so
shelter'd
.
  
<EOS>
Let
the
way
-
worn
traveller
vent
his
complaints
upon
the
sudden
turns
and
dangers
of
your
roads
,
 
<EOS>
your
rocks
,
 
your
precipices
;
  
the
difficulties
of
getting
up
,
 
the
horrors
of
getting
down
,
  
mountains
impracticable
,
 
and
cataracts
,
which
roll
down
great
stones
from
their
summits
,
and
block
his
road
up
.
 
<EOS>
The
peasants
had
been
all
day
at
work
in
removing
a
fragment
of
this
kind
between
St.
Michael
and
Madane
;
and
,
by
the
time
my
voiturin
got
to
the
place
,
it
wanted
full
two
hours
of
completing
before
a
passage
could
any
how
be
gain'd
:
 
<EOS>
there
was
nothing
but
to
wait
with
patience
;
 
'
twas
a
wet
and
tempestuous
night
;
so
that
by
the
delay
,
and
that
together
,
the
voiturin
found
himself
obliged
to
put
up
five
miles
short
of
his
stage
at
a
little
decent
kind
of
an
inn
by
the
roadside
.
  
<EOS>
I
forthwith
took
possession
of
my
bedchamber
 
<EOS>
got
a
good
fire
 
<EOS>
order'd
supper
;
and
was
thanking
heaven
<EOS>
it
was
no
worse
,
when
a
voiture
arrived
with
a
lady
in
it
and
her
servant
maid
.
  
<EOS>
As
there
was
no
other
bed
-
chamber
in
the
house
,
the
hostess
,
  
without
much
nicety
,
led
them
into
mine
,
telling
them
,
as
she
usher'd
<EOS>
them
in
,
that
there
was
nobody
in
it
but
an
English
gentleman
;
 
that
there
were
two
good
beds
in
it
,
and
a
closet
within
the
room
which
held
another
.
 
<EOS>
The
accent
in
which
she
spoke
of
this
third
bed
,
did
not
say
much
for
it
;
 
however
,
she
said
there
were
three
beds
<EOS>
and
<EOS>
but
three
people
,
and
<EOS>
she
durst
say
,
the
gentleman
would
do
anything
to
accommodate
matters
.
 
<EOS>
I
left
not
the
lady
a
moment
to
make
a
conjecture
about
it
 
so
instantly
made
a
declaration
that
I
would
do
anything
in
my
power
.
  
<EOS>
As
this
did
not
amount
to
an
absolute
surrender
of
my
bed
-
chamber
,
I
still
felt
myself
so
much
the
proprietor
,
as
to
have
a
right
to
do
the
honours
of
it
;
 
<EOS>
so
I
desired
the
lady
to
sit
down
,
 
pressed
her
into
the
warmest
seat
,
 
called
for
more
wood
,
 
desired
the
hostess
to
enlarge
the
plan
of
the
supper
,
and
to
favour
us
with
the
very
best
wine
.
  
<EOS>
The
lady
had
scarce
warm'd
herself
five
minutes
at
the
fire
,
before
she
began
to
turn
her
head
back
,
and
give
a
look
at
the
beds
;
and
the
oftener
she
cast
her
eyes
that
way
,
the
more
they
return'd
perplexd
;
 
<EOS>
I
felt
for
her
 
and
for
myself
:
 
for
in
a
few
minutes
<EOS>
,
what
by
her
looks
,
and
the
case
itself
,
I
found
myself
as
much
embarrassed
as
it
was
possible
the
lady
could
be
herself
.
  
<EOS>
That
the
beds
we
were
to
lie
in
were
in
one
and
the
same
room
,
was
enough
simply
by
itself
to
have
excited
all
this
;
 
but
the
position
of
them
,
for
they
stood
parallel
,
and
so
very
close
to
each
other
as
only
to
allow
space
for
a
small
wicker
chair
betwixt
them
,
rendered
the
affair
still
more
oppressive
to
us
;
 
they
were
fixed
up
moreover
near
the
fire
;
and
the
projection
of
the
chimney
on
one
side
,
and
a
large
beam
<EOS>
which
cross'd
<EOS>
the
room
on
the
other
,
formed
a
kind
of
recess
for
them
that
was
no
way
favourable
to
the
nicety
of
our
sensations
:
  
<EOS>
i
f
<EOS>
anything
could
have
added
to
it
<EOS>
,
it
was
that
the
two
beds
were
both
of
them
so
very
small
,
as
to
cut
us
off
from
every
idea
of
the
lady
and
the
maid
lying
together
;
which
in
either
of
them
,
could
it
have
been
feasible
,
my
lying
beside
them
,
though
a
thing
not
to
be
wish'd
,
yet
there
was
nothing
in
it
<EOS>
so
terrible
which
the
imagination
might
not
have
pass'd
over
without
torment
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
the
little
room
within
,
it
offer'd
<EOS>
little
or
no
consolation
to
us
:
 
'
twas
a
damp
,
cold
closet
,
with
a
half
dismantled
window
-
shutter
,
and
with
a
window
which
had
neither
glass
nor
oil
paper
in
it
to
keep
out
the
tempest
of
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
endeavour
to
stifle
my
cough
when
the
lady
gave
a
peep
into
it
;
so
it
reduced
the
case
in
course
to
this
alternative
 
<EOS>
That
the
lady
should
sacrifice
her
health
to
her
feelings
,
and
take
up
with
the
closet
herself
,
and
abandon
the
bed
next
mine
to
her
maid
,
 
or
that
the
girl
should
take
the
closet
,
&
c.
,
&
c.
  
<EOS>
The
lady
was
a
Piedmontese
of
about
thirty
,
with
a
glow
of
health
in
her
cheeks
.
 
<EOS>
The
maid
was
a
Lyonoise
of
twenty
,
and
as
brisk
and
lively
a
French
girl
as
ever
moved
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
difficulties
every
way
,
 
and
the
obstacle
of
the
stone
in
the
road
,
which
brought
us
into
the
distress
,
great
as
it
appeared
whilst
the
peasants
were
removing
it
,
was
but
a
pebble
to
what
lay
in
our
ways
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
only
to
add
,
that
it
did
not
lessen
the
weight
which
hung
upon
our
spirits
,
that
we
were
both
too
delicate
to
communicate
what
we
felt
to
each
other
upon
the
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
We
sat
down
to
supper
;
and
had
we
not
had
more
generous
wine
to
it
than
a
little
inn
in
Savoy
could
have
furnish'd
,
our
tongues
had
been
tied
up
,
till
necessity
herself
had
set
them
at
liberty
;
 
but
the
lady
having
a
few
bottles
of
Burgundy
in
her
voiture
,
sent
down
her
fille
de
chambre
for
a
couple
of
them
;
so
that
by
the
time
supper
was
over
,
and
we
were
left
alone
<EOS>
,
we
felt
ourselves
inspired
with
a
strength
of
mind
sufficient
to
talk
,
at
least
,
without
reserve
upon
our
situation
.
 
<EOS>
We
turn'd
<EOS>
it
every
way
,
and
debated
and
considered
it
in
all
kinds
of
lights
in
the
course
of
a
two
hours
'
negotiation
;
at
the
end
of
which
the
articles
were
settled
finally
betwixt
us
,
and
stipulated
for
in
form
and
manner
of
a
treaty
of
peace
,
 
and
I
believe
with
as
much
religion
and
good
faith
on
both
sides
as
in
any
treaty
which
has
yet
had
the
honour
of
being
handed
down
to
posterity
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
as
follow
:
      
<EOS>
First
,
as
the
right
of
the
bed
-
chamber
is
in
Monsieur
,
 
and
he
thinking
the
bed
next
to
the
fire
to
be
the
warmest
,
he
insists
upon
the
concession
on
the
lady
's
side
of
taking
up
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
Granted
,
on
the
part
of
Madame
;
with
a
proviso
,
That
as
the
curtains
of
that
bed
are
of
a
flimsy
transparent
cotton
,
and
appear
likewise
too
scanty
to
draw
close
,
that
the
fille
de
chambre
shall
fasten
up
the
opening
,
either
by
corking
pins
,
or
needle
and
thread
,
in
such
manner
as
shall
be
deem'd
a
sufficient
barrier
on
the
side
of
Monsieur
.
  
<EOS>
2dly
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
required
on
the
part
of
Madame
,
that
Monsieur
shall
lie
the
whole
night
through
in
his
robe
de
chambre
.
  
<EOS>
Rejected
:
 
inasmuch
as
Monsieur
is
not
worth
a
robe
de
chambre
<EOS>
;
he
having
nothing
in
his
portmanteau
but
six
shirts
and
a
black
silk
pair
of
breeches
.
  
<EOS>
The
mentioning
the
silk
pair
of
breeches
made
an
entire
change
of
the
article
,
 
for
the
breeches
were
accepted
as
an
equivalent
for
the
robe
de
chambre
;
and
so
it
was
stipulated
and
agreed
upon
,
that
I
should
lie
in
my
black
silk
breeches
all
night
.
  
<EOS>
3dly
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
insisted
upon
and
stipulated
for
by
the
lady
,
that
after
Monsieur
was
got
to
bed
,
and
the
candle
and
fire
extinguished
,
that
Monsieur
should
not
speak
one
single
word
the
whole
night
.
  
<EOS>
Granted
;
provided
Monsieur
's
saying
his
prayers
might
not
be
deemed
an
infraction
of
the
treaty
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
but
one
point
forgot
in
this
treaty
,
and
that
was
the
manner
in
which
the
lady
and
myself
should
be
obliged
to
undress
and
get
to
bed
;
 
there
was
but
one
way
of
doing
it
,
and
that
I
leave
to
the
reader
to
devise
;
protesting
as
I
do
it
,
that
if
it
is
not
the
most
delicate
in
nature
,
'
tis
the
fault
of
his
own
imagination
,
 
against
which
this
is
not
my
first
complaint
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
when
we
were
got
to
bed
,
whether
it
was
the
novelty
of
the
situation
,
or
what
it
was
,
I
know
not
;
but
so
it
was
,
<EOS>
I
could
not
shut
my
eyes
;
I
tried
this
side
,
and
that
,
and
turn'd
and
turn'd
again
,
till
a
full
hour
after
midnight
;
when
Nature
and
patience
both
wearing
out
,
 
O
,
my
God
!
said
I.
     
You
have
broke
the
treaty
,
Monsieur
,
said
the
lady
,
who
had
no
more
slept
than
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
begg'd
<EOS>
a
thousand
pardons
 
<EOS>
but
insisted
it
was
no
more
than
an
ejaculation
.
 
<EOS>
She
maintained
'
twas
an
entire
infraction
of
the
treaty
 
I
maintained
it
was
provided
for
in
the
clause
of
the
third
article
.
  
<EOS>
The
lady
would
by
no
means
give
up
her
point
,
though
she
weaken'd
<EOS>
her
barrier
by
it
;
for
in
the
warmth
of
the
dispute
,
I
could
hear
two
or
three
corking
pins
fall
out
of
the
curtain
to
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
and
honour
,
Madame
,
said
I
,
 
stretching
my
arm
out
of
bed
by
way
of
asseveration
.
     
<EOS>
(
I
was
going
to
have
added
,
that
I
would
not
have
trespassed
against
the
remotest
idea
of
decorum
for
the
world
)
;
     
<EOS>
But
the
fille
de
chambre
hearing
<EOS>
there
were
words
between
us
,
and
fearing
that
hostilities
would
ensue
in
course
,
had
crept
silently
out
of
her
closet
,
and
it
being
totally
dark
,
had
stolen
so
close
to
our
beds
,
that
she
had
got
herself
into
the
narrow
passage
which
separated
them
,
and
had
advanced
so
far
up
as
to
be
in
a
line
betwixt
her
mistress
and
me
:
      
<EOS>
So
that
when
I
<EOS>
stretch'd
out
my
hand
<EOS>
I
caught
hold
of
the
fille
de
chambre
's
    
<EOS>
