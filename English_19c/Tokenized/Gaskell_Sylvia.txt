   
MONKSHAVEN
  
<EOS>
On
the
north
-
eastern
shores
of
England
there
is
a
town
called
Monkshaven
,
containing
at
the
present
day
about
fifteen
thousand
inhabitants
.
<EOS>
There
were
,
however
,
but
half
the
number
at
the
end
of
the
last
century
,
and
it
was
at
that
period
that
the
events
narrated
in
the
following
pages
occurred
.
  
<EOS>
Monkshaven
was
a
name
not
unknown
in
the
history
of
England
,
and
traditions
of
its
having
been
the
landing
-
place
of
a
throneless
queen
were
current
in
the
town
.
<EOS>
At
that
time
there
had
been
a
fortified
castle
on
the
heights
above
it
,
the
site
of
which
was
now
occupied
by
a
deserted
manor
-
house
;
and
at
an
even
earlier
date
than
the
arrival
of
the
queen
and
coeval
with
the
most
ancient
remains
of
the
castle
,
a
great
monastery
had
stood
on
those
cliffs
,
overlooking
the
vast
ocean
that
blended
with
the
distant
sky
.
<EOS>
Monkshaven
itself
was
built
by
the
side
of
the
Dee
,
just
where
the
river
falls
into
the
German
Ocean
.
<EOS>
The
principal
street
of
the
town
ran
parallel
to
the
stream
,
and
smaller
lanes
branched
out
of
this
,
and
straggled
up
the
sides
of
the
steep
hill
,
between
which
and
the
river
<EOS>
the
houses
were
pent
in
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
bridge
across
the
Dee
,
and
consequently
a
Bridge
Street
running
at
right
angles
to
the
High
Street
;
and
on
the
south
side
of
the
stream
there
were
a
few
houses
of
more
pretension
,
around
which
lay
gardens
and
fields
.
<EOS>
It
was
on
this
side
of
the
town
that
the
local
aristocracy
lived
.
<EOS>
And
who
were
the
great
people
of
this
small
town
?
<EOS>
Not
the
younger
branches
of
the
county
families
that
held
hereditary
state
in
their
manor
-
houses
on
the
wild
bleak
moors
,
that
shut
in
Monkshaven
almost
as
effectually
on
the
land
side
as
ever
<EOS>
the
waters
did
on
the
sea
-
board
.
<EOS>
No
;
these
old
families
kept
aloof
from
the
unsavoury
yet
adventurous
trade
which
brought
wealth
to
generation
after
generation
of
certain
families
in
Monkshaven
.
  
<EOS>
The
magnates
of
Monkshaven
were
those
who
had
the
largest
number
of
ships
engaged
in
the
whaling
-
trade
.
<EOS>
Something
like
the
following
was
the
course
of
life
with
a
Monkshaven
lad
of
this
class
:
 
<EOS>
He
was
apprenticed
as
a
sailor
to
one
of
the
great
ship
-
owners
 
to
his
own
father
,
possibly
 
along
with
twenty
other
boys
,
or
,
it
might
be
,
even
more
.
<EOS>
During
the
summer
months
he
and
his
fellow
apprentices
made
voyages
to
the
Greenland
seas
,
returning
with
their
cargoes
in
the
early
autumn
;
and
employing
the
winter
months
in
watching
the
preparation
of
the
oil
from
the
blubber
in
the
melting
-
sheds
,
and
learning
navigation
from
some
quaint
but
experienced
teacher
,
half
schoolmaster
,
half
sailor
,
who
seasoned
his
instructions
by
stirring
narrations
of
the
wild
adventures
of
his
youth
.
<EOS>
The
house
of
the
ship
-
owner
to
whom
he
was
apprenticed
was
his
home
and
that
of
his
companions
during
the
idle
season
between
October
and
March
.
<EOS>
The
domestic
position
of
these
boys
varied
according
to
the
premium
paid
;
some
took
rank
with
the
sons
of
the
family
,
others
were
considered
as
little
better
than
servants
.
<EOS>
Yet
once
on
board
an
equality
prevailed
,
in
which
,
if
any
claimed
superiority
,
it
was
the
bravest
and
brightest
.
<EOS>
After
a
certain
number
of
voyages
the
Monkshaven
lad
would
rise
by
degrees
to
be
captain
,
and
as
such
would
have
a
share
in
the
venture
;
all
these
profits
,
as
well
as
all
his
savings
,
would
go
towards
building
a
whaling
vessel
of
his
own
,
if
he
was
not
so
fortunate
as
to
be
the
child
of
a
ship
-
owner
.
<EOS>
At
the
time
of
which
I
write
,
there
was
but
little
division
of
labour
in
the
Monkshaven
whale
fishery
.
<EOS>
The
same
man
might
be
the
owner
of
six
or
seven
ships
,
any
one
of
which
he
himself
was
fitted
by
education
and
experience
to
command
;
the
master
of
a
score
of
apprentices
,
each
of
whom
paid
a
pretty
sufficient
premium
;
and
the
proprietor
of
the
melting
-
sheds
into
which
his
cargoes
of
blubber
and
whalebone
were
conveyed
to
be
fitted
for
sale
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
wonder
that
large
fortunes
were
acquired
by
these
ship
-
owners
,
nor
that
their
houses
on
the
south
side
of
the
river
Dee
were
stately
mansions
,
full
of
handsome
and
substantial
furniture
.
<EOS>
It
was
also
not
surprising
that
the
whole
town
had
an
amphibious
appearance
,
to
a
degree
unusual
even
in
a
seaport
.
<EOS>
Every
one
depended
on
the
whale
fishery
,
and
almost
every
male
inhabitant
had
been
,
or
hoped
to
be
,
a
sailor
.
<EOS>
Down
by
the
river
the
smell
was
almost
intolerable
to
any
but
Monkshaven
people
during
certain
seasons
of
the
year
;
but
on
these
unsavoury
"
staithes
"
the
old
men
and
children
lounged
for
hours
,
almost
as
if
they
revelled
in
the
odours
of
train
-
oil
.
  
<EOS>
This
is
,
perhaps
,
enough
of
a
description
of
the
town
itself
.
<EOS>
I
have
said
that
the
country
for
miles
all
around
was
moorland
;
high
above
the
level
of
the
sea
<EOS>
towered
the
purple
crags
,
whose
summits
were
crowned
with
greensward
that
stole
down
the
sides
of
the
scaur
a
little
way
in
grassy
veins
.
<EOS>
Here
and
there
a
brook
forced
its
way
from
the
heights
down
to
the
sea
,
making
its
channel
into
a
valley
more
or
less
broad
in
long
process
of
time
.
<EOS>
And
in
the
moorland
hollows
,
as
in
these
valleys
,
trees
and
underwood
grew
and
flourished
;
so
that
,
while
on
the
bare
swells
of
the
high
land
you
shivered
at
the
waste
desolation
of
the
scenery
,
when
you
dropped
into
these
wooded
"
bottoms
"
you
were
charmed
with
the
nestling
shelter
which
they
gave
.
<EOS>
But
above
and
around
these
rare
and
fertile
vales
there
were
moors
for
many
a
mile
,
here
<EOS>
and
there
bleak
enough
,
with
the
red
freestone
cropping
out
above
the
scanty
herbage
;
then
,
perhaps
,
there
was
a
brown
tract
of
peat
and
bog
,
uncertain
footing
for
the
pedestrian
who
tried
to
make
a
short
cut
to
his
destination
;
then
on
the
higher
sandy
soil
there
was
the
purple
ling
,
or
commonest
species
of
heather
growing
in
beautiful
wild
luxuriance
.
<EOS>
Tufts
of
fine
elastic
grass
were
occasionally
to
be
found
,
on
which
the
little
black
-
faced
sheep
browsed
;
but
either
the
scanty
food
,
or
their
goat
-
like
agility
,
kept
them
in
a
lean
condition
that
did
not
promise
much
for
the
butcher
,
nor
yet
was
their
wool
of
a
quality
fine
enough
to
make
them
profitable
in
that
way
to
their
owners
.
<EOS>
In
such
districts
there
is
little
population
at
the
present
day
;
there
was
much
less
in
the
last
century
,
before
agriculture
was
sufficiently
scientific
to
have
a
chance
of
contending
with
such
natural
disqualifications
as
the
moors
presented
,
and
when
there
were
no
facilities
of
railroads
to
bring
sportsmen
from
a
distance
to
enjoy
the
shooting
season
,
and
make
an
annual
demand
for
accommodation
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
old
stone
halls
in
the
valleys
;
there
were
bare
farmhouses
to
be
seen
on
the
moors
at
long
distances
apart
,
with
small
stacks
of
coarse
poor
hay
,
and
almost
larger
stacks
of
turf
for
winter
fuel
in
their
farmyards
.
<EOS>
The
cattle
in
the
pasture
fields
belonging
to
these
farms
looked
half
starved
;
but
somehow
there
was
an
odd
,
intelligent
expression
in
their
faces
,
as
well
as
in
those
of
the
black
-
visaged
sheep
,
which
is
seldom
seen
in
the
placidly
stupid
countenances
of
well
-
fed
animals
.
<EOS>
All
the
fences
were
turf
banks
,
with
loose
stones
piled
into
walls
on
the
top
of
these
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
comparative
fertility
and
luxuriance
down
below
in
the
rare
green
dales
.
<EOS>
The
narrow
meadows
stretching
along
the
brookside
seemed
as
though
the
cows
could
really
satisfy
their
hunger
in
the
deep
rich
grass
;
whereas
on
the
higher
lands
the
scanty
herbage
was
hardly
worth
the
fatigue
of
moving
about
in
search
of
it
.
<EOS>
Even
in
these
"
bottoms
"
the
piping
sea
-
winds
,
following
the
current
of
the
stream
,
stunted
and
cut
low
any
trees
;
but
still
there
was
rich
thick
underwood
,
tangled
and
tied
together
with
brambles
,
and
brier
-
rose
,
[
sic
]
and
honeysuckle
;
and
if
the
farmer
in
these
comparatively
happy
valleys
had
had
wife
or
daughter
who
cared
for
gardening
,
many
a
flower
would
have
grown
on
the
western
or
southern
side
of
the
rough
stone
house
.
<EOS>
But
at
that
time
gardening
was
not
a
popular
art
in
any
part
of
England
;
in
the
north
it
is
not
yet
.
<EOS>
Noblemen
and
gentlemen
may
have
beautiful
gardens
;
but
farmers
and
day
-
labourers
care
little
for
them
north
of
the
Trent
,
which
is
all
I
can
answer
for
.
<EOS>
A
few
"
berry
"
bushes
,
a
black
currant
tree
or
two
(
the
leaves
to
be
used
in
heightening
the
flavour
of
tea
,
the
fruit
as
medicinal
for
colds
and
sore
throats
)
,
a
potato
ground
(
and
this
was
not
so
common
at
the
close
of
the
last
century
as
it
is
now
)
,
a
cabbage
bed
,
a
bush
of
sage
,
and
balm
,
and
thyme
,
and
marjoram
,
with
possibly
a
rose
tree
,
and
"
old
man
"
growing
in
the
midst
;
a
little
plot
of
small
strong
coarse
onions
,
and
perhaps
some
marigolds
,
the
petals
of
which
flavoured
the
salt
-
beef
broth
;
such
plants
made
up
a
well
-
furnished
garden
to
a
farmhouse
at
the
time
and
place
to
which
my
story
belongs
.
<EOS>
But
for
twenty
miles
inland
there
was
no
forgetting
the
sea
,
nor
the
sea
-
trade
;
refuse
shell
-
fish
,
seaweed
,
the
offal
of
the
melting
-
houses
,
were
the
staple
manure
of
the
district
;
great
ghastly
whale
-
jaws
,
bleached
bare
and
white
,
were
the
arches
over
the
gate
-
posts
to
many
a
field
or
moorland
stretch
.
<EOS>
Out
of
every
family
of
several
sons
,
however
agricultural
their
position
might
be
,
one
had
gone
to
sea
,
and
the
mother
looked
wistfully
seaward
at
the
changes
of
the
keen
piping
moorland
winds
.
<EOS>
The
holiday
rambles
were
to
the
coast
;
no
one
cared
to
go
inland
to
see
aught
,
unless
indeed
it
might
be
to
the
great
annual
horse
-
fairs
held
where
the
dreary
land
broke
into
habitation
and
cultivation
.
  
<EOS>
Somehow
in
this
country
sea
thoughts
followed
the
thinker
far
inland
;
whereas
in
most
other
parts
of
the
island
,
at
five
miles
from
the
ocean
,
he
has
all
but
forgotten
the
existence
of
such
an
element
as
salt
water
.
<EOS>
The
great
Greenland
trade
of
the
coasting
towns
was
the
main
and
primary
cause
of
this
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
also
a
dread
and
an
irritation
in
every
one
's
mind
,
at
the
time
of
which
I
write
,
in
connection
with
the
neighbouring
sea
.
  
<EOS>
Since
the
termination
of
the
American
war
,
there
had
been
nothing
to
call
for
any
unusual
energy
in
manning
the
navy
;
and
the
grants
required
by
Government
for
this
purpose
diminished
with
every
year
of
peace
.
<EOS>
In
1792
this
grant
touched
its
minimum
for
many
years
.
<EOS>
In
1793
the
proceedings
of
the
French
had
set
Europe
on
fire
,
and
the
English
were
raging
with
anti
-
Gallican
excitement
,
fomented
into
action
by
every
expedient
of
the
Crown
and
its
Ministers
.
<EOS>
We
had
our
ships
;
but
where
were
our
men
?
<EOS>
The
Admiralty
had
,
however
,
a
ready
remedy
at
hand
,
with
ample
precedent
for
its
use
,
and
with
common
(
if
not
statute
)
law
to
sanction
its
application
.
<EOS>
They
issued
"
press
warrants
,
"
calling
upon
the
civil
power
throughout
the
country
to
support
their
officers
in
the
discharge
of
their
duty
.
<EOS>
The
sea
-
coast
was
divided
into
districts
,
under
the
charge
of
a
captain
in
the
navy
,
who
again
delegated
sub
-
districts
to
lieutenants
;
and
in
this
manner
all
homeward
-
bound
vessels
were
watched
and
waited
for
,
all
ports
were
under
supervision
;
and
in
a
day
,
if
need
were
,
a
large
number
of
men
could
be
added
to
the
forces
of
his
Majesty
's
navy
.
<EOS>
But
if
the
Admiralty
became
urgent
in
their
demands
,
they
were
also
willing
to
be
unscrupulous
.
<EOS>
Landsmen
,
if
able
-
bodied
,
might
soon
be
trained
into
good
sailors
;
and
once
in
the
hold
of
the
tender
,
which
always
awaited
the
success
of
the
operations
of
the
press
-
gang
,
it
was
difficult
for
such
prisoners
to
bring
evidence
of
the
nature
of
their
former
occupations
,
especially
when
none
had
leisure
to
listen
to
such
evidence
,
or
were
willing
to
believe
it
if
they
did
listen
,
or
would
act
upon
it
for
the
release
of
the
captive
<EOS>
if
they
had
by
possibility
both
listened
and
believed
.
<EOS>
Men
were
kidnapped
,
literally
disappeared
,
and
nothing
was
ever
heard
of
them
again
.
<EOS>
The
street
of
a
busy
town
was
not
safe
from
such
press
-
gang
captures
,
as
Lord
Thurlow
could
have
told
,
after
a
certain
walk
he
took
about
this
time
on
Tower
Hill
,
when
he
,
the
attorney
-
general
of
England
,
was
impressed
,
when
the
Admiralty
had
its
own
peculiar
ways
of
getting
rid
of
tiresome
besiegers
and
petitioners
.
<EOS>
Nor
yet
were
lonely
inland
dwellers
more
secure
;
many
a
rustic
went
to
a
statute
fair
or
"
mop
,
"
and
never
came
home
to
tell
of
his
hiring
;
many
a
stout
young
farmer
vanished
from
his
place
by
the
hearth
of
his
father
,
and
was
no
more
heard
of
by
mother
or
lover
;
so
great
was
the
press
for
men
to
serve
in
the
navy
during
the
early
years
of
the
war
with
France
,
and
after
every
great
naval
victory
of
that
war
.
  
<EOS>
The
servants
of
the
Admiralty
lay
in
wait
for
all
merchantmen
and
traders
;
there
were
many
instances
of
vessels
returning
home
after
long
absence
,
and
laden
with
rich
cargo
,
being
boarded
within
a
day
's
distance
of
land
,
and
so
many
men
pressed
and
carried
off
,
that
the
ship
,
with
her
cargo
,
became
unmanageable
from
the
loss
of
her
crew
,
drifted
out
again
into
the
wild
wide
ocean
,
and
was
sometimes
found
in
the
helpless
guidance
of
one
or
two
infirm
or
ignorant
sailors
;
sometimes
such
vessels
were
never
heard
of
more
.
<EOS>
The
men
thus
pressed
were
taken
from
the
near
grasp
of
parents
or
wives
,
and
were
often
deprived
of
the
hard
earnings
of
years
,
which
remained
in
the
hands
of
the
masters
of
the
merchantman
in
which
they
had
served
,
subject
to
all
the
chances
of
honesty
or
dishonesty
,
life
or
death
.
<EOS>
Now
all
this
tyranny
(
for
I
can
use
no
other
word
)
is
marvellous
to
us
;
we
can
not
imagine
how
it
is
that
a
nation
submitted
to
it
for
so
long
,
even
under
any
warlike
enthusiasm
,
any
panic
of
invasion
,
any
amount
of
loyal
subservience
to
the
governing
powers
.
<EOS>
When
we
read
of
the
military
being
called
in
to
assist
the
civil
power
in
backing
up
the
press
-
gang
,
of
parties
of
soldiers
patrolling
the
streets
,
and
sentries
with
screwed
bayonets
placed
at
every
door
while
the
press
-
gang
entered
and
searched
each
hole
and
corner
of
the
dwelling
;
when
we
hear
of
churches
being
surrounded
during
divine
service
by
troops
,
while
the
press
-
gang
stood
ready
at
the
door
to
seize
men
as
they
came
out
from
attending
public
worship
,
and
take
these
instances
as
merely
types
of
what
was
constantly
going
on
in
different
forms
,
we
do
not
wonder
at
Lord
Mayors
,
and
other
civic
authorities
in
large
towns
,
complaining
that
a
stop
was
put
to
business
by
the
danger
which
the
tradesmen
and
their
servants
incurred
in
leaving
their
houses
and
going
into
the
streets
,
infested
by
press
-
gangs
.
  
<EOS>
Whether
it
was
that
living
in
closer
neighbourhood
to
the
metropolis
 
<EOS>
the
centre
of
politics
and
news
 
inspired
the
inhabitants
of
the
southern
counties
with
a
strong
feeling
of
that
kind
of
patriotism
which
consists
in
hating
all
other
nations
;
or
whether
it
was
that
the
chances
of
capture
were
so
much
greater
at
all
the
southern
ports
that
the
merchant
sailors
became
inured
to
the
danger
;
or
whether
it
was
that
serving
in
the
navy
,
to
those
familiar
with
such
towns
as
Portsmouth
and
Plymouth
,
had
an
attraction
to
most
men
from
the
dash
and
brilliancy
of
the
adventurous
employment
 
<EOS>
it
is
certain
that
the
southerners
took
the
oppression
of
press
-
warrants
more
submissively
than
the
wild
north
-
eastern
people
.
<EOS>
For
with
them
the
chances
of
profit
beyond
their
wages
in
the
whaling
or
Greenland
trade
extended
to
the
lowest
description
of
sailor
.
<EOS>
He
might
rise
by
daring
and
saving
to
be
a
ship
-
owner
himself
.
<EOS>
Numbers
around
him
had
done
so
;
and
this
very
fact
made
the
distinction
between
class
and
class
less
apparent
;
and
the
common
ventures
and
dangers
,
the
universal
interest
felt
in
one
pursuit
,
bound
the
inhabitants
of
that
line
of
coast
together
with
a
strong
tie
,
the
severance
of
which
by
any
violent
extraneous
measure
,
gave
rise
to
passionate
anger
and
thirst
for
vengeance
.
<EOS>
A
Yorkshireman
once
said
to
me
,
"
My
county
folk
are
all
alike
.
<EOS>
Their
first
thought
is
how
to
resist
.
<EOS>
Why
!
<EOS>
I
myself
,
if
I
hear
a
man
say
it
is
a
fine
day
,
catch
myself
trying
to
find
out
that
it
is
no
such
thing
.
<EOS>
It
is
so
in
thought
;
it
is
so
in
word
;
it
is
so
in
deed
.
"
  
<EOS>
So
you
may
imagine
the
press
-
gang
had
no
easy
time
of
it
on
the
Yorkshire
coast
.
<EOS>
In
other
places
they
inspired
fear
,
but
here
rage
and
hatred
.
<EOS>
The
Lord
Mayor
of
York
was
warned
on
20th
January
,
1777
,
by
an
anonymous
letter
,
that
'
if
those
men
were
not
sent
from
the
city
on
or
before
the
following
Tuesday
,
his
lordship
's
own
dwelling
,
and
the
Mansion
-
house
also
,
should
be
burned
to
the
ground
.
"
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
something
of
the
ill
-
feeling
that
prevailed
on
the
subject
was
owing
to
the
fact
which
I
have
noticed
in
other
places
similarly
situated
.
<EOS>
Where
the
landed
possessions
of
gentlemen
of
ancient
family
but
limited
income
surround
a
centre
of
any
kind
of
profitable
trade
or
manufacture
,
there
is
a
sort
of
latent
ill
-
will
on
the
part
of
the
squires
to
the
tradesman
,
<EOS>
be
he
manufacturer
,
merchant
,
or
ship
-
owner
,
in
whose
hands
is
held
a
power
of
money
-
making
,
which
no
hereditary
pride
,
or
gentlemanly
love
of
doing
nothing
,
prevents
him
from
using
.
<EOS>
This
ill
-
will
,
to
be
sure
,
is
mostly
of
a
negative
kind
;
its
most
common
form
of
manifestation
is
in
absence
of
speech
or
action
,
a
sort
of
torpid
and
genteel
ignoring
all
unpleasant
neighbours
;
but
really
the
whale
-
fisheries
of
Monkshaven
had
become
so
impertinently
and
obtrusively
prosperous
of
late
years
at
the
time
of
which
I
write
,
the
Monkshaven
ship
-
owners
were
growing
so
wealthy
and
consequential
,
that
the
squires
,
who
lived
at
home
at
ease
in
the
old
stone
manor
-
houses
scattered
up
and
down
the
surrounding
moorland
,
felt
that
the
check
upon
the
Monkshaven
trade
likely
to
be
inflicted
by
the
press
-
gang
,
was
wisely
ordained
by
the
higher
powers
(
how
high
they
placed
these
powers
I
will
not
venture
to
say
)
,
to
prevent
overhaste
in
getting
rich
,
which
was
a
scriptural
fault
,
and
they
also
thought
that
they
were
only
doing
their
duty
in
backing
up
the
Admiralty
warrants
by
all
the
civil
power
at
their
disposal
,
whenever
they
were
called
upon
,
and
whenever
they
could
do
so
without
taking
too
much
trouble
in
affairs
which
did
not
after
all
much
concern
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
just
another
motive
in
the
minds
of
some
provident
parents
of
many
daughters
.
<EOS>
The
captains
and
lieutenants
employed
on
this
service
were
mostly
agreeable
bachelors
,
brought
up
to
a
genteel
profession
,
at
the
least
they
were
very
pleasant
visitors
,
when
they
had
a
day
to
spare
;
who
knew
what
might
come
of
it
?
  
<EOS>
Indeed
,
these
brave
officers
were
not
unpopular
in
Monkshaven
itself
,
except
at
the
time
when
they
were
brought
into
actual
collision
with
the
people
.
<EOS>
They
had
the
frank
manners
of
their
profession
;
they
were
known
to
have
served
in
those
engagements
,
the
very
narrative
of
which
at
this
day
will
warm
the
heart
of
a
Quaker
,
and
they
themselves
did
not
come
prominently
forward
in
the
dirty
work
which
,
nevertheless
,
was
permitted
and
quietly
sanctioned
by
them
.
<EOS>
So
while
few
Monkshaven
people
passed
the
low
public
-
house
over
which
the
navy
blue
-
flag
streamed
,
as
a
sign
that
it
was
the
rendezvous
of
the
press
-
gang
,
without
spitting
towards
it
in
sign
of
abhorrence
,
yet
,
perhaps
,
the
very
same
persons
would
give
some
rough
token
of
respect
to
Lieutenant
Atkinson
if
they
met
him
in
High
Street
.
<EOS>
Touching
their
hats
was
an
unknown
gesture
in
those
parts
,
but
they
would
move
their
heads
in
a
droll
,
familiar
kind
of
way
,
neither
a
wag
nor
a
nod
,
but
meant
all
the
same
to
imply
friendly
regard
.
<EOS>
The
ship
-
owners
,
too
,
invited
him
to
an
occasional
dinner
or
supper
,
all
the
time
looking
forward
to
the
chances
of
his
turning
out
an
active
enemy
,
and
not
by
any
means
inclined
to
give
him
"
the
run
of
the
house
,
"
however
many
unmarried
daughters
might
grace
their
table
.
<EOS>
Still
as
he
could
tell
a
rattling
story
,
drink
hard
,
and
was
seldom
too
busy
to
come
at
a
short
notice
,
he
got
on
better
than
any
one
could
have
expected
with
the
Monkshaven
folk
.
<EOS>
And
the
principal
share
of
the
odium
of
his
business
fell
on
his
subordinates
,
who
were
one
and
all
regarded
in
the
light
of
mean
kidnappers
and
spies
 
"
varmint
,
"
as
the
common
people
esteemed
them
:
and
as
such
they
were
ready
at
the
first
provocation
to
hunt
and
to
worry
them
,
and
little
cared
the
press
-
gang
for
this
.
<EOS>
Whatever
else
they
were
,
they
were
brave
and
daring
.
<EOS>
They
had
law
to
back
them
,
therefore
their
business
was
lawful
.
<EOS>
They
were
serving
their
king
and
country
.
<EOS>
They
were
using
all
their
faculties
,
and
that
is
always
pleasant
.
<EOS>
There
was
plenty
of
scope
for
the
glory
and
triumph
of
outwitting
;
plenty
of
adventure
in
their
life
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
lawful
and
loyal
employment
,
requiring
sense
,
readiness
,
courage
,
and
<EOS>
besides
it
called
out
that
strange
love
of
the
chase
inherent
in
every
man
.
<EOS>
Fourteen
or
fifteen
miles
at
sea
lay
the
_
Aurora
_
,
good
man
-
of

war
;
and
to
her
were
conveyed
the
living
cargoes
of
several
tenders
,
which
were
stationed
at
likely
places
along
the
sea
-
coast
.
<EOS>
One
,
the
_
Lively
Lady
_
,
might
be
seen
from
the
cliffs
above
Monkshaven
,
not
so
far
away
,
but
hidden
by
the
angle
of
the
high
lands
from
the
constant
sight
of
the
townspeople
;
and
there
was
always
the
Randyvow
-
house
(
as
the
public
-
house
with
the
navy
blue
-
flag
was
called
thereabouts
)
for
the
crew
of
the
_
Lively
Lady
_
to
lounge
about
,
and
there
to
offer
drink
to
unwary
passers
-
by
.
<EOS>
At
present
this
was
all
that
the
press
-
gang
had
done
at
Monkshaven
.
    
<EOS>
HOME
FROM
GREENLAND
  
<EOS>
One
hot
day
,
early
in
October
of
the
year
1796
,
two
girls
set
off
from
their
country
homes
to
Monkshaven
to
sell
their
butter
and
eggs
,
for
they
were
both
farmers
'
daughters
,
though
rather
in
different
circumstances
;
for
Molly
Corney
was
one
of
a
large
family
of
children
,
and
had
to
rough
it
accordingly
;
Sylvia
Robson
was
an
only
child
,
and
was
much
made
of
in
more
people
's
estimation
than
Mary
's
by
her
elderly
parents
.
<EOS>
They
had
each
purchases
to
make
after
their
sales
were
effected
,
as
sales
of
butter
and
eggs
were
effected
in
those
days
by
the
market
-
women
sitting
on
the
steps
of
the
great
old
mutilated
cross
till
a
certain
hour
in
the
afternoon
,
after
which
,
if
all
their
goods
were
not
disposed
of
,
they
took
them
unwillingly
to
the
shops
and
sold
them
at
a
lower
price
.
<EOS>
But
good
housewives
did
not
despise
coming
themselves
to
the
Butter
Cross
,
and
,
smelling
and
depreciating
the
articles
they
wanted
,
kept
up
a
perpetual
struggle
of
words
,
trying
,
often
in
vain
,
to
beat
down
prices
.
<EOS>
A
housekeeper
of
the
last
century
would
have
thought
that
she
did
not
know
her
business
,
if
she
had
not
gone
through
this
preliminary
process
;
and
the
farmers
'
wives
and
daughters
treated
it
all
as
a
matter
of
course
,
replying
with
a
good
deal
of
independent
humour
to
the
customer
,
who
,
once
having
discovered
where
good
butter
and
fresh
eggs
were
to
be
sold
,
came
time
after
time
to
depreciate
the
articles
she
always
ended
in
taking
.
<EOS>
There
was
leisure
for
all
this
kind
of
work
in
those
days
.
  
<EOS>
Molly
had
tied
a
knot
on
her
pink
-
spotted
handkerchief
for
each
of
the
various
purchases
she
had
to
make
;
dull
but
important
articles
needed
for
the
week
's
consumption
at
home
;
if
she
forgot
any
one
of
them
she
knew
she
was
sure
of
a
good
"
rating
"
from
her
mother
.
<EOS>
The
number
of
them
made
her
pocket
-
handkerchief
look
like
one
of
the
nine
-
tails
of
a
"
cat
;
"
but
not
a
single
thing
was
for
herself
,
nor
,
indeed
,
for
any
one
individual
of
her
numerous
family
.
<EOS>
There
was
neither
much
thought
nor
much
money
to
spend
for
any
but
collective
wants
in
the
Corney
family
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
different
with
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
She
was
going
to
choose
her
first
cloak
,
not
to
have
an
old
one
of
her
mother
's
,
that
had
gone
down
through
two
sisters
,
dyed
for
the
fourth
time
(
and
Molly
would
have
been
glad
<EOS>
had
even
this
chance
been
hers
)
,
but
to
buy
a
bran
-
new
duffle
cloak
all
for
herself
,
with
not
even
an
elder
authority
to
curb
her
as
to
price
,
only
Molly
to
give
her
admiring
counsel
,
and
as
much
sympathy
as
was
consistent
with
a
little
patient
envy
of
Sylvia
's
happier
circumstances
.
<EOS>
Every
now
<EOS>
and
then
they
wandered
off
from
the
one
grand
subject
of
thought
,
but
Sylvia
,
with
unconscious
art
,
soon
brought
the
conversation
round
to
the
fresh
consideration
of
the
respective
merits
of
gray
and
scarlet
.
<EOS>
These
girls
were
walking
bare
-
foot
and
carrying
their
shoes
and
stockings
in
their
hands
during
the
first
part
of
their
way
;
but
as
they
were
drawing
near
Monkshaven
they
stopped
,
and
turned
aside
along
a
foot
-
path
that
led
from
the
main
-
road
down
to
the
banks
of
the
Dee
.
<EOS>
There
were
great
stones
in
the
river
about
here
,
round
which
the
waters
gathered
and
eddied
and
formed
deep
pools
.
<EOS>
Molly
sate
down
on
the
grassy
bank
to
wash
her
feet
;
but
Sylvia
,
more
active
(
or
perhaps
lighter
-
hearted
with
the
notion
of
the
cloak
in
the
distance
)
,
placed
her
basket
on
a
gravelly
bit
of
shore
,
and
,
giving
a
long
spring
,
seated
herself
on
a
stone
almost
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
.
<EOS>
Then
she
began
dipping
her
little
rosy
toes
in
the
cool
rushing
water
and
whisking
them
out
with
childish
glee
.
  
<EOS>
"
Be
quiet
,
wi
'
the
'
,
Sylvia
?
<EOS>
Thou'st
splashing
me
all
ower
,
and
my
feyther'll
noane
be
so
keen
<EOS>
o
'
giving
me
a
new
cloak
as
thine
is
,
seemingly
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
was
quiet
,
not
to
say
penitent
,
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
She
drew
up
her
feet
instantly
;
and
,
as
if
to
take
herself
out
of
temptation
,
she
turned
away
from
Molly
to
that
side
of
her
stony
seat
on
which
the
current
ran
shallow
,
and
broken
by
pebbles
.
<EOS>
But
once
disturbed
in
her
play
,
her
thoughts
reverted
to
the
great
subject
of
the
cloak
.
<EOS>
She
was
now
as
still
as
a
minute
before
she
had
been
full
of
frolic
and
gambolling
life
.
<EOS>
She
had
tucked
herself
up
on
the
stone
,
as
if
it
had
been
a
cushion
,
and
she
a
little
sultana
.
  
<EOS>
Molly
was
deliberately
washing
her
feet
and
drawing
on
her
stockings
,
when
she
heard
a
sudden
sigh
,
and
her
companion
turned
round
so
as
to
face
her
,
and
said
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
mother
had
n't
spoken
up
for
t
'
gray
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Sylvia
,
thou
wert
saying
as
we
topped
t'brow
,
as
she
did
nought
but
<EOS>
bid
thee
think
twice
afore
settling
on
scarlet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
<EOS>
but
mother
's
words
are
scarce
,
and
weigh
heavy
.
<EOS>
Feyther
's
liker
me
,
and
we
talk
a
deal
o
'
rubble
;
but
mother
's
words
are
liker
to
hewn
stone
.
<EOS>
She
puts
a
deal
o
'
meaning
in
'em
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
as
if
she
was
put
out
by
the
suggestion
,
"
she
bid
me
ask
cousin
Philip
for
his
opinion
.
<EOS>
I
hate
a
man
as
has
getten
an
opinion
on
such
-
like
things
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
we
shall
niver
get
to
Monkshaven
this
day
,
either
for
to
sell
our
eggs
and
stuff
,
or
to
buy
thy
cloak
,
if
we
're
sittin
'
here
much
longer
.
<EOS>
T
'
sun
's
for
slanting
low
,
so
come
along
,
lass
,
and
let
's
be
going
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
I
put
on
my
stockings
and
shoon
here
,
and
jump
back
into
yon
wet
gravel
,
I
'
se
not
be
fit
to
be
seen
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
in
a
pathetic
tone
of
bewilderment
,
that
was
funnily
childlike
.
<EOS>
She
stood
up
,
her
bare
feet
curved
round
the
curving
surface
of
the
stone
,
her
slight
figure
balancing
as
if
in
act
to
spring
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thou
knows
thou'll
have
just
to
jump
back
barefoot
,
and
wash
thy
feet
afresh
,
without
making
all
that
ado
;
thou
shouldst
ha
'
done
it
at
first
,
like
me
,
and
all
other
sensible
folk
.
<EOS>
But
thou'st
getten
no
gumption
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Molly
's
mouth
was
stopped
by
Sylvia
's
hand
.
<EOS>
She
was
already
on
the
river
bank
by
her
friend
's
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
dunnot
lecture
me
;
I
'm
none
for
a
sermon
hung
on
every
peg
o
'
words
.
<EOS>
I
'm
going
to
have
a
new
cloak
,
lass
,
and
<EOS>
I
can
not
heed
thee
if
thou
dost
lecture
.
<EOS>
Thou
shall
have
all
the
gumption
,
and
I
'll
have
my
cloak
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
may
be
doubted
whether
Molly
thought
this
an
equal
division
.
  
<EOS>
Each
girl
wore
tightly
-
fitting
stockings
,
knit
by
her
own
hands
,
of
<EOS>
the
blue
worsted
common
in
that
country
;
they
had
on
neat
high
-
heeled
black
leather
shoes
,
coming
well
over
the
instep
,
and
fastened
as
well
as
ornamented
with
bright
steel
buckles
.
<EOS>
They
did
not
walk
so
lightly
and
freely
now
as
they
did
before
they
were
shod
,
but
their
steps
were
still
springy
with
the
buoyancy
of
early
youth
;
for
neither
of
them
was
twenty
,
indeed
I
believe
Sylvia
was
not
more
than
seventeen
at
this
time
.
  
<EOS>
They
clambered
up
the
steep
grassy
path
,
with
brambles
catching
at
their
kilted
petticoats
,
through
the
copse
-
wood
,
till
they
regained
the
high
road
;
and
then
they
"
settled
themselves
,
"
as
they
called
it
<EOS>
;
that
is
to
say
,
they
took
off
their
black
felt
hats
,
and
tied
up
their
clustering
hair
afresh
;
they
shook
off
every
speck
of
wayside
dust
;
straightened
the
little
shawls
(
or
large
neck
-
kerchiefs
,
call
them
which
you
will
)
that
were
spread
over
their
shoulders
,
pinned
below
the
throat
,
and
confined
at
the
waist
by
their
apron
-
strings
;
and
then
putting
on
their
hats
again
,
and
picking
up
their
baskets
,
they
prepared
to
walk
decorously
into
the
town
of
Monkshaven
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
turn
of
the
road
showed
them
the
red
peaked
roofs
of
the
closely
packed
houses
lying
almost
directly
below
the
hill
on
which
they
were
.
<EOS>
The
full
autumn
sun
brought
out
the
ruddy
colour
of
the
tiled
gables
,
and
deepened
the
shadows
in
the
narrow
streets
.
<EOS>
The
narrow
harbour
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
was
crowded
with
small
vessels
of
all
descriptions
,
making
an
intricate
forest
of
masts
.
<EOS>
Beyond
lay
the
sea
,
like
a
flat
pavement
of
sapphire
,
scarcely
a
ripple
varying
its
sunny
surface
<EOS>
,
that
stretched
out
leagues
away
till
it
blended
with
the
softened
azure
of
the
sky
.
<EOS>
On
this
blue
trackless
water
floated
scores
of
white
-
sailed
fishing
boats
,
apparently
motionless
,
unless
you
measured
their
progress
by
some
land
-
mark
;
but
still
,
and
silent
,
and
distant
as
they
seemed
,
the
consciousness
that
there
were
men
on
board
,
each
going
forth
into
the
great
deep
,
added
unspeakably
to
the
interest
felt
in
watching
them
.
<EOS>
Close
to
the
bar
of
the
river
Dee
a
larger
vessel
lay
to
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
,
who
had
only
recently
come
into
the
neighbourhood
,
looked
at
this
with
the
same
quiet
interest
as
she
did
at
all
the
others
;
but
Molly
,
as
soon
as
her
eye
caught
the
build
of
it
,
cried
out
aloud
    
<EOS>
"
She
's
a
whaler
!
<EOS>
she
's
a
whaler
home
from
t
'
Greenland
seas
!
<EOS>
T
'
first
this
season
!
<EOS>
God
bless
her
!
"
<EOS>
and
she
turned
round
and
shook
both
Sylvia
's
hands
in
the
fulness
of
her
excitement
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
's
colour
rose
,
and
her
eyes
sparkled
out
of
sympathy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
ta
sure
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
,
breathless
in
her
turn
;
for
though
she
did
not
know
by
the
aspect
of
the
different
ships
on
what
trade
they
were
bound
,
yet
she
was
well
aware
of
the
paramount
interest
attached
to
whaling
vessels
.
  
<EOS>
"
Three
o'clock
!
<EOS>
and
it
's
not
high
water
till
five
!
"
said
Molly
.
<EOS>
"
If
we
're
sharp
we
can
sell
our
eggs
,
and
be
down
to
the
staithes
before
she
comes
into
port
.
<EOS>
Be
sharp
,
lass
!
"
  
<EOS>
And
down
the
steep
long
hill
they
went
at
a
pace
that
was
almost
a
run
.
<EOS>
A
run
they
dared
not
make
it
;
and
as
it
was
,
the
rate
at
which
they
walked
would
have
caused
destruction
among
eggs
less
carefully
packed
.
<EOS>
When
the
descent
was
ended
,
there
was
yet
the
long
narrow
street
before
them
,
bending
and
swerving
from
the
straight
line
,
as
it
followed
the
course
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
The
girls
felt
as
if
they
should
never
come
to
the
market
-
place
,
which
was
situated
at
the
crossing
of
Bridge
Street
and
High
Street
.
<EOS>
There
the
old
stone
cross
was
raised
by
the
monks
long
ago
;
now
worn
and
mutilated
,
no
one
esteemed
it
as
a
holy
symbol
,
but
only
as
the
Butter
Cross
,
where
market
-
women
clustered
on
Wednesday
,
and
whence
the
town
crier
made
all
his
proclamations
of
household
sales
,
things
lost
or
found
,
beginning
with
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
yes
,
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
yes
,
<EOS>
oh
!
yes
!
"
<EOS>
and
ending
with
"
God
bless
the
king
and
the
lord
of
this
manor
,
"
and
a
very
brisk
"
Amen
,
"
before
he
went
on
his
way
and
took
off
the
livery
-
coat
,
the
colours
of
which
marked
him
as
a
servant
of
the
Burnabys
,
the
family
who
held
manorial
rights
over
Monkshaven
.
  
<EOS>
Of
course
the
much
frequented
space
surrounding
the
Butter
Cross
was
the
favourite
centre
for
shops
;
and
on
this
day
,
a
fine
market
day
,
just
when
good
housewives
begin
to
look
over
their
winter
store
of
blankets
and
flannels
,
and
discover
their
needs
betimes
,
these
shops
ought
to
have
had
plenty
of
customers
.
<EOS>
But
they
were
empty
and
of
even
quieter
aspect
than
their
every
-
day
wo
nt
.
<EOS>
The
three
-
legged
creepie
-
stools
that
were
hired
out
at
a
penny
an
hour
to
such
market
-
women
as
came
too
late
to
find
room
on
the
steps
were
unoccupied
;
knocked
over
here
and
there
,
as
if
people
had
passed
by
in
haste
.
  
<EOS>
Molly
took
in
all
at
a
glance
,
and
interpreted
the
signs
,
though
she
had
no
time
to
explain
their
meaning
,
and
her
consequent
course
of
action
,
to
Sylvia
,
but
darted
into
a
corner
shop
.
  
<EOS>
"
T
'
whalers
is
coming
home
!
<EOS>
There
's
one
lying
outside
t
'
bar
!
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
put
in
the
form
of
an
assertion
;
but
the
tone
was
that
of
eager
cross
-
questioning
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
"
said
a
lame
man
,
mending
fishing
-
nets
behind
a
rough
deal
counter
.
<EOS>
"
She
's
come
back
airly
,
and
she
's
brought
good
news
<EOS>
o
'
t
'
others
,
as
I
've
heered
say
.
<EOS>
Time
was
I
should
ha
'
been
on
th

staithes
throwing
up
my
cap
wit
'
t

but
now
it
pleases
t
'
Lord
to
keep
me
at
home
,
and
set
me
to
mind
other
folks

<EOS>
See

while

<EOS>
Leave

<EOS>
Ay

<EOS>
they

out

<EOS>
o

my
moralities

I

out

"
  
<EOS>
He
put
the
baskets
carefully
away
with
much
of
such
talk
as
this
addressed
to
himself
while
he
did
so
.
<EOS>
Then
he
sighed
once
or
twice
;
and
then
he
took
the
better
course
and
began
to
sing
over
his
tarry
work
.
  
<EOS>
Molly
and
Sylvia
were
far
along
the
staithes
by
the
time
he
got
to
this
point
of
cheerfulness
.
<EOS>
They
ran
on
,
regardless
of
stitches
and
pains
in
the
side
;
on
along
the
river
bank
to
where
the
concourse
of
people
was
gathered
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
great
length
of
way
between
the
Butter
Cross
and
the
harbour
;
in
five
minutes
the
breathless
girls
were
close
together
in
the
best
place
they
could
get
for
seeing
,
on
the
outside
of
the
crowd
;
and
in
as
short
a
time
longer
they
were
pressed
inwards
,
by
fresh
arrivals
,
into
the
very
midst
of
the
throng
.
<EOS>
All
eyes
were
directed
to
the
ship
,
beating
her
anchor
just
outside
the
bar
,
not
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
.
<EOS>
The
custom
-
house
officer
was
just
gone
aboard
of
her
to
receive
the
captain
's
report
of
his
cargo
,
and
make
due
examination
.
<EOS>
The
men
who
had
taken
him
out
in
his
boat
were
rowing
back
to
the
shore
,
and
brought
small
fragments
of
news
when
they
landed
a
little
distance
from
the
crowd
,
which
moved
as
one
man
to
hear
what
was
to
be
told
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
took
a
hard
grasp
of
the
hand
of
the
older
and
more
experienced
Molly
,
and
listened
open
-
mouthed
to
the
answers
she
was
extracting
from
a
gruff
old
sailor
she
happened
to
find
near
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
ship
is
she
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
T
'
_
Resolution
_
of
Monkshaven
!
"
<EOS>
said
he
,
indignantly
,
as
if
any
goose
might
have
known
that
.
  
<EOS>
"
An
'
a
good
_
Resolution
_
,
and
a
blessed
ship
she
's
been
to
me
,
"
piped
out
an
old
woman
,
close
at
Mary
's
elbow
.
<EOS>
"
She
's
brought
me
home
<EOS>
my
ae
'
lad
 
<EOS>
for
he
shouted
to
yon
boatman
to
bid
him
<EOS>
tell
me
he
was
well
.
"
<EOS>
Tell
Peggy
Christison
,
"
says
he
<EOS>
(
my
name
is
Margaret
Christison
)
 
<EOS>
"
tell
Peggy
Christison
as
her
son
Hezekiah

back
safe

"
<EOS>
The

be
praised

<EOS>
An
'
me
a
widow
as
never
thought
to
see
my
lad
again
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
if
everybody
relied
on
every
one
else
's
sympathy
in
that
hour
of
great
joy
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ax
pardon
,
but
if
you
'd
gie
me
just
a
bit
of
elbow
-
room
for
a
minute
like
,
I
'd
hold
my
babby
up
,
so
that
he
might
see
daddy
's
ship
,
and
happen
<EOS>
,
my
master
might
see
him
.
<EOS>
He
's
four
months
old
last
Tuesday
se'nnight
,
and
his
feyther
's
never
clapt
eyne
on
him
yet
,
and
he
wi

a

an

"
  
<EOS>
One
or
two
of
the
better
end
of
the
Monkshaven
inhabitants
stood
a
little
before
Molly
and
Sylvia
;
and
as
they
moved
in
compliance
with
the
young
mother
's
request
,
they
overheard
some
of
the
information
these
ship
-
owners
had
received
from
the
boatman
.
  
<EOS>
"
Haynes
says
they
'll
send
the
manifest
of
the
cargo
ashore
in
twenty
minutes
,
as
soon
as
Fishburn
has
looked
over
the
casks
.
<EOS>
Only
eight
whales
,
according
to
what
he
says
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
one
can
tell
,
"
said
the
other
,
"
till
the
manifest
comes
to
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid
he
's
right
.
<EOS>
But
he
brings
a
good
report
of
the
_
<EOS>
Good
Fortune
_
.
<EOS>
She
's
off
St
Abb
's
Head
,
with
something
like
fifteen
whales
to
her
share
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
see
how
much
is
true
,
when
she
comes
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
'll
be
by
the
afternoon

"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
my
cousin
's
ship
,
"
said
Molly
to
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
specksioneer
on
board
the
_
Good
Fortune
_
.
"
  
An
old
man
touched
her
as
she
spoke
    
<EOS>
"
I
humbly
make
my
manners
,
missus
,
but
<EOS>
I
'm
stone
blind
;
my
lad
's
aboard
yon
vessel
outside
t
'
bar
;
and
my
old
woman
is
bed
-
fast
.
<EOS>
Will
she
be
long
,
think
ye
,
in
making
t
'
harbour
?
<EOS>
Because
,
if
so
be
as
she
were
,
I
'd
just
make
my
way
back
,
and
speak
a
word
or
two
to
my
missus
,
who
'll
be
boiling
o'er
into
some
mak
o
'
mischief
<EOS>
now
she
knows
he
's
so
near
.
<EOS>
May
I
be
so
bold
as
to
ax
if
t
'
Crooked
Negro
is
covered
yet
?
"
  
<EOS>
Molly
stood
on
tip
-
toe
to
try
and
see
the
black
stone
thus
named
;
but
Sylvia
,
stooping
and
peeping
through
the
glimpses
afforded
between
the
arms
of
the
moving
people
,
saw
it
first
,
and
told
the
blind
old
man
it
was
still
above
water
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
watched
pot
,
"
said
he
,
<EOS>
"
ne'er
boils
,
I
reckon
.
<EOS>
It
's
ta'en
<EOS>
a
vast
o
<EOS>
'
watter
t
'
cover
that
stone
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Anyhow
,
I
'll
have
time
to
go
home
and
rate
my
missus
for
worritin
'
hersen
,
as
I
'll
be
bound
she
's
done
,
for
all
as
I
bade
her
not
,
but
to
keep
easy
and
content
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
'd
better
be
off
too
,
"
said
Molly
,
as
an
opening
was
made
through
the
press
to
let
out
the
groping
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
Eggs
and
butter
is
yet
to
sell
,
and
tha
'
cloak
to
be
bought
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
suppose
we
had
!
"
<EOS>
said
Sylvia
,
rather
regretfully
;
for
,
though
all
the
way
into
Monkshaven
her
head
had
been
full
of
the
purchase
of
this
cloak
,
yet
she
was
of
that
impressible
nature
that
takes
the
tone
of
feeling
from
those
surrounding
;
and
though
she
knew
no
one
on
board
the
Resolution
,
she
was
just
as
anxious
for
the
moment
to
see
her
come
into
harbour
as
any
one
in
the
crowd
who
had
a
dear
relation
on
board
.
<EOS>
So
she
turned
reluctantly
to
follow
the
more
prudent
Molly
along
the
quay
back
to
the
Butter
Cross
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
pretty
scene
,
though
it
was
too
familiar
to
the
eyes
of
all
who
then
saw
it
for
them
to
notice
its
beauty
.
<EOS>
The
sun
was
low
enough
in
the
west
to
turn
the
mist
that
filled
the
distant
valley
of
the
river
into
golden
haze
.
<EOS>
Above
,
on
either
bank
of
the
Dee
,
there
lay
the
moorland
heights
swelling
one
behind
the
other
;
the
nearer
,
russet
brown
with
the
tints
of
the
fading
bracken
;
the
more
distant
,
gray
and
dim
against
the
rich
autumnal
sky
.
<EOS>
The
red
and
fluted
tiles
of
the
gabled
houses
rose
in
crowded
irregularity
on
one
side
of
the
river
,
while
the
newer
suburb
was
built
in
more
orderly
and
less
picturesque
fashion
on
the
opposite
cliff
.
<EOS>
The
river
itself
was
swelling
and
chafing
with
the
incoming
tide
till
its
vexed
waters
rushed
over
the
very
feet
of
the
watching
crowd
on
the
staithes
,
as
the
great
sea
waves
encroached
more
and
more
every
minute
.
<EOS>
The
quay
-
side
was
unsavourily
ornamented
with
glittering
fish
-
scales
,
for
the
hauls
of
fish
were
cleansed
in
the
open
air
,
and
no
sanitary
arrangements
existed
for
sweeping
away
any
of
the
relics
of
this
operation
.
  
<EOS>
The
fresh
salt
breeze
was
bringing
up
the
lashing
,
leaping
tide
from
the
blue
sea
beyond
the
bar
.
<EOS>
Behind
the
returning
girls
there
rocked
the
white
-
sailed
ship
,
as
if
she
were
all
alive
with
eagerness
for
her
anchors
to
be
heaved
.
  
<EOS>
How
impatient
her
crew
of
beating
hearts
were
for
that
moment
,
how
those
on
land
sickened
at
the
suspense
,
may
be
imagined
,
when
you
remember
that
for
six
long
summer
months
those
sailors
had
been
as
if
dead
from
all
news
of
those
they
loved
;
shut
up
in
terrible
,
dreary
Arctic
seas
from
the
hungry
sight
of
sweethearts
and
friends
,
wives
and
mothers
.
<EOS>
No
one
knew
what
might
have
happened
.
<EOS>
The
crowd
on
shore
grew
silent
and
solemn
before
the
dread
of
the
possible
news
of
death
that
might
toll
in
upon
their
hearts
with
this
uprushing
tide
.
<EOS>
The
whalers
went
out
into
the
Greenland
seas
full
of
strong
,
hopeful
men
;
but
the
whalers
never
returned
as
they
sailed
forth
.
<EOS>
On
land
there
are
deaths
among
two
or
three
hundred
men
to
be
mourned
over
in
every
half
-
year
's
space
of
time
.
<EOS>
Whose
bones
had
been
left
to
blacken
on
the
gray
and
terrible
icebergs
?
<EOS>
Who
lay
still
until
the
sea
should
give
up
its
dead
?
<EOS>
Who
were
those
who
should
come
back
to
Monkshaven
never
,
no
,
never
more
?
  
<EOS>
Many
a
heart
swelled
with
passionate
,
unspoken
fear
,
as
the
first
whaler
lay
off
the
bar
on
her
return
voyage
.
  
<EOS>
Molly
and
Sylvia
had
left
the
crowd
in
this
hushed
suspense
.
<EOS>
But
fifty
yards
along
the
staithe
they
passed
five
or
six
girls
with
flushed
faces
and
careless
attire
,
who
had
mounted
a
pile
of
timber
,
placed
there
to
season
for
ship
-
building
,
from
which
,
as
from
the
steps
of
a
ladder
or
staircase
,
they
could
command
the
harbour
.
<EOS>
They
were
wild
and
free
in
their
gestures
,
and
held
each
other
by
the
hand
,
and
swayed
from
side
to
side
,
stamping
their
feet
in
time
,
as
they
sang
      
Weel
<EOS>
may
the
keel
row
,
the
keel
row
,
the
keel
row
,
  
<EOS>
Weel
may
the
keel
row
that
my
laddie
's
in
!
  
<EOS>
"
What
for
are
ye
going
off
,
now
?
<EOS>
"
they
called
out
to
our
two
girls
.
<EOS>
"
She
'll
be
in
in
ten
minutes
!
"
<EOS>
and
without
waiting
for
the
answer
which
never
came
,
they
resumed
their
song
.
  
<EOS>
Old
sailors
stood
about
in
little
groups
,
too
proud
to
show
their
interest
in
the
adventures
they
could
no
longer
share
,
but
quite
unable
to
keep
up
any
semblance
of
talk
on
indifferent
subjects
.
  
<EOS>
The
town
seemed
very
quiet
and
deserted
as
Molly
and
Sylvia
entered
the
dark
,
irregular
Bridge
Street
,
and
the
market
-
place
was
as
empty
of
people
as
before
.
<EOS>
But
the
skeps
and
baskets
and
three
-
legged
stools
were
all
cleared
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
Market
's
over
for
to
-
day
,
"
said
Molly
Corney
,
in
disappointed
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
We
mun
make
the
best
on't
,
and
sell
to
t
'
huxters
,
and
a
hard
bargain
they
'll
be
for
driving
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
mother'll
be
vexed
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
and
Sylvia
went
to
the
corner
shop
to
reclaim
their
baskets
.
<EOS>
The
man
had
his
joke
at
them
for
their
delay
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
!
lasses
as
has
sweethearts
a
-
coming
home
do
n't
care
much
what
price
they
get
for
butter
and
eggs
!
<EOS>
I
dare
say
,
now
,
there
's
some
un
in
yon
ship
that
'
ud
give
as
much
as
a
shilling
a
pound
for
this
butter
if
he
only
knowed
who
churned
it
!
"
<EOS>
This
was
to
Sylvia
,
as
he
handed
her
back
her
property
.
  
<EOS>
The
fancy
-
free
Sylvia
reddened
,
pouted
,
tossed
back
her
head
,
and
hardly
deigned
a
farewell
word
of
thanks
or
civility
to
the
lame
man
;
she
was
at
an
age
to
be
affronted
by
any
jokes
on
such
a
subject
.
<EOS>
Molly
took
the
joke
without
disclaimer
and
without
offence
.
<EOS>
She
rather
liked
the
unfounded
idea
of
her
having
a
sweetheart
,
and
was
rather
surprised
to
think
how
devoid
of
foundation
the
notion
was
.
<EOS>
If
she
could
have
a
new
cloak
as
Sylvia
was
going
to
have
,
then
,
indeed
,
there
might
be
a
chance
!
<EOS>
Until
some
such
good
luck
,
it
was
as
well
to
laugh
and
blush
as
if
the
surmise
of
her
having
a
lover
was
not
very
far
from
the
truth
,
and
so
she
replied
in
something
of
the
same
strain
as
the
lame
net
-
maker
to
his
joke
about
the
butter
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
'll
need
it
all
,
and
more
too
,
to
grease
his
tongue
,
if
iver
he
reckons
to
win
me
for
his
wife
!
"
  
<EOS>
When
they
were
out
of
the
shop
,
Sylvia
said
,
in
a
coaxing
tone
,
    
"
Molly
,
who
is
it
?
<EOS>
Whose
tongue
'll
need
greasing
?
<EOS>
Just
tell
me
,
and
I
'll
never
tell
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
so
much
in
earnest
that
Molly
was
perplexed
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
quite
like
saying
that
she
had
alluded
to
no
one
in
particular
,
only
to
a
possible
sweetheart
,
so
she
began
to
think
what
young
man
had
made
the
most
civil
speeches
to
her
in
her
life
;
the
list
was
not
a
long
one
to
go
over
,
for
her
father
was
not
so
well
off
as
to
make
her
sought
after
for
her
money
,
and
her
face
was
rather
of
the
homeliest
.
<EOS>
But
she
suddenly
remembered
her
cousin
,
the
specksioneer
,
who
had
given
her
two
large
shells
,
and
taken
a
kiss
from
her
half
-
willing
lips
before
he
went
to
sea
the
last
time
.
<EOS>
So
she
smiled
a
little
,
and
then
said
,
    
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
I
dunno
.
<EOS>
It
's
ill
talking
<EOS>
o
'
these
things
afore
one
has
made
up
one
's
mind
.
<EOS>
And
perhaps
if
Charley
Kinraid
behaves
hissen
,
I
might
be
brought
to
listen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Charley
Kinraid
!
<EOS>
who
's
he
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yon
specksioneer
cousin
o
'
mine
,
as
I
was
talking
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
do
yo
'
think
he
cares
for
yo
'
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Sylvia
,
in
a
low
,
tender
tone
,
as
if
touching
on
a
great
mystery
.
  
<EOS>
Molly
only
said
,
"
Be
quiet
wi
'
yo
'
,
"
and
Sylvia
could
not
make
out
whether
she
cut
the
conversation
so
short
because
she
was
offended
,
or
because
they
had
come
to
the
shop
where
they
had
to
sell
their
butter
and
eggs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Sylvia
,
if
thou'll
leave
me
thy
basket
,
I
'll
make
as
good
a
bargain
as
iver
I
can
on
'em
;
and
thou
can
be
off
to
choose
this
grand
new
cloak
as
is
to
be
,
afore
it
gets
any
darker
.
<EOS>
Where
is
ta
going
to
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
said
I
'd
better
go
to
Foster
's
,
"
answered
Sylvia
,
with
a
shade
of
annoyance
in
her
face
.
"
<EOS>
Feyther
said
just
anywhere
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Foster
's
is
t
'
best
place
;
thou
canst
try
anywhere
afterwards
.
<EOS>
I
'll
be
at
Foster
's
in
five
minutes
,
for
I
reckon
we
mun
hasten
a
bit
now
.
<EOS>
It
'll
be
near
five
o'clock
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
hung
her
head
and
looked
very
demure
as
she
walked
off
by
herself
to
Foster
's
shop
in
the
market
-
place
.
    
<EOS>
BUYING
A
NEW
CLOAK
  
<EOS>
Foster
's
shop
was
the
shop
of
Monkshaven
.
<EOS>
It
was
kept
by
two
Quaker
brothers
,
who
were
now
old
men
;
and
their
father
had
kept
it
before
them
;
probably
his
father
before
that
.
<EOS>
People
remembered
it
as
an
old
-
fashioned
dwelling
-
house
,
with
a
sort
of
supplementary
shop
with
unglazed
windows
projecting
from
the
lower
story
.
<EOS>
These
openings
had
long
been
filled
with
panes
of
glass
that
at
the
present
day
would
be
accounted
very
small
,
but
which
seventy
years
ago
were
much
admired
for
their
size
.
<EOS>
I
can
best
make
you
understand
the
appearance
of
the
place
by
bidding
you
think
of
the
long
openings
in
a
butcher
's
shop
,
and
then
to
fill
them
up
in
your
imagination
with
panes
about
eight
inches
by
six
,
in
a
heavy
wooden
frame
.
<EOS>
There
was
one
of
these
windows
on
each
side
the
door
-
place
,
which
was
kept
partially
closed
through
the
day
by
a
low
gate
about
a
yard
high
.
<EOS>
Half
the
shop
was
appropriated
to
grocery
;
the
other
half
to
drapery
,
and
a
little
mercery
.
<EOS>
The
good
old
brothers
gave
all
their
known
customers
a
kindly
welcome
;
shaking
hands
with
many
of
them
,
and
asking
all
after
their
families
and
domestic
circumstances
before
proceeding
to
business
.
<EOS>
They
would
not
for
the
world
have
had
any
sign
of
festivity
at
Christmas
,
and
scrupulously
kept
their
shop
open
at
that
holy
festival
,
ready
themselves
to
serve
sooner
than
tax
the
consciences
of
any
of
their
assistants
,
only
nobody
ever
came
.
<EOS>
But
on
New
Year
's
Day
they
had
a
great
cake
,
and
wine
,
ready
in
the
parlour
behind
the
shop
,
of
which
all
who
came
in
to
buy
anything
were
asked
to
partake
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
though
scrupulous
in
most
things
,
it
did
not
go
against
the
consciences
of
these
good
brothers
to
purchase
smuggled
articles
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
back
way
from
the
river
-
side
,
up
a
covered
entry
,
to
the
yard
-
door
of
the
Fosters
,
and
a
peculiar
kind
of
knock
at
this
door
always
brought
out
either
John
or
Jeremiah
,
or
if
not
them
,
their
shopman
,
Philip
Hepburn
;
and
the
same
cake
and
wine
that
the
excise
officer
's
wife
might
just
have
been
tasting
,
was
brought
out
in
the
back
parlour
to
treat
the
smuggler
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
little
locking
of
doors
,
and
drawing
of
the
green
silk
curtain
that
was
supposed
to
shut
out
the
shop
,
but
really
all
this
was
done
very
much
for
form
's
sake
.
<EOS>
Everybody
in
Monkshaven
smuggled
who
could
,
and
every
one
wore
smuggled
goods
who
could
,
and
great
reliance
was
placed
on
the
excise
officer
's
neighbourly
feelings
.
  
<EOS>
The
story
went
that
John
and
Jeremiah
Foster
were
so
rich
that
they
could
buy
up
all
the
new
town
across
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
They
had
certainly
begun
to
have
a
kind
of
primitive
bank
in
connection
with
their
shop
,
receiving
and
taking
care
of
such
money
as
people
did
not
wish
to
retain
in
their
houses
for
fear
of
burglars
.
<EOS>
No
one
asked
them
for
interest
on
the
money
thus
deposited
,
nor
did
they
give
any
;
but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
if
any
of
their
customers
,
on
whose
character
they
could
depend
,
wanted
a
little
advance
,
the
Fosters
,
after
due
inquiries
made
,
and
in
some
cases
due
security
given
,
were
not
unwilling
to
lend
a
moderate
sum
without
charging
a
penny
for
the
use
of
their
money
.
<EOS>
All
the
articles
they
sold
were
as
good
as
they
knew
how
to
choose
,
and
for
them
they
expected
and
obtained
ready
money
.
<EOS>
It
was
said
that
they
only
kept
on
the
shop
for
their
amusement
.
<EOS>
Others
averred
that
there
was
some
plan
of
a
marriage
running
in
the
brothers
'
heads
 
a
marriage
between
William
Coulson
,
Mr.
Jeremiah
's
wife
's
nephew
(
Mr.
Jeremiah
was
a
widower
)
,
and
Hester
Rose
,
whose
mother
was
some
kind
of
distant
relation
,
and
who
served
in
the
shop
along
with
William
Coulson
and
Philip
Hepburn
.
<EOS>
Again
,
this
was
denied
by
those
who
averred
that
Coulson
was
no
blood
relation
,
and
that
if
the
Fosters
had
intended
to
do
anything
considerable
for
Hester
,
they
would
never
have
allowed
her
and
her
mother
to
live
in
such
a
sparing
way
,
ekeing
out
their
small
income
by
having
Coulson
and
Hepburn
for
lodgers
.
<EOS>
No
;
John
and
Jeremiah
would
leave
all
their
money
to
some
hospital
or
to
some
charitable
institution
.
<EOS>
But
,
of
course
,
there
was
a
reply
to
this
;
when
are
there
not
many
sides
to
an
argument
about
a
possibility
concerning
which
no
facts
are
known
?
<EOS>
Part
of
the
reply
turned
on
this
:
the
old
gentlemen
had
,
probably
,
some
deep
plan
in
their
heads
in
permitting
their
cousin
to
take
Coulson
and
Hepburn
as
lodgers
,
the
one
a
kind
of
nephew
,
the
other
,
though
so
young
,
the
head
man
in
the
shop
;
if
either
of
them
took
a
fancy
to
Hester
,
how
agreeably
matters
could
be
arranged
!
  
<EOS>
All
this
time
Hester
is
patiently
waiting
to
serve
Sylvia
,
who
is
standing
before
her
<EOS>
a
little
shy
,
a
little
perplexed
and
distracted
,
by
the
sight
of
so
many
pretty
things
.
  
<EOS>
Hester
was
a
tall
young
woman
,
sparely
yet
largely
formed
,
of
a
grave
aspect
,
which
made
her
look
older
than
she
really
was
.
<EOS>
Her
thick
brown
hair
was
smoothly
taken
off
her
broad
forehead
,
and
put
in
a
very
orderly
fashion
,
under
her
linen
cap
;
her
face
was
a
little
square
,
and
her
complexion
sallow
,
though
the
texture
of
her
skin
was
fine
.
<EOS>
Her
gray
eyes
were
very
pleasant
,
because
they
looked
at
you
so
honestly
and
kindly
;
her
mouth
was
slightly
compressed
,
as
most
have
it
who
are
in
the
habit
of
restraining
their
feelings
;
but
when
she
spoke
you
did
not
perceive
this
,
and
her
rare
smile
slowly
breaking
forth
showed
her
white
even
teeth
,
and
when
accompanied
,
as
it
generally
was
,
by
a
sudden
uplifting
of
her
soft
eyes
,
it
made
her
countenance
very
winning
.
<EOS>
She
was
dressed
in
stuff
of
sober
colours
,
both
in
accordance
with
her
own
taste
,
and
in
unasked
compliance
with
the
religious
customs
of
the
Fosters
;
but
Hester
herself
was
not
a
Friend
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
,
standing
opposite
,
not
looking
at
Hester
,
but
gazing
at
the
ribbons
in
the
shop
window
,
as
if
hardly
conscious
that
any
one
awaited
the
expression
of
her
wishes
,
was
a
great
contrast
;
ready
to
smile
or
to
pout
,
or
to
show
her
feelings
in
any
way
,
with
a
character
as
undeveloped
as
a
child
's
,
affectionate
,
wilful
,
naughty
,
tiresome
,
charming
,
anything
,
in
fact
,
at
present
that
the
chances
of
an
hour
called
out
.
<EOS>
Hester
thought
her
customer
the
prettiest
creature
ever
seen
,
in
the
moment
she
had
for
admiration
before
Sylvia
turned
round
and
,
recalled
to
herself
,
began
,
    
"
Oh
,
I
beg
your
pardon
,
miss
;
I
was
thinking
what
may
the
price
of
yon
crimson
ribbon
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
Hester
said
nothing
,
but
went
to
examine
the
shop
-
mark
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
did
not
mean
that
I
wanted
any
,
I
only
want
some
stuff
for
a
cloak
.
<EOS>
Thank
you
,
miss
,
but
I
am
very
sorry
 
<EOS>
some
duffle
,
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hester
silently
replaced
the
ribbon
and
went
in
search
of
the
duffle
.
<EOS>
While
she
was
gone
Sylvia
was
addressed
by
the
very
person
she
most
wished
to
avoid
,
and
whose
absence
she
had
rejoiced
over
on
first
entering
the
shop
,
her
cousin
Philip
Hepburn
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
a
serious
-
looking
young
man
,
tall
,
but
with
a
slight
stoop
in
his
shoulders
,
brought
on
by
his
occupation
.
<EOS>
He
had
thick
hair
standing
off
from
his
forehead
in
a
peculiar
but
not
unpleasing
manner
;
a
long
face
,
with
a
slightly
aquiline
nose
,
dark
eyes
,
and
a
long
upper
lip
,
which
gave
a
disagreeable
aspect
to
a
face
that
might
otherwise
have
been
good
-
looking
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
day
,
Sylvie
,
"
he
said
;
"
what
are
you
wanting
?
<EOS>
How
are
all
at
home
?
<EOS>
Let
me
help
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
pursed
up
her
red
lips
,
and
did
not
look
at
him
as
she
replied
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
very
well
,
and
so
is
mother
;
feyther
's
got
a
touch
of
rheumatiz
,
and
there
's
a
young
woman
getting
what
I
want
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
turned
a
little
away
from
him
when
she
had
ended
this
sentence
,
as
if
it
had
comprised
all
she
could
possibly
have
to
say
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
exclaimed
,
  
"
You
wo
n't
know
how
to
choose
,
"
and
,
seating
himself
on
the
counter
,
he
swung
himself
over
after
the
fashion
of
shop
-
men
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
took
no
notice
of
him
,
but
pretended
to
be
counting
over
her
money
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
,
Sylvie
?
"
<EOS>
asked
he
,
at
last
annoyed
at
her
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
like
to
be
called
"
Sylvie
;
"
my
name
is
Sylvia
;
and
I
'm
wanting
duffle
for
a
cloak
,
if
you
must
know
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hester
now
returned
,
with
a
shop
-
boy
helping
her
to
drag
along
the
great
rolls
of
scarlet
and
gray
cloth
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
that
,
"
said
Philip
,
kicking
the
red
duffle
with
his
foot
,
and
speaking
to
the
lad
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
gray
you
want
,
is
it
not
,
Sylvie
?
"
<EOS>
He
used
the
name
he
had
had
the
cousin
's
right
to
call
her
by
since
her
childhood
,
without
remembering
her
words
on
the
subject
not
five
minutes
before
;
but
she
did
,
and
was
vexed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Please
,
miss
,
it
is
the
scarlet
duffle
I
want
;
do
n't
let
him
take
it
away
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hester
looked
up
at
both
their
countenances
,
a
little
wondering
what
was
their
position
with
regard
to
each
other
;
for
this
,
then
,
was
the
beautiful
little
cousin
about
whom
Philip
had
talked
to
her
mother
,
as
sadly
spoilt
,
and
shamefully
ignorant
;
a
lovely
little
dunce
,
and
so
forth
.
<EOS>
Hester
had
pictured
Sylvia
Robson
,
somehow
,
as
very
different
from
what
she
was
:
<EOS>
younger
,
more
stupid
,
not
half
so
bright
and
charming
(
for
,
though
she
was
now
both
pouting
and
cross
,
it
was
evident
that
this
was
not
her
accustomed
mood
)
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
devoted
her
attention
to
the
red
cloth
,
pushing
aside
the
gray
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
Hepburn
was
vexed
at
his
advice
being
slighted
;
and
yet
he
urged
it
afresh
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
respectable
,
quiet
-
looking
article
that
will
go
well
with
any
colour
;
you
niver
will
be
so
foolish
as
to
take
what
will
mark
with
every
drop
of
rain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sorry
you
sell
such
good
-
for
-
nothing
things
,
"
replied
Sylvia
,
conscious
of
her
advantage
,
and
relaxing
a
little
(
as
little
as
she
possibly
could
)
of
her
gravity
.
  
<EOS>
Hester
came
in
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
means
to
say
that
this
cloth
will
lose
its
first
brightness
in
wet
or
damp
;
but
it
will
always
be
a
good
article
,
and
the
colour
will
stand
a
deal
of
wear
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Foster
would
not
have
had
it
in
his
shop
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
did
not
like
that
even
a
reasonable
peace
-
making
interpreter
should
come
between
him
and
Sylvia
,
so
he
held
his
tongue
in
indignant
silence
.
  
<EOS>
Hester
went
on
:
  
"
To
be
sure
,
this
gray
is
the
closer
make
,
and
would
wear
the
longest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
still
rejecting
the
dull
gray
.
<EOS>
"
I
like
this
best
.
<EOS>
Eight
yards
,
if
you
please
,
miss
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
cloak
takes
nine
yards
,
at
least
,
"
said
Philip
,
decisively
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
told
me
eight
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
secretly
conscious
that
her
mother
would
have
preferred
the
more
sober
colour
;
and
feeling
that
as
she
had
had
her
own
way
in
that
respect
,
she
was
bound
to
keep
to
the
directions
she
had
received
as
to
the
quantity
.
<EOS>
But
,
indeed
,
she
would
not
have
yielded
to
Philip
in
anything
that
she
could
help
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
sound
of
children
's
feet
running
up
the
street
from
the
river
-
side
,
shouting
with
excitement
.
<EOS>
At
the
noise
,
Sylvia
forgot
her
cloak
and
her
little
spirit
of
vexation
,
and
ran
to
the
half
-
door
of
the
shop
.
<EOS>
Philip
followed
because
she
went
.
<EOS>
Hester
looked
on
with
passive
,
kindly
interest
,
as
soon
as
she
had
completed
her
duty
of
measuring
.
<EOS>
One
of
those
girls
whom
Sylvia
had
seen
as
she
and
Molly
left
the
crowd
on
the
quay
,
came
quickly
up
the
street
.
<EOS>
Her
face
,
which
was
handsome
enough
as
to
feature
,
was
whitened
with
excess
of
passionate
emotion
,
her
dress
untidy
and
flying
,
her
movements
heavy
and
free
.
<EOS>
She
belonged
to
the
lowest
class
of
seaport
inhabitants
.
<EOS>
As
she
came
near
,
Sylvia
saw
that
the
tears
were
streaming
down
her
cheeks
,
quite
unconsciously
to
herself
.
<EOS>
She
recognized
Sylvia
's
face
,
full
of
interest
as
it
was
,
and
stopped
her
clumsy
run
to
speak
to
the
pretty
,
sympathetic
creature
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
o'er
t
'
bar
!
<EOS>
She
's
o'er
t
'
bar
!
<EOS>
I
'm
boun
'
to
tell
mother
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
caught
at
Sylvia
's
hand
,
and
shook
it
,
and
went
on
breathless
and
gasping
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sylvia
,
how
came
you
to
know
that
girl
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Philip
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
She
's
not
one
for
you
to
be
shaking
hands
with
.
<EOS>
She
's
known
all
down
t
'
quay
-
side
as
"
Newcastle
Bess
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
ca
n't
help
it
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
half
inclined
to
cry
at
his
manner
even
more
than
his
words
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
When
folk
are
glad
I
ca
n't
help
being
glad
too
,
and
I
just
put
out
my
hand
,
and
she
put
out
hers
.
<EOS>
To
think
o
'
yon
ship
come
in
at
last
!
<EOS>
And
if
yo'd
been
down
seeing
all
t
'
folk
looking
and
looking
their
eyes
out
,
as
if
they
feared
they
should
die
afore
she
came
in
and
brought
home
the
lads
they
loved
,
yo'd
ha
'
shaken
hands
<EOS>
wi
'
that
lass
too
,
and
no
great
harm
done
.
<EOS>
I
never
set
eyne
upon
her
till
half
an
hour
ago
on
th
'
staithes
,
and
maybe
I
'll
niver
see
her
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hester
was
still
behind
the
counter
,
but
had
moved
so
as
to
be
near
the
window
;
so
she
heard
what
they
were
saying
,
and
now
put
in
her
word
:
  
<EOS>
"
She
ca
n't
be
altogether
bad
,
for
she
thought
<EOS>
o
'
telling
her
mother
first
thing
,
according
to
what
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
  
Sylvia
gave
Hester
a
quick
,
grateful
look
.
<EOS>
But
Hester
had
resumed
her
gaze
out
of
the
window
,
and
did
not
see
the
glance
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
Molly
Corney
joined
them
,
hastily
bursting
into
the
shop
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hech
!
"
said
she
.
"
<EOS>
Hearken
!
<EOS>
how
they
're
crying
and
shouting
down
on
t
'
quay
.
<EOS>
T
'
gang
's
among
'em
like
t
'
day
of
judgment
.
<EOS>
Hark
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
No
one
spoke
,
<EOS>
no
one
breathed
<EOS>
,
I
had
almost
said
no
heart
beat
for
listening
.
<EOS>
Not
long
;
in
an
instant
there
rose
the
sharp
simultaneous
cry
of
many
people
in
rage
and
despair
.
<EOS>
Inarticulate
at
that
distance
,
it
was
yet
an
intelligible
curse
,
and
the
roll
,
and
the
roar
,
and
the
irregular
tramp
came
nearer
and
nearer
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
're
taking
'em
to
t
'
Randyvowse
,
"
said
Molly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Eh
!
<EOS>
I
wish
I
'd
King
George
here
just
to
tell
him
my
mind
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
girl
clenched
her
hands
,
and
set
her
teeth
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
terrible
hard
!
"
<EOS>
said
Hester
;
"
there
's
mothers
,
and
wives
,
looking
out
for
'em
,
as
if
they
were
stars
dropt
out
o
'
t
'
lift
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
can
we
do
nothing
for
'
em
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
go
into
t
'
thick
of
it
and
do
a
bit
of
help
;
I
ca
n't
stand
quiet
and
see
'
t
!
"
<EOS>
Half
crying
,
she
pushed
forwards
to
the
door
;
but
Philip
held
her
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sylvie
!
<EOS>
you
must
not
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
silly
;
it
's
the
law
,
and
no
one
can
do
aught
against
it
,
least
of
all
women
and
lasses
.
  
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
vanguard
of
the
crowd
came
pressing
up
Bridge
Street
,
past
the
windows
of
Foster
's
shop
.
<EOS>
It
consisted
of
wild
,
half
-
amphibious
boys
,
slowly
moving
backwards
,
as
they
were
compelled
by
the
pressure
of
the
coming
multitude
to
go
on
,
and
yet
anxious
to
defy
and
annoy
the
gang
by
insults
,
and
curses
half
choked
with
their
indignant
passion
,
doubling
their
fists
in
the
very
faces
of
the
gang
who
came
on
with
measured
movement
,
armed
to
the
teeth
,
their
faces
showing
white
with
repressed
and
determined
energy
against
the
bronzed
countenances
of
the
half
-
dozen
sailors
,
who
were
all
they
had
thought
it
wise
to
pick
out
of
the
whaler
's
crew
,
<EOS>
this
being
the
first
time
an
Admiralty
warrant
had
been
used
in
Monkshaven
for
many
years
;
not
since
the
close
of
the
American
war
,
in
fact
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
men
was
addressing
to
his
townspeople
,
in
a
high
pitched
voice
,
an
exhortation
which
few
could
hear
,
for
,
pressing
around
this
nucleus
of
cruel
wrong
,
were
women
crying
aloud
,
throwing
up
their
arms
in
imprecation
,
showering
down
abuse
as
hearty
and
rapid
as
if
they
had
been
a
Greek
chorus
.
<EOS>
Their
wild
,
famished
eyes
were
strained
on
faces
they
might
not
kiss
,
their
cheeks
were
flushed
to
purple
with
anger
or
else
<EOS>
livid
with
impotent
craving
for
revenge
.
<EOS>
Some
of
them
looked
scarce
human
;
and
yet
an
hour
ago
these
lips
,
now
tightly
drawn
back
so
as
to
show
the
teeth
with
the
unconscious
action
of
an
enraged
wild
animal
,
had
been
soft
and
gracious
with
the
smile
of
hope
;
eyes
,
that
were
fiery
and
bloodshot
now
,
had
been
loving
and
bright
;
hearts
,
never
to
recover
from
the
sense
of
injustice
and
cruelty
,
had
been
trustful
and
glad
only
one
short
hour
ago
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
men
there
,
too
,
sullen
and
silent
,
brooding
on
remedial
revenge
;
but
not
many
,
the
greater
proportion
of
this
class
being
away
in
the
absent
whalers
.
  
<EOS>
The
stormy
multitude
swelled
into
the
market
-
place
and
formed
a
solid
crowd
there
,
while
the
press
-
gang
steadily
forced
their
way
on
into
High
Street
,
and
on
to
the
rendezvous
.
<EOS>
A
low
,
deep
growl
went
up
from
the
dense
mass
,
as
some
had
to
wait
for
space
to
follow
the
others
 
now
and
then
going
up
,
as
a
lion
's
growl
goes
up
,
into
a
shriek
of
rage
.
  
<EOS>
A
woman
forced
her
way
up
from
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
She
lived
some
little
way
in
the
country
,
and
had
been
late
in
hearing
of
the
return
of
the
whaler
after
her
six
months
'
absence
;
and
on
rushing
down
to
the
quay
-
side
,
she
had
been
told
by
a
score
of
busy
,
sympathizing
voices
,
that
her
husband
was
kidnapped
for
the
service
of
the
Government
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
need
pause
in
the
market
-
place
,
the
outlet
of
which
was
crammed
up
.
<EOS>
Then
she
gave
tongue
for
the
first
time
in
such
a
fearful
shriek
,
you
could
hardly
catch
the
words
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jamie
!
<EOS>
Jamie
!
<EOS>
will
they
not
let
you
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
Those
were
the
last
words
Sylvia
heard
before
her
own
hysterical
burst
of
tears
called
every
one
's
attention
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
been
very
busy
about
household
work
in
the
morning
,
and
much
agitated
by
all
she
had
seen
and
heard
since
coming
into
Monkshaven
;
and
so
it
ended
in
this
.
  
<EOS>
Molly
and
Hester
took
her
through
the
shop
into
the
parlour
beyond
 
John
Foster
's
parlour
,
for
Jeremiah
,
the
elder
brother
,
lived
in
a
house
of
his
own
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
low
,
comfortable
room
,
with
great
beams
running
across
the
ceiling
,
and
papered
with
the
same
paper
as
the
walls
 
a
piece
of
elegant
luxury
which
took
Molly
's
fancy
mightily
!
<EOS>
This
parlour
looked
out
on
the
dark
courtyard
in
which
there
grew
two
or
three
poplars
,
straining
upwards
to
the
light
;
and
through
an
open
door
between
the
backs
of
two
houses
could
be
seen
a
glimpse
of
the
dancing
,
heaving
river
,
with
such
ships
or
fishing
cobles
as
happened
to
be
moored
in
the
waters
above
the
bridge
.
  
<EOS>
They
placed
Sylvia
on
the
broad
,
old
-
fashioned
sofa
,
and
gave
her
water
to
drink
,
and
tried
to
still
her
sobbing
and
choking
.
<EOS>
They
loosed
her
hat
,
and
copiously
splashed
her
face
and
clustering
chestnut
hair
,
till
at
length
she
came
to
herself
;
restored
,
but
dripping
wet
.
<EOS>
She
sate
up
and
looked
at
them
,
smoothing
back
her
tangled
curls
off
her
brow
,
as
if
to
clear
both
her
eyes
and
her
intellect
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
am
I
?
 
<EOS>
oh
,
I
know
!
<EOS>
Thank
you
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
silly
,
but
somehow
it
seemed
so
sad
!
"
  
<EOS>
And
here
she
was
nearly
going
off
again
,
but
Hester
said
    
"
<EOS>
Ay
,
it
were
sad
,
my
poor
lass
 
if
I
may
call
you
so
,
for
I
do
n't
rightly
know
your
name
 
<EOS>
but
it
's
best
not
think
on
it
for
we
can
do
no
mak
'
<EOS>
o
'
good
,
and
it
'll
mebbe
set
you
off
again
.
<EOS>
Yo're
Philip
Hepburn
's
cousin
,
I
reckon
,
and
yo
'
bide
at
Haytersbank
Farm
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
she
's
Sylvia
Robson
,
"
put
in
Molly
,
not
seeing
that
Hester
's
purpose
was
to
make
Sylvia
speak
,
and
so
to
divert
her
attention
from
the
subject
which
had
set
her
off
into
hysterics
.
"
<EOS>
And
we
came
in
for
market
,
"
continued
Molly
,
"
and
for
t
'
buy
t
'
new
cloak
as
her
feyther
's
going
to
give
her
;
and
,
for
sure
,
I
thought
we
was
<EOS>
i
'
luck
's
way
when
we
saw
t
'
first
whaler
,
and
niver
dreaming
as
<EOS>
t
'
press
-
gang
'
ud
be
so
marred
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
,
too
,
began
to
cry
,
but
her
little
whimper
was
stopped
by
the
sound
of
the
opening
door
behind
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
Philip
,
asking
Hester
by
a
silent
gesture
if
he
might
come
in
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
turned
her
face
round
from
the
light
,
and
shut
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
Her
cousin
came
close
up
to
her
on
tip
-
toe
,
and
looked
anxiously
at
what
he
could
see
of
her
averted
face
;
then
he
passed
his
hand
so
slightly
over
her
hair
that
he
could
scarcely
be
said
to
touch
it
,
and
murmured
    
"
Poor
lassie
!
<EOS>
it
's
a
pity
she
came
to
-
day
,
for
it
's
a
long
walk
in
this
heat
!
"
  
<EOS>
But
Sylvia
started
to
her
feet
,
almost
pushing
him
along
.
<EOS>
Her
quickened
senses
heard
an
approaching
step
through
the
courtyard
before
any
of
the
others
were
aware
of
the
sound
.
<EOS>
In
a
minute
afterwards
,
the
glass
-
door
at
one
corner
of
the
parlour
was
opened
from
the
outside
,
and
Mr.
John
stood
looking
in
with
some
surprise
at
the
group
collected
in
his
usually
empty
parlour
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
my
cousin
,
"
said
Philip
,
reddening
a
little
;
"
she
came
wi
'
her
friend
in
to
market
,
and
to
make
purchases
;
and
she
's
got
a
turn
wi
'
seeing
the
press
-
gang
go
past
carrying
some
of
the
crew
of
the
whaler
to
the
Randyvowse
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
"
said
Mr.
John
,
quickly
passing
on
into
the
shop
on
tip
-
toe
,
as
if
he
were
afraid
he
were
intruding
in
his
own
premises
,
and
beckoning
Philip
to
follow
him
there
.
<EOS>
"
Out
of
strife
cometh
strife
.
<EOS>
I
guessed
something
of
the
sort
was
up
from
what
I
heard
on
t
'
bridge
as
I
came
across
fra
'
brother
Jeremiah
's
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
he
softly
shut
the
door
between
the
parlour
and
the
shop
.
<EOS>
"
It
beareth
hard
on
th
'
expectant
women
and
childer
;
nor
is
it
to
be
wondered
at
that
they
,
being
unconverted
,
rage
together
(
poor
creatures
!
)
<EOS>
like
the
very
heathen
.
<EOS>
Philip
,
"
he
said
,
coming
nearer
to
his
"
head
young
man
,
"
"
keep
Nicholas
and
Henry
at
work
in
the
ware
-
room
upstairs
until
this
riot
be
over
,
for
it
would
grieve
me
if
they
were
misled
into
violence
.
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
hesitated
.
  
<EOS>
"
Speak
out
,
man
!
<EOS>
Always
ease
an
uneasy
heart
,
and
never
let
it
get
hidebound
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
thought
to
convoy
my
cousin
and
the
other
young
woman
home
,
for
the
town
<EOS>
is
like
to
be
rough
,
and
it
's
getting
dark
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
thou
shalt
,
my
lad
,
"
said
the
good
old
man
;
"
and
I
myself
will
try
and
restrain
the
natural
inclinations
of
Nicholas
and
Henry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
when
he
went
to
find
the
shop
-
boys
with
a
gentle
homily
on
his
lips
,
those
to
whom
it
should
have
been
addressed
were
absent
.
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
the
riotous
state
of
things
,
all
the
other
shops
in
the
market
-
place
had
put
their
shutters
up
;
and
Nicholas
and
Henry
,
in
the
absence
of
their
superiors
,
had
followed
the
example
of
their
neighbours
,
and
,
as
business
was
over
,
they
had
hardly
waited
to
put
the
goods
away
,
but
had
hurried
off
to
help
their
townsmen
in
any
struggle
that
might
ensue
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
remedy
for
it
,
but
Mr.
John
looked
rather
discomfited
.
<EOS>
The
state
of
the
counters
,
and
of
the
disarranged
goods
,
was
such
also
as
would
have
irritated
any
man
as
orderly
but
less
sweet
-
tempered
.
<EOS>
All
he
said
on
the
subject
was
:
"
The
old
Adam
!
<EOS>
the
old
Adam
!
"
<EOS>
but
he
shook
his
head
long
after
he
had
finished
speaking
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
William
Coulson
?
"
<EOS>
he
next
asked
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
remember
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
to
come
back
from
York
till
the
night
closed
in
.
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
and
his
master
arranged
the
shop
in
the
exact
order
the
old
man
loved
.
<EOS>
Then
he
recollected
the
wish
of
his
subordinate
,
and
turned
round
and
said
    
"
Now
go
with
thy
cousin
and
her
friend
.
<EOS>
Hester
is
here
,
and
old
Hannah
.
<EOS>
I
myself
will
take
Hester
home
,
if
need
be
.
<EOS>
But
for
the
present
I
think
she
had
best
tarry
here
,
as
it
is
n't
many
steps
to
her
mother
's
house
,
and
we
may
need
her
help
if
any
of
those
poor
creatures
fall
into
suffering
wi
'
their
violence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
this
,
Mr.
John
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
parlour
,
and
waited
for
permission
to
enter
.
<EOS>
With
old
-
fashioned
courtesy
he
told
the
two
strangers
how
glad
he
was
that
his
room
had
been
of
service
to
them
;
that
he
would
never
have
made
so
bold
as
to
pass
through
it
,
if
he
had
been
aware
how
it
was
occupied
.
<EOS>
And
then
going
to
a
corner
cupboard
,
high
up
in
the
wall
,
he
pulled
a
key
out
of
his
pocket
and
unlocked
his
little
store
of
wine
,
and
cake
,
and
spirits
;
and
insisted
that
they
should
eat
and
drink
while
waiting
for
Philip
,
who
was
taking
some
last
measures
for
the
security
of
the
shop
during
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
declined
everything
,
with
less
courtesy
than
she
ought
to
have
shown
to
the
offers
of
the
hospitable
old
man
.
<EOS>
Molly
took
wine
and
cake
,
leaving
a
good
half
of
both
,
according
to
the
code
of
manners
in
that
part
of
the
country
;
and
also
because
Sylvia
was
continually
urging
her
to
make
haste
.
<EOS>
For
the
latter
disliked
the
idea
of
her
cousin
's
esteeming
it
necessary
to
accompany
them
home
,
and
wanted
to
escape
from
him
by
setting
off
before
he
returned
.
<EOS>
But
any
such
plans
were
frustrated
by
Philip
's
coming
back
into
the
parlour
,
full
of
grave
content
,
which
brimmed
over
from
his
eyes
,
with
the
parcel
of
Sylvia
's
obnoxious
red
duffle
under
his
arm
;
anticipating
so
keenly
the
pleasure
awaiting
him
in
the
walk
,
that
he
was
almost
surprised
by
the
gravity
of
his
companions
as
they
prepared
for
it
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
was
a
little
penitent
for
her
rejection
of
Mr.
John
's
hospitality
,
now
she
found
out
how
unavailing
for
its
purpose
such
rejection
had
been
,
and
tried
to
make
up
by
a
modest
sweetness
of
farewell
,
which
quite
won
his
heart
,
and
made
him
praise
her
up
to
Hester
in
a
way
to
which
she
,
observant
of
all
,
could
not
bring
herself
fully
to
respond
.
<EOS>
What
business
had
the
pretty
little
creature
to
reject
kindly
-
meant
hospitality
in
the
pettish
way
she
did
,
thought
Hester
.
<EOS>
And
,
oh
!
<EOS>
what
business
had
she
to
be
so
ungrateful
and
to
try
and
thwart
Philip
in
his
thoughtful
wish
of
escorting
them
through
the
streets
of
the
rough
,
riotous
town
?
<EOS>
What
did
it
all
mean
?
    
<EOS>
PHILIP
HEPBURN
  
<EOS>
The
coast
on
that
part
of
the
island
to
which
this
story
refers
is
bordered
by
rocks
and
cliffs
.
<EOS>
The
inland
country
immediately
adjacent
to
the
coast
is
level
,
flat
,
and
bleak
;
it
is
only
where
the
long
stretch
of
dyke
-
enclosed
fields
terminates
abruptly
in
a
sheer
descent
,
and
the
stranger
sees
the
ocean
creeping
up
the
sands
far
below
him
,
that
he
is
aware
on
how
great
an
elevation
he
has
been
.
<EOS>
Here
and
there
,
as
I
have
said
,
a
cleft
in
the
level
land
(
thus
running
out
into
the
sea
in
steep
promontories
)
occurs
 
what
they
would
call
a
"
chine
"
in
the
Isle
of
Wight
;
but
instead
of
the
soft
south
wind
stealing
up
the
woody
ravine
,
as
it
does
there
,
the
eastern
breeze
comes
piping
shrill
and
clear
along
these
northern
chasms
,
keeping
the
trees
that
venture
to
grow
on
the
sides
down
to
the
mere
height
of
scrubby
brushwood
.
<EOS>
The
descent
to
the
shore
through
these
"
bottoms
"
is
in
most
cases
very
abrupt
,
too
much
so
for
a
cartway
,
or
even
a
bridle
-
path
;
but
people
can
pass
up
and
down
without
difficulty
,
by
the
help
of
a
few
rude
steps
hewn
here
and
there
out
of
the
rock
.
  
<EOS>
Sixty
or
seventy
years
ago
(
not
to
speak
of
much
later
times
)
<EOS>
the
farmers
who
owned
or
hired
the
land
which
lay
directly
on
the
summit
of
these
cliffs
were
smugglers
to
the
extent
of
their
power
,
only
partially
checked
by
the
coast
-
guard
distributed
,
at
pretty
nearly
equal
interspaces
of
eight
miles
,
all
along
the
north
-
eastern
seaboard
.
<EOS>
Still
sea
-
wrack
was
a
good
manure
,
and
there
was
no
law
against
carrying
it
up
in
great
osier
baskets
for
the
purpose
of
tillage
,
and
many
a
secret
thing
was
lodged
in
hidden
crevices
in
the
rocks
till
the
farmer
sent
trusty
people
down
to
the
shore
for
a
good
supply
of
sand
and
seaweed
for
his
land
.
  
<EOS>
One
of
the
farms
on
the
cliff
had
lately
been
taken
by
Sylvia
's
father
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
who
had
roamed
about
a
good
deal
 
<EOS>
been
sailor
,
smuggler
,
horse
-
dealer
,
and
farmer
in
turns
;
a
sort
of
fellow
possessed
by
a
spirit
of
adventure
and
love
of
change
,
which
did
him
and
his
own
family
more
harm
than
anybody
else
.
<EOS>
He
was
just
the
kind
of
man
that
all
his
neighbours
found
fault
with
,
and
all
his
neighbours
liked
.
<EOS>
Late
in
life
(
for
such
an
imprudent
man
as
he
,
was
one
of
a
class
who
generally
we
d
,
trusting
to
chance
and
luck
for
the
provision
for
a
family
)
,
farmer
Robson
married
a
woman
whose
only
want
of
practical
wisdom
consisted
in
taking
him
for
a
husband
.
<EOS>
She
was
Philip
Hepburn
's
aunt
,
and
had
had
the
charge
of
him
until
she
married
from
her
widowed
brother
's
house
.
<EOS>
He
<EOS>
it
was
who
had
let
her
know
when
Haytersbank
Farm
had
been
to
let
;
esteeming
it
a
likely
piece
of
land
for
his
uncle
to
settle
down
upon
,
after
a
somewhat
unprosperous
career
of
horse
-
dealing
.
<EOS>
The
farmhouse
lay
in
the
shelter
of
a
very
slight
green
hollow
scarcely
scooped
out
of
the
pasture
field
by
which
it
was
surrounded
;
the
short
crisp
turf
came
creeping
up
to
the
very
door
and
windows
,
without
any
attempt
at
a
yard
or
garden
,
or
any
nearer
enclosure
of
the
buildings
than
the
stone
dyke
that
formed
the
boundary
of
the
field
itself
.
<EOS>
The
buildings
were
long
and
low
,
in
order
to
avoid
the
rough
violence
of
the
winds
that
swept
over
that
wild
,
bleak
spot
,
both
in
winter
and
summer
.
<EOS>
It
was
well
for
the
inhabitants
of
that
house
that
coal
was
extremely
cheap
;
otherwise
a
southerner
might
have
imagined
that
they
could
never
have
survived
the
cutting
of
the
bitter
gales
that
piped
all
round
,
and
seemed
to
seek
out
every
crevice
for
admission
into
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
interior
was
warm
enough
when
once
you
had
mounted
the
long
bleak
lane
,
full
of
round
rough
stones
,
enough
to
lame
any
horse
unaccustomed
to
such
roads
,
and
had
crossed
the
field
by
the
little
dry
,
hard
footpath
,
which
tacked
about
so
as
to
keep
from
directly
facing
the
prevailing
wind
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Robson
was
a
Cumberland
woman
,
and
as
such
,
was
a
cleaner
housewife
than
the
farmers
'
wives
of
that
north
-
eastern
coast
,
and
was
often
shocked
at
their
ways
,
showing
it
more
by
her
looks
than
by
her
words
,
for
she
was
not
a
great
talker
.
<EOS>
This
fastidiousness
in
such
matters
made
her
own
house
extremely
comfortable
,
but
did
not
tend
to
render
her
popular
among
her
neighbours
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Bell
Robson
piqued
herself
on
her
housekeeping
generally
,
and
once
in
-
doors
in
the
gray
,
bare
stone
house
,
there
were
plenty
of
comforts
to
be
had
besides
cleanliness
and
warmth
.
<EOS>
The
great
rack
of
clap
-
bread
hung
overhead
,
and
Bell
Robson
's
preference
of
this
kind
of
oat
-
cake
over
the
leavened
and
partly
sour
kind
used
in
Yorkshire
was
another
source
of
her
unpopularity
.
<EOS>
Flitches
of
bacon
and
"
hands
"
(
_
<EOS>
i.e.
_
,
shoulders
of
cured
pork
,
the
legs
or
hams
being
sold
,
as
fetching
a
better
price
)
abounded
;
and
for
any
visitor
who
could
stay
,
neither
cream
nor
finest
wheaten
flour
was
wanting
for
"
turf
cakes
"
and
"
singing
hinnies
,
"
with
which
it
is
the
delight
of
the
northern
housewives
to
regale
the
honoured
guest
,
as
he
sips
their
high
-
priced
tea
,
sweetened
with
dainty
sugar
.
  
<EOS>
This
night
farmer
Robson
was
fidgeting
in
and
out
of
his
house
-
door
,
climbing
the
little
eminence
in
the
field
,
and
coming
down
disappointed
in
a
state
of
fretful
impatience
.
<EOS>
His
quiet
,
taciturn
wife
was
a
little
put
out
by
Sylvia
's
non
-
appearance
too
;
but
she
showed
her
anxiety
by
being
shorter
than
usual
in
her
replies
to
his
perpetual
wonders
as
to
where
the
lass
could
have
been
tarrying
,
and
by
knitting
away
with
extra
diligence
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
a

"
No

said
his

;

said
Daniel

querulously
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
afeard

replied
Bell
.

"
<EOS>
He
's
a
good

i

th

Before
Mrs.
Robson
,
however
,
had
put
away
her
knitting
,
voices
were
heard
at
a
good
distance
down
the
lane
,
but
coming
nearer
every
moment
,
and
once
more
Daniel
climbed
the
little
brow
to
look
and
to
listen
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
'
reet
!
"
<EOS>
said
he
,
hobbling
quickly
down
.
"
<EOS>
Niver

<EOS>
I
'll
tak
'
thee
a
bet
<EOS>
it
's
Philip
Hepburn
's
voice
,
convoying
her
home
,
just
as
I
said
he
would
,
an
hour
sin
'
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bell
did
not
answer
,
as
she
might
have
done
,
that
this
probability
of
Philip
's
bringing
Sylvia
home
had
been
her
own
suggestion
,
set
aside
by
her
husband
as
utterly
unlikely
.
<EOS>
Another
minute
and
the
countenances
of
both
parents
imperceptibly
and
unconsciously
relaxed
into
pleasure
as
Sylvia
came
in
.
  
<EOS>
She
looked
very
rosy
from
the
walk
,
and
the
October
air
,
which
began
to
be
frosty
in
the
evenings
;
there
was
a
little
cloud
over
her
face
at
first
,
but
it
was
quickly
dispersed
as
she
met
the
loving
eyes
of
home
.
<EOS>
Philip
,
who
followed
her
,
had
an
excited
,
but
not
altogether
pleased
look
about
him
.
<EOS>
He
received
a
hearty
greeting
from
Daniel
,
and
a
quiet
one
from
his
aunt
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tak
'
off
thy
pan
o
'
milk
,
missus
,
and
set

'
kettle
.
<EOS>
Milk
may
do
for
wenches
,
but
Philip
and
me
is
for
a
drop
o
'
good
Hollands
and
watter
this
cold
night
.
<EOS>
I
'm
a'most
chilled
to
t

<EOS>
marrow
<EOS>
wi

looking
out

"
  
<EOS>
This
was
entirely
untrue
,
and
Bell
knew
it
to
be
so
;
but
her
husband
did
not
.
<EOS>
He
had
persuaded
himself
now
,
as
he
had
done
often
before
,
that
what
he
had
in
reality
done
for
his
own
pleasure
or
satisfaction
,
he
had
done
in
order
to
gratify
some
one
else
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
town
was
rough
with
a
riot
between
the
press

gang
and

whaling
folk

His
face
changed
as
he
ended
his
speech
,
and
showed
a
steady
passion
of
old
hatred
.

said
he
,
speaking
crossly
to
his
wife
,
who
had
heard
the
story
scores
of
times
,
and
,
it
must
be
confessed
,
was
making
some
noise
in
preparing
bread
and
milk
for
Sylvia
's
supper
.
  
<EOS>
Bell
did
not
say
a
word
in
reply
,
but
Sylvia
tapped
his
shoulder
with
a
pretty
little
authoritative
air
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
for
me
,
feyther
.
<EOS>
I
'm
just
keen

set
for

<EOS>
Once
let
me
get
quickly
set
down
to
it
,
and
Philip
there
to
his
glass
o
'
grog
,
and
you
'll
never
have
such
listeners
in
your
life
,
and
mother
's
mind
will
be
at
ease
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
!
thou
's
a
wilfu
'
wench

"
said
the
proud
father
,
giving
her
a
great
slap
on
her
back
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
set
thee
down
to
thy
victual
,
and
be
quiet
wi

thee
,
for
I
want
to
finish
my
tale
to
Philip
.
<EOS>
But
,
perhaps
,
I
've
telled
it
yo
'
afore
?
"
<EOS>
said
he
,
turning
round
to
question
Hepburn
.
  
<EOS>
Hepburn
could
not
say
that
he
had
not
heard
it
,
for
he
piqued
himself
on
his
truthfulness
.
<EOS>
But
instead
of
frankly
and
directly
owning
this
,
he
tried
to
frame
a
formal
little
speech
,
which
would
soothe
Daniel
's
mortified
vanity
;
and
,
of
course
,
it
had
the
directly
opposite
effect
.
<EOS>
Daniel
resented
being
treated
like
a
child
,
and
yet
turned
his
back
on
Philip
with
all
the
wilfulness
of
one
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
did
not
care
for
her
cousin
,
but
hated
the
discomfort
of
having
her
father
displeased
;
so
she
took
up
her
tale
of
adventure
,
and
told
her
father
and
mother
of
her
afternoon
's
proceedings
.
<EOS>
Daniel
pretended
not
to
listen
at
first
,
and
made
ostentatious
noises
with
his
spoon
and
glass
;
but
by
-
and
-
by
he
got
quite
warm
and
excited
about
the
doings

and
scolded
both
Philip
and
Sylvia
for
not
having
learnt
more
particulars
as
to
what
was
the
termination
of
the

<EOS>
"
I
've
been
whaling
mysel

,
"
said
he
;
"
<EOS>
and
I
've
heerd
tell
as
whalers
wear
knives
,
and
I
'd
ha

gi'en
t

<EOS>
a
taste
<EOS>
o

my
whittle
,
if
I
'd
been
cotched
up
just
as
I
'd
set
my
foot
a

shore
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
Philip
;
"
we
're
at
war
wi
'
the
French
,
and
we
should
n't
like
to
be
beaten
;
and
yet
if
our
numbers
are
not
equal
to
theirs
,
we
stand
a
strong
chance
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
bit
on't
 
so
be
d
 
d
!
"
said
Daniel
Robson
,
bringing
down
his
fist
with
such
violence
on
the
round
deal
table
,
that
the
glasses
and
earthenware
shook
again
.
"
<EOS>
Yo'd
not
strike
a
child
or
a
woman
,
for
sure
!
<EOS>
yet
it
'
ud
be
like
it
,
if
we
did
na
'
give
the
Frenchies
some
'
vantages
 
if
we
took
'em
wi
'
equal
numbers
.
<EOS>
It
's
not
fair
play
,
and
that
's
one
place
where
t
'
shoe
pinches
.
<EOS>
It
's
not
fair
play
two
ways
.
<EOS>
It
's
not
fair
play
to
cotch
up
men
as
has
no
call
for
fightin
'
at
another
man
's
biddin
'
,
though
they
've
no
objection
to
fight
a
bit
on
their
own
account
and
who
are
just
landed
,
all
keen
after
bread
i'stead
o
'
biscuit
,
and
flesh
-
meat
i'stead
o
'
junk
,
and
beds
i'stead
o
'
hammocks
.
<EOS>
(
I
make
naught
<EOS>
o
'
t
'
sentiment
side
,
for
I
were
niver
gi'en
up
to
such
carnal
-
mindedness
and
poesies
.
)
<EOS>
It
's
noane
fair
to
cotch
'em
up
and
put
'em
in
a
stifling
hole
,
all
lined
with
metal
for
fear
they
should
whittle
their
way
out
,
and
send
'em
off
to
sea
for
years
an
'
years
to
come
.
<EOS>
And
again
it
's
no
fair
play
to
t
'
French
.
<EOS>
Four
o
'
them
is
rightly
matched
wi
'
one
o
'
us
;
and
if
we
go
an
'
fight
'em
four
to
four
<EOS>
it
's
like
as
if
yo
'
fell
to
beatin
'
Sylvie
there
,
or
<EOS>
little
Billy
Croxton
,
as
is
n't
breeched
.
<EOS>
And
that
's
my
mind
.
<EOS>
Missus
,
where
's
t
'
pipe
?
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
did
not
smoke
,
so
took
his
turn
at
talking
,
a
chance
he
seldom
had
with
Daniel
,
unless
the
latter
had
his
pipe
between
his
lips
.
<EOS>
So
after
Daniel
had
filled
it
,
and
used
Sylvia
's
little
finger
as
a
stopper
to
ram
down
the
tobacco
 
<EOS>
a
habit
of
his
to
which
she
was
so
accustomed
that
she
laid
her
hand
on
the
table
by
him
,
as
naturally
as
she
would
have
fetched
him
his
spittoon
when
he
began
to
smoke
 
Philip
arranged
his
arguments
,
and
began
    
"
I
'm
for
fair
play
wi
'
the
French
as
much
as
any
man
,
as
long
as
we
can
be
sure
o
'
beating
them
;
but
<EOS>
,
I
say
,
make
sure
o
'
that
,
and
then
give
them
ivery
advantage
.
<EOS>
Now
I
reckon
Government
is
not
sure
as
yet
,
for
i
'
the
papers
it
said
as
half
th
'
ships
<EOS>
i
'
th
'
<EOS>
Channel
had
n't
got
their
proper
complement
o
'
men
;
and
all
as
I
say
is
,
let
Government
judge
a
bit
for
us
;
and
if
they
say
they
're
hampered
for
want
o
'
men
,
why
we
must
make
it
up
somehow
.
<EOS>
John
and
Jeremiah
Foster
pay
in
taxes
,
and
Militiaman
pays
in
person
;
and
if
sailors
can
not
pay
in
taxes
,
and
will
not
pay
in
person
,
why
they
must
be
made
to
pay
;
and
that
's
what
th
<EOS>
'
press
-
gang
is
for
,
I
reckon
.
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
when
I
read
o
'
the
way
those
French
chaps
are
going
on
,
I
'm
thankful
to
be
governed
by
King
George
and
a
British
Constitution
.
"
  
<EOS>
Daniel
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
at
this
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
when
did
I
say
a
word
again
King
George
and
the
Constitution
?
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
only
ax
'em
to
govern
me
as
I
judge
best
,
and
that
's
what
I
call
representation
.
<EOS>
When
I
gived
my
vote
to
Measter
Cholmley
to
go
up
to
t
'
Parliament
House
,
I
as
good
as
said
,
"
<EOS>
Now
yo
'
go
up

and
tell
'em
what

and
what
I

Dannel

wish
to
have
done

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Else
I
'd
be
darned
if
I

ha

gi'en
my
vote
to
him
or
any
other
man

<EOS>
And
div

I
want
Seth
Robson
(
as
is
my

brother
's
son
,
and
mate
to
a
collier
)
to
be
cotched
up
by
a
press

gang
,
and
ten

all
unpaid

<EOS>
Div
yo

think
I
'd
send
up
Measter
Cholmley
to
speak
up
for
that
piece
o
'
work
?
<EOS>
Not
I.
"
<EOS>
He
took
up
his
pipe
again
,
shook
out
the
ashes
,
puffed
it
into
a
spark
,
and
shut
his
eyes
,
preparatory
to
listening
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
asking
pardon
,
laws
is
made
for
the
good
of
the
nation
,
not
for
your
good

mine

"
  
<EOS>
Daniel
could
not
stand
this
.
<EOS>
He
laid
down
his
pipe
,
opened
his
eyes
,
stared
straight
at
Philip
before
speaking
,
in
order
to
enforce
his
words
,
and
then
said
slowly
    
"
Nation

<EOS>
I
'm
a

he

"
  
<EOS>
Philip
,
who
sometimes
pursued
an
argument
longer
than
was
politic
for
himself
,
especially
when
he
felt
sure
of
being
on
the
conquering
side
,
did
not
see
that
Daniel
Robson
was
passing
out
of
the
indifference
of
conscious
wisdom
into
that
state
of
anger
which
ensues
when
a
question
becomes
personal
in
some
unspoken
way
.
<EOS>
Robson
had
contested
this
subject
once
or
twice
before
,
and
had
the
remembrance
of
former
disputes
to
add
to
his
present
vehemence
.
<EOS>
So
it
was
well
for
the
harmony
of
the
evening
that
Bell
and
Sylvia
returned
from
the
kitchen
to
sit
in
the
house
-
place
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
to
wash
up
the
pans
and
basins
used
for
supper
;
Sylvia
had
privately
shown
off
her
cloak
,
and
got
over
her
mother
's
shake
of
the
head
at
its
colour
with
a
coaxing
kiss
,
at
the
end
of
which
her
mother
had
adjusted
her
cap
with
a
"
There
!
<EOS>
there
!
<EOS>
ha
'
done
wi
'
thee
,
"
but
had
no
more
heart
to
show
her
disapprobation
;
and
now
they
came
back
to
their
usual
occupations
until
it
should
please
their
visitor
to
go
;
then
they
would
rake
the
fire
and
be
off
to
bed
;
for
neither
Sylvia
's
spinning
nor
Bell
's
knitting
was
worth
candle
-
light
,
and
morning
hours
are
precious
in
a
dairy
.
  
<EOS>
People
speak
of
the
way
in
which
harp
-
playing
sets
off
a
graceful
figure
;
spinning
is
almost
as
becoming
an
employment
.
<EOS>
A
woman
stands
at
the
great
wool
-
wheel
,
one
arm
extended
,
the
other
holding
the
thread
,
her
head
thrown
back
to
take
in
all
the
scope
of
her
occupation
;
or
if
it
is
the
lesser
spinning
-
wheel
for
flax
 
and
it
was
this
that
Sylvia
moved
forwards
to
-
night
 
the
pretty
sound
of
the
buzzing
,
whirring
motion
,
the
attitude
of
the
spinner
,
foot
and
hand
alike
engaged
in
the
business
 
<EOS>
the
bunch
of
gay
coloured
ribbon
that
ties
the
bundle
of
flax
on
the
rock
 
all
make
it
into
a
picturesque
piece
of
domestic
business
that
may
rival
harp
-
playing
any
day
for
the
amount
of
softness
and
grace
which
it
calls
out
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
's
cheeks
were
rather
flushed
by
the
warmth
of
the
room
after
the
frosty
air
.
<EOS>
The
blue
ribbon
with
which
she
had
thought
it
necessary
to
tie
back
her
hair
before
putting
on
her
hat
to
go
to
market
had
got
rather
loose
,
and
allowed
her
disarranged
curls
to
stray
in
a
manner
which
would
have
annoyed
her
extremely
,
if
she
had
been
upstairs
to
look
at
herself
in
the
glass
;
but
although
they
were
not
set
in
the
exact
fashion
which
Sylvia
esteemed
as
correct
,
they
looked
very
pretty
and
luxuriant
.
<EOS>
Her
little
foot
,
placed
on
the
"
traddle
"
,
was
still
encased
in
its
smartly
buckled
shoe
 
not
slightly
to
her
discomfort
,
as
she
was
unaccustomed
to
be
shod
in
walking
far
;
only
as
Philip
had
accompanied
them
home
,
neither
she
nor
Molly
had
liked
to
go
barefoot
.
<EOS>
Her
round
mottled
arm
and
ruddy
taper
hand
drew
out
the
flax
with
nimble
,
agile
motion
,
keeping
time
to
the
movement
of
the
wheel
.
<EOS>
All
this
Philip
could
see
;
the
greater
part
of
her
face
was
lost
to
him
as
she
half
averted
it
,
with
a
shy
dislike
to
the
way
in
which
she
knew
from
past
experience
that
cousin
Philip
always
stared
at
her
.
<EOS>
And
avert
it
as
she
would
she
heard
with
silent
petulance
the
harsh
screech
of
Philip
's
chair
as
he
heavily
dragged
it
on
the
stone
floor
,
sitting
on
it
all
the
while
,
and
felt
that
he
was
moving
round
so
as
to
look
at
her
as
much
as
was
in
his
power
,
without
absolutely
turning
his
back
on
either
her
father
or
mother
.
<EOS>
She
got
herself
ready
for
the
first
opportunity
of
contradiction
or
opposition
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
wench
!
<EOS>
and
has
ta
bought
this
grand
new
cloak
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
feyther
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
scarlet
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
!
<EOS>
and
what
does
mother
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
mother
's
content
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
a
little
doubting
in
her
heart
,
but
determined
to
defy
Philip
at
all
hazards
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
'll
put
up
with
it
if
it
does
na
spot
would
be
nearer
fact
,
I
'm
thinking
,
"
said
Bell
,
quietly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wanted
Sylvia
to
take
the
gray
,
"
said
Philip
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
chose
the
red
;
it
's
so
much
gayer
,
and
folk
can
see
me
the
farther
off
.
<EOS>
Feyther
likes
to
see
me
at
first
turn
<EOS>
o
'
t
'
lane
,
do
n't
yo
'
,
feyther
?
<EOS>
and
I
'll
niver
turn
out
when
it
's
boun
'
for
to
rain
,
so
it
shall
niver
get
a
spot
near
it
,
mammy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
reckoned
it
were
to
wear
i
'
bad
weather
,
"
said
Bell
.
<EOS>
"
Leastways
that
were
the
pretext
for
coaxing
feyther
out
o
'
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
said
it
in
a
kindly
tone
,
though
the
words
became
a
prudent
rather
than
a
fond
mother
.
<EOS>
But
Sylvia
understood
her
better
than
Daniel
did
as
it
appeared
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hou'd
thy
tongue
,
mother
.
<EOS>
She
niver
spoke
a
pretext
at
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
did
not
rightly
know
what
a
"
pretext
"
was
:
<EOS>
Bell
was
a
touch
better
educated
than
her
husband
,
but
he
did
not
acknowledge
this
,
and
made
a
particular
point
of
differing
from
her
whenever
she
used
a
word
beyond
his
comprehension
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
a
good
lass
at
times
;
and
if
she
liked
to
wear
a
yellow
-
orange
cloak
she
should
have
it
.
<EOS>
Here
's
Philip
here
,
as
stands
up
for
laws
and
press
-
gangs
,
I
'll
set
him
to
find
us
a
law
again
pleasing
our
lass
;
and
she
our
only
one
.
<EOS>
Thou
dostn't
think
on
that
,
mother
!
  
<EOS>
Bell
did
think
of
that
often
;
oftener
than
her
husband
,
perhaps
,
for
she
remembered
every
day
,
and
many
times
a
day
,
the
little
one
that
had
been
born
and
had
died
while
its
father
was
away
on
some
long
voyage
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
her
way
to
make
replies
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
,
who
had
more
insight
into
her
mother
's
heart
than
Daniel
,
broke
in
with
a
new
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
as
for
Philip
,
he
's
been
preaching
up
laws
all
t
'
way
home
.
<EOS>
I
said
naught
,
but
let
Molly
hold
her
own
;
or
else
<EOS>
I
could
ha
'
told
a
tale
about
silks
an
'
lace
an
'
things
.
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
's
face
flushed
.
<EOS>
Not
because
of
the
smuggling
;
every
one
did
that
,
only
it
was
considered
polite
to
ignore
it
;
but
he
was
annoyed
to
perceive
how
quickly
his
little
cousin
had
discovered
that
his
practice
did
not
agree
with
his
preaching
,
and
vexed
,
too
,
to
see
how
delighted
she
was
to
bring
out
the
fact
.
<EOS>
He
had
some
little
idea
,
too
,
that
his
uncle
might
make
use
of
his
practice
as
an
argument
against
the
preaching
he
had
lately
been
indulging
in
,
in
opposition
to
Daniel
;
but
Daniel
was
too
far
gone
in
his
Hollands
-
and
-
water
to
do
more
than
enunciate
his
own
opinions
,
which
he
did
with
hesitating
and
laboured
distinctness
in
the
following
sentence
:
  
<EOS>
"
What
I
think
and
say
is
this
.
<EOS>
Laws
is
made
for
to
keep
some
folks
fra
'
harming

me
fra

getting
what
I
want
.
<EOS>
Theerefore
,
what
I
think
and
say
is
this
:
Measter
Cholmley
should
put
down
press
-
gangs
and
coast
-
guards
.
<EOS>
If
that
theere
is
n't
reason
<EOS>
I
ax
yo
'
to
tell
me
what
is
?
<EOS>
an
'
if
Measter
Cholmley
do
n't
do
what
I
ax
him
,
he
may
go
whistle
for
my
vote
,
he
may
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
At
this
period
in
his
conversation
,
Bell
Robson
interfered
;
not
in
the
least
from
any
feeling
of
disgust
or
annoyance
,
or
dread
of
what
he
might
say
or
do
if
he
went
on
drinking
,
but
simply
as
a
matter
of
health
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
,
too
,
was
in
no
way
annoyed
;
not
only
with
her
father
,
but
with
every
man
whom
she
knew
,
excepting
her
cousin
Philip
,
was
it
a
matter
of
course
to
drink
till
their
ideas
became
confused
.
<EOS>
So
she
simply
put
her
wheel
aside
,
as
preparatory
to
going
to
bed
,
when
her
mother
said
,
in
a
more
decided
tone
than
that
which
she
had
used
on
any
other
occasion
but
this
,
and
similar
ones
    
<EOS>
"
Come
,
measter
<EOS>
,
you
've
had
as
much
as
is
good
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
a
'
be
!
<EOS>
Let
a
'
be
,
"
said
he
,
clutching
at
the
bottle
of
spirits
,
but
perhaps
rather
more
good
-
humoured
with
what
he
had
drunk
than
he
was
before
;
he
jerked
a
little
more
into
his
glass
before
his
wife
carried
it
off
,
and
locked
it
up
in
the
cupboard
,
putting
the
key
in
her
pocket
,
and
then
he
said
,
winking
at
Philip
    
<EOS>
"
Eh
!
<EOS>
my
man
.
<EOS>
Niver
gie
a
woman

'

Yo

but
for

that
I
'll
vote
for
Cholmley
,
an
'
d####t
'
press
-
gang
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
to
shout
out
the
last
after
Philip
,
for
Hepburn
,
really
anxious
to
please
his
aunt
,
and
disliking
drinking
habits
himself
by
constitution
,
was
already
at
the
door
,
and
setting
out
on
his
return
home
,
thinking
,
it
must
be
confessed
,
far
more
of
the
character
of
Sylvia
's
shake
of
the
hand
than
of
the
parting
words
of
either
his
uncle
or
aunt
.

STORY
OF
THE
PRESS
-
GANG
  
<EOS>
For
a
few
days
after
the
evening
mentioned
in
the
last
chapter
the
weather
was
dull
.
<EOS>
Not
in
quick
,
sudden
showers
did
the
rain
come
down
,
but
in
constant
drizzle
,
blotting
out
all
colour
from
the
surrounding
landscape
,
and
filling
the
air
with
fine
gray
mist
,
until
people
breathed
more
water
than
air
.
<EOS>
At
such
times
the
consciousness
of
the
nearness
of
the
vast
unseen
sea
acted
as
a
dreary
depression
to
the
spirits
;
but
besides
acting
on
the
nerves
of
the
excitable
,
such
weather
affected
the
sensitive
or
ailing
in
material
ways
.
<EOS>
Daniel
Robson
's
fit
of
rheumatism
incapacitated
him
from
stirring
abroad
;
and
to
a
man
of
his
active
habits
,
and
somewhat
inactive
mind
,
this
was
a
great
hardship
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
ill
-
tempered
naturally
,
but
this
state
of
confinement
made
him
more
ill
-
tempered
than
he
had
ever
been
before
in
his
life
.
<EOS>
He
sat
in
the
chimney
-
corner
,
abusing
the
weather
and
doubting
the
wisdom
or
desirableness
of
all
his
wife
saw
fit
to
do
in
the
usual
daily
household
matters
.
<EOS>
The
"
chimney
-
corner
"
was
really
a
corner
at
Haytersbank
.
<EOS>
There
were
two
projecting
walls
on
each
side
of
the
fire
-
place
,
running
about
six
feet
into
the
room
,
and
a
stout
wooden
settle
was
placed
against
one
of
these
,
while
opposite
was
the
circular
-
backed
"
master
's
chair
,
"
the
seat
of
which
was
composed
of
a
square
piece
of
wood
judiciously
hollowed
out
,
and
placed
with
one
corner
to
the
front
.
<EOS>
Here
,
in
full
view
of
all
the
operations
going
on
over
the
fire
,
sat
Daniel
Robson
for
four
live
-
long
days
,
advising
and
directing
his
wife
in
all
such
minor
matters
as
the
boiling
of
potatoes
,
the
making
of
porridge
,
all
the
work
on
which
she
specially
piqued
herself
,
and
on
which
she
would
have
taken
advice
 
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
not
from
the
most
skilled
housewife
in
all
the
three
Ridings
.
<EOS>
But
,
somehow
,
she
managed
to
keep
her
tongue
quiet
from
telling
him
,
as
she
would
have
done
any
woman
,
and
any
other
man
,
to
mind
his
own
business
,
or
she
would
pin
a
dish
-
clout
to
his
tail
.
<EOS>
She
even
checked
Sylvia
when
the
latter
proposed
,
as
much
for
fun
as
for
anything
else
,
that
his
ignorant
directions
should
be
followed
,
and
the
consequences
brought
before
his
eyes
and
his
nose
.
  
<EOS>
"
Na
,
na
!
<EOS>
"
said
Bell
,
"
th
'
feyther
's
feyther
,
and
<EOS>
we
mun
respect
him
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
dree
work
<EOS>
havin'
a
man
<EOS>
i
'
th
'
house
,
nursing
th
'
fire
,
an
'
such
weather
too
,
and
not
a
soul
coming
near
us
,
not
even
to
fall
out
wi
'
him
;
for
thee
and
me
must
na
'
do
that
,
for
th
'
Bible
's
sake
,
dear
;
and
a
good
stand
-
up
wordy
quarrel
would
do
him
a
power
of
good
;
stir
his
blood
like
.
<EOS>
I
wish
Philip
would
turn
up
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bell
sighed
,
for
in
these
four
days
she
had
experienced
somewhat
of
Madame
de
Maintenon
's
difficulty
(
and
with
fewer
resources
to
meet
it
)
of
trying
to
amuse
a
man
who
was
not
amusable
.
<EOS>
For
Bell
,
good
and
sensible
as
she
was
,
was
not
a
woman
of
resources
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
's
plan
,
undutiful
as
it
was
in
her
mother
's
eyes
,
would
have
done
Daniel
more
good
,
even
though
it
might
have
made
him
angry
,
than
his
wife
's
quiet
,
careful
monotony
of
action
,
which
,
however
it
might
conduce
to
her
husband
's
comfort
when
he
was
absent
,
did
not
amuse
him
when
present
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
scouted
the
notion
of
cousin
Philip
coming
into
their
household
in
the
character
of
an
amusing
or
entertaining
person
,
till
she
nearly
made
her
mother
angry
at
her
ridicule
of
the
good
steady
young
fellow
,
to
whom
Bell
looked
up
as
the
pattern
of
all
that
early
manhood
should
be
.
<EOS>
But
the
moment
Sylvia
saw
she
had
been
giving
her
mother
pain
,
she
left
off
her
wilful
little
jokes
,
and
kissed
her
,
and
told
her
she
would
manage
all
famously
,
and
ran
out
of
the
back
-
kitchen
,
in
which
mother
and
daughter
had
been
scrubbing
the
churn
and
all
the
wooden
implements
of
butter
-
making
.
<EOS>
Bell
looked
at
the
pretty
figure
of
her
little
daughter
,
as
,
running
past
with
her
apron
thrown
over
her
head
<EOS>
,
she
darkened
the
window
beneath
which
her
mother
was
doing
her
work
.
<EOS>
She
paused
just
for
a
moment
,
and
then
said
,
almost
unawares
to
herself
,
"
Bless
thee
,
lass
,
"
before
resuming
her
scouring
of
what
already
looked
almost
snow
-
white
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
scampered
across
the
rough
farmyard
in
the
wetting
,
drizzling
rain
to
the
place
where
she
expected
to
find
Kester
;
but
he
was
not
there
,
so
she
had
to
retrace
her
steps
to
the
cow
-
house
,
and
,
making
her
way
up
a
rough
kind
of
ladder
-
staircase
fixed
straight
against
the
wall
,
she
surprised
Kester
as
he
sat
in
the
wool
-
loft
,
looking
over
the
fleeces
reserved
for
the
home
-
spinning
,
by
popping
her
bright
face
,
swathed
round
with
her
blue
woollen
apron
,
up
through
the
trap
-
door
,
and
thus
,
her
head
the
only
visible
part
,
she
addressed
the
farm
-
servant
,
who
was
almost
like
one
of
the
family
.
  
<EOS>
"
Kester
,
feyther
's
just
tiring
hissel
'
wi
'
weariness
an
'
vexation
,
sitting
by
t
'
fireside
wi
'
<EOS>
his
hands
afore
him
,
an
'
nought
to
do
.
<EOS>
An
'
mother
and
me
ca
n't
think
on
aught
as
'll
rouse
him
up
to
a
bit
of
a
laugh
,
or
aught
more
cheerful
than
a
scolding
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Kester
,
thou
mun
just
be
off
,
and
find
Harry
Donkin
th
'
tailor
,
and
bring
him
here
;
it
's
gettin
'
on
for
Martinmas
,
an
'
he
'll
be
coming
his
rounds
,
and
he
may
as
well
come
here
first
as
last
,
and
feyther
's
clothes
want
a
deal
o
'
mending
up
,
and
Harry
's
always
full
of
his
news
,
and
anyhow
he
'll
do
for
feyther
to
scold
,
an
'
be
a
new
person
too
,
and
that
's
somewhat
for
all
on
us
.
<EOS>
Now
go
,
like
a
good
old
Kester
as
yo
'
are
.
"
  
<EOS>
Kester
looked
at
her
with
loving
,
faithful
admiration
.
<EOS>
He
had
set
himself
his
day
's
work
in
his
master
's
absence
,
and
was
very
desirous
of
finishing
it
,
but
,
somehow
,
he
never
dreamed
of
resisting
Sylvia
,
so
he
only
stated
the
case
.
  
<EOS>
"
T
'
'
ool
's
a
vast
o
'
muck
in

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
good
old
Kester
,
"
said
she
,
smiling
,
and
nodding
her
muffled
head
at
him
;
then
she
dipped
down
out
of
his
sight
,
then
rose
up
again
<EOS>
(
he
had
never
taken
his
slow
,
mooney
eyes
from
the
spot
where
she
had
disappeared
)
to
say
 
"
Now
,
Kester
,
be
wary
and
deep
 
thou
mun
tell
Harry
Donkin
not
to
let
on
as
we
've
sent
for
him
,
but
just
to
come
in
as
if
he
were
on
his
round
,
and
took
us
first
;
and
he
mun
ask
feyther
if
there
is
any
work
for
him
to
do
;
and
I
'll
answer
for
'
t
,
he
'll
have
a
welcome
and
a
half
.
<EOS>
Now

"
  
<EOS>
"
A'se
deep
an
'
fause
enow
wi

simple
folk

but
what

a
do

and
I'se

"
  
<EOS>
Kester
laughed
so
long
at
the
idea
of
his
being
the
Queen
of
Sheba
,
that
Sylvia
was
back
by
her
mother
's
side
before
the
cachinnation
ended
.
  
<EOS>
That
night
,
just
as
Sylvia
was
preparing
to
go
to
bed
in
her
little
closet
of
a
room
,
she
heard
some
shot
rattling
at
her
window
.
<EOS>
She
opened
the
little
casement
,
and
saw
Kester
standing
below
.
<EOS>
He
recommenced
where
he
left
off
,
with
a
laugh
    
"
He
,
he
,

<EOS>
A

<EOS>
A'se

"
  
<EOS>
The
honest
fellow
never
said
a
word
of
the
shilling
he
had
paid
out
of
his
own
pocket
to
forward
Sylvia
's
wishes
,
and
to
persuade
the
tailor
to
leave
the
good
beer
.
<EOS>
All
his
anxiety
now
was
to
know
if
he
had
been
missed
,
and
if
it
was
likely
that
a
scolding
awaited
him
in
the
morning
.

The
next
morning
,
Sylvia
's
face
was
a
little
redder
than
usual
when
Harry
Donkin
's
bow
-
legs
were
seen
circling
down
the
path
to
the
house
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here

Donkin
,

"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Bell
,
when
she
caught
sight
of
him
a
minute
after
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well

I
just

This
was
too
original
a
remark
for
a
wife
to
make
in
Daniel
's
opinion
,
on
this
especial
morning
,
when
his
rheumatism
was
twinging
him
more
than
usual
,
so
he
replied
with
severity

"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
'd
better
tell
Donkin
as
we
've
no
work
for
him
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
instinctively
managing
her
father
by
agreeing
with
him
,
instead
of
reasoning
with
or
contradicting
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
theere
you
go
!
"
<EOS>
wrenching
himself
round
,
for
fear
Sylvia
should
carry
her
meekly
made
threat
into
execution
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ugh
!
ugh
!
"
<EOS>
as
his
limb
hurt
him
.
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
Harry
,
come
in
,
and
talk
a
bit
o

sense
to
me
,
for
a've
been
shut
up
wi

women
these
four
days

and
a'm
a'most

by

A'se

if

t

nought

for
to
save
their

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
Harry
took
off
his
coat
,
and
seated
himself
professional
-
wise
on
the
hastily
-
cleared
dresser
,
so
that
he
might
have
all
the
light
afforded
by
the
long
,
low
casement
window
.
<EOS>
Then
he
blew
in
his
thimble
,
sucked
his
finger
,
so
that
they
might
adhere
tightly
together
,
and
looked
about
for
a
subject
for
opening
conversation
,
while
Sylvia
and
her
mother
might
be
heard
opening
and
shutting
drawers
and
box
-
lids
before
they
could
find
the
articles
that
needed
repair
,
or
that
were
required
to
mend
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
Women

their

"
said
Daniel
,
in
a
philosophizing
tone
,
"
but
a

have
too
much

<EOS>
Now
there

Now

"
<EOS>
as
Bell
came
down
with
her
arms
full
.
<EOS>
She
was
going
to
answer
her
husband
meekly
and
literally
according
to
her
wo
nt
,
but
Sylvia
,
already
detecting
the
increased
cheerfulness
of
his
tone
,
called
out
from
behind
her
mother
    
<EOS>
"
I
am

<EOS>
I
'm
going

Hearken

Daniel

chuckling

She

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
reckon
<EOS>
it
's
a
bargain

"
said
Harry
,
casting
sharp
,
professional
eyes
on
the
heap
before
him
,
and
singling
out
the
best
article
as
to
texture
for
examination
and
comment
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
're
all
again

"
said
he
.
"
<EOS>
Silk

"
  
<EOS>
By
this
time
Harry
had
arranged
a
certain
course
of
action
with
Mrs
Robson
,
conducting
the
consultation
and
agreement
by
signs
.
<EOS>
His
thread
was
flying
fast
already
,
and
the
mother
and
daughter
felt
more
free
to
pursue
their
own
business
than
they
had
done
for
several
days
;
for
it
was
a
good
sign
that
Daniel
had
taken
his
pipe
out
of
the
square
hollow
in
the
fireside
wall
,
where
he
usually
kept
it
,
and
was
preparing
to
diversify
his
remarks
with
satisfying
interludes
of
puffing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
look
ye
;
this
very
baccy
had
a
run
for
'
t.
<EOS>
It
came
ashore
sewed
up
neatly
enough
<EOS>
i
'
a
woman
's
stays
,
as
was
wife
to
a
fishing
-
smack
down
at
t
'
bay
yonder
.
<EOS>
She
were
a
lean
thing
as
iver
you
saw
,
when
she
went
for
t
'
see
her
husband
aboard
t
'
vessel
;
but
she
coom
back
lustier
by
a
deal
,
an
'
wi
'
many
a
thing
on
her
,
here
and
theere

beside

<EOS>
An

that

'
t

face
o

coast

guard
and
yon
tender
,
an
'
a
'
.
<EOS>
But
she
made
as
though
she
were
tipsy
,
an
'
<EOS>
so
they
did
nought
but
curse
her
,
an
'
get
out
on
her
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Speaking
of
t
'
tender
,
there
's
been
<EOS>
a
piece
o
'
<EOS>
wark
<EOS>
i
'
Monkshaven
this
week
wi
'
t
'
press
-
gang
,
"
said
Harry
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
<EOS>
ay
!
<EOS>
our
lass
was
telling
about

t
;
but
,
Lord
bless
ye
!
<EOS>
there
's
no
gettin

rights
on

out
on
a

though
a
will
say
this
for

she
's
as
bright
a
lass
as
iver
a
man
looked
at

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Now
the
truth
was
,
that
Daniel
had
not
liked
to
demean
himself
,
at
the
time
when
Sylvia
came
back
so
full
of
what
she
had
seen
at
Monkshaven
,
by
evincing
any
curiosity
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
He
had
then
thought
that
the
next
day
he
would
find
some
business
that
should
take
him
down
to
the
town
,
when
he
could
learn
all
that
was
to
be
learnt
,
without
flattering
his
womankind
by
asking
questions
,
as
if
anything
they
might
say
could
interest
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
strong
notion
of
being
a
kind
of
domestic
Jupiter
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
made
<EOS>
a
deal
o
'
<EOS>
wark
<EOS>
i
'
Monkshaven
.
<EOS>
Folk
had
gotten
to
think
nought
o
'
t
'
tender
<EOS>
,
she
lay
so
still
,
an
'
t
'
leftenant
paid
such
a
good
price
for
all
he
wanted
for
t
'
ship
.
<EOS>
But
o
'
Thursday
t
'
_
Resolution
_
,
first
whaler
back
this
season
,
came
in
port
,
and
t
'
press
-
gang
showed
their
teeth
,
and
carried
off
four
as
good
able
-
bodied
seamen
as
iver
<EOS>
I
made
trousers
for
;
and
t
'
place
were
all
up
like
a
nest
o
'
wasps
,
when
yo've
set
your
foot
in
t
'
midst
.
<EOS>
They
were
so
mad
,
they
were
ready
for
t
'
fight
t
'
very
pavin
'
stones
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A

a'd

<EOS>
A

A've
a
score

up
wi

t

press

gang

"
  
<EOS>
And
the
old
man
lifted
up
his
right
hand
 
his
hand
on
which
the
forefinger
and
thumb
were
maimed
and
useless
 
partly
in
denunciation
,
and
partly
as
a
witness
of
what
he
had
endured
to
escape
from
the
service
,
abhorred
because
it
was
forced
.
<EOS>
His
face
became
a
totally
different
countenance
with
the
expression
of
settled
and
unrelenting
indignation
,
which
his
words
called
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
G'on
,
man
,
g'on
,
"
said
Daniel
,
impatient
with
Donkin
for
the
little
delay
occasioned
by
the
necessity
of
arranging
his
work
more
fully
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay

"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
took
her
directions
,
and
placed
her
irons
in
the
fire
,
and
ran
upstairs
for
the
bundle
which
had
been
put
aside
by
her
careful
mother
for
occasions
like
the
present
.
<EOS>
It
consisted
of
small
pieces
of
various
coloured
cloth
,
cut
out
of
old
coats
and
waistcoats
,
and
similar
garments
,
when
the
whole
had
become
too
much
worn
for
use
,
yet
when
part
had
been
good
enough
to
be
treasured
by
a
thrifty
housewife
.
<EOS>
Daniel
grew
angry
before
Donkin
had
selected
his
patterns
and
settled
the
work
to
his
own
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well

"
said
he
at
last
;
"
a

Then
,
as
a
were
saying
,
all
Monkshaven
were
like
a
nest
o

wasps
,
flyin
'
hither
and

makin

just

went

nother

barred

Niver

He

he
were

but
his

coome

went

as

an

how

fired
at

and
how
t

innocent

hoisted
her

but
afore
they
were
fairly
run
up
,
another
shot
coome
close
in

,
and
then
t
'
Greenland
ship
being
t

,
bore
down
on

but
as
they
knew
she
were
an

and
bent
on
mischief
,
Kinraid

and

just

to

,
as

'
  
"
Damn
'
em
!
"
said
Daniel
,
in
soliloquy
,
and
under
his
breath
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
stood
,
poising
her
iron
,
and
listening
eagerly
,
afraid
to
give
Donkin
the
hot
iron
for
fear
of
interrupting
the
narrative
,
unwilling
to
put
it
into
the
fire
again
,
because
that
action
would
perchance
remind
him
of
his
work
,
which
now
the
tailor
had
forgotten
,
<EOS>
so
eager
was
he
in
telling
his
story
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
they
coome
on
over
t
'
watters
wi
'
great
bounds
,
and
<EOS>
up
t
'
sides
they
coome
like
locusts
,
all
armed
men
;
an
'
t
'
captain
says
he
saw
Kinraid
hide
away
his
whaling
knife
under
some
tarpaulin
'
,
and
he
knew
he
meant
mischief
,
an
'
he
would
no
more
ha
'
stopped
him
wi
'
a
word
nor
he
would
ha
'
stopped
him
<EOS>
fra
'
killing
a
whale
.
<EOS>
And
when
t
'
_
Aurora
_
's
men
were
aboard
,
one
on
'em
runs
to
t
'
helm
;
and
at
that
t
'
captain
says
,
he
felt
as
if
his
wife
were
kissed
afore
his
face
;
but
says
he
,
"
I
bethought
me
on
t
'
men
as
were
shut
up
below
hatches
,
an
'
I
remembered
t
'
folk
at
Monkshaven
as
were
looking
out
for
us
even
then
;
an
'
I
said
to
mysel
'
,
I
would
speak
fair
as
long
as
I
could
,
more
by
token
o
'
the
whaling
-
knife
,
as
I
could
see
glinting
bright
under
t
'
black
tarpaulin
.
"
<EOS>
So
he
spoke
quite
fair
and
civil
,
though
he
see'd
they
was
nearing
t
'
_
Aurora
_
,
and
t
'
<EOS>
_
Aurora
_
was
nearing
them
.
<EOS>
Then
t
'
navy
captain
hailed
him
thro
'
t
'
trumpet
,
wi
'
a
great
rough
blast
,
and
,
says
he
,
"
Order
your
men
to
come
on
deck
.
"
<EOS>
And
t
'
captain
of
t
'
whaler
says
his
men
cried
up
from
under
t
'
hatches
as
they
'd
niver
be
gi'en
up
wi'out
bloodshed
,
and
<EOS>
he
sees
Kinraid
take
out
his
pistol
,
and
look
well
to
t
'
priming
;
so
he
says
to
t
'
navy
captain
,
"
We
're
protected
Greenland
-
men
,
and
you
have
no
right
t
'
meddle
wi
'
us
.
"
<EOS>
But
t
'
navy
captain
only
bellows
t
'
more
,
"
Order
<EOS>
your
men
t
'
come
on
deck
.
<EOS>
If
they
wo
n't
obey
you
,
and
you
have
lost
the
command
of
your
vessel
<EOS>
,
I
reckon
you
're
in
a
state
of
mutiny
,
and
you
may
come
aboard
t
'
_
Aurora
_
and
such
men
as
are
willing
t
'
follow
you
,
and
I
'll
fire
int
'
the
rest
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yo
'
see
,
that
were
t
<EOS>
'
depth
o
'
<EOS>
the
man
:
he
were
for
pretending
and
pretexting
as
t
'
captain
could
na
manage
his
own
ship
,
and
as
he
'd
help
him
.
<EOS>
But
our
Greenland
captain
were
noane
so
poor
-
spirited
,
and
says
he
,
"
She
's
full
of
oil
,
and
I
ware
you
of
consequences
if
you
fire
into
her
.
<EOS>
Anyhow
,
pirate
,
or
no
pirate
"
(
for
t
'
word
pirate
stuck
in
his
gizzard
)
,
"
I
'm
a
honest
Monkshaven
man
,
an
'
I
come
fra
'
a
land
where
there
's
great
icebergs
and
many
a
deadly
danger
,
but
niver
a
press
-
gang
,
thank
God
!
<EOS>
and
that
's
what
you
are
,
I
reckon
.
<EOS>
"
Them
's
the
words
he
told
me
,
but
whether
he
spoke
'em
out
so
bold
at
t
'
time
,
I'se
not
so
sure
;
they
were
in
his
mind
for
t
'
speak
,
only
maybe
prudence
got
t
'
better
on
him
,
for
he
said
he
prayed
i
'
<EOS>
his
heart
to
bring
his
cargo
safe
to
t
'
owners
,
come
what
might
.
<EOS>
Well
,
t
'
_
Aurora
_
's
men
aboard
t
'
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Good
Fortune
_
cried
out
"
might
they
fire
down
t
'
hatches
,
and
bring
t
'
men
out
that
a
way
?
"
<EOS>
and
then
t
'
specksioneer
,
he
speaks
,
an
'
he
says
he
stands
ower
t
'
hatches
,
and
he
has
two
good
pistols
,
and
summut
besides
,
and
he
do
n't
care
for
his
life
,
bein
'
a
bachelor
,
but
all
below
are
married
men
<EOS>
,
yo
'
see
,
and
he
'll
put
an
end
to
t
'
first
two
chaps
as
come
near
t
'
hatches
.
<EOS>
An
'
they
say
he
picked
two
off
as
made
for
t
'
<EOS>
come
near
,
and
<EOS>
then
,
just
as
he
were
stooping
for
t
'
whaling
knife
,
an
'
it
's
as
big
as
a
sickle
   
<EOS>
'
  
"
Teach
folk
as
do
n't

"
cried
Daniel
.
<EOS>
"
I
were
a
Greenland
-
man
mysel
'
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
shot
him
through
t
'
side
,
and
dizzied
him
,
and
kicked
him
aside
for
dead
;
and
fired
down
t
'
hatches
,
and
killed
one
man
,
and
disabled
two
,
and
then
t
'
rest
cried
for
quarter
,
for
life
is
sweet
,
e'en
aboard
a
king
's
ship
;
and
t
'
_
Aurora
_
carried
'em
off
,
wounded
men
,
an
'
able
men
,
an
'
all
:
leaving
Kinraid
for
dead
,
as
was
n't
dead
,
and
Darley
for
dead
,
as
was
dead
,
an
'
t
'
captain
and
master
's
mate
as
were
too
old
for
work
;
and
t
'
captain
,
as
loves
Kinraid
like
a
brother
,
poured
rum
down
his
throat
,
and
bandaged
him
up
,
and
has
sent
for
t
'
first
doctor
in
Monkshaven
for
to
get
t
'
slugs
out
;
for
they
say
there
's
niver
<EOS>
such
a
harpooner
in
a
'
t
'
Greenland
seas
;
an
'
I
can
speak
fra
'
my
own
seeing
he
's
a
fine
young
fellow
where
he
lies
theere
,
<EOS>
all
stark
and
wan
for
weakness
and
loss
o
'
blood
.
<EOS>
But
Darley
's
dead
as
a
door
-
nail
;
and
there
's
to
be
such
a
burying
of
him
as
niver
was
seen
<EOS>
afore
i
'
Monkshaven
,
come
Sunday
.
<EOS>
And
now
gi
'
us
t
'
iron
,
wench
,
and
let
's
lose
no
more
time
a
-
talking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
noane
loss
o
'
time
,
"
said
Daniel
,
moving
himself
heavily
in
his
chair
,
to
feel
how
helpless
he
was
once
more
.
<EOS>
"
If
a
were
as
young
as
once
a
were
 
nay
,
lad
,
if
a
had
na
these
sore
rheumatics
,
now
 
a
reckon
as
t
'
press
-
gang
'
<EOS>
ud
find
out
as
t
'
should
n't
do
such
things
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
Bless
thee
,
man
!
<EOS>
it
's
waur
<EOS>
nor
i
'
my
youth
<EOS>
i
'
th
'
Ameriky
war
,
<EOS>
and
then
'
t
were
bad
enough
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
Kinraid
?
"
said
Sylvia
,
drawing
a
long
breath
,
after
the
effort
of
realizing
it
all
;
her
cheeks
had
flushed
up
,
and
her
eyes
had
glittered
during
the
progress
of
the
tale
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
he
'll
do
.
<EOS>
He
'll
not
die
.
<EOS>
Life
's
stuff
is
in
him
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
'll
be
Molly
Corney
's
cousin
,
I
reckon
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
bethinking
her
with
a
blush
of
Molly
Corney
's
implication
that
he
was
more
than
a
cousin
to
her
,
and
immediately
longing
to
go
off
and
see
Molly
,
and
hear
all
the
little
details
which
women
do
not
think
it
beneath
them
to
give
to
women
.
<EOS>
From
that
time
Sylvia
's
little
heart
was
bent
on
this
purpose
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
one
to
be
openly
avowed
even
to
herself
.
<EOS>
She
only
wanted
sadly
to
see
Molly
,
and
she
almost
believed
herself
that
it
was
to
consult
her
about
the
fashion
of
her
cloak
;
which
Donkin
was
to
cut
out
,
and
which
she
was
to
make
under
his
directions
;
at
any
rate
,
this
was
the
reason
she
gave
to
her
mother
when
the
day
's
work
was
done
,
and
a
fine
gleam
came
out
upon
the
pale
and
watery
sky
towards
evening
.
    
<EOS>
THE
SAILOR
'S
<EOS>
FUNERAL
  
<EOS>
Moss
Brow
,
the
Corney
's
house
,
was
but
a
disorderly
,
comfortless
place
.
<EOS>
You
had
to
cross
a
dirty
farmyard
,
all
puddles
and
dungheaps
,
on
stepping
-
stones
,
to
get
to
the
door
of
the
house
-
place
.
<EOS>
That
great
room
itself
was
sure
to
have
clothes
hanging
to
dry
at
the
fire
,
whatever
day
of
the
week
it
was
;
some
one
of
the
large
irregular
family
having
had
what
is
called
in
the
district
a
"
dab
-
wash
"
of
a
few
articles
,
forgotten
on
the
regular
day
.
<EOS>
And
sometimes
these
articles
lay
in
their
dirty
state
in
the
untidy
kitchen
,
out
of
which
a
room
,
half
parlour
,
half
bedroom
,
opened
on
one
side
,
and
a
dairy
,
the
only
clean
place
in
the
house
,
at
the
opposite
.
<EOS>
In
face
of
you
,
as
you
entered
the
door
,
was
the
entrance
to
the
working
-
kitchen
,
or
scullery
.
<EOS>
Still
,
in
spite
of
disorder
like
this
,
there
was
a
well
-
to
-
do
aspect
about
the
place
;
the
Corneys
were
rich
in
their
way
,
in
flocks
and
herds
as
well
as
in
children
;
and
to
them
neither
dirt
nor
the
perpetual
bustle
arising
from
ill
-
ordered
work
detracted
from
comfort
.
<EOS>
They
were
all
of
an
easy
,
good
-
tempered
nature
;
Mrs.
Corney
and
her
daughters
gave
every
one
a
welcome
at
whatever
time
of
the
day
they
came
,
and
would
just
as
soon
sit
down
for
a
gossip
at
ten
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
as
at
five
in
the
evening
,
though
at
the
former
time
the
house
-
place
was
full
of
work
of
various
kinds
which
ought
to
be
got
out
of
hand
and
done
with
:
while
the
latter
hour
was
towards
the
end
of
the
day
,
when
farmers
'
wives
and
daughters
were
usually
 
"
cleaned
"
<EOS>
was
the
word
then
,
<EOS>
"
dressed
"
is
that
in
vogue
now
.
<EOS>
Of
course
in
such
a
household
as
this
Sylvia
was
sure
to
be
gladly
received
.
<EOS>
She
was
young
,
and
pretty
,
and
bright
,
and
brought
a
fresh
breeze
of
pleasant
air
about
her
as
her
appropriate
atmosphere
.
<EOS>
And
besides
,
Bell
Robson
held
her
head
so
high
that
visits
from
her
daughter
were
rather
esteemed
as
a
favour
,
for
it
was
not
everywhere
that
Sylvia
was
allowed
to
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sit
yo
'
<EOS>
down
,
sit
yo
'
down
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Dame
Corney
,
dusting
a
chair
with
her
apron
;
"
a
reckon
Molly
'll
be
in
i
'
no
time
.
<EOS>
She
's
nobbut
<EOS>
gone
int
'
t
'
orchard
,
to
see
if
she
can
find
wind
-
falls
enough
for
t
'
make
a
pie
or
two
for
t
'
lads
.
<EOS>
They
like
nowt
<EOS>
so
weel
for
supper
as
apple
-
pies
sweetened
wi
'
treacle
,
crust
stout
and
leathery
,
as

chewing
,
and
we
hannot

apples
yet

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
Molly
is
in
t
'
orchard
,
I
'll
go
find
her
,
"
said
Sylvia
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
!
yo
'
lasses
will
have
your
conks
"
(
private
talks
)
,
"
a
know
;
secrets
'bout
sweethearts
and
such
like
,
"
said
Mrs.
Corney
,
with
a
knowing
look
,
which
made
Sylvia
hate
her
for
the
moment
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A've
not
forgotten
as
a
were
young
mysen
.
<EOS>
Tak

care
;
there
's
a
pool
o
'
<EOS>
mucky
watter
just
outside
t
'
back
-
door
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
Sylvia
was
half
-
way
across
the
back
-
yard
 
<EOS>
worse
,
if
possible
,
than
the
front
as
to
the
condition
in
which
it
was
kept
 
and
had
passed
through
the
little
gate
into
the
orchard
.
<EOS>
It
was
full
of
old
gnarled
apple
-
trees
,
their
trunks
covered
with
gray
lichen
,
in
which
the
cunning
chaffinch
built
her
nest
in
spring
-
time
.
<EOS>
The
cankered
branches
remained
on
the
trees
,
and
added
to
the
knotted
interweaving
overhead
,
if
they
did
not
to
the
productiveness
;
the
grass
grew
in
long
tufts
,
and
was
wet
and
tangled
under
foot
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
tolerable
crop
of
rosy
apples
still
hanging
on
the
gray
old
trees
,
and
here
and
there
they
showed
ruddy
in
the
green
bosses
of
untrimmed
grass
.
<EOS>
Why
the
fruit
was
not
gathered
,
as
it
was
evidently
ripe
,
would
have
puzzled
any
one
not
acquainted
with
the
Corney
family
to
say
;
but
to
them
it
was
always
a
maxim
in
practice
,
if
not
in
precept
,
"
Do
nothing
to
-
day
that
you
can
put
off
till
to
-
morrow
,
"
and
accordingly
the
apples
dropped
from
the
trees
at
any
little
gust
of
wind
,
and
lay
rotting
on
the
ground
until
the
"
lads
"
wanted
a
supply
of
pies
for
supper
.
  
<EOS>
Molly
saw
Sylvia
,
and
came
quickly
across
the
orchard
to
meet
her
,
catching
her
feet
in
knots
of
grass
as
she
hurried
along
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
lass
!
<EOS>
"
said
she
,
"
who
'd
ha
'
thought
o
'
seeing
yo
'
such
a
day
as
it
has
been
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
's
cleared
up
now
beautiful
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
looking
up
at
the
soft
evening
sky
,
to
be
seen
through
the
apple
boughs
.
<EOS>
It
was
of
a
tender
,
delicate
gray
,
with
the
faint
warmth
of
a
promising
sunset
tinging
it
with
a
pink
atmosphere
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Rain
is
over
and
gone
,
and
I
wanted
to
know
how
my
cloak
is
to
be
made
;
for
Donkin
's
working
at
our
house
,
and
I
wanted
to
know
all
about
 
the
news
,
yo
'
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
news
?
"
asked
Molly
,
for
she
had
heard
of
the
affair
between
the
_
Good
Fortune
_
and
the
_
Aurora
_
some
days
before
;
and
,
to
tell
the
truth
<EOS>
,
it
had
rather
passed
out
of
her
head
just
at
this
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hannot
yo
'
heard
all
about
t
'
press
-
gang
and
t
'
whaler
,
and
t
'
great
fight
,
and
Kinraid
,
as
is
your
cousin
,
acting
so
brave
and
grand
,
and
lying
on
his
death
-
bed
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
"
said
Molly
,
enlightened
as
to
Sylvia
's
"
news
,
"
and
half
surprised
at
the
vehemence
with
which
the
little
creature
spoke
;
"
yes
;
a
heerd
that
days
ago
.
<EOS>
But
Charley
's
noane
on
his
death
-
bed
,
he
's
a
deal
better
;
an
'
mother
says
as
he
's
to
be
moved
up
here
next
week
for
nursin
'
and
better
air
<EOS>
nor
he
gets
i
'
t
'
town
yonder
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
!
I
am
so
glad
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
with
all
her
heart
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
he
'd
maybe
die
,
and
I
should
niver
see
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A'll
promise
yo
'
shall
see
him
;
that
's
t
'
say
if
a
'
goes
on
well
,
for
he
's
getten
an
ugly
hurt
.
<EOS>
Mother
says
as
there
's
four
blue
marks
on
his
side
as'll
last
him
<EOS>
his
life
<EOS>
,
an
'
t
'
doctor
fears
bleeding
i
'
his
inside
;
and
then
he
'll
drop
down
dead
when
no
one
looks
for
'
t.
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
you
said
he
was
better
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
blanching
a
little
at
this
account
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
he
's
better
,
but
life
's
uncertain
,
special
after
gun
-
shot
wounds
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
acted
very
fine
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
meditating
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
allays
knowed
he
would
.
<EOS>
Many
's
the
time
a've
heerd
him
say
"
<EOS>
honour
bright
,
"
and
now
he
's
shown
how
bright
his
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
Molly
did
not
speak
sentimentally
,
but
with
a
kind
of
proprietorship
in
Kinraid
's
honour
,
which
confirmed
Sylvia
in
her
previous
idea
of
a
mutual
attachment
between
her
and
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
Considering
this
notion
,
she
was
a
little
surprised
at
Molly
's
next
speech
.
  
<EOS>
"
An
'
about
yer
cloak
,
are
you
for
a
hood
or
a
cape
?
<EOS>
a
reckon
that
's
the
question
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
do
n't
care
!
<EOS>
tell
me
more
about
Kinraid
.
<EOS>
Do
yo
'
really
think
he
'll
get
better
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
!
<EOS>
how
t
'
lass
takes
on
about
him
.
<EOS>
A'll
tell
him
what
a
deal
of
interest
a
young
woman
taks
i
'
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
From
that
time
Sylvia
never
asked
another
question
about
him
.
<EOS>
In
a
somewhat
dry
and
altered
tone
,
she
said
,
after
a
little
pause
    
<EOS>
"
I
think
on
a
hood
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
say
to
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
hoods
is
a
bit
old
-
fashioned
,
to
my
mind
.
<EOS>
If
'
t
were
mine
,
I
'd
have
a
cape
cut
<EOS>
i
'
three
points
,
one
to
tie
on
each
shoulder
,
and
one
to
dip
down
handsome
behind
.
<EOS>
But
let
yo
'
an
'
me
go
to
Monkshaven
church
o
'
Sunday
,
and
see
Measter
Fishburn
's
daughters
,
as
has
their
things
made
i
'
York
,
and
notice
a
bit
how
they
're
made
.
<EOS>
We
need
n't
do
it
<EOS>
i
'
church
,
but
<EOS>
just
scan
<EOS>
'em
<EOS>
o'er
<EOS>
i
<EOS>
'
t
'
churchyard
,
and
there
'll
be
no
harm
done
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
there
's
to
be
this
grand
burryin
'
o
'
t
'
man
t
'
press
-
gang
shot
,
and
'
t
will
be
like
killing
two
birds
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
go
,
"
said
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
"
I
feel
so
sorry
like
for
the
poor
sailors
shot
down
and
kidnapped
just
as
they
was
coming
home
,
as
we
see'd
'em
o
'
Thursday
last
.
<EOS>
I
'll
ask
mother
if
she
'll
let
me
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
do
.
<EOS>
I
know
my
mother
'll
let
me
,
if
she
does
n't
go
hersen
;
for
it
'll
be
a
sight
to
see
and
to
speak
on
for
many
a
long
year
,
after
what
I
've
heerd
.
<EOS>
And
Miss
Fishburns
is
sure
to
be
theere
,
so
I
'd
just
get
Donkin
to
cut
out
cloak
itsel
'
,
and
keep
back
yer
mind
fra
'
fixing
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
either
cape
or
hood
till
Sunday
's
turn'd
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Will
yo
'
set
me
part
o
'
t
'
way
home
?
"
said
Sylvia
,
seeing
the
dying
daylight
become
more
and
more
crimson
through
the
blackening
trees
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
ca
n't
.
<EOS>
A
should
like
it
well
enough
,
but
somehow
,
there
's
a
deal
o
'
work
to
be
done
yet
,
for
t
'
hours
slip
through
one
's
fingers
so
as
there
's
no
knowing
.
<EOS>
Mind
yo
'
,
then
,
o
'
Sunday
.
<EOS>
A'll
be
at
t
'
stile
one
o'clock
punctual
;
and
we
'll
go
slowly
into
t
'
town
,
and
look
about
us
as
we
go
,
and
see
folk
's
dresses
;
and
go
to
t
'
church
,
and
say
wer
prayers
,
and
come
out
and
have
a
look
at
t
'
funeral
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
with
this
programme
of
proceedings
settled
for
the
following
Sunday
,
the
girls
whom
neighbourhood
and
parity
of
age
had
forced
into
some
measure
of
friendship
parted
for
the
time
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
hastened
home
,
feeling
as
if
she
had
been
absent
long
;
her
mother
stood
on
the
little
knoll
at
the
side
of
the
house
watching
for
her
,
with
her
hand
shading
her
eyes
from
the
low
rays
of
the
setting
sun
:
<EOS>
but
as
soon
as
she
saw
her
daughter
in
the
distance
,
she
returned
to
her
work
,
whatever
that
might
be
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
a
woman
of
many
words
,
or
of
much
demonstration
;
few
observers
would
have
guessed
how
much
she
loved
her
child
;
but
Sylvia
,
without
any
reasoning
or
observation
,
instinctively
knew
that
her
mother
's
heart
was
bound
up
in
her
.
  
<EOS>
Her
father
and
Donkin
were
going
on
much
as
when
she
had
left
them
;
talking
and
disputing
,
the
one
compelled
to
be
idle
,
<EOS>
the
other
stitching
away
as
fast
as
he
talked
.
<EOS>
They
seemed
as
if
they
had
never
missed
Sylvia
;
no
more
did
her
mother
for
that
matter
,
for
she
was
busy
and
absorbed
in
her
afternoon
dairy
-
work
to
all
appearance
.
<EOS>
But
Sylvia
had
noted
the
watching
not
three
minutes
before
,
and
many
a
time
in
her
after
life
,
when
no
one
cared
much
for
her
out
-
goings
and
in
-
comings
,
the
straight
,
upright
figure
of
her
mother
,
fronting
the
setting
sun
,
but
searching
through
its
blinding
rays
for
a
sight
of
her
child
,
rose
up
like
a
sudden
-
seen
picture
,
the
remembrance
of
which
smote
Sylvia
to
the
heart
with
a
sense
of
a
lost
blessing
,
not
duly
valued
while
possessed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
feyther
,
and
how
's
a
'
wi
'
you
?
"
asked
Sylvia
,
going
to
the
side
of
his
chair
,
and
laying
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
!
harkee
till
this
lass
o
'
mine
.
<EOS>
She
thinks
as
because
she
's
gone
galraverging
<EOS>
,
I
maun
ha
'
missed
her
and
be
ailing
.
<EOS>
Why
,
lass
,
Donkin
and
me
has
had
t
'
most
sensible
talk
a've
had
this
many
a
day
.
<EOS>
A've
gi'en
him
a
vast
o
'
knowledge
,
and
he
's
done
me
a
power
o
'
<EOS>
good
.
<EOS>
Please
God
,
to
-
morrow
a'll
tak
'
a
start
at
walking
,
if
t
'
weather
holds
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
"
said
Donkin
,
with
a
touch
of
sarcasm
in
his
voice
;
<EOS>
"
feyther
and
me
has
settled
many
puzzles
;
it
's
been
a
loss
to
Government
as
they
hannot
been
here
for
profiting
by
our
wisdom
.
<EOS>
We
've
done
away
wi
'
taxes
and
press
-
gangs
,
and
many
a
plague
,
and
beaten
t
'
French
 
i
'
<EOS>
our
own
minds
,
that
's
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
wonder
t
'
me
as
those
Lunnon
folks
ca
n't
see
things
clear
,
"
said
Daniel
,
all
in
good
faith
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
did
not
quite
understand
the
state
of
things
as
regarded
politics
and
taxes
 
and
politics
and
taxes
were
all
one
in
her
mind
<EOS>
,
it
must
be
confessed
 
but
she
saw
that
her
innocent
little
scheme
of
giving
her
father
the
change
of
society
afforded
by
Donkin
's
coming
had
answered
;
and
in
the
gladness
of
her
heart
she
went
out
and
ran
round
the
corner
of
the
house
to
find
Kester
,
and
obtain
from
him
that
sympathy
in
her
success
which
she
dared
not
ask
from
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Kester
,
Kester
,
lad
!
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
in
a
loud
whisper
;
but
Kester
was
suppering
the
horses
,
and
in
the
clamp
of
their
feet
on
the
round
stable
pavement
,
he
did
not
hear
her
at
first
.
<EOS>
She
went
a
little
farther
into
the
stable
.
"
<EOS>
Kester
!
<EOS>
he
's
a
vast
better
,
he
'll
go
out
to
-
morrow
;
it
's
all
Donkin
's
doing
.
<EOS>
I
'm
beholden
to
thee
for
fetching
him
,
and
I
'll
try
and
spare
thee
waistcoat
fronts
out
o
'
t
'
stuff
for
my
new
red
cloak
.
<EOS>
Thou'll
like
that
,
Kester
,
wo
n't
ta
?
"
  
<EOS>
Kester
took
the
notion
in
slowly
,
and
weighed
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Na
,
lass
,
"
said
he
,
deliberately
,
after
a
pause
.
<EOS>
"
A
could
na
'
bear
to
see
thee
wi
'
thy
cloak
scrimpit
.
<EOS>
A
like
t
'
see
a
wench
look
bonny
and
smart
,
an
'
a
tak
'
<EOS>
a
kind
o
'
pride
in
thee
,
an
should
be
a'most
<EOS>
as
much
hurt
<EOS>
i
'
my
mind
to
see
thee
i
'
a
pinched
cloak
as
if
old
Moll
's
tail
here
were
docked
too
short
.
<EOS>
Na
,
lass
<EOS>
,
a'se
niver
got
a
mirroring
glass
for
t
'
see
mysen
in
,
so
<EOS>
what
's
waistcoats
to
me
?
<EOS>
Keep
thy
stuff
to
thysen
,
theere
's
a
good
wench
;
but
a'se
main
and
glad
about
t
'
measter
.
<EOS>
Place
is
n't
like
itsen
when
he
's
shut
up
and
cranky
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
took
up
a
wisp
of
straw
and
began
rubbing
down
the
old
mare
,
and
hissing
over
his
work
as
if
he
wished
to
consider
the
conversation
as
ended
.
<EOS>
And
Sylvia
,
who
had
strung
herself
up
in
a
momentary
fervour
of
gratitude
to
make
the
generous
offer
,
was
not
sorry
to
have
it
refused
,
and
went
back
planning
what
kindness
she
could
show
to
Kester
without
its
involving
so
much
sacrifice
to
herself
.
<EOS>
For
giving
waistcoat
fronts
to
him
would
deprive
her
of
the
pleasant
power
of
selecting
a
fashionable
pattern
in
Monkshaven
churchyard
next
Sunday
.
  
<EOS>
That
wished
-
for
day
seemed
long
a
-
coming
,
as
wished
-
for
days
most
frequently
do
.
<EOS>
Her
father
got
better
by
slow
degrees
,
and
her
mother
was
pleased
by
the
tailor
's
good
pieces
of
work
;
showing
the
neatly
-
placed
patches
with
as
much
pride
as
many
matrons
take
in
new
clothes
now
-
a
-
days
.
<EOS>
And
the
weather
cleared
up
into
a
dim
kind
of
autumnal
fineness
,
into
anything
but
an
Indian
summer
as
far
as
regarded
gorgeousness
of
colouring
,
for
on
that
coast
the
mists
and
sea
fogs
early
spoil
the
brilliancy
of
the
foliage
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
perhaps
,
the
more
did
the
silvery
grays
and
browns
of
the
inland
scenery
conduce
to
the
tranquillity
of
the
time
,
 
<EOS>
the
time
of
peace
and
rest
before
the
fierce
and
stormy
winter
comes
on
.
<EOS>
It
seems
a
time
for
gathering
up
human
forces
to
encounter
the
coming
severity
,
as
well
as
of
storing
up
the
produce
of
harvest
for
the
needs
of
winter
.
<EOS>
Old
people
turn
out
and
sun
themselves
in
that
calm
St.
Martin
's
summer
,
without
fear
of
"
the
heat
o
'
th
'
sun
,
or
the
coming
winter
's
rages
,
"
and
we
may
read
in
their
pensive
,
dreamy
eyes
that
they
are
weaning
themselves
away
from
the
earth
,
which
probably
many
may
never
see
dressed
in
her
summer
glory
again
.
  
<EOS>
Many
such
old
people
set
out
betimes
,
on
the
Sunday
afternoon
to
which
Sylvia
had
been
so
looking
forward
,
to
scale
the
long
flights
of
stone
steps
 
worn
by
the
feet
of
many
generations
 
which
led
up
to
the
parish
church
,
placed
on
a
height
above
the
town
,
on
a
great
green
area
at
the
summit
of
the
cliff
,
which
was
the
angle
where
the
river
and
the
sea
met
,
and
so
overlooking
both
the
busy
crowded
little
town
,
the
port
,
the
shipping
,
and
the
bar
on
the
one
hand
,
and
the
wide
illimitable
tranquil
sea
on
the
other
 
types
of
life
and
eternity
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
good
situation
for
that
church
.
<EOS>
Homeward
-
bound
sailors
caught
sight
of
the
tower
of
St
Nicholas
,
the
first
land
object
of
all
.
<EOS>
They
who
went
forth
upon
the
great
deep
might
carry
solemn
thoughts
with
them
of
the
words
they
had
heard
there
;
not
conscious
thoughts
,
perhaps
 
rather
a
distinct
if
dim
conviction
that
buying
and
selling
,
eating
and
marrying
,
even
life
and
death
,
were
not
all
the
realities
in
existence
.
<EOS>
Nor
were
the
words
that
came
up
to
their
remembrance
words
of
sermons
preached
there
,
however
impressive
.
<EOS>
The
sailors
mostly
slept
through
the
sermons
;
unless
,
indeed
,
there
were
incidents
such
as
were
involved
in
what
were
called
"
funeral
discourses
"
to
be
narrated
.
<EOS>
They
did
not
recognize
their
daily
faults
or
temptations
under
the
grand
aliases
befitting
their
appearance
from
a
preacher
's
mouth
.
<EOS>
But
they
knew
the
old
,
oft
-
repeated
words
praying
for
deliverance
from
the
familiar
dangers
of
lightning
and
tempest
;
from
battle
,
murder
,
and
sudden
death
;
and
nearly
every
man
was
aware
that
he
left
behind
him
some
one
who
would
watch
for
the
prayer
for
the
preservation
of
those
who
travel
by
land
or
by
water
,
and
think
of
him
,
as
God
-
protected
the
more
for
the
earnestness
of
the
response
then
given
.
  
<EOS>
There
,
too
,
lay
the
dead
of
many
generations
;
for
St.
Nicholas
had
been
the
parish
church
ever
since
Monkshaven
was
a
town
,
and
the
large
churchyard
was
rich
in
the
dead
.
<EOS>
Masters
,
mariners
,
ship
-
owners
,
seamen
<EOS>
:
it
seemed
strange
how
few
other
trades
were
represented
in
that
great
plain
so
full
of
upright
gravestones
.
<EOS>
Here
and
there
was
a
memorial
stone
,
placed
by
some
survivor
of
a
large
family
,
most
of
whom
perished
at
sea
:
 
"
Supposed
to
have
perished
in
the
Greenland
seas
,
"
"
<EOS>
Shipwrecked
in
the
Baltic
,
"
"
Drowned
off
the
coast
of
Iceland
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
strange
sensation
,
as
if
the
cold
sea
-
winds
must
bring
with
them
the
dim
phantoms
of
those
lost
sailors
,
who
had
died
far
from
their
homes
,
and
from
the
hallowed
ground
where
their
fathers
lay
.
  
<EOS>
Each
flight
of
steps
up
to
this
churchyard
ended
in
a
small
flat
space
,
on
which
a
wooden
seat
was
placed
.
<EOS>
On
this
particular
Sunday
,
all
these
seats
were
filled
by
aged
people
,
breathless
with
the
unusual
exertion
of
climbing
.
<EOS>
You
could
see
the
church
stair
,
as
it
was
called
,
from
nearly
every
part
of
the
town
,
and
the
figures
of
the
numerous
climbers
,
diminished
by
distance
,
looked
like
a
busy
ant
-
hill
,
long
before
the
bell
began
to
ring
for
afternoon
service
.
<EOS>
All
who
could
manage
it
had
put
on
a
bit
of
black
in
token
of
mourning
;
it
might
be
very
little
;
an
old
ribbon
,
a
rusty
piece
of
crape
;
but
some
sign
of
mourning
was
shown
by
every
one
down
to
the
little
child
in
its
mother
's
arms
,
that
innocently
clutched
the
piece
of
rosemary
to
be
thrown
into
the
grave
"
for
remembrance
.
<EOS>
"
Darley
,
the
seaman
shot
by
the
press
-
gang
,
nine
leagues
off
St.
Abb
's
Head
,
was
to
be
buried
to
-
day
,
at
the
accustomed
time
for
the
funerals
of
the
poorer
classes
,
directly
after
evening
service
,
and
there
were
only
the
sick
and
their
nurse
-
tenders
who
did
not
come
forth
to
show
their
feeling
for
the
man
whom
they
looked
upon
as
murdered
.
<EOS>
The
crowd
of
vessels
in
harbour
bore
their
flags
<EOS>
half
-
mast
high
;
and
the
crews
were
making
their
way
through
the
High
Street
.
<EOS>
The
gentlefolk
of
Monkshaven
,
full
of
indignation
at
this
interference
with
their
ships
,
full
of
sympathy
with
the
family
who
had
lost
their
son
and
brother
almost
within
sight
of
his
home
,
came
in
unusual
numbers
 
<EOS>
no
lack
of
patterns
for
Sylvia
;
but
her
thoughts
were
far
otherwise
and
more
suitably
occupied
.
<EOS>
The
unwonted
sternness
and
solemnity
visible
on
the
countenances
of
all
whom
she
met
awed
and
affected
her
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
speak
in
reply
to
Molly
's
remarks
on
the
dress
or
appearance
of
those
who
struck
her
.
<EOS>
She
felt
as
if
these
speeches
jarred
on
her
,
and
annoyed
her
almost
to
irritation
;
yet
Molly
had
come
all
the
way
to
Monkshaven
Church
in
her
service
,
and
deserved
forbearance
accordingly
.
<EOS>
The
two
mounted
the
steps
alongside
of
many
people
;
few
words
were
exchanged
,
even
at
the
breathing
places
,
so
often
the
little
centres
of
gossip
.
<EOS>
Looking
over
the
sea
there
was
not
a
sail
to
be
seen
;
it
seemed
bared
of
life
,
as
if
to
be
in
serious
harmony
with
what
was
going
on
inland
.
  
<EOS>
The
church
was
of
old
Norman
architecture
;
low
and
massive
outside
:
inside
,
of
vast
space
,
only
a
quarter
of
which
was
filled
on
ordinary
Sundays
.
<EOS>
The
walls
were
disfigured
by
numerous
tablets
of
black
and
white
marble
intermixed
,
and
the
usual
ornamentation
of
that
style
of
memorial
as
erected
in
the
last
century
,
of
weeping
willows
,
urns
,
and
drooping
figures
,
with
here
and
there
a
ship
in
full
sail
,
or
an
anchor
,
where
the
seafaring
idea
prevalent
through
the
place
had
launched
out
into
a
little
originality
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
wood
-
work
,
the
church
had
been
stripped
of
that
,
most
probably
when
the
neighbouring
monastery
had
been
destroyed
.
<EOS>
There
were
large
square
pews
,
lined
with
green
baize
,
with
the
names
of
the
families
of
the
most
flourishing
ship
-
owners
painted
white
on
the
doors
;
there
were
pews
,
not
so
large
,
and
not
lined
at
all
,
for
the
farmers
and
shopkeepers
of
the
parish
;
and
numerous
heavy
oaken
benches
which
,
by
the
united
efforts
of
several
men
,
might
be
brought
within
earshot
of
the
pulpit
.
<EOS>
These
were
being
removed
into
the
most
convenient
situations
when
Molly
and
Sylvia
entered
the
church
,
and
after
two
or
three
whispered
sentences
they
took
their
seats
on
one
of
these
.
  
<EOS>
The
vicar
of
Monkshaven
was
a
kindly
,
peaceable
old
man
,
hating
strife
and
troubled
waters
above
everything
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
vehement
Tory
in
theory
,
as
became
his
cloth
in
those
days
.
<EOS>
He
had
two
bugbears
to
fear
 
the
French
and
the
Dissenters
.
<EOS>
It
was
difficult
to
say
of
which
he
had
the
worst
opinion
and
the
most
intense
dread
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
hated
the
Dissenters
most
,
because
they
came
nearer
in
contact
with
him
than
the
French
;
besides
,
the
French
had
the
excuse
of
being
Papists
,
while
the
Dissenters
might
have
belonged
to
the
Church
of
England
if
they
had
not
been
utterly
depraved
.
<EOS>
Yet
in
practice
Dr
Wilson
did
not
object
to
dine
with
Mr.
Fishburn
,
who
was
a
personal
friend
and
follower
of
Wesley
,
but
then
,
as
the
doctor
would
say
,
"
Wesley
was
an
Oxford
man
,
and
that
makes
him
a
gentleman
;
and
he
was
an
ordained
minister
of
the
Church
of
England
,
so
that
grace
can
never
depart
from
him
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
not
know
what
excuse
he
would
have
alleged
for
sending
broth
and
vegetables
to
old
Ralph
Thompson
,
a
rabid
Independent
,
who
had
been
given
to
abusing
the
Church
and
the
vicar
,
from
a
Dissenting
pulpit
,
as
long
as
ever
he
could
mount
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
However
,
that
inconsistency
between
Dr
Wilson
's
theories
and
practice
was
not
generally
known
in
Monkshaven
,
so
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
Dr
Wilson
had
had
a
very
difficult
part
to
play
,
and
a
still
more
difficult
sermon
to
write
,
during
this
last
week
.
<EOS>
The
Darley
who
had
been
killed
was
the
son
of
the
vicar
's
gardener
,
and
Dr
Wilson
's
sympathies
as
a
man
had
been
all
on
the
bereaved
father
's
side
.
<EOS>
But
then
he
had
received
,
as
the
oldest
magistrate
in
the
neighbourhood
,
a
letter
from
the
captain
of
the
_
Aurora
_
,
explanatory
and
exculpatory
.
<EOS>
Darley
had
been
resisting
the
orders
of
an
officer
in
his
Majesty
's
service
.
<EOS>
What
would
become
of
due
subordination
and
loyalty
,
and
the
interests
of
the
service
,
and
the
chances
of
beating
those
confounded
French
,
if
such
conduct
as
Darley
's
was
to
be
encouraged
?
<EOS>
(
Poor
Darley
!
<EOS>
he
was
past
all
evil
effects
of
human
encouragement
now
!
)
  
<EOS>
So
the
vicar
mumbled
hastily
over
a
sermon
on
the
text
,
"
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
life
we
are
in
death
"
;
which
might
have
done
as
well
for
a
baby
cut
off
in
a
convulsion
-
fit
as
for
the
strong
man
shot
down
with
all
his
eager
blood
hot
within
him
,
by
men
as
hot
-
blooded
as
himself
.
<EOS>
But
once
when
the
old
doctor
's
eye
caught
the
up
-
turned
,
straining
gaze
of
the
father
Darley
,
seeking
with
all
his
soul
to
find
a
grain
of
holy
comfort
in
the
chaff
of
words
,
his
conscience
smote
him
.
<EOS>
Had
he
nothing
to
say
that
should
calm
anger
and
revenge
with
spiritual
power
?
<EOS>
no
breath
of
the
comforter
to
soothe
repining
into
resignation
?
<EOS>
But
again
the
discord
between
the
laws
of
man
and
the
laws
of
Christ
stood
before
him
;
and
he
gave
up
the
attempt
to
do
more
than
he
was
doing
,
as
beyond
his
power
.
<EOS>
Though
the
hearers
went
away
as
full
of
anger
as
they
had
entered
the
church
,
and
some
with
a
dull
feeling
of
disappointment
as
to
what
they
had
got
there
,
yet
no
one
felt
anything
but
kindly
towards
the
old
vicar
.
<EOS>
His
simple
,
happy
life
led
amongst
them
for
forty
years
,
and
open
to
all
men
in
its
daily
course
;
his
sweet
-
tempered
,
cordial
ways
;
his
practical
kindness
,
made
him
beloved
by
all
;
and
neither
he
nor
<EOS>
they
thought
much
or
cared
much
for
admiration
of
his
talents
.
<EOS>
Respect
for
his
office
was
all
the
respect
he
thought
of
;
and
that
was
conceded
to
him
from
old
traditional
and
hereditary
association
.
<EOS>
In
looking
back
to
the
last
century
,
it
appears
curious
to
see
how
little
our
ancestors
had
the
power
of
putting
two
things
together
,
and
perceiving
either
the
discord
or
harmony
thus
produced
.
<EOS>
Is
it
because
we
are
farther
off
from
those
times
,
and
have
,
consequently
,
a
greater
range
of
vision
?
<EOS>
Will
our
descendants
have
a
wonder
about
us
,
such
as
we
have
about
the
inconsistency
of
our
forefathers
,
or
a
surprise
at
our
blindness
that
we
do
not
perceive
that
,
holding
such
and
such
opinions
,
our
course
of
action
must
be
so
and
so
,
or
that
the
logical
consequence
of
particular
opinions
must
be
convictions
which
at
present
we
hold
in
abhorrence
?
<EOS>
It
seems
puzzling
to
look
back
on
men
such
as
our
vicar
,
who
almost
held
the
doctrine
that
the
King
could
do
no
wrong
,
yet
were
ever
ready
to
talk
of
the
glorious
Revolution
,
and
to
abuse
the
Stuarts
for
having
entertained
the
same
doctrine
,
and
tried
to
put
it
in
practice
.
<EOS>
But
such
discrepancies
ran
through
good
men
's
lives
in
those
days
.
<EOS>
It
is
well
for
us
that
we
live
at
the
present
time
,
when
everybody
is
logical
and
consistent
.
<EOS>
This
little
discussion
must
be
taken
in
place
of
Dr
Wilson
's
sermon
,
of
which
no
one
could
remember
more
than
the
text
half
an
hour
after
it
was
delivered
.
<EOS>
Even
the
doctor
himself
had
the
recollection
of
the
words
he
had
uttered
swept
out
of
his
mind
,
<EOS>
as
,
having
doffed
his
gown
and
donned
his
surplice
,
he
came
out
of
the
dusk
of
his
vestry
and
went
to
the
church
-
door
,
looking
into
the
broad
light
which
came
upon
the
plain
of
the
church
-
yard
on
the
cliffs
;
for
the
sun
had
not
yet
set
,
and
the
pale
moon
was
slowly
rising
through
the
silvery
mist
that
obscured
the
distant
moors
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
thick
,
dense
crowd
,
all
still
and
silent
,
looking
away
from
the
church
and
the
vicar
,
who
awaited
the
bringing
of
the
dead
.
<EOS>
They
were
watching
the
slow
black
line
winding
up
the
long
steps
,
resting
their
heavy
burden
here
<EOS>
and
there
,
standing
in
silent
groups
at
each
landing
-
place
;
now
lost
to
sight
as
a
piece
of
broken
,
overhanging
ground
intervened
,
now
emerging
suddenly
nearer
;
and
overhead
the
great
church
bell
,
with
its
mediaeval
inscription
,
familiar
to
the
vicar
,
if
to
no
one
else
who
heard
it
,
<EOS>
I
to
the
grave
do
summon
all
,
kept
on
its
heavy
booming
monotone
,
with
which
no
other
sound
from
land
or
sea
,
near
or
distant
,
intermingled
,
except
the
cackle
of
the
geese
on
some
far
-
away
farm
on
the
moors
,
as
they
were
coming
home
to
roost
;
and
that
one
noise
from
so
great
a
distance
seemed
only
to
deepen
the
stillness
.
<EOS>
Then
there
was
a
little
movement
in
the
crowd
;
a
little
pushing
from
side
to
side
,
to
make
a
path
for
the
corpse
and
its
bearers
 
an
aggregate
of
the
fragments
of
room
.
  
<EOS>
With
bent
heads
and
spent
strength
,
those
who
carried
the
coffin
moved
on
;
behind
came
the
poor
old
gardener
,
a
brown
-
black
funeral
cloak
thrown
over
his
homely
dress
,
and
supporting
his
wife
with
steps
scarcely
less
feeble
than
her
own
.
<EOS>
He
had
come
to
church
that
afternoon
,
with
a
promise
to
her
that
he
would
return
to
lead
her
to
the
funeral
of
her
firstborn
;
for
he
felt
,
in
his
sore
perplexed
heart
,
full
of
indignation
and
dumb
anger
,
as
if
he
must
go
and
hear
something
which
should
exorcize
the
unwonted
longing
for
revenge
that
disturbed
his
grief
,
and
made
him
conscious
of
that
great
blank
of
consolation
which
faithfulness
produces
.
<EOS>
And
for
the
time
he
was
faithless
.
<EOS>
How
came
God
to
permit
such
cruel
injustice
of
man
?
<EOS>
Permitting
it
,
He
could
not
be
good
.
<EOS>
Then
what
was
life
,
and
what
was
death
,
but
woe
and
despair
?
<EOS>
The
beautiful
solemn
words
of
the
ritual
had
done
him
good
,
and
restored
much
of
his
faith
.
<EOS>
Though
he
could
not
understand
why
such
sorrow
had
befallen
him
any
more
than
before
,
he
had
come
back
to
something
of
his
childlike
trust
;
he
kept
saying
to
himself
in
a
whisper
,
as
he
mounted
the
weary
steps
,
"
It
is
the
Lord
's
doing
"
;
and
the
repetition
soothed
him
unspeakably
.
<EOS>
Behind
this
old
couple
followed
their
children
,
grown
men
and
women
,
come
from
distant
place
or
farmhouse
service
;
the
servants
at
the
vicarage
,
and
many
a
neighbour
,
anxious
to
show
their
sympathy
,
and
most
of
the
sailors
from
the
crews
of
the
vessels
in
port
,
joined
in
procession
,
and
followed
the
dead
body
into
the
church
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
too
great
a
crowd
immediately
within
the
door
for
Sylvia
and
Molly
to
go
in
again
,
and
they
accordingly
betook
themselves
to
the
place
where
the
deep
grave
was
waiting
,
wide
and
hungry
,
to
receive
its
dead
.
<EOS>
There
,
leaning
against
the
headstones
all
around
,
were
many
standing
 
looking
over
the
broad
and
placid
sea
,
and
turned
to
the
soft
salt
air
which
blew
on
their
hot
eyes
and
rigid
faces
;
for
no
one
spoke
of
all
that
number
.
<EOS>
They
were
thinking
of
the
violent
death
of
him
over
whom
the
solemn
words
were
now
being
said
in
the
gray
old
church
,
scarcely
out
of
their
hearing
,
had
not
the
sound
been
broken
by
the
measured
lapping
of
the
tide
far
beneath
.
  
<EOS>
Suddenly
every
one
looked
round
towards
the
path
from
the
churchyard
steps
.
<EOS>
Two
sailors
were
supporting
a
ghastly
figure
that
,
with
feeble
motions
,
was
drawing
near
the
open
grave
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
t
'
specksioneer
as
tried
to
save
him
!
<EOS>
It
's
him
as
was
left
for
dead
!
"
<EOS>
the
people
murmured
round
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
Charley
Kinraid
,
as
I
'm
a
sinner
!
"
<EOS>
said
Molly
,
starting
forward
to
greet
her
cousin
.
  
<EOS>
But
as
he
came
on
,
she
saw
that
all
his
strength
was
needed
for
the
mere
action
of
walking
.
<EOS>
The
sailors
,
in
their
strong
sympathy
,
had
yielded
to
his
earnest
entreaty
,
and
carried
him
up
the
steps
,
in
order
that
he
might
see
the
last
of
his
messmate
.
<EOS>
They
placed
him
near
the
grave
,
resting
against
a
stone
;
and
he
was
hardly
there
before
the
vicar
came
forth
,
and
the
great
crowd
poured
out
of
the
church
,
following
the
body
to
the
grave
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
was
so
much
wrapt
up
in
the
solemnity
of
the
occasion
,
that
she
had
no
thought
to
spare
at
the
first
moment
for
the
pale
and
haggard
figure
opposite
;
much
less
was
she
aware
of
her
cousin
Philip
,
who
now
singling
her
out
for
the
first
time
from
among
the
crowd
,
pressed
to
her
side
,
with
an
intention
of
companionship
and
protection
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
service
went
on
,
ill
-
checked
sobs
rose
from
behind
the
two
girls
,
who
were
among
the
foremost
in
the
crowd
,
and
by
-
and
-
by
the
cry
and
the
wail
became
general
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
's
tears
rained
down
her
face
,
and
her
distress
became
so
evident
that
it
attracted
the
attention
of
many
in
that
inner
circle
.
<EOS>
Among
others
who
noticed
it
,
the
specksioneer
's
hollow
eyes
were
caught
by
the
sight
of
the
innocent
blooming
childlike
face
opposite
to
him
,
and
he
wondered
if
she
were
a
relation
;
yet
,
seeing
that
she
bore
no
badge
of
mourning
,
he
rather
concluded
that
she
must
have
been
a
sweetheart
of
the
dead
man
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
all
was
over
:
the
rattle
of
the
gravel
on
the
coffin
;
the
last
long
,
lingering
look
of
friends
and
lovers
;
the
rosemary
sprigs
had
been
cast
down
by
all
who
were
fortunate
enough
to
have
brought
them
 
<EOS>
and
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
how
much
Sylvia
wished
she
had
remembered
this
last
act
of
respect
 
and
slowly
the
outer
rim
of
the
crowd
began
to
slacken
and
disappear
.
  
<EOS>
Now
Philip
spoke
to
Sylvia
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
dreamt
of
seeing
you
here
.
<EOS>
I
thought
my
aunt
always
went
to
Kirk
Moorside
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
came
with
Molly
Corney
,
"
said
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
"
Mother
is
staying
at
home
with
feyther
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
's
his
rheumatics
?
"
asked
Philip
.
  
<EOS>
But
at
the
same
moment
Molly
took
hold
of
Sylvia
's
hand
,
and
said
    
"
A
want
t
'
get
round
and
speak
to
Charley
.
<EOS>
Mother
'll
be
main
and
glad
to
hear
as
he
's
getten
out
;
though
,
for
sure
,
he
looks
as
though
he
'd
ha
'
been
better
in
's
bed
.
<EOS>
Come
,
Sylvia
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
Philip
,
fain
to
keep
with
Sylvia
,
had
to
follow
the
two
girls
close
up
to
the
specksioneer
,
who
was
preparing
for
his
slow
laborious
walk
back
to
his
lodgings
.
<EOS>
He
stopped
on
seeing
his
cousin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Molly
,
"
said
he
,
faintly
,
putting
out
his
hand
,
but
his
eye
passing
her
face
to
look
at
Sylvia
in
the
background
,
her
tear
-
stained
face
full
of
shy
admiration
of
the
nearest
approach
to
a
hero
she
had
ever
seen
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Charley
,
a
niver
was
so
taken
aback
as
when
a
saw
yo
'
theere
,
like
a
ghost
,
a
-
standin
'
agin
a
gravestone
.
<EOS>
How
white
and
wan
yo
'
do
look
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
"
said
he
,
wearily
,
"
wan
and
weak
enough
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
hope
you
're
getting
better
,
sir
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
in
a
low
voice
,
longing
to
speak
to
him
,
and
yet
wondering
at
her
own
temerity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
my
lass
.
<EOS>
I
'm
o'er
th
'
worst
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
sighed
heavily
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
now
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
're
doing
him
no
kindness
a
-
keeping
him
<EOS>
standing
here
<EOS>
i
'
t
'
night
-
fall
,
and
him
so
tired
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
he
made
as
though
he
would
turn
away
.
<EOS>
Kinraid
's
two
sailor
friends
backed
up
Philip
's
words
with
such
urgency
,
that
,
somehow
,
Sylvia
thought
they
had
been
to
blame
in
speaking
to
him
,
and
blushed
excessively
with
the
idea
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yo'll
come
and
be
nursed
at
Moss
Brow
,
Charley
,
"
said
Molly
;
and
Sylvia
dropped
her
little
maidenly
curtsey
,
and
said
,
"
Good
-
by
;
"
and
went
away
,
wondering
how
Molly
could
talk
so
freely
to
such
a
hero
;
but
then
,
to
be
sure
,
he
was
a
cousin
,
and
probably
a
sweetheart
,
and
that
would
make
a
great
deal
of
difference
,
of
course
.
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
her
own
cousin
kept
close
by
her
side
.
    
<EOS>
TETE
-
A
-
TETE
.
 
<EOS>
THE
WILL
  
"
And
now
tell
me
all
about
th
'
folk
at
home
?
<EOS>
"
said
Philip
,
evidently
preparing
to
walk
back
with
the
girls
.
<EOS>
He
generally
came
to
Haytersbank
every
Sunday
afternoon
,
so
Sylvia
knew
what
she
had
to
expect
the
moment
she
became
aware
of
his
neighbourhood
in
the
churchyard
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
feyther
's
been
sadly
troubled
with
his
rheumatics
this
week
past
;
but
he
's
a
vast
better
now
,
thank
you
kindly
.
"
<EOS>
Then
,
addressing
herself
to
Molly
,
she
asked
,
"
Has
your
cousin
a
doctor
to
look
after
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
for
sure
!
"
said
Molly
,
quickly
;
for
though
she
knew
nothing
about
the
matter
,
she
was
determined
to
suppose
that
her
cousin
had
everything
becoming
an
invalid
as
well
as
a
hero
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
well
-
to
-
do
,
and
can
afford
everything
as
he
needs
,
"
continued
she
.
"
<EOS>
His
feyther
's
left
him
money
,
and
he
were
a
farmer
out
up
in
Northumberland
,
and
he
's
reckoned
such
a
specksioneer
as
never
,
never
was
,
and
gets
what
wage
he
asks
for
and
a
share
on
every
whale
he
harpoons
beside
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
reckon
he
'll
have
to
make
himself
scarce
on
this
coast
for
awhile
,
at
any
rate
,
"
said
Philip
.
  
<EOS>
"
An
'
what
for
should
he
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Molly
,
who
never
liked
Philip
at
the
best
of
times
,
and
now
,
if
he
was
going
to
disparage
her
cousin
in
any
way
,
was
ready
to
take
up
arms
and
do
battle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
they
do
say
as
he
fired
the
shot
as
has
killed
some
o
'
the
men
-
o
'
 
war
's
men
,
and
,
of
course
,
if
he
has
,
he
'll
have
to
stand
his
trial
if
he
's
caught
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
lies
people
do
say
!
"
exclaimed
Molly
.
"
<EOS>
He
niver
killed
nought
but
whales
,
a'll
be
bound
;
or
,
if
he
did
,
it
were
all
right
and
proper
as
he
should
,
when
they
were
for
stealing
him
an
'
all
t
'
others
,
and
did
kill
poor
Darley
as
we
come
fra
'
seeming
buried
.
<EOS>
A
suppose
,
now
yo're
<EOS>
such
a
Quaker
that
,
if
some
one
was
to
break
through
fra

<EOS>
o

this

yo'd

yo'r

hanging
by
yo'r
side

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
t
'
press
-
gang
had
law
on
their
side
,
and
were
doing
nought
but
what
they
'd
warrant
for

<EOS>
"
  
"
Th
'
tender
's
gone
away
,
as
if
she
were
ashamed
o

what

said
Sylvia
,
"
and
t

flag
's
down
fra

<EOS>
o'er
<EOS>
the
Randyvowse
.
<EOS>
There
'll
be

ganging

awhile
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
feyther
says
,
"
continued
Molly
,
"
as
they
've
made
t
'
place
too
hot

"
  
<EOS>
"
Women

so
fond

said
Philip
;
"
for

thought
you

just
come
fra

<EOS>
I
should

enough

sorrow
comes

fighting

<EOS>
Why

them

t

<EOS>
_
Aurora
_
<EOS>
as
they
say
Kinraid

a

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
he
could
ha
'
killed
them
,
"
said
Sylvia
;
"
he
looked
so
gentle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
Molly
did
not
like
this
half
-
and
-
half
view
of
the
case
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
dare
say
he
did
kill
'em
dead
;
he
's
not
one
to
do
things
by
halves
.
<EOS>
And
a
think
he
served
'em
reet
<EOS>
,
that
's
what
a
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
na
'
this
Hester
,
as
serves
in
Foster
's
shop
?
"
asked
Sylvia
,
in
a
low
voice
,
as
a
young
woman
came
through
a
stile
in
the
stone
wall
by
the
roadside
,
and
suddenly
appeared
before
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Philip
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Hester
,
where
have
you
been
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
as
they
drew
near
.
  
<EOS>
Hester
reddened
a
little
,
and
then
replied
,
in
her
slow
,
quiet
way
    
<EOS>
"
I
've
been
sitting
with
Betsy
Darley
 
her
that
is
bed
-
ridden
.
<EOS>
It
were
lonesome
for
her
when
the
others
were
away
at
the
burying
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
she
made
as
though
she
would
have
passed
;
but
Sylvia
,
all
her
sympathies
alive
for
the
relations
of
the
murdered
man
,
wanted
to
ask
more
questions
,
and
put
her
hand
on
Hester
's
arm
to
detain
her
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Hester
suddenly
drew
back
a
little
,
reddened
still
more
,
and
then
replied
fully
and
quietly
to
all
Sylvia
asked
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
agricultural
counties
,
and
among
the
class
to
which
these
four
persons
belonged
,
there
is
little
analysis
of
motive
or
comparison
of
characters
and
actions
,
even
at
this
present
day
of
enlightenment
.
<EOS>
Sixty
or
seventy
years
ago
there
was
still
less
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
that
amongst
thoughtful
and
serious
people
there
was
not
much
reading
of
such
books
as
_
Mason
_
on
_
Self
-
Knowledge
_
and
_
Law
's
Serious
Call
_
,
or
that
there
were
not
the
experiences
of
the
Wesleyans
,
that
were
related
at
class
-
meeting
for
the
edification
of
the
hearers
.
<EOS>
But
,
taken
as
a
general
ride
,
it
may
be
said
that
few
knew
what
manner
of
men
they
were
,
compared
to
the
numbers
now
who
are
fully
conscious
of
their
virtues
,
qualities
,
failings
,
and
weaknesses
,
and
who
go
about
comparing
others
with
themselves
 
not
in
a
spirit
of
Pharisaism
and
arrogance
,
but
with
a
vivid
self
-
consciousness
that
more
than
anything
else
deprives
characters
of
freshness
and
originality
.
  
<EOS>
To
return
to
the
party
we
left
standing
on
the
high
-
raised
footway
that
ran
alongside
of
the
bridle
-
road
to
Haytersbank
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
had
leisure
in
her
heart
to
think
"
how
good
Hester
is
for
sitting
with
the
poor
bed
-
ridden
sister
of
Darley
!
"
<EOS>
without
having
a
pang
of
self
-
depreciation
in
the
comparison
of
her
own
conduct
with
that
she
was
capable
of
so
fully
appreciating
.
<EOS>
She
had
gone
to
church
for
the
ends
of
vanity
,
and
remained
to
the
funeral
for
curiosity
and
the
pleasure
of
the
excitement
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
a
modern
young
lady
would
have
condemned
herself
,
and
therefore
lost
the
simple
,
purifying
pleasure
of
admiration
of
another
.
  
<EOS>
Hester
passed
onwards
,
going
down
the
hill
towards
the
town
.
<EOS>
The
other
three
walked
slowly
on
.
<EOS>
All
were
silent
for
a
few
moments
,
then
Sylvia
said
    
"
How
good
she
is
!
"
  
<EOS>
And
Philip
replied
with
ready
warmth
,
    
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
she
is
;
no
one
knows
how
good
but
us
,
who
live
in
the
same
house
wi
'
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Her
mother
is
an
old
Quakeress
,
<EOS>
bean't
she
?
"
<EOS>
Molly
inquired
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Alice
Rose
is
a
Friend
,
if
that
is
what
you
mean
,
"
said
Philip
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
well
!
<EOS>
some
folk
's
so
particular
.
<EOS>
Is
William
Coulson
a
Quaker
,
by
which
a
mean
a
Friend
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
they
're
all
on
'em
right
-
down
good
folk
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Deary
me
!
<EOS>
What
a
wonder
yo
'
can
speak
to
such
sinners
as
Sylvia
and
me
,
after
keepin
'
company
with
so
much
goodness
,
"
said
Molly
,
who
had
not
yet
forgiven
Philip
for
doubting
Kinraid
's
power
of
killing
men
.
<EOS>
"
Is
na
'
it
,
Sylvia
?
"
  
<EOS>
But
Sylvia
was
too
highly
strung
for
banter
.
<EOS>
If
she
had
not
been
one
of
those
who
went
to
mock
,
but
remained
to
pray
,
she
had
gone
to
church
with
the
thought
of
the
cloak
-
that
-
was
-
to
-
be
uppermost
in
her
mind
,
and
she
had
come
down
the
long
church
stair
with
life
and
death
suddenly
become
real
to
her
mind
,
the
enduring
sea
and
hills
forming
a
contrasting
background
to
the
vanishing
away
of
man
.
<EOS>
She
was
full
of
a
solemn
wonder
as
to
the
abiding
-
place
of
the
souls
of
the
dead
,
and
a
childlike
dread
lest
the
number
of
the
elect
should
be
accomplished
before
she
was
included
therein
.
<EOS>
How
people
could
ever
be
merry
again
after
they
had
been
at
a
funeral
<EOS>
,
she
could
not
imagine
;
so
she
answered
gravely
,
and
slightly
beside
the
question
:
  
"
I
wonder
if
I
was
a
Friend
if
I
should
be
good
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Gi
<EOS>
'
me
<EOS>
your
red
cloak
<EOS>
,
that
's
all
,
when
yo
'
turn
Quaker
;
they
'll
none
let
thee
wear
scarlet
,
so
it
'll
be
of
no
use
t
'
thee
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
thou'rt
good
enough
as
thou
art
,
"
said
Philip
,
tenderly
 
at
least
as
tenderly
as
he
durst
,
for
he
knew
by
experience
that
it
did
not
do
to
alarm
her
girlish
coyness
.
<EOS>
Either
one
speech
or
the
other
made
Sylvia
silent
;
neither
was
accordant
to
her
mood
of
mind
;
so
perhaps
both
contributed
to
her
quietness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Folk
say
William
Coulson
looks
sweet
on
Hester
Rose
,
"
said
Molly
,
always
up
in
Monkshaven
gossip
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
the
form
of
an
assertion
,
but
was
said
in
the
tone
of
a
question
,
and
as
such
Philip
replied
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
think
he
likes
her
a
good
deal
;
but
he
's
so
quiet
<EOS>
,
I
never
feel
sure
.
<EOS>
John
and
Jeremiah
would
like
the
match
,
I
've
a
notion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
now
they
came
to
the
stile
which
had
filled
Philip
's
eye
for
some
minutes
past
,
though
neither
of
the
others
had
perceived
they
were
so
near
it
;
the
stile
which
led
to
Moss
Brow
from
the
road
into
the
fields
that
sloped
down
to
Haystersbank
.
<EOS>
Here
they
would
leave
Molly
,
and
now
would
begin
the
delicious
_
tete
-
a
-
tete
_
walk
,
which
Philip
always
tried
to
make
as
lingering
as
possible
.
<EOS>
To
-
day
he
was
anxious
to
show
his
sympathy
with
Sylvia
,
as
far
as
he
could
read
what
was
passing
in
her
mind
;
but
how
was
he
to
guess
the
multitude
of
tangled
thoughts
in
that
unseen
receptacle
?
<EOS>
A
resolution
to
be
good
,
if
she
could
,
and
always
to
be
thinking
on
death
,
so
that
what
seemed
to
her
now
as
simply
impossible
,
might
come
true
 
that
she
might
"
dread
the
grave
as
little
as
her
bed
"
;
a
wish
that
Philip
were
not
coming
home
with
her
;
a
wonder
if
the
specksioneer
really
had
killed
a
man
,
an
idea
which
made
her
shudder
;
yet
from
the
awful
fascination
about
it
,
her
imagination
was
compelled
to
dwell
on
the
tall
,
gaunt
figure
,
and
try
to
recall
the
wan
countenance
;
a
hatred
and
desire
of
revenge
on
the
press
-
gang
,
so
vehement
that
it
sadly
militated
against
her
intention
of
trying
to
be
good
;
all
these
notions
,
and
wonders
,
and
fancies
,
were
whirling
about
in
Sylvia
's
brain
,
and
at
one
of
their
promptings
she
spoke
,
    
"
How
many
miles
away
is
t
'
Greenland
seas
?
 
<EOS>
I
mean
,
how
long
do
they
take
to
reach
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
;
<EOS>
ten
days
or
a
fortnight
,
or
more
,
maybe
.
<EOS>
I
'll
ask
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
feyther
'll
tell
me
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
He
's
been
there
many
a
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
Sylvie
!
<EOS>
My
aunt
said
I
were
to
give
you
lessons
this
winter
<EOS>
i
'
writing
and
ciphering
.
<EOS>
I
can
begin
to
come
up
now
,
two
evenings
,
maybe
,
a
week
.
<EOS>
T
'
shop
closes
early
after
November
comes
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
did
not
like
learning
,
and
did
not
want
him
for
her
teacher
;
so
she
answered
in
a
dry
little
tone
,
    
<EOS>
"
It
'll
use
a
deal
o
'
candle
-
light
;
mother
'll
not
like
that
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
see
to
spell
wi'out
a
candle
close
at
my
elbow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Niver
mind
about
candles
.
<EOS>
I
can
bring
up
a
candle
wi
'
me
,
for
I
should
be
burning
one
at
Alice
Rose
's
.
"
  
<EOS>
So
that
excuse
would
not
do
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
beat
her
brains
for
another
.
  
<EOS>
"
Writing
cramps
my
hand
<EOS>
so
,
I
ca
n't
do
any
sewing
for
a
day
after
;
and
feyther
wants
his
shirts
very
bad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
Sylvia
,
I
'll
teach
you
geography
,
and
<EOS>
ever
such
a
vast
o
'
fine
things
about
t
'
countries
,
on
t
'
map
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
t
'
Arctic
seas
down
on
t
'
map
?
"
she
asked
,
in
a
tone
of
greater
interest
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
Arctics
,
and
tropics
,
and
equator
,
and
equinoctial
line
<EOS>
;
we
'll
take
'em
turn
and
turn
about
;
we
'll
do
writing
and
ciphering
one
night
,
and
geography
t
'
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
spoke
with
pleasure
at
the
prospect
,
but
Sylvia
relaxed
into
indifference
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
no
scholard
;
it
's
like
throwing
away
labour
to
teach
me
,
I
'm
such
a
dunce
at
my
book
.
<EOS>
Now
there
's
Betsy
Corney
,
third
girl
,
her
as
is
younger
than
Molly
<EOS>
,
she
'd
be
a
credit
to
you
.
<EOS>
There
niver
was
such
a
lass
for
pottering
ower
books
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
If
Philip
had
had
his
wits
about
him
,
he
would
have
pretended
to
listen
to
this
proposition
of
a
change
of
pupils
,
and
then
possibly
Sylvia
might
have
repented
making
it
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
too
much
mortified
to
be
diplomatic
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
aunt
asked
me
to
teach
_
you
_
a
bit
,
not
any
neighbour
's
lass
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
if
I
mun
be
taught
,
I
mun
;
<EOS>
but
I
'd
rayther
be
whipped
and
ha
'
done
with
it
,
"
was
Sylvia
's
ungracious
reply
.
  
<EOS>
A
moment
afterwards
,
she
repented
of
her
little
spirit
of
unkindness
,
and
thought
that
she
should
not
like
to
die
that
night
without
making
friends
.
<EOS>
Sudden
death
was
very
present
in
her
thoughts
since
the
funeral
.
<EOS>
So
she
instinctively
chose
the
best
method
of
making
friends
again
,
and
slipped
her
hand
into
his
,
as
he
walked
a
little
sullenly
at
her
side
.
<EOS>
She
was
half
afraid
,
however
,
when
she
found
it
firmly
held
,
and
that
she
could
not
draw
it
away
again
without
making
what
she
called
in
her
own
mind
a
"
fuss
.
"
<EOS>
So
,
hand
in
hand
,
they
slowly
and
silently
came
up
to
the
door
of
Haytersbank
Farm
;
not
unseen
by
Bell
Robson
,
who
sate
in
the
window
-
seat
,
with
her
Bible
open
upon
her
knee
.
<EOS>
She
had
read
her
chapter
aloud
to
herself
,
and
now
she
could
see
no
longer
,
even
if
she
had
wished
to
read
more
;
but
she
gazed
out
into
the
darkening
air
,
and
a
dim
look
of
contentment
came
like
moonshine
over
her
face
when
she
saw
the
cousins
approach
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
my
prayer
day
and
night
,
"
said
she
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
unusual
aspect
of
gladness
on
her
face
,
as
she
lighted
the
candle
to
give
them
a
more
cheerful
welcome
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wheere
's
feyther
?
"
said
Sylvia
,
looking
round
the
room
for
Daniel
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
been
to
Kirk
Moorside
Church
,
for
t
'
see
a
bit
o
<EOS>
'
th
'
world
,
as
he
ca
's
it
.
<EOS>
And
sin
'
then
he
's
gone
out
to
th
'
cattle
;
for
Kester
's
ta'en
<EOS>
his
turn
of
playing
hissel
'
,
now
that
father
's
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
been
talking
to
Sylvia
,
"
said
Philip
,
his
head
still
full
of
his
pleasant
plan
,
his
hand
still
tingling
from
the
touch
of
hers
,
"
about
turning
schoolmaster
,
and
coming
up
here
two
nights
a
week
for
t
'
<EOS>
teach
her
a
bit
o
'
writing
and
ciphering
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
geography
,
"
put
in
Sylvia
;
"
for
,
"
thought
she
,
"
if
I
'm
to
learn
them
things
I
do
n't
care
a
pin
about
,
anyhow
I
'll
learn
what
I
do
care
to
know
,
if
it
'll
tell
me
about
t
'
Greenland
seas
,
and
how
far
they
're
off
.
"
  
<EOS>
That
same
evening
,
a
trio
alike
in
many
outward
circumstances
sate
in
a
small
neat
room
in
a
house
opening
out
of
a
confined
court
on
the
hilly
side
of
the
High
Street
of
Monkshaven
 
a
mother
,
her
only
child
,
and
the
young
man
who
silently
loved
that
daughter
,
and
was
favoured
by
Alice
Rose
,
though
not
by
Hester
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
latter
returned
from
her
afternoon
's
absence
,
she
stood
for
a
minute
or
two
on
the
little
flight
of
steep
steps
,
whitened
to
a
snowy
whiteness
;
the
aspect
of
the
whole
house
partook
of
the
same
character
of
irreproachable
cleanliness
.
<EOS>
It
was
wedged
up
into
a
space
which
necessitated
all
sorts
of
odd
projections
and
irregularities
in
order
to
obtain
sufficient
light
for
the
interior
;
and
if
ever
the
being
situated
in
a
dusky
,
confined
corner
might
have
been
made
an
excuse
for
dirt
,
Alice
Rose
's
house
had
that
apology
.
<EOS>
Yet
the
small
diamond
panes
of
glass
in
the
casement
window
were
kept
so
bright
and
clear
that
a
great
sweet
-
scented
-
leaved
geranium
grew
and
flourished
,
though
it
did
not
flower
profusely
.
<EOS>
The
leaves
seemed
to
fill
the
air
with
fragrance
as
soon
as
Hester
summoned
up
energy
enough
to
open
the
door
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
that
was
because
the
young
Quaker
,
William
Coulson
,
was
crushing
one
between
his
finger
and
thumb
,
while
waiting
to
set
down
Alice
's
next
words
.
<EOS>
For
the
old
woman
,
who
looked
as
if
many
years
of
life
remained
in
her
yet
,
was
solemnly
dictating
her
last
will
and
testament
.
  
<EOS>
It
had
been
on
her
mind
for
many
months
;
for
she
had
something
to
leave
beyond
the
mere
furniture
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Something
 
<EOS>
a
few
pounds
 
in
the
hands
of
John
and
Jeremiah
Foster
,
her
cousins
:
and
it
was
they
who
had
suggested
the
duty
on
which
she
was
engaged
.
<EOS>
She
had
asked
William
Coulson
to
write
down
her
wishes
,
and
he
had
consented
,
though
with
some
fear
and
trepidation
;
for
he
had
an
idea
that
he
was
infringing
on
a
lawyer
's
prerogative
,
and
that
,
for
aught
he
knew
,
he
might
be
prosecuted
for
making
a
will
without
a
licence
,
just
as
a
man
might
be
punished
for
selling
wine
and
spirits
without
going
through
the
preliminary
legal
forms
that
give
permission
for
such
a
sale
.
<EOS>
But
to
his
suggestion
that
Alice
should
employ
a
lawyer
,
she
had
replied
    
"
That
would
cost
me
five
pounds
sterling
;
and
thee
canst
do
it
as
well
,
if
thee'll
<EOS>
but
attend
to
my
words
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
he
had
bought
,
at
her
desire
,
a
black
-
edged
sheet
of
fine
-
wove
paper
,
and
a
couple
of
good
pens
,
on
the
previous
Saturday
;
and
while
waiting
for
her
to
begin
her
dictation
,
and
full
serious
thought
himself
,
he
had
almost
unconsciously
made
the
grand
flourish
at
the
top
of
the
paper
which
he
had
learnt
at
school
,
and
which
was
there
called
a
spread
-
eagle
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
art
thee
doing
there
?
"
asked
Alice
,
suddenly
alive
to
his
proceedings
.
  
<EOS>
Without
a
word
he
showed
her
his
handiwork
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
vanity
,
"
said
she
,
"
and
'
t
may
make
t
'
will
not
stand
.
<EOS>
Folk
may
think
I
were
na
in
my
right
mind
,
if
they
see
such
fly
-
legs
and
cob
-
webs
a
-
top
.
<EOS>
Write
,
"
<EOS>
This
is
my
doing
,
William
Coulson
,
and
none
of
Alice
Rose
's
,
she
being
in
her
sound
mind
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
do
n't
think
it
's
needed
,
"
said
William
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
he
wrote
down
the
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hast
thee
put
that
I
'm
in
my
sound
mind
and
seven
senses
?
<EOS>
Then
make
the
sign
of
the
Trinity
,
and
write
,
"
In
the
name
of
the
Father
,
the
Son
,
and
the
Holy
Ghost
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
Is
that
the
right
way
o
'
beginning
a
will
?
"
said
Coulson
,
a
little
startled
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
father
,
and
my
father
's
father
,
and
my
husband
had
it
a
-
top
of
theirs
,
and
I
'm
noane
going
for
to
cease
fra
'
following
after
them
,
for
they
were
godly
men
,
though
my
husband
were
o
'
t
'
episcopal
persuasion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
done
,
"
said
William
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hast
thee
dated
it
?
"
asked
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
date
it
third
day
,
ninth
month
.
<EOS>
Now
,
art
ready
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Coulson
nodded
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
,
Alice
Rose
,
do
leave
my
furniture
(
that
is
,
my
bed
and
chest
o
'
drawers
,
for
thy
bed
and
things
is
thine
,
and
not
mine
)
,
and
settle
,
and
saucepans
,
and
dresser
,
and
table
,
and
kettle
,
and
all
the
rest
of
my
furniture
,
to
my
lawful
and
only
daughter
,
Hester
Rose
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
's
safe
for
her
to
have
all
,
is
'
t
not
,
William
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
,
too
,
"
said
he
,
writing
on
all
the
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
thee
shalt
have
t
'
roller
and
paste
-
board
,
because
thee
's
so
fond
o
'
puddings
and
cakes
.
<EOS>
It
'll
serve
thy
wife
after
I
'm
gone
,
and
I
trust
she
'll
boil
her
paste
long
enough
,
for
that
's
been
t
'
secret
o
'
mine
,
and
thee'll
noane
be
so
easy
t

please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
din't
reckon
on
marriage
,
"
said
William
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thee'll
marry
,
"
said
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Thee
likes
to
have
thy
victuals
hot
and
comfortable
;
and
there
's
noane
many
but
a
wife
as'll
look
after
that
for
t

please
thee
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
who
could
please
me
,
"
sighed
forth
William
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
ca
n't
please
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
looked
sharply
at
him
from
over
her
spectacles
,
which
she
had
put
on
the
better
to
think
about
the
disposal
of
her
property
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thee
art
thinking
on
our
Hester
,
"
said
she
,
plainly
out
.
  
<EOS>
He
started
a
little
,
but
looked
up
at
her
and
met
her
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hester
cares
noane
for
me
,
"
said
he
,
dejectedly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bide
a
while
,
my
lad
,
"
said
Alice
,
kindly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Young
women
do
n't
always
know
their
own
minds
.
<EOS>
Thee
and
her
would
make
a
marriage
after
my
own
heart
;
and
the
Lord
has
been
very
good
to
me
hitherto
,
and
I
think
He
'll
bring
it
t
'
pass
.
<EOS>
But
do
n't
thee
let
on
as
thee
cares
for
her
so
much
.
<EOS>
I
sometimes
think
she
wearies
o
'
thy
looks
and
thy
ways
.
<EOS>
Show
up
thy
manly
heart
,
and
make
as
though
thee
had
much
else
to
think
on
,
and
no
leisure
for
to
dawdle
after
her
,
and
she
'll
think
a
deal
more
on
thee
.
<EOS>
And
now
mend
thy
pen
for
a
fresh
start
.
<EOS>
I
give
and
bequeath
 
did
thee
put
"
give
and
bequeath
,
"
at
th
'
beginning
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
"
said
William
,
looking
back
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Thee
didst
not
tell
me
"
give
and
bequeath
!
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
Then
it
wo
n't
be
legal
,
and
my
bit
o
'
furniture
'll
be
taken
to
London
,
and
put
into
chancery
,
and
Hester
will
have
noane
on
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
write
it
over
,
"
said
William
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
write
it
clear
then
,
and
put
a
line
under
it
to
show
those
are
my
special
words
.
<EOS>
Hast
thee
done
it
?
<EOS>
Then
now
start
afresh
.
<EOS>
I
give
and
bequeath
my
book
o
'
sermons
,
as
is
bound
in
good
calfskin
,
and
lies
on
the
third
shelf
o
'
corner
cupboard
at
the
right
hand
o
'
t
'
fire
-
place
,
to
Philip
Hepburn
;
for
I
reckon
he
's
as
fond
o
'
reading
sermons
as
thee
art
o
'
light
,
well
-
boiled
paste
,
and
I
'd
be
glad
for
each
on
ye
to
have
somewhat
ye
like
for
to
remember
me
by
.
<EOS>
Is
that
down
?
<EOS>
There
;
now
for
my
cousins
John
and
Jeremiah
.
<EOS>
They
are
rich
i
'
world
's
gear
,
but
they
'll
prize
what
I
leave
'em
if
I
could
only
onbethink
me
what
they
would
like
.
<EOS>
Hearken
!
<EOS>
Is
na
'
that
our
Hester
's
step
?
<EOS>
Put
it
away
,
quick
!
<EOS>
I
'm
noane
for
grieving
her
wi
'
telling
her
what
I
've
been
about
.
<EOS>
We
'll
take
a
turn
at
t
'
will
next
First
Day
;
it
will
serve
us
for
several
Sabbaths
to
come
,
and
maybe
I
can
think
on
something
as
will
suit
cousin
John
and
cousin
<EOS>
Jeremiah
afore
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hester
,
as
was
mentioned
,
paused
a
minute
or
two
before
lifting
the
latch
of
the
door
.
<EOS>
When
she
entered
there
was
no
unusual
sign
of
writing
about
;
only
Will
Coulson
looking
very
red
,
and
crushing
and
smelling
at
the
geranium
leaf
.
  
<EOS>
Hester
came
in
briskly
,
with
the
little
stock
of
enforced
cheerfulness
she
had
stopped
at
the
door
to
acquire
.
<EOS>
But
it
faded
away
along
with
the
faint
flush
of
colour
in
her
cheeks
;
and
the
mother
's
quick
eye
immediately
noted
the
wan
heavy
look
of
care
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
kept
t
'
pot
in
t
'
oven
;
it
'll
have
a'most
got
a
'
t
'
goodness
out
of
t
'
tea
by
now
,
for
it
'll
be
an
hour
since
I
made
it
.
<EOS>
Poor
lass
,
thou
look'st
<EOS>
as
if
thou
needed
a
good
cup
o
'
tea
.
<EOS>
It
were
dree
work
sitting
wi
'
Betsy
Darley
,
were
it
?
<EOS>
And
how
does
she
look
on
her
affliction
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
takes
it
sore
to
heart
,
"
said
Hester
,
taking
off
her
hat
,
and
folding
and
smoothing
away
her
cloak
,
before
putting
them
in
the
great
oak
chest
(
or
"
ark
,
"
as
it
was
called
)
,
in
which
they
were
laid
from
Sunday
to
Sunday
.
  
<EOS>
As
she
opened
the
lid
a
sweet
scent
of
dried
lavender
and
rose
-
leaves
came
out
.
<EOS>
William
stepped
hastily
forwards
to
hold
up
the
heavy
lid
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
lifted
up
her
head
,
looked
at
him
full
with
her
serene
eyes
,
and
thanked
him
for
his
little
service
.
<EOS>
Then
she
took
a
creepie
-
stool
and
sate
down
on
the
side
of
the
fire
-
place
,
having
her
back
to
the
window
.
  
<EOS>
The
hearth
was
of
the
same
spotless
whiteness
as
the
steps
;
all
that
was
black
about
the
grate
was
polished
to
the
utmost
extent
;
all
that
was
of
brass
,
like
the
handle
of
the
oven
,
was
burnished
bright
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
placed
the
little
black
earthenware
teapot
,
in
which
the
tea
had
been
stewing
,
on
the
table
,
where
cups
and
saucers
were
already
set
for
four
,
and
a
large
plate
of
bread
and
butter
cut
.
<EOS>
Then
they
sate
round
the
table
,
bowed
their
heads
,
and
kept
silence
for
a
minute
or
two
.
  
<EOS>
When
this
grace
was
ended
,
and
they
were
about
to
begin
,
Alice
said
,
as
if
without
premeditation
,
but
in
reality
with
a
keen
shrinking
of
heart
out
of
sympathy
with
her
child
    
<EOS>
"
Philip
would
have
been
in
to
his
tea
by
now
,
I
reckon
,
if
he
'd
been
coming
.
"
  
<EOS>
William
looked
up
suddenly
at
Hester
;
her
mother
carefully
turned
her
head
another
way
.
<EOS>
But
she
answered
quite
quietly
    
"
He
'll
be
gone
to
his
aunt
's
at
Haytersbank
.
<EOS>
I
met
him
at
t
'
top
o
'
t
'
Brow
,
with
his
cousin
and
Molly
Corney
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
deal
there
,
"
said
William
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Hester
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
likely
;
him
and
his
aunt
come
from
Carlisle
-
way
,
and
must
needs
cling
together
in
these
strange
parts
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
saw
him
at
the
burying
of
yon
Darley
,
"
said
William
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
were
<EOS>
a
vast
o
'
<EOS>
people
went
past
th
'
entry
end
,
"
said
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
It
were
a'most
like
election
time
;
I
were
just
come
back
fra
'
meeting
when
they
were
all
going
up
th
'
church
steps
.
<EOS>
I
met
yon
sailor
as
,
they
say
,
used
violence
and
did
murder
;
he
looked
like
a
ghost
,
though
whether
it
were
his
bodily
wounds
,
or
the
sense
of
his
sins
stirring
within
him
,
it
's
not
for
me
to
say
.
<EOS>
And
by
t
'
time
I
was
back
here
and
settled
to
my
Bible
,
t
'
folk
were
returning
,
and
it
were
tramp
,
tramp
,
<EOS>
past
th
'
entry
end
for
better
nor
<EOS>
a
quarter
of
an
hour

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
say
Kinraid
has
getten
slugs
and
gun
-
shot
in
his
side
,
"
said
Hester
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
niver
one
Charley
Kinraid
,
for
sure
,
as
I
knowed
at
Newcastle
,
"
said
William
Coulson
,
roused
to
sudden
and
energetic
curiosity
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
replied
Hester
;
"
they
call
him
just
Kinraid
;
and
Betsy
Darley
says
he
's
t
'
most
daring
specksioneer
of
all
that
go
off
this
coast
to
t
'
Greenland
seas
.
<EOS>
But
he
's
been
in
Newcastle
,
for
I
mind
me
<EOS>
she
said
her
poor
brother
met
with
him
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
didst
thee
come
to
know
him
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
abide
him
if
it
is
Charley
,
"
said
William
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
kept
company
with
my
poor
sister
as
is
dead
for
better
nor
two
year
,
and
then
he
left
off
coming
to
see
her
and
went
wi
'
another
girl
,
and
it
just
broke
her
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
do
n't
look
now
as
if
he
iver
could
play
at
that
game
again
,
"
said
Alice
;
"
he
has
had
a
warning
fra
'
the
Lord
.
<EOS>
Whether
it
be
a
call
no
one
can
tell
.
<EOS>
But
to
my
eyne
he
looks
as
if
he
had
been
called
,
and
was
going
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
he
'll
meet
my
sister
,
"
said
William
,
solemnly
;
"
and
I
hope
the
Lord
will
make
it
clear
to
him
<EOS>
,
then
,
how
he
killed
her
,
as
sure
as
he
shot
down
yon
sailors
;
an
'
if
there
's
a
gnashing
o
'
teeth
for
murder
<EOS>
i
'
<EOS>
that
other
place
,
I
reckon
he
'll
have
his
share
on't
.
<EOS>
He
's
a
bad
man
yon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Betsy
said
he
were
such
a
friend
to
her
brother
as
niver
was
;
and
he
's
sent
her
word
and
promised
to
go
and
see
her
,
first
place
he
goes
out
to
.
  
<EOS>
But
William
only
shook
his
head
,
and
repeated
his
last
words
,
    
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
bad
man
,
he
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
When
Philip
came
home
that
Sunday
night
,
he
found
only
Alice
up
to
receive
him
.
<EOS>
The
usual
bedtime
in
the
household
was
nine
o'clock
,
and
it
was
but
<EOS>
ten
minutes
past
the
hour
;
but
Alice
looked
displeased
and
stern
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thee
art
late
,
lad
,
"
said
she
,
shortly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sorry
;
it
's
a
long
way
from
my
uncle
's
,
and
I
think
clocks
are
different
,
"
said
he
,
taking
out
his
watch
to
compare
it
with
the
round
moon
's
face
that
told
the
time
to
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
nought
about
thy
uncle
's
,
but
thee
art
late
.
<EOS>
Take
thy
candle
,
and
begone
.
"
  
<EOS>
If
Alice
made
any
reply
to
Philip
's
"
good
-
night
,
"
he
did
not
hear
it
.
    
<EOS>
ATTRACTION
AND
REPULSION
  
<EOS>
A
fortnight
had
passed
over
and
winter
was
advancing
with
rapid
strides
.
<EOS>
In
bleak
northern
farmsteads
there
was
much
to
be
done
before
November
weather
should
make
the
roads
too
heavy
for
half
-
fed
horses
to
pull
carts
through
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
turf
,
pared
up
on
the
distant
moors
,
and
left
out
to
dry
,
to
be
carried
home
and
stacked
;
the
brown
fern
was
to
be
stored
up
for
winter
bedding
for
the
cattle
;
for
straw
was
scarce
and
dear
in
those
parts
;
even
for
thatching
,
heather
(
or
rather
ling
)
was
used
.
<EOS>
Then
there
was
meat
to
salt
while
it
could
be
had
;
for
,
in
default
of
turnips
and
mangold
-
wurzel
,
there
was
a
great
slaughtering
of
barren
cows
as
soon
as
the
summer
herbage
failed
;
and
good
housewives
stored
up
their
Christmas
piece
of
beef
in
pickle
before
Martinmas
was
over
.
<EOS>
Corn
was
to
be
ground
while
yet
it
could
be
carried
to
the
distant
mill
;
the
great
racks
for
oat
-
cake
,
that
swung
at
the
top
of
the
kitchen
,
had
to
be
filled
.
<EOS>
And
last
of
all
came
the
pig
-
killing
,
when
the
second
frost
set
in
.
<EOS>
For
up
in
the
north
there
is
an
idea
that
the
ice
stored
in
the
first
frost
will
melt
,
and
the
meat
cured
then
taint
;
the
first
frost
is
good
for
nothing
but
to
be
thrown
away
,
as
they
express
it
.
  
<EOS>
There
came
a
breathing
-
time
after
this
last
event
.
<EOS>
The
house
had
had
its
last
autumn
cleaning
,
and
was
neat
and
bright
from
top
to
bottom
,
from
one
end
to
another
.
<EOS>
The
turf
was
led
;
the
coal
carted
up
from
Monkshaven
;
the
wood
stored
;
the
corn
ground
;
the
pig
killed
,
and
the
hams
and
head
and
hands
lying
in
salt
.
<EOS>
The
butcher
had
been
glad
to
take
the
best
parts
of
a
pig
of
Dame
Robson
's
careful
feeding
;
but
there
was
unusual
plenty
in
the
Haytersbank
pantry
;
and
as
Bell
surveyed
it
one
morning
,
she
said
to
her
husband
    
"
I
wonder
if
yon
poor
sick
chap
at
Moss
Brow
would
fancy
some
o
'
my
sausages
.
<EOS>
They
're
something
to
crack
on
,
for
they
are
made
fra
'
an
old
Cumberland
receipt
,
as
is
not
known
<EOS>
i
'
Yorkshire
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Thou
's
allays
so
set
upo
'
Cumberland
ways
!
"
said
her
husband
,
not
displeased
with
the
suggestion
,
however
.
<EOS>
"
Still
,
when
folk
's
sick
they
han
their
fancies
,
and
maybe
Kinraid
'll
be
glad
o
'
thy
sausages
.
<EOS>
I
ha
'
known
sick
folk
tak
'
t
'
eating
snails
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
not
complimentary
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
But
Daniel
went
on
to
say
that
he
did
not
mind
if
he
stepped
over
with
the
sausages
himself
,
when
it
was
too
late
to
do
anything
else
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
longed
to
offer
to
accompany
her
father
;
but
,
somehow
,
she
did
not
like
to
propose
it
.
<EOS>
Towards
dusk
she
came
to
her
mother
to
ask
for
the
key
of
the
great
bureau
that
stood
in
the
house
-
place
as
a
state
piece
of
furniture
,
although
its
use
was
to
contain
the
family
's
best
wearing
apparel
,
and
stores
of
linen
,
such
as
might
be
supposed
to
be
more
needed
upstairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
for
do
yo
'
want
my
keys
?
"
asked
Bell
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
just
to
get
out
one
of
t
'
damask
napkins
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
The
best
napkins
,
as
my
mother
span
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
!
"
said
Sylvia
,
her
colour
heightening
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
as
how
it
would
set
off
t
'
sausages
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
good
clean
homespun
cloth
will
serve
them
better
,
"
said
Bell
,
wondering
in
her
own
mind
what
was
come
over
the
girl
,
to
be
thinking
of
setting
off
sausages
that
were
to
be
eaten
,
not
to
be
looked
at
like
a
picture
-
book
.
<EOS>
She
might
have
wondered
still
more
,
if
she
had
seen
Sylvia
steal
round
to
the
little
flower
border
she
had
persuaded
Kester
to
make
under
the
wall
at
the
sunny
side
of
the
house
,
and
gather
the
two
or
three
Michaelmas
daisies
,
and
the
one
bud
of
the
China
rose
,
that
,
growing
against
the
kitchen
chimney
,
had
escaped
the
frost
;
and
then
,
when
her
mother
was
not
looking
,
softly
open
the
cloth
inside
of
the
little
basket
that
contained
the
sausages
and
a
fresh
egg
or
two
,
and
lay
her
autumn
blossoms
in
one
of
the
folds
of
the
towel
.
  
<EOS>
After
Daniel
,
now
pretty
clear
of
his
rheumatism
,
had
had
his
afternoon
meal
<EOS>
(
tea
was
a
Sunday
treat
)
,
he
prepared
to
set
out
on
his
walk
to
Moss
Brow
;
but
as
he
was
taking
his
stick
he
caught
the
look
on
Sylvia
's
face
;
and
unconsciously
interpreted
its
dumb
wistfulness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Missus
,
"
said
he
,
<EOS>
"
t
'
wench
has
nought
more
t
'
do
,
has
she
?
<EOS>
She
may
as
well
put
on
her
cloak
and
step
down
wi
'
me
,
and
see
Molly
a
bit
;
she
'll
be
company
like
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bell
considered
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
t
'
yarn
for
thy
stockings
as
is
yet
to
spin
;
but
she
can
go
,
for
I
'll
do
a
bit
at
'
t
mysel
'
,
and
there
's
nought
else
agate
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Put
on
thy
things
in
a
jiffy
,
then
,
and
let
's
be
off
,
"
said
Daniel
.
  
<EOS>
And
Sylvia
did
not
need
another
word
.
<EOS>
Down
she
came
in
a
twinkling
,
dressed
in
her
new
red
cloak
and
hood
,
her
face
peeping
out
of
the
folds
of
the
latter
,
bright
and
blushing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thou
should'st
na
'
ha
'
put
on
thy
new
cloak
for
a
night
walk
to
Moss
Brow
,
"
said
Bell
,
shaking
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
go
take
it
off
,
and
put
on
my
shawl
?
"
asked
Sylvia
,
a
little
dolefully
.
  
<EOS>
"
Na
,
na
,
come
along
!
<EOS>
a'm
noane
goin'
for
t
'
wait
<EOS>
o
'
women
's
chops
and
changes
.
<EOS>
Come
along
;
come
,
Lassie
!
"
<EOS>
(
this
last
to
his
dog
)
.
  
<EOS>
So
Sylvia
set
off
with
a
dancing
heart
and
a
dancing
step
,
that
had
to
be
restrained
to
the
sober
gait
her
father
chose
.
<EOS>
The
sky
above
was
bright
and
clear
with
the
light
of
a
thousand
stars
,
the
grass
was
crisping
under
their
feet
with
the
coming
hoar
frost
;
and
as
they
mounted
to
the
higher
ground
they
could
see
the
dark
sea
stretching
away
far
below
them
.
<EOS>
The
night
was
very
still
,
though
now
<EOS>
and
then
crisp
sounds
in
the
distant
air
sounded
very
near
in
the
silence
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
carried
the
basket
,
and
looked
like
little
Red
Riding
Hood
.
<EOS>
Her
father
had
nothing
to
say
,
and
did
not
care
to
make
himself
agreeable
;
but
Sylvia
enjoyed
her
own
thoughts
,
and
any
conversation
would
have
been
a
disturbance
to
her
.
<EOS>
The
long
monotonous
roll
of
the
distant
waves
,
as
the
tide
bore
them
in
,
the
multitudinous
rush
at
last
,
and
then
the
retreating
rattle
and
trickle
,
as
the
baffled
waters
fell
back
over
the
shingle
that
skirted
the
sands
,
and
divided
them
from
the
cliffs
;
her
father
's
measured
tread
,
and
slow
,
even
movement
;
Lassie
's
pattering
 
all
lulled
Sylvia
into
a
reverie
,
of
which
she
could
not
have
given
herself
any
definite
account
.
<EOS>
But
at
length
they
arrived
at
Moss
Brow
,
and
with
a
sudden
sigh
she
quitted
the
subjects
of
her
dreamy
meditations
,
and
followed
her
father
into
the
great
house
-
place
.
<EOS>
It
had
a
more
comfortable
aspect
by
night
than
by
day
.
<EOS>
The
fire
was
always
kept
up
to
a
wasteful
size
,
and
the
dancing
blaze
and
the
partial
light
of
candles
left
much
in
shadow
that
was
best
ignored
in
such
a
disorderly
family
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
always
a
warm
welcome
to
friends
,
however
roughly
given
;
and
after
the
words
of
this
were
spoken
,
the
next
rose
up
equally
naturally
in
the
mind
of
Mrs
Corney
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
will
ye
tak
'
?
<EOS>
Eh
!
<EOS>
but
t
'
measter
'll
be
fine
and
vexed
at
your
comin
'
when
he
's
away
.
<EOS>
He
's
off
to
Horncastle
t
'
sell
some
colts
,
and
he
'll
not
be
back
till
to
-
morrow
's
neet
.
<EOS>
But
here
's
Charley
Kinraid
as
we
've
getten
to
nurse
up
a
bit
,
and
'
t
'
lads
'll
be
back
fra
'
<EOS>
Monkshaven
in
a
crack
o
'
no
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
All
this
was
addressed
to
Daniel
,
to
whom
she
knew
that
none
but
masculine
company
would
be
acceptable
.
<EOS>
Amongst
uneducated
people
 
whose
range
of
subjects
and
interest
do
not
extend
beyond
their
daily
life
 
it
is
natural
that
when
the
first
blush
and
hurry
of
youth
is
over
,
there
should
be
no
great
pleasure
in
the
conversation
of
the
other
sex
.
<EOS>
Men
have
plenty
to
say
to
men
,
which
in
their
estimation
(
gained
from
tradition
and
experience
)
<EOS>
women
can
not
understand
;
and
farmers
of
a
much
later
date
than
the
one
of
which
I
am
writing
,
would
have
contemptuously
considered
it
as
a
loss
of
time
to
talk
to
women
;
indeed
,
they
were
often
more
communicative
to
the
sheep
-
dog
that
accompanied
them
through
all
the
day
's
work
,
and
frequently
became
a
sort
of
dumb
confidant
.
<EOS>
Farmer
Robson
's
Lassie
now
lay
down
at
her
master
's
feet
,
placed
her
nose
between
her
paws
,
and
watched
with
attentive
eyes
the
preparations
going
on
for
refreshments
 
preparations
which
,
to
the
disappointment
of
her
canine
heart
,
consisted
entirely
of
tumblers
and
sugar
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
's
t
'
wench
?
"
said
Robson
,
after
he
had
shaken
hands
with
Kinraid
,
and
spoken
a
few
words
to
him
and
to
Mrs.
Corney
.
<EOS>
"
She
's
getten
'
a
basket
wi
'
sausages
in
'em
,
as
my
missus
has
made
,
and
she
's
a
rare
hand
at
sausages
;
there
's
noane
like
her
in
a
'
t
'
three
Ridings
,
I
'll
be
bound
!
"
  
<EOS>
For
Daniel
could
praise
his
wife
's
powers
in
her
absence
,
though
he
did
not
often
express
himself
in
an
appreciative
manner
when
she
was
by
to
hear
.
<EOS>
But
Sylvia
's
quick
sense
caught
up
the
manner
in
which
Mrs.
Corney
would
apply
the
way
in
which
her
mother
's
housewifery
had
been
exalted
,
and
stepping
forwards
out
of
the
shadow
,
she
said
,
    
"
Mother
thought
,
maybe
,
you
had
n't
killed
a
pig
yet
,
and
sausages
is
always
a
bit
savoury
for
any
one
who
is
na
'
<EOS>
well
,
and
   
'
  
<EOS>
She
might
have
gone
on
but
that
she
caught
Kinraid
's
eyes
looking
at
her
with
kindly
admiration
.
<EOS>
She
stopped
speaking
,
and
Mrs.
Corney
took
up
the
word
    
"
<EOS>
As
for
sausages
,
I
ha
'
niver
had
a
chance
this
year
,
else
I
stand
again
any
one
for
t
'
making
of
'em
.
<EOS>
Yorkshire
hams
's
a
vast
thought
on
,
and
I
'll
niver
let
another
county
woman
say
as
she
can
make
better
sausages
nor
me
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
I
'm
saying
,
I
'd
niver
a
chance
;
for
our
pig
,
as
I
were
sa
fond
on
,
and
fed
mysel
'
,
and
as
would
ha
'
been
fourteen
stone
by
now
if
he
were
an
ounce
,
and
as
knew
me
as
well
as
any
Christian
,
and
a
pig
,
as
I
may
say
,
that
I
just
idolized
,
went
and
took
a
fit
a
week
after
Michaelmas
Day
,
and
died
,
as
if
it
had
been
to
spite
me
;
and
t
'
next
is
na
'
ready
for
killing
,
nor
wunnot
be
this
six
week
.
<EOS>
So
I
'm
much
beholden
to
your
missus
,
and
<EOS>
so
's
Charley
,
I
'm
sure
;
though
he
's
ta'en
a
turn
to
betterin
'
sin
<EOS>
'
he
came
out
here
to
be
nursed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
deal
better
,
"
said
Kinraid
;
"
a'most
ready
for
t
'
press
-
gang
to
give
chase
to
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
folk
say
they
're
gone
off
this
coast
for
one
while
,
"
added
Daniel
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
're
gone
down
towards
Hull
,
as
I
've
been
told
,
"
said
Kinraid
.
<EOS>
"
But
they
're
a
deep
set
,
they
'll
be
here
before
we
know
where
we
are
,
some
of
these
days
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
See
thee
here
!
"
said
Daniel
,
exhibiting
his
maimed
hand
;
"
a
reckon
a
served
'em
out
<EOS>
time
<EOS>
o
'
t
'
Ameriky
war
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
he
began
the
story
Sylvia
knew
so
well
;
for
her
father
never
made
a
new
acquaintance
but
what
he
told
him
of
his
self
-
mutilation
to
escape
the
press
-
gang
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
done
,
as
he
would
himself
have
owned
,
to
spite
himself
as
well
as
them
;
for
it
had
obliged
him
to
leave
a
sea
-
life
,
to
which
,
in
comparison
,
all
life
spent
on
shore
was
worse
than
nothing
for
dulness
.
<EOS>
For
Robson
had
never
reached
that
rank
aboard
ship
which
made
his
being
unable
to
run
up
the
rigging
,
or
to
throw
a
harpoon
,
or
to
fire
off
a
gun
,
of
no
great
consequence
;
so
he
had
to
be
thankful
that
an
opportune
legacy
enabled
him
to
turn
farmer
,
a
great
degradation
in
his
opinion
.
<EOS>
But
his
blood
warmed
,
as
he
told
the
specksioneer
,
towards
a
sailor
,
and
he
pressed
Kinraid
to
beguile
the
time
when
he
was
compelled
to
be
ashore
,
by
coming
over
to
see
him
at
Haytersbank
,
whenever
he
felt
inclined
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
,
appearing
to
listen
to
Molly
's
confidences
,
was
hearkening
in
reality
to
all
this
conversation
between
her
father
and
the
specksioneer
;
and
at
this
invitation
she
became
especially
attentive
.
  
<EOS>
Kinraid
replied
,
    
"
I
'm
much
obliged
to
ye
,
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
;
maybe
I
can
come
and
spend
an
ev'ning
wi
'
you
;
but
as
soon
as
I
'm
got
round
a
bit
,
I
must
go
see
my
own
people
as
live
at
Cullercoats
near
Newcastle
-
upo
'
 
Tyne
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
!
"
said
Daniel
,
rising
to
take
leave
,
with
unusual
prudence
as
to
the
amount
of
his
drink
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Thou'lt
see
<EOS>
,
thou'lt
see
!
<EOS>
I
shall
be
main
glad
to
see
thee
;
if
thou'lt
come
.
<EOS>
But
I
've
na
'
lads
to
keep
thee
company
,
only
one
sprig
of
a
wench
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
,
come
here
,
an
let
's
show
thee
to
this
young
fellow
!
"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
came
forwards
,
ruddy
as
any
rose
,
and
in
a
moment
Kinraid
recognized
her
as
the
pretty
little
girl
he
had
seen
crying
so
bitterly
over
Darley
's
grave
.
<EOS>
He
rose
up
out
of
true
sailor
's
gallantry
,
as
she
shyly
approached
and
stood
by
her
father
's
side
,
scarcely
daring
to
lift
her
great
soft
eyes
,
to
have
one
fair
gaze
at
his
face
.
<EOS>
He
had
to
support
himself
by
one
hand
rested
on
the
dresser
,
but
she
saw
he
was
looking
far
better
 
<EOS>
younger
,
less
haggard
 
than
he
had
seemed
to
her
before
.
<EOS>
His
face
was
short
and
expressive
;
his
complexion
had
been
weatherbeaten
and
bronzed
,
though
now
he
looked
so
pale
;
his
eyes
and
hair
were
dark
,
 
<EOS>
the
former
quick
,
deep
-
set
,
and
penetrating
;
the
latter
curly
,
and
almost
in
ringlets
.
<EOS>
His
teeth
gleamed
white
as
he
smiled
at
her
,
a
pleasant
friendly
smile
of
recognition
;
but
she
only
blushed
the
deeper
,
and
hung
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
come
,
sir
,
and
be
thankful
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
a
turn'll
do
me
good
,
if
the
weather
holds
up
,
an
'
th
'
frost
keeps
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
right
,
my
lad
,
"
said
Robson
,
shaking
him
by
the
hand
,
and
then
Kinraid
's
hand
was
held
out
to
Sylvia
,
and
she
could
not
avoid
the
same
friendly
action
.
  
<EOS>
Molly
Corney
followed
her
to
the
door
,
and
when
they
were
fairly
outside
,
she
held
Sylvia
back
for
an
instant
to
say
,
    
"
Is
na
'
<EOS>
he
a
fine
likely
man
?
<EOS>
I
'm
so
glad
as
yo've
seen
him
,
for
he
's
to
be
off
next
week
to
Newcastle
and
that
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
said
he
'd
come
to
us
some
night
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Sylvia
,
half
in
a
fright
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
I
'll
see
as
he
does
;
never
fear
.
<EOS>
For
I
should
like
yo
'
<EOS>
for
to
know
him
a
bit
.
<EOS>
He
's
a
rare
talker
.
<EOS>
I
'll
mind
him
o
'
coming
to
yo
'
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Somehow
,
Sylvia
felt
as
if
this
repeated
promise
of
reminding
Kinraid
of
his
promise
to
come
and
see
her
father
took
away
part
of
the
pleasure
she
had
anticipated
from
his
visit
.
<EOS>
Yet
what
could
be
more
natural
than
that
Molly
Corney
should
wish
her
friend
to
be
acquainted
with
the
man
whom
Sylvia
believed
to
be
all
but
Molly
's
engaged
lover
?
  
<EOS>
Pondering
these
thoughts
,
the
walk
home
was
as
silent
as
that
going
to
Moss
Brow
had
been
.
<EOS>
The
only
change
seemed
to
be
that
now
they
faced
the
brilliant
northern
lights
flashing
up
the
sky
,
and
that
either
this
appearance
or
some
of
the
whaling
narrations
of
Kinraid
had
stirred
up
Daniel
Robson
's
recollections
of
a
sea
ditty
,
which
he
kept
singing
to
himself
in
a
low
,
unmusical
voice
,
the
burden
of
which
was
,
"
<EOS>
for
I
loves
the
tossin
'
say
!
<EOS>
"
Bell
met
them
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
and
here
ye
are
at
home
again
!
<EOS>
and
Philip
has
been
,
Sylvie
,
to
give
thee
thy
ciphering
lesson
;
and
he
stayed
awhile
,
thinking
thou'd
be
coming
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
very
sorry
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
more
out
of
deference
to
her
mother
's
tone
of
annoyance
,
than
because
she
herself
cared
either
for
her
lesson
or
her
cousin
's
disappointment
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
'll
come
again
to
-
morrow
night
,
he
says
.
<EOS>
But
thou
must
take
care
,
and
mind
the
nights
he
says
he
'll
come
,
<EOS>
for
it
's
a
long
way
to
come
for
nought
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
might
have
repeated
her
"
I
'm
very
sorry
'
at
this
announcement
of
Philip
's
intentions
;
but
she
restrained
herself
,
inwardly
and
fervently
hoping
that
Molly
would
not
urge
the
fulfilment
of
the
specksioneer
's
promise
for
to
-
morrow
night
,
for
Philip
's
being
there
would
spoil
all
;
and
besides
,
if
she
sate
at
the
dresser
at
her
lesson
,
and
Kinraid
at
the
table
with
her
father
,
he
might
hear
all
,
and
find
out
what
a
dunce
she
was
.
  
<EOS>
She
need
not
have
been
afraid
.
<EOS>
With
the
next
night
Hepburn
came
;
and
Kinraid
did
not
.
<EOS>
After
a
few
words
to
her
mother
,
Philip
produced
the
candles
he
had
promised
,
and
some
books
and
a
quill
or
two
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
for
hast
thou
brought
candles
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Bell
,
in
a
half
-
affronted
tone
.
  
<EOS>
Hepburn
smiled
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sylvia
thought
it
would
take
a
deal
of
candlelight
,
and
was
for
making
it
into
a
reason
not
to
learn
.
<EOS>
I
should
ha
'
used
t
'
candles
if
I
'd
stayed
at
home
,
so
I
just
brought
them
wi
'
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
thou
may'st
just
take
them
back
again
,
"
said
Bell
,
shortly
,
blowing
out
that
which
he
had
lighted
,
and
placing
one
of
her
own
on
the
dresser
instead
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
caught
her
mother
's
look
of
displeasure
,
and
it
made
her
docile
for
the
evening
,
although
she
owed
her
cousin
a
grudge
for
her
enforced
good
behaviour
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Sylvia
,
here
's
a
copy
-
book
wi
'
<EOS>
t
'
Tower
o
'
London
on
it
,
and
we
'll
fill
it
wi
'
as
pretty
writing
as
any
in
t
'
North
Riding
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
sate
quite
still
,
unenlivened
by
this
prospect
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
's
a
pen
as
'll
nearly
write
of
itsel
'
,
"
continued
Philip
,
still
trying
to
coax
her
out
her
sullenness
of
manner
.
  
<EOS>
Then
he
arranged
her
in
the
right
position
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
lay
your
head
down
on
your
left
arm
,
you
'll
ne'er
see
to
write
straight
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
attitude
was
changed
,
but
not
a
word
was
spoken
.
<EOS>
Philip
began
to
grow
angry
at
such
determined
dumbness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
tired
?
"
<EOS>
asked
he
,
with
a
strange
mixture
of
crossness
and
tenderness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
very
,
"
was
her
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
thou
ought'st
not
to
be
tired
,
"
said
Bell
,
who
had
not
yet
got
over
the
offence
to
her
hospitality
;
who
,
moreover
,
liked
her
nephew
,
and
had
,
to
boot
,
a
great
respect
for
the
learning
she
had
never
acquired
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
!
"
said
Sylvia
,
bursting
out
,
"
what
's
the
use
on
my
writing
"
Abednego
,
"
"
Abednego
,
"
"
Abednego
,
"
all
down
a
page
?
<EOS>
If
I
could
see
t
'
use
on
'
t
,
I
'd
ha
'
axed
father
to
send
me
t
'
school
;
but
I
'm
none
wanting
to
have
learning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
fine
thing
,
tho
'
,
is
learning
.
<EOS>
My
mother
and
my
grandmother
had
it
:
but
th
'
family
came
down
i
'
the
world
,
and
Philip
's
mother
and
me
,
we
had
none
of
it
;
but
I
ha
'
set
my
heart
on
thy
having
it
,
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
fingers
is
stiff
,
"
pleaded
Sylvia
,
holding
up
her
little
hand
and
shaking
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
take
a
turn
at
spelling
,
then
,
"
said
Philip
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
t
'
use
on't
?
"
asked
captious
Sylvia
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
it
helps
one
<EOS>
i
'
reading
an
'
writing
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
what
does
reading
and
writing
do
for
one
?
"
  
<EOS>
Her
mother
gave
her
another
of
the
severe
looks
that
,
quiet
woman
as
she
was
,
she
could
occasionally
bestow
upon
the
refractory
,
and
Sylvia
took
her
book
and
glanced
down
the
column
Philip
pointed
out
to
her
;
but
,
as
she
justly
considered
,
one
man
might
point
out
the
task
,
but
twenty
could
not
make
her
learn
it
,
if
she
did
not
choose
;
and
she
sat
herself
down
on
the
edge
of
the
dresser
,
and
idly
gazed
into
the
fire
.
<EOS>
But
her
mother
came
round
to
look
for
something
in
the
drawers
of
the
dresser
,
and
as
she
passed
her
daughter
she
said
in
a
low
voice
    
"
Sylvie
,
be
a
good
lass
.
<EOS>
I
set
a
deal
o
'
store
by
learning
,
and
father
'
ud
never
send
thee
to
school
,
as
has
stuck
by
me
sore
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
If
Philip
,
sitting
with
his
back
to
them
,
heard
these
words
he
was
discreet
enough
not
to
show
that
he
heard
.
<EOS>
And
he
had
his
reward
;
for
in
a
very
short
time
,
Sylvia
stood
before
him
with
her
book
in
her
hand
,
prepared
to
say
her
spelling
.
<EOS>
At
which
he
also
stood
up
by
instinct
,
and
listened
to
her
slow
succeeding
letters
;
helping
her
out
,
when
she
looked
up
at
him
with
a
sweet
childlike
perplexity
in
her
face
:
for
a
dunce
as
to
book
-
learning
<EOS>
poor
Sylvia
was
and
was
likely
to
remain
;
and
,
in
spite
of
his
assumed
office
of
schoolmaster
,
Philip
Hepburn
could
almost
have
echoed
the
words
of
the
lover
of
Jess
MacFarlane
      
<EOS>
I
sent
my
love
a
letter
,
  
<EOS>
But
,
alas
!
<EOS>
she
canna
read
,
  
<EOS>
And
I
lo'e
her
<EOS>
a
'
the
better
.
  
<EOS>
Still
he
knew
his
aunt
's
strong
wish
on
the
subject
,
and
it
was
very
delightful
to
stand
in
the
relation
of
teacher
to
<EOS>
so
dear
and
pretty
,
if
so
wilful
,
a
pupil
.
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
was
not
very
flattering
to
notice
Sylvia
's
great
joy
when
her
lessons
were
over
,
sadly
shortened
as
they
were
by
Philip
's
desire
not
to
be
too
hard
upon
her
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
danced
round
to
her
mother
,
bent
her
head
back
,
and
kissed
her
face
,
and
then
said
defyingly
to
Philip
,
    
"
<EOS>
If
iver
<EOS>
I
write
thee
a
letter
it
shall
just
be
full
of
nothing
but
"
Abednego
!
<EOS>
Abednego
!
<EOS>
Abednego
!
"
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
at
this
moment
her
father
came
in
from
a
distant
expedition
on
the
moors
with
Kester
to
look
after
the
sheep
he
had
pasturing
there
before
the
winter
set
fairly
in
.
<EOS>
He
was
tired
,
and
so
was
Lassie
,
and
so
,
too
,
was
Kester
,
who
,
lifting
his
heavy
legs
one
after
the
other
,
and
smoothing
down
his
hair
,
followed
his
master
into
the
house
-
place
,
and
seating
himself
on
a
bench
at
the
farther
end
of
the
dresser
,
patiently
awaited
the
supper
of
porridge
and
milk
which
he
shared
with
his
master
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
,
meanwhile
,
coaxed
Lassie
 
poor
footsore
dog
 
to
her
side
,
and
gave
her
some
food
,
which
the
creature
was
almost
too
tired
to
eat
.
<EOS>
Philip
made
as
though
he
would
be
going
,
but
Daniel
motioned
to
him
to
be
quiet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sit
thee
down
,
lad
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
I
've
had
my
victual
,
I
want
t
'
hear
a
bit
o
'
news
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
took
her
sewing
and
sat
at
the
little
round
table
by
her
mother
,
sharing
the
light
of
the
scanty
dip
-
candle
.
<EOS>
No
one
spoke
.
<EOS>
Every
one
was
absorbed
in
what
they
were
doing
.
<EOS>
What
Philip
was
doing
was
,
gazing
at
Sylvia
 
learning
her
face
off
by
heart
.
  
<EOS>
When
every
scrap
of
porridge
was
cleared
out
of
the
mighty
bowl
,
Kester
yawned
,
and
wishing
good
-
night
,
withdrew
to
his
loft
over
the
cow
-
house
.
<EOS>
Then
Philip
pulled
out
the
weekly
York
paper
,
and
began
to
read
the
latest
accounts
of
the
war
then
raging
.
<EOS>
This
was
giving
Daniel
one
of
his
greatest
pleasures
;
for
though
he
could
read
pretty
well
,
yet
the
double
effort
of
reading
and
understanding
what
he
read
was
almost
too
much
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
could
read
,
or
he
could
understand
what
was
read
aloud
to
him
;
reading
was
no
pleasure
,
but
listening
was
.
  
<EOS>
Besides
,
he
had
a
true
John
Bullish
interest
in
the
war
,
without
very
well
knowing
what
the
English
were
fighting
for
.
<EOS>
But
in
those
days
,
so
long
as
they
fought
the
French
for
any
cause
,
or
for
no
cause
at
all
,
every
true
patriot
was
satisfied
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
and
her
mother
did
not
care
for
any
such
far
-
extended
interest
;
a
little
bit
of
York
news
,
the
stealing
of
a
few
apples
out
of
a
Scarborough
garden
that
they
knew
,
was
of
far
more
interest
to
them
than
all
the
battles
of
Nelson
and
the
North
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
read
in
a
high
-
pitched
and
unnatural
tone
of
voice
,
which
deprived
the
words
of
their
reality
;
for
even
familiar
expressions
can
become
unfamiliar
and
convey
no
ideas
,
if
the
utterance
is
forced
or
affected
.
<EOS>
Philip
was
somewhat
of
a
pedant
;
yet
there
was
a
simplicity
in
his
pedantry
not
always
to
be
met
with
in
those
who
are
self
-
taught
,
and
which
might
have
interested
any
one
who
cared
to
know
with
what
labour
and
difficulty
he
had
acquired
the
knowledge
which
now
he
prized
so
highly
;
reading
out
Latin
quotations
as
easily
as
if
they
were
English
,
and
taking
a
pleasure
in
rolling
polysyllables
,
until
all
at
once
looking
askance
at
Sylvia
,
he
saw
that
her
head
had
fallen
back
,
her
pretty
rosy
lips
open
,
her
eyes
fast
shut
;
in
short
,
she
was
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
"
said
Farmer
Robson
,
"
and
t
'
reading
has
a'most
sent
me
off
.
<EOS>
Mother
'd
look
angry
now
if
I
was
to
tell
yo
'
yo
'
had
a
right
to
a
kiss
;
but
when
I
was
a
young
man
I
'd
ha
'
kissed
a
pretty
girl
as
I
saw
asleep
,
afore
yo'd
said
Jack
Robson
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
trembled
at
these
words
,
and
looked
at
his
aunt
.
<EOS>
She
gave
him
no
encouragement
,
standing
up
,
and
making
as
though
she
had
never
heard
her
husband
's
speech
,
by
extending
her
hand
,
and
wishing
him
"
good
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
At
the
noise
of
the
chairs
moving
over
the
flag
floor
,
Sylvia
started
up
,
confused
and
annoyed
at
her
father
's
laughter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
lass
<EOS>
;
it
's
iver
a
good
time
<EOS>
t
'
fall
asleep
when
a
young
fellow
is
by

<EOS>
Here
's
Philip
here
as
thou'rt
bound
t
'
<EOS>
give
a
pair
o
'
gloves
to
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
went
like
fire
;
she
turned
to
her
mother
to
read
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
only
father
's
joke
,
lass
,
"
said
she
.
"
<EOS>
Philip
knows
manners
too
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
'd
better
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
flaming
round
at
him
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
'd
a
touched
me
,
I
'd
niver
ha
'
spoken
to
him
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
And
she
looked
even
as
it
was
as
if
she
was
far
from
forgiving
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hoots
,
lass
!
<EOS>
wenches

brought
up

now

i

<EOS>
my

such
great
harm
of
a
kiss
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Good
-
night
,
Philip
,
"
said
Bell
Robson
,
thinking
the
conversation
unseemly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
night
,
aunt
,
good
-
night
,
Sylvie
!
"
<EOS>
But
Sylvia
turned
her
back
on
him
,
and
he
could
hardly
say
"
good
-
night
"
to
Daniel
,
who
had
caused
such
an
unpleasant
end
to
an
evening
that
had
at
one
time
been
going
on
so
well
.
    
<EOS>
THE
SPECKSIONEER
  
<EOS>
A
few
days
after
,
Farmer
Robson
left
Haytersbank
betimes
on
a
longish
day
's
journey
,
to
purchase
a
horse
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
and
her
mother
were
busied
with
a
hundred
household
things
,
and
the
early
winter
's
evening
closed
in
upon
them
almost
before
they
were
aware
.
<EOS>
The
consequences
of
darkness
in
the
country
even
now
are
to
gather
the
members
of
a
family
together
into
one
room
,
and
to
make
them
settle
to
some
sedentary
employment
;
and
it
was
much
more
the
case
at
the
period
of
my
story
,
when
candles
were
far
dearer
than
they
are
at
present
,
and
when
one
was
often
made
to
suffice
for
a
large
family
.
  
<EOS>
The
mother
and
daughter
hardly
spoke
at
all
when
they
sat
down
at
last
.
<EOS>
The
cheerful
click
of
the
knitting
-
needles
made
a
pleasant
home
-
sound
;
and
in
the
occasional
snatches
of
slumber
that
overcame
her
mother
,
Sylvia
could
hear
the
long
-
rushing
boom
of
the
waves
,
down
below
the
rocks
,
for
the
Haytersbank
gulley
allowed
the
sullen
roar
to
come
up
so
far
inland
.
<EOS>
It
might
have
been
about
eight
o'clock
 
though
from
the
monotonous
course
of
the
evening
<EOS>
it
seemed
much
later
 
when
Sylvia
heard
her
father
's
heavy
step
cranching
down
the
pebbly
path
.
<EOS>
More
unusual
,
she
heard
his
voice
talking
to
some
companion
.
  
<EOS>
Curious
to
see
who
it
could
be
,
with
a
lively
instinctive
advance
towards
any
event
which
might
break
the
monotony
she
had
begun
to
find
somewhat
dull
,
she
sprang
up
to
open
the
door
.
<EOS>
Half
a
glance
into
the
gray
darkness
outside
made
her
suddenly
timid
,
and
she
drew
back
behind
the
door
as
she
opened
it
wide
to
admit
her
father
and
Kinraid
.
  
<EOS>
Daniel
Robson
came
in
bright
and
boisterous
.
<EOS>
He
was
pleased
with
his
purchase
,
and
had
had
some
drink
to
celebrate
his
bargain
.
<EOS>
He
had
ridden
the
new
mare
into
Monkshaven
,
and
left
her
at
the
smithy
there
until
morning
,
to
have
her
feet
looked
at
,
and
to
be
new
shod
.
<EOS>
On
his
way
from
the
town
he
had
met
Kinraid
wandering
about
in
search
of
Haytersbank
Farm
itself
,
so
he
had
just
brought
him
along
with
him
;
and
here
they
were
,
ready
for
bread
and
cheese
,
and
aught
else
<EOS>
the
mistress
would
set
before
them
.
  
<EOS>
To
Sylvia
the
sudden
change
into
brightness
and
bustle
occasioned
by
the
entrance
of
her
father
and
<EOS>
the
specksioneer
was
like
that
which
you
may
effect
any
winter
's
night
,
when
you
come
into
a
room
where
a
great
lump
of
coal
lies
hot
and
slumbering
on
the
fire
;
just
break
it
up
with
a
judicious
blow
from
the
poker
,
and
the
room
,
late
so
dark
,
and
dusk
,
and
lone
,
is
full
of
life
,
and
light
,
and
warmth
.
  
<EOS>
She
moved
about
with
pretty
household
briskness
,
attending
to
all
her
father
's
wants
.
<EOS>
Kinraid
's
eye
watched
her
as
she
went
backwards
and
forwards
,
to
and
fro
,
into
the
pantry
,
the
back
-
kitchen
,
out
of
light
into
shade
,
out
of
the
shadow
into
the
broad
firelight
where
he
could
see
and
note
her
appearance
.
<EOS>
She
wore
the
high
-
crowned
linen
cap
of
that
day
,
surmounting
her
lovely
masses
of
golden
brown
hair
,
rather
than
concealing
them
,
and
tied
firm
to
her
head
by
a
broad
blue
ribbon
.
<EOS>
A
long
curl
hung
down
on
each
side
of
her
neck
 
<EOS>
her
throat
<EOS>
rather
,
for
her
neck
was
concealed
by
a
little
spotted
handkerchief
carefully
pinned
across
at
the
waist
of
her
brown
stuff
gown
.
  
<EOS>
How
well
it
was
,
thought
the
young
girl
,
that
she
had
doffed
her
bed
-
gown
and
linsey
-
woolsey
petticoat
,
her
working
-
dress
,
and
made
herself
smart
in
her
stuff
gown
,
when
she
sate
down
to
work
with
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
By
the
time
she
could
sit
down
again
,
her
father
and
Kinraid
had
their
glasses
filled
,
and
were
talking
of
the
relative
merits
of
various
kinds
of
spirits
;
that
led
on
to
tales
of
smuggling
,
and
the
different
contrivances
by
which
they
or
their
friends
had
eluded
the
preventive
service
;
the
nightly
relays
of
men
to
carry
the
goods
inland
;
the
kegs
of
brandy
found
by
certain
farmers
whose
horses
had
gone
so
far
in
the
night
,
that
they
could
do
no
work
the
next
day
;
the
clever
way
in
which
certain
women
managed
to
bring
in
prohibited
goods
;
in
fact
,
that
when
a
woman
did
give
her
mind
to
smuggling
,
she
was
more
full
of
resources
,
and
tricks
,
and
impudence
,
and
energy
than
any
man
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
question
of
the
morality
of
the
affair
;
one
of
the
greatest
signs
of
the
real
progress
we
have
made
since
those
times
seems
to
be
that
our
daily
concerns
of
buying
and
selling
,
eating
and
drinking
,
whatsoever
we
do
,
are
more
tested
by
the
real
practical
standard
of
our
religion
than
they
were
in
the
days
of
our
grandfathers
.
<EOS>
Neither
Sylvia
nor
her
mother
was
in
advance
of
their
age
.
<EOS>
Both
listened
with
admiration
to
the
ingenious
devices
,
and
acted
as
well
as
spoken
lies
,
that
were
talked
about
as
fine
and
spirited
things
.
<EOS>
Yet
if
Sylvia
had
attempted
one
tithe
of
this
deceit
in
her
every
-
day
life
,
it
would
have
half
broken
her
mother
's
heart
.
<EOS>
But
when
the
duty
on
salt
was
strictly
and
cruelly
enforced
,
making
it
penal
to
pick
up
rough
dirty
lumps
containing
small
quantities
that
might
be
thrown
out
with
the
ashes
of
the
brine
-
houses
on
the
high
-
roads
;
when
the
price
of
this
necessary
was
so
increased
by
the
tax
upon
it
as
to
make
it
an
expensive
,
sometimes
an
unattainable
,
luxury
to
the
working
man
,
Government
did
more
to
demoralise
the
popular
sense
of
rectitude
and
uprightness
than
heaps
of
sermons
could
undo
.
<EOS>
And
the
same
,
though
in
smaller
measure
,
was
the
consequence
of
many
other
taxes
.
<EOS>
It
may
seem
curious
to
trace
up
the
popular
standard
of
truth
to
taxation
;
but
I
do
not
think
the
idea
would
be
so
very
far
-
fetched
.
  
<EOS>
From
smuggling
adventures
it
was
easy
to
pass
on
to
stories
of
what
had
happened
to
Robson
,
in
his
youth
a
sailor
in
the
Greenland
seas
,
and
to
Kinraid
,
now
one
of
the
best
harpooners
in
any
whaler
that
sailed
off
the
coast
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
three
things
to
be
afeared
on
,
"
said
Robson
,
authoritatively
:
"
there
's
t
'
ice
<EOS>
,
that
's
bad
;
there
's
dirty
weather
,
that
's
worse
;
and
there
's
whales
theirselves
,
as
is
t
'
worst
of
all
<EOS>
;
leastways
,
they
was
i
'
<EOS>
my
days
;
t
'
darned
brutes
may
ha
'
larnt
better
manners
sin
'
.
<EOS>
When
I
were
young
,
they
could
niver
be
got
to
let
theirsels
be
harpooned
wi'out
<EOS>
flounderin
'
and
makin
'
play
wi
'
<EOS>
their
tales
and
their
fins
,
till
t
'
say
were
all
in
a
foam
,
and
t
'
boats
'
crews
was
all
o'er
wi
'
spray
,
which
i
'
them
latitudes
is
a
kind
o
'
shower
-
bath
not
needed
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Th
'
whales
has
n't
mended
their
manners
,
as
you
call
it
,
"
said
Kinraid
;
"
but
th
'
ice
is
not
to
be
spoken
lightly
on
.
<EOS>
I
were
once
in
th
'
ship
_
John
_
of
Hull
,
and
we
were
in
good
green
water
,
and
were
keen
after
whales
;
and
ne'er
thought
harm
of
a
great
gray
iceberg
as
were
on
our
lee
-
bow
,
a
mile
or
so
off
;
it
looked
as
if
it
had
been
there
from
the
days
of
Adam
,
and
were
likely
to
see
th
'
last
man
out
,
and
it
ne'er
a
bit
bigger
nor
smaller
in
all
them
<EOS>
thousands
and
thousands
o
'
years
.
<EOS>
Well
,
the
fast
-
boats
were
out
after
a
fish
,
and
I
were
specksioneer
in
one
;
and
we
were
so
keen
after
capturing
our
whale
,
that
none
on
us
ever
saw
that
we
were
drifting
away
from
them
right
into
deep
shadow
o
'
th
'
iceberg
.
<EOS>
But
we
were
set
upon
our
whale
,
and
I
harpooned
it
;
and
as
soon
as
it
were
dead
we
lashed
its
fins
together
,
and
fastened
its
tail
to
our
boat
;
and
then
we
took
breath
and
looked
about
us
,
and
away
from
us
a
little
space
were
th
'
other
boats
,
wi
'
two
other
fish
making
play
,
and
as
likely
as
not
to
break
loose
,
for
I
may
say
as
I
were
th
'
best
harpooner
on
board
the
_
John
_
,
<EOS>
wi'out
<EOS>
saying
great
things
<EOS>
o
'
mysel
'
.
<EOS>
So
I
says
,
"
<EOS>
My
lads
,
one
o
<EOS>
'
you
stay
<EOS>
i
'
th
'
boat
by
this
fish
<EOS>
,
"
 
the
fins
o
'
which
,
as
I
said
,
I
'd
reeved
a
rope
through
mysel
'
,
and
which
was
as
dead
as
Noah
's
grandfather
 
<EOS>
"
and
th
'
rest
on
us
shall
go
off
and
help
th
'
other
boats
wi
'
their
fish
.
<EOS>
"
For
,
you
see
,
we
had
another
boat
close
by
in
order
to
sweep
th
'
fish
.
<EOS>
(
I
suppose
they
swept
fish
<EOS>
i
'
your
time
,
master
?
)
<EOS>
'
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
!
"
said
Robson
;
"
one
boat
lies
still
holding
t
'
end
o
'
t
'
line
;
t
'
other
makes
a
circuit
round
t
'
fish
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
!
luckily
for
us
we
had
our
second
boat
,
for
we
all
got
into
it
,
ne'er
<EOS>
a
man
on
us
was
left
i
'
th
'
fast
-
boat
.
<EOS>
And
says
I
,
"
<EOS>
But
who
's
to
stay
by
t
<EOS>
'
dead
fish
?
"
<EOS>
And
no
man
answered
,
for
they
were
all
as
keen
as
me
for
to
go
and
help
our
mates
;
and
we
thought
as
we
could
come
back
to
our
dead
fish
,
as
had
a
boat
for
a
buoy
,
once
we
had
helped
our
mates
.
<EOS>
So
off
we
rowed
,
every
man
Jack
on
us
,
out
o
'
the
black
shadow
o
'

Well

<EOS>
we
had
na

been
a
dozen
fathoms
away
fra

th

as

had
left
,
when
crash
!
<EOS>
down
wi
'
a
roaring
noise
,
and
then
a
gulp
of
the
deep
waters
,
and
then
a
shower
o
'
blinding
spray
;
and
when
we
had
wiped
our
eyes
clear
,
and
getten
our
hearts
down
agen
fra
'
our
mouths
,
there
were
never
a
boat
nor
a
glittering
belly
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
e'er
<EOS>
a
great
whale
to
be
seen
;
but
th
'
iceberg
were
there
,
still
and
grim
,
as
if
a
hundred
ton
or
more
had
fallen
off
all
in
a
mass
,
and
crushed
down
boat
,
and
fish
,
and
all
,
into
th
'
deep
water
,
as
goes
half
through
the
earth

<EOS>
Th

deep

And
I

in

on

"
  
"
But
what
a

no

in

"
said
Bell
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why

mistress

I
reckon
we

must
die
some
way

I
'd
as

down

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
must
be
so
cold

said
Sylvia
,
shuddering
and
giving
a
little
poke
to
the
fire
to
warm
her
fancy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Cold

said
her

First

But
there

said
Kinraid

<EOS>
I
was
once
a
voyage
<EOS>
i
'
an
American
.
<EOS>
They
goes
for
th
'
most
part
south
,
to
where
you
come
round
to
t
'
cold
again
;
and
they
'll
stay
there
for
three
year
at
a
time
,
if
need
be
,
going
into
winter
harbour
<EOS>
i
'
<EOS>
some
o
'
th
'
Pacific
Islands
.
<EOS>
Well
,
we
were
i
'
th
'
southern
seas
,
a
-
seeking
for
good
whaling
-
ground
;
and
,
close
on
our
larboard
beam
,
there
were
a
great
wall
o
'
ice
,
as
much
as
sixty
feet
high
.
<EOS>
And
says
our
captain
 
as
were
a
dare
-
devil
,
if
ever
a
man
were
 
"
There
'll
be
an
opening
in
yon
dark
gray
wall
,
and
into
that
opening
I
'll
sail
,
if
I
coast
along
it
till
th
'
day
o
'
judgment
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
for
all
our
sailing
,
we
never
seemed
to
come
nearer
to
th
'
opening
.
<EOS>
The
waters
were
rocking
beneath
us
,
and
the
sky
were
steady
above
us
;
and
th
'
ice
rose
out
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
the
waters
,
and
seemed
to
reach
up
into
the
sky
.
<EOS>
We
sailed
on
,
and
we
sailed
on
,
for
more
days
nor
I
could
count
.
<EOS>
Our
captain
were
a
strange
,
wild
man
,
but
once
he
looked
a
little
pale
when
he
came
upo
'
deck
after
his
turn
-
in
,
and
saw
the
green
-
gray
ice
going
straight
up
on
our
beam
.
<EOS>
Many
on
us
thought
as
the
ship
were
bewitched
for
th
'
captain
's
words
;
and
we
got
to
speak
low
,
and
to
say
our
prayers
o
'
nights
,
and
a
kind
<EOS>
o
'
dull
silence
came
into
th
'
very
air
;
our
voices
did
na
'
rightly
seem
our
own
.
<EOS>
And
we
sailed
on
,
and
we
sailed
on
.
<EOS>
All
at
once
,
th
'
man
as
were
on
watch
gave
a
cry
:
he
saw
a
break
in
the
ice
,
as
we
'd
begun
to
think
were
everlasting
;
and
we
all
gathered
towards
the
bows
,
and
the
captain
called
to
th
'
man
at
the
helm
to
keep
her
course
,
and
cocked
his
head
,
and
began
to
walk
the
quarter
-
deck
jaunty
again
.
<EOS>
And
we
came
to
a
great
cleft
in
th
'
long
weary
rock
of
ice
;
and
the
sides
o
'
th
'
cleft
were
not
jagged
,
but
went
straight
sharp
down
into
th
'
foaming
waters
.
<EOS>
But
we
took
but
one
look
at
what
lay
inside
,
for
our
captain
,
with
a
loud
cry
to
God
,
bade
the
helmsman
steer
<EOS>
nor'ards
away
<EOS>
fra
'
th
'
mouth
o
'
<EOS>
Hell
.
<EOS>
We
all
saw
wi
'
our
own
eyes
,
inside
that
fearsome
wall
o
'
ice
 
seventy
miles
long
,
as
we
could
swear
to
 
inside
that
gray
,
cold
ice
,
came
leaping
flames
,
all
red
and
yellow
wi
'
<EOS>
heat
o
'
some
unearthly
kind
out
<EOS>
o
'
th
'
very
waters
<EOS>
o
'
the
sea
;
making
our
eyes
dazzle
wi
'
their
scarlet
blaze
,
that
shot
up
as
high
,
nay
,
higher
than
th
'
ice
around
,
yet
never
so
much
as
a
shred
on
'
<EOS>
t
was
melted
.
<EOS>
They
did
say
that
some
beside
our
captain
saw
the
black
devils
dart
hither
and
thither
,
quicker
than
the
very
flames
themselves
;
anyhow
,
he
saw
them
.
<EOS>
And
as
he
knew
it
were
his
own
daring
as
had
led
him
to
have
that
peep
at
terrors
forbidden
to
any
on
us
<EOS>
afore
our
time
,
he
just
dwined
away
,
and
we
had
n't
taken
but
one
whale
afore
our
captain
died
,
and
first
mate
took
th
'
command
.
<EOS>
It
were
a
prosperous
voyage
;
but
,
for
all
that
,
I
'll
never
sail
those
seas
again
,
nor
ever
take
wage
aboard
an
American
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eh

it

awful

aghast

Sylvia
had
dropped
her
work
,
and
sat
gazing
at
Kinraid
with
fascinated
wonder
.
  
<EOS>
Daniel
was
just
a
little
annoyed
at
the
admiration
which
his
own
wife
and
daughter
were
bestowing
on
the
specksioneer
's
wonderful
stories
,
and
he
said
    
"
Ay

<EOS>
let

's

.
<EOS>
So
a
tugged
,
and
a
lugged
,
and
t
'
whale
<EOS>
did
n't
mistake
it
for
ticklin

but
she
cocks
up
her
tail
,
and
throws
out
showers
o

water
as

or
iver

but

but
at

t

broke
,
an
'
just
i
'
time
,
for
a
reckon
she
was
near
as
tired
o
<EOS>
'
me
as

were
on
her

and
down
she
went
;
an
'
a

hard
work
to
make

<EOS>
as
was
near
enough
to

it

,
as

an
oud

<EOS>
"
  
"
Eh
dear
a
'
me
!
"
said
Bell
,
"
<EOS>
how
well
I
mind
yo'r
telling
me
that
tale
!
<EOS>
It
were
twenty
-
four
year
ago
come
October
.
<EOS>
I
thought
I
never
could
think
enough
on
a
man
as
had
rode
on
a
whale
's
back
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yo
'
may
learn
t
'
way
of
winnin
'
t
'
women
,
"
said
Daniel
,
winking
at
the
specksioneer
.
  
<EOS>
And
Kinraid
immediately
looked
at
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
premeditated
action
;
it
came
as
naturally
as
wakening
in
the
morning
when
his
sleep
was
ended
;
but
Sylvia
coloured
as
red
as
any
rose
at
his
sudden
glance
,
 
coloured
so
deeply
that
he
looked
away
until
he
thought
she
had
recovered
her
composure
,
and
then
he
sat
gazing
at
her
again
.
<EOS>
But
not
for
long
,
for
Bell
suddenly
starting
up
,
did
all
but
turn
him
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
It
was
late
,
she
said
,
and
her
master
was
tired
,
and
they
had
a
hard
day
before
them
next
day
;
and
it
was
keeping
Ellen
Corney
up
;
and
they
had
had
enough
to
drink
,
 
more
than
was
good
for
them
,
she
was
sure
,
for
they
had
both
been
taking
her
in
with
their
stories
,
which
she
had
been
foolish
enough
to
believe
.
<EOS>
No
one
saw
the
real
motive
of
all
this
almost
inhospitable
haste
to
dismiss
her
guest
,
how
the
sudden
fear
had
taken
possession
of
her
that
he
and
Sylvia
were
"
fancying
each
other
"
.
<EOS>
Kinraid
had
said
early
in
the
evening
that
he
had
come
to
thank
her
for
her
kindness
in
sending
the
sausages
,
as
he
was
off
to
his
own
home
near
Newcastle
in
a
day
or
two
.
<EOS>
But
now
he
said
,
in
reply
to
Daniel
Robson
,
that
he
would
step
in
another
night
before
long
and
hear
some
more
of
the
old
man
's
yarns
.
  
<EOS>
Daniel
had
just
had
enough
drink
to
make
him
very
good
-
tempered
,
or
else
<EOS>
his
wife
would
not
have
dared
to
have
acted
as
she
did
;
and
this
maudlin
amiability
took
the
shape
of
hospitable
urgency
that
Kinraid
should
come
as
often
as
he
liked
to
Haytersbank
;
come
and
make
it
his
home
when
he
was
in
these
parts
;
stay
there
altogether
,
and
so
on
,
till
Bell
fairly
shut
the
outer
door
to
,
and
locked
it
before
the
specksioneer
had
well
got
out
of
the
shadow
of
their
roof
.
  
<EOS>
All
night
long
Sylvia
dreamed
of
burning
volcanoes
springing
out
of
icy
southern
seas
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
in
the
specksioneer
's
tale
the
flames
were
peopled
with
demons
,
there
was
no
human
interest
for
her
in
the
wondrous
scene
in
which
she
was
no
actor
,
only
a
spectator
.
<EOS>
With
daylight
came
wakening
and
little
homely
every
-
day
wonders
.
<EOS>
Did
Kinraid
mean
that
he
was
going
away
really
and
entirely
,
or
did
he
not
?
<EOS>
Was
he
Molly
Corney
's
sweetheart
,
or
was
he
not
?
<EOS>
When
she
had
argued
herself
into
certainty
on
one
side
,
she
suddenly
wheeled
about
,
and
was
just
of
the
opposite
opinion
.
<EOS>
At
length
she
settled
that
it
could
not
be
settled
until
she
saw
Molly
again
;
so
,
by
a
strong
gulping
effort
,
she
resolutely
determined
to
think
no
more
about
him
,
only
about
the
marvels
he
had
told
.
<EOS>
She
might
think
a
little
about
them
when
she
sat
at
night
,
spinning
in
silence
by
the
household
fire
,
or
when
she
went
out
in
the
gloaming
to
call
the
cattle
home
to
be
milked
,
and
sauntered
back
behind
the
patient
,
slow
-
gaited
creatures
;
and
at
times
on
future
summer
days
,
when
,
as
in
the
past
,
she
took
her
knitting
out
for
the
sake
of
the
freshness
of
the
faint
sea
-
breeze
,
and
dropping
down
from
ledge
to
ledge
of
the
rocks
that
faced
the
blue
ocean
,
established
herself
in
a
perilous
nook
that
had
been
her
haunt
ever
since
her
parents
had
come
to
Haytersbank
Farm
.
<EOS>
From
thence
she
had
often
seen
the
distant
ships
pass
to
and
fro
,
with
a
certain
sort
of
lazy
pleasure
in
watching
their
swift
tranquillity
of
motion
,
but
no
thought
as
to
where
they
were
bound
to
,
or
what
strange
places
they
would
penetrate
to
before
they
turned
again
,
homeward
bound
.
    
<EOS>
A
REFRACTORY
PUPIL
  
Sylvia
was
still
full
of
the
specksioneer
and
his
stories
,
when
Hepburn
came
up
to
give
her
the
next
lesson
.
<EOS>
But
the
prospect
of
a
little
sensible
commendation
for
writing
a
whole
page
full
of
flourishing
"
Abednegos
,
"
had
lost
all
the
slight
charm
it
had
ever
possessed
.
<EOS>
She
was
much
more
inclined
to
try
and
elicit
some
sympathy
in
her
interest
in
the
perils
and
adventures
of
the
northern
seas
,
than
to
bend
and
control
her
mind
to
the
right
formation
of
letters
.
<EOS>
Unwisely
enough
,
she
endeavoured
to
repeat
one
of
the
narratives
that
she
had
heard
from
Kinraid
;
and
when
she
found
that
Hepburn
(
if
,
indeed
,
he
did
not
look
upon
the
whole
as
a
silly
invention
)
considered
it
only
as
an
interruption
to
the
real
business
in
hand
,
to
which
he
would
try
to
listen
as
patiently
as
he
could
,
in
the
hope
of
Sylvia
's
applying
herself
diligently
to
her
copy
-
book
when
she
had
cleared
her
mind
,
she
contracted
her
pretty
lips
,
as
if
to
check
them
from
making
any
further
appeals
for
sympathy
,
and
set
about
her
writing
-
lesson
in
a
very
rebellious
frame
of
mind
,
only
restrained
by
her
mother
's
presence
from
spoken
mutiny
.
  
<EOS>
"
After
all
,
"
said
she
,
throwing
down
her
pen
,
and
opening
and
shutting
her
weary
,
cramped
hand
,
"
I
see
no
good
in
tiring
myself
wi
'
learning
for

'

letters
when
I'se
never

my

<EOS>
What
for
should
I
write
answers
,
when
there
's
niver
a
one
writes
to
me
?
<EOS>
and
if
I
had
one
,
I
could
n't

it
<EOS>
;
it
's
bad
enough
wi
'
a

o

as
I
've
niver
seen
afore

for
there
's
sure
to
be

<EOS>
I
'm
sure
I
wish
the
man
were
farred
who
plagues
his
brains
wi

striking
out
new
words

<EOS>
Why

you
'll
be
after
using
two
or
three
hundred
yoursel
'
every
day
as
you
live
,
Sylvie
;
<EOS>
and
yet
I
must
use
a
great
many
as
you
never
think
on
about
t
'
shop
;
and
<EOS>
t
'
folks
in
t
'
fields
want
their

let
alone
the

English
that
parsons

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well

it

weary
work

reading
and

<EOS>
Can
not
you
learn

something
else
,
if
we
mun
do
lessons
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
sums
 
and
geography
,
"
said
Hepburn
,
slowly
and
gravely
.
  
<EOS>
"
Geography
!
<EOS>
"
said
Sylvia
,
brightening
,
and
perhaps
not
pronouncing
the
word
quite
correctly
,
"
I
'd
like
yo
'
to
learn
me
geography
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
deal
o

places
I
want
to
hear
all
about
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
'll
bring
up
a
book
and
a
map
next
time
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
tell
you
something
now
.
<EOS>
There
's
four
quarters
in
the
globe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
?
"
asked
Sylvia
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
globe
is
the
earth
;
the
place
we
live
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Go
on
.
<EOS>
Which
quarter
is
Greenland
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Greenland
is
no
quarter
.
<EOS>
It
is
only
a
part
of
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Maybe
it
's
a
half
quarter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
so
much
as
that
.
"
  
"
Half
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
!
"
<EOS>
he
replied
,
smiling
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
She
thought
he
was
making
it
into
a
very
small
place
in
order
to
tease
her
;
so
she
pouted
a
little
,
and
then
said
,
    
"
Greenland
is
all
t
'
geography
I
want
to
know
.
<EOS>
Except
,
perhaps
,
York
.
<EOS>
I
'd
like
to
learn
about
York
,
because
of
t
'
races
,
and
London
,
because
King
George
lives
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
you
learn
geography
at
all
,
you
must
learn
'bout
all
places
:
which
of
them
is
hot
,
and
which
is
cold
,
and
how
many
inhabitants
is
in
each
,
and
what
's
the
rivers
,
and
which
is
the
principal
towns
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
,
Sylvie
,
if
Philip
will
learn
thee
all
that
<EOS>
,
thou'lt
be
such
a
sight
o
'
knowledge
as
ne'er
<EOS>
a
one
o

th
'
Prestons

<EOS>
my
great

grandfather
lost
his
property
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
main
proud
o
'
thee
;
"
twould
seem
as
if
we
was
Prestons
o
'
Slaideburn
once
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'd
do
a
deal
to
pleasure
yo
'
,
mammy
;
but
weary
befa
'
riches
and
land
,
if

that

'em

to

"
by

and
to

"
  
<EOS>
This
seemed
to
be
Sylvia
's
last
protest
against
learning
for
the
night
,
for
after
this
she
turned
docile
,
and
really
took
pains
to
understand
all
that
Philip
could
teach
her
,
by
means
of
the
not
unskilful
,
though
rude
,
map
which
he
drew
for
her
with
a
piece
of
charred
wood
on
his
aunt
's
dresser
.
<EOS>
He
had
asked
his
aunt
's
leave
before
beginning
what
Sylvia
called
his
"
dirty
work
;
"
but
by
-
and
-
by
<EOS>
even
she
became
a
little
interested
in
starting
from
a
great
black
spot
called
Monkshaven
,
and
in
the
shaping
of
land
and
sea
around
that
one
centre
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
held
her
round
chin
in
the
palms
of
her
hands
,
supporting
her
elbows
on
the
dresser
;
looking
down
at
the
progress
of
the
rough
drawing
in
general
,
but
now
and
then
glancing
up
at
him
with
sudden
inquiry
.
<EOS>
All
along
he
was
not
so
much
absorbed
in
his
teaching
as
to
be
unconscious
of
her
sweet
proximity
.
<EOS>
She
was
in
her
best
mood
towards
him
;
neither
mutinous
nor
saucy
;
and
he
was
striving
with
all
his
might
to
retain
her
interest
,
speaking
better
than
ever
he
had
done
before
(
such
brightness
did
love
call
forth
!
)
 
<EOS>
understanding
what
she
would
care
to
hear
and
to
know
<EOS>
;
when
,
in
the
middle
of
an
attempt
at
explaining
the
cause
of
the
long
polar
days
,
of
which
she
had
heard
from
her
childhood
,
he
felt
that
her
attention
was
no
longer
his
;
that
a
discord
had
come
in
between
their
minds
;
that
she
had
passed
out
of
his
power
.
<EOS>
This
certainty
of
intuition
lasted
but
for
an
instant
;
he
had
no
time
to
wonder
or
to
speculate
as
to
what
had
affected
her
so
adversely
to
his
wishes
before
the
door
opened
and
Kinraid
came
in
.
<EOS>
Then
Hepburn
knew
that
she
must
have
heard
his
coming
footsteps
,
and
recognized
them
.
  
<EOS>
He
angrily
stiffened
himself
up
into
coldness
of
demeanour
.
<EOS>
Almost
to
his
surprise
,
Sylvia
's
greeting
to
the
new
comer
was
as
cold
as
his
own
.
<EOS>
She
stood
rather
behind
him
;
so
perhaps
she
did
not
see
the
hand
which
Kinraid
stretched
out
towards
her
,
for
she
did
not
place
her
own
little
palm
in
it
,
as
she
had
done
to
Philip
an
hour
ago
.
<EOS>
And
she
hardly
spoke
,
but
began
to
pore
over
the
rough
black
map
,
as
if
seized
with
strong
geographical
curiosity
,
or
determined
to
impress
Philip
's
lesson
deep
on
her
memory
.
  
<EOS>
Still
Philip
was
dismayed
by
seeing
the
warm
welcome
which
Kinraid
received
from
the
master
of
the
house
,
who
came
in
from
the
back
premises
almost
at
the
same
time
as
the
specksioneer
entered
at
the
front
.
<EOS>
Hepburn
was
uneasy
,
too
,
at
finding
Kinraid
take
his
seat
by
the
fireside
,
like
one
accustomed
to
the
ways
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Pipes
were
soon
produced
.
<EOS>
Philip
disliked
smoking
.
<EOS>
Possibly
Kinraid
did
so
too
,
but
he
took
a
pipe
at
any
rate
,
and
lighted
it
,
though
he
hardly
used
it
at
all
,
but
kept
talking
to
farmer
Robson
on
sea
affairs
.
<EOS>
He
had
the
conversation
pretty
much
to
himself
.
<EOS>
Philip
sat
gloomily
by
;
Sylvia
and
his
aunt
were
silent
,
and
old
Robson
smoked
his
long
clay
pipe
,
from
time
to
time
taking
it
out
of
his
mouth
to
spit
into
the
bright
copper
spittoon
,
and
to
shake
the
white
ashes
out
of
the
bowl
.
<EOS>
Before
he
replaced
it
,
he
would
give
a
short
laugh
of
relishing
interest
in
Kinraid
's
conversation
;
and
now
<EOS>
and
then
he
put
in
a
remark
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
perched
herself
sideways
on
the
end
of
the
dresser
,
and
made
pretence
to
sew
;
but
Philip
could
see
how
often
she
paused
in
her
work
to
listen
.
  
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
,
his
aunt
spoke
to
him
,
and
they
kept
up
a
little
side
conversation
,
more
because
Bell
Robson
felt
that
her
nephew
,
her
own
flesh
and
blood
,
was
put
out
,
than
for
any
special
interest
they
either
of
them
felt
in
what
they
were
saying
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
also
,
they
neither
of
them
disliked
showing
that
they
had
no
great
faith
in
the
stories
Kinraid
was
telling
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Robson
,
at
any
rate
,
knew
so
little
as
to
be
afraid
of
believing
too
much
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
was
sitting
on
that
side
of
the
fire
which
was
nearest
to
the
window
and
to
Sylvia
,
and
opposite
to
the
specksioneer
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
turned
to
his
cousin
and
said
in
a
low
voice
    
"
<EOS>
I
suppose
we
ca
n't
go
on
with
our
spell
at
geography
till
that
fellow
's
gone
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
colour
came
into
Sylvia
's
cheek
at
the
words
"
that
fellow
"
;
but
she
only
replied
with
a
careless
air
    
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
'm
one
as
thinks
enough
is
as
good
as
a
feast
;
and
I
've
had
enough
of
geography
this
one
night
,
thank
you
kindly
all
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
took
refuge
in
offended
silence
.
<EOS>
He
was
maliciously
pleased
when
his
aunt
made
so
much
noise
with
her
preparation
for
supper
as
quite
to
prevent
the
sound
of
the
sailor
's
words
from
reaching
Sylvia
's
ears
.
<EOS>
She
saw
that
he
was
glad
to
perceive
that
her
efforts
to
reach
the
remainder
of
the
story
were
baulked
!
<EOS>
this
nettled
her
,
and
,
determined
not
to
let
him
have
his
malicious
triumph
,
and
still
more
to
put
a
stop
to
any
attempt
at
private
conversation
,
she
began
to
sing
to
herself
as
she
sat
at
her
work
;
till
,
suddenly
seized
with
a
desire
to
help
her
mother
,
she
dexterously
slipped
down
from
her
seat
,
passed
Hepburn
,
and
was
on
her
knees
toasting
cakes
right
in
front
of
the
fire
,
and
just
close
to
her
father
and
Kinraid
.
<EOS>
And
now
the
noise
that
Hepburn
had
so
rejoiced
in
proved
his
foe
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
hear
the
little
merry
speeches
that
darted
backwards
and
forwards
as
the
specksioneer
tried
to
take
the
toasting
-
fork
out
of
Sylvia
's
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
comes
that
sailor
chap
here
?
"
asked
Hepburn
of
his
aunt
.
"
<EOS>
He
's
none
fit
to
be
where
Sylvia
is
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
I
dunnot
know
,
"
said
she
;
"
the
Corneys
made
us
acquaint
first
,
and
my
master
is
quite
fain
of
his
company
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
do
you
like
him
,
too
,
aunt
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Hepburn
,
almost
wistfully
;
he
had
followed
Mrs.
Robson
into
the
dairy
on
pretence
of
helping
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
none
fond
on
him
;
I
think
he
tells
us
traveller
's
tales
,
by
way
<EOS>
o
'
seeing
how
much
we
can
swallow
.
<EOS>
But
the
master
and
Sylvia
think
that
there
never
was
such
a
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
show
them
a
score
as
good
as
he
down
on
the
quayside
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
laddie
,
keep
a
calm
sough
.
<EOS>
Some
folk
like
some
folk
and
others
do
n't
.
<EOS>
Wherever
I
am
there
'll
allays
be
a
welcome
for
thee
.
"
  
<EOS>
For
the
good
woman
thought
that
he
had
been
hurt
by
the
evident
absorption
of
her
husband
and
daughter
with
their
new
friend
,
and
wished
to
make
all
easy
and
straight
.
<EOS>
But
do
what
she
would
,
he
did
not
recover
his
temper
all
evening
:
he
was
uncomfortable
,
put
out
,
not
enjoying
himself
,
and
yet
he
would
not
go
.
<EOS>
He
was
determined
to
assert
his
greater
intimacy
in
that
house
by
outstaying
Kinraid
.
<EOS>
At
length
the
latter
got
up
to
go
;
but
before
he
went
,
he
must
needs
bend
over
Sylvia
and
say
something
to
her
in
so
low
a
tone
that
Philip
could
not
hear
it
;
and
she
,
seized
with
a
sudden
fit
of
diligence
,
never
looked
up
from
her
sewing
;
only
nodded
her
head
by
way
of
reply
.
<EOS>
At
last
he
took
his
departure
,
after
many
a
little
delay
,
and
many
a
quick
return
,
which
to
the
suspicious
Philip
seemed
only
pretences
for
taking
stolen
glances
at
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
was
decidedly
gone
,
she
folded
up
her
work
,
and
declared
that
she
was
so
much
tired
that
she
must
go
to
bed
there
<EOS>
and
then
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
,
too
,
had
been
dozing
for
the
last
half
-
hour
,
and
was
only
too
glad
to
see
signs
that
she
might
betake
herself
to
her
natural
place
of
slumber
.
  
<EOS>
"
Take
another
glass
,
Philip
,
"
said
farmer
Robson
.
  
<EOS>
But
Hepburn
refused
the
offer
rather
abruptly
.
<EOS>
He
drew
near
to
Sylvia
instead
.
<EOS>
He
wanted
to
make
her
speak
to
him
,
and
he
saw
that
she
wished
to
avoid
it
.
<EOS>
He
took
up
the
readiest
pretext
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
unwise
one
as
it
proved
,
for
it
deprived
him
of
his
chances
of
occasionally
obtaining
her
undivided
attention
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
you
care
much
for
learning
geography
,
Sylvie
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
much
to
-
night
,
"
said
she
,
making
a
pretence
to
yawn
,
yet
looking
timidly
up
at
his
countenance
of
displeasure
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
at
any
time
,
"
said
he
,
with
growing
anger
;
"
nor
for
any
kind
of
learning
.
<EOS>
I
did
bring
some
books
last
time
I
came
,
meaning
to
teach
you
many
a
thing
 
<EOS>
but
now
I
'll
just
trouble
you
for
my
books
;
I
put
them
on
yon
shelf
by
the
Bible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
a
mind
that
she
should
bring
them
to
him
;
that
,
at
any
rate
,
he
should
have
the
pleasure
of
receiving
them
out
of
her
hands
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
did
not
reply
,
but
went
and
took
down
the
books
with
a
languid
,
indifferent
air
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
you
wo
n't
learn
any
more
geography
,
"
said
Hepburn
.
  
<EOS>
Something
in
his
tone
struck
her
,
and
she
looked
up
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
There
were
marks
of
stern
offence
upon
his
countenance
,
and
yet
in
it
there
was
also
an
air
of
wistful
regret
and
sadness
that
touched
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yo're
niver
angry
with
me
,
Philip
?
<EOS>
Sooner
than
vex
yo
'
,
I
'll
try
and
learn
.
<EOS>
Only
,
I
'm
just
stupid
;
and
it
mun
be
such
a
trouble
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hepburn
would
fain
have
snatched
at
this
half
proposal
that
the
lessons
should
be
continued
,
but
he
was
too
stubborn
and
proud
to
say
anything
.
<EOS>
He
turned
away
from
the
sweet
,
pleading
face
without
a
word
,
to
wrap
up
his
books
in
a
piece
of
paper
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
she
was
standing
quite
still
by
his
side
,
though
he
made
as
if
he
did
not
perceive
her
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
done
he
abruptly
wished
them
all
"
good
-
night
,
"
and
took
his
leave
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
tears
in
Sylvia
's
eyes
,
although
the
feeling
in
her
heart
was
rather
one
of
relief
.
<EOS>
She
had
made
a
fair
offer
,
and
it
had
been
treated
with
silent
contempt
.
<EOS>
A
few
days
afterwards
,
her
father
came
in
from
Monkshaven
market
,
and
dropped
out
,
among
other
pieces
of
news
,
that
he
had
met
Kinraid
,
who
was
bound
for
his
own
home
at
Cullercoats
.
<EOS>
He
had
desired
his
respects
to
Mrs.
Robson
and
her
daughter
;
and
had
bid
<EOS>
Robson
say
that
he
would
have
come
up
to
Haytersbank
to
wish
them
good
-
by
,
but
that
as
he
was
pressed
for
time
,
he
hoped
they
would
excuse
him
.
<EOS>
But
Robson
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
give
this
long
message
of
mere
politeness
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
as
it
did
not
relate
to
business
,
and
was
only
sent
to
women
,
Robson
forgot
all
about
it
,
pretty
nearly
as
soon
as
it
was
uttered
.
<EOS>
So
Sylvia
went
about
fretting
herself
for
one
or
two
days
,
at
her
hero
's
apparent
carelessness
of
those
who
had
at
any
rate
treated
him
more
like
a
friend
than
an
acquaintance
of
only
a
few
weeks
'
standing
;
and
then
,
<EOS>
her
anger
quenching
her
incipient
regard
<EOS>
,
she
went
about
her
daily
business
pretty
much
as
though
he
had
never
been
.
<EOS>
He
had
gone
away
out
of
her
sight
into
the
thick
mist
of
unseen
life
from
which
he
had
emerged
 
gone
away
without
a
word
,
and
she
might
never
see
him
again
.
<EOS>
But
still
there
was
a
chance
of
her
seeing
him
when
he
came
to
marry
Molly
Corney
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
she
should
be
bridesmaid
,
and
then
what
a
pleasant
merry
time
the
wedding
-
day
would
be
!
<EOS>
The
Corneys
were
all
such
kind
people
,
and
in
their
family
there
never
seemed
to
be
the
checks
and
restraints
by
which
her
own
mother
hedged
her
round
.
<EOS>
Then
there
came
an
overwhelming
self
-
reproaching
burst
of
love
for
that
"
own
mother
"
;
a
humiliation
before
her
slightest
wish
,
as
penance
for
the
moment
's
unspoken
treason
;
and
thus
Sylvia
was
led
to
request
her
cousin
Philip
to
resume
his
lessons
in
so
meek
a
manner
,
that
he
slowly
and
graciously
acceded
to
a
request
which
he
was
yearning
to
fulfil
all
the
time
.
  
<EOS>
During
the
ensuing
winter
,
all
went
on
in
monotonous
regularity
at
Haytersbank
Farm
for
many
weeks
.
<EOS>
Hepburn
came
and
went
,
and
thought
Sylvia
wonderfully
improved
in
docility
and
sobriety
;
and
perhaps
also
he
noticed
the
improvement
in
her
appearance
.
<EOS>
For
she
was
at
that
age
when
a
girl
changes
rapidly
,
and
generally
for
the
better
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
shot
up
into
a
tall
young
woman
;
her
eyes
deepened
in
colour
,
her
face
increased
in
expression
,
and
a
sort
of
consciousness
of
unusual
good
looks
gave
her
a
slight
tinge
of
coquettish
shyness
with
the
few
strangers
whom
she
ever
saw
.
<EOS>
Philip
hailed
her
interest
in
geography
as
another
sign
of
improvement
.
<EOS>
He
had
brought
back
his
book
of
maps
to
the
farm
;
and
there
he
sat
on
many
an
evening
teaching
his
cousin
,
who
had
strange
fancies
respecting
the
places
about
which
she
wished
to
learn
,
and
was
coolly
indifferent
to
the
very
existence
of
other
towns
,
and
countries
,
and
seas
far
more
famous
in
story
.
<EOS>
She
was
occasionally
wilful
,
and
at
times
very
contemptuous
as
to
the
superior
knowledge
of
her
instructor
;
but
,
in
spite
of
it
all
,
Philip
went
regularly
on
the
appointed
evenings
to
Haytersbank
 
through
keen
black
east
wind
,
or
driving
snow
,
or
slushing
thaw
;
for
he
liked
dearly
to
sit
a
little
behind
her
,
with
his
arm
on
the
back
of
her
chair
,
she
stooping
over
the
outspread
map
,
with
her
eyes
<EOS>
,
 
could
he
have
seen
them
,
 
a
good
deal
fixed
on
one
spot
in
the
map
,
not
Northumberland
,
where
Kinraid
was
spending
the
winter
,
but
those
wild
northern
seas
about
which
he
had
told
them
such
wonders
.
  
<EOS>
One
day
towards
spring
,
she
saw
Molly
Corney
coming
towards
the
farm
.
<EOS>
The
companions
had
not
met
for
many
weeks
,
for
Molly
had
been
from
home
visiting
her
relations
in
the
north
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
opened
the
door
,
and
stood
smiling
and
shivering
on
the
threshold
,
glad
to
see
her
friend
again
.
<EOS>
Molly
called
out
,
when
a
few
paces
off
,
    
"
Why
,
Sylvia
,
is
that
thee
!
<EOS>
Why
,
how
thou'rt
growed
,
to
be
sure
!
<EOS>
What
a
bonny
lass
thou
is
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dunnot
talk
nonsense
to
my
lass
,
"
said
Bell
Robson
,
hospitably
leaving
her
ironing
and
coming
to
the
door
;
but
though
the
mother
tried
to
look
as
if
she
thought
it
nonsense
,
she
could
hardly
keep
down
the
smile
that
shone
out
of
her
eyes
,
as
she
put
her
hand
on
Sylvia
's
shoulder
,
with
a
fond
sense
of
proprietorship
in
what
was
being
praised
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
but
she
is
,
"
persisted
Molly
.
<EOS>
"
She
's
grown
quite
a
beauty
sin
'
I
saw
her
.
<EOS>
And
if
I
do
n't
tell
her
so
,
the
men
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Be
quiet
wi
'
thee
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
more
than
half
offended
,
and
turning
away
in
a
huff
at
the
open
barefaced
admiration
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
;
but
they
will
,
"
persevered
Molly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yo'll
not
keep
her
long
,
Mistress
Robson
.
<EOS>
And
as
mother
says
,
yo'd
feel
it
a
deal
more
to
have
yer
daughters
left
on
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thy
mother
has
many
,
I
have
<EOS>
but
this
one
,
"
said
Mrs.
Robson
,
with
severe
sadness
;
for
now
Molly
was
getting
to
talk
as
she
disliked
.
<EOS>
But
Molly
's
purpose
was
to
bring
the
conversation
round
to
her
own
affairs
,
of
which
she
was
very
full
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes

<EOS>
I
tell
mother
that

so
many

"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
?
<EOS>
which
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Sylvia
,
a
little
eagerly
,
seeing
that
there
was
news
of
a
wedding
behind
the
talk
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
!
<EOS>
who
should
it
be
but
me
?
<EOS>
"
said
Molly
,
laughing
a
good
deal
,
and
reddening
a
little
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
not
gone
fra
'
home

I'se
picked
up

<EOS>
"
Charley
Kinraid

said
Sylvia
smiling
,
as
she
found
that
now
she
might
reveal
Molly
's
secret
,
which
hitherto
she
had
kept
sacred
.
  
<EOS>
"
Charley
Kinraid

"
said
Molly
,
with
a
toss
of
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Whatten

(
turning
to
Bell
Robson
,
who
,
perhaps
,
she
thought
would
more
appreciate
the
substantial
advantages
of
her
engagement
than
Sylvia
,

Measter

<EOS>
Mrs.
Robson
gave
her
her
grave
good
wishes
;
but
Sylvia
was
silent
.
<EOS>
She
was
disappointed
;
it
was
a
coming
down
from
the
romance
with
the
specksioneer
for
its
hero
.
<EOS>
Molly
laughed
awkwardly
,
understanding
Sylvia
's
thoughts
better
than
the
latter
imagined
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sylvia
's
noane
so
well
pleased
.
<EOS>
Why

lass

it

he

<EOS>
Molly
's
prosperity
was
giving
her
an
independence
and
fearlessness
of
talk
such
as
had
seldom
appeared
hitherto
;
and
certainly
never
before
Mrs.
Robson
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
was
annoyed
at
Molly
's
whole
tone
and
manner
,
which
were
loud
,
laughing
,
and
boisterous
;
but
to
her
mother
they
were
positively
repugnant
.
<EOS>
She
said
shortly
and
gravely
,
    
"
Sylvia
's
none
so
set
upo
'
matrimony
;
she
's
content
to
bide
wi
'
me
and
her
father

<EOS>
Let
a
be
such
talking
,
it
's
not
i
'
my
way

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Molly
was
a
little
subdued
<EOS>
;
but
still
her
elation
at
the
prospect
of
being
so
well
married
kept
cropping
out
of
all
the
other
subjects
which
were
introduced
;
and
when
she
went
away
,
Mrs.
Robson
broke
out
in
an
unwonted
strain
of
depreciation
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
way

They

making
such
an
ado
about

kind
,
as
if
they
were
two

a

meditatively

scornfully

VISIONS
OF
THE
FUTURE
  
<EOS>
Before
May
was
out
,
Molly
Corney
was
married
and
had
left
the
neighbourhood
for
Newcastle
.
<EOS>
Although
Charley
Kinraid
was
not
the
bridegroom
,
Sylvia
's
promise
to
be
bridesmaid
was
claimed
.
<EOS>
But
the
friendship
brought
on
by
the
circumstances
of
neighbourhood
and
parity
of
age
had
become
very
much
weakened
in
the
time
that
elapsed
between
Molly
's
engagement
and
wedding
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
she
herself
was
so
absorbed
in
her
preparations
,
so
elated
by
her
good
fortune
in
getting
married
,
and
married
,
too
,
before
her
elder
sister
,
that
all
her
faults
blossomed
out
full
and
strong
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
felt
her
to
be
selfish
;
Mrs.
Robson
thought
her
not
maidenly
.
<EOS>
A
year
before
she
would
have
been
far
more
missed
and
regretted
by
Sylvia
;
now
it
was
almost
a
relief
to
the
latter
to
be
freed
from
the
perpetual
calls
upon
her
sympathy
,
from
the
constant
demands
upon
her
congratulations
,
made
by
one
who
had
no
thought
or
feeling
to
bestow
on
others
;
at
least
,
not
in
these
weeks
of
"
cock
-
a
-
doodle
-
dooing
,
"
as
Mrs.
Robson
persisted
in
calling
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
seldom
that
Bell
was
taken
with
a
humorous
idea
;
but
this
once
having
hatched
a
solitary
joke
,
she
was
always
clucking
it
into
notice
 
to
go
on
with
her
own
poultry
simile
.
  
<EOS>
Every
time
during
that
summer
that
Philip
saw
his
cousin
,
he
thought
her
prettier
than
she
had
ever
been
before
;
some
new
touch
of
colour
,
some
fresh
sweet
charm
,
seemed
to
have
been
added
,
just
as
every
summer
day
calls
out
new
beauty
in
the
flowers
.
<EOS>
And
this
was
not
the
addition
of
Philip
's
fancy
.
<EOS>
Hester
Rose
,
who
met
Sylvia
on
rare
occasions
,
came
back
each
time
with
a
candid
,
sad
acknowledgement
in
her
heart
that
it
was
no
wonder
that
Sylvia
was
so
much
admired
and
loved
.
  
<EOS>
One
day
Hester
had
seen
her
sitting
near
her
mother
in
the
market
-
place
;
there
was
a
basket
by
her
,
and
over
the
clean
cloth
that
covered
the
yellow
pounds
of
butter
,
she
had
laid
the
hedge
-
roses
and
honeysuckles
she
had
gathered
on
the
way
into
Monkshaven
;
her
straw
hat
was
on
her
knee
,
and
she
was
busy
placing
some
of
the
flowers
in
the
ribbon
that
went
round
it
.
<EOS>
Then
she
held
it
on
her
hand
,
and
turned
it
round
about
,
putting
her
head
on
one
side
,
the
better
to
view
the
effect
;
and
all
this
time
,
Hester
,
peeping
at
her
through
the
folds
of
the
stuffs
displayed
in
Foster
's
windows
,
saw
her
with
admiring
,
wistful
eyes
;
wondering
,
too
,
if
Philip
,
at
the
other
counter
,
were
aware
of
his
cousin
's
being
there
,
so
near
to
him
.
<EOS>
Then
Sylvia
put
on
her
hat
,
and
,
looking
up
at
Foster
's
windows
,
caught
Hester
's
face
of
interest
,
and
smiled
and
blushed
at
the
consciousness
of
having
been
watched
over
her
little
vanities
,
and
Hester
smiled
back
,
but
rather
sadly
.
<EOS>
Then
a
customer
came
in
,
and
she
had
to
attend
to
her
business
,
which
,
on
this
as
on
all
market
days
,
was
great
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
she
was
aware
of
Philip
rushing
bare
-
headed
out
of
the
shop
,
eager
and
delighted
at
something
he
saw
outside
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
little
looking
-
glass
hung
against
the
wall
on
Hester
's
side
,
placed
in
that
retired
corner
,
in
order
that
the
good
women
who
came
to
purchase
head
-
gear
of
any
kind
might
see
the
effect
thereof
before
they
concluded
their
bargain
.
<EOS>
In
a
pause
of
custom
,
Hester
,
half
-
ashamed
,
stole
into
this
corner
,
and
looked
at
herself
in
the
glass
.
<EOS>
What
did
she
see
?
<EOS>
a
colourless
face
,
dark
soft
hair
with
no
light
gleams
in
it
,
eyes
that
were
melancholy
instead
of
smiling
,
a
mouth
compressed
with
a
sense
of
dissatisfaction
.
<EOS>
This
was
what
she
had
to
compare
with
the
bright
bonny
face
in
the
sunlight
outside
.
<EOS>
She
gave
a
gulp
to
check
the
sigh
that
was
rising
,
and
came
back
,
even
more
patient
than
she
had
been
before
this
disheartening
peep
,
to
serve
all
the
whims
and
fancies
of
purchasers
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
herself
had
been
rather
put
out
by
Philip
's
way
of
coming
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
made
her
look
so
silly
,
"
she
thought
;
and
"
what
for
must
he
make
a
sight
of
himself
,
coming
among
the
market
folk
in
that
-
a
-
way
"
;
and
when
he
took
to
admiring
her
hat
,
she
pulled
out
the
flowers
in
a
pet
,
and
threw
them
down
,
and
trampled
them
under
foot
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
for
art
thou
doing
that
,
Sylvie
?
"
said
her
mother
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
flowers
is
well
enough
,
though
may
-
be
thy
hat
might
ha
'
been
stained
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
like
Philip
to
speak
to
me
so
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
pouting
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
?
"
asked
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
But
Sylvia
could
not
repeat
his
words
.
<EOS>
She
hung
her
head
,
and
looked
red
and
pre
-
occupied
,
anything
but
pleased
.
<EOS>
Philip
had
addressed
his
first
expression
of
personal
admiration
at
an
unfortunate
tune
.
  
<EOS>
It
just
shows
what
different
views
different
men
and
women
take
of
their
fellow
-
creatures
,
when
I
say
that
Hester
looked
upon
Philip
as
the
best
and
most
agreeable
man
she
had
ever
known
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
one
to
speak
of
himself
without
being
questioned
on
the
subject
,
so
his
Haytersbank
relations
,
only
come
into
the
neighborhood
in
the
last
year
or
two
,
knew
nothing
of
the
trials
he
had
surmounted
,
or
the
difficult
duties
he
had
performed
.
<EOS>
His
aunt
,
indeed
,
had
strong
faith
in
him
,
both
from
partial
knowledge
of
his
character
,
and
because
he
was
of
her
own
tribe
and
kin
;
but
she
had
never
learnt
the
small
details
of
his
past
life
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
respected
him
as
her
mother
's
friend
,
and
treated
him
tolerably
well
as
long
as
he
preserved
his
usual
self
-
restraint
of
demeanour
,
but
hardly
ever
thought
of
him
when
he
was
absent
.
  
<EOS>
Now
Hester
,
who
had
watched
him
daily
for
all
the
years
since
he
had
first
come
as
an
errand
-
boy
into
Foster
's
shop
 
watching
with
quiet
,
modest
,
yet
observant
eyes
 
had
seen
how
devoted
he
was
to
his
master
's
interests
,
had
known
of
his
careful
and
punctual
ministration
to
his
absent
mother
's
comforts
,
as
long
as
she
was
living
to
benefit
by
his
silent
,
frugal
self
-
denial
.
  
<EOS>
His
methodical
appropriation
of
the
few
hours
<EOS>
he
could
call
his
own
<EOS>
was
not
without
its
charms
to
the
equally
methodical
Hester
;
the
way
in
which
he
reproduced
any
lately
acquired
piece
of
knowledge
 
knowledge
so
wearisome
to
Sylvia
 
was
delightfully
instructive
to
Hester
 
<EOS>
although
,
as
she
was
habitually
silent
,
it
would
have
required
an
observer
more
interested
in
discovering
her
feelings
than
Philip
was
to
have
perceived
the
little
flush
on
the
pale
cheek
,
and
the
brightness
in
the
half
-
veiled
eyes
whenever
he
was
talking
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
thought
of
love
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
Love
was
a
vanity
,
a
worldliness
not
to
be
spoken
about
,
or
even
thought
about
.
<EOS>
Once
or
twice
before
the
Robsons
came
into
the
neighbourhood
,
an
idea
had
crossed
her
mind
that
possibly
the
quiet
,
habitual
way
in
which
she
and
Philip
lived
together
,
might
drift
them
into
matrimony
at
some
distant
period
;
and
she
could
not
bear
the
humble
advances
which
Coulson
,
Philip
's
fellow
-
lodger
,
sometimes
made
.
<EOS>
They
seemed
to
disgust
her
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
But
after
the
Robsons
settled
at
Haytersbank
,
Philip
's
evenings
were
so
often
spent
there
that
any
unconscious
hopes
Hester
might
,
unawares
,
have
entertained
,
died
away
.
<EOS>
At
first
she
had
felt
a
pang
akin
to
jealousy
when
she
heard
of
Sylvia
,
the
little
cousin
,
who
was
passing
out
of
childhood
into
womanhood
.
<EOS>
Once
 
early
in
those
days
 
she
had
ventured
to
ask
Philip
what
Sylvia
was
like
.
<EOS>
Philip
had
not
warmed
up
at
the
question
,
and
had
given
rather
a
dry
catalogue
of
her
features
,
hair
,
and
height
,
but
<EOS>
Hester
,
almost
to
her
own
surprise
,
persevered
,
and
jerked
out
the
final
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
she
pretty
?
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
's
sallow
cheek
grew
deeper
by
two
or
three
shades
;
but
he
answered
with
a
tone
of
indifference
,
    
"
I
believe
some
folks
think
her
so
.
"
  
"
But
do
you
?
"
<EOS>
persevered
Hester
,
in
spite
of
her
being
aware
that
he
somehow
disliked
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
need
for
talking
o
'
<EOS>
such
things
,
"
he
answered
,
with
abrupt
displeasure
.
  
<EOS>
Hester
silenced
her
curiosity
from
that
time
.
<EOS>
But
her
heart
was
not
quite
at
ease
,
and
she
kept
on
wondering
whether
Philip
thought
his
little
cousin
pretty
until
she
saw
her
and
him
together
,
on
that
occasion
of
which
we
have
spoken
,
when
Sylvia
came
to
the
shop
to
buy
her
new
cloak
;
and
after
that
Hester
never
wondered
whether
Philip
thought
his
cousin
pretty
or
no
,
for
she
knew
quite
well
.
<EOS>
Bell
Robson
had
her
own
anxieties
on
the
subject
of
her
daughter
's
increasing
attractions
.
<EOS>
She
apprehended
the
dangers
consequent
upon
certain
facts
,
by
a
mental
process
more
akin
to
intuition
than
reason
.
<EOS>
She
was
uncomfortable
,
even
while
her
motherly
vanity
was
flattered
,
at
the
admiration
Sylvia
received
from
the
other
sex
.
<EOS>
This
admiration
was
made
evident
to
her
mother
in
many
ways
.
<EOS>
When
Sylvia
was
with
her
at
market
,
it
might
have
been
thought
that
the
doctors
had
prescribed
a
diet
of
butter
and
eggs
to
all
the
men
under
forty
in
Monkshaven
.
<EOS>
At
first
it
seemed
to
Mrs.
Robson
but
a
natural
tribute
to
the
superior
merit
of
her
farm
produce
;
but
by
degrees
she
perceived
that
if
Sylvia
remained
at
home
,
she
stood
no
better
chance
than
her
neighbours
of
an
early
sale
.
<EOS>
There
were
more
customers
than
formerly
for
the
fleeces
stored
in
the
wool
-
loft
;
comely
young
butchers
came
after
the
calf
almost
before
it
had
been
decided
to
sell
it
;
in
short
,
excuses
were
seldom
wanting
to
those
who
wished
to
see
the
beauty
of
Haytersbank
Farm
.
<EOS>
All
this
made
Bell
uncomfortable
,
though
she
could
hardly
have
told
what
she
dreaded
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
herself
seemed
unspoilt
by
it
as
far
as
her
home
relations
were
concerned
.
<EOS>
A
little
thoughtless
she
had
always
been
,
and
thoughtless
she
was
still
;
but
,
as
her
mother
had
often
said
,
"
Yo
'
canna
put
old
heads
on
young
shoulders
;
"
and
if
blamed
for
her
carelessness
by
her
parents
,
Sylvia
was
always
as
penitent
as
she
could
be
for
the
time
being
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
it
was
only
to
her
father
and
mother
that
she
remained
the
same
as
she
had
been
when
an
awkward
lassie
of
thirteen
.
<EOS>
Out
of
the
house
there
were
the
most
contradictory
opinions
of
her
,
especially
if
the
voices
of
women
were
to
be
listened
to
.
<EOS>
She
was
"
an
ill
-
favoured
,
overgrown
thing
"
;
"
just
as
bonny
as
the
first
rose
<EOS>
i
'
June
,
and
<EOS>
as
sweet
<EOS>
i
'
her
nature
as
t
'
honeysuckle
<EOS>
a
-
climbing
round
it
<EOS>
;
"
she
was
"
a
vixen
,
with
a
tongue
sharp
enough
to
make
yer
very
heart
bleed
;
"
she
was
"
just
a
bit
o
'
sunshine
<EOS>
wheriver
<EOS>
she
went
;
"
she
was
sulky
,
lively
,
witty
,
silent
,
affectionate
,
or
cold
-
hearted
,
according
to
the
person
who
spoke
about
her
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
her
peculiarity
seemed
to
be
this
 
that
every
one
who
knew
her
talked
about
her
either
in
praise
or
blame
;
in
church
,
or
in
market
,
she
unconsciously
attracted
attention
;
they
could
not
forget
her
presence
,
as
they
could
that
of
other
girls
perhaps
more
personally
attractive
.
<EOS>
Now
all
this
was
a
cause
of
anxiety
to
her
mother
,
who
began
to
feel
as
if
she
would
rather
have
had
her
child
passed
by
in
silence
than
so
much
noticed
.
<EOS>
Bell
's
opinion
was
,
that
it
was
creditable
to
a
woman
to
go
through
life
in
the
shadow
of
obscurity
,
 
never
named
except
in
connexion
with
good
housewifery
,
husband
,
or
children
.
<EOS>
Too
much
talking
about
a
girl
,
even
in
the
way
of
praise
,
disturbed
Mrs.
Robson
's
opinion
of
her
;
and
when
her
neighbours
told
her
how
her
own
daughter
was
admired
,
she
would
reply
coldly
,
"
She
's
just
well
enough
,
"
and
change
the
subject
of
conversation
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
quite
different
with
her
husband
.
<EOS>
To
his
looser
,
less
-
restrained
mind
,
it
was
agreeable
to
hear
of
,
and
still
more
to
see
,
the
attention
which
his
daughter
's
beauty
received
.
<EOS>
He
felt
it
as
reflecting
consequence
on
himself
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
troubled
his
mind
with
speculations
as
to
whether
he
himself
was
popular
,
still
less
whether
he
was
respected
.
<EOS>
He
was
pretty
welcome
wherever
he
went
,
as
a
jovial
good
-
natured
man
,
who
had
done
adventurous
and
illegal
things
in
his
youth
,
which
in
some
measure
entitled
him
to
speak
out
his
opinions
on
life
in
general
in
the
authoritative
manner
he
generally
used
;
but
,
of
the
two
,
he
preferred
consorting
with
younger
men
,
to
taking
a
sober
stand
of
respectability
with
the
elders
of
the
place
;
and
he
perceived
,
without
reasoning
upon
it
,
that
the
gay
daring
spirits
were
more
desirous
of
his
company
when
Sylvia
was
by
his
side
than
at
any
other
time
.
<EOS>
One
or
two
of
these
would
saunter
up
to
Haytersbank
on
a
Sunday
afternoon
,
and
lounge
round
his
fields
with
the
old
farmer
.
<EOS>
Bell
kept
herself
from
the
nap
which
had
been
her
weekly
solace
for
years
,
in
order
to
look
after
Sylvia
,
and
on
such
occasions
she
always
turned
as
cold
a
shoulder
to
the
visitors
as
her
sense
of
hospitality
and
of
duty
to
her
husband
would
permit
.
<EOS>
But
if
they
did
not
enter
the
house
,
old
Robson
would
always
have
Sylvia
with
him
when
he
went
the
round
of
his
land
.
<EOS>
Bell
could
see
them
from
the
upper
window
:
<EOS>
the
young
men
standing
in
the
attitudes
of
listeners
,
while
Daniel
laid
down
the
law
on
some
point
,
enforcing
his
words
by
pantomimic
actions
with
his
thick
stick
;
and
Sylvia
,
half
turning
away
as
if
from
some
too
admiring
gaze
,
was
possibly
picking
flowers
out
of
the
hedge
-
bank
.
<EOS>
These
Sunday
afternoon
strolls
were
the
plague
of
Bell
's
life
that
whole
summer
.
<EOS>
Then
it
took
as
much
of
artifice
as
was
in
the
simple
woman
's
nature
to
keep
Daniel
from
insisting
on
having
Sylvia
's
company
every
time
he
went
down
to
Monkshaven
.
<EOS>
And
here
,
again
,
came
a
perplexity
,
the
acknowledgement
of
which
in
distinct
thought
would
have
been
an
act
of
disloyalty
,
according
to
Bell
's
conscience
.
<EOS>
If
Sylvia
went
with
her
father
,
he
never
drank
to
excess
;
and
that
was
a
good
gain
to
health
at
any
rate
<EOS>
(
drinking
was
hardly
a
sin
against
morals
in
those
days
,
and
in
that
place
)
;
so
,
occasionally
,
she
was
allowed
to
accompany
him
to
Monkshaven
as
a
check
upon
his
folly
;
for
he
was
too
fond
and
proud
of
his
daughter
to
disgrace
her
by
any
open
excess
.
<EOS>
But
one
Sunday
afternoon
early
in
November
,
Philip
came
up
before
the
time
at
which
he
usually
paid
his
visits
.
<EOS>
He
looked
grave
and
pale
;
and
his
aunt
began
,
    
"
Why
,
lad
!
<EOS>
what
's
been
ado
?
<EOS>
Thou'rt
looking
as
peaked
and
pined
as
a
Methody
preacher
after
a
love
-
feast
,
when
he
's
talked
hisself
to
Death
's
door
.
<EOS>
Thee
dost
na
'
get
good
milk
enow
<EOS>
,
that
's
what
it
is
,
 
such
stuff
as
Monkshaven
folks
put
up
wi
'
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
aunt
;
I
'm
quite
well
.
<EOS>
Only
I
'm
a
bit
put
out
 
vexed
like
at
what
I
've
heerd
about
Sylvie
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
aunt
's
face
changed
immediately
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
whatten
folk
say
of
her
,
next
thing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
"
said
Philip
,
struck
by
the
difference
of
look
and
manner
in
his
aunt
,
and
subdued
by
seeing
how
instantly
she
took
alarm
.
<EOS>
"
It
were
only
my
uncle
;
 
he
should
na
'
take
a
girl
like
her
to
a
public
.
<EOS>
She
were
wi
'
him
at
t
'
"
Admiral
's
Head
"
upo
'
All
Souls
'
<EOS>
Day
 
<EOS>
that
were
all
.
<EOS>
There
were
many
a
one
there
beside
,
 
it
were
statute
fair
;
but
such
a
one
as
our
Sylvie
ought
not
to
be
cheapened
wi
'
t
'
rest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
took
her
there
,
did
he
?
"
<EOS>
said
Bell
,
in
severe
meditation
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
never
no
opinion
o
'
th
'
wenches
as
'll
set
theirselves
to
be
hired
for
servants
<EOS>
i
'
th
'
fair
;
they
're
a
bad
lot
,
as
can
not
find
places
for
theirselves
 
'bout
going
and
stannin
'
to
be
stared
at
by
folk
,
and
grinnin
'
wi
'
th
'
plough
-
lads
<EOS>
when
no
one
's
looking
;
it
's
a
bad
look
-
out
for
t
'
missus
as
takes
one
<EOS>
o
<EOS>
'
these
wenches
for
a
servant
;
and
dost
ta
mean
to
say
as
my
Sylvie
went
and
demeaned
hersel
'
to
dance
and
marlock
wi
'
a
'
th
'
fair
-
folk
at
th
'
"
Admiral
's
Head
?
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
no
,
she
did
na
'
dance
;
she
barely
set
foot
i
'
th
'
room
;
but
it
were
her
own
pride
as
saved
her
;
uncle
would
niver
ha
'
kept
her
from
it
,
for
he
had
fallen
in
wi
'
Hayley
o
'
Seaburn
and
one
or
two
others
,
and
they
were
having
a
glass
<EOS>
i
'
t
'
bar
,
and
Mrs.
Lawson
,
t
'
landlady
,
knew
how
there
was
them
who
would
come
and
dance
among
parish
'
prentices
if
need
were
,
just
to
get
a
word
or
a
look
wi
'
Sylvie
!
<EOS>
So
she
tempts
her
in
,
saying
that
the
room
were
all
smartened
and
fine
wi
'
flags
;
and
there
was
them
in
the
room
as
told
me
that
they
never
were
so
startled
as
when
they
saw
our
Sylvie
's
face
peeping
in
among
all
t
'
flustered
maids
and
men
,
rough
and
red
wi
'
weather
and
drink
;
and
Jem
Macbean
,
he
said
she
were
just
like
a
bit
o
'
apple
-
blossom
among
peonies
;
and
some
man
<EOS>
,
he
did
n't
know
who
,
went
up
and
spoke
to
her
;
an
'
either
at
that
,
or
at
some
o
'
t
'
words
she
heard
 
for
they
'd
got
a
good
way
on
afore
that
time
 
she
went
quite
white
and
mad
,
as
if
fire
were
coming
out
of
her
eyes
,
and
then
she
turned
red
and
left
the
room
,
for
all
t
'
landlady
tried
to
laugh
it
off
and
keep
her
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
be
down
to
Monkshaven
before
I
'm
a
day
older
,
and
tell
Margaret
Lawson
some
on
my
mind
as
she
'll
not
forget
in
a
hurry
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bell
moved
as
though
she
would
put
on
her
cloak
and
hood
there
and
then
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
it
's
not
in
reason
as
a
woman
<EOS>
i
'
that
line
o
'
life
should
n't
try
to
make
her
house
agreeable
,
"
said
Philip
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
wi
'
my
wench
,
"
said
Bell
,
in
a
determined
voice
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
's
information
had
made
a
deeper
impression
on
his
aunt
than
he
intended
.
<EOS>
He
himself
had
been
annoyed
more
at
the
idea
that
Sylvia
would
be
spoken
of
as
having
been
at
a
rough
piece
of
rustic
gaiety
 
a
yearly
festival
for
the
lower
classes
of
Yorkshire
servants
,
out
-
door
as
well
as
in
-
door
 
than
at
the
affair
itself
,
for
he
had
learnt
from
his
informant
how
instantaneous
her
appearance
had
been
.
<EOS>
He
stood
watching
his
aunt
's
troubled
face
,
and
almost
wishing
that
he
had
not
spoken
.
<EOS>
At
last
she
heaved
a
deep
sigh
,
and
stirring
the
fire
,
as
if
by
this
little
household
occupation
to
compose
her
mind
,
she
said
    
"
It
's
a
pity
as
wenches
are
n't
lads
,
or
married
folk
.
<EOS>
I
could
ha
'
wished
 
<EOS>
but
it
were
the
Lord
's
will
 
<EOS>
It
would
ha
'
been
summut
to
look
to
,
if
she
'd
had
a
brother
.
<EOS>
My
master
is
so
full
on
his
own
thoughts
<EOS>
,
yo
'
see
,
he
's
no
mind
left
for
thinking
on
her
,
<EOS>
what
wi
'
th
'
oats
,
and
th
'
wool
,
and
th
'
young
colt
,
and
his
venture
<EOS>
i
'
th
'
<EOS>
_
Lucky
Mary
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
really
believed
her
husband
to
have
the
serious
and
important
occupation
for
his
mind
that
she
had
been
taught
to
consider
befitting
the
superior
intellect
of
the
masculine
gender
;
she
would
have
taxed
herself
severely
,
if
,
even
in
thought
,
she
had
blamed
him
,
and
Philip
respected
her
feelings
too
much
to
say
that
Sylvia
's
father
ought
to
look
after
her
more
closely
if
he
made
such
a
pretty
creature
so
constantly
his
companion
;
yet
some
such
speech
was
only
just
pent
within
Philip
's
closed
lips
.
<EOS>
Again
his
aunt
spoke
    
"
I
used
to
think
as
she
and
yo
'
might
fancy
one
another
,
but
thou'rt
<EOS>
too
old
-
fashioned
like
for
her
;
ye
would
na
'
suit
;
and
it
's
as
well
,
for
now
I
can
say
to
thee
,
that
I
would
take
it
very
kindly
if
thou
<EOS>
would'st
look
after
her
a
bit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
's
countenance
fell
into
gloom
.
<EOS>
He
had
to
gulp
down
certain
feelings
before
he
could
make
answer
with
discretion
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
look
after
her
,
and
me
tied
to
the
shop
more
and
more
every
day
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
send
her
on
a
bit
of
an
errand
to
Foster
's
,
and
then
,
for
sure
,
yo
'
might
keep
an
eye
upon
her
when
she
's
in
th
'
town
;
and
just
walk
a
bit
way
with
her
when
she
's
in
th
'
street
,
and
keep
t
'
other
fellows
off
her
 
Ned
Simpson
,
t
'
butcher
,
in
'
special
,
for
folks
do
say
he
means
no
good
by
any
girl
he
goes
wi
'
 
<EOS>
and
I
'll
ask
father
to
leave
her
a
bit
more
wi
'
me
.
<EOS>
They
're
coming
down
th
'
brow
,
and
Ned
Simpson
wi
'
them
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Philip
,
I
look
to
thee
to
do
a
brother
's
part
by

"
  
<EOS>
The
door
opened
,
and
the
coarse
strong
voice
of
Simpson
made
itself
heard
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
stout
man
,
comely
enough
as
to
form
and
feature
,
but
with
a
depth
of
colour
in
his
face
that
betokened
the
coming
on
of
the
habits
of
the
sot
.
<EOS>
His
Sunday
hat
was
in
his
hand
,
and
he
smoothed
the
long
nap
of
it
,
as
he
said
,
with
a
mixture
of
shyness
and
familiarity
    
"

<EOS>
Yo'r
measter
is
fain
that
I
should

no

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
passed
quickly
through
the
house
-
place
,
and
went
upstairs
without
speaking
to
her
cousin
Philip
or
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
He
sat
on
,
disliking
the
visitor
,
and
almost
disliking
his
hospitable
uncle
for
having
brought
Simpson
into
the
house
,
sympathizing
with
his
aunt
in
the
spirit
which
prompted
her
curt
answers
,
and
in
the
intervals
of
all
these
feelings
wondering
what
ground
she
had
for
speaking
as
if
she
had
now
given
up
all
thought
of
Sylvia
and
him
ever
being
married
,
and
in
what
way
he
was
too
"
old
-
fashioned
.
"
  
<EOS>
Robson
would
gladly
have
persuaded
Philip
to
join
him
and
Simpson
in
their
drink
,
but
Philip
was
in
no
sociable
mood
,
and
sate
a
little
aloof
,
watching
the
staircase
down
which
sooner
or
later
Sylvia
must
come
;
for
,
as
perhaps
has
been
already
said
,
the
stairs
went
up
straight
out
of
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
And
at
length
his
yearning
watch
was
rewarded
;
first
,
the
little
pointed
toe
came
daintily
in
sight
,
then
the
trim
ankle
in
the
tight
blue
stocking
,
the
wool
of
which
was
spun
and
the
web
of
which
was
knitted
by
her
mother
's
careful
hands
;
then
the
full
brown
stuff
petticoat
,
the
arm
holding
the
petticoat
back
in
decent
folds
,
so
as
not
to
encumber
the
descending
feet
;
the
slender
neck
and
shoulders
hidden
under
the
folded
square
of
fresh
white
muslin
;
the
crowning
beauty
of
the
soft
innocent
face
radiant
in
colour
,
and
with
the
light
brown
curls
clustering
around
.
<EOS>
She
made
her
way
quickly
to
Philip
's
side
;
how
his
heart
beat
at
her
approach
!
<EOS>
and
even
more
when
she
entered
into
a
low
-
voiced
_
tete
-
a
-
tete
_
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
n't
he
gone
yet
?
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
abide
him
;
I
could
ha
'
pinched
father
when
he
asked
him
for
t
'
come
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Maybe
,
he
'll
not
stay
long
,
"
said
Philip
,
hardly
understanding
the
meaning
of
what
he
said
,
so
sweet
was
it
to
have
her
making
her
whispered
confidences
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
But
Simpson
was
not
going
to
let
her
alone
in
the
dark
corner
between
the
door
and
the
window
.
<EOS>
He
began
paying
her
some
coarse
country
compliments
 
too
strong
in
their
direct
flattery
for
even
her
father
's
taste
,
more
especially
as
he
saw
by
his
wife
's
set
lips
and
frowning
brow
how
much
she
disapproved
of
their
visitor
's
style
of
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
measter
,
leave
t
'
lass
alone
;
she
's
set
up
enough
a'ready
,
<EOS>
her
mother
makes
such
a
deal
on
her
.
<EOS>
Yo
'
an
'
me
's
men
for
sensible
talk
at
our
time
<EOS>
o
'
life
.
<EOS>
An
'
,
as
I
was
saying
,
t
'
horse
was
a
weaver
if
iver
one
was
,
as
any
one
could
ha
'
told
as
had
come
within
a
mile
on
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
in
this
way
the
old
farmer
and
the
bluff
butcher
chatted
on
about
horses
,
while
Philip
and
Sylvia
sate
together
,
he
turning
over
all
manner
of
hopes
and
projects
for
the
future
,
in
spite
of
his
aunt
's
opinion
that
he
was
too
"
old
-
fashioned
"
for
her
dainty
,
blooming
daughter
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
too
,
Mrs.
Robson
saw
some
reason
for
changing
her
mind
on
this
head
as
she
watched
Sylvia
this
night
,
for
she
accompanied
Philip
to
the
door
,
when
the
time
came
for
him
to
start
homewards
,
and
bade
him
"
good
-
night
"
with
unusual
fervour
,
adding
    
"
Thou'st
been
a
deal
o
'
comfort
to
me
,
lad
 
a'most
as
one
as
if
thou
wert
<EOS>
a
child
o
'
<EOS>
my
own
,
as
at
times
I
could
welly
think
thou
art
to
be
.
<EOS>
Anyways
,
I
trust
to
thee
to
look
after
the
lile
lass
,
as
has
no
brother
to
guide
her
among
men
 
and
men
's
very
kittle
for
a
woman
to
deal
wi
;
but
if
thou'lt
have
an
eye
on
whom
she
consorts
wi
'
,
my
mind
'll
be
easier
.
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
's
heart
beat
fast
,
but
his
voice
was
as
calm
as
usual
when
he
replied
    
<EOS>
"
I
'd
just
keep
her
a
bit
aloof
from
Monkshaven
folks
;
a
lass
is
always
the
more
thought
on
for
being
chary
of
herself
;
and
as
for
t
'
rest
,
I
'll
have
an
eye
to
the
folks
she
goes
among
,
and
if
I
see
that
they
do
n't
befit
her
,
I
'll
just
give
her
a
warning
,
for
she
's
not
one
to
like
such
chaps
as
yon
Simpson
there
;
she
can
see
what
's
becoming
in
a
man
to
say
to
a
lass
,
and
what
's
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
set
out
on
his
two
-
mile
walk
home
with
a
tumult
of
happiness
in
his
heart
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
often
carried
away
by
delusions
of
his
own
creating
;
to
-
night
he
thought
he
had
good
ground
for
believing
that
by
patient
self
-
restraint
he
might
win
Sylvia
's
love
.
<EOS>
A
year
ago
he
had
nearly
earned
her
dislike
by
obtruding
upon
her
looks
and
<EOS>
words
betokening
his
passionate
love
.
<EOS>
He
alarmed
her
girlish
coyness
,
as
well
as
wearied
her
with
the
wish
he
had
then
felt
that
she
should
take
an
interest
in
his
pursuits
.
<EOS>
But
,
with
unusual
wisdom
,
he
had
perceived
his
mistake
;
it
was
many
months
now
since
he
had
betrayed
,
by
word
or
look
,
that
she
was
anything
more
to
him
than
a
little
cousin
to
be
cared
for
and
protected
when
need
was
.
<EOS>
The
consequence
was
that
she
had
become
tamed
,
just
as
a
wild
animal
is
tamed
;
he
had
remained
tranquil
and
impassive
,
almost
as
if
he
did
not
perceive
her
shy
advances
towards
friendliness
.
<EOS>
These
advances
were
made
by
her
after
the
lessons
had
ceased
.
<EOS>
She
was
afraid
lest
he
was
displeased
with
her
behaviour
in
rejecting
his
instructions
,
and
was
not
easy
till
she
was
at
peace
with
him
;
and
now
,
to
all
appearance
,
he
and
she
were
perfect
friends
,
but
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
In
his
absence
she
would
not
allow
her
young
companions
to
laugh
at
his
grave
sobriety
of
character
,
and
somewhat
prim
demeanour
;
she
would
even
go
against
her
conscience
,
and
deny
that
she
perceived
any
peculiarity
.
<EOS>
When
she
wanted
it
,
she
sought
his
advice
on
such
small
subjects
as
came
up
in
her
daily
life
;
and
she
tried
not
to
show
signs
of
weariness
when
he
used
more
words
 
and
more
difficult
words
 
than
were
necessary
to
convey
his
ideas
.
<EOS>
But
her
ideal
husband
was
different
from
Philip
in
every
point
,
the
two
images
never
for
an
instant
merged
into
one
.
<EOS>
To
Philip
she
was
the
only
woman
in
the
world
;
it
was
the
one
subject
on
which
he
dared
not
consider
,
for
fear
that
both
conscience
and
judgment
should
decide
against
him
,
and
that
he
should
be
convinced
against
his
will
that
she
was
an
unfit
mate
for
him
,
that
she
never
would
be
his
,
and
that
it
was
waste
of
time
and
life
to
keep
her
shrined
in
the
dearest
sanctuary
of
his
being
,
to
the
exclusion
of
all
the
serious
and
religious
aims
which
,
in
any
other
case
,
he
would
have
been
the
first
to
acknowledge
as
the
object
he
ought
to
pursue
.
<EOS>
For
he
had
been
brought
up
among
the
Quakers
,
and
shared
in
their
austere
distrust
of
a
self
-
seeking
spirit
;
yet
what
else
but
self
-
seeking
was
his
passionate
prayer
,
"
<EOS>
Give
me
Sylvia
,
or
else
,
I
die
?
"
<EOS>
No
other
vision
had
ever
crossed
his
masculine
fancy
for
a
moment
;
his
was
a
rare
and
constant
love
that
deserved
a
better
fate
than
it
met
with
.
<EOS>
At
this
time
his
hopes
were
high
,
as
I
have
said
,
not
merely
as
to
the
growth
of
Sylvia
's
feelings
towards
him
,
but
as
to
the
probability
of
his
soon
being
in
a
position
to
place
her
in
such
comfort
,
as
his
wife
,
as
she
had
never
enjoyed
before
.
  
<EOS>
For
the
brothers
Foster
were
thinking
of
retiring
from
business
,
and
relinquishing
the
shop
to
their
two
shopmen
,
Philip
Hepburn
and
William
Coulson
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
it
was
only
by
looking
back
for
a
few
months
,
and
noticing
chance
expressions
and
small
indications
,
that
this
intention
of
theirs
could
be
discovered
.
<EOS>
But
every
step
they
took
tended
this
way
,
and
Philip
knew
their
usual
practice
of
deliberation
too
well
to
feel
in
the
least
impatient
for
the
quicker
progress
of
the
end
which
he
saw
steadily
approaching
.
<EOS>
The
whole
atmosphere
of
life
among
the
Friends
at
this
date
partook
of
this
character
of
self
-
repression
,
and
both
Coulson
and
Hepburn
shared
in
it
.
<EOS>
Coulson
was
just
as
much
aware
of
the
prospect
opening
before
him
as
Hepburn
;
but
they
never
spoke
together
on
the
subject
,
although
their
mutual
knowledge
might
be
occasionally
implied
in
their
conversation
on
their
future
lives
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
the
Fosters
were
imparting
more
of
the
background
of
their
business
to
their
successors
.
<EOS>
For
the
present
,
at
least
,
the
brothers
meant
to
retain
an
interest
in
the
shop
,
even
after
they
had
given
up
the
active
management
;
and
they
sometimes
thought
of
setting
up
a
separate
establishment
as
bankers
.
<EOS>
The
separation
of
the
business
,
 
the
introduction
of
their
shopmen
to
the
distant
manufacturers
who
furnished
their
goods
(
in
those
days
the
system
of
"
travellers
"
was
not
so
widely
organized
as
it
is
at
present
)
,
 
all
these
steps
were
in
gradual
progress
;
and
already
Philip
saw
himself
in
imagination
in
the
dignified
position
of
joint
master
of
the
principal
shop
in
Monkshaven
,
with
Sylvia
installed
as
his
wife
,
with
certainly
a
silk
gown
,
and
possibly
a
gig
at
her
disposal
.
<EOS>
In
all
Philip
's
visions
of
future
prosperity
,
it
was
Sylvia
who
was
to
be
aggrandized
by
them
;
his
own
life
was
to
be
spent
as
it
was
now
,
pretty
much
between
the
four
shop
walls
.
    
<EOS>
NEW
YEAR
'S
FETE
  
<EOS>
All
this
enlargement
of
interest
in
the
shop
occupied
Philip
fully
for
some
months
after
the
period
referred
to
in
the
preceding
chapter
.
<EOS>
Remembering
his
last
conversation
with
his
aunt
,
he
might
have
been
uneasy
at
his
inability
to
perform
his
promise
and
look
after
his
pretty
cousin
,
but
that
about
the
middle
of
November
Bell
Robson
had
fallen
ill
of
a
rheumatic
fever
,
and
that
her
daughter
had
been
entirely
absorbed
in
nursing
her
.
<EOS>
No
thought
of
company
or
gaiety
was
in
Sylvia
's
mind
as
long
as
her
mother
's
illness
lasted
;
vehement
in
all
her
feelings
,
she
discovered
in
the
dread
of
losing
her
mother
how
passionately
she
was
attached
to
her
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
<EOS>
she
had
supposed
,
as
children
so
often
do
,
that
her
parents
would
live
for
ever
;
and
now
when
it
was
a
question
of
days
,
whether
by
that
time
the
following
week
her
mother
might
not
be
buried
out
of
her
sight
for
ever
,
she
clung
to
every
semblance
of
service
to
be
rendered
,
or
affection
shown
,
as
if
she
hoped
to
condense
the
love
and
care
of
years
into
the
few
days
only
that
might
remain
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Robson
lingered
on
,
began
slowly
to
recover
,
and
before
Christmas
was
again
sitting
by
the
fireside
in
the
house
-
place
,
wan
and
pulled
down
,
muffled
up
with
shawls
and
blankets
,
but
still
there
once
more
,
where
not
long
before
Sylvia
had
scarcely
expected
to
see
her
again
.
<EOS>
Philip
came
up
that
evening
and
found
Sylvia
in
wild
spirits
.
<EOS>
She
thought
that
everything
was
done
,
now
that
her
mother
had
once
come
downstairs
again
;
she
laughed
with
glee
;
she
kissed
her
mother
;
she
shook
hands
with
Philip
,
she
almost
submitted
to
a
speech
of
more
than
usual
tenderness
from
him
;
but
,
in
the
midst
of
his
words
,
her
mother
's
pillows
wanted
arranging
<EOS>
and
she
went
to
her
chair
,
paying
no
more
heed
to
his
words
than
if
they
had
been
addressed
to
the
cat
,
that
lying
on
the
invalid
's
knee
was
purring
out
her
welcome
to
the
weak
hand
feebly
stroking
her
back
.
<EOS>
Robson
himself
soon
came
in
,
looking
older
and
more
subdued
since
Philip
had
seen
him
last
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
urgent
that
his
wife
should
have
some
spirits
and
water
;
but
on
her
refusal
,
almost
as
if
she
loathed
the
thought
of
the
smell
,
he
contented
himself
with
sharing
her
tea
,
though
he
kept
abusing
the
beverage
as
"
washing
the
heart
out
of
a
man
,
"
and
attributing
all
the
degeneracy
of
the
world
,
growing
up
about
him
in
his
old
age
,
to
the
drinking
of
such
slop
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
his
little
self
-
sacrifice
put
him
in
an
unusually
good
temper
;
and
,
mingled
with
his
real
gladness
at
having
his
wife
once
more
on
the
way
to
recovery
,
brought
back
some
of
the
old
charm
of
tenderness
combined
with
light
-
heartedness
,
which
had
won
the
sober
Isabella
Preston
long
ago
.
<EOS>
He
sat
by
her
side
,
holding
her
hand
,
and
talking
of
old
times
to
the
young
couple
opposite
;
of
his
adventures
and
escapes
,
and
how
he
had
won
his
wife
.
<EOS>
She
,
faintly
smiling
at
the
remembrance
of
those
days
,
yet
half
-
ashamed
at
having
the
little
details
of
her
courtship
revealed
,
from
time
to
time
kept
saying
,
    
"
For
shame
wi
'
thee
,

"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
's
colour
came
,
her
eyes
brightened
,
she
would
have
liked
to
go
;
but
the
thought
of
her
mother
came
across
her
,
and
her
features
fell
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
's
eye
caught
the
look
and
the
change
,
and
knew
what
both
meant
as
well
as
if
Sylvia
had
spoken
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thursday

said
she
.
<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
but
weakly
yet
,
"
said
Philip
shortly
;
he
did
not
intend
to
say
it
,
but
the
words
seemed
to
come
out
in
spite
of
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
said
as
our
lass
should
come
,
God
willin
'
,
if
she
only
came
and
went

<EOS>
an
'

So

She
said
her

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
as
I
can
go
,
"
said
Philip
,
secretly
pleased
to
know
that
he
had
the
opportunity
in
his
power
;
"
I
'm
half
bound
to
go
Wi
'
Hester
Rose
and
her
mother
to
t
'
watch

night

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
Hester
a
Methodee
?
"
asked
Sylvia
in
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
she
's
neither
a
Methodee
,
nor
a
Friend
,
nor
a
Church
person
;
but
she
's
a
turn
for
serious
things
,
choose
wherever
they
're
found
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
"
said
good
-
natured
farmer
Robson
,
only
seeing
the
surface
of
things
,
"
a'll
make
shift
to
fetch
Sylvie
<EOS>
back
fra
'
t
'
merry
-
making
,
and
thee
an
'
thy
young
woman
can
go
to
t
'
prayer
-
makin
'
;
it
's
every
man
to
his
taste
,
say
I.
"
  
<EOS>
But
in
spite
of
his
half
-
promise
,
nay
against
his
natural
inclination
,
Philip
was
lured
to
the
Corneys
'
by
the
thought
of
meeting
Sylvia
,
of
watching
her
and
exulting
in
her
superiority
in
pretty
looks
and
ways
to
all
the
other
girls
likely
to
be
assembled
.
<EOS>
Besides
(
he
told
his
conscience
)
<EOS>
he
was
pledged
to
his
aunt
to
watch
over
Sylvia
like
a
brother
.
<EOS>
So
in
the
interval
before
New
Year
's
Eve
,
he
silently
revelled
as
much
as
any
young
girl
in
the
anticipation
of
the
happy
coming
time
.
  
<EOS>
At
this
hour
,
all
the
actors
in
this
story
having
played
out
their
parts
and
gone
to
their
rest
,
there
is
something
touching
in
recording
the
futile
efforts
made
by
Philip
to
win
from
Sylvia
the
love
he
yearned
for
.
<EOS>
But
,
at
the
time
,
any
one
who
had
watched
him
might
have
been
amused
to
see
the
grave
,
awkward
,
plain
young
man
studying
patterns
and
colours
for
a
new
waistcoat
,
with
his
head
a
little
on
one
side
,
after
the
meditative
manner
common
to
those
who
are
choosing
a
new
article
of
dress
.
<EOS>
They
might
have
smiled
could
they
have
read
in
his
imagination
the
frequent
rehearsals
of
the
coming
evening
,
when
he
and
she
should
each
be
dressed
in
their
gala
attire
,
to
spend
a
few
hours
under
a
bright
,
festive
aspect
,
among
people
whose
company
would
oblige
them
to
assume
a
new
demeanour
towards
each
other
,
not
so
familiar
as
their
every
-
day
manner
,
but
allowing
more
scope
for
the
expression
of
rustic
gallantry
.
<EOS>
Philip
had
so
seldom
been
to
anything
of
the
kind
,
that
,
even
had
Sylvia
not
been
going
,
he
would
have
felt
a
kind
of
shy
excitement
at
the
prospect
of
anything
so
unusual
.
<EOS>
But
,
indeed
,
if
Sylvia
had
not
been
going
,
it
is
very
probable
that
Philip
's
rigid
conscience
might
have
been
aroused
to
the
question
whether
such
parties
did
not
savour
too
much
of
the
world
for
him
to
form
one
in
them
.
  
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
however
,
the
facts
to
him
were
simply
these
.
<EOS>
He
was
going
and
she
was
going
.
<EOS>
The
day
before
,
he
had
hurried
off
to
Haytersbank
Farm
with
a
small
paper
parcel
in
his
pocket
 
a
ribbon
with
a
little
briar
-
rose
pattern
running
upon
it
for
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
first
thing
he
had
ever
ventured
to
give
her
 
the
first
thing
of
the
kind
<EOS>
would
,
perhaps
,
be
more
accurate
;
for
when
he
had
first
begun
to
teach
her
any
lessons
,
he
had
given
her
Mavor
's
Spelling
-
book
,
but
that
he
might
have
done
,
out
of
zeal
for
knowledge
,
to
any
dunce
of
a
little
girl
of
his
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
This
ribbon
was
quite
a
different
kind
of
present
;
he
touched
it
tenderly
,
as
if
he
were
caressing
it
,
when
he
thought
of
her
wearing
it
;
the
briar
-
rose
(
sweetness
and
thorns
)
seemed
to
be
the
very
flower
for
her
;
the
soft
,
green
ground
on
which
the
pink
and
brown
pattern
ran
,
was
just
the
colour
to
show
off
her
complexion
.
<EOS>
And
she
would
in
a
way
belong
to
him
:
her
cousin
,
her
mentor
,
her
chaperon
,
her
lover
!
<EOS>
While
others
only
admired
,
he
might
hope
to
appropriate
;
for
of
late
they
had
been
such
happy
friends
!
<EOS>
Her
mother
approved
of
him
,
her
father
liked
him
.
<EOS>
A
few
months
,
perhaps
only
a
few
weeks
more
of
self
-
restraint
,
<EOS>
and
then
he
might
go
and
speak
openly
of
his
wishes
,
and
what
he
had
to
offer
.
<EOS>
For
he
had
resolved
,
with
the
quiet
force
of
his
character
,
to
wait
until
all
was
finally
settled
between
him
and
his
masters
,
before
he
declared
himself
to
either
Sylvia
or
her
parents
.
<EOS>
The
interval
was
spent
in
patient
,
silent
endeavours
to
recommend
himself
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
to
give
his
ribbon
to
his
aunt
in
charge
for
Sylvia
,
and
that
was
a
disappointment
to
his
fancy
,
although
he
tried
to
reason
himself
into
thinking
that
it
was
better
so
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
time
to
wait
for
her
return
from
some
errand
on
which
she
had
gone
,
for
he
was
daily
more
and
more
occupied
with
the
affairs
of
the
shop
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
made
many
a
promise
to
her
mother
,
and
more
to
herself
,
that
she
would
not
stay
late
at
the
party
,
but
she
might
go
as
early
as
she
liked
;
and
before
the
December
daylight
had
faded
away
,
Sylvia
presented
herself
at
the
Corneys
'
.
<EOS>
She
was
to
come
early
in
order
to
help
to
set
out
the
supper
,
which
was
arranged
in
the
large
old
flagged
parlour
,
which
served
as
best
bed
-
room
as
well
.
<EOS>
It
opened
out
of
the
house
-
place
,
and
was
the
sacred
room
of
the
house
,
as
chambers
of
a
similar
description
are
still
considered
in
retired
farmhouses
in
the
north
of
England
.
<EOS>
They
are
used
on
occasions
like
the
one
now
described
for
purposes
of
hospitality
;
but
in
the
state
bed
,
overshadowing
so
large
a
portion
of
the
floor
,
the
births
and
,
as
far
as
may
be
,
the
deaths
,
of
the
household
take
place
.
<EOS>
At
the
Corneys
'
,
the
united
efforts
of
some
former
generation
of
the
family
had
produced
patchwork
curtains
and
coverlet
;
and
patchwork
was
patchwork
in
those
days
,
before
the
early
Yates
and
Peels
had
found
out
the
secret
of
printing
the
parsley
-
leaf
.
<EOS>
Scraps
of
costly
Indian
chintzes
and
palempours
were
intermixed
with
commoner
black
and
red
calico
in
minute
hexagons
;
and
the
variety
of
patterns
served
for
the
useful
purpose
of
promoting
conversation
as
well
as
the
more
obvious
one
of
displaying
the
work
-
woman
's
taste
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
,
for
instance
,
began
at
once
to
her
old
friend
,
Molly
Brunton
,
who
had
accompanied
her
into
this
chamber
to
take
off
her
hat
and
cloak
,
with
a
remark
on
one
of
the
chintzes
.
<EOS>
Stooping
over
the
counterpane
,
with
a
face
into
which
the
flush
would
come
whether
or
<EOS>
no
,
she
said
to
Molly
,
    
"
<EOS>
Dear
!
<EOS>
I
never
seed
this
one
afore
 
<EOS>
this
 
for
all
t
'
world
like
th
'
eyes
in
a
peacock
's
tail
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thou
's
seen
it
many
a
time
and
oft
,
lass
.
<EOS>
But
were
n't
thou
surprised
to
find
Charley
here
?
<EOS>
We
picked
him
up
at
Shields
,
quite
by
surprise
like
;
and
when
Brunton
and
me
said
as
we
was
comin
'
here
,
nought
would
serve
him
but
comin
'
with
us
,
for
t
'
see
t
'
new
year
in
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
pity
as
your
mother
's
ta'en
this
time
for
t
'
fall
ill
and
want
yo
'
back
so
early
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
had
taken
off
her
hat
and
cloak
by
this
time
,
and
began
to
help
Molly
and
a
younger
unmarried
sister
in
laying
out
the
substantial
supper
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
,
"
continued
Mrs.
Brunton
;
"
stick
a
bit
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
holly
<EOS>
i
'
yon
pig
's
mouth
<EOS>
,
that
's
the
way
we
do
things
<EOS>
i
'
Newcassel
<EOS>
;
but
folks
is
so
behindhand
in
Monkshaven
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
fine
thing
to
live
in
a
large
town
,
Sylvia
;
an
'
if
yo're
looking
out
for
a
husband
,
I
'd
advise
yo
'
to
tak
'
one
as
lives
in
a
town
.
<EOS>
I
feel
as
if
I
were
buried
alive
comin
'
back
here
,
<EOS>
such
an
out
-
o
'
 
t
'
 
way
place
after
t
'
Side
,
wheere
there
's
many
a
hundred
carts
and
carriages
<EOS>
goes
past
in
a
day
.
<EOS>
I
've
a
great
mind
for
t
'
tak
yo
'
two
lassies
back
wi
'
me
,
and
let
yo
'
see
a
bit
o
'
t
'
world
;
may
-
be
,
I
may
yet
.
  
<EOS>
Her
sister
Bessy
looked
much
pleased
with
this
plan
,
but
Sylvia
was
rather
inclined
to
take
offence
at
Molly
's
patronizing
ways
,
and
replied
,
    
<EOS>
"
I
'm
none
so
fond
o
'
noise
and
bustle
;
why
,
yo'll
not
be
able
to
hear
yoursels
<EOS>
speak
wi
'
all
them
carts
and
carriages
.
<EOS>
I
'd
rayther
bide
at
home
;
let
alone
that
mother
ca
n't
spare
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
,
perhaps
,
a
rather
ungracious
way
of
answering
Molly
Brunton
's
speech
,
and
so
she
felt
it
to
be
,
although
her
invitation
had
been
none
of
the
most
courteously
worded
.
<EOS>
She
irritated
Sylvia
still
further
by
repeating
her
last
words
,
    
'
<EOS>
"
Mother
ca
n't
spare
me
;
"
why

mother
'll
have
to
spare
thee
sometime

when

<EOS>
"
I

said
Sylvia
;
"
and

<EOS>
Eh

what
a

it

<EOS>
How

laugh
when
I

Brunton
's
a

for
laughin

.
<EOS>
It
's
a
great
thing
to
have
got
such
a
merry
man
for
a
husband
.
<EOS>
Why
!
<EOS>
he
has
his
joke
for
every
one
as
comes
into

shop

he
'll
ha

something
funny

"
  
<EOS>
Bessy
saw
that
Sylvia
was
annoyed
,
and
,
with
more
delicacy
than
her
sister
,
she
tried
to
turn
the
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
pretty
ribbon
in
thy
hair
,
Sylvia
;
I
'd
like
to
have
one

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I

what
I

about

"
replied
Mrs.
Brunton
,
with
a
toss
of
her
married
head
.
  
<EOS>
Bessy
resumed
her
inquiry
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
there
any
more
to
be
had
wheere
that
come
fra
'
,
Sylvia

"
  
<EOS>
"
I

replied
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
"
It

fra

and
yo
'
can
ask
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
might
it
cost

"
said
Betsy
,
fingering
an
end
of
it
to
test
its
quality
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't

said
Sylvia
,
"

"
  
<EOS>
"

said
Molly
;

to

"
asked
the
unscrupulous
,
if
good
-
natured
Molly
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
cousin
Philip
,
him
as
is
shopman
at
Foster
's
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
innocently
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
far
too
good
an
opportunity
for
the
exercise
of
Molly
's
kind
of
wit
for
her
to
pass
over
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
oh
!
<EOS>
our
cousin
Philip
,
is
it
?
<EOS>
and
he
'll
not
be
living
so
far
away
from
your
mother

<EOS>
I
've
no

<EOS>
be
a

to
put

<EOS>
He
's
a
coming

night

is
n't
he

Bessy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
yo
'
would
n't
talk
so
,
Molly
,
"
said
Sylvia
;
<EOS>
"
me
and
Philip
is
good
enough
friends
,
but
we
niver

)
<EOS>
That
way
,
"
continued
Molly
,
in
the
manner
that
annoyed
Sylvia
so
much
,
repeating
her
words
as
if
for
the
purpose
of
laughing
at
them
.
'
<EOS>
"
That
way
?
"
and
pray
what
is
t
'
way
yo're
speaking
on
?
<EOS>
I
niver
said
nought
about
marrying
<EOS>
,
did
I
,
<EOS>
that
yo
'
need
look
so
red
and
shamefaced
about
yo'r
cousin
Philip

<EOS>
But
,
as
Brunton
says
,
if
t
'
cap
fits
yo
'
,
put
it
on
.
<EOS>
I
'm
glad

for
as
I

an

yo'r

Sylvia

me
into
a
secret
,
as
I
'd
some
glimpses
on
<EOS>
afore
<EOS>
I
was

.
"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
secretly
determined
not
to
speak
a
word
more
to
Philip
than
she
could
help
,
and
wondered
how
she
could
ever
have
liked
Molly
at
all
,
much
less
have
made
a
companion
of
her
.
<EOS>
The
table
was
now
laid
out
,
and
nothing
remained
but
to
criticize
the
arrangement
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
Bessy
was
full
of
admiration
.
  
<EOS>
"
Theere
,
Molly
!
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yo

niver

there
'll

beside
pies
and
custards
.
<EOS>
I
've
eaten
no
dinner
these
two
days
for
thinking
on
'
t
;
it
's
been
a
weary
burden
on
my
mind
,
but
it
's
off
now
<EOS>
I
see
how
well
it
looks
.
<EOS>
I
told
mother
not
to
come
near
it
till
we
'd
spread
it
all
out
,
and
now
I
'll
go
fetch
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bessy
ran
off
into
the
house
-
place
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
well
enough
in
a
country
kind
o
'
way
,
"
said
Molly
,
with
the
faint
approbation
of
condescension
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
I
'd
thought
on
,
I
'd
ha
'
brought
'em
down
a
beast
or
two
done
<EOS>
i
'
sponge
-
cake
,
wi
'
currants
for
his
eyes
to
give
t
'
table
an
air
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
door
was
opened
,
and
Bessy
came
in
smiling
and
blushing
with
proud
pleasure
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
followed
her
on
tip
-
toe
,
smoothing
down
her
apron
,
and
with
her
voice
subdued
to
a
whisper
:
    
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
my
lass
,
it
_
is
_
fine
!
<EOS>
But
dunnot
mak
'
an
ado
about
it
,
let
'em
think
it
's
just
our
common
way
.
<EOS>
If
any
one
says
aught
about
how
good
t

vittle
is

tak

<EOS>
it
calm
,
and
say

<EOS>
i

a

and
think

more
on

<EOS>
Sylvie
,
I
'm
much
beholden
<EOS>
t
'
ye
for
comin
'
so
early
,
and
helpin
'
t
'
lasses
,
but
<EOS>
yo
'
mun
come
in
t

house
-
place
now
,
t
'
folks

gatherin
'
,
an
'
yo'r
cousin
's
been
asking
after
yo
'
a'ready
.
"
  
<EOS>
Molly
gave
her
a
nudge
,
which
made
Sylvia
's
face
go
all
aflame
with
angry
embarrassment
.
<EOS>
She
was
conscious
that
the
watching
which
Molly
had
threatened
her
with
began
directly
;
for
Molly
went
up
to
her
husband
,
and
whispered
something
to
him
which
set
him
off
in
a
chuckling
laugh
,
and
Sylvia
was
aware
that
his
eyes
followed
her
about
with
knowing
<EOS>
looks
all
the
evening
.
<EOS>
She
would
hardly
speak
to
Philip
,
and
pretended
not
to
see
his
outstretched
hand
,
but
passed
on
to
the
chimney
-
corner
,
and
tried
to
shelter
herself
behind
the
broad
back
of
farmer
Corney
,
who
had
no
notion
of
relinquishing
his
customary
place
for
all
the
young
people
who
ever
came
to
the
house
,
 
or
for
any
old
people
either
,
for
that
matter
.
<EOS>
It
was
his
household
throne
,
and
there
he
sat
with
no
more
idea
of
abdicating
in
favour
of
any
comer
than
King
George
at
St
James
's
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
glad
to
see
his
friends
;
and
had
paid
them
the
unwonted
compliment
of
shaving
on
a
week
-
day
,
and
putting
on
his
Sunday
coat
.
<EOS>
The
united
efforts
of
wife
and
children
had
failed
to
persuade
him
to
make
any
farther
change
in
his
attire
;
to
all
their
arguments
on
this
head
he
had
replied
,
    
"
Them
as
does
n't
like
t
'
see
me
<EOS>
i
'
<EOS>
my
work
-
a
-
day
wescut
and
breeches
may
bide
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
longest
sentence
<EOS>
he
said
that
day
,
but
he
repeated
it
several
times
over
.
<EOS>
He
was
glad
enough
to
see
all
the
young
people
,
but
they
were
not
"
of
his
kidney
,
"
as
he
expressed
it
to
himself
,
and
he
did
not
feel
any
call
upon
himself
to
entertain
them
.
<EOS>
He
left
that
to
his
bustling
wife
,
all
smartness
and
smiles
,
and
to
his
daughters
and
son
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
His
efforts
at
hospitality
consisted
in
sitting
still
,
smoking
his
pipe
;
when
any
one
came
,
he
took
it
out
of
his
mouth
for
an
instant
,
and
nodded
his
head
in
a
cheerful
friendly
way
,
without
a
word
of
speech
;
and
then
returned
to
his
smoking
with
the
greater
relish
for
the
moment
's
intermission
.
<EOS>
He
thought
to
himself
:
    
"
They
're
a
set
o
'
young
chaps
as
thinks
more
on
t
'
lasses
than
on
baccy
;
 
they
'll
find
out
their
mistake
in
time
;
give
'em
time
,
give
'em
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
before
eight
o'clock
,
he
went
as
quietly
as
a
man
of
twelve
stone
can
upstairs
to
bed
,
having
made
a
previous
arrangement
with
his
wife
that
she
should
bring
him
up
about
two
pounds
of
spiced
beef
,
and
a
hot
tumbler
of
stiff
grog
.
<EOS>
But
at
the
beginning
of
the
evening
he
formed
a
good
screen
for
Sylvia
,
who
was
rather
a
favourite
with
the
old
man
,
for
twice
he
spoke
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Feyther
smokes
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Sylvia
.
  
<EOS>
"
Reach
me
t
'
baccy
-
box
,
my
lass
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
that
was
all
the
conversation
that
passed
between
her
and
her
nearest
neighbour
for
the
first
quarter
of
an
hour
after
she
came
into
company
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
for
all
her
screen
,
she
felt
a
pair
of
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
with
a
glow
of
admiration
deepening
their
honest
brightness
.
<EOS>
Somehow
,
look
in
what
direction
<EOS>
she
would
,
she
caught
the
glance
of
those
eyes
before
she
could
see
anything
else
.
<EOS>
So
she
played
with
her
apron
-
strings
,
and
tried
not
to
feel
so
conscious
.
<EOS>
There
were
another
pair
of
eyes
,
 
not
such
beautiful
,
sparkling
eyes
,
 
deep
-
set
,
earnest
,
sad
,
nay
,
even
gloomy
,
watching
her
every
movement
;
but
of
this
she
was
not
aware
.
<EOS>
Philip
had
not
recovered
from
the
rebuff
she
had
given
him
by
refusing
his
offered
hand
,
and
was
standing
still
,
in
angry
silence
,
when
Mrs.
Corney
thrust
a
young
woman
just
arrived
upon
his
attention
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Measter
Hepburn
,
here
's
Nancy
Pratt
wi'out
<EOS>
ev'n
a
soul
to
speak
t
'
her
<EOS>
,
an
'
yo
'
mopin
'

.
<EOS>
She
says
she
knows
yo
'
by
sight
fra
'
having
dealt
at
Foster
's
these
six
year
.
<EOS>
See
if
yo
'
ca
n't
find
summut
t
'
say
t
'
each
other
,
for
I
mun
go
pour
out
tea
.
<EOS>
Dixons
,
an
'
Walkers
,
an
'
Elliotts
,
an
'
Smiths
is
come
,
"
said
she
,
marking
off
the
families
on
her
fingers
,
as
she
looked
round
and
called
over
their
names
;
"
an
'
there
's
only
<EOS>
Will
Latham
an
'
his
two
sisters
,
and
Roger
Harbottle
,
an
'
Taylor
t
'
come
;
an
'
they
'll
turn
up
afore
tea
's
ended
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
she
went
off
to
her
duty
at
the
one
table
,
which
,
placed
alongside
of
the
dresser
,
was
the
only
article
of
furniture
left
in
the
middle
of
the
room
:
all
the
seats
being
arranged
as
close
to
the
four
walls
as
could
be
managed
.
<EOS>
The
candles
of
those
days
gave
but
a
faint
light
compared
to
the
light
of
the
immense
fire
,
which
it
was
a
point
of
hospitality
to
keep
at
the
highest
roaring
,
blazing
pitch
;
the
young
women
occupied
the
seats
,
with
the
exception
of
two
or
three
of
the
elder
ones
,
who
,
in
an
eager
desire
to
show
their
capability
,
insisted
on
helping
Mrs.
Corney
in
her
duties
,
very
much
to
her
annoyance
,
as
there
were
certain
little
contrivances
for
eking
out
cream
,
and
adjusting
the
strength
of
the
cups
of
tea
to
the
worldly
position
of
the
intended
drinkers
,
which
she
did
not
like
every
one
to
see
.
<EOS>
The
young
men
,
 
whom
tea
did
not
embolden
,
and
who
had
as
yet
had
no
chance
of
stronger
liquor
,
 
clustered
in
rustic
shyness
<EOS>
round
the
door
,
not
speaking
even
to
themselves
,
except
now
and
then
,
<EOS>
when
one
,
apparently
the
wag
of
the
party
,
made
some
whispered
remark
,
which
set
them
all
off
laughing
;
but
in
a
minute
they
checked
themselves
,
and
passed
the
back
of
their
hands
across
their
mouths
to
compose
that
unlucky
feature
,
and
then
some
would
try
to
fix
their
eyes
on
the
rafters
of
the
ceiling
,
in
a
manner
which
was
decorous
if
rather
abstracted
from
the
business
in
hand
.
<EOS>
Most
of
these
were
young
farmers
,
with
whom
Philip
had
nothing
in
common
,
and
from
whom
,
in
shy
reserve
,
he
had
withdrawn
himself
when
he
first
came
in
.
<EOS>
But
now
he
wished
himself
among
them
sooner
than
set
to
talk
to
Nancy
Pratt
,
when
he
had
nothing
to
say
.
<EOS>
And
yet
he
might
have
had
a
companion
less
to
his
mind
,
for
she
was
a
decent
young
woman
of
a
sober
age
,
less
inclined
to
giggle
than
many
of
the
younger
ones
.
<EOS>
But
all
the
time
that
he
was
making
commonplace
remarks
to
her
he
was
wondering
if
he
had
offended
Sylvia
,
and
why
she
would
not
shake
hands
with
him
,
and
this
pre
-
occupation
of
his
thoughts
did
not
make
him
an
agreeable
companion
.
<EOS>
Nancy
Pratt
,
who
had
been
engaged
for
some
years
to
a
mate
of
a
whaling
-
ship
,
perceived
something
of
his
state
of
mind
,
and
took
no
offence
at
it
;
on
the
contrary
,
she
tried
to
give
him
pleasure
by
admiring
Sylvia
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
often
heerd
tell
on
her
,
"
said
she
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
niver
thought
she
's
be
so
pretty
,
and
so
staid
and
quiet
-
like
too
.
<EOS>
T
'
most
part
o
'
girls
as
has
looks
like
hers
are
always
gape
-
gazing
to
catch
other
folks
's
eyes
,
and
see
what
is
thought
on
'em
;
but
she
looks
just
like
a
child
,
a
bit
flustered
wi
'
coming
into
company
,
and
gettin
'
into
as
dark
a
corner
and
bidin
'
as
still
as
she
can
.
  
<EOS>
Just
then
Sylvia
lifted
up
her
long
,
dark
lashes
,
and
catching
the
same
glance
which
she
had
so
often
met
before
 
Charley
Kinraid
was
standing
talking
to
Brunton
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
fire
-
place
 
she
started
back
into
the
shadow
as
if
she
had
not
expected
it
,
and
in
so
doing
spilt
her
tea
all
over
her
gown
.
<EOS>
She
could
almost
have
cried
,
she
felt
herself
so
awkward
,
and
as
if
everything
was
going
wrong
with
her
;
she
thought
that
every
one
would
think
she
had
never
been
in
company
before
,
and
did
not
know
how
to
behave
;
and
while
she
was
thus
fluttered
and
crimson
,
she
saw
through
her
tearful
eyes
Kinraid
on
his
knees
before
her
,
wiping
her
gown
with
his
silk
pocket
handkerchief
,
and
heard
him
speaking
through
all
the
buzz
of
commiserating
voices
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
cupboard
handle
is
so
much
<EOS>
i
'
th
'
way
 
<EOS>
I
hurt
my
elbow
against
it
only
this
very
afternoon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
perhaps
it
was
no
clumsiness
of
hers
,
 
as
they
would
all
know
,
now
,
since
he
had
so
skilfully
laid
the
blame
somewhere
else
;
and
after
all
it
turned
out
that
her
accident
had
been
the
means
of
bringing
him
across
to
her
side
,
which
was
much
more
pleasant
than
having
him
opposite
,
staring
at
her
;
for
now
he
began
to
talk
to
her
,
and
this
was
very
pleasant
,
although
she
was
rather
embarrassed
at
their
_
tete
-
a
-
tete
_
at
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
know
you
again
when
I
first
saw
you
,
"
said
he
,
in
a
tone
which
implied
a
good
deal
more
than
was
uttered
in
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
knowed
yo
'
at
once
,
"
she
replied
,
softly
,
and
then
she
blushed
and
played
with
her
apron
-
string
,
and
wondered
if
she
ought
to
have
confessed
to
the
clearness
of
her
recollection
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
grown
up
into
 
well
<EOS>
,
perhaps
it
's
not
manners
to
say
what
you
're
grown
into
 
<EOS>
anyhow
,
I
sha
n't
forget
yo
'
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
More
playing
with
her
apron
-
string
,
and
head
hung
still
lower
down
,
though
the
corners
of
her
mouth
would
go
up
in
a
shy
smile
of
pleasure
.
<EOS>
Philip
watched
it
all
as
greedily
as
if
it
gave
him
delight
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yo'r
father
,
he
'll
be
well
and
hearty
,
I
hope
?
"
asked
Charley
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
replied
Sylvia
,
and
then
she
wished
she
could
originate
some
remark
;
he
would
think
her
so
stupid
if
she
just
kept
on
saying
such
little
short
bits
of
speeches
,
and
if
he
thought
her
stupid
he
might
perhaps
go
away
again
to
his
former
place
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
was
quite
far
enough
gone
in
love
of
her
beauty
,
and
pretty
modest
ways
,
not
to
care
much
whether
she
talked
or
no
,
so
long
as
she
showed
herself
so
pleasingly
conscious
of
his
close
neighbourhood
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
come
and
see
the
old
gentleman
;
and
your
mother
,
too
,
"
he
added
more
slowly
,
for
he
remembered
that
his
visits
last
year
had
not
been
quite
so
much
welcomed
by
Bell
Robson
as
by
her
husband
;
perhaps
it
was
because
of
the
amount
of
drink
which
he
and
Daniel
managed
to
get
through
of
an
evening
.
<EOS>
He
resolved
this
year
to
be
more
careful
to
please
the
mother
of
Sylvia
.
  
<EOS>
When
tea
was
ended
there
was
a
great
bustle
and
shifting
of
places
,
while
Mrs.
Corney
and
her
daughters
carried
out
trays
full
of
used
cups
,
and
great
platters
of
uneaten
bread
and
butter
into
the
back
-
kitchen
,
to
be
washed
up
after
the
guests
were
gone
.
<EOS>
Just
because
she
was
so
conscious
that
she
did
not
want
to
move
,
and
break
up
the
little
conversation
between
herself
and
Kinraid
,
Sylvia
forced
herself
to
be
as
active
in
the
service
going
on
as
became
a
friend
of
the
house
;
and
she
was
too
much
her
mother
's
own
daughter
to
feel
comfortable
at
leaving
all
the
things
in
the
disorder
which
to
the
Corney
girls
was
second
nature
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
milk
mun
go
back
to
t
'
dairy
,
I
reckon
,
"
said
she
,
loading
herself
with
milk
and
cream
.
  
<EOS>
"
Niver
fash
thysel
'
about
it
,
"
said
Nelly
Corney
,
"
Christmas
comes
but
onest
a
year
,
if
it
does
go
sour
;
and
mother
said
she
'd
have
a
game
at
forfeits
first
thing
after
tea
to
loosen
folks
's
tongues
,
and
mix
up
t
'
lads
and
lasses
,
so
come
along
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
Sylvia
steered
her
careful
way
to
the
cold
chill
of
the
dairy
,
and
would
not
be
satisfied
till
she
had
carried
away
all
the
unused
provision
into
some
fresher
air
than
that
heated
by
the
fires
and
ovens
used
for
the
long
day
's
cooking
of
pies
and
cakes
and
much
roast
meat
.
  
<EOS>
When
they
came
back
a
round
of
red
-
faced
"
lads
,
"
as
young
men
up
to
five
-
and
-
thirty
are
called
in
Lancashire
and
Yorkshire
if
they
are
not
married
before
,
and
lasses
,
whose
age
was
not
to
be
defined
,
were
playing
at
some
country
game
,
in
which
the
women
were
apparently
more
interested
than
the
men
,
who
looked
shamefaced
,
and
afraid
of
each
other
's
ridicule
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Corney
,
however
,
knew
how
to
remedy
this
,
and
at
a
sign
from
her
a
great
jug
of
beer
was
brought
in
.
<EOS>
This
jug
was
the
pride
of
her
heart
,
and
was
in
the
shape
of
a
fat
man
in
white
knee
-
breeches
,
and
a
three
-
cornered
hat
;
with
one
arm
he
supported
the
pipe
in
his
broad
,
smiling
mouth
,
and
the
other
was
placed
akimbo
and
formed
the
handle
.
<EOS>
There
was
also
a
great
china
punch
-
bowl
filled
with
grog
made
after
an
old
ship
-
receipt
current
in
these
parts
,
but
not
too
strong
,
because
if
their
visitors
had
too
much
to
drink
at
that
early
part
of
the
evening
"
it
would
spoil
t
'
fun
,
"
as
Nelly
Corney
had
observed
.
<EOS>
Her
father
,
however
,
after
the
notions
of
hospitality
prevalent
at
that
time
in
higher
circles
,
had
stipulated
that
each
man
should
have
"
enough
"
before
he
left
the
house
;
enough
meaning
in
Monkshaven
parlance
the
liberty
of
getting
drunk
,
if
they
thought
fit
to
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
Before
long
one
of
the
lads
was
seized
with
a
fit
of
admiration
for
Toby
 
<EOS>
the
name
of
the
old
gentleman
who
contained
liquor
 
and
went
up
to
the
tray
for
a
closer
inspection
.
<EOS>
He
was
speedily
followed
by
other
amateurs
of
curious
earthenware
;
and
by
-
and
-
by
Mr.
Brunton
(
who
had
been
charged
by
his
mother
-
in
-
law
with
the
due
supplying
of
liquor
 
by
his
father
-
in
-
law
that
every
man
should
have
his
fill
,
and
by
his
wife
and
her
sisters
that
no
one
should
have
too
much
,
at
any
rate
at
the
beginning
of
the
evening
,
)
thought
fit
to
carry
out
Toby
to
be
replenished
;
and
a
faster
spirit
of
enjoyment
and
mirth
began
to
reign
in
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
Kinraid
was
too
well
seasoned
to
care
what
amount
of
liquor
he
drank
;
Philip
had
what
was
called
a
weak
head
,
and
disliked
muddling
himself
with
drink
because
of
the
immediate
consequence
of
intense
feelings
of
irritability
,
and
the
more
distant
one
of
a
racking
headache
next
day
;
so
both
these
two
preserved
very
much
the
same
demeanour
they
had
held
at
the
beginning
of
the
evening
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
was
by
all
acknowledged
and
treated
as
the
belle
.
<EOS>
When
they
played
at
blind
-
man's
-
buff
go
where
she
would
,
she
was
always
caught
;
she
was
called
out
repeatedly
to
do
what
was
required
in
any
game
,
as
if
all
had
a
pleasure
in
seeing
her
light
figure
and
deft
ways
.
<EOS>
She
was
sufficiently
pleased
with
this
to
have
got
over
her
shyness
with
all
except
Charley
.
<EOS>
When
others
paid
her
their
rustic
compliments
she
tossed
her
head
,
and
made
her
little
saucy
repartees
;
but
when
he
said
something
low
and
flattering
,
it
was
too
honey
-
sweet
to
her
heart
to
be
thrown
off
thus
.
<EOS>
And
,
somehow
,
the
more
she
yielded
to
this
fascination
the
more
she
avoided
Philip
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
speak
flatteringly
 
<EOS>
he
did
not
pay
compliments
 
<EOS>
he
watched
her
with
discontented
,
longing
eyes
,
and
grew
more
inclined
every
moment
,
as
he
remembered
his
anticipation
of
a
happy
evening
,
to
cry
out
in
his
heart
_
vanitas
vanitatum
_
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
came
crying
the
forfeits
.
<EOS>
Molly
Brunton
knelt
down
,
her
face
buried
in
her
mother
's
lap
;
the
latter
took
out
the
forfeits
one
by
one
,
and
as
she
held
them
up
,
said
the
accustomed
formula
,
    
"
A
fine
thing
and
a
very
fine
thing
<EOS>
,
what
must
he
(
or
she
)
do
who
owns
this
thing
.
"
  
<EOS>
One
or
two
had
been
told
to
kneel
to
the
prettiest
,
bow
to
the
wittiest
,
and
kiss
those
they
loved
best
;
others
had
had
to
bite
an
inch
off
the
poker
,
or
such
plays
upon
words
.
<EOS>
And
now
came
Sylvia
's
pretty
new
ribbon
that
Philip
had
given
her
<EOS>
(
he
almost
longed
to
snatch
it
out
of
Mrs.
Corney
's
hands
and
burn
it
before
all
their
faces
,
<EOS>
so
annoyed
was
he
with
the
whole
affair
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
A
fine
thing
and
a
very
fine
thing
 
a
most
particular
fine
thing
 
choose
how
she
came
by
it
.
<EOS>
What
must
she
do
as
owns
this
thing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
must
blow
out
t
'
candle
and
kiss
t
'
candlestick
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
one
instant
Kinraid
had
hold
of
the
only
candle
within
reach
,
all
the
others
had
been
put
up
high
on
inaccessible
shelves
and
other
places
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
went
up
and
blew
out
the
candle
,
and
before
the
sudden
partial
darkness
was
over
he
had
taken
the
candle
into
his
fingers
,
and
,
according
to
the
traditional
meaning
of
the
words
,
was
in
the
place
of
the
candlestick
,
and
as
such
was
to
be
kissed
.
<EOS>
Every
one
laughed
at
innocent
Sylvia
's
face
as
the
meaning
of
her
penance
came
into
it
,
every
one
but
Philip
,
who
almost
choked
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
candlestick
,
"
said
Kinraid
,
with
less
of
triumph
in
his
voice
than
he
would
have
had
with
any
other
girl
in
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yo
'
mun
kiss
t
'
candlestick
,
"
cried
the
Corneys
,
"
or
yo'll
niver
get
yo'r
ribbon
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
she
sets
a
deal
o
'
store
by
that
ribbon
,
"
said
Molly
Brunton
,
maliciously
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
none
kiss
t
'
candlestick
,
nor
him
either
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
in
a
low
voice
of
determination
,
turning
away
,
full
of
confusion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yo'll
not
get
yo'r
ribbon
<EOS>
if
yo
'
dunnot
,
"
cried
one
and
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
for
t
'
ribbon
,
"
said
she
,
flashing
up
with
a
look
at
her
tormentors
,
now
her
back
was
turned
to
Kinraid
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
An
'
I
wunnot
play
any
more
at
such
like
games
,
"
she
added
,
with
fresh
indignation
rising
in
her
heart
as
she
took
her
old
place
in
the
corner
of
the
room
a
little
away
from
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
's
spirits
rose
,
and
he
yearned
to
go
to
her
and
tell
her
how
he
approved
of
her
conduct
.
<EOS>
Alas
,
Philip
!
<EOS>
Sylvia
,
though
as
modest
a
girl
as
ever
lived
,
was
no
prude
,
and
had
been
brought
up
in
simple
,
straightforward
country
ways
;
and
with
any
other
young
man
,
excepting
,
perhaps
,
Philip
's
self
<EOS>
,
she
would
have
thought
no
more
of
making
a
rapid
pretence
of
kissing
the
hand
or
cheek
of
the
temporary
"
candlestick
"
,
than
our
ancestresses
did
in
a
much
higher
rank
on
similar
occasions
.
<EOS>
Kinraid
,
though
mortified
by
his
public
rejection
,
was
more
conscious
of
this
than
the
inexperienced
Philip
;
he
resolved
not
to
be
baulked
,
and
watched
his
opportunity
.
<EOS>
For
the
time
he
went
on
playing
as
if
Sylvia
's
conduct
had
not
affected
him
in
the
least
,
and
as
if
he
was
hardly
aware
of
her
defection
from
the
game
.
<EOS>
As
she
saw
others
submitting
,
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
,
to
similar
penances
,
she
began
to
be
angry
with
herself
for
having
thought
twice
about
it
,
and
almost
to
dislike
herself
for
the
strange
consciousness
which
had
made
it
at
the
time
seem
impossible
to
do
what
she
was
told
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
kept
filling
with
tears
as
her
isolated
position
in
the
gay
party
,
the
thought
of
what
a
fool
she
had
made
of
herself
,
kept
recurring
to
her
mind
;
but
no
one
saw
her
,
she
thought
,
thus
crying
;
and
,
ashamed
to
be
discovered
when
the
party
should
pause
in
their
game
,
she
stole
round
behind
them
into
the
great
chamber
in
which
she
had
helped
to
lay
out
the
supper
,
with
the
intention
of
bathing
her
eyes
,
and
taking
a
drink
of
water
.
<EOS>
One
instant
Charley
Kinraid
was
missing
from
the
circle
of
which
he
was
the
life
and
soul
;
and
then
back
he
came
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
on
his
face
,
intelligible
enough
to
those
who
had
seen
his
game
;
but
unnoticed
by
Philip
,
who
,
amidst
the
perpetual
noise
and
movements
around
him
,
had
not
perceived
Sylvia
's
leaving
the
room
,
until
she
came
back
at
the
end
of
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
looking
lovelier
than
ever
,
her
complexion
brilliant
,
her
eyes
drooping
,
her
hair
neatly
and
freshly
arranged
,
tied
with
a
brown
ribbon
instead
of
that
she
was
supposed
to
have
forfeited
.
<EOS>
She
looked
as
if
she
did
not
wish
her
return
to
be
noticed
,
stealing
softly
behind
the
romping
lads
and
lasses
with
noiseless
motions
,
and
altogether
such
a
contrast
to
them
in
her
cool
freshness
and
modest
neatness
,
that
both
Kinraid
and
Philip
found
it
difficult
to
keep
their
eyes
off
her
.
<EOS>
But
the
former
had
a
secret
triumph
in
his
heart
which
enabled
him
to
go
on
with
his
merry
-
making
as
if
it
absorbed
him
;
while
Philip
dropped
out
of
the
crowd
and
came
up
to
where
she
was
standing
silently
by
Mrs.
Corney
,
who
,
arms
akimbo
,
was
laughing
at
the
frolic
and
fun
around
her
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
started
a
little
when
Philip
spoke
,
and
kept
her
soft
eyes
averted
from
him
after
the
first
glance
;
she
answered
him
shortly
,
but
with
unaccustomed
gentleness
.
<EOS>
He
had
only
asked
her
when
she
would
like
him
to
take
her
home
;
and
she
,
a
little
surprised
at
the
idea
of
going
home
when
to
her
the
evening
seemed
only
beginning
,
had
answered
    
"
Go
home
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
!
<EOS>
It
's
New
Year
's
eve
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
<EOS>
but
yo'r
mother
'll
lie
awake
till
<EOS>
yo
'
come
home
,
Sylvie
!
"
  
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Corney
,
having
heard
his
question
,
broke
in
with
all
sorts
of
upbraidings
.
<EOS>
"
Go
home
!
<EOS>
Not
see
t
'
New
Year
in
!
<EOS>
Why
,
what
should
take
'em
home
these
six
hours
?
<EOS>
Was
n't
there
a
moon
as
clear
as
day
?
<EOS>
and
did
such
a
time
as
this
come
often
?
<EOS>
And
were
they
to
break
up
the
party
before
the
New
Year
came
in
?
<EOS>
And
was
there
not
supper
,
with
a
spiced
round
of
beef
that
had
been
in
pickle
pretty
nigh
sin
'
Martinmas
,
and
hams
,
and
mince
-
pies
,
and
what
not
?
<EOS>
And
if
they
thought
any
evil
of
her
master
's
going
to
bed
,
or
that
by
that
early
retirement
he
meant
to
imply
that
he
did
not
bid
his
friends
welcome
,
why
he
would
not
stay
up
beyond
eight
o'clock
for
King
George
upon
his
throne
,
as
he
'd
tell
them
soon
enough
,
if
they
'd
only
step
upstairs
and
ask
him
.
<EOS>
Well
;
she
knowed
what
it
was
to
want
a
daughter
when
she
was
ailing
,
so
she
'd
say
nought
more
,
but
hasten
supper
.
  
<EOS>
And
this
idea
now
took
possession
of
Mrs.
Corney
's
mind
,
for
she
would
not
willingly
allow
one
of
her
guests
to
leave
before
they
had
done
justice
to
her
preparations
;
and
,
cutting
her
speech
short
,
she
hastily
left
Sylvia
and
Philip
together
.
  
<EOS>
His
heart
beat
fast
;
his
feeling
towards
her
had
never
been
so
strong
or
so
distinct
as
since
her
refusal
to
kiss
the
"
candlestick
.
"
<EOS>
He
was
on
the
point
of
speaking
,
of
saying
something
explicitly
tender
,
when
the
wooden
trencher
which
the
party
were
using
at
their
play
,
came
bowling
between
him
and
Sylvia
,
and
spun
out
its
little
period
right
betwixt
them
.
<EOS>
Every
one
was
moving
from
chair
to
chair
,
and
when
the
bustle
was
over
Sylvia
was
seated
at
some
distance
from
him
,
and
he
left
standing
outside
the
circle
,
as
if
he
were
not
playing
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
Sylvia
had
unconsciously
taken
his
place
as
actor
in
the
game
while
he
remained
spectator
,
and
,
as
it
turned
out
,
an
auditor
of
a
conversation
not
intended
for
his
ears
.
<EOS>
He
was
wedged
against
the
wall
,
close
to
the
great
eight
-
day
clock
,
with
its
round
moon
-
like
smiling
face
forming
a
ludicrous
contrast
to
his
long
,
sallow
,
grave
countenance
,
which
was
pretty
much
at
the
same
level
above
the
sanded
floor
.
<EOS>
Before
him
sat
Molly
Brunton
and
one
of
her
sisters
,
their
heads
close
together
in
too
deep
talk
to
attend
to
the
progress
of
the
game
.
<EOS>
Philip
's
attention
was
caught
by
the
words
    
<EOS>
"
I
'll
lay
any
wager
he
kissed
her
when
he
ran
off
into
t
'
parlour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
so
coy
<EOS>
she
'd
niver
let
him
,
"
replied
Bessy
Corney
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
could
n't
help
hersel
'
;
and
for
all
she
looks
so
demure
and
prim
now
'
<EOS>
(
and
then
both
heads
were
turned
in
the
direction
of
Sylvia
)
,
"
I
'm
as
sure
as
I
'm
born
that
Charley
is
not
t
'
chap
to
lose
his
forfeit
;
and
yet
yo
'
see
he
says
nought
more
about
it
,
and
she
's
left
off
being
"
feared
of
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
Sylvia
's
look
,
ay
,
and
in
Charley
Kinraid
's
,
too
,
that
shot
conviction
into
Philip
's
mind
.
<EOS>
He
watched
them
incessantly
during
the
interval
before
supper
;
they
were
intimate
,
and
yet
shy
with
each
other
,
in
a
manner
that
enraged
while
it
bewildered
Philip
.
<EOS>
What
was
Charley
saying
to
her
in
that
whispered
voice
,
as
they
passed
each
other
?
<EOS>
Why
did
they
linger
near
each
other
?
<EOS>
Why
did
Sylvia
look
so
dreamily
happy
,
so
startled
at
every
call
of
the
game
,
as
if
recalled
from
some
pleasant
idea
?
<EOS>
Why
did
Kinraid
's
eyes
always
seek
her
while
hers
were
averted
,
or
downcast
,
and
her
cheeks
all
aflame
?
<EOS>
Philip
's
dark
brow
grew
darker
as
he
gazed
.
<EOS>
He
,
too
,
started
when
Mrs.
Corney
,
close
at
his
elbow
,
bade
him
go
in
to
supper
along
with
some
of
the
elder
ones
,
who
were
not
playing
;
for
the
parlour
was
not
large
enough
to
hold
all
at
once
,
even
with
the
squeezing
and
cramming
,
and
sitting
together
on
chairs
,
which
was
not
at
all
out
of
etiquette
at
Monkshaven
.
<EOS>
Philip
was
too
reserved
to
express
his
disappointment
and
annoyance
at
being
thus
arrested
in
his
painful
watch
over
Sylvia
;
but
he
had
no
appetite
for
the
good
things
set
before
him
,
and
found
it
hard
work
to
smile
a
sickly
smile
when
called
upon
by
Josiah
Pratt
for
applause
at
some
country
joke
.
<EOS>
When
supper
was
ended
,
there
was
some
little
discussion
between
Mrs.
Corney
and
her
son
-
in
-
law
as
to
whether
the
different
individuals
of
the
company
should
be
called
upon
for
songs
or
stories
,
as
was
the
wo
nt
at
such
convivial
meetings
.
<EOS>
Brunton
had
been
helping
his
mother
-
in
-
law
in
urging
people
to
eat
,
heaping
their
plates
over
their
shoulders
with
unexpected
good
things
,
filling
the
glasses
at
the
upper
end
of
the
table
,
and
the
mugs
which
supplied
the
deficiency
of
glasses
at
the
lower
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
every
one
being
satisfied
,
not
to
say
stuffed
to
repletion
,
the
two
who
had
been
attending
to
their
wants
stood
still
,
hot
and
exhausted
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
're
a'most
stawed
,
"
said
Mrs.
Corney
,
with
a
pleased
smile
.
<EOS>
"
It
'll
be
manners
t
'
ask
some
one
as
knows
how
to
sing
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
manners
for
full
men
,
but
not
for
fasting
,
"
replied
Brunton
.
<EOS>
"
Folks
in
t
'
next
room
will
be
wanting
their
victual
,
and
singing
is
allays
out
o
'
tune
to
empty
bellies
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
there
's
them
here
as
'll
take
it
ill
if
they
're
not
asked
.
<EOS>
I
heerd
Josiah
Pratt
a
-
clearing
his
throat
not
a
minute
ago
,
an
'
he
thinks
as
much
on
his
singin
'
as
a
cock
does
on
his
crowin
'
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
one
sings
I
'm
afeard
all
on
'em
will
like
to
hear
their
own
pipes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
their
dilemma
was
solved
by
Bessy
Corney
,
who
opened
the
door
to
see
if
the
hungry
ones
outside
might
not
come
in
for
their
share
of
the
entertainment
;
and
in
they
rushed
,
bright
and
riotous
,
scarcely
giving
the
first
party
time
to
rise
from
their
seats
ere
<EOS>
they
took
their
places
.
<EOS>
One
or
two
young
men
,
released
from
all
their
previous
shyness
,
helped
Mrs.
Corney
and
her
daughters
to
carry
off
such
dishes
as
were
actually
empty
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
time
for
changing
or
washing
of
plates
;
but
then
,
as
Mrs.
Corney
laughingly
observed
,
    
"
We
're
a
'
on
us
friends
,
and
some
on
us
mayhap
sweethearts
;
so
no
need
to
be
particular
about
plates
.
<EOS>
Them
as
gets
clean
ones
is
lucky
;
and
them
as
does
n't
,
and
can
not
put
up
wi
'
plates
that
has
been
used
,
mun
go
without
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
be
Philip
's
luck
this
night
to
be
pent
up
in
places
;
for
again
the
space
between
the
benches
and
the
wall
was
filled
up
by
the
in
-
rush
before
he
had
time
to
make
his
way
out
;
and
all
he
could
do
was
to
sit
quiet
where
he
was
.
<EOS>
But
between
the
busy
heads
and
over
-
reaching
arms
he
could
see
Charley
and
Sylvia
,
sitting
close
together
,
talking
and
listening
more
than
eating
.
<EOS>
She
was
in
a
new
strange
state
of
happiness
not
to
be
reasoned
about
,
or
accounted
for
,
but
in
a
state
of
more
exquisite
feeling
than
she
had
ever
experienced
before
;
when
,
suddenly
lifting
her
eyes
,
she
caught
Philip
's
face
of
extreme
displeasure
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
"
said
she
,
"
I
must
go
.
<EOS>
There
's
Philip
looking
at
me
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Philip
!
"
said
Kinraid
,
with
a
sudden
frown
upon
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
cousin
,
"
she
replied
,
instinctively
comprehending
what
had
flashed
into
his
mind
,
and
anxious
to
disclaim
the
suspicion
of
having
a
lover
.
"
<EOS>
Mother
told
him
to
see
me
home
,
and
he
's
noan
one
for
staying
up
late
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
need
n't
go
.
<EOS>
I
'll
see
yo
'
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
's
but
ailing
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
a
little
conscience
-
smitten
at
having
so
entirely
forgotten
everything
in
the
delight
of
the
present
,
"
and
I
said
I
would
n't
be
late
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
do
you
allays
keep
to
your
word
?
"
<EOS>
asked
he
,
with
a
tender
meaning
in
his
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Allays
<EOS>
;
leastways
I
think
so
,
"
replied
she
,
blushing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
if
I
ask
you
not
to
forget
me
,
and
you
give
me
your
word
,
I
may
be
sure
you
'll
keep
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
n't
I
as
forgot
you
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
so
softly
as
not
to
be
heard
by
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
tried
to
make
her
repeat
what
she
had
said
,
but
she
would
not
,
and
he
could
only
conjecture
that
it
was
something
more
tell
-
tale
than
she
liked
to
say
again
,
and
that
alone
was
very
charming
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
walk
home
with
you
,
"
said
he
,
as
Sylvia
at
last
rose
to
depart
,
warned
by
a
further
glimpse
of
Philip
's
angry
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
said
she
,
hastily
,
"
I
ca
n't
do
with
yo
'
'
;
for
somehow
she
felt
the
need
of
pacifying
Philip
,
and
knew
in
her
heart
that
a
third
person
joining
their
_
tete
-
a
-
tete
_
walk
would
only
increase
his
displeasure
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
said
Charley
,
sharply
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
,
only
please
do
n't
!
"
  
<EOS>
By
this
time
her
cloak
and
hood
were
on
,
and
she
was
slowly
making
her
way
down
her
side
of
the
room
followed
by
Charley
,
and
often
interrupted
by
indignant
remonstrances
against
her
departure
,
and
the
early
breaking
-
up
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
Philip
stood
,
hat
in
hand
,
in
the
doorway
between
the
kitchen
and
parlour
,
watching
her
so
intently
that
he
forgot
to
be
civil
,
and
drew
many
a
jest
and
gibe
upon
him
for
his
absorption
in
his
pretty
cousin
.
  
<EOS>
When
Sylvia
reached
him
,
he
said
,
    
<EOS>
"
Yo're
ready
at
last
,
are
yo
'
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
she
replied
,
in
her
little
beseeching
tone
.
"
<EOS>
Yo've
not
been
wanting
to
go
long
,
han
yo
'
?
<EOS>
I
ha
'
but
just
eaten
my
supper
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yo've
been
so
full
of
talk
,
that
's
been
the
reason
your
supper
lasted
so
long
.
<EOS>
That
fellow
's
none
going
wi
'
us
?
"
said
he
sharply
,
as
he
saw
Kinraid
rummaging
for
his
cap
in
a
heap
of
men
's
clothes
,
thrown
into
the
back
-
kitchen
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
in
affright
at
Philip
's
fierce
look
and
passionate
tone
.
<EOS>
"
I
telled
him
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
at
that
moment
the
heavy
outer
door
was
opened
by
Daniel
Robson
himself
 
bright
,
broad
,
and
rosy
,
a
jolly
impersonation
of
Winter
.
<EOS>
His

's

was
covered
with
snow
-
flakes
,
and
through
the
black
frame
of
the
doorway
might
be
seen
a
white
waste
world
of
sweeping
fell
and
field
,
with
the
dark
air
filled
with
the
pure
down
-
fall
.
<EOS>
Robson
stamped
his
snow
-
laden
feet
and
shook
himself
well
,
still
standing
on
the
mat
,
and
letting
a
cold
frosty
current
of
fresh
air
into
the
great
warm
kitchen
.

He
laughed
at
them
all
before
he
spoke

<EOS>
"
  
Sylvia
was
all
this
while
standing
by
her
father
quite
ready
for
departure
,
and
not
a
little
relieved
by
his
appearance
as
her
convoy
home
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
ready
to
see
Haytersbank
to
-
night
,
master
!
"
<EOS>
said
Kinraid
,
with
easy
freedom
 
<EOS>
a
freedom
which
Philip
envied
,
but
could
not
have
imitated
,
although
he
was
deeply
disappointed
at
the
loss
of
his
walk
with
Sylvia
,
when
he
had
intended
to
exercise
the
power
his
aunt
had
delegated
to
him
of
remonstrance
if
her
behaviour
had
been
light
or
thoughtless
,
and
of
warning
if
he
saw
cause
to
disapprove
of
any
of
her
associates
.
  
<EOS>
After
the
Robsons
had
left
,
a
blank
fell
upon
both
Charley
and
Philip
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
,
however
,
the
former
,
accustomed
to
prompt
decision
,
resolved
that
she
and
no
other
should
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
Accustomed
to
popularity
among
women
,
and
well
versed
in
the
incipient
signs
of
their
liking
for
him
,
he
anticipated
no
difficulty
in
winning
her
.
<EOS>
Satisfied
with
the
past
,
and
pleasantly
hopeful
about
the
future
,
he
found
it
easy
to
turn
his
attention
to
the
next
prettiest
girl
in
the
room
,
and
to
make
the
whole
gathering
bright
with
his
ready
good
temper
and
buoyant
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Corney
had
felt
it
her
duty
to
press
Philip
to
stay
,
now
that
,
as
she
said
,
he
had
no
one
but
himself
to
see
home
,
and
the
new
year
so
near
coming
in
.
<EOS>
To
any
one
else
in
the
room
she
would
have
added
the
clinching
argument
,
"
A
shall
take
it
very
unkind
if
yo
'
go
now
'
;
but
somehow
she
could
not
say
this
,
for
in
truth
Philip
's
look
showed
that
he
would
be
but
a
wet
blanket
on
the
merriment
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
So
,
with
as
much
civility
as
could
be
mustered
up
between
them
,
he
took
leave
.
<EOS>
Shutting
the
door
behind
him
,
he
went
out
into
the
dreary
night
,
and
began
his
lonesome
walk
back
to
Monkshaven
.
<EOS>
The
cold
sleet
almost
blinded
him
as
the
sea
-
wind
drove
it
straight
in
his
face
;
it
cut
against
him
as
it
was
blown
with
drifting
force
.
<EOS>
The
roar
of
the
wintry
sea
came
borne
on
the
breeze
;
there
was
more
light
from
the
whitened
ground
than
from
the
dark
laden
sky
above
.
<EOS>
The
field
-
paths
would
have
been
a
matter
of
perplexity
,
had
it
not
been
for
the
well
-
known
gaps
in
the
dyke
-
side
,
which
showed
the
whitened
land
beyond
,
between
the
two
dark
stone
walls
.
<EOS>
Yet
he
went
clear
and
straight
along
his
way
,
having
unconsciously
left
all
guidance
to
the
animal
instinct
which
co
-
exists
with
the
human
soul
,
and
sometimes
takes
strange
charge
of
the
human
body
,
when
all
the
nobler
powers
of
the
individual
are
absorbed
in
acute
suffering
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
was
in
the
lane
,
toiling
up
the
hill
,
from
which
,
by
day
,
Monkshaven
might
be
seen
.
<EOS>
Now
all
features
of
the
landscape
before
him
were
lost
in
the
darkness
of
night
,
against
which
the
white
flakes
came
closer
and
nearer
,
thicker
and
faster
.
<EOS>
On
a
sudden
,
the
bells
of
Monkshaven
church
rang
out
a
welcome
to
the
new
year
,
1796
.
<EOS>
From
the
direction
of
the
wind
,
it
seemed
as
if
the
sound
was
flung
with
strength
and
power
right
into
Philip
's
face
.
<EOS>
He
walked
down
the
hill
to
its
merry
sound
 
its
merry
sound
,
his
heavy
heart
.
<EOS>
As
he
entered
the
long
High
Street
of
Monkshaven
he
could
see
the
watching
lights
put
out
in
parlour
,
chamber
,
or
kitchen
.
<EOS>
The
new
year
had
come
,
and
expectation
was
ended
.
<EOS>
Reality
had
begun
.
  
<EOS>
He
turned
to
the
right
,
into
the
court
where
he
lodged
with
Alice
Rose
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
light
still
burning
there
,
and
cheerful
voices
were
heard
.
<EOS>
He
opened
the
door
;
Alice
,
her
daughter
,
and
Coulson
stood
as
if
awaiting
him
.
<EOS>
Hester
's
wet
cloak
hung
on
a
chair
before
the
fire
;
she
had
her
hood
on
,
<EOS>
for
she
and
Coulson
had
been
to
the
watch
-
night
.
  
<EOS>
The
solemn
excitement
of
the
services
had
left
its
traces
upon
her
countenance
and
in
her
mind
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
spiritual
light
in
her
usually
shadowed
eyes
,
and
a
slight
flush
on
her
pale
cheek
.
<EOS>
Merely
personal
and
self
-
conscious
feelings
were
merged
in
a
loving
good
-
will
to
all
her
fellow
-
creatures
.
<EOS>
Under
the
influence
of
this
large
charity
,
she
forgot
her
habitual
reserve
,
and
came
forward
as
Philip
entered
to
meet
him
with
her
new
year
's
wishes
 
<EOS>
wishes
that
she
had
previously
interchanged
with
the
other
two
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
happy
new
year
to
you
,
Philip
,
and
may
God
have
you
in
his
keeping
all
the
days
thereof
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
took
her
hand
,
and
shook
it
warmly
in
reply
.
<EOS>
The
flush
on
her
cheek
deepened
as
she
withdrew
it
.
<EOS>
Alice
Rose
said
something
curtly
about
the
lateness
of
the
hour
and
her
being
much
tired
;
and
then
she
and
her
daughter
went
upstairs
to
the
front
chamber
,
and
Philip
and
Coulson
to
that
which
they
shared
at
the
back
of
the
house
.
    
<EOS>
PERPLEXITIES
  
<EOS>
Coulson
and
Philip
were
friendly
,
but
not
intimate
.
<EOS>
They
never
had
had
a
dispute
,
they
never
were
confidential
with
each
other
;
in
truth
,
they
were
both
reserved
and
silent
men
,
and
,
probably
,
respected
each
other
the
more
for
being
so
self
-
contained
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
private
feeling
in
Coulson
's
heart
which
would
have
made
a
less
amiable
fellow
dislike
Philip
.
<EOS>
But
of
this
the
latter
was
unconscious
:
they
were
not
apt
to
exchange
many
words
in
the
room
which
they
occupied
jointly
.
  
<EOS>
Coulson
asked
Philip
if
he
had
enjoyed
himself
at
the
Corneys
'
,
and
Philip
replied
,
    
"
Not
much
;
such
parties
are
noane
to
my
liking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
yet
thou
broke
off
from
t
'
watch
-
night
to
go
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
No
answer
;
so
Coulson
went
on
,
with
a
sense
of
the
duty
laid
upon
him
,
to
improve
the
occasion
 
the
first
that
had
presented
itself
since
the
good
old
Methodist
minister
had
given
his
congregation
the
solemn
warning
to
watch
over
the
opportunities
of
various
kinds
which
the
coming
year
would
present
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jonas
Barclay
told
us
as
the
pleasures
o
'
<EOS>
this
world
were
like
apples
o
'
Sodom
,
pleasant
to
look
at
,
but
ashes
to
taste
.
"
  
<EOS>
Coulson
wisely
left
Philip
to
make
the
application
for
himself
.
<EOS>
If
he
did
he
made
no
sign
,
but
threw
himself
on
his
bed
with
a
heavy
sigh
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
yo
'
not
going
to
undress
?
"
said
Coulson
,
as
he
covered
him
up
in
bed
.
  
<EOS>
There
had
been
a
long
pause
of
silence
.
<EOS>
Philip
did
not
answer
him
,
and
he
thought
he
had
fallen
asleep
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
roused
from
his
first
slumber
by
Hepburn
's
soft
movements
about
the
room
.
<EOS>
Philip
had
thought
better
of
it
,
and
,
with
some
penitence
in
his
heart
for
his
gruffness
to
the
unoffending
Coulson
,
was
trying
not
to
make
any
noise
while
he
undressed
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
could
not
sleep
.
<EOS>
He
kept
seeing
the
Corneys
'
kitchen
and
the
scenes
that
had
taken
place
in
it
,
passing
like
a
pageant
before
his
closed
eyes
.
<EOS>
Then
he
opened
them
in
angry
weariness
at
the
recurring
vision
,
and
tried
to
make
out
the
outlines
of
the
room
and
the
furniture
in
the
darkness
.
<EOS>
The
white
ceiling
sloped
into
the
whitewashed
walls
,
and
against
them
he
could
see
the
four
rush
-
bottomed
chairs
,
the
looking
-
glass
hung
on
one
side
,
the
old
carved
oak
-
chest
(
his
own
property
,
with
the
initials
of
forgotten
ancestors
cut
upon
it
)
,
which
held
his
clothes
;
the
boxes
that
belonged
to
Coulson
,
sleeping
soundly
in
the
bed
in
the
opposite
corner
of
the
room
;
the
casement
window
in
the
roof
,
through
which
the
snowy
ground
on
the
steep
hill
-
side
could
be
plainly
seen
;
and
when
he
got
so
far
as
this
in
the
catalogue
of
the
room
,
he
fell
into
a
troubled
feverish
sleep
,
which
lasted
two
or
three
hours
;
and
then
he
awoke
with
a
start
,
and
a
consciousness
of
uneasiness
,
though
what
about
he
could
not
remember
at
first
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
recollected
all
that
had
happened
the
night
before
,
it
impressed
him
much
more
favourably
than
it
had
done
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
If
not
joy
,
hope
had
come
in
the
morning
;
and
,
at
any
rate
,
he
could
be
up
and
be
doing
,
for
the
late
wintry
light
was
stealing
down
the
hill
-
side
,
and
he
knew
that
,
although
Coulson
lay
motionless
in
his
sleep
,
it
was
past
their
usual
time
of
rising
.
<EOS>
Still
,
as
it
was
new
year
's
Day
,
a
time
of
some
licence
,
Philip
had
mercy
on
his
fellow
-
shopman
,
and
did
not
waken
him
till
just
as
he
was
leaving
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
Carrying
his
shoes
in
his
hand
,
he
went
softly
downstairs
for
he
could
see
from
the
top
of
the
flight
that
neither
Alice
nor
her
daughter
was
down
yet
,
as
the
kitchen
shutters
were
not
unclosed
.
<EOS>
It
was
Mrs.
Rose
's
habit
to
rise
early
,
and
have
all
bright
and
clean
against
her
lodgers
came
down
;
but
then
,
in
general
,
she
went
to
rest
before
nine
o'clock
,
whereas
the
last
night
she
had
not
gone
till
past
twelve
.
<EOS>
Philip
went
about
undoing
the
shutters
,
and
trying
to
break
up
the
raking
coal
,
with
as
little
noise
as
might
be
,
for
he
had
compassion
on
the
tired
sleepers
.
<EOS>
The
kettle
had
not
been
filled
,
probably
because
Mrs.
Rose
had
been
unable
to
face
the
storm
of
the
night
before
,
in
taking
it
to
the
pump
just
at
the
entrance
of
the
court
.
<EOS>
When
Philip
came
back
from
filling
it
,
he
found
Alice
and
Hester
both
in
the
kitchen
,
and
trying
to
make
up
for
lost
time
by
hastening
over
their
work
.
<EOS>
Hester
looked
busy
and
notable
with
her
gown
pinned
up
behind
her
,
and
her
hair
all
tucked
away
under
a
clean
linen
cap
;
but
Alice
was
angry
with
herself
for
her
late
sleeping
,
and
that
and
other
causes
made
her
speak
crossly
to
Philip
,
as
he
came
in
with
his
snowy
feet
and
well
-
filled
kettle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
the
'
there
!
<EOS>
droppin
'
and
drippin
'
along
t
'
flags
as
was
cleaned
last
night
,
and
meddlin
'
<EOS>
wi
'
woman
's
work
as
a
man
has
no
business
wi
'
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
was
surprised
and
annoyed
.
<EOS>
He
had
found
relief
from
his
own
thoughts
in
doing
what
he
believed
would
help
others
.
<EOS>
He
gave
up
the
kettle
to
her
snatching
hands
,
and
sate
down
behind
the
door
in
momentary
ill
-
temper
.
<EOS>
But
the
kettle
was
better
filled
,
and
consequently
heavier
than
the
old
woman
expected
,
and
she
could
not
manage
to
lift
it
to
the
crook
from
which
it
generally
hung
suspended
.
<EOS>
She
looked
round
for
Hester
,
but
she
was
gone
into
the
back
-
kitchen
.
<EOS>
In
a
minute
Philip
was
at
her
side
,
and
had
heaved
it
to
its
place
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
looked
in
his
face
for
a
moment
wistfully
,
but
hardly
condescended
to
thank
him
;
at
least
the
sound
of
the
words
did
not
pass
the
lips
that
formed
them
.
<EOS>
Rebuffed
by
her
manner
,
he
went
back
to
his
old
seat
,
and
mechanically
watched
the
preparations
for
breakfast
;
but
his
thoughts
went
back
to
the
night
before
,
and
the
comparative
ease
of
his
heart
was
gone
.
<EOS>
The
first
stir
of
a
new
day
had
made
him
feel
as
if
he
had
had
no
sufficient
cause
for
his
annoyance
and
despondency
the
previous
evening
;
but
now
,
condemned
to
sit
quiet
,
he
reviewed
looks
and
words
,
and
saw
just
reason
for
his
anxiety
.
<EOS>
After
some
consideration
he
resolved
to
go
that
very
night
to
Haytersbank
,
and
have
some
talk
with
either
Sylvia
or
her
mother
;
what
the
exact
nature
of
this
purposed
conversation
should
be
,
he
did
not
determine
;
much
would
depend
on
Sylvia
's
manner
and
mood
,
and
on
her
mother
's
state
of
health
;
but
at
any
rate
something
would
be
learnt
.
  
<EOS>
During
breakfast
something
was
learnt
nearer
home
;
though
not
all
that
a
man
less
unconscious
and
more
vain
than
Philip
might
have
discovered
.
<EOS>
He
only
found
out
that
Mrs.
Rose
was
displeased
with
him
for
not
having
gone
to
the
watch
-
night
with
Hester
,
according
to
the
plan
made
some
weeks
before
.
<EOS>
But
he
soothed
his
conscience
by
remembering
that
he
had
made
no
promise
;
he
had
merely
spoken
of
his
wish
to
be
present
at
the
service
,
about
which
Hester
was
speaking
;
and
although
at
the
time
and
for
a
good
while
afterwards
,
he
had
fully
intended
going
,
yet
as
there
had
been
William
Coulson
to
accompany
her
,
his
absence
could
not
have
been
seriously
noticed
.
<EOS>
Still
he
was
made
uncomfortable
by
Mrs.
Rose
's
change
of
manner
;
once
or
twice
he
said
to
himself
that
she
little
knew
how
miserable
he
had
been
during
his
"
gay
evening
,
"
as
she
would
persist
in
calling
it
,
or
she
would
not
talk
at
him
with
such
persevering
bitterness
this
morning
.
<EOS>
Before
he
left
for
the
shop
,
he
spoke
of
his
intention
of
going
to
see
how
his
aunt
was
,
and
of
paying
her
a
new
year
's
day
visit
.
  
<EOS>
Hepburn
and
Coulson
took
it
in
turns
week
and
week
about
to
go
first
home
to
dinner
;
the
one
who
went
first
sate
down
with
Mrs.
Rose
and
her
daughter
,
instead
of
having
his
portion
put
in
the
oven
to
keep
warm
for
him
.
<EOS>
To
-
day
it
was
Hepburn
's
turn
to
be
last
.
<EOS>
All
morning
the
shop
was
full
with
customers
,
come
rather
to
offer
good
wishes
than
to
buy
,
and
with
an
unspoken
remembrance
of
the
cake
and
wine
which
the
two
hospitable
brothers
Foster
made
a
point
of
offering
to
all
comers
on
new
year
's
day
.
<EOS>
It
was
busy
work
for
all
 
for
Hester
on
her
side
,
where
caps
,
ribbons
,
and
women
's
gear
were
exclusively
sold
 
for
the
shopmen
and
boys
in
the
grocery
and
drapery
department
.
<EOS>
Philip
was
trying
to
do
his
business
with
his
mind
far
away
;
and
the
consequence
was
that
his
manner
was
not
such
as
to
recommend
him
to
the
customers
,
some
of
whom
recollected
it
as
very
different
,
courteous
and
attentive
,
if
grave
and
sedate
.
<EOS>
One
buxom
farmer
's
wife
noticed
the
change
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
little
girl
with
her
,
of
about
five
years
old
,
that
she
had
lifted
up
on
the
counter
,
and
who
was
watching
Philip
with
anxious
eyes
,
occasionally
whispering
in
her
mother
's
ear
,
and
then
hiding
her
face
against
her
cloak
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
thought
a
deal
o
'
coming
to
see
yo
'
,
and
a
dunnot
think
as
yo
'
mind
her
at
all
.
<EOS>
My
pretty
,
he
's
clean
forgotten
as
how
he
said
last
new
year
's
day
,
he
'd
gi
'
thee
a
barley
-
sugar
stick
,
if
thou'd
hem
him
a
handkercher
by
this
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
child
's
face
was
buried
in
the
comfortable
breadth
of
duffle
at
these
words
,
while
the
little
outstretched
hand
held
a
small
square
of
coarse
linen
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
she
's
noane
forgotten
it
,
and
has
done
her
five
stitches
a
day
,
bless
her
;
and
a
dunnot
believe
as
yo
'
know
her
again
.
<EOS>
She
's
Phoebe
Moorsom
,
and
a'm
Hannah
,
and
a've
<EOS>
dealt
at
t
'
shop
reg'lar
this
fifteen
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
very
sorry
,
"
said
Philip
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
up
late
last
night
,
and
I
'm
a
bit
dazed
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
this
is
nice
work
,
Phoebe
,
and
I
'm
sure
I
'm
very
much
beholden
to
yo
'
.
<EOS>
And
here
's
five
sticks
<EOS>
o
'
barley
-
sugar
,
one
for
every
stitch
,
and
thank
you
kindly
,
Mrs.
Moorsom
,
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
took
the
handkerchief
and
hoped
he
had
made
honourable
amends
for
his
want
of
recognition
.
<EOS>
But
the
wee
lassie
refused
to
be
lifted
down
,
and
whispered
something
afresh
into
her
mother
's
ear
,
who
smiled
and
bade
her
be
quiet
.
<EOS>
Philip
saw
,
however
,
that
there
was
some
wish
ungratified
on
the
part
of
the
little
maiden
which
he
was
expected
to
inquire
into
,
and
,
accordingly
,
he
did
his
duty
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
a
little
fool
;
she
says
yo
'
promised
to
gi'e
her
a
kiss
,
and
t
'
make
her
yo'r
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
child
burrowed
her
face
closer
into
her
mother
's
neck
,
and
refused
to
allow
the
kiss
which
Philip
willingly
offered
.
<EOS>
All
he
could
do
was
to
touch
the
back
of
the
little
white
fat
neck
with
his
lips
.
<EOS>
The
mother
carried
her
off
only
half
satisfied
,
and
Philip
felt
that
he
must
try
and
collect
his
scattered
wits
,
and
be
more
alive
to
the
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
Towards
the
dinner
-
hour
the
crowd
slackened
;
Hester
began
to
replenish
decanters
and
bottles
,
and
to
bring
out
a
fresh
cake
before
she
went
home
to
dinner
;
and
Coulson
and
Philip
looked
over
the
joint
present
they
always
made
to
her
on
this
day
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
silk
handkerchief
of
the
prettiest
colours
they
could
pick
out
of
the
shop
,
intended
for
her
to
wear
round
her
neck
.
<EOS>
Each
tried
to
persuade
the
other
to
give
it
to
her
,
for
each
was
shy
of
the
act
of
presentation
.
<EOS>
Coulson
was
,
however
,
the
most
resolute
;
and
when
she
returned
from
the
parlour
the
little
parcel
was
in
Philip
's
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
,
Hester
,
"
said
he
,
going
round
the
counter
to
her
,
just
as
she
was
leaving
the
shop
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
from
Coulson
and
me
;
a
handkerchief
for
yo
'
to
wear
;
and
we
wish
yo
'
a
happy
New
Year
,
and
plenty
on
'em
;
and
there
's
many
<EOS>
a
one
wishes
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
took
her
hand
as
he
said
this
.
<EOS>
She
went
a
little
paler
,
and
her
eyes
brightened
as
though
they
would
fill
with
tears
as
they
met
his
;
she
could
not
have
helped
it
,
do
what
she
would
.
<EOS>
But
she
only
said
,
"
Thank
yo
'
kindly
,
"
and
going
up
to
Coulson
she
repeated
the
words
and
action
to
him
;
and
then
they
went
off
together
to
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
lull
of
business
for
the
next
hour
.
<EOS>
John
and
Jeremiah
were
dining
like
the
rest
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
Even
the
elder
errand
-
boy
had
vanished
.
<EOS>
Philip
rearranged
disorderly
goods
;
and
then
sate
down
on
the
counter
by
the
window
;
it
was
the
habitual
place
for
the
one
who
stayed
behind
;
for
excepting
on
market
-
day
there
was
little
or
no
custom
during
the
noon
-
hour
.
<EOS>
Formerly
he
used
to
move
the
drapery
with
which
the
window
was
ornamented
,
and
watch
the
passers
-
by
with
careless
eye
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
though
he
seemed
to
gaze
abroad
,
he
saw
nothing
but
vacancy
.
<EOS>
All
the
morning
since
he
got
up
<EOS>
he
had
been
trying
to
fight
through
his
duties
 
leaning
against
a
hope
 
<EOS>
a
hope
that
first
had
bowed
,
and
then
had
broke
as
soon
as
he
really
tried
its
weight
.
<EOS>
There
was
not
a
sign
of
Sylvia
's
liking
for
him
to
be
gathered
from
the
most
careful
recollection
of
the
past
evening
.
<EOS>
It
was
of
no
use
thinking
that
there
was
.
<EOS>
It
was
better
to
give
it
up
altogether
and
at
once
.
<EOS>
But
what
if
he
could
not
?
<EOS>
What
if
the
thought
of
her
was
bound
up
with
his
life
;
and
that
once
torn
out
by
his
own
free
will
,
the
very
roots
of
his
heart
must
come
also
?
  
<EOS>
No
<EOS>
;
he
was
resolved
he
would
go
on
;
as
long
as
there
was
life
there
was
hope
;
as
long
as
Sylvia
remained
unpledged
to
any
one
else
,
there
was
a
chance
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
remodel
his
behaviour
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
be
merry
and
light
-
hearted
like
other
young
men
;
his
nature
was
not
cast
in
that
mould
;
and
the
early
sorrows
that
had
left
him
a
lonely
orphan
might
have
matured
,
but
had
not
enlivened
,
his
character
.
<EOS>
He
thought
with
some
bitterness
on
the
power
of
easy
talking
about
trifles
which
some
of
those
he
had
met
with
at
the
Corneys
'
had
exhibited
.
<EOS>
But
then
he
felt
stirring
within
him
a
force
of
enduring
love
which
he
believed
to
be
unusual
,
and
which
seemed
as
if
it
must
compel
all
things
to
his
wish
in
the
end
.
<EOS>
A
year
or
so
ago
he
had
thought
much
of
his
own
cleverness
and
his
painfully
acquired
learning
,
and
he
had
imagined
that
these
were
the
qualities
which
were
to
gain
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
whether
he
had
tried
them
and
had
failed
to
win
even
her
admiration
,
or
whether
some
true
instinct
had
told
him
that
a
woman
's
love
may
be
gained
in
many
ways
sooner
than
by
mere
learning
,
he
was
only
angry
with
himself
for
his
past
folly
in
making
himself
her
school
 
nay
,
her
taskmaster
.
<EOS>
To
-
night
,
though
,
he
would
start
off
on
a
new
tack
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
even
upbraid
her
for
her
conduct
the
night
before
;
he
had
shown
her
his
displeasure
at
the
time
;
but
she
should
see
how
tender
and
forgiving
he
could
be
.
<EOS>
He
would
lure
her
to
him
rather
than
find
fault
with
her
.
<EOS>
There
had
perhaps
been
too
much
of
that
already
.
  
<EOS>
When
Coulson
came
back
Philip
went
to
his
solitary
dinner
.
<EOS>
In
general
he
was
quite
alone
while
eating
it
;
but
to
-
day
Alice
Rose
chose
to
bear
him
company
.
<EOS>
She
watched
him
with
cold
severe
eye
for
some
time
,
until
he
had
appeased
his
languid
appetite
.
<EOS>
Then
she
began
with
the
rebuke
she
had
in
store
for
him
;
a
rebuke
the
motives
to
which
were
not
entirely
revealed
even
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thou
're
none
so
keen
after
thy
food
as
common
,
"
she
began
.
<EOS>
"
Plain
victuals
goes
ill
down
after
feastin
'
.
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
felt
the
colour
mount
to
his
face
;
he
was
not
in
the
mood
for
patiently
standing
the
brunt
of
the
attack
which
he
saw
was
coming
,
and
yet
he
had
a
reverent
feeling
for
woman
and
for
age
.
<EOS>
He
wished
she
would
leave
him
alone
;
but
he
only
said
 
"
I
had
nought
but
a
slice
o
'
cold
beef
for
supper
,
if
you
'll
call
that
feasting
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Neither
do
godly
ways
savour
delicately
after
the
pleasures
of
the
world
,
"
continued
she
,
unheeding
his
speech
.
"
<EOS>
Thou
wert
wo
nt
to
seek
the
house
of
the
Lord
,
and
I
thought
well
on
thee
;
but
of
late
thou'st
changed
,
and
fallen
away
,
and
I
mun
speak
what
is
in
my
heart
towards
thee
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
"
said
Philip
,
impatiently
(
both
he
and
Coulson
called
Alice
"
mother
"
at
times
)
,
"
I
do
n't
think
I
am
fallen
away
,
and
any
way
I
can
not
stay
now
to
be
 
<EOS>
it
's
new
year
's
Day
,
and
t
'
shop
is
throng
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
Alice
held
up
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Her
speech
was
ready
,
and
she
must
deliver
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shop
here
,
shop
there
.
<EOS>
The
flesh
and
the
devil
are
gettin
'
hold
on
yo
'
,
and
yo
'
need
more
nor
iver
to

<EOS>
New
year
's
day
comes
and
says
,
"
Watch
and
pray
,
"
and
yo
'
say
,
"
Nay
,
I
'll
seek
feasts
and
market
-
places
,
and
let
times
and
seasons
come
and
go
without
heedin
'
into
whose
presence
they
're
hastening
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Time
was
,
Philip
,
when
thou'd
niver
ha
'
letten
a
merry
-
making
keep
thee
fra
'
t

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
yo
'
it
was
no
merry
-
making
to
me
,
"
said
Philip
,
with
sharpness
,
as
he
left
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
sat
down
on
the
nearest
seat
,
and
leant
her
head
on
her
wrinkled
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
tangled
and
snared
,
"
said
she
;
"
my
heart
has
yearned
after
him
,
and
I
esteemed
him
as
one
o
'
the
elect
.
<EOS>
And
more
nor
me
yearns
after
him
.
<EOS>
O
Lord
,
I
have
but
one
child

<EOS>
O
Lord
,
spare
her
!
<EOS>
But
o'er
and
above
a
'
<EOS>
I
would
like
to
pray
for
his
soul
,
that
Satan
might
not
have
it
,
for
he
came
to
me
but
a
little
lad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
At
that
moment
Philip
,
smitten
by
his
conscience
for
his
hard
manner
of
speech
,
came
back
;
but
Alice
did
not
hear
or
see
him
till
he
was
close
by
her
,
and
then
he
had
to
touch
her
to
recall
her
attention
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
was
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
'm
fretted
by
many
things
.
<EOS>
I
should
n't
ha
'
spoken
so
.
<EOS>
It
was
ill
-
done
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
lad
!
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
looking
up
and
putting
her
thin
arm
on
his
shoulder
as
he
stooped
<EOS>
,
"
Satan
is
desiring
after
yo
'
that
he
may
sift
yo
'
as
wheat
.
<EOS>
Bide
at
whoam
,
bide
at
whoam
,
and
go
not
after
them
as
care
nought
for
holy
things
.
<EOS>
Why
need
yo
'
go
to
Haytersbank
this
night
?
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
reddened
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
and
would
not
give
it
up
,
and
yet
it
was
difficult
to
resist
the
pleading
of
the
usually
stern
old
woman
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
said
he
,
withdrawing
himself
ever
so
little
from
her
hold
;
"
my
aunt
is
but
ailing
,
they
're
my
own
flesh
and
blood
,
and
as
good
folks
as
needs
be
,
though
they
may
n't
be
o
'
<EOS>
our
 
o
'
<EOS>
your
way
o
'
thinking
in
a
'
things
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Our
ways
 
your
ways
o
'
thinking
,
says
he
,
as
if
they
were
no
longer
his'n
.
<EOS>
And
as
good
folks
as
need
be
,
"
repeated
she
,
with
returning
severity
.
<EOS>
"
Them
's
Satan
's
words
,
<EOS>
tho
'
yo
'
spoke
'em
,
Philip
.
<EOS>
I
can
do
nought
again
Satan
,
but
I
can
speak
to
them
as
can
;
an
'
we
'll
see
which
pulls
hardest
,
for
it
'll
be
better
for
thee
to
be
riven
and
rent
i
'
twain
than
to
go
body
and
soul
to
hell
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
do
n't
think
,
mother
,
"
said
Philip
,
his
last
words
of
conciliation
,
for
the
clock
had
given
warning
for
two
,
"
as
I
'm
boun
'
for
hell
,
just
because
I
go
t
'
see
my
own
folks
<EOS>
,
all
I
ha
'
left
o
'
kin
.
"
<EOS>
And
once
more
,
after
laying
his
hand
with
as
much
of
a
caress
as
was
in
his
nature
on
hers
,
he
left
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Probably
Alice
would
have
considered
the
first
words
that
greeted
Philip
on
his
entrance
into
the
shop
as
an
answer
to
her
prayer
,
for
they
were
such
as
put
a
stop
to
his
plan
of
going
to
see
Sylvia
that
evening
;
and
if
Alice
had
formed
her
inchoate
thoughts
into
words
,
Sylvia
would
have
appeared
as
the
nearest
earthly
representative
of
the
spirit
of
temptation
whom
she
dreaded
for
Philip
.
  
<EOS>
As
he
took
his
place
behind
the
counter
,
Coulson
said
to
him
in
a
low
voice
,
    
"
<EOS>
Jeremiah
Foster
has
been
round
to
bid
us
to
sup
wi
'
him
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
He
says
that
he
and
John
have
a
little
matter
<EOS>
o
'
business
to
talk
over
with
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
glance
from
his
eyes
to
Philip
told
the
latter
that
Coulson
believed
the
business
spoken
of
had
something
to
do
with
the
partnership
,
respecting
which
there
had
been
a
silent
intelligence
for
some
time
between
the
shopmen
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
did
thou
say
?
"
asked
Philip
,
doggedly
unwilling
,
even
yet
,
to
give
up
his
purposed
visit
.
  
<EOS>
"
Say
!
<EOS>
why
,
what
could
a
say
,
but
that
we
'd
come
?
<EOS>
There
was
summat
up
,
for
sure
;
and
summat
as
he
thought
we
should
be
glad
on
.
<EOS>
I
could
tell
it
fra
<EOS>
'
t
'
look
on
his
face
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
as
I
can
go
,
"
said
Philip
,
feeling
just
then
as
if
the
long
-
hoped
-
for
partnership
was
as
nothing
compared
to
his
plan
.
<EOS>
It
was
always
distasteful
to
him
to
have
to
give
up
a
project
,
or
to
disarrange
an
intended
order
of
things
,
such
was
his
nature
;
but
to
-
day
it
was
absolute
pain
to
yield
his
own
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
man
alive
?
"
said
Coulson
,
in
amaze
at
his
reluctance
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
say
I
might
n't
go
,
"
said
Philip
,
weighing
consequences
,
until
called
off
to
attend
to
customers
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
the
afternoon
,
however
,
he
felt
himself
more
easy
in
deferring
his
visit
to
Haytersbank
till
the
next
evening
.
<EOS>
Charley
Kinraid
entered
the
shop
,
accompanied
by
Molly
Brunton
and
her
sisters
;
and
though
they
all
went
towards
Hester
's
side
of
the
shop
,
and
Philip
and
Coulson
had
many
people
to
attend
to
,
yet
Hepburn
's
sharpened
ears
caught
much
of
what
the
young
women
were
saying
.
<EOS>
From
that
he
gathered
that
Kinraid
had
promised
them
new
year
's
gifts
,
for
the
purchase
of
which
they
were
come
;
and
after
a
little
more
listening
he
learnt
that
Kinraid
was
returning
to
Shields
the
next
day
,
having
only
come
over
to
spend
a
holiday
with
his
relations
,
and
being
tied
with
ship
's
work
at
the
other
end
.
<EOS>
They
all
talked
together
lightly
and
merrily
,
as
if
his
going
or
staying
was
almost
a
matter
of
indifference
to
himself
and
his
cousins
.
<EOS>
The
principal
thought
of
the
young
women
was
to
secure
the
articles
they
most
fancied
;
Charley
Kinraid
was
(
so
Philip
thought
)
especially
anxious
that
the
youngest
and
prettiest
should
be
pleased
.
<EOS>
Hepburn
watched
him
perpetually
with
a
kind
of
envy
of
his
bright
,
courteous
manner
,
the
natural
gallantry
of
the
sailor
.
<EOS>
If
it
were
but
clear
that
Sylvia
took
as
little
thought
of
him
as
he
did
of
her
,
to
all
appearance
,
Philip
could
even
have
given
him
praise
for
manly
good
looks
,
and
a
certain
kind
of
geniality
of
disposition
which
made
him
ready
to
smile
pleasantly
at
all
strangers
,
from
babies
upwards
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
party
turned
to
leave
the
shop
they
saw
Philip
,
the
guest
of
the
night
before
;
and
they
came
over
to
shake
hands
with
him
across
the
counter
;
Kinraid
's
hand
was
proffered
among
the
number
.
<EOS>
Last
night
Philip
could
not
have
believed
it
possible
that
such
a
demonstration
of
fellowship
should
have
passed
between
them
;
and
perhaps
there
was
a
slight
hesitation
of
manner
on
his
part
,
for
some
idea
or
remembrance
<EOS>
crossed
Kinraid
's
mind
which
brought
a
keen
searching
glance
into
the
eyes
which
for
a
moment
were
fastened
on
Philip
's
face
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
himself
,
and
during
the
very
action
of
hand
-
shaking
,
Philip
felt
a
cloud
come
over
his
face
,
not
altering
or
moving
his
features
,
but
taking
light
and
peace
out
of
his
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
Molly
Brunton
began
to
say
something
,
and
he
gladly
turned
to
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
asking
him
why
he
went
away
so
early
,
for
they
had
kept
it
up
for
four
hours
after
he
left
,
and
last
of
all
,
she
added
(
turning
to
Kinraid
)
,
her
cousin
Charley
had
danced
a
hornpipe
among
the
platters
on
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
hardly
knew
what
he
said
in
reply
,
the
mention
of
that
pas
seul
lifted
such
a
weight
off
his
heart
.
<EOS>
He
could
smile
now
,
after
his
grave
fashion
,
and
would
have
shaken
hands
again
with
Kinraid
had
it
been
required
;
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
no
one
,
caring
ever
so
little
in
the
way
that
he
did
for
Sylvia
,
could
have
borne
four
mortal
hours
of
a
company
where
she
had
been
,
and
was
not
;
least
of
all
could
have
danced
a
hornpipe
,
either
from
gaiety
of
heart
,
or
even
out
of
complaisance
.
<EOS>
He
felt
as
if
the
yearning
after
the
absent
one
would
have
been
a
weight
to
his
legs
,
as
well
as
to
his
spirit
;
and
he
imagined
that
all
men
were
like
himself
.
    
<EOS>
PARTNERSHIP
  
<EOS>
As
darkness
closed
in
,
and
the
New
Year
's
throng
became
scarce
,
Philip
's
hesitation
about
accompanying
Coulson
faded
away
.
<EOS>
He
was
more
comfortable
respecting
Sylvia
,
and
his
going
to
see
her
might
be
deferred
;
and
,
after
all
,
he
felt
that
the
wishes
of
his
masters
ought
to
be
attended
to
,
and
the
honour
of
an
invitation
to
the
private
house
of
Jeremiah
not
to
be
slighted
for
anything
short
of
a
positive
engagement
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
the
ambitious
man
of
business
existed
strongly
in
Philip
.
<EOS>
It
would
never
do
to
slight
advances
towards
the
second
great
earthly
object
in
his
life
;
one
also
on
which
the
first
depended
.
  
<EOS>
So
when
the
shop
was
closed
,
the
two
set
out
down
Bridge
Street
to
cross
the
river
to
the
house
of
Jeremiah
Foster
.
<EOS>
They
stood
a
moment
on
the
bridge
to
breathe
the
keen
fresh
sea
air
after
their
busy
day
.
<EOS>
The
waters
came
down
,
swollen
full
and
dark
,
with
rapid
rushing
speed
from
the
snow
-
fed
springs
high
up
on
the
moorland
above
.
<EOS>
The
close
-
packed
houses
in
the
old
town
seemed
a
cluster
of
white
roofs
irregularly
piled
against
the
more
unbroken
white
of
the
hill
-
side
.
<EOS>
Lights
twinkled
here
and
there
in
the
town
,
and
were
slung
from
stern
and
bow
of
the
ships
in
the
harbour
.
<EOS>
The
air
was
very
still
,
settling
in
for
a
frost
;
so
still
that
all
distant
sounds
seemed
near
:
the
rumble
of
a
returning
cart
in
the
High
Street
,
the
voices
on
board
ship
,
the
closing
of
shutters
and
barring
of
doors
in
the
new
town
to
which
they
were
bound
.
<EOS>
But
the
sharp
air
was
filled
,
as
it
were
,
with
saline
particles
in
a
freezing
state
;
little
pungent
crystals
of
sea
salt
burning
lips
and
cheeks
with
their
cold
keenness
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
do
to
linger
here
in
the
very
centre
of
the
valley
up
which
passed
the
current
of
atmosphere
coming
straight
with
the
rushing
tide
from
the
icy
northern
seas
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
there
was
the
unusual
honour
of
a
supper
with
Jeremiah
Foster
awaiting
them
.
<EOS>
He
had
asked
each
of
them
separately
to
a
meal
before
now
;
but
they
had
never
gone
together
,
and
they
felt
that
there
was
something
serious
in
the
conjuncture
.
  
<EOS>
They
began
to
climb
the
steep
heights
leading
to
the
freshly
-
built
rows
of
the
new
town
of
Monkshaven
,
feeling
as
if
they
were
rising
into
aristocratic
regions
where
no
shop
profaned
the
streets
.
<EOS>
Jeremiah
Foster
's
house
was
one
of
six
,
undistinguished
in
size
,
or
shape
,
or
colour
;
but
noticed
in
the
daytime
by
all
passers
-
by
for
its
spotless
cleanliness
of
lintel
and
doorstep
,
window
and
window
frame
.
<EOS>
The
very
bricks
seemed
as
though
they
came
in
for
the
daily
scrubbing
which
brightened
handle
,
knocker
,
all
down
to
the
very
scraper
.
  
<EOS>
The
two
young
men
felt
as
shy
of
the
interview
with
their
master
under
such
unusual
relations
of
guest
and
host
,
as
a
girl
does
of
her
first
party
.
<EOS>
Each
rather
drew
back
from
the
decided
step
of
knocking
at
the
door
;
but
with
a
rebuffing
shake
at
his
own
folly
,
Philip
was
the
one
to
give
a
loud
single
rap
.
<EOS>
As
if
they
had
been
waited
for
,
the
door
flew
open
,
and
a
middle
-
aged
servant
stood
behind
,
as
spotless
and
neat
as
the
house
itself
;
and
smiled
a
welcome
to
the
familiar
faces
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
dust
yo
'
a
bit
,
William
,
"
said
she
,
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
.
<EOS>
"
You
've
been
leanin
'
again
some
whitewash
,
a'll
be
bound
.
<EOS>
Ay
,
Philip
,
"
continued
she
,
turning
him
round
with
motherly
freedom
,
"
yo'll
do
if
yo'll
but
gi
<EOS>
'
your
shoon
a
polishin
'
wipe
on
yon
other
mat
.
<EOS>
This'n
for
takin
'
t
'
roughest
mud
off
.
<EOS>
Measter
allays
polishes
on
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
the
square
parlour
the
same
precise
order
was
observed
.
<EOS>
Every
article
of
furniture
was
free
from
speck
of
dirt
or
particle
of
dust
;
and
everything
was
placed
either
in
a
parallel
line
,
or
at
exact
right
-
angles
with
every
other
.
<EOS>
Even
John
and
Jeremiah
sat
in
symmetry
on
opposite
sides
of
the
fire
-
place
;
the
very
smiles
on
their
honest
faces
seemed
drawn
to
a
line
of
exactitude
.
  
<EOS>
Such
formality
,
however
admirable
,
was
not
calculated
to
promote
ease
:
it
was
not
until
after
supper
 
until
a
good
quantity
of
Yorkshire
pie
had
been
swallowed
,
and
washed
down
,
too
,
with
the
best
and
most
generous
wine
in
Jeremiah
's
cellar
 
that
there
was
the
least
geniality
among
them
,
in
spite
of
the
friendly
kindness
of
the
host
and
his
brother
.
<EOS>
The
long
silence
,
during
which
mute
thanks
for
the
meal
were
given
,
having
come
to
an
end
,
Jeremiah
called
for
pipes
,
and
three
of
the
party
began
to
smoke
.
  
<EOS>
Politics
in
those
days
were
tickle
subjects
to
meddle
with
,
even
in
the
most
private
company
.
<EOS>
The
nation
was
in
a
state
of
terror
against
France
,
and
against
any
at
home
who
might
be
supposed
to
sympathise
with
the
enormities
she
had
just
been
committing
.
<EOS>
The
oppressive
act
against
seditious
meetings
had
been
passed
the
year
before
;
and
people
were
doubtful
to
what
extremity
of
severity
it
might
be
construed
.
<EOS>
Even
the
law
authorities
forgot
to
be
impartial
,
but
either
their
alarms
or
their
interests
made
too
many
of
them
vehement
partisans
instead
of
calm
arbiters
,
and
thus
destroyed
the
popular
confidence
in
what
should
have
been
considered
the
supreme
tribunal
of
justice
.
<EOS>
Yet
for
all
this
,
there
were
some
who
dared
to
speak
of
reform
of
Parliament
,
as
a
preliminary
step
to
fair
representation
of
the
people
,
and
to
a
reduction
of
the
heavy
war
-
taxation
that
was
imminent
,
if
not
already
imposed
.
<EOS>
But
these
pioneers
of
1830
were
generally
obnoxious
.
<EOS>
The
great
body
of
the
people
gloried
in
being
Tories
and
haters
of
the
French
,
with
whom
they
were
on
tenter
-
hooks
to
fight
,
almost
unaware
of
the
rising
reputation
of
the
young
Corsican
warrior
,
whose
name
would
be
used
ere
<EOS>
a
dozen
years
had
passed
to
hush
English
babies
with
a
terror
such
as
that
of
Marlborough
once
had
for
the
French
.
  
<EOS>
At
such
a
place
as
Monkshaven
all
these
opinions
were
held
in
excess
.
<EOS>
One
or
two
might
,
for
the
mere
sake
of
argument
,
dispute
on
certain
points
of
history
or
government
;
but
they
took
care
to
be
very
sure
of
their
listeners
before
such
arguments
touched
on
anything
of
the
present
day
;
for
it
had
been
not
unfrequently
found
that
the
public
duty
of
prosecuting
opinions
not
your
own
overrode
the
private
duty
of
respecting
confidence
.
<EOS>
Most
of
the
Monkshaven
politicians
confined
themselves
,
therefore
,
to
such
general
questions
as
these
:
"
Could
an
Englishman
lick
more
than
four
Frenchmen
at
a
time
?
"
<EOS>
"
What
was
the
proper
punishment
for
members
of
the
Corresponding
Society
(
correspondence
with
the
French
directory
)
,
hanging
and
quartering
,
or
burning
?
"
<EOS>
"
Would
the
forthcoming
child
of
the
Princess
of
Wales
be
a
boy
or
a
girl
?
<EOS>
If
a
girl
,
would
it
be
more
loyal
to
call
it
Charlotte
or
Elizabeth
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
Fosters
were
quite
secure
enough
of
their
guests
this
evening
to
have
spoken
freely
on
politics
had
they
been
so
inclined
.
<EOS>
And
they
did
begin
on
the
outrages
which
had
been
lately
offered
to
the
king
in
crossing
St
James
's
Park
to
go
and
open
the
House
of
Lords
;
but
soon
,
so
accustomed
were
their
minds
to
caution
and
restraint
,
the
talk
dropped
down
to
the
high
price
of
provisions
.
<EOS>
Bread

<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
per
quarter
,
as
the
home
-
baking
northerners
viewed
the
matter
;
and
then
the
conversation
died
away
to
an
ominous
silence
.
<EOS>
John
looked
at
Jeremiah
,
as
if
asking
him
to
begin
.
<EOS>
Jeremiah
was
the
host
,
and
had
been
a
married
man
.
<EOS>
Jeremiah
returned
the
look
with
the
same
meaning
in
it
.
<EOS>
John
,
though
a
bachelor
,
was
the
elder
brother
.
<EOS>
The
great
church
bell
,
brought
from
the
Monkshaven
monastery
centuries
ago
,
high
up
on
the
opposite
hill
-
side
,
began
to
ring
nine
o'clock
;
it
was
getting
late
.
<EOS>
Jeremiah
began
:
  
"
It
seems
a
bad
time
for
starting
any
one
on
business
,
wi
'
prices
and
taxes
and
bread
so
dear
;
but
John
and
I
are
getting
into
years
,
and
we
've
no
children
to
follow
us
:
yet
we
would
fain
draw
out
of
some
of
our
worldly
affairs
.
<EOS>
We
would
like
to
give
up
the
shop
,
and
stick
to
banking
,
to
which
there
seemeth
a
plain
path
.
<EOS>
But
first
there
is
the
stock
and
goodwill
of
the
shop
to
be
disposed
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
dead
pause
.
<EOS>
This
opening
was
not
favourable
to
the
hopes
of
the
two
moneyless
young
men
who
had
been
hoping
to
succeed
their
masters
by
the
more
gradual
process
of
partnership
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
only
the
kind
of
speech
that
had
been
agreed
upon
by
the
two
brothers
with
a
view
of
impressing
on
Hepburn
and
Coulson
the
great
and
unusual
responsibility
of
the
situation
into
which
the
Fosters
wished
them
to
enter
.
<EOS>
In
some
ways
the
talk
of
many
was
much
less
simple
and
straightforward
in
those
days
than
it
is
now
.
<EOS>
The
study
of
effect
shown
in
the
London
diners
-
out
of
the
last
generation
,
who
prepared
their
conversation
beforehand
,
was
not
without
its
parallel
in
humbler
spheres
,
and
for
different
objects
than
self
-
display
.
<EOS>
The
brothers
Foster
had
all
but
rehearsed
the
speeches
they
were
about
to
make
this
evening
.
<EOS>
They
were
aware
of
the
youth
of
the
parties
to
whom
they
were
going
to
make
a
most
favourable
proposal
;
and
they
dreaded
that
if
that
proposal
was
too
lightly
made
,
it
would
be
too
lightly
considered
,
and
the
duties
involved
in
it
too
carelessly
entered
upon
.
<EOS>
So
the
_
role
_
of
one
brother
was
to
suggest
,
that
of
the
other
to
repress
.
<EOS>
The
young
men
,
too
,
had
their
reserves
.
<EOS>
They
foresaw
,
and
had
long
foreseen
<EOS>
,
what
was
coming
that
evening
.
<EOS>
They
were
impatient
to
hear
it
in
distinct
words
;
and
yet
they
had
to
wait
,
as
if
unconscious
,
during
all
the
long
preamble
.
<EOS>
Do
age
and
youth
never
play
the
same
parts
now
?
<EOS>
To
return
.
<EOS>
John
Foster
replied
to
his
brother
:
  
"
The
stock
and
goodwill
!
<EOS>
That
would
take
much
wealth
.
<EOS>
And
there
will
be
fixtures
to
be
considered
.
<EOS>
Philip
,
canst
thee
tell
me
the
exact
amount
of
stock
in
the
shop
at
present
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
had
only
just
been
taken
;
Philip
had
it
at
his
fingers
'
ends
.
<EOS>
"
One
thousand
nine
hundred
and
forty
-
one
pounds
,
thirteen
shillings
and
twopence
.
"
  
Coulson
looked
at
him
in
a
little
dismay
,
and
could
not
repress
a
sigh
.
<EOS>
The
figures
put
into
words
and
spoken
aloud
seemed
to
indicate
so
much
larger
an
amount
of
money
than
when
quickly
written
down
in
numerals
.
<EOS>
But
Philip
read
the
countenances
,
nay
,
by
some
process
of
which
he
was
not
himself
aware
<EOS>
,
he
read
the
minds
of
the
brothers
,
and
felt
no
dismay
at
what
he
saw
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
the
fixtures
?
<EOS>
"
asked
John
Foster
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
appraiser
valued
them
at
four
hundred
and
thirty
-
five
pounds
three
and
sixpence
when
father
died
.
<EOS>
We
have
added
to
them
since
,
but
we
will
reckon
them
at
that
.
<EOS>
How
much
does
that
make
with
the
value
of
the
stock
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Two
thousand
one
hundred
and
seventy
-
six
pounds
,
sixteen
shillings
and
eightpence
,
"
said
Philip
.
  
<EOS>
Coulson
had
done
the
sum
quicker
,
but
was
too
much
disheartened
by
the
amount
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
the
goodwill
?
"
asked
the
pitiless
John
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
dost
thee
set
that
at
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
brother
,
that
that
would
depend
on
who
came
forward
with
the
purchase
-
money
of
the
stock
and
fixtures
.
<EOS>
To
some
folks
we
might
make
it
sit
easy
,
if
they
were
known
to
us
,
and
those
as
we
wished
well
to
.
<EOS>
If
Philip
and
William
here
,
for
instance
,
said
they
'd
like
to
purchase
the
business
,
I
reckon
thee
and
<EOS>
me
would
not
ask
'em
so
much
as
we
should
ask
Millers
'
(
Millers
was
an
upstart
petty
rival
shop
at
the
end
of
the
bridge
in
the
New
Town
)
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
Philip
and
William
was
to
come
after
us
,
"
said
John
.
<EOS>
"
But
that
's
out
of
the
question
,
"
he
continued
,
knowing
all
the
while
that
,
far
from
being
out
of
the
question
,
it
was
the
very
question
,
and
that
it
was
as
good
as
settled
at
this
very
time
.
  
<EOS>
No
one
spoke
.
<EOS>
Then
Jeremiah
went
on
:
  
"
<EOS>
It
's
out
of
the
question
,
I
reckon
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
at
the
two
young
men
.
<EOS>
Coulson
shook
his
head
.
<EOS>
Philip
more
bravely
said
,
    
"
I
have
fifty
-
three
pounds
seven
and
fourpence
in
yo'r
hands
,
Master
John
,
and
it
's
all
I
have
<EOS>
i
'
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
pity
,
"
said
John
,
and
again
they
were
silent
.
<EOS>
Half
-
past
nine
struck
.
<EOS>
It
was
time
to
be
beginning
to
make
an
end
.
"
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
brother
,
they
have
friends
who
could
advance
'em
the
money
.
<EOS>
We
might
make
it
sit
light
to
them
,
for
the
sake
of
their
good
service
?
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
replied
,
    
"
There
's
no
one
who
can
put
forwards
a
penny
for
me
:
<EOS>
I
have
but
few
kin
,
and
they
have
little
to
spare
beyond
what
they
need
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Coulson
said
    
"
My
father
and
mother
have
nine
on
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
alone
,
let
alone
!
"
said
John
,
relenting
fast
;
for
he
was
weary
of
his
part
of
cold
,
stern
prudence
.
<EOS>
"
Brother
,
I
think
we
have
enough
of
this
world
's
goods
to
do
what
we
like
wi
'
our
own
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jeremiah
was
a
little
scandalized
at
the
rapid
melting
away
of
assumed
character
,
and
took
a
good
pull
at
his
pipe
before
he
replied
    
<EOS>
"
Upwards
of
two
thousand
pounds
is
a
large
sum
to
set
on
the
well
-
being
and
well
-
doing
of
two
lads
,
the
elder
of
whom
is
not
three
-
and
-
twenty
.
<EOS>
I
fear
we
must
look
farther
a
-
field
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
John
,
"
replied
Jeremiah
,
"
it
was
but
yesterday
thee
saidst
thee
would
rather
have
Philip
and
William
than
any
men
o
'
fifty
that
thee
knowed
.
<EOS>
And
now
to
bring
up
their
youth
again
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
well
!
<EOS>
t
'
half
on
it
is
thine
,
and
thou
shall
do
even
as
thou
wilt
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
as
I
must
have
security
for
my
moiety
,
for
it
's
a
risk
 
<EOS>
a
great
risk
.
<EOS>
Have
ye
any
security
to
offer
?
<EOS>
any
expectations
?
<EOS>
any
legacies
,
as
other
folk
have
a
life
-
interest
in
at
present
?
"
  
<EOS>
No
;
neither
of
them
had
.
<EOS>
So
Jeremiah
rejoined
    
"
<EOS>
Then
,
I
suppose
,
I
mun
do
as
thee
dost
,
John
,
and
take
the
security
of
character
.
<EOS>
And
it
's
a
great
security
too
,
lads
,
and
t
'
<EOS>
best
o
'
all
,
and
one
that
I
could
n't
ha
'
done
without
;
<EOS>
no
,
not
if
yo'd
pay
me
down
five
thousand
for
goodwill
,
and
stock
,
and
fixtures
.
<EOS>
For
John
Foster
and
Son
has
been
a
shop
<EOS>
i
'
Monkshaven
this
eighty
years
and
more
;
and
<EOS>
I
dunnot
think
there
's
a
man
living
 
or
dead
,
for
that
matter
 
as
can
say
Fosters
wronged
him
of
a
penny
,
or
gave
short
measure
to
a
child
or
a
Cousin
Betty
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
all
four
shook
hands
round
with
the
same
heartiness
as
if
it
had
been
a
legal
ceremony
necessary
to
the
completion
of
the
partnership
.
<EOS>
The
old
men
's
faces
were
bright
with
smiles
;
the
eyes
of
the
young
ones
sparkled
with
hope
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
after
all
,
"
said
Jeremiah
,
"
we
've
not
told
you
particulars
.
<EOS>
Yo're
thanking
us
for
a
pig
in
a
poke
;
but
we
had
more
forethought
,
and
we
put
all
down
on
a
piece
o
'
paper
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
took
down
a
folded
piece
of
paper
from
the
mantel
-
shelf
,
put
on
his
horn
spectacles
,
and
began
to
read
aloud
,
occasionally
peering
over
his
glasses
to
note
the
effect
on
the
countenances
of
the
young
men
.
<EOS>
The
only
thing
he
was
in
the
habit
of
reading
aloud
was
a
chapter
in
the
Bible
daily
to
his
housekeeper
servant
;
and
,
like
many
,
he
reserved
a
peculiar
tone
for
that
solemn
occupation
 
a
tone
which
he
unconsciously
employed
for
the
present
enumeration
of
pounds
,
shillings
,
and
pence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Average

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
far
more
than
either
Hepburn
or
Coulson
had
imagined
it
to
be
;
and
a
look
of
surprise
,
almost
amounting
to
dismay
,
crept
over
their
faces
,
in
spite
of
their
endeavour
to
keep
simply
motionless
and
attentive
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
deal
of
money
,
lads
,
and
the
Lord
<EOS>
give
you
grace
to
guide
it

"
said
Jeremiah
,
putting
down
his
paper
for
a
minute
.
  
<EOS>
"
Amen
,
"
said
John
,
shaking
his
head
to
give
effect
to
his
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
what
we
propose
is
this
,
"
continued
Jeremiah
,
beginning
afresh
to
refer
to
his
paper
:
"
We
will
call
t
'
value
of

two

<EOS>
You
may
have
John

in
to
set
a

on
them
if
yo

will
;

yo

may
look
over
books

;
or
,
better
still

do
both
,

so
check

but
for
t

o

making
<EOS>
the
ground
o
'
<EOS>
the
bargain

I
state
the
sum
as
above

I
reckon
it
so
much
capital
left
in

the

must
be
at
the
rate

paying

the

of
wharfage
,
warehouse
,
and
premises
,
is
reckoned
by
us
to
be
sixty
-
five
pound
per
annum
.
<EOS>
So
yo
'
will
have
to
pay
us
,
John
and
Jeremiah
Foster
,
brothers
,
six
hundred
and
twelve
pound
ten
out
of
the
profits
of
the
first
year
,
leaving
,
at
the
present
rate
of
profits
,
about
five
hundred
and
eighty
-
nine
pound
ten
,
for
the
share
to
be
divided
between
yo
'
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
plan
had
,
in
all
its
details
,
been
carefully
arranged
by
the
two
brothers
.
<EOS>
They
were
afraid
lest
Hepburn
and
Coulson
should
be
dazzled
by
the
amount
of
profits
,
and
had
so
arranged
the
sliding
-
scale
of
payment
as
to
reduce
the
first
year
's
income
to
what
the
elder
men
thought
a
very
moderate
sum
,
but
what
to
the
younger
ones
appeared
an
amount
of
wealth
such
as
they
,
who
had
neither
of
them
ever
owned
much
more
than
fifty
pounds
,
considered
almost
inexhaustible
.
<EOS>
It
was
certainly
a
remarkable
instance
of
prosperity
and
desert
meeting
together
so
early
in
life
.
  
<EOS>
For
a
moment
or
two
the
brothers
were
disappointed
at
not
hearing
any
reply
from
either
of
them
.
<EOS>
Then
Philip
stood
up
,
for
he
felt
as
if
anything
he
could
say
sitting
down
would
not
be
sufficiently
expressive
of
gratitude
,
and
William
instantly
followed
his
example
.
<EOS>
Hepburn
began
in
a
formal
manner
,
something
the
way
in
which
he
had
read
in
the
York
newspapers
that
honourable
members
returned
thanks
when
their
health
was
given
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
hardly
express
my
feelings
"
(
Coulson
nudged
him
)
"
<EOS>
his
feelings
,
too
 
of
gratitude
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Master
John
!
<EOS>
Master
Jeremiah
,
I
thought
it
might
come
i
'
time
;
nay
,
I
've
thought
it
might
come
afore
long
;
but
I
niver
thought
as
it
would
be
so
much
,
or
made
so
easy
.
<EOS>
We
've
got
good
kind
friends
 
<EOS>
we
have
,
have
we
not
,
William
?
 
<EOS>
and
we
'll
do
our
best
,
and
I
hope
as
we
shall
come
up
to
their
wishes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
's
voice
quivered
a
little
,
as
some
remembrance
passed
across
his
mind
;
at
this
unusual
moment
of
expansion
out
it
came
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
mother
could
ha
'
seen
this
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
shall
see
a
better
day
,
my
lad
,
when
thy
name
and
William
's
is
painted
over
t
'
shop
-
door
,
and
J.
and
J.
Foster
blacked
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
master
,
"
said
William
,
"
that
mun
never
be
.
<EOS>
I
'd
a'most
sooner
not
come
in
for
the
business
.
<EOS>
Anyhow
,
it
must
be
"
late
J.
and
J.
Foster
,
"
and
I
'm
not
sure
as
I
can
stomach
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
William
,
"
said
John
Foster
,
highly
gratified
,
"
there
be
time
enough
to
talk
over
that
.
<EOS>
There
was
one
thing
more
to
be
said
,
was
there
not
,
brother
Jeremiah
?
<EOS>
We
do
not
wish
to
have
this
talked
over
in
Monkshaven
until
shortly
before
the
time
when
yo
'
must
enter
on
the
business
.
<EOS>
We
have
our
own
arrangements
to
make
wi
'
regard
to
the
banking
concern
,
and
there
'll
be
lawyer
's
work
to
do
,
after
yo've
examined
books
and
looked
over
stock
again
together
;
may
-
be
we
've
overstated
it
,
or
t
'
fixtures
are
n't
worth
so
much
as
we
said
.
<EOS>
Anyhow
yo
'
must
each
on
yo
'
give
us
yo'r
word
for
to
keep
fra
'
naming
this
night
's
conversation
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
Jeremiah
and
I
will
have
to
pay
accounts
,
and
take
a
kind
of
farewell
of
the
merchants
and
manufacturers
with
whom
Fosters
have
had
dealings
this
seventy
or
eighty
year
;
and
when
and
where
it
seems
fitting
to
us
we
will
take
one
of
yo
'
to
introduce
as
our
successors
and
friends
.
<EOS>
But
all
that
's
to
come
.
<EOS>
But
yo
'
must
each
give
us
yo'r
word
not
to
name
what
has
passed
here
to
any
one
till
further
speech
on
the
subject
has
passed
between
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
Coulson
immediately
gave
the
promise
.
<EOS>
Philip
's
assent
came
lagging
.
<EOS>
He
had
thought
of
Sylvia
living
,
almost
as
much
as
of
the
dead
mother
,
whose
last
words
had
been
a
committal
of
her
child
to
the
Father
of
the
friendless
;
and
now
that
a
short
delay
was
placed
between
the
sight
of
the
cup
and
his
enjoyment
of
it
,
there
was
an
impatient
chafing
in
the
mind
of
the
composed
and
self
-
restrained
Philip
;
and
then
repentance
quick
as
lightning
effaced
the
feeling
,
and
he
pledged
himself
to
the
secrecy
which
was
enjoined
.
<EOS>
Some
few
more
details
as
to
their
mode
of
procedure
 
of
verifying
the
Fosters
'
statements
,
which
to
the
younger
men
seemed
a
perfectly
unnecessary
piece
of
business
 
of
probable
journeys
and
introductions
,
and
then
farewell
was
bidden
,
and
Hepburn
and
Coulson
were
in
the
passage
donning
their
wraps
,
and
rather
to
their
indignation
being
assisted
therein
by
Martha
,
who
was
accustomed
to
the
office
with
her
own
master
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
they
were
recalled
into
the
parlour
.
  
<EOS>
John
Foster
was
fumbling
with
the
papers
a
little
nervously
:
Jeremiah
spoke
    
<EOS>
"
We
have
not
thought
it
necessary
to
commend
Hester
Rose
to
you
;
if
she
had
been
a
lad
she
would
have
had
a
third
o
'
the
business
along
wi
'
yo
'
.
<EOS>
Being
a
woman
,
it
's
ill
troubling
her
with
a
partnership
;
better
give
her
a
fixed
salary
till
such
time
as
she
marries
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
a
little
knowingly
and
curiously
at
the
faces
of
the
young
men
he
addressed
.
<EOS>
William
Coulson
seemed
sheepish
and
uncomfortable
,
but
said
nothing
,
leaving
it
as
usual
to
Philip
to
be
spokesman
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
we
had
n't
cared
for
Hester
for
hersel
'
,
master
,
we
should
ha
'
cared
for
her
as
being
forespoken
by
yo
'
.
<EOS>
Yo
'
and
Master
John
shall
fix
what
we
ought
t
'
pay
her
;
and
I
think
I
may
make
bold
to
say
that
,
as
our
income
rises
,
hers
shall
too
 
eh
,
Coulson
?
"
(
a
sound
of
assent
quite
distinct
enough
)
;
"
for
we
both
look
on
her
as
a
sister
and
on
Alice
like
a
mother
,
as
I
told
her
only
this
very
day
.
"
      
<EOS>
A
DIFFICULT
QUESTION
  
<EOS>
Philip
went
to
bed
with
that
kind
of
humble
penitent
gratitude
in
his
heart
,
which
we
sometimes
feel
after
a
sudden
revulsion
of
feeling
from
despondency
to
hope
.
<EOS>
The
night
before
it
seemed
as
if
all
events
were
so
arranged
as
to
thwart
him
in
his
dearest
wishes
;
he
felt
now
as
if
his
discontent
and
repining
,
not
twenty
-
four
hours
before
,
had
been
almost
impious
,
<EOS>
so
great
was
the
change
in
his
circumstances
for
the
better
.
<EOS>
Now
all
seemed
promising
for
the
fulfilment
of
what
he
most
desired
.
<EOS>
He
was
almost
convinced
that
he
was
mistaken
in
thinking
that
Kinraid
had
had
anything
more
than
a
sailor
's
admiration
for
a
pretty
girl
with
regard
to
Sylvia
;
at
any
rate
,
he
was
going
away
to
-
morrow
,
in
all
probability
not
to
return
for
another
year
(
for
Greenland
ships
left
for
the
northern
seas
as
soon
as
there
was
a
chance
of
the
ice
being
broken
up
)
,
and
ere
then
he
himself
might
speak
out
openly
,
laying
before
her
parents
all
his
fortunate
prospects
,
and
before
her
all
his
deep
passionate
love
.
  
<EOS>
So
this
night
his
prayers
were
more
than
the
mere
form
that
they
had
been
the
night
before
;
they
were
a
vehement
expression
of
gratitude
to
God
for
having
,
as
it
were
,
interfered
on
his
behalf
,
to
grant
him
the
desire
of
his
eyes
and
the
lust
of
his
heart
.
<EOS>
He
was
like
too
many
of
us
,
he
did
not
place
his
future
life
in
the
hands
of
God
,
and
only
ask
for
grace
to
do
His
will
in
whatever
circumstances
might
arise
;
but
he
yearned
in
that
terrible
way
after
a
blessing
which
,
when
granted
under
such
circumstances
,
too
often
turns
out
to
be
equivalent
to
a
curse
.
<EOS>
And
that
spirit
brings
with
it
the
material
and
earthly
idea
that
all
events
that
favour
our
wishes
are
answers
to
our
prayer
;
and
so
they
are
in
one
sense
,
but
they
need
prayer
in
a
deeper
and
higher
spirit
to
keep
us
from
the
temptation
to
evil
which
such
events
invariably
bring
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
little
knew
how
Sylvia
's
time
had
been
passed
that
day
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
,
he
would
have
laid
down
this
night
with
even
a
heavier
heart
than
he
had
done
on
the
last
.
  
<EOS>
Charley
Kinraid
accompanied
his
cousins
as
far
as
the
spot
where
the
path
to
Haytersbank
Farm
diverged
.
<EOS>
Then
he
stopped
his
merry
talk
,
and
announced
his
intention
of
going
to
see
farmer
Robson
.
<EOS>
Bessy
Corney
looked
disappointed
and
a
little
sulky
;
but
her
sister
Molly
Brunton
laughed
,
and
said
,
    
"
Tell
truth
,
lad
!
<EOS>
Dannel
Robson
'd
niver
have
a
call
fra
'
thee
if
he
had
n't
a
pretty
daughter

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Indeed
,
but
he
would
,
"
replied
Charley
,
rather
annoyed
;
"
when
I
've
said
a
thing
,
I
do
it
.
<EOS>
I
promised
last
night
to
go
see
him
;
besides
,
I
like
the
old
man

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well

Toward

what

Haytersbank
was
closed
for
the
night
as
far
as
it
ever
was
closed
;
there
were
no
shutters
to
the
windows
,
nor
did
they
care
to
draw
the
inside
curtains
,
so
few
were
the
passers
-
by
.
<EOS>
The
house
door
was
fastened
;
but
the
shippen
door
a
little
on
in
the
same
long
low
block
of
building
stood
open
,
and
a
dim
light
made
an
oblong
upon
the
snowy
ground
outside
.
<EOS>
As
Kinraid
drew
near
he
heard
talking
there
,
and
a
woman
's
voice
;
he
threw
a
passing
glance
through
the
window
into
the
fire
-
lit
house
-
place
,
and
seeing
Mrs.
Robson
asleep
by
the
fireside
in
her
easy
-
chair
,
he
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
the
intermittent
sound
of
the
sharp
whistling
of
milk
into
the
pail
,
and
Kester
,
sitting
on
a
three
-
legged
stool
,
cajoling
a
capricious
cow
into
letting
her
fragrant
burden
flow
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
stood
near
the
farther
window
-
ledge
,
on
which
a
horn
lantern
was
placed
,
pretending
to
knit
at
a
gray
worsted
stocking
,
but
in
reality
laughing
at
Kester
's
futile
endeavours
,
and
finding
quite
enough
to
do
with
her
eyes
,
in
keeping
herself
untouched
by
the
whisking
tail
,
or
the
occasional
kick
.
<EOS>
The
frosty
air
was
mellowed
by
the
warm
and
odorous
breath
of
the
cattle
 
breath
that
hung
about
the
place
in
faint
misty
clouds
.
<EOS>
There
was
only
a
dim
light
;
such
as
it
was
,
it
was
not
dearly
defined
against
the
dark
heavy
shadow
in
which
the
old
black
rafters
and
manger
and
partitions
were
enveloped
.
  
<EOS>
As
Charley
came
to
the
door
,
Kester
was
saying
,
"
<EOS>
Quiet
wi
'
thee
,
wench
!
<EOS>
Theere
now
,
she
's
a

"
  
<EOS>
"
Why

Kester
,
"
laughed
Sylvia
,
"
<EOS>
thou'rt
asking
her
for
her
milk
wi
'
as
many
pretty
speeches
as
if
thou
wert
wooing

"
  
<EOS>
"
Hey
,
lass
!
<EOS>
"
said
Kester
,
turning
a
bit
towards
her
,
and
shutting
one
eye
to
cock
the
other
the
better
upon
her
;
an
operation
which
puckered
up
his
already
wrinkled
face
into
a
thousand
new
lines
and
folds
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
An
'
how
does
thee

"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
niver
a

so
impudent

"
said
Sylvia
,
reddening
and
tossing
her
head
a
little
;
"
I
'd
like
to
see
'em
try
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
!
"
said
Kester
,
wilfully
misunderstanding
her
meaning
,
"

wench
;
and

At
this
moment
Charley
stepped
in
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
gave
a
little
start
and
dropped
her
ball
of
worsted
.
<EOS>
Kester
made
as
though
absorbed
in
his
task
of
cajoling
Black
Nell
;
but
his
eyes
and
ears
were
both
vigilant
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
going
into
the
house
,
but
I
saw
yo'r
mother
asleep
,
and
I
did
n't
like
to
waken
her
,
so
I
just
came
on
here
.
<EOS>
Is
yo'r
father
to
the
fore
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
hanging
down
her
head
a
little
,
wondering
if
he
could
have
heard
the
way
in
which
she
and
Kester
had
been
talking
,
and
thinking
over
her
little
foolish
jokes
with
anger
against
herself
.
<EOS>
"
Father
is
gone
to
Winthrop
about
some
pigs
as
he
's
heerd
on
.
<EOS>
He
'll
not
be
back
till
seven
o'clock
or
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
but
half
-
past
five
,
and
Sylvia
in
the
irritation
of
the
moment
believed
that
she
wished
Kinraid
would
go
.
<EOS>
But
she
would
have
been
extremely
disappointed
if
he
had
.
<EOS>
Kinraid
himself
seemed
to
have
no
thought
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
He
saw
with
his
quick
eyes
,
not
unaccustomed
to
women
,
that
his
coming
so
unexpectedly
had
fluttered
Sylvia
,
and
anxious
to
make
her
quite
at
her
ease
with
him
,
and
not
unwilling
to
conciliate
Kester
,
he
addressed
his
next
speech
to
him
,
with
the
same
kind
of
air
of
interest
in
the
old
man
's
pursuit
that
a
young
man
of
a
different
class
sometimes
puts
on
when
talking
to
the
chaperone
of
a
pretty
girl
in
a
ball
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
handsome
beast
<EOS>
yo've
just
been
milking
,
master
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
;
but
handsome
is
as
handsome
does
.
<EOS>
It
were
only
yesterday
as
she
aimed
her
leg
right
at
t
'
pail
<EOS>
wi
'
t
'
afterings
in
.
<EOS>
She
knowed
it
were
afterings
as
well
as
any
Christian
,
and
t
'
more
t
'
mischief
t
'
<EOS>
better
she
likes
it
;
an
'
if
a
had
n't
been
too
quick
for
her
,
it
would
have
a
'
gone
swash
down
i
'
t
'
litter
.
<EOS>
This'n
's
a
far
better
cow
<EOS>
i
'
t
'
long
run
,
she
's
just
a
steady
goer
,
"
as
the
milky
down
-
pour
came
musical
and
even
from
the
stall
next
to
Black
Nell
's
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
was
knitting
away
vigorously
,
thinking
all
the
while
that
it
was
a
great
pity
she
had
not
put
on
a
better
gown
,
or
even
a
cap
with
brighter
ribbon
,
and
quite
unconscious
how
very
pretty
she
looked
standing
against
the
faint
light
<EOS>
,
her
head
<EOS>
a
little
bent
down
;
her
hair
catching
bright
golden
touches
,
as
it
fell
from
under
her
little
linen
cap
;
her
pink
bed
-
gown
,
confined
by
her
apron
-
string
,
giving
a
sort
of
easy
grace
to
her
figure
;
her
dark
full
linsey
petticoat
short
above
her
trim
ancles
,
looking
far
more
suitable
to
the
place
where
she
was
standing
than
her
long
gown
of
the
night
before
would
have
done
.
<EOS>
Kinraid
was
wanting
to
talk
to
her
,
and
to
make
her
talk
,
but
was
uncertain
how
to
begin
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
Kester
went
on
with
the
subject
last
spoken
about
.
  
<EOS>
"
Black
Nell
's
at
her
fourth
calf
now
,
so
she
ought
to
ha
'
left
off
her
tricks
and
turned
sober
-
like
.
<EOS>
But
bless
yo
'
,
there
's
some
cows
as
'll
be
skittish
till
they
're
fat
for
t
'
butcher
.
<EOS>
Not
but
what
a
like
milking
her
better
nor
a
steady
goer
;
a
man
has
allays
summat
to
be
watchin
'
for
;
and
a'm
kind
o
'
set
up
when
a've
mastered
her
at
last
.
<EOS>
T
'
young
missus
theere
<EOS>
,
she
's
mighty
fond
o
<EOS>
'
comin
'
t
'
see
Black
Nell
at
her
tantrums
.
<EOS>
She
'd
niver
come
near
me
if
a
'
cows
were
like
this'n
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
often
come
and
see
the
cows
milked
?
"
asked
Kinraid
,
  
"
<EOS>
Many
a
time
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
smiling
a
little
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
,
when
we
're
throng
,
I
help
Kester
;
but
now
we
've
only
Black
Nell
and
Daisy
giving
milk
.
<EOS>
Kester
knows
as
I
can
milk
Black
Nell
quite
easy
,
"
she
continued
,
half
vexed
that
Kester
had
not
named
this
accomplishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
<EOS>
when
she
's
in
a
good
frame
o
'
<EOS>
mind
,
as
she
is
sometimes
.
<EOS>
But
t
'
difficulty
is
to
milk
her
at
all
times
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
'd
come
a
bit
sooner
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
t
'
have
seen
you
milk
Black
Nell
,
"
addressing
Sylvia
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yo'd
better
come
to
-
morrow
e'en
,
and
see
what
a
hand
<EOS>
she
'll
mak
'
on
her
,
"
said
Kester
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
-
morrow
night
I
shall
be
far
on
my
road
back
to
Shields
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
-
morrow
!
"
said
Sylvia
,
suddenly
looking
up
at
him
,
and
then
dropping
her
eyes
,
as
she
found
he
had
been
watching
for
the
effect
of
his
intelligence
on
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mun
be
back
at
t
'
whaler
,
where
I
'm
engaged
,
"
continued
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
's
fitting
up
after
a
fresh
fashion
,
and
as
I
've
been
one
as
wanted
new
ways
,
I
mun
be
on
the
spot
for
t
'
look
after
her
.
<EOS>
Maybe
I
shall
take
a
run
down
here
afore
sailing
in
March
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
I
shall
try
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
good
deal
meant
and
understood
by
these
last
few
words
.
<EOS>
The
tone
in
which
they
were
spoken
gave
them
a
tender
intensity
not
lost
upon
either
of
the
hearers
.
<EOS>
Kester
cocked
his
eye
once
more
,
but
with
as
little
obtrusiveness
as
he
could
,
and
pondered
the
sailor
's
looks
and
ways
.
<EOS>
He
remembered
his
coming
about
the
place
the
winter
before
,
and
how
the
old
master
had
then
appeared
to
have
taken
to
him
;
but
at
that
time
Sylvia
had
seemed
to
Kester
too
little
removed
from
a
child
to
have
either
art
or
part
in
Kinraid
's
visits
;
now
,
however
,
the
case
was
different
.
<EOS>
Kester
in
his
sphere
 
among
his
circle
of
acquaintance
,
narrow
though
it
was
 
had
heard
with
much
pride
of
Sylvia
's
bearing
away
the
bell
at
church
and
at
market
,
wherever
girls
of
her
age
were
congregated
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
north
countryman
,
so
he
gave
out
no
further
sign
of
his
feelings
than
his
mistress
and
Sylvia
's
mother
had
done
on
a
like
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
"
T
'
lass
is
weel
enough
,
"
said
he
;
but
he
grinned
to
himself
,
and
looked
about
,
and
listened
to
the
hearsay
of
every
lad
,
wondering
who
was
handsome
,
and
brave
,
and
good
enough
to
be
Sylvia
's
mate
.
<EOS>
Now
,
of
late
,
it
had
seemed
to
the
canny
farm
-
servant
pretty
clear
that
Philip
Hepburn
was
"
after
her
"
;
and
to
Philip
,
Kester
had
an
instinctive
objection
,
a
kind
of
natural
antipathy
such
as
has
existed
in
all
ages
between
the
dwellers
in
a
town
and
those
in
the
country
,
between
agriculture
and
trade
.
<EOS>
So
,
while
Kinraid
and
Sylvia
kept
up
their
half
-
tender
,
half
-
jesting
conversation
,
Kester
was
making
up
his
slow
persistent
mind
as
to
the
desirability
of
the
young
man
then
present
as
a
husband
for
his
darling
,
as
much
from
his
being
other
than
Philip
in
every
respect
,
as
from
the
individual
good
qualities
he
possessed
.
<EOS>
Kester
's
first
opportunity
of
favouring
Kinraid
's
suit
consisted
in
being
as
long
as
possible
over
his
milking
;
so
never
were
cows
that
required
such
"
stripping
,
"
or
were
expected
to
yield
such
"
afterings
"
,
as
Black
Nell
and
Daisy
that
night
.
<EOS>
But
all
things
must
come
to
an
end
;
and
at
length
Kester
got
up
from
his
three
-
legged
stool
,
on
seeing
what
the
others
did
not
 
that
the
dip
-
candle
in
the
lantern
was
coming
to
an
end
 
and
that
in
two
or
three
minutes
more
the
shippen
would
be
in
darkness
,
and
so
his
pails
of
milk
be
endangered
.
<EOS>
In
an
instant
Sylvia
had
started
out
of
her
delicious
dreamland
,
her
drooping
eyes
were
raised
,
and
recovered
their
power
of
observation
;
her
ruddy
arms
were
freed
from
the
apron
in
which
she
had
enfolded
them
,
as
a
protection
from
the
gathering
cold
,
and
she
had
seized
and
adjusted
the
wooden
yoke
across
her
shoulders
,
ready
to
bear
the
brimming
milk
-
pails
to
the
dairy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
yo
'
at
her
!
"
exclaimed
Kester
to
Charley
,
as
he
adjusted
the
fragrant
pails
on
the
yoke
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
thinks
she
's
missus
a
ready
,
and
she
's
allays
for
carrying
in
t
'
milk
since
t
'
rhumatiz
cotched
my
shouther
<EOS>
i
'
t
'
back
end
;
and
when
she
says
"
Yea
,
"
it
's
as
much
as
my
heed
's
worth
to
say
"
Nay
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
along
the
wall
,
round
the
corner
,
down
the
round
slippery
stones
of
the
rambling
farmyard
,
behind
the
buildings
,
did
Sylvia
trip
,
safe
and
well
-
poised
,
though
the
ground
wore
all
one
coating
of
white
snow
,
and
in
many
places
was
so
slippery
as
to
oblige
Kinraid
to
linger
near
Kester
,
the
lantern
-
bearer
.
<EOS>
Kester
did
not
lose
his
opportunity
,
though
the
cold
misty
night
air
provoked
his
asthmatic
cough
when
-
ever
he
breathed
,
and
often
interrupted
his
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
a
good
wench
 
<EOS>
a
good
wench
as
iver
was
 
an
come
on
a
good
stock
<EOS>
,
an
'
that
's
summat
,
whether
in
a
cow
or
a
woman
.
<EOS>
A've
known
her
from
a
baby
;
she
's
a
reet
down
good
un
.
"
  
<EOS>
By
this
time
they
had
reached
the
back
-
kitchen
door
,
just
as
Sylvia
had
unladen
herself
,
and
was
striking
a
light
with
flint
and
tinder
.
<EOS>
The
house
seemed
warm
and
inviting
after
the
piercing
outer
air
,
although
the
kitchen
into
which
they
entered
contained
only
a
raked
and
slumbering
fire
at
one
end
,
over
which
,
on
a
crook
,
hung
the
immense
pan
of
potatoes
cooking
for
the
evening
meal
of
the
pigs
.
<EOS>
To
this
pan
Kester
immediately
addressed
himself
,
swinging
it
round
with
ease
,
owing
to
the
admirable
simplicity
of
the
old
-
fashioned
machinery
.
<EOS>
Kinraid
stood
between
Kester
and
the
door
into
the
dairy
,
through
which
Sylvia
had
vanished
with
the
milk
.
<EOS>
He
half
wished
to
conciliate
Kester
by
helping
him
,
but
he
seemed
also
attracted
,
by
a
force
which
annihilated
his
will
,
to
follow
her
wherever
she
went
.
<EOS>
Kester
read
his
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
alone
,
let
alone
,
"
said
he
;
"
pigs
'
vittle
takes
noan
such
dainty
carryin
'
as
milk
.
<EOS>
A
may
set
it
down
an
'
niver
spill
a
drop
;
she
's
noan
fit
for
t
'
serve
swine
,
nor
yo
<EOS>
'
other
,
mester
;
better
help
her
t
'
teem
t
'
milk
.
"
  
<EOS>
So
Kinraid
followed
the
light
 
his
light
 
into
the
icy
chill
of
the
dairy
,
where
the
bright
polished
tin
cans
were
quickly
dimmed
with
the
warm
,
sweet
-
smelling
milk
,
that
Sylvia
was
emptying
out
into
the
brown
pans
.
<EOS>
In
his
haste
to
help
her
,
Charley
took
up
one
of
the
pails
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
?
that'n
's
to
be
strained
.
<EOS>
Yo
'
have
a
'
the
cow
's
hair
in
.
<EOS>
Mother
's
very
particular
,
and
can
not
abide
a
hair
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
she
went
over
to
her
awkward
dairymaid
,
and
before
she
 
but
not
before
he
 
was
aware
of
the
sweet
proximity
,
she
was
adjusting
his
happy
awkward
arms
to
the
new
office
of
holding
a
milk
-
strainer
over
the
bowl
,
and
pouring
the
white
liquid
through
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
said
she
,
looking
up
for
a
moment
,
and
half
blushing
;
"
now
yo'll
know
how
to
do
it
next
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
next
time
was
to
come
now
,
"
said
Kinraid
;
but
she
had
returned
to
her
own
pail
,
and
seemed
not
to
hear
him
.
<EOS>
He
followed
her
to
her
side
of
the
dairy
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
but
a
short
memory
,
can
yo
'
not
show
me
again
how
t
'
hold
t
'
strainer
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
she
,
half
laughing
,
but
holding
her
strainer
fast
in
spite
of
his
insinuating
efforts
to
unlock
her
fingers
.
<EOS>
"
But
there
's
no
need
to
tell
me
yo've
getten
a
short
memory
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
<EOS>
what
have
I
done
?
<EOS>
how
dun
you
know
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Last
night
,
"
she
began
,
and
then
she
stopped
,
and
turned
away
her
head
,
pretending
to
be
busy
in
her
dairy
duties
of
rinsing
and
such
like
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
he
,
half
conjecturing
her
meaning
,
and
flattered
by
it
,
if
his
conjecture
were
right
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Last
night
 
what
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yo
'
know
!
<EOS>
"
said
she
,
as
if
impatient
at
being
both
literally
and
metaphorically
followed
about
,
and
driven
into
a
corner
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
tell
me
,
"
persisted
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
she
,
"
<EOS>
if
yo
'
will
have
it
,
I
think
yo
'
showed
yo'd
but
a
short
memory
when
yo
'
did
n't
know
me
again
,
and
yo
'
were
five
times
at
this
house
last
winter
,
and
that
's
not
so
long
sin
'
.
<EOS>
But
I
suppose
yo
'
see
a
vast
o
'
things
on
yo'r
voyages
by
land
or
by
sea
,
and
then
it
's
<EOS>
but
natural
yo
'
should
forget
.
"
<EOS>
She
wished
she
could
go
on
talking
,
but
could
not
think
of
anything
more
to
say
just
then
;
for
,
in
the
middle
of
her
sentence
,
the
flattering
interpretation
he
might
put
upon
her
words
,
on
her
knowing
so
exactly
the
number
of
times
he
had
been
to
Haytersbank
,
flashed
upon
her
,
and
she
wanted
to
lead
the
conversation
a
little
farther
afield
 
to
make
it
a
little
less
personal
.
<EOS>
This
was
not
his
wish
,
however
.
<EOS>
In
a
tone
which
thrilled
through
her
,
even
in
her
own
despite
,
he
said
,
    
"
Do
yo
'
think
that
can
ever
happen
again
,
Sylvia
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
quite
silent
;
almost
trembling
.
<EOS>
He
repeated
the
question
as
if
to
force
her
to
answer
.
<EOS>
Driven
to
bay
,
she
equivocated
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
happen
again
?
<EOS>
Let
me
go
,
I
dunno
what
yo're
talking
about
,
and
I
'm
a'most
numbed
wi
'
cold
.
"
  
<EOS>
For
the
frosty
air
came
sharp
in
through
the
open
lattice
window
,
and
the
ice
was
already
forming
on
the
milk
.
<EOS>
Kinraid
would
have
found
a
ready
way
of
keeping
his
cousins
,
or
indeed
most
young
women
,
warm
;
but
he
paused
before
he
dared
put
his
arm
round
Sylvia
;
she
had
something
so
shy
and
wild
in
her
look
and
manner
;
and
her
very
innocence
of
what
her
words
,
spoken
by
another
girl
,
might
lead
to
,
inspired
him
with
respect
,
and
kept
him
in
check
.
<EOS>
So
he
contented
himself
with
saying
,
    
"
I
'll
let
yo
'
go
into
t
'
warm
kitchen
if
yo'll
tell
me
<EOS>
if
yo
'
think
I
can
ever
forget
yo
'
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
up
at
him
defiantly
,
and
set
her
red
lips
firm
.
<EOS>
He
enjoyed
her
determination
not
to
reply
to
this
question
;
it
showed
she
felt
its
significance
.
<EOS>
Her
pure
eyes
looked
steadily
into
his
;
nor
was
the
expression
in
his
such
as
to
daunt
her
or
make
her
afraid
.
<EOS>
They
were
like
two
children
defying
each
other
;
each
determined
to
conquer
.
<EOS>
At
last
she
unclosed
her
lips
,
and
nodding
her
head
as
if
in
triumph
,
said
,
as
she
folded
her
arms
once
more
in
her
check
apron
,
    
"
Yo'll
have
to
go
home
sometime
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
for
a
couple
of
hours
yet
,
"
said
he
;
"
and
yo'll
be
frozen
first
;
so
yo'd
better
say
if
I
can
ever
forget
yo
'
again
,
without
more
ado
.
"
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
fresh
voices
breaking
on
the
silence
,
 
perhaps
the
tones
were
less
modulated
than
they
had
been
before
,
but
anyhow
Bell
Robson
's
voice
was
heard
calling
Sylvia
through
the
second
door
,
which
opened
from
the
dairy
to
the
house
-
place
,
in
which
her
mother
had
been
till
this
moment
asleep
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
darted
off
in
obedience
to
the
call
;
glad
to
leave
him
,
as
at
the
moment
Kinraid
resentfully
imagined
.
<EOS>
Through
the
open
door
he
heard
the
conversation
between
mother
and
daughter
,
almost
unconscious
of
its
meaning
,
so
difficult
did
he
find
it
to
wrench
his
thoughts
from
the
ideas
he
had
just
been
forming
with
Sylvia
's
bright
lovely
face
right
under
his
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sylvia
!
"
said
her
mother
,
"
who
's
yonder
?
<EOS>
"
Bell
was
sitting
up
in
the
attitude
of
one
startled
out
of
slumber
into
intensity
of
listening
;
her
hands
on
each
of
the
chair
-
arms
,
as
if
just
going
to
rise
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
fremd
man
i
'
t
'
house
.
<EOS>
I
heerd
his
voice
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
only
 
<EOS>
it
's
just
Charley
Kinraid
;
he
was
a
-
talking
to
me
<EOS>
i
'
t
'
dairy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'
t
'
dairy
,
lass
!
<EOS>
and
how
com'd
he
<EOS>
i
'
t
'
dairy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
com'd
to
see
feyther
.
<EOS>
Feyther
asked
him
last
night
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
conscious
that
he
could
overhear
every
word
that
was
said
,
and
a
little
suspecting
that
he
was
no
great
favourite
with
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thy
feyther
's
out
;
how
com'd
he
<EOS>
i
'
t
'
dairy
?
<EOS>
"
persevered
Bell
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
com'd
past
this
window
,
and
saw
yo
'
asleep
,
and
did
n't
like
for
t
'
waken
yo
'
;
so
he
com'd
on
to
t
'
shippen
,
and
when
I
carried
t
'
milk
in
   
'
  
<EOS>
But
now
Kinraid
came
in
,
feeling
the
awkwardness
of
his
situation
a
little
,
yet
with
an
expression
so
pleasant
and
manly
in
his
open
face
,
and
in
his
exculpatory
manner
,
that
Sylvia
lost
his
first
words
in
a
strange
kind
of
pride
of
possession
in
him
,
about
which
she
did
not
reason
nor
care
to
define
the
grounds
.
<EOS>
But
her
mother
rose
from
her
chair
somewhat
formally
,
as
if
she
did
not
intend
to
sit
down
again
while
he
stayed
,
yet
was
too
weak
to
be
kept
in
that
standing
attitude
long
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afeared
,
sir
,
Sylvie
has
n't
told
yo
'
that
my
master
's
out
,
and
not
like
to
be
in
till
late
.
<EOS>
He
'll
be
main
and
sorry
to
have
missed
yo
'
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
for
it
after
this
but
to
go
.
<EOS>
His
only
comfort
was
that
on
Sylvia
's
rosy
face
he
could
read
unmistakable
signs
of
regret
and
dismay
.
<EOS>
His
sailor
's
life
,
in
bringing
him
suddenly
face
to
face
with
unexpected
events
,
had
given
him
something
of
that
self
-
possession
which
we
consider
the
attribute
of
a
gentleman
;
and
with
an
apparent
calmness
which
almost
disappointed
Sylvia
,
who
construed
it
into
a
symptom
of
indifference
as
to
whether
he
went
or
stayed
,
he
bade
her
mother
good
-
night
,
and
only
said
,
in
holding
her
hand
a
minute
longer
than
was
absolutely
necessary
,
    
<EOS>
"
I
'm
coming
back
ere
<EOS>
I
sail
;
and
then
,
may
-
be
,
you
'll
answer
yon
question
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
spoke
low
,
and
her
mother
was
rearranging
herself
in
her
chair
,
else
Sylvia
would
have
had
to
repeat
the
previous
words
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
with
soft
thrilling
ideas
ringing
through
her
,
she
could
get
her
wheel
,
and
sit
down
to
her
spinning
by
the
fire
;
waiting
for
her
mother
to
speak
first
,
Sylvia
dreamt
her
dreams
.
  
<EOS>
Bell
Robson
was
partly
aware
of
the
state
of
things
,
as
far
as
it
lay
on
the
surface
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
aware
how
deep
down
certain
feelings
had
penetrated
into
the
girl
's
heart
who
sat
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
,
with
a
little
sad
air
diffused
over
her
face
and
figure
.
<EOS>
Bell
looked
upon
Sylvia
as
still
a
child
,
to
be
warned
off
forbidden
things
by
threats
of
danger
.
<EOS>
But
the
forbidden
thing
was
already
tasted
,
and
possible
danger
in
its
full
acquisition
only
served
to
make
it
more
precious
-
sweet
.
  
<EOS>
Bell
sat
upright
in
her
chair
,
gazing
into
the
fire
.
<EOS>
Her
milk
-
white
linen
mob
-
cap
fringed
round
and
softened
her
face
,
from
which
the
usual
apple
-
red
was
banished
by
illness
,
and
the
features
,
from
the
same
cause
,
rendered
more
prominent
and
stern
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
clean
buff
kerchief
round
her
neck
,
and
stuffed
into
the
bosom
of
her
Sunday
woollen
gown
of
dark
blue
,
 
if
she
had
been
in
working
-
trim
she
would
have
worn
a
bedgown
like
Sylvia
's
.
<EOS>
Her
sleeves
were
pinned
back
at
the
elbows
,
and
her
brown
arms
and
hard
-
working
hands
lay
crossed
in
unwonted
idleness
on
her
check
apron
.
<EOS>
Her
knitting
was
by
her
side
;
and
if
she
had
been
going
through
any
accustomed
calculation
or
consideration
she
would
have
had
it
busily
clinking
in
her
fingers
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
something
quite
beyond
common
to
think
about
,
and
,
perhaps
,
to
speak
about
;
and
for
the
minute
she
was
not
equal
to
knitting
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sylvie
,
"
she
began
at
length
,
<EOS>
"
did
I
e'er
tell
thee
on
Nancy
Hartley
as
I
knew
when
I
were
a
child
?
<EOS>
I
'm
thinking
a
deal
on
her
to
-
night
;
may
-
be
it
's
because
I
've
been
dreaming
on
yon
old
times
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
bonny
lass
as
ever
were
seen
,
I
've
heerd
folk
say
;
but
that
were
afore
<EOS>
I
knew
her
.
<EOS>
When
I
knew
her
she
were
crazy
,
poor
wench
;
wi
'
her
black
hair
a
-
streaming
down
her
back
,
and
her
eyes
,
as
were
a'most
as
black
,
allays
crying
out
for
pity
,
though
never
a
word
she
spoke
<EOS>
but
"
He
once
was
here
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Just
that
o'er
and
o'er
again
,
whether
she
were
cold
or
hot
,
full
or
hungry
,
"
He
once
was
here
,
"
were
all
her
speech
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
farm
-
servant
to
my
mother
's
brother
 
James
Hepburn
,
thy
great
-
uncle
as
was
;
she
were
a
poor
,
friendless
wench
,
a
parish
'
prentice
,
but
honest
and
gaum
-
like
,
till
a
lad
,
as
nobody
knowed
,
come
o'er
the
hills
<EOS>
one
sheep
-
shearing
fra
<EOS>
'
<EOS>
Whitehaven
;
he
had
summat
to
do
wi
'
'
th
sea
,
though
not
rightly
to
be
called
a
sailor
:
and
he
made
a
deal
on
Nancy
Hartley
,
just
to
beguile
the
time
like
;
and
he
went
away
and
ne'er
sent
a
thought
after
her
more
.
<EOS>
It
's
the
way
as
lads
have
;
and
there
's
no
holding
'em
when
they
're
fellows
as
nobody
knows
 
<EOS>
neither
where
they
come
fro
'
,
nor
what
they
've
been
doing
a
'
their
lives
,
<EOS>
till
they
come
athwart
some
poor
wench
like
Nancy
Hartley
.
<EOS>
She
were
but
a
softy
after
all
:
for
she
left
off
doing
her
work
in
a
proper
manner
.
<EOS>
I
've
heerd
my
aunt
say
as
she
found
out
as
summat
was
wrong
wi
'
Nancy
as
soon
as
th
'
milk
turned
bingy
,
for
there
ne'er
had
been
such
a
clean
lass
about
her
milk
-
cans
afore
that
;
and
from
bad
it
grew
to
worse
,
and
she
would
sit
and
do
nothing
but
play
wi
'
her
fingers
fro
'
morn
till
night
,
and
if
they
asked
her
what
ailed
her
,
she
just
said
,
"
He
once
was
here
;
"
<EOS>
and
if
they
bid
her
go
about
her
work
,
it
were
a
'
the
same
.
<EOS>
And
when
they
scolded
her
,
and
pretty
sharp
too
,
she
would
stand
up
and
put
her
hair
from
her
eyes
,
and
look
about
her
like
a
crazy
thing
searching
for
her
wits
,
and
ne'er
finding
them
,
for
all
she
could
think
on
was
just
,
"
He
once
was
here
.
<EOS>
"
It
were
a
caution
to
me
again
thinking
<EOS>
a
man
t
'
mean
what
he
says
when
he
's
a
-
talking
to
a
young
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
became
on
poor
Nancy
?
"
asked
Sylvia
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
should
become
on
her
or
on
any
lass
as
gives
hersel
'
up
to
thinking
on
a
man
who
cares
nought
for
her
?
"
replied
her
mother
,
a
little
severely
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
were
crazed
,
and
my
aunt
could
n't
keep
her
on
,
could
she
?
<EOS>
She
did
keep
her
a
long
weary
time
,
thinking
as
she
would
,
may
-
be
,
come
to
hersel
'
,
and
,
anyhow
,
she
were
a
motherless
wench
.
<EOS>
But
at
length
she
had
for
t
'
go
where
she
came
fro
'
 
back
to
Keswick
workhouse
:
and
when
last
I
heerd
on
her
she
were
chained
to
th
'
great
kitchen
dresser
<EOS>
i
'
t
'
workhouse
<EOS>
;
they
'd
beaten
her
till
she
were
taught
to
be
silent
and
quiet
<EOS>
i
'
th
'
daytime
,
but
at
night
,
when
she
were
left
alone
,
she
would
take
up
th
'
oud
cry
,
till
it
wrung
their
heart
,
so
they
'd
many
a
time
to
come
down
and
beat
her
again
to
get
any
peace
.
<EOS>
It
were
a
caution
to
me
,
as
I
said
afore
,
to
keep
fro
'
thinking
on
men
as
thought
nought
on
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
crazy
Nancy
!
"
sighed
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
The
mother
wondered
if
she
had
taken
the
"
caution
"
to
herself
,
or
was
only
full
of
pity
for
the
mad
girl
,
dead
long
before
.
    
<EOS>
THE
ENGAGEMENT
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
the
day
lengthens
so
the
cold
strengthens
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
so
that
year
;
the
hard
frost
which
began
on
new
year
's
eve
lasted
on
and
on
into
late
February
,
black
and
bitter
,
but
welcome
enough
to
the
farmers
,
as
it
kept
back
the
too
early
growth
of
autumn
-
sown
wheat
,
and
gave
them
the
opportunity
of
leading
manure
.
<EOS>
But
it
did
not
suit
invalids
as
well
,
and
Bell
Robson
,
though
not
getting
worse
,
did
not
make
any
progress
towards
amendment
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
was
kept
very
busy
,
notwithstanding
that
she
had
the
assistance
of
a
poor
widow
-
woman
in
the
neighbourhood
on
cleaning
,
or
washing
,
or
churning
days
.
<EOS>
Her
life
was
quiet
and
monotonous
,
although
hard
-
working
;
and
while
her
hands
mechanically
found
and
did
their
accustomed
labour
,
the
thoughts
that
rose
in
her
head
always
centred
on
Charley
Kinraid
,
his
ways
,
his
words
,
his
looks
,
whether
they
all
meant
what
she
would
fain
believe
they
did
,
and
whether
,
meaning
love
at
the
time
,
such
a
feeling
was
likely
to
endure
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
's
story
of
crazy
Nancy
had
taken
hold
of
her
;
but
not
as
a
"
caution
,
"
rather
as
a
parallel
case
to
her
own
.
<EOS>
Like
Nancy
,
and
borrowing
the
poor
girl
's
own
words
,
she
would
say
softly
to
herself
,
"
He
once
was
here
"
;
but
all
along
she
believed
in
her
heart
he
would
come
back
again
to
her
,
though
it
touched
her
strangely
to
imagine
the
agonies
of
forsaken
love
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
knew
little
of
all
this
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
busy
with
facts
and
figures
,
doggedly
fighting
through
the
necessary
business
,
and
only
now
and
then
allowing
himself
the
delicious
relaxation
of
going
to
Haytersbank
in
an
evening
,
to
inquire
after
his
aunt
's
health
,
and
to
see
Sylvia
;
for
the
two
Fosters
were
punctiliously
anxious
to
make
their
shopmen
test
all
their
statements
;
insisting
on
an
examination
of
the
stock
,
as
if
Hepburn
and
Coulson
were
strangers
to
the
shop
;
having
the
Monkshaven
auctioneer
in
to
appraise
the
fixtures
and
necessary
furniture
;
going
over
the
shop
books
for
the
last
twenty
years
with
their
successors
,
an
employment
which
took
up
evening
after
evening
;
and
not
unfrequently
taking
one
of
the
young
men
on
the
long
commercial
journeys
which
were
tediously
made
in
a
gig
.
<EOS>
By
degrees
both
Hepburn
and
Coulson
were
introduced
to
distant
manufacturers
and
wholesale
dealers
.
<EOS>
They
would
have
been
willing
to
take
the
Fosters
'
word
for
every
statement
the
brothers
had
made
on
new
year
's
day
;
but
this
,
it
was
evident
,
would
not
have
satisfied
their
masters
,
who
were
scrupulous
in
insisting
that
whatever
advantage
there
was
should
always
fall
on
the
side
of
the
younger
men
.
  
<EOS>
When
Philip
saw
Sylvia
she
was
always
quiet
and
gentle
;
perhaps
more
silent
than
she
had
been
a
year
ago
,
and
she
did
not
attend
so
briskly
to
what
was
passing
around
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
rather
thinner
and
paler
;
but
whatever
change
there
was
in
her
was
always
an
improvement
in
Philip
's
eyes
,
so
long
as
she
spoke
graciously
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
thought
she
was
suffering
from
long
-
continued
anxiety
about
her
mother
,
or
that
she
had
too
much
to
do
;
and
either
cause
was
enough
to
make
him
treat
her
with
a
grave
regard
and
deference
which
had
a
repressed
tenderness
in
it
,
of
which
she
,
otherwise
occupied
,
was
quite
unaware
.
<EOS>
She
liked
him
better
,
too
,
than
she
had
done
a
year
or
two
before
,
because
he
did
not
show
her
any
of
the
eager
attention
which
teased
her
then
,
although
its
meaning
was
not
fully
understood
.
  
<EOS>
Things
were
much
in
this
state
when
the
frost
broke
,
and
milder
weather
succeeded
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
time
so
long
looked
forward
to
by
the
invalid
and
her
friends
,
as
favouring
the
doctor
's
recommendation
of
change
of
air
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
was
to
take
her
to
spend
a
fortnight
with
a
kindly
neighbour
,
who
lived
near
the
farm
they
had
occupied
,
forty
miles
or
so
inland
,
before
they
came
to
Haytersbank
.
<EOS>
The
widow
-
woman
was
to
come
and
stay
in
the
house
,
to
keep
Sylvia
company
,
during
her
mother
's
absence
.
<EOS>
Daniel
,
indeed
,
was
to
return
home
after
conveying
his
wife
to
her
destination
;
but
there
was
so
much
to
be
done
on
the
land
at
this
time
of
the
year
,
that
Sylvia
would
have
been
alone
all
day
<EOS>
had
it
not
been
for
the
arrangement
just
mentioned
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
active
stirring
in
Monkshaven
harbour
as
well
as
on
shore
.
<EOS>
The
whalers
were
finishing
their
fittings
-
out
for
the
Greenland
seas
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
"
close
"
season
,
that
is
to
say
,
there
would
be
difficulty
in
passing
the
barrier
of
ice
which
lay
between
the
ships
and
the
whaling
-
grounds
;
and
yet
these
must
be
reached
before
June
,
or
the
year
's
expedition
would
be
of
little
avail
.
<EOS>
Every
blacksmith
's
shop
rung
with
the
rhythmical
clang
of
busy
hammers
,
beating
out
old
iron
,
such
as
horseshoes
,
nails
or
stubs
,
into
the
great
harpoons
;
the
quays
were
thronged
with
busy
and
important
sailors
,
rushing
hither
and
thither
,
conscious
of
the
demand
in
which
they
were
held
at
this
season
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
It
was
war
time
,
too
.
<EOS>
Many
captains
unable
to
procure
men
in
Monkshaven
would
have
to
complete
their
crews
in
the
Shetlands
.
<EOS>
The
shops
in
the
town
were
equally
busy
;
stores
had
to
be
purchased
by
the
whaling
-
masters
,
warm
clothing
of
all
sorts
to
be
provided
.
<EOS>
These
were
the
larger
wholesale
orders
;
but
many
a
man
,
and
woman
,
too
,
brought
out
their
small
hoards
to
purchase
extra
comforts
,
or
precious
keepsakes
for
some
beloved
one
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
time
of
the
great
half
-
yearly
traffic
of
the
place
;
another
impetus
was
given
to
business
when
the
whalers
returned
in
the
autumn
,
and
the
men
were
flush
of
money
,
and
full
of
delight
at
once
more
seeing
their
homes
and
their
friends
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
much
to
be
done
in
Fosters
'
shop
,
and
later
hours
were
kept
than
usual
.
<EOS>
Some
perplexity
or
other
was
occupying
John
and
Jeremiah
Foster
;
their
minds
were
not
so
much
on
the
alert
as
usual
,
being
engaged
on
some
weighty
matter
of
which
they
had
as
yet
spoken
to
no
one
.
<EOS>
But
it
thus
happened
that
they
did
not
give
the
prompt
assistance
they
were
accustomed
to
render
at
such
times
;
and
Coulson
had
been
away
on
some
of
the
new
expeditions
devolving
on
him
and
Philip
as
future
partners
.
<EOS>
One
evening
after
the
shop
was
closed
,
while
they
were
examining
the
goods
,
and
comparing
the
sales
with
the
entries
in
the
day
-
book
,
Coulson
suddenly
inquired
    
"
<EOS>
By
the
way
,
Hester
,
does
thee
know
where
the
parcel
of
best
bandanas
is
gone
?
<EOS>
There
was
four
left
,
as
I
'm
pretty
sure
,
when
I
set
off
to
Sandsend
;
and
to
-
day
Mark
Alderson
came
in
,
and
would
fain
have
had
one
,
and
I
could
find
none
nowhere
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
sold
t
'
last
to
-
day
,
to
yon
sailor
,
the
specksioneer
,
who
fought
the
press
-
gang
same
time
as
poor
Darley
were
killed
.
<EOS>
He
took
it
,
and
three
yards
of
yon
pink
ribbon
wi
'
t
'
black
and
yellow
crosses
on
it
,
as
Philip
could
never
abide
.
<EOS>
Philip
has
got
'em
<EOS>
i
'
t
'
book
,
if
he
'll
only
look
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
he
here
again
?
"
said
Philip
;
"
I
did
n't
see
him
.
<EOS>
What
brings
him
here
,
where
he
's
noan
wanted
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
T
'
shop
were
throng
wi
'
folk
,
"
said
Hester
,
"
and
he
knew
his
own
mind
about
the
handkercher
,
and
did
n't
tarry
long
.
<EOS>
Just
as
he
was
leaving
,
his
eye
caught
on
t
'
ribbon
,
and
he
came
back
for
it
.
<EOS>
It
were
when
yo
'
were
serving
Mary
Darby
and
there
was
a
vast
o
'
folk
about
yo
'
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
'd
seen
him
,
"
said
Coulson
.
<EOS>
"
I
'd
ha
'
gi'en
him
a
word
and
a
look
he
'd
not
ha
'
forgotten
in
a
hurry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
's
up
?
"
said
Philip
,
surprised
at
William
's
unusual
manner
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
rather
gratified
to
find
a
reflection
of
his
own
feelings
about
Kinraid
.
<EOS>
Coulson
's
face
was
pale
with
anger
,
but
for
a
moment
or
two
he
seemed
uncertain
whether
he
would
reply
or
not
.
  
<EOS>
"
Up
!
"
said
he
at
length
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
just
this
:
he
came
after
my
sister
for
better
nor
two
year
;
and
a
better
lass
 
no
,
nor
a
prettier
<EOS>
i
'
<EOS>
my
eyes
 
niver
broke
bread
.
<EOS>
And
then
my
master
saw
another
girl
,
that
he
liked
better
"
 
William
almost
choked
in
his
endeavour
to
keep
down
all
appearance
of
violent
anger
,
and
then
went
on
,
"
and
that
he
played
t
'
same
game
wi
'
,
as
I
've
heerd
tell
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
did
thy
sister
take
it
?
"
asked
Philip
,
eagerly
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
died
in
a
six
-
month
,
"
said
William
;
<EOS>
"
_
she
_
forgived
him
,
but
it
's
beyond
me
.
<EOS>
I
thought
it
were
him
when
I
heerd
of
t
'
work
about
Darley
;
Kinraid
 
and
coming
fra
'
Newcassel
,
where
Annie
lived
'
prentice
 
<EOS>
and
I
made
inquiry
,
and
it
were
t
'
same
man
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
say
no
more
about
him
,
for
it
stirs
t
'
old
Adam
more
nor
I
like
,
or
is
fitting
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Out
of
respect
to
him
,
Philip
asked
no
more
questions
although
there
were
many
things
that
he
fain
would
have
known
.
<EOS>
Both
Coulson
and
he
went
silently
and
grimly
through
the
remainder
of
their
day
's
work
.
<EOS>
Independent
of
any
personal
interest
which
either
or
both
of
them
had
or
might
have
in
Kinraid
's
being
a
light
o
'
love
,
this
fault
of
his
was
one
with
which
the
two
grave
,
sedate
young
men
had
no
sympathy
.
<EOS>
Their
hearts
were
true
and
constant
,
whatever
else
might
be
their
failings
;
and
it
is
no
new
thing
to
"
damn
the
faults
we
have
no
mind
to
.
"
<EOS>
Philip
wished
that
it
was
not
so
late
,
or
that
very
evening
he
would
have
gone
to
keep
guard
over
Sylvia
in
her
mother
's
absence
 
<EOS>
nay
,
perhaps
he
might
have
seen
reason
to
give
her
a
warning
of
some
kind
.
<EOS>
But
,
if
he
had
done
so
,
it
would
have
been
locking
the
stable
-
door
after
the
steed
was
stolen
.
<EOS>
Kinraid
had
turned
his
steps
towards
Haytersbank
Farm
as
soon
as
ever
he
had
completed
his
purchases
.
<EOS>
He
had
only
come
that
afternoon
to
Monkshaven
,
and
for
the
sole
purpose
of
seeing
Sylvia
once
more
before
he
went
to
fulfil
his
engagement
as
specksioneer
in
the
_
Urania
_
,
a
whaling
-
vessel
that
was
to
sail
from
North
Shields
on
Thursday
morning
,
and
this
was
Monday
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
sat
in
the
house
-
place
,
her
back
to
the
long
low
window
,
in
order
to
have
all
the
light
the
afternoon
hour
afforded
for
her
work
.
<EOS>
A
basket
of
her
father
's
unmended
stockings
was
on
the
little
round
table
beside
her
,
and
one
was
on
her
left
hand
,
which
she
supposed
herself
to
be
mending
;
but
from
time
to
time
she
made
long
pauses
,
and
looked
in
the
fire
;
and
yet
there
was
but
<EOS>
little
motion
of
flame
or
light
in
it
out
of
which
to
conjure
visions
.
<EOS>
It
was
"
redd
up
"
for
the
afternoon
;
covered
with
a
black
mass
of
coal
,
over
which
the
equally
black
kettle
hung
on
the
crook
.
<EOS>
In
the
back
-
kitchen
Dolly
Reid
,
Sylvia
's
assistant
during
her
mother
's
absence
,
chanted
a
lugubrious
ditty
,
befitting
her
condition
as
a
widow
,
while
she
cleaned
tins
,
and
cans
,
and
milking
-
pails
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
these
bustling
sounds
prevented
Sylvia
from
hearing
approaching
footsteps
coming
down
the
brow
with
swift
advance
;
at
any
rate
,
she
started
and
suddenly
stood
up
as
some
one
entered
the
open
door
.
<EOS>
It
was
strange
<EOS>
she
should
be
so
much
startled
,
for
the
person
who
entered
had
been
in
her
thoughts
all
during
those
long
pauses
.
<EOS>
Charley
Kinraid
and
the
story
of
crazy
Nancy
had
been
the
subjects
for
her
dreams
for
many
a
day
,
and
many
a
night
.
<EOS>
Now
he
stood
there
,
bright
and
handsome
as
ever
,
with
just
that
much
timidity
in
his
face
,
that
anxiety
as
to
his
welcome
,
which
gave
his
accost
an
added
charm
,
<EOS>
could
she
but
have
perceived
it
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
so
afraid
of
herself
,
so
unwilling
to
show
what
she
felt
,
and
how
much
she
had
been
thinking
of
him
in
his
absence
,
that
her
reception
seemed
cold
and
still
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
come
forward
to
meet
him
;
she
went
crimson
to
the
very
roots
of
her
hair
;
but
that
,
in
the
waning
light
,
he
could
not
see
;
and
she
shook
so
that
she
felt
as
if
she
could
hardly
stand
;
but
the
tremor
was
not
visible
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
wondered
if
he
remembered
the
kiss
that
had
passed
between
them
on
new
year
's
eve
 
the
words
that
had
been
spoken
in
the
dairy
on
new
year
's
day
;
the
tones
,
the
looks
,
that
had
accompanied
those
words
.
<EOS>
But
all
she
said
was
    
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
think
to
see
yo
'
.
<EOS>
I
thought
yo'd
ha
'
sailed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
told
yo
'
I
should
come
back
,
did
n't
I
?
"
<EOS>
said
he
,
still
standing
,
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
,
waiting
to
be
asked
to
sit
down
;
and
she
,
in
her
bashfulness
,
forgetting
to
give
the
invitation
,
but
,
instead
,
pretending
to
be
attentively
mending
the
stocking
she
held
.
<EOS>
Neither
could
keep
quiet
and
silent
long
.
<EOS>
She
felt
his
eyes
were
upon
her
,
watching
every
motion
,
and
grew
more
and
more
confused
in
her
expression
and
behaviour
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
little
taken
aback
by
the
nature
of
his
reception
,
and
was
not
sure
at
first
whether
to
take
the
great
change
in
her
manner
,
from
what
it
had
been
when
last
he
saw
her
,
as
a
favourable
symptom
or
otherwise
.
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
,
luckily
for
him
,
in
some
turn
of
her
arm
to
reach
the
scissors
on
the
table
,
she
caught
the
edge
of
her
work
-
basket
,
and
down
it
fell
.
<EOS>
She
stooped
to
pick
up
the
scattered
stockings
and
ball
of
worsted
,
and
so
did
he
;
and
when
they
rose
up
,
he
had
fast
hold
of
her
hand
,
and
her
face
was
turned
away
,
half
ready
to
cry
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
ails
yo
'
at
me
?
<EOS>
"
said
he
,
beseechingly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yo
'
might
ha
'
forgotten
me
;
<EOS>
and
yet
I
thought
we
made
a
bargain
against
forgetting
each
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
answer
.
<EOS>
He
went
on
:
"
Yo've
never
been
out
<EOS>
o
'
my
thoughts
,
Sylvia
Robson
;
<EOS>
and
I
'm
come
back
to
Monkshaven
for
nought
but
<EOS>
to
see
you
once
and
again
afore
<EOS>
I
go
away
to
the
northern
seas
.
<EOS>
It
's
not
two
hour
sin
'
<EOS>
I
landed
at
Monkshaven
,
and
I
've
been
near
neither
kith
nor
kin
as
yet
;
and
now
I
'm
here
<EOS>
you
wo
n't
speak
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
to
say
,
"
said
she
,
in
a
low
,
almost
inaudible
tone
.
<EOS>
Then
hardening
herself
,
and
resolving
to
speak
as
if
she
did
not
understand
his
only
half
-
expressed
meaning
,
she
lifted
up
her
head
,
and
all
but
looking
at
him
 
while
she
wrenched
her
hand
out
of
his
 
<EOS>
she
said
:
"
Mother
's
gone
to
Middleham
for
a
visit
,
and
feyther
's
out
<EOS>
i
'
t
'
plough
-
field
<EOS>
wi
'
Kester
;
but
he
'll
be
in
afore
long
.
"
  
<EOS>
Charley
did
not
speak
for
a
minute
or
so
.
<EOS>
Then
he
said
    
"
Yo're
not
so
dull
as
to
think
I
'm
come
all
this
way
for
t
'
see
either
your
father
or
your
mother
.
<EOS>
I
've
a
great
respect
for
'em
both
;
but
I
'd
hardly
ha
'
come
all
this
way
for
to
see
'em
,
and
me
bound
to
be
back
<EOS>
i
'
<EOS>
Shields
,
if
I
walk
every
step
of
the
way
,
by
Wednesday
night
.
<EOS>
It
's
that
yo
'
wo
n't
understand
my
meaning
,
Sylvia
<EOS>
;
it
's
not
that
yo
'
do
n't
,
or
that
yo
'
ca
n't
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
made
no
effort
to
repossess
himself
of
her
hand
.
<EOS>
She
was
quite
silent
,
but
in
spite
of
herself
she
drew
long
hard
breaths
.
<EOS>
"
I
may
go
back
to
where
I
came
from
,
"
he
went
on
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
to
go
to
sea
wi
'
a
blessed
hope
to
cheer
me
up
,
and
a
knowledge
o
'
some
one
as
loved
me
as
I
'd
left
behind
;
some
one
as
loved
me
half
as
much
as
I
did
her
;
for
th
'
measure
o
'
my
love
toward
her
is
so
great
and
mighty
<EOS>
,
I
'd
be
content
wi
'
half
as
much
from
her
,
till
I
'd
taught
her
to
love
me
more
.
<EOS>
But
if
she
's
a
cold
heart
and
can
not
care
for
a
honest
sailor
,
why
,
then
,
I
'd
best
go
back
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
made
for
the
door
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
been
pretty
sure
from
some
sign
or
other
,
or
he
would
never
have
left
it
to
her
womanly
pride
to
give
way
,
and
for
her
to
make
the
next
advance
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
taken
two
steps
when
she
turned
quickly
towards
him
,
and
said
something
 
<EOS>
the
echo
of
which
,
rather
than
the
words
themselves
,
reached
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
know
yo
'
cared
for
me
;
yo
'
niver
said
so
.
<EOS>
"
In
an
instant
he
was
back
at
her
side
,
his
arm
round
her
in
spite
of
her
short
struggle
,
and
his
eager
passionate
voice
saying
,
"
Yo
'
never
knowed
I
loved
you
,
Sylvia
?
<EOS>
say
it
again
,
and
look
i
'
<EOS>
my
face
<EOS>
while
yo
'
say
it
,
if
yo
'
can
.
<EOS>
Why
,
last
winter
I
thought
yo'd
be
such
a
woman
when
yo'd
come
to
be
one
as
my
een
had
never
looked
upon
,
and
this
year
,
ever
sin
<EOS>
'
I
saw
yo
'
<EOS>
i
'
the
kitchen
corner
sitting
crouching
behind
my
uncle
,
I
<EOS>
as
good
as
swore
<EOS>
I
'd
have
yo
'
for
wife
,
or
never
we
d
at
all
.
<EOS>
And
it
was
not
long
ere
yo
'
knowed
it
,
for
all
yo
'
were
so
coy
,
and
now
yo
'
have
the
face
 
<EOS>
no
,
yo
'
have
not
the
face
 
come
,
<EOS>
my
darling
,
what
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
for
she
was
crying
;
and
on
his
turning
her
wet
blushing
face
towards
him
the
better
to
look
at
it
,
she
suddenly
hid
it
in
his
breast
.
<EOS>
He
lulled
and
soothed
her
in
his
arms
,
as
if
she
had
been
a
weeping
child
and
he
her
mother
;
and
then
they
sat
down
on
the
settle
together
,
and
when
she
was
more
composed
they
began
to
talk
.
<EOS>
He
asked
her
about
her
mother
;
not
sorry
in
his
heart
at
Bell
Robson
's
absence
.
<EOS>
He
had
intended
if
necessary
to
acknowledge
his
wishes
and
desires
with
regard
to
Sylvia
to
her
parents
;
but
for
various
reasons
he
was
not
sorry
that
circumstances
had
given
him
the
chance
of
seeing
her
alone
,
and
obtaining
her
promise
to
marry
him
without
being
obliged
to
tell
either
her
father
or
her
mother
at
present
.
<EOS>
"
I
ha
'
spent
my
money
pretty
free
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
I
've
ne'er
<EOS>
a
penny
to
the
fore
,
and
<EOS>
yo'r
parents
may
look
for
something
better
for
yo
'
,
my
pretty
:
<EOS>
but
when
I
come
back
fro
'
this
voyage
I
shall
stand
a
chance
of
having
a
share
<EOS>
i
'
th
'
_
Urania
_
,
and
may
-
be
<EOS>
I
shall
be
mate
as
well
as
specksioneer
;
and
I
can
get
a
matter
of
from
seventy
to
ninety
pound
a
voyage
,
let
alone
<EOS>
th
'
half
-
guineas
for
every
whale
I
strike
,
and
six
shilling
a
gallon
on
th
'
oil
;
and
if
I
keep
steady
wi
'
Forbes
and
Company
,
they
'll
make
me
master
<EOS>
i
'
time
,
for
I
've
had
good
schooling
,
and
can
work
a
ship
as
well
as
any
man
;
an
'
I
leave
yo
'
wi
'
yo'r
parents
,
or
take
a
cottage
for
yo
'
nigh
at
hand
;
but
I
would
like
to
have
something
to
the
fore
,
and
that
I
shall
have
,
please
God
,
when
we
come
back
<EOS>
i
'
th
'
autumn
.
<EOS>
I
shall
go
to
sea
<EOS>
happy
<EOS>
,
now
,
thinking
I
've
yo'r
word
.
<EOS>
Yo're
not
one
to
go
back
from
it
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sure
,
else
it
's
a
long
time
to
leave
such
a
pretty
girl
as
yo
'
,
and
ne'er
<EOS>
a
chance
of
a
letter
reaching
yo
'
just
to
tell
yo
'
once
again
how
I
love
yo
'
,
and
to
bid
yo
'
not
forget
yo'r
true
love
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
'll
be
no
need
o
'
that
,
"
murmured
Sylvia
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
too
dizzy
with
happiness
to
have
attended
much
to
his
details
of
his
worldly
prospects
,
but
at
the
sound
of
his
tender
words
of
love
her
eager
heart
was
ready
to
listen
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
he
,
wanting
to
draw
her
out
into
more
confession
of
her
feelings
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
many
a
one
ready
to
come
after
yo
'
;
and
yo'r
mother
is
not
o'er
captivated
wi
'
me
;
and
there
's
yon
tall
fellow
of
a
cousin
as
looks
black
at
me
,
for
if
I
'm
not
mista'en
<EOS>
he
's
a
notion
of
being
sweet
on
yo
'
hisself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
he
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
with
some
contempt
in
her
tone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
so
full
<EOS>
o
'
business
and
t
'
shop
,
and
o
'
makin
'
money
,
and
gettin
'
wealth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
;
but
perhaps
when
he
gets
a
rich
man
he
'll
come
and
ask
my
Sylvia
to
be
his
wife
,
and
what
will
she
say
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
'll
niver
come
asking
such
a
foolish
question
,
"
said
she
,
a
little
impatiently
;
"
he
knows
what
answer
he
'd
get
if
he
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Kinraid
said
,
almost
as
if
to
himself
,
"
Yo'r
mother
favours
him
though
.
"
<EOS>
But
she
,
weary
of
a
subject
she
cared
nothing
about
,
and
eager
to
identify
herself
with
all
his
interests
,
asked
him
about
his
plans
almost
at
the
same
time
that
he
said
these
last
words
;
and
they
went
on
as
lovers
do
,
intermixing
a
great
many
tender
expressions
with
a
very
little
conversation
relating
to
facts
.
  
<EOS>
Dolly
Reid
came
in
,
and
went
out
softly
,
unheeded
by
them
.
<EOS>
But
Sylvia
's
listening
ears
caught
her
father
's
voice
,
as
he
and
Kester
returned
homewards
from
their
day
's
work
in
the
plough
-
field
;
and
she
started
away
,
and
fled
upstairs
in
shy
affright
,
leaving
Charley
to
explain
his
presence
in
the
solitary
kitchen
to
her
father
.
  
<EOS>
He
came
in
,
not
seeing
that
any
one
was
there
at
first
;
for
they
had
never
thought
of
lighting
a
candle
.
<EOS>
Kinraid
stepped
forward
into
the
firelight
;
his
purpose
of
concealing
what
he
had
said
to
Sylvia
quite
melted
away
by
the
cordial
welcome
her
father
gave
him
the
instant
that
he
recognized
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bless
thee
,
lad
!
<EOS>
who
'd
ha
'
thought
o
'
seein
'
thee
?
<EOS>
Why
,
if
iver
a
thought
on
thee
at
all
,
it
were
half
way
to
Davis
'
Straits
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
t
'
winter
's
been
a
dree
season
,
and
thou'rt
,
may
-
be
<EOS>
,
i
'
t
'
reet
on
'
t
to
mak
'
<EOS>
a
late
start
.
<EOS>
Latest
start
as
iver
I
made
was
ninth
o
'
March
,
an
'
<EOS>
we
struck
thirteen
whales
that
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
something
to
say
to
you
,
"
said
Charley
,
in
a
hesitating
voice
,
so
different
to
his
usual
hearty
way
,
that
Daniel
gave
him
a
keen
look
of
attention
before
he
began
to
speak
.
<EOS>
And
,
perhaps
,
the
elder
man
was
not
unprepared
for
the
communication
that
followed
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
it
was
not
unwelcome
.
<EOS>
He
liked
Kinraid
,
and
had
strong
sympathy
not
merely
with
what
he
knew
of
the
young
sailor
's
character
,
but
with
the
life
he
led
,
and
the
business
he
followed
.
<EOS>
Robson
listened
to
all
he
said
with
approving
nods
and
winks
,
till
Charley
had
told
him
everything
he
had
to
say
;
and
then
he
turned
and
struck
his
broad
horny
palm
into
Kinraid
's
as
if
concluding
a
bargain
,
while
he
expressed
in
words
his
hearty
consent
to
their
engagement
.
<EOS>
He
wound
up
with
a
chuckle
,
as
the
thought
struck
him
that
this
great
piece
of
business
,
of
disposing
of
their
only
child
,
had
been
concluded
while
his
wife
was
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A'm
noan
<EOS>
so
sure
as
t
'
missus
'll
like
it
<EOS>
,
"
said
he
;
"
tho
'
whativer
<EOS>
she
'll
ha
'
to
say
again
it
<EOS>
,
mischief
only
knows
.
<EOS>
But
she
's
noan
keen
on
matterimony
;
though
a
have
made
her
as
good
a
man
as
there
is
in
a
'
t
'
Ridings
.
<EOS>
Anyhow
,
a'm
master
,
and
that
she
knows
.
<EOS>
But
may
-
be
,
for
t
'
sake
o
'
<EOS>
peace
an
'
quietness
 
tho
<EOS>
'
she
's
niver
a
scolding
tongue
,
that
a
will
say
for
her
 
we'n
best
keep
this
matter
to
ourselves
till
thou
comes
int
'
port
again
.
<EOS>
T
'
lass
upstairs
'll
like
nought
better
than
t
'
curl
hersel
'
round
a
secret
,
and
purr
<EOS>
o'er
it
,
<EOS>
just
as
t
'
oud
cat
does
o'er
<EOS>
her
blind
kitten
.
<EOS>
But
thou'll
be
wanting
to
see

,
a'll
be
bound
.
<EOS>
An
oud
man
like
me
is
n't
as
good
company
as
a
pretty
lass
.
<EOS>
"
Laughing
a
low
rich
laugh
over
his
own
wit
,
Daniel
went
to
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
,
and
called
,
"
Sylvie
,
Sylvie
!
<EOS>
come
down
,
lass
!
<EOS>
a
's
reet
;
come
down
!
"
  
<EOS>
For
a
time
there
was
no
answer
.
<EOS>
Then
a
door
was
unbolted
,
and
Sylvia
said
,
  
"
I
ca
n't
come
down
again
.
<EOS>
I
'm
noan
comin
'
down
again
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Daniel
laughed
the
more
at
this
,
especially
when
he
caught
Charley
's
look
of
disappointment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hearken
how
she
's
bolted
her
door
.
<EOS>
She
'll
noane
come
near
us
this
night
.
<EOS>
Eh
!
<EOS>
but
she
's
a
stiff
little
'
un
;
she
's
been
our
only
one
,
and
we'n
mostly
let
her
have
her
own
way
.
<EOS>
But
we
'll
have
a
pipe
and
a
glass
;
and
that
,
to
my
thinking
,
is
as
good
company
as
iver
a
woman
in
Yorkshire
.

REJECTED
WARNINGS
  
<EOS>
The
post
arrived
at
Monkshaven
three
times
in
the
week
;
sometimes
,
indeed
,
there
were
not
a
dozen
letters
in
the
bag
,
which
was
brought
thither
by
a
man
in
a
light
mail
-
cart
,
who
took
the
better
part
of
a
day
to
drive
from
York
;
dropping
private
bags
here
and
there
on
the
moors
,
at
some
squire
's
lodge
or
roadside
inn
.
<EOS>
Of
the
number
of
letters
that
arrived
in
Monkshaven
,
the
Fosters
,
shopkeepers
and
bankers
,
had
the
largest
share
.
  
<EOS>
The
morning
succeeding
the
day
on
which
Sylvia
had
engaged
herself
to
Kinraid
,
the
Fosters
seemed
unusually
anxious
to
obtain
their
letters
.
<EOS>
Several
times
Jeremiah
came
out
of
the
parlour
in
which
his
brother
John
was
sitting
in
expectant
silence
,
and
,
passing
through
the
shop
,
looked
up
and
down
the
market
-
place
in
search
of
the
old
lame
woman
,
who
was
charitably
employed
to
deliver
letters
,
and
who
must
have
been
lamer
than
ever
this
morning
,
to
judge
from
the
lateness
of
her
coming
.
<EOS>
Although
none
but
the
Fosters
knew
the
cause
of
their
impatience
for
their
letters
,
yet
there
was
such
tacit
sympathy
between
them
and
those
whom
they
employed
,
that
Hepburn
,
Coulson
,
and
Hester
were
all
much
relieved
when
the
old
woman
at
length
appeared
with
her
basket
of
letters
.
  
<EOS>
One
of
these
seemed
of
especial
consequence
to
the
good
brothers
.
<EOS>
They
each
separately
looked
at
the
direction
,
and
then
at
one
another
;
and
without
a
word
they
returned
with
it
unread
into
the
parlour
,
shutting
the
door
,
and
drawing
the
green
silk
curtain
close
,
the
better
to
read
it
in
privacy
.
  
<EOS>
Both
Coulson
and
Philip
felt
that
something
unusual
was
going
on
,
and
were
,
perhaps
,
as
full
of
consideration
as
to
the
possible
contents
of
this
London
letter
,
as
of
attention
to
their
more
immediate
business
.
<EOS>
But
fortunately
there
was
little
doing
in
the
shop
.
<EOS>
Philip
,
indeed
,
was
quite
idle
when
John
Foster
opened
the
parlour
-
door
,
and
,
half
doubtfully
,
called
him
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
As
the
door
of
communication
shut
the
three
in
,
Coulson
felt
himself
a
little
aggrieved
.
<EOS>
A
minute
ago
Philip
<EOS>
and
he
were
on
a
level
of
ignorance
,
from
which
the
former
was
evidently
going
to
be
raised
.
<EOS>
But
he
soon
returned
to
his
usual
state
of
acquiescence
in
things
as
they
were
,
which
was
partly
constitutional
,
and
partly
the
result
of
his
Quaker
training
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
apparently
by
John
Foster
's
wish
that
Philip
had
been
summoned
.
<EOS>
Jeremiah
,
the
less
energetic
and
decided
brother
,
was
still
discussing
the
propriety
of
the
step
when
Philip
entered
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
need
for
haste
,
John
;
better
not
call
the
young
man
till
we
have
further
considered
the
matter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
the
young
man
was
there
in
presence
;
and
John
's
will
carried
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
It
seemed
from
his
account
to
Philip
(
explanatory
of
what
he
,
in
advance
of
his
brother
's
slower
judgment
,
thought
to
be
a
necessary
step
)
,
that
the
Fosters
had
for
some
time
received
anonymous
letters
,
warning
them
,
with
distinct
meaning
,
though
in
ambiguous
terms
,
against
a
certain
silk
-
manufacturer
in
Spitalfields
,
with
whom
they
had
had
straightforward
business
dealings
for
many
years
;
but
to
whom
they
had
latterly
advanced
money
.
<EOS>
The
letters
hinted
at
the
utter
insolvency
of
this
manufacturer
.
<EOS>
They
had
urged
their
correspondent
to
give
them
his
name
in
confidence
,
and
this
morning
's
letter
had
brought
it
;
but
the
name
was
totally
unknown
to
them
,
though
there
seemed
no
reason
to
doubt
the
reality
of
either
it
or
the
address
,
the
latter
of
which
was
given
in
full
.
<EOS>
Certain
circumstances
were
mentioned
regarding
the
transactions
between
the
Fosters
and
this
manufacturer
,
which
could
be
known
only
to
those
who
were
in
the
confidence
of
one
or
the
other
;
and
to
the
Fosters
the
man
was
,
as
has
been
said
,
a
perfect
stranger
.
<EOS>
Probably
,
they
would
have
been
unwilling
to
incur
the
risk
they
had
done
on
this
manufacturer
Dickinson
's
account
,
if
it
had
not
been
that
he
belonged
to
the
same
denomination
as
themselves
,
and
was
publicly
distinguished
for
his
excellent
and
philanthropic
character
;
but
these
letters
were
provocative
of
anxiety
,
especially
since
this
morning
's
post
had
brought
out
the
writer
's
full
name
,
and
various
particulars
showing
his
intimate
knowledge
of
Dickinson
's
affairs
.
  
<EOS>
After
much
perplexed
consultation
,
John
had
hit
upon
the
plan
of
sending
Hepburn
to
London
to
make
secret
inquiries
respecting
the
true
character
and
commercial
position
of
the
man
whose
creditors
,
not
a
month
ago
,
they
had
esteemed
it
an
honour
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
Even
now
Jeremiah
was
ashamed
of
their
want
of
confidence
in
one
so
good
;
he
believed
that
the
information
they
had
received
would
all
prove
a
mistake
,
founded
on
erroneous
grounds
,
if
not
a
pure
invention
of
an
enemy
;
and
he
had
only
been
brought
partially
to
consent
to
the
sending
of
Hepburn
,
by
his
brother
's
pledging
himself
that
the
real
nature
of
Philip
's
errand
should
be
unknown
to
any
human
creature
,
save
them
three
.
  
<EOS>
As
all
this
was
being
revealed
to
Philip
,
he
sat
apparently
unmoved
and
simply
attentive
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
he
was
giving
all
his
mind
to
understanding
the
probabilities
of
the
case
,
leaving
his
own
feelings
in
the
background
till
his
intellect
should
have
done
its
work
.
<EOS>
He
said
little
;
but
what
he
did
say
was
to
the
point
,
and
satisfied
both
brothers
.
<EOS>
John
perceived
that
his
messenger
would
exercise
penetration
and
act
with
energy
;
while
Jeremiah
was
soothed
by
Philip
's
caution
in
not
hastily
admitting
the
probability
of
any
charge
against
Dickinson
,
and
in
giving
full
weight
to
his
previous
good
conduct
and
good
character
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
had
the
satisfaction
of
feeling
himself
employed
on
a
mission
which
would
call
out
his
powers
,
and
yet
not
exceed
them
.
<EOS>
In
his
own
mind
he
forestalled
the
instructions
of
his
masters
,
and
was
silently
in
advance
of
John
Foster
's
plans
and
arrangements
,
while
he
appeared
to
listen
to
all
that
was
said
with
quiet
business
-
like
attention
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
settled
that
the
next
morning
he
was
to
make
his
way
northwards
to
Hartlepool
<EOS>
,
whence
he
could
easily
proceed
either
by
land
or
sea
to
Newcastle
,
from
which
place
smacks
were
constantly
sailing
to
London
.
<EOS>
As
to
his
personal
conduct
and
behaviour
there
,
the
brothers
overwhelmed
him
with
directions
and
advice
;
nor
did
they
fail
to
draw
out
of
the
strong
box
in
the
thick
wall
of
their
counting
-
house
a
more
than
sufficient
sum
of
money
for
all
possible
expenses
.
<EOS>
Philip
had
never
had
so
much
in
his
hands
before
,
and
hesitated
to
take
it
,
saying
it
was
more
than
he
should
require
;
but
they
repeated
,
with
fresh
urgency
,
their
warnings
about
the
terrible
high
prices
of
London
,
till
he
could
only
resolve
to
keep
a
strict
account
,
and
bring
back
all
that
he
did
not
expend
,
since
nothing
but
his
taking
the
whole
sum
would
satisfy
his
employers
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
was
once
more
behind
the
counter
,
he
had
leisure
enough
for
consideration
as
far
as
Coulson
could
give
it
him
.
<EOS>
The
latter
was
silent
,
brooding
over
the
confidence
which
Philip
had
apparently
received
,
but
which
was
withheld
from
him
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
yet
know
of
the
culminating
point
 
of
Philip
's
proposed
journey
to
London
;
that
great
city
of
London
,
which
,
from
its
very
inaccessibility
fifty
years
ago
,
loomed
so
magnificent
through
the
mist
of
men
's
imaginations
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
to
be
denied
that
Philip
felt
exultant
at
the
mere
fact
of
"
going
to
London
.
"
<EOS>
But
then
again
,
the
thought
of
leaving
Sylvia
;
of
going
out
of
possible
daily
reach
of
her
;
of
not
seeing
her
for
a
week
 
a
fortnight
;
nay
,
he
might
be
away
for
a
month
,
 
for
no
rash
hurry
<EOS>
was
to
mar
his
delicate
negotiation
,
 
<EOS>
gnawed
at
his
heart
,
and
spoilt
any
enjoyment
he
might
have
anticipated
from
gratified
curiosity
,
or
even
from
the
consciousness
of
being
trusted
by
those
whose
trust
and
regard
he
valued
.
<EOS>
The
sense
of
what
he
was
leaving
grew
upon
him
the
longer
he
thought
on
the
subject
;
he
almost
wished
that
he
had
told
his
masters
earlier
in
the
conversation
of
his
unwillingness
to
leave
Monkshaven
for
so
long
a
time
;
and
then
again
he
felt
that
the
gratitude
he
owed
them
quite
prohibited
his
declining
any
task
they
might
impose
,
especially
as
they
had
more
than
once
said
that
it
would
not
do
for
them
to
appear
in
the
affair
,
and
yet
that
to
no
one
else
could
they
entrust
so
difficult
and
delicate
a
matter
.
<EOS>
Several
times
that
day
,
as
he
perceived
Coulson
's
jealous
sullenness
,
he
thought
in
his
heart
that
the
consequence
of
the
excessive
confidence
for
which
Coulson
envied
him
was
a
burden
from
which
he
would
be
thankful
to
be
relieved
.
  
<EOS>
As
they
all
sat
at
tea
in
Alice
Rose
's
house
-
place
,
Philip
announced
his
intended
journey
;
a
piece
of
intelligence
he
had
not
communicated
earlier
to
Coulson
because
he
had
rather
dreaded
the
increase
of
dissatisfaction
<EOS>
it
was
sure
to
produce
,
and
of
which
he
knew
the
expression
would
be
restrained
by
the
presence
of
Alice
Rose
and
her
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
Lunnon
!
"
exclaimed
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
Hester
said
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
some
folks
has
the
luck
!
"
said
Coulson
.
  
<EOS>
"
Luck
!
<EOS>
"
said
Alice
,
turning
sharp
round
on
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Niver
let
me
hear
such
a
vain
word
out
o
'
thy
mouth
,
laddie
,
again
.
<EOS>
It
's
the
Lord
's
doing
,
and
luck
's
the
devil
's
way
o
'
putting
it
.
<EOS>
Maybe
it
's
to
try
Philip
he
's
sent
there
;
happen
it
may
be
a
fiery
furnace
to
him
;
for
I
've
heerd
tell
it
's
full
o
'
temptations
,
and
he
may
fall
into
sin
 
<EOS>
and
then
where
'd
be
the
"
luck
"
on
it
?
<EOS>
But
why
art
ta
going
?
<EOS>
and
the
morning
,
say'st
thou
?
<EOS>
Why
,
thy
best
shirt
is
in
t
'
suds
,
and
no
time
for
t
'
starch
and
iron
it
.
<EOS>
Whatten
the
great
haste
as
should
take
thee
to
Lunnon
wi'out
<EOS>
thy
ruffled
shirt
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
none
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
my
doing
,
"
said
Philip
;
"
there
's
business
to
be
done
,
and
John
Foster
says
I
'm
to
do
it
;
and
I
'm
to
start
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
not
turn
thee
out
wi'out
<EOS>
thy
<EOS>
ruffled
shirt
,
if
I
sit
up
a
'
neet
,
"
said
Alice
,
resolutely
.
  
<EOS>
"
Niver
fret
thyself
,
mother
,
about
t
'
shirt
,
"
said
Philip
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
need
a

,
London
's
not
what
I
take
it
for
if
I

made
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hearken
to
him
!
"
said
Alice
.
"
<EOS>
He
speaks
as
if
buying
o
'
ready
-
made
shirts
were
nought
to
him
,
and
he
wi
'
a
good
half
-
dozen
as
I
made
mysel
'
.
<EOS>
Eh
,
lad
?
<EOS>
but
if
that
's
the
frame
o
'
mind
<EOS>
thou'rt
in
,
Lunnon
is
like
for
to
be
a
sore
place
o
'
temptation
.
<EOS>
There
's
pitfalls
for
men
,
and
traps
for
money
at
ivery
turn
,
as
I
've
heerd
say
.
<EOS>
It
would
ha
'
been
better
if
John
Foster
had
sent
an
older
man
on
his
business
,
whativer
it
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
seem
to
make
a
deal
o
<EOS>
'
Philip
all
on
a
sudden
,
"
said
Coulson
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
sent
for
,
and
talked
to
i
'
privacy
,
while
Hester
and
me
is
left
i
'
t
'
shop
for
t
'
bear
t
'
brunt
o
'
t

serving

<EOS>
"
  
"
Philip
knows
,
"
said
Hester
,
and
then
,
somehow
,
her
voice
failed
her
<EOS>
and
she
stopped
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
paid
no
attention
to
this
half
-
uttered
sentence
;
he
was
eager
to
tell
Coulson
,
as
far
as
he
could
do
so
without
betraying
his
master
's
secret
,
how
many
drawbacks
there
were
to
his
proposed
journey
,
in
the
responsibility
which
it
involved
,
and
his
unwillingness
to
leave
Monkshaven
:
he
said
    
"
Coulson
,
I
'd
give
a
deal
it
were
thou
that
were
going
,
and
not
me
.
<EOS>
At
least
,
there
is
many
a
time
I
'd
give
a
deal
.
<EOS>
I
'll
not
deny
but
at
other
times
I
'm
pleased
at
the
thought
<EOS>
on't
.
<EOS>
But
,
if
I
could
I
'd
change
places
wi
'
thee
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
fine
talking
,
"
said
Coulson
,
half
mollified
,
and
yet
not
caring
to
show
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
make
no
doubt
it
were
an
even
chance
betwixt
us
two
at
first
,
which
on
us
was
to
go
;
but
somehow
thou
got
the
start
and
thou'st
stuck
to
it
till
it
's
too
late
for
aught
<EOS>
but
to
say
thou
's
sorry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
William
,
"
said
Philip
,
rising
,
"
it
's
an
ill
look
-
out
for
the
future
,
if
thee
and
me
is
to
quarrel
,
like
two
silly
wenches
,
o'er
each
bit
of
pleasure
,
or
what
thou
fancies
to
be
pleasure
,
as
falls
in
t
'
way
of
either
on
us
.
<EOS>
I
've
said
truth
to
thee
,
and
played
thee
fair
,
and
I
've
got
to
go
to
Haytersbank
for
to
wish
'em
good
-
by
,
so
I
'll
not
stay
longer
here
to
be
misdoubted
by
thee
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
took
his
cap
and
was
gone
,
not
heeding
Alice
's
shrill
inquiry
as
to
his
clothes
and
his
ruffled
shirt
.
<EOS>
Coulson
sat
still
,
penitent
and
ashamed
;
at
length
he
stole
a
look
at
Hester
.
<EOS>
She
was
playing
with
her
teaspoon
,
but
he
could
see
that
she
was
choking
down
her
tears
;
he
could
not
choose
but
force
her
to
speak
with
an
ill
-
timed
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
to
do
,
Hester
?
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
She
lifted
up
those
eyes
,
usually
so
soft
and
serene
;
now
they
were
full
of
the
light
of
indignation
shining
through
tears
.

"
To

"
<EOS>
she
said
;
"
Coulson
,
I
'd
thought
better
of
thee
,
going
and
doubting
and
envying
Philip
,
as
niver
did
thee
an
ill
turn
,
or
said
an
ill
word
,
or
thought
an
ill
thought
by
thee
;
and
sending
him
away
out
o
'
t
'
house
this
last
night
of
all
,
may
-
be
,
wi
'
thy
envyings
and
jealousy
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
hastily
got
up
and
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
Alice
was
away
,
looking
up
Philip
's
things
for
his
journey
.
<EOS>
Coulson
remained
alone
,
feeling
like
a
guilty
child
,
but
dismayed
by
Hester
's
words
,
even
more
than
by
his
own
regret
at
what
he
had
said
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
walked
rapidly
up
the
hill
-
road
towards
Haytersbank
.
<EOS>
He
was
chafed
and
excited
by
Coulson
's
words
,
and
the
events
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
He
had
meant
to
shape
his
life
,
and
now
it
was
,
as
it
were
,
being
shaped
for
him
,
and
yet
he
was
reproached
for
the
course
it
was
taking
,
as
much
as
though
he
were
an
active
agent
;
accused
of
taking
advantage
over
Coulson
,
<EOS>
his
intimate
companion
for
years
;
he
who
esteemed
himself
above
taking
an
unfair
advantage
over
any
man
!
<EOS>
His
feeling
on
the
subject
was
akin
to
that
of
Hazael
,
"
Is
thy
servant
a
dog
that
he
should
do
this
thing
?
"
  
<EOS>
His
feelings
,
disturbed
on
this
one
point
,
shook
his
judgment
off
its
balance
on
another
.
<EOS>
The
resolution
he
had
deliberately
formed
of
not
speaking
to
Sylvia
on
the
subject
of
his
love
till
he
could
announce
to
her
parents
the
fact
of
his
succession
to
Fosters
'
business
,
and
till
he
had
patiently
,
with
long
-
continuing
and
deep
affection
,
worked
his
way
into
her
regard
,
was
set
aside
during
the
present
walk
.
<EOS>
He
would
speak
to
her
of
his
passionate
attachment
,
before
he
left
,
for
an
uncertain
length
of
time
,
and
the
certain
distance
of
London
.
<EOS>
And
all
the
modification
on
this
point
which
his
judgment
could
obtain
from
his
impetuous
and
excited
heart
was
,
that
he
would
watch
her
words
and
manner
well
when
he
announced
his
approaching
absence
,
and
if
in
them
he
read
the
slightest
token
of
tender
regretful
feeling
,
he
would
pour
out
his
love
at
her
feet
,
not
even
urging
the
young
girl
to
make
any
return
,
or
to
express
the
feelings
of
which
he
hoped
the
germ
was
already
budding
in
her
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
patient
with
her
;
he
could
not
be
patient
himself
.
<EOS>
His
heart
beating
,
<EOS>
his
busy
mind
rehearsing
the
probable
coming
scene
<EOS>
,
he
turned
into
the
field
-
path
that
led
to
Haytersbank
.
<EOS>
Coming
along
it
,
and
so
meeting
him
,
advanced
Daniel
Robson
,
in
earnest
talk
with
Charley
Kinraid
.
<EOS>
Kinraid
,
then
,
had
been
at
the
farm
:
<EOS>
Kinraid
had
been
seeing
Sylvia
,
her
mother
away
.
<EOS>
The
thought
of
poor
dead
Annie
Coulson
flashed
into
Philip
's
mind
.
<EOS>
Could
he
be
playing
the
same
game
with
Sylvia
?
<EOS>
Philip
set
his
teeth
and
tightened
his
lips
at
the
thought
of
it
.
<EOS>
They
had
stopped
talking
;
they
had
seen
him
already
,
or
his
impulse
would
have
been
to
dodge
behind
the
wall
and
avoid
them
;
even
though
one
of
his
purposes
in
going
to
Haytersbank
had
been
to
bid
his
uncle
farewell
.
  
<EOS>
Kinraid
took
him
by
surprise
from
the
hearty
greeting
he
gave
him
,
and
which
Philip
would
fain
have
avoided
.
<EOS>
But
the
specksioneer
was
full
of
kindliness
towards
all
the
world
,
especially
towards
all
Sylvia
's
friends
,
and
,
convinced
of
her
great
love
towards
himself
,
had
forgotten
any
previous
jealousy
of
Philip
.
<EOS>
Secure
and
exultant
,
his
broad
,
handsome
,
weather
-
bronzed
face
was
as
great
a
contrast
to
Philip
's
long
,
thoughtful
,
sallow
countenance
,
as
his
frank
manner
was
to
the
other
's
cold
reserve
.
<EOS>
It
was
some
minutes
before
Hepburn
could
bring
himself
to
tell
the
great
event
that
was
about
to
befall
him
before
this
third
person
whom
he
considered
as
an
intrusive
stranger
.
<EOS>
But
as
Kinraid
seemed
to
have
no
idea
of
going
on
,
and
as
there
really
was
no
reason
why
he
and
all
the
world
should
not
know
of
Philip
's
intentions
,
he
told
his
uncle
that
he
was
bound
for
London
the
next
day
on
business
connected
with
the
Fosters
.
  
<EOS>
Daniel
was
deeply
struck
with
the
fact
that
he
was
talking
to
a
man
setting
off
for
London
at
a
day
's
notice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thou'll
niver
tell
me
this
has
n't
been
brewin
'
longer
nor
twelve
hours
;
thou
's
a
sly
close
chap
,
and
we
hannot
seen
thee
<EOS>
this
se'nnight
<EOS>
;
thou'll
ha
'
been
thinkin
'
on
this
,
and
cogitating
it
,
may
-
be
,
a
'
that
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
said
Philip
,
"
I
knew
nought
about
it
last
night
;
it
's
none
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
my
doing
,
going
,
for
I
'd
liefer
ha
'
stayed
where
I
am
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yo'll
like
it
when
once
yo're
there
,
"
said
Kinraid
,
with
a
travelled
air
of
superiority
,
as
Philip
fancied
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
sha
n't
,
"
he
replied
,
shortly
.
<EOS>
"
Liking
has
nought
to
do
with
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
'
yo
'
knew
nought
about
it
<EOS>
last
neet
<EOS>
,
"
continued
Daniel
,
musingly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
life
's
soon
o'er
;
else
when
I
were
a
young
fellow
,
folks
made
their
wills
<EOS>
afore
goin'
to
Lunnon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yet
I
'll
be
bound
to
say
yo
'
niver
made
a
will
before
going
to
sea
,
"
said
Philip
,
half
smiling
.
  
<EOS>
"
Na
,
na
;
but
that
's
quite
another
mak
'
o
'
thing
;
going
'
to
sea
comes
natteral
to
a
man
,
but
goin'
to
Lunnon
,
 
<EOS>
I
were
once
there
,
and
were
near
deafened
wi
'
t
'
throng
and
t
'
sound
.
<EOS>
I
were
but
two
hours
<EOS>
i
'
t
'
place
,
though
our
ship
lay
a
fortneet
off
Gravesend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Kinraid
now
seemed
in
a
hurry
;
but
Philip
was
stung
with
curiosity
to
ascertain
his
movements
,
and
suddenly
addressed
him
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
heard
yo
'
were
i
'
these
parts
.
<EOS>
Are
you
for
staying
here
long
?
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
certain
abruptness
in
Philip
's
tone
,
if
not
in
his
words
,
which
made
Kinraid
look
in
his
face
with
surprise
,
and
answer
with
equal
curtness
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
off
<EOS>
i
'
th
'
morning
;
and
sail
for
the
north
seas
day
after
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
turned
away
,
and
began
to
whistle
,
as
if
he
did
not
wish
for
any
further
conversation
with
his
interrogator
.
<EOS>
Philip
,
indeed
,
had
nothing
more
to
say
to
him
:
he
had
learned
all
he
wanted
to
know
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'd
like
to
bid
good
-
by
to
Sylvie
.
<EOS>
Is
she
at
home
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
of
her
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
A'm
thinking
thou'll
not
find
her
.
<EOS>
She
'll
be
off
to
Yesterbarrow
t
'
see
if
she
'd
get
a
settin
'
<EOS>
o
'
their
eggs
;
her
grey
speckled
hen
is
cluckin
'
,
and
nought
'll
serve
our
Sylvia
but
their
eggs
to
set
her
upon
.
<EOS>
But
,
for
a
'
that
,
she
may
n't
be
gone
yet
.
<EOS>
Best
go
on
and
see
for
thysel
'
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
they
parted
;
but
Philip
had
not
gone
many
steps
before
his
uncle
called
him
back
,
Kinraid
slowly
loitering
on
meanwhile
.
<EOS>
Robson
was
fumbling
among
some
dirty
papers
he
had
in
an
old
leather
case
,
which
he
had
produced
out
of
his
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
"
Fact
is
,
Philip
,
t
'
pleugh
's
in
a
bad

gearin
'
and
a

an

and
if
thou
's

'
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
going
by
York
;
I
'm
going
by
a
Newcastle
smack
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Newcassel
 
Newcassel
 
it
's
pretty
much
t
'
same

<EOS>
Here
,
lad
,
thou
can
read

easy
;
it
's
a

cut
out
on

and

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
,
"
said
Philip
:
'
"
<EOS>
Robinson
,
Side
,
Newcastle
,
can
give
all
requisite
information
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ay
,
ay

"
said
Robson
;
"
thou
's
hit
t
'
marrow
on
t
'
matter
.
<EOS>
Now
,
if
thou'rt
i
'
Newcassel
,
thou
can
learn
all
about
it
;
thou'rt
little
better
nor
a

bein

mainly

but
they
'll
tell

;
and
write
down
what
they
sayn
,
and
what
's

,
and
look
sharp
as
to
what

<EOS>
Thou'll
be
<EOS>
i
'
Newcassel
to

<EOS>
Well
,
then
,
I
'll
reckon
to
hear
fro
'
thee
in
a
week
,
or
,
mayhap
,
less

for

backward
,
and
I
'd
like

<EOS>
I
'd
a
month
's
mind
to
write
to
Brunton
,
as
married
Molly
Corney
,
but
writin
'
is
more
<EOS>
i
'
thy
way
an

mine
;
and
if
thou
sells
ribbons
,
Brunton
sells
cheese
,
and
that
's
no
better
.
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
promised
to
do
his
best
,
and
to
write
word
to
Robson
,
who
,
satisfied
with
his
willingness
to
undertake
the
commission
,
bade
him
go
on
and
see
if
he
could
not
find
the
lass
.
<EOS>
Her
father
was
right
in
saying
that
she
might
not
have
set
out
for
Yesterbarrow
.
<EOS>
She
had
talked
about
it
to
Kinraid
and
her
father
in
order
to
cover
her
regret
at
her
lover
's
accompanying
her
father
to
see
some
new
kind
of
harpoon
about
which
the
latter
had
spoken
.
<EOS>
But
as
soon
as
they
had
left
the
house
,
and
she
had
covertly
watched
them
up
the
brow
in
the
field
,
she
sate
down
to
meditate
and
dream
about
her
great
happiness
in
being
beloved
by
her
hero
,
Charley
Kinraid
.
<EOS>
No
gloomy
dread
of
his
long
summer
's
absence
;
no
fear
of
the
cold
,
glittering
icebergs
bearing
mercilessly
down
on
the
_
Urania
_
,
nor
shuddering
anticipation
of
the
dark
waves
of
evil
import
,
crossed
her
mind
.
<EOS>
He
loved
her
,
and
that
was
enough
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
looked
,
trance
-
like
,
into
a
dim
,
glorious
future
of
life
;
her
lips
,
still
warm
and
reddened
by
his
kiss
,
were
just
parted
in
a
happy
smile
,
when
she
was
startled
by
the
sound
of
an
approaching
footstep
 
a
footstep
quite
familiar
enough
for
her
to
recognize
it
,
and
which
was
unwelcome
now
,
as
disturbing
her
in
the
one
blessed
subject
of
thought
in
which
alone
she
cared
to
indulge
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Philip
!
<EOS>
an
'
what
brings
_
yo
'
_
here
?
"
was
her
rather
ungracious
greeting
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Sylvie
,
are
yo
'
sorry
to
see
me
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Philip
,
reproachfully
.
<EOS>
But
she
turned
it
off
with
assumed
lightness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
been
wanting
yo
'
this
week
past
wi
'
t
'
match
to
my
blue
ribbon
yo
'
said
yo'd
get
and
bring
me
next
time
yo
'
came
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
forgotten
it
,
Sylvie
.
<EOS>
It
's
clean
gone
out
of
my
mind
,
"
said
Philip
,
with
true
regret
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
've
had
a
deal
to
think
on
,
"
he
continued
,
penitently
,
as
if
anxious
to
be
forgiven
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
did
not
want
his
penitence
,
did
not
care
for
her
ribbon
,
was
troubled
by
his
earnestness
of
manner
 
<EOS>
but
he
knew
nothing
of
all
that
;
he
only
knew
that
she
whom
he
loved
had
asked
him
to
do
something
for
her
,
and
he
had
neglected
it
;
so
,
anxious
to
be
excused
and
forgiven
<EOS>
,
he
went
on
with
the
apology
she
cared
not
to
hear
.
  
<EOS>
If
she
had
been
less
occupied
with
her
own
affairs
,
less
engrossed
with
deep
feeling
,
she
would
have
reproached
him
,
if
only
in
jest
,
for
his
carelessness
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
she
scarcely
took
in
the
sense
of
his
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
Sylvie
,
I
've
had
a
deal
to
think
on
;
before
long
I
intend
telling
yo
'
all
about
it
;
just
now
I
'm
not
free
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
And
when
a
man
's
mind
is
full
o
'
business
,
most
particular
when
it
's
other
folk
's
as
is
trusted
to
him
,
he
seems
to
lose
count
on
the
very
things
he
'd
most
care
for
at
another
time
.
"
<EOS>
He
paused
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
's
galloping
thoughts
were
pulled
suddenly
up
by
his
silence
;
she
felt
that
he
wanted
her
to
say
something
,
but
she
could
think
of
nothing
besides
an
ambiguous
    
"
Well
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
'm
off
to
London
<EOS>
i
'
t
'
morning
,
"
added
he
,
a
little
wistfully
,
almost
as
if
beseeching
her
to
show
or
express
some
sorrow
at
a
journey
,
the
very
destination
of
which
showed
that
he
would
be
absent
for
some
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
Lunnon
!
"
said
she
,
with
some
surprise
.
"
<EOS>
Yo're
niver
thinking
o
'
going
to
live
theere
,
for
sure
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Surprise
,
and
curiosity
,
and
wonder
;
nothing
more
,
as
Philip
's
instinct
told
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
reasoned
that
first
correct
impression
away
with
ingenious
sophistry
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
to
live
there
:
only
to
stay
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
back
,
I
reckon
,
in
a
month
or
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
that
's
nought
of
a
going
away
,
"
said
she
,
rather
petulantly
.
<EOS>
"
Them
as
goes
to
t
'
Greenland
seas
has
to
bide
away
for
six
months
and
more
,
"
and
she
sighed
.
  
<EOS>
Suddenly
a
light
shone
down
into
Philip
's
mind
.
<EOS>
His
voice
was
changed
as
he
spoke
next
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
met
that
good
-
for
-
nothing
chap
,
Kinraid
,
wi
'
yo'r
father
just
now
.
<EOS>
He
'll
ha
'
been
here
,
Sylvie
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
stooped
for
something
she
had
dropped
,
and
came
up
red
as
a
rose
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
;
what
then
?
"
<EOS>
And
she
eyed
him
defiantly
,
though
in
her
heart
she
trembled
,
she
knew
not
why
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
then
?
and
yo'r
mother
away
.
<EOS>
He
's
no
company
for
such
as
thee
,
at
no
time
,
Sylvie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Feyther
and
me
chooses
our
own
company
,
without
iver
asking
leave
o
'
yo
'
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
hastily
arranging
the
things
in
the
little
wooden
work
-
box
that
was
on
the
table
,
preparatory
to
putting
it
away
.
<EOS>
At
the
time
,
in
his
agitation
,
he
saw
,
but
did
not
affix
any
meaning
to
it
,
that
the
half
of
some
silver
coin
was
among
the
contents
thus
turned
over
before
the
box
was
locked
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
thy
mother
would
n't
like
it
,
Sylvie
;
he
's
played
false
wi
'
other
lasses
,
he
'll
be
playing
thee
false
<EOS>
some
o
'
<EOS>
these
days
,
if
thou
lets
him
come
about
thee
.
<EOS>
He
went
on
wi
'
Annie
Coulson
,
William
's
sister
,
till
he
broke
her
heart
;
and
sin
<EOS>
then
he
's
been
on
wi
'
others
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dunnot
believe
a
word
on
'
t
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
standing
up
,
all
aflame
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
niver
telled
a
lie
<EOS>
i
'
my
life
,
"
said
Philip
,
almost
choking
with
grief
at
her
manner
to
him
,
and
the
regard
for
his
rival
which
she
betrayed
.
<EOS>
"
It
were
Willie
Coulson
as
telled
me
,
as
solemn
and
serious
as
one
man
can
speak
to
another
;
and
he
said
it
were
n't
the
first
nor
the
last
time
as
he
had
made
his
own
game
with
young
women
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
dare
yo
'
come
here
to
me
wi
'
yo'r
backbiting
tales
?
"
said
Sylvia
,
shivering
all
over
with
passion
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
tried
to
keep
calm
,
and
to
explain
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
were
yo'r
own
mother
,
Sylvia
,
as
knowed
yo
'
had
no
brother
,
or
any
one
to
see
after
yo
'
;
and
yo
'
<EOS>
so
pretty
,
so
pretty
,
Sylvia
,
"
he
continued
,
shaking
his
head
,
sadly
,
"
that
men
run
after
yo
'
against
their
will
,
as
one
may
say
;
and
yo'r
mother
bade
me
watch
o'er
ye
and
see
what
company
yo

kept

and
who

following
after

,
and
to

,
if

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
mother
niver
bade
yo
'
to
come
spying
after
me
,
and
blaming
me
for
seeing
a
lad
as
my
feyther
thinks
well
on

<EOS>
An
'
I
do
n't
believe
a

about
Annie

;
an
'
I
'm
not
going
to
suffer

out

'll
say
to
yo

.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Sylvie
,
Sylvie
,
"
cried
poor
Philip
,
as
his
offended
cousin
rushed
past
him
,
and
upstairs
to
her
little
bedroom
,
where
he
heard
the
sound
of
the
wooden
bolt
flying
into
its
place
.
<EOS>
He
could
hear
her
feet
pacing
quickly
about
through
the
unceiled
rafters
.
<EOS>
He
sate
still
in
despair
,
his
head
buried
in
his
two
hands
.
<EOS>
He
sate
till
it
grew
dusk
,
dark
;
the
wood
fire
,
not
gathered
together
by
careful
hands
,
died
out
into
gray
ashes
.
<EOS>
Dolly
Reid
had
done
her
work
and
gone
home
.
<EOS>
There
were
but
Philip
and
Sylvia
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
knew
he
ought
to
be
going
home
,
for
he
had
much
to
do
,
and
many
arrangements
to
make
.
<EOS>
Yet
it
seemed
as
though
he
could
not
stir
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
raised
his
stiffened
body
,
and
stood
up
,
dizzy
.
<EOS>
Up
the
little
wooden
stairs
he
went
,
where
he
had
never
been
before
,
to
the
small
square
landing
,
almost
filled
up
with
the
great
chest
for
oat
-
cake
.
<EOS>
He
breathed
hard
for
a
minute
,
and
then
knocked
at
the
door
of
Sylvia
's
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sylvie
!
<EOS>
I
'm
going
away
;
say
good
-
by
.
"
<EOS>
No
answer
.
<EOS>
Not
a
sound
heard
.
<EOS>
"
Sylvie
!
"
<EOS>
(
a
little
louder
,
and
less
hoarsely
spoken
)
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
reply
.
"
<EOS>
Sylvie
!
<EOS>
I
shall
be
a
long
time
away
;
perhaps
I
may
niver
come
back
at
all
"
;
here
he
bitterly
thought
of
an
unregarded
death
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Say
good
-
by
.
"
<EOS>
No
answer
.
<EOS>
He
waited
patiently
.
<EOS>
Can
she
be
wearied
out
,
and
gone
to
sleep
,
he
wondered
.
<EOS>
Yet
once
again
 
"
Good
-
by
,
Sylvie
,
and
God
bless
yo
'
!
<EOS>
I
'm
sorry
I
vexed
yo
'
.
"
  
<EOS>
No
reply
.
  
<EOS>
With
a
heavy
,
heavy
heart
he
creaked
down
the
stairs
,
felt
for
his
cap
,
and
left
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
warned
,
any
way
,
"
thought
he
.
<EOS>
Just
at
that
moment
the
little
casement
window
of
Sylvia
's
room
was
opened
,
and
she
said
    
"
Good
-
by
,
Philip
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
window
was
shut
again
as
soon
as
the
words
were
spoken
.
<EOS>
Philip
knew
the
uselessness
of
remaining
;
the
need
for
his
departure
;
and
yet
he
stood
still
for
a
little
time
like
one
entranced
,
as
if
his
will
had
lost
all
power
to
compel
him
to
leave
the
place
.
<EOS>
Those
two
words
of
hers
,
which
two
hours
before
would
have
been
so
far
beneath
his
aspirations
,
had
now
power
to
re
-
light
hope
,
to
quench
reproach
or
blame
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
but
a
young
lassie
,
"
said
he
to
himself
;
"
an
'
Kinraid
has
been
playing
wi
'
her
,
as
such
as
he
ca
n't
help
doing
,
once
they
get
among
the
women
.
<EOS>
An
'
<EOS>
I
came
down
sudden
on
her
about
Annie
Coulson
,
and
touched
her
pride
.
<EOS>
Maybe
,
too
,
it
were
ill
advised
to
tell
her
how
her
mother
was
feared
for
her
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
ha
'
left
the
place
to
-
morrow
if
he
'd
been
biding
here
;
but
he
's
off
for
half
a
year
or
so
,
and
I
'll
be
home
again
as
soon
as
iver
I
can
.
<EOS>
In
half
a
year
such
as
he
forgets
,
if
iver
he
's
thought
serious
about
her
;
but
in
a
'
my
lifetime
,
if
I
live
to
fourscore
,
I
can
niver
forget
.
<EOS>
God
bless
her
for
saying
,
"
Good
-
by
,
Philip
.
"
<EOS>
"
He
repeated
the
words
aloud
in
fond
mimicry
of
her
tones
:
"
Good
-
by
,
Philip
.
"
    
<EOS>
EDDY
IN
LOVE
'S
CURRENT
  
<EOS>
The
next
morning
shone
bright
and
clear
,
if
ever
a
March
morning
did
.
<EOS>
The
beguiling
month
was
coming
in
like
a
lamb
,
with
whatever
storms
it
might
go
raging
out
.
<EOS>
It
was
long
since
Philip
had
tasted
the
freshness
of
the
early
air
on
the
shore
,
or
in
the
country
,
as
his
employment
at
the
shop
detained
him
in
Monkshaven
till
the
evening
.
<EOS>
And
as
he
turned
down
the
quays
(
or
staithes
)
on
the
north
side
of
the
river
,
towards
the
shore
,
and
met
the
fresh
sea
-
breeze
blowing
right
in
his
face
,
it
was
impossible
not
to
feel
bright
and
elastic
.
<EOS>
With
his
knapsack
slung
over
his
shoulder
,
he
was
prepared
for
a
good
stretch
towards
Hartlepool
,
whence
a
coach
would
take
him
to
Newcastle
before
night
.
<EOS>
For
seven
or
eight
miles
the
level
sands
were
as
short
and
far
more
agreeable
a
road
than
the
up
and
down
land
-
ways
.
<EOS>
Philip
walked
on
pretty
briskly
,
unconsciously
enjoying
the
sunny
landscape
before
him
;
the
crisp
curling
waves
rushing
almost
up
to
his
feet
,
on
his
right
hand
,
and
then
swishing
back
over
the
fine
small
pebbles
into
the
great
swelling
sea
.
<EOS>
To
his
left
were
the
cliffs
rising
one
behind
another
,
having
deep
gullies
here
and
there
between
,
with
long
green
slopes
upward
from
the
land
,
and
then
sudden
falls
of
brown
and
red
soil
or
rock
deepening
to
a
yet
greater
richness
of
colour
at
their
base
towards
the
blue
ocean
before
him
.
<EOS>
The
loud
,
monotonous
murmur
of
the
advancing
and
receding
waters
lulled
him
into
dreaminess
;
the
sunny
look
of
everything
tinged
his
day
-
dreams
with
hope
.
<EOS>
So
he
trudged
merrily
over
the
first
mile
or
so
;
not
an
obstacle
to
his
measured
pace
on
the
hard
,
level
pavement
;
not
a
creature
to
be
seen
since
he
had
left
the
little
gathering
of
bare
-
legged
urchins
dabbling
in
the
sea
-
pools
near
Monkshaven
.
<EOS>
The
cares
of
land
were
shut
out
by
the
glorious
barrier
of
rocks
before
him
.
<EOS>
There
were
some
great
masses
that
had
been
detached
by
the
action
of
the
weather
,
and
lay
half
embedded
in
the
sand
,
draperied
over
by
the
heavy
pendent
olive
-
green
seaweed
.
<EOS>
The
waves
were
nearer
at
this
point
;
the
advancing
sea
came
up
with
a
mighty
distant
length
of
roar
;
here
and
there
the
smooth
swell
was
lashed
by
the
fret
against
unseen
rocks
into
white
breakers
;
but
otherwise
the
waves
came
up
from
the
German
Ocean
upon
that
English
shore
with
a
long
steady
roll
that
might
have
taken
its
first
impetus
far
away
,
in
the
haunt
of
the
sea
-
serpent
on
the
coast
of
"
Norroway
over
the
foam
.
<EOS>
"
The
air
was
soft
as
May
;
right
overhead
the
sky
was
blue
,
but
it
deadened
into
gray
near
the
sea
lines
.
<EOS>
Flocks
of
seagulls
hovered
about
the
edge
of
the
waves
,
slowly
rising
and
turning
their
white
under
-
plumage
to
glimmer
in
the
sunlight
as
Philip
approached
.
<EOS>
The
whole
scene
was
so
peaceful
,
so
soothing
,
that
it
dispelled
the
cares
and
fears
(
too
well
founded
in
fact
)
which
had
weighed
down
on
his
heart
during
the
dark
hours
of
the
past
night
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
Haytersbank
gully
opening
down
its
green
entrance
among
the
warm
brown
bases
of
the
cliffs
.
<EOS>
Below
,
in
the
sheltered
brushwood
,
among
the
last
year
's
withered
leaves
,
some
primroses
might
be
found
.
<EOS>
He
half
thought
of
gathering
Sylvia
a
posy
of
them
,
and
rushing
up
to
the
farm
to
make
a
little
farewell
peace
-
offering
.
<EOS>
But
on
looking
at
his
watch
,
he
put
all
thoughts
of
such
an
action
out
of
his
head
;
it
was
above
an
hour
later
than
he
had
supposed
,
and
he
must
make
all
haste
on
to
Hartlepool
.
<EOS>
Just
as
he
was
approaching
this
gully
,
a
man
came
dashing
down
,
and
ran
out
some
way
upon
the
sand
with
the
very
force
of
his
descent
;
then
he
turned
to
the
left
and
took
the
direction
of
Hartlepool
a
hundred
yards
or
so
in
advance
of
Philip
.
<EOS>
He
never
stayed
to
look
round
him
,
but
went
swiftly
and
steadily
on
his
way
.
<EOS>
By
the
peculiar
lurch
in
his
walk
 
by
everything
 
Philip
knew
it
was
the
specksioneer
,
Kinraid
.
  
<EOS>
Now
the
road
up
Haytersbank
gully
led
to
the
farm
,
and
nowhere
else
.
<EOS>
Still
any
one
wishing
to
descend
to
the
shore
might
do
so
by
first
going
up
to
the
Robsons
'
house
,
and
skirting
the
walls
till
they
came
to
the
little
slender
path
down
to
the
shore
.
<EOS>
But
by
the
farm
,
by
the
very
house
-
door
they
must
of
necessity
pass
.
<EOS>
Philip
slackened
his
pace
,
keeping
under
the
shadow
of
the
rock
.
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
Kinraid
,
walking
on
the
sunlight
open
sands
,
turned
round
and
looked
long
and
earnestly
towards
Haytersbank
gully
.
<EOS>
Hepburn
paused
when
he
paused
,
but
as
intently
as
he
looked
at
some
object
above
,
so
intently
did
Hepburn
look
at
him
.
<EOS>
No
need
to
ascertain
by
sight
towards
whom
his
looks
,
his
thoughts
were
directed
.
<EOS>
He
took
off
his
hat
and
waved
it
,
touching
one
part
of
it
as
if
with
particular
meaning
.
<EOS>
When
he
turned
away
at
last
,
Hepburn
heaved
a
heavy
sigh
,
and
crept
yet
more
into
the
cold
dank
shadow
of
the
cliffs
.
<EOS>
Each
step
was
now
a
heavy
task
,
his
sad
heart
tired
and
weary
.
<EOS>
After
a
while
he
climbed
up
a
few
feet
,
so
as
to
mingle
his
form
yet
more
completely
with
the
stones
and
rocks
around
.
<EOS>
Stumbling
over
the
uneven
and
often
jagged
points
,
slipping
on
the
sea
-
weed
,
plunging
into
little
pools
of
water
left
by
the
ebbing
tide
in
some
natural
basins
,
he
yet
kept
his
eyes
fixed
as
if
in
fascination
on
Kinraid
,
and
made
his
way
almost
alongside
of
him
.
<EOS>
But
the
last
hour
had
pinched
Hepburn
's
features
into
something
of
the
wan
haggardness
they
would
wear
when
he
should
first
be
lying
still
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
the
two
men
were
drawing
near
a
creek
,
about
eight
miles
from
Monkshaven
.
<EOS>
The
creek
was
formed
by
a
beck
(
or
small
stream
)
that
came
flowing
down
from
the
moors
,
and
took
its
way
to
the
sea
between
the
widening
rocks
.
<EOS>
The
melting
of
the
snows
and
running
of
the
flooded
water
-
springs
above
made
this
beck
in
the
early
spring
-
time
both
deep
and
wide
.
<EOS>
Hepburn
knew
that
here
they
both
must
take
a
path
leading
inland
to
a
narrow
foot
-
bridge
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
up
the
stream
;
indeed
from
this
point
,
owing
to
the
jutting
out
of
the
rocks
,
the
land
path
was
the
shortest
;
and
this
way
lay
by
the
water
-
side
at
an
angle
right
below
the
cliff
to
which
Hepburn
's
steps
were
leading
him
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
on
this
long
level
field
path
he
might
easily
be
seen
by
any
one
following
;
nay
,
if
he
followed
any
one
at
a
short
distance
,
for
it
was
full
of
turnings
;
and
he
resolved
,
late
as
he
was
,
to
sit
down
for
a
while
till
Kinraid
was
far
enough
in
advance
for
him
to
escape
being
seen
.
<EOS>
He
came
up
to
the
last
rock
behind
which
he
could
be
concealed
;
seven
or
eight
feet
above
the
stream
he
stood
,
and
looked
cautiously
for
the
specksioneer
.
<EOS>
Up
by
the
rushing
stream
he
looked
,
then
right
below
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
God
's
providence
,
"
he
murmured
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
God
's
providence
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
crouched
down
where
he
had
been
standing
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
.
<EOS>
He
tried
to
deafen
as
well
as
to
blind
himself
,
that
he
might
neither
hear
nor
see
anything
of
the
coming
event
of
which
he
,
an
inhabitant
of
Monkshaven
at
that
day
,
well
understood
the
betokening
signs
.
  
<EOS>
Kinraid
had
taken
the
larger
angle
of
the
sands
before
turning
up
towards
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
He
came
along
now
nearing
the
rocks
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
he
was
sufficiently
buoyant
to
whistle
to
himself
.
<EOS>
It
steeled
Philip
's
heart
to
what
was
coming
to
hear
his
rival
whistling
,
"
Weel
may
the
keel
row
,
"
so
soon
after
parting
with
Sylvia
.
  
<EOS>
The
instant
Kinraid
turned
the
corner
of
the
cliff
,
the
ambush
was
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Four
man
-
of
-
war
's
men
sprang
on
him
and
strove
to
pinion
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
King
's
name
!
"
cried
they
,
with
rough
,
triumphant
jeers
.
  
<EOS>
Their
boat
was
moored
not
a
dozen
yards
above
;
they
were
sent
by
the
tender
of
a
frigate
lying
off
Hartlepool
for
fresh
water
.
<EOS>
The
tender
was
at
anchor
just
beyond
the
jutting
rocks
in
face
.
  
<EOS>
They
knew
that
fishermen
were
in
the
habit
of
going
to
and
from
their
nets
by
the
side
of
the
creek
;
but
such
a
prize
as
this
active
,
strong
,
and
evidently
superior
sailor
,
was
what
they
had
not
hoped
for
,
and
their
endeavours
to
secure
him
were
in
proportion
to
the
value
of
the
prize
.
  
<EOS>
Although
taken
by
surprise
,
and
attacked
by
so
many
,
Kinraid
did
not
lose
his
wits
.
<EOS>
He
wrenched
himself
free
,
crying
out
loud
:
  
"
Avast
,
I
'm
a
protected
whaler
.
<EOS>
I
claim
my
protection
.
<EOS>
I
've
my
papers
to
show
,
I
'm
bonded
specksioneer
to
the
_
Urania
_
whaler
,
Donkin
captain
,
North
Shields
port
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
a
protected
whaler
,
the
press
-
gang
had
,
by
the
17th
section
of
Act
26
Geo
.
<EOS>
III
.
<EOS>
no
legal
right
to
seize
him
,
unless
he
had
failed
to
return
to
his
ship
by
the
10th
March
following
the
date
of
his
bond
.
<EOS>
But
of
what
use
were
the
papers
he
hastily
dragged
out
of
his
breast
;
of
what
use
were
laws
in
those
days
of
slow
intercourse
with
such
as
<EOS>
were
powerful
enough
to
protect
,
and
in
the
time
of
popular
panic
against
a
French
invasion
?
  
<EOS>
"
D
 
n
your
protection
,
"
cried
the
leader
of
the
press
-
gang
;
"
come
and
serve
his
Majesty
<EOS>
,
that
's
better
than
catching
whales
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
though
?
"
said
the
specksioneer
,
with
a
motion
of
his
hand
,
which
the
swift
-
eyed
sailor
opposed
to
him
saw
and
interpreted
rightly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thou
wilt
,
wilt
thou
?
<EOS>
Close
with
him
,
Jack
;
and
ware
the
cutlass
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
In
a
minute
his
cutlass
was
forced
from
him
,
and
it
became
a
hand
-
to
-
hand
struggle
,
of
which
,
from
the
difference
in
numbers
,
it
was
not
difficult
to
foretell
the
result
.
<EOS>
Yet
Kinraid
made
desperate
efforts
to
free
himself
;
he
wasted
no
breath
in
words
,
but
fought
,
as
the
men
said
,
"
like
a
very
devil
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hepburn
heard
loud
pants
of
breath
,
great
thuds
,
the
dull
struggle
of
limbs
on
the
sand
,
the
growling
curses
of
those
who
thought
to
have
managed
their
affair
more
easily
;
the
sudden
cry
of
some
one
wounded
,
not
Kinraid
<EOS>
he
knew
,
Kinraid
would
have
borne
any
pain
in
silence
at
such
a
moment
;
another
wrestling
,
swearing
,
infuriated
strife
,
and
then
a
strange
silence
.
<EOS>
Hepburn
sickened
at
the
heart
;
was
then
his
rival
dead
?
<EOS>
had
he
left
this
bright
world
?
<EOS>
lost
his
life
 
his
love
?
<EOS>
For
an
instant
Hepburn
felt
guilty
of
his
death
;
he
said
to
himself
he
had
never
wished
him
dead
,
and
yet
in
the
struggle
he
had
kept
aloof
,
and
now
it
might
be
too
late
for
ever
.
<EOS>
Philip
could
not
bear
the
suspense
;
he
looked
stealthily
round
the
corner
of
the
rock
behind
which
he
had
been
hidden
,
and
saw
that
they
had
overpowered
Kinraid
,
and
,
too
exhausted
to
speak
,
were
binding
him
hand
and
foot
to
carry
him
to
their
boat
.
  
<EOS>
Kinraid
lay
as
still
as
any
hedgehog
:
he
rolled
when
they
pushed
him
;
he
suffered
himself
to
be
dragged
without
any
resistance
,
any
motion
;
the
strong
colour
brought
into
his
face
while
fighting
was
gone
now
,
his
countenance
was
livid
pale
;
his
lips
were
tightly
held
together
,
as
if
it
cost
him
more
effort
to
be
passive
,
wooden
,
and
stiff
in
their
hands
than
it
had
done
to
fight
and
struggle
with
all
his
might
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
seemed
the
only
part
about
him
that
showed
cognizance
of
what
was
going
on
.
<EOS>
They
were
watchful
,
vivid
,
fierce
as
those
of
a
wild
cat
brought
to
bay
,
seeking
in
its
desperate
quickened
brain
for
some
mode
of
escape
not
yet
visible
,
and
in
all
probability
never
to
become
visible
to
the
hopeless
creature
in
its
supreme
agony
.
  
<EOS>
Without
a
motion
of
his
head
,
he
was
perceiving
and
taking
in
everything
while
he
lay
bound
at
the
bottom
of
the
boat
.
<EOS>
A
sailor
sat
by
his
side
,
who
had
been
hurt
by
a
blow
from
him
.
<EOS>
The
man
held
his
head
in
his
hand
,
moaning
;
but
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
he
revenged
himself
by
a
kick
at
the
prostrate
specksioneer
,
till
even
his
comrades
stopped
their
cursing
and
swearing
at
their
prisoner
for
the
trouble
he
had
given
them
,
to
cry
shame
on
their
comrade
.
<EOS>
But
Kinraid
never
spoke
,
nor
shrank
from
the
outstretched
foot
.
  
<EOS>
One
of
his
captors
,
with
the
successful
insolence
of
victory
,
ventured
to
jeer
him
on
the
supposed
reason
for
his
vehement
and
hopeless
resistance
.
  
<EOS>
He
might
have
said
yet
more
insolent
things
;
the
kicks
might
have
hit
harder
;
Kinraid
did
not
hear
or
heed
.
<EOS>
His
soul
was
beating
itself
against
the
bars
of
inflexible
circumstance
;
reviewing
in
one
terrible
instant
of
time
what
had
been
,
what
might
have
been
,
what
was
.
<EOS>
Yet
while
these
thoughts
thus
stabbed
him
,
he
was
still
mechanically
looking
out
for
chances
.
<EOS>
He
moved
his
head
a
little
,
so
as
to
turn
towards
Haytersbank
,
where
Sylvia
must
be
quickly
,
if
sadly
,
going
about
her
simple
daily
work
;
and
then
his
quick
eye
caught
Hepburn
's
face
,
blanched
with
excitement
rather
than
fear
,
watching
eagerly
from
behind
the
rock
,
where
he
had
sat
breathless
during
the
affray
and
the
impressment
of
his
rival
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
here
,
lad
!
"
<EOS>
shouted
the
specksioneer
as
soon
as
he
saw
Philip
,
heaving
and
writhing
his
body
the
while
with
so
much
vigour
that
the
sailors
started
away
from
the
work
they
were
engaged
in
about
the
boat
,
and
held
him
down
once
more
,
as
if
afraid
he
should
break
the
strong
rope
that
held
him
like
withes
of
green
flax
.
<EOS>
But
the
bound
man
had
no
such
notion
in
his
head
.
<EOS>
His
mighty
wish
was
to
call
Hepburn
near
that
he
might
send
some
message
by
him
to
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
"
Come
here
,
Hepburn
,
"
he
cried
again
,
falling
back
this
time
so
weak
and
exhausted
that
the
man
-
of
-
war
's
men
became
sympathetic
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
down
,
peeping
Tom
,
and
do
n't
be
afeared
,
"
they
called
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
afeared
,
"
said
Philip
;
"
I
'm
no
sailor
for
yo
'
t
'
impress
me
:
nor
have
yo
'
any
right
to
take
that
fellow
;
he
's
a
Greenland
specksioneer
,
under
protection
,
as
I
know
and
can
testify
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yo
'
and
yo'r
testify
go
hang
.
<EOS>
Make
haste
,
man
and
hear
what
this
gem'man
,
as
was
in
a
dirty
blubbery
whale
-
ship
,
and
is
now
in
his
Majesty
's
service
,
has
got
to
say
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
,
Jack
,
"
went
on
the
speaker
,
"
it
's
some
message
to
his
sweetheart
,
asking
her
to
come
for
to
serve
on
board
ship
along
with
he
,
like
Billy
Taylor
's
young
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
was
coming
towards
them
slowly
,
not
from
want
of
activity
,
but
because
he
was
undecided
what
he
should
be
called
upon
to
do
or
to
say
by
the
man
whom
he
hated
and
dreaded
,
yet
whom
just
now
he
could
not
help
admiring
.
  
<EOS>
Kinraid
groaned
with
impatience
at
seeing
one
,
free
to
move
with
quick
decision
,
so
slow
and
dilatory
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
on
then
,
"
cried
the
sailors
,
"
or
we
'll
take
you
too
on
board
,
and
run
you
up
and
down
the
main
-
mast
a
few
times
.
<EOS>
Nothing
like
life
aboard
ship
for
quickening
a
land
-
lubber
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yo'd
better
take
him
and
leave
me
,
"
said
Kinraid
,
grimly
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
been
taught
my
lesson
;
and
seemingly
he
has
his
yet
to
learn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
Majesty
is
n't
a
schoolmaster
to
need
scholars
;
but
a
jolly
good
captain
to
need
men
,
"
replied
the
leader
of
the
gang
,
eyeing
Philip
nevertheless
,
and
questioning
within
himself
how
far
,
with
only
two
other
available
men
,
they
durst
venture
on
his
capture
as
well
as
the
specksioneer
's
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
done
,
he
thought
,
even
though
there
was
this
powerful
captive
aboard
,
and
the
boat
to
manage
too
;
but
,
running
his
eye
over
Philip
's
figure
<EOS>
,
he
decided
that
the
tall
stooping
fellow
was
never
cut
out
for
a
sailor
,
and
that
he
should
get
small
thanks
if
he
captured
him
,
to
pay
him
for
the
possible
risk
of
losing
the
other
.
<EOS>
Or
else
the
mere
fact
of
being
a
landsman
was
of
as
little
consequence
to
the
press
-
gang
,
as
the
protecting
papers
which
Kinraid
had
vainly
showed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yon
fellow
would
n't
have
been
worth
his
grog
this
many
a
day
,
and
be
d
 
<EOS>
d
to
you
<EOS>
,
"
said
he
,
catching
Hepburn
by
the
shoulder
,
and
giving
him
a
push
.
<EOS>
Philip
stumbled
over
something
in
this
,
his
forced
run
.
<EOS>
He
looked
down
;
his
foot
had
caught
in
Kinraid
's
hat
,
which
had
dropped
off
in
the
previous
struggle
.
<EOS>
In
the
band
that
went
round
the
low
crown
,
a
ribbon
was
knotted
;
a
piece
of
that
same
ribbon
which
Philip
had
chosen
out
,
with
such
tender
hope
,
to
give
to
Sylvia
for
the
Corneys
'
party
on
new
year
's
eve
.
<EOS>
He
knew
every
delicate
thread
that
made
up
the
briar
-
rose
pattern
;
and
a
spasm
of
hatred
towards
Kinraid
contracted
his
heart
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
almost
relenting
into
pity
for
the
man
captured
before
his
eyes
;
now
he
abhorred
him
.
  
<EOS>
Kinraid
did
not
speak
for
a
minute
or
two
.
<EOS>
The
sailors
,
who
had
begun
to
take
him
into
favour
,
were
all
agog
with
curiosity
to
hear
the
message
to
his
sweetheart
,
which
they
believed
he
was
going
to
send
.
<EOS>
Hepburn
's
perceptions
,
quickened
with
his
vehement
agitation
of
soul
,
were
aware
of
this
feeling
of
theirs
;
and
it
increased
his
rage
against
Kinraid
,
who
had
exposed
the
idea
of
Sylvia
to
be
the
subject
of
ribald
whispers
.
<EOS>
But
the
specksioneer
cared
little
what
others
said
or
thought
about
the
maiden
,
whom
he
yet
saw
before
his
closed
eyelids
as
she
stood
watching
him
,
from
the
Haytersbank
gully
,
waving
her
hands
,
her
handkerchief
,
all
in
one
passionate
farewell
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
yo
'
want
wi
'
me
?
"
asked
Hepburn
at
last
in
a
gloomy
tone
.
<EOS>
If
he
could
have
helped
it
,
he
would
have
kept
silence
till
Kinraid
spoke
first
;
but
he
could
no
longer
endure
the
sailors

"
Tell
Sylvia
,
"
said
Kinraid
      
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
smart
name
for
a
sweetheart
,
"
exclaimed
one
of
the
men
;
but
Kinraid
went
straight
on
,
    
<EOS>
"
What
yo've
seen
;
how
I
've
been
pressed
by
this
cursed
gang
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Civil
words
,
messmate
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
ca
n't
abide
cursing
and
swearing
,
I
'm
sure
.
<EOS>
We
're
gentlemen
serving
his
Majesty
on
board
the
_
Alcestis
_
,
and
this
proper
young
fellow
shall
be
helped
on
to
more
honour
and
glory
than
he
'd
ever
get
bobbing
for
whales
.
<EOS>
Tell
Sylvia
this
,
with
my
love
;
Jack
Carter
's
love
,
if
she
's
anxious
about
my
name
.
"
  
<EOS>
One
of
the
sailors
laughed
at
this
rude
humour
;
another
bade
Carter
hold
his
stupid
tongue
.
<EOS>
Philip
hated
him
in
his
heart
.
<EOS>
Kinraid
hardly
heard
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
growing
faint
with
the
heavy
blows
he
had
received
,
the
stunning
fall
he
had
met
with
,
and
the
reaction
from
his
dogged
self
-
control
at
first
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
did
not
speak
nor
move
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
her
,
"
continued
Kinraid
,
rousing
himself
for
another
effort
,
"
what
yo've
seen
.
<EOS>
Tell
her
I
'll
come
back
to
her
.
<EOS>
Bid
her
not
forget
the
great
oath
we
took
together
this
morning
;
she
's
as
much
<EOS>
my
wife
<EOS>
as
if
we
'd
gone
to
church
;
 
<EOS>
I
'll
come
back
and
marry
her
afore
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
said
something
inarticulately
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hurra
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Carter
,
"
and
I
'll
be
best
man
.
<EOS>
Tell
her
,
too
that
I
'll
have
an
eye
on
her
sweetheart
,
and
keep
him
from
running
after
other
girls
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yo'll
have
yo'r
hands
full
,
then
,
"
muttered
Philip
,
his
passion
boiling
over
at
the
thought
of
having
been
chosen
out
from
among
all
men
to
convey
such
a
message
as
Kinraid
's
to
Sylvia
.
  
<EOS>
"
Make
an
end
of
yo'r
d
 
d
yarns
,
and
be
off
,
"
said
the
man
who
had
been
hurt
by
Kinraid
,
and
who
had
sate
apart
and
silent
till
now
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
turned
away
;
Kinraid
raised
himself
and
cried
after
him
,
    
"
Hepburn
,
Hepburn
!
<EOS>
tell
her
   
'
what
he
added
Philip
could
not
hear
,
for
the
words
were
lost
before
they
reached
him
in
the
outward
noise
of
the
regular
splash
of
the
oars
and
the
rush
of
the
wind
down
the
gully
,
with
which
mingled
the
closer
sound
that
filled
his
ears
of
his
own
hurrying
blood
surging
up
into
his
brain
.
<EOS>
He
was
conscious
that
he
had
said
something
in
reply
to
Kinraid
's
adjuration
that
he
would
deliver
his
message
to
Sylvia
,
at
the
very
time
when
Carter
had
stung
him
into
fresh
anger
by
the
allusion
to
the
possibility
of
the
specksioneer
's
"
running
after
other
girls
,
"
for
,
for
an
instant
,
Hepburn
had
been
touched
by
the
contrast
of
circumstances
.
<EOS>
Kinraid
an
hour
or
two
ago
,
 
Kinraid
a
banished
man
;
for
in
those
days
,
an
impressed
sailor
might
linger
out
years
on
some
foreign
station
,
far
from
those
he
loved
,
who
all
this
time
remained
ignorant
of
his
cruel
fate
.
  
<EOS>
But
Hepburn
began
to
wonder
what
he
himself
had
said
 
how
much
of
a
promise
he
had
made
to
deliver
those
last
passionate
words
of
Kinraid
's
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
recollect
how
much
,
how
little
he
had
said
;
he
knew
he
had
spoken
hoarsely
and
low
almost
at
the
same
time
as
Carter
had
uttered
his
loud
joke
.
<EOS>
But
he
doubted
if
Kinraid
had
caught
his
words
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
the
dread
Inner
Creature
,
who
lurks
in
each
of
our
hearts
,
arose
and
said
,
"
It
is
as
well
:
a
promise
given
is
a
fetter
to
the
giver
.
<EOS>
But
a
promise
is
not
given
when
it
has
not
been
received
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
a
sudden
impulse
,
he
turned
again
towards
the
shore
when
he
had
crossed
the
bridge
,
and
almost
ran
towards
the
verge
of
the
land
.
<EOS>
Then
he
threw
himself
down
on
the
soft
fine
turf
that
grew
on
the
margin
of
the
cliffs
overhanging
the
sea
,
and
commanding
an
extent
of
view
towards
the
north
.
<EOS>
His
face
supported
by
his
hands
,
he
looked
down
upon
the
blue
rippling
ocean
,
flashing
here
<EOS>
and
there
,
into
the
sunlight
in
long
,
glittering
lines
.
<EOS>
The
boat
was
still
in
the
distance
,
making
her
swift
silent
way
with
long
regular
bounds
to
the
tender
that
lay
in
the
offing
.
  
<EOS>
Hepburn
felt
insecure
,
as
in
a
nightmare
dream
,
so
long
as
the
boat
did
not
reach
her
immediate
destination
.
<EOS>
His
contracted
eyes
could
see
four
minute
figures
rowing
with
ceaseless
motion
,
and
a
fifth
sate
at
the
helm
.
<EOS>
But
he
knew
there
was
a
sixth
,
unseen
,
lying
,
bound
and
helpless
,
at
the
bottom
of
the
boat
;
and
his
fancy
kept
expecting
this
man
to
start
up
and
break
his
bonds
,
and
overcome
all
the
others
,
and
return
to
the
shore
free
and
triumphant
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
by
no
fault
of
Hepburn
's
that
the
boat
sped
well
away
;
that
she
was
now
alongside
the
tender
,
dancing
on
the
waves
;
now
emptied
of
her
crew
;
now
hoisted
up
to
her
place
.
<EOS>
No
fault
of
his
!
<EOS>
and
yet
it
took
him
some
time
before
he
could
reason
himself
into
the
belief
that
his
mad
,
feverish
wishes
not
an
hour
before
 
his
wild
prayer
to
be
rid
of
his
rival
,
as
he
himself
had
scrambled
onward
over
the
rocks
alongside
of
Kinraid
's
path
on
the
sands
 
had
not
compelled
the
event
.
  
<EOS>
"
Anyhow
,
"
thought
he
,
as
he
rose
up
,
"
my
prayer
is
granted
.
<EOS>
God
be
thanked
!
"
  
<EOS>
Once
more
he
looked
out
towards
the
ship
.
<EOS>
She
had
spread
her
beautiful
great
sails
,
and
was
standing
out
to
sea
in
the
glittering
path
of
the
descending
sun
.
  
<EOS>
He
saw
that
he
had
been
delayed
on
his
road
,
and
had
lingered
long
.
<EOS>
He
shook
his
stiffened
limbs
,
shouldered
his
knapsack
,
and
prepared
to
walk
on
to
Hartlepool
as
swiftly
as
he
could
.
    
<EOS>
AN
IMPORTANT
MISSION
  
<EOS>
Philip
was
too
late
for
the
coach
he
had
hoped
to
go
by
,
but
there
was
another
that
left
at
night
,
and
which
reached
Newcastle
in
the
forenoon
,
so
that
,
by
the
loss
of
a
night
's
sleep
,
he
might
overtake
his
lost
time
.
<EOS>
But
,
restless
and
miserable
,
he
could
not
stop
in
Hartlepool
longer
than
to
get
some
hasty
food
at
the
inn
from
which
the
coach
started
.
<EOS>
He
acquainted
himself
with
the
names
of
the
towns
through
which
it
would
pass
,
and
the
inns
at
which
it
would
stop
,
and
left
word
that
the
coachman
was
to
be
on
the
look
-
out
for
him
and
pick
him
up
at
some
one
of
these
places
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
thoroughly
worn
out
before
this
happened
 
too
much
tired
to
gain
any
sleep
in
the
coach
.
<EOS>
When
he
reached
Newcastle
,
he
went
to
engage
his
passage
in
the
next
London
-
bound
smack
,
and
then
directed
his
steps
to
Robinson
's
,
in
the
Side
,
to
make
all
the
inquiries
he
could
think
of
respecting
the
plough
his
uncle
wanted
to
know
about
.
  
<EOS>
So
it
was
pretty
late
in
the
afternoon
,
indeed
almost
evening
,
before
he
arrived
at
the
small
inn
on
the
quay
-
side
,
where
he
intended
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
It
was
but
a
rough
kind
of
place
,
frequented
principally
by
sailors
;
he
had
been
recommended
to
it
by
Daniel
Robson
,
who
had
known
it
well
in
former
days
.
<EOS>
The
accommodation
in
it
was
,
however
,
clean
and
homely
,
and
the
people
keeping
it
were
respectable
enough
in
their
way
.
  
<EOS>
Still
Hepburn
was
rather
repelled
by
the
appearance
of
the
sailors
who
sate
drinking
in
the
bar
,
and
he
asked
,
in
a
low
voice
,
if
there
was
not
another
room
.
<EOS>
The
woman
stared
in
surprise
,
and
only
shook
her
head
.
<EOS>
Hepburn
went
to
a
separate
table
,
away
from
the
roaring
fire
,
which
on
this
cold
March
evening
was
the
great
attraction
,
and
called
for
food
and
drink
.
<EOS>
Then
seeing
that
the
other
men
were
eyeing
him
with
the
sociable
idea
of
speaking
to
him
,
he
asked
for
pen
and
ink
and
paper
,
with
the
intention
of
defeating
their
purpose
by
pre
-
occupation
on
his
part
.
<EOS>
But
when
the
paper
came
,
the
new
pen
,
the
unused
thickened
ink
,
he
hesitated
long
before
he
began
to
write
;
and
at
last
he
slowly
put
down
the
words
,
    
"
DEAR
AND
HONOURED
UNCLE
,
"
      
<EOS>
There
was
a
pause
;
his
meal
was
brought
and
hastily
swallowed
.
<EOS>
Even
while
he
was
eating
it
,
he
kept
occasionally
touching
up
the
letters
of
these
words
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
drunk
a
glass
of
ale
<EOS>
he
began
again
to
write
:
fluently
this
time
,
for
he
was
giving
an
account
of
the
plough
.
<EOS>
Then
came
another
long
stop
;
he
was
weighing
in
his
own
mind
what
he
should
say
about
Kinraid
.
<EOS>
Once
he
thought
for
a
second
of
writing
to
Sylvia
herself
,
and
telling
her
   
how
much
?
<EOS>
She
might
treasure
up
her
lover
's
words
like
grains
of
gold
,
while
they
were
lighter
than
dust
in
their
meaning
to
Philip
's
mind
;
words
which
such
as
the
specksioneer
used
as
counters
to
beguile
and
lead
astray
silly
women
.
<EOS>
It
was
for
him
to
prove
his
constancy
by
action
;
and
the
chances
of
his
giving
such
proof
were
infinitesimal
in
Philip
's
estimation
.
<EOS>
But
should
the
latter
mention
the
bare
fact
of
Kinraid
's
impressment
to
Robson
?
<EOS>
That
would
have
been
the
natural
course
of
things
,
remembering
that
the
last
time
Philip
had
seen
either
,
they
were
in
each
other
's
company
.
<EOS>
Twenty
times
he
put
his
pen
to
the
paper
with
the
intention
of
relating
briefly
the
event
that
had
befallen
Kinraid
;
and
as
often
he
stopped
,
as
though
the
first
word
would
be
irrevocable
.
<EOS>
While
he
thus
sate
pen
in
hand
,
thinking
himself
wiser
than
conscience
,
and
looking
on
beyond
the
next
step
which
she
bade
him
take
into
an
indefinite
future
,
he
caught
some
fragments
of
the
sailors
'
talk
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
which
made
him
listen
to
their
words
.
<EOS>
They
were
speaking
of
that
very
Kinraid
,
the
thought
of
whom
filled
his
own
mind
like
an
actual
presence
.
<EOS>
In
a
rough
,
careless
way
they
spoke
of
the
specksioneer
,
with
admiration
enough
for
his
powers
as
a
sailor
and
harpooner
;
and
from
that
they
passed
on
to
jesting
mention
of
his
power
amongst
women
,
and
one
or
two
girls
'
names
were
spoken
of
in
connection
with
him
.
<EOS>
Hepburn
silently
added
Annie
Coulson
and
Sylvia
Robson
to
this
list
,
and
his
cheeks
turned
paler
as
he
did
so
.
<EOS>
Long
after
they
had
done
speaking
about
Kinraid
,
after
they
had
paid
their
shot
,
and
gone
away
,
he
sate
in
the
same
attitude
,
thinking
bitter
thoughts
.
  
<EOS>
The
people
of
the
house
prepared
for
bed
.
<EOS>
Their
silent
guest
took
no
heed
of
their
mute
signs
.
<EOS>
At
length
the
landlord
spoke
to
him
,
and
he
started
,
gathered
his
wits
together
with
an
effort
,
and
prepared
to
retire
with
the
rest
.
<EOS>
But
before
he
did
so
,
he
signed
and
directed
the
letter
to
his
uncle
,
leaving
it
still
open
,
however
,
in
case
some
sudden
feeling
should
prompt
him
to
add
a
postscript
.
<EOS>
The
landlord
volunteered
the
information
that
the
letter
his
guest
had
been
writing
must
be
posted
early
the
next
morning
if
it
was
going
south
;
as
the
mails
in
that
direction
only
left
Newcastle
every
other
day
.
  
<EOS>
All
night
long
Hepburn
wearied
himself
with
passionate
tossings
,
prompted
by
stinging
recollection
.
<EOS>
Towards
morning
he
fell
into
a
dead
sound
sleep
.
<EOS>
He
was
roused
by
a
hasty
knocking
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
It
was
broad
full
daylight
;
he
had
overslept
himself
,
and
the
smack
was
leaving
by
the
early
tide
.
<EOS>
He
was
even
now
summoned
on
board
.
<EOS>
He
dressed
,
wafered
his
letter
,
and
rushed
with
it
to
the
neighbouring
post
-
office
;
and
,
without
caring
to
touch
the
breakfast
for
which
he
paid
,
he
embarked
.
<EOS>
Once
on
board
,
he
experienced
the
relief
which
it
always
is
to
an
undecided
man
,
and
generally
is
at
first
to
any
one
who
has
been
paltering
with
duty
,
when
circumstances
decide
for
him
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
case
,
it
is
pleasant
to
be
relieved
from
the
burden
of
decision
;
in
the
second
,
the
responsibility
seems
to
be
shifted
on
to
impersonal
events
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
Philip
sailed
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
Tyne
on
to
the
great
open
sea
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
week
before
the
smack
reached
London
,
even
if
she
pursued
a
tolerably
straight
course
,
but
she
had
to
keep
a
sharp
look
-
out
after
possible
impressment
of
her
crew
;
and
it
was
not
until
after
many
dodges
and
some
adventures
that
,
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
from
the
time
of
his
leaving
Monkshaven
,
Philip
found
himself
safely
housed
in
London
,
and
ready
to
begin
the
delicate
piece
of
work
which
was
given
him
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
He
felt
himself
fully
capable
of
unravelling
each
clue
to
information
,
and
deciding
on
the
value
of
the
knowledge
so
gained
.
<EOS>
But
during
the
leisure
of
the
voyage
he
had
wisely
determined
to
communicate
everything
he
learnt
about
Dickinson
,
in
short
,
every
step
he
took
in
the
matter
,
by
letter
to
his
employers
.
<EOS>
And
thus
his
mind
both
in
and
out
of
his
lodgings
might
have
appeared
to
have
been
fully
occupied
with
the
concerns
of
others
.
  
<EOS>
But
there
were
times
when
the
miserable
luxury
of
dwelling
upon
his
own
affairs
was
his
 
when
he
lay
down
in
his
bed
till
he
fell
into
restless
sleep
 
when
the
point
to
which
his
steps
tended
in
his
walks
was
ascertained
.
<EOS>
Then
he
gave
himself
up
to
memory
,
and
regret
which
often
deepened
into
despair
,
and
but
seldom
was
cheered
by
hope
.
  
<EOS>
He
grew
so
impatient
of
the
ignorance
in
which
he
was
kept
 
for
in
those
days
of
heavy
postage
<EOS>
any
correspondence
he
might
have
had
on
mere
Monkshaven
intelligence
was
very
limited
 
<EOS>
as
to
the
affairs
at
Haytersbank
,
that
he
cut
out
an
advertisement
respecting
some
new
kind
of
plough
,
from
a
newspaper
that
lay
in
the
chop
-
house
where
he
usually
dined
,
and
rising
early
the
next
morning
he
employed
the
time
thus
gained
in
going
round
to
the
shop
where
these
new
ploughs
were
sold
.
  
<EOS>
That
night
he
wrote
another
letter
to
Daniel
Robson
,
with
a
long
account
of
the
merits
of
the
implements
he
had
that
day
seen
.
<EOS>
With
a
sick
heart
and
a
hesitating
hand
,
he
wound
up
with
a
message
of
regard
to
his
aunt
and
to
Sylvia
;
an
expression
of
regard
which
he
dared
not
make
as
warm
as
he
wished
,
and
which
,
consequently
,
fell
below
the
usual
mark
attained
by
such
messages
,
and
would
have
appeared
to
any
one
who
cared
to
think
about
it
as
cold
and
formal
.
  
<EOS>
When
this
letter
was
despatched
,
Hepburn
began
to
wonder
what
he
had
hoped
for
in
writing
it
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
Daniel
could
write
 
or
rather
that
he
could
make
strange
hieroglyphics
,
the
meaning
of
which
puzzled
others
and
often
himself
;
but
these
pen
-
and
-
ink
signs
were
seldom
employed
by
Robson
,
and
never
,
so
far
as
Philip
knew
,
for
the
purpose
of
letter
-
writing
.
<EOS>
But
still
he
craved
so
for
news
of
Sylvia
 
even
for
a
sight
of
paper
which
she
had
seen
,
and
perhaps
touched
 
that
he
thought
all
his
trouble
about
the
plough
(
to
say
nothing
of
the
one
-
and
-
twopence
postage
which
he
had
prepaid
in
order
to
make
sure
of
his
letter
's
reception
in
the
frugal
household
at
Haytersbank
)
well
lost
for
the
mere
chance
of
his
uncle
's
caring
enough
for
the
intelligence
to
write
in
reply
,
or
even
to
get
some
friend
to
write
an
answer
;
for
in
such
case
,
perhaps
,
Philip
might
see
her
name
mentioned
in
some
way
,
even
though
it
was
only
that
she
sent
her
duty
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
post
-
office
was
dumb
;
no
letter
came
from
Daniel
Robson
.
<EOS>
Philip
heard
,
it
is
true
,
from
his
employers
pretty
frequently
on
business
;
and
he
felt
sure
they
would
have
named
it
,
if
any
ill
had
befallen
his
uncle
's
family
,
for
they
knew
of
the
relationship
and
of
his
intimacy
there
.
<EOS>
They
generally
ended
their
formal
letters
with
as
formal
a
summary
of
Monkshaven
news
;
but
there
was
never
a
mention
of
the
Robsons
,
and
that
of
itself
was
well
,
but
it
did
not
soothe
Philip
's
impatient
curiosity
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
confided
his
attachment
to
his
cousin
to
any
one
,
it
was
not
his
way
;
but
he
sometimes
thought
that
if
Coulson
had
not
taken
his
present
appointment
to
a
confidential
piece
of
employment
so
ill
,
he
would
have
written
to
him
and
asked
him
to
go
up
to
Haytersbank
Farm
,
and
let
him
know
how
they
all
were
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
time
he
was
transacting
the
affair
on
which
he
had
been
sent
,
with
great
skill
;
and
,
indeed
,
in
several
ways
,
he
was
quietly
laying
the
foundation
for
enlarging
the
business
in
Monkshaven
.
<EOS>
Naturally
grave
and
quiet
,
and
slow
to
speak
,
he
impressed
those
who
saw
him
with
the
idea
of
greater
age
and
experience
than
he
really
possessed
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
those
who
encountered
him
in
London
,
thought
he
was
absorbed
in
the
business
of
money
-
making
.
<EOS>
Yet
before
the
time
came
when
he
could
wind
up
affairs
and
return
to
Monkshaven
,
he
would
have
given
all
he
possessed
for
a
letter
from
his
uncle
,
telling
him
something
about
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
For
he
still
hoped
to
hear
from
Robson
,
although
he
knew
that
he
hoped
against
reason
.
<EOS>
But
we
often
convince
ourselves
by
good
argument
that
what
we
wish
for
need
never
have
been
expected
;
and
then
,
at
the
end
of
our
reasoning
,
find
that
we
might
have
saved
ourselves
the
trouble
,
for
that
our
wishes
are
untouched
,
and
are
as
strong
enemies
to
our
peace
of
mind
as
ever
.
<EOS>
Hepburn
's
baulked
hope
was
the
Mordecai
sitting
in
Haman
's
gate
;
all
his
success
in
his
errand
to
London
,
his
well
-
doing
in
worldly
affairs
,
was
tasteless
,
and
gave
him
no
pleasure
,
because
of
this
blank
and
void
of
all
intelligence
concerning
Sylvia
.
  
<EOS>
And
yet
he
came
back
with
a
letter
from
the
Fosters
in
his
pocket
,
curt
,
yet
expressive
of
deep
gratitude
for
his
discreet
services
in
London
;
and
at
another
time
 
in
fact
,
if
Philip
's
life
had
been
ordered
differently
to
what
it
was
 
<EOS>
it
might
have
given
this
man
a
not
unworthy
pleasure
to
remember
that
,
without
a
penny
of
his
own
,
simply
by
diligence
,
honesty
,
and
faithful
quick
-
sightedness
as
to
the
interests
of
his
masters
<EOS>
,
he
had
risen
to
hold
the
promise
of
being
their
successor
,
and
to
be
ranked
by
them
as
a
trusted
friend
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
Newcastle
smack
neared
the
shore
on
her
voyage
home
,
Hepburn
looked
wistfully
out
for
the
faint
gray
outline
of
Monkshaven
Priory
against
the
sky
,
and
the
well
-
known
cliffs
;
as
if
the
masses
of
inanimate
stone
could
tell
him
any
news
of
Sylvia
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
streets
of
Shields
,
just
after
landing
,
he
encountered
a
neighbour
of
the
Robsons
,
and
an
acquaintance
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
By
this
honest
man
,
he
was
welcomed
as
a
great
traveller
is
welcomed
on
his
return
from
a
long
voyage
,
with
many
hearty
good
shakes
of
the
hand
,
much
repetition
of
kind
wishes
,
and
offers
to
treat
him
to
drink
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
from
some
insurmountable
feeling
,
Philip
avoided
all
mention
of
the
family
who
were
the
principal
bond
between
the
honest
farmer
and
himself
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
know
why
,
but
he
could
not
bear
the
shock
of
first
hearing
her
name
in
the
open
street
,
or
in
the
rough
public
-
house
.
<EOS>
And
thus
he
shrank
from
the
intelligence
he
craved
to
hear
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
he
knew
no
more
about
the
Robsons
when
he
returned
to
Monkshaven
,
than
he
had
done
on
the
day
when
he
had
last
seen
them
;
and
,
of
course
,
his
first
task
there
was
to
give
a
long
_
viva
<EOS>
voce
<EOS>
_
account
of
all
his
London
proceedings
to
the
two
brothers
Foster
,
who
,
considering
that
they
had
heard
the
result
of
everything
by
letter
,
seemed
to
take
an
insatiable
interest
in
details
.
  
<EOS>
He
could
hardly
tell
why
,
but
even
when
released
from
the
Fosters
'
parlour
,
he
was
unwilling
to
go
to
Haytersbank
Farm
.
<EOS>
It
was
late
,
it
is
true
,
but
on
a
May
evening
even
country
people
keep
up
till
eight
or
nine
o'clock
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
was
because
Hepburn
was
still
in
his
travel
-
stained
dress
;
having
gone
straight
to
the
shop
on
his
arrival
in
Monkshaven
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
was
because
,
if
he
went
this
night
for
the
short
half
-
hour
intervening
before
bed
-
time
,
he
would
have
no
excuse
for
paying
a
longer
visit
on
the
following
evening
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
he
proceeded
straight
to
Alice
Rose
's
,
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
his
interview
with
his
employers
.
  
<EOS>
Both
Hester
and
Coulson
had
given
him
their
welcome
home
in
the
shop
,
which
they
had
,
however
,
left
an
hour
or
two
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
they
gave
him
a
fresh
greeting
,
almost
one
in
which
surprise
was
blended
,
when
he
came
to
his
lodgings
.
<EOS>
Even
Alice
seemed
gratified
by
his
spending
this
first
evening
with
them
,
as
if
she
had
thought
it
might
have
been
otherwise
.
<EOS>
Weary
though
he
was
,
he
exerted
himself
to
talk
and
to
relate
what
he
had
done
and
seen
in
London
,
as
far
as
he
could
without
breaking
confidence
with
his
employers
.
<EOS>
It
was
something
to
see
the
pleasure
he
gave
to
his
auditors
,
although
there
were
several
mixed
feelings
in
their
minds
to
produce
the
expression
of
it
which
gratified
him
.
<EOS>
Coulson
was
sorry
for
his
former
ungenerous
reception
of
the
news
that
Philip
was
going
to
London
;
Hester
and
her
mother
each
secretly
began
to
feel
as
if
this
evening
was
like
more
happy
evenings
of
old
,
before
the
Robsons
came
to
Haytersbank
Farm
;
and
who
knows
what
faint
delicious
hopes
this
resemblance
may
not
have
suggested
?
  
<EOS>
While
Philip
,
restless
and
excited
,
feeling
that
he
could
not
sleep
,
was
glad
to
pass
away
the
waking
hours
that
must
intervene
before
to
-
morrow
night
,
at
times
,
he
tried
to
make
them
talk
of
what
had
happened
in
Monkshaven
during
his
absence
,
but
all
had
gone
on
in
an
eventless
manner
,
as
far
as
he
could
gather
;
if
they
knew
of
anything
affecting
the
Robsons
,
they
avoided
speaking
of
it
to
him
;
and
,
indeed
,
how
little
likely
were
they
ever
to
have
heard
their
names
while
he
was
away
?
    
<EOS>
LOVED
AND
LOST
  
<EOS>
Philip
walked
towards
the
Robsons
'
farm
like
a
man
in
a
dream
,
who
has
everything
around
him
according
to
his
wish
,
and
yet
is
conscious
of
a
secret
mysterious
inevitable
drawback
to
his
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
Hepburn
did
not
care
to
think
 
would
not
realize
what
this
drawback
,
which
need
not
have
been
mysterious
in
his
case
,
was
.
  
<EOS>
The
May
evening
was
glorious
in
light
and
shadow
.
<EOS>
The
crimson
sun
warmed
up
the
chilly
northern
air
to
a
semblance
of
pleasant
heat
.
<EOS>
The
spring
sights
and
sounds
were
all
about
;
the
lambs
were
bleating
out
their
gentle
weariness
before
they
sank
to
rest
by
the
side
of
their
mothers
;
the
linnets
were
chirping
in
every
bush
of
golden
gorse
that
grew
out
of
the
stone
walls
;
the
lark
was
singing
her
good
-
night
in
the
cloudless
sky
,
before
she
dropped
down
to
her
nest
in
the
tender
green
wheat
;
all
spoke
of
brooding
peace
 
but
Philip
's
heart
was
not
at
peace
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
he
was
going
to
proclaim
his
good
fortune
.
<EOS>
His
masters
had
that
day
publicly
announced
that
Coulson
and
he
were
to
be
their
successors
,
and
he
had
now
arrived
at
that
longed
-
for
point
in
his
business
,
when
he
had
resolved
to
openly
speak
of
his
love
to
Sylvia
,
and
might
openly
strive
to
gain
her
love
.
<EOS>
But
,
alas
!
<EOS>
the
fulfilment
of
that
wish
of
his
had
lagged
sadly
behind
.
<EOS>
He
was
placed
as
far
as
he
could
,
even
in
his
most
sanguine
moments
,
have
hoped
to
be
as
regarded
business
,
but
Sylvia
was
as
far
from
his
attainment
as
ever
 
nay
,
farther
.
<EOS>
Still
the
great
obstacle
was
removed
in
Kinraid
's
impressment
.
<EOS>
Philip
took
upon
himself
to
decide
that
,
with
such
a
man
as
the
specksioneer
,
absence
was
equivalent
to
faithless
forgetfulness
.
<EOS>
He
thought
that
he
had
just
grounds
for
this
decision
in
the
account
he
had
heard
of
Kinraid
's
behaviour
to
Annie
Coulson
;
to
the
other
nameless
young
girl
,
her
successor
in
his
fickle
heart
;
in
the
ribald
talk
of
the
sailors
in
the
Newcastle
public
-
house
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
well
for
Sylvia
if
she
could
forget
as
quickly
;
and
,
to
promote
this
oblivion
,
the
name
of
her
lover
should
never
be
brought
up
,
either
in
praise
or
blame
.
<EOS>
And
Philip
would
be
patient
and
enduring
;
all
the
time
watching
over
her
,
and
labouring
to
win
her
reluctant
love
.
  
<EOS>
There
she
was
!
<EOS>
He
saw
her
as
he
stood
at
the
top
of
the
little
hill
-
path
leading
down
to
the
Robsons
'
door
.
<EOS>
She
was
out
of
doors
,
in
the
garden
,
which
,
at
some
distance
from
the
house
,
sloped
up
the
bank
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
gully
;
much
too
far
off
to
be
spoken
to
 
not
too
far
off
to
be
gazed
at
by
eyes
that
caressed
her
every
movement
.
<EOS>
How
well
Philip
knew
that
garden
;
placed
long
ago
by
some
tenant
of
the
farm
on
a
southern
slope
;
walled
in
with
rough
moorland
stones
;
planted
with
berry
-
bushes
for
use
,
and
southernwood
and
sweet
-
briar
for
sweetness
of
smell
.
<EOS>
When
the
Robsons
had
first
come
to
Haytersbank
,
and
Sylvia
was
scarcely
more
than
a
pretty
child
,
how
well
he
remembered
helping
her
with
the
arrangement
of
this
garden
;
laying
out
his
few
spare
pence
in
hen
-
and
-
chicken
daisies
at
one
time
,
in
flower
-
seeds
at
another
;
again
in
a
rose
-
tree
in
a
pot
.
<EOS>
He
knew
how
his
unaccustomed
hands
had
laboured
with
the
spade
at
forming
a
little
primitive
bridge
over
the
beck
in
the
hollow
before
winter
streams
should
make
it
too
deep
for
fording
;
how
he
had
cut
down
branches
of
the
mountain
-
ash
and
covered
them
over
,
yet
decked
with
their
scarlet
berries
,
with
sods
of
green
turf
,
beyond
which
the
brilliancy
crept
out
;
but
now
it
was
months
and
years
since
he
had
been
in
that
garden
,
which
had
lost
its
charm
for
Sylvia
,
as
she
found
the
bleak
sea
-
winds
came
up
and
blighted
all
endeavours
at
cultivating
more
than
the
most
useful
things
 
pot
-
herbs
,
marigolds
,
potatoes
,
onions
,
and
such
-
like
.
<EOS>
Why
did
she
tarry
there
now
,
standing
quite
motionless
up
by
the
highest
bit
of
wall
,
looking
over
the
sea
,
with
her
hand
shading
her
eyes
?
<EOS>
Quite
motionless
;
as
if
she
were
a
stone
statue
.
<EOS>
He
began
to
wish
she
would
move
 
would
look
at
him
 
but
any
way
that
she
would
move
,
and
not
stand
gazing
thus
over
that
great
dreary
sea
.
  
<EOS>
He
went
down
the
path
with
an
impatient
step
,
and
entered
the
house
-
place
.
<EOS>
There
sat
his
aunt
spinning
,
and
apparently
as
well
as
ever
.
<EOS>
He
could
hear
his
uncle
talking
to
Kester
in
the
neighbouring
shippen
;
all
was
well
in
the
household
.
<EOS>
Why
was
Sylvia
standing
in
the
garden
in
that
strange
quiet
way
?
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
lad
!
<EOS>
thou'rt
a
sight
for
sair
een
!
"
said
his
aunt
,
as
she
stood
up
to
welcome
him
back
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
An
'
when
didst
ta
come
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
but
thy
uncle
will
be
glad
to
see
thee
,
and
to
hear
thee
talk
about
yon
pleughs
;
he
's
thought
a
deal
o
'
thy
letters
.
<EOS>
I
'll
go
call
him
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
yet
,
"
said
Philip
,
stopping
her
in
her
progress
towards
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
busy
talking
to
Kester
.
<EOS>
I
'm
in
no
haste
to
be
gone
.
<EOS>
I
can
stay
a
couple
of
hours
.
<EOS>
Sit
down
,
and
tell
me
how
you
are
yoursel
'
 
and
how
iverything
is
.
<EOS>
And
I
've
a
deal
to
tell
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
be
sure
 
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
To
think
thou
's
been
in
Lunnon
sin
'
I
saw
thee
!
 
<EOS>
well
to
be
sure
!
<EOS>
There
's
a
vast
o
'
coming
and
going
<EOS>
i
'
this
world
.
<EOS>
Thou'll
mind
yon
specksioneer
lad
<EOS>
,
him
as
was
cousin
to
t
'
Corneys
 
Charley
Kinraid
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mind
him
!
<EOS>
As
if
he
could
forget
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
he
's
dead
and
gone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dead
!
<EOS>
Who
told
you
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
understand
,
"
said
Philip
,
in
strange
bewilderment
.
<EOS>
Could
Kinraid
have
tried
to
escape
after
all
,
and
been
wounded
,
killed
in
the
attempt
?
<EOS>
If
not
,
how
should
they
know
he
was
dead
?
<EOS>
Missing
he
might
be
,
though
how
this
should
be
known
was
strange
,
as
he
was
supposed
to
be
sailing
to
the
Greenland
seas
.
<EOS>
But
dead
!
<EOS>
What
did
they
mean
?
<EOS>
At
Philip
's
worst
moment
of
hatred
he
had
hardly
dared
to
wish
him
dead
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dunnot
yo
'
mention
<EOS>
it
afore
our
Sylvie
;
we
niver
speak
on
him
to
her
,
for
she
takes
it
a
deal
to
heart
,
though
I
'm
thinkin
<EOS>
'
it
were
a
good
thing
for
her
;
for
he
'd
got
a
hold
of
her
 
<EOS>
he
had
on
Bessy
Corney
,
too
,
<EOS>
as
her
mother
telled
me
;
 
not
that
I
iver
let
on
to
them
as
Sylvia
frets
after
him
,
so
keep
a
calm
sough
,
my
lad
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
girl
's
fancy
 
just
a
kind
o
'
calf
-
love
;
let
it
go
by
;
and
it
's
well
for
her
<EOS>
he
's
dead
,
though
it
's
hard
to
say
so
on
a
drowned
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Drowned
!
"
said
Philip
.
<EOS>
"
How
do
yo
'
know
?
<EOS>
"
half
hoping
that
the
poor
drenched
swollen
body
might
have
been
found
,
and
thus
all
questions
and
dilemmas
solved
.
<EOS>
Kinraid
might
have
struggled
overboard
with
ropes
or
handcuffs
on
,
and
so
have
been
drowned
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
lad
!
<EOS>
there
's
no
misdoubtin
'
it
.
<EOS>
He
were
thought
a
deal
on
by
t
'
captain
o
'
t
'
_
Urania
_
;
and
when
he
niver
come
back
on
t
'
day
when
she
ought
for
to
have
sailed
,
he
sent
to
Kinraid
's
people
at
Cullercoats
,
and
they
sent
to
Brunton
's
i
'
Newcassel
,
and
they
knew
he
'd
been
here
.
<EOS>
T
'
captain
put
off
sailing
for
two
or
three
days
,
that
he
might
ha
'
that
much
law
;
but
when
he
heard
as
Kinraid
were
not
at
Corneys
'
,
but
had
left
'em
a'most
on
to
a
week
,
he
went
off
to
them
<EOS>
Northern
seas
wi
'
t
'
<EOS>
next
best
specksioneer
he
could
find
.
<EOS>
For
there
's
no
use
speaking
ill
on
t
'
dead
;
an
'
though
I
could
n't
abear
his
coming
for
iver
about
t
'
house
,
he
were
a
rare
good
specksioneer
,
as
I
've
been
told
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
how
do
you
know
he
was
drowned
?
"
said
Philip
,
feeling
guiltily
disappointed
at
his
aunt
's
story
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
lad
!
<EOS>
I
'm
a'most
ashamed
to
tell
thee
,
I
were
sore
put
out
mysel
'
;
but
Sylvia
were
so
broken
-
hearted
<EOS>
like
I
could
n't
cast
it
up
to
her
as
I
should
ha
'
liked
:
th
'
silly
lass
had
gone
and
gi'en
him
a
bit
o
'
ribbon
,
as
many
a
one
knowed
,
for
it
had
been
a
vast
noticed
and
admired
that
evenin
'
at
th
'
Corneys
'
 
new
year
's
eve
<EOS>
I
think
it
were
 
and
t
'
poor
vain
peacock
had
tied
it
on
his
hat
,
so
that
when
t
'
tide
   
hist
!
<EOS>
there
's
Sylvie
coming
in
at
t
'
back
-
door
;
never
let
on
,
"
and
in
a
forced
made
-
up
voice
she
inquired
aloud
,
for
hitherto
she
had
been
speaking
almost
in
a
whisper
,
    
"
And
didst
ta
see
King
George
an
'
Queen
Charlotte
?
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
could
not
answer
 
did
not
hear
.
<EOS>
His
soul
had
gone
out
to
meet
Sylvia
,
who
entered
with
quiet
slowness
quite
unlike
her
former
self
.
<EOS>
Her
face
was
wan
and
white
;
her
gray
eyes
seemed
larger
,
and
full
of
dumb
tearless
sorrow
;
she
came
up
to
Philip
,
as
if
his
being
there
touched
her
with
no
surprise
,
and
gave
him
a
gentle
greeting
as
if
he
were
a
familiar
indifferent
person
whom
she
had
seen
but
yesterday
.
<EOS>
Philip
,
who
had
recollected
the
quarrel
they
had
had
,
and
about
Kinraid
too
,
the
very
last
time
they
had
met
,
had
expected
some
trace
of
this
remembrance
to
linger
in
her
looks
and
speech
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
such
sign
;
her
great
sorrow
had
wiped
away
all
anger
,
almost
all
memory
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
looked
at
her
anxiously
,
and
then
said
in
the
same
manner
of
forced
cheerfulness
which
she
had
used
before
,
    
<EOS>
"
Here
's
Philip
,
lass
,
a
'
full
o
'
Lunnon
;
<EOS>
call
thy
father
in
,
an
<EOS>
we
'll
hear
a
'
about
t
'
new
-
fangled
pleughs
.
<EOS>
It
'll
be
rare
an
'
nice
a
'
sitting
together
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
,
silent
and
docile
,
went
out
to
the
shippen
to
obey
her
mother
's
wish
.
<EOS>
Bell
Robson
leant
forward
towards
Philip
,
misinterpreting
the
expression
on
his
face
,
which
was
guilt
as
much
as
sympathy
,
and
checked
the
possible
repentance
which
might
have
urged
him
on
at
that
moment
to
tell
all
he
knew
,
by
saying
,
"
Lad
!
<EOS>
it
's
a
'
for
t
'
best
.
<EOS>
He
were
noane
good
enough
for
her
;
and
I
misdoubt
me
he
were
only
playin
'
wi
'
her
as
he
'd
done
by
others
.
<EOS>
Let
her
a
-
be
,
let
her
a
-
be
;
she
'll
come
round
to
be
thankful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Robson
bustled
in
with
loud
welcome
;
all
the
louder
and
more
talkative
because
he
,
like
his
wife
,
assumed
a
cheerful
manner
before
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
Yet
he
,
unlike
his
wife
,
had
many
a
secret
regret
over
Kinraid
's
fate
.
<EOS>
At
first
,
while
merely
the
fact
of
his
disappearance
was
known
,
Daniel
Robson
had
hit
on
the
truth
,
and
had
stuck
to
his
opinion
that
the
cursed
press
-
gang
were
at
the
bottom
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
had
backed
his
words
by
many
an
oath
,
and
all
the
more
because
he
had
not
a
single
reason
to
give
that
applied
to
the
present
occasion
.
<EOS>
No
one
on
the
lonely
coast
had
remarked
any
sign
of
the
presence
of
the
men
-
of
-
war
,
or
the
tenders
that
accompanied
them
,
for
the
purpose
of
impressment
on
the
king
's
ships
.
<EOS>
At
Shields
,
and
at
the
mouth
of
the
Tyne
,
where
they
lay
in
greedy
wait
,
the
owners
of
the
_
Urania
_
had
caused
strict
search
to
be
made
for
their
skilled
and
protected
specksioneer
,
but
with
no
success
.
<EOS>
All
this
positive
evidence
in
contradiction
to
Daniel
Robson
's
opinion
only
made
him
cling
to
it
the
more
;
until
the
day
when
the
hat
was
found
on
the
shore
with
Kinraid
's
name
written
out
large
and
fair
in
the
inside
,
and
the
tell
-
tale
bit
of
ribbon
knotted
in
the
band
.
<EOS>
Then
Daniel
,
by
a
sudden
revulsion
,
gave
up
every
hope
;
it
never
entered
his
mind
that
it
could
have
fallen
off
by
any
accident
.
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
now
Kinraid
was
dead
and
drowned
,
and
it
was
a
bad
job
,
and
the
sooner
it
could
be
forgotten
the
better
for
all
parties
;
and
it
was
well
<EOS>
no
one
knew
how
far
it
had
gone
with
Sylvia
,
especially
now
since
Bessy
Corney
was
crying
her
eyes
out
as
if
he
had
been
engaged
to
her
.
<EOS>
So
Daniel
said
nothing
to
his
wife
about
the
mischief
that
had
gone
on
in
her
absence
,
and
never
spoke
to
Sylvia
about
the
affair
;
only
he
was
more
than
usually
tender
to
her
in
his
rough
way
,
and
thought
,
morning
,
noon
,
and
night
,
on
what
he
could
do
to
give
her
pleasure
,
and
drive
away
all
recollection
of
her
ill
-
starred
love
.
  
<EOS>
To
-
night
he
would
have
her
sit
by
him
while
Philip
told
his
stories
,
or
heavily
answered
questions
put
to
him
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
sat
on
a
stool
by
her
father
's
knee
,
holding
one
of
his
hands
in
both
of
hers
;
and
presently
she
laid
down
her
head
upon
them
,
and
Philip
saw
her
sad
eyes
looking
into
the
flickering
fire
-
light
with
long
unwinking
stare
,
showing
that
her
thoughts
were
far
distant
.
<EOS>
He
could
hardly
go
on
with
his
tales
of
what
he
had
seen
,
and
what
done
,
he
was
so
full
of
pity
for
her
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
for
all
his
pity
,
he
had
now
resolved
never
to
soothe
her
with
the
knowledge
of
what
he
knew
,
nor
to
deliver
the
message
sent
by
her
false
lover
.
<EOS>
He
felt
like
a
mother
withholding
something
injurious
from
the
foolish
wish
of
her
plaining
child
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
went
away
without
breathing
a
word
of
his
good
fortune
in
business
.
<EOS>
The
telling
of
such
kind
of
good
fortune
seemed
out
of
place
this
night
,
when
the
thought
of
death
and
the
loss
of
friends
seemed
to
brood
over
the
household
,
and
cast
its
shadow
there
,
obscuring
for
the
time
all
worldly
things
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
the
great
piece
of
news
came
out
in
the
ordinary
course
of
gossip
,
told
by
some
Monkshaven
friend
to
Robson
the
next
market
day
.
<EOS>
For
months
Philip
had
been
looking
forward
to
the
sensation
which
the
intelligence
would
produce
in
the
farm
household
,
as
a
preliminary
to
laying
his
good
fortune
at
Sylvia
's
feet
.
<EOS>
And
they
heard
of
it
,
and
he
away
,
and
all
chance
of
his
making
use
of
it
in
the
manner
he
had
intended
vanished
for
the
present
.
  
<EOS>
Daniel
was
always
curious
after
other
people
's
affairs
,
and
now
was
more
than
ever
bent
on
collecting
scraps
of
news
which
might
possibly
interest
Sylvia
,
and
rouse
her
out
of
the
state
of
indifference
as
to
everything
into
which
she
had
fallen
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
thought
that
he
had
not
acted
altogether
wisely
in
allowing
her
to
engage
herself
to
Kinraid
,
for
he
was
a
man
apt
to
judge
by
results
;
and
moreover
he
had
had
so
much
reason
to
repent
of
the
encouragement
which
he
had
given
to
the
lover
whose
untimely
end
had
so
deeply
affected
his
only
child
,
that
he
was
more
unwilling
than
ever
that
his
wife
should
know
of
the
length
to
which
the
affair
had
gone
during
her
absence
.
<EOS>
He
even
urged
secrecy
upon
Sylvia
as
a
personal
favour
;
unwilling
to
encounter
the
silent
blame
which
he
openly
affected
to
despise
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
'll
noane
fret
thy
mother
by
lettin
'
on
how
oft
he
came
and
went
.
<EOS>
She
'll

<EOS>
he
were
for
speakin
'
to
thee
,
my
poor
lass
;
an
'
it
would
put
her
out
a
deal
,
for
she
's
a
woman
of
a
stern
mind
towards
matteremony
.
<EOS>
And
she
'll
be
noane
so
strong
till
summer
-
weather
comes
,
and
I
'd
be
loath
to
give
her
aught
to
worrit
hersel
'
about
.
<EOS>
So
thee
and
me
'll
keep
our
own
counsel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
mother
had
been
here
,
then
she
'd
ha
'
known
all
,
without
my
telling
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Cheer
up
,
lass
;
it
's
better
as
it
is
.
<EOS>
Thou'll

o'er

<EOS>
A
myself

noane
going
to

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
No
more
he
did
;
but
there
was
a
strange
tenderness
in
his
tones
when
he
spoke
to
her
;
a
half
-
pathetic
way
of
seeking
after
her
,
if
by
any
chance
she
was
absent
for
a
minute
from
the
places
where
he
expected
to
find
her
;
a
consideration
for
her
,
about
this
time
,
in
his
way
of
bringing
back
trifling
presents
,
or
small
pieces
of
news
that
he
thought
might
interest
her
,
which
sank
deep
into
her
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
dun
yo
'
think
a
'
t
'
folks
is
talkin
'
on
i
'
Monkshaven
?
"
<EOS>
asked
he
,
almost
before
he
had
taken
off
his
coat
,
on
the
day
when
he
had
heard
of
Philip
's
promotion
in
the

Why

thy

has

<EOS>
"
That
's
t

secret
of
his
journey
t

said
Bell
,
more
gratified
than
she
chose
to
show
.
  
<EOS>
"
Four

<EOS>
I
heerd

at

but
I
thought
yo'd
niver
be

I
seed
it
wi

my

<EOS>
They
do
say
as

,
got
it
done
<EOS>
i

York
,
for
that
nought
else
would
satisfy

Jeremiah

<EOS>
It
'll
be
a
matter
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
some
hundreds
a

<EOS>
i

Philip
's
pocket

<EOS>

There
'll

may
say
,
to
take

said
Bell
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
that
's
<EOS>

as
it
should
be

for
I

"
said
he
,
turning
to
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
"
A'm
fain
to
tak
'
thee
in
to

bonny
ribbon
for
thy
hair
out
o
'
t
'
cousin
's
own
shop
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Some
thought
of
another
ribbon
which
had
once
tied
up
her
hair
,
and
afterwards
been
cut
in
twain
,
must
have
crossed
Sylvia
's
mind
,
for
she
answered
,
as
if
she
shrank
from
her
father
's
words
,
    
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
go
,
I
'm
noane
wantin

a
ribbon
;
I
'm
much
obliged

father
,
a
'
t
'
same

"
  
<EOS>
Her
mother
read
her
heart
clearly
,
and
suffered
with
her
,
but
never
spoke
a
word
of
sympathy
.
<EOS>
But
she
went
on
rather
more
quickly
than
she
would
otherwise
have
done
to
question
her
husband
as
to
all
he
knew
about
this
great
rise
of
Philip
's
.
<EOS>
Once
or
twice
Sylvia
joined
in
with
languid
curiosity
;
but
presently
she
became
tired
and
went
to
bed
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
moments
after
she
left
,
her
parents
sate
silent
.
<EOS>
Then
Daniel
,
in
a
tone
as
if
he
were
justifying
his
daughter
,
and
comforting
himself
as
well
as
his
wife
,
observed
that
it
was
almost
on
for
nine
<EOS>
;
the
evenings
were
light
so
long
now
.
<EOS>
Bell
said
nothing
in
reply
,
but
gathered
up
her
wool
,
and
began
to
arrange
the
things
for
night
.
  
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
Daniel
broke
the
silence
by
saying
,
    
"
A
thowt
at
one
time
as
Philip
had
a
fancy
for
our
Sylvie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
For
a
minute
or
two
Bell
did
not
speak
.
<EOS>
Then
,
with
deeper
insight
into
her
daughter
's
heart
than
her
husband
,
in
spite
of
his
greater
knowledge
of
the
events
that
had
happened
to
affect
it
,
she
said
,
    
"
If
thou
's
thinking
on
a
match
between
'em

it
'll
be
a
long
time

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
said
nought
about
sweethearts
,
"
replied
he
,
as
if
his
wife
had
reproached
him
in
some
way
.
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
A
only
said
as

had
a

a

so
still

and
he
'll

But
a

<EOS>
A
REJECTED
SUITOR
  
<EOS>
There
were
many
domestic
arrangements
to
be
made
in
connection
with
the
new
commercial
ones
which
affected
Hepburn
and
Coulson
.
  
<EOS>
The
Fosters
,
with
something
of
the
busybodiness
which
is
apt
to
mingle
itself
with
kindly
patronage
,
had
planned
in
their
own
minds
that
the
Rose
household
should
be
removed
altogether
to
the
house
belonging
to
the
shop
;
and
that
Alice
,
with
the
assistance
of
the
capable
servant
,
who
,
at
present
,
managed
all
John
's
domestic
affairs
,
should
continue
as
mistress
of
the
house
,
with
Philip
and
Coulson
for
her
lodgers
.
  
<EOS>
But
arrangements
without
her
consent
did
not
suit
Alice
at
any
time
,
and
she
had
very
good
reasons
for
declining
to
accede
to
this
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
going
to
be
uprooted
at
her
time
of
life
,
she
said
,
nor
would
she
consent
to
enter
upon
a
future
which
might
be
so
uncertain
.
<EOS>
Why
,
Hepburn
and
Coulson
were
both
young
men
,
she
said
,
and
they
were
as
likely
to
marry
as
not
;
and
then
the
bride
would
be
sure
to
wish
to
live
in
the
good
old
-
fashioned
house
at
the
back
of
the
shop
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
<EOS>
she
was
told
by
every
one
concerned
,
that
,
in
case
of
such
an
event
,
the
first
married
partner
should
take
a
house
of
his
own
,
leaving
her
in
undisputed
possession
.
<EOS>
She
replied
,
with
apparent
truth
,
that
both
might
wish
to
marry
,
and
surely
the
wife
of
one
ought
to
take
possession
of
the
house
belonging
to
the
business
;
that
she
was
not
going
to
trust
herself
to
the
fancies
of
young
men
,
who
were
always
,
the
best
of
them
,
going
and
doing
the
very
thing
that
was
most
foolish
in
the
way
of
marriage
;
of
which
state
,
in
fact
,
she
spoke
with
something
of
acrimonious
contempt
and
dislike
,
as
if
young
people
always
got
mismatched
,
yet
had
not
the
sense
to
let
older
and
wiser
people
choose
for
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thou'll
not
have
been
understanding
why
Alice
Rose
spoke
as
she
did
this
morning
,
"
said
Jeremiah
Foster
to
Philip
,
on
the
afternoon
succeeding
the
final
discussion
of
this
plan
.
<EOS>
"
She
was
a
-
thinking
of
her
youth
,
I
reckon
,
when
she
was
a
well
-
favoured
young
woman
,
and
our
John
was
full
of
the
thought
of
marrying
her
.
<EOS>
As
he
could
not
have
her
,
he
has
lived
a
bachelor
all
his
days
.
<EOS>
But
if
I
am
not
a
vast
mistaken
,
all
that
he
has
will
go
to
her
and
to
Hester
,
for
all
that
Hester
is
the
child
of
another
man
.
<EOS>
Thee
and
Coulson
should
have
a
try
for
Hester
,
Philip
.
<EOS>
I
have
told
Coulson
this
day
of
Hester
's
chances
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
first
because
he
is
my
wife
's
nephew
;
but
I
tell
thee
now
,
Philip
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
good
thing
for
the
shop
if
one
of
ye
was
married
.
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
reddened
.
<EOS>
Often
as
the
idea
of
marriage
had
come
into
his
mind
,
this
was
the
first
time
it
had
been
gravely
suggested
to
him
by
another
.
<EOS>
But
he
replied
quietly
enough
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
Hester
Rose
has
any
thought
of
matrimony
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
not
;
it
is
for
thee
,
or
for
William
Coulson
,
to
make
her
think
.
<EOS>
She
,
may
-
be
,
remembers
enough
of
her
mother
's
life
with
her
father
to
make
her
slow
to
think
on
such
things
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
in
her
to
think
on
matrimony
;
it
's
in
all
of
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
's
husband
was
dead
before
I
knew
her
,
"
said
Philip
,
rather
evading
the
main
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
mercy
when
he
were
taken
.
<EOS>
A
mercy
to
them
who
were
left
,
I
mean
.
<EOS>
Alice
was
a
bonny
young
woman
,
with
a
smile
for
everybody
,
when
he
we
d
her
 
<EOS>
a
smile
for
every
one
except
our
John
,
who
never
could
do
enough
to
try
and
win
one
from
her
.
<EOS>
But
,
no
!
<EOS>
she
would
have
none
of
him
,
but
set
her
heart
on
Jack
Rose
,
a
sailor
in
a
whale
-
ship
.
<EOS>
And
so
they
were
married
at
last
,
though
all
her
own
folks
were
against
it
.
<EOS>
And
he
was
a
profligate
sinner
,
and
went
after
other
women
,
and
drank
,
and
beat
her
.
<EOS>
She
turned
as
stiff
and
<EOS>
as
grey
as
thou
seest
her
now
within
a
year
of
Hester
's
birth
.
<EOS>
I
believe
they
'd
have
perished
for
want
and
cold
many
a
time
if
it
had
not
been
for
John
.
<EOS>
If
she
ever
guessed
where
the
money
came
from
,
it
must
have
hurt
her
pride
above
a
bit
,
for
she
was
always
a
proud
woman
.
<EOS>
But
mother
's
love
is
stronger
than
pride
.
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
fell
to
thinking
;
a
generation
ago
something
of
the
same
kind
had
been
going
on
as
that
which
he
was
now
living
through
,
quick
with
hopes
and
fears
.
<EOS>
A
girl
beloved
by
two
 
nay
,
those
two
so
identical
in
occupation
as
he
and
Kinraid
were
 
<EOS>
Rose
identical
even
in
character
with
what
he
knew
of
the
specksioneer
;
a
girl
choosing
the
wrong
lover
,
and
suffering
and
soured
all
her
life
in
consequence
of
her
youth
's
mistake
;
was
that
to
be
Sylvia
's
lot
?
 
<EOS>
or
,
rather
,
was
she
not
saved
from
it
by
the
event
of
the
impressment
,
and
by
the
course
of
silence
he
himself
had
resolved
upon
?
<EOS>
Then
he
went
on
to
wonder
if
the
lives
of
one
generation
were
but
a
repetition
of
the
lives
of
those
who
had
gone
before
,
with
no
variation
but
from
the
internal
cause
that
some
had
greater
capacity
for
suffering
than
others
.
<EOS>
Would
those
very
circumstances
which
made
the
interest
of
his
life
now
,
return
,
in
due
cycle
,
when
he
was
dead
and
Sylvia
was
forgotten
?
  
<EOS>
Perplexed
thoughts
of
this
and
a
similar
kind
kept
returning
into
Philip
's
mind
whenever
he
had
leisure
to
give
himself
up
to
consideration
of
anything
<EOS>
but
the
immediate
throng
of
business
.
<EOS>
And
every
time
he
dwelt
on
this
complication
and
succession
of
similar
events
,
he
emerged
from
his
reverie
more
and
more
satisfied
with
the
course
he
had
taken
in
withholding
from
Sylvia
all
knowledge
of
her
lover
's
fate
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
settled
at
length
that
Philip
was
to
remove
to
the
house
belonging
to
the
shop
,
Coulson
remaining
with
Alice
and
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
But
in
the
course
of
the
summer
the
latter
told
his
partner
that
he
had
offered
marriage
to
Hester
on
the
previous
day
,
and
been
refused
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
awkward
affair
altogether
,
as
he
lived
in
their
house
,
and
was
in
daily
companionship
with
Hester
,
who
,
however
,
seemed
to
preserve
her
gentle
calmness
,
with
only
a
tinge
more
of
reserve
in
her
manner
to
Coulson
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
yo
'
could
find
out
what
she
has
again
'
me
,
Philip
,
"
said
Coulson
,
about
a
fortnight
after
he
had
made
the
proposal
.
<EOS>
The
poor
young
man
thought
that
Hester
's
composure
of
manner
towards
him
since
the
event
argued
that
he
was
not
distasteful
to
her
;
and
as
he
was
now
on
very
happy
terms
with
Philip
,
he
came
constantly
to
him
,
as
if
the
latter
could
interpret
the
meaning
of
all
the
little
occurrences
between
him
and
his
beloved
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
o
'
right
age
,
not
two
months
betwixt
us
;
and
there
's
few
in
Monkshaven
as
would
think
on
her
wi
'
better
prospects
than
me
;
and
she
knows
my
folks
;
we
're
kind
o
'
cousins
,
in
fact
;
and
I
'd
be
like
a
son
to
her
mother
;
and
there
's
noane
<EOS>
i
'
Monkshaven
as
can
speak
again
'
my
character
.
<EOS>
There
's
nought
between
yo

and
her
,
is
there
,
Philip
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ha
'
telled
thee
many
a
time
that
she
and
me
is
like
brother
and
sister

<EOS>
She
's
no
more
thought
on
me
<EOS>
nor
I
have
for
her
.
<EOS>
So
be
content
wi't
,
for
I'se
not
tell
thee
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
vexed
,
Philip
;
if
thou
knew
what
it
was
to
be
in
love
,
thou'd
be
always
fancying
things
,
just
as
I
am
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
might
be
,
"
said
Philip
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
dunnut
think
I
should
be
always
talking
about
my
fancies
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
wunnot
talk
any
more
after
this
once
,
if
thou'll
just
find
out
fra
'
thysel
'
,
as
it
were
,
what
it
is
she
has
again
'
me
.
<EOS>
I
'd
go
to
chapel
for
iver
with
her
,
if
that
's
what
she
wants
.
<EOS>
Just
ask
her
,
Philip
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
an
awkward
thing
for
me
to
be
melling
wi
'
,
"
said
Hepburn
,
reluctantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
thou
said
thee
and
<EOS>
she
were
like
brother
and
sister
;
and
a
brother
would
ask
a
sister
,
and
niver
think
twice
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
"
replied
Philip
,
"
I
'll
see
what
I
can
do
;
but
,
lad
<EOS>
,
I
dunnot
think
she
'll
have
thee
.
<EOS>
She
does
n't
fancy
thee
,
and
fancy
is
three
parts
o
'
love
,
if
reason
is
t
'
other
fourth
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
somehow
Philip
could
not
begin
on
the
subject
with
Hester
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
know
why
,
except
that
,
as
he
said
,
"
it
was
so
awkward
.
"
<EOS>
But
he
really
liked
Coulson
so
much
as
to
be
anxious
to
do
what
the
latter
wished
,
although
he
was
almost
convinced
that
it
would
be
of
no
use
.
<EOS>
So
he
watched
his
opportunity
,
and
found
Alice
alone
and
at
leisure
one
Sunday
evening
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
sitting
by
the
window
,
reading
her
Bible
,
when
he
went
in
.
<EOS>
She
gave
him
a
curt
welcome
,
hearty
enough
for
her
,
for
she
was
always
chary
in
her
expressions
of
pleasure
or
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
But
she
took
off
her
horn
spectacles
and
placed
them
in
the
book
to
keep
her
place
;
and
then
turning
more
fully
round
on
her
chair
,
so
as
to
face
him
,
she
said
,
    
"
Well
,
lad
!
<EOS>
and
how
does
it
go
on
?
<EOS>
Though
it
's
not
a
day
for
t
'
ask
about
worldly
things
.
<EOS>
But
I
niver
see
thee
now
but
on
Sabbath
day
,
and
rarely
then
.
<EOS>
Still
we
munnot
speak
o
'
such
things
on
t
'
Lord
's
day
.
<EOS>
So
thee
mun
just
say
how
t
'
shop
is
doing
,
and
then
we
'll
leave
such
vain
talk
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
T
'
shop
is
doing
main
an
'
well
,
thank
ye
,
mother
.
<EOS>
But
Coulson
could
tell
yo
'
o
'
that
any
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'd
a
deal
rayther
hear
fra
'
thee
,
Philip
.
<EOS>
Coulson
does
n't
know
how
t
'
manage
his
own
business
,
let
alone
half
the
business
as
it
took
John
and
Jeremiah
's
heads
 
<EOS>
ay
,
and
tasked
'em
,
too
 
to
manage
.
<EOS>
I
've
no
patience
with
Coulson
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
<EOS>
he
's
a
decent
young
fellow
as
ever
there
is
in
Monkshaven
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
may
be
.
<EOS>
He
's
noane
cut
his
wisdom
-
teeth
yet
.
<EOS>
But
,
for
that
matter
,
there
's
other
folks
as
far
fra
'
sense
as
he
is
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ay
,
and
farther
.
<EOS>
Coulson
may
n't
be
so
bright
at
all
times
as
he
might
be
,
but
he
's
a
steady
-
goer
,
and
I
'd
back
him
again
'
<EOS>
any
chap
o
'
his
age
i
'
Monkshaven
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
who
I
'd
sooner
back
in
many
a
thing
,
Philip
!
"
<EOS>
She
said
it
with
so
much
meaning
that
he
could
not
fail
to
understand
that
he
himself
was
meant
,
and
he
replied
,
ingenuously
enough
,
    
"
<EOS>
If
yo
'
mean
me
,
mother
,
I
'll
noane
deny
that
in
a
thing
or
two
I
may
be
more
knowledgeable
than
Coulson
.
<EOS>
I
've
had
a
deal
o
'
time
on
my
hands
<EOS>
i
'
my
youth
,
and
<EOS>
I
'd
good
schooling
as
long
as
father
lived
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lad
!
<EOS>
it
's
not
schooling
,
nor
knowledge
,
nor
book
-
learning
as
carries
a
man
through
t
'
world
.
<EOS>
It
's
mother
-
wit
.
<EOS>
And
it
's
noane
schooling
,
nor
knowledge
,
nor
book
-
learning
as
takes
a
young
woman
.
<EOS>
It
's
summat
as
can
not
be
put
into
words
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
just
what
I
told
Coulson
!
"
said
Philip
,
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
He
were
sore
put
about
because
Hester
had
gi'en
him
the
bucket
,
and
came
to
me
about
it
.
"
  
"
And
what
did
thou
say
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Alice
,
her
deep
eyes
gleaming
at
him
as
if
to
read
his
face
as
well
as
his
words
.
<EOS>
Philip
,
thinking
he
could
now
do
what
Coulson
had
begged
of
him
in
the
neatest
manner
,
went
on
,
    
<EOS>
"
I
told
him
I
'd
help
him
all
as
I
could
   
'
  
"
Thou
did
,
did
thou
?
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
there
's
nought
sa
queer
as
folks
,
that
a
will
say
,
"
muttered
Alice
,
between
her
teeth
.
  
<EOS>
'
 
<EOS>
but
that
fancy
had
three
parts
to
do
<EOS>
wi
'
love
,
"
continued
Philip
,
"
and
it
would
be
hard
,
may
-
be
,
to
get
a
reason
for
her
not
fancying
him
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
wish
she
'd
think
twice
about
it
;
he
so
set
upon
having
her
<EOS>
,
I
think
he
'll
do
himself
a
mischief
wi
'
fretting
,
if
it
goes
on
as
it
is
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
'll
noane
go
on
as
it
is
,
"
said
Alice
,
with
gloomy
oracularness
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
not
?
"
asked
Philip
.
<EOS>
Then
,
receiving
no
answer
,
he
went
on
,
"
He
loves
her
true
,
and
he
's
within
a
month
or
two
on
her
age
,
and
his
character
will
bear
handling
on
a
'
sides
;
and
his
share
on
t
'
shop
will
be
worth
hundreds
a
year
afore
long
.
"
  
<EOS>
Another
pause
.
<EOS>
Alice
was
trying
to
bring
down
her
pride
to
say
something
,
which
she
could
not
with
all
her
efforts
.
  
<EOS>
"
Maybe
yo'll
speak
a
word
for
him
,
mother
,
"
said
Philip
,
annoyed
at
her
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
do
no
such
thing
.
<EOS>
Marriages
are
best
made
wi'out
melling
.
<EOS>
How
do
I
know
but
what
she
likes
some
one
better
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Our
Hester
's
not
th
'
lass
to
think
on
a
young
man
unless
he
's
been
a
-
wooing
on
her
.
<EOS>
And
yo
'
know
,
mother
,
<EOS>
as
well
as
I
do
 
and
Coulson
does
too
 
<EOS>
she
's
niver
<EOS>
given
any
one
a
chance
to
woo
her
;
living
half
her
time
here
,
and
t
'
other
half
in
t
'
shop
,
and
niver
speaking
to
no
one
by
t
'
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
thou
would
n't
come
here
troubling
me
on
a
Sabbath
day
wi
'
thy
vanity
and
thy
worldly
talk
.
<EOS>
I
'd
liefer
by
far
<EOS>
be
i
'
<EOS>
that
world
<EOS>
wheere
there
's
neither
marrying
nor
giving
in
marriage
,
for
it
's
all
a
moithering
mess
here
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
turned
to
the
closed
Bible
lying
on
the
dresser
,
and
opened
it
with
a
bang
.
<EOS>
While
she
was
adjusting
her
spectacles
on
her
nose
,
with
hands
trembling
with
passion
,
she
heard
Philip
say
,
    
"
I
ask
yo'r
pardon
,
I
'm
sure
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
well
come
any
other
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
'
t
'
<EOS>
same
 
<EOS>
I
care
not
.
<EOS>
But
thou
might
as
well
tell
truth
.
<EOS>
I
'll
be
bound
<EOS>
thou
's
been
at
Haytersbank
Farm
some
day
this
week
?
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
reddened
;
in
fact
,
he
had
forgotten
how
he
had
got
to
consider
his
frequent
visits
to
the
farm
as
a
regular
piece
of
occupation
.
<EOS>
He
kept
silence
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
looked
at
him
with
a
sharp
intelligence
that
read
his
silence
through
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
so
.
<EOS>
Next
time
thou
thinks
to
thyself
,
"
I
'm
more
knowledgeable
than
Coulson
,
"
just
remember
Alice
Rose
's
words
,
and
they
are
these
:
 
If
Coulson
's
too
thick
-
sighted
to
see
through
a
board
,
thou'rt
too
blind
to
see
through
a
window
.
<EOS>
As
for
comin
'
and
speakin
'
up
for
Coulson
,
why
he
'll
be
married
to
some
one
else
afore
t
'
year
's
out
,
for
all
he
thinks
he
's
so
set
upon
Hester
now
.
<EOS>
Go
thy
ways
,
and
leave
me
to
my
Scripture
,
and
come
no
more
on
Sabbath
days
wi
'
thy
vain
babbling
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
Philip
returned
from
his
mission
rather
crestfallen
,
but
quite
as
far
as
ever
from
"
seeing
through
a
glass
window
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Before
the
year
was
out
,
Alice
's
prophecy
was
fulfilled
.
<EOS>
Coulson
,
who
found
the
position
of
a
rejected
lover
in
the
same
house
with
the
girl
who
had
refused
him
,
too
uncomfortable
to
be
endured
,
as
soon
as
he
was
convinced
that
his
object
was
decidedly
out
of
his
reach
,
turned
his
attention
to
some
one
else
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
love
his
new
sweetheart
as
he
had
done
Hester
:
there
was
more
of
reason
and
less
of
fancy
in
his
attachment
.
<EOS>
But
it
ended
successfully
;
and
before
the
first
snow
fell
,
Philip
was
best
man
at
his
partner
's
wedding
.
    
<EOS>
DEEPENING
SHADOWS
  
<EOS>
But
before
Coulson
was
married
,
many
small
events
happened
 
small
events
to
all
but
Philip
.
<EOS>
To
him
they
were
as
the
sun
and
moon
.
<EOS>
The
days
when
he
went
up
to
Haytersbank
and
Sylvia
spoke
to
him
,
the
days
when
he
went
up
<EOS>
and
she
had
apparently
no
heart
to
speak
to
any
one
,
but
left
the
room
as
soon
as
he
came
,
or
never
entered
it
at
all
,
although
she
must
have
known
that
he
was
there
 
<EOS>
these
were
his
alternations
from
happiness
to
sorrow
.
  
<EOS>
From
her
parents
he
always
had
a
welcome
.
<EOS>
Oppressed
by
their
daughter
's
depression
of
spirits
,
they
hailed
the
coming
of
any
visitor
as
a
change
for
her
as
well
as
for
themselves
.
<EOS>
The
former
intimacy
with
the
Corneys
was
in
abeyance
for
all
parties
,
owing
to
Bessy
Corney
's
out
-
spoken
grief
for
the
loss
of
her
cousin
,
as
if
she
had
had
reason
to
look
upon
him
as
her
lover
,
whereas
Sylvia
's
parents
felt
this
as
a
slur
upon
their
daughter
's
cause
of
grief
.
<EOS>
But
although
at
this
time
the
members
of
the
two
families
ceased
to
seek
after
each
other
's
society
,
nothing
was
said
.
<EOS>
The
thread
of
friendship
might
be
joined
afresh
at
any
time
,
only
just
now
it
was
broken
;
and
Philip
was
glad
of
it
.
<EOS>
Before
going
to
Haytersbank
he
sought
each
time
for
some
little
present
with
which
to
make
his
coming
welcome
.
<EOS>
And
now
he
wished
even
more
than
ever
that
Sylvia
had
cared
for
learning
;
if
she
had
he
could
have
taken
her
many
a
pretty
ballad
,
or
story
-
book
,
<EOS>
such
as
were
then
in
vogue
.
<EOS>
He
did
try
her
with
the
translation
of
the
_
Sorrows
of
Werther
_
,
so
popular
at
the
time
that
it
had
a
place
in
all
pedlars
'
baskets
,
with
Law
's
_
<EOS>
Serious
Call
_
,
the
_
Pilgrim
's
Progress
_
,
Klopstock
's
_
Messiah
_
,
and
_
Paradise
Lost
_
.
<EOS>
But
she
could
not
read
it
for
herself
;
and
after
turning
the
leaves
languidly
over
,
and
smiling
a
little
at
the
picture
of
Charlotte
cutting
bread
and
butter
in
a
left
-
handed
manner
,
she
put
it
aside
on
the
shelf
by
the
_
Complete
Farrier
_
;
and
there
Philip
saw
it
,
upside
down
and
untouched
,
the
next
time
he
came
to
the
farm
.
  
<EOS>
Many
a
time
during
that
summer
did
he
turn
to
the
few
verses
in
Genesis
in
which
Jacob
's
twice
seven
years
'
service
for
Rachel
is
related
,
and
try
and
take
fresh
heart
from
the
reward
which
came
to
the
patriarch
's
constancy
at
last
.
<EOS>
After
trying
books
,
nosegays
,
small
presents
of
pretty
articles
of
dress
,
such
as
suited
the
notions
of
those
days
,
and
finding
them
all
received
with
the
same
languid
gratitude
,
he
set
himself
to
endeavour
to
please
her
in
some
other
way
.
<EOS>
It
was
time
that
he
should
change
his
tactics
;
for
the
girl
was
becoming
weary
of
the
necessity
for
thanking
him
,
every
time
he
came
,
for
some
little
favour
or
other
.
<EOS>
She
wished
he
would
let
her
alone
and
not
watch
her
continually
with
such
sad
eyes
.
<EOS>
Her
father
and
mother
hailed
her
first
signs
of
impatient
petulance
towards
him
as
a
return
to
the
old
state
of
things
before
Kinraid
had
come
to
disturb
the
tenour
of
their
lives
;
for
even
Daniel
had
turned
against
the
specksioneer
,
irritated
by
the
Corneys
'
loud
moans
over
the
loss
of
the
man
to
whom
their
daughter
said
that
she
was
attached
.
<EOS>
If
Daniel
wished
for
him
to
be
alive
again
,
it
was
mainly
that
the
Corneys
might
be
convinced
that
his
last
visit
to
the
neighbourhood
of
Monkshaven
was
for
the
sake
of
the
pale
and
silent
Sylvia
,
and
not
for
that
of
Bessy
,
who
complained
of
Kinraid
's
untimely
death
rather
as
if
by
it
she
had
been
cheated
of
a
husband
than
for
any
overwhelming
personal
love
towards
the
deceased
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
he
were
after
her
he
were
a
big
black
scoundrel
,
that
's
what
he
were
;
and
a
wish
he
were
alive
again
to
be
hung
.
<EOS>
But
a
dunnot
believe
it
;
them
Corney
lasses
were
allays
a
-
talkin
'
an
'
a
-
thinking
on
sweethearts
,
and
niver
a
man
crossed
t
'
threshold
<EOS>
but
they
tried
him
on
as
a
husband
.
<EOS>
An
'
their
mother
were
no
better
:
Kinraid
has
spoken
civil
to
Bessy
as
became
a
lad
to
a
lass
,
and
she
makes
an
ado
over
him
as
if
they
'd
been
to
church
together
not
a
week
sin
'
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dunnot
uphold
t
'
Corneys
;
but
Molly
Corney
 
<EOS>
as
is
Molly
Brunton
now
 
used
to
speak
on
this
dead
man
to
our
Sylvie
as
if
he
were
her
sweetheart
in
old
days
.
<EOS>
Now
there
's
no
smoke
without
fire
,
and
I
'm
thinking
it
's
likely
enough
he
were
<EOS>
one
of
them
fellows
as
is
always
after
some
lass
or
another
,
and
,
as
often
as
not
,
two
or
three
at
a
time
.
<EOS>
Now
look
at
Philip
,
what
a
different
one
he
is
!
<EOS>
He
's
niver
<EOS>
thought
on
a
woman
but
our
Sylvie
,
I
'll
be
bound
.
<EOS>
I
wish
he
wern't
<EOS>
so
old
-
fashioned
and
faint
-
hearted
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
<EOS>
and
t
'
shop
's
doin'
a
vast
o
'
business
<EOS>
,
I
've
heard
say
.
<EOS>
He
's
a
deal
better
company
,
too
,
"
<EOS>
n
<EOS>
or
he
used
to
be
.
<EOS>
He
'd

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Such
was
a
conjugal
colloquy
about
this
time
.
<EOS>
Philip
was
gaining
ground
with
Daniel
,
and
that
was
something
towards
winning
Sylvia
's
heart
;
for
she
was
unaware
of
her
father
's
change
of
feeling
towards
Kinraid
,
and
took
all
his
tenderness
towards
herself
as
if
they
were
marks
of
his
regard
for
her
lost
lover
and
his
sympathy
in
her
loss
,
instead
of
which
he
was
rather
feeling
as
if
it
might
be
a
good
thing
after
all
that
the
fickle
-
hearted
sailor
was
dead
and
drowned
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
Daniel
was
very
like
a
child
in
all
the
parts
of
his
character
.
<EOS>
He
was
strongly
affected
by
whatever
was
present
,
and
apt
to
forget
the
absent
.
<EOS>
He
acted
on
impulse
,
and
too
often
had
reason
to
be
sorry
for
it
;
but
he
hated
his
sorrow
too
much
to
let
it
teach
him
wisdom
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
With
all
his
many
faults
,
however
,
he
had
something
in
him
which
made
him
be
dearly
loved
,
both
by
the
daughter
whom
he
indulged
,
and
the
wife
who
was
in
fact
superior
to
him
,
but
whom
he
imagined
that
he
ruled
with
a
wise
and
absolute
sway
.
  
<EOS>
Love
to
Sylvia
gave
Philip
tact
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
find
out
that
to
please
the
women
of
the
household
he
must
pay
all
possible
attention
to
the
man
;
and
though
he
cared
little
in
comparison
for
Daniel
,
yet
this
autumn
he
was
continually
thinking
of
how
he
could
please
him
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
said
or
done
anything
to
gratify
or
amuse
her
father
,
Sylvia
smiled
and
was
kind
.
<EOS>
Whatever
he
did
was
right
with
his
aunt
;
but
even
she
was
unusually
glad
when
her
husband
was
pleased
.
<EOS>
Still
his
progress
was
slow
towards
his
object
;
and
often
he
sighed
himself
to
sleep
with
the
words
,
"
seven
years
,
and
maybe
seven
years
more
"
.
<EOS>
Then
in
his
dreams
he
saw
Kinraid
again
,
sometimes
struggling
,
sometimes
sailing
towards
land
,
<EOS>
the
only
one
on
board
a
swift
advancing
ship
,
alone
on
deck
,
stern
and
avenging
;
till
Philip
awoke
in
remorseful
terror
.
  
<EOS>
Such
and
similar
dreams
returned
with
the
greater
frequency
when
,
in
the
November
of
that
year
,
the
coast
between
Hartlepool
and
Monkshaven
was
overshadowed
by
the
presence
of
guard
-
ships
,
driven
south
from
their
station
at
North
Shields
by
the
resolution
which
the
sailors
of
that
port
had
entered
into
to
resist
the
press
-
gang
,
and
the
energy
with
which
they
had
begun
to
carry
out
their
determination
.
<EOS>
For
on
a
certain
Tuesday
evening
yet
remembered
by
old
inhabitants
of
North
Shields
,
the
sailors
in
the
merchant
service
met
together
and
overpowered
the
press
-
gang
,
dismissing
them
from
the
town
with
the
highest
contempt
,
and
with
their
jackets
reversed
.
<EOS>
A
numerous
mob
went
with
them
to
Chirton
Bar
;
gave
them
three
cheers
at
parting
,
but
vowed
to
tear
them
limb
from
limb
<EOS>
should
they
seek
to
re
-
enter
North
Shields
.
<EOS>
But
a
few
days
afterwards
some
fresh
cause
of
irritation
arose
,
and
five
hundred
sailors
,
armed
with
such
swords
and
pistols
as
they
could
collect
,
paraded
through
the
town
in
the
most
riotous
manner
,
and
at
last
attempted
to
seize
the
tender
Eleanor
,
on
some
pretext
of
the
ill
-
treatment
of
the
impressed
men
aboard
.
<EOS>
This
endeavour
failed
,
however
,
owing
to
the
energetic
conduct
of
the
officers
in
command
.
<EOS>
Next
day
this
body
of
sailors
set
off
for
Newcastle
;
but
learning
,
before
they
reached
the
town
,
that
there
was
a
strong
military
and
civil
force
prepared
to
receive
them
there
,
they
dispersed
for
the
time
;
but
not
before
the
good
citizens
had
received
a
great
fright
,
the
drums
of
the
North
Yorkshire
militia
beating
to
arms
,
and
the
terrified
people
rushing
out
into
the
streets
to
learn
the
reason
of
the
alarm
,
and
some
of
them
seeing
the
militia
,
under
the
command
of
the
Earl
of
Fauconberg
,
marching
from
the
guard
-
house
adjoining
New
Gate
to
the
house
of
rendezvous
for
impressed
seamen
in
the
Broad
Chase
.
  
<EOS>
But
a
few
weeks
after
,
the
impressment
service
took
their
revenge
for
the
insults
they
had
been
subjected
to
in
North
Shields
.
<EOS>
In
the
dead
of
night
a
cordon
was
formed
round
that
town
by
a
regiment
stationed
at
Tynemouth
barracks
;
the
press
-
gangs
belonging
to
armed
vessels
lying
off
Shields
harbour
were
let
loose
;
no
one
within
the
circle
could
escape
,
and
upwards
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
men
,
sailors
,
mechanics
,
labourers
of
every
description
,
were
forced
on
board
the
armed
ships
.
<EOS>
With
that
prize
they
set
sail
,
and
wisely
left
the
place
,
where
deep
passionate
vengeance
was
sworn
against
them
.
<EOS>
Not
all
the
dread
of
an
invasion
by
the
French
could
reconcile
the
people
of
these
coasts
to
the
necessity
of
impressment
.
<EOS>
Fear
and
confusion
prevailed
after
this
to
within
many
miles
of
the
sea
-
shore
.
<EOS>
A
Yorkshire
gentleman
of
rank
said
that
his
labourers
dispersed
like
a
covey
of
birds
,
because
a
press
-
gang
was
reported
to
have
established
itself
so
far
inland
as
Tadcaster
;
and
they
only
returned
to
work
on
the
assurance
from
the
steward
of
his
master
's
protection
,
but
even
then
begged
leave
to
sleep
on
straw
in
the
stables
or
outhouses
belonging
to
their
landlord
,
not
daring
to
sleep
at
their
own
homes
.
<EOS>
No
fish
was
caught
,
for
the
fishermen
dared
not
venture
out
to
sea
;
the
markets
were
deserted
,
as
the
press
-
gangs
might
come
down
on
any
gathering
of
men
;
prices
were
raised
,
and
many
were
impoverished
;
many
others
ruined
.
<EOS>
For
in
the
great
struggle
in
which
England
was
then
involved
,
the
navy
was
esteemed
her
safeguard
;
and
men
must
be
had
at
any
price
of
money
,
or
suffering
,
or
of
injustice
.
<EOS>
Landsmen
were
kidnapped
and
taken
to
London
;
there
,
in
too
many
instances
,
to
be
discharged
without
redress
and
penniless
,
because
they
were
discovered
to
be
useless
for
the
purpose
for
which
they
had
been
taken
.
  
<EOS>
Autumn
brought
back
the
whaling
-
ships
.
<EOS>
But
the
period
of
their
return
was
full
of
gloomy
anxiety
,
instead
of
its
being
the
annual
time
of
rejoicing
and
feasting
;
of
gladdened
households
,
where
brave
steady
husbands
or
sons
returned
;
of
unlimited
and
reckless
expenditure
,
and
boisterous
joviality
among
those
who
thought
that
they
had
earned
unbounded
licence
on
shore
by
their
six
months
of
compelled
abstinence
.
<EOS>
In
other
years
this
had
been
the
time
for
new
and
handsome
winter
clothing
;
for
cheerful
if
humble
hospitality
;
for
the
shopkeepers
to
display
their
gayest
and
best
;
for
the
public
-
houses
to
be
crowded
;
for
the
streets
to
be
full
of
blue
jackets
,
rolling
along
with
merry
words
and
open
hearts
.
<EOS>
In
other
years
the
boiling
-
houses
had
been
full
of
active
workers
,
the
staithes
crowded
with
barrels
,
the
ship
-
carpenters
'
yards
thronged
with
seamen
and
captains
;
now
a
few
men
,
tempted
by
high
wages
,
went
stealthily
by
back
lanes
to
their
work
,
clustering
together
,
with
sinister
looks
,
glancing
round
corners
,
and
fearful
of
every
approaching
footstep
,
as
if
they
were
going
on
some
unlawful
business
,
instead
of
true
honest
work
.
<EOS>
Most
of
them
kept
their
whaling
-
knives
about
them
ready
for
bloody
defence
if
they
were
attacked
.
<EOS>
The
shops
were
almost
deserted
;
there
was
no
unnecessary
expenditure
by
the
men
;
they
dared
not
venture
out
to
buy
lavish
presents
for
the
wife
or
sweetheart
or
little
children
.
<EOS>
The
public
-
houses
kept
scouts
on
the
look
-
out
;
while
fierce
men
drank
and
swore
deep
oaths
of
vengeance
in
the
bar
 
men
who
did
not
maunder
in
their
cups
,
nor
grow
foolishly
merry
,
but
in
whom
liquor
called
forth
all
the
desperate
,
bad
passions
of
human
nature
.
  
<EOS>
Indeed
,
all
along
the
coast
of
Yorkshire
,
it
seemed
as
if
a
blight
hung
over
the
land
and
the
people
.
<EOS>
Men
dodged
about
their
daily
business
with
hatred
and
suspicion
in
their
eyes
,
and
many
a
curse
went
over
the
sea
to
the
three
fatal
ships
lying
motionless
at
anchor
three
miles
off
Monkshaven
.
<EOS>
When
first
Philip
had
heard
in
his
shop
that
these
three
men
-
of
-
war
might
be
seen
lying
fell
and
still
on
the
gray
horizon
,
his
heart
sank
,
and
he
scarcely
dared
to
ask
their
names
.
<EOS>
For
if
one
should
be
the
_
Alcestis
_
;
if
Kinraid
should
send
word
to
Sylvia
;
if
he
should
say
he
was
living
,
and
loving
,
and
faithful
;
if
it
should
come
to
pass
that
the
fact
of
the
undelivered
message
sent
by
her
lover
through
Philip
should
reach
Sylvia
's
ears
:
what
would
be
the
position
of
the
latter
,
not
merely
in
her
love
 
<EOS>
that
,
of
course
,
would
be
hopeless
 
but
in
her
esteem
?
<EOS>
All
sophistry
vanished
;
the
fear
of
detection
awakened
Philip
to
a
sense
of
guilt
;
and
,
besides
,
he
found
out
,
that
,
in
spite
of
all
idle
talk
and
careless
slander
,
he
could
not
help
believing
that
Kinraid
was
in
terrible
earnest
when
he
uttered
those
passionate
words
,
and
entreated
that
they
might
be
borne
to
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
Some
instinct
told
Philip
that
if
the
specksioneer
had
only
flirted
with
too
many
,
yet
that
for
Sylvia
Robson
his
love
was
true
and
vehement
.
<EOS>
Then
Philip
tried
to
convince
himself
that
,
from
all
that
was
said
of
his
previous
character
,
Kinraid
was
not
capable
of
an
enduring
constant
attachment
;
and
with
such
poor
opiate
to
his
conscience
as
he
could
obtain
from
this
notion
Philip
was
obliged
to
remain
content
,
until
,
a
day
or
two
after
the
first
intelligence
of
the
presence
of
those
three
ships
,
he
learned
,
with
some
trouble
and
pains
,
that
their
names
were
the
_
Megoera
_
,
the
_
Bellerophon
_
,
and
the
_
Hanover
_
.
  
<EOS>
Then
he
began
to
perceive
how
unlikely
it
was
that
the
_
Alcestis
_
should
have
been
lingering
on
this
shore
all
these
many
months
.
<EOS>
She
was
,
doubtless
,
gone
far
away
by
this
time
<EOS>
;
she
had
,
probably
,
joined
the
fleet
on
the
war
station
.
<EOS>
Who
could
tell
what
had
become
of
her
and
her
crew
?
<EOS>
she
might
have
been
in
battle
before
now
,
and
if
so
      
<EOS>
So
his
previous
fancies
shrank
to
nothing
,
rebuked
for
their
improbability
,
and
with
them
vanished
his
self
-
reproach
.
<EOS>
Yet
there
were
times
when
the
popular
attention
seemed
totally
absorbed
by
the
dread
of
the
press
-
gang
;
when
no
other
subject
was
talked
about
 
hardly
,
in
fact
,
thought
about
.
<EOS>
At
such
flows
of
panic
,
Philip
had
his
own
private
fears
lest
a
flash
of
light
should
come
upon
Sylvia
,
and
she
should
suddenly
see
that
Kinraid
's
absence
might
be
accounted
for
in
another
way
besides
death
.
<EOS>
But
when
he
reasoned
,
this
seemed
unlikely
.
<EOS>
No
man
-
of
-
war
had
been
seen
off
the
coast
,
or
,
if
seen
,
had
never
been
spoken
about
,
at
the
time
of
Kinraid
's
disappearance
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
vanished
this
winter
time
,
every
one
would
have
been
convinced
that
the
press
-
gang
had
seized
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Philip
had
never
heard
any
one
breathe
the
dreaded
name
of
the
_
Alcestis
_
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
he
went
on
to
think
,
at
the
farm
they
are
out
of
hearing
of
this
one
great
weary
subject
of
talk
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
so
,
as
he
became
convinced
one
evening
.
<EOS>
His
aunt
caught
him
a
little
aside
while
Sylvia
was
in
the
dairy
,
and
her
husband
talking
in
the
shippen
with
Kester
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
good
's
sake
,
Philip
,
dunnot
thee
bring
us
talk
about
t
'
press
-
gang
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
thing
as
has
got
hold
on
my
measter
,
till
thou'd
think
him
possessed
.
<EOS>
He
's
speaking
perpetual
on
it
<EOS>
i
'
<EOS>
such
a
way
,
that
thou'd
think
he
were
itching
to
kill
'em
a
'
afore
he
tasted
bread
again
.
<EOS>
He
really
trembles
wi
'
rage
and
passion
;
an
'
a
'
night
it
's
just
as
bad
.
<EOS>
He
starts
up
i
'
his
sleep
,
swearing
and
cursing
at
'em
,
till
I
'm
sometimes
afeard
he
'll
mak
'
<EOS>
an
end
o
'
me
by
mistake
.
<EOS>
And
what
mun
he
do
last
night
but
open
out
on
Charley
Kinraid
,
and
tell
Sylvie
he
thought
m'appen
t
'
gang
had
got
hold
on
him
.
<EOS>
It
might
make
her
cry
a
'
her
saut
tears
o'er
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
spoke
,
by
no
wish
of
his
own
,
but
as
if
compelled
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
An
'
who
knows
but
what
it
's
true
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
instant
these
words
had
come
out
of
his
lips
he
could
have
bitten
his
tongue
off
.
<EOS>
And
yet
afterwards
it
was
a
sort
of
balm
to
his
conscience
that
he
had
so
spoken
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
nonsense
,
Philip
!
"
said
his
aunt
;
"
why
,
these
fearsome
ships
were
far
out
o
'
sight
when
he
went
away
,
good
go
wi
'
him
,
and
Sylvie
just
getting
o'er
<EOS>
her
trouble
so
nicely
,
and
even
my
master
went
on
for
to
say
if
they
'd
getten
hold
on
him
,
he
were
not
a
chap
to
stay
wi
'
'em
;
he
'd
gi'en
proofs
on
his
hatred
to
'em
,
time
on
.
<EOS>
He
either
ha
'
made
off
 
an
'
then
sure
enough
we
should
ha
'
heerd
on
him
<EOS>
somehow
 
them
Corneys
is
full
on
him
still
and
they
've
a
deal
to
wi
'
his
folk
beyond
Newcassel
 
<EOS>
or
,
as
my
master
says
,
he
were
just
t
'
chap
to
hang
or
drown
hissel
,
sooner
nor
do
aught
against
his
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
Sylvie
say
?
"
asked
Philip
,

<EOS>
why
,
a

she
could
say
was
to
burst
out
crying
,
and
after
a
bit
,
she
just
repeated
her
feyther
's
words
,
and
said
anyhow
he
was
dead
,
for
he
'd
niver
live
to
go

a

gang

<EOS>
She
knowed
him
too
well
for
that
.
<EOS>
Thou
sees
she
thinks
a
deal
on
him
for
a
spirited
chap
,
as
can
do
what
he
will
.
<EOS>
I
belie

<EOS>

<EOS>
she
first
began
to

on
him
time
o

Good
Fortune

,
when
Darley
were
killed
,
and

would
seem
tame
-
like
to
her
if
he
could
n't
conquer
press
-
gangs
,
and
men
-
o
'
 
war
.
<EOS>
She
's
sooner

on
him

,
as
she
's
ne'er

him
again

<EOS>
"
It
's
best
so
,
"
said
Philip
,
and
then
,
to
calm
his
unusually
excited
aunt
,
he
promised
to
avoid
the
subject
of
the
press
-
gang
as
much
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
But
it
was
a
promise
very
difficult
of
performance
,
for
Daniel
Robson
was
,
as
his
wife
said
,
like
one
possessed
.
<EOS>
He
could
hardly
think
of
anything
else
,
though
he
himself
was
occasionally
weary
of
the
same
constantly
recurring
idea
,
and
would
fain
have
banished
it
from
his
mind
.
<EOS>
He
was
too
old
a
man
to
be
likely
to
be
taken
by
them
;
he
had
no
son
to
become
their
victim
;
but
the
terror
of
them
,
which
he
had
braved
and
defied
in
his
youth
,
seemed
to
come
back
and
take
possession
of
him
in
his
age
;
and
with
the
terror
came
impatient
hatred
.
<EOS>
Since
his
wife
's
illness
the
previous
winter
he
had
been
a
more
sober
man
until
now
.
<EOS>
He
was
never
exactly
drunk
,
for
he
had
a
strong
,
well
-
seasoned
head
;
but
the
craving
to
hear
the
last
news
of
the
actions
of
the
press
-
gang
drew
him
into
Monkshaven
nearly
every
day
at
this
dead
agricultural
season
of
the
year
;
and
a
public
-
house
is
generally
the
focus
from
which
gossip
radiates
;
and
probably
the
amount
of
drink
thus
consumed
weakened
Robson
's
power
over
his
mind
,
and
caused
the
concentration
of
thought
on
one
subject
.
<EOS>
This
may
be
a
physiological
explanation
of
what
afterwards
was
spoken
of
as
a
supernatural
kind
of
possession
,
leading
him
to
his
doom
.
    
<EOS>
RETALIATION
  
<EOS>
The
public
-
house
that
had
been
chosen
by
the
leaders
of
the
press
-
gang
in
Monkshaven
at
this
time
,
for
their
rendezvous
(
or
"
Randyvowse
"
,
as
it
was
generally
pronounced
)
,
was
an
inn
of
poor
repute
,
with
a
yard
at
the
back
which
opened
on
to
the
staithe
or
quay
nearest
to
the
open
sea
.
<EOS>
A
strong
high
stone
wall
bounded
this
grass
-
grown
mouldy
yard
on
two
sides
;
the
house
,
and
some
unused
out
-
buildings
,
formed
the
other
two
.
<EOS>
The
choice
of
the
place
was
good
enough
,
both
as
to
situation
,
which
was
sufficiently
isolated
,
and
yet
near
to
the
widening
river
;
and
as
to
the
character
of
the
landlord
,
John
Hobbs
was
a
failing
man
,
one
who
seemed
as
if
doomed
to
be
unfortunate
in
all
his
undertakings
,
and
<EOS>
the
consequence
of
all
this
was
that
he
was
envious
of
the
more
prosperous
,
and
willing
to
do
anything
that
might
bring
him
in
a
little
present
success
in
life
.
<EOS>
His
household
consisted
of
his
wife
,
her
niece
,
who
acted
as
servant
,
and
an
out
-
of
-
doors
man
,
a
brother
of
Ned
Simpson
,
the
well
-
doing
butcher
,
who
at
one
time
had
had
a
fancy
for
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
But
the
one
brother
was
prosperous
,
the
other
had
gone
on
sinking
in
life
,
like
him
who
was
now
his
master
.
<EOS>
Neither
Hobbs
nor
his
man
Simpson
were
absolutely
bad
men
;
if
things
had
gone
well
with
them
they
might
each
have
been
as
scrupulous
and
conscientious
as
their
neighbours
,
and
even
now
,
supposing
the
gain
in
money
to
be
equal
,
they
would
sooner
have
done
good
than
evil
;
but
a
very
small
sum
was
enough
to
turn
the
balance
.
<EOS>
And
in
a
greater
degree
than
in
most
cases
was
the
famous
maxim
of
Rochefoucault
true
with
them
;
for
in
the
misfortunes
of
their
friends
they
seemed
to
see
some
justification
of
their
own
.
<EOS>
It
was
blind
fate
dealing
out
events
,
not
that
the
events
themselves
were
the
inevitable
consequences
of
folly
or
misconduct
.
<EOS>
To
such
men
as
these
the
large
sum
offered
by
the
lieutenant
of
the
press
-
gang
for
the
accommodation
of
the
Mariners
'
Arms
was
simply
and
immediately
irresistible
.
<EOS>
The
best
room
in
the
dilapidated
house
was
put
at
the
service
of
the
commanding
officer
of
the
impress
service
,
and
all
other
arrangements
made
at
his
desire
,
irrespective
of
all
the
former
unprofitable
sources
of
custom
and
of
business
.
<EOS>
If
the
relatives
both
of
Hobbs
and
of
Simpson
had
not
been
so
well
known
and
so
prosperous
in
the
town
,
they
themselves
would
have
received
more
marks
of
popular
ill
opinion
than
they
did
during
the
winter
the
events
of
which
are
now
being
recorded
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
people
spoke
to
them
when
they
appeared
at
kirk
or
at
market
,
but
held
no
conversation
with
them
;
no
,
not
although
they
each
appeared
better
dressed
than
they
had
either
of
them
done
for
years
past
,
and
although
their
whole
manner
showed
a
change
,
inasmuch
as
they
had
been
formerly
snarling
and
misanthropic
,
and
were
now
civil
almost
to
deprecation
.
  
<EOS>
Every
one
who
was
capable
of
understanding
the
state
of
feeling
in
Monkshaven
at
this
time
must
have
been
aware
that
at
any
moment
an
explosion
might
take
place
;
and
probably
there
were
those
who
had
judgment
enough
to
be
surprised
that
it
did
not
take
place
sooner
than
it
did
.
<EOS>
For
until
February
there
were
only
occasional
cries
and
growls
of
rage
,
as
the
press
-
gang
made
their
captures
first
here
,
then
there
;
often
,
apparently
,
tranquil
for
days
,
then
heard
of
at
some
distance
along
the
coast
,
then
carrying
off
a
seaman
from
the
very
heart
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
They
seemed
afraid
of
provoking
any
general
hostility
,
such
as
that
which
had
driven
them
from
Shields
,
and
would
have
conciliated
the
inhabitants
if
they
could
;
the
officers
on
the
service
and
on
board
the
three
men
-
of
-
war
coming
often
into
the
town
,
spending
largely
,
talking
to
all
with
cheery
friendliness
,
and
making
themselves
very
popular
in
such
society
as
they
could
obtain
access
to
at
the
houses
of
the
neighbouring
magistrates
or
at
the
rectory
.
<EOS>
But
this
,
however
agreeable
,
did
not
forward
the
object
the
impress
service
had
in
view
;
and
,
accordingly
,
a
more
decided
step
was
taken
at
a
time
when
,
although
there
was
no
apparent
evidence
as
to
the
fact
,
the
town
was
full
of
the
Greenland
mariners
coming
quietly
in
to
renew
their
yearly
engagements
,
which
,
when
done
,
would
legally
entitle
them
to
protection
from
impressment
.
<EOS>
One
night
 
it
was
on
a
Saturday
,
February
23rd
,
when
there
was
a
bitter
black
frost
,
with
a
north
-
east
wind
sweeping
through
the
streets
,
and
men
and
women
were
close
shut
in
their
houses
 
<EOS>
all
were
startled
in
their
household
content
and
warmth
by
the
sound
of
the
fire
-
bell
busily
swinging
,
and
pealing
out
for
help
.
<EOS>
The
fire
-
bell
was
kept
in
the
market
-
house
where
High
Street
and
Bridge
Street
met
:
every
one
knew
what
it
meant
.
<EOS>
Some
dwelling
,
or
maybe
a
boiling
-
house
was
on
fire
,
and
neighbourly
assistance
was
summoned
with
all
speed
,
in
a
town
where
no
water
was
laid
on
,
nor
fire
-
engines
kept
in
readiness
.
<EOS>
Men
snatched
up
their
hats
,
and
rushed
out
,
wives
following
,
some
with
the
readiest
wraps
they
could
lay
hands
on
,
with
which
to
clothe
the
over
-
hasty
husbands
,
others
from
that
mixture
of
dread
and
curiosity
which
draws
people
to
the
scene
of
any
disaster
.
<EOS>
Those
of
the
market
people
who
were
making
the
best
of
their
way
homewards
,
having
waited
in
the
town
till
the
early
darkness
concealed
their
path
,
turned
back
at
the
sound
of
the
ever
-
clanging
fire
-
bell
,
ringing
out
faster
and
faster
as
if
the
danger
became
every
instant
more
pressing
.
  
<EOS>
As
men
ran
against
or
alongside
of
each
other
,
their
breathless
question
was
ever
,
"
Where
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
and
no
one
could
tell
;
so
they
pressed
onwards
into
the
market
-
place
,
sure
of
obtaining
the
information
desired
there
,
where
the
fire
-
bell
kept
calling
out
with
its
furious
metal
tongue
.
  
<EOS>
The
dull
oil
-
lamps
in
the
adjoining
streets
only
made
darkness
visible
in
the
thronged
market
-
place
,
where
the
buzz
of
many
men
's
unanswered
questions
was
rising
louder
and
louder
.
<EOS>
A
strange
feeling
of
dread
crept
over
those
nearest
to
the
closed
market
-
house
.
<EOS>
Above
them
in
the
air
the
bell
was
still
clanging
;
but
before
them
was
a
door
fast
shut
and
locked
;
no
one
to
speak
and
tell
them
why
they
were
summoned
 
where
they
ought
to
be
.
<EOS>
They
were
at
the
heart
of
the
mystery
,
and
it
was
a
silent
blank
!
<EOS>
Their
unformed
dread
took
shape
at
the
cry
from
the
outside
of
the
crowd
,
from
where
men
were
still
coming
down
the
eastern
side
of
Bridge
Street
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
gang
!
<EOS>
the
gang
!
<EOS>
"
shrieked
out
some
one
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
gang
are
upon
us
!
<EOS>
Help
!
<EOS>
help
!
"
<EOS>
Then
the
fire
-
bell
had
been
a
decoy
;
a
sort
of
seething
the
kid
in
its
mother
's
milk
,
leading
men
into
a
snare
through
their
kindliest
feelings
.
<EOS>
Some
dull
sense
of
this
added
to
utter
dismay
,
and
made
them
struggle
and
strain
to
get
to
all
the
outlets
save
that
in
which
a
fight
was
now
going
on
;
the
swish
of
heavy
whips
,
the
thud
of
bludgeons
,
the
groans
,
the
growls
of
wounded
or
infuriated
men
,
coming
with
terrible
distinctness
through
the
darkness
to
the
quickened
ear
of
fear
.
  
<EOS>
A
breathless
group
rushed
up
the
blackness
of
a
narrow
entry
to
stand
still
awhile
,
and
recover
strength
for
fresh
running
.
<EOS>
For
a
time
nothing
but
heavy
pants
and
gasps
were
heard
amongst
them
.
<EOS>
No
one
knew
his
neighbour
,
and
their
good
feeling
,
so
lately
abused
and
preyed
upon
,
made
them
full
of
suspicion
.
<EOS>
The
first
who
spoke
was
recognized
by
his
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
thee
,
Daniel
Robson
?
"
asked
his
neighbour
,
in
a
low
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay

<EOS>
Who
else
should

be

"
  
<EOS>
"
A

<EOS>

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
A

said
Daniel
,
recovering
his
breath
,
but
speaking
in
gasps
.
<EOS>
"
We

another

Daniel
went
on

spoke
out
a
fresh
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
What

"
replied
he
who
had
latest
come
,
and
who
stood
at
the
mouth
of
the
entry
.
<EOS>
"

said
the
last
speaker
but
one
.
  
<EOS>
Daniel
Robson
spoke
out
the
thought
that
was
surging
up
into
the
brain
of
every
one
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
There

<EOS>
By
dint
of
touching

the

were
counted

But

Before
Daniel
had
finished
speaking
,
those
nearest
to
the
entrance
muttered
their
assent
to
his
project
,
and
had
stolen
off
,
keeping
to
the
darkest
side
of
the
streets
and
lanes
,
which
they
threaded
in
different
directions
;
most
of
them
going
straight
as
sleuth
-
hounds
to
the
haunts
of
the
wildest
and
most
desperate
portion
of
the
seafaring
population
of
Monkshaven
.
<EOS>
For
,
in
the
breasts
of
many
,
revenge
for
the
misery
and
alarm
of
the
past
winter
took
a
deeper
and
more
ferocious
form
than
Daniel
had
thought
of
when
he
made
his
proposal
of
a
rescue
.
<EOS>
To
him
it
was
an
adventure
like
many
he
had
been
engaged
in
in
his
younger
days
;
indeed
,
the
liquor
he
had
drunk
had
given
him
a
fictitious
youth
for
the
time
;
and
it
was
more
in
the
light
of
a
rough
frolic
of
which
he
was
to
be
the
leader
,
that
he
limped
along
(
always
lame
from
old
attacks
of
rheumatism
)
,
chuckling
to
himself
at
the
apparent
stillness
of
the
town
,
which
gave
no
warning
to
the
press
-
gang
at
the
Rendezvous
of
anything
in
the
wind
.
<EOS>
Daniel
,
too
,
had
his
friends
to
summon
;
old
hands
like
himself
,
but
"
deep
uns
"
,
also
,
like
himself
,
as
he
imagined
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
nine
o'clock
when
all
who
were
summoned
met
at
the
church
steps
;
and
by
nine
o'clock
,
Monkshaven
,
in
those
days
,
was
more
quiet
and
asleep
than
<EOS>
many
a
town
at
present
is
at
midnight
.
<EOS>
The
church
and
churchyard
above
them
were
flooded
with
silver
light
,
for
the
moon
<EOS>
was
high
in
the
heavens
:
the
irregular
steps
were
here
and
there
in
pure
white
clearness
,
here
and
there
in
blackest
shadow
.
<EOS>
But
more
than
half
way
up
to
the
top
,
men
clustered
like
bees
;
all
pressing
so
as
to
be
near
enough
to
question
those
who
stood
nearest
to
the
planning
of
the
attack
.
<EOS>
Here
and
there
,
a
woman
,
with
wild
gestures
and
shrill
voice
,
that
no
entreaty
would
hush
down
to
the
whispered
pitch
of
the
men
,
pushed
her
way
through
the
crowd
 
this
one
imploring
immediate
action
,
that
adjuring
those
around
her
to
smite
and
spare
not
those
who
had
carried
off
her
"
man
"
,
 
the
father
,
the
breadwinner
.
<EOS>
Low
down
in
the
darkened
silent
town
were
many
whose
hearts
went
with
the
angry
and
excited
crowd
,
and
who
would
bless
them
and
caress
them
for
that
night
's
deeds
.
<EOS>
Daniel
soon
found
himself
a
laggard
in
planning
,
compared
to
some
of
those
around
him
.
<EOS>
But
when
,
with
the
rushing
sound
of
many
steps
and
but
few
words
,
they
had
arrived
at
the
blank
,
dark
,
shut
-
up
Mariners
'
Arms
,
they
paused
in
surprise
at
the
uninhabited
look
of
the
whole
house
:
it
was
Daniel
once
more
who
took
the
lead
.
  
<EOS>
"
Speak
'em
fair
,
"
said
he
;
"
try
good
words
first
.
<EOS>
Hobbs
'll
mebbe
let
'em
out
quiet
,
if
we
can
catch
a
word
wi
'
him
.
<EOS>
A
say
,
Hobbs
,
"
said
he
,
raising
his
voice
,
"
is
a
'
shut
up
for
t
'
neet
;
for
a'd
be
glad
of
a
glass
.
<EOS>
A'm
Dannel
Robson
,
thou
knows
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Not
one
word
in
reply
,
any
more
than
from
the
tomb
;
but
his
speech
had
been
heard
nevertheless
.
<EOS>
The
crowd
behind
him
began
to
jeer
and
to
threaten
;
there
was
no
longer
any
keeping
down
their
voices
,
their
rage
,
their
terrible
oaths
.
<EOS>
If
doors
and
windows
had
not
of
late
been
strengthened
with
bars
of
iron
in
anticipation
of
some
such
occasion
<EOS>
,
they
would
have
been
broken
in
with
the
onset
of
the
fierce
and
now
yelling
crowd
who
rushed
against
them
with
the
force
of
a
battering
-
ram
,
to
recoil
in
baffled
rage
from
the
vain
assault
.
<EOS>
No
sign
,
no
sound
from
within
,
in
that
breathless
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
away
round
here
!
<EOS>
a've
found
a
way
to
t
'
back
o
'
behint
,
where
belike
it
's
not
so
well
fenced
,
"
said
Daniel
,
who
had
made
way
for
younger
and
more
powerful
men
to
conduct
the
assault
,
and
had
employed
his
time
meanwhile
in
examining
the
back
premises
.
<EOS>
The
men
rushed
after
him
,
almost
knocking
him
down
,
as
he
made
his
way
into
the
lane
into
which
the
doors
of
the
outbuildings
belonging
to
the
inn
opened
.
<EOS>
Daniel
had
already
broken
the
fastening
of
that
which
opened
into
a
damp
,
mouldy
-
smelling
shippen
,
in
one
corner
of
which
a
poor
lean
cow
shifted
herself
on
her
legs
,
in
an
uneasy
,
restless
manner
,
as
her
sleeping
-
place
was
invaded
by
as
many
men
as
could
cram
themselves
into
the
dark
hold
.
<EOS>
Daniel
,
at
the
end
farthest
from
the
door
,
was
almost
smothered
before
he
could
break
down
the
rotten
wooden
shutter
,
that
,
when
opened
,
displayed
the
weedy
yard
of
the
old
inn
,
the
full
clear
light
defining
the
outline
of
each
blade
of
grass
by
the
delicate
black
shadow
behind
.
  
<EOS>
This
hole
,
used
to
give
air
and
light
to
what
had
once
been
a
stable
,
in
the
days
when
horse
travellers
were
in
the
habit
of
coming
to
the
Mariners
'
Arms
,
was
large
enough
to
admit
the
passage
of
a
man
;
and
Daniel
,
in
virtue
of
its
discovery
,
was
the
first
to
get
through
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
larger
and
heavier
than
he
had
been
;
his
lameness
made
him
less
agile
,
and
the
impatient
crowd
behind
him
gave
him
a
helping
push
that
sent
him
down
on
the
round
stones
with
which
the
yard
was
paved
,
and
for
the
time
disabled
him
so
much
that
he
could
only
just
crawl
out
of
the
way
of
leaping
feet
and
heavy
nailed
boots
,
which
came
through
the
opening
till
the
yard
was
filled
with
men
,
who
now
set
up
a
fierce
,
derisive
shout
,
which
,
to
their
delight
,
was
answered
from
within
.
<EOS>
No
more
silence
,
no
more
dead
opposition
:
a
living
struggle
,
a
glowing
,
raging
fight
;
and
Daniel
thought
he
should
be
obliged
to
sit
there
still
,
leaning
against
the
wall
,
inactive
,
while
the
strife
and
the
action
were
going
on
in
which
he
had
once
been
foremost
.
  
<EOS>
He
saw
the
stones
torn
up
;
he
saw
them
used
with
good
effect
on
the
unguarded
back
-
door
;
he
cried
out
in
useless
warning
as
he
saw
the
upper
windows
open
,
and
aim
taken
among
the
crowd
;
but
just
then
the
door
gave
way
,
and
there
was
an
involuntary
forward
motion
in
the
throng
,
so
that
no
one
was
so
disabled
by
the
shots
as
to
prevent
his
forcing
his
way
in
with
the
rest
.
<EOS>
And
now
the
sounds
came
veiled
by
the
walls
as
of
some
raging
ravening
beast
growling
over
his
prey
;
the
noise
came
and
went
 
once
utterly
ceased
;
and
Daniel
raised
himself
with
difficulty
to
ascertain
the
cause
,
when
again
the
roar
came
clear
and
fresh
,
and
men
poured
into
the
yard
again
,
shouting
and
rejoicing
over
the
rescued
victims
of
the
press
-
gang
.
<EOS>
Daniel
hobbled
up
,
and
shouted
,
and
rejoiced
,
and
shook
hands
with
the
rest
,
hardly
caring
to
understand
that
the
lieutenant
and
his
gang
had
quitted
the
house
by
a
front
window
,
and
that
all
had
poured
out
in
search
of
them
;
the
greater
part
,
however
,
returning
to
liberate
the
prisoners
,
and
then
glut
their
vengeance
on
the
house
and
its
contents
.
  
<EOS>
From
all
the
windows
,
upper
and
lower
,
furniture
was
now
being
thrown
into
the
yard
.
<EOS>
The
smash
of
glass
,
the
heavier
crash
of
wood
,
the
cries
,
the
laughter
,
the
oaths
,
all
excited
Daniel
to
the
utmost
;
<EOS>
and
,
forgetting
his
bruises
,
he
pressed
forwards
to
lend
a
helping
hand
.
<EOS>
The
wild
,
rough
success
of
his
scheme
almost
turned
his
head
.
<EOS>
He
hurraed
at
every
flagrant
piece
of
destruction
;
he
shook
hands
with
every
one
around
him
,
and
,
at
last
,
<EOS>
when
the
destroyers
inside
paused
to
take
breath
,
he
cried
out
,
    
"
If
a
was
as
young
as
onest
a
was
,
a'd
have
t
'
Randyvowse
down
,
and
mak
'
a
bonfire
on
it
.
<EOS>
We
'd
ring
t
'
fire
-
bell
then
t
'
some
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
No
sooner
said
than
done
.
<EOS>
Their
excitement
was
ready
to
take
the
slightest
hint
of
mischief
;
old
chairs
,
broken
tables
,
odd
drawers
,
smashed
chests
,
were
rapidly
and
skilfully
heaped
into
a
pyramid
,
and
one
,
who
at
the
first
broaching
of
the
idea
had
gone
for
live
coals
the
speedier
to
light
up
the
fire
,
came
now
through
the
crowd
with
a
large
shovelful
of
red
-
hot
cinders
.
<EOS>
The
rioters
stopped
to
take
breath
and
look
on
like
children
at
the
uncertain
flickering
blaze
,
which
sprang
high
one
moment
,
and
dropped
down
the
next
only
to
creep
along
the
base
of
the
heap
of
wreck
,
and
make
secure
of
its
future
work
.
<EOS>
Then
the
lurid
blaze
darted
up
wild
,
high
,
and
irrepressible
;
and
the
men
around
gave
a
cry
of
fierce
exultation
,
and
in
rough
mirth
began
to
try
and
push
each
other
in
.
<EOS>
In
one
of
the
pauses
of
the
rushing
,
roaring
noise
of
the
flames
,
the
moaning
low
and
groan
of
the
poor
alarmed
cow
fastened
up
in
the
shippen
caught
Daniel
's
ear
,
and
he
understood
her
groans
as
well
as
if
they
had
been
words
.
<EOS>
He
limped
out
of
the
yard
through
the
now
deserted
house
,
where
men
were
busy
at
the
mad
work
of
destruction
,
and
found
his
way
back
to
the
lane
into
which
the
shippen
opened
.
<EOS>
The
cow
was
dancing
about
at
the
roar
,
and
dazzle
,
and
heat
of
the
fire
;
but
Daniel
knew
how
to
soothe
her
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
had
a
rope
round
her
neck
,
and
led
her
gently
out
from
the
scene
of
her
alarm
.
<EOS>
He
was
still
in
the
lane
when
Simpson
,
the
man
-
of
-
all
-
work
at
the
Mariners
'
Arms
,
crept
out
of
some
hiding
-
place
in
the
deserted
outbuilding
,
and
stood
suddenly
face
to
face
with
Robson
.
  
<EOS>
The
man
was
white
with
fear
and
rage
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
,
tak
'
thy
beast
,
and
lead
her
wheere
she
'll
noane

gasped
out
Simpson
:
"
I
niver

and
now
I
'm
a
beggar
.
<EOS>
"
  
"

"
Simpson
was
now
fairly
crying
.
<EOS>
But
Daniel
did
not
realize
what
the
loss
of
all
the
small
property
he
had
in
the
world
was
to
the
poor
fellow
<EOS>
(
rapscallion
though
he
was
,
broken
down
,
unprosperous
ne'er

)
<EOS>
in
his
pride
at
the
good
work
he
believed
he
had
set
on
foot
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay

said
he
;
"

Daniel
was
not
in
the
habit
of
feeling
any
emotion
at
actions
not
directly
affecting
himself
;
or
else
he
might
have
despised
the
poor
wretch
who
immediately
clutched
at
the
money
,
and
overwhelmed
that
man
with
slobbery
thanks
whom
he
had
not
a
minute
before
been
cursing
.
<EOS>
But
all
Simpson
's
stronger
passions
had
been
long
ago
used
up
;
now
he
only
faintly
liked
and
disliked
,
where
once
he
loved
and
hated
;
his
only
vehement
feeling
was
for
himself
;
that
cared
for
,
other
men
might
wither
or
flourish
as
best
suited
them
.
  
<EOS>
Many
of
the
doors
which
had
been
close
shut
when
the
crowd
went
down
the
High
Street
,
were
partially
open
as
Daniel
slowly
returned
;
and
light
streamed
from
them
on
the
otherwise
dark
road
.
<EOS>
The
news
of
the
successful
attempt
at
rescue
had
reached
those
who
had
sate
in
mourning
and
in
desolation
an
hour
or
two
ago
,
and
several
of
these
pressed
forwards
as
from
their
watching
corner
they
recognized
Daniel
's
approach
;
they
pressed
forward
into
the
street
to
shake
him
by
the
hand
,
to
thank
him
(
for
his
name
had
been
bruited
abroad
as
one
of
those
who
had
planned
the
affair
)
,
and
at
several
places
he
was
urged
to
have
a
dram
 
urgency
that
he
was
loath
for
many
reasons
to
refuse
,
but
his
increasing
uneasiness
and
pain
made
him
for
once
abstinent
,
and
only
anxious
to
get
home
and
rest
.
<EOS>
But
he
could
not
help
being
both
touched
and
flattered
at
the
way
in
which
those
who
formed
his
"
world
"
looked
upon
him
as
a
hero
;
and
was
not
insensible
to
the
words
of
blessing
which
a
wife
,
whose
husband
had
been
impressed
and
rescued
this
night
,
poured
down
upon
him
as
he
passed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Theere
,
theere
,
 
dunnot
crack
thy
throat
wi
'
blessin
'
.
<EOS>
Thy
man
would
ha
'
done
as
much
for
me
,
though
mebbe
he
might
n't
ha
'
shown
so
much
gumption
and
capability
;
but
them
's
gifts
,
and
not
to
be
proud
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
When
Daniel
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
on
the
road
home
,
he
turned
to
look
round
;
but
he
was
lame
and
bruised
,
he
had
gone
along
slowly
,
the
fire
had
pretty
nearly
died
out
,
only
a
red
hue
in
the
air
about
the
houses
at
the
end
of
the
long
High
Street
,
and
a
hot
lurid
mist
against
the
hill
-
side
beyond
where
the
Mariners
'
Arms
had
stood
,
were
still
left
as
signs
and
token
of
the
deed
of
violence
.
  
<EOS>
Daniel
looked
and
chuckled
.
<EOS>
"
That
comes

"
said
he
to
himself
;
"

BRIEF
REJOICING
  
<EOS>
Daniel
's
unusually
late
absence
from
home
disturbed
Bell
and
Sylvia
not
a
little
.
<EOS>
He
was
generally
at
home
between
eight
and
nine
on
market
days
.
<EOS>
They
expected
to
see
him
the
worse
for
liquor
at
such
times
;
but
this
did
not
shock
them
;
he
was
no
worse
than
most
of
his
neighbours
,
indeed
better
than
several
,
who
went
off
once
or
twice
a
year
,
or
even
oftener
,
on
drinking
bouts
of
two
or
three
days
'
duration
,
returning
pale
,
sodden
,
and
somewhat
shame
-
faced
,
when
all
their
money
was
gone
;
and
,
after
the
conjugal
reception
was
well
over
,
settling
down
into
hard
-
working
and
decently
sober
men
until
the
temptation
again
got
power
over
them
.
<EOS>
But
,
on
market
days
,
every
man
drank
more
than
usual
;
every
bargain
or
agreement
was
ratified
by
drink
;
they
came
from
greater
or
less
distances
,
either
afoot
or
on
horseback
,
and
the
"
good
accommodation
for
man
and
beast
"
(
as
the
old
inn
-
signs
expressed
it
)
<EOS>
always
included
a
considerable
amount
of
liquor
to
be
drunk
by
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
Daniel
's
way
of
announcing
his
intention
of
drinking
more
than
ordinary
was
always
the
same
.
<EOS>
He
would
say
at
the
last
moment
,
"
Missus
,
I
've
a
mind
to
get
fuddled
to
-
neet
,
"
and
be
off
,
disregarding
her
look
of
remonstrance
,
and
little
heeding
the
injunctions
she
would
call
after
him
to
beware
of
such
and
such
companions
,
or
to
attend
to
his
footsteps
on
his
road
home
.
  
<EOS>
But
this
night
he
had
given
no
such
warning
.
<EOS>
Bell
and
Sylvia
put
the
candle
on
the
low
window
-
seat
at
the
usual
hour
to
guide
him
through
the
fields
 
<EOS>
it
was
a
habit
kept
up
even
on
moonlight
nights
like
this
 
and
sate
on
each
side
of
the
fire
,
at
first
scarcely
caring
to
listen
,
<EOS>
so
secure
were
they
of
his
return
.
<EOS>
Bell
dozed
,
and
Sylvia
sate
gazing
at
the
fire
with
abstracted
eyes
,
thinking
of
the
past
year
and
of
the
anniversary
which
was
approaching
of
the
day
when
she
had
last
seen
the
lover
whom
she
believed
to
be
dead
,
lying
somewhere
fathoms
deep
beneath
the
surface
of
that
sunny
sea
on
which
she
looked
day
by
day
without
ever
seeing
his
upturned
face
through
the
depths
,
with
whatsoever
heart
-
sick
longing
for
just
one
more
sight
she
yearned
and
inwardly
cried
.
<EOS>
If
she
could
set
her
eyes
on
his
bright
,
handsome
face
,
that
face
which
was
fading
from
her
memory
,
overtasked
in
the
too
frequent
efforts
to
recall
it
;
if
she
could
but
see
him
once
again
,
coming
over
the
waters
beneath
which
he
lay
with
supernatural
motion
,
awaiting
her
at
the
stile
,
with
the
evening
sun
shining
ruddy
into
his
bonny
eyes
,
even
though
,
after
that
one
instant
of
vivid
and
visible
life
,
he
faded
into
mist
;
if
she
could
but
see
him
now
,
sitting
in
the
faintly
flickering
fire
-
light
in
the
old
,
happy
,
careless
way
,
on
a
corner
of
the
dresser
,
his
legs
dangling
,
his
busy
fingers
playing
with
some
of
her
woman
's
work
;
 
<EOS>
she
wrung
her
hands
tight
together
as
she
implored
some
,
any
Power
,
to
let
her
see
him
just
once
again
 
just
once
 
for
one
minute
of
passionate
delight
.
<EOS>
Never
again
would
she
forget
that
dear
face
,
if
but
once
more
she
might
set
her
eyes
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
Her
mother
's
head
fell
with
a
sudden
jerk
,
and
she
roused
herself
up
;
and
Sylvia
put
by
her
thought
of
the
dead
,
and
her
craving
after
his
presence
,
into
that
receptacle
of
her
heart
where
all
such
are
kept
closed
and
sacred
from
the
light
of
common
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
Feyther
's
late
,
"
said
Bell
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
gone
eight
,
"
replied
Sylvia
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
our
clock
is
better
nor
an
hour
forrard
,
"
answered
Bell
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
but
t
'
wind
brings
Monkshaven
bells
clear
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
I
heerd
t
'
eight
o'clock
bell
ringing
not
five
minutes
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
fire
-
bell
,
but
she
had
not
distinguished
the
sound
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
another
long
silence
;
both
wide
awake
this
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
'll
have
his
rheumatics
again
,
"
said
Bell
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
cold
for
sartin
,
"
said
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
March
weather
come
afore
its
time
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
make
him
a
treacle
-
posset
,
it
's
a
famous
thing
for
keeping
off
hoasts
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
treacle
-
posset
was
entertainment
enough
for
both
while
it
was
being
made
.
<EOS>
But
once
placed
in
a
little
basin
in
the
oven
,
there
was
again
time
for
wonder
and
anxiety
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
said
nought
about
having
a
bout
,
did
he
,
mother
?
"
asked
Sylvia
at
length
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Bell
,
her
face
a
little
contracting
.
<EOS>
After
a
while
she
added
,
"
There
's
many
a
one
as
has
husbands
that
goes
off
drinking
without
iver
saying
a
word
to
their
wives

<EOS>
My

none
<EOS>
o

.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
"
broke
in
Sylvia
again
,
"
I
'll
just
go
and
get
t
'
lantern
out
of
t
'
shippen
,
and
go
up
t

,
and
mebbe
to

ash

<EOS>
"
  
"
Do

"
said
her
mother
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
get
my
wraps
and
go
with
thee
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thou
shall
do
niver
such
a
thing
,
"
said
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
"
Thou
's
too
frail
to
go
out
<EOS>
i
'
t
'
night
air
<EOS>
such
a
night
as
this

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
call
Kester
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not

<EOS>
I
'm

"
  
"
<EOS>
But
of
what
thou
mayst
meet
i
'
t
'
dark
,
lass
?
"
  
Sylvia
shivered
all
over
at
the
sudden
thought
,
suggested
by
this
speech
of
her
mother
's
,
that
the
idea
that
had
flashed
into
her
own
mind
of
going
to
look
for
her
father
might
be
an
answer
to
the
invocation
to
the
Powers
which
she
had
made
not
long
ago
,
that
she
might
indeed
meet
her
dead
lover
at
the
ash
-
field
stile
;
but
though
she
shivered
as
this
superstitious
fancy
came
into
her
head
,
her
heart
beat
firm
and
regular
;
not
from
darkness
nor
from
the
spirits
of
the
dead
was
she
going
to
shrink
;
her
great
sorrow
had
taken
away
all
her
girlish
nervous
fear
.
  
<EOS>
She
went
;
and
she
came
back
.
<EOS>
Neither
man
nor
spirit
had
she
seen
;
the
wind
was
blowing
on
the
height
enough
to
sweep
all
creatures
before
it
;
but
no
one
was
coming
.
  
<EOS>
So
they
sate
down
again
to
keep
watch
.
<EOS>
At
length
his
step
was
heard
close
to
the
door
;
and
it
startled
them
even
in
their
state
of
expectation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
feyther
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Sylvia
as
he
entered
;
while
his
wife
stood
up
trembling
,
but
not
saying
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
A'm
a'most
done
up
,
"
said
he
,
sitting
heavily
down
on
the
chair
nearest
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
old
feyther
!
<EOS>
"
said
Sylvia
,
stooping
to
take
off
his
heavy
clogged
shoes
;
while
Bell
took
the
posset
out
of
the
oven
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
this
?
<EOS>
posset
?
<EOS>
what
creatures
women
is
for
slops
,
"
said
he
;
but
he
drank
it
all
the
same
,
while
Sylvia
fastened
the
door
,
and
brought
the
flaring
candle
from
the
window
-
seat
.
<EOS>
The
fresh
arrangement
of
light
displayed
his
face
blackened
with
smoke
,
and
his
clothes
disarranged
and
torn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
's
been
melling
wi
'
thee
?
"
asked
Bell
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
one
has
melled
wi
'
me
;
but
a've
been
mellin
'
wi

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thee

"
<EOS>
exclaimed
both
the
women
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
they
knowed
better
.
<EOS>
They'n
getten

<EOS>
Next

on

'll
ax

Daniel
Robson
is

.
<EOS>
A've
led
a
resky
this
neet
,
and
saved
nine
or
ten
honest
chaps
as
was
pressed
,
and
carried
off
to
t

Randyvowse
.
<EOS>
Me
and
some
others
did
it
.
<EOS>
And
Hobbs

and
by
this
time

pretty
nigh

,
ready
for

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thou'rt
niver
for
saying

it
down

asked
Bell
.
  
<EOS>
"
Na

up

Hobbs

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
so
he
went
on
to
tell
of
the
ruse
by
which
they
had
been
enticed
into
the
market
-
place
;
interrupted
from
time
to
time
by
their
eager
questions
,
and
interrupting
himself
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
with
exclamations
of
weariness
and
pain
,
which
made
him
at
last
say
,
    
"
Now
a'm
willing
to
tell
yo
'
a
'
about
it
to

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
went
wearily
upstairs
,
and
wife
and
daughter
both
strove
their
best
to
ease
his
aching
limbs
,
and
make
him
comfortable
.
<EOS>
The
warming
-
pan
,
only
used
on
state
occasions
,
was
taken
down
and
unpapered
for
his
service
;
and
as
he
got
between
the
warm
sheets
,
he
thanked
Sylvia
and
her
mother
in
a
sleepy
voice
,
adding
,
    
"
It
's
a
vast
o

and
then
slumber
fell
upon
him
,
and
he
was
hardly
roused
by
Bell
's
softly
kissing
his
weather
-
beaten
cheek
,
and
saying
low
,
    
"
God
bless
thee
,
my
man
!
<EOS>
Thou
was
allays
for
them
that
was
down
and
put
upon
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
murmured
some
monosyllabic
reply
,
unheard
by
his
wife
,
who
stole
away
to
undress
herself
noiselessly
,
and
laid
herself
down
on
her
side
of
the
bed
as
gently
as
her
stiffened
limbs
would
permit
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
late
in
rising
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
Kester
was
long
since
up
and
at
his
work
among
the
cattle
before
he
saw
the
house
-
door
open
to
admit
the
fresh
chill
morning
air
;
and
even
then
Sylvia
brushed
softly
,
and
went
about
almost
on
tip
-
toe
.
<EOS>
When
the
porridge
was
ready
,
Kester
was
called
in
to
his
breakfast
,
which
he
took
sitting
at
the
dresser
with
the
family
.
<EOS>
A
large
wooden
platter
stood
in
the
middle
;
and
each
had
a
bowl
of
the
same
material
filled
with
milk
.
<EOS>
The
way
was
for
every
one
to
dip
his
pewter
spoon
into
the
central
dish
,
and
convey
as
much
or
as
little
as
he
liked
at
a
time
of
the
hot
porridge
into
his
pure
fresh
milk
.
<EOS>
But
to
-
day
Bell
told
Kester
to
help
himself
all
at
once
,
and
to
take
his
bowl
up
to
the
master
's
room
and
keep
him
company
.
<EOS>
For
Daniel
was
in
bed
,
resting
from
his
weariness
,
and
bemoaning
his
painful
bruises
whenever
he
thought
of
them
.
<EOS>
But
his
mind
was
still
so
much
occupied
with
the
affair
of
the
previous
night
,
that
Bell
judged
rightly
that
a
new
listener
would
give
ease
to
his
body
as
well
as
to
his
mind
,
and
her
proposal
of
Kester
's
carrying
up
his
breakfast
had
been
received
by
Daniel
with
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
So
Kester
went
up
slowly
,
carrying
his
over
-
full
basin
tenderly
,
and
seated
himself
on
the
step
leading
down
into
the
bed
-
room
(
for
levels
had
not
been
calculated
when
the
old
house
was
built
)
facing
his
master
,
who
,
half
sitting
up
in
the
blue
check
bed
,
not
unwillingly
began
his
relation
again
;
to
which
Kester
listened
so
attentively
,
that
his
spoon
was
often
arrested
in
its
progress
from
the
basin
to
his
mouth
,
open
ready
to
receive
it
,
while
he
gazed
with
unwinking
eyes
at
Daniel
narrating
his
exploits
.
  
<EOS>
But
after
Daniel
had
fought
his
battle
o'er
again
to
every
auditor
within
his
reach
,
he
found
the
seclusion
of
his
chamber
rather
oppressive
,
without
even
the
usual
week
-
days
'
noises
below
;
so
after
dinner
,
though
far
from
well
,
he
came
down
and
wandered
about
the
stable
and
the
fields
nearest
to
the
house
,
consulting
with
Kester
as
to
crops
and
manure
for
the
most
part
;
but
every
now
and
then
breaking
out
into
an
episodical
chuckle
over
some
part
of
last
night
's
proceedings
.
<EOS>
Kester
enjoyed
the
day
even
more
than
his
master
,
for
he
had
no
bruises
to
remind
him
that
,
although
a
hero
,
he
was
also
flesh
and
blood
.
  
<EOS>
When
they
returned
to
the
house
they
found
Philip
there
,
for
it
was
already
dusk
.
<EOS>
It
was
Kester
's
usual
Sunday
plan
to
withdraw
to
bed
at
as
early
an
hour
as
he
could
manage
to
sleep
,
often
in
winter
before
six
;
but
now
he
was
too
full
of
interest
in
what
Philip
might
have
to
tell
of
Monkshaven
news
to
forego
his
Sabbath
privilege
of
spending
the
evening
sitting
on
the
chair
at
the
end
of
the
dresser
behind
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
was
as
close
to
Sylvia
as
he
could
possibly
get
without
giving
her
offence
,
when
they
came
in
.
<EOS>
Her
manner
was
listless
and
civil
;
she
had
lost
all
that
active
feeling
towards
him
which
made
him
positively
distasteful
,
and
had
called
out
her
girlish
irritation
and
impertinence
.
<EOS>
She
now
was
rather
glad
to
see
him
than
otherwise
.
<EOS>
He
brought
some
change
into
the
heavy
monotony
of
her
life
 
monotony
so
peaceful
until
she
had
been
stirred
by
passion
out
of
that
content
with
the
small
daily
events
which
had
now
become
burdensome
recurrences
.
<EOS>
Insensibly
to
herself
she
was
becoming
dependent
on
his
timid
devotion
,
his
constant
attention
;
and
he
,
<EOS>
lover
-
like
,
once
so
attracted
,
in
spite
of
his
judgment
,
by
her
liveliness
and
piquancy
,
now
doted
on
her
languor
,
and
thought
her
silence
more
sweet
than
words
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
only
just
arrived
when
master
and
man
came
in
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
to
afternoon
chapel
;
none
of
them
had
thought
of
going
to
the
distant
church
;
worship
with
them
was
only
an
occasional
duty
,
and
this
day
their
minds
had
been
too
full
of
the
events
of
the
night
before
.
<EOS>
Daniel
sate
himself
heavily
down
in
his
accustomed
chair
,
the
three
-
cornered
arm
-
chair
in
the
fireside
corner
,
which
no
one
thought
of
anybody
else
ever
occupying
on
any
occasion
whatever
.
<EOS>
In
a
minute
or
two
he
interrupted
Philip
's
words
of
greeting
and
inquiry
by
breaking
out
into
the
story
of
the
rescue
of
last
night
.
<EOS>
But
to
the
mute
surprise
of
Sylvia
,
the
only
one
who
noticed
it
,
Philip
's
face
,
instead
of
expressing
admiration
and
pleasant
wonder
,
lengthened
into
dismay
;
once
or
twice
he
began
to
interrupt
,
but
stopped
himself
as
if
he
would
consider
his
words
again
.
<EOS>
Kester
was
never
tired
of
hearing
his
master
talk
;
by
long
living
together
they
understood
every
fold
of
each
other
's
minds
,
and
small
expressions
had
much
significance
to
them
.
<EOS>
Bell
,
too
,
sate
thankful
that
her
husband
should
have
done
such
deeds
.
<EOS>
Only
Sylvia
was
made
uneasy
by
Philip
's
face
and
manner
.
<EOS>
When
Daniel
had
ended
there
was
a
great
silence
,
instead
of
the
questions
and
compliments
he
looked
to
receive
.
<EOS>
He
became
testy
,
and
turning
to
Bell
,
said
,
    
"
My
nephew
looks
as
though
he
was
a
-
thinking
more
on
t
'
little
profit
he
has
made
on
his
pins
an
'
bobs
,
than
as
if
he
was
heeding
how
honest
men
were
saved
from
being
haled
out
to
yon
tender
,
an
'
carried
out
o
'
<EOS>
sight
o
'
wives
and
little
'
uns
for
iver
.
<EOS>
Wives
an
'
little
'
uns
may
go
t
'
workhouse
or
clem
for
aught
he
cares
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
went
very
red
,
and
then
more
sallow
than
usual
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
been
thinking
of
Charley
Kinraid
,
but
of
quite
another
thing
,
while
Daniel
had
told
his
story
;
but
this
last
speech
of
the
old
man
's
brought
up
the
remembrance
that
was
always
quick
,
do
what
he
would
to
smother
or
strangle
it
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
speak
for
a
moment
or
two
<EOS>
,
then
he
said
,
    
"
To
-
day
has
not
been
like
Sabbath
in
Monkshaven
.
<EOS>
T
'
rioters
,
as
folks
call
'em
,
have
been
about
all
night
.
<EOS>
They
wanted
to
give
battle
to
t
'
men
-
<EOS>
o
'
 
war
's
men
;
and
<EOS>
it
were
taken
up
by
th
'
better
end
,
and
they
've
sent
to
my
Lord
Malton
for
t
'
militia
;
and
they
're
come
into
t
'
town
,
and
they
're
hunting
for
a
justice
for
t
'
read
th
'
act
;
folk
do
say
there
'll
be
niver
a
shop
opened
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
rather
a
more
serious
account
of
the
progress
of
the
affair
than
any
one
had
calculated
upon
.
<EOS>
They
looked
grave
upon
it
awhile
,
then
Daniel
took
heart
and
said
,
    
"
A
think
we
'd
done
a'most
enough
last
neet
;
<EOS>
but
men
's
not
to
be
stopped
wi
'
a
straw
when
their
blood
is
up
;
still
it
's
hard
lines
to
call
out
t
'
sojers
,
even
if
they
be
but
militia
.
<EOS>
So
what
we
seven
hatched
in
a
dark
entry
has
ta'en
a
lord
to
put
a
stop
to
'
t
!
"
<EOS>
continued
he
,
chuckling
a
little
,
but
more
faintly
this
time
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
went
on
,
still
graver
than
before
,
boldly
continuing
to
say
what
he
knew
would
be
discordant
to
the
family
he
loved
so
well
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
ha
'
telled
yo
'
all
about
it
;
I
thought
on
it
just
as
a
bit
o
'
news
;
<EOS>
I
'd
niver
thought
on
such
a
thing
as
uncle
there
having
been
in
it
,
and
I
'm
main
sorry
to
hear
on
it
,
I
am
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
said
Sylvia
,
breathlessly
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
niver
a
thing
to
be
sorry
on
.
<EOS>
I
'm
proud
and
glad
,
"
said
Bell
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
-
a
-
be
,
let
-
a
-
be
,
"
said
Daniel
,
in
much
dudgeon
.
<EOS>
"
A
were
a
fool
to
tell
him
o
'
such
-
like
doings
,
they
're
noane
<EOS>
i
'
his
line
;
we
'll
talk
on
yard
measures
now
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
took
no
notice
of
this
poor
attempt
at
sarcasm
:
he
seemed
as
if
lost
in
thought
,
then
he
said
,
    
"
I
'm
vexed
to
plague
yo
'
,
<EOS>
but
I
'd
best
say
all
I
've
got
<EOS>
i
'
my
mind
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
vast
o
'
folk
at
our
chapel
speaking
about
it
 
<EOS>
last
night
's
doings
and
this
morning
's
work
 
and
how
them
as
set
<EOS>
it
afoot
<EOS>
was
assured
o
'
<EOS>
being
clapt
int
'
prison
and
tried
for
it
;
and
when
I
heered
uncle
<EOS>
say
as
he
was
one
,
it
like
ran
through
me
;
for
they
say
as
t
'
justices
will
be
all
on
t
'
Government
side
,
and
mad
for
vengeance
.
"
  
<EOS>
For
an
instant
there
was
dead
silence
.
<EOS>
The
women
looked
at
each
other
with
blank
eyes
,
as
if
they
were
as
yet
unable
to
take
in
the
new
idea
that
the
conduct
which
had
seemed
to
them
a
subject
for
such
just
pride
could
be
regarded
by
any
one
as
deserving
of
punishment
or
retribution
.
<EOS>
Daniel
spoke
before
they
had
recovered
from
their
amazement
.
  
<EOS>
"
A'm
noane
sorry
for
what
a
did
,
an
'
a'd
do
it
again
to
-
neet
,
if
need
were
.
<EOS>
So
theere
's
for
thee
.
<EOS>
Thou
may
tell
t
'
justices
fra
'
me
that
a
reckon
a
did
righter
nor
them
,
as
letten
poor
fellys
be
carried
off
i
'
t
'
very
midst
o
'
t
'
town
they
're
called
justices
for
.
"
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
Philip
had
better
have
held
his
tongue
;
but
he
believed
in
the
danger
,
which
he
was
anxious
to
impress
upon
his
uncle
,
in
order
that
,
knowing
what
was
to
be
apprehended
,
the
latter
might
take
some
pains
to
avert
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
they
're
making
a
coil
about
the
Randyvowse
being
all
destroyed
!
"
  
<EOS>
Daniel
had
taken
down
his
pipe
from
the
shelf
in
the
chimney
corner
,
and
was
stuffing
tobacco
into
the
bowl
.
<EOS>
He
went
on
pretending
to
do
this
a
little
while
after
it
was
filled
;
for
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
he
was
beginning
to
feel
uncomfortable
at
the
new
view
of
his
conduct
presented
to
him
.
<EOS>
Still
he
was
not
going
to
let
this
appear
,
so
lifting
up
his
head
with
an
indifferent
air
<EOS>
he
lighted
the
pipe
,
blew
into
it
,
took
it
out
and
examined
it
as
something
were
wrong
about
it
,
and
until
that
was
put
to
rights
<EOS>
he
was
unable
to
attend
to
anything
else
;
all
the
while
the
faithful
three
who
hung
upon
his
well
-
being
,
gazing
,
breathless
,
at
his
proceedings
,
and
anxious
for
his
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
Randyvowse
!
"
said
he
at
length
,
"
it
were
a
good
job
it
were
brenned
down
,
for
such
a
harbour
for
vermin
<EOS>
a
never
seed
:
t

rats
ran
across
t

yard
by
hunders
an
'
thousands
;
an

it
were
no
man

property
as
a've
heerd
tell
,
but
belonged
to
Chancery

up

i
'
Lunnon
;
so
wheere
's
t
'
harm
done
,
my
fine
felly
?
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
was
silent
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
care
to
brave
any
further
his
uncle
's
angry
frown
and
contracted
eye
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
only
known
of
Daniel
Robson
's
part
in
the
riot
before
he
had
left
the
town
,
he
would
have
taken
care
to
have
had
better
authority
for
the
reality
of
the
danger
which
he
had
heard
spoken
about
,
and
in
which
he
could
not
help
believing
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
he
could
only
keep
quiet
until
he
had
ascertained
what
was
the
legal
peril
overhanging
the
rioters
,
and
how
far
his
uncle
had
been
recognized
.
  
<EOS>
Daniel
went
on
puffing
angrily
.
<EOS>
Kester
sighed
audibly
,
and
then
was
sorry
he
had
done
so
,
and
began
to
whistle
.
<EOS>
Bell
,
full
of
her
new
fear
,
yet
desirous
to
bring
all
present
into
some
kind
of
harmony
,
said
,
    
"
It
'll
ha
'
been
a
loss
to
John
Hobbs

out
Daniel
,
shaking
the
ash
out
of
his
pipe
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do

fire
,
feyther
'll
be
for
giving
him
summut
,
"
said
Sylvia
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thou
knows
nought
about
it
,
"
said
Daniel
.
<EOS>
"
Hold
thy
tongue
next
time
till
thou
's
axed
to
speak
,
my
wench
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
sharp
irritated
way
of
speaking
was
so
new
to
Sylvia
,
that
the
tears
sprang
to
her
eyes
,
and
her
lip
quivered
.
<EOS>
Philip
saw
it
all
,
and
yearned
over
her
.
<EOS>
He
plunged
headlong
into
some
other
subject
to
try
and
divert
attention
from
her
;
but
Daniel
was
too
ill
at
ease
to
talk
much
,
and
Bell
was
obliged
to
try
and
keep
up
the
semblance
of
conversation
,
with
an
occasional
word
or
two
from
Kester
,
who
seemed
instinctively
to
fall
into
her
way
of
thinking
,
and
to
endeavour
to
keep
the
dark
thought
in
the
background
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
stole
off
to
bed
;
more
concerned
at
her
father
's
angry
way
of
speaking
than
at
the
idea
of
his
being
amenable
to
law
for
what
he
had
done
;
the
one
was
a
sharp
present
evil
,
the
other
something
distant
and
unlikely
.
<EOS>
Yet
a
dim
terror
of
this
latter
evil
hung
over
her
,
and
once
upstairs
she
threw
herself
on
her
bed
and
sobbed
.
<EOS>
Philip
heard
her
where
he
sate
near
the
bottom
of
the
short
steep
staircase
,
and
at
every
sob
the
cords
of
love
round
his
heart
seemed
tightened
,
and
he
felt
as
if
he
must
there
and
then
do
something
to
console
her
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
instead
,
he
sat
on
talking
of
nothings
,
a
conversation
in
which
Daniel
joined
with
somewhat
of
surliness
,
while
Bell
,
grave
and
anxious
,
kept
wistfully
looking
from
one
to
the
other
,
desirous
of
gleaning
some
further
information
on
the
subject
,
which
had
begun
to
trouble
her
mind
.
<EOS>
She
hoped
some
chance
would
give
her
the
opportunity
of
privately
questioning
Philip
,
but
it
seemed
to
be
equally
her
husband
's
wish
to
thwart
any
such
intention
of
hers
.
<EOS>
He
remained
in
the
house
-
place
,
till
after
Philip
had
left
,
although
he
was
evidently
so
much
fatigued
as
to
give
some
very
distinct
,
though
unintentional
,
hints
to
his
visitor
to
be
gone
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
the
house
-
door
was
locked
on
Philip
,
and
then
Daniel
prepared
to
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
Kester
had
left
for
his
loft
above
the
shippen
more
than
an
hour
before
.
<EOS>
Bell
had
still
to
rake
the
fire
,
and
then
she
would
follow
her
husband
upstairs
.
  
<EOS>
As
she
was
scraping
up
the
ashes
,
she
heard
,
intermixed
with
the
noise
she
was
making
,
the
sound
of
some
one
rapping
gently
at
the
window
.
<EOS>
In
her
then
frame
of
mind
she
started
a
little
;
but
on
looking
round
,
she
saw
Kester
's
face
pressed
against
the
glass
,
and
,
reassured
,
she
softly
opened
the
door
.
<EOS>
There
he
stood
in
the
dusk
outer
air
,
distinct
against
the
gray
darkness
beyond
,
and
in
his
hand
something
which
she
presently
perceived
was
a
pitchfork
.
  
<EOS>
"
Missus
!
"
<EOS>
whispered
he
,
"
a've
watched
t
'
maister
t
'
bed
;
an
'
now
a'd
be
greatly
beholden
to
yo
'
if
yo'd
let
me
just
lay
me
down
i
'
t
'
house
-
place
.
<EOS>
A'd
warrant
niver
<EOS>
a
constable
i
'
<EOS>
a
'
Monkshaven
should
get
sight
o
'
t
'
maister
,
an
'
me
below
t
'
keep
ward
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bell
shivered
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
Kester
,
"
she
said
,
patting
her
hand
kindly
on
his
shoulder
;
"
there
's
nought
for
t
'
fear
.
<EOS>
Thy
master
is
not
one
for
t
'
hurt
nobody
;
and
I
dunnot
think
they
can
harm
him
for
setting
yon
poor
chaps
free
,
as
t
'
gang
catched
<EOS>
i
'
their
wicked
trap
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Kester
stood
still
;
then
he
shook
his
head
slowly
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
t
'
work
at
t
'
Randyvowse
as
a'm
afeared
on
.
<EOS>
Some
folks
thinks
such
a
deal
o
'
a
bonfire
.
<EOS>
Then
a
may
lay
me
down
afore
t
'
fire
,
missus
?
<EOS>
"
said
he
,
beseechingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
Kester
 
'
she
began
;
but
suddenly
changing
,
she
said
,
"
God
bless
thee
,
my
man
;
come
in
and
lay
thee
down
on
t
'
settle
,
and
I
'll
cover
thee
up
wi
'
my
cloak
as
hangs
behind
t
'
door
.
<EOS>
We
're
not
many
on
us
that
love
him
,
an
'
we
'll
be
all
on
us
under
one
roof
,
an
'
niver
a
stone
wall
or
a
lock
betwixt
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
So
Kester
took
up
his
rest
in
the
house
-
place
that
night
,
and
none
knew
of
it
besides
Bell
.
    
<EOS>
COMING
<EOS>
TROUBLES
  
<EOS>
The
morning
brought
more
peace
if
it
did
not
entirely
dissipate
fear
.
<EOS>
Daniel
seemed
to
have
got
over
his
irritability
,
and
was
unusually
kind
and
tender
to
wife
and
daughter
,
especially
striving
by
silent
little
deeds
to
make
up
for
the
sharp
words
he
had
said
the
night
before
to
the
latter
.
  
<EOS>
As
if
by
common
consent
,
all
allusion
to
the
Saturday
night
's
proceedings
was
avoided
.
<EOS>
They
spoke
of
the
day
's
work
before
them
;
of
the
crops
to
be
sown
;
of
the
cattle
;
of
the
markets
;
but
each
one
was
conscious
of
a
wish
to
know
more
distinctly
what
were
the
chances
of
the
danger
that
,
to
judge
from
Philip
's
words
,
hung
over
them
,
falling
upon
them
and
cutting
them
off
from
all
these
places
for
the
coming
days
.
  
<EOS>
Bell
longed
to
send
Kester
down
into
Monkshaven
as
a
sort
of
spy
to
see
how
the
land
lay
;
but
she
dared
not
manifest
her
anxiety
to
her
husband
,
and
could
not
see
Kester
alone
.
<EOS>
She
wished
that
she
had
told
him
to
go
to
the
town
,
when
she
had
had
him
to
herself
in
the
house
-
place
the
night
before
;
now
it
seemed
as
though
Daniel
were
resolved
not
to
part
from
him
,
and
as
though
both
had
forgotten
that
any
peril
had
been
anticipated
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
and
her
mother
,
in
like
manner
,
clung
together
,
not
speaking
of
their
fears
,
yet
each
knowing
that
it
was
ever
present
in
the
other
's
mind
.
  
<EOS>
So
things
went
on
till
twelve
o'clock
 
dinner
-
time
.
<EOS>
If
at
any
time
that
morning
they
had
had
the
courage
to
speak
together
on
the
thought
which
was
engrossing
all
their
minds
,
it
is
possible
that
some
means
might
have
been
found
to
avert
the
calamity
that
was
coming
towards
them
with
swift
feet
.
<EOS>
But
among
the
uneducated
 
the
partially
educated
 
nay
,
even
the
weakly
educated
 
<EOS>
the
feeling
exists
which
prompted
the
futile
experiment
of
the
well
-
known
ostrich
.
<EOS>
They
imagine
that
,
by
closing
their
own
eyes
to
apprehended
evil
,
they
avert
it
.
<EOS>
The
expression
of
fear
is
supposed
to
accelerate
the
coming
of
its
cause
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
on
the
other
hand
,
they
shrink
from
acknowledging
the
long
continuance
of
any
blessing
,
in
the
idea
that
when
unusual
happiness
is
spoken
about
,
it
disappears
.
<EOS>
So
,
although
perpetual
complaints
of
past
or
present
grievances
and
sorrows
are
most
common
among
this
class
,
they
shrink
from
embodying
apprehensions
for
the
future
in
words
,
as
if
it
then
took
shape
and
drew
near
.
  
<EOS>
They
all
four
sate
down
to
dinner
,
but
not
one
of
them
was
inclined
to
eat
.
<EOS>
The
food
was
scarcely
touched
on
their
plates
,
yet
they
were
trying
to
make
talk
among
themselves
as
usual
<EOS>
;
they
seemed
as
though
they
dared
not
let
themselves
be
silent
,
when
Sylvia
,
sitting
opposite
to
the
window
,
saw
Philip
at
the
top
of
the
brow
,
running
rapidly
towards
the
farm
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
so
full
of
the
anticipation
of
some
kind
of
misfortune
all
the
morning
that
she
felt
now
as
if
this
was
the
very
precursive
circumstance
she
had
been
expecting
;
she
stood
up
,
turning
quite
white
,
and
,
pointing
with
her
finger
,
said
,
    
"
There
he
is
!
"
  
<EOS>
Every
one
at
table
stood
up
too
.
<EOS>
An
instant
afterwards
,
Philip
,
breathless
,
was
in
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
He
gasped
out
,
"
They
're
coming
!
<EOS>
the
warrant
is
out
.
<EOS>
You
must
go
.
<EOS>
I
hoped
you
were
gone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
God
help
us
!
"
said
Bell
,
and
sate
suddenly
down
,
as
if
she
had
received
a
blow
that
made
her
collapse
into
helplessness
;
but
she
got
up
again
directly
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
flew
for
her
father
's
hat
.
<EOS>
He
really
seemed
the
most
unmoved
of
the
party
.
  
<EOS>
"
A'm
noane
afeared
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A'd
do
it
o'er
again
,
a
would
;
an
'
a'll
tell
'em
so
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
fine
time
o
'
day
when
men
's
to
be
trapped
and
carried
off
,
<EOS>
an
'
them
as
lays
traps
to
set
'em
free
is
to
be
put
i
'
t
'
lock
-
ups
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
there
was
rioting
,
beside
the
rescue
;
t
'
house
was
burnt
,
"
continued
eager
,
breathless
Philip
.
  
<EOS>
"
An
'
a'm
noane
goin'
<EOS>
t
'
say
a'm
sorry
for
that
,
neyther
;
tho
'
,
mebbe
,
a
would
n't
do
it
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
had
his
hat
on
his
head
by
this
time
;
and
Bell
,
wan
and
stiff
,
trembling
all
over
,
had
his
over
-
coat
,
and
his
leather
purse
with
the
few
coins
she
could
muster
,
ready
for
him
to
put
on
.
  
<EOS>
He
looked
at
these
preparations
,
at
his
wife
and
daughter
,
and
his
colour
changed
from
its
ruddy
brown
.
  
<EOS>
"
A'd
face
lock
-
ups
,
an
'
a
fair
spell
o
'
jail
,
but
for
these
,
"
said
he
,
hesitating
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Philip
,
"
for
God
's
sake
,
lose
no
time
,
but
be
off
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
mun
he
go
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Bell
,
as
if
Philip
must
decide
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
Anywhere
,
anywhere
,
out
of
this
house
 
say
Haverstone
.
<EOS>
This
evening
,
I
'll
go
and
meet
him
there
and
plan
further
;
only
be
off
now
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Philip
was
so
keenly
eager
,
he
hardly
took
note
at
the
time
of
Sylvia
's
one
vivid
look
of
unspoken
thanks
,
yet
he
remembered
it
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
"
A'll
dang
'em
dead
,
"
said
Kester
,
rushing
to
the
door
,
for
he
saw
what
the
others
did
not
 
that
all
chance
of
escape
was
over
;
the
constables
were
already
at
the
top
of
the
little
field
-
path
not
twenty
yards
off
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hide
him
,
hide
him
,
"
cried
Bell
,
wringing
her
hands
in
terror
;
for
she
,
indeed
they
all
,
knew
that
flight
would
now
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
Daniel
was
heavy
,
rheumatic
,
and
,
moreover
,
had
been
pretty
severely
bruised
on
that
unlucky
night
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
,
without
another
word
,
pushed
Daniel
before
him
upstairs
,
feeling
that
his
own
presence
at
Haytersbank
Farm
at
that
hour
of
the
day
would
be
a
betrayal
.
<EOS>
They
had
just
time
to
shut
themselves
up
in
the
larger
bed
-
room
,
before
they
heard
a
scuffle
and
the
constables
'
entry
down
-
stairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
're
in
,
"
said
Philip
,
as
Daniel
squeezed
himself
under
the
bed
;
and
then
they
held
quite
still
,
Philip
as
much
concealed
by
the
scanty
,
blue
-
check
curtain
as
he
could
manage
to
be
.
<EOS>
They
heard
a
confusion
of
voices
below
,
a
hasty
moving
of
chairs
,
a
banging
of
doors
,
a
further
parley
,
and
then
a
woman
's
scream
,
shrill
and
pitiful
;
then
steps
on
the
stairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
screech
spoiled
all
,
"
sighed
Philip
.
  
<EOS>
In
one
instant
the
door
was
opened
,
and
each
of
the
hiders
was
conscious
of
the
presence
of
the
constables
,
although
at
first
the
latter
stood
motionless
,
surveying
the
apparently
empty
room
with
disappointment
.
<EOS>
Then
in
another
moment
they
had
rushed
at
Philip
's
legs
,
exposed
as
these
were
.
<EOS>
They
drew
him
out
with
violence
,
and
then
let
him
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
Measter
Hepburn
!
"
said
one
in
amaze
.
<EOS>
But
immediately
they
put
two
and
two
together
;
for
in
so
small
a
place
as
Monkshaven
every
one
's
relationships
and
connexions
,
and
even
likings
,
were
known
;
and
the
motive
of
Philip
's
coming
out
to
Haytersbank
was
perfectly
clear
to
these
men
.
  
<EOS>
"
T
'
other
'll
not
be
far
off
,
"
said
the
other
constable
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
plate
were
down
-
stairs
,
full
o
'
victual
;
<EOS>
a
seed
Measter
Hepburn
a
-
walking
briskly
before
me
as
a
left
Monkshaven
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Here
he
be
,
here
he
be
,
"
called
out
the
other
man
,
dragging
Daniel
out
by
his
legs
,
"
we
've
getten
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Daniel
kicked
violently
,
and
came
out
from
his
hiding
-
place
in
a
less
ignominious
way
than
by
being
pulled
out
by
his
heels
.
  
<EOS>
He
shook
himself
,
and
then
turned
,
facing
his
captors
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
wish
a'd
niver
hidden
mysel
'
;
it
were
his
doing
,
"
jerking
his
thumb
toward
Philip
:
"
a'm
ready
to
stand
by
what
a've
done
.
<EOS>
Yo've
getten
a
warrant
a'll
be
bound
,
for
them
justices
is
grand
at
writin
'
when
t
'
fight
's
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
trying
to
carry
it
off
with
bravado
,
but
Philip
saw
that
he
had
received
a
shock
,
from
his
sudden
look
of
withered
colour
and
shrunken
feature
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't

him

"
said
Philip
,
putting
money
into
the
constable
's
hand
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
be
able
to
guard
him
well
enough
without
them
things
.
"
  
<EOS>
Daniel
turned
round
sharp
at
this
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
-
a
-
be
,
let
-
a
-
be
,
my
lad
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
It
'll
be
summut
to
think
on
i
'
t
'
lock
-
up
how
two
able

bodied
fellys
were
so
afeared
on

as

<EOS>
o

<EOS>
Saturday
neet

as
they

and

come
Martinmas

and
sore
laid
up
wi
'

rheumatics

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
it
was
difficult
to
keep
up
this
tone
of
bravado
when
he
was
led
a
prisoner
through
his
own
house
-
place
,
and
saw
his
poor
wife
quivering
and
shaking
all
over
with
her
efforts
to
keep
back
all
signs
of
emotion
until
he
was
gone
;
and
Sylvia
standing
by
her
mother
,
her
arm
round
Bell
's
waist
and
stroking
the
poor
shrunken
fingers
which
worked
so
perpetually
and
nervously
in
futile
unconscious
restlessness
.
<EOS>
Kester
was
in
a
corner
of
the
room
,
sullenly
standing
.
  
<EOS>
Bell
quaked
from
head
to
foot
as
her
husband
came
down
-
stairs
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
She
opened
her
lips
several
times
with
an
uneasy
motion
,
as
if
she
would
fain
say
something
,
but
knew
not
what
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
's
passionate
swollen
lips
and
her
beautiful
defiant
eyes
gave
her
face
quite
a
new
aspect
;
she
looked
a
helpless
fury
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
may
kiss
my
missus
,
a
reckon
,
"
said
Daniel
,
coming
to
a
standstill
as
he
passed
near
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Dannel
,
Dannel
!
"
cried
she
,
opening
her
arms
wide
to
receive
him
.
"
<EOS>
Dannel
,
Dannel
,
my
man
!
"
<EOS>
and
she
shook
with
her
crying
,
laying
her
head
on
his
shoulder
,
as
if
he
was
all
her
stay
and
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
missus
!
<EOS>
come
,
missus
!
"
<EOS>
said
he
,
"
there
could
n't
be
more
ado
if
a'd
been
guilty
of

an

yet

for

.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
voice
was
quavering
as
he
said
this
.
<EOS>
But
he
cheered
up
a
little
and
said
,
"
Now
,
good
-
by
,
oud
wench
"
<EOS>
(
kissing
her
)
,
"
and
keep
a
good

,
and
let
me
see

lookin

lusty
and
strong

<EOS>
Good

by
,
my
lass
;
look
well
after
mother
,
and
ask
Philip
for
guidance
if
it
's
needed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
taken
out
of
his
home
,
and
then
arose
the
shrill
cries
of
the
women
;
but
in
a
minute
or
two
they
were
checked
by
the
return
of
one
of
the
constables
,
who
,
cap
in
hand
at
the
sight
of
so
much
grief
,
<EOS>
said
,
    
"
He
wants
a
word
wi
'
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
party
had
come
to
a
halt
about
ten
yards
from
the
house
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
,
hastily
wiping
her
tears
on
her
apron
,
ran
out
and
threw
her
arms
round
her
father
,
as
if
to
burst
out
afresh
on
his
neck
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
nay
,
my
wench
,
it
's
thee
as
mun
be
a
comfort
to
mother
:
nay
,
nay

thou'll
niver

what
a've
got
to
say
.
<EOS>
Sylvie
,
my

a'm

and
sorry

a

so
short
wi

and

Thou

but

thee

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
feyther
!
<EOS>
feyther
!
<EOS>
"
was
all
Sylvia
could
say
;
and
at
last
they
had
to
make
as
though
they
would
have
used
force
to
separate
her
from
their
prisoner
.
<EOS>
Philip
took
her
hand
,
and
softly
led
her
back
to
her
weeping
mother
.
  
<EOS>
For
some
time
nothing
was
to
be
heard
in
the
little
farmhouse
kitchen
but
the
sobbing
and
wailing
of
the
women
.
<EOS>
Philip
stood
by
silent
,
thinking
,
as
well
as
he
could
,
for
his
keen
sympathy
with
their
grief
,
what
had
best
be
done
next
.
<EOS>
Kester
,
after
some
growls
at
Sylvia
for
having
held
back
the
uplifted
arm
which
he
thought
might
have
saved
Daniel
by
a
well
-
considered
blow
on
his
captors
as
they
entered
the
house
,
went
back
into
his
shippen
 
his
cell
for
meditation
and
consolation
,
where
he
might
hope
to
soothe
himself
before
going
out
to
his
afternoon
's
work
;
labour
which
his
master
had
planned
for
him
that
very
morning
,
with
a
strange
foresight
,
as
Kester
thought
,
for
the
job
was
one
which
would
take
him
two
or
three
days
without
needing
any
further
directions
than
those
he
had
received
,
and
by
the
end
of
that
time
he
thought
that
his
master
would
be
at
liberty
again
.
<EOS>
So
he
 
<EOS>
so
they
all
thought
in
their
ignorance
and
inexperience
.
  
<EOS>
Although
Daniel
himself
was
unreasoning
,
hasty
,
impulsive
 
in
a
word
,
often
thinking
and
acting
very
foolishly
 
yet
,
somehow
,
either
from
some
quality
in
his
character
,
or
from
the
loyalty
of
nature
in
those
with
whom
he
had
to
deal
in
his
every
-
day
life
,
he
had
made
his
place
and
position
clear
as
the
arbiter
and
law
-
giver
of
his
household
.
<EOS>
On
his
decision
,
as
that
of
husband
,
father
,
master
,
perhaps
superior
natures
waited
.
<EOS>
So
now
that
he
was
gone
and
had
left
them
in
such
strange
new
circumstances
so
suddenly
,
it
seemed
as
though
neither
Bell
nor
Sylvia
knew
exactly
what
to
do
when
their
grief
was
spent
,
so
much
had
every
household
action
and
plan
been
regulated
by
the
thought
of
him
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
Philip
had
slowly
been
arriving
at
the
conclusion
that
he
was
more
wanted
at
Monkshaven
to
look
after
Daniel
's
interests
,
to
learn
what
were
the
legal
probabilities
in
consequence
of
the
old
man
's
arrest
,
and
to
arrange
for
his
family
accordingly
,
than
standing
still
and
silent
in
the
Haytersbank
kitchen
,
too
full
of
fellow
-
feeling
and
heavy
foreboding
to
comfort
,
awkwardly
unsympathetic
in
appearance
from
the
very
aching
of
his
heart
.
  
<EOS>
So
when
his
aunt
,
with
instinctive
sense
of
regularity
and
propriety
,
began
to
put
away
the
scarcely
tasted
dinner
,
and
Sylvia
,
blinded
with
crying
,
and
convulsively
sobbing
,
was
yet
trying
to
help
her
mother
,
Philip
took
his
hat
,
and
brushing
it
round
and
round
with
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
,
said
,
    
"
I
think
I
'll
just
go
back
,
and
see
how
matters
stand
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
had
a
more
distinct
plan
in
his
head
than
these
words
implied
,
but
it
depended
on
so
many
contingencies
of
which
he
was
ignorant
that
he
said
only
these
few
words
;
and
with
a
silent
resolution
to
see
them
again
that
day
,
but
a
dread
of
being
compelled
to
express
his
fears
,
so
far
beyond
theirs
,
he
went
off
without
saying
anything
more
.
<EOS>
Then
Sylvia
lifted
up
her
voice
with
a
great
cry
.
<EOS>
Somehow
she
had
expected
him
to
do
something
 
<EOS>
what
,
she
did
not
know
;
but
he
was
gone
,
and
they
were
left
without
stay
or
help
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
thee
,
hush
thee
,
"
said
her
mother
,
trembling
all
over
herself
;
"
it
's
for
the
best
.
<EOS>
The
Lord
knows
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
niver
thought
he
'd
leave
us
,
"
moaned
Sylvia
,
half
in
her
mother
's
arms
,
and
thinking
of
Philip
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
took
the
words
as
applied
to
Daniel
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
'd
niver
ha
'
left
us
,
my
wench
,
if
he
could
ha
'
stayed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
mother
,
mother
,
it
's
Philip
as
has
left
us
,
and
he
could
ha
'
stayed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
'll
come
back
,
or
mebbe
send
,
I
'll
be
bound
.
<EOS>
Leastways
he
'll
be
gone
to
see
feyther
,
and
he
'll
need
comfort
most
on
all
,
in
a
fremd
place
 
in
Bridewell
 
and
niver
a
morsel
of
victual
or
a
piece
o
'
money
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
she
sate
down
,
and
wept
the
dry
hot
tears
that
come
with
such
difficulty
to
the
eyes
of
the
aged
.
<EOS>
And
so
 
first
one
grieving
,
and
<EOS>
then
the
other
,
and
each
draining
her
own
heart
of
every
possible
hope
by
way
of
comfort
,
alternately
trying
to
cheer
and
console
 
the
February
afternoon
passed
away
;
the
continuous
rain
closing
in
the
daylight
even
earlier
than
usual
,
and
adding
to
the
dreariness
,
with
the
natural
accompaniments
of
wailing
winds
,
coming
with
long
sweeps
over
the
moors
,
and
making
the
sobbings
at
the
windows
that
always
sound
like
the
gasps
of
some
one
in
great
agony
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
Philip
had
hastened
back
to
Monkshaven
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
umbrella
,
he
had
to
face
the
driving
rain
for
the
greater
part
of
the
way
;
but
he
was
thankful
to
the
weather
,
for
it
kept
men
indoors
,
and
he
wanted
to
meet
no
one
,
but
to
have
time
to
think
and
mature
his
plans
.
<EOS>
The
town
itself
was
,
so
to
speak
,
in
mourning
.
<EOS>
The
rescue
of
the
sailors
was
a
distinctly
popular
movement
;
the
subsequent
violence
(
which
had
,
indeed
,
gone
much
further
than
has
been
described
,
after
Daniel
left
it
)
was
,
in
general
,
considered
as
only
a
kind
of
due
punishment
inflicted
in
wild
justice
on
the
press
-
gang
and
their
abettors
.
<EOS>
The
feeling
of
the
Monkshaven
people
was
,
therefore
,
in
decided
opposition
to
the
vigorous
steps
taken
by
the
county
magistrates
,
who
,
in
consequence
of
an
appeal
from
the
naval
officers
in
charge
of
the
impressment
service
,
had
called
out
the
militia
(
from
a
distant
and
inland
county
)
stationed
within
a
few
miles
,
and
had
thus
summarily
quenched
the
riots
that
were
continuing
on
the
Sunday
morning
after
a
somewhat
languid
fashion
;
the
greater
part
of
the
destruction
of
property
having
been
accomplished
during
the
previous
night
.
<EOS>
Still
there
was
little
doubt
but
that
the
violence
would
have
been
renewed
as
evening
drew
on
,
and
the
more
desperate
part
of
the
population
and
the
enraged
sailors
had
had
the
Sabbath
leisure
to
brood
over
their
wrongs
,
and
to
encourage
each
other
in
a
passionate
attempt
at
redress
,
or
revenge
.
<EOS>
So
the
authorities
were
quite
justified
in
the
decided
steps
they
had
taken
,
both
in
their
own
estimation
then
,
and
now
,
in
ours
,
looking
back
on
the
affair
in
cold
blood
.
<EOS>
But
at
the
time
feeling
ran
strongly
against
them
;
and
all
means
of
expressing
itself
in
action
being
prevented
,
men
brooded
sullenly
in
their
own
houses
.
<EOS>
Philip
,
as
the
representative
of
the
family
,
the
head
of
which
was
now
suffering
for
his
deeds
in
the
popular
cause
,
would
have
met
with
more
sympathy
,
ay
,
and
more
respect
than
he
imagined
,
as
he
went
along
the
streets
,
glancing
from
side
to
side
,
fearful
of
meeting
some
who
would
shy
him
as
the
relation
of
one
who
had
been
ignominiously
taken
to
Bridewell
a
few
hours
before
.
<EOS>
But
in
spite
of
this
wincing
of
Philip
's
from
observation
and
remark
,
he
never
dreamed
of
acting
otherwise
than
as
became
a
brave
true
friend
.
<EOS>
And
this
he
did
,
and
would
have
done
,
from
a
natural
faithfulness
and
constancy
of
disposition
,
without
any
special
regard
for
Sylvia
.
  
<EOS>
He
knew
his
services
were
needed
in
the
shop
;
business
which
he
had
left
at
a
moment
's
warning
awaited
him
,
unfinished
;
but
at
this
time
he
could
not
bear
the
torture
of
giving
explanations
,
and
alleging
reasons
to
the
languid
intelligence
and
slow
sympathies
of
Coulson
.
  
<EOS>
He
went
to
the
offices
of
Mr.
Donkin
,
the
oldest
established
and
most
respected
attorney
in
Monkshaven
 
he
who
had
been
employed
to
draw
up
the
law
papers
and
deeds
of
partnership
consequent
on
Hepburn
and
Coulson
succeeding
to
the
shop
of
John
and
Jeremiah
Foster
,
Brothers
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Donkin
knew
Philip
from
this
circumstance
.
<EOS>
But
,
indeed
,
nearly
every
one
in
Monkshaven
knew
each
other
;
if
not
enough
to
speak
to
,
at
least
enough
to
be
acquainted
with
the
personal
appearance
and
reputation
of
most
of
those
whom
they
met
in
the
streets
.
<EOS>
It
so
happened
that
Mr.
Donkin
had
a
favourable
opinion
of
Philip
;
and
perhaps
for
this
reason
the
latter
had
a
shorter
time
to
wait
before
he
obtained
an
interview
with
the
head
of
the
house
,
than
many
of
the
clients
who
came
for
that
purpose
from
town
or
country
for
many
miles
round
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
was
ushered
in
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Donkin
sate
with
his
spectacles
pushed
up
on
his
forehead
,
ready
to
watch
his
countenance
and
listen
to
his
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
afternoon
,
Mr.
Hepburn
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
afternoon
,
sir
.
"
<EOS>
Philip
hesitated
how
to
begin
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Donkin
became
impatient
,
and
tapped
with
the
fingers
of
his
left
hand
on
his
desk
.
<EOS>
Philip
's
sensitive
nerves
felt
and
rightly
interpreted
the
action
.
  
<EOS>
"
Please
,
sir
,
I
'm
come
to
speak
to
you
about
Daniel
Robson
,
of
Haytersbank
Farm
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Daniel
Robson
?
"
said
Mr.
Donkin
,
after
a
short
pause
,
to
try
and
compel
Philip
into
speed
in
his
story
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
He
's
been
taken
up
on
account
of
this
affair
,
sir
,
about
the
press
-
gang
on
Saturday
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
be
sure
!
<EOS>
I
thought
I
knew
the
name
.
"
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Donkin
's
face
became
graver
,
and
the
expression
more
concentrated
.
<EOS>
Looking
up
suddenly
at
Philip
,
he
said
,
"
You
are
aware
that
I
am
the
clerk
to
the
magistrates
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
"
in
a
tone
that
indicated
the
unexpressed
"
What
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
I
am
.
<EOS>
And
so
of
course
,
if
you
want
my
services
or
advice
in
favour
of
a
prisoner
whom
they
have
committed
,
or
are
going
to
commit
,
you
ca
n't
have
them
,
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
sorry
 
very
!
"
said
Philip
;
and
then
he
was
again
silent
for
a
period
;
long
enough
to
make
the
busy
attorney
impatient
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mr.
Hepburn
,
have
you
anything
else
to
say
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
've
a
deal
to
ask
of
you
;
for
you
see
I
do
n't
rightly
understand
what
to
do
;
and
yet
I
'm
all
as
Daniel
's
wife
and
daughter
has
to
look
to
;
and
I
've
their
grief
heavy
on
my
heart
.
<EOS>
You
could
not
tell
me
what
is
to
be
done
with
Daniel
,
could
you
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
'll
be
brought
up
before
the
magistrates
to
-
morrow
morning
for
final
examination
,
along
with
the
others
,
you
know
,
before
he
's
sent
to
York
Castle
to
take
his
trial
at
the
spring
assizes
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
York
Castle
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Donkin
nodded
,
as
if
words
were
too
precious
to
waste
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
when
will
he
go
?
"
asked
poor
Philip
,
in
dismay
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
-
morrow
:
most
probably
as
soon
as
the
examination
is
over
.
<EOS>
The
evidence
is
clear
as
to
his
being
present
,
aiding
and
abetting
,
 
indicted
on
the
4th
section
of
1
George
I.
,
statute
1
,
chapter
5
.
<EOS>
I
'm
afraid
it
's
a
bad
look
-
out
.
<EOS>
Is
he
a
friend
of
yours
,
Mr.
Hepburn
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Only
an
uncle
,
sir
,
"
said
Philip
,
his
heart
getting
full
;
more
from
Mr.
Donkin
's
manner
than
from
his
words
.
<EOS>
"
But
what
can
they
do
to
him
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Donkin
half
smiled
at
the
ignorance
displayed
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
hang
him
,
to
be
sure
;
if
the
judge
is
in
a
hanging
mood
.
<EOS>
He
's
been
either
a
principal
in
the
offence
,
or
a
principal
in
the
second
degree
,
and
,
as
such
,
liable
to
the
full
punishment
.
<EOS>
I
drew
up
the
warrant
myself
this
morning
,
though
I
left
the
exact
name
to
be
filled
up
by
my
clerk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
sir
!
<EOS>
can
you
do
nothing
for
me
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Philip
,
with
sharp
beseeching
in
his
voice
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
imagined
that
it
was
a
capital
offence
;
and
the
thought
of
his
aunt
's
and
Sylvia
's
ignorance
of
the
possible
fate
awaiting
him
whom
they
so
much
loved
,
was
like
a
stab
to
his
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
good
fellow
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sorry
;
but
,
you
see
,
it
's
my
duty
to
do
all
I
can
to
bring
criminals
to
justice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
uncle
thought
he
was
doing
such
a
fine
deed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Demolishing
and
pulling
down
,
destroying
and
burning
dwelling
-
houses
and
outhouses
,
"
said
Mr.
Donkin
.
<EOS>
"
He
must
have
some
peculiar
notions
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
people
is
so
mad
with
the
press
-
gang
,
and
Daniel
has
been
at
sea
hisself
;
and
took
it
so
to
heart
when
he
heard
of
mariners
and
seafaring
folk
being
carried
off
,
and
just
cheated
into
doing
what
was
kind
and
helpful
 
<EOS>
leastways
,
what
would
have
been
kind
and
helpful
,
if
there
had
been
a
fire
.
<EOS>
I
'm
against
violence
and
riots
myself
,
sir
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sure
;
but
I
can
not
help
thinking
as
Daniel
had
a
deal
to
justify
him
on
Saturday
night
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
you
must
try
and
get
a
good
lawyer
to
bring
out
all
that
side
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
good
deal
to
be
said
on
it
;
but
it
's
my
duty
to
get
up
all
the
evidence
to
prove
that
he
and
others
were
present
on
the
night
in
question
;
so
,
as
you
'll
perceive
,
I
can
give
you
no
help
in
defending
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
who
can
,
sir
?
<EOS>
I
came
to
you
as
a
friend
who
,
I
thought
,
would
see
me
through
it
.
<EOS>
And
I
do
n't
know
any
other
lawyer
;
leastways
,
to
speak
to
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Donkin
was
really
more
concerned
for
the
misguided
rioters
than
he
was
aware
;
and
he
was
aware
of
more
interest
than
he
cared
to
express
.
<EOS>
So
he
softened
his
tone
a
little
,
and
tried
to
give
the
best
advice
in
his
power
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'd
better
go
to
Edward
Dawson
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
;
he
that
was
articled
clerk
with
me
two
years
ago
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
He
's
a
clever
fellow
,
and
has
not
too
much
practice
;
he
'll
do
the
best
he
can
for
you
.
<EOS>
He
'll
have
to
be
at
the
court
-
house
,
tell
him
,
to
-
morrow
morning
at
ten
,
when
the
justices
meet
.
<EOS>
He
'll
watch
the
case
for
you
;
and
then
he
'll
give
you
his
opinion
,
and
tell
you
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
do
better
than
follow
his
advice
.
<EOS>
I
must
do
all
I
can
to
collect
evidence
for
a
conviction
,
you
know
.
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
stood
up
,
looked
at
his
hat
,
and
then
came
forward
and
laid
down
six
and
eightpence
on
the
desk
in
a
blushing
,
awkward
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pooh
!
pooh
!
"
said
Mr.
Donkin
,
pushing
the
money
away
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
a
fool
;
you
'll
need
it
all
before
the
trial
's
over
.
<EOS>
I
've
done
nothing
,
man
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
pretty
thing
for
me
to
be
feed
by
both
parties
.
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
took
up
the
money
,
and
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
In
an
instant
he
came
back
again
,
glanced
furtively
at
Mr.
Donkin
's
face
,
and
then
,
once
more
having
recourse
to
brushing
his
hat
,
he
said
,
in
a
low
voice
    
<EOS>
"
You
'll
not
be
hard
upon
him
,
sir
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
do
my
duty
,
"
replied
Mr.
Donkin
,
a
little
sternly
,
"
without
any
question
of
hardness
.
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
,
discomfited
,
left
the
room
;
an
instant
of
thought
and
Mr
Donkin
had
jumped
up
,
and
hastening
to
the
door
he
opened
it
and
called
after
Philip
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hepburn
 
Hepburn
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
he
'll
be
taken
to
York
as
soon
as
may
be
to
-
morrow
morning
;
if
any
one
wants
to
see
him
before
then
,
they
'd
better
look
sharp
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
went
quickly
along
the
streets
towards
Mr.
Dawson
's
,
pondering
upon
the
meaning
of
all
that
he
had
heard
,
and
what
he
had
better
do
.
<EOS>
He
had
made
his
plans
pretty
clearly
out
by
the
time
he
arrived
at
Mr.
Dawson
's
smart
door
in
one
of
the
new
streets
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
A
clerk
as
smart
as
the
door
answered
Philip
's
hesitating
knock
,
and
replied
to
his
inquiry
as
to
whether
Mr.
Dawson
was
at
home
,
in
the
negative
,
adding
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
    
"
He
'll
be
at
home
in
less
than
an
hour
;
he
's
only
gone
to
make
Mrs
Dawson
's
<EOS>
will
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Dawson
,
of
Collyton
 
<EOS>
she
's
not
expected
to
get
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Probably
the
clerk
of
an
older
-
established
attorney
would
not
have
given
so
many
particulars
as
to
the
nature
of
his
master
's
employment
;
but
,
as
it
happened
it
was
of
no
consequence
,
the
unnecessary
information
made
no
impression
on
Philip
's
mind
;
he
thought
the
matter
over
and
then
said
    
"
I
'll
be
back
in
an
hour
,
then
.
<EOS>
It
's
gone
a
quarter
to
four
;
I
'll
be
back
before
five
,
tell
Mr.
Dawson
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
turned
on
his
heel
and
went
back
to
the
High
Street
as
fast
as
he
could
,
with
a
far
more
prompt
and
decided
step
than
before
.
<EOS>
He
hastened
through
the
streets
,
emptied
by
the
bad
weather
,
to
the
principal
inn
of
the
town
,
the
George
 
the
sign
of
which
was
fastened
to
a
piece
of
wood
stretched
across
the
narrow
street
;
and
going
up
to
the
bar
with
some
timidity
(
for
the
inn
was
frequented
by
the
gentry
of
Monkshaven
and
the
neighbourhood
,
and
was
considered
as
a
touch
above
such
customers
as
Philip
)
<EOS>
,
he
asked
if
he
could
have
a
tax
-
cart
made
ready
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
and
sent
up
to
the
door
of
his
shop
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
he
could
;
how
far
was
it
to
go
?
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
hesitated
before
he
replied
    
"
Up
the
Knotting
Lane
,
to
the
stile
leading
down
to
Haytersbank
Farm
;
they
'll
have
to
wait
there
for
some
as
are
coming
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
must
not
wait
long
such
an
evening
as
this
;
standing
in
such
rain
and
wind
as
there
'll
be
up
there
,
is
enough
to
kill
a
horse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
sha
n't
wait
long
,
"
said
Philip
,
decisively
:
"
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
now
went
back
to
the
shop
,
beating
against
the
storm
,
which
was
increasing
as
the
tide
came
in
and
the
night
hours
approached
.
  
<EOS>
Coulson
had
no
word
for
him
,
but
he
looked
reproachfully
at
his
partner
for
his
long
,
unexplained
absence
.
<EOS>
Hester
was
putting
away
the
ribbons
and
handkerchiefs
,
and
bright
-
coloured
things
which
had
been
used
to
deck
the
window
;
for
no
more
customers
were
likely
to
come
this
night
through
the
blustering
weather
to
a
shop
dimly
lighted
by
two
tallow
candles
and
an
inefficient
oil
-
lamp
.
<EOS>
Philip
came
up
to
her
,
and
stood
looking
at
her
with
unseeing
eyes
;
but
the
strange
consciousness
of
his
fixed
stare
made
her
uncomfortable
,
and
called
the
faint
flush
to
her
pale
cheeks
,
and
at
length
compelled
her
,
as
it
were
,
to
speak
,
and
break
the
spell
of
the
silence
.
<EOS>
So
,
curiously
enough
,
all
three
spoke
at
once
.
<EOS>
Hester
asked
(
without
looking
at
Philip
)
    
"
Yo're
sadly
wet
,
I
'm
feared
?
"
  
<EOS>
Coulson
said
    
"
Thou
might
have
a
bit
o
'
news
to
tell
one
after
being
on
the
gad
all
afternoon
.
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
whispered
to
Hester
    
<EOS>
"
Wilt
come
into
t
'
parlour
?
<EOS>
I
want
a
word
wi
'
thee
by
oursel
's
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hester
quietly
finished
rolling
up
the
ribbon
she
had
in
her
hands
when
he
spoke
,
and
then
followed
him
into
the
room
behind
the
shop
before
spoken
of
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
set
down
on
the
table
the
candle
which
he
had
brought
out
of
the
shop
,
and
turning
round
to
Hester
,
took
her
trembling
hand
into
both
of
his
,
and
gripping
it
nervously
,
said
    
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Hester
,
thou
must
help
me
 
thou
will
,
will
not
thou
?
"
  
<EOS>
Hester
gulped
down
something
that
seemed
to
rise
in
her
throat
and
choke
her
,
before
she
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Anything
,
thou
knows
,
Philip
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
Thou
sees
the
matter
is
this
:
Daniel
Robson
 
<EOS>
he
who
married
my
aunt
 
is
taken
up
for
yon
riot
on
Saturday
night
at
t
'
<EOS>
Mariners
'
Arms
   
'
  
<EOS>
"
They
spoke
on
it
this
afternoon
;
they
said
the
warrant
was
out
,
"
said
Hester
,
filling
up
the
sentence
as
Philip
hesitated
,
lost
for
an
instant
in
his
own
thoughts
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
<EOS>
the
warrant
is
out
,
and
he
's
in
t
'
lock
-
up
,
and
will
be
carried
to
York
Castle
to
-
morrow
morn
;
and
I
'm
afeared
it
will
go
bad
with
him
;
and
they
at
Haytersbank
is
not
prepared
,
and
they
must
see
him
again
before
he
goes
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Hester
,
will
thou
go
in
a
tax
-
cart
as
will
be
here
in
less
than
ten
minutes
from
t
'
George
,
and
bring
them
back
here
,
and
they
must
stay
all
night
for
to
be
ready
to
see
him
to
-
morrow
before
he
goes
?
<EOS>
It
's
dree
weather
for
them
,
but
they
'll
not
mind
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
used
words
as
if
he
was
making
a
request
to
Hester
;
but
he
did
not
seem
to
await
her
answer
,
so
sure
was
he
that
she
would
go
.
<EOS>
She
noticed
this
,
and
noticed
also
that
the
rain
was
spoken
of
in
reference
to
them
,
not
to
her
.
<EOS>
A
cold
shadow
passed
over
her
heart
,
though
it
was
nothing
more
than
she
already
knew
 
that
Sylvia
was
the
one
centre
of
his
thoughts
and
his
love
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
put
on
my
things
at
once
,
"
said
she
,
gently
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
pressed
her
hand
tenderly
,
a
glow
of
gratitude
overspread
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thou
's
a
real
good
one
<EOS>
,
God
bless
thee
!
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
Thou
must
take
care
of
thyself
,
too
,
"
continued
he
;
"
there
's
wraps
and
plenty
<EOS>
i
'
th
'
house
,
and
if
there
are
not
,
there
's
those
i
'
the
shop
as
'll
be
none
the
worse
for
once
wearing
at
such
a
time
as
this
;
and
wrap
thee
well
up
,
and
take
shawls
and
cloaks
for
them
,
and
mind
as
they
put
'em
on
.
<EOS>
Thou'll
have
to
get
out
at
a
stile
,
I
'll
tell
t
'
driver
where
;
and
thou
must
get
over
t
'
stile
and
follow
t
'
path
down
two
fields
,
and
th
'
house
is
right
before
ye
,
and
bid
'em
make
haste
and
lock
up
th
'
house
,
for
they
mun
stay
all
night
here
.
<EOS>
Kester
'll
look
after
things

"
  
<EOS>
All
this
time
Hester
was
hastily
putting
on
her
hat
and
cloak
,
which
she
had
fetched
from
the
closet
where
they
usually
hung
through
the
day
;
now
she
stood
listening
,
as
it
were
,
for
final
directions
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
suppose
they
will
not
come
,
"
said
she
;
"
they
dunnot
know
me
,
and
may
n't
believe
my
words
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
must
,
"
said
he
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"
They
do
n't
know
what
awaits
'
em
,
"
he
continued
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
thee
,
because
thou
'll
not
let
out
,
and
it
seems
as
if
I
mun
tell
some
one
 
<EOS>
it
were
such
a
shock
 
<EOS>
he
's
to
be
tried
for
's
life
.
<EOS>
They
know
not
it
's
so
serious
;
and
,
Hester
,
"
said
he
,
going
on
in
his
search
after
sympathy
,
<EOS>
"
she
's
like
as
if
she
was
bound
up
in
her
father
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
lips
quivered
as
he
looked
wistfully
into
Hester
's
face
at
these
words
.
<EOS>
No
need
to
tell
her
who
was
_
<EOS>
she
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
No
need
to
put
into
words
the
fact
,
told
plainer
than
words
could
have
spoken
it
,
that
his
heart
was
bound
up
in
Sylvia
.
  
<EOS>
Hester
's
face
,
instead
of
responding
to
his
look
,
contracted
a
little
,
and
,
for
the
life
of
her
,
she
could
not
have
helped
saying
,
    
"
Why
do
n't
yo
'
go
yourself
,
Philip
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
,
I
ca
n't
,
"
said
he
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"
I
'd
give
the
world
to
go
,
for
I
might
be
able
to
comfort
her
;
but
there
's
lawyers
to
see
,
and
iver
so
much
to
do
,
and
they
've
niver
a
man
friend
but
me
to
do
it
all
.
<EOS>
You
'll
tell
her
,
"
said
Philip
,
insinuatingly
,
as
if
a
fresh
thought
had
struck
him
,
"
as
how
I
would
ha
'
come
.
<EOS>
I
would
fain
ha
'
come
for
'em
,
myself
,
but
I
could
n't
,
because
of
th
'
lawyer
,
 
<EOS>
mind
yo
'
say
because
of
th
'
lawyer
.
<EOS>
I
'd
be
loath
for
her
to
think
I
was
minding
any
business
of
my
own
at
this
time
;
and
,
whatever
yo
'
do
,
speak
hopeful
,
and
,
for
t
'
life
of
yo
'
,
do
n't
speak
of
th
'
hanging
<EOS>
,
it
's
likely
it
's
<EOS>
a
mistake
o
'
<EOS>
Donkin
's
;
and
<EOS>
anyhow
 
there
's
t
'
cart
 
<EOS>
anyhow
<EOS>
I
should
perhaps
not
ha
'
telled
thee
,
but
it
's
a
comfort
to
make
a
clean
breast
to
a
friend
at
times
.
<EOS>
God
bless
thee
,
Hester
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
I
should
ha
'
done
without
thee
,
"
said
he
,
as
he
wrapped
her
well
up
in
the
cart
,
and
placed
the
bundles
of
cloaks
and
things
by
her
side
.
  
<EOS>
Along
the
street
,
in
the
jolting
cart
,
as
long
as
Hester
could
see
the
misty
light
streaming
out
of
the
shop
door
,
so
long
was
Philip
standing
bareheaded
in
the
rain
looking
after
her
.
<EOS>
But
she
knew
that
it
was
not
her
own
poor
self
that
attracted
his
lingering
gaze
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
thought
of
the
person
she
was
bound
to
.
    
<EOS>
A
DREARY
VIGIL
  
<EOS>
Through
the
dark
rain
,
against
the
cold
wind
,
shaken
over
the
rough
stones
,
went
Hester
in
the
little
tax
-
cart
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
kept
rising
against
her
fate
;
the
hot
tears
came
unbidden
to
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
But
rebellious
heart
was
soothed
,
and
hot
tears
were
sent
back
to
their
source
before
the
time
came
for
her
alighting
.
  
<EOS>
The
driver
turned
his
horse
in
the
narrow
lane
,
and
shouted
after
her
an
injunction
to
make
haste
as
,
with
her
head
bent
low
,
she
struggled
down
to
the
path
to
Haytersbank
Farm
.
<EOS>
She
saw
the
light
in
the
window
from
the
top
of
the
brow
,
and
involuntarily
she
slackened
her
pace
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
seen
Bell
Robson
,
and
would
Sylvia
recollect
her
?
<EOS>
If
she
did
not
how
awkward
it
would
be
to
give
the
explanation
of
who
she
was
,
and
what
her
errand
was
,
and
why
she
was
sent
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
it
must
be
done
;
so
on
she
went
,
and
standing
within
the
little
porch
,
she
knocked
faintly
at
the
door
;
but
in
the
bluster
of
the
elements
the
sound
was
lost
.
<EOS>
Again
she
knocked
,
and
now
the
murmur
of
women
's
voices
inside
was
hushed
,
and
some
one
came
quickly
to
the
door
,
and
opened
it
sharply
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
Although
her
face
was
completely
in
shadow
,
of
course
Hester
knew
her
well
;
but
she
,
if
indeed
she
would
have
recognized
Hester
less
disguised
,
did
not
know
in
the
least
who
the
woman
,
muffled
up
in
a
great
cloak
,
with
her
hat
tied
down
with
a
silk
handkerchief
,
standing
in
the
porch
at
this
time
of
night
,
could
be
.
<EOS>
Nor
,
indeed
,
was
she
in
a
mood
to
care
or
to
inquire
.
<EOS>
She
said
hastily
,
in
a
voice
rendered
hoarse
and
arid
with
grief
:
  
"
Go
away
.
<EOS>
This
is
no
house
for
strangers
to
come
to
.
<EOS>
We
've
enough
on
our
own
to
think
on
;
"
and
she
hastily
shut
the
door
in
Hester
's
face
,
before
the
latter
could
put
together
the
right
words
in
which
to
explain
her
errand
.
<EOS>
Hester
stood
outside
in
the
dark
,
wet
porch
discomfited
,
and
wondering
how
next
to
obtain
a
hearing
through
the
shut
and
bolted
door
.
<EOS>
Not
long
did
she
stand
,
however
;
some
one
was
again
at
the
door
,
talking
in
a
voice
of
distress
and
remonstrance
,
and
slowly
unbarring
the
bolts
.
<EOS>
A
tall
,
thin
figure
of
an
elderly
woman
was
seen
against
the
warm
fire
-
light
inside
as
soon
as
the
door
was
opened
;
a
hand
was
put
out
,
like
that
which
took
the
dove
into
the
ark
,
and
Hester
was
drawn
into
the
warmth
and
the
light
,
while
Bell
's
voice
went
on
speaking
to
Sylvia
before
addressing
the
dripping
stranger
    
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
a
night
to
turn
a
dog
fra
'
t
'
door
;
it
's
ill
letting
our
grief
harden
our
hearts
.
<EOS>
But
oh
!
missus
(
to
Hester
)
,
yo
'
mun
forgive
us
,
for
a
great
sorrow
<EOS>
has
fallen
upon
us
this
day
,
an
'
we
're
like
beside
ourselves
wi
'
crying
an
'
plaining
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bell
sate
down
,
and
threw
her
apron
over
her
poor
worn
face
,
as
if
decently
to
shield
the
signs
of
her
misery
from
a
stranger
's
gaze
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
,
all
tear
-
swollen
,
and
looking
askance
and
almost
fiercely
at
the
stranger
who
had
made
good
her
intrusion
,
was
drawn
,
as
it
were
,
to
her
mother
's
side
,
and
,
kneeling
down
by
her
,
put
her
arms
round
her
waist
,
and
almost
lay
across
her
lap
,
still
gazing
at
Hester
with
cold
,
distrustful
eyes
,
the
expression
of
which
repelled
and
daunted
that
poor
,
unwilling
messenger
,
and
made
her
silent
for
a
minute
or
so
after
her
entrance
.
<EOS>
Bell
suddenly
put
down
her
apron
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yo're
cold
and
drenched
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
Come
near
to
t
'
fire
and
warm
yo'rsel
'
;
yo
'
mun
pardon
us
if
we
dunnot
think
on
everything
at
onest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yo're
very
kind
,
very
kind
indeed
,
"
said
Hester
,
touched
by
the
poor
woman
's
evident
effort
to
forget
her
own
grief
in
the
duties
of
hospitality
,
and
loving
Bell
from
that
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
Hester
Rose
,
"
she
continued
,
half
addressing
Sylvia
,
who
she
thought
might
remember
the
name
,
"
and
Philip
Hepburn
has
sent
me
in
a
tax
-
cart
to
t
'
stile
yonder
,
to
fetch
both
on
yo
'
back
to
Monkshaven
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Sylvia
raised
her
head
and
looked
intently
at
Hester
.
<EOS>
Bell
clasped
her
hands
tight
together
and
leant
forwards
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
my
master
as
wants
us
?
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
in
an
eager
,
questioning
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
for
to
see
yo'r
master
,
"
said
Hester
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Philip
says
he
'll
be
sent
to
York
to
-
morrow
,
and
yo'll
be
fain
to
see
him
before
he
goes
;
and
if
yo'll
come
down
to
Monkshaven
to
-
night
,
yo'll
be
on
t
'
spot
again
'
<EOS>
the
time
comes
when
t
'
justices
will
let
ye
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bell
was
up
and
about
,
making
for
the
place
where
she
kept
her
out
-
going
things
,
almost
before
Hester
had
begun
to
speak
.
<EOS>
She
hardly
understood
about
her
husband
's
being
sent
to
York
,
in
the
possession
of
the
idea
that
she
might
go
and
see
him
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
understand
or
care
how
,
in
this
wild
night
,
she
was
to
get
to
Monkshaven
;
all
she
thought
of
was
,
that
she
might
go
and
see
her
husband
.
<EOS>
But
Sylvia
took
in
more
points
than
her
mother
,
and
,
almost
suspiciously
,
began
to
question
Hester
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
are
they
sending
him
to
York
?
<EOS>
What
made
Philip
leave
us
?
<EOS>
Why
did
n't
he
come
hissel
'
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
could
n't
come
hissel
'
,
he
bade
me
say
;
because
he
was
bound
to
be
at
the
lawyer
's
at
five
,
about
yo'r
father
's
business
.
<EOS>
I
think
yo
'
might
ha
'
known
he
would
ha
'
come
for
any
business
of
his
own
;
and
,
about
York
,
it
's
Philip
as
telled
me
,
and
I
never
asked
why
.
<EOS>
I
never
thought
on
yo'r
asking
me
so
many
questions
.
<EOS>
I
thought
yo'd
be
ready
to
fly
on
any
chance
o
'
seeing
your
father
.
"
<EOS>
Hester
spoke
out
the
sad
reproach
that
ran
from
her
heart
to
her
lips
.
<EOS>
To
distrust
Philip
!
<EOS>
to
linger
when
she
might
hasten
!
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Sylvia
,
breaking
out
into
a
wild
cry
,
that
carried
with
it
more
conviction
of
agony
than
much
weeping
could
have
done
.
<EOS>
"
I
may
be
rude
and
hard
,
and
I
may
ask
strange
questions
,
as
if
I
cared
for
t
'
<EOS>
answers
yo
<EOS>
'
may
gi
'
me
;
an
'
,
in
my
heart
o

hearts
,
I
care
for
nought
but
to
have
father
back
wi
'
us
,
as
love
him
so
dear
.
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
tell
what
I
say
,
much
less
why
I
say
it
.
<EOS>
Mother
is
so
patient
,
it
puts
me
past
mysel
'
,
for
I
could
fight
wi
'
t
<EOS>
'
very
walls
,
I
'm
so
mad
<EOS>
wi
'
grieving
.
<EOS>
Sure
,
they
'll
let
him
come
back
wi
'
us
to
-
morrow
,
when
they
hear
from
his
own
sel
'
why
he
did
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
eagerly
at
Hester
for
an
answer
to
this
last
question
,
which
she
had
put
in
a
soft
,
entreating
tone
,
as
if
with
Hester
herself
the
decision
rested
.
<EOS>
Hester
shook
her
head
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
came
up
to
her
and
took
her
hands
,
almost
fondling
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yo
'
dunnot
think
they
'll
be
hard
wi
'
him
when
they
hear
all
about
it
,
done
yo
'
?
<EOS>
Why
,
York
Castle
's
t
'
place
they
send
a
'
t
'
thieves
and
robbers
to
,
not
honest
men
like
feyther
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hester
put
her
hand
on
Sylvia
's
shoulder
with
a
soft
,
caressing
gesture
.
  
<EOS>
"
Philip
will
know
,
"
she
said
,
using
Philip
's
name
as
a
kind
of
spell
 
it
would
have
been
so
to
her
.
"
<EOS>
Come
away
to
Philip
,
"
said
she
again
,
urging
Sylvia
,
by
her
looks
and
manner
,
to
prepare
for
the
little
journey
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
moved
away
for
this
purpose
,
saying
to
herself
,
    
"
It
's
going
to
see
feyther
:
he
will
tell
me
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mrs.
Robson
was
collecting
a
few
clothes
for
her
husband
with
an
eager
,
trembling
hand
,
so
trembling
that
article
after
article
fell
to
the
floor
,
and
it
was
Hester
who
picked
them
up
;
and
at
last
,
after
many
vain
attempts
by
the
grief
-
shaken
woman
,
it
was
Hester
who
tied
the
bundle
,
and
arranged
the
cloak
,
and
fastened
down
the
hood
;
Sylvia
standing
by
,
not
unobservant
,
though
apparently
absorbed
in
her
own
thoughts
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
,
all
was
arranged
,
and
the
key
given
over
to
Kester
.
<EOS>
As
they
passed
out
into
the
storm
,
Sylvia
said
to
Hester
,
    
<EOS>
"
Thou
's
a
real
good
wench

<EOS>
Thou
's
fitter
to
be
about
mother
than
me
.
<EOS>
I
'm
but
a
cross
-
patch
at
best
,
an
'
now
it
's
like
as
if
I
was
no

"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
began
to
cry
,
but
Hester
had
no
time
to
attend
to
her
,
even
had
she
the
inclination
:
all
her
care
was
needed
to
help
the
hasty
,
tottering
steps
of
the
wife
who
was
feebly
speeding
up
the
wet
and
slippery
brow
to
her
husband
.
<EOS>
All
Bell
thought
of
was
that
"
he
"
was
at
the
end
of
her
toil
.
<EOS>
She
hardly
understood
when
she
was
to
see
him
;
her
weary
heart
and
brain
had
only
received
one
idea
 
that
each
step
she
was
now
taking
was
leading
her
to
him
.
<EOS>
Tired
and
exhausted
with
her
quick
walk
up
hill
,
battling
all
the
way
with
wind
and
rain
,
she
could
hardly
have
held
up
another
minute
when
they
reached
the
tax
-
cart
in
the
lane
,
and
Hester
had
almost
to
lift
her
on
to
the
front
seat
by
the
driver
.
<EOS>
She
covered
and
wrapped
up
the
poor
old
woman
,
and
afterwards
placed
herself
in
the
straw
at
the
back
of
the
cart
,
packed
up
close
by
the
shivering
,
weeping
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
Neither
of
them
spoke
a
word
at
first
;
but
Hester
's
tender
conscience
smote
her
for
her
silence
before
they
had
reached
Monkshaven
.
<EOS>
She
wanted
to
say
some
kind
word
to
Sylvia
,
and
yet
knew
not
how
to
begin
.
<EOS>
Somehow
,
without
knowing
why
,
or
reasoning
upon
it
,
she
hit
upon
Philip
's
message
as
the
best
comfort
in
her
power
to
give
.
<EOS>
She
had
delivered
it
before
,
but
it
had
been
apparently
little
heeded
.
  
<EOS>
"
Philip
bade
<EOS>
me
say
it
was
business
as
kept
him
from
fetchin
'
yo
'
hissel
'
 
business
wi
'
the
lawyer
,
about
 
about
yo'r
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
they
say
?
"
said
Sylvia
,
suddenly
,
lifting
her
bowed
head
,
as
though
she
would
read
her
companion
's
face
in
the
dim
light
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
dunnot
know
,
"
said
Hester
,
sadly
.
<EOS>
They
were
now
jolting
over
the
paved
streets
,
and
not
a
word
could
be
spoken
.
<EOS>
They
were
now
at
Philip
's
door
,
which
was
opened
to
receive
them
even
before
they
arrived
,
as
if
some
one
had
been
watching
and
listening
.
<EOS>
The
old
servant
,
Phoebe
,
the
fixture
in
the
house
,
who
had
belonged
to
it
and
to
the
shop
for
the
last
twenty
years
,
came
out
,
holding
a
candle
and
sheltering
it
in
her
hand
from
the
weather
,
while
Philip
helped
the
tottering
steps
of
Mrs.
Robson
as
she
descended
behind
.
<EOS>
As
Hester
had
got
in
last
,
so
she
had
now
to
be
the
first
to
move
.
<EOS>
Just
as
she
was
moving
,
Sylvia
's
cold
little
hand
was
laid
on
her
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
main
and
thankful
to
yo
'
.
<EOS>
I
ask
yo'r
pardon
for
speaking
cross
,
but
,
indeed
,
my
heart
's
a'most
broken
wi
'
fear
about
feyther
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
voice
was
so
plaintive
,
so
full
of
tears
,
that
Hester
could
not
but
yearn
towards
the
speaker
.
<EOS>
She
bent
over
and
kissed
her
cheek
,
and
then
clambered
unaided
down
by
the
wheel
on
the
dark
side
of
the
cart
.
<EOS>
Wistfully
she
longed
for
one
word
of
thanks
or
recognition
from
Philip
,
in
whose
service
she
had
performed
this
hard
task
;
but
he
was
otherwise
occupied
,
and
on
casting
a
further
glance
back
as
she
turned
the
corner
of
the
street
,
she
saw
Philip
lifting
Sylvia
carefully
down
in
his
arms
from
her
footing
on
the
top
of
the
wheel
,
and
then
they
all
went
into
the
light
and
the
warmth
,
the
door
was
shut
,
the
lightened
cart
drove
briskly
away
,
and
Hester
,
in
rain
,
and
cold
,
and
darkness
,
went
homewards
with
her
tired
sad
heart
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
had
done
all
he
could
,
since
his
return
from
lawyer
Dawson
's
,
to
make
his
house
bright
and
warm
for
the
reception
of
his
beloved
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
strong
apprehension
of
the
probable
fate
of
poor
Daniel
Robson
;
he
had
a
warm
sympathy
with
the
miserable
distress
of
the
wife
and
daughter
;
but
still
at
the
back
of
his
mind
his
spirits
danced
as
if
this
was
to
them
a
festal
occasion
.
<EOS>
He
had
even
taken
unconscious
pleasure
in
Phoebe
's
suspicious
looks
and
tones
,
as
he
had
hurried
and
superintended
her
in
her
operations
.
<EOS>
A
fire
blazed
cheerily
in
the
parlour
,
almost
dazzling
to
the
travellers
brought
in
from
the
darkness
and
the
rain
;
candles
burned
 
two
candles
,
much
to
Phoebe
's
discontent
.
<EOS>
Poor
Bell
Robson
had
to
sit
down
almost
as
soon
as
she
entered
the
room
,
so
worn
out
was
she
with
fatigue
and
excitement
;
yet
she
grudged
every
moment
which
separated
her
,
as
she
thought
,
from
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
ready
now
,
"
said
she
,
standing
up
,
and
rather
repulsing
Sylvia
's
cares
;
"
I
'm
ready
now
,
"
said
she
,
looking
eagerly
at
Philip
,
as
if
for
him
to
lead
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
to
-
night
,
"
replied
he
,
almost
apologetically
.
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
see
him
to
-
night
;
it
's
to
-
morrow
morning
before
he
goes
to
York
;
it
was
better
for
yo
'
to
be
down
here
in
town
ready
;
and
beside
I
did
n't
know
when
I
sent
for
ye
that
he
was
locked
up
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
-
a
-
day
,
well
-
a
-
day
,
"
said
Bell
,
rocking
herself
backwards
and
forwards
,
and
trying
to
soothe
herself
with
these
words
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
she
said
,
    
"
<EOS>
But
I
've
brought
his
comforter
wi
'
me
 
<EOS>
his
red
woollen
comforter
as
he
's
allays
slept
in
this
twelvemonth
past
;
he
'll
get
his
rheumatiz
again
;
<EOS>
oh
,
Philip
,
can
not
I
get
it
to
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
send
it
by
Phoebe
,
"
said
Philip
,
who
was
busy
making
tea
,
hospitable
and
awkward
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
not
I
take
it
mysel
'
?
"
repeated
Bell
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
make
surer
nor
anybody
else
;
they
'd
maybe
not
mind
yon
woman
 
Phoebe
d'ye
call
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
mother
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
"
thou
's
not
fit
to
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
go
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Philip
,
hoping
she
would
say
"
no
"
,
and
be
content
with
Phoebe
,
and
leave
him
where
he
was
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Philip
,
would
yo
'
?
"
said
Sylvia
,
turning
round
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
"
said
Bell
,
"
if
thou
would
take
it
they
'd
be
minding
yo
'
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
there
was
nothing
for
it
<EOS>
but
for
him
to
go
,
in
the
first
flush
of
his
delightful
rites
of
hospitality
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
far
,
"
said
he
,
consoling
himself
rather
than
them
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
be
back
in
ten
minutes
,
the
tea
is
maskit
,
and
Phoebe
will
take
yo'r
wet
things
and
dry
'em
by
t
'
kitchen
fire
;
and
here
's
the
stairs
,
"
opening
a
door
in
the
corner
of
the
room
,
from
which
the
stairs
immediately
ascended
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
two
rooms
at
the
top
;
that
to
t
'
left
is
all
made
ready
,
t
'
other
is
mine
,
"
said
he
,
reddening
a
little
as
he
spoke
.
<EOS>
Bell
was
busy
undoing
her
bundle
with
trembling
fingers
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
,
"
said
she
;
"
and
<EOS>
oh
,
lad
,
here
's
a
bit
o
'
peppermint
cake
;
he
's
main
and
fond
on
it
,
and
I
catched
sight
on
it
by
good
luck
<EOS>
just
t
'
last
minute
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
was
gone
,
and
the
excitement
of
Bell
and
Sylvia
flagged
once
more
,
and
sank
into
wondering
despondency
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
,
however
,
roused
herself
enough
to
take
off
her
mother
's
wet
clothes
,
and
she
took
them
timidly
into
the
kitchen
and
arranged
them
before
Phoebe
's
fire
.
  
<EOS>
Phoebe
opened
her
lips
once
or
twice
to
speak
in
remonstrance
,
and
then
,
with
an
effort
,
gulped
her
words
down
;
for
her
sympathy
,
like
that
of
all
the
rest
of
the
Monkshaven
world
,
was
in
favour
of
Daniel
Robson
;
and
his
daughter
might
place
her
dripping
cloak
this
night
wherever
she
would
,
for
Phoebe
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
found
her
mother
still
sitting
on
the
chair
next
the
door
,
where
she
had
first
placed
herself
on
entering
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
gi'e
you
some
tea
,
mother
,
"
said
she
,
struck
with
the
shrunken
look
of
Bell
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
'
said
her
mother
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
manners
for
t
'
help
oursel
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
Philip
would
ha
'
wished
yo
'
for
to
take
it
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
pouring
out
a
cup
.
  
<EOS>
Just
then
he
returned
,
and
something
in
his
look
,
some
dumb
expression
of
delight
at
her
occupation
,
made
her
blush
and
hesitate
for
an
instant
;
but
then
she
went
on
,
and
made
a
cup
of
tea
ready
,
saying
something
a
little
incoherent
all
the
time
about
her
mother
's
need
of
it
.
<EOS>
After
tea
Bell
Robson
's
weariness
became
so
extreme
,
that
Philip
and
Sylvia
urged
her
to
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
She
resisted
a
little
,
partly
out
of
"
manners
,
"
and
partly
because
she
kept
fancying
,
poor
woman
,
that
somehow
or
other
her
husband
might
send
for
her
.
<EOS>
But
about
seven
o'clock
Sylvia
persuaded
her
to
come
upstairs
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
,
too
,
bade
Philip
good
-
night
,
and
his
look
followed
the
last
wave
of
her
dress
as
she
disappeared
up
the
stairs
;
then
leaning
his
chin
on
his
hand
,
he
gazed
at
vacancy
and
thought
deeply
 
for
how
long
he
knew
not
,
so
intent
was
his
mind
on
the
chances
of
futurity
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
aroused
by
Sylvia
's
coming
down
-
stairs
into
the
sitting
-
room
again
.
<EOS>
He
started
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
is
so
shivery
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
May
I
go
in
there
,
"
indicating
the
kitchen
,
"
and
make
her
a
drop
of
gruel
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Phoebe
shall
make
it
,
not
you
,
"
said
Philip
,
eagerly
preventing
her
,
by
going
to
the
kitchen
door
and
giving
his
orders
.
<EOS>
When
he
turned
round
again
,
Sylvia
was
standing
over
the
fire
,
leaning
her
head
against
the
stone
mantel
-
piece
for
the
comparative
coolness
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
speak
at
first
,
or
take
any
notice
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
watched
her
furtively
,
and
saw
that
she
was
crying
,
the
tears
running
down
her
cheeks
,
and
she
too
much
absorbed
in
her
thoughts
to
wipe
them
away
with
her
apron
.
  
<EOS>
While
he
was
turning
over
in
his
mind
what
he
could
best
say
to
comfort
her
(
his
heart
,
like
hers
,
being
almost
too
full
for
words
)
,
she
suddenly
looked
him
full
in
the
face
,
saying
,
    
"
Philip
!
<EOS>
wo
n't
they
soon
let
him
go
?
<EOS>
what
can
they
do
to
him
?
"
<EOS>
Her
open
lips
trembled
while
awaiting
his
answer
,
the
tears
came
up
and
filled
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
It
was
just
the
question
he
had
most
dreaded
;
it
led
to
the
terror
that
possessed
his
own
mind
,
but
which
he
had
hoped
to
keep
out
of
hers
.
<EOS>
He
hesitated
.
<EOS>
"
Speak
,
lad
!
"
said
she
,
impatiently
,
with
a
little
passionate
gesture
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
see
thou
knows
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
only
made
it
worse
by
consideration
;
he
rushed
blindfold
at
a
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
ta'en
up
for
felony
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Felony
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
There
thou're
out
;
he
's
in
for
letting
yon
men
out
;
thou
may
call
it
rioting
if
thou
's
a
mind
to
set
folks
again
'
him
,
but
it
's
too
bad
to
cast
such
hard
words
at
him
as
yon
 
felony
,
"
she
repeated
,
in
a
half
-
offended
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
what
the
lawyers
call
it
,
"
said
Philip
,
sadly
;
<EOS>
"
it
's
no
word
o
'
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lawyers
is
allays
for
making
the
worst
o
'
things
,
"
said
she
,
a
little
pacified
,
"
but
folks
should
n't
allays
believe
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
lawyers
as
has
to
judge
i
'
t
'
long
run
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
not
the
justices
,
Mr.
Harter
and
them
as
is
no
lawyers
,
give
him
a
sentence
to
-
morrow
,
wi'out
sending
him
to
York
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
said
Philip
,
shaking
his
head
.
<EOS>
He
went
to
the
kitchen
door
and
asked
if
the
gruel
was
not
ready
,
so
anxious
was
he
to
stop
the
conversation
at
this
point
;
but
Phoebe
,
who
held
her
young
master
in
but
little
respect
,
scolded
him
for
a
stupid
man
,
who
thought
,
like
all
his
sex
,
that
gruel
was
to
be
made
in
a
minute
,
whatever
the
fire
was
,
and
bade
him
come
and
make
it
for
himself
if
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
to
return
discomfited
to
Sylvia
,
who
meanwhile
had
arranged
her
thoughts
ready
to
return
to
the
charge
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
say
he
's
sent
to
York
,
and
say
he
's
tried
theere
,
what
's
t
'
worst
they
can
do
again
'
him
?
"
<EOS>
asked
she
,
keeping
down
her
agitation
to
look
at
Philip
the
more
sharply
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
never
slackened
their
penetrating
gaze
at
his
countenance
,
until
he
replied
,
with
the
utmost
unwillingness
,
and
most
apparent
confusion
,
    
"
They
may
send
him
to
Botany
Bay
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
knew
that
he
held
back
a
worse
contingency
,
and
he
was
mortally
afraid
that
she
would
perceive
this
reserve
.
<EOS>
But
what
he
did
say
was
so
much
beyond
her
utmost
apprehension
,
which
had
only
reached
to
various
terms
of
imprisonment
,
that
she
did
not
imagine
the
dark
shadow
lurking
behind
.
<EOS>
What
he
had
said
was
too
much
for
her
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
dilated
,
her
lips
blanched
,
her
pale
cheeks
grew
yet
paler
.
<EOS>
After
a
minute
's
look
into
his
face
,
as
if
fascinated
by
some
horror
,
she
stumbled
backwards
into
the
chair
in
the
chimney
comer
,
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
,
moaning
out
some
inarticulate
words
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
was
on
his
knees
by
her
,
dumb
from
excess
of
sympathy
,
kissing
her
dress
,
all
unfelt
by
her
;
he
murmured
half
-
words
,
he
began
passionate
sentences
that
died
away
upon
his
lips
;
and
she
 
<EOS>
she
thought
of
nothing
but
her
father
,
and
was
possessed
and
rapt
out
of
herself
by
the
dread
of
losing
him
to
that
fearful
country
which
was
almost
like
the
grave
to
her
,
so
all
but
impassable
<EOS>
was
the
gulf
.
<EOS>
But
Philip
knew
that
it
was
possible
that
the
separation
impending
might
be
that
of
the
dark
,
mysterious
grave
 
that
the
gulf
between
the
father
and
child
might
indeed
be
that
which
no
living
,
breathing
,
warm
human
creature
can
ever
cross
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sylvie
,
Sylvie
!
"
said
he
,
 
and
all
their
conversation
had
to
be
carried
on
in
low
tones
and
whispers
,
for
fear
of
the
listening
ears
above
<EOS>
,
 
"
do
n't
,
 
do
n't
,
thou'rt
rending
my
heart
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Sylvie
,
hearken
.
<EOS>
There
's
not
a
thing
I
'll
not
do
;
there
's
not
a
penny
I
've
got
,
 
th
'
last
drop
of
blood
that
's
in
me
,
 
I
'll
give
up
my
life
for
his
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Life
,
"
said
she
,
putting
down
her
hands
,
and
looking
at
him
as
if
her
looks
could
pierce
his
soul
;
"
who
talks
o
'
touching
his
life
?
<EOS>
Thou're
going
crazy
,
Philip
,
I
think
;
"
but
she
did
not
think
so
,
although
she
would
fain
have
believed
it
.
<EOS>
In
her
keen
agony
she
read
his
thoughts
as
though
they
were
an
open
page
;
she
sate
there
,
upright
and
stony
,
the
conviction
creeping
over
her
face
like
the
grey
shadow
of
death
.
<EOS>
No
more
tears
,
no
more
trembling
,
almost
no
more
breathing
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
bear
to
see
her
,
and
yet
she
held
his
eyes
,
and
he
feared
to
make
the
effort
necessary
to
move
or
to
turn
away
,
lest
the
shunning
motion
should
carry
conviction
to
her
heart
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
conviction
of
the
probable
danger
to
her
father
's
life
was
already
there
:
it
was
that
that
was
calming
her
down
,
tightening
her
muscles
,
bracing
her
nerves
.
<EOS>
In
that
hour
she
lost
all
her
early
youth
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
he
may
be
hung
,
"
said
she
,
low
and
solemnly
,
after
a
long
pause
.
<EOS>
Philip
turned
away
his
face
,
and
did
not
utter
a
word
.
<EOS>
Again
deep
silence
,
broken
only
by
some
homely
sound
in
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
"
Mother
must
not
know
on
it
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
in
the
same
tone
in
which
she
had
spoken
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
t
'
worst
as
can
happen
to
him
,
"
said
Philip
.
<EOS>
"
More
likely
he
'll
be
transported
:
maybe
he
'll
be
brought
in
innocent
after
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
heavily
,
as
one
without
hope
 
as
if
she
were
reading
some
dreadful
doom
in
the
tablets
of
the
awful
future
.
<EOS>
"
They
'll
hang
him
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
feyther
!
<EOS>
feyther
!
<EOS>
"
she
choked
out
,
almost
stuffing
her
apron
into
her
mouth
to
deaden
the
sound
,
and
catching
at
Philip
's
hand
,
and
wringing
it
with
convulsive
force
,
till
the
pain
that
he
loved
was
nearly
more
than
he
could
bear
.
<EOS>
No
words
of
his
could
touch
such
agony
;
but
irrepressibly
,
and
as
he
would
have
done
it
to
a
wounded
child
,
he
bent
over
her
,
and
kissed
her
with
a
tender
,
trembling
kiss
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
repulse
it
,
probably
she
did
not
even
perceive
it
.
  
<EOS>
At
that
moment
Phoebe
came
in
with
the
gruel
.
<EOS>
Philip
saw
her
,
and
knew
,
in
an
instant
,
what
the
old
woman
's
conclusion
must
needs
be
;
but
Sylvia
had
to
be
shaken
by
the
now
standing
Philip
,
before
she
could
be
brought
back
to
the
least
consciousness
of
the
present
time
.
<EOS>
She
lifted
up
her
white
face
to
understand
his
words
,
then
she
rose
up
like
one
who
slowly
comes
to
the
use
of
her
limbs
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
mun
go
,
"
she
said
;
"
but
I
'd
sooner
face
the
dead
.
<EOS>
If
she
asks
me
,
Philip
,
what
mun
I
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
She
'll
not
ask
yo
'
,
"
said
he
,
"
if
yo
'
go
about
as
common
.
<EOS>
She
's
never
asked
yo
'
all
this
time
,
an
'
if
she
does
,
put
her
on
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
'll
keep
it
from
her
as
long
as
I
can
;
I
'll
manage
better
nor
I
've
done
wi
'
thee
,
Sylvie
,
"
said
he
,
with
a
sad
,
faint
smile
,
looking
with
fond
penitence
at
her
altered
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thou
must
n't
blame
thysel
'
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
seeing
his
regret
.
<EOS>
"
I
brought
it
on
me
mysel
'
;
I
thought
I
would
ha
'
t
'
truth
,
whativer

on
it
,
and
now
I
'm
not
strong
enough
to
stand

God

"
<EOS>
she
continued
,
piteously
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Sylvie
,
let
me
help
yo
'
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
do
<EOS>
what
God
can
,
 
I
'm
not
meaning
that
,
but
I
can
do
next
to
Him
of
any
man
.
<EOS>
I
have
loved
yo
'
for
years
an
'
years
,
in
a
way
it
's
terrible
to
think
on
,
if
my
love
can
do
nought
now
to
comfort
yo
'
in
your
sore
distress
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Cousin
Philip
,
"
she
replied
,
in
the
same
measured
tone
in
which
she
had
always
spoken
since
she
had
learnt
the
extent
of
her
father
's
danger
,
and
the
slow
stillness
of
her
words
was
in
harmony
with
the
stony
look
of
her
face
,
"
thou
's
a
comfort
to
me
,
I
could
n't
bide
my
life
without
thee
;
but
I
can
not
take
in
the
thought
o
'
love
,
it
seems
beside
me
quite
;
I
can
think
on
nought
but
them
that
is
quick
and
them
that
is
dead
.
"
    
<EOS>
GLOOMY
DAYS
  
<EOS>
Philip
had
money
in
the
Fosters
'
bank
,
not
so
much
as
it
might
have
been
if
he
had
not
had
to
pay
for
the
furniture
in
his
house
.
<EOS>
Much
of
this
furniture
was
old
,
and
had
belonged
to
the
brothers
Foster
,
and
they
had
let
Philip
have
it
at
a
very
reasonable
rate
;
but
still
the
purchase
of
it
had
diminished
the
amount
of
his
savings
.
<EOS>
But
on
the
sum
which
he
possessed
he
drew
largely
 
<EOS>
he
drew
all
 
nay
,
he
overdrew
his
account
somewhat
,
to
his
former
masters
'
dismay
,
although
the
kindness
of
their
hearts
overruled
the
harder
arguments
of
their
heads
.
  
<EOS>
All
was
wanted
to
defend
Daniel
Robson
at
the
approaching
York
assizes
.
<EOS>
His
wife
had
handed
over
to
Philip
all
the
money
or
money
's
worth
she
could
lay
her
hands
upon
.
<EOS>
Daniel
himself
was
not
one
to
be
much
beforehand
with
the
world
;
but
to
Bell
's
thrifty
imagination
the
round
golden
guineas
,
tied
up
in
the
old
stocking
-
foot
against
rent
-
day
,
seemed
a
mint
of
money
on
which
Philip
might
draw
infinitely
.
<EOS>
As
yet
she
did
not
comprehend
the
extent
of
her
husband
's
danger
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
went
about
like
one
in
a
dream
,
keeping
back
the
hot
tears
that
might
interfere
with
the
course
of
life
she
had
prescribed
for
herself
in
that
terrible
hour
when
she
first
learnt
all
.
<EOS>
Every
penny
of
money
either
she
or
her
mother
could
save
went
to
Philip
.
<EOS>
Kester
's
hoard
,
too
,
was
placed
in
Hepburn
's
hands
at
Sylvia
's
earnest
entreaty
;
for
Kester
had
no
great
opinion
of
Philip
's
judgment
,
and
would
rather
have
taken
his
money
straight
himself
to
Mr.
Dawson
,
and
begged
him
to
use
it
for
his
master
's
behoof
.
  
<EOS>
Indeed
,
if
anything
,
the
noiseless
breach
between
Kester
and
Philip
had
widened
of
late
.
<EOS>
It
was
seed
-
time
,
and
Philip
,
in
his
great
anxiety
for
every
possible
interest
that
might
affect
Sylvia
,
and
also
as
some
distraction
from
his
extreme
anxiety
about
her
father
,
had
taken
to
study
agriculture
of
an
evening
in
some
old
books
which
he
had
borrowed
 
_
<EOS>
The
Farmer
's
Complete
Guide
_
,
and
such
like
;
and
from
time
to
time
he
came
down
upon
the
practical
dogged
Kester
with
directions
gathered
from
the
theories
in
his
books
.
<EOS>
Of
course
the
two
fell
out
,
but
without
many
words
.
<EOS>
Kester
persevered
in
his
old
ways
,
making
light
of
Philip
and
his
books
in
manner
and
action
,
till
at
length
Philip
withdrew
from
the
contest
.
<EOS>
"
Many
a
man
may
lead
a
horse
to
water
,
but
there
's
few
can
make
him
drink
,
"
and
Philip
certainly
was
not
one
of
those
few
.
<EOS>
Kester
,
indeed
,
looked
upon
him
with
jealous
eyes
on
many
accounts
.
<EOS>
He
had
favoured
Charley
Kinraid
as
a
lover
of
Sylvia
's
;
and
though
he
had
no
idea
of
the
truth
 
though
he
believed
in
the
drowning
of
the
specksioneer
as
much
as
any
one
 
yet
the
year
which
had
elapsed
since
Kinraid
's
supposed
death
was
but
a
very
short
while
to
the
middle
-
aged
man
,
who
forgot
how
slowly
time
passes
with
the
young
;
and
he
could
often
have
scolded
Sylvia
,
if
the
poor
girl
had
been
a
whit
less
heavy
at
heart
than
she
was
,
for
letting
Philip
come
so
much
about
her
 
<EOS>
come
,
though
it
was
on
her
father
's
business
.
<EOS>
For
the
darkness
of
their
common
dread
drew
them
together
,
occasionally
to
the
comparative
exclusion
of
Bell
and
Kester
,
which
the
latter
perceived
and
resented
.
<EOS>
Kester
even
allowed
himself
to
go
so
far
as
to
wonder
what
Philip
could
want
with
all
the
money
,
which
to
him
seemed
unaccountable
;
and
once
or
twice
the
ugly
thought
crossed
his
mind
,
that
shops
conducted
by
young
men
were
often
not
so
profitable
as
when
guided
by
older
heads
,
and
that
some
of
the
coin
poured
into
Philip
's
keeping
might
have
another
destination
than
the
defence
of
his
master
.
<EOS>
Poor
Philip
!
<EOS>
and
he
was
spending
all
his
own
,
and
more
than
all
his
own
money
,
and
no
one
ever
knew
it
,
as
he
had
bound
down
his
friendly
bankers
to
secrecy
.
  
<EOS>
Once
only
Kester
ventured
to
speak
to
Sylvia
on
the
subject
of
Philip
.
<EOS>
She
had
followed
her
cousin
to
the
field
just
in
front
of
their
house
,
just
outside
the
porch
,
to
ask
him
some
question
she
dared
not
put
in
her
mother
's
presence
 
<EOS>
(
Bell
,
indeed
,
in
her
anxiety
,
usually
absorbed
all
the
questions
when
Philip
came
)
 
and
stood
,
after
Philip
had
bid
her
good
-
by
,
hardly
thinking
about
him
at
all
,
but
looking
unconsciously
after
him
as
he
ascended
the
brow
;
and
at
the
top
he
had
turned
to
take
a
last
glance
at
the
place
his
love
inhabited
,
and
,
seeing
her
,
he
had
waved
his
hat
in
gratified
farewell
.
<EOS>
She
,
meanwhile
,
was
roused
from
far
other
thoughts
than
of
him
,
and
of
his
now
acknowledged
love
,
by
the
motion
against
the
sky
,
and
was
turning
back
into
the
house
when
she
heard
Kester
's
low
hoarse
call
,
and
saw
him
standing
at
the
shippen
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
hither
,
wench
,
"
said
he
,
indignantly
;
"
is
this
a
time
for
courtin
'
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Courting
?
"
said
she
,
drawing
up
her
head
,
and
looking
back
at
him
with
proud
defiance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
courtin
'
!
<EOS>
what
other
mak
'
o
'
thing
<EOS>
is't
when
thou
's
gazin
'
after
yon
meddlesome
chap
,
as
if
thou'd
send
thy
eyes
after
him
,
and
he
making
marlocks
back
at
thee
?
<EOS>
It
's
what
we
ca'ed
courtin
'
<EOS>
i
'
my
young
days
anyhow
.
<EOS>
And
it
's
noane
a
time
for
a
wench
to
go
courtin
'
when
her
feyther
's
i
'
prison
,
"
said
he
,
with
a
consciousness
as
he
uttered
these
last
words
that
he
was
cruel
and
unjust
and
going
too
far
,
yet
carried
on
to
say
them
by
his
hot
jealousy
against
Philip
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
continued
looking
at
him
without
speaking
:
she
was
too
much
offended
for
expression
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thou
may
glower
an
'
thou
may
look
,
lass
,
"
said
he
,
"
but
a'd
thought
better
on
thee
.
<EOS>
It
's
like
last
week
thy
last
sweetheart
were
drowned
;
but
thou
's
not
one
to
waste
time
<EOS>
i
'
rememberin
'
them
as
is
gone
 
if
,
indeed
,
thou
iver
cared
a
button
for
yon
<EOS>
Kinraid
 
if
it
was
n't
a
make
-
believe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
lips
were
contracted
and
drawn
up
,
showing
her
small
glittering
teeth
,
which
were
scarcely
apart
as
she
breathed
out
    
<EOS>
"
Thou
thinks
so
,
does
thou
,
that
I
've
forgetten
_
him
_
?
<EOS>
Thou'd
<EOS>
better
have
a
care
o
'
thy
tongue
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
,
as
if
fearful
that
her
self
-
command
might
give
way
,
she
turned
into
the
house
;
and
going
through
the
kitchen
like
a
blind
person
<EOS>
,
she
went
up
to
her
now
unused
chamber
,
and
threw
herself
,
face
downwards
,
flat
on
her
bed
,
almost
smothering
herself
.
  
<EOS>
Ever
since
Daniel
's
committal
,
the
decay
that
had
imperceptibly
begun
in
his
wife
's
bodily
and
mental
strength
during
her
illness
of
the
previous
winter
,
had
been
making
quicker
progress
.
<EOS>
She
lost
her
reticence
of
speech
,
and
often
talked
to
herself
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
so
much
forethought
as
of
old
;
slight
differences
,
it
is
true
,
but
which
,
with
some
others
of
the
same
description
,
gave
foundation
for
the
homely
expression
which
some
now
applied
to
Bell
,
"
She
'll
never
be
t
'
same
woman
again
.
  
<EOS>
This
afternoon
she
had
cried
herself
to
sleep
in
her
chair
after
Philip
's
departure
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
heard
Sylvia
's
sweeping
passage
through
the
kitchen
;
but
half
an
hour
afterwards
she
was
startled
up
by
Kester
's
abrupt
entry
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
's
Sylvie
?
"
asked
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
Bell
,
looking
scared
,
and
as
if
she
was
ready
to
cry
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
no
news
about
him
?
"
said
she
,
standing
up
,
and
supporting
herself
on
the
stick
she
was
now
accustomed
to
use
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bless
yo
'
,
no
,
dunnot
be
afeared
,
missus
;
it
's
only
as
a
spoke
hasty
to
t
'
wench
,
an
'
a
want
t
'
tell
her
as
a'm
sorry
,
"
said
Kester
,
advancing
into
the
kitchen
,
and
looking
round
for
Sylvia
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sylvie
,
Sylvie
!
"
shouted
he
;
<EOS>
"
she
mun
be
i
'
t
'
house
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
came
slowly
down
the
stairs
,
and
stood
before
him
.
<EOS>
Her
face
was
pale
,
her
mouth
set
and
determined
;
the
light
of
her
eyes
veiled
in
gloom
.
<EOS>
Kester
shrank
from
her
look
,
and
even
more
from
her
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
A'm
come
to
ax
pardon
,
"
said
he
,
after
a
little
pause
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
still
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
A'm
noane
above
axing
pardon
,
though
a'm
fifty
and
more
,
and
thee
's
but
a
silly
wench
,
as
a've
nursed
i
'
my
arms
.
<EOS>
A'll
say
before
thy
mother
as
a
ought
niver
to
ha
'
used
them
words
,
and
as
how
a'm
sorry
for
'
t.
"
  
"
I
do
n't
understand
it
all
,
"
said
Bell
,
in
a
hurried
and
perplexed
tone
.
<EOS>
"
What
has
Kester
been
saying
,
my
lass
?
"
she
added
,
turning
to
Sylvia
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
went
a
step
or
two
nearer
to
her
mother
,
and
took
hold
of
her
hand
as
if
to
quieten
her
;
then
facing
once
more
round
,
she
said
deliberately
to
Kester
,
    
<EOS>
"
If
thou
was
n't
Kester
,
I
'd
niver
forgive
thee
.
<EOS>
Niver
,
"
she
added
,
with
bitterness
,
as
the
words
he
had
used
recurred
to
her
mind
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
in
me
to
hate
thee
now
,
for
saying
what
thou
did
;
but
thou're
dear
old
Kester
after
all
,
and
I
ca
n't
help
mysel
'
,
I
mun
needs
forgive
thee
,
"
and
she
went
towards
him
.
<EOS>
He
took
her
little
head
between
his
horny
hands
and
kissed
it
.
<EOS>
She
looked
up
with
tears
in
her
eyes
,
saying
softly
,
    
"
Niver
say
things
like
them
again
.
<EOS>
Niver
speak
on
   
'
  
<EOS>
"
A'll
bite
my
tongue
off
first
,
"
he
interrupted
.
  
<EOS>
He
kept
his
word
.
  
<EOS>
In
all
Philip
's
comings
and
goings
to
and
from
Haytersbank
Farm
at
this
time
,
he
never
spoke
again
of
his
love
.
<EOS>
In
look
,
words
,
manner
,
he
was
like
a
thoughtful
,
tender
brother
;
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
He
could
be
nothing
more
in
the
presence
of
the
great
dread
which
loomed
larger
upon
him
after
every
conversation
with
the
lawyer
.
  
<EOS>
For
Mr.
Donkin
had
been
right
in
his
prognostication
.
<EOS>
Government
took
up
the
attack
on
the
Rendezvous
with
a
high
and
heavy
hand
.
<EOS>
It
was
necessary
to
assert
authority
which
had
been
of
late
too
often
braved
.
<EOS>
An
example
must
be
made
,
to
strike
dismay
into
those
who
opposed
and
defied
the
press
-
gang
;
and
all
the
minor
authorities
who
held
their
powers
from
Government
were
in
a
similar
manner
severe
and
relentless
in
the
execution
of
their
duty
.
<EOS>
So
the
attorney
,
who
went
over
to
see
the
prisoner
in
York
Castle
,
told
Philip
.
<EOS>
He
added
that
Daniel
still
retained
his
pride
in
his
achievement
,
and
could
not
be
brought
to
understand
the
dangerous
position
in
which
he
was
placed
;
that
when
pressed
and
questioned
as
to
circumstances
that
might
possibly
be
used
in
his
defence
,
he
always
wandered
off
to
accounts
of
previous
outrages
committed
by
the
press
-
gang
,
or
to
passionate
abuse
of
the
trick
by
which
men
had
been
lured
from
their
homes
on
the
night
in
question
to
assist
in
putting
out
an
imaginary
fire
,
and
then
seized
and
carried
off
.
<EOS>
Some
of
this
very
natural
indignation
might
possibly
have
some
effect
on
the
jury
;
and
this
seemed
the
only
ground
of
hope
,
and
was
indeed
a
slight
one
,
as
the
judge
was
likely
to
warn
the
jury
against
allowing
their
natural
sympathy
in
such
a
case
to
divert
their
minds
from
the
real
question
.
  
<EOS>
Such
was
the
substance
of
what
Philip
heard
,
and
heard
repeatedly
,
during
his
many
visits
to
Mr.
Dawson
.
<EOS>
And
now
the
time
of
trial
drew
near
;
for
the
York
assizes
opened
on
March
the
twelfth
;
not
much
above
three
weeks
since
the
offence
was
committed
which
took
Daniel
from
his
home
and
placed
him
in
peril
of
death
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
was
glad
that
,
the
extremity
of
his
danger
never
having
been
hinted
to
Bell
,
and
travelling
some
forty
miles
being
a
most
unusual
exertion
at
that
time
to
persons
of
her
class
,
the
idea
of
going
to
see
her
husband
at
York
had
never
suggested
itself
to
Bell
's
mind
.
<EOS>
Her
increasing
feebleness
made
this
seem
a
step
only
to
be
taken
in
case
of
the
fatal
extreme
necessity
;
such
was
the
conclusion
that
both
Sylvia
and
he
had
come
to
;
and
it
was
the
knowledge
of
this
that
made
Sylvia
strangle
her
own
daily
longing
to
see
her
father
.
<EOS>
Not
but
that
her
hopes
were
stronger
than
her
fears
.
<EOS>
Philip
never
told
her
the
causes
for
despondency
;
she
was
young
,
and
she
,
like
her
father
,
could
not
understand
how
fearful
sometimes
is
the
necessity
for
prompt
and
severe
punishment
of
rebellion
against
authority
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
was
to
be
in
York
during
the
time
of
the
assizes
;
and
it
was
understood
,
almost
without
words
,
that
if
the
terrible
worst
occurred
,
the
wife
and
daughter
were
to
come
to
York
as
soon
as
might
be
.
<EOS>
For
this
end
Philip
silently
made
all
the
necessary
arrangements
before
leaving
Monkshaven
.
<EOS>
The
sympathy
of
all
men
was
with
him
;
it
was
too
large
an
occasion
for
Coulson
to
be
anything
<EOS>
but
magnanimous
.
<EOS>
He
urged
Philip
to
take
all
the
time
requisite
;
to
leave
all
business
cares
to
him
.
<EOS>
And
as
Philip
went
about
pale
and
sad
,
there
was
another
cheek
that
grew
paler
still
,
another
eye
that
filled
with
quiet
tears
as
his
heaviness
of
heart
became
more
and
more
apparent
.
<EOS>
The
day
for
opening
the
assizes
came
on
.
<EOS>
Philip
was
in
York
Minster
,
watching
the
solemn
antique
procession
in
which
the
highest
authority
in
the
county
accompanies
the
judges
to
the
House
of
the
Lord
,
to
be
there
admonished
as
to
the
nature
of
their
duties
.
<EOS>
As
Philip
listened
to
the
sermon
with
a
strained
and
beating
heart
,
his
hopes
rose
higher
than
his
fears
for
the
first
time
,
and
that
evening
he
wrote
his
first
letter
to
Sylvia
.
   
<EOS>
"
DEAR
SYLVIA
,
  
"
It
will
be
longer
first
than
I
thought
for
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Dawson
says
Tuesday
in
next
week
.
<EOS>
But
keep
up
your
heart
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
hearing
the
sermon
to
-
day
which
is
preached
to
the
judges
;
and
the
clergyman
said
so
much
in
it
about
mercy
and
forgiveness
<EOS>
,
I
think
they
can
not
fail
to
be
lenient
this
assize
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
uncle
,
who
looks
but
thin
,
but
is
in
good
heart
:
only
he
will
keep
saying
he
would
do
it
over
again
if
he
had
the
chance
,
which
neither
Mr.
Dawson
nor
I
think
is
wise
in
him
,
in
especial
as
the
gaoler
is
by
and
hears
every
word
as
is
said
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
fain
of
hearing
all
about
home
;
and
wants
you
to
rear
Daisy
's
calf
,
as
he
thinks
she
will
prove
a
good
one
.
<EOS>
He
bade
me
give
his
best
love
to
you
and
my
aunt
,
and
his
kind
duty
to
Kester
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sylvia
,
will
you
try
and
forget
how
I
used
to
scold
you
about
your
writing
and
spelling
,
and
just
write
me
two
or
three
lines
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
would
rather
have
them
badly
spelt
than
not
,
because
then
I
shall
be
sure
they
are
yours
.
<EOS>
And
never
mind
about
capitals
;
I
was
a
fool
to
say
such
a
deal
about
them
,
for
a
man
does
just
as
well
without
them
.
<EOS>
A
letter
from
you
would
do
a
vast
to
keep
me
patient
all
these
days
till
Tuesday
.

P.S.
<EOS>
The
sermon
was
grand
.
<EOS>
The
text
was
Zechariah
vii
.
<EOS>
9
,
"
Execute
true
judgment
and
show
mercy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
God
grant
it
may
have
put
mercy
into
the
judge
's
heart
as
is
to
try
my
uncle

"
   
<EOS>
Heavily
the
days
passed
over
.
<EOS>
On
Sunday
Bell
and
Sylvia
went
to
church
,
with
a
strange
,
half
-
superstitious
feeling
,
as
if
they
could
propitiate
the
Most
High
to
order
the
events
in
their
favour
by
paying
Him
the
compliment
of
attending
to
duties
in
their
time
of
sorrow
which
they
had
too
often
neglected
in
their
prosperous
days
.
  
<EOS>
But
He
"
who
knoweth
our
frame
,
and
remembereth
that
we
are
dust
,
"
took
pity
upon
His
children
,
and
sent
some
of
His
blessed
peace
into
their
hearts
,
else
they
could
scarce
have
endured
the
agony
of
suspense
of
those
next
hours
.
<EOS>
For
as
they
came
slowly
and
wearily
home
from
church
,
Sylvia
could
no
longer
bear
her
secret
,
but
told
her
mother
of
the
peril
in
which
Daniel
stood
.
<EOS>
Cold
as
the
March
wind
blew
,
they
had
not
felt
it
,
and
had
sate
down
on
a
hedge
bank
for
Bell
to
rest
.
<EOS>
And
then
Sylvia
spoke
,
trembling
and
sick
for
fear
,
yet
utterly
unable
to
keep
silence
any
longer
.
<EOS>
Bell
heaved
up
her
hands
,
and
let
them
fall
down
on
her
knees
before
she
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
Lord
is
above
us
,
"
said
she
,
solemnly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
has
sent
a
fear
<EOS>
o
'
this
into
my
heart
afore
now
.
<EOS>
I
niver
breathed
it
to
thee
,
my
lass
   
'
  
"
<EOS>
And
I
niver
spoke
on
it
to
thee
,
mother
,
because
   
'
  
Sylvia
choked
with
crying
,
and
laid
her
head
on
her
mother
's
lap
,
feeling
that
she
was
no
longer
the
strong
one
,
and
the
protector
,
but
the
protected
.
<EOS>
Bell
went
on
,
stroking
her
head
,
  
<EOS>
"
The
Lord
is
like
a
tender
nurse
as
weans
a
child
to
look
on
and
to
like
what
it
lothed
once
.
<EOS>
He
has
sent
me
dreams
as
has
prepared
me
for
this
,
if
so
be
it
comes
to
pass
.
  
<EOS>
"
Philip
is
hopeful
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
raising
her
head
and
looking
through
her
tears
at
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
he
is
.
<EOS>
And
I
can
not
tell
,
but
I
think
it
's
not
for
nought
as
the
Lord
has
ta'en
away
<EOS>
all
fear
o
'
death
out
<EOS>
o
'
my
heart
.
<EOS>
I
think
He
means
as
Daniel
and
me
is
to
go
hand
-
in
-
hand
through
the
valley
 
<EOS>
like
as
we
walked
up
to
our
wedding
in
Crosthwaite
Church
.
<EOS>
I
could
never
guide
th
'
house
without
Daniel
,
and
I
should
be
feared
he
'd
take
a
deal
more
nor
is
good
for
him
without
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
me
,
mother
,
thou
's

moaned
out

<EOS>
"
Oh

<EOS>
"
Nay

thinking

Kinraid

hanging
about

I
'll
noane

I
were
uneasylike
.
<EOS>
But
sin
'
Philip
and
thee

to

made
it
up
   
'
  
Sylvia
shivered
,
and
opened
her
mouth
to
speak
,
but
did
not
say
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
sin
'
the
Lord
has
been
comforting
me

and
talking
to

many
a
time

has
seemed

I

could
niver

living
to

folks
say

it
seems
so
unnatural
and
shameful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
mother
,
he
wo
n't
!
 
<EOS>
he
sha
n't
be
hung
!
"
said
Sylvia
,
springing
to
her
feet
.
"
<EOS>
Philip
says
he
wo
n't
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bell
shook
her
head
.
<EOS>
They
walked
on
,
Sylvia
both
disheartened
and
almost
irritated
at
her
mother
's
despondency
.
<EOS>
But
before
they
went
to
bed
at
night
Bell
said
things
which
seemed
as
though
the
morning
's
feelings
had
been
but
temporary
,
and
as
if
she
was
referring
every
decision
to
the
period
of
her
husband
's
return
.
<EOS>
"
When
father
comes
home
,
"
seemed
a
sort
of
burden
at
the
beginning
or
end
of
every
sentence
,
and
this
reliance
on
his
certain
coming
back
to
them
was
almost
as
great
a
trial
to
Sylvia
as
the
absence
of
all
hope
had
been
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
But
that
instinct
told
her
that
her
mother
was
becoming
incapable
of
argument
,
she
would
have
asked
her
why
her
views
were
so
essentially
changed
in
so
few
hours
.
<EOS>
This
inability
of
reason
in
poor
Bell
made
Sylvia
feel
very
desolate
.
  
<EOS>
Monday
passed
over
 
how
,
neither
of
them
knew
,
for
neither
spoke
of
what
was
filling
the
thoughts
of
both
.
<EOS>
Before
it
was
light
on
Tuesday
morning
,
Bell
was
astir
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
early
,
mother
,
"
said
weary
,
sleepy
Sylvia
,
dreading
returning
consciousness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
lass
!
<EOS>
"
said
Bell
,
in
a
brisk
,
cheerful
tone
;
"
but
he
'll
,
maybe
,
be
home
to
-
night
,
and
I'se
bound
to
have
all
things
ready
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Anyhow
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
sitting
up
in
bed
,
"
he
could
n't
come
home
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Tut
,
lass
!
<EOS>
thou
does
n't
know
how
quick
a
man
comes
home
to
wife
and
child
.
<EOS>
I
'll
be
a
'
ready
at
any
rate
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
hurried
about
in
a
way
which
Sylvia
wondered
to
see
;
till
at
length
she
fancied
that
perhaps
her
mother
did
so
to
drive
away
thought
.
<EOS>
Every
place
was
cleaned
;
there
was
scarce
time
allowed
for
breakfast
;
till
at
last
,
long
before
mid
-
day
,
all
the
work
was
done
,
and
the
two
sat
down
to
their
spinning
-
wheels
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
's
spirits
sank
lower
and
lower
at
each
speech
of
her
mother
's
,
from
whose
mind
all
fear
seemed
to
have
disappeared
,
leaving
only
a
strange
restless
kind
of
excitement
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
time
for
t
'
potatoes
,
"
said
Bell
,
after
her
wool
had
snapped
many
a
time
from
her
uneven
tread
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
"
it
's
but
just
gone
ten
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Put
'em
on
,
"
said
Bell
,
without
attending
to
the
full
meaning
of
her
daughter
's
words
.
<EOS>
"
It
'll
,
maybe
,
hasten
t
'
day
on
if
we
get
dinner
done
betimes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
Kester
is
in
t
'
Far
Acre
field
,
and
he
'll
not
be
home
till
noon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
seemed
to
settle
matters
for
a
while
;
but
then
Bell
pushed
her
wheel
away
,
and
began
searching
for
her
hood
and
cloak
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
found
them
for
her
,
and
then
asked
sadly
    
"
What
does
ta
want
'em
for
,
mother
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
up
t
'
brow
and
through
t
'
field
,
and
just
have
a
look
down
t
'
lane
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
wi
'
thee
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
feeling
all
the
time
the
uselessness
of
any
looking
for
intelligence
from
York
<EOS>
so
early
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
Very
patiently
did
she
wait
by
her
mother
's
side
during
the
long
half
-
hour
which
Bell
spent
in
gazing
down
the
road
for
those
who
never
came
.
  
<EOS>
When
they
got
home
Sylvia
put
the
potatoes
on
to
boil
;
but
when
dinner
was
ready
and
the
three
were
seated
at
the
dresser
,
Bell
pushed
her
plate
away
from
her
,
saying
it
was
so
long
after
dinner
time
that
she
was
past
eating
.
<EOS>
Kester
would
have
said
something
about
its
being
<EOS>
only
half
-
past
twelve
,
but
<EOS>
Sylvia
gave
him
a
look
beseeching
silence
,
and
he
went
on
with
his
dinner
without
a
word
,
only
brushing
away
the
tears
from
his
eyes
with
the
back
of
his
hand
from
time
to
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
A'll
noane
go
far
fra
<EOS>
'
home
t
'
rest
o
'
t
'
day
,
"
said
he
,
in
a
whisper
to
Sylvia
,
as
he
went
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
this
day
niver
come
to
an
end
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Bell
,
plaintively
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
mother
!
<EOS>
it
'll
come
to
an
end
some
time
,
never
fear
.
<EOS>
I
've
heerd
say
  
"
<EOS>
Be
the
day
weary
or
be
the
day
long
,
At
length
it
ringeth
to
even
-
song
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
even
-
song
 
to
even
-
song
,
"
repeated
Bell
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
D'ye
think
now
that
even
-
song
means
death
,
Sylvie
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
 
I
can
not
bear
it
.
<EOS>
Mother
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
in
despair
,
"
I
'll
make
some
clap
-
bread
<EOS>
:
that
's
a
heavy
job
,
and
will
while
away
t
'
afternoon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
do
!
<EOS>
"
replied
the
mother
.
"
<EOS>
He
'll
like
it
fresh
 
<EOS>
he
'll
like
it
fresh
.
"
  
<EOS>
Murmuring
and
talking
to
herself
<EOS>
,
she
fell
into
a
doze
,
from
which
Sylvia
was
careful
not
to
disturb
her
.
  
<EOS>
The
days
were
now
getting
long
,
although
as
cold
as
ever
;
and
at
Haytersbank
Farm
the
light
lingered
,
as
there
was
no
near
horizon
to
bring
on
early
darkness
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
had
all
ready
for
her
mother
's
tea
against
she
wakened
;
but
she
slept
on
and
on
,
the
peaceful
sleep
of
a
child
,
and
Sylvia
did
not
care
to
waken
her
.
<EOS>
Just
after
the
sun
had
set
,
she
saw
Kester
outside
the
window
making
signs
to
her
to
come
out
.
<EOS>
She
stole
out
on
tip
-
toe
by
the
back
-
kitchen
,
the
door
of
which
was
standing
open
.
<EOS>
She
almost
ran
against
Philip
,
who
did
not
perceive
her
,
as
he
was
awaiting
her
coming
the
other
way
round
the
corner
of
the
house
,
and
who
turned
upon
her
a
face
whose
import
she
read
in
an
instant
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Philip
!
<EOS>
"
was
all
she
said
,
and
then
she
fainted
at
his
feet
,
coming
down
with
a
heavy
bang
on
the
round
paving
stones
of
the
yard
.
  
<EOS>
"
Kester
!
<EOS>
Kester
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
for
she
looked
like
one
dead
,
and
with
all
his
strength
the
wearied
man
could
not
lift
her
and
carry
her
into
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
With
Kester
's
help
she
was
borne
into
the
back
-
kitchen
,
and
Kester
rushed
to
the
pump
for
some
cold
water
to
throw
over
her
.
  
<EOS>
While
Philip
,
kneeling
at
her
head
,
was
partly
supporting
her
in
his
arms
,
and
heedless
of
any
sight
or
sound
,
the
shadow
of
some
one
fell
upon
him
.
<EOS>
He
looked
up
and
saw
his
aunt
;
the
old
dignified
,
sensible
expression
on
her
face
,
exactly
like
her
former
self
,
composed
,
strong
,
and
calm
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
lass
,
"
said
she
,
sitting
down
by
Philip
,
and
gently
taking
her
out
of
his
arms
into
her
own
.
<EOS>
"
Lass
,
bear
up
!
<EOS>
we
mun
bear
up
,
and
be
agait
on
our
way
to
him
,
he
'll
be
needing
us
now
.
<EOS>
Bear
up
,
my
lass
!
<EOS>
the
Lord
will
give
us
strength
.
<EOS>
We
mun
go
to
him
;
ay
,
time
's
precious
;
thou
mun
cry
thy
cry
at
after
!
"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
opened
her
dim
eyes
,
and
heard
her
mother
's
voice
;
the
ideas
came
slowly
into
her
mind
,
and
slowly
she
rose
up
,
standing
still
,
like
one
who
has
been
stunned
,
to
regain
her
strength
;
and
then
,
taking
hold
of
her
mother
's
arm
,
she
said
,
in
a
soft
,
strange
voice
    
<EOS>
"
Let
's
go
.
<EOS>
I
'm
ready
.
"
    
<EOS>
THE
ORDEAL
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
afternoon
of
an
April
day
in
that
same
year
,
and
the
sky
was
blue
above
,
with
little
sailing
white
clouds
catching
the
pleasant
sunlight
.
<EOS>
The
earth
in
that
northern
country
had
scarcely
yet
put
on
her
robe
of
green
.
<EOS>
The
few
trees
grew
near
brooks
running
down
from
the
moors
and
the
higher
ground
.
<EOS>
The
air
was
full
of
pleasant
sounds
prophesying
of
the
coming
summer
.
<EOS>
The
rush
,
and
murmur
,
and
tinkle
of
the
hidden
watercourses
;
the
song
of
the
lark
poised
high
up
in
the
sunny
air
;
the
bleat
of
the
lambs
calling
to
their
mothers
 
everything
inanimate
was
full
of
hope
and
gladness
.
  
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
for
a
mournful
month
the
front
door
of
Haytersbank
Farm
was
open
;
the
warm
spring
air
might
enter
,
and
displace
the
sad
dark
gloom
,
if
it
could
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
newly
-
lighted
fire
in
the
unused
grate
;
and
Kester
was
in
the
kitchen
,
with
his
clogs
off
his
feet
,
so
as
not
to
dirty
the
spotless
floor
,
stirring
here
and
there
,
and
trying
in
his
awkward
way
to
make
things
look
home
-
like
and
cheerful
.
<EOS>
He
had
brought
in
some
wild
daffodils
which
he
had
been
to
seek
in
the
dawn
,
and
he
placed
them
in
a
jug
on
the
dresser
.
<EOS>
Dolly
Reid
,
the
woman
who
had
come
to
help
Sylvia
during
her
mother
's
illness
a
year
ago
,
was
attending
to
something
in
the
back
-
kitchen
,
making
a
noise
among
the
milk
-
cans
,
and
singing
a
ballad
to
herself
as
she
worked
;
yet
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
she
checked
herself
in
her
singing
,
as
if
a
sudden
recollection
came
upon
her
that
this
was
neither
the
time
nor
the
place
for
songs
.
<EOS>
Once
or
twice
she
took
up
the
funeral
psalm
which
is
sung
by
the
bearers
of
the
body
in
that
country
    
Our
God
,
our
help
in
ages
past
.
  
<EOS>
But
it
was
of
no
use
:
<EOS>
the
pleasant
April
weather
out
of
doors
,
and
perhaps
the
natural
spring
in
the
body
,
disposed
her
nature
to
cheerfulness
,
and
insensibly
she
returned
to
her
old
ditty
.
  
<EOS>
Kester
was
turning
over
many
things
in
his
rude
honest
mind
as
he
stood
there
,
giving
his
finishing
touches
every
now
and
then
to
the
aspect
of
the
house
-
place
,
in
preparation
for
the
return
of
the
widow
and
daughter
of
his
old
master
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
month
and
more
since
they
had
left
home
;
more
than
a
fortnight
since
Kester
,
with
three
halfpence
in
his
pocket
,
had
set
out
after
his
day
's
work
to
go
to
York
 
to
walk
all
night
long
,
and
to
wish
Daniel
Robson
his
last
farewell
.
  
<EOS>
Daniel
had
tried
to
keep
up
and
had
brought
out
one
or
two
familiar
,
thread
-
bare
,
well
-
worn
jokes
,
such
as
he
had
made
Kester
chuckle
over
many
a
time
and
oft
,
when
the
two
had
been
together
afield
or
in
the
shippen
at
the
home
which
he
should
never
more
see
.
<EOS>
But
no
"
Old
Grouse
in
the
gunroom
"
could
make
Kester
smile
,
or
do
anything
except
groan
in
but
a
heart
-
broken
sort
of
fashion
,
and
presently
the
talk
had
become
more
suitable
to
the
occasion
,
Daniel
being
up
to
the
last
the
more
composed
of
the
two
;
for
Kester
,
when
turned
out
of
the
condemned
cell
,
fairly
broke
down
into
the
heavy
sobbing
he
had
never
thought
to
sob
again
on
earth
.
<EOS>
He
had
left
Bell
and
Sylvia
in
their
lodging
at
York
,
under
Philip
's
care
;
he
dared
not
go
to
see
them
;
he
could
not
trust
himself
;
he
had
sent
them
his
duty
,
and
bade
Philip
tell
Sylvia
that
the
game
-
hen
had
brought
out
fifteen
chickens
at
a
hatch
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
although
Kester
sent
this
message
through
Philip
 
although
he
saw
and
recognized
all
that
Philip
was
doing
in
their
behalf
,
in
the
behalf
of
Daniel
Robson
,
the
condemned
felon
,
his
honoured
master
 
<EOS>
he
liked
Hepburn
not
a
whit
better
than
he
had
done
before
all
this
sorrow
<EOS>
had
come
upon
them
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
had
,
perhaps
,
shown
a
want
of
tact
in
his
conduct
to
Kester
.
<EOS>
Acute
with
passionate
keenness
in
one
direction
,
he
had
a
sort
of
dull
straightforwardness
in
all
others
.
<EOS>
For
instance
,
he
had
returned
Kester
the
money
which
the
latter
had
so
gladly
advanced
towards
the
expenses
incurred
in
defending
Daniel
.
<EOS>
Now
the
money
which
Philip
gave
him
back
was
part
of
an
advance
which
Foster
Brothers
had
made
on
Philip
's
own
account
.
<EOS>
Philip
had
thought
that
it
was
hard
on
Kester
to
lose
his
savings
in
a
hopeless
cause
,
and
had
made
a
point
of
repaying
the
old
man
;
but
Kester
would
far
rather
have
felt
that
the
earnings
of
the
sweat
of
his
brow
had
gone
in
the
attempt
to
save
his
master
's
life
than
have
had
twice
ten
times
as
many
golden
guineas
.
  
<EOS>
Moreover
,
it
seemed
to
take
his
action
in
lending
his
hoard
out
of
the
sphere
of
love
,
and
make
it
but
a
leaden
common
loan
,
when
it
was
Philip
who
brought
him
the
sum
,
not
Sylvia
,
into
whose
hands
he
had
given
it
.
  
<EOS>
With
these
feelings
Kester
felt
his
heart
shut
up
as
he
saw
the
long
-
watched
-
for
two
coming
down
the
little
path
with
a
third
person
;
with
Philip
holding
up
the
failing
steps
of
poor
Bell
Robson
,
as
,
loaded
with
her
heavy
mourning
,
and
feeble
from
the
illness
which
had
detained
her
in
York
ever
since
the
day
of
her
husband
's
execution
,
she
came
faltering
back
to
her
desolate
home
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
was
also
occupied
in
attending
to
her
mother
;
one
or
twice
,
when
they
paused
a
little
,
she
and
Philip
spoke
,
in
the
familiar
way
in
which
there
is
no
coyness
nor
reserve
.
<EOS>
Kester
caught
up
his
clogs
,
and
went
quickly
out
through
the
back
-
kitchen
into
the
farm
-
yard
,
not
staying
to
greet
them
,
as
he
had
meant
to
do
;
and
yet
it
was
dull
-
sighted
of
him
not
to
have
perceived
that
whatever
might
be
the
relations
between
Philip
and
Sylvia
,
he
was
sure
to
have
accompanied
them
home
;
for
,
alas
!
<EOS>
he
was
the
only
male
protector
of
their
blood
remaining
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
Poor
Kester
,
who
would
fain
have
taken
that
office
upon
himself
,
chose
to
esteem
himself
cast
off
,
and
went
heavily
about
the
farmyard
,
knowing
that
he
ought
to
go
in
and
bid
such
poor
welcome
as
he
had
to
offer
,
yet
feeling
too
much
to
like
to
show
himself
before
Philip
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
long
,
too
,
before
any
one
had
leisure
to
come
and
seek
him
.
<EOS>
Bell
's
mind
had
flashed
up
for
a
time
,
till
the
fatal
day
,
only
to
be
reduced
by
her
subsequent
illness
into
complete
and
hopeless
childishness
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
Philip
and
Sylvia
could
do
to
manage
her
in
the
first
excitement
of
returning
home
;
her
restless
inquiry
for
him
who
would
never
more
be
present
in
the
familiar
scene
,
her
feverish
weariness
and
uneasiness
,
all
required
tender
soothing
and
most
patient
endurance
of
her
refusals
to
be
satisfied
with
what
they
said
or
did
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
she
took
some
food
,
and
,
refreshed
by
it
,
and
warmed
by
the
fire
,
she
sank
asleep
in
her
chair
.
<EOS>
Then
Philip
would
fain
have
spoken
with
Sylvia
before
the
hour
came
at
which
he
must
return
to
Monkshaven
,
but
she
eluded
him
,
and
went
in
search
of
Kester
,
whose
presence
she
had
missed
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
guessed
some
of
the
causes
which
kept
him
from
greeting
them
on
their
first
return
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
as
if
she
had
shaped
these
causes
into
the
definite
form
of
words
.
<EOS>
It
is
astonishing
to
look
back
and
find
how
differently
constituted
were
the
minds
of
most
people
fifty
or
sixty
years
ago
<EOS>
;
they
felt
,
they
understood
,
without
going
through
reasoning
or
analytic
processes
,
and
if
this
was
the
case
among
the
more
educated
people
,
of
course
it
was
still
more
so
in
the
class
to
which
Sylvia
belonged
.
<EOS>
She
knew
by
some
sort
of
intuition
that
if
Philip
accompanied
them
home
(
as
,
indeed
,
under
the
circumstances
,
was
so
natural
as
to
be
almost
unavoidable
)
,
the
old
servant
and
friend
of
the
family
would
absent
himself
;
and
so
she
slipped
away
at
the
first
possible
moment
to
go
in
search
of
him
.
<EOS>
There
he
was
in
the
farm
-
yard
,
leaning
over
the
gate
that
opened
into
the
home
-
field
,
apparently
watching
the
poultry
that
scratched
and
pecked
at
the
new
-
springing
grass
with
the
utmost
relish
.
<EOS>
A
little
farther
off
were
the
ewes
with
their
new
-
dropped
lambs
,
beyond
that
the
great
old
thorn
-
tree
with
its
round
fresh
clusters
of
buds
,
again
beyond
that
there
was
a
glimpse
of
the
vast
sunny
rippling
sea
;
but
Sylvia
knew
well
that
Kester
was
looking
at
none
of
these
things
.
<EOS>
She
went
up
to
him
and
touched
his
arm
.
<EOS>
He
started
from
his
reverie
,
and
turned
round
upon
her
with
his
dim
eyes
full
of
unshed
tears
.
<EOS>
When
he
saw
her
black
dress
,
her
deep
mourning
,
he
had
hard
work
to
keep
from
breaking
out
,
but
by
dint
of
a
good
brush
of
his
eyes
with
the
back
of
his
hand
,
and
a
moment
's
pause
,
he
could
look
at
her
again
with
tolerable
calmness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Kester
:
why
didst
niver
come
to
speak
to
us
?
"
said
Sylvia
,
finding
it
necessary
to
be
cheerful
if
she
could
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
dun
know
;
niver
ax
me
.
<EOS>
A
say
,
<EOS>
they'n
gi'en
Dick
Simpson
"
(
whose
evidence
had
been
all
material
against
poor
Daniel
Robson
at
the
trial
)
"
<EOS>
a
'
t
'
rotten
eggs
and
fou
'
things
<EOS>
they
could

o
'
Saturday
,
they
did
,
"
continued
he
,
in
a
tone
of
satisfaction
;
"
ay
,
and
they
niver
stopped
t
'
see
whether
t
'
eggs
were
rotten
or
fresh
when
their
blood
was
up
 
nor
whether
stones
was
hard
or
soft
,
"
he
added
,
in
a
lower
tone
,
and
chuckling
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
was
silent
.
<EOS>
He
looked
at
her
now
,
chuckling
still
.
<EOS>
Her
face
was
white
,
her
lips
tightened
,
her
eyes
a
-
flame
.
<EOS>
She
drew
a
long
breath
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
'd
been
theere
!
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
do
him
an
ill
turn
,
"
sighed
she
,
with
some
kind
of
expression
on
her
face
that
made
Kester
quail
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
lass
!
<EOS>
he
'll
get
it
fra
'
others
.
<EOS>
Niver

thysel
'
about

<EOS>
A'n
done
ill
to
speak
on
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No

<EOS>
Then
as
was
<EOS>
friends
o
'
father
's
I
'll
love
for
iver
and
iver
;
them
as
helped
for

'
hang
him
'
<EOS>
(
she
shuddered
from
head
to
foot
 
a
sharp
irrepressible
shudder
!
)
<EOS>
"
I
'll
niver
forgive
 
niver
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Niver
's
a
long
word
,
"
said
Kester
,
musingly
.
<EOS>
"
A
could
horsewhip
him
,
or
cast
stones
at
him
,
or
duck
him
mysel
'
;
but
,
lass

<EOS>
niver

"
  
<EOS>
"
Well

<EOS>
niver

if
it
is
 
<EOS>
it
's
me
as
said
it
,
and
I
'm
turned
savage
late
days
.
<EOS>
Come
in
,
Kester
,
and
see
poor
mother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
can
not
,
"
said
he
,
turning
his
wrinkled
puckered
face
away
,
that
she
might
not
see
the
twitchings
of
emotion
on
it
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
kine
to
be
fetched
up
,
and
what
not
,
and
he
's
theere
,
is
n't
he
,
Sylvie
?
"
facing
round
upon
her
with
inquisitiveness
.
<EOS>
Under
his
peering
eyes
she
reddened
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
if
it
's
<EOS>
Philip
thou
means
;
he
's
been
all
we
've
had
to
look

.
"
<EOS>
Again
the
shudder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
now
he
'll
be
seein
'
after
his
shop
,
a
reckon
?
"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
was
calling
to
the
old
mare
nibbling
tufts
of
early
-
springing
grass
here
and
there
,
and
half
unconsciously
coaxing
the
creature
to
come
up
to
the
gate
to
be
stroked
.
<EOS>
But
she
heard
Kester
's
words
well
enough
,
and
so
he
saw
,
although
she
made
this
excuse
not
to
reply
.
<EOS>
But
Kester
was
not
to
be
put
off
.
  
<EOS>
"
Folks
is
talkin
'
about
thee
and
him
;
thou'll
ha
'
to
mind
lest
thee
and
him
gets
yo'r
names
coupled
together
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
right
down
cruel
on
folks
,
then
,
"
said
she
,
crimsoning
from
some
emotion
.
<EOS>
"
As
if
any
man
as
was
a
man
would
n't
do
all
he
could
for
two
lone
women
at
such
a
time
 
<EOS>
and
he
a
cousin
,
too
!
<EOS>
Tell
me
who
said
so
,
"
continued
she
,
firing
round
at
Kester
,
"
and
I
'll
niver
forgive
'em
 
<EOS>
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hoots
!
<EOS>
"
said
Kester
,
a
little
conscious
that
he
himself
was
the
principal
representative
of
that
name
of
multitude
folk
.
<EOS>
"
Here
's
a
pretty
lass
;
she
's
'
got
"
a'll
niver
forgi'e
"
at
her
tongue
's
end
wi
'
a
vengeance
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
was
a
little
confused
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Kester
,
man
,
"
said
she
,
"
my
heart
is
sore
again
'
every
one
,
for
feyther
's
sake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
at
length
the
natural
relief
of
plentiful
tears
came
;
and
Kester
,
with
instinctive
wisdom
,
let
her
weep
undisturbed
;
indeed
,
he
cried
not
a
little
himself
.
<EOS>
They
were
interrupted
by
Philip
's
voice
from
the
back
-
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sylvie
,
your
mother
's
awake
,
and
wants
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Kester
,
come
,
"
and
taking
hold
of
him
<EOS>
she
drew
him
with
her
into
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Bell
rose
as
they
came
in
,
holding
by
the
arms
of
the
chair
.
<EOS>
At
first
she
received
Kester
as
though
he
had
been
a
stranger
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
glad
to
see
yo
'
,
sir
;
t
'
master
's
out
,
but
he
'll
be
in
afore
long

<EOS>
It
'll
be
about

lambs
yo're
come

mebbe

<EOS>
"
  
"
Mother

"
said
Sylvia
,
"
dunnot
yo

<EOS>
it
's
Kester
,
 
Kester
,
wi
'
his
Sunday
clothes
on

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Kester
!
<EOS>
ay
,
sure
it
is
;
my
eyes
have
getten
so
sore
and
dim
of
late
;
just
as
if
I
'd
been
greeting
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
,
lad
,
I
'm
glad
to
see
thee
!
<EOS>
It
's
a
long
time
I
've
been
away
,
but
it
were
not
pleasure
-
seeking
as
took
me
,
it
were
<EOS>
business
o
<EOS>
'
some
mak
'
 
tell
him
,
Sylvie
,
what
it
were
,
for
my
head
's
clean
gone
.
<EOS>
I
only
know
I
would
n't
ha
'
left
home
if
I
could
ha
'
helped
it
;
for
I
think
I
should
ha
'
kept
my
health
better
if
I
'd
bided
at
home
wi
'
my
master
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
as
he
's
not
comed
in
for
t
'
bid
me
welcome
?
<EOS>
Is
he
far
afield
,
think
ye
,
Kester
?
"
  
<EOS>
Kester
looked
at
Sylvia
,
mutely
imploring
her
to
help
him
out
in
the
dilemma
of
answering
,
but
she
was
doing
all
she
could
to
help
crying
.
<EOS>
Philip
came
to
the
rescue
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aunt
,
"
said
he
,
"
the
clock
has
stopped
;
can
you
tell
me
where
t
'
find
t
'
key
,
and
I
'll
wind
it
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
T
'
key
,
"
said
she
,
hurriedly
,
"
t
'
key
,
it
's
behind
th
'
big
Bible
on
yon
shelf
.
<EOS>
But
I
'd
rayther
thou
would
n't
touch
it
,
lad
;
it
's
t
'
master
's
work
,
and
he
distrusts
folk
meddling
wi
'
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Day
after
day
there
was
this
constant
reference
to
her
dead
husband
.
<EOS>
In
one
sense
it
was
a
blessing
;
all
the
circumstances
attendant
on
his
sad
and
untimely
end
were
swept
out
of
her
mind
along
with
the
recollection
of
the
fact
itself
.
<EOS>
She
referred
to
him
as
absent
,
and
had
always
some
plausible
way
of
accounting
for
it
,
which
satisfied
her
own
mind
;
and
,
accordingly
they
fell
into
the
habit
of
humouring
her
,
and
speaking
of
him
as
gone
to
Monkshaven
,
or
afield
,
or
wearied
out
,
and
taking
a
nap
upstairs
,
as
her
fancy
led
her
to
believe
for
the
moment
.
<EOS>
But
this
forgetfulness
,
though
happy
for
herself
,
was
terrible
for
her
child
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
constant
renewing
of
Sylvia
's
grief
,
while
her
mother
could
give
her
no
sympathy
,
no
help
,
or
strength
in
any
circumstances
that
arose
out
of
this
grief
.
<EOS>
She
was
driven
more
and
more
upon
Philip
;
his
advice
and
his
affection
became
daily
more
necessary
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
Kester
saw
what
would
be
the
end
of
all
this
more
clearly
than
Sylvia
did
herself
;
and
,
impotent
to
hinder
what
he
feared
and
disliked
,
he
grew
more
and
more
surly
every
day
.
<EOS>
Yet
he
tried
to
labour
hard
and
well
for
the
interests
of
the
family
,
as
if
they
were
bound
up
in
his
good
management
of
the
cattle
and
land
.
<EOS>
He
was
out
and
about
by
the
earliest
dawn
,
working
all
day
long
with
might
and
main
.
<EOS>
He
bought
himself
a
pair
of
new
spectacles
,
which
might
,
he
fancied
,
enable
him
to
read
the
_
Farmer
's
Complete
Guide
_
,
his
dead
master
's
_
vade
-
mecum
_
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
never
learnt
more
than
his
capital
letters
,
and
had
forgotten
many
of
them
;
so
the
spectacles
did
him
but
little
good
.
<EOS>
Then
he
would
take
the
book
to
Sylvia
,
and
ask
her
to
read
to
him
the
instructions
he
needed
;
<EOS>
instructions
,
be
it
noted
,
that
he
would
formerly
have
despised
as
mere
book
-
learning
:
but
his
present
sense
of
responsibility
had
made
him
humble
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
would
find
the
place
with
all
deliberation
:
and
putting
her
finger
under
the
line
to
keep
the
exact
place
of
the
word
she
was
reading
,
she
would
strive
in
good
earnest
to
read
out
the
directions
given
;
but
when
every
fourth
word
had
to
be
spelt
,
it
was
rather
hopeless
work
,
especially
as
all
these
words
were
unintelligible
to
the
open
-
mouthed
listener
,
however
intent
he
might
be
.
<EOS>
He
had
generally
to
fall
back
on
his
own
experience
;
and
,
guided
by
that
,
things
were
not
doing
badly
in
his
estimation
,
when
,
one
day
,
Sylvia
said
to
him
,
as
they
were
in
the
hay
-
field
,
heaping
up
the
hay
into
cocks
with
Dolly

Kester
 
<EOS>
I
did
n't
tell
thee
 
there
were
a
letter
from
Measter
Hall
,
Lord
Malton
's
steward
,
<EOS>
that
came
last
night
and
that
Philip
read
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
stopped
for
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
lass
!
<EOS>
Philip
read
it
thee
,
and
whatten
might
it
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Only
that
he
had
an
offer
for
Haytersbank
Farm
,
and
would
set
mother
free
to
go
as
soon
as
t
'
crops
was
off
t
'
ground
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
sighed
a
little
as
she
said
this
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
Only
!
"
sayst
ta
?
<EOS>
Whatten
business
has
he
for
to
go
an
'
offer
to
let
t
'
farm
afore
iver
he
were
told
as
yo
'
wished
to
leave
it
?
"
<EOS>
observed
Kester
,
in
high
dudgeon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
replied
Sylvia
,
throwing
down
her
rake
,
as
if
weary
of
life
.
<EOS>
"
What
could
we
do
wi
'
t
'
farm
and
land
?
<EOS>
If
it
were
all
dairy
I
might
ha
'
done
,
but
wi
'
so
much
on
it
arable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
if
'
tis
arable
is
not
I
allays
to
t
'
fore
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
man
,
dunnot
find
fault
<EOS>
wi
'
me
!
<EOS>
I
'm
just
fain
to
lie
down
and
die
,
if
it
were
not
for
mother
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ay
!
<EOS>
thy
mother
will
be
sore
unsettled
if
thou
's
for
quitting
Haytersbank
,
"
said
merciless
Kester
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
help
it
;
I
can
not
help
it
!
<EOS>
What
can
I
do
?
<EOS>
It
would
take
two
pair
o
'
men
's
hands
to
keep
t
'
land
up
as
Measter
Hall
likes
it
;
and
beside
   
'
  
"
<EOS>
Beside
what
?
<EOS>
"
said
Kester
,
looking
up
at
her
with
his
sudden
odd
look
,
one
eye
shut
,
the
other
open
<EOS>
:
there
she
stood
,
her
two
hands
clasped
tight
together
,
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
,
her
face
pale
and
sad
.
"
<EOS>
Beside
what
?
"
he
asked
again
,
sharply
.
  
<EOS>
"
T
'
answer
's
sent
to
Measter
Hall
 
<EOS>
Philip
wrote
it
last
night
;
so
there
's
no
use
planning
and
fretting
,
it
were
done
for
t
'
best
,
and
mun
be
done
.
"
<EOS>
She
stooped
and
picked
up
her
rake
,
and
began
tossing
the
hay
with
energy
,
the
tears
streaming
down
her
cheeks
unheeded
.
<EOS>
It
was
Kester
's
turn
to
throw
down
his
rake
.
<EOS>
She
took
no
notice
,
he
did
not
feel
sure
that
she
had
observed
his
action
.
<EOS>
He
began
to
walk
towards
the
field
-
gate
;
this
movement
did
catch
her
eye
,
for
in
a
minute
<EOS>
her
hand
was
on
his
arm
,
and
she
was
stooping
forward
to
look
into
his
face
.
<EOS>
It
was
working
and
twitching
with
emotion
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Kester
!
<EOS>
oh
,
man
!
<EOS>
speak
out
,
but
dunnot
leave
me
a
this

<EOS>
What
could
I
ha

done
?
<EOS>
Mother
is
gone
dateless
wi

and
I
am
but
a
young

I

,
sooner
than
had
thee
turned
out

"
said
Kester
,
in
a
low
voice
;
then
working
himself
up
into
a
passion
,
as
a
new
suspicion
crossed
his
mind
,
he
added
,
"
<EOS>
An
'
what
for
did
n't
yo

tell
me
on

<EOS>
Yo

<EOS>
"
  
"
Measter
Hall
had
sent
a
notice
to
quit
on
Midsummer
day
;
but
Philip
had
answered
it
hisself
.
<EOS>
Thou
knows
I
'm
not
good
at
reading
writing
,
"
special
when
a
letter
's
full
o
'
long
words
,
and
Philip
had
ta'en
it
in
hand
to
answer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wi'out
asking
thee
?
"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
went
on
without
minding
the
interruption
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
Measter
Hall
makes
a
good
offer
,
for
t

man

Furniture

"
said
Kester
,
in
grim
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
What
's
to
come
o
'
t
'
missus
and
thee
,
that
yo'll
not

on

"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
reddened
,
but
kept
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
not
yo
'
speak
?
"
  
"
Oh
,
Kester
,
I
did
n't
think
thou'd
turn
again
'
me
,
and
me
so
friendless
.
<EOS>
It
's
as
if
I
'd
been
doin'
something
wrong
,
and
I
have
so
striven
to
act
<EOS>
as
is
best
;
there
's
mother
as
well
as
me
to
be
thought
on

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
not
yo
'
answer
a
question
?
"
said
Kester
,
once
more
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Whatten
's
up
that
t
'
missus
and
yo'll
not

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
'm
going
to
marry
Philip
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
in
so
low
a
tone
,
that
if
Kester
had
not
suspected
what
her
answer
was
to
be
,
he
could
not
have
understood
it
.
  
<EOS>
After
a
moment
's
pause
he
recommenced
his
walk
towards
the
field
-
gate
.
<EOS>
But
she
went
after
him
and
held
him
tight
by
the
arm
,
speaking
rapidly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Kester
,
what
could
I
do
?
<EOS>
What
can
I
do
?
<EOS>
He
's
my
cousin
,
and
mother
knows
him
,
and
likes
him
;
and
he
's
been
so
good
to
us
in
a
'
<EOS>
this
time
o
'
trouble
and
heavy
grief
,
and
he
'll
keep
mother
in
comfort
all
t
'
rest
of
her
days
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ay
,
and
thee
in
comfort
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
deal
in
a
well
-
filled
purse
in
a
wench
's
eyes
,
or
one
would
ha

thought
it
were
n't
so
easy

as

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Kester
,
Kester
,
"
she
cried
,
"
I
've
niver
forgotten
Charley
;
I
think
on
him
,
I
see
him
ivery
night
lying
drowned

bottom

t

sea
.
<EOS>
Forgetten
him
!
<EOS>
Man
!
<EOS>
it
's
easy
talking
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
was
like
a
wild
creature
that
sees
its
young
,
but
is
unable
to
reach
it
without
a
deadly
spring
,
and
yet
is
preparing
to
take
that
fatal
leap
.
<EOS>
Kester
himself
was
almost
startled
,
and
yet
it
was
as
if
he
must
go
on
torturing
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
An
'
who
telled
thee
<EOS>
so
sure
and
certain
as
he
were
drowned
?
<EOS>
He
might
ha
'
been
carried
off
by
t

press

gang
as
well
as
other
men

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
if
I
were
but
dead
that
I
might
know
all

"
<EOS>
cried
she
,
flinging
herself
down
on
the
hay
.
  
<EOS>
Kester
kept
silence
.
<EOS>
Then
she
sprang
up
again
,
and
looking
with
eager
wistfulness
into
his
face
<EOS>
,
she
said
,
    
"
Tell
me
t
'
chances

<EOS>
Tell
me
quick

<EOS>
Philip
's
very
good

kind

and
he
says
he
shall
die
if
I
will
not
marry
him
,
and
there
's
no

for

me

<EOS>
no

for

for

if

me

as
for

Kester

it

just

only
one

thousand

ta'en
by

gang

<EOS>
"
She
was
breathless
by
this
time
,
what
with
her
hurried
words
,
and
what
with
the
beating
of
her
heart
.
<EOS>
Kester
took
time
to
answer
.
<EOS>
He
had
spoken
before
too
hastily
,
this
time
he
weighed
his
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
Kinraid
went
away
from
this
here
<EOS>
place
t
'
join
his
ship
.
<EOS>
An

he
niver
joined

an

t

an

all

what

<EOS>
Then
on

other
there
's
this
as
is
known

<EOS>
His
hat
were
cast
up
by
t

sea
wi

a
ribbon
in
it
,
as
there
's
reason
<EOS>
t

so
quick
if

<EOS>
He
did
not
say
any
more
,
but
turned
back
into
the
field
,
and
took
up
his
hay
-
making
again
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
stood
quite
still
,
thinking
,
and
wistfully
longing
for
some
kind
of
certainty

Kester
came
up
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sylvie

"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
began
to
cry
as
if
her
heart
was
broken
.
<EOS>
She
had
promised
herself
more
fully
to
Philip
the
night
before
than
she
had
told
Kester
;
and
,
with
some
pains
and
much
patience
,
her
cousin
,
her
lover
,
alas
!
<EOS>
her
future
husband
,
had
made
the
fact
clear
to
the
bewildered
mind
of
her
poor
mother
,
who
had
all
day
long
shown
that
her
mind
and
heart
were
full
of
the
subject
,
and
that
the
contemplation
of
it
was
giving
her
as
much
peace
as
she
could
ever
know
.
<EOS>
And
now
Kester
's
words
came
to
call
up
echoes
in
the
poor
girl
's
heart
.
<EOS>
Just
as
she
was
in
this
miserable
state
,
wishing
that
the
grave
lay
open
before
her
,
and
that
she
could
lie
down
,
and
be
covered
up
by
the
soft
green
turf
from
all
the
bitter
sorrows
and
carking
cares
and
weary
bewilderments
of
this
life
;
wishing
that
her
father
was
alive
,
that
Charley
was
once
more
here
;
that
she
had
not
repeated
the
solemn
words
by
which
she
had
promised
herself
to
Philip
only
the
very
evening
before
,
she
heard
a
soft
,
low
whistle
,
and
,
looking
round
unconsciously
,
there
was
her
lover
and
affianced
husband
,
leaning
on
the
gate
,
and
gazing
into
the
field
with
passionate
eyes
,
devouring
the
fair
face
and
figure
of
her
,
his
future
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Kester
,
"
said
she
once
more
,
"
what
mun
I
do
?
<EOS>
I
'm
pledged
to
him
as
strong
as
words
can
make
it
,
and
mother
blessed
us
both
wi

more
sense
than
she
's
had
for
weeks

Kester

Shall

all
off

Nay

<EOS>
Again
that
long
,
cooing
whistle
.
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
He
's
been
very
kind
to

said
Sylvia
,
laying
her
rake
down
with
slow
care
,

I
'll

happy

<EOS>
WEDDING
RAIMENT
  
<EOS>
Philip
and
Sylvia
were
engaged
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
so
happy
a
state
of
things
as
Philip
had
imagined
.
<EOS>
He
had
already
found
that
out
,
although
it
was
not
twenty
-
four
hours
since
Sylvia
had
promised
to
be
his
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
defined
why
he
was
dissatisfied
;
if
he
had
been
compelled
to
account
for
his
feeling
,
he
would
probably
have
alleged
as
a
reason
that
Sylvia
's
manner
was
so
unchanged
by
her
new
position
towards
him
.
<EOS>
She
was
quiet
and
gentle
;
but
no
shyer
,
no
brighter
,
no
coyer
,
no
happier
,
than
she
had
been
for
months
before
.
<EOS>
When
she
joined
him
at
the
field
-
gate
,
his
heart
was
beating
fast
,
his
eyes
were
beaming
out
love
at
her
approach
.
<EOS>
She
neither
blushed
nor
smiled
,
but
seemed
absorbed
in
thought
of
some
kind
.
<EOS>
But
she
resisted
his
silent
effort
to
draw
her
away
from
the
path
leading
to
the
house
,
and
turned
her
face
steadily
homewards
.
<EOS>
He
murmured
soft
words
,
which
she
scarcely
heard
.
<EOS>
Right
in
their
way
was
the
stone
trough
for
the
fresh
bubbling
water
,
that
,
issuing
from
a
roadside
spring
,
served
for
all
the
household
purposes
of
Haytersbank
Farm
.
<EOS>
By
it
were
the
milk
-
cans
,
glittering
and
clean
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
knew
she
should
have
to
stop
for
these
,
and
carry
them
back
home
in
readiness
for
the
evening
's
milking
;
and
at
this
time
,
during
this
action
,
she
resolved
to
say
what
was
on
her
mind
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
there
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
Philip
,
Kester
has
been
saying
as
how
it
might
ha
'
been
   
'
  
"
<EOS>
Well
!
"
said
Philip
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
sate
down
on
the
edge
of
the
trough
,
and
dipped
her
hot
little
hand
in
the
water
.
<EOS>
Then
she
went
on
quickly
,
and
lifting
her
beautiful
eyes
to
Philip
's
face
,
with
a
look
of
inquiry
 
<EOS>
"
He
thinks
as
Charley
Kinraid
may
ha
'
been
took
by
t
'
press
-
gang
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
first
time
she
had
named
the
name
of
her
former
lover
to
her
present
one
since
the
day
,
long
ago
now
,
when
they
had
quarrelled
about
him
;
and
the
rosy
colour
flushed
her
all
over
;
but
her
sweet
,
trustful
eyes
never
flinched
from
their
steady
,
unconscious
gaze
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
's
heart
stopped
beating
;
literally
,
as
if
he
had
come
to
a
sudden
precipice
,
while
he
had
thought
himself
securely
walking
on
sunny
greensward
.
<EOS>
He
went
purple
all
over
from
dismay
;
he
dared
not
take
his
eyes
away
from
that
sad
,
earnest
look
of
hers
,
but
he
was
thankful
that
a
mist
came
before
them
and
drew
a
veil
before
his
brain
.
<EOS>
He
heard
his
own
voice
saying
words
he
did
not
seem
to
have
framed
in
his
own
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
Kester
's
a
d
 
d
fool
,
"
he
growled
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
says
there
's
mebbe
but
one
chance
i
'
a
hundred
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
pleading
,
as
it
were
,
for
Kester
;
"
<EOS>
but
oh
!
<EOS>
Philip
,
think
yo
'
<EOS>
there
's
just
that
one
chance
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
there
's
a
chance
,
sure
enough
,
"
said
Philip
,
in
a
kind
of
fierce
despair
that
made
him
reckless
what
he
said
or
did
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
chance
,
I
suppose
,
for
iverything
i
'
life
as
we
have
not
seen
with
our
own
eyes
as
it
may
not
ha
'
happened
.
<EOS>
Kester
may
say
next
as
there
's
a
chance
as
your
father
is
not
dead
,
because
we
none
on
us
saw
him
   
<EOS>
'
  
"
Hung
,
"
he
was
going
to
have
said
,
but
a
touch
of
humanity
came
back
into
his
stony
heart
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
sent
up
a
little
sharp
cry
at
his
words
.
<EOS>
He
longed
at
the
sound
to
take
her
in
his
arms
and
hush
her
up
,
as
a
mother
hushes
her
weeping
child
.
<EOS>
But
the
very
longing
,
having
to
be
repressed
,
only
made
him
more
beside
himself
with
guilt
,
anxiety
,
and
rage
.
<EOS>
They
were
quite
still
now
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
looking
sadly
down
into
the
bubbling
,
merry
,
flowing
water
:
<EOS>
Philip
glaring
at
her
,
wishing
that
the
next
word
were
spoken
,
though
it
might
stab
him
to
the
heart
.
<EOS>
But
she
did
not
speak
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
,
unable
to
bear
it
any
longer
,
he
said
,
"
Thou
sets
a
deal
o
'
store
on
that
man
,
Sylvie
.
"
  
<EOS>
If
"
that
man
"
had
been
there
at
the
moment
,
Philip
would
have
grappled
with
him
,
and
not
let
go
his
hold
till
one
or
the
other
were
dead
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
caught
some
of
the
passionate
meaning
of
the
gloomy
,
miserable
tone
of
Philip
's
voice
as
he
said
these
words
.
<EOS>
She
looked
up
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
yo
'
knowed
that
I
cared
a
deal
for
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
something
so
pleading
and
innocent
in
her
pale
,
troubled
face
,
so
pathetic
in
her
tone
,
that
Philip
's
anger
,
which
had
been
excited
against
her
,
as
well
as
against
all
the
rest
of
the
world
,
melted
away
into
love
;
and
once
more
he
felt
that
have
her
for
his
own
<EOS>
he
must
,
at
any
cost
.
<EOS>
He
sate
down
by
her
,
and
spoke
to
her
in
quite
a
different
manner
to
that
which
he
had
used
before
,
with
a
ready
tact
and
art
which
some
strange
instinct
or
tempter
"
close
at
his
ear
"
supplied
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
darling
,
I
knew
yo
'
cared
for
him
.
<EOS>
I
'll
not
say
ill
of
him
that
is
 
<EOS>
dead
 
ay
,
dead
and
drowned
 
whativer
<EOS>
Kester
may
say
 
before
now
;
but
if
I
chose
I
could
tell
tales
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
tell
no
tales
;
I
'll
not
hear
them
,
"
said
she
,
wrenching
herself
out
of
Philip
's
clasping
arm
.
<EOS>
"
They
may
misca
'
him
for
iver
,
and
I
'll
not
believe
'
em
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
niver
miscall
one
who
is
dead
,
"
said
Philip
;
each
new
unconscious
sign
of
the
strength
of
Sylvia
's
love
for
her
former
lover
only
making
him
the
more
anxious
to
convince
her
that
he
was
dead
,
only
rendering
him
more
keen
at
deceiving
his
own
conscience
by
repeating
to
it
the
lie
that
long
ere
this
Kinraid
was
in
all
probability
dead
 
killed
by
either
the
chances
of
war
or
tempestuous
sea
;
that
,
even
if
not
,
he
was
as
good
as
dead
to
her
;
so
that
the
word
"
dead
"
might
be
used
in
all
honest
certainty
,
as
in
one
of
its
meanings
Kinraid
was
dead
for
sure
.
  
<EOS>
"
Think
yo
'
that
if
he
were
not
dead
he
would
n't
ha
'
written
ere
this
to
some
one
of
his
kin
,
if
not
to
thee
?
<EOS>
Yet
none
of
his
folk
Newcassel
-
way
but
believe
him
dead
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
Kester
says
,
"
sighed
Sylvia
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
took
heart
.
<EOS>
He
put
his
arm
softly
round
her
again
,
and
murmured
    
"
My
lassie
,
try
not
to
think
on
them
as
is
gone
,
as
is
dead
,
but
t
'
think
a
bit
more
on
him
as
loves
yo
'
wi
'
heart
,
and
soul
,
and
might
,
and
has
done
iver
sin
'
<EOS>
he
first
set
eyes
on
yo
'
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Sylvie
,
my
love
for
thee
is
just
terrible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
At
this
moment
Dolly
Reid
was
seen
at
the
back
-
door
of
the
farmhouse
,
and
catching
sight
of
Sylvia
,
she
called
out
    
"
Sylvia
,
thy
mother
is
axing
for
thee
,
and
I
can
not
make
her
mind
easy
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
a
moment
Sylvia
had
sprung
up
from
her
seat
,
and
was
running
in
to
soothe
and
comfort
her
mother
's
troubled
fancies
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
sate
on
by
the
well
-
side
,
his
face
buried
in
his
two
hands
.
<EOS>
Presently
he
lifted
himself
up
,
drank
some
water
eagerly
out
of
his
hollowed
palm
,
sighed
,
and
shook
himself
,
and
followed
his
cousin
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
he
came
unexpectedly
to
the
limits
of
his
influence
over
her
.
<EOS>
In
general
she
obeyed
his
expressed
wishes
with
gentle
indifference
,
as
if
she
had
no
preferences
of
her
own
;
once
or
twice
he
found
that
she
was
doing
what
he
desired
out
of
the
spirit
of
obedience
,
which
,
as
her
mother
's
daughter
,
she
believed
to
be
her
duty
towards
her
affianced
husband
.
<EOS>
And
this
last
motive
for
action
depressed
her
lover
more
than
anything
.
<EOS>
He
wanted
the
old
Sylvia
back
again
;
captious
,
capricious
,
wilful
,
haughty
,
merry
,
charming
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
that
Sylvia
was
gone
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
But
once
especially
his
power
,
arising
from
whatever
cause
,
was
stopped
entirely
short
 
<EOS>
was
utterly
of
no
avail
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
on
the
occasion
of
Dick
Simpson
's
mortal
illness
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
and
her
mother
kept
aloof
from
every
one
.
<EOS>
They
had
never
been
intimate
with
any
family
but
the
Corneys
,
and
even
this
friendship
had
considerably
cooled
since
Molly
's
marriage
,
and
most
especially
since
Kinraid
's
supposed
death
,
when
Bessy
Corney
and
Sylvia
had
been
,
as
it
were
,
rival
mourners
.
<EOS>
But
many
people
,
both
in
Monkshaven
and
the
country
round
about
,
held
the
Robson
family
in
great
respect
,
although
Mrs.
Robson
herself
was
accounted
"
high
"
and
"
distant
;
"
and
poor
little
Sylvia
,
in
her
heyday
of
beautiful
youth
and
high
spirits
,
had
been
spoken
of
as
'
a
bit
flighty
,
"
and
'
a
set
-
up
lassie
.
"
<EOS>
Still
,
when
their
great
sorrow
fell
upon
them
,
there
were
plenty
of
friends
to
sympathize
deeply
with
them
;
and
,
as
Daniel
had
suffered
in
a
popular
cause
,
there
were
even
more
who
,
scarcely
knowing
them
personally
,
were
ready
to
give
them
all
the
marks
of
respect
and
friendly
feeling
in
their
power
.
<EOS>
But
neither
Bell
nor
Sylvia
were
aware
of
this
.
<EOS>
The
former
had
lost
all
perception
of
what
was
not
immediately
before
her
;
the
latter
shrank
from
all
encounters
of
any
kind
with
a
sore
heart
,
and
sensitive
avoidance
of
everything
that
could
make
her
a
subject
of
remark
.
<EOS>
So
the
poor
afflicted
people
at
Haytersbank
knew
little
of
Monkshaven
news
.
<EOS>
What
little
did
come
to
their
ears
came
through
Dolly
Reid
,
when
she
returned
from
selling
the
farm
produce
of
the
week
;
and
often
,
indeed
,
even
then
she
found
Sylvia
too
much
absorbed
in
other
cares
or
thoughts
to
listen
to
her
gossip
.
<EOS>
So
no
one
had
ever
named
that
Simpson
was
supposed
to
be
dying
till
Philip
began
on
the
subject
one
evening
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
's
face
suddenly
flashed
into
glow
and
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
dying
,
is
he
?
<EOS>
t
'
earth
is
well
rid
on
such
a
fellow
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
Sylvie
,
that
's
a
hard
speech
o
'
thine
!
"
<EOS>
said
Philip
;
<EOS>
"
it
gives
me
but
poor
heart
to
ask
a
favour
of
thee
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
it
's
aught
about
Simpson
,
"
replied
she
,
and
then
she
interrupted
herself
.
"
<EOS>
But
say
on
;
it
were
ill
-
mannered
in
me
for
t
'
interrupt
yo
'
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thou
would
be
sorry
to
see
him
,
I
think
,
Sylvie
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
get
over
the
way
,
t
'
folk
met
him
,
and
pelted
him
when
he
came
back
<EOS>
fra
'
York
,
 
<EOS>
and
he
's
weak
and
faint
,
and
beside
himself
at
times
;
and
he
'll
lie
a
dreaming
,
and
a
-
fancying
they
're
all
at
him
again
,
hooting
,
and
yelling
,
and
pelting
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
glad
on
'
t
,
"
said
Sylvia
;
"
it
's
t
'
best
news
I
've
heered
for
many
a
day
,
 
he
,
to
turn
again
'
feyther
,
who
gave
him
money
fo
<EOS>
t
'
get
a
lodging
that
night
,
when
he
'd
no
place
to
go
to
.
<EOS>
It
were
his
evidence
as
hung
feyther
;
and
he
's
rightly
punished
for
it
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
a
'
that
,
 
and
he
's
done
a
vast
o
'
wrong
beside
,
he
's
dying
now
,
Sylvie
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
!
let
him
die
 
<EOS>
it
's
t
'
best
thing
he
could
do
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
's
lying
i
'
such
dree
poverty
,
 
and
niver
a
friend
to
go
near
him
,
 
niver
a
person
to
speak
a
kind
word
t
'
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
seems
as
yo've
been
speaking
wi
'
him
,
at
any
rate
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
turning
round
on
Philip
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
.
<EOS>
He
sent
for
me
by
Nell
Manning
,
th
'
old
beggar
-
woman
,
who
sometimes
goes
in
and
makes
his
bed
for
him
,
poor
wretch
,
 
<EOS>
he
's
lying
in
t
'
ruins
of
th
'
cow
-
house
of
th
'
Mariners
'
Arms
,
Sylvie
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
!
"
said
she
,
in
the
same
hard
,
dry
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
went
and
fetched
th
'
parish
doctor
,
for
I
thought
he
'd
ha
'
died
before
my
face
,
 
he
was
so
wan
,
and
ashen
-
grey
,
so
thin
,
too
,
his
eyes
seem
pushed
out
of
his
bony
face
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
last
time
 
feyther
's
eyes
were
starting
,
wild
-
like
,
and
as
if
he
could
n't
meet
ours
,
or
bear
the
sight
on
our
weeping
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
bad
look
-
out
for
Philip
's
purpose
;
but
after
a
pause
he
went
bravely
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
poor
dying
creature
,
anyhow
.
<EOS>
T
'
doctor
said
so
,
and
told
him
he
had
n't
many
hours
,

to

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
'd
shrink
fra
'
dying
wi
'
a
'
his
sins
on
his
head
?
"
said
Sylvia
,
almost
exultingly
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
shook
his
head
.
"
<EOS>
He
said
this
world
had
been
too
strong
for
him
,
and
men
too
hard
upon
him
;
he
could
niver
do
any
good
here
,
and
he
thought
he
should
,
maybe
,
find
folks
<EOS>
i
'
t
'
<EOS>
next
place
more
merciful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
'll
meet
feyther
theere
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
still
hard
and
bitter
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
poor
ignorant
creature
,
and
does
n't
seem
to
know
rightly
who
he
's
like
to
meet
;
only
he
seems
glad
to
get
away
fra
<EOS>
'
Monkshaven
folks
;
he
were
really
hurt
,
I
am
afeared
,
that
night
,
Sylvie
,
 
and
<EOS>
he
speaks
as
if
he
'd
had
hard
times
of
it
ever
since
he
were
a
child
,
 
and
he
talks
as
if
he
were
really
grieved
for
<EOS>
t
'
part
t
'
lawyers
made
him
take
at
th
'
trial
,
 
they
made
him
speak
,
against
his
will
,
he
says
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Could
n't
he
ha
'
bitten
his
tongue
out
?
"
asked
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
fine
talking
o
'
sorrow
when
the
thing
is
done
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
anyhow
he
's
sorry
now
;
and
he
's
not
long
for
to
live
.
<EOS>
And
,
Sylvie
,
he
bid
me
ask
thee
,
if
,
for
the
sake
of
all
that
is
dear
to
thee
both
here
,
and
i
'
th
'
world
to
come
,
thou'd
<EOS>
go
wi
'
me
,
and
just
say
to
him
that
thou
forgives
him
his
part
that
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
sent
thee
on
that
errand
,
did
he
?
<EOS>
And
thou
could
come
and
ask
me
?
<EOS>
I
've
a
mind
to
break
it
off
for
iver
wi
'
thee
,
Philip
.
<EOS>
"
She
kept
gasping
,
as
if
she
could
not
say
any
more
.
<EOS>
Philip
watched
and
waited
till
her
breath
came
,
his
own
half
choked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thee
and
me
was
niver
meant
to
go
together
.
<EOS>
It
's
not
in
me
to
forgive
,
 
I
sometimes
think
it
's
not
in
me
to
forget
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
,
Philip
,
if
thy
feyther
had
done
a
kind
deed
 
and
a
right
deed
 
and
a
merciful
deed
 
and
some
one
as
he
'd
been
good
to
,
even
i
'
t
'
midst
of
his
just
anger
,
had
gone
and
let
on
about
him
to
th
'
judge
,
as
was
trying
to
hang
him
,
 
and
had
getten
him
hanged
,
 
<EOS>
hanged
dead
,
so
that
his
wife
were
a
widow
,
and
<EOS>
his
child
fatherless
for
ivermore
<EOS>
,
 
I
wonder
if
thy
veins
would
run
milk
and
water
,
so
that
thou
could
go
and
make
friends
,
and
speak
soft
wi
'
him
as
had
caused
thy
feyther
's
death
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
said
in
t
'
Bible
,
Sylvie
,
that
we
're
to
forgive
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
there
's
some
things
as
I
know
I
niver
forgive
;
and
there
's
others
as
I
ca
n't
 
<EOS>
and
I
wo
n't
,
either
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
,
Sylvie
,
yo
'
pray
to
be
forgiven
your
trespasses
,
as
you
forgive
them
as
trespass
against
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
if
I
'm
to
be
taken
at
my
word
,
I
'll
noane
pray
at
all
,
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
It
's
well
enough
for
them
as
has
but
little
to
forgive
to
use
them
words
;
and
I
do
n't
reckon
it
's
kind
,
or
pretty
behaved
in
yo
'
,
Philip
,
to
bring
up
Scripture
again
'
me
.
<EOS>
Thou
may
go
about
thy
business
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Thou'rt
vexed
with
me
,
Sylvie
;
and
I
'm
not
meaning
but
that
it
would
go
hard
with
thee
to
forgive
him
;
but
I
think
it
would
be
right
and
Christian
-
like
<EOS>
i
'
thee
,
and
that
thou'd
find
thy
comfort
in
thinking
on
it
after
.
<EOS>
If
thou'd
only
go
,
and
see
his
wistful
eyes
 
<EOS>
I
think
they
'd
plead
wi
'
thee
more
than
his
words
,
or
mine
either
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
thee
my
flesh
and
blood
was
n't
made
for
forgiving
and
forgetting
.
<EOS>
Once
for
all
,
thou
must
take
my
word
.
<EOS>
When
I
love
I
love
,
and
when
I
hate
I
hate
;
and
him
as
has
done
hard
to
me
,
or
to
mine
,
I
may
keep
fra
'
striking
or
murdering
,
but
I
'll
niver
forgive
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
just
a
monster
,
fit
to
be
shown
at
a
fair
,
if
I
could
forgive
him
as
got
feyther
hanged
.
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
was
silent
,
thinking
what
more
he
could
urge
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yo'd
better
be
off
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
in
a
minute
or
two
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yo
'
and
me
has
got
wrong
,
and
it
'll
take
a
night
's
sleep
to
set
us
right
.
<EOS>
Yo've
said
all
yo
'
can
for
him
;
and
perhaps
it
's
not
yo
'
as
is
to
blame
,
but
<EOS>
yo'r
nature
.
<EOS>
But
I
'm
put
out
wi
'
thee
,
and
want
thee
out
o
'
my
sight
for
awhile
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
One
or
two
more
speeches
of
this
kind
convinced
him
that
it
would
be
wise
in
him
to
take
her
at
her
word
.
<EOS>
He
went
back
to
Simpson
,
and
found
him
,
though
still
alive
,
past
the
understanding
of
any
words
of
human
forgiveness
.
<EOS>
Philip
had
almost
wished
he
had
not
troubled
or
irritated
Sylvia
by
urging
the
dying
man
's
request
:
the
performance
of
this
duty
seemed
now
to
have
been
such
a
useless
office
.
  
<EOS>
After
all
,
the
performance
of
a
duty
is
never
a
useless
office
,
though
we
may
not
see
the
consequences
,
or
they
may
be
quite
different
to
what
we
expected
or
calculated
on
.
<EOS>
In
the
pause
of
active
work
,
when
daylight
was
done
,
and
the
evening
shades
came
on
,
Sylvia
had
time
to
think
;
and
her
heart
grew
sad
and
soft
,
in
comparison
to
what
it
had
been
when
Philip
's
urgency
had
called
out
all
her
angry
opposition
.
<EOS>
She
thought
of
her
father
 
his
sharp
passions
,
his
frequent
forgiveness
,
or
rather
his
forgetfulness
that
he
had
even
been
injured
.
<EOS>
All
Sylvia
's
persistent
or
enduring
qualities
were
derived
from
her
mother
,
her
impulses
from
her
father
.
<EOS>
It
was
her
dead
father
whose
example
filled
her
mind
this
evening
in
the
soft
and
tender
twilight
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
say
to
herself
that
she
would
go
and
tell
Simpson
that
she
forgave
him
;
but
she
thought
that
if
Philip
asked
her
again
that
she
should
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
But
when
she
saw
Philip
again
he
told
her
that
Simpson
was
dead
;
and
passed
on
from
what
he
had
reason
to
think
would
be
an
unpleasant
subject
to
her
.
<EOS>
Thus
he
never
learnt
how
her
conduct
might
have
been
more
gentle
and
relenting
than
her
words
 
words
which
came
up
into
his
memory
at
a
future
time
,
with
full
measure
of
miserable
significance
.
  
<EOS>
In
general
,
Sylvia
was
gentle
and
good
enough
;
but
Philip
wanted
her
to
be
shy
and
tender
with
him
,
and
this
she
was
not
.
<EOS>
She
spoke
to
him
,
her
pretty
eyes
looking
straight
and
composedly
at
him
.
<EOS>
She
consulted
him
like
the
family
friend
that
he
was
:
she
met
him
quietly
in
all
the
arrangements
for
the
time
of
their
marriage
,
which
she
looked
upon
more
as
a
change
of
home
,
as
the
leaving
of
Haytersbank
,
as
it
would
affect
her
mother
,
than
in
any
more
directly
personal
way
.
<EOS>
Philip
was
beginning
to
feel
,
though
not
as
yet
to
acknowledge
,
that
the
fruit
he
had
so
inordinately
longed
for
was
but
of
the
nature
of
an
apple
of
Sodom
.
  
<EOS>
Long
ago
,
lodging
in
widow
Rose
's
garret
,
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
watching
some
pigeons
that
were
kept
by
a
neighbour
;
the
flock
disported
themselves
on
the
steep
tiled
roofs
just
opposite
to
the
attic
window
,
and
insensibly
Philip
grew
to
know
their
ways
,
and
one
pretty
,
soft
little
dove
was
somehow
perpetually
associated
in
his
mind
with
his
idea
of
his
cousin
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
The
pigeon
would
sit
in
one
particular
place
,
sunning
herself
,
and
puffing
out
her
feathered
breast
,
with
all
the
blue
and
rose
-
coloured
lights
gleaming
in
the
morning
rays
,
cooing
softly
to
herself
as
she
dressed
her
plumage
.
<EOS>
Philip
fancied
that
he
saw
the
same
colours
in
a
certain
piece
of
shot
silk
 
now
in
the
shop
;
and
none
other
seemed
to
him
so
suitable
for
his
darling
's
wedding
-
dress
.
<EOS>
He
carried
enough
to
make
a
gown
,
and
gave
it
to
her
one
evening
,
as
she
sate
on
the
grass
just
outside
the
house
,
half
attending
to
her
mother
,
half
engaged
in
knitting
stockings
for
her
scanty
marriage
outfit
.
<EOS>
He
was
glad
that
the
sun
was
not
gone
down
,
thus
allowing
him
to
display
the
changing
colours
in
fuller
light
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
admired
it
duly
;
even
Mrs.
Robson
was
pleased
and
attracted
by
the
soft
yet
brilliant
hues
.
<EOS>
Philip
whispered
to
Sylvia
 
(
he
took
delight
in
whispers
,
 
<EOS>
she
,
on
the
contrary
,
always
spoke
to
him
in
her
usual
tone
of
voice
)
    
<EOS>
"
Thou'lt
look
so
pretty
in
it
,
sweetheart
,
 
o
'
Thursday
fortnight
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thursday
fortnight
.
<EOS>
On
the
fourth
yo're
thinking
on
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
not
wear
it
then
,
 
I
shall
be
i
'
black
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
on
that
day
,
sure
!
"
said
Philip
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
<EOS>
There
's
nought
t
'
happen
on
that
day
for
t
'
<EOS>
make
me
forget
feyther
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
put
off
my
black
,
Philip
,
 
no
,
not
to
save
my
life
!
<EOS>
Yon
silk
is
just
lovely
,
far
too
good
for
the
likes
of
me
,
 
and
I
'm
sure
I
'm
much
beholden
to
yo
'
;
and
I
'll
have
it
made
up
first
of
any
gown
after
last
April
<EOS>
come
two
years
,
 
but
,
oh
,
<EOS>
Philip
,
I
can
not
put
off
my
mourning
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
for
our
wedding
-
day
!
"
said
Philip
,
sadly
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
lad
,
I
really
can
not
.
<EOS>
I
'm
just
sorry
about
it
,
for
I
see
thou'rt
set
upon
it
;
and
thou'rt
so
kind
and
good
<EOS>
,
I
sometimes
think
I
can
niver
be
thankful
enough
to
thee
.
<EOS>
When
I
think
on
what
would
ha
'
become
of
mother
and
me
if
we
had
n't
had
thee
for
a
friend
<EOS>
i
'
need
,
I
'm
noane
ungrateful
,
Philip
;
tho
'
<EOS>
I
sometimes
fancy
<EOS>
thou'rt
thinking
I
am
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
yo
'
to
be
grateful
,
Sylvie
,
"
said
poor
Philip
,
dissatisfied
,
yet
unable
to
explain
what
he
did
want
;
<EOS>
only
knowing
that
there
was
something
he
lacked
,
yet
fain
would
have
had
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
marriage
-
day
drew
near
,
all
Sylvia
's
care
seemed
to
be
for
her
mother
;
all
her
anxiety
was
regarding
the
appurtenances
of
the
home
she
was
leaving
.
<EOS>
In
vain
Philip
tried
to
interest
her
in
details
of
his
improvements
or
contrivances
in
the
new
home
to
which
he
was
going
to
take
her
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
tell
him
;
but
the
idea
of
the
house
behind
the
shop
was
associated
in
her
mind
with
two
times
of
discomfort
and
misery
.
<EOS>
The
first
time
she
had
gone
into
the
parlour
about
which
Philip
spoke
so
much
was
at
the
time
of
the
press
-
gang
riot
,
when
she
had
fainted
from
terror
and
excitement
;
the
second
was
on
that
night
of
misery
when
she
and
her
mother
had
gone
in
to
Monkshaven
,
to
bid
her
father
farewell
before
he
was
taken
to
York
;
in
that
room
,
on
that
night
,
she
had
first
learnt
something
of
the
fatal
peril
in
which
he
stood
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
show
the
bright
shy
curiosity
about
her
future
dwelling
that
is
common
enough
with
girls
who
are
going
to
be
married
.
<EOS>
All
she
could
do
was
to
restrain
herself
from
sighing
,
and
listen
patiently
,
when
he
talked
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
In
time
he
saw
that
she
shrank
from
it
;
so
he
held
his
peace
,
and
planned
and
worked
for
her
in
silence
,
 
smiling
to
himself
as
he
looked
on
each
completed
arrangement
for
her
pleasure
or
comfort
;
and
knowing
well
that
her
happiness
was
involved
in
what
fragments
of
peace
and
material
comfort
might
remain
to
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
The
wedding
-
day
drew
near
apace
.
<EOS>
It
was
Philip
's
plan
that
after
they
had
been
married
in
Kirk
Moorside
church
,
he
and
his
Sylvia
,
his
cousin
,
his
love
,
his
wife
,
should
go
for
the
day
to
Robin
Hood
's
Bay
,
returning
in
the
evening
to
the
house
behind
the
shop
in
the
market
-
place
.
<EOS>
There
they
were
to
find
Bell
Robson
installed
in
her
future
home
;
for
Haytersbank
Farm
was
to
be
given
up
to
the
new
tenant
on
the
very
day
of
the
wedding
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
would
not
be
married
any
sooner
;
she
said
that
she
must
stay
there
till
the
very
last
;
and
had
said
it
with
such
determination
that
Philip
had
desisted
from
all
urgency
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
told
her
that
all
should
be
settled
for
her
mother
's
comfort
during
their
few
hours
'
absence
;
otherwise
Sylvia
would
not
have
gone
at
all
.
<EOS>
He
told
her
he
should
ask
Hester
,
who
was
always
so
good
and
kind
 
who
never
yet
had
said
him
nay
,
to
go
to
church
with
them
as
bridesmaid
 
for
Sylvia
would
give
no
thought
or
care
to
anything
but
her
mother
 
and
that
they
would
leave
her
at
Haytersbank
as
they
returned
from
church
;
she
would
manage
Mrs
Robson
's
removal
 
<EOS>
she
would
do
this
 
<EOS>
do
that
 
do
everything
.
<EOS>
Such
friendly
confidence
had
Philip
in
Hester
's
willingness
and
tender
skill
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
acquiesced
at
length
,
and
Philip
took
upon
himself
to
speak
to
Hester
on
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hester
,
"
said
he
,
one
day
when
he
was
preparing
to
go
home
after
the
shop
was
closed
;
"
would
yo
'
mind
stopping
a
bit
?
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
show
yo
'
the
place
<EOS>
now
it
's
done
up
;
and
I
've
a
favour
to
ask
on
yo
'
besides
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
was
so
happy
he
did
not
see
her
shiver
all
over
.
<EOS>
She
hesitated
just
a
moment
before
she
answered
,
    
<EOS>
"
I
'll
stay
,
if
thou
wishes
it
,
Philip
.
<EOS>
But
I
'm
no
judge
o
'
fashions
and
such
like
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thou'rt
a
judge
o
'
comfort
,
and
that
's
what
I
've
been
aiming
at
.
<EOS>
I
were
niver
so
comfortable
in
a
'
my
life
as
when
I
were
a
lodger
at
thy
house
,
"
said
he
,
with
brotherly
tenderness
in
his
tone
.
<EOS>
"
If
my
mind
had
been
at
ease
<EOS>
I
could
ha
'
said
I
niver
were
happier
in
all
my
days
than
under
thy
roof
;
and
I
know
it
were
thy
doing
for
the
most
part
.
<EOS>
So
come
along
,
Hester
,
and
tell
me
if
there
's
aught
more
I
can
put
in
for
Sylvie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
might
not
have
been
a
very
appropriate
text
,
but
such
as
it
was
the
words
,
"
From
him
that
would
ask
of
thee
turn
not
thou
away
,
"
seemed
the
only
source
of
strength
that
could
have
enabled
her
to
go
patiently
through
the
next
half
-
hour
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
she
unselfishly
brought
all
her
mind
to
bear
upon
the
subject
;
admired
this
,
thought
and
decided
upon
that
,
<EOS>
as
one
by
one
Philip
showed
her
all
his
alterations
and
improvements
.
<EOS>
Never
was
such
a
quiet
little
bit
of
unconscious
and
unrecognized
heroism
.
<EOS>
She
really
ended
by
such
a
conquest
of
self
that
she
could
absolutely
sympathize
with
the
proud
expectant
lover
,
and
had
quenched
all
envy
of
the
beloved
,
in
sympathy
with
the
delight
she
imagined
Sylvia
must
experience
when
she
discovered
all
these
proofs
of
Philip
's
fond
consideration
and
care
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
a
great
strain
on
the
heart
,
that
source
of
life
;
and
when
Hester
returned
into
the
parlour
,
after
her
deliberate
survey
of
the
house
,
she
felt
as
weary
and
depressed
in
bodily
strength
as
if
she
had
gone
through
an
illness
of
many
days
.
<EOS>
She
sate
down
on
the
nearest
chair
,
and
felt
as
though
she
never
could
rise
again
.
<EOS>
Philip
,
joyous
and
content
,
stood
near
her
talking
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
,
Hester
,
"
said
he
,
"
Sylvie
has
given
me
a
message
for
thee
 
<EOS>
she
says
thou
must
be
<EOS>
her
bridesmaid
 
<EOS>
she
'll
have
none
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
,
"
said
Hester
,
with
sudden
sharpness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
but
yo
'
must
.
<EOS>
It
would
n't
be
like
my
wedding
if
thou
was
n't
there
:
why
I
've
looked
upon
thee
as
a
sister
iver
since
I
came
to
lodge
with
thy
mother
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hester
shook
her
head
.
<EOS>
Did
her
duty
require
her
not
to
turn
away
from
this
asking
,
too
?
<EOS>
Philip
saw
her
reluctance
,
and
,
by
intuition
rather
than
reason
,
he
knew
that
what
she
would
not
do
for
gaiety
or
pleasure
she
would
consent
to
,
if
by
so
doing
she
could
render
any
service
to
another
.
<EOS>
So
he
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
Besides
,
Sylvie
and
me
has
planned
to
go
for
our
wedding
jaunt
to
Robin
Hood
's
Bay
.
<EOS>
I
ha
'
been
to
engage
a
shandry
this
very
morn
,
before
t
'
shop
was
opened
;
and
there
's
no
one
to
leave
wi
'
my
aunt
.
<EOS>
Th
'
poor
old
body
is
sore
crushed
with
sorrow
;
and
is
,
as
one
may
say
,
childish
at
times
;
she
's
to
come
down
here
,
that
we
may
find
her
when
we
come
back
at
night
;
and
there
's
niver
a
one
she
'll
come
with
so
willing
and
so
happy
as
with
thee
,
Hester
.
<EOS>
Sylvie
and
me
has
both
said
so
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hester
looked
up
in
his
face
with
her
grave
honest
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
go
to
church
wi
'
thee
,
Philip
;
and
thou
must
not
ask
me
any
further
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
go
betimes
to
Haytersbank
Farm
,
and
I
'll
do
my
best
to
make
the
old
lady
happy
,
and
to
follow
out
thy
directions
in
bringing
her
here
before
nightfall
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
was
on
the
point
of
urging
her
afresh
to
go
with
them
to
church
;
but
something
in
her
eyes
brought
a
thought
across
his
mind
,
as
transitory
as
a
breath
passes
over
a
looking
-
glass
,
and
he
desisted
from
his
entreaty
,
and
put
away
his
thought
as
a
piece
of
vain
coxcombry
,
insulting
to
Hester
.
<EOS>
He
passed
rapidly
on
to
all
the
careful
directions
rendered
necessary
by
her
compliance
with
the
latter
part
of
his
request
,
coupling
Sylvia
's
name
with
his
perpetually
;
so
that
Hester
looked
upon
her
as
a
happy
girl
,
as
eager
in
planning
all
the
details
of
her
marriage
as
though
no
heavy
shameful
sorrow
had
passed
over
her
head
not
many
months
ago
.
  
<EOS>
Hester
did
not
see
Sylvia
's
white
,
dreamy
,
resolute
face
,
that
answered
the
solemn
questions
of
the
marriage
service
in
a
voice
that
did
not
seem
her
own
.
<EOS>
Hester
was
not
with
them
to
notice
the
heavy
abstraction
that
made
the
bride
as
if
unconscious
of
her
husband
's
loving
words
,
and
then
start
and
smile
,
and
reply
with
a
sad
gentleness
of
tone
.
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
Hester
's
duty
lay
in
conveying
the
poor
widow
and
mother
down
from
Haytersbank
to
the
new
home
in
Monkshaven
;
and
for
all
Hester
's
assistance
and
thoughtfulness
,
it
was
a
dreary
,
painful
piece
of
work
 
<EOS>
the
poor
old
woman
crying
like
a
child
,
with
bewilderment
at
the
confused
bustle
which
,
in
spite
of
all
Sylvia
's
careful
forethought
,
could
not
be
avoided
on
this
final
day
,
when
her
mother
had
to
be
carried
away
from
the
homestead
over
which
she
had
so
long
presided
.
<EOS>
But
all
this
was
as
nothing
to
the
distress
which
overwhelmed
poor
Bell
Robson
when
she
entered
Philip
's
house
;
the
parlour
 
<EOS>
the
whole
place
so
associated
with
the
keen
agony
she
had
undergone
there
,
that
the
stab
of
memory
penetrated
through
her
deadened
senses
,
and
brought
her
back
to
misery
.
<EOS>
In
vain
Hester
tried
to
console
her
by
telling
her
the
fact
of
Sylvia
's
marriage
with
Philip
in
every
form
of
words
that
occurred
to
her
.
<EOS>
Bell
only
remembered
her
husband
's
fate
,
which
filled
up
her
poor
wandering
mind
,
and
coloured
everything
;
insomuch
that
Sylvia
not
being
at
hand
to
reply
to
her
mother
's
cry
for
her
<EOS>
,
the
latter
imagined
that
her
child
,
as
well
as
her
husband
,
was
in
danger
of
trial
and
death
,
and
refused
to
be
comforted
by
any
endeavour
of
the
patient
sympathizing
Hester
.
<EOS>
In
a
pause
of
Mrs
Robson
's
sobs
,
Hester
heard
the
welcome
sound
of
the
wheels
of
the
returning
shandry
,
bearing
the
bride
and
bridegroom
home
.
<EOS>
It
stopped
at
the
door
 
<EOS>
an
instant
,
and
Sylvia
,
white
as
a
sheet
at
the
sound
of
her
mother
's
wailings
,
which
she
had
caught
while
yet
at
a
distance
,
with
the
quick
ears
of
love
,
came
running
in
;
her
mother
feebly
rose
and
tottered
towards
her
,
and
fell
into
her
arms
,
saying
,
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
Sylvie
,
Sylvie
,
take
me
home
,
and
away
from
this
cruel
place
!
"
  
<EOS>
Hester
could
not
but
be
touched
with
the
young
girl
's
manner
to
her
mother
 
as
tender
,
as
protecting
as
if
their
relation
to
each
other
had
been
reversed
,
and
she
was
lulling
and
tenderly
soothing
a
wayward
,
frightened
child
.
<EOS>
She
had
neither
eyes
nor
ears
for
any
one
till
her
mother
was
sitting
in
trembling
peace
,
holding
her
daughter
's
hand
tight
in
both
of
hers
,
as
if
afraid
of
losing
sight
of
her
:
then
Sylvia
turned
to
Hester
,
and
,
with
the
sweet
grace
which
is
a
natural
gift
to
some
happy
people
,
thanked
her
;
in
common
words
enough
she
thanked
her
,
but
in
that
nameless
manner
,
and
with
that
strange
,
rare
charm
which
made
Hester
feel
as
if
she
had
never
been
thanked
in
all
her
life
before
;
and
from
that
time
forth
she
understood
,
if
she
did
not
always
yield
to
,
the
unconscious
fascination
which
Sylvia
could
exercise
over
others
at
times
.
  
<EOS>
Did
it
enter
into
Philip
's
heart
to
perceive
that
he
had
wedded
his
long
-
sought
bride
in
mourning
raiment
,
and
that
the
first
sounds
which
greeted
them
as
they
approached
their
home
were
those
of
weeping
and
wailing
?
      
<EOS>
HAPPY
DAYS
  
<EOS>
And
now
Philip
seemed
as
prosperous
as
his
heart
could
desire
.
<EOS>
The
business
flourished
,
and
money
beyond
his
moderate
wants
came
in
.
<EOS>
As
for
himself
he
required
very
little
;
but
he
had
always
looked
forward
to
placing
his
idol
in
a
befitting
shrine
;
and
means
for
this
were
now
furnished
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
dress
,
the
comforts
,
the
position
he
had
desired
for
Sylvia
were
all
hers
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
need
to
do
a
stroke
of
household
work
if
she
preferred
to
"
sit
in
her
parlour
and
sew
up
a
seam
"
.
<EOS>
Indeed
Phoebe
resented
any
interference
in
the
domestic
labour
,
which
she
had
performed
so
long
,
that
she
looked
upon
the
kitchen
as
a
private
empire
of
her
own
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Hepburn
"
(
as
Sylvia
was
now
termed
)
had
a
good
dark
silk
gown
-
piece
in
her
drawers
,
as
well
as
the
poor
dove
-
coloured
,
against
the
day
when
she
chose
to
leave
off
mourning
;
and
stuff
for
either
gray
or
scarlet
cloaks
was
hers
at
her
bidding
.
  
<EOS>
What
she
cared
for
far
more
were
the
comforts
with
which
it
was
in
her
power
to
surround
her
mother
.
<EOS>
In
this
Philip
vied
with
her
;
for
besides
his
old
love
,
and
new
pity
for
his
aunt
Bell
,
he
never
forgot
how
she
had
welcomed
him
to
Haytersbank
,
and
favoured
his
love
to
Sylvia
,
in
the
yearning
days
when
he
little
hoped
he
should
ever
win
his
cousin
to
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
But
even
if
he
had
not
had
these
grateful
and
affectionate
feelings
towards
the
poor
woman
,
he
would
have
done
much
for
her
if
only
to
gain
the
sweet
,
rare
smiles
which
his
wife
never
bestowed
upon
him
so
freely
as
when
she
saw
him
attending
to
"
mother
,
"
for
so
both
of
them
now
called
Bell
.
<EOS>
For
her
creature
comforts
,
her
silk
gowns
,
and
her
humble
luxury
,
Sylvia
did
not
care
;
Philip
was
almost
annoyed
at
the
indifference
she
often
manifested
to
all
his
efforts
to
surround
her
with
such
things
.
<EOS>
It
was
even
a
hardship
to
her
to
leave
off
her
country
dress
,
her
uncovered
hair
,
her
linsey
petticoat
,
and
loose
bed
-
gown
,
and
to
don
a
stiff
and
stately
gown
for
her
morning
dress
.
<EOS>
Sitting
in
the
dark
parlour
at
the
back
of
the
shop
,
and
doing
"
white
work
,
"
was
much
more
wearying
to
her
than
running
out
into
the
fields
to
bring
up
the
cows
,
or
spinning
wool
,
or
making
up
butter
.
<EOS>
She
sometimes
thought
to
herself
that
it
was
a
strange
kind
of
life
where
there
were
no
out
-
door
animals
to
look
after
;
the
"
ox
and
the
ass
"
had
hitherto
come
into
all
her
ideas
of
humanity
;
and
her
care
and
gentleness
had
made
the
dumb
creatures
round
her
father
's
home
into
mute
friends
with
loving
eyes
,
looking
at
her
as
if
wistful
to
speak
in
words
the
grateful
regard
that
she
could
read
without
the
poor
expression
of
language
.
  
<EOS>
She
missed
the
free
open
air
,
the
great
dome
of
sky
above
the
fields
;
she
rebelled
against
the
necessity
of
"
dressing
"
(
as
she
called
it
)
to
go
out
,
although
she
acknowledged
that
it
was
a
necessity
where
the
first
step
beyond
the
threshold
must
be
into
a
populous
street
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
possible
that
Philip
was
right
at
one
time
when
he
had
thought
to
win
her
by
material
advantages
;
but
the
old
vanities
had
been
burnt
out
of
her
by
the
hot
iron
of
acute
suffering
.
<EOS>
A
great
deal
of
passionate
feeling
still
existed
,
concealed
and
latent
;
but
at
this
period
it
appeared
as
though
she
were
indifferent
to
most
things
,
and
had
lost
the
power
of
either
hoping
or
fearing
much
.
<EOS>
She
was
stunned
into
a
sort
of
temporary
numbness
on
most
points
;
those
on
which
she
was
sensitive
being
such
as
referred
to
the
injustice
and
oppression
of
her
father
's
death
,
or
anything
that
concerned
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
quiet
even
to
passiveness
in
all
her
dealings
with
Philip
;
he
would
have
given
not
a
little
for
some
of
the
old
bursts
of
impatience
,
the
old
pettishness
,
which
,
naughty
as
they
were
,
had
gone
to
form
his
idea
of
the
former
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
Once
or
twice
he
was
almost
vexed
with
her
for
her
docility
;
he
wanted
her
so
much
to
have
a
will
of
her
own
,
if
only
that
he
might
know
how
to
rouse
her
to
pleasure
by
gratifying
it
.
<EOS>
Indeed
he
seldom
fell
asleep
at
nights
without
his
last
thoughts
being
devoted
to
some
little
plan
for
the
morrow
,
that
he
fancied
she
would
like
;
and
when
he
wakened
in
the
early
dawn
he
looked
to
see
if
she
were
indeed
sleeping
by
his
side
,
or
whether
it
was
not
all
a
dream
that
he
called
Sylvia
"
wife
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
aware
that
her
affection
for
him
was
not
to
be
spoken
of
in
the
same
way
as
his
for
her
,
but
he
found
much
happiness
in
only
being
allowed
to
love
and
cherish
her
;
and
with
the
patient
perseverance
that
was
one
remarkable
feature
in
his
character
,
he
went
on
striving
to
deepen
and
increase
her
love
when
most
other
men
would
have
given
up
the
endeavour
,
made
themselves
content
with
half
a
heart
,
and
turned
to
some
other
object
of
attainment
.
<EOS>
All
this
time
Philip
was
troubled
by
a
dream
that
recurred
whenever
he
was
over
-
fatigued
,
or
otherwise
not
in
perfect
health
.
<EOS>
Over
and
over
again
in
this
first
year
of
married
life
he
dreamt
this
dream
;
perhaps
as
many
as
eight
or
nine
times
,
and
it
never
varied
.
<EOS>
It
was
always
of
Kinraid
's
return
;
Kinraid
was
full
of
life
in
Philip
's
dream
,
though
in
his
waking
hours
he
could
and
did
convince
himself
by
all
the
laws
of
probability
that
his
rival
was
dead
.
<EOS>
He
never
remembered
the
exact
sequence
of
events
in
that
terrible
dream
after
he
had
roused
himself
,
with
a
fight
and
a
struggle
,
from
his
feverish
slumbers
.
<EOS>
He
was
generally
sitting
up
in
bed
when
he
found
himself
conscious
,
his
heart
beating
wildly
,
with
a
conviction
of
Kinraid
's
living
presence
somewhere
near
him
in
the
darkness
.
<EOS>
Occasionally
Sylvia
was
disturbed
by
his
agitation
,
and
would
question
him
about
his
dreams
,
having
,
like
most
of
her
class
at
that
time
,
great
faith
in
their
prophetic
interpretation
;
but
Philip
never
gave
her
any
truth
in
his
reply
.
  
<EOS>
After
all
,
and
though
he
did
not
acknowledge
it
even
to
himself
,
the
long
-
desired
happiness
was
not
so
delicious
and
perfect
as
he
had
anticipated
.
<EOS>
Many
have
felt
the
same
in
their
first
year
of
married
life
;
but
the
faithful
,
patient
nature
that
still
works
on
,
striving
to
gain
love
,
and
capable
itself
of
steady
love
all
the
while
,
is
a
gift
not
given
to
all
.
  
<EOS>
For
many
weeks
after
their
wedding
,
Kester
never
came
near
them
:
a
chance
word
or
two
from
Sylvia
showed
Philip
that
she
had
noticed
this
and
regretted
it
;
and
,
accordingly
,
he
made
it
his
business
at
the
next
leisure
opportunity
to
go
to
Haytersbank
<EOS>
(
never
saying
a
word
to
his
wife
of
his
purpose
)
,
and
seek
out
Kester
.
  
<EOS>
All
the
whole
place
was
altered
!
<EOS>
It
was
new
white
-
washed
,
new
thatched
:
the
patches
of
colour
in
the
surrounding
ground
were
changed
with
altered
tillage
;
the
great
geraniums
were
gone
from
the
window
,
and
instead
,
was
a
smart
knitted
blind
.
<EOS>
Children
played
before
the
house
-
door
;
a
dog
lying
on
the
step
flew
at
Philip
;
all
was
so
strange
,
that
it
was
even
the
strangest
thing
of
all
for
Kester
to
appear
where
everything
else
was
so
altered
!
  
<EOS>
Philip
had
to
put
up
with
a
good
deal
of
crabbed
behaviour
on
the
part
of
the
latter
before
he
could
induce
Kester
to
promise
to
come
down
into
the
town
and
see
Sylvia
in
her
new
home
.
  
<EOS>
Somehow
,
the
visit
when
paid
was
but
a
failure
;
at
least
,
it
seemed
so
at
the
time
,
though
probably
it
broke
the
ice
of
restraint
which
was
forming
over
the
familiar
intercourse
between
Kester
and
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
The
old
servant
was
daunted
by
seeing
Sylvia
in
a
strange
place
,
and
stood
,
sleeking
his
hair
down
,
and
furtively
looking
about
him
,
instead
of
seating
himself
on
the
chair
<EOS>
Sylvia
had
so
eagerly
brought
forward
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
Then
his
sense
of
the
estrangement
caused
by
their
new
positions
infected
her
,
and
she
began
to
cry
pitifully
,
saying
,
    
"
Oh
,
Kester
!
<EOS>
Kester
!
<EOS>
tell
me
about
Haytersbank
!
<EOS>
Is
it
just
as
it
used
to
be
in
feyther
's
days
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
a
can
not
say
as
it
is
,
"
said
Kester
,
thankful
to
have
a
subject
started
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
They'n
pleughed
up
t
'
oud
pasture
-
field
,
and
are
settin
'
it
for
'
taters
.
<EOS>
They
're
not
for
much
cattle
,
is
n't
Higginses
.
<EOS>
They
'll
be
for
corn
in
t
'
next
year
,
a
reckon
,
and
they
'll
just
ha
'
their
pains
for
their
payment
.
<EOS>
But
they
're
allays
<EOS>
so
pig
-
headed
,
is
folk
fra
'
a
distance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
they
went
on
discoursing
on
Haytersbank
and
the
old
days
,
till
Bell
Robson
,
having
finished
her
afternoon
nap
,
came
slowly
down
-
stairs
to
join
them
;
and
after
that
the
conversation
became
so
broken
up
,
from
the
desire
of
the
other
two
to
attend
and
reply
as
best
they
could
to
her
fragmentary
and
disjointed
talk
,
that
Kester
took
his
leave
before
long
;
falling
,
as
he
did
so
,
into
the
formal
and
unnaturally
respectful
manner
which
he
had
adopted
on
first
coming
in
.
  
<EOS>
But
Sylvia
ran
after
him
,
and
brought
him
back
from
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
think
of
thy
going
away
,
Kester
,
without
either
bit
or
drink
;
nay
,
come
back
wi
'
thee
,
and
taste
wine
and
cake
.
"
  
<EOS>
Kester
stood
at
the
door
,
half
shy
,
half
pleased
,
while
Sylvia
,
in
all
the
glow
and
hurry
of
a
young
housekeeper
's
hospitality
,
sought
for
the
decanter
of
wine
,
and
a
wine
-
glass
in
the
corner
cupboard
,
and
hastily
cut
an
immense
wedge
of
cake
,
which
she
crammed
into
his
hand
in
spite
of
his
remonstrances
;
and
then
she
poured
him
out
an
overflowing
glass
of
wine
,
which
Kester
would
far
rather
have
gone
without
,
as
he
knew
manners
too
well
to
suppose
that
he
might
taste
it
without
having
gone
through
the
preliminary
ceremony
of
wishing
the
donor
health
and
happiness
.
<EOS>
He
stood
red
and
half
smiling
,
with
his
cake
in
one
hand
,
his
wine
in
the
other
,
and
then
began
,
      
"
Long
may
ye
live
,
  
<EOS>
Happy

ye

,
  
And

<EOS>
But
there

an

<EOS>
"
  
Having
ended
his
oration
,
much
to
his
own
satisfaction
,
Kester
tossed
off
his
glass
of
wine
,
smacked
his
lips
,
wiped
his
mouth
with
the
back
of
his
hand
,
pocketed
his
cake
,
and
made
off
.
  
<EOS>
That
night
Sylvia
spoke
of
his
visit
to
her
husband
.
<EOS>
Philip
never
said
how
he
himself
had
brought
it
to
pass
,
nor
did
he
name
the
fact
that
he
had
heard
the
old
man
come
in
just
as
he
himself
had
intended
going
into
the
parlour
for
tea
,
but
had
kept
away
,
as
he
thought
Sylvia
and
Kester
would
most
enjoy
their
interview
undisturbed
.
<EOS>
And
Sylvia
felt
as
if
her
husband
's
silence
was
unsympathizing
,
and
shut
up
the
feelings
that
were
just
beginning
to
expand
towards
him
.
<EOS>
She
sank
again
into
the
listless
state
of
indifference
from
which
nothing
but
some
reference
to
former
days
,
or
present
consideration
for
her
mother
,
could
rouse
her
.
  
<EOS>
Hester
was
almost
surprised
at
Sylvia
's
evident
liking
for
her
.
<EOS>
By
slow
degrees
Hester
was
learning
to
love
the
woman
,
whose
position
as
Philip
's
wife
she
would
have
envied
<EOS>
so
keenly
had
she
not
been
so
truly
good
and
pious
.
<EOS>
But
Sylvia
seemed
as
though
she
had
given
Hester
her
whole
affection
all
at
once
.
<EOS>
Hester
could
not
understand
this
,
while
she
was
touched
and
melted
by
the
trust
it
implied
.
<EOS>
For
one
thing
Sylvia
remembered
and
regretted
 
her
harsh
treatment
of
Hester
the
rainy
,
stormy
night
on
which
the
latter
had
come
to
Haytersbank
to
seek
her
and
her
mother
,
and
bring
them
into
Monkshaven
to
see
the
imprisoned
father
and
husband
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
had
been
struck
with
Hester
's
patient
endurance
of
her
rudeness
,
a
rudeness
which
she
was
conscious
that
she
herself
should
have
immediately
and
vehemently
resented
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
did
not
understand
how
a
totally
different
character
from
hers
might
immediately
forgive
the
anger
she
could
not
forget
;
and
because
Hester
had
been
so
meek
at
the
time
,
Sylvia
,
who
knew
how
passing
and
transitory
was
her
own
anger
,
thought
that
all
was
forgotten
;
while
Hester
believed
that
the
words
,
which
she
herself
could
not
have
uttered
except
under
deep
provocation
,
meant
much
more
than
they
did
,
and
admired
and
wondered
at
Sylvia
for
having
so
entirely
conquered
her
anger
against
her
.
  
<EOS>
Again
,
the
two
different
women
were
divergently
affected
by
the
extreme
fondness
which
Bell
had
shown
towards
Hester
ever
since
Sylvia
's
wedding
-
day
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
,
who
had
always
received
more
love
from
others
than
she
knew
what
to
do
with
,
had
the
most
entire
faith
in
her
own
supremacy
in
her
mother
's
heart
,
though
at
times
Hester
would
do
certain
things
more
to
the
poor
old
woman
's
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
Hester
,
who
had
craved
for
the
affection
which
had
been
withheld
from
her
,
and
had
from
that
one
circumstance
become
distrustful
of
her
own
power
of
inspiring
regard
,
while
she
exaggerated
the
delight
of
being
beloved
,
feared
lest
Sylvia
should
become
jealous
of
her
mother
's
open
display
of
great
attachment
and
occasional
preference
for
Hester
.
<EOS>
But
such
a
thought
never
entered
Sylvia
's
mind
.
<EOS>
She
was
more
thankful
than
she
knew
how
to
express
towards
any
one
who
made
her
mother
happy
;
as
has
been
already
said
,
the
contributing
to
Bell
Robson
's
pleasures
earned
Philip
more
of
his
wife
's
smiles
than
anything
else
.
<EOS>
And
Sylvia
threw
her
whole
heart
into
the
words
and
caresses
she
lavished
on
Hester
whenever
poor
Mrs.
Robson
spoke
of
the
goodness
and
kindness
of
the
latter
.
<EOS>
Hester
attributed
more
virtue
to
these
sweet
words
and
deeds
of
gratitude
than
they
deserved
;
they
did
not
imply
in
Sylvia
any
victory
over
evil
temptation
,
as
they
would
have
done
in
Hester
.
  
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
be
Sylvia
's
fate
to
captivate
more
people
than
she
cared
to
like
back
again
.
<EOS>
She
turned
the
heads
of
John
and
Jeremiah
Foster
,
who
could
hardly
congratulate
Philip
enough
on
his
choice
of
a
wife
.
  
<EOS>
They
had
been
prepared
to
be
critical
on
one
who
had
interfered
with
their
favourite
project
of
a
marriage
between
Philip
and
Hester
;
and
,
though
full
of
compassion
for
the
cruelty
of
Daniel
Robson
's
fate
,
they
were
too
completely
men
of
business
not
to
have
some
apprehension
that
the
connection
of
Philip
Hepburn
with
the
daughter
of
a
man
who
was
hanged
,
might
injure
the
shop
over
which
both
his
and
their
name
appeared
.
<EOS>
But
all
the
possible
proprieties
demanded
that
they
should
pay
attention
to
the
bride
of
their
former
shopman
and
present
successor
;
and
the
very
first
visitors
whom
Sylvia
had
received
after
her
marriage
had
been
John
and
Jeremiah
Foster
,
in
their
sabbath
-
day
clothes
.
<EOS>
They
found
her
in
the
parlour
(
so
familiar
to
both
of
them
!
)
<EOS>
clear
-
starching
her
mother
's
caps
,
which
had
to
be
got
up
in
some
particular
fashion
that
Sylvia
was
afraid
of
dictating
to
Phoebe
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
a
little
disturbed
at
her
visitors
discovering
her
at
this
employment
;
but
she
was
on
her
own
ground
,
and
that
gave
her
self
-
possession
;
and
she
welcomed
the
two
old
men
so
sweetly
and
modestly
,
and
looked
so
pretty
and
feminine
,
and
,
besides
,
so
notable
in
her
handiwork
,
that
she
conquered
all
their
prejudices
at
one
blow
;
and
their
first
thought
on
leaving
the
shop
was
how
to
do
her
honour
,
by
inviting
her
to
a
supper
party
at
Jeremiah
Foster
's
house
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
was
dismayed
when
she
was
bidden
to
this
wedding
feast
,
and
Philip
had
to
use
all
his
authority
,
though
tenderly
,
to
make
her
consent
to
go
at
all
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
to
merry
country
parties
like
the
Corneys
'
,
and
to
bright
haymaking
romps
in
the
open
air
;
but
never
to
a
set
stately
party
at
a
friend
's
house
.
  
<EOS>
She
would
fain
have
made
attendance
on
her
mother
an
excuse
;
but
Philip
knew
he
must
not
listen
to
any
such
plea
,
and
applied
to
Hester
in
the
dilemma
,
asking
her
to
remain
with
Mrs.
Robson
while
he
and
Sylvia
went
out
visiting
;
and
Hester
had
willingly
,
nay
,
eagerly
consented
 
<EOS>
it
was
much
more
to
her
taste
than
going
out
.
  
<EOS>
So
Philip
and
Sylvia
set
out
,
arm
-
in
-
arm
,
down
Bridge
Street
,
across
the
bridge
,
and
then
clambered
up
the
hill
.
<EOS>
On
the
way
he
gave
her
the
directions
she
asked
for
about
her
behaviour
as
bride
and
most
honoured
guest
;
and
altogether
succeeded
,
against
his
intention
and
will
,
in
frightening
her
so
completely
as
to
the
grandeur
and
importance
of
the
occasion
,
and
the
necessity
of
remembering
certain
set
rules
,
and
making
certain
set
speeches
and
attending
to
them
when
the
right
time
came
,
that
,
if
any
one
so
naturally
graceful
could
have
been
awkward
,
Sylvia
would
have
been
so
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
she
sate
,
pale
and
weary
-
looking
,
on
the
very
edge
of
her
chair
;
she
uttered
the
formal
words
which
Philip
had
told
her
were
appropriate
to
the
occasion
,
and
she
heartily
wished
herself
safe
at
home
and
in
bed
.
<EOS>
Yet
she
left
but
<EOS>
one
unanimous
impression
on
the
company
when
she
went
away
,
namely
,
that
she
was
the
prettiest
and
best
-
behaved
woman
they
had
ever
seen
,
and
that
Philip
Hepburn
had
done
well
in
choosing
her
,
felon
's
daughter
though
she
might
be
.
  
<EOS>
Both
the
hosts
had
followed
her
into
the
lobby
to
help
Philip
in
cloaking
her
,
and
putting
on
her
pattens
.
<EOS>
They
were
full
of
old
-
fashioned
compliments
and
good
wishes
;
one
speech
of
theirs
came
up
to
her
memory
in
future
years
:
    
"
Now
,
Sylvia
Hepburn
,
"
said
Jeremiah
,
"
I
've
known
thy
husband
long
,
and
<EOS>
I
do
n't
say
but
<EOS>
what
thou
hast
done
well
in
choosing
him
;
but
if
he
ever
neglects
or
ill
-
uses
thee
,
come
to
me
,
and
I
'll
give
him
a
sound
lecture
on
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
Mind
,
I
'm
thy
friend
from
this
day
forrards
,
and
ready
to
take
thy
part
against
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
smiled
as
if
the
day
would
never
come
when
he
should
neglect
or
ill
-
use
his
darling
;
Sylvia
smiled
a
little
,
without
much
attending
to
,
or
caring
for
,
the
words
that
were
detaining
her
,
tired
as
she
was
;
John
and
Jeremiah
chuckled
over
the
joke
;
but
the
words
came
up
again
in
after
days
,
as
words
idly
spoken
sometimes
do
.
  
<EOS>
Before
the
end
of
that
first
year
,
Philip
had
learnt
to
be
jealous
of
his
wife
's
new
love
for
Hester
.
<EOS>
To
the
latter
,
Sylvia
gave
the
free
confidence
on
many
things
which
Philip
fancied
she
withheld
from
him
.
<EOS>
A
suspicion
crossed
his
mind
,
from
time
to
time
,
that
Sylvia
might
speak
of
her
former
lover
to
Hester
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
not
unnatural
,
he
thought
,
if
she
did
so
,
believing
him
to
be
dead
;
but
the
idea
irritated
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
entirely
mistaken
,
however
;
Sylvia
,
with
all
her
apparent
frankness
,
kept
her
deep
sorrows
to
herself
.
<EOS>
She
never
mentioned
her
father
's
name
,
though
he
was
continually
present
to
her
mind
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
she
speak
of
Kinraid
to
human
being
,
though
,
for
his
sake
,
her
voice
softened
when
,
by
chance
,
she
spoke
to
a
passing
sailor
;
and
for
his
sake
her
eyes
lingered
on
such
men
longer
than
on
others
,
trying
to
discover
in
them
something
of
the
old
familiar
gait
;
and
partly
for
his
dead
sake
,
and
partly
because
of
the
freedom
of
the
outlook
and
the
freshness
of
the
air
,
she
was
glad
occasionally
to
escape
from
the
comfortable
imprisonment
of
her
"
parlour
"
,
and
the
close
streets
around
the
market
-
place
,
and
to
mount
the
cliffs
and
sit
on
the
turf
,
gazing
abroad
over
the
wide
still
expanse
of
the
open
sea
;
for
,
at
that
height
,
even
breaking
waves
only
looked
like
broken
lines
of
white
foam
on
the
blue
watery
plain
.
  
<EOS>
She
did
not
want
any
companion
on
these
rambles
,
which
had
somewhat
of
the
delight
of
stolen
pleasures
;
for
all
the
other
respectable
matrons
and
town
-
dwellers
whom
she
knew
were
content
to
have
always
a
business
object
for
their
walk
,
or
else
to
stop
at
home
in
their
own
households
;
and
Sylvia
was
rather
ashamed
of
her
own
yearnings
for
solitude
and
open
air
,
and
the
sight
and
sound
of
the
mother
-
like
sea
.
<EOS>
She
used
to
take
off
her
hat
,
and
sit
there
,
her
hands
clasping
her
knees
,
the
salt
air
lifting
her
bright
curls
,
gazing
at
the
distant
horizon
over
the
sea
,
in
a
sad
dreaminess
of
thought
;
if
she
had
been
asked
on
what
she
meditated
,
she
could
not
have
told
you
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
by
-
and
-
by
,
the
time
came
when
she
was
a
prisoner
in
the
house
;
a
prisoner
in
her
room
,
lying
in
bed
with
a
little
baby
by
her
side
 
her
child
,
Philip
's
child
.
<EOS>
His
pride
,
his
delight
knew
no
bounds
;
this
was
a
new
fast
tie
between
them
;
this
would
reconcile
her
to
the
kind
of
life
that
,
with
all
its
respectability
and
comfort
,
was
so
different
from
what
she
had
lived
before
,
and
which
Philip
had
often
perceived
that
she
felt
to
be
dull
and
restraining
.
<EOS>
He
already
began
to
trace
in
the
little
girl
,
only
a
few
days
old
,
the
lovely
curves
that
he
knew
so
well
by
heart
in
the
mother
's
face
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
,
too
,
pale
,
still
,
and
weak
,
was
very
happy
;
yes
,
really
happy
for
the
first
time
since
her
irrevocable
marriage
.
<EOS>
For
its
irrevocableness
had
weighed
much
upon
her
with
a
sense
of
dull
hopelessness
;
she
felt
all
Philip
's
kindness
,
she
was
grateful
to
him
for
his
tender
regard
towards
her
mother
,
she
was
learning
to
love
him
as
well
as
to
like
and
respect
him
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
know
what
else
she
could
have
done
but
marry
so
true
a
friend
,
and
she
and
her
mother
so
friendless
;
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
it
was
like
lead
on
her
morning
spirits
when
she
awoke
and
remembered
that
the
decision
was
made
,
the
dead
was
done
,
<EOS>
the
choice
taken
which
comes
to
most
people
but
once
in
their
lives
.
<EOS>
Now
the
little
baby
came
in
upon
this
state
of
mind
like
a
ray
of
sunlight
into
a
gloomy
room
.
  
<EOS>
Even
her
mother
was
rejoiced
and
proud
;
even
with
her
crazed
brain
and
broken
heart
,
the
sight
of
sweet
,
peaceful
infancy
brought
light
to
her
.
<EOS>
All
the
old
ways
of
holding
a
baby
,
of
hushing
it
to
sleep
,
of
tenderly
guarding
its
little
limbs
from
injury
,
came
back
,
like
the
habits
of
her
youth
,
to
Bell
;
and
she
was
never
so
happy
or
so
easy
in
her
mind
,
or
so
sensible
and
connected
in
her
ideas
,
as
when
she
had
Sylvia
's
baby
in
her
arms
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
pretty
sight
to
see
,
however
familiar
to
all
of
us
<EOS>
such
things
may
be
 
the
pale
,
worn
old
woman
,
in
her
quaint
,
old
-
fashioned
country
dress
,
holding
the
little
infant
on
her
knees
,
looking
at
its
open
,
unspeculative
eyes
,
and
talking
the
little
language
to
it
as
though
it
could
understand
;
the
father
on
his
knees
,
kept
prisoner
by
a
small
,
small
finger
curled
round
his
strong
and
sinewy
one
,
and
gazing
at
the
tiny
creature
with
wondering
idolatry
;
the
young
mother
,
fair
,
pale
,
and
smiling
,
propped
up
on
pillows
in
order
that
she
,
too
,
might
see
the
wonderful
babe
;
it
was
astonishing
how
the
doctor
could
come
and
go
without
being
drawn
into
the
admiring
vortex
,
and
look
at
this
baby
just
as
if
babies
came
into
the
world
every
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
Philip
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
one
night
,
as
he
sate
as
still
as
a
mouse
in
her
room
,
imagining
her
to
be
asleep
.
<EOS>
He
was
by
her
bed
-
side
in
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
been
thinking
what
she
's
to
be
called
.
<EOS>
Isabella
,
after
mother
;
and
what
were
yo'r
mother
's
name
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Margaret
,
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
Margaret
Isabella
;
Isabella
Margaret
.
<EOS>
Mother
's
called
Bell
.
<EOS>
She
might
be
called
Bella

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
ha
'
wished
her
to
be
called
after
thee
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
made
a
little
impatient
movement
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
;
Sylvia
's
not
a
lucky
name
.
<EOS>
Best
be
called
after
thy
mother
and
mine
.
<EOS>
And
I
want
for
to
ask
Hester
to
be
godmother
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Anything
thou
likes
,
sweetheart
.
<EOS>
Shall
we
call
her
Rose
,
after
Hester
Rose
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
!
"
said
Sylvia
;
"
she
mun
be
called
after
my
mother
,
or
thine
,
or
both
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
her
to
be
called
Bella
,
after
mother
,
because
she
's
so
fond
of
baby
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Anything
to
please
thee
,
darling
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
say
that
as
if
it
did
n't
signify
;
there
's
a
deal
in
having
a
pretty
name
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
a
little
annoyed
.
<EOS>
"
I
ha
'
allays
hated
being
called
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
It
were
after
father
's
mother
,
Sylvia
Steele
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
niver
thought
any
name
in
a
'
the
world
so
sweet
and
pretty
as
Sylvia
,
"
said
Philip
,
fondly
;
but
she
was
too
much
absorbed
in
her
own
thoughts
to
notice
either
his
manner
or
his
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
yo'll
not
mind
if
it
is
Bella
,
because
yo
'
see
my
mother
is
alive
to
be
pleased
by
its
being
named
after
her
,
and
Hester
may
be
godmother
,
and
I
'll
ha
<EOS>
'
t
'
dove
-
coloured
silk
as
yo
'
gave
me
afore
<EOS>
we
were
married
made
up
into
a
cloak
for
it
to
go
to
church
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
got
it
for
thee
,
"
said
Philip
,
a
little
disappointed
.
<EOS>
"
It
'll
be
too
good
for
the
baby
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Eh
!
<EOS>
but
I
'm
so
careless
,
I
should
be
spilling
something
on
it
?
<EOS>
But
if
thou
got
it
for
me
I
can
not
find
i
'
<EOS>
my
heart
for
t
'
wear
it
on
baby
,
and
I
'll
have
it
made
into
a
christening
gown
for
mysel
'
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
niver
feel
at
my
ease
in
it
,
for
fear
of
spoiling
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Well
!
<EOS>
an
'
if
thou
does
spoil
it
,
love
,
I
'll
get
thee
another
.
<EOS>
I
make
account
of
riches
only
for
thee
;
that
I
may
be
able
to
get
thee
whativer
<EOS>
thou
's
a
fancy
for
,
for
either
thysel
'
,
or
thy
mother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
lifted
her
pale
face
from
her
pillow
,
and
put
up
her
lips
to
kiss
him
for
these
words
.
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
on
that
day
Philip
reached
the
zenith
of
his
life
's
happiness
.
    
<EOS>
EVIL
OMENS
  
<EOS>
The
first
step
in
Philip
's
declension
happened
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
had
made
rapid
progress
in
her
recovery
;
but
now
she
seemed
at
a
stationary
point
of
weakness
;
wakeful
nights
succeeding
to
languid
days
.
<EOS>
Occasionally
she
caught
a
little
sleep
in
the
afternoons
,
but
she
usually
awoke
startled
and
feverish
.
  
<EOS>
One
afternoon
Philip
had
stolen
upstairs
to
look
at
her
and
his
child
;
but
the
efforts
he
made
at
careful
noiselessness
made
the
door
creak
on
its
hinges
as
he
opened
it
.
<EOS>
The
woman
employed
to
nurse
her
had
taken
the
baby
into
another
room
that
no
sound
might
rouse
her
from
her
slumber
;
and
Philip
would
probably
have
been
warned
against
entering
the
chamber
where
his
wife
lay
sleeping
had
he
been
perceived
by
the
nurse
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
he
opened
the
door
,
made
a
noise
,
and
Sylvia
started
up
,
her
face
all
one
flush
,
her
eyes
wild
and
uncertain
;
she
looked
about
her
as
if
she
did
not
know
where
she
was
;
pushed
the
hair
off
her
hot
forehead
;
all
which
actions
Philip
saw
,
dismayed
and
regretful
.
<EOS>
But
he
kept
still
,
hoping
that
she
would
lie
down
and
compose
herself
.
<EOS>
Instead
she
stretched
out
her
arms
imploringly
,
and
said
,
in
a
voice
full
of
yearning
and
tears
,
    
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
Charley
!
<EOS>
come
to
me
 
come
to
me
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
as
she
more
fully
became
aware
of
the
place
where
she
was
,
her
actual
situation
<EOS>
,
she
sank
back
and
feebly
began
to
cry
.
<EOS>
Philip
's
heart
boiled
within
him
;
any
man
's
would
under
the
circumstances
,
but
he
had
the
sense
of
guilty
concealment
to
aggravate
the
intensity
of
his
feelings
.
<EOS>
Her
weak
cry
after
another
man
,
too
,
irritated
him
,
partly
through
his
anxious
love
,
which
made
him
wise
to
know
how
much
physical
harm
she
was
doing
herself
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
he
stirred
,
or
unintentionally
made
some
sound
:
she
started
up
afresh
,
and
called
out
,
    
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
who
's
theere
?
<EOS>
Do
,
for
God
's
sake
,
tell
me
who
yo
'
are
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
me
,
"
said
Philip
,
coming
forwards
,
striving
to
keep
down
the
miserable
complication
of
love
and
jealousy
,
and
remorse
and
anger
,
that
made
his
heart
beat
so
wildly
,
and
almost
took
him
out
of
himself
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
must
have
been
quite
beside
himself
for
the
time
,
or
he
could
never
have
gone
on
to
utter
the
unwise
,
cruel
words
he
did
.
<EOS>
But
she
spoke
first
,
in
a
distressed
and
plaintive
tone
of
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Philip
,
I
've
been
asleep
,
and
yet
I
think
I
was
awake
!
<EOS>
And
I
saw
Charley
Kinraid
as
plain
as
iver
I
see
thee
now
,
and
he
was
n't
drowned
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
he
's
alive
somewheere
;
he
were
so
clear
and
life
-
like
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
what
shall
I
do
?
<EOS>
what
shall
I
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
wrung
her
hands
in
feverish
distress
.
<EOS>
Urged
by
passionate
feelings
of
various
kinds
,
and
also
by
his
desire
to
quench
the
agitation
which
was
doing
her
harm
,
Philip
spoke
,
hardly
knowing
what
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Kinraid
's
dead
,
I
tell
yo
'
,
Sylvie
!
<EOS>
And
what
kind
of
a
woman
are
yo
'
to
go
dreaming
of
another
man
<EOS>
i
'
this
way
,
and
taking
on
so
about
him
,
when
yo're
a
wedded
wife
,
with
a
child
as
yo've
borne
to
another
man
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
In
a
moment
he
could
have
bitten
out
his
tongue
.
<EOS>
She
looked
at
him
with
the
mute
reproach
which
some
of
us
see
(
God
help
us
!
)
<EOS>
in
the
eyes
of
the
dead
,
as
they
come
before
our
sad
memories
in
the
night
-
season
;
looked
at
him
with
such
a
solemn
,
searching
look
,
never
saying
a
word
of
reply
or
defence
.
<EOS>
Then
she
lay
down
,
motionless
and
silent
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
instantly
stung
with
remorse
for
his
speech
;
the
words
were
not
beyond
his
lips
when
an
agony
had
entered
his
heart
;
but
her
steady
,
dilated
eyes
had
kept
him
dumb
and
motionless
as
if
by
a
spell
.
  
<EOS>
Now
he
rushed
to
the
bed
on
which
she
lay
,
and
half
knelt
,
half
threw
himself
upon
it
,
imploring
her
to
forgive
him
;
regardless
for
the
time
of
any
evil
consequences
to
her
,
it
seemed
as
if
he
must
have
her
pardon
 
<EOS>
her
relenting
 
at
any
price
,
even
if
they
both
died
in
the
act
of
reconciliation
.
<EOS>
But
she
lay
speechless
,
and
,
as
far
as
she
could
be
,
motionless
,
the
bed
trembling
under
her
with
the
quivering
she
could
not
still
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
's
wild
tones
caught
the
nurse
's
ears
,
and
she
entered
full
of
the
dignified
indignation
of
wisdom
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
yo
'
for
killing
yo'r
wife
,
measter
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
.
<EOS>
"
She
's
noane
so
strong
as
she
can
bear
flytin
'
and
scoldin
'
,
nor
will
she
be
for
many
a
week
to
come
.
<EOS>
Go
down
wi
'
ye
,
and
leave
her
i
'
peace
if
yo're
a
man
as
can
be
called
a
man
!
"
  
<EOS>
Her
anger
was
rising
as
she
caught
sight
of
Sylvia
's
averted
face
.
<EOS>
It
was
flushed
crimson
,
her
eyes
full
of
intense
emotion
of
some
kind
,
her
lips
compressed
;
but
an
involuntary
twitching
overmastering
her
resolute
stillness
from
time
to
time
.
<EOS>
Philip
,
who
did
not
see
the
averted
face
,
nor
understand
the
real
danger
in
which
he
was
placing
his
wife
,
felt
as
though
he
must
have
one
word
,
one
responsive
touch
of
the
hand
which
lay
passive
in
his
,
which
was
not
even
drawn
away
from
the
kisses
with
which
he
covered
it
,
any
more
than
if
it
had
been
an
impassive
stone
.
<EOS>
The
nurse
had
fairly
to
take
him
by
the
shoulders
,
and
turn
him
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
In
half
an
hour
the
doctor
had
to
be
summoned
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
the
nurse
gave
him
her
version
of
the
events
of
the
afternoon
,
with
much
_
animus
_
against
Philip
;
and
the
doctor
thought
it
his
duty
to
have
some
very
serious
conversation
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
assure
you
,
Mr.
Hepburn
,
that
,
in
the
state
your
wife
has
been
in
for
some
days
,
it
was
little
less
than
madness
on
your
part
to
speak
to
her
about
anything
that
could
give
rise
to
strong
emotion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
madness
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Philip
,
in
a
low
,
miserable
tone
of
voice
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
's
heart
was
touched
,
in
spite
of
the
nurse
's
accusations
against
the
scolding
husband
.
<EOS>
Yet
the
danger
was
now
too
serious
for
him
to
mince
matters
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
tell
you
that
I
can
not
answer
for
her
life
,
unless
the
greatest
precautions
are
taken
on
your
part
,
and
unless
the
measures
I
shall
use
have
the
effect
I
wish
for
in
the
next
twenty
-
four
hours
.
<EOS>
She
is
on
the
verge
of
a
brain
fever
.
<EOS>
Any
allusion
to
the
subject
which
has
been
the
final
cause
of
the
state
in
which
she
now
is
must
be
most
cautiously
avoided
,
even
to
a
chance
word
which
may
bring
it
to
her
memory
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
so
on
;
<EOS>
but
Philip
seemed
to
hear
only
this
:
then
he
might
not
express
contrition
,
or
sue
for
pardon
,
he
must
go
on
unforgiven
through
all
this
stress
of
anxiety
;
and
even
if
she
recovered
the
doctor
warned
him
of
the
undesirableness
of
recurring
to
what
had
passed
!
  
<EOS>
Heavy
miserable
times
of
endurance
and
waiting
have
to
be
passed
through
by
all
during
the
course
of
their
lives
;
and
Philip
had
had
his
share
of
such
seasons
,
when
the
heart
,
and
the
will
,
and
the
speech
,
and
the
limbs
,
must
be
bound
down
with
strong
resolution
to
patience
.
  
<EOS>
For
many
days
,
nay
,
for
weeks
,
he
was
forbidden
to
see
Sylvia
,
as
the
very
sound
of
his
footstep
brought
on
a
recurrence
of
the
fever
and
convulsive
movement
.
<EOS>
Yet
she
seemed
,
from
questions
she
feebly
asked
the
nurse
,
to
have
forgotten
all
that
had
happened
on
the
day
of
her
attack
from
the
time
when
she
dropped
off
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
But
how
much
she
remembered
of
after
occurrences
no
one
could
ascertain
.
<EOS>
She
was
quiet
enough
when
,
at
length
,
Philip
was
allowed
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
half
jealous
of
his
child
,
when
he
watched
how
she
could
smile
at
it
,
while
she
never
changed
a
muscle
of
her
face
at
all
he
could
do
or
say
.
  
<EOS>
And
of
a
piece
with
this
extreme
quietude
and
reserve
was
her
behaviour
to
him
when
at
length
she
had
fully
recovered
,
and
was
able
to
go
about
the
house
again
.
<EOS>
Philip
thought
many
a
time
of
the
words
she
had
used
long
before
 
before
their
marriage
.
<EOS>
Ominous
words
they
were
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
in
me
to
forgive
;
I
sometimes
think
it
's
not
in
me
to
forget
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
was
tender
even
to
humility
in
his
conduct
towards
her
.
<EOS>
But
nothing
stirred
her
from
her
fortress
of
reserve
.
<EOS>
And
he
knew
she
was
so
different
;
he
knew
how
loving
,
nay
,
passionate
,
was
her
nature
 
<EOS>
vehement
,
demonstrative
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
how
could
he
stir
her
once
more
into
expression
,
even
if
the
first
show
or
speech
she
made
was
of
anger
?
<EOS>
Then
he
tried
being
angry
with
her
himself
;
he
was
sometimes
unjust
to
her
consciously
and
of
a
purpose
,
in
order
to
provoke
her
into
defending
herself
,
and
appealing
against
his
unkindness
.
<EOS>
He
only
seemed
to
drive
her
love
away
still
more
.
  
<EOS>
If
any
one
had
known
all
that
was
passing
in
that
household
,
while
yet
the
story
of
it
was
not
ended
,
nor
,
indeed
,
come
to
its
crisis
,
their
hearts
would
have
been
sorry
for
the
man
who
lingered
long
at
the
door
of
the
room
in
which
his
wife
sate
cooing
and
talking
to
her
baby
,
and
sometimes
laughing
back
to
it
,
or
who
was
soothing
the
querulousness
of
failing
age
with
every
possible
patience
of
love
;
sorry
for
the
poor
listener
who
was
hungering
for
the
profusion
of
tenderness
thus
scattered
on
the
senseless
air
,
yet
only
by
stealth
caught
the
echoes
of
what
ought
to
have
been
his
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
so
difficult
to
complain
,
too
;
impossible
,
in
fact
.
<EOS>
Everything
that
a
wife
could
do
from
duty
she
did
;
but
the
love
seemed
to
have
fled
,
and
,
in
such
cases
,
no
reproaches
or
complaints
can
avail
to
bring
it
back
.
<EOS>
So
reason
outsiders
,
and
are
convinced
of
the
result
before
the
experiment
is
made
.
<EOS>
But
Philip
could
not
reason
,
or
could
not
yield
to
reason
;
and
so
he
complained
and
reproached
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
much
answer
him
;
but
he
thought
that
her
eyes
expressed
the
old
words
,
    
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
in
me
to
forgive
;
I
sometimes
think
it
's
not
in
me
to
forget
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
However
,
it
is
an
old
story
,
an
ascertained
fact
,
that
,
even
in
the
most
tender
and
stable
masculine
natures
,
at
the
supremest
season
of
their
lives
,
there
is
room
for
other
thoughts
and
passions
than
such
as
are
connected
with
love
.
<EOS>
Even
with
the
most
domestic
and
affectionate
men
,
their
emotions
seem
to
be
kept
in
a
cell
distinct
and
away
from
their
actual
lives
.
<EOS>
Philip
had
other
thoughts
and
other
occupations
than
those
connected
with
his
wife
during
all
this
time
.
  
<EOS>
An
uncle
of
his
mother
's
,
a
Cumberland
"
statesman
"
,
of
whose
existence
he
was
barely
conscious
,
died
about
this
time
,
leaving
to
his
unknown
great
-
nephew
four
or
five
hundred
pounds
,
which
put
him
at
once
in
a
different
position
with
regard
to
his
business
.
<EOS>
Henceforward
his
ambition
was
roused
,
 
such
humble
ambition
as
befitted
a
shop
-
keeper
in
a
country
town
sixty
or
seventy
years
ago
.
<EOS>
To
be
respected
by
the
men
around
him
had
always
been
an
object
with
him
,
and
was
,
perhaps
,
becoming
more
so
than
ever
now
,
as
a
sort
of
refuge
from
his
deep
,
sorrowful
mortification
in
other
directions
.
<EOS>
He
was
greatly
pleased
at
being
made
a
sidesman
;
and
,
in
preparation
for
the
further
honour
of
being
churchwarden
,
he
went
regularly
twice
a
day
to
church
on
Sundays
.
<EOS>
There
was
enough
religious
feeling
in
him
to
make
him
disguise
the
worldly
reason
for
such
conduct
from
himself
.
<EOS>
He
believed
that
he
went
because
he
thought
it
right
to
attend
public
worship
in
the
parish
church
whenever
it
was
offered
up
;
but
it
may
be
questioned
of
him
,
as
of
many
others
,
how
far
he
would
have
been
as
regular
in
attendance
in
a
place
where
he
was
not
known
.
<EOS>
With
this
,
however
,
we
have
nothing
to
do
.
<EOS>
The
fact
was
that
he
went
regularly
to
church
,
and
he
wished
his
wife
to
accompany
him
to
the
pew
,
newly
painted
,
with
his
name
on
the
door
,
where
he
sate
in
full
sight
of
the
clergyman
and
congregation
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
had
never
been
in
the
habit
of
such
regular
church
-
going
,
and
she
felt
it
as
a
hardship
,
and
slipped
out
of
the
duty
as
often
as
ever
she
could
.
<EOS>
In
her
unmarried
days
,
she
and
her
parents
had
gone
annually
to
the
mother
-
church
of
the
parish
in
which
Haytersbank
was
situated
:
on
the
Monday
succeeding
the
Sunday
next
after
the
Romish
Saint
's
Day
,
to
whom
the
church
was
dedicated
,
there
was
a
great
feast
or
wake
held
;
and
,
on
the
Sunday
,
all
the
parishioners
came
to
church
from
far
and
near
.
<EOS>
Frequently
,
too
,
in
the
course
of
the
year
,
Sylvia
would
accompany
one
or
other
of
her
parents
to
Scarby
Moorside
afternoon
service
,
 
when
the
hay
was
got
in
,
and
the
corn
not
ready
for
cutting
,
or
the
cows
were
dry
and
there
was
no
afternoon
milking
.
<EOS>
Many
clergymen
were
languid
in
those
days
,
and
did
not
too
curiously
inquire
into
the
reasons
which
gave
them
such
small
congregations
in
country
parishes
.
  
<EOS>
Now
she
was
married
,
this
weekly
church
-
going
which
Philip
seemed
to
expect
from
her
,
became
a
tie
and
a
small
hardship
,
which
connected
itself
with
her
life
of
respectability
and
prosperity
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
crust
of
bread
and
liberty
'
was
much
more
accordant
to
Sylvia
's
nature
than
plenty
of
creature
comforts
and
many
restraints
.
<EOS>
Another
wish
of
Philip
's
,
against
which
she
said
no
word
,
but
constantly
rebelled
in
thought
and
deed
,
was
his
desire
that
the
servant
he
had
engaged
during
the
time
of
her
illness
to
take
charge
of
the
baby
,
should
always
carry
it
whenever
it
was
taken
out
for
a
walk
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
often
felt
,
now
she
was
strong
,
as
if
she
would
far
rather
have
been
without
the
responsibility
of
having
this
nursemaid
,
of
whom
she
was
,
in
reality
,
rather
afraid
.
<EOS>
The
good
side
of
it
was
that
it
set
her
at
liberty
to
attend
to
her
mother
at
times
when
she
would
have
been
otherwise
occupied
with
her
baby
;
but
Bell
required
very
little
from
any
one
:
<EOS>
she
was
easily
pleased
,
unexacting
,
and
methodical
even
in
her
dotage
;
preserving
the
quiet
,
undemonstrative
habits
of
her
earlier
life
now
that
the
faculty
of
reason
,
which
had
been
at
the
basis
of
the
formation
of
such
habits
,
was
gone
.
<EOS>
She
took
great
delight
in
watching
the
baby
,
and
was
pleased
to
have
it
in
her
care
for
a
short
time
;
but
she
dozed
so
much
that
it
prevented
her
having
any
strong
wish
on
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
So
Sylvia
contrived
to
get
her
baby
as
much
as
possible
to
herself
,
in
spite
of
the
nursemaid
;
and
,
above
all
,
she
would
carry
it
out
,
softly
cradled
in
her
arms
,
warm
pillowed
on
her
breast
,
and
bear
it
to
the
freedom
and
solitude
of
the
sea
-
shore
on
the
west
side
of
the
town
where
the
cliffs
were
not
so
high
,
and
there
was
a
good
space
of
sand
and
shingle
at
all
low
tides
.
  
<EOS>
Once
here
,
she
was
as
happy
as
she
ever
expected
to
be
in
this
world
.
<EOS>
The
fresh
sea
-
breeze
restored
something
of
the
colour
of
former
days
to
her
cheeks
,
the
old
buoyancy
to
her
spirits
;
here
she
might
talk
her
heart
-
full
of
loving
nonsense
to
her
baby
;
here
it
was
all
her
own
;
no
father
to
share
in
it
,
no
nursemaid
to
dispute
the
wisdom
of
anything
she
did
with
it
.
<EOS>
She
sang
to
it
<EOS>
,
she
tossed
it
;
it
crowed
and
it
laughed
back
again
,
till
both
were
weary
;
and
then
she
would
sit
down
on
a
broken
piece
of
rock
,
and
fall
to
gazing
on
the
advancing
waves
catching
the
sunlight
on
their
crests
,
advancing
,
receding
,
for
ever
and
for
ever
,
as
they
had
done
all
her
life
long
 
as
they
did
when
she
had
walked
with
them
that
once
by
the
side
of
Kinraid
;
those
cruel
waves
that
,
forgetful
of
the
happy
lovers
'
talk
by
the
side
of
their
waters
,
had
carried
one
away
,
and
drowned
him
deep
till
he
was
dead
.
<EOS>
Every
time
she
sate
down
to
look
at
the
sea
,
this
process
of
thought
was
gone
through
up
to
this
point
;
the
next
step
would
,
she
knew
,
bring
her
to
the
question
she
dared
not
,
must
not
ask
.
<EOS>
He
was
dead
;
he
must
be
dead
;
for
was
she
not
Philip
's
wife
?
<EOS>
Then
came
up
the
recollection
of
Philip
's
speech
,
never
forgotten
,
only
buried
out
of
sight
:
"
What
kind
of
a
woman
are
yo
'
to
go
on
dreaming
of
another
man
,
and
yo
'
a
wedded
wife
?
"
<EOS>
She
used
to
shudder
as
if
cold
steel
had
been
plunged
into
her
warm
,
living
body
as
she
remembered
these
words
;
cruel
words
,
harmlessly
provoked
.
<EOS>
They
were
too
much
associated
with
physical
pains
to
be
dwelt
upon
;
only
their
memory
was
always
there
.
<EOS>
She
paid
for
these
happy
rambles
with
her
baby
by
the
depression
which
awaited
her
on
her
re
-
entrance
into
the
dark
,
confined
house
that
was
her
home
;
its
very
fulness
of
comfort
was
an
oppression
.
<EOS>
Then
,
when
her
husband
saw
her
pale
and
fatigued
,
he
was
annoyed
,
and
sometimes
upbraided
her
for
doing
what
was
so
unnecessary
as
to
load
herself
with
her
child
.
<EOS>
She
knew
full
well
<EOS>
it
was
not
that
that
caused
her
weariness
.
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
,
when
he
inquired
and
discovered
that
all
these
walks
were
taken
in
one
direction
,
out
towards
the
sea
,
he
grew
jealous
of
her
love
for
the
inanimate
ocean
.
<EOS>
Was
it
connected
in
her
mind
with
the
thought
of
Kinraid
?
<EOS>
Why
did
she
so
perseveringly
,
in
wind
or
cold
,
go
out
to
the
sea
-
shore
;
the
western
side
,
too
,
where
,
if
she
went
but
far
enough
,
she
would
come
upon
the
mouth
of
the
Haytersbank
gully
,
the
point
at
which
she
had
last
seen
Kinraid
?
<EOS>
Such
fancies
haunted
Philip
's
mind
for
hours
after
she
had
acknowledged
the
direction
of
her
walks
.
<EOS>
But
he
never
said
a
word
that
could
distinctly
tell
her
he
disliked
her
going
to
the
sea
,
otherwise
she
would
have
obeyed
him
in
this
,
as
in
everything
else
;
for
absolute
obedience
to
her
husband
seemed
to
be
her
rule
of
life
at
this
period
 
obedience
to
him
who
would
so
gladly
have
obeyed
her
smallest
wish
<EOS>
had
she
but
expressed
it
!
<EOS>
She
never
knew
that
Philip
had
any
painful
association
with
the
particular
point
on
the
sea
-
shore
that
she
instinctively
avoided
,
both
from
a
consciousness
of
wifely
duty
,
and
also
because
the
sight
of
it
brought
up
so
much
sharp
pain
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
used
to
wonder
if
the
dream
that
preceded
her
illness
was
the
suggestive
cause
that
drew
her
so
often
to
the
shore
.
<EOS>
Her
illness
consequent
upon
that
dream
<EOS>
had
filled
his
mind
,
so
that
for
many
months
he
himself
had
had
no
haunting
vision
of
Kinraid
to
disturb
his
slumbers
.
<EOS>
But
now
the
old
dream
of
Kinraid
's
actual
presence
by
Philip
's
bedside
began
to
return
with
fearful
vividness
.
<EOS>
Night
after
night
it
recurred
;
each
time
with
some
new
touch
of
reality
,
and
close
approach
;
till
it
was
as
if
the
fate
that
overtakes
all
men
were
then
,
even
then
,
knocking
at
his
door
.
  
<EOS>
In
his
business
Philip
prospered
.
<EOS>
Men
praised
him
because
he
did
well
to
himself
.
<EOS>
He
had
the
perseverance
,
the
capability
for
head
-
work
and
calculation
,
the
steadiness
and
general
forethought
which
might
have
made
him
a
great
merchant
if
he
had
lived
in
a
large
city
.
<EOS>
Without
any
effort
of
his
own
,
almost
,
too
,
without
Coulson
's
being
aware
of
it
,
Philip
was
now
in
the
position
of
superior
partner
;
the
one
to
suggest
and
arrange
,
while
Coulson
only
carried
out
the
plans
that
emanated
from
Philip
.
<EOS>
The
whole
work
of
life
was
suited
to
the
man
:
he
did
not
aspire
to
any
different
position
,
only
to
the
full
development
of
the
capabilities
of
that
which
he
already
held
.
<EOS>
He
had
originated
several
fresh
schemes
with
regard
to
the
traffic
of
the
shop
;
and
his
old
masters
,
with
all
their
love
of
tried
ways
,
and
distrust
of
everything
new
,
had
been
candid
enough
to
confess
that
their
successors
'
plans
had
resulted
in
success
.
"
<EOS>
Their
successors
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Philip
was
content
with
having
the
power
when
the
exercise
of
it
was
required
,
and
never
named
his
own
important
share
in
the
new
improvements
.
<EOS>
Possibly
,
if
he
had
,
Coulson
's
vanity
might
have
taken
the
alarm
,
and
he
might
not
have
been
so
acquiescent
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
he
forgot
his
own
subordinate
share
,
and
always
used
the
imperial
"
we
"
<EOS>
,
"
we
thought
"
,
"
it
struck
us
,
"
&
c.
    
RESCUED
FROM
THE
WAVES
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
Hester
came
and
went
as
usual
;
in
so
quiet
and
methodical
a
way
,
with
so
even
and
undisturbed
a
temper
,
that
she
was
almost
forgotten
when
everything
went
well
in
the
shop
or
household
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
star
,
the
brightness
of
which
was
only
recognized
in
times
of
darkness
.
<EOS>
She
herself
was
almost
surprised
at
her
own
increasing
regard
for
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
thought
she
should
ever
be
able
to
love
the
woman
who
had
been
such
a
laggard
in
acknowledging
Philip
's
merits
;
and
from
all
she
had
ever
heard
of
Sylvia
before
she
came
to
know
her
,
from
the
angry
words
with
which
Sylvia
had
received
her
when
she
had
first
gone
to
Haytersbank
Farm
,
Hester
had
intended
to
remain
on
friendly
terms
,
but
to
avoid
intimacy
.
<EOS>
But
her
kindness
to
Bell
Robson
had
won
both
the
mother
's
and
daughter
's
hearts
;
and
in
spite
of
herself
,
certainly
against
her
own
mother
's
advice
,
she
had
become
the
familiar
friend
and
welcome
guest
of
the
household
.
  
<EOS>
Now
the
very
change
in
Sylvia
's
whole
manner
and
ways
,
which
grieved
and
vexed
Philip
,
made
his
wife
the
more
attractive
to
Hester
.
<EOS>
Brought
up
among
Quakers
,
although
not
one
herself
,
she
admired
and
respected
the
staidness
and
outward
peacefulness
common
amongst
the
young
women
of
that
sect
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
,
whom
she
had
expected
to
find
volatile
,
talkative
,
vain
,
and
wilful
,
was
quiet
and
still
,
as
if
she
had
been
born
a
Friend
<EOS>
:
she
seemed
to
have
no
will
of
her
own
;
she
served
her
mother
and
child
for
love
;
she
obeyed
her
husband
in
all
things
,
and
never
appeared
to
pine
after
gaiety
or
pleasure
.
<EOS>
And
yet
at
times
Hester
thought
,
or
rather
a
flash
came
across
her
mind
,
as
if
all
things
were
not
as
right
as
they
seemed
.
<EOS>
Philip
looked
older
,
more
care
-
worn
;
nay
,
even
Hester
was
obliged
to
allow
to
herself
that
she
had
heard
him
speak
to
his
wife
in
sharp
,
aggrieved
tones
.
<EOS>
Innocent
Hester
!
<EOS>
she
could
not
understand
how
the
very
qualities
she
so
admired
in
Sylvia
were
just
what
were
so
foreign
to
her
nature
that
the
husband
,
who
had
known
her
from
a
child
,
felt
what
an
unnatural
restraint
she
was
putting
upon
herself
,
and
would
have
hailed
petulant
words
or
wilful
actions
with
an
unspeakable
thankfulness
for
relief
.
  
<EOS>
One
day
 
it
was
in
the
spring
of
1798
 
<EOS>
Hester
was
engaged
to
stay
to
tea
with
the
Hepburns
,
in
order
that
after
that
early
meal
she
might
set
to
again
in
helping
Philip
and
Coulson
to
pack
away
the
winter
cloths
and
flannels
,
for
which
there
was
no
longer
any
use
.
<EOS>
The
tea
-
time
was
half
-
past
four
;
about
four
o'clock
a
heavy
April
shower
came
on
,
the
hail
pattering
against
the
window
-
panes
so
as
to
awaken
Mrs.
Robson
from
her
afternoon
's
nap
.
<EOS>
She
came
down
the
corkscrew
stairs
,
and
found
Phoebe
in
the
parlour
arranging
the
tea
-
things
.
  
<EOS>
Phoebe
and
Mrs.
Robson
were
better
friends
than
Phoebe
and
her
young
mistress
;
and
so
they
began
to
talk
a
little
together
in
a
comfortable
,
familiar
way
.
<EOS>
Once
or
twice
Philip
looked
in
,
as
if
he
would
be
glad
to
see
the
tea
-
table
in
readiness
;
and
then
Phoebe
would
put
on
a
spurt
of
busy
bustle
,
which
ceased
almost
as
soon
as
his
back
was
turned
,
<EOS>
so
eager
was
she
to
obtain
Mrs.
Robson
's
sympathy
in
some
little
dispute
that
had
occurred
between
her
and
the
nurse
-
maid
.
<EOS>
The
latter
had
misappropriated
some
hot
water
,
prepared
and
required
by
Phoebe
,
to
the
washing
of
the
baby
's
clothes
;
it
was
a
long
story
,
and
would
have
tired
the
patience
of
any
one
in
full
possession
of
their
senses
;
but
the
details
were
just
within
poor
Bell
's
comprehension
,
and
she
was
listening
with
the
greatest
sympathy
.
<EOS>
Both
the
women
were
unaware
of
the
lapse
of
time
;
but
it
was
of
consequence
to
Philip
,
as
the
extra
labour
was
not
to
be
begun
until
after
tea
,
and
the
daylight
hours
were
precious
.
  
<EOS>
At
a
quarter
to
five
Hester
and
he
came
in
,
and
then
Phoebe
began
to
hurry
.
<EOS>
Hester
went
up
to
sit
by
Bell
and
talk
to
her
.
<EOS>
Philip
spoke
to
Phoebe
in
the
familiar
words
of
country
-
folk
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
until
his
marriage
,
Phoebe
had
always
called
him
by
his
Christian
name
,
and
had
found
it
very
difficult
to
change
it
into
"
master
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
's
Sylvie
?
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gone
out
wi
'
t
'
babby
,
"
replied
Phoebe
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
ca
n't
Nancy
carry
it
out
?
"
asked
Philip
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
touching
on
the
old
grievance
:
he
was
tired
,
and
he
spoke
with
sharp
annoyance
.
<EOS>
Phoebe
might
easily
have
told
him
the
real
state
of
the
case
;
Nancy
was
busy
at
her
washing
,
which
would
have
been
reason
enough
.
<EOS>
But
the
nursemaid
had
vexed
her
,
and
she
did
not
like
Philip
's
sharpness
,
so
<EOS>
she
only
said
,
    
"
It
's
noane
o
'
my
business
;
it
's
yo
'
t
'
look
after
yo'r
own
wife
and
child
;
but
yo'r
but
a
lad
after
a
'
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
not
conciliatory
speech
,
and
just
put
the
last
stroke
to
Philip
's
fit
of
ill
-
temper
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
for
my
tea
to
-
night
,
"
said
he
,
to
Hester
,
when
all
was
ready
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Sylvie
's
not
here
,
and
nothing
is
nice
,
or
as
it
should
be
.
<EOS>
I
'll
go
and
set
to
on
t
'
stock
-
taking
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
yo
'
hurry
,
Hester
;
stop
and
chat
a
bit
with
th
'
old
lady
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
Philip
,
"
said
Hester
,
"
<EOS>
thou
's
sadly
tired
;
just
take
this
cup
o
'
tea
;
Sylvia
'll
be
grieved
if
yo
'
have
n't
something
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sylvia
does
n't
care
whether
I
'm
full
or
fasting
,
"
replied
he
,
impatiently
putting
aside
the
cup
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
she
did
she
'd
ha
'
taken
care
to
be
in
,
and
ha
'
seen
to
things
being
as
I
like
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Now
in
general
Philip
was
the
least
particular
of
men
about
meals
;
and
to
do
Sylvia
justice
,
she
was
scrupulously
attentive
to
every
household
duty
in
which
old
Phoebe
would
allow
her
to
meddle
,
and
always
careful
to
see
after
her
husband
's
comforts
.
<EOS>
But
Philip
was
too
vexed
at
her
absence
to
perceive
the
injustice
of
what
he
was
saying
,
nor
was
he
aware
how
Bell
Robson
had
been
attending
to
what
he
said
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
sadly
discomfited
by
it
,
understanding
just
enough
of
the
grievance
in
hand
to
think
that
her
daughter
was
neglectful
of
those
duties
which
she
herself
had
always
regarded
as
paramount
to
all
others
;
nor
could
Hester
convince
her
that
Philip
had
not
meant
what
he
said
;
neither
could
she
turn
the
poor
old
woman
's
thoughts
from
the
words
which
had
caused
her
distress
.
  
<EOS>
Presently
Sylvia
came
in
,
bright
and
cheerful
,
although
breathless
with
hurry
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
"
said
she
,
taking
off
her
wet
shawl
,
"
we
've
had
to
shelter
from
such
a
storm
of
rain
,
baby
and
me
 
but
see
!
<EOS>
she
's
none
the
worse
for
it
,
as
bonny
as
iver
,
bless
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hester
began
some
speech
of
admiration
for
the
child
in
order
to
prevent
Bell
from
delivering
the
lecture
she
felt
sure
was
coming
down
on
the
unsuspecting
Sylvia
;
but
all
in
vain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Philip
's
been
complaining
on
thee
,
Sylvie
,
"
said
Bell
,
in
the
way
in
which
she
had
spoken
to
her
daughter
when
she
was
a
little
child
;
grave
and
severe
in
tone
and
look
,
more
than
in
words
.
<EOS>
"
I
forget
justly
what
about
,
but
he
spoke
on
thy
neglecting
him
continual
.
<EOS>
It
's
not
right
,
my
lass
,
it
's
not
right
;
a
woman
should
 
<EOS>
but
my
head
's
very
tired
,
and
all
I
can
think
on
to
say
is
,
it
's
not
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Philip
been
complaining
of
me
,
and
to
mother
!
"
said
Sylvia
,
ready
to
burst
into
tears
,
<EOS>
so
grieved
and
angry
<EOS>
was
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
said
Hester
,
"
thy
mother
has
taken
it
a
little
too
strong
;
he
were
vexed
like
at
his
tea
not
being
ready
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
said
no
more
,
but
the
bright
colour
faded
from
her
cheek
,
and
the
contraction
of
care
returned
to
her
brow
.
<EOS>
She
occupied
herself
with
taking
off
her
baby
's
walking
things
.
<EOS>
Hester
lingered
,
anxious
to
soothe
and
make
peace
;
she
was
looking
sorrowfully
at
Sylvia
,
when
she
saw
tears
dropping
on
the
baby
's
cloak
,
and
then
it
seemed
as
if
she
must
speak
a
word
of
comfort
before
going
to
the
shop
-
work
,
where
she
knew
she
was
expected
by
both
Philip
and
Coulson
.
<EOS>
She
poured
out
a
cup
of
tea
,
and
coming
close
up
to
Sylvia
,
and
kneeling
down
by
her
,
she
whispered
,
    
"
Just
take
him
this
into
t
'
ware
-
room
;
it
'll
put
all
to
rights
if
thou'll
take
it
to
him
wi
'
thy
own
hands
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
looked
up
,
and
Hester
then
more
fully
saw
how
she
had
been
crying
.
<EOS>
She
whispered
in
reply
,
for
fear
of
disturbing
her
mother
,
    
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mind
anything
but
his
speaking
ill
on
me
to
mother
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
'm
for
iver
trying
and
trying
to
be
a
good
wife
to
him
,
an
'
it
's
very
dull
work
;
harder
than
yo
'
think
on
,
Hester
,
 
an
'
I
would
ha
'
been
home
for
tea
to
-
night
<EOS>
only
I
was
afeared
of
baby
getting
wet
<EOS>
wi
'
t
'
storm
o
'
hail
as
we
had
down
on
t
'
shore
;
and
we
sheltered
under
a
rock
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
weary
coming
home
to
this
dark
place
,
and
to
find
my
own
mother
set
against
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Take
him
his
tea
,
like
a
good
lassie
.
<EOS>
I
'll
answer
for
it
<EOS>
he
'll
be
all
right
.
<EOS>
A
man
takes
it
hardly
when
he
comes
in
tired
,
a
-
thinking
his
wife
'll
be
there
to
cheer
him
up
a
bit
,
to
find
her
off
,
and
niver
know
nought
of
t
'
reason
why
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
glad
enough
I
've
getten
a
baby
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
"
<EOS>
but
for
aught
else
I
wish
I
'd
niver
been
married
,
I
do
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
thee
,
lass
!
<EOS>
"
said
Hester
,
rising
up
indignant
;
"
now
that
is
a
sin
.
<EOS>
Eh
!
<EOS>
if
thou
only
knew
the
lot
o
'
some
folk
.
<EOS>
But
let
's
talk
no
more
on
that
,
that
can
not
be
helped
;
go
,
take
him
his
tea
,
for
it
's
a
sad
thing
to
think
on
him
fasting
all
this
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hester
's
voice
was
raised
by
the
simple
fact
of
her
change
of
position
;
and
the
word
fasting
caught
Mrs.
Robson
's
ear
,
as
she
sate
at
her
knitting
by
the
chimney
-
corner
.
  
<EOS>
"
Fasting
?
<EOS>
he
said
thou
did
n't
care
if
he
were
full
or
fasting
.
<EOS>
Lassie
!
<EOS>
it
's
not
right
in
thee
,
I
say
;
go
,
take
him
his
tea
at
once
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
rose
,
and
gave
up
the
baby
,
which
she
had
been
suckling
,
to
Nancy
,
who
having
done
her
washing
,
had
come
for
her
charge
,
to
put
it
to
bed
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
kissed
it
fondly
,
making
a
little
moan
of
sad
,
passionate
tenderness
as
she
did
so
.
<EOS>
Then
she
took
the
cup
of
tea
;
but
she
said
,
rather
defiantly
,
to
Hester
,
    
"
I
'll
go
to
him
with
it
,
because
mother
bids
me
,
and
it
'll
ease
her
mind
.
"
  
<EOS>
Then
louder
to
her
mother
,
she
added
,
    
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
I
'll
take
him
his
tea
,
though
I
could
n't
help
the
being
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
If
the
act
itself
was
conciliatory
,
the
spirit
in
which
she
was
going
to
do
it
was
the
reverse
.
<EOS>
Hester
followed
her
slowly
into
the
ware
-
room
,
with
intentional
delay
,
thinking
that
her
presence
might
be
an
obstacle
to
their
mutually
understanding
one
another
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
held
the
cup
and
plate
of
bread
and
butter
out
to
Philip
,
but
avoided
meeting
his
eye
,
and
said
not
a
word
of
explanation
,
or
regret
,
or
self
-
justification
.
<EOS>
If
she
had
spoken
,
though
ever
so
crossly
,
Philip
would
have
been
relieved
,
and
would
have
preferred
it
to
her
silence
.
<EOS>
He
wanted
to
provoke
her
to
speech
,
but
did
not
know
how
to
begin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thou
's
been
out
again
wandering
on
that
sea
-
shore
!
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
answer
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
think
what
's
always
taking
thee
there
,
when
one
would
ha
'
thought
a
walk
up
to
Esdale
would
be
far
more
sheltered
,
both
for
thee
and
baby
in
such
weather
as
this
.
<EOS>
Thou'll
be
having
that
baby
ill
some
of
these
days
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
At
this
,
she
looked
up
at
him
,
and
her
lips
moved
as
though
she
were
going
to
say
something
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
how
he
wished
she
would
,
that
they
might
come
to
a
wholesome
quarrel
,
and
a
making
friends
again
,
and
a
tender
kissing
,
in
which
he
might
whisper
penitence
for
all
his
hasty
words
,
or
unreasonable
vexation
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
come
resolved
not
to
speak
,
for
fear
of
showing
too
much
passion
,
too
much
emotion
.
<EOS>
Only
as
she
was
going
away
she
turned
and
said
,
    
"
Philip
,
mother
has
n't
many
more
years
to
live
;
dunnot
grieve
her
,
and
set
her
again
'
me
by
finding
fault
wi
'
<EOS>
me
afore
her
.
<EOS>
Our
being
we
d
were
a
great
mistake
;
but
before
t
'
poor
old
widow
woman
let
us
make
as
if
we
were
happy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sylvie
!
Sylvie
!
"
<EOS>
he
called
after
her
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
heard
,
but
she
did
not
turn
.
<EOS>
He
went
after
her
,
and
seized
her
by
the
arm
rather
roughly
;
she
had
stung
him
to
the
heart
with
her
calm
words
,
which
seemed
to
reveal
a
long
-
formed
conviction
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sylvie
!
<EOS>
"
said
he
,
almost
fiercely
,
"
what
do
yo
'
mean
by
what
you
've
said
?
<EOS>
Speak
!
<EOS>
I
will
have
an
answer
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
almost
shook
her
:
<EOS>
she
was
half
frightened
by
his
vehemence
of
behaviour
,
which
she
took
for
pure
anger
,
while
it
was
the
outburst
of
agonized
and
unrequited
love
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
go
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
Philip
,
yo
'
hurt
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
Just
at
this
moment
Hester
came
up
;
Philip
was
ashamed
of
his
passionate
ways
in
her
serene
presence
,
and
loosened
his
grasp
of
his
wife
,
and
she
ran
away
;
ran
into
her
mother
's
empty
room
,
as
to
a
solitary
place
,
and
there
burst
into
that
sobbing
,
miserable
crying
which
we
instinctively
know
is
too
surely
lessening
the
length
of
our
days
on
earth
to
be
indulged
in
often
.
  
<EOS>
When
she
had
exhausted
that
first
burst
and
lay
weak
and
quiet
for
a
time
,
she
listened
in
dreading
expectation
of
the
sound
of
his
footstep
coming
in
search
of
her
to
make
friends
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
detained
below
on
business
,
and
never
came
.
<EOS>
Instead
,
her
mother
came
clambering
up
the
stairs
;
she
was
now
in
the
habit
of
going
to
bed
between
seven
and
eight
,
and
to
-
night
she
was
retiring
at
even
an
earlier
hour
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
sprang
up
and
drew
down
the
window
-
blind
,
and
made
her
face
and
manner
as
composed
as
possible
,
in
order
to
soothe
and
comfort
her
mother
's
last
waking
hours
.
<EOS>
She
helped
her
to
bed
with
gentle
patience
;
the
restraint
imposed
upon
her
by
her
tender
filial
love
was
good
for
her
,
though
all
the
time
she
was
longing
to
be
alone
to
have
another
wild
outburst
.
<EOS>
When
her
mother
was
going
off
to
sleep
,
Sylvia
went
to
look
at
her
baby
,
also
in
a
soft
sleep
.
<EOS>
Then
she
gazed
out
at
the
evening
sky
,
high
above
the
tiled
roofs
of
the
opposite
houses
,
and
the
longing
to
be
out
under
the
peaceful
heavens
took
possession
of
her
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
my
only
comfort
,
"
said
she
to
herself
;
"
and
there
's
no
earthly
harm
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
would
ha
'
been
at
home
to
his
tea
,
if
I
could
;
but
when
he
does
n't
want
me
,
and
mother
does
n't
want
me
,
and
baby
is
either
in
my
arms
or
asleep
;
why
,
I
'll
go
any
cry
<EOS>
my
fill
out
under
yon
great
quiet
sky
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
stay
in
t
'
house
to
be
choked
up
wi
'
my
tears
,
nor
yet
to
have
him
coming
about
me
either
for
scolding
or
peace
-
making
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
she
put
on
her
things
and
went
out
again
;
this
time
along
the
High
Street
,
and
up
the
long
flights
of
steps
towards
the
parish
church
,
and
there
she
stood
and
thought
that
here
she
had
first
met
Kinraid
,
at
Darley
's
burying
,
and
she
tried
to
recall
the
very
look
of
<EOS>
all
the
sad
,
earnest
faces
round
the
open
grave
 
<EOS>
the
whole
scene
,
in
fact
;
and
let
herself
give
way
to
the
miserable
regrets
she
had
so
often
tried
to
control
.
<EOS>
Then
she
walked
on
,
crying
bitterly
,
<EOS>
almost
unawares
to
herself
;
on
through
the
high
,
bleak
fields
at
the
summit
of
the
cliffs
;
fields
bounded
by
loose
stone
fences
,
and
far
from
all
sight
of
the
habitation
of
man
.
<EOS>
But
,
below
,
the
sea
rose
and
raged
;
it
was
high
water
at
the
highest
tide
,
and
the
wind
blew
gustily
from
the
land
,
vainly
combating
the
great
waves
that
came
invincibly
up
with
a
roar
and
an
impotent
furious
dash
against
the
base
of
the
cliffs
below
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
heard
the
sound
of
the
passionate
rush
and
rebound
of
many
waters
,
like
the
shock
of
mighty
guns
,
whenever
the
other
sound
of
the
blustering
gusty
wind
was
lulled
for
an
instant
.
<EOS>
She
was
more
quieted
by
this
tempest
of
the
elements
than
she
would
have
been
had
all
nature
seemed
as
still
as
she
had
imagined
it
to
be
while
she
was
yet
in
-
doors
and
only
saw
a
part
of
the
serene
sky
.
  
<EOS>
She
fixed
on
a
certain
point
,
in
her
own
mind
,
which
she
would
reach
,
and
then
turn
back
again
.
<EOS>
It
was
where
the
outline
of
the
land
curved
inwards
,
dipping
into
a
little
bay
.
<EOS>
Here
the
field
-
path
she
had
hitherto
followed
descended
somewhat
abruptly
to
a
cluster
of
fishermen
's
cottages
,
hardly
large
enough
to
be
called
a
village
;
and
then
the
narrow
roadway
wound
up
the
rising
ground
till
it
again
reached
the
summit
of
the
cliffs
that
stretched
along
the
coast
for
many
and
many
a
mile
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
said
to
herself
that
she
would
turn
homewards
when
she
came
within
sight
of
this
cove
,
 
Headlington
Cove
,
they
called
it
.
<EOS>
All
the
way
along
she
had
met
no
one
since
she
had
left
the
town
,
but
just
as
she
had
got
over
the
last
stile
,
or
ladder
of
stepping
-
stones
,
into
the
field
from
which
the
path
descended
,
she
came
upon
a
number
of
people
 
quite
a
crowd
,
in
fact
;
men
moving
forward
in
a
steady
line
,
hauling
at
a
rope
,
a
chain
,
or
something
of
that
kind
;
boys
,
children
,
and
women
holding
babies
in
their
arms
,
as
if
all
were
fain
to
come
out
and
partake
in
some
general
interest
.
  
<EOS>
They
kept
within
a
certain
distance
from
the
edge
of
the
cliff
,
and
Sylvia
,
advancing
a
little
,
now
saw
the
reason
why
.
<EOS>
The
great
cable
the
men
held
was
attached
to
some
part
of
a
smack
,
which
could
now
be
seen
by
her
in
the
waters
below
,
half
dismantled
,
and
all
but
a
wreck
,
yet
with
her
deck
covered
with
living
men
,
as
far
as
the
waning
light
would
allow
her
to
see
.
<EOS>
The
vessel
strained
to
get
free
of
the
strong
guiding
cable
;
the
tide
was
turning
,
the
wind
was
blowing
off
shore
,
and
Sylvia
knew
without
being
told
,
that
almost
parallel
to
this
was
a
line
of
sunken
rocks
that
had
been
fatal
to
many
a
ship
before
now
,
if
she
had
tried
to
take
the
inner
channel
instead
of
keeping
out
to
sea
for
miles
,
and
then
steering
in
straight
for
Monkshaven
port
.
<EOS>
And
the
ships
that
had
been
thus
lost
had
been
in
good
plight
and
order
compared
to
this
vessel
,
which
seemed
nothing
but
a
hull
without
mast
or
sail
.
  
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
the
crowd
 
the
fishermen
from
the
hamlet
down
below
,
with
their
wives
and
children
 
all
had
come
but
<EOS>
the
bedridden
 
had
reached
the
place
where
Sylvia
stood
.
<EOS>
The
women
,
in
a
state
of
wild
excitement
,
rushed
on
,
encouraging
their
husbands
and
sons
by
words
,
even
while
they
hindered
them
by
actions
;
and
,
from
time
to
time
,
one
of
them
would
run
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
shout
out
some
brave
words
of
hope
in
her
shrill
voice
to
the
crew
on
the
deck
below
.
<EOS>
Whether
these
latter
heard
it
or
not
,
no
one
could
tell
;
but
it
seemed
as
if
all
human
voice
must
be
lost
in
the
tempestuous
stun
and
tumult
of
wind
and
wave
.
<EOS>
It
was
generally
a
woman
with
a
child
in
her
arms
who
so
employed
herself
.
<EOS>
As
the
strain
upon
the
cable
became
greater
,
and
the
ground
on
which
they
strove
more
uneven
,
every
hand
was
needed
to
hold
and
push
,
and
all
those
women
who
were
unencumbered
held
by
the
dear
rope
on
which
so
many
lives
were
depending
.
<EOS>
On
they
came
,
a
long
line
of
human
beings
,
black
against
the
ruddy
sunset
sky
.
<EOS>
As
they
came
near
Sylvia
,
a
woman
cried
out
,
    
"
Dunnot
stand
idle
,
lass
,
but
houd
on
wi
'
us
;
there
's
many
a
bonny
life
at
stake
,
and
many
a
mother
's
heart
a
-
hangin
'
on
this
bit
o
'
hemp
.
<EOS>
Tak
'
houd
,
lass
,
and
give
a
firm
grip
,
and
God
remember
thee
i
'
thy
need
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
needed
no
second
word
;
a
place
was
made
for
her
,
and
in
an
instant
more
the
rope
was
pulling
against
her
hands
till
it
seemed
as
though
she
was
holding
fire
in
her
bare
palms
.
<EOS>
Never
a
one
of
them
thought
of
letting
go
for
an
instant
,
though
when
all
was
over
<EOS>
many
of
their
hands
were
raw
and
bleeding
.
<EOS>
Some
strong
,
experienced
fishermen
passed
a
word
along
the
line
from
time
to
time
,
giving
directions
as
to
how
it
should
be
held
according
to
varying
occasions
;
but
few
among
the
rest
had
breath
or
strength
enough
to
speak
.
<EOS>
The
women
and
children
that
accompanied
them
ran
on
before
,
breaking
down
the
loose
stone
fences
,
so
as
to
obviate
delay
or
hindrance
;
they
talked
continually
,
exhorting
,
encouraging
,
explaining
.
<EOS>
From
their
many
words
and
fragmentary
sentences
,
Sylvia
learnt
that
the
vessel
was
supposed
to
be
a
Newcastle
smack
sailing
from
London
,
that
had
taken
the
dangerous
inner
channel
to
save
time
,
and
had
been
caught
in
the
storm
,
which
she
was
too
crazy
to
withstand
;
and
that
if
by
some
daring
contrivance
of
the
fishermen
who
had
first
seen
her
the
cable
had
not
been
got
ashore
,
she
would
have
been
cast
upon
the
rocks
before
this
,
and
"
all
on
board
perished
"
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
were
dayleet
then
,
"
quoth
one
woman
;
"
a
could
see
their
faces
,
they
were
so
near
.
<EOS>
They
were
as
pale
as
dead
men
,
an
'
one
was
prayin
'
down
on
his
knees
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
king
's
officer
aboard
,
for
I
saw
t
'
gowd
about
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
'd
maybe
come
from
these
hom'ard
parts
,
and
be
comin
'
to
see
his
own
folk
;
else
it
's
no
common
for
king
's
officers
to
sail
in
aught
but
king
's
ships
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Eh
!
<EOS>
but
it
's
gettin
'
dark
!
<EOS>
See
there
's
t
'
leeghts
in
t
'
houses
in
t
'
New
Town

<EOS>
T

'
wi
'
t

white

under

<EOS>
It
'll
be
a
hard

round
t

point
,
and
then
she
'll
be
gettin

into
still
waters
.
<EOS>
"
  
One
more
great
push
and
mighty
strain
,
and
the
danger
was
past
;
the
vessel
 
or
what
remained
of
her
 
was
in
the
harbour
,
among
the
lights
and
cheerful
sounds
of
safety
.
<EOS>
The
fishermen
sprang
down
the
cliff
to
the
quay
-
side
,
anxious
to
see
the
men
whose
lives
they
had
saved
;
the
women
,
weary
and
over
-
excited
,
began
to
cry
.
<EOS>
Not
Sylvia
,
however
;
her
fount
of
tears
had
been
exhausted
earlier
in
the
day
:
her
principal
feeling
was
of
gladness
and
high
rejoicing
that
they
were
saved
who
had
been
so
near
to
death
not
half
an
hour
before
.
  
<EOS>
She
would
have
liked
to
have
seen
the
men
,
and
shaken
hands
with
them
all
round
.
<EOS>
But
instead
she
must
go
home
,
and
well
would
it
be
with
her
if
she
was
in
time
for
her
husband
's
supper
,
and
escaped
any
notice
of
her
absence
.
<EOS>
So
she
separated
herself
from
the
groups
of
women
who
sate
on
the
grass
in
the
churchyard
,
awaiting
the
return
of
such
of
their
husbands
as
could
resist
the
fascinations
of
the
Monkshaven
public
houses
.
<EOS>
As
Sylvia
went
down
the
church
steps
,
she
came
upon
one
of
the
fishermen
who
had
helped
to
tow
the
vessel
into
port
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
was
seventeen
men
and
boys
aboard
her
,
and
a
navy
-
lieutenant
as
had
comed
as
passenger
.
<EOS>
It
were
a
good
job
as
we
could
manage
her
.
<EOS>
Good
-
neet
to
thee
,
thou'll
sleep
all
t
'
sounder
for
havin'
lent
a
hand
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
street
air
felt
hot
and
close
after
the
sharp
keen
atmosphere
of
the
heights
above
;
the
decent
shops
and
houses
had
all
their
shutters
put
up
,
and
were
preparing
for
their
early
bed
-
time
.
<EOS>
Already
lights
shone
here
and
there
in
the
upper
chambers
,
and
Sylvia
scarcely
met
any
one
.
  
<EOS>
She
went
round
up
the
passage
from
the
quay
-
side
,
and
in
by
the
private
door
.
<EOS>
All
was
still
;
the
basins
of
bread
and
milk
that
she
and
her
husband
were
in
the
habit
of
having
for
supper
stood
in
the
fender
before
the
fire
,
each
with
a
plate
upon
them
.
<EOS>
Nancy
had
gone
to
bed
,
Phoebe
dozed
in
the
kitchen
;
Philip
was
still
in
the
ware
-
room
,
arranging
goods
and
taking
stock
along
with
Coulson
,
for
Hester
had
gone
home
to
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
was
not
willing
to
go
and
seek
out
Philip
,
after
the
manner
in
which
they
had
parted
.
<EOS>
All
the
despondency
of
her
life
became
present
to
her
again
as
she
sate
down
within
her
home
.
<EOS>
She
had
forgotten
it
in
her
interest
and
excitement
,
but
now
it
came
back
again
.
  
<EOS>
Still
she
was
hungry
,
and
youthful
,
and
tired
.
<EOS>
She
took
her
basin
up
,
and
was
eating
her
supper
when
she
heard
a
cry
of
her
baby
upstairs
,
and
ran
away
to
attend
to
it
.
<EOS>
When
it
had
been
fed
and
hushed
away
to
sleep
,
she
went
in
to
see
her
mother
,
attracted
by
some
unusual
noise
in
her
room
.
  
<EOS>
She
found
Mrs.
Robson
awake
,
and
restless
,
and
ailing
;
dwelling
much
on
what
Philip
had
said
in
his
anger
against
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
It
was
really
necessary
for
her
daughter
to
remain
with
her
;
so
Sylvia
stole
out
,
and
went
quickly
down
-
stairs
to
Philip
 
now
sitting
tired
and
worn
out
,
and
eating
his
supper
with
little
or
no
appetite
 
and
told
him
she
meant
to
pass
the
night
with
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
His
answer
of
acquiescence
was
so
short
and
careless
,
or
so
it
seemed
to
her
,
that
she
did
not
tell
him
any
more
of
what
she
had
done
or
seen
that
evening
,
or
even
dwell
upon
any
details
of
her
mother
's
indisposition
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
she
had
left
the
room
,
Philip
set
down
his
half
-
finished
basin
of
bread
and
milk
,
and
sate
long
,
his
face
hidden
in
his
folded
arms
.
<EOS>
The
wick
of
the
candle
grew
long
and
black
,
and
fell
,
and
sputtered
,
and
guttered
;
he
sate
on
,
unheeding
either
it
or
the
pale
gray
fire
that
was
dying
out
 
dead
at
last
.
    
<EOS>
AN
APPARITION
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Robson
was
very
poorly
all
night
long
.
<EOS>
Uneasy
thoughts
seemed
to
haunt
and
perplex
her
brain
,
and
she
neither
slept
nor
woke
,
but
was
restless
and
uneasy
in
her
talk
and
movements
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
lay
down
by
her
,
but
got
so
little
sleep
,
that
at
length
she
preferred
sitting
in
the
easy
-
chair
by
the
bedside
.
<EOS>
Here
she
dropped
off
to
slumber
in
spite
of
herself
;
the
scene
of
the
evening
before
seemed
to
be
repeated
;
the
cries
of
the
many
people
,
the
heavy
roar
and
dash
of
the
threatening
waves
,
were
repeated
in
her
ears
;
and
something
was
said
to
her
through
all
the
conflicting
noises
,
 
what
it
was
she
could
not
catch
,
though
she
strained
to
hear
the
hoarse
murmur
that
,
in
her
dream
,
she
believed
to
convey
a
meaning
of
the
utmost
importance
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
This
dream
,
that
mysterious
,
only
half
-
intelligible
sound
,
recurred
whenever
she
dozed
,
and
her
inability
to
hear
the
words
uttered
distressed
her
so
much
,
that
at
length
she
sate
bolt
upright
,
resolved
to
sleep
no
more
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
was
talking
in
a
half
-
conscious
way
;
Philip
's
speech
of
the
evening
before
was
evidently
running
in
her
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sylvie
,
if
thou're
not
a
good
wife
to
him
,
it
'll
just
break
my
heart
outright
.
<EOS>
A
woman
should
obey
her
husband
,
and
not
go
her
own
gait
.
<EOS>
I
never
leave
the
house
wi'out
<EOS>
telling
father
,
and
getting
his
leave
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
then
she
began
to
cry
pitifully
,
and
to
say
unconnected
things
,
till
Sylvia
,
to
soothe
her
,
took
her
hand
,
and
promised
never
to
leave
the
house
without
asking
her
husband
's
permission
,
though
in
making
this
promise
,
she
felt
as
if
she
were
sacrificing
her
last
pleasure
to
her
mother
's
wish
;
for
she
knew
well
enough
that
Philip
would
always
raise
objections
to
the
rambles
which
reminded
her
of
her
old
free
open
-
air
life
.
  
<EOS>
But
to
comfort
and
cherish
her
mother
she
would
have
done
anything
;
yet
this
very
morning
that
was
dawning
,
she
must
go
and
ask
his
permission
for
a
simple
errand
,
or
break
her
word
.
  
<EOS>
She
knew
from
experience
that
nothing
quieted
her
mother
so
well
as
balm
-
tea
;
it
might
be
that
the
herb
really
possessed
some
sedative
power
;
it
might
be
only
early
faith
,
and
often
repeated
experience
,
but
it
had
always
had
a
tranquillizing
effect
;
and
more
than
once
,
during
the
restless
hours
of
the
night
,
Mrs.
Robson
had
asked
for
it
;
but
Sylvia
's
stock
of
last
year
's
dead
leaves
was
exhausted
.
<EOS>
Still
she
knew
where
a
plant
of
balm
grew
in
the
sheltered
corner
of
Haytersbank
Farm
garden
;
she
knew
that
the
tenants
who
had
succeeded
them
in
the
occupation
of
the
farm
had
had
to
leave
it
in
consequence
of
a
death
,
and
that
the
place
was
unoccupied
;
and
in
the
darkness
she
had
planned
that
if
she
could
leave
her
mother
after
the
dawn
came
,
and
she
had
attended
to
her
baby
,
she
would
walk
quickly
to
the
old
garden
,
and
gather
the
tender
sprigs
which
she
was
sure
to
find
there
.
  
<EOS>
Now
she
must
go
and
ask
Philip
;
and
till
she
held
her
baby
to
her
breast
,
she
bitterly
wished
that
she
were
free
from
the
duties
and
chains
of
matrimony
.
<EOS>
But
the
touch
of
its
waxen
fingers
,
the
hold
of
its
little
mouth
,
made
her
relax
into
docility
and
gentleness
.
<EOS>
She
gave
it
back
to
Nancy
to
be
dressed
,
and
softly
opened
the
door
of
Philip
's
bed
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Philip
!
"
said
she
,
gently
.
"
<EOS>
Philip
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
started
up
from
dreams
of
her
;
of
her
,
angry
.
<EOS>
He
saw
her
there
,
rather
pale
with
her
night
's
watch
and
anxiety
,
but
looking
meek
,
and
a
little
beseeching
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
has
had
such
a
bad
night
!
<EOS>
she
fancied
once
as
some
balm
-
tea
would
do
her
good
 
<EOS>
it
allays
used
to
:
<EOS>
but
my
dried
balm
is
all
gone
,
and
I
thought
there
'd
be
sure
to
be
some
in
t
'
old
garden
at
Haytersbank
.
<EOS>
Feyther
planted
a
bush
just
for
mother
,
wheere
it
allays
came
up
early
,
nigh
t
'
old
elder
-
tree
;
and
if
yo'd
not
mind
,
I
could
run
theere
while
she
sleeps
,
and
be
back
again
in
an
hour
,
and
it
's
not
seven
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thou
's
not
wear
thyself
out
with
running
,
Sylvie
,
"
said
Philip
,
eagerly
;
"
I
'll
get
up
and
go
myself
,
or
,
perhaps
,
"
continued
he
,
catching
the
shadow
that
was
coming
over
her
face
,
"
thou'd
rather
go
thyself
<EOS>
:
it
's
only
that
I
'm
so
afraid
of
thy
tiring
thyself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
'll
not
tire
me
,
"
said
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Afore
I
was
married
,
I
was
out
often
far
farther
than
that
,
afield
to
fetch
up
t
'
kine
,
before
my
breakfast
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
go
if
thou
will
,
"
said
Philip
.
<EOS>
"
But
get
somewhat
to
eat
first
,
and
do
n't
hurry
;
there
's
no
need
for
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
had
got
her
hat
and
shawl
,
and
was
off
before
he
had
finished
his
last
words
.
  
<EOS>
The
long
High
Street
was
almost
empty
of
people
at
that
early
hour
;
one
side
was
entirely
covered
by
the
cool
morning
shadow
which
lay
on
the
pavement
,
and
crept
up
the
opposite
houses
till
only
the
topmost
story
caught
the
rosy
sunlight
.
<EOS>
Up
the
hill
-
road
,
through
the
gap
in
the
stone
wall
,
across
the
dewy
fields
,
Sylvia
went
by
the
very
shortest
path
she
knew
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
only
once
been
at
Haytersbank
since
her
wedding
-
day
.
<EOS>
On
that
occasion
the
place
had
seemed
strangely
and
dissonantly
changed
by
the
numerous
children
who
were
diverting
themselves
before
the
open
door
,
and
whose
playthings
and
clothes
strewed
the
house
-
place
,
and
made
it
one
busy
scene
of
confusion
and
untidiness
,
more
like
the
Corneys
'
kitchen
in
former
times
,
than
her
mother
's
orderly
and
quiet
abode
.
<EOS>
Those
little
children
were
fatherless
now
;
and
the
house
was
shut
up
,
awaiting
the
entry
of
some
new
tenant
.
<EOS>
There
were
no
shutters
to
shut
;
the
long
low
window
was
blinking
in
the
rays
of
the
morning
sun
;
the
house
and
cow
-
house
doors
were
closed
,
and
no
poultry
wandered
about
the
field
in
search
of
stray
grains
of
corn
,
or
early
worms
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
strange
and
unfamiliar
silence
,
and
struck
solemnly
on
Sylvia
's
mind
.
<EOS>
Only
a
thrush
in
the
old
orchard
down
in
the
hollow
,
out
of
sight
,
whistled
and
gurgled
with
continual
shrill
melody
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
went
slowly
past
the
house
and
down
the
path
leading
to
the
wild
,
deserted
bit
of
garden
.
<EOS>
She
saw
that
the
last
tenants
had
had
a
pump
sunk
for
them
,
and
resented
the
innovation
,
as
though
the
well
she
was
passing
could
feel
the
insult
.
<EOS>
Over
it
grew
two
hawthorn
trees
;
on
the
bent
trunk
of
one
of
them
she
used
to
sit
,
long
ago
:
the
charm
of
the
position
being
enhanced
by
the
possible
danger
of
falling
into
the
well
and
being
drowned
.
<EOS>
The
rusty
unused
chain
was
wound
round
the
windlass
;
the
bucket
was
falling
to
pieces
from
dryness
.
<EOS>
A
lean
cat
came
from
some
outhouse
,
and
mewed
pitifully
with
hunger
;
accompanying
Sylvia
to
the
garden
,
as
if
glad
of
some
human
companionship
,
yet
refusing
to
allow
itself
to
be
touched
.
<EOS>
Primroses
grew
in
the
sheltered
places
,
just
as
they
formerly
did
;
and
made
the
uncultivated
ground
seem
less
deserted
than
the
garden
,
where
the
last
year
's
weeds
were
rotting
away
,
and
cumbering
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
forced
her
way
through
the
berry
bushes
to
the
herb
-
plot
,
and
plucked
the
tender
leaves
she
had
come
to
seek
;
sighing
a
little
all
the
time
.
<EOS>
Then
she
retraced
her
steps
;
paused
softly
before
the
house
-
door
,
and
entered
the
porch
and
kissed
the
senseless
wood
.
  
<EOS>
She
tried
to
tempt
the
poor
gaunt
cat
into
her
arms
,
meaning
to
carry
it
home
and
befriend
it
;
but
it
was
scared
by
her
endeavour
and
ran
back
to
its
home
in
the
outhouse
,
making
a
green
path
across
the
white
dew
of
the
meadow
.
<EOS>
Then
Sylvia
began
to
hasten
home
,
thinking
,
and
remembering
 
at
the
stile
that
led
into
the
road
she
was
brought
short
up
.
  
<EOS>
Some
one
stood
in
the
lane
just
on
the
other
side
of
the
gap
;
his
back
was
to
the
morning
sun
;
all
she
saw
at
first
was
the
uniform
of
a
naval
officer
,
so
well
known
in
Monkshaven
in
those
days
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
went
hurrying
past
him
,
not
looking
again
,
although
her
clothes
almost
brushed
his
,
as
he
stood
there
still
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
gone
a
yard
 
<EOS>
no
,
not
half
a
yard
 
when
her
heart
leaped
up
and
fell
again
dead
within
her
,
as
if
she
had
been
shot
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sylvia
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
in
a
voice
tremulous
with
joy
and
passionate
love
.
"
<EOS>
Sylvia
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
round
;
he
had
turned
a
little
,
so
that
the
light
fell
straight
on
his
face
.
<EOS>
It
was
bronzed
,
and
the
lines
were
strengthened
;
but
it
was
the
same
face
she
had
last
seen
in
Haytersbank
Gully
three
long
years
ago
,
and
had
never
thought
to
see
in
life
again
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
close
to
her
and
held
out
his
fond
arms
;
she
went
fluttering
towards
their
embrace
,
as
if
drawn
by
the
old
fascination
;
but
when
she
felt
them
close
round
her
,
she
started
away
,
and
cried
out
with
a
great
pitiful
shriek
,
and
put
her
hands
up
to
her
forehead
as
if
trying
to
clear
away
some
bewildering
mist
.
  
<EOS>
Then
she
looked
at
him
once
more
,
a
terrible
story
in
her
eyes
,
if
he
could
but
have
read
it
.
  
<EOS>
Twice
she
opened
her
stiff
lips
to
speak
,
and
twice
the
words
were
overwhelmed
by
the
surges
of
her
misery
,
which
bore
them
back
into
the
depths
of
her
heart
.
  
<EOS>
He
thought
that
he
had
come
upon
her
too
suddenly
,
and
he
attempted
to
soothe
her
with
soft
murmurs
of
love
,
and
to
woo
her
to
his
outstretched
hungry
arms
once
more
.
<EOS>
But
when
she
saw
this
motion
of
his
,
she
made
a
gesture
as
though
pushing
him
away
;
and
with
an
inarticulate
moan
of
agony
she
put
her
hands
to
her
head
once
more
,
and
turning
away
began
to
run
blindly
towards
the
town
for
protection
.
  
<EOS>
For
a
minute
<EOS>
or
so
he
was
stunned
with
surprise
at
her
behaviour
;
and
then
he
thought
it
accounted
for
by
the
shock
of
his
accost
,
and
that
she
needed
time
to
understand
the
unexpected
joy
.
<EOS>
So
he
followed
her
swiftly
,
ever
keeping
her
in
view
,
but
not
trying
to
overtake
her
too
speedily
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
frightened
my
poor
love
,
"
he
kept
thinking
.
<EOS>
And
by
this
thought
he
tried
to
repress
his
impatience
and
check
the
speed
he
longed
to
use
;
yet
he
was
always
so
near
behind
that
her
quickened
sense
heard
his
well
-
known
footsteps
following
,
and
a
mad
notion
flashed
across
her
brain
that
she
would
go
to
the
wide
full
river
,
and
end
the
hopeless
misery
she
felt
enshrouding
her
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
sure
hiding
-
place
from
all
human
reproach
and
heavy
mortal
woe
beneath
the
rushing
waters
borne
landwards
by
the
morning
tide
.
  
<EOS>
No
one
can
tell
what
changed
her
course
;
perhaps
the
thought
of
her
sucking
child
;
perhaps
her
mother
;
perhaps
an
angel
of
God
;
no
one
on
earth
knows
,
but
as
she
ran
along
the
quay
-
side
she
all
at
once
turned
up
an
entry
,
and
through
an
open
door
.
  
<EOS>
He
,
following
all
the
time
,
came
into
a
quiet
dark
parlour
,
with
a
cloth
and
tea
-
things
on
the
table
ready
for
breakfast
;
the
change
from
the
bright
sunny
air
out
of
doors
to
the
deep
shadow
of
this
room
made
him
think
for
the
first
moment
that
she
had
passed
on
,
and
that
no
one
was
there
,
and
he
stood
for
an
instant
baffled
,
and
hearing
no
sound
<EOS>
but
the
beating
of
his
own
heart
;
but
an
irrepressible
sobbing
gasp
made
him
look
round
,
and
there
he
saw
her
cowered
behind
the
door
<EOS>
,
her
face
covered
tight
up
,
and
sharp
shudders
going
through
her
whole
frame
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
love
,
my
darling
!
"
said
he
,
going
up
to
her
,
and
trying
to
raise
her
,
and
to
loosen
her
hands
away
from
her
face
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
been
too
sudden
for
thee
:
it
was
thoughtless
in
me
;
but
I
have
so
looked
forward
to
this
time
,
and
seeing
thee
come
along
the
field
,
and
go
past
me
,
but
I
should
ha
'
been
more
tender
and
careful
of
thee
.
<EOS>
Nay
!
<EOS>
let
me
have
another
look
of
thy
sweet
face
.
"
  
<EOS>
All
this
he
whispered
in
the
old
tones
of
manoeuvring
love
,
in
that
voice
she
had
yearned
and
hungered
to
hear
in
life
,
and
had
not
heard
,
for
all
her
longing
,
save
in
her
dreams
.
  
<EOS>
She
tried
to
crouch
more
and
more
into
the
corner
,
into
the
hidden
shadow
 
to
sink
into
the
ground
out
of
sight
.
  
<EOS>
Once
more
he
spoke
,
beseeching
her
to
lift
up
her
face
,
to
let
him
hear
her
speak
.
  
<EOS>
But
she
only
moaned
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sylvia
!
<EOS>
"
said
he
,
thinking
he
could
change
his
tactics
,
and
pique
her
into
speaking
,
that
he
would
make
a
pretence
of
suspicion
and
offence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sylvia
!
<EOS>
one
would
think
you
were
n't
glad
to
see
me
back
again
at
length
.
<EOS>
I
only
came
in
late
last
night
,
and
my
first
thought
on
wakening
was
of
you
;
it
has
been
ever
since
I
left
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
took
her
hands
away
from
her
face
;
it
was
gray
as
the
face
of
death
;
her
awful
eyes
were
passionless
in
her
despair
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
have
yo
'
been
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
,
in
slow
,
hoarse
tones
,
as
if
her
voice
were
half
strangled
within
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Been
!
"
said
he
,
a
red
light
coming
into
his
eyes
,
as
he
bent
his
looks
upon
her
;
now
,
indeed
,
a
true
and
not
an
assumed
suspicion
entering
his
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
Been
!
"
<EOS>
he
repeated
;
then
,
coming
a
step
nearer
to
her
,
and
taking
her
hand
,
not
tenderly
this
time
,
but
with
a
resolution
to
be
satisfied
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
not
your
cousin
 
Hepburn
<EOS>
,
I
mean
 
did
not
he
tell
you
?
 
<EOS>
he
saw
the
press
-
gang
seize
me
,
 
I
gave
him
a
message
to
you
 
<EOS>
I
bade
you
keep
true
to
me
as
I
would
be
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Between
every
clause
of
this
speech
he
paused
and
gasped
for
her
answer
;
but
none
came
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
dilated
and
held
his
steady
gaze
prisoner
as
with
a
magical
charm
 
neither
could
look
away
from
the
other
's
wild
,
searching
gaze
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
ended
,
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
,
then
she
cried
out
,
shrill
and
fierce
,
    
"
Philip
!
"
<EOS>
No
answer
.
  
<EOS>
Wilder
and
shriller
still
,
"
Philip
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
in
the
distant
ware
-
room
completing
the
last
night
's
work
before
the
regular
shop
hours
began
;
before
breakfast
,
also
,
that
his
wife
might
not
find
him
waiting
and
impatient
.
  
<EOS>
He
heard
her
cry
;
it
cut
through
doors
,
and
still
air
,
and
great
bales
of
woollen
stuff
;
he
thought
that
she
had
hurt
herself
,
that
her
mother
was
worse
,
that
her
baby
was
ill
,
and
he
hastened
to
the
spot
whence
the
cry
proceeded
.
  
<EOS>
On
opening
the
door
that
separated
the
shop
from
the
sitting
-
room
,
he
saw
the
back
of
a
naval
officer
,
and
his
wife
on
the
ground
,
huddled
up
in
a
heap
;
when
she
perceived
him
come
in
,
she
dragged
herself
up
by
means
of
a
chair
,
groping
like
a
blind
person
,
and
came
and
stood
facing
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
officer
turned
fiercely
round
,
and
would
have
come
towards
Philip
,
who
was
so
bewildered
by
the
scene
that
even
yet
he
did
not
understand
who
the
stranger
was
,
did
not
perceive
for
an
instant
that
he
saw
the
realization
of
his
greatest
dread
.
  
<EOS>
But
Sylvia
laid
her
hand
on
Kinraid
's
arm
,
and
assumed
to
herself
the
right
of
speech
.
<EOS>
Philip
did
not
know
her
voice
,
it
was
so
changed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Philip
,
"
she
said
,
"
this
is
Kinraid
come
back
again
to
we
d
me
.
<EOS>
He
is
alive
;
he
has
niver
been
dead
,
only
taken
by
t
'
press
-
gang
.
<EOS>
And
he
says
yo
'
saw
it
,
and
knew
it
all
t
'
time
.
<EOS>
Speak
,
was
it
so
?
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
knew
not
what
to
say
,
whither
to
turn
,
under
what
refuge
of
words
or
acts
to
shelter
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
's
influence
was
keeping
Kinraid
silent
,
but
he
was
rapidly
passing
beyond
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Speak
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
loosening
himself
from
Sylvia
's
light
grasp
,
and
coming
towards
Philip
,
with
a
threatening
gesture
.
<EOS>
"
Did
I
not
bid
you
tell
her
how
it
was
?
<EOS>
Did
I
not
bid
<EOS>
you
say
how
I
would
be
faithful
to
her
,
and
she
was
to
be
faithful
to
me
?
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
you
damned
scoundrel
!
<EOS>
have
you
kept
it
from
her
all
that
time
,
and
let
her
think
me
dead
,
or
false
?
<EOS>
Take
that
!
"
  
<EOS>
His
closed
fist
was
up
to
strike
the
man
,
who
hung
his
head
with
bitterest
shame
and
miserable
self
-
reproach
;
but
Sylvia
came
swift
between
the
blow
and
its
victim
.
  
<EOS>
"
Charley
,
thou
sha
n't
strike
him
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
damned
scoundrel
"
(
this
was
said
in
the
hardest
,
quietest
tone
)
"
but
he
is
my
husband
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
thou
false
heart
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Kinraid
,
turning
sharp
on
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
ever
I
trusted
woman
,
I
trusted
you
,
Sylvia
Robson
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
made
as
though
throwing
her
from
him
,
with
a
gesture
of
contempt
that
stung
her
to
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Charley
!
<EOS>
"
she
cried
,
springing
to
him
,
"
dunnot
cut
me
to
the
quick
;
have
pity
on
me
,
though
he
had
none
.
<EOS>
I
did
so
love
thee
;
it
was
my
very
heart
-
strings
as
gave
way
when
they
told
me
thou
was
drowned
 
feyther
,
and
th
'
Corneys
,
and
all
,
iverybody
.
<EOS>
Thy
hat
and
t
<EOS>
'
bit
o
'
ribbon
<EOS>
I
gave
thee
were
found
drenched
and
dripping
wi
'
sea
-
water
;
and
I
went
mourning
for
thee
all
the
day
long
 
<EOS>
dunnot
turn
away
from
me
;
only
hearken
this
once
,
and
then
kill
me
dead
,
and
I
'll
bless
yo
'
,
 
and
have
niver
been
mysel
'
since
<EOS>
;
niver
ceased
to
feel
t
'
sun
grow
dark
and
th
'
air
chill
and
dreary
when
I
thought
on
t
'
time
when
thou
was
alive
.
<EOS>
I
did
,
my
Charley
,
my
own
love
!
<EOS>
And
I
thought
thou
was
dead
for
iver
,
and
I
wished
I
were
lying
beside
thee
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Charley
!
<EOS>
Philip
,
theere
,
where
he
stands
,
could
tell
yo
'
this
was
true
.
<EOS>
Philip
,
was
n't
it
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Would
God
I
were
dead
!
"
<EOS>
moaned
forth
the
unhappy
,
guilty
man
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
turned
to
Kinraid
,
and
was
speaking
again
to
him
,
and
neither
of
them
heard
or
heeded
him
 
<EOS>
they
were
drawing
closer
and
closer
together
 
she
,
with
her
cheeks
and
eyes
aflame
,
talking
eagerly
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
feyther
was
taken
up
,
and
all
for
setting
some
free
as

gotten
by

<EOS>
Charley

<EOS>
good
kind
feyther
was
hung
on
a
gallows
;
and

lost
her

and
grew
silly
in
grief
,
and
we
were
like
to
be
turned
out
on
t
'
wide
world
,
and
poor
mother
dateless
 
<EOS>
and
I
thought
yo
'
were
dead
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
thought
yo
'
were
dead
<EOS>
,
I
did
 
<EOS>
oh
,
Charley
,
Charley
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
By
this
time
they
were
in
each
other
's
arms
,
she
with
her
head
on
his
shoulder
,
crying
as
if
her
heart
would
break
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
came
forwards
and
took
hold
of
her
to
pull
her
away
;
but
Charley
held
her
tight
,
mutely
defying
Philip
.
<EOS>
Unconsciously
she
was
Philip
's
protection
,
in
that
hour
of
danger
,
from
a
blow
which
might
have
been
his
death
if
strong
will
could
have
aided
it
to
kill
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sylvie
!
"
said
he
,
grasping
her
tight
.
<EOS>
"
Listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
did
n't
love
yo
'
as
I
did
.
<EOS>
He
had
loved
other
women
.
<EOS>
I
,
yo
'
 
yo
'
alone
.
<EOS>
He
loved
other
girls
before
yo
'
,
and
had
left
off
loving
'em
.
<EOS>
I
 
I
wish
God
would
free
my
heart
from
the
pang
;
but
it
will
go
on
till
I
die
,
whether
yo
'
love
me
or
not
.
<EOS>
And
then
 
where
was
I
?
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
that
very
night
that
he
was
taken
,
I
was
a
-
thinking
on
yo
'
and
on
him
;
and
I
might
ha
'
given
yo
'
his
message
,
but
I
heard
them
speaking
of
him
as
knew
him
well
;
talking
of
his
false
fickle
ways
.
<EOS>
How
was
I
to
know
he
would
keep
true
to
thee
?
<EOS>
It
might
be
a
sin
in
me
,
I
can
not
say
;
my
heart
and
my
sense
are
gone
dead
within
me
.
<EOS>
I
know
this
<EOS>
,
I
've
loved
yo
'
as
no
man
<EOS>
but
me
ever
loved
before
.
<EOS>
Have
some
pity
and
forgiveness
on
me
,
if
it
's
only
because
I
've
been
so
tormented
with
my
love
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
at
her
with
feverish
eager
wistfulness
;
it
faded
away
into
despair
as
she
made
no
sign
of
having
even
heard
his
words
.
<EOS>
He
let
go
his
hold
of
her
,
and
his
arm
fell
loosely
by
his
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
may
die
,
"
he
said
,
"
for
my
life
is
ended
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sylvia
!
"
spoke
out
Kinraid
,
bold
and
fervent
,
"
your
marriage
is
no
marriage
.
<EOS>
You
were
tricked
into
it
.
<EOS>
You
are
my
wife
,
not
his
.
<EOS>
I
am
your
husband
;
we
plighted
each
other
our
troth
.
<EOS>
See
!
<EOS>
here
is
my
half
of
the
sixpence
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
pulled
it
out
from
his
bosom
,
tied
by
a
black
ribbon
<EOS>
round
his
neck
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
they
stripped
me
and
searched
me
in
th
'
French
prison
,
I
managed
to
keep
this
.
<EOS>
No
lies
can
break
the
oath
we
swore
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
I
can
get
your
pretence
of
a
marriage
set
aside
.
<EOS>
I
'm
in
favour
with
my
admiral
,
and
he
'll
do
a
deal
for
me
,
and
back
me
out
.
<EOS>
Come
with
me
;
your
marriage
shall
be
set
aside
,
and
we
'll
be
married
again
,
all
square
and
above
-
board
.
<EOS>
Come
away
.
<EOS>
Leave
that
damned
fellow
to
repent
of
the
trick
he
played
an
honest
sailor
;
we
'll
be
true
,
whatever
has
come
and
gone
.
<EOS>
Come
,
Sylvia

"
  
<EOS>
His
arm
was
round
her
waist
,
and
he
was
drawing
her
towards
the
door
,
his
face
all
crimson
with
eagerness
and
hope
.
<EOS>
Just
then
the
baby
cried
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hark
!
"
said
she
,
starting
away
from
Kinraid
,
"
baby
's
crying
for
me
.
<EOS>
His
child
 
<EOS>
yes
,
it
is
his
child
 
<EOS>
I
'd
forgotten
that
 
forgotten
all
.
<EOS>
I
'll
make
my
vow
now
,
lest
I
lose
mysel

again
.
<EOS>
I
'll
never
forgive
yon
man
,
nor
live
with
him
as
his
wife
again
.
<EOS>
All
that
's
done
and
ended
.
<EOS>
He
's
spoilt
my
life
,
 
<EOS>
he
's
spoilt
it
for
as
long
as
iver
<EOS>
I
live
on
this
earth

but
neither
yo

nor

shall
spoil
my

<EOS>
It
goes
hard
wi

me
,
Charley

it
does
indeed

<EOS>
I
'll
just
give
yo
'
one
kiss
 
one
little
kiss
 
<EOS>
and
then
,
so
help
me
God

I

I

A
<EOS>
RECKLESS
RECRUIT
  
<EOS>
She
lay
across
a
chair
,
her
arms
helplessly
stretched
out
,
her
face
unseen
.
<EOS>
Every
now
and
then
a
thrill
ran
through
her
body
:
she
was
talking
to
herself
all
the
time
with
incessant
low
incontinence
of
words
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
stood
near
her
,
motionless
:
he
did
not
know
whether
she
was
conscious
of
his
presence
;
in
fact
,
he
knew
nothing
but
that
he
and
she
were
sundered
for
ever
;
he
could
only
take
in
that
one
idea
,
and
it
numbed
all
other
thought
.
  
<EOS>
Once
more
her
baby
cried
for
the
comfort
she
alone
could
give
.
  
<EOS>
She
rose
to
her
feet
,
but
staggered
when
she
tried
to
walk
;
her
glazed
eyes
fell
upon
Philip
as
he
instinctively
made
a
step
to
hold
her
steady
.
<EOS>
No
light
came
into
her
eyes
any
more
than
if
she
had
looked
upon
a
perfect
stranger
;
not
even
was
there
the
contraction
of
dislike
.
<EOS>
Some
other
figure
filled
her
mind
,
and
she
saw
him
no
more
than
she
saw
the
inanimate
table
.
<EOS>
That
way
of
looking
at
him
withered
him
up
more
than
any
sign
of
aversion
would
have
done
.
  
<EOS>
He
watched
her
laboriously
climb
the
stairs
,
and
vanish
out
of
sight
;
and
sat
down
with
a
sudden
feeling
of
extreme
bodily
weakness
.
  
<EOS>
The
door
of
communication
between
the
parlour
and
the
shop
was
opened
.
<EOS>
That
was
the
first
event
of
which
Philip
took
note
;
but
Phoebe
had
come
in
unawares
to
him
,
with
the
intention
of
removing
the
breakfast
things
on
her
return
from
market
,
and
seeing
them
unused
,
and
knowing
that
Sylvia
had
sate
up
all
night
with
her
mother
,
she
had
gone
back
to
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
Philip
had
neither
seen
nor
heard
her
.
  
<EOS>
Now
Coulson
came
in
,
amazed
at
Hepburn
's
non
-
appearance
in
the
shop
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
!
<EOS>
Philip
,
what
's
ado
?
<EOS>
How
ill
yo
'
look
,
man
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
he
,
thoroughly
alarmed
by
Philip
's
ghastly
appearance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
's
the
matter
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
!
"
said
Philip
,
slowly
gathering
his
thoughts
.
<EOS>
"
Why
should
there
be
anything
the
matter
?
"
  
<EOS>
His
instinct
,
quicker
to
act
than
his
reason
,
made
him
shrink
from
his
misery
being
noticed
,
much
more
made
any
subject
for
explanation
or
sympathy
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
may
be
nothing
the
matter
wi
'
thee
,
"
said
Coulson
,
"
but
thou
's
the
look
of
a
corpse
on
thy
face
.
<EOS>
I
was
afeared
something
was
wrong
,
for
it
's
half
-
past
nine
,
and
thee
so
punctual
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
almost
guarded
Philip
into
the
shop
,
and
kept
furtively
watching
him
,
and
perplexing
himself
with
Philip
's
odd
,
strange
ways
.
  
<EOS>
Hester
,
too
,
observed
the
heavy
broken
-
down
expression
on
Philip
's
ashen
face
,
and
her
heart
ached
for
him
;
but
after
that
first
glance
,
which
told
her
so
much
,
she
avoided
all
appearance
of
noticing
or
watching
.
<EOS>
Only
a
shadow
brooded
over
her
sweet
,
calm
face
,
and
once
or
twice
she
sighed
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
market
-
day
,
and
people
came
in
and
out
,
bringing
their
store
of
gossip
from
the
country
,
or
the
town
 
from
the
farm
or
the
quay
-
side
.
  
<EOS>
Among
the
pieces
of
news
,
the
rescue
of
the
smack
the
night
before
furnished
a
large
topic
;
and
by
-
and
-
by
<EOS>
Philip
heard
a
name
that
startled
him
into
attention
.
  
<EOS>
The
landlady
of
a
small
public
-
house
much
frequented
by
sailors
was
talking
to
Coulson
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
sailor
aboard
of
her
as
knowed
Kinraid
by
sight
,
in
Shields
,
years
ago
;
and
he
called
him
by
his
name
<EOS>
afore
<EOS>
they
were
well
out
o
'
t
'
river
.
<EOS>
And
Kinraid
was
no
ways
set
up
,
for
all
his
lieutenant
's
uniform
(
and
eh
!
<EOS>
but
they
say
he
looks
handsome
in
it
!
)
<EOS>
;
but
he
tells
'
m
all
about
it
 
how
he
was
pressed
aboard
a
man
-
o
'
 
war
,
an
'
for
his
good
conduct
were
made
a
warrant
officer
,
boatswain
,
or
something
!
"
  
<EOS>
All
the
people
in
the
shop
were
listening
now
;
Philip
alone
seemed
engrossed
in
folding
up
a
piece
of
cloth
,
so
as
to
leave
no
possible
chance
of
creases
in
it
;
yet
he
lost
not
a
syllable
of
the
good
woman
's
narration
.
  
<EOS>
She
,
pleased
with
the
enlarged
audience
her
tale
had
attracted
,
went
on
with
fresh
vigour
.
  
<EOS>
"
An
'
there
's
a
gallant
captain
,
one
Sir
Sidney
Smith
,
and
he
'd
<EOS>
a
notion
o
'
<EOS>
goin'
smack
into
a
French
port
,
an
'
carryin
'
off
a
vessel
from
right
under
their
very
noses
;
an
'
says
he
,
"
Which
of
yo
'
British
sailors
'll
go
along
with
me
to
death
or
glory
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
Kinraid
stands
up
like
a
man
,
an
'
"
I
'll
go
with
yo
'
,
captain
,
"
he
says
.
<EOS>
So
they
,
an
'
some
others
as
brave
,
went
off
,
an
'
did
their
work
,
an
'
choose
whativer
it
was
,
they
did
it
famously
;
but
they
got
caught
by
them
French
,
an
'
were
clapped
into
prison
<EOS>
i
'
France
for
iver
so
long
;
but
at
last
one
Philip
 
Philip
somethin'
(
he
were
a
Frenchman
,
I
know
)
 
helped
'em
to
escape
,
in
a
fishin
'
 
boat
.
<EOS>
But
they
were
welcomed
by
th
'
whole
British
squadron
as
was
i
'
t
'
Channel
for
t
'
piece
of
daring
they
'd
done
i
'
cuttin
'
out
t
'
ship
from
a
French
port
;
an
'
Captain
Sir
Sidney
Smith
was
made
an
admiral
,
an
'
him
as
we
used
t
'
call
Charley
Kinraid
,
the
specksioneer
,
is
made
a
lieutenant
,
an
'
a
commissioned
officer
i
'
t
'
King
's
service
;
and
is
come
to
great
glory
,
and
slep
in
my
house
this
very
blessed
night
as
is
just
past
!
"
  
<EOS>
A
murmur
of
applause
and
interest
and
rejoicing
buzzed
all
around
Philip
.
<EOS>
All
this
was
publicly
known
about
Kinraid
,
 
and
how
much
more
?
<EOS>
All
Monkshaven
might
hear
tomorrow
 
nay
,
to
-
day
 
of
Philip
's
treachery
to
the
hero
of
the
hour
;
how
he
had
concealed
his
fate
,
and
supplanted
him
in
his
love
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
shrank
from
the
burst
of
popular
indignation
which
he
knew
must
follow
.
<EOS>
Any
wrong
done
to
one
who
stands
on
the
pinnacle
of
the
people
's
favour
is
resented
by
each
individual
as
a
personal
injury
;
and
among
a
primitive
set
of
country
-
folk
,
who
recognize
the
wild
passion
in
love
,
as
it
exists
untamed
by
the
trammels
of
reason
and
self
-
restraint
,
any
story
of
baulked
affections
,
or
treachery
in
such
matters
,
spreads
like
wildfire
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
knew
this
quite
well
;
his
doom
of
disgrace
lay
plain
before
him
,
if
only
Kinraid
spoke
the
word
.
<EOS>
His
head
was
bent
down
while
he
thus
listened
and
reflected
.
<EOS>
He
half
resolved
on
doing
something
;
he
lifted
up
his
head
,
caught
the
reflection
of
his
face
in
the
little
strip
of
glass
on
the
opposite
side
,
in
which
the
women
might
look
at
themselves
in
their
contemplated
purchases
,
and
quite
resolved
.
  
<EOS>
The
sight
he
saw
in
the
mirror
was
his
own
long
,
sad
,
pale
face
,
made
plainer
and
grayer
by
the
heavy
pressure
of
the
morning
's
events
.
<EOS>
He
saw
his
stooping
figure
,
his
rounded
shoulders
,
with
something
like
a
feeling
of
disgust
at
his
personal
appearance
as
he
remembered
the
square
,
upright
build
of
Kinraid
;
his
fine
uniform
,
with
epaulette
and
sword
-
belt
;
his
handsome
brown
face
;
his
dark
eyes
,
splendid
with
the
fire
of
passion
and
indignation
;
his
white
teeth
,
gleaming
out
with
the
terrible
smile
of
scorn
.
  
<EOS>
The
comparison
drove
Philip
from
passive
hopelessness
to
active
despair
.
  
<EOS>
He
went
abruptly
from
the
crowded
shop
into
the
empty
parlour
,
and
on
into
the
kitchen
,
where
he
took
up
a
piece
of
bread
,
and
heedless
of
Phoebe
's
look
and
words
,
began
to
eat
it
before
he
even
left
the
place
;
for
he
needed
the
strength
that
food
would
give
;
he
needed
it
to
carry
him
out
of
the
sight
and
the
knowledge
of
all
who
might
hear
what
he
had
done
,
and
point
their
fingers
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
paused
a
moment
in
the
parlour
,
and
then
,
setting
his
teeth
tight
together
,
he
went
upstairs
.
  
<EOS>
First
of
all
he
went
into
the
bit
of
a
room
opening
out
of
theirs
,
in
which
his
baby
slept
.
<EOS>
He
dearly
loved
the
child
,
and
many
a
time
would
run
in
and
play
a
while
with
it
;
and
in
such
gambols
he
and
Sylvia
had
passed
their
happiest
moments
of
wedded
life
.
  
<EOS>
The
little
Bella
was
having
her
morning
slumber
;
Nancy
used
to
tell
long
afterwards
how
he
knelt
down
by
the
side
of
her
cot
,
and
was
so
strange
<EOS>
she
thought
he
must
have
prayed
,
for
all
it
was
nigh
upon
eleven
o'clock
,
and
folk
in
their
senses
only
said
their
prayers
when
they
got
up
,
and
when
they
went
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
Then
he
rose
,
and
stooped
over
,
and
gave
the
child
a
long
,
lingering
,
soft
,
fond
kiss
.
<EOS>
And
on
tip
-
toe
he
passed
away
into
the
room
where
his
aunt
lay
;
his
aunt
who
had
been
so
true
a
friend
to
him
!
<EOS>
He
was
thankful
to
know
that
in
her
present
state
she
was
safe
from
the
knowledge
of
what
was
past
,
safe
from
the
sound
of
the
shame
to
come
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
not
meant
to
see
Sylvia
again
;
he
dreaded
the
look
of
her
hatred
,
her
scorn
,
but
there
,
outside
her
mother
's
bed
,
she
lay
,
apparently
asleep
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Robson
,
too
,
was
sleeping
,
her
face
towards
the
wall
.
<EOS>
Philip
could
not
help
it
;
he
went
to
have
one
last
look
at
his
wife
.
<EOS>
She
was
turned
towards
her
mother
,
her
face
averted
from
him
;
he
could
see
the
tear
-
stains
,
the
swollen
eyelids
,
the
lips
yet
quivering
:
he
stooped
down
,
and
bent
to
kiss
the
little
hand
that
lay
listless
by
her
side
.
<EOS>
As
his
hot
breath
neared
that
hand
it
was
twitched
away
,
and
a
shiver
ran
through
the
whole
prostrate
body
.
<EOS>
And
then
he
knew
that
she
was
not
asleep
,
only
worn
out
by
her
misery
,
 
misery
that
he
had
caused
.
  
<EOS>
He
sighed
heavily
;
but
he
went
away
,
down
-
stairs
,
and
away
for
ever
.
<EOS>
Only
as
he
entered
the
parlour
his
eyes
caught
on
two
silhouettes
,
one
of
himself
,
one
of
Sylvia
,
done
in
the
first
month
of
their
marriage
,
by
some
wandering
artist
,
if
so
he
could
be
called
.
<EOS>
They
were
hanging
against
the
wall
in
little
oval
wooden
frames
;
black
profiles
,
with
the
lights
done
in
gold
;
about
as
poor
semblances
of
humanity
as
could
be
conceived
;
but
Philip
went
up
,
and
after
looking
for
a
minute
or
so
at
Sylvia
's
,
he
took
it
down
,
and
buttoned
his
waistcoat
over
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
only
thing
he
took
away
from
his
home
.
  
<EOS>
He
went
down
the
entry
on
to
the
quay
.
<EOS>
The
river
was
there
,
and
waters
,
they
say
,
have
a
luring
power
,
and
a
weird
promise
of
rest
in
their
perpetual
monotony
of
sound
.
<EOS>
But
many
people
were
there
,
if
such
a
temptation
presented
itself
to
Philip
's
mind
;
the
sight
of
his
fellow
-
townsmen
,
perhaps
of
his
acquaintances
,
drove
him
up
another
entry
 
<EOS>
the
town
is
burrowed
with
such
 
back
into
the
High
Street
,
<EOS>
which
he
straightway
crossed
into
a
well
-
known
court
,
out
of
which
rough
steps
led
to
the
summit
of
the
hill
,
and
on
to
the
fells
and
moors
beyond
.
  
<EOS>
He
plunged
and
panted
up
this
rough
ascent
.
<EOS>
From
the
top
he
could
look
down
on
the
whole
town
lying
below
,
severed
by
the
bright
shining
river
into
two
parts
.
<EOS>
To
the
right
lay
the
sea
,
shimmering
and
heaving
;
there
were
the
cluster
of
masts
rising
out
of
the
little
port
;
the
irregular
roofs
of
the
houses
;
which
of
them
,
thought
he
,
as
he
carried
his
eye
along
the
quay
-
side
to
the
market
-
place
,
which
of
them
was
his
?
<EOS>
and
he
singled
it
out
in
its
unfamiliar
aspect
,
and
saw
the
thin
blue
smoke
rising
from
the
kitchen
chimney
,
where
even
now
Phoebe
was
cooking
the
household
meal
that
he
never
more
must
share
.
  
<EOS>
Up
at
that
thought
and
away
,
he
knew
not
nor
cared
not
whither
.
<EOS>
He
went
through
the
ploughed
fields
where
the
corn
was
newly
springing
;
he
came
down
upon
the
vast
sunny
sea
,
and
turned
his
back
upon
it
with
loathing
;
he
made
his
way
inland
to
the
high
green
pastures
;
the
short
upland
turf
above
which
the
larks
hung
poised
"
at
heaven
's
gate
"
.
<EOS>
He
strode
along
,
so
straight
and
heedless
of
briar
and
bush
,
that
the
wild
black
cattle
ceased
from
grazing
,
and
looked
after
him
with
their
great
blank
puzzled
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
passed
all
enclosures
and
stone
fences
now
,
and
was
fairly
on
the
desolate
brown
moors
;
through
the
withered
last
year
's
ling
and
fern
,
through
the
prickly
gorse
,
he
tramped
,
crushing
down
the
tender
shoots
of
this
year
's
growth
,
and
heedless
of
the
startled
plover
's
cry
,
goaded
by
the
furies
.
<EOS>
His
only
relief
from
thought
,
from
the
remembrance
of
Sylvia
's
looks
and
words
,
was
in
violent
bodily
action
.
  
<EOS>
So
he
went
on
till
<EOS>
evening
shadows
and
ruddy
evening
lights
came
out
upon
the
wild
fells
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
crossed
roads
and
lanes
,
with
a
bitter
avoidance
of
men
's
tracks
;
but
now
the
strong
instinct
of
self
-
preservation
came
out
,
and
his
aching
limbs
,
his
weary
heart
,
giving
great
pants
and
beats
for
a
time
,
and
then
ceasing
altogether
till
a
mist
swam
and
quivered
before
his
aching
eyes
,
warned
him
that
he
must
find
some
shelter
and
food
,
or
lie
down
to
die
.
<EOS>
He
fell
down
now
,
often
;
stumbling
over
the
slightest
obstacle
.
<EOS>
He
had
passed
the
cattle
pastures
;
he
was
among
the
black
-
faced
sheep
;
and
they
,
too
,
ceased
nibbling
,
and
looked
after
him
,
and
somehow
,
in
his
poor
wandering
imagination
,
their
silly
faces
turned
to
likenesses
of
Monkshaven
people
 
people
who
ought
to
be
far
,
far
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thou'll
be
belated
on
these
fells
,
if
thou
does
n't
tak
'
heed
,
"
shouted
some
one
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
looked
abroad
to
see
whence
the
voice
proceeded
.
  
<EOS>
An
old
stiff
-
legged
shepherd
,
in
a
smock
-
frock
,
was
within
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
.
<EOS>
Philip
did
not
answer
,
but
staggered
and
stumbled
towards
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
lork
!
"
said
the
man
,
"
wheere
hast
ta
been
?
<EOS>
Thou
's
seen
<EOS>
Oud
Harry
,
I
think
,
thou
looks
so
scared
.
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
rallied
himself
,
and
tried
to
speak
up
to
the
old
standard
of
respectability
;
but
the
effort
was
pitiful
to
see
,
had
any
one
been
by
,
who
could
have
understood
the
pain
it
caused
to
restrain
cries
of
bodily
and
mental
agony
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
lost
my
way
,
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
'
Twould
ha
'
been
enough
,
too
,
I
'm
thinkin
'
,
if
I
had
n't
come
out
after
t
'
ewes
.
<EOS>
There
's
t
'
Three
Griffins
near
at
hand
:
a
sup
o
'
Hollands
'll
set
thee
to
reeghts
.
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
followed
faintly
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
see
before
him
,
and
was
guided
by
the
sound
of
footsteps
rather
than
by
the
sight
of
the
figure
moving
onwards
.
<EOS>
He
kept
stumbling
;
and
he
knew
that
the
old
shepherd
swore
at
him
;
but
he
also
knew
such
curses
proceeded
from
no
ill
-
will
,
only
from
annoyance
at
the
delay
in
going
and
"
seem
"
after
t
'
ewes
.
"
<EOS>
But
had
the
man
's
words
conveyed
the
utmost
expression
of
hatred
,
Philip
would
neither
have
wondered
at
them
,
nor
resented
them
.
  
<EOS>
They
came
into
a
wild
mountain
road
,
unfenced
from
the
fells
.
<EOS>
A
hundred
yards
off
,
and
there
was
a
small
public
-
house
,
with
a
broad
ruddy
oblong
of
firelight
shining
across
the
tract
.
  
<EOS>
"
Theere
!
"
said
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
Thee
can
not
well
miss
that
.
<EOS>
A
dunno
tho
'
,
thee
bees
sich
a
gawby
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
he
went
on
,
and
delivered
Philip
safely
up
to
the
landlord
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
's
a
felly
as
a
fund
on
t
'
fell
side
,
just
as
one
as
if
he
were
drunk
;
but
he
's
sober
enough
,
a
reckon
,
only
summat
's
wrong
<EOS>
i
'
his
head
,
a'm
thinkin
'
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
said
Philip
,
sitting
down
on
the
first
chair
he
came
to
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
right
enough
;
just
fairly
wearied
out
:
lost
my
way
,
"
and
he
fainted
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
recruiting
sergeant
of
marines
sitting
in
the
house
-
place
,
drinking
.
<EOS>
He
,
too
,
like
Philip
,
had
lost
his
way
;
but
was
turning
his
blunder
to
account
by
telling
all
manner
of
wonderful
stories
to
two
or
three
rustics
who
had
come
in
ready
to
drink
on
any
pretence
;
especially
if
they
could
get
good
liquor
without
paying
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
sergeant
rose
as
Philip
fell
back
,
and
brought
up
his
own
mug
of
beer
,
into
which
a
noggin
of
gin
had
been
put
(
called
in
Yorkshire
"
dog's
-
nose
"
)
.
<EOS>
He
partly
poured
and
partly
spilt
some
of
this
beverage
on
Philip
's
face
;
some
drops
went
through
the
pale
and
parted
lips
,
and
with
a
start
the
worn
-
out
man
revived
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bring
him
some
victual
,
landlord
,
"
called
out
the
recruiting
sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
stand
shot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
brought
some
cold
bacon
and
coarse
oat
-
cake
.
<EOS>
The
sergeant
asked
for
pepper
and
salt
;
minced
the
food
fine
and
made
it
savoury
,
and
kept
administering
it
by
teaspoonfuls
;
urging
Philip
to
drink
from
time
to
time
from
his
own
cup
of
dog's
-
nose
.
  
<EOS>
A
burning
thirst
,
which
needed
no
stimulant
from
either
pepper
or
salt
,
took
possession
of
Philip
,
and
he
drank
freely
,
scarcely
recognizing
what
he
drank
.
<EOS>
It
took
effect
on
one
so
habitually
sober
;
and
he
was
soon
in
that
state
when
the
imagination
works
wildly
and
freely
.
  
<EOS>
He
saw
the
sergeant
before
him
,
handsome
,
and
bright
,
and
active
,
in
his
gay
red
uniform
,
without
a
care
,
as
it
seemed
to
Philip
,
taking
life
lightly
;
admired
and
respected
everywhere
because
of
his
cloth
.
  
<EOS>
If
Philip
were
gay
,
and
brisk
,
well
-
dressed
like
him
,
returning
with
martial
glory
to
Monkshaven
,
would
not
Sylvia
love
him
once
more
?
<EOS>
Could
not
he
win
her
heart
?
<EOS>
He
was
brave
by
nature
,
and
the
prospect
of
danger
did
not
daunt
him
,
if
ever
it
presented
itself
to
his
imagination
.
  
<EOS>
He
thought
he
was
cautious
in
entering
on
the
subject
of
enlistment
with
his
new
friend
,
the
sergeant
;
but
the
latter
was
twenty
times
as
cunning
as
he
,
and
knew
by
experience
how
to
bait
his
hook
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
was
older
by
some
years
than
the
regulation
age
;
but
,
at
that
time
of
great
demand
for
men
,
the
question
of
age
was
lightly
entertained
.
<EOS>
The
sergeant
was
profuse
in
statements
of
the
advantages
presented
to
a
man
of
education
in
his
branch
of
the
service
;
how
such
a
one
was
sure
to
rise
;
in
fact
,
it
would
have
seemed
from
the
sergeant
's
account
,
as
though
the
difficulty
consisted
in
remaining
in
the
ranks
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
's
dizzy
head
thought
the
subject
over
and
over
again
,
each
time
with
failing
power
of
reason
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
,
almost
,
as
it
would
seem
,
by
some
sleight
of
hand
,
he
found
the
fatal
shilling
in
his
palm
,
and
had
promised
to
go
before
the
nearest
magistrate
to
be
sworn
in
as
one
of
his
Majesty
's
marines
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
And
after
that
he
remembered
nothing
more
.
  
<EOS>
He
wakened
up
in
a
little
truckle
-
bed
in
the
same
room
as
the
sergeant
,
who
lay
sleeping
the
sleep
of
full
contentment
;
while
gradually
,
drop
by
drop
,
the
bitter
recollections
of
the
day
before
came
,
filling
up
Philip
's
cup
of
agony
.
  
<EOS>
He
knew
that
he
had
received
the
bounty
-
money
;
and
though
he
was
aware
that
he
had
been
partly
tricked
into
it
,
and
had
no
hope
,
no
care
,
indeed
,
for
any
of
the
advantages
so
liberally
promised
him
the
night
before
,
yet
he
was
resigned
,
with
utterly
despondent
passiveness
,
to
the
fate
to
which
he
had
pledged
himself
.
<EOS>
Anything
was
welcome
that
severed
him
from
his
former
life
,
that
could
make
him
forget
it
,
if
that
were
possible
;
and
also
welcome
anything
which
increased
the
chances
of
death
without
the
sinfulness
of
his
own
participation
in
the
act
.
<EOS>
He
found
in
the
dark
recess
of
his
mind
the
dead
body
of
his
fancy
of
the
previous
night
;
that
he
might
come
home
,
handsome
and
glorious
,
to
win
the
love
that
had
never
been
his
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
only
sighed
over
it
,
and
put
it
aside
out
of
his
sight
 
so
full
of
despair
<EOS>
was
he
.
<EOS>
He
could
eat
no
breakfast
,
though
the
sergeant
ordered
of
the
best
.
<EOS>
The
latter
kept
watching
his
new
recruit
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
,
expecting
a
remonstrance
,
or
dreading
a
sudden
bolt
.
  
<EOS>
But
Philip
walked
with
him
the
two
or
three
miles
in
the
most
submissive
silence
,
never
uttering
a
syllable
of
regret
or
repentance
;
and
before
Justice
Cholmley
,
of
Holm
-
Fell
Hall
,
he
was
sworn
into
his
Majesty
's
service
,
under
the
name
of
Stephen
Freeman
.
<EOS>
With
a
new
name
,
he
began
a
new
life
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
the
old
life
lives
for
ever
!
    
<EOS>
THINGS
<EOS>
UNUTTERABLE
  
<EOS>
After
Philip
had
passed
out
of
the
room
,
Sylvia
lay
perfectly
still
,
from
very
exhaustion
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
slept
on
,
happily
unconscious
of
all
the
turmoil
that
had
taken
place
;
yes
,
happily
,
though
the
heavy
sleep
was
to
end
in
death
.
<EOS>
But
of
this
her
daughter
knew
nothing
,
imagining
that
it
was
refreshing
slumber
,
instead
of
an
ebbing
of
life
.
<EOS>
Both
mother
and
daughter
lay
motionless
till
Phoebe
entered
the
room
to
tell
Sylvia
that
dinner
was
on
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
Then
Sylvia
sate
up
,
and
put
back
her
hair
,
bewildered
and
uncertain
as
to
what
was
to
be
done
next
;
how
she
should
meet
the
husband
to
whom
she
had
discarded
all
allegiance
,
repudiated
the
solemn
promise
of
love
and
obedience
which
she
had
vowed
.
  
<EOS>
Phoebe
came
into
the
room
,
with
natural
interest
in
the
invalid
,
scarcely
older
than
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
is
t
'
old
lady
?
"
<EOS>
asked
she
,
in
a
low
voice
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
turned
her
head
round
to
look
;
her
mother
had
never
moved
,
but
was
breathing
in
a
loud
uncomfortable
manner
,
that
made
her
stoop
over
her
to
see
the
averted
face
more
nearly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Phoebe
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
"
come
here
!
<EOS>
She
looks
strange
and
odd
;
her
eyes
are
open
,
but
do
n't
see
me
.
<EOS>
Phoebe
!
<EOS>
Phoebe
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sure
enough
,
she
's
in
a
bad
way
!
"
said
Phoebe
,
climbing
stiffly
on
to
the
bed
to
have
a
nearer
view
.
<EOS>
"
Hold
her
head
a
little
up
t
'
ease
her
breathin
'
while
I
go
for
master
;
he
'll
be
for
sendin
'
for
t
'
doctor
,
I
'll
be
bound
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
took
her
mother
's
head
and
laid
it
fondly
on
her
breast
,
speaking
to
her
and
trying
to
rouse
her
;
but
it
was
of
no
avail
:
the
hard
,
stertorous
breathing
grew
worse
and
worse
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
cried
out
for
help
;
Nancy
came
,
the
baby
in
her
arms
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
in
several
times
before
that
morning
;
and
the
child
came
smiling
and
crowing
at
its
mother
,
who
was
supporting
her
own
dying
parent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Nancy
!
<EOS>
"
said
Sylvia
;
"
what
is
the
matter
with
mother
?
<EOS>
yo
'
can
see
her
face
;
tell
me
quick
!
"
  
<EOS>
Nancy
set
the
baby
on
the
bed
for
all
reply
,
and
ran
out
of
the
room
,
crying
out
,
  
"
Master
!
<EOS>
master
!
<EOS>
Come
quick
!
<EOS>
T
'
old
missus
is
a
-
dying
!
"
  
<EOS>
This
appeared
to
be
no
news
to
Sylvia
,
and
yet
the
words
came
on
her
with
a
great
shock
,
but
for
all
that
she
could
not
cry
;
she
was
surprised
herself
at
her
own
deadness
of
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
Her
baby
crawled
to
her
,
and
she
had
to
hold
and
guard
both
her
mother
and
her
child
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
a
long
,
long
time
before
any
one
came
,
and
then
she
heard
muffled
voices
,
and
a
heavy
tramp
<EOS>
:
it
was
Phoebe
leading
the
doctor
upstairs
,
and
Nancy
creeping
in
behind
to
hear
his
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
He
did
not
ask
many
questions
,
and
Phoebe
replied
more
frequently
to
his
inquiries
than
did
Sylvia
,
who
looked
into
his
face
with
a
blank
,
tearless
,
speechless
despair
,
that
gave
him
more
pain
than
the
sight
of
her
dying
mother
.
  
<EOS>
The
long
decay
of
Mrs.
Robson
's
faculties
and
health
,
of
which
he
was
well
aware
,
had
in
a
certain
manner
prepared
him
for
some
such
sudden
termination
of
the
life
whose
duration
was
hardly
desirable
,
although
he
gave
several
directions
as
to
her
treatment
;
but
the
white
,
pinched
face
,
the
great
dilated
eye
,
the
slow
comprehension
of
the
younger
woman
,
struck
him
with
alarm
;
and
he
went
on
asking
for
various
particulars
,
more
with
a
view
of
rousing
Sylvia
,
if
even
it
were
to
tears
,
than
for
any
other
purpose
that
the
information
thus
obtained
could
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
best
have
pillows
propped
up
behind
her
 
<EOS>
it
will
not
be
for
long
;
she
does
not
know
that
you
are
holding
her
,
and
it
is
only
tiring
you
to
no
purpose
!
"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
's
terrible
stare
continued
:
he
put
his
advice
into
action
,
and
gently
tried
to
loosen
her
clasp
,
and
tender
hold
.
<EOS>
This
she
resisted
;
laying
her
cheek
against
her
poor
mother
's
unconscious
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
Hepburn
?
"
said
he
.
"
<EOS>
He
ought
to
be
here
!
"
  
<EOS>
Phoebe
looked
at
Nancy
,
Nancy
at
Phoebe
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
latter
who
replied
,
  
"
<EOS>
He
's
neither
i
'
t
'
house
nor
i
'
t
'
shop
.
<EOS>
A
seed
him
go
past
t
'
kitchen
window
better
nor
an
hour
ago
;
but
neither
William
Coulson
or
Hester
Rose
knows
where
he
's
gone
to
.
  
<EOS>
Dr
Morgan
's
lips
were
puckered
up
into
a
whistle
,
but
he
made
no
sound
.
  
<EOS>
"
Give
me
baby
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
suddenly
.
<EOS>
Nancy
had
taken
her
up
off
the
bed
where
she
had
been
sitting
,
encircled
by
her
mother
's
arm
.
<EOS>
The
nursemaid
gave
her
to
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
He
watched
the
mother
's
eye
,
it
followed
her
child
,
and
he
was
rejoiced
.
<EOS>
He
gave
a
little
pinch
to
the
baby
's
soft
flesh
,
and
she
cried
out
piteously
;
again
the
same
action
,
the
same
result
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
laid
her
mother
down
,
and
stretched
out
her
arms
for
her
child
,
hushing
it
,
and
moaning
over
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
far
so
good
!
"
said
Dr
Morgan
to
himself
.
<EOS>
"
But
where
is
the
husband
?
<EOS>
He
ought
to
be
here
.
"
<EOS>
He
went
down
-
stairs
to
make
inquiry
for
Philip
;
that
poor
young
creature
,
about
whose
health
he
had
never
felt
thoroughly
satisfied
since
the
fever
after
her
confinement
,
was
in
an
anxious
condition
,
and
with
an
inevitable
shock
awaiting
her
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
ought
to
be
with
her
,
and
supporting
her
to
bear
it
.
  
<EOS>
Dr
Morgan
went
into
the
shop
.
<EOS>
Hester
alone
was
there
.
<EOS>
Coulson
had
gone
to
his
comfortable
dinner
at
his
well
-
ordered
house
,
with
his
common
-
place
wife
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
felt
anxious
about
Philip
's
looks
and
strange
disappearance
,
he
had
also
managed
to
account
for
them
in
some
indifferent
way
.
  
<EOS>
Hester
was
alone
with
the
shop
-
boy
;
few
people
came
in
during
the
universal
Monkshaven
dinner
-
hour
.
<EOS>
She
was
resting
her
head
on
her
hand
,
and
puzzled
and
distressed
about
many
things
 
<EOS>
all
that
was
implied
by
the
proceedings
of
the
evening
before
between
Philip
and
Sylvia
;
and
that
was
confirmed
by
Philip
's
miserable
looks
and
strange
abstracted
ways
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
how
easy
Hester
would
have
found
it
to
make
him
happy
!
<EOS>
not
merely
how
easy
,
but
what
happiness
it
would
have
been
to
her
to
merge
her
every
wish
into
the
one
great
object
of
fulfiling
his
will
.
<EOS>
To
her
,
an
on
-
looker
,
the
course
of
married
life
,
which
should
lead
to
perfect
happiness
,
seemed
to
plain
!
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
it
is
often
so
!
<EOS>
and
the
resisting
forces
which
make
all
such
harmony
and
delight
impossible
are
not
recognized
by
the
bystanders
,
hardly
by
the
actors
.
<EOS>
But
if
these
resisting
forces
are
only
superficial
,
or
constitutional
,
they
are
but
the
necessary
discipline
here
,
and
do
not
radically
affect
the
love
which
will
make
all
things
right
in
heaven
.
  
<EOS>
Some
glimmering
of
this
latter
comforting
truth
shed
its
light
on
Hester
's
troubled
thoughts
from
time
to
time
.
<EOS>
But
again
,
how
easy
would
it
have
been
to
her
to
tread
the
maze
that
led
to
Philip
's
happiness
;
and
how
difficult
it
seemed
to
the
wife
he
had
chosen
!
  
<EOS>
She
was
aroused
by
Dr
Morgan
's
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
both
Coulson
and
Hepburn
have
left
the
shop
to
your
care
,
Hester
.
<EOS>
I
want
Hepburn
,
though
;
his
wife
is
in
a
very
anxious
state
.
<EOS>
Where
is
he
?
<EOS>
can
you
tell
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sylvia
in
an
anxious
state
!
<EOS>
I
've
not
seen
her
to
-
day
,
but
last
night
she
looked
as
well
as
could
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
;
<EOS>
but
many
a
thing
happens
in
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
is
dying
,
may
be
dead
by
this
time
;
and
her
husband
should
be
there
with
her
.
<EOS>
Ca
n't
you
send
for
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
where
he
is
,
"
said
Hester
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
went
off
from
here
all
on
a
sudden
,
when
there
was
all
the
market
-
folks
in
t
'
shop
;
I
thought
he
'd
maybe
gone
to
John
Foster
's
about
th
'
money
,
for
they
was
paying
a
deal
in
.
<EOS>
I
'll
send
there
and
inquire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
the
messenger
brought
back
word
that
he
had
not
been
seen
at
their
bank
all
morning
.
<EOS>
Further
inquiries
were
made
by
the
anxious
Hester
,
by
the
doctor
,
by
Coulson
;
all
they
could
learn
was
that
Phoebe
had
seen
him
pass
the
kitchen
window
about
eleven
o'clock
,
when
she
was
peeling
the
potatoes
for
dinner
;
and
<EOS>
two
lads
playing
on
the
quay
-
side
thought
they
had
seen
him
among
a
group
of
sailors
;
but
these
latter
,
as
far
as
they
could
be
identified
,
had
no
knowledge
of
his
appearance
among
them
.
  
<EOS>
Before
night
the
whole
town
was
excited
about
his
disappearance
.
<EOS>
Before
night
Bell
Robson
had
gone
to
her
long
home
.
<EOS>
And
Sylvia
still
lay
quiet
and
tearless
,
apparently
more
unmoved
than
any
other
creature
by
the
events
of
the
day
,
and
the
strange
vanishing
of
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
The
only
thing
she
seemed
to
care
for
was
her
baby
;
she
held
it
tight
in
her
arms
,
and
Dr
Morgan
bade
them
leave
it
there
<EOS>
,
its
touch
might
draw
the
desired
tears
into
her
weary
,
sleepless
eyes
,
and
charm
the
aching
pain
out
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
afraid
lest
she
should
inquire
for
her
husband
,
whose
non
-
appearance
at
such
a
time
of
sorrow
to
his
wife
<EOS>
must
(
they
thought
)
seem
strange
to
her
.
<EOS>
And
night
drew
on
while
they
were
all
in
this
state
.
<EOS>
She
had
gone
back
to
her
own
room
without
a
word
when
they
had
desired
her
to
do
so
;
caressing
her
child
in
her
arms
,
and
sitting
down
on
the
first
chair
she
came
to
,
with
a
heavy
sigh
,
as
if
even
this
slight
bodily
exertion
had
been
too
much
for
her
.
<EOS>
They
saw
her
eyes
turn
towards
the
door
every
time
it
was
opened
,
and
they
thought
it
was
with
anxious
expectation
of
one
who
could
not
be
found
,
though
many
were
seeking
for
him
in
all
probable
places
.
  
<EOS>
When
night
came
some
one
had
to
tell
her
of
her
husband
's
disappearance
;
and
Dr
Morgan
was
the
person
who
undertook
this
.
  
<EOS>
He
came
into
her
room
about
nine
o'clock
;
her
baby
was
sleeping
in
her
arms
;
she
herself
pale
as
death
,
still
silent
and
tearless
,
though
strangely
watchful
of
gestures
and
sounds
,
and
probably
cognizant
of
more
than
they
imagined
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mrs.
Hepburn
,
"
said
he
,
as
cheerfully
as
he
could
,
"
I
should
advise
your
going
to
bed
early
;
for
I
fancy
<EOS>
your
husband
wo
n't
come
home
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
Some
journey
or
other
,
that
perhaps
Coulson
can
explain
better
than
I
can
,
will
most
likely
keep
him
away
till
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
It
's
very
unfortunate
that
he
should
be
away
at
such
a
sad
time
as
this
,
as
I
'm
sure
he
'll
feel
when
he
returns
;
but
we
must
make
the
best
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
watched
her
to
see
the
effect
of
his
words
.
  
<EOS>
She
sighed
,
that
was
all
.
<EOS>
He
still
remained
a
little
while
.
<EOS>
She
lifted
her
head
up
a
little
and
asked
,
  
"
How
long
do
yo
'
think
she
was
unconscious
,
doctor
?
<EOS>
Could
she
hear
things
,
think
yo
'
,
<EOS>
afore
she
fell
into
that
strange
kind
o
'
slumber
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
,
"
said
he
,
shaking
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
Was
she
breathing
in
that
hard
snoring
kind
of
way
when
you
left
her
this
morning
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
think
so
;
I
can
not
tell
,
so
much
has
happened
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
you
came
back
to
her
,
after
your
breakfast
,
I
think
you
said
she
was
in
much
the
same
position
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
yet
I
may
be
telling
yo
'
lies
;
if
I
could
but
think
:
<EOS>
but
it
's
my
head
as
is
aching
so
;
doctor
,
I
wish
yo'd
go
,
for
I
need
being
alone
,
I
'm
so
mazed
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Good
-
night
,
then
,
for
you
're
a
wise
woman
,
I
see
,
and
mean
to
go
to
bed
,
and
have
a
good
night
with
baby
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
he
went
down
to
Phoebe
,
and
told
her
to
go
in
from
time
to
time
,
and
see
how
her
mistress
was
.
  
<EOS>
He
found
Hester
Rose
and
the
old
servant
together
;
both
had
been
crying
,
both
were
evidently
in
great
trouble
about
the
death
and
the
mystery
of
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
Hester
asked
if
she
might
go
up
and
see
Sylvia
,
and
the
doctor
gave
his
leave
,
talking
meanwhile
with
Phoebe
over
the
kitchen
fire
.
<EOS>
Hester
came
down
again
without
seeing
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
The
door
of
the
room
was
bolted
,
and
everything
quiet
inside
.
  
<EOS>
"
Does
she
know
where
her
husband
is
,
think
you
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
doctor
at
this
account
of
Hester
's
.
<EOS>
"
She
's
not
anxious
about
him
at
any
rate
:
or
else
the
shock
of
her
mother
's
death
has
been
too
much
for
her
.
<EOS>
We
must
hope
for
some
change
in
the
morning
;
a
good
fit
of
crying
,
or
a
fidget
about
her
husband
,
would
be
more
natural
.
<EOS>
Good
-
night
to
you
both
,
"
and
off
he
went
.
  
<EOS>
Phoebe
and
Hester
avoided
looking
at
each
other
at
these
words
.
<EOS>
Both
were
conscious
of
the
probability
of
something
having
gone
seriously
wrong
between
the
husband
and
wife
.
<EOS>
Hester
had
the
recollection
of
the
previous
night
,
Phoebe
the
untasted
breakfast
of
to
-
day
to
go
upon
.
  
<EOS>
She
spoke
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
just
wish
he
'd
come
home
to
still
folks
'
tongues
.
<EOS>
It
need
niver
ha
'
been
known
if
t
'
old
lady
had
n't
died
this
day
of
all
others
.
<EOS>
It
's
such
a
thing
for
t
'
shop
t
'

<EOS>
one
o
'
t
'
partners
missin

,
<EOS>
an
'
no
one
for

what
's
comed
on
him
.
<EOS>
It
niver
happened
<EOS>
i
'
Fosters
'
days
,
that
's
a
'
I
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
'll
maybe
come
back
yet
,
"
said
Hester
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
so
very
late
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
were
market
day
,
and
a
'
,
"
continued
Phoebe
,
"
just
as
if
iverything
mun
go
wrong
together
;
an
'
a
'
t
'
country
<EOS>
customers'll
go
back
wi
'
fine
tale
<EOS>
i
'
their
mouths
,
as
Measter
Hepburn
was
strayed
an
'
missin
'
just
like
a
beast
o
'
some
kind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hark
!
<EOS>
is
n't
that
a
step
?
"
said
Hester
suddenly
,
as
a
footfall
sounded
in
the
now
quiet
street
;
but
it
passed
the
door
,
and
the
hope
that
had
arisen
on
its
approach
fell
as
the
sound
died
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
'll
noane
come
to
-
night
,
"
said
Phoebe
,
who
had
been
as
eager
a
listener
as
Hester
,
however
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Thou'd
best
go
thy
ways
home
;
a
shall
stay
up
,
for
it
's
not
seemly
for
us
<EOS>
a
'
t
'
go
to
our
beds
,
an
'
a
corpse
in
t
'
house
;
an
'
Nancy
,
as
might
ha
'
watched
,
is
gone
to
her
bed
this
hour
past
,
like
a
lazy
boots
as
she
is
.
<EOS>
A
can
hear
,
too
,
if
t
'
measter
does
come
home
;
tho
'
a'll
be
bound
<EOS>
he
wunnot
<EOS>
;
choose
wheere
he
is
,
he
'll
be
i
'
bed
by
now
,
for
it
's
well
on
to
eleven
.
<EOS>
I
'll
let
thee
out
by
t
'
shop
-
door
,
and
stand
by
it
till
thou
's
close
at
home
,
for
it
's
ill
for
a
young
woman
to
be
i
'
t
'
street
so
late
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
she
held
the
door
open
,
and
shaded
the
candle
from
the
flickering
outer
air
,
while
Hester
went
to
her
home
with
a
heavy
heart
.
  
<EOS>
Heavily
and
hopelessly
did
they
all
meet
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
No
news
of
Philip
,
no
change
in
Sylvia
;
an
unceasing
flow
of
angling
and
conjecture
and
gossip
radiating
from
the
shop
into
the
town
.
  
<EOS>
Hester
could
have
entreated
Coulson
on
her
knees
to
cease
from
repeating
the
details
of
a
story
of
which
every
word
touched
on
a
raw
place
in
her
sensitive
heart
;
moreover
,
when
they
talked
together
so
eagerly
,
she
could
not
hear
the
coming
footsteps
on
the
pavement
without
.
  
<EOS>
Once
some
one
hit
very
near
the
truth
in
a
chance
remark
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
seems
strange
,
"
she
said
,
"
how
as
one
man
turns
up
,
another
just
disappears
.
<EOS>
Why
,
it
were
but
upo
'
Tuesday
as
Kinraid
come
back
,
as
all
his
own
folk
had
thought
to
be
dead
;
and
next
day
here
's
Measter
Hepburn
as
is
gone
<EOS>
no
one
knows
wheere
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
t
'
way
<EOS>
i
'
this
world
,
"
replied
Coulson
,
a
little
sententiously
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
life
is
full
o
'
changes
o
'
one
kind
or
another
;
them
that
's
dead
is
alive
;
and
as
for
poor
Philip
,
though
he
was
alive
,
he
looked
fitter
to
be
dead
when
he
came
into
t
'
shop
o
'
Wednesday
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
does
she
take
it
?
"
<EOS>
nodding
to
where
Sylvia
was
supposed
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
she
's
not
herself
,
so
to
say
.
<EOS>
She
were
just
stunned
by
finding
her
mother
was
dying
in
her
very
arms
when
she
thought
as
she
were
only
sleeping
;
yet
she
's
never
been
able
to
cry
a
drop
;
so
that
t
'
sorrow
's
gone
inwards
on
her
brain
,
and
from
all
I
can
hear
,
she
does
n't
rightly
understand
as
her
husband
is
missing
.
<EOS>
T
'
doctor
says
if
she
could
but
cry
,
she
'd
come
to
a
juster
comprehension
of
things
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
do
John
and
Jeremiah
Foster
say
to
it
all
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
're
down
here
many
a
time
in
t
'
day
to
ask
if
he
's
come
back
,
or
how
she
is
;
for
they
made
a
deal
on
'em
both
.
<EOS>
They
're
going
t
'
attend
t
'
funeral
to
-
morrow
,
and
have
given
orders
as
t
'
shop
is
to
be
shut
up
in
t
'
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
To
the
surprise
of
every
one
,
Sylvia
,
who
had
never
left
her
room
since
the
night
of
her
mother
's
death
,
and
was
supposed
to
be
almost
unconscious
of
all
that
was
going
on
in
the
house
,
declared
her
intention
of
following
her
mother
to
the
grave
.
<EOS>
No
one
could
do
more
than
remonstrate
:
no
one
had
sufficient
authority
to
interfere
with
her
.
<EOS>
Dr
Morgan
even
thought
that
she
might
possibly
be
roused
to
tears
by
the
occasion
;
only
he
begged
Hester
to
go
with
her
,
that
she
might
have
the
solace
of
some
woman
's
company
.
  
<EOS>
She
went
through
the
greater
part
of
the
ceremony
in
the
same
hard
,
unmoved
manner
in
which
she
had
received
everything
for
days
past
.
  
<EOS>
But
on
looking
up
once
,
as
they
formed
round
the
open
grave
<EOS>
,
she
saw
Kester
,
in
his
Sunday
clothes
,
with
a
bit
of
new
crape
round
his
hat
,
crying
as
if
his
heart
would
break
over
the
coffin
of
his
good
,
kind
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
His
evident
distress
,
the
unexpected
sight
,
suddenly
loosed
the
fountain
of
Sylvia
's
tears
,
and
her
sobs
grew
so
terrible
that
Hester
feared
she
would
not
be
able
to
remain
until
the
end
of
the
funeral
.
<EOS>
But
she
struggled
hard
to
stay
till
the
last
,
and
then
she
made
an
effort
to
go
round
by
the
place
where
Kester
stood
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
and
see
me
,
"
was
all
she
could
say
for
crying
:
and
Kester
only
nodded
his
head
 
<EOS>
he
could
not
speak
a
word
.
    
<EOS>
MYSTERIOUS
TIDINGS
  
<EOS>
That
very
evening
Kester
came
,
humbly
knocking
at
the
kitchen
-
door
.
<EOS>
Phoebe
opened
it
.
<EOS>
He
asked
to
see
Sylvia
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
know
not
if
she
'll
see
thee
,
"
said
Phoebe
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
makin
'
her
out
;
sometimes
she
's
for
one
thing
,
sometimes
she
's
for
another
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
bid
me
come
and
see
her
,
"
said
Kester
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Only
this
mornin
'
,
at
missus
'
buryin
'
,
she
telled
me
to
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
Phoebe
went
off
to
inform
Sylvia
that
Kester
was
there
;
and
returned
with
the
desire
that
he
would
walk
into
the
parlour
.
<EOS>
An
instant
after
he
was
gone
,
Phoebe
heard
him
return
,
and
carefully
shut
the
two
doors
of
communication
between
the
kitchen
and
sitting
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
was
in
the
latter
when
Kester
came
in
,
holding
her
baby
close
to
her
;
indeed
,
she
seldom
let
it
go
now
-
a
-
days
to
any
one
else
,
making
Nancy
's
place
quite
a
sinecure
,
much
to
Phoebe
's
indignation
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
's
face
was
shrunk
,
and
white
,
and
thin
;
her
lovely
eyes
alone
retained
the
youthful
,
almost
childlike
,
expression
.
<EOS>
She
went
up
to
Kester
,
and
shook
his
horny
hand
,
she
herself
trembling
all
over
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
talk
to
me
of
her
,
"
she
said
hastily
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
stand
it
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
blessing
for
her
to
be
gone
,
but
,
<EOS>
oh
   
'
  
<EOS>
She
began
to
cry
,
and
then
cheered
herself
up
,
and
swallowed
down
her
sobs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Kester
,
"
she
went
on
,
hastily
,
"
Charley
Kinraid

n't
dead

<EOS>
He
's

and

A

<EOS>

Then
he

gone

said
Sylvia
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gone

ay
,
days
past

<EOS>
As
far
as
a
know

he
but
stopped

A
thought
to
mysel
'
<EOS>
(
but
yo
'
may
be
sure
a
said
nought
to
nobody
)
,
he
's
heerd
as
our
Sylvia
were
married
,
and
has
put
it
in
his
pipe
,
and
ta'en
hissel
'
off
to
smoke
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Kester
!
"
said
Sylvia
,
leaning
forwards
,
and
whispering
.
<EOS>
"
I
saw
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
here
.
<EOS>
Philip
saw
him
.
<EOS>
Philip
had
known
as
he
was
n't
dead
a
'
this
time

<EOS>
Kester
stood
up
suddenly
.
  
<EOS>
"
By
goom
,
that
chap
has
a
deal
t
'
answer
for
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
bright
red
spot
was
on
each
of
Sylvia
's
white
cheeks
;
and
for
a
minute
or
so
neither
of
them
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
Then
she
went
on
,
still
whispering
out
her
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
Kester
,
I
'm
more
afeared
than
I
dare
tell
any
one
:
can
they
ha
'
met
,
think
yo
'
?
<EOS>
T
'
very
thought
turns
me
sick
.
<EOS>
I
told
Philip
my
mind
,
and
took
a
vow
again
'
him
 
<EOS>
but
it
would
be
awful
to
think
on
harm
happening
to
him
through
Kinraid
.
<EOS>
Yet
he
went
out
that
morning
,
and
has
niver
been
seen
or
heard
on
sin
'
;
and
Kinraid
were
just
fell
again
'
him
,
and
as
for
that
matter
,
so
was
I
;
but
   
'
  
<EOS>
The
red
spot
vanished
as
she
faced
her
own
imagination
.
  
<EOS>
Kester
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
thing
as
can
be
easy
looked
into

What
day

were
it
when
Philip
left
this
house

Tuesday
 
the
day
she
died

<EOS>
I
saw
him
in
her
room
that
morning
between
breakfast
and
dinner
;
I
could
a'most
swear
to
it
's
being
close
after
eleven

I

counting

here

By
-
and

by
Kester
came
back
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
though
Sylvia
had
never
stirred
;
she
looked
eagerly
at
him

did
not

"
  
"
Thank
yo

Kester

"
said
Sylvia
,
falling
back
in
her
chair
,
as
if
all
the
energy
that
had
kept
her
stiff
and
upright
was
gone
now
that
her
anxiety
was
relieved
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
silent
for
a
long
time
;
her
eyes
shut
,
her
cheek
laid
on
her
child
's
head
.
<EOS>
Kester
spoke
next
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
think
it
's
pretty
clear
as
they'n
niver
met
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
a
'
t
'
more
wonder
where
thy
husband
's
gone
to
.
<EOS>
Thee
and
him
had
words
about
it
,
and
thou
telled
him
thy
mind
,
thou
said
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
not
moving
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afeared
lest
mother
knows
what
I
said
to
him
,
there
,
where
she
's
gone
to
 
<EOS>
I
am
 
<EOS>
'
the
tears
filled
her
shut
eyes
,
and
came
softly
overflowing
down
her
cheeks
;
"
and
yet
it
were
true
<EOS>
,
what
I
said
,
I
can
not
forgive
him
;
he
's
just
spoilt
my
life
,
and
I
'm
not
one
-
and
-
twenty
yet
,
and
he
knowed
how
wretched
,
how
very
wretched
,
I
were
.
<EOS>
A
word
fra
'
<EOS>
him
would
ha
'
mended
it
a
'
;
and
Charley
had
bid
him
speak
the
word
,
and
give
me
his
faithful
love
,
and
Philip
saw
my
heart
ache
day
after
day
,
and
niver
let
on
as
him
I
was
mourning
for
was
alive
,
and
had
sent
me
word
as
he
'd
keep
true
to
me
,
as
I
were
to
do
to
him
.

<EOS>
"
A
wish
a'd
been
theere

a'd
ha
'
felled
him
to

'
ground

"
said
Kester
,
clenching
his
stiff
,
hard
hand
with
indignation
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
was
silent
again
:
pale
and
weary
<EOS>
she
sate
,
her
eyes
still
shut
.
  
<EOS>
Then
she
said
,
  
"
<EOS>
Yet
he
were
so
good
to
mother
;
and
mother
loved
him
so
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Kester
!
"
<EOS>
lifting
herself
up
,
opening
her
great
wistful
eyes
,
"
it
's
well
for

"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
shivered
all
over
,
and
hesitated
before
she
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
dunnot

<EOS>
I
said
such

"
Well

<EOS>
said
Kester
,
<EOS>
sorry
that
he
had
asked
the
question
which
was
producing
so
much
emotion
of
one
kind
or
another

<EOS>
Neither

said
Sylvia
,
with
the
indifference
of
one
wearied
out
with
feeling

<EOS>
He
stood
up
and
shook
hands
with
her
.
<EOS>
As
he
did
so
,
he
looked
at
her
sleeping
baby

A

"
  
<EOS>
With
the
heavy
sound
of
his
out
-
going
footsteps
,
baby
awoke
.
<EOS>
She
ought
before
this
time
to
have
been
asleep
in
her
bed
,
and
the
disturbance
made
her
cry
fretfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
thee
,
darling
,
hush
thee
!
"
<EOS>
murmured
her
mother
;
"
there

<EOS>
Hush

"
  
<EOS>
She
whispered
soft
in
the
little
one
's
ear
as
she
took
her
upstairs
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
About
three
weeks
after
the
miserable
date
of
Bell
Robson
's
death
and
Philip
's
disappearance
,
Hester
Rose
received
a
letter
from
him
.
<EOS>
She
knew
the
writing
on
the
address
well
;
and
it
made
her
tremble
so
much
that
it
was
many
minutes
before
she
dared
to
open
it
,
and
make
herself
acquainted
with
the
facts
it
might
disclose
.
  
<EOS>
But
she
need
not
have
feared
;
there
were
no
facts
told
,
unless
the
vague
date
of
"
London
"
might
be
something
to
learn
.
<EOS>
Even
that
much
might
have
been
found
out
by
the
post
-
mark
,
only
she
had
been
too
much
taken
by
surprise
to
examine
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
ran
as
follows
:
     
<EOS>
"
DEAR
HESTER
,
    
"
Tell
those
whom
it
may
concern
,
that
I
have
left
Monkshaven
for
ever
.
<EOS>
No
one
need
trouble
themselves
about
me
;
I
am
provided
for
.
<EOS>
Please
to
make
my
humble
apologies
to
my
kind
friends
,
the
Messrs
Foster
,
and
to
my
partner
,
William
Coulson
.
<EOS>
Please
to
accept
of
my
love
,
and
to
join
the
same
to
your
mother
.
<EOS>
Please
to
give
my
particular
and
respectful
duty
and
kind
love
to
my
aunt
Isabella
Robson
.
<EOS>
Her
daughter
Sylvia
knows
what
I
have
always
felt
,
and
shall
always
feel
,
for
her
better
than
I
can
ever
put
into
language
,
so
I
send
her
no
message
;
God
bless
and
keep
my
child
.
<EOS>
You
must
all
look
on
me
as
one
dead
;
as
I
am
to
you
,
and
maybe
shall
soon
be
in
reality
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
affectionate
and
obedient
friend

"
PHILIP
HEPBURN
.
  
<EOS>
"
P.S.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
Hester
!
<EOS>
for
God
's
sake
and
mine
,
look
after
(
"
my
wife
,
"
scratched
out
)
Sylvia
and
my
child
.
<EOS>
I
think
Jeremiah
Foster
will
help
you
to
be
a
friend
to
them
.
<EOS>
This
is
the
last
solemn
request
of
<EOS>
P.
H.
She
is
but
very
young
.
"
   
<EOS>
Hester
read
this
letter
again
and
again
,
till
her
heart
caught
the
echo
of
its
hopelessness
,
and
sank
within
her
.
<EOS>
She
put
it
in
her
pocket
,
and
reflected
upon
it
all
the
day
long
as
she
served
in
the
shop
.
  
<EOS>
The
customers
found
her
as
gentle
,
but
far
more
inattentive
than
usual
.
<EOS>
She
thought
that
in
the
evening
she
would
go
across
the
bridge
,
and
consult
with
the
two
good
old
brothers
Foster
.
<EOS>
But
something
occurred
to
put
off
the
fulfilment
of
this
plan
.
  
<EOS>
That
same
morning
Sylvia
had
preceded
her
,
with
no
one
to
consult
,
because
consultation
would
have
required
previous
confidence
,
and
confidence
would
have
necessitated
such
a
confession
about
Kinraid
as
it
was
most
difficult
for
Sylvia
to
make
.
<EOS>
The
poor
young
wife
yet
felt
that
some
step
must
be
taken
by
her
;
and
what
it
was
to
be
<EOS>
she
could
not
imagine
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
no
home
to
go
to
;
for
as
Philip
was
gone
away
,
she
remained
where
she
was
only
on
sufferance
;
she
did
not
know
what
means
of
livelihood
she
had
;
she
was
willing
to
work
,
<EOS>
nay
,
would
be
thankful
to
take
up
her
old
life
of
country
labour
;
but
with
her
baby
,
what
could
she
do
?
  
<EOS>
In
this
dilemma
,
the
recollection
of
the
old
man
's
kindly
speech
and
offer
of
assistance
,
made
,
it
is
true
,
half
in
joke
,
at
the
end
of
her
wedding
visit
,
came
into
her
mind
;
and
she
resolved
to
go
and
ask
for
some
of
the
friendly
counsel
and
assistance
then
offered
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
be
the
first
time
of
her
going
out
since
her
mother
's
funeral
,
and
she
dreaded
the
effort
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
More
even
than
on
that
account
did
she
shrink
from
going
into
the
streets
again
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
get
over
the
impression
that
Kinraid
must
be
lingering
near
;
and
she
distrusted
herself
so
much
that
it
was
a
positive
terror
to
think
of
meeting
him
again
.
<EOS>
She
felt
as
though
,
if
she
but
caught
a
sight
of
him
,
the
glitter
of
his
uniform
,
or
heard
his
well
-
known
voice
in
only
a
distant
syllable
of
talk
,
her
heart
would
stop
,
and
she
should
die
from
very
fright
of
what
would
come
next
.
<EOS>
Or
rather
so
she
felt
,
and
<EOS>
so
she
thought
before
she
took
her
baby
in
her
arms
,
as
Nancy
gave
it
to
her
after
putting
on
its
out
-
of
-
door
attire
.
  
<EOS>
With
it
in
her
arms
she
was
protected
,
and
the
whole
current
of
her
thoughts
was
changed
.
<EOS>
The
infant
was
wailing
and
suffering
with
its
teething
,
and
the
mother
's
heart
was
so
occupied
in
soothing
and
consoling
her
moaning
child
,
that
the
dangerous
quay
-
side
and
the
bridge
were
passed
almost
before
she
was
aware
;
nor
did
she
notice
the
eager
curiosity
and
respectful
attention
of
those
she
met
who
recognized
her
even
through
the
heavy
veil
which
formed
part
of
the
draping
mourning
provided
for
her
by
Hester
and
Coulson
,
in
the
first
unconscious
days
after
her
mother
's
death
.
  
<EOS>
Though
public
opinion
as
yet
reserved
its
verdict
upon
Philip
's
disappearance
 
warned
possibly
by
Kinraid
's
story
against
hasty
decisions
and
judgments
in
such
times
as
those
of
war
and
general
disturbance
 
yet
every
one
agreed
that
no
more
pitiful
fate
could
have
befallen
Philip
's
wife
.
  
<EOS>
Marked
out
by
her
striking
beauty
as
an
object
of
admiring
interest
even
in
those
days
when
she
sate
in
girlhood
's
smiling
peace
by
her
mother
at
the
Market
Cross
 
<EOS>
her
father
had
lost
his
life
in
a
popular
cause
,
and
ignominious
as
the
manner
of
his
death
might
be
,
he
was
looked
upon
as
a
martyr
to
his
zeal
in
avenging
the
wrongs
of
his
townsmen
;
Sylvia
had
married
amongst
them
too
,
and
her
quiet
daily
life
was
well
known
to
them
;
and
now
her
husband
had
been
carried
off
from
her
side
just
on
the
very
day
when
she
needed
his
comfort
most
.
  
<EOS>
For
the
general
opinion
was
that
Philip
had
been
"
carried
off
"
 
in
seaport
towns
such
occurrences
were
not
uncommon
in
those
days
 
either
by
land
-
crimps
or
water
-
crimps
.
  
<EOS>
So
Sylvia
was
treated
with
silent
reverence
,
as
one
sorely
afflicted
,
by
all
the
unheeded
people
she
met
in
her
faltering
walk
to
Jeremiah
Foster
's
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
calculated
her
time
so
as
to
fall
in
with
him
at
his
dinner
hour
,
even
though
it
obliged
her
to
go
to
his
own
house
rather
than
to
the
bank
where
he
and
his
brother
spent
all
the
business
hours
of
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
was
so
nearly
exhausted
by
the
length
of
her
walk
and
the
weight
of
her
baby
,
that
all
she
could
do
when
the
door
was
opened
was
to
totter
into
the
nearest
seat
,
sit
down
,
and
begin
to
cry
.
  
<EOS>
In
an
instant
kind
hands
were
about
her
,
loosening
her
heavy
cloak
,
offering
to
relieve
her
of
her
child
,
who
clung
to
her
all
the
more
firmly
,
and
some
one
was
pressing
a
glass
of
wine
against
her
lips
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
I
can
not
take
it
!
<EOS>
wine
allays
gives
me
th
'
headache
;
if
I
might
have
just
a
drink
o
'
water
.
<EOS>
Thank
you
,
ma'am
"
(
to
the
respectable
-
looking
old
servant
)
,
"
I
'm
well
enough
now
;
and
perhaps
,
sir
,
I
might
speak
a
word
with
yo
'
,
<EOS>
for
it
's
that
I
've
come
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
pity
,
Sylvia
Hepburn
,
as
thee
didst
not
come
to
me
at
the
bank
,
for
it
's
been
a
long
toil
for
thee
all
this
way
in
the
heat
,
with
thy
child
.
<EOS>
But
if
there
's
aught
I
can
do
or
say
for
thee
,
thou
hast
but
to
name
it
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
Martha
!
<EOS>
wilt
thou
relieve
her
of
her
child
while
she
comes
with
me
into
the
parlour
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
the
wilful
little
Bella
stoutly
refused
to
go
to
any
one
,
and
Sylvia
was
not
willing
to
part
with
her
,
tired
though
she
was
.
  
<EOS>
So
the
baby
was
carried
into
the
parlour
,
and
much
of
her
after
-
life
depended
on
this
trivial
fact
.
  
<EOS>
Once
installed
in
the
easy
-
chair
,
and
face
to
face
with
Jeremiah
,
Sylvia
did
not
know
how
to
begin
.
  
<EOS>
Jeremiah
saw
this
,
and
kindly
gave
her
time
to
recover
herself
,
by
pulling
out
his
great
gold
watch
,
and
letting
the
seal
dangle
before
the
child
's
eyes
,
almost
within
reach
of
the
child
's
eager
little
fingers
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
favours
you
a
deal
,
"
said
he
,
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
More
than
her
father
,
"
he
went
on
,
purposely
introducing
Philip
's
name
,
so
as
to
break
the
ice
;
for
he
rightly
conjectured
she
had
come
to
speak
to
him
about
something
connected
with
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
Still
Sylvia
said
nothing
;
she
was
choking
down
tears
and
shyness
,
and
unwillingness
to
take
as
confidant
a
man
of
whom
she
knew
so
little
,
on
such
slight
ground
<EOS>
(
as
she
now
felt
it
to
be
)
<EOS>
as
the
little
kindly
speech
with
which
she
had
been
dismissed
from
that
house
the
last
time
that
she
entered
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
no
use
keeping
yo
'
,
<EOS>
sir
,
"
she
broke
out
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
about
Philip
as
I
comed
to
speak
.
<EOS>
Do
yo
'
know
any
thing
whatsomever
about
him
?
<EOS>
He
niver
had
a
chance
<EOS>
o
'
saying
anything
,
I
know
;
but
maybe
he
's
written
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
a
line
,
my
poor
young
woman
!
<EOS>
"
said
Jeremiah
,
hastily
putting
an
end
to
that
vain
idea
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
he
's
either
dead
or
gone
away
for
iver
,
"
she
whispered
.
<EOS>
"
I
mun
be
both
feyther
and
mother
to
my
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
!
thee
must
not
give
it
up
,
"
replied
he
.
<EOS>
"
Many
a
one
is
carried
off
to
the
wars
,
or
to
the
tenders
o
'
men
-
<EOS>
o
'
 
war
;
<EOS>
and
then
they
turn
out
to
be
unfit
for
service
,
and
are
sent
home
.
<EOS>
Philip
'll
come
back
before
the
year
's
out
;
thee'll
see
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
he
'll
niver
come
back
.
<EOS>
And
I
'm
not
sure
as
I
should
iver
wish
him
t
'
come
back
,
if
I
could
but
know
what
was
gone
wi
'
him
.
<EOS>
Yo
'
see
,
sir
,
though
I
were
sore
set
again
'
<EOS>
him
,
I
should
n't
like
harm
to
happen
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
something
behind
all
this
that
I
do
not
understand
.
<EOS>
Can
thee
tell
me
what
it
is
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
,
sir
,
if
yo're
to
help
me
wi
'
your
counsel
;
and
I
came
up
here
to
ask
for
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Another
long
pause
,
during
which
Jeremiah
made
a
feint
of
playing
with
the
child
,
who
danced
and
shouted
with
tantalized
impatience
at
not
being
able
to
obtain
possession
of
the
seal
,
and
at
length
stretched
out
her
soft
round
little
arms
to
go
to
the
owner
of
the
coveted
possession
.
<EOS>
Surprise
at
this
action
roused
Sylvia
,
and
she
made
some
comment
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
niver
knew
her
t
'
go
to
any
one
afore
.
<EOS>
I
hope
she
'll
not
be
troublesome
to
yo
'
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
man
,
who
had
often
longed
for
a
child
of
his
own
in
days
gone
by
,
was
highly
pleased
by
this
mark
of
baby
's
confidence
,
and
almost
forgot
,
in
trying
to
strengthen
her
regard
by
all
the
winning
wiles
in
his
power
,
how
her
poor
mother
was
still
lingering
over
some
painful
story
which
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
tell
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afeared
of
speaking
wrong
again
'
any
one
,
sir
.
<EOS>
And
mother
were
so
fond
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
Philip
;
but
he
kept
something
from
me
as
would
ha
'
made
me
a
different
woman
,
and
some
one
else
,
happen
,
a
different
man
.
<EOS>
I
were
troth
-
plighted
wi
'
Kinraid
the
specksioneer
,
him
as
was
cousin
to
th
'
Corneys
o
'
Moss
Brow
,
and
comed
back
lieutenant
<EOS>
i
'
t
'
navy
last
Tuesday
three
weeks
,
after
ivery
one
had
thought
him
dead
and
gone
these
three
years
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
paused
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
said
Jeremiah
,
with
interest
;
although
his
attention
appeared
to
be
divided
between
the
mother
's
story
and
the
eager
playfulness
of
the
baby
on
his
knee
.
  
<EOS>
"
Philip
knew
he
were
alive
;
he
'd
seen
him
taken
by
t
'
press
-
gang
,
and
Charley
had
sent
a
message
to
me
by
Philip
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
white
face
was
reddening
,
her
eyes
flashing
at
this
point
of
her
story
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
niver
told
me
a
word
on
it
,
not
<EOS>
when
he
saw
me
like
to
break
my
heart
in
thinking
as
Kinraid
were
dead
;
he
kept
it
a
'
to
hissel
'
;
and
watched
me
cry
,
and
niver
said
a
word
to
comfort
me
wi
'
t
'
truth
.
<EOS>
It
would
ha
'
been
a
great
comfort
,
sir
,
only
t
'
have
had
his
message
<EOS>
if
I
'd
niver
ha
'
been
to
see
him
again
.
<EOS>
But
Philip
niver
let
on
to
any
one
,
as
I
iver
heared
on
,
that
he
'd
seen
Charley
that
morning
as
t
'
press
-
gang
took
him
.
<EOS>
Yo
'
know
about
feyther
's
death
,
and
how
friendless
mother
and
me
was
left
?
<EOS>
and
so
I
married
him
;
for
he
were
a
good
friend
to
us
then
,
and
I
were
dazed
like
wi
'
sorrow
,
and
could
see
naught
else
to
do
for
mother
.
<EOS>
He
were
allays
very
tender
and
good
to
her
,
for
sure
.
"
  
<EOS>
Again
a
long
pause
of
silent
recollection
,
broken
by
one
or
two
deep
sighs
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
go
on
,
sir
,
now
,
I
mun
ask
yo
'
to
promise
as
yo'll
niver
tell
.
<EOS>
I
do
so
need
some
one
to
tell
me
what
I
ought
to
do
,
and
I
were
led
here
,
<EOS>
like
,
else
I
would
ha
'
died
wi
'
it
all
within
my
teeth
.
<EOS>
Yo'll
promise
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
Jeremiah
Foster
looked
in
her
face
,
and
seeing
the
wistful
,
eager
look
,
he
was
touched
almost
against
his
judgment
into
giving
the
promise
required
;
she
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
a
Tuesday
morning
,
three
weeks
ago
,
I
think
,
tho
'
for
t
'
<EOS>
matter
<EOS>
o
'
time
<EOS>
it
might
ha
'
been
three
years
,
Kinraid
come
home
;
come
back
for
t
'
<EOS>
claim
me
as
his
wife
,
and
I
were
we
d
to
Philip
!
<EOS>
I
met
him
<EOS>
i
'
t
'
road
at
first
;
<EOS>
and
I
could
n't
tell
him
theere
.
<EOS>
He
followed
me
into
t
'
house
 
Philip
's
house
,
sir
,
behind
t
'
shop
 
and
somehow
I
told
him
all
,
how
I
were
a
wedded
wife
to
another
.
<EOS>
Then
he
up
and
said
I
'd
a
false
heart
 
me
<EOS>
false
,
sir
,
as
had
eaten
my
daily
bread
in
bitterness
,
and
had
wept
t
'
nights
through
,
all
for
sorrow
and
mourning
for
his
death
!
<EOS>
Then
he
said
as
Philip
knowed
all
t
'
time
he
were
alive
and
coming
back
for
me
;
and
I
could
n't
believe
it
,
and
I
called
Philip
,
and
he
come
,
and
a
'
that
Charley
had
said
were
true
;
and
yet
I
were
Philip
's
wife
!
<EOS>
So
I
took
a
mighty
oath
,
and
I
said
as
I
'd
niver
hold
Philip
to
be
my
lawful
husband
again
,
nor
iver
forgive
him
for
t
'
evil
<EOS>
he
'd
wrought
us
,
but
hold
him
as
a
stranger
and
one
as
had
done
me
a
heavy
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
stopped
speaking
;
her
story
seemed
to
her
to
end
there
.
<EOS>
But
her
listener
said
,
after
a
pause
,
  
<EOS>
"
It
were
a
cruel
wrong
,
I
grant
thee
that
;
but
thy
oath
were
a
sin
,
and
thy
words
were
evil
,
my
poor
lass
.
<EOS>
What
happened
next
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
justly
remember
,
"
she
said
,
wearily
.
"
<EOS>
Kinraid
went
away
,
and
mother
cried
out
;
and
I
went
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
were
asleep
<EOS>
,
I
thought
,
so
I
lay
down
by
her
,
to
wish
I
were
dead
,
and
to
think
on
what
would
come
on
my
child
if
I
died
;
and
Philip
came
in
softly
,
and
I
made
as
if
I
were
asleep
;
and
that
's
t
'
very
last
as
I
've
iver
seen
or
heared
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Jeremiah
Foster
groaned
as
she
ended
her
story
.
<EOS>
Then
he
pulled
himself
up
,
and
said
,
in
a
cheerful
tone
of
voice
,
  
<EOS>
"
He
'll
come
back
,
Sylvia
Hepburn
.
<EOS>
He
'll
think
better
of
it
:
never
fear
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
fear
his
coming
back
!
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
's
what
I
'm
feared
on
;
I
would
wish
as
I
knew
on
his
well
-
doing
i
'
some
other
place
;
but
him
and
me
can
niver
live
together
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
"
pleaded
Jeremiah
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Thee
art
sorry
what
thee
said
;
thee
were
sore
put
about
,
or
thee
would
n't
have
said
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
trying
to
be
a
peace
-
maker
,
and
to
heal
over
conjugal
differences
;
but
he
did
not
go
deep
enough
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
sorry
,
"
said
she
,
slowly
.
<EOS>
"
I
were
too
deeply
wronged
to
be
"
put
about
"
;
that
would
go
off
wi
'
a
night
's
sleep
.
<EOS>
It
's
only
the
thought
of
mother
<EOS>
(
she
's
dead
and
happy
,
and
knows
nought
of
all
this
,
I
trust
)
<EOS>
that
comes
between
me
and
hating
Philip
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
sorry
for
what
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
  
Jeremiah
had
never
met
with
any
one
so
frank
and
undisguised
in
expressions
of
wrong
feeling
,
and
he
scarcely
knew
what
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
He
looked
extremely
grieved
,
and
not
a
little
shocked
.
<EOS>
So
pretty
and
delicate
a
young
creature
to
use
such
strong
relentless
language
!
  
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
read
his
thoughts
,
for
she
made
answer
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
you
think
I
'm
very
wicked
,
sir
,
not
to
be
sorry
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
am
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
think
o
'
<EOS>
that
for
remembering
how
I
've
suffered
;
and
he
knew
how
miserable
I
was
,
and
might
ha
'
cleared
my
misery
away
wi
'
a
word
;
and
he
held
his
peace
,
and
now
it
's
too
late
!
<EOS>
I
'm
sick
o
'
men
and
their
cruel
,
deceitful
ways
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
were
dead
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
crying
before
she
had
ended
this
speech
,
and
seeing
her
tears
,
the
child
began
to
cry
too
,
stretching
out
its
little
arms
to
go
back
to
its
mother
.
<EOS>
The
hard
stony
look
on
her
face
melted
away
into
the
softest
,
tenderest
love
as
she
clasped
the
little
one
to
her
,
and
tried
to
soothe
its
frightened
sobs
.
  
<EOS>
A
bright
thought
came
into
the
old
man
's
mind
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
been
taking
a
complete
dislike
to
her
till
her
pretty
way
with
<EOS>
her
baby
showed
him
that
she
had
a
heart
of
flesh
within
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
little
one
!
<EOS>
"
said
he
,
"
thy
mother
had
need
love
thee
,
for
she
's
deprived
thee
of
thy
father
's
love
.
<EOS>
Thou'rt
half
-
way
to
being
an
orphan
;
yet
I
can
not
call
thee
one
of
the
fatherless
to
whom
God
will
be
a
father
.
<EOS>
Thou'rt
a
desolate
babe
,
thou
may'st
well
cry
;
thine
earthly
parents
have
forsaken
thee
,
and
I
know
not
if
the
Lord
will
take
thee
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
looked
up
at
him
affrighted
;
holding
her
baby
tighter
to
her
,
she
exclaimed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
speak
so
,
sir
!
<EOS>
it
's
cursing
,
sir
!
<EOS>
I
have
n't
forsaken
her
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
sir
!
<EOS>
those
are
awful
sayings
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Thee
hast
sworn
never
to
forgive
thy
husband
,
nor
to
live
with
him
again
.
<EOS>
Dost
thee
know
that
by
the
law
of
the
land
,
he
may
claim
his
child
;
and
then
thou
wilt
have
to
forsake
it
,
or
to
be
forsworn
?
<EOS>
Poor
little
maiden
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
continued
he
,
once
more
luring
the
baby
to
him
with
the
temptation
of
the
watch
and
chain
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
thought
for
a
while
before
speaking
.
<EOS>
Then
she
said
,
  
"
I
can
not
tell
what
ways
to
take
.
<EOS>
Whiles
<EOS>
I
think
my
head
is
crazed
.
<EOS>
It
were
a
cruel
turn
<EOS>
he
did
me
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
have
thought
him
guilty
of
such
baseness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
acquiescence
,
which
was
perfectly
honest
on
Jeremiah
's
part
,
almost
took
Sylvia
by
surprise
.
<EOS>
Why
might
she
not
hate
one
who
had
been
both
cruel
and
base
in
his
treatment
of
her
?
<EOS>
And
yet
she
recoiled
from
the
application
of
such
hard
terms
by
another
to
Philip
,
by
a
cool
-
judging
and
indifferent
person
,
as
she
esteemed
Jeremiah
to
be
.
<EOS>
From
some
inscrutable
turn
in
her
thoughts
,
she
began
to
defend
him
,
or
at
least
to
palliate
the
harsh
judgment
which
she
herself
had
been
the
first
to
pronounce
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
were
so
tender
to
mother
;
she
were
dearly
fond
on
him
;
he
niver
spared
aught
he
could
do
for
her
,
else
I
would
niver
ha
'
married
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
was
a
good
and
kind
-
hearted
lad
from
the
time
he
was
fifteen
.
<EOS>
And
I
never
found
him
out
in
any
falsehood
,
no
more
did
my
brother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
were
all
the
same
as
a
lie
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
swiftly
changing
her
ground
,
"
to
leave
me
to
think
as
Charley
were
dead
,
when
he
knowed
all
t
'
time
he
were
alive
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
self
-
seeking
lie
;
putting
thee
to
pain
to
get
his
own
ends
.
<EOS>
And
the
end
of
it
has
been
that
he
is
driven
forth
like
Cain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
niver
told
him
to
go
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
thy
words
sent
him
forth
,
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
unsay
them
,
sir
;
and
I
believe
as
I
should
say
them
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
she
said
this
as
one
who
rather
hopes
for
a
contradiction
.
  
<EOS>
All
Jeremiah
replied
,
however
,
was
,
"
Poor
wee
child
!
"
<EOS>
in
a
pitiful
tone
,
addressed
to
the
baby
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
's
eyes
filled
with
tears
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
sir
,
I
'll
do
anything
as
iver
yo
'
can
tell
me
for
her
.
<EOS>
That
's
what
I
came
for
t
'
ask
yo
'
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
mun
not
stay
theere
,
and
Philip
gone
away
;
and
I
dunnot
know
what
to
do
:
and
I
'll
do
aught
,
only
I
must
keep
her
wi
'
me
.
<EOS>
Whativer
can
I
do
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Jeremiah
thought
it
over
for
a
minute
or
two
.
<EOS>
Then
he
replied
,
  
"
I
must
have
time
to
think
.
<EOS>
I
must
talk
it
over
with
brother
John
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
've
given
me
yo'r
word
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
given
thee
my
word
never
to
tell
any
one
of
what
has
passed
between
thee
and
thy
husband
,
but
I
must
take
counsel
with
my
brother
as
to
what
is
to
be
done
with
thee
and
thy
child
,
now
that
thy
husband
has
left
the
shop
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
said
so
gravely
as
almost
to
be
a
reproach
,
and
he
got
up
,
as
a
sign
that
the
interview
was
ended
.
  
<EOS>
He
gave
the
baby
back
to
its
mother
;
but
not
without
a
solemn
blessing
,
<EOS>
so
solemn
that
,
to
Sylvia
's
superstitious
and
excited
mind
,
it
undid
the
terrors
of
what
she
had
esteemed
to
be
a
curse
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
Lord
bless
thee
and
keep
thee
!
<EOS>
The
Lord
make
His
face
to
shine
upon
thee
!
"
  
<EOS>
All
the
way
down
the
hill
-
side
,
Sylvia
kept
kissing
the
child
,
and
whispering
to
its
unconscious
ears
,
    
"
I
'll
love
thee
for
both
,
my
treasure
,
I
will
.
<EOS>
I
'll
hap
thee
round
wi
'
my
love
,
so
as
thou
shall
niver
need
a
feyther
's
.

<EOS>
BEREAVEMENT
  
<EOS>
Hester
had
been
prevented
by
her
mother
's
indisposition
from
taking
Philip
's
letter
to
the
Fosters
,
to
hold
a
consultation
with
them
over
its
contents
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
Rose
was
slowly
failing
,
and
the
long
days
which
she
had
to
spend
alone
told
much
upon
her
spirits
,
and
consequently
upon
her
health
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
came
out
in
the
conversation
which
ensued
after
reading
Hepburn
's
letter
in
the
little
parlour
at
the
bank
on
the
day
after
Sylvia
had
had
her
confidential
interview
with
Jeremiah
Foster
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
a
true
man
of
honour
,
and
never
so
much
as
alluded
to
her
visit
to
him
;
but
what
she
had
then
told
him
influenced
him
very
much
in
the
formation
of
the
project
which
he
proposed
to
his
brother
and
Hester
.
  
<EOS>
He
recommended
her
remaining
where
she
was
,
living
still
in
the
house
behind
the
shop
;
for
he
thought
within
himself
that
she
might
have
exaggerated
the
effect
of
her
words
upon
Philip
;
that
,
after
all
,
it
might
have
been
some
cause
totally
disconnected
with
them
,
which
had
blotted
out
her
husband
's
place
among
the
men
of
Monkshaven
;
and
that
it
would
be
so
much
easier
for
both
to
resume
their
natural
relations
,
both
towards
each
other
and
towards
the
world
,
if
Sylvia
remained
where
her
husband
had
left
her
 
in
an
expectant
attitude
,
so
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
Jeremiah
Foster
questioned
Hester
straitly
about
her
letter
:
whether
she
had
made
known
its
contents
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
No
,
not
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
Neither
to
her
mother
nor
to
William
Coulson
?
<EOS>
No
,
to
neither
.
  
<EOS>
She
looked
at
him
as
she
replied
to
his
inquiries
,
and
he
looked
at
her
,
each
wondering
if
the
other
could
be
in
the
least
<EOS>
aware
that
a
conjugal
quarrel
might
be
at
the
root
of
the
dilemma
in
which
they
were
placed
by
Hepburn
's
disappearance
.
  
<EOS>
But
neither
Hester
,
who
had
witnessed
the
misunderstanding
between
the
husband
and
wife
on
the
evening
,
before
the
morning
on
which
Philip
went
away
,
nor
Jeremiah
Foster
,
who
had
learnt
from
Sylvia
the
true
reason
of
her
husband
's
disappearance
,
gave
the
slightest
reason
to
the
other
to
think
that
they
each
supposed
they
had
a
clue
to
the
reason
of
Hepburn
's
sudden
departure
.
  
<EOS>
What
Jeremiah
Foster
,
after
a
night
's
consideration
,
had
to
propose
was
this
;
that
Hester
and
her
mother
should
come
and
occupy
the
house
in
the
market
-
place
,
conjointly
with
Sylvia
and
her
child
.
<EOS>
Hester
's
interest
in
the
shop
was
by
this
time
acknowledged
.
<EOS>
Jeremiah
had
made
over
to
her
so
much
of
his
share
in
the
business
,
that
she
had
a
right
to
be
considered
as
a
kind
of
partner
;
and
she
had
long
been
the
superintendent
of
that
department
of
goods
which
were
exclusively
devoted
to
women
.
<EOS>
So
her
daily
presence
was
requisite
for
more
reasons
than
one
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
her
mother
's
health
and
spirits
were
such
as
to
render
it
unadvisable
that
the
old
woman
should
be
too
much
left
alone
;
and
Sylvia
's
devotion
to
her
own
mother
seemed
to
point
her
out
as
the
very
person
who
could
be
a
gentle
and
tender
companion
to
Alice
Rose
during
those
hours
when
her
own
daughter
would
necessarily
be
engaged
in
the
shop
.
  
<EOS>
Many
desirable
objects
seemed
to
be
gained
by
this
removal
of
Alice
:
an
occupation
was
provided
for
Sylvia
,
which
would
detain
her
in
the
place
where
her
husband
had
left
her
,
and
where
(
Jeremiah
Foster
fairly
expected
in
spite
of
his
letter
)
<EOS>
he
was
likely
to
come
back
to
find
her
;
and
Alice
Rose
,
the
early
love
of
one
of
the
brothers
,
the
old
friend
of
the
other
,
would
be
well
cared
for
,
and
under
her
daughter
's
immediate
supervision
during
the
whole
of
the
time
that
she
was
occupied
in
the
shop
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
's
share
of
the
business
,
augmented
by
the
money
which
he
had
put
in
from
the
legacy
of
his
old
Cumberland
uncle
,
would
bring
in
profits
enough
to
support
Sylvia
and
her
child
in
ease
and
comfort
until
that
time
,
which
they
all
anticipated
,
when
he
should
return
from
his
mysterious
wandering
 
mysterious
,
whether
his
going
forth
had
been
voluntary
or
involuntary
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
far
was
settled
;
and
Jeremiah
Foster
went
to
tell
Sylvia
of
the
plan
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
too
much
a
child
,
too
entirely
unaccustomed
to
any
independence
of
action
,
to
do
anything
but
leave
herself
in
his
hands
.
<EOS>
Her
very
confession
,
made
to
him
the
day
before
,
when
she
sought
his
counsel
,
seemed
to
place
her
at
his
disposal
.
<EOS>
Otherwise
,
she
had
had
notions
of
the
possibility
of
a
free
country
life
once
more
 
<EOS>
how
provided
for
and
arranged
she
hardly
knew
;
but
Haytersbank
was
to
let
,
and
Kester
disengaged
,
and
it
had
just
seemed
possible
that
she
might
have
to
return
to
her
early
home
,
and
to
her
old
life
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
it
would
take
much
money
to
stock
the
farm
again
,
and
that
her
hands
were
tied
from
much
useful
activity
by
the
love
and
care
she
owed
to
her
baby
.
<EOS>
But
still
,
somehow
,
she
hoped
and
she
fancied
,
till
Jeremiah
Foster
's
measured
words
and
carefully
-
arranged
plan
made
her
silently
relinquish
her
green
,
breezy
vision
.
  
<EOS>
Hester
,
too
,
had
her
own
private
rebellion
 
hushed
into
submission
by
her
gentle
piety
.
<EOS>
If
Sylvia
had
been
able
to
make
Philip
happy
,
Hester
could
have
felt
lovingly
and
almost
gratefully
towards
her
;
but
Sylvia
had
failed
in
this
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
had
been
made
unhappy
,
and
was
driven
forth
a
wanderer
into
the
wide
world
 
never
to
come
back
!
<EOS>
And
his
last
words
to
Hester
,
the
postscript
of
his
letter
,
containing
the
very
pith
of
it
,
was
to
ask
her
to
take
charge
and
care
of
the
wife
whose
want
of
love
towards
him
had
uprooted
him
from
the
place
where
he
was
valued
and
honoured
.
  
<EOS>
It
cost
Hester
many
a
struggle
and
many
a
self
-
reproach
before
she
could
make
herself
feel
what
she
saw
all
along
 
that
in
everything
Philip
treated
her
like
a
sister
.
<EOS>
But
even
a
sister
might
well
be
indignant
if
she
saw
her
brother
's
love
disregarded
and
slighted
,
and
his
life
embittered
by
the
thoughtless
conduct
of
a
wife
!
<EOS>
Still
Hester
fought
against
herself
,
and
for
Philip
's
sake
she
sought
to
see
the
good
in
Sylvia
,
and
she
strove
to
love
her
as
well
as
to
take
care
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
With
the
baby
,
of
course
,
the
case
was
different
.
<EOS>
Without
thought
or
struggle
,
or
reason
,
every
one
loved
the
little
girl
.
<EOS>
Coulson
and
his
buxom
wife
,
who
were
childless
,
were
never
weary
of
making
much
of
her
.
<EOS>
Hester
's
happiest
hours
were
spent
with
that
little
child
.
<EOS>
Jeremiah
Foster
almost
looked
upon
her
as
his
own
from
the
day
when
she
honoured
him
by
yielding
to
the
temptation
of
the
chain
and
seal
,
and
coming
to
his
knee
;
not
a
customer
to
the
shop
but
knew
the
smiling
child
's
sad
history
,
and
many
a
country
-
woman
would
save
a
rosy
-
cheeked
apple
from
out
her
store
that
autumn
to
bring
it
on
next
market
-
day
for
"
Philip
Hepburn
's
baby
,
as
had
lost
its
father
,
bless
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Even
stern
Alice
Rose
was
graciously
inclined
towards
the
little
Bella
;
and
though
her
idea
of
the
number
of
the
elect
was
growing
narrower
and
narrower
every
day
,
she
would
have
been
loth
to
exclude
the
innocent
little
child
,
that
stroked
her
wrinkled
cheeks
so
softly
every
night
in
return
for
her
blessing
,
from
the
few
that
should
be
saved
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
for
the
child
's
sake
,
she
relented
towards
the
mother
;
and
strove
to
have
Sylvia
rescued
from
the
many
castaways
with
fervent
prayer
,
or
,
as
she
phrased
it
,
"
wrestling
with
the
Lord
"
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
had
a
sort
of
instinct
that
the
little
child
,
so
tenderly
loved
by
,
so
fondly
loving
,
the
mother
whose
ewe
-
lamb
<EOS>
she
was
,
could
not
be
even
in
heaven
without
yearning
for
the
creature
she
had
loved
best
on
earth
;
and
the
old
woman
believed
that
this
was
the
principal
reason
for
her
prayers
for
Sylvia
;
but
unconsciously
to
herself
,
Alice
Rose
was
touched
by
the
filial
attentions
she
constantly
received
from
the
young
mother
,
whom
she
believed
to
be
foredoomed
to
condemnation
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
rarely
went
to
church
or
chapel
,
nor
did
she
read
her
Bible
;
for
though
she
spoke
little
of
her
ignorance
,
and
would
fain
,
for
her
child
's
sake
,
have
remedied
it
now
<EOS>
it
was
too
late
,
she
had
lost
what
little
fluency
of
reading
she
had
ever
had
,
and
could
only
make
out
her
words
with
much
spelling
and
difficulty
.
<EOS>
So
the
taking
her
Bible
in
hand
would
have
been
a
mere
form
;
though
of
this
Alice
Rose
knew
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
No
one
knew
much
of
what
was
passing
in
Sylvia
;
she
did
not
know
herself
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
in
the
nights
she
would
waken
,
crying
,
with
a
terrible
sense
of
desolation
;
every
one
who
loved
her
,
or
whom
she
had
loved
,
had
vanished
out
of
her
life
;
every
one
but
her
child
,
who
lay
in
her
arms
,
warm
and
soft
.
  
<EOS>
But
then
Jeremiah
Foster
's
words
came
upon
her
;
<EOS>
words
that
she
had
taken
for
cursing
at
the
time
;
and
she
would
so
gladly
have
had
some
clue
by
which
to
penetrate
the
darkness
of
the
unknown
region
from
whence
both
blessing
and
cursing
came
,
and
to
know
if
she
had
indeed
done
something
which
should
cause
her
sin
to
be
visited
on
that
soft
,
sweet
,
innocent
darling
.
  
<EOS>
If
any
one
would
teach
her
to
read
!
<EOS>
If
any
one
would
explain
to
her
the
hard
words
she
heard
in
church
or
chapel
,
so
that
she
might
find
out
the
meaning
of
sin
and
godliness
!
 
<EOS>
words
that
had
only
passed
over
the
surface
of
her
mind
till
now
!
<EOS>
For
her
child
's
sake
she
should
like
to
do
the
will
of
God
,
if
she
only
knew
what
that
was
,
and
how
to
be
worked
out
in
her
daily
life
.
  
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
one
she
dared
confess
her
ignorance
to
and
ask
information
from
.
<EOS>
Jeremiah
Foster
had
spoken
as
if
her
child
,
sweet
little
merry
Bella
,
with
a
loving
word
and
a
kiss
for
every
one
,
was
to
suffer
heavily
for
the
just
and
true
words
her
wronged
and
indignant
mother
had
spoken
.
<EOS>
Alice
always
spoke
as
if
there
were
no
hope
for
her
;
and
blamed
her
,
nevertheless
,
for
not
using
the
means
of
grace
that
it
was
not
in
her
power
to
avail
herself
of
.
  
<EOS>
And
Hester
,
that
Sylvia
would
fain
have
loved
for
her
uniform
gentleness
and
patience
with
all
around
her
,
seemed
so
cold
in
her
unruffled
and
undemonstrative
behaviour
;
and
moreover
,
Sylvia
felt
that
Hester
blamed
her
perpetual
silence
regarding
Philip
's
absence
without
knowing
how
bitter
a
cause
Sylvia
had
for
casting
him
off
.
  
<EOS>
The
only
person
who
seemed
to
have
pity
upon
her
was
Kester
;
and
his
pity
was
shown
in
looks
rather
than
words
;
for
when
he
came
to
see
her
,
which
he
did
from
time
to
time
,
by
a
kind
of
mutual
tacit
consent
,
they
spoke
but
little
of
former
days
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
still
lodging
with
his
sister
,
widow
Dobson
,
working
at
odd
jobs
,
some
of
which
took
him
into
the
country
for
weeks
at
a
time
.
<EOS>
But
on
his
returns
to
Monkshaven
he
was
sure
to
come
and
see
her
and
the
little
Bella
;
indeed
,
when
his
employment
was
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
town
,
he
never
allowed
a
week
to
pass
away
without
a
visit
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
not
much
conversation
between
him
and
Sylvia
at
such
times
.
<EOS>
They
skimmed
over
the
surface
of
the
small
events
in
which
both
took
an
interest
;
only
now
and
then
a
sudden
glance
,
a
checked
speech
,
told
each
that
there
were
deeps
not
forgotten
,
although
they
were
never
mentioned
.
  
<EOS>
Twice
Sylvia
 
below
her
breath
 
had
asked
Kester
,
just
as
she
was
holding
the
door
open
for
his
departure
,
if
anything
had
ever
been
heard
of
Kinraid
since
his
one
night
's
visit
to
Monkshaven
:
each
time
(
and
there
was
an
interval
of
some
months
between
the
inquiries
)
<EOS>
the
answer
had
been
simply
,
no
.
  
<EOS>
To
no
one
else
would
Sylvia
ever
have
named
his
name
.
<EOS>
But
indeed
she
had
not
the
chance
,
had
she
wished
it
ever
so
much
,
of
asking
any
questions
about
him
from
any
one
likely
to
know
.
<EOS>
The
Corneys
had
left
Moss
Brow
at
Martinmas
,
and
gone
many
miles
away
towards
Horncastle
.
<EOS>
Bessy
Corney
,
it
is
true
was
married
and
left
behind
in
the
neighbourhood
;
but
with
her
Sylvia
had
never
been
intimate
;
and
what
girlish
friendship
there
might
have
been
between
them
had
cooled
very
much
at
the
time
of
Kinraid
's
supposed
death
three
years
before
.
  
<EOS>
One
day
before
Christmas
in
this
year
,
1798
,
Sylvia
was
called
into
the
shop
by
Coulson
,
who
,
with
his
assistant
,
was
busy
undoing
the
bales
of
winter
goods
supplied
to
them
from
the
West
Riding
,
and
other
places
.
<EOS>
He
was
looking
at
a
fine
Irish
poplin
dress
-
piece
when
Sylvia
answered
to
his
call
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
!
do
you
know
this
again
?
"
<EOS>
asked
he
,
in
the
cheerful
tone
of
one
sure
of
giving
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
have
I
iver
seen
it
afore
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
this
,
but
one
for
all
t
'
world
like
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
did
not
rouse
up
to
much
interest
,
but
looked
at
it
as
if
trying
to
recollect
where
she
could
have
seen
its
like
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
missus
had
one
on
at
th
'
party
at
John
Foster
's
last
March
,
and
yo
'
admired
it
a
deal
.
<EOS>
And
Philip
,
he
thought
o
'
<EOS>
nothing
but
<EOS>
how
he
could
get
yo
'
just
such
another
,
and
he
set
a
vast
o
'
folk
agait
for
to
meet
wi
'
its
marrow
;
and
what
he
did
just
the
very
day
<EOS>
afore
he
went
away
<EOS>
so
mysterious
was
to
write
through
Dawson
Brothers
,
o
'
Wakefield
,
to
Dublin
,
and
order
that
one
should
be
woven
for
yo
'
.
<EOS>
Jemima
had
to
cut
a
bit
off
hers
for
to
give
him
t
'
exact
colour
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
did
not
say
anything
but
that
it
was
very
pretty
,
in
a
low
voice
,
and
then
she
quickly
left
the
shop
,
much
to
Coulson
's
displeasure
.
  
<EOS>
All
the
afternoon
she
was
unusually
quiet
and
depressed
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
Rose
,
sitting
helpless
in
her
chair
,
watched
her
with
keen
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
,
after
one
of
Sylvia
's
deep
,
unconscious
sighs
,
the
old
woman
spoke
:
  
"
It
's
religion
as
must
comfort
thee
,
child
,
as
it
's
done
many
a
one
afore
thee
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
?
"
said
Sylvia
,
looking
up
,
startled
to
find
herself
an
object
of
notice
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
?
"
(
The
answer
was
not
quite
so
ready
as
the
precept
had
been
.
)
<EOS>
"
Read
thy
Bible
,
and
thou
wilt
learn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
can
not
read
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
too
desperate
any
longer
to
conceal
her
ignorance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
read
!
<EOS>
and
thee
Philip
's
wife
as
was
such
a
great
scholar
!
<EOS>
Of
a
surety
the
ways
o
'
this
life
are
crooked
!
<EOS>
There
was
our
Hester
,
as
can
read
as
well
as
any
minister
,
and
Philip
passes
over
her
to
go
and
choose
a
young
lass
as
can
not
read
her
Bible
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Was
Philip
and
Hester
   
'
  
Sylvia
paused
,
for
though
a
new
curiosity
had
dawned
upon
her
,
she
did
not
know
how
to
word
her
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
Many
a
time
and
oft
have
I
seen
Hester
take
comfort
in
her
Bible
when
Philip
was
following
after
thee
.
<EOS>
She
knew
where
to
go
for
consolation
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'd
fain
read
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
humbly
,
"
if
anybody
would
learn
me
;
for
perhaps
it
might
do
me
good
<EOS>
;
I
'm
noane
so
happy
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
eyes
,
as
she
looked
up
at
Alice
's
stern
countenance
,
were
full
of
tears
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
woman
saw
it
,
and
was
touched
,
although
she
did
not
immediately
show
her
sympathy
.
<EOS>
But
she
took
her
own
time
,
and
made
no
reply
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
day
,
however
,
she
bade
Sylvia
come
to
her
,
and
then
and
there
,
as
if
her
pupil
had
been
a
little
child
,
she
began
to
teach
Sylvia
to
read
the
first
chapter
of
Genesis
;
for
all
other
reading
but
the
Scriptures
was
as
vanity
to
her
,
and
she
would
not
condescend
to
the
weakness
of
other
books
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
was
now
,
as
ever
,
slow
at
book
-
learning
;
but
she
was
meek
and
desirous
to
be
taught
,
and
her
willingness
in
this
respect
pleased
Alice
,
and
drew
her
singularly
towards
one
who
,
from
being
a
pupil
,
might
become
a
convert
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
time
Sylvia
never
lost
the
curiosity
that
had
been
excited
by
the
few
words
Alice
had
let
drop
about
Hester
and
Philip
,
and
by
degrees
she
approached
the
subject
again
,
and
had
the
idea
then
started
confirmed
by
Alice
,
who
had
no
scruple
in
using
the
past
experience
of
her
own
,
of
her
daughter
's
,
or
of
any
one
's
life
,
as
an
instrument
to
prove
the
vanity
of
setting
the
heart
on
anything
earthly
.
  
<EOS>
This
knowledge
,
unsuspected
before
,
sank
deep
into
Sylvia
's
thoughts
,
and
gave
her
a
strange
interest
in
Hester
 
poor
Hester
,
whose
life
she
had
so
crossed
and
blighted
,
even
by
the
very
blighting
of
her
own
.
<EOS>
She
gave
Hester
her
own
former
passionate
feelings
for
Kinraid
,
and
wondered
how
she
herself
should
have
felt
towards
any
one
who
had
come
between
her
and
him
,
and
wiled
his
love
away
.
<EOS>
When
she
remembered
Hester
's
unfailing
sweetness
and
kindness
towards
herself
from
the
very
first
,
she
could
better
bear
the
comparative
coldness
of
her
present
behaviour
.
  
<EOS>
She
tried
,
indeed
,
hard
to
win
back
the
favour
she
had
lost
;
but
the
very
means
she
took
were
blunders
,
and
only
made
it
seem
to
her
as
if
she
could
never
again
do
right
in
Hester
's
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
For
instance
,
she
begged
her
to
accept
and
wear
the
pretty
poplin
gown
which
had
been
Philip
's
especial
choice
;
feeling
within
herself
as
if
she
should
never
wish
to
put
it
on
,
and
as
if
the
best
thing
she
could
do
with
it
was
to
offer
it
to
Hester
.
<EOS>
But
Hester
rejected
the
proffered
gift
with
as
much
hardness
of
manner
as
she
was
capable
of
assuming
;
and
Sylvia
had
to
carry
it
upstairs
and
lay
it
by
for
the
little
daughter
,
who
,
Hester
said
,
might
perhaps
learn
to
value
things
that
her
father
had
given
especial
thought
to
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
Sylvia
went
on
trying
to
win
Hester
to
like
her
once
more
;
it
was
one
of
her
great
labours
,
and
learning
to
read
from
Hester
's
mother
was
another
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
,
indeed
,
in
her
solemn
way
,
was
becoming
quite
fond
of
Sylvia
;
if
she
could
not
read
or
write
,
she
had
a
deftness
and
gentleness
of
motion
,
a
capacity
for
the
household
matters
which
fell
into
her
department
,
that
had
a
great
effect
on
the
old
woman
,
and
for
her
dear
mother
's
sake
Sylvia
had
a
stock
of
patient
love
ready
in
her
heart
for
all
the
aged
and
infirm
that
fell
in
her
way
.
<EOS>
She
never
thought
of
seeking
them
out
,
as
she
knew
that
Hester
did
;
but
then
she
looked
up
to
Hester
as
some
one
very
remarkable
for
her
goodness
.
<EOS>
If
only
she
could
have
liked
her
!
  
<EOS>
Hester
tried
to
do
all
she
could
for
Sylvia
;
Philip
had
told
her
to
take
care
of
his
wife
and
child
;
but
she
had
the
conviction
that
Sylvia
had
so
materially
failed
in
her
duties
as
to
have
made
her
husband
an
exile
from
his
home
 
a
penniless
wanderer
,
wifeless
and
childless
,
in
some
strange
country
,
whose
very
aspect
was
friendless
,
while
the
cause
of
all
lived
on
in
the
comfortable
home
where
he
had
placed
her
,
wanting
for
nothing
 
an
object
of
interest
and
regard
to
many
friends
 
with
a
lovely
little
child
to
give
her
joy
for
the
present
,
and
hope
for
the
future
;
while
he
,
the
poor
outcast
,
might
even
lie
dead
by
the
wayside
.
<EOS>
How
could
Hester
love
Sylvia
?
  
<EOS>
Yet
they
were
frequent
companions
that
ensuing
spring
.
<EOS>
Hester
was
not
well
;
and
the
doctors
said
that
the
constant
occupation
in
the
shop
was
too
much
for
her
,
and
that
she
must
,
for
a
time
at
least
,
take
daily
walks
into
the
country
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
used
to
beg
to
accompany
her
;
she
and
the
little
girl
often
went
with
Hester
up
the
valley
of
the
river
to
some
of
the
nestling
farms
that
were
hidden
in
the
more
sheltered
nooks
 
for
Hester
was
bidden
to
drink
milk
warm
from
the
cow
;
and
to
go
into
the
familiar
haunts
about
a
farm
was
one
of
the
few
things
in
which
Sylvia
seemed
to
take
much
pleasure
.
<EOS>
She
would
let
little
Bella
toddle
about
while
Hester
sate
and
rested
:
and
she
herself
would
beg
to
milk
the
cow
destined
to
give
the
invalid
her
draught
.
  
<EOS>
One
May
evening
the
three
had
been
out
on
some
such
expedition
;
the
country
side
still
looked
gray
and
bare
,
though
the
leaves
were
showing
on
the
willow
and
blackthorn
and
sloe
,
and
by
the
tinkling
runnels
,
making
hidden
music
along
the
copse
side
,
the
pale
delicate
primrose
buds
were
showing
amid
their
fresh
,
green
,
crinkled
leaves
.
<EOS>
The
larks
had
been
singing
all
the
afternoon
,
but
were
now
dropping
down
into
their
nests
in
the
pasture
fields
;
the
air
had
just
the
sharpness
in
it
which
goes
along
with
a
cloudless
evening
sky
at
that
time
of
the
year
.
  
<EOS>
But
Hester
walked
homewards
slowly
and
languidly
,
speaking
no
word
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
noticed
this
at
first
without
venturing
to
speak
,
for
Hester
was
one
who
disliked
having
her
ailments
noticed
.
<EOS>
But
after
a
while
Hester
stood
still
in
a
sort
of
weary
dreamy
abstraction
;
and
Sylvia
said
to
her
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afeared
yo're
sadly
tired
.
<EOS>
Maybe
we
've
been
too
far
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hester
almost
started
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
said
she
,
<EOS>
"
it
's
only
my
headache
which
is
worse
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
bad
all
day
;
but
since
I
came
out
it
has
felt
just
as
if
there
were
great
guns
booming
,
till
I
could
almost
pray
'em
to
be
quiet
.
<EOS>
I
am
so
weary
o
'
th
'
sound
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
stepped
out
quickly
towards
home
after
she
had
said
this
,
as
if
she
wished
for
neither
pity
nor
comment
on
what
she
had
said
.
    
<EOS>
THE
RECOGNITION
  
Far
away
,
over
sea
and
land
,
over
sunny
sea
again
,
great
guns
were
booming
on
that
7th
of
May
,
1799
.
  
<EOS>
The
Mediterranean
came
up
with
a
long
roar
on
a
beach
glittering
white
with
snowy
sand
,
and
the
fragments
of
innumerable
sea
-
shells
,
delicate
and
shining
as
porcelain
.
<EOS>
Looking
at
that
shore
from
the
sea
,
a
long
ridge
of
upland
ground
,
beginning
from
an
inland
depth
,
stretched
far
away
into
the
ocean
on
the
right
,
till
it
ended
in
a
great
mountainous
bluff
,
crowned
with
the
white
buildings
of
a
convent
sloping
rapidly
down
into
the
blue
water
at
its
base
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
clear
eastern
air
,
the
different
characters
of
the
foliage
that
clothed
the
sides
of
that
sea
-
washed
mountain
might
be
discerned
from
a
long
distance
by
the
naked
eye
;
the
silver
gray
of
the
olive
-
trees
near
its
summit
;
the
heavy
green
and
bossy
forms
of
the
sycamores
lower
down
;
broken
here
and
there
by
a
solitary
terebinth
or
ilex
tree
,
of
a
deeper
green
and
a
wider
spread
;
till
the
eye
fell
below
on
the
maritime
plain
,
edged
with
the
white
seaboard
and
the
sandy
hillocks
;
with
here
and
there
feathery
palm
-
trees
,
either
isolated
or
in
groups
 
motionless
and
distinct
against
the
hot
purple
air
.
  
<EOS>
Look
again
;
a
little
to
the
left
on
the
sea
-
shore
there
are
the
white
walls
of
a
fortified
town
,
glittering
in
sunlight
,
or
black
in
shadow
.
  
<EOS>
The
fortifications
themselves
run
out
into
the
sea
,
forming
a
port
and
a
haven
against
the
wild
Levantine
storms
;
and
a
lighthouse
rises
out
of
the
waves
to
guide
mariners
into
safety
.
  
<EOS>
Beyond
this
walled
city
,
and
far
away
to
the
left
still
,
there
is
the
same
wide
plain
shut
in
by
the
distant
rising
ground
,
till
the
upland
circuit
comes
closing
in
to
the
north
,
and
the
great
white
rocks
meet
the
deep
tideless
ocean
with
its
intensity
of
blue
colour
.
  
<EOS>
Above
,
the
sky
is
literally
purple
with
heat
;
and
the
pitiless
light
smites
the
gazer
's
weary
eye
as
it
comes
back
from
the
white
shore
.
<EOS>
Nor
does
the
plain
country
in
that
land
offer
the
refuge
and
rest
of
our
own
soft
green
.
<EOS>
The
limestone
rock
underlies
the
vegetation
,
and
gives
a
glittering
,
ashen
hue
to
all
the
bare
patches
,
and
even
to
the
cultivated
parts
which
are
burnt
up
early
in
the
year
.
<EOS>
In
spring
-
time
alone
does
the
country
look
rich
and
fruitful
;
then
the
corn
-
fields
of
the
plain
show
their
capability
of
bearing
,
"
some
fifty
,
some
an
hundred
fold
"
;
down
by
the
brook
Kishon
,
flowing
not
far
from
the
base
of
the
mountainous
promontory
to
the
south
,
there
grow
the
broad
green
fig
-
trees
,
cool
and
fresh
to
look
upon
;
the
orchards
are
full
of
glossy
-
leaved
cherry
-
trees
;
the
tall
amaryllis
puts
forth
crimson
and
yellow
glories
in
the
fields
,
rivalling
the
pomp
of
King
Solomon
;
the
daisies
and
the
hyacinths
spread
their
myriad
flowers
;
the
anemones
,
scarlet
as
blood
,
run
hither
and
thither
over
the
ground
like
dazzling
flames
of
fire
.
  
<EOS>
A
spicy
odour
lingers
in
the
heated
air
;
it
comes
from
the
multitude
of
aromatic
flowers
that
blossom
in
the
early
spring
.
<EOS>
Later
on
they
will
have
withered
and
faded
,
and
the
corn
will
have
been
gathered
,
and
the
deep
green
of
the
eastern
foliage
will
have
assumed
a
kind
of
gray
-
bleached
tint
.
  
<EOS>
Even
now
in
May
,
the
hot
sparkle
of
the
everlasting
sea
,
the
terribly
clear
outline
of
all
objects
,
whether
near
or
distant
,
the
fierce
sun
right
overhead
,
the
dazzling
air
around
,
were
inexpressibly
wearying
to
the
English
eyes
that
kept
their
skilled
watch
,
day
and
night
,
on
the
strongly
-
fortified
coast
-
town
that
lay
out
a
little
to
the
northward
of
where
the
British
ships
were
anchored
.
  
<EOS>
They
had
kept
up
a
flanking
fire
for
many
days
in
aid
of
those
besieged
in
St
Jean
d'Acre
;
and
at
intervals
had
listened
,
impatient
,
to
the
sound
of
the
heavy
siege
guns
,
or
the
sharper
rattle
of
the
French
musketry
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
morning
,
on
the
7th
of
May
,
a
man
at
the
masthead
of
the
_
Tigre
_
sang
out
that
he
saw
ships
in
the
offing
;
and
in
reply
to
the
signal
that
was
hastily
run
up
,
he
saw
the
distant
vessels
hoist
friendly
flags
.
<EOS>
That
May
morning
was
a
busy
time
.
<EOS>
The
besieged
Turks
took
heart
of
grace
;
<EOS>
the
French
outside
,
under
the
command
of
their
great
general
,
made
hasty
preparations
for
a
more
vigorous
assault
than
all
many
,
both
vigorous
and
bloody
,
that
had
gone
before
(
for
the
siege
was
now
at
its
fifty
-
first
day
)
,
in
hopes
of
carrying
the
town
by
storm
before
the
reinforcement
coming
by
sea
could
arrive
;
and
Sir
Sidney
Smith
,
aware
of
Buonaparte
's
desperate
intention
,
ordered
all
the
men
,
both
sailors
and
marines
,
that
could
be
spared
from
the
necessity
of
keeping
up
a
continual
flanking
fire
from
the
ships
upon
the
French
,
to
land
,
and
assist
the
Turks
and
the
British
forces
already
there
in
the
defence
of
the
old
historic
city
.
  
<EOS>
Lieutenant
Kinraid
,
who
had
shared
his
captain
's
daring
adventure
off
the
coast
of
France
three
years
before
,
who
had
been
a
prisoner
with
him
and
Westley
Wright
,
in
the
Temple
at
Paris
,
and
had
escaped
with
them
,
and
,
through
Sir
Sidney
's
earnest
recommendation
,
been
promoted
from
being
a
warrant
officer
to
the
rank
of
lieutenant
,
received
on
this
day
the
honour
from
his
admiral
of
being
appointed
to
an
especial
post
of
danger
.
<EOS>
His
heart
was
like
a
war
-
horse
,
and
said
,
Ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
as
the
boat
bounded
over
the
waves
that
were
to
land
him
under
the
ancient
machicolated
walls
where
the
Crusaders
made
their
last
stand
in
the
Holy
Land
.
<EOS>
Not
that
Kinraid
knew
or
cared
one
jot
about
those
gallant
knights
of
old
:
all
he
knew
was
,
that
the
French
,
under
Boney
,
were
trying
to
take
the
town
from
the
Turks
,
and
that
his
admiral
said
they
must
not
,
and
so
they
should
not
.
  
<EOS>
He
and
his
men
landed
on
that
sandy
shore
,
and
entered
the
town
by
the
water
-
port
gate
;
he
was
singing
to
himself
his
own
country
song
,
      
<EOS>
Weel
may
the
keel
row
,
the
keel
row
,
&
c.
  
and
his
men
,
with
sailors
'
aptitude
for
music
,
caught
up
the
air
,
and
joined
in
the
burden
with
inarticulate
sounds
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
with
merry
hearts
,
they
threaded
the
narrow
streets
of
Acre
,
hemmed
in
on
either
side
by
the
white
walls
of
Turkish
houses
,
with
small
grated
openings
high
up
,
above
all
chance
of
peeping
intrusion
.
  
<EOS>
Here
and
there
they
met
an
ample
-
robed
and
turbaned
Turk
going
along
with
as
much
haste
as
his
stately
self
-
possession
would
allow
.
<EOS>
But
the
majority
of
the
male
inhabitants
were
gathered
together
to
defend
the
breach
,
where
the
French
guns
thundered
out
far
above
the
heads
of
the
sailors
.
  
<EOS>
They
went
along
none
the
less
merrily
for
the
sound
to
Djezzar
Pacha
's
garden
,
where
the
old
Turk
sate
on
his
carpet
,
beneath
the
shade
of
a
great
terebinth
tree
,
listening
to
the
interpreter
,
who
made
known
to
him
the
meaning
of
the
eager
speeches
of
Sir
Sidney
Smith
and
the
colonel
of
the
marines
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
admiral
saw
the
gallant
sailors
of
H.M.S.
_
Tigre
_
,
he
interrupted
the
council
of
war
without
much
ceremony
,
and
going
to
Kinraid
,
he
despatched
them
,
as
before
arranged
,
to
the
North
Ravelin
,
showing
them
the
way
with
rapid
,
clear
directions
.
  
<EOS>
Out
of
respect
to
him
,
they
had
kept
silent
while
in
the
strange
,
desolate
garden
;
but
once
more
in
the
streets
,
the
old
Newcastle
song
rose
up
again
till
the
men
were
,
perforce
,
silenced
by
the
haste
with
which
they
went
to
the
post
of
danger
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
For
many
a
day
these
very
men
had
been
swearing
at
the
terrific
heat
at
this
hour
 
even
when
at
sea
,
fanned
by
the
soft
breeze
;
but
now
,
in
the
midst
of
hot
smoke
,
with
former
carnage
tainting
the
air
,
and
with
the
rush
and
whizz
of
death
perpetually
whistling
in
their
ears
,
they
were
uncomplaining
and
light
-
hearted
.
<EOS>
Many
an
old
joke
,
and
some
new
ones
,
came
brave
and
hearty
,
on
their
cheerful
voices
,
even
though
the
speaker
was
veiled
from
sight
in
great
clouds
of
smoke
,
cloven
only
by
the
bright
flames
of
death
.
  
<EOS>
A
sudden
message
came
;
as
many
of
the
crew
of
the
_
Tigre
_
as
were
under
Lieutenant
Kinraid
's
command
were
to
go
down
to
the
Mole
,
to
assist
the
new
reinforcements
(
seen
by
the
sailor
from
the
masthead
at
day
-
dawn
)
,
under
command
of
Hassan
Bey
,
to
land
at
the
Mole
,
where
Sir
Sidney
then
was
.
  
<EOS>
Off
they
went
,
almost
as
bright
and
thoughtless
as
before
,
though
two
of
their
number
lay
silent
for
ever
at
the
North
Ravelin
 
silenced
in
that
one
little
half
-
hour
.
<EOS>
And
one
went
along
with
the
rest
,
swearing
lustily
at
his
ill
-
luck
in
having
his
right
arm
broken
,
but
ready
to
do
good
business
with
his
left
.
  
<EOS>
They
helped
the
Turkish
troops
to
land
more
with
good
-
will
than
tenderness
;
and
then
,
led
by
Sir
Sidney
,
they
went
under
the
shelter
of
English
guns
to
the
fatal
breach
,
so
often
assailed
,
so
gallantly
defended
,
but
never
so
fiercely
contested
as
on
this
burning
afternoon
.
<EOS>
The
ruins
of
the
massive
wall
that
here
had
been
broken
down
by
the
French
,
were
used
by
them
as
stepping
stones
to
get
on
a
level
with
the
besieged
,
and
so
to
escape
the
heavy
stones
which
the
latter
hurled
down
;
nay
,
even
the
dead
bodies
of
the
morning
's
comrades
were
made
into
ghastly
stairs
.
  
<EOS>
When
Djezzar
Pacha
heard
that
the
British
sailors
were
defending
the
breach
,
headed
by
Sir
Sidney
Smith
,
he
left
his
station
in
the
palace
garden
,
gathered
up
his
robes
in
haste
,
and
hurried
to
the
breach
;
where
,
with
his
own
hands
,
and
with
right
hearty
good
-
will
,
he
pulled
the
sailors
down
from
the
post
of
danger
,
saying
that
if
he
lost
his
English
friends
he
lost
all
!
  
<EOS>
But
little
recked
the
crew
of
the
_
Tigre
_
of
the
one
old
man
 
Pacha
or
otherwise
 
who
tried
to
hold
them
back
from
the
fight
;
they
were
up
and
at
the
French
assailants
clambering
over
the
breach
in
an
instant
;
and
so
they
went
on
,
as
if
it
were
some
game
at
play
instead
of
a
deadly
combat
,
until
Kinraid
and
his
men
were
called
off
by
Sir
Sidney
,
as
the
reinforcement
of
Turkish
troops
under
Hassan
Bey
were
now
sufficient
for
the
defence
of
that
old
breach
in
the
walls
,
which
was
no
longer
the
principal
object
of
the
French
attack
;
for
the
besiegers
had
made
a
new
and
more
formidable
breach
by
their
incessant
fire
,
knocking
down
whole
streets
of
the
city
walls
.
  
<EOS>
"
Fight
your
best
Kinraid
!
"
said
Sir
Sidney
;
"
for
there
's
Boney
on
yonder
hill
looking
at
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
sure
enough
,
on
a
rising
ground
,
called
Richard
Coeur
de
Lion
's
Mount
,
there
was
a
half
-
circle
of
French
generals
,
on
horseback
,
all
deferentially
attending
to
the
motions
,
and
apparently
to
the
words
,
of
a
little
man
in
their
centre
;
at
whose
bidding
the
aide
-
de
-
camp
galloped
swift
with
messages
to
the
more
distant
French
camp
.
  
<EOS>
The
two
ravelins
which
Kinraid
and
his
men
had
to
occupy
,
for
the
purpose
of
sending
a
flanking
fire
upon
the
enemy
,
were
not
ten
yards
from
that
enemy
's
van
.
  
<EOS>
But
at
length
there
was
a
sudden
rush
of
the
French
to
that
part
of
the
wall
where
they
imagined
they
could
enter
unopposed
.
  
<EOS>
Surprised
at
this
movement
,
Kinraid
ventured
out
of
the
shelter
of
the
ravelin
to
ascertain
the
cause
;
he
,
safe
and
untouched
during
that
long
afternoon
of
carnage
,
fell
now
,
under
a
stray
musket
-
shot
,
and
lay
helpless
and
exposed
upon
the
ground
undiscerned
by
his
men
,
who
were
recalled
to
help
in
the
hot
reception
which
had
been
planned
for
the
French
;
who
,
descending
the
city
walls
into
the
Pacha
's
garden
,
were
attacked
with
sabre
and
dagger
,
and
lay
headless
corpses
under
the
flowering
rose
-
bushes
,
and
by
the
fountain
side
.
  
<EOS>
Kinraid
lay
beyond
the
ravelins
,
many
yards
outside
the
city
walls
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
utterly
helpless
,
for
the
shot
had
broken
his
leg
.
<EOS>
Dead
bodies
of
Frenchmen
lay
strewn
around
him
;
no
Englishman
had
ventured
out
so
far
.
  
<EOS>
All
the
wounded
men
that
he
could
see
were
French
;
and
many
of
these
,
furious
with
pain
,
gnashed
their
teeth
at
him
,
and
cursed
him
aloud
,
till
he
thought
that
his
best
course
was
to
assume
the
semblance
of
death
;
for
some
among
these
men
were
still
capable
of
dragging
themselves
up
to
him
,
and
by
concentrating
all
their
failing
energies
into
one
blow
,
put
him
to
a
speedy
end
.
  
<EOS>
The
outlying
pickets
of
the
French
army
were
within
easy
rifle
shot
;
and
his
uniform
,
although
less
conspicuous
in
colour
than
that
of
the
marines
,
by
whose
sides
he
had
been
fighting
,
would
make
him
a
sure
mark
if
he
so
much
as
moved
his
arm
.
<EOS>
Yet
how
he
longed
to
turn
,
if
ever
so
slightly
,
so
that
the
cruel
slanting
sun
might
not
beat
full
into
his
aching
eyes
.
<EOS>
Fever
,
too
,
was
coming
upon
him
;
the
pain
in
his
leg
was
every
moment
growing
more
severe
;
the
terrible
thirst
of
the
wounded
,
added
to
the
heat
and
fatigue
of
the
day
,
made
his
lips
and
tongue
feel
baked
and
dry
,
and
his
whole
throat
seemed
parched
and
wooden
.
<EOS>
Thoughts
of
other
days
,
of
cool
Greenland
seas
,
where
ice
abounded
,
of
grassy
English
homes
,
began
to
make
the
past
more
real
than
the
present
.
  
<EOS>
With
a
great
effort
he
brought
his
wandering
senses
back
;
he
knew
where
he
was
now
,
and
could
weigh
the
chances
of
his
life
,
which
were
but
small
;
the
unwonted
tears
came
to
his
eyes
as
he
thought
of
the
newly
-
made
wife
in
her
English
home
,
who
might
never
know
how
he
died
thinking
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
Suddenly
he
saw
a
party
of
English
marines
advance
,
under
shelter
of
the
ravelin
,
to
pick
up
the
wounded
,
and
bear
them
within
the
walls
for
surgical
help
.
<EOS>
They
were
so
near
he
could
see
their
faces
,
could
hear
them
speak
;
yet
he
durst
not
make
any
sign
to
them
when
he
lay
within
range
of
the
French
picket
's
fire
.
  
<EOS>
For
one
moment
he
could
not
resist
raising
his
head
,
to
give
himself
a
chance
for
life
;
before
the
unclean
creatures
that
infest
a
camp
came
round
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
to
strip
and
insult
the
dead
bodies
,
and
to
put
to
death
such
as
had
yet
the
breath
of
life
within
them
.
<EOS>
But
the
setting
sun
came
full
into
his
face
,
and
he
saw
nothing
of
what
he
longed
to
see
.
  
<EOS>
He
fell
back
in
despair
;
he
lay
there
to
die
.
  
<EOS>
That
strong
clear
sunbeam
had
wrought
his
salvation
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
been
recognized
as
men
are
recognized
when
they
stand
in
the
red
glare
of
a
house
on
fire
;
the
same
despair
of
help
,
of
hopeless
farewell
to
life
,
stamped
on
their
faces
in
blood
-
red
light
.
  
<EOS>
One
man
left
his
fellows
,
and
came
running
forwards
,
forwards
in
among
the
enemy
's
wounded
,
within
range
of
their
guns
;
he
bent
down
over
Kinraid
;
he
seemed
to
understand
without
a
word
;
he
lifted
him
up
,
carrying
him
like
a
child
;
and
with
the
vehement
energy
that
is
more
from
the
force
of
will
than
the
strength
of
body
,
he
bore
him
back
to
within
the
shelter
of
the
ravelin
 
not
without
many
shots
being
aimed
at
them
,
one
of
which
hit
Kinraid
in
the
fleshy
part
of
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
Kinraid
was
racked
with
agony
from
his
dangling
broken
leg
,
and
his
very
life
seemed
leaving
him
;
yet
he
remembered
afterwards
how
the
marine
recalled
his
fellows
,
and
how
,
in
the
pause
before
they
returned
,
his
face
became
like
one
formerly
known
to
the
sick
senses
of
Kinraid
;
yet
it
was
too
like
a
dream
,
too
utterly
improbable
to
be
real
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
the
few
words
this
man
said
,
as
he
stood
breathless
and
alone
by
the
fainting
Kinraid
,
fitted
in
well
with
the
belief
<EOS>
conjured
up
by
his
personal
appearance
.
<EOS>
He
panted
out
,
    
<EOS>
"
I
niver
thought
you
'd
ha
'
kept
true
to
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
And
then
the
others
came
up
;
and
while
they
were
making
a
sling
of
their
belts
,
Kinraid
fainted
utterly
away
,
and
the
next
time
that
he
was
fully
conscious
,
he
was
lying
in
his
berth
in
the
_
Tigre
_
,
with
the
ship
surgeon
setting
his
leg
.
<EOS>
After
that
he
was
too
feverish
for
several
days
to
collect
his
senses
.
<EOS>
When
he
could
first
remember
,
and
form
a
judgment
upon
his
recollections
,
he
called
the
man
especially
charged
to
attend
upon
him
,
and
bade
him
go
and
make
inquiry
in
every
possible
manner
for
a
marine
named
Philip
Hepburn
,
and
,
when
he
was
found
,
to
entreat
him
to
come
and
see
Kinraid
.
  
<EOS>
The
sailor
was
away
the
greater
part
of
the
day
,
and
returned
unsuccessful
in
his
search
;
he
had
been
from
ship
to
ship
,
hither
and
thither
;
he
had
questioned
all
the
marines
he
had
met
with
,
no
one
knew
anything
of
any
Philip
Hepburn
.
  
<EOS>
Kinraid
passed
a
miserably
feverish
night
,
and
when
the
doctor
exclaimed
the
next
morning
at
his
retrogression
,
he
told
him
,
with
some
irritation
,
of
the
ill
-
success
of
his
servant
;
he
accused
the
man
of
stupidity
,
and
wished
fervently
that
he
were
able
to
go
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Partly
to
soothe
him
,
the
doctor
promised
that
he
would
undertake
the
search
for
Hepburn
,
and
he
engaged
faithfully
to
follow
all
Kinraid
's
eager
directions
;
not
to
be
satisfied
with
men
's
careless
words
,
but
to
look
over
muster
-
rolls
and
ships
'
books
.
  
<EOS>
He
,
too
,
brought
the
same
answer
,
however
unwillingly
given
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
set
out
upon
the
search
so
confident
of
success
,
that
he
felt
doubly
discomfited
by
failure
.
<EOS>
However
,
he
had
persuaded
himself
that
the
lieutenant
had
been
partially
delirious
from
the
effects
of
his
wound
,
and
the
power
of
the
sun
shining
down
just
where
he
lay
.
<EOS>
There
had
,
indeed
,
been
slight
symptoms
of
Kinraid
's
having
received
a
sun
-
stroke
;
and
the
doctor
dwelt
largely
on
these
in
his
endeavour
to
persuade
his
patient
that
it
was
his
imagination
which
had
endued
a
stranger
with
the
lineaments
of
some
former
friend
.
  
<EOS>
Kinraid
threw
his
arms
out
of
bed
with
impatience
at
all
this
plausible
talk
,
which
was
even
more
irritating
than
the
fact
that
Hepburn
was
still
undiscovered
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
man
was
no
friend
of
mine
;
I
was
like
to
have
killed
him
when
last
I
saw
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
shopkeeper
in
a
country
town
in
England
.
<EOS>
I
had
seen
little
enough
of
him
;
but
enough
to
make
me
able
to
swear
to
him
anywhere
,
even
in
a
marine
's
uniform
,
and
in
this
sweltering
country
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Faces
once
seen
,
especially
in
excitement
,
are
apt
to
return
upon
the
memory
in
cases
of
fever
,
"
quoth
the
doctor
,
sententiously
.
  
<EOS>
The
attendant
sailor
,
reinstalled
to
some
complacency
by
the
failure
of
another
in
the
search
in
which
he
himself
had
been
unsuccessful
,
now
put
in
his
explanation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Maybe
it
was
a
spirit
.
<EOS>
It
's
not
th
'
first
time
as
I
've
heared
of
a
spirit
coming
upon
earth
to
save
a
man
's
life
<EOS>
i
'
time
o
'
need
.
<EOS>
My
father
had
an
uncle
,
a
west
-
country
grazier
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
-
coming
over
Dartmoor
in
Devonshire
one
moonlight
night
with
a
power
o
'
money
as
he
'd
got
for
his
sheep
at
t
'
fair
.
<EOS>
It
were
stowed
i
'
leather
bags
under
th
'
seat
o
'
th
'
gig
.
<EOS>
It
were
a
rough
kind
o
'
road
,
both
as
a
road
and
in
character
,
for
there
'd
been
many
robberies
there
of
late
,
and
th
'
great
rocks
stood
convenient
for
hiding
-
places
.
<EOS>
All
at
once
father
's
uncle
feels
as
if
some
one
were
sitting
beside
him
on
th
'
empty
seat
;
and
he
turns
his
head
and
looks
,
and
there
he
sees
his
brother
sitting
 
his
brother
as
had
been
dead
twelve
year
and
more
.
<EOS>
So
he
turns
his
head
back
again
,
eyes
right
,
and
never
say
a
word
,
but
wonders
what
it
all
means
.
<EOS>
All
of
a
sudden
two
fellows
come
out
upo
'
th
'
white
road
from
some
black
shadow
,
and
they
looked
,
and
they
let
th
'
gig
go
past
,
father
's
uncle
driving
hard
,
I
'll
warrant
him
.
<EOS>
But
for
all
that
he
heard
one
say
to
t
'
other
,
"
By
#
#
#
#
,
there
's
_
two
_
on
'
em
!
"
<EOS>
Straight
on
he
drove
faster
than
ever
,
till
he
saw
th
'
far
lights
of
some
town
or
other
.
<EOS>
I
forget
its
name
,
though
I
've
heared
it
many
a
time
;
and
then
he
drew
a
long
breath
,
and
turned
his
head
to
look
at
his
brother
,
and
ask
him
how
he
'd
managed
to
come
out
of
his
grave
<EOS>
i
'
Barum
churchyard
,
and
th
'
<EOS>
seat
was
as
empty
as
it
had
been
when
he
set
out
;
and
then
he
knew
that
it
were
a
spirit
come
to
help
him
against
th
'
men
who
thought
to
rob
him
,
and
would
likely
enough
ha
'
murdered
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Kinraid
had
kept
quiet
through
this
story
.
<EOS>
But
when
the
sailor
began
to
draw
the
moral
,
and
to
say
,
"
And
I
think
I
may
make
bold
to
say
,
sir
,
as
th
'
marine
who
carried
you
out
o
'
th
'
<EOS>
Frenchy
's
gun
-
shot
was
just
a
spirit
come
to
help
you
,
"
he
exclaimed
impatiently
,
swearing
a
great
oath
as
he
did
so
,
"
It
was
no
spirit
,
I
tell
you
;
and
I
was
in
my
full
senses
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
man
named
Philip
Hepburn
.
<EOS>
He
said
words
to
me
,
or
over
me
,
as
none
but
himself
would
have
said
.
<EOS>
Yet
we
hated
each
other
like
poison
;
and
I
ca
n't
make
out
why
he
should
be
there
and
putting
himself
in
danger
to
save
me
.
<EOS>
But
so
it
was
;
and
as
you
ca
n't
find
him
,
let
me
hear
no
more
of
your
nonsense
.
<EOS>
It
was
him
,
and
not
my
fancy
,
doctor
.
<EOS>
It
was
flesh
and
blood
,
and
not
a
spirit
,
Jack
.
<EOS>
So
get
along
with
you
,
and
leave
me
quiet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
All
this
time
Stephen
Freeman
lay
friendless
,
sick
,
and
shattered
,
on
board
the
_
Theseus
_
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
been
about
his
duty
close
to
some
shells
that
were
placed
on
her
deck
;
a
gay
young
midshipman
was
thoughtlessly
striving
to
get
the
fusee
out
of
one
of
these
by
a
mallet
and
spike
-
nail
that
lay
close
at
hand
;
and
a
fearful
explosion
ensued
,
in
which
the
poor
marine
,
cleaning
his
bayonet
near
,
was
shockingly
burnt
and
disfigured
,
the
very
skin
of
all
the
lower
part
of
his
face
being
utterly
destroyed
by
gunpowder
.
<EOS>
They
said
it
was
a
mercy
that
his
eyes
were
spared
;
but
he
could
hardly
feel
anything
to
be
a
mercy
,
as
he
lay
tossing
in
agony
,
burnt
by
the
explosion
,
wounded
by
splinters
,
and
feeling
that
he
was
disabled
for
life
,
if
life
itself
were
preserved
.
<EOS>
Of
all
that
suffered
by
that
fearful
accident
(
and
they
were
many
)
<EOS>
none
was
so
forsaken
,
so
hopeless
,
so
desolate
,
as
the
Philip
Hepburn
about
whom
such
anxious
inquiries
were
being
made
at
that
very
time
.
    
<EOS>
CONFIDENCES
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
little
later
on
in
that
same
summer
that
Mrs.
Brunton
came
to
visit
her
sister
Bessy
.
  
<EOS>
Bessy
was
married
to
a
tolerably
well
-
to
-
do
farmer
who
lived
at
an
almost
equal
distance
between
Monkshaven
and
Hartswell
;
but
from
old
habit
and
convenience
the
latter
was
regarded
as
the
Dawsons
'
market
-
town
;
so
Bessy
seldom
or
never
saw
her
old
friends
in
Monkshaven
.
  
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Brunton
was
far
too
flourishing
a
person
not
to
speak
out
her
wishes
,
and
have
her
own
way
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
notion
,
she
said
,
of
coming
such
a
long
journey
only
to
see
Bessy
and
her
husband
,
and
not
to
have
a
sight
of
her
former
acquaintances
at
Monkshaven
.
<EOS>
She
might
have
added
,
that
her
new
bonnet
and
cloak
would
be
as
good
as
lost
if
it
was
not
displayed
among
those
who
,
knowing
her
as
Molly
Corney
,
and
being
less
fortunate
in
matrimony
than
she
was
,
would
look
upon
it
with
wondering
admiration
,
if
not
with
envy
.
  
<EOS>
So
one
day
farmer
Dawson
's
market
-
cart
deposited
Mrs.
Brunton
in
all
her
bravery
at
the
shop
in
the
market
-
place
,
over
which
Hepburn
and
Coulson
's
names
still
flourished
in
joint
partnership
.
  
<EOS>
After
a
few
words
of
brisk
recognition
to
Coulson
and
Hester
,
Mrs
Brunton
passed
on
into
the
parlour
and
greeted
Sylvia
with
boisterous
heartiness
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
now
four
years
and
more
since
the
friends
had
met
;
and
each
secretly
wondered
how
they
had
ever
come
to
be
friends
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
had
a
country
,
raw
,
spiritless
look
to
Mrs.
Brunton
's
eye
;
Molly
was
loud
and
talkative
,
and
altogether
distasteful
to
Sylvia
,
trained
in
daily
companionship
with
Hester
to
appreciate
soft
slow
speech
,
and
grave
thoughtful
ways
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
they
kept
up
the
forms
of
their
old
friendship
,
though
their
hearts
had
drifted
far
apart
.
<EOS>
They
sat
hand
in
hand
while
each
looked
at
the
other
with
eyes
inquisitive
as
to
the
changes
which
time
had
made
.
<EOS>
Molly
was
the
first
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
to
be
sure
!
<EOS>
how
thin
and
pale
yo've

<EOS>
Matrimony

as
well
as
it

<EOS>
Brunton
is
allays
saying
(
yo

what
a

he
is
for

that
if

known

I
should

twice
<EOS>
afore

<EOS>
Why

I

<EOS>
thirty

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yo

do
look
brave
and
hearty

"
<EOS>
said
Sylvia
,
putting
her
sense
of
her
companion
's
capacious
size
and
high
colour
into
the
prettiest
words
she
could
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
!
Sylvia
!
<EOS>
but
I
know
what
it
is
,
"
said
Molly
,
shaking
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
just
because
o
'
that
husband
o
'
thine
as
has
gone
and
left
thee
;
thou
's
pining
after
him
,
and
he
's
not
worth
it

<EOS>
Brunton
said
,
when
he
heared
on
it
 
<EOS>
I
mind
he
was
smoking
at
t
'
time
,
and
he
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
,
and
shook
out
t
'
ashes
as
grave
as
any
judge
 
<EOS>
"
The
man
,
"
says
he
,
"
as
can
desert
a
wife
like
Sylvia
Robson
as
was
,
deserves
hanging

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
's
what
he
says
!
<EOS>
Eh

<EOS>
Sylvia
,
but
speakin

o

hanging
<EOS>
I
was
so
grieved
for

<EOS>
Such

<EOS>
Many

"
  
<EOS>
"
Please
do
n't
speak
on
it

"
<EOS>
said
Sylvia
,
trembling
all
over
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well

poor

I
wunnot

It

it

i

Hepburn
to

and
so
soon
after

was

talk
about

Many

twelve
cows
in
his
cow
-
house
,
beside
three
right
down
good
horses
;
and
Kinraid
were
allays
a
fellow
wi
'
two
strings
to
his
bow
.
<EOS>
I
've
allays
said
and
do
maintain
,
that
he
went
on
pretty
strong
wi
'
yo
'
,
Sylvie
;
and
I
will
say
I
think
he
cared
more
for
yo
'
than
for
our
Bessy
,
though
it
were
only
yesterday
at
e'en
she
were
standing
out
that
he
liked
her
better
than
yo
'
.
<EOS>
Yo'll
ha
'
heared
on
his
grand
marriage
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
said
Sylvia
,
with
eager
painful
curiosity
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
<EOS>
It
was
in
all
t
'
papers
!
<EOS>
I
wonder
as
yo
'
did
n't
see
it
.
<EOS>
Wait
a
minute
!
<EOS>
I
cut
it
out
o
<EOS>
'
t
'
_
Gentleman
's
Magazine
_
,
as
Brunton
bought
o
'
purpose
,
and
put
it
<EOS>
i
'
<EOS>
my
pocket
-
book
when
I
were
a
-
coming
here
<EOS>
:
I
know
I
've
got
it
somewheere
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
took
out
her
smart
crimson
pocket
-
book
,
and
rummaged
in
the
pocket
until
she
produced
a
little
crumpled
bit
of
printed
paper
,
from
which
she
read
aloud
,
  
<EOS>
"
On
January
the
third
,
at
St
Mary
Redcliffe
,
Bristol
,
Charles
Kinraid
,
Esq
.
,
<EOS>
lieutenant
Royal
Navy
,
to
Miss
Clarinda
Jackson
,
with
a
fortune
of
10,000_l
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Theere
!
"
said
she
,
triumphantly
,
"
it
's
something
as
Brunton
says
,
to
be
cousin
to
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Would
yo
'
let
me
see
it
?
"
said
Sylvia
,
timidly
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Brunton
graciously
consented
;
and
Sylvia
brought
her
newly
acquired
reading
-
knowledge
,
hitherto
principally
exercised
on
the
Old
Testament
,
to
bear
on
these
words
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
wonderful
in
them
,
nothing
that
she
might
not
have
expected
;
and
yet
the
surprise
turned
her
giddy
for
a
moment
or
two
.
<EOS>
She
never
thought
of
seeing
him
again
,
never
.
<EOS>
But
to
think
of
his
caring
for
another
woman
as
much
as
he
had
done
for
her
,
nay
,
perhaps
more
!
  
<EOS>
The
idea
was
irresistibly
forced
upon
her
that
Philip
would
not
have
acted
so
;
it
would
have
taken
long
years
before
he
could
have
been
induced
to
put
another
on
the
throne
she
had
once
occupied
.
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
seemed
to
recognize
the
real
nature
of
Philip
's
love
.
  
<EOS>
But
she
said
nothing
but
"
Thank
yo
'
,
"
when
she
gave
the
scrap
of
paper
back
to
Molly
Brunton
.
<EOS>
And
the
latter
continued
giving
her
information
about
Kinraid
's
marriage
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
were
down
in
t
'
west
,
Plymouth
or
somewheere
,
when
he
met
wi
'
her
.
<EOS>
She
's
no
feyther
;
he
'd
been
in
t
'
sugar
-
baking
business
;
but
from
what
Kinraid
wrote
to
old
Turner
,
th
'
uncle
as
brought
him
up
at
Cullercoats
,
she
's
had
t
'
best
of
edications
:
can
play
on
t
'
instrument
and
dance
t
'
shawl
dance
;
and
Kinraid
had
all
her
money
settled
on
her
,
though
she
said
she
'd
rayther
give
it
all
to
him
,
which
I
must
say
,
being
his
cousin
,
was
very
pretty
on
her
.
<EOS>
He
's
left
her
now
,
having
to
go
off
in
t
'
_
Tigre
_
,
as
is
his
ship
,
to
t
'
Mediterranean
seas
;
and
she
's
written
to
offer
to
come
and
see
old
Turner
,
and
make
friends
with
his
relations
,
and
Brunton
is
going
to
gi'e
me
<EOS>
a
crimson
satin
as
soon
as
we
know
for
certain
when
she
's
coming
,
for
we
're
sure
to
be
asked
out
to
Cullercoats
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
if
she
's
very
pretty
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Sylvia
,
faintly
,
in
the
first
pause
in
this
torrent
of
talk
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
she
's
a
perfect
beauty
,
as
I
understand
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
traveller
as
come
to
our
shop
as
had
been
at
York
,
and
knew
some
of
her
cousins
theere
that
were
in
t
'
grocery
line
 
<EOS>
her
mother
was
a
York
lady
 
<EOS>
and
they
said
she
was
just
a
picture
of
a
woman
,
and
iver
<EOS>
so
many
gentlemen
had
been
wantin
'
to
marry
her
,
but
she
just
waited
for
Charley
Kinraid
,
yo
'
see
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
hope
they
'll
be
happy
;
I
'm
sure
I
do
!
"
said
Sylvia
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
just
luck
.
<EOS>
Some
folks
is
happy
i
'
marriage
,
and
some
is
n't
.
<EOS>
It
's
just
luck
,
and
there
's
no
forecasting
it
.
<EOS>
Men
is
such
unaccountable
animals
,
there
's
no
prophesyin
'
upon
'em
.
<EOS>
Who
'd
ha
'
thought
of
yo'r
husband
,
him
as
was
so
slow
and
sure
 
steady
Philip
,
as
we
lasses
used
to
ca
'
him
 
makin
'
a
moonlight
flittin
'
,
and
leavin
'
yo
'
to
be
a
widow
bewitched
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
did
n't
go
at
night
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
taking
the
words
"
moonlight
flitting
"
in
their
literal
sense
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
Well
,
I
only
said
"
moonlight
flittin
'
"
just
because
it
come
uppermost
and
I
knowed
no
better
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
all
about
it
,
Sylvie
,
for
I
ca
n't
mak
'
it
out
from
what
Bessy
says
.
<EOS>
Had
he
and
yo
'
had
words
?
 
<EOS>
but
in
course
yo
'
had
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
this
moment
Hester
came
into
the
room
;
and
Sylvia
joyfully
availed
herself
of
the
pretext
for
breaking
off
the
conversation
that
had
reached
this
painful
and
awkward
point
.
<EOS>
She
detained
Hester
in
the
room
for
fear
lest
Mrs.
Brunton
should
repeat
her
inquiry
as
to
how
it
all
happened
that
Philip
had
gone
away
;
but
the
presence
of
a
third
person
seemed
as
though
it
would
be
but
little
restraint
upon
the
inquisitive
Molly
,
who
repeatedly
bore
down
upon
the
same
questions
till
she
nearly
drove
Sylvia
distracted
,
between
her
astonishment
at
the
news
of
Kinraid
's
marriage
;
her
wish
to
be
alone
and
quiet
,
so
as
to
realize
the
full
meaning
of
that
piece
of
intelligence
;
her
desire
to
retain
Hester
in
the
conversation
;
her
efforts
to
prevent
Molly
's
recurrence
to
the
circumstances
of
Philip
's
disappearance
,
and
the
longing
 
more
vehement
every
minute
 
for
her
visitor
to
go
away
and
leave
her
in
peace
.
<EOS>
She
became
so
disturbed
with
all
these
thoughts
and
feelings
that
she
hardly
knew
what
she
was
saying
,
and
assented
or
dissented
to
speeches
without
there
being
either
any
reason
or
truth
in
her
words
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Brunton
had
arranged
to
remain
with
Sylvia
while
the
horse
rested
,
and
had
no
compunction
about
the
length
of
her
visit
.
<EOS>
She
expected
to
be
asked
to
tea
,
as
Sylvia
found
out
at
last
,
and
this
she
felt
would
be
the
worst
of
all
,
as
Alice
Rose
was
not
one
to
tolerate
the
coarse
,
careless
talk
of
such
a
woman
as
Mrs.
Brunton
without
uplifting
her
voice
in
many
a
testimony
against
it
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
sate
holding
Hester
's
gown
tight
in
order
to
prevent
her
leaving
the
room
,
and
trying
to
arrange
her
little
plans
so
that
too
much
discordance
should
not
arise
to
the
surface
.
<EOS>
Just
then
the
door
opened
,
and
little
Bella
came
in
from
the
kitchen
in
all
the
pretty
,
sturdy
dignity
of
two
years
old
,
Alice
following
her
with
careful
steps
,
and
protecting
,
outstretched
arms
,
a
slow
smile
softening
the
sternness
of
her
grave
face
;
for
the
child
was
the
unconscious
darling
of
the
household
,
and
all
eyes
softened
into
love
as
they
looked
on
her
.
<EOS>
She
made
straight
for
her
mother
with
something
grasped
in
her
little
dimpled
fist
;
but
half
-
way
across
the
room
she
seemed
to
have
become
suddenly
aware
of
the
presence
of
a
stranger
,
and
she
stopped
short
,
fixing
her
serious
eyes
full
on
Mrs.
Brunton
,
as
if
to
take
in
her
appearance
,
nay
,
as
if
to
penetrate
down
into
her
very
real
self
,
and
then
,
stretching
out
her
disengaged
hand
,
the
baby
spoke
out
the
words
that
had
been
hovering
about
her
mother
's
lips
for
an
hour
past
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
away
!
"
<EOS>
said
Bella
,
decisively
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
perfect
love
!
"
said
Mrs.
Brunton
,
half
in
real
admiration
,
half
in
patronage
.
<EOS>
As
she
spoke
,
she
got
up
and
went
towards
the
child
,
as
if
to
take
her
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
away
!
<EOS>
do
away
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Bella
,
in
shrill
affright
at
this
movement
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dunnot
,
"
said
Sylvia
;
<EOS>
"
she
's
shy
;
she
does
n't
know
strangers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Brunton
had
grasped
the
struggling
,
kicking
child
by
this
time
,
and
her
reward
for
this
was
a
vehement
little
slap
in
the
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yo
'
naughty
little
spoilt
thing
!
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
setting
Bella
down
in
a
hurry
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yo
'
deserve
a
good
whipping
,
yo
'
do
,
and
<EOS>
if
yo
'
were
mine
yo
'
should
have
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
had
no
need
to
stand
up
for
the
baby
who
had
run
to
her
arms
,
and
was
soothing
herself
with
sobbing
on
her
mother
's
breast
;
for
Alice
took
up
the
defence
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
child
said
,
as
plain
as
words
could
say
,
"
go
away
,
"
and
if
thou
wouldst
follow
thine
own
will
instead
of
heeding
her
wish
,
thou
mun
put
up
with
the
wilfulness
of
the
old
Adam
,
of
which
it
seems
to
me
thee
hast
getten
thy
share
at
thirty
as
well
as
little
Bella
at
two
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thirty
!
"
said
Mrs.
Brunton
,
now
fairly
affronted
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Thirty
!
<EOS>
why
,
Sylvia
,
yo
'
know
<EOS>
I
'm
but
two
years
older
than
yo
'
<EOS>
;
speak
to
that
woman
an
'
tell
her
as
I
'm
only
four
-
and
-
twenty
.
<EOS>
Thirty
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Molly
's
but
four
-
and
-
twenty
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
in
a
pacificatory
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Whether
she
be
twenty
,
or
thirty
,
or
forty
,
is
alike
to
me
,
"
said
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
I
meant
no
harm
.
<EOS>
I
meant
but
for
t
'
say
as
her
angry
words
to
the
child
bespoke
her
to
be
one
of
the
foolish
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
who
she
is
,
nor
what
her
age
may
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
an
old
friend
of
mine
,
"
said
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
"
She
's
Mrs.
Brunton
now
,
but
when
I
knowed
her
she
was
Molly
Corney
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
<EOS>
and
yo
'
were
Sylvia
Robson
,
and
as
bonny
and
light
-
hearted
a
lass
as
any
in
a
'
t
'
Riding
,
though
now
yo're
a
poor
widow
bewitched
,
left
wi

a
child
as
I
must
n't
speak
a
word
about

folk
as
talk
about
t
'
old
Adam
as
if
he
was
n't
dead
and
done
wi
'
long
ago
!
<EOS>
It
's
a
change
,
Sylvia
,
as
makes
my
heart
ache
for
yo
'
,
to
think
on
them
old
days
when
yo
'
were
so
thought
on

might
have
had

<EOS>
as
Brunton
often
says
;
it
were
a
great
mistake
as
yo

iver
took
up
wi
'
yon
man
as
has
run
away

<EOS>
But
seven
year
'll
soon
be
past
fro
'
t
'
time
he
went
off
,
and
yo'll
only
be
six
-
and
-
twenty
then
;
and
there
'll
be
a
chance
of
a
better
husband
for
yo
'
after
all
,
so
keep
up
yo'r
heart
,
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Molly
Brunton
had
put
as
much
venom
as
she
knew
how
into
this
speech
,
meaning
it
as
a
vengeful
payment
for
the
supposition
of
her
being
thirty
,
even
more
than
for
the
reproof
for
her
angry
words
about
the
child
.
<EOS>
She
thought
that
Alice
Rose
must
be
either
mother
or
aunt
to
Philip
,
from
the
serious
cast
of
countenance
that
was
remarkable
in
both
;
and
she
rather
exulted
in
the
allusion
to
a
happier
second
marriage
for
Sylvia
,
with
which
she
had
concluded
her
speech
.
<EOS>
It
roused
Alice
,
however
,
as
effectually
as
if
she
had
been
really
a
blood
relation
to
Philip
;
but
for
a
different
reason
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
slow
to
detect
the
intentional
offensiveness
to
herself
in
what
had
been
said
;
she
was
indignant
at
Sylvia
for
suffering
the
words
spoken
to
pass
unanswered
;
but
in
truth
they
were
too
much
in
keeping
with
Molly
Brunton
's
character
to
make
as
much
impression
on
Sylvia
as
they
did
on
a
stranger
;
and
besides
,
she
felt
as
if
the
less
reply
Molly
received
,
the
less
likely
would
it
be
that
she
would
go
on
in
the
same
strain
.
<EOS>
So
she
coaxed
and
chattered
to
her
child
and
behaved
like
a
little
coward
in
trying
to
draw
out
of
the
conversation
,
while
at
the
same
time
listening
attentively
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
for
Sylvia
Hepburn
as
was
Sylvia
Robson
<EOS>
,
she
knows
my
mind
,
"
said
Alice
,
in
grim
indignation
.
<EOS>
"
She
's
humbling
herself
now
,
I
trust
and
pray
,
but
she
was
light
-
minded
and
full
of
vanity
when
Philip
married
her
,
and
it
might
ha
'
been
a
lift
towards
her
salvation
in
one
way
;
but
it
pleased
the
Lord
to
work
in
a
different
way
,
and
she
mun
wear
her
sackcloth
and
ashes
in
patience
.
<EOS>
So
I
'll
say
naught
more
about
her
.
<EOS>
But
for
him
as
is
absent
,
as
thee
hast
spoken
on
so
lightly
and
reproachfully
,
I
'd
have
thee
to
know
he
were
one
of
a
different
kind
to
any
thee
<EOS>
ever
knew
,
I
reckon
.
<EOS>
If
he
were
led
away
by
a
pretty
face
to
slight
one
as
was
fitter
for
him
,
and
who
had
loved
him
as
the
apple
of
her
eye
,
it
's
him
as
is
suffering
for
it
,
inasmuch
as
he
's
a
wanderer
from
his
home
,
and
an
outcast
from
wife
and
child
.
"
  
<EOS>
To
the
surprise
of
all
,
Molly
's
words
of
reply
were
cut
short
even
when
they
were
on
her
lips
,
by
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
Pale
,
fire
-
eyed
,
and
excited
,
with
Philip
's
child
on
one
arm
,
and
the
other
stretched
out
,
she
said
,
    
"
Noane
can
tell
 
noane
know
.
<EOS>
No
one
shall
speak
a
judgment
'
twixt
Philip
and
me
.
<EOS>
He
acted
cruel
and
wrong
by
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
've
said
my
words
to
him
hissel
'
,
and
I
'm
noane
going
to
make
any
plaint
to
others
;
only
them
as
knows
should
judge
.
<EOS>
And
it
's
not
fitting
,
it
's
not
'
(
almost
sobbing
)
,
"
to
go
on
wi
'
talk
like
this
afore
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
two
 
for
Hester
,
who
was
aware
that
her
presence
had
only
been
desired
by
Sylvia
as
a
check
to
an
unpleasant
_
tete
-
a
-
tete
_
conversation
,
had
slipped
back
to
her
business
as
soon
as
her
mother
came
in
 
the
two
looked
with
surprise
at
Sylvia
;
her
words
,
her
whole
manner
,
belonged
to
a
phase
of
her
character
which
seldom
came
uppermost
,
and
which
had
not
been
perceived
by
either
of
them
before
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
Rose
,
though
astonished
,
rather
approved
of
Sylvia
's
speech
;
it
showed
that
she
had
more
serious
thought
and
feeling
on
the
subject
than
the
old
woman
had
given
her
credit
for
;
her
general
silence
respecting
her
husband
's
disappearance
had
led
Alice
to
think
that
she
was
too
childish
to
have
received
any
deep
impression
from
the
event
.
<EOS>
Molly
Brunton
gave
vent
to
her
opinion
on
Sylvia
's
speech
in
the
following
words
:
    
"
Hoighty
-
toighty
!
<EOS>
That
tells
tales
,
lass
.
<EOS>
If
yo
'
treated
steady
Philip
to
many
such
looks
an
'
speeches
as
yo'n
given
us
now
,
it
's
<EOS>
easy
t
'
see
why
he
took
hisself
off
.
<EOS>
Why
,
Sylvia
,
I
niver
saw
it
in
yo
'
when
yo
'
was
a
girl
;
yo're
grown
into
a
regular
little
vixen
,
theere
wheere
yo
'
stand
!
"
  
<EOS>
Indeed
she
did
look
defiant
,
with
the
swift
colour
flushing
her
cheeks
to
crimson
on
its
return
,
and
the
fire
in
her
eyes
not
yet
died
away
.
<EOS>
But
at
Molly
's
jesting
words
she
sank
back
into
her
usual
look
and
manner
,
only
saying
quietly
,
    
<EOS>
"
It
's
for
noane
to
say
whether
I
'm
vixen
or
not
,
as
does
n't
know
th
'
past
things
as
is
buried
in
my
heart
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
not
hold
them
as
my
friends
as
go
on
talking
on
either
my
husband
or
me
before
my
very
face
.
<EOS>
What
he
was
,
I
know
;
and
what
I
am
,
I
reckon
he
knows
.
<EOS>
And
now
I
'll
go
hurry
tea
,
for
yo'll
be
needing
it
,
Molly
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
last
clause
of
this
speech
was
meant
to
make
peace
;
but
Molly
was
in
twenty
minds
as
to
whether
she
should
accept
the
olive
-
branch
or
not
.
<EOS>
Her
temper
,
however
,
was
of
that
obtuse
kind
which
is
not
easily
ruffled
;
her
mind
,
stagnant
in
itself
,
enjoyed
excitement
from
without
;
and
her
appetite
was
invariably
good
,
so
she
stayed
,
in
spite
of
the
inevitable
_
tete
-
a
-
tete
_
with
Alice
.
<EOS>
The
latter
,
however
,
refused
to
be
drawn
into
conversation
again
;
replying
to
Mrs.
Brunton
's
speeches
with
a
curt
<EOS>
yes
<EOS>
or
no
,
when
,
indeed
,
she
replied
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
When
all
were
gathered
at
tea
,
Sylvia
was
quite
calm
again
;
rather
paler
than
usual
,
and
very
attentive
and
subduced
in
her
behaviour
to
Alice
;
she
would
evidently
fain
have
been
silent
,
but
as
Molly
was
her
own
especial
guest
,
that
could
not
be
,
so
all
her
endeavours
went
towards
steering
the
conversation
away
from
any
awkward
points
.
<EOS>
But
each
of
the
four
,
let
alone
little
Bella
,
was
thankful
when
the
market
-
cart
drew
up
at
the
shop
door
,
<EOS>
that
was
to
take
Mrs.
Brunton
back
to
her
sister
's
house
.
  
<EOS>
When
she
was
fairly
off
,
Alice
Rose
opened
her
mouth
in
strong
condemnation
;
winding
up
with
    
"
<EOS>
And
if
aught
in
my
words
gave
thee
cause
for
offence
,
Sylvia
,
it
was
because
my
heart
rose
within
me
at
the
kind
of
talk
thee
and
she
had
been
having
about
Philip
;
and
her
evil
and
light
-
minded
counsel
to
thee
about
waiting
seven
years
,
and
then
wedding
another
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hard
as
these
words
may
seem
<EOS>
when
repeated
,
there
was
something
of
a
nearer
approach
to
an
apology
in
Mrs.
Rose
's
manner
than
Sylvia
had
ever
seen
in
it
before
.
<EOS>
She
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
<EOS>
,
then
she
said
,
    
"
I
ha
'
often
thought
of
telling
yo
'
and
Hester
,
special
-
like
,
when
yo've
been
so
kind
to
my
little
Bella
,
that
Philip
an
'
me
could
niver
come
together
again
;
no
,
not
if
he
came
home
this
very
night
   
<EOS>
'
  
<EOS>
She
would
have
gone
on
speaking
,
but
Hester
interrupted
her
with
a
low
cry
of
dismay
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
said
,
    
"
Hush
thee
,
Hester
.
<EOS>
It
's
no
business
o
'
thine
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
Hepburn
,
thou'rt
speaking
like
a
silly
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
I
'm
speaking
like
a
woman
;
like
a
woman
as
finds
out
she
's
been
cheated
by
men
as
she
trusted
,
and
as
has
no
help
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
'm
noane
going
to
say
any
more
about
it
.
<EOS>
It
's
me
as
has
been
wronged
,
and
as
has
to
bear
it
:
only
I
thought
I
'd
tell
yo
'
both
this
much
,
that
yo
'
might
know
somewhat
why
he
went
away
,
and
how
I
said
my
last
word
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
indeed
it
seemed
.
<EOS>
To
all
questions
and
remonstrances
from
Alice
,
Sylvia
turned
a
deaf
ear
.
<EOS>
She
averted
her
face
from
Hester
's
sad
,
wistful
looks
;
only
when
they
were
parting
for
the
night
,
at
the
top
of
the
little
staircase
,
she
turned
,
and
putting
her
arms
round
<EOS>
Hester
's
neck
<EOS>
she
laid
her
head
on
her
neck
,
and
whispered
,
    
"
Poor
Hester
 
poor
,
poor
Hester
!
<EOS>
if
yo
'
an
'
he
had
but
been
married
together
,
what
a
deal
o
'
sorrow
would
ha
'
been
spared
to
us
all
!
"
  
<EOS>
Hester
pushed
her
away
as
she
finished
these
words
;
looked
searchingly
into
her
face
,
her
eyes
,
and
then
followed
Sylvia
into
her
room
,
where
Bella
lay
sleeping
,
shut
the
door
,
and
almost
knelt
down
at
Sylvia
's
feet
,
clasping
her
,
and
hiding
her
face
in
the
folds
of
the
other
's
gown
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sylvia
,
Sylvia
,
"
she
murmured
,
"
some
one
has
told
you
 
I
thought
no
one
knew
 
<EOS>
it
's
no
sin
 
<EOS>
it
's
done
away
with
now
 
<EOS>
indeed
it
is
 
<EOS>
it
was
long
ago
 
before
yo
'
were
married
;
but
I
can
not
forget
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
shame
,
perhaps
,
to
have
thought
on
it
iver
,
when
he
niver
thought
o
'
me
;
but
I
niver
believed
as
any
one
<EOS>
could
ha
'
found
it
out
.
<EOS>
I
'm
just
fit
to
sink
into
t
'
ground
,
<EOS>
what
wi
'
my
sorrow
and
my
shame
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hester
was
stopped
by
her
own
rising
sobs
,
immediately
she
was
in
Sylvia
's
arms
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
was
sitting
on
the
ground
holding
her
,
and
soothing
her
with
caresses
and
broken
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
allays
saying
t
'
wrong
things
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
seems
as
if
I
were
all
upset
to
-
day
;
and
indeed
I
am
;
"
she
added
,
alluding
to
the
news
of
Kinraid
's
marriage
she
had
yet
to
think
upon
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
was
n't
yo
'
,
<EOS>
Hester
:
it
were
nothing
<EOS>
yo
'
iver
said
,
or
did
,
or
looked
,
for
that
matter
.
<EOS>
It
were
yo'r
mother
as
let
it
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
mother
!
<EOS>
mother
!
<EOS>
"
wailed
out
Hester
;
"
I
niver
thought
as
any
one
but
God
would
ha
'
known
that
I
had
iver
for
a
day
thought
on
his
being
more
to
me
than
a
brother
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
made
no
reply
,
only
went
on
stroking
Hester
's
smooth
brown
hair
,
off
which
her
cap
had
fallen
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
was
thinking
how
strange
life
was
,
and
how
love
seemed
to
go
all
at
cross
purposes
;
and
was
losing
herself
in
bewilderment
at
the
mystery
of
the
world
;
she
was
almost
startled
when
Hester
rose
up
,
and
taking
Sylvia
's
hands
in
both
of
hers
,
and
looking
solemnly
at
her
,
said
,
    
"
Sylvia
,
yo
'
know
what
has
been
my
trouble
and
my
shame
,
and
I
'm
sure
yo're
sorry
for
me
 
for
I
will
humble
myself
to
yo
'
,
and
own
that
for
many
months
before
yo
'
were
married
,
I
felt
my
disappointment
like
a
heavy
burden
laid
on
me
by
day
and
by
night
;
but
now
I
ask
yo
'
,
if
yo've
any
pity
for
me
for
what
I
went
through
,
or
if
yo've
any
love
for
me
because
of
yo'r
<EOS>
dead
mother
's
love
for
me
,
or
because
of
any
fellowship
,
or
daily
breadliness
between
us
two
,
 
put
the
hard
thoughts
of
Philip
away
from
out
yo'r
heart
;
he
may
ha
'
done
yo
'
<EOS>
wrong
,
anyway
yo
'
think
that
he
has
;
I
niver
knew
him
aught
but
kind
and
good
;
but
if
he
comes
back
from
wheriver
in
th
'
wide
world
he
's
gone
to
(
<EOS>
and
there
's
not
a
night
<EOS>
but
I
pray
God
to
keep
him
,
and
send
him
safe
back
)
,
yo
'
put
away
the
memory
of
past
injury
,
and
forgive
it
all
,
and
be
,
what
yo
'
can
be
,
Sylvia
,
if
you
've
a
mind
to
,
just
the
kind
,
good
wife
he
ought
to
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
;
yo
'
know
nothing
about
it
,
Hester
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
,
then
,
"
pleaded
Hester
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
said
Sylvia
,
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
;
"
I
'd
do
a
deal
for
yo
'
,
<EOS>
I
would
,
but
I
dare
n't
forgive
Philip
,
even
if
I
could
;
I
took
a
great
oath
again
'
him
.
<EOS>
Ay
,
yo
'
may
look
shocked
at
me
,
but
it
's
him
as
yo
'
ought
for
to
be
shocked
at
if
yo
'
knew
all
.
<EOS>
I
said
I
'd
niver
forgive
him
;
I
shall
keep
to
my
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
'd
better
pray
for
his
death
,
then
,
"
said
Hester
,
hopelessly
,
and
almost
bitterly
,
loosing
her
hold
of
Sylvia
's
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
it
were
n't
for
baby
theere
,
I
could
think
as
it
were
my
death
as
'
ud
be
best
.
<EOS>
Them
as
one
thinks
t
'
most
on
,
forgets
one
soonest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
Kinraid
to
whom
she
was
alluding
;
but
Hester
did
not
understand
her
;
and
after
standing
for
a
moment
in
silence
,
she
kissed
her
,
and
left
her
for
the
night
.
    
<EOS>
AN
UNEXPECTED
MESSENGER
  
<EOS>
After
this
agitation
,
and
these
partial
confidences
,
no
more
was
said
on
the
subject
of
Philip
for
many
weeks
.
<EOS>
They
avoided
even
the
slightest
allusion
to
him
;
and
none
of
them
knew
how
seldom
or
how
often
he
might
be
present
in
the
minds
of
the
others
.
  
<EOS>
One
day
the
little
Bella
was
unusually
fractious
with
some
slight
childish
indisposition
,
and
Sylvia
was
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
a
never
-
failing
piece
of
amusement
;
namely
,
to
take
the
child
into
the
shop
,
when
the
number
of
new
,
bright
-
coloured
articles
was
sure
to
beguile
the
little
girl
out
of
her
fretfulness
.
<EOS>
She
was
walking
along
the
high
terrace
of
the
counter
,
kept
steady
by
her
mother
's
hand
,
when
Mr.
Dawson
's
market
-
cart
once
more
stopped
before
the
door
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
Mrs.
Brunton
who
alighted
now
;
it
was
a
very
smartly
-
dressed
,
very
pretty
young
lady
,
who
put
one
dainty
foot
before
the
other
with
care
,
as
if
descending
from
such
a
primitive
vehicle
were
a
new
occurrence
in
her
life
.
<EOS>
Then
she
looked
up
at
the
names
above
the
shop
-
door
,
and
after
ascertaining
that
this
was
indeed
the
place
she
desired
to
find
,
she
came
in
blushing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
Mrs.
Hepburn
at
home
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
of
Hester
,
whose
position
in
the
shop
brought
her
forwards
to
receive
the
customers
,
while
Sylvia
drew
Bella
out
of
sight
behind
some
great
bales
of
red
flannel
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
I
see
her
?
"
<EOS>
the
sweet
,
south
-
country
voice
went
on
,
still
addressing
Hester
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
heard
the
inquiry
,
and
came
forwards
,
with
a
little
rustic
awkwardness
,
feeling
both
shy
and
curious
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
yo
'
please
walk
this
way
,
ma'am
?
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
leading
her
visitor
back
into
her
own
dominion
of
the
parlour
,
and
leaving
Bella
to
Hester
's
willing
care
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
me
!
"
said
the
pretty
young
lady
,
joyously
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
think
you
knew
my
husband
.
<EOS>
I
am
Mrs.
Kinraid
!
"
  
<EOS>
A
sob
of
surprise
rose
to
Sylvia
's
lips
 
she
choked
it
down
,
however
,
and
tried
to
conceal
any
emotion
she
might
feel
,
in
placing
a
chair
for
her
visitor
,
and
trying
to
make
her
feel
welcome
,
although
,
if
the
truth
must
be
told
,
Sylvia
was
wondering
all
the
time
why
her
visitor
came
,
and
how
soon
she
would
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
knew
Captain
Kinraid
,
did
you
not
?
"
said
the
young
lady
,
with
innocent
inquiry
;
to
which
Sylvia
's
lips
formed
the
answer
,
"
Yes
,
"
but
no
clear
sound
issued
therefrom
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
I
know
your
husband
knew
the
captain
;
is
he
at
home
yet
?
<EOS>
Can
I
speak
to
him
?
<EOS>
I
do
so
want
to
see
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
was
utterly
bewildered
;
Mrs.
Kinraid
,
this
pretty
,
joyous
,
prosperous
little
bird
of
a
woman
,
Philip
,
Charley
's
wife
,
what
could
they
have
in
common
?
<EOS>
what
could
they
know
of
each
other
?
<EOS>
All
she
could
say
in
answer
to
Mrs.
Kinraid
's
eager
questions
,
and
still
more
eager
looks
,
was
,
that
her
husband
was
from
home
,
had
been
long
from
home
:
she
did
not
know
where
he
was
,
she
did
not
know
when
he
would
come
back
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Kinraid
's
face
fell
a
little
,
partly
from
her
own
real
disappointment
,
partly
out
of
sympathy
with
the
hopeless
,
indifferent
tone
of
Sylvia
's
replies
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Dawson
told
me
he
had
gone
away
rather
suddenly
a
year
ago
,
but
I
thought
he
might
be
come
home
by
now
.
<EOS>
I
am
expecting
the
captain
early
next
month
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
how
I
should
have
liked
to
see
Mr.
Hepburn
,
and
to
thank
him
for
saving
the
captain
's
life
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
yo
'
mean
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Sylvia
,
stirred
out
of
all
assumed
indifference
.
"
<EOS>
The
captain
!
<EOS>
is
that
"
(
not
"
Charley
"
<EOS>
,
she
could
not
use
that
familiar
name
to
the
pretty
young
wife
before
her
)
"
<EOS>
yo'r
husband
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
you
knew
him
,
did
n't
you
?
<EOS>
when
he
used
to
be
staying
with
Mr
Corney
,
his
uncle
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
knew
him
;
but
I
do
n't
understand
.
<EOS>
Will
yo
'
please
to
tell
me
all
about
it
,
ma'am
?
"
said
Sylvia
,
faintly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
your
husband
would
have
told
you
all
about
it
;
I
hardly
know
where
to
begin
.
<EOS>
You
know
my
husband
is
a
sailor
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
nodded
assent
,
listening
greedily
,
her
heart
beating
thick
all
the
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
's
now
a
Commander
in
the
Royal
Navy
,
all
earned
by
his
own
bravery
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
am
so
proud
of
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
So
could
Sylvia
have
been
if
she
had
been
his
wife
<EOS>
;
as
it
was
,
she
thought
how
often
she
had
felt
sure
that
he
would
be
a
great
man
some
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
has
been
at
the
siege
of
Acre
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
looked
perplexed
at
these
strange
words
,
and
Mrs.
Kinraid
caught
the
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
St
Jean
d'Acre
,
you
know
 
<EOS>
though
it
's
fine
saying
"
you
know
"
,
when
I
did
n't
know
a
bit
about
it
myself
till
the
captain
's
ship
was
ordered
there
,
though
I
was
the
head
girl
at
Miss
Dobbin
's
in
the
geography
class
 
<EOS>
Acre
is
a
seaport
town
,
not
far
from
Jaffa
,
which
is
the
modern
name
for
Joppa
,
where
St
Paul
went
to
long
ago
;
you
've
read
of
that
,
I
'm
sure
,
and
Mount
Carmel
,
where
the
prophet
Elijah
was
once
,
all
in
Palestine
,
you
know
,
only
the
Turks
have
got
it
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
n't
understand
yet
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
plaintively
;
<EOS>
"
I
daresay
it
's
all
very
true
about
St
Paul
,
but
please
,
ma'am
,
will
yo
'
tell
me
about
yo'r
husband
and
mine
 
have
they
met
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
at
Acre
,
I
tell
you
,
"
said
Mrs.
Kinraid
,
with
pretty
petulance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Turks
held
the
town
,
and
the
French
wanted
to
take
it
;
and
we
,
that
is
the
British
Fleet
,
would
n't
let
them
.
<EOS>
So
Sir
Sidney
Smith
,
a
commodore
and
a
great
friend
of
the
captain
's
,
landed
in
order
to
fight
the
French
;
and
the
captain
and
many
of
the
sailors
landed
with
him
;
and
it
was
burning
hot
;
and
the
poor
captain
was
wounded
,
and
lay
a
-
dying
of
pain
and
thirst
within
the
enemy
's
 
that
is
the
French
 
fire
;
so
that
they
were
ready
to
shoot
any
one
of
his
own
side
who
came
near
him
.
<EOS>
They
thought
he
was
dead
himself
,
you
see
,
as
he
was
very
near
;
and
would
have
been
too
,
if
your
husband
had
not
come
out
of
shelter
,
and
taken
him
up
in
his
arms
or
on
his
back
<EOS>
(
I
could
n't
make
out
which
)
,
and
carried
him
safe
within
the
walls
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
could
n't
have
been
Philip
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
dubiously
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
was
.
<EOS>
The
captain
says
so
;
and
he
's
not
a
man
to
be
mistaken
.
<EOS>
I
thought
I
'd
got
his
letter
with
me
;
and
I
would
have
read
you
a
part
of
it
,
but
I
left
it
at
Mrs.
Dawson
's
in
my
desk
;
and
I
ca
n't
send
it
to
you
,
"
blushing
as
she
remembered
certain
passages
in
which
"
the
captain
"
wrote
very
much
like
a
lover
,
"
or
else
I
would
.
<EOS>
But
you
may
be
quite
sure
it
was
your
husband
that
ventured
into
all
that
danger
to
save
his
old
friend
's
life
,
or
the
captain
would
not
have
said
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
they
were
n't
 
<EOS>
they
were
n't
 
not
to
call
great
friends
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
'd
got
the
letter
here
;
I
ca
n't
think
how
I
could
be
so
stupid
;
I
think
I
can
almost
remember
the
very
words
,
though
 
I
've
read
them
over
so
often
.
<EOS>
He
says
,
"
Just
as
I
gave
up
all
hope
,
I
saw
one
Philip
Hepburn
,
a
man
whom
I
had
known
at
Monkshaven
,
and
whom
I
had
some
reason
to
remember
well
"
 
<EOS>
(
I
'm
sure
he
says
<EOS>
so
 
"
remember
well
"
)
,
"
he
saw
me
too
,
and
came
at
the
risk
of
his
life
to
where
I
lay
.
<EOS>
I
fully
expected
he
would
be
shot
down
;
and
I
shut
my
eyes
not
to
see
the
end
of
my
last
chance
.
<EOS>
The
shot
rained
about
him
,
and
I
think
he
was
hit
;
but
he
took
me
up
and
carried
me
under
cover
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
he
says
that
,
I
've
read
it
over
so
often
;
and
he
goes
on
and
says
how
he
hunted
for
Mr.
Hepburn
all
through
the
ships
,
as
soon
as
ever
he
could
;
but
he
could
hear
nothing
of
him
,
either
alive
or
dead
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
go
so
white
,
for
pity
's
sake
!
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
suddenly
startled
by
Sylvia
's
blanching
colour
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
see
,
because
he
could
n't
find
him
alive
is
no
reason
for
giving
him
up
as
dead
;
because
his
name
was
n't
to
be
found
on
any
of
the
ships
'
books
;
so
the
captain
thinks
he
must
have
been
known
by
a
different
name
to
his
real
one
.
<EOS>
Only
he
says
he
should
like
to
have
seen
him
to
have
thanked
him
;
and
he
says
he
would
give
a
deal
to
know
what
has
become
of
him
;
and
as
I
was
staying
two
days
at
Mrs.
Dawson
's
,
I
told
them
I
must
come
over
to
Monkshaven
,
if
only
for
five
minutes
,
just
to
hear
if
your
good
husband
was
come
home
,
and
to
shake
his
hands
,
that
helped
to
save
my
own
dear
captain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
it
could
have
been
Philip
,
"
reiterated
Sylvia
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
asked
her
visitor
;
"
you
say
you
do
n't
know
where
he
is
;
why
might
n't
he
have
been
there
where
the
captain
says
he
was
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
was
n't
a
sailor
,
nor
yet
a
soldier
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
but
he
was
.
<EOS>
I
think
somewhere
the
captain
calls
him
a
marine
;
that
's
neither
one
nor
the
other
,
but
a
little
of
both
.
<EOS>
He
'll
be
coming
home
some
day
soon
;
and
then
you
'll
see
!
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
Rose
came
in
at
this
minute
,
and
Mrs.
Kinraid
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
she
was
Sylvia
's
mother
,
and
in
her
overflowing
gratitude
and
friendliness
to
all
the
family
of
him
who
had
"
saved
the
captain
"
she
went
forward
,
and
shook
the
old
woman
's
hand
in
that
pleasant
confiding
way
that
wins
all
hearts
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
's
your
daughter
,
ma'am
!
"
said
she
to
the
half
-
astonished
,
half
-
pleased
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
Mrs.
Kinraid
,
the
wife
of
the
captain
that
used
to
be
in
these
parts
,
and
I
'm
come
to
bring
her
news
of
her
husband
,
and
she
do
n't
half
believe
me
,
though
it
's
all
to
his
credit
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
looked
so
perplexed
that
Sylvia
felt
herself
bound
to
explain
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
says
he
's
either
a
soldier
or
a
sailor
,
and
a
long
way
off
at
some
place
named
in
t
'
Bible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Philip
Hepburn
led
away
to
be
a
soldier
!
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
"
who
had
once
been
a
Quaker
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
a
very
brave
one
too
,
and
one
that
it
would
do
my
heart
good
to
look
upon
,
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Kinraid
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
been
saving
my
husband
's
life
in
the
Holy
Land
,
where
Jerusalem
is
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
!
"
said
Alice
,
a
little
scornfully
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
forgive
Sylvia
for
not
being
over
keen
to
credit
thy
news
.
<EOS>
Her
man
of
peace
becoming
a
man
of
war
;
and
suffered
to
enter
Jerusalem
,
which
is
a
heavenly
and
a
typical
city
at
this
time
;
while
me
,
as
is
one
of
the
elect
,
is
obliged
to
go
on
dwelling
in
Monkshaven
,
just
like
any
other
body
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
but
,
"
said
Mrs.
Kinraid
,
gently
,
seeing
she
was
touching
on
delicate
ground
<EOS>
,
"
I
did
not
say
he
had
gone
to
Jerusalem
,
but
my
husband
saw
him
in
those
parts
,
and
he
was
doing
his
duty
like
a
brave
,
good
man
;
ay
,
and
more
than
his
duty
;
and
,
you
may
take
my
word
for
it
<EOS>
,
he
'll
be
at
home
some
day
soon
,
and
all
I
beg
is
that
you
'll
let
the
captain
and
me
know
,
for
I
'm
sure
if
we
can
,
we
'll
both
come
and
pay
our
respects
to
him
.
<EOS>
And
I
'm
very
glad
I
've
seen
you
,
"
said
she
,
rising
to
go
,
and
putting
out
her
hand
to
shake
that
of
Sylvia
;
"
for
,
besides
being
Hepburn
's
wife
,
I
'm
pretty
sure
I
've
heard
the
captain
speak
of
you
;
and
if
ever
you
come
to
Bristol
<EOS>
I
hope
you
'll
come
and
see
us
on
Clifton
Downs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
went
away
,
leaving
Sylvia
almost
stunned
by
the
new
ideas
presented
to
her
.
<EOS>
Philip
a
soldier
!
<EOS>
Philip
in
a
battle
,
risking
his
life
.
<EOS>
Most
strange
of
all
,
Charley
and
Philip
once
more
meeting
together
,
not
as
rivals
or
as
foes
,
but
as
saviour
and
saved
!
<EOS>
Add
to
all
this
the
conviction
,
strengthened
by
every
word
that
happy
,
loving
wife
had
uttered
,
that
Kinraid
's
old
,
passionate
love
for
herself
had
faded
away
and
vanished
utterly
:
its
very
existence
apparently
blotted
out
of
his
memory
.
<EOS>
She
had
torn
up
her
love
for
him
by
the
roots
,
but
she
felt
as
if
she
could
never
forget
that
it
had
been
.
  
<EOS>
Hester
brought
back
Bella
to
her
mother
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
liked
to
interrupt
the
conversation
with
the
strange
lady
before
;
and
now
she
found
her
mother
in
an
obvious
state
of
excitement
;
Sylvia
quieter
than
usual
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
was
Kinraid
's
wife
,
Hester
!
<EOS>
Him
that
was
th
'
specksioneer
as
made
such
a
noise
about
t
'
place
at
the
time
of
Darley
's
death
.
<EOS>
He
's
now
a
captain
 
a
navy
captain
,
according
to
what
she
says
.
<EOS>
And
she
'd
fain
have
us
believe
that
Philip
is
abiding
in
all
manner
of
Scripture
places
;
places
as
has
been
long
done
away
with
,
but
the
similitude
whereof
is
in
the
heavens
,
where
the
elect
shall
one
day
see
them
.
<EOS>
And
she
says
Philip
is
there
,
and
a
soldier
,
and
that
he
saved
her
husband
's
life
,
and
is
coming
home
soon
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
John
and
Jeremiah
'll
say
to
his
soldiering
then
?
<EOS>
It
'll
noane
be
to
their
taste
,
I
'm
thinking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
all
very
unintelligible
to
Hester
,
and
she
would
dearly
have
liked
to
question
Sylvia
;
but
Sylvia
sate
a
little
apart
,
with
Bella
on
her
knee
,
her
cheek
resting
on
her
child
's
golden
curls
,
and
her
eyes
fixed
and
almost
trance
-
like
,
as
if
she
were
seeing
things
not
present
.
  
<EOS>
So
Hester
had
to
be
content
with
asking
her
mother
as
many
elucidatory
questions
as
she
could
;
and
after
all
did
not
gain
a
very
clear
idea
of
what
had
really
been
said
by
Mrs.
Kinraid
,
as
her
mother
was
more
full
of
the
apparent
injustice
of
Philip
's
being
allowed
the
privilege
of
treading
on
holy
ground
 
<EOS>
if
,
indeed
,
that
holy
ground
existed
on
this
side
heaven
,
which
she
was
inclined
to
dispute
 
than
to
confine
herself
to
the
repetition
of
words
,
or
narration
of
facts
.
  
<EOS>
Suddenly
Sylvia
roused
herself
to
a
sense
of
Hester
's
deep
interest
and
balked
inquiries
,
and
she
went
over
the
ground
rapidly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yo'r
mother
says
right
 
<EOS>
she
is
his
wife
.
<EOS>
And
he
's
away
fighting
;
and
got
too
near
t
'
French
as
was
shooting
and
firing
all
round
him
;
and
just
then
,
according
to
her
story
,
Philip
saw
him
,
and
went
straight
into
t
'
midst
o
'
t
'
shots
,
and
fetched
him
out
o
'
danger
.
<EOS>
That
's
what
she
says
,
and
upholds
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
should
it
not
be
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Hester
,
her
cheek
flushing
.
  
<EOS>
But
Sylvia
only
shook
her
head
,
and
said
,
  
"
I
can
not
tell
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
so
.
<EOS>
But
they
'd
little
cause
to
be
friends
,
and
it
seems
all
so
strange
 
<EOS>
Philip
a
soldier
,
and
them
meeting
theere
after
all
!
"
  
<EOS>
Hester
laid
the
story
of
Philip
's
bravery
to
her
heart
 
<EOS>
she
fully
believed
in
it
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
pondered
it
more
deeply
still
;
the
causes
for
her
disbelief
,
or
,
at
any
rate
,
for
her
wonder
,
were
unknown
to
Hester
!
<EOS>
Many
a
time
she
sank
to
sleep
with
the
picture
of
the
event
narrated
by
Mrs.
Kinraid
as
present
to
her
mind
as
her
imagination
or
experience
could
make
it
:
first
one
figure
prominent
,
then
another
.
<EOS>
Many
a
morning
she
wakened
up
,
her
heart
beating
wildly
,
why
,
she
knew
not
,
till
she
shuddered
at
the
remembrance
of
the
scenes
that
had
passed
in
her
dreams
:
scenes
that
might
be
acted
in
reality
that
very
day
;
for
Philip
might
come
back
,
and
then
?
  
<EOS>
And
where
was
Philip
all
this
time
,
these
many
weeks
,
these
heavily
passing
months
?
    
<EOS>
THE
BEDESMAN
OF
ST
SEPULCHRE
  
<EOS>
Philip
lay
long
ill
on
board
the
hospital
ship
.
<EOS>
If
his
heart
had
been
light
,
he
might
have
rallied
sooner
;
but
he
was
so
depressed
he
did
not
care
to
live
.
<EOS>
His
shattered
jaw
-
bone
,
his
burnt
and
blackened
face
,
his
many
injuries
of
body
,
were
torture
to
both
his
physical
frame
,
and
his
sick
,
weary
heart
.
<EOS>
No
more
chance
for
him
,
if
indeed
there
ever
had
been
any
,
of
returning
gay
and
gallant
,
and
thus
regaining
his
wife
's
love
.
<EOS>
This
had
been
his
poor
,
foolish
vision
in
the
first
hour
of
his
enlistment
;
and
the
vain
dream
had
recurred
more
than
once
in
the
feverish
stage
of
excitement
which
the
new
scenes
into
which
he
had
been
hurried
as
a
recruit
had
called
forth
.
<EOS>
But
that
was
all
over
now
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
it
was
the
most
unlikely
thing
in
the
world
to
have
come
to
pass
;
and
yet
those
were
happy
days
when
he
could
think
of
it
as
barely
possible
.
<EOS>
Now
all
he
could
look
forward
to
was
disfigurement
,
feebleness
,
and
the
bare
pittance
that
keeps
pensioners
from
absolute
want
.
  
<EOS>
Those
around
him
were
kind
enough
to
him
in
their
fashion
,
and
attended
to
his
bodily
requirements
;
but
they
had
no
notion
of
listening
to
any
revelations
of
unhappiness
,
if
Philip
had
been
the
man
to
make
confidences
of
that
kind
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
he
lay
very
still
in
his
berth
,
seldom
asking
for
anything
,
and
always
saying
he
was
better
,
when
the
ship
-
surgeon
came
round
with
his
daily
inquiries
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
care
to
rally
,
and
was
rather
sorry
to
find
that
his
case
was
considered
so
interesting
in
a
surgical
point
of
view
,
that
he
was
likely
to
receive
a
good
deal
more
than
the
average
amount
of
attention
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
was
owing
to
this
that
he
recovered
at
all
.
<EOS>
The
doctors
said
it
was
the
heat
that
made
him
languid
,
for
that
his
wounds
and
burns
were
all
doing
well
at
last
;
and
by
-
and
-
by
<EOS>
they
told
him
they
had
ordered
him
"
home
"
.
<EOS>
His
pulse
sank
under
the
surgeon
's
finger
at
the
mention
of
the
word
;
but
he
did
not
say
a
word
.
<EOS>
He
was
too
indifferent
to
life
and
the
world
to
have
a
will
;
otherwise
they
might
have
kept
their
pet
patient
a
little
longer
where
he
was
.
  
<EOS>
Slowly
passing
from
ship
to
ship
as
occasion
served
;
resting
here
and
there
in
garrison
hospitals
,
Philip
at
length
reached
Portsmouth
on
the
evening
of
a
September
day
in
1799
.
<EOS>
The
transport
-
ship
in
which
he
was
,
was
loaded
with
wounded
and
invalided
soldiers
and
sailors
;
all
who
could
manage
it
in
any
way
struggled
on
deck
to
catch
the
first
view
of
the
white
coasts
of
England
.
<EOS>
One
man
lifted
his
arm
,
took
off
his
cap
,
and
feebly
waved
it
aloft
,
crying
,
"
Old
England
for
ever
!
"
<EOS>
in
a
faint
shrill
voice
,
and
then
burst
into
tears
and
sobbed
aloud
.
<EOS>
Others
tried
to
pipe
up
"
Rule
Britannia
"
,
while
more
sate
,
weak
and
motionless
,
looking
towards
the
shores
that
once
,
not
so
long
ago
,
they
never
thought
to
see
again
.
<EOS>
Philip
was
one
of
these
;
his
place
a
little
apart
from
the
other
men
.
<EOS>
He
was
muffled
up
in
a
great
military
cloak
that
had
been
given
him
by
one
of
his
officers
;
he
felt
the
September
breeze
chill
after
his
sojourn
in
a
warmer
climate
,
and
in
his
shattered
state
of
health
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
ship
came
in
sight
of
Portsmouth
harbour
,
the
signal
flags
ran
up
the
ropes
;
the
beloved
Union
Jack
floated
triumphantly
over
all
.
<EOS>
Return
signals
were
made
from
the
harbour
;
on
board
all
became
bustle
and
preparation
for
landing
;
while
on
shore
there
was
the
evident
movement
of
expectation
,
and
men
in
uniform
were
seen
pressing
their
way
to
the
front
,
as
if
to
them
belonged
the
right
of
reception
.
<EOS>
They
were
the
men
from
the
barrack
hospital
,
that
had
been
signalled
for
,
come
down
with
ambulance
litters
and
other
marks
of
forethought
for
the
sick
and
wounded
,
who
were
returning
to
the
country
for
which
they
had
fought
and
suffered
.
  
<EOS>
With
a
dash
and
a
great
rocking
swing
the
vessel
came
up
to
her
appointed
place
,
and
was
safely
moored
.
<EOS>
Philip
sat
still
,
almost
as
if
he
had
no
part
in
the
cries
of
welcome
,
the
bustling
care
,
the
loud
directions
that
cut
the
air
around
him
,
and
pierced
his
nerves
through
and
through
.
<EOS>
But
one
in
authority
gave
the
order
;
and
Philip
,
disciplined
to
obedience
,
rose
to
find
his
knapsack
and
leave
the
ship
.
<EOS>
Passive
as
he
seemed
to
be
,
he
had
his
likings
for
particular
comrades
;
there
was
one
especially
,
a
man
as
different
from
Philip
as
well
could
be
,
to
whom
the
latter
had
always
attached
himself
;
a
merry
fellow
from
Somersetshire
,
who
was
almost
always
cheerful
and
bright
,
though
Philip
had
overheard
the
doctors
<EOS>
say
he
would
never
be
the
man
he
was
<EOS>
before
he
had
that
shot
through
the
side
.
<EOS>
This
marine
would
often
sit
making
his
fellows
laugh
,
and
laughing
himself
at
his
own
good
-
humoured
jokes
,
till
so
terrible
a
fit
of
coughing
came
on
that
those
around
him
feared
he
would
die
in
the
paroxysm
.
<EOS>
After
one
of
these
fits
he
had
gasped
out
some
words
,
which
led
Philip
to
question
him
a
little
;
and
it
turned
out
that
in
the
quiet
little
village
of
Potterne
,
far
inland
,
nestled
beneath
the
high
stretches
of
Salisbury
Plain
,
he
had
a
wife
and
a
child
,
a
little
girl
,
just
the
same
age
even
to
a
week
as
Philip
's
own
little
Bella
.
<EOS>
It
was
this
that
drew
Philip
towards
the
man
;
and
this
that
made
Philip
wait
and
go
ashore
along
with
the
poor
consumptive
marine
.
  
<EOS>
The
litters
had
moved
off
towards
the
hospital
,
the
sergeant
in
charge
had
given
his
words
of
command
to
the
remaining
invalids
,
who
tried
to
obey
them
to
the
best
of
their
power
,
falling
into
something
like
military
order
for
their
march
;
but
soon
,
very
soon
,
the
weakest
broke
step
,
and
lagged
behind
;
and
felt
as
if
the
rough
welcomes
and
rude
expressions
of
sympathy
from
the
crowd
around
were
almost
too
much
for
them
.
<EOS>
Philip
and
his
companion
were
about
midway
,
when
suddenly
a
young
woman
with
a
child
in
her
arms
forced
herself
through
the
people
,
between
the
soldiers
who
kept
pressing
on
either
side
,
and
threw
herself
on
the
neck
of
Philip
's
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Jem
!
"
she
sobbed
,
"
I
've
walked
all
the
road
from
Potterne
.
<EOS>
I
've
never
stopped
but
for
food
and
rest
for
Nelly
,
and
now
I
've
got
you
once
again
<EOS>
,
I
've
got
you
once
again
,
bless
God
for
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
did
not
seem
to
see
the
deadly
change
that
had
come
over
her
husband
since
she
parted
with
him
a
ruddy
young
labourer
;
she
had
got
him
once
again
,
as
she
phrased
it
,
and
that
was
enough
for
her
;
she
kissed
his
face
,
his
hands
,
his
very
coat
,
nor
would
she
be
repulsed
from
walking
beside
him
and
holding
his
hand
,
while
her
little
girl
ran
along
scared
by
the
voices
and
the
strange
faces
,
and
clinging
to
her
mammy
's
gown
.
  
<EOS>
Jem
coughed
,
poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
he
coughed
his
churchyard
cough
;
and
Philip
bitterly
envied
him
 
envied
his
life
,
envied
his
approaching
death
;
for
was
he
not
wrapped
round
with
that
woman
's
tender
love
,
and
is
not
such
love
stronger
than
death
?
<EOS>
Philip
had
felt
as
if
his
own
heart
was
grown
numb
,
and
as
though
it
had
changed
to
a
cold
heavy
stone
.
<EOS>
But
at
the
contrast
of
this
man
's
lot
to
his
own
,
he
felt
that
he
had
yet
the
power
of
suffering
left
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
road
they
had
to
go
was
full
of
people
,
kept
off
in
some
measure
by
the
guard
of
soldiers
.
<EOS>
All
sorts
of
kindly
speeches
,
and
many
a
curious
question
,
were
addressed
to
the
poor
invalids
as
they
walked
along
.
<EOS>
Philip
's
jaw
,
and
the
lower
part
of
his
face
,
were
bandaged
up
;
his
cap
was
slouched
down
;
he
held
his
cloak
about
him
,
and
shivered
within
its
folds
.
  
<EOS>
They
came
to
a
standstill
from
some
slight
obstacle
at
the
corner
of
a
street
.
<EOS>
Down
the
causeway
of
this
street
a
naval
officer
with
a
lady
on
his
arm
was
walking
briskly
,
with
a
step
that
told
of
health
and
a
light
heart
.
<EOS>
He
stayed
his
progress
though
,
when
he
saw
the
convoy
of
maimed
and
wounded
men
;
he
said
something
,
of
which
Philip
only
caught
the
words
,
"
same
uniform
,
"
"
for
his
sake
,
"
to
the
young
lady
,
whose
cheek
blanched
a
little
,
but
whose
eyes
kindled
.
<EOS>
Then
leaving
her
for
an
instant
,
he
pressed
forward
;
he
was
close
to
Philip
,
 
poor
sad
Philip
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
,
 
so
absorbed
that
he
noticed
nothing
till
he
heard
a
voice
at
his
ear
,
having
the
Northumbrian
burr
,
the
Newcastle
inflections
which
he
knew
of
old
,
and
that
were
to
him
like
the
sick
memory
of
a
deadly
illness
;
and
then
he
turned
his
muffled
face
to
the
speaker
,
though
he
knew
well
enough
who
it
was
,
and
averted
his
eyes
after
one
sight
of
the
handsome
,
happy
man
,
 
<EOS>
the
man
whose
life
he
had
saved
once
,
and
would
save
again
,
at
the
risk
of
his
own
,
but
whom
,
for
all
that
,
he
prayed
that
he
might
never
meet
more
on
earth
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
,
my
fine
fellow
,
take
this
,
"
forcing
a
crown
piece
into
Philip
's
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
it
were
more
;
I
'd
give
you
a
pound
if
I
had
it
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
muttered
something
,
and
held
out
the
coin
to
Captain
Kinraid
,
of
course
in
vain
;
nor
was
there
time
to
urge
it
back
upon
the
giver
,
for
the
obstacle
to
their
progress
was
suddenly
removed
,
the
crowd
pressed
upon
the
captain
and
his
wife
,
the
procession
moved
on
,
and
Philip
along
with
it
,
holding
the
piece
in
his
hand
,
and
longing
to
throw
it
far
away
.
<EOS>
Indeed
he
was
on
the
point
of
dropping
it
,
hoping
to
do
so
unperceived
,
when
he
bethought
him
of
giving
it
to
Jem
's
wife
,
the
footsore
woman
,
limping
happily
along
by
her
husband
's
side
.
<EOS>
They
thanked
him
,
and
spoke
in
his
praise
more
than
he
could
well
bear
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
credit
to
him
to
give
that
away
which
burned
his
fingers
as
long
as
he
kept
it
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
knew
that
the
injuries
he
had
received
in
the
explosion
on
board
the
_
Theseus
_
would
oblige
him
to
leave
the
service
.
<EOS>
He
also
believed
that
they
would
entitle
him
to
a
pension
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
little
interest
in
his
future
life
;
he
was
without
hope
,
and
in
a
depressed
state
of
health
.
<EOS>
He
remained
for
some
little
time
stationary
,
and
then
went
through
all
the
forms
of
dismissal
on
account
of
wounds
received
in
service
,
and
was
turned
out
loose
upon
the
world
,
uncertain
where
to
go
,
indifferent
as
to
what
became
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
fine
,
warm
October
weather
as
he
turned
his
back
upon
the
coast
,
and
set
off
on
his
walk
northwards
.
<EOS>
Green
leaves
were
yet
upon
the
trees
;
the
hedges
were
one
flush
of
foliage
and
the
wild
rough
-
flavoured
fruits
of
different
kinds
;
the
fields
were
tawny
with
the
uncleared
-
off
stubble
,
or
emerald
green
with
the
growth
of
the
aftermath
.
<EOS>
The
roadside
cottage
gardens
were
gay
with
hollyhocks
and
Michaelmas
daisies
and
marigolds
,
and
the
bright
panes
of
the
windows
glittered
through
a
veil
of
China
roses
.
  
<EOS>
The
war
was
a
popular
one
,
and
,
as
a
natural
consequence
,
soldiers
and
sailors
were
heroes
everywhere
.
<EOS>
Philip
's
long
drooping
form
,
his
arm
hung
in
a
sling
,
his
face
scarred
and
blackened
<EOS>
,
his
jaw
bound
up
with
a
black
silk
handkerchief
;
these
marks
of
active
service
were
reverenced
by
the
rustic
cottagers
as
though
they
had
been
crowns
and
sceptres
.
<EOS>
Many
a
hard
-
handed
labourer
left
his
seat
by
the
chimney
corner
,
and
came
to
his
door
to
have
a
look
at
one
who
had
been
fighting
the
French
,
and
pushed
forward
to
have
a
grasp
of
the
stranger
's
hand
as
he
gave
back
the
empty
cup
into
the
good
wife
's
keeping
,
for
the
kind
homely
women
were
ever
ready
with
milk
or
homebrewed
to
slake
the
feverish
traveller
's
thirst
when
he
stopped
at
their
doors
and
asked
for
a
drink
of
water
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
village
public
-
house
he
had
had
a
welcome
of
a
more
interested
character
,
for
the
landlord
knew
full
well
that
his
circle
of
customers
would
be
large
that
night
,
if
it
was
only
known
that
he
had
within
his
doors
a
soldier
or
a
sailor
who
had
seen
service
.
<EOS>
The
rustic
politicians
would
gather
round
Philip
,
and
smoke
and
drink
,
and
then
question
and
discuss
till
they
were
drouthy
again
;
and
in
their
sturdy
obtuse
minds
they
set
down
the
extra
glass
and
the
supernumerary
pipe
to
the
score
of
patriotism
.
  
<EOS>
Altogether
human
nature
turned
its
sunny
side
out
to
Philip
just
now
;
and
not
before
he
needed
the
warmth
of
brotherly
kindness
to
cheer
his
shivering
soul
.
<EOS>
Day
after
day
he
drifted
northwards
,
making
<EOS>
but
the
slow
progress
of
a
feeble
man
,
and
yet
this
short
daily
walk
tired
him
so
much
that
he
longed
for
rest
 
for
the
morning
to
come
when
he
needed
not
to
feel
that
in
the
course
of
an
hour
or
two
he
must
be
up
and
away
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
toiling
on
with
this
longing
at
his
heart
when
he
saw
that
he
was
drawing
near
a
stately
city
,
with
a
great
old
cathedral
in
the
centre
keeping
solemn
guard
.
<EOS>
This
place
might
be
yet
two
or
three
miles
distant
;
he
was
on
a
rising
ground
looking
down
upon
it
.
<EOS>
A
labouring
man
passing
by
,
observed
his
pallid
looks
and
his
languid
attitude
,
and
told
him
for
his
comfort
,
that
if
he
turned
down
a
lane
to
the
left
a
few
steps
farther
on
,
he
would
find
himself
at
the
Hospital
of
St
Sepulchre
,
where
bread
and
beer
were
given
to
all
comers
,
and
where
he
might
sit
him
down
and
rest
awhile
on
the
old
stone
benches
within
the
shadow
of
the
gateway
.
<EOS>
Obeying
these
directions
,
Philip
came
upon
a
building
which
dated
from
the
time
of
Henry
the
Fifth
.
<EOS>
Some
knight
who
had
fought
in
the
French
wars
of
that
time
,
and
had
survived
his
battles
and
come
home
to
his
old
halls
,
had
been
stirred
up
by
his
conscience
,
or
by
what
was
equivalent
in
those
days
,
his
confessor
,
to
build
and
endow
a
hospital
for
twelve
decayed
soldiers
,
and
a
chapel
wherein
they
were
to
attend
the
daily
masses
he
ordained
to
be
said
till
the
end
of
all
time
(
which
eternity
lasted
rather
more
than
a
century
,
pretty
well
for
an
eternity
bespoken
by
a
man
)
,
for
his
soul
and
the
souls
of
those
whom
he
had
slain
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
large
division
of
the
quadrangular
building
set
apart
for
the
priest
who
was
to
say
these
masses
;
and
to
watch
over
the
well
-
being
of
the
bedesmen
.
<EOS>
In
process
of
years
the
origin
and
primary
purpose
of
the
hospital
had
been
forgotten
by
all
excepting
the
local
antiquaries
;
and
the
place
itself
came
to
be
regarded
as
a
very
pleasant
quaint
set
of
almshouses
;
and
the
warden
's
office
(
he
who
should
have
said
or
sung
<EOS>
his
daily
masses
was
now
called
the
warden
,
and
read
daily
prayers
and
preached
a
sermon
on
Sundays
)
an
agreeable
sinecure
.
  
<EOS>
Another
legacy
of
old
Sir
Simon
Bray
was
that
of
a
small
croft
of
land
,
the
rent
or
profits
of
which
were
to
go
towards
giving
to
all
who
asked
for
it
a
manchet
of
bread
and
a
cup
of
good
beer
.
<EOS>
This
beer
was
,
so
Sir
Simon
ordained
,
to
be
made
after
a
certain
receipt
which
he
left
,
in
which
ground
ivy
took
the
place
of
hops
.
<EOS>
But
the
receipt
,
as
well
as
the
masses
,
was
modernized
according
to
the
progress
of
time
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
stood
under
a
great
broad
stone
archway
;
the
back
-
door
into
the
warden
's
house
was
on
the
right
side
;
a
kind
of
buttery
-
hatch
was
placed
by
the
porter
's
door
on
the
opposite
side
.
<EOS>
After
some
consideration
,
Philip
knocked
at
the
closed
shutter
,
and
the
signal
seemed
to
be
well
understood
.
<EOS>
He
heard
a
movement
within
;
the
hatch
was
drawn
aside
,
and
his
bread
and
beer
were
handed
to
him
by
a
pleasant
-
looking
old
man
,
who
proved
himself
not
at
all
disinclined
for
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
sit
down
on
yonder
bench
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nay
,
man
!
<EOS>
sit
i
'
the
sun
<EOS>
,
for
it
's
a
chilly
place
,
this
,
and
then
you
can
look
through
the
grate
and
watch
th
'
old
fellows
toddling
about
in
th
'
quad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
sat
down
where
the
warm
October
sun
slanted
upon
him
,
and
looked
through
the
iron
railing
at
the
peaceful
sight
.
  
<EOS>
A
great
square
of
velvet
lawn
,
intersected
diagonally
with
broad
flag
-
paved
walks
,
the
same
kind
of
walk
going
all
round
the
quadrangle
;
low
two
-
storied
brick
houses
,
tinted
gray
and
yellow
by
age
,
and
in
many
places
almost
covered
with
vines
,
Virginian
creepers
,
and
monthly
roses
;
before
each
house
a
little
plot
of
garden
ground
,
bright
with
flowers
,
and
evidently
tended
with
the
utmost
care
;
on
the
farther
side
<EOS>
the
massive
chapel
;
here
and
there
an
old
or
infirm
man
sunning
himself
,
or
leisurely
doing
a
bit
of
gardening
,
or
talking
to
one
of
his
comrades
 
<EOS>
the
place
looked
as
if
care
and
want
,
and
even
sorrow
,
were
locked
out
and
excluded
by
the
ponderous
gate
through
which
Philip
was
gazing
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
nice
enough
place
,
<EOS>
bean't
it
?
"
said
the
porter
,
interpreting
Philip
's
looks
pretty
accurately
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Leastways
,
for
them
as
likes
it
.
<EOS>
I
've
got
a
bit
weary
on
it
myself
;
it
's
so
far
from
th
'
world
,
as
a
man
may
say
;
not
a
decent
public
within
a
mile
and
a
half
,
where
one
can
hear
<EOS>
a
bit
o
'
news
of
an
evening
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
could
make
myself
very
content
here
,
"
replied
Philip
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
to
say
,
if
one
were
easy
in
one
's
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
my
man
.
<EOS>
That
's
it
everywhere
.
<EOS>
Why
,
I
do
n't
think
that
I
could
enjoy
myself
 
not
even
at
th
'
White
Hart
,
where
they
give
you
as
good
a
glass
of
ale
for
twopence
as
anywhere
<EOS>
i
'
th
'
four
kingdoms
 
<EOS>
I
could
n't
,
to
say
,
flavour
my
ale
even
there
,
if
my
old
woman
lay
a
-
dying
;
which
is
a
sign
as
it
's
the
heart
,
and
not
the
ale
,
as
makes
the
drink
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Just
then
the
warden
's
back
-
door
opened
,
and
out
came
the
warden
himself
,
dressed
in
full
clerical
costume
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
going
into
the
neighbouring
city
,
but
he
stopped
to
speak
to
Philip
,
the
wounded
soldier
;
and
all
the
more
readily
because
his
old
faded
uniform
told
the
warden
's
experienced
eye
that
he
had
belonged
to
the
Marines
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
enjoy
the
victual
provided
for
you
by
the
founder
of
St
Sepulchre
,
"
said
he
,
kindly
.
<EOS>
"
You
look
but
poorly
,
my
good
fellow
,
and
as
if
a
slice
of
good
cold
meat
would
help
your
bread
down
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
sir
!
"
said
Philip
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
hungry
,
only
weary
,
and
glad
of
a
draught
of
beer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
've
been
in
the
Marines
,
I
see
.
<EOS>
Where
have
you
been
serving
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
at
the
siege
of
Acre
,
last
May
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
At
Acre
!
<EOS>
Were
you
,
indeed
?
<EOS>
Then
perhaps
you
know
my
boy
Harry
?
<EOS>
He
was
in
the
#
#
#
#
th
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
my
company
,
"
said
Philip
,
warming
up
a
little
.
<EOS>
Looking
back
upon
his
soldier
's
life
,
it
seemed
to
him
to
have
many
charms
,
because
it
was
so
full
of
small
daily
interests
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
did
you
know
my
son
,
Lieutenant
Pennington
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
he
that
gave
me
this
cloak
,
sir
,
when
they
were
sending
me
back
to
England
.
<EOS>
I
had
been
his
servant
for
a
short
time
before
I
was
wounded
by
the
explosion
on
board
the
_
Theseus
_
,
and
he
said
I
should
feel
the
cold
of
the
voyage
.
<EOS>
He
's
very
kind
;
and
I
've
heard
say
he
promises
to
be
a
first
-
rate
officer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
a
slice
of
roast
beef
,
whether
you
want
it
or
not
,
"
said
the
warden
,
ringing
the
bell
at
his
own
back
-
door
.
<EOS>
"
I
recognize
the
cloak
now
 
the
young
scamp
!
<EOS>
How
soon
he
has
made
it
shabby
,
though
,
"
he
continued
,
taking
up
a
corner
where
there
was
an
immense
tear
not
too
well
botched
up
.
"
<EOS>
And
so
you
were
on
board
the
_
Theseus
_
at
the
time
of
the
explosion
?
<EOS>
Bring
some
cold
meat
here
for
the
good
man
 
or
stay
!
<EOS>
Come
in
with
me
,
and
then
you
can
tell
Mrs.
Pennington
and
the
young
ladies
all
you
know
about
Harry
,
 
and
the
siege
,
 
and
the
explosion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
Philip
was
ushered
into
the
warden
's
house
and
made
to
eat
roast
beef
almost
against
his
will
;
and
he
was
questioned
and
cross
-
questioned
by
three
eager
ladies
,
all
at
the
same
time
,
as
it
seemed
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
given
all
possible
details
on
the
subjects
about
which
they
were
curious
;
and
was
beginning
to
consider
how
he
could
best
make
his
retreat
,
when
the
younger
Miss
Pennington
went
up
to
her
father
 
who
had
all
this
time
stood
,
with
his
hat
on
,
holding
his
coat
-
tails
over
his
arms
,
with
his
back
to
the
fire
.
<EOS>
He
bent
his
ear
down
a
very
little
to
hear
some
whispered
suggestion
of
his
daughter
's
,
nodded
his
head
,
and
then
went
on
questioning
Philip
,
with
kindly
inquisitiveness
and
patronage
,
as
the
rich
do
question
the
poor
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
where
are
you
going
to
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
Philip
did
not
answer
directly
.
<EOS>
He
wondered
in
his
own
mind
where
he
was
going
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
said
,
  
"
Northwards
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
But
perhaps
I
shall
never
reach
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
n't
you
friends
?
<EOS>
Are
n't
you
going
to
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
again
a
pause
;
a
cloud
came
over
Philip
's
countenance
.
<EOS>
He
said
,
  
"
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
I
'm
not
going
to
my
friends
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
that
I
've
got
any
left
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
interpreted
his
looks
and
this
speech
to
mean
that
he
had
either
lost
his
friends
by
death
,
or
offended
them
by
enlisting
.
  
<EOS>
The
warden
went
on
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
because
we
've
got
a
cottage
vacant
in
the
mead
.
<EOS>
Old
Dobson
,
who
was
with
General
Wolfe
at
the
taking
of
Quebec
,
died
a
fortnight
ago
.
<EOS>
With
such
injuries
as
yours
,
I
fear
you
'll
never
be
able
to
work
again
.
<EOS>
But
we
require
strict
testimonials
as
to
character
,
"
he
added
,
with
as
penetrating
a
look
as
he
could
summon
up
at
Philip
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
looked
unmoved
,
either
by
the
offer
of
the
cottage
,
or
the
illusion
to
the
possibility
of
his
character
not
being
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
He
was
grateful
enough
in
reality
,
but
too
heavy
at
heart
to
care
very
much
what
became
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
warden
and
his
family
,
who
were
accustomed
to
consider
a
settlement
at
St
Sepulchre
's
as
the
sum
of
all
good
to
a
worn
-
out
soldier
,
were
a
little
annoyed
at
Philip
's
cool
way
of
receiving
the
proposition
.
<EOS>
The
warden
went
on
to
name
the
contingent
advantages
.
  
<EOS>
"
Besides
the
cottage
,
you
would
have
a
load
of
wood
for
firing
on
All
Saints
'
,
on
Christmas
,
and
on
Candlemas
days
 
a
blue
gown
and
suit
of
clothes
to
match
every
Michaelmas
,
and
a
shilling
a
day
to
keep
yourself
in
all
other
things
.
<EOS>
Your
dinner
you
would
have
with
the
other
men
,
in
hall
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
warden
himself
goes
into
hall
every
day
,
and
sees
that
everything
is
comfortable
,
and
says
grace
,
"
added
the
warden
's
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
I
seem
stupid
,
"
said
Philip
,
almost
humbly
,
"
not
to
be
more
grateful
,
<EOS>
for
it
's
far
beyond
what
I
iver
expected
or
thought
for
again
,
and
it
's
a
great
temptation
,
for
I
'm
just
worn
out
with
fatigue
.
<EOS>
Several
times
I
've
thought
I
must
lie
down
under
a
hedge
,
and
just
die
for
very
weariness
.
<EOS>
But
once
I
had
a
wife
and
a
child
up
in
the
north
,
"
he
stopped
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
are
they
dead
?
"
<EOS>
asked
one
of
the
young
ladies
in
a
soft
sympathizing
tone
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
met
Philip
's
,
full
of
dumb
woe
.
<EOS>
He
tried
to
speak
;
he
wanted
to
explain
more
fully
,
yet
not
to
reveal
the
truth
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
the
warden
,
thinking
he
perceived
the
real
state
of
things
,
"
what
I
propose
is
this
.
<EOS>
You
shall
go
into
old
Dobson
's
house
at
once
,
as
a
kind
of
probationary
bedesman
.
<EOS>
I
'll
write
to
Harry
,
and
get
your
character
from
him
.
<EOS>
Stephen
Freeman
I
think
you
said
your
name
was
?
<EOS>
Before
I
can
receive
his
reply
you
'll
have
been
able
to
tell
how
you
'd
like
the
kind
of
life
;
and
at
any
rate
you
'll
have
the
rest
you
seem
to
require
in
the
meantime
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
I
take
Harry
's
having
given
you
that
cloak
as
a
kind
of
character
,
"
added
he
,
smiling
kindly
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
'll
have
to
conform
to
rules
just
like
all
the
rest
,
 
chapel
at
eight
,
dinner
at
twelve
,
lights
out
at
nine
;
but
I
'll
tell
you
the
remainder
of
our
regulations
as
we
walk
across
quad
to
your
new
quarters
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
thus
Philip
,
almost
in
spite
of
himself
,
became
installed
in
a
bedesman
's
house
at
St
Sepulchre
.
    
<EOS>
A
FABLE
<EOS>
AT
FAULT
  
<EOS>
Philip
took
possession
of
the
two
rooms
which
had
belonged
to
the
dead
Sergeant
Dobson
.
<EOS>
They
were
furnished
sufficiently
for
every
comfort
by
the
trustees
of
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
Some
little
fragments
of
ornament
,
some
small
articles
picked
up
in
distant
countries
,
a
few
tattered
books
,
remained
in
the
rooms
as
legacies
from
their
former
occupant
.
  
<EOS>
At
first
the
repose
of
the
life
and
the
place
was
inexpressibly
grateful
to
Philip
.
<EOS>
He
had
always
shrunk
from
encountering
strangers
,
and
displaying
his
blackened
and
scarred
countenance
to
them
,
even
where
such
disfigurement
was
most
regarded
as
a
mark
of
honour
.
<EOS>
In
St
Sepulchre
's
he
met
none
but
the
same
set
day
after
day
,
and
when
he
had
once
told
the
tale
of
how
it
happened
and
submitted
to
their
gaze
,
it
was
over
for
ever
,
if
he
so
minded
.
<EOS>
The
slight
employment
his
garden
gave
him
 
there
was
a
kitchen
-
garden
behind
each
house
,
as
well
as
the
flower
-
plot
in
front
 
and
the
daily
arrangement
of
his
parlour
and
chamber
were
,
at
the
beginning
of
his
time
of
occupation
,
as
much
bodily
labour
as
he
could
manage
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
stately
and
utterly
removed
from
all
Philip
's
previous
existence
in
the
forms
observed
at
every
day
's
dinner
,
when
the
twelve
bedesmen
met
in
the
large
quaint
hall
,
and
the
warden
came
in
his
college
-
cap
and
gown
to
say
the
long
Latin
grace
which
wound
up
with
something
very
like
a
prayer
for
the
soul
of
Sir
Simon
Bray
.
<EOS>
It
took
some
time
to
get
a
reply
to
ship
letters
in
those
times
when
no
one
could
exactly
say
where
the
fleet
might
be
found
.
  
<EOS>
And
before
Dr
Pennington
had
received
the
excellent
character
of
Stephen
Freeman
,
which
his
son
gladly
sent
in
answer
to
his
father
's
inquiries
,
Philip
had
become
restless
and
uneasy
in
the
midst
of
all
this
peace
and
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
Sitting
alone
over
his
fire
in
the
long
winter
evenings
,
the
scenes
of
his
past
life
rose
before
him
;
his
childhood
;
his
aunt
Robson
's
care
of
him
;
his
first
going
to
Foster
's
shop
in
Monkshaven
;
Haytersbank
Farm
,
and
the
spelling
lessons
in
the
bright
warm
kitchen
there
;
Kinraid
's
appearance
;
the
miserable
night
of
the
Corneys
'
party
;
the
farewell
he
had
witnessed
on
Monkshaven
sands
;
the
press
-
gang
,
and
all
the
long
consequences
of
that
act
of
concealment
;
poor
Daniel
Robson
's
trial
and
execution
;
his
own
marriage
;
his
child
's
birth
;
and
then
he
came
to
that
last
day
at
Monkshaven
:
and
he
went
over
and
over
again
the
torturing
details
,
the
looks
of
contempt
and
anger
,
the
words
of
loathing
indignation
,
till
he
almost
brought
himself
,
out
of
his
extreme
sympathy
with
Sylvia
,
to
believe
that
he
was
indeed
the
wretch
she
had
considered
him
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
He
forgot
his
own
excuses
for
having
acted
as
he
had
done
;
though
these
excuses
had
at
one
time
seemed
to
him
to
wear
the
garb
of
reasons
.
<EOS>
After
long
thought
and
bitter
memory
came
some
wonder
.
<EOS>
What
was
Sylvia
doing
now
?
<EOS>
Where
was
she
?
<EOS>
What
was
his
child
like
 
his
child
as
well
as
hers
?
<EOS>
And
then
he
remembered
the
poor
footsore
wife
and
the
little
girl
she
carried
in
her
arms
,
that
was
just
the
age
of
Bella
;
he
wished
he
had
noticed
that
child
more
,
that
a
clear
vision
of
it
might
rise
up
when
he
wanted
to
picture
Bella
.
  
<EOS>
One
night
he
had
gone
round
this
mill
-
wheel
circle
of
ideas
till
he
was
weary
to
the
very
marrow
of
his
bones
.
<EOS>
To
shake
off
the
monotonous
impression
he
rose
to
look
for
a
book
amongst
the
old
tattered
volumes
,
hoping
that
he
might
find
something
that
would
sufficiently
lay
hold
of
him
to
change
the
current
of
his
thoughts
.
<EOS>
There
was
an
old
volume
of
_
Peregrine
Pickle
_
;
a
book
of
sermons
;
half
an
army
list
of
1774
,
and
the
_
Seven
Champions
of
Christendom
_
.
<EOS>
Philip
took
up
this
last
,
which
he
had
never
seen
before
.
<EOS>
In
it
he
read
how
Sir
Guy
,
Earl
of
Warwick
,
went
to
fight
the
Paynim
in
his
own
country
,
and
was
away
for
seven
long
years
;
and
when
he
came
back
his
own
wife
Phillis
,
the
countess
in
her
castle
,
did
not
know
the
poor
travel
-
worn
hermit
,
who
came
daily
to
seek
his
dole
of
bread
at
her
hands
along
with
many
beggars
and
much
poor
.
<EOS>
But
at
last
,
when
he
lay
a
-
dying
in
his
cave
in
the
rock
,
he
sent
for
her
by
a
secret
sign
known
but
to
them
twain
.
<EOS>
And
she
came
with
great
speed
,
for
she
knew
it
was
her
lord
who
had
sent
for
her
;
and
they
had
many
sweet
and
holy
words
together
before
he
gave
up
the
ghost
,
his
head
lying
on
her
bosom
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
story
known
to
most
people
from
their
childhood
was
all
new
and
fresh
to
Philip
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
quite
believe
in
the
truth
of
it
,
because
the
fictitious
nature
of
the
histories
of
some
of
the
other
Champions
of
Christendom
was
too
patent
.
<EOS>
But
he
could
not
help
thinking
that
this
one
might
be
true
;
and
that
Guy
and
Phillis
might
have
been
as
real
flesh
and
blood
,
long
,
long
ago
,
as
he
and
Sylvia
had
even
been
.
<EOS>
The
old
room
,
the
quiet
moonlit
quadrangle
into
which
the
cross
-
barred
casement
looked
,
the
quaint
aspect
of
everything
that
he
had
seen
for
weeks
and
weeks
;
all
this
predisposed
Philip
to
dwell
upon
the
story
he
had
just
been
reading
as
a
faithful
legend
of
two
lovers
whose
bones
were
long
since
dust
.
<EOS>
He
thought
that
if
he
could
thus
see
Sylvia
,
himself
unknown
,
unseen
 
could
live
at
her
gates
,
so
to
speak
,
and
gaze
upon
her
and
his
child
 
some
day
too
,
when
he
lay
a
-
dying
,
he
might
send
for
her
,
and
in
soft
words
of
mutual
forgiveness
breathe
his
life
away
in
her
arms
.
<EOS>
Or
perhaps
 
and
so
he
lost
himself
,
and
from
thinking
,
passed
on
to
dreaming
.
<EOS>
All
night
long
Guy
and
Phillis
,
Sylvia
and
his
child
,
passed
in
and
out
of
his
visions
;
it
was
impossible
to
make
the
fragments
of
his
dreams
cohere
;
but
the
impression
made
upon
him
by
them
was
not
the
less
strong
for
this
.
<EOS>
He
felt
as
if
he
were
called
to
Monkshaven
,
wanted
at
Monkshaven
,
and
to
Monkshaven
he
resolved
to
go
;
although
when
his
reason
overtook
his
feeling
,
he
knew
perfectly
how
unwise
it
was
to
leave
a
home
of
peace
and
tranquillity
and
surrounding
friendliness
,
to
go
to
a
place
where
nothing
but
want
and
wretchedness
awaited
him
unless
he
made
himself
known
;
and
if
he
did
,
a
deeper
want
,
a
more
woeful
wretchedness
,
would
in
all
probability
be
his
portion
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
small
oblong
of
looking
-
glass
hung
against
the
wall
,
Philip
caught
the
reflection
of
his
own
face
,
and
laughed
scornfully
at
the
sight
.
<EOS>
The
thin
hair
lay
upon
his
temples
in
the
flakes
that
betoken
long
ill
-
health
;
his
eyes
were
the
same
as
ever
,
and
they
had
always
been
considered
the
best
feature
in
his
face
;
but
they
were
sunk
in
their
orbits
,
and
looked
hollow
and
gloomy
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
lower
part
of
his
face
,
blackened
,
contracted
,
drawn
away
from
his
teeth
,
the
outline
entirely
changed
by
the
breakage
of
his
jaw
-
bone
,
he
was
indeed
a
fool
if
he
thought
himself
fit
to
go
forth
to
win
back
that
love
which
Sylvia
had
forsworn
.
<EOS>
As
a
hermit
and
a
beggar
,
he
must
return
to
Monkshaven
,
and
fall
perforce
into
the
same
position
which
Guy
of
Warwick
had
only
assumed
.
<EOS>
But
still
he
should
see
his
Phillis
,
and
might
feast
his
sad
hopeless
eyes
from
time
to
time
with
the
sight
of
his
child
.
<EOS>
His
small
pension
of
sixpence
a
day
would
keep
him
from
absolute
want
of
necessaries
.
  
<EOS>
So
that
very
day
he
went
to
the
warden
and
told
him
he
thought
of
giving
up
his
share
in
the
bequest
of
Sir
Simon
Bray
.
<EOS>
Such
a
relinquishment
had
never
occurred
before
in
all
the
warden
's
experience
;
and
he
was
very
much
inclined
to
be
offended
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
say
that
for
a
man
not
to
be
satisfied
as
a
bedesman
of
St
Sepulchre
's
<EOS>
argues
a
very
wrong
state
of
mind
,
and
a
very
ungrateful
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
,
sir
,
it
's
not
from
any
ingratitude
,
for
I
can
hardly
feel
thankful
to
you
and
to
Sir
Simon
,
and
to
madam
,
and
the
young
ladies
,
and
all
my
comrades
in
the
hospital
,
and
I
niver
expect
to
be
either
so
comfortable
or
so
peaceful
again
,
but
   
'
  
"
<EOS>
But
?
<EOS>
What
can
you
have
to
say
against
the
place
,
then
?
<EOS>
Not
<EOS>
but
what
there
are
always
plenty
of
applicants
for
every
vacancy
;
only
I
thought
I
was
doing
a
kindness
to
a
man
out
of
Harry
's
company
.
<EOS>
And
you
'll
not
see
Harry
either
;
he
's
got
his
leave
in
March
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
very
sorry
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
have
seen
the
lieutenant
again
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
not
rest
any
longer
so
far
away
from
 
people
I
once
knew
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ten
to
one
they
're
dead
,
or
removed
,
or
something
or
other
by
this
time
;
and
it
'll
serve
you
right
if
they
are
.
<EOS>
Mind
!
<EOS>
no
one
can
be
chosen
twice
to
be
a
bedesman
of
St
Sepulchre
's
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
warden
turned
away
;
and
Philip
,
uneasy
at
staying
,
disheartened
at
leaving
,
went
to
make
his
few
preparations
for
setting
out
once
more
on
his
journey
northwards
.
<EOS>
He
had
to
give
notice
of
his
change
of
residence
to
the
local
distributor
of
pensions
;
and
one
or
two
farewells
had
to
be
taken
,
with
more
than
usual
sadness
at
the
necessity
;
for
Philip
,
under
his
name
of
Stephen
Freeman
,
had
attached
some
of
the
older
bedesmen
a
good
deal
to
him
,
from
his
unselfishness
,
his
willingness
to
read
to
them
,
and
to
render
them
many
little
services
,
and
,
perhaps
,
as
much
as
anything
,
by
his
habitual
silence
,
which
made
him
a
convenient
recipient
of
all
their
garrulousness
.
<EOS>
So
before
the
time
for
his
departure
came
,
he
had
the
opportunity
of
one
more
interview
with
the
warden
,
of
a
more
friendly
character
than
that
in
which
he
gave
up
his
bedesmanship
.
<EOS>
And
so
far
it
was
well
;
and
Philip
turned
his
back
upon
St
Sepulchre
's
with
his
sore
heart
partly
healed
by
his
four
months
'
residence
there
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
stronger
,
too
,
in
body
,
more
capable
of
the
day
-
after
-
day
walks
that
were
required
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
saved
some
money
from
his
allowance
as
bedesman
and
from
his
pension
,
and
might
occasionally
have
taken
an
outside
place
on
a
coach
,
had
it
not
been
that
he
shrank
from
the
first
look
of
every
stranger
upon
his
disfigured
face
.
<EOS>
Yet
the
gentle
,
wistful
eyes
,
and
the
white
and
faultless
teeth
always
did
away
with
the
first
impression
as
soon
as
people
became
a
little
acquainted
with
his
appearance
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
February
when
Philip
left
St
Sepulchre
's
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
first
week
in
April
when
he
began
to
recognize
the
familiar
objects
between
York
and
Monkshaven
.
<EOS>
And
now
he
began
to
hang
back
,
and
to
question
the
wisdom
of
what
he
had
done
 
just
as
the
warden
had
prophesied
that
he
would
.
<EOS>
The
last
night
of
his
two
hundred
mile
walk
he
slept
at
the
little
inn
at
which
he
had
been
enlisted
nearly
two
years
before
.
<EOS>
It
was
by
no
intention
of
his
that
he
rested
at
that
identical
place
.
<EOS>
Night
was
drawing
on
;
and
,
in
making
,
as
he
thought
,
a
short
cut
,
he
had
missed
his
way
,
and
was
fain
to
seek
shelter
where
he
might
find
it
.
<EOS>
But
it
brought
him
very
straight
face
to
face
with
his
life
at
that
time
,
and
ever
since
.
<EOS>
His
mad
,
wild
hopes
 
half
the
result
of
intoxication
,
as
he
now
knew
 
all
dead
and
gone
;
the
career
then
freshly
opening
shut
up
against
him
now
;
his
youthful
strength
and
health
changed
into
premature
infirmity
,
and
the
home
and
the
love
that
should
have
opened
wide
its
doors
to
console
him
for
all
,
why
in
two
years
Death
might
have
been
busy
,
and
taken
away
from
him
his
last
feeble
chance
of
the
faint
happiness
of
seeing
his
beloved
without
being
seen
or
known
of
her
.
<EOS>
All
that
night
and
all
the
next
day
,
the
fear
of
Sylvia
's
possible
death
overclouded
his
heart
.
<EOS>
It
was
strange
that
he
had
hardly
ever
thought
of
this
before
;
so
strange
,
that
now
,
when
the
terror
came
,
it
took
possession
of
him
,
and
he
could
almost
have
sworn
that
she
must
be
lying
dead
in
Monkshaven
churchyard
.
<EOS>
Or
was
it
little
Bella
,
that
blooming
,
lovely
babe
,
whom
he
was
never
to
see
again
?
<EOS>
There
was
the
tolling
of
mournful
bells
in
the
distant
air
to
his
disturbed
fancy
,
and
the
cry
of
the
happy
birds
,
the
plaintive
bleating
of
the
new
-
dropped
lambs
,
were
all
omens
of
evil
import
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
As
well
as
he
could
,
he
found
his
way
back
to
Monkshaven
,
over
the
wild
heights
and
moors
he
had
crossed
on
that
black
day
of
misery
;
why
he
should
have
chosen
that
path
<EOS>
he
could
not
tell
 
it
was
as
if
he
were
led
,
and
had
no
free
will
of
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
The
soft
clear
evening
was
drawing
on
,
and
his
heart
beat
thick
,
and
then
stopped
,
only
to
start
again
with
fresh
violence
.
<EOS>
There
he
was
,
at
the
top
of
the
long
,
steep
lane
that
was
in
some
parts
a
literal
staircase
leading
down
from
the
hill
-
top
into
the
High
Street
,
through
the
very
entry
up
which
he
had
passed
when
he
shrank
away
from
his
former
and
his
then
present
life
.
<EOS>
There
he
stood
,
looking
down
once
more
at
the
numerous
irregular
roofs
,
the
many
stacks
of
chimneys
below
him
,
seeking
out
that
which
had
once
been
his
own
dwelling
 
who
dwelt
there
now
?
  
<EOS>
The
yellower
gleams
grew
narrower
;
the
evening
shadows
broader
,
and
Philip
crept
down
the
lane
a
weary
,
woeful
man
.
<EOS>
At
every
gap
in
the
close
-
packed
buildings
he
heard
the
merry
music
of
a
band
,
the
cheerful
sound
of
excited
voices
.
<EOS>
Still
he
descended
slowly
,
scarcely
wondering
what
it
could
be
,
for
it
was
not
associated
in
his
mind
with
the
one
pervading
thought
of
Sylvia
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
came
to
the
angle
of
junction
between
the
lane
and
the
High
Street
,
he
seemed
plunged
all
at
once
into
the
very
centre
of
the
bustle
,
and
he
drew
himself
up
into
a
corner
of
deep
shadow
,
from
whence
he
could
look
out
upon
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
A
circus
was
making
its
grand
entry
into
Monkshaven
,
with
all
the
pomp
of
colour
and
of
noise
that
it
could
muster
.
<EOS>
Trumpeters
in
parti
-
coloured
clothes
rode
first
,
blaring
out
triumphant
discord
.
<EOS>
Next
came
a
gold
-
and
-
scarlet
chariot
drawn
by
six
piebald
horses
,
and
the
windings
of
this
team
through
the
tortuous
narrow
street
were
pretty
enough
to
look
upon
.
<EOS>
In
the
chariot
sate
kings
and
queens
,
heroes
and
heroines
,
or
what
were
meant
for
such
;
all
the
little
boys
and
girls
running
alongside
of
the
chariot
envied
them
;
but
they
themselves
were
very
much
tired
,
and
shivering
with
cold
in
their
heroic
pomp
of
classic
clothing
.
<EOS>
All
this
Philip
might
have
seen
;
did
see
,
in
fact
;
but
heeded
not
one
jot
.
<EOS>
Almost
opposite
to
him
,
not
ten
yards
apart
,
standing
on
the
raised
step
at
the
well
-
known
shop
door
,
was
Sylvia
,
holding
a
child
,
a
merry
dancing
child
,
up
in
her
arms
to
see
the
show
.
<EOS>
She
too
,
Sylvia
,
was
laughing
for
pleasure
,
and
for
sympathy
with
pleasure
.
<EOS>
She
held
the
little
Bella
aloft
that
the
child
might
see
the
gaudy
procession
the
better
and
the
longer
,
looking
at
it
herself
with
red
lips
apart
and
white
teeth
glancing
through
;
then
she
turned
to
speak
to
some
one
behind
her
 
Coulson
,
as
Philip
saw
the
moment
afterwards
;
his
answer
made
her
laugh
once
again
.
<EOS>
Philip
saw
it
all
;
her
bonny
careless
looks
,
her
pretty
matronly
form
,
her
evident
ease
of
mind
and
prosperous
outward
circumstances
.
<EOS>
The
years
that
he
had
spent
in
gloomy
sorrow
,
amongst
wild
scenes
,
on
land
or
by
sea
,
his
life
in
frequent
peril
of
a
bloody
end
,
had
gone
by
with
her
like
sunny
days
;
all
the
more
sunny
because
he
was
not
there
.
<EOS>
So
bitterly
thought
the
poor
disabled
marine
,
as
,
weary
and
despairing
,
he
stood
in
the
cold
shadow
and
looked
upon
the
home
that
should
have
been
his
haven
,
the
wife
that
should
have
welcomed
him
,
the
child
that
should
have
been
his
comfort
.
<EOS>
He
had
banished
himself
from
his
home
;
his
wife
had
forsworn
him
;
his
child
was
blossoming
into
intelligence
unwitting
of
any
father
.
<EOS>
Wife
,
and
child
,
and
home
,
were
all
doing
well
without
him
;
what
madness
had
tempted
him
thither
?
<EOS>
an
hour
ago
,
like
a
fanciful
fool
,
he
had
thought
she
might
be
dead
 
dead
with
sad
penitence
for
her
cruel
words
at
her
heart
 
with
mournful
wonder
at
the
unaccounted
-
for
absence
of
her
child
's
father
preying
on
her
spirits
,
and
in
some
measure
causing
the
death
he
had
apprehended
.
<EOS>
But
to
look
at
her
there
where
she
stood
,
it
did
not
seem
as
if
she
had
had
an
hour
's
painful
thought
in
all
her
blooming
life
.
  
<EOS>
Ay
!
go
in
to
the
warm
hearth
,
mother
and
child
,
now
the
gay
cavalcade
has
gone
out
of
sight
,
and
the
chill
of
night
has
succeeded
to
the
sun
's
setting
.
<EOS>
Husband
and
father
,
steal
out
into
the
cold
dark
street
,
and
seek
some
poor
cheap
lodging
where
you
may
rest
your
weary
bones
,
and
cheat
your
more
weary
heart
into
forgetfulness
in
sleep
.
<EOS>
The
pretty
story
of
the
Countess
Phillis
,
who
mourned
for
her
husband
's
absence
so
long
,
is
a
fable
of
old
times
;
or
rather
say
Earl
Guy
never
wedded
his
wife
,
knowing
that
one
she
loved
better
than
him
was
alive
all
the
time
she
had
believed
him
to
be
dead
.
    
<EOS>
THE
UNKNOWN
  
<EOS>
A
few
days
before
that
on
which
Philip
arrived
at
Monkshaven
,
Kester
had
come
to
pay
Sylvia
a
visit
.
<EOS>
As
the
earliest
friend
she
had
,
and
also
as
one
who
knew
the
real
secrets
of
her
life
,
Sylvia
always
gave
him
the
warm
welcome
,
the
cordial
words
,
and
the
sweet
looks
in
which
the
old
man
delighted
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
sort
of
delicacy
of
his
own
which
kept
him
from
going
to
see
her
too
often
,
even
when
he
was
stationary
at
Monkshaven
;
but
he
looked
forward
to
the
times
when
he
allowed
himself
this
pleasure
as
a
child
at
school
looks
forward
to
its
holidays
.
<EOS>
The
time
of
his
service
at
Haytersbank
had
,
on
the
whole
,
been
the
happiest
in
all
his
long
monotonous
years
of
daily
labour
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
's
father
had
always
treated
him
with
the
rough
kindness
of
fellowship
;
Sylvia
's
mother
had
never
stinted
him
in
his
meat
or
grudged
him
his
share
of
the
best
that
was
going
;
and
once
,
when
he
was
ill
for
a
few
days
in
the
loft
above
the
cow
-
house
,
she
had
made
him
possets
,
and
nursed
him
with
the
same
tenderness
which
he
remembered
his
mother
showing
to
him
when
he
was
a
little
child
,
but
which
he
had
never
experienced
since
then
.
<EOS>
He
had
known
Sylvia
herself
,
as
bud
,
and
sweet
promise
of
blossom
;
and
just
as
she
was
opening
into
the
full
-
blown
rose
,
and
,
if
she
had
been
happy
and
prosperous
,
might
have
passed
out
of
the
narrow
circle
of
Kester
's
interests
,
one
sorrow
after
another
came
down
upon
her
pretty
innocent
head
,
and
Kester
's
period
of
service
to
Daniel
Robson
,
her
father
,
was
tragically
cut
short
.
<EOS>
All
this
made
Sylvia
the
great
centre
of
the
faithful
herdsman
's
affection
;
and
Bella
,
who
reminded
him
of
what
Sylvia
was
when
first
Kester
knew
her
,
only
occupied
the
second
place
in
his
heart
,
although
to
the
child
he
was
much
more
demonstrative
of
his
regard
than
to
the
mother
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
dressed
himself
in
his
Sunday
best
,
and
although
it
was
only
Thursday
,
had
forestalled
his
Saturday
's
shaving
;
he
had
provided
himself
with
a
paper
of
humbugs
for
the
child
 
<EOS>
"
humbugs
"
being
the
north
-
country
term
for
certain
lumps
of
toffy
,
well
-
flavoured
with
peppermint
 
<EOS>
and
now
he
sat
in
the
accustomed
chair
,
as
near
to
the
door
as
might
be
,
in
Sylvia
's
presence
,
coaxing
the
little
one
,
who
was
not
quite
sure
of
his
identity
,
to
come
to
him
,
by
opening
the
paper
parcel
,
and
letting
its
sweet
contents
be
seen
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
like
thee
 
<EOS>
and
yet
she
favours
her
feyther
,
"
said
he
;
and
the
moment
he
had
uttered
the
incautious
words
he
looked
up
to
see
how
Sylvia
had
taken
the
unpremeditated
,
unusual
reference
to
her
husband
.
<EOS>
His
stealthy
glance
did
not
meet
her
eye
;
but
though
he
thought
she
had
coloured
a
little
,
she
did
not
seem
offended
as
he
had
feared
.
<EOS>
It
was
true
that
Bella
had
her
father
's
grave
,
thoughtful
,
dark
eyes
,
instead
of
her
mother
's
gray
ones
,
out
of
which
the
childlike
expression
of
wonder
would
never
entirely
pass
away
.
<EOS>
And
as
Bella
slowly
and
half
distrustfully
made
her
way
towards
the
temptation
offered
her
,
she
looked
at
Kester
with
just
her
father
's
look
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
said
nothing
in
direct
reply
;
Kester
almost
thought
she
could
not
have
heard
him
.
<EOS>
But
,
by
-
and
-
by
,
she
said
,
    
"
Yo'll
have
heared
how
Kinraid
 
<EOS>
who
's
a
captain
now
,
and
a
grand
officer
 
has
gone
and
got
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
!
"
said
Kester
,
in
genuine
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
niver
has
,
for
sure
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
but
he
has
,
"
said
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
'm
sure
I
dunnot
see
why
he
should
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
!
"
said
Kester
,
not
looking
up
at
her
,
for
he
caught
the
inflections
in
the
tones
of
her
voice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
were
a
fine
stirrin
'
chap
,
yon
;
an
'
he
were
allays
for
doin'
summut
;
an
'
when
he
fund
as

could

thing
as
he
'd
set
his
mind
on
,
a
reckon
he
thought

another
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
'
ud
be
no
"
putting
up
,
"
"
said
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
"
She
were
staying
at
Bessy
Dawson
's
,
and
she
come
here
to
see
me
 
<EOS>
she
's
as
pretty
a
young

as
yo'd

on

day

and
a
real

,
too
,
wi

<EOS>
She
did
n't
speak
two
words
<EOS>
wi'out

bringing
in

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
An

"
said
Kester
,
cocking
his
eye
at
Sylvia
with
the
old
shrewd
look
.
<EOS>
"
That
were
summut
queer
,
were
n't
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
reddened
a
good
deal
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
too
fause
to
have
spoken
to
her
on
me
,
in
t
'
old
way
,
 
as
he
used
for
t

speak
to
me

<EOS>
I
were
nought
to
her
<EOS>
but
Philip

wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
An
'
what
t
'
dickins
had
she
to
do
wi
'
Philip
?
"
asked
Kester
,
in
intense
surprise
;
and
so
absorbed
in
curiosity
that
he
let
the
humbugs
all
fall
out
of
the
paper
upon
the
floor
,
and
the
little
Bella
sat
down
,
plump
,
in
the
midst
of
treasures
as
great
as
those
fabled
to
exist
on
Tom
Tiddler
's
ground
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
was
again
silent
;
but
Kester
,
knowing
her
well
<EOS>
,
was
sure
that
she
was
struggling
to
speak
,
and
bided
his
time
without
repeating
his
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
said
 
<EOS>
and
I
think
her
tale
were
true
,
though
I
can
not
get
to
t
'
rights
on
it
,
think
on
it
as
I
will
 
as
Philip
saved
her
husband
's
life
somewheere
nearabouts
to
Jerusalem
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
it
that
t

captain
 
<EOS>
for
I
think
I
'll
niver
ca
'
<EOS>
him
Kinraid
<EOS>
again
 
was
in
a
great
battle

and
were
near

when
Philip

up

went
right
into
t

fire
o
'
t

guns
,
and
saved
her
husband

life

<EOS>
And
she
spoke
as
if
both
she
and
t
'
captain
were
more
beholden
to
Philip
than
words
could
tell
.
<EOS>
And
she
come
to
see
me
,
to
try
and
get
news
on
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
queer
kind
o

story

said
Kester
,
meditatively
.
<EOS>
"
A
should
ha
'
thought
as
Philip
were
more
likely
to
ha
'
gi'en
him
a
shove
into
t
'
thick
on
it
,
than
t
'
help
him
out
o
'
t
'
scrape
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
!
"
said
Sylvia
,
suddenly
looking
straight
at
Kester
;
"
yo're
out
theere
.
<EOS>
Philip
had
a
deal
o
'
good
in
him
.
<EOS>
And
I
dunnot
think
as
he
'd
ha
'
gone
and
married
another
woman
so
soon
,
if
he
'd
been
i
'
Kinraid
's
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
An
'
yo've
niver
heared
on
Philip
sin
'
he
left
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Kester
,
after
a
while
.
  
<EOS>
"
Niver
;
nought
but
what
she
told
me
.
<EOS>
And
she
said
that
t
'
captain
made
inquiry
for
him
right
and
left
,
as
soon
after
that
happened
as
might
be
,
and
could
hear
niver
a
word
about
him
.
<EOS>
No
one
had
seen
him
,
or
knowed
his
name
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yo
'
niver
heared
of
his
goin'
for
t
'
be
a
soldier
?
"
<EOS>
persevered
Kester
.
  
<EOS>
"
Niver
.
<EOS>
I
've
told
yo
'
once
.
<EOS>
It
were
unlike
Philip
to
think
o
'
such
a
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
thou
mun
ha
'
been
thinkin
'
on
him
at
times
<EOS>
i
'
a
'
these
years
.
<EOS>
Bad
as
he
'd
behaved
hissel
'
,
he
were
t
'
feyther
o
'
thy
little
un
.
<EOS>
What
did
ta
think
he
had
been
agait
on
when
he
left
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
know
.
<EOS>
I
were
noane
so
keen
a
-
thinking
on
him
at
first
.
<EOS>
I
tried
to
put
him
out
o
'
my
thoughts
a'together
,
for
it
made
me
like
mad
to
think
how
he
'd
stood
between
me
and
 
that
other
.
<EOS>
But
I
'd
begun
to
wonder
and
to
wonder
about
him
,
and
to
think
I
should
like
to
hear
as
he
were
doing
well
.
<EOS>
I
reckon
I
thought
he
were
i
'
London
<EOS>
,
wheere
he
'd
been
<EOS>
that
time
afore
,
yo
'
know
,
and
had
allays
spoke
as
if
he
'd
enjoyed
hissel
'
tolerable
;
and
then
Molly
Brunton
told
me
on
t
'
other
one
's
marriage
;
and
,
somehow
,
it
gave
me
a
shake
in
my
heart
,
and
I
began
for
to
wish
I
had
n't
said
all
them
words
<EOS>
i
'
my
passion
;
and
then
that
fine
young
lady
come
wi
'
her
story
 
<EOS>
and
I
've
thought
a
deal
on
it
since
,
 
and
<EOS>
my
mind
has
come
out
clear
.
<EOS>
Philip
's
dead
,
and
it
were
his
spirit
as
come
to
t
'
other
's
help
in
his
time
<EOS>
o
'
need
.
<EOS>
I
've
heard
feyther
say
as
spirits
can
not
rest
i
'
their
graves
for
trying
to
undo
t
'
wrongs
they
've
done
<EOS>
i
'
their
bodies
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Them
's
my
conclusions
,
"
said
Kester
,
solemnly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
was
fain
for
to
hear
what
were
yo'r
judgments
first
;
but
them
's
the
conclusions
I
comed
to
as
soon
as
I
heard
t
'
tale
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
alone
that
one
thing
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
"
he
were
a
kind
,
good
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
were
a
big

on

one
thing
"
,

"
said
Kester
.
<EOS>
"
It
just
spoilt

<EOS>

Men

bitterly

"
Not

I

Philip

pretty
well
on

at
after

a

soon

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
'd
just
had
a
few
kind
words
wi

him
,
I
do
,
"
said
Sylvia
,
almost
on
the
point
of
crying
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
lass

,
it
's
as
ill
moanin

Why

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
a
sad
spoilt
little
puss
!
"
<EOS>
said
Sylvia
,
holding
out
her
arms
to
the
child
,
who
ran
into
them
,
and
began
patting
her
mother
's
cheeks
,
and
pulling
at
the
soft
brown
curls
tucked
away
beneath
the
matronly
cap
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mammy
spoils
her
,
and
Hester
spoils
her
   
'
  
<EOS>
"
Granny
Rose
does
n't
spoil
me
,
"
said
the
child
,
with
quick
,
intelligent
discrimination
,
interrupting
her
mother
's
list
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
but
Jeremiah
Foster
does
above
a
bit
.
<EOS>
He
'll
come
in
fro
'
t
'
Bank
,
Kester
,
and
ask
for
her
,
a'most
ivery
day
.
<EOS>
And
he
'll
bring
her
things
in
his
pocket
;
and
she
's
so
fause
<EOS>
,
she
allays
goes
straight
to
peep
in
,
and
then
he
shifts
t
'
apple
or
t
'
toy
into
another
.
<EOS>
Eh
!
<EOS>
but
she
's
a
little
fause
one
,
"
 
half
devouring
the
child
with
her
kisses
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
comes
and
takes
her
a
walk
oftentimes
,
and
he
goes
as
slow
as
if
he
were
quite
an
old
man
,
to
keep
pace
wi
'
Bella
's
steps
.
<EOS>
I
often
run
upstairs
and
watch
'em
out
o
'
t
'
window
;
he
does
n't
care
to
have
me
with

he
's
so
fain

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
a
bonny
un
,
for
sure
,
"
said
Kester
;
"
but
not
so
pretty
as
thou
was
,
Sylvie

<EOS>
A've

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
'll
be
a
nice
time
o

year

"
said
Sylvia
,
a
little
surprised
at
Kester
's
evident
discouragement
at
the
prospect
of
the
journey
or
absence
;
he
had
often
been
away
from
Monkshaven
for
a
longer
time
without
seeming
to
care
so
much
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
yo
'
see
it
's
a
bit
hard
upon
me
for

an

there

<EOS>
an

sadly
down

i

,
for
she
can
not

for

new

an

t

grand

<EOS>
they
're
makin

round

,
thinkin
'
she
'd
be
<EOS>
likelier
t
'
pick
up
a
labourer
as
would
be
glad
on
a
bed
near
his
work
.
<EOS>
A'd
ha
'
liked
to
ha
'
set
her
agait
<EOS>
wi
'
<EOS>
a
'
sponsible
lodger
afore
a'd
ha
'
left
<EOS>
,
for
she
's
just
so
soft
-
hearted
,
any
scamp
may
put
upon
her
if
he
nobbut
gets
houd
on
her
blind
side
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
I
help
her
?
"
said
Sylvia
,
in
her
eager
way
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
so
glad
;
and
I
've
a
deal
of
money
by
me
   
<EOS>
'
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
my
lass
,
"
said
Kester
,
"
thou
munnot
go
off
so
fast
<EOS>
;
it
were
just
what
I
were
feared
on
i
'
tellin
'
thee
.
<EOS>
I
've
left
her
a
bit
o
'
money
,
and
I
'll
mak
'
shift
to
send
her
more
;
it
's
just
a
kind
word
,
t
'
keep
up
her
heart
when
I
'm
gone
,
as
I
want
.
<EOS>
If
thou'd
step
in
and
see
her
fra
'
time
to
time
,
and
cheer
her
up
a
bit
wi
'
talkin
'
to
her
on
me
,
I
'd
tak
'
it
very
kind
,
and
I
'd
go
off
wi
'
a
lighter
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
'm
sure
I
'll
do
it
for
yo
'
,
Kester
.
<EOS>
I
niver
justly
feel
like
mysel
'
when
yo're
away
,
for
I
'm
lonesome
enough
at
times
.
<EOS>
She
and
I
will
talk
a
'
t
'
better
about
yo
'
for
both
on
us
grieving
after
yo
'
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
Kester
took
his
leave
<EOS>
,
his
mind
set
at
ease
by
Sylvia
's
promise
to
go
and
see
his
sister
pretty
often
during
his
absence
in
the
North
.
  
<EOS>
But
Sylvia
's
habits
were
changed
since
she
,
as
a
girl
at
Haytersbank
,
liked
to
spend
half
her
time
in
the
open
air
,
<EOS>
running
out
perpetually
without
anything
on
to
scatter
crumbs
to
the
poultry
,
or
to
take
a
piece
of
bread
to
the
old
cart
-
horse
,
to
go
up
to
the
garden
for
a
handful
of
herbs
,
or
to
clamber
to
the
highest
point
around
to
blow
the
horn
which
summoned
her
father
and
Kester
home
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
Living
in
a
town
where
it
was
necessary
to
put
on
hat
and
cloak
before
going
out
into
the
street
,
and
then
to
walk
in
a
steady
and
decorous
fashion
,
she
had
only
cared
to
escape
down
to
the
freedom
of
the
sea
-
shore
until
Philip
went
away
;
and
after
that
time
she
had
learnt
so
to
fear
observation
as
a
deserted
wife
,
that
nothing
but
Bella
's
health
would
have
been
a
sufficient
motive
to
take
her
out
of
doors
.
<EOS>
And
,
as
she
had
told
Kester
,
the
necessity
of
giving
the
little
girl
a
daily
walk
was
very
much
lightened
by
the
great
love
and
affection
which
Jeremiah
Foster
now
bore
to
the
child
.
<EOS>
Ever
since
the
day
when
the
baby
had
come
to
his
knee
,
allured
by
the
temptation
of
his
watch
,
he
had
apparently
considered
her
as
in
some
sort
belonging
to
him
;
and
now
he
had
almost
come
to
think
that
he
had
a
right
to
claim
her
as
his
companion
in
his
walk
back
from
the
Bank
to
his
early
dinner
,
where
a
high
chair
was
always
placed
ready
for
the
chance
of
her
coming
to
share
his
meal
.
<EOS>
On
these
occasions
he
generally
brought
her
back
to
the
shop
-
door
when
he
returned
to
his
afternoon
's
work
at
the
Bank
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
however
,
he
would
leave
word
that
she
was
to
be
sent
for
from
his
house
in
the
New
Town
,
as
his
business
at
the
Bank
for
that
day
was
ended
.
<EOS>
Then
Sylvia
was
compelled
to
put
on
her
things
,
and
fetch
back
her
darling
;
and
excepting
for
this
errand
she
seldom
went
out
at
all
on
week
-
days
.
  
<EOS>
About
a
fortnight
after
Kester
's
farewell
call
,
this
need
for
her
visit
to
<EOS>
Jeremiah
Foster
's
arose
;
and
it
seemed
to
Sylvia
that
there
could
not
be
a
better
opportunity
of
fulfilling
her
promise
and
going
to
see
the
widow
Dobson
,
whose
cottage
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
,
low
down
on
the
cliff
-
side
,
just
at
the
bend
and
rush
of
the
full
stream
into
the
open
sea
.
<EOS>
She
set
off
pretty
early
in
order
to
go
there
first
.
<EOS>
She
found
the
widow
with
her
house
-
place
tidied
up
after
the
midday
meal
,
and
busy
knitting
at
the
open
door
 
not
looking
at
her
rapid
-
clicking
needles
,
but
gazing
at
the
rush
and
recession
of
the
waves
before
her
;
yet
not
seeing
them
either
,
 
rather
seeing
days
long
past
.
  
<EOS>
She
started
into
active
civility
as
soon
as
she
recognized
Sylvia
,
who
was
to
her
as
a
great
lady
,
never
having
known
Sylvia
Robson
in
her
wild
childish
days
.
<EOS>
Widow
Dobson
was
always
a
little
scandalized
at
her
brother
Christopher
's
familiarity
with
Mrs.
Hepburn
.
  
<EOS>
She
dusted
a
chair
which
needed
no
dusting
,
and
placed
it
for
Sylvia
,
sitting
down
herself
on
a
three
-
legged
stool
to
mark
her
sense
of
the
difference
in
their
conditions
,
for
there
was
another
chair
or
two
in
the
humble
dwelling
;
and
then
the
two
fell
into
talk
 
first
about
Kester
,
whom
his
sister
would
persist
in
calling
Christopher
,
as
if
his
dignity
as
her
elder
brother
was
compromised
by
any
familiar
abbreviation
;
and
by
-
and
<EOS>
-
by
she
opened
her
heart
a
little
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
could
wish
as
a'd
learned
write
-
of
-
hand
,
"
said
she
;
"
for
a've
that
for
to
tell
Christopher
as
might
set
his
mind
at
ease
.
<EOS>
But
yo
'
see
,
if
a
wrote
him
a
letter
he
could
n't
read
it
;
so
a
just
comfort
mysel
'
wi
'
thinkin
'
nobody
need
learn
writin
'
unless
they'n
got
friends
as
can
read
.
<EOS>
But
a
reckon
he
'd
ha
'
been
glad
to
hear
as
a've
getten
a
lodger
.
<EOS>
"
Here
she
nodded
her
head
in
the
direction
of
the
door
opening
out
of
the
house
-
place
into
the
"
lean
-
to
"
,
which
Sylvia
had
observed
on
drawing
near
the
cottage
,
and
the
recollection
of
the
mention
of
which
by
Kester
had
enabled
her
to
identify
widow
Dobson
's
dwelling
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
a
-
bed
yonder
,
"
the
latter
continued
,
dropping
her
voice
.
"
<EOS>
He
's
a
queer
-
lookin
'
tyke
,
but
a
do
n't
think
as
he
's
a
bad
un
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
did
he
come
?
"
said
Sylvia
,
remembering
Kester
's
account
of
his
sister
's
character
,
and
feeling
as
though
it
behoved
her
,
as
Kester
's
confidante
on
this
head
,
to
give
cautious
and
prudent
advice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
!
a
matter
of
a
s'ennight
ago
.
<EOS>
A'm
noane
good
at
mindin
'
time
;
he
's
paid
me
his
rent
twice
,
but
then
he
were
keen
to
pay
aforehand
.
<EOS>
He
'd
comed
in
one
night
,
an
'
sate
him
down
afore
<EOS>
he
could
speak
,
he
were
so
done
up
;
he
'd
been
on
tramp
this
many
a
day
,
a
reckon
.
"
<EOS>
Can
yo
'
give
me
a
bed
?
"
<EOS>
says
he
,
panting
like
,
after
a
bit
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
chap
as
a
met
near
here
says
as
yo've
a
lodging
for
t
'
let
.
"
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
"
says
a
,
"
a
ha
'
that
;
but
yo
'
mun
pay
me
a
shilling
a
week
for
'
t.
<EOS>
"
Then
my
mind
misgive
me
,
for
a
thought
he
had
n't
a
shilling
i
<EOS>
'
t
'
world
,
an
'
yet
if
he
had
n't
,
a
should
just
ha
'
gi'en
him
t
'
bed
a
'
t
'
same
:
a'm
not
one
as
can
turn
a
dog
out
if
he
comes
t
'
<EOS>
me
wearied
o
'
his
life
.
<EOS>
So
he
outs
wi
'
a
shillin
'
,
an
'
lays
it
down
on
t
'
table
,
"
bout
a
word
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A'll
not
trouble
yo
'
long
,
"
says
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A'm
one
as
is
best
out
o
'
t
'
world
,
"
he
says
.
<EOS>
Then
a
thought
as
a'd
been
a
bit
hard
upon
him
.
<EOS>
An
'
says
I
,
"
A'm
a
widow
-
woman
,
and
one
as
has
getten
but
few
friends
:
"
for
yo
'
see
a
were
low
about
our
Christopher
's
goin'
away
north
;
"
so
a'm
forced
-
like
to
speak
hard
to
folk
;
but
a've
made
mysel
'
some
stirabout
for
my
supper
;
and
if
yo'd
like
t
'
share
an
'
share
about
wi
'
me
<EOS>
,
it
's
but
<EOS>
puttin
'
a
sup
more
watter
to
'
t
,
and
God
's
blessing
'll
be
on
'
t
,
just
as
same
as
if
'
t
were
meal
.
"
<EOS>
So
he
ups
wi
'
his
hand
afore
his
e'en
,
and
says
not
a
word
.
<EOS>
At
last
he
says
,
"
Missus
,
"
says
he
,
"
can
God
's
blessing
be
shared
by
a
sinner
 
<EOS>
one
o
'
t
'
devil
's
children
?
"
says
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
the
Scriptur
'
says
he
's
t
'
father
o
'
lies
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
a
were
puzzled
-
like
<EOS>
;
an
'
at
length
a
says
,
"
Thou
mun
ask
t
'
parson
that
;
a'm
but
a
poor
faint
-
hearted
widow
-
woman
;
but
a've
allays
had
God
's
blessing
somehow
,
now
a
bethink
me
,
an
'
a'll
share
it
wi
'
thee
as
far
as
my
will
goes
.
"
<EOS>
So
he
raxes
his
hand
across
t
'
table
,
an
'
mutters
summat
,
as
he
grips
mine
.
<EOS>
A
thought
it
were
Scriptur
'
as
he
said
,
but
a'd
needed
a
'
my
strength
just
then
for
t
'
lift
t
'
pot
off
t
'
fire
 
<EOS>
it
were
t
'
first
vittle
a'd
tasted
sin
'
morn
,
for
t
'
famine
comes
down
like
stones
on
t
'
head
<EOS>
o
'
us
poor
folk
:
an
'
a
'
a
said
were
just
"
Coom

,
an
'
fa
'
to

an
'
God
's
blessing
be
on
him
as
eats
most
.
"
<EOS>
An
'
sin
'
that
day
him
and
me
's
been
as
thick
as
thieves
,
only
he
's
niver
telled
me
nought
of
who
he
is
,
or
wheere
he
comes
fra
'
.
<EOS>
But
a
think
he
's
one
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
them
poor
colliers
,
as
has
getten
brunt
<EOS>
i
'
t
'
coal
-
pits
;
for
,
t
'
be
sure
<EOS>
,
his
face
is
a
'
black
wi
'
fire
-
marks
;
an
'
o
'
late
days
he
's
ta'en
t
'
his
bed
,
an
'
just
lies
there
sighing
,
 
for
one
can
hear
him
plain
as
dayleet
thro
'
t
'
bit
partition
wa
'
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
a
proof
of
this
,
a
sigh
 
almost
a
groan
 
startled
the
two
women
at
this
very
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
fellow
!
"
said
Sylvia
,
in
a
soft
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
more
sore
hearts
<EOS>
i
'
t
'
world
than
one
reckons
for
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
after
a
while
,
she
bethought
her
again
of
Kester
's
account
of
his
sister
's
"
softness
"
;
and
she
thought
that
it
behoved
her
to
give
some
good
advice
.
<EOS>
So
she
added
,
in
a
sterner
,
harder
tone
 
<EOS>
"
Still
,
yo
'
say
yo
'
know
nought
about
him
;
and
tramps
is
tramps
a
'
t
'
world
over
;
and
yo're
a
widow
,
and
it
behoves
yo
'
to
be
careful
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
'd
just
send
him
off
as
soon
as
he
's
a
bit
rested
.
<EOS>
Yo
'
say
he
's
<EOS>
plenty
o
'
money
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Nay
!
<EOS>
A
never
said
that
.
<EOS>
A
know
nought
about
it
.
<EOS>
He
pays
me
aforehand
;
an
'
he
pays
me
down
for
whativer
a've
getten
for
him
;
but
that
's
but
little
<EOS>
;
he
's
noane
up
t
'
his
vittle
,
though
a've
made
him
some
broth
as
good
as
a
could
make

em

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
n't
send
him
away
till
he
was
well
again
,
if
I
were
yo
;
but
I
think
yo'd
be
better
rid
on
him
,
"
said
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
different
if
yo'r
brother
were
in
Monkshaven
.
"
<EOS>
As
she
spoke
she
rose
to
go
.
  
<EOS>
Widow
Dobson
held
her
hand
in
hers
for
a
minute
,
then
the
humble
woman
said
,
    
"
Yo'll
noane
be
vexed
wi
'
me
,
missus

if

<EOS>
my

?
<EOS>
For
a
would
n't
like
to
vex
yo
'
,
for
Christopher
's
sake
;
but
a
know
what
it
is
for
t
'
feel
for
friendless
folk
,
an
'
choose
what

come
on

I
can
not

away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No

"
said
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
"
Why
should
I
be
vexed
?
<EOS>
it
's
no
business
o
'
mine
.
<EOS>
Only
I
should
send
him
away
if
I
was
yo

.
<EOS>
He
might
go
lodge
wheere
there
was
men
-
folk
,
who
know
t
'
ways
o
'
tramps
,
and
are
up
to
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
Into
the
sunshine
went
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
In
the
cold
shadow
the
miserable
tramp
lay
sighing
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
know
that
she
had
been
so
near
to
him
towards
whom
her
heart
was
softening
,
day
by
day
.
    
<EOS>
FIRST
WORDS
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
spring
of
1800
.
<EOS>
Old
people
yet
can
tell
of
the
hard
famine
of
that
year
.
<EOS>
The
harvest
of
the
autumn
before
had
failed
;
the
war
and
the
corn
laws
had
brought
the
price
of
corn
up
to
a
famine
rate
;
and
much
of
what
came
into
the
market
was
unsound
,
and
consequently
unfit
for
food
,
yet
hungry
creatures
bought
it
eagerly
,
and
tried
to
cheat
disease
by
mixing
the
damp
,
sweet
,
clammy
flour
with
rice
or
potato
meal
.
<EOS>
Rich
families
denied
themselves
pastry
and
all
unnecessary
and
luxurious
uses
of
wheat
in
any
shape
;
the
duty
on
hair
-
powder
was
increased
;
and
all
these
palliatives
were
but
as
drops
in
the
ocean
of
the
great
want
of
the
people
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
,
in
spite
of
himself
,
recovered
and
grew
stronger
;
and
as
he
grew
stronger
hunger
took
the
place
of
loathing
dislike
to
food
.
<EOS>
But
his
money
was
all
spent
;
and
what
was
his
poor
pension
of
sixpence
a
day
in
that
terrible
year
of
famine
?
<EOS>
Many
a
summer
's
night
he
walked
for
hours
and
hours
round
the
house
which
once
was
his
,
which
might
be
his
now
,
with
all
its
homely
,
blessed
comforts
,
<EOS>
could
he
but
go
and
assert
his
right
to
it
.
<EOS>
But
to
go
with
authority
,
and
in
his
poor
,
maimed
guise
assert
that
right
<EOS>
,
he
had
need
be
other
than
Philip
Hepburn
.
<EOS>
So
he
stood
in
the
old
shelter
of
the
steep
,
crooked
lane
opening
on
to
the
hill
out
of
the
market
-
place
,
and
watched
the
soft
fading
of
the
summer
's
eve
into
night
;
the
closing
of
the
once
familiar
shop
;
the
exit
of
good
,
comfortable
William
Coulson
,
going
to
his
own
home
,
his
own
wife
,
his
comfortable
,
plentiful
supper
.
<EOS>
Then
Philip
 
there
were
no
police
in
those
days
,
and
scarcely
an
old
watchman
in
that
primitive
little
town
 
would
go
round
on
the
shady
sides
of
streets
,
and
,
quickly
glancing
about
him
,
cross
the
bridge
,
looking
on
the
quiet
,
rippling
stream
,
<EOS>
the
gray
shimmer
foretelling
the
coming
dawn
over
the
sea
,
the
black
masts
and
rigging
of
the
still
vessels
against
the
sky
<EOS>
;
he
could
see
with
his
wistful
,
eager
eyes
the
shape
of
the
windows
 
the
window
of
the
very
room
in
which
his
wife
and
child
slept
,
unheeding
of
him
,
the
hungry
,
broken
-
hearted
outcast
.
<EOS>
He
would
go
back
to
his
lodging
,
and
softly
lift
the
latch
of
the
door
;
still
more
softly
,
but
never
without
an
unspoken
,
grateful
prayer
,
pass
by
the
poor
sleeping
woman
who
had
given
him
a
shelter
and
her
share
of
God
's
blessing
 
she
who
,
like
him
,
knew
not
the
feeling
of
satisfied
hunger
;
and
then
he
laid
him
down
on
the
narrow
pallet
in
the
lean
-
to
,
and
again
gave
Sylvia
happy
lessons
in
the
kitchen
at
Haytersbank
,
and
the
dead
were
alive
;
and
Charley
Kinraid
,
the
specksioneer
,
had
never
come
to
trouble
the
hopeful
,
gentle
peace
.
  
<EOS>
For
widow
Dobson
had
never
taken
Sylvia
's
advice
.
<EOS>
The
tramp
known
to
her
by
the
name
of
Freeman
 
that
in
which
he
received
his
pension
 
lodged
with
her
still
,
and
paid
his
meagre
shilling
in
advance
,
weekly
.
<EOS>
A
shilling
was
meagre
in
those
hard
days
of
scarcity
.
<EOS>
A
hungry
man
might
easily
eat
the
produce
of
a
shilling
in
a
day
.
  
<EOS>
Widow
Dobson
pleaded
this
to
Sylvia
as
an
excuse
for
keeping
her
lodger
on
;
to
a
more
calculating
head
it
might
have
seemed
a
reason
for
sending
him
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yo
'
see
,
missus
,
"
said
she
,
apologetically
,
to
Sylvia
,
one
evening
,
as
the
latter
called
upon
the
poor
widow
before
going
to
fetch
little
Bella
(
it
was
now
too
hot
for
the
child
to
cross
the
bridge
in
the
full
heat
of
the
summer
sun
,
and
Jeremiah
would
take
her
up
to
her
supper
instead
)
 
<EOS>
"
Yo
'
see
,
missus
<EOS>
,
there
's
not
a
many
as
'
ud
take
him
in
for
a
shillin
'
when
it
goes
so
little
way
;
or
if
they
did
,
they
'd
take
it
out
on
him
some
other
way
,
an
'
he
's
not
getten
much
else
,
a
reckon
.
<EOS>
He
ca
's
me
granny
,
but
a'm
vast
mista'en
<EOS>
if
he
's
ten
year
younger
nor
me
;
but
he
's
getten
a
fine
appetite
of
his
own
,
choose
how
young
he
may
be
;
an
'
a
can
see
as
he
could
eat
a
deal
more
nor
he
's
getten
money
to
buy
,
an
'
it
's
few
as
can
mak
'
victual
go
farther
nor
me
.
<EOS>
Eh
,
missus
,
but
yo
'
may
trust
me
a'll
send
him
off
when
times
is
better
;
but
just
now
it
would
be
sendin
'
him
to
his
death
;
for
a
ha
'
plenty
and
to
spare
,
thanks
be
to
God
an
'
yo'r
bonny
face
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
Sylvia
had
to
be
content
with
the
knowledge
that
the
money
she
gladly
gave
to
Kester
's
sister
went
partly
to
feed
the
lodger
who
was
neither
labourer
nor
neighbour
,
but
only
just
a
tramp
,
who
,
she
feared
,
was
preying
on
the
good
old
woman
.
<EOS>
Still
the
cruel
famine
cut
sharp
enough
to
penetrate
all
hearts
;
and
Sylvia
,
an
hour
after
the
conversation
recorded
above
,
was
much
touched
,
on
her
return
from
Jeremiah
Foster
's
with
the
little
merry
,
chattering
Bella
,
at
seeing
the
feeble
steps
of
one
,
whom
she
knew
by
description
must
be
widow
Dobson
's
lodger
,
turn
up
from
the
newly
-
cut
road
which
was
to
lead
to
<EOS>
the
terrace
walk
around
the
North
Cliff
,
a
road
which
led
to
no
dwelling
but
<EOS>
widow
Dobson
's
.
<EOS>
Tramp
,
and
vagrant
,
he
might
be
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
;
but
,
whatever
his
character
,
Sylvia
could
see
him
before
her
in
the
soft
dusk
,
creeping
along
,
over
the
bridge
,
often
stopping
to
rest
and
hold
by
some
support
,
and
then
going
on
again
towards
the
town
,
to
which
she
and
happy
little
Bella
were
wending
.
  
<EOS>
A
thought
came
over
her
:
she
had
always
fancied
that
this
unknown
man
was
some
fierce
vagabond
,
and
had
dreaded
lest
in
the
lonely
bit
of
road
between
widow
Dobson
's
cottage
and
the
peopled
highway
,
he
should
fall
upon
her
and
rob
her
if
he
learnt
that
she
had
money
with
her
;
and
several
times
she
had
gone
away
without
leaving
the
little
gift
she
had
intended
,
because
she
imagined
that
she
had
seen
the
door
of
the
small
chamber
in
the
"
lean
-
to
"
open
softly
while
she
was
there
,
as
if
the
occupant
(
whom
widow
Dobson
spoke
of
as
never
leaving
the
house
before
dusk
,
excepting
once
a
week
)
were
listening
for
the
chink
of
the
coin
in
her
little
leathern
purse
.
<EOS>
Now
that
she
saw
him
walking
before
her
with
heavy
languid
steps
,
this
fear
gave
place
to
pity
;
she
remembered
her
mother
's
gentle
superstition
which
had
prevented
her
from
ever
sending
the
hungry
empty
away
,
for
fear
lest
she
herself
should
come
to
need
bread
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lassie
,
"
said
she
to
little
Bella
,
who
held
a
cake
which
Jeremiah
's
housekeeper
had
given
her
tight
in
her
hand
,
"
yon
poor
man
theere
is
hungry
;
will
Bella
give
him
her
cake
,
and
mother
will
make
her
another
to
-
morrow
twice
as
big
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
For
this
consideration
,
and
with
the
feeling
of
satisfaction
which
a
good
supper
not
an
hour
ago
gives
even
to
the
hungry
stomach
of
a
child
of
three
years
old
,
Bella
,
after
some
thought
,
graciously
assented
to
the
sacrifice
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
stopped
,
the
cake
in
her
hand
,
and
turned
her
back
to
the
town
,
and
to
the
slow
wayfarer
in
front
.
<EOS>
Under
the
cover
of
her
shawl
she
slipped
a
half
-
crown
deep
into
the
crumb
of
the
cake
,
and
then
restoring
it
to
little
Bella
,
she
gave
her
her
directions
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mammy
will
carry
Bella
;
and
when
Bella
goes
past
the
poor
man
,
she
shall
give
him
the
cake
over
mammy
's
shoulder
.
<EOS>
Poor
man
is
so
hungry
;
and
Bella
and
mammy
have
plenty
to
eat
,
and
to
spare
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
child
's
heart
was
touched
by
the
idea
of
hunger
,
and
her
little
arm
was
outstretched
ready
for
the
moment
her
mother
's
hurried
steps
took
her
brushing
past
the
startled
,
trembling
Philip
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
man
,
eat
this
;
Bella
not
hungry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
the
first
words
he
had
ever
heard
his
child
utter
.
<EOS>
The
echoes
of
them
rang
in
his
ears
as
he
stood
endeavouring
to
hide
his
disfigured
face
by
looking
over
the
parapet
of
the
bridge
down
upon
the
stream
running
away
towards
the
ocean
,
into
which
his
hot
tears
slowly
fell
,
unheeded
by
the
weeper
.
<EOS>
Then
he
changed
the
intention
with
which
he
had
set
out
upon
his
nightly
walk
,
and
turned
back
to
his
lodging
.
  
<EOS>
Of
course
the
case
was
different
with
Sylvia
;
she
would
have
forgotten
the
whole
affair
very
speedily
,
if
it
had
not
been
for
little
Bella
's
frequent
recurrence
to
the
story
of
the
hungry
man
,
which
had
touched
her
small
sympathies
with
the
sense
of
an
intelligible
misfortune
.
<EOS>
She
liked
to
act
the
dropping
of
the
bun
into
the
poor
man
's
hand
as
she
went
past
him
,
and
would
take
up
any
article
near
her
in
order
to
illustrate
the
gesture
she
had
used
.
<EOS>
One
day
she
got
hold
of
Hester
's
watch
for
this
purpose
,
as
being
of
the
same
round
shape
as
the
cake
;
and
though
Hester
,
for
whose
benefit
the
child
was
repeating
the
story
in
her
broken
language
for
the
third
or
fourth
time
,
tried
to
catch
the
watch
as
it
was
intended
<EOS>
that
she
should
(
she
being
the
representative
of
the
"
hungry
man
"
for
the
time
being
)
,
it
went
to
the
ground
with
a
smash
that
frightened
the
little
girl
,
and
she
began
to
cry
at
the
mischief
she
had
done
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
cry
,
Bella
,
"
said
Hester
.
<EOS>
"
Niver
play
with
watches
again
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
see
thee
at
mine
,
or
I
'd
ha
'
stopped
thee
in
time
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
take
it
to
old
Darley
's
on
th
'
quay
-
side
,
and
maybe
he
'll
soon
set
it
to
rights
again
.
<EOS>
Only
Bella
must
niver
play
with
watches
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Niver
no
more
!
"
<EOS>
promised
the
little
sobbing
child
.
<EOS>
And
that
evening
Hester
took
her
watch
down
to
old
Darley
's
.
  
<EOS>
This
William
Darley
was
the
brother
of
the
gardener
at
the
rectory
;
the
uncle
to
the
sailor
who
had
been
shot
by
the
press
-
gang
years
before
,
and
to
his
bed
-
ridden
sister
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
clever
mechanician
,
and
his
skill
as
a
repairer
of
watches
and
chronometers
was
great
among
the
sailors
,
with
whom
he
did
a
very
irregular
sort
of
traffic
,
conducted
,
often
without
much
use
of
money
,
but
rather
on
the
principle
of
barter
,
they
bringing
him
foreign
coins
and
odd
curiosities
picked
up
on
their
travels
in
exchange
for
his
services
to
their
nautical
instruments
or
their
watches
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
ever
had
capital
to
extend
his
business
,
he
might
have
been
a
rich
man
;
but
it
is
to
be
doubted
whether
he
would
have
been
as
happy
as
he
was
now
in
his
queer
little
habitation
of
two
rooms
,
the
front
one
being
both
shop
and
workshop
,
the
other
serving
the
double
purpose
of
bedroom
and
museum
.
  
<EOS>
The
skill
of
this
odd
-
tempered
,
shabby
old
man
was
sometimes
sought
by
the
jeweller
who
kept
the
more
ostentatious
shop
in
the
High
Street
;
but
before
Darley
would
undertake
any
"
tickle
"
piece
of
delicate
workmanship
for
the
other
,
he
sneered
at
his
ignorance
,
and
taunted
and
abused
him
well
.
<EOS>
Yet
he
had
soft
places
in
his
heart
,
and
Hester
Rose
had
found
her
way
to
one
by
her
patient
,
enduring
kindness
to
his
bed
-
ridden
niece
.
<EOS>
He
never
snarled
at
her
as
he
did
at
too
many
;
and
on
the
few
occasions
when
she
had
asked
him
to
do
anything
for
her
,
he
had
seemed
as
if
she
were
conferring
the
favour
on
him
,
not
he
on
her
,
and
only
made
the
smallest
possible
charge
.
  
<EOS>
She
found
him
now
sitting
where
he
could
catch
the
most
light
for
his
work
,
spectacles
on
nose
,
and
microscope
in
hand
.
  
<EOS>
He
took
her
watch
,
and
examined
it
carefully
without
a
word
in
reply
to
her
.
<EOS>
Then
he
began
to
open
it
and
take
it
to
pieces
,
in
order
to
ascertain
the
nature
of
the
mischief
.
  
<EOS>
Suddenly
he
heard
her
catch
her
breath
with
a
checked
sound
of
surprise
.
<EOS>
He
looked
at
her
from
above
his
spectacles
;
she
was
holding
a
watch
in
her
hand
which
she
had
just
taken
up
off
the
counter
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
amiss
wi
'
thee
now
?
"
said
Darley
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hast
ta
niver
seen
a
watch
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
that
mak
'
afore
?
<EOS>
or
is
it
them
letters
on
t
'
back
,
as
is
so
wonderful
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Yes
,
it
was
those
letters
 
that
interlaced
,
old
-
fashioned
cipher
.
<EOS>
That
Z.
H.
that
she
knew
of
old
stood
for
Zachary
Hepburn
,
Philip
's
father
.
<EOS>
She
knew
how
Philip
valued
this
watch
.
<EOS>
She
remembered
having
seen
it
in
his
hands
the
very
day
before
his
disappearance
,
when
he
was
looking
at
the
time
in
his
annoyance
at
Sylvia
's
detention
in
her
walk
with
baby
.
<EOS>
Hester
had
no
doubt
that
he
had
taken
this
watch
as
a
matter
of
course
away
with
him
.
<EOS>
She
felt
sure
that
he
would
not
part
with
this
relic
of
his
dead
father
on
any
slight
necessity
.
<EOS>
Where
,
then
,
was
Philip
?
 
<EOS>
by
what
chance
of
life
or
death
had
this
,
his
valued
property
,
found
its
way
once
more
to
Monkshaven
?
  
<EOS>
"
Where
did
yo
'
get
this
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
,
in
as
quiet
a
manner
as
she
could
assume
,
sick
with
eagerness
as
she
was
.
  
<EOS>
To
no
one
else
would
Darley
have
answered
such
a
question
.
<EOS>
He
made
a
mystery
of
most
of
his
dealings
;
not
that
he
had
anything
to
conceal
,
but
simply
because
he
delighted
in
concealment
.
<EOS>
He
took
it
out
of
her
hands
,
looked
at
the
number
marked
inside
,
and
the
maker
's
name
 
<EOS>
"
Natteau
Gent
,
York
"
 
and
then
replied
,
    
"
A
man
brought
it
me
yesterday
,
at
nightfall
,
for
t
'
sell
it
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
matter
o
'
forty
years
old
.
<EOS>
Natteau
Gent
has
been
dead
and
in
his
grave
pretty
nigh
as
long
as
that
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
his
work
well
when
he
were
alive
;
and
so
I
gave
him
as
brought
it
for
t
'
sell
about
as
much
as
it
were
worth
,
i
'
good
coin
.
<EOS>
A
tried
him
first
<EOS>
i
'
t
'
bartering
line
,
but
<EOS>
he
would
n't
bite
;
like
enough
he
wanted
food
,
 
many
a
one
does
now
-
a
-
days
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
was
he
?
"
<EOS>
gasped
Hester
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bless
t
'
woman
!
<EOS>
how
should
I
know
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
was
he
like
?
 
<EOS>
how
old
?
 
<EOS>
tell
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
lass
,
a've
summut
else
to
do
wi
'
my
eyes
than
go
peering
into
men
's
faces
i
'
t
'
dusk
light
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
yo
'
must
have
had
light
for
t
'
judge
about
the
watch
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Eh
!
<EOS>
how
sharp
we
are
!
<EOS>
A'd
a
candle
close
to
my
nose
.
<EOS>
But
a
did
n't
tak
'
it
up
for
to
gaze
int
'
<EOS>
his
face
.
<EOS>
That
would
n't
be
manners
,
to
my
thinking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hester
was
silent
.
<EOS>
Then
Darley
's
heart
relented
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
yo're
so
set
upo
'
knowing
who
t
'
fellow
was
,
a
could
,
mebbe
,
put
yo
'
on
his
tracks
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
?
"
said
Hester
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
want
to
know
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
know
very
much
,
and
for
a
good
reason
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
a'll
tell
yo
'
.
<EOS>
He
's
a
queer
tyke
,
that
one
is
.
<EOS>
A'll
be
bound
he
were
sore
pressed
for
t
'
brass
;
yet
he
<EOS>
out
's
wi
'
<EOS>
a
good
half
-
crown
,
all
wrapped
up
i
'
paper
,
and
he
axes
me
t
'
make
a
hole
in
it
.
<EOS>
Says
I
,
"
It
's
marring
good
king
's
coin
,
at
after
a've
made
a
hole
in't
,
it
'll
never
pass
current
again
.
"
<EOS>
So
he
mumbles
,
and
mumbles
,
but
for
a
'
that
it
must
needs
be
done
;
and
he
's
left
it
here
,
and
is
t
'
call
for
'
t
to
-
morrow
at
e'en
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
William
Darley
!
"
said
Hester
,
clasping
her
hands
tight
together
.
<EOS>
"
Find
out
who
he
is
,
where
he
is
 
anything
 
everything
about
him
 
<EOS>
and
I
will
so
bless
yo
'
.
<EOS>
"
  
Darley
looked
at
her
sharply
,
but
with
some
signs
of
sympathy
on
his
grave
face
.
<EOS>
"
My
woman
,
"
he
said
"
a
could
ha
'
wished
as
you
'd
niver
seen
t
'
watch
.
<EOS>
It
's
poor
,
thankless
work
thinking
too
much
on
one
o
'
God
's
creatures
.
<EOS>
But
a'll
do
thy
bidding
,
"
he
continued
,
in
a
lighter
and
different
tone
.
"
<EOS>
A'm
a
'
cute
old
badger
when
need
be
.
<EOS>
Come
for
thy
watch
in
a
couple
o
'
days
,
and
a'll
tell
yo
'
all
as
a've
learnt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
Hester
went
away
,
her
heart
beating
with
the
promise
of
knowing
something
about
Philip
,
 
how
much
,
how
little
,
in
these
first
moments
,
she
dared
not
say
even
to
herself
.
<EOS>
Some
sailor
newly
landed
from
distant
seas
might
have
become
possessed
of
Philip
's
watch
in
far
-
off
latitudes
;
in
which
case
,
Philip
would
be
dead
.
<EOS>
That
might
be
.
<EOS>
She
tried
to
think
that
this
was
the
most
probable
way
of
accounting
for
the
watch
.
<EOS>
She
could
be
certain
as
to
the
positive
identity
of
the
watch
 
being
in
William
Darley
's
possession
.
<EOS>
Again
,
it
might
be
that
Philip
himself
was
near
at
hand
 
<EOS>
was
here
in
this
very
place
 
<EOS>
starving
,
as
too
many
were
,
for
insufficiency
of
means
to
buy
the
high
-
priced
food
.
<EOS>
And
then
her
heart
burnt
within
her
as
she
thought
of
the
succulent
,
comfortable
meals
which
Sylvia
provided
every
day
 
nay
,
three
times
a
day
 
for
the
household
in
the
market
-
place
,
at
the
head
of
which
Philip
ought
to
have
been
;
but
his
place
knew
him
not
.
<EOS>
For
Sylvia
had
inherited
her
mother
's
talent
for
housekeeping
,
and
on
her
,
in
Alice
's
decrepitude
and
Hester
's
other
occupations
in
the
shop
,
devolved
the
cares
of
due
provision
for
the
somewhat
heterogeneous
family
.
  
<EOS>
And
Sylvia
!
<EOS>
Hester
groaned
in
heart
over
the
remembrance
of
Sylvia
's
words
,
"
I
can
niver
forgive
him
the
wrong
he
did
to
me
,
"
that
night
when
Hester
had
come
,
and
clung
to
her
,
making
the
sad
,
shameful
confession
of
her
unreturned
love
.
  
<EOS>
What
could
ever
bring
these
two
together
again
?
<EOS>
Could
Hester
herself
 
ignorant
of
the
strange
mystery
of
Sylvia
's
heart
,
as
those
who
are
guided
solely
by
obedience
to
principle
must
ever
be
of
the
clue
to
the
actions
of
those
who
are
led
by
the
passionate
ebb
and
flow
of
impulse
?
<EOS>
Could
Hester
herself
?
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
how
should
she
speak
,
how
should
she
act
,
if
Philip
were
near
 
if
Philip
were
sad
and
in
miserable
estate
?
<EOS>
Her
own
misery
at
this
contemplation
of
the
case
was
too
great
to
bear
;
and
she
sought
her
usual
refuge
in
the
thought
of
some
text
,
some
promise
of
Scripture
,
which
should
strengthen
her
faith
.
  
<EOS>
"
With
God
all
things
are
possible
,
"
said
she
,
repeating
the
words
as
though
to
lull
her
anxiety
to
rest
.
  
<EOS>
Yes
;
with
God
all
things
are
possible
.
<EOS>
But
ofttimes
He
does
his
work
with
awful
instruments
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
peacemaker
whose
name
is
Death
.
    
<EOS>
SAVED
AND
LOST
  
<EOS>
Hester
went
out
on
the
evening
of
the
day
after
that
on
which
the
unknown
owner
of
the
half
-
crown
had
appointed
to
call
for
it
again
at
William
Darley
's
.
<EOS>
She
had
schooled
herself
to
believe
that
time
and
patience
would
serve
her
best
.
<EOS>
Her
plan
was
to
obtain
all
the
knowledge
about
Philip
that
she
could
in
the
first
instance
;
and
then
,
if
circumstances
allowed
it
,
as
in
all
probability
they
would
,
to
let
drop
by
drop
of
healing
,
peacemaking
words
and
thoughts
fall
on
Sylvia
's
obdurate
,
unforgiving
heart
.
<EOS>
So
Hester
put
on
her
things
,
and
went
out
down
towards
the
old
quay
-
side
on
that
evening
after
the
shop
was
closed
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
little
Sylvia
!
<EOS>
She
was
unforgiving
,
but
not
obdurate
to
the
full
extent
of
what
Hester
believed
.
<EOS>
Many
a
time
since
Philip
went
away
had
she
unconsciously
missed
his
protecting
love
;
when
folks
spoke
shortly
to
her
,
when
Alice
scolded
her
as
one
of
the
non
-
elect
,
when
Hester
's
gentle
gravity
had
something
of
severity
in
it
;
when
her
own
heart
failed
her
as
to
whether
her
mother
would
have
judged
that
she
had
done
well
,
could
that
mother
have
known
all
,
as
possibly
she
did
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
Philip
had
never
spoken
otherwise
than
tenderly
to
her
during
the
eighteen
months
of
their
married
life
,
except
on
the
two
occasions
before
recorded
:
once
when
she
referred
to
her
dream
of
Kinraid
's
possible
return
,
and
once
again
on
the
evening
of
the
day
before
her
discovery
of
his
concealment
of
the
secret
of
Kinraid
's
involuntary
disappearance
.
  
<EOS>
After
she
had
learnt
that
Kinraid
was
married
,
her
heart
had
still
more
strongly
turned
to
Philip
;
she
thought
that
he
had
judged
rightly
in
what
he
had
given
as
the
excuse
for
his
double
dealing
;
she
was
even
more
indignant
at
Kinraid
's
fickleness
than
she
had
any
reason
to
be
;
and
she
began
to
learn
the
value
of
such
enduring
love
as
Philip
's
had
been
 
lasting
ever
since
the
days
when
she
first
began
to
fancy
what
a
man
's
love
for
a
woman
should
be
,
when
she
had
first
shrunk
from
the
tone
of
tenderness
he
put
into
his
especial
term
for
her
,
a
girl
of
twelve
 
"
Little
lassie
,
"
as
he
was
wo
nt
to
call
her
.
  
<EOS>
But
across
all
this
relenting
came
the
shadow
of
her
<EOS>
vow
 
like
the
chill
of
a
great
cloud
passing
over
a
sunny
plain
.
<EOS>
How
should
she
decide
?
<EOS>
what
would
be
her
duty
,
if
he
came
again
,
and
once
more
called
her
"
wife
"
?
<EOS>
She
shrank
from
such
a
possibility
with
all
the
weakness
and
superstition
of
her
nature
;
and
this
<EOS>
it
was
which
made
her
strengthen
herself
with
the
re
-
utterance
of
unforgiving
words
;
and
shun
all
recurrence
to
the
subject
on
the
rare
occasion
when
Hester
had
tried
to
bring
it
back
,
with
a
hope
of
softening
the
heart
which
to
her
appeared
altogether
hardened
on
this
one
point
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
on
this
bright
summer
evening
,
while
Hester
had
gone
down
to
the
quay
-
side
,
Sylvia
stood
with
her
out
-
of
-
door
things
on
in
the
parlour
,
rather
impatiently
watching
the
sky
,
full
of
hurrying
clouds
,
and
flushing
with
the
warm
tints
of
the
approaching
sunset
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
leave
Alice
:
the
old
woman
had
grown
so
infirm
that
she
was
never
left
by
her
daughter
and
Sylvia
at
the
same
time
;
yet
Sylvia
had
to
fetch
her
little
girl
from
the
New
Town
,
where
she
had
been
to
her
supper
at
Jeremiah
Foster
's
.
<EOS>
Hester
had
said
that
she
should
not
be
away
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
;
and
Hester
was
generally
so
punctual
that
any
failure
of
hers
,
in
this
respect
,
appeared
almost
in
the
light
of
an
injury
on
those
who
had
learnt
to
rely
upon
her
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
wanted
to
go
and
see
widow
Dobson
,
and
learn
when
Kester
might
be
expected
home
.
<EOS>
His
two
months
were
long
past
;
and
Sylvia
had
heard
through
the
Fosters
of
some
suitable
and
profitable
employment
for
him
,
of
which
she
thought
he
would
be
glad
to
know
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
some
time
since
she
had
been
able
to
get
so
far
as
across
the
bridge
;
and
,
for
aught
she
knew
,
Kester
might
already
be
come
back
from
his
expedition
to
the
Cheviots
.
<EOS>
Kester
was
come
back
.
<EOS>
Scarce
five
minutes
had
elapsed
after
these
thoughts
had
passed
through
her
mind
before
his
hasty
hand
lifted
the
latch
of
the
kitchen
-
door
,
his
hurried
steps
brought
him
face
to
face
with
her
.
<EOS>
The
smile
of
greeting
was
arrested
on
her
lips
by
one
look
at
him
:
his
eyes
staring
wide
,
the
expression
on
his
face
wild
,
and
yet
pitiful
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
reet
,
"
said
he
,
seeing
that
her
things
were
already
on
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Thou're
wanted
sore
.
<EOS>
Come
along
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
dear
God
!
<EOS>
my
child
!
"
cried
Sylvia
,
clutching
at
the
chair
near
her
;
but
recovering
her
eddying
senses
with
the
strong
fact
before
her
that
whatever
the
terror
was
,
she
was
needed
to
combat
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
;
thy
child
!
<EOS>
"
said
Kester
,
taking
her
almost
roughly
by
the
arm
,
and
drawing
her
away
with
him
out
through
the
open
doors
on
to
the
quay
-
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
!
"
<EOS>
said
Sylvia
,
faintly
,
"
is
she
dead
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
safe
now
,
"
said
Kester
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
her
 
<EOS>
it
's
him
as
saved
her
as
needs
yo
'
,
if
iver
husband
needed
a
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
?
 
<EOS>
who
?
<EOS>
O
Philip
!
<EOS>
Philip
!
<EOS>
is
it
yo
'
at
last
?
"
  
<EOS>
Unheeding
what
spectators
might
see
her
movements
,
she
threw
up
her
arms
and
staggered
against
the
parapet
of
the
bridge
they
were
then
crossing
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
!
 
<EOS>
Philip
!
 
<EOS>
saved
Bella
?
<EOS>
Bella
,
our
little
Bella
,
as
got
her
dinner
by
my
side
,
and
went
out
wi
'
Jeremiah
,
as
well
as
could
be
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
take
it
in
;
tell
me
,
Kester
.
"
<EOS>
She
kept
trembling
so
much
in
voice
and
in
body
,
that
he
saw
she
could
not
stir
without
danger
of
falling
until
she
was
calmed
;
as
it
was
,
her
eyes
became
filmy
from
time
to
time
,
and
she
drew
her
breath
in
great
heavy
pants
,
leaning
all
the
while
against
the
wall
of
the
bridge
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
were
no
illness
,
"
Kester
began
.
<EOS>
"

said
Sylvia
,
struggling
with
his
detaining
hand
,
which
he
had
laid
upon
her
in
the
fear
that
she
would
slip
down
to
the
ground
in
a
faint
,
so
ashen

gray
was
her
face
.
<EOS>
"
Let

"
  
<EOS>
He
let
go
,
and
she
stood
still
,
suddenly
feeling
herself
too
weak
to
stir
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now

"
An

reproachfully

<EOS>
"
I

she
whispered
,
"
and
yo

said
he
wanted

<EOS>
so
I
know
he
's
safe
;
and
,
<EOS>
Kester
,
I
think
I
'm
'
feared
on
him
,
and
I
'd
like
to
gather
courage
afore
seeing
him
,
and
a
look
at
Bella
would
give
me
courage
.
<EOS>
It
were
a
terrible
time
when
I
saw
him
last
,
and
I
did
say
 
'

<EOS>
He
were
dashed
again

an

bruised

his
innards
afore

men
as

a

him
up

"
  
<EOS>
She
did
not
speak
;
she
did
not
even
tremble
now
;
she
set
her
teeth
together
,
and
,
holding
tight
by
Kester
,
she
urged
him
on
;
but
when
they
came
to
the
end
of
the
bridge
,
she
seemed
uncertain
which
way
to
turn
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
way

"
said
Kester
.
<EOS>
"
He

<EOS>
Oh

"
  
<EOS>
Muttering
to
herself
,
breaking
her
mutterings
with
sharp
cries
of
pain
,
Sylvia
,
with
Kester
's
help
,
reached
widow
Dobson
's
house
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
longer
a
quiet
,
lonely
dwelling
.
<EOS>
Several
sailors
stood
about
the
door
,
awaiting
,
in
silent
anxiety
,
for
the
verdict
of
the
doctor
,
who
was
even
now
examining
Philip
's
injuries
.
<EOS>
Two
or
three
women
stood
talking
eagerly
,
in
low
voices
,
in
the
doorway
.
  
<EOS>
But
when
Sylvia
drew
near
the
men
fell
back
;
and
the
women
moved
aside
as
though
to
allow
her
to
pass
,
all
looking
upon
her
with
a
certain
amount
of
sympathy
,
but
perhaps
with
rather
more
of
antagonistic
wonder
as
to
how
she
was
taking
it
 
<EOS>
she
who
had
been
living
in
ease
and
comfort
while
her
husband
's
shelter
was
little
better
than
a
hovel
,
her
husband
's
daily
life
a
struggle
with
starvation
;
for
so
much
of
the
lodger
at
widow
Dobson
's
was
popularly
known
;
and
any
distrust
of
him
as
a
stranger
and
a
tramp
was
quite
forgotten
now
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
felt
the
hardness
of
their
looks
,
the
hardness
of
their
silence
;
but
it
was
as
nothing
to
her
.
<EOS>
If
such
things
could
have
touched
her
at
this
moment
,
she
would
not
have
stood
still
right
in
the
midst
of
their
averted
hearts
,
and
murmured
something
to
Kester
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
hear
the
words
uttered
by
that
hoarse
choked
voice
,
until
he
had
stooped
down
and
brought
his
ear
to
the
level
of
her
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
'd
better
wait
for
t
'
doctors
to
come
out
,
"
she
said
again
.
<EOS>
She
stood
by
the
door
,
shivering
all
over
,
almost
facing
the
people
in
the
road
,
but
with
her
face
turned
a
little
to
the
right
,
so
that
they
thought
she
was
looking
at
the
pathway
on
the
cliff
-
side
,
a
hundred
yards
<EOS>
or
so
distant
,
below
which
the
hungry
waves
still
lashed
themselves
into
high
ascending
spray
<EOS>
;
while
nearer
to
the
cottage
,
where
their
force
was
broken
by
the
bar
at
the
entrance
to
the
river
,
they
came
softly
lapping
up
the
shelving
shore
.
  
<EOS>
Sylvia
saw
nothing
of
all
this
,
though
it
was
straight
before
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
She
only
saw
a
blurred
mist
;
she
heard
no
sound
of
waters
,
though
it
filled
the
ears
of
those
around
.
<EOS>
Instead
she
heard
low
whispers
pronouncing
Philip
's
earthly
doom
.
  
<EOS>
For
the
doctors
were
both
agreed
;
his
internal
injury
was
of
a
mortal
kind
,
although
,
as
the
spine
was
severely
injured
above
the
seat
of
the
fatal
bruise
,
he
had
no
pain
in
the
lower
half
of
his
body
.
  
<EOS>
They
had
spoken
in
so
low
a
tone
that
John
Foster
,
standing
only
a
foot
or
so
away
,
had
not
been
able
to
hear
their
words
.
<EOS>
But
Sylvia
heard
each
syllable
there
where
she
stood
outside
,
shivering
all
over
in
the
sultry
summer
evening
.
<EOS>
She
turned
round
to
Kester
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mun
go
to
him
,
Kester
<EOS>
;
thou'll
see
that
noane
come
in
to
us
,
when
t
'
doctors
come
out
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
spoke
in
a
soft
,
calm
voice
;
and
he
,
not
knowing
what
she
had
heard
,
made
some
easy
conditional
promise
.
<EOS>
Then
those
opposite
to
the
cottage
door
fell
back
,
for
they
could
see
the
grave
doctors
coming
out
,
and
John
Foster
,
graver
,
sadder
still
,
following
them
.
<EOS>
Without
a
word
to
them
,
 
without
a
word
even
of
inquiry
 
which
many
outside
thought
and
spoke
of
as
strange
 
white
-
faced
,
dry
-
eyed
Sylvia
slipped
into
the
house
out
of
their
sight
.
  
<EOS>
And
the
waves
kept
lapping
on
the
shelving
shore
.
  
<EOS>
The
room
inside
was
dark
,
all
except
the
little
halo
or
circle
of
light
made
by
a
dip
candle
.
<EOS>
Widow
Dobson
had
her
back
to
the
bed
 
her
bed
 
on
to
which
Philip
had
been
borne
in
the
hurry
of
terror
as
to
whether
he
was
alive
or
whether
he
was
dead
.
<EOS>
She
was
crying
 
crying
quietly
,
but
the
tears
down
-
falling
fast
,
as
,
with
her
back
to
the
lowly
bed
,
she
was
gathering
up
the
dripping
clothes
cut
off
from
the
poor
maimed
body
by
the
doctors
'
orders
.
<EOS>
She
only
shook
her
head
as
she
saw
Sylvia
,
spirit
-
like
,
steal
in
 
white
,
noiseless
,
and
upborne
from
earth
.
  
<EOS>
But
noiseless
as
her
step
might
be
,
he
heard
,
he
recognized
,
and
with
a
sigh
he
turned
his
poor
disfigured
face
to
the
wall
,
hiding
it
in
the
shadow
.
  
<EOS>
He
knew
that
she
was
by
him
;
that
she
had
knelt
down
by
his
bed
;
that
she
was
kissing
his
hand
,
over
which
the
languor
of
approaching
death
was
stealing
.
<EOS>
But
no
one
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
he
said
,
his
face
still
averted
,
speaking
with
an
effort
.
  
<EOS>
"
Little
lassie
,
forgive
me
now
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
live
to
see
the
morn
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
answer
,
only
a
long
miserable
sigh
,
and
he
felt
her
soft
cheek
laid
upon
his
hand
,
and
the
quiver
that
ran
through
her
whole
body
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
thee
a
cruel
wrong
,
"
he
said
,
at
length
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
it
now
.
<EOS>
But
I
'm
a
dying
man
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
God
will
forgive
me
 
<EOS>
and
I
've
sinned
against
Him
;
try
,
<EOS>
lassie
 
try
,
my
Sylvie
 
will
not
thou
forgive
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
listened
intently
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
He
heard
through
the
open
window
the
waves
lapping
on
the
shelving
shore
.
<EOS>
But
there
came
no
word
from
her
;
only
that
same
long
shivering
,
miserable
sigh
broke
from
her
lips
at
length
.
  
<EOS>
"
Child
,
"
said
he
,
once
more
.
<EOS>
"
I
ha
'
made
thee
my
idol
;
and
if
I
could
live
my
life
o'er
again
I
would
love
my
God
more
,
and
thee
less
;
and
then
I
should
n't
ha
'
sinned
this
sin
against
thee
.
<EOS>
But
speak
one
word
of
love
to
me
 
one
little
word
,
that
I
may
know
I
have
thy
pardon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Philip
!
<EOS>
Philip
!
<EOS>
"
she
moaned
,
thus
adjured
.
  
<EOS>
Then
she
lifted
her
head
,
and
said
,
  
"
Them
were
wicked
,
wicked
words
,
as
I
said
;
and
a
wicked
vow
as
I
vowed
;
and
Lord
God
Almighty
has
ta'en
me
at
my
word
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sorely
punished
,
Philip
,
I
am
indeed
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
pressed
her
hand
,
he
stroked
her
cheek
.
<EOS>
But
he
asked
for
yet
another
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
thee
a
wrong
.
<EOS>
In
my
lying
heart
I
forgot
to
do
to
thee
as
I
would
have
had
thee
to
do
to
me
.
<EOS>
And
I
judged
Kinraid
in
my
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thou
thought
as
he
was
faithless
and
fickle
,
"
she
answered
quickly
;
"
and
so
he
were
.
<EOS>
He
were
married
to
another
woman
not
so
many
weeks
at
after
thou
went
away
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Philip
,
Philip
!
<EOS>
and
now
I
have
thee
back
,
and
 
'
  
"
Dying
"
was
the
word
she
would
have
said
,
but
first
the
dread
of
telling
him
what
she
believed
he
did
not
know
,
and
next
her
passionate
sobs
,
choked
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
"
said
he
,
once
more
stroking
her
cheek
,
and
soothing
her
with
gentle
,
caressing
hand
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Little
lassie
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
after
a
while
when
she
was
quiet
from
very
exhaustion
,
<EOS>
"
I
niver
thought
to
be
so
happy
again
.
<EOS>
God
is
very
merciful
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
lifted
up
her
head
,
and
asked
wildly
,
"
Will
He
iver
forgive
me
,
think
yo
'
?
<EOS>
I
drove
yo
'
<EOS>
out
fra
'
yo'r
home
,
and
sent
yo
'
away
to
t
'
wars
,
wheere
yo
'
might
ha
'
getten
yo'r
death
;
and
<EOS>
when
yo
'
come
back
,
poor
and
lone
,
and
weary
,
I
told
her
for
t
'
turn
yo
'
out
,
for
a
'
I
knew
yo
'
must
be
starving
in
these
famine
times
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
shall
go
about
among
them
as
gnash
their
teeth
for
iver
,
while
yo
'
are
wheere
all
tears
are
wiped
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
said
Philip
,
turning
round
his
face
,
forgetful
of
himself
in
his
desire
to
comfort
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
God
pities
us
as
a
father
pities
his
poor
wandering
children
;
the
nearer
I
come
to
death
the
clearer
I
see
Him
.
<EOS>
But
you
and
me
have
done
wrong
to
each
other
;
yet
we
can
see
now
how
we
were
led
to
it
;
we
can
pity
and
forgive
one
another
.
<EOS>
I
'm
getting
low
and
faint
,
lassie
;
but
thou
must
remember
this
:
God
knows
more
,
and
is
more
forgiving
than
either
you
to
me
,
or
me
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
think
and
do
believe
as
we
shall
meet
together
before
His
face
;
but
then
I
shall
ha
'
learnt
to
love
thee
second
to
Him
;
not
first
,
as
I
have
done
here
upon
the
earth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
he
was
silent
 
very
still
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
knew
 
widow
Dobson
had
brought
it
in
 
that
there
was
some
kind
of
medicine
,
sent
by
the
hopeless
doctors
,
lying
upon
the
table
hard
by
,
and
she
softly
rose
and
poured
it
out
and
dropped
it
into
the
half
-
open
mouth
.
<EOS>
Then
she
knelt
down
again
,
holding
the
hand
feebly
stretched
out
to
her
,
and
watching
the
faint
light
in
the
wistful
loving
eyes
.
<EOS>
And
in
the
stillness
she
heard
the
ceaseless
waves
lapping
against
the
shelving
shore
.
  
<EOS>
Something
like
an
hour
before
this
time
,
which
was
the
deepest
midnight
of
the
summer
's
night
,
Hester
Rose
had
come
hurrying
up
the
road
to
where
Kester
and
his
sister
sate
outside
the
open
door
,
keeping
their
watch
under
the
star
-
lit
sky
,
all
others
having
gone
away
,
one
by
one
,
even
John
and
Jeremiah
Foster
having
returned
to
their
own
house
,
where
the
little
Bella
lay
,
sleeping
a
sound
and
healthy
slumber
after
her
perilous
adventure
.
  
<EOS>
Hester
had
heard
but
little
from
William
Darley
as
to
the
owner
of
the
watch
and
the
half
-
crown
;
but
he
was
chagrined
at
the
failure
of
all
his
skilful
interrogations
to
elicit
the
truth
,
and
promised
her
further
information
in
a
few
days
,
with
all
the
more
vehemence
because
he
was
unaccustomed
to
be
baffled
.
<EOS>
And
Hester
had
again
whispered
to
herself
"
Patience
!
<EOS>
Patience
!
"
and
had
slowly
returned
back
to
her
home
to
find
that
Sylvia
had
left
it
,
why
she
did
not
at
once
discover
.
<EOS>
But
,
growing
uneasy
as
the
advancing
hours
neither
brought
Sylvia
nor
little
Bella
to
their
home
,
she
had
set
out
for
Jeremiah
Foster
's
as
soon
as
she
had
seen
her
mother
comfortably
asleep
in
her
bed
;
and
then
she
had
learnt
the
whole
story
,
bit
by
bit
,
as
each
person
who
spoke
broke
in
upon
the
previous
narration
with
some
new
particular
.
<EOS>
But
from
no
one
did
she
clearly
learn
whether
Sylvia
was
with
her
husband
,
or
not
;
and
so
she
came
speeding
along
the
road
,
breathless
,
to
where
Kester
sate
in
<EOS>
wakeful
,
mournful
silence
,
his
sister
's
sleeping
head
lying
on
his
shoulder
,
the
cottage
door
open
,
both
for
air
and
that
there
might
be
help
within
call
if
needed
;
and
the
dim
slanting
oblong
of
the
interior
light
lying
across
the
road
.
  
<EOS>
Hester
came
panting
up
,
too
agitated
and
breathless
to
ask
how
much
was
truth
of
the
fatal
,
hopeless
tale
which
she
had
heard
.
<EOS>
Kester
looked
at
her
without
a
word
.
<EOS>
Through
this
solemn
momentary
silence
the
lapping
of
the
ceaseless
waves
was
heard
,
as
they
came
up
close
on
the
shelving
shore
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
?
<EOS>
Philip
?
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
Kester
shook
his
head
sadly
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
his
wife
 
Sylvia
?
"
said
Hester
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
there
with
him
,
alone
,
"
whispered
Kester
.
  
<EOS>
Hester
turned
away
,
and
wrung
her
hands
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Lord
God
Almighty
!
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
"
was
I
not
even
worthy
to
bring
them
together
at
last
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
she
went
away
slowly
and
heavily
back
to
the
side
of
her
sleeping
mother
.
<EOS>
But
"
Thy
will
be
done
"
was
on
her
quivering
lips
before
she
lay
down
to
her
rest
.
  
<EOS>
The
soft
gray
dawn
lightens
the
darkness
of
a
midsummer
night
soon
after
two
o'clock
.
<EOS>
Philip
watched
it
come
,
knowing
that
it
was
his
last
sight
of
day
,
 
as
we
reckon
days
on
earth
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
been
often
near
death
as
a
soldier
;
once
or
twice
,
as
when
he
rushed
into
fire
to
save
Kinraid
,
his
chances
of
life
had
been
as
one
to
a
hundred
;
but
yet
he
had
had
a
chance
.
<EOS>
But
now
there
was
the
new
feeling
 
the
last
new
feeling
which
we
shall
any
of
us
experience
in
this
world
 
that
death
was
not
only
close
at
hand
,
but
inevitable
.
  
<EOS>
He
felt
its
numbness
stealing
up
him
 
stealing
up
him
.
<EOS>
But
the
head
was
clear
,
the
brain
more
than
commonly
active
in
producing
vivid
impressions
.
  
<EOS>
It
seemed
but
yesterday
since
he
was
a
little
boy
at
his
mother
's
knee
,
wishing
with
all
the
earnestness
of
his
childish
heart
to
be
like
Abraham
,
who
was
called
the
friend
of
God
,
or
David
,
who
was
said
to
be
the
man
after
God
's
own
heart
,
or
St
John
,
who
was
called
"
the
Beloved
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
very
present
seemed
the
day
on
which
he
made
resolutions
of
trying
to
be
like
them
;
it
was
in
the
spring
,
and
some
one
had
brought
in
cowslips
;
and
the
scent
of
those
flowers
was
in
his
nostrils
now
,
as
he
lay
a
-
dying
 
<EOS>
his
life
ended
,
his
battles
fought
,
his
time
for
"
being
good
"
over
and
gone
 
the
opportunity
,
once
given
in
all
eternity
,
past
.
  
<EOS>
All
the
temptations
that
had
beset
him
rose
clearly
before
him
;
the
scenes
themselves
stood
up
in
their
solid
materialism
 
he
could
have
touched
the
places
;
the
people
,
the
thoughts
,
the
arguments
that
Satan
had
urged
in
behalf
of
sin
,
were
reproduced
with
the
vividness
of
a
present
time
.
<EOS>
And
he
knew
that
the
thoughts
were
illusions
,
the
arguments
false
and
hollow
;
for
in
that
hour
came
the
perfect
vision
of
the
perfect
truth
:
he
saw
the
"
way
to
escape
"
which
had
come
along
with
the
temptation
;
now
,
the
strong
resolve
of
an
ardent
boyhood
,
with
all
a
life
before
it
to
show
the
world
"
what
a
Christian
might
be
"
;
and
then
the
swift
,
terrible
now
,
when
his
naked
,
guilty
soul
shrank
into
the
shadow
of
God
's
mercy
-
seat
,
out
of
the
blaze
of
His
anger
against
all
those
who
act
a
lie
.
  
<EOS>
His
mind
was
wandering
,
and
he
plucked
it
back
.
<EOS>
Was
this
death
in
very
deed
?
<EOS>
He
tried
to
grasp
at
the
present
,
the
earthly
present
,
fading
quick
away
.
<EOS>
He
lay
there
on
the
bed
 
on
Sally
Dobson
's
bed
in
the
house
-
place
,
not
on
his
accustomed
pallet
in
the
lean
-
to
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
much
.
<EOS>
And
the
door
was
open
into
the
still
,
dusk
night
;
and
through
the
open
casement
he
could
hear
the
lapping
of
the
waves
on
the
shelving
shore
,
could
see
the
soft
gray
dawn
over
the
sea
 
<EOS>
he
knew
it
was
over
the
sea
 
<EOS>
he
saw
what
lay
unseen
behind
the
poor
walls
of
the
cottage
.
<EOS>
And
it
was
Sylvia
who
held
his
hand
tight
in
her
warm
,
living
grasp
;
it
was
his
wife
whose
arm
was
thrown
around
him
,
whose
sobbing
sighs
shook
his
numbed
frame
from
time
to
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
and
comfort
my
darling
,
"
he
said
to
himself
.
"
<EOS>
She
knows
me
now
.
<EOS>
All
will
be
right
in
heaven
 
in
the
light
of
God
's
mercy
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
then
he
tried
to
remember
all
that
he
had
ever
read
about
,
God
,
and
all
that
the
blessed
Christ
 
that
bringeth
glad
tidings
of
great
joy
unto
all
people
,
had
said
of
the
Father
,
from
whom
He
came
.
<EOS>
Those
sayings
dropped
like
balm
down
upon
his
troubled
heart
and
brain
.
<EOS>
He
remembered
his
mother
,
and
how
she
had
loved
him
;
and
he
was
going
to
a
love
wiser
,
tenderer
,
deeper
than
hers
.
  
<EOS>
As
he
thought
this
,
he
moved
his
hands
as
if
to
pray
;
but
Sylvia
clenched
her
hold
,
and
he
lay
still
,
praying
all
the
same
for
her
,
for
his
child
,
and
for
himself
.
<EOS>
Then
he
saw
the
sky
redden
with
the
first
flush
of
dawn
;
he
heard
Kester
's
long
-
drawn
sigh
of
weariness
outside
the
open
door
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
seen
widow
Dobson
pass
through
long
before
to
keep
the
remainder
of
her
watch
on
the
bed
in
the
lean
-
to
,
which
had
been
his
for
many
and
many
a
sleepless
and
tearful
night
.
<EOS>
Those
nights
were
over
 
he
should
never
see
that
poor
chamber
again
,
though
it
was
scarce
two
feet
distant
.
<EOS>
He
began
to
lose
all
sense
of
the
comparative
duration
of
time
:
it
seemed
as
long
since
kind
Sally
Dobson
had
bent
over
him
with
soft
,
lingering
look
,
before
going
into
the
humble
sleeping
-
room
 
as
long
as
it
was
since
his
boyhood
,
when
he
stood
by
his
mother
dreaming
of
the
life
that
should
be
his
,
with
the
scent
of
the
cowslips
tempting
him
to
be
off
to
the
woodlands
where
they
grew
.
<EOS>
Then
there
came
a
rush
and
an
eddying
through
his
brain
 
his
soul
trying
her
wings
for
the
long
flight
.
<EOS>
Again
he
was
in
the
present
<EOS>
:
he
heard
the
waves
lapping
against
the
shelving
shore
once
again
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
his
thoughts
came
back
to
Sylvia
.
<EOS>
Once
more
he
spoke
aloud
,
in
a
strange
and
terrible
voice
,
which
was
not
his
.
<EOS>
Every
sound
came
with
efforts
that
were
new
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
wife
!
<EOS>
Sylvie
!
<EOS>
Once
more
 
forgive
me
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
sprang
up
,
she
kissed
his
poor
burnt
lips
;
she
held
him
in
her
arms
,
she
moaned
,
and
said
,
  
"
Oh
,
wicked
me
!
<EOS>
forgive
me
 
me
 
Philip
!
"
  
<EOS>
Then
he
spoke
,
and
said
,
"
Lord
,
forgive
us
our
trespasses
as
we
forgive
each
other
!
"
<EOS>
And
after
that
the
power
of
speech
was
conquered
by
the
coming
death
.
<EOS>
He
lay
very
still
,
his
consciousness
fast
fading
away
,
yet
coming
back
in
throbs
,
so
that
he
knew
it
was
Sylvia
who
touched
his
lips
with
cordial
,
and
that
it
was
Sylvia
who
murmured
words
of
love
in
his
ear
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
sleep
at
last
,
and
so
he
did
 
a
kind
of
sleep
,
but
the
light
of
the
red
morning
sun
fell
on
his
eyes
,
and
with
one
strong
effort
he
rose
up
,
and
turned
so
as
once
more
to
see
his
wife
's
pale
face
of
misery
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
heaven
,
"
he
cried
,
and
a
bright
smile
came
on
his
face
,
as
he
fell
back
on
his
pillow
.
  
<EOS>
Not
long
after
Hester
came
,
the
little
Bella
scarce
awake
in
her
arms
,
with
the
purpose
of
bringing
his
child
to
see
him
ere
<EOS>
yet
he
passed
away
.
<EOS>
Hester
had
watched
and
prayed
through
the
livelong
night
.
<EOS>
And
now
she
found
him
dead
,
and
Sylvia
,
tearless
and
almost
unconscious
,
lying
by
him
,
her
hand
holding
his
,
her
other
thrown
around
him
.
  
<EOS>
Kester
,
poor
old
man
,
was
sobbing
bitterly
;
but
she
not
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
Then
Hester
bore
her
child
to
her
,
and
Sylvia
opened
wide
her
miserable
eyes
,
and
only
stared
,
as
if
all
sense
was
gone
from
her
.
<EOS>
But
Bella
suddenly
rousing
up
at
the
sight
of
the
poor
,
scarred
,
peaceful
face
,
cried
out
,
    
"
Poor
man
who
was
so
hungry
.
<EOS>
Is
he
not
hungry
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Hester
,
softly
.
<EOS>
"
The
former
things
are
passed
away
 
and
he
is
gone
where
there
is
no
more
sorrow
,
and
no
more
pain
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
then
she
broke
down
into
weeping
and
crying
.
<EOS>
Sylvia
sat
up
and
looked
at
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
yo
'
cry
,
Hester
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Yo
'
niver
said
that
yo
'
would
n't
forgive
him
as
long
as
yo
'
lived
.
<EOS>
Yo
'
niver
broke
the
heart
of
him
that
loved
yo
'
,
and
let
him
almost
starve
at
yo'r
very
door
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Philip
!
<EOS>
my
Philip
,
tender
and
true
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
Hester
came
round
and
closed
the
sad
half
-
open
eyes
;
kissing
the
calm
brow
with
a
long
farewell
kiss
.
<EOS>
As
she
did
so
,
her
eye
fell
on
a
black
ribbon
round
his
neck
.
<EOS>
She
partly
lifted
it
out
;
to
it
was
hung
a
half
-
crown
piece
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
piece
he
left
at
William
Darley
's
to
be
bored
,
"
said
she
,
"
not
many
days
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
had
crept
to
her
mother
's
arms
as
a
known
haven
in
this
strange
place
;
and
the
touch
of
his
child
loosened
the
fountains
of
her
tears
.
<EOS>
She
stretched
out
her
hand
for
the
black
ribbon
,
put
it
round
her
own
neck
;
after
a
while
she
said
,
  
"
If
I
live
very
long
,
and
try
hard
to
be
very
good
all
that
time
,
do
yo
'
think
,
Hester
,
as
God
will
let
me
to
him
where
he
is
?

Monkshaven
is
altered
now
into
a
rising
bathing
place
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
standing
near
the
site
of
widow
Dobson
's
house
on
a
summer
's
night
,
at
the
ebb
of
a
spring
-
tide
,
you
may
hear
the
waves
come
lapping
up
the
shelving
shore
with
the
same
ceaseless
,
ever
-
recurrent
sound
as
that
which
Philip
listened
to
in
the
pauses
between
life
and
death
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
it
will
be
until
"
there
shall
be
no
more
sea
"
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
memory
of
man
fades
away
.
<EOS>
A
few
old
people
can
still
tell
you
the
tradition
of
the
man
who
died
in
a
cottage
somewhere
about
this
spot
,
 
died
of
starvation
while
his
wife
lived
in
hard
-
hearted
plenty
not
two
good
stone
-
throws
away
.
<EOS>
This
is
the
form
into
which
popular
feeling
,
and
ignorance
of
the
real
facts
,
have
moulded
the
story
.
<EOS>
Not
long
since
a
lady
went
to
the
"
Public
Baths
"
,
a
handsome
stone
building
erected
on
the
very
site
of
widow
Dobson
's
cottage
,
and
finding
all
the
rooms
engaged
she
sat
down
and
had
some
talk
with
the
bathing
woman
;
and
,
as
it
chanced
,
the
conversation
fell
on
Philip
Hepburn
and
the
legend
of
his
fate
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
knew
an
old
man
when
I
was
a
girl
,
"
said
the
bathing
woman
,
"
as
could
niver
abide
to
hear
t
'
wife
blamed
.
<EOS>
He
would
say
nothing
again
'
th
'
husband
;
he
used
to
say
as
it
were
not
fit
for
men
to
be
judging
;
that
she
had
had
her
sore
trial
,
as
well
as
Hepburn
hisself
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
lady
asked
,
"
What
became
of
the
wife
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
was
a
pale
,
sad
woman
,
allays
dressed
in
black
.
<EOS>
I
can
just
remember
her
when
I
was
a
little
child
,
but
she
died
before
her
daughter
was
well
grown
up
;
and
Miss
Rose
took
t
'
lassie
,
as
had
always
been
like
her
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Rose
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hester
Rose
!
<EOS>
have
yo
'
niver
heared
of
Hester
Rose
,
she
as
founded
t
'
alms
-
houses
for
poor
disabled
sailors
and
soldiers
on
t
'
Horncastle
road
?
<EOS>
There
's
a
piece
o
'
<EOS>
stone
in
front
to
say
that
"
This
building
is
erected
in
memory
of
P.
H.
"
 
and
some
folk
will
have
it
<EOS>
P.

stands
for

o

th

man
as
was
starved
to
death

<EOS>
And
the
daughter

"
  
<EOS>
"
One
o

th
