,
like
prologues
,
have
nearly
gone
out
of
fashion
;
but
theEditor
of
Lloyd
’s
Penny
Weekly
Miscellany
feels
,
that
upon
thecompletion
of
the
first
volume
of
his
labours
,
he
is
bound
to
saysomething
to
his
patrons
,
if
it
is
but
to
thank
them
most
heartily
andsincerely
for
a
degree
of
patronage
,
such
as
he
may
venture
to
say
,
few
,
if
any
,
periodical
publications
have
been
able
to
boast
of
.
<EOS>
Whenwe
first
launched
our
Miscellany
upon
the
stream
of
time
,
we
weregratified
to
find
that
the
breath
of
popular
applause
filled
its
sails
,
and
bore
it
gallantly
forward
past
many
a
proud
competitor
;
and
we
havefound
,
by
the
experience
of
twelve
months
,
that
the
fair
wind
thaturged
us
onwards
was
not
“
a
mere
passing
gale
,
”
for
each
week
hasmaterially
increased
our
circulation
,
until
the
Miscellany
now
occupiesa
place
in
the
periodical
literature
of
Great
Britain
(
and
,
in
fact
,
wherever
the
English
language
is
spoken
)
,
which
may
well
fill
thehearts
of
both
Publisher
and
Editor
with
the
most
grateful
feelingstowards
their
best
friends
—
the
Public
.
<EOS>
Having
said
thus
much
of
the
past
,
it
behoves
us
to
say
something
ofthat
which
is
to
come
.
<EOS>
First
and
foremost
then
,
those
pens
which
havealready
received
the
meed
of
popular
applause
,
will
still
continue
to“Weave
<EOS>

CHAPTER
I.The
Storm.—The
Old
Smithy.—A
Deed
of
Blood.—The
Death
Cry.—The
Child
ofthe
Dead.—Remorse
and
Despair
.
<EOS>
It
was
towards
the
close
of
the
year
1795
that
a
storm
,
unequalled
induration
and
fury
,
swept
over
one
of
the
most
fertile
districts
ofEngland
,
spreading
consternation
and
dismay
among
the
inhabitants
ofseveral
villages
,
and
destroying
in
a
few
short
hours
the
hopes
of
manyan
industrious
family
,
who
looked
to
the
nearly
ripened
grain
of
thefertile
fields
for
their
means
of
subsistence
through
the
coming
winter
.
<EOS>
The
day
had
been
lowering
and
overcast
.
<EOS>
An
unusual
sultriness
hadpervaded
the
air
,
and
although
more
than
sixty
miles
of
hill
and
dalelaid
between
the
spot
to
which
we
allude
and
the
Northern
Ocean
,
whichwashes
the
eastern
shore
of
England
,
several
sea
birds
(
a
most
unwontedsight
)
had
flown
,
screeching
and
wailing
,
over
the
rich
corn
-
fields
andpromising
orchards
.
<EOS>
The
day
had
worn
gradually
on
,
and
it
was
not
until
the
sun
was
lostamid
a
mass
of
fiery
clouds
in
the
glowing
west
that
any
preciseindications
of
the
approaching
tempest
presented
themselves
.
<EOS>
Then
,
however
,
when
the
long
shadows
from
the
trees
began
to
lose
theiridentity
in
the
general
gloom
of
the
rapidly
approaching
night
,
asingular
moaning
wind
began
to
blow
from
the
north
-
west
.
<EOS>
The
cattle
showed
alarm
and
uneasiness
—
the
birds
flew
low
anduncertainly
—
horses
trembled
in
their
stables
,
and
the
hoarse
scream
ofvarious
large
birds
of
prey
as
they
flew
over
the
farm
-
house
,
orsettled
on
the
roofs
,
had
a
peculiarly
discordant
effect
.
<EOS>
It
would
seemas
if
there
was
something
in
the
air
which
enabled
the
inferior
animalsto
know
and
dread
the
awful
strife
of
the
elements
which
was
about
toensue
.
<EOS>
The
glowing
clouds
in
the
west
rapidly
disappeared
,
and
the
night
fellover
the
land
as
if
a
black
pall
had
been
suddenly
cast
over
the
faceof
Nature
.
<EOS>
The
wind
momentarily
increased
in
violence
.
<EOS>
Now
it
moanedlike
an
evil
spirit
round
the
gable
ends
of
the
houses
;
then
again
,
with
a
wild
whistle
and
a
rushing
sound
,
it
would
sweep
past
thelatticed
windows
like
a
wild
animal
seeking
its
prey
.
<EOS>
Occasionally
there
would
be
a
lull
in
the
tempest
,
and
in
one
of
thesethe
heavens
were
lit
up
with
a
flash
of
lightning
of
such
power
andbrilliancy
,
that
all
who
saw
it
closed
instantly
their
eyes
in
dismay
,
and
trembled
with
apprehension
.
<EOS>
Then
followed
thunder
—
thunder
thatshook
the
houses
to
their
foundations
,
and
boomed
and
rattled
in
thesky
with
so
awful
a
sound
that
many
of
the
villagers
sunk
upon
theirknees
to
pray
,
for
they
thought
the
end
of
the
world
was
at
hand
,
andthey
should
never
see
the
blessed
sun
again
.
<EOS>
Mothers
clasped
theirscreaming
children
to
their
breasts
,
and
wept
in
bitterness
of
heart
.
<EOS>
Strong
men
shook
with
fear
,
and
when
again
the
wind
arose
,
and
,
like
agiant
’s
arm
,
levelled
hedges
,
trees
,
haystacks
,
and
some
houses
,
a
cryof
dismay
arose
from
the
villagers
,
and
the
bells
were
rung
in
therural
churches
.
<EOS>
Some
screamed
—
some
prayed
—
some
wept
and
rung
theirhands
.
<EOS>
All
was
horror
,
uncertainty
,
and
despair!The
storm
had
lasted
several
hours
,
and
still
,
the
forked
lightningdarted
in
livid
streaks
from
cloud
to
cloud
.
<EOS>
The
awful
thunder
filledthe
air
with
its
hundred
echoes
,
and
the
wind
swept
over
a
scene
ofdesolation
,
for
the
smiling
corn
-
fields
were
no
more
;
the
laden
fruittrees
were
levelled
with
the
soil
,
and
many
a
cottage
had
its
humblethatch
torn
off
,
and
presented
but
its
bare
walls
to
the
moaning
blast
.
<EOS>
The
principle
fury
of
the
land
storm
seemed
to
have
been
levelled
at
alittle
village
which
occupied
the
gentle
slope
of
a
beautiful
andfertile
valley
,
some
few
miles
from
Ashby
-
de
-
la
-
Zouch
,
and
through
thelowest
portion
of
which
a
branch
of
the
river
Derwent
wound
itsserpentine
course
.
<EOS>
The
village
was
called
Learmont
,
from
the
name
of
anoble
family
who
,
since
the
Norman
conquest
,
had
been
the
owners
of
theland
.
<EOS>
There
was
scarcely
a
house
,
from
the
humblest
cottage
to
the
lordlymansion
of
the
Learmonts
,
which
had
not
suffered
by
the
hurricane
;
andto
add
to
the
dismay
of
the
inhabitants
,
who
in
fear
and
dread
hadrushed
from
their
homes
,
there
arose
about
the
hour
of
midnight
thedreadful
cry
of
fire!That
fearful
cry
struck
terror
to
every
heart
,
and
those
who
had
breathto
shriek
joined
the
shout
,
and
“
fire
!
<EOS>
fire
!
”
<EOS>
passed
from
mouth
tomouth
,
in
all
the
different
tones
and
cadences
of
fear
and
hopelessness
.
<EOS>
All
uncertainty
as
to
the
precise
locality
of
the
fire
was
soonremoved
,
for
the
flames
from
a
large
irregular
building
,
<EOS>
standingsomewhat
apart
from
the
other
houses
,
quickly
marked
it
as
the
spot
ofthe
conflagration
.
<EOS>
“It
’s
at
the
Old
Smithy
,
”
cried
a
dozen
voices
.
<EOS>
The
words
had
scarcely
passed
their
lips
,
when
a
woman
darted
into
thecentre
of
the
throng
,
shrieking
wildly,—“Aye

<EOS>
”She
<EOS>
was
about
to
bound
off
in
the
direction
of
the
blazing
house
,
leaving
her
listeners
aghast
at
her
terrible
denunciations
,
when
a
manof
forbidding
aspect
and
Herculean
build
rushed
into
the
midst
of
thethrong
of
villagers
round
her
,
and
with
one
blow
of
his
clenched
handstruck
her
insensible
to

earth

<EOS>
A
cry
of
“
shame

<EOS>
shame

”
<EOS>
arose
,
and
a
young
man
stepping
forward
,
exclaimed,—“Unmanly

<EOS>

“He

“Is

suddenly

<EOS>
darted
off
in
the
direction
of
the
blazing

and
,
as
if
by
oneimpulse
,
the
villagers
followed
her
,
shouting,—“To
the
Smithy
—
to
the
Smithy!”The
building
,
which
was
in
flames
,
had
at
one
time
evidently
been
of
amuch
higher
character
than
its
present
appearance
warranted
.
<EOS>
Itconsisted
of
a
large
uninhabited
house
,
with
two
wings
,
one
of
whichhad
been
converted
into
a
smithy
,
and
was
in
the
occupation
of
AndrewBritton
,
the
smith
,
who
stood
high
in
favour
of
the
then
SquireLearmont
,
whose
property
the
old
house
was
.
<EOS>
The
fire
was
in
the
other
wing
to
that
which
had
been
converted
into
asmithy
,
and
when
the
villagers
arrived
they
found
it
so
enveloped
inflames
,
that
any
attempt
to
save
it
seemed
perfectly
in
vain
.
<EOS>
“Blood

blood

cried
Mad

rushing
close
to
the

<EOS>
“
I

<EOS>
A

<EOS>
Hark!—hark!”The

were
horror

stricken
by
hearing
piercing
shrieks
comingfrom
the
interior
of
the
burning
house
.
<EOS>
“There

cried
the
maniac
exultingly
;

“

the

escape
his
lips

there
dashed
from
among
theburning
ruins
a
figure
which
might
well
strike
terror
into
every
heart
.
<EOS>
It
was
that
of
a
man
,
but
so
blackened

scorched
was
he
by
the
firethat
he
scarcely
looked
human

<EOS>
“Help

<EOS>
Help

”
<EOS>
he
screamed
.
<EOS>
“
Murder

<EOS>
Murder!”Every
heart
was
paralysed
as
he
dashed
into
the
centre
of
the
throng

screaming
with
pain

<EOS>
“The
child

<EOS>
The
child
!
”
<EOS>
he
screamed
.
<EOS>
“
The
child
of

dead

save

hands
were
immediately
stretched
forward
to
take
from
his
arms
aninfant
that
the
villagers
now
perceived
he
carried
.
<EOS>
He
resigned
his
charge
,
and
then
flinging
his
arms
above
his
head
,
hecried,—“Save

Oh

”His
<EOS>
last
words
rung
faintly
on
the
ears
of
the
horrified
crowd
,
forhaving
given
up
the
child
,
he
then
bounded
onwards
,
and
was
soon
lostto
sight
and
hearing
in
the
darkness
of
a
plantation
which
grew
on
theborder
of
the
stream

watered
the

Britton
,
the

glared
with
eyes
of
fury
after

shriekingfugitive
,
then
clenching
his
hand

he
shook
it
wildly
in
the
air
,
andbreathing
a
bitter
curse
,
turned
from
the
burning
portion
of
the
house

and
dashed
into

<EOS>
The
startling
and
singular
events
at
the
Old
Smithy
had
the
effect
ofdistracting
in
some
measure
the
attention
of
the
affrighted
inhabitantsof

from
the
fury
of
the
tempest
,
which
was
still
raging
,
although
with
diminished
rage
,
around
their
humble
dwellings
.
<EOS>
The
forked
lightning
was
not
so
frequent
in
its
flashes

and
thethunder
seemed
to
be
passing

Still
it

terror

not
until
the
wind
hadsensibly
abated
,
and
a
few
heavy
drops

fell
splashing

storm
had
done
its
worst
.
<EOS>
The
child
which
had
been
brought
from
the
burning
house
,
in
so
awfuland
mysterious
a
manner
appeared
to
be
little
more
than
one
year
old
,
and
it
was
perfectly
unknown
to
all
in
the
village
;
neither
could
anyone
give
a
guess
as
to
who
the
strange
man
could
be
,
who
with
suchfrantic
cries
of
pain
and
remorse
,
had
appeared
for
a
moment
amongstthem
.
<EOS>
The
wing
of
the
ancient
building
in
which
the
fire
had
originated
,
alone
had
suffered
from
the
conflagration
.
<EOS>
It
lay
a
heap
of
smoulderingruins
,
but
the
rest
of
the
large
rambling
habitation
,
including
theSmithy
,
was
quite
uninjured
.
<EOS>
The
child
was
surrendered
by
common
consent
to
the
care
of
akind
-
hearted
woman
,
by
the
name
of
Dame
Tatton
,
who
was
a
widow
.
<EOS>
Shelooked
with
an
eye
of
trembling
pity
upon
the
little
innocent
whonestled
in
her
bosom
in
sobbing
fear
.
<EOS>
The
little
girl
,
for
such
she
was
,
showed
evidently
by
her
attire
thatshe
had
been
in
the
care
of
those
of
a
far
higher
rank
in
life
than
thekind
-
hearted
,
but
humble
cottager
,
who
now
strove
to
allay
her
childishterror
.
<EOS>
Around
the
neck
of
the
infant
was
a
small
necklace
of
pearls
,
and
aboutits
attire
<EOS>
generally
there
were
ample
indications
of
wealth
.
<EOS>
The
little
innocent
soon
sobbed
itself
to
sleep
upon
the
breast
of
DameTatton
,
and
the
village
gossips
,
after
resolving
in
the
morning
to
goin
a
body
to
the
Squire
Learmont
and
ask
his
advice
,
or
rathercommands
,
concerning
the
disposal
of
the
babe
that
had
been
somysteriously
thrown
upon
their
hands
,
dispersed
to
seek
that
reposethey
were
so
much
in
need
of
.
<EOS>
Every
one
naturally
thought
that
Andrew
Britton
,
the
smith
,
knewsomething
of
the
mysterious
man
and
the
child
;
but
none
would
ventureto
the
dwelling
of
“
The
Savage
,
”
as
he
was
generally
called
,
to
make
aninquiry
,
for
his
ferocity
was
too
well
known
not
to
be
universallydreaded
.
<EOS>
The
storm
had
nearly
gone
.
<EOS>
A
heavy
fall
of
rain
was
splashing
on
themeadows
,
and
beaten
down
vegetation
,
and
all
was
still
in
Learmont
tillthe
morning
<EOS>
’s
sun
rose
on
the
wreck
which
the
tempest
had
made
in
thegreen
valley
that
the
day
before
was
redolent
of
peace
and
plenty
.
<EOS>
Young
and
old
then
sought
the
cottage
of
Dame
Tatton
.
<EOS>
They
knocked
atfirst
gently
,
then
more
loudly
,
but
no
one
answered
.
<EOS>
“My
mind
misgives
me
,
”
cried
the
young
man
who
had
the
precedingevening
spoken
so
boldly
to
the
smith—“my
mind
<EOS>
misgives
me
;
but
thereis
something
wrong
.
<EOS>
Let
us
force
the
door
,
my
masters
.
<EOS>
”“Nay
,
Frank
,
”
said
an
old
man
.
<EOS>
“
The
widow
sleeps
soundly
after
thestorm
.
<EOS>
Ye
are
too
hasty
—
far
too
hasty
,
Frank
Hartleton
.
<EOS>
”“Nay
to
thee
!
”
<EOS>
cried
the
impetuous
youth
.
<EOS>
“
’
<EOS>
Tis
but
a
broken
panel
atthe
utmost
,
and
we
do
force
the
dame
’s
door
,
and
that
we
can
any
of
usmend
again
.
<EOS>
What
say
you
masters?”“Aye
,
truly
,
”
replied
a
little
man
with
a
red
night
-
cap—“spokentruly
—
most
sagely
spoken
.
<EOS>
”“But
<EOS>
will
the
squire
approve
of
it
,
think
ye
?
”
<EOS>
suggested
one
.
<EOS>
“By
<EOS>
my
shears
<EOS>
I
thought
not
of
that
,
”
murmured
the
little
man
,
who
wasthe
garment
fashioner
of
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“Knock
<EOS>
again
,
”
cried
several
.
<EOS>
Frank
Hartleton
knocked
loudly
,
and
<EOS>
shouted,—“Dame
Tatton
—
Dame
Tatton
,
I
say
;
hast
taken
a
sleeping
draught?”No
voice
replied
.
<EOS>
All
was
as
still
as
the
grave
within
the
cottage
.
<EOS>
Frank
now
placed
his
foot
against
the
frail
door
,
and
with
one
vigorouspush
he
sent
it
flat
upon
the
earthen
floor
of
the
cottage
,
andimmediately
striding
over
it
,
he
entered
the
humble
dwelling
.
<EOS>
The
villagers
hesitated
for
a
moment
,
in
order
to
be
quite
sure
therewas
no
immediate
danger
in
following
Frank
Hartleton
,
and
then
theyquickly
thronged
the
little
cottage
,
which
could
boast
of
but
two
smallapartments
,
so
that
the
whole
interior
was
in
a
very
few
minutesexamined
.
<EOS>
The
cottage
was
tenantless
.
<EOS>
Dame
Tatton
and
her
infant
charge
had
bothdisappeared
.
<EOS>
The
simple
rustics
gaped
at
each
other
in
speechless
amazement
.
<EOS>
The
bedhad
evidently
been
occupied
,
but
there
was
no
sign
of
confusion
orviolence
—
all
was
orderly
and
neat
—
nothing
was
removed
or
disarranged
.
<EOS>
Acanary
bird
was
singing
gaily
in
a
wicker
cage
;
a
cat
slept
on
thehearth
;
but
the
Widow
Tatton
and
the
mysterious
child
—
now
moremysterious
than
ever
—
had
both
disappeared
.
<EOS>
“I
can
not
account
for
this
,
”
said
Frank
Hartleton
.
<EOS>
“
By
Heavens
it
’s
themost
singular
thing
I
ever
heard
of
.
<EOS>
”“The
place
has
a
strange
look
,
”
cried
one
.
<EOS>
“A
<EOS>
strange
look
!
”
<EOS>
said
the
rest
in
chorus
.
<EOS>
“
So
indeed
it
has
.
”“Strange
<EOS>
nonsense
,
”
cried
Frank
.
<EOS>
“
So
you
are
frightened
all
of
you
<EOS>
atan
empty

room
are
you?”“Master
Frank
,
”
suddenly
shouted
one
,
“
look
ye
here
<EOS>
,
you
were
always
amain
scholar
.
<EOS>
”Frank
<EOS>
turned
his
attention
to
a
part
of
the
plaster
wall
indicated
byhim
who
spoke
,
and
on
it
was
traced
,
as
if
rapidly
with
a
thumb
orfinger
nail
these
words,—“Help
—
the
Squire
and
the
Savage
have—”and
that
was
all
.
<EOS>
Whoever
had
written
that
hurried
scrawl
had
not
hadtime
to
finish
the
sentence
which
would
probably
have
thrown
some
lightupon
the
inexplicable
affair
.
<EOS>
“There
has
been
some
foul
play
,
I
am
convinced
,
”
cried
Frank
.
<EOS>
“
Myfriends
,
let
us
go
at
once
and
confront
the
squire
.
<EOS>
”“You
need
not
go
far
,
insolent
hind

”
<EOS>
cried
a
hoarse
voice
,
and
Frankturned
suddenly
to
where
the
sound
proceeded
from
,
saw
Squire
Learmonthimself
standing
upon
the
threshold
of
the
cottage
.
<EOS>
Squire
Learmont
of
Learmont
,
only
as
he
preferred
being
called
,
was
aman
far
above
the
ordinary
standard
of
height
;
his
figure
,
however
,
wasthin
and
emaciated
,
which
,
coupled
with
his
height
,
gave
him
anungainly
appearance
.
<EOS>
His
complexion
was
a
dead
white
—
there
was
nothingof
the
sallow
or
brown
in
it
—
it
was
ghastly
white
,
and
contrasting
withhis
lank
black
hair
which
hung
far
down
from
his
head
straight
andsnake
-
like
without
the
shadow
of
a
curl
,
it
had
a
hideous
corpse
-
likeappearance
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
am
glad
,
”
said
Frank
,
when
he
had
recovered
his
first
surprise
atthe
sudden
appearance
of
Learmont
,
“
I
am
glad
we
have
not
far
to
go
,
for
the
business
is
urgent
.
<EOS>
”Learmont
waved
his
hand
for
him
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
“Last
<EOS>
night
there
was
a
storm
,
”
continued
Frank
.
<EOS>
“Indeed
!
”
<EOS>
sneered
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“
That
is
news
this
morning
.
<EOS>
”Frank
<EOS>
Hartleton
felt
his
cheek
flush
with
colour
,
but
he
controlled
hispassion
and
continued,—“A
wing
of
the
old
house
adjoining
the
smithy
was
on
fire
—
<EOS>
the
house
Imean
that
has
been
shut
up
so
long
because
it
is
thought—”“Who
dared
think
?
”
<EOS>
cried
Learmont
,
in
a
voice
of
violent
anger
.
<EOS>
“
Whodared
think
of
me—”“Of
you
,
sir?”“Aye
—
who
dared—?”“It
was
of
the
house
I
spoke

<EOS>
”“But

<EOS>

<EOS>
cried
Learmont

<EOS>
“Truly

<EOS>
”“Then
<EOS>
on
with
your
speech
,
sir
,
and
draw
no

from

<EOS>
The
wing
of
my
house
was
on
fire
.
<EOS>
Enough
—
what
followed?”“A
man
rushed
from
it
in
mortal
agony
of
mind
and
body
,
carrying
achild—”“Well
—
<EOS>
well!”“That
<EOS>
child
was
given

<EOS>
Now

have
both
disappeared

<EOS>
”“I

<EOS>
cried
Learmont

<EOS>
“What

<EOS>
You

”“And
<EOS>
so

I
presume

”
sneered
Learmont
,
“
I
must
charge
myself
to
bringback
every
old

who
disappears
from
her

is
an
inscription
on

wall

said
Frank
,
“
which
seems
torefer—”“Ah
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Learmont
,
striding
forward
,
and
reading
the
few
words
thathad
been
scratched
on
the
wall
.
<EOS>
“
Well
,
what
then?”“That
I
ask
you
Squire
Learmont
.
<EOS>
”“Then
I
reply
,
nothing
.
<EOS>
Will
you
finish
that
sentence?”“Certainly
not
.
<EOS>
”“Then
<EOS>
what
further
have
you
to
say
to
me?”Frank
was
rather
confounded
by
the
manner
of
the
squire
and
was
silent
.
<EOS>
“Young
man
,
”
said
Learmont
,
“
your
father
did
a
service
to
theLearmonts
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
know
it
,
”
said
Frank
.
<EOS>
“In
return
for

the
Learmonts
gave

<EOS>
”“’Tis

cried
Frank

<EOS>
“
The

not
overpaid

Myfather

”“True

”
sneered
Learmont
,
“
but
beware!”“Beware
of
what?”“The
house
that
was
powerful
enough
to

“Be

said
Learmont

as
with
an
angry

he
strode
to

the

He
turned

Ten
years
had
rolled
away
since
the
storm
,
so
memorable
on
account
ofthe
mysterious
incidents
connected
with
it
,
had
swept
over
the
villageof
Learmont
.
<EOS>
Ten
weary
years
to
some
—
to
others
,
years
of
sunshine
andjoy
—
but
of
such
chequered
materials
are
human
lives
.
<EOS>
But
little
changehad
taken
place
in
the
village
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
aged
inhabitants
haddropped
into
the
silent
tomb
,
and
some
of
the
young
had
grown
grey
withcare
—
nothing
,
however
,
had
occurred
to
cast
any
light
upon
the
dark
andmysterious
occurrences
of
the
well
-
remembered
evening
of
the
storm
.
<EOS>
Thesmith
,
Andrew
Britton
,
still
plied
his
hammer
,
and
the
mass
of
ruinswhich
had
once
been
the
wing
of
the
old
house
he
inhabited
,
still
layas
they
had
fallen
—
only
they
were
overgrown
with
wild
weeds
,
and
coarsevegetation
.
<EOS>
The
cottage
of
Dame
Tatton
remained
uninhabited
,
for
no
onewould
live
in
what
they
considered
an
ill
-
omened
and
mysteriousresidence
.
<EOS>
It
had
,
therefore
,
remained
locked
up
since
theunaccountable
disappearance
of
its
last
occupant
,
and
in
course
of
timethe
villagers
began
to
regard
it
with
a
superstitious
feeling
offear
—
some
even
asserted
that
lights
had
been
seen
at
night
gleamingthrough
the
narrow
casements
—
others
reported
that
strange
sounds
ofpain
and
distress
had
been
heard
proceeding
from
the
humbledwelling
—
but
whether
or
not
these
sights
and
sounds
had
really
attackedthe
senses
of
the
inhabitants
of
Learmont
,
<EOS>
certain
it
was
that
thecottage
began
by
degrees
to
be
regarded
with
as
much
dislike
and
dreadas
the
large
rambling
habitation
of
Britton
,
the
smith
.
<EOS>
The
child
too
—
the
infant
who
had
been
rescued
from
the
flames
was
neverheard
of
,
and
the
storm
—
the
fire
—
the
burnt
and
shrieking
man
—
the
childand
Dame
Tatton
,
became
all
leading
topics
in
the
gossips
of
thevillagers
around
their
fire
-
sides
,
as
well
as
in
the
old
oaken
parlourof
<EOS>
the
“
Rose
,
”
an
ancient
ale
house
,
which
stood
in
the
very
centre
ofLearmont
,
and
had
so
stood
for
time
out
of
mind
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
the
depth
of
winter
,
ten
years
and
some
months
after
thestorm
,
that
a
goodly
collection
of
the
village
gossips
—
scandal
-
mongersand
topers
were
seated
around
the
cheerful
,
crackling
,
blazing
fire
inthe
before
-
mentioned
oaken
parlour
of
the
“
Rose
.
”
<EOS>
The
hour
was
waxinglate
,
but
the
room
was
so
warm
and
comfortable
,
the
ale
so
good
,
andthe
conversation
so
deeply
interesting
,
that
no
one
seemed
inclined
tomove
,
but
upon
the
principle
of
“
let
well
alone
,
”
preferred
the
presentgood
quarters
to
a
turn
out
in
the
snow
.
<EOS>
“How
long
has
it
snowed
now
,
Tom
?
”
said
a
jolly
farmer
-
looking
man
,
without
taking
the
pipe
from
his
capacious
mouth
.
<EOS>
“It
beginned
,
”
replied
Tom
the
waiter
,
ostler
,
and
fag
in
general
.
<EOS>
“
Itbeginned
at
half
arter

<EOS>
It’ssnewed

”“Oh

said
an
old
man
.
<EOS>
“
Forty
years

when
I

a

“
When

against

faint

as

with

proceeded
to

,
in
a

momentsushered
into
the
warm
parlour
a
tall
man

who
was
so
covered
with
snow

that
it
was
difficult

make
out

<EOS>
He
cast
<EOS>
a

uneasy
glance
round
him

as
he
entered
theparlour

then
taking
a
chair
in

he
turned
to
Tom

So

perfectly

“A

“Eh?—yes

<EOS>
“Fine?”“Oh

<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
company
looked
very
eagerly
at
each
other
,
and
then
at
theabstracted
stranger
in
great
wonderment
and
intense
curiosity

<EOS>
Tom
now
entered
with
the
brandy

<EOS>
The
stranger
eagerly
clutched
thelittle
pewter
measure
in
which
it
was
brought
and
toss’d
off
itscontents
at
once

<EOS>
Then
he
drew
a
long
breath

turning
to
Tom

hesaid:—“Stay

I
<EOS>

<EOS>
said
Tom

as
the

paused
a

<EOS>
“Is

“And

““Oh

To

<EOS>
”“The

”“Ten

<EOS>
“Yes

”So

threw
down
a

The

CHAPTER
IV.The
Old
Smithy.—A
Lone
Man.—The
<EOS>
Alarm.—The
Mysterious
Conference.—Guiltand
Misery
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
hammer
of
the
smith
which
had
sounded
on
the
night
air
,
andthe
clangour
of
which
had
reached
the
ears
of
the
frequenters
of
thesnug
oaken
parlour
of
the
Rose
Inn
.
<EOS>
The
Smithy
was
of
great
extent
,
for
it
occupied
nearly
the
whole
groundfloor
of
the
wing
of
the
dilapidated
mansion
in
which
Britton
resided
.
<EOS>
There
were
about
the
stained
windows
and
carved
oaken
chimney
-
pieceample
evidences
of
ancient
grandeur
in
the
place
,
and
it
was
not
alittle
singular
to
notice
the
strange
effect
produced
by
the
mixture
ofthe
rude
implements
of
the
smith
with
the
remains
of
the
formermagnificence
of
the
ancient
hall
.
<EOS>
A
blazing
fire
was
roaring
on
the
hearth
,
and
by
it
stood
AndrewBritton
,
the
smith
,
or
“
The
Savage
,
”
as
he
was
called
,
in
consequenceof
the
known
brutality
of
his
disposition
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
other
light
inthe
large
apartment
but
what
proceeded
from
the
fire
,
and
as
it
flaredand
roared
up
the
spacious
chimney
it
cast
strange
shadows
on
the
duskywalls
,
and
lit
up
the
repulsive
countenance
of
the
smith
withunearthly
-
looking
brilliancy
.
<EOS>
A
weighty
forge
hammer
was
in
his
hand
,
and
he
was
busily
turning
in
the
glowing
embers
a
piece
of
iron
uponwhich
he
had
been
operating
.
<EOS>
“Curses
on
his
caution
,
”
he
muttered
,
as
if
following
up
some
previoustrain
of
thought
.
<EOS>
“
And
yet
—
yet
without
the
work
—
I
think
I
might
go
mad;drink
and
work
.
<EOS>
Thus
pass
my
days
;
aye
,
and
my
nights
too
.
<EOS>
He
is
rightthere
;
I
should
go
mad
without
the
work
.
<EOS>
I
drink
—
drink
till
my
brainfeels
hot
and
scorching
—
then
this
relieves
me
—
this
hammer
,
and
I
fancyas
<EOS>
I
bring
it
clashing
down
upon
the
anvil
<EOS>
that
—
ha
!
<EOS>
ha!—that
some
one’shead
is
underneath
it
.
<EOS>
And
most
of
all
,
is
it
rare
and
pleasant
toimagine
it
<EOS>
his
head
,
who
turned
a
cowardly
craven
when
he
had
work
todo
which
required
a
cool
head
,
and
a
quick
hand
.
<EOS>
Curses
on
him
!
<EOS>
Curses!”He
lifted
the
immense
hammer
which
no
ordinary
man
could
have
wielded
,
and
brought
it
down
upon
the
anvil
with
so
stunning
a
sound
,
that
itawakened
startling
echoes
all
over
the
old
house
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
the
smith
stood
in
the
attitude
of
attention
,
for
as
thesounds
<EOS>
he
had
himself
produced
died
away
,
he
fancied
there
mingled
withthem
a
knocking
at
the
door
of
the
smithy
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
moments
he
listened
attentively
,
and
then
became
confirmed
inhis
opinion
,
that
some
one
was
knocking
at
his
door
.
<EOS>
“A
visitor
to
me
?
”
<EOS>
he
muttered
,
“
and
at
this
hour
—
well
,
well
—
be
it
whomit
<EOS>
may
,
he
shall
enter
.
<EOS>
Whether
he
goes
forth
again
or
not
is
anotherconsideration
.
<EOS>
Men
call
me
a
savage
.
<EOS>
Let
those
beware
who
seek
my
den
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
walked
to
the
door
of
the
smithy
,
and
removing
an
iron
bar
whichhung
across
it
,
he
flung
it
wide
open
,
saying
,
“
Who
knocks
at
AndrewBritton
’s
door?”The
mysterious
stranger
who
had
created
so
much
sensation
at
the“Rose
,
”
stood
on
the
threshold
.
<EOS>
His
form
was
clearly
defined
upon
thesnow
,
and
the
smith
started
as
he
said,—“Andrew
Britton
,
do
you
know
<EOS>
me?”“Know
you
?
”
said
Britton
.
<EOS>
“Aye
!
<EOS>
Look
at
me
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
man
took
off
his
hat
as
he
spoke
,
and
stood
in
the
full
glare
ofthe
flickering
fire
light
.
<EOS>
A
dark
scowl
came
over
the
brow
of
the
smith
,
and
he
still
continuedsilent
while
the
man
repeated
,
“
<EOS>
Andrew
Britton
,
do
you
know
me?”“Know
you
?
”
<EOS>
cried
Britton
,
with
a
voice
of
rage
almost
goaded
to
fury
.
<EOS>
“Yes
,
I
do
know
you
—
robber
—
thief
—
<EOS>
paltry
wretch
that
had
not
courage—”“Hush
,
Andrew
Britton
,
”
said
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
“
I
have
travelled
many
wearymiles
to
visit
thee
.
<EOS>
From
the
moment
that
a
stranger
told
me
that
theclank
of
your
hammer
still
sounded
through
the
village
of
Learmont
,
Iguessed
how
you
had
been
requited

<EOS>
I
resolved
to
seek
you

tell

<EOS>
I

”Owing
to
the
position
in
which
the
man
stood
,
the
red
glare
of
thesmith
’s
fire
fell
full
upon
his
working
features
,
and
after
regardingthem
attentively
for
some
moments
,
Britton
spoke
in
a
calmer
tone
thanhe
had
used
before
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
think
I
understand
you
now

he
said

<EOS>
“
Come

<EOS>
”“One
word
before
I
accept
your
hospitality
,
”
said
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
“Such
conversation
as
ours
,
”
remarked
the
smith
,
“
is
safest
carried
onwithin
.
<EOS>
”“But
<EOS>
what
I
have
to
say
is
safest
said
now
,
and
more
to
the
purpose
,
asI
stand
here
upon
your
threshold

<EOS>
”“Say

cried
Britton
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
“’Tis

Inmy

a

’”The
dark
countenance
of
the
smith
turned
to
a
pallid
hue
as
thestranger
spoke
,
and
his
gigantic
frame
perceptibly
trembled
as
he
saidin
a
low
husky
whisper
,
“
And
that

contains—.”“A
confession

<EOS>
”“You

you

safe

deeply
laid
a

nay

I
think
I
should
have
been
safe

I
explainedto

Britton

the
motive
of
my

hither

the
mind
is
neverso
free

act

”“Come

Come

”“Freely

said
the

stepping
into
the

strange
abode

<EOS>
Britton
carefully
barred
the
door
,
and
without
speaking
for
a
fewmoments
,
he
threw
coals
upon
his
forge
fire
and
stirred
up
the
glowingembers
until
a
cheerful
blaze
of
light
illuminated
the
whole
interiorof

<EOS>
The
stranger

from

oaken
door
at
the
further
end
of
the
ancient
hall

and
hecontinued
to
gaze
at
it
,
as
if
under
the
influence
of
some
fascinationwhich
he
could
not
resist
.
<EOS>
“Britton
<EOS>
“
he
said
at
length
,
while
a
shudder
for
one
instant
convulsedhis
frame
,
“
have
you
ever
passed
through
that
door
since
—
since—”“Since
the
night
of
the
storm
?
”
said
Britton
.
<EOS>
“
Yes
,
I
have
passedthrough
it
.
<EOS>
”“You
are
bold
.
<EOS>
”“I
had
a
motive
,
and
since
your
candour
has
been
such
as
to
tell
me
ofthat
little
contrivance
of
yours
about
the
packet
you
have
left
withsuch
urgent
directions

I
will
tell
you
my

<EOS>
Ha!We

shall
better
understand
our

<EOS>
”“What
<EOS>
was
the
motive?”“Can
you
form
no
guess?”“I
can
not
;
how
—
how
should
I
<EOS>
Britton?”“Did
<EOS>
you
lose
nothing
,
ten
years
since?”“Yes
—
yes
—
I
did
lose
a
knife
—
but
not
here
—
not
here!”“You
did
lose
it
here

<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
you
found
it
,
good
Britton
,
and
will
give
it
to
me

’
<EOS>
Twas
an
oldkeepsake
from
a

<EOS>
You
will
give
it
to
me
,
Andrew
Britton?”“Ha
!
<EOS>
Ha
!
”
<EOS>
laughed
the
smith
in
his
discordant
manner
.
<EOS>
“
You
know

free
when
safety
is
doubly
secured
.
<EOS>
”“The
knife
—
the
knife
!
”
<EOS>
cried
the
stranger
,
earnestly
.
<EOS>
“
My
name
is
—
is—”“On
the
handle
,
”
added
Britton
,
“
which
makes
it
all
the
more
valuable
.
<EOS>
You
say
it
was
a
keepsake

<EOS>
It
shall
be
a
keepsake
still
.
<EOS>
I
will
keep
itfor
my
own
sake

<EOS>
I
would
not
barter
it
for
its
worth
in
gold

”“Perhaps
<EOS>
you
have
not
got
it
.
”“Do
<EOS>
not
please
yourself
with
such
a
supposition
,
I
will
show
it
to
you
.
<EOS>
”Britton
walked
to
an
old
press
which
stood
in
an
obscure
and
darkcorner
of
the
room
,
and
then
returned
with
a
large
knife
in
his
hand
,
the
blade
of
which
opened
and
remained
fast
by
touching
a
spring
.
<EOS>
“Do
<EOS>
you
know
that
?
”
<EOS>
he
said
,
holding
it
to
the
eyes
of
his
visitor
.
<EOS>
Theman
groaned
.
<EOS>
“Give
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
give
it
to
me
,
Britton
,
”
he
said
.
<EOS>
“No
,
”
said
the
smith
.
<EOS>
“
You
have
taught
me
a
lesson
,
I
shall
write
aconfession
and
wrap
it
round
this

anything

happen
to
me

<EOS>
Do
youunderstand

my
friend?”The
man
’s
lips
became
white
with
fear
,
and
he
faltered—“If

if
you
will
not
give
it
me
—
take
it
away

out
of

Curses

<EOS>
Curses

<EOS>
That
I
should
have
come
thus
far
to
be
sotortured

<EOS>
”“Nay

”
said
the
smith
,
in
a
tone
of
sneering
exultation
,
“
you
shall
beconvinced

<EOS>
Look
at
that

stained

<EOS>
”“Away

<EOS>
Away

”
shrieked
the
stranger
,
covering
his
eyes
withhis
hands
.
<EOS>
“Joseph

”
<EOS>
said
Britton
,
reading
the
name
on
the
knife
.
<EOS>
“
Ha

Ha!Master
Gray

is
not
this
a

<EOS>
I

away

<EOS>
”“Nay
,
your
curiosity

be
amply
satisfied

continued
the
smith
,
approaching
his
mouth
closer
to
the
ear
of
him
who
we
shall
henceforthcall
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
It
was
a
week
before
I
—
even
I
,
savage
Britton
,
as
they
callme
,
ventured
to
unbar
that
door
,
and
when
I
did
<EOS>
it
was
at
midnight

<EOS>
”Gray
shook
with
emotion
and
groaned
deeply
.
<EOS>
“I
knew
the
spot
,
”
continued
Britton
,
and
he
lowered
his
voice
to
awhisper
,
while
deep
sighs
of
anguish
burst
from
the
labouring
breast
ofhis
listener
.
<EOS>
The
snow
pattered
against
the
windows
of
the
smithy
—
ahowling
wind
swept
round
the
ruined
pile
of
building
,
and
not
more
wildand
awful
was
the
winter
’s
storm
without
than
the
demoniac
passions
andfearful
excitement
of
those
two
men
of
blood
who
conversed
in
anxiouswhispers
in
the
Old
Smithy
,
until

CHAPTER
V.The
Morning.—A
Visit.—Blasted
Hopes.—The
<EOS>
Arranged
Meeting.—ThePacket.—And
the
Knife
.
<EOS>
The
snow
storm
had
ceased
,
and
a
clear
cold
winter
<EOS>
’s
sun
rose
uponLearmont
,
making
even
stern
winter
look
most
beautiful
.
<EOS>
The
snow
hungin
sparkling
masses
upon
every
tree
and
shrub
,
and
in
the
valley
wherethe
village
nestled
<EOS>
,
it
was
in
some
places
many
feet
in
depth
.
<EOS>
Thelittle
streamlet
which
ran
through
the
village
in
the
summer
time
,
witha
happy
murmuring
sound
,
was
now
still
and
voiceless
,
and
scarcely
tobe
distinguished
from
the
surrounding
land
.
<EOS>
Curling
masses
of
densesmoke
arose
from
the
chimneys
of
the
thatched
cottages
.
<EOS>
The
robin
sanghis
plaintive
ditty
on
the
window
sills
,
and
occasionally
might
be
seena
group
of
children
with
their
scanty
garments
repairing
to
the
frozenstream
to
gambol
on
its
slippery
surface
.
<EOS>
Far
above
every
other
habitation
in
the
place
,
towered
the
feudalresidence
of
the
Learmonts
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
ancient
residence
built
in
Gothicstyle
of
architecture
,
and
its
blackened
walls
and
time
-
worn
towerslooked
more
than
usually
stern
and
desolate
now
that
they
werecontrasted
with
the
pure
white
patches
of
snow
that
had
lodged
on
everyprojecting
stone
and
window
ledge
.
<EOS>
In
a
chamber
situated
nearly
in
the
very
centre
of
the
mansion
,
thewindows
of
which
were
provided
with
painted
blinds
,
representing
themost
beautiful
and
glowing
Arcadian
landscapes
,
and
the
temperature
ofwhich
was
raised
fully
to
that
of
summer
,
sat
the
same
tall
,
dark
-
browed
man
,
who
ten
years
before
had
visited
the
deserted
hovel
<EOS>
ofthe
Widow
Tatton
.
<EOS>
Time
had
not
swept
harmlessly
over
Squire
Learmont
.
<EOS>
His
raven
locks
were
largely
mixed
with
“
hoary
grey
.
”
<EOS>
The
deep
olive
ofhis
complexion
had
given
way
to
a
sickly
sallow
tint
,
which
waspeculiarly
disagreeable
to
look
upon
—
but
in
all
other
respects
the
manwas
the
same
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
same
contemptuous
curl
of
the
lip
—
the
sameangry
contraction
of
the
brow
,
and
the
same
ever
-
shifting
glance
andrestlessness
of
manner
which
betokened
a
heart
ill
at
ease
with
itself
.
<EOS>
An
open
letter
lay
before
him
which
he
occasionally
referred
to
,
as
ifto
guide
the
wandering
current
of
his
thoughts
,
and
after
perusingseveral
times
he
rose
from
his
seat
,
and
for
a
time
walked
backwardsand
for
in
the
room
in
silence
—
then
he
spoke
in
indistinct
and
mutteredsentences
.
<EOS>
“
Surely
,
”
he
muttered
,
“
I
may
at
last
venture
to
enjoy
whatI
have
plunged
so
deeply
to
obtain
.
<EOS>
What
a
vast
accumulation
of
wealthhave
<EOS>
I
not
now
in
my
grasp
,
and
shall
I
longer
hesitate
?
<EOS>
Have
I
not
nowthe
means
to
sit
down
by
royalty
and
outvie
its
grandeur
?
<EOS>
Ihave
—
ample
—
ample
.
<EOS>
Again
let
me
read
the
dear
assurance
of
unboundedwealth
.
<EOS>
Truly
,
this
money
scrivener
has
done
his
duty
with
the
largesums
I
have
entrusted
to
his
care
.
<EOS>
Let
me
see
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
stood
by
the
table
,
and
again
perused
the
letter
in
an
audible
voice
.
<EOS>
Noble
and
Honoured
Sir,—Agreeable
to
your
most
kind
instructions
<EOS>
I
sendan
account
of
the
disposal
of
all
the
moneys
from
time
to
timeentrusted
by
your
most
noble
worship
,
to
the
care
of
your
most
humbleservant
.
<EOS>
Your
honour
will
perceive
by
the
annexed
schedule
,
that
like
ariver
augmented
by
a
thousand
little
streams
,
you
honour
’s
realproperty
has
swollen
to
nearly
one
million
sterling
.
<EOS>
“A
million
,
”
cried
Learmont
,
drawing
himself
up
to
his
full
height
andcasting
a
flashing
glance
around
him
.
<EOS>
“
A
million
pieces
of
those
goldenslaves
that
are
ever
ready
to
yield
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
A
million
of
thoseglittering
sprites
which
are
more
powerful
than
the
genii
of
oldromance
.
<EOS>
Can
I
not
now
triumph
?
<EOS>
What
refinement
of
life
—
what
exquisiteenjoyments
can
now
be
denied
to
me!”The
door
now
softly
opened
,
and
an
old
servant
appeared
.
<EOS>
“What
now
?
”
cried
Learmont
abruptly
.
<EOS>
“Britton
,
the
smith
,
comes
for
your
worship
’s
orders
,
”
said
the
servant
.
<EOS>
A
gloom
spread
itself
over
the
countenance
of
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“Show
him
this
way
,
”
he
said
,
as
he
sank
into
a
chair
with
his
back
tothe
light
.
<EOS>
“He
brings
one
with
him
,
too
,
who
craves
to
see
your
worship
.
<EOS>
”“No
!
<EOS>
No
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Learmont
,
springing
to
his
feet
.
<EOS>
“
’
Tis
false
—
false
ashell
.
<EOS>
Has
he
dared
to
—
to
—
the
villain!—His
own
destruction
is
ascertain
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
domestic
looked
amazed
,
but
before
he
could
make
any
remark
,
Britton
the
smith
,
accompanied
by
Jacob
Gray
,
stood
on
the
threshold
ofthe
door
.
<EOS>
The
hand
of
Learmont
was
plunged
deep
beneath
the
breast
of
his
coat
,
as
he
said
.
<EOS>
“Well
?
<EOS>
What
—
who
is
that?”“A
friend
,
”
said
Britton
,
in
a
low
voice
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
Learmont
regarded
the
face
of
the
smith
with
attentiveearnestness
,
and
then
slowly
withdrawing
his
hand
,
which
had
doubtlessclasped
some
weapon
of
defence
,
he
said
to
the
servant
,
“
Leave
theroom
.
<EOS>
Well
,
Britton
;
I
<EOS>
—
I
am
glad
you
have
come
about
the
—
steelgauntlets
.
<EOS>
Leave
the
room
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
”The
servant
who
had
lingered
from
curiosity
,
reluctantly
left
andclosed
the
door
.
<EOS>
His
curiosity
,
however
,
was
far
from
satisfied
,
and
after
lingering
amoment
or
two
,
he
fairly
knelt
down
outside
the
door
and
placed
his
earas
flat
against
the
key
-
hole
as
it
was
possible
so
to
do
.
<EOS>
A
confusedmurmur
of
voices
was
all
that
by
his
utmost
exertions
he
could
hear
.
<EOS>
“A
plague
on
them
,
”
he
muttered
.
<EOS>
“
If
they
would
but
get
in
a
passionnow
and
speak
loud
.
”His
<EOS>
wish
was
gratified
,
for
at
the
moment
Learmont
’s
voice
rose
aboveits
ordinary
pitch
,
as
he
said
,
“
A
thousand
pounds
upon
the
assuranceof
the
fact
,
beyond
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
”The
reply
was
too
indistinct
to
hear
,
much
to
the
torture
of
theservants
and
in
another
moment
his
curiosity
received
a
disagreeablecheck
by
his
master
exclaiming
,
“
I
’ll
get
it
,
and
return
to
youimmediately
,
”
and
before
Oliver
,
which
was
the
old
domestic
’s
name
,
could
rise
from
his
knees
,
the
door
opened
,
and
his
master
nearly
fellover
him
on
the
threshold
.
<EOS>
“Ha
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Learmont
,
drawing
back
.
<EOS>
“
Fool
,
you
have
ensured
yourdestruction
.
”“Mercy
,
sir
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
mercy
!
”
cried
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
Learmont
took
a
sword
from
a
corner
of
the
room
and
unsheathed
it
.
<EOS>
“Hold
,
sir
,
a
moment
,
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
I
do
not
think
it
possible
he
couldhear
much
.
”“Dotard
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Learmont
,
to
the
trembling
Oliver
.
<EOS>
“
What
could
induceyou
to
throw
away
the
remnant
of
your
worthless
life
by
such
folly?”“Oh
,
sir
,
I
heard
nothing
—
I
know
nothing

”
cried
the
old
man
,
“
I
—
I
wasonly
passing
the
door
to

to
go
to

stooped

a

<EOS>
that
’s
all

upon

”“Where

”
said
the
smith
.
<EOS>
“Here

said
Oliver
,
pointing
to
the
oaken
floor
.
<EOS>
“
I
thought

but
found

fast

”“It
<EOS>
matters
not

said
Learmont
,
suddenly
casting
the
sword
from
him;“I
do
n’t

trifling

<EOS>

said
Oliver
;
“
<EOS>

on

I

”“Pooh,—pooh

<EOS>
cried
Learmont

<EOS>
“
I
forgive
thee
listening

<EOS>
Would
moneytempt

Oliver?”“To
<EOS>
what

sir
?
”
said
Oliver
,
with
such
a
look
of
real
innocence
,
thatLearmont
turned
aside
,
saying,—“Enough
—
he
knows
nothing
.
<EOS>
Begone!”With
precipitation
the
old
servant
left
the
apartment
,
and
when
he
wasfairly
gone
,
Learmont
turned
to
his
visitors
and
said,—“Rest
quiet
till
to

night
.
<EOS>
I
will
then
meet
you
at
the
smithy
.
<EOS>
”“That
may
scarcely
be
,
”
said
the
smith
,
“
for
this
gentleman
—
thisconsiderate
Master
Gray
,
must
get
hence
again
with
all
expedition

<EOS>
”“There
will
be

said
Gray
,
“
and
a

<EOS>
”“Be

it

so

said
the
smith

<EOS>
“To

Smithy

again
said
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“At
<EOS>
what
hour?”“After
midnight
.
<EOS>
I
will
tap
thrice
at

<EOS>
Reflect
upon

Gray

sum

<EOS>
”Gray
turned
his
small
cunning
eyes
upon
Learmont
as
he
replied,—“There
is
an
old
fable
,
of
the
Goose
and
the
Golden
Eggs

<EOS>
You

<EOS>
”“Nor

can
you
expect

to
comply
constantly
with
extortionate
demands,”replied
Learmont
,
trembling
with

“We
will
settle
all
to

said
the
smith

<EOS>
“
Do
not
fail
us

sir

”“Be
<EOS>
assured
I
will
not

But
recollect

I
come
to
purchase
the
silence

not
of
a
well
kept
secret
,
but
of
the
grave

<EOS>
”They
<EOS>
parted
,
and
once
again
the
Squire
of
Learmont
was
alone
with
hisown
thoughts
.
<EOS>
He
threw
himself
into
a
chair
,
with
a
deep
groan
,
saying,“There
must
be
more
blood

more
blood

VI.Night
<EOS>
Again.—The
Ruins.—The
Conference.—The
Old
Oaken
<EOS>
Door.—The
Resolve
.
<EOS>
Great
was
the
surprise
in
the
village
of
Learmont
at
the
non
-
appearanceof
the
stranger
who
had
arrived
during
the
snow
storm
at
the
village
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
seen
with
the
smith
proceeding
to
Learmont
House
,
but
thatone
should
willingly
take
up
even
a
day
residence
with
Savage
Britton
,
at
the
old
Smithy
,
was
quite
beyond
the
comprehension
of
the
simplevillagers
.
<EOS>
But
such
appeared
,
however
,
to
be
the
fact
,
for
every
one
was
<EOS>
confidentthe
stranger
had
not
left
Learmont
,
so
it
was
quite
clear
he
was
withthe
smith
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
terror
which
Britton
and
his
house
were
held
in
that
noneventured
to
go
sufficiently
near
it
to
ascertain
the
fact
,
and
the
daypassed
away
in
endless
conjectures
as
to
what
the
stranger
could
bypossibility
want
at
Learmont
,
first
,
with
the
smith
,
and
then
with
thesquire
.
<EOS>
Night
came
without
in
the
least
assuaging
the
generalcuriosity
,
or
adding
any
new
food
to
it
,
and
as
the
sun
sunk
in
the
farwest
,
and
the
cold
evening
wind
swept
moaning
and
sighing
among
theleafless
trees
,
the
heavy
clank
of
the
smith
’s
hammer
was
heard
asusual
at
intervals
till
near
midnight
.
<EOS>
Then
when
the
clock
in
the
high
tower
of
Learmont
struck
twelve
,
a
tallfigure
enveloped
in
an
ample
cloak
stalked
through
the
village
,
andtook
the
direct
route
to
the
Old
Smithy
.
<EOS>
The
night
had
set
in
very
dark
,
there
was
no
moonlight
,
for
masses
<EOS>
ofheavy
clouds
obscured
its
light
,
although
it
was
nearly
at
the
full
,
and
the
long
straggling
building
,
one
wing
of
which
was
inhabited
bythe
smith
,
showed
but
faintly
against
the
black
sky
.
<EOS>
The
Squire
of
Learmont
,
for
it
was
he
,
who
at
the
silent
hour
ofmidnight
,
had
stolen
out
to
keep
his
appointment
,
paused
when
hereached
the
wing
of
the
house
which
had
been
burnt
down
on
the
night
ofthe
storm
,
and
the
crumbling
ruins
of
which
remained
by
his
orders
justas
they
had
fallen
.
<EOS>
A
shudder
came
ever
his
frame
as
he
regarded
them
and
he
muttered
,
“
CanI
?
<EOS>
Dare
<EOS>
I
leave
this
spot
with
the
knowledge
of
what
it
conceals
?
<EOS>
Andyet
,
I
am
surely
safe
now
.
<EOS>
If
these
men
—
these
tools
by
which
I
havehewn
my
path
to
wealth
;
if
these
could
be
safely
disposed
of
—
then
—
ah
,
then
,
I
might
know
peace
.
<EOS>
At
least
this
anxious
fever
of
wildapprehension
that
gnaws
at
my
heart
would
subside
,
and
if
I
had
a
pangit
would
be
for
the
past
and
not
from
a
dread
of
that
which
was
tocome
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
folded
his
cloak
closer
around
him
,
and
with
hasty
steps
passedonwards
to
the
smithy
.
<EOS>
Thrice
he
struck
the
heavy
door
with
the
hilt
of
his
sword
,
and
in
amoment
the
smith
’s
voice
from
within
called
loudly
,
“
<EOS>
Who
knocks?”“Learmont
,
”
was
the
answer
;
the
door
was
flung
open
and
the
squirestood
as
the
stranger
had
stood
the
preceding
evening
in
the
glare
ofthe
fire
from
the
smithy
.
<EOS>
“You
are
punctual
,
sir
,
”
said
Gray
,
advancing
with
an
air
of
mockceremony
.
<EOS>
Learmont
waved
his
hand
in
reply
,
and
stalked
into
the
old
hall
.
<EOS>
“Now
,
”
he
said
,
when
Britton
had
barred
the
door
,
“
I
am
here
.
<EOS>
Make
yourproposition
.
<EOS>
”“Are
<EOS>
you
not
afraid
,
sir
,
”
sneered
Gray
,
“
to
trust
your
worshipfulperson
alone
with
two
such
old
acquaintances?”“No
,
”
answered
Learmont
fearlessly
,
“
I
know
you
both
too
well
.
<EOS>
Youcalculate
.
<EOS>
My
life
is
valuable
to
you
.
<EOS>
My
death
,
in
the
accomplishmentof
which
you
might
get
some
chance
injury
yourselves
,
would
be
aperfectly
gratuitous
act
.
”“Enough
<EOS>
of
this
folly
,
”
growled
Britton
.
<EOS>
“
Let
us
to
business
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
persevere
then
in
my
offer
,
”
said
Learmont
,
with
a
slight
tremblingof
his
voice
.
<EOS>
“
A
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
smith
was
silent
,
but
Gray
spoke
.
<EOS>
“We
have
decided
,
worshipful
sir
,
”
he
said
.
<EOS>
“And
your
decision
is—”“This
.
<EOS>
We
think
,
with
your
worship
,
that
London
is
the
most
delightfulof
cities
,
and
we
purpose
to
follow
you
thither
;
to
live
ever
near
you
,
and
to
trust
to
your
liberality
for
our
wants
.
<EOS>
”For
<EOS>
a
moment
it
seemed
,
by
the
convulsive
working
of
the
countenance
ofLearmont
,
that
he
was
about
to
burst
into
an
uncontrollable
fit
ofpassion
;
but
if
such
was
his
feeling
he
succeeded
in
suppressing
it
,
and
replied
with
an
affectation
of
calmness
,
“
Preposterous
!
<EOS>
You
mustthink
me
weak
,
indeed
,
to
be
thus
dictated
to
,
Master
Gray
.
<EOS>
”“Then
I
must
to
London
,
”
said
Gray
,
“
and
my
only
regret
is
that
I
havewasted
valuable
time
.
<EOS>
”“Look
<EOS>
ye
,
Squire
Learmont
<EOS>
,
”
said
Britton
,
folding
his
huge
arms
acrosshis
breast
,
and
glaring
with
his
ferocious
eyes
in
the
face
of
hispatron
.
<EOS>
“
I
was
to
have
been
well
paid
for
a
black
job
.
<EOS>
You
know
I
havebeen
<EOS>
ill
paid
,
on
the
plea
that
it
was
not
completed
.
<EOS>
”“I
have
constantly
supplied
your
wants
,
”
said
Learmont
,
shrinking
underthe
savage
gaze
of
the
smith
.
<EOS>
“I
have
not
starved
,
truly
,
”
continued
Britton
.
<EOS>
“
But
now
I
will
havewealth

”“Wealth

<EOS>
How
can
I
divide
sufficient
among
us
three
to
make
youwealthy?”“Master
Gray

continued
Britton
,
“
has
a

the
news

shall
enrich

<EOS>
”“If
<EOS>
I
absolutely

<EOS>
we
bargain
for
impunity
for
the
past

while
we—”“Denounce

<EOS>
”“And
to
what
extent

most
considerate
gentlemen
,
do
you
contemplatemaking
me

or
less
as
the
case
may
be

said
Gray
;
<EOS>
“
but
we
will
be
moderatein
a
gentlemanly
way
.
<EOS>
Eh
,
Britton?”“Certainly

”
growled
Britton
,
with
the
laugh
of
a
hyena
.
<EOS>
“The
sum
!
<EOS>
The
sum
!
”
said
,
Learmont
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
“Five
hundred
pounds
each
as
a
start
,
”
said
Jacob
Gray
,
with
the
mostunblushing
effrontery
.
<EOS>
“Enormous
!
”
cried
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“As
<EOS>
you
please

.
<EOS>
Our
conference
then
is
over

”“Britton
<EOS>
,
answer
me
one
question

”
said
the
squire
.
<EOS>
“A
dozen
,
if
you
please

”
replied
the
smith
.
<EOS>
“Have
<EOS>
you
been
through
that
doorway
,
<EOS>
since—”“I
have
,
Squire
Learmont
.
<EOS>
”“And
in
what
state—”“Can
you
venture
to
look
for
yourself
?
<EOS>
”
said
the
smith
,
with
a
sneer
.
<EOS>
Learmont
hesitated
,
and
then
said
,
“
I
can
.
<EOS>
Give
me
a
light
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
smith
lit
a
lamp
and
handed
it
to
the
squire
,
along
with
a
key
.
<EOS>
“Can
<EOS>
you
give
me
any
directions
?
”
said
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“Take
the
second
passage
to
your
right
and
look
closely
on
the
groundas
you
go
on
.
<EOS>
”Learmont
<EOS>
took
the
lamp
and
advanced
to
the
old
oaken
door
.
<EOS>
His
handtrembled
as
he
turned
the
rusty
lock
,
and
in
another
moment
he
hadpassed
through
,
and
was
lost
to
the
sight
of
the
confederates
in
thesmithy
.
<EOS>
In
less
than
two
minutes
,
he
returned
and
staggered
to
a
seat
.
<EOS>
“You
have
seen
it
?
”
said
Britton
.
<EOS>
“No

answered
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“
I
—
I
thought
I
had
the
nerve

for
my
life
Icould
not

three

place

”“Do

Thicken

<EOS>
For
several
minutes
neither
of
the
three
men
whose
crimes
had
broughtthem
into
such
strange
fellowship
,
spoke
.
<EOS>
They
regarded
each
with
themost
strange
and
mixed
emotions
.
<EOS>
Upon
the
face
of
the
haughty
Lord
ofLearmont
were
pride
,
hate
,
and
fear
,
each
struggling
for
mastery
.
<EOS>
Thesmith
looked
,
as
he
always
looked
,
brutally
ferocious
,
but
<EOS>
upon
thisoccasion
there
was
an
air
of
exultant
villany
upon
his
swarthy
visage
,
which
made
him
like
a
fiend
in
human
shape
.
<EOS>
Gray
,
the
cautious
andpolitic
villain
,
with
just
sufficient
relenting
in
his
cold
heart
tomake
him
stop
short
at
the
consummation
of
some
dark
deed
,
while
hewaded
recklessly
through
all
the
preliminary
proceedings
to
it
;
he
,
too
,
wore
a
triumphant
look
,
but
it
was
one
strangely
mingled
withsuspicion
and
doubt
,
whether
or
not
some
sudden
occurrence
would
damphis
joy
,
and
turn
his
self
-
congratulations
to
laments
.
<EOS>
He
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
.
<EOS>
“Had
we
not
now
better
separate
?
”
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
“
We
can
see
you
on

,
squire
.
”“There
<EOS>
is
yet
one
thing
which
remains
to
be
considered
,
”
said
Learmont
,
in
a
low
voice
.
<EOS>
“What
is
that
?
”
<EOS>
cried
the
smith
.
<EOS>
“When
we
are
all
gone
,
may
not
some
one
’s
curiosity
be
prompted
tovisit
<EOS>
this
house?”“That
is
true
,
”
said
Gray
,
turning
pale
.
<EOS>
“If
<EOS>
they
do
,
”
cried
Britton
,
“
they
shall
find
nothing
;
I
will
see
tothat
.
<EOS>
”“Let
<EOS>
it
be
so
,
then
,
”
said
Learmont
,
rising
.
<EOS>
“Before
we
separate
now
,
”
interposed
Gray
,
“
there
is
one
thing
which
weshould
all
feel
thoroughly
assured
,
and
that
is
,
that
our
mutual

our
mutual
preservation

<EOS>
”“We

most

sneered
Learmont
,
as
heclasped
his
cloak
,
preparatory
to
leaving
the
smithy

<EOS>
“Perhaps
,
not
fully

”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“I
am
sure
,
not

cried
Britton
,
with
a
hoarse
laugh
.
<EOS>
“
I
have
ahold
upon
our
good
friend

I

”“Ha

Learmont
,
turning
ghastly
pale

<EOS>
“
What

way

said
the
smith
,
beckoning
the
squire
to
the
further
end
ofthe
apartment

<EOS>
Learmont
obeyed
the
invitation
,
and
whatever
was
thecommunication
he
received
,
it
was
conveyed
very
briefly
,
for
hesuddenly
exclaimed—“Enough

<EOS>
and
strode
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
“Your
worshipful
squireship

said
Gray
,
“
will
always
please
torecollect

<EOS>
”“Hear
<EOS>

<EOS>
cried
Learmont
,
turning
with
flashing
eyes
uponthe
two
men
who
so
mocked
him
with
their
power
.
<EOS>
“
I
know;—I
admit
thatyou

my
destruction

<EOS>
We
do
understand
one
another

and
we
may
as
well
speak
openly

<EOS>
What
you
would
say
is
this
,
Jacob
Gray

that
I
dare
not
for
my
ownsafety
take
your
vile
life
;
and
you
the
same
,
Britton
<EOS>
;
you
have
me
inyour
toils
,
I
grant
it
;
there
needs
no
insinuations

<EOS>
We
have
wadedthrough
too
much
blood
to
feel
any
delicacy
of
speech
towards
eachother

<EOS>
You
have
power

but
beware
how
you
use
it

or
you
will
rouse
adevil
that
you

again

<EOS>
Be
moderate

<EOS>
Drive
me
too
far

you
perish

saying
,
without
waiting
for
an
answer
,
he
strode
from
the
smithywith
his
face
distorted
by
passion
,
leaving
the
two
confederates
,
whohad
not
expected
such
a
burst
of
fury
,
abashed
,
even
in
spite
of
theirdeep
villanies

abounding
craft

<EOS>
“Gray

said
the
smith
,
after
a
few
moments

silence

<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
started
and
cried
,
“
What
shall

If

turned
ghastly
pale

he
said

<EOS>
took
a

lighting
it
by

he
held

upon

he
pointed

torch
in

hand

so
as
to
throw
a
red
glare
of
light
overthe
vast
apartment

the
smith
clutched
with
the
other
the
tremblingcompanion

dragged
him
with
irresistible
force

oaken

<EOS>
In

And
now
they
reached

door

he
clung
to
the
damp
wall

screamed

the

heeded

with
shouts

Theglare

with

Gray
fell
insensible
to

shaken

the

with
a
cry

Plot

<EOS>
Who
or
what
the
form
was
that
so
unexpectedly
met
the
terrified
gaze
ofthe
savage
smith
,
and
his
more
nervous
and
timid
companion
in
the
OldSmithy
,
we
must
leave
to
be
discovered
in
the
progress
of
our
eventfuland
strange
narrative
.
<EOS>
By
the
first
gray
tint
of
morning
light
,
there
sat
three
persons
in
asmall
room
of
the
mansion
of
Learmont
;
they
were
the
smith
,
Gray
,
andthe
squire
himself
.
<EOS>
A
quantity
of
money
lay
upon
the
table
before
them
,
upon
which
Gray
’s
eyes
were
fixed
with
eager
expression
.
<EOS>
The
smith
wasevidently
not
indifferent
to
the
sparkling
treasure
before
him
,
but
hedid
not
exhibit
his
feelings
so
openly
as
Jacob
Gray
,
while
the
Lord
ofLearmont
himself
sat
with
his
back
to
the
dim
light
in
moody
silence
.
<EOS>
“I
shall
be
off
,
”
cried
Gray
,
“
before
another
cock
can
proclaim
the
dayis
coming
.
<EOS>
”Learmont
<EOS>
merely
inclined
his
head
.
<EOS>
“And
I

”
said
Britton
,
“
leave
here
for
London
in
the
course
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
”“Once
<EOS>
more
,
”
said
Learmont
,
in
a
deep
hollow
voice—“once
more
<EOS>
I
offeryou
the
large
sum
I
have
mentioned
,
if
you
will
accede
to
my
twopropositions
.
<EOS>
”“No
<EOS>
sir
,
”
replied
Gray
,
“
I
say
no
.
<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
you
,
Britton?”“I
say
no
,
likewise
,
”
replied
the
smith
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
double
my
offer
,
”
cried
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“Double
?
”
echoed
Gray
.
<EOS>
“Aye
,
double
.
<EOS>
Let
me
but
be
sure
that
he
is
no
more
,
and
upon
yourarrival
in
any
part
of
America
you
may
choose
,
you
will
find
an
orderthere
for
the
amount
.
<EOS>
”“No

<EOS>
No

”
<EOS>
cried
Britton
.
<EOS>
“’Tis
<EOS>
a
large
sum
,
a
very
large
sum
,
”
murmured
Gray
.
<EOS>
“Hark
ye
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Learmont
,
his
face
glowing
with
excitement
.
<EOS>
“
Hark
ye!your
presence
will
be
my
curse
.
<EOS>
Every
time
I
see
you
will
blast
my
eyeswith
the
remembrance
of
what
I
intend
to
forget
in
the
vortex
ofpleasure

<EOS>
My
double
offer
amounts
to
no
less
a
sum
than
two
thousandpounds

each
of
you

<EOS>
Once
more

I
raise
your

Britton

<EOS>
“
A

<EOS>
No

Learmont

there
is
nothing
like

<EOS>
”“Very

said
Gray

<EOS>
“
That

exceedingly

rose
from
his
chair
without
saying
a
word
,
but
his
very
lips
werepale
with
suppressed
rage
.
<EOS>
He
hastily
collected
the
money
that
laybefore
him
,
and
having
bestowed
it
away
in
safety
,
he
cast
a
malignantscowl
upon
Learmont
,
and
said,—“We
shall
meet
again
soon

sir

when

should
you
happen

Now

<EOS>
Sosaying
,
without
waiting
for
a
reply
,
he
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
The
dark
eyes
of
the
Squire
of
Learmont
flashed
with
rage
,
as
Gray
gaveutterance
to
this
taunt
,
and
when
the
last
echo
of
his
retreatingfootsteps
had
died
away
,
Britton
broke
the
silence
that
ensued
,
bysaying,—“Yon
knave
knows
his
power

<EOS>
”“Aye
,
does
he

<EOS>
cried
Learmont
,
striking
the
table
with
his
clenchedhand

<EOS>
“
But
we
,
Britton
,
are
not
altogether
powerless

<EOS>
”“What
<EOS>
can
we
do
?
”
said
the
smith
.
<EOS>
“Jacob
Gray
and
his
secret
must
perish
together

<EOS>
”“With
<EOS>
all
my
heart
,

but
the
fellow
’s
caution
is
so
excessive

that
we
are
more
interested
in
his
preservation
than
his
destruction

<EOS>
”“True
,
”
replied
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“
His
caution
is
great
,
as
you
say
,
but
thereare
times
when
the
most
cautious
are
off

guard

<EOS>
Remember
this
,
Britton
,
that
every
guinea
that
finds
its
way
into
the
purse
of
JacobGray

is
a
guinea
torn
from

<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
know
it

cried
the
smith
,
“
and
I
would
have
scattered
his
brainsupon
<EOS>
the
hearth

stone
of

Old

that

averred

hadtaken
the
precaution

leaving

written
statement
of
all
he
knew
athome
,
to
be
opened
if
he
returned
not
within
a

time

and
althoughI
doubted
that
he
had
done
so
,
even
to
the
verge

positive

yet
was
the

too

I
let

”“For

Learmont

A
grim
smile
crossed
the
face
of
Britton

he
said;“Should

suddenly

’”A
<EOS>
dark
scowl
passed
over
the
face
of
Learmont
;
but
before
he
couldobject
to
the
pass
-
words
which
the
brutal
smith
had
adopted
,
he
hadleft
the
room
,
and
the
wealthy
but
ill
-
at
-
ease
owner
of
<EOS>
Learmont
andits
<EOS>
huge
possessions
was
left
to
the
communion
of
his
own
broodingthoughts
.
<EOS>
For
a
time
he
sat
in
silence
,
with
his
head
resting
upon
his
hand
.
<EOS>
Thenhe
rose
and
paced
the
apartment
with
unequal
strides
,
muttering
tohimself
in
disjointed
sentences
.
<EOS>
“Yes
—
yes
,
”
he
said
,
“
this
is
politic
—
most
politic

<EOS>
If
Britton
can
be
sofar
wrought
upon
by
his
love
of
gold
as
to
destroy
this
Jacob

his

Good

I

You
shall
have
your

<EOS>
You
shall
assure

past

a

<EOS>
Tis
well
—
exceedingly
well

<EOS>
These

destroy
each

in
this
way
—
Britton
destroys
Gray
—
and
I
destroyBritton

all
will
be

<EOS>
That
child
will
then
be
innoxious

<EOS>
No
onecan
know
who
it
is

it
will
be
a
child
of
mystery

if
I

my
praises

<EOS>
What
a
glorious
revenge
!
<EOS>
Let
me
consider
—
thosepapers
which
Britton
says
he
has
,
and
which
he
likewise
asserts

—
what?—Illegitimate
?
<EOS>
I
know
I
am
illegitimate
,
but
is
there
proof
,
and
has
he
such
proof
?
<EOS>
Let
me
recollect
what
he
said
—
that
Gray
hadtaught
him
more
craft
,
and
he
took
care
of
the
papers
he
had
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
thatwas
it

<EOS>
Shall
I
employ
Gray
to
do
by
Britton
even
as
I
have
urgedBritton
to
do
by
Gray
?
<EOS>
I
will
—
<EOS>
I
will
—
it
is
a
master

stroke

<EOS>
I
cannotwell
deal
with
the
two

whichever
succeeds

,
at

rid

CHAPTER
IX.London
in
1742.—Gray

’s
<EOS>
Home.—The
<EOS>
Child.—The
Voice
of
Conscience.—AVisit
.
<EOS>
The
course
of
our
narrative
compels
us
now
to
leave
the
little
villageof
Learmont
and
all
its
mysteries
to
direct
the
reader
’s
attention
tothe
great
metropolis
,
not
as
it
is
now
,
crowded
with
costly
buildings
,
and
its
shops
vying
with
palaces
in
splendour
,
but
as
it
was
a
hundredyears
since
,
before
Regent
-
street
was
thought
of
,
and
when
we
werestill
enjoying
that
piece
of
wisdom
of
our
dear
ancestors
which
inducedthem
to
make
every
street
as
narrow
as
possible
,
every
house
as
dark
aspossible
,
and
everything
as
inconvenient
as
possible
.
<EOS>
In
a
long
narrow
street
,
which
began
somewhere
about
where
the
CountyFire
Office
now
stands
,
and
terminated
Heaven
knows
where
,
inasmuch
asit
branched
off
into
a
thousand
intricacies
of
lanes
,
courts
,
andalleys
,
there
stood
one
house
in
particular
,
to
which
we
wish
to
callattention
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
narrow
,
gloomy
-
looking
habitation
,
and
stood
wedgedin
between
two
shops
of
very
questionable
character
.
<EOS>
The
person
who
rented
this
house
was
a
Mistress
Bridget
Strangeways
,
and
she
did
not
belie
her
name
,
for
her
ways
were
strange
indeed
.
<EOS>
Thislady
(
from
courtesy
)
professed
to
be
a
widow
<EOS>
and
she
gained
a
verycomfortable
subsistence
by
letting
to
anybody
and
everybody
the
variousfurnished
apartments
in
her
house
.
<EOS>
With
the
curious
collection
oflodgers
which
Mrs.
Strangeways
had
in
her
house
on
the
occasion
towhich
we
refer
—
namely
,
the
winter
of
1742—we
have
little
or
nothing
todo
.
<EOS>
The
only
one
of
her
lodgers
to
whom
we
shall
at
present
introducethe
reader
,
was
sitting
alone
in
a
back
room
boasting
but
of
fewcomforts
,
and
the
walls
of
which
were
of
a
deep
brown
colour
from
age
.
<EOS>
Still
,
if
the
furniture
and
appointments
of
the
room
were
few
,
mean
,
and
scanty
,
everything
was
arranged
with
great
neatness
and
order
.
<EOS>
Thehearth
was
cleanly
swept
,
the
little
fire
that
blazed
in
the
smallgrate
was
carefully
tended
,
the
windows
were
scrupulously
clean
,
and
itwas
clear
that
the
most
had
been
made
of
the
scanty
means
of
comfortwhich
the
place
afforded
.
<EOS>
Seated
in
a
high
-
backed
,
ancient
-
looking
chair
,
was
a
boy
reading
.
<EOS>
Hisface
was
inclined
towards
his
book
,
and
a
mass
of
raven
curls
,
which
heheld
from
covering
his
face
with
his
hand
,
fell
,
however
,
sufficientlyover
his
countenance
to
hide
it
from
observation
.
<EOS>
His
figure
was
slightin
<EOS>
the
extreme
,
and
the
long
tapered
fingers
which
held
back
thetresses
of
his
hair
,
were
exquisitely
white
and
delicate
.
<EOS>
The
dress
<EOS>
ofthe
period
was
ill
-
suited
to
set
off
the
figure
to
advantage
,
but
stillcumbrous
and
ungraceful
,
as
was
the
long
-
flapped
waistcoat
,
broad
-
skirted
coat
,
and
heavy
shoe
-
buckles
,
no
one
could
look
for
amoment
upon
that
young
boy
without
confessing
him
to
be
eminentlyhandsome
.
<EOS>
He
was
most
intently
engaged
upon
his
book
,
and
he
moved
neither
handnor
foot
for
many
minutes
,
<EOS>
so
absorbed
was
he
in
the
narrative
he
wasreading
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
however
,
he
lifted
his
head
,
and
shaking
back
<EOS>
fromhis
brow
the
clustering
hair
<EOS>
,
he
cried
in
a
voice
of
enthusiasm,—“Oh
,
what
a
dear
romance
!
<EOS>
How
these
treasures
of
books
cheat
the
hoursof
their
weariness
.
<EOS>
”As
<EOS>
he
spoke
he
turned
his
head
to
the
window
.
<EOS>
What
a
world
ofintelligence
and
gentle
beauty
was
in
that
face
!
<EOS>
It
was
a
face
to
gazeat
for
hours
and
speculate
upon
.
<EOS>
“Five
days
my
uncle
has
been
gone
now
,
”
he
said—“five
whole
days
,
andwhat
should
I
have
done
without
these
dear
books
?
<EOS>
How
kind
of
AlbertSeyton
to
lend
them
to
me
!
<EOS>
I
do
love
Albert
Seyton
,
and
if
—
if
—
no
—
no
,
Imust
not
breathe
that
even
to
myself
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Heavens
!
<EOS>
That
I
should
be
sounfortunate
.
<EOS>
When
—
<EOS>
oh
,
when
will
my
uncle
,
who
is
so
stern
,
and
yettender
—
so
cruel
,
and
yet
sometimes
so
kind
<EOS>
—
when
will
he
explain
to
methe
awful
mystery
he
hints
at
when
with
tears
I
urge
him
to
let
me—”A
low
knock
at
the
room
door
now
attracted
his
attention
,
and
<EOS>
the
boycried
cheerfully,—“Ha
!
<EOS>
I
know
that
tap
,
’
Tis
Albert
.
<EOS>
Come
in
—
come
in
,
<EOS>
Albert
,
I
am
here
,
and
all
alone
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
door
was
immediately
opened
,
and
a
boy
of
about
fourteen
or
fifteenyears
of
age
,
whose
long
flaxen
hair
and
ruddy
complexion
proclaimedhim
to
be
of
true
Saxon
origin
,
bounded
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
“Your
uncle
still
absent
,
Harry
?
”
<EOS>
he
cried
.
<EOS>
“Yes
,
”
replied
the
lad
who
had
been
reading
.
<EOS>
“
Five
days
now
,
Albert
,
hehas
been
gone
.
<EOS>
What
should
I
have
done
without
you?”“You
know
<EOS>
I
love
you
,
Harry
Gray
,
”
said
Seyton
.
<EOS>
“
You
are
very
young
,
but
you
are
a
great
deal
more
sensible
than
many
lads
of
twice
yourage
.
<EOS>
”“I’m
<EOS>
past
eleven
!
”
said
he
who
was
called
Harry
Gray
.
<EOS>
“That
’s
a
great
age
,
”
said
the
other
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
“
If
you
do
n’t
thinkyour
uncle
would
pop
in
unawares
,
I
would
sit
with
you
an
hour
.
<EOS>
My
poorfather
is
out
again
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
Harry
,
he
still
hopes
to
procure
a
recompensefrom
the
count
.
<EOS>
He
lost
his
all
in
the
cause
of
the
present
royalfamily
,
and
now
you
see
they
have
left
him
and
myself
to
starve
.
<EOS>
It’stoo
bad!”“It
’s
wicked
,
”
said
Harry
Gray
.
<EOS>
“So
<EOS>
it
is
,
”
replied
Albert
.
<EOS>
“
But
we
wo
n’t
talk
about
it
any
more
now
.
<EOS>
”The
lad
who
was
the
occupant
of
the
apartment
was
silent
for
a
fewmoments
,
then
he
said
sadly,—“Five
days
gone
—
five
days
.
<EOS>
Albert
,
I
think
I
will
tell
you
a
secret
.
<EOS>
”“A
<EOS>
secret
,
Harry?”“Yes
;
it
is
a
very
strange
one
,
and
has
made
me
very
unhappy
.
<EOS>
Comehere
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
took
the
hand
of
his
companion
and
led
him
to
a
corner
of
the
roomwhere
there
was
a
large
,
old
-
fashioned
oaken
chest
,
and
taking
from
hisbreast
a
key
,
he
opened
it
,
and
lifting
the
lid
,
disclosed
lying
at
thebottom
of
it
a
roll
of
paper
,
and
under
that
a
large
sealed
packet
.
<EOS>
Harry
Gray
lifted
out
the
roll
of
paper
and
handed
it
to
Albert
,
saying
,
“
Read
what
is
written
there
,
”
pointing
to
a
few
lines
on
thewrapper
.
<EOS>
Albert
read
with
surprise
the
following
words:—Wednesday.—Harry,—If
I
am
not
with
you
by
twelve
of
the
clock
on
nextWednesday
,
take
this
roll
of
papers
to
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
who
livesin

cage
.
<EOS>
Walk
by
the
Park
.
<EOS>
Do
not
let

hand
but
his

it
from
you
.
<EOS>
J.G.“That
<EOS>
’s
very
odd
,
”
said
Albert
.
<EOS>
“
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
is
a
great
man
.
<EOS>
The
king
knighted
him
lately
,
I
heard
,
and
he
is
a
magistrate
.
<EOS>
This
isquite
a
mystery
,
my
dear
Harry
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
you
are
some
prince
,
really
.
”Harry
looked
up
with
a
beaming
smile
in
the
face
of
his
young
friend
,
as
he
said,—“Be
<EOS>
I
who
or
what
<EOS>
I
may
,
I
shall
never
forget
Albert
Seyton

”“You

cried
Albert
,
throwing
his
armaffectionately
round
his
young
friend

neck
,
“

I
will
get

<EOS>
”“That

be

said
Harry
,
clasping
his
hands—“oh
,
such
joy!”“You
are
a
little
delicate
thing

continued
Albert
,
“

door
was
at
this
moment
suddenly
flung
open
,
and
,
livid
with
rage
,
Jacob
Gray
stood
on
the
threshold
.
<EOS>
Harry
gave
a
faint
cry
of
alarm
,
and
Albert
started
to
his
feet
fromkneeling
by
the
box
,
and
boldly
confronted
Gray
.
<EOS>
“So
,
”
cried
Gray
,
striding
into
the
room
,
and
shutting
the
doorviolently
behind
him—“so
,
it
is
thus
I
find
you
engaged!”“Sir

said
Albert
Seyton
,
“
if
you
have
any
fault
to
find

find
it
withme

not

done
wrong

it
was
my

what

suppose
I
must
fight
you

added
Albert
.
<EOS>
“Brat

<EOS>
shrieked
Gray
,
rushing
towards
the
box
.
<EOS>
“
Whathave
you
seen
—
what
have
you
done?”“Seen
very
little
,
and
done
nothing

said
Albert
.
<EOS>
Gray
aimed
a
blow
at
Harry
,
which
was
warded
by
Albert
,
who
cried,—“For
shame

for
shame
to
strike
him

By

!

Mr.

go

box
here

”Jacob
<EOS>
Gray
stood
with
his
aim
uplifted
,
as
if
paralysed
at
this
threat
.
<EOS>
He
trembled
violently
,
and
sank
into
a
chair
.
<EOS>
Several
times
he
tried
tospeak
,
and
at
length
he
said
,
with
a
forced
smile
,
which
sat
hideouslyupon
his
distorted
features,—“Well
—
<EOS>
well

it
’s
not

Never

It

”“Then

said
Seyton

“Yes

raised
his

,

CHAPTER
X.The
<EOS>
Disappearance.—Mrs
.
<EOS>
Bridget
Strangeways
and
the
Old
OakenChest.—Albert
’s
Grief
and
Despair
.
<EOS>
There
were
cries
of
pain
and
deep
sobs
heard
proceeding
from
the
roomoccupied
by
Jacob
Gray
long
after
Albert
Seyton
had
left
them
.
<EOS>
None
ofthe
inhabitants
of
the
house
thought
it
necessary
to
interfere
,
although
it
was
shrewdly
suspected
that
Master
Gray
was
not
very
kindto
<EOS>
his
poor
,
delicate
little
nephew
.
<EOS>
It
’s
a
true
adage
that
what
is
everybody
’s
business
turns
out
to
benobody
<EOS>
’s
.
<EOS>
Surely
it
was
everybody
’s
business
to
interfere
and
preventill
-
usage
in
any
shape
,
and
yet
no
one
did
interfere
;
and
Albert
Seytonhad
left
home
in
search
of
his
father
,
so
that
poor
Harry
Gray
had
nofriend
.
<EOS>
The
night
set
in
cold
and
dreary
,
and
before
the
evening
had
faradvanced
,
Jacob
Gray
left
the
house
,
locking
Harry
in
while
he
wasgone
,
and
presently
returned
with
several
bottles
of
wine
under
hisarm
.
<EOS>
The
neighbours
then
heard
him
alternately
cursing
,
laughing
,
shouting
,
and
singing
till
past
midnight
;
then
all
became
suddenlystill
,
and
those
who
had
been
kept
awake
by
his
voice
went
comfortablyto
sleep
,
while
Mrs.
Bridget
Strangeways
made
a
mental
determinationand
a
strong
vow
that
the
next
morning
she
would
give
Mr.
Jacob
Graynotice
to
quit
forthwith
and
at
the
same
time
take
the
opportunity
oftelling
him
“
a
piece
of
her
mind
,
”
that
she
would
.
<EOS>
Now
Mrs.
Strangeways
enjoyed
nothing
better
than
telling
people
<EOS>
“
piecesof
her
mind
,
”
and
,
by
some
strange
fatality
,
such
mental
extracts
werenever
of
a
complimentary
character
,
and
whatever
charms
the
mind
ofMrs
.
<EOS>
Strangeways
might
possess
as
a
whole
,
it
was
quite
well
knownthat
,
given
forth
in
“
pieces
”
<EOS>
each
piece
was
enough
to
set
a
city
bythe
ears
,
and
would
have
most
surely
come
under
the
cognizance
of
thatclause
in
the
New
Police
Act
,
so
Mrs.
Strangeways
made
up
her
mind
verycomposedly
and
comfortably
to
give
Mr.
Jacob
Gray
such
a
“
hearing
”
ashe
never
had
in
his
life
,
and
never
would
have
again
,
except
heprovoked
Mrs.
Strangeways
on
some
future
occasion
to
an
equal
pitch
ofwrath
.
<EOS>
The
morning
came
,
and
Mrs.
Bridget
Strangeways
having
communicated
herintentions
with
respect
to
Mr.
Jacob
Gray
to
a
select
few
of
herlodgers
and
neighbours
,
fortified
herself
with
a
tolerable
dose
of“cordial
,
”
and
setting
her
arms
a
-
kimbo
,
she
walked
majestically
up
tothe
room
of
her
troublesome
lodger
.
<EOS>
She
knocked
and
knocked
,
andknocked
again
;
but
Jacob
Gray
was
obstinate
,
and
would
not
say
“
comein
;
”
so
at
length
Mrs.
Strangeways
opened
the
door
with
a
rush
,
andentered
the
room
,
<EOS>
exclaiming,—“Muster
Gray
,
I
’d
have
you
to
know
,
<EOS>
Muster
Gray
,
as
this
house
is—”The
lady
had
got
so
far
when
she
saw
that
there
was
no
Muster
Gray
,
tohear
the
piece
of
her
mind
,
and
her
eyes
dilated
as
she
glanced
roundthe
room
and
saw
nothing
but
vacancy
.
<EOS>
On
the
table
lay
a
little
piece
of
paper
,
and
on
the
little
piece
ofpaper
lay
some
money
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Strangeways
clutched
at
both
,
and
,
as
sheafterwards
declared
,
“
you
might
have
knocked
her
down
with
a
smallfeather
”
when
she
read,—Mrs
.
<EOS>
Strangeways

.
<EOS>
Her
lodger
,
Jacob
Gray
,
is
going
to
the
otherend
of
the
world
,
and
he
has
taken
his
nephew
with
him
.
<EOS>
The
lady
gave
a
great
shriek
(
after
pocketing
the
money
)
,
which
rousedthe
house
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
room
was
full
of
company
,
amongwhom
was
Albert
Seyton
,
with
apprehension
in
his
looks
.
<EOS>
“Good
Heavens
!
”
<EOS>
he
cried
,
“
is
anything
the
matter
with
Harry?”“What
is
it
—
<EOS>
what
is
it
?
”
<EOS>
cried
a
dozen
voices
at
once
.
<EOS>
“Oh
,
that
villain
,
Jacob
Gray
!
”
<EOS>
gasped
Mrs.
Strangeways
.
<EOS>
“Where
is
he
?
”
<EOS>
cried
everybody
.
<EOS>
“At
<EOS>
the
other
end
of
the
world
,
”
replied
Mrs.
Strangeways
.
<EOS>
“Harry
!
<EOS>
Harry!—where
are
you
?
”
<EOS>
shouted
Albert
,
at
once
rushing
into
thelittle
closet
which
had
been
the
sleeping
-
chamber
of
the
delicate
andsensitive
boy
.
<EOS>
All
was
still
and
empty
.
<EOS>
Harry
’s
<EOS>
little
bed
hadevidently
never
been
slept
in
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
’s
was
in
the
same
state
.
<EOS>
Every
little
article
that
had
belonged
to
them
was
removed
.
<EOS>
There
wasnothing
in
the
rooms
<EOS>
but
what
was
the
lawful
property
of
Mrs
.
Strangeways
,
except
the
old
oaken
chest
.
<EOS>
“That
chest
,
”
said
Albert—”he
has
left
that
.
<EOS>
”“It
<EOS>
’s
mine
,
”
cried
Mrs.
Strangeways
.
<EOS>
“
The
villain
has
run
away
,
as
youall
see
,
and
cheated
a
lone
and
defenceless
,
delicate
female
out
of
herlawful
rent
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
the
wretch!”Albert
Seyton
sprang
to
the
box
.
<EOS>
It
was
locked
.
<EOS>
“I
think
we
ought
to
see
what
’s
in
here
,
”
he
cried
.
<EOS>
“Do
you
,
Jackanapes
?
”
screamed
Mrs.
Strangeways
,
who
by
no
meanswished
,
should
there
be
anything
worth
having
in
the
chest
,
to
letevery
one
<EOS>
know
it
.
<EOS>
“
I
’d
have
you
to
know
,
<EOS>
Master
Albert
Seyton
,
as
it’sno
business
of
yours
.
”“It
<EOS>
’s
locked
,
”
cried
Albert
;
“
but
the
poker
,
I
dare
say
,
will
open
it
.
”“Do
<EOS>
you
dare
say
the
poker
will
open
it
!
”
<EOS>
screamed
Mrs.
Strangeways
.
<EOS>
“Let
<EOS>
anybody
touch
it
if
they
dare
.
”So
<EOS>
saying
the
lady
,
to
make
sure
of
her
real
or
fancied
prize
,
rushedforward
and
sat
herself
down
on
the
old
,
chest
with
such
a
thump
,
thatthe
crazy
lid
gave
way
,
and
with
a
shriek
Mrs.
Strangeways
fell
in
asingular
position
into
it
.
<EOS>
When
she
was
hauled
out
by
the
united
exertions
of
everybody
,
it
wassatisfactorily
discovered
that
the
chest
was
empty
.
<EOS>
Albert
Seyton
sawat
a
glance
that
it
was
so
,
and
he
immediately
left
the
deserted
roomsin
grief
for
the
loss
of
his
young
friend
Harry
,
to
whom
he
felt
warmlyattached
.
<EOS>
He
went
to
his
father
’s
apartments
,
and
throwing
himself
intoa
chair
,
he
burst
into
tears
,
exclaiming—“My
poor
Harry
<EOS>
,
I
shall
never
see
you
again!”Albert
Seyton
<EOS>
’s
father
had
been
a
gentleman
of
considerable
property
,
but
he
had
lost
all
by
his
adherence
to
the
royal
family
,
who
,
now
atthe
end
,
as
they
thought
,
of
a
civil
war
,
were
seated
on
the
throne
ofEngland
.
<EOS>
In
vain
he
had
sought
compensation
.
<EOS>
A
scanty
pension
justsufficient
to
keep
him
and
his
only
boy
Albert
from
actual
want
,
wasall
<EOS>
he
could
wring
from
the
government
,
and
now
,
day
after
day
,
hehaunted
the
court
with
the
hope
of
calling
attention
at
some
fortunatemoment
to
his
just
claims
.
<EOS>
He
was
out
when
all
this
conversation
took
place
in
the
house
,
wherecircumstances
had
compelled
him
to
take
up
his
humble
home
.
<EOS>
While
Albert
was
still
suffering
from
the
first
real
gush
of
heartfeltsorrow
which
had
dimmed
the
brightness
of
his
early
youth
,
his
fatherreturned
home
,
and
seeing
his
son
in
tears
,
was
at
once
alarmed
andafflicted
,
nor
could
he
be
convinced
that
something
had
not
happeneduntil
<EOS>
Albert
had
related
to
him
the
history
of
the
oaken
chest
and
whatit
had
contained
.
<EOS>
This
,
coupled
with
the
sudden
and
mysteriousdisappearance
of
Jacob
Gray
,
led
Mr.
Seyton
to
think
that
there
was
agreat
deal
more
in
the
matter
than
met
the
eye
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
he
had
another
reason
which
he
did
not
disclose
to
Albert
,
but
which
the
reader
will
know
in
its
right
place
,
for
suspecting
thata
great
mystery
was
connected
in
some
way
with
Jacob
Gray
and
his
youngnephew
.
<EOS>
Full
of
these
thoughts
,
Mr.
Seyton
debated
with
himself
<EOS>
whetherit
was
his
duty
to
inform
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
of
all
thecircumstances
;
but
then
when
he
came
to
consider
how
bald
anddisjointed
a
narrative
he
had
to
tell
,
and
how
he
must
terminate
it
bysaying
that
he
had
no
clue
whatever
to
the
whereabouts
of
the
partieswho
he
suspected
of
<EOS>
he
knew
not
what
,
he
gave
up
,
the
idea
aspremature
,
and
turning
to
his
son
<EOS>
,
he
said,—“Albert
,
did
young
Harry
Gray
ever
confide
to
you
any
particulars
ofhis
early
life?”“Never
,
father
,
”
said
Albert
.
<EOS>
“
He
always
told
me
he
was
the
child
ofmystery
,
and
that
his
life
was
a
romance
.
<EOS>
Then
he
would
sigh
and
weep
,
and
hope
that
the
day
would
come
when
he
could
confide
all
to
me
.
<EOS>
So
,
sir
,
I
could
not
press
him
.
”“Press
<EOS>
him!—certainly
not
.
<EOS>
To
have
wormed
his
secret
from
himunwillingly
would
have
been
unjustifiable
in
the
extreme
.
<EOS>
In
truth
,
hewas
a
gentle
boy
.
”“Oh
,
father
,
I
loved
him
,
dearly
loved
him
.
”Mr
.
<EOS>
Seyton
was
silent
for
some
moments
,
then
beckoning
his
son
to
him
,
he
whispered
a
few
words
in
his
ear
,
which
brought
the
eloquent
bloodin
a
full
rush
to
the
cheeks
of
Albert
,
and
he
gasped
rather
than
said,“Indeed
,
no
father
;
<EOS>
I
—
I
—
never
thought—”“Then
never
mention
what
I
have
suggested
,
just
now
,
”
said
Mr.
Seyton,“till
I
give
you
leave
,
and
Albert
,
depend
upon
my
using
my
utmostexertions
to
endeavour
to
discover
the
mystery
which
envelopes
the
fateof
your
young
friend
.
<EOS>
”Albert
listened
to
his
father
with
rapt
attention
,
when
he
threwhimself
into
his
arms
,
crying
,
“
Oh
,
find
them
!
<EOS>
Find
them
,
and
I
shallbe
happy
.
<EOS>
”“This
<EOS>
very
day
shall
be
devoted
to
inquiries
,
”
said
Seyton
.
<EOS>
“
I
amgreatly
interested
by
all
that
has
occurred
,
and
perchance
it
willwithdraw
my
mind
from
sorrows
and
disappointments
of
my
own
,
to
turn
mymind
and
energies
to
unravel
the
mystery
connected
with
your
prettyplaymate
.
<EOS>
”Albert
,
looked
his
gratitude
,
and
after
the
morning
’s
scanty
meal
wasdespatched
,
he
saw
his
father
depart
upon
his
promised
expedition
witha
heart
elate
with
hope
and
expectant
joy
.
<EOS>
For
a
time
the
youthful
Albert
remained
at
home
in
deep
thought
;
thenhe
suddenly
rose
,
saying
,
“
Why
should
I
be
idle
?
<EOS>
I
may
do
something
inthis
matter
.
<EOS>
Just
Heaven
!
<EOS>
If
that
bad
man
should
have
murdered
him?Alas
!
<EOS>
My
poor
—
poor
Harry
.
<EOS>
My
mind
misgives
me
,
that
he
loves
you
not
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
had
I
but
some
clue
—
<EOS>
some
means
of
commencing
in
the
right
path
ofinquiry
<EOS>
,
I
should
then
have
some
hope
.
<EOS>
”So
<EOS>
saying
,
with
a
desponding
air
,
the
youth
left
the
house
and
wanderedonwards
without
any
definite
idea
of
whither
he
was
going
or
how
he
wasto
set
about
his
self
imposed
task
of
endeavouring
to
discover
theretreat
of
Jacob
Gray
and
the
young

XI.Learmont
in
London.—The
Endeavour

Thought.—Life

Gold
that
Glitters
.
<EOS>
Many
spacious
mansions
which
adorned
the
old
city
of
Westminster
at
thedate
of
our
story
have
long
since
been
swept
from
the
ground
to
giveplace
to
more
modern
structures
,
and
where
the
stately
home
of
thenoble
or
wealthy
commoner
reared
its
lofty
walls
are
now
to
be
seen
butlines
of
streets
,
and
the
busy
hum
of
commerce
has
superseded
thestately
aristocratic
silence
which
used
to
reign
undisturbed
in
manyparts
of
the
ancient
district
.
<EOS>
In
a
mansion
of
princely
splendour
,
which
has
long
since
been
pulleddown
to
build
some
approaches
to
Westminster
Bridge
,
dwelt
the
head
ofthe
house
of
Learmont
,
whenever
business
or
inclination
called
him
tothe
metropolis
.
<EOS>
In
that
house
,
however
,
as
yet
,
the
present
Squire
ofLearmont
had
never
resided
.
<EOS>
He
had
resided
in
deep
seclusion
ever
sincehe
had
been
acknowledged
as
the
head
of
his
house
.
<EOS>
A
small
part
of
hishistory
was
well
known
,
but
there
were
darker
portions
which
the
publiceye
might
in
vain
attempt
to
fathom
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
younger
brother
of
thehouse
he
now
represented
,
but
his
senior
,
from
deep
distress
at
theloss
of
a
young
and
lovely
wife
in
the
first
year
of
his
marriage
,
hadresolved
by
travelling
in
foreign
countries
,
to
endeavour
to
forget
hisirreparable
loss
,
leaving
the
present
squire
in
undisputed
authorityover
his
domains
and
extensive
property
.
<EOS>
Then
shortly
came
news
of
thedecease
,
at
Rome
,
of
the
elder
brother
.
<EOS>
The
present
squire
entered
onhis
own
account
into
undisputed
possession
of
the
vast
accumulatedproperty
,
for
the
relatives
of
the
family
were
very
few
and
verydistant
.
<EOS>
This
was
all
that
was
really
known
of
the
history
of
SquireLearmont
,
and
his
sudden
determination
,
after
nearly
fourteen
years
ofseclusion
,
to
visit
London
,
and
launch
out
into
a
style
of
expensiveliving
which
,
although
it
was
well
known
he
could
afford
,
yetastonished
everybody
,
were
the
themes
of
very
general
gossip
.
<EOS>
The
oldmansion
had
been
hastily
put
in
order
for
his
reception
.
<EOS>
The
complementof
servants
was
greatly
increased
;
an
immense
sum
was
spent
in
costlyliveries
and
interior
adornments
;
expectation
was
on
the
utmoststretch
,
and
when
Learmont
did
arrive
and
stalked
into
his
ancienthouse
,
he
created
a
scarcely
less
sensation
than
as
if
he
had
been
somepetty
monarch
.
<EOS>
No
one
liked
the
dark
penetrating
eye
that
scowled
around
,
as
ifsuspicious
of
everything
and
everybody
,
but
there
was
no
absolute
stainupon
his
character
;
moreover
he
was
immensely
rich
,
and
reported
,
ofcourse
,
to
be
a
great
deal
richer
than
he
really
was
,
so
that
when
itbecame
known
that
he
intended
to
give
a
series
of
entertainments
,
unequalled
in
effect
and
magnificence
by
any
commoner
,
numbers
of
oldfriends
of
the
family
sprung
up
from
all
quarters
,
and
had
his
spacioushalls
been
ten
times
as
spacious
he
would
have
found
no
difficulty
infilling
them
with
glittering
throngs
whenever
he
chose
.
<EOS>
Certainly
Learmont
seemed
to
be
at
the
height
of
his
ambition
.
<EOS>
Thepossessor
of
a
princely
revenue
which
had
been
allowed
to
accumulate
,
first
by
his
elder
brother
,
who
was
a
man
of
frugal
habits
,
for
severalyears
,
and
then
by
himself
,
for
a
number
of
years
more
,
until
he
foundhimself
possessed
of
a
sum
of
money
in
actual
cash
,
which
had
theworthy
associates
,
Britton
and
Gray
,
but
fancied
to
be
a
third
of
itsreal
amount
,
would
materially
have
assisted
them
in
putting
a
highprice
upon
their
services
whatever
they
were
.
<EOS>
On
the
evening
of
his
arrival
,
Learmont
sat
alone
and
silent
for
aconsiderable
time
in
the
magnificent
library
of
his
mansion
;
then
,
whenhe
could
no
longer
look
upon
the
gorgeous
hangings
and
superbdecorations
of
the
apartment
,
in
consequence
of
the
rapidly
darkeningsky
<EOS>
,
he
rung
a
small
silver
hand
-
bell
which
was
immediately
answered
bya
page
,
attired
in
crimson
and
gold
livery
,
who
waited
respectfully
fororders
.
<EOS>
“Bid
<EOS>
my
steward
,
”
said
Learmont
,
“
with
my
chamberlain
and
the
officersof
the
several
departments
of
my
household
,
attend
me
with
lights
.
<EOS>
Iwill
walk
through
the
house
.
<EOS>
”The
page
-
bowed
and
retired
.
<EOS>
“Yes
,
”
muttered
Learmont
,
when
he
was
again
alone
,
“
I
will
sate
my
eyeswith
gazing
upon
the
glorious
magnificence
I
have
wanted
for
so
long
;
Iwill
see
the
glitter
and
the
beauty
of
what
I
have
so
dearly
purchased
.
<EOS>
Attended
by
those
who
are
taught
to
watch
the
slightest
indication
ofmy
pleasure
,
I
will
traverse
the
stately
and
gorgeous
mansion
,
whichyears
since
I
used
to
wildly
dream
might
once
be
mine
,
and
smile
when
Iawoke
to
think
of
the
extreme
improbability
of
the
vision
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
door
was
now
thrown
open
and
the
same
page
who
had
before
attendedupon
Learmont
,
respectfully
announced
that
his
commands
had
beenobeyed
,
and
that
his
servants
were
in
waiting
to
escort
him
over
hismansion
.
<EOS>
He
rose
from
his
seat
and
strode
with
a
haughty
air
to
the
door
,
“
Leadthe
way
,
”
he
cried
,
“
I
’ll
follow
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
servants
bowed
,
and
while
some
preceded
him
,
conveying
large
waxlights
,
others
again
followed
,
so
that
a
full
glare
of
light
was
thrownupon
the
path
of
the
proud
man
,
who
had
purged
his
very
soul
for
thepurpose
of
procuring
such
purchased
and
empty
homage
.
<EOS>
Saloon
after
saloon
was
traversed
,
and
in
each
Learmont
paused
andordered
the
chandeliers
and
clustering
lamps
to
be
lighted
,
in
orderthat
he
might
judge
of
the
effect
by
night
of
the
gorgeous
decorationsof
those
noble
apartments
.
<EOS>
Everything
rich
or
rare
that
money
couldproduce
was
there
congregated
.
<EOS>
The
walls
were
hung
with
the
most
superbtapestry
;
the
ceilings
were
freshly
and
vigorously
painted
by
artistsof
celebrity
,
and
the
highly
polished
oaken
floors
shone
like
mirrors
,
reflecting
all
the
brilliancy
and
lustre
of
both
roof
and
walls
.
<EOS>
The
heart
of
Learmont
swelled
with
pride
and
triumph
as
he
glancedround
upon
all
this
luxury
and
refinement
,
and
whispered
to
himself
“
itis
mine
—
all
mine
.
<EOS>
”“Lead
<EOS>
on
,
”
was
his
only
cry
as
room
after
room
was
lighted
and
examined
.
<EOS>
Now
the
mansion
had
been
nearly
traversed
,
and
the
chandeliers
andlamps
being
kept
lighted
,
the
whole
house
shone
and
glittered
withunparalleled
brilliancy
.
<EOS>
There
was
but
one
other
state
-
apartment
whichLearmont
had
not
visited
,
and
that
was
a
spacious
ball
-
room
,
upon
whichan
enormous
sum
had
been
lavished
.
<EOS>
He
wished
,
he
hoped
to
be
greatlystruck
by
the
splendour
of
that
noble
room
,
and
he
sent
the
domesticson
before
to
light
its
numerous
lustres
,
in
order
that
he
might
judgeof
its
first
effect
upon
the
eye
as
any
one
entered
it
.
<EOS>
The
steward
of
the
household
returned
to
say
that
all
was
ready
,
andpreceding
his
master
with
a
long
white
wand
in
his
hand
,
tipped
withgold
,
he
led
the
way
to
the
ball
-
room
.
<EOS>
“Perfect
!
<EOS>
”
was
the
exclamation
of
Learmont
,
when
he
stood
in
the
centreof
that
hall
.
<EOS>
To
attempt
a
description
of
it
would
be
in
vain
.
<EOS>
It
wasone
gorgeous
glitter
;
all
that
mirrors
,
gilding
,
hangings
,
painting
,
lights
and
flowers
could
do
to
render
it
a
scene
of
enchantment
wasdone
.
<EOS>
Learmont
’s
colour
deepened
with
pride
as
he
looked
around
him
and
couldsee
nothing
that
he
would
have
altered
.
<EOS>
All
was
as
he
wished
,
and
hefelt
conscious
that
such
another
apartment
was
not
to
be
found
inLondon
.
<EOS>
“This
is
the
broad
path
to
honour
and
distinction
,
”
he
muttered
tohimself
.
<EOS>
“
If
you
would
be
regarded
among
men
as
little
short
of
adivinity
,
you
have
but
to
throw
gold
-
dust
in
their
eyes
,
and
throughthat
glittering
medium
they
will
see
you
are
a
very
god
.
<EOS>
”Now
<EOS>
there
suddenly
burst
upon
the
air
from
a
balcony
at
the
further
endof
the
hall
,
a
strain
of
exquisite
music
.
<EOS>
The
lofty
room
echoed
withthe
melodious
strains
,
and
when
the
gay
and
spirit
-
stirring
strainswere
over
the
steward
advanced
with
a
self
-
satisfied
air
,
and
said,“Sir
<EOS>
,
those
are
the
musicians
you
are
pleased
to
order
should
beengaged
to
wait
upon
your
pleasure
,
as
part
of
your
household
,
<EOS>
Ithought
your
worship
might
be
pleased
to
judge
of
their
skill
and
theeffect
of
their
music
in
this
apartment
.
<EOS>
”“’Tis
<EOS>
well
,
”
said
Learmont
,
inclining
his
head
.
<EOS>
“
Bid
them
play
again
.
<EOS>
”Obedient
<EOS>
to
a
signal
,
the
musicians
again
filled
the
air
with
joyoussounds
,
and
Learmont
stood
and
listened
with
delight
,
forgetting
inthose
moments
everything
but
his
own
present
greatness
and
wealth
.
<EOS>
“Yes
,
”
he
said
,
when
the
strain
ceased
,
as
if
pursuing
a
previous
trainof
thought
:
“
this
is
the
way
to
forget
.
<EOS>
Steep
the
senses
in
enjoyment
,
and
the
conscience
will
have
no
room
for
action
;
wine
,
music
,
thedance

the
smile
of

,
all

contribute
to

a
domestic
.
<EOS>
“Say
<EOS>
I
am
occupied
,
”
replied
Learmont
,
and
he
again
resumed
his
glowingmeditations
.
<EOS>
“
Nobility
,
”
he
muttered
,
“

crowd
to
my
fêtes

But

<EOS>

<EOS>
I
will
be
ennobled
and—”“Your

”
said
the
servant
,
returning
,
“
<EOS>
but
;
the

not
take
a

.
”“Ha

<EOS>
He

”“Have

<EOS>
To

talking
about

Old
Smithy
.
<EOS>
”Learmont
<EOS>
caught
the
muttered
words
of
the
man
as
he
was
hurrying
fromthe
hall
,
and
a
cry
of
pain
and
horror
escaped
him
as
he
rushedforward
,
and
seizing
the
terrified
servant
by
the
arm
,
he
cried—“What
—
what
manner
of
man
is
he
who
seeks
me
with
such
pertinacity?”“A
rough
knave
,
an

coarse

<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
—
and
he
said
—
<EOS>
what?”“He
said
he
brought
a
message
from
the
Old
Smithy!”A
deadly
paleness
came
across
Learmont
’s
face
,
as
he
said
in
a
huskywhisper
,
“
Show
him
into
a
private
room
and
tell
him
I
will
be
with

.
<EOS>
Begone
,

,
nor
stand
gaping
there
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
terrified
servant
darted
from
the
hall
,
and
Learmont
turning
to
thethrong
of
domestics
who
were
standing
at
a
respectful
distance
fromhim
,
cried—“Lead
on
.
<EOS>
To
my

and
bid
yon

bring
me

<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
servants
hastened
to
throw
the
doors
wide
open
for
their
imperiousmaster
to
pass
out
,
but
his
mood
was
changed
.
<EOS>
The
glow
of
triumph
,
andgratified
pride
no
longer
lent
a
glow
to
his
sallow
cheek
,
nor
lit
uphis
deep

sunken
eyes
with
brilliancy

<EOS>
There
was
a
load
of
care
andanxiety
,
almost
amounting
to
agony
,
upon
his
face
.
<EOS>
His
contracted
browbespoke
deep
and
anxious

and
his
limbs
trembled
as
he
left
hishall
of
light

beauty
to

an
interview
with
the
man

he

CHAPTER
XII.The
Consequences
of
Crime.—A
Familiar
Friend.—A
Cloud
upon
Learmont’sFelicity
.
<EOS>
Being
informed
by
his
servants
that
his
visitor
had
been
shown
into
asmall
room
adjoining
the
library
,
Learmont
took
a
lamp
from
his
table
,
and
with
a
frowning
brow
and
compressed
lips
,
walked
towards
the
roomto
demand
of
Britton
,
for
he
guessed
too
well
<EOS>
it
was
he
,
<EOS>
the
cause
ofso
early
a
visit
.
<EOS>
When
he
entered
the
room
he
found
the
smith
lolling
,
at
his
ease
,
upona
costly
couch
,
and
although
he
did
rise
at
the
presence
of
Learmont
,
it
was
with
an
air
and
manner
of
extreme
insolence
.
<EOS>
“To
<EOS>
what
am
I
indebted
for
so
early
a
visit
,
or
rather
I
should
sayintrusion
?
”
<EOS>
asked
Learmont
in
a
low
hollow
voice
.
<EOS>
“Principally
,
”
said
Britton
with
an
air
of
perfect
indifference
,
“
toassure
you
that
I
had
arrived
in
London
,
perfectly
safe
.
”“Well
?
”
said
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“Aye
and
well
too
,
”
answered
the
smith
,
purposely
mistaking
the
other’smeaning
.
<EOS>
“
I
wish
to
know
,
likewise
,
if
you
have
seen
Jacob
Gray?”“I
have
not
,
”
replied
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“Know
you
,
squire
,
where
in
London
he
is
to
be
<EOS>
found?”“I
do
not
.
<EOS>
Has
he
not
confided
that
to
you?”“In
faith
,
he
has
not
.
<EOS>
In
vain
I
urged
him
to
tell
me
his
place
ofabode
,
and
if
I
know
not
where
to
find
him
how
can
I
carry
out
theproject
we
have
decided
upon?”“True
,
”
said
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“
There
must
be
found
some
means
.
<EOS>
Listen
to
me
:
when
next
Jacob
Gray
seeks
me
for
money
,
I
will
put
him
off
to
aparticular
hour
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
Be
you
then
,
at
that
hour
,
lurk
abouthere
,
and
follow
him
to
his
home
,
whither
<EOS>
he
will
most
likely
godirectly
,
having
a
sum
of
money
with
him
.
<EOS>
”“That
may
do
,
”
said
Britton
,
after
a
moment
’s
consideration
.
<EOS>
“
You
cansend
to
me
at
any
time
by
my
real

by

<EOS>
Yousee
,
squire
<EOS>
,
I
thought
it
handy
to
live
near
at
hand

”“Promise
<EOS>
me
—
swear
to
me
,
you
will
take
this
man
’s
life
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Learmontwith
sudden
vehemence
.
<EOS>
“I
have
no
particular
objection
to
take
his
life
,
”
replied
Britton
.
<EOS>
“And
<EOS>
the
boy?”“That
<EOS>
’s
as
circumstances
turn
out
,
squire
.
<EOS>
If
the
boy
knowsnothing
—
suspects
nothing—”“Aye
there
’s
the
doubt
.
<EOS>
Britton
,
dispose
of
Gray
,
and
your
reward
,
asyou
know
,
is
most
ample
.
<EOS>
Bring
,
then
,
that
boy
to
me

”“Agreed
.
<EOS>
You
shall
have
him
.
”“Thanks
<EOS>
,
good
Britton
;
and
—
and
when
you
bring
him
you
shall
not
be
fiveminutes
without
your
just
reward
.
<EOS>
”There
was
a
peculiarity
of
tone
and
manner
about
Learmont
as
he
utteredthese
words
,
which
startled
the
smith
,
and
he
looked
for
a
moment
ortwo
suspiciously
at
his
employer
,
then
he
said,—“Squire
<EOS>
Learmont
,
I
have
been
taught
an
useful
lesson
by
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
I
,
too
,
have
written
a
confession
,
and
lodged
it
in
a
place
of
safety
.
<EOS>
”“What
mean
you
?
”
said
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“This
—
that
if
I
should
die
suddenly
,
a
packet
of
papers
will
be
found
,
which
will
do
no
good
to
the
Squire
of
Learmont
.
<EOS>
You
understand
me
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
do
understand
you
,
”
said
Learmont
;
“
but
your
suspicions
aregroundless
.
<EOS>
”“Be
<EOS>
it
<EOS>
so
,
”
said
the
smith
.
<EOS>
“
It
’s
best
to
be
cautious
.
<EOS>
”“Take
<EOS>
what
precautions
you

”
replied
Learmont
;
“
but
keep
yourpromise
.
<EOS>
”“I
will
keep
it
,
”
cried
the
smith
;
“
for
I
hate
this
Jacob
Gray
,
although
he
has
made
me
know
my
own
value
.
<EOS>
”“Know
your
value
—
what
mean
<EOS>
you?”“It
was
Jacob
Gray
who
told
me
there
were
documents
of
some
importanceabout
the
body
of—”“Hush

hush

<EOS>
cried
Learmont
<EOS>
;
“
name

it
is
enough

<EOS>
But
tell
me
,
why
did
Gray
inform
you
of
the
existence
of
those
papers
instead
ofsecuring
them
<EOS>
himself?”“He
lacked
the

<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
yet
I
must
take
your

say?”“Squire

Learmont

”“Enough

Learmont.—“I

”“So

Britton

Learmont

<EOS>
“I

Britton

the

takes
me

”
replied
thesmith
,
insolently
.
<EOS>
Learmont
evidently
made
a
great
effort
to
subdue
his
rage
,
and
he
said
,
in
half
-
choked
accents,—“Name
<EOS>
your
price

<EOS>
”“Ten
pieces
,
”
said
the
smith

<EOS>
Learmont
took
his
purse
from
his
pocket
,
and
without
a
word
,
countedout
required
sum
,
and
then
stood
with
his
lamp
in
his
hand
waiting
forthe

leave

“You

<EOS>

Britton
,
in
anaggravating
voice

<EOS>
The
dark
eye
of
Learmont
flashed
with
rage
;

he
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
“Oh

well

cried
Britton
;
“

”The
lamp
trembled
in
the
hand
of
Learmont
as
he
thought—“Oh
,
<EOS>
that
formy
own
safety
’s
sake
<EOS>
I
dared
plunge
a
dagger
to

,
however
,
seemed
fully
to
feel
his
entire
safety
,
and
heevidently
felt
an
exquisite
enjoyment
in
the
agony
he
was
inflictingupon
Learmont
.
<EOS>
He
lounged
slowly
to
the
door
,
and
nodding
then
in
aninsolent
,
and
familiar
manner
,
he
crossed
the
hall
to
the
outer
door
,
while
Learmont
,
nearly
bursting
with
rage
,
sprung
up
the
marblestaircase
to
the
upper
apartment
of
the
house

<EOS>
“This
is

muttered
Britton
when
he
had
passed
out
into
thestreet

<EOS>
“
Humph

For

asthe

’s
First
Visit.—The
Dream
.
<EOS>
The
Squire
Learmont
’s
first
night
in
his
splendid
mansion
was
by
nomeans
an
agreeable
one
.
<EOS>
He
retired
to
rest
vexed
and
enraged
at
AndrewBritton
,
and
his
mind
in
a
chaos
of
conflicting
thoughts
how
to
ridhimself
of
the
insufferable
torment
of
the
threatened
visits
from
thatman
whose
very
name
would
have
been
sufficient
,
at
any
time
,
to
bring
achill
to
Learmont
’s
heart
,
and
dash
the
brimming
cup
of
joy
from
hislips
.
<EOS>
His
restless
slumbers
,
too
,
were
haunted
by
the
visionary
creations
ofhis
excited
fancy
.
<EOS>
One
moment
he
would
be
plunging
a
poniard
intoBritton
’s
heart
,
while
he
dragged
from
his
breast
the
papers
soimportant
to
his
peace
.
<EOS>
Then
again
,
at
the
moment
of
his
fanciedtriumph
,
the
scene
would
change
to
a
court
of
justice
,
and
a
voicearraigned
him
for
murder
!
<EOS>
In
such
fearful
and
disordered
fancies
washis
night
passed
,
and
he
rose
in
the
morning
pale
,
haggard
,
andun
-
refreshed
.
<EOS>
Hastily
attiring
himself
,
he
drew
aside
the
curtains
ofhis
chamber
-
window
,
which
commanded
an
extensive
and
pleasing
view
intoSt
.
<EOS>
James
’s
Park
.
<EOS>
It
was
yet
very
early
,
but
Learmont
thought
that
heshould
be
able
to
withdraw
his
mind
from
disagreeable
and
horriblereflections
by
healthful
walk
in
the
shady
Mall
.
<EOS>
He
accordingly
took
his
hat
and
sword
,
and
walked
from
his
house
by
agarden
-
gate
,
opening
into
a
narrow
lane
of
trees
,
which
terminated
inthe
park
itself
.
<EOS>
The
air
was
very
cold
,
for
frost
was
on
the
ground
,
and
the
trees
were
stripped
of
their
beautiful
verdure
;
but
it
wasexercise
that
Learmont
wanted
,
and
he
rather
rejoiced
than
otherwise
atthe
necessity
of
active
walking
,
inasmuch
as
he
hoped
exertion
of
bodywould
control
the
excitement
of
his
mind
.
<EOS>
The
canal
was
then
,
and
for
many
years
afterwards
,
a
mere
straightcutting
,
strongly
resembling
a
wet
dock
,
for
the
repair
of
ships
,
andas
little
ornamental
as
it
could
possibly
be
.
<EOS>
The
walks
,
however
,
inSt
.
<EOS>
James
’s
Park
,
were
then
preferable
to
what
they
are
now
,
for
manyold
trees
were
then
existence
that
have
now
perished
,
and
their
placesare
,
of
necessity
,
occupied
by
saplings
,
which
the
present
generationhave
been
kind
enough
to
plant
for
their
successors
.
<EOS>
Learmont
walked
very
quickly
over
the
frozen
ground
,
which
crackledlike
glass
under
the
feet
.
<EOS>
There
were
but
few
persons
at
that
earlyhour
abroad
,
although
the
day
gave
promise
of
being
one
of
those
clear
,
cold
,
frosty
ones
which
are
admired
by
a
great
many
persons
.
<EOS>
Approaching
,
however
,
from
the
direction
towards
which
he
wasproceeding
,
Learmont
observed
a
gentlemanly
-
looking
man
enveloped
in
alarge
cloak
.
<EOS>
By
some
sort
of
instinct
,
Learmont
seemed
to
feel
a
dreadof
this
stranger
’s
approach
,
although
he
could
not
at
all
recognise
inhim
,
at
the
distance
they
were
apart
,
the
gait
or
aspect
of
any
onethat
he
knew
.
<EOS>
Nearer
and
nearer
they
approached
each
other
;
and
,
sostrong
was
the
feeling
of
dread
in
the
breast
of
Learmont
,
<EOS>
that
,
had
itnot
been
for
his
stronger
curiosity
to
ascertain
who
it
was
,
he
wouldhave
turned
from
the
open
pathway
among
the
trees
,
whose
huge
trunkswould
have
effectually
hidden
him
from
observation
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
however
,
he
pursued
his
walk
until
he
and
the
stranger
with
the
cloak
camenearly
face
to
face
.
<EOS>
Then
,
as
the
stranger
lifted
up
his
eyes
,
whichhad
been
fixed
on
the
ground
in
a
meditative
manner
,
Learmont
knew
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
young
man
,
by
name
Frank
Hartleton
,
who
had
been
so
curiousand
suspicious
at
the
period
of
the
great
storm
at
Learmont
,
when
thewing
of
the
building
,
in
which
was
the
smithy
,
had
been
burnt
down
.
<EOS>
The
recognition
was
evidently
mutual
;
indeed
,
no
one
who
had
once
seenLearmont
could
easily
again
forget
him
;
and
,
although
a
great
personalchange
had
taken
place
in
the
appearance
of
Hartleton
,
yet
the
featuresof
all
who
had
taken
any
part
in
the
proceedings
of
that
eventful
nightat
<EOS>
the
little
village
of
Learmont
were
too
indelibly
impressed
upon
thememory
of
the
squire
for
him
to
find
any
difficulty
in
recognising
inthe
staid
,
and
somewhat
grave
,
gentleman
person
before
him
,
the
FrankHartleton
who
had
always
held
him
at
open
defiance
and
laughed
at
hispower
.
<EOS>
Hartleton
stopped
short
when
he
saw
Learmont
;
and
his
first
exclamationwas,—“This
is
strange
,
indeed!”“Sir
,
”
said
Learmont
,
“
did
you
address
me?”“Scarcely
,
”
replied
Hartleton
;
“
but
your
name
is
Learmont?”“Well
,
sir
?
”
<EOS>
replied
the
other
with
considerable
hauteur
.
<EOS>
“Do
<EOS>
you
know
me
,
Squire
Learmont?”“I
recognised
the
features
,
and
know
the
names
of
many
,
sir
,
”
saidLearmont
,
“
that
still
are
not
upon
my
roll
of
friends
or
acquaintances
.
<EOS>
”“You
do
know
me
,
”
said
Hartleton
,
“
I
have
no
desire
to
be
rude
to
you
,
Squire
Learmont
;
but
our
sudden
meeting
took
me
somewhat
by
surprise
,
and
the
exclamation
that
I
uttered
arose
from
the
curious
coincidencethat
<EOS>
I
have
been
all
night
dreaming
of
you
and
the
village
of
Learmont
,
and
was
in
deep
thought
about
the
mysterious
occurrences
that
tookplace
three
years
ago
when
I
suddenly
came
upon
you
.
”If
<EOS>
his
hatred
and
dread
of
Hartleton
would
have
induced
Learmont
<EOS>
totreat
him
in
such
a
manner
that
he
could
not
address
him
,
his
guiltyfears
urged
him
to
prolong
the
conversation
,
in
order
to
discover
,
ifpossible
,
the
complexion
of
Hartleton
’s
thoughts
with
regard
to
him
,
that
he
might
know
if
he
had
anything
really
to
dread
from
thatquarter
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
therefore
,
with
more
courtesy
that
he
said,—“The
coincidences
are
curious
.
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
—
I
believe
I
speak
to
Sir
FrancisHartleton
now?”“Yes
,
”
replied
Hartleton
;
<EOS>
“
I
was
,
you
recollect
,
destined
for
the
law
,
which
my
small
patrimony
just
enabled
me
to
enter
with
credit
.
<EOS>
I
am
nowa
justice
,
and
a
knight
,
as
you
say
.
<EOS>
”“I
give
you
joy
,
sir
,
of
your
advancement
,
”
said
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“You
are
very
kind
,
”
replied
Hartleton
,
fixing
his
eyes
upon
thecountenance
of
Learmont
in
a
manner
that
it
required
all
the
firmnessof
the
latter
not
to
quail
under
.
<EOS>
“Might
<EOS>
I
presume
so
far
,
”
said
Learmont
,
“
as
to
ask
,
what
were
thethoughts
concerning
me
that
engaged
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
<EOS>
even
now?”“I
was
thinking
of
the
mysterious
man
,
”
said
Hartleton
,
“
who
rushedwith
such
wild
gestures
and
shrieks
from
the
burning
house
.
<EOS>
”Learmont
<EOS>
strove
to
command
his
features
to
indifference
;
but
,
theeffort
was
almost
beyond
his
power
,
and
he
spoke
to
endeavour
to
coverhis
agitation
.
<EOS>
“It
was
very
strange
,
”
he
said
;
“
most
singular!”“And
the
little
child
,
too
,
that
he
had
in
his
arms
,
”
continuedHartleton
;
“
what
can
have
become
of
that?”“Ay
<EOS>
—
what
?
”
said
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“Did
<EOS>
you
never
get
any
clue
,
Squire
Learmont
,
to
these
mysteriouscircumstances
,
which
must
have
greatly
interested
<EOS>
you?”“Interested
me
?
<EOS>
How?”“Inasmuch
as
they
occurred
upon
your
estate
,
and
among
your
owntenants
.
<EOS>
”“True
<EOS>
—
most
true
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
—
<EOS>
I
was
—
and
am
much
interested
;
but
<EOS>
I
knownothing
—
have
heard
nothing
,
and
have
no
clue
to
unravel
the
mystery
.
<EOS>
”“We
<EOS>
must
only
hope
,
”
said
Hartleton
,
“
that
some
of
these
days
,
accidentas
it
generally
does
,
will
throw
a
light
upon
the
subject
,
and
give
itto
us
in
all
its
details
.
<EOS>
”An
<EOS>
awful
expression
came
across
the
face
of
Learmont
as

“Yes

As

May
I
ask
what
yourimpression

have
scarcely
an

replied
Hartleton;“we

you

cautious

we
take
upimpressions

<EOS>
”“Exceedingly
<EOS>
proper
is
such
caution

said
Learmont
;
“

<EOS>
”“Exactly

replied
Hartleton
;
“

I
have
no

“I

“Do

<EOS>
“Well

my

changed

I

I

dripping
with
unwholesomemoisture

<EOS>
creeping

all
around

in

I
saw—”“Yes

Learmont

<EOS>
“
W

what
saw
you?”“A
mouldering
skeleton

<EOS>
”“Indeed!”“Yes
,
and
the
most
curious
circumstance

that

ofit
I
constantly
heard

”“’Tis

Learmont

<EOS>
“Most

Hartleton

again
my

”“What

I
heard

<EOS>
”“My

you
were
asked
to
plead

cold
sweat
broke
out
upon
the
forehead

Learmont

he
could
notanswer

Hartleton
added,—“It

<EOS>
Learmont
stood
for
a
few
moments
gazing
after
the
retreating
figure
ofSir
Francis
Hartleton
;
then
,
shaking
his
clenched
hand
in
the
directionhe
was
proceeding

he

between
his

”So
<EOS>
saying
,
with
a
dark
scowl
upon

the
squire
retraced
hissteps
towards
his
own
house

<EOS>
The
morning
sun
was
now
gilding
withbeauty
the
housetops
,
and
the
icicles
,
which

pendant
from

shone
like

<EOS>
Unheedful
,
however

of
the
beauties
of

around

the
wealthy
Learmont
passed
onwards
,
his
thoughts
,
dark
and
gainful
as
they
were
,
fully
absorbing
all
hisattention
.
<EOS>
He
passed
up
the
little
lane
which
was
the
nearest
route
tohis
own
house
;
and
,
as
he
was
about
to
emerge
from
it
,
he
was
startled(for
<EOS>

guilty

ever
timid
)
by
some
one
touching
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
Turning
quickly
round
,
he
saw
Jacob
Gray
,
with
a
sickly
,
disagreeablesmile
upon
his
face
,
standing
close
to
him
.
<EOS>
“Your

Gray

<EOS>
“Yes

been

<EOS>
Your

sought

found
youwere

,
as
I
knew
it
was
much
the
custom

to
gather
an
appetite

<EOS>
”“I

<EOS>
“

<EOS>
”“As

said
Gray
;
“
but
methought
there
was
aninclination

Now

<EOS>
”Learmont
was
exceedingly
impatient
during
this
speech
,
and
,
at
itsconclusion

he
said
,
in
a
vexed
tone,—“Well

with
a
bow

more

burlesque
mockery
in

respect

<EOS>
Learmont
turned
haughtily
from
him
,
and
in
a
few
moments
he
entered
thegardens
of
his
mansion
,
by
the

private

he
hadproceeded
to

<EOS>
He
ordered

took
an
opportunity

it

”The

respectfully
retired
to
communicate
the

,
after
a
pause
of
thought

said

in
a

announced

“Bring

Learmont

<EOS>
The
moment
the
servant
had
left
the
room

and
closed
thedoor
behind
him

Gray
seated
himself
with
an
air
of
insolentfamiliarity
,
which
,
under
any
other
circumstances
,
would
have
produceda
storm
of
passion

,
severe

was
the
struggle

him

he
neverthelesssucceeded

“You

When

he
stood
for

in

Gray
’s
cunning
teach
him
that
the
difficulty
offollowing
a
person
crossing
the
river
was
immeasurably
greater
than
onshore
,
for
,
if
followed
by
a
boat
,
concealment
of
the
person
pursuingwould
be
nearly
out
of
the
question
,
and
to
make
a
palpable
detour
<EOS>
forthe
sake
of
crossing
a
bridge
would
most
probably
ensure
the
completeescape
of
the
watched
party
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
did
not
know
that
he
waswatched
,
but
he
knew
that
,
had
he
been
Learmont
,
and
Learmont
,
Gray
,
hewould
then
have
been
watched
with
the
keenest
of
eyes
that
could
beprocured
for
that
duty
.
<EOS>
When
the
boatman
neared
the
centre
of
the
stream
,
Jacob
Gray
desiredhim
to
pause
upon
his
oars
for
a
few
moments
,
ostensibly
that
he
,
Gray
,
might
admire
the
bright
sunshine
on
the
frosted
spires
of
the
variouschurches
,
but
really
to
see
if
any
other
boat
was
about
leaving
thepoint
from
which
he
had
started
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
he
disappointed
;
for
scarcelyhad
the
wherry
floated
idly
in
the
stream
for
a
few
brief
seconds
,
whenJacob
observed
a
boat
push
off
,
in
which
were
two
rowers
,
and
a
thirdmuffled
in
a
cloak
,
and
seated
very
low
in
the
stern
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
waterman
was
now
upon
the
point
of
urging
his
boat
forward
again
,
when
Gray
said
quietly:—“Hold
still
a
moment
,
my
friend
.
<EOS>
Your
time
shall
be
paid
for
.
<EOS>
Surelyyon
boat
is
making
speed
through
the
water
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
waterman
looked
in
the
direction
of
the
wherry
with
the
two
rowers
,
and
exclaimed:—“Some
one
is
in
haste
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
no,—they
are
pulling
but
lazily
suddenly
.
<EOS>
”Gray
<EOS>
’s
small
eyes
twinkled
as
he
replied:—“I
have
altered
my
mind
;
row
easily
up
the
stream
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
boat
’s
head
was
turned
in
the
required
direction
,
and
the
waterman
,
with
regular
and
long
sweeps
of
his
oars
,
propelled
the
wherry
towardsWestminster
Bridge
,
and
presently
glided
beneath
one
of
its
gloomyarches
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
moments
the
rowers
in
the
boat
in
which
Jacob
Graysuspected
was
some
one
upon
his
track
,
appeared
quite
undecided
what
todo
;
then
,
in
obedience
to
some
order
apparently
from
the
cloakedfigure
,
they
gently
followed
in
the
wake
of
Gray
’s
wherry
.
<EOS>
“So
,
”
muttered
Gray
to
himself
between
his
clenched
teeth
;
<EOS>
“
I
amfollowed;—and
with
what
intent?—my
safe
destruction
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
Waterman
,
”
he
said
,
in
a
louder
tone
,
“
we
are
going
with
the
tide?”“Scarcely
,
”
replied
the
man
;
“
it
is
just
on
the
turn
.
<EOS>
”“When
it
is
fairly
running
down
,
”
said
Gray
,
“
I
will
go
back
.
<EOS>
Keep
on
,
however
,
as
you
are
for
a
short
time
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
waterman
now
shading
his
eyes
with
one
hand
from
the
sun
,
while
theoar
idly
played
in
the
rollocks
,
said:—“It
seems
to
me
,
master
,
that
yon
skiff
is
following
us
for
somereason
.
”“Indeed
!
”
says
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
What
have
you
been
doing
,
that
you
should
befollowed
on
the
Thames?”“I
doing
!
”
<EOS>
cried
the
man
.
<EOS>
“Ay.—You
<EOS>
suspect
you
are
followed
.
<EOS>
”“Mayhap
<EOS>
it
’s
yourself
,
master
<EOS>
,
they
follow
,
”
remarked
the
man
,
rathersurlily
.
<EOS>
Gray
smiled
as
he
replied:—“Oh
,
no;—they
suspect
you
of
being
one
of
the
notorious
pirates
of
theThames
we
have
heard
so
much
of
lately
.
<EOS>
”“The
tide
has
turned
,
”
said
the
waterman
,
looking
into
the
stream
as
itappeared
,
in
preference
to
making
any
reply
to
this
vague
charge
.
<EOS>
“Hark
ye
!
”
<EOS>
said
Gray
,
as
if
a
sudden
thought
had
struck
up
in
hisbrain
.
<EOS>
“
If
you
are
inclined
sometimes
to
earn
more
money
at
once
than
ayear
’s
plying
as
waterman
on
the
river
could
produce
you
,
it
ispossible
I
may
throw
a
job
in
your
way
.
<EOS>
”The
man
glanced
uneasily
at
Gray
,
as
he
replied
in
a
low
<EOS>
tone,—“Your
lordship
might
trust
me
—
<EOS>
if—”“If
<EOS>
what
,
my
friend?”“If
I
might
trust
your
worship
.
<EOS>
”“You
may
,
or
rather
the
trusting
is
all
on
my
side
.
<EOS>
All
I
want
of
youis
this
;
when
I
shall
some
day
give
you
notice
that
I
shall
want
awherry
at
a
particular
hour
and
at
the
stairs
I
shall
name

will
you
bethere?”“Certainly
,
”
replied
the
man
.
<EOS>
“
But
that
is
not
quite
all?”“You
are
right
,
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
I
shall
bring
one
with
me
;
we
will
takewith
us
wherewithal
to
make
us
merry
.
<EOS>
I
am
abstemious
,
but
my
friend
isnot

and
I
have
often
told
him
that
some
of
these
days
,
when
drinkingin
a
wherry
he
will
become
so
confused
,
that
he
will
accidentally
fallinto
the

<EOS>
do
you
understand?”“I

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
”“I
am
sure
you
do
,
”
added
Gray
.
<EOS>
The
man
nodded
.
<EOS>
“Your
reward
shall
be
ample
,
”
continued
his
tempter
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
do
n’t
see
why
I
should
turn
away
a
job
,
”
said
the
man
;
“
if
I

it
,
some
one
else
would
,
of

.
<EOS>
”“A
very
true
remark
,
”
cried
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
You
consent
then
to
do
thislittle
<EOS>
service?”“I

<EOS>
”“Give
<EOS>
me
<EOS>
your

”“That

”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
Now
turn
your

’s
head
and
go
back
withthe

<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
wherry
,
with
the
two
rowers
,
had
kept
at
a
considerable
distance
inthe
rear
;
and
now
that
Gray
’s
boat
was
suddenly
turned
and
rapidlygoing
down
the
stream
,
there
seemed
some
little
confusion
on
board
theother
wherry
;
but
before
the
two
boats
could
meet
or
pass
each
other
,
the
pursuers
had
shot
off
on
one
side
,
as
if
with
the
intention
oflanding
near
Westminster
.
<EOS>
“Follow
them
<EOS>
,
”
cried
Gray
;
“
and
wherever
they
land
,
do
you
land
me
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
waterman
was
a
powerful
man
,
and
he
bent
to
the
oars
with
sucheffect
,
that
the
wherry
shot
through
the
water
with
amazing
speed
.
<EOS>
It
was
curious
to
see
the
pursued
become
the
pursuers
,
for
such
seemedto
be
the
state
of
things
,
as
no
sooner
did
it
become
evident
thatJacob
Gray
’s
<EOS>
waterman
was
making
fast
for
the
boat
with
the
two
rowers
,
than
in
obedience
to
a
violent
gesture
from
the
person
in
the
cloakthey
pulled
rigorously
towards
the
shore
.
<EOS>
“I
must
see
that
man
in
the
cloak
,
”
said
Gray
,
“
if
it
be
possible
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
waterman
said
nothing
,
but
with
his
long
sinewy
arms
,
he
tooktremendous
sweeps
with
the
oars
,
and
sent
the
boat
forward
at
each
pullwith
a
force
that
astonished
Gray
.
<EOS>
The
two
wherries
were
not
now
above
a
quarter
of
the
width
of
the
riverapart
from
each
other
,
when
the
foremost
one
ran
upon
the
muddy
beach
,
and
the
man
,
in
the
cloak
springing
up
,
made
an
effort
to
jump
onshore
,
in
which
he
fell
over
the
seats
of
the
boat
.
<EOS>
In
the
next
momentthe
other
wherry
was
within
two
boats
’
lengths
of
the
shore
.
<EOS>
With
an
oath
,
the
cloaked
-
man
scrambled
to
his
feet
,
and
withoutturning
,
rushed
on
shore
,
and
was
soon
lost
to
sight
among
the
meanhabitations
that
crowded
the
banks
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
“It
is
the
smith
!
”
<EOS>
muttered
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
I
see
it
all

”Again
<EOS>
the
wherry
shot
into
the
stream
,
and
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
thewater
,
Jacob
Gray
appeared
absorbed
in
deep
thought
.
<EOS>
The
boat
’s
head
grated
against
some
stone
steps
that
were
on
theopposite
landing
,
and
Gray
sprung
to
his
feet
,
and
stepped
on
shore
.
<EOS>
Handing
the
waterman
then
a
liberal
gratuity
,
and
whispering
in
his
earthe
word
<EOS>
“

he
walked
at

rapid
pace

CHAPTER
XVI.The
Lone
House
in
Ancient
Lambeth.—The
Boy.—A
Solitary
Heart
.
<EOS>
In
a
district
of
Lambeth
,
which
is
now
the
mart
of
trade
,
but
which
atthe
period
of
our
narrative
was
scarcely
inhabited
,
and
consisted
butof
a
mass
of
old
melancholy
-
looking
buildings
,
which
had
been
longsince
condemned
as
dangerous
,
there
stood
one
house
in
particular
,
theexterior
of
which
presented
to
the
eye
an
appearance
of
such
utterdecay
that
it
would
have
required
an
adventurous
person
to
venturewithin
its
crumbling
walls
and
mossy
prisons
,
who
,
for
the
sake
of
ashort
cut
to
some
of
the
high
roads
<EOS>
passed
the
old
building
,
would
walkout
into
the
road
way
rather
than
run
even
the
momentary
risk
ofwalking
close
to
its
dilapidated
walls
.
<EOS>
The
world
,
however
,
is
ever
being
taken
in
by
appearances
.
<EOS>
Not
only
wasthis
house
much
stronger
and
more
substantial
than
its
neighbours
,
butwithin
it
<EOS>
there
was
a
degree
of
comfort
and
even
luxury
which
no
onecould
for
a
moment
have
surmised
.
<EOS>
It
is
true
the
windows
were
eitherbroken
,
or
so
much
begrimed
with
dirt
that
it
was
impossible
to
say
ifthey
were
glass
or
not
,
and
here
and
there
a
brick
was
displaced
sonaturally
that
it
seemed
to
have
fallen
out
by
the
natural
decayincidental
to
the
age
of
the
structure
.
<EOS>
Such
,
however
was
not
the
case
,
for
these
signs
and
tokens
of
insecurity
had
been
manufactured
in
thesilence
of
the
night
for
the
express
purpose
of
deterring
any
personfrom
entering
the
gloomy
house
,
or
supposing
for
a
moment
that
it
wasinhabited
by
other
than
rats
and
mice
.
<EOS>
There
were
no
persons
living
very
close
to
this
wretched
-
lookingresidence
,
and
the
poor
squalid
creatures
,
who
did
occasionally
seek
ashelter
for
a
few
nights
in
some
of
the
“
condemned
”
houses
,
neverapproached
that
one
,
for
it
had
the
reputation
of
being
haunted
,
inasmuch
as
twice
had
strangers
,
in
passing
through
the
locality
afternightfall
,
called
attention
to
lights
dimly
observable
in
the
house
,
and
once
a
man
had
entered
a
little
hostelry
in
the
immediateneighbourhood
,
and
while
his
tongue
clove
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
withfear
,
and
he
trembled
in
every
limb
<EOS>
,
he
said
he
had
seen
a
sight
at
oneof
the
lower
windows
of
that
particular
house
,
which
he
would
not
seeagain
for
his
soul
’s
sake
,
and
after
fortifying
himself
with
a
bumperof
spiced
canary
,
he
had
taken
his
leave
,
being
firmly
believed
,
andleaving
behind
the
character
of
the
house
,
which
lost
nothing
by
beingrepeated
from
mouth
to
mouth
,
and
which
produced
so
powerful
an
effectupon
the
superstitious
inhabitants
of
the
vicinity
that
it
is
doubtfulif
any
bribe
of
sufficient
magnitude
could
possibly
be
offered
toinduce
any
one
of
them
ever
to
pass
it
even
after
at
sunset
.
<EOS>
Into
this
mysterious
house
we
will
conduct
the
reader
.
<EOS>
The
room
towhich
we
would
direct
attention
was
small
,
but
by
no
means
destitute
ofcomforts
;
a
wood
fire
burnt
within
the
grate
,
and
its
low
flickeringlight
disclosed
several
articles
of
domestic
convenience
about
theapartment
.
<EOS>
The
only
coarse
appearance
the
place
had
was
owing
to
somerough
ragged
edged
planks
being
nailed
across
the
window
on
the
inside
,
so
as
effectually
to
close
it
against
the
egress
of
any
wanderingstream
of
light
from
the
fire
.
<EOS>
The
room
was
consequently
dark
,
for
the
process
of
preventing
thefire
-
light
from
showing
through
the
window
likewise
excluded
thedaylight
,
and
,
although
it
was
mid
-
day
without
,
that
apartmentpresented
the
appearance
of
midnight
within
.
<EOS>
Stretched
on
the
hearth
before
the
fire
was
a
large
gaunt
-
looking
dog
,
apparently
in
a
deep
slumber
,
and
sitting
on
an
old
-
fashioned
chair
,
with
his
head
buried
in
his
hands
,
and
resting
on
the
table
,
was
theyoung
boy
,
who
has
been
already
introduced
to
the
reader
as
Harry
Gray
,
and
who
passed
as
a
nephew
of
wily
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
His
remarkable
long
andbeautiful
hair
fell
in
masses
upon
the
table
,
and
the
fine
lightglistened
on
the
glossy
ringlets
as
they
strayed
in
wild
luxurianceover
his
hands
.
<EOS>
So
still
was
that
young
creature
,
that
he
might
have
been
thoughtsleeping
,
and
,
perhaps
,
he
had
been
,
and
had
awakened
from
some
dreamsof
happiness
to
weep
,
for
a
deep
sob
burst
from
his
heart
,
and
lookingup
,
he
cried
,
in
accents
of
deep
misery
and
<EOS>
despair,—“I
am
very
unhappy
<EOS>
—
I
wish
I
could
die
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
dog
,
upon
the
sound
of
the
voice
,
immediately
rose
,
and
with
a
lowwhine
placed
his
fore
paws
upon
the
knee
of
the
boy
,
and
looked
in
hisface
with
an
expression
of
sagacious
affection
,
which
of
all
theinferior
animals
dogs
alone
are
capable
of
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
the
boy
did
not
heed
him
,
but
wept
bitterly
,
and
keptrepeating,—“If
I
could
but
die
—
if
I
could
but
die!”Then
passing
his
delicate
hands
across
his
brow
to
part
back
theclustering
hair
he
looked
in
the
face
of
the
dumb
animal
,
that
againwith
a
low
whine
claimed
his
attention
.
<EOS>
“You
love
me
,
”
he
cried
;
“
yes
—
yes
—
I
know
you
love
me
,
my
poor
dog
.
<EOS>
Ifound
you
starving
in
this
lone
house
,
and
made
a
friend
of
you
.
<EOS>
Icalled
you
‘
Joy

’
because
it
was
joy
to
me
to
find
you
,
and
I
can
talkto
you
,
and
fancy
that
you
understand
me
as
you
gaze
thus
at
me
withyour
honest
face
of
dumb
intelligence
.
<EOS>
There

;
youare
one
,
my
poor
dumb
Joy
,
and
the
—
the
other
—
I
shall
never
—
see
—
again
—
<EOS>
itwas
Albert
Seyton
,
and
he
has
left
me
—
even
he
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Albert
,
if
I
werefree
as
thou
art
,
and
thou
wert
hidden—”Sinking
<EOS>
his
head
upon
his
hands
,
again
the
beautiful
boy
burst
intotears
,
and
sobbed
so
bitterly
that
the
dog
howled
piteously
,
in
unisonwith
<EOS>
its
master
’s
grief
.
<EOS>
“Hush
—
hush
,
Joy
,
hush
!
”
<EOS>
said
,
the
boy
.
<EOS>
“
My
faithful
kind
friend
,
if
hehad
heard
you
,
you
would
have
an
unkind
word
and
a
blow
for
this
.
<EOS>
It
isweak
of
me
to
give
way
thus
to
tears
,
but
my
spirits
are
subdued
,
andmy
heart
is
nearly
broken
—
broken
—
broken
,
”
he
repeated
.
<EOS>
Then
suddenly
starting
to
his
feet
,
he
stood
for
a
few
moments
in
alistening
attitude
.
<EOS>
“’Tis
<EOS>
he
,
”
he
suddenly
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
“
Too
well
I
know
that
step
.
”In
<EOS>
another
moment
the
door
opened
,
and
Jacob
Gray
stood
on
thethreshold
of
the
apartment
.
<EOS>
His
look
was
ferocious
,
and
he
pointed
to
the
dog
as
he
said
,
or
rathergrowled
in
an
angry
tone,—“I
heard
that
cur
.
<EOS>
”Harry
laid
his
arm
over
the
dog
’s
neck
,
but
made
no
answer
.
<EOS>
“I
told
you
,
”
continued
Gray
striding
into
the
room—“I
<EOS>
told
you
that
Iwould
knock
out
the
brains
of
that
creature
if
ever
I
heard
it
bark
,
<EOS>
oreven
whine
too
loudly
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
boy
held
the
dog
tighter
as
Gray
advanced
and
said,—“Uncle
,
spare
him
this
once—’twas
my
fault
.
”“Pshaw
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Gray
,
“
<EOS>
I
tell
you
the
cur
shall
die
.
<EOS>
”A
<EOS>
flush
of
colour
came
across
the
face
of
the
boy
as
Gray
spoke
,
andpushing
the
dog
behind
him
<EOS>
,
he
drew
his
slim
figure
up
to
its
fullheight
,
and
confronted
Gray
with
his
dark
,
lustrous
eyes
,
flashing
withunusual
brilliancy
.
<EOS>
“Then
<EOS>
I
tell
you
he
shall
not
die
!
”
<EOS>
he
cried
firmly
.
<EOS>
Gray
for
a
moment
quailed
beneath
the
glance
of
that
singularlybeautiful
child
,
and
twice
he
tried
to
summon
courage
to
meet
that
lookof
proud
defiance
ere
<EOS>
he
could
accomplish
it
,
then
he
said
slowly,—“So
you
are
bold
.
<EOS>
How
long
is
it
since
you
have
plucked
up
<EOS>
so
muchspirit?”“From
the
moment
that
it
was
necessary
to
protect
the
only
friend
Ihave
against
your
violence
<EOS>
,
”
replied
the
boy
.
<EOS>
“Indeed
!
”
answered
Gray
.
<EOS>
“Aye
indeed
!
”
said
the
boy
,
trembling
with
excitement
.
<EOS>
“Your
<EOS>
only
friend
?
”
<EOS>
continued
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
Humph
!
<EOS>
You
think
more
,
then
,
ofthat
dog
than
of
me?”“The
hound
,
”
said
Harry
,
in
a
lower
tone
,
“
is
kind
,
affectionate
,
andfaithful—’tis
in
its
way
,
poor
thing
,
tender
and
devoted
;
<EOS>
Uncle
Gray
,
are
you
all
that?”Gray
laughed
hysterically
,
as
he
replied,—“Ha
!
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
Is
that
all
?
<EOS>
Have
you
quite
summed
up
the
virtues
of
yourhound?”“Its
virtues
,
”
said
Harry
,
“
are
much
to
me
,
for
they
are
the
only
onesI
have
now
an
opportunity
of
noting
.
<EOS>
Its
kindly
instincts
and
dumbaffection
appear
to
me
so
great
and
estimable
because
I
have
no
humanones
with
which
to
contrast
them
.
<EOS>
I
do
love
the
dog
,
for
I
have
nothingelse

<EOS>
”“Now
,
”
cried
Gray
,
“
by
hell—”“Hold
,
uncle
—
for
shame
!
”
<EOS>
said
Harry
.
<EOS>
“
Love
the

and
the

willlove
you

<EOS>
They
never
betray
their
masters
.
<EOS>
”A
<EOS>
livid
paleness
came
across
Gray
’s
face
as
he
held
by
the
table
,
<EOS>
andgasped,—“Wh
—
what
—
do
—
you
mean
by
that?”“I
say
,
”
repeated
Harry
,
“
that
dogs
never

”“Never
<EOS>
betray

their

”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
Oh
,
that
is
what
youmean
—
that
is
all?”“Nay
,
uncle
,
what
do
you
mean
?
”
said
the
boy
,
surprised
at
the
awfuland
convulsive
agitation
of
Gray
.
<EOS>
“Mean
?
”
echoed
Gray—“What
can
I
mean
—
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
—
I
have
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
Recollect
—
<EOS>
Iknow
I

nothing

I
am
quite
sure

<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
know
not
the
cause
of
your
agitation
,
”
remarked
Harry
;
“
but
I
cannothave
my
poor
hound
injured

<EOS>
”“He
<EOS>
shall
die

”
<EOS>
shrieked
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
Heaven
nor
hell
shall
not
save
him
.
<EOS>
Youdon’t
know
how
or
why
,
but
you
have
sealed
his
fate

<EOS>
”“I
sealed
his
fate?”“Yes
,
you
—
you
,
by
your
prating
of
his
virtues
.
”“Impossible

uncle
;
you

<EOS>
This
noble

a

<EOS>
Dogs

”“Cease

”
<EOS>
cried
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
Do
you
want
to
drive
me
mad?”“Mad

uncle
,
because
dogs
are
faithful?”“No

<EOS>
Stand

<EOS>
”“I

not

<EOS>
Joy

defend
yourself
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
dog
uttered
a
low
growl
,
and
showed
rather
a
formidable
row
ofglistening
teeth
.
<EOS>
“Harry
,
”
said
Gray
,
“
<EOS>
do
you
know
who
and
what
you
are?”A
<EOS>
mantling
flush
<EOS>
colour
crimsoned
the
pale
brow
of
the
boy
,
as
he
said,—“You
have
told

<EOS>
”“You
know
your
utter
dependence

upon

<EOS>
”“You

<EOS>
”“You

said
the

,
proudly
.
<EOS>
“So
<EOS>
that
,
although
I
am

”
added
Gray
,
“

by

<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
boy
was
silent
,
and
Gray
continued,—“Stand
aside
,
then
,
and
baulk
me
not
in
such
a

as
the

<EOS>
”“No

”
cried
Harry
;
“
were
you
ten
times

<EOS>

<EOS>
clutched
his
hands
convulsively
,
as
if
he
felt
an
inclination
torush
upon
the
weak
,
defenceless
boy
,
and
crush
him
in
his
fury
.
<EOS>
He
,
however
,
restrained
himself
,
and
said,—“You
are
mad
—
quite
mad
.
<EOS>
How
can
you
hope
for
a
moment
to
resist
mywill?”“Uncle
,
”
said
the
boy
,
“
I
have
done
much

<EOS>
”“What

<EOS>
cried
Gray
eagerly
.
<EOS>
“Touch

I

flyfrom

shrieking
for

”“You

<EOS>
”“And
what

<EOS>
cried
Gray
;
“

<EOS>
Go
to

<EOS>
”“God

said
the

<EOS>
“
Come

<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
dog
followed
closely
upon
the
heels
of
the
boy
as
he
slowly
leftthe
room
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
quite
gone
,
Gray
lit
a
lamp
,
and
withoutspeaking
,
stole
into
the
passage
and
listened
attentively
.
<EOS>
Thenreturning
,
he
threw
himself
into
the
chair
in
which
the
boy
had
beensitting
,
and
commenced
a
murmuring
colloquy
with
himself
.
<EOS>
“The
sight
of
this
young
thing

”
he
said
,
“
always
freezes

Oh

CHAPTER
XVII.“The
Chequers
,
”
at
<EOS>
Westminster.—Britton
’s
Notions
of
Greatness.—“Whenthe
Wine
is
<EOS>
In
,
the
Wit
is
Out
.
”Jacob
<EOS>
Gray
was
quite
right
when
he
averred
that
the
smith
was
on
histrack
like
a
blood
-
hound
.
<EOS>
Britton
had
entered
heartily
into
the
schemeof
destroying
Gray
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
that
he
particularly
wished
toappropriate
to
himself
Gray
<EOS>
’s
portion
of
what
was
wrung
from
the
fearsof
Learmont
,
nor
did
he
particularly
see
or
care
for
the
destruction
ofGray
as
a
matter
of
policy
;
but
he
hated
him
personally
.
<EOS>
His
assumptionof
superior
address
was
especially
annoying
to
Britton
.
<EOS>
He
felt
thatGray
was
more
than
a
match
for
him
in
cunning
,
and
moreover
,
hedespised
him
for
the
cowardice
of
his
character
,
and
over
his
cupsthought
it
would
be
a
rare
thing
to
outwit
Jacob
Gray
,
which
,
translated
,
meant
kill
him
with
safety
—
not
personal
safety
in
the
actof
killing
,
but
safety
from
the
consequences
of
Gray
’s
extremeprecautionary
measures
for
his
own
preservation
.
<EOS>
The
smith
familiarised
himself
thus
with
the
thought
of
overcoming
thewily
Jacob
,
and
his
ferocious
fancy
indulged
itself
in
glutting
oversome
violent
and
bloody
death
for
the
man
who
had
presumed
to
assumegreater
address
than
he
.
<EOS>
By
some
curious
train
of
thought
,
too
,
thesmith
always
considered
himself
as
personally
injured
by
Gray
,
becausethe
latter
,
when
he
visited
him
at
the
smithy
,
had
so
fenced
himselfround
with
precautions
,
that
he
,
Britton
could
not
but
see
the
extremeimpolicy
of
knocking
him
on
the
head
with
his
forge
hammer
,
which
hehad
fully
resolved
to
do
whenever
he
had
an
opportunity
.
<EOS>
“Curse
him
!
”
<EOS>
Britton
would
growl
over
his
cups
,
“
I
will
have
his
lifeyet
.
<EOS>
Despite
his
cunning
I
will
have
his
life!”Britten
’s
scheme
of
operations
was
more
in
accordance
with
his
violentnature
than
any
which
Learmont
could
suggest
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
to
dog
Grayto
his
house
,
and
then
finding
some
means
of
admittance
,
either
wringfrom
his
fears
<EOS>
the
secret
of
where
he
kept
the
written
confession
hetalked
so
much
of
,
and
then
kill
him
;
or
should
that
plan
not
succeed
,
take
his
life
first
,
and
trust
to
his
powers
of
search
to
find
thedangerous
document
somewhere
in
his
abode
.
<EOS>
With
this
project
in
view
,
Britton
had
kept
an
eye
on
the
house
ofLearmont
,
and
followed
Gray
upon
the
river
,
as
we
have
seen
.
<EOS>
Great
was
the
rage
of
the
smith
at
the
utter
failure
of
this
,
his
firstattempt
to
ferret
out
the
hiding
-
place
of
Master
Gray
,
which
he
beganto
think
was
by
no
means
<EOS>
so
easy
a
job
as
he
had
supposed
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
should
Gray
pursue
the
plan
he
had
commenced
so
successfully
,
ofturning
upon
his
pursuer
,
the
scheme
would
be
fraught
with
the
greatestdifficulties
.
<EOS>
Moreover
the
smith
could
not
conceal
from
himself
that
byhis
unsuccessful
attempt
he
had
put
Gray
upon
his
guard
,
which
was
thevery
last
thing
he
should
have
risked
.
<EOS>
All
these
reflections
put
thesmith
in
no
very
pleasant
mood
,
when
he
repaired
from
the
water
-
side
to“The
Chequers
”
and
it
was
not
until
he
had
quaffed
at
two
draughts
ahuge
tankard
of
humming
ale
that
he
felt
his
equanimity
at
all
restored
.
<EOS>
He
then
began
to
swear
awfully
,
which
unburdened
his
mind
very
much
,
and
calling
for
another
tankard
,
he
shouted—“Landlord
,
come
hither
,
man
.
<EOS>
Dip
your
red
nose
in
the
tankard
.
<EOS>
”The
landlord
,
nothing
loth
,
took
a
hearty
draught
of
the
ale
,
afterwhich
<EOS>
he
smacked
his
lips
with
a
knowing
air
,
and
looking
intently
at
afly
-
cage
that
hung
from
the
ceiling
he
said
in
an
abstracted
<EOS>
tone,—“This
ale
is
splendid
—
glorious
.
<EOS>
I
must
keep
it
for
the
worshipfulMaster
Britton
’s
<EOS>
own
drinking
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
do
it
—
and
I
will
do
it
.
<EOS>
”“What
<EOS>
are
you
muttering
about
?
”
<EOS>
roared
the
smith
,
taking
up
theempty
-
flagon
,
and
bestowing
a
hard
rap
with
it
on
the
landlord
’s
head
.
<EOS>
“Bless
us
!
”
cried
the
host
,

in

thought

<EOS>
”“Deep
<EOS>

,
you

”
cried
Britton
.
<EOS>
“
You
’ll
keep
the
ale
for
me
,
willyou?”Again
the
flagon
touched
not
over
gently
the
landlord
’s
head
,
and
thesmith
was
mightily
amused
at
the
wry
faces
he
made
.
<EOS>
“Come
—
come
,
sit
down
,
man
,
”
he
cried
,
“
and
do
n’t
try
to
deceive
me;you’ll
keep
the
ale
for
me
,
will
you?”“In
<EOS>
a
moment
I
will
attend
your
worship
,
”
said
the
landlord
,
bustlingoff
as
some
one
knocked
furiously
at
the
little
wooden
bar
.
<EOS>
“Now
,
by
the
Holy
Well
of
Penseross
,
which
they
say
was
pure
Rhenishwine
,
”
muttered
the
landlord
,
when
he
was
out
of
hearing
of
the
smith,“I
could
see
that
rascal
hung
with
as
much
pleasure
as
—
as
—
as—”“Timothy
!
”
<EOS>
screamed
a
female
voice
at
this
moment
,
which
could
belikened
to
nothing
but
a
tin
trumpet
with
a
bad
cold—“Timothy
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
”“My
wife
!
”
said
the
landlord
,
finishing
the
sentence
and
rushing
intothe
bar
with
a
“
here
my
love,—here
I
am
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
abundance
of
money
possessed
by
Britton
made
him
perfectly
welcomeat
“
The
Chequers
,
”
notwithstanding
the
rough
nature
of
many
of
hispractical
jokes
.
<EOS>
The
landlord
lived
in
the
full
expectation
of
findingsome
day
that
the
smith
’s
funds
were
exhausted
,
and
his
object
was
tokeep
him
in
good
humour
,
and
put
up
with
him
so
long
and
no
longer
,
forthe
wiseacres
at
“
The
Chequers
”
had
made
up
their
minds
that
the
goldwhich
Britton
spent
so
freely
was
the
produce
of
some
great
robbery
,
and
their
only
surprise
from
day
to
day
was
that
they
did
not
hear
ahue
and
cry
after
Britton
,
with
an
accurate
description
of
him
appendedto
it
.
<EOS>
The
smith
now
took
up
the
massive
poker
appertaining
and
belonging
tothe
fire
-
side
of
“
The
Chequers
,
”
and
commenced
beating
upon
one
of
theoaken
tables
so
lustily
that
the
landlord
rushed
into
the
room
in
wildfright
and
amazement
,
crying
,
“
The
saints
preserve
us
,
<EOS>
Master
Britton!What
does
your
worship
want?”“Sit
down
,
”
roared
the
smith
.
<EOS>
“
Hurrah
!
<EOS>
I
’m
going
to
treat
everybody
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
landlord
lifted
up
his
hands
and
exclaimed,—“Worshipful
Master
Britton
,
my
humble
opinion
is
of
very
little
moment
.
<EOS>
”“That
<EOS>
’s
true
,
”
said
Britton
.
<EOS>
“But
<EOS>
I
assert
,
”
continued
the
landlord
,
“
that
you
ought
to
have
been
aking
.
<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
how
do
you
know
<EOS>
I
ar’nt
a
king
,
eh
,
numskull
?
”
cried
the
smith
.
<EOS>
This
was
certainly
a
poser
to
the
politic
landlord
,
and
he
onlymuttered
that
he
ventured
to
suppose
he
was
not
.
<EOS>
“Then
<EOS>
you
’re
a
fool
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Britton
,
to
the
great
amusement
of
thecompany
,
who
had
pricked
up
their
ears
wonderfully
since
Button
hadtalked
of
a
general
treat
.
<EOS>
“The
landlord
’s
a
fool
!
”
<EOS>
repeated
the
smith
,
looking
round
the
roomwith
a
half
-
intoxicated
stare
.
<EOS>
“So
<EOS>
he
is
,
”
cried
several
voices
.
<EOS>
“No
<EOS>
he
ai
n’t
,
”
roared
Britton
.
<EOS>
“N
<EOS>
—
n
—
not
quite
a
fool
,
”
said
a
little
punchy
man
,
with
a
pipe
in
hismouth
.
<EOS>
“But
<EOS>
you
are
!
”
<EOS>
added
Britton
,
which
at
once
silenced
the
little
punchyman
,
who
very
wisely
made
no
reply
whatever
.
<EOS>
After
the
applause
of
this
sally
had
subsided
,
the
landlord
ventured
tosuggest
that
mugs
of
spiced
canary
all
round
would
not
be
amiss
tobegin
the
evening
with
.
<EOS>
This
suggestion
met
with
universal
approval
,
and
Britton
waving
hishand
,
consented
whereupon
<EOS>
the
landlord
heaved
a
deep
sigh
,
andremarked
,
that
if
all
the
world
was
like
him
,
the
worshipful
MasterBritton
,
what
a
different
world
it
would
be
to
what
it
really
was
.
<EOS>
“Off
with
,
you
,
”
shouted
Britton
.
<EOS>
“
The
canary
—
the
canary
,
and
we’llhave
a
song
.
<EOS>
I
’ve
got
a
toast
,
too
,
to
propose
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
canary
was
not
long
in
appearing
,
and
Britton
rising
,
proposed
as
atoast,—“Damnation
for
Jacob
Gray!”The
landlord
<EOS>
looked
aghast
,
and
the
guests
looked
aghast
,
till
thepunchy
man
volunteered
his
opinion
in
the
following
terms,—“Gentlemen
,
we
do
n’t
know
Jacob
Gray
,
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
<EOS>
he
’s
<EOS>
avery
bad

<EOS>
Master

allround
,
and
,
consequently
,
<EOS>
it
’s
my
humble
opinion
<EOS>
it
must
be
right
.
<EOS>
”The
topers
looked
at
each
other
in
amazement
at
this
splendid
piece
ofreasoning
;
and
one
remarked
that
he
,
the
punchy
man
,
was
the
person
toget
over
a
knotty
pointy
which
was
universally
responded
to
in
theaffirmative
,
and
the
toast
was
drunk
with
acclamation
.
<EOS>
“A
song
,
”
cried
Britton—“a
song
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
landlord
looked
imploringly
round
him
for
some
one
to
sing
,
but
noone
seemed
inclined
,
therefore
he
said,—“The
worshipful
Master
Britton
calls
for
a
song
,
and
there
must
be
asong
.
<EOS>
”“Of
course
,
”
cried
Britton
,
“
and
you
must
sing
it
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
landlord
hemmed
thrice
,
and
after
taking
a
deep
draught
of
thecanary
,
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
fly
-
cage
hanging
from
the
ceiling
,
andchaunted
the
following
Bacchanalian
strains,—“Care
mantles
not
in
brimming

It

not
enter

the

there
’s
nought

Without

grim
despair

<EOS>
“Hurrah

shuns
<EOS>
the
wine

boys
—
for
why?Because
<EOS>
its
blushing
hueForbids
the

to
enter
there

Lest

be
lost

<EOS>
“Hurrah

drink

and
let
the
gushing
streamOf

boil
through

While
sober

And
find

<EOS>
“Hurrah

who

ever
breed
a

For
when
the

o’er

We
drink

<EOS>
“Hurrah

tell
us
that
when

the

has
gone
away

Our

will
beat

Nor

<EOS>
“Hurrah

cried
Britton

“
That

<EOS>
”“Very

cried
everybody

“Hurrah

shouted
the

an

dropped

CHAPTER
XVIII.The
<EOS>
Lone
Max.—The
Voice
of
Conscience
.
<EOS>
Alone
,
and
still
,
as
a
sculptured
image
,
sat
the
Squire
Learmont
,
inone
of
his
stately
halls
.
<EOS>
He
was
surrounded
by
magnificence
,
but
he
wasalone
.
<EOS>
The
closely
-
fitting
easements
admitted
,
but
in
subdued
murmurs
,
the
various
voices
of
the
city
,
but
there
was
no
one
,
save
himself
,
toenjoy
the
luxury
of
the
calm
that
reigned
in
that
gilt
and
gaudysaloon
.
<EOS>
The
choicest
hangings
depended
from
the
walls
,
half
concealing
,
yet
rendering
more
effective
,
the
glowing
paintings
that
were
hung
inthe
most
favourable
lights
;
but
Learmont
was
alone
.
<EOS>
A
chandelier
,
shaded
by
coloured
glasses
,
shed
a
sweet
and
chastened
light
upon
everyarticle
in
that
costly
room
,
but
who
was
there
to
admire
,
to
gaze
inrapture
upon
the
splendour
of
that
magical
scene
?
<EOS>
Learmont
was
alone
,
and
the
deep
sense
of
his
utter
loneliness
,
crept
across
him
with
achilling
influence
that
seemed
to
penetrate
even
to
the
very
marrow
inhis
bones
.
<EOS>
How
many
,
in
the
selfish
pride
of
their
hearts
,
suppose
it
possible
toextract
joy
from
merely
selfish
pleasures
!
<EOS>
How
many
have
cast
from
themall
the
endearing
associations
of
kindred
and
fellowship
to
wrapthemselves
up
,
as
it
were
,
in
their
own
hearts
that
they
might
share
nodelight
with
another
,
imagining
that
they
might
,
by
such
a
process
,
concentrate
in
themselves
all
the
diffused
happiness
of
many
.
<EOS>
This
hasbeen
the
dreary
delusions
of
many
,
but
a
time
has
come
when
all
haveawakened
to
the
truth
that
man
must
borrow
his
greatest
joy
from
thereflected
happiness
of
others
.
<EOS>
To
such
a
mind
as
Learmont
’s
,
thisimmutable
and
holy
truth
was
long
in
coming
,
but
now
as
he
sat
alone
inhis
princely
hall
;
surrounded
with
light
and
splendour
,
he
would
havefelt
relieved
<EOS>
could
he
have
turned
to
any
one
upon
whose
countenance
hecould
have
read
with
pleasure
and
delight
—
aye
<EOS>
,
the
veriest
beggar
thatever
asked
for
alms
of
rich
and
proud
,
would
,
at
that
moment
,
have
beenwelcome
,
for
Learmont
’s
very
heart
felt
lonely
and
desolate
.
<EOS>
Did
heenjoy
the
exquisite
covering
of
that
lofty
ceiling
?
<EOS>
Did
he
exult
overthe
rich
gilding
which
lay
like
plates
of
massive
gold
on
the
elaboratecornices
?
<EOS>
Did
the
soft
,
beautiful
light
,
which
seemed
in
its
rareexcellence
to
belong
to
the
sunrise
of
a
better
world
,
fall
upon
hisheart
with
joyful
brilliancy
?
<EOS>
Alas
,
no
!
<EOS>
He
was
alone
!
<EOS>
The
first
proudflush
of
gratified
pride
,
in
having
created
and
being
the
master
of
allthis
,
had
died
away
and
left
behind
it
<EOS>
but
a
sensation
of
lonelinessand
desolation
of
spirit
,
such
as
he
had
never
before
experienced
.
<EOS>
In
vain
the
Lord
of
Learmont
battled
with
his
own
feelings
.
<EOS>
They
wouldnot
be
resisted
;
and
,
at
length
,
half
mad
with
the
mental
struggle
hewas
enduring
,
he
rose
from
the
chair
on
which
he
had
been
sitting
andstood
up
to
his
full
height
,
in
the
centre
of
the
saloon
,
while
onedeep
groan
burst
from
his
heart
,
sounding
strangely
awful
in
the
midstof
<EOS>
all
that
glitter
and
display
.
<EOS>
Then
his
dark
eye
flashed
fire
,
and
he
made
a
great
effort
to
rousehimself
from
the
deep
dejection
that
had
stolen
over
him
.
<EOS>
“What
have
I
striven
for
?
”
<EOS>
he
cried
.
<EOS>
“
What
dipped
my
hands
in
bloodfor
,
but
for
all
this
?
<EOS>
This
pride
of
wealth
—
this
glory
ofmagnificence
—
and
does
it
now
pall
upon
my
senses
?
<EOS>
Can
I
not
enjoy
whatI
have
striven
so
hard
to
obtain
?
<EOS>
Away
,
vain
shadows
of
remorse
—
born
insuperstition
,
and
,
fostered
by
prejudice
—
away
<EOS>
—
I
will
—
I
must
enjoy
whatI
<EOS>
have
wasted
the
better
part
of
life
to
obtain

<EOS>
My
gilded
saloons
,
Ilove
you
—
my
house
—
my
retinue
—
my
jewels
<EOS>
—
all
are
what
men
struggle
for
,
even
to
the
grave
’s
<EOS>
brink
,
because
the
universal
opinion
of
mankind
hasproclaimed
,
that
to
have
these
things
is
to
have
the
means
ofhappiness
.
<EOS>
I
have
them
;
and
yet
what
serpent
is
it
that
now
gnaws
at
myheart
,
and
forbids
the
enjoyment
of
what
is
mine
own
?
<EOS>
There
is
,
perhaps
,
too
much
silence
in
my
glorious
house
.
<EOS>
I
must
fill
my
saloonswith
the
young
and
the
beautiful
.
<EOS>
I
must
have
joy
reflected
on
my
ownface
from
the
sparkling
eyes
of
beauty
.
<EOS>
I
—
I
will
not
be
alone!—no
—
no
.
<EOS>
Iwill
be
seldom
alone
!
’
<EOS>
Tis
the
silence
of
this
spacious
hall
has
bredand
nursed
gloomy
fancies
in
my
brains
.
<EOS>
I
was
foolish
to
sithere
—
because
I
was
alone
.
<EOS>
”His
<EOS>
voice
sounded
hollow
and
distinct
in
the
large
space
around
him
,
and
the
word
“
alone
”
seemed
to
catch
some
strange
echo
in
the
saloon
,
and
to
be
whispered
back
,
to
him
from
the
high
ceiling
,
with
a
mournfultone
.
<EOS>
Squire
Learmont
paused
,
and
a
sneer
curled
his
lips
,
as
he
said,“Now
,
were
I
weak
and
superstitious
,
how
well
could
busy
fancy
peoplethis
large
space
with
grinning
gliding
shapes
,
such
as
haunt
ordinarymen
and
drive
their
weak
brains
to
distraction
.
<EOS>
I
hear
yon
echo
,
but
Iwill
not
be
alone
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
Ha
!
’
<EOS>
Tis
your
concave
roof
that
throws
back
mywords
.
<EOS>
Now
if
,
as
I
say
,
I
were
superstitious
—
but
I
am
not
.
<EOS>
”Even
<EOS>
as
he
spoke
,
he
repeatedly
turned
to
look
behind
,
and
it
wasevident
that
the
guilty
man
was
battling
with
his
fears
.
<EOS>
“This
hall
,
”
he
continued
,
“
is
very
large
—
and
—
and
cold
withal
.
<EOS>
I
willmake
some
smaller
room
suffice
me
.
”He
<EOS>
rang
for
a
domestic
,
and
,
in
spite
of
himself
,
he
could
not
helpaverring
to
his
own
heart
<EOS>
,
that
it
was
a
relief
to
see
the
face
of
ahuman
being
in
his
magnificent
solitude
.
<EOS>
“Light
up
the
small
room
with
the
yellow
hanging
,
”
said
Learmont
,
“
Iwill
sit
there
.
<EOS>
”The
servant
bowed
and
retired
.
<EOS>
“Yes
,
”
continued
Learmont
,
in
a
low
tone
,
as
he
seated
himself
in
achair
,
the
back
of
which
touched
the
wall
.
<EOS>
“
A
smaller
room
to
sit
in
ismore
agreeable
and
much
warmer
than
this
saloon
.
”
<EOS>
He
would
not
own
tohimself
that
the
large
space
around
him
had
frightened
him
,
and
that
hewas
really
trembling
with
a
terror
of
<EOS>
,
he
knew
not
what
—
such
an
awfulterror
as
commonly
creeps
over
the
hearts
of
the
guilty
in
solitudes
.
<EOS>
In
a
very
few
moments
the
servant
returned
and
announced
the
smallerroom
as
ready
for
his
master
’s
reception
.
<EOS>
Then
preceding
him
,
with
two
wax
lights
,
he
showed
the
trembling
squireinto
a
room
of
about
one
-
third
of
the
size
of
the
saloon
,
and
which
wasfurnished
more
plainly
,
but
quite
as
richly
as
regarded
the
costlynature
of
its
hangings
and
various
appointments
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
let
the
innocent

heart
and
single

purpose
lift
their
eyes
toHeaven
,
and
thank
it
for
their

Let

their
deepest

,
to

to

onedeed
of

lie
down
in

repose
,
for
they
are
rich
beyond
thewealth
of

—
powerful
beyond
the
power
of
the
mightiestconquerors
—
happy
beyond
any
happiness
that
this
world
can
afford
,
asthe
price
of
that
peace
of

,
which
so
many

<EOS>
It
was
not
the
extent
of
his
saloon
,
that
had
come
across
the
soul
ofthe
crime
-
steeped
Learmont
,
with
a
shuddering
horror
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
thathis
voice
echoed
in
his
lofty
house
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
undying
worm
,
conscience
;
that
takes
no
rest
,
knows
no
peace
,
but
will
be
heard
amidthe
din
of
battle
—
the
hilarity
of
the
banquet
—
that
will
float
upon
thewine
-
cup
—
mingle
with
every
strain
of
noise
,
and
make
a
hell
of
thehuman
heart
more
maddening
than
the
wildest
fanatic

promise

<EOS>
Learmont
could
not
sit
—
he
could
not
rest
—
the
air
around
him
seemedthick
and
heavy
—
his
first
impulse
was
to
ring
for
more
lights
,
and
morewere
brought
—
more
and
more
,
until
the
apartment
was
one
blaze
ofilluminations
;
but
all
was
in
vain
,
and
just
before
the
midnight
hoursounded
from
the
various
churches
,
the
lord
of
all
the
beauty
andmagnificence
of
that
costly
mansion
seized
a
hat
and
cloak
,
and
rushedinto
the
streets
to
seek
relief
by
violent
exercise
from
the
agony
thattortured
him
.
<EOS>
Without
aim
or
object
,
save
the
one
of
endeavouring
,
by
sheer
bodilyfatigue
,
to
seek
repose
for
the
overwrought
mind
,
Learmont
walkedonwards
through
the
various
streets
that
happened
to
present
themselvesat
convenient
junctures
to
his
notice
,
and
as
he
walked
with
a
quickstep
,
he
muttered
to
himself
the
anxious
reasoning
that
was
crossinghis
fevered
brain
.
<EOS>
“I
will
never
be
alone
!
”
<EOS>
he
muttered
:
“
never
—
never
.
<EOS>
Why
should
I
bealone?—I
who
am
revelling
in
wealth
?
<EOS>
From
this
moment
I
resolve
to
crammy
saloons
.
<EOS>
The
brilliant
decorations
of
my
home
shall
be
admired
byall
;
I
will
move
amidst
a
throng
of
youth
,
beauty
,
and

,
as
thepresiding

of
a
place
which
shall
be
little
short
of
a

of

and

.
<EOS>
I
—
I
will
intrigue
with
theintriguing
—
quaff
goblets
of

with
the
voluptuous
.
<EOS>
Ha

<EOS>
Ha!—Iwill
lead
a
life
of

that
shall
leave
no

for

<EOS>
Iwill
have
pleasure
after
pleasure
—
excitement
after
excitement
,
succeeding
each
other
with
such
rapidity
that
they
shall
onlyoccasionally
cease
when
the
wearied
frame
calls
loudly
for
repose
,
thatit
may
awaken
with
renovated
strength
to
undergo
a
routine
of
newpleasure!—I
will
never
be
alone!”He
walked
on
now
for
many
minutes
,
only
now
and
then
muttering
thewords
“
Never
alone
!
”
<EOS>
Then
a
new
train
of
thought
seemed
to
come
acrosshis
mind
,
and
he
whispered:—“These
two
men
,
this
Britton
and
the
crafty
Gray
!
<EOS>
They
,
indeed
,
arethorns
among
the
flowers
with
which
I
would
surround
myself
.
<EOS>
If
eithercould
but
safely
destroy
the
other
,
I
could
then
find
an
opportunity
ofgetting
rid
of
the
survivor
.
<EOS>
My
deepest
hatred
light
on
Gray
!
<EOS>
May
thecurses
—
pshaw
!
<EOS>
What
hurts
it
that
I
curse
him?—I
<EOS>
must
have
his
blood!’Tis
he
,
and
he
only
,
who
by
his
craft
preserves
his
own
life
,
andteaches
Britton
how
to
preserve
his
.
<EOS>
What
devil
whispered
to
thevillain
to
write
a
confession
of
his
crimes
for
his
own
preservation?Time
was
when
a
master
-
spirit
such
as
mine
could
with
small
pains
ridhimself
of
the
base
lowly
tools
with
which
he
built
his
fortune
and
hisfame
.
<EOS>
The
grave
closed
over
the
hateful
secrets
that
embittered
theroad
to
power
and
greatness
,
leaving
that
power
and
greatness
,
whenonce
achieved
,
undermined
by
the
black
shadows
of
the
past
.
<EOS>
Unboundedwealth
is
at
my
command
—
a
crouching
herd
at
my
feet
,
because
I
am
themaster
of
the
yellow
dross
for
which
mankind
will
barter
Heaven!And
—
<EOS>
and
yet
I
—
<EOS>
even
I
am
to
be
haunted
by
two
ruffians
,
who
with
asubtlety
undreamt
of
,
have
hedged
themselves
in
with
precautions
.
<EOS>
Byhell
,
I
will
not
—
cannot
bear
it!—I’ll
pluck
these
papers
from

if
they
should
hide
them
there!—I
will
no
longer
be
scaredby
<EOS>
this
awful
phantom
of
fear
that
shadows
my
heart
<EOS>
—
they
shall
die!”How
many
,
<EOS>
in
the
selfish
pride
of
their
hearts
,
suppose
it
possible
toextract
joy
from
merely
selfish
pleasures
!
<EOS>
How
many
have
cast
fromthem
,
all
the
endearing
associations
of
kindred
and
fellowship
to
wrapthemselves
up
,
as
it
were
,
in
their
own
hearts
that
they
might
share
nodelight
with
another
,
imagining
that
they
might
,
by
such
a
process
,
concentrate
in
themselves
all
the
diffused
happiness
of
many
.
<EOS>
This
hasbeen
the
dreary
delusions
of
many
,
but
a
time
has
come
when
all
haveawakened
to
the
truth
that
man
must
borrow
his
greatest
joy
from
thereflected
happiness
of
others
.
<EOS>
To
such
a
mind
as
Learmont
’s
,
thisimmutable
and
holy
truth
was
long
in
coming
,
but
now
as
he
sat
alone
inhis
princely
hall
;
surrounded
with
light
and
splendour
,
he
would
havefelt
relieved
<EOS>
could
he
have
turned
to
any
one
upon
whose
countenance
hecould
have
read
with
pleasure
and
delight
—
aye
<EOS>
,
the
veriest
beggar
thatever
asked
for
alms
of
rich
and
proud
,
would
,
at
that
moment
,
have
beenwelcome
,
for
Learmont
’s
very
heart
felt
lonely
and
desolate
.
<EOS>
Did
heenjoy
the
exquisite
covering
of
that
lofty
ceiling
?
<EOS>
Did
he
exult
overthe
rich
gilding
which
lay
like
plates
of
massive
gold
on
the
elaboratecornices
?
<EOS>
Did
the
soft
,
beautiful
light
,
which
seemed
in
its
rareexcellence
to
belong
to
the
sunrise
of
a
better
world
,
fall
upon
hisheart
with
joyful
brilliancy
?
<EOS>
Alas
,
no
!
<EOS>
he
was
alone
!
<EOS>
the
first
proudflush
of
gratified
pride
,
in
having
created
and
being
the
master
of
allthis
,
had
died
away
and
left
behind
it
<EOS>
but
a
sensation
of
lonelinessand
desolation
of
spirit
,
such
as
he
had
never
before
experienced
.
<EOS>
In
vain
the
Lord
of
Learmont
battled
with
his
own
feelings
.
<EOS>
They
wouldnot
be
resisted
;
and
,
at
length
,
half
mad
with
the
mental
struggle
hewas
enduring
,
he
rose
from
the
chair
on
which
he
had
been
sitting
andstood
up
to
his
full
height
,
in
the
centre
of
the
saloon
,
while
onedeep
groan
burst
from
his
heart
,
sounding
strangely
awful
in
the
midstof
<EOS>
all
that
glitter
and
display
.
<EOS>
Then
his
dark
eye
flashed
fire
,
and
he
made
a
great
effort
to
rousehimself
from
the
deep
dejection
that
had
stolen
over
him
.
<EOS>
“What
have
I
striven
for
?
”
<EOS>
he
cried
.
<EOS>
“
What
dipped
my
hands
in
bloodfor
,
but
for
all
this
?
<EOS>
This
pride
of
wealth
—
this
glory
ofmagnificence
—
and
does
it
now
pall
upon
my
senses
?
<EOS>
Can
I
not
enjoy
whatI
have
striven
so
hard
to
obtain
?
<EOS>
Away
,
vain
shadows
of
remorse
—
born
insuperstition
,
and
,
fostered
by
prejudice
—
away
<EOS>
—
I
will
—
I
must
enjoy
whatI
<EOS>
have
wasted
the
better
part
of
life
to
obtain
.
<EOS>
My
gilded
saloons
,
Ilove
you
—
my
house
—
<EOS>
my
retinue.—my
jewels
—
all
are
what
men
struggle
for
,
even
to
the
grave
’s
brink
,
because
the
universal
opinion
of
mankind
hasproclaimed
,
that
to
have
these
things
is
to
have
the
means
ofhappiness
.
<EOS>
I
have
them
;
and
yet
what
serpent
is
it
that
now
gnaws
at
myheart
,
and
forbids
the
enjoyment
of
what
is
mine
own
?
<EOS>
There
is
,
perhaps
,
too
much
silence
in
my
glorious
house
.
<EOS>
I
must
fill
my
saloonswith
the
young
and
the
beautiful
.
<EOS>
I
must
have
joy
reflected
on
my
ownface
from
the
sparkling
eyes
of
beauty
.
<EOS>
I
—
I
will
not
be
alone!—no
—
no
.
<EOS>
Iwill
be
seldom
alone
!
’
<EOS>
tis
the
silence
of
this
spacious
hall
<EOS>
has
bredand
nursed
gloomy
fancies
in
my
brains
.
<EOS>
I
was
foolish
to
sithere
—
because
I
was
alone
.
<EOS>
”His
<EOS>
voice
sounded
hollow
and
distinct
in
the
large
space
around
him
,
and
the
word
“
alone
”
seemed
to
catch
some
strange
echo
in
the
saloon
,
and
to
be
whispered
back
,
to
him
from
the
high
ceiling
,
with
a
mournfultone
.
<EOS>
Squire
Learmont
paused
,
and
a
sneer
curled
his
lips
,
as
he
said,“Now
,
were
I
weak
and
superstitious
,
how
well
could
busy
fancy
peoplethis
large
space
with
grinning
gliding
shapes
,
such
as
haunt
ordinarymen
and
drive
their
weak
brains
to
distraction
.
<EOS>
I
hear
yon
echo
,
but
Iwill
not
be
alone
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
Ha
!
’
<EOS>
Tis
your
concave
roof
that
throws
back
mywords
.
<EOS>
Now
if
,
as
I
say
,
I
were
superstitious
—
but
I
am
not
.
<EOS>
”Even
<EOS>
as
he
spoke
,
he
repeatedly
turned
to
look
behind
,
and
it
wasevident
that
the
guilty
man
was
battling
with
his
fears
.
<EOS>
“This
hall
,
”
he
continued
,
“
is
very
large
—
and
—
and
cold
withal
.
<EOS>
I
willmake
some
smaller
room
suffice
me
.
”He
<EOS>
rang
for
a
domestic
,
and
,
in
spite
of
himself
,
he
could
not
helpaverring
to
his
own
heart
<EOS>
,
that
it
was
a
relief
to
see
the
face
of
ahuman
being
in
his
magnificent
solitude
.
<EOS>
“Light
up
the
small
room
with
the
yellow
hanging
,
”
said
Learmont
,
“
Iwill
sit
there
.
<EOS>
”The
servant
bowed
and
retired
.
<EOS>
“Yes
,
”
continued
Learmont
,
in
a
low
tone
,
as
he
seated
himself
in
achair
,
the
back
of
which
touched
the
wall
.
<EOS>
“
A
smaller
room
to
sit
in
ismore
agreeable
and
much
warmer
than
this
saloon
.
”
<EOS>
He
would
not
own
tohimself
that
the
large
space
around
him
had
frightened
him
,
and
that
hewas
really
trembling
with
a
terror
of
<EOS>
,
he
knew
not
what
—
such
an
awfulterror
as
commonly
creeps
over
the
hearts
of
the
guilty
in
solitudes
.
<EOS>
In
a
very
few
moments
the
servant
returned
and
announced
the
smallerroom
as
ready
for
his
master
’s
reception
.
<EOS>
Then
preceding
him
,
with
two
wax
lights

Adventure.—A
<EOS>
Discovery.—The
Haunted
House.—Exultation
,
and
aResolution
.
<EOS>
In
the
wild
excitement
of
his
passions
,
Learmont
had
walked
onwards
,
heedless
of
whither
he
was
going
,
and
now
that
he
had
in
some
measurefound
the
relief
he
sought
for
in
fatigue
,
he
glared
anxiously
round
tofind
if
possible
what
part
of
the
town
he
had
strayed
to
in
his
deepabstraction
.
<EOS>
The
night
was
very
dark
,
not
a
star
peeped
forth
from
heaven
to
lightwith
its
small
twinkling
lustre
the
massive
black
arch
of
thefirmament
.
<EOS>
No
moon
shed
its
silvery
radiance
on
the
gigantic
city;—adarkness
,
so
intense
that
sky
,
houses
<EOS>
,
trees,—all
seemed
merged
intoone
chaotic
mass
.
<EOS>
“Where
<EOS>
should
I
be
?
”
<EOS>
muttered
Learmont
;
“
I
must
have
walked
far
,
for
Iam
weary
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
Is
that
the
hour?”The
clock
of
St.
Paul
’s
struck
three
as
he
spoke
,
and
from
thedirection
of
the
sound
,
Learmont
guessed
that
he
was
somewheresouthward
of
that
edifice
.
<EOS>
“Some
chance
passenger
,
”
he
muttered
,
“
will
direct
me
to
Westminster;yet
<EOS>
I
hear
no
footfall
in
these
silent
streets
.
<EOS>
How
still
and
solemnnow
is
the
great
city
;
one
might
imagine
it
<EOS>
a
vast
cemetery
,
in
whichthe
dead
alone
dwelt
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
paced
slowly
down
a
long
straggling
street
,
and
his
own
footstepswere
the
only
sounds
that
disturbed
the
solemn
stillness
that
reignedaround
.
<EOS>
Learmont
walked
on
slowly
,
for
he
knew
not
<EOS>
but
he
might
be
in
somedangerous
quarter
of
the
city
,
and
his
suspicions
that
the
locality
inwhich
he
was
did
not
possess
any
great
claims
to
fashion
orrespectability
were
much
increased
by
a
door
suddenly
opening
in
ahouse
some
dozen
yards
in
advance
of
him
,
and
a
man
being
flung
from
itwith
considerable
force
into
the
centre
of
the
street
,
while
a
loudvoice
,
exclaimed:—“Go
to
the
devil
,
an
’
you
will
.
<EOS>
Are
we
to
sit
up
all
night
to
attend
toone
sot
?
<EOS>
No
,
that
will
never
suit
the
Old
Mitre
,
an
’
there
were
a
rounddozen
of
you
,
we
might
think
of
it
.
”“It
<EOS>
’s
d
—
damned
ill
-
usage
,
”
remonstrated
the
man
who
had
been
turned
outso
unceremoniously
from
what
appeared
to
Learmont
a
little
tavern
,
andthe
door
of
which
was
immediately
flung
close
,
and
barred
from
within
.
<EOS>
“That
<EOS>
’s
the
—
the
way
of
the
world
,
”
remarked
the
drunken
man
,
as
heslowly
gathered
himself
up
on
his
feet
,
and
shook
his
head
with
tipsygravity
.
<EOS>
“
There
’s
no
such
thing
as
a
consideration
in
the
world
,
andthe
street
even
is
turning
round
—
and
round
in
a
mostex
—
ex
—
extra
—
ordinary
manner
.
<EOS>
That
’s
how
I
never
can
get
homeprop
—
properly
.
<EOS>
The
streets
keep
a
-
moving
in
that
ex
—
ex
—
extraordinarymanner;—that
end
comes
round
to
this
end
—
and
that
’s
how
I
’m
led
astray
.
<EOS>
It
’s
too
bad
—
it
is
indeed
;
it
’s
enough
to
—
to
make
one
weep
,
it
is
.
<EOS>
Butno
matter
ex
—
ex
—
a
double
extraordinary
man
,
and
a
greatly
injuredcharacter
.
<EOS>
”The
drunkard
had
evidently
reached
the
sentimental
stage
ofintoxication
,
and
he
staggered
along
weeping
and
lamenting
alternately
.
<EOS>
“I
may
gather
from
this
sot
some
information
of
where
I
am
,
”
thoughtLearmont
,
and
in
an
instant
he
strided
after
the
reeling
man
.
<EOS>
When
he
reached
him
he
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
,
and
said,—“My
friend
,
can
you
tell
me
where
I
am?”“Eh?—’pon
<EOS>
my
w
—
w

word
,
that
’s
a
funny
question
.
<EOS>
Why

you
—
you’ve
justbeen
turned
out
of
the
Mitre
.
<EOS>
”“Pho
!
<EOS>
Pho

”
<EOS>
cried
Learmont
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
“
Can
you
tell
me
what
part
ofthe
town
<EOS>
we
are
in?”“The
o
—
open
air

of

”
replied
the
man
.
<EOS>
“
Hurrah

<EOS>
That
’s
myopinion

<EOS>
My

<EOS>
And
all
I

<EOS>
”“What

said
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“I’ll

<EOS>
I’ll
do

”“Do

what?”“Do

<EOS>
Come

<EOS>
You

<EOS>
How
very
ex

ex

extraordinary!”“Idiot
!
”
exclaimed
Learmont
,
striding
away
;
but
the
man
called
afterhim
,
and
his
voice
echoed
through
the
deserted
street
,
as
he
said,—“Don’t
be

offended

<EOS>
I
’ll
do

<EOS>
Ah

<EOS>

paused
in
astonishment
,
not
altogether
unmingled
with
dismay
,
at
these
words
<EOS>
and
he
was
by
the
man
<EOS>
’s
side
again
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
“You

<EOS>
“
he
said
.
<EOS>
“Yes

yes

replied

the

<EOS>
“
I
’ll
do

<EOS>
”“What
<EOS>
can
this
mean

”
<EOS>
thought
Learmont
<EOS>
;
then
he
said
,
aloud,—“Who
am
I
—
you
say
you
know
me?”“You
<EOS>
—
you
did
n’t
think
it

said
the
man
,
with
much
drunken
<EOS>
cunning;“but
<EOS>
I
watched

<EOS>
”“You
watched
me
home?”“Yes,—to

<EOS>
Do

Oh

<EOS>
said
Learmont

who
was
determined
to
humour

<EOS>
“Yes

sharp

jumped
again;and

tightly

“Ye

proposed

man
looked
in
the
countenance

as
well
as
the
darknesswould
permit
him
,
and
answered
,
not
without
evident
trepidation,—“Gray

<EOS>

Cautiously

”CHAPTER

XX.The
Guide.—The
Old
House.—The
Murder
.
<EOS>
Sheldon
continued
singing
snatches
of
rude
songs
,
and
staggeringonwards
,
while
Learmont
followed
closely
upon
his
heels
,
andjudiciously
kept
up
a
conversation
with
him
that
prevented
him
fromgiving
any
further
thought
on
the
object
of
his
present
undertaking
.
<EOS>
It
was
strictly
true
what
Sheldon
had
stated
.
<EOS>
After
landing
Jacob
Gray
,
he
had
left
his
boat
in
charge
of
one
of
the
idlers
who
are
alwaysplying
on
the
banks
of
the
river
,
and
cautiously
dogged
his
customerhome
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
circumstance
which
it
had
never
for
one
moment
enteredinto
even
Gray
’s
over
-
suspicious
imagination
to
conceive
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
as
hefelt
well
assured
,
scared
Britton
from
pursuing
him
for
that
time
atleast
;
and
he
fancied
himself
,
therefore
,
quite
free
.
<EOS>
Hence
was
it
thatthe
waterman
,
who
wished
to
know
something
more
of
the
man
who
had
madeto
him
a
proposal
amounting
to
murder
,
succeeded
in
so
successfullyfollowing
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
At
that
period
the
Thames
was
infested
with
the
worst
of
characters
,
and
scarcely
any
proposition
,
let
it
involve
what
measure
of
guilt
itmight
,
could
be
made
in
vain
to
many
of
the
desperadoes
who
wereostensibly
watermen
,
but
really
,
robbers
and
cut
-
throats
of
the
vilestdescription
.
<EOS>
That
Sheldon
was
a
man
not
tortured
with
many
virtuousscruples
,
the
reader
will
readily
conceive
;
but
he
did
shrink
from
thecold
-
blooded
murder
so
calmly
proposed
to
him
by
Gray
,
and
he
felt
wellinclined
to
sell
that
gentleman
to
justice
,
only
he
was
very
anxious
tohave
a
good
price
for
his
virtue
,
for
Master
Sheldon
was
fond
of
sack
,
doted
on
canary
,
and
idolised
all
manner
of
strong
drinks
;
so
that
agood
reward
in
gold
pieces
for
not
doing
a
decidedly
disagreeable
job
,
presented
itself
to
his
mind
in
lovely
and
agreeable
colours
.
<EOS>
So
elatedhad
he
been
with
the
bare
supposition
of
such
an
event
,
that
instead
ofgoing
back
to
the
stairs
at
which
he
had
left
his
wherry
,
he
hadrepaired
to
the
“
Mitre
,
”
and
tasted
so
many
different
enticing
anddelicious
compounds
,
that
,
as
the
reader
is
aware
,
the
calculating
andconsiderate
landlord
was
compelled
to
turn
him
out
at
three
o’clock
inthe
morning
,
because
,
being
only
one
drunkard
,
he
was
not
worthattending
to
any
longer
.
<EOS>
With
eager
steps
Learmont
followed
his
guide
till
they
came
to
therange
of
miserable
habitations
,
in
one
of
which
Jacob
Gray
hadconcealed
himself
and
his
precious
charge
.
<EOS>
“Ah
,
”
said
Learmont
,
“
I
begin
to
think
you
do
indeed
know
the
way
.
<EOS>
”“Know
<EOS>
the
way
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Sheldon—“I
could
find
it
blindfold
.
<EOS>
Come
on
,
I
—
<EOS>
I’ll
take
you
to
your
own
door
.
<EOS>
”“What
astonishing
acuteness
!
”
<EOS>
remarked
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“Yes
,
“
said
Sheldon
,
wonderfully
flattered
,
“
I
—
I
believe
you
there
,
Master
Gray
.
<EOS>
You
are
no
fool
yourself
,
because
you

”“Exactly
,
”
cried
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“
This
is
a
lonely
district
.
<EOS>
”“Here
<EOS>
you
are
—
Ah
!
<EOS>
Ah

”
<EOS>
laughed
Sheldon
.
<EOS>
“
I
—
I
know
it
—
this
is
the

.
<EOS>
Bless
you
,
I

it

<EOS>
”Learmont
walked
to
the
middle
of
the
roadway
,
and
by
the
dim
morninglight
,
which
was
just
beginning
to
shed
a
faint
colour
across
the
duskysky
,
he
gazed
earnestly
at
the
ancient
building
,
in
which
he
had
nodoubt

the
objects
of
his
hatred
and
dread
.
<EOS>
“Well
,
”
said
Sheldon
,
“
ain’t
—
<EOS>
ain’t
you
going
to
ask
a
fellow
in
,
justto

a

something?”Learmont
heard
him
not
,
or
if
he
did
,
he
heeded
him
not
,
but
stoodintently
gazing
at
the
house
,
and
treasuring
up
in
his
memory
everylittle
peculiarity
he
could
by
the
faint
light
detect
,
in
order
that
hemight
again
recognise
it
without

or

.
<EOS>
“Hilloa

cried
Sheldon
.
<EOS>
“
What
are
you
staring
at
—
d
—
d
—
did

never

started
,
and
advancing
to
Sheldon
,
he
laid
his
hand
upon
hisshoulder
,
saying,—“My
good
friend
,
in
that
house
I
have
not

<EOS>
”“The

”
said
the
waterman
.
<EOS>
“Not

<EOS>
but
if

will
walk
with
me
till
we
come
to

I

Sheldon

<EOS>
”Learmont
<EOS>
took
the
arm
of
the
waterman
,
who
was
rapidly
becomingsentimental
again
,
and
,
passing
it
through
his
own
<EOS>
,
he
led
him
awayfrom
<EOS>
Gray
’s
house
at
a
quick
pace
.
<EOS>
The
morning
light
was
now
each
moment
increasing
,
and
Learmont
did
notfail
to
note
every
particular
building
he
passed
,
in
order
that
,
whenhe
came
again
,
he
should
need
no
guide
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
as
they
turned
the
corner
of
a
street
,
they
came
in
sight
ofthe
square
tower
of
the
Bishop
’s
Palace
,
at
Lambeth
,
and
as
Learmontknew
that
well
,
he
felt
quite
assured
that
he
could
from
that
,
as
aland
-
mark
,
walk
with
certainty
to
the
house
of
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
He
now
threw
his
whole
thoughts
into
a
consideration
of
what
was
to
bedone
with
his
intoxicated
companion
.
<EOS>
That
he
had
been
in
some
sort
ofcommunication
with
Jacob
Gray
<EOS>
he
could
not
doubt
,
and
moreover
,
heshrewdly
suspected
that
the
destruction
of
Britten
was
the
objecthinted
at
by
Sheldon
—
that
,
however
,
was
a
far
inferior
object
inLearmont
’s
mind
to
the
destruction
of
Gray
himself
,
and
the
possessionof
the
boy
he
held
in
his
power
.
<EOS>
Therefore
was
it
that
Learmont
fellinto
a
train
of
anxious
and
horrid
thoughts
as
to
whether
Sheldon
afterhe
had
left
him
might
not
,
by
his
relation
of
having
brought
some
oneto
his
secret
abode
,
alarm
the
cautious
Jacob
Gray
into
an
immediateremoval
,
and
so
baffle
him
,
Learmont
,
again
.
<EOS>
If
there
be
any
crime
more
awful
than
another
,
it
is
a
cool
anddeliberate
murder
founded
upon
calculation
;
but
Learmont
was
just
theman
to
commit
such
an
act
,
and
while
the
thoughtless
Sheldon
washanging
upon
his
arm
and
murmuring
disjointed
snatches
of
songs
inpraise
of
good
fellowship
and
glorious
wine
,
Learmont
half
resolvedupon
his
death
.
<EOS>
“This
drunken
idiot
can
be
of
no
use
to
me
,
”
he
reasoned
with
himself,“because
I
could
never
depend
upon
him
;
but
he
may
,
if
I
let
himescape
,
warn
Gray
,
and
I
lose
the
rare
chance
that
kind
Fortune
hasthrown
so
strangely
in
my
way
.
<EOS>
He
must
die
.
<EOS>
”They
now
passed
the
ancient
entrance
to
the
Bishop
’s
Palace
;
andentered
upon
the
well
-
known
walk
along
the
banks
of
the
Thames
,
whichwas
then
much
more
shadowed
by
lofty
trees
than
it
is
at
present
;
andalthough
those
trees
,
in
consequence
of
the
season
of
the
year
,
werenow
leafless
,
yet
their
gigantic
trunks
cast
broad
and
obscuringshadows
between
them
and
the
wall
of
the
Bishop
’s
garden
.
<EOS>
A
cold
piercing
air
blew
from
the
Thames
,
and
Sheldon
shuddered
as
heremarked,—“I
say
—
my
—
<EOS>

good
fellow
,
the
—

<EOS>
”“Come
<EOS>
this
way
,
close
to
the
palace

”
said
Learmont
,
“
and
the
oldtrees
will
save
us
from
the
cool
air
that
blows
across

.
<EOS>
”So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
led
his
doomed
companion
close
to
the
ancient
wall
,
thenhe
paused
and
listened
attentively
,
in
case
any
one
should
be
withinhearing
;
all
was
as
still
as
the
grave
—
not
the
most
distant
soundindicative
of
human
life

met
his
ears
.
<EOS>
“He
must
die

”
<EOS>
muttered
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“You
may
say

remarked
Sheldon
;

”Learmont
laid
his
hand
on
his
sword
as
he
said—“There
is
more
light
now
,
Master
Sheldon
.
<EOS>
Look

<EOS>
”As
<EOS>
he
spoke
he
raised
his
cap
,
which
previously
had
been
drawn
closeover
his
eyes
,
and
raised
himself
to
his
full
gaunt
height
.
<EOS>
The
waterman
fixed
his
wondering
eyes
upon
him

and
muttered:—“I

”“Do

<EOS>
cried
Learmont
,
fiercely
.
<EOS>
The
man
trembled
and
seemed
all
at
once
half
-
sobered
by
terror
as
hestammered—“I

”“Ah

<EOS>

called

<EOS>
”Learmont
suddenly
turned
his
back
upon
Sheldon
,
and
casting
an
anxiousglance
around
him
to
satisfy
himself
that
they
were
still
alone
,
hesuddenly
drew
his
sword
and
faced
the
trembling
man
.
<EOS>
“Mercy

<EOS>
cried
Sheldon

dropping
on
his

“Idiot

shortened

With

wild
shriek

rung
through

walk
,
Sheldon
sprangfrom
his
knees
;
he
grasped
wildly
at
the
air

and
spun
round

roundin
his
frantic
efforts
to

<EOS>
“Help

Help

Murder

<EOS>
he
shrieked
.
<EOS>
“Damnation

<EOS>
cried
Learmont
,
and
again
he
passed
his
reeking
swordthrough
the
heaving
chest
of
Sheldon

<EOS>
Again
the
wounded
man
tried
to
speak

a
low
gurgling
sound
in

all

CHAPTER
XXI.A
<EOS>
Sunny
Morning.—The
Chamber
in
the
Old
House
.
<EOS>
The
morning
gathered
each
moment
strength
and
beauty
,
for
it
wasbeautiful
,
although
the
trees
were
stripped
of
their
summer
verdure
,
and
the
earth
no
longer
sent
forth
sweet
flowers
to
—
Load
with
perfumesThe
<EOS>
soft
dreaming
idle
<EOS>
airThat
steeped
in
sunshines
.
<EOS>
Music
,
and
all
dear
delight
,
Hung
,
tranquilly
’
twixt
heaven
and
earth
.
<EOS>
The
sun
,
however
,
was
bright
,
and
the
air
,
although
the
soft
voluptuouswarmth
of
summer
,
was
full
of
health
and
life
.
<EOS>
The
little
waves
on
theriver
sparkled
like
silver
broken
into
fragments
and
strewed
upon
thesurface
of
the
stream
.
<EOS>
For
miles
the
clear
cloudless
sky
reflectednothing
but
pure
sunshine
,
beautiful
although
cold
;
it
shone
upon
thepalaces
,
the
churches
,
and
the
bridges
,
and
upon
the
meanest
hovelspregnant
with
squalid
poverty
;
it
shone
upon
all
alike
.
<EOS>
It
found
itsway
in
floods
of
beauty
,
softened
by
rich
colouring
of
glass
anddrapery
,
into
the
chambers
of
the
rich
and
great
,
and
it
struggledthrough
the
dingy
panes
of
the
cottage
windows
,
making
,
perchance
,
morehappiness
there
than
in
the
lordly
mansion
,
which
more
frequently
isthe
habitation
of
an
aching
heart
.
<EOS>
There
was
one
small
room
into
which
that
clear
morning
sun
shone
in
allits
dearly
-
welcomed
beauty
,
and
there
was
one
heart
that
was
cheered
byits
presence
,
and
smiled
gladly
in
its
radiant
light
;
that
room
intowhich
it
shone
was
<EOS>
the
sleeping
chamber
of
the
young
boy
,
Harry
,
andthat
heart
that
welcomed
its
rays
was
his
—
a
heart
that
ever
beat
inunison
with
all
that
was
good
—
all
that
was
beautiful
.
<EOS>
The
apartment
was
a
small
one
adjoining
a
spacious
room
that
was
on
thesecond
floor
of
the
house
,
and
communicating
with
it
by
folding
doors
.
<EOS>
It
contained
little
else
than
a
small
couch
and
a
few
necessaryarticles
of
the
toilette
.
<EOS>
A
large
mat
lay
at
the
door
,
on
which
reposedthe
dog
,
which
was
poor
Harry
’s
only
companion
—
his
only
friend
.
<EOS>
The
boy
was
up
and
leaning
upon
the
window
-
sill
,
gazing
earnestlythrough
a
small
chink
that
was
left
in
the
beading
(
for
the
window
wasblocked
up
from
without
)
which
enabled
him
to
see
,
and
without
dangerof
being
observed
by
any
one
in
the
street
,
and
likewise
was
quite
ofsufficient
width
to
allow
the
morning
sun
to
stream
into
the
littleroom
.
<EOS>
With
a
deep
sigh
he
turned
from
the
window
,
and
the
dog
at
the
samemoment
rose
,
and
with
grateful
gestures
approached
its
kind
master
.
<EOS>
“The
<EOS>
sun
is
shining
,
my
poor
Joy
,
”
said
Harry
,
mournfully
;
“
but
you
andI
may
not
gambol
in
its
beams
.
<EOS>
The
world
without
this
gloomy
houseseems
bright
and
beautiful
,
but
we
are
prisoners
,
’
tis
very
,
verystrange
;
Gray
tells
me
he
is
my
uncle
,
and
that
there
is
a
fearfulsecret
connected
with
the
family
that
forces
him
to
shut
himself
and
meup
in
this
mysterious
manner
.
<EOS>
Uncle
Gray
,
I
doubt
you
.
<EOS>
Such
a
talemight
suit
the
ears
of
a
child
,
but
—
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
—
I
am
one
no
longer
.
<EOS>
Can
this
manbe
my
uncle
?
<EOS>
His
behaviour
is
so
strange
to
me
,
alternately
harsh
andkind
,
affectionate
and
cruel
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
to
think
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
howmy
heart
yearns
for
the
bright
sunshine
,
the
open
sky
,
and
the
greenfields
!
<EOS>
How
long
am
I
to
be
thus
immured
?
<EOS>
Heaven
only
knows
.
<EOS>
I
—
will
—
Imust
seek
some
other
explanation
.
<EOS>
I
know
he
fears
me
<EOS>
,
I
have
seen
himshrink
before
my
eyes
.
<EOS>
I
have
marked
him
tremble
and
turn
pale
at
achance
word
I
uttered
,
and
yet
I
had
no
clue
to
such
feelings
<EOS>
,
becauseI
knew
not
which
word
<EOS>
it
was
that
moved
him
so
;
and
this
disguise
,
too
,
which
he
persuades
,
begs
,
implores
of
me
to
wear
,
as
he
says
,
for
mylife
<EOS>
’s
sake
;
’
tis
very
strange
.
<EOS>
These
are
not
the
garments
of
a
youngmaiden
as
I
am
.
<EOS>
What
have
I
done
that
I
should
,
thus
forswear
sex
,
liberty
,
sunshine
,
joy
,
all
that
makes
life
rich
,
and
beautiful
to
theyoung
?
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
What
have
I
done
to
be
a
dreary
prisoner
?
<EOS>
In
all
myweary
years
,
short
,
but
oh
,
how
long
to
me
!
<EOS>
But
one
face
beamed
withkindness
on
me
,
that
face
was
Albert
Seyton
’s
;
but
one
voice
spoke
tome
in
accents
of
love
and
pity
—
that
voice
was
Albert
Seyton
’s
;
but
oneheart
seemed
ever
to
really
feel
for
me
a
pang
of
sorrow
,
and
—
and
—
thatheart
was
Albert
Seyton’s
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
young
girl
,
for
such
she
was
,
sunk
into
a
chair
and
wept
bitterly
.
<EOS>
Then
suddenly
dashing
aside
the
tears
that
obscured
her
beautiful
eyes
,
she
said,—“No
—
<EOS>
no
,
I
will
not
weep
.
<EOS>
No
,
Uncle
Gray
,
if
such
you
be
,
you
shall
notwring
another
tear
from
me
.
<EOS>
You
have
made
me
a
lonely
being
;
you
havebeen
harsh
,
unkindly
—
<EOS>
nay
,
you
have
struck
me
;
but
you
shall
not
see
meweep
,
no
—
<EOS>
no
,
I
will
not
let
you
see
a
tear
.
<EOS>
You
have
torn
me
from
theyoung
heart
that
in
my
solitude
found
me
and
loved
me
as
an
orphan
boy
,
supposing
me
such
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Uncle
—
Uncle
,
you
are
cruel
!
<EOS>
Another
day
shallnot
pass
without
an
explanation
with
you
,
Uncle
Gray
.
<EOS>
I
—
I
—
will
havereasons
—
<EOS>
ample
reasons
—
full
explanations
from
thee
.
<EOS>
And
he
wanted
tokill
my
poor
dog
,
too
,
because
it
loved
me
—
because
I
had
found
someliving
thing
that
looked
fondly
in
my
face
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Uncle
!
<EOS>
Uncle
!
<EOS>
you
haveraised
a
spirit
in
my
breast
—
a
spirit
of
resistance
and
opposition
,
that
in
happier
circumstances
would
have
slumbered
for
ever
.
<EOS>
”For
<EOS>
a
few
minutes
the
young
girl
stood
in
deep
thought
,
then
,
with
aremarkable
alteration
of
tone
and
manner
<EOS>
,
she
said
,
suddenly,—“Come
,
Joy
,
come
;
we
will
go
to
Uncle
Gray
,
our
breakfast
should
bewaiting
.
<EOS>
”She
<EOS>
opened
the
door
which
led
into
the
larger
room
,
and
crossing
that
,
closely
followed
by
the
dog
,
passed
out
of
it
by
another
door
thatopened
upon
the
staircase
.
<EOS>
Slowly
then
,
she
descended
the
creaking
,
time
-
worn
steps
and
pushing
open
a
small
door
at
their
feet
,
enteredthe
room
which
has
already
been
described
to
the
reader
,
and
in
whichwe
last
left
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
Gray
was
in
the
room
,
and
he
cast
a
suspicious
glance
at
the
youngcreature
who
entered
the
room
,
as
if
he
would
read
from
her
countenancein
what
mood
she
was
in
that
morning
.
<EOS>
“Oh
,
”
he
said
,
“
you
have
risen
early
,
Harry
,
and
—
and
Joy
,
too
,
is
withyou
—
poor
dog!”Joy
<EOS>
’s
only
answer
to
this
hypocritical
pity
was
a
low
growl
,
andgetting
under
a
chair
,
he
exhibited
a
formidable
mouthful
of
teeth
as
awarning
to
Jacob
Gray
not
to
attempt
any
familiarity
.
<EOS>
“Do
<EOS>
not
call
me
Harry
,
”
cried
the
girl
,
“
you
know
it
is
not
a
fittingname
for
me
,
Uncle
.
”Gray
<EOS>
’s
<EOS>
face
assumed
a
paler
shade
,
as
he
replied
in
a
low
tone,—“Wherefore
this
sudden
passion
—
eh?”“Uncle
<EOS>
Gray
,
I
have
been
thinking—”“Thinking
of
what
,
child?”“Call
me
child
no
more
,
”
replied
the
girl
,
pushing
the
dark
ringletsfrom
her
brow
,
and
gazing
steadily
at
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
Call
me
child
no
more
,
Uncle
Gray
,
and
to
prove
to
you
that
I
am
something
more

I
tell

that
the
poor
tale
that
frightened
the
child
will
not

<EOS>
”“W
<EOS>
—
w
—
what
do
you
mean
?
”
<EOS>
gasped
Gray
,
his
lips
trembling
with
ghastlyfear
.
<EOS>
“I
mean
,
”
continued
the
other
,
“
that
the
time
has
come
when
I

Why

here
an

<EOS>
The
reasons

this
solitary
confinement

its
duration

that
would
rescue

this

all

I

I

<EOS>
”To
<EOS>
describe
the
wild
stare
of
astonishment
and
dismay
<EOS>
that
sat
upon
theface
of
Jacob
,
as
the
fragile
and
beautiful
creature
before
him
pouredforth
with
earnest
firmness
this
torrent
of
questions
,
would
beimpossible
:
<EOS>
rage
,
fear
,
dismay
,
all
seemed
struggling
for
mastery
inGray
’s
countenance
,
and
the
girl
had
done
,
and
stood
in
an
attitudethat
a
sculptor
might
have
envied
,
bending
half
forward
with
a
flush
ofexcitement
upon
her
cheeks
,
awaiting
the
answer
of
the
panic
-
strickenman
before
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
several
minutes
before
that
answer
came
.
<EOS>
Once
,
twice
,
thrice
,
did
Jacob
Gray
try
to
speak
in
vain
,
and
when
he
didproduce
an
articulate
sound
,
his
voice
was
hollow
and
awful
to
hear
.
<EOS>
“W
—
what
devil
,
”
he
said
,
“
has
prompted
you
to
this
?
<EOS>
What
busy
fiend
haswhispered
in
your
ears
?
<EOS>
Speak
—
speak!”“I
have
spoken
,
”
said
the
girl
.
<EOS>
“
I
ask
but
that
I
have
the
right
toknow
.
<EOS>
”“The
right

<EOS>
How
know
you
that?”“How

I
that

<EOS>
My

tells
me

’
<EOS>
Tis
a
right
of
nature
,
born
withthe
lowest
,
and
no
greater
with
the

.
<EOS>
”“Then
<EOS>
—
you
would
destroy
me!”“No
,
I
would
destroy
no
one
;
give
no
one
even
a
passing
pang

but
oh!Uncle

I
am
young

and
life
is
new

precious

<EOS>
I
have
read
of
sunnyskies

and
smiling
happy
flowers
;
I
have
read
of
music

witchery

until
my

create
its

I

Ada
what?Tell
me

for
the
love
of
Heaven
,
all
,
and
if
you
have
done
me
wrong
,
Uncle
,
I
will
,
forgive
you
,
as
I
live!”Jacob
Gray
’s
voice
trembled
and
the
perspiration
stood
in
cold
dropsupon
his
brow
,
as
he
said
,
faintly,—“Water
!
<EOS>
Water
!
<EOS>
Water!—I
—
<EOS>
I
am
faint!”Ada
,
<EOS>
for
henceforward
we
will
call
her
by
that
name
,
filled
a
glasswith
sparkling
cold
water
,
and
handed
it
in
silence
to
the
tremblingman
.
<EOS>
With
a
shaking
hand
he
raised
it
to
his
lips
,
and
drank
deeply
ofit
;
the
glass
dropped
from
his
nervous
grasp
,
and
lay
in
fragments
onthe
floor
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
—
I
am
better
now
,
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
Ada
stood
before
him
—
her
dark
eyes
bent
on
his
with
a
scrutinisingglance
,
beneath
which
he
shrunk
abashed
.
<EOS>
“Now
<EOS>
then
,
Uncle
Gray
,
”
she
said
,
“
now
that
you
are
better
,
will
youanswer
me?”Gray
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
or
two
in
silence
before
he
replied;then
<EOS>
he
said
slowly,—“What
if
I
refuse
to
answer
the
question
<EOS>
you
ask?”“Then
is
our
compact
broken
,
”
cried
Ada
.
<EOS>
“And
<EOS>
—
and
—
what
will
you
do
?
<EOS>
What
,
<EOS>
can
you
do?”“What
can
I
do
?
<EOS>
I
can
toil
,
work
,
attend
upon
those
who
may
perchancerepay
my
service
with
a
smile
,
ample
and
dear
wages
to
the
poor
,
desolate
child
of
harshness
and
misfortune
.
<EOS>
I
will
leave
you
and
thisgloomy
abode
for
ever
,
and
trust
to
the
mercy
of
that
Providence
thatfinds
food
for
the
merest
insect
that
buzzes
in
the
evening
time!”“Humph
!
”
<EOS>
muttered
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
I
never
knew
Providence
to
feed
anything
yet
.
<EOS>
Providence
will
let
you
die
on
a
door
-
step
,
and
rot
in
a
kennel!”“Peace

cried
Ada
,
“

<EOS>
Blind
obedience

<EOS>
There
was
a
plan
which
would
haveensured
its
continuance
.
”“Indeed
!
<EOS>
What
plan?”“A
simple
one
,
”
said
Ada
,
mournfully
:
“
Uncle
Gray
,
you
might

<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
—
I
have
used
you
well
,
”
stammered
Gray
.
<EOS>
“Well
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Ada
;
“
Uncle
,
you
have
scoffed
at
my
childish

<EOS>
Ihave
felt
even

you

<EOS>
Used

looked
down
for
a
few
moments
;
then
he
said,—“To

<EOS>
Yes

”“To

<EOS>
Well

continued
Gray
,
“

no

”“Tell

said
the
girl
,
kindly
,
“

”Jacob
<EOS>
Gray
rose
,
and
keeping
his
small
,
keen
,
grey
eyes
fixed
on
Ada
,
he
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
Outside
the
door
he
paused
,
and
,
raising
his
clenchedhand
,
while
his
face
was
distorted
with
passion
,
he
muttered,“To

XXII.Learmont
at
Home.—His
Exultation.—The
Smith.—The
Plot
.
<EOS>
Learmont
,
after
committing
the
cold
-
blooded
and
brutal
murder
in
theBishop
<EOS>
’s
Walk
,
hastily
wiped
his
blood
-
stained
sword
,
and
walkedquickly
onwards
till
he
came
to
the
further
extremity
of
the
avenue
.
<EOS>
Hethen
darted
down
a
narrow
opening
,
which
led
him
first
away
from
,
andthen
by
a
circuitous
route
,
to
the
back
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
“Boat!—Boat
!
”
he
cried
,
impatiently
,
and
from
a
mean
habitation
a
boyimmediately
emerged
.
<EOS>
“Can
you
row
me
across
?
”
<EOS>
cried
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“Yes
,
your
worship
,
”
replied
the
boy
.
<EOS>
“
This
way
,
an
’
it
please
yourhonour
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
led
the
way
to
a
wherry
which
was
moored
close
to
some
little
woodensteps
,
and
Learmont
,
seating
himself
in
the
boat
,
<EOS>
said,—“Quick!—Quick
!
<EOS>
I
am
in
haste
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
boy
handled
his
skulls
with
dexterity
,
and
the
boat
soon
reachedthe
Middlesex
shore
.
<EOS>
Throwing
him
a
piece
of
silver
,
Learmont
stridedover
the
boy
,
and
was
soon
at
his
own
house
in
Westminster
.
<EOS>
Withoutdeigning
the
slightest
notice
to
his
servants
at
the
hall
of
themansion
,
who
made
obsequious
way
for
him
as
he
entered
,
he
strodeonwards
till
he
came
to
the
room
in
which
he
had
sat
the
precedingevening
,
when
his
thoughts
had
been
so
great
a
torment
to
him
,
and
,
flinging
himself
into
a
chair
,
he
began
to
think
over
the
singularevents
of
the
night
,
and
to
arrange
the
plan
that
he
had
alreadyconceived
for
the
destruction
of
Gray
,
and
the
possession
of
his
youngcharge
.
<EOS>
“This
is
indeed
a
stroke
of
good
fortune
,
”
he
said
.
<EOS>
“
By
Gray’sdestruction
I
gain
much
.
<EOS>
The
dull
-
witted
sot
Britton
is
not
half
theannoyance
that
this
Jacob
Gray
has
proved
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
hate
—
<EOS>
I
abhor
him
.
<EOS>
Let
me
consider
how
the
case
stands.—He
lives
in
a
solitary
,
miserableabode
,
out
of
the
way
of
note
or
observation
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Master
Gray
,
you
haveoutwitted
yourself
here
!
<EOS>
With
him
,
of
course
,
is
the
great
object
ofall
my
fears
.
<EOS>
My
worst
enemy
is
that
boy
,
whose
existence
I
am
so
farsure
of
from
the
statement
of
the
babbling
fool
who
has
paid
with
lifefor
meddling
with
affairs
beyond
his
comprehension
.
<EOS>
So
far
,
so
good
.
<EOS>
Those
papers
containing
Gray
’s
written
confession
that
he
speaks
of
,
let
me
consider
well
of
them
.
<EOS>
The
object
of
writing
them
was
that
theyshould
be
found
,
in
case
of
his
death
—
<EOS>
found
where
?
<EOS>
In
his
home
,
ofcourse
,
and
easily
found
,
too
,
most
easily
;
because
they
were
to
fallinto
the
hands
of
persons
not
searching
for
them
;
so
they
must
be
insome
place
easy
of
discovery
;
and
most
simple
of
access
.
<EOS>
How
easy
thenwill
it
be
for
me
to
find
them
,
knowing
that
they
are
there
,
anddetermined
to
leave
no
nook
or
corner
unsearched
till
I
do
find
them
.
<EOS>
Good
,
good
;
and
the
result
:
Gray
dead
—
<EOS>
the
boy
is
in
my
power
,
and
theconfession
,
which
was
to
preserve
him
so
well
to
be
my
torment
—
in
theflames
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
all
is
clear
,
quite
clear
;
and
now
for
the
immediatemeans
.
<EOS>
”For
<EOS>
several
minutes
he
paced
the
apartment
in
silent
thought
,
thensuddenly
pausing
,
he
exclaimed:—“Certainly
;
who
so
proper
as
Britton
?
<EOS>
It
is
a
great
and
importantprinciple
in
all
these
matters
to
confine
them
to
as
few
hands
aspossible
.
<EOS>
Britton
already
knows
enough
for
mischief
,
and
his
knowledgebeing
a
little
extended
,
can
not
make
him
much
more
noxious
.
<EOS>
He
shallaid
me
.
<EOS>
He
and
I
will
storm
your
garrison
,
Master
Jacob
Gray
!
<EOS>
Cunning
,
clever
,
Jacob
Gray
!
<EOS>
And
then
,
why
then
,
I
have
<EOS>
but
one
more
object
toaccomplish
,
and
that
is
the
death
of
Britton
!
<EOS>
The
boy
,
too
—
By
Heavens
,
I
always
had
my
doubts
if
it
were
a
boy
!
<EOS>
This
drunken
fool
,
who
I
havebeen
compelled
to
put
out
of
the
way
of
mischief
,
saw
him
though
,
anddoubt
vanishes
.
<EOS>
He
shall
either
die
,
or
be
rendered
innoxious
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
clever
,
artful
,
Jacob
Gray
,
I
have
you
on
the
hip!”A
servant
now
opened
the
door
slowly
,
and
Learmont
turning
quickly
onhim
with
a
frowning
brow
,
<EOS>
cried,—“How
now
,
sirrah
?
<EOS>
Why
this
intrusion?”“An
’
<EOS>
it
please
your
worship

”
said
the
man
,
“
there
is
one
below
whowould
have
speech
of
your
worship
.
”“Speech
<EOS>
of
me?”“Ay
,
truly
;
an

it
please
your—”“Pshaw

”
<EOS>
cried
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“
Use
fewer
words
!
<EOS>
Who
is
it
that
waits
to
seeme?”“He
<EOS>
says
he
brings
a
message
from
the
Old
Smithy
;
but
I
thought
,
yourworship—”“You
thought
,
”
cried
Learmont
,
making
two
gigantic
strides
,
and
seizingthe
trembling
domestic
by
the
throat
.
<EOS>
“
You
thought
!
<EOS>
Wretch
!
<EOS>
If
you
dareto
think
about
any

,
I
’d
give
your

<EOS>

groaned
the
servant
.
<EOS>
“
I

I’llnever

as
long

!
<EOS>
And
show
him
who
asks
for
me
to
this
room
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
terrified
man
made
haste
from
the
apartment
,
and
in
three
or
fourminutes
Britton
,
the
smith
,
staggered
into
the
room
with
an
air
of
themost
insolent
and
independent
familiarity
.
<EOS>
His
face
was
bloated
and
swollen
from
his
deep
debauch
of
the
previousnight
,
and
his
eyes
looked
sleepy
and
blood
-
shot
.
<EOS>
His
attire
hungloosely
on
his
huge
form
,
and
he
was
altogether
the
picture
offerocity
,
and
sensuality
.
<EOS>
“Good
morning
to
you
,
squire
,
”
he
said
,
as
he
threw
himself
into
achair
.
<EOS>
“
By
G
—
you
are
well
lodged
here
.
<EOS>
You
have
n’t
a
spare
room
,
haveyou?”Learmont
stood
with
his
back
to
the
light
,
so
that
he
was
not
in
afavourable
position
for
the
smith
to
notice
the
working
of
hiscountenance
,
where
indignation
,
hatred
and
policy
were
battling
forpre
-
eminence
.
<EOS>
“Away
with
this
nonsense
,
”
cried
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“
What
brings
you
here?”“What
brings
me
here
?
<EOS>
Why
,
my
legs
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
It
’s
too
short
adistance
to
think
of
riding
.
<EOS>
”“Your
errand
?
”
<EOS>
cried
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“Money

”
bellowed
Britton
,
in
a
still
louder
voice
.
<EOS>
“Money
!
<EOS>
Again
so
soon?”“Ay
;
so
soon
.
<EOS>
I
have
found
a
mine
,
and
I
do
n’t
see
why
I
should
notwork
it
,
as
that
infernal
Jacob
Gray
says
.
”“Oh
!
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
says
that

does

<EOS>
sneered
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“On
<EOS>
my
faith
he
does

’
<EOS>
Tis
<EOS>
a
shrewd
knave
,
<EOS>

I
hate
him

<EOS>
I
hate
him

I
say!”“Indeed

says
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“
He
says
you
are
a
beastly
sot

good
Britton

<EOS>
”“Does
he?”“Ay
,
does
he

<EOS>
A
thick
skulled

drunken
idiot

<EOS>
”“Ha

<EOS>
He
says
that
of

so

a

savage

curses

”
<EOS>
muttered
Britton
.
<EOS>
“How
<EOS>
much
money
do
you
want
?
”
<EOS>
said
Learmont
,
very
suddenly
.
<EOS>
“Twenty
pieces

”“Twenty

<EOS>
Pshaw

make
them
forty
or
fifty

provided

”“Revenge

I

““Have

<EOS>
I
watched
him

he
doubled
on

I
losthim

”“Indeed

Then
you
know

I—”“I

”“You

sprang
to

he
cried

“
Kill

”The

shook
his
clenched

as
he
left
the

muttering,—“I

<EOS>
I
shall
have
my
revenge!”Fortune
now
,
indeed
,
appeared
to
have
favoured
the
Squire

Learmont
,
beyond
his
most
sanguine
expectations

<EOS>
What
was
there
to
stay
hisprogress
up
the

of
his

was
there
to
say
to
him
,
“
Thus
far

thou
go

<EOS>
no

not
every
circumstance
conspire
to
favour
his
greatest

his
mostarrogant
wishes
?
<EOS>
Nay
,
even
the
very
fear
and
disquiet
of
the
last
tenyears
of
his
life
had
unconsciously
,
as
it
were
,
conspired
to
place
himon
the
proud
height
he
so
much
panted
for

fancied

enjoyso
truly

for
by
such
circumstances
<EOS>
the
revenues
of
the
broad

Learmont
had
accumulated
to
the
vast
sum
which
he
now
had
in

a
sum
so
large
,
that
,
in

CHAPTER
XXIII.The
<EOS>
Projected
Murder.—The
Unconscious
Sleeper.—A
Night
of
Horror
.
<EOS>
It
wanted
but
one
hour
of
midnight
,
and
silence
reigned
about
theruined
and
deserted
street
in
which
Jacob
Gray
resided
.
<EOS>
Heavy
cloudshung
in
the
sky
,
and
not
a
star
peeped
forth
to
look
with
shiningbeauty
on
the
darkened
world
.
<EOS>
A
misty
vapour
,
betokening
the
breakingof
the
frost
,
arose
from
the
surface
of
the
Thames
,
and
occasionally
agust
of
wind
from
the
south
-
west
brought
with
it
a
dashing
shower
ofmingled
rain
and
sleet
.
<EOS>
A
clammy
dampness
was
upon
every
thing
bothwithin
doors
and
without
;
the
fires
and
lights
in
the
barges
on
theriver
burnt
through
the
damp
vapour
with
a
sickly
glare
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
nightof
discomfort
,
such
as
frequently
occur
in
the
winter
seasons
of
ourvariable
and
inconstant
climate
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
night
to
enjoy
the
comfortsof
warm
fire
-
sides
and
smiling
faces
;
a
night
on
which
domestic
joysand
social
happiness
became
still
more
dear
and
precious
from
contrastwith
the
chilling
prospect
of
Nature
in
the
open
air
.
<EOS>
In
the
room
which
has
already
been
described
to
the
reader
as
the
onein
which
Jacob
Gray
usually
sat
in
his
lone
and
ruinous
habitation
,
henow
stood
by
the
window
listening
to
the
various
clocks
of
the
city
asthey
struck
the
hour
of
eleven
.
<EOS>
A
bright
fire
was
blazing
on
the
hearth
,
but
still
Jacob
Gray
trembledand
his
teeth
chattered
as
he
counted
the
solemn
strokes
of
somedistant
church
bell
,
the
sound
of
which
came
slowly
,
and
with
a
muffledtone
,
through
the
thick
murky
air
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
all
was
still
again
.
<EOS>
The
sounds
had
ceased
.
<EOS>
Nothingmet
the
ear
of
Jacob
Gray
but
the
low
moaning
of
the
gathering
wind
asit
swept
around
his
dilapidated
dwelling
.
<EOS>
Then
he
turned
from
thewindow
and
faced
the
fire
-
light
,
but
even
with
its
ruddy
glow
upon
hisface
,
he
looked
ill
and
ghastly
.
<EOS>
His
step
was
unsteady
,
he
drew
hisbreath
short
and
thick
,
and
it
was
evident
from
the
whole
aspect
anddemeanour
of
the
man
that
his
mind
was
under
the
influence
of
someexcitement
of
an
extraordinary
nature
.
<EOS>
In
vain
he
strove
to
warm
the
blood
that
crept
rather
than
flowed
inhealthy
currents
through
his
veins
.
<EOS>
He
held
his
trembling
hands
closeto
the
fire
.
<EOS>
He
strove
to
assume
attitudes
of
careless
ease
.
<EOS>
He
eventried
to
smile
,
but
produced
nothing
but
a
cold
and
ghastly
distortionof
the
features
of
his
face
.
<EOS>
“Surely
,
”
he
muttered
,
“
the
—
the
night
must
be
very
cold
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
that
isit
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
chilling
night
.
<EOS>
Eleven
—
eleven
o’clock
.
<EOS>
I
—
I
—
meant
to
do
itat
eleven
;
at
—
at
least
before
twelve
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
before
twelve
—
there
is
time
,
ample
time
.
’
<EOS>
Tis
very
—
very
cold
.
<EOS>
”With
<EOS>
a
shaking
hand
,
he
poured
from
a
flask
,
that
was
upon
the
table
,
aquantity
of
raw
spirit
,
and
quaffed
it
off
at
a
single
draught
.
<EOS>
Howstrange
<EOS>
it
is
that
the
mind
can
,
under
peculiar
circumstances
soentirely
conquer
the
body
and
subvert
,
as
it
were
,
the
ordinary
laws
ofnature
!
<EOS>
Such
,
was
the
frightful
state
of
excitement
which
Jacob
Grayhad
worked
himself
up
to
,
that
he
might
as
well
have
swallowed
an
equalquantity
of
water
,
for
all
the
effect
that
the
strong
spirit
had
uponhim
.
<EOS>
Still
he
trembled
,
still
his
teeth
chattered
in
his
head
,
and
<EOS>
hisvery
heart
appeared
to
him
to
be
cold
and
lifeless
in
his
breast
.
<EOS>
Heheaped
fuel
upon
the
fire
<EOS>
,
he
paced
the
room
,
he
strove
to
think
ofsomething
else
than
the
one
subject
that
filled
his
brain
,
but
all
wasin
vain
.
<EOS>
He
had
determined
that
night
to
murder
the
hapless
girl
whomhe
had
wronged
so
much
,
and
he
had
passed
a
day
and
evening
ofunspeakable
agony
in
working
up
his
mind
to
do
the
deed
calmly
andsurely
.
<EOS>
Ten
o’clock
he
had
pitched
upon
as
the
hour
,
then
half
-
past
ten
,
theneleven
,
and
still
he
trembled
with
dismay
,
and
could
not
for
his
lifecommand
his
nerves
to
do
the
dreadful
deed
.
<EOS>
He
now
flung
himself
into
a
chair
by
the
fire
-
side
,
and
covering
hisface
with
his
hands
he
rocked
to
and
fro
,
in
agonising
thoughts
.
<EOS>
In
alow
tone
then
he
held
unholy
communion
with
himself
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
—
I
must
do
it
,
”
he
said
.
<EOS>
“
I
must
do
it
.
<EOS>
I
always
thought
it
wouldcome
to
this
.
<EOS>
When
she
became

was

<EOS>
No

no

<EOS>
She

she

be
my

should

of
Learmont
,
in
which
case
I
lose
my
chiefhold
upon
him
,
or
,
what
is
worse
,
she
tells
her
strange
tale
to
someone
,
who
may
hunt
me
to
force
an
explanation
of
her
birth
.
<EOS>
There
is
butone
resource
;
she
—
she
must
die

<EOS>
Yes
,
she
must
die
.
<EOS>
Learmont
stillfancying
’
tis
a

,
must
still
be
tortured
by
the
idea
that
such
anenemy
lives
,
and
requires
but
a
word
from
me
to
topple
him
from
hisheight
of
grandeur
to
a
felon
’s
cell
.
<EOS>
Yes
—
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
That
must
be
the
course
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
other
—
none
—
none
.
<EOS>
Then
I
will
accumulate
what
sum
of
money
Ican
,
and
leave
England
for
ever
—
for
—
for
well
<EOS>
I

<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
rose
and
paced
the
room
again
for
several
minutes
in
silence
;
thentaking
from
the
table
a
small
-
hand
lamp
,
he
lit
it
,
and
clutching
itwith
a
nervous
grasp
in
his
left
hand
,
he
muttered,—“Now

<EOS>
It

<EOS>
Tis

which

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
No

<EOS>
Ada

”He
<EOS>
placed
the
lamp
again
upon
the
table
,
and
approaching
with
astealthy
step
a
cupboard
in
the
room
,
he
took
from
it
a
double
-
edgedponiard
.
<EOS>
With
a
trembling
hand
he
placed
the
weapon
conveniently
withinhis
vest
,
and
then
casting
around
him
a
hurried
and
scared
glance
,
asif
he
expected
to
find
some
eyes
fixed
upon
him
,
he
walked
to
the
doorof
the
room
.
<EOS>
There
he
paused
,
and
,
divested
himself
of
his
shoes
,
after
which
,
witha
slow
,
stealthy
movement
,
he
began
ascending
the
stairs
to
the
chamberin
which
reposed
,
in
innocence
and
peace
,
the
unconscious
Ada
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
he
paused
,
and
staggered
against
the
wall
,
as
a
new
thoughtstruck
his
mind
.
<EOS>
“The
hound
!
<EOS>
the
hound
!
”
<EOS>
he
gasped
.
<EOS>
“
I
—
I
had
forgotten
the
dog

<EOS>
”Here
<EOS>
seemed
at
once
an
insurmountable
obstacle
to
the
execution
of
hismurderous
intention
,
and
for
several
minutes
Jacob
Gray
sat
down
on
thestaircase
in
deep
thought
,
while
his
face
was
distorted
by
contendingpassions

hate
—
fear
—
and
rage

<EOS>
“Curses
<EOS>
—
curses
on

dog

”
<EOS>
he
muttered
,
as
he
ground
his
teethtogether
and
clenched
his
hands
in
impotent
malice
.
<EOS>
“
To
be
foiled
by
ahalf
-
starved

Curses

There
is
a

one

The

sleepsby
the
door

sometimes
on

mat
on
the
outside
,
and
sometimes
withinthe
chamber
.
<EOS>
We
shall
see
—
we
shall
see
—
the
poison

<EOS>
Ay
,
the
poison!”Cautiously
he
descended
the
few
steps
he
had
gained
,
and
going
to
adrawer
in
the
table
,
which
he
had
the
key
of
,
and
which
stood
close
tothe
blazing
fire
,
in
the
room
he
had
so
recently
left
,
he
took
from
itthe
phial
of
poison
which
he
,
Learmont
,
had
given
to
him
.
<EOS>
After
amoment
’s
thought
,
he
repaired
to
the
cupboard
,
and
taking
from
it
theremains
of
some
meat
,
upon
which
he
had
dined
,
he
poured
at
leastone
-
half
the
contents
of
the
small
bottle
of
poison
over
it
.
<EOS>
“This
deadly
liquid
,
”
he
said
,
“
has
a
grateful
smell
.
<EOS>
If
I
can
inducethe
hound
to
fasten
on
this
meat
<EOS>
,
his
death
is
certain
and
quick

forLearmont

.
<EOS>
Poison
from
him
I
shouldassume
to
be
deadly
indeed
!
<EOS>
Ay
,
deadly
indeed!”Jacob
Gray
’s
hatred
for
the
dog
seemed
to
have
got
in
some
degree
overhis
extreme
nervousness
,
and
it
was
with
a
firmer
step
now
than
hecould
command
before
,
that
he
cautiously
again
ascended
the
narrowstaircase
conducting
to
Ada
’s
chamber
.
<EOS>
Still
,
however
,
in
his
heart
,
he
quailed
at
the
murder
—
the
deliberate
,
cold
-
blooded
murder
of
that
innocent
and
beautiful
girl
,
and
hepresented
the
ghastly
appearance
of
a
resuscitated
corpse
,
rather
thana
human
being
who
had
not
passed
the
portals
of
the
grave
.
<EOS>
The
feelingof
honourable
humanity
was
a
stranger
to
the
bosom
of
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
Hedid
not
shrink
from
the
murder
of
the
poor
and
persecuted
Ada
,
becauseit
was
a
murder
—
<EOS>
no
,
it
was
because
he
,
Jacob
Gray
,
had
to
do
it
,
unaided
and
un
-
cheered
in
the
unholy
deed
,
by
aught
save
his
ownshivering
and
alarmed
imagination
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
had
no
compunction
forthe
deed
;
his
only
terror
arose
from
the
fact
that
he
could
not
shiftits
consummation
on
to
some
one
else
’s
shoulders
.
<EOS>
He
would
gladly
have
held
a
light
to
guide
the
dagger
of
anotherassassin
,
but
he
did
shrink
from
the
personal
danger
and
the
personalconsequences
of
doing
it
himself
.
<EOS>
He
was
one
of
those
who
would
watchthe
door
while
the
murder
was
doing
—
hold
a
vessel
to
catch
theblood
—
anything
but
do
the
deed
himself
.
<EOS>
His
little
accession
of
strength
and
confidence
now
only
arose
from
thefact
that
owing
to
the
intervention
of
the
circumstance
of
the
dog
,
themurder
was
,
as
it
were
,
put
off
for
a
little
time
;
he
must
firstdispose
of
the
dog
,
then
the
murder
itself
,
with
all
its
damning
trainof
fears
and
agonies
,
would
take
its
former
prominent
place
in
hismind
,
and
again
would
Jacob
Gray
tremble
to
his
very
heart
’s
core
.
<EOS>
Stealthily
he
moved
his
way
up
the
staircase
,
his
great
object
being
toascertain
<EOS>
if
the
dog
was
within
or
without
the
chamber
of
Ada
.
<EOS>
His
doubts
were
soon
resolved
,
for
suddenly
a
low
growl
from
thefaithful
animal
smote
his
ears
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
gave
a
malignant
smile
,
as
he
said
in
a
low
whisper
,
“
Thedog
is
outside
the
door
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
growl
of
the
hound
now
deepened
to
a
louder
note
,
and
just
as
thatagain
was
shaping
itself
to
a
short
angry
bark
,
Jacob
Gray
threw
up
thepiece
of
poisoned
meat
on
to
the
landing
on
the
top
of
the
staircase
.
<EOS>
Folding
his
lamp
then
under
the
lappels
of
his
coat
,
Jacob
Gray
satdown
on
the
staircase
,
with
a
feeling
of
gratification
on
his
mind
,
that
,
in
all
human
probability
he
was
at
length
revenged
on
the
pooranimal
,
whose
only
crime
had
been
too
much
affection
and
fidelitytowards
<EOS>
the
hand
that
fed
and
caressed
him
,
and
the
voice
that
spoke
tohim
in
kindly
tones
.
<EOS>
All
was
as
still
as
the
grave
after
the
meat
had
been
thrown
,
and
afterseveral
minutes
of
suspense
,
Jacob
Gray
began
to
feel
anxious
for
someindication
of
the
success
of
his
scheme
.
<EOS>
Cautiously
,
he
then
ascended
astep
or
two
,
and
paused
—
no
sound
met
his
ears
.
<EOS>
A
few
steps
more
weregained
—
then
a
few
more
and
finally
,
by
stretching
out
his
arm
with
thelight
,
he
could
command
a
view
of
the
landing
-
place
,
but
he
looked
invain
for
the
dog
<EOS>
:
the
animal
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
nowstood
fairly
upon
the
landing
,
and
peered
carefully
around
him
,
<EOS>
withthe
hope
of
seeing
the
body
of
his
foe
,
but
such
was
not
the
case
.
<EOS>
The
open
door
of
the
outer
room
which
led
to
Ada
’s
smaller
sleepingchamber
now
caught
his
eyes
,
and
at
once
afforded
a
clue
to
the
retreatof
the
dog
.
<EOS>
With
a
soft
footfall
that
could
not
have
possibly
disturbed
thelightest
sleeper
,
Gray
entered
that
room
,
and
moving
his
hand
slowlyround
him
,
so
as
to
illuminate
by
turns
all
parts
of
the
apartment
,
hesaw
,
at
length
,
the
object
of
his
search
.
<EOS>
Close
up
to
the
door
leading
to
Ada
’s
room
was
the
hound
quite
dead
.
<EOS>
The
faithful
creature
had
evidently
made
an
effort
to
awaken
,
itsgentle
and
kind
mistress
,
for
its
paws
were
clenched
against
the
bottomof
the
door
,
where
there
was
a
crevice
left
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
Jacob
Gray
glanced
at
the
fixed
eyes
of
the
dog
,
then
hespurned
it
from
the
door
with
his
foot
,
as
he
muttered,—“Humph
!
<EOS>
So
far
successful
and
now
for
—
<EOS>
for—”“The
murder
,
”
he
would
have
said
,
but
in
one
moment
,
as
if
paralysed
bythe
touch
of
some
enchanter
’s
wand
,
all
his
old
fears
returned
uponhim
,
and
now
that
there
was
no
obstacle
between
him
and
the
commissionof
<EOS>
the
awful
deed
he
meditated
<EOS>
,
he
leaned
against
the
wall
for
support
,
and
the
perspiration
of
fear
rolled
down
his
face
in
heavy
drops
,
andgave
his
countenance
an
awful
appearance
of
horror
and
death
-
likepaleness
.
<EOS>
“What
<EOS>
—
what
,
”
he
stammered
,
“
<EOS>
what
if
she
should
scream
?
<EOS>
God
of
Heaven
,
if
she
should
scream!”So
terrified
was
he
at
the
supposition
that
his
victim
might
,
in
herdeath
-
struggle
,
find
breath
to
scream
,
that
for
a
moment
he
gave
up
hispurpose
,
and
retreated
slowly
backwards
from
the
room
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
now
the
silence
that
reigned
without
was
broken
by
the
variouschurches
striking
twelve
.
<EOS>
Gray
started
as
the
sounds
met
his
ear
.
<EOS>
“Twelve
!
<EOS>
Twelve
!
”
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
“
It
—
it
—
should
have
been
done
ere

<EOS>
To

<EOS>
The

ofGray

<EOS>
The
last
faint
echo
from
the
slowest
clock
had
died
away
upon
themidnight
air
,
when
Jacob
Gray
started
from
his
position
of
deepattention
,
and
placing
his
small
lamp
on
one
of
the
window
sills
,
hedrew
from
his
breast
the
knife
with
which
he
intended
to
take
the
lifeof
the
hapless
Ada
.
<EOS>
“She
<EOS>
—
she
surely
sleeps
sound
,
”
he
muttered
through
his
clenched
teeth,“or
all
these
clocks
with
their
solemn
and
prolonged
echoes
must
haveawakened
her
.
<EOS>
Yes
;
I
—
I
—
hope
she
sleeps
sound
.
<EOS>
I
—
would
not
have
astruggle
—
a
struggle
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
no
,
no
,
not
for
worlds
.
<EOS>
I
—
can
fancy
herclinging
to
the
knife
and
screaming
—
shrieking
even
as
—
as
—
her
—
fatherdid
—
when
he
had
his
death
wound
.
<EOS>
That
would
be
horrible
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
mosthorrible
—
<EOS>
and
yet
I
must
kill
her
.
<EOS>
I
must
kill
her
.
<EOS>
Did
she
not
brave
meto
my
face
?
<EOS>
Did
she
not
tell
me
that
she
suspected
me
and
my
motives
,
and
that
no
more
would
she
keep
herself
immured
for
my
sake
?
<EOS>
I
—
she
—
shedid
,
and
more
than
this
,
far
more
,
she
taunted
me
with
.
<EOS>
Yes
—
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
—
I
amquite
justified
—
<EOS>
she
must
die!”The
<EOS>
door
which
led
into
the
inner
chamber
was
in
two
compartments
,
andwhen
Gray
gently
pushed
against
them
,
they
both
opened
slightly
,
andthe
dim
,
sickly
light
of
a
lamp
from
the
interior
room
,
to
hissurprise
,
gleamed
through
the
crevice
,
meeting
the
kindred
ray
of
theone
which
Jacob
Gray
had
placed
so
carefully
out
of
the
way
of
,
as
hethought
,
the
eyes
of
the
sleeping
girl
.
<EOS>
He
crept
into
the
room
,
and
stood
motionless
for
many
minutes
,
regarding
the
sight
that
met
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
Seated
by
a
small
table
,
onwhich
was
the
lamp
dimly
burning
and
near
its
expiration
,
was
Ada
,
completely
dressed
,
but
fast
asleep
.
<EOS>
Her
face
rested
partially
upon
anopen
book
,
which
she
had
evidently
been
reading
before
retiring
torest
,
when
sleep
must
have
come
upon
her
unawares
,
and
sealed
hereyelids
in
forgetfulness
.
<EOS>
Her
long
hair
fell
in
beautiful
disorder
upon
the
table
,
and
the
oneeyelash
that
was
visible
hung
upon
her
fair
cheek
wet
with
tears
.
<EOS>
Shehad
been
weeping
,
but
whether
from
some
vision
that
crossed
herslumbers
,
or
from
lonesome
and
unhappy
thoughts
previous
to
droppinginto
that
temporary
oblivion
of
sorrow
,
could
not
be
known
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
stood
like
one
spell
-
bound
by
some
horrible
apparition
,
forto
the
wicked
can
there
be
a
more
horrible
apparition
than
youth
,
beauty
,
and
innocence?“She
<EOS>
—
she
sleeps
,
”
he
gasped
;
“
but
by
some
strange
fatality
has
notretired
to
bed
.
<EOS>
My
—
my
task
is
now
ten
times
more
difficult
.
<EOS>
I
—
<EOS>
I
knownot
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
knife
trembled
in
his
grasp
,
and
he
shook
vehemently
;
then
,
as
alow
murmuring
sound
escaped
the
lips
of
Ada
,
he
sunk
slowly
down
,
firstcrouchingly
,
then
on
his
knees
,
and
lastly
he
grovelled
on
the
groundat
her
feet
in
mortal
agony
,
lest
she
should
awaken
and
see
him
there
,
with
those
starting
eyes
,
those
livid
lips
and
that
knife
,
which
hecame
to
bury
in
her
innocent
and
gentle
heart
.
<EOS>
Some
fearful
vision
was
passing
over
the
imagination
of
the
sleepinggirl
.
<EOS>
Fancy
was
busy
in
the
narrow
chambers
of
the
brain
,
and
picturedto
her
some
scene
of
sorrow
or
terror
;
deep
sobs
burst
from
thebreast
—
then
she
spoke
,
and
her
words
thrilled
through
Jacob
Gary
likeliquid
fire
.
<EOS>
“Spare
,
oh
,
spare
him
!
”
<EOS>
she
said
;
“
he
is
my
father
—
my
own
father
.
<EOS>
Sparehim
;
<EOS>
oh
,
spare
—
<EOS>
spare—”She
awoke
not
even
in
her
agony
of
spirit
,
but
wept
bitterly
;
then
thetears
decreased
and
sobs
only
were
heard
;
the
vision
,
like
athunder
-
storm
,
was
passing
away
,
low
moans
succeeded
,
and
finally
allwas
still
again
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
however
,
many
minutes
before
Jacob
Gray
again
rose
from
hiscrouching
position
of
abject
fear
,
but
at
length
he
did
so
,
and
withthe
glittering
knife
in
his
hand
,
he
stood
within
a
pace
of
hisinnocent
victim
.
<EOS>
Then
arose
in
his
mind
the
awful
question
of
where
should
he
strike?And
,
like
a
vulture
,
he
hovered
for
a
time
over
his
prey
,
with
thefatal
steel
uplifted
,
doubting
where
he
should
make
the
sudden
swoop
.
<EOS>
By
an
accidental
parting
of
the
silken
curls
that
floated
upon
Ada’sneck
and
shoulders
,
he
saw
a
small
portion
of
her
breast
;
it
was
therethen
he
determined
to
strike
.
<EOS>
He
glanced
at
the
blade
of
the
knife
,
andhe
thought
it
long
enough
to
reach
even
to
her
heart
.
<EOS>
“Now
—
now
!
”
<EOS>
he
groaned
through
his
clenched
teeth
.
<EOS>
“
Now!”The
steel
was
uplifted
;
nay
,
it
was
upon
the
point
of
descending
,
whenone
heavy
knock
upon
the
outer
door
of
the
lone
house
<EOS>
echoed
throughthe
dreary
pile
,
and
arrested
the
arm
of
the
murderer
,
while
the
bloodrushed
in
terror
like
a
gush
of
cold
water
to
his
heart
.
<EOS>
There
was
then
an
awful
silent
pause
,
when
again
that
solemn
heavyknock
awakened
the
echoes
of
the
empty
house
.
<EOS>
Slowly
,
inch
by
inch
,
as
if
his
arm
worked
by
some
machinery
,
JacobGray
brought
the
knife
by
his
side
,
and
still
bending
over
theunconscious
Ada
,
he
listened
for
a
repetition
of
that
knock
,
as
if
eachmelancholy
blow
was
struck
upon
his
own
heart
.
<EOS>
Again
it
came
,
and
then
again
more
rapidly
,
and
Jacob
Gray
trembled
soviolently
that
he
was
fain
to
lean
upon
the
table
at
which
Ada
sleptfor
support
.
<EOS>
That
movement
awakened
Ada
,
and
starting
from
her
position
of
rest
,
shesuddenly
,
with
a
cry
of
surprise
,
confronted
the
man
who
had
sought
herchamber
with
<EOS>
so
fell
and
horrible
a
purpose
.
<EOS>
One
glance
at
the
knifewhich
Jacob
Gray
held
in
his
hand
,
and
then
a
searching
look
at
hisface
,
told
her
all
.
<EOS>
She
clasped
her
hands
in
terror
as
she
exclaimed—“You
—
you
—
come
to
kill
me?”“No
—
no
,
”
stammered
Gray
,
trying
to
smile
,
and
producing
his
usualpainful
distortion
of
features
.
<EOS>
“
No
—
no
—
I
did
—
not
—
no
—
no
!
<EOS>
Ada
,
I
did
not
.
<EOS>
”“That
knife
?
”
<EOS>
said
Ada
,
pointing
to
it
as
she
spoke
.
<EOS>
“The
knife
,
”
repeated
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
Hark
,
some
one
knocks
,
Ada
,
at
our
lonelyhome
.
”“Those
<EOS>
looks
of
terror
,
”
continued
the
young
girl
,
“
those
blanchedcheeks
,
those
trembling
hands
,
all
convince
me
that
I
have
escapeddeath
at
your
hands
.
<EOS>
”“No
<EOS>
;
I
say
no
,
”
gasped
Gray
.
<EOS>
“And
<EOS>
my
hound
too
,
”
added
Ada
:
“
my
fond
,
faithful
dog
,
<EOS>
where
is
he
,
uncle
Gray?”“Yes
;
<EOS>
the
dog
,
”
cried
Gray
,
eagerly
catching
at
the
hope
of
persuadingher
that
it
was
solely
to
compass
the
destruction
of
the
hound
he
hadthus
stolen
to
her
room
.
<EOS>
“
I
admit
I
did
seek
the
dog
’s
life
;
you
vexedme
about
the
animal
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
knocking
at
the
door
sounded
now
more
loudly
than
before
,
and
theknocker
was
evidently
plied
by
an
impatient
hand
.
<EOS>
“Hark
,
hark
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Gray
.
<EOS>
”
<EOS>
Ada
,
hear
me
;
whoever
knocks
without
can
beno
friend
of
ours
.
”“Indeed
?
”
<EOS>
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“’Tis
<EOS>
true
;
I
am
the
only
friend
you
have
in
the
wide
world
.
<EOS>
”“You
mean
,
I
suppose
,
since
you
have
killed
my
poor
dog
,
”
said
Ada
,
pointing
through
the
open
doorway
to
the
inanimate
body
of
the
animal
.
<EOS>
“The
dog
is
dead
,
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“Uncle
,
”
replied
Ada
,
mildly
,
but
firmly
<EOS>
;
“
now
hear
me
.
<EOS>
You
have
brokenthe

<EOS>
Let
those
who
knock
so
loudly
for
admission
enter

I
willnot

<EOS>
Were
they
ten
times
my

could
not

art

<EOS>
”“Ada
<EOS>
,
you
know
not
what

”
cried
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
They
can
not
be
friends
,
and
,
they
may
be
foes
.
’
<EOS>
Tis
light
enough
for
me
to
note
them
from
alower
window
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
will
see
,
I
will
see

<EOS>
Remain

<EOS>
Stirnot

<EOS>
”“I

said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“
You
shall
no
longer
prescribe
rules
ofconduct
for
me
,
uncle
Gray
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
I
will
promise
nothing

<EOS>
”Gray
made
an
impatient
gesture
with
his
hands
,
and
quitted
the
room
.
<EOS>
Herepaired
to
a
window
on
the
ground
floor
,
in
one
corner
of
which
he
hadmade
a
clear
spot
for
the
express
purpose
of
reconnoitering
thedoorway
,
and
applying
his
eye
now
close
to
this
,
he
could
by
the
dimlight
trace
the
forms
of
two
men
upon
his
threshold
.
<EOS>
Too
well
<EOS>
werethose
forms
engraven
on
his
memory
.
<EOS>
It
needed
not
a
second
glance
totell
him
that
the
savage
smith
,
Britton
,
and
Squire
Learmont
were
hisunwelcome
and
most
clamorous
visitors
.
<EOS>
Now
,
indeed
,
the
measure
of
Jacob
Gray
’s
agony
appeared
to
be
full
.
<EOS>
Fora
moment
he
completely
surrendered
himself
to
despair
;
and
had
Learmontthen
forced
the
door
,
he
would
scarcely
have
made
an
effort
to
escapethe
sword
of
the
man
of
blood
.
<EOS>
“Ha
!
<EOS>
Ha
!
”
<EOS>
he
heard
the
smith
say
;
“
I
like
to
knock
thus
,
it
alarmspoor
,
clever
,
cunning
Jacob
.
<EOS>
It
shatters
his
nerves
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
oh

oh!”“Can
you
depend
on
the
men
you
have
placed
at

said
Learmont
.

Oh

oh

how

shaking!”The
taunts
of
the
smith
seemed
to
act
as
a
stimulant
to
the
sickenedenergies
of
Gray
.
<EOS>
He
roused
himself
and
muttered
,
as
he
shook
hisclenched
hand
in

the
door—“Indeed

You

”He
<EOS>
bounded
up
the

to
the

in

he
had
left
Ada

Shewas
standing
by
the

“Ada

”Ada
<EOS>
only
pointed
to
the
door

<EOS>
Gray
was
thoroughly
alarmed
at
her
decisive
manner
,
and
another
loudknock
at
the
door
at
that
moment
did
not
tend
to
pacify

“There

The
perspiration
of
fear

intense
fear

was
standing
upon
the

ofGray

as
he
felt
that
each
fleeting

to

glanced
at

with

tremblinglimbs

stood
before

with

”With
<EOS>
a
loud
crash
at
this
moment
the
street

was
burst
from
itshinges

<EOS>
Gray
gave
one
frantic
scream

threw
himself
at
the
feet
of
Ada

<EOS>
“Save

shuddered
at
the

frantic
passion

<EOS>
She
struggled
tofree
herself
from

for
he
clung
to
her
with

<EOS>
“Mercy

<EOS>
Mercy

<EOS>
he
shrieked
.
<EOS>
In

she
retreated
backwards
from

he
crawled
after

on
hisknees

shrieking
“
Mercy

<EOS>
Mercy!”Now
Ada
had
gained
the
door
of
her

with
loathing

she
tried
in

to
disengage
herself
from

<EOS>
“They

<EOS>
Ah

springing

“Now

hear

“Yes

Iam

”For
<EOS>
an
instant
Ada
passed
her
hands
upon

eyes
,
as
if
to
shut
outthe
hideous
phantasma
of
a
dreadful
dream
,
and
then
,
with
a
cry
ofexquisite
anguish

she
rushed
through

folding
doors

closed

after

<EOS>
“That

gasped
Gray

wiping
from

the
coldperspiration
that
hung
there
in
bead

like
drops

<EOS>
“
The

rushed
to
the
door
of
the
room

led
to
the
staircase

in
amoment
locked
it

<EOS>
Then
he
stood
with
his

folded
,

an

smile
played
upon

awaiting

the

<EOS>
But
few
moments
remained
to
Jacob
Gray
for
sad
or
exultant
communionwith
his
own
thoughts
.
<EOS>
A
heavy
blow
from
without
dashed
the
door
open
,
and
Learmont
,
with
a
drawn
sword
in
his
hand
,
closely
followed
byBritton
,
carrying
a
lighted
link
,
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
“Well
met
;
Jacob
Gray

”
cried
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“
Your
cunning
is
now
at
fault

<EOS>
You
are
scarcely
a

you
thought
you

safely
in

”“Ho

Ho

<EOS>
sneered
Britton

holding
the
torch
close
to
the
pale

agitated
face
of

“

<EOS>
”“You

Learmont

“

”“Taunt

“
I

what

<EOS>
”“Well
<EOS>
you
know

cried
Learmont
,
angrily
,
“
you
had
a
double
hold
uponmy
fears

Jacob

but
that
double

So

but
no

<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
—
I
still
do
not

”
said
Gray
,
who
was
anxious
to
giveAda
some
time
to
complete
the
change
he
did
not
doubt
she
was
making
inher
apparel
.
<EOS>
“Ha

<EOS>
Ha
!
”
<EOS>
laughed
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“
It
were
a
thousand
pities
you
should
diein

trembling

Why

<EOS>
”“We

cried
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“
Where
is
the

the

cherub

cried
Britton

<EOS>
“He

not

said
Gray
,
with
as
much
boldness
as
he
could
assume
.
<EOS>
Learmont
gave
a
smile
of
contempt
as
he
said,—“Indeed
,
he
is
not
here
,
and
yet
Jacob
Gray
is
here

<EOS>
That
is
veryprobable

<EOS>
Now
I
tell

The

guarded

down

attempts

leave
it

<EOS>
Britton

I
came
inat
the
front

<EOS>
We
have
well
searched
the
lower
rooms
,
so
you
see
we
havetaken
our
measures
almost
as
cleverly
as
Jacob
Gray
took
his
when
hecame
to
Learmont
to
whisper
in
his
ear
<EOS>
that
the
boy
still
lived!”“Ho

<EOS>
roared
the
smith
,
patting
Gray
on
the
back

<EOS>
“
How

Master

<EOS>
Does

By

said
Gray

<EOS>
“Give

the

cried
Learmont
.
<EOS>
He
snatched
the
link
from
the
hand
of
Britton
,
and
made
two
stridestowards
the
inner
room
.
<EOS>
Gray
with
difficulty
suppressed
a
scream
of
alarm
,
but
before
Learmontcould
lay
hand
on
the
lock
,
Ada
flung
the
door
open
,
and
walkedcomposedly
forth

<EOS>
She
was
attired
in
a
plain
,
but
neat
girl
’s
dress

<EOS>
A
small
hooded
cloakwas
clasped
round
her
neck
;
and
now
that
she
was
attired
in
the
propercostume
of
her
sex
,
she
looked
several
years
older
,
and
the
change
inher
general
appearance
was
so
great
that
even
Jacob
Gray
would
scarcelyhave
recognised
her
.
<EOS>
She
showed
no
nervousness
,
no
haste
,
no
sign
of
trepidation
as
shestepped
from
the
room
,
and
her
voice
was
soft
,
and
musical
,
and
quitecalm
as
she
paused
and
said,—“Good
evening
,
Mr.
Gray
.
<EOS>
I
have
put
all
Harry

things
in

”Then
<EOS>
curtseying
to
Learmont
,
who
stood
almost
directly
in
her
way
,
shepassed
across
the
outer
room
,
and
disappeared
through
the
brokendoorway
.
<EOS>
For
several
minutes
not
a
word
was
spoken
by
either
of
the
three
menthere
assembled
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
what
precious
minutes
they
were
to
Jacob
Gray!Learmont
then
,
without
a
word
,
entered
the
inner
room
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
momentshe
returned
with
his
face
distorted
by
passion
,
and
placing
his
sword’spoint
against
the
throat
of
Gray
,
he
said,—“Where
is
the
boy?”“Not
here
—
on
my
soul
not
here
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Gray
,
trembling
with
fear
<EOS>
thatLearmont
<EOS>
’s
passion
might
get
the
better
of
his
prudence
,
and
that
byone
thrust
of
his
weapon
he
might
shed
his
life
blood
.
<EOS>
“Where
is
he?”“Where
<EOS>
is
he
?
”
<EOS>
echoed
Gray
,
to
whom
each
moment
gained
for
Adathoroughly
to
escape
,
was
equal
to
a
drop
of
blood
to
his
heart

<EOS>
“Answer
me
!

<EOS>
shrieked
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“I
repeat
the
boy
is
not
here

<EOS>
”“One
moment
more
I
give
you
,
”
added
Learmont
,
“
to
declare
to
me
<EOS>
wherethe

<EOS>
yet
a

Gray

<EOS>
“

”“No

cried
Learmont
,
“
that

do
no

It
is
not

hastrusted

<EOS>
”“You

laughed
Britton

<EOS>
“
Poor
Jacob
Gray
has
forgotten
even
to
lie—”“Exactly
,

snarled
Gray
,
“
because
the
truth
will
do
as
well

<EOS>
That
is
apiece
of
philosophy

the
muddled
brains
of
savage
Britton
wouldnever
have
conceived

<EOS>
”Britton
made
a
furious
rush
at
Gray
,
but
the
latter
stepped
behindLearmont
,
saying,—“It
is
still
the
interest
of
Squire
Learmont
toprotect

”“Hold

cried
Learmont

“
Stay

”“You

said
Gray

<EOS>
“
Our

trembled
as

slowly
dropped
the
point
of
his
sword

his
eyes
upon
Jacob

<EOS>
he
has
express

be

he

<EOS>
You
understand
my
position
,
Squire
Learmont
?
<EOS>
And
even
yourdull
-
pated
Britton
may
now
see
the
expediency
of
being
careful
of
yourdear
friend

Jacob
Gray

<EOS>
Fancy
any
delay
being
thrown
in
my
way
now
,
which
should
prevent
me
from
meeting
the
boy

<EOS>
How
disagreeable
it
wouldbe
to
me
to
see
hung
,
kind
Britton
,
while
I
had
my
free
pardon
in
mypocket
for
being
evidence
against
you
.
<EOS>
Do
you
understand?”There
was
a
most
remarkable
difference
in
the
expression
of
the
smith’scountenance
and
that
of
Learmont
’s
,
while
Gray
was
speaking
.
<EOS>
The
formerbecame
nearly
purple
with
suppressed
rage
,
while
the
squire
turned
ofan
ashy
,
ghastly
paleness
,
and
seemed
scarcely
equal
to
the
exertion
ofstanding
erect
.
<EOS>
“Gray
—
Jacob
Gray
,
”
he
gasped
.
<EOS>
“
You
do
not
—
you
can
not
mean
that
—
that—”“That
what
,
squire
?
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
Why
do
you
hesitate
?
<EOS>
I
will
answer
anyquestion
;
candidly
.
<EOS>
”“Have
<EOS>
you
,
”
continued
Learmont
,
“
indeed
set
all
our
lives
in
such
achance
as
your
meeting
a
boy
at
an
appointed
hour
in

great
city?”“I
have

answered
Gray
;
“

rather
I
should
say
you
have

<EOS>
”“Yes

Squire

,
you
thirst
for

<EOS>
You

so

<EOS>
Beware
!
<EOS>
I
say
,
and
giveup
the
chance!“Learmont
attempted
to
sheath
his
sword
,
but
his
hand
trembled
soexcessively
,
that
it
was
several
moments
before
he
could
accomplish
it
.
<EOS>
When
,
however
,
he
had
succeeded
,
he
turned
to
Gray
,
and
said,—“At
what
hour
—
are
—
you
to
meet
the
boy?”Gray
smiled
,
as
he
said,—“Perhaps
your
next
question
,
sir
,
may
be
where
I
am
to
meet
him?”“I
—
I
merely
asked
the
hour
.
”“Whatever
<EOS>
the
appointed
hour
may
be

”
said
Gray
,
“
be
assured
I
shallnot
meet

let
the
consequences
be
what
they
may

until
I
am

<EOS>
”“Let

Learmont

<EOS>
“Jacob

said
Britton
,
striding
up
to
him
,
and
grinding
his
wordsthrough
his
set
teeth
,
“
there
will
come
a
time
for
vengeance

<EOS>
”“Exactly
<EOS>

”
said
Gray
,
calmly
.
<EOS>
“An

come

I

<EOS>
”“You

Gray
;
“

”“Wretch

Britton

<EOS>
“Oh

Gray

half
drawing
a
knife
from

“

added
Gray

”“Come

Learmont

seizing
Britton
by
the

<EOS>
“Nay

sneered
Gray

<EOS>
“
Shall

’
<EOS>
Tis
some
distance
to
Westminster
.
<EOS>
Will
you
go
by
water
,
cunning
Britton?”Britton
<EOS>
’s
passion
was
too
great
for
utterance
,
and
he
walked
to
thedoor
,
which
he
kicked
open
with
a
violence
that
split
it
from
top
tobottom
.
<EOS>
“You
will
like
to
hear

Squire
Learmont

said
Gray
,
“

<EOS>
I
will
do
myself
the
honour

a

<EOS>
”Learmont
turned
at
the
door
,
and
cast
a
glance
at
Gray
,
that
even
hequailed
under

then
,
followed

CHAPTER
XXVI.The
<EOS>
Morning.—The
Body
of
the
Murdered
Man.—The
Old
Inn.—Jacob’sReflections
.
<EOS>
When
Learmont
and
the
smith
had
left
the
house
,
and
Jacob
Gray
feltthat
<EOS>
his
great
and
inevitable
danger
was
over
,
he
sunk
into
a
chair
,
and
a
fit
of
trembling
came
over
him
that
he
was
many
minutes
inrecovering
from
.
<EOS>
“They
are
foiled
this
once
,
”
he
muttered
;
“
but
they
may
not
beagain—’twas
a
rare
chance
,
a
most
rare
chance
,
I
—
I
must
leave
her
now
.
<EOS>
I
am
hunted
—
hunted
like
a
wild
animal
,
from
den
to
den
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
How
theywould
have
rejoiced
in
my
destruction
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
sad
life
tolead
—
and
—
and
if
,
before
they
came
,
I
had
taken
her
life
,
I
should
evennow
be
lying
a
stiffened
corpse
on
these
boards
—
yet
,
what
can
I
do
?
<EOS>
Sheis
my
torment
;
she
will
be
my
destruction!”He
then
rose
,
and
paced
the
room
for
some
time
with
hasty
and
unequalsteps
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
pausing
,
he
trembled
again
with
the
same
awfulintensity
that
he
had
done
before
,
and
in
a
hoarse
,
husky
whisper
,
said,—“What
if
she
come
not
back
?
<EOS>
She
suspects
me
.
<EOS>
It
is
time
she
were
hereagain
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
If
she
should
seek
protection
elsewhere
!
<EOS>
More
danger!—Moredanger!—Into
what
a
tangled
web
of
horrors
am
I
placed
!
<EOS>
Can
I
fly
?
<EOS>
Whatmoney
have
I
?
<EOS>
A
large
sum
,
but
yet
not
enough
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
If
Learmont
wouldgive
me
at
once
a
sum
of
money
which
would
suffice
me
in
a
foreignland
,
and
trust
my
word
to
go
,
and
if
I
could
trust
him
to
let
me
liveto
go
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
There
it
is!—There
<EOS>
it
is
!
<EOS>
We
can
not
trust
each
other
—
not
fora
moment
—
<EOS>
no
,
not
for
a
moment
.
”Jacob
<EOS>
Gray
muttered
these
gloomy
meditations
in
a
low
,
anxious
tone
,
and
almost
at
every
word
he
paused
to
endeavour
to
detect
some
token
ofthe
return
of
Ada
.
<EOS>
None
,
however
,
met
his
ears
,
and
,
after
two
hours
ofmental
agony
of
mind
had
thus
passed
over
the
head
of
Jacob
Gray
,
hecrept
down
the
staircase
,
and
stood
at
the
door
looking
anxiously
abouthim
by
the
dim
morning
light
that
was
beginning
,
with
its
cold
greytints
,
to
struggle
through
the
darkness
of
the
sky
.
<EOS>
“She
does
not
come
,
”
he
muttered—“she
does
not
come
.
<EOS>
What
shall
Ido
—
whither
seek
her
?
<EOS>
Yet
—
I
—
I
must
endeavour
to
find
her
.
”He
<EOS>
now
turned
his
attention
to
the
broken
lock
of
the
door
,
and
aftersome
time
,
succeeded
in
closing
it
after
him
tolerably
securely
,
thensearching
in
the
road
till
he
found
a
piece
of
chalk
<EOS>
,
he
wrote
on
thedoor,—“Wait
—
<EOS>
J.G.”“Should
she
return
during
my
absence
,
”
he
thought
,
“
she
will
recognisemy
writing
and
initials
to
wait
my
return
.
<EOS>
She
is
most
probably
near
athand
,
waiting
for
me
to
search
for
her
.
<EOS>
”Casting
again
<EOS>
a
cautious
,
scrutinising
glance
around
him
<EOS>
,
Jacob
Graywalked
slowly
down
the
ruined
street
,
peering
into
each
doorway
as
hewent
,
with
the
hope
of
seeing
Ada
.
<EOS>
His
search
was
unsuccessful
.
<EOS>
He
could
see
no
trace
of
Ada
;
and
athousand
feelings
of
alarm
and
suspicion
began
to
crowd
upon
his
mind
.
<EOS>
He
paused
irresolutely
at
the
end
of
the
street
,
uncertain
which
way
heshould
shape
his
course
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
with
a
sudden
resolution
,
he
walkedin
the
direction
of
Westminster
Bridge
.
<EOS>
As
he
neared
Lambeth
,
he
observed
that
the
watermen
,
who
plied
at
thedifferent
stairs
by
the
side
of
the
river
,
seemed
particularlyengrossed
by
some
subject
of
importance
,
for
they
were
congregatedtogether
in
knots
of
two
,
three
,
and
four
,
discoursing
earnestly
andvehemently
.
<EOS>
He
approached
one
,
and
touching
his
arm
<EOS>
,
said,—“What
is
the
matter
,
friend?”“Murder
’s
the
matter
,
”
replied
the
man
.
<EOS>
“Murder!”“Ay
,
murder
.
<EOS>
There
has
been
a
murder
done
in
the
Bishop
’s
Walk
.
”“In
<EOS>
the
Bishop
’s
Walk?”“Yes
<EOS>
;
the
body
was
found
cold
and
stiff
—
the
body
of
a
waterman
;
but
wewill
have
justice
.
<EOS>
”“What
<EOS>
was
his
name
?
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“Sheldon
.
<EOS>
He
plied
at
the
bridge
stairs
opposite
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
thank
you
,
friend
,
”
said
Gray
,
as
he
walked
on
muttering
to
himself,—“Now
,
I
’d
lay
my
life
<EOS>
this
murder
is
Britton
’s
doing
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
if
I
couldfix
him
with
it
—
and
yet
there
might
be
danger
.
<EOS>
At
the
gallows
he
mightdenounce
me
—
yes
,
he
would
.
<EOS>
It
must
have
been
by
means
of
this
mansomehow
that
my
retreat
was
so
quickly
discovered
—
yet
how
,
I
cannotdivine
.
”He
<EOS>
now
observed
a
small
public
-
house
,
at
the
door
of
which
was
a
throngof
persons
,
and
pressing
forward
,
he
soon
learned
that
there
the
bodyof
the
murdered
man
lay
.
<EOS>
Impelled
by
a
curiosity
that
he
could
not
resist
,
Gray
entered
thehouse
,
and
calling
for
some
liquor
,
commenced
a
conversation
with
thelandlord
,
which
somewhat
altered
his
opinion
concerning
the
murderer
.
<EOS>
“I
saw
Sheldon
,
”
said
the
host
,
“
and
intend
to
swear
to
it
solemnly
,
pass
my
house
at
an
unusual
hour
in
company
with
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
I
waslooking
out
to
see
the
state
of
the
night
when
I
saw
them
pass
ontowards
the
Bishop
’s
Walk
.
<EOS>
”“What
<EOS>
kind
of
man
was
he
with
?
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“A
tall
man
.
<EOS>
”“Thin
<EOS>
and
dark?”“Nay
,
as
for
his
complexion
I
can
say
nothing
,
for
in
the
dark
,
youknow
,
all
cats
are
grey
.
”“True
<EOS>
;
but
you
could
swear
to
the
man
being
tall
and
thin
,
MasterLandlord?”“In
faith
I
could
,
and
<EOS>
your
tall
,
thin
men
are
just
what
I
dislike

bah!They
<EOS>
seldom
drink
much

<EOS>
”“Most
<EOS>
true
—
I
thank
you

<EOS>
Tis
a
barbarous
murder
.
”“Would
<EOS>
you
like
,
sir
,
to
see
the
corpse

”
said
the
landlord
,
in
anunder
tone
.
<EOS>
“The
corpse
?
”
echoed
Gray
.
<EOS>
“Ay
<EOS>
;
he
was
a
fine
fellow

<EOS>
You
must
know
that
Sir

He

<EOS>
”“Yes

said
Gray
,
abstractedly
.
<EOS>
“He

continued
the
loquacious
landlord
,
“

said
the

placing

keeping
up

Jacob

entered
after

closed

“Now

”A
<EOS>
stream
of
light
came
from
the
partially
unclosed
shutter

and
Graysaw
the
corpse
of
the
man
whom
he
had
tempted
to
commit
a
murder
uponBritton
himself
,
lying
cold
and
stark
in
the
bloody
embrace
of
death

<EOS>
The
body
lay
upon
a
table
,
and
the
warmth
of
the
house
had
caused
thewound
to
bleed
slightly
again

<EOS>
The
face
was
ghastly

pale

gave

awful
appearance

XXVII.Ada
’s
Flight
and
Despair.—Old
Westminster
Bridge
at
Daybreak.—TheSmith.—Mad
Maud
.
<EOS>
When
Ada
,
the
beautiful
and
persecuted
child
of
the
dead
,
passed
fromthe
room
in
the
garments
befitting
her
sex
,
she
thought
her
heart
mustburst
with
the
suppressed
feelings
which
were
conjured
up
in
its
inmostrecesses
.
<EOS>
One
awful
question
occurred
to
her
to
be
traced
in
letters
ofliquid
fire
upon
her
brain
,
and
that
was
:
“
Is
it
true
that
Jacob
Grayis
my
father
?
”
<EOS>
His
assertion
of
the
fact
had
come
upon
her
<EOS>
so
entirelyunawares
that
,
as
Gray
had
himself
exultingly
supposed
,
she
had
nottime
to
think
—
but
the
doubt
—
the
merest
suspicion
that
it
might
true
,
was
madness
.
<EOS>
Ada
did
not
—
she
could
not
,
even
at
the
moment
that
Graydeclared
himself
her
father
,
believe
his
words
;
but
still
the
doubt
wasraised
,
and
although
all
reason
—
all
probability
—
all
experience
gave
thelie
to
the
assertion
,
there
was
still
the
awful
intrusive
thought
thatit
might
be
so
.
<EOS>
Upon
the
impulse
of
that
small
possibility
,
that
in
that
moment
ofdespair
and
agony
of
soul
Jacob
Gray
had
spoken
truly
,
Ada
acted
.
<EOS>
Shecould
not
run
the
dreadful
risk
of
sacrificing
even
a
brutal
andcriminal
father
,
and
with
a
speed
that
in
her
state
of
mind
wasmarvellous
,
she
altered
herself
,
in
her
girl
’s
clothing
,
and
,
as
wehave
seen
,
for
the
time
,
saved
Jacob
Gray
from
death
.
<EOS>
As
she
descended
the
narrow
,
dilapidated
staircase
,
she
pressed
herhands
convulsively
upon
her
heart
to
still
its
tumultuous
beatings
.
<EOS>
Herposition
in
life
appeared
to
her
to
be
all
at
once
strangely
altered
.
<EOS>
If
—
<EOS>
and
oh
!
<EOS>
That
horrid
<EOS>
if,—if
<EOS>
conveying
as
it
did
a
possibility
of
thefact
<EOS>
—
if
Jacob
Gray
was
really
her
father!—What
was
she
now
to
do?—Howthink
of
him?—How
address
him
?
<EOS>
Could
she
ever
bestow
upon
him
thesmallest
fraction
of
that
dear
love
which
flows
in
so
easy
and
naturala
current
from
a
child
to
its
parent
?
<EOS>
Could
she
call
him
father?—No
<EOS>
,
she
felt
that
she
could
not
.
<EOS>
She
examined
her
feelings
to
endeavour
todetect
some
yearnings
of
natural
love
and
duty
—
some
of
that
undefined
,
mysterious
instinct
she
had
read
of
as
enabling
the
parent
to
singleout
the
child
—
the
child
the
parent
,
from
the
great
mass
of
humanity;but
<EOS>
the
search
—
the
self
-
examination
was
in
vain
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
was
to
herbut
the
cruel
,
vindictive
tyrant
,
rioting
in
oppression
and
brutalitywhen
un
-
resisted
,
and
shrinking
from
her
like
a
beaten
hound
when
shedared
to
confront
him
,
and
question
his
acts
.
<EOS>
“God
of
Heaven
!
”
<EOS>
she
said
,
when
she
had
reached
the
street
;
“
thereshould
be
some
similarity
of
thought
,
some
community
of
feeling
betweena
father
and
his
child
.
<EOS>
Do
I
and
Jacob
Gray
think
alike
in
anything?Have
<EOS>
we
one
feeling
in
common?—No,—not
one
.
<EOS>
”As
<EOS>
the
probabilities
of
his
not
being
her
father
crowded
upon
her
mind
,
now
that
the
intense
excitement
of
the
minute
was
over
,
Ada
became
morehappy
and
composed
,
and
she
slackened
her
pace
,
seeing
that
she
hadalready
placed
a
considerable
distance
between
herself
and
the
housewhich
had
been
to
her
a
prison
for
so
long
a
period
.
<EOS>
“I
will
not
,
can
not
believe
it
,
”
she
said
to
herself
;
“
that
man
is
nofather
of
mine
.
’
<EOS>
Twas
a
trick
—
a
master
-
stroke
in
the
extremity
of
hisfortunes
to
bend
me
to
his
wishes
,
for
some
reasons
which
I
know
not
,
and
can
not
even
hazard
the
wildest
guess
of
.
<EOS>
My
father
?
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
,
myfather
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
no
,
no
,
no
!
<EOS>
Rather
never
let
me
look
upon
a
father
’s
face
,
than
feel
assured
of
such
a
horror
as
that
!
<EOS>
It
cannot
—
cannot
be
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
what
would
I
not
give
to
be
assured
of
the
lie
!
<EOS>
Had
<EOS>
I
worlds
of
richesin
my
grasp
<EOS>
,
I
would
unloose
my
hold
and
let
them
fly
from
me
to
beassured
,
past
all
doubt
—
past
all
hesitation
,
that
Jacob
Gray
was
to
meneither
father
nor
uncle
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
dank
fog
that
hung
upon
the
Thames
was
now
slowly
clearing
frombefore
the
face
of
heaven
,
and
by
the
time
Ada
had
reached
WestminsterBridge
,
she
could
see
through
several
breaks
in
the
sky
,
glimpses
ofthe
starry
host
looking
down
upon
the
rapidly
departing
night
.
<EOS>
The
excitement
the
young
girl
had
gone
through
had
hitherto
supportedher
against
the
intense
coldness
of
the
raw
air
,
but
now
she
trembledin
every
limb
,
and
as
she
stood
upon
the
silent
bridge
,
trying
topierce
with
her
dark
,
lustrous
eyes
,
the
heavy
fog
,
and
to
catch
aglimpse
of
the
rushing
stream
below
,
she
felt
the
cold
to
her
veryheart
,
and
all
the
miseries
of
her
homeless
,
friendless
situation
,
rushing
at
once
like
a
full
tide
upon
her
mind
<EOS>
,
she
shrank
into
one
ofthe
little
alcoves
of
the
bridge
,
and
sinking
upon
the
rude
woodenseat
,
she
burst
into
tears
,
and
sobbed
aloud
in
the
deep
anguish
of
herheart
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
then
she
started
to
her
feet
,
as
she
heard
a
heavy
footstepapproaching
.
<EOS>
Her
first
impulse
was
to
leave
her
place
of
refuge
,
andwalk
quickly
onwards
,
but
a
second
thought
caused
her
to
shrink
back
,
with
the
hope
that
the
stranger
would
pass
on
,
and
she
should
escapehis
observation
.
<EOS>
Nearer
and
nearer
<EOS>
she
heard
the
heavy
measured
tread
approaching
,
andan
undefinable
sensation
of
fear
crept
over
her
as
the
sounds
echoedfrom
one
side
of
the
old
bridge
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
Now
and
then
the
person
,
whoever
it
was
,
would
pause
in
his
walk
,
andindistinct
mutterings
,
as
if
he
were
communing
with
himself
,
reachedthe
ears
of
Ada
.
<EOS>
As
he
came
near
she
could
detect
the
words
he
used
,
and
her
ears
wereshocked
by
oaths
of
the
most
awful
character
,
coupled
with
invectivesand
horrible
imprecations
against
some
one
.
<EOS>
Involuntarily
Ada
shrankstill
closer
within
the
alcove
,
and
now
the
stranger
paused
nearlyopposite
to
where
she
was
concealed
,
and
she
could
hear
his
wordsdistinctly
.
<EOS>
“Curses
<EOS>
on
him
,
”
he
muttered
;
“
I
swear
,
I
,
Andrew

by
allthe
furies
of

that
I

By

<EOS>
”There
was
now
a
dead
silence
for
some
moments
,
and
Ada
strove
torecollect
where
and
when
she
had
heard
that
voice
before
.
<EOS>
“Can
<EOS>
this
be
one
of
those
from

visits
my

from
in

much
terror

<EOS>
It
surely
is

else
Ihave
heard
his
voice
in
some
dream

<EOS>
Ha

<EOS>
He
comes
—
<EOS>
he
comes!”Britton
<EOS>
,
for
it
was
he
,
advanced
a
pace
or
two
and
leaned
upon
theparapet
of
the
bridge
,
still
muttering
deep
and
awful
curses
.
<EOS>
He
was
soclose
to
Ada
that
she
could
have
touched
him
with
her
small
white
hand
,
had
she
chosen
,
but
she
stilled
the
very
beating
of
her
heart
as
muchas
possible
,
in
instinctive
terror
of
that
man
.
<EOS>
“It
’s
all
to
do
over
again
now
,
”
he
said
:
“
all
over
again
—
with
theadditional
difficulty
that
he
is
upon
his
guard
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
could
I

lighton

I
—
<EOS>
I’d
<EOS>
wring
his
neck
—
and
then
—
then
Jacob

I
wouldinvent
some
method

burning
you

death
painfully
;
some
method
thatwould
take
long
in
doing
this

—
I
should
see
you
writhe
in
your
agony

<EOS>
Bythe

there
’s
<EOS>
comfort
in
the
thought

<EOS>
Oh
,
that
I
had
him
here
—
hereclinging
to
the
parapet

bridge
while
I
—
I
,
Andrew
Britton
,
wasslowly
—
yes
,
very
slowly
,
sawing
his
fingers
till
he
loosed
his
hold
andfell
.
<EOS>
Then
he
would
strike
against
yon
projection
.
<EOS>
Ha

<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
That
wouldbe
one
pang
—
I
should
hear

shriek

<EOS>
Then
down
—
down
hewould
go
into

mingling
his

He
—
a
step
<EOS>
—

strange
wild
voice
was
now
heard
singing
in
a
kind
of
rude
chaunt
.
<EOS>
The
tones
were
feeble
and
broken
,
but
Ada
,
with
a
feeling
of
pleasure
,
recognised
in
them
those
of
a
woman
.
<EOS>
Her
attention
,
however
,
was
in
amoment
again
turned
to
Britton
,
who
all
at
once
exclaimed
,
“
What
voiceis

that
?
<EOS>
I
—
<EOS>
I
know
that
voice
,
although
I
have
not
heard
it
for
sometime
now

<EOS>
”The
voice
became
more
distinct
as
the
singer
approached
,
and
there
wasa
wild
earnestness
in
the
manner
in
which
the
following
words
werespoken
,
which
touched
Ada
to
the
heart:—“The
winter

”“Now

he
could
decide
upon

the
poor

wasclose
to

and
when
he
said
he
did
not
,
I
described
you
tohim
,
that
he
might
recognise
you
,
when
his
cold
clammy
hands
,
are
aboutyour
<EOS>
neck!”“Prating
idiot
!
”
said
Britton
,
“
if
you
tempt
me
to
the
deed
,
I
’ll
castyou
over
the
bridge!”“You
dare
not
,
Andrew
Britton
!
<EOS>
You
dare
not
,
”
cried
Maud
.
<EOS>
“
Savage
asyou
are
,
you
dare
not
do
that
!
<EOS>
Strange
,
too
,
as
you
boast
yourself
,
youcould
not!”“Indeed
!
“
answered
Britton
.
<EOS>
“
Now
,
by
Heaven—”“Hold
—
hold
!
<EOS>
Whatever
you
do
,
swear
not
by
<EOS>
Heaven;—that
Heaven
you
willnever
see
!
<EOS>
What
have
you
to
do
with
Heaven
,
that
you
should
record
yourblustering
oaths
in
its
pure
annals
?
<EOS>
Swear
not
by
Heaven
,
AndrewBritton
,
or
<EOS>
you
may
provoke
a
vengeance
that
may
be
terrible
even
toyou
.
<EOS>
”“Tell
<EOS>
me
,
”
said
Britton
,
in
an
evidently
assumed
tone
of
mildness,“what
brought
you
to
London?”“A
holier
errand
,
Britton
,
than
that
which
has
brought
you
,
God
knows
Icame
to
save
,
but
you
came
to
destroy
.
<EOS>
”“Save
<EOS>
who?”“The
child
!
<EOS>
The
child!”“You
speak
in
riddles
,
Maud
.
<EOS>
What
child?”“I
am
mad
!
”
<EOS>
replied
the
woman
.
<EOS>
“
I
know
I
am
mad
,
but
I
have
notforgotten
—
no
,
no
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
how
long
ago
it
is
,
but
I
saw
the
childof
the
dead
brought
forth
by
the
bleeding
man!”“You
rave
,
”
cried
Britton
.
<EOS>
“No
—
<EOS>
no
;
I
had
no
clue
to
that
young
child
.
<EOS>
To
wander
in
search
of
itwas
hopeless
till
—
till
I
found
that
you
,
Andrew
Britton
,
were
on
themove
.
<EOS>
So
long
as
the
sound
of
your
hammer
rose
on
the
night
air
atLearmont
,
I
stayed
there,—I
hovered
round
your
dwelling
.
<EOS>
”“You
played
the
spy
upon
me
?
”
<EOS>
cried
Britton
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
did
—
I
did
;
and
wherefore
should
I
not
?
<EOS>
I
have
followed
you
to
thiscity
.
<EOS>
You
came
to
seek
the
child
;
so
have
I.
<EOS>
But
you
came
quickly
,
withgold
to
urge
you
on
your
way
;
I
have
been
many
weeks
begging
from
doorto
door
.
<EOS>
I
asked
two
things
wherever
I
went
;
one
was
a
morsel
of
brokenbread
,
and
the
other
was
to
place
my
face
towards
London
;
<EOS>
now
I
amhere,—here
,
Britton
<EOS>
,
I
came
to
save
the
child
.
”“Wretch
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Britton
;
“
if
your
madness
may
be
feigned
for
all
Iknow
.
<EOS>
Swear
to
me
that
you
will
at
once
,
return
to
Learmont
.
<EOS>
”“Return?”“Ay
<EOS>
;
you
shall
not
dog
my
steps
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
you
mean
.
<EOS>
You
rave
,
woman
—
you
rave
.
<EOS>
”“Do
<EOS>
I
rave
?
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
perhaps
’
tis
true
.
<EOS>
But
I
saw
the
child
.
<EOS>
”“Tell
<EOS>
me
one
thing
,
Maud
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
who
that
child
is?”There
was
a
pause
of
a
moment
and
<EOS>
Ada
’s
heart
beat
with
tumultuousemotion
,
as
she
thought
that
now
she
might
hear
by
this
strangeaccidental
meeting
the
secret
of
her
birth
.
<EOS>
“Yes
,
”
said
Maud
;
“
yes
—
I
know
.
<EOS>
”“You
are
sure
,
”
said
Britton
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
know
,
I
know
,
”
repeated
Maud
.
<EOS>
“Then
,
if
there
is
a
heaven
above
us
,
or
a
hell
beneath
us
,
”
criedBritton
,
“
you
shall
not
leave
this
bridge
alive
.
<EOS>
”“Hush
—
hush
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Mad
Maud
,
“
I
have
dreamt
it
often
,
and
believe
it
.
<EOS>
You
are
to
die
before
I
do
;
it
is
so
arranged
,
Andrew
Britton
.
<EOS>
”Ada
looked
out
with
trembling
apprehension
from
her
place
ofconcealment
,
and
she
saw
,
by
the
rapidly
increasing
light
of
the
comingday
,
the
savage
smith
casting
rapid
glances
around
,
as
if
to
assurehimself
that
no
one
was
within
sight
of
the
deed
of
blood
<EOS>
he
was
aboutto
commit
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
an
awful
apathy
crept
over
the
heart
of
Ada
,
and
she
felt
as
if
she
were
condemned
to
crouch
in
that
little
alcovewithout
power
of
voice
or
action
,
and
see
the
murder
committed
.
<EOS>
Mad
Maud
did
not
appear
to
have
comprehended
the
last
muttered
threatof
Britton
,
for
she
stood
with
her
arms
folded
across
her
breast
,
murmuring
in
a
low
tone
to
herself
,
and
apparently
unheedful
even
ofthe
presence
of
her
enemy
.
<EOS>
Ada
then
saw
the
smith
fumble
awhile
in
hisbreast
,
and
then
he
drew
forth
a
knife
.
<EOS>
She
saw
it
glitter
in
the
faintlight
.
<EOS>
“Yes
,
yes
,
”
said
Maud
,
in
a
low
tone
,
“
I
recollect
all
,
or
nearly
all
.
<EOS>
How
difficult
it
is
to
separate
the
dreams
from
the
reality
.
<EOS>
The
spiritof
the
dead
man
still
haunts
the
place
!
<EOS>
Yes
;
that
is
real
!
<EOS>
He
cries
forhis
<EOS>
child!—His
little
<EOS>
child!—And
there
is
a
garb
on
his
breast
!
<EOS>
Let
methink
.
<EOS>
How
has
he
lived
so
long
after
his
murder
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes
—
I
know
now
:
it
is
by
drinking
the
blood
continually
from
his
own
wounds
!
<EOS>
Ay
,
thatwould
preserve
him!”Britton
made
a
step
towards
her
.
<EOS>
“The
child
!
”
<EOS>
she
cried
suddenly
.
<EOS>
“You
<EOS>
shall
torment
me
no
longer
,
”
he
cried
.
<EOS>
“Ha
!
”
<EOS>
shrieked
Maud
,
as
she
saw
the
knife
uplifted
,
<EOS>
“
you
darenot
—
<EOS>
cannot
do
it!”She
shrank
back
,
but
Britton
followed
close
upon
her
<EOS>
,
Ada
again
saw
theknife
uplifted
,
and
by
a
violent
effort
,
like
a
person
recovering
froma
nightmare
,
she
screamed
.
<EOS>
The
sound
seemed
to
Britton
so
great
a
surprise
,
that
he
staggered
,
<EOS>
anddropped
the
knife
from
his
trembling
hand
.
<EOS>
Her
own
voice
appeared
to
have
broken
the
spell
of
horror
that
bound
upthe
faculties
of
Ada
,
and
now
,
by
an
impulse
which
lent
her
strengthand
courage
,
she
rushed
from
the
place
of
concealment
,
and
,
snatchingthe
knife
from
the
ground
,
she
fled
quickly
along
the
bridge
,
crying,“Help!—Help!”She
had
not
proceeded
many
paces
when
she
was
caught
in
the
arms
<EOS>
ofsome
one
who
cried,—“Hilloa!—hilloa
!
<EOS>
What
now
,
little
one?”“Help!—Murder
on
the
bridge
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Ada
.
<EOS>
“
Oh!—Haste!—Haste!—Save
thewoman!”It
was
the
watchman
going
his
rounds
,
and
he
hurried
onwards
,
as
fastas
his
chilled
limbs
would
permit
him
,
towards
the
spot
indicated
byAda
,
who
closely
followed
him
.
<EOS>
“He
has
killed
her
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Ada
,
as
she
saw
Maud
lying
apparentlylifeless
on
the
stones
.
<EOS>
“Murder
done
!
”
<EOS>
cried
the
watchman
.
<EOS>
Ada
cast
an
anxious
glance
around
her
,
and
she
thought
that
at
thefurther
extremity
of
the
bridge
she
caught
sight
of
the
flying
figureof
<EOS>
the
man
who
she
believed
had
done
the
deed
.
<EOS>
“There
!
”
<EOS>
she
said
,
pointing
in
the
direction—“Pursue
him!—There
fliesthe
<EOS>
murderer!”The
watchman
immediately
threw
down
the
lantern
,
and
with
a
greatclattering
of
his
iron
-
shod
shoes
,
rushed
across
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
“Alas!—Alas
!
”
cried
Ada
,
clasping
her
hands
.
<EOS>
“
What
can
all
this
mean?Who
is
this
poor
mad
creature?—And
who
that
fearful
man
?
<EOS>
The
mystery
inwhich
my
birth
,
name
,
and
fate
is
involved
,
grows
more
and
moreinexplicable
.
<EOS>
Was
it
of
me
<EOS>
she
talked
so
strangely
and
so
wildly
?
<EOS>
Oh!If
<EOS>
she
could
but
breathe
to
me
one
word
,
to
assure
me
that
Jacob
Graywas
not
my
father
,
how
richly
would
the
terrors
of
this
fearful
nightbe
repaid!”Ada
knelt
by
the
body
of
Maud
as
she
spoke
,
and
placed
her
hand
overher
heart
,
to
endeavour
to
trace
some
sign
of
vitality
.
<EOS>
“She
lives
—
she
lives
!
”
<EOS>
suddenly
cried
Ada
,
as
she
felt
the
regularbeating
of
the
organ
of
life
.
<EOS>
“
Perchance
the
villain
has
only
struckher
.
<EOS>
He
may
not
,
after
casting
away
his
knife
,
have
had
the
means
ofharming
her
very
seriously
.
<EOS>
”A
<EOS>
deep
groan
now
came
from
the
lips
of
the
insensible
woman
.
<EOS>
“Speak
—
<EOS>
oh
,
speak
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Ada
.
<EOS>
Maud
opened
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
They
glared
with
the
wild
fire
of
insanity
on
Ada
.
<EOS>
“Do
<EOS>
you
know
me
?
”
said
the
girl
.
<EOS>
“Know
you?—Know
you
?
<EOS>
Are
you
an
angel
or
a
devil?”“Alas
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Ada
.
<EOS>
“
There
is
no
hope
.
<EOS>
”Maud
<EOS>
passed
her
hand
across
her
eyes
for
several
moments
as
if
tryingto
clear
the
mist
that
beset
her
memory
and
mental
faculties
.
<EOS>
Then
shesaid,—“Where
is
he?”“The
man
you
were
talking
with?”“Yes
,
Britton
,
the
savage
smith
of
Learmont
.
<EOS>
”“He
has
fled
.
<EOS>
”“Yes
<EOS>
—
yes
—
fled
.
<EOS>
He
was
pursued
by
the
dead
man
asking
for
his
child
.
<EOS>
”“What
child
?
<EOS>
”
said
Ada
,
in
a
voice
trembling
with
anxiety
.
<EOS>
“I
saw
its
little
arms
cling
round
its
father
’s
murderer
.
<EOS>
I
heard
himshriek
<EOS>
—
I
heard
him
say
the
hell
of
conscience
had
began
its
awful
workwithin
his
guilty
breast
.
<EOS>
”“The
child
—
the
child
,
”
cried
<EOS>
Ada,—“what
was
its
name
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
tell
me
,
ifyou
can
,
its
name?”“Its
name
,
”
repeated
Maud
.
<EOS>
“
It
was
the
child
of
the
dead
.
<EOS>
It
—
itreminded
me
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
Listen
!
<EOS>
When
I
was
young
—
for
I
was
youngonce
—
and
my
hair
hung
in
long
silken
rights
from
my
brow
,
when
my
eyesdanced
in
the
pure
light
of
heaven
,
and
my
heart
mounted
with
joy
,
singing
like
the
lark
that
carries
its
sweet
notes
even
to
the
gates
ofheaven
.
<EOS>
Long
—
long
ago
I
clasped
to
my
breast
such
a
dear
child
as
that
.
<EOS>
So
you
see
it
reminded
me
of
my
own
dear
infant
.
<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
you
knew
not
its
name
?
”
<EOS>
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“Its
<EOS>
name!—No
,
I
can
not
tell
you
its
name
!
<EOS>
but
I
will
tell
you
a
dream
.
”“Answer
<EOS>
me
one
question
,
”
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“
The
child
,
I
heard
you
say
,
youcame
to
London
to
save
.
<EOS>
Was
its
name
Gray?”“Gray
—
Gray
.
<EOS>
Who
is
Gray?”“There
is
hope
even
,
”
sighed
Ada
,
“
in
the
want
of
confirmation
of
aterrible
doubt
.
<EOS>
If
I
am
the
child
she
raves
so
strangely
of
<EOS>
,
she
knowsme
not
by
that
most
hateful
name
.
<EOS>
”“Will
<EOS>
you
hear
my
dream
?
”
<EOS>
said
Maud
,
endeavouring
to
rise
from
the
coldstones
.
<EOS>
Ada
saw
that
blood
was
trickling
from
her
head
,
but
whether
she
hadstruck
it
in
falling
,
or
the
man
who
had
attempted
her
destruction
hadinflicted
the
wound
,
was
doubtful
.
<EOS>
Ada
,
however
,
assisted
her
to
herfeet
,
and
as
she
did
so
<EOS>
she
heard
the
tread
of
the
watchman
as
hereturned
slowly
from
his
pursuit
.
<EOS>
“He
<EOS>
’s
off
,
”
cried
the
man
.
<EOS>
“
Hilloa!—Ain’t
the
woman
dead?”“Dead
!
”
<EOS>
shrieked
Maud
,
suddenly
confronting
the
watchman
,
“
is
AndrewBritton
dead?”“Who?”“Andrew
Britton
,
the
savage
smith
;
because
he
is
to
die
before
me
.
<EOS>
Ha!Ha
!
<EOS>
Yes
,
Andrew
Britton
will
die
before
I
do
.
<EOS>
”With
<EOS>
wild
laughter
she
flew
rather
than
ran
across
the
bridge
in
thedirection
of
Lambeth
,
and
her
voice
echoed
in
the
still
morning
air
,
asshe
shrieked,—“Andrew
Britton
—
Andrew
Britton
—
I
am
not
dead!—Not
dead
<EOS>
yet!”The
watchman
stared
after
her
in
amazement
,
and
Ada
took
theopportunity
,
while
he
was
thus
fully
engaged
,
of
walking
quicklyonwards
until
she
had
cleared
the
bridge
and
the
solemn
spires

ofWestminster

came
upon

CHAPTER
XXVIII.Ada
’s
<EOS>
Wanderings.—The
<EOS>
Pearl
Necklace.—A
Kind
Heart.—The
Park.—A
JoyousMeeting.—The
Arrangement
.
<EOS>
Cold
and
hunger
now
began
to
exercise
a
sensible
influence
upon
thefragile
frame
of
Ada
.
<EOS>
Her
step
became
languid
and
slow
,
and
she
beganto
feel
that
her
strength
was
fast
deserting
her
.
<EOS>
Her
dislike
to
returnto
Jacob
Gray
was
very
great
,
and
yet
where
else
in
that
great
citycould
she
find
a
place
whereon
to
lay
her
aching
limbs
?
<EOS>
The
sense
ofher
own
extreme
destitution
came
vividly
across
her
imagination
,
andhad
it
not
been
for
the
curious
gaze
of
the
early
passengers
she
met
,
she
could
have
wept
freely
in
her
bitterness
of
heart
.
<EOS>
Listlessly
shewalked
onwards
,
and
thought
,
from
its
very
intensity
,
became
at
last
apositive
pain
.
<EOS>
Money
she
had
none
;
and
,
in
fact
,
so
secluded
from
theworld
had
she
been
kept
by
the
fears
of
Jacob
Gray
,
that
she
would
nothave
known
how
to
procure
the
means
of
supporting
life
,
even
had
shepossessed
valuable
property
about
her
.
<EOS>
A
cold
,
glaring
winter
’s
sun
shone
forth
from
a
clear
sky
,
mocking
theearth
with
an
appearance
of
warmth
,
which
made
the
sharp
wind
thatwhistled
round
the
corners
of
the
streets
seem
doubly
keen
and
piercing
.
<EOS>
“Must
<EOS>
I
return
to
that
dismal
house
?
”
<EOS>
thought
Ada—“must
I
again
throwmyself
on
the
mercy
of
that
man
who
calls
himself
my
father?”She
paused
in
doubt
and
irresolution
,
and
no
one
who
passed
could
failto
mark
the
air
of
deep
dejection
which
sat
upon
the
pale
anxious
faceof
the
young
girl
.
<EOS>
It
so
chanced
that
she
stopped
opposite
to
the
shop
-
door
of
a
jewellerand
dealer
in
precious
stones

in
Parliament
-
street
,
and
as
she
clungto
the
little
wooden
rail
that
guarded
the
window
<EOS>
,
she
saw
the
keen
,
sparkling
eyes
of
an
old
man
fixed
on
her
from
within
.
<EOS>
His
beard
andgeneral
appearance
proclaimed
him
a
Jew
,
and
scarcely
had
Ada
shrankfrom
his
gaze
,
and
paused
a
step
or
two
onwards
,
when
she
heard
a
voicebehind
her
saying,—“My
dear
,
will
you
sell
that
necklace?”Ada
turned
quickly
.
<EOS>
The
old
man
from
the
shop
stood
before
her
,
andrepeated
his
question
.
<EOS>
“Will
you
sell
that
necklace?”“Necklace
?
”
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“Yes
;
the
little
necklace
you
have
round
your
pretty
little
neck
,
mydear
.
<EOS>
”Ada
<EOS>
now
recollected
that
among
her
female
attire
she
had
found
thenecklace
;
and
hastily
clasped
it
on
when
dressing
,
to
elude
the
searchof
Jacob
Gray
’s
furious
visitors
.
<EOS>
“I
am
tired
and
hungry
,
”
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“Are
<EOS>
you
indeed
.
<EOS>
Bless
me
!
”
<EOS>
cried
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
“
Walk
into
my
shop
.
<EOS>
Yousee
I
am
an
old
man
.
<EOS>
Walk
in
—
<EOS>
do
walk
in
.
<EOS>
”Ada
<EOS>
suffered
herself
to
be
led
into
the
little
shop
,
and
unclasping
thenecklace
,
she
said—“Will
<EOS>
it
fetch
me
a
meal?”“A
meal
?
”
said
the
jeweller
,
and
his
eyes
sparkled
as
he
took
thenecklace
.
<EOS>
“
A
meal
?
<EOS>
Why
it
’s
real
—
no
,
I
mean
mock
—
<EOS>
mock
pearls—”“And
valueless
?
”
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“No
—
<EOS>
no
—
not
quite
—
not
quite
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
Here
is
a
new
guinea
—
<EOS>
a
bright
newguinea!”Ada
took
the
coin
,
and
said
,
languidly—“Alas
!
<EOS>
I
am
so
strange
here
<EOS>
,
I
know
not
even
how
to
dispose
of
this
toprocure
me
food
.
”“Indeed
?
”
said
the
jeweller
.
<EOS>
“
Do
you
know
nobody
?
<EOS>
Have
you
<EOS>
no
friends?”“Do
you
—
can
you
,
”
said
Ada
,
and
a
radiant
blush
suffused
her
cheeks
asshe
<EOS>
spoke—“can
you
tell
me
,
if
you
know
where
a
Sir
Seyton
lives?”“Does
<EOS>
he
know
you
had
a
necklace
?
”
said
the
Jew
.
<EOS>
“No
,
I
scarcely
knew
it
myself
.
”“Indeed
!
”
<EOS>
cried
the
jeweller
,
lifting
up
his
eyes
and
hands
.
<EOS>
“
My
dear
,
I
do
n’t
know
the
gentleman
you
mention
.
<EOS>
”“I
thank
you
,
”
said
Ada
,
rising
.
<EOS>
She
left
the
shop
,
and
looking
back
after
she
had
gone
a
few
paces
,
shecould
not
derive
how
it
was
that
the
Jew
was
putting
up
his
shutterswith
nervous
haste
.
<EOS>
She
little
knew
that
her
necklace
was
of
Indianpearls
,
and
worth
a
very
large
sum
indeed
.
<EOS>
To
her
joy
,
after
she
had
proceeded
a
few
paces
further
,
she
saw
thatthe
second
house
,
down
a
small
turning
to
her
left
,
was
a
littledairy
—
and
immediately
entering
,
she
requested
of
the
old
woman
whoserved
,
a
draft
of
milk
.
<EOS>
It
was
handed
to
her
,
and
she
drank
it
off
with
great
pleasure
and
laidon
the
little
counter
her
guinea
.
<EOS>
“Would
you
like
the
rest
,
miss
?
<EOS>
”
said
the
old
woman
;
“
you
do
seemtired
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
”“I
am
tired
,
”
said
Ada
,
“
and
would
gladly
rest
myself
,
if
I
am
not
inyour
way
.
<EOS>
”“Dear
<EOS>
heart
,
no
,
”
said
the
old
woman
.
<EOS>
“
Come
in
here
,
it
’s
<EOS>
warmer
thanthe
shop
.
<EOS>
What
weather
we
do
have
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
”Ada
<EOS>
accompanied
,
the
woman
to
the
little
parlour
at
the
back
of
theshop
,
and
the
good
dame
placed
before
her
some
rolls
and
more
milk
,
ofwhich
the
wearied
girl
partook
with
more
pleasure
than
she
ever
madebreakfast
with
before
.
<EOS>
“You
are
too
young
to
be
out
by
yourself
,
”
said
the
dame
;
“
and
a
greatdeal
too
pretty
too
.
<EOS>
”Ada
<EOS>
shook
her
head
,
as
she
<EOS>
said,—“Do
<EOS>
you
know
where
resides
a
Mr.
Seyton?”“No
,
”
replied
the
woman
.
<EOS>
“
This
London
is
such
an
immense
place
,
thatit
’s
like
looking
for
a
needle
in
a
bottle
of
hay
to
find
anybody
.
<EOS>
”“If
<EOS>
I
could
find
him
,
”
sighed
Ada
,
“
he
would
be
my
friend
.
<EOS>
Is
there
agentleman
named
Sir
Francis
Hartleton?”“Indeed
there
is
;
and
if
you
want
him
,
he
lives
close
at
hand
.
<EOS>
He
is
amagistrate
,
and
as
good
a
man
as
ever
breathed
.
”“Indeed
,
”
said
Ada
,
“
’
<EOS>
Tis
<EOS>
very
strange!”“What
’s
strange
,
my
dear?”“Oh
,
nothing
—
nothing
.
<EOS>
Can
you
show
me
to
his
house?”“Yes
;
if
you
come
to
the
door
,
I
can
point
it
out
for
you
,
though
hevery
likely
to
be
at
his
office
,
and
that
’s
across
the
park
.
<EOS>
”Ada
<EOS>
accompanied
the
old
woman
to
her
outer
door
,
and
she
pointed
out
tothe
refreshed
and
much
revived
girl
a
handsome
house
,
as
the
residenceof
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
.
<EOS>
She
again
tendered
her
guinea
,
but
the
kind
-
hearted
woman
replied—“Pho
,
pho
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
You
sha’n’t
change
your
guinea
for
a
sup
of
milk
.
<EOS>
”The
tears
gathered
to
Ada
’s
eyes
at
this
trifling
act
of
kindness
,
andshe
grasped
the
hand
of
the
good
dame
,
warmly
,
as
she
said
,
in
a
voiceof
emotion,—“I
am
not
used
to
kindness
.
<EOS>
”“Not
used
to
kindness
?
<EOS>
Ah
,
well
,
poor
thing
!
<EOS>
If
your

come
here
again
.
<EOS>
”“If
<EOS>
I
live
,
”
said
Ada
,
“
I
will
visit
you
again
.
<EOS>
”She
<EOS>
then
,
with
a
sweet
smile
,
walked
from
the
little
dairy
,
and
slowlyapproached
the
house
of
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
.
<EOS>
She
paused
as
she
nearedit
,
and
many
anxious
doubts
and
fears
crossed
her
mind
,
concerning
theresult
of
an
interview
with
the
magistrate
;
to
whom
Jacob
Gray’smysterious
bundle
of
papers
was
addressed
,
and
above
all
,
rose
like
aspectre
,
the
still
clinging
horrible
supposition
that
Jacob
Gray
mightpossibly
be
her
father
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
positively
swear
that
he
was
not
.
<EOS>
In
defiance
of
all
probability
he
might
have
spoken
the
truth
.
<EOS>
She
stood
by
the
portico
of
the
magistrate
’s
house
,
and
herirresolution
increased
each
moment
that
she
strove
to
reason
with
herfears
.
<EOS>
“Dare
<EOS>
I
,
”
she
thought
,
“
run
this
dreadful
risk
?
<EOS>
Heaven
knows
what
thatpaper
may
contain
which
Gray
sets
such
store
by
.
<EOS>
Some
awful
history
ofcrime
and
suffering
,
perchance
,
which
would
bring
him
to
a
scaffold
andproclaim
me
the
child
of
a
murderer
.
<EOS>
Can
I
make
conditions
with
themagistrates
?
<EOS>
Can
I
say
to
him
,
I
will
direct
you
to
a
packet
addressedto
yourself
,
containing
,
I
know
not
<EOS>
what
,
which
you
can
send
a
force
,
if
necessary
,
to
possess
yourself
of
,
but
<EOS>
which
you
must
act
upon
onlyso
far
as
may
be
consistent
with
my
feelings
?
<EOS>
Alas
,
no
!
<EOS>
I
feel
thatsuch
would
not
be
acceded
to
,
and
I
am
tortured
by
doubts
andanxieties
—
dreadful
fears
—
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
,
what
devil
tempted
you
to
raise
sodreadful
a
supposition
in
my
mind
that
you
might
be
my
father
?
<EOS>
And
yetI
do
not
,
can
not
believe
you

<EOS>
No
—
<EOS>
but
I
doubt
—
<EOS>
ay

<EOS>
There
lies
theagony

<EOS>
The
fearful
irresolution
that
cramped
my
very
soul
—
cripples
myexertions
to
be
free
,
and
makes
me
the
unhappy
,
wretched
thing
I
am

<EOS>
No

I
can
not

betray
thee
to
death

Jacob

although
you
wouldhave
taken
my

<EOS>
”Scarcely
,
in
the
confusion
of
other
feelings
,
knowing
whither
she
went
,
she
passed
the
door
of
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
’s
house
,
nor
paused
tillshe
found
herself
in
the
Bird
Cage
Walk
,
in
St.
James
’s
Park
.
<EOS>
It
wasstill
very
early
,
but
the
fine
bracing
morning
had
attracted
manypedestrians
to
the
park
,
and
the
various
walks
were
beginning
to
assumea
gay
appearance
,
<EOS>
the
fashionable
hour
of
promenading
being
then
muchearlier
than
it
is
at

.
<EOS>
Many
an
admiring
glance
was
cast
upon
the
beautiful
Ada
as
she
slowlytook
her
uncertain
way
beneath
the
tall
ancient
trees
which
have
nowgiven
place
to
young
saplings
,
the
fall
beauty
of
which
the
presentgenerations
will
never
enjoy
.
<EOS>
The
cool
air
that
blew
across
the
wideexpanse
imparted
a
delicate
bloom
to
her
cheeks
,
that
many
a
courtbeauty
would
have
bartered
a
portion
of
her
existence
to
obtain
.
<EOS>
Thehat
she
wore

partially
confined
the
long
dancing
black
ringletsthat
fell
in
nature

<EOS>
own
freedom
on
her
neck
and
shoulders
;
and
,
withal
<EOS>
,
there
was
a
sweet
pensiveness
in
her
manner
,
and
theexpressions
of
her
face
,
which
greatly
charmed
and
interested
all
thegentlemen
,
and
greatly
vexed
and
discomposed
all
the
ladies
,
who
,
withone
accord
,
voted
it
to
be
affectation
.
<EOS>
How
little
they
dreamt
of
the
deep
sorrow
that
was
in
the
young
girl’sheart
.
<EOS>
She
walked
on
till
she
reached
the
Great
Mall
,
and
then
,
feelingsomewhat
weary
she
sat
down
on
one
of
the
wooden
seats
,
and
seeingnothing

hearing
nothing
,
she
gave
herself
up
to
her
own
thoughts
,
andtears
trickled
slowly
from
her
eyes
,
as
all
her
meditations
tended
tothe
one
conclusion
that
she
must
starve
or
go
back
to
the
lone
houseand
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
She
was
aroused
from
her
reverie
by
some
one
repeatedly
,
in
an
affecteddrawl
pronouncing
the
word,—“Delicious
:
de
—
licious
;
oh

de

licous
!
”
<EOS>
immediately
in
front
of
whereshe
sat
.
<EOS>
Ada
looked
up
,
and
balancing
himself
before
her
,
nearly
on
his
toes
,
was
an
affectedly
dressed
person
who
was
staring
at
her
through
anopera
-
glass
,
and
repeating
the
word
delicious
,
as
conveying
his
extremeadmiration
of
her
.
<EOS>
When
Ada
looked
up
he
advanced
with
a
smirk
and
abow
,
and
laying
his
hand
on
his
embroidered
waistcoat
,
said
,
in
thesame
drawling
,
affected
tone—“My

<EOS>
Eh

”
said
Ada
,
annoyed
by
the
tone
of
the
remarks
,
the
substance
ofwhich
she
scarcely
heard
or
comprehended

<EOS>
“Charming
simplicity

<EOS>
cried
the
beau
;
“

<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
seated
himself
with
these
words
by
the
side
of
Ada
,
and
attempted
,
by
an
affected
,
apeish
manner
,
to
take
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Ada
shrunk
from
his
touch
,
and
rising
with
an
innocent
dignity
,
thatappalled
for
a
moment
the
fine
gentleman
<EOS>
,
she
said—“I
do
not
know
you
,
sir

”
and
walked
onwards
,
leaving
him
thequestionable
credit
of
having
turned
her
out
of
the
seat
.
<EOS>
“Charming

<EOS>
charming

”
<EOS>
she
heard
him
say
,
after
a
few
moments
,
as
hepursued
her
along
the
Mall
.
<EOS>
Ada
was
excessively
annoyed
at
this
most
disagreeable
intrusion
,
andshe
quickened
her
pace
in
the
hope
of
distancing
the
gallant
;
such
,
however
,
was
not
the
event
,
for
he
was
nearly
close
to
her
when
shearrived
at
the
next
seat
,
which
was
occupied
but
by
one
gentleman
,
whowas
reading
a

<EOS>
“One
stranger

thought
Ada
,
“

protect

from

”
and
she
paused
close
to
the
seat
on
which

“’Pon

“Harry

My

My

at

then
having
by
dint

procured
some

his
due

the
Government

we
have
come
close
here
by

I
am
myself
in
the
hope

procuring
a
situation
as
privatesecretary

a
man

they
say
,
of
enormous
wealth

great
liberality

”Ada

“You

Albert

that
I

around

who

what
I

I

my

I

”“Your

”“My

“How
<EOS>
so?”“Last
night
there
came
with
furious
knocking
at
our
house

two
men

<EOS>
Myuncle
said
they
came
to
take
his
life

mine

that

not
findingme

they
would
allow
him
to
escape

<EOS>
”“’Tis
<EOS>
very
strange

<EOS>
”“He
urged
me
then
to
change
my
boyish
clothing
for
these
garments
.
<EOS>
Iresisted
his
request
;
he
implored
me
—
begged
of
me
to
do
so
,
saying
thatthose
who
sought
me
knew
me
<EOS>
but
as
a
boy
,
and
would
allow
a
girl
topass
out
unmolested
.
<EOS>
Still
I
refused
,
for
he
had
taken
the
life
of
apoor
dog
that
loved
me
,
and
my
mind
was
sore
against
him
.
<EOS>
He
kneeled
tome
,
wept
,
and
at
the
last
moment
declared
himself
my
father

amurderer!”“Good
<EOS>
Heavens!”“Yes

the
words
fell
like
a
thunderbolt
on
my
heart

The
men
were
atthe
door

there
was
not

With
frantic
speed
I
did
hisbidding

”“And
<EOS>
the
plan
succeeded?”“It
did

<EOS>
With
wondering
looks
they
let
me
pass
.
<EOS>
I
wandered
<EOS>
I
know
notwhere;—to
some
bridge
I
came
at
length
,
and
there
,
as
I
lay
crouchingfrom
the
cold
of
the
raw
morning
,
one
of
the
men
passed
over
.
<EOS>
”“One
of
those
who
sought
Jacob
Gray?”“Yes
,
the
most
violent
.
<EOS>
There
,
within
my
hearing
,
he
had
an
altercationwith
a
poor
mad
wanderer
,
from
whom
I
heard
his
name

<EOS>
”“His
name

Ada?—It
may
afford
some
clue

may

called
him
Andrew
Britton

”“Andrew
<EOS>
Britton!—I
will
not

<EOS>
”“He
attempted
her
murder

<EOS>
My
screams
,
I
believe
,
saved
her
life

<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
their
discourse
,
Ada?—What
said
they?”“Their
speech
was
of
some
child
to
whom
great
wrong
had
been
done
yearssince
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Albert
,
my
heart
told
me
it

spoke

”“Could
<EOS>
you
learn
nothing
of
the
woman?”“Alas
!
<EOS>
No

<EOS>
Her
wits
were
gone

<EOS>
She
wandered
strangely
in
her
speech;madness
had
taken
possession
of
her
,
and
she
,
who
seemed
to
know
themystery
which
envelopes
me

could
not
shape
her
thoughts

me

”“Heaven

work
out
your
deliverance

tangled
web

guilt

mystery

is
cast
around
you

<EOS>
I
stillthink
,
as
I
thought
before

that
the
packet
which
Gray
keeps
socarefully
concealed
would
unravel
all

<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
perhaps
destroy
him!”“It
might
be
so

”“Then
,
Albert

arises
the
terrible
doubt
that
bad

wicked

cruel
as
heis

may
be
the

wretched
Ada

I

Albert

that
is
the
best

the

merciful
course

My

will
undertake

make
such
termswith
Jacob

will
be
mild

firm

When
Gray
left
the
public

house
in
which
lay
the
body
of
the
murderedwaterman

he
took
a
rapid
route
by
the
edge
of
the
river
to
his
owngloomy
home
,
and
very
soon
reached
the
cluster
of
condemned
houses
,
inone
of
which
he
resided
.
<EOS>
Looking
very
cautiously
around
him
,
as
was
his
invariable
custom
beforegliding
into
his
abode
,
to
see
if
any
one
was
observing
him
,
he
took
akey
from
his
pocket
,
and
,
opening
the
frail
door
,
quickly
entered
thepassage
.
<EOS>
Then
applying
his
eye
to
the
window
,
through
which
he
had
reconnoitredBritton
and
Learmont
,
he
took
a
long
look
up
and
down
the
street
to
seeif
he
could
detect
the
form
of
Ada
lurking
in
any
of
the
doorways
,
awaiting
his
return
.
<EOS>
“She
is
not
here
,
”
he
muttered
.
<EOS>
“
Well
,
she
knows
nothing
—
can
guessnothing
,
or
,
what
little
she
does
know
or
guess
,
she
dares
not
utter
tohuman
ears
,
for
she
will
be
tormented
by
the
supposition
that
I
may
beher
father
.
<EOS>
Let
her
die
in
the
streets
—
let
her
rot
,
so
she
trouble
notme
;
<EOS>
and
yet
I
wonder
she
has
not
returned
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
lost
her
way
.
<EOS>
”Gray
<EOS>
then
opened
the
door
again
,
and
wiped
off
the
words
he
hadwritten
,
then
,
carefully
closing
it
,
he
had
ascended
about
half
way
upthe
creaking
staircase
,
when
his
ears
were
suddenly
saluted
by
a
noisethat
made
him
tremble
,
and
convulsively
clutch
the
crazy
banisters
forsupport
.
<EOS>
The
noise
was
of
quite
a
new
character
to
Jacob
Gray
,
and
he
could
notdivine
how
or
in
what
manner
it
could
possibly
be
produced
.
<EOS>
It
was
nota
walking
,
it
was
not
a
fighting
or
a
struggling
—
a
dancing
;
but
it
wasa
singular
and
wonderful
admixture
of
them
all
.
<EOS>
Then
there
would
be
ashuffling
scramble
across
the
floor
,
then
a
hop
,
step
,
and
a
jump
,
apparently
,
which
would
be
followed
by
a
continued
bumping
thatthreatened
the
existence
of
the
crazy
house
,
and
shook
it
to
the
veryfoundation
.
<EOS>
The
perspiration
of
intense
fear
broke
out
upon
the
aching
forehead
ofJacob
Gray
,
and
he
sat
down
melancholy
upon
the
stairs
,
to
try
to
thinkwhat
could
be
the
cause
of
the
singular
uproar
in
his
commonly
solonely
dwelling
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
the
noise
approached
the
stair
-
head
,
and
it
assumed
the
formof
the
pattering
of
naked
feet
,
accompanied
by
the
heavy
tread
of
someone
in
clumsy
shoes
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
’s
superstitious
fears
,
and
<EOS>
they
were
tolerably
numerous
,
gotthe
better
of
his
prudence
,
and
he
raised
a
cry
of
terror
at
the
ideaof
something
of
an
unearthly
character
having
taken
up
its
abode
in
hissolitary
dwelling
.
<EOS>
The
moment
he
spoke
,
the
sounds
rapidly
retreated
from
the
stair
-
head
,
and
for
a
few
moments
all
was
still
as
the
grave
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
listened
attentively
for
a
long
time
before
he
would
ventureup
the
staircase
,
and
when
he
did
so
,
it
was
step
by
step
,
and
with
theutmost
caution
.
<EOS>
When
he
reached
the
top
,
he
stood
for
a
time
,
and
listened
attentively
.
<EOS>
Not
a
sound
met
his
ears
.
<EOS>
Then
he
gathered
courage
,
and
advanced
to
thedoor
of
the
room
from
whence
the
noises
had
seemed
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
All
was
still
,
and
Jacob
Gray
summoned
his
courage
to
turn
the
handleof
the
lock
and
peer
into
the
apartment
.
<EOS>
“There
is
no
one
here
,
”
he
muttered
.
<EOS>
“
What
could
it
have
been?Imagination
<EOS>
could
not
so
deceive
me!”As
<EOS>
he
glanced
round
the
room
,
to
his
surprise
,
he
saw
that
several
ofthe
articles
which
it
contained
were
displaced
;
and
his
apprehensionswere
still
further
increased
by
seeing
on
the
floor
several
prints
offeet
,
of
a
character
he
could
not
define
,
and
was
quite
certain
<EOS>
he
hadnever
seen
before
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
had
he
time
to
think
upon
these
strange
and
startlingappearances
,
when
a
low
growl
met
his
ears
,
and
immediately
upon
that
avoice
exclaimed.—“There
,
now
,
you
’ve
done
it
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
cuss
you
,
Popsy
.
<EOS>
”Gray
gave
a
jump
to
the
door
,
and
he
could
scarcely
believe
his
eyeswhen
a
man
’s
head
appeared
from
beneath
the
sofa
,
and
confronted
himwith
a
mixed
expression
of
effrontery
and
apprehension
.
<EOS>
“How
—
came
—
you
—
here
?
”
<EOS>
gasped
Gray
.
<EOS>
“Popsy
come
out
,
”
was
the
man
’s
<EOS>
only
reply
to
his
interrogatory
;
and
,
to
Gray
’s
surprise
,
an
immense
shaggy
bear
made
its
appearance
from
thesame
place
of
concealment
.
<EOS>
“Who
are
you
?
”
<EOS>
cried
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
“Why
<EOS>
do
n’t
you
answer
the
gentleman
,
you
brute
?
”
<EOS>
said
the
man
,
dealingthe
bear
a
heavy
blow
with
his
fist
;
“

lost
uponyou
,
that
they
is—”“How
dare
you

here

”
<EOS>
cried
Gray
.
<EOS>
“Don’t
ye
hear
?
”
<EOS>
screamed
the
man
,
still
addressing
the
bear
.
<EOS>
“
How
dareye
come
here?—Eh?”“Spy!—Villain
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Gray
,
drawing
from
his
breast
<EOS>
the
same
knife
withwhich
<EOS>
he
would
have
stabbed
Ada
to
the
heart
.
<EOS>
“Hilloah!—Hilloah
!
”
cried
the
man
.
<EOS>
“
Do
you
hear
,
my
Popsy
,
what
hecalls
<EOS>
ye?”The
bear
commenced
a
low
growling
,
and
displayed
a
formidable
row
ofblackened
fangs
at
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
“Who
<EOS>
and
what
are
you
?
”
<EOS>
shrieked
Gray
to
the
man
.
<EOS>
“Barbican
Tibbs
,

but

people
calls
me

nothink

<EOS>
”“What

”
<EOS>
cried
Gray
.
<EOS>
“Oh

I
’m

replied
the
man
,
“

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
then
,
quickly

<EOS>
”“Why

you

as
I

only

I
makes

a

”“Faces

”“Well

”“And

made

noise

heard
just
now
,
as
I
was
ascendingthe

like

it
has
quite
alarmed
poor
Popsy

shattered
hisnerves
by
squeaking
out
in
the
passage

”“How
long

”“Popsy
<EOS>
,
does
ye
hear
what
a
opinion
he
has
of
your
morals?”Gray
walked
across
the
room
,
and
opening
a
door
that
led
to
an
innerapartment
,
he
entered
it
and
remained
absent
some
minutes
.
<EOS>
During
thatabsence
he
took
from
a
chest
(
the
key
of
which
he
had
about
him
)
alarge
sum
of
money
,
being
the
bulk
of
what
he
had
,
from
time
to
time
,
received
of
Learmont
,
and
he
stowed
it
carefully
about
his
person
;
thegreatest
care
,
however
,
he
bestowed
upon
a
packet
of
papers
that
wereat
the
bottom
of
the
bag
.
<EOS>
These
he
placed
carefully
in
his
breast
,
andthen
returned
to
the
room
in
which
was
the
bear
warden
and
his
shaggyassociate
.
<EOS>
“Hark
<EOS>

said
Gray
,
“
I
am
going

”“Good

said
the

“You

“

hurried
to
the
cupboard
,
and
took
from
it
the
remainder
of
thepoison
he
had
given
to
Ada
’s
dog

then
turning
to
the
astonished

he
said,—“Remember

”He
<EOS>
rapidly
then
descended
the
staircase

was
out

“Well

<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
was
not
acting
with
his
usual
caution
when
he
left
suchdirections
to
the
bear
warden
;
but
the
attempt
which
had
been
made
uponhis
life
by
Learmont
and
the
smith
had
filled
him
with
rage
,
and
hewould
,
in
the
height
of
his
passion
,
willingly
run
some
risk
to
berevenged
upon
them
.
<EOS>
“There
is
an
ancient
uninhabited
house
;
”
he
muttered
,
“
nigh
toBattersea

have
several

noted

<EOS>
Its

There

<EOS>
They

<EOS>
”As
<EOS>
he
spoke
,
he
cast
an
habitual
glance
of
caution
up
and
down
thestreet
,
ere
he
emerged
from
the
doorway
of
the
house
<EOS>
he
was
about
toleave
for
ever
.
<EOS>
Some
distance
from
him
,
the
flutter
of
a
white
garment
caught
his
eye
,
and
he
retreated
back
into
the
shadow
of
the
doorway
,
from
where
hepeered
forth
,
to
note
who
it
could
be
that
was
approaching
thatsolitary
and
ill
-
omened
district
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
he
clutched
the
door
-
post
for
support
,
and
a
deadly
palenesscame
over
him
.
<EOS>
He
saw
Ada
taking
leave
of
Albert
Seyton
at
the
cornerof
the
street
.
<EOS>
He
saw
her
hands
clasped
in
affectionate
pressure
.
<EOS>
Then
,
with
a
lingering
step
.
<EOS>
Albert
Seyton
turned
away
,
looking
,
however
,
many
times
back
again
to
smile
another
brief
farewell
to
Ada
.
<EOS>
The
deadly
feelings
of
hatred
that
Gray
entertained
towards
AlbertSeyton
now
all
returned
in
their
full
force
,
and
he
muttered
curses
,
deep
and
appalling
,
against
both
him
and
Ada
.
<EOS>
“That
boy
again
,
”
he
growled
between
his
clenched
teeth
.
<EOS>
“
How

Now

<EOS>
”Ada
<EOS>
now
rapidly
approached
the
doorway
,
in
the
shadow
of
which
Gray
wasconcealed
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
smile
of
joy
upon
her
face
—
the
pure
light
ofhappiness
danced
in
her
eyes
—
and
her
step
was
agile
as
a
young
fawn
.
<EOS>
“Another
hour
,
”
she
whispered
to
herself—“but
another

bestowed
upon

<EOS>
Gray
must
see
his
own
interests
and
safety
in
making
termswith
Albert
and
his
father
.
<EOS>
He
will
tell
all
—
he
will
absolve
me
fromthe
fancied
ties
of
friendship
,
and
I
will
forgive
him
for
all
he
hasmade
me
suffer
.
<EOS>
If
he
be
very
guilty
,
in
another

he
may
findsecurity
and
repentance
—
nay

make
his
peace
with
Heaven

<EOS>
”Such
were
the
glowing
thoughts
of
the
young
girl
,
who
was
hastening
toseparate
herself
from
those
who
loved
her
,
while
in
her
guileless
heartshe
fondly
imagined
she
was
taking

<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
saw
her
approaching

<EOS>
Eagerly
he
watched
her
steps
,
and
whenshe
paused
at
the
door
of
the
house
,
he
shrunk
back
into
the
passage
,
and
allowed
her
to
enter
its
gloomy
portal
.
<EOS>
Then
stepping
forward
;
heclosed
the
door
,
and
said
in
a
low
tone,—“Ada
,
is
there
anything
in
this
house
you
value?”Ada
started
,
and
glanced
at
Gray
with
surprise
,
as
she
replied,—“Why
<EOS>
do
you
ask
?
<EOS>
You
see
I
have
returned
.
<EOS>
”“Ay
.
<EOS>
You
could
not
desert
your
father
!
”
<EOS>
smiled
Gray
.
<EOS>
Ada
shrunk
back
as
he
laid
his
hand
upon
her
shoulder
,
and
he
could
notbut
note
the
shudder
of
dislike
that
came
over
her
.
<EOS>
“Listen
to
me
,
”
he
said
.
<EOS>
“
I
will
give
you
your
choice
of
one
or
twoalternatives
.
<EOS>
”“What
mean
you
.
<EOS>
”“You
recollect
the
young
man
,
Albert
Seyton?”A
deep
blush
came
over
Ada
’s
face
,
as
she
said,—“I
do
.
<EOS>
”“Well
<EOS>
—
he
had
a
father—”“He
has
a
father
still
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Ada
.
<EOS>
“In
—
deed
!
”
<EOS>
sneered
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
You
know
that
.
<EOS>
”Ada
<EOS>
looked
confused
.
<EOS>
“Nay
,
”
continued
Gray
,
“
you
need
not
blush
.
<EOS>
Think
you
,
<EOS>
Albert
Seytonloves
you?”“Loves
me
?
”
echoed
Ada
.
<EOS>
“Ay
.
<EOS>
You
have
read
enough
to
tell
you
the
meaning
of
the
term
.
<EOS>
”Ada
was
silent
.
<EOS>
“Attend
to
my
words
,
”
continued
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
I
have
another
home
besidesthis
.
”“Another
<EOS>
home?”“Yes
,
Ada
;
and
in
that
other
home
there
are
domestics
which
would
placeyou
in
so
proud
a
station
,
that
Albert
Seyton
would
,
in
calling
you
hissome
few
years
hence
,
be
acquiring
a
rank
and
fortune
beyond
his
oryour
wildest
dreams
.
<EOS>
”Ada
<EOS>
’s
<EOS>
eyes
sparkled
as
Gray
spoke
,
and
she
involuntarily
moved
a
steptowards
him
.
<EOS>
The
thought
of
enriching
,
perhaps
ennobling
,
the
poordependent
Albert
Seyton
,
was
delightful
to
her
heart
.
<EOS>
“Oh
!
”
she
cried
,
“
if
you
can
do
this
,
I
will
forget
all
the
past
.
”“At
<EOS>
my
house

”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
’
Tis
near
at

<EOS>
”“I
will
count
the
minutes
till

said
Ada

<EOS>
“
Oh

<EOS>
”“Yes

<EOS>
”“No
<EOS>
—
I
—
wish
not
to

here
,
”
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“Not
leave
here

<EOS>
Has
your
love
for
this
place
suddenly
grown
so
strong?”“I
am
weary

”
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“Then
<EOS>
we
part
for
ever
!
<EOS>
Farewell

<EOS>
Ada
.
<EOS>
I
go
now
to
destroy

to

<EOS>
Carry
with
you
through

the
doubts

harassyou!”“Why
force
me

accompany
you

”
<EOS>
said
Ada

<EOS>
“
I
am
very
weary

”“Decide

<EOS>
The
distance
is

short

<EOS>
The
next

”
<EOS>
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“
Will
it
consume
but
half
an
hour?”“Scarcely
so
much
.
<EOS>
A
boat
will
take
us
where
we
are
going
in
half
thetime

”“Jacob
<EOS>
Gray
,
”
said
Ada
,
solemnly
.
<EOS>
“Well
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
well
,
”
replied
Gray
,
avoiding
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
“On
<EOS>
your
soul
,
are
you
speaking
truly?”“On

<EOS>
my
soul!”“You
swear
you
are
not
deceiving

swear!”“We

assuredly

<EOS>
Then
my

Albert

<EOS>
”“I

said
Ada

<EOS>
“
Let

hasten
—
but
half

,
not
so
long
a
time

<EOS>
”Still
Ada
hesitated
.
<EOS>
“You
will
know
all
then
,
”
remarked
Gray
;
“
who
and
what
you
are
,
youwill
know
;
but
if
you
come
not
now
,
I
leave
you
this

for
ever!You’ll
never
see
me
more

<EOS>
And
in
losing
me
,
you
lose
all
clue
to
thesolution
of
mysteries
that
will
torture
you
through
life

<EOS>
”“I
will
go
—
I
will
go

”
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“
Within
the
hour
we
shall
return
.
<EOS>
”“We
<EOS>
shall
.
<EOS>
Come
,
Ada
,
come
.
<EOS>
”“The
papers
that
were
above
in
the
chest
,
where
are
they?”“In
my
safe
keeping
,
”
cried
Gray
.
<EOS>
“I
am
weary
.
<EOS>
Will
you
not
wait
until
sunset?”“Not
another
moment
.
<EOS>
”“Then
<EOS>
I
—
will
—
go
.
<EOS>
”Gray
took
her
by
the
arm
,
and
they
left
the
house
together
.
<EOS>
A
thousand
conflicting
thoughts
rushed
through
Ada
’s
mind
.
<EOS>
Theprominent
one
,
however
,
was
the
pleasure
it
would
give
her
to
meetAlbert
Seyton
,
no
longer
the
child
of
mystery
,
and
perhaps
of
guilt
,
but
the
proud
descendant
of
some
pure
and
unsullied
house
.
<EOS>
If
she
letGray
depart
now
,
with
him
all
chance
of
unravelling
doubts
andmysteries
which
,
as
he
truly
said
,
would
torture
her
through
life
,
would
be
lost
.
<EOS>
Albert
and
his
father
would
come
but
to
encumberthemselves
with
a
nameless
,
destitute
girl
.
<EOS>
That
she
could
not
bear
,
and
although
she
doubted
,
yet
,
she
trusted
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
Ada
,
when
she
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
accompany
Gray
,
quiteastonished
him
by
the
nervous
haste
which
she
showed
in
urging
himalong
,
and
his
naturally
suspicious
mind
at
once
surmised
that
therewas
some
especial
reason
in
the
mind
of
the
young
girl
which
inducedher
desire
to
return
to
the
house
they
were
leaving
within
the
hour
.
<EOS>
“She
has
betrayed
me
to
yon
boy
,
”
he
thought
.
<EOS>
“
’
Tis
more
than
likelythat
within
the
hour
I
should
be
a
prisoner
suing
for
mercy
to
him
,
andmy
confessions
in
his
hands
.
<EOS>
”They
soon
reached
the
river
side
,
and
Gray
,
addressing
a
waterman
said,—“Can
you
take
us
to
Battersea
,
quickly?”“Yes
,
master
,
”
said
the
man
;
“
the
tide
serves
.
<EOS>
”Without
<EOS>
another
word
Gray
handed
Ada
into
the
boat
,
and
they
were
soongliding
swiftly
along
the
Thames
,
towards
the
marshy
fields
ofBattersea
.
<EOS>
As
the
time
progressed
,
Ada
’s
uneasiness
became
more
and
more
apparent
,
and
when
the
waterman
tended
them
at
a
craggy
flight
of
wooden
stepsthat
merely
led
to
the
open
fields
,
a
tremor
came
over
her
,
and
shebegan
to
repent
trusting
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
“I
see
no
house
,
”
she
said
.
<EOS>
“
Whither
are
you
leading
me?”“There
—
to
your
left
,
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
Yon
low
building
is
the
place
of
ourdestination
.
<EOS>
”“Let
<EOS>
us
be
quick
,
”
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
With
a
sneering
smile
Jacob
Gray
led
the
way
by
the
side
of
the
scantyhedges
till
they
reached
the
gloomy
,
desolate
mansion
he
had
long
fixedupon
as
his
next
place
of
concealment
,
should
his
lone
dwelling
atLambeth
be
discovered
.
<EOS>
Ada
looked
upon
the
damp
crumbling
walls
and
shattered
windows
with
afeeling
of
dread
she
could
not
conceal
.
<EOS>
“
What
place
is
this
?
”
<EOS>
shefalteringly
asked
.
<EOS>
“’Tis
an
old
deserted
farm
-
house
,
”
said
Gray
,
“
in
which
a
murder
,
theysay
was
committed
.
<EOS>
”“A
murder?”“Yes
;
by
a
man
named
Forest
.
<EOS>
It
is
called
now
Forest
House
,
and
no
onewill
willingly
approach
it
.
<EOS>
”They
stood
now
in
the
shadow
of
the
deep
overhanging
porch
,
and
JacobGray
for
a
moment
gazed
around
him
upon
the
wide
expanse
of
marshyground
.
<EOS>
A
smile
of
triumph
lit
up
his
face
with
a
demoniac
-
expression
.
<EOS>
“Ada
,
”
he
said
,
“
you
would
have
betrayed
me
—
you
may
shriek
now
—
<EOS>
no
onewill
hear
you
;
you
may
struggle
—
no
one
will
aid
you
.
<EOS>
This
house
is
yourprison
—
perhaps
your
tomb
.
<EOS>
”Ada
<EOS>
clasped
her
hands
in
terror
and
despair
.
<EOS>
“
Betrayed
—
betrayed
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
Albert
—
”
she
cried
,
and
sunk
in
a
state
of
insensibility
on
the
doorstep
of
Forest
House

CHAPTER
XXXII.Albert
’s
Disappointment.—Tibbs
,
<EOS>
the
Bear
<EOS>
Warden.—The
Search.—AConsultation
.
<EOS>
Within
the
hour
he
had
named
as
being
the
extreme
limit
of
his
absence
,
Albert
Seyton
and
his
father
arrived
at
Gray
<EOS>
’s
house
at
Lambeth
.
<EOS>
Theyknocked
at
first
quietly
,
and
finally
loudly
,
for
admittance
.
<EOS>
Here
,
asthey
had
predetermined
,
they
burst
upon
the
frail
door
,
and
,
callingupon
Ada
,
<EOS>
Albert
flew
from
room
to
room
of
the
dismal
house
.
<EOS>
No
voice
responded
to
his
,
and
he
was
about
to
give
up
the
search
indespair
,
when
a
low
rumbling
sound
met
his
ears
from
a
room
he
hadalready
visited
,
and
which
was
immediately
followed
by
a
heavy
crash
ofsome
fallen
body
.
<EOS>
He
and
his
father
instantly
rushed
into
the
room
,
and
there
,
amid
theruins
,
a
table
,
several
bottles
,
glasses
,
&
c.
,
lay
Tibbs
,
the
bearwarden
,
who
was
evidently
far
gone
in
intoxication
.
<EOS>
The
bear
was
licking
its
paws
on
the
spot
which
would
have
been
underthe
table
had
that
article
of
furniture
preserved
its
perpendicularity;but
<EOS>
it
now
lay
on
one
side
,
and
it
is
to
be
surmised
that
Tipsy
Tibbshad
hidden
under
it
upon
hearing
the
sound
of
footsteps
,
and
then
upsetit
in
his
clumsy
efforts
to
emerge
from
his
temporary
concealment
.
<EOS>
Mr
.
<EOS>
Seyton
Albert
looked
with
undisguised
astonishment
on
the
strangespectacle
of
a
drunken
man
and
a
bear
,
where
they
expected
to
find
ayoung
girl
and
a
cool
designing
villain
.
<EOS>
“How
are
you
?
”
<EOS>
said
Tibbs
.
<EOS>
“
So
,
so
—
you’re
come
back
,
have
you?Hurrah
—
hurray
—
that
’s
my
op

opinion
.
<EOS>
”Albert
stepped
up
to
him
,
and
shaking
him
roughly
,
cried
in
a
loudvoice:—“Who
are
you?”“Who
—
who
—
am

<EOS>
Why

everybody
knows
me

here
?
<EOS>
Speak
at
once
.
<EOS>
”“A

w
—
<EOS>
what?”“A
young
girl
,
with
black
eyes
;
sparkling
as
diamonds
—
long
dancingringlets

”“Whew
!
”
<EOS>
whistled
Tibbs
.
<EOS>
“
Do
n’t
I
wish
I
had
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
the
little
charmer
.
”“Wretch
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Albert
,
“
have
you
seen
her?”“Do
<EOS>
—
do
—
you
mean
—
<EOS>
Mrs
.
<EOS>
Tibbs?”“Albert
,
”
said
Mr.
Seyton
,
“
we
shall
get
no
information
from
this
manby
angry
questioning
.
<EOS>
Allow
me
to
speak
to
him

<EOS>
Are
you
alone
here

myfriend?”“No

I
ain’t

”“Who

have
another

”“How

long
have
you
been
here?”“Two

I
say
,
have
you

two
—
two

”“The
villain
Gray
has
been
more
than
a
match
for
me
,
father
;
”
saidAlbert
.
<EOS>
“
My
poor
Ada
is
not
here!”He
sunk
upon
a
chair
,
and
gave
way
to
a
violent
burst
of
grief
as
hespoke
,
and
Tibbs
gazed
upon
him
in
speechless
astonishment
.
<EOS>
“Albert
,
”
said
his
father
,
“
this
is
childish
of
you
.
<EOS>
Let
us
thoroughlysearch
this
house

<EOS>
We
may
still
find
some
clue
to
the
object

oursearch

”“True
,
”
said
Albert
,
rising
,
“
I
will
not
despair
.
<EOS>
We
may
,
perchance
,
light
upon
the
mysterious
packet
of
papers
which
Jacob
Gray
thinks
somuch
of
,
and
which
were
addressed
to
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
.
<EOS>
”“Take
<EOS>
another
bottle
,
”
suggested
Tibbs
,
making
various
ridiculousefforts
to
get
on
his
feet
,
in
all
of
which
he
signally
failed
.
<EOS>
“Sot

”
said
Albert
,
“
I
will
force
more
intelligent
answers
from
you

”“Take

it
otherwise
.
<EOS>
”With
<EOS>
a
saddened
and
dejected
air
Albert
again
searched
the
house
.
<EOS>
Hefound
no
vestige
of
Ada
,
save
her
male
attire
and
the
dead
dog
.
<EOS>
An
openbook
was
upon
the
table
of
her
room
.
<EOS>
That
he
placed
next
his
heart
,
with
the
fond
thought
that
she
might
have
owned
and
prized
it
.
<EOS>
“Let
<EOS>
us
leave
this
place
,
”
said
his
father
,
“
and
the
more
quickly
thebetter
,
I
will
employ
someone
to
watch
the
house
for
some
days
in

should
return
,
and
in
the
meantime
,
we
will
ourselves
make
everyinquiry
,
and
use
our
utmost
endeavours
to
discover
his
retreat
.
<EOS>
”With
<EOS>
a
heavy
heart
<EOS>
Albert
left
the
house
;
he
lingered
long
at
the
doorand
in
the
street
,
and
it
was
only
his
father
’s
arguments
that
inducedhim
at
length
to
quit
the
spot
.
<EOS>
“Father
,
”
said
Albert
,
“
I
will
make
an
application
to
Sir
FrancisHartleton!”“You
forget
,
”
replied
Mr.
Seyton
,
“
that
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
is
amagistrate
and
has
a
public
duty
to
perform
,
from
which
he
is
not
theman
to
flinch
.
<EOS>
We
wish
to
temporise
with
this
man
Gray
,
and
not
drivehim
to
extremities
.
<EOS>
The
more
heartily
Sir
Francis
might
enter
into
thisbusiness
,
the
more
misery
we
might
be
laying
up
for
the
persecuted
girlit
is
our
wish
to
rescue
.
<EOS>
Recollect
,
Albert
,
there
still
lives
theawful
doubt
that
Jacob
Gray
may
still
be
the
father
of
Ada
.
<EOS>
”“It
is
an
awful
doubt
,
”
said
Albert
.
<EOS>
“We
<EOS>
must
not
then
embitter
her
existence
,
wicked
as
Gray
may
be
,
byexecuting
upon
him
the
full
measure
of
justice
until
that
doubt
issolved
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
coldly
right
to
do
so
,
I
will
grant
;
but
we
lookmore
to
Ada
’s
happiness
,
Albert
,
than
the
vengeance
of
the
law
upon
aguilty
man

<EOS>
”Albert
grasped
his
father
’s
hand
as
he
replied
,
in
a
voice
strugglingwith
emotion,—“Guide
me
,
father
—
tell
me
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
Your
words
bring
truth
andconviction
with

”“Then
,
Albert
,
if
you
succeed
in
getting
the
situation
you
have
beenendeavouring
to
obtain

as
private
secretary

so
rich

liberal

there
may
arise
some
opportunity

him
in

,
through

much
might
be
done
to
unravel
the
whole
mystery

turn
out

<EOS>
”“Yes

cried
Albert
,
with
renovated
hope
;
“

tell
me

rolling
in
wealth

<EOS>
”“Ay
<EOS>

that

unknown

”“It

said
Albert
.
<EOS>
Learmont
had
been
inquiring
of
several
persons
since
his
arrival
inLondon
for
some
young
man
as
private
secretary
,
and
Albert
Seyton
,
whonever
in
his
wildest
dreams
imagined
that
the
rich
Squire
Learmont
,
whose
wealth
was
the
theme
of
every
tongue
,
could
possibly
be
in
anyway
connected
with
the
fortunes
of
the
poor
persecuted

,
had
appliedfor

situation

met
with

evasive

CHAPTER
XXXIII.Learmont
at
Home.—Dark
Reflections.—The
Summons.—TheConfederates.—Suspicions
.
<EOS>
In
the
small
room
which
he
had
fitted
up
specially
for
himself
,
sat
theSquire
Learmont
,
in
an
attitude
of
deep
thought
.
<EOS>
His
lips
occasionallymoved
as
if
he
were
repeating
to
himself
the
subject
of
hismeditations
.
<EOS>
The
colour
went
and
came
upon
his
agitated
face
,
accordingto
the
uneven
tenor
of
his
thoughts
.
<EOS>
For
more
than
an
hour
he
thus
sat
,
and
then
suddenly
rising
as
if
with
a
violent
determination
to
shakeoff
completely
<EOS>
“
the
thick
coming
fancies
”
that
disturbed
his
brain
,
hewent
to
the
window
and
looked
out
upon
the
court
yard
of
his
mansion
.
<EOS>
The
uneasy
thoughts
of
Learmont
were
not
,
however
,
to
be
thus
laidaside
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
moments
he
again
threw
himself
into
the
chair
fromwhich
he
had
risen
,
and
commenced
in
a
low
,
anxious
,
trembling
tone
,
muttering
half
aloud
,
the
subject
of
his
gloomy
thoughts:—“Was
ever
a
man
,
”
he
said
,
“
so
circumstanced
as
I
?
<EOS>
With
all
the
will
toact
,
yet
so
hemmed
in
by
strange
circumstances
as
to
bepowerless
—
completely
powerless
.
<EOS>
In
truth
,
the
wily
Jacob
Gray
has
had
atriumph
.
<EOS>
Can
the
smith
have
played
me
false
,
and
warned
him
of
hisdanger
;
yet
,
no
<EOS>
—
I
can
not
think
so
.
<EOS>
Britton
hates
him
,
and
would
gladlytake
his
life
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
,
with
such
consummate
art
,
act
the
passionhe
exhibited
at
that
lonely
hovel
<EOS>
,
wherein
I
thought
I
had
entrappedthis
Gray
.
<EOS>
There
is
yet
another
supposition
.
<EOS>
Does
the
boy
live
?
<EOS>
Ay
,
isthere
a
young
heir
to
Learmont
’s
broad
acres
and
<EOS>
princely
revenues?That
is
a
grave
doubt
;
but
let
me
doubt
ever
<EOS>
so
strangely
,
I
dare
notact
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
—
Jacob
Gray
,
the
arch
-
fiend
himself
could
not
have
wovena
better
web
of
protection
around
a
human
life
than
you
have
castaround
yours
!
<EOS>
I
dare
not
kill
you
.
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
,
you
are
very
safe
.
<EOS>
”Learmont
<EOS>
clenched
his
hands
and
ground
his
teeth
together
,
in
impotentrage
,
as
he
felt
the
full
conviction
upon
his
mind
that
he
dared
not
,
for
his
own
life
’s
sake
,
interfere
with
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
“There
is
no
plan
but
one
,
”
he
said
,
after
a
long
pause
.
<EOS>
“
I
must
try
topurchase
from
him
,
by
some
large
and
tempting
offer
,
<EOS>
both
the
boy
andthe
confession
—
then
,
should
he
be
attracted
by
such
a
bait
<EOS>
,
he
shalldie
for
the
disquiet
he
has
given
me
.
<EOS>
If
I
slaughter
him
here
in
my
ownhouse
,
he
shall
die
.
<EOS>
I
shall
know
no
peace
till
that
man
is
a
corpse
.
<EOS>
”A
<EOS>
small
timepiece
in
the
room
now
struck
the
hour
of
twelve
.
<EOS>
“Twelve
o’clock
,
”
muttered
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“
’
Tis
the
hour
the
smith
said
hewould
be
here
;
but
punctuality
is
not
one
of
his
virtues
.
<EOS>
He
knows
Imust
wait
for
him
?
<EOS>
Curses
on
him
—
curses!”A
servant
slowly
opened
the
door
at
this
moment
,
and
said
,
in
a
timidvoice
,
for
the
household
had
had
several
specimens
of
Learmont
’s
wildpassions
and
violence,—“An
<EOS>
it
please
your
worship
,
here
is
Master
Gray
.
<EOS>
”“Show
<EOS>
him
here
,
”
said
Learmont
,
quickly
,
and
<EOS>
the
man
was
out
of
theroom
as
expeditiously
as
if
he
had
been
pulled
from
behind
with
asudden
jerk
.
<EOS>
“They
will
meet
here
,
”
muttered
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“
Well
,
be
it
so
.
<EOS>
Threepersons
so
strangely
knit
together
,
as
these
two
men
and
myself
,
weresurely
never
heard
of
.
<EOS>
Hating
them
with
that
hatred
which
requires
tobe
glutted
with
blood
to
calm
its
fury
;
yet
I
am
obliged
to
supplytheir
wildest
extravagancies
and
most
insolent
demands
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
if
I
,
dared
,
if
—
oh
,
you
are
here
,
Jacob
Gray?”“As
<EOS>
you
perceive
,
most
worshipful
sir
,
”
said
Gray
,
as
he
closed
thedoor
behind
him
,
and
fixed
his
keen
,
ferret
-
looking
eyes
upon
theSquire
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
minutes
they
regarded
each
other
in
silence
.
<EOS>
Learmont
atlength
,
uttered
the
word,—“Well?”“I
am
rejoiced
to
hear
you
are
well
,
”
sneered
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
The
fog
last
nightwas
very
damp
.
”“Jacob
<EOS>
Gray
,
”
said
Learmont
,
“
I
sought
your
life
.
<EOS>
”“Your
<EOS>
worship
was
so
kind
,
”
said
Gray
,
“
and
since
my
connexion
withyour
worship
has
grown
so
dangerous
,
it
shall
bear
a
higher
price
.
<EOS>
”“What
<EOS>
mean
you?”“I
mean

”
said
Gray
,
striking
the
palm
of
his
hand
with
his
fist—“Imean

If

<EOS>
You

Learmont
,
I

<EOS>
”There
was
a
strange
mixture
of
cunning
,
rage
,
and
ferocity
in
JacobGray
’s
tone
and
manner
as
he
made
this
speech
.
<EOS>
Every
other
word
that
hespoke
showed
a
disposition
to
shout
with
anger
,
but
then
it
was
asquickly
subdued
again
by
his
habitual
caution
and
timidity
.
<EOS>
When
he
hadfinished
he
glared
at
Learmont
with
a
pale
and
distorted
countenanceawaiting
his
reply
.
<EOS>
“Jacob
Gray
,
”
said
Learmont
,
“
I
did
seek
your
life
,
but
it
was
not
foryour

<EOS>

<EOS>
I
sought

.
”“Indeed

<EOS>
sneered
Gray
.
<EOS>
“No

continued
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“
What
is
your

?
<EOS>
But
the
precautionsthat
you
have
taken
to
protect

keep
me
in
continual
andimminent
danger

<EOS>
What
’s
so
uncertain
as
human
life?”“Ay

what

“
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“Suppose
<EOS>
your
sudden
death

by
accident

illness

what
<EOS>

I

said
Learmont

<EOS>
“
You
talk

“And

Learmont

“Yes

”“’Tis

said
Gray

confession?”“You
wrong
me

your
suspicions

said
Learmont
,
with
difficultysuppressing
the
rage
that
was
swelling
in
his
bosom

<EOS>
“A

hundred

said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“Jacob
Gray
,
hear
me—”“Hear
me
first
.
<EOS>
A
hundred
pounds!”Learmont
went
to
a
cabinet
in
the
apartment
,
and
without
another
wordcounted
out
the
sum
.
<EOS>
“Have
<EOS>
you
moved
Jacob
Gray
?
”
<EOS>
he
said
,
in
a
calm
voice
.
<EOS>
“Nay
,
”
replied
Gray
,
“
why
need
you
ask?”“A
message
from
the
Old
Smithy
,
”
announced
a
servant
at
this
juncture
.
<EOS>
“’Tis
<EOS>
Britton

”
whispered
Learmont
to
Gray

<EOS>
“What

cunning
Master
Britton

answered
Gray

<EOS>
“
Ho

<EOS>
Ho

<EOS>
I
shall
be
gladto

him

”“Admit
<EOS>
him

”
said
Learmont
to
the
servant
;
then
turning
to
Gray
,
headded,—“Will
<EOS>
you
leave
me
,
now?”“No
,
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“Wherefore?”“Because
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
the
smith
again
upon
my
track
,
like
a
bloodhound!”“Oh
,
Jacob
Gray
,
”
said
Learmont
,
“
if
you
could
destroy
Britton

securing
at
the

the
dangerous
papers
he
has

bring
me

your

Gray

<EOS>
“
<EOS>
If

<EOS>
”“You

<EOS>
”“Well

that

roared
Britton
,
as
the

held
the
door
openfor
him
to
enter
the
room

<EOS>
“
Oh

said
Gray

“
I

<EOS>
”“Curse

said
Britton

flinging
himself
into
a

<EOS>
“Bless

said
Gray

<EOS>
“
Ho

<EOS>
Clever
Britton

”“Perhaps

sneered
Learmont
,
“

”“Damnation

cried
Learmont

“
What

Gray

“
It

I
pray
you

take

<EOS>
”Britton
<EOS>
cast
a
savage
scowl
upon
Gray
,
as
he
said,—“I

mind

<EOS>
“

<EOS>
May

nowbe
indulged
with
the
privacy

said
Gray
,
“

why
do

<EOS>

cried
Britton

fiercely
.
<EOS>
“Well

said
Gray
,
rising
,
“

saying
,
Jacob

left
the

with
an
expression

demoniac

<EOS>
Britton
made
a
movement
to
follow
him

but
the
squire
laid
his

his

,
and
said,—“No

”“Curses

Britton

“

Melancholy
Home.—The
Prison
House.—A
Dungeon’sGloom.—Unavailing
<EOS>
Sorrow
.
<EOS>
When
Jacob
Gray
pitched
upon
the
lone
house
at
Battersea
as
his
placeof
abode
,
he
could
not
have
resolved
upon
a
house
less
likely
to
bevisited
by
the
curious
,
although
seen
from
the
river
at
a
considerabledistance
:
it
was
always
pointed
out
by
the
watermen
to
their
customers
,
as
“
Forest
’s
haunted
house
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
fact
was
,
that
a
most
awful
and
cold
-
blooded
murder
had
beencommitted
in
the
house
,
since
which
it
had
been
allowed
to
fall
intodecay
,
and
the
land
around
it
,
which
had
been
at
one
time
well
drained
,
had
subsided
into
its
old
character
of
a
marsh
.
<EOS>
The
fall
of
a
stack
ofchimnies
had
impressed
every
one
with
a
belief
of
the
extreme
danger
ofventuring
within
its
crazy
walls
,
lest
they
should
fall
and
engulf
therash
intruder
in
their
ruins
.
<EOS>
It
was
with
great
caution
that
Gray
first
visited
this
place
,
that
hewas
long
in
discovering
that
the
signs
of
decay
were
more
superficialthan
otherwise
,
and
,
inquiring
diligently
and
cautiously
concerning
it
,
he
heard
the
character
of
the
deserted
house
,
which
induced
himmentally
to
resolve
upon
making
it
his
next
abode
,
should
he
be
huntedout
of
his
miserable
residence
in
the
ruined
street
at
Lambeth
.
<EOS>
The
only
risk
he
considered
he
ran
of
discovery
was
in
conveying
Adathere
by
daylight
;
but
,
after
that
,
he
resolved
upon
never
leaving
orapproaching
his
gloomy
abode
except
by
night
,
or
early
in
the
morning
,
when
he
was
quite
sure
no
one
was
observing
him
,
save
upon
specialoccasions
,
such
as
his
recent
visit
to
Learmont
,
whom
he
was
anxious
tosee
after
the
stormy
meeting
in
his
former
residence
.
<EOS>
When
Ada
recovered
consciousness
,
she
at
first
felt
all
that
sensationof
relief
which
comes
over
any
one
awakening
from
a
horrible
dream
;
butthis
feeling
of
satisfaction
lingered
but
for
a
few
fleeting
moments
inthe
breast
of
the
persecuted
,
betrayed
girl
.
<EOS>
The
gloom
that
surroundedher
—
the
damp
air
that
imparted
a
chill
to
her
very
heart
—
the
dim
ray
oflight
that
proceeded
from
a
candle
,
the
wick
of
which
showed
that
ithad
been
some
hours
unattended
,
all
convinced
her
that
she
was
aprisoner
.
<EOS>
With
a
cry
of
despair
she
started
to
her
feet
:
<EOS>
she
clasped
her
hands
,
and
called
on
Heaven
to
protect
her
,
as
she
hastily
glanced
round
thegloomy
place
in
which
she
found
herself
.
<EOS>
The
dismal
echo
of
her
own
voice
only
answered
her
wild
and
incoherentappeal
.
<EOS>
“Oh
!
<EOS>
Heaven
,
”
she
cried
,
“
I
shall
be
murdered
here
.
<EOS>
No
one
to
hear
mycries
!
<EOS>
No
one
to
aid
me
!
<EOS>
I
am
lost
—
lost
!
<EOS>
Oh!—Albert
,
Albert!”She
sank
upon
the
ground
,
and
wept
long
and
bitterly
as
the
thoughts
ofhow
foolishly
she
had
allowed
herself
to
be
deceived
by
Gray
crowdedupon
her
oppressed
mind
.
<EOS>
“No
<EOS>
hope!—No
<EOS>
hope!—Now
there
is
no
hope
!
”
<EOS>
she
cried
,
bitterly
.
<EOS>
“
Oh
!
<EOS>
Whywas
<EOS>
I
preserved
for
this
dreadful
fate
!
<EOS>
I
thought
it
hard
to
endure
thecold
air
from
the
river
,
while
crouching
on
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
O
God
!
<EOS>
O
God!What
would
I
not
give
now
to
be
as
free
beneath
the
canopy
of
Heaven
asI
<EOS>
was
then!”After
a
time
the
native
energy
of
Ada
’s
character
overcame
her
firstbursts
of
bitter
grief
;
and
raising
her
head
she
strove
to
pierce
,
withher
tear
-
filled
eyes
,
the
dim
obscurity
by
which
she
was
surrounded
.
<EOS>
“What
can
this
place
be
?
”
<EOS>
she
asked
herself
.
<EOS>
“
Let
me
recollect
.
<EOS>
Hebrought
me
across
swampy
fields
to
a
ruined
house
,
and
there
,
at
thatpoint
,
recollection
ceases
—
memory
fades
away
in
a
confused
whirl
,
noneof
which
are
sufficiently
distinct
for
the
mind
to
grasp
and
reasonupon
.
<EOS>
”She
<EOS>
now
approached
the
light
,
and
,
carefully
trimming
it
,
she
held
itas
high
as
she
could
,
and
,
turning
slowly
round
,
took
a
long
andanxious
survey
of
as
much
as
she
could
see
of
her
dungeon
,
for
such
sheconsidered
it
.
<EOS>
The
floor
was
of
earth
merely
,
and
the
walls
seemed
to
be
composed
ofthe
same
material
,
mingled
with
stones
and
broken
bricks
,
to
give
themsome
degree
of
solidity
and
strength
.
<EOS>
The
place
altogether
appeared
tobe
of
considerable
extent
,
and
,
by
the
various
refuse
matter
that
layabout
,
it
would
seem
to
have
been
a
cellar
for
strong
vegetables
,
wood,&c
.
<EOS>
during
the
winter
season
.
<EOS>
A
quantity
of
rough
sacks
and
baskets
layin
different
corners
mouldy
and
moist
,
with
the
accumulated
damp
ofmany
years
,
and
the
air
,
too
,
was
loaded
with
unwholesome
moisture
,
andpernicious
exhalations
.
<EOS>
With
a
slow
and
cautious
step
Ada
traversed
the
whole
of
this
gloomyplace
,
and
what
surprised
her
much
was
that
she
could
see
no
means
ofingress
or
egress
from
it
.
<EOS>
“How
<EOS>
have
I
been
placed
here
?
”
<EOS>
she
asked
herself
.
<EOS>
“
There
is
no
food
.
<EOS>
Good
Heaven
!
<EOS>
Am
I
doomed
to
starve
in
this
wretched
place
?
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
Isthis
the
awful
mode
which
the
fears
of
Jacob
Gray
have
suggested
to
himas
the
easiest
and
safest
of
compassing
my
death?”So
terrible
did
the
dread
of
death
in
that
damp
,
gloomy
dungeon
becometo
the
imagination
of
Ada
that
she
could
scarcely
hold
the
light
fortrembling
,
and
she
placed
it
on
one
of
the
mouldy
baskets
,
while
withclasped
hands
,
and
upon
her
knees
,
she
breathed
a
prayer
to
Heaven
forprotection
and
safety
in
her
extreme
peril
.
<EOS>
How
calming
and
sweet
is
the
soothing
influence
of
prayer
!
<EOS>
As
thetrembling
words
,
wrung
from
the
pure
heart
of
the
gentle
and
beautifulAda
in
her
deep
anguish
,
ascended
to
that
Heaven
which
never
permitsthe
wicked
to
prosper
,
but
always
interposes
to
protect
the
innocentand
virtuous
,
a
holy
balm
seemed
to
fall
upon
her
blighted
spirit
,
andthe
benign
influence
of
some
air
from
the
regions
of
eternal
blissseemed
to
fill
the
gloomy
dungeon
with
a
brightness
and
a
beauty
thatdeprived
it
of
its
horrors
.
<EOS>
For
many
minutes
now
Ada
remained
silent
,
and
her
fancy
strayed
to
thelast
kind
words
of
Albert
Seyton
.
<EOS>
Then
she
pictured
him
and
his
fatherseeking
her
in
the
house
at
Lambeth
.
<EOS>
In
her
mind
’s
eye
she
saw
hisdespair
when
he
found
her
not
,
and
she
thought
then
that
her
heart
mustbreak
to
think
that
she
should
never
see
him
more
.
<EOS>
“Albert
—
Albert

”
<EOS>
she
cried.—“Oh
save
me
—
save
—
seek
for
me

<EOS>
Oh

themselves
upon

far
happier

feelconvinced
this
dreadful
man
Gray
is
not
my
father

<EOS>
No
—
<EOS>
no
,
he
could
notthus
before
Heaven
have
betrayed
his
child
!
<EOS>
Albert
—
Albert!”She
dropped
her
head
upon
her
breast
,
and
again
the
tears
blinded
thosebeautiful
eyes
,
and
rolled
gently
down
her
cheeks
,
thence
falling
upona
neck
of
snowy
whiteness
,
and
losing
their
gem
-
like
lustre
in
themeshes
of
her
raven
hair
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
she
ceased
to
weep
.
<EOS>
She
ceased
tocall
on
Albert
,
and
a
chill
came
over
her
heart
,
as
she
heard
Gray’svoice
,
cry,—“Ada
—
Ada!”She
looked
up
,
and
from
a
square
opening
in
the
wall
far
above
herreach
,
she
saw
a
streaming
light
enter
the
dungeon
.
<EOS>
“Ada
!
”
<EOS>
again
cried
Gray
,
and
she
saw
him
peering
into
the
gloom
below
,
and
shading
his
eyes
from
the
glare
of
the
light
he
carried
.
<EOS>
“
Ada
!
”
<EOS>
hecried
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
“I
am
here
,
”
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
Gray
immediately
disappeared
from
the
opening
,
and
all
was
<EOS>
againdarkness
whence
the
light
had
issued
.
<EOS>
“What
<EOS>
can
he
mean
?
”
<EOS>
thought
Ada
.
<EOS>
“
Did
he
suppose
that
already
my
spirithad
yielded
to
this
gloomy
prison
,
and
is
he
disappointed
to
find
thatI
<EOS>
still
live?”While
Ada
was
pursuing
these
reflections
,
Gray
suddenly
re
-
appeared
,
and
placing
a
ladder
from
the
opening
into
the
dungeon
,
he
said
,
in
avoice
intended
to
be
conciliatory,—“Ascend
<EOS>
,
Ada
—
ascend
.
<EOS>
”“I
can
meet
death
here
,
”
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“There
is
no
death
to
meet
,
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
I
mean
you
no
harm
.
”“Because
<EOS>
you
have
done
me
as
much
,
short
of
taking
my
life
,
”
said
Ada,“as
lies
in
your
power
.
<EOS>
By
what
right
—
by
what
flimsy
shadow
of
justiceam
<EOS>
I
immured
<EOS>
here?”“Ascend
<EOS>
I
say
,
”
cried
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
There
is
warmth
and
comfort
above
here
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
may
as
well
,
”
thought
Ada
,
with
a
shudder
,
“
meet
my
death
from
hishands
above
as
by
starvation
in
this
place
.
<EOS>
”She
<EOS>
placed
her
foot
upon
the
ladder
,
and
slowly
ascended
.
<EOS>
When
sheneared
the
top
,
Gray
reached
out
his
hand
,
and
assisted
her
into
theroom
in
which
he
was
.
<EOS>
“You
tremble
,
girl
!
”
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
“And
so
do
you
,
”
replied
Ada
,
fixing
her
eyes
upon
Jacob
Gray
’s
paleface
.
<EOS>
“You
<EOS>
—
you
think
I
mean
you
harm

”
he
said
,
in
a
hesitating
tone
,
andavoiding
Ada
’s
gaze
as
much
as
possible
.
<EOS>
“Think
!
”
<EOS>
repeated
Ada,—“think
,
Jacob
Gray!”“Jacob
Gray
?
”
<EOS>
he
cried
.
<EOS>
“
You

<EOS>
”“I

said
Ada

“I

”“You

Ada

with

<EOS>
gasped
Gray

<EOS>
“There

<EOS>
cried
Ada

<EOS>
“

”“Know

Gray

after

“I

”“By

shouted
Ada
,
her
face
kindling
with
excitement
,
and
herdelicate
form
appearing
to
dilate
as
she
pointed
to
the
abashed
andwrithing
countenance
of
the
villain
who
trembled
before
her
.
<EOS>
“Be

said
Gray
;
“

”“Come

<EOS>
cried
Gray

<EOS>
Ada
slowly
followed
him
from
the
room

<EOS>
Gray
passed
out
at
a
largedoorway
into
a
smaller
apartment
,
in
which
was
a
table
,
some
baskets
,
similar
to
those
Ada
had
seen
in
the
cellar
turned
up
for
seats
,
and
asmall
fire
dimly
burning
on
an
ample
hearth
;
before
which
a
bullockmight
have
been
roasted
,
and
perhaps
had
been
in
days
gone
by

<EOS>
“Ada
<EOS>
,
”
said
Gray
,
“
look
around
you

<EOS>
”Ada
did
so
,
and
Gray
continued,—“This
is
a
place
of
discomfort

there
is
little
to

it

itis
preferable

yon

”“I

said
Ada

<EOS>
“Your

Ada
had
seen
too
often
the
nervous
terrors
of
Jacob
Gray
to
feel
muchalarm
at
his
present
emotion

and
<EOS>
she
merely
replied,—“The
man
I

it

stand

plead
with
Heaven

by

waved
his

several
times

speaking

as
if

implore

cease

wanted
power

stop

When

ceased
speaking

she
stood
with
clasped
handsgazing
in

face

waiting
with
a
deep

holy
anxiety

On

your

Perhaps

”Ada
<EOS>
sank
into
a
seat

a
feeling
of
despair
came
over

There

Saveyourself

Ada

felt
that
all

was
useless

she
wept
bitterly
asthe
dreary
future
presented
itself
to
her
as
a
protracted
imprisonment
,
or
a
speedy
and
cruel
death

<EOS>
Gray
watched
her
keenly
,
and
advancing
close
to
her
,
he
whispered
inher
ear,—“Ada

dashing
the

from

impatiently

“
The

”She
<EOS>
burst
into
tears

and
wept
bitterly

<EOS>
The
name
of
Albert
mingledwith
her
sobs
,
for

felt
now
that

was
separated
from

”Ada
sat
silent
and
spirit

broken
in

lonely

<EOS>
A
weight
seemedto
hang
upon

heart

even
hope

that
one

appeared
to

had
brought

Gray
slouching
his

over

and
drawinghis

closely
around

left

<EOS>
Vice
,
by

have
its

<EOS>
Truly
may
we
say
,
“
The
wicked
triumph
for
a
season
,
”
and
by
somestrange
combination
of
circumstances
,
notwithstanding
the
turbulence
,
the
anxiety
,
and
the
danger
of
Learmont
’s
early
days
in
the
metropolis
,
matters
so
arranged
themselves
,
or
were
arranged
for
wise
purposes
bythe
great
Dispenser
of
all
things
,
that
from
the
day
on
which
Ada
madeher
promise
to
Jacob
Gray
,
Learmont
had
prospered
in
his
career
ofvillany
.
<EOS>
His
natural
sagacity
had
told
him
,
that
now
Jacob
Gray
was
putupon
his
guard
,
any
further
open
attempt
against
his
life
would
beattended
with
great
danger
;
and
might
possibly
have
the
effect
ofdriving
him
to
some
desperate
measure
of
retaliation
and
revenge
,
whichmight
involve
both
.
<EOS>
From
a
deep
and
careful
review
,
therefore
,
of
thewhole
of
circumstances
by
which
he
was
surrounded
,
the
criminal
andunscrupulous
squire
decided
upon
a
safer
,
although
more
expensive
andprotracted
course
of
action
,
than
he
had
hitherto
pursued
;
that
was
,
tocontinually
tempt
Gray
by
large
offers
to
give
up
the
supposed
boy
,
together
with
his
own
confession
,
and
go
to
some
foreign
land
to
spendthe
earnings
of
his
criminality
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
,
with
the
cunning
which
formed
such
an
ingredient
in
hischaracter
,
favoured
this
idea
on
the
part
of
Learmont
,
by
apparentlyalways
hesitating
upon
his
offers
,
while
at
the
same
time
he
hadthoroughly
and
entirely
made
up
his
mind
not
to
accept
them
;
feeling
,
as
he
did
,
that
his
life
would
not
be
worth
a
minute
<EOS>
’s
purchase
afterhe
had
declared
Ada
’s
sex
,
and
given
her
up
together
with
his
writtenconfession
.
<EOS>
Learmont
at
the
same
time
was
not
neglectful
of
the
chance
thatcontinually
presented
itself
of
discovering
Gray
’s
place
of
abode
,
andpouncing
upon
him
some
night
unawares
,
and
wresting
from
him
both
theboy
and
the
confession
,
at
the
same
time
that
he
glutted
his
hatred
byputting
him
to
death
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
for
once
in
his
life
had
been
injudicious
when
he
told
Adathat
he
only
waited
for
a
certain
amount
of
gold
before
he
gratifiedhis
revenge
by
declaring
who
and
what
she
was
.
<EOS>
He
really
had
decidedupon
such
a
course
.
<EOS>
The
taunts
and
undisguised
contempt
of
Learmont
hadawakened
a
revengeful
spirit
in
his
breast
,
while
the
attempt
to
murderhim
in
the
old
house
at
Lambeth
inflamed
to
perfect
fury
,
and
made
,
asit
were
,
part
of
his
very
nature
.
<EOS>
Learmont
laboured
under
considerable
difficulty
in
any
attempts
hemight
make
to
trace
Jacob
Gray
to
his
abode
,
in
consequence
of
theimpossibility
of
trusting
any
one
to
do
the
office
of
spy
upon
him
,
except
the
smith
or
himself
.
<EOS>
To
the
smith
,
Britton
,
there
were
manyweighty
objections
now
.
<EOS>
Intoxication
was
doing
its
work
,
and
moreoverGray
knew
him
so
well
.
<EOS>
Learmont
therefore
felt
that
henceforwardBritton
could
be
no
useful
agent
in
any
attempt
to
discover
the
retreatof
Gray
.
<EOS>
Then
for
him
,
Learmont
himself
,
to
dog
the
footsteps
of
the
cautiousvillain
from
his
own
house
,
was
an
undertaking
full
of
difficulty
.
<EOS>
Thevery
haste
with
which
he
would
have
had
to
attire
himself
for
thestreet
had
its
objections
;
and
were
Gray
to
come
some
day
byappointment
,
and
find
him
ready
equipped
to
follow
him
,
would
not
hisextremely
suspicious
mind
at
once
conclude
the
object?Thus
<EOS>
the
task
of
following
Jacob
Gray
became
one
of
no
ordinarydifficulty
,
and
Learmont
wasted
many
months
in
trying
to
dissuadehimself
from
persevering
in
his
present
course
,
and
take
a
large
sum
atonce
;
expatriating
himself
immediately
afterwards
,
which
,
by
-
the
-
by
,
Learmont
never
for
one
moment
intended
to
permit
him
to
do
,
for
hewould
have
slaughtered
him
upon
his
own
marble
steps
rather
than
allowhim
to
escape
,
the
moment
he
could
do
so
with
no
other
danger
than
thatto
be
encountered
from
the
mere
fact
of
taking
a
life
,
in
justificationof
which
he
would
easily
have
found
some
plausible
excuse
,
ifquestioned
concerning
the
act
by
the
laws
.
<EOS>
Not
a
week
passed
without
a
visit
from
Gray
,
and
at
each
he
alwayscarried
away
as
much
as
he
could
wring
from
Learmont
’s
policy
or
hisfears
.
<EOS>
But
how
truly
did
poor
Ada
say
that
the
love
of
gold
was
a
passionwhich
grew
if
it
was
fed
.
<EOS>
Already
had
Gray
received
from
Learmont
a
sumfar
exceeding
that
which
he
had
first
fixed
in
his
mind
as
what
wouldcontent
<EOS>
him
ere
<EOS>
he
sought
his
revenge
.
<EOS>
Still
,
however
,
he
lingered
,
andas
each
visit
to
Squire
Learmont
<EOS>
’s
mansion
added
something
to
hisstore
,
he
could
not
bring
his
mind
to
stop
in
time
.
<EOS>
Day
after
day
—
weekafter
week
—
month
succeeding
month
—
he
still
hoarded
,
saying
over
tohimself,—“Not
yet
—
not
yet
!
<EOS>
I
will
have
more
gold
ere
<EOS>
I
have
my
revenge
.
<EOS>
”The
smith
,
too
,
was
to
Learmont
ever
a
sight
of
terror
.
<EOS>
He
still
livedat
the
Chequers
,
close
to
Learmont
’s
mansion
;
and
he
,
too
,
paidperiodical
visits
to
the
proud
squire
,
although
his
demands
wereinsignificant
in
comparison
with
those
of
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
While
a
few
guineas
sufficed
for
the
coarse
vices
,
the
drunkenness
,
andthe
debaucheries
of
the
smith
,
Jacob
Gray
was
not
satisfied
unless
heincreased
his
hidden
store
by
a
large
sum
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
although
the
smith
’s
eternal
“
message
from
the
Old
Smithy
“
gratedupon
his
very
soul
,
Learmont
did
not
feel
that
intensity
of
hatred
toBritton
that
he
did
to
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
he
made
frequent
offers
to
Britton
to
quit
the
country
,
and
give
up
to
him
certain
papers
which
,
on
the
night
of
the
murder
atthe
Old
Smithy
,
had
been
by
Britton
taken
from
the
corpse
of
him
whomet
his
death
within
that
ill
-
named
pile
.
<EOS>
These
papers
were
of
as
much
importance
to
Learmont
as
any
could
wellbe
;
for
if
they
did
not
prove
his
illegitimacy
,
they
raised
the
pointso
strongly
that
had
he
stood
alone
as
the
last
and
only
heir
to
thevast
estates
of
Learmont
,
he
could
scarcely
have
established
his
claim
.
<EOS>
Of
this
he
was
assured
by
Gray
,
who
would
himself
have
gloried
in
thepossession
of
such
a
document
,
but
he
dared
not
take
them
from
thebody
;
hence
they
fell
,
knowingly
by
him
,
into
the
hands
of
Britton
.
<EOS>
It
was
likewise
constantly
urged
by
Britton
that
he
,
too
,
had
aconfession
written
,
and
in
pursuance
of
his
word
,
had
rolled
it
roundthe
knife
of
Jacob
Gray
,
which
the
latter
had
left
behind
him
at
thesmithy
in
the
body
of
his
victim
.
<EOS>
For
a
long
time
it
had
become
an
object
with
Learmont
to
discover
fromBritton
where
he
kept
such
important
documents
,
determining
,
should
hefind
out
,
to
make
some
desperate
effort
by
fraud
or
violence
to
possesshimself
of
them
;
but
the
smith
constantly
and
pertinaciously
eluded
themost
artful
inquiries
,
and
Learmont
could
obtain
no
clue
to
where
theywere
concealed
,
although
by
Britton
<EOS>
’s
manner
<EOS>
he
felt
satisfied
theywere
not
at
the
Chequers
.
<EOS>
Still
he
feared
to
do
violence
to
Britton
,
lest
he
might
have
adopted
some
means
of
bringing
them
to
light
afterhis
decease
.
<EOS>
Never
probably
were
three
persons
placed
by
a
curious
train
ofcircumstances
in
such
strange
relation
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
Learmont
hating
the
two
accomplices
of
his
guilt
,
and
not
deterred
bythe
slightest
compunctions
of
conscience
from
taking
their
lives
if
hedared
,
yet
placed
in
so
singular
a
position
with
regard
to
them
,
<EOS>
thathe
trembled
at
the
idea
of
any
accident
or
sudden
illness
deprivingeither
of
them
of
existence
,
as
such
an
event
might
bring
to
light
thedocuments
by
which
they
held
themselves
safe
from
assassination
at
hishands
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
received
large
sums
of
money
which
he
dare
not
use
,
andtrembled
with
apprehensions
from
day
to
day
lest
his
miserable
retreatin
the
marshes
of
Battersea
should
be
discovered
,
yet
with
a
species
ofinsanity
lingered
on
with
an
unquenchable
thirst
of
adding
to
his
storeof
gold
before
he
began
the
enjoyment
of
a
single
guinea
of
it
.
<EOS>
Britton
,
the
reckless
savage
smith
,
was
the
only
one
of
these
three
menwho
in
his
own
brutal
manner
enjoyed
the
fruits
of
his
crimes
.
<EOS>
Hefeasted
,
drank
,
and
led
a
life
of
awful
and
reckless
debauchery
fromday
to
day
—
defying
the
future
and
drowning
the
present
in
a
sea
ofintoxication
.
<EOS>
And
now
let
us
speak
of
Ada
—
the
young
,
the
beautiful
,
the
persecutedAda
—
who
now
for
many
weary
months
had
endured
the
solitary
andmiserable
life
of
a
captive
in
the
little
house
at
Battersea
.
<EOS>
From
time
to
time
Jacob
Gray
had
enforced
a
renewal
of
the
girl’spromise
not
to
escape
from
her
state
of
bondage
;
and
who
,
under
similarcircumstances
,
would
have
refused
the
pledge
when
death
was
the
onlyalternative
?
<EOS>
Life
to
all
is
dear
and
precious
—
it
is
the
one
possessionto
which
mankind
fondly
clings
under
all
privations
—
all
sufferings
.
<EOS>
Roblife
of
all
its
joys
—
clothe
it
in
misery
—
attack
the
frame
in
whichlingers
by
disease
and
unceasing
pain
;
still
,
while
the
brain
retainsits
healthy
action
,
there
will
be
a
clinging
to
life
—
to
mere
vitality
,
which
is
in
human
nature
a
feeling
altogether
independent
of
all
thatmakes
up
the
pains
or
joys
of
existence
.
<EOS>
But
if
life
is
thus
clung
towith
a
desperate
reluctance
to
quit
it
by
the
aged
,
the
diseased
,
andthe
hopeless
,
how
much
greater
must
be
its
charms
to
the
young
,
healthful
,
ardent
,
and
enthusiastic
spirit
that
in
its
young
existenceseems
almost
immortal!Ada
was
unhappy
—
miserable
,
but
she
had
not
yet
done
with
hope
;
shecould
not
say
,
take
my
life
,
Jacob
Gray
,
<EOS>
for
I
will
promise
no
more;that
would
have
been
a
species
of
moral
suicide
from
which
she
shrankaghast
;
and
feeling
,
from
Gray
’s
manner
,
a
firm
conviction
that
he
didspeak
the
truth
when
he
declared
that
her
death
or
life
were
alikeindifferent
to
him
,
except
so
far
as
the
former
placed
him
in
a
lessdangerous
position
,
and
the
latter
would
eventually
gratify
some
wildfeelings
of
revenge
against
some
one
,
she
did
go
on
from
month
to
monthpromising
that
she
would
make
no
effort
to
escape
,
and
still
hopingthat
a
day
of
deliverance
was
near
,
till
the
hue
of
health
began
tofade
upon
her
cheeks
,
and
she
felt
that
dreadful
sinking
of
the
heartwhich
ever
waits
on
hope
deferred
.
<EOS>
We
have
now
another
person
in
our
dramatis
personæ
to
speak
of
,
andthat
is
the
gallant
,
young
,
and
enthusiastic
Albert
Seyton
.
<EOS>
The
sudden
and
mysterious
disappearance
of
Ada
had
struck
deeply
uponhis
heart
,
and
after
about
a
fortnight
’s
hopeless
search
throughLondon
,
during
which
he
endured
immense
fatigue
,
and
scarcely
took
anynourishment
to
sustain
his
exhausted
frame
,
he
was
seized
with
anillness
which
brought
him
to
the
point
of
death
,
and
from
which
herecovered
but
very
slowly
,
although
a
good
constitution
and
theaffectionate
solicitude
of
his
father
at
length
triumphed
over
thedisease
.

CHAPTER
XXVII.Learmont
at
Home.—The
Baronetcy.—A
Visitor.—The
Rejected
Offer
.
<EOS>
A
rich
,
glowing
summer
’s
sun
was
shining
through
the
stained
glass
in
alarge
window
of
one
of
the
principal
rooms
in
the
mansion
of
Learmont
.
<EOS>
The
very
air
seemed
filled
with
glorious
tints
,
rivalling
in
hues
ofgorgeous
beauty
the
brightest
refulgence
of
the
rainbow
.
<EOS>
The
songs
ofbirds
from
the
gardens
came
sweetly
to
the
ear
:
a
dreamy
stillness
,
such
as
is
often
to
be
observed
towards
the
close
of
some
delicioussummer
day
,
seemed
to
pervade
all
things
.
<EOS>
He
,
however
,
who
sat
in
thatrichly
-
decked
apartment
,
had
no
ear
for
the
melodies
of
nature
;
for
himthe
glorious
sunlight
had
no
romantic
charms
.
<EOS>
His
brow
was
knit
withanxious
care
—
deep
furrows
were
on
his
cheeks
,
and
a
nervous
irritationof
manner
betrayed
the
heart
ill
at
ease
.
<EOS>
It
was
Squire
Learmont
himself
who
thus
sat
at
the
close
of
thatsummer
’s
day
,
and
the
change
in
his
appearance
since
we
last
presentedhim
to
the
reader
was
so
great
that
it
might
have
been
supposed
manyyears
had
passed
over
his
head
instead
of
the
comparatively
short
timethat
had
actually
elapsed
.
<EOS>
His
lank
black
hair
was
thickly
mingled
withgrey
tints
,
and
the
sallow
of
his
complexion
had
changed
more
and
moreto
a
sickly
awful
white
,
such
as
might
be
supposed
to
sit
upon
thecountenance
of
one
risen
from
the
grave
.
<EOS>
He
sat
for
a
long
time
silent
,
although
his
lips
moved
as
if
he
weremuttering
to
himself
something
that
formed
the
principal
subject
of
hismeditation
.
<EOS>
“Well
,
”
he
suddenly
said
,
half
aloud
,
“
if
I
have
made
so
great
aninroad
in
my
accumulated
wealth
as
to
reduce
it
by
one
-
fourth
of
itswhole
amount
,
I
have
achieved
something
—
ay
,
a
great
deal
,
for
I
havemade
the
first
step
up
the
ladder
of
nobility
.
<EOS>
This
baronetcy
that
ispromised
me
is
what
I
suggested
to
myself
long
since
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
that
is
thecommencement
of
power
,
the
limit
of
which
who
shall
define
—
then
amarriage
—
one
of
those
marriages
of
convenience
on
one
side
and
ambitionon
the
other
.
<EOS>
My
wealth
will
make
me
a
most
acceptable
suitor
to
somebranch
of
a
noble
family
,
whose
peerage
will
look
all
the
better
for
anew
coat
of
gilding
.
<EOS>
Humph
,
what
says
the
minister?”He
took
from
the
table
before
him
a
note
which
lay
open
,
and
read
itslowly
and
distinctly
.
<EOS>
It
ran
thus;—There
can
be
no
doubt
of
his
Majesty
’s
most
gracious
inclination
toconfer
a
baronetcy
upon
you
,
without
the
slightest
reference
to
yourpatriotic
and
disinterested
offer
to
purchase
the
means
of
occupyingsix
seats
in
the
lower
house
.
<EOS>
The
matter
may
be
well
concluded
thispresent
week
.
<EOS>
“May
it
?
”
<EOS>
muttered
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“
It
shall
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
one
who
brooks
delays
.
<EOS>
I
have
paid
dearly
for
my
baronetcy
,
and
I
will
have
it
.
<EOS>
Those
sixseats
have
cost
me
thrice
their
sums
in
thousands
—
ay
,
more
than
that
.
<EOS>
There
can
indeed
be
no
doubt
of
the
gracious
intentions
of
his
Majesty;that
business
is
settled
.
<EOS>
I
am
to
all
intents
and
purposes
even
now
abaronet
—
I
have
paid
the
price
,
and
,
thank
the
Fates
,
this
is
a
countrywhere
<EOS>
all
things
have
a
price
,
nobility
included
;
and
now
,
how
muchlonger
am
I
to
be
tortured
by
these
rascals
,
Gray
and
Britton
?
<EOS>
Mybitterest
curses
on
them
both
.
<EOS>
Gray
’s
<EOS>
demands
increase
each
time
hecomes
here
;
his
love
of
gold
is
insatiable
,
and
he
never
relaxes
in
hiscaution
.
<EOS>
How
on
earth
to
cope
with
that
man
I
know
not
.
<EOS>
Must
I
ever
bethe
victim
of
his
avarice
until
some
day
he
dies
,
leaving
behind
himthat
which
might
condemn
me
?
<EOS>
No
;
this
must
,
can
not
last
.
<EOS>
Too
longalready
have
I
groaned
under
the
weight
of
this
man
’s
hideous
presence
,
and
frequent
visits
.
<EOS>
Some
bold
or
hazardous
scheme
must
rid
me
of
him;and
,
too
,
he
peremptorily
refuses
aught
to
do
with
the
destruction
ofBritton
.
<EOS>
He
thinks
the
job
too
dangerous
,
and
taunts
me
with
the
sneerthat
he
gets
of
me
already
<EOS>
what
gold
he
chooses
to
demand
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
,
beware
.
<EOS>
Some
accident
may
yet
arise
to
place
you
at
my
mercy
—
my
mercy?Ha
!
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
if
I
could
invent
some
torture
—
some
—
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
What
now?”“Master
<EOS>
Gray
desires
speech
of
your
worship
,
”
said
a
servant
.
<EOS>
In
a
moment
Gray
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
Anxiety
of
mind
,
and
the
necessityof
constant
caution
,
had
had
all
their
effect
upon
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
Hestooped
considerably
,
and
moved
along
with
a
slow
,
silent
,
shufflingtread
,
as
if
he
feared
the
very
sound
of
his
own
footsteps
would
betrayhim
.
<EOS>
He
peered
into
the
face
of
Learmont
from
his
half
-
closed
eyes
,
andthen
gently
sliding
to
a
seat
,
he
said
,
in
a
half
whisper,—“Well
,
squire
,
<EOS>
how
fares
it
with
<EOS>
you?”“Indifferently
well
,
Jacob
Gray
,
”
said
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“
You
look
pale
andill
.
<EOS>
”“No

no

”
<EOS>
said
Gray
,
quickly
,
“
<EOS>
I

very
well

quite
well

Ishall

JacobGray

<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
yet
so
strong

”
said
Gray
,
trembling
,
<EOS>
his
small
eyes
fixed
atLearmont
,
“
that
those
who
would
destroy
me
dare
not
lay
a
finger

violence!”“I
<EOS>

your
taunt

said
Learmont
;
<EOS>
“
it
has
long
been
settledbetween
us

I

not
take
your
life

Jacob

<EOS>
But
even
now
,
will
nothing
tempt
you
to
conclude
a
business
which
is
slowly

hurrying
you
to
the
grave?”“Squire
Learmont

”
said
Gray
calmly
,
“
it

I

I

<EOS>
You
understand

,
<EOS>
Squire
Learmont?”“’Twere
needless
to
affect
to
be
ignorant
of

you
thinkthat

Jacob

<EOS>
There
was
a
time
<EOS>
,
I
admit

when
I
pantedfor

I

”“Humph

said
Gray
,
“

”Learmont
<EOS>
bit
his
lips

bent
a
scowl
of
such
fierce
hatred
at
Gray

that

“
Hem

<EOS>
Squire
Learmont
,
some
time
since
I
listened
toyour
proposals
for
the
death
of
Britton
,
the
savage
smith

I
agreedwith
you
that
his
love
of
drink
should
be
the
means
used
to
lure
him
todestruction
.
<EOS>
The
plan
was
thus
to
stultify
his
judgment
and
never
veryactive
caution
by
the
strong
stimulants
he
so
dotes
on
,
till
I
woundfrom
him
the
secret
of
where
he
kept
the
papers
,
you
know

and
theconfession
,
if
indeed
he
had
written
one
—
a
fact
I
always
doubted
;
andthen
a
subtle
poison
in
his
cup
would
remove
him
for
ever

Look
ye
,
sir
;
had
I
obtained
the
paperswhich
prove
,
as
I
well
know
,
your
illegitimacy
,
and
bar
you
for

possessing

be
assured
I
should
have

<EOS>
”“Kept
<EOS>
them
,
Gray?”“Ay
,
kept
them
.
<EOS>
”“But
<EOS>
you
had
—
you
have
—
sufficient
hold
on
me
already
,
in
the
person
<EOS>
ofthat
boy
.
<EOS>
”“A
hold
<EOS>
I
had
,

scarcely
sufficient

squire

<EOS>
I
am
as
a

in

<EOS>
The
boy
is
a
great
thing
;
a
valuable
property
;
but
human
life
isuncertain
,
and
the
Squire
of
Learmont
deep
and
bold
.
<EOS>
”“What
<EOS>
mean
<EOS>
you?”“I
mean
,
that
I
have
lived
upon
the
rack
!
<EOS>
“
said
Gray
,
his
pale
facequivering
with
emotion
.
<EOS>
“
Was
I
not
by
you
watched
,
hunted
like
a
wildbeast
to
my
lair
?
<EOS>
You
know
I
was
;
and
the
possession
of
these
paperswould
have
made
me
sleep
more
soundly
at
night
<EOS>
,
for
it
would
scarcelyhave
been
prudent
of
you
to
hunt
a
man
who
possessed
such
certain
meansof
disinheriting
you
,
even
although
you
had
paved
your
path
to
wealthwith
oceans
of

<EOS>
I
tell
you
I
would
possess
these
papers

<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
what
benefit
would
the
death
of
Britton
have
been
to
me
,
then?”Gray
smiled
hideously
as
he
replied,—“It
is
always
better
to
consolidate
debts
,
Squire
Learmont
;
you
wouldhave
had
one
creditor
then
,
instead
of
two
.
<EOS>
Then
,
likewise
,
I
wouldhave
sold
you
the

left
England
forever

<EOS>
”“Indeed?”“Yes
;
with
the
papers
.
<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
yet
,
”
said
Learmont
,
after
a
pause
,
“
with
all
these
advantages
toyou
resulting
from
the
deed

you
refuse

prosecute
the

I
am
quite
sure
that
you
can
do
.
<EOS>
”“Hem
!
”
said
Gray
,
and
<EOS>
his
small
eyes
twinkled
as
he
fixed
them
upon
thecountenance
of
the
squire
.
<EOS>
“
There
is
an
old
fable
of

fightingfor

ofcontention

<EOS>
Squire
Learmont
,
you
are
scarcely
yet
a

for

was
silent
,
and
Gray
laughed
,
and
then
started
in
alarm
at
theunwonted
sound
of
his
own
mirth
.
<EOS>
“You
spoke
of
two
reasons
for
the
death
of
Britton
,
”
said
Learmont
,
after
a
pause
of
several
minutes
’
duration
.
<EOS>
“Ay
,
”
said
Gray
,
“
I
did
,
and
there
I
was
indiscreet

<EOS>
My
second
reasonwas
,
revenge
.
<EOS>
I
hated
Britton
.
<EOS>
I
still
hate
him

<EOS>
I
—
<EOS>
I
loathe
him
;
and
mydeep
hatred
,
the
direful
spirit
of
my
revenge
,
urged
me
to
run
somelittle
risk
to
gratify
it

<EOS>
I
knew
your
policy
—
I
saw
it
as
clearly
asthe
sun
at

<EOS>
But
I
was
a
little
blinded
by
my
revenge
,
and
Idid
make
an
attempt
to
get
the
savage
smith
in
my
toils
.
<EOS>
”“You
failed?”“Yes
,
because
you
were
too
hasty
in
your
wish
to
get
rid
of
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
You
recollect
the
Bishop’s

walk
on
a
certain
frosty
morning
<EOS>
some

Bishop’s

walk?”“Yes
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
man
who
would
have
assisted
me
in
the
destruction
ofBritton
.
<EOS>
You
,
Squire

,
left
that
man

”“I

<EOS>
exclaimed
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“Yes
<EOS>
you

<EOS>
I
did
not
see
you
do
the
deed

but
after
some
thought
I
couldstake
my
life
upon
the
fact
that
Sheldon

the
Thames
waterman
,
came
byhis
death
from
your
sword
.
<EOS>
Thus
it
was
squire
;
that
man
was
tempted
byme
to
assist
in
the
murder
of
Britton
.
<EOS>
Curiosity
,
or
breach
of
faith
,
induced
him
to
dog
my
footsteps
to
the
lonely
house
in
which
you
and
Iand
Britton
had
the
pleasant
interview
at
midnight
.
<EOS>
”Learmont
made
a
gesture
of
impatience
,
and
Gray
proceeded
.
<EOS>
“You
note
how
candid
and
explanatory
<EOS>
I
am
;
it
is
not
worth
my

<EOS>
By
some
means
then

I

you
met
with

<EOS>
He
told
you

you
murdered

”Learmont
<EOS>
bit
his
lips
with
passion
.
<EOS>
“That

awakened
me

added
Gray

<EOS>
“
<EOS>
Oh

It

me

“Then

were

and
Heaven
sent
visions

joy

gushing
tenderness
touphold
and
comfort
that
young

beautiful

in
her
solitude

<EOS>
Theday
might
be
gloomy

and
the
old
lone
house
dispiriting
and
cheerless

but
the
fancy

when

took
its
airy
flight
,
and
,
Heaven
-
directed

laid
in
stores

beauty
and
food

<EOS>
Ada
had
kept
her
word
with
Gray
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
once
passed
thethreshold
of
that
lonely
abode
,
and
she
had
renewed
her
promise
fromtime
to
time
,
although
with
many
tears
;
but
she
would
not
throw
awaythe
life
that
God
had
given
,
so
she
lived
on
,
illumined
in
her
heart
bythe
<EOS>
hope
that
the
day
would
come
when
her
dreams
would
become
reality
,
and
her
present
reality
seem
to
her
<EOS>
but
as
the
fevered
imaginings
of
adream!From
some
hidden
place
in
her
prison
-
house
,
she
would
sometimes
lookout
for
hours
together
upon
the
blue
sky
,
and
envy
the
wild
birds
asthey
winged
their
free
and
happy
flight
far
,
far
away
in
the
liquiddepths
of
the
blue
arch
that
spanned
the
world
.
<EOS>
She
would
listen
,
too
,
to
the
song
of
the
aspiring
lark
as
it
flew
up
—
up
towards
heaven
,
untilit
became
but
a
small
speck
in
the
sky
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
delight
to
Ada
;
andto
her
imaginative
mind
nothing
could
be
sweeter
music
than
the
slowlydecreasing
cadences
of
that
wild
,
happy
song
of
the
lark
as
in
its
veryrecklessness
of
joy
it
leaves
the
earth
so
far
behind
.
<EOS>
Far
away
sometimes
in
the
open
fields
she
would
see
some
one
pickinghis
or
her
way
along
the
swampy
ground
,
and
she
blessed
the
sight
offany
other
human
face
than
Gray’s
.
<EOS>
Then
in
the
old
house
there
were
insects
—
crawling
things
,
which
in
thegreat
world
are
despised
and
put
to
death
because
we
can
not
see
theirbeauties
,
nor
appreciate
their
pains
;
but
Ada
,
with
a
simple
andbeautiful
theology
,
taught
her
by
her
own
heart
,
and
culled
from
thefew
books
she
had
read
,
feared
not
these
creatures
,
for
she
looked
uponthem
all
with
a
kindly
spirit
,
as
being
the
creations
of
the
same
GreatBeing
who
had
made
the
mountains
,
the
wondrous
ocean
,
and
all
theliving
,
breathing
things
of
earthy
,
sea
and
air
.
<EOS>
So
in
course
of
time
the
very
mice
would
come
forth
at
the
sound
of
hervoice
and
eat
from
her
hand
,
peering
at
her
from
their
bright
twinklingeyes
,
without
fear
.
<EOS>
Ada
shrunk
from
no
living
thing
but
Jacob
Gray
,
and
him
<EOS>
she
avoided
asmuch
as
possible
.
<EOS>
He
always
brought
home
with
him
food
enough
for
theirwants
,
and
Ada
took
her
portion
in
silence
.
<EOS>
There
was
one
small
roomwhich
she
had
appropriated
to
her
own
use
,
and
into
that
room
sheforbade
Jacob
Gray
to
enter
.
<EOS>
Wicked
and
ruthless
as
he
was
,
that
younggirl
had
acquired
a
kind
of
moral
control
over
him
which
he
could
notshake
off
.
<EOS>
They
never
conversed
.
<EOS>
They
had
no
discussions
.
<EOS>
Their
wholeintercourse
resolved
itself
to
this:—That
he
would
murder
her
if
shedid
not
promise
to
abide
where
she
was
without
making
an
effort
toescape
,
and
she
,
having
promised
so
much
,
was
otherwise
a
free
agent
,
and
under
no
sort
of
control
from
him
.
<EOS>
Thus
the
seasons
had
rolled
on
,
and
Ada
had
marked
the
subsidence
ofwinter
and
the
budding
beauty“Of
<EOS>
the
sweet
spring
-
time,”from
her
lonely
home
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
Jacob
Gray
would
be
absent
for
a
whole
day
,
and
Ada
was
gladhe
stayed
away
,
for
she
would
then
sing
to
herself
old
ballads
whichwere
dear
to
her
,
because
the
book
from
which

lent
to
her
by
Albert
Seyton
.
<EOS>
But
when
she
heard
his
well
-
knownsignal
of
return
,
she
went
to
her
own
room
,
and
sung
no
more
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
toa
certain
extent
,
Ada
enjoyed
the
glorious
summer
,
although
she
couldnot
wander
in
the
green
fields
,
or
lose
herself
among
shady
trees
.
<EOS>
Thesoft
genial
air
,
however
,
visited
the
ill

omened
house
at
Battersea
,
asfreely
as
it
blew
its
sweets
in
at
the
windows
of
a
palace
,
and
thesewere
moments
when
Ada
felt
most
happy
.
<EOS>
Gray
,
when
he
remained
out
the
whole
day
,
never
mentioned
to
Ada
hisintention
of
so
doing
;
but
she
knew
that
if
the
day
fully
dawned
and
hecame
not
,
that
he
would
wait
until
the
shades
of
evening
rendered
itsafe
for
him
to
cross
the
fields
without
the
risk
of
observation
.
<EOS>
On
these
occasions
it
seemed
to
Ada
as
if
she
was
half
liberated
fromher
prison
,
so
grateful
to
her
was
the
absence
of
Jacob
Gray
;
and
afterseeing
the
day
fairly
commenced
,
and
rambling
through
the
old
housewithout
encountering
the
object
of
her
dread
and
dislike
<EOS>
,
she
wouldfeel
comparatively
happy
.
<EOS>
It
was
on
one
of
these
occasions
that
we
propose
conducting
our
readersto
the
Lone
House
at
Battersea
.
<EOS>
Gray
had
gone
out
the
preceding
evening
at
sunset
,
and
the
morning
camewithout
bringing
him
back
again
.
<EOS>
A
glorious
morning
it
was
—
full
oflife
,
beauty
,
and
sunshine
.
<EOS>
The
summer
air
blew
sweetly
into
thechamber
of
the
lovely
girl
;
but
the
very
murmuring
of
the
soft
breezewas
company
to
her
,
and
the
twitter
of
the
happy
birds
as
they
flewpast
the
old
house
fell
like
Nature
’s
own
music
,
as
indeed
it
was
,
uponher
innocent
heart
.
<EOS>
Hastily
dressing
herself
she
rose
,
and
with
a
slow
,
cautious
step
,
descended
to
Gray
’s
sitting
-
room
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
there
.
<EOS>
Here
she
stood
fora
few
minutes
upon
the
principal
staircase
,
and
listened
attentively
.
<EOS>
No
sound
disturbed
the
repose
that
dwelt
in
that
house
.
<EOS>
Ada
smiled
.
<EOS>
“He
has
not
returned
,
”
she
cried
;
“
I
shall
have
a
whole
day
to
myself
.
<EOS>
A
whole
day
,
in
which
to
sing
over
my
old
songs
,
to
converse
with
thebirds
,
to
feed
the
mice
and
insects
that
abound
here
;
and
I
think
theyhave
learnt
to
know
me
now
,
and
love
me
in
their
way
,
and
according
totheir
several
natures
.
<EOS>
”The
day
wore
on
,
but
it
was
scarcely
wearisome
to
Ada
.
’
<EOS>
Tis
true
shesometimes
wept
when
she
thought
how
cruelly
she
was
situated
;
but
thenshe
would
soon
smile
again
,
and
sitting
opposite
to
an
open
window
,
shewould
gaze
for
a
long
time
upon
the
clear
blue
sky
,
and
speculate
uponthe
various
forms
of
the
light
fleecy
vapours
that
imparted
anadditional
charm
to
the
sky
,
by
partially
concealing
some
of
itsbeauties
.
<EOS>
Then
she
thought
of
those
who
were
dear
to
her
—
of
AlbertSeyton
—
of
his
father
—
of
the
poor
woman
who
had
spoken
a
few
kind
wordsto
her
at
the
little
milk
-
shop
at
Westminster
.
<EOS>
To
those
who
have
beenaccustomed
to
harshness
,
with
what
a
freshening
joy
<EOS>
the
recollection
ofa
few
words
kindly
spoken
comes
upon
the
mind
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
if
the
rich
andpowerful
—
those
who
are
living
in
high
places
,
and
revelling
inluxury
—
did
but
know
how
delightful
to
the
bruised
heart
but
a
fewsimple
words
of
common
courtesy
are
,
they
would
themselves
feel
apleasure
in
speaking
them
,
such
as
all
the
adulation
of
theirflatterers
—
all
the
glitter
of
their
homes
—
all
the
gaudy
insignia
oftheir
rank
can
never
bestow
upon
them
.
<EOS>
Ada
wept
with
grateful
joybecause
that
poor
woman
spoke
but
a
few
short
sentences
of
kindness

<EOS>
As
Ada
sat
in
an
attitude
of
deep
musing
,
and
her
long
silken
eyelasheswere
wet
with
the
tears
starting
to
her
eyes
,
a
confused
murmuringsound
from
afar
off
came
faintly
to
her
ears
.
<EOS>
She
started
,
for
in
thatsolitude
any
direct
or
tangible
sounds
from
the
great
world
withoutwere
strange
and
new
.
<EOS>
Bending
forward
in
an
attitude
of
listening
,
the
young
girl
endeavouredto
catch
the
purport
of
the
unwonted
disturbance
.
<EOS>
Still
nothing
but
faint
mingled
cries
and
shouts
came
to
her
ear
;
shecould
hear
no
words
distinctly
,
but
,
from
the
general
tone
of
thecries
,
she
guessed
they
were
those
of
derision
and
contempt
.
<EOS>
So
faintly
were
they
borne
across
the
fields
,
that
had
not
the
lightwinds
blown
steadily
in
that
direction
,
<EOS>
no
sound
of
all
the
uproariousvoices
,
that
were
so
mingled
together
in
strange
confusion
,
would
havereached
the
ears
of
the
solitary
prisoner
.
<EOS>
Nearer
and
nearer
,
however
,
came
the
sounds
;
and
Ada
went
to
thehighest
floor
in
the
house
,
the
windows
of
which
commanded
an
extensiveview
in
all
directions
.
<EOS>
Close
down
by
the
river
’s
side
she
could
nowdiscern
a
disorderly
rabble
,
apparently
pursuing
another
object
.
<EOS>
Shesaw
the
action
of
casting
stones
,
and
shouts
,
shrieks
,
loud
laughter
,
and
every
kind
of
noise
which
the
human
voice
is
capable
of
producingcame
each
moment
more
distinctly
to
her
ear
.
<EOS>
That
the
crowd
were
pursuing
and
pelting
some
object
of
popular
scornor
hatred
she
could
easily
perceive
.
<EOS>
Foremost
,
there
appeared
a
strangecowering
mass
of
rags
and
squalid
poverty
,
against
which
theindignation
of
the
rabble
of
Lambeth
seemed
to
be
directed
.
<EOS>
Ada
watched
the
scene
with
a
pitying
eye
;
she
could
not
imagine
anycircumstances
which
could
justify
the
hunting
down
of
a
fellow
-
creaturein
such
a
manner
;
but
Ada
did
not
know
enough
of
human
nature
to
beaware
that
one
of
its
recreations
is
persecution
in
all
forms
andshapes
.
<EOS>
Now
she
the
fugitive
took
to
the
fields
,
and
,
to
her
surprise
,
madedirectly
for
the
Lone
House
.
<EOS>
Ada
’s
heart
beat
quick
with
the
idea
thatthe
mob
would
follow
,
and
her
promise
to
Jacob
Gray
would
becomenugatory
by
persons
discovering
her
,
and
forcing
her
from
herimprisonment
,
instead
of
she
herself
contriving
the
means
of
escape
.
<EOS>
Too
soon
,
however
,
was
this
hope
dissipated
,
for
the
yelling
rout
,
after
pursuing
the
fugitive
a
short
distance
further
,
gave
up
thesport
,
and
retired
with
shouts
and
execrations
from
the
pleasures
ofthe
chase
.
<EOS>
Still
Ada
saw
the
fugitive
rushing
wildly
onwards
,
and
from
thelooseness
and
ragged
plight
of
the
apparel
,
she
could
not
decidewhether
it
was
a
male
or
a
female
,
who
was
evidently
making
with
speedtowards
Forrest
’s
house
.
<EOS>
To
obtain
a
nearer
view
of
the
stranger
,
Ada
descended
to
the
lowerportion
of
the
house
,
and
,
by
the
time
she
had
reached
a
window
on
theground
floor
,
the
persecuted
one
was
so
close
to
the
building
that
she
,
with
a
cry
of
surprise
,
recognised
her
as
the
mad
female
she
had
met
onWestminster
bridge
,
and
whose
features
and
general
appearance
theextraordinary
events
of
that
night
had
evidently
impressed
on
hermemory
.
<EOS>
For
several
moments
after
making
this
discovery
,
Ada
’s
mind
was
in
sucha
whirl
of
conflicting
emotions
,
that
she
could
decide
upon
noparticular
course
of
action
;
and
it
was
not
until
the
poor
hunted
,
bruised
,
and
<EOS>
bleeding
woman
had
sunk
upon
the
door
-
step
with
a
deepgroan
of
anguish
,
that
Ada
felt
herself
at
once
roused
to
exertion
,
anddetermined
to
dare
all
,
risk
all
,
in
the
sacred
cause
of
humanity
.
<EOS>
In
another
moment
the
compassionate
and
warm
-
hearted
Ada
was
at
thedoor
.
<EOS>
She
hesitated
not
a
moment
;
but
flinging
it
open
,
stood
,
for
thefirst
time
for
many
weary
months
,
from
under
that
miserableprison
-
house
.
<EOS>
The
sound
of
the
opening
of
the
door
seemed
at
once
to
strike
alarminto
the
heart
of
the
poor
creature
,
who
sat
crouched
upon
the
stepsand
sobbing
bitterly
.
<EOS>
She
sprang
to
her
feet
,
and
then
,
as
if
shelacked
the
strength
to
fly
,
she
sunk
upon
her
knees
,
and
in
low
,
heart
-
broken
accents
,
she
cried,—“Mercy
—
mercy
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
spare
me
!
<EOS>
Mercy
—
mercy!”It
is
impossible
to
describe
the
tone
of
exquisite
anguish
in
whichthese
words
were
spoken
;
but
Ada
felt
them
keenly
,
and
the
tears
rushedto
her
eyes
,
and
her
voice
faltered
as
she
said,—“I
<EOS>
am
myself
a
child
of
woe
and
persecution
.
<EOS>
Come
in
,
for
some
fewhours
yet
you
will
be
safe
here
.
<EOS>
”With
<EOS>
a
shriek
the
poor
maniac
threw
herself
at
Ada
’s
feet
,
andattempted
to
kiss
them
.
<EOS>
“How
<EOS>
I
love
to
hear
a
word
of
kindness
!
<EOS>
Is
there
a
human
heart
can
feelfor
poor
Mad
Maud!—Is
there
a
human
voice
can
speak
to
me
in
tones
<EOS>
ofpity?”“There
is

said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“
God
knows
I
pity
you
;
but
you

<EOS>
”“Hush

hush

”
<EOS>
said
Maud
,
holding
up
her
finger
and
smiling
.
<EOS>
“
Do
notspeak
—
you
are
young

beautiful

but
do
not
speak

I
heard
justnow

the
voice
of
one
of
God

ministering
angels

<EOS>
The
tone
was
low
andsweet
;
but
I
knew
it
—
<EOS>
Ha

<EOS>
I
knew
it—’tis
comfort
to
poor
Maud

<EOS>
”“’Twas

said
Ada

<EOS>
“Hark

There

<EOS>
Is

<EOS>
you?”“It

”“Shall

you
stay
long?”“Stay
where?”“From
your

<EOS>
”She
<EOS>
pointed
to
the
blue
sky
as
she
spoke
,
and
gazed
earnestly
upwards
.
<EOS>
“See
<EOS>
—
see
—
yon
cloud
is
waiting
for

she
said
suddenly

<EOS>
“
So

I

<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
poor
creature
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
,
and
wept
aloud
inher
fulness
of
heart
.
<EOS>
Ada
gently
laid
her
small
hand
upon
Maud
’s
arm
,
and
led
herunresistingly
into
the
house
,
closing
the
door
after
her
.
<EOS>
“Do
not
weep

she
said

<EOS>
withdrew
her
hands
from

and
gazed
earnestly
atAda

<EOS>
“Are

”Ada
<EOS>
placed
before

half

famished
being
such
food
as
she
had
inthe
house

and
,
while
she
ate
of
the
meat

bread
voraciously
,
Adaamused
herself
with
conjecture
as
to
who
and
what
this
singularcreature
could
be

who
seemed
,
in
some
strange
and
confused
manner

mixed
up

“Your

<EOS>
remarked
Ada

kindly

<EOS>
“Mad

call

was
the
reply—“but

Do

”“Alas

thought
Ada
,
“
it
is
in
vain
to
question
this
poor
creature

herwits

tangled

she
may

said
Ada

<EOS>
“And

continued
Maud

unheedful
of
the

No

was
a
wild
insane
exultation
about
the
poor

as
sheuttered
these
words

that
almost
alarmed
Ada

<EOS>
“The

she

”“They

the
Almighty
has
doomed
that

die
first

didyou
ever
see
that
child
again?”“What
child
?
”
<EOS>
said
Ada
,
earnestly
.
<EOS>
“
Of
what
do
you
speak?”“Ha
!
<EOS>
Ha!—’Twas
<EOS>
brave
work
!
<EOS>
Brave
work
!
“
muttered
Maud
.
<EOS>
“
Was
not
that
anawful
death
,
eh
?
<EOS>
It
came
from
the
Smithy
,
but
they
could
not
burn
thebody

<EOS>
No

no,—God

<EOS>
How
the
man
screamed
—
he
was
torn
and
bleeding
—
hisshrieks
were
music
to
me
—
music
!
<EOS>
Music
!
<EOS>
To
me
,
because
I
knew
he
was
amurderer

<EOS>
And
Andrew
Britton
was
plunged
deeper
,
deeper
in
crime
!
<EOS>
So
Ifollow
him
—
I
must
see
the
smith
die
—
that
is
my
task
for
life!”“Poor
creature
!
”
<EOS>
sighed
Ada
.
<EOS>
“Who
<EOS>
’s
that
,
”
cried
Maud
,
“
who
pities
me?”“I
do
,
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart

said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“
Oh
!
Tell
me
,
if
youcan

what
has
driven
you
to
this
state

this
fearful
state

<EOS>
Had
you

Tell

<EOS>
”Maud
<EOS>
convulsively
clutched
the
arms
of
the
chair
upon
which
she
sat
,
and
she
trembled
violently
as
Ada
spoke
—
once
,
twice
,
thrice
<EOS>
,
she
triedto
speak
,
then
with
a
violent
effort
she
gasped
the
words,—“House
—
kindred
—
love
—
<EOS>
oh
,
Heaven
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
Heaven
,
spare
me

<EOS>
spare
me!”She
then
burst
into
such
a
violent
and
frantic
fit
of
weeping
,
that
Adabecame
much
alarmed
,
and
entreated
her
to
be
composed
,
in
the
mostmoving
and
tender
accents
.
<EOS>
Gradually
the
deep
anguish
of
Maud
subsided
,
and
when
she
again
lookedon
the
face
of
Ada
,
the
wild
glowing
expression
of
her
eyes
had
givenplace
to
a
mild
lustre
,
and
she
said
in
a
low
soft
voice
,
exceedinglydifferent
from
that
in
which
she
usually
spoke,—“Where
am
I?”“Alas
!
”
<EOS>
said
Ada
,
“
I
can
scarcely
tell
you

but
till
sunset
you
arewelcome
to
what
shelter

food
I
can
give

<EOS>
”“Give

said
Maud
;
<EOS>
“
God

mercy
has
granted
me
just
now

”Maud
<EOS>
shook
her

deeply

<EOS>
“You
wish
me
to
go
at
sunset?”“For

”“Can

Maud

“

many

”She
<EOS>
compressed
her
head
tightly
for
several
seconds
,

rocked
to

as

<EOS>
—
then
suddenly
she
laid
her
long

”CHAPTER

XXX.The
Tale.—A
Blighted
Heart
’s
Despair
.
<EOS>
Poor
Maud
spoke
in
a
low
earnest
voice
,
and
Ada
became
deeplyinterested
in
her
story
,
as
with
many
tears
she
poured
it
into
the
earsof
the
lovely
and
persecuted
girl
.
<EOS>
“You
are
young
and
very
beautiful
,
”
she
commenced
.
<EOS>
“
I
was
young
,
andthey
told
me
I
was
beautiful
.
<EOS>
Look
at
me
now
,
and
smile
at
the
idleboast
.
<EOS>
Still
there
was
one
who
loved
me
—
one
who
listened
to
my
voice
,
as
though
it
had
a
magic
in
it
—
one
who
followed
me
where
I
led
.
<EOS>
Myheart
was
touched
by
the
purity
of
his
devotion
,
and
I
loved
him
evenas
he
loved
me
,
next
thing
to
Heaven
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
that
we
each
made
toomuch
of
our
earthly
idols
,
and
so
turned
the
face
of
Heaven
against
usboth
;
but
I
scarce
can
think
so
,
for
He
who
made
His
creatures
withfond
and
faithful
hearts
,
must
surely
look
with
pleasure
rather
thananger
upon
their
deep
and
holy
affections
.
<EOS>
Well
,
girl
,
the
future
laybefore
us
like
a
summer
’s
day
—
all
sunshine
,
joy
,
and
delight
.
<EOS>
We
askedeach
other
what
could
mar
our
happiness
;
and
in
the
ecstasy
of
our
owndear
truthfulness
we
answered
,
‘
Nothing
.
<EOS>
’“Where
<EOS>
our
mutual
parents
lived
,
there
came
one
day
a
man
of
coarse
andruffianly
aspect
.
<EOS>
He
said
he
came
to
settle
in
the
place
,
and
seek
ahelpmate
among
the
village
maidens
.
<EOS>
None
welcomed
him
,
for
his
mannerwas
harsh
and
brutal
—
an
index
of
the
mind
.
<EOS>
This
man
’s
name
was
AndrewBritton
.
”“Indeed
!
”
<EOS>
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“Yes
,
Andrew
Britton
,
a
smith
.
<EOS>
With
unparalleled
insolence
he
said
hehad
fixed
on
me
for
his
wife
.
<EOS>
I
scorned
his
suit
.
<EOS>
He
jested
at
myindignant
refusal
.
<EOS>
I
wept
,
for
we
were
alone
.
<EOS>
He
laughed
at
my
tears
.
<EOS>
Then
I
threatened
him
with
the
resentment
of
him
to
whom
I
had
alreadyplighted
my
young
heart
,
and
Andrew
Britton
swore
then
a
fearful
oaththat
<EOS>
I
never
should
be
his
.
<EOS>
“He
<EOS>
whom
I
loved
found
me
in
tears
,
and
after
much
solicitation
,
gotfrom
me
the
particulars
of
the
interview
that
had
just
terminated
withthe
Savage
Smith
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
tell
him
,
though
,
until
he
had
promisedme
<EOS>
he
would
not
endanger
himself
by
resenting
—
men
heed
not
suchpromises
.
<EOS>
His
young
blood
boiled
with
anger
.
<EOS>
He
met
the
smith
,
and
fromwords
they
came
to
mutual
violence
.
<EOS>
Britton
was
much
hurt
,
and
he
whomI
loved
came
off
the
conqueror
,
to
the
joy
of
all
.
<EOS>
“Britton
then
came
,
and
asked
my
forgiveness
.
<EOS>
He
said
he
was
an
alteredman
.
<EOS>
He
swore
he
repented
of
his
passion
,
and
we
believed
him
.
<EOS>
But
,
oh
,
girl
!
<EOS>
When
a
bad
,
wicked
man
speaks
,
you
may
fairly
mistrust
him

Tisthe
glitter
of
the
eyes
of
the
serpent
that
fascinate

to
betray

<EOS>
“The
day
of
my
union
was
at
length
fixed
.
<EOS>
There
were
no
regrets
—
nogrief
—
all
was
happiness
.
<EOS>
We
wandered
hand
-
in
-
hand
the
evening
before
tolook
at
<EOS>
the
last
sunset
ere
we
should
be
bound
together
in
those
holyties
which
none
dare
impiously
to
break
asunder

<EOS>
“We
wondered
what
could
happen
to
make
us
unhappy

<EOS>
We
saw
no
cloud
inthe
clear
horizon
of
our
joy

<EOS>
Oh

what
an
hour
of
bliss
was
that
!

we
looked

“The
sun
sunk
to
rest

and
in
the
east
uprose
the
silver
moon
ere
weparted
.
<EOS>
With
many
lingering
regrets
,
we
said
adieu
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
God
!
<EOS>
We
nevermet
again!”Maud
sunk
on
her
knees
,
and
,
hiding
her
face
upon
her
chair
,
she
againgave
way
to
a
similar
wild
,
awful
passion
of
grief
to
what
had
beforeaffected
her
.
<EOS>
Ada
had
been
deeply
impressed
with
poor
Maud
’s
simple
and
affectingnarrative
,
told
as
it
was
with
a
pathos
which
defies
description
.
<EOS>
Shedid
not
speak
but
let
the
woman
have
her
way
,
and
after
some
minutes
,
the
violence
of
her
grief
,
as
before
,
subsided
and
she
rose
to
outwardappearance
calm
again
.
<EOS>
“Bear
with
me
yet
<EOS>
a
brief
space
,
”
said
Maud
.
<EOS>
“
I
shall
not
weep
so
muchagain
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
hope
indeed
<EOS>
you
never
may
,
”
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“
But
it
would
be
a
harsh
andunfeeling
heart
that
could
not
bear
patiently
the
tears
springing
froma
bruised
heart
.
<EOS>
”Maud
<EOS>
took
Ada
’s
hand
,
and
pressed
it
to
her
lips
in
silent
gratitude
,
and
then
resumed
her
narrative
.
<EOS>
“The
morrow
came
,
and
brought
with
it
a
cloudless
sky
and
a
brightsunshine
,
which
never
to
me
seemed
so
bright
and
beautiful
.
<EOS>
We
were
tomeet
at
the
village
church
,
to
part
no
more
!
<EOS>
And
,
when
I
and
my
friendsarrived
,
and
we
found
that
we
were
first
,
they
were
inclined
to
chidemy
lover
’s
delay
,
but
I
only
smiled
,
for
no
doubt
crossed
my
mind
.
<EOS>
Notthe
smallest
speck
appeared
to
me
as
yet
in
the
heaven
of
my
happiness
.
<EOS>
“An
hour
passed
,
and
still
he
came
not
.
<EOS>
Then
,
indeed
,
there
was
aflutter
at
my
heart
—
a
mingled
feeling
of
alarm
and
anger
.
<EOS>
Then
somewent
to
seek
him
,
and
returned
unsuccessful
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
be
found
!
<EOS>
Myanger
vanished
,
and
I
began
to
tremble
.
<EOS>
Two
more
hours
passed
away
—
thelast
was
one
of
agony
.
<EOS>
“Then
came
one
into
the
church
,
and
whispered
to
my
father
.
<EOS>
I
saw
hischeek
grow
pale
!
<EOS>
I
saw
him
clutch
at
the
altar
rail
for
support
!
<EOS>
Atthat
moment
,
I
thought
I
should
have
died
,
for
I
knew
that
somethinghad
been
whispered
which
was
too
horrible
to
speak
aloud
.
<EOS>
“By
<EOS>
a
violent
effort
<EOS>
,
I
preserved
myself
from
fainting
,
and
rushed
tomy
father
.
<EOS>
“‘Tell
<EOS>
me
—
tell
!
’
<EOS>
I
shrieked
.
<EOS>
‘
What
has
happened
?
<EOS>
Father
,
suspense
willkill
me
.
<EOS>
’“‘He
is
dead
!
’
<EOS>
was
the
reply
.
<EOS>
“I
heard
no
more
—
I
saw
no
more
!
<EOS>
For
many
months
they
told
me
I
lay
abreathing
senseless
form
,
and
then
I
awakened
,
and
my
first
words
were,‘Take
me
to
him!’“They
told
me
then
that
the
grave
had
long
since
received
its
tenant
,
and
by
degrees
I
learned
from
them
that
my
lover
—
my
husband
in
thesight
of
Heaven
,
had
been
found
a
mangled
corpse
at
the
foot
of
a
deepprecipice
.
<EOS>
“He
must
have
fallen
over
,
they
told
me
,
but
I
knew
better
;
somethingwhispered
to
me
that
Andrew
Britton
did
the
deed
.
<EOS>
“Since
<EOS>
then
I
know
not
what
has
happened
.
<EOS>
Once
I
awoke
and
found
myselfchained
to
a
stone
wall
in
a
gloomy
cell
;
then
again
I
was
thrust
outfrom
somewhere
,
and
a
voice
told
me
to
be
gone
,
for
I
was
harmless
.
<EOS>
SoI
became
Mad
Maud
as
I
am
,
and
I
follow
Britton
the
Savage
Smith
,
because
he
is
to
die
before
I
do
,
and
then
I
shall
meet
my
loveragain
—
and
do
you
know
that
some
sunset
,
by
the
great
bounty
of
Heaven
,
he
will
come
again
—
when
the
murder
is
found
out
;
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
,
when
themurder
is
found
out
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
Ha!”Again
<EOS>
the
maniac
’s
eye
glanced
with
the
wild
fire
of
insanity
,
and
poorMaud
was
lost
once
more
in
the
wanderings
of
her
imagination
.
<EOS>
The
sympathies
of
Ada
had
been
so
strongly
excited
by
the
narrative
ofpoor
Maud
that
she
had
allowed
the
lucid
interval
of
the
poor
maniac
topass
away
without
questioning
on
the
subjects
nearest
and
dearest
toher
.
<EOS>
With
a
hope
that
even
yet
it
might
not
be
too
late
to
glean
someinformation
from
her
,
she
<EOS>
said,—“What
murder
<EOS>
do
you
mean?”“The
murder
at
the
Old
Smithy
,
”
replied
Maud
.
<EOS>
“
You
saw
the
man
as
wellI
—
we
all
saw
him
.
<EOS>
”“When
<EOS>
was
that
?
”
<EOS>
asked
Ada
.
<EOS>
“Last
night
!
<EOS>
Last
night
!
<EOS>
Hark
,
the
wind
is
still
around
the
Old
Smithy
.
<EOS>
”“’Tis
<EOS>
all
in
vain
,
”
sighed
Ada
.
<EOS>
“
The
time
is
past
.
”It
<EOS>
now
suddenly
struck
Ada
that
there
would
be
extreme
danger
to
thepoor
creature
<EOS>
should
she
stay
till
Jacob
Gray
came
home
;
and
<EOS>
as
the
sunwas
just
dipping
into
the
western
horizon
,
she
said
to
her,—“Take
with
you
all
these
victuals,—I
have
no
power
here
to
prolong
yourwelcome
.
<EOS>
”“The
child
of
the
dead
!
<EOS>
The
child
of
the
dead
!
”
<EOS>
muttered
Maud
,
totallyunheeding
what
Ada
said
.
<EOS>
“Let
me
now
entreat
you
to
go
,
”
said
the
alarmed
girl
.
<EOS>
“
There
will
beone
here
by
sunset
who
has
no
feeling
,
no
mercy
.
<EOS>
”“That
must
be
Britton
,
the
Savage
Smith
,
”
cried
Maud
.
<EOS>
“No
,
’
tis
one
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
Heard
you
ever
that
name
before?”“Jacob
Gray
!
”
<EOS>
repeated
Maud
,
evidently
with
no
sort
of
recognition
ofthe
name
.
<EOS>
“
I
will
sing
to
him
and
you
.
<EOS>
”“Go
<EOS>
;
let
me
entreat
you
to
go
,
”
cried
Ada
.
<EOS>
Maud
heeded
her
not
,
but
began
to
sing
in
a
wild
but
sweet
voice,—“Who
loves
the
bleak
night
wind
,
That
roars
’
twist
earth
and
sky
,
Say
,
is
its
loud

kind?Not

cheerless

”As
<EOS>
the
last
sound
of
the
poor
creature
’s
voice
ceased
,
Ada
clasped
herhands
and
uttered
a
cry
of
terror
,
for
she
heard
without
the
lowwhistle
which
she
had
been
taught
by
Gray
to
recognise
as
the
signal
ofhis

CHAPTER
XXXI.The
Interview.—Jacob
Gray
’s
Meditations.—The
Slip
of
Paper.—TheNail.—The
Guilty
Conscience.—The
Departure
.
<EOS>
For
perhaps
the
space
of
a
minute
,
Ada
lost
the
power
of
action
;
butthe
stern
necessity
of
doing
something
to
save
the
poor
creature
fromthe
death
<EOS>
which
Jacob
Gray
’s
fears
<EOS>
would
,
she
doubted
not
,
induce
himto
<EOS>
put
her
to
,
braced
the
nerves
of
the
young
girl
.
<EOS>
She
took
Maud
by
the
arm
,
and
looking
her
earnestly
in
the
face
,
<EOS>
shesaid,—“What
was
the
name
of
him
<EOS>
you
loved?”Maud
pressed
her
hand
upon
her
brow
for
a
moment
as
if
striving
tocomprehend
the
question
;
then
she
replied,—“His
name
was
William
Heriot
.
<EOS>
”“Then
follow
me
,
and
speak
not
for
his
sake
,
as
you
hold
his
memorydear
.
”“To
<EOS>
the
world
’s
end
!
<EOS>
To
the
world
’s
end
!
”
said
Maud
.
<EOS>
Ada
heard
the
outer
door
now
close
,
and
she
was
sure
that
Gray
was
inthe
passage
.
<EOS>
He
might
,
or
he
might
not
,
enter
the
room
in
which
she
andMaud
were
,
the
door
of
which
was
within
a
few
paces
of
the
steps
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
how
dreadful
to
poor
Ada
were
the
few
short
,
but
to
her
awful
momentsthat
elapsed
before
she
felt
convinced
that
Gray
had
passed
the
door
,
he
always
trod
slowly
and
stealthily
even
in
that
lone
house
,
forcaution
and
suspicion
had
grown
so
habitual
with
him
,
that
even
insecurity
he
could
not
shake
off
the
actions
which
rendered
thosefeelings
manifest
.
<EOS>
It
was
difficult
,
therefore
,
for
Ada
to
trace
his
footsteps
,
or
come
toany
positive
conclusion
as
to
what
part
of
the
house
he
had
proceededtowards
.
<EOS>
One
thing
only
she
could
feel
certain
of
from
the
duration
of
time
,
andthat
was
,
that
the
immediate
danger
of
his
entering
the
room
in
whichshe
<EOS>
and
Maud
were
was
past
,
unless
he
were
lingering
in
the
passage
,
which
she
had
never
yet
known
him
to
do
.
<EOS>
A
few
more
minutes
of
great
anxiety
now
passed
,
during
which
Maud
didnot
speak
,
but
rocked
to
and
fro
in
her
chair
,
sighing
deeply
,
as
ifthe
sound
of
her
murdered
lover
’s
name
had
affected
her
deeply
.
<EOS>
“Maud
,
”
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“
Maud
,
attend
to
me
.
<EOS>
”“I
hear
the
voice
,
”
said
Maud
,
“
the
voice
of
the
angel
that
has
comefrom
Heaven
to
speak
words
of
kindness
to
poor
Mad
Maud
.
<EOS>
”“By
<EOS>
the
memory
of
William
Heriot
,
”
said
Ada
,
“
do
not
speak
or
move
tillI
come
to
you
again
.
<EOS>
”Ada
<EOS>
then
left
the
room
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
in
what
roomJacob
Gray
was
staying
.
<EOS>
With
an
assumed
carelessness
of
step
and
mannershe
walked
into
the
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
,
but
in
none
of
them
wasJacob
Gray
;
she
then
ascended
the
staircase
,
and
as
she
neared
the
topof
the
crazy
flight
,
a
door
was
suddenly
opened
upon
the
landing
,
<EOS>
andGray
appeared
.
<EOS>
Ada
paused
,
and
they
regarded
each
other
for
a
few
moments
in
silence
.
<EOS>
Then
Gray
said
,
in
a
low
tone,—“Nothing
has
happened
,
Ada
?
<EOS>
No
alarm?”“No
alarm
,
”
said
Ada
,
answering
his
last
question
;
“
wait
for
me
below
,
we
must
have
some
talk
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
”“To
<EOS>
-
day?”“Yes
,
I
promise
but
from
month
to
month
—
to
-
day
the
month
expires
,
”
saidAda
.
<EOS>
“It
does
,
but
the
promise
will
be
renewed
.
<EOS>
”“Stay
where
you
are
,
”
said
Ada
,
“
I
will
come
to
you
in
a
short
time
.
<EOS>
”“Nay
,
not
here
,
”
said
Gray
,
“
go
to
the
room
below
.
<EOS>
I
will
be
with
youshortly
.
<EOS>
”“I
am
even
now
proceeding
to
my
own
chamber
,
”
said
Ada
;
“
in
a
quarterof
an
hour
I
will
meet
you
here
.
<EOS>
”Without
<EOS>
waiting
for
a
reply
,
Ada
ascended
to
her
own
room
.
<EOS>
Gray
stood
for
a
minute
with
the
door
in
his
hand
,
muttering
tohimself,—“She
braves
me
thus
ever
—
if
I
were
to
remark
that
the
sun
shone
<EOS>
,
shewould
declare
’
twas
very
cold
—
<EOS>
sometimes
I
doubt
if
I
hate
her
orLearmont
most
;
yet
I
must
spare
her
to
be
revenged
on
him
!
<EOS>
Curses
onthem
all!”He
<EOS>
flung
the
door
to
,
which
shut
with
a
bang
that
Ada
heard
withthankfulness
.
<EOS>
Gray
then
unlocked
a
cupboard
in
the
room
,
and
proceededto
deposit
,
in
a
sacred
place
he
had
constructed
at
the
back
of
it
,
thelast
sum
of
money
he
had
wrung
from
the
fears
of
Learmont
.
<EOS>
In
the
same
place
of
safety
,
likewise
,
was
the
written
confessionaddressed
to
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
but
that
was
not
concealed
;
it
layopenly
in
the
cupboard
,
a
prominent
object
to
any
one
who
should
forcethe
door
.
<EOS>
A
smile
of
self
-
satisfaction
came
across
Jacob
Gray
’s
<EOS>
face
ashe
took
the
paper
in
his
hand
,
and
fixed
his
keen
eyes
upon
itssuperscription
to
the
magistrate
.
<EOS>
“It
<EOS>
would
,
indeed
,
be
a
glorious
revenge
,
”
he
mattered
,
“
on
bothBritton
and
Learmont
to
accumulate
an
ample
fortune
first
,
and
then
,
when
my
foot
was
on
the
very
deck
of
the
vessel
that
was
to
bear
mefrom
England
for
ever
,
to
hail
some
idle
lounger
on
the
quay
,
and
bidhim
take
this
to
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
and
ask
his
own
reward
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
ifI
had
half
a
million
,
that
would
be
worth
as
much
again
.
<EOS>
The
time
willcome
—
<EOS>
yes
—
it
will
—
it
must
come
—
when
I
have
got
enough
money
first
,
andthen
my
revenge
.
<EOS>
Ye
taunt
me
,
Squire
Learmont
,
and
you
,
Britton
,
too
,
with
my
cunning
—
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
I
am
cunning
,
it
is
true
—
<EOS>
I
am
too
cunning
foryour
dull
wits
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
will
be
too
much
for
you
both
when
he
hasenough
money!”Suddenly
then
he
now
dropped
the
paper
,
and
started
;
a
slight
noiseoutside
his
door
met
his
ears
,
and
his
guilty
soul
trembled
.
<EOS>
“What
—
what
noise
was
that
?
”
<EOS>
he
whispered
.
<EOS>
“
Ada
—
yes
—
Ada,—Ah
!
<EOS>
It
must
beAda!”In
order
to
explain
the
sound
that
disturbed
the
gleeful
cogitations
ofJacob
Gray
,
we
must
follow
Ada
to
her
chamber
,
whither
,
as
the
readerwill
recollect
<EOS>
,
she
repaired
after
her
very
brief
conversation
with
hergaoler
Gray
.
<EOS>
The
moment
Ada
found
herself
in
the
privacy
of
her
own
room
<EOS>
she
burstinto
tears
,
and
a
fervent
“
thank
Heaven
!
”
<EOS>
burst
from
her
lips
.
<EOS>
The
necessity
of
instant
action
and
self
-
possession
,
however
,
rushedsimultaneously
across
her
mind
,
and
dashing
away
the
tears
with
thebrief
exclamation
of,—“My
promise
no
longer
binds
me
—
I
am
free
to
act
,
”
she
hastily
wrote
ona
slip
of
paper
,
the
following
words:—“To
Albert
Seyton,—Ada
is
betrayed
—
seek
her
in
a
Lone
House
by
theriver
.
<EOS>
”She
<EOS>
then
concealed
the
paper
in
her
bosom
,
and
,
commending
herself
toHeaven
,
with
a
beating
heart
she
descended
the
staircase
.
<EOS>
Her
object
now
was
to
pass
the
door
of
the
room
in
which
was
Gray
,
without
arousing
his
attention
;
but
this
was
a
matter
of
no
ordinarydifficulty
in
that
old
house
,
for
the
staircase
was
so
ancient
anddilapidated
that
it
creaked
and
groaned
under
the
slightest
pressure
.
<EOS>
Taking
,
however
,
as
much
of
her
weight
off
the
stairs
as
possible
,
byclinging
to
a
stout
rail
,
which
was
supported
firmly
by
the
wall
,
Adaslowly
descended
.
<EOS>
She
reached
the
landing
,
from
which
opened
the
door
of
the
room
inwhich
was
Gray
,
in
safety
.
<EOS>
To
pass
that
door
was
dreadful
,
and
Adathought
each
moment
that
her
strength
would
desert
her
,
and
all
wouldbe
discovered
.
<EOS>
The
life
of
poor
Maud
,
she
felt
certain
,
hung
upon
theslightest
thread
,
and
this
thought
nerved
Ada
more
than
anyconsciousness
of
personal
danger
would
have
done
.
<EOS>
Creeping
cautiously
along
,
she
reached
the
door
—
one
moment
,
then
shepaused
,
and
the
sound
of
Jacob
Gray
’s
voice
,
as
he
muttered
his
unholythoughts
came
clearly
upon
her
overstrained
senses
.
<EOS>
With
her
hands
pressing
upon
her
heart
to
still
its
wild
tumultuousbeating
,
she
passed
the
door
;
now
the
flight
of
stairs
leading
to
thehouse
was
gained
in
safety
.
<EOS>
She
laid
her
trembling
hands
upon
thebanisters
,
and
at
that
moment
it
was
that
Gray
heard
the
creaking
soundthat
alarmed
him
in
the
midst
of
his
wicked
rejoicing
over
thetreachery
he
meditated
.
<EOS>
Ada
turned
slowly
round
,
and
faced
the
door
.
<EOS>
To
fly
she
knew
wouldtempt
pursuit
;
and
without
,
in
her
confusion
,
being
able
to
reflectfurther
than
that
,
the
best
plan
would
be
to
face
Jacob
Gray
<EOS>
should
hecome
from
the
room
,
Ada
stood
for
several
minutes
enduring
the
mosttorturing
and
agonising
suspense
.
<EOS>
All
remained
still
;
Gray
did
not
appear
,
and
once
more
Ada
turned
todescend
the
staircase
;
one
step
she
had
taken
downwards
,
when
a
loosenail
from
the
crazy
banisters
fell
into
the
passage
below
,
making
,
inthe
solemn
silence
that
reigned
in
the
house
,
an
alarming
noise
.
<EOS>
Ada
paused
.
<EOS>
“Now
,
now
,
”
she
thought
,
“
I
shall
need
all
my
firmness
.
<EOS>
Heaven
help
menow!”The
door
of
Gray
’s
room
opened
,
and
he
stood
in
the
entrance
with
apale
and
anxious
face
:
<EOS>
Ada
turned
as
before
,
and
met
his
gaze
.
<EOS>
It
wouldhave
been
difficult
that
moment
to
have
decided
which
face
<EOS>
bore
thepalest
hue
—
the
beautiful
and
innocent
one
of
Ada
,
contrasted
as
it
waswith
,
her
long
jetty
ringlets
,
to
the
disturbed
,
haggard
countenance
ofthe
man
of
crimes
and
blood
.
<EOS>
“There
—
there
was
—
a
noise
!
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“I
heard
it
,
”
replied
Ada
.
<EOS>
“W
—
where
was
it?”“Above
.
<EOS>
”“’Twas
<EOS>
nothing
,
Ada
—
nothing
—
I
suppose
quite
accidental
,
Ada
;
you
aregoing
down
—
<EOS>
I
—
<EOS>
I’ll
follow
you
—
<EOS>
I’ll
follow
you
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
closed
the
door
behind
him
with
a
trembling
hand
,
and
made
a
steptowards
the
staircase
.
<EOS>
“Jacob
Gray
,
”
cried
Ada
,
“
stop
.
”He
<EOS>
paused
,
for
there
was
an
awful
earnestness
in
her
manner
thatgreatly
added
to
his
alarm
.
<EOS>
Yet
Ada
knew
not
what
to
do
or
how
to
act
.
<EOS>
The
words
she
uttered
were
almost
involuntary
.
<EOS>
Then
it
might
be
thatHeaven
whispered
to
her
mind
a
course
of
action
;
but
it
came
across
hermind
that
Gray
might
be
alarmed
still
more
,
knowing
the
lurkingsuperstition
of
his
character
,
and
she
suddenly
said,—“Did
you
not
tell
me
once
this
house
was
haunted?”“Haunted
!
”
<EOS>
echoed
Gray
,
suddenly
descending
several
stairs
,
and
showingby
his
rapid
changes
of
colour
the
craven
fear
that
was
at
his
heart’sinmost
core
.
<EOS>
His
fears
,
however
,
had
prompted
him
to
the
very
course
which
Ada
somuch
dreaded
,
namely
,
to
descend
to
the
lower
part
of
the
house
,
and
onthe
impulse
of
the
moment
she
laid
her
hand
on
Jacob
Gray
’s
arm
,
andsaid,—“I
<EOS>
was
following
it
<EOS>
—
it
has
gone
<EOS>
down!”“It!—Who?—What
?
”
<EOS>
cried
Gray
,
as
he
sprung
back
again
to
the
door
of
hisroom
in
an
instant
,
trembling
exceedingly
.
<EOS>
Ada
’s
pure
and
innocent
heart
detested
all
kinds
of
duplicity
;
but
ifever
<EOS>
such
was
justifiable
<EOS>
,
it
was
surely
then
;
and
to
save
the
life
ofthe
poor
creature
who
had
sought
shelter
with
her
,
and
had
suffered
somuch
wrong
and
unmerited
persecution
,
was
a
justification
which
,
withthe
rapidity
of
thought
,
came
to
Ada
’s
relief
.
<EOS>
“There
is
some
one
below
,
”
she
said
.
<EOS>
“You
—
you
saw
—
it?”“I
did
.
<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
—
and
—
followed
it?”Gray
licked
his
parched
lips
,
as
after
a
pause
he
added.—“Ada
—
<EOS>
a
—
what
manner
of
appearance
was
it?”“Will
you
follow
it
with
me?”“Not
for
worlds
—
not
for
worlds
,
”
cried
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
Tell
me
,
Ada
,
was
—
was
—
wasit
a
man
of
—
tall
stature
.
”“It
<EOS>
was
,
”
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“Of
—
of
noble
bearing
<EOS>
—
hair
—
slightly
silvered?”“Even
<EOS>
so
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
thought—’twas
<EOS>
he
.
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
—
I

him
once
at
the
door
—
in
that

<EOS>
Yes

that
has
begun

<EOS>
I
—
shall
be
haunted
now
—
for
ever
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
horror
!
<EOS>
Horror!”The
word
“
smithy
”
struck
upon
Ada
’s
ears
,
and
for
one
moment
she
couldnot
recollect
why
it
came
as
if
it
were
an
old
recollection
to
her
.
<EOS>
Then
she
remembered
that
Mad
Maud
had
spoken
of
a
murder
at
an
OldSmithy
,
and
she
asked
herself
,
can
there
be
any
connection
between
allthese
dark
hints
of
things
long
past
and
my
own
fate
?
<EOS>
There
must
be
—
<EOS>
Iwill
probe
your
heart
,
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
“I
will
tell
you
,
”
she
said
,
turning
suddenly
to
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
Listen
!
<EOS>
A
wildbleeding
form
has
appeared
in
this
house
.
”“Bleeding
?
”
<EOS>
gasped
Gray
.
<EOS>
“Yes
,
bleeding
.
<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
—
and
—
it
is
—
”
<EOS>
Gray
pointed
down
the
staircase
.
<EOS>
“It
is
there
,
”
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
Gray
shuddered
,
as
he
said,—“Can
you
—
<EOS>
look
on
it
,
and
live?”“I
<EOS>
can
.
<EOS>
”“God
help
me!”“Come
with
me
,
and
we
will
together
question
it
further
,
”
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“No
!
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
No
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
The
sight
would
blast
me
forever

<EOS>
Ada

<EOS>
Ada!If
<EOS>
you
have
one
spark
of
pity
,
one
yearning
of
heavenly
mercy
in
yourheart

you
will
pray
for

me

<EOS>
pray
for
me!”“For
you
—
my
persecutor?”“Implore
that
hideous
form
to
visit
here
no
more
.
<EOS>
I
shall
gomad!—Mad!—Mad!”Gray
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
,
and
groaned
bitterly
.
<EOS>
“In
<EOS>
his
anguish
he
may
confess
all
,
”
thought
Ada
,
and
hastily
callingto
her
memory
the
words
spoken
by
Maud
<EOS>
,
she
said
in
a
solemn
whisper,—“Jacob
Gray
,
the
bleeding
form
that
has
visited
is
not
terrible
to
me
.
<EOS>
”“No
<EOS>
,
no

”
said
Gray
,
“
because—”“Because
what?”“Nothing
—
nothing
<EOS>
—
I
have
said
nothing

<EOS>
”“Then
<EOS>
hear
me
,
”
added
Ada
.
<EOS>
“
Strange
things
have
been
spoken
to
me
.
<EOS>
”“By
<EOS>
—
it?”“Yes
.
<EOS>
Do
you
recollect
an
Old
Smithy?”Gray
removed
his
hands
from
before
his
face
,
and
sinking
on
his
knees
,
he
crawled
towards
Ada
.
<EOS>
“Mercy
!
<EOS>
Mercy
!
”
<EOS>
he
said
,
in
a
husky
whisper
.
<EOS>
“There
was
a
murder
,
”
continued
Ada
.
<EOS>
“Ada
!
<EOS>
Ada

”
<EOS>
shrieked
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
Child
of
the
dead
,
spare
me
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
spare
me!”“Child
of
the
dead

<EOS>
cried
Ada
.
<EOS>
“
Speak

towards

“And

The

’s
object
was
more
than
accomplished
.
<EOS>
“Wait
for
me
,
”
she
cried
,
and
glided
down
the
staircase
,
leaving
Graycrouched
up
by
the
door
of
the
room
,
with
his
glowing
eyes
fixed
uponthe
staircase
,
in
awful
expectation
of
seeing
each
moment
a
dreadfulform
,
that
would
drive
him
to
insanity
by
one
look
from
its
glazed
eye
.
<EOS>
The
period
of
trembling
and
nervousness
was
now
passed
with
Ada
,
andwith
the
lightness
and
speed
of
a
young
fawn
,
she
bounded
into
the
roomwhere
sat
poor
Maud
.
<EOS>
The
poor
creature
’s
eyes
brightened
as
Ada
approached
,
and
she
said,—“I
have
not
stirred
—
<EOS>
I
have
not
spoken

<EOS>
”“Hush

<EOS>
Hush

said
Ada

<EOS>
“
Speak

“Moments

Ada

Wherever

<EOS>
“
Oh

,
thrust
the
paper
into

allowed

to
be
led
byAda

the
door

<EOS>
“God

cried
the

kissed

bitterly

“Away

Ada

<EOS>
a
hunted
deer

<EOS>
Mad
Maud
flew
from
the
Lone
House

<EOS>
Ada
watched
herfor
a
few
minutes
across
the
swampy
waste
,
then
,
the
excitement
beingover
,
she
burst
into
a
passion
of
tears
,
and
dropped
into
a
state
ofhalf
insensibility
in
the
passage
of
the
old
house
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XXXII.Jacob
Gray
’s
Fears.—The
Promise.—Ada
’s
Meditations
.
<EOS>
How
long
she
remained
in
the
passage
of
the
house
,
Ada
had
no
means
ofdistinctly
knowing
,
but
,
when
she
recovered
from
her
insensibility
,
shefound
herself
in
the
parlour
alone
,
and
nearly
in
total
darkness
.
<EOS>
A
few
moments
sufficed
to
bring
to
her
recollection
all
that
hadoccurred
,
and
she
sprang
to
her
feet
,
looking
anxiously
around
her
,
aswell
as
the
dim
light
would
permit
,
to
see
if
Jacob
Gray
was
in
theroom
.
<EOS>
An
instant
inquiry
satisfied
her
that
she
was
alone
,
but
scarcely
hadshe
made
this
discovery
when
a
gleam
of
light
came
in
from
the
passage
,
and
the
door
was
gently
and
cautiously
pushed
open
.
<EOS>
Ada
did
not
speak
,
but
she
shrunk
into
a
corner
of
the
room
,
and
saw
Gray
enter
,
carryingwith
him
a
dim
light
.
<EOS>
“Ada
!
Ada
!
”
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
“I
am
here
,
”
she
replied
.
<EOS>
He
set
the
light
on
the
table
,
and
she
saw
that
his
face
looked
harshand
haggard
.
<EOS>
“We
can
not
stay
here
,
”
he
said
,
after
a
pause
.
<EOS>
“
This
place
will
behideous
now
.
<EOS>
”“Not
stay
here
!
<EOS>
“
cried
Ada
,
and
her
heart
sunk
within
her
at
thethought
of
being
again
removed
at
the
very
time
when
there
was
a
chanceof
her
being
rescued
by
Albert
Seyton
,
should
he
or
any
one
knowing
hisname
chance
to
see
the
paper
she
had
given
to
Mad
Maud
.
<EOS>
“No
—
<EOS>
no
,
”
added
Gray
,
“
I
—
I
would
not
sleep
here
.
<EOS>
The
very
air
of
thisplace
smells
of
the
grave
!
<EOS>
We
must
away
,
Ada!”“How
came
I
in
this
room
?
”
<EOS>
said
Ada!“After
a
long
time
when
you
returned
not
to
me
,
”
replied
Gray
,
“
Idescended
the
staircase
,
and
found
you
lying
in
the
passage
just
by
thedoor
which
you
had
evidently
been
trying
to
escape
by
.
<EOS>
”Ada
was
deeply
thankful
that
Jacob
Gray
himself
put
this
interpretationon
the
circumstance
of
finding
the
door
open
,
and
she
said,—“My
feelings
overcame
me
.
<EOS>
”“Ay
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
The
sight
must
have
been
terrible
!
”
<EOS>
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
Come
,
Ada;’tis
a
very
dark
night
—
attire
yourself
in
the
less
cumbrous
and
safergarments
of
a
boy
,
and
let
us
leave
here
.
<EOS>
”“You
forget
your
promise
,
”
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“My
promise
?
<EOS>
What
promise?”“You
said
you
would
tell
me
all
.
<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
so
will
I
at
the
proper
time
and
season
,
which
,
believe
me
,
willbe
the
sooner
for
what
has
chanced
this
night
.
<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
so
am
I
deceived
again
,
”
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“Girl
,
”
said
Gray
,
“
you
are
young
enough
yet
to
wait
a
short
time
.
<EOS>
There
will
come
a
day
when
justice
shall
be
done
you
,
and
the
cup
of
myrevenge
will
be
filled
to
the
overflowing
!
<EOS>
It
will
be
very
soon
,
Ada
.
<EOS>
”Ada
felt
that
to
urge
Gray
now
that
his
great
fear
had
passed
away
tofulfil
any
promise
he
might
have
made
while
under
its
influence
,
wouldbe
quite
futile
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
her
great
object
—
the
escape
of
poor
Maud
—
wasaccomplished
,
and
she
had
no
new
spectre
wherewith
to
frighten
JacobGray
.
<EOS>
“For
<EOS>
that
brief
time
you
speak
of
,
”
said
she
,
“
let
us
remain
here
.
<EOS>
Think
you
the
spirits
of
another
world
can
not
follow
you
wherever
yougo
,
Jacob
Gray?”“Follow
me
?
”
echoed
Gray
.
<EOS>
“Ay
;
are
not
all
places
alike
to
them
?
<EOS>
Why
remove
from
here?”Gray
seemed
to
remain
silent
,
then
he
said
in
a
low
agitated
voice,—“Girl
,
what
you
say
may
be
true
.
<EOS>
I
will
think
of
it
again

<EOS>
To

<EOS>
Yes

let
it
be
till
to

<EOS>
You
are
not
weary?”“Wherefore
do
you
ask
?
”
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“Because
,
”
faltered
Gray
,
“
<EOS>
I
do
not
wish
to
be
alone
.
<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
can
you
ask
me
to
save
you
from
the
horrors
of
that
solitude
whichyour
conscience
peoples
with
hideous
forms?”“Question
<EOS>
me
not
,
”
cried
Gray
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
“
I
—
I
would
have
desiredyour
company
—
but
will
not
enforce
it
.
<EOS>
”“You
can
not

”
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“Cannot
?
<EOS>
You
know
not
what
you
say
.
<EOS>
”“You
dare
not
!
”
<EOS>
added
Ada
.
<EOS>
She
had
learnt
by
experience
that
she
could
defy
Jacob
Gray
to
his
facesuccessfully
.
<EOS>
Her
only
fear
of
him
was
that
he
would
murder
her
whileshe
slept
or
mingle
poison
with
her
food
!
<EOS>
She
could
not
look
on
him
.
<EOS>
“Leave
me
,
then
!
<EOS>
Leave
me
if
you
will
,
”
he
said
.
<EOS>
“
I
will
not
invadeyour
chamber
.
<EOS>
”“If
<EOS>
you
were
,
”
said
Ada
,
“
you
might
perchance
be
frozen
with
horror
bymeeting
the
form
you
have
described
,
with
so
much
dread
—
a
form
whichthe
voice
of
nature
hints
must
be
that
of
my
murdered
father!”As
<EOS>
she
spoke
,
Ada
walked
to
the
door
of
the
room
,
but
ere
she
reachedit
,
Gray
called
to
her
.
<EOS>
“Ada
,
stay
yet
a
moment!”“You
forget!”“Forget
what?”“That
I
must
this
day
again
receive
your

exert
nocontrivance

your
escape

At
twelve
to

”“Oh

cried
Ada
.
<EOS>
“
Then
I
was
free?”“No

”
said
Gray
,
“
you
were
not
free

<EOS>
I
knew
that
if
you
meditatedescape
,
you
would
seize
the
first
moment

<EOS>
I
watched
this
house
fromtwelve
till
two

<EOS>
Then
as
you
came
not
forth
,
I
knew
I
was
safe

<EOS>
”“And
you
<EOS>
departed?”“I
did

<EOS>
”Had
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
watched
another
hour
he
would
have
seen
Maud
hunted
tothe
old
house
.
<EOS>
“Your
promise

girl
,
”
he
cried
.
<EOS>
“
Before
we
part
to
-
night
I
must
haveyour
solemn
<EOS>
promise!”“On
the
same
condition
,
”
said
Ada
,
“
to
preserve
that
life
which
God
hasgiven
me
,
I
will
give
you
my
promise

<EOS>
”“Be
<EOS>
it
<EOS>
so
,
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“Then
in
the
name
of
Heaven
,
I
promise
from

one
month
from

So

said
Gray
,
“
I
am
content

<EOS>
I
know
you
will
keep
your
word

<EOS>
”“How
is
it

”
said
Ada
,
“
that
you
can
trust
thus
to

<EOS>
you
not
taught

deceit

<EOS>
Were
I
to
deceive
you

you
blame
me?”“Question
<EOS>
me
not

cried
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
I
have
said
I
would
trust
to
your
word

<EOS>
Let
that
suffice

<EOS>
”Ada
turned
away
,
and
sought
the
solitude
of
her
own
room
.
<EOS>
She
alwayswept
bitterly
after
renewing
her
promise
to
Gray
—
it
seemed
like
pushinghope
to
a
further
distance
from
her
heart
,
and
on
this
occasion
,
whenshe
was
alone
,
the
tears
dimmed
her
eyes
as
she
reflected
anothermonth
—
another
month
!
<EOS>
But
then
even
upon
the
instant
,
a
small
stillvoice
within
her
heart
seemed
to
whisper
to
her
that
there
were
nowbetter
grounds
for
hope
than
ever
.
<EOS>
She
had
made
an
effort
by
the
slipof
paper
that
poor
Mad
Maud
had
taken
with
her
—
and
her
promise
to
Graywas
expressly
conditional
,
so
that
if
Albert
Seyton
should
seek
her
,
she
was
free
!
<EOS>
How
delightful
did
that
word
sound
to
the
desolate
heartof
the
young
girl
.
<EOS>
She
clasped
her
hands
,
and
a
smile
played
over
herface
like
a
sunbeam
on
a
lake
.
“Oh
!
”
<EOS>
she
cried
,
“
if
kind
Heaven
has
indeed
joy
in
store
for
the
poor
,
persecuted
Ada
,
surely
it
will
be
more
delightful
by
the
contrast
withwhat
has
passed

CHAPTER
XXXIII.Britton
at
the
Chequers.—The
Visit.—A
Mysterious
Stranger.—The
GoodCompany
.
<EOS>
Britton
,
the
smith
,
was
in
truth
a
great
man
at
the
Chequers
,
inWestminster
.
<EOS>
His
love
of
liquor
suited
the
landlord
amazingly
,
and
hiscustom
,
when
the
whim
took
him
,
of
treating
everybody
who
happened
tobe
present
,
turned
out
an
exceeding
good
speculation
for
mine
host
.
<EOS>
Sots
and
topers
came
from
far
and
near
to
the
Chequers
,
upon
the
chanceof
a
treat
from
“
King
Britton
,
”
as
he
was
commonly
called
,
and
theywould
wait
patiently
drinking
at
their
own
proper
costs
until
the
smithgot
intoxicated
enough
to
act
the
great
man
,
and
order
drink
for
all
athis
own
expense
.
<EOS>
This
acted
well
for
the
landlord
,
whose
liquor
was
constantly
keptflowing
at
some
one
’s
expense
,
and
he
put
up
patiently
with
the
brutaljests
of
the
smith
,
many
of
them
being
accompanied
with
personalill
-
usage
,
rather
then
turn
the
tide
of
prosperity
that
was
pouringinto
his
house
.
<EOS>
Many
were
the
conjectures
as
to
the
source
of
Britton
’s
ample
means;but
<EOS>
although
all
supposed
them
to
proceed
from
some
not
over
honestmeans
,
all
were
so
much
interested
in
their
continuance
that
thecuriosity
excited
produced
no
further
result
than
whispered
expressionsof
wonder
and
wise
shakes
of
the
head
.
<EOS>
It
was
true
that
Britton
had
been
watched
to
Learmont
’s
house
,
but
itnever
for
a
moment
entered
the
heads
of
the
busybodies
at
the
Chequersthat
he
visited
the
great
Squire
Learmont
himself
,
and
whether
or
nothe
had
some
accomplice
at
Learmont
’s
house
,
which
enabled
him
to
robthe
wealthy
squire
,
was
the
only
thought
suggested
by
tracing
him
morethan
once
to
the
hall
door
of
Learmont
’s
<EOS>
princely
and
much
talked
ofabode
.
<EOS>
Daylight
was
commonly
shut
out
of
the
old
oaken
parlour
of
the
Chequersbefore
it
was
all
necessary
,
by
the
orders
of
Britton
,
who
foundhimself
more
at
home
and
enjoyed
his
liquor
better
by
candle
orlamplight
than
with
a
bright
setting
sun
streaming
in
upon
his
drunkenorgies
.
<EOS>
It
was
upon
one
of
these
occasions
that
the
shutters
had
been
closed
bythe
obsequious
landlord
at
least
an
hour
earlier
than
necessary
,
andfor
which
he
had
been
rewarded
by
a
crack
on
the
pate
with
a
pewter
alemeasure
,
and
that
made
him
dance
again
,
that
a
more
than
usuallythronged
company
filled
the
parlor
of
the
ancient
house
.
<EOS>
Britton
sat
in
an
arm
-
chair
in
the
first
stage
of
intoxication
.
<EOS>
Hiseyes
were
inflamed
and
blood
-
shot
,
and
his
whole
visage
betrayed
thedebasing
influence
of
habitual
drunkenness
.
<EOS>
He
wore
a
strange
mixtureof
clothing
;
a
richly
-
laced
coat
which
he
had
bought
from
the
window
ofa
tailor
,
who
had
only
charged
him
double
price
for
it
and
a
kick
,
contrasted
oddly
with
a
coarse
red
night
-
cap
that
he
wore
,
and
the
pipestuck
in
the
buttonholes
of
the
rich
laced
waistcoat
,
presented
astrange
anomaly
of
elegance
and
vulgarity
.
<EOS>
The
company
were
some
smoking
,
some
drinking
,
and
some
talking
;
but
itwas
easy
to
see
that
the
general
attention
was
fixed
upon
Britton
,
whothere
sat
,
as
he
considered
,
in
his
glory
.
<EOS>
“Landlord
!
”
<EOS>
he
roared
,
in
a
voice
that
made
the
glasses
ring
again
.
<EOS>
“Landlord
!
<EOS>
I
say
,
curse
on
you
for
a
sluggish
hand
,
come
hither!Where
’s
your
respect
for
your
king
,
you
keeper
of
bad
butts
—
you
thief
,
<EOS>
you
purloiner
of
honester
men
’s
sack?—Come
hither
<EOS>
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
”“Ha!—Ha
!
”
laughed
a
man
,
who
had
come
a
long
way
to
chance
a
treat
atthe
Chequers—“Ha!—Ha!—That
’s
good
.
<EOS>
Ho!—Ho!”“Who
<EOS>
are
you
?
”
<EOS>
roared
Britton
.
<EOS>
“I
—
<EOS>
I
—
<EOS>
oh
—
I
—
I
—
am
—
a
cordwainer
from
the
Borough
,
sir
.
<EOS>
”“How
<EOS>
dare
you
call
me
,
‘
Sir?’”“Why
—
<EOS>
a
—
a
<EOS>
—
really—”Some
one
here
charitably
whispered
to
the
cordwainer
the
fact
ofBritton
’s
kingly
dignity
!
<EOS>
And
with
many
winks
and
nods
he
correctedhimself
,
and
said,—“I
humbly
beg
your
majesty
’s
most
gracious
pardon
.
<EOS>
”“You
be
d
—
d
!
”
said
Britton
.
<EOS>
“
You
are
a
cordwainer
,
are
you?—A
cobbler
,
you
mean
—
a
patcher
of
leaks
in
bad
shoes
.
<EOS>
Hark
ye
,
Mr.
Cordwainer
,
thenext
time
you
presume
to
laugh
at
anything
I
say
,
I
’ll
make
a
leak
inyour
head
.
<EOS>
”“May
<EOS>
it
please
you
,
King
Britton
,
”
interposed
the
landlord
,
“
<EOS>
I
am
here!”“No
<EOS>
you
ai
n’t
,
”
cried
Britton
,
tripping
up
the
landlord
,
who
forthwithfell
flat
on
the
floor
,
<EOS>
“
you
are
there!”This
was
a
stock
joke
,
and
was
perpetrated
nearly
every
evening
;
so
thecompany
laughed
accordingly
,
particularly
those
who
had
seen
and
heardit
before
,
the
new
-
comers
not
being
fully
up
to
the
wit
of
it
.
<EOS>
Here
the
landlord
rose
,
and
rubbing
the
injured
part
of
his
person
,
said
with
a
groan,—“Well
,
gentlemen
<EOS>
,
did
you
ever
know
the
like
of
that?”“Here
,
come
back
with
a
bowl
of
punch
,
”
cried
Britton
;
“
and
,
do
youhear
,
some
spiced
canary
—
come
,
quick!”“May
<EOS>
I
venture
to
ask
!
”
<EOS>
said
the
landlord
,
still
affecting
to
writhewith
pain
,
“
if
the
spiced
canary
is
to
be
all
round?”“No
,
you
may
not
ask
!
”
<EOS>
said
Britton
;
<EOS>
“
off
with
you!”“We’ll
drink
your
majesty
’s
health
,
”
said
a
pale
thin
man
,
with
greathumility
.
<EOS>
“Oh
,
you
will
,
will
you
?
”
said
Britton
.
<EOS>
“We
<EOS>
will
—
we
will
,
”
cried
many
voices
.
<EOS>
“Drink
away
,
then
!
”
<EOS>
roared
Britton
.
<EOS>
“Your
majesty
has
not
yet
ordered
anything
for
us
to
drink
,
”
said
one
.
<EOS>
“No
<EOS>
,
no
,
his
majesty
do
n’t
mean
,
”
said
Britton
.
<EOS>
“
You
are
a
set
ofrascals
—
thieves
all
.
”“Ah
,
”
said
the
cordwainer
,
casting
his
eyes
up
to
the
fly
-
cage
thathung
from
the
centre
of
the
ceiling
,
“
there
is
a
great
deal
ofdishonesty
in
the
world
.
”“There
<EOS>
ai
n’t
,
and
you
are
a
liar
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Britton
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
the
door
was
flung
open
,
and
a
wild
figure
stood
in
theentrance
taking
up
the
laugh
of
the
guests
in
a
strange
discordanttone
,
and
pointing
the
while
at
the
smith
with
exultant
look
.
<EOS>
Britton
started
from
his
chair
,
but
he
was
scarcely
able
to
stand
,
andstaggering
into
it
again
,
he
muttered,—“Mad
Maud
,
by
all
that
is
damnable!”“Britton
—
Andrew
Britton
!
”
<EOS>
shrieked
Maud
,
clapping
her
hands
together
<EOS>
“
Ihave
found
you
—
Ha!—Ha!—Ha!—I
<EOS>
have
found
you!”The
persons
assembled
in
the
parlour
looked
at
each
other
in
speechlessamazement
,
and
the
majority
of
them
in
the
excitement
of
the
momentfinished
at
once
<EOS>
whatever
liquor
they
had
before
them
.
<EOS>
“Britton!—Britton
!
<EOS>
”
shrieked
Maud
,
“
are
you
not
glad
to
see
me
?
<EOS>
I
heardyour
voice
—
<EOS>
too
well
I
know
it
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
oh
,
I
was
passing
—
<EOS>
I
was
crawlingpast
this
door
when
your
voice
struck
upon
my
ear

<EOS>
Andrew
Britton

Iwon’t
leave

<EOS>
Stop

stop
<EOS>

<EOS>
I
had
it
fromone
of
bright
things
that

among

stars
—
I

errand
.
<EOS>
”She
<EOS>
fumbled
for
a
time
among
her
strange
mass
of
many
-
colouredclothing
,
and
produced
at
length
a
small
piece
of
paper
.
<EOS>
She
gazed
atit
for
a
moment
,
and
then
kissed
it
devotedly
.
<EOS>
“It
saves
me
from
horror
,
”
she
said
,
in
a
low
,
unusual
tone
.
<EOS>
“
It
savesme
from
cramp
and
colds
,
from
the
frost
and
the
scorching
heat
,
but
Iam
bound
to
show
it
to
you
—
all
of
you
shall
see
it

<EOS>
It
is

andwas
given
to

Mad
Maud
by

bright
spirit

<EOS>
Look

do
—
you
,
and
you
,
and
you
.
<EOS>
Are
they
not
brave
words
—
words
to
save
and
bless?”She
glided
among
the
guests
,
and
held
for
a
moment
before
the
eyes
ofeach
the
slip
of
paper
that
Ada
had
given
her
,
till
she
came
near
thesmith
,
when
she
replaced
it
in
her
bosom
,
saying,—“Not
to
you
,
man
of
blood
—
not
to
you
.
<EOS>
Ho!—Ho
!
<EOS>
Andrew
Britton
,
not
toyou!”The
smith
had
sat
till
now
as
if
paralyzed
;
but
,
when
Maud
was
makingfor
the
door
,
he
suddenly
cried
with
a
tone
of
anger
,
while
his
faceswelled
with
wild
passion,—“Hold
—
stop
that
witch
!
<EOS>
Kill
her
—
tear
her
to
pieces
—
curses
on
her!”He
rushed
forward
as
he
spoke
,
and
would
most
probably
have
done
thepoor
creature
some
fatal
injury
,
had
he
not
been
suddenly
stopped
by
atall
,
stout
man
,
who
rushed
from
a
corner
of
the
room
,
upsettingseveral
persons
in
his
progress
,
and
placed
himself
before
Maud
.
<EOS>
“Stop
!
”
<EOS>
he
cried
,
in
a
voice
of
command—“touch
the
woman
at
your
peril
.
<EOS>
”For
<EOS>
a
moment
Britton
paused
,
while
his
face
worked
with
fury
,
and
hemore
nearly
resembled
some
wild
animal
at
bay
than
a
human
being
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
then
,
collecting
all
his
energies
,
he
sprang
forward
with
acry
of
rage
;
but
the
stranger
adroitly
stepped
on
one
side
,
at
the
sametime
that
he
threw
a
chair
,
on
which
he
had
his
hand
,
across
Britton’spath
,
who
fell
over
it
with
great
violence
.
<EOS>
Britton
lay
a
moment
as
ifstunned
by
the
fall
,
and
several
of
the
company
began
to
cry
shame
uponthe
stranger
,
who
stood
quite
calm
awaiting
the
rise
of
his
foe
.
<EOS>
The
landlord
,
however
,
who
had
witnessed
some
of
the
affair
from
thebar
,
now
rushed
in
in
a
state
of
great
indignation
with
the
stranger
,
for
not
allowing
King
Britton
to
do
just
what
he
liked
.
<EOS>
“Troop
out
of
my
house
,
”
he
cried
.
<EOS>
“
How
dare
you
insult
a
customer
ofmine
?
<EOS>
Troop
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
Go
after

You

<EOS>
”“Suppose

<EOS>
said
the

.
<EOS>
“Then

cried
the
enraged
landlord
.
<EOS>
“You

said
the

<EOS>
“Now
by
the
mass
that
beats

“

Was

<EOS>
”The
stranger
laughed
in
spite
of
himself
at
this
last
remark
of
thelandlord
’s
and
turning
to
the

,
he
said,—“Every
one
here
present
<EOS>
can
witness
that
I
only
interfered
with
thisdrunken
ruffian
to
prevent
him
from
committing
an
assault
upon
amaniac
,
and
his
present
condition
arises
partly
from
intoxication
,
andpartly
from
falling
over
a
chair
in
an
attempt
to
attack
me
.
<EOS>
”“You
are
a
scoundrel
,
”
said
the
landlord
.
<EOS>
“Out
with
him
!
<EOS>
Turn
him
out
!
”
<EOS>
cried
the
company
,
with
one
voice
.
<EOS>
“My
staff
!
<EOS>
My
staff
!
”
<EOS>
roared
the
landlord
,
gathering
courage
from
theunanimous
support
<EOS>
he
seemed
likely
to
receive
.
<EOS>
“You
<EOS>
need
not
trouble
yourself
for
your
staff

”
said
the
stranger
,
“
Iam
going

and
if
you
required
a

I
,
could
lend
you
mine

”The
stranger
took
from
his
pocket
,
as
he
spoke
,
a
small
bright
silverstaff

<EOS>
“W
<EOS>

<EOS>
Who
—
who
are
you

<EOS>
stammered
the
landlord
.
<EOS>
“It
<EOS>
matters
not
just
now
who
I
am
,
”
said
the
stranger
,
“
but
look
toyour
house
,
sir
—
it
has
grown
disorderly
of
late
.
<EOS>
”With
<EOS>
a
slow
step
the
stranger
then
left
the
room
,
amid
an
universalstare
of
astonishment
from
the
company
.
<EOS>
“Well
,
I
never
—
”
cried
the
landlord
,
“
a
silver
staff

<EOS>
He
belongs
to
theoffice

<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>

you
wanted

out

said
the
cordwainer
.
<EOS>
“Landlord
,
you

said
another

<EOS>
“The

a

”
cried
a
third
.
<EOS>
“Not

”
cried
a
fourth
.
<EOS>
“Ah

ah

”
<EOS>
chimed
in
three
or
four
more
.
<EOS>
“Why
—
why
you
all
called
turn
him
out
,
”
said
the
discomfited
landlord
.
<EOS>
“Ah

said
the
man
who
had
prepared
to
drink

<EOS>
”“Yes

<EOS>
cried
everybody
;
“
we
meant

out

<EOS>
”“The

Britton
,
recovering
from
his
mixed
state
of
insensibility
,
produced
by
drink
and
a
blow
of
his
head
against
the
floor
.
<EOS>
“Was

it
true

”
<EOS>
continued
Britton
<EOS>
;
“
where
the
devil
am
I
now
?
<EOS>
Can’tyou
speak
,
none
of
you?”The
landlord
turned
to
the
company
,
and
placed
his
fingersconfidentially
and
knowingly
against
the
side
of
his
nose
,
inintimation
that
he
was
about
to
perpetrate
some
piece
of
extremecleverness
not
quite
consistent
with
truth
.
<EOS>
Then
,
turning
to
Britton
,
he
said
in
a
commiserating
tone,—“Good
luck
,
Master
King
Britton
,
your
majesty
certainly
took
fortywinks
in
a
chair
,
and
by
some
sudden
move
,
it
has
upset
your
majesty
.
<EOS>
”“Is
<EOS>
—
is
—
that
it
?
”
said
Britton
,
looking
around
him
with
heavy
eyes
.
<EOS>
“Yes
all
these
honourable
gentlemen
can
bear
me
out
in
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
”“Curse
<EOS>
me
,
then
,
if
ever
I
had
such
a
dream
,
”
said
Britton
.
<EOS>
“All
<EOS>
dreams
are
very
disagreeable
,
”
said
the
landlord
.
<EOS>
“Oh
,
very
!
”
said
the
company
.
<EOS>
“D
—
<EOS>
n
you
all
,
”
muttered
Britton
.
<EOS>
The
landlord
now
turned
again
to
the
company
,
and
favoured
them
withanother
bit
of
facetiousness
,
which
consisted
in
rubbing
his
left
elbowand
going
through
the
motion
of
drinking
in
dumb
show
;
and
having
sobespoken
their
kind
and
considerate
attention
,
he
turned
to
Britton
,
and
added,—“Your
worship
’s
majesty
had
just
ordered
cans
of
spiced
canary
allround
,
as
you
went
off
to
sleep
like
a
babe
.
<EOS>
”“Had

”
growled
Britton
;
“
I
suppose
they
all
had
it
then?”“No
,
no

no

”
<EOS>
cried
a
chorus
of
voices
.
<EOS>
“Quite
sure?”“Oh
,
quite

<EOS>
”“Then
I
’ll
be
d
—
d
if
you
get
it!”The
landlord
looked
rather
taken
aback
by
this
,
and
rubbed
his
chin
inan
abstracted
manner
with
his
apron
,
while
the
guests
looked
at
eachother
in
consternation
.
<EOS>
“What
are
you
staring
at

all
of
you

”
<EOS>
cried
Britton
.
<EOS>
“
You

<EOS>
“Then

”
<EOS>
added
Britton
,
staggeringto
the
door
,
and
as
he
passed
out
he
muttered
to
himself,—“A

XXXIV.The
Fête.—Villany
Prospers
for
a
Season.—An
<EOS>
Interruption.—The
Dance
.
<EOS>
That
night
the
halls
of
the
princely
residence
of
Learmont
presented
tothe
eye
one
blaze
of
light
,
brilliant
costumes
,
costly
decorations
,
andeverything
that
his
imagination
could
suggest
as
calculated
to
entrancethe
senses
,
and
convey
a
notion
of
his
boundless
wealth
and
unlimitedprodigality
.
<EOS>
Learmont
was
now
in
truth
carrying
out
to
its
utmost
themode
of
life
he
had
so
often
proposed
to
himself
as
that
alone
whichcould
smother
the
stings
of
conscience
,
and
by
not
allowing
him
time
tothink
of
the
past
,
enable
him
to
extract
some
enjoyment
from
the
gaudyglittering
present
.
<EOS>
To
the
entertainment
which
he
now
gave
,
he
invited
scores
of
personswhich
he
knew
only
by
name
,
but
who
scrupled
not
to
accept
the
biddingof
a
man
who
was
supposed
to
be
rich
beyond
all
comparison
.
<EOS>
There
were
members
of
Parliament
—
of
both
houses
,
holy
ministers
of
thechurch
,
high
legal
functionaries
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
Learmont
,
from
the
mererumour
of
his
enormous
wealth
—
a
rumour
which
he
had
himself
originated
,
and
to
which
he
lent
countenance
by
his
great
expenses
,
found
nodifficulty
in
filling
his
saloons
with
all
that
were
consideredillustrious
or
great
in
the
metropolis
.
<EOS>
Learmont
was
not
a
man
to
allow
anything
to
be
wanting
at
such
anentertainment
as
that
he
was
now
giving
.
<EOS>
He
possessed
education
,
talent
,
and
taste
,
although
all
were
perverted
by
the
utter
absence
ofall
moral
feeling
in
his
mind
.
<EOS>
The
most
delightful
music
,
breathing
low
dulcet
sounds
,
mingled
sweetlyand
harmoniously
,
with
the
hum
of
conversation
among
his
courtlyguests
.
<EOS>
The
saloons
rivalled
the
mid
-
day
splendour
of
a
summer
’s
day
,
by
the
colour
and
profusion
of
the
lights
,
which
lent
a
charm
toeverything
within
their
glittering
influence
.
<EOS>
There
were
beaufets
loaded
with
costly
luxuries
,
to
which
the
guestshelped
themselves
at
discretion
;
and
all
this
,
heightened
as
it
was
bybrilliant
costumes
,
civil
and
military
,
created
a
scene
of
magnificencethat
astonished
and
delighted
every
one
there
to
witness
it
.
<EOS>
The
guests
would
congregate
together
in
small
knots,—those
who
kneweach
other
,
to
wonder
at
the
glory
and
enchantment
around
them
,
andmany
were
the
whispered
surmises
as
to
how
the
owner
of
such
riches
hadspent
his
early
life
,
when
now
he
manifested
so
prodigal
a
spirit
,
andshowed
such
rare
taste
and
royal
magnificence
in
his
mode
of
life
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
more
superstitious
would
have
it
that
he
was
an
alchemist
,
and
had
discovered
the
transmutation
of
metals
,
by
which
he
could
turnlead
and
copper
to
gold
.
<EOS>
Others
looked
upon
it
with
the
jaundiced
eyeof
party
politics
upon
the
scene
,
and
whispered
to
a
friend
that
thelord
of
so
much
wealth
must
be
a
spy
in
the
service
of
the
dethronedfamily
,
whose
rights
,
real
or
fancied
,
were
not
at
that
period
,
set
atrest
in
this
realm
.
<EOS>
It
was
strange
that
<EOS>
but
one
of
all
the
guests
of
Learmont
suggested
aprobably
and
creditable
mode
of
accounting
for
his
great
wealth
,
andsudden
freak
of
spending
it
;
that
was
that
he
had
lived
many
years
inmelancholy
seclusion
,
making
mercantile
ventures
secretly
with
hislarge
revenues
,
which
proving
successful
,
had
placed
some
enormous
sumat
his
disposal
,
the
possession
of
which
had
dazzled
his
brain
,
andinduced
him
to
fly
from
the
pecuniary
economy
to
that
of
profuse
andlavish
expenditure
.
<EOS>
This
supposition
was
,
however
,
far
too
commonplace
and
reasonable
tofind
many
supporters
,
and
the
majority
decidedly
inclined
to
the
moremarvellous
opinion
.
<EOS>
Learmont
himself
,
attired
in
a
handsome
dress
,
which
set
off
his
tallfigure
to
the
best
advantage
,
seemed
upon
this
occasion
to
have
castoff
his
habitual
gloom
and
asperity
of
manner
.
<EOS>
He
mingled
freely
withhis
guests
,
jesting
with
one
,
discussing
some
knotty
political
pointwith
another
in
forcible
and
lofty
language
,
cautiously
complimenting
athird
,
and
in
fact
,
winning
from
all
those
golden
opinions
which
everwait
upon
a
known
cold
,
proud
,
and
haughty
man
,
when
he
chooses
tounbend
himself
,
and
make
an
effort
to
become
agreeable
.
<EOS>
By
degrees
,
however
,
he
confined
almost
all
his
attention
to
a
fewwell
-
known
political
characters
who
were
at
the
fête
,
and
who
were
theagents
of
ministers
in
the
barter
of
a
baronetcy
for
a
certain
sum
ofmoney
invested
in
parliamentary
seats
with
Learmont
.
<EOS>
This
baronetcy
toprocure
which
Learmont
had
lent
all
his
abilities
of
intrigue
,
hefairly
considered
as
the
first
grand
step
up
the
ladder
of
ambition;for
even
supposing
the
remote
probability
of
his
legitimate
claim
tothe
<EOS>
Learmont
estates
to
be
disputed
successfully
,
he
would
still
havehigher
dignities
of
his
own
acquisition
to
fall
back
upon
.
<EOS>
Thus
it
will
be
seen
that
the
wily
Learmont
was
playing
a
complicatedgame
of
public
ambition
,
while
at
the
same
time
,
he
was
privatelytortured
by
doubts
and
fears
,
concerning
the
fidelity
of
hisaccomplices
in
crime
—
the
crafty
Jacob
Gray
,
and
the
dissipated
andruffianly
Britton
.
<EOS>
The
fête
was
to
conclude
with
a
ball
in
a
style
of
unparalleledsplendour
:
<EOS>
one
of
the
largest
of
the
saloons
had
been
fitted
up
as
theball
-
room
,
in
a
style
of
costly
and
rare
elegance
;
the
chalked
flooringalone
costing
five
hundred
pounds
in
execution
,
it
being
designed
bysome
of
the
first
artists
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
This
room
was
kept
carefully
closed
,
until
Learmont
himself
shouldperceive
that
his
guests
were
desirous
of
some
changes
of
amusement
,
when
upon
a
signal
given
by
him
,
the
folding
doors
were
to
be
thrownopen
.
<EOS>
This
signal
he
did
not
give
until
late
;
and
he
had
been
assured
of
thebaronetcy
in
the
following
week
,
before
he
fancied
it
time
to
changethe
scene
.
<EOS>
“Your
<EOS>
exceedingly
patriotic
conduct
,
sir
<EOS>
,
”
said
an
eminent
politicalpersonage
present
,
“
has
been
represented
to
his
majesty
,
who
at
onceacceded
to
the
proposed
baronetcy
,
which
he
was
gracious
enough
to
sayshould
be
<EOS>
but
the
prelude
to
much
greater
things
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
trust
that
my
future
patriotism
will
be
equally
appreciated,”replied
Learmont
,
courteously
,
and
with
the
smallest
dash
of
satire
inhis
manner
;
“
the
next
step
up
the
ladder
of
nobility
,
I
am
quite
awareis
not
so
easy
of
access
.
<EOS>
”“Real
<EOS>
patriotism
,
”
replied
the
political
personage
,
with
,
a
low
bow
toLearmont
,
“
will
accomplish
wonders
.
”“Would
<EOS>
three
more
seats
in
the
Commons
be
of
service
to
the
minister?”said
Learmont
,
in
a
low
tone
.
<EOS>
“I
should
say
,
decidedly
,
”
replied
the
other
in
a
suppressed
voice;“and
a
-
hem
,
Baron
Learmont
would
sound
well
.
”“There
<EOS>
is
nothing
like
patriotism
,
”
said
the
squire
.
<EOS>
“Oh
!
<EOS>
Nothing
,
”
replied
the
political
personage
.
<EOS>
“And
it
should
be
rewarded
.
<EOS>
”“I
quite
agree
with
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
”Learmont
<EOS>
then
took
another
round
of
his
saloons
,
and
conversed
gailyand
appropriately
with
several
groups
of
his
guests
.
<EOS>
A
new
arrival
was
now
announced
,
which
Learmont
had
been
most
anxiouslylooking
for
.
<EOS>
Not
the
least
important
of
the
schemes
of
Learmont
was
tounite
himself
by
marriage
to
some
noble
and
influential
family
,
whowould
feel
their
own
dignity
and
importance
interested
in
upholding
himagainst
any
untoward
circumstance
that
might
occur
of
a
nature
<EOS>
todepreciate
him
;
and
the
announcement
that
now
greeted
his
ears
,
of
thearrival
of
Lord
Brereton
,
Lady
Brereton
,
and
the
Honourable
GeorgianaBrereton
,
their
only
daughter
,
was
the
most
welcome
that
had
occurred
.
<EOS>
This
family
had
all
the
mean
,
proud
vices
of
the
aristocracy
,
withscarcely
any
of
their
redeeming
virtues
;
but
they
were
of
ancient
race
,
and
numbered
among
their
connexions
all
the
principal
nobles
ofEngland
,
claiming
likewise
a
distant
alliance
with
royalty
itself
.
<EOS>
Her
father
was
one
of
those
men
who
fancy
they
and
their
extravagancieshave
some
sort
of
claim
upon
society
at
large
for
support
,
and
allthoughts
of
usefulness
or
prudence
were
with
him
quite
out
of
thequestion
,
and
derogatory
to
his
dignity
.
<EOS>
The
family
estates
weremortgaged
to
the
last
farthing
;
the
family
plate
and
diamonds
were
onlytheir
possession
on
hire
from
the
money
scriveners
.
<EOS>
Still
the
income
ofLord
Brereton
was
immense
,
for
he
was
in
various
shapes
<EOS>
quartered
uponthe
public
purse
as
a
holder
of
sinecure
appointments
with
largesalaries
,
on
account
of
his
high
birth
.
<EOS>
His
lady
was
silly
,
weak
,
and
egotistical
—
the
Honourable
GeorgianaBrereton
,
it
was
well
understood
,
was
for
sale
to
the
highest
bidder;she
was
proud
,
supercilious
,
and
handsome
.
<EOS>
Lord
Brereton

upon
his
daughter
anestate
worth
ten
thousand
pounds
per
annum
,
always
provided
the
happyman
who
made
her
his
wife
was
in
a
condition
to
advance
the
sumnecessary
to
redeem
the
title
deeds
from
the
money

lenders
.
<EOS>
Thereforewas
the
Honourable
Georgiana
Brereton
,
with
all
her
pride
and
all
herinsolence
,
put
up
for
sale
at
the
goodly
sum
claimed
by
divers
lords
asmortgagees
of
the
estate
which
was
to
be
settled
upon
her
.
<EOS>
Into
this
family
Learmont
thought
it
policy
to
enter
.
<EOS>
They
had
all
theinfluence
of
high
rank
,
and
were
unscrupulous
in
using
it
.
<EOS>
For
theHonourable
Georgiana
he
cared
no
more
than
for
the
feathers
that
dancedin
her
head
-
dress
.
<EOS>
She
might
be
proud
,
haughty
,
insolent
,
silly
,
buther
pride
was
nothing
to
his
;
her
haughtiness
must
cringe
before
his
,
associated
as
his
was
with
intellect
of
a
high
order
.
<EOS>
Her
indolence
,
too
,
he
could
treat
with
contempt
.
<EOS>
She
was
,
in
his
eyes
,
merely
one
ofthe
props
to
his
ambition
,
and
he
approached
the
family
,
that
hedespised
in
his
heart
,
with
a
smile
of
welcome
of
the
most
engagingcharacter
he
could
assume
.
<EOS>
“Welcome
to
my
humble
house
,
”
said
Learmont
;
“
no
longer
humble
,
however
,
when
graced
by
your
presence
,
ladies
.
<EOS>
”Lady
<EOS>
Brereton
bowed
,
and
agitated
all
her
feathers
,
while
thehonourable
daughter
took
no
notice
whatever
of
the
courteous
salutationof
the
master
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
“You
are
well
lodged
here
,
sir
,
”
remarked
Lord
Brereton
.
<EOS>
“
I
hear
it
ishis
Majesty
’s
intention
to
create
a
baronetcy
for
you
.
<EOS>
”“His
Majesty
is
very
gracious
,
”
replied
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“I
think
it
judicious
,
”
added
the
lord
;
<EOS>
“
wealth
should
never
be
allowedto
<EOS>
remain
in
the
hands
of
untitled
persons
.
<EOS>
Either
they
,
if
fitted
,
should
be
raised
to
rank
,
or
the
wealth
should
be
by
some
means
takenfrom
them
.
”“There
<EOS>
is
much
sound
philosophy
in
what
your
lordship
says
,
”
answeredLearmont
.
<EOS>
“It
<EOS>
is
my
opinion
,
”
said
Lord
Brereton
,
with
affected
dignity
.
<EOS>
“Certainly
,
”
added
Learmont
;
“
and
that
should
be
sufficient
to
settlethe
question
for
ever
,
my
lord
.
”Lord
<EOS>
Brereton
bowed
stiffly
.
<EOS>
Learmont
now
cast
his
eyes
around
the
saloon
,
and
fancying
he
saw
anair
of
satiety
creeping
over
his
guests
,
he
resolved
upon
opening
theball
-
room
,
which
he
felt
sure
would
give
an
impetus
to
the
flaggingspirits
of
the
company
,
who
were
really
getting
tired
of
the
incessantglitter
of
all
around
them

Ball

room.—A
<EOS>
Noble
Family.—The
Interruption.—Unexpected
End
ofLearmont
’s
Fête
.
<EOS>
Clapping
his
hands
as
a
signal
to
the
attendants
,
who
were
in
waiting
,
the
whole
of
one
end
of
the
saloon
vanished
,
as
if
by
magic
,
being
slidaway
like
a
scene
at
a
theatre
,
and
disclosed
the
magnificentball
-
room
,
brilliantly
illuminated
,
and
adorned
with
the
most
exquisiteplants
and
flowers
.
<EOS>
A
murmur
of
delight
and
astonishment
at
thesuddenness
of
the
change
arose
among
the
guests
,
and
then
the
youngerportion
eagerly
pressed
forward
to
enjoy
the
delight
of
the
dance
.
<EOS>
A
choice
band
of
music
struck
up
in
an
enlivening
strain
,
and
in
a
fewmoments
,
scarcely
a
guest
remained
in
the
first
saloon
,
in
which
,
thenumerous
domestics
began
to
lay
a
costly
supper
.
<EOS>
Even
the
apathetic
Georgiana
Brereton
condescended
to
remark
to
hernoble
mother
that
the
poor
man
,
meaning
Learmont
,
ought
not
to
beblamed
or
despised
,
for
he
was
evidently
doing
his
best
,
to
which
themother
replied
,
in
an
affected
languid
tone,—“Certainly
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
They
say
he
is
very
rich
.
<EOS>
I
declare
it
’s
quitesinful
for
people
with
no
names
at
all
to
have
the
means
of
doing
thesethings
.
<EOS>
”“Papa
says
,
”
added
the
young
lady
,
who
,
by
-
the
-
by
,
was
thirty
years
ofage
,
“
papa
says
that
the
Learmont
family
came
in
with
the
conquest
,
asa
Learmont
was
a
standard
-
bearer
to
William
.
”“Indeed
,
my
love
!
<EOS>
Well
,
there
is
something
in
that
,
and
should
hepropose
,
we
can
make
inquiry
.
”“Exactly
,
”
drawled
the
daughter
.
<EOS>
The
ball
-
room
was
now
filled
with
the
guests
,
and
altogether
,
a
morebrilliant
spectacle
could
scarcely
be
conceived
.
<EOS>
Learmont
made
a
signal
to
the
musicians
to
cease
playing
,
while
thepartners
were
chosen
for
the
dance
.
<EOS>
With
a
gallant
air
,
he
stepped
upto
the
Brereton
party
,
and
offered
his
hand
to
the
HonourableGeorgiana
,
which
was
graciously
accepted
,
so
far
as
the
tips
of
thatyoung
lady
<EOS>
’s
fingers
extended
.
<EOS>
All
eyes
were
upon
him
and
his
patrician
partner
as
he
led
her
acrossthe
richly
-
chalked
floor
.
<EOS>
There
was
an
impressive
silence
for
a
fewseconds
,
when
from
a
side
-
door
a
servant
appeared
,
and
gliding
amongthe
guests
,
approached
Learmont
,
and
stood
for
a
moment
as
if
he
hadsomething
to
say
to
him
.
<EOS>
“Well
,
knave
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Learmont
,
his
face
slightly
flushed
with
anger
,
atbeing
interrupted
at
that
moment
.
<EOS>
“An
<EOS>
please
you
,
sir
,
there
—
there
—
is—”The
<EOS>
Honourable
Georgiana
tossed
her
plumed
head
with
a
look
of
greatdispleasure
,
and
Learmont
forgetting
everything
on
the
impulse
of
themoment
,
cried
angrily,—“Speak
your
message
,
sirrah!”“A
message
from
the
Old
Smithy
,
”
said
the
trembling
servant
.
<EOS>
Learmont
’s
cheek
blanched
in
an
instant
,
and
<EOS>
his
lips
quivered
withagitation
.
<EOS>
“How
dare
you
?
”
<EOS>
he
gasped
.
<EOS>
“An
<EOS>
please
your
honour
,
”
said
the
man
,
in
a
submissive
tone
,
“
yourhonour
ordered
that
—
the
—
the
—
message
from
the
Old
Smithy
should
bealways
brought
to
your
honour
,
and
—
he
—
he
wo
n’t
go
away
<EOS>
—
he
—
has
knockedout
two
of
Timothy
’s
teeth
,
<EOS>

,
besides
,
he
—
he—”“Peace

”
<EOS>
cried
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“
Peace
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
Ho
!
<EOS>
Music
there
—
<EOS>
music!”The
band
immediately
struck
up
an
enlivening
air
,
and
the
guests
gazedat
Learmont
with
bewildered
looks
,
for
he
presented
more
the
appearanceof
<EOS>
a
madman
than
the
high
-
bred
courteous
gentleman
he
had
seemed
duringthe
evening
.
<EOS>
The
servant
slowly
retreated
,
but
Learmont
could
not
,
dared
not
,
lethim
go
without
some
answer
to
the
savage
.
<EOS>
“Will
<EOS>
your
ladyship
excuse
me
one
moment
?
”
<EOS>
he
said
to
the
HonourableGeorgiana
Brereton
,
in
an
agitated
manner
.
<EOS>
“For
as
many
as
you
please
,
sir
,
”
answered
the
haughty
damsel
,
with
atone
of
pique
and
insolence
.
<EOS>
Learmont
strode
after
the
servant
,
and
just
as
the
latter
reached
thedoor
,
he
caught
,
him
,
and
said,—“Tell
him
to
wait
.
<EOS>
”“Yes
,
your
honour
,
”
said
the
servant
.
<EOS>
Learmont
hurried
back
to
where
he
had
left
the
honourable
lady
,
but
shewas
not
there
.
<EOS>
He
glanced
hurriedly
around
him
,
and
saw
her
with
hernoble
relatives
at
a
distant
part
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
In
a
minute
he
was
withthem
.
<EOS>
“Pardon
<EOS>
my
rudeness
,
”
he
said
,
“
in
leaving
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
a
bachelor
,
andhave
so
many
troublesome
domestic
matters
to
arrange
that
I
amcompelled
sometimes
to
appear
rude
where
I
would
most
of
all
wish
to
beotherwise
.
<EOS>
”“The
interruption
,
”
said
the
young
lady
,
“
was
so
very
extraordinary
.
<EOS>
”“Yes
—
<EOS>
a
—
a
—
rather
an
ill
-
bred
knave
,
”
said
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“
My
servants
want
amistress
sadly
.
<EOS>
”“Such
<EOS>
a
strange
thing
in
a
ball
-
room
,
”
added
Georgiana
.
<EOS>
“Eh
!
”
said
Lord
Brereton
.
<EOS>
“
If
it
be
pronounceable
,
my
dear
,
what
wasit?”“Oh
,
a
mere
nothing
,
”
said
Learmont
;
“
an
absurd
mistake
.
<EOS>
Is
not
that
adivine
strain
they
are
playing?”“Delightful
!
”
<EOS>
said
the
lady
.
<EOS>
“
But
the
words
were
a
message
from
the
OldSmithy!”“The
old
who
?
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Lord
Brereton
,
with
a
shrug
.
<EOS>
“The
Old
Smithy
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
pretend
to
know
what
it
means
.
”“Frightful
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Lady
Brereton
.
<EOS>
Learmont
tried
to
smile
,
but
the
distortion
of
his
features
looked
asif
occasioned
by
some
acute
pain
rather
than
any
sensation
approachingto
the
mirthful
.
<EOS>
“It
<EOS>
was
most
absurd
,
”
he
said
,
“
and
might
make
one
angry
,
but
that
itis
too
laughable
.
<EOS>
”As
<EOS>
he
spoke
a
voice
behind
him
said
in
a
tone
of
tremblingapprehension,—“And
<EOS>
it
please
your
honour
—
he
—
he—”Learmont
positively
gasped
,
and
clutched
the
back
of
a
chair
forsupport
,
as
he
turned
and
faced
another
servant
,
the
former
one
beingafraid
to
venture
into
the
presence
of
his
fiery
master
again
.
<EOS>
“W
<EOS>
—
what
now
?
”
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
“He
wo
n’t
go
,
an
it
please
your
honour
.
<EOS>
”“Won’t
go
?
”
<EOS>
echoed
Learmont
,
<EOS>
in
such
a
confusion
of
mind
that
hescarcely
knew
what
he
said
,
and
the
servant
,
emboldened
by
the
apparentplacidity
of
his
master
,
added,—“No
,
your
honour
,
and
he
says
he
wo
n’t
wait
either
.
”“Thrust
<EOS>
him
from
my
door
,
”
shrieked
Learmont
;
“
kill
him
—
no
—
no
—
tell
himto
come
to
-
morrow
—
<EOS>
yes
,
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
”Learmont
<EOS>
’s
noble
guests
looked
at
each
other
in
mute
surprise
.
<EOS>
Thevoice
in
which
Learmont
had
spoken
was
loud
and
strange
,
and
attractedall
eyes
to
the
spot
on
which
he
stood
.
<EOS>
A
glance
around
the
ball
-
roomat
once
showed
him
that
he
was
the
observed
of
all
,
and
he
felt
thenecessity
of
controlling
his
passion
.
<EOS>
“The
dance
,
the
dance
<EOS>
,
”
he
cried
;
“
the
most
precious
hours
of
gladnessand
joy
.
<EOS>
The
dance
!
<EOS>
The
dance!”These
words
were
scarcely
spoken
,
when
his
attention
was
arrested
by
anunusual
commotion
at
the
further
end
of
the
saloon
,
accompanied
bycries
,
the
trampling
of
feet
,
and
a
few
oaths
,
which
sounded
strangelyin
that
gaudy
scene
.
<EOS>
Learmont
’s
heart
sunk
within
him
,
and
at
that
moment
he
suffered
a
panggreater
than
any
he
had
ever
power
to
inflict
,
as
the
conviction
cameacross
his
mind
that
Britton
was
forcing
his
way
into
the
ball
-
room
,
despite
of
every
obstacle
.
<EOS>
This
was
an
event
which
could
not
have
happened
under
ordinarycircumstances
,
but
the
whole
of
Learmont
’s
household
were
aware
thatthe
strange
man
who
came
with
the
message
from
the
Old
Smithy
had
somesort
of
power
over
their
master
and
their
ignorance
of
its
extent
,
paralysed
their
exertions
in
opposing
his
entrance
to
the
ball
-
room
,
although
had
they
felt
themselves
free
to
act
,
he
would
never
havereached
beyond
the
hall
of
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
Thus
it
was
that
the
proud
,
wealthy
,
and
haughty
Learmont
,
surroundedby
troops
of
servants
,
and
evidently
exercising
the
most
despotic
swayover
them
appeared
to
his
assembled
guests
in
the
curious
and
anomalousposition
of
being
unable
to
keep
a
drunken
brawler
from
the
verypenetralia
of
his
mansion
.
<EOS>
Too
well
the
squire
knew
the
voice
of
the
smith
not
to
feel
convincedthat
it
was
he
,
who
in
some
freak
of
wilfulness
or
drunkenness
was
thusinvading
his
gay
saloons
.
<EOS>
Defy
him
,
he
dared
not
;
kill
him
he
darednot
;
nay
,
it
was
questionable
if
he
dared
even
be
rude
to
the
burly
,
and
perhaps
infuriated
savage
.
<EOS>
A
deep
groan
burst
from
Learmont’slabouring
breast
,
as
the
conviction
came
across
his
mind
<EOS>
quicker
thanwe
can
relate
the
various
steps
of
thought
that
led
to
it
,
that
hewould
always
be
subject
to
these
visitations
,
even
in
his
hours
ofgreatest
enjoyment
,
when
he
was
making
the
attempt
to
drown
reflectionsin
a
crowd
of
the
gay
and
the
trifling
.
<EOS>
None
of
the
guests
seemed
disposed
to
place
themselves
in
the
way
ofBritton
,
and
when
the
contest
ceased
between
him
and
the
servants
,
which
it
did
at
the
door
of
the
ball
-
room
,
he
found
himself
free
andunimpeded
.
<EOS>
With
a
reeling
gait
he
walked
to
the
very
centre
of
the
splendidapartment
,
and
for
the
space
of
about
a
minute
he
seemed
confused
andhalf
stupified
by
the
glare
of
light
around
;
and
the
brilliant
costumesand
decorations
that
everywhere
met
his
drunken
gaze
.
<EOS>
“Hulloa
!
”
<EOS>
he
cried
at
length
,
“
the
squire
’s
coming
out
at
last
.
<EOS>
Adance

<EOS>
There

here
to

brain
danceagain
;
what
do
you
all
stare
at

for
?
<EOS>
I
came
with
a
message
from
theOld
Smithy
—
<EOS>
tell
that
to
the
squire
,
and
then
hear
what
he
says
.
<EOS>
Ho
—
ho
—
ho
!
<EOS>
We

very
old

I

What

—
his
life
I

—
Hurrah
for

<EOS>
Adance

<EOS>
Hurrah!”Britton
had
all
the
ball
-
room
nearly
to
himself
,
for
the
guests
shrankfrom
him
on
all
sides
,
and
Learmont
seemed
for
the
moment
completelyunmanned
and
powerless
.
<EOS>
Shaking
off
,
however
,
by
a
violent
effort
the
confusion
of
his
senses
,
he
suddenly
advanced
and
confronted
Britton
.
<EOS>
The
smith
shrunk
for
a
moment
before
the
pale
face
of
Learmont
,
inwhich
was
an
expression
of
concentrated
rage
and
hate
that
might
wellhave
appalled
even
a
far
bolder
man
.
<EOS>
Britton
,
however
,
was
not
in
a
state
to
admit
of
any
moral
control;drink
was
inflaming
his
brain
,
and
there
was
a
recklessness
about
himthat
,
if
not
carefully
treated
,
might
involve
both
Learmont
and
himselfin
one
common
destruction
.
<EOS>
The
haughty
squire
felt
fully
the
precarious
situation
in
which
hestood
,
and
therefore
was
it
that
in
the
midst
of
a
wild
passion
thatmade
him
tremble
,
he
felt
obliged
to
temporise
with
the
man
whoselife
<EOS>
’s
blood
flowing
at
his
feet
would
scarcely
have
satisfied
hisfeelings
of
awful
hatred
.
<EOS>
“Andrew
Britton
,
”
he
said
,
in
a
half
-
choked
voice
,
which
he
wished
noone
to
hear
but
the
smith
.
<EOS>
“Well
<EOS>
,
Squire
Learmont
,
”
replied
the
ruffian
,
endeavouring
to
standsteadily
the
fixed
gaze
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
“For
<EOS>
your
own
life
’s
sake
go
away
from
here
<EOS>
—
you

drunk

”“Drunk

?
<EOS>
Well
,

a

drunk
before

<EOS>
do

want?”“Ten

)

<EOS>

<EOS>

Never

<EOS>
Hurrah

<EOS>
Hurrah!”“Are
you
mad
?
”
said
Learmont
.
<EOS>
To
his
agony
the
squire
now
observed
that
,
impelled
by
curiosity
,
hisguests
were
slowly
creeping
closer
around
him
and
the
savage
smith
.
<EOS>
Heraised
his
voice
suddenly
and
cried—“My
noble
and
honoured
guests
,
this
is
a
poor
mad
fellow
,
who
frommotives

”“Oh

hiccupped
Britton
;
“
that

all

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
Let

”“Another

”
cried
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“No

<EOS>

the

<EOS>

so
very
un

<EOS>
I

—
<EOS>
quite
mad
,
”
said
Learmont
,
striving
to
stop
the
smith
.
<EOS>
“Beware
,
”
said
Britton
,
with
drunken
solemnity
.
<EOS>
“
I

<EOS>
He

Thank

<EOS>
”This
<EOS>
last
observation
was
addressed
to
the
Honourable
GeorgianaBrereton
,
who
having
given
her
head
a
toss
of
disdain
upon
meeting
theanxious
eye
of
the
confounded
Learmont
,
imparted
such
a
noddingreaction
for
some
seconds
to
her
feathers
that
the
intoxicated
smithtook
it
as
a
complimentary
acknowledgment
of
his
invitation
to
theChequers
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
guests
now
began
to
laugh
,
and
others
to
complain
to
eachother
in
no
very
measured
terms
of
the
intrusion
among
them
,
of
so
veryquestionable
a
character
as
the
smith
appeared
to
be
;
while
several
,
among
whom
were
the
Brereton
family
,
made
a
move
to
depart
,
fearful
howthe
singular
scene
would
end
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
Learmont
had
his
hand
on
his
sword
hilt
,
and
the
turn
of
ahair
would
have
induced
him
to
plunge
the
weapon
,
at
all
risks
,
intothe
heart
of
Britton
,
but
the
latter
seeing
the
Honourable
GeorgianaBrereton
,
who
he
supposed
had
been
so
civil
to
him
,
about
to
depart
,
made
a
sudden
rush
forward
,
and
before
any
one
could
be
aware
of
hisintentions
<EOS>
,
he
clasped
her
round
the
waist
with
one
arm
,
and
commenceddragging
her
along
in
a
wild
dance
,
entirely
of
his
own
invention
.
<EOS>
Ageneral
rush
now
took
place
to
rescue
the
shrieking
female
,
and
a
sceneensued
of
the
greatest
confusion.—Britton
grew
absolutely
furious
,
and
dealt
blows
and
oaths
about
himwith
equal
liberality
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
all
this
Learmont
was
in
a
stateof
mind
bordering
on
distraction
.
<EOS>
He
rushed
into
the
midst
of
thethrong
,
and
seizing
Britton
by
the
throat
,
tore
him
from
among
theguests
,
nor
relaxed
his
hold
till
he
had
dragged
him
through
the
outersaloon
,
and
flung
him
into
a
small
ante
-
room
,
the
door
of
which
helocked
and
placed
the
key
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
Partly
with
the
fumes
of
whathe
had
drunk
,
and
partly
with
the
heavy
fall
<EOS>
Learmont
had
given
him
,
the
smith
dropped
into
a
lethargic
state
of
half
insensibility
and
halfsleep
,
so
that
at
all
events
he
was
for
a
time
quiet
in
the
room
wherehe
was
thrown
.
<EOS>
Dispirited
,
angry
,
and
his
apparel
disarranged
,
Learmont
returned
tohis
ball
-
room
.
<EOS>
His
guests
would
not
,
however
,
be
persuaded
to
remain
,
and
despite
all
his
protestations
that
the
“
madman
”
was
properlysecured
,
he
could
not
restore
the
confidence
or
hilarity
of
the
company
.
<EOS>
Upon
one
excuse
or
another
,
they
one
and
all
departed
,
and
not
a
singledance
took
place
in
the
elaborately
and
expensively
prepared
ball
-
roomof
the
ambitious
and
mortified
squire
.
<EOS>
With
a
forced
civility
he
saw
the
last
of
his
numerous
guests
to
hisdoor
.
<EOS>
The
lights
were
still
blazing
in
his
saloons
,
but
there
wassilence
and
loneliness
in
the
midst
of
all
his
splendour
,
which
nowlooked
such
a
mockery
of
gaiety
.
<EOS>
He
sunk
upon
a
chair
,
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
for
many
minutesin
an
agony
of
painful
reflection
.
<EOS>
Learmont
’s
first
grand
fête
was
over
,
and
a
signal
failure
.

CHAPTER
XXXVI.Albert
Seyton.—The
<EOS>
Lonely
Search.—A
Suggestion.—An
Important
Visit
.
<EOS>
We
will
now
conduct
the
reader
to
one
of
our
dramatis
personæ
that
wehave
unwillingly
been
compelled
to
neglect
for
some
time
—
we
mean
thegallant
and
enthusiastic
Albert
Seyton
.
<EOS>
As
we
have
recorded
theprostration
of
spirits
which
ensued
,
when
he
lost
all
trace
again
ofthe
unfortunate
and
persecuted
Ada
,
after
so
providentially
,
as
itwere
,
encountering
her
in
St.
James
’s
Park
,
terminated
in
a
long
anddangerous
illness
—
an
illness
which
brought
him
to
the
brink
of
thegrave
;
but
thanks
to
the
tender
nursing
of
his
father
,
and
an
excellentconstitution
,
he
successfully
battled
with
his
sickness
and
after
somemonths
,
was
able
,
although
but
the
shadow
of
his
former
self
,
to
walkabroad
,
by
the
assistance
of
his
father
.
<EOS>
His
deep
dejection
concerning
Ada
,
however
,
still
clung
to
him
like
ablight
,
and
it
became
clear
to
his
deeply
affected
father
that
heshould
never
again
see
the
bloom
of
health
upon
the
cheek
of
his
sonunless
<EOS>
the
hiding
-
place
of
the
deceitful
Jacob
Gray
was
once
morediscovered
.
<EOS>
The
old
house
at
Lambeth
had
been
soon
deserted
by
Tibbs
,
thebear
-
warden
.
<EOS>
The
gloom
and
solitariness
of
the
situation
by
no
meanssuited
the
habits
of
the
roving
vagabond
,
who
had
been
so
long
withouta
fixed
home
of
any
kind
,
that
now
he
had
become
possessed
of
one
,
suchas
<EOS>
it
was
,
he
soon
hated
it
,
and
looked
upon
it
in
the
light
of
aprison
.
<EOS>
All
that
Jacob
Gray
had
left
in
the
house
he
sold
off
and
oncemore
the
ruined
building
was
tenanted
only
by
the
rats
and
mice
whoscampered
along
its
deserted
rooms
and
echoing
corridors
.
<EOS>
Twice
Learmont
himself
had
visited
the
house
,
and
explored
every
nookand
corner
;
and
once
the
savage
smith
,
in
a
state
of
semi
-
intoxication
,
had
burst
open
the
door
,
and
rushed
from
room
to
room
in
the
vain
hopethat
Jacob
Gray
might
have
returned
to
his
hiding
-
place
.
<EOS>
After
that
it
was
the
haunt
of
any
desperate
character
who
chose
toenter
it
,
for
the
door
swung
loosely
by
one
hinge
,
and
the
winter’swind
,
hail
,
and
sleet
,
found
free
entrance
to
the
crazy
building
.
<EOS>
Albert
’s
father
,
too
,
had
been
often
,
and
lingered
about
the
ruinedstreet
,
until
he
could
no
longer
cherish
the
remotest
hope
of
beingenabled
to
find
a
clue
to
the
place
of
confinement
of
the
beautifulgirl
,
with
whose
weal
or
woe
the
happiness
or
sorrow
of
his
dear
sonwas
so
much
mixed
up
.
<EOS>
Then
he
besought
Albert
to
be
patient
,
and
trust
in
Heaven
to
sendsuccour
to
her
whom
he
loved
;
and
when
Albert
himself
could
walk
sofar
,
he
went
with
his
father
to
the
old
house
,
and
wandered
for
hoursfrom
room
to
room
,
pleasing
himself
with
the
thought
that
he
wastreading
upon
the
spots
oft
trodden
by
Ada
,
and
looking
upon
theobjects
most
familiar
to
her
eye
.
<EOS>
The
situation
of
secretary
to
Learmont
,
which
Albert
Seyton
,
littledreaming
how
closely
he
was
connected
with
the
fate
of
Ada
,
hadendeavoured
to
obtain
was
filled
up
long
before
he
was
convalescent
,
and
the
state
of
health
of
the
unhappy
youth
gave
his
father
far
moreuneasiness
than
any
consideration
of
his
present
prosperity
in
life
.
<EOS>
Daily
,
however
,
the
strength
of
Albert
returned
,
and
once
again
hecommenced
the
search
throughout
London
and
its
suburbs
for
the
lostAda
.
<EOS>
When
wearied
with
some
long
perambulation
,
he
would
bend
his
stepsto
the
Park
,
and
sit
in
melancholy
thought
upon
the
same
seat
on
whichhe
had
been
sitting
when
he
heard
the
voice
of
Ada
.
<EOS>
There
,
chewing
thecud
“
of
sweet
and
bitter
fancy
,
”
he
would
recline
for
hours
,
endeavouring
to
devise
fresh
schemes
for
the
discovery
of
Ada
,
andtrying
to
recollect
some
part
of
the
city
that
he
had
omitted
to
visit
.
<EOS>
He
would
then
wander
homewards
,
listless
,
dispirited
,
and
fatigued
,
torelate
to
his
father
the
particulars
and
non
-
success
of
his
toils
.
<EOS>
It
was
upon
one
of
these
occasions
that
poor
Albert
was
more
thanusually
dispirited
and
weary
,
that
his
father
said
kindly
to
him,—“Albert
,
it
does
appear
to
me
that
we
can
have
no
further
scruple
howwe
commit
this
man
Gray
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
be
the
father
of
the
persecuted
Ada
.
<EOS>
”“He
<EOS>
her
father
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Albert
.
<EOS>
“
I
would
as
leave
think
that
thetiger
could
be
sire
to
the
lamb
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
no
!
<EOS>
There
is
some
dark
,
mysteriousvillany
at
the
bottom
of
all
.
<EOS>
My
poor
Ada
is
the
innocent
victim
ofsome
intrigues
and
enemies
,
with
which
this
Gray
and
Britton
are
mixedup
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
The
villains
may
have
killed
her
.
<EOS>
Oh
I
would
that
kindHeaven
would
direct
me
where
to
seek
her!”“Do
not
despair
,
Albert
,
”
said
his
rather
soothingly
,
“
the
time
willcome
when
all
this
must
be
made
clear
and
apparent
.
<EOS>
”“I
hope
it
may
,
father
,
”
said
Albert
,
despondingly
,
“
<EOS>
but
I
am
verywretched
.
<EOS>
”“It
<EOS>
strikes
me
,
”
continued
Mr.
Seyton
,
“
that
we
are
not
justified
,
Albert
,
in
the
course
we
are
pursuing
.
”“Indeed
!
<EOS>
Father
.
<EOS>
”“No
,
Albert
.
<EOS>
What
I
advise
is
an
immediate
communication
of
the
wholeof
the
circumstances
to
the
magistrate
,
Sir
Frederick
Hartleton
.
<EOS>
Thefact
that
a
mysterious
packet
was
actually
addressed
to
him
,
and
setsuch
a
store
by
this
man
Gray
,
will
be
sufficient
to
interest
him
inthe
case
.
<EOS>
”Albert
remained
in
thought
for
a
few
moments
,
and
then
springing
fromhis
seat
with
energy
,
he
exclaimed,—“Yes
,
father
,
let
us
do
so
.
<EOS>
There
is
hope
in
that
.
<EOS>
Sir
FrederickHartleton
must
have
means
of
inquiry
,
and
sources
of
information
thatno
one
but
a
person
in
his
situation
could
have
.
<EOS>
Let
us
go
at
once
.
<EOS>
”“You
are
wearied
now
,
Albert
.
<EOS>
”“No
<EOS>
,
no
<EOS>
;
I
am
never
wearied
in
the
cause
of
Ada
.
<EOS>
”“Wait
till
you
are
invigorated
;
you
can
then
tell
your
fate
better
,
forin
truth
<EOS>
you
must
know
a
great
deal
more
than
I.”“Oh
father
,
come
with
me
now
.
<EOS>
You
have
made
this
suggestion
,
and
it
maybe
a
most
happy
one
.
<EOS>
Come
now!”“I
will
not
baulk
you
,
”
said
Mr.
Seyton
,
rising
,
“
I
do
not
think
it
aproper
course
;
but
do
not
build
too
much
upon
it
,
Albert
:
<EOS>
only
lookupon
it
as
a
chance
that
should
not
be
thrown
away

”Sir
<EOS>
Frederick
Hartleton
<EOS>
’s
<EOS>
office
was
across
the
Park
,
somewhere
closeabout
the
spot
now
occupied
by
the
gardens

Buckingham

,
andSeyton
lived
in
the
neighbourhood

;
so
that
the
father
and
sonproceeded
to
Charing

entered
the

by
the
gate
in
SpringGardens

Albert

careless
throng
theypassed
among
;
their
thoughts
were
intent
upon
the
object
of
theirsearch
,
although
it
was
with
a
sigh
that
the
elder
Seyton
marked
thehopeful
countenance
and
tone
of
his
son
;
for
he
himself
had
been
usedto
disappointment
,
and
expected
but
little
from
the
visit
to
themagistrate
.
<EOS>
It
grieved
him
therefore
to
think
that
Albert
should
hopemuch
from
the
application
,
because
he
knew
that
his
disappointment
,
should
it
result
in
nothing
,
would
be
proportionately
great
.
<EOS>
“Albert
,
”
he
said
,
“
this
step
I
consider
more
a
matter
of
public
dutythan
anything
else
.
<EOS>
We
must
still
trust
to
Providence
to
protect
Ada
,
only
we
place
ourselves
in
a
little
better
position
by
the
co
-
operationof
a
magistrate
so
much
respected
and
esteemed
as
Sir
FrederickHartleton
,
in
what
we
do
.
<EOS>
”“He
may
find
me
,
my
Ada
,
”
said
Albert
,
“
<EOS>
and
so
entitle
himself
to
agratitude
from
me
that
shall
be
boundless
.
<EOS>
”“You
had
better
let
me
tell
the
tale
,
”
said
his
father
,
noticing
theagitated
spirits
of
Albert—“should
<EOS>
I
omit
anything
,
you
can
put
meright
Albert
.
<EOS>
”“As
<EOS>
you
please
,
father
,
”
he
replied
,
“
I
am
too
much
agitated
to
speakwhat
I
know

<EOS>
”“Your
sincerity
will
be
the
most
apparent
to
Sir
Frederick
by
theemotion
you
can
not
subdue

Albert

<EOS>
All
men
,
but
those
who
areevil

doers
,
or
live
on
the
fruits
of
crime
,
speak
well
of
thisgentleman
,
as
an
upright
magistrate
and
a
feeling
man
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
had
now
crossed
the
park
and
emerged
at
the
little
,
gate
leading
toPimlico
.
<EOS>
They
then
inquired
for
the
office
of
Sir
Frederick
,
and
weredirected
down
a
narrow
street
,
called
Buckingham
-
place
,
which
was
butdimly
lighted
by
the
inefficient
oil
lamps
of
the
period
.
<EOS>
Over
an
open
doorway
was
a
lamp
,
with
the
words
“
Magistrate
’s
Office,”boldly
enamelled
upon
the
dirty
glass
.
<EOS>
“This
must
be
the
place
,
father
,
”
said
Albert
,
hurriedly
.
<EOS>
“No
<EOS>
doubt
,
”
replied
Seyton
.
<EOS>
“
Come
in
,
Albert
.
<EOS>
”They
stooped
under
the
low
arched
doorway
,
and
were
immediatelyconfronted
by
a
man
of
coarse
heavy
build
,
who
demanded
to
know
theirbusiness
.
<EOS>
“We
<EOS>
have
a
private
communication
to
make
to
Sir
Frederick
,
”
said
Mr
.
Seyton
.
<EOS>
“Oh
,
private
?
”
<EOS>
muttered
the
man
.
<EOS>
“Yes
,
strictly
private
.
<EOS>
”“Is
<EOS>
it
anything
about
Bill
<EOS>
Soames?”“Bill
who?”“Bill
Soames
—
he
’s
nabbed
for
robbing
the
Bishop
of
Ely
,
crossing
theopen
waste
opposite
Tyburn
Gate
.
<EOS>
”“No
,
its
quite
private
business
of
another
kind

”
said
Mr.
Seyton
.
<EOS>
“There
is
my
card

my

<EOS>
Please
to
tell
Sir

<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
man
took
the
card
and
passed
through
a
doorway
,
growling
as
he
went
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
moments
he
returned
,
and
taking
a
key
from
a
bunch
at
hisgirdles
he
opened
a
door
at
the
further
end
of
the
passage
,
at
the
sametime
saying,—“This
way

<EOS>
”Albert
<EOS>
and
his
father
stepped
forward
after
their
guide
.
<EOS>
In
a
momentanother
door
opened
,
from
which
issued
a
stream
of
light
,
and
theyfound
themselves
in
the
presence
of
Sir
Frederick
Hartleton
,
themagistrate
,
the
terror
of
highwaymen
;
several
of
whom
he
had
himselfcaptured
on
Hounslow
and
Barnes
’
Commons
.
<EOS>
He
rose
courteously
on
the
entrance
of
the
Seytons
,
and
invited
them
tobe
seated
.
<EOS>
Before
they
could
speak
,
he
said
rapidly,—“Gentlemen
<EOS>
,
I
trust
you
will
not
take
any
offence
at
my
saying
that
mytime
is
very
much
occupied

begging
you
to
be
brief

<EOS>
”“The
time

”
said
Mr.
Seyton
,
“
should
never
beheedlessly
wasted

<EOS>
Do
you
know
a
man
named
Gray?”“Gray
—
Gray
?
”
<EOS>
repeated
Sir
Frederick
Hartleton
.
<EOS>
“
No
,
sir
,
I
do
not
.
<EOS>
”“There
<EOS>
exists
,
however
,
a
man
of
that
name
,
who
,
without
authority
,
keeps
prisoner
a
young
girl
,
if
he
has
not
destroyed
her

”“Where
<EOS>
is
he?”“That

sir

we
do
not

”“Where
<EOS>
is

equally
ignorant

<EOS>
”“What

’s
her

<EOS>
”“Ada
<EOS>
what?”“I
know
not

sir

<EOS>
”“You
do
not
bring
me
many
particulars

said
the
magistrate
.
<EOS>
“
What
doyou
wish
me
to
do?”“In
<EOS>
this
man
Gray

possession

sir
<EOS>

added
Mr.
Seyton
,
“
is
a

carefully
addressed
to
you

<EOS>
”“Indeed!”“Yes

and
with
a
superscription
attached

that

only

forwardedto
you
,
should
he
,
Gray
,
be
absent
from
home
without
note
or
messagefor
a
certain
time
.
<EOS>
”“Then
<EOS>
you
may
depend
that
this
Mr.
Gray
has
found
his
way
home
in
goodtime
,
for
I
have
received
no
such
packet

<EOS>
”“We
<EOS>
,
”
continued
Mr.
Seyton
,
“
from
once
living
in
the
same
house
withher

have
warmly
interested
ourselves
in
the
fate
of
the

who
isas
virtuous
and
amiable
as
she
is
beautiful
.
”“Is
<EOS>
this
Gray
in
London?”“We
believe
he
is

<EOS>
He
has
twice
shifted
his
residence
,
to
ensure
thebetter
concealment
of
the

”“There
<EOS>
is
most
probably
<EOS>
some
crime
at
the
bottom
of
this
business,”said
Sir
Frederick
;
“
but
I
can
not
help
you

<EOS>
If
you
can
find
the

Iwill
of
course
grant
a
warrant
to
bring
Gray
here
,
for
keeping
her
aprisoner
without

<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
you
had
better
tell
me
theminutest
particulars
as
rapidly
as
you
conveniently
can
.
”Mr

<EOS>
Seyton
then
related
all
that
he
knew
of
Ada
and
Gray
,
comprisingwhat
he
had
gathered
from
Albert
,
and
comprehending
the
meeting
in
thepark
,
and
the
particulars
which
Ada
had
related
of
the
midnight
attackupon
<EOS>
Gray

.
<EOS>
“What
names
were
mentioned
accidentally
or
otherwise
,
during
all
thisbusiness?”“But
two
,
sir
,
”
said
Albert
.
<EOS>
“
Ada
told
me
in
the
park
that
one
of
themen
who
sought
the
life
of
Gray
was
called
by
him
Britton!”“Britton

”
said
Sir
Frederick
.
<EOS>
“
Are
you
quite
sure
that
was
the
name?”“Quite
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
do
know
that
name!”“You

you

”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Albert
,
with
sudden
animation—“Then
<EOS>
youwill
save
her!”“Oh
—
you
are
in
love
with
this
imprisoned
young
lady
,
”
said
SirFrederick
,
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
Albert
drew
back
,
abashed
.
<EOS>
“Nay
<EOS>
my
young
friend
,
”
the
magistrate
added
,
“
you
need
not
be
ashamedof
an
honest
attachment
,
which
,
in
the
case
of
this
persecuted

must
be
disinterested
.
<EOS>
”“You
know
Britton
,
sir
?
”
<EOS>
said
Albert
,
confused
.
<EOS>
“I
know
a
person
of
that
name

in
fact
,
I
am
watching

”“There
<EOS>
was
another
name
too
mentioned

”
said
Albert
,
“
it
was
that
of
apoor
maniac
called
Mad
Maud

<EOS>
She
seemed
to
know
this
Britton
.
<EOS>
”“She
has
cause
to
know
him

”
remarked
Sir
Frederick
Hartleton
.
<EOS>
“Stay
<EOS>
—
I—”The
magistrate
paused
,
and
it
was
evident
that
something
had
crossedhis
mind
of
an
important
nature
.
<EOS>
He
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hand
,
andseemed
to
be
musing
over
some
train
of
circumstances
in
his
mind
thatwanted
some
connecting
links
.
<EOS>
“Be
<EOS>
so
good
,
”
he
said
,
suddenly
,
“
as
to
answer
me
as
exactly
as
youcan
,
what
I
shall
ask
of
you
.
<EOS>
”“We
<EOS>
will
,
sir
,
”
said
Mr.
Seyton
.
<EOS>
“What
kind
of
man
is
this
Gray?”“He
is
rather
above
the
middle
height
,
of
spare
habit
,
and
very
pale
.
<EOS>
”“His
<EOS>
eyes?”“Shifting
and
inconstant
—
looking
here

there
,
and
everywhere
,
but
<EOS>
inthe
face
of
any
one
he
addresses
.
<EOS>
”“You
never
saw
Britton?”“Never

<EOS>
”“Now
tell
me
as
nearly
as
you
can
the
age
of
this
young
girl
you
callAda?”“She
can
not
now
be
above
seventeen
,
”
said
Albert
.
<EOS>
“Seventeen?”The
magistrate
took
a
scrap
of
paper
,
and
made
some
slight
calculationsin
figures
upon
it
—
then
he
said,—“During
all
this
business
,
did
you
never
hear
another
name
mentioned
asa
prime
mover
or
important
personage
,
connected
with
it?”“No

”
said
Albert
,
“
those
were
all
.
<EOS>
”“Well
<EOS>
,
gentlemen

”
remarked
Sir
Frederick
;
“
you
have
said
enough

<EOS>
Pray
come
here
again
this
day

purpose

good

Youmay
depend

solve

mystery

which
thisaffair
is
at

so
strangely
enveloped

<EOS>
”Albert
<EOS>
and
his
father
returned
their
warm
acknowledgments
to
themagistrate
;
and
,
leaving
their
address

,
they
were
escorted
through

CHAPTER
<EOS>
XXXVII.The
<EOS>
Pursuit.—The
<EOS>
Attempted
Murder.—A
Providential
Interference.—ThePapers
.
<EOS>
For
some
moments
after
the
departure
of
his
visitors
,
Sir
FrederickHartleton
remained
in
deep
thought
,
then
he
commenced
a
diligent
searchamong
some
memoranda
that
he
took
from
an
iron
chest
imbedded
in
thewall
,
and
,
selecting
one
paper
,
perused
it
attentively
more
than
once
.
<EOS>
“Surely
,
”
he
suddenly
exclaimed
,
“
this
is
the
clue
at
last
.
<EOS>
Well
do
Iremember
the
awful
night
at
Learmont
,
when
the
storm
spread
confusionand
dismay
among
the
peasantry
,
and
Britton
’s
ill
-
omened
house
was
inflames
,
while
the
dreadful
cries
that
even
now
seem
to
ring
in
my
ears
,
so
forcibly
does
memory
recall
them
,
issued
from
the
burning
mass
.
<EOS>
Letme
see
.
<EOS>
The
time
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
that
is
sufficiently
near,—between
fourteen
andfifteen
-
years
since
.
<EOS>
Learmont
in
London
,
and
Britton
,
the
smith
,
livingnear
him
?
<EOS>
In
a
style
of
coarse
extravagance
and
debauchery
befittinghis
coarse
nature
.
<EOS>
Who
supplied
the
funds?—Why
the
rich
ambitiousmoney
-
loving
Squire
Learmont
,
to
be
sure
!
<EOS>
And
wherefore?—Aye
,
that’sthe
question
.
<EOS>
For
one
of
two
reasons
,
I
’ll
swear
.
<EOS>
Either
as
a
rewardfor
present
services
,
or
to
purchase
silence
for
the
past
.
<EOS>
Humph!Learmont
is
by
no
means
scrupulous
.
<EOS>
He
would
murder
the
smith
.
<EOS>
Aysurely
would
he
.
<EOS>
There
is
something
then
in
progress
which
makesBritton
’s
life
valuable
to
the
squire
.
<EOS>
And
this
man
,
Gray
,
too
.
<EOS>
Who
ishe
?
<EOS>
Was
he
the
man
who
rushed
with
such
frantic
gestures
from
the
firewith
the
child
in
his
arms
?
<EOS>
And
is
that
child
,
this
girl
—
<EOS>
this
Ada
,
asthey
call
her?—Surely
the
whole
fits
well
together
.
<EOS>
But
still
there
isno
proof
—
all
is
circumstantial
as
yet
,
and
involved
in
mere
conjecture
.
<EOS>
Squire
Learmont
may
maintain
Britton
if
he
please
,
and
who
shallquestion
him?”Sir
Frederick
now
again
remained
in
silent
thought
for
a
long
time
,
then
he
said
in
an
assured
voice,—“I
must
trust
this
affair
to
no
one
.
<EOS>
It
is
too
intricate
for
anyordinary
scouts
to
trace
.
<EOS>
I
must
see
to
it
myself
.
<EOS>
The
smith
,
I
amaware
,
holds
his
drunken
orgies
at
the
Chequers
.
<EOS>
Thither
I
will
myselfgo
,
and
watch
him
.
<EOS>
Squire
Learmont
,
the
time
will
come
when
the
crimesthat
<EOS>
I
suspect
you
of
may
be
made
apparent
;
but
cunning
devil
that
youare
,
I
must
be
cautious
or
I
shall
alarm
you
,
and
defeat
myself
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
magistrate
now
rose
,
and
disrobing
himself
of
his
upper
clothings
,
took
from
a
cloth
-
press
in
his
room
the
apparel
in
which
he
afterwardsappeared
at
the
Chequers
,
where
the
little
scene
occurred
between
himand
the
smith
,
Britton
,
of
which
the
reader
is
already
cognisant
.
<EOS>
We
will
now
,
therefore
,
fellow
the
proceedings
of
Sir
FrederickHartleton
after
he
left
the
Chequers
.
<EOS>
His
object
was
to
procure
poorMaud
,
and
get
from
her
as
much
information
as
he
thought
he
might
,
bycomparing
with
what
he
himself
knew
,
rely
upon
.
<EOS>
He
walked
very
quickly
down
the
street
;
but
the
object
of
his
searchwas
nowhere
to
be
seen
,
and
he
felt
convinced
that
she
must
have
gonein
the
opposite
direction
,
although
he
felt
almost
sure
likewise
thathe
had
noticed
a
figure
somewhat
resembling
hers
in
the
way
he
wasproceeding
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
standing
in
a
state
of
doubt
,
the
smith
reeledpast
him
,
and
,
Sir
Frederick
stepping
into
the
shadow
of
a
doorway
,
escaped
recognition
from
the
drunken
and
infuriated
man
.
<EOS>
He
then
resolved
to
follow
him
,
to
see
whither
he
went
,
as
Mad
Maud
hecould
easily
discover
by
his
police
agents
on
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
Dogging
,
therefore
,
the
unequal
footsteps
of
Britton
,
the
disguisedmagistrate
followed
him
closely
and
safely
.
<EOS>
The
smith
paused
at
the
corner
of
the
street
,
and
asked
a
drowsywatchman
if
he
had
seen
a
beggar
woman
pass
.
<EOS>
He
was
at
once
answered
inthe
affirmative
,
and
in
the
same
breath
asked
for
something
to
drink
,
which
Britton
,
being
at
the
same
time
more
savage
than
hospitable
,
refused
with
the
addition
of
a
curse
.
<EOS>
Sir
Frederick
now
congratulated
himself
upon
following
the
smith
;
forhe
doubted
not
that
,
should
he
encounter
poor
Maud
<EOS>
,
he
would
inflictupon
her
some
fatal
injury
,
unless
he
,
Sir
Frederick
,
was
at
hand
toprotect
the
poor
creature
.
<EOS>
Britton
blundered
on
,
cursing
and
muttering
to
himself
,
but
in
so
low
atone
that
,
although
the
magistrate
came
as
close
to
him
as
he
couldwith
safety
,
he
could
not
shape
any
intelligible
phrases
from
what
wasthus
uttered
.
<EOS>
Britton
walked
on
in
the
direction
of
the
Houses
of
Parliament
andWestminster
Hall
,
still
very
closely
followed
,
and
almost
everypassenger
he
met
<EOS>
he
asked
if
a
beggar
woman
had
been
seen
.
<EOS>
Someanswered
one
thing
and
some
another
,
until
a
lad
affirmed
that
an
oldbeggar
woman
passed
him
near
to
Millbank
,
and
then
sat
down
on
adoor
-
step
nearly
facing
the
river
.
<EOS>
With
a
shout
of
triumph
Britton
rushed
onwards
;
but
Sir
Frederick
keptas
close
as
prudence
would
dictate
,
until
they
cleared
Abingdon
-
street
,
and
came
upon
the
then
dark
and
straggling
purlieus
of
Millbank
.
<EOS>
There
were
but
few
lights
in
this
quarter
,
and
the
inhabitants
were
notvery
favourably
known
to
the
magistrate
as
the
most
moral
race
inLondon
.
<EOS>
Britton
now
proceeded
more
cautiously
,
and
kept
peering
about
him
toendeavour
,
as
it
appeared
to
Sir
Frederick
,
as
well
to
discover
Maud
asto
note
if
any
one
was
near
.
<EOS>
By
gliding
along
close
to
some
blackpalings
the
magistrate
entirely
escaped
observation
,
and
Britton
seemedsatisfied
that
he
was
alone
.
<EOS>
Close
to
the
river
was
a
low
wall
of
<EOS>
not
more
than
four
feet
high
,
andthe
night
was
so
dark
that
it
could
scarcely
be
distinguished
from
thedark
stream
that
rolled
by
on
the
further
side
of
it
.
<EOS>
Directly
over
thewall
was
a
kind
of
parapet
of
about
three
feet
in
width
,
which
wasabout
level
with
the
decks
of
the
small
river
craft
that
came
todisengage
gravel
,
wood
,
logs
,
&
c.
,
at
the
wharfs
,
and
was
veryconvenient
for
them
.
<EOS>
Immediately
,
however
,
below
this
parapet
,
and
,
infact
,
partly
washing
under
it
,
was
the
black
muddy
tide
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
Dark
as
was
the
water
,
the
wall
was
still
darker
,
and
Sir
FrederickHartleton
could
plainly
see
the
upper
part
of
the
bulky
form
of
thesmith
in
slight
relief
against
the
water
,
as
he
walked
slowly
alongclose
to
the
wall
.
<EOS>
Once
or
twice
he
looked
back
;
but
his
pursuer
was
on
the
other
side
ofthe
way
,
and
quite
well
backed
by
the
black
paling
which
,
when
hestooped
a
very
little
,
was
above
his
head
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
state
of
things
,
when
suddenly
a
wild
plaintive
voicebroke
the
stillness
of
the
night
air
;
and
,
with
a
mockery
of
gaiety
,
that
had
in
it
the
very
soul
of
pathos
,
sang
or
rather
chaunted
thewords
of
a
song
of
joy
,
hope
,
and
mirth
,
which
was
then
popular
in
themetropolis
,
and
was
the
composition
of
one
of
the
most
distinguishedwits
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
wild
abandonment
of
manner
about
the
singer
,
that
wouldhave
commanded
the
attention
of
Sir
Frederick
at
any
time
;
but
now
thathe
saw
the
smith
suddenly
pause
,
he
paused
likewise
,
and
the
strainswith
all
their
melancholy
pathos
came
full
upon
his
ear
.
<EOS>
To
the
Bride
!
<EOS>
To
the
Bride!“To
the
Bride
!
<EOS>
To
the
Bride
,
I
sing
,
And
away
to
the
winds
the
strainI
fling
.
<EOS>
There
’s
a
tear
in
her
gentle
eye
,
I
trow
—
<EOS>
She
weeps
,
and
her
heart
is
sad
,
I
vow;Her
hand
like
a
leaflet
<EOS>
shakesI
see,—That
hand
which
never
moreIs
free
.
<EOS>
She
leaves
her
happy
homeOf
light
,
Where
her
happiest
days
were
pastSo
bright
:
<EOS>
She
has
trusted
all
to
one
,
The
bride
.
<EOS>
Shall
her
young
heart
’s
joy
e’er
knowA
tide
—
Shall
her
bliss
flow
on
for
ayeOr
not?When
distant
far
,
shall
everThe
spot
,
Where
she
lived
and
loved
so
long
,
Be
forgot?To
the
Bride
!
<EOS>
To
the
Bride
,
I
sing
,
And
away
to
the
winds
my
strainI
fling!”The
voice
ceased
.
<EOS>
A
solemn
stillness
reigned
for
a
few
brief
seconds
,
and
then
Sir
Frederick
saw
the
shadowy
form
of
the
smith
glideforwards
—
the
gruff
voice
of
the
savage
drunkard
came
to
his
ears
as
hestooped
and
exclaimed,—“So
Maud
—
we
have
met
again
.
<EOS>
D
—
<EOS>
n
<EOS>
you
,
we
are
alone
<EOS>
now!”A
half
-
stifled
scream
followed
that
speech
,
and
the
magistrate
boundedacross
the
road
.
<EOS>
He
paused
,
however
,
when
he
was
within
a
few
paces
ofBritton
,
for
he
heard
the
poor
mad
creature
speak
,
and
the
thoughtcrossed
his
mind
that
her
cry
had
proceeded
from
sudden
surprise
,
andnot
from
any
injury
inflicted
by
the
smith
,
and
knowing
his
power
<EOS>
tosave
her
<EOS>
he
thought
that
if
Britton
wished
to
procure
any
informationfrom
Mad
Maud
previous
to
offering
her
any
violence
,
he
might
as
wellhear
it
,
as
in
all
probability
it
would
be
important
and
correct
.
<EOS>
Acting
on
this
supposition
,
he
crouched
down
close
by
the
wall
for
somefew
seconds
—
then
suddenly
recollecting
the
parapet
on
the
other
side
,
and
the
facilities
it
afforded
as
sufficiently
close
to
aid
poor
Maudin
case
of
the
most
sudden
emergency
,
he
crept
softly
twenty
yards
ormore
away
,
and
then
clambered
over
the
wall
in
a
moment
,
on
to
theparapet
.
<EOS>
To
draw
himself
along
this
noiselessly
until
he
actually
facedBritton
,
was
the
work
but
of
another
minute
,
and
laying
flat
down
wasquite
secure
from
observation
,
while
he
was
ready
for
action
,
and
musthear
the
slightest
murmured
word
that
passed
.

“What

”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Britton
,
as
Sir
Frederick
Hamilton
haltedon
the
parapet
.
<EOS>
“
Speak

Maud

by

I
’ll

<EOS>
replied
Maud
;
“
I

<EOS>
Ay

Yes

<EOS>
muttered
Britton

<EOS>
“
Tell

—
did

<EOS>
repeated
Maud
.
<EOS>
“
Oh

before

”“Answer

<EOS>
cried
Britton

fiercely
,
“
did

bring

said
Maud
,
“

<EOS>
Why
does
not
my

come
to
his

do
you
mean?”“We
waited
for
him
,
but
he
came
not
;
then
they
whispered
he
wasdead
—
yes

dead

and
I
asked
Heaven
who
had
killed
him

when
a
voicewhispered
—

cried
Britton

<EOS>
“
You

<EOS>
”“Yes

<EOS>

said
Maud
;
“

not

<EOS>
There

started
and
involuntarily
glanced
at
his
hands
.
<EOS>
“Ay

cried
Maud
;
“
you

cried
Britton

”Britton
was
silent
for
a
moment

<EOS>
He
was
hesitating
whether
by
violence

at
once
,
to
tear
the
paper
from
the
poor
wandering
creature
,
orendeavour
first
to
procure
such

<EOS>
He
decided
on
the
latter
course

as
violence
could
beresorted
to
at
any

<EOS>
“Maud

”
he
said
,
“
when
did

she
replied

<EOS>
“
I
recollect
there
were
many

noneso

They
held

“Curses

Britton

the

shivering
form
with
tongues
of
flame!”“Peace
,
wretch
,
”
cried
Britton
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
moment
he
lifted
his
arm
,
and
in
his
hand
gleamed
a
knife
.
<EOS>
“Hold
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Maud
,
<EOS>
“
you
dare
not!”Sir
<EOS>
Frederick
Hartleton
raised
his
hand
.
<EOS>
Britton
slowly
dropped
hismurdering
arm
.
<EOS>
“Woman
<EOS>
,
”
he
said
,
“
do
you
wish
for
death
,
that
you
tempt
me
thus
tokill
<EOS>
you?”There
was
a
trembling
fear
in
Britton
’s
voice
that
re
-
assured
SirFrederick
;
and
,
congratulating
himself
that
the
sudden
movement
he
had
,
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
,
made
,
had
escaped
observation
,
he
againlay
perfectly
quiet
,
but
prepared
to
aid
poor
Maud
upon
an
emergency
.
<EOS>
“Maud
,
”
said
Britton
,
after
a
pause
,
“
give
me
the
paper
you
have
!
<EOS>
Andleave
London
.
”“Leave
<EOS>
you
,
”
said
Maud
,
“
I
dare
not
;
I
have
a
duty
to

<EOS>
is

<EOS>
Wherever

Andrew

there
will
you

<EOS>
No

<EOS>
I
can
not

I
sometimes

I

dead

and
that
thereis
<EOS>
my

haunting
you

<EOS>
”“We
<EOS>
shall
see

”
muttered
Britton
;
“
spirits
have
never
troubled
me
yet
.
<EOS>
The

,
I
say!—The
paper
that
you
set
such
store
by
!
<EOS>
I
must
and
willhave
it
.
<EOS>
”“Never!”“Then
take
the
consequences
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
again
raised
his
knife
,
and
was
in
the
very
act
of
bringing
it
downto
plunge
it
into
the
breast
of
the
hapless
creature
,
when
his
eyesfell
upon
the
form
of
Sir
Frederick
Hartleton
,
who
rose
up
on
theparapet
between
him
and
the
water
.
<EOS>
This
sudden
appearance
,
rising
apparently
from
out
of
the
river
,
hadall
the
effect
which
Sir
Frederick
expected
it
would
.
<EOS>
Britton
,
for
thefirst
time
in
his
life
,
was
affected
by
superstition
.
<EOS>
He
could
,
on
thespur
of
the
moment
,
imagine
the
tall
dusky
form
that
thus
rose
beforehis
very
eyes
,
and
,
as
it
were
,
from
the
bosom
of
the
Thames
,
to
be
noother
than
some
supernatural
being
interposing
between
him
and
hisvictim
.
<EOS>
He
started
back
in
horror
,
then
,
dropping
the
knife
,
he
rushedprecipitately
from
the
spot
.
<EOS>
Maud
burst
into
a
wild
laugh
,
and
before
Sir
Frederick
Hartleton
couldspeak
a
word
to
detain
her
,
she
fled
in
a
contrary
direction
to
thatwhich
Britton
had
taken
,
with
great
speed
.
<EOS>
Hastily
springing
over
the
wall
,
Sir
Frederick
,
as
well
as
he
was
ableby
the
dim
light
,
pursued
the
flying
woman
,
his
object
being
the
sameas
<EOS>
Britton
’s
,
namely
,
to
possess
himself
of
the
paper
in
Maud’spossession
,
and
which
,
he
doubted
not
,
was
in
some
way
near
or
remotelyconnected
with
the
chain
of
mysteries
that
enveloped
the
crimes
ofSquire
Learmont
and
his
associates
in
guilt
,
the
savage
smith
and
theman
named
as
Gray
.
<EOS>
Now
and
then
he
could
see
the
flutter
of
her
garments
as
she
rushedalong
by
the
wall
;
and
as
often
as
he
did
,
he
redoubled
his
speed
withthe
hope
of
overtaking
,
while
she
was
compelled
,
from
the
nature
of
theground
,
to
go
forward
in
nearly
a
straight
line
;
for
he
well
knew
thatafter
passing
the
river
wall
,
which
did
not
extend
much
further
fromthe
broken
nature
of
the
open
country
,
and
several
hedges
andplantations
that
were
close
at
hand
,
he
might
be
completely
foiled
tilldaylight
in
his
attempt
to
follow
the
poor
creature
,
who
most
probablyfancied
she
was
flying
from
Britton
.
<EOS>
“Maud
!
<EOS>
Maud
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Sir
Frederick
Hartleton
,
with
the
hope
that
shewould
recognise
that
his
voice
was
not
that
of
the
savage
smith
.
<EOS>
His
call
,
however
,
seemed
to
alarm
her
still
more
,
and
,
in
fact
,
notwithstanding
her
wild
and
superstitious
confidence
in
theprobability
of
her
outliving
the
smith
,
the
fear
of
death
from
hisruffianly
hands
had
come
strongly
upon
her
,
and
she
fled
,
shriekingfrom
the
magistrate
,
with
the
full
confidence
that
Britton
was
pursuingher
,
armed
with
the
knife
she
had
seen
gleaming
for
an
instant
aboveher
devoted
head
.
<EOS>
Her
fleetness
astonished
Sir
Frederick
Hartleton
,
forswift
runner
as
he
was
,
he
could
not
come
up
with
her
.
<EOS>
“Maud
!
”
<EOS>
he
cried
again
,
and
the
poor
creature
answered
him
by
a
scream
,
which
at
once
convinced
him
that
he
inspired
her
with
terror
,
ratherthan
confidence
,
by
calling
after
her
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
abstained
fromdoing
so
,
and
began
evidently
to
gain
upon
her
just
as
she
neared
thepart
of
the
river
’s
bank
where
the
low
wall
terminated
.
<EOS>
Now
she
looked
back
and
screamed
again
,
as
she
saw
his
figure
dashingonwards
through
the
gloom
.
<EOS>
“I
am
a
friend
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Sir
Frederick
Hartleton
,
but
his
voice
was
weakfrom
the
violence
,
from
which
he
had
been
pursuing
Mad
Maud
,
and
sheheard
him
not
.
<EOS>
Now
she
reached
the
end
of
the
wall
,
and
looked
round
again.—A
cryannounced
her
terror
,
and
she
turned
toward
the
river
instead
of
theland
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
heavy
splash
,
and
as
he
heard
it
,
the
awful
conviction
cameacross
the
mind
of
the
magistrate
,
that
the
unhappy
creature
had
thrownherself
into
the
Thames
to
escape
him
.
<EOS>
He
gained
the
spot
in
an
instant
.
<EOS>
A
lighter
stood
moored
close
to
thebank
.
<EOS>
With
a
tremendous
spring
Sir
Frederick
gained
the
deck
,
andleaning
anxiously
over
the
side
,
he
gazed
earnestly
into
the
stream
asit
rippled
by
.
<EOS>
A
stifled
cry
met
his
ears
.
<EOS>
He
looked
in
the
directionfrom
whence
it
came
,
and
saw
a
dark
object
hurried
on
by
the
water
.
<EOS>
It
was
but
the
act
of
a
moment
to
dive
from
the
deck
of
the
lighter
,
and
in
the
next
the
athletic
Sir
Frederick
Hartleton
touched
the
bottomof
the
Thames
.
<EOS>
He
was
an
admirable
swimmer
,
and
rising
to
the
surface
,
just
as
thewatchmen
on
the
Surrey
side
began
to
spring
their
rattles
,
and
give
analarm
by
calling
out
that
some
one
had
fallen
in
the
river
.
<EOS>
Some
few
hundred
yards
in
advance
of
him
,
he
saw
the
dark
object
stillhurrying
on
.
<EOS>
Assisted
by
the
tide
,
and
his
own
vigorous
swimming
,
hesoon
neared
it
.
<EOS>
A
few
more
sweeps
of
his
arms
brought
him
within
arm’slength
,
and
he
grasped
poor
Maud
,
for
it
was
she
,
indeed
,
by
her
longraven
hair
which
had
escaped
from
its
confinement
,
and
floated
in
adark
mass
upon
the
surface
of
the
water
.
<EOS>
“Help
!
<EOS>
”
cried
Sir
Frederick
in
a
clear
voice
,
and
turning
towards
theSurrey
shore
,
which
was
now
much
nearer
to
him
than
that
from
which
hehad
come
.
<EOS>
Several
boats
had
now
pushed
off
,
and
in
one
a
man
stood
up
with
a
linkthat
cast
a
lurid
glare
over
the
stream
.
<EOS>
“Hilloa
!
”
cried
the
man
.
<EOS>
“
Who
’s
in
for
a
ducking
now
?
<EOS>
Hilloa
there
.
”“Hilloa
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Sir
Frederick
,
and
the
rowers
at
once
pulled
towardshim
.
<EOS>
“Back
water
!
”
<EOS>
cried
the
man
with
the
light—“I
<EOS>
see
him
—
here
ye
are
.
<EOS>
”The
magistrate
grasped
the
side
of
the
boat
,
and
said—“Now
,
my
lads
,
take
in
the
woman
.
<EOS>
”Maud
was
lifted
into
the
boat
,
and
Sir
Frederick
himself
clamberedafter
her
.
<EOS>
“Fifty
guineas
,
my
brave
fellows
,
”
he
cried
,
“
if
we
get
to
shore
intime
to
recover
this
poor
creature
.
<EOS>
”“Fif
—
fif
—
fifty
?
”
<EOS>
ejaculated
the
man
with
the
light
.
<EOS>
“Yes
—
fifty
guineas
.
<EOS>
”“Pull
,
you
devils
!
”
<EOS>
he
shrieked
out
to
the
rowers
.
<EOS>
“
Pull
—
pull
.
<EOS>
”The
men
bent
all
their
energies
to
the
task
,
and
in
less
than
threeminutes
more
the
keel
of
the
boat
grated
on
the
shore
.
<EOS>
Wet
and
cold
as
he
was
,
Sir
Frederick
Hartleton
seized
the
inanimateand
light
form
of
Maud
,
as
if
she
had
been
an
infant
,
and
springingfrom
the
boat
,
he
ran
to
a
public

house
called
“
The
King

Bounty,”that
was
celebrated
at
the
time
and
declaring

properly
attended

he
himself
ran
to
a

procured
his

to
restore

Anger.—A
Drunken
Tour

Determination
.
<EOS>
When
Britton
fled
in
sudden
fright
from
the
low
wall
by
Millbank
,
hetook
his
rout
up
Abingdon
-
street
,
and
turning
into
the
first
house
ofentertainment
he
saw
,
he
ordered
a
quantity
of
brandy
that
made
thelandlady
stare
again
;
but
when
he
lifted
the
measure
to
his
mouth
,
andthen
after
a
dead
silence
of
about
a
minute
,
laid
it
down
empty
,
theaforesaid
landlady
<EOS>
’s
eyes
became
much
larger
than
before
,
and
shelooked
again
and
again
in
the
measure
,
as
if
she
imagined
the
brandymight
still
be
only
lurking
in
some
corner
,
and
would
suddenly
make
itsappearance
again
.
<EOS>
When
Britton
then
struck
his
own
head
,
which
he
did
with
his
clenchedfist
,
the
landlady
gave
a
great
jump
,
and
exclaimed,—“Bless
us
,
and
save
us!”“I
am
a
fool
!
<EOS>
An
ass
!
”
cried
Britton
.
<EOS>
“
To
be
scared
by
a
shadow
—
<EOS>
curses!What
’s
to
pay
,
woman
?
<EOS>
Do
n’t
stand
staring
at
me!”“You
—
you’ve
<EOS>
had
a
—
pint
,
sir
,
”
gasped
the
alarmed
landlady
.
<EOS>
“Take
your
money
out
of
that
,
and
be
quick
,
”
cried
Britton
,
throwingdown
a
guinea
,
the
ring
of
which
on
a
little
bit
of
marble
,
which
thelandlady
kept
behind
the
bar
door
,
being
quite
satisfactory
,
she
turnedround
to
hand
her
customer
his
change
,
but
to
her
surprise
he
was
gone
.
<EOS>
Half
maddened
by
rage
and
drink
together
,
Britton
now
rushed
back
towhere
<EOS>
he
had
left
Maud
;
but
both
she
and
Sir
Frederick
,
from
the
paceat
which
they
had
immediately
left
the
place
,
were
out
of
sight
andhearing
;
muttering
,
therefore
,
imprecations
on
his
own
head
,
<EOS>
the
smithreturned
towards
Westminster
in
a
fit
mood
for
anything
.
<EOS>
“Fool
that
I
am
!
”
<EOS>
he
roared
,
for
the
tremendous
dose
of
brandy
he
hadtaken
made
him
quite
reckless
of
who
might
be
within
hearing
.
<EOS>
“
<EOS>
Idiot
!
<EOS>
Iwho
have
made
the
clang
of
my
hammer
heard
by

Fool

Would

No

no

<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
reeled
on
,
the
liquor
he
had
drunk
<EOS>
so
recklessly
each
momentexerting
greater
effect
upon
him
.
<EOS>
The
few
chance
passengers
whom
he
metheard
his
wild
ravings
before
he
reached
them
,
and
some
had
theprudence
to
cross
to
the
other
side
of
the
street
,
while
others
wouldstand
in
a
doorway
until
the
evidently
furious
man
had
gone
past
them
.
<EOS>
One
watchman
,
who
had
just
awakened
from
a
sound
nap
,
and
walked
out
ofhis
box
,
eager
to
show
his
efficiency
upon
somebody
,
had
the
temerityto
hold
up
his
lantern
in
Britton
’s
face
,
and
make
the
simple
andinnocent
remark
of—“Hilloa
,
friend!”Britton
was
,
however
,
in
no
humour
to
be
spoken
to
at
all
,
and
with
onecrashing
blow
of
his
herculean
fist
he
sent
watchman
and
lantern
intothe
middle
of
the
road
,
where
they
lay
a
dirty
mass
,
consistingprincipally
of
a
greatcoat
of
a
dingy
white
brown
,
with
the
lettersW.L.
,
signifying
Westminster
Liberties
,
on
the
back
of
it
.
<EOS>
This
little
adventure
calmed
,
in
a
slight
degree
,
the
animalirritability
of
Britton
;
and
although
he
shouted
and
reeled
along
in
astage
of
intoxication
only
one
degree
removed
from
the
last
,
he
spokemore
joyously
,
and
even
condescended
to
alarm
the
neighbourhood
by
somesnatches
of
Bacchanalian
songs
,
roared
out
in
a
voice
<EOS>
loud
enough
toarouse
the
celebrated
Seven
Sleepers
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
divers
of
the
indignantand
infuriated
inhabitants
opened
their
windows
,
and
called
“
watch!”but
as
no
watch
answered
,
they
closed
them
again
,
wondering
where
thewatchman
was
,
and
remarking
,
as
testy
old
gentlemen
do
now
of
the
newpoliceman
,
that
he
is
never
to
be
seen
when
he
is
at
allwanted,—although
,
in
this
case
,
the
watchman
might
have
been
seen
byany
curious
inhabitant
who
chose
to
walk
into
the
middle
of
the
road
inAbingdon
-
street
.
<EOS>
In
about
half
an
hour
the
guardian
of
the
night
recovered
;
and
asBritton
had
hurried
on
,
and
the
neighbourhood
was
restored
to
quiet
andserenity
,
he
roused
it
all
up
again
,
by
springing
his
rattle
,
andcrying
“
murder
!
”
<EOS>
for
about
five
minutes
incessantly
.
<EOS>
The
good
folks
of
Abingdon
street
and
its
vicinity
had
therefore
twoalarms
that
eventful
night
,
the
one
by
Britton
himself
roaring
throughthe
streets
when
there
was
no
watchman
,
and
the
other
by
the
watchmanwhen
there
was
nobody
to
apprehend
.
<EOS>
In
the
meanwhile
Britton
went
on
until
he
reached
,
more
from
habit
thandesign
,
the
door
of
the
Chequers
.
<EOS>
There
he
paused
,
and
as
it
happenedto
be
shut
,
by
way
of
saving
himself
the
trouble
of
knocking
or
liftingthe
latch
,
he
flung
himself
against
it
with
such
force
,
that
he
rolledinto
the
passage
,
as
if
he
had
been
suddenly
discharged
from
a
cannon
.
<EOS>
The
landlord
was
not
slow
in
recognising
his
Majesty
King
Britton
,
andstooped
to
assist
him
to
rise
with
all
humility
,
which
piece
ofkindness
was
rewarded
as
kings
very
often
reward
their
subjects
,
atleast
as
far
as
principle
went
,
for
the
smith
seized
the
unhappylandlord
by
the
hair
of
his
head
,
and
then
bumped
the
said
head
againstthe
floor
,
with
a
reiteration
of
blows
that
alarmed
the
house
.
<EOS>
“That
will
teach
you
to
shut
your
doors
in
the
faces
of
your
bestcustomers
,
”
stammered
Britton
,
rising
.
<EOS>
“Ye
<EOS>
—
ye
—
<EOS>
yes
,
”
said
the
landlord
,
rubbing
his
head
,
and
making
a
varietyof
wry
faces
,
“
I
—
I
—
really
—
good
Master
King
Britton
—
you
—
arequite
—
facetious
.
<EOS>
I
declare
I
never
had
such
knocks
on
the
head
in
mylife
.
<EOS>
I
’ll
see
you
hung
some
day
.
”
<EOS>
This
latter
sentence
was
utteredaside
,
and
with
an
air
of
candour
that
left
no
doubt
of
the
deepsincerity
of
it
.
<EOS>
“Stir
yourself
,
”
cried
Britton
.
<EOS>
“
Who
’s
here?”“Who
’s
here
,
King?”“Yes
<EOS>
—
Have
you
any
croaking
spies
here
?
<EOS>
Who
was
yon
vagabond
in
the
greycoat?”“The
—
<EOS>
the
—
villain
who
stood
in
your
worship
<EOS>
’s
<EOS>
way
awhile
<EOS>
ago?”“Ay
,
the
same
:
do
you
know
<EOS>
him?”“No
,
no
,
your
Majesty
.
<EOS>
”“So
<EOS>
much
the
better
.
<EOS>
I
do
know
him
,
and
if
you
had
,
I
’m
not
sure
<EOS>
but
Ishould
have
been
under
the
ne
—
ne
—
necessity
of
smashing
you
—
do
you
hear?”“Yes
—
most
humbly
—
Oh
,
I
shall
see
you
at
Tyburn
<EOS>
yet!”“What
’s
that
you
mutter?”“I
—
I
was
arguing
that
—
all
villains
ought
,
to
be
at
Tyburn
,
yourworship

”“Oh
,
ought
they
?
<EOS>
Then
why
ai
n’t
you
<EOS>
there?”“I
—
<EOS>
I
—
really
do
n’t
know
.
<EOS>
”At
<EOS>
this
juncture
,
when
the
courteous
host
felt
himself
rather
at
a
lossto
give
a
reason
why
he
should
not
be
hung
<EOS>
,
there
entered
the
house
alittle
bustling
man
,
exclaiming
,
<EOS>
as
he
came,—“Well

they

coming
it
—
there

<EOS>
nothing
but

You

in

<EOS>
Ah

<EOS>
No

aright
merry
scene

<EOS>
”“What

<EOS>
roared
Britton
.

“

winking
at

There

<EOS>
”“The

<EOS>
the

death
of
me
for
saying
lights?”“You
are
an

”
said
Britton
,
gravely
.
<EOS>
“Ah
,
a
rank
idiot

”
cried
the
landlord
,
winking
again
at
the
littleman
,
who
,
however
,
was
too
much
enraged
to
notice
the
telegraphicregard
of
the
politic
host
.
<EOS>
“I

<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
“
Well

I
never

said
Britton

“Sir

cried
the

giving
his

a
fierce
cock

“

landlord
now
winked
so
dreadfully
and
so
incessantly
,
that
itseemed
quite
doubtful
whether
or
not
he
would
ever
leave
off
again
;
butthe
little
man
was
not
to

winked
into
good

humour
,
and
shook
hishead
in
great
indignation

<EOS>
Britton
reeled
towards
the
bar
,
exclaiming
,
“
Give

now
took
the
opportunity

whispering
to
Master

<EOS>
”“I

<EOS>
cried
Sniggles
.
<EOS>
“Say

you

added
the
landlord
,
at
the

time
enforcinghis
argument
by
a
poke
in
the
regions
of
Master
Sniggles
’
ribs
.
<EOS>
“He’ll
be
desperate

<EOS>
Be

”“It
<EOS>
’s
not
very
pleasant

suggested
the
little
man
.
<EOS>
“Now

roared
Britton
,
returning
with
a
pewter
measure
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
“Are

explain

<EOS>
”“Ye

stammered
the
little
man
.
<EOS>
“
The
lights
,
good
sir

were
at
thelarge
house
belonging
to
the
rich
squire

whose
floors

they
say
,
arepaved
with
dollars

and
his

hung
with
gold

cuts

<EOS>
”“But
<EOS>
what
about

<EOS>
roared
Britton
.
<EOS>
“Why

Britton

<EOS>
“
He

”The
<EOS>
landlord
winked
at
Master
Sniggles
,
and
Master
Sniggles
this
timewinked
at
the
landlord
,
both
the
winks
signifying
how
very
far
gone
wasBritton
in
drunkenness
to
make
so
very
absurd
and
preposterous
a
remark

<EOS>
Britton
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
.
<EOS>
Then
a
half
-
drunken
,
half
-
malignant
smile
covered
his
swarthy
visage
.
<EOS>
“I
will
go

”
he
cried
,
“
I

only

<EOS>
Ha

Learmont

<EOS>
I
’ll

<EOS>
your

really

suggested
the
landlord
,
“
to
kick
up
aroyal
row
at
the
rich

said
Britton
.
<EOS>
“
I
will
have

There

”So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
dashed
from
the
Chequers
leaving
the
landlord

gazing
at

in
speechless
amazement

CHAPTER
XL.The
Old
House
Again.—Ada
’s
Alarm.—Gray
and
His
Gold
.
<EOS>
Ada
felt
that
after
the
experience
of
the
recent
interview
with
Gray
,
she
had
a
power
over
him
which
,
were
she
free
from
her
promise
not
toescape
,
she
might
use
for
the
purpose
of
restoring
herself
to
liberty
.
<EOS>
That
power
was
grounded
on
the
superstition
of
his
character
—
a
weaknesswhich
had
grown
with
his
crimes
,
and
been
increased
by
the
constantpangs
of
remorse
,
which
even
he
could
not
stifle
entirely
.
<EOS>
The
solitudelikewise
,
and
the
constant
state
of
trembling
anxiety
in
which
helived
,
had
shattered
his
nervous
system
to
that
degree
that
he
wasindeed
a
melancholy
and
warning
spectacle
of
the
mental
and
bodilywreck
to
which
crime
is
sure
to
reduce
its
unhallowed
perpetrators
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
sunken
and
blood
-
shot
,
his
lips
never
bore
the
hue
ofhealth
,
his
step
was
stealthy
and
trembling
,
and
his
hands
shook
likean
aspen
leaf
.
<EOS>
He
would
lock
himself
in
the
room
which
contained
hishoarded
wealth
,
and
recount
the
glittering
mass
for
hours
together
;
butstill
he
could
not
think
it
enough
.
<EOS>
The
demon
of
avarice
had
got
aclutch
of
his
heart
,
and
the
larger
the
amount
of
his
gold
became
,
thewider
range
<EOS>
his
love
of
the
bright
temptation
took
,
and
constantlyfixed
a
sum
far
beyond
what
he
had
as
that
which
would
content
him
andenable
him
to
put
in
practice
his
scheme
of
departure
from
England
,
andvengeance
upon
Learmont
and
Britton
.
<EOS>
“I
must
yet
have
more
,
”
he
would
mutter
.
<EOS>
“
’
Tis
but
a
short
delay
,
andLearmont
can
not
refuse
me
the
gold
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
two
hundred
more
of
thosepieces
shall
satisfy
me
.
<EOS>
That
will
make
up
a
goodly
sum
;
and
then
,
insome
other
land
,
I
shall
get
some
sleep
undisturbed
by
the
awfulvisions
that
here
crowd
upon
my
trembling
imagination;—but
two
hundredmore
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
may
get
so
much
before
this
month
is
past
,
and
then
Ishall
be
saved
the
trouble
of
extorting
a
renewal
of
the
promise
ofthis
wilful
girl
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
it
shall
be
so
.
<EOS>
I
will
raise
my
demands
uponLearmont
.
<EOS>
He
cannot
—
dare
not
say
me
nay
,
unless
I
were
to
becomeoutrageously
unreasonable
in
my
drafts
upon
his
purse.—Two
hundred.—Letme
<EOS>
think;—five
visits
at
twenty
pounds
each
will
be
half
the
money
.
<EOS>
Pshaw
!
<EOS>
I
will
have
forty
each
visit
.
<EOS>
Ay
,
forty
;
that
will
not
alarmhim
:
If
I
insist
on
more
he
might
,
in
his
cautious
brain
,
think
uponthe
scheme
I
mean
to
practise
,
and
take
some
means
of
most
effectuallypreventing
such
ruin
to
himself
.
<EOS>
I
will
lull
his
suspicions
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
What
aday
of
triumph
will
it
be
to
me
when
I
sail
from
England
with
theconviction
that
,
within
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
after
I
am
gone
,
Learmontand
Britton
will
each
inhabit
a
prison
.
<EOS>
They
will
then
confess
thatJacob
Gray
is
cunning
.
<EOS>
The
sneer
will
turn
with
an
awful
fact
to
them
.
<EOS>
There
is
but
one
drawback.—I
shall
not
see
them
hung
.
<EOS>
No;—I
cannot
—
darenot
—
stay
to
see
them
hung
.
<EOS>
Ada
will
be
rich
and
great
;
but
she
willknow
who
I
am
.
<EOS>
Will
she
use
her
wealth
in
hunting
me
through
the
world?Or
<EOS>
will
she
forgive
in
the
flush
of
her
prosperity
?
<EOS>
If
—
if
—
I
thoughtthat
the
firm
,
untameable
spirit
which
this
girl
evidently
possesses
,
and
which
I
may
confess
it
here
in
secret
,
daunts
<EOS>
me,—if
<EOS>
I
thought
itwould
induce
her
to
hunt
me
down
,
as
she
might
,
for
her
means
would
beample
for
such
an
object
,
were
I
hidden
even
in
the
bowels
of
theearth
,
<EOS>
I’d
—
I’d
—
<EOS>
kill
her
ere
<EOS>
I
went
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
some
night
when
she
slept
Icould
do
it
;
but
not
till
the
hour
before
I
meant
to
go
<EOS>
;
for
I
—
I
couldnot
stay
in
this
lone
place
without
her
.
<EOS>
She
scorns
me,—treats
me
witha
haughty
contempt
;
will
scarcely
condescend
to
address
me
:
but
stillshe
is
here
,
and
there
is
company
in
the
thought
that
I
know
I
am
notquite
alone
in
this
gloomy
place
.
<EOS>
She
may
load
me
with
opprobrium,—shemay
heap
scorn
upon
my
head
;
but
she
is
here
,
and
I
could
not
lie
downfor
one
night
here
,
without
the
conviction
that
there
was
some
one
elsewithin
these
walls
.
<EOS>
So
,
Ada
,
you
are
safe
now
—
very
safe
;
but
ere
I
go
Imust
<EOS>
seek
some
subtle
means
of
knowing
what
will
be
your
course
ofaction
when
you
know
all
,
and
the
name
of
Jacob
Gray
is
linked
with
acrime
that
will
rouse
your
nature
,
and
bring
an
angry
flash
to
youreye
.
<EOS>
Ha!—What
noise
was
that?”Gray
sprang
to
his
feet
,
and
he
trembled
violently
,
for
some
slightnoise
,
such
as
old
decayed
houses
are
full
of
,
came
upon
his
ear
in
thestillness
that
reigned
around
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
—
I
thought
I
heard
a
noise
,
”
he
muttered
;
“
<EOS>
but
I
have
thought
sooften
,
when
’
twas
nothing
.
<EOS>
Ada
is
here
;
I
am
not
quite
alone
;
should
Isee
anything
,
<EOS>
I
—
I
could
scream
,
and
then
she
might
come
,
perchance
,
toexult
in
my
agony
;
but
there
would
be
protection
in
herpresence
—
because
—
because
she
is
—
innocent.—Innocent!—Oh
,
God
!
<EOS>
Why
am
Inot
innocent
?
<EOS>
Is
all
this
world
and
its
enjoyments
a
gross
delusion
,
for
which
I
have
bartered
all
the
essence
and
foundation
of
alljoy
—
<EOS>
peace!”For
many
minutes
he
remained
silent
,
and
the
nervous
twitching
of
hiscountenance
betrayed
the
disturbed
condition
of
his
mind
.
<EOS>
Then
he
spokequickly
and
nervously
.
<EOS>
“I
must
not
give
way
to
thoughts
like
these
,
”
he
said
;
“
they
will
driveme
mad
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
murder
lies
that
way
.
<EOS>
I
must
go
on
now;—the
path
I
havechosen
<EOS>
is
one
which
there
is
no
retracing
.
’
<EOS>
Tis
as
if
a
wall
of
adamantfollowed
close
behind
,
to
prevent
one
backward
step
.
<EOS>
I
am
committed
<EOS>
tothe
course
I
have
taken;—to
pause
is
madness
.
<EOS>
I
must
go
on
—
I
must
goon
!
<EOS>
But
I
will
spare
you
,
Ada
,
if
I
can
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
sound
of
a
distant
clock
,
sounding
the
hour
of
twelve
,
now
cameupon
the
night
air
,
and
Jacob
Gray
listened
to
the
faint
moaning
tonesof
the
bell
until
all
was
still
again
,
and
no
sound
broke
the
solemnstillness
but
the
agitated
beating
of
his
own
heart
.
<EOS>
“Midnight
!
”
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
“
’
Tis
midnight
!
<EOS>
I
will
now
endeavour
to
snatch
afew
hours
’
repose
;
I
have
fatigued
myself
now
for
many
hours
,
with
thehope
that
the
body
’s
weariness
might
lull
the
mind
’s
agony
.
<EOS>
Agony
!
<EOS>
I
—
<EOS>
doI
call
it
agony
!
<EOS>
Is
that
all
I
have
purchased
by
—
<EOS>
crimes?”He
lifted
the
light
,
as
he
spoke
,
and
its
feeble
rays
fell
upon
theglittering
heap
of
gold
that
lay
before
him
.
<EOS>
A
ghastly
smile
playedacross
the
pale
countenance
of
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
“I
have
gained
something
,
”
he
said
,
as
he
laid
his
thin
,
cold
hand
uponthe
gold
.
<EOS>
“
Yes
,
I
have
gained
these
—
these
pieces
of
bright
metal
,
thatwill
exchange
for
honours
—
service
—
gay
attire
—
enchanting
music
—
nay
,
theywill
buy
what
men
affect
not
to
sell
—
opinion
.
<EOS>
There
may
be
some
purestate
of
society
,
in
which
,
when
speaking
of
a
man
,
the
question
maybe
,
‘
What
is
he
?
’
<EOS>
But
here
—
here
,
in
civilized
,
moral
,
intellectualEngland
,
the
question
is
,
‘
What
has
he
?
’
<EOS>
These
,
”
he
continued
,
runninghis
hand
among
the
guineas
;
“
these
even
will
purchase
prayers
toHeaven
;
petitions
to
God
from
the
good
,
the
saintly
,
and
the
pious
.
<EOS>
Gold
,
I
love
thee
—
but
now
to
bed
—
to
bed!”He
carefully
placed
his
treasure
in
its
recent
receptacle
at
the
backof
the
cupboard
,
and
then
with
a
faltering
step
,
and
a
shifting
glanceof
fear
,
he
repaired
to
his
own
chamber
,
which
was
near
to
Ada
’s
room
.
<EOS>
In
his
progress
he
passed
the
door
of
the
dormitory
of
his
victim
—
hepaused
a
moment
,
and
listened
attentively
.
<EOS>
Then
in
a
voice
of
deepanguish
he
said,—“She
can
sleep
—
she
can
sleep
—
no
ghostly
vision
scares
slumber
from
hereyes
—
while—”He
shuddered
,
and
passed
a
step
or
two
on
,
then
pausing
again
,
he
said,—“Oh
,
if
she
,
the
young
and
innocent
—
the
loved
of
Heaven
—
if
she
wouldbut
bid
me
a
‘
good
night
,
’
<EOS>
I
think
I
could
sleep
—
I
asked
her
once
,
andshe
would
not
—
no
,
she
would
not
give
me
so
much
peace
;
she
would
notsay
good
night
to
me!”These
words
were
spoken
by
Gray
in
a
tone
of
great
mental
anguish
,
andhe
passed
on
silently
to
his
own
chamber
.
<EOS>
A
silence
,
as
of
the
grave
,
reigned
over
the
old
house
,
and
an
uneasyslumber
crept
over
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
Well
might
the
man
of
crime
dread
to
sleep
;
for
,
although
exhaustednature
sunk
into
repose
,
the
busy
fancy
slept
not
;
but
,
ever
wakeful
,
conjured
up
strange
ghastly
shapes
to
scare
the
sleeper
.
<EOS>
The
imagination
,
unchecked
by
reason
,
began
its
reign
—
a
reign
sometimesso
full
of
beauty
and
joy
,
that
we
sigh
to
awaken
to
a
perception
ofthat
which
is
,
instead
of
remaining
in
the
world
of
dreams
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
<EOS>
’s
visions
,
however
,
took
the
shuddering
ghastly
complexionof
his
waking
thoughts
and
recollections
.
<EOS>
From
memory
’s
deepest
cells
would
these
creep
forth
one
by
one
inhideous
distinctness
—
remembrances
that
were
maddening
,
and
scenes
wouldbe
enacted
over
and
over
again
within
the
busy
chambers
of
the
brain
,
that
in
his
waking
moments
he
would
shun
the
faintest
reminiscence
of
,
as
he
would
the
terrors
of
a
pestilence
.
<EOS>
The
smithy
at
Learmont
rose
up
before
him
,
black
and
heavy
as
itappeared
among
the
drifting
snow
.
<EOS>
Then
he
would
hear
the
howling
of
thewind
even
as
it
howled
on
that
eventful
night
,
when
the
storm
was
justcommencing
—
momentarily
it
increased
in
fury
,
and
Jacob
Gray
felt
thatall
the
awful
events
of
that
night
were
to
do
again
;
why
or
whereforehe
knew
not
.
<EOS>
Then
the
smith
,
he
thought
,
took
him
by
the
throat
and
threw
him
downupon
a
ghastly
rotting
corpse
,
and
the
long
bony
arms
closed
over
him
,
while
he
felt
his
own
warm
living
face
in
hideous
contact
with
theslimy
rottenness
of
the
grave
,
he
heard
then
,
as
he
had
heard
it
onthat
dreadful
night
,
the
cry
of
fire
!
<EOS>
And
he
strove
with
franticefforts
to
free
himself
from
the
embrace
of
death
—
but
’
twas
all
in
vain
.

The
flames
then
waved
around
him
like
a
sea
,
and
the
skeleton
arms
grewto
a
white
heat
,
and
burnt
into
his
flesh
,
and
a
hot
pestilentialbreath
seemed
to
come
from
the
grinning
jaws
of
the
dead
—
still
he
couldnot
move
.
<EOS>
His
struggles
were
as
those
of
an
infant
in
that
awfulclutch
,
and
he
prayed
for
death
to
terminate
his
agony
.
<EOS>
Then
a
voice
said
,
“
No
!
<EOS>
You
will
remain
thus
till
time
is
no
more
.
<EOS>
”With
<EOS>
a
scream
Jacob
Gray
awoke
,
and
starting
wildly
from
his
couch
,
hesunk
on
his
knees
,
shrieking—“Mercy
—
mercy
!
<EOS>
Spare
me
,
Heaven!”CHAPTER
XLI.A
Human
Voice.—The
Departure.—An
Unexpected
Meeting.—The
Reception
.
<EOS>
The
dim
,
cold
,
uncertain
light
of
morning
was
faintly
gleaming
in
longsickly
streaks
in
the
eastern
sky
,
and
the
trembling
,
half
-
maddenedJacob
Gray
crawled
to
the
window
of
his
room
,
and
hastily
tearing
downsome
paper
that
patched
a
broken
pane
of
glass
<EOS>
,
he
placed
his
scorchedand
dry
lips
against
the
opening
,
and
drank
in
the
cool
morning
’s
<EOS>
airas
one
who
had
crossed
a
desert
would
quaff
from
the
first
spring
hemet
after
the
horrors
and
thirst
of
the
wilderness
.
<EOS>
On
his
knees
the
wretched
man
remained
for
some
time
,
until
the
madfever
of
his
blood
subsided
,
and
calmer
reflection
came
to
his
aid
.
<EOS>
“I
can
not
sleep
,
”
he
said
,
“
I
can
not
sleep—’tis
madness
to
attempt
it;my
waking
thoughts
are
bad
enough
,
but
when
reason
sleeps
,
and
theimagination
,
unshackled
by
probability
commences
its
reign
,
then
allthe
wildest
fancies
become
realities
and
I
live
in
a
world
of
horrors
,
such
as
the
damned
alone
can
endure
,
endurance
must
constitute
aportion
of
their
suffering
,
for
if
they
felt
so
acutely
as
to
decreasesensation
,
they
would
be
happy
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
What
can
I
do
,
I
must
restsometimes
.
<EOS>
Exhausted
nature
will
not
be
defrauded
of
her
rights
;
butwhile
the
body
rests
,
the
mind
seems
to
take
a
flight
to
hell
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
horrible
!
<EOS>
Horrible
!
<EOS>
I
—
I
—
wonder
if
Ada
be
awake
—
methinks
now
the
soundof
a
human
voice
would
be
music
to
my
ears
,
I
will
creep
to
her
chamberdoor
,
and
speak
to
her
the
slightest
word
in
answer
will
be
a
blessing
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
will
go
—
I
will
go
.
”
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
then
,
with
a
slow
and
stealthystep
,
left
his
chamber
,
and
as
he
glided
along
the
dim
corridor
of
thatancient
house
,
he
might
,
with
his
haggard
looks
and
straining
eyes
,
have
well
been
taken
for
the
perturbed
spirit
that
popular
superstitionsaid
had
been
seen
about
the
ill
-
omened
residence
of
crime
and
death
.
<EOS>
He
reached
Ada
’s
door
,
and
after
a
pause
,
he
knocked
nervously
andtimidly
upon
the
panel
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
answer
,
Ada
slept
—
she
was
dreamingof
happiness
,
of
joy
,
that
brought
pearly
tears
to
her
eyes
—
those
eyesthat
are
the
blissful
overflowings
of
a
heart
too
full
of
gratefulfeeling
.
<EOS>
Again
Jacob
Gray
knocked
,
and
he
cried
“
Ada
!
”
<EOS>
in
a
voice
thatwas
too
low
and
tremulous
to
reach
the
ears
of
the
sleeping
girl
,
butwhich
startled
Gray
himself
by
the
hollow
echoes
it
awakened
in
thesilence
of
the
gloomy
house
.
<EOS>
Again
he
knocked
,
and
this
time
Ada
started
from
her
sleep
—
Gray
heardthe
slight
movement
of
the
girl
.
<EOS>
“Ada
!
”
<EOS>
he
said
,
“
Ada
,
speak!”“Jacob
Gray
!
”
<EOS>
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“Ada
—
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
—
I
am
going
forth
—
speak
Ada
,
again
.
”“Wherefore
<EOS>
am
I
summoned
thus
early
?
”
<EOS>
said
Ada—“what
has
happened?”“Nothing
,
nothing
!
”
<EOS>
replied
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
Be
cautious
,
Ada
;
I
shall
not
returntill
night
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
waited
several
minutes
,
but
Ada
made
no
reply
.
<EOS>
Then
he
crept
slowlyfrom
<EOS>
the
door
muttering,—“She
has
spoken
—
I
think
there
is
some
magic
in
her
voice
,
for
I
ambetter
now
,
and
the
air
in
this
place
does
not
seem
so
thick
and
damp
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
there
are
evil
spirits
that
,
at
the
sound
of
the
voiceof
one
so
pure
and
innocent
as
she
,
are
forced
to
fly
,
and
no
more
loadthe
air
with
their
bad
presence
.
<EOS>
I
am
relieved
now
,
for
I
have
heard
ahuman
voice
.
<EOS>
”Gray
<EOS>
then
proceeded
to
a
lower
room
of
the
house
,
and
envelopinghimself
closely
in
an
ample
cloak
,
he
cautiously
opened
the
door
andwent
forth
secure
in
the
dim
and
uncertain
light
of
the
early
morning
.
<EOS>
The
air
was
cold
and
piercing
,
but
to
Jacob
Gray
<EOS>
it
was
grateful
<EOS>
,
forit
came
like
balm
upon
his
heated
blood
,
and
the
thick
teeming
fanciesof
his
guilty
brain
gradually
assumed
a
calmer
complexion
,
subsidinginto
that
gnawing
of
the
heart
which
he
was
scarcely
ever
without
,
andwhich
he
knew
would
follow
him
to
the
grave
.
<EOS>
He
skirted
the
hedges
,
concealing
himself
with
extreme
caution
,
untilhe
was
some
distance
from
Forest
’s
house
,
for
notwithstanding
the
greatimprobability
of
his
being
seen
at
so
early
an
hour
,
Jacob
Gray
was
oneof
those
who
,
to
use
his
own
words
to
Learmont
,
<EOS>
always
wished
safety
tobe
doubly
assured
.
<EOS>
Walking
rapidly
now
,
along
a
pathway
by
the
river
’s
side
,
he
soonneared
Lambeth
,
and
the
sun
was
just
commencing
to
gild
faintly
thehighest
spires
of
the
great
city
,
when
he
arrived
near
the
spot
whichis
now
occupied
by
the
road
leading
over
Vauxhall
-
bridge
.
<EOS>
Gray
began
now
to
look
about
him
for
some
place
in
which
to
breakfast
,
for
such
was
his
suspicious
nature
and
constant
fear
,
that
he
neverfrom
choice
entered
the
same
house
twice
.
<EOS>
As
chance
would
have
it
now
,
he
paused
opposite
the
doorway
of
the
public
-
house
called
the
King’sBounty
,
and
while
he
was
deliberating
with
himself
whether
he
shouldenter
or
not
,
he
started
and
trembled
with
apprehension
as
the
figureof
Sir
Frederick
Hartleton
passed
out
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
had
made
himself
well
acquainted
with
the
magistrate
bysight
,
for
curiosity
had
often
impelled
him
to
take
means
of
seeing
theman
to
whom
he
had
addressed
the
packet
containing
his
confession
,
and
,
from
whom
he
expected
his
revenge
against
Learmont
and
Britton
,
and
atthe
same
time
that
,
he
,
Gray
,
had
personally
to
dread
Sir
Frederickmost
,
of
all
men
,
while
he
should
remain
in
England
.
<EOS>
Gray
drew
back
as
the
magistrate
advanced
,
although
a
moment
’s
thoughtconvinced
him
of
the
extreme
improbability
of
his
being
known
even
tothe
vigilant
eye
of
Hartleton
,
who
had
almost
grown
proverbial
for
hisskill
and
tact
in
discovering
who
any
person
was
,
and
for
recollectingfaces
that
he
had
only
once
in
his
life
seen
.
<EOS>
Gray
was
so
near
the
doorway
that
he
had
to
move
in
order
to
allow
SirFrederick
to
pass
,
and
at
that
moment
their
eyes
met
.
<EOS>
The
magistrate
looked
earnestly
at
Gray
for
a
moment
,
and
then
passedon
.
<EOS>
During
that
brief
look
the
blood
appeared
to
Jacob
Gray
to
bealmost
congealing
at
his
heart
,
so
full
of
fear
was
he
that
somedistant
reminiscence
of
his
countenance
might
still
live
in
theremembrance
of
Sir
Frederick
Hartleton
.
<EOS>
Such
,
however
,
appeared
not
tobe
the
case
,
for
the
magistrate
passed
on
,
nor
once
looked
behind
him
,
to
the
immense
relief
of
Gray
,
who
now
made
up
his
mind
on
the
momentto
enter
the
house
from
a
feeling
of
intense
curiosity
;
to
know
whatbusiness
his
greatest
foe
could
have
there
at
such
an
early
hour
.
<EOS>
When
he
reached
the
small
sanded
parlour
of
the
little
hostel
,
he
foundseveral
persons
engaged
in
earnest
discourse
,
among
whom
he
had
nodifficulty
in
selecting
the
landlord
,
who
was
talking
earnestly
andloudly
.
<EOS>
“Ah
<EOS>
,
my
masters
,
”
cried
the
landlord
,
“
he
’s
a
brave
gentleman
and
aliberal
one
,
I
can
tell
you
.
<EOS>
He
said
to
me—‘Landlord
,
’
says
he—‘let
herhave
of
the
best
your
house
affords
,
and
send
your
bill
to
me’—that’swhat
he
said
—
<EOS>
and
it
’s
<EOS>
no
joke
<EOS>
,
I
can
tell
you
,
for
a
publican
to
be
ongood
terms
with
a
magistrate
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
dear
me
!
<EOS>
Then
you
should
have
seenhow
cold
and
wet
he
was
;
and
when
I
offered
him
my
Sunday
garments
,
hetook
them
with
a
thank
ye
,
landlord
,
that
was
worth
a
Jew
’s
eye
—
comingas
<EOS>
it
did
from
a
magistrate

you

”“Bring
<EOS>
me
a
measure
of
your
best
wine
,
”
said
Gray
,
“
and
whatever
youhave
in
the
house
that
I
may
make
a
breakfast
on
.
<EOS>
”This
<EOS>
liberal
order
immediately
arrested
the
landlord
’s
attention
,
asGray
fully
intended
it
should
,
and
mine
host
of
the
King
’s
Bountyturned
instantly
all
his
attention
to
a
visitor
who
orderedrefreshments
on
so
magnificent
a
scale
for
the
house
.
<EOS>
“Di

<EOS>
rectly
,
sir

”
<EOS>
cried
he
,
“
your
worship
shall
have
some

such

they

<EOS>
”“I

said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“By

said
the
landlord

<EOS>
“
Mayhap

”“By
<EOS>
my
faith

I
thought
as
much

<EOS>
”“Yet

stay

”
said
Gray
,
for
he
was
cautious
to
the
extreme
.
<EOS>
“
Do
youknow
when
Sir
Frederick
will
be
here
again?”“Not
till
to

morrow

”“Humph

<EOS>
Then
I
will
see
the

This

<EOS>
Your

will
be
ready

<EOS>
”“Who
<EOS>
can
this
be
that
he
calls
the
poor

”
<EOS>
thought
Gray
,
as
hefollowed
the
landlord
up
stairs
.
<EOS>
“This
way

exclaimed
the
loquacious
host
.
<EOS>
“
It
was
touch

gowith
her

Sir

<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
landlord
now
opened
a
door
,
and
,
popping
his
head
in
,
cried
in
avery
different
tone
to
that
in
which
he
addressed
Gray
,
upon
thesupposition
of
his
acquaintance
with
Sir

Hartleton,—“Hilloa

<EOS>
”Gray
had
not
hear
the
reply
;
but
he
entered
the
room
at
once
,
andconfronted
Mad
Maud
,
who
was
sitting
in
a
chair
,
looking
more
like
acorpse

“

<EOS>
exclaimed
Gray

cried

rising

trying

Gray
with

long
skinny
arms

“

Ha

Ha

shuddered
.
<EOS>
He
had
heard
that
wild
and
fearful
laugh
before
.
<EOS>
On
thenight
of
the
storm
at
Learmont
he
had
heard
it
,
and
he
had
neverforgotten
it
.
<EOS>
“You
<EOS>
—
you
lived
once
far
from
hence
?
”
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
“Far
—
very
far
.
’
<EOS>
Twas
a
weary
way
to
walk
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
I
slept
in
a
barn;and
<EOS>
they
hooted
me
out
in
the
morning
,
because
the
frown
of
God
wasupon
my

,
and
I
was
mad
<EOS>
—
yes
—
I
was
mad
,
so
they
who
had
sense
andjudgment
cast
me
out
.
<EOS>
”“You
know
Sir

”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“Frank
Hartleton
<EOS>
I
know

”
she
replied
.
<EOS>
“
He
was
always
kind
to

<EOS>
When

”“And

Those

made

an

spoke
them

<EOS>
”“Mad

There

<EOS>
he
then
said
aloud

<EOS>
“He

replied
Maud
,
with
a
shudder
;
“
but
the
watercame
up

saved

<EOS>
”“I

lulling

<EOS>
”Gray
absolutely
reeled
,
and
mechanically
sunk
into
a
chair
as
Maudspoke
,
and
a
conviction
crossed
his
mind
that
by
some
means
SirFrederick
Hartleton
was
on
the
scent
for
him
.
<EOS>
A
short
interval
ofconfused
and
agonising
thought
now
followed
.
<EOS>
Then
it
shaped
itself
intoa
course
of
detail
that
he
felt
was
the
only
one
presenting
a
chance
ofescape
,
and
that
was
to
discover
,
if
possible
,
in
what
particularmanner
the
danger
threatened
,
and
whether
it
was
near
or
remote
—
if
itconsisted
of
positive
knowledge
,
or
only
surmise
.
<EOS>
“Go
<EOS>
on
,
”
he
said
,
making
a
great
effort
to
speak
calmly
,
andcommunicate
his
feelings
.
<EOS>
“
Go
on

I
pray
you

<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
shall
have
the

<EOS>
Be
assured
you

shall!”“Ah
,
then
Britton
will
soon
die

<EOS>
I
shall
live
till
then
—
to
see
him
die

and
then
poor
Maud
is
willing
to
die

I
am
to
remain
here
till
he
comesagain

<EOS>
”“Who?”“Frank
Hartleton

on

He
says
that
the
career

is
now
over

<EOS>
Who
is
this
Gray

they
all
speak
to
me
about?”Jacob
<EOS>
Gray
started
,
and
fixed
his
eyes
intently
upon
poor
Maud
’s
<EOS>
face
,
for
an
awful
doubt
,
suggested
by
his
shivering
fear
,
came
across
hismind
,
that
he
might
be
falling
into
some
trap
laid
for
him
by
thecunning
of
the
magistrate
;
and
that
she
who
asked
of
him
so
strange
aquestion
might
be
only
aping
the
malady
she
seemed
to
suffer
under
.
<EOS>
“Don’t
you
know
Gray
?
”
<EOS>
he
said
sharply
,
at
the
same
time
fixing
hiskeen
,
ferret
-
looking
eyes
upon
the
door
,
and
then
suddenly
turning
themto
her
.
<EOS>
Maud
shook
her
head
;
and
there
was
something
so
genuine
in
hernegative
,
that
Gray
drew
a
long
breath
,
and
felt
re
-
assured
that
he
wasat
the
moment
safe
.
<EOS>
“Oh
,
Gray

”
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
“
Who
mentioned

<EOS>
He

dead

”“Dead?”“Yes

there
is
now
no

<EOS>
So
Sir

I

mentioned

said
Maud

<EOS>
“
’
Tis
very
strange

I
am
askedby
all
if
I
know

<EOS>
By
—
by
Hartleton?”“Yes
,
by
him
.
<EOS>
He
says
that
Gray
is
the
worst
villain
of
all
.
<EOS>
The
Lordof
Learmont
is
scarce
worse
than
Gray
.
<EOS>
Where
is
he
,
with
his
darkscowl
?
<EOS>
I
have
not
seen
him
for
some
days
,
that
is
,
since
he
would
nothave
the
fire
put
out

<EOS>
They
said
he
and
the
savage
smith
killed
DameTatton
,

took
the
child
away
;
but
I
know
better

ha

ha

<EOS>
Poor
MadMaud
knows
better

<EOS>
”“Then
<EOS>
Learmont
did
not
do
so
?
”
<EOS>
said
Gray
,
in
a
soft
insinuating
tone
.
<EOS>
“How
<EOS>
could
he
,
when
I
met
her
by
the
mill

stream
,
weeping?”“You
met
her?”“Ay
,
<EOS>
did
I
,
by
the

<EOS>
It
was
early
dawn

the

awake

<EOS>
Ha

<EOS>
I
met
her
,
and
,
I
will
tellyou
,
she
had
the

and
she
wept
while
I
kissed
and
blessed
it
.
<EOS>
”“But
,
about
this
man
,
Gray
?
<EOS>
Speak
more
of
him
<EOS>
—
I
pray
you
,
speak
of
him

<EOS>
”“I
know
him
not
,
but
Frank
Hartleton

who
always
had
a
kind
word
forpoor

which
makes
me
believe
him

he
says

that

<EOS>
”Gray
rose
with
his
features
convulsed
with
rage
and
fear
,
andapproaching
Maud

he
said
,
in
a
husky
whisper,—“Woman

on

did

say
those
words?”“He
did

<EOS>
It

“

sank
in

the

saying—“An

”Gray
threw
a
piece
of
gold
to
the
landlord
,
who
picked
it
up
,
andvanished
with
a
profusion
of
bows
,
to
tell
his
company
below
what
anice
gentleman
,
a
friend
of
the
great
Sir
Frederick
Hartleton
<EOS>
,
he
hadabove

who
not
only
paid
for
what
was
cooked
for
him
,
<EOS>
butrequested
he
might
be
charged
for
the
cooling
of
the
various
delicacies!“Now
<EOS>
,
that
’s
what
I
call
a
real
gentleman
,
”
added
the
landlord
;
<EOS>
“
andone
as
makes
a
virtuous
use
of
his
money
.
<EOS>
”When
<EOS>
Jacob
was
once
more
alone
with
poor
Maud
,
he
approached
her
<EOS>
andsaid,—“As
<EOS>
you
value
your
life
,
tell
me
all
.
<EOS>
”“My
<EOS>
life

<EOS>
Is

dead

”
<EOS>
she
replied
.
<EOS>
“What
<EOS>
do
you
mean
?
”
said
Gray
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
“Because
I
can
not
die
till
he
does
.
”“Listen
<EOS>
to
me
,
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
You
say
that
this
Hartleton
talks
ofimprisoning
Gray
.
<EOS>
Was
that
all
he
said?”“I
<EOS>
wept
,
and
he
would
not
then
take
from
me
what
the
angel
had
givenme
.
<EOS>
I
promised
her
by
a
name
,
as
sacred
to
me
as
that
of
Heaven
,
and
Icould
not
even
let
him
have
it,—no

no

He
pitied
my
tears

let
mekeep
the

<EOS>
”“Paper!—Paper!—What
paper?”“Oh
!
<EOS>
It
is
precious

<EOS>
continued
Maud
<EOS>
;
“
I
think
it
is
a
charm

<EOS>
is

truly

coming

”Maud
<EOS>
then
dived
her
hand
in
her
breast
,
and
produced
,
with
anexpression
of
intense
pride
and
satisfaction
,
the
scrap
of
paper
whichAda
had
given
her
,
with
the
faint
hope
that
it
might
meet
the
hands
ofAlbert
Seyton
.
<EOS>
She
held
it
out
to
Gray
to
read
,
and
as
he
did
so
,
andfully
comprehending
the
few
words
it
contained
,
his
lips
turned
to
anashy
paleness
,
and
his
brain
grew
dizzy
with
apprehension
.
<EOS>
“He
<EOS>
—
he
has
seen
this
?
”
<EOS>
he
gasped
.
<EOS>
“Who?”“Hartleton!”“Oh
<EOS>
yes
;
I
tell
you
he
wanted
it
,
but
he
would
not
tear
it
from
me
.
<EOS>
”Gray
made
a
snatch
at
it
,
and
tore
it
from
the
grasp
of
the
poorcreature
.
<EOS>
Maud
uttered
a
loud
scream
,
and
Gray
,
drawing
a
pistol
fromhis
pocket
,
stood
in
an
attitude
of
defence
,
as
he
heard
a
confusion
ofsteps
upon
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
“Give
it
to
me
!
”
<EOS>
shrieked
Maud—“Oh
!
<EOS>
As
you
hope
for
heaven
,
give
it
tome!”A
moment
<EOS>
’s
reflection
assured
Jacob
Gray
that
not
only
was
he
actingindiscreetly
,
but
that
he
had
no
time
to
lose
.
<EOS>
Hastily
concealing
thepistol
,
he
handed
the
paper
to
Maud
,
saying—“Hence
,
hence
;
I
did
but
jest
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
door
was
immediately
flung
open
,
and
several
heads
appeared
.
<EOS>
“This
poor
creature
is
mad

said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
She
—

In

was
outside

He
cast
one

With

<EOS>
Oh
,
what
a
fearful
race
home
that
was
to
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
He
knew
he
had
thestart
of
the
magistrate
by
some
quarter
of
an
hour
,
or
probably
more;but
<EOS>
still
that
was
not
time
sufficient
to
pause
upon
,
and
he
relaxednot
his
headlong
speed
till
he
came
within
sight
of
the
lone
house
<EOS>
thatwas
his
home
:
then
,
for
the
space
of
about
a
minute
,
he
turned
andlooked
back
to
see
if
he
were
followed
,
and
to
strive
to
think
what
heshould
do
when
he
did
reach
the
house
,
which
he
felt
could
shelter
himno
more
.
<EOS>
That
the
scrap
of
paper
in
the
possession
of
Mad
Maud
waswritten
by
Ada
,
he
did
not
entertain
a
doubt
,
but
it
utterly
foiled
allconjecture
to
think
how
she
could
have
found
the
opportunity
<EOS>
,
confinedas
she
was
,
of
giving
if
to
the
poor
creature
,
who
set
such
great
storeby
it
.
<EOS>
Forward
,
then
,
Jacob
Gray
rushed
again
,
after
ascertaining
that
therewas
no
one
within
sight
.
<EOS>
It
was
yet
very
early
,
and
but
few
personswere
out
,
so
that
Gray
hoped
he
might
be
able
to
cross
the
fieldswithout
being
seen
;
but
how
to
drag
Ada
away
and
leave
Forest
’s
housein
safety
,
before
Sir
Frederick
and
his
party
arrived
,
defied
histhoughts
,
and
he
groaned
and
struck
his
breast
in
the
bitterness
of
hisanguish
and
despair
.
<EOS>
“The
time
has
come
—
the
time
has
come
!
”
<EOS>
he
muttered
.
<EOS>
“
I
am
lost
—
lost!—Nochance!—No
hope
!
<EOS>
If
—
if
I
kill
Ada
<EOS>
—
what
then
?
<EOS>
I
only
exasperate
mypursuers
,
and
my
death
is
certain
.
<EOS>
I
have
,
if
taken
,
but
one
solitarygleam
of
hope
for
mercy
,
and
that
is
,
that
I
have
done
no
violence
toher
.
<EOS>
No
—
<EOS>
no
—
I
dare
not
kill
her
,
unless
she
would
betray
me
.
<EOS>
We
musthide
.
<EOS>
Aye
that
is
a
remote
chance
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
bounded
over
the
swampy
fields
and
gained
the
door
.
<EOS>
Without
pausingto
make
his
accustomed
signal
,
he
drew
from
his
pocket
<EOS>
the
key
whichhad
fitted
to
the
rusty
lock
,
and
in
another
moment
he
had
entered
hishouse
of
dread
and
danger
,
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
.
<EOS>
“I
have
yet
some
time
,
”
he
said
or
rather
panted
,
for
his
violent
rushhomeward
<EOS>
had
quite
exhausted
him
.
<EOS>
He
reeled
rather
than
walked
to
hisown
chamber
,
and
took
a
copious
draught
of
spirits
.
<EOS>
The
ardent
liquorin
his
excited
and
agitated
state
of
mind
appeared
to
have
but
<EOS>
littlemore
effect
upon
him
than
would
so
much
water
—
at
least
so
far
as
itspower
to
intoxicate
went
.
<EOS>
He
felt
refreshed
,
however
,
and
now
he
rushedto
the
window
,
which
commanded
an
extensive
view
across
the
fields
,
andhe
drew
a
long
breath
,
as
he
said
to
himself
with
a
sensation
ofrelief,—“I
do
not
see
them
yet
—
<EOS>
I
have
time
—
<EOS>
yes
,
still
some
time
!
<EOS>
Now
forAda
—
for
Ada
!
<EOS>
I
have
a
task
before
me!”He
crossed
the
corridor
to
see
if
Ada
was
in
her
own
room
.
<EOS>
The
doorstood
partially
open
.
<EOS>
“Ada
!
<EOS>
Ada
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Gray
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
answer
;
and
,
looking
into
thechamber
,
he
saw
she
was
not
there
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
he
started
.
<EOS>
The
sweetlyclear
and
natural
voice
of
Ada
emerging
from
an
upper
room
met
hisears
.
<EOS>
She
was
looking
out
at
the
blue
sky
,
and
watching
the
soaringlarks
,
totally
unconscious
of
the
sudden
return
of
Jacob
Gray
,
andfondly
anticipating
the
pleasure
—
for
all
our
pains
and
pleasures
arecomparative
—
and
it
was
a
pleasure
to
Ada
of
being
alone
for
a
whole
day
.
<EOS>
Gray
was
in
no
mood
for
singing
,
and
with
a
step
very
different
fromthe
cautious
stealthy
one
with
which
he
usually
crawled
about
thehouse
,
he
ascended
the
staircase
,
and
presented
himself
before
theastonished
eyes
of
Ada
.
<EOS>
“Returned
,
<EOS>
”
she
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
“Yes
—
returned
,
”
echoed
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
Ada
,
you
have
broken
your
vow
.
<EOS>
”“So
<EOS>
help
me
,
Heaven
,
no!”“You
have
,
”
cried
Gray
,
in
a
high
,
shrieking
voice
that
decreased
to
ahissing
sound
,
as
if
he
were
afraid
of
his
own
violent
outcry
.
<EOS>
“I
have
not
,
”
repeated
Ada
,
fearlessly
,
and
meeting
Gray
’s
eyes
with
aclear
and
open
gaze
that
he
shrunk
from
.
<EOS>
“The
—
<EOS>
the
scrap
of
paper
,
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
The

”“Liar

cried
Ada
,
with
an
energy
that
made
Gray
start
<EOS>
,
“

quailed
,
and
trembled
,
before
the
flashing
eye
of
Ada
,
who
,
as
shespoke
,
assumed
unconsciously
an
attitude
of
such
rare
grace
and
beauty
,
with
the
fire
of
heavenly
intelligence
and
truth
beaming
in
everyfeature
of
her
face
,
that
it
was
with
mixed
feelings
-
of
fear
,
hate
,
andadmiration
,
that
Gray
replied,—“You
have
made
an
indirect
attempt
to
escape
from
here

<EOS>
”“And
why
not
?

said
Ada

”Gray
walked
first
to
a
window
,
which
commanded
a
view
in
the
directionof
Lambeth

<EOS>
He
saw
as
yet
no
traces
of
the
magistrate

his
party
,
and
he
returned
to
Ada

<EOS>
“Attend

he
cried
.

“
There

started

“Yes

Gray
.
<EOS>
“
By

then
suddenly
clasped
herhands

uttered
a
cry

”Ada
sat
down
,

deep
emotion
was
evident
in
her
countenance

“Jacob

she
said
,

”“I

cried
Gray

<EOS>
“Your

quite
as
weighty

said
Ada

<EOS>
“Both

“To

“

”Gray
<EOS>
now
again
walked
to
the
window
,
and
this
time
he
started
back
witha
loud
cry
.
<EOS>
“They
are
coming
,
”
he
said
;
“
look

Ada
,
be
satisfied
that
neither

<EOS>
”Ada
<EOS>
sprang
to
the
window
,
and
at
some
considerable
distance
off
,
crossing
the
fields
,
towards
the
house
<EOS>
,
she
saw
three
men
who
werestrangers
to
her
.
<EOS>
“You
<EOS>
see
they
are
armed

said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“They

How
can

shrieked
Gray

<EOS>
“
There

not

<EOS>
”As
<EOS>
he
spoke
he
took
a
pistol
from
his
breast
,
and
turned
to
Ada
.
<EOS>
“You
know

<EOS>
”Ada
did
not
answer
,
and
after
regarding
her
fixedly
for
one
moment
tosee
<EOS>
what
impression
he
had
made
upon
her
mind
,
Gray
hastily
left
theroom
,
saying,—“Follow
quickly
.
<EOS>
We
have
time
enough
,
but
none
to
spare
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
led
her
to
the
crevice
in
the
wall
of
which
the
aperture
opened
,
leading
to
the
damp
vault
,
in
which
she
had
been
before
.
<EOS>
“The
ladder
is
on
the
inner
side

”
he
said
,
as
he
placed
a
chair
toassist
her
in
reaching
the
opening

”He
<EOS>
hastily
left
the
room
,
locking
the
door
behind
him
.
<EOS>
Ada
stood
upon
the
chair
and
looked
into
the
dismal
vault
,
from
whencea
damp
earthy
smell
arose
,
and
sighed
deeply
.
<EOS>
“Alas

<EOS>
she
said
,
“

through

slowly
descended

CHAPTER
XLIV.The
<EOS>
Search.—The
<EOS>
Confession.—The
<EOS>
Strange
Report.—An
Awful
Dilemma
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
’s
first
care
,
when
he
left
Ada
,
was
to
repair
to
the
room
inwhich
he
concealed
his
money
.
<EOS>
Hastily
collecting
together
the
reallylarge
sum
he
had
from
time
to
time
wrung
from
the
guilty
fears
<EOS>
ofLearmont
,
he
bestowed
it
about
his
person
,
and
then
carefully
placinghis
written
confession
,
with
its
dangerous
address
,
in
his
breast
,
hehurried
to
the
street
-
door
,
upon
the
back
of
which
he
wrote
with
apiece
of
chalk
,
”
J.G.
and
A.
left
here
June
2nd
,
”
thus
endeavouring
toparalyse
<EOS>
the
magistrate
’s
exertions
in
the
way
of
search
by
inducinghim
to
think
that
the
house
had
been
deserted
by
Jacob
Gray
for
sometime
.
<EOS>
He
then
with
wild
haste
ran
through
the
house
concealing
everything
inthe
shape
of
provisions
which
would
undeniably
indicate
a
recentoccupancy
of
it
.
<EOS>
Ada
’s
bed
and
his
own
he
cast
into
a
dusty
cupboard
,
and
altogether
succeeded
in
producing
a
general
appearance
of
litterand
desertion
.
<EOS>
Then
,
without
daring
to
cast
another
look
from
the
windows
,
for
fear
heshould
be
seen
,
he
rushed
to
the
room
in
which
he
had
left
Ada
,
andgetting
through
the
opening
in
the
wall
,
he
closed
the
panel
and
stoodtrembling
so
exceedingly
on
the
ladder
,
<EOS>
that
had
he
wished
he
couldscarcely
have
commanded
physical
energy
sufficient
to
descend
.
<EOS>
Hisobject
,
however
,
was
to
remain
there
,
and
listen
to
what
was
passing
,
which
he
could
not
do
below
.
<EOS>
“Ada
,
Ada
,
”
he
said
,
in
a
low
tone
,
“
you
—
you
are
safe?”“I
am
here
,
”
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“Hush
!
<EOS>
Hush
!
<EOS>
Not
another
word
,
not
even
a
whisper
;
hush
,
for
your
life
,
hush!”A
heavy
knock
at
the
outer
door
now
echoed
fearfully
through
thespacious
passages
and
empty
rooms
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
To
Gray
that
knockcould
not
have
been
more
agonising
<EOS>
had
it
been
against
his
own
heart
.
<EOS>
By
an
impulse
that
he
could
not
restrain
,
he
kept
on
saying
in
ahalf
-
choked
whisper
,
“
Hush
—
hush
—
hush
!
”
<EOS>
while
he
clutched
the
sides
ofthe
ladder
till
his
nails
dug
painfully
into
the
palms
of
his
hands
,
and
a
cold
perspiration
hung
in
massive
drops
upon
his
brow
.
<EOS>
Adameanwhile
was
getting
a
little
used
to
the
darkness
of
the
place
,
andfeeling
cautiously
about
<EOS>
,
she
found
one
of
the
baskets
she
recollectedto
have
seen
there
before
.
<EOS>
This
she
sat
down
upon
,
and
burying
her
facein
<EOS>
her
hands
<EOS>
,
she
gave
herself
up
to
gloomy
reflections
,
while
tears
,
which
she
would
not
let
Jacob
Gray
see
for
worlds
slowly
andnoiselessly
trickled
through
her
small
fingers
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
moments
the
knock
at
the
door
again
sounded
through
the
house
,
and
Gray
,
although
he
was
expecting
it
,
nearly
fell
from
the
ladder
inthe
nervous
start
that
he
gave
.
<EOS>
Then
followed
a
long
silence
,
after
which
a
voice
came
to
his
ears
inindistinct
tones
,
saying
something
which
terminated
with
the
words,—“Inthe
King
’s
name
.
<EOS>
”There
was
then
a
slight
pause
,
followed
in
a
moment
by
a
crash
;
andJacob
Gray
knew
that
the
doors
were
burst
open
.
<EOS>
A
sensation
of
awful
thirst
now
came
over
Gray
—
such
thirst
as
he
hadread
of
only
as
being
endured
by
adventurous
travellers
in
crossinghundreds
of
miles
of
sandy
desert
.
<EOS>
His
tongue
seemed
to
cleave
to
theroof
of
his
mouth
,
and
his
parched
lips
were
like
fire
to
his
touch
.
<EOS>
Still
he
clutched
by
the
ladder
,
and
each
slight
noise
that
met
hisoverstrained
attention
added
fearfully
to
the
pangs
of
apprehensionthat
tortured
him
thus
physically
and
mentally
.
<EOS>
He
could
hear
the
sound
of
heavy
footsteps
through
the
house
,
andoccasionally
the
low
murmur
of
voices
came
upon
his
ears
,
although
hecould
not
detect
what
was
said
.
<EOS>
That
they
would
,
however
,
come
to
theroom
from
which
he
was
only
separated
by
a
thin
piece
of
wainscottinghe
knew
;
and
if
his
dread
and
agitation
were
great
now
,
he
thought
witha
shudder
what
would
be
his
feelings
when
each
moment
might
produce
hisdiscovery
and
capture
.
<EOS>
Then
he
strained
his
ear
to
listen
if
he
could
hear
Ada
moaning
,
and
alow
stifled
sigh
ascended
from
the
gloomy
vault
.
<EOS>
“Yes
,
yes
,
”
he
thought
.
<EOS>
“
She
will
be
still
—
she
will
be
still
.
<EOS>
The
fearof
a
sudden
and
violent
death
is
upon
her
young
heart
.
’
<EOS>
Tis
<EOS>
well
,
’
tisvery
well
,
now
she
thinks
me
the
unscrupulous
man
—
the
—
the
murderer
thatshe
taunts
me
with
being
.
<EOS>
She
<EOS>
—
she
does
not
suspect
that
if
I
weretaken
,
my
only
hope
of
mercy
would
be
in
having
preserved
her
life
—
and
,
and
my
only
plea
would
be
that
not
a
hair
of
her
head
was
injured
.
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
she
guesses
not
the
value
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
I
—
<EOS>
I
have
been
cunning
,
very
,
very
cunning
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
if
they
find
me
,
what
evidence—”Jacob
<EOS>
Gray
very
nearly
uttered
a
cry
of
terror
as
this
thought
<EOS>
passedthrough
his
mind
<EOS>
,
for
he
immediately
then
recollected
his
own
writtenconfession
that
he
had
in
the
breast
pocket
of
his
coat
,
and
which
,
ifhe
were
taken
,
would
be
his
destruction
.
<EOS>
He
struck
his
forehead
with
his
clenched
hand
,
and
uttered
a
deepgroan
.
<EOS>
What
means
had
he
there
,
situated
as
he
was
,
of
destroying
thedamning
evidence
of
a
guilt
which
otherwise
would
only
rest
onconjecture
and
surmise
,
and
from
the
consequences
of
which
,
it
notbeing
distinctly
proved
,
the
money
and
influence
of
Learmont
,
exertedfor
his
own
sake
,
might
actually
free
him
.
<EOS>
The
written
confession
wasan
admirable
weapon
against
Learmont
,
so
long
as
he
,
Jacob
Gray
,
hadthe
control
of
it
,
and
lived
;
but
now
,
when
there
was
a
fearful
chanceof
his
own
apprehension
,
it
was
at
once
converted
into
a
fearful
weaponagainst
himself
,
and
a
damning
evidence
of
his
guilt
.
<EOS>
For
some
moments
he
was
incapable
of
anything
resembling
rationalthought
,
and
his
reason
seemed
tottering
to
its
base
.
<EOS>
This
state
ofmind
,
however
,
passed
away
,
and
how
to
destroy
his
confession
becamethe
one
great
question
that
agitated
and
occupied
his
throbbing
andintensely
labouring
brain
.
<EOS>
If
he
attempted
to
tear
it
into
fragments
,
he
must
either
cast
thesefragments
on
the
door
of
the
vault
,
from
whence
they
would
easily
berecovered
,
or
he
must
keep
them
in
his
possession
,
which
would
availhim
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
thought
of
descending
the
ladder
,
and
digging
a
hole
with
his
hands
,
in
which
to
bury
the
dangerous
document
,
but
then
Ada
was
there
,
andwould
by
the
dim
light
of
that
place
<EOS>
see
what
he
was
about
,
and
it
wasnot
to
be
supposed
that
she
would
keep
a
secret
<EOS>
she
was
so
strongly
andpersonally
interested
in
revealing
.
<EOS>
There
was
but
one
other
resource
that
occurred
to
the
maddened
brain
ofJacob
Gray
,
and
that
was
one
which
,
in
his
present
state
,
nothing
butthe
abject
,
awful
fear
of
death
by
the
hands
of
the
executioner
<EOS>
couldhave
brought
him
to
<EOS>
—
it
was
to
tear
the
confession
into
small
pieces
,
and
eat
it
.
<EOS>
With
trembling
hands
,
while
he
stood
upon
the
ladder
as
well
as
hecould
,
he
drew
the
paper
from
his
breast
,
and
notwithstanding
his
awfuland
intense
thirst
,
he
began
tearing
off
piece
by
piece
from
it
,
andforcing
himself
to
swallow
it
.
<EOS>
Thus
had
this
written
confession
—
this
master
-
stroke
of
policy
,
<EOS>
uponwhich
he
had
so
much
prided
himself
,
become
to
him
a
source
of
tormentand
pain
.
<EOS>
Occasionally
he
could
hear
a
door
shut
in
the
house
,
as
Sir
FrancisHartleton
and
his
two
officers
pursued
their
search
,
and
he
went
onwith
frantic
eagerness
devouring
the
paper
.
<EOS>
Now
,
by
the
distinctness
of
the
sounds
,
he
felt
sure
those
who
soughthim
were
in
the
next
apartment
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
short
moments
they
would
bethere
,
his
danger
was
thickening
,
and
the
confession
was
not
halfdisposed
of
.
<EOS>
With
trembling
fingers
,
that
impeded
themselves
,
he
toreoff
large
pieces
,
and
forced
them
into
his
mouth
,
to
the
danger
ofchoking
himself
.
<EOS>
Now
he
really
heard
the
door
of
the
room
open
,
and
the
heavy
tread
ofmen
upon
the
floor
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
moments
there
was
a
death
-
like
stillness
,
and
Jacob
Gray
stood
in
the
act
of
suspending
mastication
,
with
a
largepiece
of
the
confession
fixed
in
his
teeth
.
<EOS>
Then
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
’s
voice
,
or
what
he
guessed
to
be
his
,
fromthe
tone
of
authority
in
which
he
spoke
,
came
upon
Gray
’s
ears
.
<EOS>
“This
is
very
strange
,
”
he
said
.
<EOS>
“
To
my
thinking
,
there
are
evidentindications
of
recent
inhabitants
in
this
house
.
<EOS>
Go
down
to
the
door
,
and
ask
your
comrade
if
he
has
heard
anything
.
<EOS>
”“Yes
,
Sir
Francis
,
”
replied
another
voice
,
and
the
door
closed
,
indicative
of
the
man
proceeding
on
his
errand
.
<EOS>
“Now
—
now
,
”
thought
Gray
,
“
if
we
were
alone
—
if
there
were
no
other
,
apistol
would
rid
me
for
ever
of
his
troublesome
and
most
unwelcomevisit
.
<EOS>
”Sir
<EOS>
Francis
spoke
,
as
if
communing
with
himself
,
in
a
low
voice
—
but
inthe
breathless
stillness
around
,
Gray
heard
distinctly
what
he
said
.
<EOS>
“Is
it
possible
that
the
man
Gray
has
left
here
?
”
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
“
Are
we
,
after
all
,
as
far
off
the
secret
as
ever
?
<EOS>
And
yet
I
can
not
think
so
.
<EOS>
What
could
be
the
motive
of
such
an
inscription
on
the
door
as
thatwhich
states
his
departure
more
than
a
month
since
.
<EOS>
It
is
some
trickmerely
.
<EOS>
By
Heavens
,
that
must
have
been
Gray
who
left
the
King
<EOS>
’s
Bountyso
soon
before
me
.
<EOS>
The
fates
seem
to
be
propitious
to
the
rascal
,
andto
aid
him
in
every
way
.
<EOS>
I
made
sure
the
information
was
good
,
and
thatI
had
him
here
safe
for
the
fetching
merely
.
<EOS>
”Sir
<EOS>
Francis
now
walked
to
and
fro
in
the
room
for
some
minutes
;
then
hepaused
and
said,—“He
ca
n’t
be
hiding
here
anywhere
.
<EOS>
The
old
house
is
full
of
cupboardsand
closets
,
but
they
are
very
easily
searched
.
<EOS>
Learmont
,
Learmont
!
<EOS>
Areyou
still
to
triumph
in
your
villany
for
a
time
?
<EOS>
I
could
stake
my
lifeupon
the
fact
that
some
crime
of
black
hue
was
committed
that
night
ofthe
storm
at
the
Old
Smithy
at
yonder
village
.
<EOS>
The
issues
of
the
crimeare
still
at
work
,
but
they
are
not
revealed
.
<EOS>
Humph
!
<EOS>
It
’s
of
no
useapprehending
Britton
on
mere
vague
suspicion
.
<EOS>
No
,
that
would
be
veryfoolish
,
for
it
would
set
the
whole
party
on
their
guard
,
and
thatwhich
is
difficult
now
might
become
impossible
.
”“Please
<EOS>
your
worship
,
he
ai
n’t
heard
nothing
,
”
said
the
man
,
at
thismoment
entering
the
room
again
.
<EOS>
“No
noise
of
any
kind?”“No
,
nothing
,
your
worship
.
<EOS>
”“No
<EOS>
one
has
crossed
the
fields
within
view
since
he
has
stood
guard?”“Not
a
mouse
,
your
worship
.
<EOS>
”“Very
<EOS>
well
.
<EOS>
Now
go
and
search
the
lower
rooms
thoroughly
,
and
then
comeback
to
me
here
.
<EOS>
I
shall
rest
on
this
chair
awhile
.
<EOS>
”So
<EOS>
saying
,
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
sat
down
on
the
chair
which
Ada
hadstood
upon
to
enable
her
to
reach
the
panel
that
opened
to
the
vault
.
<EOS>
How
little
the
poor
,
persecuted
Ada
imagined
that
a
powerful
friend
wasvery
near
to
her
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
was
now
almost
afraid
to
breathe
,
so
close
was
themagistrate
to
him
.
<EOS>
Had
the
wainscotting
not
intervened
,
Gray
could
,
hadhe
been
so
minded
,
have
touched
Sir
Francis
’s
head
without
moving
fromwhere
he
stood
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
spoke
again
.
<EOS>
“I
wonder
,
”
he
said
,
“
if
this
girl
that
the
Seytons
speak
of
,
and
yonpoor
creature
,
Maud
,
raves
of
as
an
angel
,
be
really
the
child
that
wassaved
from
the
Smithy
on
the
night
of
the
storm
and
the
murder
?
<EOS>
I
haveonly
one
very
substantial
reason
for
thinking
so
,
and
that
is
,
that
thename
of
Britton
is
mixed
up
with
the
business
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
the
datescorrespond
pretty
well
with
what
the
young
man
,
Seyton
,
says
he
thinksis
her
age
.
<EOS>
It
’s
rather
strange
though
,
<EOS>
that
no
one
except
Maudmentions
Learmont
at
all
in
the
matter
,
and
her
mention
of
him
isnothing
new
.
’
<EOS>
Tis
a
mysterious
affair
,
and
,
at
all
events
,
this
man
,
Gray
,
is
at
hide
and
seek
for
some
very
special
reason
indeed
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
man
who
had
been
sent
to
examine
the
lower
rooms
now
returned
.
<EOS>
“Well
,
”
said
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
“There
ai
n’t
not
nothing
,
your
worship
,
by
no
means
,
”
he
said
.
<EOS>
“You
have
searched
carefully?”“Yes
,
your
worship
.
<EOS>
I
’d
take
my
solemn
davy
as
there
<EOS>
’s
nothing
here
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
know
I
can
rely
upon
you
,
”
said
Sir
Francis
,
in
a
tone
ofdisappointment
.
<EOS>
“Ex
—
actly
,
your
worship
.
<EOS>
”“Do
<EOS>
you
think
there
are
any
hiding
places
about
this
house?”“Can’t
<EOS>
say
as
I
does
.
<EOS>
Your
worship
sees
as
it
’s
a
house
a
standing
allalone
,
and
there
ai
n’t
no
great
opportunity
to
make

places

.
<EOS>
”“I
will
make
one
more
effort
,
”
said
Sir
Francis
;
“
it
is
a
forlorn
hope;but
if
the
girl
be
hiding
anywhere
in
this
house
under
the
impressionthat
<EOS>
I
am
an
enemy
,
she
may
hear
me
and
put
faith
in
my
words
.
<EOS>
I
willcall
to
her
.
<EOS>
”Sir
<EOS>
Francis
rose
as
he
spoke
;
and
Jacob
Gray
,
upon
whom
thisdetermination
came
like
a
thunder
-
clap
,
dropped
from
his
tremblinghands
the
remnant
of
the
confession
he
had
been
eating
,
and
curling
hisfeet
round
the
ladder
,
he
slid
in
a
moment
to
the
damp
floor
of
thevault
.
<EOS>
His
great
dread
was
,
that
on
the
impulse
of
a
moment
,
Ada
mightanswer
any
call
to
her
by
name
;
and
he
knew
that
,
close
as
SirHartleton
was
,
the
least
shrill
cry
of
hers
must
inevitably
reach
hisears
,
when
instant
discovery
and
capture
would
be
certain
to
follow
.
<EOS>
Drawing
then
his
pistol
from
his
pocket
,
he
felt
about
for
Ada
.
<EOS>
“Ada
,
Ada
,
”
he
said
,
in
the
faintest
whisper
.
<EOS>
“Here
,
”
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“Hush
,
”
said
Gray
,
as
he
grasped
her
arm
;
“
speak
above
the
tone
I
use
,
and
you
seal
your
own
destruction
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
placed
,
as
he
spoke
,
the
cold
muzzle
of
a
pistol
against
herforehead
<EOS>
,
Ada
shuddered
as
she
said—“What
is
that?”“A
pistol
!
<EOS>
Make
the
least
noise
—
raise
the
faintest
cry
,
and
I
will
pullthe
trigger
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
a
mangled
corpse
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Hush
,
hush
,
hush!”A
voice
now
reached
the
ears
of
Ada
,
and
thrilled
through
the
veryheart
of
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
voice
of
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
which
,
now
that
he
raised
it
to
a
high
key
,
was
quite
audible
to
Ada
,
whilebefore
,
from
the
low
position
she
occupied
at
the
bottom
of
the
vault
,
she
had
only
heard
a
confused
murmuring
of
voices
,
without
being
ableto
detect
what
was
said
.
<EOS>
“Ada
!
”
cried
the
magistrate
;
“
Ada!”The
girl
clasped
her
hands
,
and
an
answering
cry
was
on
her
lips
,
butthe
cold
barrel
of
the
pistol
pressed
heavily
and
painfully
against
herbrow
,
and
Gray
,
with
his
lips
close
to
her
ear
,
said,—“Hush
,
hush
!
”
<EOS>
prolonging
the
sound
till
it
resembled
the
hissing
ofsome
loathsome
snake
.
<EOS>
“Ada
!
”
<EOS>
again
cried
Sir
Francis
,
“
Ada
!
<EOS>
If
you
are
concealed
within
,
hearing
of
my
voice
,
be
assured
it
is
a
friend
who
addresses
you
.
<EOS>
”A
<EOS>
low
gasping
sob
burst
from
Ada
,
and
Gray
again
hissed
in
her
ear,—“A
word
,
and
you
die
.
<EOS>
You
are
a
corpse
if
you
speak
;
and
all
hope
ofseeing
Albert
Seyton
in
this
world
will
be
past!”“Ada
!
”
<EOS>
again
cried
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
“
Speak
if
you
be
here
.
<EOS>
A
friendaddresses
you
,
I
am
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
the
magistrate
.
<EOS>
”Ada
made
a
slight
movement
and
Gray
pressed
her
quite
back
with
theviolence
with
which
he
held
the
pistol
against
her
temple
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
dead
silence
now
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
said
no
more
,
Ada
’s
hope
waspast
.
<EOS>
Still
,
however
,
Gray
stood
close
to
her
with
the
pistol
;
and
asthe
murderer
and
the
innocent
Ada
remained
thus
strangely
situated
,
itwould
have
been
difficult
to
say
which
suffered
the
most
mental
agonyof
the
two
.
<EOS>
Ada
to
know
that
relief
had
been
so
near
without
the
powerto
grasp
at
it
—
or
Gray
to
know
that
one
word
from
her
would
haveconsigned
him
to
a
prison
,
from
whence
he
would
never
have
emerged
butto
ascend
the
scaffold
to
die
a
death
of
ignominy
and
shame
.

<EOS>
Cunning.—The
Cupboard
on
the
Stairs
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
search
which
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
had
made
—
asearch
that
satisfied
him
that
Ada
had
been
removed
from
Forest
’s
houseby
the
cunning
of
Gray
—
he
could
not
divest
himself
of
the
idea
that
oneor
both
might
return
to
the
old
mansion
,
if
for
no
other
purpose
<EOS>
thanto
remove
some
of
the
articles
,
which
in
the
course
of
his
researcheshe
had
found
in
various
closets
and
cupboards
,
into
which
they
had
beenhastily
thrust
by
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
In
case
such
a
thing
should
be
,
after
some
consideration
,
he
resolvedto
have
one
of
his
men
there
for
several
days
,
and
he
accordinglyturned
to
him
who
had
been
guarding
the
door
,
and
said,—“Elias
<EOS>
,
you
must
remain
here
for
a
few
days
.
<EOS>
”“Here
,
Sir
Francis
?
<EOS>
In
this
old
house
,
your
worship?”“Yes

here
in
this
old
house
,
Elias
.
<EOS>
You
are
strong
,
fearless
,
and
wellarmed
.
<EOS>
Arrest
any
one
who
comes
here
.
<EOS>
”“Yes
,
”
said
Elias
,
looking
about
him
,
not
over
well
pleased
with
hiscommission
,
as
it
did
not
promise
much
comfort
or
sprightly
company
—
<EOS>
twothings
that
Elias
was
rather
partial
to
.
<EOS>
“I
expect
a
thin
,
sallow
man
,
”
continued
sir
Francis
,
“
to
come
here
,
ofa
pale
and
anxious
cast
of
countenance
.
<EOS>
Arrest
him
by
all
means
.
<EOS>
”“Yes
,
your
worship
.
<EOS>
”“And
should
a
young
girl
come
with
him
,
or
by
herself
,
mind
,
Elias
,
sheis
a
lady
,
and
take
care
<EOS>
you
treat
her
respectfully
.
<EOS>
”“A
lady
!
”
<EOS>
ejaculated
Elias
,
with
astonishment
.
<EOS>
“
Your
worship
,
is
she
areal
lady
,
or
like
Moll
Flaherty?”“Pshaw
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
“
Treat
her
,
I
say
,
with
respect
,
and
bringher
to
me

”“Oh

<EOS>
Bring
her
to
your
worship
—
<EOS>
oh!”“Now
you
have
your
instructions
.
<EOS>
It
’s
warm
,
so
you
can
do
without
afire
<EOS>
and
it
’s
<EOS>
light
,
and
smoke
would
scare
away
the
people
I
wish
tocome
.
<EOS>
When
you
sleep
,
Elias
,
shut
your
door
lightly
,
so
that
you
mayhear
if
any
one
comes
.
<EOS>
Upon
consideration
,
however
,
you
had
better
situp
all
night
,
and
sleep
a
little
in
the
day
time
,
for
those
that
I
seekare
not
likely
to
venture
across
the
fields
,
lest
they
should
be
seen
.
<EOS>
”“Your
<EOS>
worship
’s
unkimmon
considerate
,
and
very
kind
<EOS>
,
”
muttered
Elias
.
<EOS>
“You
<EOS>
have
your
lantern
,
Elias?”“Yes
,
your
worship
,
and
lots
of
little
wax
<EOS>
ends
put
in
it
.
<EOS>
”“Very
<EOS>
well

<EOS>
Now
,
good
day
.
<EOS>
Keep
a
good
watch
,
Elias
—
and
,
do
you
hear?There
’s
fifty
pounds
reward
for
either
the
man
or
the
girl
.
<EOS>
”“Fifty!”“Yes
,
from
me
;
so
you
know
you
are
sure
of
it
if
you
earn
it
.
”“Oh
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Elias
,
looking
round
,
him
,
with
a
very
differentexpression
,
upon
the
old
house
.
<EOS>
“
It
’s
a
very
comfortable
place
,
indeed
,
your

.
<EOS>
”“By
<EOS>
-
the

said
Sir
Francis
,
“
I
forgot
one
thing
—
the
girl
may
come
inboy

”“Oh

,
the

”
said
Elias
.
<EOS>
“So

you

”“The

”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Elias
.
<EOS>
“
Fifty
pounds

<EOS>
Bless
her

<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
magistrate
then
reflected
a
moment
,
and
not
recollecting
anythingelse
that
it
was
necessary
to
impress
upon
the
sensitive
mind
of
Elias
,
he
was
turning
away
from
the
door
,
when
that
gentleman
himself
suddenlythought
of
something
of
the
very
greatest
importance
in
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
“Your
worship
,
”
he
said
,
“
my
victuals
—
my
victuals
,
your
worship
.
<EOS>
”“What
?
”
said
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
“Am
<EOS>
I
to
be
starved
,
your
worship
?
<EOS>
How
am
I
to
get
my
victuals?”Sir
Francis
smiled
,
as
he
replied,—“I
should
not
have
forgotten
you
.
<EOS>
You
must
do
the
best
you
can
tillsunset

when
I
will
send
Stephy

you

<EOS>
”“Well
<EOS>
,
”
exclaimed
Elias
,
“
it
is
a
mercy
that
I
tucked
in
a
tolerablebreakfast
.
<EOS>
”Sir
<EOS>
Francis
now
left
the
house
with
his
other
companions
,
and
Elias
,
who
was
remarkable
for
his
size
and
great
personal
strength
,
closed
thedoor
,
and
began
to
bethink
how
he
should
amuse
the
leisure
hours
untilsunset
,
when
the
welcome
provisions
should
arrive
;
after
which
time
hedid
not
contemplate
that
the
time
would
hang
at
all
heavily
upon
hishands
.
<EOS>
In
the
meanwhile
Jacob
Gray
remained
in
the
vault
,
threatening
Ada
,
until
he
thought
all
danger
must
be
past
,
from
the
extreme
quiet
thatreigned
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
Not
the
most
distant
notion
of
Sir
FrancisHartleton
’s
leaving
any
one
behind
him
to
keep
watch
in
the
lonelymansion
,
occurred
to
Jacob
Gray
,
and
after
half
an
hour
,
as
he
guessed
,
had
very
nearly
passed
away
,
he
began
to
breathe
a
little
more
freely
,
and
to
congratulate
himself
that
for
that
time
at
least
the
danger
hadblown
over
his
head
.
<EOS>
During
that
half
hour
he
made
a
determination
to
leave
the
house
,
andfor
the
short
time
now
that
he
would
stay
in
England
—
for
he
wasthoroughly
scared
,
and
resolved
to
be
off
very
soon
—
he
would
take
somelodging
for
himself
and
Ada
,
at
the
same
time
binding
her
by
a
solemnpromise
,
as
before
,
not
to
leave
him
,
which
promise
he
would
now
renderless
irksome
to
her
,
by
representing
that
in
a
short
time
she
should
bequite
free
to
act
as
she
pleased
,
as
well
as
knowing
everything
<EOS>
thatmight
concern
her
or
her
future
fortunes
.
<EOS>
With
this
idea
,
and
believing
the
danger
past
,
he
spoke
in
a
moreunembarrassed
tone
to
Ada
.
<EOS>
“Ada
<EOS>
,
”
he
said
,
“
be
not
deceived
—
the
voice
you
heard
calling
upon
youwas
not
that
of
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
.
<EOS>
That
name
was
assumed
merely
todeceive
you
to
your
destruction
.
<EOS>
You
,
as
well
as
I
,
have
escaped
agreat
danger
—
so
great
a
danger
,
that
I
shall
hasten
my
departure
fromEngland
,
and
you
may
rest
assured
now
that
within
one
month
of
time
youwill
be
rich
and
free
.
”“Indeed
!
”
<EOS>
said
Ada
,
incredulously
.
<EOS>
“You
may
believe
me
,
”
said
Gray
;
“
on
my
faith
,
what
I
say
is
true
.
<EOS>
”“’Tis
<EOS>
hard
to
believe
him
who
would
murder
one
moment
,
and
promisewealth
and
freedom
the
next
.
<EOS>
”“I
was
forced
to
threaten
your
life
,
Ada
,
for
my
own
,
as
I
tell
you
,
hung
upon
a
thread
;
you
will
not
repent
this
day
’s
proceedings
when
youare
happy
with
him
you
love
,
and
surrounded
by
luxury
.
<EOS>
”Ada
started
;
and
had
there
been
light
enough
in
that
dismal
place
.
<EOS>
Graywould
have
seen
the
mantling
flash
of
colour
that
visited
the
cheek
ofthe
persecuted
girl
,
as
the
words
he
spoke
conjured
up
a
dream
ofhappiness
to
her
imagination
,
that
she
felt
would
indeed
pay
her
forall
<EOS>
she
had
suffered
—
ay
,
were
it
ten
times
more
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
speak
,
forshe
would
not
let
Jacob
Gray
guess
,
from
the
agitation
of
her
voice
,
the
effect
that
his
words
had
produced
,
and
after
a
pause
he
said
toher,—“Remain
here
while
I
go
into
the
house
and
see
that
all
is
safe
.
<EOS>
Theymust
be
gone
by
this
time
,
Jacob
Gray
has
foiled
them
once
again
,
buthe
will
not
incur
the
danger
a
third
time
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
Ada
,
as
I
liveand
breathe
your
thraldom
shall
not
—
<EOS>
cannot
last
another
month
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
ascended
the
ladder
as
he
spoke
,
and
after
listening
attentively
andhearing
nothing
,
he
slid
open
the
panel
and
looked
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
Allwas
still
,
and
the
glorious
bright
sunshine
was
streaming
in
upon
thedingy
walls
and
blackened
floor
.
<EOS>
Again
Gray
listened
—
all
was
still
,
and
he
got
through
the
opening
witha
lurking
smile
of
gratified
cunning
upon
his
face
.
<EOS>
He
,
however
,
couldnot
forget
his
habitual
caution
,
and
it
was
with
a
slinking
,
cat
-
likemovement
that
he
walked
along
the
floor
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
intended
to
walk
through
the
entire
house
,
to
see
if
his
unwelcomevisitors
had
left
behind
them
any
traces
of
their
presence
.
<EOS>
Opening
thedoor
of
the
room
,
very
carefully
,
he
began
to
descend
the
stairs
;
hemuttered
to
himself
as
he
went,—“’Twas
an
hour
of
great
danger
,
I
have
been
saved
by
what
good
andpious
people
would
call
a
miracle
,
<EOS>
had
it
happened
to
them
,
but
Isuppose
<EOS>
it
’s
merely
an
accident
in
Jacob
Gray
’s
case
;
well
,
well
,
be
itso
—
accident
or
miracle
,
’
tis
all
the
same
to
me
;
and
I
am
not
sorrytoo
,
to
leave
this
old
house
:
it
has
grown
hateful
and
loathsome
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
pass
such
another
night
in
it
as
I
have
passed
for
—
for
—
muchmoney
.
<EOS>
No
,
no
—
it
would
indeed
require
a
heap
of
gold
to
tempt
me
.
<EOS>
”Now
<EOS>
he
reached
the
door
of
a
large
cupboard
on
the
staircase
,
which
waswide
open
,
as
Sir
Francis
and
his
men
had
left
it
in
the
course
oftheir
search
.
<EOS>
“So
,
”
sneered
Gray
,
“
<EOS>
they
have
looked
for
me
in
the
cupboards
,
havethey
?
<EOS>
Well
,
the
keener
the
search
has
been
,
the
better
;
it
is
lesslikely
to
be
renewed
,
far
less
likely
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
think
of
any
planof
vengeance
upon
this
magistrate
,
for
the
misery
he
has
caused
me
;
<EOS>
oh
,
if
I
could
inflict
upon
him
but
one
tithe
of
the
agony
he
has
made
mesuffer
within
the
last
hour
,
I
should
be
much
rejoiced
.
<EOS>
Curses
onhim
—
curses
on
him
and
his
efficiency
as
a
magistrate
:
<EOS>
a
meddling
cursedfiend
he
is
to
me
<EOS>
—
I
must
think
,
Master
Hartleton
;
some
little
plan
ofrevenge
upon
you
may
suggest
itself
to
me
by
-
and
-
by?“Jacob
Gray
rubbed
his
hands
together
,
and
gave
a
sickly
smile
,
as
hesaid
this
.
<EOS>
He
was
about
the
middle
of
the
staircase
,
and
it
wasfortunate
for
him
he
had
his
hands
on
the
banisters
,
or
in
the
intensehorror
and
surprise
that
suddenly
overcame
him
,
he
might
have
fallendown
the
remaining
portion
of
the
crazy
stairs
.
<EOS>
He
heard
a
door
open
,
leading
into
the
passage
,
from
one
of
the
lowerrooms
,
and
a
heavy
careless
step
rapidly
approached
the
staircase
,
while
a
common
street
melody
,
whistled
with
a
shrillness
anddistinctness
that
was
more
horrible
to
Jacob
Gray
than
would
have
beenthe
trumpet
of
the
angel
at
the
day
of
judgment
,
fell
upon
his
ears
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
gave
himself
up
for
lost
.
<EOS>
The
blood
rushed
to
his
heart
withfrightful
violence
,
and
he
thought
he
should
have
fainted
.
<EOS>
How
heaccomplished
the
feat
he
afterwards
knew
not
,
but
he
stepped
back
.
<EOS>
Twopaces
brought
him
to
the
cupboard
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
like
the
door
of
heavenopened
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
doubled
himself
up
under
a
large
shelf
that
wentacross
the
middle
of
it
;
and
clutching
the
door
by
a
small
rim
of
thepanelling
,
he
drew
it
close
.
<EOS>
Mr
.
<EOS>
Elias
,
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
and
whistling
the
beforementioned
popular
melody
,
passed
on
up
the
staircase
,
leaving
JacobGray
almost
distilled
to
a
jelly
with
fear
.
<EOS>
Then
,
when
he
had
passed
,
Gray
thought
at
first
that
his
best
planwould
be
to
rush
down
the
stairs
,
open
the
outer
door
,
and
make
a
rushacross
the
fields
,
leaving
Ada
to
her
destiny
—
but
this
was
hazardous
—
hewould
be
seen
—
hunted
like
a
wild
beast
;
and
taken
!
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
That
was
toobold
a
step
for
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
He
listened
,
with
heart
and
soul
,
to
thefootsteps
that
sounded
so
awful
in
his
ears
,
and
the
question
arose
inhis
mind
,
of
—
should
the
man
,
whoever
he
was
,
enter
the
room
where
heJacob
Gray
,
had
just
left
,
so
heedlessly
as
he
now
thought
,
with
thepanel
open
,
or
would
he
pass
on
?
<EOS>
That
was
a
fearful
question
.
<EOS>
Hethought
he
heard
him
pause
once
,
and
his
heart
sunk
within
him
.
<EOS>
No
,
hepassed
on

He
was

CHAPTER
XLVI.The
<EOS>
Death
of
the
Elder
<EOS>
Seyton.—Albert
’s
<EOS>
Grief.—The
Prophecy
.
<EOS>
It
is
necessary
now
that
we
should
,
although
unwillingly
,
leave
thefortunes
of
the
beautiful
and
persecuted
Ada
to
proceed
by
themselvesfor
a
short
space
,
while
we
acquaint
the
reader
with
what
the
otherimportant
personages
in
our
story
have
been
and
are
about
.
<EOS>
First
,
we
will
turn
to
Albert
Seyton
,
who
,
with
his
father
,
returnedfrom
the
office
of
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
rather
dispirited
thanotherwise
at
the
result
of
the
interview
with
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
that
Albert
reasoned
with
himself
on
the
folly
of
hishaving
had
any
immediate
expectations
of
news
of
Ada
through
theinterposition
of
the
magistrate
.
<EOS>
He
did
feel
depressed
anddisappointed
,
and
the
words
indicative
of
the
difficulty
that
envelopedthe
business
which
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
had
used
made
a
far
greaterimpression
upon
the
mind
of
Albert
than
anything
else
that
hadtranspired
at
the
interview
.
<EOS>
Had
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
not
been
a
magistrate
,
but
a
mere
privategentleman
,
knowing
what
he
did
,
and
suspecting
what
he
did
,
in
allprobability
the
interview
with
the
Seytons
would
have
been
moresatisfactory
to
them
,
and
more
productive
of
beneficial
results
to
Ada;but
<EOS>
as
it
was
,
Sir
Francis
felt
that
,
in
his
official
capacity
,
hecould
not
be
too
cautious
as
to
what
he
said
,
or
what
opinion
hesuggested
,
in
any
criminal
undertaking
.
<EOS>
Thus
he
did
not
(
and
so
far
hewas
quite
correct
)
feel
himself
justified
in
mentioning
the
name
ofLearmont
,
unless
the
Seytons
had
heard
it
previously
,
in
connexion
withany
of
the
mysterious
circumstances
surrounding
Ada
.
<EOS>
As
yet
all
was
mere
suspicion
;
and
there
was
no
direct
evidence
onwhich
to
found
an
open
accusation
against
the
acts
of
Squire
Learmont;for
although
he
,
Sir
Francis
,
by
putting
together
all
the
circumstancesin
his
own
mind
,
felt
morally
convinced
that
there
had
been
some
greatcrime
committed
,
in
which
Learmont
,
Britton
the
smith
,
the
man
Gray
,
and
possibly
others
were
implicated
,
still
the
evidence
of
that
crimewere
to
be
sought
;
and
it
would
have
been
highly
inconsistent
with
him
,
Sir
Francis
,
as
a
magistrate
,
to
have
brought
a
loose
andunsubstantiated
charge
against
any
one
—
much
less
<EOS>
a
man
with
whom
itcould
be
easily
proved
he
had
previously
quarrelled
,
and
who
might
,
bythe
very
indiscretion
of
making
an
improper
charge
against
,
be
so
farput
upon
his
caution
,
as
to
succeed
in
effectually
destroying
allevidence
that
could
ever
militate
against
him
.
<EOS>
Taking
,
therefore
,
this
view
of
the
case
,
and
being
satisfied
that
theSeytons
had
communicated
to
him
all
they
knew
;
and
having
their
promiseto
bring
him
any
fresh
information
they
might
become
possessed
of
,
heresolved
to
prosecute
the
matter
quietly
and
cautiously
,
until
,
bygetting
some
of
the
parties
in
his
hands
,
he
would
be
able
to
puttogether
something
distinct
in
the
shape
of
a
charge
against
Learmont
,
or
ascertain
his
innocence
.
<EOS>
The
magistrate
had
seen
much
of
human
nature
,
and
he
very
soon
came
tothe
conclusion
,
in
his
own
mind
,
that
brave
,
ardent
,
and
enthusiasticas
Albert
Seyton
was
,
he
would
be
very
far
from
an
efficient
assistantin
a
matter
that
required
the
utmost
coolness
,
caution
,
and
finesse
.
<EOS>
Thus
it
was
that
he
acted
entirely
independent
of
Albert
,
and
said
aslittle
to
him
as
he
could
upon
the
subject
,
at
the
same
time
that
he
,
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
would
not
have
lost
a
moment
in
communicatingwith
Albert
,
had
any
discovery
really
taken
place
at
the
old
house
atBattersea
.
<EOS>
While
all
this
was
going
on
,
Albert
Seyton
pursued
his
inquiries
,
although
with
a
languid
spirit
,
for
there
was
no
place
he
had
notalready
several
times
visited
.
<EOS>
Twice
or
thrice
he
had
actually
lookedat
the
house
in
which
Ada
was
a
prisoner
,
and
once
he
thought
ofcrossing
the
fields
from
curiosity
to
visit
it
,
but
was
told
that
itwas
in
ruins
,
and
in
fact
dangerous
to
approach
,
as
it
was
expected
tofall
to
the
ground
very
shortly
;
and
considering
it
as
a
most
unlikelyplace
to
search
in
,
standing
as
it
did
so
very
much
exposed
toobservation
in
its
situation
,
he
abandoned
the
notion
of
crossing
themarshy
fields
to
the
old
ruin
.
<EOS>
Pale
and
languid
,
he
would
return
to
his
father
in
the
evening
,
and
itwas
some
time
before
he
noticed
that
there
were
perceptible
signs
<EOS>
ofrapid
decay
creeping
over
the
only
earthly
tie
he
had
,
save
Ada
.
<EOS>
In
truth
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Seyton
was
near
that
bourne
from
whence
<EOS>
no
travellerreturns
,
and
in
the
midst
of
his
other
griefs
,
the
absorbing
one
sprangup
,
of
the
loss
of
his
father
.
<EOS>
Every
other
consideration
was
now
abandoned
by
Albert
in
his
anxioussolicitude
for
his
father
’s
health
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
,
however
,
that
a
rapiddecay
of
nature
was
taking
place
,
and
in
less
than
three
days
<EOS>
Mr
.
<EOS>
Seyton
lay
at
the
point
of
death
.
<EOS>
Medical
advice
was
of
no
avail
;
thephysician
who
was
called
in
declared
that
neither
he
nor
any
of
hisbrethren
could
do
anything
in
the
case
.
<EOS>
There
,
was
no
disease
tograpple
with
—
it
seemed
as
if
nature
had
said
,
“
the
time
of
dissolutionhas
come
,
and
it
may
not
be
averted
.
<EOS>
”It
was
early
dawn
,
and
the
stillness
that
reigned
throughout
London
hadsomething
awful
and
yet
sublime
in
it
,
when
Albert
,
who
had
beenwatching
by
the
bedside
of
his
father
,
was
roused
from
a
slight
slumberinto
which
,
from
pure
exhaustion
,
he
had
sunk
,
by
the
low
,
faint
voiceof
<EOS>
his
dying
parent
feebly
pronouncing
his
name
.
<EOS>
“Albert
,
Albert
!
”
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
Albert
started
,
and
replied
to
his
father
.
<EOS>
“Yes
,
father
,
I
am
here
.
<EOS>
”“You
are
here
,
my
boy
,
and
you
will
remain
here
many
years

not

<EOS>
”“Father
<EOS>
,
say
not
so
,
”
replied
Albert
,
endeavouring
to
assume
a
tone
<EOS>
ofcheerfulness
<EOS>
that
was
foreign
to
his
feelings
.
<EOS>
“
Say
not
so
;
we
may
yetbe
together
many
years

”“Albert

not
try
to
delude
me
and

with
false

<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>

<EOS>
”“They
are
my
last
words

Albert
,

it
is
said
that
when

to
quit
its

and
is
hovering
,
as
it

uponthe
confines
of
eternity

it
is
permitted
to
see
things
that
in
itsgrosser
state
were
far
above
its

,
and
even
to
obtain
some
dimglimpse

so
that

<EOS>
”Albert
listened
with
eager
attention
to
his
father
’s
words
;
and
itseemed
to
him
as
if
there
were
something
of
heavenly
inspiration
in
histones
.
<EOS>
After
a
pause
,
Mr.
Seyton
continued,—“Albert
,
for
two
days
now
I
have
known
no
peace
on
your
account,—”“On
my
account

father?”“Yes

Albert

<EOS>
By
my
death

the
pension
which
my
just
claims
have
wrungfrom
the

I
suffered
so
much

have
not
enjoyed
it

”“Think
<EOS>
not
of
me
now

said
Albert
;
“
dismiss
all

”“Listen
<EOS>
to
me
,
Albert
.
<EOS>
I
say
I
have
suffered
much
on
your
account

because
the
thought
haunted
me
that
I
was
leaving
you
to

cold

selfish
,
and
too

too
frequently

that

by

mysterious

has
left
me

”“Indeed
<EOS>
,
father?”“Yes
,
a
kind
of
confidence
—
surely
from
Heaven
—
has
crept
over
my
heartconcerning
you

,
without
knowing
how

I
seem
to
have
a
deepand

said
Albert
,
“
for

If

”“Father

“Nay

bitterly

“Nay

”Mr

<EOS>
Seyton
was
now
silent
for
many
minutes
;
and
Albert
,
by
the
rapidlyincreasing
light
of
the
coming
day
,
watched
with
painful
interest
thegreat
change
that
was
passing
over
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
“Father

”
he
murmured
.
<EOS>
“Yes

I
am
here
still

was
the
reply
.
<EOS>
“You
are
in
pain?”“No

no

<EOS>
Bless
you
,
my

sobbed
convulsively
,
and
took
his
father
’s
hand
in
his—“And
bless
you
too

Ada

”
added
Mr.
Seyton
,
after
a
pause
.
<EOS>
Then
heseemed
to
imagine
she
was
present
,
for
he
said,—“You
love

<EOS>
Blessings
on

very

”Albert
was
deeply
affected
by
these
words
,
and
in
vain
he
endeavouredto
stifle
his
sobs
.
<EOS>
“Albert
!
”
said
his
father
,
suddenly
.
<EOS>
“Yes
,
father
,
I
am
here

he
replied
.
<EOS>
“Do

recollect

”“She

was
one
long

drawn
sigh
,
and
the
kind

hearted
,
noble
Mr.
Seytonwas
with
his
God
.
<EOS>
It
was
some
moments
before
Albert
could
bring
himself
to
believe
thathis
father
was
no
more
;
and
then
,
with
a
frantic
burst
of
grief
,
hecalled
around
him
the
persons
of
the
house
,
who
with
gentle
violencetook
him
from
the
chamber
of
death
,
and
strove
to
soothe
his
deep
griefwith
such
topics
of
consolation
as
suggested
themselves
to
them
.
<EOS>
Butpoor
Albert
heard
nothing
of

sympathy

<EOS>
His
grief
wasoverwhelming
;
and
it
was
many
hours
before
his
deep
agony
subsided
intotears
,
and
the
last
words
of
his
father
came
like
balm
to
his
woundedspirit
.
<EOS>
Then
his
grief
assumed
a
more
calm
and
melancholy
aspect
.
<EOS>
He
shed
nomore
tears
;
but
there
was
a
weight
at
his
heart
which
even
the
brightand
<EOS>
strangely
earnest
prophecies
of

concerning

,
could
not

CHAPTER
XLVII.The
Smith
at
Learmont
<EOS>
House.—The
Breakfast.—The
Threat
,
and
itsResults.—The
Caution
.
<EOS>
While
these
events
were
taking
place
,
Learmont
was
ill
at
ease
in
hisstately
halls
.
<EOS>
Well
he
knew
that
the
visitation
of
the
smith
at
soinopportune
an
hour
at
his
fête
would
be
related
throughout
that
circleof
nobility
and
power
into
which
it
was
the
grand
end
and
aim
of
hislife
to
force
himself
;
and
,
it
added
one
more
damning
argument
to
thosealready
rapidly
accumulating
in
his
mind
towards
the
conviction
,
thatafter
all
he
had
made
a
grand
mistake
in
life
,
and
mistaken
the
road
tohappiness
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
however
,
he
felt
that
having
chosen
thepath
of
guilt
he
had
,
there
was
for
him
no
retreat
,
and
with
a
doggedperseverance
,
compounded
of
mortified
ambition
,
he
continued
his
careerof
guilt
.
<EOS>
Take
the
life
of
Britton
<EOS>
he
dared
not
,
although
he
lay
such
aninanimate
,
helpless
mass
in
his
power
,
and
it
was
not
the
least
ofLearmont
’s
annoyances
that
he
was
compelled
to
see
to
the
personalsafety
of
the
drunken
brute
who
had
produced
confusion
and
derangementamong
his
most
ambitious
schemes
.
<EOS>
It
was
many
hours
before
Britton
slept
off
the
intoxication
under
theinfluence
of
which
he
had
acted
in
the
manner
described
in
theball
-
room
,
and
when
he
did
recover
,
and
open
his
heavy
eyes
,
it
waswith
no
small
degree
of
surprise
that
he
found
himself
in
the
same
darkroom
into
which
the
squire
had
thrown
him
to
sleep
off
his
debauch
.
<EOS>
His
first
thought
was
that
he
was
in
prison
,
and
he
rose
to
his
feetwith
bitter
imprecations
and
awful
curses
upon
the
head
of
Learmont
andGray
,
whom
he
supposed
must
have
betrayed
him
in
some
way
.
<EOS>
A
secondthought
,
however
,
dispelled
this
delusion
.
<EOS>
“No
—
<EOS>
no
;
d
—
<EOS>
n
them
—
<EOS>
no
!
”
<EOS>
he
cried
.
<EOS>
“
They
dare
not
!
<EOS>
Well
they
know
theydare
<EOS>
not!—I
have
them
<EOS>
safe!—My
evidence
would
destroy
them
,
while
itwould
not
place
me
in
a
worse
position
.
<EOS>
Where
the
devil
am
I?”The
room
was
very
dark
,
<EOS>
the
only
light
coming
from
a
small
pane
ofglass
at
the
top
of
the
door
.
<EOS>
Britton
,
however
,
was
not
exactly
thekind
of
person
to
waste
much
time
in
idle
conjecture
or
imaginativetheories
as
to
where
he
was
;
but
,
ascertaining
that
the
door
waslocked
,
he
placed
his
shoulder
against
it
and
with
one
heave
of
hisbulky
form
,
forced
it
from
its
hinges
.
<EOS>
A
loud
cry
arrested
the
smith
’s
attention
as
he
accomplished
this
feat
,
and
,
to
his
great
amusement
,
he
saw
lying
amid
the
confusion
of
a
tray
,
glasses
,
and
decanters
,
a
man
who
happened
to
have
been
passing
at
themoment
,
and
,
alarmed
at
the
sudden
and
violent
appearance
of
the
smith
,
had
fallen
down
with
what
he
was
so
carefully
carrying
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
piece
of
sport
quite
in
Britton
’s
way
—
one
of
those
practicaljests
that
he
perfectly
understood
and
appreciated
,
in
order
,
however
,
to
add
zest
to
it
,
he
gave
the
astonished
man
a
hearty
kick
,
whichinduced
him
to
spring
to
his
feet
,
and
make
off
with
frantic
speed
,
shouting
“
Murder
!
<EOS>
Murder
!
”
<EOS>
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
.
<EOS>
Britton
immediately
turned
his
attention
to
one
decanter
which
,
in
amost
miraculous
and
extraordinary
manner
,
preserved
its
position
ofperpendicularity
amidst
the
universal
wreck
of
every
other
article
.
<EOS>
Heseized
it
instantly
as
a
lawful
prize
,
and
plunging
the
neck
of
it
intohis
capacious
mouth
,
he
withdrew
it
not
again
until
it
presented
anappearance
of
perfect
vacuity
,
and
the
bottle
of
wine
which
it
hadcontained
was
transferred
into
his
interior
man
.
<EOS>
“That
<EOS>
’s
good
,
”
gasped
Britton
,
when
he
had
finished
his
draught
,
“
<EOS>
I
wasthirsty
.
<EOS>
Upon
my
life
that
’s
good
.
<EOS>
Curse
the
awkward
fellow
!
<EOS>
He

I

<EOS>
This

<EOS>

now
I
look
about
me
.
<EOS>
I
must
have
been
drunk
.
<EOS>
What
the

happened

<EOS>
My
head
is
all
of
a
twirl

<EOS>
Let

<EOS>
TheChequers

<EOS>

<EOS>
I
ca

but
the
Chequers
.
<EOS>
”Britton
<EOS>
’s
<EOS>
cogitations
were
here
interrupted
by
the
appearance
ofLearmont
with
a
dark
scowl
on
his
brow
that
would
have
alarmed
any
onebut
the
iron
-
nerved
and
audacious
Britton
.
<EOS>
“Well
<EOS>
,
squire
<EOS>
,
”
he
said
,
“
I
suppose
I
’d
a
drop
too
much
,
and
you
tookcare
of
me
,
eh
?
<EOS>
Is
that
it?”“Follow
—
me
!
”
<EOS>
said
Learmont
,
bringing
out
the
two
words
through
hisclenched
teeth
,
and
making
a
great
effort
to
preserve
himself
frombursting
out
into
a
torrent
of
invective
.
<EOS>
“Follow
you
?
”
exclaimed
Britton
.
<EOS>
“
Well
I
have
no
objection
;
I
’ll
followyou
.
<EOS>
Our
business
is
always
quite
private
and
confidential
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
followed
the
rapid
strides
of
Learmont
along
a
long
gallery
,
duringthe
progress
of
which
they
encountered
a
servant
,
when
Brittonimmediately
paused
,
and
roared
out
in
a
voice
that
made
the
man
standlike
one
possessed,—“Hark
,
ye
knave!—You
in
the
tawny

”“Andrew
<EOS>
Britton
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Learmont
,
turning
full
upon
the
smith
,
flashingwith
resentment
.
<EOS>
“Squire
Learmont
!
”
<EOS>
replied
Britton
,
facing
him
with
an
air
of
insolenceand
bloated
assurance
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
pause
for
a
moment
,
and
<EOS>
then
Learmont
added,—“You
—
you
are
still
drunk!”“No
,
I
am
hungry
;
a
drunken
man
never
orders
victuals
,
squire
.
<EOS>
”“I
have
breakfasted
,
”
said
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“Very
<EOS>
like
,
but
you
do
n’t
fancy
I
meant
any
of
it
for
you
.
<EOS>
Curse
me
!
<EOS>
Ialways
make
a
point
of
ordering
breakfast
for
two
,
now
that
I
am
agentleman
and
can
afford
it;—I’m
sure
to
have
nearly
enough
then
.
<EOS>
Breakfast
for
two
,
I
say
!
<EOS>
You
can
get
it
ready
while
your
master
and
Isettle
some
little
affairs
connected
with
the
Old
Smithy
.
<EOS>
Do
youhear?—What
are
you
staring
at?”The
<EOS>
servant
looked
at
Learmont
evidently
for
orders
,
and
the
squire
,
almost
inarticulate
with
rage
,
said,—“Go
—
go
!
<EOS>
You
may
get
him
breakfast
.
”“Ah
,
to
be
sure
,
”
said
Britton
;
<EOS>
“
of
course
you
may
.
<EOS>
I
’m
a
particularfriend
of
your
master
’s
;
and
mind
you
are
more
respectful
another
time
,
you
beast
,
and
use
polite
language
,
and
be
d
—
d
to
you
,
you
<EOS>
thief!”The
amazed
domestic
hastened
away
,
for
he
shrewdly
guessed
that
,
if
hedelayed
much
longer
,
he
might
be
favoured
by
some
practical
display
ofthe
excessive
freedom
which
the
messenger
from
the
Old
Smithy
evidentlycould
take
with
the
proud
,
haughty
,
Learmont
,
and
everything
that
washis
,
or
in
any
way
connected
with
him
—
a
freedom
which
puzzled
<EOS>
andamazed
the
whole
household
,
and
formed
the
theme
of
such
endlessgossipping
in
the
servants
’
hall
,
that
without
it
,
it
would
seemimpossible
they
could
found
any
materials
for
consideration
,
conjecture
,
and
endless
surmise
.
<EOS>
Learmont
now
stalked
on
,
followed
by
Britton
,
until
he
reached
thesmall
private
room
in
which
the
conferences
with
both
Gray
and
thesmith
were
usually
held
.
<EOS>
The
squire
then
closed
the
door
,
and
turningto
Britton
with
a
face
convulsed
with
passion
,
he
said,—“Scoundrel
!
<EOS>
Are
you
not
afraid
to
tamper
with
me
in
this
manner
?
<EOS>
Driveme
too
far
by
your
disgusting
conduct
,
and
insolent
,
vulgarfamiliarities
,
and
<EOS>
I
would
hang
you
,
though
I
had
to
fly
from
Englandforever
before
I
denounced
you;—nay
,
hear
me
out
,
and
let
my
words
sinkdeep
into
your
brain
,
if
it
be
capable
of
receiving
and
recording
them
.
<EOS>
If
you
dare
to
thrall
me
by
untimely
visits
,
I
will
,
though
it
cost
methousands
,
lay
such
a
plot
for
your
destruction
,
that
your
life
shallnot
only
be
forfeited
,
but
I
will
take
care
to
associate
your
name
withsuch
infamy
that
no
confession
nor
statement
of
yours
would
be
receivedwith
a

<EOS>
’s
credence
.
<EOS>
You
earn
from
me
the
wages
of
crime
—
deepcrime
,
and
you
know
it
;
but
were
those
wages
millions
,

were
thosecrimes
of
ten
times
blacker

than
they
are

no

<EOS>
I
am
your

I
will
make
youknow

or
rue
the
fearful
consequence

<EOS>
”Learmont
<EOS>
paused
,
and
regarded
the
smith
with
an
air
of
haughty
defiance
.
<EOS>
“Oh
!
”
said
Britton
.
<EOS>
“
So
you
’ve
had
your
say

Squire

Ho

You

I

Idon’t

then
you

there
’s
an

Now

I

I

made
an
ass

<EOS>
I
came
here

now
I
recollect

with
a
good
motive,—it

But

<EOS>
took
out
the
sum
required
from
his
purse
,

handed
it
toBritton

saying
as
he
did
so,—“And

”A

low

at

now
announced
some

went

”CHAPTER
<EOS>
XLVIII.The
<EOS>
Escape.—A
Song
of
the
Times
.
<EOS>
It
was
several
minutes
after
Gray
felt
perfectly
assured
that
the
man
,
whoever
he
was
,
that
had
passed
whistling
by
the
cupboard
door
,
hadgone
up
to
the
highest
story
of
the
house
before
he
could
summoncourage
to
leave
his
temporary
hiding
-
place
.
<EOS>
The
urgent
necessity
,
however
,
of
doing
so
while
there
was
an
opportunity
came
so
forciblyupon
<EOS>
his
terror
-
stricken
mind
,
that
although
he
trembled
so
excessivelyas
to
be
forced
to
cling
to
the
banisters
for
support
,
he
crawled
fromthe
place
of
shelter
which
had
presented
itself
so
providentially
tohim
in
such
a
moment
of
extremity
,
and
treading
as
lightly
as
he
could
,
while
his
whole
frame
was
nearly
paralysed
by
fear
,
he
succeeded
inreaching
the
room
from
which
opened
the
small
aperture
to
the
vaultwhere
Ada
awaited
his
coming
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
’s
mind
at
this
moment
embraced
but
one
idea
,
indulged
in
butone
hope
,
and
that
was
to
reach
the
vault
in
safety
,
and
close
theopening
in
the
wall
which
had
already
escaped
the
scrutiny
of
SirFrederick
Hartleton
.
<EOS>
The
extreme
caution
that
he
thought
himself
compelled
to
use
in
hismovements
made
him
slow
in
attaining
his
object
,
and
each
momentappeared
an
age
of
anxiety
and
awful
suffering
.
<EOS>
Now
he
mounted
the
chair
,
and
as
he
did
so
he
heard
,
or
fancied
heheard
,
the
descending
footsteps
of
the
stranger
as
he
came
from
theupper
story
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
then
trembled
so
excessively
that
he
couldscarcely
contrive
to
put
himself
through
the
small
panelled
opening
andwhen
he
did
,
his
anxiety
was
so
great
and
<EOS>
his
nervousness
so
intense
,
that
it
was
several
moments
before
he
could
place
his
foot
securelyupon
one
of
the
rounds
of
the
ladder
.
<EOS>
The
shrill
whistle
of
the
man
now
sounded
awfully
distinct
in
his
ears
,
and
he
fancied
that
he
must
have
closed
the
panel
scarcely
an
instantbefore
the
stranger
entered
the
apartment
.
<EOS>
Then
Jacob
Gray
laid
his
ear
flatly
against
the
wainscot
to
listen
ifmore
than
one
person
was
in
the
room
,
and
gather
from
any
conversationthey
might
indulge
in
what
were
their
objects
and
expectations
inremaining
so
long
in
the
ancient
and
dilapidated
house
.
<EOS>
For
some
minutes
the
whistling
continued
,
for
that
was
an
innocentamusement
that
Mr.
Elias
was
fortunately
partial
to
,
and
one
to
whichhe
invariably
resorted
when
anything
of
a
disagreeable
characterabsorbed
his
mind
;
and
as
now
he
could
not
withdraw
his
thoughts
fromthe
fact
that
he
must
fast
until
sunset
<EOS>
,
he
whistled
with
an
energy
anda
desperation
<EOS>
proportioned
to
the
exigency
of
the
case
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
however
,
from
want
of
breath
,
or
that
he
had
gone
throughevery
tune
he
was
acquainted
with
three
times
,
he
paused
in
hiswhistling
,
and
uttered
the
simple
and
energetic
apostrophe
of,—“Well
<EOS>
,
I
’m
d
—
<EOS>
d!”This
did
not
convey
a
great
deal
of
information
to
Jacob
Gray
,
and
hewaited
very
anxiously
to
hear
what
further
remarks
concerning
histhoughts
and
objects
in
this
world
might
fall
from
the
speaker
who
hadso
cavalierly
and
off
handedly
settled
his
destination
in
the
next
.
<EOS>
Norwas
he
disappointed
,
for
Mr.
Elias
,
having
no
one
to
talk
to
,
addressedhimself
,
in
the
following
strains:—“Well
,
here
’s
a
precious
old
crib
to
be
shut
up
in
.
<EOS>
Upon
my
soul
,

<EOS>
And
no

no

<EOS>
How
would
he
like
it
<EOS>
,
I
wonder
?
<EOS>
Why
,
not
at
all
,
to
besure
.
<EOS>
The
fifty
pounds
is
something
—
but
<EOS>
it
’s
all
moonshine

Stephy

,
if

makes
it
very
late
afore
<EOS>
he
comes

<EOS>
Curse
this
place
,
it
’s
<EOS>
as
dull
as
a
sermon
,
and
about
as
pleasant
and
lively

looking
asmud

<EOS>
I
do
n’t
like
these
kind
of

<EOS>
Give

and
a
hunt
after
such
a
rollicking

slashing
blade
as
JackSheppard

<EOS>
Ah

the
fellow
for

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
He

too
,
like

nightingales

<EOS>
Shall
I
everhear
him
sing
that
song
again
as
I
learnt
of
him
by
listening
to
him
inquod
,
and
all
the
while
as
I
was
taken
up
with
the
tune
,
he
was
afiling
away
at
his
darbies
,
bless
him
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
he
’s
<EOS>
a
rum
un!”Elias
then
delighted
himself
and
astonished
Jacob
Gray
,
by
singing
thefollowing
song
;
which
was
in
great
vogue
at
the
time:—What
Knight
<EOS>
’s
<EOS>
Like
the
Knight
of
the
Road?“What
knight
’s
like
the
knight
of
the
road?Who
lives
so
well
as
he?The
proudest
duke
do
n’t
leadA
life
so
brave
and
free
.
<EOS>
Heighho
!
<EOS>
How
the
maidens
sigh
,
As
he
dashes
proudly
by!And
there
’s
not
a
gentle
heart
of
all
—
Let
weal
or
woe
betide
—
That
would
not
leap
with
dear
delightTo
be
his
happy
bride
.
<EOS>
“The
day
goes
down
on
Hounslow
-
heath
,
The
night
wind
sighs
amain;Hurrah
!
<EOS>
Hurrah
,
for

road!For
now
begins
his
reign

<EOS>
Heighho
!

How
the
ladies
cry
,
As
they
see
his
flashing
eye

<EOS>
And
there
’s
not
a
pair
of
cherry
lips
,
Of
high

Would
scorn
a

Who
’s

’s

”As
<EOS>
Mr.
Elias
,
between
the
stanzas
of
his
song
,
whistled
anaccompaniment
,
in
which
there
were
a
great
number
of
shakes
,
trills
,
and
what
musicians
call
variations
which
means
something
which
is
notat
all
connected
with
the
tune
,
the
whole
affair
took
some
considerabletime
in
execution
;
and
Jacob
Gray
stood
upon
the
ladder
in
a
perfectagony
of
annoyance
until
it
was
over
.
<EOS>
“Bravo
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Elias
,
when
he
had

Curse

em!”Having
uttered
this
sentiment
,
Mr.
Elias
struck
up
an
intense
whistle
,
and
walked
from
the
room
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
could
hear
him
descend
the
stairs
,
and
the
whistle
graduallydied
away
in
the
distance
,
until
it
sounded
only
faintly
upon
his
ears
,
convincing
him
that
the
stranger
had
gone
into
some
of
the
rooms
on
theground
floor
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
now
slowly
descended
the
ladder
,
and
pronounced
the
name
ofAda
in
a
low
,
anxious
tone
.
<EOS>
“I
am
here
,
”
she
replied
.
<EOS>
“Ada
,
our
situation
is
now
perilous
and
awkward
in
the
extreme

<EOS>
Thepersons
who
were

left
one
of

behind

<EOS>
”“Indeed!”“Yes

they
suspect
I
may
return

<EOS>
”“Are
we
then
to
starve
here
?
”
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“Starved
?
”
echoed
Gray
,
“
I
—
<EOS>
I
did
not
think
of
that

<EOS>
God

<EOS>
Whatshall

said
Ada
,
“
you
are
caught
in
your

<EOS>
This

”“You

murder

replied
Ada
,
“

not

”Gray
was
silent
for
several
moments
after
Ada
had
spoken
.
<EOS>
Then
bendingdown
his
mouth
,
close
to
her
ear
,
he
said
in
a
low
,
agitated
voice,—“Ada
—
there
is
another

”“Indeed?”“Yes

mean
you

the

”“It

Gray

<EOS>
“You

<EOS>
He
is
walking
uneasily
from
room
to
room
of
the
house

<EOS>
He
does
not
suspect
any
one
to
be
concealed
here

At

”“What

<EOS>
cried
Ada
indignantly—“murder

<EOS>
Ada
was
so
much
shocked
at
the
proposal
of
Jacob
Gray
to
commit
adeliberate
and
cold
-
blooded
murder
,
that
now
for
several
minutes
sheremained
perfectly
silent
—
a
silence
which
Gray
construed
into
passiveacquiescence
in
his
proposition
.
<EOS>
“You
see
,
<EOS>
Ada
,
”
he
continued
,
“
we

no
other
hope

<EOS>
“
In

”“You
are
wild

mad

said
Gray
,
in
a
low
tone
,
which
,
from
itsbitterness
,
was
evidently
one
of
intense
rage
likewise
.
<EOS>
“
The
fear
ofdeath
has
hitherto
acted
upon
your

let
it
so

”“It
<EOS>
was
a
sufficient

”Gray
was
evidently
unprepared
for
the
dilemma
into
which
he
had
nowbrought
himself
,
and
he
knew
not
what
to
say
for
some
moments
,
duringwhich
he
glared
upon
Ada
with
a
fiendish
expression
of
his
eyes

whichshe
could
just
discern
in
the
dim
light
of
the
cellar

,
that
was
moreworthy

malignant
demon

anything
human

<EOS>
“You

<EOS>
he
at
length
said
.
<EOS>
“No

ask
no

“

Iwill

”Jacob
<EOS>
Gray
remained
in
deep
thought
for
about
ten
minutes
;
then
,
as
hecame
to
some
conclusion
satisfactory
to
him
,
a
dark
and
singularcontortion
of
the
features
crossed
his
face
,
and
his
hand
was
thrustinto
the
breast
of
his
clothing
,
where
he
had
a
loaded
pistol
,
<EOS>
uponwhich
<EOS>
he
well
knew
he
could
depend
in
any
sudden
emergency
.
<EOS>
“Ada

”
he
said
,
“
I
am
resolved

”“Resolved
<EOS>
on

<EOS>
”“Then
I
am

said
Ada
,
“
to

a

If

<EOS>
Ada
sunk
on
her
knees
,
and
covering
her
face
within
her
hands
,
shesaid,—“Jacob

if
Heaven
permits
you
to
murder

I
will
not

<EOS>
MayGod
forgive

laughed
a
bitter
,
short
laugh
,
as
he
said,—“No

<EOS>
I
do
not

”“No

“
I

”“Listen

Gray

<EOS>
“

You

not
the

Ada

<EOS>
“Girl

are

your

destruction

<EOS>
cried
Gray
.
<EOS>
“No
<EOS>

but
;
I
know
your
nature
well

<EOS>
The
plan
you
propose
is
opposite
toyour
usual
manner

<EOS>
A
darker
scheme
possesses
you

of
whichthe
one

but
the
cloak

<EOS>
”“I
waste
time
upon
you
,
”
said
Gray
,
advancing
towards
the
ladder
.
<EOS>
He
slowly
and
cautiously
ascended
,
and
then
paused
at
the
top
step
.
<EOS>
Ada
bent
all
her
attention
to
listen
if
any
sound
came
from
the
roomabove
,
for
she
was
quite
resolved
,
let
the
consequences
to
her
be
whatthey
<EOS>
might
,
to
raise
a
cry
of
alarm
,
should
Gray
show
any
decidedsymptoms
of
carrying
out
his
project
of
murdering
the
man
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
The
few
moments
that
succeeded
were
intensely
agonising
to
Ada
,
and
herheart
beat
painfully
and
rapidly
as
she
kept
her
eye
intently
fixedupon
the
dusky
form
of
Jacob
Gray
,
as
it
was
dimly
discernible
at
thetop
of
the
ladder
.
<EOS>
This
state
of
suspense
did
not
last
long
,
for
in
avery
few
minutes
the
shrill
whistling
of
Elias
awakened
the
echoes
ofthe
old
mansion
,
and
it
was
evident
that
he
was
in
the
room
from
whichthe
panel
conducting
to
the
cellar
opened
.
<EOS>
Ada
strained
her
eyes
upwards
,
but
still
all
was
darkness
.
<EOS>
She
knewthat
<EOS>
if
Gray
were
to
remove
the
panel
,
ever
so
slightly
she
must
beaware
of
it
,
by
a
ray
of
light
streaming
through
the
aperture
;
for
thatray
of
light
Ada
waited
,
as
her
signal
to
raise
an
alarm
,
which
she
wasdetermined
to
do
.
<EOS>
Little
,
however
,
did
Ada
suspect
that
Gray
had
formed
a
plan
which
hervery
effort
to
save
the
man
on
watch
would
assist
to
carry
into
effect
.
<EOS>
Such
,
however
,
was
the
fact
.
<EOS>
Gray
fully
expected
,
and
was
quiteprepared
for
a
cry
from
Ada
,
whenever
he
should
draw
aside
the
panel
.
<EOS>
The
loud
whistling
of
Elias
still
continued
,
when
suddenly
Gray
movedthe
panel
just
sufficiently
to
allow
Ada
to
see
from
below
that
he
haddone
so
,
and
then
,
as
he
had
done
once
before
,
he
slid
down
the
ladder
,
and
,
as
Ada
thought
,
disappeared
in
the
darkness
which
shrouded
thefurther
extremity
of
the
cellar
.
<EOS>
Had
she
felt
inclined
Ada
could
nothave
stopped
herself
from
uttering
a
cry
,
and
the
instant
she
sawdaylight
through
the
panel
,
her
voice
rose
clear
and
loud—“Help
—
help
!
”
<EOS>
she
cried
“
Help
—
murder!”Mr
.
<EOS>
Elias
’s
whistling
immediately
ceased
,
although
he
was
in
the
middleof
a
very
intricate
passage
,
and
he
sprung
to
the
opening
in
the
wall
.
<EOS>
With
one
effort
he
tore
down
the
piece
of
wainscoting
and
cried
in
aloud
voice,—“Hilloa!”Ada
made
a
rush
to
the
ladder
,
but
an
arm
suddenly
arrested
herprogress
with
such
violence
that
she
fell
to
the
ground
with
greatforce
.
<EOS>
Ada
lay
for
a
moment
or
two
stunned
by
her
fall
,
and
she
heard
onlyindistinctly
the
voice
of
<EOS>
Elias
cry,—“Hilloa
!
<EOS>
Below
there
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
here
’s
a
ladder
,
is
there
?
<EOS>
Well
,
that
’s
whatI
call
providential
.
<EOS>
“Elias
was
upon
the
ladder
,
and
cautiously
descending
backwards
,
whenAda
shrieked,—“Beware!—Treachery!”Elias
paused
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Then
there
was
a
bright
flash
,
a
loud
report
,
and
a
heavy
fall
,
all
of
which
were
succeeded
by
a
silence
as
awful
andprofound
as
that
of
the
grave
.
<EOS>
Ada
rose
partially
from
the
floor
,
and
adreadful
consciousness
of
what
had
occurred
came
across
her
mind
.
<EOS>
“Jacob
Gray
,
”
she
said
,
“
you
are
a
murderer
—
a
murderer
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
—
I
was
compelled
to
do
the
deed
,
”
said
Gray
,
in
a
low
hoarse
voice
.
<EOS>
“Come
away
—
come
away
,
Ada
.
<EOS>
Let
us
fly
from
hence
—
come
away
.
<EOS>
”“Not
with
you
,
man
of
blood
,
”
cried
Ada
.
<EOS>
“
God
sees
this
deed
.
<EOS>
Murderer
,
I
can
not
go
with
you
.
<EOS>
”“’Twas
<EOS>
my
life
or
his
,
”
said
Gray
,
creeping
out
from
behind
the
ladder
,
where
he
had
been
crouching
,
and
through
the
spokes
of
which
he
hadshot
Elias
as
he
descended
with
a
certainty
of
effect
.
<EOS>
“No
—
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
Such
was
not
the
fact
,
”
cried
Ada
.
<EOS>
“I
care
not
,
”
said
Gray
,
throwing
off
his
low
cautious
tone
,
andassuming
a
high
shrill
accent
of
anger
;
“
I
care
not
.
<EOS>
Place
whatconstruction
<EOS>
you
will
upon
me

my

<EOS>
Refuse
to
accompany
me
,
and
I
willremove
the
ladder
and
leave
you
here
with
the
dead

<EOS>
”Ada
<EOS>
shuddered
.
<EOS>
“Whither
—
<EOS>
oh
whither
<EOS>
would
you
lead
me
?
”
<EOS>
she
said
.
<EOS>
“To
some
other
place
of
refuge
for
a
short
time
,
until
my
purposes
arecompleted
.
<EOS>
Be
quick
girl
,
do
you
stay
or
go?”“It
may
be
death
to
go
,
”
said
Ada
,
“
but
it
is
suicide
to
stay
.
<EOS>
”“You
consent?”“I
am
in
the
hand
of
Providence
.
<EOS>
To
it
I
commit
myself
.
<EOS>
I
will
followyou
.
”“Quick
,
quick
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Gray
,
and
he
ascended
the
ladder
with
nervoustrepidation
,
followed
slowly
by
the
afflicted
and
terrified
Ada
.
<EOS>
Theevening
was
fast
approaching
as
they
gained
the
room
above
,
and
JacobGray
,
seizing
Ada
by
the
wrist
,
led
her
to
the
outer
door
of
the
oldhouse
in
which
they
had
lived
so
long
.
<EOS>
He
turned
upon
the
threshold
,
and
holding
up
his
hand
,
cried,—“My
curse
be
upon
this
habitation
.
<EOS>
Had
I
the
means
at
hand
—
yet
stay
onemoment
,
Ada
.
”He
<EOS>
knelt
on
the
step
,
and
struck
a
light
with
materials
he
alwayscarried
about
him
.
<EOS>
Dragging
Ada
again
into
the
house
,
he
opened
the
door
of
a
room
on
theground
floor
,
on
which
was
a
quantity
of
littered
straw
and
baskets
.
<EOS>
Throwing
the
light
among
the
inflammable
material
,
he
ground
throughhis
set
teeth,—“Burn
,
burn
!
<EOS>
And
may
not
one
brick
stand
upon
another

this
hatefulplace

”He
<EOS>
then
dragged
Ada
from
the
house
,
and
took
his
course
along
thefields
at
a
rapid
pace

CHAPTER
L.The
Ruin
at
<EOS>
Night.—The
Fire.—Gray
’s
<EOS>
Behaviour.—A
Challenge.—OldWestminster
Again
.
<EOS>
Ada
made
no
remark
upon
these
proceedings
of
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
She
had
madeup
her
mind
to
a
particular
course
of
action
.
<EOS>
She
had
wound
up
herfeelings
and
her
courage
to
a
certain
pitch
and
she
resolved
not
to
sayanother
word
to
Jacob
Gray
,
until
she
had
an
opportunity
of
acting
,
asshe
had
now
considered
it
her
sacred
duty
to
act
.
<EOS>
Gray
himself
seemed
suspicious
and
annoyed
at
her
pertinacious
silence
,
and
he
addressed
her
in
a
fawning
,
trembling
voice
,
as
if
he
would
fainrestore
her
to
her
usual
confidence
in
addressing
him
.
<EOS>
The
calm
ofAda
’s
manner
alarmed
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
ten
times
rather
she
had
spoken
tohim
in
terms
of
reproach
and
abhorrence
;
but
now
that
she
said
nothing
,
he
trembled
for
what
might
be
the
nature
of
her
thoughts
regarding
him
.
<EOS>
“Ada
,
”
he
said
,
as
he
crept
along
by
her
side
,
or
rather
one
pacebefore
her
towards
the
inner
side
.
<EOS>
“
Ada
,
all
that
I
have
often
picturedto
you
of
riches
and
honour
shall
soon
be
yours
.
<EOS>
You
will
enjoy
allthat
your
young
and
ardent
imagination
can
hope
for
;
but
there
are
somefew
things
yet
to
be
done
ere
<EOS>
I
can
place
you
in
such
a
position
<EOS>
aswould
make
you
the
envy
of
all
.
<EOS>
”These
<EOS>
few
things
,
in
Jacob
Gray
’s
mind
,
consisted
in
efficientpreparations
for
his
own
departure
from
England
;
the
secreting
of
hisconfession
,
and
the
extortion
of
a
yet
further
sum
of
money
from
thefears
of
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“You
do
not
hear
me
,
Ada
,
”
as
she
made
no
reply
.
<EOS>
The
young
girl
shuddered
,
and
shrank
from
him
as
far
as
he
would
permit
.
<EOS>
“You
shrink
from
me
now
,
”
said
Gray
,
“
and
yet
I
am
the
only
person
whocan
and
will
place
you
in
a
position
to
enjoy
every
pleasure
—
to
gratifyevery
taste
<EOS>
.
<EOS>
Ada
,
you
will
be
much
beholden
now
to
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
”Still
Ada
would
not
speak
,
and
they
were
rapidly
nearing
some
stairs
,
at
which
plied
wherries
between
Battersea
and
Westminster
.
<EOS>
Gray
nowlooked
cautiously
around
him
,
and
being
quite
satisfied
that
no
one
waswithin
heating
,
he
stooped
his
mouth
close
to
Ada
’s
ear
,
and
said
,
in
avoice
of
suppressed
yet
violent
passion,—“Girl
,
I
am
a
desperate
man
.
<EOS>
Do
not
tempt
me
beyond
what
I
can
resistto
do
a
deed
which
I
fain
would
not
do
.
<EOS>
Hear
me
,
Ada
—
I
swear
to
haveyour
life
if
you
play
me
false
.
<EOS>
Be
obedient
to
what
I
shall
command
,
and
all
will
be
well
;
but
have
a
care
—
have
a
care
,
for
I
am
desperate
,
and
you
know
what
I
can
do
.
”Jacob
<EOS>
Gray
then
walked
on
in
silence
until
he
reached
the
stalls
,
atwhich
there
was
no
one
but
a
boy
,
who
immediately
cried
to
him
,
“
Boat
,
your
honour
—
going
across
,
sir?”“Yes
,
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
The
boy
ran
into
the
water
to
steady
the
beat
while
Gray
handed
in
Ada
,
who
submitted
passively
.
<EOS>
Then
he
stepped
on
board
himself
,
and
the
boy
,
clambering
in
after
him
,
pushed
the
boat
out
into
the
stream
.
<EOS>
“Where
to
,
your
honour
?
”
said
the
boy
,
as
he
settled
the
sculls
in
therollocks
,
and
gave
,
a
sweep
that
turned
the
boat
’s
head
from
the
shore
.
<EOS>
“To
<EOS>
the
stairs
at
Westminster
-
bridge
,
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
The
boy
nodded
,
and
the
boat
,
under
his
good
management
,
was
soongliding
up
the
stream
in
the
wished
-
for
direction
.
<EOS>
The
sun
was
now
rapidly
sinking
,
and
tall
dark
shadows
lay
upon
thesurface
of
the
Thames
,
making
the
waters
look
as
if
they
were
composedof
different
kinds
of
fluids
of
varying
colours
and
densities
.
<EOS>
Then
thelast
edge
of
the
sun
’s
disc
,
which
had
been
reposing
on
the
horizon
fora
moment
,
suddenly
disappeared
,
and
a
cold
wind
on
the
instant
sweptacross
the
face
of
the
river
,
curling
it
up
into
small
wrinkles
,
andgiving
a
gentle
,
undulating
motion
to
the
boat
.
<EOS>
Not
a
word
was
spoken
,
and
the
small
wherry
might
have
been
occupied
bythe
dead
,
for
all
the
signs
of
life
or
animation
given
by
Gray
or
Ada
.
<EOS>
That
Gray
’s
thoughts
partook
of
the
apprehensive
might
have
beenguessed
by
the
nervous
manner
in
which
he
clutched
the
side
of
theboat
,
and
the
distracted
movement
of
the
fingers
of
his
other
hand
<EOS>
withwhich
<EOS>
he
held
the
collar
of
his
cloak
across
the
lower
part
of
his
face
.
<EOS>
Ada
was
pale
as
a
marble
statue
;
but
there
was
an
intellectuality
anddetermination
about
her
small
,
compressed
lips
and
commanding
brow
thatwould
have
won
admiration
from
all
,
and
enraptured
a
poet
or
a
painter
.
<EOS>
She
sat
calm
and
still
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
nervousness
,
no
trembling
,
noalarm
;
and
it
was
the
absence
of
all
those
natural
and
femininefeelings
which
cast
a
cold
chill
to
the
heart
of
Jacob
Gray
,
and
filledhim
with
a
terror
of
<EOS>
he
knew
not
what
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
for
more
than
one
instant
of
time
keep
his
eyes
off
Ada’sface
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
something
depicted
there
that
while
he
dreaded
,
heseemed
,
by
some
supernatural
power
,
compelled
to
look
upon
.
<EOS>
Like
onefascinated
by
the
basilisk
eye
of
a
serpent
,
he
could
not
withdraw
hisgaze
;
although
pale
,
firm
,
and
slightly
tinged
with
a
death
-
like
hue
bythe
strange
colours
that
lingered
in
the
sky
from
the
sunset
,
thatyoung
and
lovely
face
brought
to
his
recollection
one
which
the
merethought
of
was
an
agony
,
and
the
name
of
whom
was
engraven
upon
hisheart
in
undying
letters
of
eternal
flame
.
<EOS>
The
fresh
breeze
caught
as
it
passed
the
long
glossy
ringlets
of
Ada’shair
,
and
blew
them
in
wanton
playfulness
across
her
face
,
but
stillshe
moved
not
.
<EOS>
The
night
darkened
,
and
the
shadows
of
the
buildings
andshipping
crossed
her
eyes
,
but
she
stirred
not
.
<EOS>
Her
whole
soul
,
withall
its
varied
perceptions
and
powers
seemed
to
be
engrossed
by
someone
great
idea
that
would
admit
of
no
sort
of
companionship
,
and
forthe
time
reigned
alone
within
the
chambers
of
her
brain
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
now
the
boy
let
his
oars
rest
in
the
water
,
and
the
boat
nolonger
urged
forward
,
moved
but
sluggishly
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
seemed
to
be
fixedon
something
.
<EOS>
Now
he
lifted
one
hand
and
shaded
them
,
while
he
lookedearnestly
in
the
direction
from
whence
he
had
been
coming
.
<EOS>
Gray
for
a
moment
did
not
seem
conscious
that
the
boat
was
making
noprogress
,
but
in
fact
slowly
turning
broadside
to
the
stream
,
and
Ada
,
if
she
did
notice
it
,
preserved
her
silence
and
calmness
,
for
sheneither
moved
nor
spoke
.
<EOS>
“Master
,
”
cried
the
boy
,
suddenly
,
and
Gray
started
as
if
he
had
beensuddenly
aroused
by
a
trumpet
at
his
ear
.
<EOS>
“What
—
<EOS>
a
<EOS>
—
what
?
”
<EOS>
he
cried
.
<EOS>
“
<EOS>
Who
spoke?”“I
spoke
,
sir
,
”
said
the
boy
.
<EOS>
“
There
’s
a
famous
fire
out
Battersea
way
.
<EOS>
”“A
fire
?
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“Yes
,
”
said
the
boy
,
and
he
pointed
with
his
finger
in
the
directionfrom
whence
they
came
.
<EOS>
“
It
’s
a
large
fire
;
now
it
does
burn
,
to
besure
.
<EOS>
Look
,
sir
,
there!”Gray
turned
half
round
upon
his
seat
in
the
boat
,
and
he
saw
that
theheavens
were
illuminated
with
a
dull
,
red
glare
in
the
direction
towhich
the
boy
had
pointed
,
and
in
that
one
particular
spot
there
was
aconcentrated
body
of
light
from
whence
shot
up
in
the
sky
myriads
<EOS>
ofbright
sparks
,
and
now
and
then
a
long
tongue
of
flame
which
lit
up
thehouse
,
the
shipping
,
and
the
river
,
with
a
bright
and
transitory
glow
.
<EOS>
“It
is
—
the
house
,
”
muttered
Gray
to
himself
;
“
my
work
prospers
.
<EOS>
SirFrederick
Hartleton
,
I
have
but
one
more
wish

and
that
is

that
yourflesh

broiling

”“It

remarked
the
boy
.
<EOS>
“
A

<EOS>
”“Yes
<EOS>
,
”
said
Gray
,
“
a
famous
fire
;
can
you
tell
where
it
is?”“I
think
,
”
said
the
boy
,
“
it
lies
somewhere
over
the
marshes
.
”“Indeed
.
<EOS>
”“Yes
<EOS>
;
and
I
should
say
it
was
Forest
’s
old
haunted
house
,
only
nobodylives
there
but
the
ghosts
.
”“Forest
<EOS>
’s
house

”
repeated
Gray
,
in
an
assumed
careless
tone
.
<EOS>
“
Indeed
Ishould
not
wonder
if
you
were
right
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
hope
it
is

”
said
the
boy
.
<EOS>
“
It
was
an
old
miserable
-
looking
place
.
<EOS>
You’ve
heard
about
it
,
sir?”“A
little
—
a
little
,
”
replied
Gray
.
<EOS>
“There
was
a
murder
there
once
,
”
said
the
boy

<EOS>
“Yes,—yes

I
—
know

said
Gray

<EOS>
“Forest
,
you
see

sir

lived
in

<EOS>
He
built
it
,
you
see

sir

and
he
was
n’t
content
with
what
he
had
,
so
he
murdered
a
poor
fellow

who
they
say
had
a
thousand
pounds
belonging
to
somebody
who
employedhim
to
collect
rents

<EOS>
”“Yes

said
Gray
,
licking
his
lips

<EOS>
“Well

Forest
shot
him

”“Shot

him

<EOS>
Oh

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
”“He
<EOS>
was
hung

”
added
the
boy
,
“
and
well
he
deserved
it

too

<EOS>
Mygrandfather
saw
him

Well

”The
fire
seemed
now
at

the
flames
rose
to
a
tremendousheight

,
and
the
roaring
and
crackling
of
the
timbers
couldbe
distinctly
heard
,
even
at
that
distance
from
the
spot
of
theconflagration
.
<EOS>
Now
<EOS>
and
then
a
loud
sound
,
resembling
the
discharge
of
artillery
at
adistance
,
would
come
booming
through
the
air
,
indicative
of
the
fall
<EOS>
ofsome
heavy
part
of
the
ancient
building
,
and
<EOS>
then
the
flame
would
besmothered
for
a
moment
,
and
dense
volumes
of
smoke
terrifically
redfrom
the
glare
beneath
,
would
roll
over
the
sky
,
to
be
succeeded
againby
myriads
of
sparks
,
which
would
,
in
their
turns
,
give
place
to
thelong
tongues
of
flame
which
shot
up
from
the
fallen
mass
,
as
it
becamemore
thoroughly
ignited
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
gazed
intently
on
the
scene
for
a
few
minutes
,
then
turningto
the
boy
<EOS>
,
he
cried,—“We
are
in
haste
.
<EOS>
”The
lad
resumed
his
oars
,
and
struck
them
lazily
into
the
glowingstream
,
that
looked
like
liquid
fire
from
the
bright
reflection
of
thesky
,
and
once
more
the
boat
was
making
way
towards
Westminster
.
<EOS>
Several
times
Gray
glanced
in
the
face
of
Ada
,
to
note
what
effect
theburning
of
the
old
house
had
upon
her
imagination
,
but
not
a
musclemoved
—
<EOS>
all
was
as
still
and
calm
as
before
,
and
save
that
the
reflectionfrom
the
reddened
sky
now
cast
a
glow
of
more
than
earthly
beauty
overher
otherwise
pale
face
,
to
look
at
her
,
she
might
have
been
supposedsome
thing
of
Heaven
,
summoned
by
the
small
casualties
and
pettycommotions
of
this
world
,
which
she
had
but
visited
for
a
brief
space
,
for
some
specific
purpose
.
<EOS>
The
boat
glided
on
,
and
so
intent
was
the
boy
upon
the
fire
,
that
hehad
several
narrow
escapes
of
running
foul
of
barges
and
otherwherries
,
some
of
the
latter
of
which
were
pulling
down
the
stream
onpurpose
to
look
at
the
fire
,
which
was
causing
a
great
deal
of
commentand
commotion
among
the
gossips
of
ancient
Westminster
.
<EOS>
Many
were
the
oaths
levelled
on
the
head
of
the
boy
,
by
parties
whowere
obliged
to
ship
their
oars
suddenly
to
avoid
a
collision
with
hisboat
,
and
it
was
not
until
this
happened
thrice
,
that
he
began
to
be
alittle
more
careful
,
and
look
warily
about
him
.
<EOS>
The
stairs
to
which
Gray
directed
the
boy
were
through
the
bridge
,
andthe
boat
now
reached
the
ancient
structure
,
which
looked
beautiful
andbrilliant
from
the
reflection
of
the
fire
upon
its
many
rough
stonesand
jagged
points
of
architecture
.
<EOS>
A
wherry
,
in
which
sat
one
person
besides
the
rower
,
now
came
rapidlyfrom
under
the
same
arch
of
the
bridge
,
through
which
the
boatcontaining
Ada
and
Gray
was
about
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
“Hilloa
!
”
cried
the
man
,
who
was
sitting
in
the
boat
.
<EOS>
“
Hilloa
there!”“Well
,
what
now
?
”
said
the
boy
.
<EOS>
“None
of
your
impertinence
,
youngster
,
”
cried
the
man
,
showing
aconstable
’s
staff
,
which
Ada
knew
no
more
the
meaning
of
than
if
he
hadunfurled
the
banner
of
Mahomet
.
<EOS>
“Well
<EOS>
,
sir
,
”
said
the
boy
,
“
I
only
want
to
land
my
passengers
.
<EOS>
”“You
may
land
your
passengers
,
and
be
d
—
d
,
”
replied
the
man
inauthority
.
<EOS>
“Thank
<EOS>
you
kindly
sir
,
”
replied
the
boy
,
promptly
.
<EOS>
The
rower
in
the
other
boat
laughed
at
this
,
and
the
constable
cried,—“Come
,
come
,
none
of
this
.
<EOS>
How
far
have
you
pulled
up
the
river
,
boy?”“From
Battersea
.
”“Oh
,
hem
!
<EOS>
From
Battersea?”“I
told
you
so
.
<EOS>
”“Come
,
come
,
young
fellow
—
no
insolence
.
<EOS>
Where
’s
the
fire?”“I
ca
n’t
say
exactly
.
”“Where
<EOS>
do
you
think
it
is
?
<EOS>
You
say
you
have
pulled
up
from
Battersea
,
and
the
fire
is
at
Battersea
,
we
know
.
<EOS>
”“I
think
it
’s
at
old
Forest
’s
haunted
house
,
”
said
the
boy
.
<EOS>
“D
<EOS>
—
d
if
I
did
n’t
think
so
<EOS>
,
”
cried
the
officer
,
who
was
no
other
thanour
old
friend
Stephy
;
“
I
must
go
and
see
,
though
,
notwithstanding
.
<EOS>
Pull
away
,
my
man
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
wherries
shot
past
each
other
,
and
in
a
few
moments
more
,
Ada
andGray
stood
on
the
top
of
the
flight
of
stone
steps
conducting
from
theriver
to

CHAPTER
LI.The
Alcove
on
the
Bridge.—Gray
’s
Speech
to
Ada.—The
Flight.—TheHunt.—The
<EOS>
Last
Refuge
.
<EOS>
London
was
not
so
thronged
with
passengers
at
the
period
of
our
tale
asit
<EOS>
is
now
,
and
Gray
stood
with
Ada
several
moments
at
the
corner
ofWestminster
-
bridge
,
without
more
than
three
persons
passing
,
and
thoseat
intervals
apart
from
each
other
.
<EOS>
Gray
appeared
to
be
in
deep
thought
during
this
time
,
and
then
takingAda
by
the
arm
,
he
said
in
a
trembling
voice,—“This
way
,
this
way
,
”
and
led
her
to
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
Ada
made
no
resistance
,
but
suffered
herself
to
be
conducted
into
oneof
the
little
alcoves
which
now
exist
.
<EOS>
Then
,
after
a
pause
,
Jacob
Grayspoke
to
her
in
a
low
,
earnest
tone
,
to
the
following
purport:—“Ada
,
the
time
is
now
fast
approaching
when
you
will
be
free
—
free
inaction
as
in
thought
,
and
with
the
means
of
giving
to
every
thought
,
however
wayward
or
expensive
,
the
immediate
aspect
of
reality
.
<EOS>
You
willbe
guided
implicitly
by
me
,
Ada
,
for
the
space
of
about
one
month
,
andno
longer
—
then
all
that
I
promise
will
be
fulfilled
,
and
you
will
behappy
.
<EOS>
You
may
then
forget
Jacob
Gray
,
for
you
will
see
him
no
more
.
<EOS>
Inanother
country
I
will
spend
the
remainder
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
What
I
am
aboutto
do
now
is
,
to
seek
in
the
very
heart
of
this
populous
city
,
atemporary
abode
for
you
and
myself
.
<EOS>
I
am
tired
of
solitudes
and
lonelyplaces
.
<EOS>
Ada
,
you
must
for
that
brief
month
assume
in
all
appearance
thecharacter
of
my
daughter
.
<EOS>
”Ada
<EOS>
shuddered
,
and
shrank
back
as
far
as
she
possibly
could
into
thealcove
,
for
Gray
,
in
the
earnestness
of
his
discourse
,
had
brought
hisface
in
very
close
proximity
to
hers
.
<EOS>
“For
<EOS>
your
own
sake
,
as
well
as
for
mine
,
”
he
continued
,
“
you
must
passas
a
child
of
mine
.
<EOS>
When
I
am
gone
,
you
may
repudiate
the
relationshipas
quickly
as
you
may
think
proper
.
”Jacob
<EOS>
Gray
then
paused
as
if
awaiting
the
answer
of
Ada
,
but
to
hisgreat
surprise
and
aggravation
,
she
preserved
the
same
unbroken
silencewhich
she
had
dictated
to
herself
since
the
murder
at
the
lone
house
.
<EOS>
“You
will
not
answer
me
,
”
said
Gray
,
with
bitterness
.
<EOS>
“
Well
,
be
it
so
.
<EOS>
Let
no
words
pass
between
us
.
<EOS>
I
can
construe
your
silence
<EOS>
—
you
feel
thatyou
must
obey
me
,
and
yet
you
can
not
bring
your
nature
to
give
me
oneword
of
acquiescence
.
’
<EOS>
Tis
as
well
,
Ada—’tis
as
well
.
<EOS>
Our
conversationshave
never
been
so
satisfactory
that
I
should
wish
to
urge
theircontinuance
.
<EOS>
You
may
preserve
your
silence
,
but
you
must
obey
me
.
<EOS>
Before
this
time
I
have
been
placed
in
desperate
straits
,
and
havereflected
upon
desperate
remedies
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Ada
,
remember
that
if
youbetray
me
,
or
even
leave
me
,
until
the
time
I
shall
please
to
appoint
,
you
shall
die
.
<EOS>
Remember
,
young
,
beautiful
as
you
are
,
you
shall
die
.
”Again
<EOS>
Gray
paused
with
the
hope
that
Ada
would
speak
,
for
although
heaffected
to
despise
it
,
the
silence
of
the
young
girl
was
an
annoyanceto
<EOS>
him
of
the
first
magnitude
.
<EOS>
His
hope
,
however
,
was
futile
.
<EOS>
She
spoke
not
.
<EOS>
“Come
,
follow
me
,
”
cried
Gray
,
suddenly
.
<EOS>
“
Here
,
place
your
arm
in
mine
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
attempted
to
draw
her
arm
within
his
as
he
spoke
,
but
Ada
drew
backso
firmly
and
resolutely
,
that
Gray
saw
she
would
not
walk
with
him
insuch
apparent
amity
.
<EOS>
“As
<EOS>
you
please
,
”
he
said
,
“
so
that
you
follow
me
.
<EOS>
Come
on
—
come
on
.
<EOS>
”Ada
stepped
from
the
alcove
onto
the
bridge
,
and
then
Gray
paused
amoment
to
see
if
he
was
observed
,
and
being
satisfied
that
he
was
not
,
he
drew
aside
the
collar
of
his
cloak
and
showed
Ada
the
bright
barrelof
a
pistol
,
to
which
he
pointed
,
saying,—“Remember
—
death
,
sudden
,
painful
,
and
violent
on
the
one
hand
,
and
onthe
other
,
after
a
short
month
,
unbounded
wealth
,
enjoyment
,
anddelight
.
<EOS>
Come
on
—
come
on
.
<EOS>
”Side
<EOS>
by
side
,
the
ill
-
assorted
pair
walked
in
the
direction
ofParliament
-
street
,
it
being
Gray
<EOS>
’s
intention
to
pass
throughWestminster
,
and
proceed
towards
the
densely
populated
district
northof
the
Strand
,
there
to
seek
for
a
temporary
lodging
<EOS>
in
which
he
andAda
as
his
daughter
,
could
remain
until
he
had
perfected
hisarrangements
for
his
own
escape
,
and
the
utter
destruction
of
Learmontand
Britton
.
<EOS>
Gray
had
calculated
his
chances
and
position
well
.
<EOS>
He
stood
as
free
asever
from
any
attempt
against
his
life
by
Learmont
or
the
savage
smith
.
<EOS>
Ada
,
even
if
she
should
suddenly
leave
him
,
scarcely
knew
enough
to
bethoroughly
dangerous
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
had
but
an
indistinctknowledge
of
his
person
,
and
even
should
he
meet
him
in
the
publicstreets
,
he
could
hardly
hit
upon
him
as
being
the
man
who
had
merelyflashed
across
his
eyes
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
it
was
possible
to
makesufficient
alterations
in
his
personal
appearance
to
deceive
those
whowere
not
very
well
acquainted
with
his
general
aspect
and
appearance
.
<EOS>
Then
he
need
not
go
from
home
above
four
times
,
perhaps
,
in
that
wholemonth
,
even
provided
he
remained
so
long
in
London
,
and
on
thoseoccasions
it
would
only
be
to
creep
cautiously
from
his
own
place
ofabode
to
Learmont
’s
house
and
back
again
,
so
that
the
risk
would
be
butsmall
of
meeting
the
magistrate
or
Albert
Seyton
,
who
were
the
only
twopersons
at
all
interested
in
his
capture
.
<EOS>
His
threats
to
Ada
that
he
would
take
her
life
upon
any
attempt
of
hersto
escape
,
were
perfectly
insincere
.
<EOS>
To
Ada
and
her
existence
he
clungas
to
his
only
hope
of
mercy
,
if
by
some
untoward
circumstance
heshould
be
taken
,
as
well
as
for
his
only
means
of
being
thoroughly
andentirely
revenged
upon
Learmont
.
<EOS>
Upon
the
whole
,
then
,
Jacob
Gray
,
as
he
walked
down
Parliament
-
street
,
in
the
dim
,
uncertain
light
from
the
oil
lamps
of
the
period
,
and
sawthat
Ada
followed
him
slowly
,
rather
congratulated
himself
upon
hisextreme
cunning
and
the
good
position
for
working
out
all
his
darlingprojects
,
both
of
avarice
and
revenge
,
in
which
he
was
placed
.
<EOS>
“There
is
an
old
proverb
,
”
he
muttered
,
“
which
says
,
‘
the
nearer
tochurch
,
the
further
from
Heaven
,
’
and
I
have
read
somewhere
a
fable
ofa
hunted
hare
finding
a
secure
,
because
an
unsuspected
,
place
of
refugein
a
dog
-
kennel
.
<EOS>
Upon
that
principal
will
I
secrete
myself
for
oneshort
month
in
some
place
densely
inhabited
;
where
two
persons
make
butan
insignificant
item
in
the
great
mass
that
surrounds
them
,
will
Iseek
security
,
and
then
my
revenge
—
my
deep
revenge!”But
few
passengers
were
in
Parliament
-
street
;
the
quantity
of
persons
,
however
,
sensibly
increased
as
they
approached
Whitehall
,
and
fromCharing
-
cross
the
lights
were
just
glancing
when
Ada
suddenly
paused
,
and
Gray
,
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
,
got
two
or
three
paces
inadvance
of
her
.
<EOS>
There
were
two
persons
conversing
,
about
whereScotland
-
yard
stands
,
and
laughing
carelessly
,
while
several
morepeople
were
rapidly
approaching
from
Charing
-
cross
.
<EOS>
Gray
was
sensible
in
a
moment
that
Ada
had
stopped
,
and
he
hurriedimmediately
to
see
what
were
her
intentions
.
<EOS>
As
he
did
so
,
Ada
broke
the
long
silence
she
had
maintained
by
suddenlyexclaiming
,
in
a
voice
that
arrested
every
passenger
,
and
made
theblood
retreat
with
a
frightful
gush
to
the
heart
of
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
“Help
!
<EOS>
Help
!
<EOS>
Seize
him
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
murderer
—
a
murderer!—Help
!
<EOS>
Help
!
<EOS>
Seizethe
<EOS>
murderer!”For
<EOS>
one
moment
all
sense
of
perception
seemed
to
have
left
Gray
,
sothoroughly
unexpected
<EOS>
was
such
an
act
on
the
part
of
Ada
,
and
it
waswell
for
him
that
those
who
were
around
for
about
the
same
space
oftime
remained
in
a
similar
undecided
and
bewildered
state
,
as
people
doalways
on
any
very
sudden
occasion
for
instant
action
.
<EOS>
Ada
stood
pointing
with
one
trembling
finger
at
Gray
,
while
her
paleface
and
long
black
hair
,
combined
with
her
rare
beauty
,
made
her
looklike
one
inspired
.
<EOS>
“The
murderer
!
”
<EOS>
she
again
cried
,
and
her
voice
seemed
to
break
thespell
which
kept
both
Gray
and
the
chance
passengers
paralysed
.
<EOS>
With
a
cry
of
terror
,
Jacob
Gray
turned
and
fled
towards
Charing
-
cross
.
<EOS>
Ada
’s
feelings
had
been
wrought
up
to
too
high
a
pitch
of
excitement
.
<EOS>
She
had
felt
it
to
be
her
duty
to
denounce
the
murderer
,
and
while
thatduty
remained
to
be
done
,
the
consciousness
that
upon
her
it
devolved
,
had
nerved
her
to
the
task
,
and
supported
her
hitherto
—
now
,
however
,
the
words
were
spoken
.
<EOS>
At
what
she
supposed
the
risk
of
her
life
,
shehad
announced
the
crime
of
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
The
revulsion
of
feeling
was
toomuch
,
and
a
bystander
,
who
saw
her
stagger
,
was
just
in
time
to
catchher
as
she
fainted
,
and
would
otherwise
have
fallen
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
The
two
persons
who
had
been
talking
and
laughing
together
at
themoment
of
Ada
’s
first
exclamation
,
did
not
seem
disposed
to
let
theaccused
man
get
off
so
easily
as
he
appeared
upon
the
point
of
doing
.
<EOS>
They
raised
the
cry
so
awful
in
the
ear
of
a
fugitive
through
thestreets
of
London
,
“
Stop
him
!
<EOS>
Stop
him
!
”
<EOS>
And
they
both
started
afterJacob
Gray
at
full
speed
.
<EOS>
Had
Gray
,
when
he
turned
the
corner
of
Northumberland
-
house
,
thenwalked
quietly
,
like
an
ordinary
passenger
,
the
chances
were
that
hewould
have
escaped
;
but
,
in
his
terror
,
he
flew
rather
than
ran
up
theStrand
,
at
once
pointing
himself
out
to
all
as
the
one
pursued
,
andtempting
every
person
who
had
time
or
inclination
to
join
the
excitingchase
.
<EOS>
The
words
,
“
Stop
him
!
”
<EOS>
sounded
in
his
ears
,
and
he
bounded
forward
<EOS>
ashe
heard
them
,
with
another
cry
and
a
speed
that
,
while
it
made
it
veryhazardous
for
every
one
to
oppose
him
,
yet
increased
the
ardour
of
thepursuit
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
a
few
seconds
,
fifty
persons
had
joined
the
chase
,
andyells
and
shouts
came
upon
Gray
’s
affrighted
ears
.
<EOS>
With
compressed
lips
and
a
face
as
livid
as
that
of
a
corpse
,
he
rushedon
without
the
smallest
idea
of
where
he
was
going
.
<EOS>
“For
<EOS>
my
life
—
for
my
life
,
”
he
gasped
,
and
each
cry
behind
him
affectedhim
like
a
shock
of
electricity
,
and
caused
him
to
give
another
boundforward
in
all
the
wildness
of
despair
.
<EOS>
Of
the
crowd
now
that
followed
Gray
,
not
one
knew
who
he
was
,
of
whathe
was
accused
,
or
why
he
was
thus
hunted
,
like
a
wild
annual
,
throughthe
streets
.
<EOS>
One
joined
in
the
cry
because
he
saw
others
engaged
in
it
.
<EOS>
The
two
young
men
who
had
first
raised
the
chase
were
a
long
way
off
,
for
no
one
could
keep
up
with
the
frantic
speed
of
the
nearly
maddenedGray
.
<EOS>
Those
who
followed
him
the
closest
were
those
who
had
joined
thehunt
en
route
;
although
,
to
the
fugitive
’s
excited
imagination
,
heseemed
to
be
on
the
point
of
being
overtaken
by
harder
runners
thanhimself
.
<EOS>
Shouts
,
cries
,
hootings
,
groans
,
and
every
wild
and
demoniac
noise
ofwhich
<EOS>
the
human
animal
is
capable
,
were
uttered
by
the
mob
,
which
keptmomentarily
increasing
as
each
alley
,
court
,
or
street
,
sent
forth
itstribute
of
numbers
to
the
stream
that
roared
,
whooped
,
hurried
,
andraced
along
the
Strand
.
<EOS>
Some
began
now
to
throw
missiles
of
all
kinds
after
Gray
.
<EOS>
Stones
andmud
showered
upon
him
,
and
he
felt
faint
and
neatly
exhausted
,
as
hesaw
at
some
distance
before
him
a
man
apparently
intent
upon
stoppinghim
.
<EOS>
Little
,
however
,
did
he
who
thought
to
capture
Gray
reflect
upon
theshock
he
would
receive
from
the
speed
of
the
hunted
man
.
<EOS>
As
Grayapproached
him
he
swerved
,
more
involuntarily
than
designedly
,
andcoming
against
the
man
rather
obliquely
<EOS>
,
he
shot
him
into
the
roadwaywith
an
impetus
that
sent
him
rolling
over
and
over
in
the
mud
,
as
ifhe
had
been
discharged
from
a
cannon
.
<EOS>
To
Gray
the
shock
was
severe
,
butit
did
not
take
him
off
his
feet
,
and
the
circumstance
caused
somelittle
diversion
in
his
favour
than
otherwise
;
for
the
mob
firsttrampled
upon
the
prostrate
man
,
and
then
some
fell
over
him
.
<EOS>
After
this
,
none
were
so
bold
as
to
stand
in
the
way
of
a
man
who
wasrushing
along
with
so
terrible
a
speed
;
and
Jacob
Gray
,
reeling
,
panting
,
his
lips
running
with
blood
,
as
he
had
bitten
them
in
hisagony
,
arrived
at
Somerset
-
house
.
<EOS>
Just
beyond
the
stone
front
was
a
small
court
,
and
towards
thistemporary
place
of
refuge
from
the
high
street
Gray
tottered
,
spinninground
and
round
,
like
a
drunken
man
.
<EOS>
A
light
,
agile
man
,
who
had
joined
the
chase
by
the
Adelphi
,
and
whohad
kept
very
close
upon
Gray
,
now
,
with
a
shout
of
triumph
,
made
arush
forward
,
and
grappled
with
him
at
the
mouth
of
the
little
court
.
<EOS>
The
touch
seemed
like
magic
to
revive
all
the
fainting
energies
ofJacob
Gray
,
and
he
turned
and
grappled
his
enemy
by
the
throat
withfearful
vehemence
.
<EOS>
The
court
descended
from
the
street
by
a
flight
of
stone
steps
,
and
inthe
next
instant
with
a
shriek
from
the
man
,
and
a
wild
cry
from
Gray
,
the
pursuer
and
pursued
rolled
down
the
stone
descent
,
struggling
witheach
other
for
life
or
death
.

Bruised

<EOS>
Gray
and
the
adventurous
stranger
who
had
essayedto
capture
him
,
arrived
at
the
bottom
of
the
flight
of
stone
steps
,
andfor
one
or
two
seconds
<EOS>
it
was
doubtful
if
either
of
them
were
in
acondition
to
make
any
further
effort
either
offensive
or
defensive
.
<EOS>
The
fear
of
capture
and
death
,
however
,
was
sufficiently
strong
in
themind
of
Jacob
Gray
to
overcome
for
the
moment
the
sense
of
pain
arisingfrom
personal
injury
;
and
with
an
energy
,
lent
to
him
by
despair
alone
,
he
rose
on
his
knees
and
felt
about
for
his
antagonist
.
<EOS>
His
handtouched
the
man
’s
face
,
and
now
he
began
to
move
.
<EOS>
With
somethingbetween
a
shriek
and
a
shout
,
Gary
laid
hold
of
his
head
by
the
hair
oneach
side
.
<EOS>
He
lifted
it
as
far
as
he
could
from
the
stones
and
thenbrought
it
down
again
with
a
sinking
awful
crash
.
<EOS>
One
deep
hollow
groanonly
came
from
the
man
,
and
again
Gray
lifted
the
head
,
bringing
itdown
as
before
with
frightful
violence
.
<EOS>
The
skull
cracked
and
smashedagainst
the
hard
stones
.
<EOS>
The
man
was
dead
,
but
once
more
was
thebleeding
and
crashed
head
brought
into
violent
contact
with
the
stones
,
and
that
time
the
sound
it
produced
was
soft
,
and
Jacob
Gray
felt
thathe
held
but
loose
pieces
of
bone
,
and
his
hands
were
slimy
and
slipperywith
the
blood
that
spouted
on
to
them
.
<EOS>
Faltering
,
dizzy
,
and
faint
<EOS>
,
he
then
rose
to
his
feet
,
and
from
theopen
throughfare
there
came
to
his
ears
shouts
,
cries
,
and
groans
.
<EOS>
Thenhe
cast
his
eyes
to
the
dim
opening
of
the
court
,
and
he
heard
severalvoices
cry,—“He
is
hiding
down
here
.
<EOS>
Let
’s
hunt
him
out
.
<EOS>
Lights
—
lights!”In
<EOS>
a
state
of
agony
beyond
description
<EOS>
Gray
now
turned
to
seek
shelterfurther
down
the
dark
court
,
and
in
doing
<EOS>
so
he
trod
upon
the
dead
bodyof
the
man
he
had
just
hurried
from
existence
.
<EOS>
Recoiling
then
,
as
if
a
serpent
had
been
in
his
path
,
he
crept
along
bythe
wall
until
he
thought
he
must
have
passed
the
awful
and
revoltingobject
which
now
in
death
he
dreaded
quite
as
much
as
he
did
in
life
.
<EOS>
He
then
plunged
wildly
forward
,
heedless
where
his
steps
might
lead
,
sothat
it
was
away
from
his
pursuers
.
<EOS>
A
few
paces
now
in
advance
of
himhe
descried
a
dim
faint
ray
of
light
,
and
hastening
onwards
he
foundhimself
at
the
entrance
of
a
court
running
parallel
with
the
Strand
,
and
consisting
of
mean
,
dirty
,
squalid
-
looking
houses
inhabited
by
thevery
dregs
of
the
poorer
classes
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
half
-
broken
dirty
parlour
windows
in
this
haunt
of
povertywere
converted
into
shops
by
being
set
open
,
and
a
board
placed
acrossin
<EOS>
the
inside
displaying
disgusting
messes
in
the
shape
of
eatables
,
mingled
with
wood
,
old
bones
,
rags
,
&
c
.
<EOS>
Gray
hesitated
a
moment
and
cast
his
eyes
behind
him
.
<EOS>
A
loud
yell
methis
affrighted
ears
,
and
lights
began
to
flash
in
the
direction
he
hadleft
behind
him
.
<EOS>
With
a
groan
of
despair
,
he
rushed
into
the
dark
openpassage
of
one
of
the
houses
.
<EOS>
Breathing
hard
from
his
exertions
and
the
fright
he
was
in
,
Gray
gropedhis
way
along
by
the
damp
clammy
walls
of
the
passage
until
he
came
tosome
stairs
—
he
hesitated
not
a
moment
,
but
slowly
and
cautiouslyascended
them
.
<EOS>
As
he
crept
stair
after
stair
up
the
dark
flight
of
steps
the
sound
ofpursuit
seemed
to
come
nearer
and
nearer
,
and
he
could
hear
the
hum
ofmany
voices
,
although
he
could
not
distinguish
exactly
what
was
said
.
<EOS>
Only
one
word
came
perpetually
as
clearly
and
distinctly
to
his
ears
asif
it
had
been
spoken
at
his
side
,
and
that
word
was
murder!“They
—
they
have
found
the
body
,
”
he
gasped
.
<EOS>
“
Yes
,
they
have
found
thebody
now
.
<EOS>
My
life
hangs
on
a
thread!”The
cold
perspiration
of
fear
rolled
down
his
face
,
and
notwithstandinghis
great
exertions
which
would
ordinarily
have
produced
an
intolerablesense
of
heat
,
he
was
as
cold
and
chilled
as
if
he
had
suddenlyawakened
from
sleep
in
the
open
air
.
<EOS>
His
teeth
chattered
in
his
head
,
and
his
knees
smote
each
other
.
<EOS>
He
was
fain
to
clutch
with
both
handsthe
crazy
banisters
of
the
staircase
for
support
,
or
he
must
inevitablyhave
fallen
.
<EOS>
“This
is
dreadful
,
”
he
whispered
to
himself
,
“
to
die
here
.
<EOS>
They
havehunted
me
to
death
—
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
—
I
feel
as
if
a
hand
of
ice
was
on
my
heart
.
<EOS>
Thismust
be
death
.
<EOS>
”Slowly
the
cold
sensation
wore
off
,
and
like
the
flame
of
a
taper
,
which
suddenly
renews
its
origin
most
unexpectedly
,
when
apparentlyupon
the
point
of
dissolution
,
Gray
gradually
revived
again
,
and
hisvital
energies
came
back
to
him
.
<EOS>
With
a
deep
sigh
he
spoke,—“’Tis
<EOS>
past—’tis
past
.
<EOS>
They
have
not
killed
me
as
yet
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
afterall
,
but
a
passing
pang
.
<EOS>
They
have
not
killed
me
yet
.
<EOS>
”Again
<EOS>
the
cry
of
murder
echoed
in
the
court
,
and
,
with
a
start
,
JacobGray
set
his
teeth
hard
,
and
continued
to
ascend
the
dark
staircase
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
now
,
he
paused
,
for
a
sound
from
above
met
his
ears
—
<EOS>
it
wassome
one
singing
.
<EOS>
How
strangely
the
tones
jarred
upon
the
excitedsenses
of
Jacob
Gray
:
the
sound
was
low
and
plaintive
,
and
to
him
itseemed
a
mockery
of
his
awful
situation
.
<EOS>
He
now
by
two
more
steps
gained
the
landing
,
and
he
was
sure
that
thesinging
proceeded
from
some
room
on
that
floor
.
<EOS>
The
voice
was
afemale
’s
,
and
by
the
softness
and
exquisite
cadences
of
it
evidentlyproceeded
from
some
person
not
far
advanced
in
life
.
<EOS>
Gray
held
by
the
banisters
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
,
and
for
someminutes
he
seemed
spell
-
bound
,
and
to
forget
the
precarious
situationin
which
he
stood
as
those
low
,
soft
strains
came
upon
his
ear
.
<EOS>
The
female
was
evidently
singing
to
a
child
,
for
occasionally
she
wouldpause
to
express
some
words
of
endearment
to
the
little
one
,
and
thenresume
her
song
.
<EOS>
The
few
short
lines
of
which
the
song
was
composed
came
fully
to
Gray
,
and
there
was
a
something
about
their
very
simplicity
and
innocencethat
rooted
him
to
the
spot
,
although
they
brought
agony
to
his
heart
:
The
Mother
’s
Choice
.
<EOS>
“My
<EOS>
babe
,
if
I
had
offers
three
,
From
gentle
heavenly
powers
,
To
bless
thee
,
who
,
with
aching
heart
,
I’ve
watched
so
many
hours
,
<EOS>
I’d
choose
that
gift
should
make
thee
greatIn
true
nobility
—
That
greatness
of
the
soul
which
leavesThe
heart
and
conscience
free
.
<EOS>
Gold
should
not
tempt
me
,
gentle
babe
,
It
might
not
bring
thee
rest;Nor
power
<EOS>
would
I
give
to
thee,’Tis
but
an
aching
breast
.
<EOS>
But
I
would
ask
of
Heaven
,
my
babe
,
A
boon
of
joy
to
thee
,
To
make
thee
happy
in
this
life
,
From
sin
and
sorrow
free
.
<EOS>
Nor
gold
nor
silver
should’st
<EOS>
thou
have
,
Nor
power
to
command
,
But
thou
should’st
have
a
guileless
heart
,
An
open
,
unstained
hand
.
<EOS>
So
should
thou
happy
be
,
my
babe
,
A
thing
of
joy
and
light;While
others
struggled
for
despair
,
<EOS>
You’d
wish
but
<EOS>
to
be
right
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
song
abruptly
ceased
,
for
the
loud
tones
of
men
<EOS>
reached
the
ears
ofthe
singer
,
crying,—“Murder!—Hunt
him
—
secure
the
murderer
!
<EOS>
This
way
—
this
way!”Those
sounds
roused
Gray
from
his
temporary
inaction
:
he
startedforward
as
if
he
had
received
some
sudden
and
irresistible
shock
.
<EOS>
More
from
impulse
than
any
direct
design
or
preconcerted
plan
,
JacobGray
made
towards
the
door
of
the
room
in
which
was
the
mother
and
herinfant
child
.
<EOS>
At
the
moment
,
then
,
a
sudden
thought
struck
his
mind
that
possibly
hemight
convert
the
affection
of
the
mother
for
her
infant
into
a
meansof
saving
himself
:
it
was
a
hope
,
at
all
events
,
although
a
weak
andforlorn
one
.
<EOS>
Time
,
however
,
was
precious
,
and
Jacob
Gray
,
with
hispale
,
ghastly
face
,
torn
apparel
,
bleeding
-
hands
,
and
generaldishevelled
look
,
made
his
appearance
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
By
the
remains
of
a
miserable
fire
sat
a
young
female
scarcely
abovethe
age
of
girlhood
,
and
in
a
cot
at
her
feet
slept
a
child
,
the
faceof
which
she
was
regarding
with
that
rapt
attention
and
concentratedlove
which
can
only
be
felt
by
a
mother
.
<EOS>
So
entirely
,
in
fact
,
were
all
the
faculties
of
the
young
mother
woundup
in
the
contemplation
of
her
sleeping
child
,
that
Gray
’s
<EOS>
entranceinto
the
room
failed
to
arouse
her
,
and
he
had
time
to
glance
aroundthe
room
and
be
sure
that
he
and
the
mother
,
with
the
child
,
were
theonly
occupants
of
the
place
before
he
spoke
.
<EOS>
He
then
drew
the
pistol
he
still
retained
from
his
breast
,
and
suddenlycried,—“One
word
,
and
it
shall
cost
you
your
life
!
<EOS>
Be
silent
and
obedient
,
andyou
are
safe
.
<EOS>
”A
<EOS>
cry
escaped
the
lips
of
the
young
female
,
and
she
stoodpanic
-
stricken
by
Gray
’s
strange
appearance
,
as
well
as
his
threateningaspect
and
words
.
<EOS>
“Listen
to
me
,
”
he
said
,
in
a
low
,
hoarse
voice
;

echoed
the
mother
,
in
a
tone
that
sufficientlyanswered
the
question
of
Gray
,
who
added,—“I
am
a
desperate
man

<EOS>
I
do
not
wish

do
you

betray
me

”“No

<EOS>
no

cried
the
mother
,
in
a
voice
of
alarm

<EOS>
“Hush

<EOS>
cried
Gray
,
advancing
;
and
pointing
the
muzzle
of
his
pistoltowards
the
sleeping
form
of
the

<EOS>
“
Such
another
outcry

Iwill
execute
my
threat

<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
young
mother
stood
paralysed
with
terror
,
while
Gray
hastily
added,—“I
am
hunted

I
tell
you

Have
you
no

Speak!”“Concealment

Good

How

”A
<EOS>
loud
shout
at
this
moment
<EOS>
rang
through
the
court
,
and
the
flashingbeams
of
several
torches
blazed
through
the
murky
windows
of

“What

<EOS>
cried
the
female

<EOS>
“My

said
Gray

<EOS>
“
Now

Gray

“

a
face

agonised
terror
the

drew
the

withoutawakening
the
fastly

slumbering

,
towards
the
wall

<EOS>
“Now

“

trembling
with
terror

scarcely

“I

handed

earthen

“Now

with
a

sat
down

<EOS>
The
tramp
of
men
was
now
heard
below

a
voice
cried,“Detain

Gray

He
then
insinuated
himself
between

that

in

he
again

With
a
faltering
voice
the
terrified
female
commenced
the
strain
whichGray
had
overheard
her
singing
to
her
child
before
it
was
placed
in
thefearful
jeopardy
she
now
considered
it
in
.
<EOS>
The
men
’s
footsteps
sounded
on
the
staircase
,
as
in
trembling
accentsshe
softly
repeated
the
words,—“My
babe
,
if
I
had
offers
three
,
From
gentle
heavenly
powers
,
To
bless
thee
,
who
,
with
aching
heart
,
I’ve
watched
so
many
hours—”There
was
then
a
slight
pause
—
a
knock
from
without
—
a
broad
glare
oflight
,
and
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
’s
pursuers
were
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
The
mother
rose
from
her
chair
,
and
cried,—“What
<EOS>
do
you
mean?—What
is
the
meaning
of
all
this?”“We
are
pursuing
a
man
,
who
is
hiding
in
one
of
these
houses

replieda
stern
voice
.
<EOS>
“
I
am
an
officer

<EOS>
There
has
been

<EOS>
”“Murder!”“Yes

<EOS>
A

has
been
savagely
murdered
at

Have

”“I

have
you
heard
any

was
singing

Pray

loud

”“Search
<EOS>
the
room

cried
the
man
.
<EOS>
The
mother
walked
to
the
side
,
of
the
cot
,
and
appeared
to
be
regardingthe
features
of
her
sleeping
babe
,
but
she
was
in
reality
<EOS>
endeavouringto
hide
the
expression
of
terror
which
she
felt
was
upon
her
face
.
<EOS>
The
men
raised
the
torches
they
carried
high
above
their
heads
,
andglanced
round
the
miserable
apartment
.
<EOS>
“Open
that
cupboard
,
”
said
one
.
<EOS>
It
was
opened
and
then
shut
again
.
<EOS>
“Move
<EOS>
that
cot
,
”
cried
he
who
appeared
to
be
in
authority
.
<EOS>
“No
,
”
cried
the
mother
,
suddenly
looking
up
,
“
do
your
duty
indiscovering
the
criminal

but
do
not
in
doing
it

needless
actof
cruelty

<EOS>
”“Cruelty!”“Yes
<EOS>
;
you
see
my
babe
is
sleeping

<EOS>
Why
move
his
cot
and
awaken
him
?
<EOS>
Hehas
been
ill

<EOS>
The
fever
spot
is
still
upon
his
cheek
.
<EOS>
The
quiet
slumberhe
is
now
enjoying
is
the
first
he
has
had
for
many
weary
nights
anddays
.
<EOS>
How
could
a
murderer
hide
with
a
sleeping
child
?
<EOS>
Some
of
youperhaps
have
little
ones
of
your
own
,
if
you
have
,
you
will
think
ofthem

and
not

mine

<EOS>
”“Was
it
<EOS>
you
singing
just
now

“
asked
the
officer
.
<EOS>
“It
was

<EOS>
My

soothes
him

<EOS>
Do

so
loud

”“Leave

said
the
officer

<EOS>
“
My
good

we
do

”“A

said
the
woman
.
<EOS>
“
You

perhaps

saved
the
very
life
of
my

by
not
disturbing

<EOS>
”“What
<EOS>
,
has
it
been
so
bad
as
that
?

<EOS>
remarked
another
.
<EOS>
“Oh

quite

turn
of

remarked
another

<EOS>
“Come

said
the
officer

“

We
are
sorry

If

<EOS>
”“Yes
,
yes
,
”
gasped
the
young
mother
,
scarcely
yet
believing
that
herinfant
was
safe
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
moments
more
the
room
was
clear
of
the
men
,
and
then
the
womancovered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
burst
into
such
a
hystericalpassion
of
weeping
,
that
Gray
was
dreadfully
alarmed
lest
it
should
beheard
,
and
induce
a
return
of
his
pursuers
.
<EOS>
“Peace
,
woman
—
peace
,
”
he
said
,
in
a
hoarse
whisper
,
from
hishiding

place

<EOS>
“
I
am
not

out

<EOS>
cried
the

<EOS>
”“Not

said
Jacob
Gray
,
slowly
and
cautiously
emerging
fromhis
hiding

place
,
“
not

<EOS>
This
place
is
now
the

I
have
a

and
when
he
returns

he
may
notbe
so
weak
as
his
wife

<EOS>
”Gray
started
,
and
replied
in
accents
of
fear,—“When
—
when
do
you
expect
him?”“Even
now
—
he
may
be
here
directly

<EOS>
”“I
must
go.—I
must
go

said
Gray

<EOS>
“
You
are
telling
me
the
truth

<EOS>
Iwill
give
you
gold

you

me
here

”“My
<EOS>
compliance
with
your
commands

said
the
woman
,
“
arose
from

the
love

<EOS>
Heaven
knows
we
arepoor

wretchedly
poor

but
gold
from
your
polluted
hands
would
bringwith
it
a
curse
,
instead
of
a
blessing

<EOS>
”“You
reject
a
large
sum
for
an
hour

safety
for
me?”“I
do

<EOS>
”“But
<EOS>
your

may
better
see
his

this
matter

<EOS>
”“No
<EOS>
—
my

is
poor

he
was
not

so

<EOS>
The
feelings

cling
to

<EOS>
Go

save

”“That

crime

Gray

On
your

<EOS>
”Gray
stood
near
the
door
,
listening
attentively
,
and
presently
he
hearddescending
footsteps
,
which
from
their
number
,
he
supposed
rightly
tobe
the
officers
returning
from
their
unsuccessful
search
in
the
upperrooms
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
drew
his
pistol
from
his
breast
,
and
pointing
to
the
child
,
said
ina
whisper
to
the
weeping
mother,—“One
word
as
they
pass
,
and
I
fire
.
<EOS>
”His
<EOS>
honor
may
be
conceived
,
but
scarcely
described
,
as
the
door
at
thismoment
was
opened
,
pinning
him
against
the
wall
behind
it
,
and
theofficer
who
was
conducting
the
search
,
put
his
head
into
the
room
,
saying,—“No
alarm
,
I
suppose?”“None
,
”
said
the
mother
.
<EOS>
“Good
night
,
<EOS>
ma’am
.
<EOS>
We
have
not
got
him
yet
,
but
he
can
not
escape

<EOS>
Ihope
your
little
one
will
get
better

”“Thank
<EOS>
you
,

she
said
,
faintly
.
<EOS>
The
door
closed
again
,
and
the
heavy
tread
of
the
men
going
down
stairssounded
in
the
ears
of
Jacob
Gray
like
a
reprieve
from
immediateexecution
.
<EOS>
His
state
of
mind
while
the
officer
was
speaking
was
of
the
mostagonising
description
,
as
one
step
into
the
room
of
that
personage
,
orone
glance
towards
him
of
the
young
woman
’s
eye
,
must
have
discoveredhim
,
and
it
would
have
been
but
a
poor
satisfaction
even
to
such
a
mindas
Jacob
Gray
<EOS>
’s
,
to
have
taken
the
life
of
the
infant
,
even
if
he
hadthe
nerve
to
do
it
,
which
he
certainly
had
not
,
although
a
mother’sfears
would
not
permit
her
to
run
the
risk
.
<EOS>
“Tell
me
now
,
”
said
Gray
,
when
he
could
speak
,
for
his
fright
hadalmost
taken
away
his
breath
,
“
tell
me
who
lives
up
stairs
in
thishouse?”“I
<EOS>
know
not
,
”
replied
the
woman
,
“
I
am
but
a
stranger
here

<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
—
and
you
are
sure
your

would
not
protect
me?”“A
murderer
and
the
threatener
of

have
littleindeed

way

from

left
the
house
,
”
muttered
Gray
;
“
will
you
betray
me
by
analarm
when
I
leave
you?”“Let
<EOS>
Heaven
punish
you
in
its
own
good
time
,
”
replied
the
young
female
.
<EOS>
“Base
and
guilty
as
you
are
,
I
will
not
have
your
blood
upon
my
head
.
<EOS>
”“You
will
be
silent?”“I
will
strive
to
forget
you
.
<EOS>
”“Then
<EOS>
I
go
,
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
—
I
think
I
am
safer
away
,
as
you
are
sure
your
husbandwill
not
take
a
hundred
gold
pieces
to
protect
and
save
me
.
<EOS>
”Gray
<EOS>
glanced
at
the
woman
as
he
named
the
sum
of
money
,
to
see
whateffect
it
had
upon
her
,
but
there
was
nothing
but
a
shudder
of
disgust
,
and
he
gave
up
all
hope
of
purchasing
safety
from
her
.
<EOS>
Without
another
word
,
he
cautiously
opened
the
door
,
and
listened
.
<EOS>
Allwas
comparatively
quiet
,
and
he
passed
from
the
room
.
<EOS>
In
a
moment
he
heard
it
locked
behind
him
in
the
inside
,
and
his
placeof
refuge
was
at
once
cut
off
.
<EOS>
“Curses
on
her
,
”
he
muttered
.
<EOS>
“
She
may
have
no
husband
coming
afterall
.
<EOS>
What
can
I
do
to
free
myself
from
the
mazes
of
these
courts?Ada
—
Ada
—
if
ever
we
meet
again
,
I
will
have
a
deep
—
a
bloody
revenge
onthee
.
<EOS>
Beware
of
Jacob
Gray!”He
shook
his
clenched
hand
as
he
spoke
,
and
ground
his
teeth
withconcentrated
anger
.
<EOS>
The
question
now
was
whether
to
ascend
or
descendin
the
house
,
and
after
some
moments
of
anxious
consideration
,
hethought
his
better
chance
would
be
to
descend
,
and
make
an
effort
topass
himself
as
one
of
the
crowd
which
had
come
from
the
Strand
inpursuit
of
the
murderer
.
<EOS>
He
wiped
the
blood
,
as
he
thought
,
well
from
his
hands
,
and
the
dustand
mud
from
his
face
;
then
arranging
his
disordered
apparel
,
hefancied
he
might
pass
muster
without
much
suspicion
,
as
he
wasconfident
none
of
those
who
followed
him
could
have
obtained
more
thana
transitory
glance
at
him
.
<EOS>
He
then
carefully
groped
his
way
in
the
pitchy
darkness
to
the
top
ofthe
stairs
and
began
slowly
to
descend
.
<EOS>
It
was
many
minutes
before
he
reached
the
passage
,
and
when
he
did
,
hefelt
for
the
wall
of
the
passage
,
and
glided
along
it
towards
the
opendoorway
.
<EOS>
As
he
neared
it
,
he
heard
two
persons
conversing
,
and
the
theme
oftheir
conversation
struck
a
chill
to
his
heart
.
<EOS>
“Yes
,
you
may
pass
in
,
”
said
a
voice
;
“
my
orders
are
to
let
nobody
out
.
<EOS>
We
are
hunting
up
a
fellow
who
has
committed
a
murder
.
<EOS>
”“Indeed!”“Yes
.
<EOS>
If
the
people
in
the
parlour
here
know
you
,
you
can
pass
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
live
in
the
house
,
”
said
the
other
speaker
,
“
they
will
recognise
medirectly
.
<EOS>
”Some
<EOS>
little
bustle
now
ensued
,
and
a
third
voice
<EOS>
inquired,—“Do
you
know
this
person
?
”
said
the
person
who
was
keeping
guard
.
<EOS>
“Oh
<EOS>
yes
,
”
was
the
reply
,
“
he
lives
up
stairs
.
<EOS>
”“Very
<EOS>
well
.
<EOS>
Sorry
to
have
detained
you
sir
.
”“Never
<EOS>
mind
<EOS>
that
<EOS>
;
I
hope
you
may
catch
the
scoundrel
.
”Jacob
<EOS>
Gray
shrank
as
close
to
the
wall
as
he
could
,
and
some
onebrushed
quite
against
him
in
passing
along
the
passage
,
without
,
however
,
noticing
him
,
although
the
imminent
danger
almost
made
himfaint
upon
the
spot
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
LIV.The
<EOS>
Staircase.—The
<EOS>
Old
Attic.—A
Friend
in
Need.—Fair
Play.—Gray’sDespair
.
<EOS>
For
several
moments
now
Gray
stood
in
the
passage
quite
incapable
ofthought
or
action
;
his
only
impulse
was
by
a
kind
of
natural
instinctto
stand
as
close
to
the
damp
passage
wall
<EOS>
as
he
possibly
could
,
todecrease
the
chances
of
any
one
seeing
him
or
touching
him
in
the
actof
passing
.
<EOS>
His
brain
seemed
to
be
in
a
complete
whirl
,
and
many
minutes
must
haveelapsed
before
he
acquired
a
sufficient
calmness
to
reflect
with
anydegree
of
rationality
upon
his
present
very
precarious
position
.
<EOS>
When
he
could
think
,
his
terrors
by
no
means
decreased
;
for
whatplausible
course
of
action
was
there
now
open
to
him
,
as
he
could
notleave
the
house
?
<EOS>
The
thought
then
occurred
to
him
,
that
if
he
couldmake
his
way
into
the
cellars
,
he
might
have
a
chance
of
lyingconcealed
until
the
guard
at
the
door
was
removed
,
and
with
thisfeeling
he
crept
along
the
passage
,
with
the
hope
of
finding
somestaircase
leading
to
the
lower
part
of
the
premises
.
<EOS>
He
was
still
engaged
in
this
task
when
the
door
of
a
room
leading
intothe
passage
suddenly
opened
,
and
a
flood
of
light
immediatelydissipated
the
pitchy
darkness
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
for
him
,
Gray
was
within
one
pace
of
the
bottom
of
thestaircase
he
had
so
recently
descended
;
and
,
with
the
fear
of
instantdiscovery
upon
his
mind
,
from
the
person
who
was
coming
with
the
light
,
he
bounded
up
the
staircase
,
nor
paused
till
he
reached
the
firstlanding
,
<EOS>
from
whence
he
had
entered
the
room
containing
the
mother
andher
child
.
<EOS>
There
he
stopped
;
but
,
to
his
extreme
fright
,
the
flashing
of
the
lightevidently
indicated
that
its
bearer
was
coming
up
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
With
astifled
groan
Gray
cautiously
ascended
the
next
flight
,
and
againpaused
on
the
narrow
landing
.
<EOS>
Still
the
light
came
on
,
and
he
could
not
conceal
from
himself
the
factthat
the
person
was
still
ascending
,
and
that
he
had
no
other
resourcethan
to
continue
his
flight
to
the
very
upper
part
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Thenext
flight
of
stairs
was
steep
,
narrow
,
and
crazy
,
so
that
,
treadwhere
he
would
,
they
wheezed
,
creaked
,
and
groaned
under
the
pressureof
his
feet
.
<EOS>
There
was
,
however
,
no
resource
,
and
onward
he
went
,
until
he
wasstopped
by
a
door
exactly
at
the
top
:
<EOS>
he
pressed
it
,
and
it
yielded
tohis
touch
,
allowing
him
to
enter
a
dark
attic
.
<EOS>
Further
progress
Jacob
Gray
felt
there
could
not
be
,
and
he
stood
inthe
doorway
,
listening
attentively
if
he
could
detect
any
sounds
ofapproaching
feet
.
<EOS>
A
gush
of
blood
to
his
heart
,
and
an
universal
tremor
of
all
his
limbs
,
seized
him
as
he
saw
the
light
coming
,
and
felt
convinced
that
thedestination
of
the
person
approaching
was
one
of
the
attics
,
if
not
thevery
one
he
had
sought
refuge
in
.
<EOS>
All
hope
appeared
to
die
within
him
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
time
for
the
briefest
reflection
.
<EOS>
With
his
eyes
fixed
uponthe
door
,
and
the
pistol
in
his
grasp
,
he
retreated
backwards
into
theroom
as
the
footsteps
came
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
Then
there
was
a
slight
pause
;
after
which
the
door
was
flung
open
,
anda
tall
,
heavy
,
coarse
-
looking
man
entered
the
room
,
carrying
in
hishand
a
light
.
<EOS>
One
glance
convinced
Jacob
Gray
that
the
man
was
by
far
his
superior
instrength
—
<EOS>
his
only
chance
lay
in
the
loaded
pistol
he
had
,
and
that
hewas
resolved
to
use
should
he
not
be
able
to
bribe
the
man
to
conniveat
his
presence
,
and
aid
his
escape
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
moment
before
the
man
observed
the
figure
of
Jacob
Gray
withhis
back
to
the
wall
opposite
to
the
door
,
and
the
pistol
in
his
grasp
.
<EOS>
When
he
did
,
he
by
no
means
betrayed
the
emotion
that
might
have
beenexpected
;
but
shading
the
light
with
his
disengaged
hand
,
he
cried
in
aloud
voice,—“Hilloa
!
<EOS>
Who
are
you
when
you
are
at
home?”“Do
you
love
gold
?
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“Rather
,
”
replied
the
man
.
<EOS>
“Will
<EOS>
it
tempt
you
to
assist
me
to
escape
from
this
place
?
<EOS>
If
so
,
nameyour
price
.
<EOS>
”“That
<EOS>
’s
business
like
,
”
said
the
man
.
<EOS>
“
I
suppose
it
’s
you
they
aremaking
all
the
rout
about
below
there?”“It
is
.
<EOS>
They
are
hunting
me
,
and
,
with
your
assistance
,
I
may
yetescape
.
<EOS>
”“The
devil
doubt
it
.
<EOS>
Curse
me
if
I
do
n’t
actually
love
you
.
<EOS>
Why
,
I
havebeen
poking
about
for
this
half
hour
to
do
you
a
good
turn
.
”“Is
<EOS>
that
possible?”“To
be
sure
.
<EOS>
Why
that
fellow
,
whose
crown
you
have
cracked
sohandsomely
below
there
,
was
the
pest
of
all
the
cracksmen
in
theneighbourhood
.
<EOS>
I
love
you
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
.
<EOS>
”“Then
<EOS>
you
are—”“Jem
Batter
,
the
cracksman
.
<EOS>
”“Then
<EOS>
you
will
befriend
me?”“In
course
—
though
hang
me
if
I
know
you
.
<EOS>
I
thought
I
knew
all
the
handson
town
;
but
I
never
clapped
eyes
on
your
paste
-
pot
of
a
mug
before
.
<EOS>
”Gray
replaced
his
pistol
,
as
he
assumed
a
sickly
smile
,
and
said,—“Then
I
have
really
found
a
friend?”“A
friend
!
<EOS>
Ah
,
to
be
sure
you
have
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
’ll
tell
you
what
we
’ll
do
.
<EOS>
We’ll
wait
till
the
enemy
is
gone
,
and
then
I
’ll
poke
you
out
on
theroof
,
and
you
can
get
in
at
Bill
Splasher
’s
attic
.
<EOS>
It
’s
only
across
adozen
houses
or
so
.
<EOS>
He
’ll
let
you
out
then
by
the
cellars
of
SomersetHouse
,
and
you
’ll
be
as
safe
as
any
gentleman
need
wish
to
be
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
thank
you
,
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
I
am
now
faint
and
weary
.
<EOS>
”“Sit
down
then
,
”
cried
the
man
.
<EOS>
“
Do
n’t
stand
upon
ceremony
here
.
<EOS>
Isuppose
you
’ve
been
at
some
fakement
of
value
—
<EOS>
eh?”“Yes
,
<EOS>
yes
—
a
robbery
,
”
said
Gray
,
who
thought
it
best
to
fall
in
withthe
humour
of
his
new
friend
.
<EOS>
“Plenty
<EOS>
o
’
<EOS>
swag?”“A
trifle
,
a
mere
trifle
.
”“Never
<EOS>
mind
,
better
luck
next
time
,
”
cried
the
man
dealing
Gray
anencouraging
blow
upon
the
back
that
nearly
took
his
breath
away
.
<EOS>
“Thank
you
,
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
The
thief
,
for
such
indeed
he
was
,
now
proceeded
to
a
cupboard
,
andhanded
to
Gray
therefrom
a
bottle
covered
with
protective
wicker
-
work
,
saying,—“Drink
;
you
’ll
find
that
the
best
stuff
.
<EOS>
”Gray
took
a
hearty
draught
of
the
contents
,
which
consisted
ofexceedingly
strong
raw
spirit
.
<EOS>
“Don’t
you
feel
better
?
”
<EOS>
said
the
man
.
<EOS>
“Yes
,
”
replied
Gray
,
“
a
great
deal
better
.
<EOS>
”“Very
<EOS>
good
.
<EOS>
Now
,
you
see
,
short
reckonings
make
long
friends
.
<EOS>
”“What
<EOS>
do
you
mean?”“Oh
,
you
know
the
reg’lar
terms
of
business
.
<EOS>
It
’s
share
and
share
alikewith
all
who
help
a
lame
dog
over
a
stile
.
<EOS>
”“I
am
quite
willing
,
”
said
Gray
,
“
to
award—”“Oh
,
bother
award
,
”
interrupted
the
other
;
<EOS>
“
I
’m
above
it
.
<EOS>
Do
you
thinkI’d
take
anything
<EOS>
but
my
rights
of
lending
a
hand
to
help
a
poor
fellowwhen
the
bull
dogs
are
on
his
track
?
<EOS>
No
,
sink
me!”“You
<EOS>
are
very
kind

”
said
Gray
,
“
but
still—”“Still
,
nonsense

<EOS>
There
’s
you

me
,
and
there
will
be
Bill

and
Bill’syoung

<EOS>
Share

”“Share?”“Yes

the

<EOS>
Come

honour
bright
,
now
produce
it
,
will
<EOS>
you?”“Really

I

I—”“Do
you
doubt
my

<EOS>
cried
the
ruffian
.
<EOS>
“
If

why
do
n’t
yousay
so
<EOS>
,
you
sneak
?
<EOS>
Take
my
life
,
but
do
n’t
doubt
my
honour!”Gray
<EOS>
’s
hand
mechanically
moved
towards
his
breast
for
his
pistol
,
butbefore
<EOS>
he
could
reach
it
the
brawny
hand
of
the
man
was
upon
histhroat
,
and
holding
Gray
as
if
he
had
been
an
infant
in
his
herculeangrasp
,
he
himself
took
the
pistol
from
him
and
put
it
in
his
ownpocket
,
saying,—“Thank
you
,
<EOS>
I
’ll
mind
it
for
you
.
<EOS>
”“Let
me
<EOS>
go
,
”
gasped
Gray
.
<EOS>
“Then
<EOS>
you
do
n’t
doubt
my
honour?”“No
,
no
—
certainly
not
.
”“Oh
,
<EOS>
very
well
,
I
thought
you
did
n’t
mean
it
.
<EOS>
”Gray
was
then
liberated
from
the
grasp
which
came
within
one
degree
ofsuffocation
,
and
he
said,—“I
will
be
candid
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
forty
pounds
with
me
,
which
I
willdivide
as
you
propose
.
”“Forty
?
<EOS>
Humph
!
<EOS>
It
’s
d
—
<EOS>
d
little
;
<EOS>
but
I
hate
all
grumbling
.
<EOS>
We
ca
n’t
havemore
than
a
cat
and
her
skin
,
say
I.”“No
,
certainly
,
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
I
did
n’t
understand
you
at
first
you
see
,
or
I
should
never
have
for
a
moment
hesitated
.
”“Oh
,
<EOS>
it
’s
all
right
—
it
’s
all
right
.
<EOS>
Never
say
die
,
sink
me
.
<EOS>
”“That’ll
be
ten
pounds
each
,
”
remarked
Gray
,
who
really
,
as
we
know
,
had
a
very
large
sum
about
him
—
a
sum
<EOS>
so
large
indeed
as
materially
tohave
inconvenienced
him
in
his
race
down
the
Strand
.
<EOS>
“So
<EOS>
it
will
,
”
replied
the
man
.
<EOS>
“
Now
,
you
know
the
rules

my
covey

aswell
as
I
do
<EOS>

I
dare

say?”“What
rules?”“Why

you

No

LV.The
Escape

Houses.—Many
Perils.—Gray
’s
Great
Sufferings.—TheGuide
Rope
.
<EOS>
Gray
was
silent
for
some
moments
,
then
,
with
,
a
deep
groan
<EOS>
,
he
droppedhis
head
upon
his
hands
,
and
gave
himself
up
to
a
bitterness
of
anguishthat
must
have
both
alarmed
and
melted
any
heart
but
the
stubborn
oneof
the
man
who
now
had
him
in
his
power
.
<EOS>
“All
I
have
struggled
for
,
”
thought
Gray—“all
that
I
have
dipped
myhands
in
blood
for
is
about
to
be
wrested
from
me
for
the
mere
doubtfulboon
of
existence
.
<EOS>
”At
<EOS>
that
awful
moment
of
misery
<EOS>
he
did
indeed
feel
that
he
had
chosenthe
wrong
path
in
life
,
and
the
gaudy
flowers
which
had
lured
him
fromthe
right
road
of
virtue
to
the
intricate
one
of
crime
and
deepiniquity
,
were
but
delusion
,
and
had
vanished
,
now
leaving
him
awanderer
in
a
region
of
dissolution
and
gaunt
despair
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
what
wouldhe
have
not
given
in
that
awful
moment
,
when
busy
memory
conjured
upall
his
crimes
before
him
in
frightful
array
,
to
have
been
the
veriestbeggar
that
ever
crept
for
alms
from
door
to
door
,
so
that
he
couldhave
said
,
“
I
am
innocent
of
great
wrong
—
I
have
shed
no
man
<EOS>
’s
blood!”It
might
be
that
the
evident
mortal
agony
of
Jacob
Gray
really
had
someeffect
even
upon
the
hardened
and
obdurate
heart
of
his
companion
,
forit
was
several
minutes
before
he
spoke
,
and
then
when
he
did
,
his
voicewas
scarcely
so
harshly
tuned
as
before
,
and
it
is
probable
<EOS>
he
meant
tooffer
something
very
consolatory
<EOS>
when
he
said,—“Snivelling
be
bothered
,
I
have
cracked
never
so
many
cribs
,
and
Inever
gaved
up
to
the
enemy
yet
.
<EOS>
Keep
up
your
heart
,
old
’
un
,
you’lllight
on
your
feet
yet
,
like
a
cat
as
is
shied
out
o
’
a
attic
window
.
<EOS>
”Gray
only
groaned
and
shook
his
head
.
<EOS>
“Now
,
I
tell
you
what
I
’ll
do
for
you
,
”
continued
the
man
,
“
you
shallgo
into
partnership
with
me
,
and
we
’ll
do
a
lot
o
’
work
together
.
<EOS>
You’ve
got
a
good
sneaking
sort
o
’
face
that
’ll
gammon
the
flats
.
<EOS>
Youcan
poke
about
and
insinuate
where
family
plate
and
such
like
things
iskept
,
and
then
I
’ll
go
and
crack
the
cribs
.
<EOS>
Do
n’t
be
groaning
here
.
<EOS>
”The
robber
then
gave
Gray
another
encouraging
blow
upon
the
back
,
whicheffectually
prevented
him
from
groaning
for
some
minutes
,
by
leavinghim
no
breath
to
groan
with
.
<EOS>
Gray
then
looked
up
,
and
,
glancing
in
theface
of
the
man
he
said,—“I
will
own
to
you
that
I
have
about
me
a
larger
sum
than
I
at
firstnamed
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
know’d
it
,
”
cried
the
man
,
“
I
know’d
—
you
white
-
mugged
fellers
alwayshas
larger
sums
than
they
names
.
<EOS>
”“In
<EOS>
one
word
,
”
said
Gray
,
“
I
have
two
hundred
pounds
.
<EOS>
Will
you
take
onehundred
and
leave
me
at
liberty
to
go
from
here
when
the
ardour
ofpursuit
has
abated?”“Without
the
search?”“Yes
.
<EOS>
Without
the
search
.
<EOS>
You
talk
of
your
honour
—
why
not
rely
uponmine?”“’Cos
I
’m
a
known
gentleman
,
and
you
is
n’t
,
”
replied
the
fellow
.
<EOS>
“
Myword
’s
respected
all
through
the
profession
.
<EOS>
If
I
say
I
’ll
crack
thatcrib
,
I
goes
and
cracks
it
.
<EOS>
”“Exactly
.
<EOS>
You
will
agree
to
my
terms?”“Why
,
you
see
,
I
’m
rather
awkwardly
situated
just
now
.
<EOS>
It
is
n’t
safefor
you
to
go
out
by
the
way
you
came
in
.
<EOS>
You
may
think
it
is
,
but
Ican
tell
you
it
is
n’t
.
<EOS>
The
people
down
stairs
have
had
a
cool
hundredoffered
for
nabbing
you
,
and
ai
n’t
they
on
the
look
-
out?”“A
hundred?”“Yes
.
<EOS>
You
see
that
’s
all
you
offer
me
.
<EOS>
Now
there
<EOS>
’s
Bill
’s
attic
to
payfor
,
and
Bill
’s
young
woman
.
<EOS>
”Gray
replied
by
a
groan
.
<EOS>
“There
<EOS>
you
go
,
now
,
groaning
away
.
<EOS>
It
’s
well
for
you
that
you
’ve
fellamong
people
with
fine
feelings
,
and
all
that
sort
o
’
thing
.
<EOS>
Some
folksnow
,
as
know’d
as
much
as
<EOS>
,
I
’m
pretty
sure
,
I
know
,
would
put
a
knifein
your
guts
.
<EOS>
”“What
<EOS>
—
what
—
do
—
you
know
?
”
<EOS>
stammered
Gray
,
shivering
at
the
very
idea
ofsuch
a
process
.
<EOS>
“What
<EOS>
do
I
know
?
<EOS>
Why
,
I
know
you
are
trying
to
deceive
a
gentleman
.
You’ve
got
more
money
<EOS>
then
you
’ll
own
to
,
you
know
you
have
.
<EOS>
”“You
wrong
me
.
<EOS>
Indeed
you
do
.
<EOS>
”“Well
<EOS>
,
well
,
I
’ll
take
Bill
’s
opinion
.
<EOS>
He
’s
better
nor
all
the
lawyersin
London
,
is
Bill
.
<EOS>
If
he
says
as
it
’s
all
right
<EOS>
and
we
are
to
take
thehundred
only
<EOS>
,
I
consents
.
<EOS>
Now
,
my
covey
,
I
’ll
trouble
you
to
come
withme
to
Bill
’s
attic
.
<EOS>
”“But
<EOS>
can
we
go
without
danger
?
<EOS>
The
people
down
stairs
,
you
say
,
are
onthe
watch
.
<EOS>
”“Let
<EOS>
’em
watch
<EOS>
—
we
ai
n’t
a
-
going
down
stairs
.
<EOS>
The
window
’s
the
thing
forus
.
”“Is
<EOS>
it
<EOS>
the
next
house?”“No
,
it
isn’t
—
nor
the
next
arter
<EOS>
that
either
—
but
it
’s
all
the
safer
forthat
.
<EOS>
You
’ve
got
a
few
roofs
to
get
over
,
but
I
know
’em
<EOS>
if
well
as
<EOS>
Iknow
my
own
pocket
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
man
then
opened
the
small
latticed
window
of
the
room
and
lookedout
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Then
,
with
a
satisfied
tone
,
he
said,—“It
’s
a
regular
dark
night
.
<EOS>
There
ai
n’t
a
shadow
o
’
fear
.
<EOS>
”“You
think
I
shall
<EOS>
escape?”“I
know
it
.
<EOS>
I
’ve
said
it
.
<EOS>
Think
o
’
my
honour
.
”He
<EOS>
then
took
from
an
old
chest
a
coil
of
very
thick
rope
,
in
one
end
ofwhich
he
busied
himself
in
making
a
noose
,
which
,
when
he
hadcompleted
,
he
advanced
with
it
to
Gray
,
saying,—“Just
pop
your
head
through
.
”“Gracious
<EOS>
Heavens
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Gray
,
starting
up
.
<EOS>
“
What
do
you
mean?”“Mean
?
<EOS>
Why
to
take
care
of
you
to
be
sure
;
I
know
the
way
over
theroofs
,
but
you
do
n’t
.
<EOS>
You
’ll
smash
yourself
in
some
of
the
courtswithout
a
guide
rope
,
you
will
.
<EOS>
”“A
guide
rope?”“Yes
.
<EOS>
Do
n’t
be
making
those
faces
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
I
’m
going
to
hang
<EOS>
you?”“Oh
no
<EOS>
—
no
,
”
said
Gray
,
with
a
nervous
smile
.
<EOS>
“
No
—
certainly
.
”“I
would
n’t
do
such
a
ungentlemanly
thing
.
<EOS>
Poke
your
head
through
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
man
accompanied
these
words
by
seizing
Gray
by
the
hair
andthrusting
his
head
into
the
noose
,
which
then
he
passed
over
hisshoulder
down
to
his
waist
.
<EOS>
“There
<EOS>
you
are
now
,
”
he
said
,
“
as
safe
as
if
you
was
a
diamond
incotton
.
<EOS>
Now
,
mind
you
,
I
go
first
,
and
you
follow
arter
.
<EOS>
You
keepcoming
on
in
the
line
of
the
rope
,
you
understand
,
as
long
as
you
feelme
tugging
at
it
;
you
are
sure
to
be
safe
if
you
follow
the
rope
,
butso
certain
as
you
do
n’t
down
<EOS>
you
’ll
go
either
into
some
of
the
yards
o’the
houses
,
or
into
some
o
’
the
open
courts
.
<EOS>
”“I
understand
,
”
said
Gray
,
who
felt
anything
<EOS>
but
pleasantly
situatedwith
a
thick
rope
round
his
middle
,
by
which
he
was
to
be
hauled
overroofs
of
old
houses
.
<EOS>
There
was
,
however
,
no
alternative
,
and
he
stroveto
assume
an
air
of
composure
and
confidence
,
which
sat
but
ill
uponhim
,
and
the
ghastly
smile
which
<EOS>
he
forced
his
face
to
assume
,
lookedlike
some
hideous
contortion
of
the
muscles
produced
by
pain
,
ratherthan
an
indication
that
the
heart
was
at
ease
within
him
.
<EOS>
The
housebreaker
now
took
the
coil
of
rope
in
his
hand
,
leaving
alength
between
him
and
Jacob
Gray
of
about
three
yards
merely
,
and
thenhe
nimbly
got
out
at
the
window
.
<EOS>
“Follow
<EOS>
,
”
he
said
to
Gray
,
“
and
mind
ye
now
<EOS>
,
if
you
say
anything
untilyou
are
spoken
to
by
me
,
I
’ll
let
you
down
.
<EOS>
”Trembling
<EOS>
and
alarmed
,
Gray
scrambled
out
at
the
window
,
and
foundhimself
standing
,
or
rather
crouching
in
a
narrow
gutter
,
full
of
slimeand
filth
,
and
only
protected
from
falling
by
a
narrow
coping
,
whichcut
and
scratched
his
ankles
as
he
moved
.
<EOS>
His
guide
crept
on
slowly
and
cautiously
,
and
Gray
followed
guided
bythe
rope
,
which
every
now
and
then
was
pulled
very
tight
with
a
jerk
,
that
at
first
very
nearly
upset
him
over
the
parapet
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
cold
raw
air
blowing
over
the
house
tops
,
but
Gray
’s
fearsproduced
a
heavy
perspiration
upon
him
,
and
he
shook
excessively
fromsheer
fright
at
the
idea
of
a
false
step
precipitating
him
to
a
greatdepth
on
to
some
stone
pavement
,
where
he
would
lay
a
hideous
mass
ofbroken
bones
.
<EOS>
Tug
,
tug
,
went
the
rope
,
and
now
Jacob
Gray
felt
the
strain
come
in
anupward
direction
.
<EOS>
He
crawled
on
,
and
presently
found
that
the
ropeascended
a
sloping
roof
of
slates
,
which
at
the
first
dim
sight
of
it
,
struck
him
he
would
have
the
greatest
difficulty
in
ascending
.
<EOS>
He
wasnot
,
however
,
left
long
to
his
reflections
,
for
a
sudden
tug
at
therope
which
brought
him
with
his
face
in
violent
contact
with
thesloping
roof
,
admonished
him
that
his
guide
was
getting
ratherimpatient
.
<EOS>
With
something
between
a
curse
and
a
groan
,
he
commenced
the
slipperyand
difficult
ascent
,
which
,
however
,
by
the
aid
of
the
rope
,
heaccomplished
with
greater
ease
than
he
had
anticipated
.
<EOS>
It
happened
that
Gray
,
in
the
confusion
of
his
mind
,
did
not
at
alltake
into
consideration
that
the
sloping
roof
might
have
a
side
todescend
as
well
as
one
to
ascend
,
so
that
when
he
arrived
at
itssummit
,
he
rolled
over
and
came
down
with
great
speed
into
a
gutter
onthe
other
side
,
and
partially
upon
the
back
of
his
guide
,
who
,
with
amuttered
accusation
of
an
awful
character
,
seized
him
by
the
throat
andheld
down
,
in
the
gutter
upon
his
back
to
the
imminent
risk
of
hisstrangulation
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
that
Gray
’s
fall
had
given
some
kind
of
alarm
,
for
in
amoment
an
attic
window
at
some
distance
was
opened
with
a
creakingsound
,
and
the
voice
of
a
female
cried,—“Gracious
me
,
what
’s
that?”“Hush
,
for
your
life
,
hush
,
”
whispered
the
man
in
Gray
’s
ear
.
<EOS>
“Well
<EOS>
,
I
never
did
hear
such
a
rumpus
,
”
said
the
woman
’s
voice
.
<EOS>
“
It’sthose
beastly
cats
again
.
<EOS>
”She
<EOS>
had
no
sooner
uttered
this
suggestion
,
than
Gray
’s
companionperpetrated
so
excellent
an
imitation
of
a
cat
mewing
,
that
Gray
wasfor
a
moment
taken
in
it
himself
.
<EOS>
“Ah
,
there
you
are
,
”
said
the
woman
;
<EOS>
“
I
only
wish
I
was
near
you
.
<EOS>
Puss
—
puss
—
puss
.
<EOS>
”This
<EOS>
call
from
the
woman
was
a
hypocritical
one
,
and
evidently
intendedto
deceive
the
supposed
cat
or
cats
to
their
serious
personal
detrimentshould
they
venture
to
the
window
allured
by
such
pacific
sounds
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
pause
of
some
moments
,
<EOS>
then
the
woman
exclaimed,—“Oh
,
you
artful
wretches
<EOS>
;
I
declare
these
cats
are
as
knowing
asChristians
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
attic
window
was
then
shut
with
a
very
aggravated
bang
,
and
Gray’scompanion
took
his
hand
from
his
throat
as
he
said
to
him,—“Curse
you
,
what
the
devil
made
you
come
down
the
slope
with
such
arun?““I
<EOS>
—
I
did
n’t
know
it
,
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“Come
on
and
mind
what
you
are
about
.
<EOS>
I
did
n’t
think
you
were
soprecious
green
as
you
are
;
come
on
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
fellow
crept
on
ahead
,
and
a
tug
at
the
rope
caused
Gray
to
follow
,
which
he
did
;
so
weak
from
terror
and
exhaustion
that
he
could
scarcelycontrive
to
keep
up
with
his
guide
,
and
numerous
were
the
falls
hereceived
,
<EOS>
as
a
sudden
pull
of
the
rope
rebuked
his
tardy
progress
.
<EOS>
Altogether
,
it
was
,
to
Jacob
Gray
,
an
awful
means
of
safety
,
if
safetywas
to
be
the
result
of
it
.
<EOS>
They
proceeded
along
the
gutter
they
were
in
until
they
came
to
thecorner
house
of
the
court
,
to
turn
which
was
no
easy
matter
,
from
thecircumstance
of
the
coping
stones
ceasing
each
way
,
at
about
a
footfrom
the
absolute
corner
,
down
to
which
the
roof
came
with
a
point
.
<EOS>
Round
this
point
the
housebreaker
stepped
with
ease
,
but
to
Gray
,
oppressed
as
his
mind
was
with
fears
and
terrors
,
and
weakened
andexhausted
as
he
was
from
his
recent
unusual
bodily
exertion
,
it
was
atask
of
the
greatest
magnitude
and
terror
.
<EOS>
There
was
,
however
,
no
time
to
deliberate
,
and
it
was
,
perhaps
,
betterfor
Gray
that
such
was
the
case
,
for
his
mind
was
not
in
that
state
toreason
itself
out
of
nervous
apprehensions
.
<EOS>
A
sharp
tug
of
the
rope
settled
his
cogitations
,
and
clinging
with
hishands
to
the
angle
of
the
roof
<EOS>
,
he
placed
his
leg
round
the
corner
.
<EOS>
Itwas
then
a
moment
or
two
before
he
could
find
,
with
his
foot
,
thecoping
stones
on
the
other
side
,
and
those
few
moments
seemed
to
himhours
of
intense
agony
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
gained
a
hold
with
his
foot
,
andrubbing
his
very
face
against
the
roof
for
fear
of
overbalancinghimself
in
the
outer
direction
,
he
contrived
to
get
round
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
a
deadly
sickness
came
over
him
,
when
he
had
accomplishedthe
,
to
him
,
difficult
feat
;
then
he
felt
as
if
he
could
have
nothingelse
to
fear
,
and
a
feeling
of
congratulation
sprang
up
in
his
mind
,
that
after
all
he
might
not
only
escape
,
but
preserve
the
greater
partof
the
large
sum
he
had
about
him

CHAPTER
LVI.The

Robbers.—The
Drugged
Wine.—Visions
of
the
Mind
Diseased
.
<EOS>
The
path
over
the
house
tops
now
continued
for
upwards
of
a
quarter
ofan
hour
,
without
presenting
any
very
extraordinary
difficulties
toJacob
Gray
,
and
he
was
about
to
congratulate
himself
that
really
theworst
was
past
,
when
the
rope
suddenly
slackened
,
and
in
a
few
momentshis
guide
was
by
his
side
.
<EOS>
“You
can
jump
a
bit
,
I
suppose
?
”
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
“Jump
?
<EOS>
Jump?”“Yes
,
jump
.
<EOS>
What
the
devil
do
you
repeat
my
words
for?”“I
—
am
no
greater
jumper
,
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
Where
am
I
to
jump?”“Across
this
court
.
”“Across
<EOS>
a
court
?
<EOS>
I
cannot
—
<EOS>
I
cannot
.
<EOS>
”“You
must
.
<EOS>
”“I
am
lost
—
I
am
lost
,
”
said
Gray
,
wringing
his
hands
,
for
the
feat
ofjumping
across
a
court
at
the
risk
of
a
fall
into
the
gulph
below
<EOS>
,
appeared
to
him
to
be
totally
impossible
.
<EOS>
“Well
,
”
cried
the
man
,
“
if
ever
I
came
near
such
an
out
-
and
-
out
sneakin
the
whole
course
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
Why
you
are
afraid
of
what
you
knownothing
about
.
<EOS>
You
’ve
only
got
to
jump
off
a
parapet
of
one
house
in
atBill
’s
attic
window
opposite
.
<EOS>
”“Only
,
”
said
Gray
,
trembling
exceedingly
.
<EOS>
“
Do
you
call
that
easy?”“Yes
;
and
if
you
do
n’t
jump
it
,
I
must
just
ease
you
of
all
you
havegot
in
the
money
way
on
the
roofs
here
,
and
leave
you
to
your
luck
.
<EOS>
”Gray
looked
despairingly
around
him
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
hope
for
him
.
<EOS>
Hestood
in
a
drain
between
the
two
roofs
,
and
he
was
as
ignorant
of
thelocality
of
his
position
as
it
was
possible
to
be
.
<EOS>
With
a
deep
groan
hesunk
grovelling
at
the
feet
of
the
man
in
whose
power
he
was
,
and
inimploring
accents
he
said,—“Take
me
back
,
and
let
me
run
my
chance
of
escape
from
the
house
youlive
in
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
take
me
back
,
for
I
am
unequal
to
the
fearful
task
youpropose
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
,
indeed
—
I
should
falter
and
fall
—
<EOS>
I
know
I
should
.
<EOS>
Then
an
awful
death
would
be
my
lot
—
a
death
of
pain
and
horror
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
take
me
back
—
take
me
back!”“I’ll
<EOS>
see
you
d
—
<EOS>
d
first
,
”
cried
the
man
.
<EOS>
“
Come
on
,
or
I
’ll
cut
yourthroat
where
you
are
.
<EOS>
Come
on
,
I
say
,
you
whining
hound
,
come
on
,
andlook
at
the
jump
<EOS>
you
are
so
scared
at
afore
<EOS>
you
know
anything
about
it
.
<EOS>
Come
on
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
you
won’t?”“Spare
me
—
spare
me!”The
man
took
a
large
clasp
knife
from
his
pocket
and
opened
it
with
histeeth
.
<EOS>
“I’ll
go
—
<EOS>
I’ll
go
,
”
cried
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
Put
up
the
knife
—
oh
,
God
!
<EOS>
Put
up
theknife
—
any
death
but
that!”“Oh
!
<EOS>
Any
death
but
that
.
<EOS>
Then
it
’s
my
opinion
you
’ve
used
such
a
littlearticle
yourself
.
<EOS>
Speak!”“I
—
I
—
have
,
”
gasped
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
Take
it
out
of
my
sight
,
I
can
not
bear
tolook
upon
it
.
”“Oh
,
<EOS>
you
’re
a
tender
-
hearted
piece
of
goods
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
weall
have
our
little
failings
.
<EOS>
You
’ve
had
a
precious
fright
about
thisjump
,
and
now
I
tell
you
it
’s
no
jump
at
all
.
<EOS>
”“Indeed?”“No
.
<EOS>
These
houses
are
so
built
that
each
story
as
they
go
up
projectsoutwards
,
so
that
I
’m
cursed
if
you
could
n’t
shake
a
fist
with
a
palfrom
some
of
the
opposite
attic
windows
.
<EOS>
Come
on
,
now
,
spooney
,
andyou’ll
curse
yourself
for
a
fool
for
being
afraid
of
nothing
.
<EOS>
”“Is
<EOS>
it
indeed
as
you
say
,
”
muttered
Gray
,
who
still
could
not
get
overhis
great
terror
,
although
he
well
knew
that
hundreds
of
houses
innarrow
thoroughfares
in
London
were
so
situated
,
that
the
attics
hadscarcely
a
couple
of
yards
of
open
space
between
them
.
<EOS>
“Come
on
,
”
was
the
only
reply
,
accompanied
by
a
jerk
of
the
rope
,
andpresently
one
of
the
roofs
ceased
upon
one
side
,
and
turning
an
angle
,
Gray
,
by
the
very
dim
light
that
was
cast
upwards
from
the
street
,
sawthat
<EOS>
he
was
opposite
a
row
of
dirty
,
squalid
-
looking
attic
windows
,
from
some
of
which
lights
were
streaming
,
while
others
were
obscured
byold
clothes
hung
up
in
the
inside
.
<EOS>
A
very
few
steps
further
now
broughtthem
to
a
part
where
,
as
the
housebreaker
had
told
Gray
,
the
upperstory
of
the
house
on
the
top
of
which
they
were
,
projectedconsiderably
across
the
narrow
court
;
here
Gray
’s
guide
paused
,
andpointing
to
an
attic
immediately
opposite
,
he
said,—“There
—
that
’s
not
much
of
a
jump
.
<EOS>
”“No
<EOS>
,
no
,
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
I
could
do
that
.
<EOS>
”The
distance
was
scarcely
more
than
a
long
step
from
parapet
to
parapet
.
<EOS>
The
robber
now
slackened
out
some
of
the
rope
in
order
that
by
suddenlyjumping
across
the
chasm
he
might
not
drag
Gray
from
the
slightstanding
he
had
.
<EOS>
Then
,
with
the
remainder
of
the
rope
on
his
arm
,
hesprung
across
and
alighted
in
safety
in
the
gutter
of
the
oppositehouse
.
<EOS>
“Jump
now
,
”
he
said
to
Gray
.
<EOS>
The
distance
was
too
insignificant
to
give
occasion
for
fear
,
but
stillGray
barely
cleared
it
,
and
fell
in
the
drain
where
the
housebreakerwas
standing
.
<EOS>
“Well
,
”
said
the
latter
,
“
of
all
the
awkward
hands
at
business
<EOS>
thatever
<EOS>
I
saw
you
are
the
most
awkward
.
<EOS>
It
’s
well
for
you
there
<EOS>
’s
somebodyto
look
after
you
.
”He
<EOS>
then
undid
a
fastening
on
the
outside
of
the
attic
window
,
and
atonce
jumped
into
the
room
,
whither
he
was
followed
by
Gray
.
<EOS>
“You
remain
here
,
”
he
then
said
.
<EOS>
“
Do
n’t
stir
for
your
life
,
while
I
godown
stairs
to
speak
to
Bill
.
<EOS>
”“You
will
not
keep
me
here
long
?
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“Not
five
minutes
.
<EOS>
Make
no
noise
;
but
enjoy
yourself
as
well
as
youcan
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
man
now
left
Gray
to
his
meditations
after
carefully
locking
him
inthe
room
,
and
these
meditations
were
very
far
from
an
agreeable
orpleasant
charae
.
<EOS>
Gray
’s
first
idea
was
that
he
would
hide
the
money
he
had
about
himwith
the
exception
of
the
amount
he
had
averred
to
,
namely
,
two
hundredpound
,
but
then
it
naturally
occurred
to
him
how
extremely
improbableit
was
that
he
should
ever
have
an
opportunity
of
repossessing
himselfof
it
.
<EOS>
“Still
,
”
he
answered
,
with
his
usual
selfish
cunning
;
“
still
there
maybe
a
remote
,
although
a
very
remote
chance
;
and
,
at
all
events
,
if
Inever
see
it
again
myself
,
I
may
prevent
these
men
from
having
it
.
”Deep
<EOS>
groans
then
burst
from
him
,
and
he
smote
his
breast
as
the
thoughtcame
across
him
that
all
the
gold
he
had
wrung
from
the
guilty
fear
ofLearmont
,
and
hoarded
so
carefully
;
might
now
be
about
to
pass
from
himin
a
mass
never
again
to
bless
his
sight
.
<EOS>
“They
will
rob
me
—
they
will
rob
me
,
”
he
thought
,
and
compared
withthat
,
it
appeared
to
him
preferable
to
know
that
it
was
hidden
fromthem
and
undisposed
of
,
although
inaccessible
to
himself
.
<EOS>
How
and
where
to
conceal
it
then
became
the
object
,
and
he
felt
aboutin
the
dark
to
discover
some
loose
board
,
or
other
means
,
of
placinghis
ill
-
gotten
money
out
of
sight
—
where
,
for
all
he
knew
,
it
mightremain
until
the
coins
of
which
it
was
composed
,
became
blackened
intocuriosities
.
<EOS>
Such
,
however
,
was
not
to
be
the
fate
of
Learmont
’s
gold
,
for
whileGray
was
still
feeling
about
in
the
attic
for
a
place
of
security
inwhich
to
deposit
it
,
the
door
was
suddenly
opened
,
and
his
formercompanion
appeared
,
along
with
a
shorter
man
,
in
whose
countenance
,
nature
or
education
had
taken
especial
pains
to
stamp
villain!“Here
<EOS>
you
are

”
said
the
man
who
had
guided
Gray
across
the
roofs
.
<EOS>
“This
is
the
gentleman
,
Bill
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
an
awkward
fix
,
but
now

handsomely

Bill
,

<EOS>

replied
Bill
.
<EOS>
“
Your

”“Thank

said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“

coast

<EOS>
Can
I
go?”“Lor

<EOS>
replied
the
man
who
was
named
Bill
.
<EOS>
“
You

notventure

<EOS>
There
’s

in

we
can

”“Indeed

said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“Oh

Jim
Binks
comes

”“Why

is

continued
Bill
.
<EOS>
“
Jim

started

the
ruffian

Gray

<EOS>
“
The

”“Then

in
the
interval
I
can
leave

said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“You
<EOS>
can

But

”“Oh

”“What

<EOS>
cried
the
man
who
had
come
with
Gray

<EOS>
“I
think
it

said
the
other

<EOS>
“Well

then

that
’s
agreed

”“Thank

you

said
Gray
,
breathing
a
little
more
freely
atthe
idea
of
getting
off
with
nearly
all
his
money
.
<EOS>
“Now
<EOS>
then

said
Bill
,
“
come
down

”He
<EOS>
did
not
perceive
the
wink
that
passed
between
his
new
friends
,
butat
once
followed
them
from
the
attic
to
the
lower
part
of
the
crazytenement
.
<EOS>
In
an
old
wainscoted
room
on
the
first
floor
,
there
was
a
bright
andcheerful
-
looking
fire
,
and
such
scanty
articles
of
furniture
as
wereabsolutely
requisite
for
the
personal
accommodation
of

fourpersons
.
<EOS>
A
table
,
on
which
were
several
plates
,
mugs
,
bottles
,
and
otherevidences
of
some
recent
meal
,
stood
close
by
the
fire
.
<EOS>
Bill
,
the
proprietor
of
all
this
display
of
dirt
and
dinginess
,
took
upthe
poker
from
the
fire

side
,
and
beat
it
heavily
against
the
floor

observing
at
the

time—“It

”“You
speak
like

Bill

remarked
the
other
man
,
throwinghimself
into
a
seat
,
and
giving
Jacob
Gray
a
pull
towards
him
to
undothe
rope
that
was
still
round
his
middle
.
<EOS>
“What
will

drink

<EOS>
cried
Bill
<EOS>
;
“
I

cried
the

“I

Gray

“

”The
door
now
opened

and
an
old
wrinkled
hag
appeared
,
who
,
in
not
verycourteous
terms
,
demanded,—“What

said
Bill

“Nothing

He
preferswine
,
because
it
should
n’t
get
in
his
head
.
<EOS>
Do
you
hear?”The
old
woman
fixed
her
keen
,
twinkling
eye
upon
Gray
,
and
then
,
with
achuckle
which
quickly
turned
to
a
cough
,
she
left
the
room
on
hererrand
.
<EOS>
“We’ll
settle
all
business
after
supper
,
”
remarked
Gray
’s
entertainer
.
<EOS>
“Then
<EOS>
I
should
advise
you
to
lay
by
very
snug
for
some
days
.
<EOS>
You
can’tstay
here
,
though
.
<EOS>
”“No
<EOS>
—
no
,
”
said
Gray
,
who
had
quite
as
much
objection
to
remaining
thereas
the
thieves
had
to
permitting
him
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
“
I
will
find
some
placeof
refuge
without
doubt
.
<EOS>
”“Do
<EOS>
you
know
the
man
whose
head
you
so
handsomely
settled
in
the
court?”“No
,
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
It
was
in
self
-
defence
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
taken
me
.
<EOS>
”“Self
-
defence
be
d
—
d
,
”
remarked
Gray
’s
first
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
“
He
’s
a
goodriddance
:
his
name
was
Vaughan
,
and
a
pest
he
was
to
all
the
family
inLondon
.
<EOS>
”“Tell
<EOS>
us
<EOS>
what
lay
you
had
been
on
,
”
said
Bill
,
“
that
made
the
runnersso
hot
after
you?”“Oh
,
only
a
—
a
robbery
—
a
little
robbery
,
”
said
Gray
,
with
a
sicklyattempt
at
a
smile
.
<EOS>
“Oh
,
that
was
all?”“Yes
;
a
robbery
of
two
hundred
pounds
,
of
which
you
are
to
have
one
,
you
know
,
and
to
leave
me
the
other
.
<EOS>
”“That
<EOS>
’s
quite
agreed
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
door
was
now
again
opened
,
and
the
old
woman
appeared
with
a
traycontaining
sundry
viands
from
neighbouring
shops
dealing
inready
-
cooked
victuals
.
<EOS>
Wine
and
brandy
likewise
formed
a
part
of
herburthen
,
and
in
a
very
few
moments
the
table
was
spread
,
and
Gray
,
whoreally
,
now
that
he
felt
himself
comparatively
safe
,
began
to
betormented
by
the
pangs
of
hunger
,
fell
to
with
a
vigorous
appetite
,
upon
a
cold
tongue
of
ample
dimensions
.
<EOS>
“How
<EOS>
do
you
like
it
?
”
<EOS>
said
Bill
,
with
a
wink
to
his
comrade
.
<EOS>
“’Tis
<EOS>
excellent
,
”
replied
Gray
,
glancing
towards
the
bottles
.
<EOS>
“You
will
take
wine
<EOS>
now?”“If
<EOS>
you
please
.
<EOS>
”A
<EOS>
bottle
was
uncorked
,
and
Gray
relished
the
wine
very
much
,
along
withthe
other
items
of
his
repast
.
<EOS>
The
confederates
drank
small
quantities
of
brandy
from
another
bottle
,
and
encouraged
Gray
by
never
allowing
his
glass
to
be
empty
to
makegreat
progress
with
the
wine
.
<EOS>
Glass
after
glass
he
drank
with
a
kind
of
recklessness
foreign
to
hisnature
,
but
the
liquor
was
drugged
,
and
the
very
first
draught
had
madea
confusion
in
the
intellect
of
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
Up
to
his
brain
the
fumesmounted
,
awakening
a
desire
still
for
more
,
and
lighting
up
his
eyeswith
a
strange
wild
fire
.
<EOS>
His
two
companions
now
nodded
and
winked
at
each
other
openly
,
<EOS>
forJacob
Gray
was
too
far
gone
in
intoxication
to
heed
them
.
<EOS>
“He’ll
do
,
”
remarked
Bill
in
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
“Of
course
,
”
said
the
other
,
“
you
may
depend
he
has
something
worthwhile
about
him
.
<EOS>
”“No
<EOS>
doubt
—
no

”“Gentlemen

”
said
Gray
,
pouring
himself
out
another
<EOS>
glass,“here
’s
<EOS>

”“Hurrah

cried
Bill
,
“
that
’s

<EOS>
”“And

confusion

added
Gray
,
dealing
the
table
aheavy
blow
with
his
fist
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
It

been

<EOS>
The

”“Oh

it

cried
Bill
.
<EOS>
“She

muttered
Gray
“

”“Here
’s
a
beauty

remarked
Bill
,
to
his
comrade
,
who
had
very
calmlylighted
a
fire
,
and
sat
listening
to
Gray
’s
revelations
with
all
thecomposure
in
the
world
,
as
if
he
had
merely
been
present
at
someordinary
dramatic
entertainment
.
<EOS>
“Three
thousand
pounds
would
be
enough
,
”
said
Gray
,
tossing
off
anotherbumper
of
the
drugged
wine
,
and
smashing
the
glass
with
the
vehemencewith
which
he
replaced
it
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
“
Three

<EOS>

Then
I

the

without
taking
the

from

<EOS>
“Don’t

suddenly

to

CHAPTER
LVII.Ada
’s
Escape.—The
<EOS>
Magistrate.—Ada
’s
Ignorance
of
LondonLocalities.—Learmont
’s
Fright
.
<EOS>
When
Ada
sunk
insensible
into
the
arms
of
a
stranger
,
after
denouncingJacob
Gray
as
a
murderer
,
she
was
conveyed
into
a
shop
byCharing
-
cross
,
when
her
rare
and
singular
beauty
,
and
the
peculiarcircumstances
under
which
she
had
fainted
,
were
the
themes
of
everytongue
.
<EOS>
Such
restoratives
as
upon
the
moment
could
be
procured
wereimmediately
brought
into
requisition
,
and
after
a
quarter
of
an
hourshe
gently
opened
her
eyes
with
a
faint
sigh
and
looked
inquiringlyabout
her
.
<EOS>
Then
she
clasped
her
hands
,
and
as
she
gazed
upon
the
throng
ofcurious
,
yet
compassionate
faces
that
surrounded
her
,
she
exclaimed,—“What
has
happened
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
speak
to
me
;
where
am
I?”“You
have
fainted
,
”
cried
four
or
five
voices
in
a
breath
.
<EOS>
“Fainted
<EOS>
—
fainted?”“Yes
;
I
brought
you
in
after
you
had
called
after
the
man
as
amurderer
,
”
said
the
person
who
had
caught
Ada
before
she
was
broughtinto
the
shop
.
<EOS>
For
the
space
of
about
another
minute
then
the
young
girl
lookedconfused
;
after
that
a
gush
of
recollections
flashed
across
her
mind
,
and
the
feeling
that
she
was
really
at
last
free
from
Jacob
Gray
,
cameacross
her
heart
with
so
much
happiness
and
joy
,
that
covering
herbeautiful
face
with
her
small
slender
hands
,
she
burst
into
tears
andsobbed
aloud
in
her
fulness
of
heart
.
<EOS>
Those
who
stood
by
seemed
to
feel
that
there
was
something
sacred
inthe
tears
of
the
young
thing
before
them
,
for
they
stood
silent
,
and
noone
attempted
to
insult
her
by
the
usual
commonplace
remarks
of
vulgarconsolation
.
<EOS>
There
were
tears
in
almost
every
eye
,
and
when
Adawithdrew
her
hands
from
her
face
,
and
a
smile
,
beautiful
as
a
sunbeamafter
an
April
shower
,
illumined
her
expressive
countenance
,
it
seemedas
if
some
universal
joy
had
been
awakened
in
every
breast
,
andmurmured
blessings
upon
her
beauty
,
burst
from
several
of
the
personswho
had
crowded
,
from
motives
of
curiosity
,
into
the
shop
.
<EOS>
Then
Ada
looked
from
face
to
face
,
and
oh
,
how
different
were
thosehonest
sympathising
countenances
to
the
dark
ever
shifting
expressionof
the
lineaments
of
Jacob
Gray
,
where
avarice
,
cruelty
,
and
fear
wereever
struggling
together
for
a
mastery
.
<EOS>
“Thank
you
all
—
thank
you
all
,
”
she
cried
;
“
I
am
very
happy
now
.
<EOS>
”This
was
not
a
very
comprehensible
speech
to
those
who
had
not
gonethrough
the
scene
of
misery
and
woe
,
that
the
young
heart
of
Ada
hadknown
,
but
still
there
was
a
deep
truthfulness
and
sincerity
in
thetone
in
which
it
was
uttered
that
sensibly
affected
every
one
.
<EOS>
“Shall
<EOS>
I
take
you
home
?
”
<EOS>
said
the
person
who
had
supported
her
in
thestreet
.
<EOS>
“Home
—
home
?
”
<EOS>
cried
Ada
.
<EOS>
“Yes
<EOS>
;
you
are
not
well
enough
to
go
home
by
yourself
;
I
will
see
yousafely
home
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
have
no
home
,
”
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“No
<EOS>
home?”“None
<EOS>
—
I
never
had
a
home
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
people
looked
at
each
other
in
amazement
,
and
several
of
themsignificantly
touched
their
foreheads
in
confirmation
of
their
beliefthat
the
beautiful
young
girl
was
not
quite
right
in
her
head
.
<EOS>
“Where
are
your
friends
?
”
said
one
.
<EOS>
“Alas
<EOS>
,
I
know
not
,
”
cried
Ada
,
mournfully
.
<EOS>
“
Tell
me
,
is
he
whom
Idenounced
in
the
street
taken
prisoner?”“No
,
not
that
I
am
aware
of
,
”
said
a
man
.
<EOS>
“
There
has
been
one
here
<EOS>
whosays
he
ran
up
the
Strand
like
a
madman
and
escaped
.
<EOS>
”Ada
<EOS>
shuddered
as
she
said,—“Let
<EOS>
him
go
now
;
his
own
conscience
must
be
punishment
enough
.
<EOS>
Let
himgo
now
.
<EOS>
”“What
<EOS>
has
he
done
?
”
<EOS>
said
several
voices
at
once
.
<EOS>
“Murder
,
”
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“
My
eyes
were
shocked
with
the
sight
of
blood
.
<EOS>
Heis
a
murderer
.
<EOS>
”“A
murderer?”“Yes
<EOS>
—
I
saw
him
do
the
deed
.
<EOS>
”“What
<EOS>
’s
<EOS>
his
name?”“Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
people
glanced
at
each
other
,
and
then
several
left
the
shop
,
considering
Jacob
Gray
as
the
more
interesting
person
of
the
two
tomake
inquiries
about
.
<EOS>
“Where
<EOS>
will
you
go
,
my
dear
?
”
<EOS>
said
the
owner
of
the
shop
.
<EOS>
“I
have
but
one
friend
,
”
said
Ada
,
“
to
whom
there
is
any
hope
ofsending
.
<EOS>
He
has
called
himself
my
friend
,
and
his
voice
was
sincere
.
<EOS>
Iwill
believe
that
he
sought
me
with
kindly
feelings
.
<EOS>
His
name
isHartleton
—
he
is
a
magistrate
.
<EOS>
”“Sir
Francis
Hartleton?”“Yes
—
the
same
.
<EOS>
”“If
<EOS>
he
knows
you
and
is
your
friend
,
”
said
one
,
“
you
need
look
nofarther
,
for
he
is
a
good
man
,
and
universally
esteemed
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
thank
you
for
those
words
,
”
cried
Ada
.
<EOS>
“
And
—
and
tell
me
—
do
<EOS>
any
ofyou
know
Albert
Seyton?”All
shook
their
heads
,
and
one
man
remarked,—“That
<EOS>
he
knew
an
AlbertBrown
,
which
was
the
nearest
he
could
come
to
it
.
<EOS>
”“I
will
take
you
to
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
’s
,
”
said
the
man
of
the
shop
.
<EOS>
Before
Ada
could
reply
,
the
door
was
opened
,
and
a
stranger
walked
in
,
saying,—“Where
<EOS>
is
the
girl?”“Here
,
here
?
”
<EOS>
cried
many
voices
.
<EOS>
The
stranger
stepped
forward
,
and
upon
seeing
Ada
,
he
said,—“My
lass
,
you
must
come
with
me
before
a
magistrate
,
and
tell
us
whatyou
know
of
this
man
who
has
led
us
such
a
pretty
race
up
the
Strand
.
”“Is
<EOS>
he
caught
?
”
<EOS>
cried
several
.
<EOS>
“No
<EOS>
,
”
replied
the
officer
,
for
such
he
was
;
“
we
nearly
had
him
by
thecourt
next
to
Somerset
-
house
,
but
he
killed
the
man
who
laid
hold
ofhim
.
”“Another
<EOS>
murder
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Ada
.
<EOS>
“Yes
<EOS>
;
I
never
saw
such
a
sight
as
he
left
the
man
.
<EOS>
”“Take
<EOS>
me
to
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
”
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“That
<EOS>
I
will
,
”
said
the
officer
.
<EOS>
Ada
sprung
to
her
feet
,
and
then
,
turning
to
those
in
the
shop
,
shesaid,—“Accept
my
heartfelt
thanks
?
<EOS>
I
am
poor
in
all
else
.
<EOS>
”Then
,
taking
the
offered
arm
of
the
officer
,
who
,
though
rough
anduncouth
,
meant
to
be
quite
kind
and
considerate
in
his
way
,
she
leftthe
shop
,
and
the
strangely
-
matched
pair
proceeded
down
Whitehalltowards
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
’s
house
.
<EOS>
“That
fellow
as
you
was
with
my

remarked
the
officer
,
“

and

down
as
fifteen
hammers

and
a

<EOS>
”This
<EOS>
speech
was
about
as
intelligible
to
Ada
as
if
it
had
been
spokenin
Chinese
,
and
she
replied
mildly,—“I
<EOS>
do
n’t
know
what
you
mean
.
”“Bless
<EOS>
your
innocence
!
”
said
the
officer
;
“
I
means
as
he
’s
the
mostdowniest
cove
as
we
’ve
come
across
lately
.
”“Indeed
,
”
said
Ada
,
who
was
quite
as
wise
as
before
.
<EOS>
“Yes
;
he
went
up
the
Strand
like
twenty
blessed
lamplighters
rolledinto
one
.
”“Where
<EOS>
’s
the
Strand
?
”
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
The
officer
stopped
short
at
the
question
,
and
looked
hard
at
Ada
forsome
moments
to
assure
himself
that
he
was
not
,
in
his
own
phraseology
,
being
“
regularly
done
;
”
but
there
was
something
so
very
innocent
andguileless
in
the
face
of
Ada
that
he
very
reluctantly
came
to
theconclusion
that
she
really
did
not
know
where
the
Strand
was
,
and
fromthat
moment
he
looked
upon
her
as
a
natural
phenomenon
,
and
spoke
toher
with
a
curious
kind
of
considerate
voice
,
such
as
he
would
haveaddressed
to
a
person
not
quite
right
in
her
mind
.
<EOS>
“Why
<EOS>
,
the
Strand
,
”
he
said
,
“
runs
from
the
Cross
to
the
Bar
,
you
see
.
<EOS>
”“Does
it
?
”
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“This
here
is
Whitehall
.
”“Whitehall
?
<EOS>
I
have
read
of
Whitehall
.
<EOS>

statehere
once
.
<EOS>
”“Well
,
I
never

”
thought
the
officer
,
who
had
never
heard
of
CardinalWolsey
in
his
life
.
<EOS>
“
She
’s
wandering
in
her
mind
,
poor
thing
.
<EOS>
”“What
<EOS>
building
is
that
?
”
<EOS>
inquired
Ada
,
as
they
came
opposite
to
theHorse
Guards
.
<EOS>
“That
’
ere
is
the
Horse
Guards
,
and
leads
into
the
Park

<EOS>
”“St

<EOS>
James

<EOS>
I
have

said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“
That
too
is
full
ofrecollection

<EOS>
”“I
believe

said
the
officer
.
<EOS>
“
Do

said
Ada
,
who
,
if
there
had
been
a

had
never

<EOS>
The
ladies
used
to
take
a
drive
out
of

onpurpose
to
be
robbed
by
Claude
Duval
.
<EOS>
”“A
<EOS>
strange
fancy
,
”
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
They
now
proceeded
for
some
distance
in
silence
,
until
they
came
to
alarge
mansion
,
every
window
of
which
was
blazing
with
light
,
and
fromthe
interior
of
which
came
the
sound
of
music
.
<EOS>
Ada
paused
,
and
looked
upon
the
illuminated
windows
as
a
sensation
ofpleasure
came
across
her
mind
,
arising
from
the
sweet
sounds
of
melodythat
<EOS>
came
wafted
to
her
ears
from
within
the
house
of
revelry
.
<EOS>
“Ah
<EOS>
!
”
remarked
the
officer
,
looking
up
at
the
house
,
“
they
do
keep
itup
finely
.
<EOS>
Almost
every
night
now
for
a
week
there
has
been
nothing
butfeasting
,
dancing
,
and
music
in
that
house
.
<EOS>
They
say
its
master
don’tlike
to
be
left
alone
,
and
that
he
is
never
satisfied
unless
the
housebe
full
of
company
,
and
himself
in
the
very
midst
of
it
.
<EOS>
”“Indeed!”“Yes
,
he
is
an
odd
-
looking
fellow
;
but
they
say
he
is
so
rich
he
mightpave
his
great
hall
with
guineas
.
<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
yet
shrinks
,
as
it
were
,
from
himself
,
that
he
dare
not
be
alone!”“Why
,
’
atween
<EOS>
you
and
I
,
there
’s
Tyburn
written
upon
his
face
.
<EOS>
”“What
upon
his
face?”“Tyburn
.
<EOS>
”“What
<EOS>
’s
that?”“Why
—
why
—
you
do
n’t
mean
all
to
go
to
say
as
you
never
heard
o

<EOS>
Tyburn?”“I
have
lived
a
lone
and
solitary
life
,
”
said
Ada
;
“
and
,
although
sonear
the
haunts
of
thousands
of
my
fellow
-
creatures
,
I
have
seen

<EOS>
The

in
this
great
city
,
the
habits
,
the
thoughts
,
and
actions
of
its
myriads
of

allstrange

For

I

<EOS>
”There
was
a
mournful
pathos
in
the
tone
of
voice
in
which
Ada
utteredthese
words
that
gave
them
their
full
effect
upon
the
rough
man
she
waswith
.
<EOS>
Nature
spoke
in
every
soft
melancholy
word
that
fell
from
herlips
;
and
,
although
her
language
was
to
him
as
strange
andincomprehensible
quite
,
as
his
to
her
,
he
understood
sufficient
toreply
to
her.—“Then
,
whosoever
shut
you
up
,
and
purvented
you
from
going
about
andamusing
yourself
,
my

was
a
big
brute
,
and
only
let
him
comeacross
me
,
<EOS>
that
’s
all
.
”“Whose
<EOS>
house
is
this
?
”
<EOS>
said
Ada
,
listening
,
at
the
same
time
,
to
abeautiful
melody
which
was
being
played
as
a
prelude
to
thecommencement
of
a
dance
.
<EOS>
“Squire
<EOS>
Learmont
they
call
him
,
”
replied
the
man
;
“
but
,
if
he
lives
alittle
-
longer
,
it
’s
said
he
’ll
be
a
lord
,
or
something
of
that
kind
.
<EOS>
”Ada
<EOS>
placed
her
hand
upon
her
brow
,
and
repeated
the
name
of
Learmont
,
as
if
its
sound
conjured
up
some
long
-
forgotten
images
in
her
brain
.
<EOS>
Then
she
shook
her
head
,
as
memory
could
shape
to
her
nothing
<EOS>
tangiblein
connexion
with
the
name
,
which
yet
,
as
she
again
pronounced
it
,
cameupon
her
heart
as
something
far
from
new
.
<EOS>
“Learmont
<EOS>
—
Learmont
!
”
<EOS>
she
murmured
,
as
if
pleased
with
the
repetition
.
<EOS>
“Yes
,
that
’s
his
name
,
”
rejoined
the
officer
.
<EOS>
“
Nobody
knows
exactlywhere
he
got
all
his
money
from
;
but
got
it
he
has
,
and
he
knows
how
tospend
it
too
.
<EOS>
”At
<EOS>
this
moment
the
doors
of
the
mansion
were
flung
open
,
and
a
splendidcarriage
dashed
up
to
the
entrance
.
<EOS>
“There
’s
somebody
coming
,
”
remarked
the
officer
to
Ada
.
<EOS>
“
Let
’s
have
alook
at
them
.
<EOS>
”Ada
<EOS>
and
her
companion
now
crossed
the
road
,
and
stood
close
to
the
stepof
Learmont
’s
house
,
as
a
lacquey
shouted
to
those
in
the
hall,—“Lord
and
Lady
Brereton
,
and
the
Honourable
Georgiana
Brereton
.
<EOS>
”A
<EOS>
blaze
of
light
shot
from
the
interior
of
the
mansion
,
and
just
as
theguests
were
alighting
,
Learmont
himself
descended
the
steps
of
hishouse
to
receive
them
.
<EOS>
He
was
attired
in
a
splendid
suit
of
moreen
velvet
,
and
a
diamond
ofgreat
lustre
sparkled
in
his
sword
hilt
.
<EOS>
His
fingers
were
covered
withrings
,
profusely
studded
with
precious
stones
,
and
,
take
his
appearancealtogether
,
he
looked
,
indeed
,
like
the
man
who
could
pave
his
hallwith
gold
.
<EOS>
A
bland
and
courtly
smile
was
upon
his
face
,
and
he
handed
theoccupants
of
the
carriage
up
the
steps
,
with
the
air
of
a
sovereignprince
,
graciously
condescending
to
an
act
of
rare
and
unexampledcourtesy
.
<EOS>
From
the
moment
that
he
had
appeared
,
Ada
had
never
taken
her
eyes
<EOS>
fromoff
his
face
<EOS>
;
she
seemed
like
one
fascinated
by
the
basilisk
eyes
of
aserpent
,
and
,
with
a
wild
rush
of
mingled
feelings
,
which
she
couldneither
define
nor
understand
,
she
watched
each
varying
expression
ofthat
cold
,
pale
,
haughty
countenance
that
wore
upon
its
surface
sohollow
and
so
artificial
a
smile
.
<EOS>
Learmont
was
one
step
below
the
Honourable
Lady
<EOS>
he
was
handing
by
theextreme
tips
of
her
fingers
,
into
his
house
,
when
the
officer
,
in
whathe
thought
a
whisper
,
said
to
Ada,—“That
’s
him
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
guilty
heart
of
Learmont
throbbed
even
at
this
trifling
remark
,
forit
did
reach
his
ears
,
and
he
turned
suddenly
to
see
who
had
utteredit
,
when
his
eyes
met
Ada
’s
,
and
for
the
space
of
about
one
moment
theylooked
full
at
each
other
.
<EOS>
The
look
on
Ada
’s
part
was
one
of
intense
and
indescribable
interestand
curiosity
,
but
on
Learmont
<EOS>
’s
<EOS>
,
it
was
that
concentratedsoul
-
stricken
glare
,
with
which
a
person
might
be
supposed
to
regardfor
about
a
breathing
space
,
some
awful
blasting
spectre
,
<EOS>
ere
naturegathers
strength
to
scream
.
<EOS>
A
wild
unearthly
cry
burst
from
his
lips
,
and
he
stretched
out
hishands
towards
her
as
he
ascended
the
steps
backwards
,
crying
,
or
rathershrieking,—“Off
—
off
—
<EOS>
off—”Then
<EOS>
as
he
reached
the
top
he
reeled
into
the
hall
of
his
house
,
andwas
caught
by
his
servants
as
he
fell
insensible
from

CHAPTER
LVIII.An
<EOS>
Anecdote.—Sir
<EOS>
Francis
Hartleton
’s
House
at
Westminster.—TheReception.—Ada
’s
Conduct
and
Feelings
<EOS>
.
<EOS>
Ada
was
both
astonished
and
alarmed
at
the
sudden
emotion
of
the
manwho
,
her
reason
told
her
,
was
a
stranger
to
her
;
but
who
herimagination
seemed
notwithstanding
to
recognise
as
one
who
she
musthave
seen
before
.
<EOS>
Her
memory
concerning
him
was
like
one
of
thosesudden
strange
feelings
which
occasionally
come
over
us
all
,
as
we
meetparticular
people
who
we
are
quite
sure
we
have
not
met
before
,
but
whonevertheless
wear
not
the
aspect
of
strangers
to
us
;
people
whom
wecould
almost
imagine
we
had
been
intimate
with
for
good
or
evil
,
insome
other
state
of
existence
long
antecedent
to
this
.
<EOS>
On
occasions
of
this
singular
nature
too
,
there
will
always
be
a
dimperception
in
the
mind
concerning
the
person
so
strangely
recognised;which
enables
us
to
say
,
with
certainty
,
whether
the
circumstancesconnected
with
him
or
her
quite
unremembered
,
though
they
maybe
,
wereof
a
pleasing
or
a
disagreeable
character
.
<EOS>
To
Ada
,
the
full
sight
ofLearmont
’s
face
brought
a
sensation
of
shuddering
horror
,
which
assuredher
that
wherever
or
whenever
she
and
he
had
ever
taken
part
togetherin
the
great
drama
of
human
existence
,
he
was
an
enemy
to
be
at
onceloathed
and
dreaded
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
officer
he
was
so
astonished
and
confounded
at
the
wholeaffair
,
that
after
rubbing
his
eyes
twice
,
he
looked
a
long
way
<EOS>
downthe
street
,
with
the
full
expectation
of
seeing
something
coming
whichmight
,
in
some
measure
,
account
for
Learmont
’s
sudden
and
extraordinaryflight
.
<EOS>
That
the
mere
sight
of
the
face
of
the
beautiful
girl
,
who
waswith
him
,
could
cause
such
an
excess
of
terror
,
he
could
not
imagine
,
and
when
a
servant
came
from
the
hall
,
and
said
to
him,—“What
was
it
!
<EOS>
What
scared
him
?
”
<EOS>
he
replied—“I’ll
be
hanged
if
I
know
.
<EOS>
He
was
going
up
the
steps
,
like
Claude
Duvalat
a
minuet
,
when
he
was
taken
aback
by
something
.
”“It
<EOS>
’s
very
odd
,
”
said
the
servant
.
<EOS>
“You
may
say
that
,
”
remarked
the
officer
.
<EOS>
“Come
away
—
come
away
,
”
said
Ada
faintly
,
“
to
Sir
Francis
Hartleton;come
,
come
.
”“Certainly
<EOS>
,
”
said
the
officer
,
“
but
this
here
is
,
out
of
all
hand
,
<EOS>
therummiest
go
ever
<EOS>
I
seed
in
all
my
life
.
<EOS>
”“Come
,
come
,
”
repeated
Ada
,
“
I
would
not
see
that
man
again
for
worlds
.
<EOS>
”“No
<EOS>
wonder
<EOS>
he
’s
frightened
you
.
<EOS>
My
own
very
hair
nearly
stood
a
’
end
.
<EOS>
I’m
afeared
he
’s
done
something
queer
,
and
wants
to
be
found
out
,
<EOS>
that
’s
what
I
am
.
<EOS>
I
supposes
as
he
seed
some
sort
o
’
ghostesses
as
madehim
take
on
so
.
<EOS>
”Ada
<EOS>
sighed
.
<EOS>
“Don’t
<EOS>
you
mind
it
,
”
said
the
officer
.
<EOS>
“
You
may
depend
as
he
’s
a
victimof
conscience
,
he
is
.
<EOS>
I
once
before
seed
a
face
very
like
that
as
hemade
when
he
staggered
up
the
steps
.
<EOS>
”“Indeed?”“Yes
.
<EOS>
As
like
it
as
one
pea
is
like
another
.
”“Where
<EOS>
saw
you
it?”“In
the
condemned
cell
.
<EOS>
”“The
condemned
cell
;
where
,
is
that?”“In
Newgate
.
<EOS>
It
’s
where
we
stow
a
fellow
afore
his
execution
.
<EOS>
There
wasa
man
named
Rankin
,
who
had
committed
a
murder
,
and
he
was
regularlytried
and
condemned
.
<EOS>
Well
,
he
carried
it
off
with
a
high
hand
,
swearingand
blustering
away
,
as
if
he
did
n’t
care
a
bit
,
and
roaring
out
ashe’d
die
game
,
which
I
knew
very
well
<EOS>
he
would
n’t
,
for
the
noisy
onesnever
do
.
<EOS>
”“Well
<EOS>
,
you
see
he
was
put
in
the
cell
,
and
we
promised
to
wake
him
inthe
morning
,
in
answer
to
which
piece
of
politeness
<EOS>
he
swore
away
at
uslike
a
house
o
’
fire
.
<EOS>
”“At
<EOS>
half
-
past
six
,
I
and
another
went
to
get
him
up
,
and
when
we
wentin
,
he
never
said
not
a
word
,
and
I
cried
out
,
‘
hilloa
.
’
<EOS>
Still
he
neverspoke
,
and
I
held
up
his
light
,
and
there
he
was
,
a
standing
straightup
against
the
further
end
of
the
cell
with
his
eyes
half
an
inch
outof
his
head
,
and
some
such
a
face
as
that
Learmont
puts
on
.
<EOS>
”Ada
<EOS>
shuddered
and
the
officer
continued
.
<EOS>
“When
we
went
up
to
him
<EOS>
,
what
do
you
think
we
found?”“I
can
not
tell
.
<EOS>
”“He
<EOS>
was
stone
dead
and
stiffened
up
against
the
wall
of
his
cell
<EOS>
,
andour
chaplain
said
as
how
he
must
have
seen
the
devil
all
of
a
sudden
.
<EOS>
But
here
we
are
at
Sir
Francis
Hartleton’s
.
<EOS>
”Ada
<EOS>
cast
her
eyes
up
to
the
house
,
and
a
pang
shot
across
her
heart
<EOS>
asthe
doubt
crossed
her
mind
,
that
Jacob
Gray
might
by
some
innatepossibility
have
spoken
the
truth
,
when
he
described
Sir
Francis
as
herenemy
;
but
still
she
hesitated
not
,
but
silently
commending
herself
tothe
care
of
Heaven
,
she
entered
the
house
along
with
the
officer
.
<EOS>
She
was
left
for
some
time
in
a
handsomely
-
furnished
parlour
,
for
thiswas
<EOS>
the
magistrate
’s
private
,
not
his
official
residence
.
<EOS>
Each
momentthat
passed
now
appeared
to
Ada
an
age
of
suspense
and
anxiety
.
<EOS>
Shecould
hear
the
beating
of
her
own
heart
in
the
silence
of
that
room
,
and
,
as
she
sat
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
door
,
she
thought
that
shehad
scarcely
suffered
as
much
anxiety
,
even
when
,
in
the
dreary
cellwith
Jacob
Gray
,
a
spirit
of
resistance
to
him
and
all
his
acts
,
supported
her
and
prevented
her
mind
from
sinking
beneath
theoppressive
circumstances
which
then
surrounded
her
.
<EOS>
Ada
’s
mind
was
of
that
rare
and
high
order
which
rises
superior
tocircumstances
,
and
the
energies
of
which
become
more
acute
and
morecapable
of
vigorous
action
,
the
more
necessity
there
exists
for
the
useof
such
qualities
.
<EOS>
Now
,
however
,
when
there
was
no
iniquity
to
denounce
,
no
wickedness
toresist
,
but
when
her
heart
was
only
oppressed
with
a
faint
doubt
ofwhether
she
was
to
receive
from
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
kindness
or
not
,
she
did
feel
faint
,
weak
,
and
sad
,
and
all
those
tremblingsensibilities
of
her
nature
she
had
suppressed
from
native
energy
ofmind
,
and
pride
of
innocence
,
when
with
Gray
,
now
that
she
was
freefrom
him
,
arose
from
the
recesses
of
her
pure
heart
and
forced
her
tofeel
,
that
,
although
a
noble
-
minded
heroine
when
surrounded
by
greatperil
,
yet
in
real
nature
she
was
but
a
timid
shrinking
girl
,
such
asher
fragile
and
<EOS>
beautifully
delicate
appearance
would
indicate
.
<EOS>
Then
when
her
anxiety
had
almost
grown
into
a
positive
pain
,
the
dooropened
and
a
tall
,
gentlemanly
-
looking
man
,
with
an
intelligentcountenance
,
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
Ada
rose
,
but
for
a
moment
she
could
not
speak
.
<EOS>
He
who
had
come
in
,
evidently
saw
her
emotion
,
for
he
said
in
accents
of
the
greatestkindness
and
tender
consideration
to
her,—“Sit
down
,
and
do
n’t
be
alarmed
—
<EOS>
I
will
listen
to
you
with
patience
.
<EOS>
”It
was
not
the
words
,
but
it
was
the
tone
of
genuine
heartfelt
kindnessin
which
they
were
spoken
,
that
went
direct
to
the
heart
of
Ada
.
<EOS>
Once
,
twice
,
she
tried
to
speak
,
but
what
all
the
threats
,
and
all
theharshness
of
Jacob
Gray
had
failed
to
produce
,
these
few
simple
wordskindly
spoken
,
at
once
accomplished
,
and
she
burst
into
tears
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
had
merely
been
told
that
a
young
girl
wished
tosee
him
,
and
he
had
not
the
remotest
idea
of
who
she
was
,
or
upon
whaterrand
she
came
.
<EOS>
“I
pray
you
to
be
calm
,
”
he
said
,
“
I
have
no
doubt
you
have
<EOS>
somethingto
tell
me
that
afflicts
you
very
much
.
<EOS>
”“No
<EOS>
,
no
,
”
cried
Ada
.
<EOS>
“No!”“It
is
joy
—
the
joy
of
meeting
a
kind
heart
,
that
forces
these
tearsfrom
me
—
I
am
,
sir
,
but
too
—
too
happy
now
.
<EOS>
”“God
forbid
<EOS>
I
should
speak
otherwise
than
kindly
to
you
.
”“Oh
<EOS>
,
sir
,
”
said
Ada
,
dashing
aside
the
long
clustering
ringlets
of
herhair
,
that
in
her
deep
emotion
had
veiled
her
face
.
<EOS>
“
You
do
not
knowme
,
but
I
have
pondered
over
your
name
till
hopes
and
fears
of
who
orwhat
you
were
have
made
my
heart
sicken
.
<EOS>
Though
young
in
years
,
itseems
to
me
that
in
the
small
space
of
time
which
has
seen

I
have
lived
an
age
of

of

<EOS>
Iam

Debarred

Francis
Hartleton
during
this
speech
had
stood
before
Ada
with
oneof
her
hands
clasped
in
his
,
and
showing
by
his
earnest
attention
,
andthe
deep
sympathy
depicted
in
his
countenance
,
that
he
was
far
from
anunmoved
listener
to
her
words
.
<EOS>
When
she
had
concluded
,
a
fervent
“
thankHeaven
!
”
<EOS>
burst
from
his
lips
,
and
he
cried
with
animation.—“Ada
,
<EOS>
I
have
for
many
months
now
sought
you
throughout
this
greatcity
—
not
one
day
has
elapsed
without
some
effort
upon
my
part
to
findyou
,
and
offer
you
friendship
,
protection
,
and
a
home
;
my
poor
girl
<EOS>
,
you
have
suffered
much
—
I
know
it
—
have
known
it
long
,
and
it
has
been
ashadow
on
my
heart
,
to
think
that
I
could
not
aid
you;—your
trials
—
yourpersecutions
are
all
over
now
,
and
once
more
I
from
my
heart
thankHeaven
that
I
see
you
under
my
protection
,
safe
from
that
awful
man
,
who
I
ever
dreaded
would
in
some
wild
moment
,
sacrifice
you
to
hisfears
,
or
to
his
revenge
.
<EOS>
Ada
,
you
are
safe
and
free
!
<EOS>
I
have
both
powerand
will
to
shelter
you
,
and
while
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
lives
,
whoeverwould
harm
you
must
do
it
through
his
heart
.
<EOS>
”When
<EOS>
first
Sir
Francis
had
commenced
speaking
,
Ada
had
fixed
her
largepensive
eyes
upon
his
face
,
and
appeared
to
drink
in
with
her
soulevery
word
he
uttered
;
but
as
he
went
on
,
and
his
own
voice
became
alittle
broken
by
the
depth
of
his
emotion
and
the
sincerity
of
hissympathy
,
she
,
in
all
the
guileless
innocence
of
her
heart
,
pressed
hishand
within
hers
,
and
tears
gushed
from
her
eyes
;
but
when
he
told
herthat
she
was
now
safe
for
ever
from
Jacob
Gray
,
and
that
his
homeshould
be
hers
,
her
joy
and
gratitude
became
too
much
for
her
,
and
shelaid
her
head
upon
his
breast
and
wept
,
as
she
would
have
done
upon
herfather
’s
heart
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
was
himself
scarcely
less
affected
than
Ada
,
forbrave
,
noble
,
and
gifted
natures
such
as
his
,
are
easily
melted
by
thesofter
feelings
of
human
nature
.
<EOS>
When
he
spoke
,
which
was
not
for
some
minutes
,
for
he
could
scarcelycommand
his
voice
sufficiently
,
he
said,—“Ada
,
you
shall
rest
till
to
-
morrow
before
you
tell
me
all
yourhistory
<EOS>
—
I
have
likewise
much
to
tell
you
,
and
to
-
morrow
we
will
have
along
conference
.
<EOS>
”“Yes
,
”
said
Ada
,
“
<EOS>
oh
,
what
can
I
say
to
you
to
make
you
know
<EOS>
how
myheart
thanks
you?”“Nothing
—
say
nothing
,
Ada
—
Heaven
will
help
me
to
do
what
I
am
nowdoing
—
it
is
but
my
duty
,
Ada
,
to
protect
you
.
<EOS>
Remember
now
you
are
athome
—
you
are
no
guest
here
,
mind
,
but
one
of
ourselves
.
<EOS>
These
,
I
hope
,
are
the
last
tears
I
shall
ever
see
you
shed
.
”“Ah
<EOS>
,
sir
,
they
are
far
different
from
those
I
have
shed
in
the
silenceand
solitude
of
my
various
prisons
.
<EOS>
Those
were
wrung
from
me
bydespair
.
<EOS>
These
come
from
a
heart
too
full
of
gratitude
.
<EOS>
”Sir
<EOS>
Francis
Hartleton
now
rung
a
small
hand
bell
,
which
was
immediatelyanswered
by
a
servant
,
to
whom
he
said,—“Tell
your
mistress
to
come
to
me
here
;
”
then
turning
to
Ada
,
he
said
,
with
a
half
-
smile
upon
his
face—“Now
,
my
dear
Ada
,
I
shall
have
nothingto
do
with
you
till
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
I
am
but
recently
married
,
and
my
wifewill
love
you
for
your
own
sake
as
well
as
for
mine
.
<EOS>
She
knows
what
ofyour
history
I
know
,
and
is
well
prepared
to
give
you
welcome
.
<EOS>
”At
<EOS>
this
moment
a
lady
entered
the
room
,
and
Ada
cast
her
eyes
upon
herface
.
<EOS>
That
one
glance
was
sufficient
to
assure
her
she
had
found
afriend
,
for
it
was
one
of
those
faces
that
can
not
conceal
the
goodnessof
the
owner
’s
heart
.
<EOS>
“Emilia
,
this
is
Ada
,
”
said
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
.
<EOS>
“
I
will
not
say
makemuch
of
her
,
and
I
do
n’t
think
you
can
spoil
her

careless

withdrawing

taking

down

in
his

chair
,
andleaving
the
business
to
be
settled

<EOS>
atween
such
as
us
and

<EOS>
It
’
an
iniquity
,
and
no
good
can
come
of
it
.
<EOS>
”“Very
<EOS>
true
,
”
said
Bill
.
<EOS>
“
You
hide
the
money
somewheres
,
while
I
go
andget
the
cart

for
we
must
start
this
chap
somewhere
afore
daylight
.
<EOS>
”“Bill
,
”
said
the
other
,
“
you
would
n’t
like
to
cut
his
throat?”“Not
exactly
.
<EOS>
”“Well
<EOS>
,
<EOS>
well
.
<EOS>
I
only
mention
it
.
<EOS>
I
’m
afraid
he
’s
a
sneak
,
but
let
him
dohis
worst
.
<EOS>
Get
the
chaise
-
cart
,
and
bring
it
round
to
the
corner
by
JemMedbourn’s
.
<EOS>
”Bill
<EOS>
nodded
,
and
went
to
execute
his
errand
,
and
during
his
absence
,
the
other
carefully
concealed
the
money
beneath
the
floor
of
the
room
,
excepting
about
two
hundred
pounds
,
which
he
reserved
for
himself
andcompanion
.
<EOS>
Then
lighting
his
pipe
,
he
again
sat
down
very
composedly
bythe
fire
-
side
.
<EOS>
“Well
<EOS>
,
well
,
”
he
said
suddenly
,
as
if
he
had
arrived
at
some
mentalconclusion
that
he
could
not
help
,
and
yet
did
not
like
.
<EOS>
“
Bill
may
haveit
his
own
way
,
but
I
would
never
have
let
that
chap
,
”
nodding
at
Gray,“have
a
chance
<EOS>
o
’
being
venomous
.
<EOS>
He
’s
cut
out
for
a
sneaking
lump
o’evidence
against
others
he
is
,
and
I
should
n’t
a
bit
wonder
if
he
getsinto
trouble
himself
,
but
he
speaks
agin
us
about
the
money
just
out
o’a
nasty
bit
o
’
revenge
.
”He
<EOS>
then
resumed
his
smoking
as
if
he
had
been
reasoning
upon
some
verycommon
place
affair
indeed
,
and
in
about
ten
minutes
more
Bill
made
hisappearance
,
saying,—“It
’s
all
right
—
they
have
guved
up
the
search
for
to
-
night
,
and
weshall
get
on
famously
.
”“Where
<EOS>
do
you
mean
to
take
him
?
”
<EOS>
said
he
,
who
had
suggested
the
notionof
cutting
Gray
’s
throat
.
<EOS>
“I
should
say
somewhere
a
little
way
out
of
town
,
and
shoot
him
out
o’the
cart
into
some
blessed
verdant
spot
,
”
replied
Bill
.
<EOS>
“
He
’s
rather
aqueer
one
,
himself
,
so
he
’ll
find
as
he
’s
all
right
,
when
he
wakes
upand
finds
as
he
’s
amusing
the
butterflies
and
daisies
.
<EOS>
”“I’m
<EOS>
blessed
if
you
ai
n’t
a
out
and
out
good
un
,
”
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
“Supposes
<EOS>
then
,
”
suggested
Bill
,
“
we
takes
him
up
to
Hampstead
.
<EOS>
It
’s
anodd
little
out
<EOS>
o
’
<EOS>
the
way
place
enough
.
<EOS>
”“Very
<EOS>
good
,
”
said
the
other
.
<EOS>
“
You
are
quite
sure
there
’s
nobody
about?”“Quite
.
<EOS>
”“Come
<EOS>
along
,
then
.
<EOS>
”As
<EOS>
he
spoke
the
man
stooped
,
and
lifted
Jacob
Gray
from
the
ground
withas
much
ease
as
if
he
had
been
an
infant
,
and
followed
his
comrade
downstairs
with
his
burthen
,
which
seemed
in
no
way
to
distress
him
.
<EOS>
The
court
they
passed
out
into
was
one
of
those
kind
which
now
areexceedingly
rare
in
London
,
but
which
the
wisdom
of
our
ancestors
tookgood
care
to
make
very
common
and
infest
the
town
with
.
<EOS>
At
the
periodof
our
tale
there
was
an
immense
wen
,
as
it
might
be
termed
,
of
variouspestiferous
courts
at
the
back
of
the
Strand
,
where
thieves
andvagabonds
of
all
kinds
lived
in
a
sort
of
community
of
their
own
,
quiteundisturbed
by
the
authorities
,
who
then
could
boast
of
very
littleauthority
indeed
.
<EOS>
Another
mass
of
such
courts
was
to
be
found
whereRegent
-
street
now
stands
,
and
the
vicinity
;
another
at
the
bottom
<EOS>
ofSt
.
<EOS>
Martin’s
-
lane
,
and
another
close
to
old
Fleet
-
market
,
so
that
thecity
of
London
was
as
well
provided
with
haunts
of
blackguardism
andvice
as
the
mouth
of
the
Thames
is
with
mud
banks
.
<EOS>
Along
the
narrow
court
in
which
was
Bill
’s
mansion
,
the
confederatespursued
their
way
until
they
came
to
what
any
stranger
would
havesupposed
a
mere
doorway
,
but
which
was
in
reality
an
entrance
toanother
court
;
into
this
they
dived
,
and
after
proceeding
for
a
smalldistance
ascended
a
flight
of
wooden
steps
,
at
the
bottom
of
whichstood
a
dirty
,
mean
chaise
-
cart
.
<EOS>
Into
this
vehicle
,
without
the
least
ceremony
or
consideration
for
whatbruises
he
might
receive
,
Jacob
Gray
was
flung
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
atthe
bottom
of
the
cart
but
some
littered
straw
,
upon
which
he
laid
morelike
a
dead
body
than
anything
living
and
breathing
.
<EOS>
The
two
men
then
climbed
into
the
frail
and
crazy
vehicle
,
and
Billtaking
the
reins
gave
a
shrill
whistle
,
which
the
horse
seemedperfectly
to
understand
as
a
signal
to
go
on
,
for
he
startedimmediately
at
a
smart
trot
.
<EOS>
There
were
no
policemen
then
promenading
the
streets
,
who
might
havelooked
with
an
eye
of
suspicion
upon
the
proceedings
of
Bill
and
hiscomrade
,
and
the
lazy
watchmen
having
just
signally
exerted
themselvesby
squalling
out
the
hour
,
with
the
supplementary
information
that
itwas
a
cold
night
,
betook
themselves
again
to
their
watchboxes
,
leavingthe
community
over
whose
lives
and
property
they
were
supposed
,
by
afiction
which
lasted
many
years
,
to
watch
,
to
the
care
of
Providenceand
the
mercy
of
thieves
and
housebreakers
.
<EOS>
The
chaise
-
cart
rattled
and
bounded
along
through
divers
very
intricatelanes
and
bye
-
streets
,
until
at
length
it
emerged
into
the
Strand
,
nearArundel
-
street
.
<EOS>
Then
dashing
across
the
wide
thoroughfare
,
it
entered
acongeries
of
dirty
streets
on
the
other
side
,
and
finally
emerged
in
acurious
and
complicated
place
close
to
the
British
Museum
.
<EOS>
There
werebye
-
roads
across
the
Pancras
-
fields
,
and
Bill
having
dismounted
andtaken
down
a
bar
which
impeded
his
progress
,
drove
across
a
meadowwhich
now
forms
part
of
the
ground
occupied
by
that
compound
of
pride
,
bloated
arrogance
,
and
humbug
,
the
London
University
.
<EOS>
Another
quarterof
an
hour
passed
,
and
they
were
rattling
up
the
Hampstead
-
road
,
whichthen
had
tall
tress
on
either
side
of
it
.
<EOS>
Camden
Town
was
then
a
small
village
,
with
not
above
forty
littlewhitewashed
houses
in
it
,
with
here
<EOS>
and
there
sprinkled
a
few
edificesof
somewhat
more
pretensions
,
which
had
been
built
by
well
-
to
-
docitizens
,
who
repaired
there
on
a
Sunday
to
see
the
phenomena
of
acabbage
growing
,
and
admire
the
sweet
pea
blossom
as
it
thrust
itspretty
leaves
in
at
the
windows
.
<EOS>
The
most
famous
house
of
entertainment
then
in
Camden
Town
,
was
calledthe
<EOS>
Queen
’s
Head
,
and
has
long
been
levelled
with
the
dust
<EOS>
;
it
was
theneven
an
old
-
fashioned
house
,
and
spoken
of
as
a
curiosity
.
<EOS>
It
couldboast
of
but
one
story
,
and
its
projecting
sign
hung
so
low
that
anyone
riding
by
quickly
,
and
not
aware
of
it
,
ran
the
risk
of
breakinghis
own
head
against
the
queen
’s
,
with
no
very
agreeable
momentum
.
<EOS>
The
entrance
was
adorned
with
oaken
carved
pillars
,
to
the
designs
onwhich
<EOS>
a
great
deal
had
been
added
from
time
to
time
by
bread
and
cheeseknives
,
rapiers
’
penknives
,
and
all
sorts
of
cutting
instruments
,
thedoor
posts
of
an
inn
being
considered
as
much
public
property
,
and
opento
defacement
,
as
are
wooden
seats
in
Kensington
gardens
.
<EOS>
To
enter
the
house
,
you
had
to
descend
two
steps
,
which
generally
atnight
caused
a
strange
visitor
to
fall
on
his
nose
in
the
passage
,
whenthe
hostess
would
come
out
,
hearing
the
clatter
,
and
probably
a
fewoaths
,
and
trim
a
lamp
;
so
that
after
the
mischief
was
done
,
you
hadthe
pleasure
of
seeing
the
steps
quite
clearly
and
beautifully
.
<EOS>
At
this
house
Bill
drew
up
,
and
without
getting
out
,
calledlustily,—“Mother
Meadows
!
<EOS>
Mother
Meadows!”“Well
,
what
now
?
”
said
a
shrill
female
voice
from
the
interior
.
<EOS>
“A
shilling
’s
worth
of
brandy
,
”
said
Bill
,
and
the
coin
he
threwrattled
down
the
steps
.
<EOS>
The
liquor
was
brought
to
the
chaise
-
cart
by
a
boy
,
with
a
head
of
hairresembling
strongly
one
of
the
now
popular
patent
chimney
sweepingapparatus
.
<EOS>
Bill
took
his
half
to
a
nicety
,
and
handed
the
remainder
to
hiscompanion
,
who
then
bumped
the
little
pewter
measure
upon
the
boy’shead
till
his
eyes
flashed
fire
.
<EOS>
Bill
whistled
to
the
horse
,
and
with
loud
laughter
,
the
two
ruffiansgalloped
up
the
Hampstead
-
road
,
which
was
then
as
innocent
of
“
Cottagesof
Gentility
”
as
is
the
Lake
of
Windermere
.
<EOS>
Up
the
hill
they
went
with
but
slightly
lessened
speed
,
nor
stoppedtill
they
were
quite
clear
of
all
the
little
suburban
houses
that
hereand
there
dotted
the
road
,
and
within
about
half
a
mile
of
the
villageof
Hampstead
itself
.
<EOS>
They
then
turned
down
Haverstock
Hill
,
which
wasquite
free
from
buildings
,
and
by
a
route
which
avoided
the
village
,
they
came
upon
the
verge
of
the
heath
.
<EOS>
“I
think
this
will
do
,
”
remarked
Bill
.
<EOS>
“I
think
so
too
,
”
said
the
other
.
<EOS>
“
How
precious
dark
it
is
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
”“You
may
say
that
.
<EOS>
I
’m
blowed
if
I
can
see
the
horse
’s
head
.
<EOS>
Woa
!
<EOS>
Woa!”They
both
now
alighted
,
and
led
the
horse
towards
a
thick
hedge
,
skirting
a
plantation
,
near
the
large
house
lately
occupied
by
LadyByron
.
<EOS>
Then
Bill
let
down
the
tail
-
board
of
the
cart
,
and
laying
holdof
Jacob
Gray
by
the
heels
,
he
dragged
him
out
,
and
letting
his
headcome
with
a
hard
bump
against
the
ground
,
which
was
by
no
means
likelyto
improve
his
faculties
.
<EOS>
They
then
pushed
him
along
with
their
feet
,
till
he
lay
completelyunder
the
hedge
,
and
could
not
come
to
any
harm
from
a
chance
vehicleor
horseman
.
<EOS>
“Well
<EOS>
,
”
remarked
Bill
,
“
I
think
we
have
done
that
job
handsomely
.
”“Uncommon
,
”
replied
his
companion
;
“
I
’d
give
something

<EOS>
”“He
will
look
about
him
a
bit
,
and
then
,
when
he
finds

gone
,
won’t

put
up
prayers
for

blessed
little

<EOS>
”Hampstead

was
striking
two
as
he
spoke
,
and
the
echo
of
thesounds
came
sweetly
and
solemnly
upon
the
night

<EOS>
Bill
whistled
to
the
horse
,
and
,
at
a
rapid
pace
,
the
thieves
took

What

the
happiness
that
gleamed
now
in

she
sat
with
Sir

on
the
morningafter
her
introduction
to

,
in
a
neat
and
prettily

arranged
room
,
overlooking
the
park
.
<EOS>
The
air
was
fresh
and
balmy
—
the
birds
were
flitting
past
the
windows
,
and
filled
the
atmosphere
with
music
.
<EOS>
Crowds
of
gaily
-
dressed
personswere
idly
sauntering
among
the
trees
;
enlivening
strains
of
martialmusic
came
wafted
to
her
ears
as
the
guard
was
changed
at
the
Palace
.
<EOS>
The
perfume
of
flowers
,
the
kind
words
of
Lady
Hartleton
,
and
kinderlooks

the
harmony
of
the
household
—
the
gay
laughter
from
children
whowere
chasing
each
other
in
a
neighbouring
garden
,
and
last
,
thoughgreatest
of
all
,
the
consciousness

freedom
from
Jacob

sofilled
the

with
delight

that
she
suddenly
threw
herselfinto
the
arms
of
Lady
Hartleton
,
and
with
a
flood
of
tears
,
said,—“Oh

How

Lady

What
youare

“Alas

The
cares

the
anxieties
,
the
awful
horrors
ofexistence
to
the

,
arise
from
their
artificial

Avarice

many

<EOS>
I

Canyou
wonder

then
,
that
I
thought
it
beautiful
<EOS>
—
I
am
as
one
who
had
beenconfined
for
many
,
many
years
,
in
a
dungeon
.
<EOS>
I
read
the
legend
in
abook
that
Albert
lent
to
me
.
<EOS>
For
many
years
,
then
,
this
poor
fatedbeing
had
not
seen
the
light
of
day
—
had
heard
nothing
but
the
harshgrating
of
his
dungeon
door
—
the
hideous
rattle
of
his
chains
,
until
atlast
one
day
there
came
struggling
like
a
sunbeam
upon
his
soul
,
astrain
of
music
.
’
<EOS>
Twas
a
common
air
,
and
played
unskilfully
,
but
to
himit
was
indeed
divine
.
<EOS>
”“The
prisoner
lived
to
bid
adieu
to
his
dungeon
,
and
he
came
abroadinto
the
great
world
.
<EOS>
He
heard
music
in
its
excellence
—
music
thatseemed
borrowed
from
Heaven
,
and
he
praised
;
admired
;
applauded
it
.
<EOS>
Butone
day
,
some
wandering
minstrel
,
with
a
careless
hand
,
struck
up
froma
rude
viol
the
strain
that
in
his
dungeon
had
so
sweetly
greeted
him
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
how
his
heart
bounded
,
like
a
bird
,
within
his
breast
—
how
a

danced
through
his

<EOS>
He
wept
,
he
sobbed
aloud
in

<EOS>
What
music
greeted
his
rapt
senses
like
that
!
<EOS>
He
hung
uponthe
minstrel
’s
neck
,
and
his
prayer
was—‘Oh

stay
ever
near
me
,
andwhen
<EOS>
I

play
to

that

’”Ada
ceased
speaking
,
and
Lady
Hartleton
caught
her
to
her
heart
,
as
shesaid,—“My

Ada
,
I
did
but
speak
for
the
pleasure

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
”“As
<EOS>
that
lonely

loved
the
strain

melody
that
greeted
hisdreary
solitude

sobbed
Ada

<EOS>
“
so
let
me
love
him
who
sought
me
outwhen
<EOS>
I
had
none

<EOS>
”“Your

<EOS>
”There
was
a
beautiful
and
earnest
simplicity
in
Ada
’s
manner
thatperfectly
charmed
Lady
Hartleton
,
and
she
encouraged
her
to
open
herheart
thoroughly
to
her
;
and
she
was
perfectly
astonished
at
the
richstore
of
poetry
,
beauty
,
and
virtue
which
lay
garnered
up
in
the
breastof
the
persecuted
and
beautiful
girl
—
stores
of
feeling
,
thought
,
andimagination
which
required
but
the
sunny
influence
of
kindness
to
bringforth
in
all
their
native
purity
and
beauty
.
<EOS>
Ada
now
gave
Lady
Hartleton
an
animated
description
of
her
whole
courseof
life
with
Jacob
Gray
,
commencing
at
her
earliest
recollection
ofbeing
with
him
in
various
mean
lodgings
,
and
coming
down
through
allthe
exciting
and
dangerous
scenes
she
had
passed
to
her
denunciation
ofhim
at
Charing
Cross
.
<EOS>
Lady
Hartleton
listened
to
her
narration
with
the
greatest
interest
,
and
when
Ada
had
concluded
,
she
said,—“And
you
have
still
no
clue
,
Ada
,
to
your
birth?”“None
—
none
.
<EOS>
The
mysterious
paper
addressed
to
your
husband
by
JacobGray
most
probably
contained
some
information
,
but
I
fear
that
is
lostfor
ever
.
<EOS>
”“A
<EOS>
more
strange
aad
eventful
history
<EOS>
I
never
heard
,
”
remarked
LadyHartleton
.
<EOS>
“
I
have
very
sanguine
hopes
that
the
activity
andexhaustless
energy
of
Sir
Francis
will
soon
clear
up
some
of
themysteries
that
surround
you
.
”“Heaven
<EOS>
grant
<EOS>
it
may
be
so
,
”
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“There
is
one
circumstance
that
must
not
be
lost
sight
of
,
as
it
mayafford
some
clue
or
corroborative
evidence
of
your
birth
—
that
is
,
thenecklace
you
sold
to
the
Jew
.
”“It
<EOS>
might
,
indeed
,
”
said
Ada
,
“
I
was
foolish
to
part
with
it
.
<EOS>
”“Should
<EOS>
you
know
the
shop
<EOS>
again?”“Certainly
<EOS>
I
should
,
and
the
man
likewise
.
<EOS>
My
intercourse
with
theworld
has
been
so
very
slight
that
I
am
not
confused
with
a
multitudeof
images
and
occurrences
.
<EOS>
Everything
that
has
happened
to
me
,
andevery
one
who
has
ever
spoken
to
me
,
stand
clear
and
distinct
in
mymemory

<EOS>
”“Then
<EOS>
the
necklace
may
be
recovered
.
<EOS>
”“Indeed!”“Without
doubt
;
Sir
Francis
will
get
it
back
for
you
.
”Lady
<EOS>
Hartleton
rang
the
bell
,
and
when
a
servant
appeared
,
she
said,—“Is
Sir
Francis
within?”“Yes
,
my
lady
,
”
was
the
reply
.
<EOS>
“
He
has
just
returned
from
the
Secretaryof
State
’s
office
.
<EOS>
”“Ask
him
to
come
here
.
<EOS>
”The
servant
bowed
and
retired
,
and
in
a
very
few
minutes
,
Sir
FrancisHartleton
entered
the
room
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
Ada
arose
and
welcomed
him
with
evident
pleasure
,
and
he
said,—“Well
,
Ada
,
<EOS>
are
you
happy
here?”“Too
happy
,
sir
,
”
she
said
,
with
emotion
.
<EOS>
“
It
requires
all
my
reason
toconvince
me
<EOS>
it
is
real
.
”Lady
<EOS>
Hartleton
then
related
to
her
husband
the
story
of
the
necklace
,
to
which
he
listened
with
grave
attention
.
<EOS>
At
its
conclusion
,
he
said,—“I
need
not
trouble
Ada
to
point
out
the
shop
.
<EOS>
The
description
issufficient

<EOS>
The
Jew

well
known

I
have
nodoubt
of
getting
back
the
necklace
if
it

this
country
.
<EOS>
Itmay
be
an
important
link
in
the
chain
of
evidence
concerning
Ada’sbirth
.
<EOS>
”“Have
<EOS>
you
any
thought
of
who
I
am
?
”
<EOS>
asked
Ada
,
with
eagerness
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
have
,
”
said
Sir
Francis
,
“
but
believe
and
trust
me
when
I
tell
youit
is
for
your

peace
of

and
happiness
that
I

rather

nothing

I
can
tell
you
something
which
has
a
firmer
basisthan

<EOS>
”“You
are
right
,
”
said
Ada
;
“
I
should
but
be
giving
my
imagination
play
,
and
torturing
my

with
perhaps
futile
fears

sanguinehopes
.
<EOS>
”“Hope

said
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
“
The

Ada

<EOS>
If

we

be
much

<EOS>
”“I

replied
Ada
,
<EOS>
“

show

never

hope

<EOS>
”“And
appreciation

Ada

said
the
magistrate
,
“

<EOS>
I
will
now
leave

a
little
time

<EOS>
”“He
<EOS>

<EOS>
In

I
know
little

fromwhat

”“No

”So
<EOS>
saying
,
Sir

bade
Ada
and
his

a
temporary
adieu

to

Destitution.—A

Spirit.—The

Applicationto
Learmont
,
and
the
Meeting
with
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
.
<EOS>
We
have
been
compelled
for
a
long
time
to
leave
the
gallant
andnoble
-
hearted
Albert
Seyton
to
follow
out
his
fortunes
unchronicled
inorder
to
depict
the
various
changing
scenes
in
the
life
of
Ada
,
who
,
now
that
she
is
conducted
to
a
haven
of
rest
for
a
while
,
we
can
leavein
calm
contentment
,
although
not
yet
,
fair
persecuted
girl
,
are
thytrials
done
!
<EOS>
The
sunshine
of
peace
and
joy
that
now
surrounds
you
isbut
a
prelude
to
a
storm
.
<EOS>
We
will
not
,
however
,
anticipate
but
allowthe
events
of
our
tale
to
flow
on
in
their
natural
course
like
a
mightyriver
,
which
,
as
it
nears
the
ocean
which
is
the
goal
of
its
destiny
,
sweeps
onwards
with
it
every
little
tributary
stream
and
murmuringrivulet
that
has
borrowed
a
brief
existence
from
it
.
<EOS>
After
the
death
of
his
father
,
the
scanty
means
of
support
which
theelder
Seyton
had
arising
from
the
tardy
justice
of
the
governmentceased
at
once
,
and
no
answer
was
returned
by
the
corrupt
minister
toAlbert
’s
application
,
not
for
a
continuance
of
his
father
’s
pension
,
but
for
honourable
employment
.
<EOS>
One
by
one
he
was
compelled
to
part
with
the
several
remnants
ofconvertable
property
which
his
father
had
left
behind
him
.
<EOS>
His
wholetime
was
occupied
in
searching
for
Ada
,
until
hope
sickened
intodespair
and
a
deep
gloom
began
to
spread
itself
like
a
vapour
beforethe
sun
over
his
heart
,
which
in
happier
circumstances
would
havethrobbed
with
every
free
,
noble
,
and
generous
emotion
.
<EOS>
Twice
he
had
called
upon
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
but
had
not
been
sofortunate
as
to
meet
with
him
,
and
the
second
disappointment
,
althoughit
was
purely
accidental
,
Albert
took
seriously
to
heart
,
and
in
thegloomy
confusion
of
his
imagination
,
arising
from
the
grief
thatoppressed
him
,
cemented
it
into
an
intentional
slight
,
and
never
calledagain
.
<EOS>
The
consequence
of
this
was
,
that
at
the
time
of
Ada’sintroduction
to
the
house
of
the
kind
and
humane
magistrate
,
she
wasentirely
ignorant
of
Albert
’s
place
of
abode
and
condition
in
life
.
<EOS>
Several
times
since
his
father
’s
death
the
young
man
had
shifted
hisresidence
,
for
he
could
not
bear
that
his
rapidly
decreasing
meansshould
become
a
subject
of
remark
,
even
although
a
pitying
one
,
and
nowhe
tenanted
a
small
room
in
a
narrow
court
,
near
the
Savoy
steps
in
theStrand
.
<EOS>
Absolute
destitution
was
now
rapidly
approaching
,
and
he
felt
that
thetime
was
quickly
coming
when
he
would
have
had
to
bid
adieu
for
ever
tothe
most
distant
hope
of
ever
again
beholding
Ada
;
and
to
save
himselffrom
starvation
,
enlisted
as
a
private
soldier
in
the
army
in
which
hisfather
had
held
a
commission
.
<EOS>
On
that
very
morning
that
Ada
was
sitting
in
the
little
room
commandingso
delightful
a
view
of
the
park
,
and
conversing
with
Lady
Hartleton
,
poor
Albert
sat
in
his
cheerless
apartment
with
his
head
resting
uponhis
hands
in
a
deep
reverie
composed
of
gloomy
and
heart
depressingthoughts
and
anticipations
.
<EOS>
“Alas
!
<EOS>
Alas
!
”
<EOS>
he
cried
.
<EOS>
“
My
beautiful
Ada
,
thou
art
lost
to
me
forever
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
why
did
I
leave
you
for
one
moment
to
the
mercy
of
that
man?I
am
rightly
punished
.
<EOS>
Having
by
the
merest
accident
—
by
one
of
thosehappy
chances
of
fortune
that
rarely
occur
twice
,
met
you
,
Ada
,
whenyou
were
wandering
in
this
great
city
,
I
madly
allowed
you
to
go
fromme
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
what
blindness
was
that
—
why
did
not
some
good
spirit
shriek‘beware
’
in
my
ears
?
<EOS>
Ada
—
Ada
,
I
have
lost
you
forever!”He
remained
for
some
moments
silent
,
and
suddenly
rising
he
cried,—“’Tis
in
vain
to
struggle
with
my
fate
.
<EOS>
My
lot
in
life
is
cast
,
and
Imust
stand
the
hazard
of
the
die
.
<EOS>
Ada
,
farewell
forever
,
I
must
take
astep
now
which
will
sever
us
for
ever
—
a
step
which
,
while
it
takes
fromme
my
freedom
of
action
,
places
me
in
a
situation
that
will
separate
mefrom
you
,
Ada
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
regiment
ordered
,
I
am
told
,
to
the
WestIndies
.
<EOS>
It
wants
recruits
—
with
it
will
I
go
,
and
bid
adieu
to
England
,
hope
,
and
Ada
.
<EOS>
”With
<EOS>
a
saddened
heart
,
and
yet
a
fixed
and
determined
aspect
,
he
nowproceeded
to
collect
and
pack
into
a
small
compass
such
few
papers
andsmall
cherished
articles
as
were
in
themselves
valueless
,
but
<EOS>
dear
tohim
as
the
words
of
his
father
.
<EOS>
There
was
one
book
,
too
,
in
the
insideof
the
cover
of
which
Ada
,
when
quite
young
,
had
written
the
name
<EOS>
of“Harry”—and
underneath
“
Albert
.
”
<EOS>
This
one
word
of
her
whom
he
loved
sowell
he
placed
next
his
heart
,
with
a
determination
that
death
shouldalone
part
him
and
it
.
<EOS>
He
then
destroyed
a
number
of
letters
whichwould
have
encumbered
him
,
and
which
possessed
no
very
peculiarfeatures
of
interest
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
he
paused
over
one
of
those
notes
,
as
he
was
about
to
tearit
across
,
and
as
he
read
it
it
suggested
one
last
hope
to
his
mind
.
<EOS>
The
reader
will
recollect
that
previous
to
his
long
and
dangerousillness
,
Albert
Seyton
had
applied
to
Learmont
,
whom
he
knew
but
<EOS>
as
thereported
richest
commoner
in
the
kingdom
,
for
the
situation
ofsecretary
to
him
,
and
had
received
not
a
distinct
,
but
certainly
anencouraging
reply
.
<EOS>
Before
,
however
,
Albert
could
follow
up
the
application
his
illness
hadplaced
so
long
an
interval
between
the
first
proceeding
and
that
whichwould
have
been
the
second
,
that
not
doubting
Learmont
was
long
sincesuited
,
he
had
taken
no
further
steps
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
It
was
Learmont’snote
dated
far
back
which
now
caught
his
eye
,
and
made
him
in
thepresent
desperate
state
of
his
fortunes
adopt
the
sudden
notion
ofcalling
with
it
in
his
hand
and
explaining
the
cause
of
the
long
delay
,
which
might
interest
the
rich
and
powerful
squire
to
give
him
arecommendation
to
some
one
else
,
if
he
could
not
himself
employ
him
.
<EOS>
“A
drowning
man
,
”
exclaimed
Albert
,
“
they
say
,
will
catch
at
a
straw
,
and
upon
the
same
principle
I
will
cling
to
this
one
slender
hope
.
”
<EOS>
Heread
the
letter
carefully
,
which
ran
thus:—If
<EOS>
Mr.
Seyton
will
call
upon
Mr.
Learmont
at
his
house
any
morningbefore
eleven
he
will
oblige
him
,
and
they
will
converse
on
Mr
.
<EOS>
Seyton
’s
<EOS>
application
.
<EOS>
This
was
very
brief
,
but
still
amply
sufficient
to
found
a
call
upon
,
and
Albert
placing
it
in
his
pocket
,
and
trimming
up
as
well
as
hecould
his
faded
apparel
,
donned
his
hat
,
and
with
a
quick
active
stepproceeded
towards
Learmont
’s
house
.
<EOS>
What
an
estimable
thing
to
youth
is
hope
,
and
from
what
a
small
tinyplant
will
it
grow
in
the
human
breast
to
wondrous
size
and
beauty
.
<EOS>
The
freshness
of
the
morning
,
the
sunshine
and
the
feeling
that
therewas
yet
another
chance
for
him
,
slight
as
it
was
,
chased
many
of
thephantoms
of
gloom
and
despair
from
his
mind
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
long
in
arriving
at
Learmont
’s
house
and
entering
the
hall
,
for
it
was
the
fashion
then
of
many
of
the
wealthy
to
keep
theirouter
-
doors
open
,
and
trust
to
the
throng
of
servant
<EOS>
’s
they
kept
intheir
halls
,
to
defend
them
from
any
improper
intrusion
.
<EOS>
He
inquiredfor
Learmont
.
<EOS>
He
was
replied
to
by
a
question
concerning
his
business
,
when
luckily
recollecting
his
letter
,
he
produced
it
,
saying,—“I
have
a
note
from
the
squire
,
requesting
my
attendance
upon
him
.
”“Oh
,
”
said
a
servant
,
“
if
that
is
the
case
,
young
sir
,
I
will
take
yourname
in
.
<EOS>
Pray
follow
me
.
<EOS>
”Albert
followed
the
man
,
and
was
conducted
into
a
small
,
butmagnificent
apartment
,
with
an
exquisitely
painted
roof
,
and
hung
withcrimson
damask
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
waited
long
when
the
servant
re
-
appeared
to
say,—“that
hismaster
had
no
sort
of
recollection
of
the
affair
,
and
wished
to
see
hisown
letter
which
the
stranger
said
he
had
.
<EOS>
”“Here
is
the
letter
,
”
said
Albert
;
“
but
his
worship
will
see
by
thedate
,
that
the
time
therein
mentioned
scarcely
authorises
my
presentvisit
.
<EOS>
Be
so
good
as
to
add
that
long
illness
and
the
death
of
one
nearand
dear
to
me
,
accounts
for
the
delay
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
man
took
the
note
and
was
away
for
some
time
,
when
he
entered
andrequested
Albert
Seyton
to
follow
him
,
for
that
his
master
would
seehim
.
<EOS>
He
was
then
conducted
through
a
magnificent
suite
of
rooms
,
until
theservant
paused
at
a
door
which
was
a
little
way
open
.
<EOS>
At
this
heknocked
gently
,
and
a
deep
-
toned
hollow
voice
from
within
said,—“Come
in
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
servant
motioned
Albert
Seyton
to
enter
the
apartment
,
and
in
thenext
moment
he
was
in
the
presence
of
Learmont
,
who
fixed
his
keensearching
eyes
upon
the
young
man
’s
<EOS>
face
for
several
moments
before
hespoke
.
<EOS>
Then
he
said
in
a
low
tone,—“Young
man
,
your
application
now
can
scarcely
be
considered
asencouraged
by
me
.
<EOS>
The
note
you
have
bears
date
a
long
time
back
.
<EOS>
”“It
<EOS>
does
,
sir
,
”
replied
Albert
;
“
but
I
have
been
on
a
bed
of
sicknessmyself
,
and
am
now
bereft
of
the
parent

<EOS>
’s
<EOS>
feelings
would
not
permit
him
to
say
more
,
and
he
paused
.
<EOS>
“Are
you
<EOS>
an
orphan
?
”
said
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“I
am
.
<EOS>
”“And
poor
and
friendless
—
and
,
and
very
nearly
driven
to
despair
?
<EOS>
Haveyou
found
out
what
a
hollow
cheat
the
care
of
Providence
is
?
<EOS>
Are
youone
of
Fortune
’s
foot
-
balls
,
kicked
here
<EOS>
and
there
as

<EOS>
Have
you
met
with
ingratitude
where
you
should
have
hadsuccour
?
<EOS>
Contempt
where
you
trusted
upon
honour
—
derision

you
wentfor

<EOS>
—
are
you
,
young

,
one
of
those
who
have
seen
enough
ofmisery
to
retaliate
upon
the
world
?
<EOS>
Speak
,
young
man
,
are
you
such
as
Ihave
described?”There
was
a
kind
of
subdued
,
snarling
tone
of
vehemence
in
theutterance
of
these
words
by
Learmont
,
that
surprised
Albert
Seyton
asmuch
as
the
words
themselves
were
unexpected
.
<EOS>
After
a
moment
’s
pause
hereplied,—“Sir
,
I
scarce
know
how
to
answer
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
,
it
is
true
,
poor
,
friendless
,
and
an
orphan
;
I
have
met
with
ingratitude
when
I
shouldhave
met
friendship
;
cold
indifference
instead
of
ardent
sympathy
;
but
,
<EOS>
sir
,
I
thank
Heaven
that
poor
,
nearly
destitute
as
I
am
,
my
heart
islight
as
thistle
-
down
in
its
innocence
of
wrong
,
and
from
my
inmostsoul
do
I
look
up
to
and
acknowledge
that
Providence
that
watches
overall
.
<EOS>
You
have
jested
with
me
,
sir
.
<EOS>
”“In
<EOS>
truth
have
I
,
”
said
Learmont
;
“
it
is
my
custom
with
a
stranger
,
heed
it
not

<EOS>
When
I
want
a

heartedsecretary

you
may
be
assured
that
I
will
send
for
you

<EOS>
”A
<EOS>
pang
of
disappointment
shot
across
the
heart
of
Albert
Seyton
asLearmont
spoke
,
and
he
replied
sadly,—“Farewell
,
sir
,
you
will
send
for
me
in
vain
.
<EOS>
This
day
,
if
unacceptedby
you
,
I
enter
the
ranks
as
a
soldier
.
”“Indeed
,
are
you
so
hardly
pressed?”“Heaven
knows
I
am
indeed
.
<EOS>
For
myself
,
sir
,
I
care
not
,
but
in
my
fateis
involved
that
of
another
.
<EOS>
”“What
<EOS>
other
?
”
said
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“Alas
,
sir
,
the
tale
is
long
,
and
its
telling
useless
.
”“Young
<EOS>
man
,
”
said
Learmont
earnestly
,
“
there
is
a
matter
in
which
Icould
give
you
good
employment
,
but
it
is
one
requiring
secresy
,
prudence
,
and
deep
caution
.
<EOS>
”“If
<EOS>
it
be
honourable
,
sir

”
said
Seyton
,
“
I
will
freely
undertake

beset
with
dangers

<EOS>
”“’Tis
<EOS>
a
reach
above
honourable

”
said
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“
The
object
isabsolutely
pious
.
<EOS>
”This
was
said
in
so
strange
a
tone
that
Albert
was
puzzled
to
make
uphis
mind
if
it
were
sincere
or
honourable
,
and
he
remained
silent
,
expecting
Learmont
to
go
on
with
what
he
was
saying
.
<EOS>
“It
is
a
trifling
service
,
”
said
Learmont
,
“
and
yet
by
trifles
I
everestimate
good
service
.
<EOS>
I
fear
me
,
much
,
young
man
,
that
in
this
greatcity
there
is
great
wickedness

”“No
<EOS>
doubt

”
said
Albert
,
“
and
I
should
not
object
to
any
service
thathad
for
its
end
a
righteous
object

”“Sagely
<EOS>
and
wisely
spoken
,
young

said
Learmont
;
“
I
give
awaylarge
sums
to
those
who
are
in

some
days

there
came

a

told
a
piteous
tale

there
were

someglaring

<EOS>
I
relieved

The

not

With
much
doublings

eluded

“And
you

it?”“I

<EOS>
The
manner
of
Learmontwas
so
much
at
variance
with
his
words
that
Albert
irresistibly
came
tothe
conclusion
that
there
was
something
more
than
had
been
explained
tohim
connected
with
the
service
he
was
asked
to
perform
of
watching
tohis
home
an
unfortunate
beggar
.
<EOS>
“Still
,
”
he
thought
,
“
I
may
be
mistaken
,
and
blaming
this
man
forfaults
of
nature
.
<EOS>
He
may
be
benevolent
and
just
,
as
he
reports
himselfto
be
,
but
still
afflicted
with
as
roguish
and
villanous
a
face
as
everfell
to
the
lot
of
mortal
man
.
<EOS>
It
will
not
do
always
to
trust
toappearances
,
and
I
should
be
foolish
indeed
to
forsake
an
honourableemployment
for
perhaps
a
mere
chimera
of
the
imagination

<EOS>
I
can
leavehim

I

at

willplease
myself

”When
<EOS>
Learmont
was
once
more
alone
,
and
the
echo
of
the
retiringfootsteps
of
Albert
Seyton
had
died
away
,
he
muttered
indistinctly
tohimself
for
some
moments
.
<EOS>
Then
,
as
he
grew
more
confident
in
thesuccess
of
some
stratagem
which
he
had
connived
,
he
spoke
with
a
toneof
exultation
.
<EOS>
“Yes
,
”
he
said
,
“

favoured

The
granddifficulty

in

What
noise
was
that?”Some
slight
creaking
of
an
article
of
furniture
sent
the
blood
with
afrightful
rush
to
his
heart
,
and
he
remained
for
several
momentstrembling
excessively
,
and
clutching
the
edge
of
the
oaken
table

<EOS>
Then
,
with
a
deep
sigh
,
he
again
spoke,—“’Twas

”He
<EOS>
slowly
crept
to
the
door
,
and
kept
softly
muttering
unintelligiblewords
with
his
cold

livid
lips

till
he
had
passed
out

closed

Laughter
at

reached

smote
his

with

Reward
.
<EOS>
The
birds
were
singing
merrily
,
and
skimming
over
Jacob
Gary
<EOS>
’s
<EOS>
headlong
before
he
awoke
from
the
effects
of
the
drugged
wine
that
had
beenadministered
to
him
by
the
considerate
friends
he
had
met
with
.
<EOS>
Themorning
sun
was
shining
upon
his
pale
,
haggard
face
,
lighting
even
itup
with
some
appearance
of
less
ghastliness
,
and
yet
there
he
laymotionless
,
as
if
dead
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
favourite
theory
of
dreams
with
somephilosophers
,
that
such
visions
of
the
fancy
never
occur
but
at
themoment
or
two
before
awakening
,
or
at
the
moment
of
losingconsciousness
by
going
to
sleep
,
or
in
other
words
that
we
dream
onlywhen
not
fully
slumbering
.
<EOS>
It
would
appear
that
this
was
the
case
with
Jacob
Gray
;
for
,
as
thebirds
sung
above
him
,
and
the
sun
gleamed
upon
him
,
while
a
crow
wouldoccasionally
flap
his
face
as
it
flew
over
him
,
his
perception
appearedhalf
to
return
,
and
his
face
became
bedewed
with
a
heavy
perspiration
,
as
some
fearful
images
of
his
past
life
came
across
his
mental
vision
.
<EOS>
His
thoughts
were
evidently
wandering
back
to
the
fearful
night
of
thefire
at
the
Old
Smithy
,
and
his
busy
fancy
was
enacting
over
again
thatdreadful
drama
of
blood
.
<EOS>
He
tossed
his
arms
wildly
to
and
fro
,
and
groaned
and
uttered
thehalf
-
stifled
screams
which
came
from
a
disturbed
stupor
,
in
the
agonyof
his
mind
.
<EOS>
“Save
—
save
her
,
”
he
said
.
<EOS>
“
The
child
of
the
dead
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
do
the
deed
.
<EOS>
Help
,
oh
,
help
me
,
my
heart
is
burning
—
charring
in
my
breast
.
”He
<EOS>
then
,
in
his
intense
mental
suffering
,
bit
his
under
lip
till
theblood
trickled
on
to
his
breast
,
and
with
the
actual
pain
he
awoke
,
crying—“Spare
me
—
spare
me
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
do
not
scorch
my
eye
-
balls
<EOS>
so
—
my
brain
is
onfire
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
God
,
have
mercy
—
mercy
—
mercy
.
”He
<EOS>
opened
his
eyes
,
and
the
full
glare
of
the
sunlight
fell
upon
them
,
blinding
him
for
the
moment
.
<EOS>
Then
he
opened
them
again
,
and
glancedaround
him
in
speechless
wonder
as
to
where
he
was
.
<EOS>
His
first
impression
was
that
he
was
dead
,
and
in
some
other
world
.
<EOS>
Then
he
clasped
his
hands
over
his
face
and
then
tried
to
think
.
<EOS>
But
aconfusion
and
want
of
images
in
his
brain
quite
rendered
such
an
effortvain
,
and
at
length
he
became
only
alive
to
so
horrible
a
sensation
ofthirst
that
he
shrieked
aloud,—“Water
—
water
<EOS>
—
water!”He
rose
to
his
knees
,
and
glaring
around
him
with
his
parched
tonguehanging
from
his
mouth
,
he
saw
a
shining
sheet
of
limpid
water
at
somedistance
before
him
.
<EOS>
Then
,
still
gasping
the
word
“
water
”
he
attemptedto
rise
,
but
so
confused
was
his
head
from
the
effects
of
the
opiatethat
had
been
so
unstintingly
administered
to
him
,
<EOS>
that
,
aftertottering
a
step
or
two
,
he
sank
to
the
earth
again
.
<EOS>
His
awful
thirstwas
however
,
unbearable
,
and
with
a
dizzy
brow
and
aching
eyes
,
hecrawled
on
his
hands
and
knees
towards
the
pond
.
<EOS>
He
was
long
in
reaching
it
,
for
he
deviated
from
the
strait
tracklargely
;
but
when
he
did
,
oh
,
what
an
exquisite
pleasure
<EOS>
it
was
to
lieby
the
brink
and
dash
his
head
in
,
drinking
up
huge
quantities
andcausing
the
cold
stream
to
bubble
in
his
mouth
and
ears
.
<EOS>
Not
till
his
breath
was
exhausted
did
Jacob
Gray
raise
his
head
fromthe
pond
,
and
then
,
when
he
did
so
,
recollection
returned
to
him
up
tothe
point
when
he
had
sat
down
to
supper
with
his
two
suspiciousfriends
in
the
court
.
<EOS>
With
a
cry
that
had
something
unearthly
in
it
,
hehurriedly
thrust
his
hands
into
all
his
pockets
,
then
with
a
wildshriek
,
he
grovelled
on
the
ground
,
dashing
his
head
upon
it
,
andclutching
the
grass
with
his
hands
as
he
cried,—“Gone
—
gone
—
<EOS>
all
gone
—
that
I
have
toiled
for
—
beggared
,
ruined
,
gone
.
<EOS>
”Then
<EOS>
he
lay
on
his
back
,
panting
,
as
he
looked
into
the
clear
,
quietpool
before
him
,
refecting
,
as
it
did
,
<EOS>
the
face
of
Heaven
in
its
glassysurface
<EOS>
,
the
thought
came
over
him
of
plunging
in
,
and
at
once
ending
alife
of
never
-
ending
misery
.
<EOS>
“Is
it
easy
to
drown
?
”
<EOS>
he
asked
himself
;
“
or
are
there
unknown
hours
ofmaddening
torture
,
after
we
think
,
by
the
cessation
of
all
movement
<EOS>
,
life
is
<EOS>
gone?”He
crawled
towards
the
bank
of
the
stream
,
and
leaning
over
it
,
hegazed
long
and
earnestly
into
its
clear
blue
depths
,
it
seemed
milesdown
in
the
immensity
of
space
,
for
now
the
ripples
he
had
created
hadall
subsided
,
and
there
was
scarcely
the
slightest
trembling
of
thereflected
visage
of
the
sky
in
the
glassy
stream
.
<EOS>
Then
with
a
shudder
he
withdrew
,
slowly
.
<EOS>
“I
dare
not
—
I
dare
not
,
”
he
moaned
.
<EOS>
“
It
is
for
those
of
more
unstainedsouls
than
mine
to
take
the
awful
leap
from
here
to
eternity
,
and
hopeto
be
forgiven
—
not
for
me
—
not
for
me
—
I
dare
not

<EOS>
Yet
where
is
now
myphilosophy
?
<EOS>
There
is
no
eternity
—
<EOS>
no
,
no
—
we
are
all
here
but
to
play
ourparts
in
a
great
drama
.
<EOS>
What
have
I
to
fear
?
<EOS>
Nothing
—
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
—
I
—
believe
in
nothing
.
<EOS>
”Oh
<EOS>
how
the
abject
terror
depicted
in
his
countenance
belied
his
words
.
<EOS>
He
was
striving
to
cheat
himself
by
the
lying
effusions
of
his
owntongue
,
while
his
heart
was
a
haven
of
despair
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
his
attention
was
arrested
by
a
man
singing
,
as
he
ascended
tothe
high
ground
,
upon
which
Jacob
Gray
was
lying
.
<EOS>
The
strain
was
amerry
one
,
and
jarred
strangely
upon
the
half
-
maddened
ears
of
Gray
,
who
had
just
sufficient
prudence
left
him
to
feel
the
necessity
,
in
hispresent
position
,
of
not
giving
any
clue
to
suspicion
,
for
he
feltthat
,
in
his
weak
and
abject
condition
,
a
child
might
have
arrested
him
.
<EOS>
He
accordingly
rested
his
head
upon
his
arm
,
in
as
unconcerned
anattitude
as
he
could
assume
,
and
awaited
the
coming
of
the
man
who
wasnow
within
a
few
paces
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
coarsely
and
roughly
attired
,
andevidently
belonged
to
a
very
low
grade
of
society
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
noticeJacob
Gray
till
he
apparently
came
full
upon
him
,
then
he
cried,—“Hilloa
,
friend
,
you
rise
betimes
.
<EOS>
I
call
it
over
work
getting
up
soearly
.
<EOS>
”“Yes
,
”
said
Gray
,
“
I
—
I
am
up
soon
.
<EOS>
I
like
the
cool
air
of
the
morning
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
man
looked
very
earnestly
at
him
,
and
Gray
’s
heart
sunk
within
himat
the
thought
that
he
was
about
to
be
recognised
and
taken
.
<EOS>
He
madeone
effort
to
save
himself
by
<EOS>
quietly
adding,—“It
’s
<EOS>
nothing
to
me
to
be
in
the
fields
early
or
late
.
<EOS>
I
am
well
armed
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
man
stepped
back
a
pace
at
this
intimation
,
and
Gray
saw
thatwhether
or
not
the
man
had
any
criminal
designs
against
his
liberty
,
hehad
succeeded
in
awakening
his
fears
.
<EOS>
“No
offence
,
sir
,
”
he
said—“no
offence
,
I
hope
—
I’m
a
poor
fellow
,
comeupon
business
from
Westminister
.
”“Oh
!
<EOS>
From
Westminister
,
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
Then
he
paused
,
and
fixed
an
eagersearching
glance
upon
the
man
,
who
added,—“Have
<EOS>
you
heard
of
the
murder
last
night
,
sir
,
of
Mr.
Vaughan?”“No
,
”
said
Gray
,
“
I
have
not
been
in
London
for
some
time
,
although
Ihave
very
nearly
wandered
out
of
my
track
.
<EOS>
”A
<EOS>
clock
at
this
moment
chimed
some
quarters
,
and
the
man
said,—“The
clock
of
the
old
church
at
Hampstead
sounds
clearly
across
thefields
.
<EOS>
”“At
<EOS>
Hampstead
,
”
muttered
Gray
,
gazing
earnestly
around
him
,
for
he
wasas
ignorant
as
possible
of
the
locality
in
which
he
rightly
surmised
hehad
been
left
by
those
who
had
eased
him
of
all
his
wealth
.
<EOS>
“Yes
,
there
’s
the
church
peeping
among
the
tree
,
sir
,
”
added
the
man
.
<EOS>
“I
know
it
well
,
”
said
Gray
,
“
my
family
all
lie
buried
in
its
humblegraveyard
.
<EOS>
”“Oh
,
indeed
,
sir
,
”
said
the
man
,
and
then
he
went
with
a
slow
steptowards
a
tree
,
and
taking
a
little
tin
can
and
a
brush
from
hispocket
<EOS>
,
he
began
lathering
it
with
paste
.
<EOS>
Gray
watched
his
proceedings
with
intense
curiosity
,
for
he
could
notsurmise
what
he
could
possibly
be
about
to
do
.
<EOS>
All
wonder
andconjecture
were
,
however
,
speedily
set
at
rest
,
for
the
man
took
alarge
printed
bill
from
his
hat
,
and
the
first
word
that
struck
JacobGray
was
the
awful
and
ominous
one
of
“
Murder
”
in
large
letters
on
thetop
.
<EOS>
The
man
pasted
the
bill
on
to
the
trunk
of
the
tree
carefully
andevenly
,
and
then
he
paused
for
a
moment
,
and
in
a
low
,
mumbling
voice
,
read
it
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
was
in
such
a
position
that
he
could
not
see
the
smallerprint
of
the
bill
with
sufficient
distinctness
to
read
it
.
<EOS>
The
one
wordat
the
top
—
murder
,
only
came
out
strongly
and
clearly
to
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
Thatthe
placard
concerned
him
,
he
never
for
a
moment
doubted
,
and
now
hisagony
became
intense
,
at
the
thought
that
the
man
was
most
probablythen
engaged
in
mentally
concerning
his
Gray
’s
,
personal
appearance
,
with
a
description
of
him
in
the
bill
.
<EOS>
His
anxiety
while
the
man
was
reading
became
so
intense
,
that
he
couldneither
speak
nor
move
,
and
it
was
not
until
the
man
turned
to
him
,
andsaid,—“A
horrid
murder
,
sir
,
it
seems
,
”
that
he
found
breath
to
answer
him
,
in
a
confused
manner
.
<EOS>
“Yes
—
yes
,
”
he
said
,
“
a
very
horrid
murder
.
<EOS>
Have
you
caught
themurderer?”“No
,
sir
—
<EOS>
but
there
’s
a
hundred
pounds
reward
offered
for
him
,
and
billsare
being
stuck
all
over
London
,
and
within
ten
miles
,
with
adescription
of
him
.
”“Indeed
,
”
said
Gray
,
a
violent
trembling
coming
over
him
.
<EOS>
“
I
am
glad
<EOS>
Iam
so
well
armed
,
that
I
hold
several
men
’s
<EOS>
lives
in
my
power
;
so
,
yousee
,
should
I
meet
him
<EOS>
,
I
am
safe
from
him
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
man
again
went
back
a
few
paces
upon
hearing
this
declaration
,
andsaid
with
an
appearance
of
fright,—“Certainly
,
sir
—
<EOS>
oh
—
of
course
,
good
morning
,
sir
.
<EOS>
”“Good
<EOS>
morning
,
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
In
a
moment
the
man
turned
,
and
walk
downed
the
hill
at
a
pace
whichJacob
Gray
could
see
he
was
momentarily
increasing
,
as
he
placed
agreater
distance
between
them
.
<EOS>
“He
suspects
me
!
<EOS>
He
suspects
me
!
”
<EOS>
gasped
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
He
has
only
gone
to
getassistance
to
capture
me
.
<EOS>
Whither
can
I
now
fly
?
<EOS>
I
can
purchase
no
moresafety
,
for
I
am
penniless
.
<EOS>
Die
I
dare
not
—
must
I
be
taken
—
<EOS>
oh
,
horror
—
horror
!
<EOS>
The
scaffold
dances
before
my
eyes
,
and
I
seem
even
nowto
hear
the
shouts
of
the
multitude
as
I
am
dragged
out
to
die
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
shook
for
several
moments
fearfully
,
then
with
blanched
lips
andtottering
limbs
,
he
rose
and
approached
the
tree
on
which
was
postedthe
placard
.
<EOS>
For
a
minute
or
more
,
the
letter
seemed
to
dance
beforehis
bewildered
gaze
,
and
he
could
read
nothing
but
the
one
word“Murder
,
”
which
appeared
as
it
were
to
stand
out
from
the
paper
with
asupernatural
distinctness
.
<EOS>
Gradually
,
however
,
this
nervous
delusion
vanished
,
and
the
lettersarranged
themselves
like
living
things
in
their
proper
places
.
<EOS>
JacobGray
then
read
the
bill
,
which
offered
a
reward
of
one
hundred
poundsto
any
one
who
would
apprehend
and
lodge
in
any
gaol
the
perpetrator
ofthe
murder
.
<EOS>
The
placard
then
went
on
to
give
but
an
imperfectdescription
of
Gray
’s
person
,
and
concluded
by
the
name
of
one
of
themagistrates
of
the
metropolis
.
<EOS>
There
were
two
things
that
surprised
Gray
in
this
placard
.
<EOS>
One
was
,
that
his
name
was
not
mentioned
,
and
the
other
was
,
that
no
referencewas
made
to
any
other
real
or
supposed
crime
than
the
murder
of
the
manVaughan
,
in
the
court
leading
from
the
Strand
.
<EOS>
Through
Ada
,
who
had
so
fearlessly
denounced
him
,
he
had
made
sure
thathis
name
would
become
public
,
and
that
his
other
crime
of
recent
date
,
namely
,
the
murder
of
the
officer
Elias
,
in
the
house
at
Battersea
,
would
have
become
known
,
and
form
as
direct
and
distinct
a
chargeagainst
him
as
that
of
Vaughan
,
which
was
the
least
criminal
act
of
thetwo
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
’s
name
did
not
appear
to
thedocument
,
which
was
as
great
a
surprise
to
Gray
as
anything
,
for
heconjectured
that
to
him
,
Ada
would
make
her
first
appeal
for
protection
.
<EOS>
Altogether
the
bill
tormented
and
puzzled
Jacob
Gray
,
and
he
continuedgazing
at
it
,
until
again
the
letters
danced
before
his
fevered
brain
,
and
calm
reflection
became
lost
in
a
whirl
of
contending
fears
.

CHAPTER
<EOS>
LXIII.Gray
<EOS>
’s
Proceedings.—A
Narrow
<EOS>
Escape.—The
Night
Visit
to
Learmont
.
<EOS>
The
necessity
for
some
immediate
movement
,
in
order
to
insure
hispersonal
safety
,
now
came
strongly
across
the
oppressed
and
waveringmind
of
Gray
,
and
hastily
tearing
down
the
bill
from
the
tree
,
heclasped
his
throbbing
temples
with
his
hands
,
and
strove
to
reduce
histhoughts
to
order
and
consistency
.
<EOS>
That
the
bill
-
sticker
had
gone
toget
assistance
to
apprehend
him
,
was
the
frightful
notion
that
neverfor
one
instant
left
his
mind
,
and
without
any
definite
notion
of
wherehe
<EOS>
was
going
,
he
went
round
the
declivity
of
the
hill
,
until
he
arrivedcompletely
on
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
The
only
means
of
concealment
that
therepresented
itself
was
a
thick
hedge
,
but
then
he
thought
how
veryinsecure
a
place
of
refuge
<EOS>
would
that
be
,
in
the
event
of
an
activesearch
being
made
for
him
.
<EOS>
The
country
before
him
was
level
for
a
considerable
distance
,
with
onlyhere
<EOS>
and
there
a
small
clump
of
trees
.
<EOS>
After
some
minutes
more
ofpainful
thought
an
idea
suggested
itself
to
him
,
which
was
very
much
inaccordance
with
his
usual
complicated
habits
of
thought
.
<EOS>
That
was
,
toleave
some
portions
of
his
apparel
on
the
bank
of
the
pond
,
to
induce
abelief
that
he
had
drowned
himself
in
its
waters
,
and
then
to
scrambleinto
one
of
the
trees
,
and
hide
till
nightfall
among
the
branches
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
only
feasible
plan
of
escape
that
suggested
itself
to
him
,
for
with
his
utter
ignorance
of
the
localities
of
the
fields
,
anattempt
to
cross
them
to
the
village
would
most
probably
be
seen
,
andbut
a
short
race
in
his
exhausted
and
sickly
state
would
ensure
hiscapture
.
<EOS>
“
At
night
,
”
he
thought
,
“
I
will
venture
to
Learmont’s
—
it
is
myonly
chance
.
<EOS>
I
will
then
offer
for
a
thousand
pounds
to
deliver
up
Adato
him
,
and
he
still
supposing
,
probably
,
that
nothing
material
hashappened
,
<EOS>
may
consent
,
when
I
will
find
a
means
of
leaving
England
forever
,
and
mature
at
my
leisure
plans
of
revenge
against
them
all
.
<EOS>
Butnow
most
of
all
,
Ada
,
will
I
mark
you
well
.
<EOS>
You
,
who
have
reduced
me
tomy
present
state
,
my
bitterest
malediction
light
upon
you
.
<EOS>
I
would
,
Icould
have
made
you
great
and
wealthy
,
but
now
I
will
devise
somefinely
woven
scheme
to
revenge
myself
on
those
I
hate
,
without
missingyou
.
”He
<EOS>
then
laid
several
articles
of
his
clothing
by
the
bank
of
the
pondto
which
he
had
walked
,
while
the
reflections
we
have
worded
werepassing
through
his
brain
.
<EOS>
Then
hastily
repairing
to
one
of
the
clumpsof
trees
we
have
mentioned
,
he
with
much
difficulty
and
pain
,
for
hewas
sadly
bruised
,
contrived
to
ascend
it
,
and
although
the
pangs
ofhunger
began
,
even
now
to
harass
him
,
he
resolved
that
the
shadows
ofevening
should
shroud
all
things
before
he
ventured
from
his
retreat
.
<EOS>
From
his
elevated
position
he
now
commanded
a
good
view
of
thesurrounding
country
,
and
far
down
the
hill
he
had
first
ascended
,
hesaw
the
forms
of
three
persons
rapidly
approaching
.
<EOS>
At
that
distance
he
could
not
see
their
forms
distinctly
,
but
as
theyneared
the
brow
of
the
hill
,
he
felt
no
doubt
that
one
of
them
was
theman
who
had
stuck
the
placard
to
the
tree
.
<EOS>
Now
he
saw
them
pause
<EOS>
andpoint
forwards
,
then
with
an
accelerated
pace
they
all
three
advancedtowards
<EOS>
the
tree
near
which
the
bill
sticker
had
left
them
.
<EOS>
They
nowpaused
,
and
appeared
to
be
consulting
upon
their
next
step
,
when
oneapparently
saw
the
articles
of
clothing
which
Gray
had
left
by
the
bankof
the
pond
,
and
they
all
came
to
the
spot
using
gestures
to
each
otherof
astonishment
.
<EOS>
They
remained
for
several
minutes
in
close
consultation
now
,
and
thenas
if
in
accordance
with
an
arrangement
they
had
just
made
,
one
of
themremained
by
the
pond
while
the
others
commenced
carefully
peering
intothe
hedges
and
bushes
.
<EOS>
After
satisfying
themselves
that
he
they
sought
was
not
immediately
athand
,
they
both
ran
up
Traitor’s
-
hill
,
and
from
its
summit
took
a
longsearching
glance
at
all
the
surrounding
fields
.
<EOS>
One
of
these
men
,
Graycould
see
now
to
his
intense
fright
,
had
a
gun
in
his
hand
,
and
thatfright
was
increased
to
absolute
abject
terror
when
he
saw
him
level
itat
one
of
the
trees
in
the
vicinity
,
and
fire
among
the
branches
,
awakening
many
echoes
and
starting
from
their
covert
many
birds
whoflew
twittering
and
screaming
from
among
the
branches
.
<EOS>
Then
to
his
agony
he
saw
the
gun
again
loaded
,
and
the
man
pointed
itat
another
tree
and
fired
.
<EOS>
The
sharp
report
went
through
Jacob
Gray’sexcited
brain
like
electricity
,
and
it
was
only
by
twining
his
feetround
an
arm
of
the
tree
in
which
he
was
,
and
clutching
another
withhis
hands
,
that
he
saved
himself
from
falling
in
his
agitation
to
theground
.
<EOS>
The
two
men
now
conversed
for
some
minutes
in
an
undertone
.
<EOS>
Then
oneraising
his
voice
,
said
in
a
tone
that
came
clearly
to
Jacob
Gray’sanxiously
straining
ears,—“Oh
,
do
n’t
give
it
up
yet
—
<EOS>
it
’s
worth
a
try
.
<EOS>
”“So
<EOS>
it
is
,
but
<EOS>
it
’s
a
bore
to
fire
away
so
much
powder
for
nothing,”said
the
other
.
<EOS>
“Oh
,
nonsense
,
blaze
away
,
”
said
the
first
,
“
I
call
it
good
sport
.
<EOS>
”“Well
<EOS>
,
here
goes
then
,
”
remarked
the
man
with
the
gun
,
as
hedeliberately
rammed
down
another
charge
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
now
trembled
so
excessively
that
had
the
men
been
near
athand
<EOS>
the
shaking
of
the
branches
of
the
tree
must
have
at
once
betrayedhim
;
but
fortunately
for
him
they
were
too
much
occupied
with
the
treesthey
were
firing
into
to
heed
any
other
at
a
distance
,
however
short
.
<EOS>
As
they
came
sauntering
on
,
Jacob
Gray
with
a
deep
groan
that
he
couldnot
repress
,
saw
that
a
very
few
minutes
more
would
bring
the
tree
inwhich
he
was
,
under
the
aim
of
the
man
with
the
gun
.
<EOS>
Bang
went
the
piece
again
,
and
another
flight
of
screaming
birds
flewfrom
the
tree
fired
at
,
and
along
with
a
number
of
crows
took
refuge
inthe
one
occupied
by
Gray
.
<EOS>
The
men
were
now
within
a
few
paces
of
thetree
,
and
he
could
hear
in
his
elevated
position
with
painfuldistinctness
every
word
they
said
.
<EOS>
By
a
great
effort
,
he
in
a
great
measure
stilled
the
trembling
whichwould
have
betrayed
him
,
and
lay
along
a
thick
branch
nearly
breathlessfrom
terror
.
<EOS>
“You
may
depend
he
’s
off
,
”
said
the
man
with
the
gun
.
<EOS>
“
He
would
n’t
waitfor
you
.
”“Unless
<EOS>
he
’s
drowned
himself
,
”
remarked
the
other
,
who
was
thebill
-
sticker
.
<EOS>
“No
<EOS>
fear
of
that
,
”
remarked
the
other
with
a
laugh
,
“
these
kind
offellows
never
cheat
the
hangman
that
way
.
<EOS>
He
has
had
time
to
run
acrossthe
field
to
Highgate
or
Hampstead
,
or
even
to
skulk
into
town
you
maydepend
.
<EOS>
”“Well
<EOS>
,
I
’d
take
my
oath
<EOS>
it
was
him
as
was
mentioned
in
the
bill
,
”
saidthe
man
who
had
brought
all
this
danger
upon
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
I
was
thankful
Igot
off
scot
-
free
from
him
,
I
can
tell
you
.
<EOS>
He
would
soon
have
blown
mybrains
out
if
I
had
said
half
a
word
.
”“Oh
,
bother
you
,
”
cried
the
other
,
“
<EOS>
you
were
too
fainthearted
,
you
meanto
lay
hold
of
him
.
”“It
<EOS>
’s
<EOS>
all
very
well
for
you
to
talk
with
a
gun
in
your
hand
,
but
whatodds
was
I
with
a
paste
-
pot
against
a
right
down
regular
murderer
,
Ishould
like
to
know?”“Upon
my
faith
,
”
said
he
with
the
gun
,
<EOS>
“
I
should
have
enjoyed
seeingyou
sneak
off
—
I
really
should
.
<EOS>
”As
<EOS>
he
spoke
,
he
commenced
reloading
his
gun
with
deliberation
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
whata
horrible
process
that
was
to
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
Each
moment
gave
him
a
pangof
fear
that
nearly
stopped
the
beating
of
his
heart
.
<EOS>
How
he
watchedthe
action
of
the
ramrod
as
the
powder
was
pressed
down
.
<EOS>
Then
therattle
of
a
number
of
small
shot
as
they
went
down
the
barrel
,
cameupon
his
ears
with
dreadful
distinctness
.
<EOS>
Again
there
was
a
piece
ofpaper
pressed
into
the
muzzle
of
the
piece
,
and
as
the
ramrod
forced
ithome
with
a
dull
sound
upon
the
charge
,
Jacob
Gray
perspired
in
everypore
,
and
with
difficulty
kept
himself
from
shrieking
,
mercy
!
<EOS>
Mercy!“That
’s
an
old
tree
,
”
remarked
the
man
,
as
he
primed
the
gun
,
andstepping
back
a
pace
or
two
levelled
it
among
the
branches
.
<EOS>
“
Irecollect
it
when
I
was
a
boy
.
<EOS>
”“Fire
<EOS>
away
,
”
said
the
other
,
who
seemed
quite
to
enjoy
the
sport
.
<EOS>
“Now
—
now
,
”
thought
Jacob
,
“
now
to
fall
a
bleeding
wounded
man
to
theground
—
now
for
pain
,
horror
,
capture
,
death
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
closed
his
eyes
,
and
clung
to
the
branch
on
which
he
lay
with
puredesperation
.
<EOS>
All
thought
of
a
consistent
character
became
lost
inabject
terror
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
him
an
age
ere
the
man
fired
into
the
tree
.
<EOS>
Then
suddenly
a
loud
report
reached
his
ears
.
<EOS>
Small
branches
of
thetree
fell
about
him
,
and
he
uttered
a
deep
groan
,
as
he
felt
a
shockupon
his
face
,
and
along
one
arm
,
which
assured
him
he
had
been
hit
bysome
of
the
shots
.
<EOS>
The
pain
of
a
gun
-
shot
wound
is
not
immediate
;
thefirst
effect
is
rather
as
if
sensation
had
been
suddenly
stunned
,
butwhen
the
shock
subsides
,
and
the
blood
again
resumes
its
wontedchannels
,
the
agony
of
the
wound
commences
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
case
withJacob
Gray
,
and
although
but
very
few
of
the
shots
had
struck
him
inthe
face
,
the
neck
,
and
on
one
arm
,
he
could
have
screamed
with
pain
inthe
course
of
a
few
moments
,
and
it
required
all
the
counteractinginfluence
of
the
master
feeling
of
his
mind
—
fear
—
to
prevent
him
fromdiscovering
himself
.
<EOS>
Clinging
still
to
the
branch
desperately
heendured
the
pain
in
silence
for
he
durst
not
even
moan
.
<EOS>
His
first
groanhad
been
drowned
in
the
report
of
the

now
that
the
echoes
haddied
away
,
and
all
was
still
,
the
least
sound
of
pain
from
his
lipsmight
be
his
utter
destruction
.
<EOS>
The
men
were
silent
for
some
moments
after
the
discharge
of
thegun
—
then
he
who
had
fired
it
remarked
in
a
disaffected
tone,—“He
ai
n’t
there
.
<EOS>
It
’s
no
use
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
given
us
the

<EOS>
”“No
,
he
could
not
stand
that
<EOS>
,
I
’m
<EOS>
sure
I
could
n’t

”
said
thebill

,
“
I
never
saw
so
many
birds
fly
out
of
a
tree
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
”“That
<EOS>
’s
because
we
have
hunted
them
from
all
the
others
,
and
they
tookrefuge
in
this
one
blockhead
,
”
cried
the
man
with
the
gun
,
whose
temperdid
not
seem
at
all
improved
by
the
non
-
success
of
his
expedition
.
<EOS>
“Well
,
you
need
n’t
get
in
a
passion
,
”
suggested
the
other
.
<EOS>
“Who
<EOS>
’s
in
a
passion
?
<EOS>
How
do
you
know
I
’m
in
a

<EOS>
I
do
n’t

the

there
’s
an
end
of
it

<EOS>
”“Upon
<EOS>
my
conscience—”“Bother
your
conscience
—
you’ve
got
none
.
<EOS>
”“Why
,
now
you
saw
his
things
lying
by
the
side
of
the
pond
yourself
.
<EOS>
What
—
suppose
now
he
’s
drowned
himself
really
.
<EOS>
How
you
’d
look
then
.
<EOS>
Whydon’t
<EOS>
you
have
the
pond
dragged
<EOS>
—
you
know
nobody
will
drag
it
for
me
.
<EOS>
”“Why
<EOS>
do
n’t
you
get
in
and
feel
about
for
him
?
”
<EOS>
suggested
the
man
withthe
gun
.
<EOS>
“What?”“Get
into
the
pond
and
see
<EOS>
if
he
’s
there
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
”“And
put
my
foot
on
him
perhaps
.
<EOS>
I
’d
sooner
go
to
Jericho
.
<EOS>
I
shouldnever
recover
it

<EOS>
Suppose
I
was
to
go
in

put
my

<EOS>
Oh

oh!”“You
are
a
coward
,
<EOS>
that
’s
what
you

you

hunt
the

for

<EOS>
”“Don’t
go
away

”
cried
the
bill

.
<EOS>
“
Why
—
why—”“I
sha
n’t
stay
here
to
be
fooled
any

”
said
the

.
<EOS>
“Will
<EOS>
you
lend
me
the
gun
,
then?”“Lend
you
my
gun?”“Yes
.
<EOS>
”“I’ll
<EOS>
see
<EOS>
you
particularly
well
—
never
mind
.
<EOS>
”So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
of
the
gun
marched
off
in
very
great
dudgeon
,
leaving
thebill

sticker
gazing
after
him
.
<EOS>
“Well
<EOS>
,
”
he
muttered
,
“
there
’s
an
air
and
a
grace
,
I
never
knew

<EOS>
I
<EOS>
—
I
think
I
’ll
have
a

for

myself

—
yet
he
might
master
me

and
I
think
I

<EOS>
It
’s
all
very
well
totake
a
prisoner
,
but
when
the
prisoner
takes
you

it
ai
n’t
near
sopleasant

<EOS>
”Having
<EOS>
come
to
this
sage
conclusion
,
the
bill
-
sticker
rapidly
walkedaway
,
glancing
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
around
him
in
terror
,
lest
Grayshould
make
a
sudden
dart
at
him
from
behind
some
tree
or
hedge
.

“Here

Jacob

smeared

“

a
Little
Anatomy
.
<EOS>
While
all
these
important
circumstances
are
taking
place
,
intoxicationwas
doing
its
fell
work
upon
even
the
iron
frame
of
Andrew
Britton
,
andeach
day
saw
him
more
coarse
,
bloated
,
and
wayward
in
his
variousfancies
.
<EOS>
He
was
but
as
an
infant
in
the
interval
between
his
fits
ofdrunkenness
,
and
it
was
never
until
he
had
taken
enough
ardent
spiritsto
kill
any
ordinary
person
that
he
felt
his
energies
increase
and
hisblood
course
through
his
veins
with
its
accustomed
activity
.
<EOS>
Thefearful
excitement
of
drink
was
deluding
him
with
its
present
support
,
at
the
same
time
it
was
sapping
the
very
springs
of
his
life
,
andweakening
the
foundations
of
his
strength
.
<EOS>
He
had
already
expended
a
small
fortune
at
the
Chequers
,
and
yet
hisgold
,
to
the
surprise
of
the
landlord
and
the
frequenters
of
the
house
,
appeared
to
be
inexhaustible
.
<EOS>
Endless
were
the
conjectures
of
who
andwhat
he
was
;
and
one
person
had
actually
called
upon
Sir
FrancisHartleton
to
mention
his
strong
suspicions
that
all
was
not
right
asregarded
Britton
;
but
we
know
that
the
magistrate
had
ample
andjudicious
reasons
for
not
alarming
Learmont
by
a
useless
interferencewith
Andrew
Britton
;
and
although
he
received
the
communication
withpoliteness
,
he
replied
that
he
saw
no
reason
at
present
to
take
anysteps
as
regarded
the
drunken
smith
,
who
held
his
nightly
orgies
at
theChequers
;
so
that
the
party
left
his
office
rather
discouraged
thanotherwise
,
and
Britton
pursued
his
career
unchecked
.
<EOS>
On
the
very
night
which
had
witnessed
the
denunciation
of
Jacob
Gray
byAda
at
Whitehall
,
and
the
various
harrowing
incidents
,
directly
and
,
indirectly
arising
therefrom
,
Britton
had
been
holding
high
revel
inthe
parlour
of
the
Chequers
.
<EOS>
He
had
that
morning
visited
Learmont
,
and
was
now
freely
lavishingaround
him
the
gold
pieces
,
which
appeared
to
have
no
limit
,
but
to
beproduced
by
him
as
freely
as
if
he
had
discovered
the
much
covetedsecret
of
the
transmutation
of
metals
.
<EOS>
There
was
one
man
who
lately
Britton
had
taken
much
to
,
and
that
was
onaccount
principally
of
his
wonderful
capacity
for
drink
,
in
which
hevied
with
the
smith
himself
.
<EOS>
This
man
was
a
butcher
,
residing
in
theimmediate
vicinity
,
and
in
every
respect
he
was
indeed
a
fit
companionfor
Britton
.
<EOS>
Brutal
,
coarse
,
strong
,
and
big
<EOS>
,
he
combined
in
himselfall
that
Britton
admired
;
and
as
he
had
no
money
,
and
Britton
hadplenty
,
which
he
was
,
moreover
,
willing
to
spend
freely
,
they
becamequite
great
cronies
and
friends
.
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
Britton
and
the
butcher
,
whose
name
was
Bond
,
occupiedtwo
seats
near
the
fire
-
place
,
and
were
indulging
in
a
bowl
of
hotarrack
punch
,
which
steamed
before
them
,
and
from
which
they
dippedlarge
quantities
with
pewter
measures
.
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
room
presented
its
usual
mostly
appearance
.
<EOS>
There
werepersons
of
all
kinds
and
conditions
below
,
the
respectable
,
and
a
steamof
hot
breaths
,
vapour
of
mixed
liquors
,
and
all
sorts
of
villanouscompounds
,
to
which
was
added
copious
volumes
of
tobacco
smoke
,
whichascended
to
the
roof
.
<EOS>
All
was
boisterous
,
rough
mirth
and
roaring
jollity
,
the
onlydistinguishing
feature
of
which
was
that
Britton
took
care
his
voiceshould
be
heard
above
all
the
surrounding
din
,
and
if
any
one
presumedto
laugh
as
loud
as
he
,
or
raise
his
voice
to
as
stentorian
<EOS>
a
pitch
,
heeither
commissioned
the
butcher
,
or
went
himself
,
to
nob
the
saidperson
on
the
head
with
the
pewter
measure
.
<EOS>
Britton
was
in
one
of
histreating
humours
,
and
he
had
just
ordered
jugs
of
strong
ale
all
roundwhen
<EOS>
the
landlord
came
in
and
said,—“Gentlemen
all
,
there
’s
some
rare
news
—
most
rare
news!”“What
is
it
?
”
<EOS>
cried
a
dozen
voices
in
chorus
.
<EOS>
“Hilloa
!
”
<EOS>
roared
Britton
.
<EOS>
“
Peace
,
I
say
,
peace
!
<EOS>
Am
I
king
or
not?Damme
,
if
I
was
a
cockchafer
instead
of
a
king
,
you
could
n’t
behaveworse
;
curse
you
all!”“Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
A
cockchafer
,
”
laughed
a
man
whose
back
was
towardsBritton
,
but
who
was
just
within
his
reach
,
and
he
accordingly
receivedfrom
Britton
<EOS>
such
a
stunning
blow
with
the
pewter
measure
that
he
hadnot
a
laugh
in
him
for
an
hour
.
<EOS>
“Now
,
silence
all
,
”
cried
Britton
,
and
when
comparative
stillness
wasprocured
,
he
turned
with
drunken
gravity
to
the
landlord
,
and
said.—“Now
<EOS>
,
idiot
,
you
come
into
my
presence
,
and
say,—‘There
’s
news!’”“Yes
,
your
majesty
.
<EOS>
”“If
<EOS>
you
interrupt
me
,
I
’ll
brain
you
.
<EOS>
No
,
not
brain
you
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n’t
bebrained
,
having
none
;
but
I
’ll
do
something
else
that
I
’ll
think
of
.
<EOS>
Now
,
what
’s
the
news?”“May
it
please
your
majesty
,
”
said
the
landlord
,
“
there
’s
<EOS>
news
of
afire
and
a
murder
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
smith
half
rose
from
his
chair
and
his
face
assumed
a
tinge
of
deepred
as
he
<EOS>
shouted,—“Who
dare
say
so
much
?
<EOS>
Think
you
<EOS>
I
am
crippled
and
can
not
use
my
forehammer
still
—
<EOS>
the
—
the
fire
was
accidental
.
<EOS>
”A
<EOS>
murmur
of
astonishment
passed
among
those
present
,
and
the
landlordadded,—“I
—
I
—
was
only
told
of
it
,
your
majesty
,
and
thought
you
’d
like
to
hear
,
that
’s
all
.
<EOS>
No
offence
,
your
majesty
,
only
they
say
that
there
’s
been
amurder
,
and
the
old
place
where
it
was
done
burnt
down
to
destroy
thedead
body
.
”“Liar
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Britton
,
making
a
rush
at
the
landlord
.
<EOS>
“
Who
—
who
dare
sayhalf
as
much
?
<EOS>
Show
me
the
man
,
and
I
’ll
take
his
life
!
<EOS>
Show
his
face
,
and
then
I
shall
find
his
throat!”Everybody
rose
,
and
the
landlord
made
good
his
retreat
to
the
door
,
where
he
stood
looking
at
Britton
aghast
,
for
he
had
never
seen
him
inso
genuine
a
rage
before
.
<EOS>
“What
<EOS>
do
you
mean
,
”
growled
the
butcher
,
“
by
coming
here
and
vexinghim
?
<EOS>
Slaughter
me
if
you
deserve
such
a
customer
.
<EOS>
Hands
off
there
,
leave
him
alone
,
will
you?”“It
’s
a
lie
,
”
cried
Britton
;
“
there
is
nobody
there
to
burn
,
none
—
none

<EOS>
That
woman
,
that
hag
,
Maud
,
has
trumped
up
the
tale

<EOS>
She
is
mad

quite
full

the
smith
—
Beware

<EOS>
I
say!”The
<EOS>
veins
upon
his
forehead
were
swollen
almost
to
bursting
,
and
rageimparted
to
his
voice
a
vehemence
which
soon
destroyed
it
,
for
his
lastwords
were
hoarse
and
broken
,
and
still
muttering
only—“Beware

”
<EOS>
hesuffered
the
butcher
to
lead
him
back
to
his
seat
and
fill
for
him
ameasure
of
the
hot
punch
,
which
Britton
drank
as
if
it
had
been
so
muchwater
.
<EOS>
Then
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
exclaimed,—“The

villain

come
to
me
with
such
a

<EOS>
His

should
be
worth
more
to
him
than
to
risk
it

<EOS>
”“Be
calm
!
”
<EOS>
said
the
butcher
,
in
a
voice
that
almost
shook
the
raftersof
the
house
.
<EOS>
“
Be
calm
;
give
care
the

There

Now
I
’m

is
in

I
’ll

<EOS>
”Britton
was
quiet
for
a
few
moments
,
partly
from
exhaustion
and
partlybecause
he
was
nearly
choked
with
another
measure
of
punch
which
hethrew
into
his
throat
rather
heedlessly
,
and
the
landlord
,
when
thebutcher
had
done
speaking
,
took
the
opportunity
of
throwing
in
a
wordof
personal
justification
,
for
he
was
quite
alarmed
at
the
riot
he
hadcreated
,
as
he
supposed
,
with
such
very
slender
materials
.
<EOS>
“Your
majesty
,
”
he
said
,
“
will
humbly
excuse
me
,
but
there
is
a
fire

there
’s

”“At

freely

everyglass

tankard
was
filled
to
do
honour
to
the
proposition
ofBritton
,
when
the
landlord
,
whose
back
was
against
the
door
,
was
nearlypushed
down
by
the
sudden
entrance
of
a
man

who
,
after
one
glanceround
the

cried,—“Now

the
words

arose
two

from

nodded
tohim

had
just
arrived

What
the
three
were
about
to
do
seemedinvolved
in
mystery

likely
to
form
an
endless
theme
forconjecture

for
before
they
could
make
any

another
man
appeared
at

nearly
breathlessfrom

cried
in

loud
voice,—“No!”The
two
men
who
had
risen
looked
at
each
other
in
amazement
,
and
thenat
the
stranger
,
who
cried
,
“
No
!
”
<EOS>
in
a
tone
of
such
authority
.
<EOS>
For
thespace
of
about
a
minute
no
one
spoke
,
and
a
general
feeling
of
alarmseemed
to
be
produced
by
this
strange
proceedings
,
a
clue
to
which
noone
could
possibly
imagine
.
<EOS>
Then
he
who
had
last
made
his
appearance
said
,
in
a
lower
tone,—“You
know
me?”“Yes
,
sir
,
”
replied
both
the
men
in
a
breath
.
<EOS>
“Enough
—
<EOS>
follow!”He
then
turned
on
his
heels
and
walked
away
.
<EOS>
The
two
men
as
well
as
hewho
had
just
come
in
so
mysteriously
made
a
bustle
to
leave
the
room
,
but
by
this
time
all
the
indignation
of
King
Britton
was
thoroughlyaroused
,
and
he
roared
<EOS>
out,—“This
is
pretty
;
I
’ll
let
you
know
who
is
king
here
.
<EOS>
You
follow
him
ifyou
dare
,
ye
hounds
.
<EOS>
What
’s
the
meaning
of
all
this?”He
rose
from
his
seat
and
sprung
to
the
door
as
he
spoke
,
but
he
had
nosooner
got
there
that
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
the
man
<EOS>
whohad
cried
“
No
”
so
lustily
,
and
who
hearing
some
objections
made
to
hisorders
,
had
come
back
.
<EOS>
There
was
an
unflinching
boldness
about
the
man
,
that
for
a
moment
staggered
Britton
,
and
they
stood
face
to
face
for
afew
moments
in
silence
.
<EOS>
“Well
,
bully
,
”
cried
the
man
,
“
what
now?”The
<EOS>
only
reply
of
the
smith
was
a
straightforward
blow
,
which
was
,
however
,
so
skillfully
parried
by
the
stranger
,
that
it
was
not
onlyquite
innoxious
to
him
,
but
gave
Britton
a
severe
wrench
of
the
elbow
.
<EOS>
“What
now
?
”
<EOS>
again
cried
the
man
.
<EOS>
“Let
<EOS>
me
get
at
him
,
”
roared
the
butcher
.
<EOS>
“No
,
”
screamed
Britton
.
<EOS>
“
D
—
e
,
let
him
have
fair
play
.
<EOS>
It
’s
my
quarrel
,
and
I
’ll
smash
anybody
that
interferes
.
<EOS>
”All
now
rose
,
and
a
more
strange
collection
of
excited
faces
couldscarcely
have
been
seen
,
than
was
presented
just
then
at
the
Chequersin
expectation
of
a
serious
battle
between
the
smith
and
hisantagonist
,
who
,
although
not
near
so
stout
a
man
,
was
fully
as
tall
,
and
a
great
deal
younger
looking
than
he
.
<EOS>
“What
<EOS>
do
you
want
here
?
”
said
Britton
.
<EOS>
“I
shall
not
tell
you
,
”
replied
the
man
.
<EOS>
“You
can
fight?”“A
little
.
”“Where
<EOS>
I
came
from
,
”
added
Britton
,
“
we
wrestle
a
little
.
<EOS>
”“So
<EOS>
do
we
where
I
came
from
,
”
replied
the
other
,
calmly
.
<EOS>
“Do
<EOS>
you
,
”
cried
Britton
,
and
then
confident
in
his
own
strength
andskill
,
even
half
intoxicated
as
he
was
,
he
sprung
upon
the
man
,
andseizing
him
fairly
by
the
shoulder
and
waist
,
he
made
a
tremendouseffort
to
throw
him
,
but
he
produced
no
more
impression
upon
thestranger
than
as
if
he
had
laid
hold
of
the
corner
of
a
house
.
<EOS>
After
a
few
moments
’
exertion
,
he
ceased
,
panting
,
from
his
endeavours
,
and
at
that
moment
the
stranger
put
out
his
arms
,
and
threw
Britton
soheavily
upon
his
back
that
the
room
shook
again
.
<EOS>
“Foul
play
!
<EOS>
Foul
play
!
”
<EOS>
cried
the
butcher
,
half
rising
.
<EOS>
“You
lie
,
sir
,
”
cried
the
stranger
,
in
a
tone
that
made
the
butcherfall
back
into
his
seat
again
with
surprise
.
<EOS>
“Follow
,
”
cried
the
stranger
then
,
addressing
the
men
who
had
waitedpatiently
until
the
result
of
the
combat
.
<EOS>
He
then
strode
from
thehouse
,
being
immediately
followed
by
those
who
appeared
to
know
him
,
and
under
so
implicit
an
obedience
to
his
commands
.
<EOS>
Britton
was
pickedup
by
the
butcher
,
and
laid
with
a
thwack
as
if
he
had
been
some
hugejoint
of
meat
,
upon
one
of
the
oaken
tables
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
hope
there
<EOS>
’s
no
bones
broke
,
”
said
the
landlord
.
<EOS>
“Bones
broke
,
be
bothered
,
”
replied
the
butcher
;
“
I
think
I
ought
toknow
something
about
bones
and
meat
too
.
<EOS>
”“So
<EOS>
you
ought
.
<EOS>
Master
Bond
,
”
cried
a
man
;
“
so
you
ought
.
<EOS>
Only
I
shouldsay
you
knew
most
about
bones
.
<EOS>
”“Should
<EOS>
you
,
spooney
—
and
why?”“Because
<EOS>
you
never
send
me
a
joint
that
is
n’t
at
least
the
best
partbones
.
<EOS>
”There
was
a
general
laugh
against
the
butcher
at
this
<EOS>
sally
,
who
,
glaring
ferociously
at
the
speaker
,
exclaimed,—“When
<EOS>
you
come
to
my
shop
again
,
look
after
your
own
carcass
that’sall
,
and
now
for
what
I
calls
judgmatical
atomy
.
<EOS>
”“What
?
”
cried
several
voices
.
<EOS>
“Judgmatical
atomy
,
”
roared
the
butcher
.
<EOS>
“
It
means
knowing
whetherbones
is
broke
or
not
.
”“Oh
,
very
good
,
Master
Bond
,
”
said
the
landlord
.
<EOS>
“
Pray
attend
to
hismajesty
,
bless
him
.
<EOS>
I
hope
he
ai
n’t
hurt
—
a
d
—
d
fool
.
<EOS>
”This
<EOS>
last
sentence
was
uttered
very
low
by
the
landlord
,
and
Bond
,
thebutcher
,
at
once
commenced
a
ludicrous
examination
of
the
various
limbsof
Britton
.
<EOS>
“He
<EOS>
ai
n’t
hurt
in
the
fore
-
leg
,
”
he
remarked
.
<EOS>
“
He
ai
n’t
damaged

<EOS>
He
’d
cut
up
as
nice
as
possible

and
nobody
be
nowiser
.
<EOS>
Pour
a
glass
of
brandy
into
his
mouth
,
and
hold
his
nose
.
<EOS>
”This
<EOS>
operation
was
duly
performed
,
and
as
recovery
or
strangulationwere
the
only
alternatives
nature
had
,
in
the
case
of
Andrew
Britton
,
she
embraced
the
former
and
he
opened
his
eyes

CHAPTER
LXV.An
Interview
with
a
Secretary
of
State.—Sir
Francis
Hartleton’sDifficulties
.
<EOS>
In
order
to
explain
the
cause
of
the
singular
interruption
whichoccurred
to
the
festive
scene
at
the
Chequers
,
we
must
glance
at
theproceedings
of
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
for
the
preceding
two
days
.
<EOS>
We
have
before
hinted
at
the
very
awkward
position
in
which
Sir
FrancisHartleton
was
placed
as
a
magistrate
,
having
suspicions
of
the
verystrongest
mature
for
suspecting
some
foul
crime
on
the
parts
ofLearmont
,
Andrew
Britton
,
and
the
man
Gray
,
of
whose
existence
andidentification
with
the
third
in
the
iniquitous
proceeding
he
had
onlylately
had
good
reason
to
believe
,
and
yet
such
suspicions
not
assuminga
sufficiently
tangible
form
to
enable
him
to
found
a
charge
upon
him
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
working
as
he
was
in
the
dark
in
trying
to
unravel
aplot
the
intricacies
of
which
seemed
to
him
to
increase
instead
ofdiminish
as
he
dived
into
it
,
he
never
knew
but
what
some
false
step
ofhis
—
some
effort
of
over
-
zeal
might
put
the
guilty
parties
not
only
ontheir
guard
of
him
particularly
,
but
might
set
them
to
work
to
takemore
effectual
steps
than
they
had
hitherto
done
for
the
suppression
ofevery
particle
of
tangible
evidence
against
them
,
but
might
likewiseinduce
deeper
and
blacker
crimes
than
any
they
had
yet
attempted
orcommitted
for
the
preservation
of
secrets
essential
to
their
existence
.
<EOS>
Thus
it
was
that
although
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
had
a
strong
perceptionof
the
main
facts
of
the
case
he
had
in
hand
as
regarded
the
guilt
ofLearmont
,
yet
he
felt
that
he
could
not
be
too
cautious
in
what
he
saidor
did
consequent
thereon
,
until
some
circumstance
should
arise
to
givea
direct
clue
to
such
a
chain
of
evidence
as
should
enable
him
at
onceto
pounce
upon
them
all
,
and
insure
their
condemnation
on
irrefragibleproofs
.
<EOS>
After
his
first
interview
with
Albert
Seyton
,
he
had
carefully
made
anarrative
of
all
the
circumstances
connected
with
the
affair
,
and
as
itwill
be
recollected
that
by
that
interview
,
he
was
enabled
to
placetogether
the
names
of
Gray
,
Britton
,
and
Learmont
,
in
such
a
manner
asto
be
certain
that
they
were
then
,
or
had
been
,
engaged
in
some
greatact
of
villany
together
,
he
was
in
a
much
better
situation
for
arrivingat
a
correct
conclusion
with
regard
to
the
various
circumstances
<EOS>
thatcame
crowding
upon
his
recollection
.
<EOS>
That
some
crime
,
most
probably
a
murder
,
had
been
committed
so
manyyears
ago
when
he
,
a
young
man
,
having
more
passion
and
impetuositythan
discretion
,
resided
in
the
village
of
Learmont
on
the
night
of
thefire
at
the
Old
Smithy
,
he
never
entertained
a
doubt
,
and
theprobability
that
had
he
been
a
private
individual
and
not
an
open
enemyas
<EOS>
it
were
of
Learmont
<EOS>
’s
,
he
would
have
made
some
effort
of
perhaps
ahazardous
and
illegal
nature
to
obtain
satisfaction
on
the
affair
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
,
however
,
was
one
of
those
who
felt
deeply
theresponsibilities
of
the
situation
in
which
he
was
placed
as
one
of
theministers
of
justice
,
and
he
would
have
considered
himself
as
quiteunfit
for
so
onerous
<EOS>
an
office
had
he
acted
from
impulse
instead
ofreflection
in
the
prosecution
of
evil
-
doers
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
although
ferrettingthe
while
,
he
waited
until
something
should
occur
to
point
him
a
clearand
consistent
path
in
the
investigation
.
<EOS>
His
own
suspicions
were
simply
these
.
<EOS>
That
Learmont
had
,
by
theassistance
of
the
savage
smith
and
the
man
who
had
rushed
from
theburning
house
with
the
child
,
committed
some
great
crime
for
the
sakeeither
of
stilling
for
ever
some
evidence
of
preceding
criminality
,
orfor
some
then
present
gains
or
pecuniary
advantage
,
and
hence
AndrewBritton
’s
<EOS>
constant
visits
to
Learmont
were
for
probable
claims
upon
hispurse
.
<EOS>
That
Jacob
Gray
was
the
man
who
had
so
rushed
from
the
burning
smithy
,
and
that
Ada
was
the
child
he
had
in
his
arms
,
Sir
Francis
,
after
whatwas
related
to
him
by
Albert
Seyton
,
felt
almost
assured
of
,
and
thatboth
Gray
and
Britton
were
now
preying
upon
Learmont
,
he
felt
convinced
.
<EOS>
All
this
,
however
,
did
not
amount
to
much
,
and
although
greatlystrengthening
his
own
previous
suspicions
of
foul
play
somewhere
,
afforded
him
no
information
as
a
magistrate
.
<EOS>
He
could
make
no
specificcharge
against
Learmont
.
<EOS>
He
had
nothing
to
say
to
Britton
,
and
Gray
hehad
never
been
able
to
catch
hold
of
,
or
he
would
have
made
an
attemptto
possess
himself
of
the
papers
addressed
to
him
,
which
he
thoughtmore
than
probably
contained
ample
information
.
<EOS>
He
was
likewise
moved
strongly
by
the
picture
Albert
Seyton
had
drawnof
the
persecutions
endured
by
Ada
,
and
setting
apart
all
otherconsiderations
,
he
was
most
anxious
to
rescue
her
from
the
ills
bywhich
she
was
surrounded
.
<EOS>
Thus
he
wanted
to
discover
two
things
principally
.
<EOS>
The
one
was
whatcrime
had
been
committed
at
the
Old
Smithy
;
and
the
other
was
,
presuming
Ada
to
be
the
child
seen
on
that
memorable
occasion
—
who
wasshe?To
neither
of
these
questions
could
he
give
himself
a
rational
answer
,
and
he
was
therefore
forced
to
endeavour
to
comfort
himself
in
theaffair
by
setting
a
watch
over
Britton
,
another
on
Learmont
,
and
makingwhat
exertions
he
could
himself
to
ferret
out
the
abode
of
Jacob
Gray
,
without
exciting
the
suspicions
of
Learmont
.
<EOS>
Several
times
the
thought
of
an
active
search
in
the
ruins
of
the
OldSmithy
at
Learmont
had
suggested
itself
to
his
mind
,
but
had
beenrejected
upon
the
conviction
that
such
a
proceeding
would
be
verypublic
,
and
could
not
be
undertaken
by
him
as
a
magistrate
,
withoutsome
valid
previous
excuse
.
<EOS>
On
the
day
,
however
,
that
he
considered
himself
so
fortunate
as
to
haveunearthed
Jacob
Gray
,
and
to
have
him
all
but
in
his
grasp
,
Sir
FrancisHartleton
resolved
to
bring
affairs
to
some
sort
of
crisis
,
and
adoptreluctantly
the
only
plan
that
presented
itself
to
him
,
of
securing
thesafety
of
Ada
and
the
punishment
of
two
out
of
three
criminals
,
andthat
was
to
arrest
Britton
on
that
day
,
and
,
confronting
him
with
Gray
,
induce
a
clear
confession
from
one
or
the
other
of
them
,
under
apromise
of
relief
from
capital
punishment
.
<EOS>
He
,
acting
upon
this
feeling
,
procured
ample
assistance
,
and
previousto
starting
for
Gray
’s
house
in
the
marshes
of
Battersea
<EOS>
,
he
instructedone
of
his
experienced
officers
to
make
sure
of
the
rapture
of
Brittonbefore
night
.
<EOS>
His
disappointment
at
Forest
’s
house
<EOS>
we
are
aware
of
,
and
immediatelyupon
his
return
,
he
was
careful
to
countermand
the
order
for
Britton’sarrest
.
<EOS>
This
countermand
,
however
,
was
given
to
an
officer
who
wasseriously
hurt
in
a
common
street
affray
before
he
could
communicatehis
message
to
him
who
had
the
particular
charge
to
capture
the
smith
.
<EOS>
Hence
it
arose
that
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
was
not
aware
that
measureswere
taking
to
apprehend
Britton
,
until
it
was
almost
too
late
toprevent
it
.
<EOS>
He
,
nevertheless
,
made
the
attempt
,
and
was
as
we
haveseen
,
just
in
time
personally
to
stop
the
arrest
,
for
it
was
he
himselfwho
cried
“
No
!
”
<EOS>
in
the
parlour
of
the
Chequers
,
being
this
timeeffectually
disguised
from
the
observation
of
Britton
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
then
immediately
returned
to
his
own
house
,
where
he
hadnot
long
been
,
when
he
heard
rapidly
,
one
after
the
other
,
of
the
twoastounding
events
of
the
fire
at
the
lone
house
by
Battersea
,
and
thedenunciation
of
a
man
,
by
a
young
and
beautiful
girl
,
near
CharingCross
,
as
a
murderer
.
<EOS>
The
thought
immediately
flashed
across
his
mind
that
this
man
must
beJacob
Gray
,
and
his
accuser
the
persecuted
Ada
.
<EOS>
A
very
short
time
,
aswe
are
aware
,
convinced
him
that
his
suspicions
were
well
-
founded
,
andhis
main
cause
of
anxiety
being
removed
,
he
now
resolved
to
lend
allhis
energies
to
discover
who
Ada
was
,
and
bring
home
the
crimes
ofLearmont
and
his
associates
to
them
.
<EOS>
The
whole
affair
had
now
assumed
so
new
and
troublesome
an
aspect
,
thatSir
Francis
Hartleton
thought
it
necessary
to
apply
to
the
Secretary
ofState
for
sanction
to
the
proceedings
he
might
wish
to
adopt
.
<EOS>
His
wish
was
that
the
pursuit
after
Jacob
Gray
might
not
be
active
,
butthat
he
should
be
rather
left
alone
for
a
time
,
under
a
strictsurveillance
,
to
see
what
he
would
do
,
and
how
far
he
might
commit
hisassociates
by
visits
and
communication
with
them
.
<EOS>
He
likewise
wishedthe
case
of
Andrew
Britton
to
be
entirely
left
in
his
hands
,
for
theviolent
proceedings
of
the
savage
smith
had
begun
to
excite
theattention
of
others
of
the
local
authorities
,
and
he
,
Sir
FrancisHartleton
,
was
fearful
that
some
imprudent
step
might
be
taken
by
someother
magistrate
concerning
Britton
and
his
mysterious
wealth
,
whichmight
alarm
<EOS>
Learmont
before
he
wished
him
to
be
at
all
alarmed
.
<EOS>
With
these
views
and
feelings
,
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
repaired
to
theSecretary
of
State
,
with
whom
he
had
an
immediate
interview
,
and
towhom
he
carefully
detailed
all
the
circumstances
which
were
within
hisknowledge
,
concerning
Ada
and
her
fortunes
,
from
the
night
of
the
fireat
the
Old
Smithy
at
Learmont
,
to
the
time
when
she
had
taken
refuge
athis
house
,
concluding
by
saying,—“Sir
,
I
have
,
from
a
record
of
all
the
circumstances
,
the
strongestreason
to
believe
that
this
young
girl
is
the
same
,
who
,
when
aninfant
,
was
carried
from
the
burning
ruins
by
the
blood
-
stainedshrieking
man
,
but
still
I
have
no
proof
;
I
believe
that
Jacob
Gray
isthat
man
,
but
still
I
have
no
proof
;
I
believe
that
a
murder
wascommitted
that
night
at
the
smithy
,
but
still
I
have
no
proof
;
andmoreover
,
by
Gray
’s
subsequent
crimes
<EOS>
,
we
are
now
entirely
cut
off
fromoffering
him
any
merciful
consideration
for
a
full
and
free
confessionof
the
whole
of
the
circumstances
,
and
Britton
<EOS>
,
I
fear
,
is
not
the
manto
confess
at
all
;
if
he
were
,
he
is
most
probably
awfully
and
deeplyimplicated
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
what
I
wish
of
you
,
sir
,
is
authority
to
stopproceedings
against
Gray
,
for
the
present
,
and
to
leave
him
at
largeuntil
<EOS>
I
procure
some
more
tangible
information
concerning
all
thesemysteries
,
always
promising
that
I
can
arrest
him
at
any
time
I
please
.
<EOS>
”“Upon
<EOS>
my
word
,
”
said
the
secretary
,
scratching
his
chin
,
“
it
’s
a
verydisagreeable
and
awkward
affair
.
<EOS>
This
Learmont
has
promised
us
no
lessthan
seven
votes
in
the
Commons
.
<EOS>
”“Has
he
,
sir?”“Yes
,
and
<EOS>
you
see
—
really
seven
votes
—
are
—
are
—
in
point
of

<EOS>
”“He
<EOS>
procures
them
of

by
nominating
members
of
his
properties?”“Yes
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
”“Then
<EOS>
,
sir
,
should
all
that
property
be
wrested
from
him
by
aconviction
for
felony
,
those
votes
and
qualifications
must
revert
tothe
crown

<EOS>
”“Upon
<EOS>
my
word
that
’s
true
<EOS>
;
I
dare
say
he
’s
a
very
great
rogue
;
don’tmake
a
disturbance
for
nothing
,
Sir
Francis
,
but
you
can
take
theauthority
you
require
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
the
votes
are
more
useful
to
us
<EOS>
inour
hands
than
coming
through
his
;
but
<EOS>
the
family
may
not
be
extinct
.
”“Still
,
sir
,
we
can
not
smother
this
affair
;
justice
must
be
done
.
<EOS>
”“Of
course
,
I
know
all
that
;
the
majesty
of
justice
must
be
upheld;only
,
you
see
,
seven
votes
are
something
,
and
I
only
mentioned
howawkward
it
is
—
I
may
say
confoundedly
awkward
—
for

scarcely

<EOS>
’s
Visit
to
Learmont.—The
<EOS>
Disappointment.—A
Week
of
Terror.—TheStreet
Newsvender
.
<EOS>
Evening
was
casting
its
broad
shadows
across
the
Hampstead
fields
,
andthe
air
was
varied
with
the
songs
of
thousands
of
birds
retiring
toroost
,
when
Jacob
Gray
with
pain
and
difficulty
began
his
descent
fromthe
tree
which
had
afforded
him
so
hazardous
and
painful
<EOS>
a
refuge
forso
many
hours
.
<EOS>
Stiffened
and
benumbed
as
he
was
in
every
limb
,
he
found
it
no
easymatter
to
crawl
down
from
his
high
perch
;
and
it
was
only
after
manyminutes
of
uneasiness
and
terror
that
he
at
last
reached
the
ground;then
he
leaned
against
the
trunk
of
the
tree
,
and
with
dizzy
eyes
and
abewildered
brain
looked
anxiously
around
him
.
<EOS>
A
death
-
like
silencereigned
around
,
broken
by
nothing
but
the
twittering
of
the
sparrows
,
and
the
occasional
chirp
of
a
grasshopper
.
<EOS>
He
put
his
hand
up
to
hiswounded
face
,
but
the
blood
had
ceased
to
flow
,
and
he
only
now
felt
aheavy
,
deadening
sensation
about
the
region
of
his
wounds
.
<EOS>
After
a
timethen
,
he
ventured
to
leave
the
tree
,
and
with
a
slow
,
uncertain
andtottering
step
he
walked
towards
the
pond
.
<EOS>
The
direful
pangs
of
hunger
,
which
in
his
recumbent
position
in
thetree
had
not
greatly
afflicted
him
,
now
began
to
make
themselves
feltin
earnest
,
and
Jacob
Gray
groaned
in
his
agony
.
<EOS>
“Oh
,
”
he
cried
,
“
for
a
crust
—
the
hardest
morsel
that
ever
a
daintybeggar
cast
from
him
as
unworthy
of
his
wallet
—
I
shall
die
of
hungerere
<EOS>
I
reach
Westminster!”Still
he
tottered
on
towards
the
pond
,
and
when
he
reached
its
grassybrink
,
he
lay
down
as
he
had
done
before
,
and
drank
largely
at
theclear
water
.
<EOS>
Then
he
bathed
his
face
,
and
washed
away
partially
the
stains
of
bloodthat
had
hardened
into
coagulated
masses
upon
his
cheeks
;
and
he
wasagain
somewhat
refreshed
,
although
still
terribly
faint
from
want
ofsustenance
.
<EOS>
To
abate
,
if
possible
,
the
aching
,
racking
pains
in
all
his
limbs
,
hestrove
to
increase
his
rate
of
walking
,
but
that
expedient
,
byincreasing
the
languid
circulation
of
his
half
-
thickened
blood
,
causedhis
wounds
from
the
shot
to
burst
out
bleeding
afresh
,
and
the
horriblefaintness
that
came
over
him
for
want
of
food
made
him
reel
along
likea
drunken
man
.
<EOS>
It
might
have
been
the
lingering
effects
of
the
opiate
that
had
been
sofreely
administered
to
him
,
or
it
might
be
his
huge
draughts
of
waterupon
an
empty
stomach
,
but
,
from
whatever
cause
<EOS>
it
arose
,
a
deadlysickness
came
over
him
just
as
he
neared
some
cottages
at
the
base
ofthe
hill
,
leading
to
what
is
now
a
pretty
collection
of
suburbancottages
,
which
was
then
a
swampy
hollow
,
with
a
few
miserable
huts
,
occupied
by
people
who
sold
bundles
of
dry
sticks
for
firewoodostensibly
,
but
who
were
in
reality
had
characters
,
not
averse
toanything
,
so
that
it
promised
the
smallest
gain
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
held
with
a
shivering
,
nervous
grasp
by
one
of
the
palingswhich
divided
the
patch
of
garden
ground
belonging
to
one
of
thesehovels
from
the
waste
common
,
and
was
dreadfully
sick
—
sick
until
whatlittle
strength
had
been
left
to
him
was
frustrated
,
and
he
fell
,
abreathing
,
but
scarcely
animate
mass
,
by
the
side
of
the
palings
.
<EOS>
His
situation
was
an
unfavourable
one
for
attracting
the
attention
ofany
person
who
might
be
in
the
hut
,
for
the
palings
hid
him
,
and
he
hadnot
strength
,
had
he
the
inclination
,
to
cry
for
help
.
<EOS>
How
long
heremained
there
he
knew
not
,
but
it
was
quite
dark
,
when
,
the
awfulsickness
having
subsided
,
he
made
an
effort
to
rise
again
.
<EOS>
With
muchdifficulty
he
gained
his
feet
,
and
the
moment
he
did
,
the
horriblefeeling
of
hunger
—
maddening
hunger
—
came
across
him
with
twice
itsformer
intensity
of
pain
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
—
I
can
go
no
further
,
”
he
gasped
.
<EOS>
“
I
shall
die
on
the
road
side
if
Iattempt
to
reach
London
from
here
with
—
without
food
,
I
—
I
cannot
—
cannot
.
”He
<EOS>
staggered
along
the
palings
till
he
came
to
a
wide
gate
which
had
nofastening
,
and
there
,
with
a
feeling
of
desperation
,
he
crawledthrough
,
determined
to
risk
all
by
craving
charity
of
the
cottagers
.
<EOS>
As
he
went
on
by
the
inner
-
side
of
the
wide
palings
,
which
he
wasobliged
to
cling
to
for
support
,
he
struck
against
some
projectionwhich
threw
him
down
and
very
much
bruised
his
knee
.
<EOS>
As
he
lay
there
heput
up
his
hands
,
to
feel
what
it
was
,
and
by
the
shape
of
theprojection
,
as
well
as
dipping
his
hand
into
its
contents
,
he
thoughtin
a
moment
what
it
was
,
and
he
rose
with
alacrity
to
eat
greedily
froma
pig
-
trough
the
loathsome
remainder
of
the
last
meal
that
had
beengiven
to
the
swine
.
<EOS>
What
will
hunger
not
induce
persons
to
do
?
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
thought
he
hadnever
so
much
enjoyed
a
meal
in
his
life
,
and
when
he
had
devoured
theremnants
of
the
mash
in
the
trough
,
he
sat
down
by
the
palings
,
and
inabout
half
an
hour
was
sufficiently
recovered
to
make
his
project
ofproceeding
to
the
house
of
Learmont
at
Westminster
not
so
wild
andimpracticable
.
<EOS>
The
night
was
now
fairly
set
in
,
and
there
was
not
much
chance
<EOS>
ofGray
’s
ragged
,
wounded
,
and
emaciated
appearance
attracting
the
noticeof
any
one
along
the
dimly
lighted
road
from
Hampstead
to
London
.
<EOS>
Although
his
strength
was
now
a
little
restored
,
he
still
felt
very
illat
every
step
of
his
progress
,
and
his
only
hope
became
entirelyfounded
upon
the
chance
of
finding
Learmont
within
,
and
inducing
in
hima
belief
that
his
(
Gray
’s
)
strange
and
disordered
appearance
arosemerely
from
some
accident
on
his
road
,
and
not
from
any
circumstanceswhich
had
put
it
out
of
his
power
to
be
half
so
noxious
and
dangerousas
he
had
been
.
<EOS>
“Oh
,
”
he
thought
,
“
if
when
I
see
Learmont
he
did
not
know
how
harmlessto
him
I
am
without
Ada
—
without
a
written
scrap
to
leave
behind
me
,
topoint
the
finger
of
suspicion
against
him
—
how
his
fingers
would
closeupon
my
throat
and
<EOS>
what
music
to
his
ears
would
be
my
death
rattle
.
<EOS>
ButI
must
deceive
him
—
I
must
beard
him
still
—
still
defy
—
still
taunt
him
.
<EOS>
”It
<EOS>
was
some
hours
before
Jacob
Gray
,
travelling
at
the
unsteady
pace
hedid
,
contrived
to
reach
the
first
houses
in
London
;
and
when
he
did
so
,
what
would
he
had
not
given
for
but
one
of
the
pieces
of
bright
gold
hehad
been
so
long
hoarding
,
and
of
which
he
had
been
robbed
so
speedily
,
in
order
that
he
might
,
ere
he
adventured
to
see
Learmont
,
take
somemeans
of
improving
his
appearance
,
and
nourishing
his
wearied
frame
,
inorder
that
a
suspicion
might
not
arise
in
the
breast
of
the
craftysquire
that
all
was
not
as
usual
with
him
.
<EOS>
Then
there
was
another
view
of
his
condition
,
that
when
it
occurred
tohis
mind
,
brought
a
tumult
of
distracting
thoughts
into
the
brain
ofJacob
Gray
;
and
that
view
was
based
upon
the
uncertainty
that
beset
himwith
regard
to
<EOS>
Ada
’s
actions
since
denouncing
him
at
Whitehall
.
<EOS>
Had
shegone
to
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
’s
,
and
so
far
added
to
his
suspicions
ofLearmont
,
as
to
have
induced
some
step
against
the
squire
;
or
,
had
shemade
<EOS>
her
name
and
story
so
public
that
the
whole
of
Westminster
hadrung
with
it
,
coupled
with
the
fact
,
that
it
was
he
,
Jacob
Gray
,
whohad
been
hunted
up
the
Strand
;
and
that
Learmont
,
residing
as
he
did
,
within
almost
a
stone
’s
throw
of
the
whole
occurrence
,
heard
sufficientto
let
him
know
how
innoxious
Jacob
Gray
now
probably
was
in
his
death
,
and
how
impolitic
it
had
now
become
to
let
him
live
again
to
surroundhimself
with
those
precautions
which
had
been
so
suddenly
and
sostrangely
torn
from
him
in
the
course
of
a
few
short
hours
.
<EOS>
Whenever
all
this
occurred
to
Jacob
Gray
,
his
steps
faltered
,
and
theperspiration
of
mortal
fear
broke
out
upon
his
brow
,
for
he
knew
notbut
that
he
was
hurrying
to
his
destruction
,
and
making
powerfulefforts
to
be
earlier
at
the
place
in
which
he
was
to
be
sacrificed
.
<EOS>
Still
,
what
other
hope
had
that
miserable
guilty
man
.
<EOS>
Learmont
alonehad
the
power
to
aid
him
,
Learmont
alone
held
him
in
dread
,
and
mightstill
fancy
he
could
even
in
death
leave
a
sting
behind
him
which
mighttopple
him
from
his
haughty
height
of
power
,
and
dissipate
to
the
windsof
Heaven
all
his
dreams
of
wild
ambition
.
<EOS>
“Yes
,
yes
,
”
he
muttered
,
“
I
must
run
this
awful
risk
—
I
must
go
toLearmont
and
procure
enough
gold
for
my
present
necessaries
,
and
thenconcoct
some
scheme
for
the
dark
future
.
<EOS>
”With
<EOS>
a
face
as
pale
as
monumental
marble
<EOS>
,
save
where
a
few
livid
marksand
streaks
of
blood
showed
where
he
had
been
wounded
,
Jacob
Gray
nowturned
into
the
dense
mass
of
houses
about
St.
Giles
’s
,
for
the
purposeof
wending
his
way
as
quietly
and
as
far
from
the
public
thoroughfaresas
possible
towards
Charing
-
cross
.
<EOS>
Skulking
along
by
dark
places
,
and
shunning
anywhere
that
presented
alight
aspect
,
he
pursued
his
route
towards
the
upper
end
of
St
.
<EOS>
Martin
’s
lane
.
<EOS>
A
crowd
was
there
collected
sufficiently
dense
to
stophis
progress
,
and
he
dare
not
,
like
a
man
of
clear
conscience
and
openheart
,
push
his
way
through
the
motley
assemblage
.
<EOS>
In
vain
he
tried
toget
up
one
of
the
side
streets
which
would
not
take
him
far
out
of
hisway
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
recourse
but
to
go
back
some
hundred
yards
or
more
,
orendeavour
to
get
through
the
mass
of
persons
,
the
cause
of
whoseassembling
he
knew
not
nor
cared
,
so
that
they
would
let
him
passunobstructed
and
unquestioned
.
<EOS>
As
he
neared
,
in
his
efforts
to
pass
,
the
centre
of
the
throng
ofpersons
,
he
found
that
they
were
collected
around
a
man
who
was
,
in
theloud
conventional
voice
of
street
singers
and
proclaimers
of
news
,
attracting
his
auditors
by
some
narrative
of
deep
interest
,
apparently
.
<EOS>
In
another
moment
,
Gray
nearly
lost
all
power
of
motion
as
he
heardthese
words:—“Here
,
my
masters
,
you
have
a
full
account
with
all
the
particulars
ofthe
most
horrid
murder
in

Strand
of
Mr.
Vaughan
,
together
with
acopy
of
verses
made
on
the
occasion
,
and
addressed
to
all
youngpersons
,
warning
them
against

”The
<EOS>
man
then
in
a
loud
nasal
voice
,
commenced
his
verses
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
only
paused
to
hear
the
first
line
,
which
consisted
of
anappeal
to
young
mothers
nursing
tender
babes
,
and
then
unable
anylonger
to
remain
in

he
pushed
his
way
through
them
like

despite

he

succeeded

CHAPTER
<EOS>
LXVII.The
<EOS>
Disappointment.—The
Last
Resource.—A
Strange
Meeting.—TheConfession
.
<EOS>
The
clocks
were
striking
ten
as
Jacob
Gray
came
within
sight
ofLearmont
’s
house
,
and
then
so
strongly
did
all
his
former
fearsregarding
the
possible
results
of
his
interview
with
the
squire
<EOS>
cameacross
him
,
that
it
was
many
minutes
before
he
could
summon
<EOS>
courage
toascend
the
steps
of
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
There
was
,
however
,
no
other
course;and
,
<EOS>
although
his
fears
were
of
a
nature
rather
to
be
increased
thandiminished
,
by
the
feverish
nature
of
his
reflection
,
he
reluctantly
atlength
slunk
up
the
steps
and
knocked
at
the
door
,
for
at
that
hour
itwas
always
closed
.
<EOS>
The
few
moments
of
suspense
till
the
door
was
opened
were
agonising
toJacob
Gray
in
the
extreme
,
and
all
his
former
faintness
,
and
some
ofexhaustion
came
over
him
as
the
ponderous
portal
opened
,
and
a
servantstood
in
the
gap
and
demanded
his
business
.
<EOS>
“You
know
me
?
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
The
man
looked
at
him
doubtingly
,
for
what
with
his
wounds
,
and
thepain
,
misery
,
and
anxiety
,
he
had
gone
through
,
he
was
sufficientlyaltered
to
make
his
recognition
doubtful
for
a
moment
,
even
to
thosewho
had
seen
him
often
.
<EOS>
A
second
look
,
however
,
let
the
servant
knowthat
he
had
seen
him
before
as
one
of
his
master
’s
very
mysteriousvisitors
,
and
he
replied—“Yes
,
sir
<EOS>
,
I
do
know
you
.
”“Tell
<EOS>
your
master
I
am
here
.
<EOS>
”“He
is
not
within
.
<EOS>
”“Not
within,”“No
,
sir
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
expect
him
home
to
-
night
;
he
has
gone
to
a
party
atthe
Earl
of
Harrowdon
’s
,
in
the
Palace
-
yard
.
<EOS>
”Gray
stood
for
a
moment
leaning
for
support
against
the
door
-
post
—
thenby
a
strong
effort
he
spoke—“Thank
you
—
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
—
I
will
call
to
-
morrow
,
”
and
he
descended
the
stepsstupified
and
bewildered
by
the
cross
accidents
that
seemed
to
conspireagainst
him
.
<EOS>
He
heard
the
door
closed
behind
him
,
and
he
walked
on
mechanically
forabout
a
hundred
yards
,
when
he
sat
down
upon
the
step
of
a
door
,
andleaning
his
face
upon
his
hands
,
he
nearly
gave
himself
up
to
despair
.
<EOS>
“What
<EOS>
could
he
do?—What
resource
was
open
to
him?—Where
<EOS>
could
he
go
forfood
and
shelter
?
<EOS>
A
starving
fugitive!—With
a
price
set
upon
hiscapture
.
<EOS>
Could
there
be
yet
a
degree
of
horror
,
and
misery
beyond
whathe
now
endured?”“Yes
—
<EOS>
yes
,
”
he
suddenly
said
,
“
I
—
I
can
beg
.
<EOS>
Till
to
-
morrow
I
can
beg
afew
pence
to
save
me
from
absolute
starvation
;
but
,
yet
that
is
afearful
risk
,
for
by
so
doing
<EOS>
I
shall
challenge
the
attention
of
thepassers
by
,
instead
of
evading
it
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
starve
;
though
I
mustbeg
—
if
it
be
but
a
few
pence
to
keep
me
alive
until
the
morning
.
”Jacob
<EOS>
Gray
’s
appearance
was
certainly
very
much
in
favour
of
any
taleof
distress
he
might
relate
for
the
purpose
of
moving
the
charitable
topity
and
benevolence
.
<EOS>
A
more
miserable
and
woebegone
wretch
couldscarcely
have
been
found
within
the
bills
of
mortality
.
<EOS>
The
first
person
upon
whom
Jacob
Gray
made
an
attempt
in
the
beggingway
was
a
man
who
was
slowly
sauntering
past
,
enveloped
in
a
rich
andhandsome
coat
,
but
the
moment
he
heard
Gray
say,—“I
am
starving
,
”
he
drew
his
cloak
closer
around
him
,
as
if
by
so
doinghe
shut
out
his
appeal
to
humanity
,
and
hurried
on
at
a
rapid
pace
.
<EOS>
Gray
had
not
been
begging
long
enough
to
have
learnt
humility
,
and
thebitter
curses
he
muttered
after
the
man
with
the
cloak
would
have
madehis
hair
stand
on
end
,
had
he
have
heard
them
.
<EOS>
As
he
was
then
upon
the
point
of
rising
from
the
step
,
and
crawling
tosome
more
public
thoroughfare
,
in
which
he
might
have
a
more
extendedsphere
of
operation
,
a
strange
wild
noise
smote
his
ears
,
and
he
drewback
into
the
shadow
of
the
doorway
with
a
feeling
of
alarm
.
<EOS>
The
sound
seemed
to
approach
from
the
further
end
of
the
street
,
andnow
he
could
distinguish
a
voice
addressing
some
one
in
imploringtones
,
which
were
replied
to
by
a
harsh
voice
.
<EOS>
The
words
spoken
Graycould
not
distinguish
,
but
a
strange
presentiment
came
over
him
that
hewas
somehow
connected
with
the
persons
approaching
,
or
the
subjectmatter
of
their
discourse
.
<EOS>
Back
—
back
—
he
shrunk
into
the
doorway
,
until
he
was
completely
hidden
inthe
shadow
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
The
disputants
rapidly
approached
,
and
then
he
could
hear
the
roughervoice
exclaim,—“There
is
no
harm
meant
you
.
<EOS>
You
are
a
foolish
woman
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
overand
over
again
,
that
you
are
wanted
for
your
own
good
.
”“Murderer
,
away
,
away
!
”
<EOS>
cried
a
voice
that
struck
to
the
heart
of
JacobGray
,
for
he
knew
it
to
be
the
woman
he
had
seen
at
the
public
-
house
byVauxhall
,
when
he
ran
so
narrow
a
chance
of
capture
by
Sir
FrancisHartleton
.
<EOS>
“Will
<EOS>
you
come
quietly
?
”
<EOS>
cried
the
man
.
<EOS>
“No
—
<EOS>
no
—
not
with
you
,
”
cried
Maud
,
“
not
with
you
.
<EOS>
Look
at
your
hands
,
man
,
are
they
not
dyed
deeply
with
blood
?
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
You
shrink
now
.
<EOS>
No
—
<EOS>
no
—
Maud
will
not
go
with
you
;
but
I
will
tell
you
a
secret
.
<EOS>
Listen
—
<EOS>
do
you
know
Andrew
Britton
,
the
savage
smith?”“No
,
nor
do
n’t
want
,
”
said
the
man
.
<EOS>
“
Come
now
,
listen
to
reason
,
SirFrancis
Hartleton
wants
to
see
you
particularly
.
<EOS>
”“Aye
,
aye
!
”
<EOS>
said
Maud
,
“
that
’s
a
fine
device
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
where
the
childis
,
will
you?”“Come
now,—it
ai
n’t
far
,
”
said
the
man
.
<EOS>
“
Here
have
I
been
hunting
allover
London
for
you
nearly
a
day
and
half
now
,
and
when
I
find
you
,
youwon’t
come
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
Sir
Francis
means
to
do
something
for
you
.
<EOS>
”“Can
<EOS>
he
restore
the
dead?”“Not
exactly
.
”“Ah
!
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
He
can
—
he
can
.
<EOS>
So
now
I
know
you
are
no
messenger
of
his
.
<EOS>
You
come
from
Andrew
Britton,—why
?
<EOS>
To
kill
me
;
but
it
is
of
no
use
—
ofno
use
,
I
tell
you
.
<EOS>
You
,
and
he
,
and
<EOS>
everybody
know
well
that
he
is
todie
before
I
do
.
<EOS>
”Maud
<EOS>
now
laid
hold
of
the
rails
of
the
house
and
resolutely
refused
tomove
.
<EOS>
The
man
spoke
in
a
perplexed
tone
as
he
said,—“Come
—
come
now
,
do
n’t
be
foolish
.
<EOS>
I
must
get
some
help
to
take
you
,
whether
you
like
it
or
not
,
if
you
wo
n’t
come
now
quietly
.
”“Beware
,
”
said
Maud
.
<EOS>
The
man
gave
a
start
,
as
the
poor
creature
showed
him
the
glitteringblade
of
a
knife
she
had
concealed
in
her
bosom
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
pause
of
afew
minutes
,
and
then
Gray
heard
the
man
say,—“Very
well
.
<EOS>
Just
as
you
like
,
I
always
look
after
number
one
first
,
andI’ll
be
hanged
if
I
have
anything
more
to
do
with
you
.
<EOS>
”Maud
<EOS>
laughed
hysterically
as
she
sat
down
upon
the
step
,
and
still
kepta
clutch
upon
the
iron
rail
.
<EOS>
“Foiled
!
<EOS>
Foiled
!
”
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
“
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
Tell
him
it
is
in
vain
.
<EOS>
He
may
hunt
me
,
but
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
the
Eternal
,
thatBritton
,
the
savage
smith
of
Learmont
,
is
to
die
before
I.
Go
—
go
.
<EOS>
Ha!Ha
!
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
You
will
never
wash
the
blood
stains
out
.
<EOS>
Never
—
never
—
never!”The
man
made
no
answer
,
but
walked
away
at
a
very
rapid
pace
,
<EOS>
no
doubtfor
the
purpose
of
procuring
some
assistance
;
for
he
was
an
officer
whohad
been
ordered
by
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
to
seek
for
the
poor
desertedcreature
,
and
bring
her
to
him
,
when
he
would
take
measures
for
placingher
in
some
asylum
where
she
would
be
free
from
any
violence
on
thepart
of
Andrew
Britton
,
should
he
accidentally
meet
with
her
.
<EOS>
Maud
continued
to
mutter
in
a
low
tone
after
the
man
had
left
,
but
Graycould
not
closely
distinguish
what
she
said
,
and
he
remained
for
sometime
perfectly
quiet
,
resolving
in
his
mind
what
he
should
do
.
<EOS>
As
hecommuned
with
himself
the
deadly
spirit
of
revenge
against
all
whom
heimagined
to
be
in
any
way
accessary
to
producing
his
present
destitutestate
came
over
him
,
and
he
ground
his
teeth
as
he
muttered,—“I
could
kill
them
all
.
<EOS>
I
could
exult
in
their
agonies
.
<EOS>
I
will
,
I
musthave
revenge
.
<EOS>
This
hag
was
the
cursed
cause
of
all
the
horrors
I
havebeen
compelled
to
wade
through
,
and
shall
I
now
suffer
her
to
escape
,
now
that
she
is
in
my
power?”He
cast
a
rapid
glance
up
and
down
the
street
as
he
added,—“And
<EOS>
no
one
by
.
<EOS>
Oh
?
<EOS>
That
I
had
some
weapon
that
silently
and
surelywould
do
its
work
,
and
leave
her
here
a
corpse
.
<EOS>
She
shall
be
oneoffered
on
the
altar
of
my
revenge
!
<EOS>
I
must
,
I
will
work
the
destructionof
them
all
,
and
she
will
be
the
—
the
first
.
<EOS>
”A
<EOS>
deathly
languor
came
over
Jacob
Gray
even
as
he
spoke
,
and
he
groanedaudibly
.
<EOS>
Maud
started
at
the
sound
,
and
turning
she
fixed
her
eyes
upon
hisdusky
form
as
it
lay
hid
in
the
shadow
of
the
doorway
,
from
which
,
formore
than
a
minute
his
extreme
weakness
would
not
permit
him
to
move
.
<EOS>
“What
man
are
you
?
”
<EOS>
cried
Maud
.
<EOS>
“
You
groan
—
wherefore
?
<EOS>
Have
you
lost
allyou
<EOS>
loved?”“I
have
,
”
said
Gray
,
with
a
groan
,
as
he
thought
of
his
money
.
<EOS>
Maud
crept
up
the
steps
till
she
came
close
to
him
,
and
then
laying
hershrivelled
hand
upon
his
arm
<EOS>
,
she
said,—“I
know
you
now
—
I
know
you
.
<EOS>
”“Know
<EOS>
me
?
”
<EOS>
faltered
Gray
,
making
an
effort
to
pass
her
on
the
steps
.
<EOS>
“Yes
.
<EOS>
Where
,
and
how
,
and
when
we
meet
I
shall
soon
think
,
but
I
knowyou
.
<EOS>
”Gray
felt
a
little
alarmed
at
this
speech
,
and
he
replied,—“You
are
mistaken
,
I
am
poor
and
destitute
.
<EOS>
We
have
never
meet
before
.
<EOS>
”“Poor
<EOS>
and
destitute
?
<EOS>
Hast
ever
felt
the
pang
of
hunger
as
I
have?”“I
feel
them
now
.
<EOS>
”Maud
opened
a
wallet
she
had
with
her
,
and
took
some
broken
victualsfrom
it
,
which
she
laid
before
Gray
,
saying,—“Eat
—
eat
—
and
I
will
think
the
while
where
I
have
met
you
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
needed
no
second
invitation
,
but
devoured
the
not
very
temptingviands
before
him
,
with
an
eagerness
that
could
leave
no
doubt
of
thetruth
of
his
statement
concerning
his
hunger
.
<EOS>
Maud
passed
her
hands
several
times
across
her
brow
as
she
<EOS>
said,—“I
know
you
,
<EOS>
yet
I
know
you
not
.
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
hear
of
a
murder?”“No
,
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“Done
with
such
a
thing
as
this?”She
half
produced
the
knife
as
she
spoke
,
and
Gray
immediately
saidwith
eagerness,—“Give
<EOS>
me
that!”Maud
<EOS>
drew
back
,
and
fixed
her
wild
eye
upon
him
as
she
said,—“Are
you
a
man
of
blood
?
<EOS>
Let
me
see
your
hands
.
<EOS>
Are
they
stained
withinnocent
gore
,
or
free
from
the
damning
pollution
that
begrimes
thefool
,
and
drags
it
shrieking
to
despair
.
<EOS>
Answer
me
man
.
<EOS>
Saw
ye
ever
theOld
Smithy?”“Give
me
the
knife
and
I
will
tell
you
.
<EOS>
”“Yes
,
the
knife
!
<EOS>
He
is
eager
for
the
knife
,
who
knows
its
use
.
<EOS>
Answerme
:
saw
ye
the
fire
—
<EOS>
yes
,
the
fire
—
when
was
it
?
<EOS>
Yesternight?”“What
fire?”“In
a
house
where
dwelt
an
angel
<EOS>
,
I
knew
’
twas
that
—
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
Ha!And
<EOS>
there
was
a
body
too
<EOS>
that
would
not
burn
.
<EOS>
There
it
lay
black
andcold
,
untouched
amidst
the
charred
fragments
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
—
I
havebeen
there
to
look
for
the
angel
,
but
she
has
flown
up
to
her
nativeskies
,
with
not
a
downy
feather
of
her
radiant
wings
touched
by
thegross
element
.
<EOS>
”“You
,
you
have
been
to
the
house
?
”
<EOS>
stammered
Gray
.
<EOS>
“I
have
!
<EOS>
You
knew
it
?
<EOS>
It
lies
near
sweet
green
fields
,
and
the
merrybirds
mock
you
as
you
go
it
.
<EOS>
Listen
,
and
I
will
tell
you
what
I
did
.
<EOS>
The
early
dawn
was
brightening
,
and
old
and
young
with
jests
andlaughter
,
and
mingling
voices
,
went
to
see
the
ruins
of
the
ancienthouse
.
<EOS>
”“And
you
went?”“I
did
.
<EOS>
Then
some
bright
spades
and
hatchets
,
and
they
dug
for
the
bodyof
a
murdered

”Gray
<EOS>
clutched
to
the

he
said,—“Nonsense

her

upon

shrunk

”As
<EOS>
she
spoke
,
she
took
from
her
breast
a
small
torn
scrap
of
paper
andgazed
at
it
attentively
.
<EOS>
In
an
instant
Gray
surmised
the
truth
.
<EOS>
In
his
attempt
to
get
rid
of
hiswritten
confession
while
standing
on
the
ladder
,
previous
to
the
murderof
Elias
,
he
had
dropped
many
pieces
,
and
then
in
the
exciting
scenesthat
followed
utterly
forgotten
them
.
<EOS>
Once
indeed
,
while
in
the
tree
onHampstead
Heath
,
he
remembered
the
circumstance
,
but
then
heimmediately
assumed
that
they
had
been
burnt
along
with
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
now
trembled
in
every
limb
,
as
the
thought
came
over
him
,
thatpossibly
the
poor
mad
creature
might
have
collected
sufficient
of
thetorn
pieces
to
give
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
a
tangible
idea
of
the
whole;and
although
he
felt
that
,
next
thing
to
his
life
,
was
the
repossessionof
those
torn
scraps
,
he
was
so
overcome
by
the
circumstance
of
theirthus
coming
to
light
,
that
for
a
few
moments
he
thought
he
should
havefainted
.
<EOS>
Maud
,
meanwhile
spread
out
the
small
crumpled
pieces
of
paper
in
herhand
,
and
commenced
reading
in
a
low
muttering
voice
,
“

temptation”—“a

slowly
prepared
himself
for
action
.
<EOS>
He
cast
a
wary
eye
around
him
,

no

was
visible

<EOS>
Then
he
drew
himself
up
to
make
a
rush
uponMaud

when
he
heard
a
voice
some
distance
from
the
street
say
loudly,—“Faster

bounded
from

randown

LXVIII.Britton
and
<EOS>

SimilarResults.—Learmont
’s
Weakness
and
Fears.—The
Chair
.
<EOS>
Despite
the
apathy
endured
by
his
habitual
state
of
intoxication
,
Andrew
Britton
began
to
feel
some
vague
sort
of
apprehension
that
therewas
danger
at
hand
,
and
that
he
was
watched
by
parties
who
came
and
satdown
with
apparent
jollity
in
the
old
parlour
of
the
Chequers
.
<EOS>
When
once
this
idea
got
possession
of
his
mind
,
it
began
to
tormenthim
,
and
,
however
,
after
thinking
to
the
best
of
his
ability
over
thematter
,
he
determined
upon
consulting
with
Learmont
upon
the
subject
,
and
leaving
it
to
his
cooler
judgment
to
take
what
steps
he
thought
fitin
the
affair
.
<EOS>
According
to
this
resolve
he
sought
the
house
of
Learmont
,
where
hearrived
but
a
very
few
minutes
after
Albert
Seyton
had
left
,
anddemanded
,
with
his
usual
effrontery
,
an
interview
with
the
squire
.
<EOS>
Learmont
had
latterly
looked
upon
Andrew
with
mixed
feelings
of
dreadand
exultation
—
dread
that
he
might
drink
himself
to
death
some
day
andleave
behind
him
ample
written
evidence
to
convict
him
,
Learmont
,
ofheavy
crimes
—
and
exultation
that
all
the
money
the
savage
smith
wrungfrom
his
fears
was
converted
into
the
means
of
his
destruction
by
hishabit
of
habitual
intoxication
.
<EOS>
When
they
now
met
,
Learmont
forgot
for
a
moment
his
personal
danger
ineager
notice
of
the
trembling
hand
and
generally
decayed
state
of
thesmith
’s
once
hardy
frame
.
<EOS>
But
he
forgot
at
the
same
time
that
anxietyand
the
constant
gnawing
of
conscience
were
making
even
more
rapidravages
upon
his
own
constitution
than
the
utmost
stretch
ofintemperance
could
have
done
.
<EOS>
Britton
was
pale
,
and
in
some
degree
emaciated
;
but
Learmont
waspositively
ghastly
,
and
had
wasted
nearly
to
a
skeleton
.
<EOS>
“Well
<EOS>
,
”
said
Learmont
,
in
a
hollow
and
constrained
voice
,
“
you
come
,
asusual
,
for
more
money
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
”“Yes
,
”
said
Britton,—“I
<EOS>
do
n’t
mean
to
go
away
empty
-
handed
squire
,
youmay
take
your
oath
;
but
I
have
something
more
to
say
on
this
visit
.
<EOS>
”“Say
it
;
and
begone
!
<EOS>
I
—
I
—
am
busy
.
<EOS>
”“Are
you
?
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
will
be
busier
still
some
day
.
<EOS>
Do
you
happen
tobe
thirsty?”“No
!
”
said
Learmont
impatiently
.
<EOS>
“That
’s
a
pity
,
because
I
am
;
and
if
it
was
n’t
for
the
look
of
thething
,
drinking
by
one
’s
self
,
I
’d
have
a
glass
of
something
.
”“Andrew
<EOS>
—
Britton
,
”
said
Learmont
,
jerking
out
his
words
slowly
frombeneath
his
clenched
teeth
;
“
I
have
warned
you
more
than
once
beforenot
to
trifle
with
me
.
<EOS>
Your
errand
here
is
specific
;
you
come
for
themeans
of
carrying
on
a
life
of
mad
riot
and
intoxication
—
a
life
whichsome
of
these
days
may
lead
you
to
an
excess
which
will
plunge
you
,
andall
connected
with
you
,
in
one
common
ruin
.
<EOS>
”“Well
,
is
that
all?”“And
enough
,
”
cried
Learmont
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
“
Have
I
ever
resisted
yourdemands?”“No
.
<EOS>
”“Have
I
ever
limited
your
calls
upon
my
purse?”“No
;
but
how
d
—
<EOS>
d
moderate
<EOS>
I
’ve
been
—
<EOS>
think
of
that
.
<EOS>
”“But
—
<EOS>
but
Britton
—
there
was
a
time
when
you
were
not
deaf
to
all
reason;hear
<EOS>
me
now

<EOS>
”“You
can
not
complain
of
me
,
so
long
as
I
freely
administer
to
your
realand
fancied
wants
.
<EOS>
Wherefore
,
then
,
should
I
run
a
fearful
and
terriblerisk
daily
from
your
excesses
?
<EOS>
You
admit
—
you
must
admit
—
that
I
,
to
thevery
spirit
and
letter
,
fulfil
my
contract
with
you
;
and
yet
I
run
afearful
risk
—
a
risk
which
can
do
you
no
manner
of
good
.
<EOS>
What
,
if
youwere
to
die
,
Andrew
Britton
?
<EOS>
You
are
a
man
of
wild
excesses
;
I
say
,
ifyou
were
to
die
?
<EOS>
Is
the
end
of
all
my
compliances
with
your
demands
tobe
my
destruction
,
when
you
can
desire
no
more
?
<EOS>
Speak
!
<EOS>
How
do
youwarrant
me
against
so
hard
<EOS>
a
condition?”“I
do
n’t
warrant
you
at
all
,
”
said
Britton
.
<EOS>
“
Recollect
you
forced
me
toit
.
<EOS>
What
was
I
?
<EOS>
The
smith
of
Learmont
.
<EOS>
I
toiled
day
and
night
;
and
theycalled
me
‘
a
savage

and
why
?
<EOS>
because
I
was
in
your
toils
—
I
did
a
pieceof
work
for
you
<EOS>
that—”“Hush

Hush

<EOS>
gasped
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“Oh

What
was
my

toil

you
know

<EOS>
You
taunted
me
with
my
guilt

Once

squire

when
I
threw
in
your
teeth

that
the
same
halterthat
was
made
for
me
,
would
fit
your
worshipful
neck
,
you
told
me
thatI
flattered
myself
,
for
that
the
word
of
a
right
worshipful
squire
,
would
outweigh
the
oath
of
a
smith
,
and
cursed
me
for
a
fool
,
but
Ibelieved
you
,
and
put
up
with
it
,
till
that
sneaking
hound
,
Gray

cameto
me

”“Curses

<EOS>
muttered
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“Ha

Ha

<EOS>
laughed
Britton

<EOS>
“
I
like
him
no
more

to
lay
at

door

”“But
to
my
question
<EOS>

Britton

said
Learmont
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
“Well
,
to
your
question
—
what
care
I
what
becomes
of
you

<EOS>
I
have
myselfand
myself
only
to
look

Britton

may
carry
thismatter
so
far

I
may
turn
upon

find
greater
safety

once
determine

You
have
not

the
inclination

<EOS>
To
accomplishsuch
an
object

you
must
come
to

for
a
sum
of
money

which
would
beequivalent
to
proclaiming
your

at

thus
my

would
be
your
destruction

may

”He
<EOS>
dropped
into
a
chair
,
as
he
spoke
,
and
a
deadly
paleness
came
overhis
face
,
robbing
it
even
of
its
usual
sallowness
,
and
giving
instead
achalky
appearance
to
the
skin

that
was
fearful
to
behold

“There

Britton

“

<EOS>
”Learmont
<EOS>
leaned
heavily
upon
the
arm
of
the
smith

as
he
<EOS>
said,—“Good

shrunk
aghast

Britton

”“I’ll

swaggered
out

by

his

independence
to
Learmont

in

CHAPTER
LXIX.A
Walk
and
a
Meeting.—The
Vision
at
the
Open
Casement.—Learmont’sPerturbation
.
<EOS>
An
idea
had
struck
Learmont
,
during
the
course
of
his
conversation
withBritton
which
,
now
that
the
smith
was
gone
,
came
still
more
stronglyand
forcibly
across
his
mind
,
and
shaped
itself
into
clearer
words
.
<EOS>
“Why
<EOS>
should
not
I
,
”
he
said
,
“
if
I
find
that
in
England
there
is
for
menothing
but
danger
,
disgrace
,
and
constant
apprehension
,
why
should
notI
take
my
accumulated
wealth
somewhere
else
,
to
some
land
where
I
couldpurchase
with
it
dignity
and
power
,
and
—
what
is
more
freedom
from
theterrors
that
now
beset
my
path
?
’
<EOS>
Tis
worth
reflecting
on
such
a
course;I
could
do
it
most
easily
now
.
’
<EOS>
Tis
a
comforting
reflection
—
a
mostcomforting
reflection
,
and
—
<EOS>
and
when
I
am
tortured
by
doubts
and
fears
,
I
will
think
of
such
a
course
.
<EOS>
But
this
news
of
Britton
’s
troubles
me
.
<EOS>
He
thinks
himself
watched
by
Hartleton
;
why
doubtless
so
am
I.
SirFrancis
is
no
friend
to
me
,
and
would
gladly
find
me
tripping
some
ofthese
days
—
I
must
crush
him
—
I
will
have
his
life
,
if
it
cost
me
half
mywealth
.
<EOS>
We
kill
a
noxious
reptile
,
because
we
think
it
may
sting
us
;
sowill
I
have
vengeance
upon
you
,
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
because
I
knowyou
would
sting
me
if
you
could
.
<EOS>
I
must
find
some
means
subtle
,
deep
,
and
dangerous
to
him
,
but
withal
to
me
innoxious
.
<EOS>
I
must
kill
,
and
yetnot
seem
to
kill
,
even
to
the
instrument
with
which
I
do
the
work
.
<EOS>
Britton
<EOS>
it
is
of
no
use
attempting
to
employ
on
such
an
occasion
,
unless
I
could
be
certain
of
his
success
,
and
then
,
his
execution
forthe
deed
.
<EOS>
In
such
a
case
,
I
should
be
rid
of
two
enemies
;
and
evenBritton
would
not
be
so
wantonly
mischievous
as
to
deceive
me
,
at
nobenefit
to
himself;—yet
<EOS>
is
it
dangerous
.
<EOS>
I
must
think
again
.
<EOS>
MasterHartleton
—
you
are
playing
with
edged
tools
.
<EOS>
”Learmont
was
now
silent
for
a
time
,
and
then
rose
,
saying,—“Now
for
the
life
of
action
which
shall
drown
thought
—
my
wealth
—
myhouse
—
<EOS>
my
brilliant
entertainments
have
all
succeeded
so
far
as
to
makeme
a
honoured
guest
with
more
than
I
can
visit
—
but
I
will
visitmany,—it
—
it
is
time
I
began
to
enjoy
something
now
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
horrible
contortion
which
he
produced
upon
his
ghastly
face
,
by
wayof
a
smile
,
at
these
words
,
startled
him
,
as
he
saw
it
reflected
in
amirror
hanging
opposite
to
him
;
and
he
shook
in
every
limb
,
as
hehastily
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
His
servants
shrunk
from
before
him
as
,
in
about
ten
minutes
time
,
hepassed
down
the
great
marble
staircase
of
his
mansion
,
splendidlydressed
,
and
enveloped
in
a
cloak
,
to
make
some
calls
.
<EOS>
Declining
,
with
a
haughty
wave
of
his
hand
,
the
chair
that
stood
in
thehall
,
he
strode
out
;
and
,
with
his
lips
compressed
as
usual
with
him
,
so
closely
that
not
a
particle
of
blood
was
left
in
them
,
he
turnedinto
the
park
,
intending
to
call
upon
the
frivolous
but
noble
Breretonfamily
,
who
had
lodgings
near
to
old
Buckingham
House
.
<EOS>
Of
all
the
persons
intent
on
pleasure
,
on
business
,
or
on
intrigue
,
that
thronged
to
the
park
<EOS>
,
Learmont
fancied
that
no
one
could
carry
soheavy
a
heart
as
himself
,
and
yet
how
successful
had
he
been
!
<EOS>
Had
henot
accomplished
all
that
he
had
grasped
at
?
<EOS>
But
,
like
the
dog
in
thefable
,
what
a
valuable
and
tangible
possession
had
he
dropped
,
ingrasping
the
shadow
which
now
darkened
his
soul
.
<EOS>
He
saw
not
the
sunshine,—for
<EOS>
his
own
heart
was
black
and
gloomy
;
<EOS>
heheard
not
the
merry
song
of
the
birds,—for
busy
thought
was
conjuringup
direful
images
in
his
brain
.
<EOS>
He
strode
along
,
like
a
tall
spirit
—
abeing
belonging
to
some
more
gloomy
and
uncongenial
world
than
ours
,
who
heard
but
discord
in
our
sweetest
sounds
,
and
could
not
appreciateany
of
our
pleasures
.
<EOS>
And
yet
strange
to
say
,
all
that
Learmont
had
toiled
for
—
all
he
hadsinned
for
—
all
he
had
dipped
his
hands
in
blood
for
,
had
been
that
hemight
enjoy
,
in
greater
abundance
,
<EOS>
these
very
delights
and
pleasuresthat
seemed
to
mock
his
grasp
,
and
to
retreat
like
the
ignis
fatuus
ofthe
morass
—
far
off
in
proportion
,
as
he
most
wishes
to
approach
.
<EOS>
He
walked
up
the
principal
mall
,
and
none
addressed
him
,
although
manylooked
after
the
tall
,
gaunt
,
melancholy
-
looking
man
,
as
he
strode
insilence
onwards
.
<EOS>
What
would
Learmont
not
have
given
for
a
companion;one
who
would
feel
and
think
with
him
,
and
divide
the
weight
ofoppressive
conscience
.
<EOS>
A
lively
burst
of
martial
music
now
came
suddenly
upon
his
ears
,
and
heglanced
in
the
direction
from
whence
it
came
,
when
he
saw
a
personstanding
by
a
seat
,
from
which
he
seemed
to
have
just
risen
,
close
tohim
.
<EOS>
A
second
glance
told
Learmont
it
was
the
young
man
,
Albert
Seyton
,
who
had
applied
to
him
for
the
office
of
secretary
,
and
he
bowed
coldlyand
stiffly
to
him
,
which
Albert
courteously
rejoined
,
saying,—“The
morning
is
inviting
,
sir
.
<EOS>
”“Yes
—
<EOS>
a
—
cold
,
as
you
say
,
”
replied
Learmont
,
in
an
abstracted
tone
.
<EOS>
“Cold
,
sir?”“Fine
—
fine
,
I
mean
.
<EOS>
Did
I
say
cold?”“You
did
,
sir
;
but
probably
your
thoughts
were
somewhere
else
.
<EOS>
I
fear
Iintrude
upon
you
.
<EOS>
”“No
<EOS>
,
<EOS>
no
;
you
do
not
.
<EOS>
My
thoughts
,
young
sir
,
never
wander
,
but
I
amgrateful
to
him
who
can
bring
them
back
again
.
<EOS>
”“He
is
like
me
,
”
thought
Albert
,
with
a

”“Have
<EOS>
you

further
of
what
I
proposed
to
you
at
our

”
said
Learmont
.
<EOS>
After
a
long
pause
,
for
Albert
did
not
well
know
what
to
say
in
answerto
the
remark
last
made
by
the
melancholy
squire
,
“
I
have

sir

”
he
nowsaid
,
“
and
adhere
firmly
to
all
<EOS>
I
before
pledged
myself
to

that

I

<EOS>
”Albert
bowed
,
and
walked
by
the
side
of
his
strange
employer
in
silencefor
some
minutes
.
<EOS>
Learmont
<EOS>
then
said,—“You
will
call
upon
me
to
-
morrow
,
according
to
our
previousarrangement
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
shall
be
proud
to
do
so
,
”
said
Albert
.
<EOS>
“Well
<EOS>
,
well
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
man
may
be
there
;
but
beware
of
his
consummateart

young
sir

<EOS>
If
you
would
successfully
track
him

youmust
be
wary

cunning

patient

sagacious

believe
me
no

ever
succeed

circumventing
him

”“Indeed

<EOS>
”“Ay
<EOS>

indeed

you

<EOS>
He

Even
I
—

no

<EOS>
You
will
freely
undertake

<EOS>
Track

see

<EOS>
Then
mark

by
every

that
may
enable

to
lay

and
I

more

<EOS>
”“I
hope
I
may
,
”
said
Learmont
.
<EOS>
They
now
walked
along
the
Birdcage
-
walk
,
for
they
had
doubled
thecanal
,
and
were
approaching
towards
Westminister
again
.
<EOS>
For
the
spaceof
more
than
five
minutes
neither
spoke
,
for
both
were
busy
withreflections
,
although
of
a
widely
different
character
.
<EOS>
Albert
Seyton
was
more
and
more
suspicions
of
the
intentions
ofLearmont
,
and
he
began
to
think
him
a
man
,
most
probably
,
mixed
up
insome
dark
political
intrigues
,
to
carry
out
which
,
he
required
somesimple
and
unsuspecting
agent
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
very
galling
to
theproud
spirit
of
Albert
,
in
the
supposition
that
Learmont
had
pitchedupon
him
,
as
thinking
him
weak
enough
to
believe
anything
,
and
never
tosuspect
that
the
employment
he
was
set
upon
was
far
different
from
whatit
purported
to
be
,
and
he
longed
to
say
,
“
<EOS>
But
I
am
not
so
simple
andfoolish
as
you
may
imagine
me
,
and
have
my
doubts
,
and
grave
suspicionsconcerning
your
conduct
and
the
truth
of
words
;
”
but
then
he
could
notbring
himself
to
say
so
much
,
because
all
as
yet
was
merely
made
up
ofdoubt
and
suspicion
,
and
he
considered
how
ridiculously
foolish
hewould
look
by
allowing
his
imagination
to
run
riot
in
creatingapprehensions
,
perhaps
after
all
,
to
be
completely
dissipated
by
theresult
,
and
arising
only
,
possibly
,
from
his
young
and
uninstructedfancy
and
ignorance
of
the
ways
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
Albert
Seyton
,
therefore
,
prudently
determined
to
be
watchful
and
wary;but
to
take
nothing
on
surmise
,
and
to
believe
,
or
affect
to
believe
,
as
far
as
the
non
-
expression
of
doubt
went
,
all
that
Learmont
mightchoose
to
say
until
some
positive
and
glaring
fact
contradicted
him
.
<EOS>
While
these
thoughts
were
passing
through
Albert
’s
mind
,
Learmont
,
onthe
other
hand
,
was
congratulating
himself
upon
his
meeting
with
theyoung
man
,
and
extracting
from
the
whole
circumstance
food
for
moreagreeable
hope
and
reflection
than
had
illumined
his
gloomy
mind
for
along
previous
period
.
<EOS>
“Here
,
”
he
thought
,
“
there
is
at
last
a
chance
of
discovering
JacobGray
’s
place
of
abode
—
a
chance
too
,
which
if
it
fails
,
commits
me
to
noone
,
and
does
me
no
manner
of
injury
.
<EOS>
But
it
can
not
scarcely
fail
.
<EOS>
Thisyoung
man
and
<EOS>
he
being
perfect
strangers
might
,
in
such
a
city
asLondon
,
follow
each
other
about
for
a
week
without
exciting
suspicion
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
he
looks
upon
discovering
this
man
’s
abode
as
the
key
-
stoneof
his
future
favour
with
me
,
and
consequent
advancement
.
<EOS>
I
could
nothave
devised
a
better
plan
,
and
,
surely
,
fortune
must
have
beendesirous
of
favouring
me
when
she
sent
this
raw
young
man
to
solicitemployment
from
me
.
<EOS>
By
the
powers
of
hell
,
I
would
not
have
missed
sucha
chance
of
circumventing
that
demon
Gray
for
a
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
”Learmont
,
in
the
momentary
exultation
of
these
thoughts
suddenly
raisedhis
eyes
from
the
ground
,
on
which
they
had
been
bent
,
and
uttering
acry
of
terror
,
he
sprang
forward
several
yards
,
and
then
exclaimed,—“There
—
there
—
again
—
again
!
<EOS>
Is
it
ever
to
haunt
me
thus?”He
pointed
with
his
trembling
finger
to
the
windows
of
a
house
<EOS>
whichoverlooked
the
park
for
some
distance
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
casements
was
open
,
but
there
was
no
one
at
it
,
and
Albert
looked
first
at
Learmont
,
andthen
at
the
window
in
amazement
,
not
unmixed
with
a
sudden
thoughtthat
,
after
all
,
his
new
employer
might
be
a
madman
.
<EOS>
Learmont
continued
pointing
for
a
moment
towards
the
window
.
<EOS>
Then
heslowly
dropped
his
hand
,
and
in
a
low
agitated
voice
said
,
half
aloud,—“Could
<EOS>
it
be
<EOS>
fancy?”“What
saw
you
,
sir
?
”
said
Alberta
.
<EOS>
“Come
—
come
—
hither
.
<EOS>
”Albert
approached
close
to
him
,
when
he
leaned
heavily
on
the
arm
ofthe
young
man
,
and
said,—“You
were
walking
with
me
,
and
if
it
were
real
,
you
must
have
seen
it
.
<EOS>
”“Seen
<EOS>
what
,
sir?”“A
face
pass
for
an
instant
across
yon
window
.
<EOS>
”“That
<EOS>
now
open?”“Yes
—
the
sun
shines
upon
it
as
you
see
,
and
across
the
open
space
thereslowly
passed
a
face
.
<EOS>
You
saw
it?”“I
did
not
,
sir
.
<EOS>
”“You
are
sure?”“Quite
.
<EOS>
”“Then
<EOS>
fancy
must
be
torturing
me
.
’
<EOS>
Tis
very
strange
that
she
—
she
whom
Iscarce
think
of
should
be
the
vision
to
haunt
me
.
<EOS>
You
are
sure
you
sawno
one
pass
that
window?”“At
<EOS>
the
moment
my
eye
might
not
have
been
cast
in
that
direction
,
”
saidAlbert
“
<EOS>
but
certainly
I
saw
no
one
.
<EOS>
”“True
<EOS>
you
might
not
have
been
looking
;
but
neither
was
I
,
and
yet
myeyes
were
lifted
as
if
by
some
invisible
hand
,
and
then
I
saw
aface
—
that
—
that
—
I
fear
now
I
shall
often
conjure
up
.
<EOS>
”Learmont
<EOS>
leaned
against
the
railings
that
divided
the
entrance
from
theopen
thoroughfare
of
the
park
and
for
a
time
his
strength
appearedquite
prostrated
.
<EOS>
Albert
Seyton
continued
gazing
at
the
house
which
had
attracted
so
muchattention
from
Learmont
,
and
after
a
pause
of
some
minutes
’
duration
,
he
said,—“I
think
that
house
is
known
to
me
,
although
I
never
looked
at
it
fromhere
before
.
<EOS>
”Learmont
<EOS>
made
him
no
answer
,
for
although
he
heard
him
speak
,
hescarcely
comprehended
what
he
said
,
so
busy
was
he
with
his
own
fears
.
<EOS>
“If
<EOS>
I
mistake
not
,
”
said
Albert
,
“
it
is
the
back
of
Sir
FrancisHartleton
<EOS>
’s
house
we
see
from
here
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
name
of
Hartleton
struck
upon
Learmont
’s
ears
like
a
trumpet
,
andstarting
from
his
reverie
of
disagreeable
images
,
he
cried
hurriedly
,
and
violently,—“Who
spoke
of
Hartleton
?
<EOS>
Who
mentioned
his
name?”“I
,
sir
,
”
said
Albert
,
amazed
at
Learmont
’s
wild
vehemence
of
tone
.
<EOS>
“You
<EOS>
—
you?”“Yes
,
sir
.
”“Oh
,
you
have
heard
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
man
,
I
presume
,
known
to
many
.
<EOS>
Areyou
sure
that
is
the
back
of
his
house?”“Yes
<EOS>
,
now
I
look
again
<EOS>
I
am
quite
sure
;
I
know
it
by
some
peculiarchimnies

<EOS>
I
have
gazed
on

for
hours
with
a
hope
now
extinguished
forever
.
<EOS>
”“You
—
<EOS>
you?”“Yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
My
story
is
a
strange
one
;
I
have
lost
both
the
natural
andacquired
ties
that
bind
me
to
life
,
I
am
an
orphan
,
and
I
can
nevermore
behold
her
who
would
have
filled
the
void
in

<EOS>
”“But
<EOS>
you
speak
of

Hartleton
as

knew
him

<EOS>
Is
such
the
fact?”“I
am
scarcely
warranted
in
saying
so
much
,
”
replied
Albert
,
“
althoughI
have
seen
and
conversed
with
him
.
<EOS>
”“Indeed?”“Yes
<EOS>
;
and
he
gave
me
hopes
,
which
were
for
a
time
my
thoughts
by

my

my
hopes
which
I
clung

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
”“He
<EOS>
disappointed

did
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
could
not
do
otherwise
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
right
to
censurehim

but
he
could
not
know
how
my
heart
was
sinking
,
and
he
can
not
knowhow
it
has
been
wrecked
,
or
perhaps
he
would
have
done
more
or
tried
todo
more
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
querulous
upon
this
subject
,
and
may
blame
himcauselessly

<EOS>
It
is
a
fault
of

mistake

CHAPTER
LXX.The
Jew
and
the
Necklace.—Gray
’s
Troubles
and
Surmises.—An
Adventure
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
found
but
very
little
difficulty
in
gettingpossession
of
Ada
’s
necklace
from
the
Jew
,
who
had
made
so
capital
abargain
with
her
.
<EOS>
The
wily
Israelite
made
a
practice
of
neverpurchasing
an
article
unless
he
got
it
at
a
price
which
always
impliedthat
it
was
dishonestly
come
by
,
as
was
the
case
with
Ada
,
of
someparty
totally
ignorant
or
the
value
of
the
commodity
.
<EOS>
Another
rule
of
his
business
was
to
keep
his
greatest
bargains
someyears
,
if
he
thought
it
necessary
so
to
do
,
before
he
brought
them
intothe
market
,
so
that
if
the
jewel
or
the
gold
were
stolen
,
all
theexcitement
concerning
it
had
subsided
,
and
the
very
person
from
whomthe
property
had
been
filched
had
long
since
given
it
up
as
quitehopeless
.
<EOS>
In
this
manner
,
he
had
acted
with
regard
to
Ada
’s
necklace
,
which
wasreally
worth
a
much
larger
sum
than
either
Jacob
Gray
or
the
Jewimagined
,
for
the
former
knew
only
from
indirect
sources
the
value
ofthe
article
,
and
the
latter
rarely
came
across
anything
so
pure
andcostly
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
Jacob
Gray
had
a
strong
motive
for
preserving
the
necklace
,
because
,
as
we
know
,
he
always
looked
forward
to
a
day
when
it
might
benecessary
or
agreeable
to
him
to
declare
Ada
’s
name
,
birth
,
andlineage
;
and
thus
how
important
might
any
corroborative
evidence
becomeupon
the
subject
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
Jew
,
he
had
been
in
a
ceaseless
wonder
ever
since
he
hadpurchased
the
valuable
trinket
of
the
young
girl
,
and
in
vain
hepuzzled
himself
to
account
for
her
possession
of
it
,
and
form
some
ideaof
who
she
could
possibly
be
that
was
wandering
about
alone
with
suchvaluable
property
;
and
it
is
more
than
possible
that
his
great
bargainwas
as
great
a
source
of
disquiet
to
him
as
it
was
of
congratulation
,
for
he
reasoned
with
himself,—“If
sho
be
hash
<EOS>
she
had
such
a
necklace
,
and
did
n’t
know
fot
it
washworth
<EOS>
,
sho
help
me
,
she
might
have
had
something
else
petter
still
.
<EOS>
”This
was
a
sore
reflection
to
the
Jew
,
and
on
the
whole
afforded
a
finecommentary
upon
such
motives
as
his
who
rate
their
losses
by
theirgains
,
in
the
same
manner
as
the
man
who
found
half
-
a
-
guinea
,
and
uponbeing
told
that
two
had
been
lost
on
the
same
spot
sunk
the
fact
of
hisgood
fortune
in
finding
the
one
,
and
bemoaned
to
everybody
his
loss
ofthe
other
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
sore
blow
to
the
Jew
,
when
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
walked
intohis
shop
,
and
at
once
announcing
himself
as
the
much
dreaded
,
becauseactive
and
irreproachable
,
magistrate
,
demanded
the
necklace
,
giving
adescription
of
it
,
and
of
Ada
,
which
rendered
any
kind
of
shuffling
outof
the
matter
of
no
possible
use
.
<EOS>
The
necklace
was
therefore
produced
,
and
Sir
Francis
left
the
Jew
fullyimpressed
with
a
belief
that
he
would
immediately
be
prosecuted
,
although
such
a
step
was
still
far
from
the
magistrate
’s
intentions
,
who
,
as
we
are
aware
,
was
taking
every
means
he
could
to
keep
mattersquiet
,
and
awakening
no
public
curiosity
concerning
Ada
.
<EOS>
It
was
after
another
conversation
with
his
beautiful
young
guest
thathe
issued
an
order
to
find
poor
mad
Maud
,
intending
to
make
somepermanent
provision
for
her
benefit
,
not
at
all
expecting
that
shereally
possessed
sufficient
pieces
of
Jacob
Gray
’s
confession
to
enablehim
to
form
a
much
nearer
estimate
of
the
merits
and
demerits
of
thewhole
affair
,
than
he
had
hitherto
been
able
to
do
.
<EOS>
From
Ada
’s
description
of
Gray
,
he
was
now
enabled
to
set
a
watch
uponLearmont
,
who
,
from
all
the
circumstances
,
he
felt
certain
Gray
visitedto
get
money
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
’
object
now
was
to
give
Jacob
Gray
time
to
provide
himselfnot
only
with
means
,
but
to
fully
again
write
out
those
papers
hebelieved
would
unravel
every
mystery
connected
with
the
affair
.
<EOS>
That
Andrew
Britton
was
assailable
in
the
same
way
he
never
suspected
,
and
he
merely
waited
now
until
Gray
should
commit
both
Learmont
and
thesavage
smith
in
writing
to
take
some
active
step
in
the
business
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
little
imagined
that
he
was
quite
free
in
London
to
gowhither
his
fancy
might
lead
him
,
and
that
the
man
he
most
dreaded
,
namely
,
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
had
taken
a
great
deal
of
trouble
toprevent
his
arrest
.
<EOS>
Had
he
guessed
he
was
being
so
angled
with
,
his
terror
would
havekilled
him
;
but
as
he
sat
on
the
step
of
the
door
near
to
Learmont’s
,
he
concocted
in
his
mind
a
line
of
proceeding
,
<EOS>
which
,
but
for
variouscircumstances
he
could
not
know
of
,
might
have
been
successfullycarried
out
.
<EOS>
He
would
see
Learmont
in
the
morning
,
and
affecting
to
be
wearied
ofhis
present
line
of
life
,
to
offer
for
two
thousand
pounds
to
surrenderto
him
the
living
object
of
his
fears
,
as
well
as
his
,
Jacob
Gray’s
,
own
confession
,
and
leave
England
for
ever
.
<EOS>
Learmont
might
see
him
onboard
a
vessel
even
if
he
pleased
.
<EOS>
He
might
see
him
leave
the
shore
,
when
he
would
give
him
any
address
purporting
to
be
where
he
would
findAda
;
and
then
,
at
the
first
port
he
stopped
at
,
he
would
send
a
letterto
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
containing
sufficient
to
destroy
Britton
andLearmont
;
but
not
sufficient
to
be
of
any
service
to
the
persecuted
Ada
.
<EOS>
By
this
means
he
thought
to
gratify
his
revenge
against
them
all
;
and
,
at
least
,
secure
to
himself
safety
,
and
the
means
of
living
incomparative
luxury
in
some
cheap
continental
state
.
<EOS>
If
Learmont
should
refuse
such
a
compromise
,
he
could
adopt
some
othercourse
of
action
to
be
resolved
upon
after
his
next
interview
with
him;but
,
upon
the
necessity
of
leaving
England
,
and
that
quickly
too
,
hewas
quite
clear
and
decided
.
<EOS>
One
would
have
thought
that
Jacob
Gray
had
met
with
sufficientdisappointment
in
his
various
arrangements
to
dishearten
him
fromattempting
further
to
create
circumstances
,
and
philosophise
upon
theirresults
;
but
it
is
a
fixed
principle
in
those
natures
which
are
fond
toexcess
of
plotting
,
that
no
experience
will
deter
them
from
concoctingthe
hairbreadth
schemes
and
chances
which
would
,
combined
,
make
up
asatisfactory
result
,
but
which
all
possess
the
one
alarming
feature
,
that
the
whole
fabric
must
topple
down
upon
the
displacement
of
asingle
brick
.
<EOS>
He
rose
from
the
step
of
the
door
,
and
walked
onwards
,
he
knew
notwhither
,
for
some
time
;
but
,
at
length
,
he
found
himself
inParliament
-
street
,
from
the
immediate
vicinity
of
which
he
shrunkquickly
,
for
he
dreaded
the
glare
of
the
lights
,
and
feared
that
someone
might
recognise
him
as
the
fugitive
of
the
Strand
.
<EOS>
There
were
in
his
mind
some
strange
and
singular
contradictions
withregard
to
his
present
situation
,
<EOS>
which
,
as
calm
reflection
came
to
hisaid
,
he
found
it
very
difficult
indeed
to
reconcile
.
<EOS>
That
Ada
had
sought
refuge
with
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
he
couldscarcely
permit
himself
to
doubt
for
a
moment
;
but
then
theconsequences
which
she
had
always
dreaded
from
such
a
step
on
her
parthad
certainly
not
increased
so
rapidly
if
they
were
to
occur
at
all
,
ashe
would
have
sworn
they
would
.
<EOS>
He
anticipated
so
active
,
sopersevering
,
so
energetic
a
hunt
from
him
throughout
,
not
only
themetropolis
,
but
the
whole
kingdom
,
when
once
Ada
should
be
in
acondition
to
possess
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
of
the
events
of
the
fiveyears
of
her
life
with
him
,
Gray
,
that
safety
and
freedom
for
four
andtwenty
hours
was
a
thing
not
to
be
thought
of
;
and
yet
here
he
was
,
without
much
disguise
,
without
the
means
of
taking
that
care
to
avoidsuspicion
which
he
would
fain
have
done
,
free
and
unquestioned
hithertoin
the
public
streets
.
<EOS>
His
name
seemed
in
no
one
’s
mouth
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
hue
and
cry
—
<EOS>
no
bills
ofany
particular
moment
concerning
him
,
save
the
meagre
one
he
had
seenat
Hampstead
,
and
which
had
evidently
not
emanated
from
Sir
FrancisHartleton
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
the
affair
did
not
at
all
present
the
alarmingaspect
to
him
<EOS>
he
had
ever
expected
it
would
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
was
,
therefore
,
under
those
circumstances
thrown
back
uponseveral
suppositions
—
none
of
which
,
however
,
to
his
mind
bore
the
stampof
much
probability
.
<EOS>
One
was
that
Ada
had
not
taken
refuge
with
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
butby
<EOS>
some
means
had
fallen
into
other
hands
,
who
did
not
feel
sointerested
in
her
story
or
had
not
the
power
or
the
inclination
to
actupon
any
of
the
surmises
it
must
naturally
call
forth
.
<EOS>
Another
supposition
,
was
,
that
from
some
lingering
feeling
of
pitytowards
him
,
or
from
some
dark
and
haunting
suspicion
in
her
mind
<EOS>
thathe
might
be
related
to
her
,
she
had
,
although
with
Sir
Francis
,
abstained
from
committing
him
Gray
sufficiently
to
induce
a
hot
pursuitfor
him
,
on
other
grounds
than
the
murder
of
Elias
,
and
of
Vaughan
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
he
even
thought
it
possible
that
Ada
might
have
interceded
for
himto
be
left
alone
,
or
bargained
in
some
way
for
his
safety
.
<EOS>
But
as
oftenas
these
reflections
began
to
shed
some
comforting
influence
on
Gray
,
there
came
the
reflection
of
how
firmly
and
broadly
she
had
denouncedhim
as
a
murderer
in
the
public
streets
,
and
he
became
lost
again
in
awhirl
of
conflicting
thoughts
and
emotions
.
<EOS>
He
was
slowly
traversing
a
low
,
obscure
street
,
leading
fromGeorge
-
street
,
as
these
painful
thoughts
were
passing
through
his
mind
,
when
he
fancied
he
heard
a
footstep
behind
him
,
which
seemedaccommodating
itself
to
his
in
a
manner
that
excited
at
once
hissuspicion
that
he
was
watched
.
<EOS>
All
Gray
’s
dreams
of
securityimmediately
vanished
,
and
a
cold
perspiration
broke
out
upon
him
,
as
hefancied
he
was
upon
the
point
now
of
being
arrested
when
his
fate
wouldbe
certain
;
for
what
account
could
he
give
of
himself
that
would
not
atonce
strengthen
and
confirm
suspicion
.
<EOS>
He
still
heard
the
footstep
,
buthe
feared
to
look
behind
him
,
and
after
a
few
moments
of
confusedthought
he
resolved
to
try
a
simple
experiment
to
ascertain
if
he
werereally
followed
,
and
he
paused
suddenly
to
see
if
the
stranger
behindhim
would
pass
on
.
<EOS>
The
whole
mass
of
Jacob
Gray
’s
blood
appeared
to
him
to
curdle
in
hisreins
,
as
he
felt
sure
,
whoever
it
was
behind
him
,
had
stopped
likewise
.

Long

’s
Terror
.
<EOS>
The
little
strength
that
Jacob
Gray
had
left
now
all
at
once
seemedcompletely
to
have
left
him
,
and
he
trembled
so
that
he
could
scarcelystand
.
<EOS>
Walk
on
he
could
not
,
and
yet
what
was
he
to
do
?
<EOS>
Did
the
personknow
who
he
was
,
or
did
he
only
suspect
?
<EOS>
Was
there
a
remote
chance
ofescape
,
or
was
he
fairly
in
the
toils?As
<EOS>
these
distressing
thoughts
passed
rapidly
through
his
mind
,
he
heardthe
stranger
step
up
to
him
,
and
in
a
moment
,
a
voice
said
,
“
A
fineevening
,
sir
.
<EOS>
”Gray
stretched
out
his
hand
,
and
held
by
an
iron
rail
,
while
he
turnedslowly
and
with
pallid
features
,
and
his
tongue
cleaving
to
the
roof
ofhis
mouth
with
fright
,
faced
the
speaker
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
about
the
middle
height
,
with
sharp
small
grey
eyes
,
whichtwinkled
upon
the
terror
-
stricken
Jacob
as
much
as
to
say
,
“
I
am
acunning
,
cautious
fellow
,
and
you
wo
n’t
escape
me
.
<EOS>
”It
<EOS>
was
full
a
minute
before
Gray
could
command
himself
sufficiently
tospeak
,
and
the
stranger
during
that
time
had
repeated
his
remark
of,—“A
fine
evening
.
<EOS>
”“Yes
—
yes
,
very
,
”
stammered
Gray
.
<EOS>
“You
<EOS>
do
n’t
seem
very
well
,
sir
,
”
said
the
stranger
,
twinkling
his
eyesdesignedly
upon
Gray
.
<EOS>
“Yes
,
quite
well
,
thank
—
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
—
I
have
n’t
the
honour
of
knowing
you
.
<EOS>
Goodevening
—
<EOS>
good
evening
.
<EOS>
”“I
may
be
mistaken
,
”
said
the
man
;
“
<EOS>
but
I
think
I
have
seen
yousomewhere
.
<EOS>
”Gray
would
have
given
anything
at
that
moment
to
say
“
Where
?
”
<EOS>
but
helacked
the
courage
,
and
merely
muttered
something
about
it
<EOS>
beingunlikely
they
had
ever
met
,
as
he
was
a
stranger
in
London
.
<EOS>
The
man
kept
peering
at
him
in
a
very
disagreeable
manner
,
and
after
afew
moments
,
he
said
in
a
careless
tone,—“Heard
of
the
murder?”“What
murder
?
”
<EOS>
gasped
Gray
.
<EOS>
“In
<EOS>
the
Strand
—
Vaughan
’s
<EOS>
murder
I
mean
—
strange
affair
,
very!”“No
—
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
of
it
,
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“Odd
,
that
—
the
whole
town
knows
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
’s
crying
about
the
streets
,
and
what
’s
the
strangest
thing
of
all
,
nobody
seems
to
know
who
did
it
.
<EOS>
”“Indeed?”“No
,
the
fellow
was
a
complete
stranger
,
and
the
only
man
who
givesanything
like
a
description
of
him
,
is
a
fellow
whom
he
knocked
downnear
Arundel
-
street
.
<EOS>
”“Yes
—
indeed
<EOS>
,
”
was
all
Gray
could
find
breath
to
say
,
for
he
expectedeach
moment
that
the
man
would
pounce
upon
him
,
crying
,
“
You
are
themurderer
—
I
have
been
only
amusing
myself
a
little
with
your
fears
.
<EOS>
”“It
<EOS>
’s
<EOS>
odd
altogether
<EOS>
,
”
continued
the
man
,
“
and
there
’s
<EOS>
fifty
poundsreward
now
offered
by
Vaughan
’s
relations
for
the
man
,
which
,
togetherwith
what
government
will
give
at
his
conviction
,
will
make
a
goodround
sum
.
”“Exactly
<EOS>
—
yes
,
”
said
Gray
,
quite
mechanically
,
for
his
senses
were
in
acomplete
whirl
.
<EOS>
“You
see
that
’s
worth
looking
after
,
”
said
the
man
.
<EOS>
“Yes.—Good
evening
—
good
evening
,
”
said
Gray
,
and
he
tried
to
pass
on
.
<EOS>
“Are
you
going
my
way
?
”
said
the
man
.
<EOS>
“Which
is
your
way?”“Oh
—
why
,
really
I
ai
n’t
at
all
particular
,
and
I
’ll
walk
with
you
,
if
Iam
not
intruding
upon
you?““I
am
going
home

”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“Good
evening
—
I
live
just
here
.
<EOS>
”“You
have
n’t
lost
your
way?”“No
—
no
—
this
place
is
quite
familiar
to
me
—
I
have
known
it
long
.
”“Oh
<EOS>
,
I
thought
you
said
you
were
a
stranger
here
.
<EOS>
”Gray
changed
from
pale
to
red
,
and
from
red
to
pale
again
,
as
hereplied,—“You
misunderstood
me
,
sir
.
”“Oh
,
did
I
?
<EOS>
Very
likely
.
<EOS>
”“Good
evening
.
<EOS>
”“You
had
rather
walk
alone
,
would
you?”Gray
summoned
courage
to
say
with
tolerable
firmness,—“I
would
.
”“Certainly
—
certainly
.
<EOS>
Mind
<EOS>
if
you
see
anybody
that
looks
suspicious
,
lay
hold
of
him
;
it
may
be
the
murderer
,
you
know
,
and
it
would
be
aprime
evening
’s
work
for
anybody
to
nab
him
.
<EOS>
He
is
about
yourheight

thin
and
pale

stoops
a

,
shabbily
dressed

<EOS>
Look

<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
—
I
will
.
<EOS>
Are
you
an
officer?”“No
,
<EOS>
I
’m
a
shoemaker
,
but
I
’ve
a
great
fancy
for
catching
thieves
andthose
kind
of
people
.
”“Curse
<EOS>
your
fancy
,
”
thought
Gray
.
<EOS>
“I
could
n’t
sleep
to
-
night
without
taking
what
I
call
a
prowl
just
tosee
if
the
fates
would
place
in
my
way
the
murderer
.
”“Oh
,
indeed!““Yes
,
and
I
do
n’t
despair
yet
.
<EOS>
Good
evening
—
<EOS>
good
evening
.
<EOS>
”“Good
evening
,
”
replied
Gray
;
and
he
walked
on
with
a
faint
hope
thatafter
all
the
troublesome
shoemaker
,
whom
he
devoutly
wished
dead
andburied
,
did
not
suspect
him
sufficiently
to
annoy
him
any
more
with
hisfollowing
.
<EOS>
To
ascertain
this
point
,
after
he
had
left
him
,
was
a
great
object
toGray
,
as
it
would
afford
him
an
idea
how
to
act
,
and
accordingly
afterhe
had
proceeded
some
distance
,
he
just
glanced
over
his
shoulder
tosee
if
the
man
had
gone
,
and
he
supposed
such
was
the
case
,
for
hecould
<EOS>
neither
see
nor
hear
him
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
,
however
was
reckoning
without
his
host
,
for
not
only
didthe
troublesome
shoemaker
,
who
was
the
pest
of
Westminster
,
from
hislove
of
meddling
with
the
duties
of
the
police
,
<EOS>
strongly
suspect
thathe
had
hit
upon
the
right
man
,
but
he
determined
not
to
lose
sight
ofhim
,
and
had
merely
ensconced
himself
in
a
door
way
until
Gray
shouldhave
got
some
distance
off
,
when
his
intention
was
to
follow
him
verycautiously
till
he
saw
him
housed
somewhere
,
when
he
would
bring
theofficers
upon
him
,
for
he
did
not
like
exactly
to
run
the
risk
ofattempting
the
capture
of
so
desperate
a
character
as
a
murderer
,
whohad
already
taken
one
man
’s
life
merely
because
he
made
an
attempt
tocapture
him

knows
,
”
thought
the
shoemaker
,
“
he
is
a
desperate
chap
,
and
may
bea
great
deal
stronger
than
he
looks
;
he
might
smash
me
just
as
hesmashed
Vaughan
,
and
that
would
be
no
joke
<EOS>
,
I
’ll
dog
him
till
I
see
himfairly
housed
,
and
then
be
down
upon
him
.
<EOS>
”Cunning
,
however
,
as
was
the
troublesome
shoemaker
he
was
scarcely
amatch
for
Jacob
Gray
,
when
the
latter
had
a
little
time
to
collect
hisfaculties
and
was
not
flurried
.
<EOS>
There
were
indeed
but
five
persons
whocould
have
succeeded
in
dogging
Jacob
Gray
without
his
knowing
it
;
andalthough
the
shoemaker
had
in
his
mind
concocted
the
artful
scheme
ofletting
Gray
turn
a
corner
,
and
then
running
after
him
,
and
keeping
himin
sight
,
until
he
had
turned
another
,
he
did
not
know
his
man
<EOS>
,
forthat
was
the
very
course
which
Jacob
Gray
took
good
care
to
provideagainst
by
himself
popping
into
a
doorway
<EOS>
round
the
first
corner
hecame
to
,
and
waiting
patiently
to
see
what
came
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
result
confirmed
his
suspicions
,
for
he
had
not
been
above
twominutes
in
that
doorway
,
than
the
shoemaker
arrived
at
the
corner
atthe
top
of
his
speed
,
and
peered
around
it
with
what
he
consideredamazing
cleverness
and
cunning
.
<EOS>
The
street
was
a
long
one
,
and
he
felt
not
a
little
surprised
atmissing
Gray
in
so
very
sudden
a
manner
.
<EOS>
“Lost
him
,
by
—
—
,
”
he
cried
.
<EOS>
“
He
must
have
gone
into
some
househere
—
that
’s
flat
.
<EOS>
I
’ll
get
a
constable
to
come
with
me
and
will
call
atevery
one
.
<EOS>
I
’d
wager
my
head
he
’s
<EOS>
the
man
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
amateur
officer
now
darted
off
at
a
quick
rate
to
procure
a
realone
,
and
when
he
had
gone
,
Jacob
Gray
emerged
from
his
hiding
-
place
.
<EOS>
He
paused
a
moment
in
the
street
,
and
then
with
bitter
malignity
,
hemuttered,—“Beware
!
<EOS>
I
am
not
a
man
to
be
tempted
too
far
.
”He
<EOS>
then
hastily
walked
in
an
opposite
direction
to
that
taken
by
theshoemaker
,
although
he
had
no
definite
idea
of
where
he
was
going
,
orwhat
he
meant
to
do
until
the
morning
<EOS>
should
afford
him
a
chance
ofseeing
Learmont
.
<EOS>
As
the
excitement
of
the
last
half
-
hour
began
alongwith
its
danger
to
wear
off
,
Jacob
Gray
felt
dreadfully
fatigued
,
notwithstanding
he
had
been
much
supported
by
the
broken
victuals
hehad
received
from
poor
Maud
,
and
he
thought
of
proceeding
to
the
shedsof
Covent
-
garden
,
and
lying
down
to
rest
himself
till
morning
’s
dawn
.
<EOS>
The
rotten
wooden
stalls
and
sheds
of
Covent
-
garden
-
market
,
at
theperiod
of
our
tale
,
were
the
nightly
resort
of
many
who
had
no
otherplace
in
which
to
lay
an
aching
head
and
wearied
body
.
<EOS>
There
,
amongpotato
-
sacks
,
baskets
,
vegetable
refuse
,
and
all
the
mass
of
filth
forwhich
that
now
handsome
market
was
then
so
famous
,
the
weary
,
thedestitute
,
and
the
heart
-
sore
would
find
a
temporary
solace
from
theircares
,
in
the
oblivion
of
sleep
.
<EOS>
But
not
alone
were
the
humble
sheds
of
the
market
occupied
by
the
sonsand
daughters
of
misfortune
and
want
—
<EOS>
a
number
of
the
worthless
andabandoned
characters
who
nightly
prowl
about
the
theatres
had
no
otherplaces
of
refuge
;
and
many
a
thief
and
,
in
some
instances
,
criminals
ofa
higher
grade
in
the
scale
of
iniquity
,
were
pushed
out
by
theofficers
from
among
the
market
lodgers
,
when
he
happened
to
beparticularly
wanted
;
and
when
a
housebreaker
,
or
thief
of
anydescription
,
was
compelled
by
necessity
to
lodge
there
,
he
wastolerably
sure
to
be
particularly
wanted
,
because
such
a
step
augured
astate
of
his
finances
which
was
far
from
enabling
him
to
fee
theofficers
—
a
system
which
although
now
so
very
rare
,
was
a
hundred
yearsago
flourishing
in
all
its
iniquity
and
glory
.
<EOS>
To
the
sheds
,
then
,
of
the
market
,
Jacob
Gray
resolved
to
go
,
but
bymany
fortuitous
accidents
,
he
was
doomed
not

CHAPTER
<EOS>
LXXII.The
Return
of
Learmont.—The
Interview.—Doubts
and
Fears
.
<EOS>
In
his
way
Jacob
Gray
passed
Learmont
’s
house
,
and
he
had
scarcely
gothalf
a
dozen
yards
from
the
door
,
when
he
was
compelled
to
step
aside
,
to
allow
a
cavalcade
to
pass
him
,
consisting
of
some
half
-
dozen
footmenbearing
links
,
followed
by
a
chair
containing
their
master
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
curtains
of
the
sedan
was
but
partially
drawn
,
and
Gray
,
ata
glance
,
saw
that
Learmont
himself
was
the
occupier
of
it
.
<EOS>
Hisresolution
was
formed
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
He
would
risk
whatever
constructionthe
squire
chose
to
put
upon
such
a
visit
,
at
so
singular
an
hour
,
andprocure
some
money
from
him
at
once
for
present
pressing
exigencies
.
<EOS>
He
could
easily
frame
some
lie
to
account
for
his
visit
at
such
anhour
;
and
whether
Learmont
believed
it
or
not
,
it
must
pass
current
,
for
who
could
contradict
it?He
watched
the
haughty
arbiter
of
his
fortunes
get
out
of
the
chair
,
and
ascend
the
steps
of
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
Then
,
before
the
door
could
beclosed
,
he
stepped
forward
;
and
being
just
behind
Learmont
,
he
said,—“I
have
waited
for
you
.
<EOS>
”Learmont
turned
suddenly
,
and
looked
perfectly
astonished
to
see
Gray
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
neither
spoke
.
<EOS>
Then
the
squire
said
,
in
a
low
tone,—“To
-
morrow
morning
,
early
.
”“No
,
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
My
business
is
urgent
and
important
,
I
must
see
youto
-
night
.
<EOS>
”“Must?”“Yes
<EOS>
—
must!”Learmont
bit
his
lip
,
and
passed
into
the
house
,
which
Gray
taking
as
apassive
permission
to
follow
him
,
did
so
,
until
Learmont
paused
in
aroom
devoted
to
the
purpose
of
a
library
,
and
which
was
but
dimlylighted
.
<EOS>
Then
turning
to
Gray
,
he
said,—“Well
?
”
<EOS>
in
a
brief
stern
voice
.
<EOS>
Gray
had
hastily
concocted
in
his
mind
what
he
should
say
to
Learmont
,
and
after
carefully
closing
the
door
,
he
replied
in
nearly
his
usuallow
and
cautious
tone
,
although
his
voice
shook
a
little,—“It
is
not
all
well
.
<EOS>
Squire
Learmont
,
me
thinks
I
should
have
a
betterreception
for
coming
some
distance
,
and
waiting
long
to
tell
you
newsof
more
importance
to
you
than
to
me
.
”Jacob
<EOS>
Gray
was
unconscious
that
he
touched
a
chord
in
Learmont
’s
heart
,
which
had
vibrated
painfully
ever
since
his
interview
with
Britton
;
buthe
saw
,
by
the
nervous
clutching
of
a
back
of
a
chair
with
his
fingers
,
that
Learmont
was
alarmed
,
and
that
was
what
he
wished
.
<EOS>
“What
<EOS>
—
what
—
mean
you
?
”
said
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“I
mean
this
,
”
replied
Gray
,
“
that
Sir
Francis
Hartleton—”“Hartleton
again
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Learmont
,
clenching
his
fist
.
<EOS>
“
By
all
that’sdamnable
—
that
man
is
born
to
be
my
bane
—
my
curse
—
I
will
have
his
blood
.
<EOS>
”Gray
<EOS>
saw
that
he
had
struck
the
right
chord
,
and
he
added,—“I
fear
heis
plotting
and
planning
some
mischief
.
<EOS>
”“You
<EOS>
only
fear?”“Nay
,
I
am
almost
certain
.
”“State
<EOS>
all
you
know
.
<EOS>
”“I
will
.
<EOS>
And
it
is
because
I
know
so
much
that
I
come
to
you
at
sounseasonable
an
hour
.
<EOS>
”“Heed
<EOS>
not
that
,
”
said
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“
All
hours
—
all
times
by
night
and
byday
—
are
alike
to
me
,
for
they
all
teem
with
alarms
.
<EOS>
The
shadow
of
somedreadful
coming
evil
seems
to
press
upon
my
soul
.
<EOS>
Bad
tidings
crowdupon
me
.
<EOS>
Say

Jacob
Gray
,
I
am
prepared
too
well
.
<EOS>
”“What
<EOS>
I
have
to
tell
you
,
”
said
Gray
,
“
consists
more
of
a
certainknowledge
that
there
is
something
to
discover
than
that
somethingitself
.
<EOS>
”“Say

say
on

”“Before
<EOS>
I
speak
,
will
you
,
for
the
first
time
,
let
me
have
a
cup
ofwine
,
for
I
am
very
—
very
faint
.
<EOS>
”“Help
<EOS>
yourself
,
”
said
Learmont
,
pointing
to
a
buffet
at
the
further
endof
the
room
,
on
which
were
refreshments
.
<EOS>
Gray
eagerly
poured
himself
a
glass
of
rich
wine
;
and
as
he
felt
thegenerous
fluid
warm
him
,
his
blood
seemed
to
flow
easier
through
hisveins
,
and
he
appeared
to
have
lifted
half
of
his
cares
from
his
heart
.
<EOS>
“Now
—
now
,
”
said
Learmont
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
“
Tell
me
all
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
will

<EOS>
Early
this
evening
,
I
went
into
a
small
hostel
,
in
Pimlico
,
near
to
the
public
office
of
this
Hartleton—”“Yes
—
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
”“And
there
was
one
,
”
continued
Gray
,
lying
with
a
volubility
that
wouldhave
taken
any
one
in,—“there
one
belonging
to
the
magistrate
’s
office
,
who
had
already
taken
more
drink
than
his
brains
would
stand
.
<EOS>
”“You
—
you

plied
him
well

<EOS>
”“I
did
when
my
suspicions
were
awakened
.
<EOS>
He
was
talking
loudly
,
andamongst
other
things
,
he
said
‘
His
master
had
an
eye
upon
a
certainsquire

not
a
hundred
miles
from
Westminster

who
bid
fair
for
Tyburn

<EOS>
’”“The
knave!—What
—
what
more?”“On
that
I
thought

of
course

on
you

said
Gray
,
with
a
sneeringmalice
in
his
tone
.
<EOS>
“Well
—
<EOS>
well
—
what
followed?”“Why
,
knowing
no
other
squire
in
Westminster
but
yourself
,
with
whom
Icould
couple
the
allusion
to
Tyburn
,
I
called
for
more
drink
andbrought
him
to
converse
with
me
.
<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
—
and
—
what?”“He
dwelt
but
in
obscure
hints
,
”
continued
Gray
,
“
and
at
last
droppedoff
into
a
drunken
sleep
,
which
smothered
all
his
faculties

<EOS>
”“And
you
heard
no
more?”“No
more

<EOS>
”“’Tis
not
much

”“Enough
<EOS>
for
apprehension

suggested
Gray

<EOS>
“Ay

not

”“There

the
curse

<EOS>
I
can
think
of

<EOS>
my
hell!”“Such
thoughts
lured
unpleasant
images
;
but
’
tis
better
to
have
suchslender
information
of
coming
danger
than
to
dream
on
of
safety

tobe
roughly
awakened
by
it
when
it
comes
to
your
doors

<EOS>
”“No

—
<EOS>
no

<EOS>
Apprehension
is
a
fiend
of
far
more
awful
aspect
than
danger

<EOS>
It
only
suggests
the
terrible

leaves
to
the
shrinking

ghastly
picture

Yes

”He
<EOS>
sank
into
a
chair
as
he
spoke
,
and
turned
deathly
white

<EOS>
“Arm
yourself
with
fortitude

said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
You
may

”“There
<EOS>
is

one
course
open

said
Learmont

“Among

in

trembling
<EOS>
apprehension,—“What

”“Peace

”Gray
<EOS>
shrank
and
cowered
before
the
frightened
looks
of
Learmont
,
andafter
a
pause
he
said,—“What
have
you
seen

<EOS>
what

now
I
have
seen
a

to

”“The

Gray

Learmont
,
not
heeding
Gray
’s

Gray

<EOS>
“Only

<EOS>
I
saw
it

”“Was

Gray

<EOS>
“This

”Gray
would
have
given
much
at

moment
to
be
able

ask
withunconcern

had

did
notentertain
a

it
was
several

before

command
his
voice
sufficiently
to
<EOS>
say,—“Where
saw
you
this
appearance?”“Where
<EOS>
all
my

concentrated

where

drew
a
long
breath
as
he
thought
,
“
So
my
worst

<EOS>
She

<EOS>
He
then
said
,
with
a
moreassumed
and
confident
air
than
he
had
hitherto
assumed:—“These

I
grieve

”“Enjoyment

Learmont

with

deep
groan—“you

Learmont

with
a

”“I

CHAPTER
LXXIII.The
Troublesome
Shoe
-
maker.—Gray
’s
Agony
and
Danger.—The
Flight
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
no
longer
was
necessitated
to
take
a
temporary
lodging
amongthe
sheds
of
Covent
-
garden
market
,
for
upon
,
by
the
dim
light
of
alamp
,
examining
Learmont
’s
purse
<EOS>
,
he
found
a
sum
nearly
approaching
totwenty
guineas
in
it
,
and
a
ghastly
smile
same
across
his
face
,
as
,
bythe
mere
possession
of
money
,
he
felt
,
or
fancied
he
felt
,
considerablystronger
and
better
than
he
had
been
for
many
days
.
<EOS>
He
walked
with
a
firmer
step
and
an
air
of
greater
self
-
possession
thanbefore
.
<EOS>
One
of
his
first
acts
was
to
dive
into
a
back
street
,
for
thepurpose
of
finding
some
place
in
which
he
could
lodge
for
the
night
,
and
he
had
not
gone
far
before
he
saw
a
small
dingy
-
lookingpublic
-
house
,
where
he
thought
he
might
find
all
he
wanted
in
the
wayof
rest
and
refreshment
without
risk
.
<EOS>
It
is
strange
how
intense
mental
anxiety
will
overcome
and
smotheralmost
entirely
the
consciousness
of
bodily
pain
.
<EOS>
So
it
was
with
JacobGray
—
for
although
he
had
been
suffering
much
pain
now
for
many
hoursfrom
his
wounded
face
,
his
great
anxiety
of
mind
had
thrown
such
merephysical
annoyance
quite
into
the
shade
;
but
now
that
he
had
money
inhis
pocket
,
and
fancied
he
saw
light
in
the
darkness
of
fate
,
he
beganto
experience
great
agony
from
the
wound
,
and
previous
to
seekingrefreshment
or
rest
he
wished
to
procure
surgical
assistance
lest
anyshots
should
be
remaining
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
With
this
intent
he
walked
onuntil
<EOS>
he
came
to
a
chemist
’s
shop
,
near
Westminster
-
bridge
.
<EOS>
On
enteringthe
little
doorway
,
for
a
very
little
mean
shop
it
was
,
he
asked
of
aman
behind
the
counter
to
examine
his
face
.
<EOS>
“You
have
been
wounded
,
and
had
better
go
to
some
hospital
,
”
said
thesurgeon
,
who
was
one
of
the
self
-
taught
and
self
-
dubbed
medical
men
whoflourished
up
to
within
the
last
thirty
years
.
<EOS>
“I
have
wherewithal
to
pay
you
for
your
services
,
”
said
Gray
,
takingout
<EOS>
Learmont
’s
purse
and
laying
down
a
guinea
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
the
surgeon
,
with
a
good
deal
of
practical
skill
,
carefullyexamined
Gray
’s
face
,
and
extracted
several
of
the
shots
which
hadremained
just
beneath
the
skin
.
<EOS>
“How
<EOS>
did
this
accident
happen
to
you
?
”
<EOS>
said
the
surgeon
.
<EOS>
“A
careless
boy
was
shooting
sparrows
,
”
replied
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
“Ah
!
<EOS>
People
never
will
be
careful
in
the
use
of
fire
-
arms
.
<EOS>
You
will
dovery
well
now
;
a
little
dry
lint
is
all
you
require
,
but
wash
your
facefrequently
with
diluted
milk
.
”“Thank
<EOS>
you
,
”
said
Gray
,
receiving
fifteen
shillings
out
of
his
guinea;“should
<EOS>
I
feel
any
uneasiness
,
I
will
call
again
.
<EOS>
”“That
<EOS>
fellow
has
been
robbing
somebody
,
I
’ll
be
sworn
,
and
been
shot
atfor
his
pains
,
”
remarked
the
surgeon
when
Gray
had
gone
.
<EOS>
“
Well
—
well
,
it
’s
all
one
to
me
,
from
a
peer
to
a
pickpocket
.
<EOS>
”Gray
felt
very
much
relieved
by
the
manipulation
of
the
surgeon
,
and
heretraced
his
steps
towards
a
small
public
-
house
he
had
before
noticed
,
and
which
from
its
plainness
and
obscurity
,
he
thought
would
furnishhim
a
tolerably
secure
retreat
till
he
could
venture
out
again
.
<EOS>
He
was
dreadfully
weary
,
and
the
stars
were
beginning
to
disappear
,
while
a
faint
sickly
light
was
slowly
spreading
itself
over
the
easternhorizon
.
<EOS>
A
very
few
minutes
’
walk
brought
him
to
the
door
of
the
house
,
and
hedived
down
a
steep
step
to
enter
it
.
<EOS>
A
dim
light
only
was
in
the
bar
,
although
it
was
one
of
those
houses
that
keep
open
the
whole
of
thenight
,
under
pretence
of
accommodating
travellers
,
but
really
toaccommodate
thieves
,
watchmen
and
police
-
officers
.
<EOS>
“Can
<EOS>
I
,
”
said
Gray
,
to
a
man
who
was
yawning
in
the
bar,—“can
<EOS>
I
have
abed
here
,
and
some
refreshment?”The
words
were
scarcely
out
of
his
lips
,
when
he
heard
a
noise
behindhim
;
and
turning
hastily
around
,
<EOS>
his
eyes
were
blasted
by
the
sight
ofhis
tormentor
,
the
amateur
officer
and
Shoemaker
,
who
,
with
a
glass
ofsome
steaming
beverage
in
one
hand
,
and
a
pipe
in
the
other
,
stoodglaring
at
Jacob
Gray
as
if
he
was
some
awful
apparition
.
<EOS>
“Bless
me
,
”
he
at
length
found
voice
to
say
,
“
is
it
you?”“I
have
no
knowledge
of
you
,
sir
,
”
said
Gray
,
while
a
cold
perspirationbedewed
his
limbs
,
and
he
glanced
uneasily
at
the
door
,
between
whichand
him
stood
the
troublesome
man
.
<EOS>
“I
—
<EOS>
I
—
you
—
you
,
”
stammered
the
shoemaker
,
“
you
met
me
you
know
about
twohours
ago
,
and
you
said
you
was
a
going
home
.
<EOS>
”“Well
,
sir
.
<EOS>
”“It
<EOS>
’s
an
odd
time
of
night
to
be
out
.
<EOS>
”“Then
<EOS>
why
do
n’t
you
go
home
?
”
<EOS>
said
Gray
,
summoning
all
the
presence
ofmind
he
could
to
his
aid
.
<EOS>
“Ah
<EOS>
—
yes
—
exactly
,
that
is
,
a
—
hem
!
”
<EOS>
said
the
shoemaker
,
feeling
very
muchconfused
,
for
he
was
afraid
to
promote
hostilities
with
Gray
,
andequally
reluctant
to
let
him
go
.
<EOS>
“Can
<EOS>
you
accommodate
me
,
”
said
Gray
,
turning
to
the
woman
,
“
and
twofriends?”“Three
of
you
!
”
<EOS>
groaned
the
shoemaker
.
<EOS>
“Yes
,
”
said
Gray
,
“
I
have
two
friends
waiting
for
me
.
<EOS>
”“There’ll
be
a
great
deal
of
danger
in
having
anything
to
do
with
him,”thought
the
shoemaker
,
“
but
<EOS>
I
’d
wager
ten
guineas
<EOS>
he
’s
the
man
thatkilled
Vaughan
.
<EOS>
”“I
ca
n’t
accommodate
you
all
,
”
said
the
woman
.
<EOS>
“
You
can
stay
here
,
ifyou
like
;
and
your
friends
can
get
a
bed
at
the
King
’s
Arms
at
thebottom
of
the
street
.
”“Thank
<EOS>
you
,
”
said
Gray
,
“
I
will
speak
to
them
;
”
and
he
moved
towardsthe
door
.
<EOS>
The
little
shoemaker
,
however
,
was
not
to
be
so
easily
cajoled
,
butgulping
down
his
glass
of
hot
liquor
,
with
a
speed
that
nearly
chokedhim
,
and
brought
the
tears
into
his
eyes
<EOS>
,
he
moved
to
the
door
at
thesame
time
as
Gray
,
resolved
to
stick
to
him
now
as
long
as
there
was
noactual
bodily
peril
.
<EOS>
Gray
paused
at
the
door
,
and
gave
the
man
a
look
which
caused
him
torecoil
a
step
or
two
within
the
house
.
<EOS>
Then
he
walked
out
into
thestreet
;
but
the
shoemaker
,
although
daunted
for
a
moment
,
was
not
quitegot
rid
of
,
and
with
a
hurried
whisper
to
himself
of,—“It
would
be
the
making
of
me
to
take
him
single
-
handed
,
and
get
allthe
reward
,
”
he
bustled
after
Gray
,
with
the
intention
of
watching
him
.
<EOS>
In
this
,
however
,
the
amateur
officer
was
disappointed
;
for
Gray
,
afterproceeding
half
-
a
-
dozen
paces
,
turned
sharp
round
,
and
caught
theshoemaker
just
coming
out
of
the
door
of
the
public
-
house
.
<EOS>
Gray
was
trembling
with
fear
,
but
he
had
sense
enough
to
feel
that
abold
face
very
frequently
hides
a
shrinking
heart
,
and
he
endeavouredto
throw
as
much
boldness
as
possible
into
his
voice
and
manner
as
hesaid,—“Do
<EOS>
you
want
anything
with
me
,
sir?”“Oh
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
nothing
,
”
said
the
shoemaker
,
“
only
I
thought
you
might
becurious
in
old
houses
,
as
you
had
popped
into
this
one

<EOS>
It
’s
a

I
was
going

tell

twenty

Now
that
’s
curious

what
I
call
very

”“Indeed

”
said
Gray
,
walking
on
and
inwardly
cursing
his
tormentor

<EOS>
“Yes

”
continued
the
shoemaker
,
keeping
up
with
him
,
“

my

one
of
his
ladies

she
got
my

<EOS>
fingerbetween
her
teeth
,

would
n’t
leave
go
till
she
had
bit
it
to

<EOS>
Well
,
sir
,
my
father
took
Jack
to
the
watch
-
house
in
GreatGeorge
-
street
,
and
what
do
you
think
happened
there?”“I
can
not
say
.
<EOS>
”“When
they
got
to
the
door
,
my
father
knocked
,
and
the
moment
it
wasopen
<EOS>
,
Jack
seized
hold
of
him
like
a
tiger
,
and
pitched
him
in
rightupon
the
stomach
of
the
night
-
constable
saying
,
‘
Take
care
of
him

<EOS>
Goodnight
,
and
off
he
went
.
<EOS>
’”They
had
now
reached
the
corner
of
the
street
,
and
Gray
turned
to
hiscompanion
,
saying,—“Sir
,
<EOS>
I
do
not
wish
your
company
.
<EOS>
”“Past
<EOS>
four
and
a
cold
morning
,
”
growled
an
asthmatic
watchman
,
fromsome
distance
off
,
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
“I’ll
stick
by
him
,
”
thought
the
shoemaker
,
“
and
when
we
come
up
to
thewatchman
,
I
’ll
call
upon
him
to
help
me
to
take
him
.
<EOS>
I
must
have
himsomehow
.
<EOS>
”“Oh
,
you
do
n’t
want
company
!
<EOS>
well
,
sir
,
I
’ll
only
walk
with
you
<EOS>
tillyou
meet
your
two
friends
.
<EOS>
”Had
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
,
at
that
moment
of
goaded
passion
,
possessed
any
weaponthat
would
have
noiselessly
and
surely
put
an
end
to
the
ambition
andthe
life
of
the
troublesome
shoemaker
,
he
would
have
used
it
withexquisite
satisfaction
;
but
being
quite
unarmed
,
he
considered
himselfpowerless
;
and
as
is
the
case
in
many
contests
in
life
,
the
affairresolved
itself
simply
to
one
point
,
namely
,
which
should
succeed
infrightening
the
other
.
<EOS>
But
then
the
watchman
might
be
a
powerfulauxiliary
to
his
opponent
,
and
Jacob
Gray
screwed
his
courage
up
to
thesticking
place
,
to
endeavour
to
get
rid
of
his
companion
before
suchaid
should
arrive
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
turned
abruptly
and
cried
in
a
fierceangry
tone,—“How
dare
you
,
sir
,
intrude
yourself
upon
me?”The
<EOS>
shoemaker
started
back
several
paces
,
and
in
evident
alarm
,
cried,—“No
violence
—
no
violence
.
<EOS>
”“Then
leave
me
to
pursue
my
walk
alone
,
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
In
a
word
,
sir
,
Iam
well
armed
,
and
will
not
be
intruded
on
;
your
design
may
be
to
robme
,
for
aught
that
I
know
.
<EOS>
”“Far
from
it
—
far
from
it
,
”
said
the
man
.
<EOS>
“
I
am
a
respectable
tradesman
.
<EOS>
”“Then
<EOS>
you
ought
to
know
better
than
to
force
your
company
upon
thosewho
desire
it
not
,
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“Very
<EOS>
well
,
sir
;
very
well
.
<EOS>
No
offence
;
I
’ll
leave
you
.
<EOS>
Good
evening
,
or
rather
morning
.
<EOS>
”“Past
four
,
and
a
cold
morning
,
”
said
the
watchman
again
,
and
while
theshoemaker
paused
irresolute
for
a
moment
,
Gray
walked
hastily
past
theguardian
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
He
felt
then
how
impolitic
it
would
be
to
look
back
,
but
he
could
notresist
the
impulse
so
to
do
,
and
saw
the
watchman
in
earnestconversation
with
his
late
companion
,
while
the
eyes
of
both
were
bentupon
him
.
<EOS>
The
danger
was
great
,
but
Gray
felt
that
he
should
but
provoke
it
towear
a
still
worse
aspect
by
exhibiting
any
fear
;
so
,
although
he
keptall
his
senses
on
the
qui
vive
,
and
every
nerve
strung
for
action
,
hewalked
but
slowly
away
,
with
something
of
the
same
kind
of
feeling
thatan
adventurous
hunter
might
be
supposed
to
feel
in
some
Indian
junglewhen
retreating
before
a
crouching
tiger
,
who
he
feels
would
springupon
him
were
he
to
show
the
least
sign
of
trepidation
,
but
who
it
isjust
possible
may
let
him
off
if
he
show
a
bold
front
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
reached
in
a
few
moments
the
corner
of
a
street
,
and
then
heventured
another
glance
over
his
shoulder
at
the
motions
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
His
heart
sickened
as
he
saw
the
watchman
give
a
nod
to
his
companion
,
and
then
commence
running
after
him
(
Gray
)
,
at
full
speed
.
<EOS>
With
a
spasmodic
kind
of
gasp
,
produced
by
a
choking
sensation
in
histhroat
,
as
his
extreme
danger
now
rushed
upon
his
brain
,
Jacob
Graydived
down
the
narrow
turning
,
and
fled
like
a
hunted
hare

CHAPTER
LXXIV.Ada
<EOS>
’s
Home.—A
Happy
Scene.—The
Serenity
of
Goodness
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
on
that
same
evening
was
immersed
in
deep
thoughon
Ada
’s
prospects
and
affairs
.
<EOS>
So
multifarious
and
complex
had
evenwhat
<EOS>
he
knew
concerning
her
and
her
fortunes
become
,
putting
aside
allthat
he
surmised
,
that
now
he
had
repaired
to
his
own
quiet
littleroom
,
in
which
he
was
never
interrupted
and
sat
down
,
as
much
for
theclearing
of
his
own
mind
upon
the
subject
,
as
for
any
otherconsiderations
,
to
write
in
detail
all
the
various
circumstancesconnected
with
the
history
and
fortunes
of
Ada
.
<EOS>
When
he
came
fairly
to
separate
what
he
knew
from
what
he
only
surmisedhe
felt
much
disappointed
at
the
limited
facts
that
really
appearedupon
paper
,
and
as
we
have
before
intimated
,
he
found
himself
in
thedisagreeable
position
of
suspecting
much
and
knowing
little
—
able
tosurmise
much
more
than
he
could
prove
,
and
morally
certain
of
manythings
which
he
despaired
of
ever
finding
the
means
of
making
clear
byproof
.
<EOS>
The
connection
of
Learmont
with
the
same
crimes
in
which
Gray
andBritton
had
been
participators
was
very
clear
,
but
could
he
specifythose
crimes
?
<EOS>
It
was
not
enough
to
say—“So
and
so
is
a
criminal
,
”
butit
was
necessary
to
tell
and
define
such
a
charge
;
and
Sir
FrancisHartleton
felt
keenly
all
the
advantage
which
such
a
man
as
Learmontwould
have
over
him
,
were
he
to
make
a
loose
and
unsupported
attackagainst
him
.
<EOS>
Having
finished
his
narrative
,
Sir
Francis
sat
in
deep
thought
for
morethan
an
hour
,
but
yet
could
not
form
any
satisfactory
conclusion
,
nordetermine
upon
any
course
of
action
which
would
not
be
attended
withwhat
<EOS>
he
considered
the
worst
consequence
of
all
,
namely
,
puttingLearmont
thoroughly
upon
his
guard
.
<EOS>
He
foresaw
that
he
could
not
persevere
,
for
a
very
long
period
of
time
,
upon
the
unwilling
and
rather
unprecedented
power
given
to
him
by
theSecretary
of
State
,
but
that
Jacob
Gray
must
shortly
be
apprehended
forthe
murder
of
Vaughan
,
when
it
was
more
than
probable
that
<EOS>
all
chanceof
discovering
Ada
’s
real
history
through
him
would
be
lost
;
for
whatinducement
could
be
offered
to
such
a
man
as
Gray
to
do
an
act
ofjustice
,
when
his
own
life
could
not
by
any
possibility
be
spared
,
butmust
be
taken
by
the
hands
of
the
law
for
a
clear
and
distinctmurder,—not
to
take
into
consideration
the
assassination
of
Elias
,
inthe
lone
house
at
Battersea
.
<EOS>
It
had
more
than
once
occurred
to
the
mind
of
the
magistrate
to
searchthe
ruins
of
the
house
in
which
Gray
had
resided
,
but
then
,
as
often
,
the
extreme
improbability
of
such
a
man
leaving
anything
behind
him
ofa
character
to
criminate
him
in
any
way
,
saving
the
dead
body
of
themurdered
officer
,
came
so
strongly
across
him
that
he
rejected
asuseless
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
The
smithy
,
too
,
at
Learmont
he
longed
to
search
effectually
,
but
howcould
he
do
so
without
observation
in
such
a
place
;
and
should
such
aproceeding
come
to
the
ears
of
Learmont
<EOS>
,
he
might
well
complain
of
atrespass
upon
his
own
premises
,
for
the
purpose
of
endeavouring
to
getup
some
charge
against
him
of
a
secret
and
undeclared
nature
.
<EOS>
“No
,
”
exclaimed
Hartleton
,
with
disappointment
,
as
he
rose
from
hischair
,
“
I
must
not
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
resource
but
patience
,
and
,
for
a
shorttime
,
this
man
Gray
,
with
all
his
crimes
upon
his
head
,
must
besuffered
to
remain
at
large
,
unless
some
meddling
person
apprehends
himupon
suspicion
merely
,
in
which
case
the
law
must
take
its
course
;
foralthough
I
can
and
may
take
no
steps
to
make
him
a
prisoner
,
I
dare
notdischarge
him
if
once
taken
.
<EOS>
”As
<EOS>
we
have
mentioned
,
it
was
mere
humanity
which
induced
Sir
FrancisHartleton
to
order
poor
Maud
to
be
brought
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
farindeed
from
suspecting
her
possession
of
the
important
scraps
of
JacobGray
’s
written
confession
,
which
she
had
rescued
from
among
the
charredrafters
of
the
house
at
Battersea
and
he
received
the
report
of
theofficer
,
who
had
been
commissioned
to
find
her
to
the
effect
that
hehad
not
yet
been
able
to
take
her
,
without
much
feeling
upon
thesubject
,
engrossed
as
his
mind
was
with
other
matters
.
<EOS>
After
thus
turning
the
whole
affair
over
in
his
mind
,
and
,
for
thepresent
resolving
to
do
nothing
,
but
wait
and
see
what
the
chapter
ofaccidents
would
bring
forth
Sir
Francis
left
his
study
,
and
sought
thesociety
of
his
young
and
amiable
wife
and
Ada
.
<EOS>
During
the
very
short
residence
of
Ada
with
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
andhis
lady
,
she
had
endeared
herself
greatly
to
them
.
<EOS>
Her
love
oftruth
—
her
earnest
depreciation
of
every
wrong
,
and
the
sweet
simplicityof
her
character
had
placed
her
so
high
in
their
esteem
,
that
they
hadresolved
she
should
never
leave
the
friendly
shelter
of
the
roof
,
unless
circumstances
should
arise
to
place
her
in
a
happy
home
of
herown
.
<EOS>
From
all
these
circumstances
and
conclusions
,
it
will
be
seen
that
notone
of
our
characters
,
variously
situated
as
they
are
,
have
great
causefor
congratulation
on
their
prospects
,
with
the
exception
of
Ada
,
towhom
<EOS>
it
was
a
new
and
beautiful
existence
to
be
free
from
thepersecutions
of
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
There
was
but
one
sad
spot
in
the
younggirl
’s
heart
now
,
and
that
was
,
that
loving
,
respecting
,
and
admiringas
<EOS>
she
did
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
and
his
lady
<EOS>
,
she
did
not
feel
forthem
what
she
felt
for
Albert
Seyton
;
and
many
,
very
many
of
thegushing
feeling
of
her
heart
were
constrained
to
calmness
and
merecourtesy
,
because
she
felt
that
to
the
ears
of
a
lover
would
they
aloneseem
other
than
the
enthusiastic
dreams
of
a
young
and
ardentimagination
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
’s
wife
,
as
we
have
remarked
,
sympathised
much
more
with
Adaconcerning
the
probable
fate
or
circumstances
of
Albert
Seyton
,
thanher
husband
could
be
expected
to
do
;
and
it
was
at
<EOS>
her
solicitationthat
<EOS>
he
now
gave
directions
to
some
of
his
most
active
officers
,
tospare
neither
expense
nor
trouble
to
discover
if
the
young
man
was
inLondon

CHAPTER
LXXV.Britton
in
His
Glory
Again.—The
Song
and
the
Legal
Functionary.—TheSurprise
.
<EOS>
The
deadly
hatred
which
Learmont
felt
for
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
was
amild
feeling
in
comparison
with
that
of
the
same
nature
which
began
toengross
the
entire
mind
of
Andrew
Britton
.
<EOS>
Learmont
<EOS>
he
did
certainly
,
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
,
dislike
;
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
he
detested
and
hatedmost
cordially
;
but
under
the
circumstances
in
which
he
was
placed
,
hehad
come
to
consider
them
both
as
out
of
reach
of
any
species
ofrevenge
he
would
feel
gratified
in
having
upon
them
.
<EOS>
Besides
he
lookedupon
them
both
as
mixed
up
with
himself
in
the
various
occurrences
<EOS>
thathad
shaped
the
whole
of
his
existence
,
and
he
began
to
think
Learmont
apoor
creature
,
useful
only
to
supply
his
extravagancies
,
and
Jacob
Grayas
a
kind
of
necessary
or
,
at
least
,
inevitable
evil
to
be
endured
,
asfar
<EOS>
as
his
existence
went
,
with
much
the
same
feelings
as
he
would
putup
with
the
disagreeables
of
the
changing
seasons
,
or
some
other
bodilyailment
it
was
in
vain
to
fight
against
.
<EOS>
But
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
what
had
he
to
do
with
the
affair
?
<EOS>
And
yetwas
he
not
perpetually
thrusting
himself
forward
in
the
mostdisagreeable
manner
,
and
thwarting
him
,
Britton
,
at
the
mostinauspicious
moment
,
and
in
the
manner
calculated
,
of
all
others
,
toaggravate
him
—
namely
,
by
an
exercise
of
personal
strength?When
<EOS>
Britton
was
in
that
intermediate
stage
of
intoxication
whichinfluenced
his
passions
,
he
would
dash
his
fist
upon
the
table
,
andcall
down
curses
upon
the
head
of
his
enemy
,
as
terrible
and
fierce
intheir
language
as
they
were
violent
and
outrageous
in
manner
.
<EOS>
Bond
,
thebutcher
,
was
his
great
companion
on
all
such
occasions
,
and
no
one
wasbetter
calculated
than
that
individual
to
second
Britton
in
any
word
ordeed
of
violence
.
<EOS>
Britton
had
his
usual
large
party
at
the
Chequers
,
while
Jacob
Gray
wasbeing
hunted
through
Westminster
by
the
extremely
officious
shoemaker
.
<EOS>
His
friend
the
butcher
sat
by
his
side
,
and
whenever
Britton
roared
outan
oath
,
Master
Bond
was
sure
to
cap
it
by
some
other
of
the
mostunique
character
.
<EOS>
The
time
was
past
midnight
,
and
yet
there
was
the
rattling
ofglasses
—
the
thumping
of
tankards
—
the
shouts
—
screams
—
laughter
and
oathsof
the
motley
assembly
,
proceeding
in
full
vigour
.
<EOS>
The
landlord
,
when
Westminster
Abbey
chimes
struck
the
half
hour
pasttwelve
,
rushed
into
the
room
with
a
bland
smile
,
after
relieving
hismind
at
the
door
by
a
hearty
curse
,
and
approaching
Britton
,
he
said,—“Might
I
be
so
bold
as
to
remind
your
most
worshipful
majesty
<EOS>
that
itis
now
half
-
past
twelve?”“No
,
you
might
not
,
”
roared
Britton
;
“
<EOS>
what
’s
time
to
me
,
I
should
liketo
know
?
<EOS>
Are
you
king
of
the
Chequers
,
or
am
I?”“With
humble
submission
to
your
majesty
,
<EOS>
of
course
your
majesty
is
kingof
the
Chequers
,
but
your
highness
must
be
aware
that
the
magistratesare
dreadfully
jealous
of
a
poor
fellow
keeping
his
house
open
so
late
.
<EOS>
”“I
suppose
you
may
open
as
early
as
you
like
?
”
<EOS>
roared
Britton
.
<EOS>
“Certainly
,
your
highness
’s
grace
.
<EOS>
”“Very
<EOS>
well
;
if
any
one
comes
to
say
a

,
tell
him
you
shut
up
attwelve

Do

said
the
landlord
,
“
was
thereever
such
a

shouted
the

“His

gracious
majesty

said
a
man
rising
at
the
further
endof
the
room
;
“
and
may
I
be
butchered
if

<EOS>
”“What
<EOS>
do
you

by

you
be
butchered

”
said
Bond
.
<EOS>
“No
reflection
upon
you

good
Master
Bond

said
the
man
;
“
I
only

I

<EOS>
”“Then
<EOS>
do
n’t
do
it

said
Bond
,
making
three
strides
towards
theman
,
and
knocking
his
head
against
the
wainscot
till
the
lights
dancedagain
in
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
That
was
just
the
kind
of
thing
to
arouse
Britton
,
and
he
roared
withlaughter
at
the
faces
the
man
mad
.
<EOS>
“Is
<EOS>
a
man

”
remarked
the
butcher
,
“
to
have
his
trade

let
it
be
ever
sorespectable

throwed

in
his
face?”“Bravo

<EOS>
cried
Britton
;
“

bring
us
another

<EOS>
Quick!”“Yes

your

<EOS>
Oh

a

<EOS>
”“Well
<EOS>
,
who
the
devil
are
you
?
”
<EOS>
said
Britton
,
as
a
stranger
entered
theroom
.
<EOS>
“An

a

”“A

<EOS>
Whom
do
you
serve

<EOS>
eh?”“The
worshipful
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
hard
by

<EOS>
”“Take
<EOS>
that
then
,
”
said
Britton
,
flinging
a
pewter
measure
at
the
poorfellow
’s
head
,
which
luckily
missed
him
;
“
how
dare
you
come
here
,
yousneaking

man
made
a
precipitate
retreat
,
and
when
the
landlord
came
with
asteaming
bowl
of
punch
,
Britton
with
an
oath
<EOS>
exclaimed,—“Haven’t
<EOS>
I
told
you
that
I
would
have
none
of
that
Hartleton
’s
peoplehere?”“Your
majesty
certainly
was
so
gracious
as
to
say
so
,
but
he
,
whom
yourgrace
has
so
very
judiciously
turned
out
,
tells
me
he
has
only
been
fora

I
knew
him

”“Sharpen
<EOS>
your
wits

said
Britton
,
throwing
the
remnants
of
thebutcher
’s
flagon
of
strong
ale
in
the
landlord
’s
face
.
<EOS>
“Oh
,
what
a
wit
he
has!”“Curse
<EOS>
Hartleton
—
curse
him
!
”
<EOS>
growled
Britton
.
<EOS>
“So
<EOS>
say
I
,
”
said
the
butcher
.
<EOS>
“
He
has
twice
sent
some
one
to
condemn
myscales

<EOS>
”“Sing
<EOS>
us
<EOS>
a
song

somebody

cried
Britton

<EOS>
“
A

Do

cried
thelandlord

bustling
among
the
guests

<EOS>
“
You

that

inclined

<EOS>
”“Well

said
a
small
man
,
with
a
twisted
lace
coat
,
“
<EOS>
I
don’tmind

I
try
my

<EOS>
”There
was
a
great
thumping
of
tankards
upon
the
tables
,
and
cries
of“Bravo
!
”
<EOS>
in
the
middle
of
which
the
man
who
had
volunteered
the
songcommenced
in
a
wheezing
tone
as
follows:—The
Triple
Tree“Of
all
the
trees
that
’s
in

,
There
’s
none
like
that
I

of;The

But
if

The
fruit
’s
so
ripe
and
brown
,
That
when
an
hour
has
passed
away
,
We
always
cut
it
down
,
Hurrah
,
boys!”“Silence
!
”
<EOS>
roared
Britton
,
as
the
man
was
about
to
commence
the
secondverse
of
his
song
.
<EOS>
“
<EOS>
What
the
devil
<EOS>
’s
<EOS>
song
<EOS>
do
you
call
that?”“The
Triple
Tree

<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
what
may
that
be?”“The
gallows
,
”
said
the
man
,
emphatically
.
<EOS>
“Then
who
the
devil
are
you?”“The
<EOS>
hangman!”All
shrunk
from
the
man
as
he
announced
his
calling
;
and
for
a
minuteor
two
a
ghastly
sallow
paleness
came
over
Britton
’s
face
.
<EOS>
“Very
<EOS>
well
,
gentleman
,
”
said
the
hangman
,
“
<EOS>
if
you
do
n’t
like
my
song
<EOS>
,
you
need
n’t
have
the
remainder
of
it
<EOS>
I
,
am
sure
.
<EOS>
”Britton
rose
from
his
seat
in
a
menacing
attitude
as
he
said,—“Now
,
may
I
be
smashed
if
ever
I
met
with
such
assurance
in
all
mylife
.
<EOS>
You
horrid
—
<EOS>
you
infernal—”“My
good
fellow
,
do
n’t
put
yourself
in
a
passion
,
”
said
the
hangman
.
<EOS>
“I’ve
come
all
the
way
from
Smithfield
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
”“See
<EOS>
me?”“Yes
.
<EOS>
I
heard
of
you
,
and
I
came
to
take
your
weight
in
my
eye
—
youunderstand

<EOS>
It
will
require
a
good
piece
of
hemp
to
hold
you
up

<EOS>
Youare
bony

and
that
always
weighs
heavy

<EOS>
Good
night
—
<EOS>
I’ll
drop
in
againsome
evening

<EOS>
”With
<EOS>
these
words
the
functionary
of
the
law
was
off
before
Brittoncould
make
a
rush
at
him
,
which
he
was
just
recovering
sufficientlyfrom
his
surprise
to
enable
him
to
do
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
when
he
found
the
hangman
had
fairly
escaped
him
,
he
lookedround
him
like
some
wild
animal
just
turned
out
of
a
cage
,
and
glaringabout
to
seek
for
some
enemy
upon
whom
to
wreak
his
pent

up
vengeance
.
<EOS>
“He
<EOS>
ai
n’t
far
off
,
I
’ll
be
bound
,
”
cried
the
butcher
,
“
I
dare
say
he’swaiting
outside
.
<EOS>
”Britton
<EOS>
upon
this
suggestion
rushed
from
the
room
,
and
was
at
thestreet
-
door
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
man
shrinking
just
within
thedoorway
,
and
without
further
examination
,
Britton
seized
him
with
bothhands
,
and
found
himself
face
to
face
with
Jacob
Gray
.

CHAPTER
<EOS>
LXXVI.The
<EOS>
Old
Associates.—Gray
’s
<EOS>
Fears.—The
Old
Attic
at
the
Chequers
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
light
in
the
passage
,
which
shed
a
strong
full
glare
uponthe
pallid
care
worn
features
of
Gray
;
and
Andrew
Britton
,
as
he
heldhim
at
arm
<EOS>
’s
length
turned
nearly
as
pale
as
he
was
with
the
intensesurprise
of
the
meeting
.
<EOS>
He
was
sobered
by
the
shock
,
and
in
a
huskywhisper
he
muttered
the
name
of
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
Such
awful
and
abject
fear
seemed
to
take
possession
of
Gray
that
hadnot
Britton
held
him
,
he
must
have
fallen
at
his
feet
.
<EOS>
All
his
presenceof
mind
and
cunning
appeared
to
have
deserted
him
,
and
it
was
not
untilBritton
had
again
pronounced
his
name
that
he
gasped,—“Is
—
is
it
you
,
Andrew
Britton
?
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
—
I
am
glad
to
see
you
look
so
well
.
<EOS>
”“Yes
by
God
,
”
said
Britton
,
“
it
is
me
.
<EOS>
What
wind
from
hell
blew
youhere?”“I
—
<EOS>
I
,
you
are
looking
very
well
,
”
said
Gray
,
with
a
sickly
smile
.
<EOS>
“Curses
on
my
looks
,
and
yours
too
<EOS>
,
I
say
again
what
brought
you
here?”“To
—
to
see
you
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
I
thought
as
we
had
been
old
friends
,
Iwould
come
and
—
and
see
you
.
<EOS>
You
rather
hurt
me
,
Britton
.
<EOS>
”“You
canting
,
whining
villain
,
”
said
Britton
,
“
I
will
know
what
broughtyou
here
,
or
I
will
smash
your
head
against
the
door
-
post
.
”“Violent
<EOS>
,
Britton
,
still
violent
to
poor
Jacob
Gray
,
who
comes
to
doyou
good
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
my
dear
Britton—”“Just
say
that
again
,
”
cried
Britton
,
“
and
I’ll—”He
tightened
his
grasp
upon
Gray
,
who
had
just
breath
sufficient
togasp
out—“Remember
—
my
—
confession
!
<EOS>
The
gallows!”Britton
relaxed
his
hold
,
and
a
slight
tremor
passed
over
his
frame
ashe
said
in
a
lower
tone,—“Jacob
Gray
,
you
must
have
something
damnable
to
say
or
propose
to
me!”“Not
exactly
,
Britton
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
there
is
danger
abroad
to
us
both!”“Danger?”“Yes
,
Britton
.
<EOS>
Of
course
when
I
thought
any
danger
threatened
,
I
saidto
myself
,
<EOS>
shall
I
not
warn
good
,
kind
,
peaceable
,
inoffensive
Britton
.
<EOS>
”“You
infernal
liar
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Britton
.
<EOS>
“So
<EOS>
having
,
”
resumed
Gray
,
not
heeding
any
interruption
,
“
so
havingplaced
my
written
confession
where
,
in
case
I
return
not
soon
,
it
wouldbe
easily
found
and
forwarded
to
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
I
came
,
yousee
,
here
at
once
.
<EOS>
”“Sir
Francis
Hartleton
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Britton
;
“
if
you
have
anything
really
tosay
it
is
of
him
,
I
’ll
be
sworn
.
<EOS>
He
has
been
hunting
me
,
but
I
willhave
his
heart
’s
hood
,
I
will!”Gray
caught
at
the
suggestion
,
and
immediately
replied,—“Yes
—
yes
,
Britton
,
it
was
of
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
<EOS>
I
came
to
warn
you
.
”“Indeed
<EOS>
,
on
your
soul?”“On
my
soul
it
was
.
<EOS>
He
is
hatching
some
mischief
against
us
all
,
Britton
,
and
do
you
think
I
will
let
an
old
friend
fall
into
danger
,
and
not
warn
him
?
<EOS>
So
as
I
say
,
after
placing
my
full
and
carefullywritten
confession—”“Now
,
Jacob
Gray
,
”
said
Britton
,
“
if
you
say
another
word
about
yourd
—
d
confession
,
I
will
brain
you
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
only
wished
you
to
understand
our
relative
positions
,
my
goodBritton
,
”
said
Gray
,
who
was
rapidly
overcoming
his
first
fright
,
andwith
his
usual
fertility
of
invention
scheming
to
overcome
Britton
bycunning
.
<EOS>
“There
,
there
,
that
will
do
.
<EOS>
Let
me
hear
no
more
of
it
,
”
said
Britton
.
<EOS>
“Come
in
.
<EOS>
”Gray
hesitated
a
moment
,
and
Britton
,
bending
his
brows
upon
him
,
said,—“Why
,
you
are
as
safe
in
the
Chequers
at
Westminster
,
as
you
were
atthe
Old
Smithy
at
Learmont
.
<EOS>
Why
do
you
shrink
,
man
?
<EOS>
You
know
,
and
Imake
no
secret
of
it
,
that
I
would
as
soon
dash
out
your
brains
as
lookat
you
,
if
I
could
do
so
with
safety
.
<EOS>
Come
in
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
”“I
am
quite
sure
,
”
muttered
Gray
,
“
I
may
depend
upon
such
an
old
friendas
Britton
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
followed
Britton
as
he
spoke
,
and
the
smith
,
crossing
the
bar
,
ascended
two
flights
of
stairs
to
his
own
sleeping
room
,
into
which
heushered
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
have
company
down
stairs
,
and
be
cursed
to
them
,
”
he
said
.
<EOS>
“
Waithere
till
I
come
back
to
you
.
<EOS>
”“You
<EOS>
—
you
wo
n’t
be
long
,
Britton?”“But
five
minutes
.
<EOS>
”Britton
left
the
room
,
and
after
proceeding
down
about
three
stairs
,
hecame
back
and
,
to
Gray
’s
dismay
,
locked
the
door
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
“So
—
<EOS>
so
,
”
murmured
Gray
,
playing
his
fingers
nervously
upon
the
back
ofa
chair
.
<EOS>
“
Here
I
am
hunted
through
Westminster
,
and
forced
at
length
totake
refuge
with
Andrew
Britton
—
he
who
has
avowedly
sought
my
life
,
andwould
take
it
now
,
but
for
fear
of
my
confession
.
<EOS>
Have
I
ever
been
insuch
desperate
straits
as
this
before
?
<EOS>
Yes
—
yes
—
I
have
,
and
yet
escaped
.
<EOS>
Surely
he
will
not
kill
me
.
<EOS>
He
dare
not
.
<EOS>
Yet
he
drinks
largely
,
and
mayremember
then
his
revenge
,
and
hatred
against
me
,
while
he
forgets
hisown
safety
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
if
Andrew
Britton
knew
how
safe
it
was
to
murder
JacobGray
,
I
should
never
see
another
sunrise
.
<EOS>
I
am
in
most
imminentdanger
—
very
imminent
danger
,
indeed
,
and
locked
in
too
.
<EOS>
What
willbecome
of
me
?
<EOS>
What
have
toiled
for
,
what
committed
crime
upon
crimefor
,
what
dipped
my
hands
in
blood
for
,
if
I
am
to
be
hunted
thus
,
impoverished
,
and
<EOS>
a
price
to
be
set
upon
my
head?”Jacob
Gray
leaned
his
head
upon
his
hands
,
and
groaned
aloud
,
in
thebitterness
of
his
despair
.
<EOS>
Then
after
a
time
he
rose
and
carefully
examined
the
door
with
aforlorn
hope
,
that
he
might
be
able
by
some
means
to
escape
by
it
,
andslinking
down
the
staircase
,
leave
the
house
;
but
it
was
quite
fast
,
and
although
his
strength
might
have
been
sufficient
to
break
it
open
,
that
was
a
mode
of
operation
attended
with
far
too
much
noise
to
answerhis
purpose
.
<EOS>
“I
am
a
prisoner
here
,
”
he
said,—“a
prisoner
to
Andrew
Britton
,
and
myonly
chance
of
safety
consists
now
in
acting
upon
his
fears
,
andarousing
his
anger
more
against
Hartleton
.
<EOS>
He
is
long
in
coming,—whatcan
be
detaining
him
?
<EOS>
Has
he
gone
to
Learmont
’s
,
and
are
they
togetherhatching
some
plot
for
my
destruction
?
<EOS>
Am
I
safe
,
or
—
or
am
I
on
thevery
brink
of
the
grave
?
<EOS>
My
heart
sinks
within
me
.
<EOS>
Surely
he
has
beengone
an
hour
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
alarm
the
house
?
<EOS>
No
—
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
I
am
then
taken
for
athief
;
and
,
perhaps
,
dragged
before
Hartleton
,
who
would
not
fail
torecognise
me
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
weapon
here
to
protect
myself,—no
means
ofescape
.
<EOS>
”A
<EOS>
sudden
thought
seemed
to
strike
Gray
,
and
he
took
up
the
candle
whichBritton
had
brought
from
the
bar
,
and
left
with
him
.
<EOS>
“Does
Britton
,
”
he
muttered
,
“
keep
his
confession
here
with
—
my
knife?Oh
,
if
I
could
find
those,—if
<EOS>
I
could

I
would

Learmont
for

<EOS>
”With
<EOS>
a
stealthy
step
,
and
a
damp
clammy
perspiration
of
fear
upon
hisbrow
,
Jacob
Gray
crept
about
the
room
,
which
was
at
the
top
of
thehouse
,
peering
into
every
hole
and
corner
in
search
of
the
much
-
dreadedconfession
of
Andrew
Britton
.
<EOS>
His
search
was
in
vain
—
there
was
no
paper
to
be
found
of
anydescription
and
he
sat
down
at
length
in
despair
.
<EOS>
“’Tis
in
vain—’tis
in
vain
,
”
he
groaned
.
<EOS>
“
I
am
the
victim
of
somecontrivance
of
Britton
’s
to
destroy
me
,
or
he
would
have
returned
eyethis
.
<EOS>
I
am
lost
—
lost
—
lost
.
”Jacob
<EOS>
Gray
wrung
his
hands
,
and
wept
like
a
child
,
as
he
thought
hishour
was
come
.
<EOS>
A
long
,
straggling
ray
of
light
came
in
at
the
window
now
,
and
hestarted
up
exclaiming,—“There
<EOS>
is
one
hope
more
—
the
window
—
the
window
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
casement
was
one
of
those
with
diamond
-
shaped
panes
,
held
togetherby
thin
slips
of
lead
,
and
Jacob
Gray
saw
that
immediately
under
it
wasa
filthy
gutter
.
<EOS>
“One
hope
—
one
hope
,
”
he
muttered
;
and
cautiously
drawing
himselfthrough
the
window
,
he
closed
it
again
,
and
stood
in
the
gutter
.
<EOS>
On
oneside
of
him
was
the
high
sloping
roof
of
the
attic
,
and
on
the
otherwas
a
narrow
crumbling
parapet
.
<EOS>
With
a
shudder
,
he
looked
down
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
An
itinerant
breakfastprovider
had
taken
up
his
station
immediately
below
,
and
several
earlypassengers
were
hurrying
onwards
to
different
employments
.
<EOS>
A
boy
looked
up
,
and
said,—“There
he
goes!”Gray
could
have
cut
his
throat
with
pleasure
,
but
he
could
only
cursehim
,
and
creep
on
,
while
the
urchin
pointing
him
out
to
the
saloondealer
,
who
,
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hands
,
said
in
a
voice
that
cameclearly
to
Jacob
Gray
’s
ears,—“It
’s
some
thief
,
I
’ll
be
bound
,
but
it
’s
no

LXXVII.The
Smith
’s
Plot
Against
Gray.—An
Accommodating
Friend
.
<EOS>
When
Britton
left
Jacob
Gray
in
his
room
,
he
descended
but
to
the
firstlanding
-
place
of
the
stairs
,
and
then
paused
to
consider
what
he
hadbetter
do
under
the
circumstances
so
new
and
so
strange
as
Gray
takingrefuge
with
him
from
some
danger
to
himself
,
or
coming
to
consult
withhim
upon
some
common
danger
to
them
both
.
<EOS>
This
latter
supposition
was
,
however
,
too
extravagant
for
Britton
to
believe
;
and
when
he
came
toconsider
all
the
circumstances
—
his
finding
Gray
skulking
by
the
door
,
and
his
evident
confusion
and
fear
when
he
was
seized
and
seen
,
Brittonwith
a
blow
of
his
clenched
fist
upon
his
hand
<EOS>
exclaimed,—“I
see
it
now
—
the
sneaking
villain
was
acting
the
spy
upon
me
.
<EOS>
He
wantsto
take
my
life
—
<EOS>
it
’s
all
a
d
—
d
scheme
of
his
,
but
I
will
be
even
withhim
,
or
my
name

n’t
Andrew
Britton
.
<EOS>
Let
me
consider
—
<EOS>
I’ll
get
Bond
towatch
him
home
from
here
—
<EOS>
a
capital
plan
—
he
do
n’t
know
Bond
,
and
willnever
suspect
he
is
followed
.
<EOS>
Then
when
he
finds
out
where
he
lives
,
wecan
go
together
,
Bond
and
I
,
and
knock
his
infernal
brains
out
.
<EOS>
That’lldo
.
<EOS>
”Having
<EOS>
satisfactorily
to
himself
settled
this
line
of
operations
,
andconsidering
Gray
perfectly
safe
till
he
chose
to
release
him
,
Brittonmade
his
appearance
again
in
the
parlour
of
the
Chequers
.
<EOS>
“Come
<EOS>
on
,
”
cried
Bond
,
“
there
has
n’t
been
no
time
lost
while
you
wasgone
for
I
’ve
been
drinking
for
you
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
thank
you

”
said
Britton—“landlord
,
<EOS>
do
you
hear
me
,
never
open
yourdoor
to
a
hangman
again
.
”“It
<EOS>
was
a
piece
of
great
impudence
,
”
said
the
landlord
,
“
of
such
awretch
coming
here
.
”
<EOS>
Then
he
added
to
himself
,
“
Bless
me
,
if
he
don’tseem
quite
sober
all
of
a
sudden
,
and
he
was
a
going

finely
a
littlewhile
ago

<EOS>
I
do
wonder
now
if
he
will
recollect
how
much
liquor
he
hashad

”“Hurrah

”
<EOS>
cried
Britton
’s
guests—“Hurrah
for

We
’ll
drinkhis

”“D

you
’ll
do
it
at
your

said
Britton
.
<EOS>
“
Whatdo
you
mean
by
sotting
here
at
this
time
,
eh
?
<EOS>
Clear
out
with

will
you?”“Well
,
I
do
think
it’s
—
<EOS>
it
’s
nearly
time
to
go
,
”
hiccupped
one
man
.
<EOS>
“Off
with
you
all
!
”
cried
Britton
.
<EOS>
“
Clear
the
house
,
landlord
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
motley
assembly
,
who
among
themselves
could
not
have
mustered
theprice
of
a
jug
of
ale
,
rose
in
obedience
to
Britton
’s
commands
,
andavowing
their
intention
of
coming
to
see
him
on
the
morrow
evening
,
they
,
with
much
noise
and
boisterous
clamour
,
took
their
departure
fromthe
Chequers
.
<EOS>
In
a
very
minutes
none
were
in
the
parlour
but
the
landlord
,
Britton
,
and
the
butcher
.
<EOS>
The
smith
then
turned
to
his
host
,
and
said,—“Bring
me
some
spiced
canary
,
and
keep
every
body
out
of
here
.
<EOS>
”“Yes
,
your
majesty
<EOS>
—
most
certainly
—
oh
dear
yes!”The
spiced
canary
was
soon
set
before
the
precious
couple
,
and
thenBritton
,
after
a
hearty
draught
,
handed
the
liquor
to
the
butcher
,
whowith
a
nod
that
might
imply
any
toast
that
his
companion
liked
totranslate
it
into
,
nearly
finished
the
beverage
.
<EOS>
“Bond
,
”
said
Britton
,
“
I
want
you
to
do
a
little
job
for
me

<EOS>
”“I’m

your

said
the
butcher

<EOS>
“
What
is
it?”“In

up

”“A

<EOS>
”“You

He

track

”
<EOS>
said
Bond
,
rather
astonished
at
the
vehemence
of
Britton
.
<EOS>
“I
say
you
must
follow
him
closely

something

his
home
that
I

<EOS>
”“Oh

<EOS>
Then
we
must
let

I

But
I’drather

”“You

<EOS>
”Britton
was
fast
relapsing
into
his
former
state
of
semi
-
intoxication
,
and
he
struck
his
fists
repeatedly
upon
the
table
as
he
continued,—“He

kept
taking
huge
draughts
of
liquor
as
he
instructed
thebutcher
,
in
what
he
wished
him
to
do
,

now
his
voice
began
tothicken

he
had

<EOS>
a
very
confused
recollection

had
kept

”The
butcher
looked
confused
,

then
in
his
peculiar
elegantphraseology
he
asked
Britton
what
the
h

he
meant

<EOS>
“What

do
I
mean

said
Britton
;
“
why

I

up

a

”“Oh

said
the
butcher
,
“
I
suppose
he
gave

seemed
struck
with

truth
of
this
remark

hetook
another
huge
draught
of
liquor
before
he
replied,—“That

the

,

”“Come

”
cried
Britton
;
“

what
you
have
to
do
.
<EOS>
Follow

and
surely

and
bring

Then

—
hurrah!”“A

d
fool

”
<EOS>
muttered
the
butcher
,
as
he
immersed
a
considerableportion
of
his
immense
red
face
in
the
bowl
of
liquor
before
him
,
nortook
it
out
while
there
was
a
drain
left
.
<EOS>
The
bar
was
not
half
-
a
-
dozen
paces
from
the
door
of
the
room
in
whichAndrew
Britton
and
Bond
had
been
sitting
,
and
half
drunk
as
the
smithwas
,
he
fancied
,
when
he
had
his
hand
upon
the
door
,
that
he
heard
thescuffling
of
some
one
’s
feet
running
away
from
it
.
<EOS>
This
circumstanceraised
his
ire
wonderfully
,
and
the
suspicion
it
gave
rise
to
,
that
thelandlord
was
playing
the
spy
upon
him
,
nearly
choked
him
with
rage
.
<EOS>
He
paused
a
moment
and
glanced
towards
the
bar
,
but
no
one
was
to
beseen
by
the
lamp
which
cast
a
tolerable
light
over
the
many
bottles
andbright
measures
there
collected
.
<EOS>
Britton
muttered
a
curse
,
and
wasabout
to
pass
on
towards
the
staircase
,
when
he
saw
from
the
other
sideof
the
bar
a
head
slowly
rise
and
then
suddenly
pop
down
again
.
<EOS>
An
exclamation
of
anger
was
upon
his
lips
,
but
he
repressed
it
,
and
astrong
desire
to
perpetrate
some
practical
joke
upon
the
landlord
forhis
cunning
propensities
occurred
to
him
.
<EOS>
After
a
few
moments
’
thought
,
he
returned
to
the
room
he
had
just
left
,
and
arming
himself
with
amassive
poker
,
he
winked
mysteriously
at
the
butcher
,
who
followed
himin
silent
amazement
,
wondering
against
whom
the
powerful
weapon
wasabout
to
be
used
.
<EOS>
When
Britton
reached
the
bar
,
he
placed
his
finger
on
his
lips
,
as
aninvocation
to
Bond
to
keep
silence
,
and
then
he
stationed
himself
withthe
poker
in
such
a
position
,
that
if
the
head
should
protrude
again
,
he
could
by
a
lateral
sweep
of
the
heavy
bar
of
iron
,
for
such
if
was
,
make
sure
of
dealing
upon
it
a
tolerable
rap
.
<EOS>
In
point
of
fact
,
the
landlord
had
been
listening
to
the
dialoguebetween
Britton
and
his
friend
,
the
butcher
,
and
then
had
scamperedinto
his
own
bar
,
and
with
an
excess
of
cunning
for
which
there
was
nosort
of
occasion
,
had
stooped
down
behind
his
own
bar
,
where
he
mighthave
showed
himself
boldly
,
with
far
less
suspicion
attached
to
him
.
<EOS>
Britton
had
taken
his
measures
well
,
for
in
less
than
a
minute
<EOS>
the
topof
the
landlord
<EOS>
’s
head
appeared
,
but
before
his
eyes
got
to
the
levelof
the
bar
,
the
smith
dealt
what
there
was
of
his
head
such
a
terriblethwack
with
the
poker
,
that
he
fell
down
in
the
bar
with
a
deep
groan
.
<EOS>
Britton
’s
<EOS>
delight
at
this
achievement
knew
no
bounds
,
and
withoutcaring
in
the
least
whether
the
landlord
’s
skull
was
fractured
or
not
,
he
sat
down
on
the
stairs
and
laughed
till
the
tears
ran
down
hischeeks
.
<EOS>
“Here
,
”
he
then
cried
to
the
butcher
,
“
take
this
back
,
”
throwing
thepoker
to
him
,
which
Bond
caught
very
dexterously
in
one
of
his
immensehands
.
<EOS>
“
I
have
n’t
been
so
amused
for
a
long
time
;
keep
watch
,
and
I’llsend
the
fellow
down
stairs
in
a
minute
.
<EOS>
”“That
<EOS>
Britton
is
certainly
a
clever
man
in
some
things
,
”
remarked
thebutcher
,
quite
confidently
to
himself
,
as
he
lit
his
pipe
calmly
by
thelamp
.
<EOS>
Britton
was
in
a
remarkably
good
humour
as
he
ascended
the
staircase
toliberate
Jacob
Gray
,
who
,
he
had
not
the
least
idea
,
had
made
hisescape
in
the
manner
we
have
related
.
<EOS>
He
had
had
plenty
of
drink
,
JacobGray
,
as
he
imagined
,
was
in
his
power
,
and
he
had
been
just
mostamazingly
amused
by
the
little
affair
of
the
poker
.
<EOS>
“Who
says
Andrew
Britton
is
a
fool
and
a
thick
-
headed
brute
?
”
<EOS>
hemuttered
as
he
ascended
the
stairs
;
“
I
will
be
one
too
many
for
cunningclever
Jacob
Gray
yet
.
<EOS>
I
have
him
now
safe
—
I
have
him
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
escapeme
—
though
what
the
devil
brought
him
here
,
I
ca
n’t
guess
.
<EOS>
That
’s
all
alie
about
coming
here
to
warn
me
of
anything
;
he
must
have
been
set
onto
watch
me
by
Learmont
,
and
yet
would
he
venture
?
<EOS>
I
must
make
him
tellme
before
he
goes
.
<EOS>
”Britton
paused
a
moment
and
took
a
clasped
knife
from
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
Thenhe
added
,
<EOS>
coolly,—“I’ll
cut
off
one
of
his
ears
if
he
do
n’t
tell
exactly
what
brought
himhere
.
<EOS>
Besides
that
,
it
will
be
a
good
plan
,
for
he
’ll
then
beidentified
wherever
he
goes
.
<EOS>
”Britton
stopped
at
the
door
of
the
attic
to
laugh
before
he
unlocked
it
.
<EOS>
“Jacob
is
in
a
horrid
fright
—
<EOS>
I’m
<EOS>
sure
he
is
,
”
he
muttered
;
“
d
—
<EOS>
n
me
,
I’ll
—
<EOS>
I’ll
alarm
him
a
bit
.
<EOS>
”Britton
applied
his
mouth
to
the
key
-
hole
,
and
made
an
unearthly
kindof
noise
,
that
had
Jacob
Gray
been
there
,
would
have
gone
far
towardsfrightening
him
into
fits
.
<EOS>
Then
he
dealt
the
door
a
bang
with
hisfists
,
that
made
the
whole
attic
shake
again
.
<EOS>
“He
<EOS>
’s
<EOS>
half
dead
,
I
know
he
is
,
”
he
cried
;
“
upon
my
word
I
have
n’t
hadsuch
a
pleasant
evening
for
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
smith
then
,
after
several
efforts
,
for
he
was
not
in
the
steadiestcondition
,
succeeded
in
unlocking
the
door
.
<EOS>
There
burnt
the
light
,
nearly
expiring
,
and
Jacob
Gray
was
gone
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
Britton
could
scarcely
believe
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
He
then
rushed
tothe
open
window
,
and
the
truth
flashed
across
his
mind
.
<EOS>
After
all
JacobGray
had
escaped
him
.
<EOS>
A
torrent
of
curses
burst
from
his
lips
,
and
hesunk
upon
a
chair
quite
exhausted
by
his
ungovernable
passion

CHAPTER
LXXVIII.Gray
on
the
House
Tops.—Specimens
of
the
Rising
Generation.—The
OldAttic
.
<EOS>
Gray
’s
situation
on
the
house
tops
was
as
far
from
being
safe
as
it
wasfar
from
pleasant
,
for
the
rapidly
advancing
daylight
<EOS>
,
he
feltconscious
,
would
very
soon
make
him
a
prominent
object
to
the
wholeliberty
of
Westminster
,
if
he
found
not
some
means
of
descending
.
<EOS>
His
standing
upon
the
parapets
,
and
in
the
gutters
,
along
which
hecrawled
,
was
insecure
in
the
extreme
,
and
his
nervousness
,
fromrepeated
slips
which
nearly
precipitated
him
into
the
street
,
increasedeach
moment
,
so
that
he
began
to
feel
that
,
unless
he
got
refugespeedily
somewhere
,
he
should
meet
with
a
fatal
and
disastrousaccident
.
<EOS>
His
idea
was
to
get
in
at
some
attic
window
,
and
so
make
hisway
into
the
street
through
the
house
;
but
this
,
although
the
onlypossible
means
that
he
could
think
of
,
for
rescuing
him
from
his
veryprecarious
situation
,
was
fraught
with
dangers
and
difficulties
;
forwho
would
allow
a
man
to
get
in
at
an
attic
window
,
and
walkundisturbed
through
their
house
into
the
street?Jacob
Gray
,
groaned
as
he
thought
of
this
,
and
wrung
his
hands
indespair
.
<EOS>
“
I
can
not
fight
my
way
out
,
”
he
muttered
.
<EOS>
“
There
is
but
oneremote
chance
for
me
,
and
that
is
to
get
into
some
house
where
thereare
no
men
.
<EOS>
I
may
succeed
in
alarming
females
,
so
that
they
may
be
gladto
<EOS>
let
me
go
in
peace
,
but
what
a
slender
hope
is
that
.
”“There
<EOS>
he
goes
!
<EOS>
“
shouted
a
baker
’s
boy
at
this
moment
,
looking
up
andpointing
at
Gray
,
who
nearly
fell
into
the
street
with
the
suddennessof
the
alarm
.
<EOS>
Several
chance
passengers
now
stopped
,
and
pointed
Gray
out
to
others;so
that
his
situation
was
becoming
every
moment
more
precarious
.
<EOS>
“Stop
thief
!
<EOS>
There
he
goes
!
”
<EOS>
shouted
the
boy
again
,
setting
down
hisbasket
of
bread
,
and
resolved
,
as
boys
always
are
under
suchcircumstances
,
to
see
the
affair
out
.
<EOS>
“Who
is
it
?
”
<EOS>
cried
several
.
<EOS>
“Guy
Fawkes
,
”
said
the
boy
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
laugh
among
the
crowd
,
which
was
rapidly
increasing
;
andnow
an
old
lady
put
her
head
out
of
the
window
of
the
house
on
theparapet
of
which
was
the
trembling
Jacob
Gray
,
and
inquired
,
in
anangry
tone
<EOS>
,
what
was
the
matter
,
and
particularising
the
baker
’s
<EOS>
boy
asa
young
ruffian
,
wanted
to
know
how
he
had
collected
the
crowd
oppositethe
house
.
<EOS>
The
boy
with
the
peculiar
wit
of
his
“
order
”
placed
his
hand
to
hisear
,
affecting
not
to
have
heard
the
old
lady
,
upon
which
,
to
the
greatamusement
of
the
crowd
,
she
screamed
out—,“Oh
,
you
villain
<EOS>
,
I
heard
you
call
me
a
guy
,
but
I
’ll
speak

<EOS>

<EOS>
”“You’ll
<EOS>
make

,

”
said
the
boy
,
“
if

<EOS>

.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
old
lady
shook
her
fists
at
him
,
and
the
crowd
roared
with
laughter
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
could
see
that
the
mob
was
very
much
amused
at
something
,
but
what
it
could
be
he
had
no
means
of
knowing
,
for
the
same
obstacle
,
in
the
shape
of
a
projecting
parapet
,
which
prevented
the
old
lady
fromseeing
him
,
also
prevented
him
from
seeing
her
.
<EOS>
He
endeavoured
to
crawlround
an
angle
of
a
roof
and
escape
,
observation
while
the
altercationwas
going
on
;
but
neither
the
baker
’s
boy
nor
a
sweep
who
had
joinedhis
persecutors
,
would
permit
such
a
thing
for
a
moment
,
and
they
atonce
called
out,—“There
<EOS>
he
goes
—
<EOS>
there
he
goes!”“What
<EOS>
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
”
screamed
the
old
lady
to
the
sweep
.
<EOS>
“There
’s
a
poll
parrot
,
mum
,
<EOS>
a
-
top
o
’
your
house
,
”
replied
the
sweep
.
<EOS>
“A
what
?
”
<EOS>
screamed
she
leaning
as
far
out
of
the
window
as
she
could
,
and
looking
up
.
<EOS>
“Mind
yer
eye
,
mum
,
”
shrieked
the
baker
’s
boy
,
and
amid
a
perfect
roarof
laughter
,
the
old
lady
withdrew
her
head
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
“You
—
<EOS>
you
little
abominable
miscreant
,
”
she
cried
,
“
I
’ll
come
down
<EOS>
toyou!”“Thank
you
,
mum
.
”“There
<EOS>
’s
a
man
on
the
roof
,
”
said
some
one
near
.
<EOS>
“A
<EOS>
man?”“Yes
;
just
on
the
corner
of
the
parapet
.
”“Preserve
<EOS>
us
,
”
cried
the
old
lady
,
leaning
out
of
the
window
again
andlooking
.
<EOS>
“Lean
out
as
far
as
you
can
,
mum
,
”
cried
the
sweep
.
<EOS>
“I
am
,
”
said
the
old
lady
.
<EOS>
“A
<EOS>
little
further
,
then
,
and
you
’ll
see
him
.
<EOS>
”Here
<EOS>
was
another
laugh
,
and
Jacob
Gray
,
with
a
great
effort
,
<EOS>
succeededin
turning
the
corner
of
the
roof
just
as
the
old
lady
produced
atremendous
rattle
,
which
she
began
springing
violently
at
the
window
,
to
the
rapturous
delight
of
the
crowd
below
.
<EOS>
“He
<EOS>
’s
gone
into
Smith
-
street
,
”
cried
several
of
the
throng
,
and
a
rushround
the
corner
was
made
to
keep
Jacob
Gray
in
sight
.
<EOS>
When
he
got
round
the
corner
of
the
roof
which
had
cost
him
so
muchtrouble
,
the
first
thing
that
poor
Jacob
Gray
did
was
to
fall
over
apail
that
was
set
out
at
an
attic
window
,
into
a
dirty
drain
full
ofblack
slimy
mud
,
interspersed
here
and
there
with
delicate
streaks
ofgreen
and
blue
.
<EOS>
When
he
recovered
from
the
shock
of
his
fall
,
his
firstthought
was
to
rise
as
quickly
as
possible
,
but
his
second
was
to
liewhere
he
was
,
as
by
so
doing
he
was
hidden
by
the
parapet
from
the
gazeof
those
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
But
Jacob
Gray
was
not
at
all
aware
of
the
ready
invention
and
cunningof
boys
in
the
streets
of
London
,
and
it
was
with
a
curse
that
,
ifcurses
were
effective
as
implements
of
death
would
have
destroyed
boththe
sweep
and
the
baker
’s
<EOS>
boy
<EOS>
he
heard
the
latter
suggest,—“Oh
<EOS>
,
he
is
in
the
drain
—
<EOS>
I
know
he
is
—
give
us
a
stone
,
and
I
’ll
hit
him
.
<EOS>
”“If
<EOS>
ever
,
”
muttered
Gray
,
“
I
come
across
you
,
and
I
shall
know
yourconfounded
cracked
voice
again
,
I
’ll
wring
your
neck
.
<EOS>
”The
words
were
scarcely
out
of
his
mouth
,
when
a
good
-
sized
stone
camedown
upon
him
with
a
very
disagreeable
plump
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
thrown
by
theboy
with
that
accuracy
that
boys
acquire
in
throwing
stones
from
theabundance
of
practice
that
they
have
in
that
polite
accomplishment
.
<EOS>
“Well
,
my
covey
,
did
it
hit
you
?
”
<EOS>
cried
the
boy
then
in
a
veryinsulting
tone
.
<EOS>
Gray
looked
up
from
among
the
mud
,
and
he
saw
that
the
attic
window
wasopen
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
low
,
and
he
thought
he
might
crawl
in
without
beingseen
;
at
all
events
it
was
better
than
being
pelted
with
stones
in
agutter,—and
having
satisfied
himself
that
the
attic
was
empty
,
hepartially
rose
from
the
gutter
,
and
had
the
satisfaction
,
such
as
itwas
,
of
gliding
over
the
window
-
sill
without
being
seen
.
<EOS>
This
was
one
object
gained
at
all
events
,
and
he
stood
the
picture
ofmisery
and
wretchedness
,
gazing
around
him
upon
the
scantily
furnishedroom
,
in
which
there
was
nothing
but
a
small
bed
made
upon
a
board
laidacross
trussels
,
and
one
rickety
chair
.
<EOS>
Exhausted
,
dispirited
,
and
weak
,
Jacob
Gray
sat
down
upon
the
chair
,
but
it
seemed
as
if
in
small
matters
as
well
as
great
,
the
fates
wouldnever
have
done
persecuting
him
,
for
he
had
not
noticed
that
his
chairwas
minus
a
leg
,
and
the
consequence
was
that
Jacob
Gray
came
down
onthe
floor
with
a
great
noise
,
which
was
more
than
sufficient
to
alarmanybody
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
in
an
agony
of
apprehension
rose
instantly
,
and
flew
to
the
window
,
but
then
the
risk
of
traversing
house
tops
in
broad
daylight
,
which
itnow
very
nearly
was
,
came
across
him
,
and
he
recoiled
from
the
window
,
feeling
that
in
all
probability
,
his
least
danger
lay
in
remainingwhere
he
was
,
and
endeavouring
to
excite
by
some
spurious
tale
thecompassion
of
the
persons
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
His
heart
,
however
,
felt
sick
and
faint
as
he
waited
in
tremblingexpectation
of
some
one
coming
;
and
as
minute
after
minute
rolledonwards
,
leaving
him
still
alone
,
he
felt
it
would
be
a
relief
to
hismind
if
they
would
come
at
once
,
and
not
leave
him
on
the
rack
ofapprehension
.
<EOS>
His
senses
became
powerfully
acute
to
the
least
noise
,
and
once
ortwice
he
fancied
he
heard
a
creaking
noise
upon
the
staircase
,
as
ifsome
one
was
coming
cautiously
up
to
capture
him
.
<EOS>
This
feeling
greweach
moment
until
it
became
awfully
intolerable
,
and
he
trembled
soexcessively
that
he
could
not
,
as
he
wished
open
the
door
to
see
if
anyone
was
upon
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
A
dreadful
apprehension
came
across
his
mind
that
whoever
was
comingmight
be
armed
with
,
perhaps
,
a
blunderbuss
,
which
might
,
on
the
momentof
his
appearance
,
be
discharged
in
his
,
Jacob
Gray
’s
,
face
,
and
sofinish
his
career
at
once
by
a
death
of
agony
.
<EOS>
The
moment
thisapprehension
began
to
haunt
him
he
looked
around
him
for
some
place
oftemporary
concealment
,
and
observing
a
cupboard
at
one
end
of
the
room
,
he
glided
cautiously
towards
it
,
resolving
to
take
refuge
within
ituntil
<EOS>
he
should
hear
,
by
the
voices
of
those
who
might
be
coming
,
whatmight
probably
be
their
station
in
life
and
their
intentions
.
<EOS>
The
cupboard
door
was
only
fastened
with
a
button
,
and
Jacob
Grayturned
cautiously
.
<EOS>
The
door
,
from
the
pressure
of
something
inside
,
immediately
came
wide
open
.
<EOS>
A
cry
of
terror
burst
from
Jacob
Gray
,
as
adead
body
apparently
frightfully
mangled
,
fell
at
his
feet
.

CHAPTER
LXXIX.The
Interview
between
Albert
and
Learmont.—The
Promise
,
and
Albert’sRelation
.
<EOS>
Albert
Seyton
was
punctual
to
his
appointment
with
Learmont
,
and
afterwaiting
for
ten
minutes
,
was
ushered
into
the
small
room
in
which
themiserable
squire
usually
sat
.
<EOS>
Days
seemed
to
be
doing
the
work
of
years
upon
Learmont
.
<EOS>
His
coal
-
blackhair
was
tinged
with
grey
,
and
there
were
deep
furrows
on
his
cheeks
,
which
were
of
that
dead
ashy
-
looking
white
colour
,
if
colour
it
couldbe
called
at
all
,
that
the
former
sallow
tint
of
his
complexion
hadrecently
given
way
to
.
<EOS>
Take
his
appearance
altogether
as
he
there
sat
in
a
chair
,
the
back
ofwhich
was
placed
against
the
wall
with
a
table
and
writing
materialsbefore
him
,
he
looked
a
man
to
be
shunned
or
pitied
,
according
as
theobserver
might
translate
his
looks
to
imply
disease
of
body
,
or
thatworse
disease
of
the
mind
resulting
from
a
perturbed
conscience
.
<EOS>
He
slightly
started
as
Albert
entered
the
room
,
and
then
,
in
reply
tohis
bow
,
he
said
in
a
hollow
voice
,
which
sounded
as
if
it
came
fromthe
lips
of
a
corpse
risen
from
the
grave,—“Good
day
,
young
sir
.
<EOS>
”“Good
day
,
sir
,
”
replied
Albert
.
<EOS>
“
I
am
here
in
obedience
to
yourcommand
.
<EOS>
”“Yes
—
<EOS>
yes
,
”
muttered
Learmont
,
leaning
his
head
upon
his
hand
.
<EOS>
“
You
arehere
,
and
punctual
—
very
punctual
.
”
<EOS>
He
then
seemed
to
fall
into
a
fit
ofabstraction
,
and
added
,
“
He
is
not
here
.
<EOS>
Can
he
have
taken
alarm
?
<EOS>
Or
hewill
be
here
anon?”“Sir
,
”
said
Albert
.
<EOS>
Learmont
started
,
exclaiming,—“Who
spoke?”“I
thought
you
addressed
me
,
sir?”“No
—
no
<EOS>
—
I
—
I
—
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
You
are
very
young
,
and
yet
have
knowntrouble
,
you
say?”“There
has
been
much
trouble
,
sir
,
crowded
into
the
brief
space
of
myexistence
,
”
replied
Albert
.
<EOS>
“
I
have
lost
all
that
I
loved
.
<EOS>
”“All
?
”
echoed
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“Yes
,
sir
,
all
,
”
sighed
Albert
.
<EOS>
“You
have
no
ties
then
to
bind
you
to
the
world
,
and
make
you
pause
inany
undertaking
?
<EOS>
You
are
like
me
,
a
lone
man
.
<EOS>
I
am
lone
,
and
quitedesolate
;
but
I
pride
myself
upon
my
isolation
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
besurrounded
by
what
the
mass
of
mankind
rejoice
in
,
in
the
shape
ofconnexions
,
for
worlds
.
<EOS>
”Albert
said
nothing
,
and
,
after
a
pause
,
Learmont
added
,
hastily,—“You
bear
in
mind
our
conversation
of
yesterday?”“I
<EOS>
do
,
sir
,
and
am
ready
to
perform
the
honourable
service
youmentioned
to
me
.
<EOS>
”Albert
laid
some
stress
upon
the
word
honourable
,
and
Learmont
replied
,
coldly,—“Well
,
sir
,
it
is
honourable
service
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
know
it
is
,
sir
.
<EOS>
”“You
know
it
is
.
<EOS>
”“Yes
<EOS>
,
sir
—
I
know
it
is
so
,
or
,
as
the
son
of
a
soldier
and
a
gentleman
,
I
should
never
have
had
it
proposed
to
me
by
you
.
<EOS>
”A
<EOS>
sneer
passed
over
Learmont
’s
face
as
he
said,—“My
young
friend
,
soldiers
,
and
gentlemen
,
and
their
sons
,
are
not
allas
particular
as
you
.
<EOS>
”“I
am
sorry
for
it
,
sir
.
<EOS>
”“Nay
,
why
should
you
be
?
<EOS>
Among
stars
would
you
not
wish
to
shine
thebrightest
?
’
<EOS>
Tis
<EOS>
well
that
some
soldiers
and
gentlemen
are
not
so
veryscrupulous
;
for
do
n’t
you
see
,
young
sir
,
that
it
makes
your
greatvirtue
shine
with
double
lustre
.
<EOS>
”Albert
<EOS>
did
not
wholly
relish
the
tone
of
irony
in
which
this
was
said
,
and
his
cheek
slightly
flushed
as
he
replied,—“It
were
unbecoming
in
me
to
dispute
with
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
”There
was
a
silence
of
some
moments
’
duration
,
and
then
Learmont
said
,
abruptly,—“You
will
follow
the
man
home
upon
whose
track
I
will
put
you
.
<EOS>
Awakenin
his
mind
no
shadow
of
doubt
,
or
all
—
I
—
I
mean
much
is
lost
.
<EOS>
He
iscrafty
;
but
bear
this
in
mind
through
life
—
to
outwit
the
crafty
,
youhave
but
to
be
simple
.
<EOS>
”“I
will
do
my
best
,
sir
.
”“Do
<EOS>
so
,
and
your
reward
will
be
commensurate
with
your
deserts
.
<EOS>
Surelyhe
will
come
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
hope
you
will
find
him
honester
than
you
suppose
him
to
be,”remarked
Albert
.
<EOS>
“You
hope
I
may
find
him
honest
!
<EOS>
May
all
the
torments
of
hell
consumehim!”“Sir?”“I
—
I
do
n’t
mean
him
.
<EOS>
No
matter
—
I
am
not
quite
well
.
<EOS>
Young
man
,
beware
,
whatever
you
may
see
,
hear
,
or
surmise
in
this
house
,
must
remainlocked
in
your
own
heart
.
<EOS>
”“Sir
<EOS>
,
”
said
Albert
shrinking
from
the
basilisk
glance
of
Learmont
,
<EOS>
“
myduty
is
simple
.
<EOS>
I
have
but
to
obey
your
honourable
orders
,
and
I
shalldo
so
to
the
utmost
of
my
humble
ability
.
<EOS>
It
were
,
indeed
,
a
poorreturn
for
your
kindness
to
me
,
to
babble
of
you
or
your
affairs
.
<EOS>
”“Well
,
so
it
would
—
<EOS>
you
are
right
there
,
”
said
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“
I
would
fainbind
you
to
me
and
my
interests
by
kindness
—
such
substantial
kindnessas
you
would
appreciate
;
and
never
forget
I
am
rich
—
have
some
power
,
and
am
willing
to
use
my
wealth
,
and
exert
my
influence
.
<EOS>
Can
I
serveyou
in
any
matter
?
<EOS>
You
hinted
that
you
had
a
source
of
trouble
.
<EOS>
”Albert
<EOS>
’s
heart
beat
,
tumultuously
at
these
words
,
and
his
first
thoughtwas,—“Will
<EOS>
he
exert
his
wealth
and
influence
in
assisting
me
to
discoverAda?”Learmont
<EOS>
saw
his
agitation
and
said,—“Speak
freely
.
<EOS>
But
should
the
man
whom
I
wish
you
to
follow
arrive
hereduring
our
converse
,
you
must
finish
your
story
another
time
.
<EOS>
I
wishyou
to
speak
freely
,
and
if
I
can
bind
you
to
me

<EOS>
you

I
shall
think

well

<EOS>
”“Sir
<EOS>
,
”
said
Albert
,
“
were
—
were
you
—
you—”“What?”“Ever
in
love
,
sir?”“I
love?—I
in
love?—I?”“Pardon
me
,
sir
,
for
asking
the
question
,
but
the
sadness
that
has
hunglike
a
leaden
weight
upon
my
heart
for
so
long
has
arisen
from
the
deepsympathy
felt
for
the
forlorn
condition
of
one
who
even
then
seemed
bysome
mysterious
influence
,
creeping
around
my
heart
.
<EOS>
”Learmont
<EOS>
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
a
slight
yawn
,
but
Albert
wastoo
much
interested
in
his
own
subject
to
notice
the
contemptuousimpatience
of
his
auditor
.
<EOS>
“When
my
poor
father
died
<EOS>
,
”
he
continued
,
“
I
felt
great
grief
;
but
thatwas
a
grief
that
time
would
assuage
.
<EOS>
It
left
nothing
to
the
imaginationto
work
upon
,
and
continue
building
up
unavailing
sorrow
.
<EOS>
On
thecontrary
,
when
the
first
shock
of
parting
with
those
we
love
—
when
deathhas
robbed
us
of
them
,
is
over
,
and
when
reason
resumes
her
reign
—
weshould
rejoice
that
they
have
left
such
fleeting
and
uncertain
joys
asthis
world
affords
for
that
which
is
eternal
and
knows
no
change
;
butwhere
I
loved
,
where
I
gave
my
whole
heart
’s
affection
,
sir

thereindeed
I
have
much
cause
for
sorrow
,
and
there
is
far
too
ample
foodfor
dreamy
fancy
to
work
upon
.
<EOS>
”“Indeed
<EOS>
,
”
said
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
fear
I
tire
you
,
sir

<EOS>
”“Not
at

not

<EOS>
”“A
considerable
time
since
,
sir
,
and
I
believe
before
your
worship
cameto
London
,
my
father
and
I
lodged
in
a
mean
house
not
very
far
fromhere
,
for
we
were
poor

<EOS>
My

was
waiting
for
his
just
remunerationfor
services
rendered

ungrateful
people

<EOS>
I
was

a
boy

butfrom
the
time

my
residence

I
may
date
thecommencement
of
a
love
which
,
although
I
knew
not
then
its
existence
,
became
a
part
of
my
nature

and
will
accompany

”“Oh
,

said
Learmont
.
<EOS>
Then
he
muttered
to
himself
,
“
what
can
detainJacob
Gray?”Albert
continued:—“In
<EOS>
the
same
house
,
sir
,
lodged
a
strangely
matched
couple
.
<EOS>
The
one
wasa
man
of
wily
and
sinister
aspect
,
ever
crawling
instead
ofwalking
—
insinuating
,
rather
than
saying
,
what
he
wished
to
convey
—
a
manthat
had
villain
stamped
upon
,
his
face
.
<EOS>
”“I
rather
think
,
”
said
Learmont
,
“
I
could
match
you
such
a
man

<EOS>
”“Let
<EOS>
us
hope
,
sir
<EOS>
,
there
are
few
such

”
added
Albert
,
“
but
of
such
acharacter
was
he
,
who
daily
slunk
in
and
out
of
this
house
,
livingapparently
in
great
poverty
.
<EOS>
With
him
dwelt
a
young
girl
.
”“Ah

”
thought
Learmont
,
“
love
and
poverty
,
the
old
story
.
”“Oh
<EOS>
,
sir

she
was
beautiful

beautiful
as
Heaven

her
face
was
as
aspeaking
mirror
in
which
you
might
read
all
the
pure
and
noble
feelingsof
her
soul

<EOS>
She
must
have
been
of
noble
and
high
origin
,
for
the
seedsof
every
high
virtue
were
implanted
in
her
breast

forth

beauty

<EOS>
”“The
soft
blush

Her
brow

rivalled
the

her
mouth—”“You

said
Learmont

with
aslight
tone
of
impatience.—“I

”“I

your

she
may

alas

<EOS>
I
scarcely
knowin
what
direction
to
commence
the
search

<EOS>
”“Did
<EOS>
you
<EOS>
we
d
<EOS>
her?”“No
,
sir
;
had
I
done
so
,
a
world
in
arms
should
not
have
separated
us
.
<EOS>
”“The
father
then
,
I
presume
,
was
adverse
to
your
suit?”“She
had
no
father

sir

no
mother

no

me

I
left

her
more

never!”“Go
on
with
your

”“He
<EOS>
who
was
with
her

held
her
in

a
mysteriousman

often

some
great
crime
weighed
heavily

”“Perhaps

said
Learmont

in
a
hollow
voice

<EOS>
“
Perhaps
so

Learmont

“Time

she
bore
with
much

continued
Albert,“connected

was
that

cry
arose
from

startled
Albert

with
pale

ghastly

the

stoodopposite

glaring
in

CHAPTER
LXXX.The
<EOS>
Unfortunate
Confidence
of
Albert
Seyton.—Learmont
<EOS>
’s
<EOS>
Promises
andTreachery
.
<EOS>
When
Albert
Seyton
got
near
the
door
,
Learmont
cried
in
a
harsh
voice,—“Stop
,
stop—’twas
<EOS>
only
a
passing
spasm
,
I
am
subject
to
them
,
verysubject
to

.
<EOS>
Come
back
,
young
sir
,
come
back
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
reeled
a
step
or
two
as
he
spoke
,
and
then
sunk
into
a
chair
,
muttering,—“I
—
I
have
not
strength
now
to
bear
me
up
against
these
suddensurprises
.
<EOS>
Can
it
be
really
he
,
and
<EOS>
I
,
listening
with
so
muchindifference
to
what
touched
me
so
nearly
,
and
yet
it
can
not
be
—
I
darenot
question
him
.
<EOS>
”“Are
you
better
,
sir
?
”
said
Albert
.
<EOS>
“Yes
—
<EOS>
yes
,
better
now
.
<EOS>
Ring
yon
bell
,
and
order
wine
.
<EOS>
”Albert
rung
a
lusty
peal
upon
the
bell
,
and
an
attendant
promptlyanswered
the
summons
,
standing
respectfully
for
orders
.
<EOS>
Learmont
rose
and
approached
the
man
,
who
became
evidently
muchfrightened
lest
his
imperious
master
was
for
some
real
or
imaginedfault
going
to
execute
summary
vengeance
upon
him
.
<EOS>
“Mercy
,
sir
,
your
worship
,
”
he
cried
.
<EOS>
“Fool
!
<EOS>
”
growled
Learmont
,
as
he
reached
the
door
;
and
then
inclininghis
head
close
to
the
man
<EOS>
’s
ear
he
said;—“If
Jacob
Gray
should
comewhile
this
young
gentleman
is
with
me
,
<EOS>
show
him
into
a
room
,
but
do
notannounce
him
.
<EOS>
”“Yes
,
yes

<EOS>
”“Make
<EOS>
no

<EOS>
I
will
have

<EOS>
”“No

<EOS>
no

no

I
wo

any
mistake
,
I

,
and
begone
,
”
cried
Learmont
,
in
a
loud
voice
,
and
the
manprecipitately
retired
in
a
great
fright
.
<EOS>
“Oh
!
<EOS>
I
forgot
the
wine
,
”
said
Learmont
,
as
he
turned
from
the
door,“ring
again
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
”Albert
<EOS>
rung
,
and
with
a
pale
face
the
servant
just
came
to
thethreshold
of
the
door
.
<EOS>
“Wine
,
”
cried
Learmont
,
and
the
man
disappeared
immediately
with
ajerk
,
as
if
he
had
been
pulled
away
by
some
wire
.
<EOS>
“You
will
continue
your
narration
,
”
said
Learmont
,
trying
to
impartsome
moisture
to
his
parched
lips—“you
—
you
—
named
Gray
,
I
think
,
as
theman
’s
<EOS>
name?”“I
did
,
sir
—
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
”Learmont
was
prepared
for
this
,
and
he
only
gave
a
slight
start
,
as
thefamiliar
name
came
upon
his
ears
.
<EOS>
“
Go
on
—
go
on
,
”
he
said
.
<EOS>
“I
was
about
to
tell
you
that
he
kept
a
mysterious
written
paper
in
hisroom
,
addressed
on
the
outside
to
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
themagistrate
.
”“Addressed
<EOS>
on
the
outside
to
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
the
magistrate,”muttered
Learmont—“then
,
then
,
it
was
true
.
<EOS>
”“Sir!”“Go
<EOS>
on
—
go
on
.
<EOS>
”“This
<EOS>
paper
he
always
charged
his
young
and
beautiful
companion
torepair
with
herself
to
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
<EOS>
should
he
on
any
occasionnot
return
or
send
to
her
within
three
clear
days
of
the
time
he
hadlimited
his
absence
to
extend
to
.
”“Indeed
.
’
<EOS>
Twas
very
strange
.
”“It
<EOS>
was
,
sir
,
and
I
always
believed
that
the
paper
contained
someparticulars
concerning
the
gentle
girl
he
had
held
in
such
cruel
andunjustifiable
bondage
.
<EOS>
”“No
<EOS>
doubt
—
no
doubt
<EOS>
;
well
what
happened
next
?
<EOS>
Go
on
.
<EOS>
”“From
<EOS>
that
place
one
day
they
mysteriously
removed
,
leaving
behind
themonly
an
old
trunk
in
which
this
strange
paper
used
to
be
kept
,
and
itwas
long
ere
<EOS>
I
saw
them
again
.
<EOS>
”“But
<EOS>
you
did!”“I
did
,
sir
—
I
should
,
however
,
have
informed
you
of
anothercircumstance
,
but
I
fear
,
sir
,
I
weary
you
—
you
are
not
well
,
sir
.
<EOS>
”“Yes
,
yes
—
quite
well
.
<EOS>
”“Some
<EOS>
other
time
when
you
may
feel
disposed
to
listen
to
me
,
sir
—
I—”“Go
on
,
now
—
go
on
—
it
amuses
me
much
—
very
much
—
<EOS>
I
have
not
been
sointerested
in
anything
for
a
long
time
—
I
beg
you
will
go
on
.
<EOS>
”“You
are
very
kind
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Then
as
I
was
saying
I
forgot
to
tell
you
thatthis
young
girl
was
,
when
I
first
knew
her
,
disguised
in
the
dress
of
aboy
,
and
called
Harry
Gray
.
”“Disguised
<EOS>
as
a
boy?—Humph
—
An
artful
,
very
cunning
trick
.
<EOS>
”“Yes
,
<EOS>
sir
,
but
objectless
surely
—
I
thought
her
a
boy
,
and
then
she
wasbeautiful
,
and
I
could
have
lived
or
died
for
Harry
Gray
,
but
whenafter
<EOS>
that
,
I
saw
her
in
the
clothing
more
becoming
to
her
sex
,
andknew
her
as
my
own
beautiful
Ada
<EOS>
,
how
different
were
my
feelings
—
<EOS>
Ipassionately
loved
her
.
<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
she?”“Returned
my
heart
’s
devotion
with
all
the
frankness
of
her
noblenature
.
”“Where
<EOS>
was
she
<EOS>
when
you
saw
her
last?”“I
met
her
in
St.
James
’s
Park
—
she
had
fled
from
the
house
to
whichthis
man
Gray
had
hurried
her
,
and
where
he
had
kept
her
a
closeprisoner
for
a
weary
space
of
time
.
<EOS>
Then
I
madly
parted
with
her
,
as
Ithought
but
for
an
hour
,
and
I
have
never
seen
her
since
.
<EOS>
”“Where
<EOS>
was
the
house?”“A
ruined
condemned
house
by
South
Lambeth
—
a
wretched
den
.
<EOS>
”Learmont
drew
a
long
breath
,
as
he
said,—“You
say
she
has
escaped
fromhim
?
<EOS>
How
was
that?”“Some
men
had
sought
his
life
,
she
told
me
,
and
he
had
assured
her
thathis
only
chance
of
preservation
lay
in
their
not
finding
her
with
him;and
moreover
,
as
they
supposed
her
a
boy
,
she
might
escape
and
sopreserve
herself
and
him
by
attiring
herself
in
the
proper
habilimentsof
her
sex
.
<EOS>
”“Yes
—
<EOS>
yes
—
she
did?”“She
did
,
sir
,
on
the
mere
doubt
that
he
might
be
her
father
.
”“Well
?
<EOS>
And
after
that?”“After
that
I
never
saw
her
.
<EOS>
I
have
searched
in
every
place
in
London
.
<EOS>
I
have
wearied
myself
with
a
long
and
useless
hunt
.
<EOS>
I
have
inquireduntil
<EOS>
I
met
with
insolence
from
some
,
and
mockery
from
others
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
sir
,
if
indeed
you
will
aid
me
in
this
matter
,
I
do
,
from
my
heart
,
<EOS>
believethat
while
you
make
two
beings
happy
who
will
ever
bless
your
name,—youwill
likewise
be
unmasking
some
monstrous
villany
which
this
man
JacobGray
has
been
concerned
in
.
”“Bless
<EOS>
my
name
,
”
muttered
Learmont
,
with
a
shudder
.
<EOS>
“With
your
means
,
and
your
influence
with
the
authorities
,
we
mustsurely
succeed

”
continued
Albert
.
<EOS>
“
Oh
,
then
,
sir
,
consider
what
aglorious
reflection
it
will
be
to
you
to
see
our
happiness
,
and
tellyourself
that

all

<EOS>
”“The

the

<EOS>

said
the
trembling
servant
,
coming
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
Learmont
motioned
it
to
be
laid
before
him
,
and
then
filled
a
bumperthat
quite
astonished
Albert
,
and
tossed
it
off
at
one
draught
.
<EOS>
“Drink
,
”
he
said
,
as
he
pushed
a
decanter
across
the
table
to
Albert
.
<EOS>
“It
will
raise
your
spirits
to
tell
me
the
remainder
of
your
strangeeventful
story
.
<EOS>
”Albert
drank
a
small
quantity
of
the
generous
fluid
,
and
then
he
said,—“I
have
nearly
told
you
all
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Everything
else
with
me
must
beconjecture
.
<EOS>
I
should
,
however
,
mention
that
I
called
upon
Sir
FrancisHartleton
,
with
the
hope
of
interesting
him
in
the
affair
,
but
he
tookbut
little
heed
of
it
.
<EOS>
”“Indeed!”“Yes
<EOS>
;
he
was
but
lukewarm
as
regarded
all
I
told
him
,
and
I
believe
didnothing
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
yet
you
told
him
all
you
have
related
to
me
,
”
said
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“All
,
sir
;
but
there
are
some
men
who
will
not
step
out
of
the
beatentrack
of
their
duty
for
any
consideration
.
<EOS>
”“True
,
true
,
Mr.
Seyton

<EOS>
I
believe
this
man
to
be
an
overpraised
man

<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
am
<EOS>
far
from
having
the
high
opinion
of
him

seems
to
haveobtained
from
most
persons

<EOS>
I
should
advise
you
to
shun

<EOS>
Do
notcall
upon
him
;
and
,
should
you
even
by
chance
meet
him
,
avoid
anyconversation
concerning
this
matter

<EOS>
I
am
chary
of
interfering
withmen
’s
reputation
,
but
I
know
sufficient
of
this
Sir
Francis
Hartletonto
beware
of
him
as
a
hollow
friend

<EOS>
”“In
<EOS>
truth
,
sir
<EOS>
,
I
believe
,
”
said
Albert
,
“
that
I
shall
have
but
littletrouble
in
shunning

denied
admittance

since

interview

<EOS>
”“Ay

He

was
difficulty

danger

no

you

Improved

Prospects.—The

Recollections.—TheMeeting
.
<EOS>
When
Learmont
was
once
more
left
alone
,
a
dark
scowl
of
triumph
cameover
his
face
,
and
he
breathed
more
freely
than
he
had
done
for
many
aday
.
<EOS>
“So
,
”
he
said
“
many
mysteries
are
suddenly
cleared
up
now
;
I
—
<EOS>
I
ammyself
again
.
<EOS>
A
weight
is
lifted
off
my
heart
.
<EOS>
Several
things
are
nowclear
and
plain
to
me
that
I
have
been
tortured
with
for
many
days
.
<EOS>
This
being
who
has
been
my
bane
,
and
is
now
my
greatest
danger
,
is
agirl
,
and
not
a
boy
,
as
Jacob
Gray
would
always
fain
have
made
methink
.
<EOS>
He
has
lost
her
too
;
and
it
must
have
been
she
whom
I
saw
at
mydoor
step
and
at
the
window
of
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
.
<EOS>
So
far
all
isclear
;
and
Gray
’s
confused
manner
,
wretched
appearance
,
and
offer
tocompromise
with
me
when
last
we
met
are
now
accounted
for
.
<EOS>
He
has
losthis
great
stronghold
upon
me
,
losing
the
child
of
—
of
<EOS>
—
I
can
not
name
him
.
<EOS>
No
—
no
—
his
name
shall
never
pass
my
lips
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
rose
and
paced
the
room
for
a
few
minutes
with
unequal
strides
,
thensuddenly
pausing
,
he
muttered,—“All
must
be
safe
.
<EOS>
This
girl
,
Ada
,
as
she
is
called,—and
now
Irecollect
me
,
it
was
the
name
of
her
mother
<EOS>
—
she
must
know
<EOS>
but
verylittle
,
too
little
evidently
,
to
enable
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
to
annoyme
in
any
way
,
or
he
would
have
swooped
upon
my
devoted
head
like
aneagle
on
its
prey
.
<EOS>
He
may
surmise
much
,
but
he
can
know
nothing
;
andnow
for
some
plan
of
operation
in
which
this
lover
can
play
his
part
,
and
when
all
is
done
,
should
he
suspect
anything
or
prove
troublesome
,
it
is
but
another
deed
,
and
he
is
gone
to
his
last
account
.
<EOS>
He
leavesno
clamouring
confession
behind
him
,
to
enable
him
to
have
a
posthumousrevenge
upon
those
whom
he
hates
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
after
all
my
hopes
and
fears
,
a
greater
triumph
than
any
I
have
experienced
is
at
hand
for
me
.
<EOS>
Mywealth
may
,
after
all
,
insure
me
some

not
all
the

somuch
coveted

I
may
,
really
free

unshackled

panting
soul
has
longed
for

Learmont
gazed
proudly
around
himupon
the

magnificence
that
crowded
his

<EOS>
“I

he
exclaimed
.

”He
<EOS>
hastily
wrapped
himself
in
his
cloak
,
and
with
a
haughtier
stride
,
and
a
prouder
and
more
confident
mien
than
he
had
worn
since
his
firstarrival
in
the
metropolis
<EOS>
,
he
left
his
lordly
home
,
and
took
his
way
tothe
great
mall
of
St.
James
’s
Park
.
<EOS>
Leaving
Learmont
to
pursue
his
walk
,
and
to
congratulate
himself
uponwhat
he
considered
his
improved
prospects
,
we
will
,
with
the
reader’spermission
,
present
ourselves
at
the
breakfast
table
of
Sir
FrancisHartleton
,
where
sat
the
magistrate
himself
,
his
lady
,
and
Ada
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
had
passed
nearly
a
sleepless
night
in
reflecting
,
over
andover
again
,
upon
the
various
circumstances
connected
with
the
fortunesof
his
beautiful
guest
.
<EOS>
His
great
object
was
,
if
possible
,
to
decideupon
some
regular
course
of
action
,
which
might
be
safely
andperseveringly
pursued
with
a
prospect
of
an
ultimate
result
of
asuccessful
nature
.
<EOS>
After
much
thought
,
repugnant
as
he
was
to
any
step
which
savoured
oftrespassing
upon
the
undoubted
rights
of
another
,
he
determinedsecretly
and
quietly
,
unknown
to
every
one
,
to
make
a
visit
to
thevillage
of
Learmont
,
and
explore
the
old
Smithy
,
with
a
faint
hope
thathe
might
find
there
some
indications
of
what
had
occurred
on
thatfearful
night
of
the
storm
and
the
fire
,
which
he
could
never
forget
.
<EOS>
He
had
slept
calmly
after
making
this
resolve
,
and
arose
more
refreshedthan
he
expected
from
the
anxious
night
he
had
passed
,
and
now
hisobject
was
,
before
he
undertook
his
journey
,
to
have
some
conversationwith
Ada
,
in
order
by
leading
her
mind
to
the
occurrences
at
the
OldSmithy
,
to
discover
if
her
memory
,
young
as
she
was
,
retained
anytraces
of
the
event
;
for
that
she
was
the
child
brought
from
theburning
ruins
,
and
that
Jacob
Gray
was
the
man
who
so
brought
her
,
heentertained
but
a
very
faint
doubt
indeed
.
<EOS>
“Ada
,
”
he
said
,
“
does
any
event
of
very
early
life
come
ever
to
yourmemory?”“Since
<EOS>
I
have
been
here
,
”
replied
Ada
,
in
her
clear
and
sweet
liquidtones
,
“
and
so
very
happy
,
it
seems
to
me
as
if
my
mind
had
assimilateditself
to
some
circumstances
that
must
have
happened
long
since
to
me
,
so
long
that
I
can
hardly
believe
that
I
am
now
in
the
same
state
ofexistence
.
<EOS>
Kind
words
seem
now
as
familiar
as
they
are
grateful
to
me
,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
memory
,
wavering
from
the
shock
of
years
ofharshness
and
misery
,
is
beginning
to
pour
forth
the
hidden
stores
andcrushed
remembrances
of
kind
and
gentle
words
,
and
friendly
,
lovingsmiles
which
guided
me
before
I
knew
Jacob
Gray
.
”Lady
<EOS>
Hartleton
could
not
suppress
a
tear
as
Ada
spoke
,
and
Sir
Francislistened
with
eager
pleasure
to
her
words
.
<EOS>
“My
<EOS>
dear
Ada
,
”
he
said
,
“
if
you
will
endeavour
to
tell
me
in
your
owngentle
,
admirable
way
,
what
these
recollections
consist
of
,
they
may
beof
the
greatest
service
in
enabling
me
to
unravel
the
mysteries
thatnow
surround
you
.
”“Sometimes
,
”
said
Ada
,
“
I
fancy
<EOS>
I
recollect
some
one
who
used
to
weepover
me
and
kiss
me
fondly
;
and
when
,
yesterday
,
your
dear
lady,”turning
to
Sir
Francis
<EOS>
’s
wife
,
“
took
me
to
the
ancient
tower
,
it
seemedto
me
that
some
of
the
large
ships
and
the
cries
of
the
seamen
were
notaltogether
strange
to
me
.
”“Do
<EOS>
you
recollect
anything
of
a
fire
?
<EOS>
“
said
the
magistrate
.
<EOS>
“A
fire?”“Yes
—
do
you
ever
recollect
a
fire
,
and
loud
screams
and
much
confusion?”Ada
shuddered
.
<EOS>
”I
have
always
fancied
that
a
dream
,
”
she
said
,
“
but
it
has
haunted
meso
often
that
I
have
feared
to
find
it
real
.
<EOS>
I
have
dreamt
of
a
wild
,
dark
place
,
and
then
bright
flames
have
lit
it
up
,
and
cries
andshrieks
have
filled
the
air
,
and
my
heart
has
sunk
within
me
,
for
itseemed
as
if
some
one
had
torn
me
from
all
I
ever
loved
.
<EOS>
Then
snowwould
dash
in
my
face
,
and
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
I
was
borne
onwards
bysome
one
with
terrific
speed
,
and
such
dreadful
shouts
and
cries
ashave
made
me
awaken
in
horror
,
and
pray
to
Heaven
to
spare
me
suchanother
dream
.
<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
all
this
could
you
never
recognise
any
well
-
knownform
or
face
,
or
familiar
voice?”“None
but
Jacob
Gray
’s
.
<EOS>
His
pale
hideous
face
seemed
ever
turnedtowards
me
,
and
I
used
to
fancy
that
being
in
<EOS>
so
solitary
a
mode
oflife
with
him
,
put
such
fancies
in
my
sleeping
brain
.
<EOS>
”“Well
,
Ada
and
you
,
my
dear
,
”
said
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
“
must
enduremy
absence
from
London
,
I
think
,
for
about
a
week
.
<EOS>
”“A
week
?
”
said
Lady
Hartleton
.
<EOS>
“Yes
,
I
must
endeavour
to
get
leave
to
go
for
that
time
.
<EOS>
It
is
uponbusiness
of
the
utmost
importance

<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
rose
as
he
spoke
,
and
his
wife
looked
at
him
regretfully
,
as
shesaid,—“You
are
not
going
to

day
,
Francis?”“No
,
nor
to

morrow
,
”
he
replied
,
smiling
;
“
and
when
I
do
go
,
I
have
notquite
made
up
my
mind
that
I
shall
not
take
you
both
with
me
.
<EOS>
”“Then
<EOS>
you
may
go
as
soon
as
you
like
,
Francis
,
if
Ada
will
accompanyus
.
<EOS>
”A
<EOS>
tear
started
to
Ada
’s
eye
,
as
she
<EOS>
said,—“What
other
friend
,
save
Heaven
,
have
I
but
you
to
cling
to
now
,
forhe—”She
<EOS>
thought
of
Albert
Seyton
,
and
paused
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
took
her
hand
gently
,
and
said,—“My
dear
Ada
,
I
mean
to
find
Albert
Seyton
,
and
make
him
my
clerk
.
<EOS>
”Ada
looked
up
in
his
face
,
and
thanked
him
by
a
glance
that
spoke
moreeloquently
than
words
could
have
done
.
<EOS>
The
magistrate
then
smiled
anadieu
,
and
left
his
house
to
proceed
to
his
office
by
Buckingham
Houseacross
the
park
.
<EOS>
He
entered
the
park
by
the
back
of
his
house
,
which
,
as
the
reader
isaware
,
opened
into
and
near
to
the
Birdcage

walk
,
and
with
an
easystep
,
for
he
had
plenty
of
time

SirFrancis
walked
on

by

glanced
round

regarding

a
sneer

triumph
sat
upon

CHAPTER
LXXXII.Learmont
<EOS>
’s
<EOS>
Sneers.—The
Spy.—The
Amateur
Constable
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
paused
a
moment
in
doubt
whether
he
should
speakto
the
gloomy
squire
,
whom
he
so
much
suspected
of
many
crimes
,
or
passon
his
way
without
meeting
him
.
<EOS>
Before
,
however
,
he
could
decide
uponany
course
of
action
,
Learmont
settled
the
question
by
walking
up
toHartleton
,
and
saying,—“Good
morning
,
Sir
Magistrate
—
you
are
early
afoot
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
own
Sir
Squire
,
”
said
Hartleton
,
rather
amazed
at
the
confident
toneand
manner
of
Learmont
,
“
my
duties
take
up
as
much
of
my
time
as
otherpeople
’s
crimes
do
theirs
.
<EOS>
”“No
<EOS>
doubt
,
no
doubt
<EOS>
,
”
said
Learmont
;
“
Yours
is
an
onerous
position
.
<EOS>
’Tis
<EOS>
well
criminality
is
not
contagious
,
for
otherwise
,
coming
incontact
with
so
many
troublesome
thieves
,
and
disagreeable
characters
,
London
would
lose
her
fine
-
spirited
,
upright
,
and
noble
magistrate
.
<EOS>
”“You
are
right
,
”
said
Hartleton
,
determined
not
to
take
offence
,
“
I
caneven
speak
to
worse
than
thieves
,
and
yet
,
thank
Heaven
,
escapecontamination
from
them
.
<EOS>
”Sir
<EOS>
Francis
Hartleton
<EOS>
’s
words
were
barbed
,
but
Learmont
was
quite
asresolved
as
his
opponent
not
to
understand
any
insinuations
,
and
hemerely
replied,—“You
are
a
judge
of
human
nature
,
sir
.
<EOS>
”“As
<EOS>
far
as
my
opportunities
go
,
I
am
,
”
replied
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
“I
trust
,
”
added
Learmont
,
“
that
,
notwithstanding
I
am
but
a
poorsquire
<EOS>
,
you
will
do
me
the
honour
of
visiting
me
in
my
London
abode
.
<EOS>
”“That
<EOS>
I
am
willing
to
do
,
”
said
Hartleton
,
“
forgetting
alldisagreements
,
Squire
Learmont
of
course
.
”“Disagreements
<EOS>
,
sir,—I
really
am
not
aware
of
any
.
<EOS>
You
were
at
onetime
,
if
I
remember
rightly
,
subject
to
bad
dreams
,
from
which
I
hopeyou
have
now
quite
recovered
—
I
should
think
it
a
most
grievous
andaffecting
malady
.
<EOS>
”Sir
<EOS>
Francis
felt
that
Learmont
had
rather
the
better
of
him
in
thedialogue
,
and
with
a
smile
he
bowed
and
passed
on
.
<EOS>
The
squire
looked
after
him
with
a
smile
of
bitterness
mingled
withcontempt
.
<EOS>
“You
have
entered
,
most
-
sapient
magistrate
,
”
he
said
,
“
into
a
war
withme
.
<EOS>
You
shall
abide
the
issue
,
and
pay
the
penalty
of
defeat
—
I
swear
byall
the
powers
of
heaven
and
hell
,
that
you
shall
have
my
life
,
or
Iwill
have
yours
.
<EOS>
He
who
thrusts
his
hand
into
a
fire
,
can
not
beexpected
to
withdraw
them
unburnt
.
<EOS>
Beware
,
Sir
Magistrate,—I
will
havevengeance
upon
you
when
I
am
safe
in
some
important
matters
—
but
firstas
to
Jacob
Gray
—
<EOS>
ay
,
there
is
the
great
—
difficulty
—
Jacob
Grey
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
sauntered
among
the
then
ancient
trees
that
adorned
the
park
,
andcontinued
muttering
to
himself
for
more
than
an
hour
before
he
came
toany
firm
resolve
,
and
then
he
suddenly
quickened
his
pace
,
andproceeded
homewards
.
<EOS>
When
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
reached
his
office
,
his
first
act
was
tosummon
the
man
named
Stephy
,
and
to
tell
him
to
prepare
to
accompanyhim
,
at
a
short
notice
,
some
distance
in
the
country
,
for
he
resolvedto
take
him
with
him
to
Learmont
village
,
whether
or
not
he
should
uponmature
consideration
think
it
desirable
that
Ada
should
accompany
himthere
.
<EOS>
This
matter
being
settled
,
he
received
a
report
from
a
man
whom
he
hadset
to
watch
the
house
of
Learmont
,
who
deposed
to
the
effect
<EOS>
that
aman
who
he
was
sure
was
Jacob
Gray
,
by
the
description
given
of
him
bythe
magistrate
,
had
visited
the
squire
.
<EOS>
He
then
detailed
the
whole
ofGray
’s
proceeding
during
the
night
,
concluding
by
saying
,
that
when
hiswatch
was
relieved
,
Gray
had
been
left
at
the
Old
Chequers
,
and
thathis
further
progress
would
be
reported
by
the
man
who
had
taken
hisplace
.
<EOS>
“That
will
do
,
”
said
Hartleton
;
“
he
must
not
be
lost
sight
of
for
amoment
,
unless
fairly
housed
,
and
then
the
house
must
be
carefullywatched
,
and
above
all
things
,
do
not
let
him
suspect
he
is
in
anydanger
.
<EOS>
”“The
greatest
trouble
,
sir
,
during
the
night
,
”
said
the
spy
,
“
hasarisen
from
a
shoemaker
in
Westminster
,
who
is
smitten
with
the
notionof
his
cleverness
in
apprehending
criminals
.
<EOS>
He
has
been
following
Grayabout
,
and
but
for
his
cowardice
would
have
apprehended
him
.
<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
so
spoil
all
,
”
said
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
.
<EOS>
“
It
is
of
the
greatestimportance
that
this
Gray
should
remain
at
large
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
He
isin
possession
of
information
which
,
I
fear
,
would
never
be
got
from
himafter
his
capture
,
for
no
kind
of
promise
could
possibly
be
held
out
tohim
of
mercy
in
this
world
.
<EOS>
If
once
taken
,
his
trial
and
execution
forthe
murder
of
Vaughan
must
ensue
.
<EOS>
And
then
too
,
”
added
Sir
Francis
,
ina
low
tone
to
himself
,
“
Ada
would
be
dragged
from
her
presentretirement
forward
as
a
witness
against
him
,
and
so
seal
his
lips
forever
against
any
disclosure
for
her
benefit
.
<EOS>
”A
<EOS>
knock
at
the
door
<EOS>
announced
some
one
near
,
and
when
Sir
Francis
cried“Come
in”—one
of
his
officers
appeared
,
saying—“that
a
man
of
the
nameof
Bruggles
wished
to
see
him

on

particular
business

”“Bruggles
<EOS>
,
I
do

<EOS>
”“Your

said
the
spy
upon
Gray
,
“
it

shoemaker
.
”“Oh

admit
him

<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
amateur
constable
was
ushered
into
the
presence
of
Sir
Francis
,
whosaid,—“Well

sir
,
your
business?”“My
business

private

confidential

important

”“Will

no

not
very
long

”“Then

said
Sir
Francis
to
his
officer

On

bowed
and
retired
.

“Now
,
sir
,
if
you
please

”
said
Sir
Francis
to
the
shoemaker
,
“

”The
manner
of
the
magistrate
rather
damped
the
ardour
of
the
shoemaker
,
and
he
replied—“Your
worship
<EOS>
,
I
thought
it

<EOS>
right
to
call
upon
you

mysteriously

himself

the

”The
shoemaker
,
as
he
said
this
,
leaned
forward
in
a
confident
manner

and
then
threw
his
head
back
with

CHAPTER
LXXXIII.Gray
’s
Peril.—A
Peep
into
Domestic
<EOS>
Affairs.—The
Corpulent
Lady.—The
Manwho
Was
Hung
on
Monday
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
was
so
horrified
at
the
awful
sight
that
met
his
eyes
,
uponopening
the
cupboard
in
the
old
attic
,
that
for
some
moments
he
couldneither
think
,
move
,
nor
speak
;
and
it
was
only
the
strong
presentdread
of
some
one
coming
upon
him
suddenly
from
the
lower
part
of
thehouse
and
taking
his
life
,
upon
finding
he
was
aware
of
the
murderedman
being
in
the
cupboard
<EOS>
,
that
aroused
him
from
the
absolute
lethargyof
<EOS>
fear
he
was
rapidly
falling
into
.
<EOS>
The
body
lay
on
its
face
at
his
feet
,
and
it
appeared
to
have
beenpropped
up
in
the
cupboard
,
merely
by
the
shutting
of
the
door
quickly
,
so
that
it
had
fallen
out
the
moment
Gray
had
,
by
opening
the
door
,
removed
the
support
.
<EOS>
He
felt
that
there
was
no
chance
for
him
but
putting
the
loathsomeobject
back
again
into
its
receptacle
,
and
our
readers
may
imagine
whata
terrible
job
it
was
to
such
a
man
as
Jacob
Gray
to
raise
that
hideousmass
of
death
,
and
replace
it
in
the
cupboard
.
<EOS>
He
stooped
and
laid
histrembling
hands
upon
the
neck
.
<EOS>
He
dragged
it
up
—
the
head
hung
about
inthat
strange
loose
manner
which
indicates
a
certain
stage
in
theprogress
of
decomposition
.
<EOS>
Gray
shuddered
,
and
bungled
much
over
what
he
had
to
do
,
because
hisobject
was
to
get
the
dead
body
into
the
cupboard
without
looking
atthe
face
;
and
he
,
therefore
,
sedulously
turned
his
head
away
.
<EOS>
The
weight
was
very
great
,
and
after
many
fruitless
efforts
,
Gray
foundit
impossible
to
get
the
body
fixed
for
one
instant
,
so
as
to
allow
himto
close
the
door
.
<EOS>
Once
he
caught
one
of
the
ghastly
bands
between
thedoor
and
the
side
-
post
.
<EOS>
Then
,
by
not
being
quick
enough
,
the
bodyleaned
forward
,
and
he
caught
the
hideous
distorted
face
in
the
sameway
.
<EOS>
A
cry
of
horror
burst
from
his
lips
,
as
his
eyes
inadvertently
fellupon
the
horrible
visage
,
and
now
that
he
had
once
looked
he
could
notturn
his
eyes
away
,
had
he
been
offered
a
world
for
the
effort
.
<EOS>
“Horrible
!
<EOS>
Horrible
!
”
<EOS>
he
moaned
,
and
then
letting
go
the
door
,
the
bodyfell
as
at
first
,
with
a
heavy
lump
upon
its
face
,
at
his
feet
.
<EOS>
“I
shall
be
murdered
here
,
”
thought
Gray
,
“
and
must
leave
at
allhazards
.
<EOS>
I
—
I
had
better
risk
being
again
seen
,
and
hooted
by
the
mob
,
than
remain
here
to
certain
death
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
approached
the
window
as
he
spoke
;
but
to
his
horror
,
he
found
bythe
shout
that
at
once
greeted
him
,
that
his
tormentors
were
stillthere
.
<EOS>
“What
can
save
me
now
?
”
<EOS>
he
groaned
,
“
I
am
lost
—
lost
.
”He
<EOS>
sunk
upon
the
miserable
chair
that
was
in
the
room
,
and
groanedaloud
in
the
bitterness
of
his
despair
.
<EOS>
Then
he
began
to
wonder
that
no
one
came
to
the
attic
,
and
from
that
hethought
it
just
possible
there
might
be
nobody
in
the
house
,
and
thathis
own
fears
had
converted
some
casual
noise
into
the
sounds
offootsteps
on
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
There
was
hope
in
this
conjecture
,
and
he
crept
cautiously
to
the
door
,
and
standing
at
the
stair
-
head
,
he
listened
attentively
,
but
could
hearno
noise
.
<EOS>
“I
wonder
,
”
<EOS>
he
muttered
to
himself
,
“
if
I
could
venture
down
stairs
.
<EOS>
There
might
be
no
one
between
me
and
the
street
-
door
,
and
possibly
Imight
not
be
recognised
by
the
gaping
crowd
outside
,
and
so
escape
mypresent
most
dangerous
situation
.
<EOS>
”It
<EOS>
was
some
minutes
more
before
he
could
make
up
his
mind
to
venturedown
the
stairs
;
and
when
,
at
length
,
he
did
,
he
went
step
by
step
withsuch
extreme
slowness
and
caution
,
that
it
was
a
long
time
before
hereached
the
bottom
of
the
first
flight
.
<EOS>
The
least
creaking
sent
theblood
to
his
heart
with
a
frightful
gush
,
and
by
the
time
he
hadreached
the
floor
below
the
attic
,
he
was
in
a
state
of
terror
andnervousness
that
would
have
alarmed
any
one
to
behold
.
<EOS>
He
sat
down
upon
the
bottom
stair
,
and
as
far
as
he
was
able
to
commandthem
,
he
bent
all
his
faculties
to
discover
if
there
was
any
one
in
therooms
opening
from
the
landing
.
<EOS>
One
door
was
ajar
,
and
he
now
felt
satisfied
there
was
no
one
there
,
but
another
door
was
close
shut
,
and
it
was
with
the
greatestdifficulty
that
he
could
command
his
nerves
to
crawl
past
it
.
<EOS>
His
footnow
was
upon
the
first
stair
from
the
top
of
the
next
flight
of
stairs
,
when
he
nearly
fell
headlong
from
top
to
bottom
,
as
he
heard
a
man’svoice
below
say,—“Thomas
—
I
shall
want
you
in
your
attic
,
presently
.
<EOS>
”Then
<EOS>
a
step
sounded
up
the
stairs
,
and
Jacob
Gray
had
just
time
tocrawl
backwards
into
the
room
with
the
door
ajar
,
before
he
must
havebeen
seen
.
<EOS>
But
he
thought
whoever
is
coming
here
,
may
enter
this
room
,
and
heglanced
hastily
around
him
for
some
place
to
hide
in
.
<EOS>
A
large
handsome
bed
was
in
the
room
with
the
curtains
drawn
,
and
JacobGray
advancing
cautiously
,
peered
in
between
them
,
when
to
his
horrorand
consternation
<EOS>
,
he
found
the
bed
occupied
.
<EOS>
An
elderly
female
,
with
a
red
termagant
face
,
who
by
the
mountain
shemade
of
the
bed
clothes
,
must
have
been
of
most
ample
proportions
,
laysleeping
in
the
bed
.
<EOS>
The
slight
noise
he
made
,
appeared
to
have
disturbed
the
lady
,
for
along
-
drawn
snore
proclaimed
that
her
easy
slumbers
were
about
beingdisturbed
.
<EOS>
Gray
heard
two
or
three
hard
blows
given
to
the
bed
,
and
then
the
ladymuttered,—“Take
<EOS>
that
,
you
wretch
—
you’ll
<EOS>
disturb
me
,
<EOS>
will
you
,
again
,
”
and
thenevidently
fancying
she
had
silenced
her
supposed
bed
-
fellow
,
thecorpulent
lady
,
with
a
singular
imitation
of
a
bassoon
by
means
of
herolfactory
organ
,
she
again
resigned
herself
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
The
same
man
’s
name
that
Gray
had
heard
already
,
now
said
at
the
door,—“You’re
asleep
yet
,
are
you
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
you
are
a
beauty
—
well
,
there
is
somepeace
in
the
house
early
in
the
morning
,
for
all
who
like
to
get
up
,
and
enjoy
—
because
you
are
too
lazy
to
be
among
us
<EOS>
so
early
,
if
ever
aman
was
cursed
—
ah
,
<EOS>
well
,
it
’s
no
use
complaining
.
<EOS>
”“Oh
<EOS>
,
you
disagreeable
beast
!
”
<EOS>
shrieked
the
lady
,
who
had
only
been
inwhat
<EOS>
is
termed
a
dog
-
sleep
,
and
had
heard
the
remarks
of
the
man
at
thedoor
.
<EOS>
“You
wretch
—
you
varmint
.
<EOS>
So
that
’s
the
way
you
goes
on
,
is
it
?
<EOS>
You
uglylump
of
wretchedness?”“What
do
you
say
,
my
dear
?
”
remarked
the
man
in
so
altered
and
humble
avoice
that
Jacob
Gray
could
scarcely
believe
it
came
from
the
sameindividual
.
<EOS>
“What
<EOS>
did
I
say
,
you
unnatural
villain
—
<EOS>
I
say
I
heard
you
talking
aboutpeace
in
the
house
.
”“Really
<EOS>
my
love
,
I—”“Don’t
try
to
escape
out
of
it
,
you
wretched
little
villain
—
wait
till
Iget
up
,
that
’s
all
.
<EOS>
”With
<EOS>
a
sigh
<EOS>
the
unhappy
husband
,
for
nobody
but
a
husband
ever
puts
upwith
a
woman
’s
tongue
,
and
by
some
strange
fatality
,
he
who
is
the
onlyperson
having
a
legal
right
to
control
it
’s
wagging
,
never
,
or
veryrarely
,
does
so
—
turned
away
.
<EOS>
“Who
<EOS>
’s
<EOS>
down
stairs
?
<EOS>
”
cried
the
lady
,
peremptorily
.
<EOS>
“Only
Thomas
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
”“Isn’t
<EOS>
that
lazy
slut
,
Deborah
,
up
<EOS>
yet?”“Oh
dear
<EOS>
yes
,
my
love
.
”“Oh
<EOS>
dear
<EOS>
yes
,
indeed
,
”
answered
the
lady
;
<EOS>
“
I
’ll
box
your
ears
and
herstoo
when
I
get
up
.
<EOS>
You
’ve
been
winking
at
her
again
—
<EOS>
I’ll
be
bound

.
”“Really
<EOS>
,
my
love—”“Go
away
,
sir
,
and
do
n’t
aggravate
me
.
<EOS>
It
would
make
folk
’s
hair
standon
end
to
know
what
I
suffer
—
it
would
.
<EOS>
”The
lady
now
turned
round
on
the
bed
with
such
a
bounce
that
Jacob
Graythought
for
a
moment
it
must
eventually
come
down
on
the
top
of
him
.
<EOS>
“What
shall
I
do
now
?
”
<EOS>
thought
Gray
;
“
this
is
a
strange
house
.
<EOS>
They
donot
seem
at
all
the
kind
of
persons
I
suspected
.
<EOS>
How
could
that
deadbody
have
come
into
the
cupboard
in
the
attic
?
<EOS>
Perhaps
they
do
n’t
knowit
’s
there
at
all
,
and
if
I
should
be
seen
,
it
will
in
some
way
be
laidto
my
charge
.
”He
<EOS>
now
remained
for
some
moments
in
painful
thought
.
<EOS>
Then
he
came
atlength
to
a
conclusion
that
he
must
venture
down
stairs
before
the
ladygot
up
,
as
his
only
chance
of
getting
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
“Only
<EOS>
Thomas
down
stairs
,
”
he
repeated
to
himself
,
“
and
a
servant
girlI
presume
?
<EOS>
I
must
make
the
attempt
as
circumstances
direct
me
—
at
theback
or
the
front
of
the
house
,
I
may
be
able
to
leave
it
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
made
now
a
very
slight
movement
in
an
endeavour
to
crawl
from
underthe
bed
,
and
make
towards
the
door
,
but
the
corpulent
virago
heard
him
,
and
cried,—“I
thought
I
heard
somebody
a
moving
.
<EOS>
I
shall
get
up
and
ring
forDeborah
.
<EOS>
Lor

<EOS>
”“If
<EOS>
I
let
her
get
up
and
have
assistance
here
,
I
am
lost
,
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
It
took
him
a
moment
or
two
more
to
screw
up
his
courage
,
and
then
hesuddenly
rose
up
at
the
side
of
the
bed
,
and
said,—“If
you
stir
or
speak
for
the
next
half
hour
<EOS>
,
I
’ll
cut
your
throat

”The
<EOS>
corpulent

gave
a
loud
scream
,
and
Jacob
Gray
sneaked
under
thebed
again
.
<EOS>
“Beware

”
he
said
,
“
beware!”“Oh

Mr.
Murderer

”
she
gasped
.
<EOS>
“What
’s
the
matter
?
<EOS>
”
said
the
husband
,
who
had
come
scuffling
downstairs
,
upon
hearing
the
scream
.
<EOS>
“Beware
!
”
<EOS>
whispered
Gray
.
<EOS>
“N

gasped
the
corpulent

with
the
fear
of

LXXXIV.The
<EOS>
Mystery
Explained.—The
Escape.—Jacob
Gray
’s
New
Lodging
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
was
almost
distilled
with
fear
as
this
little
dialogueproceeded
,
and
it
seemed
as
if
a
mountain
was
taken
off
his
breast
whenhe
heard
the
husband
go
away
,
muttering
something
that
was
not
intendedto
<EOS>
meet
his
lady
<EOS>
’s
ear
.
<EOS>
The
corpulent
lady
then
commenced
a
series
of
groans
,
which
,
however
,
Jacob
Gray
soon
put
an
end
to
,
by
appearing
at
the
bedside
,
and
saying,—“If
you
do
n’t
be
quiet
this
moment
,
it
shall
be
your
last
.
<EOS>
”“W
<EOS>
—
w
—
what
do
you
want
?
”
stammered
the
corpulent
female
.
<EOS>
“No
matter
,
”
said
Gray
;
“
tell
me
what
dead
body
that
is
you
have
in
theattic?”“Job
Magnus
,
”
said
the
lady
,
shaking
the
bed
with
trembling
.
<EOS>
“Who?”“Job
<EOS>
Magnus
—
he
—
he
was
bought
.
”“Bought
<EOS>
,
woman!”“Yes
—
he
—
he
was
hanged
last
Monday
,
and
my
—
my
wretch
of
a
husband
boughthim
.
<EOS>
”“What
is
your
husband?”“A
doctor
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
truth
in
a
moment
now
flashed
across
Gray
’s
mind
,
and
he
cursedhimself
bitterly
for
allowing
his
fears
to
cause
him
so
much
uneasinessand
terror
as
they
had
done
.
<EOS>
He
,
then
,
on
the
instant
,
thought
of
ascheme
to
escape
from
the
surgeon
’s
house
without
molestation
,
andturning
to
the
lady
,
he
said
in
a
solemn
<EOS>
voice,—“Do
you
know
me?”“No
—
<EOS>
no
.
”“I
have
just
come
down
stairs
out
of
the
cupboard
.
<EOS>
I
am
Job
Magnus
.
”“Mercy
<EOS>
upon
us
!
”
cried
the
lady—“Oh
!
<EOS>
Have
mercy
upon
us
—
our
Fatherwhich
art
in
heaven
.
<EOS>
”“Hush
!
”
cried
Gray
,
“
do
n’t
be
mumbling
there
,
but
listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
If
youso
much
as
speak
one
word
,
or
stir
from
whence
you
are
for
the

and
a
half
,
I
’ll
come
down
the
chimney
and
strangle
you

”“Please
<EOS>
,
Mr.
Ghost
,
spare
my
sinful
life
,
and
I
wo
n’t
move
.
<EOS>
I’llconfess
all

Thomas
ai
n’t
that
wretched
husband
’s
of
mine
—
he’s
—
he’s
—
<EOS>
I’mquite
sure—”“Bush
,
”
said
Gray
,
with
a
menacing
gesture
,
“
do
you
imagine
I
want
tohear
<EOS>
what
,
as
a
spirit
,
I
know
already?”The
corpulent
lady
groaned
as
she
<EOS>
said,—“Then
<EOS>
you
know
all
about
the
barber?”Gray
deliberately
turned
up
the
cuffs
of
his
coat
,
and
said
calmly,—“I
am
going
to
strangle
you
,
if
you
open
your
lips
again
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
corpulent
lady
held
up
her
hands
in
mute
supplication
,
and
after
aglance
at
her
,
and
a
contortion
of
his
visage
that
nearly
froze
herblood
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
crept
from
the
room
,
and
commenced
descending
thestaircase
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
got
half
way
down
,
when
he
heard
some
one
coming
up
.
<EOS>
Hepaused
in
very
great
trepidation
and
laid
hold
of
the
banisters
toawait
the
comer
.
<EOS>
His
only
chance
now
lay
on
his
own
firmness
,
and
thatwas
nearly
deserting
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
young
lad
of
about
seventeen
or
eighteen
,
who
was
coming
upstairs
,
and
when
he
saw
Gray
,
he
waited
a
step
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
“Thomas
<EOS>
,
”
said
Gray
,
“
I
am
Job
Magnus
—
<EOS>
will
you—”Thomas
did
not
stay
to
hear
the
remainder
of
what
the
apparition
of
thehanged
man
,
as
he
fully
believed
Gray
to
be
,
had
to
say
,
but
turnedround
,
and
made
but
one
jump
down
the
stairs
again
,
never
stopped
tillhe
was
in
the
kitchen
,
where
he
upset
Deborah
and
a
tray
with
thebreakfast
things
,
just
as
she
was
emerging
from
the
culinary
department
.
<EOS>
“So
far
successful
,
”
muttered
Gray
,
as
he
descended
the
remainder
ofthe
stairs
,
and
then
passed
through
the
door
which
opened
into
a
littleparlour
.
<EOS>
Hanging
on
a
peg
behind
a
door
was
a
handsome
cloak
,
and
on
another
ahat
,
both
of
which
Gray
made
no
hesitation
in
borrowing
for
theoccasion
.
<EOS>
Hastily
attiring
himself
thus
,
he
opened
a
small
glass
door
,
and
passed
into
the
shop
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
little
girl
in
the
shop
,
knocking
perseveringly
on
thecounter
with
the
edge
of
a
penny
piece
,
and
the
moment
Gray
made
hisappearance
<EOS>
she
commenced,—“Oh
,
please
sir
,
my
mother
says
do—”“Silence
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Gray
—
and
he
passed
out
into
the
street
,
leaving
thelittle
girl
with
a
full
impression
that
the
doctor
had
gone
mad
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
’s
first
glance
was
towards
his
persecutors
,
and
he
saw
thatthe
patience
of
all
of
them
had
been
nearly
tired
out
,
with
theexception
of
the
baker
’s
boy
,
who
sat
upon
the
edge
of
his
basket
andtold
the
story
of
a
man
being
on
the
roofs
of
the
houses
to
all
comers
.
<EOS>
“You
wretch
,
”
muttered
Gray
,
“
I
should
like
to
brain
you
.
”“Hilloa
<EOS>
—
here
comes
the
doctor
,
”
cried
the
boy
,
“
why
,
you
’ve
got
upwrong
end
first
,
old
cove
.
<EOS>
”“Take
<EOS>
that
,
”
said
Gray
,
as
he
dealt
the
boy
a
box
on
the
face
that
senthim
sprawling
backwards
into
his
own
basket
,
to
the
immense
amusementof
all
the
other
boys
there
collected
,
who
,
not
to
be
behindhand
inasserting
their
right
to
the
name
of
human
beings
,
immediately
made
atthe
fallen
hero
,
and
commenced
hauling
and
pummelling
him
to
theirheart
’s
content
.
<EOS>
With
a
hasty
step
Gray
left
the
scene
of
action
,
and
struck
at
onceinto
a
long
narrow
lane
which
led
him
among
the
by
-
streets
at
the
backof
the
Strand
.
<EOS>
His
first
object
now
was
to
get
a
breakfast
,
and
observing
a
littledirty
shop
where
every
imaginable
abomination
in
the
eating
line
wassold
,
he
plunged
into
its
dark
recesses
,
and
asked
of
a
woman
,
whosevery
appearance
was
enough
to
turn
any
one
’s
stomach
,
if
he
could
havesome
breakfast
.
<EOS>
“That
depends
on
what
you
want
,
”
said
the
woman
.
<EOS>
“Some
meat
,
”
said
Gray
;
“
I
will
pay
you
liberally
if
you
will
purchasefor
me
some
meat
,
and
let
me
eat
it
here
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
words
“
pay
liberally
”
<EOS>
acted
like
magic
on
the
woman
,
for
sheimmediately
unrolled
her
sleeves
which
were
tucked
up
to
the
elbow
,
andat
once
,
by
that
process
covering
up
all
the
dirt
on
her
arms
<EOS>
she
said,—“Oh
dear
<EOS>
yes
,
certainly
—
his
honour
could
have
whatever
he
liked
;
shouldshe
take
his
honour
’s
hat
and
cloak
?
<EOS>
Would
his
honour
walk
up
stairs?”“Yes
—
up
stairs
,
”
said
Gray
,
conceiving
himself
much
more
safe
fromcasual
observation
there
than
below
.
<EOS>
The
woman
escorted
him
to
a
dismal
-
looking
room
on
the
first
floor
,
andpromising
to
be
quick
in
procuring
what
he
required
,
she
left
him
tohis
meditations
.
<EOS>
“This
seems
a
likely
place
in
which
to
conceal
myself
,
”
thought
Gray,“until
I
have
rung
from
the
fears
of
Learmont
a
sufficient
sum
toenable
me
to
put
my
now
firm
design
into
execution
of
leaving
England
,
I
will
ask
this
woman
if
she
has
a
room
she
can
spare
me
for
apermanency
—
no
one
would
think
of
looking
for
me
here
;
and
in
thedarkness
of
the
evenings
I
can
glide
out
to
visit
Learmont
,
and
forexercise
.
<EOS>
”When
<EOS>
the
woman
returned
and
laid
before
Jacob
Gray
some
really
good
andtempting
meat
,
tolerably
cooked
,
and
had
received
his
orders
to
get
hima
bottle
of
wine
,
he
turned
his
small
,
cunning
eyes
upon
her
,
and
said,—“I
have
but
newly
come
from
abroad
,
and
am
in
London
concerning
someproperty
that
is
left
me
:
<EOS>
while
I
remain
,
can
you
accommodate
me
here?”“Oh
,
certainly
,
”
said
the
woman
;
“
your
honour
can
have
any
room
in
thehouse
.
<EOS>
”“I
should
prefer
the
quietest
,
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
An
attic
will
suit
me
aswell
as
any
.
<EOS>
”“Well
<EOS>
,
your
honour
,
”
said
the
woman
,
“
if
you
do
n’t
mind
an
attic
,
we
docertainly
have
the
best
attic
,
though
I
say
it
,
in
London
.
<EOS>
Why
,
’
atweentwo

’
when
there
ai
n’t
a
fog
,
and
the
brewhouse
is
n’t
atwork
<EOS>
,
you
may
see
a
little
bit
of
the
river
from
our
attic
.
”“It
<EOS>
will
suit
me
very
well
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
”
said
Gray
;
“
when
I
havefinished
my
meal
,
I
will
look
at
it
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
was
not
long
in
consuming
the
meat
and
bread
,
and
after
a
glass
ortwo
of
the
wine
he
felt
wonderfully
refreshed
,
and
his
old
quiet
smileof
cunning
and
ferocity
began
to
linger
on
his
face
as
he
muttered,—“Well
,
if
the
squire
consents
to
my
terms
,
and
advances
me
a
large
sumof
money
at
once
<EOS>
,
I
will
leave
directly
;
and
if
he
will
not
,
I
mustincrease
my
demands
upon
him
as
far
as
I
can
,
without
awakening
hissuspicions
,
and
then
leave
him
and
Britton
to
destruction
;
it
will
gohard
<EOS>
but
I
will
find
a
means
of
revenge
against
her
,
who
has
caused
mesuch
unexampled
misery
and
distress
.
<EOS>
Ada

<EOS>
Yet

Jacob
Gray

<EOS>
He
is
a

secret
,
untilsome

you
find

<EOS>

Ada
,
allthat

<EOS>
had

.
<EOS>
”Full
of
these
thoughts
<EOS>
,
Jacob
Gray
summoned
the
woman
,
and
desired
tobe
shown
the
chamber
she
had
mentioned
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
remarkable
low
-
roofedattic
,
but
it
suited
Gray
well
,
for
no
one
,
he
thought
,
would
suspecthim
of
living
in
,
to
him
,
so
dangerous
a
neighbourhood
as
the
Strand
,
where
every
inhabitant
was
full
of
gossip
about
the
murder
of
Vaughan
.
<EOS>
“This
will
do
,
”
he
said
.
<EOS>
“
What
is
the
price?”Two
shillings
a
week
were
named
,
to
which
Gray
assented
,
and
payingsome
few
weeks
in
advance
,
he
said,—“When
<EOS>
ever
I
go
out
<EOS>
I
take
the
key
of
this
room
with
me
,
and
whateverrequires
to
be
done
to
it
,
must
be
done
when
I
am
at
home
<EOS>
,
I
make
myown
bed
.
<EOS>
”“Very
<EOS>
well
,
just
as
you
like
.
<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
mark
my
words
,
if
any
one
should
come
here
and
ask
you
if
you
havea
lodger
of
any
description
,
unless
you
unhesitatingly
answer
no
,
Ileave
directly
.
<EOS>
”“Lor
,
<EOS>
sir,—suppose
some
friend
of

’s
was
to
call
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
—
have
no

.
”“Indeed
<EOS>
,
your
honour
.
<EOS>
”“No
<EOS>
—
nor
ever
had
any
—
nor
ever

—
I
am
peculiarly
situated
.
<EOS>
There
arepeople
in
this
city
who
would
murder
me
to
keep
me
out
of
my
justproperty
.
<EOS>
”“Is
<EOS>
there
indeed
,
sir
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
the
wretches
.
<EOS>
”“Yes
,
<EOS>
and
the
reason
I
come
to
live
here
is
by
the
advice
of
mylawyers
,
in
order
that
I
should
not
be
found
by
those
who
would
take
mylife
if
they
could
.
<EOS>
”“Lord
,
what
wickedness
there
is
in
the
world
,
”
said
the
woman
.
<EOS>
“There
is
indeed
,
”
said
Gray
,
gravely
.
<EOS>
“
When
I
come
to
my
property
,
depend
upon
a
very
handsome
present
from
me
if
you
obey
my
injunctions
.
<EOS>
”The
woman
curtseyed
to
the
very
ground
,
and
Gray
then
signified
to
herthat
she
might
retire
and
leave
him
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
little
imagined
how
actively
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
waswatching
him
,
and
at
that
very
moment
that
he
was
conversing
with
thewoman
about
the
necessity
of
denying
him
to
every
one
,
a
man
was
in
thedoorway
opposite
taking
the
most
accurate
notice
of
the
house
,
andrevolving
in
his
mind
some
means
of
discovering
whether
Jacob
Grayintended
remaining
there
or
not
.
<EOS>
The
fact
was
,
he
had
never
been
lost
sight
of
by
one
or
other
of
SirFrancis
Hartleton
’s
men
,
and
although
they
had
been
momentarily
atfault
when
he
got
in
at
the
doctor
’s
attic
window
,
one
of
them
hadremained
on
the
spot
while
another
went
into
a
neighbouring
house
,
theowner
of
which
he
knew
,
and
clambering
out
on
the
roof
felt
satisfiedthat
Gray
was
housed
somewhere
.
<EOS>
He
was
instantly
recognised
,
notwithstanding
the
hat
and
cloak
,
by
thelynx

eyed
officers
,
and
quietly
dogged
to

Treachery
to
Albert
Seyton.—The
Plot
Against
Gray
.
<EOS>
The
guilty
career
of
Learmont
is
nearly
run
,
and
the
fates
are
hurryinghim
to
that
awful
precipice
down
which
the
souls
of
the
wicked
plungenever
to
return
;
and
yet
,
how
strange
it
is
that
in
the
designs
andmachinations
of
men
of
blood
and
deep
iniquity
,
their
danger
is
everthe
greatest
when
they
are
hugging
themselves
in
fancied
security
.
<EOS>
So
was
it
in
the
strange
circumstances
of
our
story
—
circumstanceswhich
,
with
a
labour
we
should
again
shrink
from
,
we
have
collectedfrom
ancient
resources
,
and
time
-
worn
family
documents
.
<EOS>
Learmont
thought
himself
now
in
a
far
better
position
than
he
had
everbeen
in
,
for
although
the
child
,
whose
existence
in
the
hands
of
JacobGray
had
always
been
the
bane
of
his
existence
,
was
now
<EOS>
,
he
felt
sure
,
in
the
house
of
the
man
whose
energy
and
acuteness
he
had
most
to
fear;he
reasoned
himself
into
a
belief
that
had
there
been
contingent
uponsuch
circumstances
imminent
danger
to
be
apprehended
from
Sir
FrancisHartleton
,
he
would
ere
this
have
heard
of
it
,
for
the
magistrate
wasprompt
in
action
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
have
but
<EOS>
now
,
”
he
thought
,
“
to
destroy
Jacob
Gray
and
hisconfession
,
whereas
,
before
,
by
keeping
his
confession
at
one
place
,
and
the
child
at
another
,
I
dare
not
attack
him
with
any
degree
ofsafety
.
”Jacob
<EOS>
Gray
,
too
,
as
we
have
seen
,
fancied
himself
over
his
worsttroubles
,
and
hugged
himself
with
the
idea
that
he
held
as
strong
ahold
as
ever
upon
the
fears
of
Learmont
,
and
had
but
to
exercise
commoncaution
to
replace
himself
in
as
enviable
a
situation
,
as
regardspecuniary
resources
,
as
he
had
been
before
.
<EOS>
Andrew
Britton
had
plenty
to
drink
,
as
he
,
too
,
felt
in
his
waytolerably
happy
,
only
he
would
have
given
a
great
deal
,
or
evenconsented
to
go
without
brandy
for
a
whole
day
,
for
the
sake
of
anopportunity
of
knocking
Jacob
Gray
on
the
head
.
<EOS>
Learmont
’s
only
doubt
now
was
whether
to
set
the
smith
or
Albert
Seytonupon
the
footsteps
of
Jacob
Gray
,
when
he
should
make
his
next
visit;for
<EOS>
the
same
objection
,
namely
,
of
personal
recognition
applied
toboth
,
only
Jacob
Gray
would
not
be
so
apt
to
suppose
Albert
Seyton
tobe
set
on
by
Learmont
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
argument
,
he
decided
upon
informing
Albert
,
when
he
shouldnext
see
him
,
that
the
identity
of
the
man
he
(
Learmont
)
wished
him
towatch
was
Jacob
Gray
,
who
held
so
long
in
durance
the
beautiful
girlwhose
image
held
so
constant
a
place
in
his
heart
.
<EOS>
By
still
assuring
Albert
of
the
probability
of
Ada
being
with
Gray
,
Learmont
considered
that
he
should
interest
him
to
strain
every
nerveto
discover
his
residence
,
and
,
we
shudder
as
we
write
it
,
but
thecold
-
blooded
squire
determined
upon
the
death
of
Albert
the
moment
<EOS>
heshould
cease
to
be
of
any
service
,
or
become
in
the
least
troublesomeor
suspicious
.
<EOS>
Engaged
in
such
unholy
cogitations
as
those
,
the
day
to
Learmont
passedmore
swiftly
,
and
more
pleasantly
than
had
done
many
a
preceding
one
,
and
when
he
rose
the
following
morning
,
he
looked
more
himself
than
hehad
done
since
his
first
attempt
upon
the
life
of
Gray
,
at
the
ruinoushouse
in
South
Lambeth
—
an
attempt
which
had
so
signally
failed
,
andwhich
,
in
its
result
,
had
suppressed
the
squire
with
a
sense
of
thehopelessness
of
ever
getting
rid
of
the
running
Jacob
.
<EOS>
Albert
Seyton
,
his
mind
agitated
by
a
thousand
hopes
and
fears
,
waspunctual
in
his
attendance
upon
Learmont
;
<EOS>
and
,
when
he
entered
the
roomin
which
sat
the
squire
,
any
one
might
have
seen
by
his
countenancethat
he
had
passed
a
sleepless
night
,
and
that
he
was
suffering
all
thetender
anxieties
of
newly
awakened
hope
upon
a
subject
nearest
hisheart
.
<EOS>
Learmont
motioned
him
to
be
seated
,
and
then
stealing
but
a
glance
<EOS>
atthe
face
of
the
young
man
<EOS>
,
he
said,—“Young
<EOS>
sir
,
I
have
been
thinking
over
the
story
you
told
me
yesterday
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
thank
you
,
sir
,
”
said
Albert
;
“
may
I
venture
to
hope
that
matureconsideration
has
not
in
any
way
altered
the
sanguine
opinion
you
werepleased
to
pronounce
yesterday
upon
the
subject
.
”“It
<EOS>
has
not
.
”“Thank
<EOS>
Heaven!”“But—”Albert
’s
colour
came
and
went
rapidly
at
this
“
but
”
of
Learmont
<EOS>
’s
<EOS>
,
andthe
squire
continued
<EOS>
calmly,—“You
observed
my
agitation
yesterday
.
<EOS>
”“I
—
<EOS>
I
did
,
sir
.
<EOS>
”“Can
<EOS>
you
guess
its
cause
—
that
is
,
can
you
guess
what
brought
on
thespasm
<EOS>
I
am
subject
to?”“I
<EOS>
can
not
,
sir
.
<EOS>
”“Then
I
will
tell
you
.
<EOS>
When
you
mentioned
the
name
of
Jacob
Gray
,
astrange
feeling
came
over
me
that
I
had
heard
it
before
,
but
I
was
notcertain
.
<EOS>
”“Yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
”“Yes
.
<EOS>
Since
last
you
and
I
met
,
I
have
taken
some
pains
to
ascertainthe
fact
,
and
I
find
that
a
man
of
that
name
has
applied
to
me
,
hearingof
my
many
charities
for
pecuniary
assistance
,
saying
that
he
had
anorphan
child
to
support
,
and
was
in
great
poverty
.
”“Indeed
,
sir
.
<EOS>
”“Such
is
the
fact
.
<EOS>
His
name
is
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
”“And
—
and
sir
—
you
have
really
seen
him
?
”
<EOS>
stammered
Albert
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
have
—
he
came
here
,
and
upon
the
spurious
story
he
told
I
relievedhis
necessities
;
but
the
next
time
he
came
,
I
refused
him
,
when
Iunderstand
he
cursed
me
as
he
went
through
my
hall
,
and
uttered
threatsagainst
me
.
<EOS>
”“The
<EOS>
villain!”“Yes
<EOS>
,
young
sir
,
that
is
the
reward
generally
of
benevolence
.
<EOS>
”“Oh
<EOS>
,
this
is
most
providential
,
”
said
Albert
,
tears
of
joy
burstingfrom
his
eyes—“it
is
surely
Heaven
’s
own
work
.
<EOS>
”“’Tis
<EOS>
rather
singular
,
”
remarked
Learmont
,
coldly
.
<EOS>
“You
have
then
his
address
,
sir
—
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Give
it
me
,
and
let
me
fly
torescue—”“Stop
—
I
have
not
his
address
.
<EOS>
”Albert
<EOS>
’s
countenance
fell
.
<EOS>
“He
left
no
address
here
.
<EOS>
He
would
allow
no
inquiry
into
hiscircumstances
,
which
was
the
reason
I
refused
to
continue
my
bountytowards
him
.
<EOS>
”“Then
—
then
—
nothing
is
gained
<EOS>
,
”
sighed
Albert—“I
am
wretched
as
before
.
<EOS>
”“Not
<EOS>
so
,
”
said
Learmont
;
<EOS>
“
you
are
like
all
those
who
are
easilyelated
—
too
easily
depressed
.
”“Pardon
<EOS>
me
,
sir
,
but
this
is
a
matter
upon
which
my
whole
happiness
—
mywhole
existence
,
is
,
as
it
were
,
staked
.
<EOS>
I
do
feel
,
perhaps
,
toostrongly
,
but
such
love
as
mine
is
scarce
,
and
I
cannot
—
<EOS>
cannot
help
it
<EOS>
,
sir
—
pray
forgive
<EOS>
me!”“Think
not
I
am
angry
,
”
said
Learmont
,
“
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
I
have
notbeen
so
well
pleased
for
many
a
day
:
when
I
said
you
were
too
easilyelated
or
depressed
,
I
had
a
suggestion
to
offer
you
.
<EOS>
”“How
<EOS>
shall
I
thank
you
,
sir?”“Heed
not
that
.
<EOS>
My
strong
opinion
is
,
that
this
man
Gray
will
come
hereagain
for
,
after
his
repulse
,
he
has
written
me
a
letter
in
which
hebegs
for
a
small
sum
towards
a
larger
one
he
is
gathering
to
take
himfrom
England
;
and
<EOS>
he
says
,
that
if
I
felt
inclined
,
he
could
tell
me
asecret
,
which
he
is
quite
sure
would
enable
me
to
right
the
wronged
,
and
punish
those
who
had
been
guilty
.
<EOS>
”“He
alludes
to
Ada
,
sir
<EOS>
,
”
cried
Albert
,
with
animation
.
<EOS>
“
He
alludes
toher
of
whom
I
told
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
she
is
beautiful
and
good
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
anobler
,
better
heart
than
hers
never
beat
in
woman
’s
bosom
.
<EOS>
It
is
notfor
her
rare
and
unexampled
beauty
that
I
love
her
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
no
;
’
tisfor
her
many
gracious
heavenly
qualities
—
for
the
fine
mind
that
,
like
aglistening
diamond
,
does
outshine
the
setting
,
though
of
purest
gold
.
<EOS>
”“No
<EOS>
doubt
he
alludes
to
her
,
”
said
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“
As
I
say
,
he
sent
me
thisletter
,
it
was
without
date
,
without
address
,
and
stated
that
itswriter
,
Jacob
Gray
,
would
call
here
for
an
answer
.
<EOS>
”Albert
<EOS>
’s
breath
seemed
to
hang
upon
the
next
words
of
the
squire
as
heasked
,
“
And
has
he
been
,
sir?”“He
has
not
,
”
said
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“Ada
!
Ada
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Albert
,
and
then
,
ashamed
of
the
violence
of
hisfeelings
,
he
blushed
scarlet
,
and
endeavoured
to
apologise
.
<EOS>
“Heed
it
<EOS>
not
—
heed
it
not
!
”
<EOS>
said
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“
There
can
be
no
doubt
<EOS>
butthis
man
will
call
for
an
answer
to
his
letter
,
and
your
line
ofproceeding
will
then
be
to
follow
him
to
his
home
,
taking
care
,
as
yousay
<EOS>
he
knows
you
,
to
keep
out
of
his
sight
.
”“Oh
,
yes
,
sir
,
I
will
follow
him
were
he
to
lead
me
half
over
theworld
.
<EOS>
Let
me
but
once
set
eyes
again
on
Jacob
Gray
and
I
will
neverlose
sight
of
him
except
I
leave
him
at
his
own
home
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
hope
,
”
said
Learmont
,
who
felt
a
delight
in
hurrying
Albert’sspirits
down
from
boiling
point
to
Zero
,
“
that
my
Jacob
Gray
and
yoursare
the
same
men
.
<EOS>
”“Surely
<EOS>
they
—
they
must
be
,
”
faltered
Albert
Seyton
.
<EOS>
“Nay
,
my
young
friend
,
we
should
arm
ourselves
against
thedisappointment
if
they
should
turn
out
to
be
different
persons
.
<EOS>
”“The
name
is
peculiar
,
”
said
Albert
,
“
and
perhaps
,
sir
,
you
canrecollect
sufficient
of
the
personal
appearance
of
the
man
to
enable
meat
once
to
decide
upon
that
doubt
.
<EOS>
”“Probably
.
<EOS>
He
is
thin
and
pale
,
with
an
ever
-
shifting
glance
,
and
has
apeculiar
habit
of
continually
moistening
his
lips
with
his
tongue
,
andfrequently
biting
the
under
lip
.
”“It
<EOS>
is
the
same
!

<EOS>
cried
Albert
,
clasping
his
hands
;
<EOS>
“
I
should

<EOS>
”“You
are
sure?”“Quite
sure

and
Ada
will
be
rescued

<EOS>
Sir

we
shall
owe
you
a
debtof
gratitude

never
can
repay
.
<EOS>
Heaven
alone
must
give
you
yourreward

<EOS>
”Learmont
winced
a
little
at
the
idea
of
being
handed
over
to
Heaven
forjudgment
,
and
waving
his
hand
,
he
said,—“Enough
!
<EOS>
I
seek
for
no
reward
.
<EOS>
What
I
do
,
I
do
freely
.
<EOS>
”“I
will
never
now

said
Albert
,
“
until
this
man
comes
,
lose
sight
<EOS>
ofthe
steps
of
your
house

.
<EOS>
”“He
is
sure
to
come

<EOS>
”“And
I
would
not
then
miss
him
for
ten
thousand
worlds

<EOS>
”“I
will
guard
against
any
trifling
accident
:
such
as
your
missing
beinghere
when
he
comes

of
his
eluding

pursuit
;
for
I
will
give
himmoney
,
and
encourage
him
to
come
again

<EOS>
”“You
are
too
kind

said
Albert
,
in
a
broken
voice
.
<EOS>
“Not
a

—
not
a
whit

<EOS>
I
shall
,
however
,
exact
one
promise
from
you

”“Do
<EOS>
but
give
it
a
name
,
sir
.
”“It
is
simply
this
:
that
when
you
have
traced
Jacob
Gray
to
his
home
,
you
will
come
back
to
me
at
once
without
taking
any
further
step

<EOS>
Yourprecipitancy
might
ruin
all
,
whereas
,
if
I
know
where
this
young

to
be
found
,
without
a
doubt
I
can
with
cooler
and
moreextended
judgment
,
because
of
my
more
extended
resources

take
measuresfor
her
recovery

can
not
fail

<EOS>
”“I
will
obey
your
directions
to
the
very
letter

said
Albert
.
<EOS>
“
And
nowI
shall
be
in
terror

”“On
<EOS>
the
other
occasions
of
his
visit
he
always
came
after
sunset

saidLearmont
,
“
and
most
probably
such
will
be
the
case
now

<EOS>
I
should
,
therefore
,
strongly
advise
you
to
sleep
here
from
this
day

out

”Albert
could
almost
have
thrown
himself
at
Learmont
’s
feet
,
so
full
ofjoyful
gratitude
was
he
,
and
he
could
not
find
word
to
express
theoverflowing
feelings
of
his
heart

CHAPTER
LXXXVI.Gray
at
Home.—The
Confession.—A
Walk
through
Westminster
in
Search
of
aWig
.
<EOS>
How
well
Learmont
thought
he
had
managed
his
interview
with
poor
AlbertSeyton
;
and
so
he
had
,
as
far
as
that
interview
went
.
<EOS>
The
results
areyet
to
come
;
but
as
he
sat
alone
,
after
the
young
enthusiastic
Alberthad
left
him
,
a
ghastly
smile
played
upon
his
attenuated
features
,
andhe
muttered—“Fortune
is
repaying
me
now
for
some
of
her
unkindness
.
<EOS>
This
affaircould
not
be
managed
better
than
it
is
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
,
your
doom
issealed
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
chance
of
escape
now
for
you
;
for
all
this
youngman
’s
energies
will
be
exerted
to
discover
your
place
of
abode
,
and
itwill
be
strange
,
indeed
,
if
he
succeed
not
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
I
can
give
himplenty
of
chances
,
and
so
keep
the
game
alive
until
he
is
quitesuccessful
,
for
you
must
come
to
me
,
Jacob
Gray
,
for
money
;
and
eachtime
you
do
so
,
you
shall
return
with
him
upon
your
steps
,
until
youare
fairly
hunted
to
your
lair
,
and
then

—
yes

rid
me
of
you

was
silent
for
some

then
he
muttered,—“Yes

of

when
you

so

I

<EOS>
How
I

with
these

!
<EOS>
First

Gray

too
,
when
mymind

bestow
my
whole
attention
upon

<EOS>
I
will
do
thethieves
of

a
great
favour
,
for
I
will
find
some
plan
ofvengeance
against
him
,
which
shall
cost
him
his
life

<EOS>
Then
the
girl
—
ay
,
the
girl
!
<EOS>
What
of
her
?
<EOS>
Why
,
she
falls
into
my
power
at
once
—
a
mere
,
nameless
orphan
girl
.
<EOS>
Her
safety
will
depend
upon
the
amount
of
hisinformation

<EOS>
Let
her
be
innoxious
through
ignorance
of
her
realposition
,
and
I
<EOS>
—
I
do
n’t
want
to
harm
her
.
<EOS>
Yet
she
must
not
be
near
me;because
<EOS>
she
puts
me
in
mind
of
one
who
—
who
—
I
would
fain
forget

<EOS>
Thisroom

very
gloomy

<EOS>
There
is
an
awful
silence
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
Ihear
no
one
speak
or
move
,
I
—
I
must
go
out
—
out
—
out

<EOS>
”One
<EOS>
of
his
fits
of
terror
came
over
him
and
he
went
backwards
to
thedoor
,
while
his
limbs
trembled
,
and
his
teeth
chattered
with
an
unknowndread
.
<EOS>
Turn
we
now
from
Learmont
to
Jacob
Gray
,
who
was
no
less
miserable
andno
more
happy
in
his
wretched
attic
,
than
was
the
vile
squire
in
hissplendid
mansion
.
<EOS>
Gray
sat
for
a
time
in
deep
and
anxious
thought
,
and
then
he
glideddown
the
stairs
,
for
bells
<EOS>
were
things
unknown
in
that
locality
,
to
askhis
landlady
to
send
for
writing
materials
for
him
.
<EOS>
His
orders
were
very
soon
obeyed
,
and
he
had
on
the
little
ricketytable
which
stood
under
the
small
latticed
window
,
some
ink
in
acracked
tea
cup
,
several
pens
,
and
a
quire
of
paper
.
<EOS>
Then
he
made
a
calculation
of
how
long
it
would
take
him
to
get
twothousand
pounds
in
small
sums
of
Learmont
,
provided
the
squire
shouldrefuse
to
entertain
his
proposal
of
a
large
sum
at
once
,
to
insure
his
,
Gray
’s
,
leaving
the
country
.
<EOS>
Having
satisfied
himself
on
that
head
,
and
come
to
a
conclusion
as
tohow
many
times
he
could
call
,
and
what
sums
he
should
insist
uponhaving
,
he
set
about
the
more
serious
and
important
job
he
purposed;namely
,
to
write
his
confession
.
<EOS>
The
whole
of
the
day
<EOS>
he
remained
at
his
work
,
and
his
feelings
andfears
were
in
a
fearful
state
of
agitation
,
while
he
was
once
morerecording
with
his
own
hands
,
events
,
the
lightest
one
of
which
would
,
if
known
,
consign
him
to
an
ignominious
end
.
<EOS>
The
sun
was
sinking
in
the
west
when
Jacob
Gray
had
finished
his
labourwhich
he
had
pursued
since
the
morning
with
no
intermission
,
save
forone
hasty
meal
,
which
the
landlady
had
brought
him
,
on
her
ownsuggestion
,
for
he
had
been
too
much
engrossed
with
what
he
was
aboutto
think
of
food
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
however
,
he
finished
,
and
with
trembling
hands
he
wrote
thesuperscription
,
“
To
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
”
and
tied
the
whole
firmlyround
with
a
string
.
<EOS>
A
dark
smile
then
came
across
his
face
as
he
muttered,—“Ada
<EOS>
,
you
know
not
what
you
have
lost
by
your
precipitancy
.
<EOS>
I
havethought
of
a
means
of
vengeance
upon
you
.
<EOS>
Here
in
this
paper
,
I
declareyou
illegitimate
.
<EOS>
The
old
priest
,
who
performed
a
marriage
at
Naplesbetween
your
father
and
mother
,
must
be
assuredly
dead
long
since
,
andthere
was
no
witness
but
myself
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
Ha!”He
started
at
the
hollow
echo
of
his
own
laugh
,
and
looked
suspiciouslyaround
him
as
if
he
feared
to
see
some
awful
visitant
who
had
mockedhis
guilty
exultation
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
—
I
am
alone
,
”
he
muttered
.
<EOS>
“
’
Twas
but
an
echo
.
<EOS>
These
old
buildingsare
full
of
them
—
where
now
shall
I
hide
this
precious
and
mostdangerous
document
?
”
<EOS>
He
remained
in
deep
thought
for
some
time
,
andthen
he
made
a
sudden
resolution
that
he
would
keep
it
always
abouthim
,
so
that
it
must
be
found
in
case
of
anything
happening
to
himpersonally
,
and
his
mind
would
be
free
from
apprehension
when
he
wasfrom
home
.
<EOS>
He
then
carefully
unripped
part
of
the
lining
of
his
waistcoat
,
andplaced
the
confession
in
between
the
cloth
and
the
lining
,
after
which
,
by
the
aid
of
several
pins
,
he
firmly
secured
it
in
its
place
.
<EOS>
“It
is
safe
,
”
he
said
,
“
security
against
its
loss
is
all
I
wish
,
notabsolutely
concealment
;
and
yet
,
should
the
villain
Learmont
eversuspect
I
had
this
document
with
me
,
I
should
never
leave
his
housealive
;
but
how
should
he
?
<EOS>
I
have
never
hitherto
had
any
cause
to
fearviolence
at
his
hands
in
his
own
house
;
and
then
he
thinks
I
have
thechild
at
home
.
<EOS>
I
must
consider
,
and
,
perchance
,
change
my
waistcoatwhen
<EOS>
I
favour
you
with
a
visit
,
Master
Learmont
.
”He
<EOS>
then
carefully
searched
his
room
to
discover
some
place
ofconcealment
for
the
confession
,
should
he
feel
disposed
ever
to
leaveit
at
home
,
and
finally
pitched
upon
the
upper
shelf
of
an
oldcupboard
,
in
one
corner
where
was
stowed
away
a
quantity
of
lumber
.
<EOS>
“Yes
,
”
he
muttered
,
“
I
will
,
whenever
I
suspect
there
may
be
danger
incarrying
this
document
abroad
with
me
,
place
it
here
,
it
will
thensurely
be
found
sooner
or
later
,
and
conveyed
to
its
address
.
<EOS>
Now
letme
consider
what
changes
I
can
make
in
my
personal
appearance
,
in
orderfurther
to
ensure
my
safety
from
those
who
are
still
on
the
scent
forme
on
account
of
Vaughan
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
night
was
by
this
time
fairly
set
in
,
and
the
various
objects
ofGray
’s
miserable
apartment
began
to
lose
their
outlines
,
minglingstrangely
together
,
and
in
some
cases
assuming
to
his
alarmedimagination
,
fantastic
shapes
that
made
his
heart
beat
with
fright
.
<EOS>
“I
must
never
be
here
without
lights
,
”
he
muttered
,
“
darkness
itself
isnot
so
bad
in
its
intensity
as
this
kind
of
dim
obscurity
before
thenight
has
fairly
begun
its
reign
.
<EOS>
I
must
never
be
without
lights
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
crept
to
his
door
,
and
opening
it
gently
and
cautiously
,
withouthaving
any
motive
for
so
doing
,
he
slunk
down
the
stairs
as
if
he
wereafraid
of
being
overheard
.
<EOS>
Caution
and
fear
had
become
habits
withJacob
Gray
now
,
and
he
could
not
have
spoken
or
walked
boldly
had
hebeen
ever
so
much
inclined
so
to
do
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
passage
into
the
street
but
through
the
shop
,
and
thewoman
who
was
there
gave
a
great
start
as
Jacob
Gray
came
in
.
<EOS>
“Lor’—sir
<EOS>
,
”
she
said
,
“
I
did
n’t
hear
you
.
<EOS>
”“Not
hear
me
?
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
I
—
I
have
come
quickly
down
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
I
amgoing
out
on
business
,
and
mind
<EOS>
what
I
before
said
to
you
in
case
anyone
should
inquire
for
me
.
<EOS>
”“But
<EOS>
I
do
n’t
even
know
your
name
,
sir
.
”“My
<EOS>
name?”“No
,
sir
,
you
did
n’t
tell
me
.
<EOS>
”Gray
paused
a
moment
,
and
then
he
said,—“My
name
is
Smith
,
”
and
walked
out
of
the
shop
without
waiting
for
ananswer
.
<EOS>
“Smith
,
is
it
?
”
<EOS>
said
the
woman
,
to
herself
;
“
it
’s
about
as
much
Smithas
<EOS>
I
’m
Smith
.
<EOS>
Well
,
it
’s
no
business
of
mine
,
only
I
should
like
<EOS>
toknow
who
he
really
is
;
but
,
howsomever
,
as
long
as
he
pays
his
way
,
<EOS>
that
’s
quite
enough
for
me
—
not
that
I
like
his
looks
at
all
,
<EOS>
oh
,
dear
,
no
—
I
call
him
an
ugly
man
<EOS>
,
I
do.—Well
—
well
,
‘
handsome
is
as
handsomedoes’—that
’s
<EOS>
my
motto!”When
Jacob
Gray
was
fairly
in
the
street
,
he
glanced
cautiously
abouthim
,
and
seeing
no
one
,
he
hugged
himself
in
the
notion
that
he
hadbeen
too
cunning
for
his
enemies
,
and
walked
on
,
keeping
,
however
,
veryclose
to
the
houses
,
so
that
he
walked
in
their
black
shadows
,
andcould
not
be
minutely
remarked
by
any
chance
passenger
.
<EOS>
“A
<EOS>
black
wig
,
”
he
muttered
,
“
will
help
materially
to
disguise
me

Gray
’s
Disguise.—The
Troublesome
Shoemaker
Again.—The
Visit
.
<EOS>
Gray
looked
now
anxiously
right
and
left
for
a
perruquier
’s
,
where
hemight
purchase
a
wig
;
for
contrary
to
the
general
fashion
of
the
day
,
he
had
worn
his
own
hair
and
unpowdered
.
<EOS>
Time
and
great
mental
anxietyhad
,
however
,
very
much
thinned
as
well
as
whitened
his
locks
,
and
ashe
remarked
,
a
black
wig
was
certainly
calculated
to
make
a
verymaterial
difference
in
his
personal
appearance
.
<EOS>
There
were
several
little
mean
barber
’s
shops
in
the
immediateneighbourhood
,
but
they
were
not
possessed
of
such
articles
as
hewished
to
purchase
—
the
sphere
of
their
operations
being
confined
to
theshaving
of
his
majesty
’s
lieges
,
and
particularly
that
portion
of
themwho
only
once
in
a
week
submitted
to
the
tonsorial
operation
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
had
,
therefore
,
much
to
his
dread
,
to
wander
into
a
betterthoroughfare
and
more
respectable
street
,
in
order
to
suit
himself
,
andfinally
he
got
to
Parliament
-
street
before
he
could
see
a
shop
in
whichhe
<EOS>
was
likely
to
get
suited
.
<EOS>
This
he
would
not
venture
into
until
he
was
satisfied
there
was
no
onethere
but
the
master
of
the
shop
,
when
,
more
like
an
apparition
than
awelcome
customer
,
he
glided
in
,
and
asked
for
a
black
wig
.
<EOS>
“Black
wig
,
sir?—Yes
,
sir
—
certainly
,
sir
—
<EOS>
black
wig
,
sir
<EOS>
,
”
replied
theshopkeeper
,
<EOS>
with
great
volubility—“should
say
,
sir
,
you
’ll
look
well
,

,
in
black

<EOS>
”“My

Gray

<EOS>
“

once
curled
the
wig
of
thespeaker
of
the
House
of

,
and
once—”“I
am
in
haste
,
sir
,
”
said
Gray
,
drumming
with
his
fingers
upon
thecounter
.
<EOS>
“Certainly

<EOS>
Business

”Jacob
<EOS>
Gray
took
the
wig
,
and
fitting
it
on
his
head
,
looked
at
himselfattentively
in
a
glass
.
<EOS>
“I
think
this
will
do
,
”
he
said
,
as
he
remarked
with
satisfaction
thealteration
it
made
in
his
aspect
.
<EOS>
“You
look
wonderfully
well
in
that
wig
,
sir
—
upon
my
word
you
do
,
”
saidthe
barber
.
<EOS>
“
I
could
not
have
believed
it

<EOS>
You

twoyears

a

”“Pshaw

said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
The

I
have
little
doubt

<EOS>
”“No

not
a

shadow
of

‘
So

—
but
awig

you
know
,
and
when—”“Peace

said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
<EOS>
The
price?”“The
price
,
sir
;
why
I
should
call
that
wig
uncommonly
cheap
at
twoguineas
,
sir
.
”“There
,
”
said
Gray
,
throwing
the
required
amount
upon
the
counter
<EOS>
,
andthen
immediately
walked
out
of
the
shop
of
the
loquacious
perruquier
.
<EOS>
“Well
,
I
never
,
”
exclaimed
the
man
,
after
his
customer
had
gone
.
<EOS>
“
Mostextraordinary
man
—
horrid
fright
in
that
wig
—
must
be
highwayman!”Jacob
Gray
did
certainly
look
somewhat
different
in
his
wig
;
but
no
onewho
had
ever
known
him
well
could
,
for
a
moment
,
have
doubted
theidentity
of
his
strange
face
,
with
its
peculiar
expression
of
cunning
,
mingled
with
apprehension
.
<EOS>
“Learmont
<EOS>
,
”
he
muttered
,
“
would
have
me
visit
him
in
the
morning
forsome
purpose
,
but
I
will
make
it
night
always
,
until
I
discover
whatcan
possibly
be
his
motive
for
dragging
me
into
daylight
.
<EOS>
”Little
<EOS>
suspecting
then
,
that
he
was
kept
in
view
by
Sir
FrancisHartleton
’s
man
,
from
the
other
side
of
the
way
,
Gray
walked
at
a
rapidpace
towards
Learmont’s
.
<EOS>
The
squire
was
within
,
and
he
gave
a
slight
start
,
when
Gray
wasannounced
;
for
,
at
that
very
moment
,
he
had
been
planning
his
murder
,
when
he
should
,
through
the
instrumentality
of
Albert
Seyton
,
discoverhis
abode
.
<EOS>
The
wig
which
Gray
wore
gave
him
a
strange
look
,
and
Learmont
could
notfor
<EOS>
some
time
divine
what
it
was
that
made
the
remarkable
difference
inJacob
Gray
,
but
kept
his
eyes
fixed
upon
him
with
a
look
of
surprise
,
that
the
other
could
not
but
notice
.
<EOS>

LXXXVIII.Mad
Maud
and
the
Magistrate.—The
Scraps
of
Gray
’s
Confession
.
<EOS>
“Man
proposes
,
but
God
disposes
”
is
a
saying
which
Sir
FrancisHartleton
was
doomed
to
feel
the
truth
of
,
as
regarded
his
projectedexcursion
to
the
Old
Smithy
,
at
Learmont
,
for
firmly
as
he
had
fixed
inhis
own
mind
to
go
,
a
circumstance
occurred
,
which
induced
him
,
at
allevents
,
to
put
off
his
journey
for
some
short
time
.
<EOS>
That
circumstance
was
the
discovery
,
by
the
officers
he
hadcommissioned
to
search
for
her
,
of
poor
Maud
,
apparently
in
the
laststage
of
misery
and
sadness
—
she
had
met
with
some
injury
from
a
runawayhorse
,
and
it
was
in
one
of
the
most
miserable
of
the
many
miserablecourts
about
Drury
-
lane
,
that
the
poor
creature
was
discovered
almoststarved
,
for
those
around
her
could
scarcely
find
the
roughest
means
ofsatisfying
their
own
wants
,
and
the
hunger
of
their
squalid
children
.
<EOS>
The
fact
was
immediately
communicated
to
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
and
<EOS>
he
,
as
soon
as
he
could
get
time
from
his
public
attendance
at
his
office
,
went
himself
to
visit
her
and
take
measures
for
her
comfort
.
<EOS>
The
poor
creature
was
lying
upon
a
miserable
straw
mattress
,
coveredwith
an
old
rug
,
and
the
place
she
was
in
presented
altogether
apicture
of
wretchedness
and
want
.
<EOS>
“How
long
has
she
been
here
?
”
<EOS>
inquired
Sir
Francis
of
an
old
crone
,
whoshowed
him
the
room
.
<EOS>
“Only
last
night
,
”
was
the
reply
.
<EOS>
“
She
’s
as
mad
as
she
can
be
.
<EOS>
Justlook
now
,
sir
.
<EOS>
”The
woman
attempted
to
open
one
of
the
hands
of
Maud
which
was
clutchedtightly
,
but
the
poor
woman
burst
into
a
scream
of
agony
,
crying,—“No
,
no
,
no
<EOS>
—
oh
,
spare
me
that
—
I
found
it
by
the
dead
that

notburn

<EOS>
Help
—

.
<EOS>
Angel
come
and
help
me
now
.
”“Do
<EOS>
not
torment
her
,
”
said
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
“
What
has
she
in
her
hand!”“Only
some
crumpled
up
bits
of
paper
,
sir
,
but
she
thinks
a
mighty
dealof

em
.
”“Go
and
fetch
me

man

SirFrancis

<EOS>
“
Here

<EOS>
”The
woman
with
a
profusion
of
thanks
went
on
her
message
,
and
thehumane
magistrate
sat
down
by
the
miserable
couch
of
the
sufferer
.
<EOS>
“Maud

Maud

”
he
said
,
close
to
her
ear
.
<EOS>
“Who
calls

<EOS>
Who
calls

”
<EOS>
she
muttered
.
<EOS>
“A
friend
,
”
said
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
She
shuddered
,
as
in
a
low
plaintive
voice
she
said,—“No
,
no

poor
mad
Maud
has
no
friend

<EOS>
Heaven
will
release
her
whenAndrew

the

set
on
by
Andrew
Britton

<EOS>
No

no
—
fire
will
not
burn

a

and
so
I
found
thepapers
—
most
precious

rare

<EOS>
The
angel
’s
flame
is
on
one
of
them
—
<EOS>
thatwould
I
not
part
with
for
a
thousand
worlds

”“Where
<EOS>
got
you
them?”“At
the
old
house
on
the
marches

<EOS>
Ha
,

—
I
—
I
saw
the
glare

—
the
ruddy
hue
of
the
fire
,
and
I
knew
then
that
Andrew
Brittonwas
trying
once
again
to

<EOS>

he
can’t

rare

Britton
too

to

”The
door
now
opened

and
the
woman
approached
with
a
medical
man
.
<EOS>
“I
am
Sir

said
the

,
rising
,
“

surgeon
bowed
and
proceeded
to
examine
the
patient

<EOS>
“She

he
said

as
ifshe
had
been
a
child
,
down
the
staircase
,
and
placed
her
in
the
coachwhich
stood
at
the
entrance
of
the
court
.
<EOS>
He
then
courteously
took
leave
of
the
surgeon
,
after
making
anappointment
with
him
a
few
hours
after
at
his
own
house
,
and
got
intothe
coach
with
Maud
,
having
directed
the
driver
to
his
house
atWestminster
.
<EOS>
Careful
not
to
disturb
her
slumber
,
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
unclosed
thehand
of
poor
Maud
,
and
found
crumpled
into
a
hard
ball
,
a
number
ofsmall
scraps
of
paper
,
on
which
were
words
and
disjointed
sentences
.
<EOS>
That
the
few
words
he
could
find
were
deeply
interesting
to
themagistrate
might
have
been
gathered
from
the
expressions
of
his
face
<EOS>
ashe
read
them
.
<EOS>
His
hands
trembled
with
excitement
as
piece
after
piecehe
spread
open
and
perused
.
<EOS>
“Here
is
important
matter
,
”
he
said
,
“
but
it
is
sadly
out
of
joint
.
<EOS>
This
must
be
some
remnant
of
a
paper
containing
a
strange
history
,
andhere
is
,
it
seems
,
the
name
of
Ada
.
<EOS>
I
must
more
at
my
leisure
examinethese
.
<EOS>
Thank
Heaven
they
have
fallen
into
no
other
hands
than
mine
.
”He
<EOS>
then
placed
the
torn
scraps
carefully
in
his
pocket
-
book
;
andlooking
from
the
coach
window
<EOS>
,
he
found
that
they
were
nearly
at
hishouse
.
<EOS>
He
carefully
lifted
the
still
sleeping
Maud
from
the
coach
,
andcarried
her
to
a
comfortable
bedroom
,
resigning
her
to
the
care
of
hiswife
and
the
astonished
Ada
,
while
he
hurried
to
his
own
study
todecipher
the
mysterious

CHAPTER

LXXXIX.The
<EOS>
Revelation.—Learmont
<EOS>
’s
<EOS>
Deep
Duplicity.—Albert
<EOS>
’s
Gratitude
.
<EOS>
The
morning
found
Albert
Seyton
true
to
his
appointed
time
atLearmont
’s
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
long
before
he
could
think
of
knocking
foradmittance
,
being
ashamed
of
so
much
eagerness
,
he
had
arrived
in
theimmediate
vicinity
,
and
wandered
restlessly
about
until
the
hour
shouldcome
.
<EOS>
The
hope
,
so
suddenly
springing
up
as
it
had
,
in
the
midst
of
hisdespair
of
again
beholding
Ada
,
through
the
exertions
of
his
newpatron
,
had
,
in
the
endless
mass
of
surmises
and
conjectures
it
hadgiven
rise
to
,
banished
sleep
from
his
pillow
,
and
it
was
not
till
thefirst
faint
gleam
of
the
coming
day
poured
in
at
his
bedroom
window
,
that
he
became
conscious
of
the
rapid
flight
of
time
.
<EOS>
To
attempt
to
sleep
then
,
he
thought
,
was
useless
,
and
besides
he
mightoversleep
himself
,
and
appear
to
be
negligent
of
his
appointment
withthe
rich
man
,
who
had
promised
to
do
so
much
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
thereforerose
,
and
as
we
have
said
,
paced
about
the
street
in
the
vicinity
ofLearmont
’s
house
,
little
dreaming
that
he
was
taking
so
much
troubleand
feeling
so
much
elation
for
Ada
’s
worst
and
bitterest
enemy
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
thought
,
although
he
was
too
soon
,
he
might
knock
foradmittance
,
and
with
a
nervous
hand
he
seized
the
old
massive
knockerat
Learmont
’s
door
.
<EOS>
He
was
speedily
admitted
,
and
his
heart
bounded
with
delight
,
<EOS>
when
,
inanswer
to
his
questions
,
he
was
told
that
Learmont
was
up
and
in
hisown
private
room
.
<EOS>
With
a
palpitating
heart
,
Albert
followed
the
servantwho
went
to
announce
him
.
<EOS>
He
heard
the
deep
sepulchral
tones
ofLearmont
’s
voice
say—“Come
in
!
”
<EOS>
and
he
thought—“How
much
now
one
may
be
deceived
in
estimating
character
.
<EOS>
Who
wouldsuppose
that
voice
belonged
to
so
good
a
man
?
<EOS>
And
the
countenance
,
too
,
of
this
squire
,
it
is
certainly
not
prepossessing
,
and
yet
what
a
kindheart
<EOS>
he
has!”Albert
Seyton
was
a
far
better
physiognomist
than
he
thought
himself
.
<EOS>
In
another
moment
he
was
in
the
presence
of
one
who
,
most
on
earth
,
hefelt
grateful
to
—
but
really
the
man
who
,
most
on
earth
,
he
had
reasonto
entertain
the
greatest
indignation
at
.
<EOS>
Learmont
received
his
young
secretary
cautiously
;
and
,
turning
to
theservant
,
then
he
said,—“Lay
breakfast
for
me
and
this
gentleman
in
the
small
morning
room
.
<EOS>
”The
servant
bowed
down
to
the
very
ground
,
and
closed
the
door
afterhim
so
gently
and
quietly
,
that
one
could
hardly
suppose
Learmont
wasanything
but
some
piece
of
workmanship
that
any
sudden
noise
orconcussion
of
the
air
would
destroy
.
<EOS>
“You
are
early
,
”
said
Learmont
to
Albert
,
with
a
sickly
smile
.
<EOS>
“I
fear
,
sir
,
”
said
Seyton
,
“
that
I
have
intruded
upon
you
too
soon
,
but
<EOS>
my
great
anxiety—”“Yes
,
yes
,
I
have
not
forgotten
,
”
interrupted
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“
Will
it
pleaseyou
to
describe
to
me
this
man
,
Jacob
Gray
,
again
,
who
kept
the
—
thegirl
in
such
a
state
of
bondage?”“Certainly
,
sir
.
<EOS>
About
the
middle
height—”“Humph!”“Pale
to
sallowness
;
a
small
,
twinkling
eye
,
bespeaking
more
cunningthan
courage
.
<EOS>
”“Ay
<EOS>
—
ay
.
<EOS>
”“A
<EOS>
skulking
,
timid
walk
,
as
if
ever
afraid
of
question
or
pursuit
.
<EOS>
”“’Tis
<EOS>
very
strange
.
<EOS>
”“Sir?”“I
say
,
’
tis
very
strange
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
quite
a
surprise
for
you
instore
.
<EOS>
”“A
surprise
,
sir?”“Yes
.
<EOS>
You
must
hear
it
manfully
.
<EOS>
Can
you
stand
the
shock
of
suddennews?”Albert
<EOS>
felt
at
this
moment
as
if
all
his
fond
hopes
were
suddenlyblasted
.
<EOS>
He
clasped
hands
,
and
said—“The
news
is
bad?”“I
said
not
so
.
<EOS>
”“Then
<EOS>
—
then—”“Not
to
keep
you
longer
in
suspense
,
young
sir
,
I
will
tell
you
of
thestrangest
circumstance
that
ever
I
encountered
.
<EOS>
The
man
who
came
to
mefor
pecuniary
assistance
—
that
very
man
who
I
,
from
charitable
motives
,
wished
you
to
follow—”Albert
drew
his
breath
short
and
thick
,
as
he
gasped
,
and
<EOS>
said,—“Go
on
,
sir
,
I
pray
you
.
<EOS>
That
man?”“Is
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
”“God
of
Heaven
!
<EOS>
My
heart
told
me
so
.
<EOS>
”“Yes
,
he
and
Jacob
Gray
are
one
.
<EOS>
”“This
is
Heaven
’s
<EOS>
work!”“Of
course
.
<EOS>
”“Most
<EOS>
providential!”“Certainly
.
<EOS>
”“Oh
,
sir
,
you
have
indeed
lifted
me
from
an
abyss
of
despair
to
apinnacle
of
happiness
that
makes
me
giddy

<EOS>
Thank

<EOS>
I
met
with
aheart
like
yours
,
and
when
I
wish
you
all
the
happiness
you
reallydeserve
,
I
am
saying
much
,
very
much
.
”“Thank
<EOS>
you
,
”
said
Learmont
,
coldly
.
<EOS>
“
I
was
much
struck
with
yourdescription
of
Jacob
Gray
—
it
seemed
to
fit
the
man
who
had
called
hereexactly
;
but
before
I
would
agitate
you
by
vain
hopes
and
fears
,
I
madeinquiry
among
my
household
,
and
found
my
suspicions
verified
,
for
,
onmore
than
one
occasion
,
he
has
owned
to
them
that
Gray
was
his
name

”“Oh
,
sir

”
cried
Albert
,
“
I
will
follow
that
man
to
the
world
’s
end!”“Do
nothing
rashly

said
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“
Follow
him

up

”“How

I
express
my

<EOS>
said
Albert
,
with
trembling
eagerness

<EOS>
“That
I
can

You

”“I

Learmont

“Oh

”“That

”“Oh

added
Albert
,
“

”“Heed

enough

<EOS>
You
will
remain
here

<EOS>
will
,
sir

if
it
please

I
will

<EOS>
”“Far

said
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“
Believe

<EOS>
”Learmont
<EOS>
now
rose
,
and
Albert
Seyton
,
construing
that
into
a
hint
to
begone
,
rose
too
.
<EOS>
The
squire
rung
the
bell
,
and
upon
the
appearance
of
aservant
,
he
said,—“See
that
proper
accommodation
is
provided
for
this
gentleman
.
<EOS>
He
willremain
an
inmate
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
”Albert
left
the
room
,
and
followed
the
servant
into
a
comfortableapartment
,
which
commanded
a
pretty
view
of
the
garden
.
<EOS>
A
thought
now
suddenly
struck
him
that
he
might
as
well
let
the
servantknow
,
in
case
of
the
sudden
appearance
of
Gray
,
when
Learmont
might
befrom
home
,
that
he
,
Albert
Seyton
,
was
to
be
informed
of
the
fact
,
andhe
<EOS>
said,—“Do
<EOS>
you
know
a
man
named
Gray?”“Gray
,
sir?”“Yes
,
a
mendicant
.
<EOS>
”The
servant
looked
hard
at
Seyton
,
and
muttered
to
himself,—“That
’s
a
feeler
to
see
if
I
gossips
about
the
squire
’s
affairs
.
<EOS>
”“A
thin
,
pale
man
,
”
added
Albert
,
who
thought
the
servant
wasendeavouring
to
recollect
.
<EOS>
“No
<EOS>
I
never
saw
him
,
sir
—
never
saw
nobody
,
sir
—
never
mean
to
see
.
<EOS>
”“What
<EOS>
do
you
mean?”“We
never
sees
nobody
in
this
house
,
sir
.
<EOS>
We
never
talks
about
master’saffairs
,
we
don’t
.
”“Oh
,
very
well
,
”
said
Albert
.
<EOS>
“
I
have
no
wish
to
induce
you
to
do
so
,
<EOS>
Iam
sure
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
further
from
my
intention
.
<EOS>
”“No
,
sir
<EOS>
,
”
said
the
servant,“I
am
your
master
’s
most
devoted
friend
.
<EOS>
”“Yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
”Albert
turned
away
,
for
he
saw
that
by
some
means
he
had
excited
thesuspicions
of
the
man
,
and
he
determined
now
to
say
no
more
to
him
atall
.
<EOS>
The
day
passed
off
to
Albert
strangely
,
and
when
the
evening
came
,
hewas
rejoiced
that
by
so
many
hours
he
was
nearer
the
completion
of
hishopes
,
for
he
looked
upon
the
scheme
of
following
Gray
home
as
certainto
bring
him
once
more
to
Ada
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
he
would
pace
his
room
for
an
hour
or
more
in
a
delightfulreverie
,
dreaming
of
future
happiness
with
Ada
,
and
fondly
imaginingthat
he
was
gazing
on
those
eyes
which
to
him
were
glimpses
of
heaven
.
<EOS>
Then
again
he
would
become
despondent
,
and
fancy
her
at
the
mercy
ofJacob
Gray
,
who
to
rid
himself
of
uneasiness
on
her
account
,
might

The
anxious
lover
would

torture
himself
awhile
with

until
hope
refreshed
sprung
up
again
in

CHAPTER
XC.The
<EOS>
Last
<EOS>
Meeting.—Mutual
<EOS>
Cunning.—The
Squire
and
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
The
night
was
dark
and
a
lowering
one
,
and
not
a
star
appeared
in
theblue
vault
of
heaven
—
<EOS>
a
raw
wind
swept
along
the
river
,
and
thence
upthe
narrow
winding
streets
upon
its
banks
,
slamming
doors
,
and
now
andthen
catching
the
hat
of
a
too
confiding
passenger
,
and
tossing
it
intothe
roadway
.
<EOS>
Learmont
sat
alone
in
the
room
he
usually
occupied
,
but
he
heard
notthe
sighing
of
the
wind
,
nor
cared
for
the
unpropitious
aspect
of
thenight
—
his
thoughts
were
all
bent
upon
one
subject
,
and
that
was
thenear
prospect
he
now
had
of
achieving
the
destruction
of
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
Adark
malignant
smile
lit
up
his
features
,
and
as
he
played
upon
therichly
-
carved
table
at
which
he
sat
with
his
fingers
,
he
muttered
indisjointed
sentences
the
subject
of
his
reveries
.
<EOS>
“So
<EOS>
they
say
that
Heaven
always
confounds
the
wicked
—
those
who
strivefor
power
and
wealth
,
by
other
than
the
usual
channels
—
hard
work
orsycophancy
<EOS>
—
be
it
so
:
methinks
that
I
,
Squire
Learmont
,
must
havegrievously
mistaken
my
own
actions
,
when
I
thought
them
of
a
fearfulnature
,
for
surely
now
Heaven
smiles
upon
all
my
plans
and
projects
.
<EOS>
Itwould
seem
as
if
this
lover
,
this
wild
enthusiastic
boy
,
was
purposelythrown
in
my
way
to
be
a
weapon
in
my
hands
against
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
Theconfession
—
ah
,
the
confession
.
<EOS>
Dare
I
even
trust
him
to
bring
me
that?Yes
—
yet
some
damning
accident
might
give
him
a
glimpse
of
its
contents
,
or
he
might
be
seized
with
some
sudden
whim
,
especially
beingdisappointed
in
his
main
object
of
taking
the
confession
to
him
to
whomit
is
really
addressed
.
<EOS>
No
,
the
confession
I
will
myself
secure
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
myself
.
<EOS>
Britton
shall
do
the
deed
of
blood
,
and
when
’
tis
finished
,
Iwill
take
the
confession
,
and
it
would
then
be
far
better
to
take
thelife
of
Gray
away
from
his
home
.
<EOS>
Here
,
even
here
it
might
be
done
.
<EOS>
Itshall
.
<EOS>
Albert
Seyton
shall
dog
his
footsteps
home
,
and
his
next
visithere
he
dies
,
while
I
proceed
to
his
abode
and
possess
myself
of
thedangerous
document
he
leaves
behind
him
.
<EOS>
”How
<EOS>
different
were
the
reflections
of
Albert
Seyton
to
those
ofLearmont
,
and
yet
they
ran
much
in
the
same
channel
and
the
chiefpersonage
on
whom
they
turned
<EOS>
was
the
same
—
<EOS>
namely
,
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
Perhapsnever
had
two
persons
,
amid
the
whole
population
of
London
,
waited
withsuch
great
anxiety
for
the
arrival
of
a
third
,
as
did
Squire
Learmontand
Albert
Seyton
for
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
It
was
well
for
the
success
of
the
plan
of
operations
against
Gray
thata
part
of
it
had
been
for
Albert
to
remain
in
the
house
until
Grayshould
come
,
for
the
crafty
Jacob
had
made
up
his
mind
,
whenever
hevisited
the
squire
to
take
him
by
surprise
as
much
as
possible
,
bycalling
at
odd
times
;
sometimes
two
days
consecutively
,
and
sometimesearly
in
the
evening
,
and
sometimes
very
late
,
so
that
Learmont
shouldnever
be
able
to
count
upon
his
coming
,
or
be
surprised
at
any
longabsence
he
should
make
,
nor
deceived
into
a
false
security
,
should
henot
see
him
for
a
considerable
period
.
<EOS>
In
pursuance
of
this
plan
,
it
so
happened
that
about
nine
o’clock
,
asthe
squire
was
still
in
deep
thought
,
Jacob
Gray
was
announced
.
<EOS>
Learmont
started
to
his
feet
with
a
suddenness
that
alarmed
theservant
,
who
made
a
precipitate
retreat
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
“Hold
!
<EOS>
”
cried
the
squire
.
<EOS>
“
How
dare
you
leave
the
room
without
yourorders?”“I
—
I
—
thought
—
your
worship
,
that
—
I
—
I
—
thought
,
your
worship—”“Fool
!
”
<EOS>
muttered
Learmont
.
<EOS>
He
then
hastily
tore
off
a
small
scrap
of
paper
from
some
that
laybefore
him
,
and
wrote
on
it
the
words—“J.G.
is
here
.
<EOS>
”“Give
<EOS>
this
,
”
he
said
,
“
to
the
young
gentleman
,
my
secretary
,
instantly
.
<EOS>
”“Yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
”“And
then
bring
Gray
to
me
here
.
<EOS>
”The
servant
bowed
,
and
retired
,
leaving
Learmont
standing
in
the
middleof
the
room
with
such
an
expression
of
triumph
on
his
face
,
that
whenGray
made
his
appearance
,
which
he
did
almost
immediately
,
he
startedback
a
pace
or
two
in
surprise
,
an
action
which
was
nearly
imitated
byLearmont
,
for
Gray
looked
so
very
different
in
his
wig
,
that
Learmontquite
started
at
first
sight
of
him
.
<EOS>
The
two
looked
at
each
other
for
several
moments
without
speaking
,
thenGray
,
in
his
quick
sneering
tone
,
said,—“Your
worship
will
get
used
to
my
wig
in
the
course
of
time
.
”“Probably
,
”
said
Learmont
,
“
if
you
live
so
long
.
<EOS>
”“Live
<EOS>
so
long?”“Ay
,
Jacob
Gray
;
I
never
saw
you
look
so
bad
in
all
my
life
.
<EOS>
You
mustbe
nearer
death
than
you
think
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
—
I
am
very
well
,
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
I
hope
yet
to
attend
your
funeral
,
andreceive
something
commensurate
with
our
ancient
friendship
through
themedium
of
your
will
.
<EOS>
”“You
are
kind
and
obliging
,
”
said
Learmont
,
“
<EOS>
but
I
do
n’t
intend
to
diefirst
,
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
”Gray
smiled
in
his
usual
sickly
disagreeable
manner
,
and
then
drawinghimself
a
seat
,
he
sat
down
by
Learmont
,
and
said,—“A
truce
to
jesting
,
squire
.
<EOS>
Have
you
thought
further
of
my
propositionto
you?”“Scarcely
,
”
said
Learmont
;
“
<EOS>
and
yet
I
have
a
notion
of
entertaining
it
.
<EOS>
”“You
have?”“I
have
.
”“Believe
<EOS>
me
’
tis
the
best
and
safest
plan
.
<EOS>
”“If
<EOS>
I
understand
you
rightly
,
you
offer
to
surrender
all
that
may
makemy
life
now
a
constant
source
of
anxiety
and
torment
for
one
large
sumof
money
paid
to
you
at
once
.
<EOS>
”“I
do
,
”
said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“The
child
—
and
—
the
confession?”“The
confession
and
the
child
that
was
,
but
you
forget
the
lapse
ofyears
;
that
child
is
a
child
no
longer
,
but
at
an
age
to
be
dangerous
.
<EOS>
The
slightest
hint
from
me
would
raise
a
spirit
in
that
offspring
ofyour—”“Hush
,
”
said
Learmont
,
vehemently
;
“
Jacob
Gray
,
even
here
I
will
takeyour
life
if
you
dare
to
mention
him
<EOS>
you
are
about
to
revert
to
evennow
.
<EOS>
”“I
will
alter
my
form
of
speech
more
to
your
liking
,
squire
,
”
saidGray
;
“
I
meant
that
one
word
of
mine
would
rouse
up
against
you
a
moreformidable
opponent
than
any
you
have
ever
met
with
.
<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
for
some
thousands
of
pounds
you
will
leave
me
free?”“I
will
.
<EOS>
”“But
<EOS>
,
cunning
Master
Gray
,
you
know
your
wit
is
keener
than
mine,”sneered
Learmont
;
“
and
how
am
I
to
be
assured
of
your
faith?”“You
shall
see
me
on
shipboard
,
”
said
Gray
;
“
with
my
own
hands
,
then
,
Iwill
hand
you
my
confession
.
”“Suppose
<EOS>
there
were
two
copies?”“On
my
faith
,
squire
,
you
are
too
suspicious
—
far
too
suspicious
.
<EOS>
”“Have
<EOS>
I
no
cause?”“None
<EOS>
whatever
.
<EOS>
It
is
my
interest
as
well
as
yours
that
the
past
shouldbe
forgotten
.
<EOS>
What
could
I
gain
by
denouncing
you?”“Nothing
but
a
barren
triumph
of
man
over
man
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
Jacob
Gray
,
that
I
will
trust
you
.
<EOS>
But
permit
me
,
between
this
time
and
when
weshall
meet
again
,
to
consider
of
the
subject
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
pray
you
do
so
,
”
said
Gray
,
who
was
so
elated
at
the
idea
of
gettingLearmont
to
pay
him
largely
,
for
the
doubtful
advantage
of
his
absence
,
that
he
almost
forgot
his
usual
caution
in
his
extreme
eagerness
<EOS>
toinduce
a
compliance
with
his
wishes
.
<EOS>
“You
will
feel
so
much
at
ease
,
”
he
added
,
“
when
I
am
gone
from
Englandnever
to
return
,
and
many
of
the
fears
that
now
disturb
your
mind
willat
once
terminate
.
<EOS>
”“I
hope
to
terminate
them
so
,
”
said
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“Such
hope
is
wisely
grounded
,
”
replied
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
You
have
but
<EOS>
then
to
getrid
of
the
drunken
sot
,
Andrew
Britton
,
and
a
career
of
brilliantenjoyment
will
await
you
,
unchecked
by
one
lingering
doubt
of
yoursafety
.
<EOS>
”“’Twere
a
blessed
state
,
”
said
Learmont
,
“
and
one
I
have
much
strivento
obtain
.
<EOS>
Now
,
however
,
I
do
certainly
begin
to
see
some
light
amidthe
gloom
which
had
surrounded
me
.
<EOS>
”“Your
<EOS>
fortunes
are
in
your
hands
,
”
said
Gray
;
“
I
am
tired
of
this
modeof
life
.
<EOS>
Give
me
five
thousand
pounds
,
and
let
me
go
in
peace
.
<EOS>
”“Your
<EOS>
demand
is
large
.
<EOS>
”“Nay
,
a
mere
trifle
<EOS>
when
compared
with
the
revenues
of
your
estates
.
<EOS>
”“Well
,
<EOS>
well
,
I
will
,
as
I
tell
you
,
consider
;
and
I
have
a
fervent
hopethat
our
next
time
of
meeting
maybe
our
last
,
or
,
at
all
events
,
thatafter
that
,
there
need
be
but
<EOS>
one
more
final
interview
.
<EOS>
”“Exactly
,
”
said
Gray
;
“
it
is
in
your
own
power
,
when
you
please
to
getrid
of
me
for
ever
.
<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
the
young
claimant
of
all
<EOS>
I
am
now
worth?”“Certainly
—
<EOS>
a
pistol
or
a
knife
will
get
you
rid
of
all
trouble
uponthat
head
,
squire
.
”“Certainly
,
but
you
ought
to
do
so
much
for
me
as
part
of
your
bargain,”“No
,
no
,
”
said
Gray
,
confused
;
“
I
<EOS>
—
I
cannot
—
<EOS>
my
nerves
will
not
permitme
,
I
really
can
not

<EOS>
If
you
shrink
yourself
from
the
deed

why
there
isAndrew
Britton
,
the
savage
smith
,
who
revels
and
rejoices
in
blood
.
<EOS>
Hewill
do
the
deed
for
you
without
a
murmur
.
<EOS>
”“You
think
then
that
Britton
is
the
best
man
I
can
employ
to
commit
amurder?”“I
<EOS>
do
.
<EOS>
”“Then
<EOS>
he
shall
have
the
job
.
<EOS>
”Gray
smiled
to
himself
as
he
thought
,
“
You
must
first
wrest
your
preyfrom
the
hands
of
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
—
no
easy
task
!
”
<EOS>
Then
he
saidaloud,—“You
are
now
on
the
right
path

to
pursue
it

<EOS>
”“I
do
begin
to

so

said
Learmont
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
now
rose
,
and
said,—“I
will
bid
you
adieu
,
squire
,
but
being
rather
pressed
for
money
.
<EOS>
Iwill
trouble
you
for
fifty
pounds

<EOS>
”“Fifty
<EOS>
pounds?”“Ay

but
a
small
instalment
of
the
thousands
.
<EOS>
Agree
,
at
our
nextmeeting
,
to
my
terms

and
I
will
deduct
this
fifty
pounds
from
thegross
sum
<EOS>
I
am
to
receive
.
<EOS>
”“As
<EOS>
you

said
Learmont
;
“
<EOS>

,
Jacob

I
will
not
give

large
a

<EOS>
”“Know

<EOS>
Take

<EOS>
”“Has

<EOS>
muttered
Gray
.
<EOS>
“It
<EOS>
has

said
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“Know

England
suddenly
and

interrupted
Learmont
,
“
I
know

it

”“I
<EOS>
do
,
but
the
money
must
be
sufficient

”“It
<EOS>
is
most
ample

<EOS>
”Gray
looked
in
the
calm
pale
face
of
the
squire
for
a
moment
or
two
insilence
,
then
he
took
the
ten
guineas
which
Learmont
had
laid
upon
thetable
,
and
with
a
bitterness
of
tone
,
which
he
in
vain
tried
toconceal
,
he
said,—“It
matters
not
,
ten
pounds
or
a
hundred
,
the
result
must
be
the
same;I
must
and
will
have
a

sum

I
am

have
it

Farewell

early

<EOS>
Farewell

<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
left
the
room
,
and
Learmont
looked
after
him
with
such
a
smile
as
hehad
not
worn
for
years
,
and
muttered,—“Have
<EOS>
I
begun
my
independence
too
early

<EOS>
Humph

by

halfdozen
hours

Seyton
after
he
had
received
Learmont
’s
shortintimation
of
Jacob
Gray
’s
avowal
knew
scarcely
any
bounds
,
and
itappeared
to
him
an
age
before
Gray
passed
across
the
hall
to
leave
thehouse
.
<EOS>
Albert
had
taken
his
station
just
within
a
small
waiting
-
room
whichcommanded
a
view
of
the
great
staircase
,
and
at
the
first
sight
ofJacob
Gray
descending
;
his
emotions
were
so
powerful
that
he
wascompelled
to
sit
down
to
recover
his
composure
,
during
which
briefperiod
,
Gray
crossed
the
hall
,
and
passed
into
the
street
with
a
rapidpace
.
<EOS>
The
necessity
,
however
,
for
immediate
action
soon
roused
Albert
to
someexertion
,
and
being
fully
equipped
for
the
streets
,
he
made
but
onebound
across
the
hall
,
to
the
great
astonishment
of
the
servants
,
andreached
the
street
just
in
time
to
see
Gray
turn
the
first
corner
.
<EOS>
The
emotion
of
Albert
Seyton
had
now
died
away
,
and
he
kept
but
oneobject
in
view
,
and
that
was
the
restoration
to
him
of
his
much
-
lovedAda
,
as
a
consequence
of
his
successful
pursuit
of
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
He
became
calm
,
cool
,
and
firm
—
every
nerve
seemed
stretched
to
itsutmost
tension
,
and
with
a
speed
that
was
really
tremendous
,
he
clearedthe
distance
between
Learmont
’s
door
and
the
corner
at
which
Gray
haddisappeared
.
<EOS>
The
object
of
his
anxious
pursuit
was
but
half
a
dozen
paces
in
advanceof
him
,
when
Albert
turned
cautiously
the
corner
,
and
the
young
manstepped
into
a
doorway
,
to
allow
him
to
proceed
to
a
safer
distance
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
a
curious
study
for
any
one
more
free
to
makeobservations
than
was
Albert
Seyton
,
to
mark
the
curious
,
suspiciousmanner
in
which
Gray
went
along
the
streets
.
<EOS>
His
home
was
really
notten
minutes
’
walk
from
Learmont
<EOS>
’s
house
;
but
something
on
this
oneevening
,
in
particular
,
seemed
to
possess
him
with
a
notion
of
extremecaution
,
and
when
he
had
left
Learmont
’s
door
,
instead
of
turning
tothe
left
,
which
he
should
have
done
,
and
then
crossed
Whitehall
,
heturned
to
the
right
,
with
a
resolution
of
making
a
detour
through
theintricacies
of
Westminster
before
he
reached
his
home
.
<EOS>
He
went
on
till
he
emerged
into
Parliament
-
street
,
for
he
had
a
greatnotion
of
how
much
he
was
disguised
in
his
new
wig
,
and
he
did
not
mindventuring
into
a
crowded
thoroughfare
so
much
as
he
did
before
.
<EOS>
Crossing
then
by
the
House
of
Lords
,
he
passed
Westminster
Abbey
,
andwith
a
slow
,
measured
step
,
sauntered
down
Abingdon
-
street
.
<EOS>
Once
or
twice
Gray
had
wheeled
round
to
look
behind
him
<EOS>
so
suddenlyupon
his
heels
,
that
had
not
Albert
ever
kept
at
a
respectful
distance
,
and
being
favoured
by
the
darkness
,
he
must
have
been
discovered
;
butGray
passed
on
again
without
suspicion
,
for
Seyton
on
these
occasionshad
not
shown
any
signs
of
trepidation
,
or
wish
to
hide
himself
,
buthad
walked
carelessly
forward
with
a
determination
,
however
,
in
his
ownmind
,
of
knocking
at
some
door
rather
than
come
close
up
to
Gray
.
<EOS>
The
wily
Jacob
,
however
,
did
not
once
wait
for
the
listless
passengerto
pass
him
,
so
that
Albert
was
not
reduced
to
that
troublesomealternative
,
and
the
pursuit
continued
the
whole
length
ofAbingdon
-
street
,
without
any
circumstance
occurring
to
awaken
suspicionin
Gray
’s
mind
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
,
however
,
altogether
so
with
Albert
,
for
inParliament
-
street
he
had
noticed
a
man
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
wayto
be
keeping
his
eye
upon
Jacob
Gray
,
and
when
they
passed
the
abbey
,
the
same
man
appeared
again
,
and
it
was
evident
to
Albert
that
hewasn’t
the
only
one
who
was
dogging
Jacob
Gray
to
his
home
.
<EOS>
Had
he
but
known
that
this
was
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
<EOS>
’s
man
,
how
muchfuture
trouble
and
uneasiness
would
have
been
spared
him
;
but
as
itwas
,
he
only
saw
in
the
circumstance
an
additional
cause
for
alarm
onAda
’s
account
,
for
he
could
not
possibly
divine
what
motive
any
one
buthimself
could
have
in
tracing
Gray
to
his
home
,
unless
it
were
that
thevillain
had
been
making
similar
applications
to
the
one
<EOS>
he
,
Albert
,
fully
believed
he
had
made
to
Learmont
,
and
some
other
person
wasfollowing
him
home
with
a
similar
motive
to
Learmont
<EOS>
’s
,
when
he
firstrequested
him
,
Albert
,
to
trace
the
man
’s
footsteps
.
<EOS>
This
might
or
might
not
be
the
motive
of
the
spy
upon
Jacob
Gray
,
butone
thing
soon
became
certain
,
and
that
was
,
that
the
stranger
began
toregard
Albert
with
as
much
suspicion
and
distrust
as
Albert
regardedhim
,
and
probably
never
were
two
people
engaged
in
one
object
,
moreangry
at
each
other
just
then
,
than
Albert
Seyton
and
the
spy
of
SirFrancis
Hartleton
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
would
have
almost
fallen
dead
in
the
street
with
fright
<EOS>
,
hadhe
imagined
for
one
moment
the
predicament
he
was
in
—
but
,
on
thecontrary
,
he
went
on
applauding
himself
upon
his
own
cleverness
;
and
,
perhaps
,
never
had
he
felt
so
satisfied
of
his
superiority
in
point
<EOS>
ofcunning
over
all
his
enemies
than
he
did
that
night
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
shall
yet
,
after
all
that
is
past
,
”
he
thought
,
“
receive
a
large
sumof
money
,
and
be
an
independent
man
,
while
I
adequately
punish
all
whohave
<EOS>
given
me
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
The
only
men
I
can
not
crush
are
thescoundrels
who
robbed
me
after
my
little
adventure
with
Vaughan
.
<EOS>
I
seeno
ready
way
of
being
revenged
upon
them
,
and
my
only
consolation
isthat
,
sooner
or
later
,
they
are
sure
to
come
to
the
gallows
.
<EOS>
”Hugging
himself
with
his
idea
<EOS>
,
although
,
metaphorically
speaking
,
he
,
Gray
,
may
be
said
to
have
had
the
rope
then
about
his
neck
,
the
villainpassed
on
by
the
low
swampy
bit
of
ground
on
which
the
Penitentiary
isnow
built
.
<EOS>
He
then
paused
a
few
moments
,
as
if
in
doubt
which
way
he
should
gonext
,
and
Albert
Seyton
crouched
down
by
some
timber
which
lay
upon
theground
,
while
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
<EOS>
’s
man
drew
back
into
the
shadow
ofsome
irregular
small
,
wretched
dwellings
which
stood
near
the
water’sedge
.
<EOS>
Gray
did
not
keep
them
long
in
suspence
,
for
after
a
slight
reflection
,
he
determined
upon
adopting
his
favourite
plan
of
reaching
home
,
with
,
at
all
events
,
the
nearest
approach
to
a
certainty
of
not
beingfollowed
,
namely
,
by
water
.
<EOS>
He
accordingly
walked
down
to
some
stairsby
the
river
side
,
passing
within
arm
’s
length
of
Albert
,
and
jumpedinto
a
wherry
in
which
was
a
boy
lying
fast
asleep
.
<EOS>
Gray
awoke
the
boy
roughly
,
and
when
,
with
a
bewildered
look
,
he
gazedinto
the
face
of
his
visitor
,
Gray
said,—“Can
you
row
me
to
the
stairs
,
by
Burlington
House
in
the
Strand?”“Yes
,
master
,
”
said
the
boy
,
as
he
began
unmooring
the
wherry
.
<EOS>
Gray
seated
himself
in
the
stem
of
the
boat
in
silence
,
and
pulling
hiscravat
over
his
chin
,
he
with
a
smile
muttered,—“Humph
—
<EOS>
Squire
Learmont
,
Jacob
Gray
is
one
too
many
for
you
.
<EOS>
The
day
ofindependence
and
revenge
will
come
for
me
soon
.
<EOS>
”The
boat
shot
out
from
the
shadow
of
the
dark
stairs
,
and
the
boy
beganpulling
easily
towards
Westminster
-
bridge
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
had
the
boat
got
a
dozen
oar
<EOS>
’s
length
from
the
shore
,
whenAlbert
Seyton
stood
upon
the
steps
,
and
cried,—“Boat
—
boat
—
hilloa
,
boat!”“First
oars
!
”
<EOS>
cried
another
voice,—“quick
,
my
man
,
<EOS>
first
oars
here!”Albert
turned
to
the
speaker
,
and
by
his
side
,
on
the
slippery
woodensteps
,
was
the
man
he
had
before
noticed
as
following
Gray
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
they
looked
at
each
other
intensely
,
and
the
officerthought
to
himself—“I
shall
know
you
again
,
my
young
spark
;
”
while
Albert
Seyton
was
quiteabsorbed
in
the
exceedingly
ugly
face
before
him
,
further
adorned
as
itwas
,
for
nature
had
intersected
it
by
several
seams
from
old
woundsreceived
in
many
a
fray
.
<EOS>
“Here
<EOS>
you
are
,
your
honour
,
”
cried
a
waterman
.
<EOS>
“For
me
,
”
said
Albert
.
<EOS>
“I
beg
your
pardon
,
young
fellow
,
<EOS>
it
’s
for
me
,
”
said
the
spy
.
<EOS>
Albert
turned
to
him
,
and
in
a
firm
voice
said—“Sir
,
I
will
not
be
bullied
out
of
my
right
by
you
;
I
called
a
boatfirst
here
,
and
the
first
boat
I
will
have
.
”So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
sprung
into
the
wherry
;
and
not
wishing
the
man
tooverhear
where
he
really
wished
to
go
,
he
merely
said
to
the
waterman,—“Pull
down
the
stream
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
boat
was
pushed
off
,
and
the
spy
called
from
the
stairs
in
an
angryvoice,—“Very
<EOS>
well
,
young
fellow
,
just
wait
till
I
come
across
you
again
<EOS>
;
youmay
jump
better

but
I
’m

d
<EOS>
if
you
’ll
fight
better
than
I.”“Go
home
to
your
anxious
mother
,
”
cried
the
waterman
,
who
,
as
Albertwas
silent
,
considered
he
was
bound
to
take
the
part
of
his
fare
.
<EOS>
“Do
not
answer
him
,
”
said
Albert
.
<EOS>
“He
<EOS>
’s
<EOS>
a
vagabond
,
sir
<EOS>
,
”
said
the
waterman,—“I
knows
him
.
<EOS>
He
’s
a
sort
o’sneak
as
goes
arter
everybody
<EOS>
’s
business
but
his
own
.
<EOS>
”“Do
<EOS>
you
see
a
wherry
just
ahead
?
”
said
Albert
.
<EOS>
“Yes

<EOS>
”“I

<EOS>
You
shall
have
treble

if
you
keep
it
insight
,
and
not
appear
to
press
upon
it

<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
waterman
gave
a
long
whistle
;
and
then
,
with
a
nod
of
his
head
,
hesaid—“All

<EOS>
”“My

”
<EOS>
said
Albert
,
as
he
looked
back
towards
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
There
was
another
wherry
darting
after
them
,
in
the
stern
of
which
satthe
ugly
man

<EOS>
“Pull
away

”
said
the
waterman
,
with
a
laugh
,
as
he
took
long
cleansweeps
with
his
oars,—“a

There

exciting
to
the

of
Albert
Seyton
in
the
turn
things
had
taken
,
as

Who

great
effort

<EOS>
“He

thought
Albert

“
and
I
can
not

with

”While
<EOS>
these
reflections
were
passing
through
Seyton
’s
mind
,
the
boat
inwhich
was
Jacob
Gray
was
shooting
far
ahead
;
and
by
Albert
’s
direction
,
the
waterman
who
rowed
the
wherry
in
which
he
(
Albert
)
sat
,
moved
intoanother
channel
,
so
as
not
to
seem
to
follow
Gray
’s
boat
,
although
heeasily
kept
it
in

<EOS>
“You
<EOS>
quite
understand
me

”
said
Albert
;
“
I
wish
to

My

I
pray

<EOS>
”“I

said
the
waterman
.
<EOS>
“
The
safest
way
in

to

it

”“Rather

Albert

<EOS>
“I

added
the

“

said
Albert

The
boatman
dipped
but
one
oar
languidly
in
the
stream
,
and
allowed
thewherry
to
drift
among
some
barges
when
he
instantly
shipped
his
oars
,
and
doffing
his
coat
and
red
night

he
tendered
them
to
Albert

whowas
soon
attired
in
the
very
cumbrous
garment

went
on
easilyover
all
his

He
then
gathered
up
all
his
long
hair

andconfined
it
under
his
red
night

cap

which
he
pulled
on
nearly
to
hiseyes

<EOS>
The
waterman
sat
for
a
moment
,
apparently
lost
in
intense
surprise
,
atthe
alteration
which
the
two
articles
had
made
in
his
customer’sappearance
,
and
certainly
it
would
have
required
somebody
mostwonderfully
well
acquainted
with
the
young

to
recognise
him
in
hisstrange
disguise
.
<EOS>
A
more
complete
alteration
of
personal
appearancecould
not
possibly
be
conceived
,
and
the
absence
of
the
long
curledhair
gave
his
face
quite
a
different
contour

<EOS>
“Upon
my

said
the

“

”“I

said
Albert
,
“

”The
boat
,
with
the
spy
,
shot
past
at
this
moment
,
and
Albert
was
nowthe
last
in
the
chase
,
to
his
great
aggravation
.
<EOS>
Such
a
state
of
things
,
however
,
did
not
long
continue
,
for
thewaterman
,
after
taking
a
sturdy
look
behind
him
to
mark
the
relativeposition
of
the
boats
,
bent
to
his
oars
with
such
strength
anddetermination
that
the
light
wherry
shot
through
the
water
with
amazingspeed
.
<EOS>
At
each
vigorous
pull
of
the
oars
the
boat
actually
seemed
tojump
forward
several
yards
,
and
the
distance
between
it
and
the
boatpreceding
it
sensibly
decreased
each
moment
.
<EOS>
“I
told
you
I
’d
soon
be
up
with
them
,
sir
,
”
said
the
waterman
,
as
theycame
within
a
dozen
boats
’
lengths
of
the
wherry
in
which
was
SirFrancis
Hartleton
’s
man
.
<EOS>
“
Now
you
’ll
see
me
pass
’em
,
in
proper
style
.
<EOS>
I
won
this
boat
on
the
Thames
,
and
you
shall
see
as
it
ai
n’t
thrownaway
upon
me
.
<EOS>
”The
oars
were
dipped
cleanly
into
the
stream
,
and
rose
with
scarcely
aripple
—
the
speed
of
the
boat
,
for
the
space
of
about
twenty
yards
,
wasprodigious
,
and
Albert
felt
that
he
was
moving
through
the
water
at
amost
exhilarating
rate
.
<EOS>
Now
they
were
alongside
of
the
boat
with
thespy
,
who
immediately
,
to
the
immense
diversion
of
the
waterman
,
cried,—“Hilloa
,
you
there
.
<EOS>
Where
did
you
land
that
young
fellow
you
had?”“Him
with
the
long
hair
?
”
said
the
waterman
.
<EOS>
“Yes!”“And
the
plum
coloured
coat?”“Yes
,
yes
—
you
know
.
<EOS>
”“You
want
to
know
where
I
landed
him?”“Of
course
,
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
asked
you
that
.
<EOS>
”“Then
find
out
,
spooney
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
tell
you
what
,
”
cried
the
spy
.
<EOS>
“
If
I
was
n’t
busy
,
I
’d
have
you
takenbefore
your
betters
.
<EOS>
”“They
are
no
acquaintances
of
yours
,
I
should
say
,
”
replied
thewaterman
.
<EOS>
“Do
<EOS>
you
see
this
?
”
<EOS>
cried
the
infuriated
spy
,
as
he
produced
a
smallstaff
with
a
gilt
-
crown
on
the
top
of
it
.
<EOS>
“
Do
you
see
this
,
fellow?”“Yes!”“Then
mind
what
you
are
at
.
”“Do
<EOS>
you
see
this
?
”
<EOS>
said
the
waterman
,
indicating
with
his
fore
fingerthe
extreme
point
of
his
nose
,
an
action
which
seemed
to
be
especiallyaggravating
to
the
officer
,
who
immediately
said
to
the
boy,—“Pull
alongside
of
him
—
pull
away
.
<EOS>
”“Pull
<EOS>
away
,
”
echoed
Albert
’s
waterman
,
as
with
a
laugh
,
he
bent
himselfto
his
work
,
and
soon
left
the
other
wherry
behind
,
without
a
hope
ofovertaking
him
.
<EOS>
When
the
wherry
was
out
of
ear
-
shot
,
he
turned
to
Albert
and
said,—“You
<EOS>
see
<EOS>
,
sir
,
he
did
n’t
know
you
.
<EOS>
”“No
<EOS>
,
my
disguise
appears
to
be
effectual
.
<EOS>
Get
now
as
near
to
the
otherboat
as
you
like
.
<EOS>
”The
man
nodded
,
and
in
a
few
moments
,
Albert
Seyton
was
so
near
toJacob
Gray
that
he
could
almost
have
sprung
from
one
boat
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
Gray
looked
anxiously
and
suspiciously
at
the
wherry
,
but
as
it
,
to
hiseyes
,
contained
only
two
watermen
,
he
never
for
a
moment
dreamt
of
anydanger
from
it
.
<EOS>
Albert
buried
his
chin
in
the
ample
collar
of
the
coat
,
and
as
his
boatpassed
so
close
to
the
one
Gray
<EOS>
was
in
that
the
watermen
had
both
toship
their
oars
,
he
gazed
with
no
little
emotion
upon
the
pale
sallowface
of
the
man
who
he
would
have
travelled
all
over
the
world
to
meet
,
in
order
to
wring
from
him
the
knowledge
of
where
to
find
hismuch
-
loved
and
cruelly
-
persecuted
Ada
.
<EOS>
Gray
glanced
for
a
moment
at
Albert
,
but
it
was
evident
he
knew
himnot
.
<EOS>
Nothing
was
further
from
Gray
’s
thoughts
than
a
meeting
withAlbert
Seyton
;
and
,
in
fact
,
since
Ada
had
left
him
,
he
scarcelyregarded
Albert
Seyton
as
in
any
way
connected
with
him
or
hisfortunes
,
and
never
for
a
moment
took
the
trouble
to
speculate
uponwhat
<EOS>
he
would
or
could
do
or
say
,
were
they
to
meet
accidentally
.
<EOS>
“Where
are
you
coming
to
now
?
”
<EOS>
cried
Gray
’s
boatman
.
<EOS>
“Nowhere
<EOS>
’s
partiklar
,
”
was
the
reply
of
the
other
;
“
<EOS>
where
are
you?”“What
’s
that
to
you?”“Oh
,
nothink
—
nothink
—
<EOS>
only
I
’d
a
let
you
lay
hold
behind
.
”Gray
<EOS>
’s
waterman
,
with
a
hearty
curse
,
resumed
his
oars
and
gave
up
theparley
.
<EOS>
“Now
,
I
bethink
me
,
”
said
Gray
,
in
a
low
tone
,
“
you
may
put
me
in
atthe
small
stairs
,
by
Buckingham
-

<EOS>
”“Yes

<EOS>
We
are
just

.
<EOS>
”“Good

<EOS>
That

.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
stairs
at
the
end
of
Buckingham

street
led
up
to
a
handsome
gardenthen
,
and
were
themselves
of
an
ancient
and
decayed
appearance
,
beingworn
in
the
centre
quite
into
deep
hollows
,
and
withal
<EOS>
so
rickety
andinjured
by
time
and
rough
usage
,
that
it
required
some
steadiness
toascend
them
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
,
however
,
from
that
very
reason
,
thought
it
asafe
place
of
landing
,
and
when
the
head
of
his
boat
was
moored
to
oneof
the
crumbling
piles
,
that
had
been
rotting
in
the
bed
of
the
riverfor
more
than
fifty
years
,
he
walked
cautiously
along
the
seats
,
andafter
liberally
paying
the
waterman
,
he
commenced
carefully
ascendingthe
slippery
time
-
worn
steps
.
<EOS>
Albert
,
at
this
moment
,
was
in
a
state
of
excitement
impossible
to
bedescribed
.
<EOS>
He
paid
the
waterman
immediately
Gray
<EOS>
’s
wherry
turned
itshead
towards
the
shore
,
and
sat
with
his
hands
upon
the
coat
,
as
readyas
a
harlequin
in
a
pantomime
to
throw
it
off
,
and
assume
his
properappearance
;
but
then
Gray
might
look
round
,
and
he
felt
the
necessityof
waiting
until
he
had
actually
ascended
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
what
an
agonyof
suspense
was
that
brief
period!At
length
Gray
turned
sharp
round
to
his
right
hand
when
he
got
to
thetop
of
the
steps
,
and
with
the
speed
of
lightning
Albert
Seyton
threwoff
the
coat
and
night
-
cap
,
and
sprung
after
him
to
the
intenseastonishment
of
Gray
’s
waterman
,
who
stood
with
his
mouth
wide
open
,
and
his
eyes
staring
out
of
his
head
like
those
of
a
boiled
fish
,
fornearly
two
minutes
before
he
could
ejaculate,—“Well
,
I
never
—
there
’s
ago
—
in
all
my
blessed
born
days
I
never

<EOS>
Who
thedevil
<EOS>

<EOS>
that?”“Ah

”
said
Albert
’s
waterman
,
as
he
deliberately
puton
the
coat
.
<EOS>
“What
do
you
mean?”“I’ve
been
giving
the
devil
a
coat

<EOS>
Did
n’t
you
see
how
quick
we
went?”“Yes

<EOS>
”“Well

as

”The
<EOS>
spy
had
scrambled
from
the
boat
on
to
the
wooden
steps
,
but
he
wasso
annoyed
at
this
last
remark
,
that
snatching
his
staff
from
hispocket
,
he
turned
round
,
<EOS>
saying,—“If

<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
waterman
was
,
however
,
a
great
deal
too
quick
for
him
;
for
,
as
hetried
to
step
from
the
stairs
into
the
boat
,
by
one
sweep
of
his
oarshe
<EOS>
shot
the
wherry
out
some
three
or
four
yards
from
the
landing
,
andthe
spy
stepped
up
to
his
knees
in
the
river
,
and
was
nearlyprecipitated
head
foremost
into
the
stream
.
<EOS>
“Don’t
pison
the
water
,
”
said
the
waterman
;
and
then
he
pulled
steadilyaway
.
<EOS>
“I’ll
have
you
another
time
,
my
man
,
”
said
the
spy
,
quite
livid
withrage
,
as
he
turned
,
and
again
ascended
the
steps
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
Jacob
Gray
had
gathered
his
cloak
closely
around
him
,
and
smiling
to
himself
at
his
own
cleverness
in
,
as
he
thought
,
thoroughly
outwitting
Learmont
,
and
even
when
there
was
no
danger
,
approaching
his
home
in
so
very
baffling
a
manner
,
was
creeping
alongclose
to
the
houses
as
usual
towards
his
obscure
lodgings
.
<EOS>
Albert
Seyton
,
when
he
reached
the
top
of
the
stairs
,
looked
anxiouslyto
the
right
,
and
there
he
saw
Gray
,
not
half
a
dozen
yards
from
him
.
<EOS>
To
follow
so
closely
would
have
been
very
dangerous
,
undisguised
now
asthe
young
man
was
,
and
he
hung
back
,
still
keeping
Jacob
Gray
in
hiseye
,
until
the
latter
had
proceeded
nearly
to
a
turning
which
led
intothe
next
street
but
one
in
which
he
lived
.
<EOS>
The
moment
,
then
,
that
hewas
upon
the
corner
Albert
walked
hastily
forward
,
and
by
pursuing
thesame
system
at
the
corner
of
the
next
street
,
he
fairly
succeeded
indogging
Gray
to
the
little
mean
shop
above
which
he
lodged
.
<EOS>
Albert
’s
heart
beat
high
as
he
saw
him
enter
the
humble
abode
.
<EOS>
Hisagitation
became
extreme
,
and
the
thought
that
he
was
so
near
Adacaused
such
a
tumult
of
delightful
feelings
in

,
that
heforgot
all

actually
boundedforward
half
a
dozen
paces
towards
the
shop
,
before
his
promise
toLearmont
came
across
his
mind
,
and
arrested
his
eager
footsteps

“Oh

he
said
,
“

”Albert
now
crossed
over
to
the
other
side
of
the

and
diving
into
adoorway
where
he
was
completely
hidden
,
but
from
whence
he
couldcommand
a
good
view
of
the
house
in
which
he
so
erroneously
supposedAda
to
be
,
he
gave
himself
up
to
the
delirious
feeling
that
he
had
atlength
arrived
at
the
end
of
all
his
troubles
,
and
Ada
would
soon
behis
,
while
the
patronage
of
the
rich
Squire
Learmont
would
ensure
himease

perhaps
in
time
fortune

<EOS>
There
was
no
sign
of
inhabitants

but
in
a
few
more
moments
,
as
Albert
rose
his
eye
restlesslyfrom
window
to
window
,
he
saw
a
dirty
narrow
curtain
moved
in
one
ofthe
top
rooms
,
and
fancy
made
him
think
the
hand
was
Ada

hesaw
but
partially
.
<EOS>
“My

cried

“

besure

was
interrupted
at
this
moment
by
some
one
popping
into
the
darkdoorway
so
suddenly
as
to
run
against
him
with
great
violence

<EOS>
Albert
immediately
laid

cried—“Hilloa

Softly

”“What

you?”“Yes

I
can

I
will
too

”“Then

said
Albert
,
“
I
’ll
knock
you
down
first

and
suiting
theaction
to
the
word
<EOS>
,
he
grappled
with
the
officer
before
he
was
aware
,
and
although
much
the
lighter
and
weaker
of
the
two
,
threw
him
upon
hisback
in
the
passage
with
so
much
violence
,
that
he
lay
stunned
.
<EOS>
“I
am
sorry
for
this

thought
Albert
;
“
<EOS>

I
can
allow
no

Farewell

now
away

”Casting
<EOS>
then
,
ever
and
anon
,
lingering
looks
behind
at
the
house
,
whichhe
believed
contained
the
object
of
his
fond
affections
,
Albert
leftthe
street
;
and
when
he
had
turned
the
corner
,
and
could
no
longer
seeeven
the
habitation
of
Jacob
Gray
,
he
started
off
at
a
pace
<EOS>
whichastonished
every
one
he
passed
,
towards
the
house
of
Learmont
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
,
when
he
reached
his
room
,
sat
down
on
the
side
of
themiserable
little
bed
,
and
began
to
think
of
his
future
plans
and
hopes
,
with
a
feeling
of
certainty
,
as
regarded
their
stability
,
such
as
hehad
rarely
before
experienced
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
if
Providence
having
nowhurried
him
on
to
the
very
brink
of
destruction
,
was
determined
thathis
fall
should
be
the
more
dreadful
and
full
of
suffering
by
hishaving
no
sort
of
anticipation
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
was
as
one
smiling
and
makinglong
calculations
on
the
brink
of
the
grave
.
<EOS>
“Learmont
,
”
he
said
,
“
has
seized
the
bait
—
I
shall
be
wealthy
and
free
,
besides
satisfying
my
revenge
.
<EOS>
They
taunt
me
with
being
subtle
—
I
trustthat
they
will
find
me
so
.
<EOS>
They
might
long
ago
have
temporised
with
me
,
and
ensured
their
own
safety
by
never
awakening
in
my
breast
the
darkfeelings
towards
them
that
now
possess
it
;
but
they
sought
my
life
,
andI
swore
revenge
.
<EOS>
Britton
and
Learmont
shall
fall
in
one
commondestruction
,
while
Ada
shall
have
more
trouble
to
prove
her

should
she
linger

<EOS>
Yes
,
I
shall
be
revenged
on
her
,
as
well
as
upon
Britton
andLearmont
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
sat
then
for
some
moments
in
deep
thought
,
and
a
feeling
of
anxietybegan
to
creep
over
him
.
<EOS>
“I
am
getting
nervous
now
,
”
he
muttered
;
“
of
late
I
am
fearfullysubject
to
such
gloomy
thoughts
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
glad
when
this

lonely

<EOS>
It
suits
not

<EOS>
I
—
<EOS>
I
did
not

much

she
was
with

but
now
that
I
am
quite
alone

ashuddering
awe
creeps
around
my

I
start
at

<EOS>
Gracious
Heaven
—
how
my
heart
beats
now
!
’
<EOS>
Tis
time
I
should
haveease
and
comfort
in
some
other
land
,
where
all
things
are
new
andstrange
,
and
there
is
nothing
to
remind
me
of
the
past
—
aye
,
then
,
Ishall

<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
rose
,
and
paced
his
room
uneasily
;
but
even
in
his
mental
agitationhe
trod
cautiously
,
as
if
the
very
boards
would
proclaim
,
to
theworld
—
there
trod
Jacob
Gray
,
the
murderer
!
<EOS>
Then
he
produced
hisconfession
,
and
a
strange
desire
seized
him
to
read
it
carefullythrough
,
and
make
some
verbal
corrections
in
it
,
in
order
that
itshould
be
still
more
clear
and
explanatory
than
it
had
been
.
<EOS>
Again
,
andagain
,
he
read
over
the
document
,
and
was
satisfied
that
its
notationswere
distinct
and
clear
.
<EOS>
“Yes
<EOS>
—
yes
—
if
anything
should
happen
to
me
,
”
he
muttered
,
“
this
willdestroy
Learmont
and
Britton

likewise
doom

poverty

revert

the
crown
,
or
some
very
distantbranch

will
be
eager
to
acquire

<EOS>
So
even
Ishould
not
fall
quite
unavenged

<EOS>
In
my

I
should
be
terrible

<EOS>
Death?—Death
?
<EOS>

such

enter
mybrain

hundreds
of

<EOS>
I
suppose
that

what
I
must
call

strange

oppresses
me

<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
was
now
silent
for
some
time
,
and
then
,
hastily
rising
,
he
held
theconfession
in
his
hand
and
glanced
around
his
room
,
as
he
said,—“I
will
never
again
carry
so
important
a
document
as
this
about
withme
.

<EOS>
Tis
far
better
—

safer
in
some
hiding

place
here
;

thensuppose

after

That

—
death
—
death

pshaw

<EOS>
what
have
I
to
do
with
death

for
many
yearsto

,
nevertheless
,
trembled
,
as
he
strove
to
reason
himself
out
of
hisnervous
fears
,
and
he
was
some
time
before
he
could
decide
upon
whereto
put
his
confession
,
so
that
it
must
eventually
be
found
,
but
stillwhere
a
search
would
be
required
to
bring
it
to
light
.
<EOS>
He
finallyripped
some
of
the
lining
from
his
cloak
,
and
inserted
the
confessionbetween
that
and
the
cloth
.
<EOS>
“There
it
will
be
quite
safe
from
any
casual
observation
,
”
he
said,“while
sooner
or
later
it
must
come
to
light
,
and
my
vengeance
would
begreater
by
a
little
delay
,
because
Learmont
would
be
lulled
intofancied
security
if
no
immediate
danger
assailed
after
my
death
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
sunk
upon
his
chair
muttering
.
<EOS>
“Death
again
<EOS>
—
death
again
—
death
again

—
how
that

all

”He
<EOS>
hung
the
cloak
on
a
large
hook
behind
the
door
of
his
room
,
and
thensaid,—“How
many
persons
would
search
this
room
,
and
toss
this
cloak
about
,
without
discovering
that
it
contained
anything
so
important

nowhidden
in

”He
<EOS>
then
proceeded
to
a
cupboard

taking
from

a

bottle

hedrank
a
quantity
of
raw

habituatedhimself

reason
himself
out

<EOS>
“Drink

he
muttered
,
as
he
returned
the

bottle
to

.
<EOS>
“
That

I
am
very

”He
<EOS>
threw
himself
upon
his
bed
,
and
exhausted
as
he
was
by
the
fewpreceding
day
’s
actions
,
he
soon
dropped
into
slumber
—
not
an
unbrokenor
easy

,
for
the
imagination

now
freed
from

conjured

Drink
at

Chequers.—The
Summons
to
Britton.—His
Majesty’sAmusements

<EOS>
Britton
’s
rage
at
the
escape
of
Gray
from
his
room
,
where
he
thought
hehad
him
so
securely
,
almost
made
him
sober
for
the
next
four
-
and
-
twentyhours
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
too
great
a
passion
to
drink
,
and
it
was
not
until
hisfriend
the
butcher
had
generously
drunk
both
Britton
’s
share
and
hisown
of
sundry
strong
compounds
,
<EOS>
that
the
smith
,
dashing
his
clenchedfirst
upon
the
table
with
a
blow
that
made
every
article
upon
it
jumpagain
,
exclaimed,—“Brandy
—
brandy
here
.
<EOS>
Quick
with
you
.
<EOS>
”“Your
<EOS>
majesty
shall
have
it
in
a
moment
,
”
cried
the
landlord
;
“
may
Ipresume
to
ask
if
your
majesty
will
have
it
raw
or
mixed?”“Neither
,
”
roared
Britton
.
<EOS>
“Neither
?
<EOS>
Oh
dear
me
.
<EOS>
Certainly
—
perhaps
your
majesty
means
a
little
ofboth?”“No
<EOS>
,
I
do
n’t
,
fool
!
<EOS>
Bring
me
a
pint
of
brandy
boiling
.
<EOS>
”“B
<EOS>
—

—
b
—
boiling?”“Yes
.
”“Without
<EOS>
any
water?”“What
do
I
want
with
water
.
<EOS>
For
the
future
I
’ll
drink
nothing
butboiling
brandy
.
”“Smash
<EOS>
me
,
”
remarked
Bond
,
the
butcher
,
“
if
that
ai
n’t
a
good
idea
.
<EOS>
”“Off
with
you
<EOS>
,
”
roared
Britton
,
to
the
amazed
landlord
.
<EOS>
“
Mind
you
bringit
in
with
the
bubbles
on
it
.
<EOS>
Let
me
see
the
hot
steam
rising
fromit
—
like
—
like
reeking
blood
,
and
be
d
<EOS>
—
d
to
you
—
take
that
.
”As
<EOS>
these
remarks
were
accompanied
by
a
pint
measure
,
which
passedwithin
an
inch
of
his
head
,
the
landlord
made
a
wild
kind
of
rush
fromthe
room
shouting,—“Brandy
boiling
—
brandy
boiling
directly
,
for
his
majesty
King
Britton
.
<EOS>
”Britton
felt
himself
wonderfully
better
and
much
appeased
in
spiritafter
his
order
of
the
boiling
brandy
,
and
he
turned
to
the
butcherwith
something
of
his
usual
manner
,
saying,—“Bond
,
<EOS>
my
boy
,
I
shall
never
be
the
man
I
was
till
I
have
taken
thatfellow

Bond
.
<EOS>
“Yes

I
do

<EOS>
”“Oh
<EOS>
,
be
bothered
;
you
’ll
be
able
to
drink
as
much
as
ever
,
I
know

<EOS>
”“Yes
<EOS>
as
to
that
—
but,—”“Well

what
more
do
you
wish

<EOS>
Do
n’t
be
unreasonable

joint
me
with

I
calls
that

”“It

’s
<EOS>
something

said
Britton
.
<EOS>
“Something
?
<EOS>
I
believe
you
it
is

<EOS>
Why

<EOS>
”“So

you
will

but
you
must
wait
your

Now
I
tell
you

MasterBritton

you

and
here
you

been
a

Just

and
then
we
can
cut

<EOS>
”“I
was
a
fool
to
leave
him
a
moment
,
”
said
Britton
;
“
I
ought
to

The

”“Some

“

”The
<EOS>
landlord
at
this
moment
made
his
appearance
,
with
the
boilingbrandy
in
a
punch
-
bowl
.
<EOS>
At
least
,
the
landlord
was
supposed
to
followit
into
the
room
;
for
the
steam
that
arose
from
the
liquor
hid
his
facein
a
kind
of
glory
,
such
as
sometimes
may
be
seen
in
an
old
pictureconfounding
the
physiognomy
of
a
saint
.
<EOS>
He
said
nothing
,
but
laid
the
streaming
beverage
before
Britton
,
andthen
he
coughed
,
and
winked
,
and
wiped
his
eyes
,
and
sneezed
,
all
ofwhich
symptoms
of
uneasiness
arose
from
the
subtle
particles
of
theevaporating
spirit
having
nearly
suffocated
him
.
<EOS>
“What
<EOS>
do
you
mean
by
all
that
?
”
said
Britton
.
<EOS>
“Ah
<EOS>
,
what
do
you
mean

”
<EOS>
roared
Bond
,
giving
the
landlord
a
smack
on
theback
that
nearly
felled
him
.
<EOS>
“The

the
steam

Chequers

”“Oh

then
you

have

<EOS>
”“Really

to

such
an
expression
in

the

is
—
I

rather
not

”“But

”“Spare

”“Hold
<EOS>
him
,
Bond
,
while
I
pour
it
down
his

”
cried
Britton
.
<EOS>
The
landlord
groaned—“If
<EOS>
I
must
take
a
small
sip
,
why
I
would
rathertake
it
myself
.
<EOS>
”“Toss
<EOS>
it
off

,
at

and
do
n’t
be
making
those
faces
.
<EOS>
Come
,
now
,
off
with
it
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
landlord
was
perfectly
well
aware
that
no
mortal
throat
could
withimpunity
swallow
the
scalding
liquor
to
trickle
down
it
;
and
,
in
fact
,
he
had
been
pleasing
himself
with
the
idea
of
how
scalded
the
smithwould
be
if
,
with
his
usual
precipitancy
,
he
should
take
a
gulp
of
theliquor
;
but
now
that
it
came
to
his
turn
first
,
the
joke
altered
itscomplexion
altogether
,
and
his
hand
trembled
as
he
held
the
ladle
tohis
mouth
.
<EOS>
“Quick
,
”
roared
Britton
;
and
the
unfortunate
landlord
took
a
small
sip
,
which
went
down
his
throat
like
a
small
globule
of
melted
lead
,
andinduced
him
to
make
such
wry
faces
and
contortions
as
quite
delightedAndrew
Britton
,
who
,
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
moment
,
actually
forgotJacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
How
long
the
landlord
<EOS>
’s
sufferings
might
have
been
protracted
it
ishard
to
say
;
but
fortunately
for
him
,
in
the
midst
of
Britton
’s
highenjoyment
of
the
scene
,
a
boy
came
into
the
room
,
and
screamed
out
,
without
the
least
reverence
for
the
kingly
dignity
that
the
smith
hadassumed
at
the
Chequers,—“Is
Andrew
Britton
here?”“Halloo
,
you
villain
,
”
cried
Britton
,
“
what
do
you
mean?”“I
wants
Andrew
Britton
,
”
cried
the
boy
.
<EOS>
“You
<EOS>
scoundrel!”“You’re
<EOS>
another!”Britton
<EOS>
’s
<EOS>
face
assumed
a
purplish
hue
with
rage
,
but
he
was
silent
,
<EOS>
andthen
beckoning
to
the
boy
,
he
whispered
to
<EOS>
Bond,—“I’ll
scald
him
from
top
to
toe
.
<EOS>
”“Don’t
<EOS>
you
wish
you
may
catch

cried
the

,
“

<EOS>
”“Oh

cried
the
landlord
,
“
how

you
behave
so
?
<EOS>
What
doyou

<EOS>
I

’ll

<EOS>
”Britton
<EOS>
slowly
rose
from
his
seat
and
began
sidling
round
the
tabletowards
the
boy
;
who
,
however
,
was
far
too
quick
and
agile
for
thebulky
smith
,
and
throwing
a
folded
piece
of
paper
upon
the
floor
,
hedarted
to
the
door
<EOS>
,
crying—“Don’t
you
wish

you
’ll
make

so
.
<EOS>
Good

<EOS>
”“Hold
<EOS>
him
,
”
cried
Britton
to
the
landlord
,
who
made
a
futile
,
and
notvery
energetic
,
attempt
to
detain
the
boy
,
who
was
out
of
the
house
ina
moment
,
and
in
the
next
a
stone
came
through
a
pane
of
glass
and
hitthe
landlord
upon
the
side
of
the
head
.
<EOS>
“Oh
,
the
vagabond
,
”
said
mine
host
,
making
a
rush
to
the
door
,
andfully
participating
in
Britton
’s
indignation
now
that
he
had
himselfcause
of
complaint
;
but
Britton
intercepted
him
,
and
being
resolved
tohave
revenge
upon
somebody
<EOS>
,
he
knocked
the
landlord
’s
head
against
thedoor
-
post
,
with
a
rap
that
made
him
look
confused
for
a
moment
,
andthen
retire
from
the
room
dancing
with
pain
.
<EOS>
“All
<EOS>
right
,
”
cried
Bond
.
<EOS>
“Aham
!
”
said
Britton
,
returning
to
his
seat
.
<EOS>
“
That
’ll
teach
him
to
runagainst
me
another
time
,
and
if
I
meet
that
boy
,
I
’ll
wring
his
neck
.
<EOS>
”“What
<EOS>
’s
this
here
?
”
remarked
the
butcher
,
as
he
picked
up
the
note
thelad
had
thrown
down
.
“
<EOS>
‘

Britten

The

<EOS>
”“What

”“Meat

Nonsense

<EOS>
What

<EOS>
Give

<EOS>
”Britton
<EOS>
snatched
the
note
from
the
hands
of
the
butcher
,
and
read
asfollows:—“Meet

Am

cried
Bond

<EOS>
“
Does

,
eh
,
Britton?”“What
’s
that
to
you?”“Nothing

<EOS>
”“You

<EOS>
”Britton
liked
Bond
principally
because
when
he
roared
at
him
,
he
wasreplied
to
much
in
the
same
strain
,
and
,
if
possible
,
an
octave
-
higher
,
so
he
betrayed
no
indignation
at
the
independence
of
the
butcher
,
buttaking
up
a
ladle
full
of
the
brandy
,
which
had
now
much
cooled
,
hepoured
it
down
his
throat
,
and
then
,
followed
it
by
another
,
afterwhich
he
flung
the
ladle
at
the
head
of
a
quiet
-
looking
man
who
wassmoking
a
pipe
and
drinking
a
pint
of
small
ale
in
a
corner
,
andrising
<EOS>
,
he
cried—“I’ll
<EOS>
go
out
now

<EOS>
order

be

Halloo

<EOS>
”“But
<EOS>
you
need
n’t
have
thrown
away
the
ladle

”
remarked
Bond
,
as
he
took
the
bowl
in
his
hand
and
finished
the
contents
at
onedraught
,
hot
and
strong
as
they
were
.
<EOS>
The
landlords
voice
was
now
heard
shouting—“His

<EOS>
His

he
added
to
himself

”CHAPTER

XCV.The
Walk
in
Search
of
Albert.—The
Recognition
at
Charing
Cross
.
<EOS>
Was
Ada
happy
in
her
pleasant
home
at
Sir
Francis
Hartleton’s
—
was
thereno
cloud
yet
upon
her
young
heart
?
<EOS>
Alas
,
how
purely
comparative
are
allour
joys
and
all
our
sorrows
.
<EOS>
The
change
from
her
weary
confinementwith
Jacob
Grey
,
and
the
dismal
habitations
<EOS>
it
was
his
policy
to
livein
,
to
the
kind
looks
—
kinder
words
and
happy
home
of
the
warm
-
heartedmagistrate
<EOS>
,
was
like
suddenly
,
to
some
adventurous
voyager
to
the
farnorth
,
breaking
the
misty
horrors
around
him
,
and
at
a
moment
when
hefelt
almost
inclined
to
lie
down
and
die
before
the
rigour
of
theseason
,
and
transporting
him
to
some
fair
region
,
where
the
bright
sunshone
upon
the
trailing
vine
—
where
the
orange
groves
were
musical
withthe
songs
of
birds
,
and
the
very
air
as
it
gently
fanned
his
cheeks
wasin
itself
a
delicious
luxury
.
<EOS>
To
Ada
,
for
the
first
few
days
,
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
stepped
into
anew
existence
;
but
when
the
novelty
of
the
change
was
over
—
when
,
shehad
done
assuring
herself
that
she
was
free
for
ever
from
Jacob
Gray
,
how
her
heart
began
to
yearn
for
him
she
loved
!
<EOS>
What
an
instablecuriosity
arose
in
her
mind
,
to
know
who
and
what
she
was
—
what
name
sheshould
associate
with
the
endearing
one
of
father
,
and
whether
sheshould
weep
over
another
grave
,
or
ever
feel
the
fond
embrace
of
aliving
parent
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
strangely
unnatural
if
these
active
sources
ofanxiety
had
not
sprung
up
rapidly
in
such
a
heart
as
Ada
’s
,
alive
as
itwas
to
every
noble
feeling
—
every
tender
sympathy
.
<EOS>
The
companionship
of
the
young
persons
of
her
own
sex
,
whom
LadyHartleton
often
collected
about
her
,
tended
probably
to
foster
andencourage
these
feelings
in
Ada
,
and
the
ready
tears
—
tears
which
shehad
never
shed
when
in
misfortune
,
and
exposed
to
all
the
harshness
ofJacob
Gray
,
would
start
to
her
eyes
at
the
mention
of
a
father
’s
or
amother
’s
love
by
any
of
the
fair
young
beings
who
delighted
in
hercompany
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
had
promised
her
he
would
have
Albert
Seytonsought
for
,
and
he
had
kept
his
word
;
but
what
degree
of
exertion
onthe
part
of
another
will
satisfy
the
heart
that
loves
,
and
Ada
longedto
search
herself
for
him
,
who
had
cheered
her
under
unhappierauspices
,
and
loved
her
in
her
gloom
and
misery
.
<EOS>
Into
the
friendly
bosom
of
Lady
Hartleton
,
she
poured
her
griefs
andanxieties
,
and
if
she
found
no
relief
of
a
tangible
nature
,
she
thereat
least
found
ready
sympathy
,
and
Lady
Hartleton
would
say
to
her,—“My
dear
Ada
,
I
can
do
not
more
at
present
than
weep
with
you
,
if
youmust
weep
,
and
comfort
you
,
if
you
will
be
afflicted
.
<EOS>
Be
assured
,
SirFrancis
is
doing
his
utmost
to
discover
Albert
Seyton
<EOS>
’s
place
of
abode
,
as
well
as
toiling
hard
to
unravel
the
mystery
connected
with
you
.
<EOS>
”Ada
<EOS>
would
then
,
in
tears
,
exclaim
against
her
own
ingratitude
,
andaccuse
herself
of
selfishness
,
and
Lady
Hartleton
frequently
had
thegreatest
difficulty
to
remind
her
that
she
considered
her
feelingnatural
,
and
in
every
way
worthy
of
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
early
in
the
day
preceding
that
on
which
the
magistrate
haddiscovered
poor
Maud
,
that
Ada
with
a
trembling
voice
,
said
to
LadyHartleton,—“I
have
a
great
favour
—
to
—
ask
.
<EOS>
”“No
,
my
dear
Ada
,
”
said
Lady
Hartleton
,
kissing
her
cheek
,
“
you

<EOS>
”“Ah

,
it
is
your
kind
heart
which
prompts
your
tongue

”
said
Ada
,
“

your

I

I

”“Say

perhaps
a

sometimes

what

fail

the

”Lady
<EOS>
Hartleton
shook
her
head
,
<EOS>
as
she
said,—“Ada

you
would

a

can
hired
zeal
ever
reach
the
height
of
exertion
attained
bythat
<EOS>
which
springs
alone
from
the
true
heart?”“I
grant
you
that
it
seldom
can

but
then
,
Ada
,
there
are
many
caseswhere
<EOS>
mere
knowledge
and
skill
will
do
much
more
than
the

”“There

may
be

Ada

<EOS>
”“It

with

”“No

and
my
heart

oftenerchecked
with
a
blow
,
than
encouraged
by

<EOS>
”“We
will
go
as
soon
as
I
can
consult
Sir
Francis
about
who
shallaccompany
us
,
”
said
Lady
Hartleton
.
<EOS>
Ada
could
only
look
her
thanks
,
and
Lady
Hartleton
left
the
room
insearch
of
her
husband
,
who
gave
a
more
ready
consent
to
the
scheme
thanshe
<EOS>
imagined
he
would
,
only
that
he
said
he
would
send
with
them
twoofficers
on
whom
he
could
thoroughly
and
entirely
depend
.
<EOS>
“You
will
then
be
as
safe
,
”
he
said
,
“
as
if
you
were
in
your
owndrawing
-
room
,
and
if
it
will
satisfy
the
mind
of
Ada
,
I
advise
you
togo
at
once
.
<EOS>
”With
<EOS>
this
Lady
Hartleton
returned
to
Ada
,
and
in
ten
minutes
they
wereequipped
for
their
walk
,
the
two
officers
being
strictly
ordered
by
SirFrancis
never
to
lose
sight
of
them
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
“I
can
adopt
but
one
plan
of
operation
,
”
said
Ada
,
“
and
that
is
to
gofrom
place
to
place
where
Albert
has
lived
,
and
at
each
make
whatinquiries
may
suggest
themselves
on
the
moment
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
can
find
myway
,
if
put
in
the
neighbourhood
,
to
the
first
lodging
<EOS>
Jacob
Graybrought
me
to
in
London
;
at
least
,
the
first
I
have
any
recollectionof
.
<EOS>
It
stood
,
as
I
have
often
wearied
you
with
telling
,
in
abye
-
street
,
at
the
back
of
another
,
the
name
of
a
which
<EOS>
well
recollectwas
Swallow
-
street
.
<EOS>
”“That
<EOS>
we
shall
have
no
difficulty
in
finding
,
”
said
Lady
Hartleton
.
<EOS>
“Swallow
-
street
is
a
well
-
known
thoroughfare
;
although
,
I
believe
,
noneof
the
most
select
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
can
act
as
your
guide
there
;
but
should
Ibe
at
fault
,
those
who
are
following
us
,
as
our
guards
<EOS>
,
can
no
doubtset
us
right
.
<EOS>
”Many
were
the
glances
of
admiration
cast
upon
Ada
,
as
she
and
LadyHartleton
walked
along
Whitehall
to
Charing
-
cross
,
and
by
the
time
theyreached
the
corner
of
the
Strand
,
several
idle
loungers
had
enlistedthemselves
in
their
train
,
with
a
determination
to
see
where
they
couldpossibly
be
going
.
<EOS>
“We
must
cross
here
,
”
said
Lady
Hartleton
,
“
and
pass
those
mean
rows
ofbuildings
,
which
are
called
the
Royal
Mews
,
and
then
we
shall
,
if
Imistake
not
,
be
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
street
youmention
.
<EOS>
”As
<EOS>
Lady
Hartleton
spoke
,
she
felt
Ada
clutch
her
arm
very
tightly
,
andturning
to
see
what
occasioned
it
<EOS>
,
she
saw
one
of
the
puppies
of
theday
with
his
grinning
face
,
within
a
few
inches
of
Ada
’s
ear
,
mutteringsome
of
the
ineffable
nonsense
common
to
such
animals
,
when
they
pitchupon
an
apparently
unprotected
female
as
the
object
of
their
insultingaddress
.
<EOS>
A
flash
of
indignation
came
from
the
eyes
of
Lady
Hartleton
;
but
beforeshe
could
speak
,
she
saw
the
fopling
flung
into
the
roadway
,
with
aviolence
that
sent
him
half
across
it
;
and
Sir
Francis
Hartletonhimself
,
who
had
followed
after
the
officers
,
took
Ada
’s
arm
withinhis
,
saying,—“There
now
.
<EOS>
If
you
had
been
quite
alone
,
Ada
,
you
would
have
beenpestered
,
probably
,
for
an
hour
,
by
that
ape
in
man
’s
clothes
.
<EOS>
”Ada
turned
to
speak
to
the
magistrate
,
when
a
cry
of
pleasure
escapedher
.
<EOS>
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
was
Albert
Seyton
,
walking
leisurelytowards
the
Horse
-
guards
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
was
just
in
time
to
stop
her
from
rushing
acrossthe
roadway
,
and
detaining
her
by
the
arm
,
said,—“Ada
,
do
me
one
favour
!
<EOS>
Go
home
at
once
,
and
trust
to
my
word
of
honourthat
I
will
not
lose
sight
of
him
for
one
moment
.
<EOS>
The
public
street
isno
place
for
you
and
him
to
meet
in
.
<EOS>
For
Heaven
’s
sake
,
now
go
home!”“I
—
<EOS>
I
will
—
if
you
wish
it
,
”
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“
Oh
!
<EOS>
He
is
found
—
he
is
found!”“Take
<EOS>
her
home
through
the
park
,
by
Spring

gardens
<EOS>
,
”
whispered
SirFrancis
to
his
wife
.
<EOS>
“
I
wish
to
have
some
conversation
with
this
youngman
,
before
Ada
,
with
her
generous
feelings
,
commits
herself
too
far
.
<EOS>
Iwill
be
home
within
the
hour
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
magistrate
then
darted
across
the
road
,
and
followed
Albert
<EOS>
Seytonclosely
,
as
his
first
object
was
to
see
where
he
lived
,
provided
he
wasgoing
home
,
as
he
,
Sir
Francis
,
was
not
quite
satisfied
with
Albert’slong
absence

CHAPTER
XCVI.Sir
Francis
Hartleton
’s
Surprise
at
Albert
<EOS>
’s
Place
of
Destination.—TheWatch
on
the
Squires
’
House.—Ada
<EOS>
’s
Disappointment
.
<EOS>
When
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
darted
across
the
road
in
order
to
followAlbert
Seyton
,
his
views
,
with
regard
to
the
young
man
,
were
to
tracehim
to
his
house
,
and
then
immediately
after
send
for
him
to
his
,
SirFrancis
’s
office
,
by
Buckingham
-
house
;
and
,
in
a
conversation
with
him
,
endeavour
to
come
to
a
more
decided
opinion
than
he
was
at
present
ableto
<EOS>
arrive
at
with
respect
to
the
stability
of
his
affection
for
Ada;for
<EOS>
it
is
not
saying
too
much
,
when
we
assert
that
the
interest
felt
bythe
magistrate
in
the
welfare
and
future
happiness
of
the
beautifulgirl
,
who
was
,
by
<EOS>
so
singular
a
train
of
circumstances
,
placed
in
hiscare
,
was
equal
to
that
of
a
fond
father
for
a
darling
child
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
The
very
romantic
circumstances
connected
with
her
would
have
investedAda
with
a
great
interest
,
even
had
she
been
other
than
what
she
was;but
<EOS>
when
in
herself
,
she
concentrated
all
the
sweet
feminine
charms
ofmind
and
person
which
the
warmest
fancy
could
suggest
,
she
became
,
indeed
,
an
object
of
deep
interest
to
Sir
Francis
—
an
interest
whichamounted
to
a
pure
and
holy
affection
.
<EOS>
Her
gentleness
,
and
yet
her
rare
courage
—
her
simplicity
,
and
yet
heractive
intellect
—
her
clinging
affection
and
gushing
gratitude
to
thosewho
were
kindly
disposed
towards
her
,
and
her
utter
want
ofselfishness
,
<EOS>
all
combined
to
make
her
such
a
character
as
one
mightdream
of
,
but
seldom
hope
to
see
realised
.
<EOS>
“Her
future
happiness
,
”
thought
Sir
Francis
,
“
all
depends
upon
thisyoung
man
whom
I
am
now
following
,
and
I
think
I
have
a
right
to
bemore
careful
that
Ada
,
with
all
her
fine
noble
feelings
,
is
notsacrificed
to
one
who
may
fail
to
appreciate
the
rich
treasure
he
maypossess
.
<EOS>
I
will
,
ere
I
welcome
this
Albert
Seyton
to
my
house
,
be
wellassured
that
he
is
deserving
of
the
pure
young
heart
that
I
amconvinced
is
all
his
own
.
<EOS>
One
pang
is
far
better
for
Ada
to
endure
thanthe
years
of
misery
that
must
ensue
from
an
ill
-
assorted
union
.
<EOS>
”Reasoning
<EOS>
thus
the
magistrate
followed
Albert
Seyton
sufficiently
closeto
<EOS>
be
certain
he
could
enter
no
house
without
his
observation
;
and
yetat
the
same
time
,
at
such
a
distance
as
to
run
no
great
risk
ofrecognition
should
the
young
man
turn
round
.
<EOS>
Little
did
poor
Albert
,
whose
mind
was
,
at
the
present
moment
,
<EOS>
so
fullof
recollections
of
his
Ada
,
that
he
scarcely
knew
whither
hisfootsteps
led
him
,
imagine
that
he
had
not
only
passed
her
withintwenty
paces
,
but
was
now
actually
kept
from
her
because
there
was
adoubt
of
the
sincerity
of
that
passion
which
was
at
once
the
bliss
andthe
bane
of
his
existence
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
could
not
hear
the
deep
sighs
that
burst
from
the
labouringheart
of
the
young
man
,
as
he
whispered
to
himself—“My
Ada
—
my
beautiful
and
true
!
<EOS>
Oh
?
<EOS>
When
will
kind
Heaven
bless
my
eyes
,
by
permitting
me
to
gaze
upon
thy
face
again
?
<EOS>
The
summer
’s
sun
mayshine
bright’y
for
others
,
and
the
green
earth
look
beautiful
,
butthere
is
a
cloud
upon
my
spirits
,
and
all
is
dreary
,
bleak
,
anddesolate
to
me
without
you
,
my
beautiful
Ada!”Alas
!
<EOS>
Poor
Albert
—
if
already
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
from
your
longabsence
from
his
office
,
entertains
lingering
unwelcome
doubt
of
yourfeelings
for
Ada
—
what
harsh
suspicions
are
you
not
about
to
subjectyourself
to
within
the
next
quarter
of
an
hour
.
<EOS>
How
near
are
you
to
thecompletion
of
your
fondest
hopes
,
and
yet
how
distant
—
long
sought
foras
you
have
been
,
you
are
now
found
but
to
be
avoided
.
<EOS>
The
young
dejected
lover
passed
onwards
in
his
sorrow
,
and
Sir
Francis
,
whose
anxiety
was
increasing
each
moment
,
followed
with
his
eyes
fixedon
him
alone
,
and
totally
unobservant
of
the
many
curious
glances
thatwas
cast
upon
his
animated
and
anxious
looking
countenance
by
thepassengers
.
<EOS>
They
passed
the
Horse
-
guards
—
the
low
mean
building
which
was
thendevoted
to
other
purposes
,
and
which
is
now
the
treasury
—
and
stillonwards
went
Albert
listlessly
as
before
.
<EOS>
Now
he
turned
down
a
smallstreet
behind
Parliament
-
street
.
<EOS>
Then
another
turning
led
him
intolarge
handsome
thoroughfare
;
his
steps
quickened
and
he
,
at
length
,
paused
by
the
steps
of
a
large
mansion
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
stopped
,
but
kept
his
eyes
rivetted
on
the
young
man
.
<EOS>
He
saw
him
ascend
thesteps
—
could
he
believe
his
eyes
?
<EOS>
Yes
—
it
was
—
it
must
be
Learmont’shouse
.
<EOS>
Then
magistrate
walked
forward
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
mistaken
—
AlbertSeyton
had
entered
the
house
of
Learmont
.
<EOS>
The
surprise
of
themagistrate
was
intense
in
the
extreme
.
<EOS>
Here
was
the
lover
of
Ada
onvisiting
terms
,
if
not
on
more
intimate
ones
,
with
her
worst
foe
.
<EOS>
Whatwas
he
to
think
?
<EOS>
Had
gold
had
its
influence
upon
the
young
man
—
and
hadhe
sold
himself
to
the
wealthy
squire
,
changing
from
a
lover
of
Ada
toone
of
the
conspirators
against
her
peace
?
<EOS>
Was
such
conduct
possible?Or
had
the
professions
of
Albert
Seyton
been
from
the
first
those
of
ahypocrite
?
<EOS>
Had
he
always
been
a
creature
of
Learmont
,
and
only
deputedto
perform
the
part
he
had
played
in
order
the
more
easily
to
entanglethe
young
pure
girl
into
an
inextricable
web
of
villany?As
<EOS>
these
painful
reflections
passed
rapidly
through
the
mind
of
SirFrancis
,
he
saw
a
livery
servant
descend
the
steps
of
Learmont
’s
housebearing
a
letter
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
“I
will
question
this
man
,
”
he
thought
.
<EOS>
“
He
is
going
on
some
message
inthe
neighbourhood
,
and
I
dare
say
will
be
communicative
enough
tosatisfy
me
with
regard
to
the
position
held
by
Albert
Seyton
inLearmont
’s
house
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
man
came
down
the
street
towards
Sir
Francis
,
who
,
when
he
camesufficiently
near
,
said
in
a
careless
manner,—“Was
that
Mr.
Seyton
who
just
now
entered
your
master
’s
house?”“Yes
,
sir
,
”
was
the
reply
.
<EOS>
“Ah
<EOS>
,
I
thought
it
was
he
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
seen
him
for
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
He
isintimate
with
the
squire
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
”“He
is
his
worship
’s
private
secretary
,
sir
.
”“Oh
,
yes
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
Good
morning
,
friend
.
<EOS>
”“Good
morning
,
sir
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
servant
passed
on
,
and
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
stood
a
few
moments
indeep
thought
.
<EOS>
“So
,
”
he
said
,
“
this
lover
of
Ada
’s
turns
out
to
be
Learmont
’s
privatesecretary
.
<EOS>
The
private
secretary
of
a
villain
should
be
like
hismaster
,
and
if
the
young
man
be
a
faithful
servant
,
he
is
no
fit
matchfor
Ada
.
<EOS>
He
must
be
in
league
,
with
Learmont
in
all
his
atrocities
,
else
would
he
,
occupying
the
situation
he
does
,
be
a
sore
encumbranceto
such
a
man
as
the
squire
.
<EOS>
The
facts
speak
plainly
—
a
confidentialservant
of
a
man
like
Learmont
can
only
be
one
degree
removed
from
hisprincipal
in
villany
,
and
that
degree
must
be
one
deeper
still
.
<EOS>
Is
itpossible
that
this
young
man
,
who
spoke
so
fairly
—
who
looked
so
frankand
candid
,
and
in
whom
I
,
with
all
my
practice
of
human
nature
,
coulddiscover
nothing
<EOS>
but
what
was
manly
and
interesting
in
his
firstinterview
with
me
—
is
it
possible
that
he
can
be
one
employed
to
do
thedirty
work
of
such
a
man
as
Squire
Learmont
?
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
Such
ishumanity
.
<EOS>
Surely
some
sort
of
presentiment
of
this
—
some
specialinterposition
of
Providence
in
favour
of
the
good
and
pure
—
must
haveinduced
me
,
for
Ada
’s
sake
,
to
follow
him
thus
,
instead
of
permitting
arecognition
in
the
streets
.
<EOS>
A
fine
tale
would
this
private
secretaryhave
had
for
the
ears
of
his
master
—
that
the
simple
,
easily
duped
SirFrancis
Hartleton
had
in
his
care
the
object
,
for
some
reason
,
of
hisbitterest
hatred
,
and
that
he
,
the
sweet
tongued
,
honied
-
accented
,
private
secretary
was
welcomed
as
the
accepted
lover
,
and
had
freeingress
and
egress
to
the
house
in
which
she
lived
—
could
concert
whatplots
and
plans
he
liked
—
nay
,
could
take
her
very
life
for
a

.
<EOS>
Thank
Heaven
,
for
unmasking
so
much
villany
.
<EOS>
”Sir
<EOS>
Francis
Hartleton
<EOS>
’s
<EOS>
face
was
flushed
,
and
there
was
resentment
athis
heart
,
as
he
walked
with
hasty
steps
past
Learmont
’s
house
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
,
however
,
proceeded
far
when
he
heard
his
name
mentioned
bysome
one
behind
him
,
and
,
suddenly
turning
he
saw
,
within
a
few
pacesof
him
,
the
object
of
his
present
angry
thoughts
—
<EOS>
namely
,
Albert
Seyton
,
who
had
left
Learmont
’s
house
upon
seeing
the
magistrate
from
a
windowof
the
little
room
by
the
hall
.
<EOS>
“I
may
as
well
,
”
thought
Albert
,
“
see
him
—
<EOS>
not
that
I
have
any
hopesbeyond
those

said
Sir

in

very
amiable
voice

“Do

”“You

Good

”“Not

said
Sir

as
he
walked
away
,
leaving

After
a
few
moments

thought
,
he
said,—“Now

I
have
not

lingering
doubt

<EOS>
What
Learmont
hinted
of

true

”“The

stridinghomewards
in

<EOS>
“

Twas
never

out
of

<EOS>
Ihave
no

that

<EOS>
Thank
Heaven

Ada

<EOS>
”Sir
<EOS>
Francis
proceeded
home
as
quickly
as
he
could
;
but
as
he
neared
hisown
door
,
the
thought
came
over
him
of
how
he
was
to
inform
Ada
of
thediscovery
he
had
made
;
for
although
his
own
suspicions
were
strongagainst
Learmont
,
and
the
scraps
of
paper
he
had
procured
from
poor
hadsupplied
some
wanting
links
in
the
chain
of
his
conjectures
,
he
hadabstained
from
fully
explaining
to
Ada
sufficient
to
make
her
nowcomprehend
why
Albert
’s
engagement
with
the
rich
squire
should
placesuch
an
insurmountable
barrier
between
them
.
<EOS>
“She
<EOS>
must
now
know
,
all
,
”
he
thought
,
“
and
perhaps
it
is
far
betterthat
she
should
,
as
at
all
events
she
will
,
in
her
own
thoughts
,
bebetter
able
to
separate
her
friends
from
her
enemies
.
<EOS>
I
will
now
,
however
,
plan
another
watch
upon
the
squire
’s
house
,
in
order
toascertain
if
this
young
spark
is
in
any
communication
with
Jacob
Gray
,
or
only
an
agent
of
the
squire
<EOS>
’s
.

He
may
be
playing

”CHAPTER
<EOS>
XCVII.The
Visit
to
Gray
’s
House.—Learmont
’s
Exultation
.
<EOS>
While
Albert
Seyton
was
absent
on
his
errand
of
following
Jacob
Gray
,
Learmont
was
a
prey
to
the
keenest
anxiety
,
and
he
could
neither
sitnor
walk
for
any
length
of
time
,
<EOS>
such
was
the
exquisite
agony
of
mindhe
suffered
at
the
thought
that
,
after
all
,
the
young
man
might
fail
inhis
mission
,
either
from
want
of
tact
or
from
over
-
forwardness
.
<EOS>
Thefirst
supposition
of
failure
presented
itself
to
the
squire
<EOS>
’s
mind
inby
<EOS>
no
means
such
disagreeable
colours
as
the
last
;
for
,
even
admittingthat
the
wily
Jacob
Gray
should
on
this
one
occasion
succeed
in
eludingAlbert
’s
<EOS>
pursuit
,
there
would
arise
many
other
opportunities
forrenewing
the
same
plan
of
operations
with
greater
chances
of
success
,
because
with
greater
experience
;
but
should
Jacob
Gray
once
catch
aglance
of
Albert
Seyton
,
all
hope
of
successfully
tracing
him
to
hishouse
,
<EOS>
through
the
means
of
the
young
lovers
would
be
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
As
minute
after
minute
winged
their
heavy
flight
,
Learmont
’s
mentalfever
increased
,
until
it
became
,
at
length
,
almost
insupportable
.
<EOS>
Hestrode
to
and
fro
in
his
apartment
with
hasty
steps
;
then
he
threwhimself
into
a
chair
;
then
he
would
raise
a
cup
of
wine
to
his
lips
,
but
to
lay
it
down
again
untasted
,
as
he
thought
to
himself,—“No
,
I
must
keep
my
mind
now
clear
and
active
;
for
should
he
besuccessful
<EOS>
,
I
shall
have
need
of
my
mental
energy
to
turn
the
occasionto
advantage
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
,
even
when
discovered
,
is
not
destroyed
.
<EOS>
It
isone
thing
to
track
the
fox
to
his
lair
,
and
another
to
kill
him
.
<EOS>
Therewill
yet
remain
much
to
be
done
,
even
if
my
most
sanguine
hopes
arerealised
through
the
instrumentality
of
Albert
Seyton
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
thought
then
crossed
his
mind
of
parading
through
the
various
roomsof
his
mansion
in
order
to
divert
the
anxiety
that
was
preying
uponhim
;
and
taking
a
light
in
his
hand
,
he
commenced
a
tour
somewhatsimilar
to
the
one
he
had
undertaken
when
first
he
arrived
in
London
,
only
that
he
was
now
alone
and
the
freshness
of
his
enjoyment
of
allthe
glitter
and
splendour
which
surrounded
him
on
every
side
was
wornoff
.
<EOS>
In
the
double
action
of
walking
and
constant
change
of
place
,
Learmontdid
find
some
little
relief
.
<EOS>
“He
will
be
successful
,
”
he
muttered
,
“
and
Jacob
Gray
will
bedestroyed
.
<EOS>
He
must
be
successful
.
<EOS>
Why
should
he
not
?
<EOS>
There
are
athousand
chances
to
one
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
Then
I
shall
breathe
freely
;
theheaviest
load
that
ever
pressed
upon
my
heart
will
be
lifted
from
it
;
Ishall
no
longer
totter
and
turn
sick
and
giddy
on
the
brink
of
theprecipice
which
has
so
long
,
as
it
were
,
yawned
at
my
feet
;
I
shallknow
peace
—
peace
of
mind
,
and
,
by
cultivating
the
enjoyment
of
thepresent
I
shall
,
in
a
short
time
,
learn
to
forget
the
past
.
<EOS>
Forget
—
forget
—
<EOS>
can
I
ever
forget
?
<EOS>
Even
now
a
voice
seems
to
ring
in
myear
with
a
fearful
cry
.
<EOS>
Blood
—
aloud
it
shrieks
;
can
blood
ever
beforgotten
?
<EOS>
Can
the
cry
of
the
dying
man
?
<EOS>
Can
the
wail
of
the
fatherlesschild
ever
fade
from
the
memory
of
him
who
has
heard
them
as
I
<EOS>
have?Can
<EOS>
I
ever
be
happy
?
<EOS>
Was
I
ever
happy
?
<EOS>
Yes
,
once
;
I
was
a
child
once
,
and
my
heart
was
spotless
as
a
pearl
within
its
shell
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
could
Irecall
the
past
!
<EOS>
But
that
is
madness
.
<EOS>
The
past
is
gone
,
and
may
not
bebeckoned
back
again
.
<EOS>
If
man
could
undo
the
folded
scroll
of
eventswhich
have
,
in
the
course
of
years
,
taken
their
progress
,
it
seems
tome
that
human
nature
would
reach
some
few
brief
years
of
its
onwardmarch
,
and
then
be
ever
toiling
back
again
to
undo
what
was
done
.
<EOS>
Whichof
us
,
if
we
could
live
again
from
earliest
infancy
the
same
life
,
would
do
as
we
have
done
?
<EOS>
I
am
no
worse
than
others
.
<EOS>
The
wisest
,
thebest
have
felt
as
I
feel
now
.
<EOS>
The
blood
—
blood
—
the
curse
of
blood
!
<EOS>
Whowhispers
that
to
my
heart
?
<EOS>
I
did
not
do
the
deed
;
it
was
the
savagesmith
;
my
hands
reeked
not
with
the
gore
.
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
no
.
<EOS>
Hence
,
horribleshadows
of
the
soul
,
hence

hence
—
I
—
I
am

,
I
will
not
be

<EOS>
”His
<EOS>
whole
frame
trembled
;
and
as
was
usual
with
him
,
when
consciencewhispered
with
its
awful
voice
his
crimes
to
his
shrinking
soul
,
hefelt
an
utter
prostration
of
every
physical
energy
,
and
could
scarcelycrawl
to
his
room
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
moment
that
he
reached
the
door
,
Albert
Seyton
,
flushed
,
excited
,
and
nearly
breathless
,
reached
it
likewise
.
<EOS>
Learmont
darted
towards
him
,
and
clutching
his
arm
with
franticeagerness
,
shrieked
,
rather
than
said,—“Found
—
<EOS>
found?”“Yes
,
yes
,
”
cried
Albert
.
<EOS>
“You
—
you
have
traced
the
villain
to
his
lair
?
<EOS>
You
know
where
you
couldlay
your
hand
upon
his
throat
as
he
sleeps
?
<EOS>
You
could
tear
his
heartout
?
<EOS>
He
<EOS>
—
he
saw
you
not
,
you
are
sure
?
<EOS>
Swear
by
heaven
and
hell
<EOS>
you
havefound
his
home!”“I
have
,
sir
,
”
said
Albert
,
amazed
at
the
vehemence
and
wild
excitementof
Learmont
;
“
with
some
difficulty
,
but
still
with
complete
success
,
Ihave
traced
him
,
and
know
at
this
moment
where
to
find
him
.
<EOS>
”“So
,
so
,
”
said
Learmont
,
with
a
sickly
smile
,
“
I
—
<EOS>
I
much
rejoice
foryour
sake
—
for
your
sake
,
Albert
Seyton
,
I
do

<EOS>
Let

let
me
leanon
you
a
moment
;
a
sudden
faintness—”“Shall
I
summon
your
attendants
,
sir
?
”
<EOS>
said
Albert
,
much
alarmed
at
theghastly
looks
of
the
squire
,
who
tremblingly
held
him
by
the
arm
.
<EOS>
“No
,
no
,
”
said
Learmont
;
“
’
tis
nothing
,
I
shall
be
better
presently
.
<EOS>
Ifelt
much
for
you
that
it
made
me
over
anxious
,

so
,

asI
am

a
nervous
temperament
<EOS>
,
I
tremble
for

<EOS>
There
is
wine
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
”Albert
led
the
squire
into
the
room
,
and
then
poured
out
and
presentedto
him
some
wine
,
which
he
drank
with
eagerness
,
after
which
,
drawing
along
breath
,
he
said,—“I
am
much
better
now;—and
<EOS>
so
you
found
him
.
<EOS>
Do
you
not
rejoice?”“Indeed
I
do

said
Albert
,
“
and
<EOS>
much
I
long
for
you
to
remove
allrestrictions

to
proceed

<EOS>
”“All
shall
be
speedily
accomplished

”
said
Learmont
;
“

Not

<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
scarcely
understand

”
said
Albert
,
who
really
thought
thesquire
must
be
a
little
insane
<EOS>
,
he
talked
so
strangely
.
<EOS>
“Not

Learmont

<EOS>
“

near

he
traversed
thrice
the

needed
to

<EOS>
”“’Tis

said
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“
Most
like

<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
know
not
the
name
of

,
but
I
could
guide

<EOS>
”Learmont
<EOS>
sprung
to
his
feet
.
<EOS>
“Now

<EOS>
On

”
he
cried
.
<EOS>
“
My

my

.
<EOS>
You
shall
showme
now
.
<EOS>
”Then
<EOS>
suddenly
speaking
in
a
subdued
tone
,
he
added,—“You
see
,
Mr.
Seyton
,
that
I
am
an
enthusiast
,
and
what
I
take
aninterest
in
possesses
my
mind
most
fully
.
<EOS>
You
perceive
that
havingpromised
you
to
stir
in
this
matter
<EOS>
,
I
am
inclined
to
do
so
well
,
andamply
so
;
you
shall
show
me
the
house
in
which
this
man
lives
,
and
thenI
will
mature
some
plan
which
we
can
jointly
put
in
execution
when
wemeet
again

<EOS>
You
understand
me
quite
,
Mr.
Seyton?”“I
do
,
sir
,
and
am
most
thankful
to
you
.
<EOS>
”“You
shall
have
cause
to
thank
me
,
”
said
Learmont
—
then
as
a
servantappeared
in
answer
to
the
bell
he
had
sounded
,
he
cried
in
a
loudvoice,—“My
hat
and
sword
.
<EOS>
Quick
—
my
sword!”Both
were
instantly
brought
to
him
,
and
he
commenced
hastily
descendingthe
stairs
with
his
sword
in
his
hand
,
and
a
flush
of
excitement
on
hisbrow
,
that
made
him
look
widely
different
to
the
pale
trembling
man
hewas
but
a
few
short
minutes
before
.
<EOS>
“Pray
Heaven
,
”
thought
Albert
,
“
his
wits
be
not
deranged
.
<EOS>
It
would
besad
indeed
if
my
only
friend
were
to
turn
out
a
madman
.
<EOS>
”They
were
soon
in
the
street
,
and
Learmont
taking
Albert
by
the
arm
,
said,—“Remember
your
promise
,
and
make
no
sort
of
demonstration
of
yourpresence
,
until
I
shall
permit
you
.
<EOS>
All
now
depends
upon
yourdiscretion
.
<EOS>
Lead
me
now
as
quickly
as
you
can
to
this
man
’s
abode
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
owe
you
too
much
,
sir
,
”
said
Albert
,
“
to
quarrel
with
your
commands
,
whatever
restraint
they
may
put
upon
my
own
inclination
.
<EOS>
I
shallcontrol
my
impatience
until
the
time
you
mention
.
”“Do
<EOS>
so
.
<EOS>
Then
as
a
reward
,
I
will
contrive
some
means
of
providing
foryou
,
so
that
you
shall
never
know
again
<EOS>
what
care
and
trouble
are
.
<EOS>
Youshall

a
happy
destiny
.
<EOS>
”These
words
were
uttered
in
a
tone
so
strange
,
that
Albert
,
looked
inLearmont
’s
face
,
to
see
what
expressions
accompanied
them
,
and
there
hesaw
a
lurking
smile
which
brought
a
disagreeable
feeling
of
suspicionto
his
heart
for
a
moment
,
but
no
longer
,
for
he
chased
it
away
<EOS>
againby
reflecting
what
possible
motive
could
Learmont
have
for
firstraising
his
hopes
and
then
crushing
them
;
if
,
indeed
,
he
had
notalready
gone
too
far
to
be
of
any
detriment
,
if
he
was
of
noassistance
,
by
enabling
him
,
Albert
,
to
discover
the
abode
of
JacobGray
,
and
as
he
fondly
imagined
that
likewise
of
his
beloved
and
deeplyregretted
Ada
.
<EOS>
“No

”
he

I

<EOS>
He
who
has
done
so
muchfor

the
casual

suspicion

may

”“Is

replied
Albert

<EOS>
“
If

”“Indeed?”“Aye

<EOS>
A

followed
him
closely

even
as
I
did

took
up
astation

in

<EOS>
”“That

<EOS>
said
Learmont
,
with
a
troubled

<EOS>
“It
is

I
can
not
account
for

In

Learmont

In

Learmont
,
with
feelings

<EOS>
“I

as
for

werehe

I

prophesy

the
doseshall
be
skilfully
graduated

so
that
some
hours
shall
elapse

he
may
lie
down

diein

where

lists

he
is

”He
<EOS>
then
paused
,
and
tearing
a
leaf
from
his
pocket
-
book
,
he
wrote
on
itthe
words
which
we
are
aware
were
on
the
note
Britton
received
in
themidst
of
his
drunken
orgies
at
the
Chequers
,
and
which
Learmont
gotconveyed
to
him
by
means
of
a
boy
who
was
wandering
houseless
about
thestreets
.
<EOS>
Satisfied
,
then
,
that
he
had
everything
in
train
for
the
destruction
ofJacob
Gray
,
Learmont
bent
his
steps
homewards
in
a
more
satisfied
stateof
mind
than
he
had
ever
been
in
before
,
and
resolved
to
attemptimmediately
to
procure
some
sleep
,
before
he
should
thoroughly
maturehis
yet
but
projected
plan
of
murdering
Gray
on
the
next
evening
.
<EOS>
The
difficulties
in
the
way
of
executing
the
deed
safely
and
securelywere
very
great
;
for
not
only
was
Gray
to
be
destroyed
,
but
his
writtenconfession
was
to
be
secured
before
its
superscription
should
beperceived
by
any
one
who
might
officiously
communicate
to
themagistrate
that
such
a
document
had
been
addressed
to
him
.
<EOS>
To
accomplish
all
this
required
skill
,
courage
,
caution
,
and
afavourable
train
of
circumstances
;
but
,
wearied
as
was
Learmont
then
,
as
well
by
the
violence
of
his
alternating
passions
,
as
by
want
ofanything
in
the
shape
of
refreshing
sleeps
for
some
nights
,
he
felthimself
unequal
to
the
details
of
a
plan
which
should
command
success
,
if
no
very
extraordinary
obstacle
presented
itself
in
his
way
.
<EOS>
Hetherefore
hurried
home
,
and
giving
directions
to
be
called
at
an
earlyhour
in
the
morning
<EOS>
,
he
threw
off
some
of
his
upper
clothing
,
andwearied
as
he
was
,
soon
sunk
into
a
slumber
—
<EOS>
not
,
however
,
a
calm
andeasy
one
,
for
he
was
,
as
usual
,
tortured
with
frightful
dreams
,
andimages
of
terror
flitted
before
his
mental
vision
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
he
wouldfancy
himself
in
the
midst
of
the
fathomless
ocean
,
tossed
about
at
themercy
of
every
surge
,
while
each
wave
that
burst
over
him
seemedcrusted
with
blood
.
<EOS>
Ravenous
monsters
of
the
deep
would
stretch
theirlong
tendril
-
like
arms
from
deep
vallies
in
the
ocean
’s
bed
,
and
striveto
drag
him
into
their
insatiate
maws
;
then
suddenly
,
“
a
change
wouldcome
<EOS>
o’er
<EOS>
the
spirit
of
his
dream
,
”
and
he
would
lie
upon
the
burningsands
of
Africa
.
<EOS>
For
hundreds
of
miles
there
would
be
nothing
butsand
—
sand
hot
and
scorching
to
the
touch
as
the
fire
-
ash
of
a
glowingfurnace
—
then
a
fearful
drought
came
over
him
,
and
he
shrieked
forwater
,
and
thought
what
a
heaven
it
would
be
to
be
once
more
dashedmadly
to
and
fro
by
the
surging
waves
—
then
a
caravan
would
appear
insight
upon
the
pathless
desert
—
he
heard
the
tinkle
of
the
camel’sbells
—
he
saw
the
weary
men
,
with
bronze
complexions
and
travel
-
wornapparel
,
come
slowly
on
and
he
saw
that
they
had
water
,
for
all
weredrinking
deep
draughts
of
the
delicious
beverage
.
<EOS>
One
then
asked
him
ifhe
too
would
drink
,
and
then
he
could
not
speak
.
<EOS>
His
tongue
seemedglued
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
,
and
,
one
by
one
,
as
they
passed
him
by
,
they
asked
him
to
drink
,
and
he
could
not
say
yes
.
<EOS>
Then
,
the
caravanslowly
faded
away
and
when
the
last
man
was
far
across
sandy
the
plain
,
his
voice
came
again
,
and
he
shrieked
for
water
—
for
but
one
drop
toquench
for
a
passing
moment
the
burning
fever
of
his
throat
.
<EOS>
The
dream
was
horrible
,
but
the
vision
that
followed
was
more
terrible
,
because
the
suffering
was
mental
as
well
as
physical
.
<EOS>
Learmont
fancied
he
was
at
the
foot
of
a
high
winding
staircase
.
<EOS>
Hecommenced
slowly
ascending
,
and
then
he
heard
behind
him
like
a
soundof
rushing
wind
,
and
looking
back
,
he
saw
linked
,
in
an
awfulcompanionship
,
three
livid
spectres
,
as
if
fresh
from
the
reekingcorruptions
of
the
tomb
.
<EOS>
The
flesh
hung
rag
-
like
upon
the
yellowmoistened
bones
,
and
huge
drops
of
green
and
sickly
corruption
felldashing
like
the
preludes
of
a
thunder
storm
,
upon
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
Wormsand
moist
things
were
crawling
in
and
out
the
sightless
eyes
—
therattling
lips
grinned
horribly
,
and
amid
the
havoc
of
the
grave
,
Learmont
could
recognise
the
features
of
those
whom
he
had
driven
todeath
.
<EOS>
Slowly
they
came
after
him
,
and
a
voice
seemed
to
ring
in
hisears
,
saying,—“They
will
catch
you
,
and
fold
you
in
their
dreadful
embrace
,
ere
youreach
the
top
of
those
stairs
.
<EOS>
Fly
,
Learmont
,
fly!”Then
<EOS>
he
tried
,
with
a
scream
of
terror
,
to
ascend
the
staircase
likethe
wind
,
but
his
feet
seemed
glued
to
the
steps
,
and
he
could
ascendbut
slowly
step
by
step
,
while
he
felt
that
his
pursuers
were
gainingon
him
momentarily
,
and
that
he
must
in
another
moment
be
in
theirgrasp
.
<EOS>
He
heard
the
chattering
of
the
fleshless
gums
—
he
smelt
the
rankodour
of
the
grave
,
and
yet
he
could
proceed
but
<EOS>
at
a
funeral
pace
.
<EOS>
Nowthey
were
upon
him
—
now
they
gibbered
in
his
ears
—
they
clutched
him
bythe
throat
—
the
long
skeleton
fingers
press
upon
his
throat
<EOS>
—
he
his
lost!One
moan
bust
from
the
agonised
sleeper
,
and
he
awoke
shrieking,—“Help
—
help
!
<EOS>
Save
me
yet
,
Heaven
—
<EOS>
oh
,
save
me
<EOS>
,
I
do
repent
!
<EOS>
God
havemercy
upon
me!”He
sprung
from
his
bed
,
and
,
with
dishevelled
hair
,
eyes
starting
fromtheir
sockets
,
and
a
face
livid
with
agony
,
he
sunk
upon
his
knees
,
just
as
the
terrified
domestics
,
hearing
his
cries
,
knocked
loudly
athis
chamber
door
.
<EOS>
Then
succeeded
a
death
-
like
stillness
,
and
Learmont
,
in
a
deepsepulchral
voice
,
said,—“God
of
Heaven
,
was
it
a
dream
?
<EOS>
Dare
I
ever
sleep
again?”The
knocking
continued
at
his
door
,
and
he
rose
to
his
feet
.
<EOS>
“Peace
—
peace
!
”
<EOS>
he
cried
.
<EOS>
“
Away
,
I
did
but
dream
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
servants
retired
from
the
door
gazing
at
each
other
in
mute
terror
,
for
Learmont
’s
cries
had
alarmed
the
whole
house
,
and
filled
them
withsuperstitious
fears
.
<EOS>
“So
—
<EOS>
so
,
”
said
the
squire
,
when
he
trimmed
his
light
,
and
recovered
alittle
from
his
state
of
mental
excitement
;
“
that
was
a
dream
—
howterrible

how
terrible

<EOS>
Can
I
ever

again
in

downmy
weary
head
upon

hope

<EOS>
No

And

that
I
have
heard
wrap

create

To

Faith

Confidence

Generous
Heart
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
was
never
so
much
vexed
in
his
life
as
he
was
atthe
supposed
treachery
of
Albert
Seyton
.
<EOS>
He
revolved
in
his
mind
overand
over
again
,
how
he
should
tell
Ada
of
the
scene
that
had
occurredbetween
him
and
her
lover
,
and
of
all
his
suspicions
concerning
him
,
and
at
length
he
resolved
that
Lady
Hartleton
should
be
the
medium
ofcommunicating
<EOS>
the
unwelcome
intelligence
of
Albert
’s
defection
from
hislove
and
entertainment
by
Ada
’s
worst
enemy
.
<EOS>
For
this
purpose
it
became
necessary
that
Ada
should
be
put
inpossession
of
more
facts
concerning
herself
than
the
humane
andconsiderate
magistrate
<EOS>
had
,
as
yet
,
thought
proper
to
burthen
her
mindwith
.
<EOS>
This
he
much
regretted
,
because
he
had
hoped
that
before
he
hadoccasion
to
mention
Learmont
<EOS>
’s
name
particularly
to
Ada
,
he
should
beable
to
couple
with
it
something
more
than
mere
surmises
<EOS>
,
however
wellfounded
such
surmises
might
be
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
in
his
own
private
room
,
considering
deeply
and
painfullythis
matter
,
a
note
arrived
to
him
,
which
was
immediately
anothersource
of
vexation
,
inasmuch
as
it
hurried
on
the
events
which
he
wouldhave
<EOS>
been
glad
to
see
develop
themselves
a
little
further
before
heactively
interfered
in
them
.
<EOS>
The
letter
was
from
the
Secretary
of
State
,
intimating
that
the
chargesconfidentially
made
against
Learmont
,
by
him
,
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
must
either
be
abandoned
,
or
speedily
proved
,
for
that
a
dissolution
ofParliament
was
about
to
take
place
,
and
it
was
absolutely
necessary
toknow
in
whose
hands
the
Learmont
property
was
.
<EOS>
“This
,
”
said
Sir
Francis
,
as
he
laid
down
the
minister
’s
note
,
“
mustbring
affairs
to
a
crisis
.
<EOS>
I
must
apprehend
Jacob
Gray
now
,
andBritton
,
and
trust
to
one
or
other
of
them
committing
Learmont
;
aslender
,
hope
,
I
am
afraid
,
since
no
mercy
can
be
offered
to
Gray
onaccount
of
Vaughan
’s
business
,
and
Britton
is
the
last
person
to
expecta
confession
from
.
<EOS>
”Sir
<EOS>
Francis
then
took
from
a
secret
drawer
the
small
scraps
of
paperwhich
he
procured
from
mad
Maud
,
and
read
them
again
attentively
.
<EOS>
“These
are
interesting
to
me
,
”
he
said
,
“
as
leading
me
on
in
my
chainof
conjecture
;
but
they
are
no
evidence
,
for
,
first
of
all
,
who
is
toprove
they
were
ever
written
by
Jacob
Gray
,
or
in
his
possession
;
andsecondly
,
they
are
too
vague
in
themselves
to
be
of
any
importance
,
unless
merely
used
as
evidence
corroborative
of
facts
which
can
benearly
proved
without
them
.
<EOS>
The
question
now
is
,
has
Gray
written
afull
disclosure
of
who
Ada
<EOS>
is
,
and
what
crime
has
led
to
her
beingplaced
in
so
singular
a
position
,
or
not
?
<EOS>
Well
,
I
will
crave
of
theminister
another
week
;
and
then
consent
to
withdraw
my
charges
againstLearmont
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
He
must
triumph
,
I
suppose
,
and
I
can
not
helpit
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
then
sought
Lady
Hartleton
,
and
informing
her
of
what
he
haddiscovered
concerning
Albert
,
begged
her
to
communicate
the
same
to
Adaas
carefully
as
she
could
,
so
as
not
to
shock
her
sensitive
mind
toosuddenly
with
the
news
of
the
bad
faith
of
him
to
whom
she
had
givenher
heart
.
<EOS>
Lady
Hartleton
was
so
much
accustomed
to
rely
upon
the
judgment
of
herhusband
,
that
,
although
she
was
not
without
some
lingering
doubts
,
after
all
there
might
be
some
possible
explanation
of
the
conduct
ofher
lover
,
she
consented
to
the
task
which
was
set
her
,
and
immediatelywent
to
Ada
to
communicate
the
sad
intelligence
.
<EOS>
“My
dear
Ada
,
”
said
Lady
Hartleton
,
“
there
are
circumstances
which
haveinduced
Sir
Francis
not
to
ask
Mr.
Seyton
to
come
here
.
<EOS>
”Ada
started
,
and
with
a
heightened
colour
she
said
in
her
soft
gentlevoice,—“Lady
,
you
have
already
done
too
much
for
the
poor

friendless
girlwhom

ought
never
to
have
accepted—”“Now
,
Ada
<EOS>
,

mistake
me

”
interrupted
Lady
Hartleton
,
<EOS>
“
the
causewhich
prevented
Sir
Francis
from
bringing
Albert
here
with
him
,
has
noreference
to
anything

the
young
man
’s
want
of

”“Albert

said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“Yes

my

a
great

when
I
tell
you
that
Albert
Seyton
is
in

service

there
is
good
cause
of
suspicion

<EOS>
”“Suspicion

”Ada
<EOS>

”Ada

could

the

immediately
left
the

While
this
conversation

so
painfully
interesting

wasproceeding
between

Sir
Francis
was
informedthat
the

had
set
upon

by

wishedparticularly
to
see

upon

informed

his

the
evening

his
fears

“A

<EOS>
By
nine
o’clock
,
according
to
his
appointment
with
Andrew
Britton
,
Learmont
was
in
the
park
.
<EOS>
His
face
was
dreadfully
pale
—
his
limbs
shookunder
him
as
he
gladly
availed
himself
of
one
of
the
wooden
seats
onwhich
to
rest
his
wearied
and
exhausted
frame
.
<EOS>
“When
will
this
end
?
”
<EOS>
he
muttered
.
<EOS>
“
Four
nights
now
without
repose
—
I
amsinking
into
the
grave
;
yet
this
last
night
,
with
its
feverish
dreams
,
and
awful
spectral
visitations
,
has
been
much
the
worst
I
ever
passed
.
<EOS>
Surely
it
must
have
arisen
from
my
great
anxiety
just
now
concerningJacob
Gray
,
and
when
he
is
dead
I
shall
have
some
peace
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
then
,
surely
,
I
shall
feel
much
relieved
,
but
not
till
then
—
not
till
then

<EOS>
’Tis
<EOS>
the
time
,
and
yet
Andrew
Britton
comes
not

<EOS>
Dare
he
refuse
to
obeymy
summons
?
<EOS>
Or
is
he
sleeping
off
some
deep
drunkenness
of
lastevening

and
deaf
to

<EOS>
The
sot
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
do
without
him
in

Gray
may
be
armed
,

he
may
even
procure
assistance

in

sufficient

me
think

<EOS>
Yes
—
<EOS>
yes

<EOS>
’Twere
far
better
to
kill
him
in
his
own
abode
than
in
mine

<EOS>
Of
whatuse
is
his
confession
to
him
,

placed
somewhere
where
it
may
beeasily
found

<EOS>
None
<EOS>
whatever

<EOS>
I
shall
be
able
easily
to
lay
my

uponit
,
and
when
I
have
that
document
once
fairly
in
my
grasp
,
I
shall
feelmyself
again
.
<EOS>
I
and
Britton
will
go
at
midnight
,
and
make
our
way
<EOS>
intothe
house
as
best
we
can
.
<EOS>
No
lock
can
stand
the
practised
skill

and
,
from
the
ancient
grudge
he
has
to
Jacob
Gray
,
he
will
enterinto
this
affair
with
a
good
will
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
he
will
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
I
caninflame
his
passion
ere
<EOS>
we
go

”Learmont
began
to
get
very
impatient
,
as
Britton
did
not
make
hisappearance
;
and
,
after
waiting
a
full
hour
beyond
the
specified
time
,
he
rose
from
the
seat
,
and
,
with
a
bitter
execration
on
his
lips
,
hewalked
slowly
in
the
direction
in
which
Britton
must
come
in
proceedingfrom
the
Chequers
.
<EOS>
Still
the
squire
met
him
not
,
and
finally
,
he
left
the
park
,
byStorey
’s
Gate
,
and
walked
on
until
he
came
within
sight
of
the
ancienthotel
in
which
the
unconscious
Britton
was
lying
fast
asleep
,
with
nogreat
prospect
of
arousing
himself
for
some
hours
to
come
.
<EOS>
Learmont
paused
as
he
said,—“Now
<EOS>
,
if
I
thought
there
was
no
chance
of
being
known
,
I
would
callupon
the
savage
smith
,
and
at
once
ascertain
the
cause
of
this
brokenappointment

<EOS>
Let
me
consider
—
I
have
not
seen
him
for
a
week
—
perchancehe
is
ill
—
perchance
dead

<EOS>
The
latter
would
be
a
blessed
release
,
ifJacob
Gray
preceded
him
,
and
he
left
no
damning
evidence
behind

in

I
have
always

<EOS>
I
think
I
may
venture
—
the
stakeI
have
in
hand
is
worth
the
risk
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
will
make
inquiry
,
for
ifJacob
Gray
dies
not
to

night

I
shall
have
another
night
of
misery
<EOS>

oh!I

assured

<EOS>
”Learmont
<EOS>
,
however
,
still
lingered
,
ere
he
could
make
up
his
mind
tocall
upon
the
drunken
smith
,
at
the
Chequers
,
for
he
was
most
fearfulthat
<EOS>
such
an
act
,
trifling
as
it
was
,
might
form
a
link
in
the
chain
ofevidence
against
him
,
should
any
accidental
circumstances
occur
to
fixsuspicion
upon
him
,
after
Gray
’s
murder
should
have
been
achieved
.
<EOS>
“And
<EOS>
yet
,
”
he
reasoned
,
“
what
can
I
do
?
<EOS>
Stay
,
a
thought
strikes
me
—
Ican
send
some
one
with
an
inquiry
,
and
then
shape
my
own
conduct
by
theanswer
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
yon
poor
beggar
-
woman
,
with
her
squalid
children
,
will
,
forthe
promise
of
an
alms
,
do
my
errand

<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
walked
up
to
a
miserable
looking
object
,
who
was
shivering
upon
adoor
-
step
,
with
some
wretched
-
looking
children
around
her
.
<EOS>
The
momenthe
showed
an
intention
of
speaking
to
her
,
she
commenced
a
piteousappeal
for
charity
.
<EOS>
“Oh
,
sir
—
kind
sir
,
”
she
said
,
“
bestow
a
trifle
upon
a
starving
widow

<EOS>
”Learmont
<EOS>
reeled
from
the
woman
as
she
spoke
,
and
he
felt
that
him
shespoke
of
was
the
man
who
had
met
so
cruel
a
death
from
his
hand
.
<EOS>
“Not

he
muttered
.
<EOS>
“
I

”The
<EOS>
woman
’s
voice
sunk
into
a
low
wail
of
anguish
and
despair
,
as
shesaw
Learmont
turn
away
,
and
then
bursting
into
tears

she
sobbed
overher

”Learmont
walked
hastily
towards
the
Chequers
,
and
early
as
it
was
,
sounds
of
mirth
and
revelry
were
issuing
from
it
.
<EOS>
Bond

the
butcher

was
waiting
for

rise

amusing
himself
by
chantingBacchanalian

the

drinking
deeply

<EOS>
His

<EOS>
Learmont

,
and
he
wondered
who
it
could
be
that
sorivalled
even
the
lungs
of
Britton
,
as
he
heard
the
following
strains:—“Up

”Learmont
stepped
into
the
dingy
,
dark
passage
,
and
making
his
way
up
<EOS>
tothe
bar
,
he
,
in
an
assumed
voice
,
said,—“A
cup
of
your
best
wine
,
landlord
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
wine
was
placed
before
him
,
and
then
he
said
in
a
careless
tone,—“Has
Master
Britton
risen
yet?”“Oh
,
dear
,
no

”
said
the
landlord
.
<EOS>
“
He
wo

<EOS>
He
went
out
in

last

camehome
all

<EOS>
Oh

He

”“Indeed
<EOS>
it
is

<EOS>
”A
<EOS>
violent
pull
from
the
parlour
bell
now
induced
the
landlord
to
rushfrom
his
bar
to
answer
it
,
with
the
exclamation
of,—“That
<EOS>
’s

<EOS>
He

as

<EOS>
”“In
<EOS>

”
muttered
Learmont
to
himself
,
as
he
glanced
round
him
,
and
saw
that
he
was
alone
,
and
the
staircase
leading
to
the
upper
partof
the
house
immediately
before
him
.
<EOS>
“
I
will
go

see
him

<EOS>
Mybusiness
brooks
<EOS>

<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
accordingly
ascended
the
stairs
,
and
was
half
way
up
before
thelandlord
came
back
.
<EOS>
“Well
,
I
never
,
”
exclaimed
the
host
;
“
fairly
done
out
of
a
cup
of
thebest
wine
in

.
<EOS>
He
looked
a
very
respectable
man
,
too
,
thoughno

.
<EOS>
Who
would
have
thought
he
’d
have
gone
off
without
paying
inthis
minute
?
<EOS>
The
villain!”The
landlord
walked
to
the
door
,
and
looked
up
and
down
the
street;then
<EOS>
he
came
back
,
shaking
his
head
,
as
he
said,—“How
<EOS>
he
must
have
run
,
too
,
for
he
ai
n’t

<EOS>
Well

<EOS>
To

<EOS>
He

well
roba

had
just
about
as
much
idea
of
bilking
the
landlord
out
ofpayment
for
his
wine
as
he
had
of
robbing
a
church
;
but
his
mind
hadbeen
by
far
too
intent
upon
his
own
object
to
think
of
the
money
at
all
.
<EOS>
With
hasty
strides
he
ascended
the
dark
,
narrow
staircase
,
of
the
oldChequers
,
and
seeing
a
half
-
open
door
on
the
topmost
landing
,
he
pushedit
wide
open
,
and
entering
a
room
saw
Andrew

perfectlydressed

lying
in
a
deep
sleep
across

CHAPTER
CI.The
Search.—The
Assignation.—Britton
’s
Surprise
and
Exaltation
.
<EOS>
Learmont
stood
for
some
few
moments
gazing
on
the
bloated
swarthycountenance
of
the
smith
,
without
making
an
effort
to
awaken
him
fromhis
slumber
.
<EOS>
Dark
thoughts
chased
each
other
through
the
mind
of
thesquire
,
and
he
said
,
through
his
clenched
teeth,—“Sot!—Villain!—But
that
you
are
useful
to
me
still
<EOS>
,
I
would
strangleyou
as
there
you
lie
in
your
drunken
sleep
!
<EOS>
If
Jacob
Gray
was
dead
,
this
moment
should
be
your
last
,
Andrew
Britton
!
<EOS>
But
I
have
use
foryou
,
and
the
opportunity
which
now
occurs
,
may
never
occur
again
.
<EOS>
StillI
may
do
something
even
now
;
I
may
search
to
see
if
I
can
find
anypapers
or
documents
in
this
room
.
<EOS>
He
may
,
notwithstanding
my
suspicionsto
the
contrary
,
have
left
behind
him
some
record
of
the
crimes
he
hasbeen
engaged
<EOS>
in!”Learmont
walked
carefully
about
the
room
,
and
peered
into
everyprobable
place
,
in
the
expectation
of
being
repaid
by
some
discovery
ofimportance
to
his
interests
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
not
a
scrap
of
writing
inthe
chamber
that
he
could
discover
.
<EOS>
“Where
<EOS>
can
he
have
put
the
papers
he
always
boasted
of
having
foundupon
the
body
of
him
who
met
his
death
on
that
eventful
night
,
at
theold
Smithy
?
<EOS>
He
said
there
was
a
pocket
-
book
,
in
which
were
familydocuments
touching
me
very
nearly
;
and
Jacob
Gray
,
of
his
ownknowledge
,
confirmed
the
tale
,
regretting
the
while
that
his
own
fearswould
not
allow
him
to
rob
the
dead
of
those
important
papers
.
<EOS>
IfBritton
has
them
,
they
must
be
here
somewhere
.
<EOS>
”Eagerly
again
did
Learmont
examine
the
room
,
but
there
was
nothing
tobe
found
of
the
character
he
wished
,
and
he
was
fain
,
at
length
,
togive
up
the
search
in
despair
.
<EOS>
Then
he
half
-
drew
his
sword
and
thought
he
would
kill
Britton
,
but
asecond
thought
told
how
much
safer
he
might
do
so
on
some
of
his
visitsto
his
own
house
,
and
he
sheathed
his
sword
again
,
muttering,—“The
time
will
come
—
the
time
will
come
.
<EOS>
I
will
first
use
him
,
and
thenhe
shall
die
.
<EOS>
Now
to
awaken
this
slumbering
clod
.
”He
<EOS>
seized
Britton
by
the
collar
,
and
shook
him
very
roughly
,
crying,—“Britton
—
<EOS>
Andrew
Britton
,
awake!”“You
be
d
—
d
!
”
<EOS>
muttered
Britton
.
<EOS>
“
Ale
all
around
;
I
think
I
see
it
—
it’sa
lie!”“Andrew
Britton
awake
,
”
cried
Learmont
in
his
ear
.
<EOS>
“Con
—
con
—
confusion
to
Jacob
Gray
,
”
growled
Britton
.
<EOS>
“
Curse
everybody!”Learmont
now
shook
him
so
violently
that
he
opened
his
dull
heavy
eyesand
fixed
them
on
the
squire
’s
face
,
with
a
stare
of
such
astonishment
,
that
it
was
doubtful
to
Learmont
if
he
were
in
his
senses
or
not
.
<EOS>
“Do
<EOS>
you
know
me
,
Andrew
Britton
?
”
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
“I
should
think
so
,
”
said
Britton
.
<EOS>
“
It
’s
a
rum
dream
,
though
I
couldalmost
swear
I
was
awake
.
<EOS>
”“You
are
.
<EOS>
”“Am
<EOS>
I
?
<EOS>
That
’s
a
lie
.
”“Feel
<EOS>
my
hand
.
’
<EOS>
Tis
flesh
and
blood
.
<EOS>
”“You
<EOS>
—
you
do
n’t
mean
to
say
,
squire
,
that
you
are
here
,
”
cried
Britton
,
starting
from
the
bed
.
<EOS>
“
What
’s
the
matter
?
<EOS>
What
have
I
done?”“Nothing
;
but
I
wish
you
to
be
up
and
doing
.
<EOS>
I
have
discovered
theabode
of
Jacob
Gray
,
and
he
says
that
poor
silly
Britton
will
nevercope
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
says
that
Andrew
Britton
’s
muddle
head
is
only
fitfor
the
pillory
,
and
that
he
has
more
cunning
in
his
little
finger
<EOS>
thanyou
have
in
your
whole
composition
.
<EOS>
So
says
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
”“Now
curse
him
<EOS>
,
I
’ll
have
his
life
,
”
cried
Britton
.
<EOS>
“You
<EOS>
shall
,
if
you
will
be
guided
by
me
;
I
can
take
you
to
the
house
heis
in
;
I
can
make
you
sure
of
him
now
,
Britton
.
<EOS>
”“You
can
squire?”“I
can
.
<EOS>
”“Then
<EOS>
I
’m
your
man
—
drunk
,
or
sober
<EOS>
,
I
’ll
cut
Jacob
Gray
’s
throat
,
withpleasure
.
<EOS>
The
only
disagreeable
thing
will
be
that
when
he
’s
dead
,
onecan’t
taunt
him
about
it
.
”“It
<EOS>
will
be
revenge
enough
to
kill
him
,
”
said
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“
Will
you
beready
this
night?”“This
minute
if
you
like
.
<EOS>
”“No
<EOS>
—
it
must
be
at
midnight
—
we
must
be
very
careful
yet
,
for
Gray
iscunning
,
and
moreover
,
he
does
not
now
reside
in
a
lone
house
,
where
nocries
would
be
heard
.
<EOS>
He
lives
now
where
there
may
be
many
people
,
andit
would
detract
from
our
triumph
over
Gray
to
be
hanged
for
hismurder
.
”“It
<EOS>
would
rather
,
”
muttered
Britton
;
“
we
must
be
cunning
then
<EOS>
,
I
thinkI’m
quite
as
cunning
as
Gray
any
day
.
”“Be
<EOS>
guided
by
me
,
and
all
will
be
well
.
<EOS>
”“What
<EOS>
is
your
plan?”“That
you
meet
me
to
-
night
at
twelve
o’clock
,
and
bring
you
tools
toopen
locks
.
<EOS>
”“Yes
,
I
have
them
.
<EOS>
”“Then
we
will
make
our
way
to
Gray
’s
chamber
,
and
silently
,
ifpossible
,
kill
him
.
<EOS>
”“Silently
<EOS>
or
not
,
he
shall
die
;
but
where
is
the
young
scion
of—”“Hush
<EOS>
—
that

”“Now
promise
me

Britton
,
solemnly
,
that
you
will
drink
nothing
<EOS>
tillthis

is
concluded?”“Drink
nothing

<EOS>
Why

<EOS>
How
do

in

Why

he

said

“
He

”“By

Learmont

himself

as
he
descended

”“There

said
Britton
,
when
the

had
left
him

<EOS>
“He

the

a

”Meanwhile
<EOS>
Learmont
,
full
of
dark
thoughts
,
proceeded
slowly
down
thestaircase
until
he
reached
the
door
opening
into
the
passage
,
which
,
although
wide
open
when
he
passed
through
,
was
now
closed
;
and
on
theouter
side
was
the
back
of
mine
host
himself
,
who
was
supporting
hiscorporeal
substance
against
it
,
while
,
with
many
nourishes
andamplifications
of
his
arm
,
he
detailed
to
some
of
his
gossippingneighbours
how
grievously
he
had
been
cheated
,
by
a
tall
pale
man
in
acloak
,
out
of
a
flagon
of
the
best
wine
the
Chequers
could
afford
.
<EOS>
“My
masters
,
”
he
said
,
“
the
villain
had
an
odd
look

willunderstand

not
a

for

worth

Nowthere

preached
at

cried
the
landlord
,
to
whom
the
pleasure
oftelling
the
story
was
almost
an
indemnification
for
his
loss
.
<EOS>
“
As
I
wasa

I
was

<EOS>
this

Learmont
gave
the
door
so
vigorous
<EOS>
a
push
that
thelandlord
fell
forward
on
to
his
hands

knees
,
with
a
cry
of
wrath
,
as
he
supposed
some
one

the
cause

“Do

haughtily

to
his

<EOS>
“
You

<EOS>
”Learmont
<EOS>
took
from
his
pocket
a
piece
of
silver
,
and
threw
it
on
thefloor
;
then
,
drawing
his
cloak
tightly
round
him
,
he
stalked
from
thehouse
without
a
word
.
<EOS>
“Well

said
the
landlord
,
“

“Gracious

cried
Britton
,
suddenly
appearing
,
and
givingthe
landlord
a
knock
on
the
head
that
made
him
stagger
again
;
“
who

to
be
annoyed

<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
landlord
now
merely
cast
up
his
eyes
,
and
made
a
movement
with
hishands
,
as
much
as
to
signify
it
’s
no

bewise

then
hurried
into

to

<EOS>
When
Britton
entered
the
parlour
,
he
was
vociferously
welcomed
by
Bond

but
the
smith
beckoned
him
to
one
of
the
windows
,
and
when
the
bulkybutcher
obeyed
the
summons
,
Britton
whispered
in
his
ear:—“Bond

the
Murder

<EOS>
The
night
set
in
dark
and
lowering
,
and
heavy
masses
of
black
cloudspiled
themselves
up
in
the
southern
sky
long
before
the
hour
appointedby
Learmont
for
the
attempt
upon
the
life
of
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
A
cold
windswept
round
the
corner
of
the
streets
,
and
occasionally
a
dashingshower
of
rain
would
sweep
horizontally
along
for
a
moment
,
and
thencease
,
as
the
cloud
,
from
whence
sprang
the
shower
,
swept
onwards
onthe
wings
of
the
wind
through
the
realms
of
space
.
<EOS>
Many
of
the
lamps
were
extinguished
by
the
sudden
gusts
of
wind
,
andwatchmen
wisely
betook
themselves
to
their
various
boxes
,
comfortingtheir
consciences
with
the
conviction
that
no
decent
foot
-
pad
orhousebreaker
had
any
right
to
be
out
on
such
a
disagreeable
night
.
<EOS>
People
who
had
homes
to
go
to
,
and
warm
fire
-
sides
to
sit
down
by
,
andhappy
smiling
faces
to
welcome
them
,
hurried
through
the
streets
insearch
of
such
dear
enjoyments
,
while
the
poor
houseless
creatures
whohad
no
home
—
no
kind
kindred
,
no
friend
to
warm
the
heart
with
a
softcheering
smile
,
crept
into
old
doorways
and
covered
courts
,
andhalf
-
built
houses
,
huddling
themselves
up
with
a
shiver
,
to
try
by
theunconsciousness
of
sleep
to
forget
for
awhile
their
miseries
.
<EOS>
There
was
one
,
though
,
who
heeded
no
wind
nor
weather
—
one
to
whom
thecutting
blast
,
the
dashing
rain
,
and
the
general
discomfort
out
<EOS>
ofdoors
was
nothing
,
for
his
heart
and
brain
were
too
full
of
brighter
,
fairer
objects
to
allow
the
smallest
space
for
a
consideration
of
themore
external
face
of
nature
—
so
for
him
the
elements
might
wage
whatwar
they
liked
—
he
heeded
them
not
,
for
his
heart
was
crammed
with
firefrom
Heaven
,
and
the
sunshine
of
his
soul
made
its
own
beauty
in
hisbreast
.
<EOS>
That
one
was
Albert
Seyton
,
who
,
as
soon
as
the
shades
ofevening
had
made
it
safe
for
him
to
do
so
,
had
silently
and
cautiouslyensconced
himself
in
the
ancient
doorway
<EOS>
immediately
opposite
to
Gray’shouse
,
determining
there
to
watch
until
the
morning
’s
dawn
over
thehouse
,
which
he
fondly
believed
contained
his
dearly
-
beloved
,
lost
Ada
.
<EOS>
One
by
one
he
saw
the
lights
put
out
in
the
house
,
with
the
exceptionof
two
,
and
one
of
those
he
pleased
himself
by
imagining
lit
up
thechamber
of
Ada
.
<EOS>
Now
and
then
a
shadow
would
flit
across
the
blind
atthe
window
of
that
room
,
and
the
fond
lover
,
in
his
ardent
creativeimagination
,
endeavoured
to
trace
in
it
the
beauty
of
form
,
thesylph
-
like
symmetry
of
her
he
loved
.
<EOS>
“Yes
—
yes
,
”
he
said
,
“
she
is
there
,
my
beautiful
Ada
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
could
she
butguess
how
fond
,
how
true
a
heart
was
beating
for
her
here
.
<EOS>
How
vigilanta
sentinel
was
watching
lest
harm
should
come
to
her
through
the
longhours
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
Could
she
but
dream
of
much
—
were
some
kind
angel
towhisper
to
her
as
she
slept
that
her
lover
was
near
her
,
that
hewatched
over
,
and
blessed
her
as
she
slept
,
what
smiles
would
kindle
onher
face
,
what
flashing
tenderness
,
would
beam
from
her
,
and
what
anew
-
born
joy
would
spring
up
in
her
,
perhaps
,
heavy
heart
.
<EOS>
”Albert
crossed
his
arms
upon
his
breast
,
and
waited
more
than
an
hourwithout
the
least
interruption
,
and
then
,
just
as
the
only
other
lightin
the
house
,
besides
the
one
which
he
pleased
himself
by
fancyingburned
in
Ada
’s
chamber
,
was
put
out
,
and
the
entrance
to
the
deepdoorway
in
which
he
was
became
darkened
by
a
human
form
,
and
SirFrancis
Hartleton
’s
spy
stood
for
a
moment
or
two
muttering
to
himself
,
without
observing
Seyton
,
who
drew
back
silently
,
resolved
to
wait
afew
moments
to
see
if
he
intended
a
stay
or
not
.
<EOS>
“A
<EOS>
nice
night
,
”
muttered
the
man
.
<EOS>
“
I
think
I
see
myself
waiting
here
.
<EOS>
All
’s
right
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
If
I
come
once
an
hour
,
it
will
be
ample
timeenough
.
<EOS>
There
’s
a
gust
of
wind

<EOS>
It
’s
enough
to
make
a

marrowfeel
cold

<EOS>
”With
<EOS>
these
words
he
cast
another
look
up
at
the
house
inhabited
byGray
,
and
then
struck
off
to
a
public
-
house
,
which
was
at
the
corner
ofthe
street
.
<EOS>
“A
<EOS>
good
riddance
,
”
said
Albert
,
“
although
I
wonder
what
on
earth
he
canbe
watching
Gray
for

<EOS>
A
few
hours
though
must
end
all
my
suspense
<EOS>
andrestore
her
to

<EOS>
No
doubt
even
now
the

squire
is
maturing
someplan
to
aid
me
effectually
.
<EOS>
I
am
well
guided
by
his
wisdom
,
<EOS>
for
he
saystruly
that
Ada
would
never
be
perfectly
happy
without
knowing
whatthose
papers
contained
which
Gray
sets
such
store
by
,
and
any
rashattempt
to

Ada
might
involve
their
destruction

”The
<EOS>
light
which
Albert
Seyton
took
such
interest
in
came
from
JacobGray
’s
room
;
he
had
not
stirred
out
the
whole
of
the
day
,
and
thetempestuous
state
of
the
evening
induced
him
to
abandon
all
intentionof
leaving
his
home
.
<EOS>
About
sunset
he
had
crept
down
stairs
to
the
shop
,
and
desired
his
landlady
to
procure
him
some
refreshment
,
carefullylocking
his
room
door
even
for
the
few
moments
he
was
absent
from
it
inmaking
his
request
.
<EOS>
Then
,
when
he
returned
,
he
paced
to
and
fro
untilthe
viands
he
had
ordered
were
brought
to
him
,
when
,
with
an
attempt
ata
smile
,
he
said—“A

the
wind
howls
fearfully
.
<EOS>
”“Ah
<EOS>
,
you
are
right

said
the

;
“

started

<EOS>
sat
down
now

fixed
his
eyes
intently
on
the
cloak

between
thelining

outer

he
had
hidden
his

”The

deprived

Learmont
was
standing

like
a
statue
of
melancholy;in
his
own
chamber
,
and
he
heard
the
hour
from
the
clock
of
WestminsterAbbey
,
as
well
as
from
a
French
timepiece
in
his
room
,
which
,
as

indefiance
of

dark

bloody

that
ran
through

struck
up
one

With

Learmont
dashed

”CHAPTER
<EOS>
CIII.From
Twelve
to
One
.
<EOS>
Heedless
of
the
dashing
rain
which
ever
and
anon
came
in
soakingshowers
upon
the
wind
,
Learmont
paced
up
and
down
by
his
door
.
<EOS>
Neverbefore
had
he
made
up
his
mind
to
risk
so
much
by
one
act
as
he
wasabout
to
do
by
taking
the
life
of
Jacob
,
<EOS>
for
after
all
there
clung
tohim
like
a
shrieking
fiend
,
which
he
could
not
shake
off
,
the
horriblethought
the
confession
might
by
some
means
elude
his
search
,
and
sofall
into
the
hands
of
others
to
his
destruction
.
<EOS>
To
rid
himself
ofsuch
dire
forebodings
,
Learmont
was
in
no
state
as
regarded
the
powersof
reason
,
for
his
mind
was
so
wrought
upon
now
by
the
near
approach
<EOS>
ofthe
hour
of
action
he
had
waited
for
with
such
a
feverish
impatience
,
that
when
doubts
assailed
him
,
he
could
only
resist
them
by
mutteringhis
fixed
determination
that
Gray
should
die
,
and
that
upon
this
statehe
would
risk
all
.
<EOS>
Now
a
dark
heavy
figure
was
approaching
Learmont
<EOS>
’s
house
—
was
it
thesmith
?
<EOS>
The
squire
crept
up
his
own
steps
,
and
stood
in
the
shadow
ofhis
doorway
.
<EOS>
The
figure
came
on
.
<EOS>
It
was
—
yes
,
it
must
be
he!—Now
<EOS>
hepauses!—It
is
Britton!—He
has
kept
his
word
.
<EOS>
He
glances
aroundhim
—
mutters
a
malediction
—
and
ascends
the
steps
!
<EOS>
Then
Learmont
wentforward
to
meet
him
.
<EOS>
He
drew
a
long
breath
and
placing
his
tremblinghand
upon
the
smith
’s
shoulder
,
he
said,—“You
are
punctual
,
Britton
—
most
punctual
!
<EOS>
I
am
glad
to
see
you!!Welcome
<EOS>
—
welcome
!
<EOS>
What
have
you
there?”Britton
took
from
beneath
the
flap
of
his
coat
,
whither
he
had
hiddenit
,
a
large
bright
cleaver
,
and
holding
it
up
before
Learmont
<EOS>
’s
<EOS>
face
,
he
said
,
with
a
bitter
laugh,—“Will
that
do
,
squire
?
<EOS>
I
say
will
that
do?”“For
—
for
Gray?”“Yes
—
curses
on
him
!
<EOS>
I
think
this
will
make
sure
work
!
<EOS>
I
’ve
borrowed
iton
purpose
.
<EOS>
One
blow
with
it
,
and
Jacob
Gray
,
will
trouble
us
no
more!”“True
—
true
!
<EOS>
And
now
,
Britton
—
good
Britton
,
I
should
tell
you
that
thechild
of
him
who
lies
in
the
Old
Smithy
has
left
Gray
,
so
that
thereneed
not

the

scene
enacted
over
again
which
once
baulked

<EOS>
”“Left
<EOS>
him
,
squire
,
and
without
knowing?”“In
complete
ignorance
,
or
<EOS>
we
should
ere
this
have
heard
of
it
.
<EOS>
Ofthat
,
be
assured
,
for
I
am
quite
sure
,
Britton
,
where
we
are
goingto
-
night
,
there
is
nothing
to
apprehend
if
we
can
secure
Gray’sconfession

”“That

Come
—

and
they
walked
slowly
towards
Jacob
Gray
’s
<EOS>
mean
lodging
.
<EOS>
Learmont
spoke
not
as
they
went
,
but
now
and
then
Britton
,
when
hethought
of
Jacob
Gray
,
with
all
his
deep
cunning
,
being
circumvented
,
would
laugh
to
himself
,
and
striking
his
thigh
with
his
disengagedhand
,
would
mutter
,
with
the
accompaniment
of
some
fearful
oath
,
hisextreme
satisfaction
that
he
had
borrowed
the
cleaver
of
Bond
,
and
wasin
a
fair
way
of
trying
it
upon
the
skull
of
Gray
,
who
he
so
cordiallyhated
.
<EOS>
“Hush
—
hush
,
”
Learmont
said
,
as
they
neared
the
street
:
“
hush
,
Britton!We
must
be
cautious
,
for
to
all
appearance
the
house
in
which
Graylives
is
filled
with
inhabitants
.
<EOS>
Even
I
do
not
know
the
room
that
heinhabits
,
except
by
guess
,
and
that
the
guess
of
another
.
<EOS>
”“That
<EOS>
’s
awkward
,
”
said
Britton
:
<EOS>
“
but
we
’ll
have
him
,
squire
,
if
he
’s
<EOS>
inthe

<EOS>
If
I
have
to
go
from
room
to

,
smashing
somebody
ineach
,
I
’ll
have
Jacob
Gray
at
last!”“Hush
!
<EOS>
This
is
the
street
.
<EOS>
Have
you
the
means
of
opening
doors?”“I
have
.
<EOS>
Just
hold
the
cleaver
.
<EOS>
”Learmont
<EOS>
took
the
weapon
,
while
Britton
diving
his
hand
into
hispocket
,
produced
a
bunch
of
skeleton
keys
<EOS>
,
saying,—“I’ll
warrant
with
these
to
get
at
him
even
behind
fifty
locks
.
<EOS>
”“Then
understand
me
clearly
,
”
said
Learmont
,
in
a
low
,
husky
voice
;
“
Ihave
arms
about
me
should
they
be
required
;
but
you
shall
take
Gray’slife
while
I
secure
you
from
all
interruption
by
keeping
guard
at
thedoor

<EOS>
Whatever
money
is
found
you
shall
possess
yourself
of

while
Itake
possession
of
the
confession
,
which
must
,
surely
,
if
at
all
inexistence
,
come
easily
to
hand
.
<EOS>
See
here
,
I
have
a
light
.
<EOS>
”Learmont
<EOS>
produced
from
his
pocket
a
small
lantern
as
he
spoke
,
andshowed
Britton
that
when
he
drew
the
slide
he
could
cast
a
strong
rayof
light
upon
any
object
.
<EOS>
“Very
<EOS>
well
,
the
money
is
of
more
use
to
me
than
the
confession
;
becauseyou
know
,
squire
,
I
can
confess
myself
whenever
I
’ve
a
mind
that
way
.
<EOS>
”“True
<EOS>
—
true
,
that
is
the
house
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Britton
,
we
must
be
firm
,
and
byall
the
powers
of
hell
<EOS>
,
I
swear
that
,
let
who
will
interrupt
me
thisnight
shall
meet
his
death

”“Oh
,
that
’s
the
house
,
is
it
?
”
<EOS>
said
Britton
,
<EOS>
as
beckoned
by
Learmont
,
he
stood
with
him
on
the
verge
of
the
narrow
pavement
and
glared
up
atit
.
<EOS>
“There
is
but
one
light
,
”
whispered
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“And
<EOS>
that
,
”
said
the
smith
,
“
I
’d
wager
<EOS>
a
thousand
pounds
comes
fromGray
’s
room
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
long
ago
,
when
we
had
some
talk
,
that
he
nevercould
bear
to
be
without
a
light
.
<EOS>
”“’Tis
<EOS>
more
than
probable
.
<EOS>
The
keys
—
the
keys
!
<EOS>
Ha
,
what
was
that?”It
appeared
to
Learmont
as
if
a
footstep
had
sounded
on
the
oppositeside
of
the
way
,
but
upon
hastily
turning
,
all
was
still
,
and
he
couldsee
no
one
.
<EOS>
His
ears
,
however
,
had
not
deceived
him
;
for
Albert
Seyton
,
when
he
saw
two
figures
pause
opposite
to
Gray
’s
house
,
had
steppedforward
,
intending
,
by
walking
past
them
,
to
ascertain
,
if
possible
,
who
they
were
,
and
had
recognised
the
squire
as
soon
as
he
had
emergedfrom
the
deep
doorway
where
he
held
his
solitary
watch
.
<EOS>
For
one
instantonly
Albert
paused
,
and
then
recollecting
his
solemn
promise
not
tointerfere
in
the
business
until
the
time
appointed
,
he
shrunk
backagain
,
convinced
in
his
own
mind
that
Learmont
was
adopting
some
safeand
<EOS>
sure
means
of
rescuing
his
Ada
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
he
might
even
see
her
broughtfrom
the
house
under
the
protection
of
his
generous
friend
.
<EOS>
Could
hethen
keep
from
rushing
to
her
side
?
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
He
felt
that
then
he
could
not;but
now
was
not
the
time
.
<EOS>
He
shrunk
far
back
into
the
passage
,
but
kepthis
eyes
fixed
with
a
painful
and
absorbing
interest
upon
theproceedings
of
Learmont
and
his
companion
.
<EOS>
Then
the
smith
took
Learmont
’s
lantern
,
and
after
carefully
examiningthe
lock
of
the
outer
door
,
he
took
from
among
the
keys
he
carried
onewhich
in
a
moment
turned
it
.
<EOS>
Still
,
however
,
the
door
resisted
allattempts
to
open
it
,
and
Britton
whispered
to
Learmont
that
there
was
abar
.
<EOS>
“What
are
we
to
do
?
”
<EOS>
gasped
the
squire
.
<EOS>
“Pull
it
off
,
”
said
the
smith
;
“
but
wait
a
minute
.
<EOS>
”As
<EOS>
he
spoke
he
made
a
great
rummaging
in
one
of
his
capacious
pockets
,
and
then
producing
a
flat
case
bottle
,
which
was
capable
,
upon
amoderate
computation
,
of
holding
about
a
pint
and
a
half
,
he
uncorkedit
,
and
placing
it
to
his
lips
,
took
a
hearty
draught
of
the
contents
.
<EOS>
“Now
,
by
hell
,
”
muttered
Learmont
,
“
can
not
you
go
on
without
drink
,
andif
<EOS>
so
,
why
stop
at
such
a
juncture
as
this?”“Go
to
the
devil
!
”
<EOS>
said
Britten
.
<EOS>
“
Here

it

<EOS>
no

you
any
.
<EOS>
Now
,
I
’m
ready
again;give
me
the
cleaver
.
<EOS>
”Britton
<EOS>
took
the
cleaver
,
and
by
great
pressure
succeeded
in
insertingits
blade
partially
between
the
door
and
the
joint
;
then
he
gave
it
asudden
wrench
,
and
with
a
sound
that
went
to
the
heart
of
Learmont
andfilled
him
with
alarm
,
a
wooden
bar
,
with
which
the
door
had
been
madefast
,
fell
into
the
shop
,
being
forced
from
its
place
by
the
wrenchgiven
by
the
cleaver
.
<EOS>
“You
will
ruin
all
by
your
haste
and
want
of
caution
,
”
muttered
thesquire
;
“
some
one
is
sure
to
be
alarmed
by
that
noise
.
<EOS>
”“That
<EOS>
’s
just
what
I
intend
,
”
said
Britton
.
<EOS>
“
Whoever
comes
,
we
can
askthem
for
a
certainty
where
Gray
is
.
<EOS>
”“Such
<EOS>
a
scheme
would
be
madness
,
”
said
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“
Britton
you
will
ruinall
.
<EOS>
”“Come
<EOS>
in
,
”
said
the
smith
,
and
grasping
Learmont
by
the
arm
,
he
draggedhim
into
the
little
shop
,
and
closing
the
door
after
them
as
well
as
hecould
.
<EOS>
All
was
utter
darkness
,
and
for
a
moment
or
two
,
Learmont
stoodlistening
painfully
to
hear
if
the
bar
had
created
any
alarm
,
or
hadpassed
off
without
notice
.
<EOS>
Then
,
to
his
horror
,
he
heard
a
footstep
insome
room
contiguous
to
where
they
were
;
a
gleam
of
light
shot
fromunder
a
door
,
and
just
as
Learmont
with
a
deep
groan
strode
towards
theouter
door
to
leave
the
place
,
believing
that
the
house
must
bethoroughly
alarmed
,
Britton
,
in
a
whisper
said,—“Stoop
down
,
squire
,
and
leave
me
to
manage
it
.
<EOS>
”Learmont
<EOS>
mechanically
obeyed
him
.
<EOS>
The
door
from
whence
the
gleam
oflight
had
issued
,
opened
,
and
the
woman
of
the
house
entered
the
shop
.
<EOS>
“There
<EOS>
’s
that
bar
down
again
,
I
declare
,
”
she
said
.
<EOS>
“
It
’s
always
aslipping
down
,
just
as
I
am
going
to
bed
too
.
<EOS>
”A
<EOS>
faint
scream
burst
from
her
lips
as
Britton
suddenly
placed
his
handover
her
mouth
,
<EOS>
saying—“Make
any
noise
,
and
I
’ll
smash
your
brains
out
.
<EOS>
Be
quiet
and
I
won’t
.
<EOS>
”Terror
then
kept
the
woman
from
screaming
,
and
when
Britton
releasedher
,
she
sank
upon
her
knees
,
with
the
candle
she
carried
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
“Mercy
—
mercy
,
sir
,
”
she
faltered
.
<EOS>
“
Oh
,
have
mercy
.
<EOS>
”“Hush
,
”
said
Britton
.
<EOS>
“
How
many
people
are
in
this
house?”“Three
—
three
—
sir
,
your
worship
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Spare
my
life
.
”“Do
<EOS>
you
see
this
?
”
<EOS>
said
the
smith
,
holding
the
cleaver
within
an
inchof
her
face
.
<EOS>
“Yes
—
yes
—
yes
,
”
gasped
the
terrified
woman
.
<EOS>
“Very
<EOS>
well
,
then
,
if
you
do
n’t
answer
truly
all
I
ask
of
you
,
andremain
quite
quiet
for
the
next

I
’ll
dash

be

<EOS>
”“Oh

sir
—

<EOS>
I
’m
a
poor
lone
woman
.
<EOS>
Spare

.
”“Answer
<EOS>
then
,
who
else
is
in
the
house
besides
you?”“Poor
old
Mrs.
Garnett
,
sir
,
and
—
and
—
Master
Gray
,
sir
—
if
you
please

sir

”“Humph

<EOS>
And
where
does
Master
Gray
sleep?”“In
—
in

the
three

,
sir
.
<EOS>
”“Very
<EOS>
good

<EOS>
Now
,
my
good
woman
,
I
shall
just
tie
you
up
when
I’verefreshed
myself
a
little
.
<EOS>
”Then
<EOS>
with
a
nod
at
the
woman
,
and
a
wink
,
towards
Learmont
,
who
wascrouching
behind
a
pile
of
baskets
,
Britton
took
another
draught
fromhis
case
bottle
,
a
process
which
he
seemed
resolved
upon
repeating
atevery
stage
of
the
business
he
had
in
hand
.
<EOS>
He
then
took
the
light
from
the
woman
’s
trembling
hand
,
and
seizing
herby
the
hand
,
he
pushed
her
into
the
room
from
whence
<EOS>
she
had
come
,
andin
a
few
moments
tied
her
securely
to
the
post
of
a
bed
which
was
there
.
<EOS>
“Now
,
if
you
so
much
as
mutter
a
word
,
or
attempt
to
make
any
alarmtill
I
see
you
again

he
said
“
you
know
what
you
have
to
expect

<EOS>
Lookat
this
cleaver

<EOS>
”“I

<EOS>
”“Good

<EOS>
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
Another
word
,
and—”Britton
made
a
fearful
demonstration
with
the
cleaver
<EOS>
round
the
head
ofthe
terrified
woman
,
and
then
went
back
to
the
shop
,
where
Learmont
wasstanding
,
looking
awfully
pale
,
and
his
eyes
emitting
an
unnaturalbrilliance
from
the
great
excitement
under
which
he
was
labouring
.
<EOS>
“What
<EOS>
do
you
think
of
that
,
squire
,
”
whispered
the
smith
.
<EOS>
“
D
—
n
him

he
’s
in
the
three

and
nobody

<EOS>
Nowthat
’s
<EOS>
what
I
call
pleasant

<EOS>
There
’s
only
two
women
in
the
house

<EOS>
Oh

won’t
I
have
some
fun
with
Master
Jacob

<EOS>
Cunning
Master
Gray,—Ha

<EOS>
Ha!Ha

<EOS>
Artful

Jacob

<EOS>
”“’Tis
<EOS>
well

”
said
Learmont
,
“
as
it
has
turned
out
;
but
you
run
greatrisks
.
<EOS>
Let
us
secure
the
door
now

<EOS>
”“I
can
lock
it
,
”
said
Britton
,
as
he
did
so
.
<EOS>
“
Now
we
are
all
right

squire

<EOS>
How
cunning
Gray
is

and
what
a

Britton
is

<EOS>
A

We

<EOS>
”“Now
,
Britton
,
let
me
implore
you
to
drink
no
more
.
<EOS>
Wait
,
at
least
,
until
our
enterprise
is
concluded

<EOS>
”“Why
,
it
’s
only
brandy
,
squire
.
<EOS>
It
’s
cooling
and
pleasant
<EOS>
when
one
’s
atwork

<EOS>
I
used
to
drink
it
at
the
old
smithy
till
I
made
the

”“We

succeed
—
we
must
,
surely
,
succeed

”
said
Learmont
,
as
Brittonholding
the
candle
above
his
head
,
glanced
around
him
a
moment
<EOS>
and
thensaid,—“Here
is
the
staircase
:
<EOS>
it
’s
at
the
top
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Come
on

squire
—
come
on

<EOS>
”They
ascended
the
staircase
slowly
on
their
awful
errand
;
and
,
oh
!
<EOS>
Whata
whirl
-
wind
of
dark
passions
filled
the
heart
of
Learmont
!
<EOS>
Fear
,
rage
<EOS>
,
hate
—
<EOS>
all
were
struggling
for
pre
-
eminence
;
and
now
that
he
was
so
nearthe
accomplishment
of
his
much
cherished
scheme
of
vengeance
upon
JacobGray
for
the
horrible
uneasiness
he
had
made
him
suffer
for
so
manyyears
,
his
mental
suffering
was
probably
greater
,
because
augmented
bythe
most
intense
anxiety
,
than
ever
it
had
yet
been
.
<EOS>
The
stairs
creaked
beneath
their
footsteps
,
and
the
wind
blew
about
theflame
of
the
candle
,
making
the
shadows
of
themselves
,
and
of
thebalustrades
,
dance
in
wild
disorder
upon
the
walls
.
<EOS>
Then
the
stormwithout
appeared
to
have
increased
,
for
the
rumble
of
distant
thundercame
upon
their
ears
;
and
,
as
they
reached
a
narrow
window
on
thestaircase
,
a
bewildering
flash
of
lightning
for
an

lit

CHAPTER
CIV.The
Murder
.
<EOS>
Did
any
perception
of
his
great
danger
haunt
the
brains
of
Jacob
Grayas
he
slept
in
his
miserable
abode
?
<EOS>
Did
the
shadow
of
the
grave
restupon
his
soul
?
<EOS>
Was
there
no
fiend
to
whisper
in
his
ear
suspicions
,
andto
aggravate
his
suffering
by
the
horrors
of
imagination
?
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
AlthoughGray
slept
—
although
the
corporeal
part
of
him
was
still
—
the
mind
knewno
repose
.
<EOS>
The
sweet
oblivion
of
sleep
was
not
for
him
,
and
as
he
sat
,
with
his
head
leaning
upon
the
table
,
deep
moans
,
and
now
and
then
agasping
sob
,
like
that
of
some
drowning
wretch
who
sees
the
watersclosing
above
his
head
,
and
shutting
out
the
last
glimpse
of
hope
withthe
last
glimpse
of
light
,
burst
from
his
labouring
breast
.
<EOS>
Busy
fancywas
carrying
him
on
its
airy
pinions
from
earliest
infancy
through
allthe
chequered
scenes
of
chicanery
and
crime
.
<EOS>
From
the
happy
stainlesshours
of
childhood
he
wandered
in
thought
through
every
scene
ofrobbery
,
of
murder
,
of
pain
,
terror
,
and
despair
which
he
had
acted
inand
endured
.
<EOS>
Again
he
rushed
from
the
burning
ruins
of
the
smithy
,
withthe
child
of
the
dead
in
his
arms
;
again
he
was
hunted
from
house
tohouse
by
the
squire
and
by
Britton
;
then
followed
his
denouncement
atCharing
-
cross
by
Ada
,
and
his
wild
run
up
the
Strand
—
the
murder
ofVaughan
—
his
own
danger
as
he
tremblingly
crossed
the
roof
-
tops
—
hisagony
in
the
field
near
Hampstead
—
his
hunger
—
his
pain
,
misery
,
destitution
,
and
wretchedness
—
all
were
enacted
over
again
in
frightfuldistinctness
,
and
Jacob
Gray
could
not
awake
.
<EOS>
The
perspiration
,
coldand
clammy
,
stood
upon
his
brow
in
bead
-
like
drops
;
he
tried
to
shriek
,
but
his
tongue
clove
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
—
he
tried
to
struggle
,
buthis
limbs
were
powerless
.
<EOS>
The
man
of
crime
was
dying
a
thousand
deathsin
his
deep
,
mental
agony
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
slowly
approached
his
executioners
.
<EOS>
Step
by
step
up
thecreaking
staircase
<EOS>
they
came
—
the
smith
,
with
a
dogged
resolution
,
andhis
bloated
face
inflamed
with
passion
and
the
quantity
of
raw
spiritshe
had
already
drunk
.
<EOS>
Learmont
followed
him
,
twining
his
arm
round
thecrazy
balustrade
of
the
staircase
to
steady
himself
as
he
proceeded
onhis
awful
errand
.
<EOS>
Now
they
had
reached
the
second
landing
and
theflight
of
stairs
leading
to
the
floor
on
which
was
Jacob
Gray
’s
roompresented
themselves
,
steep
and
narrow
,
winding
into
dimness
andobscurity
,
and
scarcely
permitting
more
than
one
person
to
ascend
themat
once
.
<EOS>
The
smith
did
not
speak
,
but
he
pointed
up
the
stairs
,
and
then
,
with
agrim
smile
,
held
up
the
cleaver
threateningly
.
<EOS>
“On
,
on
,
”
whispered
Learmont
<EOS>
;
“
let
it
be
done
quickly
now
—
this
suspenseis
terrible
.
<EOS>
”“Take
<EOS>
a
little
of
this
,
”
said
Britton
,
producing
the
brandy
;
<EOS>
“
it
willwarm
you
;
for
you
tremble
as
if
you
had
got
the
ague
,
”
and
Learmont
,
inhis
heart
,
felt
thankful
for
the
offer
.
<EOS>
He
took
the
bottle
with
atrembling
hand
,
and
drunk
deep
of
the
contents
.
<EOS>
He
might
as
well
havedrunk
as
much
water
,
for
,
in
his
present
state
of
mind
,
the
ardentspirit
had
no
power
over
him
,
nor
could
any
artificial
excitement
equalthe
fearful
one
which
possessed
him
already
.
<EOS>
Britton
himself
took
a
draught
from
the
bottle
,
and
then
placed
it
in
acorner
by
the
staircase
,
as
of
no
further
,
use
,
being
empty
,
andwithout
another
word
he
commenced
the
ascent
of
the
attic
staircase
.
<EOS>
Learmont
followed
him
closely
,
and
,
when
they
were
half
way
up
,
he
laidhis
hand
upon
Britton
’s
arm
,
and
said
,
in
a
whisper
that
sounded
likethe
hissing
of
a
snake,—“Britton
,
Britton
—
<EOS>
kill
him
—
at
once
—
do
not
delay
—
kill
him
at
once
.
<EOS>
”“What
?
<EOS>
”
muttered
Britton
,
“
and
scarcely
let
him
know
<EOS>
that
there
arepeople
as
cunning
as
himself
.
<EOS>
If
I
do
kill
him
at
once
,
may
I
be—”“Hush
,
hush
<EOS>
—
remember
that
we
must
secure
the
confession
.
<EOS>
Without
that
,
we
are
but
forging
a
bolt
for
our
own
destruction
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
had
bettersee
him
first
myself
.
<EOS>
”“That
<EOS>
you
may
do
as
you
like
,
squire
,
but
give
me
the
pleasure
of
usingthis
cleaver
on
his
skull
when
I
please
.
<EOS>
”“You
<EOS>
shall
,
you
shall
—
<EOS>
I
will
see
him
first
,
and
,
by
practising
upon
hisfears
endeavour
to
procure
his
confession
from
him
by
a
quicker
meansthan
searching
for
it
.
<EOS>
Go
on
,
Britton
—
go
on
.
<EOS>
Should
his
door
be
locked
,
you
can
open
it
;
and
do
you
keep
guard
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
whileI
enter
his
room
.
<EOS>
”“As
<EOS>
you
please
,
squire
.
<EOS>
First
or
last
,
I
care
not
,
so
as
I
’m
in
at
thedeath
,
and
have
a
few
minutes
talk
with
my
old
friend
,
Jacob
,
first
.
<EOS>
”“Hush

<EOS>
We
are

<EOS>
See
ye
not
yon
streak
of
light
from
beneaththat
door

<EOS>
It
must
be
his
chamber
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Britton
,
now
—
remember
if
he
beawake
,
he
must
die
at
once
,
for
the
opening
of
the
door
will
alarm
him
,
and
he
may
raise
some
cry
that
may
bring
help
;
but
if
I
succeed
inentering
his
room
without
his
knowledge
,
do
you
wait
,
and
when
you
hearme
utter
the
words

The

do
you
enter

whispered
Britton
;
“
it’sall
the
better
,
for
it
will
deaden
the
sound
of
unlocking
the
door
.
<EOS>
”With
<EOS>
the
slightest
possible
noise
consistent
with
the
performance
ofthe
operation
at
all
<EOS>
,
Britton
unlocked
Gray
’s
door
.
<EOS>
A
faint
lightissued
from
the
room
.
<EOS>
Learmont
paused
a
moment
,
and
pressed
his
hand
tightly
upon
hisbreast
—
then
placing
his
finger
on
his
lips
,
and
waving
his
hand
toBritton
,
he
glided
into
Jacob
Gray
’s
apartment
.
<EOS>
The
door
slowly
shut
to
within
an
inch
or
less
—
all
was
as
still
as
thegrave
.
<EOS>
The
candle
shed
but
a
faint
light
,
for
Gray
had
been
asleep
longenough
to
allow
the
snuff
to
grow
gigantic
.
<EOS>
In
a
moment
Learmont
sawGray
sleeping
in
the
uneasy
position
he
had
chosen
,
and
he
stood
withhis
feelings
wrought
up
to
the
highest
pitch
of
excitement
,
gazing
uponhis
victim
.
<EOS>
Soon
a
low
moan
came
from
Gray
,
and
he
muttered
the
words,—“Oh
,
God
—
oh
,
God!”—in
such
awful
wailing
accents
,
that
even
Learmontfelt
sick
at
heart
to
hear
them
.
<EOS>
“I
must
awaken
him
,
”
he
whispered
,
“
I
must
—
not
delay
.
<EOS>
”Thrice
<EOS>
did
Learmont
try
to
raise
his
voice
to
awaken
Jacob
Gray
,
andthrice
did
his
tongue
refuse
its
office
,
producing
but
a
faint
whisper
,
which
failed
in
its
purpose
.
<EOS>
Then
,
as
if
a
ton
of
lead
had
beenappended
to
each
foot
,
Learmont
crept
towards
the
table
and
stretchedout
his
hand
.
<EOS>
The
long
white
fingers
shook
like
leaves
agitated
by
thewind
—
his
heart
beat
with
fearful
violence
—
his
lips
were
drawn
back
witha
painful
spasm
from
his
teeth
—
he
breathed
short
and
hurriedly
;
theeffort
to
lay
his
hand
upon
the
sleeping
man
was
great
,
and
it
was
morethan
<EOS>
a
minute
ere
he
could
do
so
.
<EOS>
Then
nearer
,
nearer
,
still
he
crept
,
and
by
a
desperate
effort
he
touched
his
shoulder
,
as
in
a
hollow
,
spectral
voice
he
said—“Awake
,
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
”One
<EOS>
cry
escaped
Gray
’s
lips
as
he
lifted
his
head
,
and
that
cry
seemedto
arouse
<EOS>
Learmont
from
his
lethargy
,
for
he
seized
Gray
by
the
throatand
<EOS>
held
him
as
with
a
face
distorted
by
excitement
,
he
said
,
“
Anothercry
,
and
it
is
your
last
,
Jacob
Gray
.
”“Learmont
,
”
gasped
Gray
,
and
then
they
glared
into
each
other
’s
faceslike
two
spirits
of
evil
,
conscious
of
the
other
’s
power
,
yet
preparedfor
some
awful
straggle
for
life
or
death
.
<EOS>
Gray
put
up
his
hands
and
held
Learmont
’s
arm
,
while
he
shook
the
chairon
which
he
sat
by
his
trembling
,
and
thus
in
awful
silence
did
thesetwo
men
regard
each
other
for
more
than
a
minute
,
each
enduring
mentalagony
,
such
only
as
the
wicked
are
doomed
to
suffer
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
awfulpicture
—
ghastly
and
dreadful
to
imagine
—
a
scene
to
haunt
the
brain
insleep
,
and
people
vacancy
with
horror
.
<EOS>
The
dim
spectral
-
looking
light
,
lighting
up
the
distorted
features
of
these
two
men
,
whose
souls
seemedto
be
concentrated
in
their
dilated
eye
-
balls
,
as
they
glared
at
eachother
with
the
fixedness
of
marble
statues
.
<EOS>
Then
there
was
the
hugebulky
form
of
the
smith
,
at
the
crevice
of
the
door
,
which
he
hadenlarged
to
allow
himself
a
view
of
what
was
passing
in
the
room
,
withthe
bright
shining
instrument
of
death
clutched
in
his
grasp
,
andgloating
over
the
prospect
of
the
blood
which
was
to
be
shed
—
thecrushed
bones
and
the
mangled
flesh
<EOS>
he
was
to
exult
over
—
the
prayersfor
mercy
choked
in
gore
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
it
was
horrible!Learmont
<EOS>
was
the
first
to
speak
,
and
when
he
did
so
,
his
voice
washoarse
,
and
for
want
of
breath
<EOS>
his
words
came
strangely
disjointed
fromhis
lips
.
<EOS>
“The
confession
—
the
confession
—
the
confession
,
”
he
said
.
<EOS>
Then
Gray
seemed
to
feel
that
death
was
at
hand
,
and
he
slid
from
thechair
on
his
knees
,
crying,—“Mercy
—
mercy
—
mercy
.
”“Hush
,
”
said
Learmont
,
dwelling
upon
the
word
till
it
became
a
longhissing
sound
.
<EOS>
“
Hush
!
<EOS>
The
confession
—
the
confession
.
<EOS>
Speak
above
yourbreath
and
you
die
—
the
confession
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
still
kept
his
grasp
of
Gray
,
and
shook
him
to
and
fro
as
much
fromhis
own
nervousness
as
from
design
.
<EOS>
It
was
awful
then
to
hear
Jacob
Gray
,
in
a
husky
whisper
,
pleading
forhis
life
—
praying
for
that
mercy
he
had
never
himself
shown
,
andappealing
to
feelings
which
had
no
existence
in
the
breasts
of
eitherLearmont
or
himself
.
<EOS>
“Spare
me
<EOS>
—
spare
me
,
”
he
said
,
“
<EOS>
and
I
will
go
far
away
from
you
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
spare
my
life
,
and
that
mercy
you
now
show
to
me
will
plead
with
Heavenfor
you
,
while
I
have
no
such
hope
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
spare
me

<EOS>
”“The
confession
—
the
confession
.
<EOS>
”“You
will
kill

—

will
kill
me
if
I
give
it
to

<EOS>
Oh

<EOS>
”“The
confession
—
the

”
was
Learmont
’s
only
reply
.
<EOS>
Gray
then
wrung
his
hands
and
wept
hysterically
,
and
Learmont
let
gohis
hold
of
him
,
for
he
saw
he
was
incapable
of
resistance
.
<EOS>
“God
help

he
said

<EOS>
“
You

grovelled
as
the
feet

Learmont

—
he
sobbed

wept

prayed

implored

<EOS>
He
crawled
after
him
as
the
squire
shrunk
back
;
he
seized
him
byhis
cloak
,
and
when
that
was
wrenched
from
his
hands
,
he
clasped
themabove
his
head
,
and
with
an
awful
spasmodic
action
of
the
throat
hekept
repeating
the
one
word,—“Mercy
!
<EOS>
Mercy
!
<EOS>
Mercy!”Learmont
was
getting
each
moment
more
and
more
enraged
at
Gray’spertinacity
in
refusing
him
the
confession
,
and
he
made
one
last
effortto
induce
him
to
produce
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
“Give

”“We
will

said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
My
cloak
—
God
bless
you
,
squire!—Wewill
go
together!—My
cloak
—
My
cloak!”Learmont
shook
his
clenched
hand
,
and
uttering
an
awful
curse
,
headded,—“The
hour
has
come!”In
a
moment
,
Andrew
Britton
stood
before
the
terrified
gaze
of
Gray
,
who
seemed
perfectly
paralysed
with
terror
,
for
although
his
lipsmoved
,
he
uttered
no
sound
,
but
stretching
his
arms
out
before
him
,
asif
to
keep
off
the
smith
,
he
still
knelt
in
the
room
where
Learmont
hadleft
him
.
<EOS>
The
smith
stepped
up
close
to
the
horror
-
stricken
man
,
and
then
hissides
shook
with
demoniac
mirth
as
he
said—“Ho

Ho

<EOS>
”Gray
appeared
from
the
moment
of
Britton
’s
entrance
to
give
himself
upfor
lost
.
<EOS>
With
one
gasping
sob
he
let
his
head
sink
on
his
breast
,
andthe
only
sign
of
life
he
gave
was
in
the
nervous
twitching
of
hisfingers
which
played
with
each
other
convulsively
.
<EOS>
Britton
then
stepped
up
to
him
,
and
producing
the
cleaver
from
behindhis
back
,
he
held
it
close
to
Jacob
Gray
’s
face
,
<EOS>
saying—“Artful
Jacob
,
what
do
you
think
of
that
?
<EOS>
Look
at
it
—
it
is
sharp

fancy
it
crashing
through
your

then

even
then

”“Oh

suddenly

made
a

purposely
,
so
near
Jacob
Gray’sface
,
that
it
passed
only
within
a
hair

excitedhis

terror

a
scream
burst
from

up

”Learmont
,
during
this
awful
conference
,
was
busy
about
the
room
layinghis
trembling
hands
upon
everything
with
a
hope
of
finding
theconfession
of
Gray
,
and
each
moment
as
his
search
was
unproductive
,
hebecame
more
dreadfully
anxious
and
excited
,
until
his
very
brain
seemedon
fire

<EOS>
“The

he
said
,
turning
to

“
Give

”“Not

came
close
up
to
him

and
laying
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder
,
he
said,—“Jacob

Gray

<EOS>
“

<EOS>
Gray
spoke
,
he
crept
towards
the
window
;
a
wild
hope
had
occurred
tohim

that
he
might
open
it
suddenly

dash
out
into

escape

to
him
.
<EOS>
“One

moment

said
Gray
.
<EOS>
“
Spare
me

<EOS>
”Gray
<EOS>
then
suddenly
pushed
a
chair
between
himself
and
Britton
and
fledto
the
window
.
<EOS>
Learmont
turned
his
eyes
away
as
he
saw
Britton
stepover
the
obstruction
with
the
cleaver
uplifted

<EOS>
Scream
after
screamburst
from
Jacob
Gray
as
he
stood
with
the
back
of
his
head
against
thewindow

<EOS>
There
was
an
awful
crashing
sound
,
one
gurgling
shriek
,
and
a
noise
ofbroken
glass
.
<EOS>
“Kill
him
—
kill
him
,
”
<EOS>
gasped
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“
Keep
him
not
in
agony!”The
cleaver
descended
again
,
a
heavy
fall
succeeded
,
and
then
all
wasstill
.
<EOS>
Something
cold
fell
on
the
back
of
Learmont
’s
hand
.
<EOS>
A
glancetold
him
<EOS>
it
was
blood
;
but
before
he
could
utter
the
cry
of
horror
thatrose
upon
his
lips

a
tremendous

CHAPTER
CV.After
the
Murder
.
<EOS>
The
knocking
continued
without
intermission
for
several
seconds
,
andeach
blow
seemed
to
Learmont
as
if
it
was
struck
upon
his
own
heart
.
<EOS>
“Britton
,
Britton
,
”
he
cried
,
“
you
hear
.
<EOS>
There
is
some
alarm
.
<EOS>
Hasten
,
hasten
,
or
we
are
lost
.
<EOS>
”Britton
turned
his
excited
face
towards
the
squire
,
and
the
dim
lightof
the
candle
fell
upon
it
,
<EOS>
Learmont
could
not
but
be
struck
by
itsawful
expression
.
<EOS>
The
smith
had
at
length
succeeded
in
gratifying
thelong
cherished
desire
of
his
heart
,
namely
,
to
be
in
some
dreadfulmanner
revenged
upon
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
Wild
excitement
had
caused
him
to
dothe
deed
which
he
had
just
committed
,
and
every
evil
passion
of
hisnature
was
peeping
forth
like
a
bold
fiend
from
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
Crimson
spots
of
human
gore
were
likewise
upon
his
face
—
horribleevidences
of
the
work
he
had
been
about
.
<EOS>
“Who
knocks
?
”
<EOS>
he
said
in
a
low
,
earnest
voice
.
<EOS>
“
Who
is
mad
enough
tointerfere
with
me?”He
raised
in
his
hand
the
cleaver
as
he
spoke
—
with
a
dull
heavy
splashthere
fell
from
its
blade
on
to
the
floor
“
gouts
of
blood
,
”
<EOS>
andLearmont
turned
away
his
head
,
sickened
at
the
sight
.
<EOS>
“Who
dares
,
I
say
,
to
interfere
with
me
?
”
repeated
Britton
.
<EOS>
“
Squire
,
Jacob
Gray
wo
n’t
trouble
you
any
more
.
<EOS>
”“Name
<EOS>
him
not
<EOS>
—
oh
,
name
him
not
,
”
said
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“
Hark
—
hark!”As
he
spoke
,
it
appeared
that
whoever
had
been
knocking
at
the
outerdoor
of
the
house
had
grown
impatient
,
and
burst
it
open
,
frailly
as
ithad
been
fastened
after
the
violence
that
had
been
used
towards
it
byBritton
,
for
there
was
heard
a
loud
crash
,
and
then
a
sound
of
rapidfootsteps
approaching
.
<EOS>
“Flight
—
flight
,
”
gasped
Learmont
,
as
he
sprung
towards
the
door
.
<EOS>
“Flight
be
d
<EOS>
—
d
,
”
said
Britton
,
as
he
flourished
the
cleaver
above
hishead
.
<EOS>
“
I
’m
not
going
to
be
scared
now
because
some
one
is
coming
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
then
walked
deliberately
to
Gray
’s
cloak
,
in
which
it
will
berecollected
the
confession
was
concealed
,
and
wiped
the
reeking
bladeof
the
instrument
,
by
which
he
had
put
Gray
to
death
,
upon
it
.
<EOS>
“For
<EOS>
my
sake
,
and
your
own
,
”
said
Learmont
,
“
leave
this
room
.
<EOS>
Whatenemy
to
us
can
he
be
who
is
coming
,
unless
we
make
him
one?”As
<EOS>
he
spoke
,
he
seized
the
reluctant
smith
by
the
arm
,
and
dragging
himacross
the
narrow
landing
pushed
open
another
doorway
on
the
samestory
,
and
entered
an
empty
room
.
<EOS>
Now
that
the
savage
smith
had
dipped
his
hands
in
Gray
’s
blood
,
hewould
,
with
wild
ferocity
,
have
defied
the
world
;
and
it
would
havegiven
him
far
greater
pleasure
to
have
been
hindered
in
his
retreat
,
and
to
have
had
to
fight
his
way
out
of
the
house
,
with
Bond
’s
cleaver
,
than
to
escape
easily
and
without
a
struggle
.
<EOS>
In
order
now
to
explain
the
cause
of
the
violent
knocking
at
soterrible
a
moment
at
the
door
,
we
must
carry
the
reader
back
for
abrief
space
to
Albert
Seyton
and
his
lonely
walk
.
<EOS>
Filled
with
surprise
,
as
we
know
he
was
,
to
see
the
squire
at
such
an
hour
making
aclandestine
entrance
into
the
house
in
which
Gray
resided
,
he
remainedupon
the
tip
-
toe
of
expectation
waiting
his
re
-
appearance
,
accompaniedby
Ada
,
in
which
case
he
felt
that
he
could
no
longer
restrain
hisimpatience
,
but
must
fly
across
to
her
,
and
welcome
her
to
freedom
,
even
if
it
cost
him
the
reproach
of
breaking
his
word
,
and
his
futurefriendship
of
the
rich
squire
.
<EOS>
But
as
minute
after
minute
passed
languidly
away
,
and
no
re
-
appearancelook
place
,
Albert
’s
impatience
and
anxiety
became
excruciating
,
and
hecould
no
longer
stay
within
the
deep
doorway
,
but
scarcely
knowing
whathe
did
,
he
walked
to
the
very
middle
of
the
road
,
and
keeping
his
eyesfixed
upon
the
door
,
with
but
now
and
then
an
occasional
glance
at
thewindow
,
which
he
had
all
along
pleased
himself
with
the
idea
was
<EOS>
thatof
Ada
’s
room
,
he
trembled
again
with
impatient
excitement
.
<EOS>
The
profound
stillness
of
everything
surprised
him
,
and
more
than
oncehe
was
almost
tempted
to
believe
he
must
have
been
dreaming
,
when
hesupposed
he
saw
Learmont
enter
the
house
at
all
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
however
,
thesilence
was
broken
by
a
loud
crash
at
the
windows
,
and
,
by
the
dim
anduncertain
light
<EOS>
,
Albert
saw
some
object
apparently
dashed
through
theglass
,
and
then
withdrawn
again
.
<EOS>
That
object
was
the
head
of
Jacob
Gray
,
<EOS>
for
then
had
Britten
given
himhis
death
blow
in
the
manner
we
have
recorded
.
<EOS>
Excited
as
he
was
,
this
maddened
Albert
,
and
the
idea
seizing
him
thatAda
must
be
in
some
danger
,
he
,
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
,
knockedloudly
at
the
door
and
finally
with
one
vigorous
rush
against
it
,
burstit
open
,
and
fell
himself
into
the
shop
.
<EOS>
It
was
some
moments
before
,
in
the
dark
,
he
could
find
the
staircase;but
,
<EOS>
when
he
did
,
he
ascended
it
as
rapidly
as
he
could
,
resolved
whenhe
reached
the
top
,
to
make
himself
known
by
his
voice
.
<EOS>
“Ada
—
Ada
,
”
he
cried
in
a
tone
that
rang
through
the
house
,
and
fellwith
a
disagreeable
chill
upon
the
heart
of
Learmont
,
who
immediatelyrecognised
in
it
the
voice
of
Albert
,
and
could
not
divine
how
at
sucha
moment
,
he
should
happen
to
be
at
hand
.
<EOS>
“Ada
—
Ada
,
”
again
cried
Albert
,
and
then
Learmont
laid
his
hands
on
thesmith
’s
arm
,
and
whispered—“Britton
,
<EOS>
there
is
but
one
man
there
,
let
us
kill
him
and
escape
.
<EOS>
”“I’m
<EOS>
willing
but
<EOS>
where
is
Master
Jacob
’s
money
,
and
his
confession
,
Ishould
like
to
know?”“The
money
I
will
make
good
to
you
,
and
I
am
quite
convinced
of
what
Ialways
suspected
,
that
there
is
no
confession
but
what
lay
in
Gray’sown
brain
.
<EOS>
”“Then
it
do
n’t
lay
in
his
brain
now
,
”
said
Britton
,
“
I
’ll
be
sworn
.
<EOS>
”“Hush
—
come
on
.
<EOS>
”“Ada
—
Ada
<EOS>
,
”
cried
Albert
,
pausing
on
the
staircase
,
with
the
hope
ofhearing
some
answering
sound
,
and
more
alarmed
at
the
dead
silencewhich
prevailed
in
the
house
,
than
had
he
encountered
noise
,
tumult
,
and
evident
danger
.
<EOS>
“What
the
devil
is
he
shouting
in
that
way
for
?
”
<EOS>
muttered
Britton
.
<EOS>
“Hush
—
hush
,
”
said
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“
Some
cursed
chance
has
brought
him
here
.
<EOS>
Let
us
descend
,
and
,
as
you
pass
him
,
Britton
—
you
understand
me?”“I
do
,
“
said
Britton
.
<EOS>
“
Come
on
,
then
.
<EOS>
Where
’s
your
light
.
<EOS>
”“We
<EOS>
need
none
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
be
seen
by
him
.
<EOS>
What
you
have
to
do
,
you
caneasily
do
in
the
dark
—
kill
him
or
maim
him
.
<EOS>
I
care
not
which
.
<EOS>
”“Well
<EOS>
,
squire
,
”
muttered
Britton
,
“
you
certainly
do
leave
me
all
thework
to
do
:
but
when
one
’s
hands
in
,
it
ai
n’t
much
matter
.
<EOS>
”Albert
,
in
the
excitement
of
his
feelings
,
when
he
got
as
high
as
thesecond
floor
,
paused
,
uncertain
whether
or
not
he
had
arrived
on
alevel
with
the
room
of
which
the
window
had
been
broken
so
violently
,
and
he
stood
for
several
minutes
calling
upon
Ada
,
his
voice
,
each
timethat
he
uttered
her
name
,
betraying
the
great
anxiety
which
he
labouredunder
,
and
which
was
momentarily
increasing
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
then
,
a
voice
answered
him
faintly
,
and
guided
by
the
sound
,
Albert
pushed
against
a
door
,
which
,
yielding
to
his
touch
,
presented
adark
room
,
into
which
he
stepped
,
saying,—“Whoever
<EOS>
you
are
here
,
for
Heaven
’s
sake
,
<EOS>
let
me
have
a
light

”“Oh
,
spare
a
poor
old
creature
,
who
has
n’t
long
to
live

”
said
a
voice
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
intend
you
no
harm
,
”
said
Albert
,
“
but
for
God
’s
sake
get
me
alight
.
<EOS>
”There
was
a
great
creaking
of
an
old
crazy
bedstead
,
and
then
the
voicesaid
,
in
the
tremulous
accents
of
old
age,—“Are
you
the
man
that
lives
up
stairs?”“No
,
no
,
”
said
Albert
,
“
but
get
a
light
quickly
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
old
woman
,
after
stumbling
over
every
article
of
furniture
in
herroom
,
at
length
found
a
tinder
-
box
,
and
commenced
striking
a
light
witha
particularly
small
bit
of
flint
,
which
,
produced
,
upon
an
average
,
one
spark
to
every
half
dozen
blows
.
<EOS>
Albert
Seyton
,
in
his
impatience
,
little
suspected
that
the
verycircumstance
of
the
old
woman
not
being
able
to
get
him
a
light
quicklysaved
his
life
,
for
while
she
was
endeavouring
to
procure
one
,
Learmontand
Britton
were
creeping
down
the
staircase
with
the
expectation
ofmeeting
Albert
and
taking
his
life
.
<EOS>
As
they
passed
the
door
of
the
room
in
which
Seyton
was
,
and
heard
thehacking
of
the
flint
and
steel
,
Britton
muttered,—“There
’s
some
one
getting
a

squire

<EOS>
We
may
as
well
move
on

orshall
I
go

no

said
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“
I

<EOS>
Come

<EOS>
”They
passed
the
door
,
and
Albert
was
saved
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
moments
more
theold
woman
procured
a
light
,
and
then
peering
at
Albert
from
her
deepsunken
eyes
,
she
said,—“And
who
may
you
be
,
<EOS>
young
gentleman

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
”“Ask
no
questions
<EOS>
,
”
cried
Albert
,
as
he
took
the
light
from
her
,
“
<EOS>
buton
your
soul
,
tell
me
,
in
which
room
of
this
house
resides
a
younggirl
,
by

,
Ada?”The
old
woman
was
alarmed
at
his
vehemence
,
and
tremblingly
muttered
,
that
she
did
not
know
who
he
meant
,
for
there
was
no
such
person
to
herknowledge
there

<EOS>
“One
<EOS>
Gray

here

”
<EOS>
said
Albert
.
<EOS>
“Oh
,
yes
,
”
said
the
woman
,
“
I
’ve
heard
there
’s
a
Mr.
Gray
up
stairs
.
<EOS>
”Albert
waited
not
another
moment
,
but
bounded
up
the
staircase
with
thelight
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
“Ada
—
Ada
.
’
<EOS>
Tis
I
—
Albert
,
”
he
said
,
as
he
reached
the
top
landing
.
<EOS>
The
echoes
of
the
old
house
were
the
only
sounds
that
replied
to
him
,
and
shading
the
light
with
his
hand
,
he
walked
into
Jacob
Gray
’s
room
,
the
door
of
which
was
partially
open
.
<EOS>
Everything
appeared
in
confusion
,
and
the
first
article
that
Albert
trod
upon
was
the
cloak
,
which
hadfallen
from
its
hook
at
the
back
of
the
door
.
<EOS>
A
feeling
of
awe
creptover
him
,
which
he
could
not
account
for
.
<EOS>
His
blood
seemed
to
creepthrough
his
veins
,
and
there
was
an
anxious
flutter
at
his
heart
,
as
heagain
,
but
in
a
lower
tone
,
pronounced
the
name
of
Ada
.
<EOS>
All
was
silent
as
the
grave
.
<EOS>
Albert
stood
a
few
paces
only
within
thedoorway
,
and
his
heart
misgave
him
,
that
something
dreadful
must
havehappened
to
her
he
loved
.
<EOS>
“Ada
—
Ada
!
”
<EOS>
he
cried
,
wildly
.
<EOS>
“
If
you
live
,
speak
—
Gray
—
Learmont
?
<EOS>
Whereare
you
all

<EOS>
Am

Ada

<EOS>
Where

felt
something
soft
and
slimy
under
his
feet
.
<EOS>
He
stooped
with
thelight
—
deadly
sickness
came
over
him
—
for
a
moment
all
objects
swambefore
his
eyes
;
he
was
compelled
to
hold
the
back
of
the
chair
forsupport
—
he
was
standing
in
a
pool
of
coagulated
blood!How
long
<EOS>
it
was
then
before
he
recovered
full
consciousness
<EOS>
he
knewnot
,
but
gradually
his
perceptions
returned
,
and
then
he
shrieked
thename
of
Ada
,
with
a
tone
of
anguish
,
that
would
have
saddened
anyheart

and
lingered
in
the
ears
for
months
like
a
death
shriek

<EOS>
“They

My

reeled
further
into
the
room
,
and
when
he
had
passed
the
bed
,
whichpartially
concealed
the
window
<EOS>
he
stood
like
one
suddenly
transformedto
stone
;
for
there
lying
in
a
ghastly
heap
,
in
a
pool
of
blood
,
thefeatures
horribly
disfigured
,
and
scarcely
a
trace
of
the
upper
portionof
the
skull
visible
,
his
eyes
fell
upon
what
once
was
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
All
his
air
-
drawn
schemes
—
his
deep
resolves
—
his
cunning
—
his
cruelty
—
hisavarice
,
and
his
ambition
—
where
were
they
now
?
<EOS>
What
had
he
reaped
asthe
reward
of
his
great
selfishness
?
<EOS>
A
death
of
horror
.
<EOS>
May
Heaven
havemercy
on
his
soul
.
<EOS>
Albert
Seyton
felt
like
one
fascinated
by
the
hideous
glare
of
aserpent
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
withdraw
his
eyes
from
the
ghastly
spectacle
formany
minutes
,
and
while
he
so
gazed
,
his
very
heart
seemed
to
shrinkwithin
him
,
and
a
feeling
of
horror
crept
up
—
up
to
his
brain
,
till
aclammy
perspiration
broke
out
upon
his
brow
,
and
hung
there
in
heavydrops
,
while
each
breath
he
drew
,
was
laboured
and
heavy
.
<EOS>
It
was
frightful
,
but
by
the
crushing
blow
of
the
cleaver
,
one
ofGray
’s
eyes
had
been
forced
from
its
socket
<EOS>
—
it
hung
by
a
bleedingfilament
—
round
—
glassy
and
fixed
—
it
seemed
to
glare
upon
Albert
like
athing
of
life
—
he
could
almost
fancy
it
moved
.
<EOS>
The
young
man
covered
hiseyes
with
his
disengaged
hand
,
as
he
said,—“This
must
be
a
dream
—
God
of
heaven
,
this
can
not
be
real
—
<EOS>
when
oh
,
whenshall
I
awake?”Distinct
sounds
,
as
of
many
voices
,
now
suddenly
came
upon
his
ears
,
and
he
started
,
as
if
the
tones
of
a
human
voice
had
removed
some
spellfrom
off
his
faculties
.
<EOS>
Louder
and
louder
the
sound
came
upon
his
ears
.
<EOS>
There
were
evidently
several
voices
.
<EOS>
Then
he
heard
a
confused
tramplingof
feet
—
heavy
footsteps
were
approaching
.
<EOS>
“Thank
God
,
”
said
Albert
,
with
a
feeling
of
inexpressible
relief
,
as
hefelt
sure
now
that
some
human
beings
besides
himself
were
at
hand
.
<EOS>
Hewithdrew
himself
with
difficulty
,
from
the
awful
-
spectacle
in
Gray’sroom
,
and
proceeding
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
<EOS>
,
he
said,—“Help
—
help
—
murder
—
murder
—
murder

”CHAPTER
<EOS>
CVI.The
Arrest
.
<EOS>
The
sound
of
his
own
voice
seemed
now
to
conquer
all
the
nervousfeelings
which
had
oppressed
him
,
and
Albert
Seyton
continued
shoutingfor
aid
,
until
lights
flashed
up
the
narrow
staircase
,
and
severalvoices
cried,—“Hilloa
there
,
<EOS>
what
’s
the
matter?”“Murder
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Albert
.
<EOS>
“
Quick
,
here

<EOS>
There
has
been
murder
done
—
thisway
—
quick
,
whoever
you
are

<EOS>
”Several
men
now
made
their
appearance
on
the
stairs
,
and
in
a
fewmoments
the
landing
was
crowded
with
a
party
bearing
lights
,
some
ofwhom
were
likewise
armed
.
<EOS>
“This
way
,
”
said
Albert
,
pointing
to
the
door
of
Gray
<EOS>
’s
room
;
“
a
manhas
been
barbarously
murdered
—
his
corpse
lies
there
.
”“Oh
!
<EOS>
It
’s
you
,
my
spark
,
is
it
?
”
<EOS>
cried
a
man
stepping
up
to
Albert
,
whoat
a
glance
he
recognised
as
the
spy
,
upon
Jacob
Gray
,
who
had
causedhim
so
much
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
“For
<EOS>
God
’s
sake

”
cried
Albert
,
“
forget
all
but
the
necessity
ofsecuring
the
perpetrators

horrible

<EOS>
A

<EOS>
”“Very

said
the

he
took
a

<EOS>
”Another
<EOS>
officer
who
had
gone
into
Gray
<EOS>
’s
room
now
came
with
a
face
aspale
as
a
sheet

and
trembling
in
every
limb
.
<EOS>
“It

he
cried
,
“
I
never

Albert

some

”“It

said
the
spy
,
“

<EOS>
”All
<EOS>
but
one
constable
,
who
kept
a
firm
hold
of
Albert
,
went
into
theroom
,
but
hardened
as
these
men
were
to
scenes
of
terror
,
a
cry
ofunmingled
horror
escaped
them
as
they
saw
the
ghastly
spectacle
underthe
window
,
and
they
quickly
retreated
to
the
landing
again
.
<EOS>
“You
<EOS>
see
I
have
spoken
the
truth

cried
Albert
;
“

the

”“I

<EOS>
cried
Albert
,
the
dreadful
circumstances
of
suspicion
in
which
hewas
placed
for
the
first
time
darting
across
his
mind
,
for
in
theexcitement
of
his

<EOS>
he
had
scarcely
noticed
what
was
saidbefore

<EOS>
“
I

<EOS>
Why

—
I
did

<EOS>
”“The

remarked
the
spy

“
comrades

this
willbe
no

I
can
give
evidence
that
this

has
been
dogging
the
man
who
is
murdered
for
some
days
past
.
<EOS>
Here
we
find
him
actually
in
the
very
room
,
or
on
the
very
threshold
ofit

<EOS>
It
was
a
lucky
job
we
happened
to

the
door
wide

camein

<EOS>
”“A

said
another
.
<EOS>
“There
’s
been
many
a

hung
on
half
the

”
remarked
a
third
.
<EOS>
Albert
looked
from
one
to
the
other
for
a
few
moments
,
perfectlybewildered
at
this
new
turn
things
had
taken
;
then
he
said,—“You
do
not

you
can
not
suspect
me

”“Hear

cried
the
spy
;
“

will
own
to
it
all
in
a
minute

”“Unhand
<EOS>
me
,

cried
Albert
;
“
I
am
as
innocent
of
this
awful
crime
as
youyourselves

<EOS>
I—”He
struggled
to
free
himself
from
the
grasp
of
the
officer
,
but
acouple
more
of
them
immediately
closed
with
him
,
and
in
a
few
momentshe
found
himself
handcuffed
and
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
“One
of
you
stay
,
”
cried
the
spy
,
“
and
do
n’t
let
any
one
come
near
thebody
.
<EOS>
By
Heaven
,
this
is
as
ugly
a
job
as
ever
<EOS>
I
heard
of!”Albert
clasped
his
manacled
hands
together
,
and
a
feeling
of
despaircame
over
his
heart
—
a
prison
—
a
scaffold
,
and
an
ignominious
deathseemed
to
be
staring
him
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
How
was
he
to
extricate
himselffrom
the
fearful
circumstances
by
which
he
was
now
surrounded
?
<EOS>
Wherenow
were
all
his
fond
hopes
of
once
more
seeing
his
Ada
?
<EOS>
The
rush
ofwretched
feelings
across
his
mind
was
almost
too
great
for
mortalendurance
,
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
stern
,
unpitying
men
by
whom
hewas
now
surrounded
,
he
could
have
shed
tears
in
the
bitterness
of
hisdespair
.
<EOS>
“Take
me
where
you
like
,
”
he
cried
.
<EOS>
“
Do
with
me
what
you
like
—
accuse
meof
what
you
please
—
<EOS>
but
,
as
you
are
men
and
Christians
,
search
thishouse
<EOS>
,
I
implore
you
,
for
a
young
maiden
,
whose
name
is
Ada
.
<EOS>
She
mustbe
here
somewhere
.
<EOS>
I
entreat
you
to
search
for
her
—
I
implore
you
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
there
are
papers
in
the
room
,
most
probably
,
of
yon
murderedman
,
which
are
directed
to
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
.
<EOS>
Find
them
,
and
takethem

Then
do
with
me
what
you
please
,
and
in
my
heart
I
believethe
kindest
hand
would
be
that
which
took
my
life
.
<EOS>
”The
accent
in
which
these
words
were
uttered
was
so
despairing
—
<EOS>
so
fullof
exquisite
grief
and
abandonment
of
all
hope
,
that
even
the
officers
,
blunted
as
their
feelings
were
,
looked
affected
by
what
they
heard
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
moment
’s
silence
<EOS>
and
then
one
said,—“Bring
him
along
at
once
before
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
He
never
minds
beingknocked
up
on
real
business
.
<EOS>
”“But
<EOS>
you
will
do
what
I
ask
you
,
”
said
Albert
;
<EOS>
“
you
will
search
for
herI
have
mentioned
to
you?”“We
can
not
,
”
was
the
reply
;
“
we
must
lose
no
time
—
come
on
—
come
on
.
<EOS>
”With
<EOS>
a
deep
sigh
Albert
dropped
his
head
upon
his
breast
,
and
sufferedhimself
to
be
led
down
the
staircase
in
a
state
of
great
dejection
.
<EOS>
When
he
reached
the
foot
of
the
topmost
flight
,
he
summoned
all
hisenergies
,
and
once
more
cried,—“Ada
,
Ada!”Echo
only
answered
him
.
<EOS>
The
officers
paused
themselves
involuntarily
to
listen
if
any
voiceresponded
to
Albert
’s
frantic
call
,
but
when
all
was
still
again
,
theyurged
him
forward
,
saying,—“We
can
wait
no
longer
—
come
to
themagistrate’s
.
<EOS>
”“Once
<EOS>
more
hear
me
,
”
cried
Albert
;
“
some
of
you
must
have
hearts
tofeel
for
the
unfortunate
.
<EOS>
Here
,
I
swear
to
you
that
there
are
papers
inyon
room
,
where
lies
the
ghastly
remains
of
the
murdered
man
,
which
itmuch
imports
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
to
have

<EOS>
Oh
,
search
for
them
—
search
,
I
pray
you
—
I
will
attempt
no
escape
.
<EOS>
You
shall
find
me
patient
—
mostpatient
;
but
as
you
love
justice
,
find
those
papers
.
<EOS>
”The
vehemence
and
earnestness
of
his
tone
was
not
without
its
effecteven
upon
those
rude
men
,
and
they
looked
in
each
other
’s
faces
for
amoment
or
two
,
irresolute
,
when
something
came
down
the
staircase
witha
rustling
sound
,
and
the
man
who
had
been
left
above
to
keep
guard
onthe
door
of
the
room
,
called
to
his
companions
below
,
saying—“Ask
the
prisoner
if
that
’s
his
cloak
—
it
was
lying
half
in
and
half
outof
the
door
way
.
<EOS>
”One
<EOS>
of
the
officers
lifted
the
cloak
,
from
the
floor
,
and
turning
toAlbert
said—“Is
this
yours?”“No
,
”
replied
Albert
,
“
it
must
be
his
who
lies
above
in
death
.
<EOS>
It
isnot
mine
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
more
than
suspect
it
is
,
though

”
said
the
officer
,
as
he
held
hislight
close
to
it
,
“
why
it
is
smeared
with
blood
.
<EOS>
We
must
take
thiswith
us
,
comrades
.
<EOS>
It
’s
a
dainty
piece
of
evidence
against
theprisoner
.
<EOS>
Come
on

there
has
n’t
been
such
a
famous
murder
as
this

Vaughan

killed
in

Strand

<EOS>
”“But
<EOS>
the
papers
.
<EOS>
You
forget
the
papers
,
”
cried
Albert
.
<EOS>
“Hang
the
papers
<EOS>
,
”
was
the
reply
.
<EOS>
“
There
are
none
.
<EOS>
We
can
not
waste
timewith
you
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
unhappy
young
man
resigned
himself
to
his
fate
,
and
accompanied
theofficers
in
silence
.
<EOS>
Evil
fortune
seemed
to
be
expending
all
her
maliceagainst
him
;
a
tide
of
circumstantial
evidence
was
rushing
over
himmore
than
sufficient
to
overwhelm
him
in
the
consequences
of
a
crime
ofwhich
he
was
innocent
,
Ada
appeared
lost
to
him
for
ever
now
that
Graywas
dead
;
for
what
clue
had
he
to
find
her
now
;
and
the
conduct
ofLearmont
was
mysterious
,
if
he
were
not
the
actual
murderer
of
JacobGray
.
<EOS>
A
confused
whirl
of
thoughts
and
conjectures
passed
through
thebrain
of
Albert
with
frightful
rapidity
.
<EOS>
The
strange
and
mostunexpected
events
of
the
night
were
completely
bewildering
.
<EOS>
At
onemoment
he
thought
of
accusing
Learmont
of
the
murder
;
at
another
healmost
doubted
if
he
was
correct
in
fancying
he
had
seen
the
squire
atall
—
so
strangely
disjointed
—
so
full
of
mystery
—
<EOS>
so
redolent
of
horrorhad
been
the
night
’s
proceedings
,
that
the
unfortunate
Albert
couldscarcely
be
said
to
be
in
a
sufficiently
collected
frame
of
mind
toform
a
just
conclusion
,
or
hazard
a
practicable
conjecture
respectingthem
.
<EOS>
His
brain
seemed
to
grow
into
fire
with
the
agony
he
endured
,
andmore
like
one
dead
than
alive
,
he
was
passively
led
by
the
officerstowards
the
residence
of
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
to
be
there
accused
ofthe
awful
crime
of
murder
.
<EOS>
As
the
party
neared
the
house
of
the
magistrate
,
a
feeling
of
utterdespair
crept
over
Albert
’s
heart
,
and
he
was
conscious
but
of
onethought
;
that
was
,
that
he
would
be
glad
when
he
was
dead
,
for
then
allhis
miseries
would
be
over
,
and
he
should
perhaps
in
some
happierstate
,
see
Ada
,
who
,
with
an
awful
shudder
,
he
thought
must
have
beenmurdered
long
since
by

<EOS>
Situated
as
Albert
Seytonnow
was
,
even
hope
<EOS>
was
a
stranger
to
his
heart
<EOS>
—
he
could
see
not
one
rayof
sunlight
amid
the
dreary
gloom
by
which
he
was
immured
—
all
was
blankdespair
.
<EOS>
Like
some
wave
-
tossed
mariner
,
who
,
after
struggling
with
theremorseless
seas
for
a
long
dreary
night
,
looks
with
lack
-
lustre
eyealong
the
world
of
waters
as
the
first
streak
of
the
morning
lightenables
him
to
do
so
,
and
sees
no
hope
—
no
distant
land
—
no
sail
,
andfeels
that
to
struggle
longer
is
but
to
protract
death
which
iscertain
,
Albert
gave
way
to
the
circumstances
by
which
he
wassurrounded
,
and
as
he
entered
the
magistrate
’s
house
,
the
expression
ofdeep
dejection
on
his
countenance
was
remarked
with
significantwhispers
and
glances
by
the
officers
,
who
looked
upon
it
as
a
sign
ofconscious
guilt
,
and
entertained
no
more
doubt
of
the
fate
of
theirprisoner
,
than
they
did
of
their
own
existence
,
so
confident
were
theythat
he
was
,
in
truth
,
the
murderer
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
could
he
have
guessed
at
that
moment
,
that
he
was
under
the
sameroof
with
his
Ada
—
could
he
have
dreamt
that
he
was
breathing
the
sameair
which
she
breathed
—
what
bursts
of
glorious
sunshine
through
themurkiest
sky
that
ever
frowned
upon
the
world
,
could
,
in
its
contrast
,
have
equalled
the
feelings
that
would
have
possessed
his
breast
,
inlieu
of
the
twin
hags
grief
and
despair
,
which
now
possessed
it
wholly
.
<EOS>
And
Ada
—
the
beautiful
and
good
—
the
pure
of
heart
—
the
noble
—
the
giftedAda
—
she
was
sleeping
,
all
unconscious
of
the
events
of
that
fearfulnight
;
little
imagined
she
,
that
her
great
enemy
had
died
so
awfully
,
or
that
he
who
loved
her
lived
in
such
great
jeopardy
.
<EOS>
The
morning
was
rapidly
approaching
now
,
and
Albert
was
taken
into
aroom
facing
the
east
,
in
the
residence
of
Sir
Francis
,
and
closelyguarded
,
until
the
magistrate
should
make
his
appearance
,
which
,
in
afew
moments
he
did
,
having
been
awakened
with
the
news
that
a
barbarousmurder
was
committed
and
the
criminal
was
in
his
house
.
<EOS>
Albert
stood
facing
the
window
,
and
it
was
partly
the
dull
reflectionof
the
early
morning
light
,
and
partly
the
death
-
like
paleness
of
hisface
,
from
the
state
of
mind
<EOS>
he
was
in
,
which
made
him
look
more
like
acorpse
than
a
living
man
,
and
for
a
moment
prevented
Sir
Francis
fromrecognising
him
.
<EOS>
Albert
flinched
not
from
the
magistrate
’s
earnest
gaze
,
but
lookingsteadily
at
him
,
he
said,—“Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
I
am
brought
here
accused
of
murder
—
<EOS>
I
aminnocent
,
but
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
more
—
do
with
me
what
you
will
,

amtired
of

”“Mr

<EOS>
Seyton
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
“The
same
,
”
said
Albert—“the
unhappy
Seyton
.
<EOS>
”Sir
<EOS>
Francis
remained
a
moment
or
two
in
deep
thought
,
then
he
said:—“Officers
what
is
the
charge
against
this
young
man?”“Murder
,
your
worship
,
”
replied
one
.
<EOS>
“Leave
<EOS>
the
room
,
all
of
you
,
I
will
hear
the
evidence
one
by
one
.
”“Oh
,
sir
,
”
said
Albert
,
“
there
is
evidence
enough
—
fate
has
marked
mefor
destruction
.
<EOS>
You
may
send
me
now
to
prison
,
and
spare
your
labour
—
<EOS>
Iam
innocent
,
but
yet
submit
;
you
see
I
am
patient

sir

<EOS>
”“You
speak
from
the
bitterness
of
your
heart
,
”
said
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
“
I
amhere
to
do
my

without

<EOS>
My

<EOS>
Now

me
hearwhat

<EOS>
”Sir
<EOS>
Francis
himself
swore
the
officer
,
who
remained
in
the
room
<EOS>
,
andwho
was
the
principal
spy
upon
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
“Your
worship
,
”
he
said
,
“
is
aware
that
my
duty
has
been
to
keep
watchon
a
man
named
Gray
.
”“Which
<EOS>
duty
you
must
have

said
the
magistrate

<EOS>
“I
beg
your

<EOS>
”“What
<EOS>
do
you
mean?”“He
is
dead
.
”“Dead
—
Gray
dead
?
<EOS>
It
surely
is
not
his
murder
—
but
go
on
—
go
on
.
<EOS>
”Sir
<EOS>
Francis
reclined
back
in
his
chair
,
and
partially
shaded
his
facewith
his
hand
while
the
officer
proceeded
in
his
narrative
.
<EOS>
“It
was
nearly
half
-
past
one
o’clock
,
your
worship
,
when
,
upon
passingthe
door
of
the
house
where
this
man
Gray
lived
,
I
saw
it
open
,
andupon
examination
,
saw
that
it
had
been
forced
by
some
one
.
<EOS>
Not
knowingthen
how
many
persons
might
be
there
,
I
ran
to
the
round
-
house
inBuckingham
-
street
,
and
got
assistance
,
then
I
and
several
officers
,
with
lights
,
entered
the
house
.
<EOS>
The
first
thing
we
heard
was
themoaning
of
a
woman
,
who
we
found
tied
to
a
bedstead
in
the
roomadjoining
the
shop
,
and
immediately
after
,
we
proceeded
up
stairs
<EOS>
,
whenwe
heard
the
prisoner
calling
out
to
some
one—”“Who
<EOS>
did
he
call
to?”“The
name
was
Ada
.
<EOS>
When
we
got
to
the
top
of
the
house
,
we
found
theprisoner
on
the
landing
,
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
,
and
upon
goinginto
the
first
room
we
came
to
,
there
lay
murdered
,
and
dreadfullymangled
,
the
man
Gray
—
your
worship
had
told
me
to
watch
.
<EOS>
”“He
was
quite
dead?”“Quite
,
your
worship
—
we
picked
up
this
cloak
stained
with
blood
,
whichwe
believe
belongs
to
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
”“That
<EOS>
is
all
you
have
to
say?”“It
is
,
your
worship
,
except
that
the
prisoner
has
been
dodging
Grayabout
as
closely
as
I
have
,
for
a
day
or
two
now
.
”“Do
<EOS>
you
wish
to
ask
any
questions
of
this
witness
?
”
<EOS>
said
Sir
Francis
toAlbert
,
in
a
cold
tone
.
<EOS>
“None
,
”
said
Albert
.
<EOS>
“
He
has
spoken
the
truth
,
and
yet
I
am
innocent
.
<EOS>
”“What
<EOS>
further
evidence
is
there
?
”
said
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
“The
other
officers
can
swear
to
what
I
have
said
,
your
worship
,
”
saidthe
officer
,
“
and
I
have
left
one
to
see
that
no
one
meddles
with
thebody
.
<EOS>
”“That
was
right
,
”
cried
Sir
Francis
,
with
sudden
animation
.
<EOS>
“
I
will
gothere
myself
at
once
.
<EOS>
There
may
be
some
papers
.
<EOS>
”Albert
immediately
spoke
in
a
tone
of
such
deep
emotion
that
SirFrancis
paused
as
he
rose
from
his
chair
,
and
listened
to
him
with
aninterest
and
a
growing
doubt
of
his
guilty
connexion
with
Learmont
,
that
it
would
have
given
him
the
sincerest
pleasure
to
verify
.
<EOS>
“Sir
,
”
said
Albert
,
“
I
implore
you
for
the
sake
of
one
for
whom
I
havesuffered
much
—
one
who
I
have
loved
,
who
I
still
love
more
fondly
—
morefervently
than
I
love
life
itself
,
to
search
for
the
packet
which
longago
<EOS>
I
told
you
was
directed
to
yourself
.
<EOS>
How
Jacob
Gray
came
by
hisdeath
as
I
hope
for
God
’s
mercy
<EOS>
I
know
not
.
<EOS>
”“Know
not
!
”
said
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
Then
turning
to
the
officer
he
said,“Wait
without
,
”
and
in
a
moment
he
was
alone
with
Albert
.
<EOS>
There
was
apause
of
some
minutes
’
duration
,
and
then
Sir
Francis
said,—“You
may
,
or
you
may
not
,
as
it
may
please
you
,
give
me
an
account
ofthis
affair
.
<EOS>
”“For
the
sake
of
the
name
I
bear
and
the
memory
of
my
dear
father,”said
Albert
<EOS>
,
“
I
will
declare
my
innocence
and
although
you
may
judge
mewrongfully
,
shall
die
happy
,
if
you
will
do
justice
to
one
who
isdearer
to
me
than
myself
.
<EOS>
That
one
is
the
persecuted
Ada
,
who
,
if
shebe
still
living
,
I
implore
you
to
succour
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
sir
,
you
do
not
knowher
—
and
—
<EOS>
and
I
have
no
words
to
paint
her
to
you
.
<EOS>
”“But
about
this
murder
?
”
said
Sir
Francis
,
uneasily
.
<EOS>
“I
will
tell
you
all
I
know
.
<EOS>
Being
some
time
since
destitute
,
I
appliedto
one
Learmont
for
employment
,
and
was
by
him
entertained
as
hissecretary
.
<EOS>
”“So
<EOS>
have
I
heard
.
<EOS>
Go
on
,
sir
.
<EOS>
”“The
first
confidential
employment
he
put
me
on
was
to
follow
a
manhome
,
who
he
thought
was
imposing
upon
his
benevolence
,
but
before
Icould
proceed
upon
that
employment
I
had
related
to
him
the
secret
ofmy
heart
—
my
passionate
love
for
Ada
,
<EOS>
even
as
I
told
it
to
you
,
sir
—
mylong
and
weary
search
for
her
—
my
bitter
reflections
concerning
thecruelty
of
Jacob
Gray
—
I
told
him
all
that
,
and
his
generosity
seemedmuch
worked
upon
.
<EOS>
He
proffered
me
unbounded
assistance
.
<EOS>
His
wealth
—
hispower
—
all
he
said
should
be
exerted
to
do
justice
to
the
innocent
.
<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
you
believed
him?”“I
did
,
and
was
happy
in
the
thought
that
Ada
would
be
rescued
from
hermiseries
.
<EOS>
Then
by
a
strange
chance
it
turned
out
that
this
very
man
whohe
had
commissioned
me
to
watch
to
his
house
<EOS>
was
Jacob
Gray
.
”“Indeed
!
”
<EOS>
said
Sir
Francis
,
in
a
peculiar
tone
.
<EOS>
“Yes
,
and
then
I
thanked
Heaven
for
its
great
goodness
,
and
believedmyself
on
the
road
to
happiness
.
<EOS>
I
did
watch
Gray
home
and
flew
toLearmont
with
the
news
.
<EOS>
He
then
enjoined
me
by
a
solemn
promise
toallow
him
the
whole
management
of
the
affair
,
which
,
from
gratitude
tohim
,
I
could
not
refuse
,
but
I
lingered
ever
round
the
house
where
Ibelieved
Ada
to
be
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
deny
myself
the
delight
of
fancyingmyself
near
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
joy
to
look
upon
the
house
that
I
thoughtcontained
her
—
to
watch
a
passing
shadow
at
a
window
,
and
fancy
it
washers
;
during
that
watch
I
encountered
your
officer
,
whose
motive
inbeing
a
spy
upon
Jacob
Gray
I
could
not
divine
.
<EOS>
”“Last
night
I
commenced
my
watch
,
and
being
hidden
in
a
deep
doorway
,
immediately
opposite
the
house
,
which
engrossed
all
my
attention
,
I
sawbetween
the
hours
of
twelve
and
one
,
two
men
approach
and
pause
at
theresidence
of
Gray
.
<EOS>
By
some
means
they
quickly
opened
the
door
when
,
partially
emerging
from
my
place
of
concealment
,
I
saw
that
one
of
themwas
Learmont
.
<EOS>
”Sir
<EOS>
Francis
Hartleton
slightly
started
and
changed
his
posture
,
so
thatAlbert
could
not
see
his
face
.
<EOS>
“The
other
,
”
continued
Albert
,
“
I
know
not
.
<EOS>
”“What
<EOS>
kind
of
man
was
he?”“A
tall
bulky
man
.
<EOS>
”“The
smith
—
the
smith
,
”
thought
Sir
Francis
to
himself
.
<EOS>
“The
door
was
closed
when
they
had
entered
the
house
,
and
in
an
agonyof
impatience
I
waited
for
their
re
-
appearance
,
expecting
to
see
Adawith
them
,
for
I
doubted
not
<EOS>
but
the
squire
was
rescuing
her
from
JacobGray
.
<EOS>
”“Well
,
well
,
”
said
Sir
Francis
in
a
tone
of
deep
interest
,
“
whatfollowed
then?”“One
o’clock
had
struck
,
and
no
one
came
forth
,
nor
could
I
hear
anycommotion
in
the
house
—
my
agony
of
impatience
was
growing
exquisitelypainful
—
my
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
only
window
which
showed
a
light
,
and
I
was
on
the
point
of
forgetting
all
promises
and
rushing
over
tothe
house
,
when
with
a
crash
a
considerable
portion
of
the
window
wasforced
outwards
,
and
a
faint
scream
caught
my
ears;—maddened
byapprehension
for
Ada
<EOS>
,
I
rushed
across
the
road
and
knocked
loudly
atthe
door
.
<EOS>
Then
scarcely
waiting
for
an
answer
,
I
burst
it
open
,
andshouting
the
came
of
Ada
,
I
rushed
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
”Sir
<EOS>
Francis
rose
from
his
chair
and
in
a
voice
that
echoed
through
theroom
,
he
cried,—“Young
man
<EOS>
,
on
your
soul
is
this
all
true?”“On
my
soul
,
”
said
Albert
.
<EOS>
“As
<EOS>
you
hope
for
Heaven
’s
mercy?”Albert
<EOS>
stretched
out
his
arm
as
he
said
solemnly
,
“
May
the
curse
of
Godbe
upon
me
evermore
if
what
I
say
be
not
the
truth
.
<EOS>
I
am
innocent
—
I
aminnocent
.
<EOS>
”Sir
<EOS>
Francis
sunk
into
his
seat
again
,
and
drew
a
long
breath
before
hesaid,—“You
shall
have
justice
.
<EOS>
Be
assured
you
shall
have
justice
—
go
on
,
Ipray
you
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
have
little
more
to
add
,
save
that
I
obtained
a
light
of
a
female
inthe
house
,
and
that
still
calling
upon
Ada
,
I
ascended
to
the
roomwhere
lay
awfully
mangled
the
ghastly
remains
of
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
Upon
mydescent
,
your
officers
seized
me
,
and
accused
me
of
the
murder
.
<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
that
cloak?”“Is
not
mine
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
natural
feelings
of
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
<EOS>
’s
heart
would
haveprompted
him
on
the
instant
to
tell
Albert
that
he
fully
believed
whathe
said
,
but
while
he
never
,
when
acting
in
his
magisterial
capacity
,
forgot
that
he
was
a
man
,
he
now
felt
the
necessity
of
remembering
thata
sworn
deposition
had
taken
place
.
<EOS>
With
some
difficulty
then
hemastered
his
feelings
,
and
said,—“I
shall
proceed
at
once
to
the
house
where
the
deed
in
question
hasbeen
committed
,
and
be
assured
that
all
shall
be
done
to
discover
thetruth
.
<EOS>
Till
then
you
must
remain
here
in
custody

<EOS>
As
a

I
canonly
act
upon

CHAPTER
CVIII.Albert
’s
Despair.—The
Tests
of
Truth
.
<EOS>
With
far
pleasanter
feelings
as
regarded
Ada
and
her
fortunes
than
hehad
ever
experienced
since
his
opinion
of
the
unworthiness
of
AlbertSeyton
,
Sir
Francis
arrived
at
the
house
where
so
awful
a
scene
ofbloodshed
had
taken
place
.
<EOS>
He
was
immediately
saluted
with
respect
by
aconstable
who
had
remained
in
charge
of
the
shattered
door
,
and
uponentering
the
house
,
the
first
person
belonging
to
it
he
saw
was
JacobGray
’s
landlady
,
who
sat
in
her
parlour
wringing
her
hands
,
andlamenting
the
death
which
had
taken
place
under
such
horriblecircumstances
in
her
house
,
and
which
as
she
feelingly
remarked
,
was
“
auncommon
wicked
thing
considering
she
was
a
lone
woman
,
and
livedprincipally
by
letting
her
lodging
for
nobody
would
n’t
come
and
live
inthe
house
now
,
because
Mr.
Gray
’s
ghostesses
would
,
as
a
matter
ofcourse
,
haunt
the
attic
and
the
staircase
,
so
it
would
.
<EOS>
”“Now
,
my
good
woman
,
”
said
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
“
I
am
a
magistrate
,
so
tell
me
now
how
all
this
happened
.
<EOS>
”“Lord
love
you
,
sir
,
if
you
was
six
magistrates
,
I
could
n’t
tell
you
.
<EOS>
All
I
knows
is
,
as
I
am
a
ruinated
woman
.
<EOS>
”“Well
<EOS>
,
well
,
something
must
be
done
for
you
,
but
I
want
to
know
whatyou
heard
about
this
murder
.
”“Oh
!
<EOS>
Dear
me
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Master
Gray
was
such
a
great
man
,
he
was
,
and
hisrelations
must
be
wretches
.
<EOS>
”“His
relations?”“Yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
When
he
comed
to
live
here
,
he
says
,
says
he
,
my
relationswould
take
my
life
if
they
could
.
<EOS>
That
’s
what
he
said
.
<EOS>
Well
,
I
didn’tthink
much
of
that
,
but
last
night
—
no
,
it
was
after
twelve
,
for
Irecollect
<EOS>
I
’d
heard
the
Abbey
-
clock
strike
,
’cos
<EOS>
the
wind
blowed
inthat
quarter
.
<EOS>
Well
,
I
was
a
listening
to
the
rain
,
when
I
heard
neversuch
a
smash
in
my
shop
.
<EOS>
‘
What
’s
that
?
’
<EOS>
says
I
,
and
without
more
ado
,
Igets
a
light
,
and
I
goes
out
.
<EOS>
”“Well
<EOS>
,
and
you
saw
the
young
man?”“No
,
I
did
n’t
sir
.
<EOS>
There
was
two
villains
,
sir
—
one
was
a
amazing
tallvillain
,
and
the
other
was
uncommon
big
,
only
the
amazing
tall
villainlooked
so
in
consequence
of
being
so
desperate
thin
,
he
did
.
<EOS>
Well
,
sir
,
the
other
villain
,
not
the
amazing
tall
one
,
he
asks
where
master
Graylives
,
and
I
tells
him
,
then
he
says
as
he
’s
his
uncle
,
and
desires
meto
say
nothink
,
and
ties
me
to
my
blessed
bed
post
and
laughed
in
myface
.
<EOS>
The
idea
,
sir
,
of
laughing
at
a
lone
woman
.
”“Seyton
has
spoken
the
truth
,
”
said
Sir
Francis
;
“
Learmont
and
Brittonhave
murdered
Gray
.
<EOS>
”“Sir
<EOS>
,
”
said
the
woman
.
<EOS>
“Nothing
—
nothing
;
is
there
any
one
else
in
the
house?”“Yes
sir
;
there
’s
an
old
lady
up
stairs
,
and
she
says
as
she
gave
alight
to
one
of
the
murderers
.
<EOS>
”“All
confirms
his
statement
,
”
thought
Hartleton
;
“
all
that
now
remainsfor
me
to
do
is
to
secure
Gray
’s
confession
.
”
<EOS>
Turning
then
to
hisofficers
,
he
said,—“Show
me
to
the
murdered
man
’s
room
,
”
and
following
them
up
the
narrowstaircase
,
a
few
minutes
brought
him
to
the
presence
of
the
awfulremains
of
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
shuddered
as
he
looked
upon
thedreadful
spectacle
,
and
turning
away
his
eyes
,
he
said,—“Do
not
allow
the
body
to
be
moved
.
<EOS>
There
will
be
an
inquest
on
it
,
butsearch
every
hole
and
corner
of
the
room
for
any
papers
,
and
should
yousee
any
,
give
them
into
no
hands
but
mine
.
<EOS>
”The
search
which
took
place
was
the
most
energetic
and
active
thatcould
possibly
be
made
;
but
it
was
,
of
course
,
quite
unsuccessful
;
soafter
a
full
hour
being
spent
in
it
,
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
mostreluctantly
turned
towards
the
corpse
,
saying
to
his
men—“You
are
not
afraid
of
a
dead
body
?
<EOS>
The
papers
I
spoke
to
you
about
aremost
important
,
<EOS>
and
as
they
may
be
about
him
,
I
wish
you
to
search
thepockets
.
<EOS>
”Hardened
<EOS>
as
those
men
were
,
and
callous
to
most
scenes
of
horror
,
theyapproached
the
remains
of
Gray
with
evident
reluctance
,
and
made
abrief
search
of
his
pockets
.
<EOS>
Nothing
was
found
but
a
small
sum
of
moneyand
a
wedge
-
shaped
steel
instrument
,
which
was
then
commonly
used
byhousebreakers
to
wrench
open
doors
with
.
<EOS>
“There
are
no
papers
here
,
sir
,
”
said
the
men
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
turned
from
the
room
with
a
look
of
greatdisappointment
.
<EOS>
He
entertained
now
not
a
moment
’s
doubt
,
but
that
theobject
of
Learmont
’s
murder
of
Gray
was
to
get
possession
of
the
packetaddressed
to
him
,
Sir
Francis
,
and
there
was
every
reason
to
believethat
in
that
object
the
squire
had
succeeded
.
<EOS>
“Ada
’s
name
and
birth
<EOS>
,
”
thought
Hartleton
,
“
seem
ever
doomed
to
remainmysterious
—
well
,
she
may
still
be
happy
,
and
as
for
Learmont
andBritton
,
they
must
,
at
all
events
,
expiate
this
crime
upon
the
scaffoldif
it
is
brought
home
to
them
.
<EOS>
”Full
of
these
mingled
reflections
<EOS>
,
Sir
Francis
hurried
back
to
hishouse
,
and
sought
the
room
in
which
sat
poor
Albert
Seyton
,
melancholyand
solitary
for
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
whether
his
tale
,
truthful
as
it
was
,
was
believed
by
the
magistrate
or
not
;
and
when
SirFrancis
appeared
again
before
him
,
he
rose
,
with
a
saddened
countenanceto
hear
what
he
had
to
say
to
him
.
<EOS>
“Mr
.
<EOS>
Seyton
,
”
said
Hartleton
,
“
what
you
have
told
me
has
beenconfirmed
,
as
far
as
it
could
be
,
by
the
parties
in
the
house
I
havebeen
to
;
but
tell
me
now
how
it
was
that
you
,
after
communicating
to
methe
singular
facts
you
did
concerning
this
Ada
,
stayed
away
from
me
solong?”“I
<EOS>
called
upon
you
,
sir
,
”
said
Albert
,
“
and
not
seeing
you
,
I
fanciedyou
had
cooled
upon
the
matter
.
<EOS>
The
squire
Learmont
had
prejudiced
meagainst
you
,
representing
you
as
cold
and
selfish
.
”“Mr
.
<EOS>
Seyton
—
you
have
yet
to
learn
that
those
who
say
the
least
areoften
the
most
to
be
trusted
.
<EOS>
I
am
convinced
of
your
innocence
of
thismurder
.
<EOS>
”Albert
clasped
his
hands
as
he
cried—“Thank
Heaven
!
<EOS>
Thank
Heaven
!
<EOS>
I
shall
not
die
the
death
of
a
felon
.
<EOS>
Insome
battle
for
right
against
might
<EOS>
,
I
am
content
now
in
a
foreign
landto
lay
down
my
life
.
<EOS>
Something
tells
me
that
Ada
is
lost
to
me
forever
.
<EOS>
The
villain
Gray
must
have
taken
her
life
,
and
I
am
desolate
.
<EOS>
”“You
jump
,
perchance
,
too
hastily
at
that
conclusion
,
”
said
SirFrancis
.
<EOS>
“
You
may
yet
find
her
.
<EOS>
She
may
even
some
time
since
haveescaped
from
Gray
.
”“Oh
<EOS>
if
I
could
but
think
so
.
<EOS>
”“Why
<EOS>
should
you
not
?
<EOS>
Besides
,
do
you
mean
to
give
up
your
friend
,
thesquire

<EOS>
”“I
do
—
<EOS>
from
the
first
I
have
had
my
suspicions
of
that
man
.
<EOS>
It
is
notfor
me
to
say
he
killed
Jacob
Gray
,
but
I
will
see
him
no
more

<EOS>
Hisways
are
crooked
and
mysterious

<EOS>
”“Why
,
he
certainly
is
not
the
most
open

candid
character
in

,
Mr.
Seyton
;
but
were
I
you

I
would
not

give
up
all
hope

”“Oh

<EOS>
sir

if
I
could
find
the
smallest
foothold
for
hope
to
rest
upon
,
I
should
be
again

as
I

sanguine

my

is
very
sad

full
of
despair

<EOS>
”“I

replied
Albert
,
“
that
I
marked
out
formyself
before

Squire

<EOS>
I

I

<EOS>
”With
<EOS>
a
heavy
heart
Albert
rose
,
and
bowing
to
Sir
Francis
,
who
followedhim
to
the
room
-
door
,
and
gave
orders
for
his
free
egress
,
he
passedout
of
the
house
,
sick
and
weary
at
heart
.
<EOS>
Albert
then
paused
in
the
street
a
moment
,
and
the
idea
came
across
himthat
it
was
just
possible
he
might
by
calling
upon
Learmont
,
procuresome
hint
or
information
of
the
fate
of
Ada
;
but
he
rejected
theproposition
almost
as
quickly
as
he
formed
it
,
and
the
ghastly
corpseof
Gray
rose
up
before
his
imagination
,
mutely
,
but
strongly
accusingLearmont
of
the
murder
.
<EOS>
“No
—
<EOS>
no
,
”
he
said
,
“
that
man
is
a
man
of
blood
!
<EOS>
For
some
cause
unknownto
me
,
he
has
made
me
a
mere
tool
in
his
hands
to
aid
in
thedestruction
of
Gray

<EOS>
I
will
leave
him
to
his
conscience
,
and
to

<EOS>
I
will
see
him
no

<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
unhappy
young
man
then
turned
his
steps
towards
the
park
,
andsauntering
down
the
Birdcage
-
walk
,
till
he
came
to
the
old
barracks
,
heaccosted
a
soldier
who
was
lounging
by
the
gate
.
<EOS>
Albert
had
never
once
glanced
behind
him
,
or
he
might
have
seen
SirFrancis
Hartleton
,
who
had
,
resolving
to
be
perfectly
assured
inAlbert
’s
truth
and
faith
,
permitted
him
to
leave
the
house
in
themanner
we
have
recorded
,
but
followed
him
as
closely
as
consistent
withordinary
caution
.
<EOS>
Had
Albert
gone
to
Learmont
<EOS>
’s
<EOS>
,
new
suspicions
wouldhave
risen
up
in
the
mind
of
the
magistrate
,
and
choked
like
noxiousweeds
the
kindly
feelings
which
he
was
beginning
to
entertain
towardshim
;
but
now
that
he
saw
him
enter
the
park
,
and
proceed
towards
thebarracks
,
Sir
Francis
felt
the
pleasure
which
a
noble
mind
alwaysreceives
from
getting
rid
of
suspicion
and
doubt
.
<EOS>
Albert
and
the
soldier
passed
into
the
barracks
,
and
then
Sir
FrancisHartleton
immediately
stepped
up
to
the
gate
,
and
addressing
anothersoldier
,
said,—“I
must
see
that
young

just
passed

<EOS>
My

<EOS>
”Sir
<EOS>
Francis
was
well
known
by
reputation

upon
his
announcement
ofwho
he
was
,
the
soldier
ran
after
his
comrade

Seyton
,

broughtthem
both
back
to
the
gate
again

<EOS>
“What
does
this
young

said
Sir
Francis

<EOS>
“He
<EOS>
offers

said
the

I
was
conductinghim

<EOS>
”“I

remarked
the
magistrate

<EOS>
“
Willyou

said
Albert
,
proudly
;
“

<EOS>
”“Nay

I
have
something

<EOS>
”“You

too
late

said
Albert
.
<EOS>
“
I
came
to
you
in
my
agony

implored
you

<EOS>
said
thesoldier

was
in
apprehension

lose

gratuity
forbringing
so
unexceptionable

“If

When
your
activity
is
implored
,
you
are
cold
and
most
indifferent
,
butnow
when
your
presence
is
quite
unlooked
for

unnecessary

you
comeafter

annoy

Take

”“But

I
have
not
done

said
Sir
Francis
,
with
provokingcoolness
.
<EOS>
“
I

<EOS>
”Albert
<EOS>
’s
cheek
flushed
with
indignation
,
as
he
cried,—“Sir

Hartleton

you
came
to
insult
me

<EOS>
Unworthy
is
it
of

revelling
in
the
amplitude

You
are—”“Come

interrupted
Sir

<EOS>
“
You

”“I

<EOS>
Ho

there!”The
magistrate
turned
and
beckoned
to
his
officers
,
whom
he
haddirected
to
follow
him
,
and
when
they
sprang
forward
to
the
gate
,
hesaid,—“Take

young

”“This

the
very
wantonness

cried
Albert

<EOS>
“
How

<EOS>
”“Take

away

”Albert
was
immediately
seized
,
and
burning
with
rage
,
conveyed
to

again

CHAPTER
CIX.The
Meeting
of
the
Lovers
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
<EOS>
’s
officers
paid
but
<EOS>
little
heed
to
the
loud
andangry
remonstrances
of
Albert
Seyton
,
but
hurried
him
the
shortdistance
between
the
park
and
the
magistrate
’s
house
,
at
which
in
a
fewminutes
they
arrived
,
and
in
obedience
to
their
orders
fastened
him
inthe
same
room
from
where
he
had
come
so
recently
.
<EOS>
As
Sir
Francis
stood
for
a
moment
on
the
threshold
of
the
apartment
,
Albert
turned
to
him
and
said—“Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
for
the
treacherous
and
ungentlemanly
conductof
which
I
have
been
the
victim
,
I
will
now
denounce
you
as
a
disgraceto
the
office
you
hold
.
<EOS>
I
look
upon
you
as—”“Nay
,
<EOS>
nay
—
hold
,
”
cried
the
magistrate
,
“
I
will
hear
no
more
.
<EOS>
The
lessyou
say
,
the
less
you
will
have
to
retract
and
ask
my
pardon
for
.
<EOS>
”“Your
pardon
?
”
<EOS>
cried
Albert
;
“
I—”“Shut
the
door
<EOS>
,
he
is
raving
,
”
interposed
the
magistrate
,
and
in
amoment
Albert
was
alone
.
<EOS>
The
young
man
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
,
in
deep
disgust
withSir
Francis
,
and
revolving
in
his
own
mind
what
he
should
do
in
thesituation
he
was
now
placed
in
.
<EOS>
He
walked
to
the
window
whichoverlooked
a
garden
,
but
there
were
iron
bars
across
the
frame
-
work
,
which
appeared
too
firmly
let
into
solid
oak
to
be
removed
withoutappropriate
tools
.
<EOS>
“I
will
not
,
however
,
be
caged
here
if
I
can
help
it
,
”
thought
Albert;and
<EOS>
he
seized
one
of
the
bars
,
and
exerted
all
his
strength
to
move
it
,
but
it
was
in
vain
,
for
it
showed
no
signs
of
giving
way
.
<EOS>
Albert
thenglanced
around
him
for
some
weapon
,
but
none
such
was
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
Hethen
threw
himself
into
a
chair
,
and
after
a
few
hasty
expressions
ofindignation
,
relapsed
into
melancholy
silence
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
then
,
herecollected
a
small
knife
that
he
had
in
his
pocket
,
and
he
thought
hemight
possibly
be
able
to
cut
away
sufficient
of
the
wood
-
work
towrench
out
one
of
the
bars
from
the
window
,
which
,
could
he
accomplishit
,
would
leave
a
space
sufficiently
large
for
him
to
get
through
,
anddrop
into
the
garden
,
which
was
at
no
very
great
depth
,
although
amplysufficient
to
make
any
one
,
not
labouring
under
the
excitement
of
mindthat
Albert
was
,
pause
ere
<EOS>
they
adventured
the
leap
.
<EOS>
He
found
the
job
of
cutting
away
the
wood
-
work
at
the
window
a
long
anda
tedious
one
,
for
he
could
only
get
the
oak
away
in
small
pieces
,
andthe
iron
bars
were
very
deeply
imbedded
.
<EOS>
“I
have
heard
,
”
thought
Albert
,
“
of
these
things
being
done
with
moreinefficient
tools
than
a
tolerably
good
knife
,
aided
by
perseverance
,
Ishall
rejoice
to
give
this
tricky
magistrate
the
slip
,
even
if
I
walkdirectly
to
another
,
and
claim
an
inquiry
into
the
causes
of
my
presentmost
unjustifiable
detention
.
<EOS>
”“When
<EOS>
the
heart
is
in
any
work
,
it
makes
good
progress
,
”
says
LordBacon
;
and
<EOS>
so
it
seemed
in
the
present
instance
,
for
Albert
was
rapidlygetting
towards
the
end
of
the
bar
,
when
an
unhappy
circumstanceretarded
his
labours
.
<EOS>
In
getting
out
a
large
piece
of
the
wood
,
hestruck
the
blade
of
the
knife
on
one
side
,
and
snapped
it
short
off
bythe
handle
.
<EOS>
In
the
excitement
,
then
,
of
the
moment
,
he
seized
the
bar
,
and
did
what
,
at
a
cooler
time
,
he
could
not
have
done
,
namely
,
wrenched
one
end
of
it
from
its
hold
.
<EOS>
The
powerful
leverage
he
now
had
,
soon
enabled
him
to
free
it
at
the
other
extremity
,
and
a
prospect
ofescape
seemed
on
the
instant
opened
to
him
.
<EOS>
In
a
moment
he
threw
up
the
window
,
and
glancing
into
the
garden
,
hewas
on
the
point
of
springing
out
,
when
he
saw
that
there
were
someiron
rails
covering
some
underground
part
of
the
premises
,
upon
whichhe
must
have
fell
,
had
he
adventured
the
leap
.
<EOS>
Albert
paused
for
amoment
,
and
the
sudden
thought
struck
him
that
he
could
make
a
means
ofdescending
in
safety
.
<EOS>
He
took
Gray
’s
cloak
,
which
had
been
left
hangingon
the
back
of
a
chair
,
and
firmly
tying
one
corner
of
it
to
one
of
theremaining
bars
of
the
window
,
he
let
the
remainder
hang
out
,
intendingto
slide
down
by
it
.
<EOS>
“Now
,
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
”
he
exclaimed
,
“
with
all
your
power
I
amable
once
more
to
defy
you
;
and
lest
my
flight
should
give
occasion
tosurmises
of
my
guilt
,
on
account
of
Jacob
Gray
’s
murder
,
I
will
betakeme
to
the
nearest
magistrate
,
and
allow
him
to
hold
me
in
custody
if
hepleases
.
”He
<EOS>
flung
himself
out
at
the
window
.
<EOS>
His
weight
cut
the
cloak
across
,
and
there
fell
at
his
feet
a
folded
paper
.
<EOS>
The
young
man
lay
stunnedfor
a
moment
by
his
sudden
fall
.
<EOS>
Then
he
slowly
rose
,
and
his
eye
fellupon
the
paper
;
it
was
addressed—“To
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
with
speed
.
<EOS>
”Albert
clasped
his
hands
,
and
a
cry
of
surprise
escaped
him
.
<EOS>
He
knewthe
endorsement
—
it
was
Jacob
Gray
’s
confession
.
<EOS>
We
must
now
leave
Albert
for
some
few
moments
to
his
mingled
feelingsof
surprise
,
and
joy
,
and
grief
,
for
such
were
all
struggling
in
hisbreast
,
in
order
to
follow
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
to
his
own
privatestudy
,
whither
he
instantly
repaired
after
seeing
Albert
,
as
hethought
,
properly
secured
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
He
sat
down
,
and
covering
his
eyes
with
his
hands
,
a
habit
he
had
whenhe
wished
a
steady
communion
with
his
own
thoughts
,
he
remained
silentfor
some
time
.
<EOS>
Then
he
spoke
in
a
low
voice
,
and
with
a
confident
tone
.
<EOS>
“This
young
man
’s
honesty
and
honour
,
”
he
said
,
“
has
been
sufficientlytested
,
and
the
noble
confidence
of
Ada
in
his
love
and
sincerity
is
,
thank
Heaven
,
not
misplaced
.
<EOS>
The
mystery
that
envelopes
Ada
’s
name
andhistory
<EOS>
,
I
fear
now
will
never
be
disclosed
;
but
I
must
make
these
twoyoung
people
happy
,
and
they
will
be
foolish
to
torment
themselvesabout
the
past
,
when
the
present
will
be
so
dear
to
them
,
and
thefuture
so
full
of
hope
.
<EOS>
There
shall
be
no
sense
of
dependence
,
for
Iwill
exert
all
my
interest
to
procure
Albert
Seyton
some
honourableemployment
;
and
although
the
solution
of
the
mysterious
conduct
ofLearmont
and
his
strange
connection
with
Gray
and
Britton
may
go
to
thegrave
with
him
,
yet
she
,
the
long
suffering
,
persecuted
girl
will
behappy
with
the
object
of
her
heart
’s
choice
.
<EOS>
I
must
see
her
and
prepareher
for
the
interview
which
she
shall
have
with
him
.
<EOS>
How
will
his
angerat
his
detention
here
change
its
complexion
when
he
knows
its
cause
.
<EOS>
”Sir
Francis
then
summoned
an
attendant
,
and
desired
that
Ada
might
berequested
to
come
to
him
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
The
message
was
dulydelivered
,
and
in
a
few
moments
our
heroine
,
to
whose
fortunes
we
haveclung
so
long
,
and
who
holds
so
large
a
place
in
our
hearts
,
glidedlike
a
spirit
of
beauty
into
the
magistrate
’s
study
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
when
he
had
offered
her
a
seat
,
looked
withkindly
interest
in
her
face
,
and
said—“Ada
;
you
look
unhappy
;
you
are
paler
than
you
were
.
<EOS>
”A
<EOS>
slight
increase
of
colour
visited
Ada
’s
cheek
,
as
she
replied
in
hersweet
,
<EOS>
low
musical
voice,—“I
am
all
unused
to
cloak
my
feelings
either
of
joy
or
of
sorrow

<EOS>
I
have
told
myself
often
that
I
am
most
ungrateful
to
youfor
your
great
kindness
to
me
,
by
being
unhappy
;
but
the
heart
will
notbe
reasoned
with
,
and
the
subtlest
logic
of
the
mind
will
fail
to
stopa
tear
from
dimming
the
eye
,
when
the
full
heart
says
‘
weep
.
<EOS>
’”“You
are
full
of
regret
,
Ada
,
that
I
think
harshly
of
young
AlbertSeyton
.
<EOS>
”“I

said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“
Oh

<EOS>
You

”“Hear

added
Sir
Francis
with
emotion
.
<EOS>
“
Since
I
last

alter

<EOS>
”A
<EOS>
half
suppressed
cry
of
joy
escaped
the
lips
of
Ada
,
and
then
sheclasped
her
hands
;
and
while
the
rapid
beating
of
her
heart
testifiedto
the
emotion
occasioned
by
Sir
Francis
’s
words
,
she
fixed
upon

her
beautiful

eagerly
dwelt
on
every
word
heuttered
.
<EOS>
“Believe

he
said
,
“

“And

Sir

”Ada
<EOS>
burst
into
tears
,
and
sobbed
for
very
joy
,
while
the
magistrateturned
his
head
aside
to
conceal
his
own
emotion

<EOS>
“My
<EOS>

he
said
,
after
a
pause
,
“

”“It

<EOS>
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“It

rose
and
placed
both
her
hands
in
those
of
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
and
smiling
upon
him
through
her
tears
,
<EOS>
she
said,—“Dear

”Ada
could
not
understand
what
Sir
Francis
meant
by
his
last
words
,
butat
that
moment
<EOS>
she
was
not
much
inclined
to
ask
explanations

buttaking
the
key
while
her
hand
trembled
,
and
her
lustrous
eyes
seemedswimming
in
an
ocean
of
tenderness
as
she
glided
from
the
room
torescue
her
lover

<EOS>
Ada
knew
the
room
well
to
which
Sir
Francis
had
directed
her
,
and
hereager
footsteps
in
a
few
moments
brought
her
to
the
door

<EOS>
For
one
briefmoment
then
she
paused
to
recover
herself
from
her
state
of
agitation

<EOS>
In
the
next
she
had
opened
the
door
—
the
room
was
tenantless

<EOS>
Ada
flewto
the
window
—
there
hung
the
torn
cloak
.
<EOS>
“Albert

Albert
,
”
she
cried
,
and
sunk
upon
the
floor
in
an
agony
ofgrief
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
heard
the
cry
of
Ada
,
and
hastening
from
hisroom
,
the
truth
shot
across
his
mind
in
a
moment
when
he
saw
the
cloakhanging
by
the
iron
bar

<EOS>
“Who
could
have

<EOS>
he
cried

He
can
not

cried
Ada
;
“

I
meditated
giving

he

a

Sir

spoke
,
there
arose
a
confused
noise
in

his
going
to

window
,
he
saw
Albert
in
the
grasp
of
two
of
hisofficers
.
<EOS>
Without
any
remark
concerning
what
he
was
to
say
,
he
turnedto
Ada
and
said,—“Leave
all
to
me
.
<EOS>
Do
you
remain
here
,
Ada
,
until
I
come
to
you
.
<EOS>
Ipledge
you
my
word
all
shall
be
explained
to
your
satisfaction
withinthis
present
hour
.
<EOS>
”Sir
<EOS>
Francis
then
hurried
from
the
room
,
leaving
Ada
in
a
greater
stateof
bewilderment
than
ever
,
and
,
hastening
to
the
garden
,
he
met
theofficers
who
had
recaptured
Albert
.
<EOS>
“So
,
sir
,
”
said
Sir
Francis
,
“
you
have
,
methinks
,
a
small
amount
ofpatience
.
”“Patience
<EOS>
,
sir
,
”
cried
Albert
.
<EOS>
“
Why
should
I
have
any
under
a
tyrannyas
unexampled
as
it
is
despicable
?
<EOS>
In
plain
words
,
sir
,
tell
me
whatyou
mean
by
detaining
me?”“Young
man
,
it
is
for
your
own
good
.
<EOS>
Let
me
advise
you
now
,
for
yourown
benefit
.
<EOS>
I
shall
send
some
one
to
you
,
to
talk
you
out
of
yourunreasonable
humour
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
warn
you
,
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
”
said
Albert
.
<EOS>
“
I
am
now
upon
mydefence
,
and
,
if
you
send
any
of
your
myrmidons
to
me
,
they
may
chanceto
regret
coming
within
the
reach
of
my
arm
.
”“Indeed
!
<EOS>
Now
,
I
will
wager
you
my
head
that
you
will
be
in
a
morecomplaisant
humour
shortly
.
<EOS>
Bring
him
in
,
and
confine
him
in
myparlour
.
<EOS>
”Resistance
<EOS>
against
the
powerful
men
who
held
him
,
Albert
felt
would
bequite
absurd
,
and
merely
wasting
his
energies
to
no
purpose
;
so
hesuffered
himself
,
although
boiling
with
rage
,
to
be
led
into
a
room
onthe
ground
floor
.
<EOS>
“Now
<EOS>
my
young
friend
,
”
said
Sir
Francis
,
“
I
shall
send
some
one
to
youto
tame
your
proud
spirit
.
<EOS>
”“I
defy
your
utmost
malice
,
”
cried
Albert
.
<EOS>
“Oh!—Let
him
rave
—
let
him
rave
.
<EOS>
Shut
him
in
,
”
said
Sir
Francis
calmly
.
<EOS>
The
moment
the
door
was
closed
upon
the
prisoner
,
he
drew
from
hisbreast
the
confession
of
Gray
,
and
was
upon
the
point
of
opening
it
,
when
his
high
sense
of
honour
forbade
him
breaking
the
seal
of
acommunication
addressed
to
another
,
and
he
dropped
it
on
the
floor
,
ashe
said,—“No
,
no
!
<EOS>
Although
this
magistrate
,
from
some
inexplicable
cause
,
is
myenemy
,
I
must
not
forget
that
I
am
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
words
were
scarcely
out
from
his
mouth
,
when
he
heard
the
doorunlock
gently
,
and
arming
himself
then
,
with
all
the
indignation
hefelt
,
he
cried
in
a
loud
voice,—“Whoever
<EOS>
you
are
,
advance
here
,
<EOS>
at
your
peril!”The
door
opened
very
slowly
,
and
when
it
was
just
wide
enough
for
theperson
to
enter
Ada
glided
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
“At
<EOS>
my
peril
,
Albert
?
”
<EOS>
she
said
.
<EOS>
The
colour
forsook
the
cheek
of
Albert
,
and
he
stood
gazing
at
her
fora
few
moments
,
incapable
of
thought
or
action
;
then
,
with
a
gush
ofjoy
,
he
flew
towards
her
.
<EOS>
“Ada
,
Ada
!
<EOS>
My
dear
Ada
,
are
you
in
life
or
am
I
mocked
by
some
vision
:
<EOS>
My
Ada
,
speak!”“Albert
.
”He
clasped
her
to
his
heart
.
<EOS>
He
kissed
her
cheek
,
her
brow
,
her
hands
.
<EOS>
Tears
gushed
from
his
eyes
,
and
mingled
with
those
of
the
long
-
lost
,
fondly
cherished
idol
of
his
heart
.
<EOS>
They
could
neither
of
them
speak
,
and
nothing
was
heard
for
many
minutes
in
that
room
,
but
sobs
ofgushing
joy
,
such
as
make
the
heart
leap
in
extacy
,
and
give
humanity
aglimpse
of
heaven

CHAPTER
CX.The
<EOS>
Lovers.—The
Interview
of
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
with
the
Secretaryof
State.—The
Ball
.
<EOS>
Albert
Seyton
first
broke
the
silence
,
and
as
he
clasped
Ada
’s
hands
,
and
gazed
into
her
beaming
eyes
,
he
said,—“Ada
!
<EOS>
My
own
beautiful
Ada
!
<EOS>
Am
I
,
indeed
,
so
blessed
?
<EOS>
Do
I
once
againsee
you
in
all
your
beauty
,
smiling
on
me
?
<EOS>
Am
I
dreaming
,
or
are
you;indeed
,
and
in
truth
,
my
own
dear
Ada?—The
dream
of
my
boyhood
,
thecherished
idol
of
my
heart
.
”“Indeed
,
and
in
truth
!
”
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“
Oh
!
I
am
too
,
too
,
happy
.
<EOS>
Heavenforgive
me
all
my
sinful
repining
.
<EOS>
Does
not
this
moment
’s
joy
repay
mefor
all
?
<EOS>
My
darling
—
my
true
and
beautiful—”What
a
heavenly
light
shone
from
the
eyes
of
Ada
!
<EOS>
What
a
sunny
smileplayed
around
her
cheery
mouth
,
dimpling
her
cheek
with
beauty
.
<EOS>
“We
<EOS>
will
part
no
more
,
Albert
,
”
she
said
.
<EOS>
“
After
many
,
many
trials
,
wehave
met
at
last
to
part
no
more
.
<EOS>
God
has
blessed
us
in
each
other’slove
,
and
we
will
not
cast
from
us
the
pure
bright
gift
of
heaven!”“We
will
not
,
”
cried
Albert
.
<EOS>
“
Bless
you
,
my
own
true
-
hearted
Ada
!
<EOS>
Atthe
very
moment
of
my
despair
<EOS>
,
I
have
been
,
as
it
were
,
lifted
toheaven
.
’
<EOS>
Tis
foolish
of
me
,
Ada
;
but
,
even
now
,
so
great
is
myhappiness
,
I
can
scarce
believe
it
real
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
drew
the
blushing
girl
again
to
his
throbbing
heart
.
<EOS>
He
kissed
theraven
tresses
of
her
silken
heart
.
<EOS>
He
looked
into
her
eyes
,
sparklingwith
dewy
tears
,
and
saw
the
happiness
that
shot
from
every
radiantglance
.
<EOS>
Her
cheek
,
gentle
and
soft
as
a
rose
-
bud
’s
inmost
leaf
,
touchedhis
—
was
there
ever
so
much
happiness
.
<EOS>
Could
all
the
ills
of
lifeconcentrated
,
poison
the
rich
fragrance
of
that
one
cup
of
overflowingjoy?We
will
not
attempt
to
record
the
gentle
confidences
of
the
happylovers
—
the
broken
sentences
—
the
speaking
glances
that
filled
up
thepauses
which
the
faltering
tongue
,
too
much
oppressed
by
the
heart’sgushing
eloquence
,
could
not
choose
but
make
the
tones
upon
whichmemory
in
after
years
lingers
like
the
shade
of
a
loved
one
long
hiddenin
the
tomb
,
nor
the
thousand
purest
vows
breathed
by
Albert
,
nor
thethousand
smiles
with
which
they
were
all
believed
by
Ada
.
<EOS>
Suffice
it
tosay
,
that
they
were
very
happy
,
and
those
of
our
readers
who
have
felta
sympathy
with
the
trials
of
the
lone
maiden
,
will
be
pleased
to
leaveher
for
a
brief
space
,
knowing
that
her
heart
is
dancing
with
joy
,
andthat
even
the
memory
of
the
past
is
emerged
in
the
pure
and
heavenlyenjoyment
of
the
present
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
’s
first
step
after
seeing
Ada
enter
the
room
inwhich
<EOS>
Albert
was
,
was
to
communicate
to
his
wife
all
that
had
passed
,
and
commission
her
to
explain
all
to
Albert
,
if
such
explanation
shouldbe
sought
for
before
his
return
,
for
he
felt
it
necessary
,
inconsequence
of
the
extraordinary
events
which
had
transpired
,
tocommunicate
to
his
impatient
friend
,
the
home
secretary
,
before
eventaking
steps
to
apprehend
Britton
and
Learmont
for
the
murder
of
Gray
,
which
upon
Albert
<EOS>
’s
testimony
he
felt
was
what
might
be
safely
venturedupon
.
<EOS>
The
magistrate
accordingly
left
his
house
,
and
proceeded
on
foot
to
thesecretary
’s
office
,
where
he
was
fortunate
enough
to
find
the
great
mandisengaged
.
<EOS>
“I
have
come
,
”
said
Hartleton
,
“
to
state
to
your
lordship
some
strangecircumstances
with
relation
to
the
person
named
Learmont
,
concerningwhom
<EOS>
I
have
before
had
the
honour
of
conversing
with
you
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
secretary
put
on
a
face
of
alarm
as
he
replied—“Really
?
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
,
you
must
drop
this
matter
<EOS>
—
his
majesty
has
onlythis
day
in
council
determined
upon
a
dissolution
of
the
presentparliament
—
of
course
I
tell
you
in
confidence
—
and
this
Learmont
’s
votesin
the
Commons
may
be
of
the
greatest
consequence
.
<EOS>
”“But
,
my
lord
,
”
said
Hartleton
,
“
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
thatno
later
than
last
night
he
committed
a
most
awful
murder
.
<EOS>
”“Dear
<EOS>
me
,
”
said
the
secretary
,
“
he
might
as
well
have
waited
till
thegeneral
election
was
over
.
<EOS>
It
is
really
such
a
very
awkward
thing
<EOS>
tohang
a
man
who
can
command
several
votes
in
the
Commons
.
<EOS>
”“It
<EOS>
may
be
so
,
”
said
Sir
Francis
,
with
a
smile
,
“
but
when
people
whocommand
votes
will
commit
murder
,
what
is
to
be
done?”“Ah
that
’s
very
true
;
but
uncommonly
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
thought
it
my
duty
,
”
continued
Hartleton
,
“
to
let
your
lordship
knowbefore
<EOS>
I
arrested
him
.
”“Bless
<EOS>
my
heart
,
”
said
the
secretary
,
“
now
I
recollect
there
has
been
arecord
here
to
-
day
containing
an
invitation
to
a
masked
ball
which
thisvery
man
is
going
to
give
on
Friday
.
”“Indeed
,
my
lord
.
<EOS>
”“Yes
.
<EOS>
I
sent
a
civil
acceptance
of
the
invitation
of
course
,
because
Imeant
to
sound
him
in
the
course
of
the
evening
about
his
votes
.
<EOS>
Nowreally
,
Sir
Francis
,
you
must
let
the
ball
be
over
before
you
come
inwith
your
charge
of
murder
,
and
so
on
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
will
if
your
lordship
pleases
;
but
the
property
of
Learmont
,
provided
he
be
convicted
of
murder
,
will
revert
to
the
Crown
,
in
whichevent
you
will
have
his
votes
.
”“Ah
,
but
,
my
dear
Sir
Francis
,
the
Crown
,
in
common
decency
,
must
waiveits
right
to
the
property
in
favour
of
the
next
of
kin
.
<EOS>
”“I
believe
there
can
arise
no
claimant
,
”
said
Sir
Francis
;
“
thereforethere
can
be
no
delicacy
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
”“Well
<EOS>
that
’s
lucky
—
but
you
will
let
the
ball
be
over
.
<EOS>
I
’m
told
it
’s
tobe
a
splendid
affair
,
and
really
so
many
of
our
political
friendsintend
to
make
it
a
complete
rendezvous
,
that
it
would
be
a
thousandpities
not
to
let
it
go
off
with
some
éclat
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
shall
,
of
course
,
not
interfere
,
my
lord
;
but
should
anything
occurto
force
a
magisterial
duty
,
I
trust
your
lordship
will
not
expect
meto
shrink
from
performing
mine
.
<EOS>
”“Well
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
not
,
but
do
n’t
be
provoking
,
Sir
Francis
,
if
you
canpossibly
avoid
it
.
<EOS>
By
-
the
-
by
,
I
quite
forgot
to
ask
who
he
hadmurdered
.
<EOS>
It
’s
nobody
of
any
consequence
,
I
presume?”“He
certainly
had
no
vote
.
<EOS>
”“No
<EOS>
vote?”“No
,
nor
was
likely
ever
to
have
one
.
”“Indeed
.
<EOS>
Well
,
I
do
hate
people
who
have
no
vote
most
cordially
,
and
Ishould
say
there
can
be
only
one
class
of
people
more
abominable
,
andthat
is
the
class
which
votes
against
one
.
<EOS>
I
do
n’t
at
all
<EOS>
see
the
usein
this
world
of
people
without
votes
.
<EOS>
How
uncommonly
silly
Learmontmust
have
been
,
really
.
”“Silly
<EOS>
enough
,
my
lord
,
to
put
his
neck
in
jeopardy
,
for
a
jury
willmost
naturally
bring
him
in
guilty
,
and
the
king
can
not
very
well
sparea
murderer
.
<EOS>
”“Why
no
,
not
exactly
<EOS>
;
but
at
all
events
do
n’t
say
a
word
about
it
tillafter
the
ball
.
”“Unless
<EOS>
there
should
arise
an
absolute
necessity
I
will
not
,
but
theinquest
upon
the
body
of
the
murdered
man
may
interfere
with
yourlordship

’s
wishes

”“Bless
<EOS>
me
,
yes
—
<EOS>
what
’s
to

day?”“Wednesday
.
”“Oh
,
well
,
I
must
speak
to
the
coroner
about
it
,
and
the
inquest
mustjust
be
put
off
till
Saturday
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
I
do
n’t
see
the
use
of
aninquest
upon
a
man
who
had
no
vote
,
Sir
Francis
;
but
I
suppose
thesethings
must
be
done
to
please
the
common
people
.
<EOS>
”“They
must
indeed
,
”
said
Sir
Francis
;
“
any
tampering
with
whatEnglishmen
consider
their
liberties
will
ever
be
a
dangerous
task
for
aminister
.
<EOS>
”“Ah
<EOS>
,
well
,
we
must
do
the
best
we
can
,
but
you
know
it
would
have
beenmuch
better
if
this
Learmont
,
while
he
was
murdering
,
had
murdered
someone
with
a
vote
who
was
opposed
to
us
.
<EOS>
It
might
have
made
a
differenceof
two
votes
you
see
,
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
”“So
<EOS>
it
might
,
your
lordship
;
but
when
people
murder
,
I
am
afraid
theythink
more
of
their
own
private
quarrels
than
of
votes
.
<EOS>
”“Ah
<EOS>
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
You
are
quite
right
—
<EOS>
good
morning
,
Sir
Francis

goodmorning

<EOS>
”“Good
<EOS>
morning
,
your
lordship
.
<EOS>
”Sir
<EOS>
Francis
Hartleton
could
not
help
laughing
as
he
walked
homewards
atthe
curious
morality
of
the
secretary
,
who
measured
everybody’simportance
by
their
number
of
votes
,
and
he
thought
to
himself
surelythis
system
of
representation
will
be
some
day
done
away
with
,
andEnglishmen
will
be
permitted
to
exercise
their
franchise
and
theirconscience
freely

Absorbed
then
in
meditation
concerning
the
importantsteps
which
required
to
be
taken
previous
to
the
Friday
evening
,
beyondwhich
time
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
was
quite
resolved
Learmont
should
notremain
at
liberty
,
he
sauntered
home
from
the
minister’s
.
<EOS>
Believing
,
as
the
magistrate
now
did

since
Jacob
Gray
was
dead
,
and
nowritten
papers
could
be
found
about
his

strangely
,

That
now
seems
to
be
the
only
chance
ofarriving
at
a
solution
of
the
mysteries
which
still

this

transaction

<EOS>
”When
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
reached
home
a
letter
was
put
into
his
hands
,
which
,
upon
opening
,
he
found
to
contain
these
words,—Mr

<EOS>
Learmont
presents
his
compliments
to
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
andbegs
specially
to
request
his
company
on
Friday
evening
,
to
a
maskedball
and
supper
.
<EOS>
“Well
,
”
said
Sir
Francis
,
“
of
all
the
cool
pieces
of
assurance
that
itwas
ever
my
lot
to
encounter
,
this
is
the
coolest
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
wellunderstand
Learmont
<EOS>
’s
<EOS>
feelings
now
;
he
fancies
himself
rid
of
somegreat
danger
by
the
death
of
Jacob
Gray
,
and
this
is
the
very
mockeryand
insolence
of
security
in
inviting
me
,
who
he
hates
so
cordially
,
tohis
entertainments
.
<EOS>
Well
,
be
it
so
<EOS>
,
I
will
be
there

<EOS>
Learmont

Yes

A

,
conjoined

”CHAPTER
<EOS>
CXI.The
Confession
.
<EOS>
While
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
was
still
engaged
in
these
reflections
alow
knock
sounded
on
the
door
of
his
room
,
and
when
he
cried
,
“
comein
,
”
the
happy
face
of
Ada
appeared
like
a
beam
of
sunshine
in
theentrance
.
<EOS>
“Ada
,
”
he
said
,
“
come
in
.
<EOS>
”There
were
the
humid
traces
of
tears
upon
her
cheek
,
but
they
were
likethe
pearly
drops
of
dew
which
hung
upon
the
rose
leaves
,
speaking
notof
sorrow
or
decay
,
but
giving
new
beauty
to
what
before
seemedmatchless
.
<EOS>
They
were
tears
of
joy
,
and
the
magistrate
saw
that
theywere
so
.
<EOS>
He
held
out
his
hand
to
Ada
,
as
he
said
with
a
smile,—“Will
<EOS>
you
forgive
me
for
tormenting
Albert
a
little?”“He
<EOS>
will
scarce
forgive
himself
,
”
said
Ada
,
“
and
sends
me
as
hisambassador
.
<EOS>
”“He
<EOS>
had
a
right
to
feel
a
little
angry
,
Ada
.
<EOS>
But
has
he
told
you
thatyour
old
enemy
is
<EOS>
dead?”“He
has
,
”
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“
Much
as
I
had
to
complain
of
against
Jacob
Gray
,
Iwould
that
he
had
come
to
some
gentler
death
.
<EOS>
Heaven
have
mercy
uponhim!”“He
has
need
of
heaven
’s
mercy
,
Ada
.
<EOS>
But
are
you
not
much
disappointedthat
all
chance
of
discovering
your
name
and
station
seems
now
fadedaway?”“I
scarcely
know
how
to
answer
you
,
”
said
Ada
,
“
for
hope
that
it
maynot
be
so
has
,
within
the
last
half
hour

disturbed
me
more

doubts

fearful

This
paper—”As
<EOS>
she
spoke
,
she
handed
to
Sir
Francis
the
confession
of
Gray

up
as
Albert
had
picked
it
from
the
garden
.
<EOS>
“Gracious
heavens
!
”
said
Sir
Francis
,
as
a
sudden
flush
of
colour
tohis
face
showed
the
interest
he
felt
in
the
document
,
“
where
got
youthis
,
<EOS>
Ada?”“When
Albert
,
impatient
of
his
temporary
detention
in
the
roomoverlooking
the
garden
,
”
said
Ada
,
“
made
an
attempt
to
escape
from
it
,
he
tried
to
descend
from
the
window
by
the
aid
of
a
cloak
,
which
rentwith
his
weight
,
revealing
this
packet
of
papers
addressed
to
you

<EOS>
”“Thus
<EOS>
heaven
works
its

said
Sir
Francis
;
“

,
that

You

<EOS>
”“Then
there
can
be
no

”
said
Sir
Francis
,
as
with
fingers
thattrembled
with
eagerness
he
broke
the
seals
by
which
the
packet
wasfastened—“there
can
be
no
doubt
that
these

”“Albert

”
said
Ada
,
“
and
longs
to

the
mysteryof

.
<EOS>
”“Will
<EOS>
you
leave

”
said
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
“
I
would
fain

Ada

<EOS>
Will
you
grant
me
that
indulgence?”Ada
rose
as
she
said,—“Dear

ever
be
a
command
to

butremember
that

I
can
bear
tohear
all

”“Nothing
<EOS>
shall
be
concealed
from
you
,
Ada
,
”
said
Sir
Francis
,
“
but
—
butmy
own
deeply
interested
feelings
would
not
permit
me
to
read
thesedocuments
aloud
to
you
at
first
.
<EOS>
”Ada
<EOS>
saw
his
extreme
excitement
and
agitation
,
and
instantly
leaving
theroom
,
she
gave
him
an
opportunity
of
reading
alone
the
long
sought
-
forconfession
of
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
’s
first
step
was
to
lock
himself
in
his
room
,
and
then
,
with
a
flurry
at
his
heart
,
and
a
total
abstraction
of
mind
fromeverything
but
the
papers
which
lay
before
him
,
he
tore
them
open
andread
as
follows:—To
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
I
,
Jacob
Gray
,
address
the
following
confession
and
statement
of
factsto
you
,
because
,
from
circumstances
within
your
own
remembrance
,
youwill
the
more
readily
believe
what
is
here
recorded
.
<EOS>
May
the
bitterestcurse
of
a
dead
man
fall
on
you
and
yours
if
you
do
not
take
instantmeans
to
bring
to
an
ignominious
end
those
who
I
shall
accuse
of
crimeswhich
shall
far
exceed
any
that
I
have
committed
.
<EOS>
By
the
time
youreceive
this
,
I
shall
most
probably
be
dead
,
or
have
left
England
forsome
distant
land
,
where
all
search
for
me
would
be
in
vain
.
<EOS>
I
leave
,
however
,
behind
,
whether
dead
or
absent
,
this
legacy
of
vengeance
,
andso
fulfil
a
promise
I
made
to
my
own
heart
to
destroy
those
who
wouldlong
since
have
murdered
me
,
but
that
I
had
fenced
myself
round
withsafeguards
which
they
dared
not
despise
.
<EOS>
In
the
year
1737
,
I
was
staying
at
Genoa
,
where
I
had
been
dischargedfrom
the
service
of
an
English
family
for
matters
of
no
consequence
tomy
present
narrative
.
<EOS>
For
some
months
I
could
procure
no
employment
,
until
an
English
gentleman
,
by
name
Mark
Learmont
,
was
taken
ill
at
oneof
the
hotels
in
the
city
,
and
the
proprietor
of
the
establishment
,
fearing
that
his
guest
was
dying
,
sent
for
me
as
a
countryman
of
thesick
gentleman
,
to
attend
upon
him
.
<EOS>
I
nursed
and
tended
him
withanxious
care
<EOS>
and
I
soon
learnt
that
grief
was
his
only
malady
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
he
had
left
England
in
consequence
of
the
death
of
his
wifeand
child
,
and
that
he
could
never
more
with
pleasure
look
upon
hisancient
home
again
,
which
he
had
left
in
the
care
of
his
brother
.
<EOS>
Time
,
however
,
seemed
in
some
measure
,
to
assuage
his
grief
;
and
when
he
gotwell
enough
again
to
travel
,
he
retained
me
as
his
permanent
attendant
,
liberally
rewarding
me
for
the
services
I
had
rendered
him
.
<EOS>
We
wentfrom
city
to
city
of
the
Italian
states
until
we
came
to
Rome
,
where
anattempt
was
made
by
some
hired
bravo
to
take
the
life
of
Mr.
Learmont
.
<EOS>
He
was
saved
,
however
,
by
the
gallant
interposition
of
a
young
Italiannobleman
,
named
Geronimo
Madelini
;
and
my
master
became
in
a
short
timeon
terms
of
the
greatest
intimacy
with
the
family
of
his
preserver
,
whohad
a
sister
so
surprisingly
beautiful
that
even
Mr.
Learmont
forgothis
grief
for
her
whom
he
had
loved
so
fondly
,
and
became
attached
toAda
Madelini
with
a
passionate
fervour
that
knew
no
bounds
.
<EOS>
Learmontwas
handsome
,
brave
,
and
accomplished
.
<EOS>
The
young
Italian
returned
hispassion
.
<EOS>
A
child
was
born
—
an
illegitimate
child
—
which
Ada
Madelini
diedin
giving
birth
to
.
<EOS>
Mr
.
<EOS>
Learmont
was
again
plunged
into
the
most
excessive
grief
.
<EOS>
Romebecame
more
hateful
to
him
than
the
home
in
England
he
had
left
;
thevery
language
of
Italy
was
ever
reminding
him
of
the
beautiful
beingwho
had
gone
to
an
early
grave
through
her
love
for
him
.
<EOS>
In
vain
hetravelled
from
city
to
city
.
<EOS>
His
grief
knew
no
reduction
,
until
atlength
,
wearied
with
travel
,
and
sick
at
heart
,
he
resolved
upon
oncemore
revisiting
his
native
land
,
taking
with
him
the
child
of
AdaMadelini
,
who
had
been
named
after
its
mother
,
and
who
had
begun
toexercise
a
strong
control
over
his
affections
.
<EOS>
A
letter
was
written
to
the
brother
,
who
had
been
left
sole
master
ofthe
estate
of
Learmont
,
signifying
the
intention
of
the
widowed
man
toreturn
,
and
once
more
assume
the
control
of
his
own
property
for
hisyoung
daughter
’s
sake
.
<EOS>
When
we
reached
Dover
,
that
is
,
Mr.
MarkLearmont
,
myself
,
and
his
infant
child
,
a
letter
was
awaiting
my
masterfrom
his
brother
.
<EOS>
That
letter
<EOS>
I
by
chance
saw
.
<EOS>
It
said
that
peculiarfamily
circumstances
,
which
the
writer
would
explain
when
they
met
,
rendered
it
necessary
that
their
first
meeting
should
be
a
secret
one
,
and
quite
unknown
to
any
person
connected
with
the
property
.
<EOS>
It
namedas
the
place
of
rendezvous
,
an
old
deserted
mansion
,
the
lower
part
ofwhich
was
converted
into
a
smithy
,
and
had
been
long
occupied
by
a
mannamed
Andrew
Britton
.
<EOS>
Full
of
wonder
at
this
letter
,
and
yet
never
doubting
that
there
were
,
did
he
but
know
them
,
full
and
reasonable
grounds
for
it
,
Mr.
Learmontwrote
to
his
brother
,
according
to
his
request
and
promising
to
be
atthe
Old
Smithy
with
his
child
,
by
the
evening
of
a
particular
day
,
which
he
named
.
<EOS>
He
sent
me
beforehand
to
apprise
his
brother
of
this
.
<EOS>
I
was
the
bearerof
the
answer
,
and
when
I
reached
Learmont
<EOS>
’s
house
,
he
that
is
nowcalled
Squire
Learmont
,
and
who
resides
in
your
immediate
vicinity
,
received
me
most
cordially
.
<EOS>
He
spoke
to
me
of
the
advantages
ofwealth
—
of
the
luxuries
of
independence
—
of
the
delightful
feelings
ofthose
who
could
scorn
the
world
’s
utmost
malice
—
secure
in
the
haven
ofindependence
—
<EOS>
but
it
is
idle
to
dwell
upon
the
deep
temptation
that
heheld
out
to
me
<EOS>
,
I
consented
to
the
murder
of
my
master
and
his
child!The
day
of
his
arrival
came
.
<EOS>
It
was
one
of
alternate
storm
andsunshine
;
but
,
as
the
evening
approached
,
the
elements
seemed
to
havebroken
loose
,
and
to
have
united
to
shake
the
very
earth
with
terror
.
<EOS>
The
wind
howled
,
and
the
forked
lightning
shot
from
earth
to
heaven
,
<EOS>
while
peal
after
peal
of
thunder
shook
the
habitations
of
thepeasantry
,
convulsing
the
stoutest
hearts
with
fear
,
and
destroying
allthe
produce
of
their
industry
.
<EOS>
It
was
on
such
a
night
,
that
,
leaving
Learmont
,
and
the
smith
AndrewBritton
in
the
smithy
,
I
started
to
meet
my
doomed
master
.
<EOS>
From
obscure
hints
the
smith
had
dropped
,
I
was
satisfied
that
Mr
.
<EOS>
Learmont
’s
first
wife
and
child
had
been
murdered
by
him
and
thebrother
,
and
even
after
I
had
consented
,
I
shuddered
at
the
awful
crimeI
had
pledged
myself
to
assist
in
committing
—
but
it
was
too
late
toretract
,
I
had
already
received
some
of
the
wages
of
crime
—
I
could
notrecede
.
<EOS>
But
surely
I
was
innocent
compared
with
who
would
shed
abrother
’s
blood
.
<EOS>
Let
him
suffer
the
penalty
of
his
crimes
—
let
the
richSquire
Learmont
dangle
on
the
gallows
tree
—
spare
him
not
,
nor
AndrewBritton
—
you
will
find
him
at
the
Old
Chequers
—
let
him
too
die
a
deathof
pain
and
ignominy
—
so
shall
I
have
my
revenge
—
my
deep
,
long
-
cherishedrevenge
.
<EOS>
I
met
Mr.
Learmont
.
<EOS>
He
alighted
from
the
carriage
,
which
he
left
at
adistance
of
a
mile
or
more
from
the
appointed
place
of
meeting
with
hisbrother
.
<EOS>
He
gave
me
the
young
child
to
carry
—
the
infant
Ada
,
and
wewalked
under
cover
of
the
darkness
of
the
stormy
evening
until
wereached
the
smithy
.
<EOS>
I
was
to
kill
the
child
,
while
Britton
took
thelife
of
the
father
;
but
one
thing
they
had
not
told
me
namely
,
thatthey
intended
to
burn
down
the
Old
Smithy
after
the
deed
was
done
,
inorder
that
the
two
bodies
should
be
consumed
in
the
ruins
,
and
nosuspicion
should
arise
of
their
untimely
fate
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
hour
to
me
of
horror
—
<EOS>
Mr
.
<EOS>
Learmont
entered
the
Old
Smithyunsuspectingly
,
and
I
followed
with
the
child
.
<EOS>
He
took
his
brotherkindly
by
the
hand
,
and
I
heard
him
say,—“Well
,
brother
,
<EOS>
what
is
amiss
,
that
we
can
not
meet
in
my
own
home!”“Come
<EOS>
this
way
,
Mark
,
”
said
he
who
is
called
the
squire
,
as
he
opened
aheavy
door
at
the
further
end
of
the
smithy
.
<EOS>
‘
Come
this
way
,
and
youwill
know
all
.
<EOS>
’Mr
.
<EOS>
Learmont
followed
him
,
and
I
went
after
them
with
the
child
.
<EOS>
It
wasclinging
to
my
neck
,
and
as
I
gazed
upon
its
features
,
by
theoccasional
flash
of
lightning
,
all
strength
seemed
to
desert
me
,
and
Ifelt
I
had
not
power
to
take
its
life,—I
thought
I
should
have
sunkinto
the
earth
—
a
fearful
timidity
came
over
me
,
and
the
coldperspiration
of
terror
bedewed
my
brow
.
<EOS>
I
scarcely
know
then
what
happened
,
but
the
storm
without
increased
totenfold
fury
;
and
while
the
smithy
was
being
set
fire
to
by
Learmont
,
the
squire
,
I
saw
by
the
dull
red
glare
that
began
to
spread
itselfaround
,
and
light
up
every
thing
with
its
ghastly
lustre
—
I
saw
mymaster
stagger
back
,
as
if
from
some
sudden
blow
,
and
the
smith
,
AndrewBritton
,
faced
my
gaze
,
armed
with
a
forge
hammer
,
<EOS>
with
which
he
hadalready
struck
one
blow
at
my
master
.
<EOS>
Mr
.
<EOS>
Learmont
then
tried
to
wrestle
with
his
opponent
and
he
screamed,“Murder
—
murder
.
”
<EOS>
He
called
too
on
me
to
help
him
,
but
I
could
not
move
.
<EOS>
I
saw
another
blow
given
,
and
I
heard
the
sickening
crushing
of
hishead
,
as
the
hammer
sunk
into
his
brain
—
and
then
he
fell
,
with
oneshriek
that
wrung
in
my
ears
,
for
many
months
,
scaring
me
from
sleep
,
and
causing
me
to
start
in
horror
from
my
bed
.
<EOS>
The
fire
had
spread
with
greater
rapidity
than
had
been
calculatedupon
,
and
at
the
moment
of
my
master
’s
murder
,
a
portion
of
the
rooffell
upon
me
and
the
child
—
I
was
hurt
,
but
the
infant
was
not
—
alarm
andhorror
took
possession
of
my
faculties
,
and
I
fled
,
shrieking
,
throughthe
house
,
seeking
for
some
outlet
to
escape
by
<EOS>
—
I
got
confused
in
alabyrinth
of
rooms
—
burning
flakes
fell
upon
my
flesh
—
I
cried
for
aid
,
but
no
voice
answered
me
,
and
I
felt
a
conviction
that
I
was
purposelyleft
there
to
perish
.
<EOS>
Despair
lent
me
strength
,
and
with
the
childstill
in
my
arms
,
I
leaped
a
burning
staircase
—
I
saw
a
crowd
of
facesbefore
me
,
and
,
with
frantic
cries
,
I
rushed
from
the
building
with
thechild
.
<EOS>
Who
,
then
,
snatched
the
infant
from
me
,
I
know
not
,
for
I
was
sufferingmuch
pain
;
but
certainly
it
was
taken
from
me
by
some
of
the
villagers
,
and
I
,
frantic
with
the
terrors
I
had
received
,
and
believing
that
thehand
of
Providence
was
upon
me
,
fled
I
knew
not
whither
,
until
I
sunkexhausted
from
fatigue
,
in
a
wood
a
short
distance
from
the
village
onthe
road
to
London
.
<EOS>
The
cool
night
air
assuaged
the
pain
of
my
burns
,
and
after
resting
forsome
hours
,
I
found
myself
sufficiently
recovered
to
think
upon
what
Ishould
next
do
.
<EOS>
Return
to
the
smithy
,
I
dared
not
,
for
I
dreaded
thevengeance
of
the
squire
,
not
only
on
account
of
my
failing
in
what
Ihad
to
do
,
but
I
could
not
dispossess
myself
of
the
idea
that
my
deathhad
been
determined
upon
,
between
him
and
the
smith
,
so
soon
as
I
hadkilled
the
child
,
and
was
no
longer
useful
to
their
purposes
.
<EOS>
I
hadreceived
,
in
advance
,
a
sum
of
money
from
my
tempter
,
Learmont
,
andafter
some
thought
I
resolved
upon
proceeding
to
London
,
and
thereendeavouring
to
forget
the
horrors
I
had
gone
through
,
in
the
variedamusements
of
a
great
city
.
<EOS>
I
turned
my
back
on
the
village
ofLearmont
,
and
all
its
terrible
recollections
,
taking
my
route
to
thecapital
by
the
quickest
means
I
could
find
.
<EOS>
It
was
on
the
second
day
that
I
arrived
,
and
resolving
to
husband
mymoney
until
I
could
procure
some
other
employment
<EOS>
,
I
took
an
obscurelodgings
and
kept
my
expenses
as
small
as
possible
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
fourth
evening
after
my
arrival
in
London
that
a
woman
,
whowas
sitting
upon
a
step
,
with
a
child
in
her
lap
,
implored
my
charity
.
<EOS>
I
refused
her
,
and
was
about
to
pass
on
,
when
a
glance
told
me
that
thechild
with
her
was
the
young
Ada
Madelini
,
the
child
of
Mr.
Learmont
;
Ipaused
,
and
questioned
her
.
<EOS>
She
told
me
her
name
was
Tattan
,
and
saidshe
had
fled
from
the
country
with
the
child
,
to
save
its
life
,
whichhad
been
threatened
by
a
man
,
wicked
and
powerful
.
<EOS>
All
this
confirmedme
—
I
snatched
the
child
from
her
arms
,
for
I
thought
it
an
admirablepossession
,
since
it
would
give
me
the
means
of
making
my
own
terms
,
atsome
future
time
,
with
the
Squire
of
Learmont
.
<EOS>
The
woman
screamed
and
ran
after
me
,
crying
for
help
.
<EOS>
No
one
was
nearus
,
and
with
one
blow
I
silenced
her
,
and
she
fell
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Whatbecame
of
her
I
never
knew
,
but
I
took
the
child
home
with
me
,
and
thenext
day
I
changed
my
lodging
,
passing
the
infant
as
my
own
.
<EOS>
From
house
to
house
I
shifted
my
residence
,
always
thinking
myselfsuspected
by
some
one
,
until
I
went
to
reside
at
a
low
house
,
kept
by
awoman
,
by
name
Strangeways
,
who
resided
in
the
neighbourhood
ofSwallow
-
street
.
<EOS>
Before
going
there
,
however
,
I
bought
boy
’s
<EOS>
clothingfor
the
girl
,
as
I
thought
it
safer
to
make
her
appear
as
a
boy
thanlet
her
real
sex
be
known
.
<EOS>
Nearly
ten
years
had
elapsed
,
and
I
wasfalling
fast
into
poverty
,
for
a
concern
in
which
I
had
placed
somemoney
,
under
tempting
promises
,
proved
a
failure
.
<EOS>
Then
I
bethought
meof
some
means
of
improving
my
condition
,
and
recruiting
my
emptycoffers
.
<EOS>
After
much
thought
,
I
resolved
upon
going
to
the
village
of
Learmont
,
and
forming
a
coalition
if
possible
,
with
the
smith
,
Andrew
Britton
,
for
the
purpose
of
extorting
money
from
the
rich
squire
.
<EOS>
But
previouslyto
going
I
wrote
a
paper
,
containing
all
the
particulars
here
related
,
and
sealing
it
<EOS>
,
I
left
it
with
Ada
,
who
I
had
named
,
in
conformity
withher
male
attire
,
Harry
,
charging
her
to
let
it
reach
the
hands
ofyourself
in
the
event
of
my
not
returning
by
a
stipulated
time
.
<EOS>
I
wenton
my
errand
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
the
winter
,
and
the
snow
lay
thickly
in
thevalley
of
Learmont
;
as
I
reached
the
village
<EOS>
inn
<EOS>
I
inquired
if
thesmith
,
Britton
,
was
still
alive
;
I
was
told
he
was
,
and
heard
then
theclank
of
his
forge
-
hammer
,
the
same
most
probably
that
had
taken
thelife
of
Mr.
Learmont
.
<EOS>
I
sought
him
,
and
suffice
to
say
,
that
I
not
onlyconvinced
him
of
the
inexpediency
of
attempting
aught
against
my
life
,
which
,
as
I
guessed
he
would
be
,
he
was
much
inclined
to
do
,
butsucceeded
in
inducing
him
to
join
with
me
in
extorting
large
sums
fromthe
guilty
squire
.
<EOS>
Britton
,
too
,
I
persuaded
to
search
the
body
of
the
murdered
man
,
when
,
as
I
told
him
,
he
found
papers
of
great
consequence
to
thesquire
—
papers
which
he
would
gladly
have
redeemed
at
any
price
,
butwhich
were
of
infinitely
more
value
as
a
source
of
permanent
income
totheir
fortunate
holder
.
<EOS>
I
had
lent
the
smith
a
knife
of
mine
at
his
own
request
before
themurder
,
and
when
I
visited
him
he
produced
it
,
<EOS>
stained
with
human
gore
,
taunting
me
with
the
fact
that
my
name
was
on
the
handle
,
and
that
itwould
ever
prove
a
damning
evidence
of
my
guilt
.
<EOS>
’Twas
were
we
three
men
in
each
other
’s
power
.
<EOS>
Either
Britton
or
myselfcould
bring
the
whole
three
to
destruction
,
and
the
squire
was
but
tooglad
to
ensure
his
own
safety
by
paying
large
sums
to
us
from
time
totime
.
<EOS>
He
came
to
London
,
and
we
followed
him
.
<EOS>
Andrew
Britton
led
alife
,
as
he
now
leads
,
of
riot
and
extravagance
,
at
the
public
-
housecalled
the
Chequers
,
Westminster
.
<EOS>
The
Squire
Learmont
lives
insplendour
,
as
you
must
be
aware
,
in
your
immediate
vicinity
.
<EOS>
I
have
leda
life
of
dangers
and
terror
.
<EOS>
My
existence
has
been
continuallythreatened
by
Learmont
,
who
,
could
he
at
any
time
have
laid
his
handsupon
Ada
,
who
he
believed
to
be
legitimate
,
and
likewise
have
securedmy
written
confession
,
would
have
murdered
me
.
<EOS>
I
repeat
,
I
may
be
dead
,
or
absent
from
England
,
when
you
arrive
;
butbe
it
which
way
<EOS>
it
may
,
if
you
want
proofs
of
what
I
assert
,
search
theruins
of
the
Old
Smithy
at
Learmont
,
and
you
may
still
find
some
tracesof
the
murdered
body
of
Mr.
Mark
Learmont
.
<EOS>
Apprehend
Andrew
Britton
,
and
search
for
the
knife
<EOS>
,
I
mention
,
as
well
as
for
any
papers
that
hemay
have
taken
from
the
dead
body
.
<EOS>
Among
them
will
be
found
the
letterfrom
the
squire
,
begging
his
brother
to
meet
him
at
the
Old
Smithy
,
instead
of
coming
direct
to
his
own
mansion
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
understood
by
you
,
then
,
clearly
,
that
I
accuse
these
twomen
,
Squire
Learmont
and
Andrew
Britton
,
of
the
murder
of
Learmont’selder
brother
,
and
the
projected
murder
of
his
illegitimate
child
.
<EOS>
She
,
Ada
,
left
me
some
time
since
,
after
an
attempt
made
by
you
to
take
meinto
custody
at
the
old
house
at
Battersea
Fields
,
among
the
ruins
ofwhich
<EOS>
I
believe
you
will
still
find
some
articles
that
belonged
to
Adawhen
her
father
’s
death
occurred
.
<EOS>
Let
,
then
,
these
men
be
brought
to
an
ignominious
end
.
<EOS>
Remember
thatthe
Learmont
family
will
become
extinct
with
the
present
squire
,
forthe
girl
Ada
<EOS>
,
I
repeat
,
is
an
illegitimate
child
.
<EOS>
The
elder
Learmontand
Ada
Madelini
were
not
married
.
<EOS>
The
large
estates
,
then
,
must
revertto
the
crown
,
and
my
vengeance
will
be
complete
.
<EOS>
If
I
am
living
,
Ishall
hear
of
the
execution
of
Learmont
and
Britton
;
for
who
can
doubttheir
guilt
?
<EOS>
If
I
am
dead
,
and
the
spirits
of
the
departed
retain
anyshadow
of
the
feelings
which
agitated
them
in

CHAPTER
CXII.The
Consultation
with
Albert
and
Ada.—The
Arrangement
for
the
Ball
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
finished
the
confession
of
Gray
,
Sir
Francis
Hartletonlooked
up
and
drew
a
long
breath
.
<EOS>
An
inexpressible
feeling
of
reliefcame
over
him
,
and
he
cried,—“It
is
as
I
partly
expected
.
<EOS>
Ada
is
related
to
this
squire
nearly
.
<EOS>
Withregard
to
her
alleged
illegitimacy
,
I
do
not
believe
it
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
The
malice
of
Jacob
Gray
,
for
denouncing
him
in
the
open
street
,
isfully
sufficient
to
account
for
his
making
such
an
assertion
.
<EOS>
That
,
however
,
is
a
fact
which
can
be
very
easily
ascertained
;
and
I
have
nota
shadow
of
doubt
but
my
beautiful
young
friend
,
after
all
her
severetrials
and
persecutions
,
will
become
the
possessor
of
the
splendidestates
of
Learmont
,
and
will
be
able
to
reward
the
constancy
of
herlover
with
a
princely
income
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
what
a
relief
it
is
,
after
all
,
tofind
that
Jacob
Gray
can
not
claim
the
least
shadow
of
kindred
with
Ada
.
<EOS>
Well
,
he
has
gone
to
his
account
;
and
,
although
I
have
no
moral
doubtin
the
world
of
the
guilt
of
Britton
and
Learmont
as
regards
<EOS>
Ada’sfather
<EOS>
,
yet
this
paper
would
be
very
insufficient
evidence
to
proceedupon
.
<EOS>
If
they
suffer
the
penalty
of
the
law
for
murder
,
it
will
be
forthat
of
Jacob
Gray
himself
.
<EOS>
”Sir
<EOS>
Francis
Hartleton
then
left
his
room
,
after
locking
up
Gray’sconfession
,
and
hastened
to
where
he
had
left
Albert
.
<EOS>
The
good
-
heartedmagistrate
will
be
excused
by
our
fair
readers
for
forgetting
that
inall
probability
Ada
,
when
she
had
left
him
,
had
gone
back
to
Albert
,
and
that
,
consequently
,
when
he
,
Sir
Francis
,
opened
the
door
veryabruptly
,
the
beautiful
girl
was
just
,
to
the
smallest
possible
extentannoyed
,
to
be
seen
with
Albert
’s
hand
clasped
in
her
own
,
and
such
asmile
of
joy
on
her
face
,
that
her
lover
thought
himself
in
heaven
,
and
,
at
all
events
,
would
have
challenged
any
one
to
produce
aheartfelt
joy
equal
to
that
which
then
filled
him
with
thankfulness
.
<EOS>
“My
dear
Ada
,
”
said
Sir
Francis
,
“
I
have
to
apologise
.
<EOS>
”Ada
rose
,
and
while
a
blush
spread
itself
over
her
face
,
she
said,—“Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
how
can
Albert
and
myself
find
words
,
to
tellyou
how
much
we
owe
to
you
,
our
noble
,
considerate
,
generous
friend
.
<EOS>
What
would
have
become
of
the
poor
destitute
,
desolate
Ada
,
but
<EOS>
foryou?”“And
I
,
sir
,
”
said
Albert
,
while
a
tear
glistened
in
his
eye
,
“
<EOS>
I’mafraid
I
have
offended
you
past
all
forgiveness
.
<EOS>
”“No
<EOS>
such
thing
,
”
said
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
“
You
know
I
was
very
provokingindeed
,
Mr.
Seyton
;
but
Ada
,
my
dear
,
go
and
fetch
Lady
Hartleton
,
forshe
must
hear
what
I
have
to
tell
you
.
<EOS>
”Ada
<EOS>
looked
in
his
face
a
moment
,
to
read
by
his
expressive
features
thecharacter
of
the
intelligence
he
had
gleaned
from
Gray
’s
<EOS>
confession;and
<EOS>
the
magistrate
shaking
his
head
,
said
playfully,—“Now
,
Ada
,
that
is
too
bad
;
”
but
the
smile
with
which
he
accompaniedhis
words
assured
her
that
what
he
had
to
say
was
not
the
worst
thatcould
be
under
the
circumstances
anticipated
,
and
she
flew
to
LadyHartleton
to
come
and
join
the
group
.
<EOS>
When
they
were
all
assembled
Sir
Francis
<EOS>
said,—“What
<EOS>
I
now
tell
you
must
remain
in
our
own
breasts
until
Saturday
.
<EOS>
Ada
,
I
shall
commence
with
one
piece
of
intelligence
,
which
will
notdisplease
you
,
and
I
am
sure
remove
one
occasionally
disagreeablethought
from
your
mind
—
Jacob
Gray
is
not
in
the
remotest
degreeconnected
with
you
by
the
ties
of

.
”“Thank
<EOS>
Heaven
!
”
said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“Now
<EOS>
then
,
my

Ada
,
I
counsel
you
to
hear
,
with
a
patientresignation
,
the
will
of
Providence
,
when
I
tell
you
you
are
an
orphan
.
<EOS>
”One
<EOS>
sob
burst
from
Ada
’s
breast
<EOS>
,
for
she
had
always
pleased
herselfwith
the
idea
of
some
day
finding
a
dear
mother
or

That
dreamwas
now
dispelled
,
and
it
was
with
some
difficulty
she
could
<EOS>
say,—“Heaven

be
done

<EOS>
I
should
not
mourn
,
for
have
I
not
found
allthe

continued
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
“

a
noble

honourable
gentleman

your

a

of
wealth

”“Go
<EOS>
on

”
gasped
Ada
,
while
Albert
Seyton
and
Lady
Hartletonlooked
the
intense
interest
they
felt
in
Sir
Francis
’s
words
.
<EOS>
“Will
you
not

Ada

”
he
added
,
“
be
now
content
with
knowing
so
much

deeper
into

<EOS>
”“Tell
<EOS>
me
more
of
my

she
sobbed
.
<EOS>
“
Oh

me
notto

”“I

Sir

clasping
her

”“Your

a

the
avarice

”Ada
<EOS>
shuddered
,
and
as
the
tears
rapidly
coursed
each
other
down
hercheeks
,
she
said
,
in
a
low

plaintive
tone,—“Tell

with

taken
by
three
men

Andrew
Britton

the
third—”Sir
Francis
Harleton
paused
,
and
Ada
filled
up
the
blank
with
thewords,—“Jacob
Gray

”“True
,
”
said
the
magistrate
;
“
Jacob
Gray
was
,
it
appears
,
by
his
ownconfession
,
a
confidential
servant
of
your
father

was
subornedby
your
wicked
and
most
unnatural
uncle

commit
the
crime

at
allevents

aid
in
its
commission

which
,
for
so
many
years
,
plunged
him
inall
the
miseries
of
a
guilty
conscience

placed
you
in
the
singularcircumstances

you
have
been

so
recently
rescued

”“And

Albert

so
speciously
taught

the
stout

Andrew

<EOS>
You
were
made
a
mere
tool

assist
in
the
destruction
ofJacob
Gray
,
who
,
no
doubt
,
was
troublesome
on
account
of
his
rapacity
,
and
dangerous
on
account
of
the
written
confession
he
kept
by
him

andwhich

has
so
providentially

strangely
fallen
into
my

<EOS>
”Albert
<EOS>
Seyton
looked
perfectly
petrified
with
astonishment
for
a
time
.
<EOS>
Then
,
in
a
voice
of
emotion
,
he
said,—“Oh
,
Heaven
,
how
near
was
I
proving
your
worst
enemy

most

<EOS>
”“I
can
scarcely

said
Ada
.
<EOS>
“
You
must
relateeverything

Is
this

dark

with
a

like
paleness?”“He

”
said
Albert
.
<EOS>
“And
<EOS>
he
is
my

’s
brother?”“I
grieve
to
say
that
such
is
the
fact

said
Sir

Hartleton
.
<EOS>
“The

must
take
cognisance
of

the
only

besatisfactorily

against

<EOS>
A
word
with
you
,
Mr.
Seyton
.
<EOS>
”While
Ada
sat
with
her
hand
clasped
in
that
of
Lady
Hartleton
,
who
wasstriving
to
soothe
the
agitated
spirits
of
the
gentle
girl
,
Sir
Francistook
Albert
to
the
window
,
and
said,—“Gray
,
in
his
confession
,
asserts
the
illegitimacy
of
Ada
,
but
from
allthat
I
have
ever
heard
of
the
character
of
the
elder
Learmont
,
as
wellas
from
the
evidently
anxious
manner
in
which
Gray
has
repeatedlystated
the
circumstance
,
I
much
doubt
its
truth
.
<EOS>
It
is
quite
necessary
,
however
,
that
such
a
point
should
be
satisfactorily
set
at
rest
,
or
weshall
have
difficulty
in
procuring
for
Ada
her
father
’s
property
,
whichhas
been
so
long
withheld
from
her
by
this
squire
,
as
he
has
falselycalled
himself
.
<EOS>
The
family
of
Ada
’s
mother
can
surely
be
easily
found
,
and
I
think
some
one
must
be
instantly
despatched
to
Italy
,
where
Adawas
born
,
in
order
to
prosecute
the
necessary
inquiries
.
”“Oh
,
Sir
Francis
,
”
said
Albert
,
his
countenance
beaming
with
pleasure;“let
<EOS>
them
say
what
they
like
of
Ada
,
she
is
to
me
the
whole
world

<EOS>
Withher
I
can
be
happy
as
the
day
is
long
,
and
I
am
sure
we
shall
neversigh
for
the
wealth
,
the
possession
of
which
could
not
make
our
heartsmore
true
to
each
other
than
they
are
now
.
<EOS>
”“Yes
,
my
dear
sir
,
”
said
Sir
Francis
,
with
a
smile
,
“
I
quite
agree
withyou
that
you
may
make
yourselves
very
happy
indeed
,
in
a
humblerstation
of
life
than
that
in
which
I
have
hopes
of
placing
Ada
;
but
itis
but
common
justice
that
she
should
possess
what
is
hers
of
right
.
<EOS>
The
Learmont
property
is
immense
.
<EOS>
”Albert
sighed
.
<EOS>
“Why
<EOS>
,
what
’s
the
matter
now
?
”
said
Sir
Francis
,
good
-
humouredly
.
<EOS>
“Can
<EOS>
I
expect
,
”
said
the
young
man
,
“
that
Ada
Learmont
,
the
richheiress
,
should
give
her
hand
to
the
poor
,
destitute
Albert
Seyton?”“Oh
<EOS>
,
I
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
,
”
exclaimed
the
worthy
magistrate,“you
must
settle
all
that
between
you
.
<EOS>
Ada
,
I
wish
you
to
give
anopinion
on
a
very
knotty
point
raised
by
Albert
Seyton
.
”Before
<EOS>
Albert
Seyton
could
interpose
,
Ada
approached
the
window
,
andSir
Francis
<EOS>
added,—“You
must
know
,
Ada
,
that
Mr.
Seyton
is
of
opinion
that
if
he
were
toget
immensely
rich
,
his
feelings
would
alter
as
regards
his
affectionsfor
one
poor
and
dependent
.
<EOS>
”“Good
<EOS>
God
,
Sir
Francis
,
”
said
Albert
,
“
I
never
said
any
such
thing!”“Then
<EOS>
it
was
Ada
’s
feelings
which
were
to
alter
,
provided
she
was
richand
you
poor
.
<EOS>
”Albert
<EOS>
looked
abashed
,
and
Ada
said
in
a
gentle
voice
to
him,—“Is
this
kind
,
Albert?”“No
,
Ada
,
“
he
said
.
<EOS>
“
It
is
foolish
and
wrong
.
<EOS>
Forgive
the
scruple
thatrose
up
in
my
mind
of
still
urging
my
suit
to
you
when
,
as
I
hear
fromSir
Francis
Hartleton
<EOS>
you
are
likely
to
become
very
wealthy
.
<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
did
such
a
thought
cross
your
mind
,
Albert
,
”
said
Ada
,
sadly,“when
<EOS>
you
stood
between
little
Harry
Gray
and
him
who
is
now
nomore
—
when
you
spent
days

nights
of
anxious
toil

did
then
a

affection

sprang
up

well

Francis
quietly
walked
away
from
the
window
,
leaving
Albert
to
makehis
peace
<EOS>
how
he
could
;
which
it
is
to

did

CHAPTER
CXIII.Learmont
and
Britton
after
the
Murder
.
<EOS>
Having
devoted
so
large
a
space
to
the
hopes
,
the
fears
,
the
surprises
,
and
the
joys
of
those
in
whose
happiness
,
and
freedom
from
thedistresses
and
persecutions
which
surrounded
them
,
we
are
so
largelyinterested
,
we
turn
with
a
sensation
of
sickening
gloom
to
the
two
menof
blood
.
<EOS>
Learmont
and
the
savage
smith
,
after
they
had
satedthemselves
with
gore
,
and
like
ferocious
tigers
of
the
jungle
,
cameslinking
from
the
feast
of
blood
which
they
had
sought
with
avidity
,
and
tasted
of
so
greedily
.
<EOS>
Neither
of
them
spoke
after
they
reached
the
street
-
door
of
Gray’shouse
,
until
they
had
placed
several
streets
between
them
and
the
onein
which
the
awful
deed
was
committed
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
dogged
,
apathetic
kind
of
movement
and
manner
aboutBritton
,
as
with
a
heavy
tread
he
slowly
walked
by
the
side
of
thesquire
,
which
more
resembled
the
gross
serenity
of
some
over
-
gorgedreptile
than
anything
else
.
<EOS>
Never
before
had
the
smith
’s
appetite
fordestruction
been
so
thoroughly
sated
—
<EOS>
never
before
had
he
accomplished
adarling
wish
of
his
heart
so
fully
and
so
completely
.
<EOS>
His
hatred
ofJacob
Gray
had
been
one
of
his
chief
passions
for
years
,
and
he
hadalways
pleased
himself
with
the
notion
of
some
day
having
a
revengewhich
should
be
in
accordance
with
his
savage
nature
,
and
full
ofterror
.
<EOS>
Yet
in
his
wildest
dreams
—
in
his
most
fanciful
imaginings
ofwhat
he
would
like
to
do
to
Jacob
Gray
<EOS>
,
he
had
fallen
short
of
thescene
of
horror
and
blood
<EOS>
he
had
that
night
gone
through
.
<EOS>
Yes
;
AndrewBritton
was
satisfied
—
quite
satisfied
,
as
regarded
Jacob
Gray
,
and
hefelt
all
the
ennui
and
satiety
which
was
sure
to
arise
,
when
the
greatobject
which
he
had
always
pleased
himself
he
should
one
day
be
able
toaccomplish
,
was
done
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Gray
was
dead
.
<EOS>
He
had
died
by
his(Britton
’s
)
hands
an
awful
death
,
such
as
rejoiced
him
to
inflict
,
andwhich
was
only
disagreeable
because
it
was
done
,
and
could
not
berepeated
.
<EOS>
Now
and
then
he
would
cast
a
scowling
glance
upon
the
squire
,
as
if
helonged
to
strike
him
down
with
the
cleaver
he
still
held
in
his
grasp
.
<EOS>
He
felt
like
a
man
,
the
great
object
of
whose
existence
has
slippedaway
from
him
,
leaving
the
mind
no
fixed
point
upon
which
to
fall
backin
thought
.
<EOS>
“Curses
on
him
!
”
<EOS>
he
muttered
.
<EOS>
“
He
’s
dead
,
”
and
Britton
felt
himselfalmost
injured
that
Gray
could
not
be
brought
to
life
again
in
order
<EOS>
togive
him
again
the
pleasure
of
dashing
Bond
’s
cleaver
into
hisquivering
brain
.
<EOS>
But
what
were
these
thoughts
of
the
coarse
-
minded
,
brutal
animal
,
Britton
,
in
comparison
with
the
whirl
-
wind
of
frightful
feelings
thatmade
a
hell
in
the
seething
brain
of
Learmont
.
<EOS>
If
he
looked
up
to
thesky
,
huge
gouts
of
blood
seemed
to
intercept
his
view
of
the
blue
vaultof
heaven
;
if
he
cast
his
eyes
downwards
,
he
could
not
divest
himselfof
the
idea
that
he
was
treading
in
ensanguined
pools
of
human
gore
.
<EOS>
Heground
his
teeth
together
till
he
produced
a
resemblance
of
thecrashing
sound
which
the
cleaver
wielded
by
Britton
had
made
as
it
camein
contact
with
the
crunched
bones
of
Gray
’s
skull
.
<EOS>
His
last
despairingcry
of
“
Mercy
—
mercy
—
mercy
!
”
<EOS>
was
still
ringing
in
his
ears
,
and
,
finally
,
such
was
the
intense
excitement
of
his
feelings
,
that
he
wascompelled
to
lean
upon
the
arm
of
Britton
as
he
gasped,—“I
—
<EOS>
I
—
shall
go
mad
—
I
shall
go
mad
.
<EOS>
Andrew
Britton
,
get
me
some
water
tocool
my
brain
.
<EOS>
I
shall
go
mad!”“Water
<EOS>
be
d
—
d
!
”
<EOS>
growled
Britton
;
“
have
some
brandy
,
why
,
what
’s
thematter
<EOS>
now?”“Do
—
do
you
not
hear
,
Britton
?
<EOS>
Gray
is
still
screaming
for
mercy
—
<EOS>
doesnot
the
sound
rush
like
burning
lava
through
your
brain
—
hark
—
hark
—
<EOS>
hestill
shrieks
mercy
—
mercy
—
mercy
.
<EOS>
”Learmont
held
the
smith
by
the
arm
as
he
spoke
,
and
trembled
soespecially
that
he
shook
the
bulky
form
of
Britton
to
and
fro
.
<EOS>
“Why
<EOS>
what
’s
come
over
you
,
squire
?
”
<EOS>
cried
Britton
,
“
curse
you
—
<EOS>
you
arenot
going
to
make
a
die
of
it
now
,
just
as
that
canting
thief
Gray
isput
out
of

.
”“Oh
,
Britton
—
Britton
<EOS>
,
was
it
not
horrible?”“No

it
was
n’t

head
with
a
cleaver

youdo
for

at

and
all
you
get
out

<EOS>
Come

Come

Learmont
;

which
have
already
left
their
brand
upon
my
soul
.
<EOS>
”“Ha
—
ha
—
ha
,
”
laughed
Britton
,
“
<EOS>
now
I
will
have
some
fun
with
the
squire
.
<EOS>
Don’t
you
recollect
knocking
your
brother
Mark
<EOS>
’s
first
baby
on
thehead
,
squire?”“Peace
—
peace
—
fiend
,
”
gasped
Learmont
.
<EOS>
They
had
now
reached
the
door
of
a
small
public
-
house
,
which
was
keptopen
usually
all
night
for
the
convenience
of
thieves
and
watchmen
,
when
Britton
pulled
Learmont
across
the
threshold
to
the
little
bar
,
where
a
man
sat
smoking
with
imperturbable
gravity
and
placidity
.
<EOS>
“Brandy
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Britton
,
as
he
reached
over
the
bar
,
and
snatched
thepipe
from
the
man
,
throwing
it
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
The
man
was
one
of
those
slow
thinkers
,
who
are
some
time
comprehendinganything
—
so
he
merely
stared
at
Britton
,
out
of
two
exceedingly
smalleyes
,
that
were
nearly
buried
in
mountains
of
flesh
.
<EOS>
“Brandy
!
”
<EOS>
again
cried
Britton
,
as
he
gave
the
front
of
the
bar
aclanging
blow
with
the
flat
part
of
the
cleaver
,
that
made
every
bottledance
again
,
and
so
astonished
the
potman
,
that
he
slid
from
his
chair
,
and
sat
on
the
ground
,
looking
first
at
Britton
,
and
then
at
Learmont
,
with
as
much
alarm
depicted
in
his
countenance
,
as
it
could
depict
,
considering
it
was
by
no
means
well
calculated
for
portraying
humanfeelings
.
<EOS>
If
the
potman
’s
mind
was
rather
overcome
by
the
sudden
abstraction
ofhis
pipe
,
the
blow
upon
the
bar
with
the
cleaver
completed
amystification
which
to
all
appearance
,
looked
as
if
it
would
last
aconsiderable
time
;
so
Britton
,
perceiving
a
little
half
door
leadingwithin
the
bar
,
on
the
swing
,
entered
,
without
any
ceremony
,
and
layingviolent
hands
on
the
first
quart
pot
he
saw
,
he
drew
liquor
from
everytap
in
succession
that
came
to
hand
,
until
he
had
filled
the
measurewith
a
combination
of
strong
spirits
,
of
which
he
took
a
long
draught
,
and
then
handed
it
across
to
Learmont
,
who
stood
holding
himself
up
bythe
bar
,
and
but
slightly
conscious
of
where
he
was
,
or
what
Brittonwas
doing
.
<EOS>
“Here
<EOS>
,
”
cried
the
smith
,
“
drink
some
of
that
.
<EOS>
”Learmont
took
the
quart
measure
,
and
lifted
it
to
his
lipsmechanically
,
he
drank
some
of
the
contents
,
and
then
handed
it
back
toBritton
,
who
,
after
pouring
the
remainder
on
the
fat
landlord
’s
head
,
gave
him
a
thump
with
the
measure
,
saying
.
<EOS>
“That
’s
to
clear
your
wits
,
and
if
you
say
that
two
gentlemen
have
beenhere
with
a
cleaver
.
<EOS>
I
’ll
come
back
some
day
,
and
smash
you
.
<EOS>
”With
<EOS>
this
Britton
hustled
Learmont
out
of
the
house
,
and
in
about
threequarters
of
an
hour
the
fat
landlord
said,—“Bless
us
,
and
save
us!”Learmont
<EOS>
was
half
intoxicated
with
the
draught
of
spirits
he
had
taken
,
when
he
reached
his
own
door
-
step
,
to
which
he
was
conducted
byBritton
,
who
said
to
him,—“Now
,
squire
<EOS>
you
are
home
again
,
and
that
job
’s
<EOS>
jobbed
;
Jacob
Graywon’t
trouble
you
any
more
,
and
as
for
his
confession
,
why
I
begin
tothink
as
you
do
,
that
there
never
was
one
.
”“Ah
,
the
confession
—
the
confession
!
”
<EOS>
gasped
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“
We
are
lost
—
weare
lost
,
Britton
—
if
,
after
all
,
there
should
be
one
found
.
<EOS>
”“Go
<EOS>
to
the
devil
,
”
said
Britton
,
as
he
shook
himself
free
of
thesquire
,
and
flourishing
the
cleaver
proceeded
on
his
way
to
theChequers
.
<EOS>
The
first
person
that
Britton
encountered
on
his
road
home
was
aparticularly
slow
-
moving
watchman
,
whom
he
levelled
at
once
with
athwack
between
the
shoulders
,
inflicted
with
the
flat
part
of
thecleaver
.
<EOS>
Then
,
when
he
reached
the
Chequers
,
it
was
a
greatsatisfaction
to
him
to
find
the
door
shut
,
because
it
gave
him
anopportunity
of
taking
the
heavy
cleaver
in
both
hands
,
and
bringing
itdown
with
a
blow
upon
the
lock
that
on
the
instant
smashed
it
,
andburst
the
door
wide
open
to
the
great
consternation
of
the
landlord
,
who
immediately
hid
himself
below
the
bar
,
and
only
peered
up
when
heheard
Britton
’s
voice
exclaim,—“Curse
you
<EOS>
all!—Where
<EOS>
are
you
?
<EOS>
Boil
me
some
brandy
,
I
say
,
or
I’llsmash
everything
in
the
place
.
”“Oh
,
dear
,
your
majesty
!
<EOS>
So
you
’ve
come
home
,
”
faltered
the
landlord;“dear
me!”Britton
’s
<EOS>
only
reply
to
this
conciliatory
speech
was
to
throw
thecleaver
at
the
landlord
’s
head
,
who
only
escaped
it
by
ducking
in
time
,
when
it
flew
over
him
,
smashing
some
dozens
of
glasses
,
and
producing
anoise
and
confusion
within
the
bar
that
was
quite
gratifying
toBritton
’s
feelings
.
<EOS>
“Hilloa
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Bond
,
when
he
saw
Britton
enter
the
parlour
.
<EOS>
“
Here
haveI
been
waiting
for
you
,
I
do
n’t
know
how
long
.
<EOS>
”“Who
told
you
to
wait
?
”
<EOS>
roared
Britton
.
<EOS>
“Nobody
,
”
shouted
Bond
,
in
as
high
a
tone
.
<EOS>
“
Where
’s
my
cleaver?”“In
the
bar
.
<EOS>
Did
n’t
you
hear
it?”“Ha
!
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
Ha
!
”
<EOS>
laughed
the
butcher
,
“
I
did
hear
a
smash
.
<EOS>
You
are
a
greatgenius
,
Britton
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
have
you
settled
that
fellow
,
<EOS>
eh?”“What
’s
<EOS>
that
to
you?”“Oh
?
<EOS>
Nothing
,
I
only
asked
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
was
one
too
many
for
you?”“Too
many
for
me
!
<EOS>
I
’ve
smashed
him!”“Very
good
,
”
said
Bond
,
resuming
his
pipe
with
an
air
of
greatcomposure
.
<EOS>
In
the
meanwhile
Learmont
was
lighted
by
his
wondering
domestics
to
hisown
chamber
.
<EOS>
They
had
never
before
this
seen
him
in
such
a
state
ofphysical
prostration
;
and
,
but
that
they
were
in
too
great
fear
of
hisviolence
to
offer
him
even
a
kindness
they
would
have
assisted
him
upthe
staircase
,
for
they
saw
that
he
was
scarcely
capable
of
ascendingalone
,
and
had
to
clutch
to
the
banisters
nervously
for
support
.
<EOS>
When
he
reached
his
chamber
,
he
sank
into
a
chair
,
and
after
a
fewmoments
,
he
said,—“More
lights
—
more
lights
!
<EOS>
Let
me
have
more
lights
here
.
<EOS>
The
place
isdark
.
<EOS>
“One
of
the
servants
lit
the
wax
candles
which
were
in
silver
sconces
onthe
mantel
-
shelf
,
and
then
humbly
inquire
if
his
worship
had
anyfurther
orders
to
give
.
<EOS>
“None
—
none
!
”
said
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“
None
!
<EOS>
Why
do
you
stare
at
me
so
?
<EOS>
Is
—
isthere
blood
upon
me
?
<EOS>
How
dare
you
look
upon
me
with
eyes
of
suspicion?”The
servants
looked
at
each
other
in
surprise
and
terror
,
and
slowlyslunk
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
“Let
<EOS>
me
have
wine
—
wine
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“
Wine
to
give
me
new
blood
,
for
,
by
the
God
of
heaven
<EOS>
,
what
I
have
is
freezing
in
my
veins
.
<EOS>
Wine
—
wine
<EOS>
,
I
say!”They
brought
him
wine
,
and
a
massive
silver
goblet
to
drink
it
from;but
when
they
did
so
<EOS>
,
they
found
him
resting
his
head
upon
the
table
,
and
apparently
half
-
asleep
,
for
he
was
moaning
occasionally
,
andmuttering
the
words,—“Mercy
—
mercy
<EOS>
—
mercy!”None
dared
to
arouse
him
,
but
lifting
up
their
hands
in
silent
terror
,
they
gently
closed
the
door
,
and
crept
softly
down
the
staircase
,
leaving
him
alone
with
his
dark
and
awful
thoughts
.
<EOS>
The
sun
was
lighting
up
the
east
,
and
the
dim
clouds
of
night
wererapidly
changing
their
inky
hue
for
the
glorious
tints
of
day
;
butthere
sat
Learmont
still
with
his
head
upon
the
table
,
and
the
glare
ofthe
many
wax
lights
he
had
ordered
,
strangely
mingling
with
the
roseatetints
of
the
coming
day
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
what
awful
images
of
horror
and
despair
came
marching
in
dismaltroops
through
the
brain
of
the
blood
-
guilty
man
.
<EOS>
Over
and
over
againwas
the
fearful
tragedy
he
had
been
an
actor
in
,
exhibited
to
hisshrinking
imagination
.
<EOS>
Then
he
fancied
himself
alone
with
the
mangledbody
of
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
His
feet
were
rooted
to
the
floor
of
the
room
,
andhe
thought
the
body
rose
,
while
Gray
,
with
his
long
,
ghastly
-
lookingfingers
dabbled
in
blood
,
strove
to
hold
his
eyes
in
their
sockets
—
toreplace
the
splintered
pieces
of
his
fractured
skull
,
the
while
heglared
at
him
,
Learmont
,
with
such
a
look
of
stony
horror
,
that
with
ashriek
the
squire
awoke
,
and
stood
in
his
chamber
a
picture
of
guiltyhorror
,
staring
with
blood

eyes
at

CHAPTER
CXIV.Albert
’s
Visit
to
Learmont.—The
Squire
’s
Triumph
.
<EOS>
After
a
time
Learmont
became
more
conscious
of
his
situation
,
and
afeeling
of
exhaustion
coming
over
him
in
consequence
of
the
fatigue
,
both
of
body
and
mind
he
had
undergone
,
he
partially
divested
himselfof
his
apparel
,
and
throwing
himself
upon
the
luxurious
bed
which
wasin
the
room
,
he
soon
dropped
into
a
deep
sleep
,
which
was
not
visitedand
rendered
hideous
by
any
of
the
frightful
images
which
had
beforebeen
conjured
up
by
his
oppressed
brain
.
<EOS>
It
was
some
four
hours
or
more
before
he
again
awakened
,
and
then
hefound
himself
much
refreshed
both
bodily
and
mentally
.
<EOS>
He
ran
over
inhis
mind
accurately
all
the
circumstances
of
his
present
position
,
andnow
that
his
cooler
judgment
had
sway
,
and
the
horror
of
the
recentevents
he
had
passed
through
was
beginning
to
subside
<EOS>
,
he
inclined
moreand
more
to
his
previously
expressed
opinion
,
that
Jacob
Gray
had
notreally
written
any
confession
,
but
had
merely
pretended
to
have
such
adocument
always
at
hand
,
for
the
purpose
of
aweing
him
and
saving
his
,
Jacob
’s
life
,
from
any
attempt
on
the
part
of
either
of
his
greatenemies
.
<EOS>
Learmont
rose
and
paced
his
room
in
deep
thought
,
and
then
,
while
hestood
as
it
were
upon
a
mine
,
which
,
did
he
but
know
it
,
was
ready
toexplode
beneath
him
,
and
hurl
him
to
destruction
;
a
feeling
ofself
-
satisfaction
began
to
creep
over
him
,
and
he
re
-
assured
himselfinto
a
belief
that
he
must
have
materially
bettered
his
situation
bythe
destruction
of
Gray
.
<EOS>
“It
must
be
so
,
”
he
muttered
.
<EOS>
“
There
is
no
confession
written
,
and
Graywas
not
only
a
heavy
expense
,
but
would
,
no
doubt
,
some
day
have
playedsome
serious
trick
in
payment
for
the
attempts
which
,
to
his
knowledge
,
had
been
made
against
him
.
’
<EOS>
Tis
<EOS>
well
,
then
,
he
is
dead
—
exceedinglywell
,
for
my
worst
enemy
is
gone
.
<EOS>
Britton
will
drink
himself
to
death
,
surely
;
and
as
for
the
pretended
papers
he
has
,
of
such
greatconsequence
to
me
,
as
he
and
Gray
ever
affected
they
were
,
<EOS>
I
now
beginto
think
that
like
Jacob
Gray
’s
written
confession
such
a
tale
ismerely
invented
as
a
bugbear
to
my
imagination
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
must
be
now
in
abetter
,
a
far
better
position
,
and
the
day
will
come
,
when
I
shall
haveno
further
fear
of
the
stability
of
my
fortunes
.
<EOS>
”Reasoning
<EOS>
thus
,
he
argued
himself
into
a
more
placid
mode
,
and
then
thedark
feelings
of
hate
,
revenge
,
and
gloomy
triumphs
,
which
,
for
a
time
,
had
been
overpowered
and
forced
to
hide
their
diminished
heads
inconsequence
of
his
great
excitements
,
once
more
rose
,
phœnix
like
,
fromtheir
ashes
,
and
the
wild
scheming
,
blood
-
stained
villain
smiled
,
as
heglanced
round
him
upon
the
magnificence
with
which
he
was
surrounded
,
and
which
he
thought
would
soon
be
all
his
own
,
without
the
shadow
offear
being
cast
over
them
.
<EOS>
“By
<EOS>
the
powers
of
hell
!
”
<EOS>
he
cried
,
“
I
will
still
let
them
see
that
Ican
live
right
royally
in
my
noble
halls
.
<EOS>
When
last
I
met
the
Ministerof
State
,
methought
he
looked
strangely
at
me
,
and
he
certainly
did
,
upon
some
most
shallow
and
slight
excuse
,
put
me
off
when
I
spoke
of
mybaronetcy
,
promised
as
it
has
been
for
so
long
.
<EOS>
That
magistratetoo
—
that
Hartleton
,
who
I
so
deeply
hate
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
sneer
,
too
,
uponhis
face
when
I
saw
him
last
,
as
if
he
would
have
said,—‘Learmont
,
yourfate
is
hurrying
on
,
and
I
shall
triumph
over
you
.
’
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
My
bestsense
of
security
lies
in
the
fact
that
he
leaves
me
alone
.
<EOS>
Could
hebut
get
up
the
shadow
of
a
charge
against
me
,
how
gladly
would
hestrive
to
blacken
me
and
my
fame
in
the
eyes
of
those
who
,
despite
him
,
will
yet
heap
honours
on
my
head
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Harleton
,
I
know
you
wellas
my
active
enemy
,
and
while
I
am
unmolested
by
you
,
I
am
safe
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
will
persevere
,
most
certainly
,
in
my
intention
of
giving
a
fête
onSaturday
,
which
shall
surpass
,
in
richness
and
magnificence
,
any
thathave
yet
been
vaunted
highly
by
my
crowds
of
visitors
—
visitors
whom
Idespise
,
but
yet
find
useful
as
tools
to
work
out
my
great
scheme
ofambition
.
<EOS>
”Learmont
<EOS>
then
rung
for
his
servants
,
and
with
a
malignant
pleasurecaused
the
cards
of
invitation
to
his
grand
masked
ball
for
theSaturday
to
be
sent
to
Hartleton
and
to
the
minister
.
<EOS>
“I
will
vex
the
very
soul
of
this
Hartleton
,
”
he
said
,
“
by
the
gorgeousdisplay
of
wealth
I
will
make
.
<EOS>
”A
<EOS>
shade
of
care
then
suddenly
came
across
his
brow
,
as
for
the
firsttime
since
his
departure
from
the
house
of
Gray
,
he
thought
upon
thepromised
visit
of
Albert
Seyton
.
<EOS>
“Ha
,
”
he
cried
,
“
my
young
secretary
,
I
had
nearly
forgotten
him
.
<EOS>
Willhe
prove
troublesome
?
<EOS>
Did
he
catch
a
glimpse
of
me
at
Gray’s?No
—
no
—
that
he
did
not
—
and
if
he
did
—
well
.
<EOS>
The
shortest
plan
ofoperation
with
regard
to
him
is
to
give
him
more
hopes
,
no
matter
howslenderly
based
;
and
along
with
them
a
cup
of
wine
,
which
shall
containan
insidious
drug
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
will
poison
him
,
and
then
send
him
some
longerrand
to
a
distant
part
of
the
country
,
which
he
will
never
live
toreturn
from
—
a
safe
way
—
a
most
safe
way
.
<EOS>
So
shall
I
be
rid
of
himwithout
the
—
the
—
horror
(
Learmont
shuddered
as
he
spoke
)
of
seeing
suchanother
death
,
perhaps
,
as
that
I
would
fain
blot
from
my
memory
forever
,
but
which
rises
gaunt
and
bloody
ever
before
my
mental
eye
.
<EOS>
Imust
not
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
My
fête
—
my
brilliant
fête
—
my
baronetcy
—
ah

thoseare
grateful
imaginings

<EOS>
”The
receipt
of
Learmont
’s
card
of
invitation
to
Sir
Francis
Hartletonwe
are
already
aware
of
,
and
in
the
course
of
the
day
its
presence
,
asit
lay
before
him
gave
the
magistrate
an
idea
,
which
,
if
it
could
besuccessfully
carried
out
,
would
have
some
time
in
the
apprehension
<EOS>
ofthe
guilty
squire
,
as
well
as
,
in
all
probability
,
force
some
suddenrecognition
of
Ada
and
her
rights
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
it
was
,
at
all
events
,
important
,
that
,
as
he
,
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
had
given
his
promise
tothe
Secretary
of
State
that
Learmont
should
not
be
molested
until
afterthe
Saturday
’s
fête
,
the
squire
should
not
be
led
to
suspect
that
anyof
his
plans
had
failed
,
or
that
any
immediate
danger
beset
him
.
<EOS>
For
the
purpose
of
preventing
such
a
thing
from
occurring
,
Sir
FrancisHartleton
proposed
to
Albert
Seyton
that
he
should
see
Learmont
on
thatevening
,
in
pursuance
of
the
arrangement
which
had
been
entered
intobetween
him
and
the
squire
.
<EOS>
Another
difficulty
,
or
rather
a
doubt
,
beset
this
line
of
proceeding
,
however
,
and
that
was
to
know
whether
the
squire
was
aware
,
or
not
,
ofthe
fact
of
Albert
having
been
present
at
the
house
in
which
Gray
wasmurdered
on
the
night
,
or
rather
morning
,
of
that
event
.
<EOS>
To
solve
thisquestion
,
or
,
at
all
events
,
to
render
it
an
innocuous
one
,
Sir
FrancisHartleton
advised
that
Albert
should
take
with
him
to
the
squire
’s
anexact
copy
of
the
confession
of
Jacob
Gray
,
and
hand
it
to
him
,
admitting
that
,
seeing
the
door
of
Gray
’s
house
open
,
he
had
enteredand
become
possessed
of
the
document
by
the
accidental
tearing
of
acloak
in
which
it
was
concealed
.
<EOS>
“Such
<EOS>
a
step
on
our
parts
,
”
said
Sir
Francis
,
“
must
have
the
effect
ofthoroughly
disarming
Learmont
of
all
suspicion
of
his
danger
;
and
sincehis
friend
,
the
Secretary
of
State
,
has
him
so
much
under
his
specialprotection
,
on
account
of
his
parliamentary
influence
,
I
should
likevery
much
to
let
him
see
,
personally
,
what
a
beautiful
protégé
he
has
,
and
make
the
masked
ball
the
scene
of
his
apprehension
.
<EOS>
”“I
am
quite
willing
to
act
upon
your
advice
,
”
said
Albert
;
“
and
indeed
,
I
am
not
a
little
curious
and
anxious
to
know
<EOS>
what
Learmont
canpossible
say
to
me
this
evening
,
when
I
call
upon
him
,
and
demand
Ada
,
according
to
the
solemn
promises
he
made
me
.
<EOS>
”With
<EOS>
this
understanding
<EOS>
Albert
and
the
magistrate
repaired
to
the
studyof
the
latter
,
where
they
took
an
accurate
copy
of
the
confession
,
which
Albert
placed
in
his
pocket
,
while
Sir
Francis
charged
himselfwith
the
preservation
of
the
original
.
<EOS>
“Return
as
soon
as
possible
,
”
said
Sir
Francis
,
“
and
,
above
all
things
,
be
mindful
of
treachery
.
<EOS>
”“I
think
I
am
more
than
a
match
for
the
squire
,
”
said
Albert
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
“Be
<EOS>
that
as
it
may
,
”
said
the
magistrate
,
“
remember
that
during
yourstay
at
his
house
there
will
be
a
force
within
hearing
of
you
shouldyou
require
any
assistance
.
<EOS>
We
must
trust
this
man
of
many
crimes
aslittle
as
we
possibly
can
.
<EOS>
”Without
<EOS>
saying
anything
to
Ada
of
his
intention
,
for
he
knew
that
heranxiety
would
be
very
great
if
she
knew
that
he
was
venturing
into
thehouse
of
Learmont
,
Albert
,
just
as
the
shades
of
evening
began
to
fallupon
the
streets
and
house
left
the
residence
of
the
magistrate
,
<EOS>
andproceeded
at
a
sharp
pace
towards
Learmont
’s
<EOS>
splendid
abode
.
<EOS>
He
was
readily
admitted
,
and
upon
being
shown
into
the
room
where
heusually
saw
Learmont
,
he
found
him
seated
with
a
multitude
of
papersbefore
him
,
apparently
very
busily
engaged
.
<EOS>
He
started
as
he
sawAlbert
,
and
yet
he
felt
intensely
gratified
,
for
it
tended
much
toassure
him
of
his
safety
.
<EOS>
His
only
difficulty
consisted
in
his
want
ofknowledge
of
whether
Albert
had
seen
him
or
not
at
Gray’s
.
<EOS>
“You
are
true
to
your
appointment
,
Mr.
Seyton
,
”
he
said
,
after
a
fewmoments
thought
.
<EOS>
“
Have
you
heard
any
news
of
Jacob
Gray?”“He
is
murdered
,
”
said
Albert
.
<EOS>
Learmont
turned
a
shade
paler
as
he
said,—“So
<EOS>
I
have
heard
this
morning
,
and
that
has
,
I
fear
,
placed
an
obstaclein
your
way
.
<EOS>
”“I
found
that
he
was
murdered
,
”
continued
Albert
“
at
an
early
hour
thismorning
.
<EOS>
Being
anxious
concerning
her
<EOS>
whom
I
loved
I
passed
the
housein
which
Gray
resided
,
when
I
saw
the
door
ajar
.
<EOS>
That
excited
mycuriosity
,
and
I
entered
from
an
impulse
which
I
could
not
control
.
<EOS>
”“He
<EOS>
did
not
see
me
,
”
thought
Learmont
;
“
he
suspects
nothing
.
<EOS>
”“I
called
aloud
upon
Ada
,
”
continued
Albert
,
“
but
no
one
answered
me
.
<EOS>
Procuring
then
a
light
from
a
woman
in
the
house
,
I
proceeded
to
searchit
,
and
found
Gray
a
mangled
horrible
corpse
.
<EOS>
”Learmont
drew
a
long
breath
as
he
said,“I
heard
so
much
this
morning
from
a
casual
visitor
,
and
I
wasintending
before
now
to
take
with
me
a
warrant
from
the
Secretary
ofState
which
would
have
been
granted
upon
my
applications
to
take
Grayinto

,
and
offer
the
young

you
have
made

<EOS>
”“You
are
very
considerate

”
said
Albert
.
<EOS>
“
By
the
accidentalrending
of
a
cloak
which
I
presume
belonged
to
Jacob
Gray
,
a
packet
ofpapers—”Learmont
uttered
a
loud
cry
,
and
rising
,
he
stretched
out
his
hands
,
saying
,
while
his
face
was
livid
with
apprehension,—“You

you

them

<EOS>
The

The

<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
shook
like
an
aspen
leaf
as
he
pushed
the
cup
of
wine
he
haddrugged
,
in
case
he
should
wish
to
get
rid
of
Albert
,
<EOS>
towards
him
,
andhis
voice
grew
hoarse
with
anxiety
as
he
continued
to
say,—“The
papers
—
the
papers!”Albert
handed
him
the
copy
of
Gray
’s
confession
,
which
Learmontsnatched
with
the
most
frantic
eagerness
.
<EOS>
“You
<EOS>
see
,
Mr.
Seyton
<EOS>
,
”
he
said
,
“
I
am
most
anxious
about
the
welfare
ofyourself
and
this
young
maiden
—
I
pray
you
drink
.
<EOS>
The
wine

good

<EOS>
Yes
,
this
is
addressed
to
Sir

,
but
it
is
far
better

<EOS>
She

<EOS>

<EOS>
”There
was
something
about
Learmont
’s
extreme
eagerness
to
induce
him
todrink
that
excited
the
suspicious
of
Albert
,
and
he
resolved
that
hewould
not
touch
a
drop
of
wine
,
but
having
executed
his
errand
,
wouldget
out
of
the
house
as
quickly
as
possible
.
<EOS>
Learmont
rose
as
he
spoke
,
still
grasping
the
document
Albert
had
givenhim
in
his
hand
,
and
said,—“Wait
for
me
a
short
time
;
I
will
read
this
most
carefully
,
and
thencommunicate
to

the

<EOS>
I
pray

<EOS>
You

<EOS>
”With
<EOS>
an
expression
of
triumph
upon
his
brow
,
and
a
haughtier
,
firmertread
than
he
had
used
for
years
<EOS>
,
Learmont
left
the
room
,
with
,
as
hesupposed
,
the
confession
of
Jacob
Gray
in
his
possession
,
and
AlbertSeyton
disposed
of
,
as
he
thought
he
would
be
,
by
partaking
of
thedrugged
wine
,
he
then
considered
he
should
have
no
further
troubleconcerning
Ada
,
except
what
might
easily
be
overcome
.
<EOS>
Before
he
returned
to
Albert
,
the
latter
had
cast
the
wine
from
thewindow
,
and
when
Learmont
glanced
at
the
goblet
,
and
saw
it
was
empty
,
he
said,—“Mr
.
<EOS>
Seyton
,
I
have
read
the
paper
;
it
says
that
your
Ada
,
yourmuch
-
loved
Ada
,
is
an
orphan
,
and
that
you
will
find
her
at
—
at
—
Chatham
.
”“At
<EOS>
Chatham
,
sir?”“Yes
,
off
with
you
.
<EOS>
You
must
inquire
for
the
residence
of
a
Mr

Henderson

<EOS>
He
is
well
known

and
will
conduct
you

<EOS>
Off
with
you
,
and
come
back
to
me
—
when
you
can

”
<EOS>
These
last
words
were
uttered
afterAlbert
,
who
was
disgusted
with
the
scene
,
had
hurried
from
the
room
.
<EOS>
Then
Learmont
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
,
and
cried,—“He
will
be
dead
within
an
hour
!

CXV.The
Masked
Ball
.
<EOS>
How
singularly
different
the
various
actors
in
our
eventful
drama
<EOS>
ofreal
life
passed
the
Thursday
and
the
Friday
preceding
Learmont’smasked
ball
.
<EOS>
To
the
squire
himself
it
was
a
period
of
restlessinquietude
,
for
even
in
his
moments
of
self
-
exaltation
,
and
triumphantcongratulation
,
there
was
bitterness
at
his
heart
,
and
he
could
almostfancy
a
voice
<EOS>
said
to
him
in
a
hissing
whisper—“This
is
not
real
.
”
<EOS>
Hadit
not
been
for
the
great
preparations
he
occupied
himself
in
makingand
superintending
for
the
approaching
entertainment
,
his
imagination
,
having
more
leisure
to
brood
upon
the
past
,
would
have
brought
upon
himgreater
suffering
than
he
really
endured
,
but
,
as
it
was
,
each
hourthat
had
winged
its
flight
,
he
told
himself
that
he
was
safer
still
,
and
that
he
had
now
little
more
to
do
than
enjoy
the
discomfiture
ofhis
enemies
.
<EOS>
That
Albert
Seyton
had
died
of
the
poison
which
he
,
Learmont
,
thought
he
had
taken
,
he
entertained
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
The
onlycircumstance
that
surprised
him
much
was
that
he
had
not
seen
Britton
,
but
having
ascertained
,
upon
inquiry
,
that
the
smith
had
not
been
onedegree
removed
from
helpless
intoxication
since
the
Wednesday
morning
,
he
felt
satisfied
,
and
rather
pleased
than
otherwise
,
at
the
speedydestruction
which
Britton
must
be
making
of
his
powers
of
existence
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
with
what
malignant
satisfaction
he
read
and
re
-
read
,
as
hesupposed
,
the
only
document
which
could
have
hurled
him
from
his
highestate
to
destruction
,
to
death
,
to
infamy
!
<EOS>
How
he
laughed
with
a
wilddemoniac
mirth
at
the
simplicity
of
Albert
Seyton
in
handing
him
theconfession
,
and
being
so
easily
put
off
from
a
knowledge
of
itscontents
.
<EOS>
With
what
a
proud
air
he
trod
his
splendid
saloons
,
and
howhaughtily
he
reasoned
with
himself
about
that
Providence
which
he
inhis
wild
excitement
of
fancied
success
almost
considered
he
hadcircumvented
.
<EOS>
“This
ball
,
”
he
muttered
,
“
shall
be
the
scene
of
my
triumph
and
thediscomfiture
of
my
enemies
<EOS>
—
envy
shall
become
more
envious
,
humility
andsycophancy
more
humble
and
cringing
—
for
all
shall
see
that
the
star
ofLearmont
is
in
the
ascendant
.
<EOS>
Then
,
this
confession
,
addressed
to
SirFrancis
Hartleton
,
shall
make
assurance
doubly
sure
;
I
will
totallyconfound
him
by
handing
to
him
a
document
of
my
own
contrivancesimilarly
addressed
,
but
with
contents
most
widely
differing
from
this!Yes
,
it
shall
be
done
.
<EOS>
With
seeming
candour
and
simplicity
the
subtlestplots
are
carried
out
,
the
deepest
designs
concluded
successfully
.
<EOS>
Whatwill
be
the
result
?
<EOS>
All
that
I
can
wish.—I
will
write
a
supposedconfession
of
Jacob
Gray
,
and
hand
it
to
this
active
magistrate
.
<EOS>
”For
<EOS>
some
moments
<EOS>
Learmont
was
so
delighted
with
this
plan
,
<EOS>
that
hepaced
the
saloon
in
which
he
was
in
silence
,
while
a
grim
smile
lit
uphis
face
,
giving
him
a
close
resemblance
to
some
of
those
strange
oldcarvings
,
which
modern
fashion
,
if
not
modern
taste
,
is
rescuing
fromthe
dust
and
oblivion
of
centuries
at
the
present
day
.
<EOS>
In
silent
meditation
he
concocted
his
plan
,
which
he
considered
wouldeither
place
Ada
in
his
power
,
or
force
the
magistrate
in
a
verydisagreeable
position
,
for
the
mock
confession
he
meant
to
write
,
andhand
to
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
as
having
been
brought
to
him
by
hissecretary
,
he
intended
should
merely
contain
an
appeal
to
his
,
Learmont
’s
,
charity
in
favour
of
the
orphan
girl
.
<EOS>
While
triumph
was
thus
setting
on
the
brow
of
Learmont
—
while
Heaven
wasinflating
his
heart
with
the
vanity
of
success
,
as
if
but
to
make
hisfall
more
awful
,
Ada
,
who
we
have
followed
through
her
various
fortunesso
long
,
was
indeed
happy
in
the
best
,
the
purest
,
acception
of
theterm
.
<EOS>
Her
joy
was
not
the
feverish
excitement
arising
from
successfulmachinations
.
<EOS>
It
was
heavenly
serenity
—
<EOS>
the
sunny
happiness
of
a
heartwhich
knew
no
guile
,
and
was
only
too
much
blessed
in
being

and
unpersecuted
to
follow
out

Hartleton
,
seemed
to
share
inthe
satisfaction
that
there
abounded
,
from
what
cause
they
knew
not
,
but
they
were
satisfied
,
from
the
smiles
of
Ada
and
the
returningcolour
on
her
cheek
,
the
evident
happiness
of
Albert
Seyton
,
and
thepleasure
which
sparkled
in
the
eyes
of
their
master
and
mistress
,
thatsomething
must
have
happened
to
bring
great
joy
among
them
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
Saturday
morning
before
Britton
had
the
least
interval
ofsobriety
,
and
then
so
stultified
were
his
faculties
with
the
debauch
ofthe
last
two
days
,
far
exceeding
as
it
did
any
that
he
had
previouslyindulged
in
,
that
he
was
some
time
in
comprehending
what
Bond
thebutcher
meant
,
when
,
after
repeated
howlings
in
his
ear
,
he
heard
himsay—“Britton
,
curse
you
,
you
beast
,
the
squire
,
your
rich
friend
,
<EOS>
is
goingto
give
a
ball
to
-
night
,
I
hear
,
and
all
the
people
are
to
go
,
theytell
me
,
with
masks
.
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
,
you
brute?”“Yes
,
and
be
hanged
to
you
;
you
are
as
drunk
as
you
can
be
,
and
youknow
it
,
”
responded
Britton
.
<EOS>
“
More
brandy
—
more
brandy
!
<EOS>
Damn
JacobGray
—
no

curse
it
,
<EOS>
it
’s
no

damning
Jacob
Gray
any
more
now
<EOS>
:
he’sdamned
already
—
damn
everybody
.
”“Ah
,
Master
Britton
,
”
exclaimed
a
man
who
had
just
entered
the
Chequerswith
a
determination
of
enjoying
a
pipe
,
and
a
quart
of
ale
,
and
agrumble—“we
live
in
hard
times
,
Master
Britton
—
are
we
to
have
our
headssmashed
—
are
we
to
have
our
throats
cut
—
are
we
to
be
murdered
in
ourbeds
—
are
we—”“I
tell
you
<EOS>
what
,
”
said
Bond
,
“
if
you
come
any
more
of
your
‘
are
we’s,’I’ll
just
throw
you
out
of
the
window
.
”“Throw
<EOS>
me
out
of
the
window
?
<EOS>
pooh
!
<EOS>
I
sit
here
on
the
liberty
of
thesubject
,
and
what
I
mean
to
say
is
,
that
everything
is
smotherednow
-
a
-
days
.
<EOS>
Here
’s
been
two
murders
,
and
they
’ve
both
been
smotheredup
.
<EOS>
There
was
poor
Mr.
Vaughan
’s
murder
—
who
ever
heard
anything
ofthat
,
I
should
like
to
know
?
<EOS>
Then
there
’s
been
the
murder
of
Mr.
Gray
,
a
most
mysterious
affair
;
and
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
who
prides
himselfso
much
upon
his
being
such
an
active
magistrate
,
<EOS>
he
doesnothing
—
nothing
,
my
masters
,
I
may
add
,
nothing
.
”“Smash
<EOS>
him
!
”
<EOS>
said
Britton
,
and
Bond
,
immediately
rising
,
would
haveprobably
done
some
serious
mischief
,
had
not
the
man
,
who
,
by
good
luckwas
near
the
doors
taken
alarm
in
time
,
and
rushed
out
crying
,
‘
Murder’until
he
was
met
and
pacified
by
the
landlord
,
who
persuaded
him
to
sitdown
in
the
bar
while
he
sneaked
into
the
parlour
to
fetch
his
pipe
andale
.
<EOS>
Just
as
the
landlord
entered
the
room
,
Britton
shouted
to
him
in
ahalf
-
drowsy
<EOS>
tone,—“Hark
<EOS>
you
;
mind
<EOS>
my
sedan
-
chair
is
ready
to

night
.
<EOS>
I
’m
going

ball

”“Bless
<EOS>
your
majesty
—
are
you
really
!
<EOS>
I
never!”“Didn’t
you
,
”
said
Britton
,
as
he
flung
the
fire
-
shovel
at
thelandlord
’s
,
head
,
who
made
a
precipitate
retreat
without
the
ale
andthe
pipe
,
which
articles
,
rather
than
again
venture
into
the
parlour
,
he
again
supplied
to
the
talkative
man
.

By
one
hour
after
sunset
,
Learmont
had
the
various
lamps
andchandeliers
lit
in
his
splendid
mansion
,
and
with
feelings
somewhatakin
to
those
with
which
he
had
first
made
a
tour
from
room
to
room
,
heglanced
around
him
upon
the
rare
magnificence
with
which
he
wascompletely
surrounded
.
<EOS>
“’Tis
well
—
exceedingly
well
,
”
he
muttered
.
<EOS>
“
I
have
suffered
much
tobring
about
such
a
night
of
triumph
as
this
.
<EOS>
Within
some
few
briefhours
three
hundred
of
the
highest
and
the
noblest
in
this
country
willbe
assembled
in
my
halls
,
while
I
,
the
observed
of
all
observers
,
dothe
honours
of
my
costly
home
.
<EOS>
To
-
night
I
will
claim
a
fulfilment
ofthe
minister
’s
promise
concerning
the
baronetcy
.
<EOS>
To
-
night
,
in
softwhispered
accents
,
will
I
once
more
essay
to
win
the
hand
of
the
proudbeauty
<EOS>
whose
ancient
patrician
name
will
add
a
lustre
to
my
own
too
newnobility
.
<EOS>
This
is
indeed
a
night
of
triumph
!
<EOS>
I
ought
to
be
happy
.
”
<EOS>
Evenas
he
spoke
,
such
a
pang
shot
across
his
heart
,
that
he
absolutelyreeled
again
,
and
when
he
could
speak
,
he
said
in
faltering
accents,—“What
—
what
means
this
emotion
?
<EOS>
Why
do
I
tremble
now
?
<EOS>
What
have
I
tofear?—Nothing
—
nothing.—What
<EOS>
can
happen?—Oh
nothing!—I
am
safe
—
verysafe
!
<EOS>
I
wish
my
company
would
come
.
<EOS>
I
like
to
hear
the
hum
of
life
inmy
glorious
abode!—I
<EOS>
like
to
see
the
moving
plumes!—I
like
to
note
thediamond
’s
glittering
presence!—I
wish
they
would
come
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whereand
how
Albert
Seyton
died?—The
poison
he
took
was
subtle!—He
could
notescape
—
that
was
impossible
—
quite
impossible
!
<EOS>
He
might
have
been
adangerous
enemy!—I
wish
<EOS>
my
halls
were
full!”One
of
those
disagreeable
feelings
<EOS>
came
over
Learmont
now
to
which
hehad
been
frightfully
subject
of
late
,
namely
,
a
fancy
that
some
one
wasconstantly
behind
him
,
turning
as
he
turned
,
and
ever
keeping
<EOS>
so
farbehind
him
as
never
to
permit
him
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
what
it
was
.
<EOS>
This
terror
always
for
a
time
reduced
him
to
a
pitiable
state
ofnervous
weakness
,
and
the
only
resource
he
could
ever
find
was
to
sitin
a
chair
,
the
back
of
which
was
close
to
a
wall
.
<EOS>
Trembling
,
therefore
,
and
slinking
along
like
one
accursed
,
he
sought
the
smallroom
he
usually
sat
in
,
and
there
remained
for
some
hours
in
theposition
we
have
described
,
awaiting
the
coming
of
his
guests
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
nine
o’clock
,
the
street
began
to
show
signs
of
animation;ancient
lumbering
coaches
drawn
by
sleek
,
fat
horses
,
bore
preciousfreights
of
rank
and
beauty
to
Learmont
’s
doors
,
which
were
thrown
wideopen
,
the
steps
being
lined
by
lacqueys
,
many
of
whom
bore
flaminglinks
.
<EOS>
Some
gentlemen
came
on
horseback
,
concealing
their
costumes
withample
cloaks
,
and
before
ten
o’clock
(
for
our
ancestors
began
theiramusements
earlier
and
left
off
sooner
than
we
do
)
<EOS>
the
thoroughfare
wasnearly
blocked
up
with
chairs
.
<EOS>
Then
ensued
a
scene
of
squabbling
among
coachmen
,
linkmen
,
chairman,&c
,
a
faint
imitation
of
which
sometimes
is
exhibited
at
a
modern
rout
.
<EOS>
Learmont
<EOS>
’s
saloons
presented
a
most
dazzling
appearance
:
the
richnessand
variety
of
the
costumes
—
the
immense
looking
-
glasses
—
the
brilliantlighting
—
the
glitter
of
diamonds
—
the
waving
of
countless
plumes
—
themusic
now
coming
in
wild
crashes
of
melody
,
and
then
sinking
to
aplaintive
measure
above
the
soft
tones
of
which
could
be
heard
the
humof
voices
—
the
merry
laughter
of
the
young
,
and
the
shuffle
of
thedancers
’
feet
,
as
now
and
then
a
space
would
be
cleared
for
a
giddycouple
,
who
ere
the
regular
ball
began
would
extemporise
a
dance
.
<EOS>
Learmont
too
was
marching
among
his
guests
for
some
time
,
like
a
spiritof
evil
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
cloud
upon
his
brow
,
but
he
wrestled
with
the
darkspirit
that
clung
to
his
heart
,
and
soon
his
countenance
becamewreathed
in
smiles
,
and
he
had
a
word
of
welcome
,
of
gaiety
,
or
offriendship
,
for
every
one
of
his
guests
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
he
would
pause
,
andcast
his
eye
about
him
,
to
note
if
all
had
arrived,—a
fact
<EOS>
he
couldonly
judge
of
by
the
thronged
state
of
the
rooms
,
for
being
a
maskedhall
there
was
no
announcement
of
names
.
<EOS>
Learmont
,
however
,
hadprovided
against
the
contingency
of
not
knowing
those
parties
to
whomhe
wished
to
speak
privately
,
by
leaving
orders
in
his
hall
that
astheir
tickets
were
taken
,
an
accurate
account
of
their
costumes
shouldbe
brought
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
already
been
told
that
the
minister
had
arrived
,
and
wasenveloped
in
a
purple
cloak
,
embroidered
with
silver
lace
,
and
that
SirFrancis
Hartleton
,
likewise
in
domino
,
had
come
with
a
small
party
inhis
company
,
he
having
a
black
velvet
cloak
,
and
a
hat
with
whitefeathers
.
<EOS>
The
Brereton
party
Learmont
was
well
aware
he
would
have
no
difficultyin
recognising
,
for
they
were
too
much
impressed
with
their
own
dignityto
hesitate
in
throwing
off
all
incognita
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
The
dancing
was
to
commence
at
eleven
o’clock
;
but
before
that
hourLearmont
saw
that
the
principal
saloon
was
uncomfortably
crowded
,
andhe
immediately
ordered
the
folding
doors
conducting
to
the
nextapartment
,
which
was
deliciously
cool
to
be
thrown
open
,
and
the
ballto
commence
.
<EOS>
Directing
his
eyes
to
the
musicians
,
and
clapping
hishands
,
they
struck
up
a
lively
measure
,
when
he
advanced
to
the
haughtyLady
Brereton
,
the
younger
,
and
offering
her
his
hand
,
begged
thehonour
of
opening
the
ball
with
her
,
at
the
same
time
slightly
removinghis
mask
to
assure
her
who
he
was
,
although
such
a
measure
wasneedless
,
for
there
was
not
one
of
his
guests
who
had
ever
seen
himbefore
,
that
failed
to
recognise
him
.
<EOS>
A
large
space
was
cleared
for
thedance
,
and
Learmont
led
the
proud
beauty
to
perform
one
of
thoseelaborate
and
tedious
minuets
now
so
properly
exploded
.
<EOS>
When
it
wasover
,
Learmont
led
the
lady
to
a
magnificent
seat
,
and
while
the
bandstruck
up
a
lively
measure
,
and
one
of
those
laughter
-
provoking
danceswhich
a
hundred
couple
might
engage
in
was
proceeding
,
making
the
verylights
dance
in
the
chandeliers
,
he
stooped
to
the
lady
<EOS>
’s
<EOS>
ear
,
andwhispered,—“May
I
presume
to
hope
that
my
devotion
to
your
beauty
will
ensure
mesuccess
in
my
suit
for
your
hand
?
<EOS>
My
income
is
immense
,
and
I
havenearly
half
a
million
of
ready
money
.
<EOS>
The
other
half
you
see
around
youin
the
decorations
of
this
house
.
<EOS>
”There
was
surely
some
fatality
about
Learmont
’s
money
,
for
at
thatmoment
a
trembling
servant
stepped
up
to
him
,
and
said,—“An
it
please
you
,
sir
,
there
’s
a
—
a
row
in
the
hall
;
and
,
and
—
an
pleaseyou
,
sir
,
it’s
—

.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
man
tendered
to
Learmont
a
dirty
scrap
of
paper
,
on
which
he
read,—“The
King
of
the
Old
Smithy

and

”CHAPTER
<EOS>
CXVI.The
Death
of
Learmont
.
<EOS>
It
was
well
<EOS>
Learmont
’s
face
was
partially
concealed
by
a
mask
,
or
eventhe
<EOS>
Honourable
Georgiana
Brereton
might
have
had
her
fine
aristocraticnerves
shocked
by
the
death
-
like
hue
of
his
features
,
as
he
gasped,—“Damnation!”A
slight
scream
burst
from
her
ladyship
’s
lips
,
and
then
a
generalclapping
of
hands
caused
Learmont
to
look
around
,
when
he
saw
Brittonattired
in
his
garments
as
a
smith
,
and
wearing
an
enormous
nose
,
executing
a
grotesque
dance
with
Bond
the
butcher
,
who
had
disdainedall
concealment
,
and
came
in
his
usual
,
not
very
elegant
,
costume
.
<EOS>
Up
the
centre
of
the
saloon
,
the
guests
making
way
for
them
,
they
camelike
two
bears
at
play
,
stamping
,
waving
,
whirling
round
,
treading
oneach
other
’s
toes
,
and
then
cuffing
each
other
with
boisterous
mirth
,
till
they
reached
the
place
where
Learmont
stood
,
when
,
rushing
forwardwith
a
shriek
of
rage
,
the
squire
clutched
Britton
by
the
throat
withdesperate
energy
,
and
said—“Villain
—
wretch
!
<EOS>
How
dare
you?”“Hands
off
,
squire
,
”
cried
Britton
.
<EOS>
“And
<EOS>
eyes
on
,
”
added
the
butcher
,
recollecting
that
these
were
thewords
of
an
announcement
he
used
to
append
to
the
fattest
meat
.
<EOS>
“Bravo
!
Bravo!—Capital
!
”
cried
many
of
the
guests
,
thinking
that
thewhole
affair
was
got
up
as
part
of
the
evening
’s
amusement
.
<EOS>
Even
theminister
smiled
,
and
wondered
to
a
mask
who
stood
next
him
,
if
the
twostrange
creatures
had
votes
.
<EOS>
“Andrew
Britton
,
”
growled
Learmont
,
in
the
smith
<EOS>
’s
<EOS>
ear
,
“
are
you
<EOS>
mad?”“You
be
d
—
d

”
<EOS>
was
the
elegant
rejoinder
.
<EOS>
“
Hurrah
!
<EOS>
Come
along
,
Bond
,
nowfor
it
.
”Upon
<EOS>
this
the
butcher
took
from
one
capacious
pocket
<EOS>
the
same
cleaverwhich
had
been
the
instrument
of
Jacob
Gray
’s
murder
,
and
from
anothera
large
bone
,
with
which
he
executed
such
a
lively
tune
upon
the
flatof
the
weapon
,
that
Britton
roared
again
with
mirth
and
after
a
wilddance
,
sat
down
,
on
the
floor
,
and
shouted
like
a
wild
animal
.
<EOS>
Then
hecaught
hold
of
the
Honourable
Georgiana
Brereton
’s
foot
,
and
her
whitesatin
slipper
coming
off
in
his
hands
,
he
fell
on
the
flat
of
his
back
,
while
shouts
,
screams
,
roars
of
laughter
,
and
the
clapping
of
hands
,
sounded
through
the
saloon
.
<EOS>
Learmont
made
a
rush
from
the
rooms
,
and
summoning
all
the
servants
hecould
meet
with
,
he
brought
them
back
with
him
,
in
order
that
theymight
eject
Britton
and
Bond
;
but
by
this
time
the
smith
had
arisenfrom
the
floor
,
and
turning
to
the
squire
,
he
said,—“Honour
bright
,
and
no
nonsense
.
<EOS>
D

<EOS>
n

Ladies

<EOS>
Strike

<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
butcher
again
played
the
marrow
-
bone
and
cleaver
,
and
with
manywhirls
,
shouts
,
and
singular
gyrations
,
he
and
Britton
left
the
saloon
.
<EOS>
Learmont
stood
for
some
moments
trembling
with
rage
:
then
,
suddenly
,
hecried,—“Music

”A
crash
of
melody
followed
his
call
,
and
he
was
looking
for
the
lady
hehad
left
when
a
domino
in
a
black
velvet
cloak
met
his
eye
.
<EOS>
The
domino
bowed
and
unmasked
.
<EOS>
“The
<EOS>
rooms
are
warm
,
squire
.
”“Ha
!
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
”
cried
Learmont
.
<EOS>
Then
a
sudden
thought
struck
him
,
that
he
would
efface
all
recollectionof
Britton
’s
drunken
vagary
,
by
calling
public
attention
to
the
forgedpaper
he
had
intended
to
give
Sir
Francis
privately
.
<EOS>
He
waved
his
armto
the
musicians
,
and
they
suddenly
paused
in
the
midst
of
a
livelyair
,
which
had
the
effect
of
preparing
the
guests
for
somethingunusual
.
<EOS>
As
many
as
could
,
crowded
round
Learmont
and
Sir
FrancisHartleton
,
while
the
former
said
,
in
a
loud
voice,—“I
have
had
placed
in
my
hands
a
packet
addressed
to
Sir
FrancisHartleton
,
which
I
am
informed
has
been
found
at
the
lodgings
of
theman
who
,
you
have
all
heard
,
was
murdered
on
Wednesday
morning
early
,
in
this
immediate
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
”Sir
<EOS>
Francis
Hartleton
looked
astonished
;
and
taking
off
his
mask
,
heglanced
round
him
anxiously
.
<EOS>
A
murmur
of
curiosity
rose
among
theguests
.
<EOS>
Many
mounted
upon
chairs
,
and
some
few
even
upon
the
tables
.
<EOS>
Amore
curious
scene
than
Learmont
’s
saloon
then
presented
could
scarcelybe
imagined
.
<EOS>
“Read
—
read
!
”
<EOS>
cried
many
voices
,
as
Sir
Francis
took
a
sealed
paper
,
which
was
handed
to
him
by
Learmont
,
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
Theshouts
to
him
to
read
the
document
increased
each
moment
,
and
then
asudden
thought
crossed
the
mind
of
Sir
Francis
,
that
the
squire
mightbe
caught
in
his
own
snare
.
<EOS>
In
the
same
pocket
in
which
he
had
placedthe
<EOS>
packet
Learmont
had
given
him
<EOS>
,
Sir
Francis
had
the
real
confessionof
Jacob
Gray
,
which
he
had
brought
with
him
to
show
the
minister
,
should
an
opportunity
present
itself
.
<EOS>
“Shall
<EOS>
I
read
that
,
and
confound
the
guilty
squire
at
once
,
”
thoughtSir
Francis
,
“
I
have
plenty
of
assistance
at
hand
for
his
capture
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
hesitated
a
moment
,
and
then
said
aloud,—“His
Majesty
’s
Secretary
of
State
is
present
,
if
he
will
sanction
myreading
the
paper
aloud
,
I
will
do
so
,
<EOS>
but
as
it
may
possibly
criminatesome
one
,
I
demand
that
the
door
be
secured
.
<EOS>
”“Aye
,
”
cried
Learmont
.
<EOS>
“
Secure
the
door
.
<EOS>
Let
no
one
pass
in
or
out
.
”He
<EOS>
then
cast
a
triumphant
glance
at
the
magistrate
,
for
he
felt
so
verysure
how
disappointed
he
would
be
.
<EOS>
The
minister
now
took
off
the
mask
,
and
said,—“Well
,
<EOS>
well
;
it
ca
n’t
be
helped
.
<EOS>
Go
on
,
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
”There
was
now
a
breathless
silence
,
and
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
drew
fromhis
pocket
the
real
confession
of
Jacob
Gray
.
<EOS>
Learmont
was
in
far
toogreat
a
state
of
excitement
to
notice
any
difference
in
the
aspect
ofthe
documents
,
and
waving
his
arm
,
he
cried,—“Silence
,
friends
,
and
welcome
guests
.
<EOS>
We
may
find
some
secrets
hereworthy
our
attention
.
<EOS>
”Sir
<EOS>
Francis
cast
his
eyes
upon
Learmont
with
a
look
of
peculiar
meaningas
<EOS>
he
said,—“You
will
,
I
think
,
in
this
instance
,
squire
,
turn
out
a
true
prophet
.
”He
<EOS>
then
opened
the
confession
,
and
while
every
sound
was
hushed
,
andall
eyes
bent
upon
his
,
he
,
in
a
clear
full
voice
,
read,—To
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
I
,
Jacob
Gray
,
address
the
following
confession
and
statement
of
factsto
you
because
,
from
circumstances
within
your
own
remembrance
,
youwill
the
more
readily
believe
what
is
here
recorded
.
<EOS>
May
the
bitterestcurse
of
a
dead
man
fall
upon
you
and
yours
,
if
you
do
not
take
instantmeans
to
bring
to
an
ignominious
end
those
who
I
shall
accuse
of
crimeswhich
shall
far
exceed
any
that
I
have
committed
.
<EOS>
By
the
time
youreceive
this
,
I
shall
most
probably
be
dead
,
or
have
left
England
forsome
distant
land
,
where
all
search
for
me
would
be
in
vain
.
<EOS>
I
leave
,
however
,
behind
,
whether
dead
or
absent
,
this
legacy
of
vengeance
andso
fulfil
a
promise
I
made
to
my
own
heart
to
destroy
those
who
wouldlong
since
have
murdered
me
,
but
that
I
had
fenced
myself
round
withsafeguards
which
they
dared
not
despise
.
<EOS>
In
the
year
1737
,
I
was
staying
at
Genoa
,
where
I
had
been
dischargedfrom
the
service
of
an
English
family
for
matters
that
are
of
noconsequence
to
my
present
narrative
.
<EOS>
For
some
months
I
could
procure
noemployment
,
until
an
English
gentleman
,
by
name
,
Mark
Learmont
—
<EOS>
The
guilty
squire
seemed
absolutely
stupified
until
the
magistrate
hadgot
thus
far
,
and
then
with
a
cry
that
struck
terror
to
the
hearts
ofall
who
heard
it
,
he
drew
his
sword
,
and
with
the
wildness
of
despair
,
dashed
through
the
throng
of
masks
around
him
,
shouting,—“Tis
false—’tis
false
—
false
as
hell
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
do
the

—
make
way
—
<EOS>

<EOS>
Help

<EOS>
A

”He
had
wounded
several
persons
before
,
in
the
universal
panic
,
theycould
get
out
of
his
way
,
and
then
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
raised
hisvoice
above
all
other
sounds
,
shouting—“Seize
the
murderer
.
”In
<EOS>
an
instant
<EOS>
some
half
dozen
of
the
maskers
threw
off
their
dominosand
masks
,
presenting
to
the
astonished
eyes
of
the
guests
,
roughlyattired
,
well
<EOS>
armed
men
,
who
immediately
darted
after
Learmont
.
<EOS>
Two
other
persons
,
likewise
threw
down
their
masks
.
<EOS>
One
was
AlbertSeyton
and
the
other
was
Ada
;
but
by
this
time
the
half
-
maddened
squirehad
fought
his
way
to
the
further
end
of
the
saloon
,
and
dashingagainst
some
folding
doors
,
they
flew
open
,
disclosing
a
flight
ofsteps
leading
to
a
conservatory
filled
with
rare
plants
;
waving
,
then
,
his
sword
round
his
head
,
he
sprang
up
the
steps
.
<EOS>
“Surrender
or
we
fire
,
”
cried
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
.
<EOS>
Learmont
turned
,
and
said
something
that
was
not
heard
in
theconfusion
—
blood
was
streaming
down
his
face
,
for
he
had
bit
his
lipsthrough
,
and
he
made
repeated
lunges
with
his
sword
,
as
now
withfrantic
voice
and
gesture
,
he
cried,—“Off
—
off
—
tear
me
not
to
hell
—
fiends
,
off
—
why
do
you
glare
atme
—
off

off—’tis
<EOS>
false

I

”
cried
the
magistrate
,
as
he
himself
sprung
upon
the
firststep
.
<EOS>
“Yield
,
monster
,
”
said
Albert
Seyton
,
as
passing
Sir
Francis
,
he
flewup
the
staircase
.
<EOS>
At
the
sight
of
him
,
Learmont
uttered
a
cry
of
despair
;
but
when
Ada
,
fearful
for
Albert
’s
safety
,
was
by
his
side
in
a
moment
,
and
Learmontmet
her
gaze
,
his
sword
dropped
from
his
grasp
,
and
he
could
but
totterbackwards
towards
the
conservatory
,
shrieking,—“The
dead
—
<EOS>
the
dead
—
Gray
next
—
and
then
—
my
brother
—
my
murdered
brother—”With
a
heavy
crash
he
fell
just
within
the
door
of
the
conservatory
,
and
was
immediately
seized
by
the
officers
of
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
,
who
himself
turning
on
the
steps
,
said,—“I
<EOS>
much
grieve
to
have
marred
the
mirth
of
this
noble
company
,
but
<EOS>
Iapprehend
Squire
Learmont
,
as
a
murderer
—
an
assassin
—
a
persecutor
ofthe
innocent
—
a
reveller
in
the
wealth
of
another

<EOS>
This
young
maiden

Ihere
proclaim
as
heiress
of

<EOS>
”Ada
<EOS>
shrunk
back
,
as
Sir
Francis
pointed
to
her
,
and
leaning
upon
thearm
of
Albert
,
she
sobbed
as
she
said,—“Oh

tell
me
,
Albert
,
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
fearful
scene
.
<EOS>
”“I

“
His

was

at

ceremony

<EOS>
”“Ada

cried
Albert
,
rapturously
.
<EOS>
“
Look
up

Ada
.
”“This

said
Sir

Hartleton
,
addressing
her
,
“

<EOS>
Itis
for
you
to
make

welcome
,
or

<EOS>
”Ada
<EOS>
burst
into
tears
,
and
was
led
down
the
steps
by
Albert
and
themagistrate
,
but
scarcely
had
they
entered
the
saloon
,
when
the
officerswho
captured
Learmont
,
appeared
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
with
him
.
<EOS>
Alleyes
were
fixed
upon
his
face
,
which
was
livid
and
ghastly
.
<EOS>
He
offeredno
opposition
,
but
came
down
step
-
by
step
with
an
awful
calmness
,
likeone
going
to
execution
,
who
had
long
since
bid
adieu

<EOS>
When
hereached
halfway
,
he
paused
,
and
extending
both
his

,
while
hisfingers
pointed
to
Sir

Hartleton
,
he
burst
into
such
a
frantichowling
laugh
,
that
the
officers
shrunk
from
him
aghast
.
<EOS>
Then
an
awfulspasm
came
across
his
face
,
and
like
a
log
,
he
fell
upon
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
When
raised
he
was
found
quite
dead
.
<EOS>
A
small
phial
,
which
wasafterwards
picked
up
in

A

ran
through
the
gaily
attired

at

awful
and
mostunlooked
for
termination
of
the
fête
they
had
come
to

<EOS>
Manypulled
off
their
masks
,
and
Ada
,
as
she
clung
convulsively
to
Albert
,
said,—“Oh

poor

<EOS>
”Sir
<EOS>
Francis
Hartleton
then
spoke
aloud
,
saying,—“This

”The
<EOS>
guests
huddled
together
in
groups
,
and
looked
in
each
other
’s
<EOS>
faceswith
fear
and
amazement
,
while
each
wondered
what
next
would
occur
tofill
them
with
terror

Sir

observing

pause

as

all
knew

felt
assured

aswas
indeed
the
fact

that
she
had
strayed
from

called
tothem

a
loud
voice,—“To

”“Who

cried
Maud
,
springing
to

and
holding
above

the
glittering

her
eyesbeamed
with
a

<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
then
sheathed
his
sword
,
and
turning
to
theSecretary
of
State
,
said
,
with
a
low
bow—“As

”“Who

cried
the

<EOS>
“

The

with
mad
Maud
,
forthere
was
nothing
to
be
got
by
running
the
chance
of
an
ugly
wound
withthe
knife
she
carried
,
and
the
consequence
was
that
she
outstrippedevery
one
in
the
race
to
the
Chequers
,
being
the
unconscious
cause
ofgiving
an
alarm
of
danger
to
Britton
which
he
otherwise
would
not
havereceived
.
<EOS>
He
was
still
sitting
with
Bond
,
exulting
over
the
success
ofhis
visit
to
Learmont
’s
,
and
regretting
that
,
before
he
left
,
he
hadnot
gone
to
greater
lengths
in
his
wild
spirit
of
mischief
,
when
ascuffle
at
the
door
of
the
Chequers
attracted
his
attention
,
and
thenhe
heard
the
voice
of
Maud
—
a
voice
he
knew
full
well
,
shrieking
in
itsloudest
accents,—“Andrew
Britton
!
<EOS>
Andrew
Britton
!
<EOS>
I
have
come
to
see
you
die
!
<EOS>
SavageBritton
,
come
forth
!
<EOS>
Murderer
,
I
have
come
to
see
you
die
.
<EOS>
”“Now
,
by
all
the
foul
fiends
,
”
cried
Britton
,
“
I
will
be
troubled
bythat
croaking
witch
no
more
.
<EOS>
”He
<EOS>
rose
from
his
seat
,
and
despite
the
remonstrances
of
Bond
,
rushedinto
the
passage
to
execute
summary
vengeance
upon
poor
Maud
,
when
hewas
seized
by
one
of
the
officers
,
who
had
been
quicker
than
hisfellows
,
and
who
cried,—“Andrew
Britton
,
you
are
my
prisoner
.
<EOS>
”For
<EOS>
one
instant
Britton
was
passive
,
and
then
drawing
a
long
breath
,
heseized
the
unlucky
officer
<EOS>
round
the
waist
,
and
with
one
tremendousthrow
he
pitched
him
through
the
open
doorway
into
the
street
,
where
hefell
with
a
deep
groan
,
for
a
moment
obstructing
the
passage
of
hiscomrades
,
and
giving
Britton
time
to
dart
up
the
staircase
,
which
hedid
as
quickly
as
his
unwieldy
bulk
would
let
him
.
<EOS>
In
another
momentthe
voice
of
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
—
the
only
one
he
dreaded
—
rung
in
hisears
as
the
magistrate
cried—“A
hundred
pounds
for
the
apprehension
of
Andrew
Britton
!
<EOS>
After
him
,
men
—
after
him
!
<EOS>
Follow
me!”Maud
stood
screaming
with
a
wild
unearthly
glee
in
the
passage
,
andclapping
her
hands
while
Sir
Francis
and
his
officers
rushed
up
thenarrow
staircase
of
the
Chequers
.
<EOS>
As
for
Bond
,
he
just
looked
out
atthe
parlour
door
;
when
he
saw
how
affairs
were
proceeding
,
he
wentback
,
and
drunk
up
all
Britton
’s
liquor
,
after
which
lifting
one
of
thelow
parlour
windows
,
he
stepped
out
,
and
walked
leisurely
down
thestreet
with
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
,
as
if
nothing
particular
hadhappened
,
except
that
when
he
reached
the
corner
he
knocked
the
ashesout
of
his
pipe
against
a
post
,
and
remarked,—“That
’s
<EOS>
a
smasher!”Britton
was
not
much
intoxicated
previous
to
the
arrival
of
hisenemies
,
and
the
shock
of
finding
himself
thus
openly
sought
for
by
hisworst
,
or
at
all
events
,
his
most
dangerous
foe
,
completely
soberedhim
.
<EOS>
“
What
has
happened
to
Learmont
?
”
was
the
question
he
asked
ofhimself
as
he
reached
his
attic
and
bolted
the
door
,
in
order
to
gain
amoment
’s
time
for
thought
.
<EOS>
It
was
but
a
moment
,
however
,
that
he
had
tospare
,
and
while
the
confusion
and
terror
of
his
mind
were
each
instantgrowing
stronger
,
he
opened
the
window
and
clambered
out
into
thegutter
,
along
which
he
crawled
a
few
paces
,
and
then
commenced
theascent
of
the
sloping
roof
of
the
old
house
,
knowing
that
upon
itsother
slope
it
abutted
so
closely
upon
some
other
houses
,
that
in
thedarkness
of
the
night
he
would
have
a
chance
to
escape
.
<EOS>
For
the
firsttime
,
however
,
in
his
life
,
a
mortal
fear
crept
over
Britton
’s
heart
,
and
when
a
shout
arose
in
the
street
from
the
maskers
,
some
of
whom
sawhis
dark
figure
crawling
up
the
roof
,
he
was
compelled
to
clutchdesperately
to
it
,
to
save
himself
from
rolling
down
headlong
.
<EOS>
One
glance
behind
him
showed
him
the
officers
on
the
gutter
andpreparing
to
ascend
the
roof
.
<EOS>
“Come
down
,
or
we
fire
!
”
<EOS>
cried
one
.
<EOS>
“No
—
<EOS>
no
,
”
shouted
Sir
Francis
,
“
take
him
alive
;
he
can
not
escape
.
<EOS>
”“Cannot
escape
?
”
<EOS>
groaned
Britton
as
he
made
frantic
efforts
to
reachthe
top
of
the
roof
,
but
each
time
foiled
by
his
own
too
powerfulstruggles
,
for
the
small
flat
tiles
kept
coming
off
in
his
hands
,
whichwere
already
torn
and
bleeding
from
his
recent
exertions
.
<EOS>
Some
flambeaux
were
now
elevated
on
long
poles
,
borrowed
from
aneighbouring
shop
by
the
maskers
,
and
a
broad
red
glare
was
cast
uponthe
roof
of
the
Chequers
,
bewildering
the
eyes
of
the
smith
as
well
asmaking
him
visible
to
all
his
enemies
.
<EOS>
Then
shouts
,
hoots
,
screams
,
andall
sorts
of
discordant
cries
burst
from
the
rapidly
increasing
crowdbelow
,
while
several
of
the
officers
began
to
crawl
up
the
roof
afterBritton
,
who
by
the
most
tremendous
efforts
had
nearly
succeeded
ingaining
the
summit
.
<EOS>
“Come
down
,
men
,
”
cried
Sir
Francis
to
his
officers—”he
is
in
ourpower
—
down
,
all
of
you
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
magistrate
had
sent
one
of
the
officers
along
the
gutter
withinstructions
to
ascend
the
roof
as
rapidly
as
possible
some
distanceon
,
and
getting
upon
the
other
slope
meet
Britton
,
when
he
should
reachthe
top
;
and
seize
him
.
<EOS>
This
manœuvre
was
executed
with
adroitness
anddespatch
,
for
what
to
the
terrified
and
half
-
maddened
Britton
was
atask
of
immense
difficulty
,
was
nothing
to
the
cool
and
determinedofficer
,
whose
head
exactly
rose
up
and
faced
Britton
<EOS>
’s
as
he
reachedthe
summit
of
the
roof
.
<EOS>
With
a
cry
of
rage
Britton
clutched
the
man
by
the
collar
,
at
the
samemoment
that
the
officer
made
a
desperate
attempt
to
push
him
down
thesloping
roof
into
the
gutter
.
<EOS>
Then
all
the
devil
in
the
smith
’s
natureseemed
to
revive
—
fury
kindled
his
eyes
,
and
with
a
yell
more
like
thatof
a
wild
beast
than
a
human
being
,
he
dragged
the
officer
over
thepinnacle
of
the
roof
,
as
if
he
had
been
a
child
,
and
dashing
down
withthem
tiles
,
mortar
,
and
rubbish
,
the
two
rolled
with
tremendous
speedinto
the
gutter
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
shout
from
the
crowd
below
,
for
Britton
’s
capture
appearedcertain
,
when
a
large
piece
of
the
flat
stone
which
formed
the
streetside
of
the
gutter
gave
way
with
the
shock
of
the
two
rolling
bodies
,
and
fell
into
the
street
with
an
awful
crash
.
<EOS>
A
shriek
then
arose
froma
hundred
throats
—
one
half
of
either
Britton
’s
body
or
the
officer’s
,
no
one
could
tell
which
,
hung
over
the
abyss
.
<EOS>
There
was
one
plunge
ofthe
feet
,
and
many
of
the
crowd
turned
away
their
eyes
,
as
before
theofficers
above
,
or
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
could
get
a
hold
of
them
,
bothBritton
and
his
captor
fell
over
,
and
locked
in
an
embrace
of
death
,
reached
the
pavement
,
with
a
dull
,
hideous
sound
.
<EOS>
There
was
then
a
rushforward
of
the
crowd
,
but
it
was
found
in
vain
to
attempt
to
unlock
thedeath
clutch
of
the
two
men
—
both
were
dead
.
<EOS>
Britton
’s
<EOS>
face
was
terriblydisfigured
,
and
when
,
with
a
wild
terrible
cry
,
Maud
sprung
to
thecorpses
,
it
was
only
by
seeing
that
the
one
whose
face
was
discernible
,
was
not
Britton
,
that
she
could
guess
the
other
to
be
the
savage
smith
,
who
had
worked
her
so
much
woe
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
exult
—
she
did
not
scream
orlaugh
with
her
usual
mad
mirth
,
but
a
great
change
came
over
her
face
,
and
in
a
low
plaintive
tone
she
said,—“Where
<EOS>
am
I
<EOS>
—
is
this
<EOS>
my
wedding
-
day
—
what
has
happened
?
”
<EOS>
She
then
claspedher
head
with
her
hands
,
and
appeared
to
be
trying
to
think
—
reason
hadreturned
,
but
it
was
to
herald
death
.
<EOS>
“He
who
loved
me
is
no
more
,
”
she
moaned—“the
savage
smith
took
hislife
—
God
bless—”Her
head
sunk
upon
her
breast
—
lower
—
lower
still
she
drooped
.
<EOS>
Then
,
sometried
to
raise
her
—
they
spoke
kindly
to
her
,
but
her
spirit
had
fled
.

CHAPTER
CXVIII.Conclusion
.
<EOS>
Our
eventful
history
is
nearly
ended
,
and
yet
we
would
fain
linger
byAda
and
her
fortunes
.
<EOS>
We
would
fain
follow
still
through
the
variousscenes
of
life
,
the
child
which
was
brought
from
the
blazing
smithy
—
theenthusiastic
girl
,
who
,
in
the
majesty
and
might
of
innocence
,
defiedJacob
Gray,—the
pure
beautiful
being
,
who
in
maturer
years
denouncedhim
as
a
murderer
—
she
who
still
clung
to
her
first
,
her
only
love
,
andwhen
the
dearest
friend
that
fate
had
given
her
<EOS>
,
Sir
Francis
Hartletoneven
doubted
,
still
asserted
her
confidence
in
his
devotion
,
hisintegrity
,
and
his
love
.
<EOS>
We
would
like
to
follow
her
into
domesticlife
,
to
see
how
the
budding
graces
of
the
girl
reached
the
gloriousmeridian
of
their
charms
,
and
how
then
they
mellowed
into
a
gracefulautumn
,
but
already
we
have
been
seduced
beyond
our
limits
,
by
ourbeautiful
Ada
and
her
strangely
varied
fortunes
,
and
we
must
leave
tothose
readers
who
have
gone
with
us
heart
and
hand
thus
far
,
to
imaginefor
themselves
much
that
we
would
fain
record
.
<EOS>
Something
,
however
wecannot
refrain
from
stating
,
and
first
and
foremost
we
may
say
,
thatAda
became
Mrs.
Seyton
just
one
week
after
the
eventful
ball
atLearmont
’s
house
,
and
that
the
Secretary
of
State
came
to
the
marriage
,
and
wanted
to
give
the
bride
away
;
but
Sir
Francis
Hartleton
claimedthe
privilege
,
and
reconciled
the
minister
to
his
disappointment
byassuring
him
that
Ada
meant
to
let
him
have
all
the
parliamentaryinterest
connected
with
her
property
.
<EOS>
The
ladies
at
the
period
of
Ada
’s
marriage
wore
immense
state
dresses
,
which
“
would
stand
up
of
themselves
,
”
and
Ada
’s
,
still
well
preserved
,
is
considered
a
kind
of
heir
-
loom
in
the
author
’s
family
,
who
,
by
-
the
-
by
,
may
as
well
state
at
first
as
at
last
,
that
he
is
a
linealdescendant
of
the
persecuted
girl
,
and
more
proud
of
his
ancestressthan
if
she
had
been
a
throned
queen
.
<EOS>
For
the
satisfaction
of
his
lady
-
readers
,
the
author
begs
to
state
thatAda
’s
wedding
-
dress
was
,
and
is
of
silver
grey
satin
,
on
which
arewrought
roses
in
white
silk
,
with
here
and
there
so
delicate
a
roseatetinge
,
as
to
give
quite
an
air
of
reality
to
the
mimic
floraladornment
.
<EOS>
She
wore
no
ornaments
in
her
hair
,
but
a
rare
and
costlylace
robe
,
presented
to
her
by
Lady
Hartleton
,
was
confined
to
herforehead
by
a
single
diamond
,
from
whence
it
hung
down
to
the
veryground
.
<EOS>
Then
Albert
Seyton
looked
extremely
well
in
the
uniform
of
a
captain
inthe
guards
,
to
which
rank
he
had
been
immediately
presented
by
theminister
;
of
course
not
on
account
of
his
votes
—
<EOS>
oh
,
no
.
<EOS>
Lady
Hartleton
,
we
find
by
an
old
letter
before
us
,
was
foolish
enough
to
cry
at
themarriage
,
but
Ada
was
quite
obdurate
,
and
would
not
shed
a
tear
,
sayingin
<EOS>
her
quiet
way,—“Why
should
I
weep
when
I
’m
happy
,
”
and
as
nobody
knew
why
,
she
leftthe
church
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
We
dislike
interfering
in
family
affairs
,
but
we
must
say
,
that
wewould
have
proposed
Ada
’s
first
little
one
to
be
called
Albert
,
as
itwas
a
boy
,
but
she
would
have
it
named
Francis
,
after
the
worthymagistrate
,
who
stood
godfather
to
it
.
<EOS>
The
next
was
a
girl
,
and
thatAlbert
would
have
named
Ada
,
and
after
that
came
—
but
our
readers
mayimagine
all
that
,
when
we
tell
them
that
that
Ada
was
the
happy
motherof
as
happy
a
family
as
ever
lived
.

Sir
Francis
Hartleton
went
himself
down
to
the
Old
Smithy
,
and
upondigging
carefully
among
the
ruins
,
a
skeleton
form
was
found
,
whichfrom
the
remnants
of
clothing
still
adhering
to
it
,
was
proved
to
beAda
’s
unhappy
father
.
<EOS>
In
the
nearest
churchyard
,
the
remains
were
,
withall
proper
solemnity
,
consigned
to
the
tomb
,
but
Ada
was
not
informedof
the
circumstance
for
some
years
after
she
had
been
in
full
enjoymentof
the
Learmont
estates
.
<EOS>
It
would
appear
that
Britton
had
never
run
the
risk
of
having
a
writtenconfession
in
London
with
him
,
but
upon
a
careful
search
in
the
smithy
,
a
bag
was
found
,
in
which
was
a
knife
with
the
initials
of
“
J.G.
”
onthe
handle
,
and
several
letters
,
likewise
odd
papers
,
one
of
which
wasa
certificate
of
the
marriage
of
Ada
’s
mother
at
Rome
;
another
provedclearly
that
Learmont
,
who
had
lived
so
badly
,
and
died
so
terribly
,
was
really
illegitimate
,
so
that
his
claim
to
the
estate
was
not
goodunder
any
circumstances
.
<EOS>
Those
documents
and
papers
Sir
Francis
handed
to
Albert
Seyton
,
and
byhim
they
were
,
as
time
and
occasion
served
,
shown
to
Ada
.
<EOS>
Dame
Totten
was
diligently
sought
for
by
Ada
,
and
finally
found
in
awood
shed
.
<EOS>
She
said
that
soon
after
the
fire
at
the
smithy
,
Learmontand
Britton
called
at
her
cottage
,
and
with
bitter
threats
,
insistedupon
her
bringing
the
child
to
Learmont
House
in
the
morning
,
and
thatshe
fearing
for
its
life
,
fled
from
her
cottage
with
it
,
and
reachedLondon
,
where
she
subsisted
for
some
time
on
charity
,
till
a
man
robbedher
of
the
child
,
leaving
her
insensible
from
the
effects
of
the
blowhe
gave
her
.
<EOS>
The
aged
woman
,
for
she
was
nearly
ninety
,
shed
tears
ofjoy
upon
Ada
making
herself
known
to
her
,
and
need
we
say
,
that
theremainder
of
her
life
was
assisted
with
every
comfort
by
Ada
.
<EOS>
Bond
,
the
butcher
was
hanged
at
Tyburn
for
a
highway
robbery
,
attendedwith
brutal
violence
,
within
one
year
after
the
death
of
Britton
.
<EOS>
Asfor
the
landlord
of
the
Chequers
,
he
lost
his
licence
,
and
the
lastthat
was
heard
of
him
<EOS>
was
his
selling
a
liquor
called
snap
,
then
invogue
,
at
Bond
’s
execution

despite
all
her
grievous
trials

all
her
dangers

was

happy
,
and
,
in
course
of
time
,
she
thought
with
chastenedsorrow
upon
the
fate
of
her
father
,
and
learned
to
regard
with
patientresignation
as
one

“
Lloyd’sWeekly
Miscellany
”
having
attained
a
circulation
quite
unparalleled
inperiodical
literature
,
might
have
well
assured
the
author
of
the
abovetales
,
that
his
best
friends
,
the
public
,
were
willing
to
afford
himthe
highest
,
the
noblest
,
and
the
best
stimulus
to
futureexertion
—
namely
,
their
applause
;
but
he
is
in
a
situation
,
howeverinadequately
,
to
return
his
personal
thanks
to
some
two
hundred
andmore
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
have
favoured
him
with
privatecommunications
expressive
of
their
approbation
.
<EOS>
If
anything
would
move
the
heart
and
head
to
future
exertion
,
it
wouldbe
such
generous
appreciation
of
what
has
been
already
attempted
to
bedone
,
and
the
author
can
only
say
that
in
the
tales
which
he
msy
havethe
honour
of
laying
before
his
kind
patrons
,
as
well
as
those
alreadyin
progress
,
his
constant

shall
be
