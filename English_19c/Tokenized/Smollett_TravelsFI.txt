<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
You
laid
your
commands
upon
me
at
parting
,
to
communicate
from
time
to
time
the
observations
I
should
make
in
the
course
of
my
travels
and
it
was
an
injunction
I
received
with
pleasure
.
<EOS>
In
gratifying
your
curiosity
,
I
shall
find
some
amusement
to
beguile
the
tedious
hours
,
which
,
without
some
such
employment
,
would
be
rendered
insupportable
by
distemper
and
disquiet
.
  
<EOS>
You
knew
,
and
pitied
my
situation
,
traduced
by
malice
,
persecuted
by
faction
,
abandoned
by
false
patrons
,
and
overwhelmed
by
the
sense
of
a
domestic
calamity
,
which
it
was
not
in
the
power
of
fortune
to
repair
.
  
<EOS>
You
know
with
what
eagerness
I
fled
from
my
country
as
a
scene
of
illiberal
dispute
,
and
incredible
infatuation
,
where
a
few
worthless
incendiaries
had
,
by
dint
of
perfidious
calumnies
and
atrocious
abuse
,
kindled
up
a
flame
which
threatened
all
the
horrors
of
civil
dissension
.
  
<EOS>
I
packed
up
my
little
family
in
a
hired
coach
,
and
attended
by
my
trusty
servant
,
who
had
lived
with
me
a
dozen
of
years
,
and
now
refused
to
leave
me
,
took
the
road
to
Dover
,
in
my
way
to
the
South
of
France
,
where
I
hoped
the
mildness
of
the
climate
would
prove
favourable
to
the
weak
state
of
my
lungs
.
  
<EOS>
You
advised
me
to
have
recourse
again
to
the
Bath
waters
,
from
the
use
of
which
I
had
received
great
benefit
the
preceding
winter
:
<EOS>
but
I
had
many
inducements
to
leave
England
.
<EOS>
My
wife
earnestly
begged
I
would
convey
her
from
a
country
where
every
object
served
to
nourish
her
grief
:
I
was
in
hopes
that
a
succession
of
new
scenes
would
engage
her
attention
,
and
gradually
call
off
her
mind
from
a
series
of
painful
reflections
;
and
I
imagined
the
change
of
air
,
and
a
journey
of
near
a
thousand
miles
,
would
have
a
happy
effect
upon
my
own
constitution
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
the
summer
was
already
advanced
,
and
the
heat
too
excessive
for
travelling
in
warm
climates
<EOS>
,
I
proposed
staying
at
Boulogne
till
the
beginning
of
autumn
,
and
in
the
mean
time
to
bathe
in
the
sea
,
with
a
view
to
strengthen
and
prepare
my
body
for
the
fatigues
of
such
a
long
journey
.
  
<EOS>
A
man
who
travels
with
a
family
of
five
persons
,
must
lay
his
account
with
a
number
of
mortifications
;
and
some
of
these
I
have
already
happily
overcome
.
<EOS>
Though
I
was
well
acquainted
with
the
road
to
Dover
,
and
made
allowances
accordingly
,
I
could
not
help
being
chagrined
at
the
bad
accommodation
and
impudent
imposition
to
which
I
was
exposed
.
<EOS>
These
I
found
the
more
disagreeable
,
as
we
were
detained
a
day
extraordinary
on
the
road
,
in
consequence
of
my
wife
's
being
indisposed
.
  
<EOS>
I
need
not
tell
you
this
is
the
worst
road
in
England
with
respect
to
the
conveniences
of
travelling
,
and
must
certainly
impress
foreigners
with
an
unfavourable
opinion
of
the
nation
in
general
.
<EOS>
The
chambers
are
in
general
cold
and
comfortless
,
the
beds
paultry
,
the
cookery
execrable
,
the
wine
poison
,
the
attendance
bad
,
the
publicans
insolent
,
and
the
bills
extortion
;
there
is
not
a
drop
of
tolerable
malt
liquor
to
be
had
from
London
to
Dover
.
  
<EOS>
Every
landlord
and
every
waiter
harangued
upon
the
knavery
of
a
publican
in
Canterbury
,
who
had
charged
the
French
ambassador
forty
pounds
for
a
supper
that
was
not
worth
forty
shillings
.
<EOS>
They
talked
much
of
honesty
and
conscience
;
but
when
they
produced
their
own
bills
,
they
appeared
to
be
all
of
the
same
family
and
complexion
.
<EOS>
If
it
was
a
reproach
upon
the
English
nation
,
that
an
innkeeper
should
pillage
strangers
at
that
rate
;
it
is
a
greater
scandal
,
that
the
same
fellow
should
be
able
to
keep
his
house
still
open
.
<EOS>
I
own
,
I
think
it
would
be
for
the
honour
of
the
kingdom
to
reform
the
abuses
of
this
road
;
and
in
particular
to
improve
the
avenue
to
London
by
the
way
of
Kent
-
Street
,
which
is
a
most
disgraceful
entrance
to
such
an
opulent
city
.
<EOS>
A
foreigner
,
in
passing
through
this
beggarly
and
ruinous
suburb
,
conceives
such
an
idea
of
misery
and
meanness
,
as
all
the
wealth
and
magnificence
of
London
and
Westminster
are
afterwards
unable
to
destroy
.
<EOS>
A
friend
of
mine
,
who
brought
a
Parisian
from
Dover
in
his
own
post
-
chaise
,
contrived
to
enter
Southwark
after
it
was
dark
,
that
his
friend
might
not
perceive
the
nakedness
of
this
quarter
.
<EOS>
The
stranger
was
much
pleased
with
the
great
number
of
shops
full
of
merchandize
,
lighted
up
to
the
best
advantage
.
<EOS>
He
was
astonished
at
the
display
of
riches
in
Lombard
-
Street
and
Cheapside
.
<EOS>
The
badness
of
the
pavement
made
him
find
the
streets
twice
as
long
as
they
were
.
<EOS>
They
alighted
in
Upper
Brook
-
Street
by
Grosvenor
-
Square
;
and
when
his
conductor
told
him
they
were
then
about
the
middle
of
London
,
the
Frenchman
declared
,
with
marks
of
infinite
surprize
,
that
London
was
very
near
as
long
as
Paris
.
  
<EOS>
On
my
arrival
at
Dover
I
payed
off
my
coachman
,
who
went
away
with
a
heavy
heart
.
<EOS>
He
wanted
much
to
cross
the
sea
,
and
endeavoured
to
persuade
me
to
carry
the
coach
and
horses
to
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
been
resolved
to
set
out
immediately
for
the
South
,
perhaps
I
should
have
taken
his
advice
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
retained
him
at
the
rate
of
twenty
guineas
per
month
,
which
was
the
price
he
demanded
,
and
begun
my
journey
without
hesitation
,
I
should
travel
more
agreeably
than
I
can
expect
to
do
in
the
carriages
of
this
 
country
;
and
the
difference
of
the
expence
would
be
a
mere
trifle
.
<EOS>
I
would
advise
every
man
who
travels
through
France
to
bring
his
own
vehicle
along
with
him
,
or
at
least
to
purchase
one
at
Calais
or
Boulogne
,
where
second
-
hand
berlins
and
chaises
may
be
generally
had
at
reasonable
rates
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
offered
a
very
good
berlin
for
thirty
guineas
:
<EOS>
but
before
I
make
the
purchase
,
I
must
be
better
informed
touching
the
different
methods
of
travelling
in
this
country
.
  
<EOS>
Dover
is
commonly
termed
a
den
of
thieves
;
and
I
am
afraid
it
is
not
altogether
without
reason
,
it
has
acquired
this
appellation
.
<EOS>
The
people
are
said
to
live
by
piracy
in
time
of
war
;
and
by
smuggling
and
fleecing
strangers
in
time
of
peace
:
but
I
will
do
them
the
justice
to
say
,
they
make
no
distinction
between
foreigners
and
natives
.
<EOS>
Without
all
doubt
a
man
can
not
be
much
worse
lodged
and
worse
treated
in
any
part
of
Europe
;
nor
will
he
in
any
other
place
meet
with
more
flagrant
instances
of
fraud
,
imposition
,
and
brutality
.
<EOS>
One
would
imagine
they
had
formed
a
general
conspiracy
against
all
those
who
either
go
to
,
or
return
from
the
continent
.
<EOS>
About
five
years
ago
,
in
my
passage
from
Flushing
to
Dover
,
the
master
of
the
packet
-
boat
brought
-
to
all
of
a
sudden
off
the
South
Foreland
,
although
the
wind
was
as
favourable
as
it
could
blow
.
<EOS>
He
was
immediately
boarded
by
a
customhouse
boat
,
the
officer
of
which
appeared
to
be
his
friend
.
<EOS>
He
then
gave
the
passengers
to
understand
,
that
as
it
was
low
water
,
the
ship
could
not
go
into
the
harbour
;
but
that
the
boat
would
carry
them
ashore
with
their
baggage
.
  
<EOS>
The
custom
-
house
officer
demanded
a
guinea
for
this
service
,
and
the
bargain
was
made
.
<EOS>
Before
we
quitted
the
ship
,
we
were
obliged
to
gratify
the
cabin
-
boy
for
his
attendance
,
and
to
give
drink
-
money
to
the
sailors
.
<EOS>
The
boat
was
run
aground
on
the
open
beach
;
but
we
could
not
get
ashore
without
the
assistance
of
three
or
four
fellows
,
who
insisted
upon
being
paid
for
their
trouble
.
<EOS>
Every
parcel
and
bundle
,
as
it
was
landed
,
was
snatched
up
by
a
separate
porter
:
<EOS>
one
ran
away
with
a
hat
-
box
,
another
with
a
wig
-
box
,
a
third
with
a
couple
of
shirts
tied
up
in
a
handkerchief
,
and
two
were
employed
in
carrying
a
small
portmanteau
that
did
not
weigh
forty
pounds
.
<EOS>
All
our
things
were
hurried
to
the
custom
-
house
to
be
searched
,
and
the
searcher
was
paid
for
disordering
our
cloaths
:
from
thence
they
were
removed
to
the
inn
,
where
the
porters
demanded
half
-
a
-
crown
each
for
their
labour
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
to
expostulate
;
they
surrounded
the
house
like
a
pack
of
hungry
bounds
,
and
raised
such
a
clamour
,
that
we
were
fain
to
comply
.
<EOS>
After
we
had
undergone
all
this
imposition
,
we
were
visited
by
the
master
of
the
packet
,
who
,
having
taken
our
fares
,
and
wished
us
joy
of
our
happy
arrival
in
England
,
expressed
his
hope
that
we
would
remember
the
poor
master
,
whose
wages
were
very
small
,
and
who
chiefly
depended
upon
the
generosity
of
the
passengers
.
<EOS>
I
own
I
was
shocked
at
his
meanness
,
and
could
not
help
telling
him
so
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
,
I
could
not
conceive
what
title
he
had
to
any
such
gratification
<EOS>
:
he
had
sixteen
passengers
,
who
paid
a
guinea
each
,
on
the
supposition
that
every
person
should
have
a
bed
;
but
there
were
no
more
than
eight
beds
in
the
cabin
,
and
each
of
these
was
occupied
before
I
came
on
board
;
so
that
if
we
had
been
detained
at
sea
a
whole
week
by
contrary
winds
and
bad
weather
,
one
half
of
the
passengers
must
have
slept
upon
the
boards
,
howsoever
their
health
might
have
suffered
from
this
want
of
accommodation
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
this
check
,
he
was
so
very
abject
and
importunate
,
that
we
gave
him
a
crown
a
-
piece
,
and
he
retired
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
thing
I
did
when
I
arrived
at
Dover
this
last
time
,
was
to
send
for
the
master
of
a
packet
-
boat
,
and
agree
with
him
to
carry
us
to
Boulogne
at
once
,
by
which
means
I
saved
the
expence
of
travelling
by
land
from
Calais
to
this
last
place
,
a
journey
of
four
-
and
-
twenty
miles
.
<EOS>
The
hire
of
a
vessel
from
Dover
to
Boulogne
is
precisely
the
same
as
from
Dover
to
Calais
,
five
guineas
;
but
this
skipper
demanded
eight
,
and
,
as
I
did
not
know
the
fare
,
I
agreed
to
give
him
six
.
<EOS>
We
embarked
between
six
and
seven
in
the
evening
,
and
found
ourselves
in
a
most
wretched
hovel
,
on
board
what
is
called
a
Folkstone
cutter
.
<EOS>
The
cabin
was
so
small
that
a
dog
could
hardly
turn
in
it
,
and
the
beds
put
me
in
mind
of
the
holes
described
in
some
catacombs
,
in
which
the
bodies
of
the
dead
were
deposited
,
being
thrust
in
with
the
feet
foremost
;
there
was
no
getting
into
them
but
end
-
ways
,
and
indeed
they
seemed
so
dirty
,
that
nothing
but
extreme
necessity
could
have
obliged
me
to
use
them
.
<EOS>
We
sat
up
all
night
in
a
most
uncomfortable
situation
,
tossed
about
by
the
sea
,
cold
,
arid
cramped
and
weary
,
and
languishing
for
want
of
sleep
.
<EOS>
At
three
in
the
morning
the
master
came
down
,
and
told
us
we
were
just
off
the
harbour
of
Boulogne
;
but
the
wind
blowing
off
shore
,
he
could
not
possibly
enter
,
and
therefore
advised
us
to
go
ashore
in
the
boat
.
<EOS>
I
went
upon
deck
to
view
the
coast
,
when
he
pointed
to
the
place
where
he
said
Boulogne
stood
,
declaring
at
the
same
time
we
were
within
a
short
mile
of
the
harbour
's
mouth
.
<EOS>
The
morning
was
cold
and
raw
,
and
I
knew
myself
extremely
subject
to
catch
cold
;
nevertheless
we
were
all
so
impatient
to
be
ashore
,
that
I
resolved
to
take
his
advice
.
<EOS>
The
boat
was
already
hoisted
out
,
and
we
went
on
board
of
it
,
after
I
had
paid
the
captain
and
gratified
his
crew
.
<EOS>
We
had
scarce
parted
from
the
ship
,
when
we
perceived
a
boat
coming
towards
us
from
the
shore
;
and
the
master
gave
us
to
understand
,
it
was
coming
to
carry
us
into
the
harbour
.
<EOS>
When
I
objected
to
the
trouble
of
shifting
from
one
boat
to
another
in
the
open
sea
,
which
(
by
the
bye
)
was
a
little
rough
;
he
said
it
was
a
privilege
which
the
watermen
of
Boulogne
had
,
to
carry
all
passengers
ashore
,
and
that
this
privilege
he
durst
not
venture
to
infringe
.
<EOS>
This
was
no
time
nor
place
to
remonstrate
.
<EOS>
The
French
boat
came
alongside
half
filled
with
water
,
and
we
were
handed
from
the
one
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
We
were
then
obliged
to
lie
upon
our
oars
,
till
the
captain
's
boat
went
on
board
and
returned
from
the
ship
with
a
packet
of
letters
.
<EOS>
We
were
afterwards
rowed
a
long
league
,
in
a
rough
sea
,
against
wind
and
tide
,
before
we
reached
the
harbour
,
where
we
landed
,
benumbed
with
cold
,
and
the
women
excessively
sick
:
from
our
landing
-
place
we
were
obliged
to
walk
very
near
a
mile
to
the
inn
where
we
purposed
to
lodge
,
attended
by
six
or
seven
men
and
women
,
bare
-
legged
,
carrying
our
baggage
.
<EOS>
This
boat
cost
me
a
guinea
,
besides
paying
exorbitantly
the
people
who
carried
our
things
;
so
that
the
inhabitants
of
Dover
and
of
Boulogne
seem
to
be
of
the
same
kidney
,
and
indeed
they
understand
one
another
perfectly
well
.
<EOS>
It
was
our
honest
captain
who
made
the
signal
for
the
shore
-
boat
before
I
went
upon
deck
;
by
which
means
he
not
only
gratified
his
friends
,
the
watermen
of
Boulogne
,
but
also
saved
about
fifteen
shillings
portage
,
which
he
must
have
paid
<EOS>
had
he
gone
into
the
harbour
;
and
thus
he
found
himself
at
liberty
to
return
to
Dover
,
which
he
reached
in
four
hours
.
<EOS>
I
mention
these
circumstances
as
a
warning
to
other
passengers
.
<EOS>
When
a
man
hires
a
packet
-
boat
from
Dover
to
Calais
or
Boulogne
,
let
him
remember
that
the
stated
price
is
five
guineas
;
and
let
him
insist
upon
being
carried
into
the
harbour
in
the
ship
,
without
paying
the
least
regard
to
the
representations
of
the
master
,
who
is
generally
a
little
dirty
knave
.
<EOS>
When
he
tells
you
it
is
low
water
,
or
the
wind
is
in
your
teeth
,
you
may
say
you
will
stay
on
board
till
it
is
high
water
,
or
till
the
wind
comes
favourable
.
<EOS>
If
he
sees
you
are
resolute
,
he
will
find
means
to
bring
his
ship
into
the
harbour
,
or
at
least
to
convince
you
,
without
a
possibility
of
your
being
deceived
,
that
it
is
not
in
his
power
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
the
fellow
himself
was
a
loser
by
his
finesse
;
if
he
had
gone
into
the
harbour
,
he
would
have
had
another
fare
immediately
back
to
Dover
,
for
there
was
a
Scotch
gentleman
at
the
inn
waiting
for
such
an
opportunity
.
  
<EOS>
Knowing
my
own
weak
constitution
,
I
took
it
for
granted
this
morning
's
adventure
<EOS>
would
cost
me
a
fit
of
illness
;
and
what
added
to
my
chagrin
,
when
we
arrived
at
the
inn
,
all
the
beds
were
occupied
;
so
that
we
were
obliged
to
sit
in
a
cold
kitchen
above
two
hours
,
until
some
of
the
lodgers
should
get
up
.
<EOS>
This
was
such
a
bad
specimen
of
French
accommodation
,
that
my
wife
could
not
help
regretting
even
the
inns
of
Rochester
,
Sittingbourn
,
and
Canterbury
:
bad
as
they
are
,
they
certainly
have
the
advantage
,
when
compared
with
the
execrable
auberges
of
this
country
,
where
one
finds
nothing
but
dirt
and
imposition
.
<EOS>
One
would
imagine
the
French
were
still
at
war
with
the
English
,
for
they
pillage
them
without
mercy
.
  
<EOS>
Among
the
strangers
at
this
inn
where
we
lodged
,
there
was
a
gentleman
of
the
faculty
,
just
returned
from
Italy
.
<EOS>
Understanding
that
I
intended
to
winter
in
the
South
of
France
,
on
account
of
a
pulmonic
disorder
,
he
strongly
recommended
the
climate
of
Nice
in
Provence
,
which
,
indeed
,
I
had
often
heard
extolled
;
and
I
am
almost
resolved
to
go
thither
,
not
only
for
the
sake
of
the
air
,
but
also
for
its
situation
on
the
Mediterranean
,
where
I
can
have
the
benefit
of
bathing
;
and
from
whence
there
is
a
short
cut
by
sea
to
Italy
,
should
I
find
it
necessary
to
try
the
air
of
Naples
.
  
<EOS>
After
having
been
ill
accommodated
three
days
at
our
inn
,
we
have
at
last
found
commodious
lodgings
,
by
means
of
Mrs
B-
,
a
very
agreeable
French
lady
,
to
whom
we
were
recommended
by
her
husband
,
who
is
my
countryman
,
and
at
present
resident
in
London
.
<EOS>
For
three
guineas
a
month
we
have
the
greatest
part
of
a
house
tolerably
furnished
;
four
bed
-
chambers
on
the
first
floor
,
a
large
parlour
below
,
a
kitchen
,
and
the
use
of
a
cellar
.
  
<EOS>
These
,
I
own
,
are
frivolous
incidents
,
scarce
worth
committing
to
paper
;
but
they
may
serve
to
introduce
observations
of
more
consequence
;
and
in
the
mean
time
I
know
nothing
will
be
indifferent
to
you
,
that
concerns
 
Your
humble
servant
.

BOULOGNE
SUR
MER
,
July
15
,
1763
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
<EOS>
The
custom
-
house
officers
at
Boulogne
,
though
as
alert
,
are
rather
more
civil
than
those
on
your
side
of
the
water
.
<EOS>
I
brought
no
plate
along
with
me
,
but
a
dozen
and
a
half
of
spoons
,
and
a
dozen
teaspoons
<EOS>
:
the
first
being
found
in
one
of
our
portmanteaus
,
when
they
were
examined
at
the
bureau
,
cost
me
seventeen
livres
entree
;
the
others
being
luckily
in
my
servant
's
pocket
,
escaped
duty
free
.
<EOS>
All
wrought
silver
imported
into
France
,
pays
at
the
rate
of
so
much
per
mark
:
therefore
those
who
have
any
quantity
of
plate
,
will
do
well
to
leave
it
behind
them
,
unless
they
can
confide
in
the
dexterity
of
the
shipmasters
;
some
of
whom
will
undertake
to
land
it
without
the
ceremony
of
examination
.
<EOS>
The
ordonnances
of
France
are
so
unfavourable
to
strangers
,
that
they
oblige
them
to
pay
at
the
rate
of
five
per
cent
.
<EOS>
for
all
the
bed
and
table
linen
which
they
bring
into
the
kingdom
,
even
though
it
has
been
used
.
<EOS>
When
my
trunks
arrived
in
a
ship
from
the
river
Thames
,
I
underwent
this
ordeal
:
but
what
gives
me
more
vexation
,
my
books
have
been
stopped
at
the
bureau
;
and
will
be
sent
to
Amiens
at
my
expence
,
to
be
examined
by
the
chambre
syndicale
;
lest
they
should
contain
something
prejudicial
to
the
state
,
or
to
the
religion
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
species
of
oppression
which
one
would
not
expect
to
meet
with
in
France
,
which
piques
itself
on
its
politeness
and
hospitality
:
but
the
truth
is
,
I
know
no
country
in
which
strangers
are
worse
treated
with
respect
to
their
essential
concerns
.
<EOS>
If
a
foreigner
dies
in
France
,
the
king
seizes
all
his
effects
,
even
though
his
heir
should
be
upon
the
spot
;
and
this
tyranny
is
called
the
droit
d'aubaine
founded
at
first
upon
the
supposition
,
that
all
the
estate
of
foreigners
residing
in
France
was
acquired
in
that
kingdom
,
and
that
,
therefore
,
it
would
be
unjust
to
convey
it
to
another
country
.
<EOS>
If
an
English
protestant
goes
to
France
for
the
benefit
of
his
health
,
attended
by
his
wife
or
his
son
,
or
both
,
and
dies
with
effects
in
the
house
to
the
amount
of
a
thousand
guineas
,
the
king
seizes
the
whole
,
the
family
is
left
destitute
,
and
the
body
of
the
deceased
is
denied
christian
burial
.
<EOS>
The
Swiss
,
by
capitulation
,
are
exempted
from
this
despotism
,
and
so
are
the
Scots
,
in
consequence
of
an
ancient
alliance
between
the
two
nations
.
<EOS>
The
same
droit
d'aubaine
is
exacted
by
some
of
the
princes
in
Germany
:
but
it
is
a
great
discouragement
to
commerce
,
and
prejudices
every
country
where
it
is
exercised
,
to
ten
times
the
value
of
what
it
brings
into
the
coffers
of
the
sovereign
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
exceedingly
mortified
at
the
detention
of
my
books
,
which
not
only
deprives
me
of
an
amusement
which
I
can
very
ill
dispense
with
;
but
,
in
all
probability
,
will
expose
me
to
sundry
other
inconveniencies
.
<EOS>
I
must
be
at
the
expence
of
sending
them
sixty
miles
to
be
examined
,
and
run
the
risque
of
their
being
condemned
;
and
,
in
the
mean
time
,
I
may
lose
the
opportunity
of
sending
them
with
my
heavy
baggage
by
sea
to
Bourdeaux
,
to
be
sent
up
the
Garonne
to
Tholouse
,
and
from
thence
transmitted
through
the
canal
of
Languedoc
to
Cette
,
which
is
a
sea
-
port
on
the
Mediterranean
,
about
three
or
four
leagues
from
Montpelier
.
  
<EOS>
For
the
recovery
of
my
books
,
I
had
recourse
to
the
advice
of
my
landlord
,
Mons
B
 
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
handsome
young
fellow
,
about
twenty
-
five
years
of
age
,
and
keeps
house
with
two
maiden
sisters
,
who
are
professed
devotees
.
<EOS>
The
brother
is
a
little
libertine
,
good
natured
and
obliging
;
but
a
true
Frenchman
in
vanity
,
which
is
undoubtedly
the
ruling
passion
of
this
volatile
people
.
<EOS>
He
has
an
inconsiderable
place
under
the
government
,
in
consequence
of
which
he
is
permitted
to
wear
a
sword
,
a
privilege
which
he
does
not
fail
to
use
.
<EOS>
He
is
likewise
receiver
of
the
tythes
of
the
clergy
in
this
district
,
an
office
that
gives
him
a
command
of
money
,
and
he
,
moreover
,
deals
in
the
wine
trade
.
<EOS>
When
I
came
to
his
house
,
he
made
a
parade
of
all
these
advantages
:
he
displayed
his
bags
of
money
,
and
some
old
gold
which
his
father
had
left
him
.
<EOS>
He
described
his
chateau
in
the
country
;
dropped
hints
of
the
fortunes
that
were
settled
upon
mademoiselles
his
sisters
;
boasted
of
his
connexions
at
court
;
and
assured
me
it
was
not
for
my
money
that
he
let
his
lodgings
,
but
altogether
with
a
view
to
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
my
company
.
<EOS>
The
truth
,
when
stript
of
all
embellishments
,
is
this
:
<EOS>
the
sieur
B
  
is
the
son
of
an
honest
bourgeois
lately
dead
,
who
left
him
the
house
,
with
some
stock
in
trade
,
a
little
money
,
and
a
paltry
farm
:
his
sisters
have
about
three
thousand
livres
(
not
quite
140
L
)
apiece
;
the
brother
's
places
are
worth
about
fifty
pounds
a
year
,
and
his
connexions
at
court
are
confined
to
a
commis
or
clerk
in
the
secretary
's
office
,
with
whom
he
corresponds
by
virtue
of
his
employment
.
<EOS>
My
landlord
piques
himself
upon
his
gallantry
and
success
with
the
fair
-
sex
:
<EOS>
he
keeps
a
fille
de
joye
,
and
makes
no
secret
of
his
amours
.
<EOS>
He
told
miss
C
  
<EOS>
the
other
day
,
in
broken
English
,
that
,
in
the
course
of
the
last
year
,
he
had
made
six
bastards
.
<EOS>
He
owned
,
at
the
same
time
,
he
had
sent
them
all
to
the
hospital
;
but
,
now
his
father
is
dead
,
he
would
himself
take
care
of
his
future
productions
.
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
was
no
better
than
a
gasconade
.
<EOS>
Yesterday
the
house
was
in
a
hot
alarm
,
on
account
of
a
new
windfall
of
this
kind
:
the
sisters
were
in
tears
;
the
brother
was
visited
by
the
cure
of
the
parish
;
the
lady
in
the
straw
(
a
sempstress
)
sent
him
the
bantling
in
a
basket
,
and
he
transmitted
it
by
the
carriers
to
the
Enfans
trouves
at
Paris
.
  
<EOS>
But
to
return
from
this
digression
:
<EOS>
Mr
B
  
advised
me
to
send
a
requete
or
petition
to
the
chancellor
of
France
,
that
I
might
obtain
an
order
to
have
my
books
examined
on
the
spot
,
by
the
president
of
Boulogne
,
or
the
procureur
du
roy
,
or
the
sub
-
delegate
of
the
intendance
.
<EOS>
He
recommended
an
advocat
of
his
acquaintance
to
draw
up
the
memoire
,
and
introduced
him
accordingly
;
telling
me
at
the
same
time
,
in
private
,
that
if
he
was
not
a
drunkard
,
he
would
be
at
the
head
of
his
profession
.
<EOS>
He
had
indeed
all
the
outward
signs
of
a
sot
;
a
sleepy
eye
,
a
rubicund
face
,
and
carbuncled
nose
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
be
a
little
out
at
elbows
,
had
marvellous
foul
linen
,
and
his
breeches
were
not
very
sound
:
but
he
assumed
an
air
of
importance
,
was
very
courteous
,
and
very
solemn
.
<EOS>
I
asked
him
if
he
did
not
sometimes
divert
himself
with
the
muse
:
he
smiled
,
and
promised
,
in
a
whisper
,
to
shew
me
some
chansonettes
de
sa
facon
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
he
composed
the
requete
in
my
name
,
which
was
very
pompous
,
very
tedious
,
and
very
abject
.
<EOS>
Such
a
stile
might
perhaps
be
necessary
in
a
native
of
France
;
but
I
did
not
think
it
was
at
all
suitable
to
a
subject
of
Great
-
Britain
.
<EOS>
I
thanked
him
for
the
trouble
he
had
taken
,
as
he
would
receive
no
other
gratification
;
but
when
my
landlord
proposed
to
send
the
memoire
to
his
correspondent
at
Paris
,
to
be
delivered
to
the
chancellor
,
I
told
him
I
had
changed
my
mind
,
and
would
apply
to
the
English
ambassador
.
<EOS>
I
have
accordingly
taken
the
liberty
to
address
myself
to
the
earl
of
H
 
;
and
at
the
same
time
I
have
presumed
to
write
to
the
duchess
of
D
 
,
who
is
now
at
Paris
,
to
entreat
her
grace
's
advice
and
interposition
.
<EOS>
What
effect
these
applications
may
have
,
I
know
not
:
but
<EOS>
the
sieur
B
  
shakes
his
head
,
and
has
told
my
servant
,
in
confidence
,
that
I
am
mistaken
if
I
think
the
English
ambassador
is
as
great
a
man
at
Paris
as
the
chancellor
of
France
.
  
<EOS>
I
ought
to
make
an
apology
for
troubling
you
with
such
an
unentertaining
detail
,
and
consider
that
the
detention
of
my
books
must
be
a
matter
of
very
little
consequence
to
any
body
,
but
to
 
Your
affectionate
humble
servant
.
   
<EOS>
BOULOGNE
,
August

,
1763
.
  
<EOS>
SIR
 
<EOS>
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
kind
enquiries
after
my
health
,
which
has
been
lately
in
a
very
declining
condition
.
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
a
cold
,
caught
a
few
days
after
my
arrival
in
France
,
I
was
seized
with
a
violent
cough
,
attended
with
a
fever
,
and
stitches
in
my
breast
,
which
tormented
me
all
night
long
without
ceasing
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
I
had
a
great
discharge
by
expectoration
,
and
such
a
dejection
of
spirits
as
I
never
felt
before
.
<EOS>
In
this
situation
I
took
a
step
which
may
appear
to
have
been
desperate
.
<EOS>
I
knew
there
was
no
imposthume
in
my
lungs
,
and
I
supposed
the
stitches
were
spasmodical
.
<EOS>
I
was
sensible
that
all
my
complaints
were
originally
derived
from
relaxation
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
hired
a
chaise
,
and
going
to
the
beach
,
about
a
league
from
the
town
,
plunged
into
the
sea
without
hesitation
.
<EOS>
By
this
desperate
remedy
,
I
got
a
fresh
cold
in
my
head
:
but
my
stitches
and
fever
vanished
the
very
first
day
;
and
by
a
daily
repetition
of
the
bath
,
I
have
diminished
my
cough
,
strengthened
my
body
,
and
recovered
my
spirits
.
<EOS>
I
believe
I
should
have
tried
the
same
experiment
,
even
if
there
had
been
an
abscess
in
my
lungs
,
though
such
practice
would
have
been
contrary
to
all
the
rules
of
medicine
:
but
I
am
not
one
of
those
who
implicitly
believe
in
all
the
dogmata
of
physic
.
<EOS>
I
saw
one
of
the
guides
at
Bath
,
the
stoutest
fellow
among
them
,
who
recovered
from
the
last
stage
of
a
consumption
,
by
going
into
the
king
's
bath
,
contrary
to
the
express
injunction
of
his
doctor
.
<EOS>
He
said
,
if
he
must
die
,
the
sooner
the
better
,
as
he
had
nothing
left
for
his
subsistence
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
immediate
death
,
he
found
instant
case
,
and
continued
mending
every
day
,
till
his
health
was
entirely
re
-
established
.
<EOS>
I
myself
drank
the
waters
of
Bath
,
and
bathed
,
in
diametrical
opposition
to
the
opinion
of
some
physicians
there
settled
,
and
found
myself
better
every
day
,
notwithstanding
their
unfavourable
prognostic
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
been
of
the
rigid
fibre
,
full
of
blood
,
subject
to
inflammation
,
I
should
have
followed
a
different
course
.
<EOS>
Our
acquaintance
,
doctor
C
 
,
while
he
actually
spit
up
matter
,
and
rode
out
every
day
for
his
life
,
led
his
horse
to
water
,
at
the
pond
in
Hyde
-
Park
,
one
cold
frosty
morning
,
and
the
beast
,
which
happened
to
be
of
a
hot
constitution
,
plunged
himself
and
his
master
over
head
and
ears
in
the
water
.
<EOS>
The
poor
doctor
hastened
home
,
half
dead
with
fear
,
and
was
put
to
bed
in
the
apprehension
of
a
new
imposthume
;
instead
of
which
,
he
found
himself
exceedingly
recruited
in
his
spirits
,
and
his
appetite
much
mended
.
<EOS>
I
advised
him
to
take
the
hint
,
and
go
into
the
cold
bath
every
morning
;
but
he
did
not
chuse
to
run
any
risque
.
<EOS>
How
cold
water
comes
to
be
such
a
bugbear
,
I
know
not
:
if
I
am
not
mistaken
,
Hippocrates
recommends
immersion
in
cold
water
for
the
gout
;
and
Celsus
expressly
says
,
in
omni
tussi
utilis
est
natatio
:
in
every
cough
swimming
is
of
service
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
conversed
with
a
physician
of
this
place
,
a
sensible
man
,
who
assured
me
he
was
reduced
to
meer
skin
and
bone
by
a
cough
and
hectic
fever
,
when
he
ordered
a
bath
to
be
made
in
his
own
house
,
and
dipped
himself
in
cold
water
every
morning
.
<EOS>
He
at
the
same
time
left
off
drinking
and
swallowing
any
liquid
that
was
warm
.
<EOS>
He
is
now
strong
and
lusty
,
and
even
in
winter
has
no
other
cover
than
a
single
sheet
.
<EOS>
His
notions
about
the
warm
drink
were
a
little
whimsical
:
he
imagined
it
relaxed
the
tone
of
the
stomach
;
and
this
would
undoubtedly
be
the
case
if
it
was
drank
in
large
quantities
,
warmer
than
the
natural
temperature
of
the
blood
.
<EOS>
He
alledged
the
example
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
Ladrone
islands
,
who
never
taste
any
thing
that
is
not
cold
,
and
are
remarkably
healthy
.
<EOS>
But
to
balance
this
argument
I
mentioned
the
Chinese
,
who
scarce
drink
any
thing
but
warm
tea
;
and
the
Laplanders
,
who
drink
nothing
but
warm
water
;
yet
the
people
of
both
these
nations
are
remarkably
strong
,
healthy
,
and
long
-
lived
.
  
<EOS>
You
desire
to
know
the
fate
of
my
books
.
<EOS>
My
lord
H
 
<EOS>
d
is
not
yet
come
to
France
;
but
my
letter
was
transmitted
to
him
from
Paris
;
and
his
lordship
,
with
that
generous
humanity
which
is
peculiar
to
his
character
,
has
done
me
the
honour
to
assure
me
,
under
his
own
hand
,
that
he
has
directed
Mr
N
 
lle

our
resident
at
Paris
,
to
apply
for
an
order
that
my
books
may
be
restored
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
met
with
another
piece
of
good
fortune
,
in
being
introduced
to
general
Paterson
and
his
lady
,
in
their
way
to
England
from
Nice
,
where
the
general
has
been
many
years
commandant
for
the
king
of
Sardinia
.
<EOS>
You
must
have
heard
of
this
gentleman
,
who
has
not
only
eminently
distinguished
himself
,
by
his
courage
and
conduct
as
an
officer
;
but
also
by
his
probity
and
humanity
in
the
exercise
,
of
his
office
,
and
by
his
remarkable
hospitality
to
all
strangers
,
especially
the
subjects
of
Great
-
Britain
,
whose
occasions
called
them
to
the
place
where
he
commanded
.
<EOS>
Being
pretty
far
advanced
in
years
,
he
begged
leave
to
resign
,
that
he
might
spend
the
evening
of
his
days
in
his
own
country
;
and
his
Sardinian
majesty
granted
his
request
with
regret
,
after
having
honoured
him
with
very
particular
marks
of
approbation
and
esteem
.
<EOS>
The
general
talks
so
favourably
of
the
climate
of
Nice
,
with
respect
to
disorders
of
the
breast
,
that
I
am
now
determined
to
go
thither
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
happy
for
me
<EOS>
had
he
continued
in
his
government
.
<EOS>
I
think
myself
still
very
fortunate
,
in
having
obtained
of
him
a
letter
of
recommendation
to
the
English
consul
at
Nice
,
together
with
directions
how
to
travel
through
the
South
of
France
.
<EOS>
I
propose
to
begin
my
journey
some
time
next
month
,
when
the
weather
will
be
temperate
to
the
southward
;
and
in
the
wine
countries
I
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
the
vintage
,
which
is
always
a
season
of
festivity
among
all
ranks
of
people
.
  
<EOS>
You
have
been
very
much
mis
-
informed
,
by
the
person
who
compared
Boulogne
to
Wapping
:
he
did
a
manifest
injustice
to
this
place
which
is
a
large
agreeable
town
,
with
broad
open
streets
,
excellently
paved
;
and
the
houses
are
of
stone
,
well
built
and
commodious
.
<EOS>
The
number
of
inhabitants
may
amount
to
sixteen
thousand
.
<EOS>
You
know
this
was
generally
supposed
to
be
the
portus
Itius
,
and
Gessoriacum
of
the
antients
:
though
it
is
now
believed
that
the
portus
Itius
,
from
whence
Caesar
sailed
to
Britain
,
is
a
place
called
Whitsand
,
about
half
way
between
this
place
and
Calais
.
<EOS>
Boulogne
is
the
capital
of
the
Boulonnois
,
a
district
extending
about
twelve
leagues
,
ruled
by
a
governor
independent
of
the
governor
of
Picardy
;
of
which
province
,
however
,
this
country
forms
a
part
.
<EOS>
The
present
governor
is
the
duc
d'Aumout
.
<EOS>
The
town
of
Boulogne
is
the
see
of
a
bishop
suffragan
of
Rheims
,
whose
revenue
amounts
to
about
four
-
and
-
twenty
thousand
livres
,
or
one
thousand
pounds
sterling
.
<EOS>
It
is
also
the
seat
of
a
seneschal
's
court
,
from
whence
an
appeal
lies
to
the
parliament
of
Paris
;
and
thither
all
condemned
criminals
are
sent
,
to
have
their
sentence
confirmed
or
reversed
.
<EOS>
Here
is
likewise
a
bailiwick
,
and
a
court
of
admiralty
.
<EOS>
The
military
jurisdiction
of
the
city
belongs
to
a
commandant
appointed
by
the
king
,
a
sort
of
sinecure
bestowed
upon
some
old
officer
.
<EOS>
His
appointments
are
very
inconsiderable
:
he
resides
in
the
Upper
Town
,
and
his
garrison
at
present
consists
of
a
few
hundreds
of
invalids
.
  
<EOS>
Boulogne
is
divided
into
the
Upper
and
Lower
Towns
.
<EOS>
The
former
is
a
kind
of
citadel
,
about
a
short
mile
in
circumference
,
situated
on
a
rising
ground
,
surrounded
by
a
high
wall
and
rampart
,
planted
with
rows
of
trees
,
which
form
a
delightful
walk
.
<EOS>
It
commands
a
fine
view
of
the
country
and
Lower
Town
;
and
in
clear
weather
the
coast
of
England
,
from
Dover
to
Folkstone
,
appears
so
plain
,
that
one
would
imagine
it
was
within
four
or
five
leagues
of
the
French
shore
.
<EOS>
The
Upper
Town
was
formerly
fortified
with
outworks
,
which
are
now
in
ruins
.
<EOS>
Here
is
a
square
,
a
town
-
house
,
the
cathedral
,
and
two
or
three
convents
of
nuns
;
in
one
of
which
there
are
several
English
girls
,
sent
hither
for
their
education
.
<EOS>
The
smallness
of
the
expence
encourages
parents
to
send
their
children
abroad
to
these
seminaries
,
where
they
learn
scarce
any
thing
that
is
useful
but
the
French
language
;
but
they
never
fail
to
imbibe
prejudices
against
the
protestant
religion
,
and
generally
return
enthusiastic
converts
to
the
religion
of
Rome
.
<EOS>
This
conversion
always
generates
a
contempt
for
,
and
often
an
aversion
to
,
their
own
country
.
<EOS>
Indeed
it
can
not
reasonably
be
expected
that
people
of
weak
minds
,
addicted
to
superstition
,
should
either
love
or
esteem
those
whom
they
are
taught
to
consider
as
reprobated
heretics
.
<EOS>
Ten
pounds
a
year
is
the
usual
pension
in
these
convents
;
but
I
have
been
informed
by
a
French
lady
who
had
her
education
in
one
of
them
,
that
nothing
can
be
more
wretched
than
their
entertainment
.
  
<EOS>
The
civil
magistracy
of
Boulogne
consists
of
a
mayor
and
echevins
;
and
this
is
the
case
in
almost
all
the
towns
of
France
.
  
<EOS>
The
Lower
Town
is
continued
from
the
gate
of
the
Upper
Town
,
down
the
slope
of
a
hill
,
as
far
as
the
harbour
,
stretching
on
both
sides
to
a
large
extent
,
and
is
much
more
considerable
than
the
Upper
,
with
respect
to
the
beauty
of
the
streets
,
the
convenience
of
the
houses
,
and
the
number
and
wealth
of
the
inhabitants
.
<EOS>
These
,
however
,
are
all
merchants
,
or
bourgeoise
,
for
the
noblesse
or
gentry
live
all
together
in
the
Upper
Town
,
and
never
mix
with
the
others
.
<EOS>
The
harbour
of
Boulogne
is
at
the
mouth
of
the
small
river
,
or
rather
rivulet
Liane
,
which
is
so
shallow
,
that
the
children
wade
through
it
at
low
water
.
<EOS>
As
the
tide
makes
,
the
sea
flows
in
,
and
forms
a
pretty
extensive
harbour
,
which
,
however
,
admits
nothing
but
small
vessels
.
<EOS>
It
is
contracted
at
the
mouth
by
two
stone
jetties
or
piers
,
which
seem
to
have
been
constructed
by
some
engineer
,
very
little
acquainted
with
this
branch
of
his
profession
;
for
they
are
carried
out
in
such
a
manner
,
as
to
collect
a
bank
of
sand
just
at
the
entrance
of
the
harbour
.
<EOS>
The
road
is
very
open
and
unsafe
,
and
the
surf
very
high
when
the
wind
blows
from
the
sea
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
fortification
near
the
harbour
,
except
a
paltry
fort
mounting
about
twenty
guns
,
built
in
the
last
war
by
the
prince
de
Cruy
,
upon
a
rock
about
a
league
to
the
eastward
of
Boulogne
.
<EOS>
It
appears
to
be
situated
in
such
a
manner
,
that
it
can
neither
offend
,
nor
be
offended
.
<EOS>
If
the
depth
of
water
would
admit
a
forty
or
fifty
gun
ship
to
lie
within
cannon
-
shot
of
it
,
I
apprehend
it
might
be
silenced
in
half
an
hour
;
but
,
in
all
probability
,
there
will
be
no
vestiges
of
it
at
the
next
rupture
between
the
two
crowns
.
<EOS>
It
is
surrounded
every
day
by
the
sea
,
at
high
water
;
and
when
it
blows
a
fresh
gale
towards
the
shore
,
the
waves
break
over
the
top
of
it
,
to
the
terror
and
astonishment
of
the
garrison
,
who
have
been
often
heard
crying
piteously
for
assistance
.
<EOS>
I
am
persuaded
,
that
it
will
one
day
disappear
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
.
<EOS>
The
neighbourhood
of
this
fort
,
which
is
a
smooth
sandy
beach
,
I
have
chosen
for
my
bathing
place
.
<EOS>
The
road
to
it
is
agreeable
and
romantic
,
lying
through
pleasant
cornfields
,
skirted
by
open
downs
,
where
there
is
a
rabbit
warren
,
and
great
plenty
of
the
birds
so
much
admired
at
Tunbridge
under
the
name
of
wheat
-
ears
.
<EOS>
By
the
bye
,
this
is
a
pleasant
corruption
of
white
-
a
-
se
,
the
translation
of
their
French
name
cul
-
blanc
,
taken
from
their
colour
for
they
are
actually
white
towards
the
tail
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
the
top
of
a
high
rock
,
which
overlooks
the
harbour
,
are
the
remains
of
an
old
fortification
,
which
is
indiscriminately
called
,
Tour
d'ordre
,
and
Julius
Caesar
's
fort
.
<EOS>
The
original
tower
was
a
light
-
house
built
by
Claudius
Caesar
,
denominated
Turris
ardens
,
from
the
fire
burned
in
it
;
and
this
the
French
have
corrupted
into
Tour
d'ordre
;
but
no
vestiges
of
this
Roman
work
remain
;
what
we
now
see
,
are
the
ruins
of
a
castle
built
by
Charlemagne
.
<EOS>
I
know
of
no
other
antiquity
at
Boulogne
,
except
an
old
vault
in
the
Upper
Town
,
now
used
as
a
magazine
,
which
is
said
to
be
part
of
an
antient
temple
dedicated
to
Isis
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
other
side
of
the
harbour
,
opposite
to
the
Lower
Town
,
there
is
a
house
built
,
at
a
considerable
expence
,
by
a
general
officer
,
who
lost
his
life
in
the
late
war
.
<EOS>
Never
was
situation
more
inconvenient
,
unpleasant
,
and
unhealthy
.
<EOS>
It
stands
on
the
edge
of
an
ugly
morass
formed
by
the
stagnant
water
left
by
the
tide
in
its
retreat
:
the
very
walks
of
the
garden
are
so
moist
,
that
,
in
the
driest
weather
,
no
person
can
make
a
tour
of
it
,
without
danger
of
the
rheumatism
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
the
house
is
altogether
inaccessible
,
except
at
low
water
,
and
even
then
the
carriage
must
cross
the
harbour
,
the
wheels
up
to
the
axle
-
tree
in
mud
:
<EOS>
nay
,
the
tide
rushes
in
so
fast
,
that
unless
you
seize
the
time
to
a
minute
,
you
will
be
in
danger
of
perishing
.
<EOS>
The
apartments
of
this
house
are
elegantly
fitted
up
,
but
very
small
;
and
the
garden
,
notwithstanding
its
unfavourable
situation
,
affords
a
great
quantity
of
good
fruit
.
<EOS>
The
ooze
,
impregnated
with
sea
salt
,
produces
,
on
this
side
of
the
harbour
,
an
incredible
quantity
of
the
finest
samphire
I
ever
saw
.
<EOS>
The
French
call
it
passe
-
pierre
;
and
I
suspect
its
English
name
is
a
corruption
of
sang
-
pierre
.
<EOS>
It
is
generally
found
on
the
faces
of
bare
rocks
that
overhang
the
sea
,
by
the
spray
of
which
it
is
nourished
.
<EOS>
As
it
grew
upon
a
naked
rock
,
without
any
appearance
of
soil
,
it
might
be
naturally
enough
called
sang
du
pierre
,
or
sangpierre
,
blood
of
the
rock
;
and
hence
the
name
samphire
.
<EOS>
On
the
same
side
of
the
harbour
there
is
another
new
house
,
neatly
built
,
belonging
to
a
gentleman
who
has
obtained
a
grant
from
the
king
of
some
ground
which
was
always
overflowed
at
high
water
.
<EOS>
He
has
raised
dykes
at
a
considerable
expence
,
to
exclude
the
tide
,
and
if
he
can
bring
his
project
to
bear
,
he
will
not
only
gain
a
good
estate
for
himself
,
but
also
improve
the
harbour
,
by
increasing
the
depth
at
high
-
water
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
Lower
Town
of
Boulogne
there
are
several
religious
houses
,
particularly
a
seminary
,
a
convent
of
Cordeliers
,
and
another
of
Capuchins
.
<EOS>
This
last
,
having
fallen
to
decay
,
was
some
years
ago
repaired
,
chiefly
by
the
charity
of
British
travellers
,
collected
by
father
Graeme
,
a
native
of
North
-
Britain
,
who
had
been
an
officer
in
the
army
of
king
James
II
and
is
said
to
have
turned
monk
of
this
mendicant
order
,
by
way
of
voluntary
penance
,
for
having
killed
his
friend
in
a
duel
.
<EOS>
Be
that
as
it
may
,
he
was
a
well
-
bred
,
sensible
man
,
of
a
very
exemplary
life
and
conversation
;
and
his
memory
is
much
revered
in
this
place
.
<EOS>
Being
superior
of
the
convent
,
he
caused
the
British
arms
to
be
put
up
in
the
church
,
as
a
mark
of
gratitude
for
the
benefactions
received
from
our
nation
.
<EOS>
I
often
walk
in
the
garden
of
the
convent
,
the
walls
of
which
are
washed
by
the
sea
at
high
-
water
.
<EOS>
At
the
bottom
of
the
garden
is
a
little
private
grove
,
separated
from
it
by
a
high
wall
,
with
a
door
of
communication
;
and
hither
the
Capuchins
retire
,
when
they
are
disposed
for
contemplation
.
<EOS>
About
two
years
ago
,
this
place
was
said
to
be
converted
to
a
very
different
use
.
<EOS>
There
was
among
the
monks
one
pere
Charles
,
a
lusty
friar
,
of
whom
the
people
tell
strange
stories
.
<EOS>
Some
young
women
of
the
town
were
seen
mounting
over
the
wall
,
by
a
ladder
of
ropes
,
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
;
and
there
was
an
unusual
crop
of
bastards
that
season
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
pere
Charles
and
his
companions
gave
such
scandal
,
that
the
whole
fraternity
was
changed
;
and
now
the
nest
is
occupied
by
another
flight
of
these
birds
of
passage
.
<EOS>
If
one
of
our
privateers
had
kidnapped
a
Capuchin
during
the
war
,
and
exhibited
him
,
in
his
habit
,
as
a
shew
in
London
,
he
would
have
proved
a
good
prize
to
the
captors
;
for
I
know
not
a
more
uncouth
and
grotesque
animal
,
than
an
old
Capuchin
in
the
habit
of
his
order
.
<EOS>
A
friend
of
mine
(
a
Swiss
officer
)
told
me
,
that
a
peasant
in
his
country
used
to
weep
bitterly
,
whenever
a
certain
Capuchin
mounted
the
pulpit
to
hold
forth
to
the
people
.
<EOS>
The
good
father
took
notice
of
this
man
,
and
believed
he
was
touched
by
the
finger
of
the
Lord
.
<EOS>
He
exhorted
him
to
encourage
these
accessions
of
grace
,
and
at
the
same
time
to
be
of
good
comfort
,
as
having
received
such
marks
of
the
divine
favour
.
<EOS>
The
man
still
continued
to
weep
,
as
before
,
every
time
the
monk
preached
;
and
at
last
the
Capuchin
insisted
upon
knowing
what
it
was
,
in
his
discourse
or
appearance
,
that
made
such
an
impression
upon
his
heart
"
Ah
,
father
!
<EOS>
(
cried
the
peasant
)
<EOS>
I
never
see
you
<EOS>
but
I
think
of
a
venerable
goat
,
which
I
lost
at
Easter
.
<EOS>
We
were
bred
up
together
in
the
same
family
.
<EOS>
He
was
the
very
picture
of
your
reverence
 
one
would
swear
you
were
brothers
.
<EOS>
Poor
Baudouin
!
<EOS>
he
died
of
a
fall
 
rest
his
soul
!
<EOS>
I
would
willingly
pay
for
a
couple
of
masses
to
pray
him
out
of
purgatory
.
"
  
<EOS>
Among
other
public
edifices
at
Boulogne
,
there
is
an
hospital
,
or
workhouse
,
which
seems
to
be
established
upon
a
very
good
foundation
.
<EOS>
It
maintains
several
hundreds
of
poor
people
,
who
are
kept
constantly
at
work
,
according
to
their
age
and
abilities
,
in
making
thread
,
all
sorts
of
lace
,
a
kind
of
catgut
,
and
in
knitting
stockings
.
<EOS>
It
is
under
the
direction
of
the
bishop
;
and
the
see
is
at
present
filled
by
a
prelate
of
great
piety
and
benevolence
,
though
a
little
inclining
to
bigotry
and
fanaticism
.
<EOS>
The
churches
in
this
town
are
but
indifferently
built
,
and
poorly
ornamented
.
<EOS>
There
is
not
one
picture
in
the
place
worth
looking
at
,
nor
indeed
does
there
seem
to
be
the
least
taste
for
the
liberal
arts
.
  
<EOS>
In
my
next
,
I
shall
endeavour
to
satisfy
you
in
the
other
articles
you
desire
to
know

BOULOGNE

<EOS>
SIR
,
 
I
am
infinitely
obliged
to
D
H
  
for
the
favourable
manner
in
which
he
has
mentioned
me
to
the
earl
of
H
  
<EOS>
I
have
at
last
recovered
my
books
,
by
virtue
of
a
particular
order
to
the
director
of
the
douane
,
procured
by
the
application
of
the
English
resident
to
the
French
ministry
.
<EOS>
I
am
now
preparing
for
my
long
journey
;
but
,
before
I
leave
this
place
,
I
shall
send
you
the
packet
I
mentioned
,
by
Meriton
.
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
-
while
I
must
fulfil
my
promise
in
communicating
the
observations
I
have
had
occasion
to
make
upon
this
town
and
country
.
  
<EOS>
The
air
of
Boulogne
is
cold
and
moist
,
and
,
I
believe
,
of
consequence
unhealthy
.
<EOS>
Last
winter
the
frost
,
which
continued
six
weeks
in
London
,
lasted
here
eight
weeks
without
intermission
;
and
the
cold
was
so
intense
,
that
,
in
the
garden
of
the
Capuchins
,
it
split
the
bark
of
several
elms
from
top
to
bottom
.
<EOS>
On
our
arrival
here
we
found
all
kinds
of
fruit
more
backward
than
in
England
.
<EOS>
The
frost
,
in
its
progress
to
Britain
,
is
much
weakened
in
crossing
the
sea
.
<EOS>
The
atmosphere
,
impregnated
with
saline
particles
,
resists
the
operation
of
freezing
.
<EOS>
Hence
,
in
severe
winters
,
all
places
near
the
sea
-
side
are
less
cold
than
more
inland
districts
.
<EOS>
This
is
the
reason
why
the
winter
is
often
more
mild
at
Edinburgh
than
at
London
.
<EOS>
A
very
great
degree
of
cold
is
required
to
freeze
salt
water
.
<EOS>
Indeed
it
will
not
freeze
at
all
,
until
it
has
deposited
all
its
salt
.
<EOS>
It
is
now
generally
allowed
among
philosophers
,
that
water
is
no
more
than
ice
thawed
by
heat
,
either
solar
,
or
subterranean
,
or
both
;
and
that
this
heat
being
expelled
,
it
would
return
to
its
natural
consistence
.
<EOS>
This
being
the
case
,
nothing
else
is
required
for
the
freezing
of
water
,
than
a
certain
degree
of
cold
,
which
may
be
generated
by
the
help
of
salt
,
or
spirit
of
nitre
,
even
under
the
line
.
<EOS>
I
would
propose
,
therefore
,
that
an
apparatus
of
this
sort
should
be
provided
in
every
ship
that
goes
to
sea
;
and
in
case
there
should
be
a
deficiency
of
fresh
water
on
board
,
the
seawater
may
be
rendered
potable
,
by
being
first
converted
into
ice
.
  
<EOS>
The
air
of
Boulogne
is
not
only
loaded
with
a
great
evaporation
from
the
sea
,
increased
by
strong
gales
of
wind
from
the
West
and
South
-
West
,
which
blow
almost
continually
during
the
greatest
part
of
the
year
;
but
it
is
also
subject
to
putrid
vapours
,
arising
from
the
low
marshy
ground
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
harbour
,
which
is
every
tide
overflowed
with
seawater
.
<EOS>
This
may
be
one
cause
of
the
scrofula
and
rickets
,
which
are
two
prevailing
disorders
among
the
children
in
Boulogne
.
<EOS>
But
I
believe
the
former
is
more
owing
to
the
water
used
in
the
Lower
Town
,
which
is
very
hard
and
unwholsome
.
<EOS>
It
curdles
with
soap
,
gives
a
red
colour
to
the
meat
that
is
boiled
in
it
,
and
,
when
drank
by
strangers
,
never
fails
to
occasion
pains
in
the
stomach
and
bowels
;
nay
,
sometimes
produces
dysenteries
.
<EOS>
In
all
appearance
it
is
impregnated
with
nitre
,
if
not
with
something
more
mischievous
:
we
know
that
mundic
,
or
pyrites
,
very
often
contains
a
proportion
of
arsenic
,
mixed
with
sulphur
,
vitriol
,
and
mercury
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
partakes
of
the
acid
of
some
coal
mine
;
for
there
are
coal
works
in
this
district
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
well
of
purging
water
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
the
Upper
Town
,
to
which
the
inhabitants
resort
in
the
morning
,
as
the
people
of
London
go
to
the
Dog
-
and
-
duck
,
in
St
George
's
fields
.
<EOS>
There
is
likewise
a
fountain
of
excellent
water
,
hard
by
the
cathedral
,
in
the
Upper
Town
,
from
whence
I
am
daily
supplied
at
a
small
expence
.
<EOS>
Some
modern
chemists
affirm
,
that
no
saline
chalybeate
waters
can
exist
,
except
in
the
neighbourhood
of
coal
damps
;
and
that
nothing
can
be
more
mild
,
and
gentle
,
and
friendly
to
the
constitution
,
than
the
said
damps
:
<EOS>
but
I
know
that
the
place
where
I
was
bred
stands
upon
a
zonic
of
coal
;
that
the
water
which
the
inhabitants
generally
use
is
hard
and
brackish
;
and
that
the
people
are
remarkably
subject
to
the
king
's
evil
and
consumption
.
<EOS>
These
I
would
impute
to
the
bad
water
,
impregnated
with
the
vitriol
and
brine
of
coal
,
as
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
of
the
air
that
should
render
such
distempers
endemial
.
<EOS>
That
the
air
of
Boulogne
encourages
putrefaction
,
appears
from
the
effect
it
has
upon
butcher
's
meat
,
which
,
though
the
season
is
remarkably
cold
,
we
can
hardly
keep
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
in
the
coolest
part
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Living
here
is
pretty
reasonable
;
and
the
markets
are
tolerably
supplied
.
<EOS>
The
beef
is
neither
fat
nor
firm
;
but
very
good
for
soup
,
which
is
the
only
use
the
French
make
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
veal
is
not
so
white
,
nor
so
well
fed
,
as
the
English
veal
;
but
it
is
more
juicy
,
and
better
tasted
.
<EOS>
The
mutton
and
pork
are
very
good
.
<EOS>
We
buy
our
poultry
alive
,
and
fatten
them
at
home
.
<EOS>
Here
are
excellent
turkies
,
and
no
want
of
game
:
the
hares
,
in
particular
,
are
very
large
,
juicy
,
and
high
-
flavoured
.
<EOS>
The
best
part
of
the
fish
caught
on
this
coast
is
sent
post
to
Paris
,
in
chasse
-
marines
,
by
a
company
of
contractors
,
like
those
of
Hastings
in
Sussex
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
we
have
excellent
soles
,
skaite
,
flounders
and
whitings
,
and
sometimes
mackarel
.
<EOS>
The
oysters
are
very
large
,
coarse
,
and
rank
.
<EOS>
There
is
very
little
fish
caught
on
the
French
coast
,
because
the
shallows
run
a
great
way
from
the
shore
;
and
the
fish
live
chiefly
in
deep
water
:
for
this
reason
the
fishermen
go
a
great
way
out
to
sea
,
sometimes
even
as
far
as
the
coast
of
England
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
all
the
haste
the
contractors
can
make
,
their
fish
in
the
summer
is
very
often
spoiled
before
it
arrives
at
Paris
;
and
this
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
,
considering
the
length
of
the
way
,
which
is
near
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
.
<EOS>
At
best
it
must
be
in
such
a
mortified
condition
,
that
no
other
people
,
except
the
negroes
on
the
coast
of
Guinea
,
would
feed
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
wine
commonly
drank
at
Boulogne
comes
from
Auxerre
,
is
very
small
and
meagre
,
and
may
be
had
from
five
to
eight
sols
a
bottle
;
that
is
,
from
two
-
pence
halfpenny
to
fourpence
.
<EOS>
The
French
inhabitants
drink
no
good
wine
;
nor
is
there
any
to
be
had
,
unless
you
have
recourse
to
the
British
wine
-
merchants
here
established
,
who
deal
in
Bourdeaux
wines
,
brought
hither
by
sea
for
the
London
market
.
<EOS>
I
have
very
good
claret
from
a
friend
,
at
the
rate
of
fifteen
-
pence
sterling
a
bottle
;
and
excellent
small
beer
as
reasonable
as
in
England
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
there
is
a
drop
of
generous
Burgundy
in
the
place
;
and
the
aubergistes
impose
upon
us
shamefully
,
when
they
charge
it
at
two
livres
a
bottle
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
small
white
wine
,
called
preniac
,
which
is
very
agreeable
and
very
cheap
.
<EOS>
All
the
brandy
which
I
have
seen
in
Boulogne
is
new
,
fiery
,
and
still
-
burnt
.
<EOS>
This
is
the
trash
which
the
smugglers
import
into
England
:
they
have
it
for
about
ten
-
pence
a
gallon
.
<EOS>
Butcher
's
meat
is
sold
for
five
sols
,
or
two
-
pence
halfpenny
a
pound
,
and
the
pound
here
consists
of
eighteen
ounces
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
young
turkey
for
thirty
sols
;
a
hare
for
four
-
and
-
twenty
;
a
couple
of
chickens
for
twenty
sols
,
and
a
couple
of
good
soles
for
the
same
price
.
<EOS>
Before
we
left
England
,
we
were
told
that
there
was
no
fruit
in
Boulogne
;
but
we
have
found
ourselves
agreeably
disappointed
in
this
particular
.
<EOS>
The
place
is
well
supplied
with
strawberries
,
cherries
,
gooseberries
,
corinths
,
peaches
,
apricots
,
and
excellent
pears
.
<EOS>
I
have
eaten
more
fruit
this
season
,
than
I
have
done
for
several
years
.
<EOS>
There
are
many
well
-
cultivated
gardens
in
the
skirts
of
the
town
;
particularly
one
belonging
to
our
friend
Mrs
B
 
,
where
we
often
drink
tea
in
a
charming
summer
-
house
built
on
a
rising
ground
,
which
commands
a
delightful
prospect
of
the
sea
.
<EOS>
We
have
many
obligations
to
this
good
lady
,
who
is
a
kind
neighbour
,
an
obliging
friend
,
and
a
most
agreeable
companion
:
she
speaks
English
prettily
,
and
is
greatly
attached
to
the
people
and
the
customs
of
our
nation
.
<EOS>
They
use
wood
for
their
common
fewel
,
though
,
if
I
were
to
live
at
Boulogne
,
I
would
mix
it
with
coal
,
which
this
country
affords
.
<EOS>
Both
the
wood
and
the
coal
are
reasonable
enough
.
<EOS>
I
am
certain
that
a
man
may
keep
house
in
Boulogne
for
about
one
half
of
what
it
will
cost
him
in
London
;
and
this
is
said
to
be
one
of
the
dearest
places
in
France
.
  
<EOS>
The
adjacent
country
is
very
agreeable
,
diversified
with
hill
and
dale
,
corn
-
fields
,
woods
,
and
meadows
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
forest
of
a
considerable
extent
,
that
begins
about
a
short
league
from
the
Upper
Town
:
it
belongs
to
the
king
,
and
the
wood
is
farmed
to
different
individuals
.
  
<EOS>
In
point
of
agriculture
,
the
people
in
this
neighbourhood
seem
to
have
profited
by
the
example
of
the
English
.
<EOS>
Since
I
was
last
in
France
,
fifteen
years
ago
,
a
good
number
of
inclosures
and
plantations
have
been
made
in
the
English
fashion

<EOS>
There
is
a
good
many
tolerable
country
-
houses
,
within
a
few
miles
of
Boulogne
;
but
mostly
empty
.
<EOS>
I
was
offered
a
compleat
house
,
with
a
garden
of
four
acres
well
laid
out
,
and
two
fields
for
grass
or
hay
,
about
a
mile
from
the
town
,
for
four
hundred
livres
,
about
seventeen
pounds
a
year
:
it
is
partly
furnished
,
stands
in
an
agreeable
situation
,
with
a
fine
prospect
of
the
sea
,
and
was
lately
occupied
by
a
Scotch
nobleman
,
who
is
in
the
service
of
France
.
  
<EOS>
To
judge
from
appearance
,
the
people
of
Boulogne
are
descended
from
the
Flemings
,
who
formerly
possessed
this
country
;
for
,
a
great
many
of
the
present
inhabitants
have
fine
skins
,
fair
hair
,
and
florid
complexions
;
very
different
from
the
natives
of
France
in
general
,
who
are
distinguished
by
black
hair
,
brown
skins
,
and
swarthy
faces
.
<EOS>
The
people
of
the
Boulonnois
enjoy
some
extraordinary
privileges
,
and
,
in
particular
,
are
exempted
from
the
gabelle
or
duties
upon
salt
:
<EOS>
how
they
deserved
this
mark
of
favour
,
I
do
not
know
;
but
they
seem
to
have
a
spirit
of
independence
among
them
,
are
very
ferocious
,
and
much
addicted
to
revenge
.
<EOS>
Many
barbarous
murders
are
committed
,
both
in
the
town
and
country
;
and
the
peasants
,
from
motives
of
envy
and
resentment
,
frequently
set
their
neighbours
'
houses
on
fire
.
<EOS>
Several
instances
of
this
kind
have
happened
in
the
course
of
the
last
year
.
<EOS>
The
interruption
which
is
given
,
in
arbitrary
governments
,
to
the
administration
of
justice
,
by
the
interposition
of
the
great
,
has
always
a
bad
effect
upon
the
morals
of
the
common
people
.
<EOS>
The
peasants
too
are
often
rendered
desperate
and
savage
,
by
the
misery
they
suffer
from
the
oppression
and
tyranny
of
their
landlords
.
<EOS>
In
this
neighbourhood
the
labouring
people
are
ill
lodged
and
wretchedly
fed
;
and
they
have
no
idea
of
cleanliness
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
substantial
burgher
in
the
High
Town
,
who
was
some
years
ago
convicted
of
a
most
barbarous
murder
.
<EOS>
He
received
sentence
to
be
broke
alive
upon
the
wheel
;
but
was
pardoned
by
the
interposition
of
the
governor
of
the
county
,
and
carries
on
his
business
as
usual
in
the
face
of
the
whole
community
.
<EOS>
A
furious
abbe
,
being
refused
orders
by
the
bishop
,
on
account
of
his
irregular
life
,
took
an
opportunity
to
stab
the
prelate
with
a
knife
,
one
Sunday
,
as
he
walked
out
of
the
cathedral
.
<EOS>
The
good
bishop
desired
he
might
be
permitted
to
escape
;
but
it
was
thought
proper
to
punish
,
with
the
utmost
severity
,
such
an
atrocious
attempt
.
<EOS>
He
was
accordingly
apprehended
,
and
,
though
the
wound
was
not
mortal
,
condemned
to
be
broke
.
<EOS>
When
this
dreadful
sentence
was
executed
,
he
cried
out
,
that
it
was
hard
he
should
undergo
such
torments
,
for
having
wounded
a
worthless
priest
,
by
whom
he
had
been
injured
,
while
such
-
a
-
one
(
naming
the
burgher
mentioned
above
)
lived
in
ease
and
security
,
after
having
brutally
murdered
a
poor
man
,
and
a
helpless
woman
big
with
child
,
who
had
not
given
him
the
least
provocation
.
  
<EOS>
The
inhabitants
of
Boulogne
may
be
divided
into
three
classes
;
the
noblesse
or
gentry
,
the
burghers
,
and
the
canaille
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mention
the
clergy
,
and
the
people
belonging
to
the
law
,
because
I
shall
occasionally
trouble
you
with
my
thoughts
upon
the
religion
and
ecclesiastics
of
this
country
;
and
as
for
the
lawyers
,
exclusive
of
their
profession
,
they
may
be
considered
as
belonging
to
one
or
other
of
these
divisions
.
<EOS>
The
noblesse
are
vain
,
proud
,
poor
,
and
slothful
.
<EOS>
Very
few
of
them
have
above
six
thousand
livres
a
year
,
which
may
amount
to
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
sterling
;
and
many
of
them
have
not
half
this
revenue
.
<EOS>
I
think
there
is
one
heiress
,
said
to
be
worth
one
hundred
thousand
livres
,
about
four
thousand
two
hundred
pounds
;
but
then
her
jewels
,
her
cloaths
,
and
even
her
linen
,
are
reckoned
part
of
this
fortune
.
<EOS>
The
noblesse
have
not
the
common
sense
to
reside
at
their
houses
in
the
country
,
where
,
by
farming
their
own
grounds
,
they
might
live
at
a
small
expence
,
and
improve
their
estates
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
They
allow
their
country
houses
to
go
to
decay
,
and
their
gardens
and
fields
to
waste
;
and
reside
in
dark
holes
in
the
Upper
Town
of
Boulogne
without
light
,
air
,
or
convenience
.
<EOS>
There
they
starve
within
doors
,
that
they
may
have
wherewithal
to
purchase
fine
cloaths
,
and
appear
dressed
once
a
day
in
the
church
,
or
on
the
rampart
.
<EOS>
They
have
no
education
,
no
taste
for
reading
,
no
housewifery
,
nor
indeed
any
earthly
occupation
,
but
that
of
dressing
their
hair
,
and
adorning
their
bodies
.
<EOS>
They
hate
walking
,
and
would
never
go
abroad
,
if
they
were
not
stimulated
by
the
vanity
of
being
seen
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
except
indeed
those
who
turn
devotees
,
and
spend
the
greatest
part
of
their
time
with
the
priest
,
either
at
church
or
in
their
own
houses
.
<EOS>
Other
amusements
they
have
none
in
this
place
,
except
private
parties
of
card
-
playing
,
which
are
far
from
being
expensive
.
<EOS>
Nothing
can
be
more
parsimonious
than
the
oeconomy
of
these
people
:
they
live
upon
soupe
and
bouille
,
fish
and
sallad
:
they
never
think
of
giving
dinners
,
or
entertaining
their
friends
;
they
even
save
the
expence
of
coffee
and
tea
,
though
both
are
very
cheap
at
Boulogne
.
<EOS>
They
presume
that
every
person
drinks
coffee
at
home
,
immediately
after
dinner
,
which
is
always
over
by
one
o'clock
;
and
,
in
lieu
of
tea
in
the
afternoon
,
they
treat
with
a
glass
of
sherbet
,
or
capillaire
.
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
I
know
not
a
more
insignificant
set
of
mortals
than
the
noblesse
of
Boulogne
;
helpless
in
themselves
,
and
useless
to
the
community
;
without
dignity
,
sense
,
or
sentiment
;
contemptible
from
pride
.
<EOS>
and
ridiculous
from
vanity
.
<EOS>
They
pretend
to
be
jealous
of
their
rank
,
and
will
entertain
no
correspondence
with
the
merchants
,
whom
they
term
plebeians
.
<EOS>
They
likewise
keep
at
a
great
distance
from
strangers
,
on
pretence
of
a
delicacy
in
the
article
of
punctilio
:
but
,
as
I
am
informed
,
this
stateliness
is
in
a
great
measure
affected
,
in
order
to
conceal
their
poverty
,
which
would
appear
to
greater
disadvantage
,
if
they
admitted
of
a
more
familiar
communication
.
<EOS>
Considering
the
vivacity
of
the
French
people
,
one
would
imagine
they
could
not
possibly
lead
such
an
insipid
life
,
altogether
unanimated
by
society
,
or
diversion
.
<EOS>
True
it
is
,
the
only
profane
diversions
of
this
place
are
a
puppet
-
show
and
a
mountebank
;
but
then
their
religion
affords
a
perpetual
comedy
.
<EOS>
Their
high
masses
,
their
feasts
,
their
processions
,
their
pilgrimages
,
confessions
,
images
,
tapers
,
robes
,
incense
,
benedictions
,
spectacles
,
representations
,
and
innumerable
ceremonies
,
which
revolve
almost
incessantly
,
furnish
a
variety
of
entertainment
from
one
end
of
the
year
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
If
superstition
implies
fear
,
never
was
a
word
more
misapplied
than
it
is
to
the
mummery
of
the
religion
of
Rome
.
<EOS>
The
people
are
so
far
from
being
impressed
with
awe
and
religious
terror
by
this
sort
of
machinery
,
that
it
amuses
their
imaginations
in
the
most
agreeable
manner
,
and
keeps
them
always
in
good
humour
.
<EOS>
A
Roman
catholic
longs
as
impatiently
for
the
festival
of
St
Suaire
,
or
St
Croix
,
or
St
Veronique
,
as
a
schoolboy
in
England
for
the
representation
of
punch
and
the
devil
;
and
there
is
generally
as
much
laughing
at
one
farce
as
at
the
other
.
<EOS>
Even
when
the
descent
from
the
cross
is
acted
,
in
the
holy
week
,
with
all
the
circumstances
that
ought
naturally
to
inspire
the
gravest
sentiments
,
if
you
cast
your
eyes
among
the
multitude
that
croud
the
place
,
you
will
not
discover
one
melancholy
face
:
all
is
prattling
,
tittering
,
or
laughing
;
and
ten
to
one
<EOS>
but
you
perceive
a
number
of
them
employed
in
hissing
the
female
who
personates
the
Virgin
Mary
.
<EOS>
And
here
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
observe
,
that
the
Roman
catholics
,
not
content
with
the
infinite
number
of
saints
who
really
existed
,
have
not
only
personified
the
cross
,
but
made
two
female
saints
out
of
a
piece
of
linen
.
<EOS>
Veronique
,
or
Veronica
,
is
no
other
than
a
corruption
of
vera
icon
,
or
vera
effigies
,
said
to
be
the
exact
representation
of
our
Saviour
's
face
,
impressed
upon
a
piece
of
linen
,
with
which
he
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
forehead
in
his
way
to
the
place
of
crucifixion
.
<EOS>
The
same
is
worshipped
under
the
name
of
St
Suaire
,
from
the
Latin
word
sudarium
.
<EOS>
This
same
handkerchief
is
said
to
have
had
three
folds
,
on
every
one
of
which
was
the
impression
:
one
of
these
remains
at
Jerusalem
,
a
second
was
brought
to
Rome
,
and
a
third
was
conveyed
to
Spain
.
<EOS>
Baronius
says
,
there
is
a
very
antient
history
of
the
sancta
facies
in
the
Vatican
.
<EOS>
Tillemont
,
however
,
looks
upon
the
whole
as
a
fable
.
<EOS>
Some
suppose
Veronica
to
be
the
same
with
St
Haemorrhoissa
,
the
patroness
of
those
who
are
afflicted
with
the
piles
,
who
make
their
joint
invocations
to
her
and
St
Fiacre
,
the
son
of
a
Scotch
king
,
who
lived
and
died
a
hermit
in
France
.
<EOS>
The
troops
of
Henry
V
of
England
are
said
to
have
pillaged
the
chapel
of
this
Highland
saint
;
who
,
in
revenge
,
assisted
his
countrymen
,
in
the
French
service
,
to
defeat
the
English
at
Bauge
,
and
afterwards
afflicted
Henry
with
the
piles
,
of
which
he
died
.
<EOS>
This
prince
complained
,
that
he
was
not
only
plagued
by
the
living
Scots
,
but
even
persecuted
by
those
who
were
dead
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
not
whether
I
may
be
allowed
to
compare
the
Romish
religion
to
comedy
,
and
Calvinism
to
tragedy
.
<EOS>
The
first
amuses
the
senses
,
and
excites
ideas
of
mirth
and
good
-
humour
;
the
other
,
like
tragedy
,
deals
in
the
passions
of
terror
and
pity
.
<EOS>
Step
into
a
conventicle
of
dissenters
,
you
will
,
ten
to
one
,
hear
the
minister
holding
forth
upon
the
sufferings
of
Christ
,
or
the
torments
of
hell
,
and
see
many
marks
of
religious
horror
in
the
faces
of
the
hearers
.
<EOS>
This
is
perhaps
one
reason
why
the
reformation
did
not
succeed
in
France
,
among
a
volatile
,
giddy
,
unthinking
people
,
shocked
at
the
mortified
appearances
of
the
Calvinists
;
and
accounts
for
its
rapid
progress
among
nations
of
a
more
melancholy
turn
of
character
and
complexion
:
for
,
in
the
conversion
of
the
multitude
,
reason
is
generally
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
Even
the
penance
imposed
upon
the
catholics
is
little
more
than
mock
mortification
:
a
murderer
is
often
quit
with
his
confessor
for
saying
three
prayers
extraordinary
;
and
these
easy
terms
,
on
which
absolution
is
obtained
,
certainly
encourage
the
repetition
of
the
most
enormous
crimes
.
<EOS>
The
pomp
and
ceremonies
of
this
religion
,
together
with
the
great
number
of
holidays
they
observe
,
howsoever
<EOS>
they
may
keep
up
the
spirits
of
the
commonalty
,
and
help
to
diminish
the
sense
of
their
own
misery
,
must
certainly
,
at
the
same
time
,
produce
a
frivolous
taste
for
frippery
and
shew
,
and
encourage
a
habit
of
idleness
,
to
which
I
,
in
a
great
measure
,
ascribe
the
extreme
poverty
of
the
lower
people
.
<EOS>
Very
near
half
of
their
time
,
which
might
he
profitably
employed
in
the
exercise
of
industry
,
is
lost
to
themselves
and
the
community
,
in
attendance
upon
the
different
exhibitions
of
religious
mummery
.
  
<EOS>
But
as
this
letter
has
already
run
to
an
unconscionable
length
,
I
shall
defer
,
till
another
occasion
,
what
I
have
further
to
say
on
the
people
of
this
place
,
and
in
the
mean
time
assure
you
,
that
I
am
always
 
Yours
affectionately

<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
<EOS>
My
stay
in
this
place
now
draws
towards
a
period
.
 
<EOS>
'
Till
within
these
few
days
I
have
continued
bathing
,
with
some
advantage
to
my
health
,
though
the
season
has
been
cold
and
wet
,
and
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
fine
prospect
of
a
plentiful
harvest
in
this
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
I
used
to
have
great
pleasure
in
driving
between
the
fields
of
wheat
,
oats
,
and
barley
;
but
the
crop
has
been
entirely
ruined
by
the
rain
,
and
nothing
is
now
to
be
seen
on
the
ground
but
the
tarnished
straw
,
and
the
rotten
spoils
of
the
husbandman
's
labour
.
<EOS>
The
ground
scarce
affords
subsistence
to
a
few
flocks
of
meagre
sheep
,
that
crop
the
stubble
,
and
the
intervening
grass
;
each
flock
under
the
protection
of
its
shepherd
,
with
his
crook
and
dogs
,
who
lies
every
night
in
the
midst
of
the
fold
,
in
a
little
thatched
travelling
lodge
,
mounted
on
a
wheel
-
carriage
.
<EOS>
Here
he
passes
the
night
,
in
order
to
defend
his
flock
from
the
wolves
,
which
are
sometimes
,
especially
in
winter
,
very
bold
and
desperate
.
  
<EOS>
Two
days
ago
we
made
an
excursion
with
Mrs
B
  
and
Capt
L
  
to
the
village
of
Samers
,
on
the
Paris
road
,
about
three
leagues
from
Boulogne
.
<EOS>
Here
is
a
venerable
abbey
of
Benedictines
,
well
endowed
,
with
large
agreeable
gardens
prettily
laid
out
.
<EOS>
The
monks
are
well
lodged
,
and
well
entertained
.
<EOS>
Tho
'
restricted
from
flesh
meals
by
the
rules
of
their
order
,
they
are
allowed
to
eat
wild
duck
and
teal
,
as
a
species
of
fish
;
and
when
they
long
for
a
good
bouillon
,
or
a
partridge
,
or
pullet
,
they
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
say
they
are
out
of
order
.
<EOS>
In
that
case
the
appetite
of
the
patient
is
indulged
in
his
own
apartment
.
<EOS>
Their
church
is
elegantly
contrived
,
but
kept
in
a
very
dirty
condition
.
<EOS>
The
greatest
curiosity
I
saw
in
this
place
was
an
English
boy
,
about
eight
or
nine
years
old
,
whom
his
father
had
sent
hither
to
learn
the
French
language
.
<EOS>
In
less
than
eight
weeks
,
he
was
become
captain
of
the
boys
of
the
place
,
spoke
French
perfectly
well
,
and
had
almost
forgot
his
mother
tongue
.
<EOS>
But
to
return
to
the
people
of
Boulogne
.
  
<EOS>
The
burghers
here
,
as
in
other
places
,
consist
of
merchants
,
shop
-
keepers
,
and
artisans
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
merchants
have
got
fortunes
,
by
fitting
out
privateers
during
the
war
.
<EOS>
A
great
many
single
ships
were
taken
from
the
English
,
notwithstanding
the
good
look
-
out
of
our
cruisers
,
who
were
so
alert
,
that
the
privateers
from
this
coast
were
often
taken
in
four
hours
after
they
sailed
from
the
French
harbour
;
and
there
is
hardly
a
captain
of
an
armateur
in
Boulogne
,
who
has
not
been
prisoner
in
England
five
or
six
times
in
the
course
of
the
war
.
<EOS>
They
were
fitted
out
at
a
very
small
expence
,
and
used
to
run
over
in
the
night
to
the
coast
of
England
,
where
they
hovered
as
English
fishing
smacks
,
until
they
kidnapped
some
coaster
,
with
which
they
made
the
best
of
their
way
across
the
Channel
.
<EOS>
If
they
fell
in
with
a
British
cruiser
,
they
surrendered
without
resistance
:
the
captain
was
soon
exchanged
,
and
the
loss
of
the
proprietor
was
not
great
:
if
they
brought
their
prize
safe
into
harbour
,
the
advantage
was
considerable
.
<EOS>
In
time
of
peace
the
merchants
of
Boulogne
deal
in
wine
brandies
,
and
oil
,
imported
from
the
South
,
and
export
fish
,
with
the
manufactures
of
France
,
to
Portugal
,
and
other
countries
;
but
the
trade
is
not
great
.
<EOS>
Here
are
two
or
three
considerable
houses
of
wine
merchants
from
Britain
,
who
deal
in
Bourdeaux
wine
,
with
which
they
supply
London
and
other
parts
of
England
,
Scotland
,
and
Ireland
.
<EOS>
The
fishery
of
mackarel
and
herring
is
so
considerable
on
this
coast
,
that
it
is
said
to
yield
annually
eight
or
nine
hundred
thousand
livres
,
about
thirty
-
five
thousand
pounds
sterling
.
  
<EOS>
The
shop
-
keepers
here
drive
a
considerable
traffic
with
the
English
smugglers
,
whose
cutters
are
almost
the
only
vessels
one
sees
in
the
harbour
of
Boulogne
,
if
we
except
about
a
dozen
of
those
flat
-
bottomed
boats
,
which
raised
such
alarms
in
England
,
in
the
course
of
the
war
.
<EOS>
Indeed
they
seem
to
be
good
for
nothing
else
,
and
perhaps
they
were
built
for
this
purpose
only
.
<EOS>
The
smugglers
from
the
coast
of
Kent
and
Sussex
pay
English
gold
for
great
quantities
of
French
brandy
,
tea
,
coffee
,
and
small
wine
,
which
they
run
from
this
country
.
<EOS>
They
likewise
buy
glass
trinkets
,
toys
,
and
coloured
prints
,
which
sell
in
England
,
for
no
other
reason
,
but
that
they
come
from
France
,
as
they
may
be
had
as
cheap
,
and
much
better
finished
,
of
our
own
manufacture
.
<EOS>
They
likewise
take
off
ribbons
,
laces
,
linen
,
and
cambrics
;
though
this
branch
of
trade
is
chiefly
in
the
hands
of
traders
that
come
from
London
and
make
their
purchases
at
Dunkirk
,
where
they
pay
no
duties
.
<EOS>
It
is
certainly
worth
while
for
any
traveller
to
lay
in
a
stock
of
linen
either
at
Dunkirk
or
Boulogne
;
the
difference
of
the
price
at
these
two
places
is
not
great
.
<EOS>
Even
here
I
have
made
a
provision
of
shirts
for
one
half
of
the
money
they
would
have
cost
in
London
.
<EOS>
Undoubtedly
the
practice
of
smuggling
is
very
detrimental
to
the
fair
trader
,
and
carries
considerable
sums
of
money
out
of
the
kingdom
,
to
enrich
our
rivals
and
enemies
.
<EOS>
The
custom
-
house
officers
are
very
watchful
,
and
make
a
great
number
of
seizures
:
nevertheless
,
the
smugglers
find
their
account
in
continuing
this
contraband
commerce
;
and
are
said
to
indemnify
themselves
,
if
they
save
one
cargo
out
of
three
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
the
best
way
to
prevent
smuggling
,
is
to
lower
the
duties
upon
the
commodities
which
are
thus
introduced
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
told
,
that
the
revenue
upon
tea
has
encreased
ever
since
the
duty
upon
it
was
diminished
.
<EOS>
By
the
bye
,
the
tea
smuggled
on
the
coast
of
Sussex
is
most
execrable
stuff
.
<EOS>
While
I
stayed
at
Hastings
,
for
the
conveniency
of
bathing
,
I
must
have
changed
my
breakfast
,
if
I
had
not
luckily
brought
tea
with
me
from
London
:
yet
we
have
as
good
tea
at
Boulogne
for
nine
livres
a
pound
,
as
that
which
sells
at
fourteen
shillings
at
London
.
  
<EOS>
The
bourgeois
of
this
place
seem
to
live
at
their
ease
,
probably
in
consequence
of
their
trade
with
the
English
.
<EOS>
Their
houses
consist
of
the
ground
-
floor
,
one
story
above
,
and
garrets
.
<EOS>
In
those
which
are
well
furnished
,
you
see
pier
-
glasses
and
marble
slabs
;
but
the
chairs
are
either
paultry
things
,
made
with
straw
bottoms
,
which
cost
about
a
shilling
a
-
piece
,
or
old
-
fashioned
,
high
-
backed
seats
of
needle
-
work
,
stuffed
,
very
clumsy
and
incommodious
.
<EOS>
The
tables
are
square
fir
boards
,
that
stand
on
edge
in
a
corner
,
except
when
they
are
used
,
and
then
they
are
set
upon
cross
legs
that
open
and
shut
occasionally
.
<EOS>
The
king
of
France
dines
off
a
board
of
this
kind

<EOS>
Here
is
plenty
of
table
-
linen
however
.
<EOS>
The
poorest
tradesman
in
Boulogne
has
a
napkin
on
every
cover
,
and
silver
forks
with
four
prongs
,
which
are
used
with
the
right
hand
,
there
being
very
little
occasion
for
knives
;
for
the
meat
is
boiled
or
roasted
to
rags
.
<EOS>
The
French
beds
are
so
high
,
that
sometimes
one
is
obliged
to
mount
them
by
the
help
of
steps
;
and
this
is
also
the
case
in
Flanders
.
<EOS>
They
very
seldom
use
feather
-
beds
;
but
they
lie
upon
a
paillasse
,
or
bag
of
straw
,
over
which
are
laid
two
,
and
sometimes
three
mattrasses
.
<EOS>
Their
testers
are
high
and
old
-
fashioned
,
and
their
curtains
generally
of
thin
bays
,
red
,
or
green
,
laced
with
taudry
yellow
,
in
imitation
of
gold
.
<EOS>
In
some
houses
,
however
,
one
meets
with
furniture
of
stamped
linen
;
but
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
carpet
to
be
seen
,
and
the
floors
are
in
a
very
dirty
condition
.
<EOS>
They
have
not
even
the
implements
of
cleanliness
in
this
country
.
<EOS>
Every
chamber
is
furnished
with
an
armoire
,
or
clothes
-
press
,
and
a
chest
of
drawers
,
of
very
clumsy
workmanship
.
<EOS>
Every
thing
shews
a
deficiency
in
the
mechanic
arts
.
<EOS>
There
is
not
a
door
,
nor
a
window
,
that
shuts
close
.
<EOS>
The
hinges
,
locks
,
and
latches
,
are
of
iron
,
coarsely
made
,
and
ill
contrived
.
<EOS>
The
very
chimnies
are
built
so
open
,
that
they
admit
both
rain
and
sun
,
and
all
of
them
smoke
intolerably
.
<EOS>
If
there
is
no
cleanliness
among
these
people
,
much
less
shall
we
find
delicacy
,
which
is
the
cleanliness
of
the
mind
.
<EOS>
Indeed
they
are
utter
strangers
to
what
we
call
common
decency
;
and
I
could
give
you
some
high
-
flavoured
instances
,
at
which
even
a
native
of
Edinburgh
would
stop
his
nose
.
<EOS>
There
are
certain
mortifying
views
of
human
nature
,
which
undoubtedly
ought
to
be
concealed
as
much
as
possible
,
in
order
to
prevent
giving
offence
:
and
nothing
can
be
more
absurd
,
than
to
plead
the
difference
of
custom
in
different
countries
,
in
defence
of
these
usages
which
can
not
fail
giving
disgust
to
the
organs
and
senses
of
all
mankind
.
<EOS>
Will
custom
exempt
from
the
imputation
of
gross
indecency
a
French
lady
,
who
shifts
her
frowsy
smock
in
presence
of
a
male
visitant
,
and
talks
to
him
of
her
lavement

her
medecine

But
I
should
be
glad
to
know
,
whether
it
is
possible
for
a
fine
lady
to
speak

act
in
this
manner

without
exciting
ideas
to
her

There
is
nothing

vile

you
may
plead
prescription

the

Good

piss
upon
those
whom
they
delight
to
honour

A
true
-
bred
Frenchman
dips
his
fingers
,
imbrowned
with
snuff
,
into
his
plate
filled
with
ragout

between
every
three
mouthfuls
<EOS>
,
he
produces
his
snuff
-
box
,
and
takes
a
fresh
pinch
,
with
the
most
graceful
gesticulations
;
then
he
displays
his
handkerchief
,
which
may
be
termed
the
flag
of
abomination
,
and
,
in
the
use
of
both
,
scatters
his
favours
among
those
who
have
the
happiness
to
sit
near
him
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
owned
,
however
,
that
a
Frenchman
will
not
drink
out
of
a
tankard
,
in
which
,
perhaps
,
a
dozen
of
filthy
mouths
have
flabbered
,
as
is
the
custom
in
England
.
<EOS>
Here
every
individual
has
his
own
gobelet

which
stands
before
him

and
he
helps
himself
occasionally
with
wine
or
water
,
or
both
,
which
likewise
stand
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
But
I
know
no
custom
more
beastly
than
that
of
using
water
-
glasses
,
in
which
polite
company
spirt

squirt

<EOS>
I
do
n't
doubt
<EOS>
but
I
shall
live
to
see
the
day
<EOS>
,
when
the
hospitable
custom
of
the
antient
Aegyptians
will
be
revived
;
then
a
conveniency
will
be
placed
behind
every
chair
in
company
,
with
a
proper
provision
of
waste
paper
,
that
individuals
may
make
themselves
easy
without
parting
company
.
<EOS>
I
insist
upon
it
,
that
this
practice
would
not
be
more
indelicate
than
that
which
is
now
in
use
.

What
then

you
will

must
a

sit

No

let
those
who
can
not
eat
without
defiling
themselves
,
step
into
another
room
,
provided
with
basons
and
towels

but
I
think
it
would
be
better
to
institute
schools
,
where
youth
may
learn
to
eat
their
victuals

without
daubing
themselves

or
giving
offence

supper

at
all
their

there
is
a
dessert

This
indeed
is
the
practice
all
over

they
eat

fricassees

The

The
most
extraordinary
circumstance
that
I
observed
on
this
occasion
 
as
,
that
all
the
French
who
were
present
ate
of
every
dish
that
appeared

I
am
told

that
if
there

been

hundred
articles
more

He
had
been
garde
du
corps
,
or
life
-
guardman
at
Versailles
;
and
by
virtue
of
this
office
he
was
perfectly
well
acquainted
with
the
persons
of
the
king
and
the
dauphin
,
with
the
characters
of
the
ministers
and
grandees
,
and
,
in
a
word
,
with
all
the
secrets
of
state
,
on
which
he
held
forth
with
equal
solemnity
and
elocution
.
<EOS>
He
exclaimed
against
the
jesuits
,
and
the
farmers
of
the
revenue
,
who
,
he
said
,
had
ruined
France
.
<EOS>
Then
,
addressing
himself
to
me
,
asked
,
if
the
English
did
not
every
day
drink
to
the
health
of
madame
<EOS>
la
marquise
?
<EOS>
I
did
not
at
first
comprehend
his
meaning
;
but
answered
in
general
,
that
the
English
were
not
deficient
in
complaisance
for
the
ladies
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
(
cried
he
)
<EOS>
she
is
the
best
friend
they
have
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
If
it
had
not
been
for
her
,
they
would
not
have
such
reason
to
boast
of
the
advantages
of
the
war
.
<EOS>
"
I
told
him
the
only
conquest
which
the
French
had
made
in
the
war
,
was
atchieved
by
one
of
her
generals
:
I
meant
the
taking
of
Mahon
.
<EOS>
But
I
did
not
choose
to
prosecute
the
discourse
,
remembering
that
in
the
year
1749
,
I
had
like
to
have
had
an
affair
with
a
Frenchman
at
Ghent
,
who
affirmed
,
that
all
the
battles
gained
by
the
great
duke
of
Marlborough
were
purposely
lost
by
the
French
generals
,
in
order
to
bring
the
schemes
of
madame
de
Maintenon
into
disgrace
.
<EOS>
This
is
no
bad
resource
for
the
national
vanity
of
these
people
:
though
,
in
general
,
they
are
really
persuaded
,
that
theirs
is
the
richest
,
the
bravest
,
the
happiest
,
and
the
most
powerful
nation
under
the
sun
;
and
therefore
,
without
some
such
cause
,
they
must
be
invincible
.
<EOS>
By
the
bye
,
the
common
people
here
still
frighten
their
wayward
children
with
the
name
of
Marlborough
.
<EOS>
Mr
B
 
's
son
,
who
was
nursed
at
a
peasant
's
house
,
happening
one
day
,
after
he
was
brought
home
,
to
be
in
disgrace
with
his
father
,
who
threatened
to
correct
him
,
the
child
ran
for
protection
to
his
mother
,
crying
,
"
Faites
sortir
ce
vilaine
Malbroug
,
<EOS>
"
"
Turn
out
that
rogue
Marlborough
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
amazing
to
hear
a
sensible
Frenchman
assert
,
that
the
revenues
of
France
amount
to
four
hundred
millions
of
livres
,
about
twenty
millions
sterling
,
clear
of
all
incumbrances
,
when
in
fact
their
clear
revenue
is
not
much
above
ten
.
<EOS>
Without
all
doubt
they
have
reason
to
inveigh
against
the
fermiers
generaux
,
who
oppress
the
people
in
raising
the
taxes
,
not
above
two
-
thirds
of
which
are
brought
into
the
king
's
coffers
:
the
rest
enriches
themselves
,
and
enables
them
to
bribe
high
for
the
protection
of
the
great
,
which
is
the
only
support
they
have
against
the
remonstrances
of
the
states
and
parliaments
,
and
the
suggestions
of
common
sense
;
which
will
ever
demonstrate
this
to
be
,
of
all
others
,
the
most
pernicious
method
of
supplying
the
necessities
of
government
.
  
<EOS>
Mons

<EOS>
L
 
y
seasoned
the
severity
of
his
political
apothegms
with
intermediate
sallies
of
mirth
and
gallantry
.
<EOS>
He
ogled
the
venerable
gentlewoman
his
commere
,
who
sat
by
him
.
<EOS>
He
looked
,
sighed
,
and
languished
,
sung
tender
songs
,
and
kissed
the
old
lady
's
hand
with
all
the
ardour
of
a
youthful
admirer
.
<EOS>
I
unfortunately
congratulated
him
on
having
such
a
pretty
young
gentleman
to
his
son
.
<EOS>
He
answered
,
sighing
,
that
the
boy
had
talents
,
but
did
not
put
them
to
a
proper
use
 
<EOS>
"
Long
before
I
attained
his
age
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
I
had
finished
my
rhetoric
.
"
<EOS>
Captain
B
 
,
who
had
eaten
himself
black
in
the
face
,
and
,
with
the
napkin
under
his
chin
,
was
no
bad
representation
of
Sancho
Panza
in
the
suds
,
with
the
dishclout
about
his
neck
,
when
the
duke
's
scullions
insisted
upon
shaving
him
;
this
sea
-
wit
,
turning
to
the
boy
,
with
a
waggish
leer
,
"
I
suppose
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
you
do
n't
understand
the
figure
of
amplification
so
well
as
Monsieur
your
father
.
<EOS>
"
At
that
instant
,
one
of
the
nieces
,
who
knew
her
uncle
to
be
very
ticklish
,
touched
him
under
the
short
ribs
,
on
which
the
little
man
attempted
to
spring
up
,
but
lost
the
centre
of
gravity
.
<EOS>
He
overturned
his
own
plate
in
the
lap
of
the
person
that
sat
next
to
him
,
and
falling
obliquely
upon
his
own
chair
,
both
tumbled
down
upon
the
floor
together
,
to
the
great
discomposure
of
the
whole
company
;
for
the
poor
man
would
have
been
actually
strangled
,
had
not
his
nephew
loosed
his
stock
with
great
expedition
.
<EOS>
Matters
being
once
more
adjusted
,
and
the
captain
condoled
on
his
disaster
,
Mons
.
<EOS>
L
 
y
took
it
in
his
head
to
read
his
son
a
lecture
upon
filial
obedience
.
<EOS>
This
was
mingled
with
some
sharp
reproof
,
which
the
boy
took
so
ill
that
he
retired
.
<EOS>
The
old
lady
observed
that
he
had
been
too
severe
:
her
daughter
-
in
-
law
,
who
was
very
pretty
,
said
her
brother
had
given
him
too
much
reason
;
hinting
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
he
was
addicted
to
some
terrible
vices
;
upon
which
several
individuals
repeated
the
interjection
,
ah
!
ah
!
"
<EOS>
Yes
(
said
Mons
.
<EOS>
L
 
y
,
with
a
rueful
aspect
)
<EOS>
the
boy
has
a
pernicious
turn
for
gaming
:
in
one
afternoon
he
lost
,
at
billiards
,
such
a
sum
as
gives
me
horror
to
think
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
Fifty
sols
in
one
afternoon
,
"
(
cried
the
sister
)
.
"
<EOS>
Fifty
sols
!
<EOS>
(
exclaimed
the
mother
-
in
-
law
,
with
marks
of
astonishment
)
<EOS>
that
's
too
much
 
<EOS>
that
's
too
much
!
 
<EOS>
he
's
to
blame
  
<EOS>
he
's
to

<EOS>
but

<EOS>
L

ah

<EOS>

la

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
et
l'amour

"
cried
the
father
,
wiping
his
eyes
,
squeezing
her
hand
,
and
looking
tenderly
upon
her
.
<EOS>
Mr
B
  
took
this
opportunity
to
bring
in
the
young
gentleman
,
who
was
admitted
into
favour
,
and
received
a
second
exhortation
.
<EOS>
Thus
harmony
was
restored
,
and
the
entertainment
concluded
with
fruit
,
coffee
,
and
liqueurs
.
  
<EOS>
When
a
bourgeois
of
Boulogne
takes
the
air
,
he
goes
in
a
one
-
horse
chaise
,
which
is
here
called
cabriolet
,
and
hires
it
for
half
-
a
-
crown
a
day
.
<EOS>
There
are
also
travelling
chaises
,
which
hold
four
persons
,
two
seated
with
their
faces
to
the
horses
,
and
two
behind
their
backs
;
but
those
vehicles
are
all
very
ill
made
,
and
extremely
inconvenient
.
<EOS>
The
way
of
riding
most
used
in
this
place
is
on
assback
.
<EOS>
You
will
see
every
day
,
in
the
skirts
of
the
town
,
a
great
number
of
females
thus
mounted
,
with
the
feet
on
either
side
occasionally
,
according
as
the
wind
blows
,
so
that
sometimes
the
right
and
sometimes
the
left
hand
guides
the
beast
:
but
in
other
parts
of
France
,
as
well
as
in
Italy
,
the
ladies
sit
on
horseback
with
their
legs
astride
,
and
are
provided
with
drawers
for
that
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
said
the
French
people
were
kept
in
good
humour
by
the
fopperies
of
their
religion
,
I
did
not
mean
that
there
were
no
gloomy
spirits
among
them
.
<EOS>
There
will
be
fanatics
in
religion
,
while
there
are
people
of
a
saturnine
disposition
,
and
melancholy
turn
of
mind
.
<EOS>
The
character
of
a
devotee
,
which
is
hardly
known
in
England
,
is
very
common
here
.
<EOS>
You
see
them
walking
to
and
from
church
at
all
hours
,
in
their
hoods
and
long
camblet
cloaks
,
with
a
slow
pace
,
demure
aspect
,
and
downcast
eye
.
<EOS>
Those
who
are
poor
become
very
troublesome
to
the
monks
,
with
their
scruples
and
cases
of
conscience
:
you
may
see
them
on
their
knees
,
at
the
confessional
,
every
hour
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
The
rich
devotee
has
her
favourite
confessor
,
whom
she
consults
and
regales
in
private
,
at
her
own
house
;
and
this
spiritual
director
generally
governs
the
whole
family
.
<EOS>
For
my
part
I
never
knew
a
fanatic
that
was
not
an
hypocrite
at
bottom
.
<EOS>
Their
pretensions
to
superior
sanctity
,
and
an
absolute
conquest
over
all
the
passions
,
which
human
reason
was
never
yet
able
to
subdue
,
introduce
a
habit
of
dissimulation
,
which
,
like
all
other
habits
,
is
confirmed
by
use
,
till
at
length
they
become
adepts
in
the
art
and
science
of
hypocrisy
.
<EOS>
Enthusiasm
and
hypocrisy
are
by
no
means
incompatible
.
<EOS>
The
wildest
fanatics
I
ever
knew
,
were
real
sensualists
in
their
way
of
living
,
and
cunning
cheats
in
their
dealings
with
mankind
.
  
<EOS>
Among
the
lower
class
of
people
at
Boulogne
,
those
who
take
the
lead
,
are
the
sea
-
faring
men
,
who
live
in
one
quarter
,
divided
into
classes
,
and
registered
for
the
service
of
the
king
.
<EOS>
They
are
hardy
and
raw
-
boned
,
exercise
the
trade
of
fishermen
and
boatmen
,
and
propagate
like
rabbits
.
<EOS>
They
have
put
themselves
under
the
protection
of
a
miraculous
image
of
the
Virgin
Mary
,
which
is
kept
in
one
of
their
churches
,
and
every
year
carried
in
procession
.
<EOS>
According
to
the
legend
,
this
image
was
carried
off
,
with
other
pillage
,
by
the
English
,
when
they
took
Boulogne
,
in
the
reign
of
Henry
VIII
.
<EOS>
The
lady
,
rather
than
reside
in
England
,
where
she
found
a
great
many
heretics
,
trusted
herself
alone
in
an
open
boat
,
and
crossed
the
sea
to
the
road
of
Boulogne
,
where
she
was
seen
waiting
for
a
pilot
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
a
boat
put
off
to
her
assistance
,
and
brought
her
safe
into
the
harbour
:
since
which
time
she
has
continued
to
patronize
the
watermen
of
Boulogne
.
<EOS>
At
present
she
is
very
black
and
very
ugly
,
besides
being
cruelly
mutilated
in
different
parts
of
her
body
,
which
I
suppose
have
been
amputated
,
and
converted
into
tobacco
-
stoppers
;
but
once
a
year
she
is
dressed
in
very
rich
attire
,
and
carried
in
procession
,
with
a
silver
boat
,
provided
at
the
expence
of
the
sailors
.
<EOS>
That
vanity
which
characterises
the
French
extends
even
to
the
canaille
.
<EOS>
The
lowest
creature
among
them
is
sure
to
have
her
ear
-
rings
and
golden
cross
hanging
about
her
neck
.
<EOS>
Indeed
this
last
is
an
implement
of
superstition
as
well
as
of
dress
,
without
which
no
female
appears
.
<EOS>
The
common
people
here
,
as
in
all
countries
where
they
live
poorly
and
dirtily
,
are
hard
-
featured
,
and
of
very
brown
,
or
rather
tawny
complexions
.
<EOS>
As
they
seldom
eat
meat
,
their
juices
are
destitute
of
that
animal
oil
which
gives
a
plumpness
and
smoothness
to
the
skin
,
and
defends
those
fine
capillaries
from
the
injuries
of
the
weather
,
which
would
otherwise
coalesce
,
or
be
shrunk
up
,
so
as
to
impede
the
circulation
on
the
external
surface
of
the
body
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
dirt
,
it
undoubtedly
blocks
up
the
pores
of
the
skin
,
and
disorders
the
perspiration
;
consequently
must
contribute
to
the
scurvy
,
itch
,
and
other
cutaneous
distempers
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
quarter
of
the
matelots
at
Boulogne
,
there
is
a
number
of
poor
Canadians
,
who
were
removed
from
the
island
of
St
John
,
in
the
gulph
of
St
Laurence
,
when
it
was
reduced
by
the
English
.
<EOS>
These
people
are
maintained
at
the
expence
of
the
king
,
who
allows
them
soldier
's
pay
,
that
is
five
sols
,
or
two
-
pence
halfpenny
a
day
;
or
rather
three
sols
and
ammunition
bread
.
<EOS>
How
the
soldiers
contrive
to
subsist
upon
this
wretched
allowance
,
I
can
not
comprehend
:
<EOS>
but
,
it
must
be
owned
,
<EOS>
that
those
invalids
who
do
duty
at
Boulogne
betray
no
marks
of
want
.
<EOS>
They
are
hale
and
stout
,
neatly
and
decently
cloathed
,
and
on
the
whole
look
better
than
the
pensioners
of
Chelsea
.
  
<EOS>
About
three
weeks
ago
I
was
favoured
with
a
visit
by
one
<EOS>
Mr
M
 
,
an
English
gentleman
,
who
seems
far
gone
in
a
consumption
.
<EOS>
He
passed
the
last
winter
at
Nismes
in
Languedoc
,
and
found
himself
much
better
in
the
beginning
of
summer
,
when
he
embarked
at
Cette
,
and
returned
by
sea
to
England
.
<EOS>
He
soon
relapsed
,
however
,
and
(
as
he
imagines
)
in
consequence
of
a
cold
caught
at
sea
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
,
his
intention
was
to
try
the
South
again
,
and
even
to
go
as
far
as
Italy
.
<EOS>
I
advised
him
to
make
trial
of
the
air
of
Nice
,
where
I
myself
proposed
to
reside
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
relish
my
advice
,
and
proceeded
towards
Paris
in
his
own
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
to
-
morrow
ship
<EOS>
my
great
chests
on
board
of
a
ship
bound
to
Bourdeaux
;
they
are
directed
,
and
recommended
to
the
care
of
a
merchant
of
that
place
,
who
will
forward
them
by
Thoulouse
,
and
the
canal
of
Languedoc
,
to
his
correspondent
at
Cette
,
which
is
the
sea
-
port
of
Montpellier
.
<EOS>
The
charge
of
their
conveyance
to
Bourdeaux
does
not
exceed
one
guinea
.
<EOS>
They
consist
of
two
very
large
chests
and
a
trunk
,
about
a
thousand
pounds
weight
;
and
the
expence
of
transporting
them
from
Bourdeaux
to
Cette
,
will
not
exceed
thirty
livres
.
<EOS>
They
are
already
sealed
with
lead
at
the
customhouse
,
that
they
may
be
exempted
from
further
visitation
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
precaution
which
every
traveller
takes
,
both
by
sea
and
land
:
he
must
likewise
provide
himself
with
a
passe
-
avant
at
the
bureau
,
otherwise
he
may
be
stopped
,
and
rummaged
at
every
town
through
which
he
passes
.
<EOS>
I
have
hired
a
berline
and
four
horses
to
Paris
,
for
fourteen
loui'dores
;
two
of
which
the
voiturier
is
obliged
to
pay
for
a
permission
from
the
farmers
of
the
poste
;
for
every
thing
is
farmed
in
this
country
;
and
if
you
hire
a
carriage
,
as
I
have
done
,
you
must
pay
twelve
livres
,
or
half
-
a
-
guinea
,
for
every
person
that
travels
in
it
.
<EOS>
The
common
coach
between
Calais
and
Paris
,
is
such
a
vehicle
as
no
man
would
use
,
who
has
any
regard
to
his
own
case
and
convenience
and
it
travels
at
the
pace
of
an
English
waggon
.
  
<EOS>
In
ten
days
I
shall
set
out
on
my
journey
;
and
I
shall
leave
Boulogne
with
regret
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
happy
in
the
acquaintance
of
Mrs
B
 
,
and
a
few
British
families
in
the
place
;
and
it
was
my
good
fortune
to
meet
here
with
two
honest
gentlemen
,
whom
I
had
formerly
known
in
Paris
,
as
well
as
with
some
of
my
countrymen
,
officers
in
the
service
of
France
.
<EOS>
My
next
will
be
from
Paris
.
<EOS>
Remember
me
to
our
friends
at
A
 
'
s.
<EOS>
I
am
a
little
heavy
-
hearted
at
the
prospect
of
removing
to
such
a
distance
from
you
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
moot
point
whether
I
shall
ever
return
.
<EOS>
My
health
is
very
precarious
.

Adieu

<EOS>
PARIS
,
October
12
,
1763
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
Of
our
journey
from
Boulogne
<EOS>
I
have
little
to
say
.
<EOS>
The
weather
was
favourable
,
and
the
roads
were
in
tolerable
order
.
<EOS>
We
found
good
accommodation
at
Montreuil
and
Amiens
;
but
in
every
other
place
where
we
stopped
,
we
met
with
abundance
of
dirt
,
and
the
most
flagrant
imposition
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
pretend
to
describe
the
cities
of
Abbeville
and
Amiens
,
which
we
saw
only
en
passant
;
nor
take
up
your
time
with
an
account
of
the
stables
and
palace
of
Chantilly
,
belonging
to
the
prince
of
Conde
,
which
we
visited
the
last
day
of
our
journey
;
nor
shall
I
detain
you
with
a
detail
of
the
Trefors
de
St
Denis
,
which
,
together
with
the
tombs
in
the
abbey
church
,
afforded
us
some
amusement
while
our
dinner
was
getting
ready
.
<EOS>
All
these
particulars
are
mentioned
in
twenty
different
books
of
tours
,
travels
,
and
directions
,
which
you
have
often
perused
.
<EOS>
I
shall
only
observe
,
that
the
abbey
church
is
the
lightest
piece
of
Gothic
architecture
I
have
seen
,
and
the
air
within
seems
perfectly
free
from
that
damp
and
moisture
,
so
perceivable
in
all
our
old
cathedrals
.
<EOS>
This
must
be
owing
to
the
nature
of
its
situation
.
<EOS>
There
are
some
fine
marble
statues
that
adorn
the
tombs
of
certain
individuals
here
interred
;
but
they
are
mostly
in
the
French
taste
,
which
is
quite
contrary
to
the
simplicity
of
the
antients
.
<EOS>
Their
attitudes
are
affected
,
unnatural
,
and
desultory
;
and
their
draperies
fantastic
;
or
,
as
one
of
our
English
artists
expressed
himself
,
they
are
all
of
a
flutter
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
treasures
,
which
are
shewn
on
certain
days
to
the
populace
gratis
,
they
are
contained
in
a
number
of
presses
,
or
armoires
,
and
,
if
the
stones
are
genuine
,
they
must
be
inestimable
:
but
this
I
can
not
believe
.
<EOS>
Indeed
I
have
been
told
,
that
what
they
shew
as
diamonds
are
no
more
than
composition
:
nevertheless
,
exclusive
of
these
,
there
are
some
rough
stones
of
great
value
,
and
many
curiosities
worth
seeing
.
<EOS>
The
monk
that
shewed
them
was
the
very
image
of
our
friend
Hamilton
,
both
in
his
looks
and
manner
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
one
thing
very
extraordinary
to
observe
of
the
French
auberges
,
which
seems
to
be
a
remarkable
deviation
from
the
general
character
of
the
nation
.
<EOS>
The
landlords
,
hostesses
,
and
servants
of
the
inns
upon
the
road
,
have
not
the
least
dash
of
complaisance
in
their
behaviour
to
strangers
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
coming
to
the
door
,
to
receive
you
as
in
England
,
they
take
no
manner
of
notice
of
you
;
but
leave
you
to
find
or
enquire
your
way
into
the
kitchen
,
and
there
you
must
ask
several
times
for
a
chamber
,
before
they
seem
willing
to
conduct
you
up
stairs
.
<EOS>
In
general
,
you
are
served
with
the
appearance
of
the
most
mortifying
indifference
,
at
the
very
time
they
are
laying
schemes
for
fleecing
you
of
your
money
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
very
odd
contrast
between
France
and
England
;
in
the
former
all
the
people
are
complaisant
but
the
publicans
;
in
the
latter
there
is
hardly
any
complaisance
but
among
the
publicans
.
<EOS>
When
I
said
all
the
people
in
France
,
I
ought
also
to
except
those
vermin
who
examine
the
baggage
of
travellers
in
different
parts
of
the
kingdom
.
<EOS>
Although
our
portmanteaus
were
sealed
with
lead
,
and
we
were
provided
with
a
passe
-
avant
from
the
douane
,
our
coach
was
searched
at
the
gate
of
Paris
by
which
we
entered
;
and
the
women
were
obliged
to
get
out
,
and
stand
in
the
open
street
,
till
this
operation
was
performed
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
desired
a
friend
to
provide
lodgings
for
me
at
Paris
,
in
the
Fauxbourg
St
Germain
;
and
accordingly
we
found
ourselves
accommodated
at
the
Hotel
de
Montmorency
,
with
a
first
floor
,
which
costs
me
ten
livres
a
day
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
put
up
with
it
<EOS>
had
it
been
less
polite
;
but
as
I
have
only
a
few
days
to
stay
in
this
place
,
and
some
visits
to
receive
,
I
am
not
sorry
that
my
friend
has
exceeded
his
commission
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
guilty
of
another
piece
of
extravagance
in
hiring
a
carosse
de
remise
,
for
which
I
pay
twelve
livres
a
day
.
<EOS>
Besides
the
article
of
visiting
,
I
could
not
leave
Paris
,
without
carrying
my
wife
and
the
girls
to
see
the
most
remarkable
places
in
and
about
this
capital
,
such
as
the
Luxemburg
,
the
Palais
-
Royal
,
the
Thuilleries
,
the
Louvre
,
the
Invalids
,
the
Gobelins
,
&
c.
together
with
Versailles
,
Trianon
,
Marli
,
Meudon
,
and
Choissi
;
and
therefore
,
I
thought
the
difference
in
point
of
expence
would
not
be
great
,
between
a
carosse
de
remise
and
a
hackney
coach
.
<EOS>
The
first
are
extremely
elegant
,
if
not
too
much
ornamented
,
the
last
are
very
shabby
and
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
Nothing
gives
me
such
chagrin
,
as
the
necessity
I
am
under
to
hire
a
valet
de
place
,
as
my
own
servant
does
not
speak
the
language
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
conceive
with
what
eagerness
and
dexterity
<EOS>
those
rascally
valets
exert
themselves
in
pillaging
strangers
.
<EOS>
There
is
always
one
ready
in
waiting
on
your
arrival
,
who
begins
by
assisting
your
own
servant
to
unload
your
baggage
,
and
interests
himself
in
your
affairs
with
such
artful
officiousness
,
that
you
will
find
it
difficult
to
shake
him
off
,
even
though
you
are
determined
beforehand
against
hiring
any
such
domestic
.
<EOS>
He
produces
recommendations
from
his
former
masters
,
and
the
people
of
the
house
vouch
for
his
honesty
.
  
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
those
fellows
are
very
handy
,
useful
,
and
obliging
;
and
so
far
honest
,
that
they
will
not
steal
in
the
usual
way
.
<EOS>
You
may
safely
trust
one
of
them
to
bring
you
a
hundred
loui'dores
from
your
banker
;
but
they
fleece
you
without
mercy
in
every
other
article
of
expence
.
<EOS>
They
lay
all
your
tradesmen
under
contribution
;
your
taylor
,
barber
,
mantua
-
maker
,
milliner
,
perfumer
,
shoe
-
maker
,
mercer
,
jeweller
,
hatter
,
traiteur
,
and
wine
-
merchant
:
even
the
bourgeois
who
owns
your
coach
pays
him
twenty
sols
per
day
.
<EOS>
His
wages
amount
to
twice
as
much
,
so
that
I
imagine
the
fellow
that
serves
me
,
makes
above
ten
shillings
a
day
,
besides
his
victuals
,
which
,
by
the
bye
,
he
has
no
right
to
demand
.
<EOS>
Living
at
Paris
,
to
the
best
of
my
recollection
,
is
very
near
twice
as
dear
as
it
was
fifteen
years
ago
;
and
,
indeed
,
this
is
the
case
in
London
;
a
circumstance
that
must
be
undoubtedly
owing
to
an
increase
of
taxes
;
for
I
do
n't
find
that
in
the
articles
of
eating
and
drinking
,
the
French
people
are
more
luxurious
than
they
were
heretofore
.
<EOS>
I
am
told
the
entrees
,
or
duties
,
payed
upon
provision
imported
into
Paris
,
are
very
heavy
.
<EOS>
All
manner
of
butcher
's
meat
and
poultry
are
extremely
good
in
this
place
.
<EOS>
The
beef
is
excellent
.
<EOS>
The
wine
,
which
is
generally
drank
,
is
a
very
thin
kind
of
Burgundy
.
<EOS>
I
can
by
no
means
relish
their
cookery
;
but
one
breakfasts
deliciously
upon
their
petit
pains
and
their
pales
of
butter
,
which
last
is
exquisite
.
  
<EOS>
The
common
people
,
and
even
the
bourgeois
of
Paris
live
,
at
this
season
,
chiefly
on
bread
and
grapes
,
which
is
undoubtedly
very
wholsome
fare
.
<EOS>
If
the
same
simplicity
of
diet
prevailed
in
England
,
we
should
certainly
undersell
the
French
at
all
foreign
markets
for
they
are
very
slothful
with
all
their
vivacity
and
the
great
number
of
their
holidays
not
only
encourages
this
lazy
disposition
,
but
actually
robs
them
of
one
half
of
what
their
labour
would
otherwise
produce
;
so
that
,
if
our
common
people
were
not
so
expensive
in
their
living
,
that
is
,
in
their
eating
and
drinking
,
labour
might
be
afforded
cheaper
in
England
than
in
France
.
<EOS>
There
are
three
young
lusty
hussies
,
nieces
or
daughters
of
a
blacksmith
,
that
lives
just
opposite
to
my
windows
,
who
do
nothing
from
morning
till
night
.
<EOS>
They
eat
grapes
and
bread
from
seven
till
nine
,
from
nine
till
twelve
they
dress
their
hair
,
and
are
all
the
afternoon
gaping
at
the
window
to
view
passengers
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
perceive
that
they
give
themselves
the
trouble
either
to
make
their
beds
,
or
clean
their
apartment
.
<EOS>
The
same
spirit
of
idleness
and
dissipation
I
have
observed
in
every
part
of
France
,
and
among
every
class
of
people
.
  
<EOS>
Every
object
seems
to
have
shrunk
in
its
dimensions
since
I
was
last
in
Paris
.
<EOS>
The
Louvre
,
the
Palais
-
Royal
,
the
bridges
,
and
the
river
Seine
,
by
no
means
answer
the
ideas
I
had
formed
of
them
from
my
former
observation
.
<EOS>
When
the
memory
is
not
very
correct
,
the
imagination
always
betrays
her
into
such
extravagances
.
<EOS>
When
I
first
revisited
my
own
country
,
after
an
absence
of
fifteen
years
,
I
found
every
thing
diminished
in
the
same
manner
,
and
I
could
scarce
believe
my
own
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
gay
disposition
of
the
French
,
their
houses
are
all
gloomy
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
all
the
ornaments
that
have
been
lavished
on
Versailles
,
it
is
a
dismal
habitation
.
<EOS>
The
apartments
are
dark
,
ill
-
furnished
,
dirty
,
and
unprincely
.
<EOS>
Take
the
castle
,
chapel
,
and
garden
all
together
,
they
make
a
most
fantastic
composition
of
magnificence
and
littleness
,
taste
,
and
foppery
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
it
is
in
England
only
,
where
we
must
look
for
cheerful
apartments
,
gay
furniture
,
neatness
,
and
convenience
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
strange
incongruity
in
the
French
genius
.
<EOS>
With
all
their
volatility
,
prattle
,
and
fondness
for
bons
mots
,
they
delight
in
a
species
of
drawling
,
melancholy
,
church
music
.
<EOS>
Their
most
favourite
dramatic
pieces
are
almost
without
incident
;
and
the
dialogue
of
their
comedies
consists
of
moral
,
insipid
apophthegms
,
intirely
destitute
of
wit
or
repartee
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
I
hazard
by
this
opinion
among
the
implicit
admirers
of
Lully
,
Racine
,
and
Moliere
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
n't
talk
of
the
busts
,
the
statues
,
and
pictures
which
abound
at
Versailles
,
and
other
places
in
and
about
Paris
,
particularly
the
great
collection
of
capital
pieces
in
the
Palais
-
royal
,
belonging
to
the
duke
of
Orleans
.
<EOS>
I
have
neither
capacity
,
nor
inclination
,
to
give
a
critique
on
these
chef
d'oeuvres
,
which
indeed
would
take
up
a
whole
volume
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
this
great
magazine
of
painting
three
times
,
with
astonishment
;
but
I
should
have
been
better
pleased
,
if
there
had
not
been
half
the
number
:
one
is
bewildered
in
such
a
profusion
,
as
not
to
know
where
to
begin
,
and
hurried
away
before
there
is
time
to
consider
one
piece
with
any
sort
of
deliberation
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
the
rooms
are
all
dark
,
and
a
great
many
of
the
pictures
hang
in
a
bad
light
.
<EOS>
As
for
Trianon
,
Marli
,
and
Choissi
,
they
are
no
more
than
pigeon
-
houses
,
in
respect
to
palaces
;
and
,
notwithstanding
the
extravagant
eulogiums
which
you
have
heard
of
the
French
king
's
houses
,
I
will
venture
to
affirm
that
the
king
of
England
is
better
,
I
mean
more
comfortably
,
lodged
.
<EOS>
I
ought
,
however
,
to
except
Fontainebleau
,
which
I
have
not
seen
.
  
<EOS>
The
city
of
Paris
is
said
to
be
five
leagues
,
or
fifteen
miles
,
in
circumference
;
and
if
it
is
really
so
,
it
must
be
much
more
populous
than
London
;
for
the
streets
are
very
narrow
,
and
the
houses
very
high
,
with
a
different
family
on
every
floor
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
measured
the
best
plans
of
these
two
royal
cities
,
and
am
certain
that
Paris
does
not
take
up
near
so
much
ground
as
London
and
Westminster
occupy
;
and
I
suspect
the
number
of
its
inhabitants
is
also
exaggerated
by
those
who
say
it
amounts
to
eight
hundred
thousand
,
that
is
two
hundred
thousand
more
than
are
contained
in
the
bills
of
mortality
.
<EOS>
The
hotels
of
the
French
noblesse
,
at
Paris
,
take
up
a
great
deal
of
room
,
with
their
courtyards
and
gardens
;
and
so
do
their
convents
and
churches
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
owned
,
indeed
,
that
their
streets
are
wonderfully
crouded
with
people
and
carriages
.
  
<EOS>
The
French
begin
to
imitate
the
English
,
but
only
in
such
particulars
as
render
them
worthy
of
imitation
.
<EOS>
When
I
was
last
at
Paris
,
no
person
of
any
condition
,
male
or
female
,
appeared
,
but
in
full
dress
,
even
when
obliged
to
come
out
early
in
the
morning
,
and
there
was
not
such
a
thing
to
be
seen
as
a
perruque
ronde
;
but
at
present
I
see
a
number
of
frocks
and
scratches
in
a
morning
,
in
the
streets
of
this
metropolis
.
<EOS>
They
have
set
up
a
petite
poste
,
on
the
plan
of
our
penny
-
post
,
with
some
improvements
;
and
I
am
told
there
is
a
scheme
on
foot
for
supplying
every
house
with
water
,
by
leaden
pipes
,
from
the
river
Seine
.
<EOS>
They
have
even
adopted
our
practice
of
the
cold
bath
,
which
is
taken
very
conveniently
,
in
wooden
houses
,
erected
on
the
side
of
the
river
,
the
water
of
which
is
let
in
and
out
occasionally
,
by
cocks
fixed
in
the
sides
of
the
bath
.
<EOS>
There
are
different
rooms
for
the
different
sexes
:
the
accommodations
are
good
,
and
the
expence
is
a
trifle
.
<EOS>
The
tapestry
of
the
Gobelins
is
brought
to
an
amazing
degree
of
perfection
;
and
I
am
surprised
that
this
furniture
is
not
more
in
fashion
among
the
great
,
who
alone
are
able
to
purchase
it
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
most
elegant
and
magnificent
ornament
,
which
would
always
nobly
distinguish
their
apartments
from
those
,
of
an
inferior
rank
;
and
in
this
they
would
run
no
risk
of
being
rivalled
by
the
bourgeois
.
<EOS>
At
the
village
of
Chaillot
,
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Paris
,
they
make
beautiful
carpets
and
screen
-
work
;
and
this
is
the
more
extraordinary
,
as
there
are
hardly
any
carpets
used
in
this
kingdom
.
<EOS>
In
almost
all
the
lodging
-
houses
,
the
floors
are
of
brick
,
and
have
no
other
kind
of
cleaning
,
than
that
of
being
sprinkled
with
water
,
and
swept
once
a
day
.
<EOS>
These
brick
floors
,
the
stone
stairs
,
the
want
of
wainscotting
in
the
rooms
,
and
the
thick
party
-
walls
of
stone
,
are
,
however
,
good
preservatives
against
fire
,
which
seldom
does
any
damage
in
this
city
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
wainscotting
,
the
walls
are
covered
with
tapestry
or
damask
.
<EOS>
The
beds
in
general
are
very
good
,
and
well
ornamented
,
with
testers
and
curtains
.
  
<EOS>
Twenty
years
ago
the
river
Seine
,
within
a
mile
of
Paris
,
was
as
solitary
as
if
it
had
run
through
a
desert
.
<EOS>
At
present
the
banks
of
it
are
adorned
with
a
number
of
elegant
houses
and
plantations
,
as
far
as
Marli
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
mention
the
machine
at
this
place
for
raising
water
,
because
I
know
you
are
well
acquainted
with
its
construction
;
nor
shall
I
say
any
thing
more
of
the
city
of
Paris
,
but
that
there
is
a
new
square
,
built
upon
an
elegant
plan
,
at
the
end
of
the
garden
of
the
Thuilleries
:
it
is
called
Place
de
Louis
XV
and
,
in
the
middle
of
it
,
there
is
a
good
equestrian
statue
of
the
reigning
king
.
  
<EOS>
You
have
often
heard
that
Louis
XIV
frequently
regretted
,
that
his
country
did
not
afford
gravel
for
the
walks
of
his
gardens
,
which
are
covered
with
a
white
,
loose
sand
,
very
disagreeable
both
to
the
eyes
and
feet
of
those
who
walk
upon
it
;
but
this
is
a
vulgar
mistake
.
<EOS>
There
is
plenty
of
gravel
on
the
road
between
Paris
and
Versailles
,
as
well
as
in
many
other
parts
of
this
kingdom
;
but
the
French
,
who
are
all
for
glare
and
glitter
,
think
the
other
is
more
gay
and
agreeable
:
one
would
imagine
they
did
not
feel
the
burning
reflexion
from
the
white
sand
,
which
in
summer
is
almost
intolerable
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
character
of
the
French
,
considered
as
a
people
,
there
are
undoubtedly
many
circumstances
truly
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
fashionable
people
,
who
go
a
hunting
,
are
equipped
with
their
jack
boots
,
bag
wigs
,
swords
and
pistols
:
<EOS>
but
I
saw
the
other
day
a
scene
still
more
grotesque
.
<EOS>
On
the
road
to
Choissi
,
a
fiacre
,
or
hackney
-
coach
,
stopped
,
and
out
came
five
or
six
men
,
armed
with
musquets
,
who
took
post
,
each
behind
a
separate
tree
.
<EOS>
I
asked
our
servant
who
they
were
imagining
they
might
be
archers
,
or
footpads
of
justice
,
in
pursuit
of
some
malefactor
.
<EOS>
But
guess
my
surprise
,
when
the
fellow
told
me
,
they
were
gentlemen
a
la
chasse
.
<EOS>
They
were
in
fact
come
out
from
Paris
,
in
this
equipage
,
to
take
the
diversion
of
hare
-
hunting
;
that
is
,
of
shooting
from
behind
a
tree
at
the
hares
that
chanced
to
pass
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
if
they
had
nothing
more
in
view
,
but
to
destroy
the
game
,
this
was
a
very
effectual
method
;
for
the
hares
are
in
such
plenty
in
this
neighbourhood
,
that
I
have
seen
a
dozen
together
,
in
the
same
field
.
<EOS>
I
think
this
way
of
hunting
,
in
a
coach
or
chariot
,
might
be
properly
adopted
at
London
,
in
favour
of
those
aldermen
of
the
city
,
who
are
too
unwieldy
to
follow
the
hounds
a
horseback
.
  
<EOS>
The
French
,
however
,
with
all
their
absurdities
,
preserve
a
certain
ascendancy
over
us
,
which
is
very
disgraceful
to
our
nation
;
and
this
appears
in
nothing
more
than
in
the
article
of
dress
.
<EOS>
We
are
contented
to
be
thought
their
apes
in
fashion
;
but
,
in
fact
,
we
are
slaves
to
their
taylors
,
mantua
-
makers
,
barbers
,
and
other
tradesmen
.
<EOS>
One
would
be
apt
to
imagine
that
our
own
tradesmen
had
joined
them
in
a
combination
against
us
.
<EOS>
When
the
natives
of
France
come
to
London
,
they
appear
in
all
public
places
,
with
cloaths
made
according
to
the
fashion
of
their
own
country
,
and
this
fashion
is
generally
admired
by
the
English
.
<EOS>
Why
,
therefore
,
do
n't
we
follow
it
implicitly
?
<EOS>
No
,
we
pique
ourselves
upon
a
most
ridiculous
deviation
from
the
very
modes
we
admire
,
and
please
ourselves
with
thinking
this
deviation
is
a
mark
of
our
spirit
and
liberty
.
<EOS>
But
,
we
have
not
spirit
enough
to
persist
in
this
deviation
,
when
we
visit
their
country
:
<EOS>
otherwise
,
perhaps
,
they
would
come
to
admire
and
follow
our
example
:
for
,
certainly
,
in
point
of
true
taste
,
the
fashions
of
both
countries
are
equally
absurd
.
<EOS>
At
present
,
the
skirts
of
the
English
descend
from
the
fifth
rib
to
the
calf
of
the
leg
,
and
give
the
coat
the
form
of
a
Jewish
gaberdine
;
and
our
hats
seem
to
be
modelled
after
that
which
Pistol
wears
upon
the
stage
.
<EOS>
In
France
,
the
haunch
buttons
and
pocketholes
are
within
half
a
foot
of
the
coat
's
extremity
:
their
hats
look
as
if
they
had
been
pared
round
the
brims
,
and
the
crown
is
covered
with
a
kind
of
cordage
,
which
,
in
my
opinion
,
produces
a
very
beggarly
effect
.
<EOS>
In
every
other
circumstance
of
dress
,
male
and
female
,
the
contrast
between
the
two
nations
,
appears
equally
glaring
.
<EOS>
What
is
the
consequence
?
<EOS>
when
an
Englishman
comes
to
Paris
,
he
can
not
appear
until
he
has
undergone
a
total
metamorphosis
.
<EOS>
At
his
first
arrival
he
finds
it
necessary
to
send
for
the
taylor
,
perruquier
,
hatter
,
shoemaker
,
and
every
other
tradesman
concerned
in
the
equipment
of
the
human
body
.
<EOS>
He
must
even
change
his
buckles
,
and
the
form
of
his
ruffles
;
and
,
though
at
the
risque
of
his
life
,
suit
his
cloaths
to
the
mode
of
the
season
.
<EOS>
For
example
,
though
the
weather
should
be
never
so
cold
,
he
must
wear
his
habit
d'ete
,
or
demi
-
saison
.
<EOS>
without
presuming
to
put
on
a
warm
dress
before
the
day
which
fashion
has
fixed
for
that
purpose
;
and
neither
old
age
nor
infirmity
will
excuse
a
man
for
wearing
his
hat
upon
his
head
,
either
at
home
or
abroad
.
<EOS>
Females
are
(
if
possible
)
still
more
subject
to
the
caprices
of
fashion
;
and
as
the
articles
of
their
dress
are
more
manifold
,
it
is
enough
to
make
a
man
's
heart
ake
to
see
his
wife
surrounded
by
a
multitude
of
cotturieres
,
milliners
,
and
tire
-
women
.
<EOS>
All
her
sacks
and
negligees
must
be
altered
and
new
trimmed
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
new
caps
,
new
laces
,
new
shoes
,
and
her
hair
new
cut
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
her
taffaties
for
the
summer
,
her
flowered
silks
for
the
spring
and
autumn
,
her
sattins
and
damasks
for
winter
.
<EOS>
The
good
man
,
who
used
to
wear
the
beau
drop
d'Angleterre
,
quite
plain
all
the
year
round
,
with
a
long
bob
,
or
tye
perriwig
,
must
here
provide
himself
with
a
camblet
suit
trimmed
with
silver
for
spring
and
autumn
,
with
silk
cloaths
for
summer
,
and
cloth
laced
with
gold
,
or
velvet
for
winter
;
and
he
must
wear
his
bag
-
wig
a
la
pigeon
.
<EOS>
This
variety
of
dress
is
absolutely
indispensible
for
all
those
who
pretend
to
any
rank
above
the
meer
bourgeois
.
<EOS>
On
his
return
to
his
own
country
,
all
this
frippery
is
useless
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
appear
in
London
until
he
has
undergone
another
thorough
metamorphosis
;
so
that
he
will
have
some
reason
to
think
,
that
the
tradesmen
of
Paris
and
London
have
combined
to
lay
him
under
contribution
:
and
they
,
no
doubt
,
are
the
directors
who
regulate
the
fashions
in
both
capitals
;
the
English
,
however
,
in
a
subordinate
capacity
:
for
the
puppets
of
their
making
will
not
pass
at
Paris
,
nor
indeed
in
any
other
part
of
Europe
;
whereas
a
French
petit
maitre
is
reckoned
a
complete
figure
every
where
,
London
not
excepted
.
<EOS>
Since
it
is
so
much
the
humour
of
the
English
at
present
to
run
abroad
,
I
wish
they
had
anti
-
gallican
spirit
enough
to
produce
themselves
in
their
own
genuine
English
dress
,
and
treat
the
French
modes
with
the
same
philosophical
contempt
,
which
was
shewn
by
an
honest
gentleman
,
distinguished
by
the
name
of
Wig
-
Middleton
.
<EOS>
That
unshaken
patriot
still
appears
in
the
same
kind
of
scratch
perriwig
,
skimming
-
dish
hat
,
and
slit
sleeve
,
which
were
worn
five
-
and
-
twenty
years
ago
,
and
has
invariably
persisted
in
this
garb
,
in
defiance
of
all
the
revolutions
of
the
mode
.
<EOS>
I
remember
a
student
in
the
temple
,
who
,
after
a
long
and
learned
investigation
of
the
to
kalon
,
or
beautiful
,
had
resolution
enough
to
let
his
beard
grow
,
and
wore
it
in
all
public
places
,
until
his
heir
at
law
applied
for
a
commission
of
lunacy
against
him
;
then
he
submitted
to
the
razor
,
rather
than
run
any
risque
of
being
found
non
compos
.
  
<EOS>
Before
I
conclude
,
I
must
tell
you
,
that
the
most
reputable
shop
-
keepers
and
tradesmen
of
Paris
think
it
no
disgrace
to
practise
the
most
shameful
imposition
.
<EOS>
I
myself
know
an
instance
of
one
of
the
most
creditable
marchands
in
this
capital
,
who
demanded
six
francs
an
ell
for
some
lutestring
,
laying
his
hand
upon
his
breast
at
the
same
time
,
and
declaring
en
conscience
,
that
it
had
cost
him
within
three
sols
of
the
money
.
<EOS>
Yet
in
less
than
three
minutes
,
he
sold
it
for
four
and
a
half
,
and
when
the
buyer
upbraided
him
with
his
former
declaration
,
he
shrugged
up
his
shoulders
,
saying
,
il
faut
marchander
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mention
this
as
a
particular
instance
.
<EOS>
The
same
mean
disingenuity
is
universal
all
over
France
,
as
I
have
been
informed
by
several
persons
of
veracity
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
letter
you
have
from
me
will
probably
be
dated
at
Nismes
,
or
Montpellier
.

ever
 
Yours

<EOS>
MADAM
,
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
much
pleased
if
the
remarks
I
have
made
on
the
characters
of
the
French
people
,
can
afford
you
the
satisfaction
you
require
.
<EOS>
With
respect
to
the
ladies
I
can
only
judge
from
their
exteriors
:
but
,
indeed
,
these
are
so
characteristic
,
that
one
can
hardly
judge
amiss
;
unless
we
suppose
that
a
woman
of
taste
and
sentiment
may
be
so
overruled
by
the
absurdity
of
what
is
called
fashion
,
as
to
reject
reason
,
and
disguise
nature
,
in
order
to
become
ridiculous
or
frightful
.
<EOS>
That
this
may
be
the
case
with
some
individuals
,
is
very
possible
.
<EOS>
I
have
known
it
happen
in
our
own
country
,
where
the
follies
of
the
French
are
adopted
and
exhibited
in
the
most
aukward
imitation
:
but
the
general
prevalence
of
those
preposterous
modes
,
is
a
plain
proof
that
there
is
a
general
want
of
taste
,
and
a
general
depravity
of
nature
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
pretend
to
describe
the
particulars
of
a
French
lady
's
dress
.
<EOS>
These
you
are
much
better
acquainted
with
than
I
can
pretend
to
be
:
but
this
I
will
be
bold
to
affirm
,
that
France
is
the
general
reservoir
from
which
all
the
absurdities
of
false
taste
,
luxury
,
and
extravagance
have
overflowed
the
different
kingdoms
and
states
of
Europe
.
<EOS>
The
springs
that
fill
this
reservoir
,
are
no
other
than
vanity
and
ignorance
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
superfluous
to
attempt
proving
from
the
nature
of
things
,
from
the
first
principles
and
use
of
dress
,
as
well
as
from
the
consideration
of
natural
beauty
,
and
the
practice
of
the
ancients
,
who
certainly
understood
it
as
well
as
the
connoisseurs
of
these
days
,
that
nothing
can
be
more
monstrous
,
inconvenient
,
and
contemptible
,
than
the
fashion
of
modern
drapery
.
<EOS>
You
yourself
are
well
aware
of
all
its
defects
,
and
have
often
ridiculed
them
in
my
hearing
.
<EOS>
I
shall
only
mention
one
particular
of
dress
essential
to
the
fashion
in
this
country
,
which
seems
to
me
to
carry
human
affectation
to
the
very
farthest
verge
of
folly
and
extravagance
;
that
is
,
the
manner
in
which
the
faces
of
the
ladies
are
primed
and
painted
.
<EOS>
When
the
Indian
chiefs
were
in
England
every
body
ridiculed
their
preposterous
method
of
painting
their
cheeks
and
eye
-
lids
;
but
this
ridicule
was
wrong
placed
.
<EOS>
Those
critics
ought
to
have
considered
,
that
the
Indians
do
not
use
paint
to
make
themselves
agreeable
;
but
in
order
to
be
the
more
terrible
to
their
enemies
.
<EOS>
It
is
generally
supposed
,
I
think
,
that
your
sex
make
use
of
fard
and
vermillion
for
very
different
purposes
;
namely
,
to
help
a
bad
or
faded
complexion
,
to
heighten
the
graces
,
or
conceal
the
defects
of
nature
,
as
well
as
the
ravages
of
time
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
enquire
at
present
,
whether
it
is
just
and
honest
to
impose
in
this
manner
on
mankind
:
if
it
is
not
honest
,
it
may
be
allowed
to
be
artful
and
politic
,
and
shews
,
at
least
,
a
desire
of
being
agreeable
.
<EOS>
But
to
lay
it
on
as
the
fashion
in
France
prescribes
to
all
the
ladies
of
condition
,
who
indeed
can
not
appear
without
this
badge
of
distinction
,
is
to
disguise
themselves
in
such
a
manner
,
as
to
render
them
odious
and
detestable
to
every
spectator
,
who
has
the
least
relish
left
for
nature
and
propriety
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
fard
or
white
,
with
which
their
necks
and
shoulders
are
plaistered
,
it
may
be
in
some
measure
excusable
,
as
their
skins
are
naturally
brown
,
or
sallow
;
but
the
rouge
,
which
is
daubed
on
their
faces
,
from
the
chin
up
to
the
eyes
,
without
the
least
art
or
dexterity
,
not
only
destroys
all
distinction
of
features
,
but
renders
the
aspect
really
frightful
,
or
at
best
conveys
nothing
but
ideas
of
disgust
and
aversion
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
that
without
this
horrible
masque
no
married
lady
is
admitted
at
court
,
or
in
any
polite
assembly
;
and
that
it
is
a
mark
of
distinction
which
no
bourgeoise
dare
assume
.
<EOS>
Ladies
of
fashion
only
have
the
privilege
of
exposing
themselves
in
these
ungracious
colours
.
<EOS>
As
their
faces
are
concealed
under
a
false
complexion
,
so
their
heads
are
covered
with
a
vast
load
of
false
hair
,
which
is
frizzled
on
the
forehead
,
so
as
exactly
to
resemble
the
wooly
heads
of
the
Guinea
negroes
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
natural
hue
of
it
,
this
is
a
matter
of
no
consequence
,
for
powder
makes
every
head
of
hair
of
the
same
colour
;
and
no
woman
appears
in
this
country
,
from
the
moment
she
rises
till
night
,
without
being
compleatly
whitened
.
<EOS>
Powder
or
meal
was
first
used
in
Europe
by
the
Poles
,
to
conceal
their
scald
heads
;
but
the
present
fashion
of
using
it
,
as
well
as
the
modish
method
of
dressing
the
hair
,
must
have
been
borrowed
from
the
Hottentots
,
who
grease
their
wooly
heads
with
mutton
suet
and
then
paste
it
over
with
the
powder
called
buchu
.
<EOS>
In
like
manner
,
the
hair
of
our
fine
ladies
is
frizzled
into
the
appearance
of
negroes
wool
,
and
stiffened
with
an
abominable
paste
of
hog
's
grease
,
tallow
,
and
white
powder
.
<EOS>
The
present
fashion
,
therefore
,
of
painting
the
face
,
and
adorning
the
head
,
adopted
by
the
beau
monde
in
France
,
is
taken
from
those
two
polite
nations
the
Chickesaws
of
America
and
the
Hottentots
of
Africa
.
<EOS>
On
the
whole
,
when
I
see
one
of
those
fine
creatures
sailing
along
,
in
her
taudry
robes
of
silk
and
gauze
,
frilled
,
and
flounced
,
and
furbelowed
,
with
her
false
locks
,
her
false
jewels
,
her
paint
,
her
patches
,
and
perfumes
;
I
can
not
help
looking
upon
her
as
the
vilest
piece
of
sophistication
that
art
ever
produced
.
  
<EOS>
This
hideous
masque
of
painting
,
though
destructive
of
all
beauty
,
is
,
however
,
favourable
to
natural
homeliness
and
deformity
.
<EOS>
It
accustoms
the
eyes
of
the
other
sex
,
and
in
time
reconciles
them
to
frightfull
objects
;
it
disables
them
from
perceiving
any
distinction
of
features
between
woman
and
woman
;
and
,
by
reducing
all
faces
to
a
level
,
gives
every
female
an
equal
chance
for
an
admirer
;
being
in
this
particular
analogous
to
the
practice
of
the
antient
Lacedemonians
,
who
were
obliged
to
chuse
their
helpmates
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
In
what
manner
the
insides
of
their
heads
are
furnished
,
I
would
not
presume
to
judge
from
the
conversation
of
a
very
few
to
whom
I
have
had
access
:
but
from
the
nature
of
their
education
,
which
I
have
heard
described
,
and
the
natural
vivacity
of
their
tempers
,
I
should
expect
neither
sense
,
sentiment
,
nor
discretion
.
<EOS>
From
the
nursery
they
are
allowed
,
and
even
encouraged
,
to
say
every
thing
that
comes
uppermost
;
by
which
means
they
acquire
a
volubility
of
tongue
,
and
a
set
of
phrases
,
which
constitutes
what
is
called
polite
conversation
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
they
obtain
an
absolute
conquest
over
all
sense
of
shame
,
or
rather
,
they
avoid
acquiring
this
troublesome
sensation
;
for
it
is
certainly
no
innate
idea
.
<EOS>
Those
who
have
not
governesses
at
home
,
are
sent
,
for
a
few
years
,
to
a
convent
,
where
they
lay
in
a
fund
of
superstition
that
serves
them
for
life
:
but
I
never
heard
they
had
the
least
opportunity
of
cultivating
the
mind
,
of
exercising
the
powers
of
reason
,
or
of
imbibing
a
taste
for
letters
,
or
any
rational
or
useful
accomplishment
.
<EOS>
After
being
taught
to
prattle
,
to
dance
and
play
at
cards
,
they
are
deemed
sufficiently
qualified
to
appear
in
the
grand
monde
,
and
to
perform
all
the
duties
of
that
high
rank
and
station
in
life
.
<EOS>
In
mentioning
cards
,
I
ought
to
observe
,
that
they
learn
to
play
not
barely
for
amusement
,
but
also
with
a
view
to
advantage
;
and
,
indeed
,
you
seldom
meet
with
a
native
of
France
,
whether
male
or
female
,
who
is
not
a
compleat
gamester
,
well
versed
in
all
the
subtleties
and
finesses
of
the
art
.
<EOS>
This
is
likewise
the
case
all
over
Italy
.
<EOS>
A
lady
of
a
great
house
in
Piedmont
,
having
four
sons
,
makes
no
scruple
to
declare
,
that
the
first
shall
represent
the
family
,
the
second
enter
into
the
army
,
the
third
into
the
church
,
and
that
she
will
breed
the
fourth
a
gamester
.
<EOS>
These
noble
adventurers
devote
themselves
in
a
particular
manner
to
the
entertainment
of
travellers
from
our
country
,
because
the
English
are
supposed
to
be
full
of
money
,
rash
,
incautious
,
and
utterly
ignorant
of
play
.
<EOS>
But
such
a
sharper
is
most
dangerous
,
when
he
hunts
in
couple
with
a
female
.
<EOS>
I
have
known
a
French
count
and
his
wife
,
who
found
means
to
lay
the
most
wary
under
contribution
.
<EOS>
He
was
smooth
,
supple
,
officious
,
and
attentive
:
she
was
young
,
handsome
,
unprincipled
,
and
artful
.
<EOS>
If
the
Englishman
marked
for
prey
was
found
upon
his
guard
against
the
designs
of
the
husband
,
then
madam
plied
him
on
the
side
of
gallantry
.
<EOS>
She
displayed
all
the
attractions
of
her
person
.
<EOS>
She
sung
,
danced
,
ogled
,
sighed
,
complimented
,
and
complained
.
<EOS>
If
he
was
insensible
to
all
her
charms
,
she
flattered
his
vanity
,
and
piqued
his
pride
,
by
extolling
the
wealth
and
generosity
of
the
English
;
and
if
he
proved
deaf
to
all
these
insinuations
she
,
as
her
last
stake
,
endeavoured
to
interest
his
humanity
and
compassion
.
<EOS>
She
expatiated
,
with
tears
in
her
eyes
,
on
the
cruelty
and
indifference
of
her
great
relations
;
represented
that
her
husband
was
no
more
than
the
cadet
of
a
noble
family
  
,
that
his
provision
was
by
no
means
suitable
.
<EOS>
either
to
the
dignity
of
his
rank
,
or
the
generosity
of
his
disposition
:
that
he
had
a
law
-
suit
of
great
consequence
depending
,
which
had
drained
all
his
finances
;
and
,
finally
,
that
they
should
be
both
ruined
,
if
they
could
not
find
some
generous
friend
,
who
would
accommodate
them
with
a
sum
of
money
to
bring
the
cause
to
a
determination
.
<EOS>
Those
who
are
not
actuated
by
such
scandalous
motives
,
become
gamesters
from
meer
habit
,
and
,
having
nothing
more
solid
to
engage
their
thoughts
,
or
employ
their
time
,
consume
the
best
part
of
their
lives
,
in
this
worst
of
all
dissipation
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
ignorant
that
there
are
exceptions
from
this
general
rule
:
I
know
that
France
has
produced
a
Maintenon
,
a
Sevigine
,
a
Scuderi
,
a
Dacier
,
and
a
Chatelet
;
but
I
would
no
more
deduce
the
general
character
of
the
French
ladies
from
these
examples
,
than
I
would
call
a
field
of
hemp
a
flower
-
garden
.
<EOS>
because
there
might
be
in
it
a
few
lillies
or
renunculas
planted
by
the
hand
of
accident
.
  
<EOS>
Woman
has
been
defined
a
weaker
man
;
but
in
this
country
the
men
are
,
in
my
opinion
,
more
ridiculous
and
insignificant
than
the
women
.
<EOS>
They
certainly
are
more
disagreeable
to
a
rational
enquirer
,
because
they
are
more
troublesome
.
<EOS>
Of
all
the
coxcombs
on
the
face
of
the
earth
,
a
French
petit
maitre
is
the
most
impertinent
:
and
they
are
all
petit
maitres
from
the
marquis
who
glitters
in
lace
and
embroidery
,
to
the
garcon
barbier
covered
with
meal
,
who
struts
with
his
hair
in
a
long
queue
,
and
his
hat
under
his
arm
.
<EOS>
I
have
already
observed
,
<EOS>
that
vanity
is
the
great
and
universal
mover
among
all
ranks
and
degrees
of
people
in
this
nation
;
and
as
they
take
no
pains
to
conceal
or
controul
it
,
they
are
hurried
by
it
into
the
most
ridiculous
and
indeed
intolerable
extravagance
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
talk
of
the
French
nation
,
I
must
again
except
a
great
number
of
individuals
,
from
the
general
censure
.
<EOS>
Though
I
have
a
hearty
contempt
for
the
ignorance
,
folly
,
and
presumption
which
characterise
the
generality
,
I
can
not
but
respect
the
talents
of
many
great
men
,
who
have
eminently
distinguished
themselves
in
every
art
and
science
:
these
I
shall
always
revere
and
esteem
as
creatures
of
a
superior
species
,
produced
,
for
the
wise
purposes
of
providence
,
among
the
refuse
of
mankind
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
absurd
to
conclude
that
the
Welch
or
Highlanders
are
a
gigantic
people
,
because
those
mountains
may
have
produced
a
few
individuals
near
seven
feet
high
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
equally
absurd
to
suppose
the
French
are
a
nation
of
philosophers
,
because
France
has
given
birth
to
a
Des
Cartes
,
a
Maupertuis
,
a
Reaumur
,
and
a
Buffon
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
not
even
deny
,
that
the
French
are
by
no
means
deficient
in
natural
capacity
;
but
they
are
at
the
same
time
remarkable
for
a
natural
levity
,
which
hinders
their
youth
from
cultivating
that
capacity
.
<EOS>
This
is
reinforced
by
the
most
preposterous
education
,
and
the
example
of
a
giddy
people
,
engaged
in
the
most
frivolous
pursuits
.
<EOS>
A
Frenchman
is
by
some
Jesuit
,
or
other
monk
,
taught
to
read
his
mother
tongue
,
and
to
say
his
prayers
in
a
language
he
does
not
understand
.
<EOS>
He
learns
to
dance
and
to
fence
,
by
the
masters
of
those
noble
sciences
.
<EOS>
He
becomes
a
compleat
connoisseur
in
dressing
hair
,
and
in
adorning
his
own
person
,
under
the
hands
and
instructions
of
his
barber
and
valet
de
chambre
.
<EOS>
If
he
learns
to
play
upon
the
flute
or
the
fiddle
,
he
is
altogether
irresistible
.
<EOS>
But
he
piques
himself
upon
being
polished
above
the
natives
of
any
other
country
by
his
conversation
with
the
fair
sex
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
this
communication
,
with
which
he
is
indulged
from
his
tender
years
,
he
learns
like
a
parrot
,
by
rote
,
the
whole
circle
of
French
compliments
,
which
you
know
are
a
set
of
phrases
ridiculous
even
to
a
proverb
;
and
these
he
throws
out
indiscriminately
to
all
women
,
without
distinction
in
the
exercise
of
that
kind
of
address
,
which
is
here
distinguished
by
the
name
of
gallantry
<EOS>
:
it
is
no
more
than
his
making
love
to
every
woman
who
will
give
him
the
hearing
.
<EOS>
It
is
an
exercise
,
by
the
repetition
of
which
he
becomes
very
pert
,
very
familiar
,
and
very
impertinent
.
<EOS>
Modesty
,
or
diffidence
,
I
have
already
said
,
is
utterly
unknown
among
them
,
and
therefore
I
wonder
there
should
be
a
term
to
express
it
in
their
language
.
  
<EOS>
If
I
was
obliged
to
define
politeness
,
I
should
call
it
,
the
art
of
making
one
's
self
agreeable
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
an
art
that
necessarily
implies
a
sense
of
decorum
,
and
a
delicacy
of
sentiment
.
<EOS>
These
are
qualities
,
of
which
(
as
far
as
I
have
been
able
to
observe
)
<EOS>
a
Frenchman
has
no
idea
;
therefore
he
never
can
be
deemed
polite
,
except
by
those
persons
among
whom
they
are
as
little
understood
.
<EOS>
His
first
aim
is
to
adorn
his
own
person
with
what
he
calls
fine
cloaths
,
that
is
the
frippery
of
the
fashion
.
<EOS>
It
is
no
wonder
that
the
heart
of
a
female
,
unimproved
by
reason
,
and
untinctured
with
natural
good
sense
,
should
flutter
at
the
sight
of
such
a
gaudy
thing
,
among
the
number
of
her
admirers
:
<EOS>
this
impression
is
enforced
by
fustian
compliments
,
which
her
own
vanity
interprets
in
a
literal
sense
,
and
still
more
confirmed
by
the
assiduous
attention
of
the
gallant
,
who
,
indeed
,
has
nothing
else
to
mind
.
<EOS>
A
Frenchman
in
consequence
of
his
mingling
with
the
females
from
his
infancy
,
not
only
becomes
acquainted
with
all
their
customs
and
humours
;
but
grows
wonderfully
alert
in
performing
a
thousand
little
offices
,
which
are
overlooked
by
other
men
,
whose
time
hath
been
spent
in
making
more
valuable
acquisitions
.
<EOS>
He
enters
,
without
ceremony
,
a
lady
's
bed
-
chamber
,
while
she
is
in
bed
,
reaches
her
whatever
she
wants
,
airs
her
shift
,
and
helps
to
put
it
on
.
<EOS>
He
attends
at
her
toilette
,
regulates
the
distribution
of
her
patches
,
and
advises
where
to
lay
on
the
paint
.
<EOS>
If
he
visits
her
when
she
is
dressed
,
and
perceives
the
least
impropriety
in
her
coeffure
,
he
insists
upon
adjusting
it
with
his
own
hands
:
if
he
sees
a
curl
,
or
even
a
single
hair
amiss
,
he
produces
his
comb
,
his
scissars
,
and
pomatum
,
and
sets
it
to
rights
with
the
dexterity
of
a
professed
friseur
.
<EOS>
He
"
squires
her
to
every
place
she
visits
,
either
on
business
,
or
pleasure
;
and
,
by
dedicating
his
whole
time
to
her
,
renders
himself
necessary
to
her
occasions
.
<EOS>
This
I
take
to
be
the
most
agreeable
side
of
his
character
:
let
us
view
him
on
the
quarter
of
impertinence
.
<EOS>
A
Frenchman
pries
into
all
your
secrets
with
the
most
impudent
and
importunate
curiosity
,
and
then
discloses
them
without
remorse
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
indisposed
,
he
questions
you
about
the
symptoms
of
your
disorder
,
with
more
freedom
than
your
physician
would
presume
to
use
;
very
often
in
the
grossest
terms
.
<EOS>
He
then
proposes
his
remedy
(
for
they
are
all
quacks
)
,
he
prepares
it
without
your
knowledge
,
and
worries
you
with
solicitation
to
take
it
,
without
paying
the
least
regard
to
the
opinion
of
those
whom
you
have
chosen
to
take
care
of
your
health
.
<EOS>
Let
you
be
ever
so
ill
,
or
averse
to
company
,
he
forces
himself
at
all
times
into
your
bed
-
chamber
,
and
if
it
is
necessary
to
give
him
a
peremptory
refusal
,
he
is
affronted
.
<EOS>
I
have
known
one
of
those
petit
maitres
insist
upon
paying
regular
visits
twice
a
day
to
a
poor
gentleman
who
was
delirious
;
and
he
conversed
with
him
on
different
subjects
,
till
he
was
in
his
last
agonies
.
<EOS>
This
attendance
is
not
the
effect
of
attachment
,
or
regard
,
but
of
sheer
vanity
,
that
he
may
afterwards
boast
of
his
charity
and
humane
disposition
:
<EOS>
though
,
of
all
the
people
I
have
ever
known
,
I
think
the
French
are
the
least
capable
of
feeling
for
the
distresses
of
their
fellow
creatures
.
<EOS>
Their
hearts
are
not
susceptible
of
deep
impressions
;
and
,
such
is
their
levity
,
that
the
imagination
has
not
time
to
brood
long
over
any
disagreeable
idea
,
or
sensation
.
<EOS>
As
a
Frenchman
piques
himself
on
his
gallantry
,
he
no
sooner
makes
a
conquest
of
a
female
's
heart
,
than
he
exposes
her
character
,
for
the
gratification
of
his
vanity
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
if
he
should
miscarry
in
his
schemes
,
he
will
forge
letters
and
stories
,
to
the
ruin
of
the
lady
's
reputation
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
species
of
perfidy
which
one
would
think
should
render
them
odious
and
detestable
to
the
whole
sex
;
but
the
case
is
otherwise
.
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Madam
;
but
women
are
never
better
pleased
,
than
when
they
see
one
another
exposed
;
and
every
individual
has
such
confidence
in
her
own
superior
charms
and
discretion
,
that
she
thinks
she
can
fix
the
most
volatile
,
and
reform
the
most
treacherous
lover
.
  
<EOS>
If
a
Frenchman
is
admitted
into
your
family
,
and
distinguished
by
repeated
marks
of
your
friendship
and
regard
,
the
first
return
he
makes
for
your
civilities
is
to
make
love
to
your
wife
,
if
she
is
handsome
;
if
not
,
to
your
sister
,
or
daughter
,
or
niece
.
<EOS>
If
he
suffers
a
repulse
from
your
wife
,
or
attempts
in
vain
to
debauch
your
sister
,
or
your
daughter
,
or
your
niece
,
he
will
,
rather
than
not
play
the
traitor
with
his
gallantry
,
make
his
addresses
to
your
grandmother
;
and
ten
to
one
,
but
in
one
shape
or
another
,
he
will
find
means
to
ruin
the
peace
of
a
family
,
in
which
he
has
been
so
kindly
entertained
.
<EOS>
What
he
can
not
accomplish
by
dint
of
compliment
,
and
personal
attendance
,
he
will
endeavour
to
effect
,
by
reinforcing
these
with
billets
-
doux
,
songs
,
and
verses
,
of
which
he
always
makes
a
provision
for
such
purposes
.
<EOS>
If
he
is
detected
in
these
efforts
of
treachery
,
and
reproached
with
his
ingratitude
,
he
impudently
declares
,
that
what
he
had
done
was
no
more
than
simple
gallantry
,
considered
in
France
as
an
indispensible
duty
on
every
man
who
pretended
to
good
breeding
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
he
will
even
affirm
,
that
his
endeavours
to
corrupt
your
wife
,
or
your
daughter
,
were
the
most
genuine
proofs
he
could
give
of
his
particular
regard
for
your
family
.
  
<EOS>
If
a
Frenchman
is
capable
of
real
friendship
,
it
must
certainly
be
the
most
disagreeable
present
he
can
possibly
make
to
a
man
of
a
true
English
character
,
You
know
,
Madam
,
we
are
naturally
taciturn
,
soon
tired
of
impertinence
,
and
much
subject
to
fits
of
disgust
.
<EOS>
Your
French
friend
intrudes
upon
you
at
all
hours
:
he
stuns
you
with
his
loquacity
:
he
teases
you
with
impertinent
questions
about
your
domestic
and
private
affairs
:
he
attempts
to
meddle
in
all
your
concerns
;
and
forces
his
advice
upon
you
with
the
most
unwearied
importunity
:
he
asks
the
price
of
every
thing
you
wear
,
and
,
so
sure
as
you
tell
him
undervalues
it
,
without
hesitation
:
he
affirms
it
is
in
a
bad
taste
,
ill
-
contrived
,
ill
-
made
;
that
you
have
been
imposed
upon
both
with
respect
to
the
fashion
and
the
price
;
that
the
marquise
of
this
,
or
the
countess
of
that
,
has
one
that
is
perfectly
elegant
,
quite
in
the
bon
ton
,
and
yet
it
cost
her
little
more
than
you
gave
for
a
thing
that
nobody
would
wear
.
  
<EOS>
If
there
were
five
hundred
dishes
at
table
,
a
Frenchman
will
eat
of
all
of
them
,
and
then
complain
he
has
no
appetite
.
<EOS>
This
I
have
several
times
remarked
.
<EOS>
A
friend
of
mine
gained
a
considerable
wager
upon
an
experiment
of
this
kind
:
the
petit
maitre
ate
of
fourteen
different
plats
,
besides
the
dessert
;
then
disparaged
the
cook
,
declaring
he
was
no
better
than
a
marmiton
,
or
turnspit
.
  
<EOS>
The
French
have
the
most
ridiculous
fondness
for
their
hair
,
and
this
<EOS>
I
believe
they
inherit
from
their
remote
ancestors
.
<EOS>
The
first
race
of
French
kings
were
distinguished
by
their
long
hair
,
and
certainly
the
people
of
this
country
consider
it
as
an
indispensible
ornament
.
<EOS>
A
Frenchman
will
sooner
part
with
his
religion
than
with
his
hair
,
which
,
indeed
,
no
consideration
will
induce
him
to
forego
.
<EOS>
I
know
a
gentleman
afflicted
with
a
continual
head
-
ach
,
and
a
defluxion
on
his
eyes
,
who
was
told
by
his
physician
that
the
best
chance
he
had
for
being
cured
,
would
be
to
have
his
head
close
shaved
,
and
bathed
every
day
in
cold
water
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
(
cried
he
)
cut
my
hair
?
<EOS>
Mr
Doctor
,
your
most
humble
servant
!
"
<EOS>
He
dismissed
his
physician
,
lost
his
eye
-
sight
,
and
almost
his
senses
,
and
is
now
led
about
with
his
hair
in
a
bag
,
and
a
piece
of
green
silk
hanging
like
a
screen
before
his
face
.
<EOS>
Count
Saxe
,
and
other
military
writers
have
demonstrated
the
absurdity
of
a
soldier
's
wearing
a
long
head
of
hair
;
nevertheless
,
every
soldier
in
this
country
wears
a
long
queue
,
which
makes
a
delicate
mark
on
his
white
cloathing
;
and
this
ridiculous
foppery
has
descended
even
to
the
lowest
class
of
people
.
<EOS>
The
decrotteur
,
who
cleans
your
shoes
at
the
corner
of
the
Pont
Neuf
,
has
a
tail
of
this
kind
hanging
down
to
his
rump
,
and
even
the
peasant
who
drives
an
ass
loaded
with
dung
,
wears
his
hair
en
queue
,
though
,
perhaps
,
he
has
neither
shirt
nor
breeches
.
<EOS>
This
is
the
ornament
upon
which
he
bestows
much
time
and
pains
,
and
in
the
exhibition
of
which
he
finds
full
gratification
for
his
vanity
.
<EOS>
Considering
the
harsh
features
of
the
common
people
in
this
country
,
their
diminutive
stature
,
their
grimaces
,
and
that
long
appendage
,
they
have
no
small
resemblance
to
large
baboons
walking
upright
;
and
perhaps
this
similitude
has
helped
to
entail
upon
them
the
ridicule
of
their
neighbours
.
  
<EOS>
A
French
friend
tires
out
your
patience
with
long
visits
;
and
,
far
from
taking
the
most
palpable
hints
to
withdraw
,
when
he
perceives
you
uneasy
<EOS>
he
observes
you
are
low
-
spirited
,
and
therefore
he
will
keep
you
company
.
<EOS>
This
perseverance
shews
that
he
must
either
be
void
of
penetration
,
or
that
his
disposition
must
be
truly
diabolical
.
<EOS>
Rather
than
be
tormented
with
such
a
fiend
,
a
man
had
better
turn
him
out
of
doors
,
even
though
at
the
hazard
of
being
run
thro
'
the
body
.
  
<EOS>
The
French
are
generally
counted
insincere
,
and
taxed
with
want
of
generosity
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
these
reproaches
are
not
well
founded
.
<EOS>
High
-
flown
professions
of
friendship
and
attachment
constitute
the
language
of
common
compliment
in
this
country
,
and
are
never
supposed
to
be
understood
in
the
literal
acceptation
of
the
words
;
and
,
if
their
acts
of
generosity
are
but
very
rare
,
we
ought
to
ascribe
that
rarity
,
not
so
much
to
a
deficiency
of
generous
sentiments
,
as
to
their
vanity
and
ostentation
,
which
engrossing
all
their
funds
,
utterly
disable
them
from
exerting
the
virtues
of
beneficence
.
<EOS>
Vanity
,
indeed
,
predominates
among
all
ranks
,
to
such
a
degree
,
that
they
are
the
greatest
egotists
in
the
world
;
and
the
most
insignificant
individual
talks
in
company
with
the
same
conceit
and
arrogance
,
as
a
person
of
the
greatest
importance
.
<EOS>
Neither
conscious
poverty
nor
disgrace
will
restrain
him
in
the
least
either
from
assuming
his
full
share
of
the
conversation
,
or
making
big
addresses
to
the
finest
lady
,
whom
he
has
the
smallest
opportunity
to
approach
:
nor
is
he
restrained
by
any
other
consideration
whatsoever
.
<EOS>
It
is
all
one
to
him
whether
he
himself
has
a
wife
of
his
own
,
or
the
lady
a
husband
;
whether
she
is
designed
for
the
cloister
,
or
pre
-
ingaged
to
his
best
friend
and
benefactor
.
<EOS>
He
takes
it
for
granted
that
his
addresses
can
not
but
be
acceptable
;
and
,
if
he
meets
with
a
repulse
,
he
condemns
her
taste
;
but
never
doubts
his
own
qualifications
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
a
great
many
things
to
say
of
their
military
character
,
and
their
punctilios
of
honour
,
which
last
are
equally
absurd
and
pernicious
;
but
as
this
letter
has
run
to
an
unconscionable
length
,
I
shall
defer
them
till
another
opportunity
.
<EOS>
Mean
-

I
have
the
honour
to
be
,
with
very
particular
esteem
 
<EOS>
Madam

Your
most
obedient
servant

<EOS>
To
MR
M
    
LYONS
,
October
19
,
1763
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
I
was
favoured
with
yours
at
Paris
,
and
look
upon
your
reproaches
as
the
proof
of
your
friendship
.
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
I
considered
all
the
letters
I
have
hitherto
written
on
the
subject
of
my
travels
,
as
written
to
your
society
in
general
,
though
they
have
been
addressed
to
one
individual
of
it
;
and
if
they
contain
any
thing
that
can
either
amuse
or
inform
,
I
desire
that
henceforth
all
I
send
may
be
freely
perused
by
all
the
members
.
  
<EOS>
With
respect
to
my
health
,
about
which
you
so
kindly
enquire
,
I
have
nothing
new
to
communicate
.
<EOS>
I
had
reason
to
think
that
my
bathing
in
the
sea
at
Boulogne
 
produced
a
good
effect
,
in
strengthening
my
relaxed
fibres
.
<EOS>
You
know
how
subject
I
was
to
colds
in
England
;
that
I
could
not
stir
abroad
after
sun
-
set
,
nor
expose
myself
to
the
smallest
damp
,
nor
walk
till
the
least
moisture
appeared
on
my
skin
,
without
being
laid
up
for
ten
days
or
a
fortnight
.
<EOS>
At
Paris
,
however
,
I
went
out
every
day
,
with
my
hat
under
my
arm
,
though
the
weather
was
wet
and
cold
:
I
walked
in
the
garden
at
Versailles
even
after
it
was
dark
,
with
my
head
uncovered
,
on
a
cold
evening
,
when
the
ground
was
far
from
being
dry
:
<EOS>
nay
,
at
Marli
,
I
sauntered
above
a
mile
through
damp
alleys
,
and
wet
grass
:
<EOS>
and
from
none
of
these
risques
did
I
feel
the
least
inconvenience
.
  
<EOS>
In
one
of
our
excursions
we
visited
the
manufacture
for
porcelain
,
which
the
king
of
France
has
established
at
the
village
of
St
Cloud
,
on
the
road
to
Versailles
,
and
which
is
,
indeed
,
a
noble
monument
of
his
munificence
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
very
large
building
,
both
commodious
and
magnificent
,
where
a
great
number
of
artists
are
employed
,
and
where
this
elegant
superfluity
is
carried
to
as
great
perfection
as
it
ever
was
at
Dresden
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
after
all
,
I
know
not
whether
the
porcelain
made
at
Chelsea
may
not
vie
with
the
productions
either
of
Dresden
,
or
St
Cloud
.
<EOS>
If
it
falls
short
of
either
,
it
is
not
in
the
design
,
painting
,
enamel
,
or
other
ornaments
,
but
only
in
the
composition
of
the
metal
,
and
the
method
of
managing
it
in
the
furnace
.
<EOS>
Our
porcelain
seems
to
be
a
partial
vitrification
of
levigated
flint
and
fine
pipe
clay
,
mixed
together
in
a
certain
proportion
;
and
if
the
pieces
are
not
removed
from
the
fire
in
the
very
critical
moment
,
they
will
be
either
too
little
,
or
too
much
vitrified
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
case
,
I
apprehend
they
will
not
acquire
a
proper
degree
of
cohesion
;
they
will
be
apt
to
be
corroded
,
discoloured
,
and
to
crumble
,
like
the
first
essays
that
were
made
at
Chelsea
;
in
the
second
case
,
they
will
be
little
better
than
imperfect
glass
.
  
<EOS>
There
are
three
methods
of
travelling
from
Paris
to
Lyons
,
which
,
by
the
shortest
road
is
a
journey
of
about
three
hundred
and
sixty
miles
.
<EOS>
One
is
by
the
diligence
,
or
stagecoach
,
which
performs
it
in
five
days
;
and
every
passenger
pays
one
hundred
livres
,
in
consideration
of
which
,
he
not
only
has
a
seat
in
the
carriage
,
but
is
maintained
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
The
inconveniences
attending
this
way
of
travelling
are
these
.
<EOS>
You
are
crouded
into
the
carriage
,
to
the
number
of
eight
persons
,
so
as
to
sit
very
uneasy
,
and
sometimes
run
the
risque
of
being
stifled
among
very
indifferent
company
.
<EOS>
You
are
hurried
out
of
bed
,
at
four
,
three
,
nay
often
at
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
You
are
obliged
to
eat
in
the
French
way
,
which
is
very
disagreeable
to
an
English
palate
;
and
,
at
Chalons
,
you
must
embark
upon
the
Saone
in
a
boat
,
which
conveys
you
to
Lyons
,
so
that
the
two
last
days
of
your
journey
are
by
water
.
<EOS>
All
these
were
insurmountable
objections
to
me
,
who
am
in
such
a
bad
state
of
health
,
troubled
with
an
asthmatic
cough
,
spitting
,
slow
fever
,
and
restlessness
,
which
demands
a
continual
change
of
place
,
as
well
as
free
air
,
and
room
for
motion
.
<EOS>
I
was
this
day
visited
by
two
young
gentlemen
,
sons
of
Mr
Guastaldi
,
late
minister
from
Genoa
at
London
.
<EOS>
I
had
seen
them
at
Paris
,
at
the
house
of
the
dutchess
of
Douglas
.
<EOS>
They
came
hither
,
with
their
conductor
,
in
the
diligence
,
and
assured
me
,
that
nothing
could
be
more
disagreeable
than
their
situation
in
that
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
Another
way
of
travelling
in
this
country
is
to
hire
a
coach
and
four
horses
;
and
this
method
I
was
inclined
to
take
:
but
when
I
went
to
the
bureau
,
where
alone
these
voitures
are
to
be
had
,
I
was
given
to
understand
,
that
it
would
cost
me
six
-
and
-
twenty
guineas
,
and
travel
so
slow
that
I
should
be
ten
days
upon
the
road
.
<EOS>
These
carriages
are
let
by
the
same
persons
who
farm
the
diligence
;
and
for
this
they
have
an
exclusive
privilege
,
which
makes
them
very
saucy
and
insolent
.
<EOS>
When
I
mentioned
my
servant
,
they
gave
me
to
understand
,
that
I
must
pay
two
loui'dores
more
for
his
seat
upon
the
coach
box
.
<EOS>
As
I
could
not
relish
these
terms
,
nor
brook
the
thoughts
of
being
so
long
upon
the
road
,
I
had
recourse
to
the
third
method
,
which
is
going
post
.
  
<EOS>
In
England
you
know
I
should
have
had
nothing
to
do
,
but
to
hire
a
couple
of
post
-
chaises
from
stage
to
stage
,
with
two
horses
in
each
;
but
here
the
case
is
quite
otherwise
.
<EOS>
The
post
is
farmed
from
the
king
,
who
lays
travellers
under
contribution
for
his
own
benefit
,
and
has
published
a
set
of
oppressive
ordonnances
,
which
no
stranger
nor
native
dares
transgress
.
<EOS>
The
postmaster
finds
nothing
but
horses
and
guides
:
the
carriage
you
yourself
must
provide
.
<EOS>
If
there
are
four
persons
within
the
carriage
,
you
are
obliged
to
have
six
horses
,
and
two
postillions
;
and
if
your
servant
sits
on
the
outside
,
either
before
or
behind
,
you
must
pay
for
a
seventh
.
<EOS>
You
pay
double
for
the
first
stage
from
Paris
,
and
twice
double
for
passing
through
Fontainbleau
when
the
court
is
there
,
as
well
as
at
coming
to
Lyons
,
and
at
leaving
this
city
.
<EOS>
These
are
called
royal
posts
,
and
are
undoubtedly
a
scandalous
imposition
.
  
<EOS>
There
are
two
post
roads
from
Paris
to
Lyons
,
one
of
sixty
-
five
posts
,
by
the
way
of
Moulins
;
the
other
of
fifty
-
nine
,
by
the
way
of
Dijon
in
Burgundy
.
<EOS>
This
last
I
chose
,
partly
to
save
sixty
livres
,
and
partly
to
see
the
wine
harvest
of
Burgundy
,
which
,
I
was
told
,
was
a
season
of
mirth
and
jollity
among
all
ranks
of
people
.
<EOS>
I
hired
a
very
good
coach
for
ten
loui'dores
to
Lyons
,
and
set
out
from
Paris
on
the
thirteenth
instant
,
with
six
horses
,
two
postillions
,
and
my
own
servant
on
horseback
.
<EOS>
We
made
no
stop
at
Fontainbleau
,
though
the
court
was
there
;
but
lay
at
Moret
,
which
is
one
stage
further
,
a
very
paltry
little
town
<EOS>
where
,
however
,
we
found
good
accommodation
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
not
pretend
to
describe
the
castle
or
palace
of
Fontainbleau
,
of
which
I
had
only
a
glimpse
in
passing
;
but
the
forest
,
in
the
middle
of
which
it
stands
,
is
a
noble
chace
of
great
extent
,
beautifully
wild
and
romantic
,
well
stored
with
game
of
all
sorts
,
and
abounding
with
excellent
timber
.
<EOS>
It
put
me
in
mind
of
the
New
Forest
in
Hampshire
;
but
the
hills
,
rocks
,
and
mountains
,
with
which
it
is
diversified
,
render
it
more
agreeable
.
  
<EOS>
The
people
of
this
country
dine
at
noon
,
and
travellers
always
find
an
ordinary
prepared
at
every
auberge
,
or
public
-
house
,
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
Here
they
sit
down
promiscuously
,
and
dine
at
so
much
a
head
.
<EOS>
The
usual
price
is
thirty
sols
for
dinner
,
and
forty
for
supper
,
including
lodging
;
for
this
moderate
expence
they
have
two
courses
and
a
dessert
.
<EOS>
If
you
eat
in
your
own
apartment
,
you
pay
,
instead
of
forty
sols
,
three
,
and
in
some
places
,
four
livres
ahead
.
<EOS>
I
and
my
family
could
not
well
dispense
with
our
tea
and
toast
in
the
morning
,
and
had
no
stomach
to
eat
at
noon
.
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
hate
French
cookery
,
and
abominate
garlick
,
with
which
all
their
ragouts
,
in
this
part
of
the
country
,
are
highly
seasoned
:
we
therefore
formed
a
different
plan
of
living
upon
the
road
.
<EOS>
Before
we
left
Paris
,
we
laid
in
a
stock
of
tea
,
chocolate
,
cured
neats
'
tongues
,
and
saucissons
,
or
Bologna
sausages
,
both
of
which
we
found
in
great
perfection
in
that
capital
,
where
,
indeed
,
there
are
excellent
provisions
of
all
sorts
.
<EOS>
About
ten
in
the
morning
we
stopped
to
breakfast
at
some
auberge
,
where
we
always
found
bread
,
butter
,
and
milk
.
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
we
ordered
a
poulard
or
two
to
be
roasted
,
and
these
,
wrapped
in
a
napkin
,
were
put
into
the
boot
of
the
coach
,
together
with
bread
,
wine
,
and
water
.
<EOS>
About
two
or
three
in
the
afternoon
,
while
the
horses
were
changing
,
we
laid
a
cloth
upon
our
knees
,
and
producing
our
store
,
with
a
few
earthen
plates
,
discussed
our
short
meal
without
further
ceremony
.
<EOS>
This
was
followed
by
a
dessert
of
grapes
and
other
fruit
,
which
we
had
also
provided
.
<EOS>
I
must
own
<EOS>
I
found
these
transient
refreshments
much
more
agreeable
than
any
regular
meal
I
ate
upon
the
road
.
<EOS>
The
wine
commonly
used
in
Burgundy
is
so
weak
and
thin
,
that
you
would
not
drink
it
in
England
.
<EOS>
The
very
best
which
they
sell
at
Dijon
,
the
capital
of
the
province
,
for
three
livres
a
bottle
,
is
in
strength
,
and
even
in
flavour
,
greatly
inferior
to
what
I
have
drank
in
London
.
<EOS>
I
believe
all
the
first
growth
is
either
consumed
in
the
houses
of
the
noblesse
,
or
sent
abroad
to
foreign
markets
.
<EOS>
I
have
drank
excellent
Burgundy
at
Brussels
for
a
florin
a
bottle
;
that
is
,
little
more
than
twenty
pence
sterling
.
  
<EOS>
The
country
from
the
forest
of
Fontainbleau
to
the
Lyonnois
,
through
which
we
passed
,
is
rather
agreeable
than
fertile
,
being
part
of
Champagne
and
the
dutchy
of
Burgundy
,
watered
by
three
pleasant
pastoral
rivers
,
the
Seine
,
the
Yonne
,
and
the
Saone
.
<EOS>
The
flat
country
is
laid
out
chiefly
for
corn
;
but
produces
more
rye
than
wheat
.
<EOS>
Almost
all
the
ground
seems
to
be
ploughed
up
,
so
that
there
is
little
or
nothing
lying
fallow
.
<EOS>
There
are
very
few
inclosures
,
scarce
any
meadow
ground
,
and
,
so
far
as
I
could
observe
,
a
great
scarcity
of
cattle
.
<EOS>
We
sometimes
found
it
very
difficult
 
to
procure
half
a
pint
of
milk
for
our
tea
.
<EOS>
In
Burgundy
I
saw
a
peasant
ploughing
the
ground
with
a
jack
-
ass
,
a
lean
cow
,
and
a
he
-
goat
,
yoked
together
.
<EOS>
It
is
generally
observed
,
that
a
great
number
of
black
cattle
are
bred
and
fed
on
the
mountains
of
Burgundy
,
which
are
the
highest
lands
in
France
;
but
I
saw
very
few
.
<EOS>
The
peasants
in
France
are
so
wretchedly
poor
,
and
so
much
oppressed
by
their
landlords
,
that
they
can
not
afford
to
inclose
their
grounds
,
or
give
a
proper
respite
to
their
lands
;
or
to
stock
their
farms
with
a
sufficient
number
of
black
cattle
to
produce
the
necessary
manure
,
without
which
agriculture
can
never
be
carried
to
any
degree
of
perfection
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
whatever
efforts
a
few
individuals
may
make
for
the
benefit
of
their
own
estates
,
husbandry
in
France
will
never
be
generally
improved
,
until
the
farmer
is
free
and
independent
.
  
<EOS>
From
the
frequency
of
towns
and
villages
,
I
should
imagine
this
country
is
very
populous
;
yet
it
must
be
owned
,
that
the
towns
are
in
general
thinly
inhabited
.
<EOS>
I
saw
a
good
number
of
country
seats
and
plantations
near
tile
banks
of
the
rivers
,
on
each
side
;
and
a
great
many
convents
,
sweetly
situated
,
on
rising
grounds
,
where
the
air
is
most
pure
,
and
the
prospect
most
agreeable
.
<EOS>
It
is
surprising
to
see
how
happy
the
founders
of
those
religious
houses
have
been
in
their
choice
of
situations
,
all
the
world
over
.
  
<EOS>
In
passing
through
this
country
,
I
was
very
much
struck
with
the
sight
of
large
ripe
clusters
of
grapes
,
entwined
with
the
briars
and
thorns
of
common
hedges
on
the
wayside
.
<EOS>
The
mountains
of
Burgundy
are
covered
with
vines
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
,
and
seem
to
be
raised
by
nature
on
purpose
to
extend
the
surface
,
and
to
expose
it
the
more
advantageously
to
the
rays
of
the
sun
.
<EOS>
The
vandange
was
but
just
begun
,
and
the
people
were
employed
in
gathering
the
grapes
;
but
I
saw
no
signs
of
festivity
among
them
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
their
joy
was
a
little
damped
by
the
bad
prospect
of
their
harvest
;
for
they
complained
that
the
weather
had
been
so
unfavourable
as
to
hinder
the
grapes
from
ripening
.
<EOS>
I
thought
,
indeed
,
there
was
something
uncomfortable
in
seeing
the
vintage
thus
retarded
till
the
beginning
of
winter
:
for
,
in
some
parts
,
I
found
the
weather
extremely
cold
;
particularly
at
a
place
called
Maison
-
neuve
,
where
we
lay
,
there
was
a
hard
frost
,
and
in
the
morning
the
pools
were
covered
with
a
thick
crust
of
ice
.
<EOS>
My
personal
adventures
on
the
road
were
such
as
will
not
bear
a
recital
.
<EOS>
They
consisted
of
petty
disputes
with
landladies
,
post-
masters
,
and
postillions
.
<EOS>
The
highways
seem
to
be
perfectly
safe
.
<EOS>
We
did
not
find
that
any
robberies
were
ever
committed
,
although
we
did
not
see
one
of
the
marechaussee
from
Paris
to
Lyons
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
marechaussee
are
a
body
of
troopers
<EOS>
well
mounted
,
maintained
in
France
as
safe
-
guards
to
the
public
roads
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
reproach
upon
England
that
some
such
patrol
is
not
appointed
for
the
protection
of
travellers
.
  
<EOS>
At
Sens
in
Champagne
,
my
servant
,
who
had
rode
on
before
to
bespeak
fresh
horses
,
told
me
,
that
the
domestic
of
another
company
had
been
provided
before
him
,
altho
'
<EOS>
it
was
not
his
turn
,
as
he
had
arrived
later
at
the
post
.
<EOS>
Provoked
at
this
partiality
,
I
resolved
to
chide
the
post
-
master
,
and
accordingly
addressed
myself
to
a
person
who
stood
at
the
door
of
the
auberge
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
jolly
figure
,
fat
and
fair
,
dressed
in
an
odd
kind
of
garb
,
with
a
gold
laced
cap
on
his
head
,
and
a
cambric
handkerchief
pinned
to
his
middle
.
<EOS>
The
sight
of
such
a
fantastic
petit
maitre
,
in
the
character
of
a
post
-
master
,
increased
my
spleen
.
<EOS>
I
called
to
him
with
an
air
of
authority
,
mixed
with
indignation
,
and
when
he
came
up
to
the
coach
,
asked
in
a
peremptory
tone
,
if
he
did
not
understand
the
king
's
ordonnance
concerning
the
regulation
of
the
posts
?
<EOS>
He
laid
his
hand
upon
his
breast
;
but
before
he
could
make
any
answer
,
I
pulled
out
the
post
-
book
,
and
began
to
read
,
with
great
vociferation
,
the
article
which
orders
,
that
the
traveller
who
comes
first
shall
be
first
served
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
fresh
horses
being
put
to
the
carriage
,
and
the
postillions
mounted
,
the
coach
set
off
all
of
a
sudden
,
with
uncommon
speed
.
<EOS>
I
imagined
the
post
-
master
had
given
the
fellows
a
signal
to
be
gone
,
and
,
in
this
persuasion
,
thrusting
my
head
out
at
the
window
,
I
bestowed
some
epithets
upon
him
,
which
must
have
sounded
very
harsh
in
the
ears
of
a
Frenchman
.
<EOS>
We
stopped
for
a
refreshment
at
a
little
town
called
Joigne
-
ville
,
where
(
by
the
bye
)
I
was
scandalously
imposed
upon
,
and
even
abused
by
a
virago
of
a
landlady
;
then
proceeding
to
the
next
stage
,
I
was
given
to
understand
we
could
not
be
supplied
with
fresh
horses
.
<EOS>
Here
I
perceived
at
the
door
of
the
inn
,
the
same
person
whom
I
had
reproached
at
Sens
.
<EOS>
He
came
up
to
the
coach
,
and
told
me
,
that
notwithstanding
what
the
guides
had
said
,
I
should
have
fresh
horses
in
a
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
I
imagined
he
was
master
both
of
this
house
and
the
auberge
at
Sens
,
between
which
he
passed
and
repassed
occasionally
;
and
that
he
was
now
desirous
of
making
me
amends
for
the
affront
he
had
put
upon
me
at
the
other
place
.
<EOS>
Observing
that
one
of
the
trunks
behind
was
a
little
displaced
,
he
assisted
my
servant
in
adjusting
it
:
then
he
entered
into
conversation
with
me
,
and
gave
me
to
understand
,
that
in
a
post
-
chaise
,
which
we
had
passed
,
was
an
English
gentleman
on
his
return
from
Italy
.
<EOS>
I
wanted
to
know
who
he
was
,
and
when
he
said
he
could
not
tell
,
I
asked
him
,
in
a
very
abrupt
manner
,
why
he
had
not
enquired
of
his
servant
.
<EOS>
He
shrugged
up
his
shoulders
,
and
retired
to
the
inn
door
.
<EOS>
Having
waited
about
half
an
hour
,
I
beckoned
to
him
,
and
when
he
approached
,
upbraided
him
with
having
told
me
that
I
should
be
supplied
with
fresh
horses
in
a
few
minutes
:
he
seemed
shocked
,
and
answered
,
that
he
thought
he
had
reason
for
what
he
said
,
observing
,
that
it
was
as
disagreeable
to
him
as
to
me
to
wait
for
a
relay
.
<EOS>
As
it
began
to
rain
,
I
pulled
up
the
glass
in
his
face
,
and
he
withdrew
again
to
the
door
,
seemingly
ruffled
at
my
deportment
.
<EOS>
In
a
little
time
the
horses
arrived
,
and
three
of
them
were
immediately
put
to
a
very
handsome
post
-
chaise
,
into
which
he
stepped
,
and
set
out
,
accompanied
by
a
man
in
a
rich
livery
on
horseback
.
<EOS>
Astonished
at
this
circumstance
,
I
asked
the
hostler
who
he
was
,
and
he
replied
,
that
he
was
a
man
of
fashion
(
un
seigneur
)
who
lived
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Auxerre
.
<EOS>
I
was
much
mortified
to
find
that
I
had
treated
a
nobleman
so
scurvily
,
and
scolded
my
own
people
for
not
having
more
penetration
than
myself
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
he
did
not
fail
to
descant
upon
the
brutal
behaviour
of
the
Englishman
;
and
that
my
mistake
served
with
him
to
confirm
the
national
reproach
of
bluntness
,
and
ill
breeding
,
under
which
we
lie
in
this
country
.
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
I
was
that
day
more
than
usually
peevish
,
from
the
bad
weather
,
as
well
as
from
the
dread
of
a
fit
of
the
asthma
,
with
which
I
was
threatened
:
and
I
dare
say
my
appearance
seemed
as
uncouth
to
him
,
as
his
travelling
dress
appeared
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
grey
mourning
frock
under
a
wide
great
coat
,
a
bob
wig
without
powder
,
a
very
large
laced
hat
,
and
a
meagre
,
wrinkled
,
discontented
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
The
fourth
night
of
our
journey
we
lay
at
Macon
,
and
the
next
day
passed
through
the
Lyonnois
,
which
is
a
fine
country
,
full
of
towns
,
villages
,
and
gentlemen
's
houses
.
<EOS>
In
passing
through
the
Maconnois
,
we
saw
a
great
many
fields
of
Indian
corn
,
which
grows
to
the
height
of
six
or
seven
feet
:
it
is
made
into
flour
for
the
use
of
the
common
people
,
and
goes
by
the
name
of
Turkey
wheat
.
<EOS>
Here
likewise
,
as
well
as
in
Dauphine
,
they
raise
a
vast
quantity
of
very
large
pompions
,
with
the
contents
of
which
they
thicken
their
soup
and
ragouts
.
  
<EOS>
As
we
travelled
only
while
the
sun
was
up
,
on
account
of
my
ill
health
,
and
the
post
horses
in
France
are
in
bad
order
,
we
seldom
exceeded
twenty
leagues
a
day
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
directed
to
a
lodging
-
house
at
Lyons
,
which
being
full
they
shewed
us
to
a
tavern
,
where
I
was
led
up
three
pair
of
stairs
,
to
an
apartment
consisting
of
three
paltry
chambers
,
for
which
the
people
demanded
twelve
livres
a
day
:
for
dinner
and
supper
they
asked
thirty
-
two
,
besides
three
livres
for
my
servant
;
so
that
my
daily
expence
would
have
amounted
to
about
forty
-
seven
livres
,
exclusive
of
breakfast
and
coffee
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
I
was
so
provoked
at
this
extortion
,
that
,
without
answering
one
word
,
I
drove
to
another
auberge
,
where
I
now
am
,
and
pay
at
the
rate
of
two
-
and
-
thirty
livres
a
day
,
for
which
I
am
very
badly
lodged
,
and
but
very
indifferently
entertained
.
<EOS>
I
mention
these
circumstances
to
give
you
an
idea
of
the
imposition
to
which
strangers
are
subject
in
this
country
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
owned
,
however
,
that
in
the
article
of
eating
,
I
might
save
half
the
money
by
going
to
the
public
ordinary
;
but
this
is
a
scheme
of
oeconomy
,
which
(
exclusive
of
other
disagreeable
circumstances
)
neither
my
own
health
,
nor
that
of
my
wife
permits
me
to
embrace
.
<EOS>
My
journey
from
Paris
to
Lyons
,
including
the
hire
of
the
coach
,
and
all
expences
on
the
road
,
has
cost
me
,
within
a
few
shillings
,
forty
loui'dores
.
<EOS>
From
Paris
our
baggage
(
though
not
plombe
)
was
not
once
examined
till
we
arrived
in
this
city
,
at
the
gate
of
which
we
were
questioned
by
one
of
the
searchers
,
who
,
being
tipt
with
half
a
crown
,
allowed
us
to
proceed
without
further
enquiry
,
  
<EOS>
I
purposed
to
stay
in
Lyons
until
I
should
receive
some
letters
I
expected
from
London
,
to
be
forwarded
by
my
banker
at
Paris
:
but
the
enormous
expence
of
living
in
this
manner
has
determined
me
to
set
out
in
a
day
or
two
for
Montpellier
,
although
that
place
is
a
good
way
out
of
the
road
to
Nice
.
<EOS>
My
reasons
for
taking
that
route
I
shall
communicate
in
my
next
.

I
am

Dear
Sir

MONTPELLIER
,
November
5
,
1763
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
<EOS>
The
city
of
Lyons
has
been
so
often
and
so
circumstantially
described
,
that
I
can
not
pretend
to
say
any
thing
new
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
know
very
little
of
it
,
but
what
I
have
read
in
books
;
as
I
had
but
one
day
to
make
a
tour
of
the
streets
,
squares
,
and
other
remarkable
places
.
<EOS>
The
bridge
over
the
Rhone
seems
to
be
so
slightly
built
,
that
I
should
imagine
it
would
be
one
day
carried
away
by
that
rapid
river
;
especially
as
the
arches
are
so
small
,
that
,
after
great
rains
they
are
sometimes
bouchees
,
or
stopped
up
;
that
is
,
they
do
not
admit
a
sufficient
passage
for
the
encreased
body
of
the
water
.
<EOS>
In
order
to
remedy
this
dangerous
defect
,
in
some
measure
,
they
found
an
artist
some
years
ago
,
who
has
removed
a
middle
pier
,
and
thrown
two
arches
into
one
.
<EOS>
This
alteration
they
looked
upon
as
a
masterpiece
in
architecture
,
though
there
is
many
a
common
mason
in
England
,
who
would
have
undertaken
and
performed
the
work
,
without
valuing
himself
much
upon
the
enterprize
.
<EOS>
This
bridge
,
as
well
as
that
of
St
Esprit
,
is
built
,
not
in
a
strait
line
across
the
river
,
but
with
a
curve
,
which
forms
a
convexity
to
oppose
the
current
.
<EOS>
Such
a
bend
is
certainly
calculated
for
the
better
resisting
the
general
impetuosity
of
the
stream
,
and
has
no
bad
effect
to
the
eye
.
  
<EOS>
Lyons
is
a
great
,
populous
,
and
flourishing
city
but
I
am
surprised
to
find
it
is
counted
a
healthy
place
,
and
that
the
air
of
it
is
esteemed
favourable
to
pulmonic
disorders
.
<EOS>
It
is
situated
on
the
confluence
of
two
large
rivers
,
from
which
there
must
be
a
great
evaporation
,
as
well
as
from
the
low
marshy
grounds
,
which
these
rivers
often
overflow
.
<EOS>
This
must
render
the
air
moist
,
frouzy
,
and
even
putrid
,
if
it
was
not
well
ventilated
by
winds
from
the
mountains
of
Swisserland
;
and
in
the
latter
end
of
autumn
,
it
must
be
subject
to
fogs
.
<EOS>
The
morning
we
set
out
from
thence
,
the
whole
city
and
adjacent
plains
were
covered
with
so
thick
a
fog
,
that
we
could
not
distinguish
from
the
coach
the
head
of
the
foremost
mule
that
drew
it
.
<EOS>
Lyons
is
said
to
be
very
hot
in
summer
,
and
very
cold
in
winter
;
therefore
I
imagine
must
abound
with
inflammatory
and
intermittent
disorders
in
the
spring
and
fall
of
the
year
.
  
<EOS>
My
reasons
for
going
to
Montpellier
,
which
is
out
of
the
strait
road
to
Nice
,
were
these
.
<EOS>
Having
no
acquaintance
nor
correspondents
in
the
South
of
France
,
I
had
desired
my
credit
might
be
sent
to
the
same
house
to
which
my
heavy
baggage
was
consigned
.
<EOS>
I
expected
to
find
my
baggage
at
Cette
,
which
is
the
sea
-
port
of
Montpellier
;
and
there
I
also
hoped
to
find
a
vessel
,
in
which
I
might
be
transported
by
sea
to
Nice
,
without
further
trouble
.
<EOS>
I
longed
to
try
what
effect
the
boasted
air
of
Montpellier
would
have
upon
my
constitution
;
and
I
had
a
great
desire
to
see
the
famous
monuments
of
antiquity
in
and
about
the
ancient
city
of
Nismes
,
which
is
about
eight
leagues
short
of
Montpellier
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
inn
where
we
lodged
,
I
found
a
return
berline
,
belonging
to
Avignon
,
with
three
mules
,
which
are
the
animals
commonly
used
for
carriages
in
this
country
.
<EOS>
This
I
hired
for
five
loui'dores
.
<EOS>
The
coach
was
large
,
commodious
,
and
well
-
fitted
;
the
mules
were
strong
and
in
good
order
;
and
the
driver
,
whose
name
was
Joseph
,
appeared
to
be
a
sober
,
sagacious
,
intelligent
fellow
,
perfectly
well
acquainted
with
every
place
in
the
South
of
France
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
he
was
owner
of
the
coach
,
but
I
afterwards
learned
,
he
was
no
other
than
a
hired
servant
.
<EOS>
I
likewise
detected
him
in
some
knavery
,
in
the
course
of
our
journey
;
and
plainly
perceived
he
had
a
fellow
-
feeling
with
the
inn
-
keepers
on
the
road
;
but
,
in
other
respects
,
he
was
very
obliging
,
serviceable
,
and
even
entertaining
.
<EOS>
There
are
some
knavish
practices
of
this
kind
,
at
which
a
traveller
will
do
well
to
shut
his
eyes
,
for
his
own
ease
and
convenience
.
<EOS>
He
will
be
lucky
if
he
has
to
do
with
a
sensible
knave
,
like
Joseph
,
who
understood
his
interest
too
well
to
be
guilty
of
very
flagrant
pieces
of
imposition
.
  
<EOS>
A
man
,
impatient
to
be
at
his
journey
's
end
,
will
find
this
a
most
disagreeable
way
of
travelling
.
<EOS>
In
summer
it
must
be
quite
intolerable
.
<EOS>
The
mules
are
very
sure
,
but
very
slow
.
<EOS>
The
journey
seldom
exceeds
eight
leagues
,
about
four
and
twenty
miles
a
day
:
and
as
those
people
have
certain
fixed
stages
,
you
are
sometimes
obliged
to
rise
in
a
morning
before
day
;
a
circumstance
very
grievous
to
persons
in
ill
health
.
<EOS>
These
inconveniences
,
however
,
were
over
-
balanced
by
other
agreemens
.
<EOS>
We
no
,
sooner
quitted
Lyons
,
than
we
got
into
summer
weather
,
and
travelling
through
a
most
romantic
country
,
along
the
banks
of
the
Rhone
,
had
opportunities
(
from
the
slowness
of
our
pace
)
to
contemplate
its
beauties
at
leisure
.
  
<EOS>
The
rapidity
of
the
Rhone
is
,
in
a
great
measure
,
owing
to
its
being
confined
within
steep
banks
on
each
side
.
<EOS>
These
are
formed
almost
through
its
whole
course
,
by
a
double
chain
of
mountains
,
which
rise
with
all
abrupt
ascent
from
both
banks
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
The
mountains
are
covered
with
vineyards
,
interspersed
with
small
summer
-
houses
,
and
in
many
places
they
are
crowned
with
churches
,
chapels
,
and
convents
,
which
add
greatly
to
the
romantic
beauty
of
the
prospect
.
<EOS>
The
highroad
,
as
far
as
Avignon
,
lies
along
the
side
of
the
river
,
which
runs
almost
in
a
straight
line
,
and
affords
great
convenience
for
inland
commerce
.
<EOS>
Travellers
,
bound
to
the
southern
parts
of
France
,
generally
embark
in
the
diligence
at
Lyons
,
and
glide
down
this
river
with
great
velocity
,
passing
a
great
number
of
towns
and
villages
on
each
side
,
where
they
find
ordinaries
every
day
at
dinner
and
supper
.
<EOS>
In
good
weather
,
there
is
no
danger
in
this
method
of
travelling
,
 
'
till
you
come
to
the
Pont
St
Esprit
,
where
the
stream
runs
through
the
arches
with
such
rapidity
,
that
the
boat
is
sometimes
overset
.
<EOS>
But
those
passengers
who
are
under
any
apprehension
are
landed
above
-
bridge
,
and
taken
in
again
,
after
the
boat
has
passed
,
just
in
the
same
manner
as
at
London
Bridge
.
<EOS>
The
boats
that
go
up
the
river
are
drawn
against
the
stream
by
oxen
,
which
swim
through
one
of
the
arches
of
this
bridge
,
the
driver
sitting
between
the
horns
of
the
foremost
beast
.
<EOS>
We
set
out
from
Lyons
early
on
Monday
morning
,
and
as
a
robbery
had
been
a
few
days
before
committed
in
that
neighbourhood
,
I
ordered
my
servant
to
load
my
musquetoon
with
a
charge
of
eight
balls
.
<EOS>
By
the
bye
,
this
piece
did
not
fail
to
attract
the
curiosity
and
admiration
of
the
people
in
every
place
through
which
we
passed
.
<EOS>
The
carriage
no
sooner
halted
,
than
a
crowd
immediately
surrounded
the
man
to
view
the
blunderbuss
,
which
they
dignified
with
the
title
of
petit
canon
.
<EOS>
At
Nuys
in
Burgundy
,
he
fired
it
in
the
air
,
and
the
whole
mob
dispersed
,
and
scampered
off
like
a
flock
of
sheep
.
<EOS>
In
our
journey
hither
,
we
generally
set
out
in
a
morning
at
eight
o'clock
,
and
travelled
 
'
till
noon
,
when
the
mules
were
put
up
and
rested
a
couple
of
hours
.
<EOS>
During
this
halt
,
Joseph
went
to
dinner
,
and
we
went
to
breakfast
,
after
which
we
ordered
provision
for
our
refreshment
in
the
coach
,
which
we
took
about
three
or
four
in
the
afternoon
,
halting
for
that
purpose
,
by
the
side
of
some
transparent
brook
,
which
afforded
excellent
water
to
mix
with
our
wine
.
<EOS>
In
this
country
I
was
almost
poisoned
with
garlic
,
which
they
mix
in
their
ragouts
,
and
all
their
sauces
;
nay
,
the
smell
of
it
perfumes
the
very
chambers
,
as
well
as
every
person
you
approach
.
<EOS>
I
was
also
very
sick
of
been
ficas
,
grives
,
or
thrushes
,
and
other
little
birds
,
which
are
served
up
twice
a
day
at
all
ordinaries
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
They
make
their
appearance
in
vine
-
leaves
,
and
are
always
half
raw
,
in
which
condition
the
French
choose
to
eat
them
,
rather
than
run
the
risque
of
losing
the
juice
by
over
-
roasting
.
  
<EOS>
The
peasants
on
the
South
of
France
are
poorly
clad
,
and
look
as
if
they
were
half
-
starved
,
diminutive
,
swarthy
,
and
meagre
;
and
yet
the
common
people
who
travel
,
live
luxuriously
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
Every
carrier
and
mule
-
driver
has
two
meals
a
day
,
consisting
each
of
a
couple
of
courses
and
a
dessert
,
with
tolerable
small
wine
.
<EOS>
That
which
is
called
hermitage
,
and
grows
in
this
province
of
Dauphine
,
is
sold
on
the
spot
for
three
livres
a
bottle
.
<EOS>
The
common
draught
,
which
you
have
at
meals
in
this
country
,
is
remarkably
strong
,
though
in
flavour
much
inferior
to
that
of
Burgundy
.
<EOS>
The
accommodation
is
tolerable
,
though
they
demand
(
even
in
this
cheap
country
)
<EOS>
the
exorbitant
price
of
four
livres
a
head
for
every
meal
,
of
those
who
choose
to
eat
in
their
own
apartments
.
<EOS>
I
insisted
,
however
,
upon
paying
them
with
three
,
which
they
received
,
though
not
without
murmuring
and
seeming
discontented
.
<EOS>
In
this
journey
,
we
found
plenty
of
good
mutton
,
pork
,
poultry
,
and
game
,
including
the
red
partridge
,
which
is
near
twice
as
big
as
the
partridge
of
England
.
<EOS>
Their
hares
are
likewise
surprisingly
large
and
juicy
.
<EOS>
We
saw
great
flocks
of
black
turkeys
feeding
in
the
fields
,
but
no
black
cattle
;
and
milk
was
so
scarce
,
that
sometimes
we
were
obliged
to
drink
our
tea
without
it
.
  
<EOS>
One
day
perceiving
a
meadow
on
the
side
of
the
road
,
full
of
a
flower
which
I
took
to
be
the
crocus
,
I
desired
my
servant
to
alight
and
pull
some
of
them
.
<EOS>
He
delivered
the
musquetoon
to
Joseph
,
who
began
to
tamper
with
it
,
and
off
it
went
with
a
prodigious
report
,
augmented
by
an
eccho
from
the
mountains
that
skirted
the
road
.
<EOS>
The
mules
were
so
frightened
,
that
they
went
off
at
the
gallop
;
and
Joseph
,
for
some
minutes
,
could
neither
manage
the
reins
,
nor
open
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
recollected
himself
,
and
the
cattle
were
stopt
,
by
the
assistance
of
the
servant
,
to
whom
he
delivered
the
musquetoon
,
with
a
significant
shake
of
the
head
.
<EOS>
Then
alighting
from
the
box
,
he
examined
the
heads
of
his
three
mules
,
and
kissed
each
of
them
in
his
turn
.
<EOS>
Finding
they
had
received
no
damage
,
he
came
up
to
the
coach
,
with
a
pale
visage
and
staring
eyes
,
and
said
it
was
God
's
mercy
he
had
not
killed
his
beasts
.
<EOS>
I
answered
,
that
it
was
a
greater
mercy
he
had
not
killed
his
passengers
;
for
the
muzzle
of
the
piece
might
have
been
directed
our
way
as
well
as
any
other
,
and
in
that
case
Joseph
might
have
been
hanged
for
murder
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
as
good
be
hanged
(
said
he
)
for
murder
,
as
be
ruined
by
the
loss
of
my
cattle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
adventure
made
such
an
impression
upon
him
,
that
he
recounted
it
to
every
person
we
met
;
nor
would
he
ever
touch
the
blunderbuss
from
that
day
.
<EOS>
I
was
often
diverted
with
the
conversation
of
this
fellow
,
who
was
very
arch
and
very
communicative
.
<EOS>
Every
afternoon
,
he
used
to
stand
upon
the
foot
-
board
,
at
the
side
of
the
coach
,
and
discourse
with
us
an
hour
together
.
<EOS>
Passing
by
the
gibbet
of
Valencia
,
which
stands
very
near
the
high
-
road
,
we
saw
one
body
hanging
quite
naked
,
and
another
lying
broken
on
the
wheel
.
<EOS>
I
recollected
,
that
Mandrin
had
suffered
in
this
place
,
and
calling
to
Joseph
to
mount
the
foot
-
board
,
asked
if
he
had
ever
seen
that
famous
adventurer
.
<EOS>
At
mention
of
the
name
of
Mandrin
,
the
tear
started
in
Joseph
's
eye
,
he
discharged
a
deep
sigh
,
or
rather
groan
,
and
told
me
he
was
his
dear
friend
.
<EOS>
I
was
a
little
startled
at
this
declaration
;
however
,
I
concealed
my
thoughts
,
and
began
to
ask
questions
about
the
character
and
exploits
of
a
man
who
had
made
such
noise
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
He
told
me
,
Mandrin
was
a
native
of
Valencia
,
of
mean
extraction
:
that
he
had
served
as
a
soldier
in
the
army
,
and
afterwards
acted
as
maltotier
,
or
tax
-
gatherer
:
that
at
length
he
turned
contrebandier
,
or
smuggler
,
and
by
his
superior
qualities
,
raised
himself
to
the
command
of
a
formidable
gang
,
consisting
of
five
hundred
persons
well
armed
with
carbines
and
pistols
.
<EOS>
He
had
fifty
horses
for
his
troopers
,
and
three
hundred
mules
for
the
carriage
of
his
merchandize
.
<EOS>
His
head
-
quarters
were
in
Savoy
:
but
he
made
incursions
into
Dauphine
,
and
set
the
marechaussee
at
defiance
.
<EOS>
He
maintained
several
bloody
skirmishes
with
these
troopers
,
as
well
as
with
other
regular
detachments
,
and
in
all
those
actions
signalized
himself
by
his
courage
and
conduct
.
<EOS>
Coming
up
at
one
time
with
fifty
of
the
marechaussee
who
were
in
quest
of
him
,
he
told
them
very
calmly
,
he
had
occasion
for
their
horses
and
acoutrements
,
and
desired
them
to
dismount
.
<EOS>
At
that
instant
his
gang
appeared
,
and
the
troopers
complied
with
his
request
,
without
making
the
least
opposition
.
<EOS>
Joseph
said
he
was
as
generous
as
he
was
brave
,
and
never
molested
travellers
,
nor
did
the
least
injury
to
the
poor
;
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
relieved
them
very
often
.
<EOS>
He
used
to
oblige
the
gentlemen
in
the
country
to
take
his
merchandize
,
his
tobacco
,
brandy
,
and
muslins
,
at
his
own
price
;
and
,
in
the
same
manner
,
he
laid
the
open
towns
under
contribution
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
no
merchandize
,
he
borrowed
money
off
them
upon
the
credit
of
what
he
should
bring
when
he
was
better
provided
.
<EOS>
He
was
at
last
betrayed
,
by
his
wench
,
to
the
colonel
of
a
French
regiment
,
who
went
with
a
detachment
in
the
night
to
the
place
where
he
lay
in
Savoy
,
and
surprized
him
in
a
wood
-
house
,
while
his
people
were
absent
in
different
parts
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
For
this
intrusion
,
the
court
of
France
made
an
apology
to
the
king
of
Sardinia
,
in
whose
territories
he
was
taken
.
<EOS>
Mandrin
being
conveyed
to
Valencia
,
his
native
place
,
was
for
some
time
permitted
to
go
abroad
,
under
a
strong
guard
,
with
chains
upon
his
legs
;
and
here
he
conversed
freely
with
all
sorts
of
people
,
flattering
himself
with
the
hopes
of
a
pardon
,
in
which
,
however
,
he
was
disappointed
.
<EOS>
An
order
came
from
court
to
bring
him
to
his
trial
,
when
he
was
found
guilty
,
and
condemned
to
be
broke
on
the
wheel
.
<EOS>
Joseph
said
he
drank
a
bottle
of
wine
with
him
the
night
before
his
execution
.
<EOS>
He
bore
his
fate
with
great
resolution
,
observing
that
if
the
letter
which
he
had
written
to
the
King
had
been
delivered
,
he
certainly
should
have
obtained
his
Majesty
's
pardon
.
<EOS>
His
executioner
was
one
of
his
own
gang
,
who
was
pardoned
on
condition
of
performing
this
office
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
that
criminals
broke
upon
the
wheel
are
first
strangled
,
unless
the
sentence
imports
,
that
they
shall
be
broke
alive
.
<EOS>
As
Mandrin
had
not
been
guilty
of
cruelty
in
the
course
of
his
delinquency
,
he
was
indulged
with
this
favour
.
<EOS>
Speaking
to
the
executioner
,
whom
he
had
formerly
commanded
,
"
Joseph
(
dit
il
)
,
<EOS>
je
ne
veux
pas
que
tu
<EOS>
me
touche
,
jusqu'a
ce
que
je
sois
roid
mort
,
"
"
Joseph
<EOS>
,
"
said
he
,
"
thou
shalt
not
touch
me
till
I
am
quite
dead
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Our
driver
had
no
sooner
pronounced
these
words
,
than
I
was
struck
with
a
suspicion
,
that
he
himself
was
the
executioner
of
his
friend
Mandrin
.
<EOS>
On
that
suspicion
,
I
exclaimed
,
"
Ah
!
ah
!
<EOS>
Joseph
!
"
<EOS>
The
fellow
blushed
up
to
the
eyes
,
and
said
,
Oui
,
son
nom
etoit
Joseph
aussi
bien
que
le
mien
,
"
Yes
,
he
was
called
Joseph
,
as
I
am
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
think
proper
to
prosecute
the
inquiry
;
but
did
not
much
relish
the
nature
of
Joseph
's
connexions
.
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
he
had
very
much
the
looks
of
a
ruffian
;
though
,
I
must
own
,
his
behaviour
was
very
obliging
and
submissive
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
fifth
day
of
our
journey
,
in
the
morning
,
we
passed
the
famous
bridge
at
St
Esprit
,
which
to
be
sure
is
a
great
curiosity
,
from
its
length
,
and
the
number
of
its
arches
:
but
these
arches
are
too
small
:
the
passage
above
is
too
narrow
;
and
the
whole
appears
to
be
too
slight
,
considering
the
force
and
impetuosity
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
comparable
to
the
bridge
at
Westminster
,
either
for
beauty
or
solidity
.
<EOS>
Here
we
entered
Languedoc
,
and
were
stopped
to
have
our
baggage
examined
;
but
the
searcher
,
being
tipped
with
a
three
-
livre
piece
,
allowed
it
to
pass
.
<EOS>
Before
we
leave
Dauphine
,
I
must
observe
,
that
I
was
not
a
little
surprized
to
see
figs
and
chestnuts
growing
in
the
open
fields
,
at
the
discretion
of
every
passenger
.
<EOS>
It
was
this
day
<EOS>
I
saw
the
famous
Pont
du
Garde
;
but
as
I
can
not
possibly
include
,
in
this
letter
,
a
description
of
that
beautiful
bridge
,
and
of
the
other
antiquities
belonging
to
Nismes
,
I
will
defer
it
till
the
next
opportunity
,
being
,
in
the
mean
time
,
with
equal
truth
and
affection
,
 
Dear
Sir
,
Your
obliged
humble
Servant
.
   
<EOS>
MONTPELLIER
,
November
10
,
1763
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
<EOS>
By
the
Pont
<EOS>
St
Esprit
we
entered
the
province
of
Languedoc
,
and
breakfasted
at
Bagniole
,
which
is
a
little
paltry
town
;
from
whence
,
however
,
there
is
an
excellent
road
through
a
mountain
,
made
at
a
great
expence
,
and
extending
about
four
leagues
.
<EOS>
About
five
in
the
afternoon
,
I
had
the
first
glimpse
of
the
famous
Pont
du
Garde
,
which
stands
on
the
right
hand
,
about
the
distance
of
a
league
from
the
post
-
road
to
Nismes
,
and
about
three
leagues
from
that
city
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
willingly
pass
for
a
false
enthusiast
in
taste
;
but
I
can
not
help
observing
,
that
from
the
first
distant
view
of
this
noble
monument
,
till
we
came
near
enough
to
see
it
perfectly
,
I
felt
the
strongest
emotions
of
impatience
that
I
had
ever
known
;
and
obliged
our
driver
to
put
his
mules
to
the
full
gallop
,
in
the
apprehension
that
it
would
be
dark
before
we
reached
the
place
.
<EOS>
I
expected
to
find
the
building
,
in
some
measure
,
ruinous
;
but
was
agreeably
disappointed
,
to
see
it
look
as
fresh
as
the
bridge
at
Westminster
.
<EOS>
The
climate
is
either
so
pure
and
dry
,
or
the
free
-
stone
,
with
which
it
is
built
,
so
hard
,
that
the
very
angles
of
them
remain
as
acute
as
if
they
had
been
cut
last
year
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
some
large
stones
have
dropped
out
of
the
arches
;
but
the
whole
is
admirably
preserved
,
and
presents
the
eye
with
a
piece
of
architecture
,
so
unaffectedly
elegant
,
so
simple
,
and
majestic
,
that
I
will
defy
the
most
phlegmatic
and
stupid
spectator
to
behold
it
without
admiration
.
<EOS>
It
was
raised
in
the
Augustan
age
,
by
the
Roman
colony
of
Nismes
,
to
convey
a
stream
of
water
between
two
mountains
,
for
the
use
of
that
city
.
<EOS>
It
stands
over
the
river
Gardon
,
which
is
a
beautiful
pastoral
stream
,
brawling
among
rocks
,
which
form
a
number
of
pretty
natural
cascades
,
and
overshadowed
on
each
side
with
trees
and
shrubs
,
which
greatly
add
to
the
rural
beauties
of
the
scene
.
<EOS>
It
rises
in
the
Cevennes
,
and
the
sand
of
it
produces
gold
,
as
we
learn
from
Mr
Reaumur
,
in
his
essay
on
this
subject
,
inserted
in
the
French
Memoirs
,
for
the
year
1718
.
<EOS>
If
I
lived
at
Nismes
,
or
Avignon
(
which
last
city
is
within
four
short
leagues
of
it
)
<EOS>
I
should
take
pleasure
in
forming
parties
to
come
hither
,
in
summer
,
to
dine
under
one
of
the
arches
of
the
Pont
du
Garde
,
on
a
cold
collation
.
  
<EOS>
This
work
consists
of
three
bridges
,
or
tire
of
arches
,
one
above
another
;
the
first
of
six
,
the
second
of
eleven
,
and
the
third
of
thirty
-
six
.
<EOS>
The
height
,
comprehending
the
aqueduct
on
the
top
,
amounts
to
174
feet
three
inches
:
the
length
between
the
two
mountains
,
which
it
unites
,
extends
to
723
.
<EOS>
The
order
of
architecture
is
the
Tuscan
,
but
the
symmetry
of
it
is
inconceivable
.
<EOS>
By
scooping
the
bases
of
the
pilasters
,
of
the
second
tire
of
arches
,
they
had
made
a
passage
for
foot
-
travellers
:
but
though
the
antients
far
excelled
us
in
beauty
,
they
certainly
fell
short
of
the
moderns
in
point
of
conveniency
.
<EOS>
The
citizens
of
Avignon
have
,
in
this
particular
,
improved
the
Roman
work
with
a
new
bridge
,
by
apposition
,
constructed
on
the
same
plan
with
that
of
the
lower
tire
of
arches
,
of
which
indeed
it
seems
to
be
a
part
,
affording
a
broad
and
commodious
passage
over
the
river
,
to
horses
and
carriages
of
all
kinds
.
<EOS>
The
aqueduct
,
for
the
continuance
of
which
this
superb
work
was
raised
,
conveyed
a
stream
of
sweet
water
from
the
fountain
of
Eure
,
near
the
city
of
Uzes
,
and
extended
near
six
leagues
in
length
.
  
<EOS>
In
approaching
Nismes
,
you
see
the
ruins
of
a
Roman
tower
,
built
on
the
summit
of
a
hill
,
which
over
-
looks
the
city
.
<EOS>
It
seems
to
have
been
intended
,
at
first
,
as
a
watch
,
or
signal
-
tower
,
though
,
in
the
sequel
,
it
was
used
as
a
fortress
:
what
remains
of
it
,
is
about
ninety
feet
high
;
the
architecture
of
the
Doric
order
.
<EOS>
I
no
sooner
alighted
at
the
inn
,
than
I
was
presented
with
a
pamphlet
,
containing
an
account
of
Nismes
and
its
antiquities
,
which
every
stranger
buys
.
<EOS>
There
are
persons
too
who
attend
in
order
to
shew
the
town
,
and
you
will
always
be
accosted
by
some
shabby
antiquarian
,
who
presents
you
with
medals
for
sale
,
assuring
you
they
are
genuine
antiques
,
and
were
dug
out
of
the
ruins
of
the
Roman
temple
and
baths
.
<EOS>
All
those
fellows
are
cheats
;
and
they
have
often
laid
under
contribution
raw
English
travellers
,
who
had
more
money
than
discretion
.
<EOS>
To
such
they
sell
the
vilest
and
most
common
trash
:
but
when
they
meet
with
a
connoisseur
,
they
produce
some
medals
which
are
really
valuable
and
curious
.
  
<EOS>
Nismes
,
antiently
called
Nemausis
,
was
originally
a
colony
of
Romans
,
settled
by
Augustus
Caesar
,
after
the
battle
of
Actium
.
<EOS>
It
is
still
of
considerable
extent
,
and
said
to
contain
twelve
thousand
families
;
but
the
number
seems
,
by
this
account
,
to
be
greatly
exaggerated
.
<EOS>
Certain
it
is
,
the
city
must
have
been
formerly
very
extensive
,
as
appears
from
the
circuit
of
the
antient
walls
,
the
remains
of
which
are
still
to
be
seen
.
<EOS>
Its
present
size
is
not
one
third
of
its
former
extent
.
<EOS>
Its
temples
,
baths
,
statues
,
towers
,
basilica
,
and
amphitheatre
,
prove
it
to
have
been
a
city
of
great
opulence
and
magnificence
.
<EOS>
At
present
,
the
remains
of
these
antiquities
are
all
that
make
it
respectable
or
remarkable
;
though
here
are
manufactures
of
silk
and
wool
,
carried
on
with
good
success
.
<EOS>
The
water
necessary
for
these
works
is
supplied
by
a
source
at
the
foot
of
the
rock
,
upon
which
the
tower
is
placed
;
and
here
were
discovered
the
ruins
of
Roman
baths
,
which
had
been
formed
and
adorned
with
equal
taste
and
magnificence
.
<EOS>
Among
the
rubbish
they
found
a
vast
profusion
of
columns
,
vases
,
capitals
,
cornices
,
inscriptions
,
medals
,
statues
,
and
among
other
things
,
the
finger
of
a
colossal
statue
in
bronze
,
which
,
according
to
the
rules
of
proportion
,
must
have
been
fifteen
feet
high
.
<EOS>
From
these
particulars
,
it
appears
that
the
edifices
must
have
been
spacious
and
magnificent
.
<EOS>
Part
of
a
tesselated
pavement
still
remains
.
<EOS>
The
antient
pavement
of
the
bath
is
still
intire
;
all
the
rubbish
has
been
cleared
away
;
and
the
baths
,
in
a
great
measure
,
restored
on
the
old
plan
,
though
they
are
not
at
present
used
for
any
thing
but
ornament
.
<EOS>
The
water
is
collected
into
two
vast
reservoirs
,
and
a
canal
built
and
lined
with
hewn
stone
.
<EOS>
There
are
three
handsome
bridges
thrown
over
this
vast
canal
.
<EOS>
It
contains
a
great
body
of
excellent
water
,
which
by
pipes
and
other
small
branching
canals
,
traverses
the
town
,
and
is
converted
to
many
different
purposes
of
oeconomy
and
manufacture
.
<EOS>
Between
the
Roman
bath
and
these
great
canals
,
the
ground
is
agreeably
laid
out
in
pleasure
-
walks
.
<EOS>
for
the
recreation
of
the
inhabitants
.
<EOS>
Here
are
likewise
ornaments
of
architecture
,
which
savour
much
more
of
French
foppery
,
than
of
the
simplicity
and
greatness
of
the
antients
.
<EOS>
It
is
very
surprizing
,
that
this
fountain
should
produce
such
a
great
body
of
water
,
as
fills
the
basin
of
the
source
,
the
Roman
basin
,
two
large
deep
canals
three
hundred
feet
in
length
,
two
vast
basins
that
make
part
of
the
great
canal
,
which
is
eighteen
hundred
feet
long
.
<EOS>
eighteen
feet
deep
,
and
forty
-
eight
feet
broad
.
<EOS>
When
I
saw
it
,
there
was
in
it
about
eight
or
nine
feet
of
water
,
transparent
as
crystal
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
observed
,
however
,
for
the
honour
of
French
cleanliness
,
that
in
the
Roman
basin
,
through
which
this
noble
stream
of
water
passes
,
I
perceived
two
washerwomen
at
work
upon
children
's
clouts
and
dirty
linnen
.
<EOS>
Surprized
,
and
much
disgusted
at
this
filthy
phaenomenon
<EOS>
,
I
asked
by
what
means
,
and
by
whose
permission
,
those
dirty
hags
had
got
down
into
the
basin
,
in
order
to
contaminate
the
water
at
its
fountain
-
head
;
and
understood
they
belonged
to
the
commandant
of
the
place
,
who
had
keys
of
the
subterranean
passage
.
  
<EOS>
Fronting
the
Roman
baths
are
the
ruins
of
an
antient
temple
,
which
,
according
to
tradition
,
was
dedicated
to
Diana
:
but
it
has
been
observed
by
connoisseurs
,
that
all
the
antient
temples
of
this
goddess
were
of
the
Ionic
order
;
whereas
,
this
is
partly
Corinthian
,
and
partly
composite
.
<EOS>
It
is
about
seventy
foot
long
,
and
six
and
thirty
in
breadth
,
arched
above
,
and
built
of
large
blocks
of
stone
,
exactly
joined
together
without
any
cement
.
<EOS>
The
walls
are
still
standing
,
with
three
great
tabernacles
at
the
further
end
,
fronting
the
entrance
.
<EOS>
On
each
side
,
there
are
niches
in
the
intercolumniation
of
the
walls
,
together
with
pedestals
and
shafts
of
pillars
,
cornices
,
and
an
entablature
,
which
indicate
the
former
magnificence
of
the
building
.
<EOS>
It
was
destroyed
during
the
civil
war
that
raged
in
the
reign
of
Henry
III
of
France
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
amazing
,
that
the
successive
irruptions
of
barbarous
nations
,
of
Goths
,
Vandals
,
and
Moors
;
of
fanatic
croisards
,
still
more
sanguinary
and
illiberal
than
those
Barbarians
,
should
have
spared
this
temple
,
as
well
as
two
other
still
more
noble
monuments
of
architecture
,
that
to
this
day
adorn
the
city
of
Nismes
:
<EOS>
I
mean
the
amphitheatre
and
the
edifice
,
called
Maison
Carree
 
<EOS>
The
former
of
these
is
counted
the
finest
monument
of
the
kind
,
now
extant
;
and
was
built
in
the
reign
of
Antoninus
Pius
,
who
contributed
a
large
sum
of
money
towards
its
erection
.
<EOS>
It
is
of
an
oval
figure
,
one
thousand
and
eighty
feet
in
circumference
,
capacious
enough
to
hold
twenty
thousand
spectators
.
<EOS>
The
architecture
is
of
the
Tuscan
order
,
sixty
feet
high
,
composed
of
two
open
galleries
,
built
one
over
another
,
consisting
each
of
threescore
arcades
.
<EOS>
The
entrance
into
the
arena
was
by
four
great
gates
,
with
porticos
;
and
the
seats
,
of
which
there
were
thirty
,
rising
one
above
another
,
consisted
of
great
blocks
of
stone
,
many
of
which
still
remain
.
<EOS>
Over
the
north
gate
,
appear
two
bulls
,
in
alto
-
relievo
,
extremely
well
executed
,
emblems
which
,
according
to
the
custom
of
the
Romans
,
signified
that
the
amphitheatre
was
erected
at
the
expence
of
the
people
.
<EOS>
There
are
in
other
parts
of
it
some
work
in
bas
-
relief
,
and
heads
or
busts
but
indifferently
carved
.
<EOS>
It
stands
in
the
lower
part
of
the
town
,
and
strikes
the
spectator
with
awe
and
veneration
.
<EOS>
The
external
architecture
is
almost
intire
in
its
whole
circuit
;
but
the
arena
is
filled
up
with
houses
 
<EOS>
This
amphitheatre
was
fortified
as
a
citadel
by
the
Visigoths
,
in
the
beginning
of
the
sixth
century
.
<EOS>
They
raised
within
it
a
castle
,
two
towers
of
which
are
still
extant
;
and
they
surrounded
it
with
a
broad
and
deep
fossee
,
which
was
filled
up
in
the
thirteenth
century
.
<EOS>
In
all
the
subsequent
wars
to
which
this
city
was
exposed
,
it
served
as
the
last
resort
of
the
citizens
,
and
sustained
a
great
number
of
successive
attacks
;
so
that
its
preservation
is
almost
miraculous
.
<EOS>
It
is
likely
,
however
,
to
suffer
much
more
from
the
Gothic
avarice
of
its
own
citizens
,
some
of
whom
are
mutilating
it
every
day
,
for
the
sake
of
the
stones
,
which
they
employ
in
their
own
private
buildings
.
<EOS>
It
is
surprizing
,
that
the
King
's
authority
has
not
been
exerted
to
put
an
end
to
such
sacrilegious
violation
.
  
<EOS>
If
the
amphitheatre
strikes
you
with
an
idea
of
greatness
,
the
Maison
Carree
enchants
you
with
the
most
exquisite
beauties
of
architecture
and
sculpture
.
<EOS>
This
is
an
edifice
,
supposed
formerly
to
have
been
erected
by
Adrian
,
who
actually
built
a
basilica
in
this
city
,
though
no
vestiges
of
it
remain
:
but
the
following
inscription
,
which
was
discovered
on
the
front
of
it
,
plainly
proves
,
that
it
was
built
by
the
inhabitants
of
Nismes
,
in
honour
of
Caius
and
Lucius
Caesar
,
the
grandchildren
of
Augustus
by
his
daughter
Julia
,
the
wife
of
Agrippa
.

This
beautiful
edifice
,
which
stands
upon
a
pediment
six
feet
high
,
is
eighty
-
two
feet
long
,
thirty
-
five
broad
,
and
thirty
-
seven
high
,
without

the

<EOS>
The
body
of
it
is
adorned
with
twenty
columns
engaged
in
the
wall
,
and
the
peristyle
,
which
is
open
,
with
ten
detached
pillars
that
support
the
entablature

<EOS>
They
are
all
of
the
Corinthian
order
,
fluted
and
embellished
with
capitals
of
the
most
exquisite
sculpture
,
the
frize
and
cornice
are
much
admired
,
and
the

is
esteemed
inimitable
.
<EOS>
The
proportions
of
the
building
are
so
happily
united
,
as
to
give
it
an
air
of
majesty
and
grandeur
,
which
the
most
indifferent
spectator
can
not
behold
without
emotion

<EOS>
A

needs
not

a
connoisseur
in
architecture

to
enjoy
these
beauties
.
<EOS>
They
are
indeed
so
exquisite
that
you
may
return
to
them
every
day
with
a
fresh
appetite
for
seven
years
together
.
<EOS>
What
renders
them
the
more
curious

they
are
still
entire

very
little
affected

either
by
the

Cardinal
Alberoni
declared

An
Italian
painter
,
perceiving
a

repaired

modern
French
masonry

tore
his

in

Without
all

it

ravishingly
beautiful
.

The

can
not

am

entire

like

The
history
of
the
antiquities
of
Nismes
takes
notice
of
a
grotesque
statue
,
representing
two
female
bodies
and
legs
,
united
under
the
head
of
an
old
man
;
but
,
as
it
does
not
inform
us
where
it
is
kept
,
I
did
not
see
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
whole
country
of
Languedoc
is
shaded
with
olive
trees
,
the
fruit
of
which
begins
to
ripen
,
and
appears
as
black
as
sloes
;
those
they
pickle
are
pulled
green
,
and
steeped
for
some
time
in
a
lye
made
of
quick
lime
or
wood
ashes
,
which
extracts
the
bitter
taste
,
and
makes
the
fruit
tender
.
<EOS>
Without
this
preparation
it
is
not
eatable
.
<EOS>
Under
the
olive
and
fig
trees
,
they
plant
corn
and
vines
,
so
that
there
is
not
an
inch
of
ground
unlaboured
:
but
here
are
no
open
fields
,
meadows
,
or
cattle
to
be
seen
.
<EOS>
The
ground
is
overloaded
;
and
the
produce
of
it
crowded
to
such
a
degree
,
as
to
have
a
bad
effect
upon
the
eye
,
impressing
the
traveller
with
the
ideas
of
indigence
and
rapacity
.
<EOS>
The
heat
in
summer
is
so
excessive
,
that
cattle
would
find
no
green
forage
,
every
blade
of
grass
being
parched
up
and
destroyed
.
<EOS>
The
weather
was
extremely
hot
when
we
entered
Montpellier
,
and
put
up
at
the
Cheval
Blanc
,
counted
the
best
auberge
in
the
place
,
tho
'
in
fact
it
is
a
most
wretched
hovel
,
the
habitation
of
darkness
,
dirt
,
and
imposition
.
<EOS>
Here
I
was
obliged
to
pay
four
livres
a
meal
for
every
person
in
my
family
,
and
two
livres
at
night
for
every
bed
,
though
all
in
the
same
room
:
one
would
imagine
that
the
further
we
advance
to
the
southward
<EOS>
the
living
is
the
dearer
,
though
in
fact
every
article
of
housekeeping
is
cheaper
in
Languedoc
than
many
other
provinces
of
France
.
<EOS>
This
imposition
is
owing
to
the
concourse
of
English
who
come
hither
,
and
,
like
simple
birds
of
passage
,
allow
themselves
to
be
plucked
by
the
people
of
the
country
,
who
know
their
weak
side
,
and
make
their
attacks
accordingly
.
<EOS>
They
affect
to
believe
,
that
all
the
travellers
of
our
country
are
grand
seigneurs
,
immensely
rich
and
incredibly
generous
;
and
we
are
silly
enough
to
encourage
this
opinion
,
by
submitting
quietly
to
the
most
ridiculous
extortion
,
as
well
as
by
committing
acts
of
the
most
absurd
extravagance
.
<EOS>
This
folly
of
the
English
,
together
with
a
concourse
of
people
from
different
quarters
,
who
come
hither
for
the
re
-
establishment
of
their
health
,
has
rendered
Montpellier
one
of
the
dearest
places
in
the
South
of
France
.
<EOS>
The
city
,
which
is
but
small
,
stands
upon
a
rising
ground
fronting
the
Mediterranean
,
which
is
about
three
leagues
to
the
southward
:
on
the
other
side
is
an
agreeable
plain
,
extending
about
the
same
distance
towards
the
mountains
of
the
Cevennes
.
<EOS>
The
town
is
reckoned
well
built
,
and
what
the
French
call
bien
percee
;
yet
the
streets
are
in
general
narrow
,
and
the
houses
dark
.
<EOS>
The
air
is
counted
salutary
in
catarrhous
consumptions
,
from
its
dryness
and
elasticity
:
but
too
sharp
in
cases
of
pulmonary
imposthumes
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
at
Montpellier
that
we
saw
for
the
first
time
any
signs
of
that
gaiety
and
mirth
for
which
the
people
of
this
country
are
celebrated
.
<EOS>
In
all
other
places
through
which
we
passed
since
our
departure
from
Lyons
,
we
saw
nothing
but
marks
of
poverty
and
chagrin
.
<EOS>
We
entered
Montpellier
on
a
Sunday
,
when
the
people
were
all
dressed
in
their
best
apparel
.
<EOS>
The
streets
were
crowded
;
and
a
great
number
of
the
better
sort
of
both
sexes
sat
upon
stone
seats
at
their
doors
,
conversing
with
great
mirth
and
familiarity
.
<EOS>
These
conversations
lasted
the
greatest
part
of
the
night
;
and
many
of
them
were
improved
with
musick
both
vocal
and
instrumental
:
next
day
we
were
visited
by
the
English
residing
in
the
place
,
who
always
pay
this
mark
of
respect
to
new
comers
.
<EOS>
They
consist
of
four
or
five
families
,
among
whom
I
could
pass
the
winter
very
agreeably
,
if
the
state
of
my
health
and
other
reasons
did
not
call
me
away
.

Mr

arrived
two

troubled
with
the
same
asthmatic
disorder
,
under
which
I
have
laboured
so
long
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
he
had
been
in
quest
of
me
ever
since
he
left
England
.
<EOS>
Upon
comparing
notes
,
I
found
he
had
stopped
at
the
door
of
a
country
inn
in
Picardy
,
and
drank
a
glass
of
wine
and
water
,
while
I
was
at
dinner
up
stairs
;
nay
,
he
had
even
spoke
to
my
servant
,
and
asked
who
was
his
master
,
and
the
man
,
not
knowing
him
,
replied
,
he
was
a
gentleman
from
Chelsea
.
<EOS>
He
had
walked
by
the
door
of
the
house
where
I
lodged
at
Paris
,
twenty
times
,
while
I
was
in
that
city
;
and
the
very
day
before
he
arrived
at
Montpellier
,
he
had
passed
our
coach
on
the
road
.
  
<EOS>
The
garrison
of
this
city
consists
of
two
battalions
,
one
of
which
is
the
Irish
regiment
of
Berwick
,
commanded
by
lieutenant
colonel
Tents
,
a
gentleman
with
whom
we
contracted
an
acquaintance
at
Boulogne
.
<EOS>
He
treats
us
with
great
politeness
,
and
indeed
does
every
thing
in
his
power
to
make
the
place
agreeable
to
us
.
<EOS>
The
duke
of
Fitz
-
James
,
the
governor
,
is
expected
here
in
a
little
time
.
<EOS>
We
have
already
a
tolerable
concert
twice
a
week
;
there
will
be
a
comedy
in
the
winter
;
and
the
states
of
Provence
assemble
in
January
,
so
that
Montpellier
will
be
extremely
gay
and
brilliant
.
<EOS>
These
very
circumstances
would
determine
me
to
leave
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
health
to
enjoy
these
pleasures
<EOS>
:
I
can
not
bear
a
croud
of
company
such
as
pours
in
upon
us
unexpectedly
at
all
hours
;
and
I
foresee
,
that
in
staying
at
Montpellier
,
I
should
be
led
into
an
expence
,
which
I
can
ill
afford
.
<EOS>
I
have
therefore
forwarded
the
letter
I
received
from
general
P
 
n
,
to
Mr
B
 
d
,
our
consul
at
Nice
,
signifying
my
intention
of
going
thither
,
and
explaining
the
kind
of
accommodation
I
would
choose
to
have
at
that
place
.
  
<EOS>
The
day
after
our
arrival
,
I
procured
tolerable
lodgings
in
the
High
Street
,
for
which
I
pay
fifty
sols
,
something
more
than
two
shillings
per
day
;
and
I
am
furnished
with
two
meals
a
day
by
a
traiteur
for
ten
livres
:
but
he
finds
neither
the
wine
nor
the
dessert
;
and
indeed
we
are
but
indifferently
served
.
<EOS>
Those
families
who
reside
here
find
their
account
in
keeping
house
.
<EOS>
Every
traveller
who
comes
to
this
,
or
any
other
,
town
in
France
with
a
design
to
stay
longer
than
a
day
or
two
,
ought
to
write
beforehand
to
his
correspondent
to
procure
furnished
lodgings
,
to
which
he
may
be
driven
immediately
,
without
being
under
the
necessity
of
lying
in
an
execrable
inn
;
for
all
the
inns
of
this
country
are
execrable
.
  
<EOS>
My
baggage
is
not
yet
arrived
by
the
canal
of
Languedoc
;
but
that
gives
me
no
disturbance
,
as
it
is
consigned
to
the
care
of
Mr
Ray
,
an
English
merchant
and
banker
of
this
place
;
a
gentleman
of
great
probity
and
worth
,
from
whom
I
have
received
repeated
marks
of
uncommon
friendship
and
hospitality
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
time
you
hear
of
me
will

Dear

<EOS>
MONTPELLIER
,
November
12
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
DOCTOR
 
<EOS>
I
flattered
myself
with
the
hope
of
much
amusement
during
my
short
stay
at
Montpellier
.
 
<EOS>
The
University
,
the
Botanical
Garden
,
the
State
of
Physic
in
this
part
of
the
world
,
and
the
information
I
received
of
a
curious
collection
of
manuscripts
,
among
which
I
hoped
to
find
something
for
our
friend
Dr
H
 
r
;
all
these
particulars
promised
a
rich
fund
of
entertainment
,
which
,
however
,
I
can
not
enjoy
.
  
<EOS>
A
few
days
after
my
arrival
,
it
began
to
rain
with
a
southerly
wind
,
and
continued
without
ceasing
the
best
part
of
a
week
,
leaving
the
air
so
loaded
with
vapours
,
that
there
was
no
walking
after
sun
-
set
;
without
being
wetted
by
the
dew
almost
to
the
skin
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
found
a
cold
and
damp
atmosphere
the
most
unfavourable
of
any
to
my
constitution
.
<EOS>
My
asthmatical
disorder
.
<EOS>
which
had
not
given
me
much
disturbance
since
I
left
Boulogne
,
became
now
very
troublesome
,
attended
with
fever
,
cough
spitting
,
and
lowness
of
spirits
;
and
I
wasted
visibly
every
day
.
<EOS>
I
was
favoured
with
the
advice
of
Dr
Fitzmaurice
,
a
very
worthy
sensible
physician
settled
in
this
place
:
but
I
had
the
curiosity
to
know
the
opinion
of
the
celebrated
professor
F
 
,
who
is
the
Boerhaave
of
Montpellier
.
<EOS>
The
account
I
had
of
his
private
character
and
personal
deportment
,
from
some
English
people
to
whom
he
was
well
known
,
left
me
no
desire
to
converse
with
him
:
but
I
resolved
to
consult
with
him
on
paper
.
<EOS>
This
great
lanthorn
of
medicine
is
become
very
rich
and
very
insolent
;
and
in
proportion
as
his
wealth
increases
,
he
is
said
to
grow
the
more
rapacious
.
<EOS>
He
piques
himself
upon
being
very
slovenly
,
very
blunt
,
and
very
unmannerly
;
and
perhaps
to
these
qualifications
be
owes
his
reputation
rather
than
to
any
superior
skill
in
medicine
.
<EOS>
I
have
known
them
succeed
in
our
own
country
;
and
seen
a
doctor
's
parts
estimated
by
his
brutality
and
presumption
.
  
<EOS>
F
  
is
in
his
person
and
address
not
unlike
our
old
acquaintance
<EOS>
Dr
Sm
 
<EOS>
ie
;
he
stoops
much
,
dodges
along
,
and
affects
to
speak
the
Patois
,
which
is
a
corruption
of
the
old
Provencial
tongue
,
spoken
by
the
vulgar
in
Languedoc
and
Provence
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
his
great
age
and
great
wealth
,
he
will
still
scramble
up
two
pair
of
stairs
for
a
fee
of
six
livres
;
and
without
a
fee
he
will
give
his
advice
to
no
person
whatsoever
.
  
<EOS>
He
is
said
to
have
great
practice
in
the
venereal
branch
and
to
be
frequented
by
persons
of
both
sexes
infected
with
this
distemper
,
not
only
from
every
part
of
France
,
but
also
from
Spain
,
Italy
,
Germany
,
and
England
.
<EOS>
I
need
say
nothing
of
the
Montpellier
method
of
cure
,
which
is
well
known
at
London
;
but
I
have
some
reason
to
think
the
great
professor
F
 
,
<EOS>
has
,
like
the
famous
Mrs
Mapp
,
the
bone
-
setter
,
cured
many
patients
that
were
never
diseased
.
  
<EOS>
Be
that
as
it
may
,
I
sent
my
valet
de
place
,
who
was
his
townsman
and
acquaintance
,
to
his
house
,
with
the

I
thought
it
was
a
little
extraordinary
that
a
learned
professor
should
reply
in
his
mother
tongue
,
to
a
case
put
in
Latin
:
but
I
was
much
more
surprised
,
as
you
will
also
be
,
at
reading
his
answer
,
from
which
I
was
obliged
to
conclude
,
either
that
he
did
not
understand
Latin
;
or
that
he
had
not
taken
the
trouble
to
read
my
memoire
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
make
any
remarks
upon
the
stile
of
his
prescription
,
replete
as
it
is
with
a
disgusting
repetition
of
low
expressions
:
but
I
could
not
but
,
in
justice
to
myself
,
point
out
to
him
the
passages
in
my
case
which
he
had
overlooked

<EOS>
Considering
the
nature
of
the
case
,
you
see
I
could
not
treat
him
more
civilly
.
<EOS>
I
desired
the
servant
to
ask
when
he
should
return
for
an
answer
,
and
whether
he
expected
another
fee
.
<EOS>
He
desired
him
to
come
next
morning
,
and
,
as
the
fellow
assured
me
,
gave
him
to
understand
,
that
whatever
monsieur
might
solicit
,
should
be
for
his
(
the
servant
's
)
advantage
.
<EOS>
In
all
probability
he
did
not
expect
another
gratification
,
to
which
,
indeed
,
he
had
no
title
.
<EOS>
Mons
.
<EOS>
F
  
<EOS>
was
undoubtedly
much
mortified
to
find
himself
detected
in
such
flagrant
instances
of
unjustifiable
negligence
,
arid
like
all
other
persons
in
the
same
ungracious
dilemma
,
instead
of
justifying
himself
by
reason
or
argument
,
had
recourse
to
recrimination
.
<EOS>
In
the
paper
which
he
sent
me
next
day
,
he
insisted
in
general
that
he
had
carefully
perused
the
case
(
which
you
will
perceive
was
a
self
-
evident
untruth
)
;
he
said
the
theory
it
contained
was
idle
;
that
he
was
sure
it
could
not
be
written
by
a
physician
;
that
,
with
respect
to
the
disorder
,
he
was
still
of
the
same
opinion
;
and
adhered
to
his
former
prescription
;
but
if
I
had
any
doubts
I
might
come
to
his
house
,
and
he
would
resolve
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
wrapt
up
twelve
livres
in
the
following
note
,
and
sent
it
to
his
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
C'est

is
not
without

large

have
no

remaining

Heaven
and

To
this
I
received
for
answer
.

Sir

Fizes

&
c.
"
  
Instead
of
keeping
his
promise
to
the
valet
,
he
put
the
money
in
his
pocket
;
and
the
fellow
returned
in
a
rage
,
exclaiming
that
he
was
un
gros
cheval
de
carosse
,
a
great
coach
-
horse
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
make
no
other
comment
upon
the
medicines
,
and
the
regimen
which
this
great
Doctor
prescribed
;
but
that
he
certainly
mistook
the
case
:
that
upon
the
supposition
I
actually
laboured
under
a
purulent
discharge
from
the
lungs
,
his
remedies
savour
strongly
of
the
old
woman
;
and
that
there
is
a
total
blank
with
respect
to
the
article
of
exercise
,
which
you
know
is
so
essential
in
all
pulmonary
disorders
.
<EOS>
But
after
having
perused
my
remarks
upon
his
first
prescription
,
he
could
not
possibly
suppose
that
I
had
tubercules
,
and
was
spitting
up
pus
;
therefore
his
persisting
in
recommending
the
same
medicines
he
had
prescribed
on
that
supposition
,
was
a
flagrant
absurdity
.
 
<EOS>
If
,
for
example
,
there
was
no
vomica
in
the
lungs
;
and
the
business
was
to
attenuate
the
lymph
,
what
could
be
more
preposterous
than
to
advise
the
chalk
of
Briancon
,
coral
,
antihecticum
poterii
,
and
the
balm
of
Canada
?
<EOS>
As
for
the
turtle
-
soupe
,
it
is
a
good
restorative
and
balsamic
;
but
,
I
apprehend
,
will
tend
to
thicken
rather
than
attenuate
the
phlegm
.
<EOS>
He
mentions
not
a
syllable
of
the
air
,
though
it
is
universally
allowed
,
that
the
climate
of
Montpellier
is
pernicious
to
ulcerated
lungs
;
and
here
I
can
not
help
recounting
a
small
adventure
which
our
doctor
had
with
a
son
of
Mr
O
 
d
,
merchant
in
the
city
of
London
.
<EOS>
I
had
it
from
Mrs
St
 
e
who
was
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
The
young
gentleman
,
being
consumptive
,
consulted
Mr
F
 
,
who
continued
visiting
and
prescribing
for
him
a
whole
month
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
perceiving
that
he
grew
daily
worse
,
"
Doctor
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
I
take
your
prescriptions
punctually
;
but
,
instead
of
being
the
better
for
them
,
I
have
now
not
an
hour
's
remission
from
the
fever
in
the
four
-
and
-
twenty
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
conceive
the
meaning
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
F
 
,
who
perceived
he
had
not
long
to
live
,
told
him
the
reason
was
very
plain
:
the
air
of
Montpellier
was
too
sharp
for
his
lungs
,
which
required
a
softer
climate
.
<EOS>
"
Then
you
're
a
sordid
villain
(
cried
the
young
man
)
for
allowing
me
to
stay
here
till
my
constitution
is
irretrievable
.
"
<EOS>
He
set
out
immediately
for
Tholouse
,
and
in
a
few
weeks
died
in
the
neighbourhood
of
that
city
.
  
<EOS>
I
observe
that
the
physicians
in
this
country
pay
no
regard
to
the
state
of
the
solids
in
chronical
disorders
,
<EOS>
that
exercise
and
the
cold
bath
are
never
prescribed
,
that
they
seem
to
think
the
scurvy
is
entirely
an
English
disease
;
and
that
,
in
all
appearance
,
they
often
confound
the
symptoms
of
it
,
with
those
of
the
venereal
distemper
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
may
be
more
particular
on
this
subject
in
a
subsequent
letter
.
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
I
am
ever

Dear
Sir

Yours

still

,
called

Here
is
a
good
equestrian
statue
of
Louis
XIV
,
fronting
one
gate
of
the
city
,
which
is
built
in
form
of
a
triumphal
arch
,
in
honour
of
the
same
monarch
.
<EOS>
Immediately
under
the
pierou
is
the
physic
garden
,
and
near
it
an
arcade
just
finished
for
an
aqueduct
,
to
convey
a
stream
of
water
to
the
upper
parts
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
should
have
thought
this
a
neat
piece
of
work
,
if
I
had
not
seen
the
Pont
du
Garde
:
but
,
after
having
viewed
the
Roman
arches
,
I
could
not
look
upon
this
but
with
pity
and
contempt
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
wonder
how
the
architect
could
be
so
fantastically
modern
,
having
such
a
noble
model
,
as
it
were
,
before
his
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
There
are
many
protestants
at
this
place
,
as
well
as
at
Nismes
,
and
they
are
no
longer
molested
on
the
score
of
religion
.
<EOS>
They
have
their
conventicles
in
the
country
,
where
they
assemble
privately
for
worship
.
<EOS>
These
are
well
known
;
and
detachments
are
sent
out
every
Sunday
to
intercept
them
;
but
the
officer
has
always
private
directions
to
take
another
route
.
<EOS>
Whether
this
indulgence
comes
from
the
wisdom
and
lenity
of
the
government
,
or
is
purchased
with
money
of
the
commanding
officer
,
I
can
not
determine
:
but
certain
it
is
,
the
laws
of
France
punish
capitally
every
protestant
minister
convicted
of
having
performed
the
functions
of
his
ministry
in
this
kingdom
;
and
one
was
hanged
about
two
years
ago
,
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Montauban
.
  
<EOS>
The
markets
in
Montpellier
are
well
supplied
with
fish
,
poultry
,
butcher
's
meat
,
and
game
,
at
reasonable
rates
.
<EOS>
The
wine
of
the
country
is
strong
and
harsh
,
and
never
drank
,
but
when
mixed
with
water
.
<EOS>
Burgundy
is
dear
,
and
so
is
the
sweet
wine
of
Frontignan
,
though
made
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Cette
.
<EOS>
You
know
it
is
famous
all
over
Europe
,
and
so
are
the
liqueurs
,
or
drams
of
various
sorts
,
compounded
and
distilled
at
Montpellier
.
<EOS>
Cette
is
the
sea
-
port
,
about
four
leagues
from
that
city
:
but
the
canal
of
Languedoc
comes
up
within
a
mile
of
it
;
and
is
indeed
a
great
curiosity
:
a
work
in
all
respects
worthy
of
a
Colbert
,
under
whose
auspices
it
was
finished
.
<EOS>
When
I
find
such
a
general
tribute
of
respect
and
veneration
paid
to
the
memory
of
that
great
man
,
I
am
astonished
to
see
so
few
monuments
of
public
utility
left
by
other
ministers
.
<EOS>
One
would
imagine
,
that
even
the
desire
of
praise
would
prompt
a
much
greater
number
to
exert
themselves
for
the
glory
and
advantage
of
their
country
;
yet
in
my
opinion
,
the
French
have
been
ungrateful
to
Colbert
,
in
the
same
proportion
as
they
have
over
-
rated
the
character
of
his
master
.
<EOS>
Through
all
France
one
meets
with
statues
and
triumphal
arches
erected
to
Louis
XIV
,
in
consequence
of
his
victories
;
by
which
,
likewise
,
he
acquired
the
title
of
Louis
le
Grand
.
<EOS>
But
how
were
those
victories
obtained
?
<EOS>
Not
by
any
personal
merit
of
Louis
.
<EOS>
It
was
Colbert
who
improved
his
finances
,
and
enabled
him
to
pay
his
army
.
<EOS>
It
was
Louvois
that
provided
all
the
necessaries
of
war
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
Conde
,
a
Turenne
,
a
Luxemburg
,
a
Vendome
,
who
fought
his
battles
;
and
<EOS>
his
first
conquests
,
for
which
he
was
deified
by
the
pen
of
adulation
,
were
obtained
almost
without
bloodshed
,
over
weak
,
dispirited
,
divided
,
and
defenceless
nations
.
<EOS>
It
was
Colbert
that
improved
the
marine
,
instituted
manufactures
,
encouraged
commerce
,
undertook
works
of
public
utility
,
and
patronized
the
arts
and
sciences
.
<EOS>
But
Louis
(
you
will
say
)
had
the
merit
of
choosing
and
supporting
those
ministers
,
and
those
generals
.
<EOS>
I
answer
,
no
.
<EOS>
He
found
Colbert
and
Louvois
already
chosen
:
he
found
Conde
and
Turenne
in
the
very
zenith
of
military
reputation
.
<EOS>
Luxemburg
was
Conde
's
pupil
;
and
Vendome
,
a
prince
of
the
blood
,
who
at
first
obtained
the
command
of
armies
in
consequence
of
his
high
birth
,
and
happened
to
turn
out
a
man
of
genius
.
<EOS>
The
same
Louis
had
the
sagacity
to
revoke
the
edict
of
Nantz
;
to
entrust
his
armies
to
a
Tallard
,
a
Villeroy
,
and
a
Marsin
.
<EOS>
He
had
the
humanity
to
ravage
the
country
,
burn
the
towns
,
and
massacre
the
people
of
the
Palatinate
.
<EOS>
He
had
the
patriotism
to
impoverish
and
depopulate
his
own
kingdom
,
in
order
to
prosecute
schemes
of
the
most
lawless
ambition
.
<EOS>
He
had
the
Consolation
to
beg
a
peace
from
those
he
had
provoked
to
war
by
the
most
outrageous
insolence
;
and
he
had
the
glory
to
espouse
Mrs
Maintenon
in
her
old
age
,
the
widow
of
the
buffoon
Scarron
.
<EOS>
Without
all
doubt
,
it
was
from
irony
he
acquired
the
title
le
Grand
.
  
<EOS>
Having
received
a
favourable
answer
from
Mr
B
 
,
the
English
consul
at
Nice
,
and
recommended
the
care
of
my
heavy
baggage
to
Mr
Ray
,
who
undertook
to
send
it
by
sea
from
Cette
to
Villefranche
,
I
hired
a
coach
and
mules
for
seven
loui'dores
,
and
set
out
from
Montpellier
on
the
13th
of
November
,
the
weather
being
agreeable
,
though
the
air
was
cold
and
frosty
.
<EOS>
In
other
respects
there
were
no
signs
of
winter
:
the
olives
were
now
ripe
,
and
appeared
on
each
side
of
the
road
as
black
as
sloes
;
and
the
corn
was
already
half
a
foot
high
.
<EOS>
On
the
second
day
of
our
journey
,
we
passed
the
Rhone
on
a
bridge
of
boats
at
Buccaire
,
and
lay
on
the
other
side
at
Tarrascone
.
<EOS>
Next
day
we
put
up
at
a
wretched
place
called
Orgon
,
where
,
however
,
we
were
regaled
with
an
excellent
supper
;
and
among
other
delicacies
,
with
a
dish
of
green
pease
.
<EOS>
Provence
is
a
pleasant
country
,
well
cultivated
;
but
the
inns
are
not
so
good
here
as
in
Languedoc
,
and
few
of
them
are
provided
with
a
certain
convenience
which
an
English
traveller
can
very
ill
dispense
with
.
<EOS>
Those
you
find
are
generally
on
the
tops
of
houses
,
exceedingly
nasty
;
and
so
much
exposed
to
the
weather
,
that
a
valetudinarian
can
not
use
them
without
hazard
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
At
Nismes
in
Languedoc
,
where
we
found
the
Temple
of
Cloacina
in
a
most
shocking
condition
,
the
servant
-
maid
told
me
her
mistress
had
caused
it
to
be
made
on
purpose
for
the
English
travellers
;
but
now
she
was
very
sorry
for
what
she
had
done
,
as
all
the
French
who
frequented
her
house
,
instead
of
using
the
seat
,
left
their
offerings
on
the
floor
,
which
she
was
obliged
to
have
cleaned
three
or
four
times
a
day
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
degree
of
beastliness
,
which
would
appear
detestable
even
in
the
capital
of
North
-
Britain
.
<EOS>
On
the
fourth
day
of
our
pilgrimage
,
we
lay
in
the
suburbs
of
Aix
,
but
did
not
enter
the
city
,
which
I
had
a
great
curiosity
to
see
.
<EOS>
The
villainous
asthma
baulked
me
of
that
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
I
was
pinched
with
the
cold
,
and
impatient
to
reach
a
warmer
climate
.
<EOS>
Our
next
stage
was
at
a
paltry
village
,
where
we
were
poorly
entertained
.
<EOS>
I
looked
so
ill
in
the
morning
,
that
the
good
woman
of
the
house
,
who
was
big
with
child
,
took
me
by
the
hand
at
parting
,
and
even
shed
tears
,
praying
fervently
that
God
would
restore
me
to
my
health
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
only
instance
of
sympathy
,
compassion
,
or
goodness
of
heart
,
that
I
had
met
with
among
the
publicans
of
France
.
<EOS>
Indeed
at
Valencia
,
our
landlady
,
understanding
I
was
travelling
to
Montpellier
for
my
health
would
have
dissuaded
me
from
going
thither
;
and
exhorted
me
,
in
particular
,
to
beware
of
the
physicians
,
who
were
all
a
pack
of
assassins
.
<EOS>
She
advised
me
to
eat
fricassees
of
chickens
,
and
white
meat
,
and
to
take
a
good
bouillon
every
morning
.
  
<EOS>
A
bouillon
is
an
universal
remedy
among
the
good
people
of
France
;
insomuch
,
that
they
have
no
idea
of
any
person
's
dying
,
after
having
swallowed
un
bon
bouillon
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
English
gentlemen
,
who
were
robbed
and
murdered
about
thirty
years
ago
between
Calais
and
Boulogne
,
being
brought
to
the
post
-
house
of
Boulogne
with
some
signs
of
life
,
this
remedy
was
immediately
administered
.
<EOS>
"
What
surprises
me
greatly
,
(
said
the
post
-
master
,
speaking
of
this
melancholy
story
to
a
friend
of
mine
,
two
years
after
it
happened
)
<EOS>
I
made
an
excellent
bouillon
,
and
poured
it
down
his
throat
with
my
own
hands
,
and
yet
he
did
not
recover
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Now
,
in
all
probability
,
this
bouillon
it
was
that
stopped
his
breath
.
<EOS>
When
I
was
a
very
young
man
,
I
remember
to
have
seen
a
person
suffocated
by
such
impertinent
officiousness
.
<EOS>
A
young
man
of
uncommon
parts
and
erudition
,
very
well
esteemed
at
the
university
of
G
 
<EOS>
ow
was
found
early
one
morning
in
a
subterranean
vault
among
the
ruins
of
an
old
archiepiscopal
palace
,
with
his
throat
cut
from
ear
to
ear
.
<EOS>
Being
conveyed
to
a
public
-
house
in
the
neighbourhood
,
he
made
signs
for
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
and
in
all
probability
would
have
explained
the
cause
of
this
terrible
catastrophe
,
when
an
old
woman
,
seeing
the
windpipe
,
which
was
cut
,
sticking
out
of
the
wound
,
and
mistaking
it
for
the
gullet
,
by
way
of
giving
him
a
cordial
to
support
his
spirits
,
poured
into
it
,
through
a
small
funnel
,
a
glass
of
burnt
brandy
,
which
strangled
him
in
the
tenth
part
of
a
minute
.
<EOS>
The
gash
was
so
hideous
,
and
formed
by
so
many
repeated
strokes
of
a
razor
,
that
the
surgeons
believed
he
could
not
possibly
be
the
perpetrator
himself
;
nevertheless
this
was
certainly
the
case
.
  
<EOS>
At
Brignolles
,
where
we
dined
,
I
was
obliged
to
quarrel
with
the
landlady
,
and
threaten
to
leave
her
house
,
before
she
would
indulge
us
with
any
sort
of
flesh
-
meat
.
<EOS>
It
was
meagre
day
,
and
she
had
made
her
provision
accordingly
.
<EOS>
She
even
hinted
some
dissatisfaction
at
having
heretics
in
her
house
:
<EOS>
but
,
as
I
was
not
disposed
to
eat
stinking
fish
,
with
ragouts
of
eggs
and
onions
,
I
insisted
upon
a
leg
of
mutton
,
and
a
brace
of
fine
partridges
,
which
I
found
in
the
larder
.
<EOS>
Next
day
,
when
we
set
out
in
the
morning
from
Luc
,
it
blew
a
north
-
westerly
wind
so
extremely
cold
and
biting
,
that
even
a
flannel
wrapper
could
not
keep
me
tolerably
warm
in
the
coach
.
<EOS>
Whether
the
cold
had
put
our
coachman
in
a
bad
humour
,
or
he
had
some
other
cause
of
resentment
against
himself
,
I
know
not
;
but
we
had
not
gone
above
a
quarter
of
a
mile
,
when
he
drove
the
carriage
full
against
the
corner
of
a
garden
wall
,
and
broke
the
axle
-
tree
,
so
that
we
were
obliged
to
return
to
the
inn
on
foot
,
and
wait
a
whole
day
,
until
a
new
piece
could
be
made
and
adjusted
.
<EOS>
The
wind
that
blew
,
is
called
Maestral
,
in
the
Provencial
dialect
,
and
indeed
is
the
severest
that
ever
I
felt
.
<EOS>
At
this
inn
,
we
met
with
a
young
French
officer
who
had
been
a
prisoner
in
England
,
and
spoke
our
language
pretty
well
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
,
that
such
a
wind
did
not
blow
above
twice
or
three
times
in
a
winter
,
and
was
never
of
long
continuance
,
that
in
general
,
the
weather
was
very
mild
and
agreeable
during
the
winter
months
;
that
living
was
very
cheap
in
this
part
of
Provence
,
which
afforded
great
plenty
of
game
.
<EOS>
Here
,
too
,
I
found
a
young
Irish
recollet
,
in
his
way
from
Rome
to
his
own
country
.
<EOS>
He
complained
,
that
he
was
almost
starved
by
the
inhospitable
disposition
of
the
French
people
;
and
that
the
regular
clergy
,
in
particular
,
had
treated
him
with
the
most
cruel
disdain
.
<EOS>
I
relieved
his
necessities
,
and
gave
him
a
letter
to
a
gentleman
of
his
own
country
at
Montpellier
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
rose
in
the
morning
,
and
opened
a
window
that
looked
into
the
garden
,
I
thought
myself
either
in
a
dream
,
or
bewitched
.
<EOS>
All
the
trees
were
cloathed
with
snow
,
and
all
the
country
covered
at
least
a
foot
thick
.
<EOS>
"
This
can
not
be
the
south
of
France
,
(
said
I
to
myself
)
<EOS>
it
must
be
the
Highlands
of
Scotland
!
<EOS>
"
At
a
wretched
town
called
Muy
,
where
we
dined
,
I
had
a
warm
dispute
with
our
landlord
,
which
,
however
,
did
not
terminate
to
my
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
I
sent
on
the
mules
before
,
to
the
next
stage
,
resolving
to
take
post
-
horses
,
and
bespoke
them
accordingly
of
the
aubergiste
,
who
was
,
at
the
same
time
,
inn
-
keeper
and
post
-
master
.
<EOS>
We
were
ushered
into
the
common
eating
-
room
,
and
had
a
very
indifferent
dinner
;
after
which
,
I
sent
a
loui'dore
to
be
changed
,
in
order
to
pay
the
reckoning
.
<EOS>
The
landlord
,
instead
of
giving
the
full
change
,
deducted
three
livres
a
head
for
dinner
,
and
sent
in
the
rest
of
the
money
by
my
servant
.
<EOS>
Provoked
more
at
his
ill
manners
,
than
at
his
extortion
,
I
ferreted
him
out
of
a
bed
-
chamber
,
where
he
had
concealed
himself
,
and
obliged
him
to
restore
the
full
change
,
from
which
I
paid
him
at
the
rate
of
two
livres
a
head
.
<EOS>
He
refused
to
take
the
money
,
which
I
threw
down
on
the
table
;
and
the
horses
being
ready
,
stepped
into
the
coach
,
ordering
the
postillions
to
drive
on
.
<EOS>
Here
I
had
certainly
reckoned
without
my
host
.
<EOS>
The
fellows
declared
they
would
not
budge
,
until
I
should
pay
their
master
;
and
as
I
threatened
them
with
manual
chastisement
,
they
alighted
,
and
disappeared
in
a
twinkling
.
<EOS>
I
was
now
so
incensed
,
that
though
I
could
hardly
breathe
;
though
the
afternoon
was
far
advanced
,
and
<EOS>
the
street
covered
with
wet
snow
,
I
walked
to
the
consul
of
the
town
,
and
made
my
complaint
in
form
.
<EOS>
This
magistrate
,
who
seemed
to
be
a
taylor
,
accompanied
me
to
the
inn
,
where
by
this
time
the
whole
town
was
assembled
,
and
endeavoured
to
persuade
me
to
compromise
the
affair
.
<EOS>
I
said
,
as
he
was
the
magistrate
,
I
would
stand
to
his
award
.
<EOS>
He
answered
,
"
that
he
would
not
presume
to
determine
what
I
was
to
pay
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
paid
him
a
reasonable
price
for
his
dinner
,
(
said
I
)
<EOS>
and
now
I
demand
post
-
horses
according
to
the
king
's
ordonnance
.
<EOS>
The
aubergiste
said
the
horses
were
ready
,
but
the
guides
were
run
away
;
and
he
could
not
find
others
to
go
in
their
place
.
<EOS>
I
argued
with
great
vehemence
,
offering
to
leave
a
loui'dore
for
the
poor
of
the
parish
,
provided
the
consul
would
oblige
the
rascal
to
do
his
duty
.
<EOS>
The
consul
shrugged
up
his
shoulders
,
and
declared
it
was
not
in
his
power
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
lie
,
but
I
perceived
he
had
no
mind
to
disoblige
the
publican
.
<EOS>
If
the
mules
had
not
been
sent
away
,
I
should
certainly
have
not
only
payed
what
I
thought
proper
,
but
corrected
the
landlord
into
the
bargain
,
for
his
insolence
and
extortion
;
but
now
I
was
entirely
at
his
mercy
,
and
as
the
consul
continued
to
exhort
me
in
very
humble
terms
,
to
comply
with
his
demands
,
I
thought
proper
to
acquiesce
.
<EOS>
Then
the
postillions
immediately
appeared
:
the
crowd
seemed
to
exult
in
the
triumph
of
the
aubergiste
;
and
I
was
obliged
to
travel
in
the
night
,
in
very
severe
weather
,
after
all
the
fatigue
and
mortification
I
had
undergone
.
  
<EOS>
We
lay
at
Frejus
,
which
was
the
Forum
Julianum
of
the
antients
,
and
still
boasts
of
some
remains
of
antiquity
;
particularly
the
ruins
of
an
amphitheatre
,
and
an
aqueduct
.
<EOS>
The
first
we
passed
in
the
dark
,
and
next
morning
the
weather
was
so
cold
that
I
could
not
walk
abroad
to
see
it
.
<EOS>
The
town
is
at
present
very
inconsiderable
,
and
indeed
in
a
ruinous
condition
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
we
were
very
well
lodged
at
the
post
-
house
,
and
treated
with
more
politeness
than
we
had
met
with
in
any
other
part
of
France
.
  
<EOS>
As
we
had
a
very
high
mountain
to
ascend
in
the
morning
,
I
ordered
the
mules
on
before
to
the
next
post
,
and
hired
six
horses
for
the
coach
.
<EOS>
At
the
east
end
of
Frejus
,
we
saw
close
to
the
road
on
our
left
-
hand
,
the
arcades
of
the
antient
aqueduct
,
and
the
ruins
of
some
Roman
edifices
,
which
seemed
to
have
been
temples
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
striking
in
the
architecture
of
the
aqueduct
.
<EOS>
The
arches
are
small
and
low
,
without
either
grace
or
ornament
,
and
seem
to
have
been
calculated
for
mere
utility
.
  
<EOS>
The
mountain
of
Esterelles
,
which
is
eight
miles
over
,
was
formerly
frequented
by
a
gang
of
desperate
banditti
,
who
are
now
happily
exterminated
:
the
road
is
very
good
,
but
in
some
places
very
steep
and
bordered
by
precipices
.
<EOS>
The
mountain
is
covered
with
pines
,
and
the
laurus
cerasus
,
the
fruit
of
which
being
now
ripe
,
made
a
most
romantic
appearance
through
the
snow
that
lay
upon
the
branches
.
<EOS>
The
cherries
were
so
large
that
I
at
first
mistook
them
for
dwarf
oranges
.
<EOS>
I
think
they
are
counted
poisonous
in
England
,
but
here
the
people
eat
them
without
hesitation
.
<EOS>
In
the
middle
of
the
mountain
is
the
post
-
house
,
where
we
dined
in
a
room
so
cold
,
that
the
bare
remembrance
of
it
makes
my
teeth
chatter
.
<EOS>
After
dinner
I
chanced
to
look
into
another
chamber
that
fronted
the
south
,
where
the
sun
shone
;
and
opening
a
window
perceived
,
within
a
yard
of
my
hand
,
a
large
tree
loaded
with
oranges
,
many
of
which
were
ripe
.
<EOS>
You
may
judge
what
my
astonishment
was
to
find
Winter
in
all
his
rigour
reigning
on
one
side
of
the
house
,
and
Summer
in
all
her
glory
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
Certain
it
is
,
the
middle
of
this
mountain
seemed
to
be
the
boundary
of
the
cold
weather
.
<EOS>
As
we
proceeded
slowly
in
the
afternoon
we
were
quite
enchanted
.
<EOS>
This
side
of
the
hill
is
a
natural
plantation
of
the
most
agreeable
ever
-
greens
,
pines
,
firs
,
laurel
,
cypress
,
sweet
myrtle
,
tamarisc
,
box
,
and
juniper
,
interspersed
with
sweet
marjoram
,
lavender
,
thyme
,
wild
thyme
,
and
sage
.
<EOS>
On
the
right
-
hand
the
ground
shoots
up
into
agreeable
cones
,
between
which
you
have
delightful
vistas
of
the
Mediterranean
,
which
washes
the
foot
of
the
rock
;
and
between
two
divisions
of
the
mountains
,
there
is
a
bottom
watered
by
a
charming
stream
,
which
greatly
adds
to
the
rural
beauties
of
the
scene
.
  
<EOS>
This
night
we
passed
at
Cannes
,
a
little
fishing
town
,
agreeably
situated
on
the
beach
of
the
sea
,
and
in
the
same
place
lodged
Monsieur
Nadeau
d'Etrueil
,
the
unfortunate
French
governor
of
Guadeloupe
,
<EOS>
condemned
to
be
imprisoned
for
life
in
one
of
the
isles
Marguerite
,
which
lie
within
a
mile
of
this
coast
.
  
<EOS>
Next
day
we
journeyed
by
the
way
of
Antibes
,
a
small
maritime
town
,
tolerably
well
fortified
;
and
passing
the
little
river
Loup
,
over
a
stone
-
bridge
,
arrived
about
noon
at
the
village
of
St
Laurent
,
the
extremity
of
France
,
where
we
passed
the
Var
,
after
our
baggage
had
undergone
examination
.
<EOS>
From
Cannes
to
this
village
the
road
lies
along
the
sea
-
side
;
and
sure
nothing
can
be
more
delightful
.
<EOS>
Though
in
the
morning
there
was
a
frost
upon
the
ground
,
the
sun
was
as
warm
as
it
is
in
May
in
England
.
<EOS>
The
sea
was
quite
smooth
,
and
the
beach
formed
of
white
polished
pebbles
;
on
the
left
-
hand
the
country
was
covered
with
green
olives
,
and
the
side
of
the
road
planted
with
large
trees
of
sweet
myrtle
growing
wild
like
the
hawthorns
in
England
.
<EOS>
From
Antibes
we
had
the
first
view
of
Nice
,
lying
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
bay
,
and
making
a
very
agreeable
appearance
.
<EOS>
The
author
of
the
Grand
Tour
says
,
that
from
Antibes
to
Nice
the
roads
are
very
bad
,
through
rugged
mountains
bordered
with
precipices
On
the
left
,
and
by
the
sea
to
the
right
;
whereas
,
in
fact
,
there
is
neither
precipice
nor
mountain
near
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
Var
,
which
divides
the
county
of
Nice
from
Provence
,
is
no
other
than
a
torrent
fed
chiefly
by
the
snow
that
melts
on
the
maritime
Alps
,
from
which
it
takes
its
origin
.
<EOS>
In
the
summer
it
is
swelled
to
a
dangerous
height
,
and
this
is
also
the
case
after
heavy
rains
:
but
at
present
the
middle
of
it
is
quite
dry
,
and
the
water
divided
into
two
or
three
narrow
streams
,
which
,
however
,
are
both
deep
and
rapid
.
<EOS>
This
river
has
been
absurdly
enough
by
some
supposed
the
Rubicon
,
in
all
probability
from
the
description
of
that
river
in
the
Pharsalia
of
Lucan
,
who
makes
it
the
boundary
betwixt
Gaul
and
Italy
                             
<EOS>

A
sure
Frontier
that
parts
the
Gallic
plains
From
the
rich

of
th

Ansonian
swains
.
  
<EOS>
whereas
,
in
fact
,
the

,
now
called
Pisatello
,
runs
between
Ravenna
and
Rimini
.
 
<EOS>
But
to
return
to
the
Var
.
<EOS>
At
the
village
of
St
Laurent
,
famous
for
its
Muscadine
wines
,
there
is
a
set
of
guides
always
in
attendance
to
conduct
you
in
your
passage
over
the
river
.
<EOS>
Six
of
those
fellows
,
tucked
up
above
the
middle
,
with
long
poles
in
their
hands
,
took
charge
of
our
coach
,
and
by
many
windings
guided
it
safe
to
the
opposite
shore
.
<EOS>
Indeed
there
was
no
occasion
for
any
;
but
it
is
a
sort
of
a
perquisite
,
and
I
did
not
choose
to
run
any
risque
,
how
small
soever
it
might
be
,
for
the
sake
of
saving
half
a
crown
,
with
which
they
were
satisfied
.
<EOS>
If
you
do
not
gratify
the
searchers
at
St
Laurent
with
the
same
sum
,
they
will
rummage
your
trunks
,
and
turn
all
your
cloaths
topsy
turvy
.
<EOS>
And
here
,
once
for
all
,
I
would
advise
every
traveller
who
consults
his
own
case
and
convenience
,
to
be
liberal
of
his
money
to
all
that
sort
of
people
;
and
even
to
wink
at
the
imposition
of
aubergistes
on
the
road
,
unless
it
be
very
flagrant
.
<EOS>
So
sure
as
you
enter
into
disputes
with
them
,
you
will
be
put
to
a
great
deal
of
trouble
,
and
fret
yourself
to
no
manner
of
purpose
.
<EOS>
I
have
travelled
with
oeconomists
in
England
,
who
declared
they
would
rather
give
away
a
crown
than
allow
themselves
to
be
cheated
of
a
farthing
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
good
maxim
,
but
requires
a
great
share
of
resolution
and
self
-
denial
to
put
it
in
practice
.
<EOS>
In
one
excursion
of
about
two
hundred
miles
my
fellow
-
traveller
was
in
a
passion
,
and
of
consequence
very
bad
company
from
one
end
of
the
journey
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
He
was
incessantly
scolding
either
at
landlords
,
landladies
,
waiters
,
hostlers
,
or
postilions
.
<EOS>
We
had
bad
horses
,
and
bad
chaises
;
set
out
from
every
stage
with
the
curses
of
the
people
;
and
at
this
expence
I
saved
about
ten
shillings
in
the
whole
journey
.
<EOS>
For
such
a
paltry
consideration
,
he
was
contented
to
be
miserable
himself
,
and
to
make
every
other
person
unhappy
with
whom
he
had
any
concern
.
<EOS>
When
I
came
last
from
Bath
it
rained
so
hard
,
that
the
postilion
who
drove
the
chaise
was
wet
to
the
skin
before
we
had
gone
a
couple
of
miles
.
<EOS>
When
we
arrived
at
the
Devises
,
I
gave
him
two
shillings
instead
of
one
,
out
of
pure
compassion
.
<EOS>
The
consequence
of
this
liberality
was
,
that
in
the
next
stage
we
seemed
rather
to
fly
than
to
travel
upon
solid
ground
.
<EOS>
I
continued
my
bounty
to
the
second
driver
,
and
indeed
through
the
whole
journey
,
and
found
myself
accommodated
in
a
very
different
manner
from
what
I
had
experienced
before
.
<EOS>
I
had
elegant
chaises
,
with
excellent
horses
;
and
the
postilions
of
their
own
accord
used
such
diligence
,
that
although
the
roads
were
broken
by
the
rain
,
I
travelled
at
the
rate
of
twelve
miles
an
hour
;
and
my
extraordinary
expence
from
Bath
to
London
,
amounted
precisely
to
six
shillings
.
  
<EOS>
The
river
Var
falls
into
the
Mediterranean
a
little
below
St
Laurent
,
about
four
miles
to
the
westward
of
Nice
.
<EOS>
Within
the
memory
of
persons
now
living
,
there
have
been
three
wooden
bridges
thrown
over
it
,
and
as
often
destroyed
in
consequence
of
the
jealousy
subsisting
between
the
kings
of
France
and
Sardinia
;
this
river
being
the
boundary
of
their
dominions
on
the
side
of
Provence
.
<EOS>
However
,
this
is
a
consideration
that
ought
not
to
interfere
with
the
other
advantages
that
would
accrue
to
both
kingdoms
from
such
a
convenience
.
<EOS>
If
there
was
a
bridge
over
the
Var
,
and
a
post
-
road
made
from
Nice
to
Genoa
,
I
am
very
confident
that
all
those
strangers
who
now
pass
the
Alps
in
their
way
to
and
from
Italy
,
would
choose
this
road
as
infinitely
more
safe
,
commodious
,
and
agreeable
.
<EOS>
This
would
also
be
the
case
with
all
those
who
hire
felucas
from
Marseilles
or
Antibes
,
and
expose
themselves
to
the
dangers
and
inconveniences
of
travelling
by
sea
in
an
open
boat
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
afternoon
we
arrived
at
Nice
,
where
we
found
Mr
M
 
e
,
the
English
gentleman
whom
I
had
seen
at
Boulogne
,
and
advised
to
come
hither
.
<EOS>
He
had
followed
my
advice
,
and
reached
Nice
about
a
month
before
my
arrival
,
with
his
lady
,
child
,
and
an
old
gouvernante
.
<EOS>
He
had
travelled
with
his
own
post
-
chaise
and
horses
,
and
is
now
lodged
just
without
one
of
the
gates
of
the
city
,
in
the
house
of
the
count
de
V
 
n
,
for
which
he
pays
five
loui'dores
a
month
.
<EOS>
I
could
hire
one
much
better
in
the
neighbourhood
of
London
,
for
the
same
money
.
<EOS>
Unless
you
will
submit
to
this
extortion
,
and
hire
a
whole
house
for
a
length
of
time
,
you
will
find
no
ready
-
furnished
lodgings
at
Nice
.
<EOS>
After
having
stewed
a
week
in
a
paltry
inn
,
I
have
taken
a
ground
floor
for
ten
months
at
the
rate
of
four
hundred
livres
a
year
,
that
is
twenty
pounds
sterling
,
for
the
Piedmontese
livre
is
about
an
English
shilling
.
<EOS>
The
apartments
are
large
,
lofty
,
and
commodious
enough
,
with
two
small
gardens
,
in
which
there
is
plenty
of
sallad
,
and
a
great
number
of
oranges
and
lemons
:
but
as
it
required
some
time
to
provide
furniture
,
our
consul
Mr
B
 
d
,
one
of
the
best
natured
and
most
friendly
men
in
the
world
,
has
lent
me
his
lodgings
,
which
are
charmingly
situated
by
the
sea
-
side
,
and
open
upon
a
terrace
,
that
runs
parallel
to
the
beach
,
forming
part
of
the
town
wall
.
<EOS>
Mr
B
 
d
<EOS>
himself
lives
at
Villa
Franca
,
which
is
divided
from
Nice
by
a
single
mountain
,
on
the
top
of
which
there
is
a
small
fort
,
called
the
castle
of
Montalban
.
<EOS>
Immediately
after
our
arrival
we
were
visited
by
one
Mr
de
Martines
,
a
most
agreeable
young
fellow
,
a
lieutenant
in
the
Swiss
regiment
,
which
is
here
in
garrison
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
Protestant
,
extremely
fond
of
our
nation
,
and
understands
our
language
tolerably
well
.
<EOS>
He
was
particularly
recommended
to
our
acquaintance
by
general
P
  
and
his
lady
;
we
are
happy
in
his
conversation
;
find
him
wonderfully
obliging
,
and
extremely
serviceable
on
many
occasions
.
<EOS>
We
have
likewise
made
acquaintance
with
some
other
individuals
,
particularly
with
Mr
St
Pierre
,
junior
,
who
is
a
considerable
merchant
,
and
consul
for
Naples
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
well
-
bred
,
sensible
young
man
,
speaks
English
,
is
an
excellent
performer
on
the
lute
and
mandolin
,
and
has
a
pretty
collection
of
books
.
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
I
hope
we
shall
pass
the
winter
agreeably
enough
,
especially
if
Mr
M
 
e
should
hold
out
;
but
I
am
afraid
he
is
too
far
gone
in
a
consumption
to
recover
.
<EOS>
He
spent
the
last
winter
at
Nismes
,
and
consulted
F
  
at
Montpellier
.
<EOS>
I
was
impatient
to
see
the
prescription
,
and
found
it
almost
verbatim
the
same
he
had
sent
to
me
;
although
I
am
persuaded
there
is
a
very
essential
difference
between
our
disorders
.
<EOS>
Mr
M
 
e
has
been
long
afflicted
with
violent
spasms
,
colliquative
sweats
,
prostration
of
appetite
,
and
a
disorder
in
his
bowels
.
<EOS>
He
is
likewise
jaundiced
all
over
,
and
I
am
confident
his
liver
is
unsound
.
<EOS>
He
tried
the
tortoise
soup
,
which
he
said
in
a
fortnight
stuffed
him
up
with
phlegm
.
<EOS>
This
gentleman
has
got
a
smattering
of
physic
,
and
I
am
afraid
tampers
with
his
own
constitution
,
by
means
of
Brookes
's
Practice
of
Physic
,
and
some
dispensatories
,
which
he
is
continually
poring
over
.
<EOS>
I
beg
pardon
for
this
tedious
epistle
,
and
am
 
Very
sincerely
,
dear
Sir
,
Your
affectionate
,
humble
servant
.
   
<EOS>
NICE
,
January
15
,
1764
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
<EOS>
I
am
at
last
settled
at
Nice
,
and
have
leisure
to
give
you
some
account
of
this
very
remarkable
place
.
<EOS>
The
county
of
Nice
extends
about
fourscore
miles
in
length
,
and
in
some
places
it
is
thirty
miles
broad
.
<EOS>
It
contains
several
small
towns
,
and
a
great
number
of
villages
;
all
of
which
,
this
capital
excepted
,
are
situated
among
mountains
,
the
most
extensive
plain
of
the
whole
country
being
this
where
I
now
am
,
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Nice
.
<EOS>
The
length
of
it
does
not
exceed
two
miles
,
nor
is
the
breadth
of
it
,
in
any
part
,
above
one
.
<EOS>
It
is
bounded
by
the
Mediterranean
on
the
south
.
<EOS>
From
the
sea
-
shore
,
the
maritime
Alps
begin
with
hills
of
a
gentle
ascent
,
rising
into
mountains
that
form
a
sweep
or
amphitheatre
ending
at
Montalban
,
which
overhangs
the
town
of
Villa
Franca
.
<EOS>
On
the
west
side
of
this
mountain
,
and
in
the
eastern
extremity
of
the
amphitheatre
,
stands
the
city
of
Nice
,
wedged
in
between
a
steep
rock
and
the
little
river
Paglion
,
which
descends
from
the
mountains
,
and
washing
the
town
-
walls
on
the
west
side
,
falls
into
the
sea
,
after
having
filled
some
canals
for
the
use
of
the
inhabitants
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
stone
-
bridge
of
three
arches
over
it
,
by
which
those
who
come
from
Provence
enter
the
city
.
<EOS>
The
channel
of
it
is
very
broad
,
but
generally
dry
in
many
places
;
the
water
(
as
in
the
Var
)
dividing
itself
into
several
small
streams
.
<EOS>
The
Paglion
being
fed
by
melted
snow
and
rain
in
the
mountains
,
is
quite
dry
in
summer
;
but
it
is
sometimes
swelled
by
sudden
rains
to
a
very
formidable
torrent
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
case
in
the
year
1744
,
when
the
French
and
Spanish
armies
attacked
eighteen
Piedmontese
battalions
,
which
were
posted
on
the
side
of
Montalban
.
<EOS>
The
assailants
were
repulsed
with
the
loss
of
four
thousand
men
,
some
hundreds
of
whom
perished
in
repassing
the
Paglion
,
which
had
swelled
to
a
surprising
degree
during
the
battle
,
in
consequence
of
a
heavy
continued
rain
.
<EOS>
This
rain
was
of
great
service
to
the
Piedmontese
,
as
it
prevented
one
half
of
the
enemy
from
passing
the
river
to
sustain
the
other
.
<EOS>
Five
hundred
were
taken
prisoners
:
but
the
Piedmontese
,
foreseeing
they
should
be
surrounded
next
day
by
the
French
,
who
had
penetrated
behind
them
,
by
a
pass
in
the
mountains
,
retired
in
the
night
.
<EOS>
Being
received
on
board
the
English
Fleet
,
which
lay
at
Villa
Franca
,
they
were
conveyed
to
Oneglia
.
<EOS>
In
examining
the
bodies
of
those
that
were
killed
in
the
battle
,
the
inhabitants
of
Nice
perceived
,
that
a
great
number
of
the
Spanish
soldiers
were
circumcised
;
a
circumstance
,
from
which
they
concluded
,
that
a
great
many
Jews
engage
in
the
service
of
his
Catholic
majesty
.
<EOS>
I
am
of
a
different
opinion
.
<EOS>
The
Jews
are
the
least
of
any
people
that
I
know
,
addicted
to
a
military
life
.
<EOS>
I
rather
imagine
they
were
of
the
Moorish
race
,
who
have
subsisted
in
Spain
,
since
the
expulsion
of
their
brethren
;
and
though
they
conform
externally
to
the
rites
of
the
Catholic
religion
,
still
retain
in
private
their
attachment
to
the
law
of
Mahomet
.
  
<EOS>
The
city
of
Nice
is
built
in
form
of
an
irregular
isosceles
triangle
,
the
base
of
which
fronts
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
west
side
it
is
surrounded
by
a
wall
and
rampart
;
on
the
east
,
it
is
over
-
hung
by
a
rock
,
on
which
we
see
the
ruins
of
an
old
castle
,
which
,
before
the
invention
of
artillery
,
was
counted
impregnable
.
<EOS>
It
was
taken
and
dismantled
by
marechal
Catinat
,
in
the
time
of
Victor
Amadaeus
,
the
father
of
his
Sardinian
majesty
.
<EOS>
It
was
afterwards
finally
demolished
by
the
duke
of
Berwick
towards
the
latter
end
of
queen
Anne
's
war
.
<EOS>
To
repair
it
would
be
a
very
unnecessary
expence
,
as
it
is
commanded
by
Montalban
,
and
several
other
eminences
.
  
<EOS>
The
town
of
Nice
is
altogether
indefensible
,
and
therefore
without
fortifications
.
<EOS>
There
are
only
two
iron
guns
upon
a
bastion
that
fronts
the
beach
;
and
here
the
French
had
formed
a
considerable
battery
against
the
English
cruisers
,
in
the
war
of
1744
,
when
the
Mareschal
Duke
de
Belleisle
had
his
headquarters
at
Nice
.
<EOS>
This
little
town
,
situated
in
the
bay
of
Antibes
,
is
almost
equidistant
from
Marseilles
,
Turin
,
and
Genoa
,
the
first
and
last
being
about
thirty
leagues
from
hence
by
sea
;
and
the
capital
of
Piedmont
at
the
same
distance
to
the
northward
,
over
the
mountains
.
<EOS>
It
lies
exactly
opposite
to
Capo
di
Ferro
,
on
the
coast
of
Barbary
;
and
,
the
islands
of
Sardinia
and
Corsica
are
laid
down
about
two
degrees
to
the
eastward
,
almost
exactly
in
a
line
with
Genoa
.
<EOS>
This
little
town
,
hardly
a
mile
in
circumference
,
is
said
to
contain
twelve
thousand
inhabitants
.
<EOS>
The
streets
are
narrow
;
the
houses
are
built
of
stone
,
and
the
windows
in
general
are
fitted
with
paper
instead
of
glass
.
<EOS>
This
expedient
would
not
answer
in
a
country
subject
to
rain
and
storms
;
but
here
,
where
there
is
very
little
of
either
,
the
paper
lozenges
answer
tolerably
well
.
<EOS>
The
bourgeois
,
however
,
begin
to
have
their
houses
sashed
with
glass
.
<EOS>
Between
the
town
-
wall
and
the
sea
,
the
fishermen
haul
up
their
boats
upon
the
open
beach
;
but
on
the
other
side
of
the
rock
,
where
the
castle
stood
,
is
the
port
or
harbour
of
Nice
,
upon
which
some
money
has
been
expended
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
small
basin
,
defended
to
seaward
by
a
mole
of
free
-
stone
,
which
is
much
better
contrived
than
executed
:
for
the
sea
has
already
made
three
breaches
in
it
;
and
in
all
probability
,
in
another
winter
,
the
extremity
of
it
will
be
carried
quite
away
.
<EOS>
It
would
require
the
talents
of
a
very
skilful
architect
to
lay
the
foundation
of
a
good
mole
,
on
an
open
beach
like
this
;
exposed
to
the
swell
of
the
whole
Mediterranean
,
without
any
island
or
rock
in
the
offing
,
to
break
the
force
of
the
waves
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
the
shore
is
bold
,
and
the
bottom
foul
.
<EOS>
There
are
seventeen
feet
of
water
in
the
basin
,
sufficient
to
float
vessels
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
ton
;
and
this
is
chiefly
supplied
by
a
small
stream
of
very
fine
water
;
another
great
convenience
for
shipping
.
<EOS>
On
the
side
of
the
mole
,
there
is
a
constant
guard
of
soldiers
,
and
a
battery
of
seven
cannon
,
pointing
to
the
sea
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
side
,
there
is
a
curious
manufacture
for
twisting
or
reeling
silk
;
a
tavern
,
a
coffee
-
house
,
and
several
other
buildings
,
for
the
convenience
of
the
sea
-
faring
people
.
<EOS>
Without
the
harbour
,
is
a
lazarette
,
where
persons
coming
from
infected
places
,
are
obliged
to
perform
quarantine
.
<EOS>
The
harbour
has
been
declared
a
free
-
port
,
and
it
is
generally
full
of
tartans
,
polacres
,
and
other
small
vessels
,
that
come
from
Sardinia
,
Ivica
,
Italy
,
and
Spain
,
loaded
with
salt
,
wine
,
and
other
commodities
;
but
here
is
no
trade
of
any
great
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
The
city
of
Nice
is
provided
with
a
senate
,
which
administers
justice
under
the
auspices
of
an
avocat
-
general
,
sent
hither
by
the
king
.
<EOS>
The
internal
oeconomy
of
the
town
is
managed
by
four
consuls
;
one
for
the
noblesse
.
<EOS>
another
for
the
merchants
,
a
third
for
the
bourgeois
,
and
a
fourth
for
the
peasants
.
<EOS>
These
are
chosen
annually
from
the
town
-
council
.
<EOS>
They
keep
the
streets
and
markets
in
order
,
and
superintend
the
public
works
.
<EOS>
There
is
also
an
intendant
,
who
takes
care
of
his
majesty
's
revenue
:
but
there
is
a
discretionary
power
lodged
in
the
person
of
the
commandant
,
who
is
always
an
officer
of
rank
in
the
service
,
and
has
under
his
immediate
command
the
regiment
which
is
here
in
garrison
.
<EOS>
That
which
is
here
now
is
a
Swiss
battalion
,
of
which
the
king
has
five
or
six
in
his
service
.
<EOS>
There
is
likewise
a
regiment
of
militia
,
which
is
exercised
once
a
year
.
<EOS>
But
of
all
these
particulars
,
I
shall
speak
more
fully
on
another
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
stand
upon
the
rampart
,
and
look
round
me
,
I
can
scarce
help
thinking
myself
inchanted
.
<EOS>
The
small
extent
of
country
which
I
see
,
is
all
cultivated
like
a
garden
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
plain
presents
nothing
but
gardens
,
full
of
green
trees
,
loaded
with
oranges
,
lemons
,
citrons
,
and
bergamots
,
which
make
a
delightful
appearance
.
<EOS>
If
you
examine
them
more
nearly
,
you
will
find
plantations
of
green
pease
ready
to
gather
;
all
sorts
of
sallading
,
and
pot
-
herbs
,
in
perfection
;
and
plats
of
roses
,
carnations
,
ranunculas
,
anemonies
,
and
daffodils
,
blowing
in
full
glory
,
with
such
beauty
,
vigour
,
and
perfume
,
as
no
flower
in
England
ever
exhibited
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
tell
you
,
that
presents
of
carnations
are
sent
from
hence
,
in
the
winter
,
to
Turin
and
Paris
;
nay
,
sometimes
as
far
as
London
,
by
the
post
.
<EOS>
They
are
packed
up
in
a
wooden
box
,
without
any
sort
of
preparation
,
one
pressed
upon
another
:
the
person
who
receives
them
,
cuts
off
a
little
bit
of
the
stalk
,
and
steeps
them
for
two
hours
in
vinegar
and
water
,
when
they
recover
their
full
bloom
and
beauty
.
<EOS>
Then
he
places
them
in
water
-
bottles
,
in
an
apartment
where
they
are
screened
from
the
severities
of
the
weather
;
and
they
will
continue
fresh
and
unfaded
the
best
part
of
a
month
.
  
<EOS>
Amidst
the
plantations
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Nice
,
appear
a
vast
number
of
white
bastides
,
or
country
-
houses
,
which
make
a
dazzling
shew
.
<EOS>
Some
few
of
these
are
good
villas
,
belonging
to
the
noblesse
of
this
county
;
and
even
some
of
the
bourgeois
are
provided
with
pretty
lodgeable
cassines
;
but
in
general
,
they
are
the
habitations
of
the
peasants
,
and
contain
nothing
but
misery
and
vermin
.
<EOS>
They
are
all
built
square
;
and
,
being
whitened
with
lime
or
plaister
,
contribute
greatly
to
the
richness
of
the
view
.
<EOS>
The
hills
are
shaded
to
the
tops
with
olive
-
trees
,
which
are
always
green
;
and
those
hills
are
over
-
topped
by
more
distant
mountains
,
covered
with
snow
.
<EOS>
When
I
turn
myself
towards
the
sea
,
the
view
is
bounded
by
the
horizon
;
yet
in
a
clear
morning
,
one
can
perceive
the
high
lands
of
Corsica
.
<EOS>
On
the
right
hand
,
it
is
terminated
by
Antibes
,
and
the
mountain
of
Esterelles
,
which
I
described
in
my
last
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
weather
,
you
will
conclude
,
from
what
I
have
said
of
the
oranges
,
flowers
,
etc
.
<EOS>
that
it
must
be
wonderfully
mild
and
serene
:
<EOS>
but
of
the
climate
,
I
shall
speak
hereafter
.
<EOS>
Let
me
only
observe
,
en
passant
,
that
the
houses
in
general
have
no
chimnies
,
but
in
their
kitchens
;
and
that
many
people
,
even
of
condition
,
at
Nice
,
have
no
fire
in
their
chambers
,
during
the
whole
winter
.
<EOS>
When
the
weather
happens
to
be
a
little
more
sharp
than
usual
,
they
warm
their
apartments
with
a
brasiere
or
pan
of
charcoal
.
  
<EOS>
Though
Nice
itself
retains
few
marks
of
antient
splendor
,
there
are
considerable
monuments
of
antiquity
in
its
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
About
two
short
miles
from
the
town
,
upon
the
summit
of
a
pretty
high
hill
,
we
find
the
ruins
of
the
antient
city
Cemenelion
,
now
called
Cimia
,
which
was
once
the
metropolis
of
the
Maritime
Alps
,
and
the
scat
of
a
Roman
president
.
<EOS>
With
respect
to
situation
,
nothing
could
be
more
agreeable
or
salubrious
.
<EOS>
It
stood
upon
the
gentle
ascent
and
summit
of
a
hill
,
fronting
the
Mediterranean
;
from
the
shore
of
which
,
it
is
distant
about
half
a
league
;
and
,
on
the
other
side
,
it
overlooked
a
bottom
,
or
narrow
vale
,
through
which
the
Paglion
(
antiently
called
Paulo
)
<EOS>
runs
towards
the
walls
of
Nice
.
<EOS>
It
was
inhabited
by
a
people
,
whom
Ptolomy
and
Pliny
call
the
Vedantij
:
but
<EOS>
these
were
undoubtedly
mixed
with
a
Roman
colony
,
as
appears
by
the
monuments
which
still
remain
;
I
mean
the
ruins
of
an
amphitheatre
,
a
temple
of
Apollo
,
baths
,
aqueducts
,
sepulchral
,
and
other
stones
,
with
inscriptions
,
and
a
great
number
of
medals
which
the
peasants
have
found
by
accident
,
in
digging
and
labouring
the
vineyards
and
cornfields
,
which
now
cover
the
ground
where
the
city
stood
.
  
<EOS>
Touching
this
city
,
very
little
is
to
be
learned
from
the
antient
historians
:
but
that
it
was
the
seat
of
a
Roman
praeses
,
is
proved
by
the
two
following
inscriptions
,
which
are
still
extant
.

on

marble
,
which
is
now
placed
over
the
gate
of
the

<EOS>
This
St
Pont
,
or
Pontius
,
was
a
Roman
convert
to
Christianity
,
who
suffered
martyrdom
at
Cemenelion
in
the
year
261
,
during
the
reigns
of

Valerian

literally

am
doubtful
about
the
meaning

]
  
<EOS>
The
amphitheatre
of
Cemenelion
is
but
very
small
,
compared
to
that
of
Nismes
.
<EOS>
The
arena
is
ploughed
up
,
and
bears
corn
:
some
of
the
seats
remain
,
and
part
of
two
opposite
porticos
;
but
all
the
columns
,
and
the
external
facade
of
the
building
,
are
taken
away
so
that
it
is
impossible
to
judge
of
the
architecture
,
all
we
can
perceive
is
,
that
it
was
built
in
an
oval
form
.
<EOS>
About
one
hundred
paces
from
the
amphitheatre
stood
an
antient
temple
,
supposed
to
have
been
dedicated
to
Apollo
.
<EOS>
The
original
roof
is
demolished
,
as
well
as
the
portico
;
the
vestiges
of
which
may
still
be
traced
.
<EOS>
The
part
called
the
Basilica
,
and
about
one
half
of
the
Cella
Sanctior
,
remain
,
and
are
converted
into
the
dwelling
-
house
and
stable
of
the
peasant
who
takes
care
of
the
count
de
Gubernatis
's
garden
,
in
which
this
monument
stands
.
<EOS>
In
the
Cella
Sanctior
,
I
found
a
lean
cow
,
a
he
-
goat
,
and
a
jack
-
ass
;
the
very
same
conjunction
of
animals
which
I
had
seen
drawing
a
plough
in
Burgundy
.
<EOS>
Several
mutilated
statues
have
been
dug
up
from
the
ruins
of
this
temple
;
and
a
great
number
of
medals
have
been
found
in
the
different
vineyards
which
now
occupy
the
space
upon
which
stood
the
antient
city
of
Cemenelion
.
<EOS>
These
were
of
gold
,
silver
,
and
brass
.
<EOS>
Many
of
them
were
presented
to
Charles
Emanuel
I
,
duke
of
Savoy
.
<EOS>
The
prince
of
Monaco
has
a
good
number
of
them
in
his
collection
;
and
the
rest
are
in
private
hands
.
<EOS>
The
peasants
,
in
digging
,
have
likewise
found
many
urns
,
lachrymatories
,
and
sepulchral
stones
,
with
epitaphs
,
which
are
now
dispersed
among
different
convents
and
private
houses
.
<EOS>
All
this
ground
is
a
rich
mine
of
antiquities
,
which
,
if
properly
worked
,
would
produce
a
great
number
of
valuable
curiosities
.
<EOS>
Just
by
the
temple
of
Apollo
were
the
ruins
of
a
bath
,
composed
of
great
blocks
of
marble
,
which
have
been
taken
away
for
the
purposes
of
modern
building
.
<EOS>
In
all
probability
,
many
other
noble
monuments
of
this
city
have
been
dilapidated
by
the
same
barbarous
oeconomy
.
<EOS>
There
are
some
subterranean
vaults
,
through
which
the
water
was
conducted
to
this
bath
,
still
extant
in
the
garden
of
the
count
de
Gubernatis
.
<EOS>
Of
the
aqueduct
that
conveyed
water
to
the
town
,
I
can
say
very
little
,
but
that
it
was
scooped
through
a
mountain
:
that
this
subterranean
passage
was
discovered
some
years
ago
,
by
removing
the
rubbish
which
choaked
it
up
:
that
the
people
penetrating
a
considerable
way
,
by
the
help
of
lighted
torches
,
found
a
very
plentiful
stream
of
water
flowing
in
an
aqueduct
,
as
high
as
an
ordinary
man
,
arched
over
head
,
and
lined
with
a
sort
of
cement
.
<EOS>
They
could
not
,
however
,
trace
this
stream
to
its
source
;
and
it
is
again
stopped
up
with
earth
and
rubbish
.
<EOS>
There
is
not
a
soul
in
this
country
,
who
has
either
spirit
or
understanding
to
conduct
an
inquiry
of
this
kind
.
<EOS>
Hard
by
the
amphitheatre
is
a
convent
of
Recollets
,
built
in
a
very
romantic
situation
,
on
the
brink
of
a
precipice
.
<EOS>
On
one
side
of
their
garden
,
they
ascend
to
a
kind
of
esplanade
,
which
they
say
was
part
of
the
citadel
of
Cemenelion
.
<EOS>
They
have
planted
it
with
cypress
-
trees
,
and
flowering
-
shrubs
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
monks
told
me
,
that
it
is
vaulted
below
,
as
they
can
plainly
perceive
by
the
sound
of
their
instruments
used
in
houghing
the
ground
.
<EOS>
A
very
small
expence
would
bring
the
secrets
of
this
cavern
to
light
.
<EOS>
They
have
nothing
to
do
,
but
to
make
a
breach
in
the
wall
,
which
appears
uncovered
towards
the
garden
.
  
<EOS>
The
city
of
Cemenelion
was
first
sacked
by
the
Longobards
,
who
made
an
irruption
into
Provence
,
under
their
king
Alboinus
,
about
the
middle
of
the
sixth
century
.
<EOS>
It
was
afterwards
totally
destroyed
by
the
Saracens
,
who
,
at
different
times
,
ravaged
this
whole
coast
.
<EOS>
The
remains
of
the
people
are
supposed
to
have
changed
their
habitation
,
and
formed
a
coalition
with
the
inhabitants
of
Nice
.
  
<EOS>
What
further
I
have
to
say
of
Nice
,
you
shall
know
in
good
time
;
at
present
,
I
have
nothing
to
add
,
but
what
you
very
well
know
,
that
I
am
always
your
affectionate
humble
servant
.

NICE

<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
<EOS>
Last
Sunday
I
crossed
Montalban
on
horseback
,
with
some
Swiss
officers
,
on
a
visit
to
our
consul
,
Mr
B
 
d
,
who
lives
at
Ville
Franche
,
about
half
a
league
from
Nice
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
small
town
,
built
upon
the
side
of
a
rock
,
at
the
bottom
of
the
harbour
,
which
is
a
fine
basin
,
surrounded
with
hills
on
every
side
,
except
to
the
south
,
where
it
lies
open
to
the
sea
.
<EOS>
If
there
was
a
small
island
in
the
mouth
of
it
,
to
break
off
the
force
of
the
waves
,
when
the
wind
is
southerly
,
it
would
be
one
of
the
finest
harbours
in
the
world
;
for
the
ground
is
exceeding
good
for
anchorage
:
there
is
a
sufficient
depth
of
water
,
and
room
enough
for
the
whole
navy
of
England
.
<EOS>
On
the
right
hand
,
as
you
enter
the
port
,
there
is
an
elegant
fanal
,
or
lighthouse
,
kept
in
good
repair
:
but
in
all
the
charts
of
this
coast
which
I
have
seen
,
this
lanthorn
is
laid
down
to
the
westward
of
the
harbour
;
an
error
equally
absurd
and
dangerous
,
as
it
may
mislead
the
navigator
,
and
induce
him
to
run
his
ship
among
the
rocks
,
to
the
eastward
of
the
lighthouse
,
where
it
would
undoubtedly
perish
.
<EOS>
Opposite
to
the
mouth
of
the
harbour
is
the
fort
,
which
can
be
of
no
service
,
but
in
defending
the
shipping
and
the
town
by
sea
;
for
,
by
land
,
it
is
commanded
by
Montalban
,
and
all
the
hills
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
In
the
war
of
1744
,
it
was
taken
and
retaken
.
<EOS>
At
present
,
it
is
in
tolerable
good
repair
.
<EOS>
On
the
left
of
the
fort
,
is
the
basin
for
the
gallies
,
with
a
kind
of
dock
,
in
which
they
are
built
,
and
occasionally
laid
up
to
be
refitted
.
<EOS>
This
basin
is
formed
by
a
pretty
stone
mole
;
and
here
his
Sardinian
majesty
's
two
gallies
lie
perfectly
secure
,
moored
with
their
sterns
close
to
the
jette
.
<EOS>
I
went
on
board
one
of
these
vessels
,
and
saw
about
two
hundred
miserable
wretches
,
chained
to
the
banks
on
which
they
sit
and
row
,
when
the
galley
is
at
sea
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
sight
which
a
British
subject
,
sensible
of
the
blessing
he
enjoys
,
can
not
behold
without
horror
and
compassion
.
<EOS>
Not
but
that
if
we
consider
the
nature
of
the
case
,
with
coolness
and
deliberation
,
we
must
acknowledge
the
justice
,
and
even
sagacity
,
of
employing
for
the
service
of
the
public
,
those
malefactors
who
have
forfeited
their
title
to
the
privileges
of
the
community
.
<EOS>
Among
the
slaves
at
Ville
Franche
is
a
Piedmontese
count
,
condemned
to
the
gallies
for
life
,
in
consequence
of
having
been
convicted
of
forgery
.
<EOS>
He
is
permitted
to
live
on
shore
;
and
gets
money
by
employing
the
other
slaves
to
knit
stockings
for
sale
.
<EOS>
He
appears
always
in
the
Turkish
habit
,
and
is
in
a
fair
way
of
raising
a
better
fortune
than
that
which
he
has
forfeited
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
a
great
pity
,
however
,
and
a
manifest
outrage
against
the
law
of
nations
,
as
well
as
of
humanity
,
to
mix
with
those
banditti
,
the
Moorish
and
Turkish
prisoners
who
are
taken
in
the
prosecution
of
open
war
.
<EOS>
It
is
certainly
no
justification
of
this
barbarous
practice
,
that
the
Christian
prisoners
are
treated
as
cruelly
at
Tunis
and
Algiers
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
for
the
honour
of
Christendom
,
to
set
an
example
of
generosity
to
the
Turks
;
and
,
if
they
would
not
follow
it
,
to
join
their
naval
forces
,
and
extirpate
at
once
those
nests
of
pirates
,
who
have
so
long
infested
the
Mediterranean
.
<EOS>
Certainly
,
nothing
can
be
more
shameful
,
than
the
treaties
which
France
and
the
Maritime
Powers
have
concluded
with
those
barbarians
.
<EOS>
They
supply
them
with
artillery
,
arms
,
and
ammunition
,
to
disturb
their
neighbours
.
<EOS>
They
even
pay
them
a
sort
of
tribute
,
under
the
denomination
of
presents
;
and
often
put
up
with
insults
tamely
,
for
the
sordid
consideration
of
a
little
gain
in
the
way
of
commerce
.
<EOS>
They
know
that
Spain
,
Sardinia
,
and
almost
all
the
Catholic
powers
in
the
Mediterranean
,
Adriatic
,
and
Levant
,
are
at
perpetual
war
with
those
Mahometans
;
that
while
Algiers
,
Tunis
,
and
Sallee
,
maintain
armed
cruisers
at
sea
,
those
Christian
powers
will
not
run
the
risque
of
trading
in
their
own
bottoms
,
but
rather
employ
as
carriers
the
maritime
nations
,
who
are
at
peace
with
the
infidels
.
<EOS>
It
is
for
our
share
of
this
advantage
,
that
we
cultivate
the
piratical
States
of
Barbary
,
and
meanly
purchase
passports
of
them
,
thus
acknowledging
them
masters
of
the
Mediterranean
.
  
<EOS>
The
Sardinian
gallies
are
mounted
each
with
five
-
and
-
twenty
oars
,
and
six
guns
,
six
-
pounders
,
of
a
side
,
and
a
large
piece
of
artillery
amidships
,
pointing
ahead
,
which
(
so
far
as
I
am
able
to
judge
)
can
never
be
used
point
-
blank
,
without
demolishing
the
head
or
prow
of
the
galley
.
<EOS>
The
accommodation
on
board
for
the
officers
is
wretched
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
paltry
cabin
in
the
poop
for
the
commander
;
but
all
the
other
officers
lie
below
the
slaves
,
in
a
dungeon
,
where
they
have
neither
light
,
air
,
nor
any
degree
of
quiet
;
half
suffocated
by
the
heat
of
the
place
;
tormented
by
fleas
,
bugs
,
and
lice
;
and
disturbed
by
the
incessant
noise
over
head
.
<EOS>
The
slaves
lie
upon
the
naked
banks
,
without
any
other
covering
than
a
tilt
.
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
is
no
great
hardship
,
in
a
climate
where
there
is
scarce
any
winter
.
<EOS>
They
are
fed
with
a
very
scanty
allowance
of
bread
,
and
about
fourteen
beans
a
day
and
twice
a
week
<EOS>
they
have
a
little
rice
,
or
cheese
,
but
most
of
them
,
while
they
are
in
harbour
knit
stockings
,
or
do
some
other
kind
of
work
,
which
enables
them
to
make
some
addition
to
this
wretched
allowance
.
<EOS>
When
they
happen
to
be
at
sea
in
bad
weather
,
their
situation
is
truly
deplorable
.
<EOS>
Every
wave
breaks
over
the
vessel
,
and
not
only
keeps
them
continually
wet
,
but
comes
with
such
force
,
that
they
are
dashed
against
the
banks
with
surprising
violence
:
sometimes
their
limbs
are
broke
,
and
sometimes
their
brains
dashed
out
.
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
(
they
say
)
to
keep
such
a
number
of
desperate
people
under
any
regular
command
,
without
exercising
such
severities
as
must
shock
humanity
.
<EOS>
It
is
almost
equally
impossible
to
maintain
any
tolerable
degree
of
cleanliness
,
where
such
a
number
of
wretches
are
crouded
together
without
conveniences
,
or
even
the
necessaries
of
life
.
<EOS>
They
are
ordered
twice
a
week
to
strip
,
clean
,
and
bathe
themselves
in
the
sea
:
but
,
notwithstanding
all
the
precautions
of
discipline
,
they
swarm
with
vermin
,
and
the
vessel
smells
like
an
hospital
,
or
crouded
jail
.
<EOS>
They
seem
,
nevertheless
,
quite
insensible
of
their
misery
,
like
so
many
convicts
in
Newgate
:
they
laugh
and
sing
,
and
swear
,
and
get
drunk
when
they
can
.
<EOS>
When
you
enter
by
the
stern
,
you
are
welcomed
by
a
band
of
music
selected
from
the
slaves
;
and
these
expect
a
gratification
.
<EOS>
If
you
walk
forwards
,
you
must
take
care
of
your
pockets
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
accosted
by
one
or
other
of
the
slaves
,
with
a
brush
and
blacking
-
ball
for
cleaning
your
shoes
;
and
if
you
undergo
this
operation
,
it
is
ten
to
one
<EOS>
but
your
pocket
is
picked
.
<EOS>
If
you
decline
his
service
,
and
keep
aloof
,
you
will
find
it
almost
impossible
to
avoid
a
colony
of
vermin
,
which
these
fellows
have
a
very
dexterous
method
of
conveying
to
strangers
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
Turkish
prisoners
,
whose
ransom
or
exchange
is
expected
,
are
allowed
to
go
ashore
,
under
proper
inspection
;
and
those
forcats
,
who
have
served
the
best
part
of
the
time
for
which
they
were
condemned
,
are
employed
in
public
works
,
under
a
guard
of
soldiers
.
<EOS>
At
the
harbour
of
Nice
,
they
are
hired
by
ship
-
masters
to
bring
ballast
,
and
have
a
small
proportion
of
what
they
earn
,
for
their
own
use
:
the
rest
belongs
to
the
king
.
<EOS>
They
are
distinguished
by
an
iron
shackle
about
one
of
their
legs
.
<EOS>
The
road
from
Nice
to
Ville
Franche
is
scarce
passable
on
horseback
:
a
circumstance
the
more
extraordinary
,
as
those
slaves
,
in
the
space
of
two
or
three
months
,
might
even
make
it
fit
for
a
carriage
,
and
the
king
would
not
be
one
farthing
out
of
pocket
,
for
they
are
quite
idle
the
greatest
part
of
the
year
.
  
<EOS>
The
gallies
go
to
sea
only
in
the
summer
.
<EOS>
In
tempestuous
weather
,
they
could
not
live
out
of
port
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
they
are
good
for
nothing
but
in
smooth
water
during
a
calm
;
when
,
by
dint
of
rowing
,
they
make
good
way
.
<EOS>
The
king
of
Sardinia
is
so
sensible
of
their
inutility
,
that
he
intends
to
let
his
gallies
rot
;
and
,
in
lieu
of
them
,
has
purchased
two
large
frigates
in
England
,
one
of
fifty
,
and
another
of
thirty
guns
,
which
are
now
in
the
harbour
of
Ville
Franche
.
<EOS>
He
has
also
procured
an
English
officer
,
one
<EOS>
Mr
A
 
,
who
is
second
in
command
on
board
of
one
of
them
,
and
has
the
title
of
captain
consulteur
,
that
is
,
instructor
to
the
first
captain
,
the
marquis
de
M
 
i
,
who
knows
as
little
of
seamanship
as
I
do
of
Arabic
.
  
<EOS>
The
king
,
it
is
said
,
intends
to
have
two
or
three
more
frigates
,
and
then
he
will
be
more
than
a
match
for
the
Barbary
corsairs
,
provided
care
be
taken
to
man
his
fleet
in
a
proper
manner
:
but
this
will
never
be
done
,
unless
he
invites
foreigners
into
his
service
,
officers
as
well
as
seamen
;
for
his
own
dominions
produce
neither
at
present
.
<EOS>
If
he
is
really
determined
to
make
the
most
of
the
maritime
situation
of
his
dominions
,
as
well
as
of
his
alliance
with
Great
-
Britain
,
he
ought
to
supply
his
ships
with
English
mariners
,
and
put
a
British
commander
at
the
head
of
his
fleet
.
<EOS>
He
ought
to
erect
magazines
and
docks
at
Villa
Franca
;
or
if
there
is
not
conveniency
for
building
,
he
may
at
least
have
pits
and
wharfs
for
heaving
down
and
careening
;
and
these
ought
to
be
under
the
direction
of
Englishmen
,
who
best
understand
all
the
particulars
of
marine
oeconomy
.
<EOS>
Without
all
doubt
,
he
will
not
be
able
to
engage
foreigners
,
without
giving
them
liberal
appointments
;
and
their
being
engaged
in
his
service
will
give
umbrage
to
his
own
subjects
:
<EOS>
but
,
when
the
business
is
to
establish
a
maritime
power
,
these
considerations
ought
to
be
sacrificed
to
reasons
of
public
utility
.
<EOS>
Nothing
can
be
more
absurd
and
unreasonable
,
than
the
murmurs
of
the
Piedmontese
officers
at
the
preferment
of
foreigners
,
who
execute
those
things
for
the
advantage
of
their
country
,
of
which
they
know
themselves
incapable
.
<EOS>
When
Mr
P
 
n
was
first
promoted
in
the
service
of
his
Sardinian
majesty
,
he
met
with
great
opposition
,
and
numberless
mortifications
,
from
the
jealousy
of
the
Piedmontese
officers
,
and
was
obliged
to
hazard
his
life
in
many
rencounters
with
them
,
before
they
would
be
quiet
.
<EOS>
Being
a
man
of
uncommon
spirit
,
he
never
suffered
the
least
insult
or
affront
to
pass
unchastised
.
<EOS>
He
had
repeated
opportunities
of
signalizing
his
valour
against
the
Turks
;
and
by
dint
of
extraordinary
merit
,
and
long
services
not
only
attained
the
chief
command
of
the
gallies
,
with
the
rank
of
lieutenant
-
general
,
but
also
acquired
a
very
considerable
share
of
the
king
's
favour
,
and
was
appointed
commandant
of
Nice
.
<EOS>
His
Sardinian
majesty
found
his
account
more
ways
than
one
,
in
thus
promoting
Mr
P
 
<EOS>
n.
He
made
the
acquisition
of
an
excellent
officer
,
of
tried
courage
and
fidelity
,
by
whose
advice
he
conducted
his
marine
affairs
.
<EOS>
This
gentleman
was
perfectly
well
esteemed
at
the
court
of
London
.
<EOS>
In
the
war
of
1744
,
he
lived
in
the
utmost
harmony
with
the
British
admirals
who
commanded
our
fleet
in
the
Mediterranean
.
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
this
good
understanding
,
a
thousand
occasional
services
were
performed
by
the
English
ships
,
for
the
benefit
of
his
master
,
which
otherwise
could
not
have
been
done
,
without
a
formal
application
to
our
ministry
;
in
which
case
,
the
opportunities
would
have
been
lost
.
<EOS>
I
know
our
admirals
had
general
orders
and
instructions
,
to
cooperate
in
all
things
with
his
Sardinian
majesty
;
but
I
know
,
also
,
by
experience
,
how
little
these
general
instructions
avail
,
when
the
admiral
is
not
cordially
interested
in
the
service
.
<EOS>
Were
the
king
of
Sardinia
at
present
engaged
with
England
in
a
new
war
against
France
,
and
a
British
squadron
stationed
upon
this
coast
,
as
formerly
,
he
would
find
a
great
difference
in
this
particular
.
<EOS>
He
should
therefore
carefully
avoid
having
at
Nice
a
Savoyard
commandant
,
utterly
ignorant
of
sea
affairs
;
unacquainted
with
the
true
interest
of
his
master
;
proud
,
and
arbitrary
;
reserved
to
strangers
,
from
a
prejudice
of
national
jealousy
;
and
particularly
averse
to
the
English
.
  
<EOS>
With
respect
to
the
antient
name
of
Villa
Franca
,
there
is
a
dispute
among
antiquarians
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
at
all
mentioned
in
the
Itinerarium
of
Antoninus
,
unless
it
is
meant
as
the
port
of
Nice
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
more
surprising
,
that
the
accurate
Strabo
,
in
describing
this
coast
,
mentions
no
such
harbour
.
<EOS>
Some
people
imagine
it
is
the
Portus
Herculis
Monaeci
.
<EOS>
But
this
is
undoubtedly
what
is
now
called
Monaco
;
the
harbour
of
which
exactly
tallies
with
what
Strabo
says
of
the
Portus
Monaeci
  
neque
magnas
,
neque
multas
capit
naves
<EOS>
,
It
holds
but
<EOS>
a
few
vessels
and
those
of
small
burthen
.
<EOS>
Ptolomy
,
indeed
,
seems
to
mention
it
under
the
name
of
Herculis
Portus
,
different
from
the
Portus
Monaeci
.
<EOS>
His
words
are
these
:
post
vari
ostium
ad
Ligustrium
mare
,
massiliensium
,
sunt
Nicaea
,
Herculis
Portus
,
Trophaea
Augusti
,
Monaeci
Portus
,
<EOS>
Beyond
the
mouth
of
the
Var
upon
the
Ligurian
Coast
,
the
Marsilian
Colonies
are
Nice
,
Port
Hercules
,
Trophaea
and
Monaco
.
<EOS>
In
that
case
,
Hercules
was
worshipped
both
here
and
at
Monaco
,
and
gave
his
name
to
both
places
.
<EOS>
But
on
this
subject
,
I
shall
perhaps
speak
more
fully
in
another
letter
,
after
I
have
seen
the
Trophaea
Augusti
,
now
called
Tourbia
,
and
the
town
of
Monaco
,
which
last
is
about
three
leagues
from
Nice
.
<EOS>
Here
I
can
not
help
taking
notice
of
the
following
elegant
description
from
the
Pharsalia
,
which
seems
to
have
been
intended
for
this
very
harbour
.

The

by

were
removed
hither
from
another
town
,
situated
on
the
top
of
a
mountain
in
the
neighbourhood
,
which
those
pirates
had
destroyed
.
<EOS>
Some
ruins
of
the
old
town
are
still
extant
.
<EOS>
In
order
to
secure
the
harbour
still
more
effectually
,
Emanuel
Philibert
,
duke
of
Savoy
,
built
the
fort
in
the
beginning
of
the
last
century
,
together
with
the
mole
where
the
gallies
are
moored
.
<EOS>
As
I
said
before
,
Ville
Franche
is
built
on
the
face
of
a
barren
rock
,
washed
by
the
sea
;
and
there
is
not
an
acre
of
plain
ground
within
a
mile
of
it
.
<EOS>
In
summer
,
the
reflexion
of
the
sun
from
the
rocks
must
make
it
intolerably
hot
;
for
even
at
this
time
of
the
year
,
I
walked
myself
into
a
profuse
sweat
,
by
going
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
see
the
gallies
.
  
<EOS>
Pray
remember
me
to
our
friends
at
A
 
's
,
and
believe
me
to
be
ever
yours
.

NICE

<EOS>
MADAM
,
 
<EOS>
In
your
favour
which
I
received
by
Mr
M
 
l
,
you
remind
me
of
my
promise
,
to
communicate
the
remarks
I
have
still
to
make
on
the
French
nation
;
and
at
the
same
time
you
signify
your
opinion
,
that
I
am
too
severe
in
my
former
observations
.
<EOS>
You
even
hint
a
suspicion
,
that
this
severity
is
owing
to
some
personal
cause
of
resentment
;
but
,
I
protest
,
I
have
no
particular
cause
of
animosity
against
any
individual
of
that
country
.
<EOS>
I
have
neither
obligation
to
,
nor
quarrel
with
,
any
subject
of
France
;
and
when
I
meet
with
a
Frenchman
worthy
of
my
esteem
,
I
can
receive
him
into
my
friendship
with
as
much
cordiality
,
as
I
could
feel
for
any
fellow
-
citizen
of
the
same
merit
.
<EOS>
I
even
respect
the
nation
,
for
the
number
of
great
men
it
has
produced
in
all
arts
and
sciences
.
<EOS>
I
respect
the
French
officers
,
in
particular
,
for
their
gallantry
and
valour
;
and
especially
for
that
generous
humanity
which
they
exercise
towards
their
enemies
,
even
amidst
the
horrors
of
war
.
<EOS>
This
liberal
spirit
is
the
only
circumstance
of
antient
chivalry
,
which
I
think
was
worth
preserving
.
<EOS>
It
had
formerly
flourished
in
England
,
but
was
almost
extinguished
in
a
succession
of
civil
wars
,
which
are
always
productive
of
cruelty
and
rancour
.
<EOS>
It
was
Henry
IV
of
France
,
(
a
real
knight
errant
)
who
revived
it
in
Europe
.
<EOS>
He
possessed
that
greatness
of
mind
,
which
can
forgive
injuries
of
the
deepest
dye
:
and
as
he
had
also
the
faculty
of
distinguishing
characters
,
he
found
his
account
,
in
favouring
with
his
friendship
and
confidence
,
some
of
those
who
had
opposed
him
in
the
field
with
the
most
inveterate
perseverance
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
whether
he
did
more
service
to
mankind
in
general
,
by
reviving
the
practice
of
treating
his
prisoners
with
generosity
,
than
he
prejudiced
his
own
country
by
patronizing
the
absurd
and
pernicious
custom
of
duelling
,
and
establishing
a
punto
,
founded
in
diametrical
opposition
to
common
sense
and
humanity
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
often
heard
it
observed
,
that
a
French
officer
is
generally
an
agreeable
companion
when
he
is
turned
of
fifty
.
<EOS>
Without
all
doubt
,
by
that
time
,
the
fire
of
his
vivacity
,
which
makes
him
so
troublesome
in
his
youth
,
will
be
considerably
abated
,
and
in
other
respects
,
he
must
be
improved
by
his
experience
.
<EOS>
But
there
is
a
fundamental
error
in
the
first
principles
of
his
education
,
<EOS>
which
time
rather
confirms
than
removes
.
<EOS>
Early
prejudices
are
for
the
most
part
converted
into
habits
of
thinking
;
and
accordingly
you
will
find
the
old
officers
in
the
French
service
more
bigotted
than
their
juniors
,
to
the
punctilios
of
false
honour
.
  
<EOS>
A
lad
of
a
good
family
no
sooner
enters
into
the
service
,
than
he
thinks
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
shew
his
courage
in
a
rencontre
.
<EOS>
His
natural
vivacity
prompts
him
to
hazard
in
company
every
thing
that
comes
uppermost
,
without
any
respect
to
his
seniors
or
betters
;
and
ten
to
one
<EOS>
but
he
says
something
,
which
he
finds
it
necessary
to
maintain
with
his
sword
.
<EOS>
The
old
officer
,
instead
of
checking
his
petulance
,
either
by
rebuke
or
silent
disapprobation
,
seems
to
be
pleased
with
his
impertinence
,
and
encourages
every
sally
of
his
presumption
.
<EOS>
Should
a
quarrel
ensue
,
and
the
parties
go
out
,
he
makes
no
efforts
to
compromise
the
dispute
;
but
sits
with
a
pleasing
expectation
to
learn
the
issue
of
the
rencontre
.
<EOS>
If
the
young
man
is
wounded
,
he
kisses
him
with
transport
,
extols
his
bravery
,
puts
him
into
the
hands
of
the
surgeon
,
and
visits
him
with
great
tenderness
every
day
,
until
he
is
cured
.
<EOS>
If
he
is
killed
on
the
spot
,
he
shrugs
up
his
shoulders
 
says
,
quelle
dommage
!
<EOS>
c'etoit
un
amiable
enfant
!
<EOS>
ah
,
patience
!
<EOS>
What
pity
!
<EOS>
he
was
a
fine
Boy
!
<EOS>
It
ca
n't
be
helpt
!
<EOS>
and
in
three
hours
the
defunct
is
forgotten
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
in
France
,
duels
are
forbid
,
on
pain
of
death
:
but
this
law
is
easily
evaded
.
<EOS>
The
person
insulted
walks
out
;
the
antagonist
understands
the
hint
,
and
follows
him
into
the
street
,
where
they
justle
as
if
by
accident
,
draw
their
swords
,
and
one
of
them
is
either
killed
or
disabled
,
before
any
effectual
means
can
be
used
to
part
them
.
<EOS>
Whatever
may
be
the
issue
of
the
combat
,
the
magistrate
takes
no
cognizance
of
it
;
at
least
,
it
is
interpreted
into
an
accidental
rencounter
,
and
no
penalty
is
incurred
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
Thus
the
purpose
of
the
law
is
entirely
defeated
,
by
a
most
ridiculous
and
cruel
connivance
.
<EOS>
The
meerest
trifles
in
conversation
,
a
rash
word
,
a
distant
hint
,
even
a
look
or
smile
of
contempt
,
is
sufficient
to
produce
one
of
these
combats
;
but
injuries
of
a
deeper
dye
,
such
as
terms
of
reproach
,
the
lie
direct
,
a
blow
,
or
even
the
menace
of
a
blow
,
must
be
discussed
with
more
formality
.
<EOS>
In
any
of
these
cases
,
the
parties
agree
to
meet
in
the
dominions
of
another
prince
,
where
they
can
murder
each
other
,
without
fear
of
punishment
.
<EOS>
An
officer
who
is
struck
,
or
even
threatened
with
a
blow
must
not
be
quiet
,
until
he
either
kills
his
antagonist
,
or
loses
his
own
life
.
<EOS>
A
friend
of
mine
,
(
a
Nissard
)
who
was
in
the
service
of
France
,
told
me
,
that
some
years
ago
,
one
of
their
captains
,
in
the
heat
of
passion
,
struck
his
lieutenant
.
<EOS>
They
fought
immediately
:
the
lieutenant
was
wounded
and
disarmed
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
an
affront
that
could
not
be
made
up
,
he
no
sooner
recovered
of
his
wounds
,
than
he
called
out
the
captain
a
second
time
.
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
they
fought
five
times
before
the
combat
proved
decisive
at
last
,
the
lieutenant
was
left
dead
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
This
was
an
event
which
sufficiently
proved
the
absurdity
of
the
punctilio
that
gave
rise
to
it
.
<EOS>
The
poor
gentleman
who
was
insulted
,
and
outraged
by
the
brutality
of
the
aggressor
,
found
himself
under
the
necessity
of
giving
him
a
further
occasion
to
take
away
his
life
.
<EOS>
Another
adventure
of
the
same
kind
happened
a
few
years
ago
in
this
place
.
<EOS>
A
French
officer
having
threatened
to
strike
another
,
a
formal
challenge
ensued
;
and
it
being
agreed
that
they
should
fight
until
one
of
them
dropped
,
each
provided
himself
with
a
couple
of
pioneers
to
dig
his
grave
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
They
engaged
just
without
one
of
the
gates
of
Nice
,
in
presence
of
a
great
number
of
spectators
,
and
fought
with
surprising
fury
,
until
the
ground
was
drenched
with
their
blood
.
<EOS>
At
length
one
of
them
stumbled
,
and
fell
;
upon
which
the
other
,
who
found
himself
mortally
wounded
,
advancing
,
and
dropping
his
point
,
said
,
"
<EOS>
Je
te
donne
ce
que
tu
m'as
ote
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
'll
give
thee
that
which
thou
hast
taken
from
me
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
dropped
dead
upon
the
field
.
<EOS>
The
other
,
who
had
been
the
person
insulted
,
was
so
dangerously
wounded
that
he
could
not
rise
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
spectators
carried
him
forthwith
to
the
beach
,
and
putting
him
into
a
boat
,
conveyed
him
by
sea
to
Antibes
.
<EOS>
The
body
of
his
antagonist
was
denied
Christian
burial
,
as
he
died
without
absolution
,
and
every
body
allowed
that
his
soul
went
to
hell
:
but
the
gentlemen
of
the
army
declared
,
that
he
died
like
a
man
of
honour
.
<EOS>
Should
a
man
be
never
so
well
inclined
to
make
atonement
in
a
peaceable
manner
,
for
an
insult
given
in
the
heat
of
passion
,
or
in
the
fury
of
intoxication
,
it
can
not
be
received
.
<EOS>
Even
an
involuntary
trespass
from
ignorance
,
or
absence
of
mind
,
must
be
cleansed
with
blood
.
<EOS>
A
certain
noble
lord
,
of
our
country
,
when
he
was
yet
a
commoner
,
on
his
travels
,
involved
himself
in
a
dilemma
of
this
sort
,
at
the
court
of
Lorrain
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
riding
out
,
and
strolling
along
a
public
walk
,
in
a
brown
study
,
with
his
horse
-
whip
in
his
hand
,
perceived
a
caterpillar
crawling
on
the
back
of
a
marquis
,
who
chanced
to
be
before
him
.
<EOS>
He
never
thought
of
the
petit
maitre
;
but
lifting
up
his
whip
,
in
order
to
kill
the
insect
,
laid
it
across
his
shoulders
with
a
crack
,
that
alarmed
all
the
company
in
the
walk
.
<EOS>
The
marquis
's
sword
was
produced
in
a
moment
,
and
the
aggressor
in
great
hazard
of
his
life
,
as
he
had
no
weapon
of
defence
.
<EOS>
He
was
no
sooner
waked
from
his
reverie
,
than
he
begged
pardon
,
and
offered
to
make
all
proper
concessions
for
what
he
had
done
through
mere
inadvertency
.
<EOS>
The
marquis
would
have
admitted
his
excuses
,
had
there
been
any
precedent
of
such
an
affront
being
washed
away
without
blood
.
<EOS>
A
conclave
of
honour
was
immediately
assembled
;
and
after
long
disputes
,
they
agreed
,
that
an
involuntary
offence
,
especially
from
such
a
kind
of
man
,
d'un
tel
homme
,
might
be
attoned
by
concessions
.
<EOS>
That
you
may
have
some
idea
of
the
small
beginning
,
from
which
many
gigantic
quarrels
arise
,
I
shall
recount
one
that
lately
happened
at
Lyons
,
as
I
had
it
from
the
mouth
of
a
person
who
was
an
ear
and
eye
witness
of
the
transaction
.
<EOS>
Two
Frenchmen
,
at
a
public
ordinary
,
stunned
the
rest
of
the
company
with
their
loquacity
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
one
of
them
,
with
a
supercilious
air
,
asked
the
other
's
name
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
tell
my
name
,
(
said
he
)
but
in
a
whisper
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
may
have
very
good
reasons
for
keeping
it
secret
,
"
replied
the
first
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
,
"
(
resumed
the
other
)
:
with
these
words
he
rose
;
and
going
round
to
him
,
pronounced
,
loud
enough
to
be
heard
by
the
whole
company
,
"
Je
m'appelle
Pierre
Paysan
;
et
vous
etes
un
impertinent
.
"
<EOS>
"
My
name
is
Peter
Peasant
,
and
you
are
an
impertinent
fellow
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
walked
out
:
the
interrogator
followed
him
into
the
street
,
where
they
justled
,
drew
their
swords
,
and
engaged
.
<EOS>
He
who
asked
the
question
was
run
through
the
body
;
but
his
relations
were
so
powerful
,
that
the
victor
was
obliged
to
fly
his
country
,
was
tried
and
condemned
in
his
absence
;
his
goods
were
confiscated
;
his
wife
broke
her
heart
;
his
children
were
reduced
to
beggary
;
and
he
himself
is
now
starving
in
exile
.
<EOS>
In
England
we
have
not
yet
adopted
all
the
implacability
of
the
punctilio
.
<EOS>
A
gentleman
may
be
insulted
even
with
a
blow
,
and
survive
,
after
having
once
hazarded
his
life
against
the
aggressor
.
<EOS>
The
laws
of
honour
in
our
country
do
not
oblige
him
either
to
slay
the
person
from
whom
he
received
the
injury
,
or
even
to
fight
to
the
last
drop
of
his
own
blood
.
<EOS>
One
finds
no
examples
of
duels
among
the
Romans
,
who
were
certainly
as
brave
and
as
delicate
in
their
notions
of
honour
as
the
French
.
<EOS>
Cornelius
Nepos
tells
us
,
that
a
famous
Athenian
general
,
having
a
dispute
with
his
colleague
,
who
was
of
Sparta
,
a
man
of
a
fiery
disposition
,
this
last
lifted
up
his
cane
to
strike
him
.
<EOS>
Had
this
happened
to
a
French
petit
maitre
,
death
must
have
ensued
:
but
mark
what
followed
 
<EOS>
The
Athenian
,
far
from
resenting
the
outrage
,
in
what
is
now
called
a
gentlemanlike
manner
,
said
,
"
Do
,
strike
if
you
please
;
but
hear
me
.
"
<EOS>
He
never
dreamed
of
cutting
the
Lacedemonian
's
throat
;
but
bore
with
his
passionate
temper
,
as
the
infirmity
of
a
friend
who
had
a
thousand
good
qualities
to
overbalance
that
defect
.
  
<EOS>
I
need
not
expatiate
upon
the
folly
and
the
mischief
which
are
countenanced
and
promoted
by
the
modern
practice
of
duelling
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
give
examples
of
friends
who
have
murdered
each
other
,
in
obedience
to
this
savage
custom
,
even
while
their
hearts
were
melting
with
mutual
tenderness
;
nor
will
I
particularize
the
instances
which
I
myself
know
,
of
whole
families
ruined
,
of
women
and
children
made
widows
and
orphans
,
of
parents
deprived
of
only
sons
,
and
of
valuable
lives
lost
to
the
community
,
by
duels
,
which
had
been
produced
by
one
unguarded
expression
,
uttered
without
intention
of
offence
,
in
the
heat
of
dispute
and
altercation
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
insist
upon
the
hardship
of
a
worthy
man
's
being
obliged
to
devote
himself
to
death
,
because
it
is
his
misfortune
to
be
insulted
by
a
brute
,
a
bully
,
a
drunkard
,
or
a
madman
:
<EOS>
neither
will
I
enlarge
upon
this
side
of
the
absurdity
,
which
indeed
amounts
to
a
contradiction
in
terms
;
I
mean
the
dilemma
to
which
a
gentleman
in
the
army
is
reduced
,
when
he
receives
an
affront
:
if
he
does
not
challenge
and
fight
his
antagonist
,
he
is
broke
with
infamy
by
a
court
-
martial
;
if
he
fights
and
kills
him
,
he
is
tried
by
the
civil
power
,
convicted
of
murder
,
and
,
if
the
royal
mercy
does
not
interpose
,
he
is
infallibly
hanged
:
all
this
,
exclusive
of
the
risque
of
his
own
life
in
the
duel
,
and
his
conscience
being
burthened
with
the
blood
of
a
man
,
whom
perhaps
he
has
sacrificed
to
a
false
punctilio
,
even
contrary
to
his
own
judgment
.
<EOS>
These
are
reflections
which
I
know
your
own
good
sense
will
suggest
,
but
I
will
make
bold
to
propose
a
remedy
for
this
gigantic
evil
,
which
seems
to
gain
ground
everyday
:
let
a
court
be
instituted
for
taking
cognizance
of
all
breaches
of
honour
,
with
power
to
punish
by
fine
,
pillory
,
sentence
of
infamy
,
outlawry
,
and
exile
,
by
virtue
of
an
act
of
parliament
made
for
this
purpose
;
and
all
persons
insulted
,
shall
have
recourse
to
this
tribunal
:
let
every
man
who
seeks
personal
reparation
with
sword
,
pistol
,
or
other
instrument
of
death
,
be
declared
infamous
,
and
banished
the
kingdom
:
let
every
man
,
convicted
of
having
used
a
sword
or
pistol
,
or
other
mortal
weapon
,
against
another
,
either
in
duel
or
rencountre
,
occasioned
by
any
previous
quarrel
,
be
subject
to
the
same
penalties
:
if
any
man
is
killed
in
a
duel
,
let
his
body
be
hanged
upon
a
public
gibbet
,
for
a
certain
time
,
and
then
given
to
the
surgeons
:
let
his
antagonist
be
hanged
as
a
murderer
,
and
dissected
also
;
and
some
mark
of
infamy
be
set
on
the
memory
of
both
.
<EOS>
I
apprehend
such
regulations
would
put
an
effectual
stop
to
the
practice
of
duelling
,
which
nothing
but
the
fear
of
infamy
can
support
;
for
I
am
persuaded
,
that
no
being
,
capable
of
reflection
,
would
prosecute
the
trade
of
assassination
at
the
risque
of
his
own
life
,
if
this
hazard
was
at
the
same
time
reinforced
by
the
certain
prospect
of
infamy
and
ruin
.
<EOS>
Every
person
of
sentiment
would
in
that
case
allow
,
that
an
officer
,
who
in
a
duel
robs
a
deserving
woman
of
her
husband
,
a
number
of
children
of
their
father
,
a
family
of
its
support
,
and
the
community
of
a
fellow
-
citizen
,
has
as
little
merit
to
plead
from
exposing
his
own
person
,
as
a
highwayman
,
or
housebreaker
,
who
every
day
risques
his
life
to
rob
or
plunder
that
which
is
not
of
half
the
importance
to
society
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
was
from
the
Buccaneers
of
America
,
that
the
English
have
learned
to
abolish
one
solecism
in
the
practice
of
duelling
:
those
adventurers
decided
their
personal
quarrels
with
pistols
;
and
this
improvement
has
been
adopted
in
Great
Britain
with
good
success
;
though
in
France
,
and
other
parts
of
the
continent
,
it
is
looked
upon
as
a
proof
of
their
barbarity
.
<EOS>
It
is
,
however
,
the
only
circumstance
of
duelling
,
which
savours
of
common
sense
,
as
it
puts
all
mankind
upon
a
level
,
the
old
with
the
young
,
the
weak
with
the
strong
,
the
unwieldy
with
the
nimble
,
and
the
man
who
knows
not
how
to
hold
a
sword
with
the
spadassin
,
who
has
practised
fencing
from
the
cradle
.
<EOS>
What
glory
is
there
in
a
man
's
vanquishing
an
adversary
over
whom
he
has
a
manifest
advantage
?
<EOS>
To
abide
the
issue
of
a
combat
in
this
case
,
does
not
even
require
that
moderate
share
of
resolution
which
nature
has
indulged
to
her
common
children
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
we
have
seen
many
instances
of
a
coward
's
provoking
a
man
of
honour
to
battle
.
<EOS>
In
the
reign
of
our
second
Charles
,
when
duels
flourished
in
all
their
absurdity
,
and
the
seconds
fought
while
their
principals
were
engaged
,
Villiers
,
Duke
of
Buckingham
,
not
content
with
having
debauched
the
countess
of
Shrewsbury
and
publishing
her
shame
,
took
all
opportunities
of
provoking
the
earl
to
single
combat
,
hoping
he
should
have
an
easy
conquest
,
his
lordship
being
a
puny
little
creature
,
quiet
,
inoffensive
,
and
<EOS>
every
way
unfit
for
such
personal
contests
.
<EOS>
He
ridiculed
him
on
all
occasions
;
and
at
last
declared
in
public
company
,
that
there
was
no
glory
in
cuckolding
Shrewsbury
,
who
had
not
spirit
to
resent
the
injury
.
<EOS>
This
was
an
insult
which
could
not
be
overlooked
.
<EOS>
The
earl
sent
him
a
challenge
;
and
they
agreed
to
fight
,
at
Barns
-
Elms
,
in
presence
of
two
gentlemen
,
whom
they
chose
for
their
seconds
.
<EOS>
All
the
four
engaged
at
the
same
time
;
the
first
thrust
was
fatal
to
the
earl
of
Shrewsbury
;
and
his
friend
killed
the
duke
's
second
at
the
same
instant
.
<EOS>
Buckingham
,
elated
with
his
exploit
,
set
out
immediately
for
the
earl
's
seat
at
Cliefden
,
where
he
lay
with
his
wife
,
after
having
boasted
of
the
murder
of
her
husband
,
whose
blood
he
shewed
her
upon
his
sword
,
as
a
trophy
of
his
prowess
.
<EOS>
But
this
very
duke
of
Buckingham
was
little
better
than
a
poltroon
at
bottom
.
<EOS>
When
the
gallant
earl
of
Ossory
challenged
him
to
fight
in
Chelsea
fields
,
he
crossed
the
water
to
Battersea
,
where
he
pretended
to
wait
for
his
lordship
;
and
then
complained
to
the
house
of
lords
,
that
Ossory
had
given
him
the
rendezvous
,
and
did
not
keep
his
appointment
.
<EOS>
He
knew
the
house
would
interpose
in
the
quarrel
,
and
he
was
not
disappointed
.
<EOS>
Their
lordships
obliged
them
both
to
give
their
word
of
honour
,
that
their
quarrel
should
have
no
other
consequences
.
  
<EOS>
I
ought
to
make
an
apology
for
having
troubled
a
lady
with
so
many
observations
on
a
subject
so
unsuitable
to
the
softness
of
the
fair
sex
;
but
I
know
you
can
not
be
indifferent
to
any
thing
that
so
nearly
affects
the
interests
of
humanity
,
which
I
can
safely
aver
<EOS>
have
alone
suggested
every
thing
which
has
been
said
by
,
Madam

Your
very
humble
servant

NICE

May

<EOS>
DEAR
DOCTOR
,
 
A
few
days
ago
,
I
rode
out
with
two
gentlemen
of
this
country
,
to
see
a
stream
of
water
which
was
formerly
conveyed
in
an
aqueduct
to
the
antient
city
of
Cemenelion
,
from
whence
this
place
is
distant
about
a
mile
,
though
separated
by
abrupt
rocks
and
deep
hollows
,
which
last
are
here
honoured
with
the
name
of
vallies
.
<EOS>
The
water
,
which
is
exquisitely
cool
,
and
light
and
pure
,
gushes
from
the
middle
of
a
rock
by
a
hole
which
leads
to
a
subterranean
aqueduct
carried
through
the
middle
of
the
mountain
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
Roman
work
,
and
the
more
I
considered
it
,
appeared
the
more
stupendous
.
<EOS>
A
peasant
who
lives
upon
the
spot
told
us
,
he
had
entered
by
this
hole
at
eight
in
the
morning
,
and
advanced
so
far
,
that
it
was
four
in
the
afternoon
before
he
came
out
.
<EOS>
He
said
he
walked
in
the
water
,
through
a
regular
canal
formed
of
a
hard
stone
,
lined
with
a
kind
of
cement
,
and
vaulted
overhead
;
but
so
high
in
most
parts
he
could
stand
upright
,
yet
in
others
,
the
bed
of
the
canal
was
so
filled
with
earth
and
stones
,
that
he
was
obliged
to
stoop
in
passing
.
<EOS>
He
said
that
there
were
air
-
holes
at
certain
distances
(
and
indeed
I
saw
one
of
these
not
far
from
the
present
issue
)
that
there
were
some
openings
and
stone
seats
on
the
sides
,
and
here
<EOS>
and
there
figures
of
men
formed
of
stone
,
with
hammers
and
working
tools
in
their
hands
.
<EOS>
I
am
apt
to
believe
the
fellow
romanced
a
little
,
in
order
to
render
his
adventure
the
more
marvellous
:
but
I
am
certainly
informed
,
that
several
persons
have
entered
this
passage
,
and
proceeded
a
considerable
way
by
the
light
of
torches
,
without
arriving
at
the
source
,
which
(
if
we
may
believe
the
tradition
of
the
country
)
is
at
the
distance
of
eight
leagues
from
this
opening
;
but
this
is
altogether
incredible
.
<EOS>
The
stream
is
now
called
la
fontaine
de
muraille
,
and
is
carefully
conducted
by
different
branches
into
the
adjacent
vineyards
and
gardens
,
for
watering
the
ground
.
<EOS>
On
the
side
of
the
same
mountain
,
more
southerly
,
at
the
distance
of
half
a
mile
,
there
is
another
still
more
copious
discharge
of
the
same
kind
of
water
,
called
la
source
du
temple
.
<EOS>
It
was
conveyed
through
the
same
kind
of
passage
,
and
put
to
the
same
use
as
the
other
;
and
I
should
imagine
they
are
both
from
the
same
source
,
which
,
though
hitherto
undiscovered
,
must
be
at
a
considerable
distance
,
as
the
mountain
is
continued
for
several
leagues
to
the
westward
,
without
exhibiting
the
least
signs
of
water
in
any
other
part
.
<EOS>
But
,
exclusive
of
the
subterranean
conduits
,
both
these
streams
must
have
been
conveyed
through
aqueducts
extending
from
hence
to
Cemenelion
over
steep
rocks
and
deep
ravines
,
at
a
prodigious
expence
.
<EOS>
The
water
from
this
source
du
temple
,
issues
from
a
stone
building
which
covers
the
passage
in
the
rock
.
<EOS>
It
serves
to
turn
several
olive
,
corn
,
and
paper
mills
,
being
conveyed
through
a
modern
aqueduct
raised
upon
paultry
arcades
at
the
expence
of
the
public
,
and
afterwards
is
branched
off
in
very
small
streams
,
for
the
benefit
of
this
parched
and
barren
country
.
<EOS>
The
Romans
were
so
used
to
bathing
,
that
they
could
not
exist
without
a
great
quantity
of
water
;
and
this
<EOS>
,
I
imagine
,
is
one
reason
that
induced
them
to
spare
no
labour
and
expence
in
bringing
it
from
a
distance
,
when
they
had
not
plenty
of
it
at
home
.
<EOS>
But
,
besides
this
motive
,
they
had
another
:
they
were
so
nice
and
delicate
in
their
taste
of
water
,
that
they
took
great
pains
to
supply
themselves
with
the
purest
and
lightest
from
afar
,
for
drinking
and
culinary
uses
,
even
while
they
had
plenty
of
an
inferior
sort
for
their
bath
,
and
other
domestic
purposes
.
<EOS>
There
are
springs
of
good
water
on
the
spot
where
Cemenelion
stood
:
but
there
is
a
hardness
in
all
well
-
water
,
which
quality
is
deposited
in
running
a
long
course
,
especially
,
if
exposed
to
the
influence
of
the
sun
and
air
.
<EOS>
The
Romans
,
therefore
,
had
good
reason
to
soften
and
meliorate
this
element
,
by
conveying
it
a
good
length
of
way
in
open
aqueducts
.
<EOS>
What
was
used
in
the
baths
of
Cemenelion
,
they
probably
brought
in
leaden
pipes
,
some
of
which
have
been
dug
up
very
lately
by
accident
.
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
I
made
a
second
excursion
to
these
antient
ruins
,
and
measured
the
arena
of
the
amphitheatre
with
packthread
.
<EOS>
It
is
an
oval
figure
;
the
longest
diameter
extending
to
about
one
hundred
and
thirteen
feet
,
and
the
shortest
to
eighty
-
eight
;
but
I
will
not
answer
for
the
exactness
of
the
measurement
.
<EOS>
In
the
center
of
it
,
there
was
a
square
stone
,
with
an
iron
ring
,
to
which
I
suppose
the
wild
beasts
were
tied
,
to
prevent
their
springing
upon
the
spectators
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
seats
remain
,
the
two
opposite
entrances
,
consisting
each
of
one
large
gate
,
and
two
lateral
smaller
doors
,
arched
:
there
is
also
a
considerable
portion
of
the
external
wall
;
but
no
columns
,
or
other
ornaments
of
architecture
.
<EOS>
Hard
by
,
in
the
garden
of
the
count
de
Gubernatis
,
I
saw
the
remains
of
a
bath
,
fronting
the
portal
of
the
temple
,
which
I
have
described
in
a
former
letter
;
and
here
were
some
shafts
of
marble
pillars
,
particularly
a
capital
of
the
Corinthian
order
beautifully
cut
,
of
white
alabaster
.
<EOS>
Here
the
count
found
a
large
quantity
of
fine
marble
,
which
he
has
converted
to
various
uses
;
and
some
mutilated
statues
,
bronze
as
well
as
marble
.
<EOS>
The
peasant
shewed
me
some
brass
and
silver
medals
,
which
he
has
picked
up
at
different
times
in
labouring
the
ground
;
together
with
several
oblong
beads
of
coloured
glass
,
which
were
used
as
ear
-
rings
by
the
Roman
ladies
;
and
a
small
seal
of
agate
,
very
much
defaced
.
<EOS>
Two
of
the
medals
were
of
Maximian
and
Gallienus
;
the
rest
were
so
consumed
,
that
I
could
not
read
the
legend
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
that
on
public
occasions
,
such
as
games
,
and
certain
sacrifices
,
handfuls
of
medals
were
thrown
among
the
people
;
a
practice
,
which
accounts
for
the
great
number
which
have
been
already
found
in
this
district
.
<EOS>
I
saw
some
subterranean
passages
,
which
seemed
to
have
been
common
sewers
;
and
a
great
number
of
old
walls
still
standing
along
the
brink
of
a
precipice
,
which
overhangs
the
Paglion
.
<EOS>
The
peasants
tell
me
,
that
they
never
dig
above
a
yard
in
depth
,
without
finding
vaults
or
cavities
.
<EOS>
All
the
vineyards
and
garden
-
grounds
,
for
a
considerable
extent
,
are
vaulted
underneath
;
and
all
the
ground
that
produces
their
grapes
,
fruit
,
and
garden
-
stuff
,
is
no
more
than
the
crumpled
lime
and
rubbish
of
old
Roman
buildings
,
mixed
with
manure
brought
from
Nice
.
<EOS>
This
antient
town
commanded
a
most
noble
prospect
of
the
sea
;
but
is
altogether
inaccessible
by
any
kind
of
wheel
carriage
.
<EOS>
If
you
make
shift
to
climb
to
it
on
horseback
,
you
can
not
descend
to
the
plain
again
,
without
running
the
risk
of
breaking
your
neck
.
  
<EOS>
About
seven
or
eight
miles
on
the
other
side
of
Nice
,
are
the
remains
of
another
Roman
monument
which
has
greatly
suffered
from
the
barbarity
of
successive
ages
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
trophy
erected
by
the
senate
of
Rome
,
in
honour
of
Augustus
Caesar
,
when
he
had
totally
subdued
all
the
ferocious
nations
of
these
Maritime
Alps
;
such
as
the
Trumpilini
Camuni
,
Vennontes
,
Isnarci
,
Breuni
,
etc
.
<EOS>
It
stands
upon
the
top
of
a
mountain
which
overlooks
the
town
of
Monaco
,
and
now
exhibits
the
appearance
of
an
old
ruined
tower
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
description

is

it

in

words

This
Trophy
is
erected
by
the
Senate
and
People
of
Rome
to
the
Emperor
Caesar
Augustus
,
son
of
the
divine
Julius
,
in
the
fourteenth
year
of
his
imperial
Dignity
,
and
in
the
eighteenth
of
his
Tribunician
Power
,
because
under
his
command
and
auspices
all
the
nations
of
the
Alps
from
the
Adriatic
to
the
Tuscanian
Sea
,
were
reduced
under
the
Dominion
of
Rome
.
<EOS>
The
Alpine
nations
subdued
were
the
Trumpelini
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
Pliny
,
however
,
is
mistaken
in
placing
this
inscription
on
a
trophy
near
the
Augusta
praetoria
,
now
called
Aosta
,
in
Piedmont
:
where
,
indeed
,
there
is
a
triumphal
arch
,
but
no
inscription
.
<EOS>
This
noble
monument
of
antiquity
was
first
of
all
destroyed
by
fire
;
and
afterwards
,
in
Gothic
times
,
converted
into
a
kind
of
fortification
.
<EOS>
The
marbles
belonging
to
it
were
either
employed
in
adorning
the
church
of
the
adjoining
village
,
which
is
still
called
Turbia
,
a
corruption
of
Trophaea
;
[
This
was
formerly
a
considerable
town
called
Villa
Martis
,
and
pretends
to
the
honour
of
having
given
birth
to
Aulus
Helvius
,
who
succeeded
Commodus
as
emperor
of
Rome
,
by
the
name
of
Pertinax
which
he
acquired
from
his
obstinate
refusal
of
that
dignity
,
when
it
was
forced
upon
him
by
the
senate
.
<EOS>
You
know
this
man
,
though
of
very
low
birth
,
possessed
many
excellent
qualities
,
and
was
basely
murdered
by
the
praetorian
guards
,
at
the
instigation
of
Didius
Tulianus
.
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
I
could
never
read
without
emotion
,
that
celebrated
eulogium
of
the
senate
who
exclaimed
after
his
death
,
Pertinace
,
imperante

securi
viximus

patre
pio

churches
of
Nice

<EOS>
At
present
,
the
work
has
the
appearance
of
a
ruinous
watch
-
tower
,
with
Gothic
battlements
;
and
as
such
stands
undistinguished
by
those
who
travel
by
sea
from
hence
to
Genoa
,
and

ports
of
Italy
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
now
described
all
the
antiquities
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Nice
,
except
some
catacombs
or
caverns
,
dug
in
a
rock
at
St
Hospice
,
which
Busching
,
in
his
geography
,
has
described
as
a
strong
town
and
seaport
,
though
in
fact
,
there
is
not
the
least
vestige
either
of
town
or
village
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
point
of
land
almost
opposite
to
the
tower
of
Turbia
,
with
the
mountains
of
which
it
forms
a
bay
,
where
there
is
a
great
and
curious
fishery
of
the
tunny
fish
,
farmed
of
the
king
of
Sardinia
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
point
there
is
a
watch
-
tower
still
kept
in
repair
,
to
give
notice
to
the
people
in
the
neighbourhood
,
in
case
any
Barbary
corsairs
should
appear
on
the
coast
.
<EOS>
The
catacombs
were
in
all
probability
dug
,
in
former
times
,
as
places
of
retreat
for
the
inhabitants
upon
sudden
descents
of
the
Saracens
,
who
greatly
infested
these
seas
for
several
successive
centuries
.
<EOS>
Many
curious
persons
have
entered
them
and
proceeded
a
considerable
way
by
torch
-
light
,
without
arriving
at
the
further
extremity
;
and
the
tradition
of
the
country
is
,
that
they
reach
as
far
as
the
ancient
city
of
Cemenelion
;
but
this
is
an
idle
supposition
,
almost
as
ridiculous
as
that
which
ascribes
them
to
the
labour
and
ingenuity
of
the
fairies
:
they
consist
of
narrow
subterranean
passages
,
vaulted
with
stone
and
lined
with
cement
.
<EOS>
Here
and
there
one
finds
detached
apartments
like
small
chambers
,
where
I
suppose
the
people
remained
concealed
till
the
danger
was
over
.
<EOS>
Diodorus
Siculus
tells
us
,
that
the
antient
inhabitants
of
this
country
usually
lived
under
ground
.
<EOS>
"
Ligures
in
terra
cubant
ut
plurimum

plures

cava
,

"
"
The
Ligurians
mostly
lie
on
the
bare

;
many
of

bare
Caves
and
Caverns
where
they
are
sheltered
from
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
.
<EOS>
"
This
was
likewise
the
custom
of
the
Troglodytae
,
a
people
bordering
upon
Aethiopia
who
,
according
to
Aelian
,
lived
in
subterranean
caverns
;
from
whence
,
indeed
they
took
their
name
trogli
,
signifying
a
cavern
;
and
Virgil
,
in
his
Georgics

thus
describes
the

they
lie

transient
seasons

are
dry
subjects
;
but
such
as
the
country
affords
.
<EOS>
If
we
have
not
white
paper
,
we
must
snow
with
brown
.
<EOS>
Even
that
which
I
am
now
scrawling
may
be
useful

not
entertaining

it
is
therefore
the
more
confidently
offered

Dear

<EOS>
NICE
,
July
2
,
1764
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
Nice
was
originally
a
colony
from
Marseilles
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
Phocians
(
if
we
may
believe
Justin
and
Polybius
)
settled
in
Gaul
,
and
built
Marseilles
,
during
the
reign
of
Tarquinius
Priscus
at
Rome
.
<EOS>
This
city
flourished
to
such
a
degree
,
that
long
before
the
Romans
were
in
a
condition
to
extend
their
dominion
,
it
sent
forth
colonies
,
and
established
them
along
the
coast
of
Liguria
.
<EOS>
Of
these
,
Nice
,
or
Nicaea
,
was
one
of
the
most
remarkable
;
so
called
,
in
all
probability
,
from
the
Greek
word
Nike
,
signifying
Victoria
,
in
consequence
of
some
important
victory
obtained
over
the
Salii
and
Ligures
,
who
were
the
antient
inhabitants
of
this
country
.
<EOS>
Nice
,
with
its
mother
city
,
being
in
the
sequel
subdued
by
the
Romans
,
fell
afterwards
successively
under
the
dominion
of
the
Goths
,
Burgundians
,
and
Franks
,
the
kings
of
Arles
,
and
the
kings
of
Naples
,
as
counts
of
Provence
.
<EOS>
In
the
year
one
thousand
three
hundred
and
eighty
-
eight
,
the
city
and
county
of
Nice
being
but
ill
protected
by
the
family
of
Durazzo
,
voluntarily
surrendered
themselves
to
Amadaeus
,
surnamed
the
Red
,
duke
of
Savoy
;
and
since
that
period
,
they
have
continued
as
part
of
that
potentate
's
dominions
,
except
at
such
times
as
they
have
been
over
-
run
and
possessed
by
the
power
of
France
,
which
hath
always
been
a
troublesome
neighbour
to
this
country
.
<EOS>
The
castle
was
begun
by
the
Arragonian
counts
of
Provence
,
and
afterwards
enlarged
by
several
successive
dukes
of
Savoy
,
so
as
to
be
deemed
impregnable
,
until
the
modern
method
of
besieging
began
to
take
place
.
<EOS>
A
fruitless
attempt
was
made
upon
it
in
the
year
one
thousand
five
hundred
and
forty
-
three
,
by
the
French
and
Turks
in
conjunction
:
but
it
was
reduced
several
times
after
that
period
,
and
is
now
in
ruins
.
<EOS>
The
celebrated
engineer
Vauban
,
being
commanded
by
Louis
XIV
to
give
in
a
plan
for
fortifying
Nice
,
proposed
,
that
the
river
Paglion
should
be
turned
into
a
new
channel
,
so
as
to
surround
the
town
to
the
north
,
and
fall
into
the
harbour
;
that
where
the
Paglion
now
runs
to
the
westward
of
the
city
walls
,
there
should
be
a
deep
ditch
to
be
filled
with
sea
-
water
;
and
that
a
fortress
should
be
built
to
the
westward
of
this
fosse
.
<EOS>
These
particulars
might
be
executed
at
no
very
great
expence
;
but
,
I
apprehend
,
they
would
be
ineffectual
,
as
the
town
is
commanded
by
every
hill
in
the
neighbourhood
;
and
the
exhalations
from
stagnating
sea
-
water
would
infallibly
render
the
air
unwholesome
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
undoubted
antiquity
of
Nice
,
very
few
monuments
of
that
antiquity
now
remain
.
<EOS>
The
inhabitants
say
,
they
were
either
destroyed
by
the
Saracens
in
their
successive
descents
upon
the
coast
,
by
the
barbarous
nations
in
their
repeated
incursions
,
or
used
in
fortifying
the
castle
,
as
well
as
in
building
other
edifices
.
<EOS>
The
city
of
Cemenelion
,
however
,
was
subject
to
the
same
disasters
,
and
even
entirely
ruined
,
nevertheless
,
we
still
find
remains
of
its
antient
splendor
.
<EOS>
There
have
been
likewise
a
few
stones
found
at
Nice
,
with
antient
inscriptions
;
but
there
is
nothing
of
this
kind
standing
,
unless
we
give
the
name
of
antiquity
to
a
marble
cross
on
the
road
to
Provence
,
about
half
a
mile
from
the
city
.
<EOS>
It
stands
upon
a
pretty
high
pedestal
with
steps
,
under
a
pretty
stone
cupola
or
dome
,
supported
by
four
Ionic
pillars
,
on
the
spot
where
Charles
V
emperor
of
Germany
,
Francis
I
*
of
France
,
and
pope
Paul
II
agreed
to
have
a
conference
,
in
order
to
determine
all
their
disputes
.
<EOS>
The
emperor
came
hither
by
sea
,
with
a
powerful
fleet
,
and
the
French
king
by
land
,
at
the
head
of
a
numerous
army
.
<EOS>
All
the
endeavours
of
his
holiness
,
however
,
could
not
effect
a
peace
;
but
they
agreed
to
a
truce
of
ten
years
.
<EOS>
Mezerai
affirms
,
that
these
two
great
princes
never
saw
one
another
on
this
occasion
;
and
that
this
shyness
was
owing
to
the
management
of
the
pope
,
whose
private
designs
might
have
been
frustrated
,
<EOS>
had
they
come
to
a
personal
interview
.
<EOS>
In
the
front
of
the
colonade
,
there
is
a
small
stone
,
with
an
inscription
in
Latin
,
which
is
so
high
,
and
so
much
defaced
,
that
I
can
not
read
it
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
sixteenth
century
there
was
a
college
erected
at
Nice
,
by
Emanuel
Philibert
,
duke
of
Savoy
,
for
granting
degrees
to
students
of
law
;
and
in
the
year
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
fourteen
,
Charles
Emanuel
<EOS>
I
instituted
the
senate
of
Nice
;
consisting
of
a
president
,
and
a
certain
number
of
senators
,
who
are
distinguished
by
their
purple
robes
,
and
other
ensigns
of
authority
.
<EOS>
They
administer
justice
,
having
the
power
of
life
and
death
,
not
only
through
the
whole
county
of
Nice
,
but
causes
are
evoked
from
Oneglia
,
and
some
other
places
,
to
their
tribunal
,
which
is
the
dernier
ressort
,
from
whence
there
is
no
appeal
.
<EOS>
The
commandant
,
however
,
by
virtue
of
his
military
power
and
unrestricted
authority
,
takes
upon
him
to
punish
individuals
by
imprisonment
,
corporal
pains
,
and
banishment
,
without
consulting
the
senate
,
or
indeed
,
observing
any
form
of
trial
.
<EOS>
The
only
redress
against
any
unjust
exercise
of
this
absolute
power
,
is
by
complaint
to
the
king
;
and
you
know
,
what
chance
a
poor
man
has
for
being
redressed
in
this
manner
.
  
<EOS>
With
respect
to
religion
,
I
may
safely
say
,
that
here
superstition
reigns
under
the
darkest
shades
of
ignorance
and
prejudice
.
<EOS>
I
think
there
are
ten
convents
and
three
nunneries
within
and
without
the
walls
of
Nice
;
and
among
them
all
,
I
never
could
hear
of
one
man
who
had
made
any
tolerable
advances
in
any
kind
of
human
learning
.
<EOS>
All
ecclesiastics
are
exempted
from
any
exertion
of
civil
power
,
being
under
the
immediate
protection
and
authority
of
the
bishop
,
or
his
vicar
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
of
Nice
is
suffragan
of
the
archbishop
of
Ambrun
in
France
;
and
the
revenues
of
the
see
amount
to
between
five
and
six
hundred
pounds
sterling
.
<EOS>
We
have
likewise
an
office
of
the
inquisition
,
though
I
do
not
hear
that
it
presumes
to
execute
any
acts
of
jurisdiction
,
without
the
king
's
special
permission
.
<EOS>
All
the
churches
are
sanctuaries
for
all
kinds
of
criminals
,
except
those
guilty
of
high
treason
;
and
the
priests
are
extremely
jealous
of
their
privileges
in
this
particular
.
<EOS>
They
receive
,
with
open
arms
,
murderers
,
robbers
,
smugglers
,
fraudulent
bankrupts
,
and
felons
of
every
denomination
;
and
never
give
them
up
,
until
after
having
stipulated
for
their
lives
and
liberty
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
enlarge
upon
the
pernicious
consequences
of
this
infamous
prerogative
,
calculated
to
raise
and
extend
the
power
and
influence
of
the
Roman
church
,
on
the
ruins
of
morality
and
good
order
.
<EOS>
I
saw
a
fellow
,
who
had
three
days
before
murdered
his
wife
in
the
last
month
of
pregnancy
,
taking
the
air
with
great
composure
and
serenity
,
on
the
steps
of
a
church
in
Florence
;
and
nothing
is
more
common
,
than
to
see
the
most
execrable
villains
diverting
themselves
in
the
cloysters
of
some
convents
at
Rome
.
  
<EOS>
Nice
abounds
with
noblesse
,
marquisses
,
counts
,
and
barons
.
<EOS>
Of
these
,
three
or
four
families
are
really
respectable
:
the
rest
are
novi
homines
,
sprung
from
Bourgeois
,
who
have
saved
a
little
money
by
their
different
occupations
,
and
raised
themselves
to
the
rank
of
noblesse
by
purchase
.
<EOS>
One
is
descended
from
an
avocat
;
another
from
an
apothecary
;
a
third
from
a
retailer
of
wine
,
a
fourth
from
a
dealer
in
anchovies
;
and
I
am
told
,
there
is
actually
a
count
at
Villefranche
,
whose
father
sold
macaroni
in
the
streets
.
<EOS>
A
man
in
this
country
may
buy
a
marquisate
,
or
a
county
,
for
the
value
of
three
or
four
hundred
pounds
sterling
,
and
the
title
follows
the
fief
;
but
he
may
purchase
lettres
de
noblesse
for
about
thirty
or
forty
guineas
.
<EOS>
In
Savoy
,
there
are
six
hundred
families
of
noblesse
;
the
greater
part
of
which
have
not
above
one
hundred
crowns
a
year
to
maintain
their
dignity
.
<EOS>
In
the
mountains
of
Piedmont
,
and
even
in
this
country
of
Nice
,
there
are
some
representatives
of
very
antient
and
noble
families
,
reduced
to
the
condition
of
common
peasants
;
but
they
still
retain
the
antient
pride
of
their
houses
,
and
boast
of
the
noble
blood
that
runs
in
their
veins
.
<EOS>
A
gentleman
told
me
,
that
in
travelling
through
the
mountains
,
he
was
obliged
to
pass
a
night
in
the
cottage
of
one
of
these
rusticated
nobles
,
who
called
to
his
son
in
the
evening
,
"
Chevalier
,
as
-
tu
donne
a
manger
aux
cochons
?
"
<EOS>
"
Have
you
fed
the
Hogs
,
Sir
Knight
?
<EOS>
"
This
,
however
,
is
not
the
case
with
the
noblesse
of
Nice
.
<EOS>
Two
or
three
of
them
have
about
four
or
five
hundred
a
year
:
the
rest
,
in
general
,
may
have
about
one
hundred
pistoles
,
arising
from
the
silk
,
oil
,
wine
,
and
oranges
,
produced
in
their
small
plantations
,
where
they
have
also
country
houses
.
<EOS>
Some
few
of
these
are
well
built
,
commodious
,
and
situated
;
but
,
for
the
most
part
,
they
are
miserable
enough
.
<EOS>
Our
noblesse
,
notwithstanding
their
origin
,
and
the
cheap
rate
at
which
their
titles
have
been
obtained
,
are
nevertheless
extremely
tenacious
of
their
privileges
,
very
delicate
in
maintaining
the
etiquette
,
and
keep
at
a
very
stately
distance
from
the
Bourgeoisie
.
<EOS>
How
they
live
in
their
families
,
I
do
not
choose
to
enquire
;
but
,
in
public
,
Madame
appears
in
her
robe
of
gold
,
or
silver
stuff
,
with
her
powder
and
frisure
,
her
perfumes
,
her
paint
and
her
patches
;
while
Monsieur
Le
Comte
struts
about
in
his
lace
and
embroidery
.
<EOS>
Rouge
and
fard
are
more
peculiarly
necessary
in
this
country
,
where
the
complexion
and
skin
are
naturally
swarthy
and
yellow
.
<EOS>
I
have
likewise
observed
,
that
most
of
the
females
are
pot
-
bellied
;
a
circumstance
owing
,
I
believe
,
to
the
great
quantity
of
vegetable
trash
which
they
eat
.
<EOS>
All
the
horses
,
mules
,
asses
,
and
cattle
,
which
feed
upon
grass
,
have
the
same
distension
.
<EOS>
This
kind
of
food
produces
such
acid
juices
in
the
stomach
,
as
excite
a
perpetual
sense
of
hunger
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
often
amazed
at
the
voracious
appetites
of
these
people
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
expect
that
I
should
describe
the
tables
and
the
hospitality
of
our
Nissard
gentry
.
<EOS>
Our
consul
,
who
is
a
very
honest
man
,
told
me
,
he
had
lived
four
and
thirty
years
in
the
country
,
without
having
once
eat
or
drank
in
any
of
their
houses
.
  
<EOS>
The
noblesse
of
Nice
can
not
leave
the
country
without
express
leave
from
the
king
;
and
this
leave
,
when
obtained
,
is
for
a
limited
time
,
which
they
dare
not
exceed
,
on
pain
of
incurring
his
majesty
's
displeasure
.
<EOS>
They
must
,
therefore
,
endeavour
to
find
amusements
at
home
;
and
this
<EOS>
,
I
apprehend
,
would
be
no
easy
task
for
people
of
an
active
spirit
or
restless
disposition
.
<EOS>
True
it
is
,
the
religion
of
the
country
supplies
a
never
-
failing
fund
of
pastime
to
those
who
have
any
relish
for
devotion
;
and
this
is
here
a
prevailing
taste
.
<EOS>
We
have
had
transient
visits
of
a
puppet
-
shew
,
strolling
musicians
,
and
rope
-
dancers
;
but
they
did
not
like
their
quarters
,
and
decamped
without
beat
of
drum
.
<EOS>
In
the
summer
,
about
eight
or
nine
at
night
,
part
of
the
noblesse
may
be
seen
assembled
in
a
place
called
the
Pare
;
which
is
,
indeed
,
a
sort
of
a
street
formed
by
a
row
of
very
paltry
houses
on
one
side
,
and
on
the
other
,
by
part
of
the
town
-
wall
,
which
screens
it
from
a
prospect
of
the
sea
,
the
only
object
that
could
render
it
agreeable
.
<EOS>
Here
you
may
perceive
the
noblesse
stretched
in
pairs
upon
logs
of
wood
,
like
so
many
seals
upon
the
rocks
by
moon
-
light
,
each
dame
with
her
cicisbeo
:
for
,
you
must
understand
,
this
Italian
fashion
prevails
at
Nice
among
all
ranks
of
people
;
and
there
is
not
such
a
passion
as
jealousy
known
.
<EOS>
The
husband
and
the
cicisbeo
live
together
as
sworn
brothers
;
and
the
wife
and
the
mistress
embrace
each
other
with
marks
of
the
warmest
affection
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
choose
to
enter
into
particulars
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
open
the
scandalous
chronicle
of
Nice
,
without
hazard
of
contamination
.
<EOS>
With
respect
to
delicacy
and
decorum
,
you
may
peruse
dean
Swift
's
description
of
the
Yahoos
,
and
then
you
will
have
some
idea
of
the
porcheria
,
that
distinguishes
the
gallantry
of
Nice
.
<EOS>
But
the
Pare
is
not
the
only
place
of
public
resort
for
our
noblesse
in
a
summer
's
evening
.
<EOS>
Just
without
one
of
our
gates
,
you
will
find
them
seated
in
ditches
on
the
highway
side
,
serenaded
with
the
croaking
of
frogs
,
and
the
bells
and
braying
of
mules
and
asses
continually
passing
in
a
perpetual
cloud
of
dust
.
<EOS>
Besides
these
amusements
,
there
is
a
public
conversazione
every
evening
at
the
commandant
's
house
called
the
Government
,
where
those
noble
personages
play
at
cards
for
farthings
.
<EOS>
In
carnival
time
,
there
is
also
,
at
this
same
government
,
a
ball
twice
or
thrice
a
week
,
carried
on
by
subscription
.
<EOS>
At
this
assembly
every
person
,
without
distinction
,
is
permitted
to
dance
in
masquerade
:
but
,
after
dancing
,
they
are
obliged
to
unmask
,
and
if
Bourgeois
,
to
retire
.
<EOS>
No
individual
can
give
a
ball
,
without
obtaining
a
permission
and
guard
of
the
commandant
;
and
then
his
house
is
open
to
all
masques
,
without
distinction
,
who
are
provided
with
tickets
,
which
tickets
are
sold
by
the
commandant
's
secretary
,
at
five
sols
a
-
piece
,
and
delivered
to
the
guard
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
If
I
have
a
mind
to
entertain
my
particular
friends
,
I
can
not
have
more
than
a
couple
of
violins
;
and
,
in
that
case
,
it
is
called
a
conversazione
.
  
<EOS>
Though
the
king
of
Sardinia
takes
all
opportunities
to
distinguish
the
subjects
of
Great
-
Britain
with
particular
marks
of
respect
,
I
have
seen
enough
to
be
convinced
,
that
our
nation
is
looked
upon
with
an
evil
eye
by
the
people
of
Nice
;
and
this
arises
partly
from
religious
prejudices
,
and
partly
from
envy
,
occasioned
by
a
ridiculous
notion
of
our
superior
wealth
.
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
owe
them
nothing
on
the
score
of
civilities
;
and
therefore
,
I
shall
say
nothing
more
on
the
subject
,
lest
I
should
be
tempted
to
deviate
from
that
temperance
and
impartiality
which
I
would
fain
hope
<EOS>
have
hitherto
characterised
the
remarks
of
,
  
<EOS>
Dear
Sir
,
your
faithful

humble
servant

<EOS>
NICE
,
September
2
,
1764
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
DOCTOR
,
 
I
wrote
in
May
to
Mr
B
  
at
Geneva
,
and
gave
him
what
information
he
desired
to
have
,
touching
the
conveniences
of
Nice
.
<EOS>
I
shall
now
enter
into
the
same
detail
,
for
the
benefit
of
such
of
your
friends
or
patients
,
as
may
have
occasion
to
try
this
climate
.
  
<EOS>
The
journey
from
Calais
to
Nice
,
of
four
persons
in
a
coach
,
or
two
post
-
chaises
,
with
a
servant
on
horseback
,
travelling
post
,
may
be
performed
with
ease
,
for
about
one
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
,
including
every
expence
.
<EOS>
Either
at
Calais
or
at
Paris
,
you
will
always
find
a
travelling
coach
or
berline
,
which
you
may
buy
for
thirty
or
forty
guineas
,
and
this
will
serve
very
well
to
reconvey
you
to
your
own
country
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
town
of
Nice
,
you
will
find
no
ready
-
furnished
lodgings
for
a
whole
family
.
<EOS>
Just
without
one
of
the
gates
,
there
are
two
houses
to
be
let
,
ready
-
furnished
,
for
about
five
loui'dores
per
month
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
country
houses
in
this
neighbourhood
,
they
are
damp
in
winter
,
and
generally
without
chimnies
;
and
in
summer
they
are
rendered
uninhabitable
by
the
heat
and
the
vermin
.
<EOS>
If
you
hire
a
tenement
in
Nice
,
you
must
take
it
for
a
year
certain
;
and
this
will
cost
you
about
twenty
pounds
sterling
.
<EOS>
For
this
price
,
I
have
a
ground
floor
paved
with
brick
,
consisting
of
a
kitchen
,
two
large
halls
,
a
couple
of
good
rooms
with
chimnies
,
three
large
closets
that
serve
for
bed
-
chambers
,
and
dressing
-
rooms
,
a
butler
's
room
,
and
three
apartments
for
servants
,
lumber
or
stores
,
to
which
we
ascend
by
narrow
wooden
stairs
.
<EOS>
I
have
likewise
two
small
gardens
,
well
stocked
with
oranges
,
lemons
,
peaches
,
figs
,
grapes
,
corinths
,
sallad
,
and
pot
-
herbs
.
<EOS>
It
is
supplied
with
a
draw
-
well
of
good
water
,
and
there
is
another
in
the
vestibule
of
the
house
,
which
is
cool
,
large
,
and
magnificent
.
<EOS>
You
may
hire
furniture
for
such
a
tenement
for
about
two
guineas
a
month
:
but
I
chose
rather
to
buy
what
was
necessary
;
and
this
cost
me
about
sixty
pounds
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
will
fetch
me
about
half
the
money
when
I
leave
the
place
.
<EOS>
It
is
very
difficult
to
find
a
tolerable
cook
at
Nice
.
<EOS>
A
common
maid
,
who
serves
the
people
of
the
country
,
for
three
or
four
livres
a
month
,
will
not
live
with
an
English
family
under
eight
or
ten
.
<EOS>
They
are
all
slovenly
,
slothful
,
and
unconscionable
cheats
.
<EOS>
The
markets
at
Nice
are
tolerably
well
supplied
.
<EOS>
Their
beef
,
which
comes
from
Piedmont
,
is
pretty
good
,
and
we
have
it
all
the
year
.
<EOS>
In
the
winter
we
have
likewise
excellent
pork
,
and
delicate
lamb
;
but
the
mutton
is
indifferent
.
<EOS>
Piedmont
,
also
,
affords
us
delicious
capons
,
fed
with
maize
;
and
this
country
produces
excellent
turkeys
,
but
very
few
geese
.
<EOS>
Chickens
and
pullets
are
extremely
meagre
.
<EOS>
I
have
tried
to
fatten
them
,
without
success
.
<EOS>
In
summer
they
are
subject
to
the
pip
,
and
die
in
great
numbers
.
<EOS>
Autumn
and
winter
are
the
seasons
for
game
;
hares
,
partridges
,
quails
,
wild
-
pigeons
,
woodcocks
,
snipes
,
thrushes
,
beccaficas
,
and
ortolans
.
<EOS>
Wild
-
boar
is
sometimes
found
in
the
mountains
:
it
has
a
delicious
taste
,
not
unlike
that
of
the
wild
hog
in
Jamaica
;
and
would
make
an
excellent
barbecue
,
about
the
beginning
of
winter
,
when
it
is
in
good
case
:
<EOS>
but
,
when
meagre
,
the
head
only
is
presented
at
tables
.
<EOS>
Pheasants
are
very
scarce
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
heath
-
game
,
I
never
saw
but
one
cock
,
which
my
servant
bought
in
the
market
,
and
brought
home
;
but
the
commandant
's
cook
came
into
my
kitchen
,
and
carried
it
of
,
after
it
was
half
plucked
,
saying
,
his
master
had
company
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
The
hares
are
large
,
plump
,
and
juicy
.
<EOS>
The
partridges
are
generally
of
the
red
sort
;
large
as
pullets
,
and
of
a
good
flavour
:
there
are
also
some
grey
partridges
in
the
mountains
;
and
another
sort
of
a
white
colour
,
that
weigh
four
or
five
pounds
each
.
<EOS>
Beccaficas
are
smaller
than
sparrows
,
but
very
fat
,
and
they
are
generally
eaten
half
raw
.
<EOS>
The
best
way
of
dressing
them
is
to
stuff
them
into
a
roll
,
scooped
of
<EOS>
it
's
crum
;
to
baste
them
well
with
butter
,
and
roast
them
,
until
they
are
brown
and
crisp
.
<EOS>
The
ortolans
are
kept
in
cages
,
and
crammed
,
until
they
die
of
fat
,
then
eaten
as
dainties
.
<EOS>
The
thrush
is
presented
with
the
trail
,
because
the
bird
feeds
on
olives
.
<EOS>
They
may
as
well
eat
the
trail
of
a
sheep
,
because
it
feeds
on
the
aromatic
herbs
of
the

In
the
summer
,
we
have
beef
,
veal
,
and
mutton
,
chicken
,
and
ducks
;
which
last
are
very
fat
,
and
very
flabby
.
<EOS>
All
the
meat
is
tough
in
this
season
,
because
the
excessive
heat
,
and
great
number
of
flies
,
will
not
admit
of
its
being
kept
any
time
after
it
is
killed
.
<EOS>
Butter
and
milk
,
though
not
very
delicate
,
we
have
all
the
year
.
<EOS>
Our
tea
and
fine
sugar
come
from
Marseilles
,
at
a
very
reasonable
price
.
  
<EOS>
Nice
is
not
without
variety
of
fish
;
though
they
are
not
counted
so
good
in
their
kinds
as
those
of
the
ocean
.
<EOS>
Soals
,
and
flat
-
fish
in
general
,
are
scarce
.
<EOS>
Here
are
some
mullets
,
both
grey
and
red
.
<EOS>
We
sometimes
see
the
dory
,
which
is
called
St
Pierre
;
with
rock
-
fish
,
bonita
,
and
mackarel
.
<EOS>
The
gurnard
appears
pretty
often
;
and
there
is
plenty
of
a
kind
of
large
whiting
,
which
eats
pretty
well
;
but
has
not
the
delicacy
of
that
which
is
caught
on
our
coast
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
best
fish
of
this
country
,
is
called
Le
Loup
,
about
two
or
three
pounds
in
weight
;
white
,
firm
,
and
well
-
flavoured
.
<EOS>
Another
,
no
-
way
inferior
to
it
,
is
the
Moustel
,
about
the
same
size
;
of
a
dark
-
grey
colour
,
and
short
,
blunt
snout
;
growing
thinner
and
flatter
from
the
shoulders
downwards
,
so
as
to
resemble
a
soal
at
the
tail
.
<EOS>
This
can
not
be
the
mustela
of
the
antients
,
which
is
supposed
to
be
the
sea
lamprey
.
<EOS>
Here
too
are
found
the
vyvre
,
or
,
as
we
call
it
,
weaver
;
remarkable
for
its
long
,
sharp
spines
,
so
dangerous
to
the
fingers
of
the
fishermen
.
<EOS>
We
have
abundance
of
the
saepia
,
or
cuttle
-
fish
,
of
which
the
people
in
this
country
make
a
delicate
ragout
;
as
also
of
the
polype
de
mer
,
which
is
an
ugly
animal
,
with
long
feelers
,
like
tails
,
which
they
often
wind
about
the
legs
of
the
fishermen
.
<EOS>
They
are
stewed
with
onions
,
and
eat
something
like
cow
-
heel
.
<EOS>
The
market
sometimes
affords
the
ecrivisse
de
mer
,
which
is
a
lobster
without
claws
,
of
a
sweetish
taste
;
and
there
are
a
few
rock
oysters
,
very
small
and
very
rank
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
the
fishermen
find
under
water
,
pieces
of
a
very
hard
cement
,
like
plaister
of
Paris
,
which
contain
a
kind
of
muscle
,
called
la
datte
,
from
its
resemblance
to
a
date
.
<EOS>
These
petrifactions
are
commonly
of
a
triangular
form
and
may
weigh
about
twelve
or
fifteen
pounds
each
and
one
of
them
may
contain
a
dozen
of
these
muscles
which
have
nothing
extraordinary
in
the
taste
or
flavour
,
though
extremely
curious
,
as
found
alive
and
juicy
,
in
the
heart
of
a
rock
,
almost
as
hard
as
marble
,
without
any
visible
communication
with
the
air
or
water
.
<EOS>
I
take
it
for
granted
,
however
,
that
the
inclosing
cement
is
porous
,
and
admits
the
finer
parts
of
the
surrounding
fluid
.
<EOS>
In
order
to
reach
the
muscles
,
this
cement
must
be
broke
with
large
hammers
;
and
it
may
be
truly
said
,
the
kernal
is
not
worth
the
trouble
of
cracking
the
shell
.
<EOS>
[
These
are
found
in
great
plenty
at
Ancona
and
other
parts
of
the
Adriatic
,
where
they
go
by
the
name
of
Bollani
,
as
we
are
informed
by
Keysler
.
]
<EOS>
Among
the
fish
of
this
country
,
there
is
a
very
ugly
animal
of
the
eel
species
,
which
might
pass
for
a
serpent
:
it
is
of
a
dusky
,
black
colour
,
marked
with
spots
of
yellow
,
about
eighteen
inches
,
or
two
feet
long
.
<EOS>
The
Italians
call
it
murena
;
but
whether
it
is
the
fish
which
had
the
same
name
among
the
antient
Romans
,
I
can
not
pretend
to
determine
.
<EOS>
The
antient
murena
was
counted
a
great
delicacy
,
and
was
kept
in
ponds
for
extraordinary
occasions
.
<EOS>
Julius
Caesar
borrowed
six
thousand
for
one
entertainment
:
but
I
imagined
this
was
the
river
lamprey
.
<EOS>
The
murena
of
this
country
is
in
no
esteem
,
and
only
eaten
by
the
poor
people
.
  
<EOS>
Craw
-
fish
and
trout
are
rarely
found
in
the
rivers
among
the
mountains
.
<EOS>
The
sword
-
fish
is
much
esteemed
in
Nice
,
and
called
l'empereur
,
about
six
or
seven
feet
long
:
but
I
have
never
seen
it
.
<EOS>
[
Since
I
wrote
the
above
letter
,
I
have
eaten
several
times
of
this
fish
,
which
is
as
white
as
the
finest
veal
,
and
extremely
delicate
.
<EOS>
The
emperor
associates
with
the
tunny
fish
,
and
is
always
taken
in
their
company
.
]
<EOS>
They
are
very
scarce
;
and
when
taken
,
are
generally
concealed
,
because
the
head
belongs
to
the
commandant
,
who
has
likewise
the
privilege
of
buying
the
best
fish
at
a
very
low
price
.
<EOS>
For
which
reason
,
the
choice
pieces
are
concealed
by
the
fishermen
,
and
sent
privately
to
Piedmont
or
Genoa
.
<EOS>
But
,
the
chief
fisheries
on
this
coast
are
of
the
sardines
,
anchovies
,
and
tunny
.
<EOS>
These
are
taken
in
small
quantities
all
the
year
;
but
spring
and
summer
is
the
season
when
they
mostly
abound
.
<EOS>
In
June
and
July
,
a
fleet
of
about
fifty
fishing
-
boats
puts
to
sea
every
evening
about
eight
o'clock
,
and
catches
anchovies
in
immense
quantities
.
<EOS>
One
small
boat
sometimes
takes
in
one
night
twenty
-
five
rup
,
amounting
to
six
hundred
weight
;
but
it
must
be
observed
,
that
the
pound
here
,
as
well
as
in
other
parts
of
Italy
,
consists
but
of
twelve
ounces
.
<EOS>
Anchovies
,
besides
their
making
a
considerable
article
in
the
commerce
of
Nice
,
are
a
great
resource
in
all
families
.
<EOS>
The
noblesse
and
burgeois
sup
on
sallad
and
anchovies
,
which
are
eaten
on
all
their
meagre
days
.
<EOS>
The
fishermen
and
mariners
all
along
this
coast
have
scarce
any
other
food
but
dry
bread
,
with
a
few
pickled
anchovies
;
and
when
the
fish
is
eaten
,
they
rub
their
crusts
with
the
brine
.
<EOS>
Nothing
can
be
more
delicious
than
fresh
anchovies
fried
in
oil
:
I
prefer
them
to
the
smelts
of
the
Thames
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
mention
,
that
the
sardines
and
anchovies
are
caught
in
nets
;
salted
,
barrelled
,
and
exported
into
all
the
different
kingdoms
and
states
of
Europe
.
<EOS>
The
sardines
,
however
,
are
largest
and
fattest
in
the
month
of
September
.
<EOS>
A
company
of
adventurers
have
farmed
the
tunny
-
fishery
of
the
king
,
for
six
years
;
a
monopoly
,
for
which
they
pay
about
three
thousand
pounds
sterling
.
<EOS>
They
are
at
a
very
considerable
expence
for
nets
,
boats
,
and
attendance
.
<EOS>
Their
nets
are
disposed
in
a
very
curious
manner
across
the
small
bay
of
St
Hospice
,
in
this
neighbourhood
,
where
the
fish
chiefly
resort
.
<EOS>
They
are
never
removed
,
except
in
the
winter
,
and
when
they
want
repair
:
but
there
are
avenues
for
the
fish
to
enter
,
and
pass
,
from
one
inclosure
to
another
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
man
in
a
boat
,
who
constantly
keeps
watch
.
<EOS>
When
he
perceives
they
are
fairly
entered
,
he
has
a
method
for
shutting
all
the
passes
,
and
confining
the
fish
to
one
apartment
of
the
net
,
which
is
lifted
up
into
the
boat
,
until
the
prisoners
are
taken
and
secured
.
<EOS>
The
tunny
-
fish
generally
runs
from
fifty
to
one
hundred
weight
;
but
some
of
them
are
much
larger
.
<EOS>
They
are
immediately
gutted
,
boiled
,
and
cut
in
slices
.
<EOS>
The
guts
and
head
afford
oil
:
the
slices
are
partly
dried
,
to
be
eaten
occasionally
with
oil
and
vinegar
,
or
barrelled
up
in
oil
,
to
be
exported
.
<EOS>
It
is
counted
a
delicacy
in
Italy
and
Piedmont
,
and
tastes
not
unlike
sturgeon
.
<EOS>
The
famous
pickle
of
the
ancients
,
called
garum
,
was
made
of
the
gills
and
blood
of
the
tunny
,
or
thynnus
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
much
more
considerable
fishery
of
it
in
Sardinia
,
where
it
is
said
to
employ
four
hundred
persons
;
but
this
belongs
to
the
duc
de
St
Pierre
.
<EOS>
In
the
neighbourhood
of
Villa
Franca
,
there
are
people
always
employed
in
fishing
for
coral
and
sponge
,
which
grow
adhering
to
the
rocks
under
water
.
<EOS>
Their
methods
do
not
favour
much
of
ingenuity
.
<EOS>
For
the
coral
,
they
lower
down
a
swab
,
composed
of
what
is
called
spunyarn
on
board
our
ships
of
war
,
hanging
in
distinct
threads
,
and
sunk
by
means
of
a
great
weight
,
which
,
striking
against
the
coral
in
its
descent
,
disengages
it
from
the
rocks
;
and
some
of
the
pieces
being
intangled
among
the
threads
of
the
swab
,
are
brought
up
with
it
above
water
.
<EOS>
The
sponge
is
got
by
means
of
a
cross
-
stick
,
fitted
with
hooks
,
which
being
lowered
down
,
fastens
upon
it
,
and
tears
it
from
the
rocks
.
<EOS>
In
some
parts
of
the
Adriatic
and
Archipelago
,
these
substances
are
gathered
by
divers
,
who
can
remain
five
minutes
below
water
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
not
detain
you
one
minute
longer
;
though
I
must
observe
,
that
there
is
plenty
of
fine
samphire
growing
along
all
these
rocks
,
neglected
and
unknown
.

<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
<EOS>
Before
I
tell
you
the
price
of
provisions
at
Nice
,
it
will
be
necessary
to
say
something
of
the
money
.
<EOS>
The
gold
coin
of
Sardinia
consists
of
the
doppia
di
savoia
,
value
twenty
-
four
livres
Piedmontese
,
about
the
size
of
a
loui'dore
;
and
the
mezzo
doppia
,
or
piece
of
twelve
livres
.
<EOS>
In
silver
,
there
is
the
scudo
of
six
livres
,
the
mezzo
scudo
of
three
;
and
the
quarto
,
or
pezza
di
trenta
soldi
:
but
all
these
are
very
scarce
.
<EOS>
We
seldom
see
any
gold
and
silver
coin
,
but
the
loui'dore
,
and
the
six
,
and
three
-
livre
Pieces
of
France
;
a
sure
sign
that
the
French
suffer
by
their
contraband
commerce
with
the
Nissards
.
<EOS>
The
coin
chiefly
used
at
market
is
a
piece
of
copper
silvered
,
that
passes
for
seven
sols
and
a
half
;
another
of
the
same
sort
,
valued
two
sols
and
a
half
.
<EOS>
They
have
on
one
side
the
impression
of
the
king
's
head
;
and
on
the
other
,
the
arms
of
Savoy
,
with
a
ducal
crown
,
inscribed
with
his
name
and
titles
.
<EOS>
There
are
of
genuine
copper
,
pieces
of
one
sol
,
stamped
on
one
side
with
a
cross
fleuree
;
and
on
the
reverse
,
with
the
king
's
cypher
and
crown
,
inscribed
as
the
others
:
finally
,
there
is
another
small
copper
piece
,
called
piccalon
,
the
sixth
part
of
a
sol
,
with
a
plain
cross
,
and
on
the
reverse
,
a
slip
-
knot
surmounted
with
a
crown
;
the
legend
as
above
.
<EOS>
The
impression
and
legend
on
the
gold
and
silver
coins
,
are
the
same
as
those
on
the
pieces
of
seven
sols
and
a
half
.
<EOS>
The
livre
of
Piedmont
consists
of
twenty
sols
,
and
is
very
near
of
the
same
value
as
an
English
shilling
:
<EOS>
ten
sols
,
therefore
,
are
equal
to
six
-
pence
sterling
.
<EOS>
Butcher
's
meat
in
general
sells
at
Nice
for
three
sols
a
pound
;
and
veal
is
something
dearer
:
<EOS>
but
then
there
are
but
twelve
ounces
in
the
pound
,
which
being
allowed
for
,
sixteen
ounces
<EOS>
,
come
for
something
less
than
twopence
halfpenny
English
.
<EOS>
Fish
commonly
sells
for
four
sols
the
twelve
ounces
,
or
five
for
the
English
pound
;
and
these
five
are
equivalent
to
three
-
pence
of
our
money
:
but
sometimes
we
are
obliged
to
pay
five
,
and
even
six
sols
for
the
Piedmontese
pound
of
fish
.
<EOS>
A
turkey
that
would
sell
for
five
or
six
shillings
at
the
London
market
,
costs
me
but
three
at
Nice
.
<EOS>
I
can
buy
a
good
capon
for
thirty
sols
,
or
eighteen
-
pence
;
and
the
same
price
I
pay
for
a
brace
of
partridges
,
or
a
good
hare
.
<EOS>
I
can
have
a
woodcock
for
twenty
-
four
sols
;
but
the
pigeons
are
dearer
than
in
London
.
<EOS>
Rabbits
are
very
rare
;
and
there
is
scarce
a
goose
to
be
seen
in
the
whole
county
of
Nice
.
<EOS>
Wild
-
ducks
and
teal
are
sometimes
to
be
had
in
the
winter
;
and
now
I
am
speaking
of
sea
-
fowl
,
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
tell
you
what
I
know
of
the
halcyon
,
or
king's
-
fisher
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
bird
,
though
very
rare
in
this
country
about
the
size
of
a
pigeon
;
the
body
brown
,
and
the
belly
white
:
<EOS>
by
a
wonderful
instinct
it
makes
its
nest
upon
the
surface
of
the
sea
,
and
lays
its
eggs
in
the
month
of
November
,
when
the
Mediterranean
is
always
calm
and
smooth
as
a
mill
-
pond
.
<EOS>
The
people
about
here
call
them
martinets
,
because
they
begin
to
hatch
about
Martinmass
.
<EOS>
Their
nests
are
sometimes
seen
floating
near
the
shore
,
and
generally
become
the
prize
of
the
boys
,
who
are
very
alert
in
catching
them
.
  
<EOS>
You
know
all
sea
-
birds
are
allowed
by
the
church
of
Rome
to
be
eaten
on
meagre
days
,
as
a
kind
of
fish
;
and
the
monks
especially
do
not
fail
to
make
use
of
this
permission
.
<EOS>
Sea
turtle
,
or
tortoises
,
are
often
found
at
sea
by
the
mariners
,
in
these
latitudes
:
but
they
are
not
the
green
sort
,
so
much
in
request
among
the
aldermen
of
London
.
<EOS>
All
the
Mediterranean
turtle
are
of
the
kind
called
loggerhead
,
which
in
the
West
-
Indies
are
eaten
by
none
but
hungry
seamen
,
negroes
,
and
the
lowest
class
of
people
.
<EOS>
One
of
these
,
weighing
about
two
hundred
pounds
,
was
lately
brought
on
shore
by
the
fishermen
of
Nice
,
who
found
it
floating
asleep
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
.
<EOS>
The
whole
town
was
alarmed
at
sight
of
such
a
monster
,
the
nature
of
which
they
could
not
comprehend
.
<EOS>
However
,
the
monks
,
called
minims
,
of
St
Francesco
di
Paolo
,
guided
by
a
sure
instinct
,
marked
it
as
their
prey
,
and
surrounded
it
accordingly
.
<EOS>
The
friars
of
other
convents
,
not
quite
so
hungry
,
crowding
down
to
the
beach
,
declared
it
should
not
be
eaten
;
dropped
some
hints
about
the
possibility
of
its
being
something
praeternatural
and
diabolical
,
and
even
proposed
exorcisms
and
aspersions
with
holy
water
.
<EOS>
The
populace
were
divided
according
to
their
attachment
to
this
,
or
that
convent
:
a
mighty
clamour
arose
;
and
the
police
,
in
order
to
remove
the
cause
of
their
contention
,
ordered
the
tortoise
to
be
recommitted
to
the
waves
;
a
sentence
which
the
Franciscans
saw
executed
,
not
without
sighs
and
lamentation
.
<EOS>
The
land
-
turtle
,
or
terrapin
,
is
much
better
known
at
Nice
,
as
being
a
native
of
this
country
;
yet
the
best
are
brought
from
the
island
of
Sardinia
.
<EOS>
The
soup
or
bouillon
of
this
animal
is
always
prescribed
here
as
a
great
restorative
to
consumptive
patients
.
<EOS>
The
bread
of
Nice
is
very
indifferent
,
and
I
am
persuaded
very
unwholesome
.
<EOS>
The
flour
is
generally
musty
,
and
not
quite
free
of
sand
.
<EOS>
This
is
either
owing
to
the
particles
of
the
mill
-
stone
rubbed
off
in
grinding
,
or
to
what
adheres
to
the
corn
itself
,
in
being
threshed
upon
the
common
ground
;
for
there
are
no
threshing
-
floors
in
this
country
.
<EOS>
I
shall
now
take
notice
of
the
vegetables
of
Nice
.
<EOS>
In
the
winter
,
we
have
green
pease
,
asparagus
,
artichoaks
,
cauliflower
,
beans
,
French
beans
,
celery
,
and
endive
;
cabbage
,
coleworts
,
radishes
,
turnips
,
carrots
,
betteraves
,
sorrel
lettuce
,
onions
,
garlic
,
and
chalot
.
<EOS>
We
have
potatoes
from
the
mountains
,
mushrooms
,
champignons
,
and
truffles
.
<EOS>
Piedmont
affords
white
truffles
,
counted
the
most
delicious
in
the
world
:
they
sell
for
about
three
livres
the
pound
.
<EOS>
The
fruits
of
this
season
are
pickled
olives
,
oranges
,
lemons
,
citrons
,
citronelles
,
dried
figs
,
grapes
,
apples
,
pears
,
almonds
,
chestnuts
,
walnuts
,
filberts
,
medlars
,
pomegranates
,
and
a
fruit
called
azerolles
,
[
The
Italians
call
them
Lazerruoli
.
]
<EOS>
about
the
size
of
a
nutmeg
,
of
an
oblong
shape
,
red
colour
,
and
agreeable
acid
taste
.
<EOS>
I
might
likewise
add
the
cherry
of
the
Laurus
cerasus
,
which
is
sold
in
the
market
;
very
beautiful
to
the
eye
,
but
insipid
to
the
palate
.
<EOS>
In
summer
we
have
all
those
vegetables
in
perfection
.
<EOS>
There
is
also
a
kind
of
small
courge
,
or
gourd
,
of
which
the
people
of
the
country
make
a
very
savoury
ragout
,
with
the
help
of
eggs
,
cheese
,
and
fresh
anchovies
.
<EOS>
Another
is
made
of
the
badenjean
,
which
the
Spaniards
call
berengena
:
[
This
fruit
is
called
Melanzana
in
Italy
and
is
much
esteemed
by
the
Jews
in
Leghorn
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
Melanzana
is
a
corruption
of
Malamsana
.
]
<EOS>
it
is
much
eaten
in
Spain
and
the
Levant
,
as
well
as
by
the
Moors
in
Barbary
.
<EOS>
It
is
about
the
size
and
shape
of
a
hen
's
egg
,
inclosed
in
a
cup
like
an
acorn
;
when
ripe
,
of
a
faint
purple
colour
.
<EOS>
It
grows
on
a
stalk
about
a
foot
high
,
with
long
spines
or
prickles
.
<EOS>
The
people
here
have
different
ways
of
slicing
and
dressing
it
,
by
broiling
,
boiling
,
and
stewing
,
with
other
ingredients
:
but
it
is
at
best
an
insipid
dish
.
<EOS>
There
are
some
caperbushes
in
this
neighbourhood
,
which
grow
wild
in
holes
of
garden
walls
,
and
require
no
sort
of
cultivation
:
in
one
or
two
gardens
,
there
are
palm
-
trees
;
but
the
dates
never
ripen
.
<EOS>
In
my
register
of
the
weather
,
I
have
marked
the
seasons
of
the
principal
fruits
in
this
country
.
<EOS>
In
May
we
have
strawberries
,
which
continue
in
season
two
or
three
months
.
<EOS>
These
are
of
the
wood
kind
;
very
grateful
,
and
of
a
good
flavour
;
but
the
scarlets
and
hautboys
are
not
known
at
Nice
.
<EOS>
In
the
beginning
of
June
,
and
even
sooner
,
the
cherries
begin
to
be
ripe
.
<EOS>
They
are
a
kind
of
bleeding
hearts
;
large
,
fleshy
,
and
high
flavoured
,
though
rather
too
luscious
.
<EOS>
I
have
likewise
seen
a
few
of
those
we
call
Kentish
cherries
which
are
much
more
cool
,
acid
,
and
agreeable
,
especially
in
this
hot
climate
.
<EOS>
The
cherries
are
succeeded
by
the
apricots
and
peaches
,
which
are
all
standards
,
and
of
consequence
better
flavoured
than
what
we
call
wall
-
fruit
.
<EOS>
The
trees
,
as
well
as
almonds
,
grow
and
bear
without
care
and
cultivation
,
and
may
be
seen
in
the
open
fields
about
Nice
,
but
without
proper
culture
,
the
fruit
degenerates
.
<EOS>
The
best
peaches
I
have
seen
at
Nice
are
the
amberges
,
of
a
yellow
hue
,
and
oblong
shape
,
about
the
size
of
a
small
lemon
.
<EOS>
Their
consistence
is
much
more
solid
than
that
of
our
English
peaches
,
and
their
taste
more
delicious
.
<EOS>
Several
trees
of
this
kind
I
have
in
my
own
garden
.
<EOS>
Here
is
likewise
plenty
of
other
sorts
;
but
no
nectarines
.
<EOS>
We
have
little
choice
of
plumbs
.
<EOS>
Neither
do
I
admire
the
pears
or
apples
of
this
country
:
but
the
most
agreeable
apples
I
ever
tasted
,
come
from
Final
,
and
are
called
pomi
carli
.
<EOS>
The
greatest
fault
I
find
with
most
fruits
in
this
climate
,
is
,
that
they
are
too
sweet
and
luscious
,
and
want
that
agreeable
acid
which
is
so
cooling
and
so
grateful
in
a
hot
country
.
<EOS>
This
,
too
,
is
the
case
with
our
grapes
,
of
which
there
is
great
plenty
and
variety
,
plump
and
juicy
,
and
large
as
plumbs
.
<EOS>
Nature
,
however
,
has
not
neglected
to
provide
other
agreeable
vegetable
juices
to
cool
the
human
body
.
<EOS>
During
the
whole
summer
,
we
have
plenty
of
musk
melons
.
<EOS>
I
can
buy
one
as
large
as
my
head
for
the
value
of
an
English
penny
:
but
one
of
the
best
and
largest
,
weighing
ten
or
twelve
pounds
,
I
can
have
for
twelve
sols
,
or
about
eight
-
pence
sterling
.
<EOS>
From
Antibes
and
Sardinia
,
we
have
another
fruit
called
a
watermelon
,
which
is
well
known
in
Jamaica
,
and
some
of
our
other
colonies
.
<EOS>
Those
from
Antibes
are
about
the
size
of
an
ordinary
bomb
-
shell
:
but
the
Sardinian
and
Jamaica
watermelons
are
four
times
as
large
.
<EOS>
The
skin
is
green
,
smooth
,
and
thin
.
<EOS>
The
inside
is
a
purple
pulp
,
studded
with
broad
,
flat
,
black
seeds
,
and
impregnated
with
a
juice
the
most
cool
,
delicate
,
and
refreshing
,
that
can
well
be
conceived
.
<EOS>
One
would
imagine
the
pulp
itself
dissolved
in
the
stomach
;
for
you
may
eat
of
it
until
you
are
filled
up
to
the
tongue
,
without
feeling
the
least
inconvenience
.
<EOS>
It
is
so
friendly
to
the
constitution
,
that
in
ardent
inflammatory
fevers
,
it
is
drank
as
the
best
emulsion
.
<EOS>
At
Genoa
,
Florence
,
and
Rome
,
it
is
sold
in
the
streets
,
ready
cut
in
slices
;
and
the
porters
,
sweating
under
their
burthens
,
buy
,
and
eat
them
as
they
pass
.
<EOS>
A
porter
of
London
quenches
his
thirst
with
a
draught
of
strong
beer
:
a
porter
of
Rome
,
or
Naples
,
refreshes
himself
with
a
slice
of
water
-
melon
,
or
a
glass
of
iced
-
water
.
<EOS>
The
one
costs
three
half
-
pence
;
the
last
,
half
a
farthing
 
which
of
them
is
most
effectual
?
<EOS>
I
am
sure
the
men
are
equally
pleased
.
<EOS>
It
is
commonly
remarked
,
that
beer
strengthens
as
well
as
refreshes
.
<EOS>
But
the
porters
of
Constantinople
,
who
never
drink
any
thing
stronger
than
water
,
and
eat
very
little
animal
food
,
will
lift
and
carry
heavier
burthens
than
any
other
porters
in
the
known
world
.
<EOS>
If
we
may
believe
the
most
respectable
travellers
,
a
Turk
will
carry
a
load
of
seven
hundred
weight
,
which
is
more
(
I
believe
)
than
any
English
porter
ever
attempted
to
carry
any
length
of
way
.
  
<EOS>
Among
the
refreshments
of
these
warm
countries
,
I
ought
not
to
forget
mentioning
the
sorbettes
,
which
are
sold
in
coffee
-
houses
,
and
places
of
public
resort
.
<EOS>
They
are
iced
froth
,
made
with
juice
of
oranges
,
apricots
,
or
peaches
;
very
agreeable
to
the
palate
,
and
so
extremely
cold
,
that
I
was
afraid
to
swallow
them
in
this
hot
country
,
until
I
found
from
information
and
experience
,
that
they
may
be
taken
in
moderation
,
without
any
bad
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
Another
considerable
article
in
house
-
keeping
is
wine
,
which
we
have
here
good
and
reasonable
.
<EOS>
The
wine
of
Tavelle
in
Languedoc
is
very
near
as
good
as
Burgundy
,
and
may
be
had
at
Nice
,
at
the
rate
of
six
-
pence
a
bottle
.
<EOS>
The
sweet
wine
of
St
Laurent
,
counted
equal
to
that
of
Frontignan
,
costs
about
eight
or
nine
-
pence
a
quart
:
pretty
good
Malaga
may
be
had
for
half
the
money
.
<EOS>
Those
who
make
their
own
wine
choose
the
grapes
from
different
vineyards
,
and
have
them
picked
,
pressed
,
and
fermented
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
That
which
is
made
by
the
peasants
,
both
red
and
white
,
is
generally
genuine
:
but
the
wine
-
merchants
of
Nice
brew
and
balderdash
,
and
even
mix
it
with
pigeons
dung
and
quick
-
lime
.
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
supposed
,
that
a
stranger
and
sojourner
should
buy
his
own
grapes
,
and
make
his
own
provision
of
wine
:
but
he
may
buy
it
by
recommendation
from
the
peasants
,
for
about
eighteen
or
twenty
livres
<EOS>
the
charge
,
consisting
of
eleven
rup
five
pounds
;
in
other
words
,
of
two
hundred
and
eighty
pounds
of
this
country
,
so
as
to
bring
it
for
something
less
than
three
-
pence
a
quart
.
<EOS>
The
Nice
wine
,
when
mixed
with
water
,
makes
an
agreeable
beverage
.
<EOS>
There
is
an
inferior
sort
for
servants
drank
by
the
common
people
,
which
in
the
cabaret
does
not
cost
above
a
penny
a
bottle
.
<EOS>
The
people
here
are
not
so
nice
as
the
English
,
in
the
management
of
their
wine
.
<EOS>
It
is
kept
in
flacons
,
or
large
flasks
,
without
corks
,
having
a
little
oil
at
top
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
deemed
the
worse
for
having
been
opened
a
day
or
two
before
;
and
they
expose
it
to
the
hot
sun
,
and
all
kinds
of
weather
,
without
hesitation
.
<EOS>
Certain
it
is
,
this
treatment
has
little
or
no
effect
upon
its
taste
,
flavour
,
and
transparency
.
  
<EOS>
The
brandy
of
Nice
is
very
indifferent
:
and
the
liqueurs
are
so
sweetened
with
coarse
sugar
,
that
they
scarce
retain
the
taste
or
flavour
of
any
other
ingredient
.
  
<EOS>
The
last
article
of
domestic
oeconomy
which
I
shall
mention
is
fuel
,
or
wood
for
firing
,
which
I
buy
for
eleven
sols
(
a
little
more
than
six
-
pence
halfpenny
)
<EOS>
a
quintal
,
consisting
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
pound
Nice
weight
.
<EOS>
The
best
,
which
is
of
oak
,
comes
from
Sardinia
.
<EOS>
The
common
sort
is
olive
,
which
being
cut
with
the
sap
in
it
,
ought
to
be
laid
in
during
the
summer
;
otherwise
,
it
will
make
a
very
uncomfortable
fire
.
<EOS>
In
my
kitchen
and
two
chambers
,
I
burned
fifteen
thousand
weight
of
wood
in
four
weeks
,
exclusive
of
charcoal
for
the
kitchen
stoves
,
and
of
pine
-
tops
for
lighting
the
fires
.
<EOS>
These
last
are
as
large
as
pineapples
,
which
they
greatly
resemble
in
shape
,
and
to
which
,
indeed
,
they
give
their
name
;
and
being
full
of
turpentine
,
make
a
wonderful
blaze
.
<EOS>
For
the
same
purpose
,
the
people
of
these
countries
use
the
sarments
,
or
cuttings
of
the
vines
,
which
they
sell
made
up
in
small
fascines
.
<EOS>
This
great
consumption
of
wood
is
owing
to
the
large
fires
used
in
roasting
pieces
of
beef
,
and
joints
,
in
the
English
manner
.
<EOS>
The
roasts
of
this
country
seldom
exceed
two
or
three
pounds
of
meat
;
and
their
other
plats
are
made
over
stove
holes
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
now
high
time
to
conduct
you
from
the
kitchen
,
where
you
have
been
too
long
detained
by
 
Your
humble
servant
.
  
<EOS>
PS
 
<EOS>
I
have
mentioned
the
prices
of
almost
all
the
articles
in
house
-
keeping
,
as
they
are
paid
by
the
English
:
but
exclusive
of
butcher
's
meat
,
I
am
certain
the
natives
do
not
pay
so
much
by
thirty
per
cent
.
<EOS>
Their
imposition
on
us
,
is
not
only
a
proof
of
their
own
villany
and
hatred
,
but
a
scandal
on
their
government
;
which
ought
to
interfere
in
favour
of
the
subjects
of
a
nation
,
to
which
they
are
so
much
bound
in
point
of
policy
,
as
well
as
gratitude
.

SIR
,
 
As
I
have
nothing
else
to
do
,
but
to
satisfy
my
own
curiosity
,
and
that
of
my
friends
,
I
obey
your
injunctions
with
pleasure
;
though
not
without
some
apprehension
that
my
inquiries
will
afford
you
very
little
entertainment
.
<EOS>
The
place
where
I
am
is
of
very
little
importance
or
consequence
as
a
state
or
community
;
neither
is
there
any
thing
curious
or
interesting
in
the
character
or
oeconomy
of
its
inhabitants
.
  
<EOS>
There
are
some
few
merchants
in
Nice
,
said
to
be
in
good
circumstances
.
<EOS>
I
know
one
of
them
,
who
deals
to
a
considerable
extent
,
and
goes
twice
a
year
to
London
to
attend
the
sales
of
the
East
-
India
company
.
<EOS>
He
buys
up
a
very
large
quantity
of
muslins
,
and
other
Indian
goods
,
and
freights
a
ship
in
the
river
to
transport
them
to
Villa
Franca
.
<EOS>
Some
of
these
are
sent
to
Swisserland
;
but
,
I
believe
,
the
greater
part
is
smuggled
into
France
,
by
virtue
of
counterfeit
stamps
,
which
are
here
used
without
any
ceremony
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
chief
commerce
of
this
place
is
a
contraband
traffick
carried
on
to
the
disadvantage
of
France
;
and
I
am
told
,
that
the
farmers
of
the
Levant
company
in
that
kingdom
find
their
account
in
conniving
at
it
.
<EOS>
Certain
it
is
,
a
great
quantity
of
merchandize
is
brought
hither
every
week
by
mules
from
Turin
and
other
parts
in
Piedmont
,
and
afterwards
conveyed
to
the
other
side
of
the
Var
,
either
by
land
or
water
.
<EOS>
The
mules
of
Piedmont
are
exceeding
strong
and
hardy
.
<EOS>
One
of
them
will
carry
a
burthen
of
near
six
hundred
weight
.
<EOS>
They
are
easily
nourished
,
and
require
no
other
respite
from
their
labour
,
but
the
night
's
repose
.
<EOS>
They
are
the
only
carriage
that
can
be
used
in
crossing
the
mountains
,
being
very
sure
-
footed
:
and
it
is
observed
that
in
choosing
their
steps
,
they
always
march
upon
the
brink
of
the
precipice
.
<EOS>
You
must
let
them
take
their
own
way
,
otherwise
you
will
be
in
danger
of
losing
your
life
;
for
they
are
obstinate
,
even
to
desperation
.
<EOS>
It
is
very
dangerous
for
a
person
on
horseback
to
meet
those
animals
:
they
have
such
an
aversion
to
horses
,
that
they
will
attack
them
with
incredible
fury
,
so
as
even
to
tear
them
and
their
riders
in
pieces
;
and
the
best
method
for
avoiding
this
fate
,
is
to
clap
spurs
to
your
beast
,
and
seek
your
safety
in
flight
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
more
than
once
obliged
to
fly
before
them
.
<EOS>
They
always
give
you
warning
,
by
raising
a
hideous
braying
as
soon
as
they
perceive
the
horse
at
a
distance
.
<EOS>
The
mules
of
Provence
are
not
so
mischievous
,
because
they
are
more
used
to
the
sight
and
society
of
horses
:
but
those
of
Piedmont
are
by
far
the
largest
and
the
strongest
I
have
seen
.
  
<EOS>
Some
very
feasible
schemes
for
improving
the
commerce
of
Nice
have
been
presented
to
the
ministry
of
Turin
;
but
hitherto
without
success
.
<EOS>
The
English
import
annually
between
two
and
three
thousand
bales
of
raw
silk
,
the
growth
of
Piedmont
;
and
this
declaration
would
be
held
legal
evidence
.
<EOS>
In
some
parts
of
France
,
the
cure
of
the
parish
,
on
All
Souls
'
day
,
which
is
called
le
jour
des
morts
,
says
a
libera
domine
for
two
sols
,
at
every
grave
in
the
burying
-
ground
,
for
the
release
of
the
soul
whose
body
is
there
interred
.
  
<EOS>
The
artisans
of
Nice
are
very
lazy
,
very
needy
,
very
aukward
,
and
void
of
all
ingenuity
.
<EOS>
The
price
of
their
labour
is
very
near
as
high
as
at
London
or
Paris
.
<EOS>
Rather
than
work
for
moderate
profit
,
arising
from
constant
employment
,
which
would
comfortably
maintain
them
and
their
families
,
they
choose
to
starve
at
home
,
to
lounge
about
the
ramparts
,
bask
themselves
in
the
sun
,
or
play
at
bowls
in
the
streets
from
morning
 
'
till
night
.
  
<EOS>
The
lowest
class
of
people
consists
of
fishermen
,
day
labourers
,
porters
,
and
peasants
:
these
last
are
distributed
chiefly
in
the
small
cassines
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
city
,
and
are
said
to
amount
to
twelve
thousand
.
<EOS>
They
are
employed
in
labouring
the
ground
,
and
have
all
the
outward
signs
of
extreme
misery
.
<EOS>
They
are
all
diminutive
,
meagre
,
withered
,
dirty
,
and
half
naked
;
in
their
complexions
,
not
barely
swarthy
,
but
as
black
as
Moors
;
and
I
believe
many
of
them
are
descendants
of
that
people
.
<EOS>
They
are
very
hard
favoured
;
and
their
women
in
general
have
the
coarsest
features
<EOS>
I
have
ever
seen
:
it
must
be
owned
,
however
,
they
have
the
finest
teeth
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
The
nourishment
of
those
poor
creatures
consists
of
the
refuse
of
the
garden
,
very
coarse
bread
,
a
kind
of
meal
called
polenta
,
made
of
Indian
corn
,
which
is
very
nourishing
and
agreeable
,
and
a
little
oil
;
but
even
in
these
particulars
,
they
seem
to
be
stinted
to
very
scanty
meals
.
<EOS>
I
have
known
a
peasant
feed
his
family
with
the
skins
of
boiled
beans
.
<EOS>
Their
hogs
are
much
better
fed
than
their
children
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
pity
they
have
no
cows
,
which
would
yield
milk
,
butter
,
and
cheese
,
for
the
sustenance
of
their
families
.
<EOS>
With
all
this
wretchedness
,
one
of
these
peasants
will
not
work
in
your
garden
for
less
than
eighteen
sols
,
about
eleven
pence
sterling
,
per
diem
;
and
then
he
does
not
half
the
work
of
an
English
labourer
.
<EOS>
If
there
is
fruit
in
it
,
or
any
thing
he
can
convey
,
he
will
infallibly
steal
it
,
if
you
do
not
keep
a
very
watchful
eye
over
him
.
<EOS>
All
the
common
people
are
thieves
and
beggars
;
and
I
believe
this
is
always
the
case
with
people
who
are
extremely
indigent
and
miserable
.
<EOS>
In
other
respects
,
they
are
seldom
guilty
of
excesses
.
<EOS>
They
are
remarkably
respectful
and
submissive
to
their
superiors
.
<EOS>
The
populace
of
Nice
are
very
quiet
and
orderly
.
<EOS>
They
are
little
addicted
to
drunkenness
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
heard
of
one
riot
since
I
lived
among
them
;
and
murder
and
robbery
are
altogether
unknown
.
<EOS>
A
man
may
walk
alone
over
the
county
of
Nice
,
at
midnight
,
without
danger
of
insult
.
<EOS>
The
police
is
very
well
regulated
.
<EOS>
No
man
is
permitted
to
wear
a
pistol
or
dagger
on
pain
of
being
sent
to
the
gallies
.
<EOS>
I
am
informed
,
that
both
murder
and
robbery
are
very
frequent
in
some
parts
of
Piedmont
.
<EOS>
Even
here
,
when
the
peasants
quarrel
in
their
cups
,
(
which
very
seldom
happens
)
they
draw
their
knives
,
and
the
one
infallibly
stabs
the
other
.
<EOS>
To
such
extremities
,
however
,
they
never
proceed
,
except
when
there
is
a
woman
in
the
case
;
and
mutual
jealousy
co
-
operates
with
the
liquor
they
have
drank
,
to
inflame
their
passions
.
<EOS>
In
Nice
,
the
common
people
retire
to
their
lodgings
at
eight
o'clock
in
winter
,
and
nine
in
summer
.
<EOS>
Every
person
found
in
the
streets
after
these
hours
,
is
apprehended
by
the
patrole
;
and
,
if
he
can
not
give
a
good
account
of
himself
,
sent
to
prison
.
<EOS>
At
nine
in
winter
,
and
ten
in
summer
,
there
is
a
curfew
-
bell
rung
,
warning
the
people
to
put
out
their
lights
,
and
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
very
necessary
precaution
in
towns
subject
to
conflagrations
;
but
of
small
use
in
Nice
,
where
there
is
very
little
combustible
in
the
houses
.
  
<EOS>
The
punishments
inflicted
upon
malefactors
and
delinquents
at
Nice
are
hanging
for
capital
crimes
;
slavery
on
board
the
gallies
for
a
limited
term
,
or
for
life
,
according
to
the
nature
of
the
transgression
;
flagellation
,
and
the
strappado
.
<EOS>
This
last
is
performed
,
by
hoisting
up
the
criminal
by
his
hands
tied
behind
his
back
,
on
a
pulley
about
two
stories
high
;
from
whence
,
the
rope
being
suddenly
slackened
,
he
falls
to
within
a
yard
or
two
of
the
ground
,
where
he
is
stopped
with
a
violent
shock
arising
from
the
weight
of
his
body
,
and
the
velocity
of
his
descent
,
which
generally
dislocates
his
shoulders
,
with
incredible
pain
.
<EOS>
This
dreadful
execution
is
sometimes
repeated
in
a
few
minutes
on
the
same
delinquent
;
so
that
the
very
ligaments
are
tore
from
his
joints
,
and
his
arms
are
rendered
useless
for
life
.
  
<EOS>
The
poverty
of
the
people
in
this
country
,
as
well
as
in
the
South
of
France
,
may
be
conjectured
from
the
appearance
of
their
domestic
animals
.
<EOS>
The
draughthorses
,
mules
,
and
asses
,
of
the
peasants
,
are
so
meagre
,
as
to
excite
compassion
.
<EOS>
There
is
not
a
dog
to
be
seen
in
tolerable
case
;
and
the
cats
are
so
many
emblems
of
famine
,
frightfully
thin
,
and
dangerously
rapacious
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
the
dogs
and
they
do
not
devour
young
children
.
<EOS>
Another
proof
of
that
indigence
which
reigns
among
the
common
people
,
is
this
:
you
may
pass
through
the
whole
South
of
France
,
as
well
as
the
county
of
Nice
,
where
there
is
no
want
of
groves
,
woods
,
and
plantations
,
without
hearing
the
song
of
blackbird
,
thrush
,
linnet
,
gold
-
finch
,
or
any
other
bird
whatsoever
.
<EOS>
All
is
silent
and
solitary
.
<EOS>
The
poor
birds
are
destroyed
,
or
driven
for
refuge
,
into
other
countries
,
by
the
savage
persecution
of
the
people
,
who
spare
no
pains
to
kill
,
and
catch
them
for
their
own
subsistence
.
<EOS>
Scarce
a
sparrow
,
red
-
breast
,
tomtit
,
or
wren
,
can
"
scape
the
guns
and
snares
of
those
indefatigable
fowlers
.
<EOS>
Even
the
noblesse
make
parties
to
go
a
la
chasse
,
a
-
hunting
;
that
is
,
to
kill
those
little
birds
,
which
they
eat
as
gibier
,
or
game
.
  
<EOS>
The
great
poverty
of
the
people
here
,
is
owing
to
their
religion
.
<EOS>
Half
of
their
time
is
lost
in
observing
the
great
number
of
festivals
;
and
half
of
their
substance
is
given
to
mendicant
friars
and
parish
priests
.
<EOS>
But
if
the
church
occasions
their
indigence
,
it
likewise
,
in
some
measure
,
alleviates
the
horrors
of
it
,
by
amusing
them
with
shows
,
processions
,
and
even
those
very
feasts
,
which
afford
a
recess
from
labour
,
in
a
country
where
the
climate
disposes
them
to
idleness
.
<EOS>
If
the
peasants
in
the
neighbourhood
of
any
chapel
dedicated
to
a
saint
,
whose
day
is
to
be
celebrated
,
have
a
mind
to
make
a
festin
,
in
other
words
,
a
fair
,
they
apply
to
the
commandant
of
Nice
for
a
license
,
which
costs
them
about
a
French
crown
.
<EOS>
This
being
obtained
,
they
assemble
after
service
,
men
and
women
,
in
their
best
apparel
,
and
dance
to
the
musick
of
fiddles
,
and
pipe
and
tabor
,
or
rather
pipe
and
drum
.
<EOS>
There
are
hucksters
'
stands
,
with
pedlary
ware
and
knick
-
knacks
for
presents
;
cakes
and
bread
,
liqueurs
and
wine
;
and
thither
generally
resort
all
the
company
of
Nice
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
our
whole
noblesse
at
one
of
these
festins
,
kept
on
the
highway
in
summer
,
mingled
with
an
immense
crowd
of
peasants
,
mules
,
and
asses
,
covered
with
dust
,
and
sweating
at
every
pore
with
the
excessive
heat
of
the
weather
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
much
puzzled
to
tell
whence
their
enjoyment
arises
on
such
occasions
;
or
to
explain
their
motives
for
going
thither
,
unless
they
are
prescribed
it
for
pennance
,
as
a
fore
-
taste
of
purgatory
.
  
<EOS>
Now
I
am
speaking
of
religious
institutions
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
help
observing
,
that
the
antient
Romans
were
still
more
superstitious
than
the
modern
Italians
;
and
that
the
number
of
their
religious
feasts
,
sacrifices
,
fasts
,
and
holidays
,
was
even
greater
than
those
of
the
Christian
church
of
Rome
.
<EOS>
They
had
their
festi
and
profesti
,
their
feriae
stativae
,
and
conceptivae
,
their
fixed
and
moveable
feasts
;
their
esuriales
,
or
fasting
days
,
and
their
precidaneae
,
or
vigils
.
<EOS>
The
agonales
were
celebrated
in
January
;
the
carmentales
,
in
January
and
February
;
the
lupercales
and
matronales
,
in
March
;
the
megalesia
in
April
;
the
floralia
,
in
May
;
and
the
matralia
in
June
.
<EOS>
They
had
their
saturnalia
,
robigalia
,
venalia
,
vertumnalia
,
fornacalia
,
palilia
,
and
laralia
,
their
latinae
,
their
paganales
,
their
sementinae
,
their
compitales
,
and
their
imperativae
;
such
as
the
novemdalia
,
instituted
by
the
senate
,
on
account
of
a
supposed
shower
of
stones
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
every
private
family
had
a
number
of
feriae
,
kept
either
by
way
of
rejoicing
for
some
benefit
,
or
mourning
for
some
calamity
.
<EOS>
Every
time
it
thundered
,
the
day
was
kept
holy
.
<EOS>
Every
ninth
day
was
a
holiday
,
thence
called
nundinae
quasi
novendinae
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
dies
denominalis
,
which
was
the
fourth
of
the
kalends
;
nones
and
ides
of
every
month
,
over
and
above
the
anniversary
of
every
great
defeat
which
the
republic
had
sustained
,
particularly
the
dies
alliensis
,
or
fifteenth
of
the
kalends
of
December
,
on
which
the
Romans
were
totally
defeated
by
the
Gauls
and
Veientes
;
as
Lucan
says
 
et
damnata
diu
Romanis
allia
fastis
,
and
Allia
in
Rome
's
Calendar
condemn'd
.
<EOS>
The
vast
variety
of
their
deities
,
said
to
amount
to
thirty
thousand
,
with
their
respective
rites
of
adoration
,
could
not
fail
to
introduce
such
a
number
of
ceremonies
,
shews
,
sacrifices
,
lustrations
,
and
public
processions
,
as
must
have
employed
the
people
almost
constantly
from
one
end
of
the
year
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
This
continual
dissipation
must
have
been
a
great
enemy
to
industry
;
and
the
people
must
have
been
idle
and
effeminate
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
would
be
no
difficult
matter
to
prove
,
that
there
is
very
little
difference
,
in
point
of
character
,
between
the
antient
and
modern
inhabitants
of
Rome
;
and
that
the
great
figure
which
this
empire
made
of
old
,
was
not
so
much
owing
to
the
intrinsic
virtue
of
its
citizens
,
as
to
the
barbarism
,
ignorance
,
and
imbecility
of
the
nations
they
subdued
.
<EOS>
Instances
of
public
and
private
virtue
I
find
as
frequent
and
as
striking
in
the
history
of
other
nations
,
as
in
the
annals
of
antient
Rome
;
and
now
that
the
kingdoms
and
states
of
Europe
are
pretty
equally
enlightened
,
and
ballanced
in
the
scale
of
political
power
,
I
am
of
opinion
,
that
if
the
most
fortunate
generals
of
the
Roman
commonwealth
were
again
placed
at
the
head
of
the
very
armies
they
once
commanded
,
instead
of
extending
their
conquests
over
all
Europe
and
Asia
,
they
would
hardly
be
able
to
subdue
,
and
retain
under
their
dominion
,
all
the
petty
republics
that
subsist
in
Italy
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
am
tired
with
writing
;
and
I
believe
you

NICE
,
November
10
,
1764
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
DOCTOR
,
 
In
my
enquiries
about
the
revenues
of
Nice
,
I
am
obliged
to
trust
to
the
information
of
the
inhabitants
,
who
are
much
given
to
exaggerate
.
<EOS>
They
tell
me
,
the
revenues
of
this
town
amount
to
one
hundred
thousand
livres
,
or
five
thousand
pounds
sterling
;
of
which
I
would
strike
off
at
least
one
fourth
,
as
an
addition
of
their
own
vanity
:
<EOS>
perhaps
,
if
we
deduct
a
third
,
it
will
be
nearer
the
truth
.
<EOS>
For
,
I
can
not
find
out
any
other
funds
they
have
,
but
the
butchery
and
the
bakery
,
which
they
farm
at
so
much
a
year
to
the
best
bidder
;
and
the
droits
d'entree
,
or
duties
upon
provision
brought
into
the
city
;
but
these
are
very
small
.
<EOS>
The
king
is
said
to
draw
from
Nice
one
hundred
thousand
livres
annually
,
arising
from
a
free
-
gift
,
amounting
to
seven
hundred
pounds
sterling
,
in
lieu
of
the
taille
,
from
which
this
town
and
county
are
exempted
;
an
inconsiderable
duty
upon
wine
sold
in
public
-
houses
;
and
the
droits
du
port
.
<EOS>
These
last
consist
of
anchorage
,
paid
by
all
vessels
in
proportion
to
their
tonnage
,
when
they
enter
the
harbours
of
Nice
and
Villa
Franca
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
all
foreign
vessels
,
under
a
certain
stipulated
burthen
,
that
pass
between
the
island
of
Sardinia
and
this
coast
,
are
obliged
,
in
going
to
the
eastward
,
to
enter
;
and
pay
a
certain
regulated
imposition
,
on
pain
of
being
taken
and
made
prize
.
<EOS>
The
prince
of
Monaco
exacts
a
talliage
of
the
same
kind
;
and
both
he
and
the
king
of
Sardinia
maintain
armed
cruisers
to
assert
this
prerogative
;
from
which
,
however
,
the
English
and
French
are
exempted
by
treaty
,
in
consequence
of
having
paid
a
sum
of
money
at
once
.
<EOS>
In
all
probability
,
it
was
originally
given
as
a
consideration
for
maintaining
lights
on
the
shore
,
for
the
benefit
of
navigators
,
like
the
toll
paid
for
passing
the
Sound
in
the
Baltic
.
<EOS>
[
Upon
further
inquiry
I
find
it
was
given
in
consideration
of
being
protected
from
the
Corsairs
by
the
naval
force
of
the
Duke
of
Savoy
and
Prince
of
Monaco
.
]
<EOS>
The
fanal
,
or
lanthorn
,
to
the
eastward
of
Villa
Franca
,
is
kept
in
good
repair
,
and
still
lighted
in
the
winter
.
<EOS>
The
toll
,
however
,
is
a
very
troublesome
tax
upon
feluccas
,
and
other
small
craft
,
which
are
greatly
retarded
in
their
voyages
,
and
often
lose
the
benefit
of
a
fair
wind
,
by
being
obliged
to
run
inshore
,
and
enter
those
harbours
.
<EOS>
The
tobacco
the
king
manufactures
at
his
own
expence
,
and
sells
for
his
own
profit
,
at
a
very
high
price
;
and
every
person
convicted
of
selling
this
commodity
in
secret
,
is
sent
to
the
gallies
for
life
.
<EOS>
The
salt
comes
chiefly
from
Sardinia
,
and
is
stored
up
in
the
king
's
magazine
from
whence
it
is
exported
to
Piedmont
,
and
other
parts
of
his
inland
dominions
.
<EOS>
And
here
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
observe
,
that
Sardinia
produces
very
good
horses
,
well
-
shaped
,
though
small
;
strong
,
hardy
,
full
of
mettle
,
and
easily
fed
.
<EOS>
The
whole
county
of
Nice
is
said
to
yield
the
king
half
a
million
of
livres
,
about
twenty
-
five
thousand
pounds
sterling
,
arising
from
a
small
donative
made
by
every
town
and
village
:
for
the
lands
pay
no
tax
,
or
imposition
,
but
the
tithes
to
the
church
.
<EOS>
His
revenue
then
flows
from
the
gabelle
on
salt
and
wine
,
and
these
free
-
gifts
;
so
that
we
may
strike
off
one
fifth
of
the
sum
at
which
the
whole
is
estimated
;
and
conclude
,
that
the
king
draws
from
the
county
at
Nice
,
about
four
hundred
thousand
livres
,
or
twenty
thousand
pounds
sterling
.
<EOS>
That
his
revenues
from
Nice
are
not
great
,
appears
from
the
smallness
of
the
appointments
allowed
to
his
officers
.
<EOS>
The
president
has
about
three
hundred
pounds
per
annum
;
and
the
intendant
about
two
.
<EOS>
The
pay
of
the
commandant
does
not
exceed
three
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
:
but
he
has
certain
privileges
called
the
tour
du
baton
,
some
of
which
a
man
of
spirit
would
not
insist
upon
.
<EOS>
He
who
commands
at
present
,
having
no
estate
of
his
own
,
enjoys
a
small
commandery
,
which
being
added
to
his
appointments
at
Nice
,
make
the
whole
amount
to
about
five
hundred
pounds
sterling
.
  
<EOS>
If
we
may
believe
the
politicians
of
Nice
,
the
king
of
Sardinia
's
whole
revenue
does
not
fall
short
of
twenty
millions
of
Piedmontese
livres
,
being
above
one
million
of
our
money
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
owned
,
that
there
is
no
country
in
Christendom
less
taxed
than
that
of
Nice
;
and
as
the
soil
produces
the
necessaries
of
life
,
the
inhabitants
,
with
a
little
industry
,
might
renew
the
golden
age
in
this
happy
climate
,
among
their
groves
,
woods
,
and
mountains
,
beautified
with
fountains
,
brooks
,
rivers
,
torrents
,
and
cascades
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
these
pastoral
advantages
,
the
peasants
are
poor
and
miserable
.
<EOS>
They
have
no
stock
to
begin
the
world
with
.
<EOS>
They
have
no
leases
of
the
lands
they
cultivate
;
but
entirely
depend
,
from
year
to
year
,
on
the
pleasure
of
the
arbitrary
landholder
,
who
may
turn
them
out
at
a
minute
's
warning
;
and
they
are
oppressed
by
the
mendicant
friars
and
parish
priests
,
who
rob
them
of
the
best
fruits
of
their
labour
:
after
all
,
the
ground
is
too
scanty
for
the
number
of
families
which
are
crouded
on
it
.
  
<EOS>
You
desire
to
know
the
state
of
the
arts
and
sciences
at
Nice
;
which
,
indeed
,
is
almost
a
total
blank
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
men
of
talents
<EOS>
this
place
may
have
formerly
produced
;
but
at
present
,
it
seems
to
be
consecrated
to
the
reign
of
dulness
and
superstition
.
<EOS>
It
is
very
surprising
,
to
see
a
people
established
between
two
enlightened
nations
,
so
devoid
of
taste
and
literature
.
<EOS>
Here
are
no
tolerable
pictures
,
busts
,
statues
,
nor
edifices
:
the
very
ornaments
of
the
churches
are
wretchedly
conceived
,
and
worse
executed
.
<EOS>
They
have
no
public
,
nor
private
libraries
that
afford
any
thing
worth
perusing
.
<EOS>
There
is
not
even
a
bookseller
in
Nice
.
<EOS>
Though
they
value
themselves
upon
their
being
natives
of
Italy
,
they
are
unacquainted
with
music
.
<EOS>
The
few
that
play
upon
instruments
,
attend
only
to
the
execution
.
<EOS>
They
have
no
genius
nor
taste
,
nor
any
knowledge
of
harmony
and
composition
.
<EOS>
Among
the
French
,
a
Nissard
piques
himself
on
being
Provencal
;
but
in
Florence
,
Milan
,
or
Rome
,
he
claims
the
honour
of
being
born
a
native
of
Italy
.
<EOS>
The
people
of
condition
here
speak
both
languages
equally
well
;
or
,
rather
,
equally
ill
;
for
they
use
a
low
,
uncouth
phraseology
;
and
their
pronunciation
is
extremely
vitious
.
<EOS>
Their
vernacular
tongue
is
what
they
call
Patois
;
though
in
so
calling
it
,
they
do
it
injustice
.
 
<EOS>
Patois
,
from
the
Latin
word
patavinitas
,
means
no
more
than
a
provincial
accent
,
or
dialect
.
<EOS>
It
takes
its
name
from
Patavium
,
or
Padua
,
which
was
the
birthplace
of
Livy
,
who
,
with
all
his
merit
as
a
writer
,
has
admitted
into
his
history
,
some
provincial
expressions
of
his
own
country
.
<EOS>
The
Patois
,
or
native
tongue
of
Nice
,
is
no
other
than
the
ancient
Provencal
,
from
which
the
Italian
,
Spanish
and
French
languages
,
have
been
formed
.
<EOS>
This
is
the
language
that
rose
upon
the
ruins
of
the
Latin
tongue
,
after
the
irruptions
of
the
Goths
,
Vandals
,
Huns
,
and
Burgundians
,
by
whom
the
Roman
empire
was
destroyed
.
<EOS>
It
was
spoke
all
over
Italy
,
Spain
,
and
the
southern
parts
of
France
,
until
the
thirteenth
century
,
when
the
Italians
began
to
polish
it
into
the
language
which
they
now
call
their
own
:
The
Spaniards
and
French
,
likewise
,
improved
it
into
their
respective
tongues
.
<EOS>
From
its
great
affinity
to
the
Latin
,
it
was
called
Romance
,
a
name
which
the
Spaniards
still
give
to
their
own
language
.
<EOS>
As
the
first
legends
of
knight
-
errantry
were
written
in
Provencal
,
all
subsequent
performances
of
the
same
kind
,
have
derived
from
it
the
name
of
romance
;
and
as
those
annals
of
chivalry
contained
extravagant
adventures
of
knights
,
giants
,
and
necromancers
,
<EOS>
every
improbable
story
or
fiction
is
to
this
day
called
a
romance
.
<EOS>
Mr
Walpole
,
in
his
Catalogue
of
royal
and
noble
Authors
,
has
produced
two
sonnets
in
the
antient
Provencal
,
written
by
our
king
Richard
I
surnamed
Coeur
de
Lion
;
and
Voltaire
,
in
his
Historical
Tracts
,
has
favoured
the
world
with
some
specimens
of
the
same
language
.
<EOS>
The
Patois
of
Nice
,
must
,
without
doubt
,
have
undergone
changes
and
corruptions
in
the
course
of
so
many
ages
,
especially
as
no
pains
have
been
taken
to
preserve
its
original
purity
,
either
in
orthography
or
pronunciation
.
<EOS>
It
is
neglected
,
as
the
language
of
the
vulgar
:
and
scarce
any
-
body
here
knows
either
its
origin
or
constitution
.
<EOS>
I
have
in
vain
endeavoured
to
procure
some
pieces
in
the
antient
Provencal
,
that
I
might
compare
them
with
the
modern
Patois
:
but
I
can
find
no
person
to
give
me
the
least
information
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
The
shades
of
ignorance
,
sloth
,
and
stupidity
,
are
impenetrable
.
<EOS>
Almost
every
word
of
the
Patois
may
still
be
found
in
the
Italian
,
Spanish
,
and
French
languages
,
with
a
small
change
in
the
pronunciation
.
<EOS>
Cavallo
,
signifying
a
horse
in
Italian
and
Spanish
is
called
cavao
;
maison
,
the
French
word
for
a
house
,
is
changed
into
maion
;
aqua
,
which
means
water
in
Spanish
,
the
Nissards
call
daigua
.
<EOS>
To
express
,
what
a
slop
is
here
!
<EOS>
they
say
acco
fa
lac
aqui
,
which
is
a
sentence
composed
of
two
Italian
words
,
one
French
,
and
one
Spanish
.
<EOS>
This
is
nearly
the
proportion
in
which
these
three
languages
will
be
found
mingled
in
the
Patois
of
Nice
;
which
,
with
some
variation
,
extends
over
all
Provence
,
Languedoc
,
and
Gascony
.
<EOS>
I
will
now
treat
you
with
two
or
three
stanzas
of
a
canzon
,
or
hymn
,
in
this
language
,
to
the
Virgin
Mary
,
which
was
lately
printed
at
Nice
.

NICE
,
November

1764
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
I
had
once
thoughts
of
writing
a
complete
natural
history
of
this
town
and
county
:
<EOS>
but
I
found
myself
altogether
unequal
to
the
task
.
<EOS>
I
have
neither
health
,
strength
,
nor
opportunity
to
make
proper
collections
of
the
mineral
,
vegetable
,
and
animal
productions
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
much
conversant
with
these
branches
of
natural
philosophy
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
books
to
direct
my
inquiries
.
<EOS>
I
can
find
no
person
capable
of
giving
me
the
least
information
or
assistance
;
and
I
am
strangely
puzzled
by
the
barbarous
names
they
give
to
many
different
species
,
the
descriptions
of
which
I
have
read
under
other
appelations
;
and
which
,
as
I
have
never
seen
them
before
,
I
can
not
pretend
to
distinguish
by
the
eye
.
<EOS>
You
must
therefore
be
contented
with
such
imperfect
intelligence
as
my
opportunities
can
afford
.
  
<EOS>
The
useful
arts
practised
at
Nice
,
are
these
,
gardening
and
agriculture
,
with
their
consequences
,
the
making
of
wine
,
oil
,
and
cordage
;
the
rearing
of
silk
-
worms
,
with
the
subsequent
management
and
manufacture
of
that
production
;
and
the
fishing
,
which
I
have
already
described
.
  
<EOS>
Nothing
can
be
more
unpromising
than
the
natural
soil
of
this
territory
,
except
in
a
very
few
narrow
bottoms
,
where
there
is
a
stiff
clay
,
which
when
carefully
watered
,
yields
tolerable
pasturage
.
<EOS>
In
every
other
part
,
the
soil
consists
of
a
light
sand
mingled
with
pebbles
,
which
serves
well
enough
for
the
culture
of
vines
and
olives
:
but
the
ground
laid
out
for
kitchen
herbs
,
as
well
as
for
other
fruit
must
be
manured
with
great
care
and
attention
.
<EOS>
They
have
no
black
cattle
to
afford
such
compost
as
our
farmers
use
in
England
.
<EOS>
The
dung
of
mules
and
asses
,
which
are
their
only
beasts
of
burthen
,
is
of
very
little
value
for
this
purpose
;
and
the
natural
sterility
of
their
ground
requires
something
highly
impregnated
with
nitre
and
volatile
salts
.
<EOS>
They
have
recourse
therefore
to
pigeons
'
dung
and
ordure
,
which
fully
answer
their
expectations
.
<EOS>
Every
peasant
opens
,
at
one
corner
of
his
wall
,
a
public
house
of
office
for
the
reception
of
passengers
;
and
in
the
town
of
Nice
,
every
 
tenement
is
provided
with
one
of
these
receptacles
,
the
contents
of
which
are
carefully
preserved
for
sale
.
<EOS>
The
peasant
comes
with
his
asses
and
casks
to
carry
it
off
before
day
,
and
pays
for
it
according
to
its
quality
,
which
he
examines
and
investigates
,
by
the
taste
and
flavour
.
<EOS>
The
jakes
of
a
protestant
family
,
who
eat
gras
every
day
,
bears
a
much
higher
price
than
the
privy
of
a
good
catholic
who
lives
maigre
one
half
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
The
vaults
belonging
to
the
convent
of
Minims
are
not
worth
emptying
.
  
<EOS>
The
ground
here
is
not
delved
with
spades
as
in
England
,
but
laboured
with
a
broad
,
sharp
hough
,
having
a
short
horizontal
handle
;
and
the
climate
is
so
hot
and
dry
in
the
summer
,
that
the
plants
must
be
watered
every
morning
and
evening
,
especially
where
it
is
not
shaded
by
trees
.
<EOS>
It
is
surprising
to
see
how
the
productions
of
the
earth
are
crouded
together
.
<EOS>
One
would
imagine
they
would
rob
one
another
of
nourishment
;
and
moreover
be
stifled
for
want
of
air
;
and
doubtless
this
is
in
some
measure
the
case
.
<EOS>
Olive
and
other
fruit
trees
are
planted
in
rows
very
close
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
These
are
connected
by
vines
,
and
the
interstices
,
between
the
rows
,
are
filled
with
corn
.
<EOS>
The
gardens
that
supply
the
town
with
sallad
and
pot
-
herbs
,
lye
all
on
the
side
of
Provence
,
by
the
highway
.
<EOS>
They
are
surrounded
with
high
stone
-
walls
,
or
ditches
,
planted
with
a
kind
of
cane
or
large
reed
,
which
answers
many
purposes
in
this
country
.
<EOS>
The
leaves
of
it
afford
sustenance
to
the
asses
,
and
the
canes
not
only
serve
as
fences
to
the
inclosures
;
but
are
used
to
prop
the
vines
and
pease
,
and
to
build
habitations
for
the
silkworms
<EOS>
:
they
are
formed
into
arbours
,
and
wore
as
walking
-
staves
.
<EOS>
All
these
gardens
are
watered
by
little
rills
that
come
from
the
mountains
,
particularly
,
by
the
small
branches
of
the
two
sources
which
I
have
described
in
a
former
letter
,
as
issuing
from
the
two
sides
of
a
mountain
,
under
the
names
of
Fontaine
de
Muraille
,
and
Fontaine
du
Temple
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
neighbourhood
of
Nice
,
they
raise
a
considerable
quantity
of
hemp
,
the
largest
and
strongest
I
ever
saw
.
<EOS>
Part
of
this
,
when
dressed
,
is
exported
to
other
countries
;
and
part
is
manufactured
into
cordage
.
<EOS>
However
profitable
it
may
be
to
the
grower
,
it
is
certainly
a
great
nuisance
in
the
summer
.
<EOS>
When
taken
out
of
the
pits
,
where
it
has
been
put
to
rot
,
the
stench
it
raises
is
quite
insupportable
;
and
must
undoubtedly
be
unwholesome
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
such
a
want
of
land
in
this
neighbourhood
,
that
terraces
are
built
over
one
another
with
loose
stones
,
on
the
faces
of
bare
rocks
,
and
these
being
covered
with
earth
and
manured
,
are
planted
with
olives
,
vines
,
and
corn
.
<EOS>
The
same
shift
was
practised
all
over
Palestine
,
which
was
rocky
and
barren
,
and
much
more
populous
than
the
county
of
Nice
.
  
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
small
extent
of
this
territory
,
there
are
some
pleasant
meadows
in
the
skirts
of
Nice
,
that
produce
excellent
clover
;
and
the
corn
which
is
sown
in
open
fields
,
where
it
has
the
full
benefit
of
the
soil
,
sun
,
and
air
,
grows
to
a
surprizing
height
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
rye
seven
or
eight
feet
high
.
<EOS>
All
vegetables
have
a
wonderful
growth
in
this
climate
.
<EOS>
Besides
wheat
,
rye
,
barley
,
and
oats
,
this
country
produces
a
good
deal
of
Meliga
,
or
Turkish
wheat
,
which
is
what
we
call
Indian
corn
.
<EOS>
I
have
,
in
a
former
letter
,
observed
that
the
meal
of
this
grain
goes
by
the
name
polenta
,
and
makes
excellent
hasty
-
pudding
,
being
very
nourishing
,
and
counted
an
admirable
pectoral
.
<EOS>
The
pods
and
stalks
are
used
for
fuel
:
and
the
leaves
are
much
preferable
to
common
straw
,
for
making
paillasses
.
  
<EOS>
The
pease
and
beans
in
the
garden
appear
in
the
winter
like
beautiful
plantations
of
young
trees
in
blossom
;
and
perfume
the
air
.
<EOS>
Myrtle
,
sweet
-
briar
,
sweet
-
marjoram
,
sage
,
thyme
,
lavender
,
rosemary
,
with
many
other
aromatic
herbs
and
flowers
,
which
with
us
require
the
most
careful
cultivation
,
are
here
found
wild
in
the
mountains
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
not
many
years
since
the
Nissards
learned
the
culture
of
silk
-
worms
,
of
their
neighbours
the
Piedmontese
;
and
hitherto
the
progress
they
have
made
is
not
very
considerable
:
the
whole
county
of
Nice
produces
about
one
hundred
and
thirty
-
three
bales
of
three
hundred
pounds
each
,
amounting
in
value
to
four
hundred
thousand
livres
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
beginning
of
April
,
when
the
mulberry
-
leaves
,
begin
to
put
forth
,
the
eggs
or
grains
that
produce
the
silk
-
worm
,
are
hatched
.
<EOS>
The
grains
are
washed
in
wine
,
and
those
that
swim
on
the
top
,
are
thrown
away
as
good
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
The
rest
being
deposited
in
small
bags
of
linen
,
are
worn
by
women
in
their
bosoms
,
until
the
worms
begin
to
appear
:
then
they
are
placed
in
shallow
wooden
boxes
,
covered
with
a
piece
of
white
paper
,
cut
into
little
holes
,
through
which
the
worms
ascend
as
they
are
hatched
,
to
feed
on
the
young
mulberry
-
leaves
,
of
which
there
is
a
layer
above
the
paper
.
<EOS>
These
boxes
are
kept
for
warmth
between
two
mattrasses
,
and
visited
every
day
.
<EOS>
Fresh
leaves
are
laid
in
,
and
the
worms
that
feed
are
removed
successively
to
the
other
place
prepared
for
their
reception
.
<EOS>
This
is
an
habitation
,
consisting
of
two
or
three
stories
,
about
twenty
inches
from
each
other
,
raised
upon
four
wooden
posts
.
<EOS>
The
floors
are
made
of
canes
,
and
strewed
with
fresh
mulberry
-
leaves
:
the
corner
posts
,
and
other
occasional
props
,
for
sustaining
the
different
floors
,
are
covered
with
a
coat
of
loose
heath
,
which
is
twisted
round
the
wood
.
<EOS>
The
worms
when
hatched
are
laid
upon
the
floors
;
and
here
you
may
see
them
in
all
the
different
stages
(
if
moulting
or
casting
the
slough
,
a
change
which
they
undergo
three
times
successively
before
they
begin
to
work
.
<EOS>
The
silk
-
worm
is
an
animal
of
such
acute
and
delicate
sensations
,
that
too
much
care
can
not
be
taken
to
keep
its
habitation
clean
,
and
to
refresh
it
from
time
to
time
with
pure
air
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
them
languish
and
die
in
scores
,
in
consequence
of
an
accidental
bad
smell
.
<EOS>
The
soiled
leaves
,
and
the
filth
which
they
necessarily
produce
,
should
be
carefully
shifted
every
day
;
and
it
would
not
be
amiss
to
purify
the
air
sometimes
with
fumes
of
vinegar
,
rose
,
or
orange
-
flower
water
.
<EOS>
These
niceties
,
however
,
are
but
little
observed
.
<EOS>
They
commonly
lie
in
heaps
as
thick
as
shrimps
in
a
plate
,
some
feeding
on
the
leaves
,
some
new
hatched
,
some
intranced
in
the
agonies
of
casting
their
skin
,
sonic
languishing
,
and
some
actually
dead
,
with
a
litter
of
half
-
eaten
faded
leaves
about
them
,
in
a
close
room
,
crouded
with
women
and
children
,
not
at
all
remarkable
for
their
cleanliness
.
<EOS>
I
am
assured
by
some
persons
of
credit
,
that
if
they
are
touched
,
or
even
approached
,
by
a
woman
in
her
catamenia
,
they
infallibly
expire
.
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
must
be
understood
of
those
females
whose
skins
have
naturally
a
very
rank
flavour
,
which
is
generally
heightened
at
such
periods
.
<EOS>
The
mulberry
-
leaves
used
in
this
country
are
of
the
tree
which
bears
a
small
white
fruit
not
larger
than
a
damascene
.
<EOS>
They
are
planted
on
purpose
,
and
the
leaves
are
sold
at
so
much
a
pound
.
<EOS>
By
the
middle
of
June
all
the
mulberry
-
trees
are
stripped
;
but
new
leaves
succeed
,
and
in
a
few
weeks
,
they
are
cloathed
again
with
fresh
verdure
.
<EOS>
In
about
ten
days
after
the
last
moulting
,
the
silk
-
worm
climbs
upon
the
props
of
his
house
,
and
choosing
a
situation
among
the
heath
,
begins
to
spin
in
a
most
curious
manner
,
until
he
is
quite
inclosed
,
  
and
the
cocon
or
pod
of
silk
,
about
the
size
of
a
pigeon
's
egg
,
which
he
has
produced
remains
suspended
by
several
filaments
.
<EOS>
It
is
no
unusual
to
see
double
cocons
,
spun
by
two
worms
included
under
a
common
cover
.
<EOS>
There
must
be
an
infinite
number
of
worms
to
yield
any
considerable
quantity
of
silk
.
<EOS>
One
ounce
of
eggs
or
grains
produces
,
four
rup
,
or
one
hundred
Nice
pounds
of
cocons
;
and
one
rup
,
or
twenty
-
five
pounds
of
cocons
,
if
they
are
rich
,
gives
three
pounds
of
raw
silk
;
that
is
,
twelve
pounds
of
silk
are
got
from
one
ounce
of
grains
,
which
ounce
of
grains
its
produced
by
as
many
worms
as
are
inclosed
in
one
pound
,
or
twelve
ounces
of
cocons
.
<EOS>
In
preserving
the
cocons
for
breed
,
you
must
choose
an
equal
number
of
males
and
females
;
and
these
are
very
easily
distinguished
by
the
shape
of
the
cocons
;
that
which
contains
the
male
is
sharp
,
and
the
other
obtuse
,
at
the
two
ends
.
<EOS>
In
ten
or
twelve
days
after
the
cocon
is
finished
,
the
worm
makes
its
way
through
it
,
in
the
form
of
a
very
ugly
,
unwieldy
,
aukward
butterfly
,
and
as
the
different
sexes
are
placed
by
one
another
on
paper
or
linen
,
they
immediately
engender
.
<EOS>
The
female
lays
her
eggs
,
which
are
carefully
preserved
;
but
neither
she
nor
her
mate
takes
any
nourishment
,
and
in
eight
or
ten
days
after
they
quit
the
cocons
,
they
generally
die
.
<EOS>
The
silk
of
these
cocons
can
not
be
wound
,
because
the
animals
in
piercing
through
them
,
have
destroyed
the
continuity
of
the
filaments
.
<EOS>
It
is
therefore
,
first
boiled
,
and
then
picked
and
carded
like
wool
,
and
being
afterwards
spun
,
is
used
in
the
coarser
stuffs
of
the
silk
manufacture
.
<EOS>
The
other
cocons
,
which
yield
the
best
silk
,
are
managed
in
a
different
manner
.
<EOS>
Before
the
inclosed
worm
has
time
to
penetrate
,
the
silk
is
reeled
off
with
equal
care
and
ingenuity
.
<EOS>
A
handful
of
the
cocons
are
thrown
away
into
a
kettle
of
boiling
water
,
which
not
only
kills
the
animal
,
but
dissolves
the
glutinous
substance
by
which
the
fine
filaments
of
the
silk
cohere
or
stick
together
,
so
that
they
are
easily
wound
off
,
without
breaking
.
<EOS>
Six
or
seven
of
these
small
filaments
being
joined
together
are
passed
over
a
kind
of
twisting
iron
,
and
fixed
to
the
wheel
,
which
one
girl
turns
,
while
another
,
with
her
hands
in
the
boiling
water
,
disentangles
the
threads
,
joins
them
when
they
chance
to
break
,
and
supplies
fresh
cocons
with
admirable
dexterity
and
dispatch
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
manufacture
of
this
kind
just
without
one
of
the
gates
of
Nice
,
where
forty
or
fifty
of
these
wheels
are
worked
together
,
and
give
employment
for
some
weeks
to
double
the
number
of
young
women
.
<EOS>
Those
who
manage
the
pods
that
float
in
the
boiling
water
must
be
very
alert
,
otherwise
they
will
scald
their
fingers
.
<EOS>
The
smell
that
comes
from
the
boiling
cocons
is
extremely
offensive
.
<EOS>
Hard
by
the
harbour
,
there
is
a
very
curious
mill
for
twisting
the
silk
,
which
goes
by
water
.
<EOS>
There
is
in
the
town
of
Nice
,
a
well
regulated
hospital
for
poor
orphans
of
both
sexes
,
where
above
one
hundred
of
them
are
employed
in
dressing
,
dyeing
,
spinning
,
and
weaving
the
silk
.
<EOS>
In
the
villages
of
Provence
,
you
see
the
poor
women
in
the
streets
spinning
raw
silk
upon
distaves
:
but
here
the
same
instrument
is
only
used
for
spinning
hemp
and
flax
;
which
last
,
however
,
is
not
of
the
growth
of
Nice
 
<EOS>
But
lest
I
should
spin
this
letter
to
a
tedious
length
,
I
will
now
wind
up
my
bottom
,
and
bid
you
heartily
farewell
.

NICE
,
December

<EOS>
SIR
,
 
<EOS>
In
my
last
,
I
gave
you
a
succinct
account
of
the
silkworm
,
and
the
management
of
that
curious
insect
in
this
country
.
<EOS>
I
shall
now
proceed
to
describe
the
methods
of
making
wine
and
oil
.
  
<EOS>
The
vintage
begins
in
September
.
<EOS>
The
grapes
being
chosen
and
carefully
picked
,
are
put
into
a
large
vat
,
where
they
are
pressed
by
a
man
's
naked
feet
,
and
the
juices
drawn
off
by
a
cock
below
.
<EOS>
When
no
more
is
procured
by
this
operation
,
the
bruised
grapes
are
put
into
the
press
,
and
yield
still
more
liquor
.
<EOS>
The
juice
obtained
by
this
double
pressure
,
being
put
in
casks
,
with
their
bungs
open
,
begins
to
ferment
and
discharge
its
impurities
at
the
openings
.
<EOS>
The
waste
occasioned
by
this
discharge
,
is
constantly
supplied
with
fresh
wine
,
so
that
the
casks
are
always
full
.
<EOS>
The
fermentation
continues
for
twelve
,
fifteen
,
or
twenty
days
,
according
to
the
strength
and
vigour
of
the
grape
.
<EOS>
In
about
a
month
,
the
wine
is
fit
for
drinking
.
<EOS>
When
the
grapes
are
of
a
bad
,
meagre
kind
,
the
wine
dealers
mix
the
juice
with
pigeons'-dung
or
quick
-
lime
,
in
order
to
give
it
a
spirit
which
nature
has
denied
:
but
this
is
a
very
mischievous
adulteration
.
  
<EOS>
The
process
for
oil
-
making
is
equally
simple
.
<EOS>
The
best
olives
are
those
that
grow
wild
;
but
the
quantity
of
them
is
very
inconsiderable
.
<EOS>
Olives
begin
to
ripen
and
drop
in
the
beginning
of
November
:
but
some
remain
on
the
trees
till
February
,
and
even
till
April
,
and
these
are
counted
the
most
valuable
.
<EOS>
When
the
olives
are
gathered
,
they
must
be
manufactured
immediately
,
before
they
fade
and
grow
wrinkled
,
otherwise
they
will
produce
bad
oil
.
<EOS>
They
are
first
of
all
ground
into
a
paste
by
a
mill
-
stone
set
edge
-
ways
in
a
circular
stone
-
trough
,
the
wheel
being
turned
by
water
.
  
<EOS>
This
paste
is
put
into
trails
or
circular
cases
made
of
grass
woven
,
having
a
round
hole
at
top
and
bottom
;
when
filled
they
resemble
in
shape
our
Cheshire
cheeses
.
<EOS>
A
number
of
these
placed
one
upon
another
,
are
put
in
a
press
,
and
being
squeezed
,
the
oil
with
all
its
impurities
,
runs
into
a
receptacle
below
fixed
in
the
ground
.
<EOS>
From
hence
it
is
laded
into
a
wooden
vat
,
half
filled
with
water
.
<EOS>
The
sordes
or
dirt
falls
to
the
bottom
;
the
oil
swims
a
-
top
;
and
being
skimmed
off
,
is
barrelled
up
in
small
oblong
casks
.
<EOS>
What
remains
in
the
vat
,
is
thrown
into
a
large
stone
cistern
with
water
,
and
after
being
often
stirred
,
and
standing
twelve
or
fourteen
days
,
yields
a
coarser
oil
used
for
lamps
and
manufactures
.
<EOS>
After
these
processes
,
they
extract
an
oil
still
more
coarse
and
fetid
from
the
refuse
of
the
whole
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
in
order
to
make
the
olives
grind
the
more
easily
into
a
paste
,
and
part
with
more
oil
,
they
are
mixed
with
a
little
hot
water
:
but
the
oil
thus
procured
is
apt
to
grow
rancid
.
<EOS>
The
very
finest
,
called
virgin
oil
,
is
made
chiefly
of
green
olives
,
and
sold
at
a
very
high
price
,
because
a
great
quantity
is
required
to
produce
a
very
little
oil
.
<EOS>
Even
the
stuff
that
is
left
after
all
these
operations
,
consisting
of
the
dried
pulp
,
is
sold
for
fuel
,
and
used
in
brasieres
for
warming
apartments
which
have
no
chimney
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
now
specified
all
the
manufactures
of
Nice
which
are
worth
mentioning
.
<EOS>
True
it
is
,
there
is
some
coarse
paper
made
in
this
neighbourhood
;
there
are
also
people
here
who
dress
skins
and
make
leather
for
the
use
of
the
inhabitants
:
but
this
business
is
very
ill
performed
:
the
gloves
and
shoes
are
generally
rotten
as
they
come
from
the
hands
of
the
maker
.
<EOS>
Carpenter
's
,
joiner
's
,
and
blacksmith
's
work
is
very
coarsely
and
clumsily
done
.
<EOS>
There
are
no
chairs
to
be
had
at
Nice
,
but
crazy
things
made
of
a
few
sticks
,
with
rush
bottoms
,
which
are
sold
for
twelve
livres
a
dozen
.
<EOS>
Nothing
can
be
more
contemptible
than
the
hard
-
ware
made
in
this
place
,
such
as
knives
,
scissors
,
and
candle
-
snuffers
.
<EOS>
All
utensils
in
brass
and
copper
are
very
ill
made
and
finished
.
<EOS>
The
silver
-
smiths
make
nothing
but
spoons
,
forks
,
paultry
rings
,
and
crosses
for
the
necks
of
the
women
.
  
<EOS>
The
houses
are
built
of
a
ragged
stone
dug
from
the
mountains
,
and
the
interstices
are
filled
with
rubble
;
so
that
the
walls
would
appear
very
ugly
,
if
they
were
not
covered
with
plaister
,
which
has
a
good
effect
.
<EOS>
They
generally
consist
of
three
stories
,
and
are
covered
with
tiles
.
<EOS>
The
apartments
of
the
better
sort
are
large
and
lofty
,
the
floors
paved
with
brick
,
the
roofs
covered
with
a
thick
coat
of
stucco
,
and
the
walls
whitewashed
.
<EOS>
People
of
distinction
hang
their
chambers
with
damask
,
striped
silk
,
painted
cloths
,
tapestry
,
or
printed
linnen
.
<EOS>
All
the
doors
,
as
well
as
the
windows
,
consist
of
folding
leaves
.
<EOS>
As
there
is
no
wainscot
in
the
rooms
,
which
are
divided
by
stone
partitions
and
the
floors
and
cieling
are
covered
with
brick
and
stucco
,
fires
are
of
much
less
dreadful
consequence
here
than
in
our
country
.
<EOS>
Wainscot
would
afford
harbour
for
bugs
:
besides
,
white
walls
have
a
better
effect
in
this
hot
climate
.
<EOS>
The
beds
commonly
used
in
this
place
,
and
all
over
Italy
,
consist
of
a
paillasse
,
with
one
or
two
mattrasses
,
laid
upon
planks
,
supported
by
two
wooden
benches
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
curtains
there
is
a
couziniere
or
mosquito
net
,
made
of
a
kind
of
gauze
,
that
opens
and
contracts
occasionally
,
and
incloses
the
place
where
you
lie
:
persons
of
condition
,
however
,
have
also
bedsteads
and
curtains
;
but
these
last
are
never
used
in
the
summer
.
  
<EOS>
In
these
countries
,
people
of
all
ranks
dine
exactly
at
noon
;
and
this
is
the
time
I
seize
in
winter
,
for
making
my
daily
tour
of
the
streets
and
ramparts
,
which
at
all
other
hours
of
the
day
are
crowded
with
men
,
women
,
children
and
beasts
of
burthen
.
<EOS>
The
rampart
is
the
common
road
for
carriages
of
all
kinds
.
<EOS>
I
think
there
are
two
private
coaches
in
Nice
,
besides
that
of
the
commandant
:
but
there
are
sedan
chairs
,
which
may
be
had
at
a
reasonable
rate
.
<EOS>
When
I
bathed
in
the
summer
,
I
paid
thirty
sols
,
equal
to
eighteen
-
pence
,
for
being
carried
to
and
from
the
bathing
place
,
which
was
a
mile
from
my
own
house
.
  
<EOS>
Now
I
am
speaking
of
bathing
,
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
inform
you
that
though
there
is
a
fine
open
beach
,
extending
several
miles
to
the
westward
of
Nice
,
those
who
can
not
swim
ought
to
bathe
with
great
precaution
,
as
the
sea
is
very
deep
,
and
the
descent
very
abrupt
from
within
a
yard
or
two
of
the
water
's
edge
.
<EOS>
The
people
here
were
much
surprised
when
I
began
to
bathe
in
the
beginning
of
<EOS>
May.
They
thought
it
very
strange
,
that
a
man
seemingly
consumptive
should
plunge
into
the
sea
,
especially
when
the
weather
was
so
cold
;
and
some
of
the
doctors
prognosticated
immediate
death
.
<EOS>
But
,
when
it
was
perceived
that
I
grew
better
in
consequence
of
the
bath
,
some
of
the
Swiss
officers
tried
the
same
experiment
,
and
in
a
few
days
,
our
example
was
followed
by
several
inhabitants
of
Nice
.
<EOS>
There
is
,
however
,
no
convenience
for
this
operation
,
from
the
benefit
of
which
the
fair
sex
must
be
intirely
excluded
,
unless
they
lay
aside
all
regard
to
decorum
;
for
the
shore
is
always
lined
with
fishing
-
boats
,
and
crouded
with
people
.
<EOS>
If
a
lady
should
be
at
the
expence
of
having
a
tent
pitched
on
the
beach
where
she
might
put
on
and
of
her
bathing
-
dress
,
she
could
not
pretend
to
go
into
the
sea
without
proper
attendants
;
nor
could
she
possibly
plunge
headlong
into
the
water
,
which
is
the
most
effectual
,
and
least
dangerous
way
of
bathing
.
<EOS>
All
that
she
can
do
is
to
have
the
sea
-
water
brought
into
her
house
,
and
make
use
of
a
bathing
-
tub
,
which
may
be
made
according
to
her
own
,
or
physician
's
direction
.
  
<EOS>
What
further
I
have
to
say
of
this
climate
and
country
,
you
shall
have
in
my
next
;
and
then
you
will
be
released
from
a
subject
,
which
I
am
afraid
<EOS>
has
been
but
too
circumstantially
handled
by
  
Sir
,
Your
very
humble
servant
.
   
<EOS>
NICE
,
January
4
,
1765
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
.
<EOS>
,
 
<EOS>
The
constitution
of
this
climate
may
be
pretty
well
ascertained
,
from
the
inclosed
register
of
the
weather
,
which
I
kept
with
all
possible
care
and
attention
.
<EOS>
From
a
perusal
of
it
,
you
will
see
that
there
is
less
rain
and
wind
at
Nice
,
than
in
any
other
part
of
the
world
that
I
know
;
and
such
is
the
serenity
of
the
air
,
that
you
see
nothing
above
your
head
for
several
months
together
,
but
a
charming
blue
expanse
,
without
cloud
or
speck
.
<EOS>
Whatever
clouds
may
be
formed
by
evaporation
of
the
sea
,
they
seldom
or
never
hover
over
this
small
territory
;
but
,
in
all
probability
,
are
attracted
by
the
mountains
that
surround
it
,
and
there
fall
in
rain
or
snow
:
<EOS>
as
for
those
that
gather
from
other
quarters
,
I
suppose
their
progress
hitherward
is
obstructed
by
those
very
Alps
,
which
rise
one
over
another
,
to
an
extent
of
many
leagues
.
<EOS>
This
air
being
dry
,
pure
,
heavy
,
and
elastic
,
must
be
agreeable
to
the
constitution
of
those
who
labour
under
disorders
arising
from
weak
nerves
,
obstructed
perspiration
,
relaxed
fibres
,
a
viscidity
of
lymph
,
and
a
languid
circulation
.
<EOS>
In
other
respects
,
it
encourages
the
scurvy
,
the
atmosphere
being
undoubtedly
impregnated
with
sea
-
salt
.
<EOS>
Ever
since
my
arrival
at
Nice
,
I
have
had
a
scorbutical
eruption
on
my
right
hand
,
which
diminishes
and
increases
according
to
the
state
of
my
health
.
<EOS>
One
day
last
summer
,
when
there
was
a
strong
breeze
from
the
sea
,
the
surface
of
our
bodies
was
covered
with
a
salt
brine
,
very
perceptible
to
the
taste
;
my
gums
,
as
well
as
those
of
another
person
in
my
family
,
began
to
swell
,
and
grow
painful
,
though
this
had
never
happened
before
;
and
I
was
seized
with
violent
pains
in
the
joints
of
my
knees
.
<EOS>
I
was
then
at
a
country
-
house
fronting
the
sea
,
and
particularly
exposed
to
the
marine
air
.
<EOS>
The
swelling
of
our
gums
subsided
as
the
wind
fell
:
but
what
was
very
remarkable
,
the
scurvy
-
spot
on
my
hand
disappeared
,
and
did
not
return
for
a
whole
month
.
<EOS>
It
is
affirmed
that
sea
-
salt
will
dissolve
,
and
render
the
blood
so
fluid
,
that
it
will
exude
through
the
coats
of
the
vessels
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
sea
-
scurvy
is
a
partial
dissolution
of
it
,
by
that
mineral
absorbed
from
the
air
by
the
lymphatics
on
the
surface
of
the
body
,
and
by
those
of
the
lungs
in
respiration
.
<EOS>
Certain
it
is
,
in
the
last
stages
of
the
sea
-
scurvy
,
the
blood
often
bursts
from
the
pores
;
and
this
phaenomenon
is
imputed
to
a
high
degree
of
putrefaction
:
sure
enough
it
is
attended
with
putrefaction
.
<EOS>
We
know
that
a
certain
quantity
of
salt
is
required
to
preserve
the
animal
juices
from
going
putrid
:
<EOS>
but
,
how
a
greater
quantity
should
produce
putrefaction
,
I
leave
to
wiser
heads
to
explain
.
<EOS>
Many
people
here
have
scorbutical
complaints
,
though
their
teeth
are
not
affected
.
<EOS>
They
are
subject
to
eruptions
on
the
skin
,
putrid
gums
,
pains
in
the
bones
,
lassitude
,
indigestion
,
and
low
spirits
;
but
the
reigning
distemper
is
a
marasmus
,
or
consumption
,
which
proceeds
gradually
,
without
any
pulmonary
complaint
,
the
complexion
growing
more
and
more
florid
,
 
'
till
the
very
last
scene
of
the
tragedy
.
<EOS>
This
I
would
impute
to
the
effects
of
a
very
dry
,
saline
atmosphere
,
upon
a
thin
habit
,
in
which
there
is
an
extraordinary
waste
by
perspiration
.
<EOS>
The
air
is
remarkably
salt
in
this
district
,
because
the
mountains
that
hem
it
in
,
prevent
its
communication
with
the
circumambient
atmosphere
,
in
which
the
saline
particles
would
otherwise
be
diffused
;
and
there
is
no
rain
,
nor
dew
,
to
precipitate
or
dissolve
them
.
<EOS>
Such
an
air
as
I
have
described
,
should
have
no
bad
effect
upon
a
moist
,
phlegmatic
constitution
,
such
as
mine
;
and
yet
it
must
be
owned
,
I
have
been
visibly
wasting
since
I
came
hither
,
though
this
decay
I
considered
as
the
progress
of
the
tabes
which
began
in
England
.
<EOS>
But
the
air
of
Nice
has
had
a
still
more
sensible
effect
upon
Mr
Sch
--
z
,
who
laboured
under
nervous
complaints
to
such
a
degree
,
that
life
was
a
burthen
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
also
a
fixed
pain
in
his
breast
,
for
which
complaint
<EOS>
he
had
formerly
tried
the
air
of
Naples
,
where
he
resided
some
considerable
time
,
and
in
a
great
measure
recovered
:
but
,
this
returning
with
weakness
,
faintness
,
low
spirits
,
and
entire
loss
of
appetite
,
he
was
advised
to
come
hither
;
and
the
success
of
his
journey
has
greatly
exceeded
his
expectation
.
<EOS>
Though
the
weather
has
been
remarkably
bad
for
this
climate
,
he
has
enjoyed
perfect
health
.
<EOS>
Since
he
arrived
at
Nice
,
the
pain
in
his
breast
has
vanished
;
he
eats
heartily
,
sleeps
well
,
is
in
high
spirits
,
and
so
strong
,
that
he
is
never
off
his
legs
in
the
day
-
time
.
<EOS>
He
can
walk
to
the
Var
and
back
again
,
before
dinner
;
and
he
has
climbed
to
the
tops
of
all
the
mountains
in
this
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
I
never
saw
before
such
sudden
and
happy
effects
from
the
change
of
air
.
<EOS>
I
must
also
acknowledge
,
that
ever
since
my
arrival
at
Nice
,
I
have
breathed
more
freely
than
I
had
done
for
some
years
,
and
my
spirits
have
been
more
alert
.
<EOS>
The
father
of
my
housekeeper
,
who
was
a
dancing
-
master
,
had
been
so
afflicted
with
an
asthmatic
disorder
,
that
he
could
not
live
in
France
,
Spain
,
or
Italy
;
but
found
the
air
of
Nice
so
agreeable
to
his
lungs
,
that
he
was
enabled
to
exercise
his
profession
for
above
twenty
years
,
and
died
last
spring
turned
of
seventy
.
<EOS>
Another
advantage
I
have
reaped
from
this
climate
is
my
being
,
in
a
great
measure
,
delivered
from
a
slow
fever
which
used
to
hang
about
me
,
and
render
life
a
burthen
.
<EOS>
Neither
am
I
so
apt
to
catch
cold
as
I
used
to
be
in
England
and
France
;
and
the
colds
I
do
catch
are
not
of
the
same
continuance
and
consequence
,
as
those
to
which
I
was
formerly
subject
.
<EOS>
The
air
of
Nice
is
so
dry
,
that
in
summer
,
and
even
in
winter
,
(
except
ill
wet
weather
)
you
may
pass
the
evening
,
and
indeed
the
whole
night
,
sub
Dio
,
without
feeling
the
least
dew
or
moisture
;
and
as
for
fogs
,
they
are
never
seen
in
this
district
.
<EOS>
In
summer
,
the
air
is
cooled
by
a
regular
sea
-
breeze
blowing
from
the
cast
,
like
that
of
the
West
-
Indies
.
<EOS>
It
begins
in
the
forenoon
,
and
increases
with
the
heat
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
It
dies
away
about
six
or
seven
;
and
immediately
after
sun
-
set
is
succeeded
by
an
agreeable
land
-
breeze
from
the
mountains
.
<EOS>
The
sea
-
breeze
from
the
eastward
,
however
,
is
not
so
constant
here
,
as
in
the
West
-
Indies
between
the
tropicks
,
because
the
sun
,
which
produces
it
,
is
not
so
powerful
.
<EOS>
This
country
lies
nearer
the
region
of
variable
winds
,
and
is
surrounded
by
mountains
,
capes
,
and
straights
,
which
often
influence
the
constitution
and
current
of
the
air
.
<EOS>
About
the
winter
solstice
,
the
people
of
Nice
expect
wind
and
rain
,
which
generally
lasts
,
with
intervals
,
 
'
till
the
beginning
of
February
:
but
even
during
this
,
their
worst
weather
,
the
sun
breaks
out
occasionally
,
and
you
may
take
the
air
either
a
-
foot
or
on
horseback
every
day
;
for
the
moisture
is
immediately
absorbed
by
the
earth
,
which
is
naturally
dry
.
<EOS>
They
likewise
lay
their
account
with
being
visited
by
showers
of
rain
and
gusts
of
wind
in
April
.
<EOS>
A
week
's
rain
in
the
middle
of
August
makes
them
happy
.
<EOS>
It
not
only
refreshes
the
parched
ground
,
and
plumps
up
the
grapes
and
other
fruit
,
but
it
cools
the
air
and
assuages
the
beets
,
which
then
begin
to
grow
very
troublesome
;
but
the
rainy
season
is
about
the
autumnal
equinox
,
or
rather
something
later
.
<EOS>
It
continues
about
twelve
days
or
a
fortnight
,
and
is
extremely
welcome
to
the
natives
of
this
country
.
<EOS>
This
rainy
season
is
often
delayed
 
'
till
the
latter
end
of
November
,
and
sometimes
 
'
till
the
month
of
December
;
in
which
case
,
the
rest
of
the
winter
is
generally
dry
.
<EOS>
The
heavy
rains
in
this
country
generally
come
with
a
south
-
west
wind
,
which
was
the
creberque
procellis
Africus
,
the
stormy
southwest
,
of
the
antients
.
<EOS>
It
is
here
called
Lebeche
,
a
corruption
of
Lybicus
:
it
generally
blows
high
for
a
day
or
two
,
and
rolls
the
Mediterranean
before
it
in
huge
waves
,
that
often
enter
the
town
of
Nice
.
<EOS>
It
likewise
drives
before
it
all
the
clouds
which
had
been
formed
above
the
surface
of
the
Mediterranean
.
<EOS>
These
being
expended
in
rain
,
fair
weather
naturally
ensues
.
<EOS>
For
this
reason
,
the
Nissards
observe
le
lebeche
racommode
le
tems
,
the
Lebeche
settles
the
weather
.
<EOS>
During
the
rains
of
this
season
,
however
,
the
winds
have
been
variable
.
<EOS>
From
the
sixteenth
of
November
,
 
'
till
the
fourth
of
January
,
we
have
had
two
and
twenty
days
of
heavy
rain
:
a
very
extraordinary
visitation
in
this
country
:
but
the
seasons
seem
to
be
more
irregular
than
formerly
,
all
over
Europe
.
<EOS>
In
the
month
of
July
,
the
mercury
in
Fahrenheit
's
thermometer
,
rose
to
eighty
-
four
at
Rome
,
the
highest
degree
at
which
it
was
ever
known
in
that
country
;
and
the
very
next
day
,
the
Sabine
mountains
were
covered
with
snow
.
<EOS>
The
same
phaemomenon
happened
on
the
eleventh
of
August
,
and
the
thirtieth
of
September
.
<EOS>
The
consequence
of
these
sudden
variations
of
weather
,
was
this
:
putrid
fevers
were
less
frequent
than
usual
;
but
the
sudden
cheek
of
perspiration
from
the
cold
,
produced
colds
,
inflammatory
sore
throats
,
and
the
rheumatism
.
<EOS>
I
know
instances
of
some
English
valetudinarians
,
who
have
passed
the
winter
at
Aix
,
on
the
supposition
that
there
was
little
or
no
difference
between
that
air
and
the
climate
of
Nice
:
<EOS>
but
this
is
a
very
great
mistake
,
which
may
be
attended
with
fatal
consequences
.
<EOS>
Aix
is
altogether
exposed
to
the
north
and
north
-
west
winds
,
which
blow
as
cold
in
Provence
,
as
ever
I
felt
them
on
the
mountains
of
Scotland
:
whereas
Nice
is
entirely
screened
from
these
winds
by
the
Maritime
Alps
,
which
form
an
amphitheatre
,
to
the
land
-
side
,
around
this
little
territory
:
but
another
incontestible
proof
of
the
mildness
of
this
climate
,
is
deduced
from
the
oranges
,
lemons
,
citrons
,
roses
,
narcissus
's
,
july
-
flowers
,
and
jonquils
,
which
ripen
and
blow
in
the
middle
of
winter
.
<EOS>
I
have
described
the
agreeable
side
of
this
climate
;
and
now
I
will
point
out
its
inconveniences
.
<EOS>
In
the
winter
,
but
especially
in
the
spring
,
the
sun
is
so
hot
,
that
one
can
hardly
take
exercise
of
any
sort
abroad
,
without
being
thrown
into
a
breathing
sweat
;
and
the
wind
at
this
season
is
so
cold
and
piercing
,
that
it
often
produces
a
mischievous
effect
on
the
pores
thus
opened
.
<EOS>
If
the
heat
rarifies
the
blood
and
juices
,
while
the
cold
air
constringes
the
fibres
,
and
obstructs
the
perspiration
,
inflammatory
disorders
must
ensue
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
the
people
are
then
subject
to
colds
,
pleurisies
,
peripneumonies
,
and
ardent
fevers
.
<EOS>
An
old
count
advised
me
to
stay
within
doors
in
March
,
car
alors
les
humeurs
commencent
a
se
remuer
,
for
then
the
humours
begin
to
be
in
motion
.
<EOS>
During
the
heats
of
summer
,
some
few
persons
of
gross
habits
have
,
in
consequence
of
violent
exercise
and
excess
,
been
seized
with
putrid
fevers
,
attended
with
exanthemata
,
erisipelatous
,
and
miliary
eruptions
,
which
commonly
prove
fatal
:
but
the
people
in
general
are
healthy
,
even
those
that
take
very
little
exercise
:
a
strong
presumption
in
favour
of
the
climate
!
<EOS>
As
to
medicine
,
I
know
nothing
of
the
practice
of
the
Nice
physicians
.
<EOS>
Here
are
eleven
in
all
;
but
four
or
five
make
shift
to
live
by
the
profession
.
<EOS>
They
receive
,
by
way
of
fee
,
ten
sols
(
an
English
six
-
pence
)
<EOS>
a
visit
,
and
this
is
but
ill
paid
<EOS>
:
so
you
may
guess
whether
they
are
in
a
condition
to
support
the
dignity
of
physic
;
and
whether
any
man
,
of
a
liberal
education
,
would
bury
himself
at
Nice
on
such
terms
.
<EOS>
I
am
acquainted
with
an
Italian
physician
settled
at
Villa
Franca
,
a
very
good
sort
of
a
man
,
who
practises
for
a
certain
salary
,
raised
by
annual
contribution
among
the
better
sort
of
people
;
and
an
allowance
from
the
king
,
for
visiting
the
sick
belonging
to
the
garrison
and
the
gallies
.
<EOS>
The
whole
may
amount
to
near
thirty
pounds
.
  
<EOS>
Among
the
inconveniences
of
this
climate
,
the
vermin
form
no
inconsiderable
article
.
<EOS>
Vipers
and
snakes
are
found
in
the
mountains
.
<EOS>
Our
gardens
swarm
with
lizzards
;
and
there
are
some
few
scorpions
;
but
as
yet
I
have
seen
but
one
of
this
species
.
<EOS>
In
summer
,
notwithstanding
all
the
care
and
precautions
we
can
take
,
we
are
pestered
with
incredible
swarms
of
flies
,
fleas
,
and
bugs
;
but
the
gnats
,
or
couzins
,
are
more
intolerable
than
all
the
rest
.
<EOS>
In
the
day
-
time
,
it
is
impossible
to
keep
the
flies
out
of
your
mouth
,
nostrils
,
eyes
,
and
ears
.
<EOS>
They
croud
into
your
milk
,
tea
,
chocolate
,
soup
,
wine
,
and
water
:
they
soil
your
sugar
,
contaminate
your
victuals
,
and
devour
your
fruit
;
they
cover
and
defile
your
furniture
,
floors
,
cielings
,
and
indeed
your
whole
body
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
candles
are
lighted
,
the
couzins
begin
to
buz
about
your
ears
in
myriads
,
and
torment
you
with
their
stings
,
so
that
you
have
no
rest
nor
respite
 
'
till
you
get
into
bed
,
where
you
are
secured
by
your
mosquito
-
net
.
<EOS>
This
inclosure
is
very
disagreeable
in
hot
weather
;
and
very
inconvenient
to
those
,
who
,
like
me
,
are
subject
to
a
cough
and
spitting
.
<EOS>
It
is
moreover
ineffectual
;
for
some
of
those
cursed
insects
insinuate
themselves
within
it
,
almost
every
night
;
and
half
a
dozen
of
them
are
sufficient
to
disturb
you
 
'
till
morning
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
plague
that
continues
all
the
year
;
but
in
summer
it
is
intolerable
.
<EOS>
During
this
season
,
likewise
,
the
moths
are
so
mischievous
,
that
it
requires
the
utmost
care
to
preserve
woollen
cloths
from
being
destroyed
.
<EOS>
From
the
month
of
May
,
 
'
till
the
beginning
of
October
,
the
heat
is
so
violent
,
that
you
can
not
stir
abroad
after
six
in
the
morning
 
'
till
eight
at
night
,
so
that
you
are
entirely
deprived
of
the
benefit
of
exercise
:
<EOS>
There
is
no
shaded
walk
in
,
or
near
the
town
;
and
there
is
neither
coach
nor
chaise
to
hire
,
unless
you
travel
post
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
there
is
no
road
fit
for
any
wheel
carriage
,
but
the
common
highway
to
the
Var
,
in
which
you
are
scorched
by
the
reflexion
of
the
sun
from
the
sand
and
stones
,
and
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
half
stifled
with
dust
.
<EOS>
If
you
ride
out
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
,
you
will
have
the
disadvantage
of
returning
in
the
dark
.
  
<EOS>
Among
the
demerits
of
Nice
,
I
must
also
mention
the
water
which
is
used
in
the
city
.
<EOS>
It
is
drawn
from
wells
;
and
for
the
most
part
so
hard
,
that
it
curdles
with
soap
.
<EOS>
There
are
many
fountains
and
streams
in
the
neighbourhood
,
that
afford
excellent
water
,
which
,
at
no
great
charge
,
might
be
conveyed
into
the
town
,
so
as
to
form
conduits
in
all
the
public
streets
:
but
the
inhabitants
are
either
destitute
of
public
spirit
,
or
can
not
afford
the
expense
.
<EOS>
[
General
Paterson
delivered
a
Plan
to
the
King
of
Sardinia
for
supplying
Nice
with
excellent
water
for
so
small
an
expence
as
one
livre
a
house
per
annum
;
but
the
inhabitants
remonstrated
against
it
as
an
intolerable
Imposition
.
]
<EOS>
I
have
a
draw
-
well
in
my
porch
,
and
another
in
my
garden
,
which
supply
tolerable
water
for
culinary
uses
;
but
what
we
drink
,
is
fetched
from
a
well
belonging
to
a
convent
of
Dominicans
in
this
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
Our
linnen
is
washed
in
the
river
Paglion
;
and
when
that
is
dry
,
in
the
brook
called
Limpia
,
which
runs
into
the
harbour
.
  
<EOS>
In
mentioning
the
water
of
this
neighbourhood
,
I
ought
not
to
omit
the
baths
of
Rocabiliare
,
a
small
town
among
the
mountains
,
about
five
and
twenty
miles
from
Nice
.
<EOS>
There
are
three
sources
,
each
warmer
than
the
other
;
the
warmest
being
nearly
equal
to
the
heat
of
the
king
's
bath
at
Bath
in
Somersetshire
,
as
far
as
I
can
judge
from
information
.
<EOS>
I
have
perused
a
Latin
manuscript
,
which
treats
of
these
baths
at
Rocabiliare
,
written
by
the
duke
of
Savoy
's
first
physician
about
sixty
years
ago
.
<EOS>
He
talks
much
of
the
sulphur
and
the
nitre
which
they
contain
;
but
I
apprehend
their
efficacy
is
owing
to
the
same
volatile
vitriolic
principle
,
which
characterises
the
waters
at
Bath
.
<EOS>
They
are
attenuating
and
deobstruent
,
consequently
of
service
in
disorders
arising
from
a
languid
circulation
,
a
viscidity
of
the
juices
,
a
lax
fibre
,
and
obstructed
viscera
.
<EOS>
The
road
from
hence
to
Rocabiliare
is
in
some
parts
very
dangerous
,
lying
along
the
brink
of
precipices
,
impassable
to
any
other
carriage
but
a
mule
.
<EOS>
The
town
itself
affords
bad
lodging
and
accommodation
,
and
little
or
no
society
.
<EOS>
The
waters
are
at
the
distance
of
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
town
:
there
are
no
baths
nor
shelter
,
nor
any
sort
of
convenience
for
those
that
drink
them
;
and
the
best
part
of
their
efficacy
is
lost
,
unless
they
are
drank
at
the
fountain
-
head
.
<EOS>
If
these
objections
were
in
some
measure
removed
,
I
would
advise
valetudinarians
,
who
come
hither
for
the
benefit
of
this
climate
,
to
pass
the
heats
of
summer
at
Rocabiliare
,
which
being
situated
among
mountains
,
enjoys
a
cool
temperate
air
all
the
summer
.
<EOS>
This
would
be
a
salutary
respite
from
the
salt
air
of
Nice
,
to
those
who
labour
under
scorbutical
complaints
;
and
they
would
return
with
fresh
vigour
and
spirits
,
to
pass
the
winter
in
this
place
,
where
no
severity
of
weather
is
known
.
<EOS>
Last
June
,
when
I
found
myself
so
ill
at
my
cassine
,
I
had
determined
to
go
to
Rocabiliare
,
and
even
to
erect
a
hut
at
the
spring
,
for
my
own
convenience
.
<EOS>
A
gentleman
of
Nice
undertook
to
procure
me
a
tolerable
lodging
in
the
house
of
the
cure
,
who
was
his
relation
.
<EOS>
He
assured
me
<EOS>
,
there
was
no
want
of
fresh
butter
,
good
poultry
,
excellent
veal
,
and
delicate
trout
;
and
that
the
articles
of
living
might
be
had
at
Rocabiliare
for
half
the
price
we
paid
at
Nice
:
but
finding
myself
grow
better
immediately
on
my
return
from
the
cassine
to
my
own
house
,
I
would
not
put
myself
to
the
trouble
and
expence
of
a
further
removal
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
now
communicated
all
the
particulars
relating
to
Nice
,
that
are
worth
knowing
;
and
perhaps
many
more
than
you
desired
to
know
:
<EOS>
but
,
in
such
cases
,
I
would
rather
be
thought
prolix
and
unentertaining
,
than
deficient
in
that
regard
and
attention
with
which
I
am
very
sincerely
,
 
Your
friend
and
servant

NICE
,
January
1

1765
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
<EOS>
It
was
in
deference
to
your
opinion
,
reinforced
by
my
own
inclination
,
and
the
repeated
advice
of
other
friends
,
that
I
resolved
upon
my
late
excursion
to
Italy
.
<EOS>
I
could
plainly
perceive
from
the
anxious
solicitude
,
and
pressing
exhortations
contained
in
all
the
letters
I
had
lately
received
from
my
correspondents
in
Britain
,
that
you
had
all
despaired
of
my
recovery
.
<EOS>
You
advised
me
to
make
a
pilgrimage
among
the
Alps
,
and
the
advice
was
good
.
<EOS>
In
scrambling
among
those
mountains
,
I
should
have
benefited
by
the
exercise
,
and
at
the
same
time
have
breathed
a
cool
,
pure
,
salubrious
air
,
which
,
in
all
probability
,
would
have
expelled
the
slow
fever
arising
in
a
great
measure
from
the
heat
of
this
climate
.
<EOS>
But
,
I
wanted
a
companion
and
fellow
traveller
,
whose
conversation
and
society
could
alleviate
the
horrors
of
solitude
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
was
not
strong
enough
to
encounter
the
want
of
conveniences
,
and
even
of
necessaries
to
which
I
must
have
been
exposed
in
the
course
of
such
an
expedition
.
<EOS>
My
worthy
friend
Dr
A
  
earnestly
intreated
me
to
try
the
effect
of
a
sea
-
voyage
,
which
you
know
has
been
found
of
wonderful
efficacy
in
consumptive
cases
.
<EOS>
After
some
deliberation
,
I
resolved
upon
the
scheme
,
which
I
have
now
happily
executed
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
most
eager
curiosity
to
see
the
antiquities
of
Florence
and
Rome
:
I
longed
impatiently
to
view
those
wonderful
edifices
,
statues
,
and
pictures
,
which
I
had
so
often
admired
in
prints
and
descriptions
.
<EOS>
I
felt
an
enthusiastic
ardor
to
tread
that
very
classical
ground
which
had
been
the
scene
of
so
many
great
atchievements
;
and
I
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
returning
to
England
from
the
very
skirts
of
Italy
,
without
having
penetrated
to
the
capital
of
that
renowned
country
.
<EOS>
With
regard
to
my
health
,
I
knew
I
could
manage
matters
so
as
to
enjoy
all
the
benefits
that
could
be
expected
from
the
united
energy
of
a
voyage
by
sea
,
a
journey
by
land
,
and
a
change
of
climate
.
  
<EOS>
Rome
is
betwixt
four
and
five
hundred
miles
distant
from
Nice
,
and
one
half
of
the
way
I
was
resolved
to
travel
by
water
.
<EOS>
Indeed
there
is
no
other
way
of
going
from
hence
to
Genoa
,
unless
you
take
a
mule
,
and
clamber
along
the
mountains
at
the
rate
of
two
miles
an
hour
,
and
at
the
risque
of
breaking
your
neck
every
minute
.
<EOS>
The
Apennine
mountains
,
which
are
no
other
than
a
continuation
of
the
maritime
Alps
,
form
an
almost
continued
precipice
from
Villefranche
to
Lerici
,
which
is
almost
forty
-
five
miles
on
the
other
side
of
Genoa
;
and
as
they
are
generally
washed
by
the
sea
,
there
is
no
beach
or
shore
,
<EOS>
consequently
the
road
is
carried
along
the
face
of
the
rocks
,
except
at
certain
small
intervals
,
which
are
occupied
by
towns
and
villages
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
there
is
a
road
for
mules
and
foot
passengers
,
it
might
certainly
be
enlarged
and
improved
so
as
to
render
it
practicable
by
chaises
and
other
wheel
-
carriages
,
and
a
toll
might
be
exacted
,
which
in
a
little
time
would
defray
the
expence
:
for
certainly
no
person
who
travels
to
Italy
,
from
England
,
Holland
,
France
,
or
Spain
,
would
make
a
troublesome
circuit
to
pass
the
Alps
by
the
way
of
Savoy
and
Piedmont
,
if
he
could
have
the
convenience
of
going
post
by
the
way
of
Aix
,
Antibes
,
and
Nice
,
along
the
side
of
the
Mediterranean
,
and
through
the
Riviera
of
Genoa
,
which
from
the
sea
affords
the
most
agreeable
and
amazing
prospect
I
ever
beheld
.
<EOS>
What
pity
it
is
,
they
can
not
restore
the
celebrated
Via
Aurelia
,
mentioned
in
the
Itinerarium
of
Antoninus
,
which
extended
from
Rome
by
the
way
of
Genoa
,
and
through
this
country
as
far
as
Arles
upon
the
Rhone
.
<EOS>
It
was
said
to
have
been
made
by
the
emperor
Marcus
Aurelius
;
and
some
of
the
vestiges
of
it
are
still
to
be
seen
in
Provence
.
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
the
nobility
of
Genoa
,
who
are
all
merchants
,
from
a
low
,
selfish
,
and
absurd
policy
,
take
all
methods
to
keep
their
subjects
of
the
Riviera
in
poverty
and
dependence
.
<EOS>
With
this
view
,
they
carefully
avoid
all
steps
towards
rendering
that
country
accessible
by
land
;
and
at
the
same
time
discourage
their
trade
by
sea
,
lest
it
should
interfere
with
the
commerce
of
their
capital
,
in
which
they
themselves
are
personally
concerned
.
  
<EOS>
Those
who
either
will
not
or
can
not
bear
the
sea
,
and
are
equally
averse
to
riding
,
may
be
carried
in
a
common
chair
,
provided
with
a
foot
-
board
,
on
men
's
shoulders
:
this
is
the
way
of
travelling
practised
by
the
ladies
of
Nice
,
in
crossing
the
mountains
to
Turin
;
but
it
is
very
tedious
and
expensive
,
as
the
men
must
be
often
relieved
.
  
<EOS>
The
most
agreeable
carriage
from
here
to
Genoa
,
is
a
feluca
,
or
open
boat
,
rowed
by
ten
or
twelve
stout
mariners
.
<EOS>
Though
none
of
these
boats
belong
to
Nice
,
they
are
to
be
found
every
day
in
our
harbour
,
waiting
for
a
fare
to
Genoa
;
and
they
are
seen
passing
and
repassing
continually
,
with
merchandize
or
passengers
,
between
Marseilles
,
Antibes
,
and
the
Genoese
territories
.
<EOS>
A
feluca
is
large
enough
to
take
in
a
post
-
chaise
;
and
there
is
a
tilt
over
the
stern
sheets
,
where
the
passengers
sit
,
to
protect
them
from
the
rain
:
between
the
seats
one
person
may
lie
commodiously
upon
a
mattress
,
which
is
commonly
supplied
by
the
patron
.
<EOS>
A
man
in
good
health
may
put
up
with
any
thing
;
but
I
would
advise
every
valetudinarian
who
travels
this
way
,
to
provide
his
own
chaise
,
mattrass
,
and
bedlinnen
,
otherwise
he
will
pass
his
time
very
uncomfortably
.
<EOS>
If
you
go
as
a
simple
passenger
in
a
feluca
,
you
pay
about
a
loui'dore
for
your
place
,
and
you
must
be
intirely
under
the
direction
of
the
patron
,
who
,
while
he
can
bear
the
sea
,
will
prosecute
his
voyage
by
night
as
well
as
by
day
,
and
expose
you
to
many
other
inconveniencies
:
but
for
eight
zequines
,
or
four
loui'dores
,
you
can
have
a
whole
feluca
to
yourself
,
from
Nice
to
Genoa
,
and
the
master
shall
be
obliged
to
put
a
-
shore
every
evening
.
<EOS>
If
you
would
have
it
still
more
at
your
command
,
you
may
hire
it
at
so
much
per
day
,
and
in
that
case
,
go
on
shore
as
often
,
and
stay
as
long
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
This
is
the
method
I
should
take
,
were
I
to
make
the
voyage
again
;
for
I
am
persuaded
<EOS>
I
should
find
it
very
near
as
cheap
,
and
much
more
agreeable
than
any
other
.
  
<EOS>
The
distance
between
this
place
and
Genoa
,
when
measured
on
the
carte
,
does
not
exceed
ninety
miles
:
but
the
people
of
the
felucas
insist
upon
its
being
one
hundred
and
twenty
.
<EOS>
If
they
creep
along
shore
round
the
bottoms
of
all
the
bays
,
this
computation
may
be
true
:
but
,
except
when
the
sea
is
rough
,
they
stretch
directly
from
one
head
-
land
to
another
,
and
even
when
the
wind
is
contrary
,
provided
the
gale
is
not
fresh
,
they
perform
the
voyage
in
two
days
and
a
half
,
by
dint
of
rowing
:
when
the
wind
is
favourable
,
they
will
sail
it
easily
in
fourteen
hours
.
  
<EOS>
A
man
who
has
nothing
but
expedition
in
view
,
may
go
with
the
courier
,
who
has
always
a
light
boat
well
manned
,
and
will
be
glad
to
accommodate
a
traveller
for
a
reasonable
gratification
.
<EOS>
I
know
an
English
gentleman
who
always
travels
with
the
courier
in
Italy
,
both
by
sea
and
land
.
<EOS>
In
posting
by
land
,
he
is
always
sure
of
having
part
of
a
good
calash
,
and
the
best
horses
that
can
be
found
;
and
as
the
expence
of
both
is
defrayed
by
the
public
,
it
costs
him
nothing
but
a
present
to
his
companion
,
which
does
not
amount
to
one
fourth
part
of
the
expence
he
would
incur
by
travelling
alone
.
<EOS>
These
opportunities
may
be
had
every
week
in
all
the
towns
of
Italy
.
  
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
hired
a
gondola
from
hence
to
Genoa
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
boat
smaller
than
a
feluca
,
rowed
by
four
men
,
and
steered
by
the
patron
;
but
the
price
was
nine
zequines
,
rather
more
than
I
should
have
payed
for
a
feluca
of
ten
oars
.
<EOS>
I
was
assured
that
being
very
light
,
it
would
make
great
way
;
and
the
master
was
particularly
recommended
to
me
,
as
an
honest
man
and
an
able
mariner
.
<EOS>
I
was
accompanied
in
this
voyage
by
my
wife
and
Miss
C
 
,
together
with
one
<EOS>
Mr
R
 
,
a
native
of
Nice
,
whom
I
treated
with
the
jaunt
,
in
hopes
that
as
he
was
acquainted
with
the
customs
of
the
country
,
and
the
different
ways
of
travelling
in
it
,
he
would
save
us
much
trouble
,
and
some
expence
:
<EOS>
but
I
was
much
disappointed
.
<EOS>
Some
persons
at
Nice
offered
to
lay
wagers
that
he
would
return
by
himself
from
Italy
;
but
they
were
also
disappointed
.
  
<EOS>
We
embarked
in
the
beginning
of
September
,
attended
by
one
servant
.
<EOS>
The
heats
,
which
render
travelling
dangerous
in
Italy
,
begin
to
abate
at
this
season
.
<EOS>
The
weather
was
extremely
agreeable
;
and
if
I
had
postponed
my
voyage
a
little
longer
,
I
foresaw
that
I
should
not
be
able
to
return
before
winter
:
in
which
case
I
might
have
found
the
sea
too
rough
,
and
the
weather
too
cold
for
a
voyage
of
one
hundred
and
thirty
-
five
miles
in
an
open
boat
.
  
<EOS>
Having
therefore
provided
myself
with
a
proper
pass
,
signed
and
sealed
by
our
consul
,
as
well
as
with
letters
of
recommendation
from
him
to
the
English
consuls
at
Genoa
and
Leghorn
,
a
precaution
which
I
would
advise
all
travellers
to
take
,
in
case
of
meeting
with
accidents
on
the
road
,
we
went
on
board
about
ten
in
the
morning
,
stopped
about
half
an
hour
at
a
friend
's
country
-
house
in
the
bay
of
St
Hospice
,
and
about
noon
entered
the
harbour
of
Monaco
,
where
the
patron
was
obliged
to
pay
toll
,
according
to
the
regulation
which
I
have
explained
in
a
former
letter
.
<EOS>
This
small
town
,
containing
about
eight
or
nine
hundred
souls
,
besides
the
garrison
,
is
built
on
a
rock
which
projects
into
the
sea
,
and
makes
a
very
romantic
appearance
.
<EOS>
The
prince
's
palace
stands
in
the
most
conspicuous
part
,
with
a
walk
of
trees
before
it
.
<EOS>
The
apartments
are
elegantly
furnished
,
and
adorned
with
some
good
pictures
.
<EOS>
The
fortifications
are
in
good
repair
,
and
the
place
is
garrisoned
by
two
French
battalions
.
<EOS>
The
present
prince
of
Monaco
is
a
Frenchman
,
son
of
the
duke
Matignon
who
married
the
heiress
of
Monaco
,
whose
name
was
Grimaldi
.
<EOS>
The
harbour
is
well
sheltered
from
the
wind
;
but
has
not
water
sufficient
to
admit
vessels
of
any
great
burthen
.
<EOS>
Towards
the
north
,
the
king
of
Sardinia
's
territories
extend
to
within
a
mile
of
the
gate
;
but
the
prince
of
Monaco
can
go
upon
his
own
ground
along
shore
about
five
or
six
miles
to
the
eastward
,
as
far
as
Menton
,
another
small
town
,
which
also
belongs
to
him
,
and
is
situated
on
the
seaside
.
<EOS>
His
revenues
are
computed
at
a
million
of
French
livres
,
amounting
to
something
more
than
forty
thousand
pounds
sterling
:
but
,
the
principality
of
Monaco
,
consisting
of
three
small
towns
,
and
an
inconsiderable
tract
of
barren
rock
,
is
not
worth
above
seven
thousand
a
year
;
the
rest
arises
from
his
French
estate
.
<EOS>
This
consists
partly
of
the
dutchy
of
Matignon
,
and
partly
of
the
dutchy
of
Valentinois
,
which
last
was
given
to
the
ancestors
of
this
prince
of
Monaco
,
in
the
year
1640
,
by
the
French
king
,
to
make
up
the
loss
of
some
lands
in
the
kingdom
of
Naples
,
which
were
confiscated
when
he
expelled
the
Spanish
garrison
from
Monaco
,
and
threw
himself
into
the
arms
of
France
:
so
that
he
is
duke
of
Valentinois
as
well
as
of
Matignon
,
in
that
kingdom
.
<EOS>
He
lives
almost
constantly
in
France
;
and
has
taken
the
name
and
arms
of
Grimaldi
.
  
<EOS>
The
Genoese
territories
begin
at
Ventimiglia
,
another
town
lying
on
the
coast
,
at
the
distance
of
twenty
miles
from
Nice
,
a
circumstance
from
which
it
borrows
the
name
.
<EOS>
Having
passed
the
towns
of
Monaco
,
Menton
,
Ventimiglia
,
and
several
other
places
of
less
consequence
that
lie
along
this
coast
,
we
turned
the
point
of
St
Martin
with
a
favourable
breeze
,
and
might
have
proceeded
twenty
miles
further
before
night
:
but
the
women
began
to
be
sick
,
as
well
as
afraid
at
the
roughness
of
the
water
;
<EOS>
Mr
R
  
was
so
discomposed
,
that
he
privately
desired
the
patron
to
put
ashore
at
St
Remo
,
on
pretence
that
we
should
not
find
a
tolerable
auberge
in
any
other
place
between
this
and
Noli
,
which
was
at
the
distance
of
forty
miles
.
<EOS>
We
accordingly
landed
,
and
were
conducted
to
the
poste
,
which
our
gondeliere
assured
us
was
the
best
auberge
in
the
whole
Riviera
of
Genoa
.
<EOS>
We
ascended
by
a
dark
,
narrow
,
steep
stair
,
into
a
kind
of
public
room
,
with
a
long
table
and
benches
,
so
dirty
and
miserable
,
that
it
would
disgrace
the
worst
hedge
ale
-
house
in
England
.
<EOS>
Not
a
soul
appeared
to
receive
us
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
ceremony
one
must
not
expect
to
meet
with
in
France
;
far
less
in
Italy
.
<EOS>
Our
patron
going
into
the
kitchen
,
asked
a
servant
if
the
company
could
have
lodging
in
the
house
;
and
was
answered
,
"
he
could
not
tell
:
the
patron
was
not
at
home
.
"
<EOS>
When
he
desired
to
know
where
the
patron
was
,
the
other
answered
,
"
he
was
gone
to
take
the
air
.
"
<EOS>
E
andato
a
passeggiare
.
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
we
were
obliged
to
sit
in
the
common
room
among
watermen
and
muleteers
.
<EOS>
At
length
the
landlord
arrived
,
and
gave
us
to
understand
,
that
he
could
accommodate
us
with
chambers
.
<EOS>
In
that
where
I
lay
,
there
was
just
room
for
two
beds
,
without
curtains
or
bedstead
,
an
old
rotten
table
covered
with
dried
figs
,
and
a
couple
of
crazy
chairs
.
<EOS>
The
walls
had
been
once
white
-
washed
:
but
were
now
hung
with
cobwebs
,
and
speckled
with
dirt
of
all
sorts
;
and
I
believe
the
brick
-
floor
had
not
been
swept
for
half
a
century
.
<EOS>
We
supped
in
an
outward
room
suitable
in
all
respects
to
the
chamber
,
and
fared
villainously
.
<EOS>
The
provision
was
very
ill
-
dressed
,
and
served
up
in
the
most
slovenly
manner
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
expect
cleanliness
or
conveniency
of
any
kind
in
this
country
.
<EOS>
For
this
accommodation
I
payed
as
much
as
if
I
had
been
elegantly
entertained
in
the
best
auberge
of
France
or
Italy
.
  
<EOS>
Next
day
,
the
wind
was
so
high
that
we
could
not
prosecute
our
voyage
,
so
that
we
were
obliged
to
pass
other
four
and
twenty
hours
in
this
comfortable
situation
.
<EOS>
Luckily
Mr
R
  
found
two
acquaintances
in
the
place
;
one
a
Franciscan
monk
,
a
jolly
fellow
;
and
the
other
a
maestro
di
capella
,
who
sent
a
spinnet
to
the
inn
,
and
entertained
us
agreeably
with
his
voice
and
performance
,
in
both
of
which
accomplishments
he
excelled
.
<EOS>
The
padre
was
very
good
humoured
,
and
favoured
us
with
a
letter
of
recommendation
to
a
friend
of
his
,
a
professor
in
the
university
of
Pisa
.
<EOS>
You
would
laugh
to
see
the
hyperbolical
terms
in
which
he
mentioned
your
humble
servant
;
but
Italy
is
the
native
country
of
hyperbole
.
  
<EOS>
St
Remo
is
a
pretty
considerable
town
,
well
-
built
upon
the
declivity
of
a
gently
rising
hill
,
and
has
a
harbour
capable
of
receiving
small
vessels
,
a
good
number
of
which
are
built
upon
the
beach
:
but
ships
of
any
burden
are
obliged
to
anchor
in
the
bay
,
which
is
far
from
being
secure
.
<EOS>
The
people
of
St
Remo
form
a
small
republic
,
which
is
subject
to
Genoa
.
  
<EOS>
They
enjoyed
particular
privileges
,
till
the
year
1753
,
when
in
consequence
of
a
new
gabelle
upon
salt
,
they
revolted
:
but
this
effort
in
behalf
of
liberty
did
not
succeed
.
<EOS>
They
were
soon
reduced
by
the
Genoese
,
who
deprived
them
of
all
their
privileges
,
and
built
a
fort
by
the
sea
-
side
,
which
serves
the
double
purpose
of
defending
the
harbour
and
over
-
awing
the
town
.
<EOS>
The
garrison
at
present
does
not
exceed
two
hundred
men
.
<EOS>
The
inhabitants
are
said
to
have
lately
sent
a
deputation
to
Ratisbon
,
to
crave
the
protection
of
the
diet
of
the
empire
.
<EOS>
There
is
very
little
plain
ground
in
this
neighbourhood
;
but
the
hills
are
covered
with
oranges
,
lemons
,
pomegranates
,
and
olives
,
which
produce
a
considerable
traffic
in
fine
fruit
and
excellent
oil
.
<EOS>
The
women
of
St
Remo
are
much
more
handsome
and
better
tempered
than
those
of
Provence
.
<EOS>
They
have
in
general
good
eyes
,
with
open
ingenuous
countenances
.
<EOS>
Their
dress
,
though
remarkable
,
I
can
not
describe
:
but
upon
the
whole
,
they
put
me
in
mind
of
some
portraits
I
have
seen
,
representing
the
females
of
Georgia
and
Mingrelia
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
third
day
,
the
wind
being
abated
,
though
still
unfavourable
,
we
reimbarked
and
rowed
along
shore
,
passing
by
Porto
-
mauricio
,
and
Oneglia
;
then
turning
the
promontory
called
Capo
di
Melle
,
we
proceeded
by
Albenga
,
Finale
,
and
many
other
places
of
inferior
note
.
<EOS>
Portomauricio
is
seated
on
a
rock
washed
by
the
sea
,
but
indifferently
fortified
,
with
an
inconsiderable
harbour
,
which
none
but
very
small
vessels
can
enter
.
<EOS>
About
two
miles
to
the
eastward
is
Oneglia
,
a
small
town
with
fortifications
,
lying
along
the
open
beach
,
and
belonging
to
the
king
of
Sardinia
.
<EOS>
This
small
territory
abounds
with
olive
-
trees
,
which
produce
a
considerable
quantity
of
oil
,
counted
the
best
of
the
whole
Riviera
.
<EOS>
Albenga
is
a
small
town
,
the
see
of
a
bishop
,
suffragan
to
the
archbishop
of
Genoa
.
<EOS>
It
lies
upon
the
sea
,
and
the
country
produces
a
great
quantity
of
hemp
.
<EOS>
Finale
is
the
capital
of
a
marquisate
belonging
to
the
Genoese
,
which
has
been
the
source
of
much
trouble
to
the
republic
;
and
indeed
was
the
sole
cause
of
their
rupture
with
the
king
of
Sardinia
and
the
house
of
Austria
in
the
year
1745
.
<EOS>
The
town
is
pretty
well
built
;
but
the
harbour
is
shallow
,
open
,
and
unsafe
;
nevertheless
,
they
built
a
good
number
of
tartans
and
other
vessels
on
the
beach
and
the
neighbouring
country
abounds
with
oil
and
fruit
,
particularly
with
those
excellent
apples
called
pomi
carli
,
which
I
have
mentioned
in
a
former
letter
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
evening
we
reached
the
Capo
di
Noli
,
counted
very
dangerous
in
blowing
weather
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
very
high
perpendicular
rock
or
mountain
washed
by
the
sea
,
which
has
eaten
into
it
in
divers
places
,
so
as
to
form
a
great
number
of
caverns
.
<EOS>
It
extends
about
a
couple
of
miles
,
and
in
some
parts
is
indented
into
little
creeks
or
bays
,
where
there
is
a
narrow
margin
of
sandy
beach
between
it
and
the
water
.
<EOS>
When
the
wind
is
high
,
no
feluca
will
attempt
to
pass
it
;
even
in
a
moderate
breeze
,
the
waves
dashing
against
the
rocks
and
caverns
,
which
echo
with
the
sound
,
make
such
an
awful
noise
,
and
at
the
same
time
occasion
such
a
rough
sea
,
as
one
can
not
hear
,
and
see
,
and
feel
,
without
a
secret
horror
.
  
<EOS>
On
this
side
of
the
Cape
,
there
is
a
beautiful
strand
cultivated
like
a
garden
;
the
plantations
extend
to
the
very
tops
of
the
hills
,
interspersed
with
villages
,
castles
,
churches
,
and
villas
.
<EOS>
Indeed
the
whole
Riviera
is
ornamented
in
the
same
manner
,
except
in
such
places
as
admit
of
no
building
nor
 
cultivation
.
  
<EOS>
Having
passed
the
Cape
,
we
followed
the
winding
of
the
coast
,
into
a
small
bay
,
and
arrived
at
the
town
of
Noli
,
where
we
proposed
to
pass
the
night
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
surprised
that
we
did
not
go
ashore
sooner
,
in
order
to
take
some
refreshment
;
but
the
truth
is
,
we
had
a
provision
of
ham
,
tongues
,
roasted
pullets
,
cheese
,
bread
,
wine
,
and
fruit
,
in
the
feluca
,
where
we
every
day
enjoyed
a
slight
repast
about
one
or
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
This
I
mention
as
a
necessary
piece
of
information
to
those
who
may
be
inclined
to
follow
the
same
route
.
<EOS>
We
likewise
found
it
convenient
to
lay
in
store
of
l'eau
de
vie
,
or
brandy
,
for
the
use
of
the
rowers
,
who
always
expect
to
share
your
comforts
.
 
<EOS>
On
a
meagre
day
,
however
,
those
ragamuffins
will
rather
die
of
hunger
than
suffer
the
least
morsel
of
flesh
-
meat
to
enter
their
mouths
.
<EOS>
I
have
frequently
tried
the
experiment
,
by
pressing
them
to
eat
something
gras
,
on
a
Friday
or
Saturday
:
but
they
always
declined
it
with
marks
of
abhorrence
,
crying
,
Dio
me
<EOS>
ne
libere
!
<EOS>
God
deliver
me
from
it
!
<EOS>
or
some
other
words
to
that
effect
.
<EOS>
I
moreover
observed
,
that
not
one
of
those
fellows
ever
swore
an
oath
,
or
spoke
an
indecent
word
.
<EOS>
They
would
by
no
means
put
to
sea
,
of
a
morning
,
before
they
had
heard
mass
;
and
when
the
wind
was
unfavourable
,
they
always
set
out
with
a
hymn
to
the
Blessed
Virgin
,
or
St
Elmo
,
keeping
time
with
their
oars
as
they
sung
.
<EOS>
I
have
indeed
remarked
all
over
this
country
,
that
a
man
who
transgresses
the
institutions
of
the
church
in
these
small
matters
,
is
much
more
infamous
than
one
who
has
committed
the
most
flagrant
crimes
against
nature
and
morality
.
<EOS>
A
murderer
,
adulterer
,
or
s
 
m
 
te
,
will
obtain
easy
absolution
from
the
church
,
and
even
find
favour
with
society
;
but
a
man
who
eats
a
pidgeon
on
a
Saturday
,
without
express
licence
,
is
avoided
and
abhorred
,
as
a
monster
of
reprobation
.
<EOS>
I
have
conversed
with
several
intelligent
persons
on
the
subject
;
and
have
reason
to
believe
,
that
a
delinquent
of
this
sort
is
considered
as
a
luke
-
warm
catholic
,
little
better
than
a
heretic
;
and
of
all
crimes
they
look
upon
heresy
as
the
most
damnable
.
  
<EOS>
Noli
is
a
small
republic
of
fishermen
subject
to
Genoa
;
but
very
tenacious
of
their
privileges
.
<EOS>
The
town
stands
on
the
beach
,
tolerably
well
built
,
defended
by
a
castle
situated
on
a
rock
above
it
;
and
the
harbour
is
of
little
consequence
.
<EOS>
The
auberge
was
such
as
made
us
regret
even
the
inn
we
had
left
at
St
Remo
.
<EOS>
After
a
very
odd
kind
of
supper
,
which
I
can
not
pretend
to
describe
,
we
retired
to
our
repose
:
<EOS>
but
I
had
not
been
in
bed
five
minutes
,
when
I
felt
something
crawling
on
different
parts
of
my
body
,
and
taking
a
light
to
examine
,
perceived
above
a
dozen
large
bugs
.
<EOS>
You
must
know
I
have
the
same
kind
of
antipathy
to
these
vermin
,
that
some
persons
have
to
a
cat
or
breast
of
veal
.
<EOS>
I
started
up
immediately
,
and
wrapping
myself
in
a
great
coat
,
sick
as
I
was
,
laid
down
in
the
outer
room
upon
a
chest
,
where
I
continued
till
morning
.
  
<EOS>
One
would
imagine
that
in
a
mountainous
country
like
this
,
there
should
be
plenty
of
goats
;
and
indeed
,
we
saw
many
flocks
of
them
feeding
among
the
rocks
,
yet
we
could
not
procure
half
a
pint
of
milk
for
our
tea
,
if
we
had
given
the
weight
of
it
in
gold
.
<EOS>
The
people
here
have
no
idea
of
using
milk
,
and
when
you
ask
them
for
it
,
they
stand
gaping
with
a
foolish
face
of
surprise
,
which
is
exceedingly
provoking
.
<EOS>
It
is
amazing
that
instinct
does
not
teach
the
peasants
to
feed
their
children
with
goat
's
milk
,
so
much
more
nourishing
and
agreeable
than
the
wretched
sustenance
on
which
they
live
.
<EOS>
Next
day
we
rowed
by
Vado
and
Savona
,
which
last
is
a
large
town
,
with
a
strong
citadel
,
and
a
harbour
,
which
was
formerly
capable
of
receiving
large
ships
:
but
it
fell
a
sacrifice
to
the
jealousy
of
the
Genoese
,
who
have
partly
choaked
it
up
,
on
pretence
that
it
should
not
afford
shelter
to
the
ships
of
war
belonging
to
those
states
which
might
be
at
enmity
with
the
republic
.
  
<EOS>
Then
we
passed
Albifola
,
Sestri
di
Ponente
,
Novi
,
Voltri
,
and
a
great
number
of
villages
,
villas
,
and
magnificent
palaces
belonging
to
the
Genoese
nobility
,
which
form
almost
a
continued
chain
of
buildings
along
the
strand
for
thirty
miles
.
  
<EOS>
About
five
in
the
afternoon
,
we
skirted
the
fine
suburbs
of
St
Pietro
d
'
Arena
,
and
arrived
at
Genoa
,
which
makes
a
dazzling
appearance
when
viewed
from
the
sea
,
rising
like
an
amphitheatre
in
a
circular
form
from
the
water
's
edge
,
a
considerable
way
up
the
mountains
,
and
surrounded
on
the
land
side
by
a
double
wall
,
the
most
exterior
of
which
is
said
to
extend
fifteen
miles
in
circuit
.
<EOS>
The
first
object
that
strikes
your
eye
at
a
distance
,
is
a
very
elegant
pharos
,
or
lighthouse
,
built
on
the
projection
of
a
rock
on
the
west
side
of
the
harbour
,
so
very
high
,
that
,
in
a
clear
day
,
you
may
see
it
at
the
distance
of
thirty
miles
.
<EOS>
Turning
the
light
-
house
point
,
you
find
yourself
close
to
the
mole
,
which
forms
the
harbour
of
Genoa
.
<EOS>
It
is
built
at
a
great
expence
from
each
side
of
the
bay
,
so
as
to
form
in
the
sea
two
long
magnificent
jettes
.
<EOS>
At
the
extremity
of
each
is
another
smaller
lanthorn
.
<EOS>
These
moles
are
both
provided
with
brass
-
cannon
,
and
between
them
is
the
entrance
into
the
harbour
.
<EOS>
But
this
is
still
so
wide
as
to
admit
a
great
sea
,
which
,
when
the
wind
blows
hard
from
south
and
south
-
west
,
is
very
troublesome
to
the
shipping
.
<EOS>
Within
the
mole
there
is
a
smaller
harbour
or
wet
dock
,
called
Darsena
,
for
the
gallies
of
the
republic
.
<EOS>
We
passed
through
a
considerable
number
of
ships
and
vessels
lying
at
anchor
,
and
landing
at
the
water
-
gate
,
repaired
to
an
inn
called
La
Croix
de
Malthe
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
harbour
.
<EOS>
Here
we
met
with
such
good
entertainment
as
prepossessed
us
in
favour
of
the
interior
parts
of
Italy
,
and
contributed
with
other
motives
to
detain
us
some
days
in
this
city
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
detained
you
so
long
,
that
I
believe
you
wish
I
may
proceed
no
farther
;
and
therefore
I
take
my
leave
for
the
present
,
being
very
sincerely
  
Yours
.

NICE

<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
without
reason
that
Genoa
is
called
La
superba
.
<EOS>
The
city
itself
is
very
stately
;
and
the
nobles
are
very
proud
.
<EOS>
Some
few
of
them
may
be
proud
of
their
wealth
:
but
,
in
general
,
their
fortunes
are
very
small
.
<EOS>
My
friend
Mr
R
  
assured
me
that
many
Genoese
noblemen
had
fortunes
of
half
a
million
of
livres
per
annum
:
but
the
truth
is
,
the
whole
revenue
of
the
state
does
not
exceed
this
sum
;
and
the
livre
of
Genoa
is
but
about
nine
pence
sterling
.
<EOS>
There
are
about
half
a
dozen
of
their
nobles
who
have
ten
thousand
a
year
:
but
the
majority
have
not
above
a
twentieth
part
of
that
sum
.
<EOS>
They
live
with
great
parsimony
in
their
families
;
and
wear
nothing
but
black
in
public
;
so
that
their
expences
are
but
small
.
<EOS>
If
a
Genoese
nobleman
gives
an
entertainment
once
a
quarter
,
he
is
said
to
live
upon
the
fragments
all
the
rest
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
I
was
told
that
one
of
them
lately
treated
his
friends
,
and
left
the
entertainment
to
the
care
of
his
son
,
who
ordered
a
dish
of
fish
that
cost
a
zechine
,
which
is
equal
to
about
ten
shillings
sterling
.
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
no
sooner
saw
it
appear
on
the
table
,
than
unable
to
suppress
his
concern
,
he
burst
into
tears
,
and
exclaimed
,
Ah
Figliuolo
indegno
!
<EOS>
Siamo
in
Rovina
!
<EOS>
Siamo
in
precipizio
!
<EOS>
Ah
,
Prodigal

<EOS>
ruined
!
<EOS>
undone
!
  
<EOS>
I
think
the
pride
or
ostentation
of
the
Italians
in
general
takes
a
more
laudable
turn
than
that
of
other
nations
.
<EOS>
A
Frenchman
lays
out
his
whole
revenue
upon
tawdry
suits
of
cloaths
,
or
in
furnishing
a
magnificent
repas
of
fifty
or
a
hundred
dishes
,
one
half
of
which
are
not
eatable
nor
intended
to
be
eaten
.
<EOS>
His
wardrobe
goes
to
the
fripier
;
his
dishes
to
the
dogs
,
and
himself
to
the
devil
,
and
after
his
decease
no
vestige
of
him
remains
.
<EOS>
A
Genoese
,
on
the
other
hand
,
keeps
himself
and
his
family
at
short
allowance
,
that
he
may
save
money
to
build
palaces
and
churches
,
which
remain
to
after
-
ages
<EOS>
so
many
monuments
of
his
taste
,
piety
,
and
munificence
;
and
in
the
mean
time
give
employment
and
bread
to
the
poor
and
industrious
.
<EOS>
There
are
some
Genoese
nobles
who
have
each
five
or
six
elegant
palaces
magnificently
furnished
,
either
in
the
city
,
or
in
different
parts
of
the
Riviera
.
<EOS>
The
two
streets
called
Strada
Balbi
and
Strada
Nuova
,
are
continued
double
ranges
of
palaces
adorned
with
gardens
and
fountains
:
but
their
being
painted
on
the
outside
has
,
in
my
opinion
,
a
poor
effect
.
  
<EOS>
The
commerce
of
this
city
is
,
at
present
,
not
very
considerable
;
yet
it
has
the
face
of
business
.
<EOS>
The
streets
are
crowded
with
people
;
the
shops
are
well
furnished
;
and
the
markets
abound
with
all
sorts
of
excellent
provision
.
<EOS>
The
wine
made
in
this
neighbourhood
is
,
however
,
very
indifferent
;
and
all
that
is
consumed
must
be
bought
at
the
public
cantine
,
where
it
is
sold
for
the
benefit
of
the
state
.
<EOS>
Their
bread
is
the
whitest
and
the
best
I
have
tasted
any
where
;
and
the
beef
,
which
they
have
from
Piedmont
,
is
juicy
and
delicious
.
<EOS>
The
expence
of
eating
in
Italy
is
nearly
the
same
as
in
France
,
about
three
shillings
a
head
for
every
meal
.
<EOS>
The
state
of
Genoa
is
very
poor
,
and
their
bank
of
St
George
has
received
such
rude
shocks
,
first
from
the
revolt
of
the
Corsicans
,
and
afterwards
from
the
misfortunes
of
the
city
,
when
it
was
taken
by
the
Austrians
in
the
war
of
1745
,
that
it
still
continues
to
languish
without
any
near
prospect
of
its
credit
being
restored
.
<EOS>
Nothing
shews
the
weakness
of
their
state
,
more
than
their
having
recourse
to
the
assistance
of
France
to
put
a
stop
to
the
progress
of
Paoli
in
Corsica
;
for
after
all
that
has
been
said
of
the
gallantry
and
courage
of
Paoli
and
his
islanders
<EOS>
,
I
am
very
credibly
informed
that
they
might
be
very
easily
suppressed
,
if
the
Genoese
had
either
vigour
in
the
council
or
resolution
in
the
field
.
  
<EOS>
True
it
is
,
they
made
a
noble
effort
in
expelling
the
Austrians
who
had
taken
possession
of
their
city
;
but
this
effort
was
the
effect
of
oppression
and
despair
,
and
if
I
may
believe
the
insinuations
of
some
politicians
in
this
part
of
the
world
,
the
Genoese
would
not
have
succeeded
in
that
attempt
,
if
they
had
not
previously
purchased
with
a
large
sum
of
money
the
connivance
of
the
only
person
who
could
defeat
the
enterprize
.
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
can
scarce
entertain
thoughts
so
prejudicial
to
the
character
of
human
nature
,
as
to
suppose
a
man
capable
of
sacrificing
to
such
a
consideration
,
the
duty
he
owed
his
prince
,
as
well
as
all
regard
to
the
lives
of
his
soldiers
,
even
those
who
lay
sick
in
hospitals
,
and
who
,
being
dragged
forth
,
were
miserably
butchered
by
the
furious
populace
.
<EOS>
There
is
one
more
presumption
of
his
innocence
,
he
still
retains
the
favour
of
his
sovereign
,
who
could
not
well
be
supposed
to
share
in
the
booty
.
<EOS>
"
There
are
mysteries
in
politics
which
were
never
dreamed
of
in
our
philosophy

Horatio

"
<EOS>
The
possession
of
Genoa
might
have
proved
a
troublesome
bone
of
contention
,
which
it
might
be
convenient
to
lose
by
accident
.
<EOS>
Certain
it
is
,
when
the
Austrians
returned
after
their
expulsion
,
in
order
to
retake
the
city
,
the
engineer
,
being
questioned
by
the
general
,
declared
he
would
take
the
place
in
fifteen
days
,
on
pain
of
losing
his
head
;
and
in
four
days
after
this
declaration
the
Austrians
retired
.
<EOS>
This
anecdote
I
learned
from
a
worthy
gentleman
of
this
country
,
who
had
it
from
the
engineer
's
own
mouth
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
was
the
will
of
heaven
.
<EOS>
You
see
how
favourably
,
providence
has
interposed
in
behalf
of
the
reigning
empress
of
Russia
,
first
in
removing
her
husband
:
secondly
in
ordaining
the
assassination
of
prince
Ivan
,
for
which
the
perpetrators
have
been
so
liberally
rewarded
;
it
even
seems
determined
to
shorten
the
life
of
her
own
son
,
the
only
surviving
rival
from
whom
she
had
any
thing
to
fear
.
  
<EOS>
The
Genoese
have
now
thrown
themselves
into
the
arms
of
France
for
protection
:
<EOS>
I
know
not
whether
it
would
not
have
been
a
greater
mark
of
sagacity
to
cultivate
the
friendship
of
England
,
with
which
they
carry
on
an
advantageous
commerce
.
<EOS>
While
the
English
are
masters
of
the
Mediterranean
,
they
will
always
have
it
in
their
power
to
do
incredible
damage
all
along
the
Riviera
,
to
ruin
the
Genoese
trade
by
sea
,
and
even
to
annoy
the
capital
;
for
notwithstanding
all
the
pains
they
have
taken
to
fortify
the
mole
and
the
city
,
I
am
greatly
deceived
if
it
is
not
still
exposed
to
the
danger
,
not
only
of
a
bombardment
,
but
even
of
a
cannonade
.
<EOS>
I
am
even
sanguine
enough
to
think
a
resolute
commander
might
,
with
a
strong
squadron
,
sail
directly
into
the
harbour
,
without
sustaining
much
damage
,
notwithstanding
all
the
cannon
of
the
place
,
which
are
said
to
amount
to
near
five
hundred
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
a
cannonade
of
above
four
hundred
pieces
of
artillery
,
besides
bombs
and
cohorns
,
maintained
for
many
hours
,
without
doing
much
mischief
.
  
<EOS>
During
the
last
siege
of
Genoa
,
the
French
auxiliaries
were
obliged
to
wait
at
Monaco
,
until
a
gale
of
wind
had
driven
the
English
squadron
off
the
coast
,
and
then
they
went
along
shore
in
small
vessels
at
the
imminent
risque
of
being
taken
by
the
British
cruisers
.
<EOS>
By
land
I
apprehend
their
march
would
be
altogether
impracticable
,
if
the
king
of
Sardinia
had
any
interest
to
oppose
it
.
<EOS>
He
might
either
guard
the
passes
,
or
break
up
the
road
in
twenty
different
places
,
so
as
to
render
it
altogether
impassable
.
<EOS>
Here
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
observe
,
that
when
Don
Philip
advanced
from
Nice
with
his
army
to
Genoa
,
he
was
obliged
to
march
so
close
to
the
shore
,
that
in
above
fifty
different
places
,
the
English
ships
might
have
rendered
the
road
altogether
impassable
.
<EOS>
The
path
,
which
runs
generally
along
the
face
of
a
precipice
washed
by
the
sea
,
is
so
narrow
that
two
men
on
horseback
can
hardly
pass
each
other
;
and
the
road
itself
so
rugged
,
slippery
,
and
dangerous
,
that
the
troopers
were
obliged
to
dismount
,
and
lead
their
horses
one
by
one
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
baron
de
Leutrum
,
who
was
at
the
head
of
a
large
body
of
Piedmontese
troops
,
had
it
in
his
power
to
block
up
the
passes
of
the
mountains
,
and
even
to
destroy
this
road
in
such
a
manner
,
that
the
enemy
could
not
possibly
advance
.
<EOS>
Why
these
precautions
were
not
taken
,
I
do
not
pretend
to
explain
:
neither
can
I
tell
you
wherefore
the
prince
of
Monaco
,
who
is
a
subject
and
partizan
of
France
,
was
indulged
with
a
neutrality
for
his
town
,
which
served
as
a
refreshing
-
place
,
a
safe
port
,
and
an
intermediate
post
for
the
French
succours
sent
from
Marseilles
to
Genoa
.
<EOS>
This
I
will
only
venture
to
affirm
,
that
the
success
and
advantage
of
great
alliances
are
often
sacrificed
to
low
,
partial
,
selfish
,
and
sordid
considerations
.
<EOS>
The
town
of
Monaco
is
commanded
by
every
heighth
in
its
neighbourhood
;
and
might
be
laid
in
ashes
by
a
bomb
-
ketch
in
four
hours
by
sea
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
fortunate
enough
to
be
recommended
to
a
lady
in
Genoa
,
who
treated
us
with
great
politeness
and
hospitality
.
<EOS>
She
introduced
me
to
an
abbate
,
a
man
of
letters
,
whose
conversation
was
extremely
agreeable
.
<EOS>
He
already
knew
me
by
reputation
,
and
offered
to
make
me
known
to
some
of
the
first
persons
in
the
republic
,
with
whom
he
lived
in
intimacy
.
<EOS>
The
lady
is
one
of
the
most
intelligent
and
best
-
bred
persons
I
have
known
in
any
country
.
<EOS>
We
assisted
at
her
conversazione
,
which
was
numerous
.
<EOS>
She
pressed
us
to
pass
the
winter
at
Genoa
;
and
indeed
I
was
almost
persuaded
:
but
<EOS>
I
had
attachments
at
Nice
,
from
which
I
could
not
easily
disengage
myself
.
  
<EOS>
The
few
days
we
staved
at
Genoa
were
employed
in
visiting
the
most
remarkable
churches
and
palaces
.
<EOS>
In
some
of
the
churches
,
particularly
that
of
the
Annunciata
,
I
found
a
profusion
of
ornaments
,
which
had
more
magnificence
than
taste
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
great
number
of
pictures
;
but
very
few
of
them
are
capital
pieces
.
<EOS>
I
had
heard
much
of
the
ponte
Carignano
,
which
did
not
at
all
answer
my
expectation
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
bridge
that
unites
two
eminences
which
form
the
higher
part
of
the
city
,
and
the
houses
in
the
bottom
below
do
not
rise
so
high
as
the
springing
of
its
arches
.
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
at
all
curious
in
its
construction
,
nor
any
way
remarkable
,
except
the
heighth
of
the
piers
from
which
the
arches
are
sprung
.
<EOS>
Hard
by
the
bridge
there
is
an
elegant
church
,
from
the
top
of
which
you
have
a
very
rich
and
extensive
prospect
of
the
city
,
the
sea
and
the
adjacent
country
,
which
looks
like
a
continent
of
groves
and
villas
.
<EOS>
The
only
remarkable
circumstance
about
the
cathedral
,
which
is
Gothic
and
gloomy
,
is
the
chapel
where
the
pretended
bones
of
John
the
Baptist
are
deposited
,
and
in
which
thirty
silver
lamps
are
continually
burning
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
curiosity
to
see
the
palaces
of
Durazzo
and
Doria
,
but
it
required
more
trouble
to
procure
admission
than
I
was
willing
to
give
myself
:
as
for
the
arsenal
,
and
the
rostrum
of
an
ancient
galley
which
was
found
by
accident
in
dragging
the
harbour
,
I
postponed
seeing
them
till
my
return
.
  
<EOS>
Having
here
provided
myself
with
letters
of
credit
for
Florence
and
Rome
,
I
hired
the
same
boat
which
had
brought
us
hither
,
to
carry
us
forward
to
Lerici
,
which
is
a
small
town
<EOS>
about
half
way
between
Genoa
and
Leghorn
,
where
travellers
,
who
are
tired
of
the
sea
,
take
post
-
chaises
to
continue
their
route
by
land
to
Pisa
and
Florence
.
<EOS>
I
payed
three
loui'dores
for
this
voyage
of
about
fifty
miles
;
though
I
might
have
had
a
feluca
for
less
money
.
<EOS>
When
you
land
on
the
wharf
at
Genoa
,
you
are
plied
by
the
feluca
men
just
as
you
are
plied
by
the
watermen
at
Hungerford
-
stairs
in
London
.
<EOS>
They
are
always
ready
to
set
off
at
a
minute
's
warning
for
Lerici
,
Leghorn
,
Nice
,
Antibes
,
Marseilles
,
and
every
part
of
the
Riviera
.
  
<EOS>
The
wind
being
still
unfavourable
,
though
the
weather
was
delightful
,
we
rowed
along
shore
,
passing
by
several
pretty
towns
,
villages
,
and
a
vast
number
of
cassines
,
or
little
white
houses
,
scattered
among
woods
of
olive
-
trees
,
that
cover
the
hills
;
and
these
are
the
habitations
of
the
velvet
and
damask
weavers
.
<EOS>
Turning
Capo
Fino
we
entered
a
bay
,
where
stand
the
towns
of
Porto
Fino
,
Lavagna
,
and
Sestri
di
Levante
,
at
which
last
we
took
up
our
night
's
lodging
.
<EOS>
The
house
was
tolerable
,
and
we
had
no
great
reason
to
complain
of
the
beds
:
but
,
the
weather
being
hot
,
there
was
a
very
offensive
smell
,
which
proceeded
from
some
skins
of
beasts
new
killed
,
that
were
spread
to
dry
on
an
outhouse
in
the
yard
.
<EOS>
Our
landlord
was
a
butcher
,
and
had
very
much
the
looks
of
an
assassin
.
<EOS>
His
wife
was
a
great
masculine
virago
,
who
had
all
the
air
of
having
frequented
the
slaughter
-
house
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
being
welcomed
with
looks
of
complaisance
,
we
were
admitted
with
a
sort
of
gloomy
condescension
,
which
seemed
to
say
,
"
We
do
n't
much
like
your
company
;
but
,
however
,
you
shall
have
a
night
's
lodging
in
favour
of
the
patron
of
the
gondola
,
who
is
our
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
"
In
short
,
we
had
a
very
bad
supper
,
miserably
dressed
,
passed
a
very
disagreeable
night
,
and
payed
a
very
extravagant
bill
in
the
morning
,
without
being
thanked
for
our
custom
.
<EOS>
I
was
very
glad
to
get
out
of
the
house
with
my
throat
uncut
.
  
<EOS>
Sestri
di
Levante
is
a
little
town
pleasantly
situated
on
the
seaside
;
but
has
not
the
conveniency
of
a
harbour
.
<EOS>
The
fish
taken
here
is
mostly
carried
to
Genoa
.
<EOS>
This
is
likewise
the
market
for
their
oil
,
and
the
paste
called
macaroni
,
of
which
they
make
a
good
quantity
.
  
<EOS>
Next
day
,
we
skirted
a
very
barren
coast
,
consisting
of
almost
perpendicular
rocks
,
on
the
faces
of
which
,
however
,
we
saw
many
peasants
'
houses
and
hanging
terraces
for
vines
,
made
by
dint
of
incredible
labour
.
<EOS>
In
the
afternoon
,
we
entered
by
the
Porti
di
Venere
into
the
bay
,
or
gulf
of
Spetia
or
Spezza
,
which
was
the
Portus
Lunae
of
the
ancients
.

This
bay
,
at
the
mouth
of
which
lies
the
island
Palmaria
,
forms
a
most
noble
and
secure
harbour
,
capacious
enough
to
contain
all
the
navies
in
Christendom
.
<EOS>
The
entrance
on
one
side
is
defended
by
a
small
fort
built
above
the
town
of
Porto
Venere
,
which
is
a
very
poor
place
.
<EOS>
Farther
in
there
is
a
battery
of
about
twenty
guns
;
and
on
the
right
hand
,
opposite
to
Porto
Venere
,
is
a
block
-
house
,
founded
on
a
rock
in
the
sea
.
<EOS>
At
the
bottom
of
the
bay
is
the
town
of
Spetia
on
the
left
,
and
on
the
right
that
of
Lerici
,
defended
by
a
castle
of
very
little
strength
or
consequence
.
<EOS>
The
whole
bay
is
surrounded
with
plantations
of
olives
and
oranges
,
and
makes
a
very
delightful
appearance
.
<EOS>
In
case
of
a
war
,
this
would
be
an
admirable
station
for
a
British
squadron
,
as
it
lies
so
near
Genoa
and
Leghorn
;
and
has
a
double
entrance
,
by
means
of
which
the
cruisers
could
sail
in
and
out
continually
,
which
way
soever
the
wind
might
chance
to
sit
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
the
fortifications
would
give
very
little
disturbance
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
post
-
house
in
Lerici
,
the
accommodation
is
intolerable
.
<EOS>
We
were
almost
poisoned
at
supper
.
<EOS>
I
found
the
place
where
I
was
to
lie
so
close
and
confined
,
that
I
could
not
breathe
in
it
,
and
therefore
lay
all
night
in
an
outward
room
upon
four
chairs
,
with
a
leather
portmanteau
for
my
pillow
.
<EOS>
For
this
entertainment
I
payed
very
near
a
loui'dore
.
<EOS>
Such
bad
accommodation
is
the
less
excusable
,
as
the
fellow
has
a
great
deal
of
business
,
this
being
a
great
thoroughfare
for
travellers
going
into
Italy
,
or
returning
from
thence
.
  
<EOS>
I
might
have
saved
some
money
by
prosecuting
my
voyage
directly
by
sea
to
Leghorn
:
but
,
by
this
time
,
we
were
all
heartily
tired
of
the
water
,
the
business
then
was
to
travel
by
land
to
Florence
,
by
the
way
of
Pisa
,
which
is
seven
posts
distant
from
Lerici
.
<EOS>
Those
who
have
not
their
own
carriage
must
either
hire
chaises
to
perform
the
whole
journey
,
or
travel
by
way
of
cambiatura
,
which
is
that
of
changing
the
chaises
every
post
,
as
the
custom
is
in
England
.
<EOS>
In
this
case
the
great
inconvenience
arises
from
your
being
obliged
to
shift
your
baggage
every
post
.
<EOS>
The
chaise
or
calesse
of
this
country
,
is
a
wretched
machine
with
two
wheels
,
as
uneasy
as
a
common
cart
,
being
indeed
no
other
than
what
we
should
call
in
England
a
very
ill
-
contrived
one
-
horse
chair
,
narrow
,
naked
,
shattered
and
shabby
.
<EOS>
For
this
vehicle
and
two
horses
you
pay
at
the
rate
of
eight
paoli
a
stage
,
or
four
shillings
sterling
;
and
the
postilion
expects
two
paoli
for
his
gratification
:
so
that
every
eight
miles
cost
about
five
shillings
,
and
four
only
,
if
you
travel
in
your
own
carriage
,
as
in
that
case
you
pay
no
more
than
at
the
rate
of
three
paoli
a
horse
.
  
<EOS>
About
three
miles
from
Lerici
,
we
crossed
the
Magra
,
which
appeared
as
a
rivulet
almost
dry
,
and
in
half
a
mile
farther
arrived
at
Sarzana
,
a
small
town
at
the
extremity
of
the
Genoese
territories
,
where
we
changed
horses
.
<EOS>
Then
entering
the
principalities
of
Massa
and
Carrara
,
belonging
to
the
duke
of
Modena
,
we
passed
Lavenza
,
which
seems
to
be
a
decayed
fort
with
a
small
garrison
,
and
dined
at
Massa
,
which
is
an
agreeable
little
town
,
where
the
old
dutchess
of
Modena
resides
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
all
the
expedition
we
could
make
,
it
was
dark
before
we
passed
the
Cerchio
,
which
is
an
inconsiderable
stream
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Pisa
,
where
we
arrived
about
eight
in
the
evening
.
  
<EOS>
The
country
from
Sarzana
to
the
frontiers
of
Tuscany
is
a
narrow
plain
,
bounded
on
the
right
by
the
sea
,
and
on
the
left
by
the
Apennine
mountains
.
<EOS>
It
is
well
cultivated
and
inclosed
,
consisting
of
meadow
-
ground
,
corn
fields
,
plantations
of
olives
;
and
the
trees
that
form
the
hedge
-
rows
serve
as
so
many
props
to
the
vines
,
which
are
twisted
round
them
,
and
continued
from
one
to
another
.
<EOS>
After
entering
the
dominions
of
Tuscany
,
we
travelled
through
a
noble
forest
of
oak
-
trees
of
a
considerable
extent
,
which
would
have
appeared
much
more
agreeable
,
had
we
not
been
benighted
and
apprehensive
of
robbers
.
<EOS>
The
last
post
but
one
in
this
days
journey
,
is
at
the
little
town
of
Viareggio
,
a
kind
of
sea
-
port
on
the
Mediterranean
,
belonging
to
Lucia
.
<EOS>
The
roads
are
indifferent
,
and
the
accommodation
is
execrable
.
<EOS>
I
was
glad
to
find
myself
housed
in
a
very
good
inn
at
Pisa
,
where
I
promised
myself
a
good
night
's
rest
,
and
was
not
disappointed
.
<EOS>
I
heartily
wish
you
the
same
pleasure
,
and
am
very
sincerely
 
Yours

DEAR
SIR
,
 
Pisa
is
a
fine
old
city
that
strikes
you
with
the
same
veneration
you
would
feel
at
sight
of
an
antient
temple
which
bears
the
marks
of
decay
,
without
being
absolutely
dilapidated
.
<EOS>
The
houses
are
well
built
,
the
streets
open
,
straight
,
and
well
paved
;
the
shops
well
furnished
;
and
the
markets
well
supplied
:
there
are
some
elegant
palaces
,
designed
by
great
masters
.
<EOS>
The
churches
are
built
with
taste
,
and
tolerably
ornamented
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
beautiful
wharf
of
freestone
on
each
side
of
the
river
Arno
,
which
runs
through
the
city
,
and
three
bridges
thrown
over
it
,
of
which
that
in
the
middle
is
of
marble
,
a
pretty
piece
of
architecture
:
but
the
number
of
inhabitants
is
very
inconsiderable
;
and
this
very
circumstance
gives
it
an
air
of
majestic
solitude
,
which
is
far
from
being
unpleasant
to
a
man
of
a
contemplative
turn
of
mind
.
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
I
can
not
bear
the
tumult
of
a
populous
commercial
city
;
and
the
solitude
that
reigns
in
Pisa
would
with
me
be
a
strong
motive
to
choose
it
as
a
place
of
residence
.
<EOS>
Not
that
this
would
be
the
only
inducement
for
living
at
Pisa
.
<EOS>
Here
is
some
good
company
,
and
even
a
few
men
of
taste
and
learning
.
<EOS>
The
people
in
general
are
counted
sociable
and
polite
;
and
there
is
great
plenty
of
provisions
,
at
a
very
reasonable
rate
.
<EOS>
At
some
distance
from
the
more
frequented
parts
of
the
city
,
a
man
may
hire
a
large
house
for
thirty
crowns
a
year
:
but
near
the
center
,
you
can
not
have
good
lodgings
,
ready
furnished
,
for
less
than
a
scudo
(
about
five
shillings
)
a
day
.
<EOS>
The
air
in
summer
is
reckoned
unwholesome
by
the
exhalations
arising
from
stagnant
water
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
city
,
which
stands
in
the
midst
of
a
fertile
plain
,
low
and
marshy
:
yet
these
marshes
have
been
considerably
drained
,
and
the
air
is
much
meliorated
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
Arno
,
it
is
no
longer
navigated
by
vessels
of
any
burthen
.
<EOS>
The
university
of
Pisa
is
very
much
decayed
;
and
except
the
little
business
occasioned
by
the
emperor
's
gallies
,
which
are
built
in
this
town
,
[
This
is
a
mistake
.
<EOS>
No
gallies
have
been
built
here
for
a
great
many
years
,
and
the
dock
is
now
converted
into
stables
for
the
Grand
Duke
's
Horse
Guards
.
]
<EOS>
I
know
of
no
commerce
it
carried
on
:
perhaps
the
inhabitants
live
on
the
produce
of
the
country
,
which
consists
of
corn
,
wine
,
and
cattle
.
<EOS>
They
are
supplied
with
excellent
water
for
drinking
,
by
an
aqueduct
consisting
of
above
five
thousand
arches
,
begun
by
Cosmo
,
and
finished
by
Ferdinand
I
Grand
-
dukes
of
Tuscany
;
it
conveys
the
water
from
the
mountains
at
the
distance
of
five
miles
.
<EOS>
This
noble
city
,
formerly
the
capital
of
a
flourishing
and
powerful
republic
,
which
contained
above
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
inhabitants
,
within
its
walls
,
is
now
so
desolate
that
grass
grows
in
the
open
streets
;
and
the
number
of
its
people
do
not
exceed
sixteen
thousand
.
  
<EOS>
You
need
not
doubt
<EOS>
but
I
visited
the
Campanile
,
or
hanging
-
tower
,
which
is
a
beautiful
cylinder
of
eight
stories
,
<EOS>
each
adorned
with
a
round
of
columns
,
rising
one
above
another
.
<EOS>
It
stands
by
the
cathedral
,
and
inclines
so
far
on
one
side
from
the
perpendicular
,
that
in
dropping
a
plummet
from
the
top
,
which
is
one
hundred
and
eighty
-
eight
feet
high
,
it
falls
sixteen
feet
from
the
base
.
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
I
should
never
have
dreamed
that
this
inclination
proceeded
from
any
other
cause
,
than
an
accidental
subsidence
of
the
foundation
on
this
side
,
if
some
connoisseurs
had
not
taken
great
pains
to
prove
it
was
done
on
purpose
by
the
architect
.
<EOS>
Any
person
who
has
eyes
may
see
that
the
pillars
on
that
side
are
considerably
sunk
;
and
this
is
the
case
with
the
very
threshold
of
the
door
by
which
you
enter
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
would
have
been
a
very
preposterous
ambition
in
the
architects
,
to
show
how
far
they
could
deviate
from
the
perpendicular
in
this
construction
;
because
in
that
particular
any
common
mason
could
have
rivalled
them
;
[
All
the
world
knows
that
a
Building
with
such
Inclination
may
be
carried
up
till
a
line
drawn
from
the
Centre
of
Gravity
falls
without
the
Circumference
of
the
Base
.
]
<EOS>
and
if
they
really
intended
it
as
a
specimen
of
their
art
,
they
should
have
shortened
the
pilasters
on
that
side
,
so
as
to
exhibit
them
intire
,
without
the
appearance
of
sinking
.
<EOS>
These
leaning
towers
are
not
unfrequent
in
Italy
;
there
is
one
at
Bologna
,
another
at
Venice
,
a
third
betwixt
Venice
and
Ferrara
,
and
a
fourth
at
Ravenna
;
and
the
inclination
in
all
of
them
has
been
supposed
owing
to
the
foundations
giving
way
on
one
side
only
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
cathedral
,
which
is
a
large
Gothic
pile
,
[
This
Edifice
is
not
absolutely
Gothic
.
<EOS>
It
was
built
in
the
Twelfth
Century
after
the
Design
of
a
Greek
Architect
from
Constantinople
,
where
by
that
time
the
art
was
much
degenerated
.
<EOS>
The
Pillars
of
Granite
are
mostly
from
the
Islands
of
Ebba
and
Giglia
on
the
coast
of
Tuscany
,
where
those
quarries
were
worked
by
the
antient
Romans

<EOS>
The
Giullo
,
and
the
verde
antico
are
very
beautiful
species
of
marble
,
yellow
and
green
;
the
first
,
antiently
called
marmor
numidicum
,
came
from
Africa
;
the
other
was
found
(
according
to
Strabo
)
on
the
mons
Taygetus
in
Lacedemonia
:
but
,
at
present
,
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
is
to
be
had
except
among
the
ruins
of
antiquity
.

<EOS>
there
is
a
great
number
of
massy
pillars
of
porphyry
,
granite
,
jasper
,
giullo
,
and
verde
antico
,
together
with
some
good
pictures
and
statues
:
but
the
greatest
curiosity
is
that
of
the
brass
-
gates
,
designed
and
executed
by
John
of
Bologna
,
representing
,
embossed
in
different
compartments
,
the
history
of
the
Old
and
New
Testament
.
<EOS>
I
was
so
charmed
with
this
work
,
that
I
could
have
stood
a
whole
day
to
examine
and
admire
it
.
<EOS>
In
the
Baptisterium
,
which
stands
opposite
to
this
front
,
there
are
some
beautiful
marbles
,
particularly
the
font
,
and
a
pulpit
,
supported
by
the
statues
of
different
animals
.
  
<EOS>
Between
the
cathedral
and
this
building
,
about
one
hundred
paces
on
one
side
,
is
the
famous
burying
-
ground
,
called
Campo
Santo
,
from
its
being
covered
with
earth
brought
from
Jerusalem
.
<EOS>
It
is
an
oblong
square
,
surrounded
by
a
very
high
wall
,
and
always
kept
shut
.
<EOS>
Within
-
side
there
is
a
spacious
corridore
round
the
whole
space
,
which
is
a
noble
walk
for
a
contemplative
philosopher
.
<EOS>
It
is
paved
chiefly
with
flat
grave
-
stones
:
the
walls
are
painted
in
fresco
by
Ghiotto
,
Giottino
,
Stefano
,
Bennoti
,
Bufalmaco
,
and
some
others
of
his
cotemporaries
and
disciples
,
who
flourished
immediately
after
the
restoration
of
painting
.
<EOS>
The
subjects
are
taken
from
the
Bible
.
<EOS>
Though
the
manner
is
dry
,
the
drawing
incorrect
,
the
design
generally
lame
,
and
the
colouring
unnatural
;
yet
there
is
merit
in
the
expression
:
and
the
whole
remains
as
a
curious
monument
of
the
efforts
made
by
this
noble
art
immediately
after
her
revival
.

[
The
History

Job

<EOS>
Here
are
some
deceptions
in
perspective
equally
ingenious
and
pleasing
;
particularly
the
figures
of
certain
animals

which
exhibit
exactly
the
same
appearance

from
whatever
different

One
division
of
the
burying
-
ground
consists
of
a
particular
compost
,
which
in
nine
days
consumes
the
dead
bodies
to
the
bones
:
in
all
probability
,
it
is
no
other
than
common
earth
mixed
with
quick

At
one
corner
of
the
corridore
,
there
are
the
pictures
of
three
bodies
represented
in
the
three
different
stages
of
putrefaction
which
they
undergo
when
laid
in
this
composition

<EOS>
At
the
end
of
the
three
first
days

the
body
is
bloated
and
swelled
,
and
the
features
are
enlarged
and
distorted
to
such
a
degree
,
as
fills
the
spectator
with
horror

At
the
sixth
day
,
the
swelling
is
subsided
,

all
the
muscular
flesh
hangs
loosened
from
the
bones

at
the
ninth

nothing
but
the
skeleton
remains

the
Pisan
Fleets

I
was
struck
with
the
figure
of
a
woman
lying
dead
on
a
tomb
-
stone
,
covered
with
a
piece
of
thin
drapery
,
so
delicately
cut
as
to
shew
all
the
flexures
of
the
attitude
,
and
even
all
the
swellings
and
sinuosities
of
the
muscles
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
stone
,
it
looks
like
a
sheet
of
wet
linen
.

One
of
these
antiquities
representing
the
Hunting
of
Meleager
was
converted
into
a
coffin
for
the
Countess
Beatrice
,
mother
of
the
famous
Countess
Mathilda
;
it
is
now
fixed
to
the
outside
of
the
church
wall
just
by
one
of
the
doors
,
and
is
a
very
elegant
piece
of
sculpture
.
<EOS>
Near
the
same
place
is
a
fine
pillar
of
Porphyry
supporting
the
figure
of
a
Lion
,
and
a
kind
of
urn
which
seems
to
be
a
Sarcophagus
,
though
an
inscription
round
the
Base
declares
it
is
a
Talentum
in
which
the
antient
Pisans
measured
the
Census
or
Tax
which
they
payed
to
Augustus
:
<EOS>
but
in
what
metal
or
specie
this
Census
was
payed
we
are
left
to
divine
.
<EOS>
There
are
likewise
in
the
Campo
Santo
two
antique
Latin
edicts
of
the
Pisan
Senate
injoining
the
citizens
to
go
into
mourning
for
the
Death
of
Caius
and
Lucius
Caesar
the
Sons
of
Agrippa

Fronting
this
Cemetery

on
the
other
side

the
Piazza

a
large

elegant
Hospital

conveniently

comfortably
lodged

<EOS>
For
four
zechines
I
hired
a
return
-
coach
and
four
from
Pisa
to
Florence
.
<EOS>
This
road
,
which
lies
along
the
Arno
,
is
very
good
;
and
the
country
is
delightful
,
variegated
with
hill
and
vale
,
wood
and
water
,
meadows
and
corn
-
fields
,
planted
and
inclosed
like
the
counties
of
Middlesex
and
Hampshire
;
with
this
difference
,
however
,
that
all
the
trees
in
this
tract
were
covered
with
vines
,
and
the
ripe
clusters
black
and
white
,
hung
down
from
every
bough
in
a
most
luxuriant
and
romantic
abundance
.
<EOS>
The
vines
in
this
country
are
not
planted
in
rows
,
and
propped
with
sticks
,
as
in
France
and
the
county
of
Nice
,
but
twine
around
the
hedge-
row
trees
,
which
they
almost
quite
cover
with
their
foliage
and
fruit
.
<EOS>
The
branches
of
the
vine
are
extended
from
tree
to
tree
,
exhibiting
beautiful
festoons
of
real
leaves
,
tendrils
,
and
swelling
clusters
a
foot
long
.
<EOS>
By
this
oeconomy
the
ground
of
the
inclosure
is
spared
for
corn
,
grass
,
or
any
other
production
.
<EOS>
The
trees
commonly
planted
for
the
purpose
of
sustaining
the
vines
,
are
maple
,
elm
,
and
aller
,
with
which
last
the
banks
of
the
Arno
abound
.
<EOS>
[
It
would
have
been
still
more
for
the
advantage
of
the
Country
and
the
Prospect
,
if
instead
of
these
they
had
planted
fruit
trees
for
the
purpose
.

<EOS>
This
river
,
which
is
very
inconsiderable
with
respect
to
the
quantity
of
water
,
would
be
a
charming
pastoral
stream
,
if
it
was
transparent
;
but
it
is
always
muddy
and
discoloured
.
<EOS>
About
ten
or
a
dozen
miles
below
Florence
,
there
are
some
marble
quarries
on
the
side
of
it
,
<EOS>
from
whence
the
blocks
are
conveyed
in
boats
,
when
there
is
water
enough
in
the
river
to
float
them
,
that
is
after
heavy
rains
,
or
the
melting
of
the
snow
upon
the
mountains
of
Umbria
,
being
part
of
the
Apennines
,
from
whence
it
takes
its
rise
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
is
a
noble
city
,
that
still
retains
all
the
marks
of
a
majestic
capital
,
such
as
piazzas
,
palaces
,
fountains
,
bridges
,
statues
,
and
arcades
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
te11
you
that
the
churches
here
are
magnificent
,
and
adorned
not
only
with
pillars
of
oriental
granite
,
porphyry
,
Jasper
,
verde
antico
,
and
other
precious
stones
;
but
also
with
capital
pieces
of
painting
by
the
most
eminent
masters
.
<EOS>
Several
of
these
churches
,
however
,
stand
without
fronts
,
for
want
of
money
to
complete
the
plans
.
<EOS>
It
may
also
appear
superfluous
to
mention
my
having
viewed
the
famous
gallery
of
antiquities
,
the
chapel
of
St
Lorenzo
,
the
palace
of
Pitti
,
the
cathedral
,
the
baptisterium
,
Ponte
de
Trinita
,
with
its
statues
,
the
triumphal
arch
,
and
every
thing
which
is
commonly
visited
in
this
metropolis
.
<EOS>
But
all
these
objects
having
been
circumstantially
described
by
twenty
different
authors
of
travels
,
I
shall
not
trouble
you
with
a
repetition
of
trite
observations
.
  
<EOS>
That
part
of
the
city
which
stands
on
each
side
of
the
river
,
makes
a
very
elegant
appearance
,
to
which
the
four
bridges
and
the
stone
-
quay
between
them
,
contribute
in
a
great
measure
.
<EOS>
I
lodged
at
the
widow
<EOS>
Vanini
's
,
an
English
house
delightfully
situated
in
this
quarter
.
<EOS>
The
landlady
,
who
is
herself
a
native
of
England
,
we
found
very
obliging
.
<EOS>
The
lodging
-
rooms
are
comfortable
;
and
the
entertainment
is
good
and
reasonable
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
considerable
number
of
fashionable
people
at
Florence
,
and
many
of
them
in
good
circumstances
.
<EOS>
They
affect
a
gaiety
in
their
dress
,
equipage
,
and
conversation
;
but
stand
very
much
on
their
punctilio
with
strangers
;
and
will
not
,
without
great
reluctance
,
admit
into
their
assemblies
any
lady
of
another
country
,
whose
noblesse
is
not
ascertained
by
a
title
.
<EOS>
This
reserve
is
in
some
measure
excusable
among
a
people
who
are
extremely
ignorant
of
foreign
customs
,
and
who
know
that
in
their
own
country
,
every
person
,
even
the
most
insignificant
,
who
has
any
pretensions
to
family
,
either
inherits
,
or
assumes
the
title
of
principe
,
conte
,
or
marchese
.
  
<EOS>
With
all
their
pride
,
however
,
the
nobles
of
Florence
are
humble
enough
to
enter
into
partnership
with
shop
-
keepers
,
and
even
to
sell
wine
by
retail
.
<EOS>
It
is
an
undoubted
fact
,
that
in
every
palace
or
great
house
in
this
city
,
there
is
a
little
window
fronting
the
street
,
provided
with
an
iron
-
knocker
,
and
over
it
hangs
an
empty
flask
,
by
way
of
sign
-
post
.
<EOS>
Thither
you
send
your
servant
to
buy
a
bottle
of
wine
.
<EOS>
He
knocks
at
the
little
wicket
,
which
is
opened
immediately
by
a
domestic
,
who
supplies
him
with
what
he
wants
,
and
receives
the
money
like
the
waiter
of
any
other
cabaret
.
<EOS>
It
is
pretty
extraordinary
,
that
it
should
not
be
deemed
a
disparagement
in
a
nobleman
to
sell
half
a
pound
of
figs
,
or
a
palm
of
ribbon
or
tape
,
or
to
take
money
for
a
flask
of
sour
wine
;
and
yet
be
counted
infamous
to
match
his
daughter
in
the
family
of
a
person
who
has
distinguished
himself
in
any
one
of
the
learned
professions
.
  
<EOS>
Though
Florence
be
tolerably
populous
,
there
seems
to
be
very
little
trade
of
any
kind
in
it
:
but
the
inhabitants
flatter
themselves
with
the
prospect
of
reaping
great
advantage
from
the
residence
of
one
of
the
arch
-
dukes
,
for
whose
reception
they
are
now
repairing
the
palace
of
Pitti
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
the
revenues
of
Tuscany
may
amount
to
,
since
the
succession
of
the
princes
of
Lorraine
;
but
,
under
the
last
dukes
of
the
Medici
family
,
they
were
said
to
produce
two
millions
of
crowns
,
equal
to
five
hundred
thousand
pounds
sterling
.
<EOS>
These
arose
from
a
very
heavy
tax
upon
land
and
houses
,
the
portions
of
maidens
,
and
suits
at
law
,
besides
the
duties
upon
traffick
,
a
severe
gabelle
upon
the
necessaries
of
life
,
and
a
toll
upon
every
eatable
entered
into
this
capital
.
<EOS>
If
we
may
believe
Leti
,
the
grand
duke
was
then
able
to
raise
and
maintain
an
army
of
forty
thousand
infantry
,
and
three
thousand
horse
;
with
twelve
gallies
,
two
galeasses
,
and
twenty
ships
of
war
.
<EOS>
I
question
if
Tuscany
can
maintain
at
present
above
one
half
of
such
an
armament
.
<EOS>
He
that
now
commands
the
emperor
's
navy
,
consisting
of
a
few
frigates
,
is
an
Englishman
,
called
Acton
,
who
was
heretofore
captain
of
a
ship
in
our
East
India
company
's
service
.
<EOS>
He
has
lately
embraced
the
catholic
religion
,
and
been
created
admiral
of
Tuscany
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
a
tolerable
opera
in
Florence
for
the
entertainment
of
the
best
company
,
though
they
do
not
seem
very
attentive
to
the
musick
.
<EOS>
Italy
is
certainly
the
native
country
of
this
art
;
and
yet
,
I
do
not
find
the
people
in
general
either
more
musically
inclined
,
or
better
provided
with
ears
than
their
neighbours
.
<EOS>
Here
is
also
a
wretched
troop
of
comedians
for
the
burgeois
,
and
lower
class
of
people
:
but
what
seems
most
to
suit
the
taste
of
all
ranks
,
is
the
exhibition
of
church
pageantry
.
<EOS>
I
had
occasion
to
see
a
procession
,
where
all
the
noblesse
of
the
city
attended
in
their
coaches
,
which
filled
the
whole
length
of
the
great
street
called
the
Corso
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
anniversary
of
a
charitable
institution
in
favour
of
poor
maidens
,
a
certain
number
of
whom
are
portioned
every
year
.
<EOS>
About
two
hundred
of
these
virgins
walked
in
procession
,
two
and
two
together
,
cloathed
in
violet
-
coloured
wide
gowns
,
with
white
veils
on
their
heads
,
and
made
a
very
classical
appearance
.
<EOS>
They
were
preceded
and
followed
by
an
irregular
mob
of
penitents
in
sack
-
cloth
,
with
lighted
tapers
,
and
monks
carrying
crucifixes
,
bawling
and
bellowing
the
litanies
:
but
the
great
object
was
a
figure
of
the
Virgin
Mary
,
as
big
as
the
life
,
standing
within
a
gilt
frame
,
dressed
in
a
gold
stuff
,
with
a
large
hoop
,
a
great
quantity
of
false
jewels
<EOS>
,
her
face
painted
and
patched
,
and
her
hair
frizzled
and
curled
in
the
very
extremity
of
the
fashion
.
<EOS>
Very
little
regard
had
been
paid
to
the
image
of
our
Saviour
on
the
cross
;
but
when
his
lady
-
mother
appeared
on
the
shoulders
of
three
or
four
lusty
friars
,
the
whole
populace
fell
upon
their
knees
in
the
dirt
.
<EOS>
This
extraordinary
veneration
paid
to
the
Virgin
,
must
have
been
derived
originally
from
the
French
,
who
pique
themselves
on
their
gallantry
to
the
fair
sex
.
  
<EOS>
Amidst
all
the
scenery
of
the
Roman
catholic
religion
,
I
have
never
yet
seen
any
of
the
spectators
affected
at
heart
,
or
discover
the
least
signs
of
fanaticism
.
<EOS>
The
very
disciplinants
,
who
scourge
themselves
in
the
Holy
-
week
,
are
generally
peasants
or
parties
hired
for
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
Those
of
the
confrairies
,
who
have
an
ambition
to
distinguish
themselves
on
such
occasions
,
take
care
to
secure
their
backs
from
the
smart
,
by
means
of
secret
armour
,
either
women
's
boddice
,
or
quilted
jackets
.
<EOS>
The
confrairies
are
fraternities
of
devotees
,
who
inlist
themselves
under
the
banners
of
particular
saints
.
<EOS>
On
days
of
procession
they
appear
in
a
body
dressed
as
penitents
and
masked
,
and
distinguished
by
crosses
on
their
habits
.
<EOS>
There
is
scarce
an
individual
,
whether
noble
or
plebeian
,
who
does
not
belong
to
one
of
these
associations
,
which
may
be
compared
to
the
FreeMasons
,
Gregoreans
,
and
Antigallicans
of
England
.
  
<EOS>
Just
without
one
of
the
gates
of
Florence
,
there
is
a
triumphal
arch
erected
on
occasion
of
the
late
emperor
's
making
his
public
entry
,
when
he
succeeded
to
the
dukedom
of
Tuscany
:
and
herein
the
summer
evenings
,
the
quality
resort
to
take
the
air
in
their
coaches
.
<EOS>
Every
carriage
stops
,
and
forms
a
little
separate
conversazione
.
<EOS>
The
ladies
sit
within
,
and
the
cicisbei
stand
on
the
foot
-
boards
,
on
each
side
of
the
coach
,
entertaining
them
with
their
discourse
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
no
unpleasant
inquiry
to
trace
this
sort
of
gallantry
to
its
original
,
and
investigate
all
its
progress
.
<EOS>
The
Italians
,
having
been
accused
of
jealousy
,
were
resolved
to
wipe
off
the
reproach
,
and
,
seeking
to
avoid
it
for
the
future
,
have
run
into
the
other
extreme
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
is
generally
supposed
that
the
custom
of
choosing
cicisbei
,
was
calculated
to
prevent
the
extinction
of
families
,
which
would
otherwise
often
happen
in
consequence
of
marriages
founded
upon
interest
,
without
any
mutual
affection
in
the
contracting
parties
.
<EOS>
How
far
this
political
consideration
may
have
weighed
against
the
jealous
and
vindictive
temper
of
the
Italians
,
I
will
not
pretend
to
judge
:
but
,
certain
it
is
,
every
married
lady
in
this
country
has
her
cicisbeo
,
or
servente
,
who
attends
her
<EOS>
every
where
,
and
on
all
occasions
;
and
upon
whose
privileges
the
husband
dares
not
encroach
,
without
incurring
the
censure
and
ridicule
of
the
whole
community
.
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
I
would
rather
be
condemned
for
life
to
the
gallies
,
than
exercise
the
office
of
a
cicisbeo
,
exposed
to
the
intolerable
caprices
and
dangerous
resentment
of
an
Italian
virago
.
<EOS>
I
pretend
not
to
judge
of
the
national
character
,
from
my
own
observation
:
but
,
if
the
portraits
drawn
by
Goldoni
in
his
Comedies
are
taken
from
nature
,
I
would
not
hesitate
to
pronounce
the
Italian
women
the
most
haughty
,
insolent
,
capricious
,
and
revengeful
females
on
the
face
of
the
earth
.
<EOS>
Indeed
their
resentments
are
so
cruelly
implacable
,
and
contain
such
a
mixture
of
perfidy
,
that
,
in
my
opinion
,
they
are
very
unfit
subjects
for
comedy
,
whose
province
it
is
,
rather
to
ridicule
folly
than
to
stigmatize
such
atrocious
vice
.
  
<EOS>
You
have
often
heard
it
said
,
that
the
purity
of
the
Italian
is
to
be
found
in
the
lingua
Toscana
,
and
bocca
Romana
.
<EOS>
Certain
it
is
,
the
pronunciation
of
the
Tuscans
is
disagreeably
guttural
:
the
letters
C
and
G
they
pronounce
with
an
aspiration
,
which
hurts
the
ear
of
an
Englishman
;
and
is
I
think
rather
rougher
than
that
of
the
X
,
in
Spanish
.
<EOS>
It
sounds
as
if
the
speaker
had
lost
his
palate
.
<EOS>
I
really
imagined
the
first
man
I
heard
speak
in
Pisa
,
had
met
with
that
misfortune
in
the
course
of
his
amours
.
  
<EOS>
One
of
the
greatest
curiosities
you
meet
with
in
Italy
,
is
the
Improvisatore
;
such
is
the
name
given
to
certain
individuals
,
who
have
the
surprising
talent
of
reciting
verses
extempore
,
on
any
subject
you
propose
.
<EOS>
Mr
Corvesi
,
my
landlord
,
has
a
son
,
a
Franciscan
friar
,
who
is
a
great
genius
in
this
way
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
subject
is
given
,
his
brother
tunes
his
violin
to
accompany
him
,
and
he
begins
to
rehearse
in
recitative
,
with
wonderful
fluency
and
precision
.
<EOS>
Thus
he
will
,
at
a
minute
's
warning
,
recite
two
or
three
hundred
verses
,
well
turned
,
and
well
adapted
,
and
generally
mingled
with
an
elegant
compliment
to
the
company
.
<EOS>
The
Italians
are
so
fond
of
poetry
,
that
many
of
them
,
have
the
best
part
of
Ariosto
,
Tasso
,
and
Petrarch
,
by
heart
;
and
these
are
the
great
sources
from
which
the
Improvisatori
draw
their
rhimes
,
cadence
,
and
turns
of
expression
.
<EOS>
But
,
lest
you
should
think
there
is
neither
rhime
nor
reason
in
protracting
this
tedious
epistle
,
I
shall
conclude
it
with
the
old
burden
of
my
song
,
that
I
am
always
 
Your
affectionate
humble
servant

<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
Your
entertaining
letter
of
the
fifth
of
last
month
,
was
a
very
charitable
and
a
very
agreeable
donation
:
but
your
suspicion
is
groundless
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
upon
my
honour
,
I
have
no
share
whatever
in
any
of
the
disputes
which
agitate
the
public
:
nor
do
I
know
any
thing
of
your
political
transactions
,
except
what
I
casually
see
in
one
of
your
newspapers
,
with
the
perusal
of
which
I
am
sometimes
favoured
by
our
consul
at
Villefranche
.
<EOS>
You
insist
upon
my
being
more
particular
in
my
remarks
on
what
I
saw
at
Florence
,
and
I
shall
obey
the
injunction
.
<EOS>
The
famous
gallery
which
contains
the
antiquities
,
is
the
third
story
of
a
noble
stone
-
edifice
,
built
in
the
form
of
the
Greek
Pi
,
the
upper
part
fronting
the
river
Arno
,
and
one
of
the
legs
adjoining
to
the
ducal
-
palace
,
where
the
courts
of
justice
are
held
.
<EOS>
As
the
house
of
Medici
had
for
some
centuries
resided
in
the
palace
of
Pitti
,
situated
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
,
a
full
mile
from
these
tribunals
,
the
architect
Vasari
,
who
planned
the
new
edifice
,
at
the
same
time
contrived
a
corridore
,
or
covered
passage
,
extending
from
the
palace
of
Pitti
along
one
of
the
bridges
,
to
the
gallery
of
curiosities
,
through
which
the
grand-
duke
passed
unseen
,
when
he
was
disposed
either
to
amuse
himself
with
his
antiquities
,
or
to
assist
at
his
courts
of
judicature
:
but
there
is
nothing
very
extraordinary
either
in
the
contrivance
or
execution
of
this
corridore
.
  
<EOS>
If
I
resided
in
Florence
I
would
give
something
extraordinary
for
permission
to
walk
every
day
in
the
gallery
,
which
I
should
much
prefer
to
the
Lycaeum
,
the
groves
of
Academus
,
or
any
porch
or
philosophical
alley
in
Athens
or
in
Rome
.
<EOS>
Here
by
viewing
the
statues
and
busts
ranged
on
each
side
,
I
should
become
acquainted
with
the
faces
of
all
the
remarkable
personages
,
male
and
female
,
of
antiquity
,
and
even
be
able
to
trace
their
different
characters
from
the
expression
of
their
features
.
<EOS>
This
collection
is
a
most
excellent
commentary
upon
the
Roman
historians
,
particularly
Suetonius
and
Dion
Cassius
.
<EOS>
There
was
one
circumstance
that
struck
me
in
viewing
the
busts
of
Caracalla
,
both
here
and
in
the
Capitol
at
Rome
;
there
was
a
certain
ferocity
in
the
eyes
,
which
seemed
to
contradict
the
sweetness
of
the
other
features
,
and
remarkably
justified
the
epithet
Caracuyl
,
by
which
he
was
distinguished
by
the
antient
inhabitants
of
North
-
Britain
.
<EOS>
In
the
language
of
the
Highlanders
caracuyl
signifies
cruel
eye
,
as
we
are
given
to
understand
by
the
ingenious
editor
of
Fingal
,
who
seems
to
think
that
Caracalla
is
no
other
than
the
Celtic
word
,
adapted
to
the
pronunciation
of
the
Romans
:
but
the
truth
is
,
Caracalla
was
the
name
of
a
Gaulish
vestment
,
which
this
prince
affected
to
wear
;
and
hence
he
derived
that
surname
.
<EOS>
The
Caracuyl
of
the
Britons
,
is
the
same
as
the
upodra
idon
of
the
Greeks
,
which
Homer
has
so
often
applied
to
his
Scolding
Heroes
.
<EOS>
I
like
the
Bacchanalian
,
chiefly
for
the
fine
drapery
.
<EOS>
The
wind
,
occasioned
by
her
motion
,
seems
to
have
swelled
and
raised
it
from
the
parts
of
the
body
which
it
covers
.
<EOS>
There
is
another
gay
Bacchanalian
,
in
the
attitude
of
dancing
,
crowned
with
ivy
,
holding
in
her
right
hand
a
bunch
of
grapes
,
and
in
her
left
the
thyrsus
.
<EOS>
The
head
of
the
celebrated
Flora
is
very
beautiful
:
the
groupe
of
Cupid
and
Psyche
,
however
,
did
not
give
me
all
the
pleasure
I
expected
from
it
.
  
<EOS>
Of
all
the
marbles
that
appear
in
the
open
gallery
,
the
following
are
those
I
most
admire
.
<EOS>
Leda
with
the
Swan
;
as
for
Jupiter
,
in
this
transformation
,
he
has
much
the
appearance
of
a
goose
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
seen
any
thing
tamer
;
but
the
sculptor
has
admirably
shewn
his
art
in
representing
Leda
's
hand
partly
hid
among
the
feathers
,
which
are
so
lightly
touched
off
,
that
the
very
shape
of
the
fingers
are
seen
underneath
.
<EOS>
The
statue
of
a
youth
,
supposed
to
be
Ganymede
,
is
compared
by
the
connoisseurs
to
the
celebrated
Venus
,
and
as
far
as
I
can
judge
,
not
without
reason
:
it
is
however
,
rather
agreeable
than
striking
,
and
will
please
a
connoisseur
much
more
than
a
common
spectator
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
whether
it
is
my
regard
to
the
faculty
that
inhances
the
value
of
the
noted
Aesculapius
,
who
appears
with
a
venerable
beard
of
delicate
workmanship
.
<EOS>
He
is
larger
than
the
life
,
cloathed
in
a
magnificent
pallium
,
his
left
arm
resting
on
a
knotted
staff
,
round
which
the
snake
is
twined
according
to
Ovid
.
  
<EOS>
Hunc
modo
serpentem
baculum
qui
nexibus
ambit
Perspice
    
Behold
the
snake
<EOS>
his
mystic
Rod
intwine
.
  
<EOS>
He
has
in
his
hand
the
fascia
herbarum
,
and
the
crepidae
on
his
feet
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
wild
-
boar
represented
lying
on
one
side
,
which
I
admire
as
a
master
-
piece
.
<EOS>
The
savageness
of
his
appearance
is
finely
contrasted
with
the
case
and
indolence
of
the
attitude
.
<EOS>
Were
I
to
meet
with
a
living
boar
lying
with
the
same
expression
,
I
should
be
tempted
to
stroke
his
bristles
.
<EOS>
Here
is
an
elegant
bust
of
Antinous
,
the
favourite
of
Adrian
;
and
a
beautiful
head
of
Alexander
the
Great
,
turned
on
one
side
,
with
an
expression
of
languishment
and
anxiety
in
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
The
virtuosi
are
not
agreed
about
the
circumstance
in
which
he
is
represented
;
whether
fainting
with
the
loss
of
blood
which
he
suffered
in
his
adventure
at
Oxydrace
;
or
languishing
with
the
fever
contracted
by
bathing
in
the
Cydnus
;
or
finally
complaining
to
his
father
Jove
,
that
there
were
no
other
worlds
for
him
to
conquer
.
<EOS>
The
kneeling
Narcissus
is
a
striking
figure
,
and
the
expression
admirable
.
<EOS>
The
two
Bacchi
are
perfectly
well
executed
;
but
(
to
my
shame
be
it
spoken
)
<EOS>
I
prefer
to
the
antique
that
which
is
the
work
of
Michael
Angelo
Buonaroti
,
concerning
which
the
story
is
told
which
you
well
know
.
<EOS>
The
artist
having
been
blamed
by
some
pretended
connoisseurs
,
for
not
imitating
the
manner
of
the
ancients
,
is
said
to
have
privately
finished
this
Bacchus
,
and
buried
it
,
after
having
broke
off
an
arm
,
which
he
kept
as
a
voucher
.
<EOS>
The
statue
,
being
dug
up
by
accident
,
was
allowed
by
the
best
judges
,
to
be
a
perfect
antique
;
upon
which
Buonaroti
produced
the
arm
,
and
claimed
his
own
work
.
<EOS>
Bianchi
looks
upon
this
as
a
fable
;
but
owns
that
Vasari
tells
such
another
of
a
child
cut
in
marble
by
the
same
artist
,
which
being
carried
to
Rome
,
and
kept
for
some
time
under
ground
,
was
dug
up
as
an
antique
,
and
sold
for
a
great
deal
of
money
.
<EOS>
I
was
likewise
attracted
by
the
Morpheus
in
touchstone
,
which
is
described
by
Addison
,
who
,
by
the
bye
,
notwithstanding
all
his
taste
,
has
been
convicted
by
Bianchi
of
several
gross
blunders
in
his
account
of
this
gallery
.
  
<EOS>
With
respect
to
the
famous
Venus
Pontia
,
commonly
called
de
Medicis
,
which
was
found
at
Tivoli
,
and
is
kept
in
a
separate
apartment
called
the
Tribuna
<EOS>
,
I
believe
I
ought
to
be
intirely
silent
,
or
at
least
conceal
my
real
sentiments
,
which
will
otherwise
appear
equally
absurd
and
presumptuous
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
want
of
taste
that
prevents
my
feeling
that
enthusiastic
admiration
with
which
others
are
inspired
at
sight
of
this
statue
:
a
statue
which
in
reputation
equals
that
of
Cupid
by
Praxiteles
,
which
brought
such
a
concourse
of
strangers
of
old
to
the
little
town
of
Thespiae
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
thinking
that
there
is
no
beauty
in
the
features
of
Venus
;
and
that
the
attitude
is
aukward
and
out
of
character
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
bad
plea
to
urge
that
the
antients
and
we
differ
in
the
ideas
of
beauty
.
<EOS>
We
know
the
contrary
,
from
their
medals
,
busts
,
and
historians
.
<EOS>
Without
all
doubt
,
the
limbs
and
proportions
of
this
statue
are
elegantly
formed
,
and
accurately
designed
,
according
to
the
nicest
rules
of
symmetry
and
proportion
;
and
the
back
parts
especially
are
executed
so
happily
,
as
to
excite
the
admiration
of
the
most
indifferent
spectator
.
<EOS>
One
can
not
help
thinking
it
is
the
very
Venus
of
Cnidos
by
Praxiteles
,
which
Lucian
describes
.
"
<EOS>
Hercle
quanta
dorsi
concinnitas
!
<EOS>
ut
<EOS>
exuberantes
lumbi
amplexantes
manus
implent
!
<EOS>
quam
scite
circumductae
clunium
pulpae
in
se
rotundantur
,
neque
tenues
nimis
<EOS>
ipsis
ossibus
adstrictae
,
neque
in
immensam
effusae
Pinguedinem
!
"
<EOS>
That
the
statue
thus
described
was
not
the
Venus
de
Medicis
,
would
appear
from
the
Greek
inscription
on
the
base
,
KLEOMENIS
APPOLLODOROI
ATHINAIOS
EPOESEI
.
<EOS>
Cleomenes
filius
Apollodori
fecit
;
did
we
not
know
that
this
inscription
is
counted
spurious
,
and
that
instead
of
EPOESEI
,
it
should
be
EPOIESE
.
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
is
but
a
frivolous
objection
,
as
we
have
seen
many
inscriptions
undoubtedly
antique
,
in
which
the
orthography
is
false
,
either
from
the
ignorance
or
carelessness
of
the
sculptor
.
<EOS>
Others
suppose
,
not
without
reason
,
that
this
statue
is
a
representation
of
the
famous
Phryne
,
the
courtesan
of
Athens
,
who
at
the
celebration
of
the
Eleusinian
games
,
exhibited
herself
coming
out
of
the
bath
,
naked
,
to
the
eyes
of
the
whole
Athenian
people
.
<EOS>
I
was
much
pleased
with
the
dancing
faun
;
and
still
better
with
the
Lotti
,
or
wrestlers
,
the
attitudes
of
which
are
beautifully
contrived
to
shew
the
different
turns
of
the
limbs
,
and
the
swelling
of
the
muscles
:
but
<EOS>
,
what
pleased
me
best
of
all
the
statues
in
the
Tribuna
was
the
Arrotino
,
commonly
called
the
Whetter
,
and
generally
supposed
to
represent
a
slave
,
who
in
the
act
of
whetting
a
knife
,
overhears
the
conspiracy
of
Catiline
.
<EOS>
You
know
he
is
represented
on
one
knee
;
and
certain
it
is
,
I
never
saw
such
an
expression
of
anxious
attention
,
as
appears
in
his
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
is
not
mingled
with
any
marks
of
surprise
,
such
as
could
not
fail
to
lay
hold
on
a
man
who
overhears
by
accident
a
conspiracy
against
the
state
.
<EOS>
The
marquis
de
Maffei
has
justly
observed
that
Sallust
,
in
his
very
circumstantial
detail
of
that
conspiracy
,
makes
no
mention
of
any
such
discovery
.
<EOS>
Neither
does
it
appear
that
the
figure
is
in
the
act
of
whetting
,
the
stone
which
he
holds
in
one
hand
being
rough
and
unequal
no
ways
resembling
a
whetstone
.
<EOS>
Others
alledge
it
represents
Milico
,
the
freedman
of
Scaevinus
,
who
conspired
against
the
life
of
Nero
,
and
gave
his
poignard
to
be
whetted
to
Milico
,
who
presented
it
to
the
emperor
,
with
an
account
of
the
conspiracy
:
but
the
attitude
and
expression
<EOS>
will
by
no
means
admit
of
this
interpretation
.
<EOS>
Bianchi
,
[
This
antiquarian
is
now
imprisoned
for
Life
,
for
having
robbed
the
Gallery
and
then
set
it
on
fire
.
]
<EOS>
who
shows
the
gallery
,
thinks
the
statue
represents
the
augur
Attius
Navius
,
who
cut
a
stone
with
a
knife
,
at
the
command
of
Tarquinius
Priscus
.
<EOS>
This
conjecture
seems
to
be
confirmed
by
a
medallion
of
Antoninus
Pius
,
inserted
by
Vaillant
among
his
Numismata
Prestantiora
,
on
which
is
delineated
nearly
such
a
figure
as
this
in
question
,
with
the
following
legend
.
"
<EOS>
Attius
Navius
genuflexus
ante
Tarquinium
Priscum
cotem
cultro
discidit
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
owns
indeed
that
in
the
statue
,
the
augur
is
not
distinguished
either
by
his
habit
or
emblems
;
and
he
might
have
added
,
neither
is
the
stone
a
cotes
.
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
think
neither
of
these
three
opinions
is
satisfactory
,
though
the
last
is
very
ingenious
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
figure
allude
to
a
private
incident
,
which
never
was
recorded
in
any
history
.
<EOS>
Among
the
great
number
of
pictures
in
this
Tribuna
,
I
was
most
charmed
with
the
Venus
by
Titian
,
which
has
a
sweetness
of
expression
and
tenderness
of
colouring
,
not
to
be
described
.
<EOS>
In
this
apartment
,
they
reckon
three
hundred
pieces
,
the
greatest
part
by
the
best
masters
,
particularly
by
Raphael
,
in
the
three
manners
by
which
he
distinguished
himself
at
different
periods
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
celebrated
statue
of
the
hermaphrodite
,
which
we
find
in
another
room
,
I
give
the
sculptor
credit
for
his
ingenuity
in
mingling
the
sexes
in
the
composition
;
but
it
is
,
at
best
,
no
other
than
a
monster
in
nature
,
which
I
never
had
any
pleasure
in
viewing
:
nor
,
indeed
,
do
I
think
there
was
much
talent
required
in
representing
a

with
the
head
and
breasts
of
a

and
all
the
other
parts
of
the

masculine

There
is
such
a
profusion
of
curiosities
in
this
celebrated
musaeum
;
statues
,
busts
,
pictures
,
medals
,
tables
inlaid
in
the
way
of
marquetry
,
<EOS>
cabinets
adorned
with
precious
stones
,
jewels
of
all
sorts
,
mathematical
instruments
,
antient
arms
and
military
machines
,
that
the
imagination
is
bewildered
,
and
a
stranger
of
a
visionary
turn
,
would
be
apt
to
fancy
himself
in
a
palace
of
the
fairies
,
raised
and
adorned
by
the
power
of
inchantment
.
  
<EOS>
In
one
of
the
detached
apartments
,
I
saw
the
antependium
of
the
altar
,
designed
for
the
famous
chapel
of
St
Lorenzo
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
curious
piece
of
architecture
,
inlaid
with
coloured
marble
and
precious
stones
,
so
as
to
represent
an
infinite
variety
of
natural
objects
.
<EOS>
It
is
adorned
with
some
crystal
pillars
,
with
capitals
of
beaten
gold
.
<EOS>
The
second
story
of
the
building
is
occupied
by
a
great
number
of
artists
employed
in
this
very
curious
work
of
marquetry
,
representing
figures
with
gems
and
different
kinds
of
coloured
marble
,
for
the
use
of
the
emperor
.
<EOS>
The
Italians
call
it
pietre
commesse
,
a
sort
of
inlaying
with
stones
,
analogous
to
the
fineering
of
cabinets
in
wood
.
<EOS>
It
is
peculiar
to
Florence
,
and
seems
to
be
still
more
curious
than
the
Mosaic
work
,
which
the
Romans
have
brought
to
great
perfection
.
  
<EOS>
The
cathedral
of
Florence
is
a
great
Gothic
building
,
encrusted
on
the
outside
with
marble
;
it
is
remarkable
for
nothing
but
its
cupola
,
which
is
said
to
have
been
copied
by
the
architect
of
St
Peter
's
at
Rome
,
and
for
its
size
,
which
is
much
greater
than
that
of
any
other
church
in
Christendom
.
 
<EOS>
[
In
this
cathedral
is
the
Tomb
of
Johannes
<EOS>
Acutus
Anglus
,
which
a
man
would
naturally
interpret
as
John
Sharp
;
but
his
name
was
really
Hawkwood
,
which
the
Italians
have
corrupted
into
Acut
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
celebrated
General
or
Condottiere
who
arrived
in
Italy
at
the
head
of
four
thousand
soldiers
of
fortune
,
mostly
Englishmen
who
had
served
with
him
in
the
army
of
King
Edward
III
,
and
were
dismissed
at
the
Peace
of
Bontigny
.
<EOS>
Hawkwood
greatly
distinguished
himself
in
Italy
by
his
valour
and
conduct
,
and
died
a
very
old
man
in
the
Florentine
service
.
<EOS>
He
was
the
son
of
a
Tanner
in
Essex
,
and
had
been
put
apprentice
to
a
Taylor
.

<EOS>
The
baptistery
,
which
stands
by
it
,
was
an
antient
temple
,
said
to
be
dedicated
to
Mars
.
<EOS>
There
are
some
good
statues
of
marble
within
;
and
one
or
two
of
bronze
on
the
outside
of
the
doors
;
but
it
is
chiefly
celebrated
for
the
embossed
work
of
its
brass
gates
,
by
Lorenzo
Ghiberti
,
which
Buonaroti
used
to
say
,
deserved
to
be
made
the
gates
of
Paradise
.
<EOS>
I
viewed
them
with
pleasure
:
<EOS>
but
still
I
retained
a
greater
veneration
for
those
of
Pisa
,
which
I
had
first
admired
:
a
preference
which
either
arises
from
want
of
taste
,
or
from
the
charm
of
novelty
,
by
which
the
former
were
recommended
to
my
attention
.
<EOS>
Those
who
would
have
a
particular
detail
of
every
thing
worth
seeing
at
Florence
,
comprehending
churches
,
libraries
,
palaces
,
tombs
,
statues
,
pictures
,
fountains
,
bridge
,
etc
.
may
consult
Keysler
,
who
is
so
laboriously
circumstantial
in
his
descriptions
,
that
I
never
could
peruse
them
,
without
suffering
the
headache
,
and
recollecting
the
old
observation
,
that
the
German
genius
lies
more
in
the
back
than
in
the
brain
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
much
disappointed
in
the
chapel
of
St
Lorenzo
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
great
profusion
of
granite
,
porphyry
,
jasper
,
verde
antico
,
lapis
-
lazuli
,
and
other
precious
stones
,
representing
figures
in
the
way
of
marquetry
,
I
think
the
whole
has
a
gloomy
effect
.
<EOS>
These
pietre
commesse
are
better
calculated
for
cabinets
,
than
for
ornaments
to
great
buildings
,
which
ought
to
be
large
masses
proportioned
to
the
greatness
of
the
edifice
.
<EOS>
The
compartments
are
so
small
,
that
they
produce
no
effect
in
giving
the
first
impression
when
one
enters
the
place
;
except
to
give
an
air
of
littleness
to
the
whole
,
just
as
if
a
grand
saloon
was
covered
with
pictures
painted
in
miniature
.
<EOS>
If
they
have
as
little
regard
to
proportion
and
perspective
,
when
they
paint
the
dome
,
which
is
not
yet
finished
,
this
chapel
will
,
in
my
opinion
,
remain
a
monument
of
ill
taste
and
extravagance
.
  
<EOS>
The
court
of
the
palace
of
Pitti
is
formed
by
three
sides
of
an
elegant
square
,
with
arcades
all
round
,
like
the
palace
of
Holyrood
house
at
Edinburgh
;
and
the
rustic
work
,
which
constitutes
the
lower
part
of
the
building
,
gives
it
an
air
of
strength
and
magnificence
.
<EOS>
In
this
court
,
there
is
a
fine
fountain
,
in
which
the
water
trickles
down
from
above
;
and
here
is
also
an
admirable
antique
statue
of
Hercules
,
inscribed
LUSIPPOI
ERGON
,
the
work
of
Lysippus
.
  
<EOS>
The
apartments
of
this
palace
are
generally
small
,
and
many
of
them
dark
.
<EOS>
Among
the
paintings
the
most
remarkable
is
the
Madonna
de
la
Seggiola
,
by
Raphael
,
counted
one
of
the
best
coloured
pieces
of
that
great
master
.
<EOS>
If
I
was
allowed
to
find
fault
with
the
performance
,
I
should
pronounce
it
defective
in
dignity
and
sentiment
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
expression
of
a
peasant
rather
than
of
the
mother
of
God
.
<EOS>
She
exhibits
the
fondness
and
joy
of
a
young
woman
towards
her
firstborn
son
,
without
that
rapture
of
admiration
which
we
expect
to
find
in
the
Virgin
Mary
,
while
she
contemplates
,
in
the
fruit
of
her
own
womb
,
the
Saviour
of
mankind
.
<EOS>
In
other
respects
,
it
is
a
fine
figure
,
gay
,
agreeable
,
and
very
expressive
of
maternal
tenderness
;
and
the
bambino
is
extremely
beautiful
.
<EOS>
There
was
an
English
painter
employed
in
copying
this
picture
,
and
what
he
had
done
was
executed
with
great
success
.
<EOS>
I
am
one
of
those
who
think
it
very
possible
to
imitate
the
best
pieces
in
such
a
manner
,
that
even
the
connoisseurs
shall
not
be
able
to
distinguish
the
original
from
the
copy
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
I
do
not
set
up
for
a
judge
in
these
matters
,
and
very
likely
I
may
incur
the
ridicule
of
the
virtuosi
for
the
remarks
I
have
made
:
but
I
am
used
to
speak
my
mind
freely
on
all
subjects
that
fall
under
the
cognizance
of
my
senses
;
though
I
must
as
freely
own
,
there
is
something
more
than
common
sense
required
to
discover
and
distinguish
the
more
delicate
beauties
of
painting
.
<EOS>
I
can
safely
say
,
however
,
that
without
any
daubing
at
all
,
I
am
,
very
sincerely
 
Your
affectionate
humble
servant

<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
<EOS>
Having
seen
all
the
curiosities
of
Florence
,
and
hired
a
good
travelling
coach
for
seven
weeks
,
at
the
price
of
seven
zequines
,
something
less
than
three
guineas
and
a
half
,
we
set
out
post
for
Rome
,
by
the
way
of
Sienna
,
where
we
lay
the
first
night
.
<EOS>
The
country
through
which
we
passed
is
mountainous
but
agreeable
.
<EOS>
Of
Sienna
I
can
say
nothing
from
my
own
observation
,
but
that
we
were
indifferently
lodged
in
a
house
that
stunk
like
a
privy
,
and
fared
wretchedly
at
supper
.
<EOS>
The
city
is
large
and
well
built
:
the
inhabitants
pique
themselves
upon
their
politeness
,
and
the
purity
of
their
dialect
.
<EOS>
Certain
it
is
,
some
strangers
reside
in
this
place
on
purpose
to
learn
the
best
pronunciation
of
the
Italian
tongue
.
<EOS>
The
Mosaic
pavement
of
their
duomo
,
or
cathedral
,
has
been
much
admired
;
as
well
as
the
history
of
Aeneas
Sylvius
,
afterwards
pope
Pius
II
,
painted
on
the
walls
of
the
library
,
partly
by
Pietro
Perugino
,
and
partly
by
his
pupil
Raphael
D'Urbino
.
  
<EOS>
Next
day
,
at
Buon
Convento
,
where
the
emperor
Henry
VII
was
poisoned
by
a
friar
with
the
sacramental
wafer
,
I
refused
to
give
money
to
the
hostler
,
who
in
revenge
put
two
young
unbroke
stone
-
horses
in
the
traces
next
to
the
coach
,
which
became
so
unruly
,
that
before
we
had
gone
a
quarter
of
a
mile
,
they
and
the
postilion
were
rolling
in
the
dust
.
<EOS>
In
this
situation
they
made
such
efforts
to
disengage
themselves
,
and
kicked
with
such
violence
,
that
I
imagined
the
carriage
and
all
our
trunks
would
have
been
beaten
in
pieces
.
<EOS>
We
leaped
out
of
the
coach
,
however
,
without
sustaining
any
personal
damage
,
except
the
fright
;
nor
was
any
hurt
done
to
the
vehicle
.
<EOS>
But
the
horses
were
terribly
bruised
,
and
almost
strangled
,
before
they
could
be
disengaged
.
<EOS>
Exasperated
at
the
villany
of
the
hostler
,
I
resolved
to
make
a
complaint
to
the
uffiziale
or
magistrate
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
I
found
him
wrapped
in
an
old
,
greasy
,
ragged
,
great
-
coat
,
sitting
in
a
wretched
apartment
,
without
either
glass
,
paper
,
or
boards
in
the
windows
;
and
there
was
no
sort
of
furniture
but
a
couple
of
broken
chairs
and
a
miserable
truckle
-
bed
.
<EOS>
He
looked
pale
,
and
meagre
,
and
had
more
the
air
of
a
half
-
starved
prisoner
than
of
a
magistrate
.
<EOS>
Having
heard
my
complaint
,
he
came
forth
into
a
kind
of
outward
room
or
bellfrey
,
and
rung
a
great
bell
with
his
own
hand
.
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
this
signal
,
the
postmaster
came
up
stairs
,
and
I
suppose
he
was
the
first
man
in
the
place
,
for
the
uffiziale
stood
before
him
cap
-
in
-
hand
,
and
with
great
marks
of
humble
respect
repeated
the
complaint
I
had
made
.
<EOS>
This
man
assured
me
,
with
an
air
of
conscious
importance
,
that
he
himself
had
ordered
the
hostler
to
supply
me
with
those
very
horses
,
which
were
the
best
in
his
stable
;
and
that
the
misfortune
which
happened
was
owing
to
the
misconduct
of
the
fore
-
postilion
,
who
did
not
keep
the
fore
-
horses
to
a
proper
speed
proportioned
to
the
mettle
of
the
other
two
.
<EOS>
As
he
took
the
affair
upon
himself
,
and
I
perceived
had
an
ascendancy
over
the
magistrate
,
I
contented
myself
with
saying
,
I
was
certain
the
two
horses
had
been
put
to
the
coach
on
purpose
,
either
to
hurt
or
frighten
us
;
and
that
since
I
could
not
have
justice
here
I
would
make
a
formal
complaint
to
the
British
minister
at
Florence
.
<EOS>
In
passing
through
the
street
to
the
coach
,
which
was
by
this
time
furnished
with
fresh
horses
,
I
met
the
hostler
,
and
would
have
caned
him
heartily
;
but
perceiving
my
intention
,
he
took
to
his
heels
and
vanished
.
<EOS>
Of
all
the
people
I
have
ever
seen
,
the
hostlers
,
postilions
,
and
other
fellows
hanging
about
the
post
-
houses
in
Italy
,
are
the
most
greedy
,
impertinent
,
and
provoking
.
<EOS>
Happy
are
those
travellers
who
have
phlegm
enough
to
disregard
their
insolence
and
importunity
:
for
this
is
not
so
disagreeable
as
their
revenge
is
dangerous
.
<EOS>
An
English
gentleman
at
Florence
told
me
,
that
one
of
those
fellows
,
whom
he
had
struck
for
his
impertinence
,
flew
at
him
with
a
long
knife
,
and
he
could
hardly
keep
him
at
sword
's
point
.
<EOS>
All
of
them
wear
such
knives
,
and
are
very
apt
to
use
them
on
the
slightest
provocation
.
<EOS>
But
their
open
attacks
are
not
so
formidable
as
their
premeditated
schemes
of
revenge
;
in
the
prosecution
of
which
the
Italians
are
equally
treacherous
and
cruel
.
  
<EOS>
This
night
we
passed
at
a
place
called
Radicofani
,
a
village
and
fort
,
situated
on
the
top
of
a
very
high
mountain
.
<EOS>
The
inn
stands
still
lower
than
the
town
.
<EOS>
It
was
built
at
the
expence
of
the
last
grand
-
duke
of
Tuscany
;
is
very
large
,
very
cold
,
and
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
One
would
imagine
it
was
contrived
for
coolness
,
though
situated
so
high
,
that
even
in
the
midst
of
summer
,
a
traveller
would
be
glad
to
have
a
fire
in
his
chamber
.
<EOS>
But
few
,
or
none
of
them
have
fireplaces
,
and
there
is
not
a
bed
with
curtains
or
tester
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
All
the
adjacent
country
is
naked
and
barren
.
<EOS>
On
the
third
day
we
entered
the
pope
's
territories
,
some
parts
of
which
are
delightful
.
<EOS>
Having
passed
Aqua
-
Pendente
,
a
beggarly
town
,
situated
on
the
top
of
a
rock
,
from
whence
there
is
a
romantic
cascade
of
water
,
which
gives
it
the
name
,
we
travelled
along
the
side
of
the
lake
Bolsena
,
a
beautiful
piece
of
water
about
thirty
miles
in
circuit
,
with
two
islands
in
the
middle
,
the
banks
covered
with
noble
plantations
of
oak
and
cypress
.
<EOS>
The
town
of
Bolsena
standing
near
the
ruins
of
the
antient
Volsinium
,
which
was
the
birth
-
place
of
Sejanus
,
is
a
paultry
village
;
and
Montefiascone
,
famous
for
its
wine
,
is
a
poor
,
decayed
town
in
this
neighbourhood
,
situated
on
the
side
of
a
hill
,
which
,
according
to
the
author
of
the
Grand
Tour
,
the
only
directory
I
had
along
with
me
,
is
supposed
to
be
the
Soracte
of
the
ancients
.
<EOS>
If
we
may
believe
Horace
,
Soracte
was
visible
from
Rome
:
for
,
in
his
ninth
ode
,
addressed
to
Thaliarchus
,
he
says
,
  
Vides
,
ut
alta
stet
nive
candidum
<EOS>
Soracte
    
<EOS>
You
see
how
deeply
wreathed
with
snow
Soracte
lifts
his
hoary
head
,
  
but
,
in
order
to
see
Montefiascone
,
his
eyesight
must
have
penetrated
through
the
Mons
Cyminus
,
at
the
foot
of
which
now
stands
the
city
of
Viterbo
.
<EOS>
Pliny
tells
us
,
that
Soracte
was
not
far
from
Rome
,
haud
procul
ab
urbe
Roma
;
but
Montefiascone
is
fifty
miles
from
this
city
.
<EOS>
And
Desprez
,
in
his
notes
upon
Horace
,
says
it
is
now
called
Monte
S
Oreste
.
<EOS>
Addison
tells
us
he
passed
by
it
in
the
Campania
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
without
indignation
reflect
upon
the
bigotry
of
Mathilda
,
who
gave
this
fine
country
to
the
see
of
Rome
,
under
the
dominion
of
which
no
country
was
ever
known
to
prosper
.
  
<EOS>
About
half
way
between
Montefiascone
and
Viterbo
,
one
of
our
fore
-
wheels
flew
off
,
together
with
a
large
splinter
of
the
axle
-
tree
;
and
if
one
of
the
postilions
had
not
by
great
accident
been
a
remarkably
ingenious
fellow
,
we
should
have
been
put
to
the
greatest
inconvenience
,
as
there
was
no
town
,
or
even
house
,
within
several
miles
.
<EOS>
I
mention
this
circumstance
,
by
way
of
warning
to
other
travellers
,
that
they
may
provide
themselves
with
a
hammer
and
nails
,
a
spare
iron
-
pin
or
two
,
a
large
knife
,
and
bladder
of
grease
,
to
be
used
occasionally
in
case
of
such
misfortune
.
  
<EOS>
The
mountain
of
Viterbo
is
covered
with
beautiful
plantations
and
villas
belonging
to
the
Roman
nobility
,
who
come
hither
to
make
the
villegiatura
in
summer
.
<EOS>
Of
the
city
of
Viterbo
<EOS>
I
shall
say
nothing
,
but
that
it
is
the
capital
of
that
country
which
Mathilda
gave
to
the
Roman
see
.
<EOS>
The
place
is
well
built
,
adorned
with
public
fountains
,
and
a
great
number
of
churches
and
convents
;
yet
far
from
being
populous
,
the
whole
number
of
inhabitants
,
not
exceeding
fifteen
thousand
.
<EOS>
The
post
-
house
is
one
of
the
worst
inns
I
ever
entered
.
  
<EOS>
After
having
passed
this
mountain
,
the
Cyminus
of
the
antients
,
we
skirted
part
of
the
lake
,
which
is
now
called
de
Vico
,
and
whose
banks
afford
the
most
agreeable
rural
prospects
of
hill
and
vale
,
wood
,
glade
and
water
,
shade
and
sun
-
shine
.
<EOS>
A
few
other
very
inconsiderable
places
we
passed
,
and
descended
into
the
Campania
of
Rome
,
which
is
almost
a
desert
.
<EOS>
The
view
of
this
country
in
its
present
situation
,
can
not
but
produce
emotions
of
pity
and
indignation
in
the
mind
of
every
person
who
retains
any
idea
of
its
antient
cultivation
and
fertility
.
<EOS>
It
is
nothing
but
a
naked
withered
down
,
desolate
and
dreary
,
almost
without
inclosure
,
corn
-
field
,
hedge
,
tree
,
shrub
,
house
,
hut
,
or
habitation
;
exhibiting
here
and
there
the
ruins
of
an
antient
castellum
,
tomb
,
or
temple
,
and
in
some
places
the
remains
of
a
Roman
via
.
<EOS>
I
had
heard
much
of
these
antient
pavements
,
and
was
greatly
disappointed
when
I
saw
them
.
<EOS>
The
Via
Cassia
or
Cymina
is
paved
with
broad
,
solid
,
flint
-
stones
,
which
must
have
greatly
incommoded
the
feet
of
horses
that
travelled
upon
it
as
well
as
endangered
the
lives
of
the
riders
from
the
slipperiness
of
the
pavement
:
besides
,
it
is
so
narrow
that
two
modern
carriages
could
not
pass
one
another
upon
it
,
without
the
most
imminent
hazard
of
being
overturned
.
<EOS>
I
am
still
of
opinion
that
we
excel
the
ancient
Romans
in
understanding
the
conveniences
of
life
.
  
<EOS>
The
Grand
Tour
says
,
that
within
four
miles
of
Rome
you
see
a
tomb
on
the
roadside
,
said
to
be
that
of
Nero
,
with
sculpture
in
basso
-
relievo
at
both
ends
.
<EOS>
I
did
see
such
a
thing
more
like
a
common
grave
-
stone
,
than
the
tomb
of
an
emperor
.
<EOS>
But
we
are
informed
by
Suetonius
,
that
the
dead
body
of
Nero
,
who
slew
himself
at
the
villa
of
his
freedman
,
was
by
the
care
of
his
two
nurses
and
his
concubine
Atta
,
removed
to
the
sepulchre
of
the
Gens
Domitia
,
immediately
within
the
Porta
del
Popolo
,
on
your
left
hand
as
you
enter
Rome
,
precisely
on
the
spot
where
now
stands
the
church
of
S
Maria
del
Popolo
.
<EOS>
His
tomb
was
even
distinguished
by
an
epitaph
,
which
has
been
preserved
by
Gruterus
.
<EOS>
Giacomo
Alberici
tells
us
very
gravely
in
his
History
of
the
Church
,
that
a
great
number
of
devils
,
who
guarded
the
bones
of
this
wicked
emperor
,
took
possession
,
in
the
shape
of
black
ravens
,
of
a
walnut
-
tree
,
which
grew
upon
the
spot
;
from
whence
they
insulted
every
passenger
,
until
pope
Paschal
II
,
in
consequence
of
a
solemn
fast
and
a
revelation
,
went
thither
in
procession
with
his
court
and
cardinals
,
cut
down
the
tree
,
and
burned
it
to
ashes
,
which
,
with
the
bones
of
Nero
,
were
thrown
into
the
Tyber
:
then
he
consecrated
an
altar
on
the
place
,
where
afterwards
the
church
was
built
.
<EOS>
You
may
guess
what
I
felt
at
first
sight
of
the
city
of
Rome
,
which
,
notwithstanding
all
the
calamities
it
has
undergone
,
still
maintains
an
august
and
imperial
appearance
.
<EOS>
It
stands
on
the
farther
side
of
the
Tyber
,
which
we
crossed
at
the
Ponte
Molle
,
formerly
called
Pons
Milvius
,
about
two
miles
from
the
gate
by
which
we
entered
.
<EOS>
This
bridge
was
built
by
Aemilius
Censor
,
whose
name
it
originally
bore
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
road
by
which
so
many
heroes
returned
with
conquest
to
their
country
;
by
which
so
many
kings
were
led
captive
to
Rome
;
and
by
which
the
ambassadors
of
so
many
kingdoms
and
states
approached
the
seat
of
empire
,
to
deprecate
the
wrath
,
to
sollicit
the
friendship
,
or
sue
for
the
protection
of
the
Roman
people
.
<EOS>
It
is
likewise
famous
for
the
defeat
and
death
of
Maxentius
,
who
was
here
overcome
by
Constantine
the
Great
.
<EOS>
The
space
between
the
bridge
and
Porta
del
Popolo
,
on
the
right
-
hand
,
which
is
now
taken
up
with
gardens
and
villas
,
was
part
of
the
antient
Campus
Martius
,
where
the
comitiae
were
held
;
and
where
the
Roman
people
inured
themselves
to
all
manner
of
exercises
:
it
was
adorned
with
porticos
,
temples
,
theatres
,
baths
,
circi
,
basilicae
,
obelisks
,
columns
,
statues
,
and
groves
.
<EOS>
Authors
differ
in
their
opinions
about
the
extent
of
it
;
but
as
they
all
agree
that
it
contained
the
Pantheon
,
the
Circus
Agonis
,
now
the
Piazza
Navona
,
the
Bustum
and
Mausoleum
Augusti
,
great
part
of
the
modern
city
must
be
built
upon
the
ancient
Campus
Martius
.
<EOS>
The
highway
that
leads
from
the
bridge
to
the
city
,
is
part
of
the
Via
Flaminia
,
which
extended
as
far
as
Rimini
;
and
is
well
paved
,
like
a
modern
street
.
<EOS>
Nothing
of
the
antient
bridge
remains
but
the
piles
;
nor
is
there
any
thing
in
the
structure
of
this
,
or
of
the
other
five
Roman
bridges
over
the
Tyber
,
that
deserves
attention
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
seen
any
bridge
in
France
or
Italy
,
comparable
to
that
of
Westminster
either
in
beauty
,
magnificence
,
or
solidity
;
and
when
the
bridge
at
Black
-
Friars
is
finished
,
it
will
be
such
a
monument
of
architecture
as
all
the
world
can
not
parallel
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
Tyber
,
it
is
,
in
comparison
with
the
Thames
,
no
more
than
an
inconsiderable
stream
,
foul
,
deep
,
and
rapid
.
<EOS>
It
is
navigable
by
small
boats
,
barks
,
and
lighters
;
and
,
for
the
conveniency
of
loading
and
unloading
them
,
there
is
a
handsome
quay
by
the
new
custom
-
house
,
at
the
Porto
di
Ripetta
,
provided
with
stairs
of
each
side
,
and
adorned
with
an
elegant
fountain
,
that
yields
abundance
of
excellent
water
.
  
<EOS>
We
are
told
that
the
bed
of
this
river
has
been
considerably
raised
by
the
rubbish
of
old
Rome
,
and
this
is
the
reason
usually
given
for
its
being
so
apt
to
overflow
its
banks
.
<EOS>
A
citizen
of
Rome
told
me
,
that
a
friend
of
his
lately
digging
to
lay
the
foundation
of
a
new
house
in
the
lower
part
of
the
city
,
near
the
bank
of
the
river
,
discovered
the
pavement
of
an
antient
street
,
at
the
depth
of
thirty
-
nine
feet
from
the
present
surface
of
the
earth
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
concluded
that
modern
Rome
is
near
forty
feet
higher
in
this
place
,
than
the
site
of
the
antient
city
,
and
that
the
bed
of
the
river
is
raised
in
proportion
;
but
this
is
altogether
incredible
.
<EOS>
Had
the
bed
of
the
Tyber
been
antiently
forty
feet
lower
at
Rome
,
than
it
is
at
present
,
there
must
have
been
a
fall
or
cataract
in
it
immediately
above
this
tract
,
as
it
is
not
pretended
that
the
bed
of
it
is
raised
in
any
part
above
the
city
;
otherwise
such
an
elevation
would
have
obstructed
its
course
,
and
then
it
would
have
overflowed
the
whole
Campania
.
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
extraordinary
in
its
present
overflowings
:
they
frequently
happened
of
old
,
and
did
great
mischief
to
the
antient
city
.
<EOS>
Appian
,
Dio
,
and
other
historians
,
describe
an
inundation
of
the
Tiber
immediately
after
the
death
of
Julius
Caesar
,
which
inundation
was
occasioned
by
the
sudden
melting
of
a
great
quantity
of
snow
upon
the
Apennines
.
<EOS>
This
calamity
is
recorded
by
Horace
in
his
ode

The
Porta
del
Popolo
(
formerly
,
Flaminia

)
by
which
we
entered
Rome
,
is
an
elegant
piece
of
architecture
,
adorned
with
marble
columns
and
statues
,
executed
after
the
design
of
Buonaroti
.
<EOS>
Within
-
side
you
find
yourself
in
a
noble
piazza
,
from
whence
three
of
the
principal
streets
of
Rome
are
detached
.
<EOS>
It
is
adorned
with
the
famous
Aegyptian
obelisk
,
brought
hither
from
the
Circus
Maximus
,
and
set
up
by
the
architect
Dominico
Fontana
in
the
pontificate
of
Sixtus
V
Here
<EOS>
is
likewise
a
beautiful
fountain
designed
by
the
same
artist
;
and
at
the
beginning
of
the
two
principal
streets
,
are
two
very
elegant
churches
fronting
each
other
.
<EOS>
Such
an
august
entrance
can
not
fail
to
impress
a
stranger
with
a
sublime
idea
of
this
venerable
city
.
  
<EOS>
Having
given
our
names
at
the
gate
,
we
repaired
to
the
dogana
,
or
custom
-
house
,
where
our
trunks
and
carriage
were
searched
;
and
here
we
were
surrounded
by
a
number
of
servitori
de
piazza
,
offering
their
services
with
the
most
disagreeable
importunity
.
<EOS>
Though
I
told
them
several
times
I
had
no
occasion
for
any
,
three
of
them
took
possession
of
the
coach
,
one
mounting
before
and
two
of
them
behind
;
and
thus
we
proceeded
to
the
Piazza
d'Espagna
,
where
the
person
lived
to
whose
house
I
was
directed
.
<EOS>
Strangers
that
come
to
Rome
seldom
put
up
at
public
inns
,
but
go
directly
to
lodging
houses
,
of
which
there
is
great
plenty
in
this
quarter
.
<EOS>
The
Piazza
d'Espagna
is
open
,
airy
,
and
pleasantly
situated
in
a
high
part
of
the
city
immediately
under
the
Colla
Pinciana
,
and
adorned
with
two
fine
fountains
.
<EOS>
Here
most
of
the
English
reside
:
the
apartments
are
generally
commodious
and
well
furnished
;
and
the
lodgers
are
well
supplied
with
provisions
and
all
necessaries
of
life
.
<EOS>
But
,
if
I
studied
oeconomy
,
I
would
choose
another
part
of
the
town
than
the
Piazza
d'Espagna
,
which
is
,
besides
,
at
a
great
distance
from
the
antiquities
.
<EOS>
For
a
decent
first
floor
and
two
bed
-
chambers
on
the
second
,
I
payed
no
more
than
a
scudo
(
five
shillings
)
per
day
.
<EOS>
Our
table
was
plentifully
furnished
by
the
landlord
for
two
and
thirty
pauls
,
being
equal
to
sixteen
shillings
.
<EOS>
I
hired
a
town
-
coach
at
the
rate
of
fourteen
pauls
,
or
seven
shillings
a
day
;
and
a
servitore
di
piazza
for
three
pauls
,
or
eighteen
-
pence
.
<EOS>
The
coachman
has
also
an
allowance
of
two
pauls
a
day
.
<EOS>
The
provisions
at
Rome
are
reasonable
and
good
,
the
vitella
mongana
,
however
,
which
is
the
most
delicate
veal
I
ever
tasted
,
is
very
dear
,
being
sold
for
two
pauls
,
or
a
shilling
,
the
pound
.
<EOS>
Here
are
the
rich
wines
of
Montepulciano
,
 
Montefiascone
,
and
Monte
di
Dragone
;
but
what
we
commonly
drink
at
meals
is
that
of
Orvieto
,
a
small
white
wine
,
of
an
agreeable
flavour
.
<EOS>
Strangers
are
generally
advised
to
employ
an
antiquarian
to
instruct
them
in
all
the
curiosities
of
Rome
;
and
this
is
a
necessary
expence
,
when
a
person
wants
to
become
a
connoisseur
in
painting
,
statuary
,
and
architecture
.
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
I
had
no
such
ambition
.
<EOS>
I
longed
to
view
the
remains
of
antiquity
by
which
this
metropolis
is
distinguished
;
and
to
contemplate
the
originals
of
many
pictures
and
statues
,
which
I
had
admired
in
prints
and
descriptions
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
chose
a
servant
,
who
was
recommended
to
me
as
a
sober
,
intelligent
fellow
,
acquainted
with
these
matters
:
at
the
same
time
I
furnished
myself
with
maps
and
plans
of
antient
and
modern
Rome
,
together
with
the
little
manual
,
called
,
Itinerario
istruttivo
per
ritrovare
con
facilita
tutte
le
magnificenze
di
Roma
e
di
alcune
citta
'
,
e
castelli
suburbani
.
<EOS>
But
I
found
still
more
satisfaction
in
perusing
the
book
in
three
volumes
,
intitled
,
Roma
antica
,
e
moderna
,
which
contains
a
description
of
everything
remarkable

This
directory
cost
me
a
zequine
;
but
a
hundred
zequines
will
not
purchase
all
the
books
and
prints
which
have
been
published
at
Rome
on
these
subjects
.
<EOS>
Of
these
the
most
celebrated
are
the
plates
of
Piranesi
,
who
is
not
only
an
ingenious
architect
and
engraver
,
but
also
a
learned
antiquarian
;
though
he
is
apt
to
run
riot
in
his
conjectures
;
and
with
regard
to
the
arts
of
antient
Rome
,
has
broached
some
doctrines
,
which
he
will
find
it
very
difficult
to
maintain
.
<EOS>
Our
young
gentlemen
who
go
to
Rome
will
do
well
to
be
upon
their
guard
against
a
set
of
sharpers
,
(
some
of
them
of
our
own
country
,
)
who
deal
in
pictures
and
antiques
,
and
very
often
impose
upon
the
uninformed
stranger
,
by
selling
him
trash
,
as
the
productions
of
the
most
celebrated
artists
.
<EOS>
The
English
are
more
than
any
other
foreigners
exposed
to
this
imposition
.
<EOS>
They
are
supposed
to
have
more
money
to
throw
away
;
and
therefore
a
greater
number
of
snares
are
laid
for
them
.
<EOS>
This
opinion
of
their
superior
wealth
<EOS>
they
take
a
pride
in
confirming
,
by
launching
out
into
all
manner
of
unnecessary
expence
:
<EOS>
but
,
what
is
still
more
dangerous
,
the
moment
they
set
foot
in
Italy
,
they
are
seized
with
the
ambition
of
becoming
connoisseurs
in
painting
,
musick
,
statuary
,
and
architecture
;
and
the
adventurers
of
this
country
do
not
fail
to
flatter
this
weakness
for
their
own
advantage
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
in
different
parts
of
Italy
,
a
number
of
raw
boys
,
whom
Britain
seemed
to
have
poured
forth
on
purpose
to
bring
her
national
character
into
contempt
,
ignorant
,
petulant
,
rash
,
and
profligate
,
without
any
knowledge
or
experience
of
their
own
,
without
any
director
to
improve
their
understanding
,
or
superintend
their
conduct
.
<EOS>
One
engages
in
play
with
an
infamous
gamester
,
and
is
stripped
perhaps
in
the
very
first
partie
:
another
is
pillaged
by
an
antiquated
cantatrice
;
a
third
is
bubbled
by
a
knavish
antiquarian
;
and
a
fourth
is
laid
under
contribution
by
a
dealer
in
pictures
.
<EOS>
Some
turn
fiddlers
,
and
pretend
to
compose
:
but
all
of
them
talk
familiarly
of
the
arts
,
and
return
finished
connoisseurs
and
coxcombs
,
to
their
own
country
.
<EOS>
The
most
remarkable
phaenomenon
of
this
kind
,
which
I
have
seen
,
is
a
boy
of
seventy
-
two
,
now
actually
travelling
through
Italy
,
for
improvement
,
under
the
auspices
of
another
boy
of
twenty

When
you
arrive
at
Rome
,
you
receive
cards
from
all
your
country
-
folks
in
that
city
:
they
expect
to
have
the
visit
returned
next
day
,
when
they
give
orders
not
to
be
at
home
;
and
you
never
speak
to
one
another
in
the
sequel
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
refinement
in
hospitality
and
politeness
,
which
the
English
have
invented
by
the
strength
of
their
own
genius
,
without
any
assistance
either
from
France
,
Italy
,
or
Lapland
.
<EOS>
No
Englishman
above
the
degree
of
a
painter
or
cicerone
frequents
any
coffee
-
house
at
Rome
;
and
as
there
are
no
public
diversions
,
except
in
carnival
-
time
,
the
only
chance
you
have
of
seeing
your
compatriots
is
either
in
visiting
the
curiosities
,
or
at
a
conversazione
.
<EOS>
The
Italians
are
very
scrupulous
in
admitting
foreigners
,
except
those
who
are
introduced
as
people
of
quality
:
but
if
there
happens
to
be
any
English
lady
of
fashion
at
Rome
,
she
generally
keeps
an
assembly
,
to
which
the
British
subjects
resort
.
<EOS>
In
my
next

I
shall
communicate
,
without
ceremony
or
affectation
,
what
further
remarks
I
have
made
at
Rome
,
without
any
pretence
,
however
,
to
the
character
of
a
connoisseur

which
,
without

would
fit
very
aukwardly

DEAR
SIR
,
 
<EOS>
Nothing
can
be
more
agreeable
to
the
eyes
of
a
stranger
,
especially
in
the
heats
of
summer
,
than
the
great
number
of
public
fountains
that
appear
in
every
part
of
Rome
,
embellished
with
all
the
ornaments
of
sculpture
,
and
pouring
forth
prodigious
quantities
of
cool
,
delicious
water
,
brought
in
aqueducts
from
different
lakes
,
rivers
,
and
sources
,
at
a
considerable
distance
from
the
city
.
<EOS>
These
works
are
the
remains
of
the
munificence
and
industry
of
the
antient
Romans
,
who
were
extremely
delicate
in
the
article
of
water
:
<EOS>
but
,
however
,
great
applause
is
also
due
to
those
beneficent
popes
who
have
been
at
the
expence
of
restoring
and
repairing
those
noble
channels
of
health
,
pleasure
,
and
convenience
.
<EOS>
This
great
plenty
of
water
,
nevertheless
,
has
not
induced
the
Romans
to
be
cleanly
.
<EOS>
Their
streets
,
and
even
their
palaces
,
are
disgraced
with
filth
.
<EOS>
The
noble
Piazza
Navona
,
is
adorned
with
three
or
four
fountains
,
one
of
which
is
perhaps
the
most
magnificent
in
Europe
,
and
all
of
them
discharge
vast
streams
of
water
:
but
,
notwithstanding
this
provision
,
the
piazza
is
almost
as
dirty
,
as
West
Smithfield
,
where
the
cattle
are
sold
in
London
.
<EOS>
The
corridores
,
arcades
,
and
even
staircases
of
their
most
elegant
palaces
,
are
depositories
of
nastiness
,
and
indeed
in
summer
smell
as
strong
as
spirit
of
hartshorn
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
great
notion
that
their
ancestors
were
not
much
more
cleanly
.
<EOS>
If
we
consider
that
the
city
and
suburbs
of
Rome
,
in
the
reign
of
Claudius
,
contained
about
seven
millions
of
inhabitants
,
a
number
equal
at
least
to
the
sum
total
of
all
the
souls
in
England
;
that
great
part
of
antient
<EOS>
Rome
was
allotted
to
temples
,
porticos
,
basilicae
,
theatres
,
thermae
,
circi
,
public
and
private
walks
and
gardens
,
where
very
few
,
if
any
,
of
this
great
number
lodged
;
that
by
far
the
greater
part
of
those
inhabitants
were
slaves
and
poor
people
,
who
did
not
enjoy
the
conveniencies
of
life
;
and
that
the
use
of
linen
was
scarce
known
;
we
must
naturally
conclude
they
were
strangely
crouded
together
,
and
that
in
general
they
were
a
very
frowzy
generation
.
<EOS>
That
they
were
crouded
together
appears
from
the
height
of
their
houses
,
which
the
poet
Rutilius
compared
to
towers
made
for
scaling
heaven
.
<EOS>
In
order
to
remedy
this
inconvenience
,
Augustus
Caesar
published
a
decree
,
that
for
the
future
no
houses
should
be
built
above
seventy
feet
high
,
which
,
at
a
moderate
computation
,
might
make
six
stories
.
<EOS>
But
what
seems
to
prove
,
beyond
all
dispute
,
that
the
antient
Romans
were
dirty
creatures
,
are
these
two
particulars
.
<EOS>
Vespasian
laid
a
tax
upon
urine
and
ordure
,
on
pretence
of
being
at
a
great
expence
in
clearing
the
streets
from
such
nuisances
;
an
imposition
which
amounted
to
about
fourteen
pence
a
year
for
every
individual
;
and
when
Heliogabalus
ordered
all
the
cobwebs
of
the
city
and
suburbs
to
be
collected
,
they
were
found
to
weigh
ten
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
This
was
intended
as
a
demonstration
of
the
great
number
of
inhabitants
;
but
it
was
a
proof
of
their
dirt
,
rather
than
of
their
populosity
.
<EOS>
I
might
likewise
add
,
the
delicate
custom
of
taking
vomits
at
each
other
's
houses
,
when
they
were
invited
to
dinner
,
or
supper
,
that
they
might
prepare
their
stomachs
for
gormandizing
;
a
beastly
proof
of
their
nastiness
as
well
as
gluttony
.
<EOS>
Horace
,
in
his
description
of
the
banquet
of
Nasiedenus
,
says
,
when
the
canopy
,
under
which
they
sat
,
fell
down
,
it
brought
along
with
it
as
much
dirt
as
is
raised
by
a
hard
gale
of
wind
in
dry
weather
.
                  
<EOS>
trahentia

Quantum
non

<EOS>
Campanis

<EOS>
Such
clouds
of
dust
revolving
in
its
train
<EOS>
As
Boreas
whirls
along
the
level
plain
.
  
<EOS>
I
might
observe
,
that
the
streets
were
often
encumbered
with
the
putrefying
carcasses
of
criminals
,
who
had
been
dragged
through
them
by
the
heels
,
and
precipitated
from
the
Scalae
Gemoniae
,
or
Tarpeian
rock
,
before
they
were
thrown
into
the
Tyber
,
which
was
the
general
receptacle
of
the
cloaca
maxima
and
all
the
filth
of
Rome
:
besides
,
the
bodies
of
all
those
who
made
away
with
themselves
,
without
sufficient
cause
;
of
such
as
were
condemned
for
sacrilege
,
or
killed
by
thunder
,
were
left
unburned
and
unburied
,
to
rot
above
ground
.
  
<EOS>
I
believe
the
moderns
retain
more
of
the
customs
of
antient
Romans
,
than
is
generally
imagined
.
<EOS>
When
I
first
saw
the
infants
at
the
enfans
trouves
in
Paris
,
so
swathed
with
bandages
,
that
the
very
sight
of
them
made
my
eyes
water
,
I
little
dreamed
,
that
the
prescription
of
the
antients
could
be
pleaded
for
this
custom
,
equally
shocking
and
absurd
:
<EOS>
but
in
the
Capitol
at
Rome
,
I
met
with
the
antique
statue
of
a
child
swaddled
exactly
in
the
same
manner
;
rolled
up
like
an
Aegyptian
mummy
from
the
feet
.
<EOS>
The
circulation
of
the
blood
,
in
such
a
case
,
must
be
obstructed
on
the
whole
surface
of
the
body
;
and
nothing
be
at
liberty
but
the
head
,
which
is
the
only
part
of
the
child
that
ought
to
be
confined
.
<EOS>
Is
it
not
surprising
that
common
sense
should
not
point
out
,
even
to
the
most
ignorant
,
that
those
accursed
bandages
must
heat
the
tender
infant
into
a
fever
;
must
hinder
the
action
of
the
muscles
,
and
the
play
of
the
joints
,
so
necessary
to
health
and
nutrition
;
and
that
while
the
refluent
blood
is
obstructed
in
the
veins
,
which
run
on
the
surface
of
the
body
,
the
arteries
,
which
lie
deep
,
without
the
reach
of
compression
,
are
continually
pouring
their
contents
into
the
head
,
where
the
blood
meets
with
no
resistance
?
<EOS>
The
vessels
of
the
brain
are
naturally
lax
,
and
the
very
sutures
of
the
skull
are
yet
unclosed
.
<EOS>
What
are
the
consequences
of
this
cruel
swaddling
?
<EOS>
the
limbs
are
wasted
;
the
joints
grow
rickety
;
the
brain
is
compressed
,
and
a
hydrocephalus
,
with
a
great
head
and
sore
eyes
,
ensues
.
<EOS>
I
take
this
abominable
practice
to
be
one
great
cause
of
the
bandy
legs
,
diminutive
bodies
,
and
large
heads
,
<EOS>
so
frequent
in
the
south
of
France
,
and
in
Italy
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
no
less
surprised
to
find
the
modern
fashion
of
curling
the
hair
,
borrowed
in
a
great
measure
from
the
coxcombs
and
coquettes
of
antiquity
.
<EOS>
I
saw
a
bust
of
Nero
in
the
gallery
at
Florence
,
the
hair
represented
in
rows
of
buckles
,
like
that
of
a
French
petit
-
maitre
,
conformable
to
the
picture
drawn
of
him
by
Suetonius
.
<EOS>
Circa

So
very
finical
in
his
dress
<EOS>
,
that
he
wore
his
hair
in
the
Greek
fashion
,
curled
in
rows
almost
to
the
crown
of
his
head
.
<EOS>
I
was
very
sorry
however
to
find
that
this
foppery
came
from
Greece
.
<EOS>
As
for
Otho
,
he
wore
a
galericulum
,
or
tour
,
on
account
of
thin
hair
,
propter
raritatem
capillorum
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
right
to
imitate
the
example
of
Julius
Caesar
,
who
concealed
his
bald
head
with
a
wreath
of
laurel
.
<EOS>
But
there
is
a
bust
in
the
Capitol
of
Julia
Pia
,
the
second
wife
of
Septimius
Severus
,
with
a
moveable
peruke
,
dressed
exactly
in
the
fashionable
mode
,
with
this
difference
,
that
there
is
no
part
of
it
frizzled
;
nor
is
there
any
appearance
of
pomatum
and
powder
.
<EOS>
These
improvements
the
beau
-
monde
have
borrowed
from
the
natives
of
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope
.
  
<EOS>
Modern
Rome
does
not
cover
more
than
one
-
third
of
the
space
within
the
walls
;
and
those
parts
that
were
most
frequented
of
old
are
now
intirely
abandoned
.
<EOS>
From
the
Capitol
to
the
Coliseo
,
including
the
Forum
Romanum
and
Boarium
,
there
is
nothing
intire
<EOS>
but
one
or
two
churches
,
built
with
the
fragments
of
ancient
edifices
.
<EOS>
You
descend
from
the
Capitol
between
the
remaining
pillars
of
two
temples
,
the
pedestals
and
part
of
the
shafts
sunk
in
the
rubbish
:
then
passing
through
the
triumphal
arch
of
Septimius
Severus
,
you
proceed
along
the
foot
of
Mons
Palatinus
,
which
stands
on
your
right
hand
,
quite
covered
with
the
ruins
of
the
antient
palace
belonging
to
the
Roman
emperors
,
and
at
the
foot
of
it
,
there
are
some
beautiful
detached
pillars
still
standing
.
<EOS>
On
the
left
you
see
the
remains
of
the
Templum
Pacis
,
which
seems
to
have
been
the
largest
and
most
magnificent
of
all
the
temples
in
Rome
.
<EOS>
It
was
built
and
dedicated
by
the
emperor
Vespasian
,
who
brought
into
it
all
the
treasure
and
precious
vessels
which
he
found
in
the
temple
of
Jerusalem
.
<EOS>
The
columns
of
the
portico
he
removed
from
Nero
's
golden
house
,
which
he
levelled
with
the
ground
.
<EOS>
This
temple
was
likewise
famous
for
its
library
,
mentioned
by
Aulus
Gellius
,
Further
on
,
is
the
arch
of
Constantine
on
the
right
,
a
most
noble
piece
of
architecture
,
almost
entire
;
with
the
remains
of
the
Meta
Sudans
before
it
;
and
fronting
you
,
the
noble
ruins
of
that
vast
amphitheatre
,
called
the
Colossaeum
,
now
Coliseo
,
which
has
been
dismantled
and
dilapidated
by
the
Gothic
popes
and
princes
of
modern
Rome
,
to
build
and
adorn
their
paultry
palaces
.
<EOS>
Behind
the
amphitheatre
were
the
thermae
of
the
same
emperor
Titus
Vespasian
.
<EOS>
In
the
same
quarter
was
the
Circus
Maximus
;
and
the
whole
space
from
hence
on
both
sides
,
to
the
walls
of
Rome
,
comprehending
above
twice
as
much
ground
as
the
modern
city
,
is
almost
covered
with
the
monuments
of
antiquity
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
there
is
more
concealed
below
ground
than
appears
above
.
<EOS>
The
miserable
houses
,
and
even
garden
-
walls
of
the
peasants
in
this
district
,
are
built
with
these
precious
materials
.
<EOS>
I
mean
shafts
and
capitals
of
marble
columns
,
heads
,
arms
,
legs
,
and
mutilated
trunks
of
statues
.
<EOS>
What
pity
it
is
that
among
all
the
remains
of
antiquity
,
at
Rome
,
there
is
not
one
lodging
-
house
remaining
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
glad
to
know
how
the
senators
of
Rome
were
lodged
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
be
better
informed
touching
the
cava
aedium
,
the
focus
,
the
ara
deorum
penatum
,
the
conclavia
,
triclinia
,
and
caenationes
;
the
atria
where
the
women
resided
,
and
employed
themselves
in
the
woolen
manufacture
;
the
praetoria
,
which
were
so
spacious
as
to
become
a
nuisance
in
the
reign
of
Augustus
;
and
the
Xysta
,
which
were
shady
walks
between
two
porticos
,
where
the
men
exercised
themselves
in
the
winter
.
<EOS>
I
am
disgusted
by
the
modern
taste
of
architecture
,
though
I
am
no
judge
of
the
art
.
<EOS>
The
churches
and
palaces
of
these
days
are
crowded
with
pretty
ornaments
,
which
distract
the
eye
,
and
by
breaking
the
design
into
a
variety
of
little
parts
,
destroy
the
effect
of
the
whole
.
<EOS>
Every
door
and
window
has
its
separate
ornaments
,
its
moulding
,
frize
,
cornice
.
<EOS>
and
tympanum
;
then
there
is
such
an
assemblage
of
useless
festoons
,
pillars
,
pilasters
,
with
their
architraves
,
entablatures
,
and
I
know
not
what
,
that
nothing
great
or
uniform
remains
to
fill
the
view
;
and
we
in
vain
look
for
that
simplicity
of
grandeur
,
those
large
masses
of
light
and
shadow
,
and
the
inexpressible
EUSUINOPTON
,
which
characterise
the
edifices
of
the
antients
.
<EOS>
A
great
edifice
,
to
have
its
full
effect
,
ought
to
be
isole
,
or
detached
from
all
others
,
with
a
large
space
around
it
:
but
the
palaces
of
Rome
,
and
indeed
of
all
the
other
cities
of
Italy
,
which
I
have
seen
,
are
so
engaged
among
other
mean
houses
,
that
their
beauty
and
magnificence
are
in
a
great
measure
concealed
.
<EOS>
Even
those
which
face
open
streets
and
piazzas
are
only
clear
in
front
.
<EOS>
The
other
apartments
are
darkened
by
the
vicinity
of
ordinary
houses
;
and
their
views
are
confined
by
dirty
and
disagreeable
objects
.
<EOS>
Within
the
court
there
is
generally
a
noble
colonnade
all
round
,
and
an
open
corridore
above
,
but
the
stairs
are
usually
narrow
,
steep
,
and
high
,
the
want
of
sash
-
windows
,
the
dullness
of
their
small
glass
lozenges
,
the
dusty
brick
floors
,
and
the
crimson
hangings
laced
with
gold
,
contribute
to
give
a
gloomy
air
to
their
apartments
;
I
might
add
to
these
causes
,
a
number
of
Pictures
executed
on
melancholy
subjects
,
antique
mutilated
statues
,
busts
,
basso
relieves
,
urns
,
and
sepulchral
stones
,
with
which
their
rooms
are
adorned
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
owned
,
however
,
there
are
some
exceptions
to
this
general
rule
.
<EOS>
The
villa
of
cardinal
Alexander
Albani
is
light
,
gay
,
and
airy
;
yet
the
rooms
are
too
small
,
and
too
much
decorated
with
carving
and
gilding
,
which
is
a
kind
of
gingerbread
work
.
<EOS>
The
apartments
of
one
of
the
princes
Borghese
are
furnished
in
the
English
taste
;
and
in
the
palazzo
di
colonna
connestabile
,
there
is
a
saloon
,
or
gallery
,
which
,
for
the
proportions
,
lights
,
furniture
,
and
ornaments
,
is
the
most
noble
,
elegant
,
and
agreeable
apartment
I
ever
saw
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
diverting
to
hear
all
Italian
expatiate
upon
the
greatness
of
modern
Rome
.
<EOS>
He
will
tell
you
there
are
above
three
hundred
palaces
in
the
city
;
that
there
is
scarce
a
Roman
prince
,
whose
revenue
does
not
exceed
two
hundred
thousand
crowns
;
and
that
Rome
produces
not
only
the
most
learned
men
,
but
also
the
most
refined
politicians
in
the
universe
.
<EOS>
To
one
of
them
talking
in
this
strain
,
I
replied
,
that
instead
of
three
hundred
palaces
,
the
number
did
not
exceed
fourscore
;
that
I
had
been
informed
,
on
good
authority
,
there
were
not
six
individuals
in
Rome
who
had
so
much
as
forty
thousand
crowns
a
year
,
about
ten
thousand
pounds
sterling
;
and
that
to
say
their
princes
were
so
rich
,
and
their
politicians
so
refined
,
was
,
in
effect
,
a
severe
satire
upon
them
,
for
not
employing
their
wealth
and
their
talents
for
the
advantage
of
their
country
.
<EOS>
I
asked
why
their
cardinals
and
princes
did
not
invite
and
encourage
industrious
people
to
settle
and
cultivate
the
Campania
of
Rome
,
which
is
a
desert
?
<EOS>
why
they
did
not
raise
a
subscription
to
drain
the
marshes
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
city
,
and
thus
meliorate
the
air
,
which
is
rendered
extremely
unwholsome
in
the
summer
,
by
putrid
exhalations
from
those
morasses
?
<EOS>
I
demanded
of
him
,
why
they
did
not
contribute
their
wealth
,
and
exert
their
political
refinements
,
in
augmenting
their
forces
by
sea
and
land
,
for
the
defence
of
their
country
,
introducing
commerce
and
manufactures
,
and
in
giving
some
consequence
to
their
state
,
which
was
no
more
than
a
mite
in
the
political
scale
of
Europe
?
<EOS>
I
expressed
a
desire
to
know
what
became
of
all
those
sums
of
money
,
inasmuch
as
there
was
hardly
any
circulation
of
gold
and
silver
in
Rome
,
and
the
very
bankers
,
on
whom
strangers
have
their
credit
,
make
interest
to
pay
their
tradesmen
's
bills
with
paper
notes
of
the
bank
of
Spirito
Santo
?
<EOS>
And
now
I
am
upon
this
subject
,
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
observe
that
I
was
strangely
misled
by
all
the
books
consulted
about
the
current
coin
of
Italy
.
<EOS>
In
Tuscany
,
and
the
Ecclesiastical
State
,
one
sees
nothing
but
zequines
in
gold
,
and
pieces
of
two
paoli
,
one
paolo
,
and
half
a
paolo
,
in
silver
.
<EOS>
Besides
these
,
there
is
a
copper
coin
at
Rome
,
called
bajocco
and
mezzo
bajocco
.
<EOS>
Ten
bajocchi
make
a
paolo
:
ten
paoli
make
a
scudo
,
which
is
an
imaginary
piece
:
two
scudi
make
a
zequine
;
and
a
French
loui'dore
is
worth
two
zequines
and
two
paoli
.
  
<EOS>
Rome
has
nothing
to
fear
from
the
catholic
powers
,
who
respect
it
with
a
superstitious
veneration
as
the
metropolitan
seat
of
their
religion
:
but
the
popes
will
do
well
to
avoid
misunderstandings
with
the
maritime
protestant
states
,
especially
the
English
,
who
being
masters
of
the
Mediterranean
,
and
in
possession
of
Minorca
,
have
it
in
their
power
at
all
times
,
to
land
a
body
of
troops
within
four
leagues
of
Rome
,
and
to
take
the
city
,
without
opposition
.
<EOS>
Rome
is
surrounded
with
an
old
wall
,
but
altogether
incapable
of
defence
.
<EOS>
Or
if
it
was
,
the
circuit
of
the
walls
is
so
extensive
,
that
it
would
require
a
garrison
of
twenty
thousand
men
.
<EOS>
The
only
appearance
of
a
fortification
in
this
city
,
is
the
castle
of
St
Angelo
,
situated
on
the
further
bank
of
the
Tyber
,
to
which
there
is
access
by
a
handsome
bridge
:
but
this
castle
,
which
was
formerly
the
moles
Adriani
,
could
not
hold
out
half
a
day
against
a
battery
of
ten
pieces
of
cannon
properly
directed
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
expedient
left
to
the
invention
of
the
modern
Romans
,
to
convert
an
ancient
tomb
into
a
citadel
.
<EOS>
It
could
only
serve
as
a
temporary
retreat
for
the
pope
in
times
of
popular
commotion
,
and
on
other
sudden
emergencies
;
as
it
happened
in
the
case
of
pope
Clement
VII
when
the
troops
of
the
emperor
took
the
city
by
assault
;
and
this
only
,
while
he
resided
at
the
Vatican
,
from
whence
there
is
a
covered
gallery
continued
to
the
castle
:
it
can
never
serve
this
purpose
again
,
while
the
pontiff
lives
on
Monte
Cavallo
,
which
is
at
the
other
end
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
The
castle
of
St
Angelo
,
howsoever
ridiculous
as
a
fortress
,
appears
respectable
as
a
noble
monument
of
antiquity
,
and
though
standing
in
a
low
situation
,
is
one
of
the
first
objects
that
strike
the
eye
of
a
stranger
approaching
Rome
.
<EOS>
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
,
are
the
wretched
remains
of
the
Mausoleum
Augusti
,
which
was
still
more
magnificent
.
<EOS>
Part
of
the
walls
is
standing
,
and
the
terraces
are
converted
into
garden
-
ground
.
<EOS>
In
viewing
these
ruins
,
I
remembered
Virgil
's
pathetic
description
of
Marcellus
,
who
was
here
intombed
.
  
<EOS>
Quantos

Along

<EOS>

The
beautiful
poem
of
Ovid

written
after
the
ashes
of
Augustus
and
his
nephew
Marcellus
,
of
Germanicus
,
Agrippa
,
and
Drusus
,
were
deposited
in
this
mausoleum
,
concludes
with
these
lines
,
which
are
extremely
tender
:
  
<EOS>
Claudite

Claudite

Ah

yawning
Tombs

Too

unclos'd

dreary

What
the
author
said
of
the
monument
,
you
will
be
tempted
to
say
of
this
letter
,
which
I

<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
In
my
last
I
gave
you
my
opinion
freely
of
the
modern
palaces
of
Italy
.
<EOS>
I
shall
now
hazard
my
thoughts
upon
the
gardens
of
this
country
,
which
the
inhabitants
extol
with
all
the
hyperboles
of
admiration
and
applause
.
<EOS>
I
must
acknowledge
however
<EOS>
,
I
have
not
seen
the
famous
villas
at
Frascati
and
Tivoli
,
which
are
celebrated
for
their
gardens
and
waterworks
.
<EOS>
I
intended
to
visit
these
places
;
but
was
prevented
by
an
unexpected
change
of
weather
,
which
deterred
me
from
going
to
the
country
.
<EOS>
On
the
last
day
of
September
the
mountains
of
Palestrina
were
covered
with
snow
;
and
the
air
became
so
cold
at
Rome
,
that
I
was
forced
to
put
on
my
winter
cloaths
.
<EOS>
This
objection
continued
,
till
I
found
it
necessary
to
set
out
on
my
return
to
Florence
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
seen
the
gardens
of
the
Poggio
Imperiale
,
and
the
Palazzo
de
Pitti
at
Florence
,
and
those
of
the
Vatican
,
of
the
pope
's
palace
on
Monte
Cavallo
,
of
the
Villa
Ludovisia
,
Medicea
,
and
Pinciana
,
at
Rome
;
so
that
I
think
I
have
some
right
to
judge
of
the
Italian
taste
in
gardening
.
<EOS>
Among
those
I
have
mentioned
,
that
of
the
Villa
Pinciana
,
is
the
most
remarkable
,
and
the
most
extensive
,
including
a
space
of
three
miles
in
circuit
,
hard
by
the
walls
of
Rome
,
containing
a
variety
of
situations
high
and
low
,
which
favour
all
the
natural
embellishments
one
would
expect
to
meet
with
in
a
garden
,
and
exhibit
a
diversity
of
noble
views
of
the
city
and
adjacent
country
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
fine
extensive
garden
or
park
,
an
Englishman
expects
to
see
a
number
of
groves
and
glades
,
intermixed
with
an
agreeable
negligence
,
which
seems
to
be
the
effect
of
nature
and
accident
.
<EOS>
He
looks
for
shady
walks
encrusted
with
gravel
;
for
open
lawns
covered
with
verdure
as
smooth
as
velvet
,
but
much
more
lively
and
agreeable
;
for
ponds
,
canals
,
basins
,
cascades
,
and
running
streams
of
water
;
for
clumps
of
trees
,
woods
,
and
wildernesses
,
cut
into
delightful
alleys
,
perfumed
with
honeysuckle
and
sweet-
briar
,
and
resounding
with
the
mingled
melody
of
all
the
singing
birds
of
heaven
:
he
looks
for
plats
of
flowers
in
different
parts
to
refresh
the
sense
,
and
please
the
fancy
;
for
arbours
,
grottos
,
hermitages
,
temples
,
and
alcoves
,
to
shelter
him
from
the
sun
,
and
afford
him
means
of
contemplation
and
repose
;
and
he
expects
to
find
the
hedges
,
groves
,
and
walks
,
and
lawns
kept
with
the
utmost
order
and
propriety
.
<EOS>
He
who
loves
the
beauties
of
simple
nature
,
and
the
charms
of
neatness
will
seek
for
them
in
vain
amidst
the
groves
of
Italy
.
<EOS>
In
the
garden
of
the
Villa
Pinciana
,
there
is
a
plantation
of
four
hundred
pines
,
which
the
Italians
view
with
rapture
and
admiration
:
there
is
likewise
a
long
walk
,
of
trees
extending
from
the
garden
-
gate
to
the
palace
;
and
plenty
of
shade
,
with
alleys
and
hedges
in
different
parts
of
the
ground
:
but
the
groves
are
neglected
;
the
walks
are
laid
with
nothing
but
common
mould
or
sand
,
black
and
dusty
;
the
hedges
are
tall
,
thin
and
shabby
;
the
trees
stunted
;
the
open
ground
,
brown
and
parched
,
has
scarce
any
appearance
of
verdure
.
<EOS>
The
flat
,
regular
alleys
of
evergreens
are
cut
into
fantastic
figures
;
the
flower
gardens
embellished
with
thin
cyphers
and
flourished
figures
in
box
,
while
the
flowers
grow
in
rows
of
earthen
-
pots
,
and
the
ground
appears
as
dusky
as
if
it
was
covered
with
the
cinders
of
a
blacksmith
's
forge
.
<EOS>
The
water
,
of
which
there
is
great
plenty
,
instead
of
being
collected
in
large
pieces
,
or
conveyed
in
little
rivulets
and
streams
to
refresh
the
thirsty
soil
,
or
managed
so
as
to
form
agreeable
cascades
,
is
squirted
from
fountains
in
different
parts
of
the
garden
,
through
tubes
little
bigger
than
common
glyster
-
pipes
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
owned
indeed
that
the
fountains
have
their
merit
in
the
way
of
sculpture
and
architecture
;
and
that
here
is
a
great
number
of
statues
which
merit
attention
:
but
they
serve
only
to
encumber
the
ground
,
and
destroy
that
effect
of
rural
simplicity
,
which
our
gardens
are
designed
to
produce
.
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
here
we
see
a
variety
of
walks
and
groves
and
fountains
,
a
wood
of
four
hundred
pines
,
a
paddock
with
a
few
meagre
deer
,
a
flower
-
garden
,
an
aviary
,
a
grotto
,
and
a
fish
-
pond
;
and
in
spite
of
all
these
particulars
,
it
is
,
in
my
opinion
,
a
very
contemptible
garden
,
when
compared
to
that
of
Stowe
in
Buckinghamshire
,
or
even
to
those
of
Kensington
and
Richmond
.
<EOS>
The
Italians
understand
,
because
they

This
Villa
Pinciana
,
which
belongs
to
the
Borghese
family
,
would
make
a
complete
academy
for
painting
and
sculpture
,
especially
for
the
study
of
antient
marbles
;
for
,
exclusive
of
the
statues
and
busts
in
the
garden
,
and
the
vast
collection
in
the
different
apartments
,
almost
the
whole
outside
of
the
house
is
covered
with
curious
pieces
in
basso
and
alto
relievo
.
<EOS>
The
most
masterly
is
that
of
Curtius
on
horseback
,
leaping
into
the
gulph
or
opening
of
the
earth
,
which
is
said
to
have
closed
on
receiving
this
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
Among
the
exhibitions
of
art
within
the
house
,
I
was
much
struck
with
a
Bacchus
,
and
the
death
of
Meleager
,
represented
on
an
antient
sepulchre
.
<EOS>
There
is
also
an
admirable
statue
of
Silenus
,
with
the
infant
Bacchus
in
his
arms
;
a
most
beautiful
gladiator
;
a
curious
Moor
of
black
marble
,
with
a
shirt
of
white
alabaster
;
a
finely
proportioned
bull
of
black
marble
also
,
standing
upon
a
table
of
alabaster
;
a
black
gipsey
with
a
head
,
hands
,
and
feet
of
brass
;
and
the
famous
hermaphrodite
,
which
vies
with
that
of
Florence
:
though
the
most
curious
circumstance
of
this
article
,
is
the
mattrass
executed
and
placed
by
Bernini
,
with
such
art
and
dexterity
,
that
to
the
view
,
it
rivals
the
softness
of
wool
,
and
seems
to
retain
the
marks
of
pressure
,
according
to
the
figure
of
the
superincumbent
statue
.
<EOS>
Let
us
likewise
own
,
for
the
honour
of
the
moderns
,
that
the
same
artist
has
produced
two
fine
statues
,
which
we
find
among
the
ornaments
of
this
villa
,
namely
,
a
David
with
his
sling
in
the
attitude
of
throwing
the
stone
at
the
giant
Goliah
;
and
a
Daphne
changing
into
laurel
at
the
approach
of
Apollo
.
<EOS>
On
the
base
of
this
figure
,
are
the
two
following
elegant
lines
,
written
by
pope
Urban
VIII
in
his
younger
years
.
  
<EOS>
Quisquis

Who

fleeting
Beauty
,
vain
pursuit

<EOS>
Shall
barren
Leaves
obtain

or
bitter
fruit

<EOS>
I
ought
not
to
forget
two
exquisite
antique
statues
of
Venus
,
the
weeping
slave
,
and
the
youth
pulling
a
thorn
out
of
his
foot
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
pretend
to
give
a
methodical
detail
of
the
curiosities
of
Rome
:
they
have
been
already
described
by
different
authors
,
who
were
much
better
qualified
than
I
am
for
the
talk
:
but
you
shall
have
what
observations
I
made
on
the
most
remarkable
objects
,
without
method
,
just
as
they
occur
to
my
remembrance
;
and
I
protest
the
remarks
are
all
my
own
:
so
that
if
they
deserve
any
commendation
,
I
claim
all
the
merit
;
and
if
they
are
impertinent
,
I
must
be
contented
to
bear
all
the
blame
.
  
<EOS>
The
piazza
of
St
Peter
's
church
is
altogether
sublime
.
<EOS>
The
double
colonnade
on
each
side
extending
in
a
semi
-
circular
sweep
,
the
stupendous
Aegyptian
obelisk
,
the
two
fountains
,
the
portico
,
and
the
admirable
facade
of
the
church
,
form
such
an
assemblage
of
magnificent
objects
,
as
can
not
fail
to
impress
the
mind
with
awe
and
admiration
:
but
the
church
would
have
produced
a
still
greater
effect
,
had
it
been
detached
entirely
from
the
buildings
of
the
Vatican
,
It
would
then
have
been
a
master
-
piece
of
architecture
,
complete
in
all
its
parts
,
intire
and
perfect
:
<EOS>
whereas
,
at
present
,
it
is
no
more
than
a
beautiful
member
attached
to
a
vast
undigested
and
irregular
pile
of
building
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
architecture
of
this
famous
temple
,
I
shall
say
nothing
;
neither
do
I
pretend
to
describe
the
internal
ornaments
.
<EOS>
The
great
picture
of
Mosaic
work
,
and
that
of
St
Peter
's
bark
tossed
by
the
tempest
,
which
appear
over
the
gate
of
the
church
,
though
rude
in
comparison
with
modern
pieces
,
are
nevertheless
great
curiosities
,
when
considered
as
the
work
of
Giotto
,
who
flourished
in
the
beginning
of
the
fourteenth
century
.
<EOS>
His
master
was
Cimabue
,
who
learned
painting
and
architecture
of
the
Grecian
artists
,
who
came
from
Constantinople
,
and
first
revived
these
arts
in
Italy
.
<EOS>
But
,
to
return
to
St
Peter
's
,
I
was
not
at
all
pleased
with
the
famous
statue
of
the
dead
Christ
in
his
mother
's
lap
,
by
Michael
Angelo
.
<EOS>
The
figure
of
Christ
is
as
much
emaciated
,
as
if
he
had
died
of
a
consumption
:
besides
,
there
is
something
indelicate
,
not
to
say
indecent
,
in
the
attitude
and
design
of
a
man
's
body
,
stark
naked
,
lying
upon
the
knees
of
a
woman
.
<EOS>
Here
are
some
good
pictures
,
I
should
rather
say
copies
of
good
pictures
,
done
in
Mosaic
to
great
perfection
;
particularly
a
St
Sebastian
by
Domenichino
,
and
Michael
the
Archangel
,
from
a
,
painting
of
Guido
Rheni
.
<EOS>
I
am
extremely
fond
of
all
this
artist
's
pieces
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
tenderness
and
delicacy
in
his
manner
;
and
his
figures
are
all
exquisitely
beautiful
,
though
his
expression
is
often
erroneous
,
and
his
attitudes
are
always
affected
and
unnatural
.
<EOS>
In
this
very
piece
the
archangel
has
all
the
air
of
a
French
dancing
-
master
;
and
I
have
seen
a
Madonna
by
the
same
hand
,
I
think
it
is
in
the
Palazzo
di
Barberini
,
in
which
,
though
the
figures
are
enchanting
,
the
Virgin
is
represented
holding
up
the
drapery
of
the
infant
,
with
the
ridiculous
affectation
of
a
singer
on
the
stage
of
our
Italian
opera
.
<EOS>
The
Mosaic
work
,
though
brought
to
a
wonderful
degree
of
improvement
,
and
admirably
calculated
for
churches
,
the
dampness
of
which
is
pernicious
to
the
colours
of
the
pallet
,
I
will
not
yet
compare
to
the
productions
of
the
pencil
.
<EOS>
The
glassyness
(
if
I
may
be
allowed
the
expression
)
of
the
surface
,
throws
,
in
my
opinion
,
a
false
light
on
some
parts
of
the
picture
;
and
when
you
approach
it
,
the
joinings
of
the
pieces
look
like
so
many
cracks
on
painted
canvas
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
this
method
is
extremely
tedious
and
expensive
.
<EOS>
I
went
to
see
the
artists
at
work
,
in
a
house
that
stands
near
the
church
,
where
I
was
much
pleased
with
the
ingenuity
of
the
process
;
and
not
a
little
surprized
at
the
great
number
of
different
colours
and
tints
,
which
are
kept
in
separate
drawers
,
marked
with
numbers
as
far
as
seventeen
thousand
.
<EOS>
For
a
single
head
done
in
Mosaic
,
they
asked
me
fifty
zequines
.
<EOS>
But
to
return
to
the
church
.
<EOS>
The
altar
of
St
Peter
's
choir
,
notwithstanding
all
the
ornaments
which
have
been
lavished
upon
it
,
is
no
more
than
a
heap
of
puerile
finery
,
better
adapted
to
an
Indian
pagod
,
than
to
a
temple
built
upon
the
principles
of
the
Greek
architecture
.
<EOS>
The
four
colossal
figures
that
support
the
chair
,
are
both
clumsy
and
disproportioned
.
<EOS>
The
drapery
of
statues
,
whether
in
brass
or
stone
,
when
thrown
into
large
masses
,
appears
hard
and
unpleasant
to
the
eye
and
for
that
reason
the
antients
always
imitated
wet
linen
,
which
exhibiting
the
shape
of
the
limbs
underneath
,
and
hanging
in
a
multiplicity
of
wet
folds
,
gives
an
air
of
lightness
,
softness
,
and
ductility
to
the
whole
.
  
<EOS>
These
two
statues
weigh
116,257
pounds
,
and
as
they
sustain
nothing
but
a
chair
,
are
out
of
all
proportion
,
inasmuch
as
the
supporters
ought
to
be
suitable
to
the
things
supported
.
<EOS>
Here
are
four
giants
holding
up
the
old
wooden
chair
of
the
apostle
<EOS>
Peter
,
if
we
may
believe
the
book
De
Identitate
Cathedrae
Romanae
,
Of
the
Identity
of
the
Roman
Chair
.
<EOS>
The
implements
of
popish
superstition
;
such
as
relicks
of
pretended
saints
,
ill
-
proportioned
spires
and
bellfreys
,
and
the
nauseous
repetition
of
the
figure
of
the
cross
,
which
is
in
itself
a
very
mean
and
disagreeable
object
,
only
fit
for
the
prisons
of
condemned
criminals
,
have
contributed
to
introduce
a
vitious
taste
into
the
external
architecture
,
as
well
as
in
the
internal
ornaments
of
our
temples
.
<EOS>
All
churches
are
built
in
the
figure
of
a
cross
,
which
effectually
prevents
the
eye
from
taking
in
the
scope
of
the
building
,
either
without
side
or
within
;
consequently
robs
the
edifice
of
its
proper
effect
.
<EOS>
The
palace
of
the
Escurial
in
Spain
is
laid
out
in
the
shape
of
a
gridiron
,
because
the
convent
was
built
in
consequence
of
a
vow
to
St
Laurence
,
who
was
broiled
like
a
barbecued
pig
.
<EOS>
What
pity
it
is
,
that
the
labours
of
painting
should
have
been
so
much
employed
on
the
shocking
subjects
of
the
martyrology
.
<EOS>
Besides
numberless
pictures
of
the
flagellation
,
crucifixion
,
and
descent
from
the
cross
,
we
have
Judith
with
the
head
of
Holofernes
,
Herodias
with
the
head
of
John
the
Baptist
,
<EOS>
Jael
assassinating
Sisera
in
his
sleep
<EOS>
,
Peter
writhing
on
the
cross
,
Stephen
battered
with
stones
,
Sebastian
stuck
full
of
arrows
,
Laurence
frying
upon
the
coals
,
Bartholomew
flaed
alive
,
and
a
hundred
other
pictures
equally
frightful
,
which
can
only
serve
to
fill
the
mind
with
gloomy
ideas
,
and
encourage
a
spirit
of
religious
fanaticism
,
which
has
always
been
attended
with
mischievous
consequences
to
the
community
where
it
reigned
.
  
<EOS>
The
tribune
of
the
great
altar
,
consisting
of
four
wreathed
brass
pillars
,
gilt
,
supporting
a
canopy
,
is
doubtless
very
magnificent
,
if
not
over
-
charged
with
sculpture
,
fluting
,
foliage
,
festoons
,
and
figures
of
boys
and
angels
,
which
,
with
the
hundred
and
twenty
-
two
lamps
of
silver
,
continually
burning
below
,
serve
rather
to
dazzle
the
eyes
,
and
kindle
the
devotion
of
the
ignorant
vulgar
,
than
to
excite
the
admiration
of
a
judicious
observer
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
,
I
believe
,
in
this
famous
structure
,
so
worthy
of
applause
,
as
the
admirable
symmetry
and
proportion
of
its
parts
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
all
the
carving
,
gilding
,
basso
relievos
,
medallions
,
urns
,
statues
,
columns
,
and
pictures
with
which
it
abounds
,
it
does
not
,
on
the
whole
,
appear
over
-
crouded
with
ornaments
.
<EOS>
When
you
first
enter
,
your
eye
is
filled
so
equally
and
regularly
,
that
nothing
appears
stupendous
;
and
the
church
seems
considerably
smaller
than
it
really
is
.
<EOS>
The
statues
of
children
,
that
support
the
founts
of
holy
water
when
observed
from
the
door
,
seem
to
be
of
the
natural
size
;
but
as
you
draw
near
,
you
perceive
they
are
gigantic
.
<EOS>
In
the
same
manner
,
the
figures
of
the
doves
,
with
olive
branches
in
their
beaks
,
which
are
represented
on
the
wall
,
appear
to
be
within
your
reach
;
but
as
you
approach
them
,
they
recede
to
a
considerable
height
,
as
if
they
had
flown
upwards
to
avoid
being
taken
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
much
disappointed
at
sight
of
the
Pantheon
,
which
,
after
all
that
has
been
said
of
it
,
looks
like
a
huge
cockpit
,
open
at
top
.
<EOS>
The
portico
which
Agrippa
added
to
the
building
,
is
undoubtedly
very
noble
,
though
,
in
my
opinion
,
it
corresponds
but
ill
with
the
simplicity
of
the
edifice
.
<EOS>
With
all
my
veneration
for
the
antients
,
I
can
not
see
in
what
the
beauty
of
tile
rotunda
consists
.
<EOS>
It
is
no
more
than
a
plain
unpierced
cylinder
,
or
circular
wall
,
with
two
fillets
and
a
cornice
,
having
a
vaulted
roof
or
cupola
,
open
in
the
centre
.
<EOS>
I
mean
the
original
building
,
without
considering
the
vestibule
of
Agrippa
.
<EOS>
Within
side
it
has
much
the
air
of
a
mausoleum
.
<EOS>
It
was
this
appearance
which
,
in
all
probability
,
suggested
the
thought
to
Boniface
IV
to
transport
hither
eight
and
twenty
cart
-
loads
of
old
rotten
bones
,
dug
from
different
burying
-
places
,
and
then
dedicate
it
as
a
church
to
the
blessed
Virgin
and
all
the
holy
martyrs
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
one
of
those
who
think
it
is
well
lighted
by
the
hole
at
the
top
,
which
is
about
nine
and
twenty
feet
in
diameter
,
although
the
author
of
the
Grand
Tour
calls
it
but
nine
.
<EOS>
The
same
author
says
,
there
is
a
descent
of
eleven
steps
to
go
into
it
;
that
it
is
a
hundred
and
forty
-
four
feet
in
heighth
,
and
as
many
in
breadth
;
that
it
was
covered
with
copper
,
which
,
with
the
brass
nails
of
the
portico
,
pope
Urban
VIII
took
away
,
and
converted
into
the
four
wreathed
pillars
that
support
the
canopy
of
the
high
altar
in
the
church
of
St
Peter
,
&
<EOS>
c.
The
truth
is
,
before
the
time
of
pope
Alexander
VII
,
the
earth
was
so
raised
as
to
cover
part
of
the
temple
,
and
there
was
a
descent
of
some
steps
into
the
porch
:
but
that
pontiff
ordered
the
ground
to
be
pared
away
to
the
very
pedestal
or
base
of
the
portico
,
which
is
now
even
with
the
street
,
so
that
there
is
no
descent
whatsoever
.
<EOS>
The
height
is
two
hundred
palmi
,
and
the
breadth
two
hundred
and
eighteen
;
which
,
reckoning
fife
palmi
at
nine
inches
,
will
bring
the
height
to
one
hundred
and
fifty
,
and
the
breadth
to
one
hundred
and
sixty
-
three
feet
six
inches
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
any
covering
of
copper
which
pope
Urban
VIII
removed
,
but
large
brass
beams
,
which
supported
the
roof
of
the
portico
.
<EOS>
They
weighed
186,392
pounds
;
and
afforded
metal
enough
not
only
for
the
pillars
in
St
Peter
's
church
,
but
also
for
several
pieces
of
artillery
that
are
now
in
the
castle
of
St
Angelo
.
<EOS>
What
is
more
extraordinary
,
the
gilding
of
those
columns
is
said
to
have
cost
forty
thousand
golden
crowns
:
sure
money
was
never
worse
laid
out
.
<EOS>
Urban
VIII
likewise
added
two
bellfrey
towers
to
the
rotunda
;
and
I
wonder
he
did
not
cover
the
central
hole
with
glass
,
as
it
must
be
very
inconvenient
and
disagreeable
to
those
who
go
to
church
below
,
to
be
exposed
to
the
rain
in
wet
weather
,
which
must
also
render
it
very
damp
and
unwholesome
.
<EOS>
I
visited
it
several
times
,
and
each
time
it
looked
more
and
more
gloomy
and
sepulchral
.
  
<EOS>
The
magnificence
of
the
Romans
was
not
so
conspicuous
in
their
temples
,
as
in
their
theatres
,
amphitheatres
,
circusses
,
naumachia
,
aqueducts
,
triumphal
arches
,
porticoes
,
basilicae
,
but
especially
their
thermae
,
or
bathing
-
places
.
<EOS>
A
great
number
of
their
temples
were
small
and
inconsiderable
;
not
one
of
them
was
comparable
either
for
size
or
magnificence
,
to
the
modern
church
of
St
Peter
of
the
Vatican
.
<EOS>
The
famous
temple
of
Jupiter
Capitolinus
was
neither
half
so
long
,
nor
half
so
broad
:
<EOS>
it
was
but
two
hundred
feet
in
length
,
and
one
hundred
and
eighty
-
five
in
breadth
;
whereas
the
length
of
St
Peter
's
extends
to
six
hundred
and
thirty
-
eight
feet
,
and
the
breadth
to
above
five
hundred
.
<EOS>
It
is
very
near
twice
as
large
as
the
temple
of
Jupiter
Olympius
in
Greece
,
which
was
counted
one
of
the
seven
wonders
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
But
I
shall
take
another
opportunity
to
explain
myself
further
on
the
antiquities
of
this
city
;
a
subject
,
upon
which
I
am
disposed
to
be
(
perhaps
impertinently
)
circumstantial
.
<EOS>
When
I
begin
to
run
riot
,
you
should
cheek
me
with
the
freedom
of
a
friend
.

The
most
distant

will
be
sufficient

DEAR
SIR
,
 
<EOS>
The
Colossaeum
or
amphitheatre
built
by
Flavius
Vespasian
,
is
the
most
stupendous
work
of
the
kind
which
antiquity
can
produce
.
<EOS>
Near
one
half
of
the
external
circuit
still
remains
,
consisting
of
four
tire
of
arcades
,
adorned
with
columns
of
four
orders
,
Doric
,
Ionic
,
Corinthian
,
and
Composite
.
<EOS>
The
height
and
extent
of
it
may
be
guessed
from
the
number
of
spectators
it
contained
,
amounting
to
one
hundred
thousand
;
and
yet
,
according
to
Fontana
's
mensuration
,
it
could
not
contain
above
thirty
-
four
thousand
persons
sitting
,
allowing
a
foot
and
an
half
for
each
person
:
for
the
circuit
of
the
whole
building
did
not
exceed
one
thousand
five
hundred
and
sixty
feet
.
<EOS>
The
amphitheatre
at
Verona
is
one
thousand
two
hundred
and
ninety
feet
in
circumference
;
and
that
of
Nismes
,
one
thousand
and
eighty
.
<EOS>
The
Colossaeum
was
built
by
Vespasian
,
who
employed
thirty
thousand
Jewish
slaves
in
the
work
;
but
finished
and
dedicated
by
his
son
Titus
,
who
,
on
the
first
day
of
its
being
opened
,
produced
fifty
thousand
wild
beasts
,
which
were
all
killed
in
the
arena
.
<EOS>
The
Romans
were
undoubtedly
a
barbarous
people
,
who
delighted
in
horrible
spectacles
.
<EOS>
They
viewed
with
pleasure
the
dead
bodies
of
criminals
dragged
through
the
streets
,
or
thrown
down
the
Scalae
Gemoniae
and
Tarpeian
rock
,
for
their
contemplation
.
<EOS>
Their
rostra
were
generally
adorned
with
the
heads
of
some
remarkable
citizens
,
like
Temple
-
Bar
,
at
London
.
<EOS>
They
even
bore
the
sight
of
Tully
's
head
fixed
upon
that
very
rostrum
where
he
had
so
often
ravished
their
ears
with
all
the
charms
of
eloquence
,
in
pleading
the
cause
of
innocence
and
public
virtue
.
<EOS>
They
took
delight
in
seeing
their
fellow
-
creatures
torn
in
pieces
by
wild
beasts
,
in
the
amphitheatre
.
<EOS>
They
shouted
with
applause
when
they
saw
a
poor
dwarf
or
slave
killed
by
his
adversary
;
but
their
transports
were
altogether
extravagant
,
when
the
devoted
captives
were
obliged
to
fight
in
troops
,
till
one
side
was
entirely
butchered
by
the
other
.
<EOS>
Nero
produced
four
hundred
senators
,
and
six
hundred
of
the
equestrian
order
,
as
gladiators
in
the
public
arena
:
even
the
women
fought
with
wild
beasts
,
as
well
as
with
each
other
,
and
drenched
the
amphitheatres
with
their
blood
.
<EOS>
Tacitus
says
,
"
Sed
faeminarum
illustrium
,
senatorumque
filiorum
plures
per
arenam
faedati
sunt
,
"
"
But
many
sons
of
Senators
,
and
even
Matrons
of
the
first
Rank
,
exposed
themselves
in
this
vile
exercise
.
"
<EOS>
The
execrable
custom
of
sacrificing
captives
or
slaves
at
the
tombs
of
their
masters
and
great
men
,
which
is
still
preserved
among
the
negroes
of
Africa
,
obtained
also
among
the
antients
,
Greeks
as
well
as
Romans
.
<EOS>
I
could
never
,
without
horror
and
indignation
,
read
that
passage
in
the
twenty
-
third
book
of
the
Iliad
,
which
describes
twelve
valiant
Trojan
captives
sacrificed
by
the
inhuman
Achilles
at
the
tomb
of
his
friend
Patroclus
.

Twelve

With

<EOS>
Even
Virgil
makes
his
pious
Hero
sacrifice
eight
Italian
youths
to
the
manes
of
Pallas
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
at
all
clear
to
me
,
that
a
people
is
the
more
brave
,
the
more
they
are
accustomed
to
bloodshed
in
their
public
entertainments
.
<EOS>
True
bravery
is
not
savage
but
humane
.
<EOS>
Some
of
this
sanguinary
spirit
is
inherited
by
the
inhabitants
of
a
certain
island
that
shall
be
nameless
 
<EOS>
but
,
mum
for
that
.
<EOS>
You
will
naturally
suppose
that
the
Coliseo
was
ruined
by
the
barbarians
who
sacked
the
city
of
Rome
:
in
effect
,
they
robbed
it
of
its
ornaments
and
valuable
materials
;
but
it
was
reserved
for
the
Goths
and
Vandals
of
modern
Rome
,
to
dismantle
the
edifice
,
and
reduce
it
to
its
present
ruinous
condition
.
<EOS>
One
part
of
it
was
demolished
by
pope
Paul
II
that
he
might
employ
the
stones
of
it
in
building
the
palace
of
St
Mark
.
<EOS>
It
was
afterwards
dilapidated
for
the
same
purposes
,
by
the
cardinals
Riarius
and
Farnese
,
which
last
assumed
the
tiara
under
the
name
of
Paul
III
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
these
injuries
,
there
is
enough
standing
to
convey
a
very
sublime
idea
of
ancient
magnificence
.
  
<EOS>
The
Circi
and
Naumachia
,
if
considered
as
buildings
and
artificial
basins
,
are
admirable
;
but
if
examined
as
areae
intended
for
horse
and
chariot
races
,
and
artificial
seas
for
exhibiting
naval
engagements
,
they
seem
to
prove
that
the
antient
Romans
were
but
indifferently
skilled
and
exercised
either
in
horsemanship
or
naval
armaments
.
<EOS>
The
inclosure
of
the
emperor
Caracalla
's
circus
is
still
standing
,
and
scarce
affords
breathing
room
for
an
English
hunter
.
<EOS>
The
Circus
Maximus
,
by
far
the
largest
in
Rome
,
was
not
so
long
as
the
Mall
;
and
I
will
venture
to
affirm
,
that
St
James
's
Park
would
make
a
much
more
ample
and
convenient
scene
for
those
diversions
.
<EOS>
I
imagine
an
old
Roman
would
be
very
much
surprised
to
see
an
English
race
on
the
course
at
New
-
Market
.
<EOS>
The
Circus
Maximus
was
but
three
hundred
yards
in
breadth
.
<EOS>
A
good
part
of
this
was
taken
up
by
the
spina
,
or
middle
space
,
adorned
with
temples
,
statues
,
and
two
great
obelisks
;
as
well
as
by
the
euripus
,
or
canal
,
made
by
order
of
Julius
Caesar
,
to
contain
crocodiles
,
and
other
aquatic
animals
,
which
were
killed
occasionally
.
<EOS>
This
was
so
large
,
that
Heliogabalus
,
having
filled
it
with
excellent
wine
,
exhibited
naval
engagements
in
it
,
for
the
amusement
of
the
people
.
<EOS>
It
surrounded
three
sides
of
the
square
,
so
that
the
whole
extent
of
the
race
did
not
much
exceed
an
English
mile
;
and
when
Probus
was
at
the
expence
of
filling
the
plain
of
it
with
fir
-
trees
to
form
a
wood
for
the
chace
of
wild
beasts
,
I
question
much
if
this
forest
was
more
extensive
than
the
plantation
in
St
James
's
Park
,
on
the
south
side
of
the
canal
:
now
I
leave
you
to
judge
what
ridicule
a
king
of
England
would
incur
by
converting
this
part
of
the
park
into
a
chace
for
any
species
of
animals
which
are
counted
game
in
our
country
.
  
<EOS>
The
Roman
emperors
seemed
more
disposed
to
elevate
and
surprize
,
than
to
conduct
the
public
diversions
according
to
the
rules
of
reason
and
propriety
.
<EOS>
One
would
imagine
,
it
was
with
this
view
they
instituted
their
naumachia
,
or
naval
engagements
,
performed
by
half
a
dozen
small
gallies
of
a
side
in
an
artificial
basin
of
fresh
water
.
<EOS>
These
gallies
I
suppose
were
not
so
large
as
common
fishing
-
smacks
,
for
they
were
moved
by
two
,
three
,
and
four
oars
of
a
side
according
to
their
different
rates
,
biremes
,
triremes
,
and
quadriremes
.
<EOS>
I
know
this
is
a
knotty
point
not
yet
determined
;
and
that
some
antiquarians
believe
the
Roman
gallies
had
different
tires
or
decks
of
oars
;
but
this
is
a
notion
very
ill
supported
,
and
quite
contrary
to
all
the
figures
of
them
that
are
preserved
on
antient
coins
and
medals
.
<EOS>
Suetonius
in
the
reign
of
Domitian
,
speaking
of
these
naumachia
,
says
,
"
Edidit
navales
pugnas
,
pene
justarum
classium
,
effosso
,
et
circumducto
juxta
Tyberim
lacu
,
<EOS>
atque
inter

,
"
"
He
exhibited
naval
engagements
of
almost
intire
fleets
,
in
an
artificial
Lake
formed
for
the
purpose
hard
by
the
Tyber
,
and
viewed
them
in
the
midst
of
excessive
Rains
.
<EOS>
"
This
artificial
lake
was
not
larger
than
the
piece
of
water
in
Hyde
-
Park
;
and
yet
the
historian
says
,
it
was
almost
large
enough
for
real
or
intire
fleets
.
<EOS>
How
would
a
British
sailor
relish
an
advertisement
that
a
mock
engagement
between
two
squadrons
of
men
of
war
would
be
exhibited
on
such
a
day
in
the
Serpentine
river
?
<EOS>
or
that
the
ships
of
the
line
taken
from
the
enemy
would
be
carried
in
procession
from
Hyde
-
Park
-
Corner
to
Tower
-
wharf
?
<EOS>
Certain
it
is
,
Lucullus
,
in
one
of
his
triumphs
,
had
one
hundred
and
ten
ships
of
war
<EOS>
(
naves
longas
)
carried
through
the
streets
of
Rome
.
<EOS>
Nothing
can
give
a
more
contemptible
idea
of
their
naval
power
,
than
this
testimony
of
their
historians
,
who
declare
that
their
seamen
or
mariners
were
formed
by
exercising
small
row
-
boats
in
an
inclosed
pool
of
fresh
water
.
<EOS>
Had
they
not
the
sea
within
a
few
miles
of
them
,
and
the
river
Tyber
running
through
their
capital
!
<EOS>
even
this
would
have
been
much
more
proper
for
exercising
their
watermen
,
than
a
pond
of
still
-
water
,
not
much
larger
than
a
cold
-
bath
.
<EOS>
I
do
believe
in
my
conscience
that
half
a
dozen
English
frigates
would
have
been
able
to
defeat
both
the
contending
fleets
at
the
famous
battle
of
Actium
,
which
has
been
so
much
celebrated
in
the
annals
of
antiquity
,
as
an
event
that
decided
the
fate
of
empire
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
employ
me
a
whole
month
to
describe
the
thermae
or
baths
,
the
vast
ruins
of
which
are
still
to
be
seen
within
the
walls
of
Rome
,
like
the
remains
of
so
many
separate
citadels
.
<EOS>
The
thermae
Dioclesianae
might
be
termed
an
august
academy
for
the
use
and
instruction
of
the
Roman
people
.
<EOS>
The
pinacotheca
of
this
building
was
a
complete
musaeum
of
all
the
curiosities
of
art
and
nature
;
and
there
were
public
schools
for
all
the
sciences
.
<EOS>
If
I
may
judge
by
my
eye
,
however
,
the
thermae
Antonianae
built
by
Caracalla
,
were
still
more
extensive
and
magnificent
;
they
contained
cells
sufficient
for
two
thousand
three
hundred
persons
to
bathe
at
one
time
,
without
being
seen
by
one
another
.
<EOS>
They
were
adorned
with
all
the
charms
of
painting
,
architecture
,
and
sculpture
.
<EOS>
The
pipes
for
convoying
the
water
were
of
silver
.
<EOS>
Many
of
the
lavacra
were
of
precious
marble
,
illuminated
by
lamps
of
chrystal
.
<EOS>
Among
the
statues
,
were
found
the
famous
Toro
,
and
Hercole
Farnese
.
  
<EOS>
Bathing
was
certainly
necessary
to
health
and
cleanliness
in
a
hot
country
like
Italy
,
especially
before
the
use
of
linen
was
known
:
but
these
purposes
would
have
been
much
better
answered
by
plunging
into
the
Tyber
,
than
by
using
the
warm
bath
in
the
thermae
,
which
became
altogether
a
point
of
luxury
borrowed
from
the
effeminate
Asiatics
,
and
tended
to
debilitate
the
fibres
already
too
much
relaxed
by
the
heat
of
the
climate
.
<EOS>
True
it
is
,
they
had
baths
of
cool
water
for
the
summer
:
but
in
general
they
used
it
milk
-
warm
,
and
often
perfumed
:
they
likewise
indulged
in
vapour
-
baths
,
in
order
to
enjoy
a
pleasing
relaxation
,
which
they
likewise
improved
with
odoriferous
ointments
.
  
<EOS>
The
thermae
consisted
of
a
great
variety
of
parts
and
conveniences
;
the
natationes
,
or
swimming
places
;
the
portici
,
where
people
amused
themselves
in
walking
,
conversing
,
and
disputing
together
,
as
Cicero
says
,
In
porticibus
deambulantes
disputabant
;
the
basilicae
,
where
the
bathers
assembled
,
before
they
entered
,
and
after
they
came
out
of
the
bath
;
the
atria
,
or
ample
courts
,
adorned
with
noble
colonnades
of
Numidian
marble
and
oriental
granite
;
the
ephibia
,
where
the
young
men
inured
themselves
to
wrestling
and
other
exercises
;
the
frigidaria
,
or
places
kept
cool
by
a
constant
draught
of
air
,
promoted
by
the
disposition
and
number
of
the
windows
;
the
calidaria
,
where
the
water
was
warmed
for
the
baths
;
the
platanones
,
or
delightful
groves
of
sycamore
;
the
stadia
,
for
the
performances
of
the
athletae
;
the
exedrae
,
or
resting
-
places
,
provided
with
seats
for
those
that
were
weary
;
the
palestrae
,
where
every
one
chose
that
exercise
which
pleased
him
best
;
the
gymnasia
,
where
poets
,
orators
,
and
philosophers
recited
their
works
,
and
harangued
for
diversion
;
the
eleotesia
,
where
the
fragrant
oils
and
ointments
were
kept
for
the
use
of
the
bathers
;
and
the
conisteria
,
where
the
wrestlers
were
smeared
with
sand
before
they
engaged
.
<EOS>
Of
the
thermae
in
Rome
,
some
were
mercenary
,
and
some
opened
gratis
.
<EOS>
Marcus
Agrippa
,
when
he
was
edile
,
opened
one
hundred
and
seventy
private
baths
,
for
the
use
of
the
people
.
<EOS>
In
the
public
baths
,
where
money
was
taken
,
each
person
paid
a
quadrans
,
about
the
value
of
our
halfpenny
,
as

And
for

public
Bath
a
farthing
pay
.
  
<EOS>
But
after
the
hour
of
bathing
was
past
,
it
sometimes
cost
a
great

more
,
according
to

The

An

<EOS>
Though
there
was
no
distinction
in
the
places
between
the
first
patrician
and
the
lowest
plebeian
,
yet
the
nobility
used
their
own
silver
and
gold
plate
,
for
washing
,
eating
,
and
drinking
in
the
bath
,
together
with
towels
of
the
finest
linen
.
<EOS>
They
likewise
made
use
of
the
instrument
called
strigil
,
which
was
a
kind
of
flesh
-
brush
;
a
custom
to
which
Persius
alludes
in
this
line
,
  
I

Brush

's
Bagnio

<EOS>
The
common
people
contented
themselves
with
sponges
.
<EOS>
The
bathing
time
was
from
noon
till
the
evening
,
when
the
Romans
ate
their
principal
meal
.
<EOS>
Notice
was
given
by
a
bell
,
or
some
such
instrument
,
when
the
baths
were
opened
,
as
we
learn
from
Juvenal
,
  
Redde

<EOS>
Perhaps
the

<EOS>
There
were
separate
places
for
the
two
sexes
;
and
indeed
there
were
baths
opened
for
the
use
of
women
only
,
at
the
expence
of
Agrippina
,
the
mother
of
Nero
,
and
some
other
matrons
of
the
first
quality
.
<EOS>
The
use
of
bathing
was
become
so
habitual
to
the
constitutions
of
the
Romans
,
that
Galen
,
in
his
book
De
Sanitate
tuenda
,
mentions
a
certain
philosopher
,
who
,
if
he
intermitted
but
one
day
in
his
bathing
,
was
certainly
attacked
with
a
fever
.
<EOS>
In
order
to
preserve
decorum
in
the
baths
,
a
set
of
laws
and
regulations
were
published
,
and
the
thermae
were
put
under
the
inspection
of
a
censor
,
who
was
generally
one
of
the
first
senators
in
Rome
.
<EOS>
Agrippa
left
his
gardens
and
baths
,
which
stood
near
the
pantheon
,
to
the
Roman
people
:
among
the
statues
that
adorned
them
was
that
of
a
youth
naked
,
as
going
into
the
bath
,
so
elegantly
formed
by
the
hand
of
Lysippus
,
that
Tiberius
,
being
struck
with
the
beauty
of
it
,
ordered
it
to
be
transferred
into
his
own
palace
:
but
the
populace
raised
such
a
clamour
against
him
,
that
he
was
fain
to
have
it
reconveyed
to
its
former
place
.
<EOS>
These
noble
baths
were
restored
by
Adrian
,
as
we
read
in
Spartian
;
but
at
present
no
part
of
them
remains
.
  
<EOS>
With
respect
to
the
present
state
of
the
old
aqueducts
,
I
can
give
you
very
little
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
I
only
saw
the
ruins
of
that
which
conveyed
the
aqua
Claudia
,
near
the
Porta
Maggiore
,
and
the
Piazza
of
the
Lateran
.
<EOS>
You
know
there
were
fourteen
of
those
antient
aqueducts
,
some
of
which
brought
water
to
Rome
from
the
distance
of
forty
miles
.
<EOS>
The
channels
of
them
were
large
enough
to
admit
a
man
armed
on
horseback
;
and
therefore
when
Rome
was
besieged
by
the
Goths
,
who
had
cut
off
the
water
,
Belisarius
fortified
them
with
works
to
prevent
the
enemy
from
entering
the
city
by
those
conveyances
.
<EOS>
After
that
period
,
I
suppose
the
antient
aqueducts
continued
dry
,
and
were
suffered
to
run
to
ruins
.
<EOS>
Without
all
doubt
,
the
Romans
were
greatly
obliged
to
those
benefactors
,
who
raised
such
stupendous
works
for
the
benefit
,
as
well
as
the
embellishment
of
their
city
:
but
it
might
have
been
supplied
with
the
same
water
through
pipes
at
one
hundredth
part
of
the
expence
;
and
in
that
case
the
enemy
would
not
have
found
it
such
an
easy
matter
to
cut
it
off
.
<EOS>
Those
popes
who
have
provided
the
modern
city
so
plentifully
with
excellent
water
,
are
much
to
be
commended
for
the
care
and
expence
,
they
have
bestowed
in
restoring
the
streams
called
acqua
Virgine
,
acqua
Felice
,
and
acqua
Paolina
,
which
afford
such
abundance
of
water
as
would
plentifully
supply
a
much
larger
city
than
modern
Rome
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
no
wonder
that
M
Agrippa
,
the
son
-
in
-
law
,
friend
,
and
favourite
of
Augustus
,
should
at
the
same
time
have
been
the
idol
of
the
people
,
considering
how
surprisingly
he
exerted
himself
for
the
emolument
,
convenience
,
and
pleasure
of
his
fellow
-
citizens
.
<EOS>
It
was
he
who
first
conducted
this
acqua
Virgine
to
Rome
:
he
formed
seven
hundred
reservoirs
in
the
city
;
erected
one
hundred
and
five
fountains
;
one
hundred
and
thirty
castella
,
or
conduits
,
which
works
he
adorned
with
three
hundred
statues
,
and
four
hundred
pillars
of
marble
,
in
the
space
of
one
year
.
<EOS>
He
also
brought
into
Rome
,
the
aqua
Julia
,
and
restored
the
aqueduct
of
the
aqua
Marzia
,
which
had
fallen
to
decay
.
<EOS>
I
have
already
observed
the
great
number
of
baths
which
he
opened
for
the
people
,
and
the
magnificent
thermae
,
with
spacious
gardens
,
which
he
bequeathed
to
them
as
a
legacy
.
<EOS>
But
these
benefactions
,
great
and
munificent
as
they
seem
to
be
,
were
not
the
most
important
services
he
performed
for
the
city
of
Rome
.
<EOS>
The
common
-
sewers
were
first
made
by
order
of
Tarquinius
Priscus
,
not
so
much
with
a
view
to
cleanliness
,
as
by
way
of
subterranean
drains
to
the
Velabrum
,
and
in
order
to
carry
off
the
stagnant
water
,
which
remained
in
the
lower
parts
,
after
heavy
rains
.
<EOS>
The
different
branches
of
these
channels
united
at
the
Forum
,
from
whence
by
the
cloaca
Maxima
,
their
contents
were
conveyed
into
the
Tyber
.
<EOS>
This
great
cloaca
was
the
work
of
Tarquinius
Superbus
.
<EOS>
Other
sewers
were
added
by
Marcus
Cato
,
and
Valerius
Flaccus
,
the
censors
.
<EOS>
All
these
drains
having
been
choaked
up
and
ruinous
,
were
cleared
and
restored
by
Marcus
Agrippa
,
who
likewise
undermined
the
whole
city
with
canals
of
the
same
kind
,
for
carrying
of
the
filth
;
he
strengthened
and
enlarged
the
cloaca
maxima
,
so
as
to
make
it
capable
of
receiving
a
large
cart
loaded
with
hay
;
and
directed
seven
streams
of
water
into
these
subterranean
passages
,
in
order
to
keep
them
always
clean
and
open
.
<EOS>
If
,
notwithstanding
all
these
conveniences
,
Vespasian
was
put
to
great
expence
in
removing
the
ordure
from
the
public
streets
,
we
have
certainly
a
right
to
conclude
that
the
antient
Romans
were
not
more
cleanly
than
the
modern
Italians
.
  
<EOS>
After
the
mausolea
of
Augustus
,
and
Adrian
,
which
I
have
already
mentioned
,
the
most
remarkable
antient
sepulchres
at
Rome
,
are
those
of
Caius
Cestius
,
and
Cecilia
Metella
.
<EOS>
The
first
,
which
stands
by
the
Porta
di
S
Paolo
,
is
a
beautiful
pyramid
,
one
hundred
and
twenty
feet
high
,
still
preserved
intire
,
having
a
vaulted
chamber
within
-
side
,
adorned
with
some
ancient
painting
,
which
is
now
almost
effaced
.
<EOS>
The
building
is
of
brick
,
but
eased
with
marble
.
<EOS>
This
Caius
Cestius
had
been
consul
,
was
very
rich
,
and
acted
as
one
of
the
seven
Epulones
,
who
superintended
the
feasts
of
the
gods
,
called
Lectisternia
,
and
Pervigilia
.
<EOS>
He
bequeathed
his
whole
fortune
to
his
friend
M
Agrippa
,
who
was
so
generous
as
to
give
it
up
to
the
relations
of
the
testator
.
<EOS>
The
monument
of
Cecilia
Metella
,
commonly
called
Capo
di
Bove
,
is
without
the
walls
on
the
Via
Appia
.
<EOS>
This
lady
was
daughter
of
Metellus
Creticus
,
and
wife
to
Crassus
,
who
erected
this
noble
monument
to
her
memory
.
<EOS>
It
consisted
of
two
orders
,
or
stories
,
the
first
of
which
was
a
square
of
hewn
stone
:
the
second
was
a
circular
tower
,
having
a
cornice
,
adorned
with
ox
heads
in
basso
relievo
,
a
circumstance
from
which
it
takes
the
name
of
Capo
di
Bove
.
<EOS>
The
ox
was
supposed
to
be
a
most
grateful
sacrifice
to
the
gods
.
<EOS>
Pliny
,
speaking
of
bulls
and
oxen
,
says
,
  
Hinc
victimae
optimae
<EOS>
et
laudatissima
deorum
placatio
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
accounted
the
best
Victims
and
most
agreeable
to
appease
the
anger
of
the
Gods
.
  
<EOS>
This
tower
was
surmounted
by
a
noble
cupola
or
dome
,
enriched
with
all
the
ornaments
of
architecture
.
<EOS>
The
door
of
the
building
was
of
brass
;
and
within
-
side
the
ashes
of
Cecilia
were
deposited
in
a
fluted
marble
urn
,
of
curious
workmanship
,
which
is
still
kept
in
the
Palazzo
Farnese
.
<EOS>
At
present
the
surface
of
the
ground
is
raised
so
much
as
to
cover
the
first
order
of
the
edifice
:
what
we
see
is
no
more
than
the
round
tower
,
without
the
dome
and
its
ornaments
;
and
the
following
inscription
still
remains
near
the
top
,
facing
the
Via
Appia

<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
YOU
must
not
imagine
I
saw
one
half
of
the
valuable
pictures
and
statues
of
Rome
;
there
is
such
a
vast
number
of
both
in
this
capital
,
that
I
might
have
spent
a
whole
year
in
taking
even
a
transient
view
of
them
;
and
,
after
all
,
some
of
them
would
have
been
overlooked
.
<EOS>
The
most
celebrated
pieces
,
however
,
I
have
seen
;
and
therefore
my
curiosity
is
satisfied
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
if
I
had
the
nice
discernment
and
delicate
sensibility
of
a
true
connoisseur
,
this
superficial
glimpse
would
have
served
only
to
whet
my
appetite
,
and
to
detain
me
the
whole
winter
at
Rome
.
<EOS>
In
my
progress
through
the
Vatican
,
I
was
much
pleased
with
the
School
of
Athens
,
by
Raphael
,
a
piece
which
hath
suffered
from
the
dampness
of
the
air
.

Mr
Webb
's
criticism
on
this
artist
is
certainly
just
.
<EOS>
He
was
perhaps
the
best
ethic
painter
that
ever
the
world
produced
.
<EOS>
No
man
ever
expressed
the
sentiments
so
happily
,
in
visage
,
attitude
,
and
gesture
:
but
he
seems
to
have
had
too
much
phlegm
to
strike
off
the
grand
passions
,
or
reach
the
sublime
parts
of
painting
.
<EOS>
He
has
the
serenity
of
Virgil
,
but
wants
the
fire
of
Homer
.
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
in
his
Parnassus
which
struck
me
,
but
the
ludicrous
impropriety
of
Apollo
's
playing
upon
a
fiddle
,
for
the
entertainment
of
the
nine
muses
.
<EOS>
[
Upon
better
information
I
must
retract
this
censure
;
in
as
much
,
as
I
find
there
was
really
a
Musical
Instrument
among
the
antients
of
this
Figure

appears
by
a
small
statue

Bronze

be
still

The
Last
Judgment
,
by
Buonaroti
,
in
the
chapel
of
Sixtus
IV
produced
to
my
eye
the
same
sort
of
confusion
,
that
perplexes
my
ear
at
a
grand
concert
,
consisting
of
a
great
variety
of
instruments
:
or
rather
,
when
a
number
of
people
are
talking
all
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
was
pleased
with
the
strength
of
expression
,
exhibited
in
single
figures
,
and
separate
groupes
:
<EOS>
but
,
the
whole
together
is
a
mere
mob
,
without
subordination
,
keeping
,
or
repose
.
<EOS>
A
painter
ought
to
avoid
all
subjects
that
require
a
multiplicity
of
groupes
and
figures
;
because
it
is
not
in
the
power
of
that
art
to
unite
a
great
number
in
one
point
of
view
,
so
as
to
maintain
that
dependence
which
they
ought
to
have
upon
one
another
.

Michael
Angelo
,
with
all
his
skill
in
anatomy
,
his
correctness
of
design
,
his
grand
composition
,
his
fire
,
and
force
of
expression
,
seems
to
have
had
very
little
idea
of
grace
.
<EOS>
One
would
imagine
he
had
chosen
his
kings
,
heroes
,
cardinals
,
and
prelates
,
from
among
the
facchini
of
Rome
:
that
he
really
drew
his
Jesus
on
the
Cross
,
from
the
agonies
of
some
vulgar
assassin
expiring
on
the
wheel
;
and
that
the
originals
of
his
Bambini
,
with
their
mothers
,
were
literally
found
in
a
stable

In
the
Sala
Regia
,
from
whence
the

we

,
among

a
representation
of
the
massacre
of
the
protestants
in
Paris

Tholouse

Thus
the
court
of
Rome
hath
employed
their
artists
to
celebrate
and
perpetuate
,
as
a
meritorious
action
,
the
most
perfidious
,
cruel
,
and
infamous
massacre
,
that
ever
disgraced
the
annals
of
any
nation

<EOS>
I
need
not
mention
the
two
equestrian
statues
of
Constantine
the
Great
,
and
Charlemagne
,
which
stand
at
opposite
ends
of
the
great
portico
of
St
Peter
's
church

there
is
nothing
in
them
which
particularly
engaged
my
attention

The
sleeping
Cleopatra
,
as
you
enter
the
court
of
the
Belvedere
,
in
the
Vatican
,
is
much
admired
;
but
I
was
better
pleased
with
the
Apollo
,
which
I
take
to
be
the
most
beautiful
statue
that
ever
was
formed
.
<EOS>
The
Nile
,
which
lies
in
the
open
court
,
surmounted
with
the
little
children
,
has
infinite
merit
;
but
is
much
damaged
,
and
altogether
neglected
.
<EOS>
Whether
it
is
the
same
described
in
Pliny
,
as
having
been
placed
by
Vespasian
in
the
Temple
of
Peace
,
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
The
sixteen
children
playing
about
it

denoted
the
swelling

the
Nile

which
never
rose
above
sixteen
cubits

<EOS>
As
for
the
famous
groupe
of
Laocoon
,
it
surpassed
my
expectation
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
without
reason
that
Buonaroti
called
it
a
portentous
work
;
and
Pliny
has
done
it
no
more
than
justice
in
saying
it
is
the
most
excellent
piece
that
ever
was
cut
in
marble
;
and
yet
the
famous
Fulvius
Ursini
is
of
opinion
that
this
is
not
the
same
statue
which
Pliny
described
.
<EOS>
His
reasons
,
mentioned
by
Montfaucon
,
are
these
.
<EOS>
The
statues
described
by
Pliny
were
of
one
stone
;
but
these
are
not
.
<EOS>
Antonioli
,
the
antiquary
,
has
in
his
Possession
,
pieces
of
Laocoon
's
snakes
,
which
were
found
in
the
ground
,
where
the
baths
of
Titus
actually
stood
,
agreeable
to
Pliny
,
who
says
these
statues
were
placed
in
the
buildings
of
Titus
.
<EOS>
Be
that
as
it
may
,
the
work
which
we
now
see
does
honour
to
antiquity
.
<EOS>
As
you
have
seen
innumerable
copies
and
casts
of
it
,
in
marble
,
plaister
,
copper
,
lead
,
drawings
,
and
prints
,
and
read
the
description
of
it
in
Keysler
,
and
twenty
other
books
of
travels
,
I
shall
say
nothing
more
on
the
subject
;
but
that
neither
they
nor
I
,
nor
any
other
person
,
could
say
too
much
in
its
praise
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
of
one
piece
indeed

In
that
particular
Pliny

might
be
mistaken

This
amazing

is
the
work
of
three
Rhodian
sculptors

called
Agesander

Polydore

Athenodorus

was

As
for
the
torso
,
or
mutilated
trunk
of
a
statue
,
which
is
called
the
school
of
Michael
Angelo
,
I
had
not
time
to
consider
it
attentively
;
nor
taste
enough
to
perceive
its
beauties
at
first
sight
.
<EOS>
The
famous
horses
on
Monte
Cavallo
,
before
the
pope
's
palace
,
which
are
said
to
have
been
made
in
emulation
,
by
Phidias
and
Praxiteles
,
I
have
seen
,
and
likewise
those
in
the
front
of
the
Capitol
,
with
the
statues
of
Castor
and
Pollux
;
but
what
pleased
me
infinitely
more
than
all
of
them
together
,
is
the
equestrian
statue
of
Corinthian
brass
,
standing
in
the
middle
of
this
Piazza
<EOS>
(
I
mean
at
the
Capitol
)
said
to
represent
the
emperor
Marcus
Aurelius
.
<EOS>
Others
suppose
it
was
intended
for
Lucius
Verus
;
a
third
set
of
antiquaries
contend
for
Lucius
Septimius
Severus
;
and
a
fourth
,
for
Constantine
,
because
it
stood
in
the
Piazza
of
the
Lateran
palace
,
built
by
that
emperor
,
<EOS>
from
whence
pope
Paul
III
caused
it
to
be
removed
to
the
Capitol
.
<EOS>
I
considered
the
trophy
of
Marius
as
a
very
curious
piece
of
sculpture
,
and
admired
the
two
sphinxes
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
leading
to
this
Piazza
,
as
the
only
good
specimens
of
design
I
have
ever
seen
from
Aegypt
:
for
the
two
idols
of
that
country
,
which
stand
in
the
ground
floor
of
the
Musaeum
of
the
Capitol
,
and
indeed
all
the
Aegyptian
statues
in
the
Camera
Aegyptiaca
of
this
very
building
,
are
such
monstrous
misrepresentations
of
nature
,
that
they
never
could
have
obtained
a
place
among
the
statues
of
Rome
,
except
as
curiosities
of
foreign
superstition
,
or
on
account
of
the
materials
,
as
they
are
generally
of
basaltes
,
porphyry
,
or
oriental
granite
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
farther
end
of
the
court
of
this
Musaeum
,
fronting
the
entrance
,
is
a
handsome
fountain
,
with
the
statue
of
a
river
-
god
reclining
on
his
urn
;
this
is
no
other
than
the
famous
Marforio
,
so
called
from
its
having
been
found
in
Martis
Fore
.
<EOS>
It
is
remarkable
only
as
being
the
conveyance
of
the
answers
to
the
satires
which
are
found
pasted
upon
Pasquin
,
another
mutilated
statue
,
standing
at
the
corner
of
a
street
.
  
<EOS>
The
marble
coffin
,
supposed
to
have
contained
the
ashes
of
Alexander
Severus
,
which
we
find
in
one
of
these
apartments
,
is
a
curious
antique
,
valuable
for
its
sculpture
in
basso
relievo
,
especially
for
the
figures
on
the
cover
,
representilig
that
emperor
and
his
mother
Julia
Mammea

<EOS>
I
was
sorry
<EOS>
I
had
not
time
to
consider
the
antient
plan
of
Rome
<EOS>
,
disposed
in
six
classes
,
on
the
stair
-
case
of
this
Musaeum
,
which
was
brought
hither
from
a
temple
that
stood
in
the
Forum
Boarium
,
now
called
Campo
vaccine
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
be
ridiculous
in
me
to
enter
into
a
detail
of
the
vast
collection
of
marbles
,
basso
relievos
,
inscriptions
,
urns
,
busts
,
and
statues
,
which
are
placed
in
the
upper
apartments
of
this
edifice
.
<EOS>
I
saw
them
but
once
,
and
then
I
was
struck
with
the
following
particulars
.
<EOS>
A
bacchanalian
drunk
;
a
Jupiter
and
Leda
,
at
least
equal
to
that
in
the
gallery
at
Florence
;
an
old
praesica
,
or
hired
mourner
,
very
much
resembling
those
wrinkled
hags
still
employed
in
Ireland
,
and
in
the
Highlands
of
Scotland
,
to
sing
the
coronach
at
funerals
,
in
praise
of
the
deceased
;
the
famous
Antinous
,
an
elegant
figure
,
which
Pousin
studied
as
canon
or
rule
of
symmetry
;
the
two
fauns
;
and
above
all
the
mirmillone
,
or
dying
gladiator
;
the
attitude
of
the
body
,
the
expression
of
the
countenance
,
the
elegance
of
the
limbs
,
and
the
swelling
of
the
muscles
,
in
this
statue
,
are
universally
admired
;
but
the
execution
of
the
back
is
incredibly
delicate
.
<EOS>
The
course
of
the
muscles
called
longissimi
dorsi
,
are
so
naturally
marked
and
tenderly
executed
,
that
the
marble
actually
emulates
the
softness
of
the
flesh
;
and
you
may
count
all
the
spines
of
the
vertebrae
,
raising
up
the
skin
as
in
the
living
body
;
yet
this
statue
,
with
all
its
merit
,
seems
inferior
to
the
celebrated
dying
gladiator
of
Ctesilas
,
as
described
by
Pliny
,
who
says
the
expression
of
it
was
such
,
as
appears
altogether
incredible
.
<EOS>
In
the
court
,
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
Capitol
,
there
is
an
admirable
statue
of
a
lion
devouring
an
horse
,
which
was
found
by
the
gate
of
Ostia
,
near
the
pyramid
of
Caius
Cestius
;
and
here
on
the
left
hand
,
under
a
colonade
,
is
what
they
call
the
Columna
Rostrata
,
erected
in
honour
of
Caius
Duilius
,
who
first
triumphed
over
the
Carthaginians
by
sea
.
<EOS>
But
this
is
a
modern
pillar
,
with
the
old
inscription
,
which
is
so
defaced
as
not
to
be
legible
.
<EOS>
Among
the
pictures
in
the
gallery
and
saloon
above
,
what
pleased
me
most
was
the
Bacchus
and
Ariadne
of
Guido
Rheni
;
and
the
wolf
suckling
Romulus
and
Remus
,
by
Rubens
.
<EOS>
The
court
of
the
Palazzo
Farnese
is
surrounded
with
antique
statues
,
among
which
the
most
celebrated
are
,
the
Flora
,
with
a
most
delicate
drapery
;
the
gladiator
,
with
a
dead
boy
over
his
shoulder
;
the
Hercules
,
with
the
spoils
of
the
Nemean
lion
,
but
that
which
the
connoisseurs
justly
esteem
above
all
the
rest
is
Hercules
,
by
Glycon
,
which
you
know
as
well
as
I
do
,
by
the
great
reputation
it
has
acquired
.
<EOS>
This
admirable
statue
having
been
found
without
the
legs
,
these
were
supplied
by
Gulielmo
de
la
Porta
<EOS>
so
happily
,
that
when
afterwards
the
original
limbs
were
discovered
,
Michael
Angelo
preferred
those
of
the
modern
artist
,
both
in
grace
and
proportion
;
and
they
have
been
retained
accordingly
.
<EOS>
In
a
little
house
,
or
shed
,
behind
the
court
,
is
preserved
the
wonderful
group
of
Dirce
,
commonly
called
the
Toro
Farnese
,
which
was
brought
hither
from
the
thermae
Caracallae
.
<EOS>
There
is
such
spirit
,
ferocity
,
and
indignant
resistance
expressed
in
the
bull
,
to
whose
horns
Dirce
is
tied
by
the
hair
,
that
I
have
never
seen
anything
like
it
,
either
upon
canvass
,
or
in
stone
.
<EOS>
The
statues
of
the
two
brothers
endeavouring
to
throw
him
into
the
sea
are
beautiful
figures
,
finely
contrasted
;
and
the
rope
,
which
one
of
them
holds
in
a
sort
of
loose
coil
,
is
so
surprisingly
chizzelled
,
that
one
can
hardly
believe
it
is
of
stone
.
<EOS>
As
for
Dirce
herself
,
she
seems
to
be
but
a
subaltern
character
;
there
is
a
dog
upon
his
hind
legs
barking
at
the
bull
,
which
is
much
admired
.
<EOS>
This
amazing
groupe
was
cut
out
of
one
stone
,
by
Appollonius
and
Tauriscus
,
two
sculptors
of
Rhodes
;
and
is
mentioned
by
Pliny
in
the
thirty-
sixth
book
of
his
Natural
History
.
<EOS>
All
the
precious
monuments
of
art
,
which
have
come
down
to
us
from
antiquity
,
are
the
productions
of
Greek
artists
.
<EOS>
The
Romans
had
taste
enough
to
admire
the
arts
of
Greece
,
as
plainly
appears
by
the
great
collections
they
made
of
their
statues
and
pictures
,
as
well
as
by
adopting
their
architecture
and
musick
:
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
remember
to
have
read
of
any
Roman
who
made
a
great
figure
either
as
a
painter
or
a
statuary
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
enough
to
say
those
professions
were
not
honourable
in
Rome
,
because
painting
,
sculpture
,
and
musick
,
even
rhetoric
,
physic
,
and
philosophy
were
practised
and
taught
by
slaves
.
<EOS>
The
arts
were
always
honoured
and
revered
at
Rome
,
even
when
the
professors
of
them
happened
to
be
slaves
by
the
accidents
and
iniquity
of
fortune
.
<EOS>
The
business
of
painting
and
statuary
was
so
profitable
,
that
in
a
free
republic
,
like
that
of
Rome
,
they
must
have
been
greedily
embraced
by
a
great
number
of
individuals
:
but
,
in
all
probability
,
the
Roman
soil
produced
no
extraordinary
genius
for
those
arts
.
<EOS>
Like
the
English
of
this
day
,
they
made
a
figure
in
poetry
,
history
,
and
ethics
;
but
the
excellence
of
painting
,
sculpture
,
architecture
,
and
music
,
they
never
could
attain
.
<EOS>
In
the
Palazzo
Picchini
I
saw
three
beautiful
figures
,
the
celebrated
statues
of
Meleager
,
the
boar
,
and
dog
;
together
with
a
wolf
,
of
excellent
workmanship
.
<EOS>
The
celebrated
statue
of
Moses
,
by
Michael
Angelo
,
in
the
church
of
St
Peter
in
Vincula
,
I
beheld
with
pleasure
;
as
well
as
that
of
Christ
,
by
the
same
hand
,
in
the
Church
of
S
Maria
sopra
Minerva
.
<EOS>
The
right
foot
,
covered
with
bronze
,
gilt
,
is
much
kissed
by
the
devotees
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
is
looked
upon
as
a
specific
for
the
toothache
;
for
,
I
saw
a
cavalier
,
in
years
,
and
an
old
woman
successively
rub
their
gums
upon
it
,
with
the
appearance
of
the
most
painful
perseverance
.
  
<EOS>
You
need
not
doubt
but
that
I
went
to
the
church
of
St
Peter
in
Montorio
,
to
view
the
celebrated
Transfiguration
,
by
Raphael
,
which
,
if
it
was
mine
,
I
would
cut
in
two
parts
.
<EOS>
The
three
figures
in
the
air
attract
the
eye
so
strongly
,
that
little
or
no
attention
is
payed
to
those
below
on
the
mountain
.
<EOS>
I
apprehend
that
the
nature
of
the
subject
does
not
admit
of
that
keeping
and
dependence
,
which
ought
to
be
maintained
in
the
disposition
of
the
lights
and
shadows
in
a
picture
.
<EOS>
The
groupes
seem
to
be
intirely
independent
of
each
other
.
<EOS>
The
extraordinary
merit
of
this
piece
,
I
imagine
,
consists
,
not
only
in
the
expression
of
divinity
on
the
face
of
Christ
;
but
also
in
the
surprising
lightness
of
the
figure
,
<EOS>
that
hovers
like
a
beautiful
exhalation
in
the
air
.
<EOS>
In
the
church
of
St
Luke
,
I
was
not
at
all
struck
by
the
picture
of
that
saint
,
drawing
the
portrait
of
the
Virgin
Mary
,
although
it
is
admired
as
one
of
the
best
pieces
of
Raphael
.
<EOS>
Indeed
it
made
so
little
impression
upon
me
,
that
I
do
not
even
remember
the
disposition
of
the
figures
.
<EOS>
The
altar
-
piece
,
by
Andrea
Sacchi
,
in
the
church
of
St
Romauldus
,
would
have
more
merit
,
if
the
figure
of
the
saint
himself
had
more
consequence
,
and
was
represented
in
a
stronger
light
.
<EOS>
In
the
Palazzo
Borghese
,
I
chiefly
admired
the
following
pieces
:
a
Venus
with
two
nymphs
;
and
another
with
Cupid
,
both
by
Titian
:
an
excellent
Roman
Piety
,
by
Leonardo
da
Vinci
;
and
the
celebrated
Muse
,
by
Dominechino
,
which
is
a
fine
,
jolly
,
buxom
figure
.
<EOS>
At
the
palace
of
Colorina
Connestabile
,
I
was
charmed
with
the
Herodias
,
by
Guido
Rheni
;
a
young
Christ
;
and
a
Madonna
,
by
Raphael
;
and
four
landscapes
,
two
by
Claude
Lorraine
,
and
the
other
two
,
by
Salvator
Rosa
.
<EOS>
In
the
palazetto
,
or
summerhouse
belonging
to
the
Palazzo
Rospigliosi
,
I
had
the
satisfaction
of
contemplating
the
Aurora
of
Guido
,
the
colours
of
which
still
remain
in
high
perfection
,
notwithstanding
the
common
report
that
the
piece
is
spoiled
by
the
dampness
of
the
apartment
.
<EOS>
The
print
of
this
picture
,
by
Freij
,
with
all
its
merit
,
conveys
but
an
imperfect
idea
of
the
beauty
of
the
original
.
<EOS>
In
the
Palazzo
Barberini
,
there
is
a
great
collection
of
marbles
and
pictures
:
among
the
first
,
I
was
attracted
by
a
beautiful
statue
of
Venus
;
a
sleeping
faun
,
of
curious
workmanship
;
a
charming
Bacchus
,
lying
on
an
antient
sculpture
,
and
the
famous
Narcissus
.
<EOS>
Of
the
pictures
,
what
gave
me
most
pleasure
was
the
Magdalen
of
Guido
,
infinitely
superior
to
that
by
Le
Brun
in
the
church
of
the
Carmelites
at
Paris
;
the
Virgin
,
by
Titian
;
a
Madonna
,
by
Raphael
,
but
not
comparable
to
that
which
is
in
the
Palazzo
de
Pitti
,
at
Florence
;
and
the
death
of
Germanicus
,
by
Poussin
,
which
I
take
to
be
one
of
the
best
pieces
in
this
great
collection
.
<EOS>
In
the
Palazzo
Falconeri
there
is
a
beautiful
St
Cecilia
,
by
Guercino
;
a
holy
family
,
by
Raphael
;
and
a
fine
expressive
figure
of
St
Peter
weeping
,
by
Dominechino
.
<EOS>
In
the
Palazzo
Altieri
,
I
admired
a
picture
,
by
Carlo
Maratti
,
representing
a
saint
calling
down
lightning
from
heaven
to
destroy
blasphemers
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
figure
of
the
saint
I
admired
,
merely
as
a
portrait
.
<EOS>
The
execution
of
the
other
parts
was
tame
enough
:
perhaps
they
were
purposely
kept
down
,
in
order
to
preserve
the
importance
of
the
principal
figure
.
<EOS>
I
imagine
Salvator
Rosa
would
have
made
a
different
disposition
on
the
same
subject
:
that
amidst
the
darkness
of
a
tempest
,
he
would
have
illuminated
the
blasphemer
with
the
flash
of
lightning
by
which
he
was
destroyed
:
this
would
have
thrown
a
dismal
gleam
upon
his
countenance
,
distorted
by
the
horror
of
his
situation
as
well
as
by
the
effects
of
the
fire
;
and
rendered
the
whole
scene
dreadfully
picturesque
.
<EOS>
In
the
same
palace
,
I
saw
the
famous
holy
family
,
by
Corregio
,
which
he
left
unfinished
,
and
no
other
artist
would
undertake
to
supply
;
for
what
reason
I
know
not
.
<EOS>
Here
too
is
a
judgment
of
Paris
,
by
Titian
,
which
is
reckoned
a
very
valuable
piece
.
<EOS>
In
the
Palazzo
Odescalchi
,
there
is
a
holy
family
,
by
Buonaroti
,
and
another
by
Raphael
,
both
counted
excellent
,
though
in
very
different
stiles
,
extremely
characteristic
of
those
two
great
rival
artists
.
  
<EOS>
If
I
was
silly
enough
to
make
a
parade
,
I
might
mention
some
hundreds
more
of
marbles
and
pictures
,
which
I
really
saw
at
Rome
;
and
even
eke
out
that
number
with
a
huge
list
of
those
I
did
not
see
:
but
whatever
vanity
I
may
have
,
it
has
not
taken
this
turn
;
and
I
assure
you
,
upon
my
word
and
honour
,
I
have
described
nothing
<EOS>
but
what
actually
fell
under
my
own
observation
.
<EOS>
As
for
my
critical
remarks
,
I
am
afraid
you
will
think
them
too
superficial
and
capricious
to
belong
to
any
other
person
<EOS>
but
 
<EOS>
Your
humble

NICE
,
April
2
,
1765
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
I
have
nothing
to
communicate
touching
the
library
of
the
Vatican
,
which
,
with
respect
to
the
apartments
and
their
ornaments
,
is
undoubtedly
magnificent
.
<EOS>
The
number
of
books
it
contains
does
not
exceed
forty
thousand
volumes
,
which
are
all
concealed
from
the
view
,
and
locked
up
in
presses
:
as
for
the
manuscripts
,
I
saw
none
but
such
as
are
commonly
presented
to
strangers
of
our
nation
;
some
very
old
copies
of
Virgil
and
Terence
;
two
or
three
Missals
,
curiously
illuminated
;
the
book
De
Septem
Sacramentis
,
written
in
Latin
by
Henry
VIII
against
Luther
;
and
some
of
that
prince
's
love
letters
to
Anne
Boleyn
.
<EOS>
I
likewise
visited
the
Libreria
Casanatense
,
belonging
to
the
convent
of
the
church
called
S
Maria
Sopra
Minerva
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
recommendation
to
the
principal
librarian
,
a
Dominican
friar
,
who
received
me
very
politely
,
and
regaled
me
with
a
sight
of
several
curious
MSS
of
the
classics
.
  
<EOS>
Having
satisfied
my
curiosity
at
Rome
,
I
prepared
for
my
departure
,
and
as
the
road
between
Radicofani
and
Montefiascone
is
very
stony
and
disagreeable
,
I
asked
the
banker
Barazzi
,
if
there
was
not
a
better
way
of
returning
to
Florence
,
expressing
a
desire
at
the
same
time
to
see
the
cascade
of
Terni
.
<EOS>
He
assured
me
that
the
road
by
Terni
was
forty
miles
shorter
than
the
other
,
much
more
safe
and
easy
,
and
accommodated
with
exceeding
good
auberges
.
<EOS>
Had
I
taken
the
trouble
to
cast
my
eyes
upon
the
map
<EOS>
,
I
must
have
seen
,
that
the
road
by
Terni
,
instead
of
being
forty
miles
shorter
,
was
much
longer
than
the
other
:
<EOS>
but
this
was
not
the
only
mistake
of
Signiore
Barazzi
.
<EOS>
Great
part
of
this
way
lies
over
steep
mountains
,
or
along
the
side
of
precipices
,
which
render
travelling
in
a
carriage
exceeding
tedious
,
dreadful
,
and
dangerous
;
and
as
for
the
public
houses
,
they
are
in
all
respects
the
most
execrable
that
ever
I
entered
.
<EOS>
I
will
venture
to
say
that
a
common
prisoner
in
the
Marshalsea
or
King's
-
Bench
is
more
cleanly
and
commodiously
lodged
than
we
were
in
many
places
on
this
road
.
<EOS>
The
houses
are
abominably
nasty
,
and
generally
destitute
of
provision
:
when
eatables
were
found
,
we
were
almost
poisoned
by
their
cookery
:
their
beds
were
without
curtains
or
bedstead
,
and
their
windows
without
glass
;
and
for
this
sort
of
entertainment
we
payed
as
much
as
if
we
had
been
genteelly
lodged
,
and
sumptuously
treated
.
<EOS>
I
repeat
it
again
;
of
all
the
people
I
ever
knew
,
the
Italians
are
the
most
villainously
rapacious
.
<EOS>
The
first
day
,
having
passed
Civita
Castellana
,
a
small
town
standing
on
the
top
of
a
hill
,
we
put
up
at
what
was
called
an
excellent
inn
,
where
cardinals
,
prelates
,
and
princes
,
often
lodged
.
<EOS>
Being
meagre
day
,
there
was
nothing
but
bread
,
eggs
,
and
anchovies
,
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
went
to
bed
without
supper
,
and
lay
in
a
pallet
,
where
I
was
half
devoured
by
vermin
.
<EOS>
Next
day
,
our
road
,
in
some
places
,
lay
along
precipices
,
which
over
-
hang
the
Nera
or
Nar
,
celebrated
in
antiquity
for
its
white
foam
,
and
the
sulphureous
quality
of
its
waters
.
  
<EOS>
Sulfurea
nar
albus
aqua
,
fontesque
velini
.
  
<EOS>
Sulphureous
nar
,
and
the
Velinian
streams
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
a
small
,
but
rapid
stream
,
which
runs
not
far
from
hence
,
into
the
Tyber
.
<EOS>
Passing
Utricoli
,
near
the
ruins
of
the
ancient
Ocriculum
,
and
the
romantic
town
of
Narni
,
situated
on
the
top
of
a
mountain
,
in
the
neighbourhood
of
which
is
still
seen
standing
one
arch
of
the
stupendous
bridge
built
by
Augustus
Caesar
<EOS>
,
we
arrived
at
Terni
,
and
hiring
a
couple
of
chaises
before
dinner
,
went
to
see
the
famous
Cascata
delle
Marmore
,
which
is
at
the
distance
of
three
miles
.
<EOS>
We
ascended
a
steep
mountain
by
a
narrow
road
formed
for
a
considerable
way
along
the
brink
of
a
precipice
,
at
the
bottom
of
which
brawls
the
furious
river
Nera
,
after
having
received
the
Velino
.
<EOS>
This
last
is
the
stream
which
,
running
from
the
Lago
delle
Marmore
,
forms
the
cascade
by
falling
over
a
precipice
about
one
hundred
and
sixty
feet
high
.
<EOS>
Such
a
body
of
water
rushing
down
the
mountain
;
the
smoak
,
vapour
,
and
thick
white
mist
which
it
raises
;
the
double
rainbow
which
these
particles
continually
exhibit
while
the
sun
shines
;
the
deafening
sound
of
the
cataract
;
the
vicinity
of
a
great
number
of
other
stupendous
rocks
and
precipices
,
with
the
dashing
,
boiling
,
and
foaming
of
the
two
rivers
below
,
produce
altogether
an
object
of
tremendous
sublimity
:
yet
great
part
of
its
effect
is
lost
,
for
want
of
a
proper
point
of
view
,
from
which
it
might
be
contemplated
.
<EOS>
The
cascade
would
appear
much
more
astonishing
,
were
it
not
in
some
measure
eclipsed
by
the
superior
height
of
the
neighbouring
mountains
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
a
front
perspective
;
but
are
obliged
to
view
it
obliquely
on
one
side
,
standing
upon
the
brink
of
a
precipice
,
which
can
not
be
approached
without
horror
.
<EOS>
This
station
might
be
rendered
much
more
accessible
,
and
altogether
secure
,
for
the
expence
of
four
or
five
zequines
;
and
a
small
tax
might
be
levied
for
the
purpose
from
travellers
by
the
aubergiste
at
Terni
,
who
lets
his
calasses
for
half
a
zequine
a
piece
to
those
that
are
curious
to
see
this
phaenomenon
.
<EOS>
Besides
the
two
postilions
whom
I
payed
for
this
excursion
,
at
the
rate
of
one
stage
in
posting
,
there
was
a
fellow
who
posted
himself
behind
one
of
the
chaises
,
by
way
of
going
to
point
out
the
different
views
of
the
cascade
;
and
his
demand
amounted
to
four
or
five
pauls
.
<EOS>
To
give
you
an
idea
of
the
extortion
of
those
villainous
publicans
,
I
must
tell
you
that
for
a
dinner
and
supper
,
which
even
hunger
could
not
tempt
us
to
eat
,
and
a
night
's
lodging
in
three
truckle
beds
<EOS>
,
I
paid
eighty
pauls
,
amounting
to
forty
shillings
sterling
.
<EOS>
You
ask
me
why
I
submitted
to
such
imposition
?
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
 
I
have
more
than
once
in
my
travels
made
a
formal
complaint
of
the
exorbitancy
of
a
publican
,
to
the
magistrate
of
the
place
;
but
I
never
received
any
satisfaction
,
and
have
lost
abundance
of
time
.
<EOS>
Had
I
proceeded
to
manual
correction
,
I
should
have
alarmed
and
terrified
the
women
:
had
I
peremptorily
refused
to
pay
the
sum
total
,
the
landlord
,
who
was
the
post
-
master
,
would
not
have
supplied
me
with
horses
to
proceed
on
my
journey
.
<EOS>
I
tried
the
experiment
at
Muy
in
France
,
where
I
put
myself
into
a
violent
passion
,
had
abundance
of
trouble
,
was
detained
till
it
was
almost
night
,
and
after
all
found
myself
obliged
to
submit
,
furnishing
at
the
same
time
matter
of
infinite
triumph
to
the
mob
,
which
had
surrounded
the
coach
,
and
interested
themselves
warmly
in
favour
of
their
townsman
.
<EOS>
If
some
young
patriot
,
in
good
health
and
spirits
,
would
take
the
trouble
as
often
as
he
is
imposed
upon
by
the
road
in
travelling
,
to
have
recourse
to
the
fountain
-
head
,
and
prefer
a
regular
complaint
to
the
comptroller
of
the
posts
,
either
in
France
or
Italy

Terni
is
an
agreeable
town
,
pretty
well
built
,
and
situated
in
a
pleasant
valley
,
between
two
branches
of
the
river
Nera
,
whence
it
was
called
by
the
antients
,
Interamna
.
<EOS>
Here
is
an
agreeable
piazza
,
where
stands
a
church
that
was
of
old
a
heathen
temple
.
<EOS>
There
are
some
valuable
paintings
in
the
church
.
<EOS>
The
people
are
said
to
be
very
civil
,
and
provisions
to
be
extremely
cheap

It
was
the
birthplace
of
the
emperor
Tacitus
,
as
well
as
of
the
historian
of
the
same

<EOS>
In
our
journey
from
hence
to
Spoleto
,
we
passed
over
a
high
mountain
,
(
called
,
from
its
height
,
Somma
)
<EOS>
where
it
was
necessary
to
have
two
additional
horses
to
the
carriage
,
and
the
road
winds
along
a
precipice
.
<EOS>
which
is
equally
dangerous
and
dreadful
.
<EOS>
We
passed
through
part
of
Spoleto
,
the
capital
of
Umbria
,
which
is
a
pretty
large
city
.
<EOS>
Of
this
,
however
,
I
give
no
other
account
from
my
own
observation
,
but
that
I
saw
at
a
distance
the
famous
Gothic
aqueduct
of
brick
:
this
is
mentioned
by
Addison
as
a
structure
,
which
,
for
the
height
of
its
arches
,
is
not
equalled
by
any
thing
in
Europe
.
<EOS>
The
road
from
hence
to
Foligno
,
where
we
lay
,
is
kept
in
good
order
,
and
lies
through
a
delightful
plain
,
laid
out
into
beautiful
inclosures
,
abounding
with
wine
,
oil
,
corn
,
and
cattle
,
and
watered
by
the
pastoral
streams
of
the
famous
river
Clitumnus
,
which
takes
its
rise
in
three
or
four
separate
rivulets
issuing
from
a
rock
near
the
highway
.
<EOS>
On
the
right
-
hand
,
we
saw
several
towns
situated
on
rising
grounds
,
and
among
the
rest
,
that
of
Assissio
,
famous
for
the
birth
of
St
Francis
,
whose
body
,
being
here
deposited
,
occasions
a
concourse
of
pilgrims
.
<EOS>
We
met
a
Roman
princess
going
thither
with
a
grand
retinue
,
in
consequence
of
a
vow
she
had
made
for
the
re
-
establishment
of
her
health
.
<EOS>
Foligno
,
the
Fulginium
of
the
antients
,
is
a
small
town
,
not
unpleasant
,
lying
in
the
midst
of
mulberry
plantations
,
vineyards
,
and
corn
-
fields
,
and
built
on
both
sides
of
the
little
river
Topino
.
<EOS>
In
choosing
our
beds
at
the
inn
,
I
perceived
one
chamber
locked
,
and
desired
it
might
be
opened
;
upon
which
the
cameriere
declared
with
some
reluctance
,
"
Besogna
dire
a
su

eccellenza
;
poco
fa
,
che

morta

"
Your
Excellency
must
know
that
a
filthy
Beast
died
lately
in
that
Chamber
,
and
it
is
not
yet
purified
and
put
in
order
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
When
I
enquired
what
beast
it
was
,
he
replied
,
"
<EOS>
Un'eretico
Inglese
,
"
"
An
English
heretic
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
would
not
have
made
so
free
with
our
country
and
religion
,
if
he
had
not
taken
us
for
German
catholics
,
as
we
afterwards
learned
from
Mr
R
 
i.
<EOS>
Next
day
,
we
crossed
the
Tyber
,
over
a
handsome
bridge
,
and
in
mounting
the
steep
hill
upon
which
the
city
of
Perugia
stands
,
our
horses
being
exhausted
,
were
dragged
backwards
by
the
weight
of
the
carriage
to
the
very
edge
of
a
precipice
,
where
,
happily
for
us
,
a
man
passing
that
way
,
placed
a
large
stone
behind
one
of
the
wheels
,
which
stopped
their
motion
,
otherwise
we
should
have
been
all
dashed
in
pieces
.
<EOS>
We
had
another
ugly
hill
to
ascend
within
the
city
,
which
was
more
difficult
and
dangerous
than
the
other
:
but
the
postilions
,
and
the
other
beasts
made
such
efforts
,
that
we
mounted
without
the
least
stop
,
to
the
summit
,
where
we
found
ourselves
in
a
large
piazza
,
where
the
horses
are
always
changed
.
<EOS>
There
being
no
relays
at
the
post
,
we
were
obliged
to
stay
the
whole
day
and
night
at
Perugia
,
which
is
a
considerable
city
,
built
upon
the
acclivity
of
a
hill
,
adorned
with
some
elegant
fountains
,
and
several
handsome
churches
,
containing
some
valuable
pictures
by
Guido
,
Raphael
,
and
his
master
Pietro
Perugino
,
who
was
a
native
of
this
place
.
<EOS>
The
next
stage
is
on
the
banks
of
the
lake
,
which
was
the
Thrasimene
of
the
antients
,
a
beautiful
piece
of
water
,
above
thirty
miles
in
circumference
,
having
three
islands
,
abounding
with
excellent
fish
:
upon
a
peninsula
of
it
,
there
is
a
town
and
castle
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
this
neighbourhood
where
the
consul
Flaminius
was
totally
defeated
with
great
slaughter
by
Hannibal
.
<EOS>
From
Perugia
to
Florence
,
the
posts
are
all
double
,
and
the
road
is
so
bad
that
we
never
could
travel
above
eight
and
twenty
miles
a
day
.
<EOS>
We
were
often
obliged
to
quit
the
carriage
,
and
walk
up
steep
mountains
;
and
the
way
in
general
was
so
unequal
and
stony
,
that
we
were
jolted
even
to
the
danger
of
our
lives
.
<EOS>
I
never
felt
any
sort
of
exercise
or
fatigue
so
intolerable
;
and
I
did
not
fail
to
bestow
an
hundred
benedictions
per
diem
upon
the
banker
Barazzi
,
by
whose
advice
we
had
taken
this
road
;
yet
there
was
no
remedy
but
patience
.
<EOS>
If
the
coach
had
not
been
incredibly
strong
,
it
must
have
been
shattered
to
pieces
.
<EOS>
The
fifth
night
we
passed
at
a
place
called
Camoccia
,
a
miserable
cabaret
,
where
we
were
fain
to
cook
our
own
supper
,
and
lay
in
a
musty
chamber
,
which
had
never
known
a
fire
,
and
indeed
had
no
fire
-
place
,
and
where
we
ran
the
risque
of
being
devoured
by
rats
.
<EOS>
Next
day
one
of
the
irons
of
the
coach
gave
way
at
Arezzo
,
where
we
were
detained
two
hours
before
it
could
be
accommodated
.
<EOS>
I
might
have
taken
this
opportunity
to
view
the
remains
of
the
antient
Etruscan
amphitheatre
.
<EOS>
and
the
temple
of
Hercules
,
described
by
the
cavalier
Lorenzo
Guazzesi
,
as
standing
in
the
neighbourhood
of
this
place
:
but
the
blacksmith
assured
me
his
work
would
be
finished
in
a
few
minutes
;
and
as
I
had
nothing
so
much
at
heart
as
the
speedy
accomplishment
of
this
disagreeable
journey
,
I
chose
to
suppress
my
curiosity
,
rather
than
be
the
occasion
of
a
moment
's
delay
.
<EOS>
But
all
the
nights
we
had
hitherto
passed
were
comfortable
in
comparison
to
this
,
which
we
suffered
at
a
small
village
,
the
name
of
which
I
do
not
remember
.
<EOS>
The
house
was
dismal
and
dirty
beyond
all
description
;
the
bed
-
cloaths
filthy
enough
to
turn
the
stomach
of
a
muleteer
;
and
the
victuals
cooked
in
such
a
manner
,
that
even
a
Hottentot
could
not
have
beheld
them
without
loathing
.
<EOS>
We
had
sheets
of
our
own
,
which
were
spread
upon
a
mattrass
,
and
here
I
took
my
repose
wrapped
in
a
greatcoat
,
if
that
could
be
called
repose
which
was
interrupted
by
the
innumerable
stings
of
vermin
.
<EOS>
In
the
morning
,
I
was
seized
with
a
dangerous
fit
of
hooping
-
cough
,
which
terrified
my
wife
,
alarmed
my
people
,
and
brought
the
whole
community
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
had
undergone
just
such
another
at
Paris
,
about
a
year
before
.
<EOS>
This
forenoon
,
one
of
our
coach
wheels
flew
off
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Ancisa
,
a
small
town
,
where
we
were
detained
above
two
hours
by
this
accident
;
a
delay
which
was
productive
of
much
disappointment
,
danger
,
vexation
,
and
fatigue
.
<EOS>
There
being
no
horses
at
the
last
post
,
we
were
obliged
to
wait
until
those
which
brought
us
thither
were
sufficiently
refreshed
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
Understanding
that
all
the
gates
of
Florence
are
shut
at
six
,
except
two
that
are
kept
open
for
the
accommodation
of
travellers
;
and
that
to
reach
the
nearest
of
these
gates
,
it
was
necessary
to
pass
the
river
Arno
in
a
ferry
-
boat
,
which
could
not
transport
the
carriage
;
I
determined
to
send
my
servant
before
with
a
light
chaise
to
enter
the
nearest
gate
before
it
was
shut
,
and
provide
a
coach
to
come
and
take
us
up
at
the
side
of
the
river
,
where
we
should
be
obliged
to
pass
in
the
boat
:
for
I
could
not
bear
the
thoughts
of
lying
another
night
in
a
common
cabaret
.
<EOS>
Here
,
however
,
another
difficulty
occurred
.
<EOS>
There
was
but
one
chaise
,
and
a
dragoon
officer
,
in
the
imperial
troops
,
insisted
upon
his
having
bespoke
it
for
himself
and
his
servant
.
<EOS>
A
long
dispute
ensued
,
which
had
like
to
have
produced
a
quarrel
:
but
at
length
I
accommodated
matters
,
by
telling
the
officer
that
he
should
have
a
place
in
it
gratis
,
and
his
servant
might
ride
a
-
horse
-
back
.
<EOS>
He
accepted
the
offer
without
hesitation
;
but
,
in
the
mean
time
,
we
set
out
in
the
coach
before
them
,
and
having
proceeded
about
a
couple
of
miles
,
the
road
was
so
deep
from
a
heavy
rain
,
and
the
beasts
were
so
fatigued
,
that
they
could
not
proceed
.
<EOS>
The
postilions
scourging
the
poor
animals
with
great
barbarity
,
they
made
an
effort
,
and
pulled
the
coach
to
the
brink
of
a
precipice
,
or
rather
a
kind
of
hollow
-
way
,
which
might
be
about
seven
or
eight
feet
lower
than
the
road
.
<EOS>
Here
my
wife
and
I
leaped
out
,
and
stood
under
the
rain
up
to
the
ancles
in
mud
;
while
the
postilions
still
exercising
their
whips
,
one
of
the
fore
-
horses
fairly
tumbled
down
the
descent
,
arid
hung
by
the
neck
,
so
that
he
was
almost
strangled
before
he
could
be
disengaged
from
the
traces
,
by
the
assistance
of
some
foot
travellers
that
happened
to
pass
.
<EOS>
While
we
remained
in
this
dilemma
,
the
chaise
,
with
the
officer
and
my
servant
,
coming
up
,
we
exchanged
places
;
my
wife
and
I
proceeded
in
the
chaise
,
and
left
them
with
Miss
C
  
and
Mr
R
 
,
to
follow
in
the
coach
.
<EOS>
The
road
from
hence
to
Florence
is
nothing
but
a
succession
of
steep
mountains
,
paved
and
conducted
in
such
a
manner
,
that
one
would
imagine
the
design
had
been
to
render
it
impracticable
by
any
sort
of
wheel
-
carriage
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
all
our
endeavours
,
I
found
it
would
be
impossible
to
enter
Florence
before
the
gates
were
shut
.
<EOS>
I
flattered
and
threatened
the
driver
by
turns
:
but
the
fellow
,
who
had
been
remarkably
civil
at
first
,
grew
sullen
and
impertinent
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
I
must
not
think
of
reaching
Florence
:
that
the
boat
would
not
take
the
carriage
on
board
;
and
that
from
the
other
side
,
I
must
walk
five
miles
before
I
should
reach
the
gate
that
was
open
:
but
he
would
carry
me
to
an
excellent
osteria
,
where
I
should
be
entertained
and
lodged
like
a
prince
.
<EOS>
I
was
now
convinced
that
he
had
lingered
on
purpose
to
serve
this
inn
-
keeper
;
and
I
took
it
for
granted
that
what
he
told
me
of
the
distance
between
the
ferry
and
the
gate
was
a
lie
.
<EOS>
It
was
eight
o'clock
when
we
arrived
at
his
inn
.
<EOS>
I
alighted
with
my
wife
to
view
the
chambers
,
desiring
he
would
not
put
up
his
horses
.
<EOS>
Finding
it
was
a
villainous
house
,
we
came
forth
,
and
,
by
this
time
,
the
horses
were
put
up
.
<EOS>
I
asked
the
fellow
how
he
durst
presume
to
contradict
my
orders
,
and
commanded
him
to
put
them
to
the
chaise
.
<EOS>
He
asked
in
his
turn
if
I
was
mad
?
<EOS>
If
I
thought
I
and
the
lady
had
strength
and
courage
enough
to
walk
five
miles
in
the
dark
,
through
a
road
which
we
did
not
know
,
and
which
was
broke
up
by
a
continued
rain
of
two
days
?
<EOS>
I
told
him
he
was
an
impertinent
rascal
,
and
as
he
still
hesitated
,
I
collared
him
with
one
hand
,
and
shook
my
cane
over
his
head
with
the
other
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
only
weapon
I
had
,
either
offensive
or
defensive
;
for
I
had
left
my
sword
,
and
musquetoon
in
the
coach
.
<EOS>
At
length
the
fellow
obeyed
,
though
with
great
reluctance
,
cracking
many
severe
jokes
upon
us
in
the
mean
time
,
and
being
joined
in
his
raillery
by
the
inn
-
keeper
,
who
had
all
the
external
marks
of
a
ruffian
.
<EOS>
The
house
stood
in
a
solitary
situation
,
and
not
a
soul
appeared
but
these
two
miscreants
,
so
that
they
might
have
murdered
us
without
fear
of
detection
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
like
the
apartments
?
<EOS>
(
said
one
)
to
be
sure
they
were
not
fitted
up
for
persons
of
your
rank
and
quality
!
"
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
glad
of
a
worse
chamber
,
(
continued
the
other
)
before
you
get
to
bed
.
"
<EOS>
"
If
you
walk
to
Florence
tonight
,
you
will
sleep
so
sound
,
that
the
fleas
will
not
disturb
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
Take
care
<EOS>
you
do
not
take
up
your
night
's
lodging
in
the
middle
of
the
road
,
or
in
the
ditch
of
the
city
-
wall
.
<EOS>
"
I
fired
inwardly
at
these
sarcasms
,
to
which
,
however
,
I
made
no
reply
;
and
my
wife
was
almost
dead
with
fear
.
<EOS>
In
the
road
from
hence
to
the
boat
,
we
met
with
an
ill
-
looking
fellow
,
who
offered
his
service
to
conduct
us
into
the
city
,
and
such
was
our
situation
,
that
I
was
fain
to
accept
his
proposal
,
especially
as
we
had
two
small
boxes
in
the
chaise
by
accident
,
containing
some
caps
and
laces
belonging
to
my
wife
<EOS>
,
I
still
hoped
the
postilion
had
exaggerated
in
the
distance
between
the
boat
and
the
city
gate
,
and
was
confirmed
in
this
opinion
by
the
ferryman
,
who
said
we
had
not
above
half
a
league
to
walk
.
<EOS>
Behold
us
then
in
this
expedition
;
myself
wrapped
up
in
a
very
heavy
greatcoat
,
and
my
cane
in
my
hand
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
imagine
I
could
have
walked
a
couple
of
miles
in
this
equipage
,
had
my
life
been
depending
;
my
wife
a
delicate
creature
,
who
had
scarce
ever
walked
a
mile
in
her
life
;
and
the
ragamuffin
before
us
with
our
boxes
under
his
arm
.
<EOS>
The
night
was
dark
and
wet
;
the
road
slippery
and
dirty
;
not
a
soul
was
seen
,
nor
a
sound
was
heard
:
all
was
silent
,
dreary
,
and
horrible
.
<EOS>
I
laid
my
account
with
a
violent
fit
of
illness
from
the
cold
<EOS>
I
should
infallibly
catch
,
if
I
escaped
assassination
,
the
fears
of
which
were
the
more
troublesome
as
I
had
no
weapon
to
defend
our
lives
.
<EOS>
While
I
laboured
under
the
weight
of
my
greatcoat
which
made
the
streams
of
sweat
flow
down
my
face
and
shoulders
,
I
was
plunging
in
the
mud
,
up
to
the
mid
-
leg
at
every
step
;
and
at
the
same
time
obliged
to
support
my
wife
,
who
wept
in
silence
,
half
dead
with
terror
and
fatigue
.
<EOS>
To
crown
our
vexation
,
our
conductor
walked
so
fast
,
that
he
was
often
out
of
sight
,
and
I
imagined
he
had
run
away
with
the
boxes
.
<EOS>
All
I
could
do
on
these
occasions
,
was
to
hollow
as
loud
as
I
could
,
and
swear
horribly
that
I
would
blow
his
brains
out
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
know
but
these
oaths
and
menaces
might
keep
other
rogues
in
awe
.
<EOS>
In
this
manner
did
we
travel
three
long
miles
,
making
almost
an
intire
circuit
of
the
city
-
wall
,
without
seeing
the
face
of
a
human
creature
,
and
at
length
reached
the
gate
,
where
we
were
examined
by
the
guard
,
and
allowed
to
pass
,
after
they
had
told
us
it
was
a
long
mile
from
thence
to
the
house
of
Vanini
,
where
we
proposed
to
lodge
.
<EOS>
No
matter
,
being
now
fairly
within
the
city
,
I
plucked
up
my
spirits
,
and
performed
the
rest
of
the
journey
with
such
ease
,
that
I
am
persuaded
,
I
could
have
walked
at
the
same
pace
all
night
long
,
without
being
very
much
fatigued
.
<EOS>
It
was
near
ten
at
night
,
when
we
entered
the
auberge
in
such
a
draggled
and
miserable
condition
,
that
Mrs
Vanini
almost
fainted
at
sight
of
us
,
on
the
supposition
that
we
had
met
with
some
terrible
disaster
,
and
that
the
rest
of
the
company
were
killed
.
<EOS>
My
wife
and
I
were
immediately
accommodated
with
dry
stockings
and
shoes
,
a
warm
apartment
,
and
a
good
supper
,
which
I
ate
with
great
satisfaction
,
arising
not
only
from
our
having
happily
survived
the
adventure
,
but
also
from
a
conviction
that
my
strength
and
constitution
were
wonderfully
repaired
:
<EOS>
not
but
that
I
still
expected
a
severe
cold
,
attended
with
a
terrible
fit
of
the
asthma
:
<EOS>
but
in
this
I
was
luckily
disappointed
.
<EOS>
I
now
for
the
first
time
drank
to
the
health
of
my
physician
Barazzi
,
fully
persuaded
that
the
hardships
and
violent
exercise
I
underwent
by
following
his
advice
,
had
greatly
contributed
to
the
re
-
establishment
of
my
health
.
<EOS>
In
this
particular
,
I
imitate
the
gratitude
of
Tavernier
,
who
was
radically
cured
of
the
gout
by
a
Turkish
aga
in
Aegypt
,
who
gave
him
the
bastinado
,
because
he
would
not
look
at
the
head
of
the
bashaw
of
Cairo
,
which
the
aga
had
in
a
bag
,
to
be
presented
to
the
grand
signior
at
Constantinople
.
  
<EOS>
I
did
not
expect
to
see
the
rest
of
our
company
that
night
,
as
I
never
doubted
but
they
would
stay
with
the
coach
at
the
inn
on
the
other
side
of
the
Arno
:
but
at
mid
-
night
we
were
joined
by
Miss
C
  
and
Mr
R
 
,
who
had
left
the
carriage
at
the
inn
,
under
the
auspices
of
the
captain
and
my
servant
,
and
followed
our
foot
-
steps
by
walking
from
the
ferry
-
boat
to
Florence
,
conducted
by
one
of
the
boatmen
.
<EOS>
Mr
R
  
seemed
to
be
much
ruffled
and
chagrined
;
but
,
as
he
did
not
think
proper
to
explain
the
cause
,
he
had
no
right
to
expect
that
I
should
give
him
satisfaction
for
some
insult
he
had
received
from
my
servant
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
exposed
to
a
variety
of
disagreeable
adventures
from
the
impracticability
of
the
road
.
<EOS>
The
coach
had
been
several
times
in
the
most
imminent
hazard
of
being
lost
with
all
our
baggage
;
and
at
one
place
,
it
was
necessary
to
hire
a
dozen
of
oxen
,
and
as
many
men
,
to
disengage
it
from
the
holes
into
which
it
had
run
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
the
confusion
of
these
adventures
,
that
the
captain
and
his
valet
,
Mr
R
  
and
my
servant
,
had
like
to
have
gone
all
by
the
ears
together
.
<EOS>
The
peace
was
with
difficulty
preserved
by
the
interposition
of
Miss
C
 
,
who
suffered
incredibly
from
cold
and
wet
,
terror
,
vexation
,
and
fatigue
:
yet
happily
no
bad
consequence
ensued
.
<EOS>
The
coach
and
baggage
were
brought
safely
into
Florence
next
morning
,
when
all
of
us
found
ourselves
well
refreshed
,
and
in
good
spirits
.
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
this
is
not
the
case
with
you
,
who
must
by
this
time
be
quite
jaded
with
this
long
epistle
,
which
shall
therefore
be
closed
without
further
ceremony
by
,
 
Yours
always
.

NICE

<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
<EOS>
The
season
being
far
advanced
,
and
the
weather
growing
boisterous
,
I
made
but
a
short
stay
at
Florence
,
and
set
out
for
Pisa
,
with
full
resolution
to
take
the
nearest
road
to
Lerici
,
where
we
proposed
to
hire
a
felucca
for
Genoa
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
great
desire
to
see
Leghorn
and
Lucca
;
but
the
dread
of
a
winter
's
voyage
by
sea
in
an
open
boat
effectually
restrained
my
curiosity
.
<EOS>
To
avoid
the
trouble
of
having
our
baggage
shifted
every
post
,
I
hired
two
chaises
to
Pisa
for
a
couple
of
zequines
,
and
there
we
arrived
in
safety
about
seven
in
the
evening
,
though
not
without
fear
of
the
consequence
,
as
the
calesses
were
quite
open
,
and
it
rained
all
the
way
.
<EOS>
I
must
own
<EOS>
I
was
so
sick
of
the
wretched
accommodation
<EOS>
one
meets
with
in
every
part
of
Italy
,
except
the
great
cities
,
so
averse
to
the
sea
at
this
season
,
and
so
fond
of
the
city
of
Pisa
,
that
I
should
certainly
have
stayed
here
the
winter
,
<EOS>
had
not
I
been
separated
from
my
books
and
papers
,
as
well
as
from
other
conveniencies
and
connexions
which
I
had
at
Nice
;
and
foreseen
that
the
thoughts
of
performing
the
same
disagreeable
voyage
in
the
spring
would
imbitter
my
whole
winter
's
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
I
again
hired
two
calesses
for
Lerici
,
proposing
to
lie
at
Sarzana
,
three
miles
short
of
that
place
,
where
we
were
told
we
should
find
comfortable
lodging
,
and
to
embark
next
day
without
halting
.
<EOS>
When
we
departed
in
the
morning
,
it
rained
very
hard
,
and
the
Cerchio
,
which
the
chaises
had
formerly
passed
,
almost
without
wetting
the
wheels
,
was
now
swelled
to
a
mighty
river
,
broad
and
deep
and
rapid
.
<EOS>
It
was
with
great
difficulty
I
could
persuade
my
wife
to
enter
the
boat
;
for
it
blew
a
storm
,
and
she
had
seen
it
in
coming
over
from
the
other
side
hurried
down
a
considerable
way
by
the
rapidity
of
the
current
,
notwithstanding
all
the
efforts
of
the
watermen
.
<EOS>
Near
two
hours
were
spent
in
transporting
us
with
our
chaises
.
<EOS>
The
road
between
this
and
Pietra
Santa
was
rendered
almost
impassable
.
<EOS>
When
we
arrived
at
Massa
,
it
began
to
grow
dark
,
and
the
post
-
master
assured
us
that
the
road
to
Sarzana
was
overflowed
in
such
a
manner
as
not
to
be
passed
even
in
the
day
-
time
,
without
imminent
danger
.
<EOS>
We
therefore
took
up
our
lodging
for
the
night
at
this
house
,
which
was
in
all
respects
one
of
the
worst
we
had
yet
entered
.
<EOS>
Next
day
,
we
found
the
Magra
as
large
and
violent
as
the
Cerchio
:
however
,
we
passed
it
without
any
accident
,
and
in
the
afternoon
arrived
at
Lerici
.
<EOS>
There
we
were
immediately
besieged
by
a
number
of
patrons
of
feluccas
,
from
among
whom
I
chose
a
Spaniard
,
partly
because
he
looked
like
an
honest
man
,
and
produced
an
ample
certificate
,
signed
by
an
English
gentleman
;
and
partly
,
because
he
was
not
an
Italian
;
for
,
by
this
time
,
I
had
imbibed
a
strong
prejudice
against
the
common
people
of
that
country
.
<EOS>
We
embarked
in
the
morning
before
day
,
with
a
gale
that
made
us
run
the
lee
-
gunwale
in
the
water
;
but
,
when
we
pretended
to
turn
the
point
of
Porto
Venere
,
we
found
the
wind
full
in
our
teeth
,
and
were
obliged
to
return
to
our
quarters
,
where
we
had
been
shamefully
fleeced
by
the
landlord
,
who
,
nevertheless
,
was
not
such
an
exorbitant
knave
as
the
post
-
master
,
whose
house
I
would
advise
all
travellers
to
avoid
.
<EOS>
Here
,
indeed
,
I
had
occasion
to
see
an
instance
of
prudence
and
oeconomy
,
which
I
should
certainly
imitate
,
if
ever
I
had
occasion
to
travel
this
way
by
myself
.
<EOS>
An
Englishman
,
who
had
hired
a
felucca
from
Antibes
to
Leghorn
,
was
put
in
here
by
stress
of
weather
;
but
being
aware
of
the
extortion
of
innkeepers
,
and
the
bad
accommodation
in
their
houses
,
he
slept
on
board
on
his
own
mattrasses
;
and
there
likewise
he
had
all
his
conveniencies
for
eating
.
<EOS>
He
sent
his
servant
on
shore
occasionally
to
buy
provision
,
and
see
it
cooked
according
to
his
direction
in
some
public
house
;
and
had
his
meals
regularly
in
the
felucca
.
<EOS>
This
evening
he
came
ashore
to
stretch
his
legs
,
and
took
a
solitary
walk
on
the
beach
,
avoiding
us
with
great
care
,
although
he
knew
we
were
English
;
his
valet
who
was
abundantly
communicative
,
told
my
servant
,
that
in
coming
through
France
,
his
master
had
travelled
three
days
in
company
with
two
other
English
gentlemen
,
whom
he
met
upon
the
road
,
and
in
all
that
time
he
never
spoke
a
word
to
either
,
yet
in
other
respects
,
he
was
a
good
man
,
mild
,
charitable
,
and
humane
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
character
truly
British
.
<EOS>
At
five
o'clock
in
the
morning
we
put
to
sea
again
,
and
though
the
wind
was
contrary
,
made
shift
to
reach
the
town
of
Sestri
di
Levante
,
where
we
were
most
graciously
received
by
the
publican
butcher
and
his
family
.
<EOS>
The
house
was
in
much
better
order
than
before
;
the
people
were
much
more
obliging
;
we
passed
a
very
tolerable
night
,
and
had
a
very
reasonable
bill
to
pay
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
account
for
this
favourable
change
any
other
way
,
than
by
ascribing
it
to
the
effects
of
a
terrible
storm
,
which
had
two
days
before
torn
up
a
great
number
of
their
olive
-
trees
by
the
roots
,
and
done
such
damage
as
terrified
them
into
humility
and
submission
.
<EOS>
Next
day
,
the
water
being
delightful
,
we
arrived
by
one
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
at
Genoa
.
<EOS>
Here
I
made
another
bargain
with
our
patron
Antonio
,
to
carry
us
to
Nice
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
hitherto
remarkably
obliging
,
and
seemingly
modest
.
<EOS>
He
spoke
Latin
fluently
,
and
was
tinctured
with
the
sciences
.
<EOS>
I
began
to
imagine
he
was
a
person
of
a
good
family
,
who
had
met
with
misfortunes
in
life
,
and
respected
him
accordingly
:
but
I
afterwards
found
him
mercenary
,
mean
,
and
rapacious
.
<EOS>
The
wind
being
still
contrary
,
when
we
departed
from
Genoa
,
we
could
get
no
further
than
Finale
,
where
we
lodged
in
a
very
dismal
habitation
,
which
was
recommended
to
us
as
the
best
auberge
in
the
place
.
<EOS>
What
rendered
it
the
more
uncomfortable
,
the
night
was
cold
,
and
there
was
not
a
fire
-
place
in
the
house
,
except
in
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
The
beds
(
if
they
deserved
that
name
)
were
so
shockingly
nasty
,
that
we
could
not
have
used
them
,
had
not
a
friend
of
Mr
R
  
supplied
us
with
mattrasses
,
sheets
,
and
coverlets
;
for
our
own
sheets
were
on
board
the
felucca
,
which
was
anchored
at
a
distance
from
the
shore
.
<EOS>
Our
fare
was
equally
wretched
:
the
master
of
the
house
was
a
surly
assassin
,
and
his
cameriere
or
waiter
,
stark
-
staring
mad
.
<EOS>
Our
situation
was
at
the
same
time
shocking
and
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
Mr
R
  
quarrelled
over
night
with
the
master
,
who
swore
in
broken
French
to
my
man
,
that
he
had
a
good
mind
to
poniard
that
impertinent
Piedmontese
.
<EOS>
In
the
morning
,
before
day
,
Mr
R
 
,
coming
into
my
chamber
,
gave
me
to
understand
that
he
had
been
insulted
by
the
landlord
,
who
demanded
six
and
thirty
livres
for
our
supper
and
lodging
.
<EOS>
Incensed
at
the
rascal
's
presumption
,
I
assured
him
I
would
make
him
take
half
the
money
,
and
a
good
beating
into
the
bargain
.
<EOS>
He
replied
,
that
he
would
have
saved
me
the
trouble
of
beating
him
,
had
not
the
cameriere
,
who
was
a
very
sensible
fellow
,
assured
him
the
padrone
was
out
of
his
senses
,
and
if
roughly
handled
,
might
commit
some
extravagance
.
<EOS>
Though
I
was
exceedingly
ruffled
,
I
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
mad
cameriere
's
palming
himself
upon
R
 
y
,
as
a
sensible
fellow
,
and
transferring
the
charge
of
madness
upon
his
master
,
who
seemed
to
be
much
more
knave
than
fool
.
<EOS>
While
Mr
R
  
went
to
mass
,
I
desired
the
cameriere
to
bid
his
master
bring
the
bill
,
and
to
tell
him
that
if
it
was
not
reasonable
,
I
would
carry
him
before
the
commandant
.
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
I
armed
myself
with
my
sword
in
one
hand
and
my
cane
in
the
other
.
<EOS>
The
inn
-
keeper
immediately
entered
,
pale
and
staring
,
and
when
I
demanded
his
bill
,
he
told
me
,
with
a
profound
reverence
that
he
should
be
satisfied
with
whatever
I
myself
thought
proper
to
give
.
<EOS>
Surprised
at
this
moderation
,
I
asked
if
he
should
be
content
with
twelve
livres
,
and
he
answered
,
"
Contentissimo
,
"
with
another
prostration
.
<EOS>
Then
he
made
an
apology
for
the
bad
accommodation
of
his
house
,
and
complained
,
that
the
reproaches
of
the
other
gentleman
,
whom
he
was
pleased
to
call
my
majorduomo
,
had
almost
turned
his
brain
.
<EOS>
When
he
quitted
the
room
,
his
cameriere
,
laying
hold
of
his
master
's
last
words
,
pointed
to
his
own
forehead
,
and
said
,
he
had
informed
the
gentleman
over
night
that
his
patron
was
mad
.
<EOS>
This
day
we
were
by
a
high
wind
in
the
afternoon
,
driven
for
shelter
into
Porto
Mauritio
,
where
we
found
the
post
-
house
even
worse
than
that
of
Finale
;
and
what
rendered
it
more
shocking
was
a
girl
quite
covered
with
the
confluent
smallpox
,
who
lay
in
a
room
through
which
it
was
necessary
to
pass
to
the
other
chambers
,
and
who
smelled
so
strong
as
to
perfume
the
whole
house
.
<EOS>
We
were
but
fifteen
miles
from
St
Remo
,
where
I
knew
the
auberge
was
tolerable
,
and
thither
I
resolved
to
travel
by
land
.
<EOS>
I
accordingly
ordered
five
mules
to
travel
post
,
and
a
very
ridiculous
cavalcade
we
formed
,
the
women
being
obliged
to
use
common
saddles
;
for
in
this
country
even
the
ladies
sit
astride
.
<EOS>
The
road
lay
along
one
continued
precipice
,
and
was
so
difficult
,
that
the
beasts
never
could
exceed
a
walking
pace
.
<EOS>
In
some
places
we
were
obliged
to
alight
.
<EOS>
Seven
hours
were
spent
in
travelling
fifteen
short
miles
:
at
length
we
arrived
at
our
old
lodgings
in
St
Remo
,
which
we
found
white
-
washed
,
and
in
great
order
.
<EOS>
We
supped
pretty
comfortably
;
slept
well
;
and
had
no
reason
to
complain
of
imposition
in
paying
the
bill
.
<EOS>
This
was
not
the
case
in
the
article
of
the
mules
,
for
which
I
was
obliged
to
pay
fifty
livres
,
according
to
the
regulation
of
the
posts
.
<EOS>
The
postmaster
,
who
came
along
with
us
,
had
the
effrontery
to
tell
me
,
that
if
I
had
hired
the
mules
to
carry
me
and
my
company
to
St
Remo
,
in
the
way
of
common
travelling
,
they
would
have
cost
me
but
fifteen
livres
;
but
as
I
demanded
post
-
horses
,
I
must
submit
to
the
regulations
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
distinction
the
more
absurd
,
as
the
road
is
of
such
a
nature
as
renders
it
impossible
to
travel
faster
in
one
way
than
in
another
;
nor
indeed
is
there
the
least
difference
either
in
the
carriage
or
convenience
,
between
travelling
post
and
journey
riding
.
<EOS>
A
publican
might
with
the
same
reason
charge
me
three
livres
a
pound
for
whiting
,
and
if
questioned
about
the
imposition
,
reply
,
that
if
I
had
asked
for
fish
I
should
have
had
the
same
whiting
for
the
fifth
part
of
the
money
:
but
that
he
made
a
wide
difference
between
selling
it
as
fish
,
and
selling
it
as
whiting
.
<EOS>
Our
felucca
came
round
from
Porto
Mauritio
in
the
night
,
and
embarking
next
morning
,
we
arrived
at
Nice
about
four
in
the
afternoon
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
have
I
given
you
a
circumstantial
detail
of
my
Italian
expedition
,
during
which
I
was
exposed
to
a
great
number
of
hardships
,
which
I
thought
my
weakened
constitution
could
not
have
bore
;
as
well
as
to
violent
fits
of
passion
,
chequered
,
however
,
with
transports
of
a
more
agreeable
nature
;
<EOS>
insomuch
that
I
may
say
I
was
for
two
months
continually
agitated
either
in
mind
or
body
,
and
very
often
in
both
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
As
my
disorder
at
first
arose
from
a
sedentary
life
,
producing
a
relaxation
of
the
fibres
,
which
naturally
brought
on
a
listlessness
,
indolence
,
and
dejection
of
the
spirits
,
I
am
convinced
that
this
hard
exercise
of
mind
and
body
,
co
-
operated
with
the
change
of
air
and
objects
,
to
brace
up
the
relaxed
constitution
,
and
promote
a
more
vigorous
circulation
of
the
juices
,
which
had
long
languished
even
almost
to
stagnation
.
<EOS>
For
some
years
,
I
had
been
as
subject
to
colds
as
a
delicate
woman
new
delivered
.
<EOS>
If
I
ventured
to
go
abroad
when
there
was
the
least
moisture
either
in
the
air
,
or
upon
the
ground
,
I
was
sure
to
be
laid
up
a
fortnight
with
a
cough
and
asthma
.
<EOS>
But
,
in
this
journey
,
I
suffered
cold
and
rain
,
and
stood
,
and
walked
in
the
wet
,
heated
myself
with
exercise
,
and
sweated
violently
,
without
feeling
the
least
disorder
;
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
felt
myself
growing
stronger
every
day
in
the
midst
of
these
excesses
.
<EOS>
Since
my
return
to
Nice
,
it
has
rained
the
best
part
of
two
months
,
to
the
astonishment
of
all
the
people
in
the
country
;
yet
during
all
that
time
I
have
enjoyed
good
health
and
spirits
.
<EOS>
On
Christmas
-
Eve
,
I
went
to
the
cathedral
at
midnight
,
to
hear
high
mass
celebrated
by
the
new
bishop
of
Nice
,
in
pontificalibus
,
and
stood
near
two
hours
uncovered
in
a
cold
gallery
,
without
having
any
cause
in
the
sequel
to
repent
of
my
curiosity
.
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
I
am
now
so
well
that
I
no
longer
despair
of
seeing
you
and
the
rest
of
my
friends
in
England
;
a
pleasure
which
is
eagerly
desired
by
,
 
<EOS>
Dear
Sir
,
Your
affectionate
humble
Servant
.
   
<EOS>
NICE
,
March
23
,
1766
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
You
ask
whether
I
think
the
French
people
are
more
taxed
than
the
English
;
but
I
apprehend
,
the
question
would
be
more
apropos
if
you
asked
whether
the
French
taxes
are
more
insupportable
than
the
English
;
for
,
in
comparing
burthens
,
we
ought
always
to
consider
the
strength
of
the
shoulders
that
bear
them
.
<EOS>
I
know
no
better
way
of
estimating
the
strength
,
than
by
examining
the
face
of
the
country
,
and
observing
the
appearance
of
the
common
people
,
who
constitute
the
bulk
of
every
nation
.
<EOS>
When
I
,
therefore
,
see
the
country
of
England
smiling
with
cultivation
;
the
grounds
exhibiting
all
the
perfection
of
agriculture
,
parcelled
out
into
beautiful
inclosures
,
cornfields
,
hay
and
pasture
,
woodland
and
common
,
when
I
see
her
meadows
well
stocked
with
black
cattle
,
her
downs
covered
with
sheep
;
when
I
view
her
teams
of
horses
and
oxen
,
large
and
strong
,
fat
and
sleek
;
when
I
see
her
farm
-
houses
the
habitations
of
plenty
,
cleanliness
,
and
convenience
;
and
her
peasants
well
fed
,
well
lodged
,
well
cloathed
,
tall
and
stout
,
and
hale
and
jolly
;
I
can
not
help
concluding
that
the
people
are
well
able
to
bear
those
impositions
which
the
public
necessities
have
rendered
necessary
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
when
I
perceive
such
signs
of
poverty
,
misery
and
dirt
,
among
the
commonalty
of
France
,
their
unfenced
fields
dug
up
in
despair
,
without
the
intervention
of
meadow
or
fallow
ground
,
without
cattle
to
furnish
manure
,
without
horses
to
execute
the
plans
of
agriculture
;
their
farm
-
houses
mean
,
their
furniture
wretched
,
their
apparel
beggarly
;
themselves
and
their
beasts
the
images
of
famine
;
I
can
not
help
thinking
they
groan
under
oppression
,
either
from
their
landlords
,
or
their
government
;
probably
from
both
.
  
<EOS>
The
principal
impositions
of
the
French
government
are
these
:
<EOS>
first
,
the
taille
,
payed
by
all
the
commons
,
except
those
that
are
privileged
:
secondly
,
the
capitation
,
from
which
no
persons
(
not
even
the
nobles
)
are
excepted
:
thirdly
,
the
tenths
and
twentieths
,
called
Dixiemes
and
Vingtiemes
,
which
every
body
pays
.
<EOS>
This
tax
was
originally
levied
as
an
occasional
aid
in
times
of
war
,
and
other
emergencies
;
but
by
degrees
is
become
a
standing
revenue
even
in
time
of
peace
.
<EOS>
All
the
money
arising
from
these
impositions
goes
directly
to
the
king
's
treasury
;
and
must
undoubtedly
amount
to
a
very
great
sum
.
<EOS>
Besides
these
,
he
has
the
revenue
of
the
farms
,
consisting
of
the
droits
d'aydes
,
or
excise
on
wine
,
brandy
,
&
c.
of
the
custom
-
house
duties
;
of
the
gabelle
,
comprehending
that
most
oppressive
obligation
on
individuals
to
take
a
certain
quantity
of
salt
at
the
price
which
the
farmers
shall
please
to
fix
;
of
the
exclusive
privilege
to
sell
tobacco
;
of
the
droits
de
controlle
,
insinuation
,
centieme
denier
,
franchiefs
,
aubeine
,
echange
et
contre
-
echange
arising
from
the
acts
of
voluntary
jurisdiction
,
as
well
as
certain
law
-
suits
.
<EOS>
These
farms
are
said
to
bring
into
the
king
's
coffers
above
one
hundred
and
twenty
millions
of
livres
yearly
,
amounting
to
near
five
millions
sterling
:
but
the
poor
people
are
said
to
pay
about
a
third
more
than
this
sum
,
which
the
farmers
retain
to
enrich
themselves
,
and
bribe
the
great
for
their
protection
;
which
protection
of
the
great
is
the
true
reason
why
this
most
iniquitous
,
oppressive
,
and
absurd
method
of
levying
money
is
not
laid
aside
.
<EOS>
Over
and
above
those
articles
I
have
mentioned
,
the
French
king
draws
considerable
sums
from
his
clergy
,
under
the
denomination
of
dons
gratuits
,
or
free
-
gifts
;
as
well
as
from
the
subsidies
given
by
the
pays
d'etats
such
as
Provence
,
Languedoc
,
and
Bretagne
,
which
are
exempted
from
the
taille
.
<EOS>
The
whole
revenue
of
the
French
king
amounts
to
between
twelve
and
thirteen
millions
sterling
.
<EOS>
These
are
great
resources
for
the
king
:
but
they
will
always
keep
the
people
miserable
,
and
effectually
prevent
them
from
making
such
improvements
as
might
turn
their
lands
to
the
best
advantage
.
<EOS>
But
besides
being
eased
in
the
article
of
taxes
,
there
is
something
else
required
to
make
them
exert
themselves
for
the
benefit
of
their
country
.
<EOS>
They
must
be
free
in
their
persons
,
secure
in
their
property
,
indulged
with
reasonable
leases
,
and
effectually
protected
by
law
from
the
insolence
and
oppression
of
their
superiors
.
  
<EOS>
Great
as
the
French
king
's
resources
may
appear
,
they
are
hardly
sufficient
to
defray
the
enormous
expence
of
his
government
.
<EOS>
About
two
millions
sterling
per
annum
of
his
revenue
are
said
to
be
anticipated
for
paying
the
interest
of
the
public
debts
;
and
the
rest
is
found
inadequate
to
the
charge
of
a
prodigious
standing
army
,
a
double
frontier
of
fortified
towns
and
the
extravagant
appointments
of
ambassadors
,
generals
,
governors
,
intendants
,
commandants
,
and
other
officers
of
the
crown
,
all
of
whom
affect
a
pomp
,
which
is
equally
ridiculous
and
prodigal
.
<EOS>
A
French
general
in
the
field
is
always
attended
by
thirty
or
forty
cooks
;
and
thinks
it
is
incumbent
upon
him
,
for
the
glory
of
France
,
to
give
a
hundred
dishes
every
day
at
his
table
.
<EOS>
When
don
Philip
,
and
the
marechal
duke
de
Belleisle
,
had
their
quarters
at
Nice
,
there
were
fifty
scullions
constantly
employed
in
the
great
square
in
plucking
poultry
.
<EOS>
This
absurd
luxury
infects
their
whole
army
.
<EOS>
Even
the
commissaries
keep
open
table
;
and
nothing
is
seen
but
prodigality
and
profusion
.
<EOS>
The
king
of
Sardinia
proceeds
upon
another
plan
.
<EOS>
His
troops
are
better
cloathed
,
better
payed
,
and
better
fed
than
those
of
France
.
<EOS>
The
commandant
of
Nice
has
about
four
hundred
a
year
of
appointments
,
which
enable
him
to
live
decently
,
and
even
to
entertain
strangers
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
the
commandant
of
Antibes
,
which
is
in
all
respects
more
inconsiderable
than
Nice
,
has
from
the
French
king
above
five
times
the
sum
to
support
the
glory
of
his
monarch
,
which
all
the
sensible
part
of
mankind
treat
with
ridicule
and
contempt
.
<EOS>
But
the
finances
of
France
are
so
ill
managed
,
that
many
of
their
commandants
,
and
other
officers
,
have
not
been
able
to
draw
their
appointments
these
two
years
.
<EOS>
In
vain
they
complain
and
remonstrate
.
<EOS>
When
they
grow
troublesome
they
are
removed
.
<EOS>
How
then
must
they
support
the
glory
of
France
?
<EOS>
How
,
but
by
oppressing
the
poor
people
.
<EOS>
The
treasurer
makes
use
of
their
money
for
his
own
benefit
.
<EOS>
The
king
knows
it
;
he
knows
his
officers
,
thus
defrauded
,
fleece
and
oppress
his
people
:
but
he
thinks
proper
to
wink
at
these
abuses
.
<EOS>
That
government
may
be
said
to
be
weak
and
tottering
which
finds
itself
obliged
to
connive
at
such
proceedings
.
<EOS>
The
king
of
France
,
in
order
to
give
strength
and
stability
to
his
administration
,
ought
to
have
sense
to
adopt
a
sage
plan
of
oeconomy
,
and
vigour
of
mind
sufficient
to
execute
it
in
all
its
parts
,
with
the
most
rigorous
exactness
.
<EOS>
He
ought
to
have
courage
enough
to
find
fault
,
and
even
to
punish
the
delinquents
,
of
what
quality
soever
they
may
be
:
and
the
first
act
of
reformation
ought
to
be
a
total
abolition
of
all
the
farms
.
<EOS>
There
are
,
undoubtedly
,
many
marks
of
relaxation
in
the
reins
of
the
French
government
,
and
,
in
all
probability
,
the
subjects
of
France
will
be
the
first
to
take
advantage
of
it
.
<EOS>
There
is
at
present
a
violent
fermentation
of
different
principles
among
them
,
which
under
the
reign
of
a
very
weak
prince
,
or
during
a
long
minority
,
may
produce
a
great
change
in
the
constitution
.
<EOS>
In
proportion
to
the
progress
of
reason
and
philosophy
,
which
have
made
great
advances
in
this
kingdom
,
superstition
loses
ground
;
antient
prejudices
give
way
;
a
spirit
of
freedom
takes
the
ascendant
.
<EOS>
All
the
learned
laity
of
France
detest
the
hierarchy
as
a
plan
of
despotism
,
founded
on
imposture
and
usurpation
.
<EOS>
The
protestants
,
who
are
very
numerous
in
southern
parts
,
abhor
it
with
all
the
rancour
of
religious
fanaticism
.
<EOS>
Many
of
the
commons
,
enriched
by
commerce
and
manufacture
,
grow
impatient
of
those
odious
distinctions
,
which
exclude
them
from
the
honours
and
privileges
due
to
their
importance
in
the
commonwealth
;
and
all
the
parliaments
,
or
tribunals
of
justice
in
the
kingdom
,
seem
bent
upon
asserting
their
rights
and
independence
in
the
face
of
the
king
's
prerogative
,
and
even
at
the
expence
of
his
power
and
authority
.
<EOS>
Should
any
prince
therefore
be
seduced
by
evil
counsellors
,
or
misled
by
his
own
bigotry
,
to
take
some
arbitrary
step
,
that
may
be
extremely
disagreeable
to
all
those
communities
,
without
having
spirit
to
exert
the
violence
of
his
power
for
the
support
of
his
measures
,
he
will
become
equally
detested
and
despised
;
and
the
influence
of
the
commons
will
insensibly
encroach
upon
the
pretensions
of
the
crown
.
<EOS>
But
if
in
the
time
of
a
minority
,
the
power
of
the
government
should
be
divided
among
different
competitors
for
the
regency
,
the
parliaments
and
people
will
find
it
still
more
easy
to
acquire
and
ascertain
the
liberty
at
which
they
aspire
,
because
they
will
have
the
balance
of
power
in
their
hands
,
and
be
able
to
make
either
scale
preponderate
.
<EOS>
I
could
say
a
great
deal
more
upon
this
subject
;
and
I
have
some
remarks
to
make
relating
to
the
methods
which
might
be
taken
in
the
case
of
a
fresh
rupture
with
France
,
for
making
a
vigorous
impression
on
that
kingdom
.
<EOS>
But
these
I
in
list
defer
till
another
occasion
,
having
neither
room
nor
leisure
at
present
to
add
any
thing
,
but
that
I
am
,
with
great
truth
,
 
Dear
Sir
,
Your
very
humble
Servant

NICE
,
April

.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
DOCTOR
,
 
As
I
have
now
passed
a
second
winter
at
Nice
<EOS>
I
think
myself
qualified
to
make
some
further
remarks
on
this
climate
.
<EOS>
During
the
heats
of
last
summer
,
I
flattered
myself
with
the
prospect
of
the
fine
weather
I
should
enjoy
in
the
winter
;
but
neither
I
,
nor
any
person
in
this
country
,
could
foresee
the
rainy
weather
that
prevailed
from
the
middle
of
November
,
till
the
twentieth
of
March
.
<EOS>
In
this
short
period
of
four
months
,
we
have
had
fifty
-
six
days
of
rain
,
which
I
take
to
be
a
greater
quantity
than
generally
falls
during
the
six
worst
months
of
the
year
in
the
county
of
Middlesex
,
especially
as
it
was
,
for
the
most
part
,
a
heavy
,
continued
rain
.
<EOS>
The
south
winds
generally
predominate
in
the
wet
season
at
Nice
:
but
this
winter
the
rain
was
accompanied
with
every
wind
that
blows
,
except
the
south
;
though
the
most
frequent
were
those
that
came
from
the
east
and
north
quarters
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
these
great
rains
,
such
as
were
never
known
before
at
Nice
in
the
memory
of
man
,
the
intermediate
days
of
fair
weather
were
delightful
,
and
the
ground
seemed
perfectly
dry
.
<EOS>
The
air
itself
was
perfectly
free
from
moisture
.
<EOS>
Though
I
live
upon
a
ground
floor
,
surrounded
on
three
sides
by
a
garden
,
I
could
not
perceive
the
least
damp
,
either
on
the
floors
,
or
the
furniture
;
neither
was
I
much
incommoded
by
the
asthma
,
which
used
always
to
harass
me
most
in
wet
weather
.
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
I
passed
the
winter
here
much
more
comfortably
than
I
expected
.
<EOS>
About
the
vernal
equinox
,
however
,
I
caught
a
violent
cold
,
which
was
attended
with
a
difficulty
of
breathing
,
and
as
the
sun
advances
towards
the
tropic
,
I
find
myself
still
more
subject
to
rheums
.
<EOS>
As
the
heat
increases
,
the
humours
of
the
body
are
rarefied
,
and
,
of
consequence
,
the
pores
of
the
skin
are
opened
;
while
the
east
wind
sweeping
over
the
Alps
and
Apennines
,
covered
with
snow
,
continues
surprisingly
sharp
and
penetrating
.
<EOS>
Even
the
people
of
the
country
,
who
enjoy
good
health
,
are
afraid
of
exposing
themselves
to
the
air
at
this
season
,
the
intemperature
of
which
may
last
till
the
middle
of
May
,
when
all
the
snow
on
the
mountains
will
probably
be
melted
:
then
the
air
will
become
mild
and
balmy
,
till
,
in
the
progress
of
summer
,
it
grows
disagreeably
hot
,
and
the
strong
evaporation
from
the
sea
makes
it
so
saline
,
as
to
be
unhealthy
for
those
who
have
a
scorbutical
habit
.
<EOS>
When
the
sea
-
breeze
is
high
,
this
evaporation
is
so
great
as
to
cover
the
surface
of
the
body
with
a
kind
of
volatile
brine
,
as
I
plainly
perceived
last
summer
.
<EOS>
I
am
more
and
more
convinced
that
this
climate
is
unfavourable
for
the
scurvy
.
<EOS>
Were
I
obliged
to
pass
my
life
in
it
,
I
would
endeavour
to
find
a
country
retreat
among
the
mountains
,
at
some
distance
from
the
sea
,
where
I
might
enjoy
a
cool
air
,
free
from
this
impregnation
,
unmolested
by
those
flies
,
gnats
,
and
other
vermin
which
render
the
lower
parts
almost
uninhabitable
.
<EOS>
To
this
place
I
would
retire
in
the
month
of
June
,
and
there
continue
till
the
beginning
of
October
,
when
I
would
return
to
my
habitation
in
Nice
,
where
the
winter
is
remarkably
mild
and
agreeable
.
<EOS>
In
March
and
April
however
,
I
would
not
advise
a
valetudinarian
to
go
forth
,
without
taking
precaution
against
the
cold
.
<EOS>
An
agreeable
summer
retreat
may
be
found
on
the
other
side
of
the
Var
,
at
,
or
near
the
town
of
Grasse
,
which
is
pleasantly
situated
on
the
ascent
of
a
hill
in
Provence
,
about
seven
English
miles
from
Nice
.
<EOS>
This
place
is
famous
for
its
pomatum
,
gloves
,
wash
-
balls
,
perfumes
,
and
toilette
-
boxes
,
lined
with
bergamot
.
<EOS>
I
am
told
it
affords
good
lodging
,
and
is
well
supplied
with
provisions
.
  
<EOS>
We
are
now
preparing
for
our
journey
to
England
,
from
the
exercise
of
which
I
promise
myself
much
benefit
:
a
journey
extremely
agreeable
,
not
only
on
that
account
,
but
also
because
it
will
restore
me
to
the
company
of
my
friends
,
and
remove
me
from
a
place
where
I
leave
nothing
but
the
air
which
I
can
possibly
regret
.
  
<EOS>
The
only
friendships
I
have
contracted
at
Nice
are
with
strangers
,
who
,
like
myself
,
only
sojourn
here
for
a
season
.
<EOS>
I
now
find
by
experience
,
it
is
great
folly
to
buy
furniture
,
unless
one
is
resolved
to
settle
here
for
some
years
.
<EOS>
The
Nissards
assured
me
,
with
great
confidence
,
that
I
should
always
be
able
to
sell
it
for
a
very
little
loss
;
whereas
I
find
myself
obliged
to
part
with
it
for
about
one
-
third
of
what
it
cost
.
<EOS>
I
have
sent
for
a
coach
to
Aix
,
and
as
soon
as
it
arrives
,
shall
take
my
departure
;
so
that
the
next
letter
you
receive
from
me
will
be
dated
at
some
place
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
I
purpose
to
take
Antibes
,
Toulon
,
Marseilles
,
Aix
,
Avignon
,
and
Orange
,
in
my
way
:
places
which
I
have
not
yet
seen
;
and
where
,
perhaps
,
I
shall
find
something
for
your
amusement
,
which
will
always
be
a
consideration
of
some
weight
with
,
 
Dear
Sir
,
Yours
.

<EOS>
TURIN
,
March
18
,
1765
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
Turin
is
about
thirty
leagues
from
Nice
,
the
greater
part
of
the
way
lying
over
frightful
mountains
covered
with
snow
.
<EOS>
The
difficulty
of
the
road
,
however
,
reaches
no
farther
than
Coni
,
from
whence
there
is
an
open
highway
through
a
fine
plain
country
,
as
far
as
the
capital
of
Piedmont
,
and
the
traveller
is
accommodated
with
chaise
and
horses
to
proceed
either
post
,
or
by
cambiatura
,
as
in
other
parts
of
Italy
.
<EOS>
There
are
only
two
ways
of
performing
the
journey
over
the
mountains
from
Nice
;
one
is
to
ride
a
mule
-
back
,
and
the
other
to
be
carried
in
a
chair
.
<EOS>
The
former
I
chose
,
and
set
out
with
my
servant
on
the
seventh
day
of
February
at
two
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
I
was
hardly
clear
of
Nice
,
when
it
began
to
rain
so
hard
that
in
less
than
an
hour
the
mud
was
half
a
foot
deep
in
many
parts
of
the
road
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
only
inconvenience
we
suffered
,
the
way
being
in
other
respects
practicable
enough
;
for
there
is
but
one
small
hill
to
cross
on
this
side
of
the
village
of
L'Escarene
,
where
we
arrived
about
six
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
The
ground
in
this
neighbourhood
is
tolerably
cultivated
,
and
the
mountains
are
planted
to
the
tops
with
olive
trees
.
<EOS>
The
accommodation
here
is
so
very
bad
,
that
I
had
no
inclination
to
be
a
-
bed
longer
than
was
absolutely
necessary
for
refreshment
;
and
therefore
I
proceeded
on
my
journey
at
two
in
the
morning
,
conducted
by
a
guide
,
whom
I
hired
for
this
purpose
at
the
rate
of
three
livres
a
day
.
<EOS>
Having
ascended
one
side
,
and
descended
the
other
,
of
the
mountain
called
Braus
,
which
took
up
four
hours
,
though
the
road
is
not
bad
,
we
at
six
reached
the
village
of
Sospello
,
which
is
agreeably
situated
in
a
small
valley
,
surrounded
by
prodigious
high
and
barren
mountains
.
<EOS>
This
little
plain
is
pretty
fertile
,
and
being
watered
by
a
pleasant
stream
,
forms
a
delightful
contrast
with
the
hideous
rocks
that
surround
it
.
<EOS>
Having
reposed
myself
and
my
mules
two
hours
at
this
place
,
we
continued
our
journey
over
the
second
mountain
,
called
Brovis
,
which
is
rather
more
considerable
than
the
first
,
and
in
four
hours
arrived
at
La
Giandola
,
a
tolerable
inn
situated
betwixt
<EOS>
the
high
road
and
a
small
river
,
about
a
gunshot
from
the
town
of
Brieglie
,
which
we
leave
on
the
right
.
<EOS>
As
we
jogged
along
in
the
grey
of
the
morning
,
I
was
a
little
startled
at
two
figures
which
I
saw
before
me
,
and
began
to
put
my
pistols
in
order
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
observed
that
these
mountains
are
infested
with
contrabandiers
,
a
set
of
smuggling
peasants
,
very
bold
and
desperate
,
who
make
a
traffic
of
selling
tobacco
,
salt
,
and
other
merchandize
,
which
have
not
payed
duty
,
and
sometimes
lay
travellers
under
contribution
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
doubt
but
there
was
a
gang
of
these
free
-
booters
at
hand
;
but
as
no
more
than
two
persons
appeared
,
I
resolved
to
let
them
know
we
were
prepared
for
defence
,
and
fired
one
of
my
pistols
,
in
hope
that
the
report
of
it
,
echoed
from
the
surrounding
rocks
,
would
produce
a
proper
effect
:
<EOS>
but
,
the
mountains
and
roads
being
entirely
covered
with
snow
to
a
considerable
depth
,
there
was
little
or
no
reverberation
,
and
the
sound
was
not
louder
than
that
of
a
pop
-
gun
,
although
the
piece
contained
a
good
charge
of
powder
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
it
did
not
fail
to
engage
the
attention
of
the
strangers
,
one
of
whom
immediately
wheeled
to
the
left
about
,
and
being
by
this
time
very
near
me
,
gave
me
an
opportunity
of
contemplating
his
whole
person
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
tall
,
meagre
,
and
yellow
,
with
a
long
hooked
nose
,
and
small
twinkling
eyes
.
<EOS>
His
head
was
eased
in
a
woollen
night
-
cap
,
over
which
he
wore
a
flapped
hat
;
he
had
a
silk
handkerchief
about
his
neck
,
and
his
mouth
was
furnished
with
a
short
wooden
pipe
,
from
which
he
discharged
wreathing
clouds
of
tobacco
-
smoke
.
<EOS>
He
was
wrapped
in
a
kind
of
capot
of
green
bays
,
lined
with
wolf
-
skin
,
had
a
pair
of
monstrous
boots
,
quilted
on
the
inside
with
cotton
,
was
almost
covered
with
dirt
,
and
rode
a
mule
so
low
that
his
long
legs
hung
dangling
within
six
inches
of
the
ground
.
<EOS>
This
grotesque
figure
was
so
much
more
ludicrous
than
terrible
,
that
I
could
not
help
laughing
;
when
,
taking
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
,
he
very
politely
accosted
me
by
name
.
<EOS>
You
may
easily
guess
I
was
exceedingly
surprised
at
such
an
address
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
Brovis
:
but
he
forthwith
put
an
end
to
it
too
,
by
discovering
himself
to
be
the
marquis
<EOS>
M
 
,
whom
I
had
the
honour
to
be
acquainted
with
at
Nice
.
<EOS>
After
having
rallied
him
upon
his
equipage
,
he
gave
me
to
understand
he
had
set
out
from
Nice
the
morning
of
the
same
day
that
I
departed
;
that
he
was
going
to
Turin
,
and
that
he
had
sent
one
of
his
servants
before
him
to
Coni
with
his
baggage
.
<EOS>
Knowing
him
to
be
an
agreeable
companion
,
I
was
glad
of
this
encounter
,
and
we
resolved
to
travel
the
rest
of
the
way
together
.
<EOS>
We
dined
at
La
Giandola
,
and
in
the
afternoon
rode
along
the
little
river
Roida
,
which
runs
in
a
bottom
between
frightful
precipices
,
and
in
several
places
forms
natural
cascades
,
the
noise
of
which
had
well
-
nigh
deprived
us
of
the
sense
of
hearing
;
after
a
winding
course
among
these
mountains
,
it
discharges
itself
into
the
Mediterranean
at
Vintimiglia
,
in
the
territory
of
Genoa
.
<EOS>
As
the
snow
did
not
lie
on
these
mountains
,
when
we
cracked
our
whips
,
there
was
such
a
repercussion
of
the
sound
as
is
altogether
inconceivable
.
<EOS>
We
passed
by
the
village
of
Saorgio
,
situated
on
an
eminence
,
where
there
is
a
small
fortress
which
commands
the
whole
pass
,
and
in
five
hours
arrived
at
our
inn
,
on
this
side
the
Col
de
Tende
,
where
we
took
up
our
quarters
,
but
had
very
little
reason
to
boast
of
our
entertainment
.
<EOS>
Our
greatest
difficulty
,
however
,
consisted
in
pulling
off
the
marquis
's
boots
,
which
were
of
the
kind
called
Seafarot
,
by
this
time
so
loaded
with
dirt
on
the
outside
,
and
so
swelled
with
the
rain
within
,
that
he
could
neither
drag
them
after
him
as
he
walked
,
nor
disencumber
his
legs
of
them
,
without
such
violence
as
seemed
almost
sufficient
to
tear
him
limb
from
limb
.
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
we
were
obliged
to
tie
a
rope
about
his
heel
,
and
all
the
people
in
the
house
assisting
to
pull
,
the
poor
marquis
was
drawn
from
one
end
of
the
apartment
to
the
other
before
the
boot
would
give
way
:
at
last
his
legs
were
happily
disengaged
,
and
the
machines
carefully
dried
and
stuffed
for
next
day
's
journey
.
  
<EOS>
We
took
our
departure
from
hence
at
three
in
the
morning
,
and
at
four
,
began
to
mount
the
Col
de
Tende
,
which
is
by
far
the
highest
mountain
in
the
whole
journey
:
it
was
now
quite
covered
with
snow
,
which
at
the
top
of
it
was
near
twenty
feet
thick
.
<EOS>
Half
way
up
,
there
are
quarters
for
a
detachment
of
soldiers
,
posted
here
to
prevent
smuggling
,
and
an
inn
called
La
Ca
,
which
in
the
language
of
the
country
signifies
the
house
.
<EOS>
At
this
place
,
we
hired
six
men
to
assist
us
in
ascending
the
mountain
,
each
of
them
provided
with
a
kind
of
hough
to
break
the
ice
,
and
make
a
sort
of
steps
for
the
mules
.
<EOS>
When
we
were
near
the
top
,
however
,
we
were
obliged
to
alight
,
and
climb
the
mountain
supported
each
by
two
of
those
men
,
called
Coulants
who
walk
upon
the
snow
with
great
firmness
and
security
.
<EOS>
We
were
followed
by
the
mules
,
and
though
they
are
very
sure
-
footed
animals
,
and
were
frost
-
shod
for
the
occasion
,
they
stumbled
and
fell
very
often
;
the
ice
being
so
hard
that
the
sharp
-
headed
nails
in
their
shoes
could
not
penetrate
.
<EOS>
Having
reached
the
top
of
this
mountain
,
from
whence
there
is
no
prospect
but
of
other
rocks
and
mountains
,
we
prepared
for
descending
on
the
other
side
by
the
Leze
,
which
is
an
occasional
sledge
made
of
two
pieces
of
wood
,
carried
up
by
the
Coulants
for
this
purpose
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
much
relish
this
kind
of
carriage
,
especially
as
the
mountain
was
very
steep
,
and
covered
with
such
a
thick
fog
that
we
could
hardly
see
two
or
three
yards
before
us
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
our
guides
were
so
confident
,
and
my
companion
,
who
had
passed
the
same
way
on
other
occasions
,
was
so
secure
,
that
I
ventured
to
place
myself
on
this
machine
,
one
of
the
coulants
standing
behind
me
,
and
the
other
sitting
before
,
as
the
conductor
,
with
his
feet
paddling
among
the
snow
,
in
order
to
moderate
the
velocity
of
its
descent
.
<EOS>
Thus
accommodated
,
we
descended
the
mountain
with
such
rapidity
,
that
in
an
hour
we
reached
Limon
,
which
is
the
native
place
of
almost
all
the
muleteers
who
transport
merchandize
from
Nice
to
Coni
and
Turin
.
<EOS>
Here
we
waited
full
two
hours
for
the
mules
,
which
travelled
with
the
servants
by
the
common
road
.
<EOS>
To
each
of
the
coulants
we
paid
forty
sols
,
which
are
nearly
equal
to
two
shillings
sterling
.
<EOS>
Leaving
Limon
,
we
were
in
two
hours
quite
disengaged
from
the
gorges
of
the
mountains
,
which
are
partly
covered
with
wood
and
pasturage
,
though
altogether
inaccessible
,
except
in
summer
;
but
from
the
foot
of
the
Col
de
Tende
,
the
road
lies
through
a
plain
all
the
way
to
Turin
.
<EOS>
We
took
six
hours
to
travel
from
the
inn
where
we
had
lodged
over
the
mountain
to
Limon
,
and
five
hours
from
thence
to
Coni
.
<EOS>
Here
we
found
our
baggage
,
which
we
had
sent
off
by
the
carriers
one
day
before
we
departed
from
Nice
;
and
here
we
dismissed
our
guides
,
together
with
the
mules
.
<EOS>
In
winter
,
you
have
a
mule
for
this
whole
journey
at
the
rate
of
twenty
livres
;
and
the
guides
are
payed
at
the
rate
of
two
livres
a
day
,
reckoning
six
days
,
three
for
the
journey
to
Coni
,
and
three
for
their
return
to
Nice
.
<EOS>
We
set
out
so
early
in
the
morning
in
order
to
avoid
the
inconveniencies
and
dangers
that
attend
the
passage
of
this
mountain
.
<EOS>
The
first
of
these
arises
from
your
meeting
with
long
strings
of
loaded
mules
in
a
slippery
road
,
the
breadth
of
which
does
not
exceed
a
foot
and
an
half
.
<EOS>
As
it
is
altogether
impossible
for
two
mules
to
pass
each
other
in
such
a
narrow
path
,
the
muleteers
have
made
doublings
or
elbows
in
different
parts
,
and
when
the
troops
of
mules
meet
,
the
least
numerous
is
obliged
to
turn
off
into
one
of
these
doublings
,
and
there
halt
until
the
others
are
past
.
<EOS>
Travellers
,
in
order
to
avoid
this
disagreeable
delay
,
which
is
the
more
vexatious
,
considering
the
excessive
cold
,
begin
the
ascent
of
the
mountain
early
in
the
morning
before
the
mules
quit
their
inns
.
<EOS>
But
the
great
danger
of
travelling
here
when
the
sun
is
up
,
proceeds
from
what
they
call
the
Valanches
.
<EOS>
These
are
balls
of
snow
detached
from
the
mountains
which
over
-
top
the
road
,
either
by
the
heat
of
the
sun
,
or
the
humidity
of
the
weather
.
<EOS>
A
piece
of
snow
thus
loosened
from
the
rock
,
though
perhaps
not
above
three
or
four
feet
in
diameter
,
increases
sometimes
in
its
descent
to
such
a
degree
,
as
to
become
two
hundred
paces
in
length
,
and
rolls
down
with
such
rapidity
,
that
the
traveller
is
crushed
to
death
before
he
can
make
three
steps
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
These
dreadful
heaps
drag
every
thing
along
with
them
in
their
descent
.
<EOS>
They
tear
up
huge
trees
by
the
roots
,
and
if
they
chance
to
fall
upon
a
house
,
demolish
it
to
the
foundation
.
<EOS>
Accidents
of
this
nature
seldom
happen
in
the
winter
while
the
weather
is
dry
;
and
yet
scarce
a
year
passes
in
which
some
mules
and
their
drivers
do
not
perish
by
the
valanches
.
<EOS>
At
Coni
we
found
the
countess
C
  
from
Nice
,
who
had
made
the
same
journey
in
a
chair
,
carried
by
porters
.
<EOS>
This
is
no
other
than
a
common
elbow
-
chair
of
wood
,
with
a
	
straw
bottom
,
covered
above
with
waxed
cloth
,
to
protect
the
traveller
from
the
rain
or
snow
,
and
provided
with
a
foot
-
board
upon
which
the
feet
rest
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
carried
like
a
sedan
-
chair
;
and
for
this
purpose
six
or
eight
porters
are
employed
at
the
rate
of
three
or
four
livres
a
head
per
day
,
according
to
the
season
,
allowing
three
days
for
their
return
.
<EOS>
Of
these
six
men
,
two
are
between
the
poles
carrying
like
common
chairmen
,
and
each
of
these
is
supported
by
the
other
two
,
one
at
each
hand
:
<EOS>
but
as
those
in
the
middle
sustain
the
greatest
burthen
,
they
are
relieved
by
the
others
in
a
regular
rotation
.
<EOS>
In
descending
the
mountain
,
they
carry
the
poles
on
their
shoulders
,
and
in
that
case
,
four
men
are
employed
,
one
at
each
end
.
  
<EOS>
At
Coni
,
you
may
have
a
chaise
to
go
with
the
same
horses
to
Turin
,
for
which
you
pay
fifteen
livres
,
and
are
a
day
and
a
half
on
the
way
.
<EOS>
You
may
post
it
,
however
,
in
one
day
,
and
then
the
price
is
seven
livres
ten
sols
per
post
,
and
ten
sols
to
the
postilion
.
<EOS>
The
method
we
took
was
that
of
cambiatura
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
chaise
with
horses
shifted
at
the
same
stages
that
are
used
in
posting
:
but
as
it
is
supposed
to
move
slower
,
we
pay
but
five
livres
per
post
,
and
ten
sols
to
the
postilion
.
<EOS>
In
order
to
quicken
its
pace
,
we
gave
ten
sols
extraordinary
to
each
postilion
,
and
for
this
gratification
,
he
drove
us
even
faster
than
the
post
.
<EOS>
The
chaises
are
like
those
of
Italy
,
and
will
take
on
near
two
hundred
weight
of
baggage
.
  
<EOS>
Coni
is
situated
between
two
small
streams
,
and
though
neither
very
large
nor
populous
,
is
considerable
for
the
strength
of
its
fortifications
.
<EOS>
It
is
honoured
with
the
title
of
the
Maiden
-
Fortress
,
because
though
several
times
besieged
,
it
was
never
taken
.
<EOS>
The
prince
of
Conti
invested
it
in
the
war
of
1744
;
but
he
was
obliged
to
raise
the
siege
,
after
having
given
battle
to
the
king
of
Sardinia
.
<EOS>
The
place
was
gallantly
defended
by
the
baron
Leutrum
,
a
German
protestant
,
the
best
general
in
the
Sardinian
service
:
but
what
contributed
most
to
the
miscarriage
of
the
enemy
,
was
a
long
tract
of
heavy
rains
,
which
destroyed
all
their
works
,
and
rendered
their
advances
impracticable
.
  
<EOS>
I
need
not
tell
you
that
Piedmont
is
one
of
the
most
fertile
and
agreeable
countries
in
Europe
,
and
this
the
most
agreeable
part
of
all
Piedmont
,
though
it
now
appeared
to
disadvantage
from
the
rigorous
season
of
the
year
:
I
shall
only
observe
that
we
passed
through
Sabellian
,
which
is
a
considerable
town
,
and
arrived
in
the
evening
at
Turin
.
<EOS>
We
entered
this
fine
city
by
the
gate
of
Nice
,
and
passing
through
the
elegant
Piazza
di
San
Carlo
,
took
up
our
quarters
at
the
Bona
Fama
,
which
stands
at
one
corner
of
the
great
square
,
called
La
Piazza
Castel
.
  
<EOS>
Were
I
even
disposed
to
give
a
description
of
Turin
,
I
should
be
obliged
to
postpone
it
till
another
opportunity
,
having
no
room
at
present
to
say
any
thing
more
,
but
that
I
am
always
 
Yours

<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
I
am
thus
far
on
my
way
to
England
.
<EOS>
I
had
resolved
to
leave
Nice
,
without
having
the
least
dispute
with
any
one
native
of
the
place
;
but
I
found
it
impossible
to
keep
this
resolution
.
<EOS>
My
landlord
,
Mr
C
 
,
a
man
of
fashion
,
with
whose
family
we
had
always
lived
in
friendship
,
was
so
reasonable
as
to
expect
I
should
give
him
up
the
house
and
garden
,
though
they
were
to
be
paid
for
till
Michaelmas
,
and
peremptorily
declared
I
should
not
be
permitted
to
sub
-
let
them
to
any
other
person
.
<EOS>
He
had
of
his
own
accord
assured
me
more
than
once
that
he
would
take
my
furniture
off
my
hands
,
and
trusting
to
this
assurance
<EOS>
,
I
had
lost
the
opportunity
,
of
disposing
it
to
advantage
:
<EOS>
but
,
when
the
time
of
my
departure
drew
near
,
he
refused
to
take
it
,
at
the
same
time
insisting
upon
having
the
key
of
the
house
and
garden
,
as
well
as
on
being
paid
the
whole
rent
directly
,
though
it
would
not
be
due
till
the
middle
of
September
.
<EOS>
I
was
so
exasperated
at
this
treatment
from
a
man
whom
I
had
cultivated
with
particular
respect
,
that
I
determined
to
contest
it
at
law
:
<EOS>
but
the
affair
was
accommodated
by
the
mediation
of
a
father
of
the
Minims
,
a
friend
to
both
,
and
a
merchant
of
Nice
,
who
charged
himself
with
the
care
of
the
house
and
furniture
.
<EOS>
A
stranger
must
conduct
himself
with
the
utmost
circumspection
to
be
able
to
live
among
these
people
without
being
the
dupe
of
imposition
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
sent
to
Aix
for
a
coach
and
four
horses
,
which
I
hired
at
the
rate
of
eighteen
French
livres
a
day
,
being
equal
to
fifteen
shillings
and
nine
-
pence
sterling
.
<EOS>
The
river
Var
was
so
swelled
by
the
melting
of
the
snow
on
the
mountains
,
as
to
be
impassable
by
any
wheel
-
carriage
;
and
,
therefore
,
the
coach
remained
at
Antibes
,
to
which
we
went
by
water
,
the
distance
being
about
nine
or
ten
miles
.
<EOS>
This
is
the
Antipolis
of
the
antients
,
said
to
have
been
built
like
Nice
,
by
a
colony
from
Marseilles
.
<EOS>
In
all
probability
,
however
,
it
was
later
than
the
foundation
of
Nice
,
and
took
its
name
from
its
being
situated
directly
opposite
to
that
city
.
<EOS>
Pliny
says
it
was
famous
for
its
tunny
-
fishery
;
and
to
this
circumstance
Martial
alludes
in
the
following
lines
  
Antipolitani
,
fateor
,
sum

.
<EOS>

<EOS>
Right
Scomber
had
I
been
,
I
ne'er
had
come
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
The
famous
pickle
Garum
was
made
from
the
Thynnus
or
Tunny
as
well
as
from
the
Scomber
,
but
that
from
the
Scomber
was
counted
the
most
delicate
.
<EOS>
Commentators
,
however
,
are
not
agreed
about
the
Scomber
or
Scombrus
.
<EOS>
Some
suppose
it
was
the
Herring
or
Sprat
;
others
believe
it
was
the
mackarel
;
after
all
,
perhaps
it
was
the
Anchovy
,
which
I
do
not
find
distinguished
by
any
other
Latin
name
:
for
the
Encrasicolus
is
a
Greek
appellation
altogether
generical
.
<EOS>
Those
who
would
be
further
informed
about
the
Garum
and
the
Scomber
may
consult

<EOS>
At
present
,
Antibes
is
the
frontier
of
France
towards
Italy
,
pretty
strongly
fortified
,
and
garrisoned
by
a
battalion
of
soldiers
.
<EOS>
The
town
is
small
and
inconsiderable
:
but
the
basin
of
the
harbour
is
surrounded
to
seaward
by
a
curious
bulwark
founded
upon
piles
driven
in
the
water
,
consisting
of
a
wall
,
ramparts
,
casemates
,
and
quay
.
<EOS>
Vessels
lie
very
safe
in
this
harbour
;
but
there
is
not
water
at
the
entrance
of
it
to
admit
of
ships
of
any
burthen
.
<EOS>
The
shallows
run
so
far
off
from
the
coast
,
that
a
ship
of
force
can
not
lie
near
enough
to
batter
the
town
;
but
it
was
bombarded
in
the
late
war
.
<EOS>
Its
chief
strength
by
land
consists
in
a
small
quadrangular
fort
detached
from
the
body
of
the
place
,
which
,
in
a
particular
manner
,
commands
the
entrance
of
the
harbour
.
<EOS>
The
wall
of
the
town
built
in
the
sea
has
embrasures
and
salient
angles
,
on
which
a
great
number
of
cannon
may
be
mounted
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
the
adjacent
country
is
much
more
pleasant
than
that
on
the
side
of
Nice
;
and
there
is
certainly
no
essential
difference
in
the
climate
.
<EOS>
The
ground
here
is
not
so
encumbered
;
it
is
laid
out
in
agreeable
inclosures
,
with
intervals
of
open
fields
,
and
the
mountains
rise
with
an
easy
ascent
at
a
much
greater
distance
from
the
sea
,
than
on
the
other
side
of
the
bay
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
here
are
charming
rides
along
the
beach
,
which
is
smooth
and
firm
.
<EOS>
When
we
passed
in
the
last
week
of
April
,
the
corn
was
in
the
ear
;
the
cherries
were
almost
ripe
;
and
the
figs
had
begun
to
blacken
.
<EOS>
I
had
embarked
my
heavy
baggage
on
board
a
London
ship
,
which
happened
to
be
at
Nice
,
ready
to
sail
:
as
for
our
small
trunks
or
portmanteaus
,
which
we
carried
along
with
us
,
they
were
examined
at
Antibes
;
but
the
ceremony
was
performed
very
superficially
,
in
consequence
of
tipping
the
searcher
with
half
-
a
-
crown
,
which
is
a
wonderful
conciliator
at
all
the
bureaus
in
this
country
.
  
<EOS>
We
lay
at
Cannes
,
a
neat
village
,
charmingly
situated
on
the
beach
of
the
Mediterranean
,
exactly
opposite
to
the
isles
Marguerites
,
where
state
-
prisoners
are
confined
.
<EOS>
As
there
are
some
good
houses
in
this
place
,
I
would
rather
live
here
for
the
sake
of
the
mild
climate
,
than
either
at
Antibes
or
Nice
.
<EOS>
Here
you
are
not
cooped
up
within
walls
,
nor
crowded
with
soldiers
and
people
:
but
are
already
in
the
country
,
enjoy
a
fine
air
,
and
are
well
supplied
with
all
sorts
of
fish
.
  
<EOS>
The
mountains
of
Esterelles
,
which
in
one
of
my
former
letters
I
described
as
a
most
romantic
and
noble
plantation
of
ever
-
greens
,
trees
,
shrubs
,
and
aromatic
plants
,
is
at
present
quite
desolate
.
<EOS>
Last
summer
,
some
execrable
villains
set
fire
to
the
pines
,
when
the
wind
was
high
.
<EOS>
It
continued
burning
for
several
months
,
and
the
conflagration
extended
above
ten
leagues
,
consuming
an
incredible
quantity
of
timber
.
<EOS>
The
ground
is
now
naked
on
each
side
of
the
road
,
or
occupied
by
the
black
trunks
of
the
trees
,
which
have
been
scorched
without
falling
.
<EOS>
They
stand
as
so
many
monuments
of
the
judgment
of
heaven
,
filling
the
mind
with
horror
and
compassion
.
<EOS>
I
could
hardly
refrain
from
shedding
tears
at
this
dismal
spectacle
,
when
I
recalled
the
idea
of
what
it
was
about
eighteen
months
ago
.
  
<EOS>
As
we
stayed
all
night
at
Frejus
,
I
had
an
opportunity
of
viewing
the
amphitheatre
at
leisure
.
<EOS>
As
near
as
I
can
judge
by
the
eye
,
it
is
of
the
same
dimensions
with
that
of
Nismes
;
but
shockingly
dilapidated
.
<EOS>
The
stone
seats
rising
from
the
arena
are
still
extant
,
and
the
cells
under
them
,
where
the
wild
beasts
were
kept
.
<EOS>
There
are
likewise
the
remains
of
two
galleries
one
over
another
;
and
two
vomitoria
or
great
gateways
at
opposite
sides
of
the
arena
,
which
is
now
a
fine
green
,
with
a
road
through
the
middle
of
it
:
but
all
the
external
architecture
and
the
ornaments
are
demolished
.
<EOS>
The
most
intire
part
of
the
wall
now
constitutes
part
of
a
monastery
,
the
monks
of
which
,
I
am
told
,
have
helped
to
destroy
the
amphitheatre
,
by
removing
the
stones
for
their
own
purposes
of
building
.
<EOS>
In
the
neighbourhood
of
this
amphitheatre
,
which
stands
without
the
walls
,
are
the
vestiges
of
an
old
edifice
,
said
to
have
been
the
palace
where
the
imperator
or
president
resided
:
for
it
was
a
Roman
colony
,
much
favoured
by
Julius
Caesar
,
who
gave
it
the
name
of
Forum
Julii
,
and
Civitas
Forojuliensis
.
<EOS>
In
all
probability
,
it
was
he
who
built
the
amphitheatre
,
and
brought
hither
the
water
ten
leagues
from
the
river
of
Ciagne
,
by
means
of
an
aqueduct
,
some
arcades
of
which
are
still
standing
on
the
other
side
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
A
great
number
of
statues
were
found
in
this
place
,
together
with
antient
inscriptions
,
which
have
been
published
by
different
authors
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
tell
you
that
Julius
Agricola
,
the
father
-
in
-
law
of
Tacitus
,
the
historian
,
was
a
native
of
Frejus
,
which
is
now
a
very
poor
inconsiderable
place
.
<EOS>
From
hence
the
country
opens
to
the
left
,
forming
an
extensive
plain
between
the
sea
and
the
mountains
,
which
are
a
continuation
of
the
Alps
,
that
stretches
through
Provence
and
Dauphine
.
<EOS>
This
plain
watered
with
pleasant
streams
,
and
varied
with
vineyards
,
corn
-
fields
,
and
meadow
-
ground
,
afforded
a
most
agreeable
prospect
to
our
eyes
,
which
were
accustomed
to
the
sight
of
scorching
sands
,
rugged
rocks
,
and
abrupt
mountains
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Nice
.
<EOS>
Although
this
has
much
the
appearance
of
a
corn
-
country
,
I
am
told
it
does
not
produce
enough
for
the
consumption
of
its
inhabitants
,
who
are
obliged
to
have
annual
supplies
from
abroad
,
imported
at
Marseilles
.
<EOS>
A
Frenchman
,
at
an
average
,
eats
three
times
the
quantity
of
bread
that
satisfies
a
native
of
England
,
and
indeed
it
is
undoubtedly
the
staff
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
I
am
therefore
surprised
that
the
Provencaux
do
not
convert
part
of
their
vineyards
into
corn
-
fields
:
for
they
may
boast
of
their
wine
as
they
please
;
but
that
which
is
drank
by
the
common
people
,
not
only
here
,
but
also
in
all
the
wine
countries
of
France
,
is
neither
so
strong
,
nourishing
,
nor
(
in
my
opinion
)
<EOS>
so
pleasant
to
the
taste
as
the
small
-
beer
of
England
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
owned
that
all
the
peasants
who
have
wine
for
their
ordinary
drink
are
of
a
diminutive
size
,
in
comparison
of
those
who
use
milk
,
beer
,
or
even
water
;
and
it
is
a
constant
observation
,
that
when
there
is
a
scarcity
of
wine
,
the
common
people
are
always
more
healthy
,
than
in
those
seasons
when
it
abounds
.
<EOS>
The
longer
I
live
,
the
more
I
am
convinced
that
wine
,
and
all
fermented
liquors
,
are
pernicious
to
the
human
constitution
;
and
that
for
the
preservation
of
health
,
and
exhilaration
of
the
spirits
,
there
is
no
beverage
comparable
to
simple
water
.
<EOS>
Between
Luc
and
Toulon
,
the
country
is
delightfully
parcelled
out
into
inclosures
.
<EOS>
Here
is
plenty
of
rich
pasturage
for
black
cattle
,
and
a
greater
number
of
pure
streams
and
rivulets
than
I
have
observed
in
any
other
parts
of
France
.
  
<EOS>
Toulon
is
a
considerable
place
,
even
exclusive
of
the
basin
,
docks
,
and
arsenal
,
which
indeed
are
such
as
justify
the
remark
made
by
a
stranger
when
he
viewed
them
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
king
of
France
(
said
he
)
is
greater
at
Toulon
than
at
Versailles
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
quay
,
the
jetties
,
the
docks
,
and
magazines
,
are
contrived
and
executed
with
precision
,
order
,
solidity
,
and
magnificence
.
<EOS>
I
counted
fourteen
ships
of
the
line
lying
unrigged
in
the
basin
,
besides
the
Tonant
of
eighty
guns
,
which
was
in
dock
repairing
,
and
a
new
frigate
on
the
stocks
.
<EOS>
I
was
credibly
informed
that
in
the
last
war
,
the
king
of
France
was
so
ill
-
served
with
cannon
for
his
navy
,
that
in
every
action
there
was
scarce
a
ship
which
had
not
several
pieces
burst
.
<EOS>
These
accidents
did
great
damage
,
and
discouraged
the
French
mariners
to
such
a
degree
,
that
they
became
more
afraid
of
their
own
guns
than
of
those
of
the
English
.
<EOS>
There
are
now
at
Toulon
above
two
thousand
pieces
of
iron
cannon
unfit
for
service
.
<EOS>
This
is
an
undeniable
proof
of
the
weakness
and
neglect
of
the
French
administration
:
but
a
more
suprizing
proof
of
their
imbecility
,
is
the
state
of
the
fortifications
that
defend
the
entrance
of
this
very
harbour
.
<EOS>
I
have
some
reason
to
think
that
they
trusted
for
its
security
entirely
to
our
opinion
that
it
must
be
inaccessible
.
<EOS>
Capt
E
 
,
of
one
of
our
frigates
,
lately
entered
the
harbour
with
a
contrary
wind
,
which
by
obliging
him
to
tack
,
afforded
an
opportunity
of
sounding
the
whole
breadth
and
length
of
the
passage
.
<EOS>
He
came
in
without
a
pilot
,
and
made
a
pretence
of
buying
cordage
,
or
some
other
stores
;
but
the
French
officers
were
much
chagrined
at
the
boldness
of
his
enterprize
.
<EOS>
They
alleged
that
he
came
for
no
other
reason
but
to
sound
the
channel
;
and
that
he
had
an
engineer
aboard
,
who
made
drawings
of
the
land
and
the
forts
,
their
bearings
and
distances
.
<EOS>
In
all
probability
,
these
suspicions
were
communicated
to
the
ministry
;
for
an
order
immediately
arrived
,
that
no
stranger
should
be
admitted
into
the
docks
and
arsenal
.
  
<EOS>
Part
of
the
road
from
hence
to
Marseilles
lies
through
a
vast
mountain
,
which
resembles
that
of
Estrelles
;
but
is
not
so
well
covered
with
wood
,
though
it
has
the
advantage
of
an
agreeable
stream
running
through
the
bottom
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
much
pleased
with
Marseilles
,
which
is
indeed
a
noble
city
,
large
,
populous
,
and
flourishing
.
<EOS>
The
streets
of
what
is
called
the
new
Town
are
open
,
airy
and
spacious
;
the
houses
well
built
,
and
even
magnificent
.
<EOS>
The
harbour
is
an
oval
basin
,
surrounded
on
every
side
either
by
the
buildings
or
the
land
,
so
that
the
shipping
lies
perfectly
secure
;
and
here
is
generally
an
incredible
number
of
vessels
.
<EOS>
On
the
city
side
,
there
is
a
semi
-
circular
quay
of
free
-
stone
,
which
extends
thirteen
hundred
paces
;
and
the
space
between
this
and
the
houses
that
front
it
,
is
continually
filled
with
a
surprising
crowd
of
people
.
<EOS>
The
gallies
,
to
the
number
of
eight
or
nine
,
are
moored
with
their
sterns
to
one
part
of
the
wharf
,
and
the
slaves
are
permitted
to
work
for
their
own
benefit
at
their
respective
occupations
,
in
little
shops
or
booths
,
which
they
rent
for
a
trifle
.
<EOS>
There
you
see
tradesmen
of
all
kinds
sitting
at
work
,
chained
by
one
foot
,
shoe
-
makers
,
taylors
,
silversmiths
,
watch
and
clock
-
makers
,
barbers
,
stocking
-
weavers
,
jewellers
,
pattern
-
drawers
,
scriveners
,
booksellers
,
cutlers
,
and
all
manner
of
shop
-
keepers
.
<EOS>
They
pay
about
two
sols
a
day
to
the
king
for
this
indulgence
;
live
well
and
look
jolly
;
and
can
afford
to
sell
their
goods
and
labour
much
cheaper
than
other
dealers
and
tradesmen
.
<EOS>
At
night
,
however
,
they
are
obliged
to
lie
aboard
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
great
face
of
business
at
Marseilles
,
their
trade
is
greatly
on
the
decline
;
and
their
merchants
are
failing
every
day
.
<EOS>
This
decay
of
commerce
is
in
a
great
measure
owing
to
the
English
,
who
,
at
the
peace
,
poured
in
such
a
quantity
of
European
merchandize
into
Martinique
and
Guadalupe
,
that
when
the
merchants
of
Marseilles
sent
over
their
cargoes
,
they
found
the
markets
overstocked
,
and
were
obliged
to
sell
for
a
considerable
loss
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
the
French
colonists
had
such
a
stock
of
sugars
,
coffee
,
and
other
commodities
lying
by
them
during
the
war
,
that
upon
the
first
notice
of
peace
,
they
shipped
them
off
in
great
quantities
for
Marseilles
.
<EOS>
I
am
told
that
the
produce
of
the
islands
is
at
present
cheaper
here
than
where
it
grows
;
and
on
the
other
hand
the
merchandize
of
this
country
sells
for
less
money
at
Martinique
than
in
Provence
.
  
<EOS>
A
single
person
,
who
travels
in
this
country
,
may
live
at
a
reasonable
rate
in
these
towns
,
by
eating
at
the
public
ordinaries
:
but
I
would
advise
all
families
that
come
hither
to
make
any
stay
,
to
take
furnished
lodgings
as
soon
as
they
can
:
for
the
expence
of
living
at
an
hotel
is
enormous
.
<EOS>
I
was
obliged
to
pay
at
Marseilles
four
livres
a
head
for
every
meal
,
and
half
that
price
for
my
servant
,
and
was
charged
six
livres
a
day
besides
for
the
apartment
,
so
that
our
daily
expence
,
including
breakfast
and
a
valet
de
place
,
amounted
to
two
loui'dores
.
<EOS>
The
same
imposition
prevails
all
over
the
south
of
France
,
though
it
is
generally
supposed
to
be
the
cheapest
and
most
plentiful
part
of
the
kingdom
.
<EOS>
Without
all
doubt
,
it
must
be
owing
to
the
folly
and
extravagance
of
English
travellers
,
who
have
allowed
themselves
to
be
fleeced
without
wincing
,
until
this
extortion
is
become
authorized
by
custom
.
<EOS>
It
is
very
disagreeable
riding
in
the
avenues
of
Marseilles
,
because
you
are
confined
in
a
dusty
high
road
,
crouded
with
carriages
and
beasts
of
burden
,
between
two
white
walls
,
the
reflection
from
which
,
while
the
sun
shines
,
is
intolerable
.
<EOS>
But
in
this
neighbourhood
there
is
a
vast
number
of
pleasant
country
-
houses
,
called
Bastides
,
said
to
amount
to
twelve
thousand
,
some
of
which
may
be
rented
ready
furnished
at
a
very
reasonable
price
.
<EOS>
Marseilles
is
a
gay
city
,
and
the
inhabitants
indulge
themselves
in
a
variety
of
amusements
.
<EOS>
They
have
assemblies
,
a
concert
spirituel
,
and
a
comedy
.
<EOS>
Here
is
also
a
spacious
cours
,
or
walk
shaded
with
trees
,
to
which
in
the
evening
there
is
a
great
resort
of
well
-
dressed
people
.
  
<EOS>
Marseilles
being
a
free
port
,
there
is
a
bureau
about
half
a
league
from
the
city
on
the
road
to
Aix
,
where
all
carriages
undergo
examination
;
and
if
any
thing
contraband
is
found
,
the
vehicle
,
baggage
,
and
even
the
horses
are
confiscated
.
<EOS>
We
escaped
this
disagreeable
ceremony
by
the
sagacity
of
our
driver
.
<EOS>
Of
his
own
accord
,
he
declared
at
the
bureau
,
that
we
had
bought
a
pound
of
coffee
and
some
sugar
at
Marseilles
,
and
were
ready
to
pay
the
duty
,
which
amounted
to
about
ten
sols
.
<EOS>
They
took
the
money
,
gave
him
a
receipt
,
and
let
the
carriage
pass
,
without
further
question
.
  
<EOS>
I
proposed
to
stay
one
night
only
at
Aix
:
but
Mr
A
 
r
,
who
is
here
,
had
found
such
benefit
from
drinking
the
waters
,
that
I
was
persuaded
to
make
trial
of
them
for
eight
or
ten
days
.
<EOS>
I
have
accordingly
taken
private
lodgings
,
and
drank
them
at
the
fountain
-
head
,
not
without
finding
considerable
benefit
.
<EOS>
In
my
next
I
shall
say
something
further
of
these
waters
,
though
I
am
afraid
they
will
not
prove
a
source
of
much
entertainment
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
sufficient
for
me
to
find
them
contribute
in
any
degree
to
the
health
of
 
Dear
Sir
,
Yours
assuredly

DEAR
DOCTOR
,
 
I
found
three
English
families
at
Aix
,
with
whom
I
could
have
passed
my
time
very
agreeably
<EOS>
but
the
society
is
now
dissolved
.
<EOS>
Mr
S
 
re
and
his
lady
left
the
place
in
a
few
days
after
we
arrived
.
<EOS>
Mr
A
 
r
and
lady
Betty
are
gone
to
Geneva
;
and
Mr
G
 
r
with
his
family
remains
at
Aix
.
<EOS>
This
gentleman
,
who
laboured
under
a
most
dreadful
nervous
asthma
,
has
obtained
such
relief
from
this
climate
,
that
he
intends
to
stay
another
year
in
the
place
:
and
Mr
A
 
r
found
surprizing
benefit
from
drinking
the
waters
,
for
a
scorbutical
complaint
.
<EOS>
As
I
was
incommoded
by
both
these
disorders
,
I
could
not
but
in
justice
to
myself
,
try
the
united
efforts
of
the
air
and
the
waters
;
especially
as
this
consideration
was
re
-
inforced
by
the
kind
and
pressing
exhortations
of
Mr
A

Betty

which
I
could
not
in
gratitude
resist

Aix
,
the
capital
of
Provence
,
is
a
large
city
,
watered
by
the
small
river
<EOS>
Are
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
Roman
colony
,
said
to
be
founded
by
Caius
Sextus
Calvinus
,
above
a
century
before
the
birth
of
Christ
.
<EOS>
From
the
source
of
mineral
water
here
found
,
added
to
the
consul
's
name
,
it
was
called
Aquae
Sextiae
.
<EOS>
It
was
here
that
Marius
,
the
conqueror
of
the
Teutones
,
fixed
his
headquarters
,
and
embellished
the
place
with
temples
,
aqueducts
,
and
thermae
,
of
which
,
however
,
nothing
now
remains
.
<EOS>
The
city
,
as
it
now
stands
,
is
well
built
,
though
the
streets
in
general
are
narrow
,
and
kept
in
a
very
dirty
condition
.
<EOS>
But
it
has
a
noble
cours
planted
with
double
rows
of
tall
trees
,
and
adorned
with
three
or
four
fine
fountains
,
the
middlemost
of
which
discharges
hot
water
supplied
from
the
source
of
the
baths
.
<EOS>
On
each
side
there
is
a
row
of
elegant
houses
,
inhabited
chiefly
by
the
noblesse
,
of
which
there
is
here
a
considerable
number
.
<EOS>
The
parliament
,
which
is
held
at
Aix
,
brings
hither
a
great
resort
of
people
;
and
as
many
of
the
inhabitants
are
persons
of
fashion
,
they
are
well
bred
,
gay
,
and
sociable
.
<EOS>
The
duc
de
Villars
,
who
is
governor
of
the
province
,
resides
on
the
spot
,
and
keeps
an
open
assembly
,
where
strangers
are
admitted
without
reserve
,
and
made
very
welcome
,
if
they
will
engage
in
play
,
which
is
the
sole
occupation
of
the
whole
company
.
<EOS>
Some
of
our
English
people
complain
,
that
when
they
were
presented
to
him
,
they
met
with
a
very
cold
reception
.
<EOS>
The
French
,
as
well
as
other
foreigners
,
have
no
idea
of
a
man
of
family
and
fashion
,
without
the
title
of
duke
,
count
,
marquis
,
or
lord
,
and
where
an
English
gentleman
is
introduced
by
the
simple
expression
of
monsieur
tel
<EOS>
,
Mr
Suchathing
,
they
think
he
is
some
plebeian
,
unworthy
of
any
particular
attention
.
  
<EOS>
Aix
is
situated
in
a
bottom
,
almost
surrounded
by
hills
,
which
,
however
,
do
not
screen
it
from
the
Bize
,
or
north
wind
,
that
blows
extremely
sharp
in
the
winter
and
spring
,
rendering
the
air
almost
insupportably
cold
,
and
very
dangerous
to
those
who
have
some
kinds
of
pulmonary
complaints
,
such
as
tubercules
,
abscesses
,
or
spitting
of
blood
.
<EOS>
Lord
H
 
,
who
passed
part
of
last
winter
in
this
place
,
afflicted
with
some
of
these
symptoms
,
grew
worse
every
day
while
he
continued
at
Aix
:
<EOS>
but
,
he
no
sooner
removed
to
Marseilles
,
than
all
his
complaints
abated
;
such
a
difference
there
is
in
the
air
of
these
two
places
,
though
the
distance
between
them
does
not
exceed
ten
or
twelve
miles
.
<EOS>
But
the
air
of
Marseilles
,
though
much
more
mild
than
that
of
Aix
in
the
winter
is
not
near
so
warm
as
the
climate
of
Nice
,
where
we
find
in
plenty
such
flowers
,
fruit
,
and
vegetables
,
even
in
the
severest
season
,
as
will
not
grow
and
ripen
,
either
at
Marseilles
or
Toulon
.
  
<EOS>
If
the
air
of
Aix
is
disagreeably
cold
in
the
winter
,
it
is
rendered
quite
insufferable
in
the
summer
,
from
excessive
heat
,
occasioned
by
the
reflexion
from
the
rocks
and
mountains
,
which
at
the
same
time
obstruct
the
circulation
of
air
:
<EOS>
for
it
must
be
observed
,
that
the
same
mountains
which
serve
as
funnels
and
canals
,
to
collect
and
discharge
the
keen
blasts
of
winter
,
will
provide
screens
to
intercept
intirely
the
faint
breezes
of
summer
.
<EOS>
Aix
,
though
pretty
well
provided
with
butcher
's
meat
,
is
very
ill
supplied
with
potherbs
;
and
they
have
no
poultry
but
what
comes
at
a
vast
distance
from
the
Lionnois
.
<EOS>
They
say
their
want
of
roots
,
cabbage
,
cauliflower
,
etc
.
<EOS>
is
owing
to
a
scarcity
of
water
:
<EOS>
but
the
truth
is
,
they
are
very
bad
gardeners
.
<EOS>
Their
oil
is
good
and
cheap
:
their
wine
is
indifferent
:
but
their
chief
care
seems
employed
on
the
culture
of
silk
,
the
staple
of
Provence
,
which
is
every
where
shaded
with
plantations
of
mulberry
trees
,
for
the
nourishment
of
the
worms
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
boasted
cheapness
of
every
article
of
housekeeping
,
in
the
south
of
France
,
I
am
persuaded
a
family
may
live
for
less
money
at
York
,
Durham
,
Hereford
,
and
in
many
other
cities
of
England
than
at
Aix
in
Provence
;
keep
a
more
plentiful
table
;
and
be
much
more
comfortably
situated
in
all
respects
.
<EOS>
I
found
lodging
and
provision
at
Aix
fifty
per
cent
dearer
than
at
Montpellier
,
which
is
counted
the
dearest
place
in
Languedoc
.
  
<EOS>
The
baths
of
Aix
,
so
famous
in
antiquity
,
were
quite
demolished
by
the
irruptions
of
the
barbarians
.
<EOS>
The
very
source
of
the
water
was
lost
,
till
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
(
I
think
the
year
1704
)
,
when
it
was
discovered
by
accident
,
in
digging
for
the
foundation
of
a
house
,
at
the
foot
of
a
hill
,
just
without
the
city
wall
.
<EOS>
Near
the
same
place
was
found
a
small
stone
altar
,
with
the
figure
of
a
Priapus
,
and
some
letters
in
capitals
,
which
the
antiquarians
have
differently
interpreted
.
<EOS>
From
this
figure
,
it
was
supposed
that
the
waters
were
efficacious
in
cases
of
barrenness
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
long
time
,
however
,
before
any
person
would
venture
to
use
them
internally
,
as
it
did
not
appear
that
they
had
ever
been
drank
by
the
antients
.
<EOS>
On
their
re
-
appearance
,
they
were
chiefly
used
for
baths
to
horses
,
and
other
beasts
which
had
the
mange
,
and
other
cutaneous
eruptions
.
<EOS>
At
length
poor
people
began
to
bathe
in
them
for
the
same
disorders
,
and
received
such
benefit
from
them
,
as
attracted
the
attention
of
more
curious
inquirers
.
<EOS>
A
very
superficial
and
imperfect
analysis
was
made
and
published
,
with
a
few
remarkable
histories
of
the
cures
they
had
performed
,
by
three
different
physicians
of
those
days
;
and
those
little
treatises
,
I
suppose
,
encouraged
valetudinarians
to
drink
them
without
ceremony
.
<EOS>
They
were
found
serviceable
in
the
gout
,
the
gravel
,
scurvy
,
dropsy
,
palsy
,
indigestion
,
asthma
,
and
consumption
;
and
their
fame
soon
extended
itself
all
over
Languedoc
,
Gascony
,
Dauphine
,
and
Provence
.
<EOS>
The
magistrates
,
with
a
view
to
render
them
more
useful
and
commodious
,
have
raised
a
plain
building
,
in
which
there
are
a
couple
of
private
baths
,
with
a
bedchamber
adjoining
to
each
,
where
individuals
may
use
them
both
internally
and
externally
,
for
a
moderate
expence
.
<EOS>
These
baths
are
paved
with
marble
,
and
supplied
with
water
each
by
a
large
brass
cock
,
which
you
can
turn
at
pleasure
.
<EOS>
At
one
end
of
this
edifice
,
there
is
an
octagon
,
open
at
top
,
having
a
bason
,
with
a
stone
pillar
in
the
middle
,
which
discharges
water
from
the
same
source
,
all
round
,
by
eight
small
brass
cocks
;
and
hither
people
of
all
ranks
come
of
a
morning
,
with
their
glasses
,
to
drink
the
water
,
or
wash
their
sores
,
or
subject
their
contracted
limbs
to
the
stream
.
<EOS>
This
last
operation
,
called
the
douche
,
however
,
is
more
effectually
undergone
in
the
private
bath
,
where
the
stream
is
much
more
powerful
.
<EOS>
The
natural
warmth
of
this
water
,
as
nearly
as
I
can
judge
from
recollection
,
is
about
the
same
degree
of
temperature
with
that
in
the
Queen
's
Bath
,
at
Bath
in
Somersetshire
.
<EOS>
It
is
perfectly
transparent
,
sparkling
in
the
glass
,
light
and
agreeable
to
the
taste
,
and
may
be
drank
without
any
preparation
,
to
the
quantity
of
three
or
four
pints
at
a
time
.
<EOS>
There
are
many
people
at
Aix
who
swallow
fourteen
half
pint
glasses
every
morning
,
during
the
season
,
which
is
in
the
month
of
May
,
though
it
may
be
taken
with
equal
benefit
all
the
year
round
.
<EOS>
It
has
no
sensible
operation
but
by
urine
,
an
effect
which
pure
water
would
produce
,
if
drank
in
the
same
quantity
.
  
<EOS>
If
we
may
believe
those
who
have
published
their
experiments
,
this
water
produces
neither
agitation
,
cloud
,
or
change
of
colour
,
when
mixed
with
acids
,
alkalies
,
tincture
of
galls
,
syrup
of
violets
,
or
solution
of
silver
.
<EOS>
The
residue
,
after
boiling
,
evaporation
,
and
filtration
,
affords
a
very
small
proportion
of
purging
salt
,
and
calcarious
earth
,
which
last
ferments
with
strong
acids
.
<EOS>
As
I
had
neither
hydrometer
nor
thermometer
to
ascertain
the
weight
and
warmth
of
this
water
;
nor
time
to
procure
the
proper
utensils
,
to
make
the
preparations
,
and
repeat
the
experiments
necessary
to
exhibit
a
complete
analysis
,
I
did
not
pretend
to
enter
upon
this
process
;
but
contented
myself
with
drinking
,
bathing
,
and
using
the
douche
,
which
perfectly
answered
my
expectation
,
having
,
in
eight
days
,
almost
cured
an
ugly
scorbutic
tetter
,
which
had
for
some
time
deprived
me
of
the
use
of
my
right
hand
.
<EOS>
I
observed
that
the
water
,
when
used
externally
,
left
always
a
kind
of
oily
appearance
on
the
skin
:
that
when
,
we
boiled
it
at
home
,
in
an
earthen
pot
,
the
steams
smelled
like
those
of
sulphur
,
and
even
affected
my
lungs
in
the
same
manner
:
but
the
bath
itself
smelled
strong
of
a
lime
-
kiln
.
<EOS>
The
water
,
after
standing
all
night
in
a
bottle
,
yielded
a
remarkably
vinous
taste
and
odour
,
something
analogous
to
that
of
dulcified
spirit
of
nitre
.
<EOS>
Whether
the
active
particles
consist
of
a
volatile
vitriol
,
or
a
very
fine
petroleum
,
or
a
mixture
of
both
,
I
shall
not
pretend
to
determine
:
but
the
best
way
I
know
of
discovering
whether
it
is
really
impregnated
with
a
vitriolic
principle
,
too
subtil
and
fugitive
for
the
usual
operations
of
chymistry
,
is
to
place
bottles
,
filled
with
wine
,
in
the
bath
,
or
adjacent
room
,
which
wine
,
if
there
is
really
a
volatile
acid
,
in
any
considerable
quantity
,
will
be
pricked
in
eight
and
forty
hours
.
  
<EOS>
Having
ordered
our
coach
to
be
refitted
,
and
provided
with
fresh
horses
,
as
well
as
with
another
postilion
,
in
consequence
of
which
improvements
,
I
payed
at
the
rate
of
a
loui'dore
per
diem
to
Lyons
and
back
again
,
we
departed
from
Aix
,
and
<EOS>
the
second
day
of
our
journey
passing
the
Durance
in
a
boat
,
lay
at
Avignon
.
<EOS>
This
river
,
the
Druentia
of
the
antients
,
is
a
considerable
stream
,
extremely
rapid
,
which
descends
from
the
mountains
,
and
discharges
itself
in
the
Rhone
.
<EOS>
After
violent
rains
it
extends
its
channel
,
so
as
to
be
impassable
,
and
often
overflows
the
country
to
a
great
extent
.
<EOS>
In
the
middle
of
a
plain
,
betwixt
Orgon
and
this
river
,
we
met
the
coach
in
which
we
had
travelled
eighteen
months
before
,
from
Lyons
to
Montpellier
,
conducted
by
our
old
driver
Joseph
,
who
no
sooner
recognized
my
servant
at
a
distance
,
by
his
musquetoon
,
than
he
came
running
towards
our
carriage
,
and
seizing
my
hand
,
even
shed
tears
of
joy
.
<EOS>
Joseph
had
been
travelling
through
Spain
,
and
was
so
imbrowned
by
the
sun
,
that
he
might
have
passed
for
an
Iroquois
.
<EOS>
I
was
much
pleased
with
the
marks
of
gratitude
which
the
poor
fellow
expressed
towards
his
benefactors
.
<EOS>
He
had
some
private
conversation
with
our
voiturier
,
whose
name
was
Claude
,
to
whom
he
gave
such
a
favourable
character
of
us
,
as
in
all
probability
induced
him
to
be
wonderfully
obliging
during
the
whole
journey
.
  
<EOS>
You
know
Avignon
is
a
large
city
belonging
to
the
pope
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
Avenio
Cavarum
of
the
antients
,
and
changed
masters
several
times
,
belonging
successively
to
the
Romans
,
Burgundians
,
Franks
,
the
kingdom
of
Arles
,
the
counts
of
Provence
,
and
the
sovereigns
of
Naples
.
<EOS>
It
was
sold
in
the
fourteenth
century
,
by
queen
Jane
<EOS>
I
of
Naples
,
to
Pope
Clement
VI
for
the
sum
of
eighty
thousand
florins
,
and
since
that
period
has
continued
under
the
dominion
of
the
see
of
Rome
.
<EOS>
Not
but
that
when
the
duc
de
Crequi
,
the
French
ambassador
,
was
insulted
at
Rome
in
the
year
1662
,
the
parliament
of
Provence
passed
an
arret
,
declaring
the
city
of
Avignon
,
and
the
county
Venaiss
in
part
of
the
ancient
domain
of
Provence
;
and
therefore
reunited
it
to
the
crown
of
France
,
which
accordingly
took
possession
;
though
it
was
afterwards
restored
to
the
Roman
see
at
the
peace
of
Pisa
.
<EOS>
The
pope
,
however
,
holds
it
by
a
precarious
title
,
at
the
mercy
of
the
French
king
,
who
may
one
day
be
induced
to
resume
it
,
upon
payment
of
the
original
purchase
-
money
.
<EOS>
As
a
succession
of
popes
resided
here
for
the
space
of
seventy
years
,
the
city
could
not
fail
to
be
adorned
with
a
great
number
of
magnificent
churches
and
convents
,
which
are
richly
embellished
with
painting
,
sculpture
,
shrines
,
reliques
,
and
tombs
.
<EOS>
Among
the
last
,
is
that
of
the
celebrated
Laura
,
whom
Petrarch
has
immortalized
by
his
poetry
,
and
for
whom
Francis
I
of
France
took
the
trouble
to
write
an
epitaph
.
<EOS>
Avignon
is
governed
by
a
vice
-
legate
from
the
pope
,
and
the
police
of
the
city
is
regulated
by
the
consuls
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
a
large
place
,
situated
in
a
fruitful
plain
,
surrounded
by
high
walls
built
of
hewn
stone
,
which
on
the
west
side
are
washed
by
the
Rhone
.
<EOS>
Here
was
a
noble
bridge
over
the
river
,
but
it
is
now
in
ruins
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
side
,
a
branch
of
the
Sorgue
runs
through
part
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
This
is
the
river
anciently
called
Sulga
,
formed
by
the
famous
fountain
of
Vaucluse
in
this
neighbourhood
,
where
the
poet
Petrarch
resided
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
charming
transparent
stream
,
abounding
with
excellent
trout
and
craw
-
fish
.
<EOS>
We
passed
over
it
on
a
stone
bridge
,
in
our
way
to
Orange
,
the
Arausio
Cavarum
of
the
Romans
,
still
distinguished
by
some
noble
monuments
of
antiquity
.
<EOS>
These
consist
of
a
circus
,
an
aqueduct
,
a
temple
,
and
a
triumphal
arch
,
which
last
was
erected
in
honour
of
Caius
Marius
,
and
Luctatius
Catulus
,
after
the
great
victory
they
obtained
in
this
country
over
the
Cimbri
and
Teutones
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
very
magnificent
edifice
,
adorned
on
all
sides
with
trophies
and
battles
in
basso
relievo
.
<EOS>
The
ornaments
of
the
architecture
,
and
the
sculpture
,
are
wonderfully
elegant
for
the
time
in
which
it
was
erected
;
and
the
whole
is
surprisingly
well
preserved
,
considering
its
great
antiquity
.
<EOS>
It
seems
to
me
to
be
as
entire
and
perfect
as
the
arch
of
Septimius
Severus
at
Rome
.
<EOS>
Next
day
we
passed
two
very
impetuous
streams
,
the
Drome
and
the
Isere
.
<EOS>
The
first
,
which
very
much
resembles
the
Var
<EOS>
,
we
forded
:
but
<EOS>
the
Isere
we
crossed
in
a
boat
,
which
as
well
as
that
upon
the
Durance
,
is
managed
by
the
traille
,
a
moveable
or
running
pulley
,
on
a
rope
stretched
between
two
wooden
machines
erected
on
the
opposite
sides
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
The
contrivance
is
simple
and
effectual
,
and
the
passage
equally
safe
and
expeditious
.
<EOS>
The
boatman
has
nothing
to
do
,
but
by
means
of
a
long
massy
rudder
,
to
keep
the
head
obliquely
to
the
stream
,
the
force
of
which
pushes
the
boat
along
,
the
block
to
which
it
is
fixed
sliding
upon
the
rope
from
one
side
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
All
these
rivers
take
their
rise
from
the
mountains
,
which
are
continued
through
Provence
and
Dauphine
,
and
fall
into
the
Rhone
:
and
all
of
them
,
when
swelled
by
sudden
rains
,
overflow
the
flat
country
.
<EOS>
Although
Dauphine
affords
little
or
no
oil
,
it
produces
excellent
wines
,
particularly
those
of
Hermitage
and
Cote
-
roti
.
<EOS>
The
first
of
these
is
sold
on
the
spot
for
three
livres
the
bottle
,
and
the
other
for
two
.
<EOS>
The
country
likewise
yields
a
considerable
quantity
of
corn
,
and
a
good
deal
of
grass
.
<EOS>
It
is
well
watered
with
streams
,
and
agreeably
shaded
with
wood
.
<EOS>
The
weather
was
pleasant
,
and
we
had
a
continued
song
of
nightingales
from
Aix
to
Fontainebleau
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
pretend
to
specify
the
antiquities
of
Vienne
,
antiently
called
Vienna
Allobrogum
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
Roman
colony
,
and
a
considerable
city
,
which
the
antients
spared
no
pains
and
expence
to
embellish
.
<EOS>
It
is
still
a
large
town
,
standing
among
several
hills
on
the
banks
of
the
Rhone
,
though
all
its
former
splendor
is
eclipsed
,
its
commerce
decayed
,
and
most
of
its
antiquities
are
buried
in
ruins
.
<EOS>
The
church
of
Notre
Dame
<EOS>
de
la
Vie
was
undoubtedly
a
temple
.
<EOS>
On
the
left
of
the
road
,
as
you
enter
it
,
by
the
gate
of
Avignon
,
there
is
a
handsome
obelisk
,
or
rather
pyramid
,
about
thirty
feet
high
,
raised
upon
a
vault
supported
by
four
pillars
of
the
Tuscan
order
.
<EOS>
It
is
certainly
a
Roman
work
,
and
Montfaucon
supposes
it
to
be
a
tomb
,
as
he
perceived
an
oblong
stone
jetting
out
from
the
middle
of
the
vault
,
in
which
the
ashes
of
the
defunct
were
probably
contained
.
<EOS>
The
story
of
Pontius
Pilate
,
who
is
said
to
have
ended
his
days
in
this
place
,
is
a
fable
.
<EOS>
On
the
seventh
day
of
our
journey
from
Aix
,
we
arrived
at
Lyons
,
where
I
shall
take
my
leave
of
you
for
the
present
,
being
with
great
truth
 
Yours
,
etc
.
   
<EOS>
BOULOGNE
,
June

.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
SIR
,
 
I
am
at
last
in
a
situation
to
indulge
my
view
with
a
sight
of
Britain
,
after
an
absence
of
two
years
;
and
indeed
you
can
not
imagine
what
pleasure
I
feel
while
I
survey
the
white
cliffs
of
Dover
,
at
this
distance
.
<EOS>
Not
that
I
am
at
all
affected
by
the
nescia
qua
dulcedine
natalis
soli
,
of
Horace
.
<EOS>
That
seems
to
be
a
kind
of
fanaticism
founded
on
the
prejudices
of
education
,
which
induces
a
Laplander
to
place
the
terrestrial
paradise
among
the
snows
of
Norway
,
and
a
Swiss
to
prefer
the
barren
mountains
of
Solleure
to
the
fruitful
plains
of
Lombardy
.
<EOS>
I
am
attached
to
my
country
,
because
it
is
the
land
of
liberty
,
cleanliness
,
and
convenience
:
<EOS>
but
I
love
it
still
more
tenderly
,
as
the
scene
of
all
my
interesting
connexions
;
as
the
habitation
of
my
friends
,
for
whose
conversation
,
correspondence
,
and
esteem
,
I
wish
alone
to
live
.
  
<EOS>
Our
journey
hither
from
Lyons
produced
neither
accident
nor
adventure
worth
notice
;
but
abundance
of
little
vexations
,
which
may
be
termed
the
Plagues
of
Posting
.
<EOS>
At
Lyons
,
where
we
stayed
only
a
few
days
,
I
found
a
return
-
coach
,
which
I
hired
to
Paris
for
six
loui'dores
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
fine
roomy
carriage
,
elegantly
furnished
,
and
made
for
travelling
;
so
strong
and
solid
in
all
its
parts
,
that
there
was
no
danger
of
its
being
shaken
to
pieces
by
the
roughness
of
the
road
:
but
its
weight
and
solidity
occasioned
so
much
friction
between
the
wheels
and
the
axle
-
tree
,
that
we
ran
the
risque
of
being
set
on
fire
three
or
four
times
a
day
.
<EOS>
Upon
a
just
comparison
of
all
circumstances
posting
is
much
more
easy
,
convenient
,
and
reasonable
in
England
than
in
France
.
<EOS>
The
English
carriages
,
horses
,
harness
,
and
roads
are
much
better
;
and
the
postilions
more
obliging
and
alert
.
<EOS>
The
reason
is
plain
and
obvious
.
<EOS>
If
I
am
ill
-
used
at
the
post
-
house
in
England
,
I
can
be
accommodated
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
The
publicans
on
the
road
are
sensible
of
this
,
and
therefore
they
vie
with
each
other
in
giving
satisfaction
to
travellers
.
<EOS>
But
in
France
,
where
the
post
is
monopolized
,
the
post
-
masters
and
postilions
,
knowing
that
the
traveller
depends
intirely
upon
them
,
are
the
more
negligent
and
remiss
in
their
duty
,
as
well
as
the
more
encouraged
to
insolence
and
imposition
.
<EOS>
Indeed
the
stranger
seems
to
be
left
intirely
at
the
mercy
of
those
fellows
,
except
in
large
towns
,
where
he
may
have
recourse
to
the
magistrate
or
commanding
officer
.
<EOS>
The
post
stands
very
often
by
itself
in
a
lone
country
situation
,
or
in
a
paultry
village
,
where
the
post
-
master
is
the
principal
inhabitant
;
and
in
such
a
case
,
if
you
should
be
ill
-
treated
,
by
being
supplied
with
bad
horses
;
if
you
should
be
delayed
on
frivolous
pretences
,
in
order
to
extort
money
;
if
the
postilions
should
drive
at
a
waggon
pace
,
with
a
view
to
provoke
your
impatience
;
or
should
you
in
any
shape
be
insulted
by
them
or
their
masters
;
and
I
know
not
any
redress
you
can
have
,
except
by
a
formal
complaint
to
the
comptroller
of
the
posts
,
who
is
generally
one
of
the
ministers
of
state
,
and
pays
little
or
no
regard
to
any
such
representations
.
<EOS>
I
know
an
English
gentleman
,
the
brother
of
an
earl
,
who
wrote
a
letter
of
complaint
to
the
Duc
de
Villars
,
governor
of
Provence
,
against
the
post
-
master
of
Antibes
,
who
had
insulted
and
imposed
upon
him
.
<EOS>
The
duke
answered
his
letter
,
promising
to
take
order
that
the
grievance
should
be
redressed
;
and
never
thought
of
it
after
.
<EOS>
Another
great
inconvenience
which
attends
posting
in
France
,
is
that
if
you
are
retarded
by
any
accident
,
you
can
not
in
many
parts
of
the
kingdom
find
a
lodging
,
without
perhaps
travelling
two
or
three
posts
farther
than
you
would
choose
to
go
,
to
the
prejudice
of
your
health
,
and
even
the
hazard
of
your
life
;
whereas
on
any
part
of
the
post
-
road
in
England
,
you
will
meet
with
tolerable
accommodation
at
every
stage
.
<EOS>
Through
the
whole
south
of
France
,
except
in
large
cities
,
the
inns
are
cold
,
damp
,
dark
,
dismal
,
and
dirty
;
the
landlords
equally
disobliging
and
rapacious
;
the
servants
aukward
,
sluttish
,
and
slothful
;
and
the
postilions
lazy
,
lounging
,
greedy
,
and
impertinent
.
<EOS>
If
you
chide
them
for
lingering
,
they
will
continue
to
delay
you
the
longer
:
if
you
chastise
them
with
sword
,
cane
,
cudgel
,
or
horse
-
whip
,
they
will
either
disappear
entirely
,
and
leave
you
without
resource
;
or
they
will
find
means
to
take
vengeance
by
overturning
your
carriage
.
<EOS>
The
best
method
I
know
of
travelling
with
any
degree
of
comfort
,
is
to
allow
yourself
to
become
the
dupe
of
imposition
,
and
stimulate
their
endeavours
by
extraordinary
gratifications
.
<EOS>
I
laid
down
a
resolution
(
and
kept
it
)
to
give
no
more
than
four
and
twenty
sols
per
post
between
the
two
postilions
;
but
I
am
now
persuaded
that
for
three
-
pence
a
post
more
,
I
should
have
been
much
better
served
,
and
should
have
performed
the
journey
with
much
greater
pleasure
.
<EOS>
We
met
with
no
adventures
upon
the
road
worth
reciting
.
<EOS>
The
first
day
we
were
retarded
about
two
hours
by
the
dutchess
D
 
lle
,
and
her
son
the
duc
de
R
 
f
 
t
,
who
by
virtue
of
an
order
from
the
minister
,
had
anticipated
all
the
horses
at
the
post
.
<EOS>
They
accosted
my
servant
,
and
asked
if
his
master
was
a
lord
?
<EOS>
He
thought
proper
to
answer
in
the
affirmative
,
upon
which
the
duke
declared
that
he
must
certainly
be
of
French
extraction
,
inasmuch
as
he
observed
the
lilies
of
France
in
his
arms
on
the
coach
.
<EOS>
This
young
nobleman
spoke
a
little
English
.
<EOS>
He
asked
whence
we
had
come
;
and
understanding
we
had
been
in
Italy
,
desired
to
know
whether
the
man
liked
France
or
Italy
best
?
<EOS>
Upon
his
giving
France
the
preference
,
he
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
,
and
said
he
was
a
lad
of
good
taste
.
<EOS>
The
dutchess
asked
if
her
son
spoke
English
well
,
and
seemed
mightily
pleased
when
my
man
assured
her
he
did
.
<EOS>
They
were
much
more
free
and
condescending
with
my
servant
than
with
myself
;
for
,
though
we
saluted
them
in
passing
,
and
were
even
supposed
to
be
persons
of
quality
,
they
did
not
open
their
lips
,
while
we
stood
close
by
them
at
the
inn
-
door
,
till
their
horses
were
changed
.
<EOS>
They
were
going
to
Geneva
;
and
their
equipage
consisted
of
three
coaches
and
six
,
with
five
domestics
a
-
horseback
.
<EOS>
The
dutchess
was
a
tall
,
thin
,
raw
-
boned
woman
,
with
her
head
close
shaved
.
<EOS>
This
delay
obliged
us
to
lie
two
posts
short
of
Macon
,
at
a
solitary
auberge
called
Maison
Blanche
,
which
had
nothing
white
about
it
,
but
the
name
.
<EOS>
The
Lionnois
is
one
of
the
most
agreeable
and
best
-
cultivated
countries
I
ever
beheld
,
diversified
with
hill
,
dale
,
wood
,
and
water
,
laid
out
in
extensive
corn
-
fields
and
rich
meadows
,
well
stocked
with
black
cattle
,
and
adorned
with
a
surprising
number
of
towns
,
villages
,
villas
,
and
convents
,
generally
situated
on
the
brows
of
gently
swelling
hills
,
so
that
they
appear
to
the
greatest
advantage
.
<EOS>
What
contributes
in
a
great
measure
to
the
beauty
of
this
,
and
the
Maconnois
,
is
the
charming
pastoral
Soame
,
which
from
the
city
of
Chalons
winds
its
silent
course
so
smooth
and
gentle
,
that
one
can
scarce
discern
which
way
its
current
flows
.
<EOS>
It
is
this
placid
appearance
that
tempts
so
many
people
to
bathe
in
it
at
Lions
,
where
a
good
number
of
individuals
are
drowned
every
summer
:
whereas
there
is
no
instance
of
any
persons
thus
perishing
in
the
Rhone
,
the
rapidity
of
it
deterring
every
body
from
bathing
in
its
stream
.
<EOS>
Next
night
we
passed
at
Beaune
where
we
found
nothing
good
but
the
wine
,
for
which
we
paid
forty
sols
the
bottle
.
<EOS>
At
Chalons
our
axle
-
tree
took
fire
;
an
accident
which
detained
us
so
long
,
that
it
was
ten
before
we
arrived
at
Auxerre
,
where
we
lay
.
<EOS>
In
all
probability
we
must
have
lodged
in
the
coach
,
had
not
we
been
content
to
take
four
horses
,
and
pay
for
six
,
two
posts
successively
.
<EOS>
The
alternative
was
,
either
to
proceed
with
four
on
those
terms
,
or
stay
till
the
other
horses
should
come
in
and
be
refreshed
.
<EOS>
In
such
an
emergency
,
I
would
advise
the
traveller
to
put
up
with
the
four
,
and
he
will
find
the
postilions
so
much
upon
their
mettle
,
that
those
stages
will
be
performed
sooner
than
the
others
in
which
you
have
the
full
complement
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
an
English
gentleman
laid
up
at
Auxerre
with
a
broken
arm
,
to
whom
I
sent
my
compliments
,
with
offers
of
service
;
but
his
servant
told
my
man
that
he
did
not
choose
to
see
any
company
,
and
had
no
occasion
for
my
service
.
<EOS>
This
sort
of
reserve
seems
peculiar
to
the
English
disposition
.
<EOS>
When
two
natives
of
any
other
country
chance
to
meet
abroad
,
they
run
into
each
other
's
embrace
like
old
friends
,
even
though
they
have
never
heard
of
one
another
till
that
moment
;
whereas
two
Englishmen
in
the
same
situation
maintain
a
mutual
reserve
and
diffidence
,
and
keep
without
the
sphere
of
each
other
's
attraction
,
like
two
bodies
endowed
with
a
repulsive
power
.
<EOS>
We
only
stopped
to
change
horses
at
Dijon
,
the
capital
of
Burgundy
,
which
is
a
venerable
old
city
;
but
we
passed
part
of
a
day
at
Sens
,
and
visited
a
manufacture
of
that
stuff
we
call
Manchester
velvet
,
which
is
here
made
and
dyed
to
great
perfection
,
under
the
direction
of
English
workmen
,
who
have
been
seduced
from
their
own
country
.
<EOS>
At
Fontainebleau
,
we
went
to
see
the
palace
,
or
as
it
is
called
,
the
castle
,
which
though
an
irregular
pile
of
building
,
affords
a
great
deal
of
lodging
,
and
contains
some
very
noble
apartments
,
particularly
the
hall
of
audience
,
with
the
king
's
and
queen
's
chambers
,
upon
which
the
ornaments
of
carving
and
gilding
are
lavished
with
profusion
rather
than
propriety
.
<EOS>
Here
are
some
rich
parterres
of
flower
-
garden
,
and
a
noble
orangerie
,
which
,
however
,
we
did
not
greatly
admire
,
after
having
lived
among
the
natural
orange
groves
of
Italy
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
we
had
enjoyed
fine
summer
weather
,
and
I
found
myself
so
well
,
that
I
imagined
my
health
was
intirely
restored
:
but
betwixt
Fontainebleau
and
Paris
<EOS>
,
we
were
overtaken
by
a
black
storm
of
rain
,
sleet
,
and
hail
,
which
seemed
to
reinstate
winter
in
all
its
rigour
;
for
the
cold
weather
continues
to
this
day
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
resisting
this
attack
.
<EOS>
I
caught
cold
immediately
;
and
this
was
reinforced
at
Paris
,
where
I
stayed
but
three
days
.
<EOS>
The
same
man
,
(
Pascal
Sellier
,
rue
Guenegaud
,
fauxbourg
St
Germain
)
who
owned
the
coach
that
brought
us
from
Lyons
,
supplied
me
with
a
returned
berline
to
Boulogne
,
for
six
loui'dores
,
and
we
came
hither
by
easy
journeys
.
<EOS>
The
first
night
we
lodged
at
Breteuil
,
where
we
found
an
elegant
inn
,
and
very
good
accommodation
.
<EOS>
But
the
next
we
were
forced
to
take
up
our
quarters
,
at
the
house
where
we
had
formerly
passed
a
very
disagreeable
night
at
Abbeville
.
<EOS>
I
am
now
in
tolerable
lodging
,
where
I
shall
remain
a
few
weeks
,
merely
for
the
sake
of
a
little
repose
;
then
I
shall
gladly
tempt
that
invidious
straight
which
still
divides
you
from
 
Yours
,

c.
