View
From
An
Old
Barrow
<EOS>
On
The
South
DownsFAIRER
spot
than
this
can
not
be
found
amidst
the
whole
range
of
the
South
Downs
—
nor
one
commanding
more
delightful
views
.
<EOS>
Look
at
it
and
judge
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
rounded
summit
of
a
hill
;
or
,
to
speak
with
greater
precision
,
the
mid
-
summit
of
a
series
of
soft
bosomy
eminences
,
springing
from
a
hilly
ridge
,
that
trends
towards
the
coast
,
and
rises
and
falls
smoothly
and
gently
in
its
course
,
like
the
waves
of
a
slightly
agitated
sea
.
<EOS>
The
lovely
mount
is
covered
with
short
elastic
sward
,
redolent
of
thyme
and
other
sweet
-
smelling
herbs
,
and
is
crowned
by
an
ancient
bowl
-
shaped
British
barrow
,
on
the
bank
of
which
we
will
seat
ourselves
,
and
look
around
.
<EOS>
How
pleasing
is
the
prospect
!
<EOS>
how
fresh
the
air
that
visits
us
!
<EOS>
No
breeze
so
fine
and
invigorating
as
that
of
these
Sussex
downs
;
no
turf
so
springy
to
the
foot
as
their
smooth
greensward
.
<EOS>
A
flock
of
larks
flies
past
us
,
and
a
cloud
of
mingled
rooks
and
starlings
wheels
overhead
.
<EOS>
Mark
yon
little
T
-
shaped
cuttings
on
the
slope
below
us
—
those
are
the
snares
set
by
the
shepherds
for
the
delicious
wheatear
—
our
English
ortolan
.
<EOS>
The
fairies
still
haunt
this
spot
,
and
hold
their
midnight
revels
upon
it
,
as
yon
dark
-
green
rings
testify
.
<EOS>
The
common
folk
hereabouts
term
the
good
people
“
Pharisees
,
”
and
style
those
emerald
circles
“
hag
-
tracks
:
”
<EOS>
why
,
we
care
not
to
inquire
.
<EOS>
Enough
for
us
,
the
fairies
are
not
altogether
gone
.
<EOS>
A
smooth
,
soft
carpet
is
here
spread
out
for
Oberon
and
Titania
and
their
attendant
elves
to
dance
upon
by
moonlight
;
and
there
is
no
lack
of
mushrooms
to
form
tables
for
Puck
’s
banquets
.
<EOS>
Own
that
no
hills
can
be
more
beautiful
than
these
South
Downs
.
<EOS>
They
may
want
height
,
boldness
,
grandeur
,
sublimity
;
they
possess
not
forest
,
rock
,
torrent
,
or
ravine
;
but
they
have
gentleness
,
softness
,
and
other
endearing
attributes
.
<EOS>
We
will
not
attempt
to
delineate
the
slight
but
infinite
varieties
of
form
and
aspect
that
distinguish
one
hill
from
its
neighbour
;
for
though
a
strong
family
likeness
marks
them
all
,
each
down
has
an
individual
character
.
<EOS>
Regarded
in
combination
with
each
other
,
the
high
ranges
form
an
exquisite
picture
.
<EOS>
Contemplation
of
such
a
scene
soothes
rather
than
excites
,
and
inspires
only
feelings
of
placid
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
We
are
called
upon
for
no
violent
emotion
.
<EOS>
We
are
not
required
to
admire
Nature
in
her
wildest
and
most
savage
aspect
.
<EOS>
We
have
a
peaceful
landscape
before
us
,
of
a
primitive
character
,
and
possessing
accompaniments
of
pastoral
life
.
<EOS>
Yonder
is
the
shepherd
,
with
crook
and
dog
,
watching
his
flock
browse
on
the
thymy
slopes
—
the
unequalled
sheep
of
the
South
Downs
,
remember
.
<EOS>
At
our
feet
lies
a
well
-
cultivated
valley
,
with
broad
patches
of
turnip
and
mangel
-
wurzel
on
one
side
,
and
a
large
stubble
-
field
on
the
other
,
where
the
ploughman
with
his
yoke
of
patient
oxen
is
at
work
.
<EOS>
In
this
valley
you
may
note
a
farm
-
shed
and
a
sheepfold
,
with
rows
of
haystacks
and
cornstacks
at
various
points
,
evidencing
the
fertility
of
the
soil
.
<EOS>
In
front
of
us
is
the
British
Channel
.
<EOS>
A
burst
of
sunshine
illumines
the
tall
white
cliffs
on
the
east
,
and
gleams
upon
the
far
-
off
lighthouse
.
<EOS>
That
pharos
is
on
Beachy
Head
.
<EOS>
On
the
near
height
overlooking
the
sea
stands
a
windmill
,
while
a
solitary
barn
forms
a
landmark
on
that
distant
hill
.
<EOS>
Altogether
,
a
charming
picture
.
<EOS>
But
we
have
not
yet
fully
examined
it
.
<EOS>
The
beauteous
hill
,
on
the
brow
of
which
we
are
seated
,
has
necessarily
a
valley
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
On
the
right
,
and
immediately
beneath
us
,
is
a
pretty
little
village
,
nestling
amid
a
grove
of
trees
,
above
whose
tops
you
may
discern
the
tower
of
a
small
,
grey
old
church
.
<EOS>
With
this
village
we
trust
to
make
you
more
intimately
acquainted
by
-
and
-
by
.
<EOS>
It
is
Ovingdean
.
<EOS>
On
the
left
,
and
nearer
the
sea
,
you
may
discern
another
,
and
considerably
larger
village
than
Ovingdean
,
almost
as
picturesque
as
the
latter
,
and
possessing
a
grey
,
antique
church
at
its
northern
extremity
.
<EOS>
This
second
village
is
Rottingdean
.
<EOS>
Behind
and
around
on
every
side
,
save
towards
the
sea
,
are
downs
—
downs
with
patches
of
purple
heather
or
grey
gorse
clothing
their
sides
—
downs
with
small
holts
within
their
coombs
,
partially
cultivated
,
or
perfectly
bare
—
everywhere
downs
.
<EOS>
Pleasant
it
is
where
we
sit
to
watch
the
clouds
chase
each
other
across
the
valleys
,
up
the
hill
-
side
,
over
the
hill
-
top
,
then
losing
them
for
a
while
,
behold
them
again
on
a
more
distant
eminence
,
producing
in
their
passage
exquisite
effects
of
light
and
shade
.
<EOS>
Meet
emblem
those
fleeting
clouds
of
our
own
quick
passage
to
eternity
.
<EOS>
Smiling
,
and
sunny
,
and
joy
-
inspiring
are
the
downs
now
;
but
at
times
they
have
a
graver
aspect
.
<EOS>
At
shuddering
dawn
,
or
at
the
midnight
hour
,
they
have
a
solemn
and
mysterious
look
,
and
seem
,
like
the
Sphynx
,
to
mutter
secrets
of
the
Past
.
<EOS>
Of
most
other
places
in
the
land
the
ancient
features
are
changed
,
disfigured
,
or
wholly
obliterated
;
but
the
old
visage
of
the
Sussex
Downs
is
unaltered
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
same
as
when
the
Celtic
Britons
held
their
funeral
ceremonies
on
this
green
mount
;
as
when
the
warlike
Romans
made
their
camps
upon
yonder
neighbouring
hill
;
as
when
our
Saxon
ancestors
dwelt
in
those
secluded
valleys
,
and
gave
names
to
them
which
we
still
retain
.
<EOS>
What
wonder
that
such
ancient
hills
—
ancient
,
but
endowed
with
perpetual
youth
—
should
sometimes
discourse
of
the
great
people
they
have
known
!
<EOS>
What
wonder
when
the
scene
is
the
same
that
the
shades
of
the
mighty
departed
should
sometimes
revisit
the
theatre
of
their
earthly
actions!Before
quitting
our
seat
on
this
old
tumulus
,
let
us
hear
what
delightful
Gilbert
White
has
to
say
about
the
district
:
“
Though
I
have
now
travelled
the
Sussex
Downs
upwards
of
thirty
years
,
”
writes
this
charming
natural
historian
,
“
yet
I
still
investigate
that
chain
of
majestic
mountains
with
fresh
admiration
year
by
year
,
and
think
I
see
new
beauties
every
time
I
traverse
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Ray
was
so
ravished
with
the
prospect
from
Plumpton
Plain
near
Lewes
,
that
he
mentions
those
scenes
in
his
‘
Wisdom
of
God
in
the
works
of
Creation
’
with
the
utmost
satisfaction
,
and
thinks
them
equal
to
anything
he
had
seen
in
the
finest
parts
of
Europe
.
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
think
there
is
something
peculiarly
sweet
and
amusing
in
the
shapely
figured
aspect
of
chalk
hills
in
preference
to
those
of
stone
,
which
are
rugged
,
broken
,
abrupt
,
and
shapeless
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
may
be
singular
in
my
opinion
,
and
not
so
happy
as
to
convey
to
you
the
same
idea
;
but
I
never
contemplate
these
mountains
without
thinking
I
perceive
somewhat
analogous
to
growth
in
their
gentle
swellings
and
smooth
fungus
-
like
protuberances
,
their
fluted
sides
,
and
regular
hollows
and
slopes
,
that
carry
at
once
the
air
of
vegetative
dilatation
and
expansion
.
<EOS>
Or
,
was
there
ever
a
time
when
these
immense
masses
of
calcareous
matter
were
thrown
into
fermentation
by
some
adventitious
moisture
;
were
raised
and
leavened
into
such
shapes
by
some
plastic
power
;
and
so
made
to
swell
and
heave
their
broad
backs
into
the
sky
so
much
above
the
less
animated
clay
of
the
wild
below?”With
all
our
admiration
of
the
amiable
author
of
the
“
Natural
History
of
Selborne
,
”
we
are
not
disposed
to
regard
our
South
Downs
in
the
light
of
vegetable
productions
or
chemical
fermentations
;
but
we
leave
the
solution
of
the
question
to
the
geologist
.
<EOS>
And
now
let
us
descend
to
Ovingdean
,
which
lies
at
our
feet
.

Grange
<EOS>
In
The
Year
Sixteen
Hundred
And
<EOS>
Fifty
-
OneSINCE
the
year
1651
but
<EOS>
slight
change
has
taken
place
in
the
general
aspect
of
the
sequestered
little
village
of
Ovingdean
(
Offingas
den
,
in
Saxon
)
,
situated
in
a
charming
dene
,
or
woody
valley
,
amidst
the
South
Downs
,
and
within
a
mile
of
the
coast
.
<EOS>
During
the
two
centuries
that
have
elapsed
since
the
date
assigned
to
our
story
,
the
habitations
of
this
secluded
little
village
,
which
,
notwithstanding
its
contiguity
to
the
queen
of
watering
-
places
,
Brighton
,
seems
still
quite
out
of
the
world
,
have
scarcely
—
with
one
important
exception
,
namely
,
the
modern
mansion
known
as
Ovingdean
House
—
increased
in
number
,
or
consequence
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
Grange
,
which
,
in
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
,
was
the
principal
residence
of
the
place
,
is
not
only
greatly
reduced
in
size
,
but
has
entirely
lost
its
original
and
distinctive
character
.
<EOS>
Still
,
regarded
without
reference
to
the
past
,
Ovingdean
Grange
,
as
it
now
appears
,
is
a
fair
-
proportioned
,
cheerful
-
looking
domicile
,
and
with
its
white
walls
and
pleasant
garden
,
full
of
arbutuses
,
laurestines
,
holms
,
and
roses
,
offers
a
very
favourable
specimen
of
a
Sussex
farm
-
house
.
<EOS>
In
one
respect
,
and
that
by
no
means
an
immaterial
one
,
the
existing
Grange
far
surpasses
its
predecessor
;
namely
,
in
the
magnitude
and
convenient
arrangements
of
its
farmyard
,
as
well
as
in
the
number
of
its
barns
,
cow
-
houses
,
and
other
outbuildings
,
all
of
which
are
upon
a
scale
never
dreamed
of
in
the
olden
time
.
<EOS>
But
as
it
is
with
the
ancient
house
that
we
have
now
to
do
,
we
must
endeavour
to
give
some
notion
of
it
.
<EOS>
Even
in
1651
,
Ovingdean
Grange
was
old
,
having
been
built
in
the
reign
of
Henry
VIII
.
<EOS>
Constructed
of
red
brick
,
chequered
with
diamonds
,
formed
of
other
bricks
,
glazed
,
and
of
darker
hue
,
mingled
with
flints
,
it
seemed
destined
to
endure
for
ages
,
and
presented
a
very
striking
frontage
,
owing
to
the
bold
projections
of
its
bay
-
windows
with
their
stone
posts
and
lintels
,
its
deep
arched
portal
with
a
stone
escutcheon
above
it
,
emblazoned
with
the
arms
of
the
Maunsels
,
at
that
time
its
possessors
,
its
stone
quoins
and
cornices
,
its
carved
gables
,
its
high
roof
,
covered
with
tiles
entrusted
with
orange
-
tawny
mosses
and
lichens
,
and
its
triple
clusters
of
tall
and
ornamented
chimney
-
shafts
.
<EOS>
Old
Ovingdean
Grange
did
not
want
a
rookery
.
<EOS>
In
a
fine
grove
of
elms
,
occupying
part
of
the
valley
towards
the
south
,
a
large
colony
of
these
aristocratic
birds
had
taken
up
their
quarters
.
<EOS>
Nor
must
we
omit
to
mention
that
many
of
the
trees
,
in
the
upper
branches
of
which
the
rooks
’
nests
might
be
seen
,
had
attained
a
girth
and
altitude
not
a
little
remarkable
,
considering
their
proximity
to
the
sea
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
already
intimated
that
the
ancient
farm-
yard
was
neither
so
extensive
nor
so
well
arranged
as
its
successor
,
but
it
possessed
one
of
those
famous
old
circular
dovecots
,
which
used
to
be
the
pride
of
a
Sussex
country
-
house
,
and
which
,
before
pigeon
-
matches
were
introduced
,
never
failed
to
supply
the
family
table
with
a
savoury
pie
or
a
roast
.
<EOS>
At
the
rear
of
the
house
was
a
garden
,
walled
round
,
and
laid
out
in
the
old
-
fashioned
style
,
with
parterres
and
terraces
;
and
beyond
it
was
an
orchard
full
of
fruit-
trees
.
<EOS>
Higher
up
on
the
down
was
a
straggling
little
holt
,
or
thicket
,
the
trees
of
which
,
by
their
stunted
growth
and
distorted
shapes
,
manifested
the
influence
of
the
sea
-
breezes
.
<EOS>
When
we
have
mentioned
a
large
close
,
encompassed
by
a
shaw
,
or
fence
of
low
trees
,
and
displaying
within
its
area
a
few
venerable
hawthorns
,
ancient
denizens
of
the
downs
<EOS>
,
we
shall
have
particularized
all
the
domains
of
old
Ovingdean
Grange
.
<EOS>
The
little
village
of
Ovingdean
,
consisted
then
,
as
now
,
of
a
few
neatly
-
kept
cottages
,
clustered
like
beehives
near
the
mansion
,
some
three
or
four
in
the
valley
,
but
the
most
part
amongst
the
trees
on
the
side
of
the
eastern
down
.
<EOS>
These
cottages
were
tenanted
by
the
bailiff
,
the
husbandmen
,
shepherds
,
and
other
hinds
employed
at
the
Grange
.
<EOS>
But
the
most
pleasing
feature
of
the
place
,
and
one
by
which
it
is
happily
yet
distinguished
,
was
the
church
.
<EOS>
Scarce
a
stone
<EOS>
’s
throw
from
the
Grange
,
at
the
foot
of
a
wooded
escarpment
,
on
the
western
side
of
the
dene
,
and
on
a
green
and
gentle
declivity
,
stood
,
and
still
stands
,
the
reverend
little
pile
.
<EOS>
Grey
and
old
was
Ovingdean
church
at
the
time
of
our
story
,
for
its
architecture
is
Norman
and
Early
English
,
but
it
is
upwards
of
two
centuries
older
now
,
and
somewhat
greyer
in
consequence
,
though
Time
has
dealt
kindly
with
it
,
and
has
touched
it
with
a
hand
so
loving
and
tender
,
that
if
he
has
robbed
it
of
aught
,
he
has
only
added
to
its
beauty
.
<EOS>
Peace
rests
upon
the
antique
little
fane
,
and
breathes
from
out
its
hoary
walls
.
<EOS>
Peace
rests
upon
the
grassy
mounds
and
carefully
-
tended
tombs
lying
within
its
quiet
precincts
.
<EOS>
Nothing
more
hushed
,
more
sequestered
,
more
winningly
and
unobtrusively
beautiful
,
can
be
conceived
than
this
simple
village
churchyard
.
<EOS>
The
grey
old
walls
that
surround
it
,
and
shut
it
in
like
a
garden
,
the
trees
that
shade
it
,
and
completely
shelter
the
holy
edifice
on
the
north
,
give
it
a
peculiar
air
of
privacy
and
tranquillity
.
<EOS>
Subdued
by
the
calming
influences
of
the
spot
,
the
heart
becomes
melted
,
the
thoughts
soar
heavenward
.
<EOS>
Truly
,
a
quiet
resting
-
place
after
the
turmoil
of
life
.
<EOS>
Nor
will
the
devotional
feelings
inspired
by
a
pause
within
these
hallowed
precincts
be
lessened
by
an
entrance
into
the
sacred
edifice
itself
;
for
there
,
if
you
love
simplicity
,
you
shall
find
it
;
there
you
shall
behold
a
primitive
little
village
church
,
without
ornament
,
yet
possessing
the
richest
ornament
in
the
absence
of
all
decorative
artifice
;
lacking
not
the
graces
of
ecclesiastical
architecture
as
displayed
in
the
rounded
arches
dividing
its
nave
from
the
chancel
,
and
elsewhere
in
the
structure
;
there
,
nothing
shall
disturb
your
religious
train
of
thought
;
there
,
you
shall
find
a
rustic
congregation
,
and
shall
listen
to
rustic
voices
chanting
the
holy
hymn
;
and
above
all
,
you
shall
hear
<EOS>
our
Church
’s
noble
service
well
and
worthily
performed
,
and
shall
have
good
ghostly
council
from
a
good
man
’s
lips
.
<EOS>
Though
sufficing
for
the
thinly
-
peopled
parish
in
which
it
stands
,
the
dimensions
of
Ovingdean
church
are
modest
enough
,
the
nave
and
chancel
,
taken
together
,
being
little
larger
than
those
of
many
a
private
chapel
.
<EOS>
Aisles
<EOS>
it
has
none
,
though
it
may
once
have
possessed
a
south
wing
,
marks
of
an
arch
being
still
discernible
on
the
external
wall
on
this
side
of
the
edifice
;
the
roof
is
open
,
and
crossed
and
supported
by
stout
beams
of
oak
;
and
the
low
square
western
tower
,
entered
from
within
,
serves
the
joint
purposes
of
vestiary
and
belfry
.
<EOS>
We
should
prefer
the
true
colour
of
the
stone
and
timber
to
whitewash
,
but
the
latter
,
at
all
events
,
is
clean
and
cheerful
to
look
upon
,
and
serves
to
display
the
many
hatchments
and
marble
tablets
reared
against
the
walls
.
<EOS>
Over
the
screen
separating
the
nave
from
the
chancel
may
be
read
these
comforting
words
:
“
Come
unto
me
all
ye
that
labour
and
are
heavy
laden
,
and
I
will
give
you
rest
.
”
<EOS>
Together
with
this
verse
from
the
Psalms
,
well
suited
to
the
place
:
“
This
shall
be
my
rest
forever
<EOS>
:
here
will
I
dwell
,
for
I
have
a
delight
therein
.
<EOS>
”But
<EOS>
though
we
love
the
old
pile
,
we
must
not
linger
within
it
too
long
,
but
go
forth
into
its
quiet
churchyard
,
now
basking
in
sunshine
,
and
visited
by
the
sweet
and
delicate
air
of
the
downs
.
<EOS>
If
there
be
a
gleam
of
sunshine
in
the
skies
,
it
seems
to
seek
out
this
favoured
spot
;
while
,
when
the
rain
descends
here
,
it
falls
gently
as
the
tears
of
a
mourner
.
<EOS>
Would
you
see
,
ere
we
pass
out
by
the
arched
gateway
leading
to
the
rectory
,
two
relics
of
two
centuries
ago
?
<EOS>
you
may
perceive
them
in
yon
pair
of
decayed
elder
-
trees
,
whose
hoar
,
gnarled
,
corrugated
trunks
,
and
fantastically
twisted
branches
,
flung
out
like
huge
antlers
,
have
but
little
vitality
about
them
,
and
yet
are
deservedly
spared
for
their
age
and
picturesque
appearance
.
<EOS>
Where
the
present
cheerful
and
commodious
parsonage
-
house
now
stands
,
stood
,
in
earlier
days
,
a
small
monastic
-
looking
structure
,
of
higher
antiquity
even
than
the
Grange
;
and
this
time
-
honoured
edifice
,
all
traces
of
which
,
except
some
portions
of
its
garden
walls
,
have
disappeared
,
had
served
as
an
abiding-
place
for
many
successive
pastors
of
the
neighbouring
church
.
<EOS>
But
alas
!
<EOS>
in
the
unhappy
and
distracted
times
of
which
we
propose
to
treat
,
this
little
manse
sheltered
no
minister
of
our
Church
.
<EOS>
A
woful
change
had
come
over
it
.
<EOS>
The
good
pastor
,
who
for
years
had
dwelt
there
,
honoured
and
beloved
by
all
who
profited
by
his
teaching
;
who
was
pious
,
charitable
,
tolerant
,
and
irreproachable
in
conduct
;
<EOS>
this
excellent
man
,
with
whom
no
fault
could
be
found
,
save
that
he
was
a
firm
and
consistent
supporter
of
the
established
Church
of
England
,
and
a
resolute
maintainer
of
its
tenets
and
of
episcopal
jurisdiction
,
was
deprived
of
his
benefice
,
driven
from
his
dwelling
,
and
no
longer
permitted
to
exercise
his
sacred
functions
within
those
walls
where
his
voice
had
so
often
been
heard
.
<EOS>
The
Reverend
Ardingly
Beard
,
for
so
was
named
this
sufferer
in
a
good
cause
,
bore
his
own
crosses
without
a
murmur
,
but
he
ceased
not
to
deplore
the
fallen
state
of
the
Church
,
now
become
a
prey
to
ravening
wolves
.
<EOS>
When
condemned
as
an
obstinate
and
incurable
prelatist
and
malignant
,
and
dispossessed
of
his
church
and
living
,
he
had
the
additional
grief
and
mortification
of
finding
his
place
occupied
by
the
Reverend
Master
Increase
Micklegift
(
as
the
latter
chose
to
style
himself
,
though
his
real
name
was
Zaccheus
Stonegall
)
,
an
Independent
minister
,
and
a
zealous
expounder
of
his
own
doctrines
,
but
whom
Mr.
Beard
regarded
as
a
hypocrite
,
and
highly
dangerous
to
the
spiritual
welfare
of
his
somewhile
flock
.
<EOS>
But
the
deprived
clergyman
did
not
retire
altogether
from
the
scene
of
his
labours
,
though
prevented
from
continuing
them
as
heretofore
.
<EOS>
He
obtained
an
asylum
at
the
Grange
,
with
its
owner
and
his
assured
and
sympathizing
friend
,
the
Royalist
Colonel
Wolston
Maunsel
.
<EOS>
For
many
years
a
widower
,
the
good
pastor
had
found
solace
in
the
companionship
and
affectionate
attentions
of
the
only
child
left
him
,
his
daughter
Dulcia
.
<EOS>
At
the
time
of
his
suspension
from
his
religious
functions
,
which
unhappy
event
occurred
about
four
years
before
the
date
of
our
story
.
<EOS>
Dulcia
Beard
had
just
reached
her
fifteenth
spring
,
and
though
she
felt
the
blow
at
the
moment
with
as
much
acuteness
as
her
father
,
yet
with
the
happy
elasticity
of
youth
she
speedily
shook
off
its
effects
,
and
regained
her
wonted
buoyancy
of
spirit
.
<EOS>
In
sooth
,
there
was
not
much
to
make
her
regret
the
change
of
abode
.
<EOS>
Apartments
were
assigned
to
her
father
and
herself
at
the
Grange
,
where
they
might
dwell
as
retired
as
they
pleased
,
and
in
order
to
remove
any
sense
of
dependence
on
the
part
of
his
reverend
guest
,
Colonel
Maunsel
appointed
him
to
the
office
of
his
domestic
chaplain
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
though
forbidden
,
under
the
penalty
of
fine
and
imprisonment
,
to
preach
to
his
somewhile
flock
in
public
,
or
even
to
perform
the
church
-
service
covertly
,
our
good
clergyman
was
enabled
to
address
in
private
such
as
were
not
backsliders
or
apostates
,
and
prevent
them
from
wavering
in
the
true
faith
.
<EOS>
Greatly
beholden
,
therefore
,
did
the
worthy
man
feel
to
him
who
,
under
Providence
,
afforded
an
asylum
fraught
with
so
many
advantages
to
himself
and
his
dearly
beloved
child
.
<EOS>
In
all
respects
Dulcia
Beard
merited
her
father
’s
love
.
<EOS>
A
gentler
,
sweeter
disposition
than
hers
could
not
be
found
;
purer
and
higher
principles
than
she
possessed
never
existed
in
female
bosom
.
<EOS>
As
she
grew
towards
womanhood
her
personal
charms
became
more
fully
developed
.
<EOS>
Soft
and
delicate
in
mould
,
her
features
expressed
in
every
line
the
amiability
and
goodness
of
her
nature
.
<EOS>
Impossible
to
doubt
the
candour
of
her
clear
,
blue
,
earnest
eyes
.
<EOS>
Equally
impossible
to
misunderstand
the
serenity
of
her
marble
brow
,
or
the
composure
of
her
classic
countenance
.
<EOS>
Calm
was
her
countenance
,
but
not
cold
;
classic
were
her
features
in
form
,
but
with
nothing
rigorous
in
their
outline
.
<EOS>
If
her
features
corresponded
with
her
nature
,
so
did
her
person
correspond
with
her
features
.
<EOS>
Graceful
in
the
highest
degree
,
her
figure
was
tall
,
and
of
exquisite
symmetry
.
<EOS>
Her
manner
was
entirely
unsophisticated
,
and
captivating
from
its
very
simplicity
.
<EOS>
The
very
reverse
of
a
modish
gentlewoman
was
Dulcia
Beard
,
and
owed
none
of
her
attractions
to
art
.
<EOS>
Whether
any
other
image
beside
that
of
her
father
had
found
a
place
within
that
gentle
bosom
,
will
be
seen
as
we
proceed
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Wolston
Maunsel
of
Ovingdean
Grange
has
been
described
as
a
Royalist
,
but
his
description
of
himself
,
“
that
he
was
a
Cavalier
to
the
backbone
,
”
would
be
more
correct
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Maunsel
hated
the
rebels
and
Roundheads
and
the
whole
Republican
party
,
civil
,
military
,
and
religious
,
as
he
hated
poison
;
but
if
he
had
a
special
object
of
aversion
it
was
Noll
Cromwell
.
<EOS>
The
execution
of
Charles
deepened
the
colonel
’s
animosity
towards
the
regicides
,
and
after
the
direful
tragedy
of
Whitehall
,
he
assumed
a
mourning
habit
,
vowing
never
to
put
it
off
till
the
death
of
the
martyred
monarch
should
be
fully
avenged
upon
his
murderers
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Maunsel
was
descended
from
a
good
old
Sussex
family
;
the
branch
he
belonged
to
having
settled
at
Ovingdean
.
<EOS>
Though
not
brought
up
to
the
profession
of
arms
,
but
rather
from
habit
and
position
disposed
to
lead
the
life
of
a
country
squire
,
our
loyal
gentleman
,
on
the
outbreak
of
the
Civil
War
,
alarmed
by
the
imminence
of
the
crisis
,
and
instigated
by
his
own
strong
Cavalier
feelings
,
had
deemed
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
abandon
a
home
he
delighted
in
,
together
with
a
wife
whom
he
passionately
loved
,
and
joined
the
standard
of
the
king
.
<EOS>
For
several
years
Wolston
Maunsel
served
under
Prince
Rupert
,
and
shared
in
the
victories
as
well
as
in
the
defeats
of
that
great
,
though
somewhat
rash
,
commander
.
<EOS>
He
fought
at
the
famous
battle
of
Edgehill
,
where
Rupert
’s
matchless
cavalry
did
such
signal
execution
upon
the
Parliamentarians
,
at
Lansdown
Hill
,
and
at
Chalgrove
Field
;
was
present
at
the
sieges
of
Bristol
and
Bolton
,
at
the
important
but
ill
-
starred
battle
of
Marston
Moor
,
and
at
Ledbury
,
after
which
engagement
he
obtained
from
the
Prince
the
command
of
a
regiment
of
dragoons
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Maunsel
’s
last
appearance
on
the
battle
-
field
was
at
Naseby
,
where
his
regiment
was
completely
cut
to
pieces
by
Fairfax
,
and
he
himself
severely
wounded
and
made
prisoner
.
<EOS>
With
other
captives
he
was
sent
by
the
victorious
Parliamentary
leaders
to
the
castle
of
Chester
,
and
detained
long
enough
there
to
shatter
his
health
.
<EOS>
Heavy
fines
were
inflicted
upon
him
,
which
greatly
impoverished
his
estates
,
but
after
nearly
a
year
’s
confinement
he
was
released
,
and
retired
to
his
residence
at
Ovingdean
,
where
we
have
found
him
.
<EOS>
But
other
calamities
,
besides
defeat
and
loss
of
property
,
had
befallen
the
unfortunate
Cavalier
.
<EOS>
During
the
time
of
his
immurement
within
Chester
Castle
,
his
beloved
wife
,
who
was
not
permitted
to
share
her
husband
’s
captivity
,
had
died
from
grief
and
anxiety
.
<EOS>
An
only
son
,
then
just
sixteen
,
was
,
however
,
left
him
.
<EOS>
Had
the
Civil
War
continued
,
this
high
-
spirited
youth
,
who
inherited
all
his
father
’s
principles
of
loyalty
,
and
hated
the
Republicans
as
heartily
as
his
father
,
would
have
followed
in
the
old
Cavalier
’s
footsteps
;
but
when
Colonel
Maunsel
was
set
free
,
the
struggle
was
well
-
nigh
over
,
the
Royalist
party
was
crushed
for
the
time
,
and
did
not
rally
again
for
nearly
five
years
,
when
Charles
the
Second
was
crowned
at
Scone
,
and
entered
England
at
the
head
of
a
small
army
,
with
the
futile
hope
,
as
it
proved
,
of
conquering
his
rebellious
kingdom
.
<EOS>
Then
it
was
that
Clavering
Maunsel
,
who
by
this
time
had
become
a
remarkably
handsome
young
man
of
one
-
and
-
twenty
,
and
was
as
eager
for
the
fray
as
a
war-
horse
stirred
by
the
trumpet
,
was
despatched
by
the
colonel
to
aid
the
youthful
monarch
.
<EOS>
If
his
father
had
tried
to
restrain
the
young
Cavalier
,
the
attempt
would
have
been
ineffectual
;
but
the
loyal
old
colonel
did
no
such
thing
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
he
commanded
him
to
go
;
gave
him
his
own
sword
,
and
bade
him
use
it
against
the
enemies
of
the
king
,
and
the
slayers
of
the
king
’s
father
.
<EOS>
While
straining
his
son
to
his
breast
at
parting
,
the
gallant
old
Cavalier
declared
that
he
envied
him
,
his
sole
grief
being
that
he
could
not
accompany
him
.
<EOS>
“
But
of
what
use
to
his
Majesty
would
be
a
battered
old
soldier
like
myself
,
who
can
scarce
move
limb
without
help
?
”
<EOS>
he
cried
.
<EOS>
“
So
go
,
my
son
,
and
fight
for
me
in
the
righteous
cause
.
<EOS>
Strike
down
those
accursed
traitors
and
parricides
—
slay
them
,
and
spare
not
.
<EOS>
”With
<EOS>
his
son
,
Colonel
Maunsel
sent
a
veteran
follower
,
to
whose
care
he
knew
the
young
man
could
be
safely
confided
;
and
the
measure
was
very
judicious
,
as
the
event
proved
.
<EOS>
The
faithful
attendant
to
whom
Clavering
Maunsel
was
entrusted
was
an
ancient
trooper
in
the
king
’s
service
,
named
John
Habergeon
,
who
had
fought
with
the
colonel
in
many
a
rude
engagement
with
the
rebels
,
and
had
bled
with
him
at
Naseby
.
<EOS>
Though
numbering
more
years
than
his
old
master
,
John
Habergeon
’s
strength
was
by
no
means
on
the
decline
.
<EOS>
Hoary
was
he
as
an
Alp
;
his
gigantic
frame
was
as
hard
as
iron
;
and
few
younger
men
could
cope
with
him
in
personal
encounter
.
<EOS>
John
Habergeon
’s
exterior
was
by
no
means
prepossessing
.
<EOS>
His
features
were
harsh
,
and
his
manner
crabbed
and
stern
.
<EOS>
His
figure
was
gaunt
and
tall
;
and
he
stood
so
stiff
and
erect
that
he
lost
not
an
inch
of
his
stature
.
<EOS>
Yet
under
his
rugged
exterior
there
beat
a
heart
tender
as
a
woman
’s
;
and
follower
more
faithful
and
devoted
could
not
be
found
than
trusty
John
Habergeon
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
without
some
difficulty
and
danger
that
Clavering
and
his
companion
managed
to
reach
Worcester
,
in
which
loyal
city
the
adventurous
young
king
had
established
his
head
-
quarters
.
<EOS>
Though
the
new
comer
brought
him
no
important
levy
of
horse
or
foot
,
but
only
a
single
follower
,
Charles
received
the
young
man
with
great
satisfaction
,
and
well
aware
of
his
father
’s
high
character
,
misfortunes
,
and
fidelity
to
the
royal
cause
,
at
once
bestowed
upon
him
the
command
of
a
troop
of
horse
under
Colonel
Wogan
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
our
purpose
to
describe
the
events
preceding
the
disastrous
day
of
Worcester
,
nor
to
furnish
any
details
of
that
fatal
engagement
,
when
the
hopes
of
the
young
monarch
and
his
adherents
were
utterly
destroyed
.
<EOS>
Having
as
little
sympathy
as
the
Cavaliers
themselves
with
the
Republican
army
and
its
victorious
general
,
it
is
no
pleasure
to
us
to
record
their
successes
.
<EOS>
Suffice
it
then
to
say
,
that
while
preparations
were
making
by
Charles
and
his
generals
for
the
coming
conflict
,
Clavering
exhibited
the
utmost
ardour
and
impatience
;
and
when
at
length
the
luckless
3rd
of
September
arrived
,
proved
himself
by
his
fiery
courage
,
and
perhaps
by
his
rashness
,
to
be
his
father
’s
son
.
<EOS>
Some
intelligence
of
his
brave
doings
during
the
battle
had
been
received
at
Ovingdean
Grange
,
but
what
became
of
him
afterwards
was
not
known
.
<EOS>
His
name
did
not
appear
amongst
the
list
of
the
slain
;
but
such
lists
in
those
troublous
times
were
ever
imperfect
.
<EOS>
Wogan
’s
regiment
,
it
was
known
,
had
suffered
severely
in
covering
the
king
’s
retreat
;
and
what
so
probable
as
that
foolhardy
and
inexperienced
Clavering
had
fallen
then
.
<EOS>
So
at
least
feared
his
father
.
<EOS>
So
feared
another
,
whose
gentle
heart
was
distracted
by
doubt
and
anxiety
.
<EOS>
Sad
presentiments
had
filled
Dulcia
’s
breast
when
young
Maunsel
,
full
of
martial
ardour
and
enthusiasm
for
his
cause
,
had
set
out
on
the
expedition
.
<EOS>
She
had
accompanied
him
to
the
summit
of
the
down
overlooking
the
neighbouring
town
of
Brightelmstone
,
then
giving
little
promise
of
its
future
magnitude
and
importance
,
and
chiefly
noticeable
from
this
point
by
a
cluster
of
quaint
old
houses
,
with
red
-
tiled
roofs
and
gables
,
grouped
around
the
ancient
church
on
the
hill
,
together
with
a
short
scattered
street
,
consisting
mostly
of
cottages
and
mean
habitations
,
running
towards
the
sea:—she
had
accompanied
him
,
we
say
,
to
this
point
,
and
after
a
tearful
parting
—
tearful
on
her
side
,
at
least
—
had
gazed
wistfully
after
him
till
he
gained
the
brow
of
the
opposite
hill
,
when
he
waved
a
farewell
with
the
scarf
she
had
embroidered
for
him
,
and
disappeared
from
view
.
<EOS>
Had
he
disappeared
for
ever
?
<EOS>
was
the
question
that
occupied
Dulcia
,
as
she
returned
to
the
Grange
with
her
attendant
,
Patty
Whinchat
.
<EOS>
Very
beautiful
and
very
picturesque
did
the
old
house
appear
,
embosomed
amidst
its
trees
,
and
with
the
old
church
adjoining
,
as
viewed
from
the
high
ground
she
was
traversing
,
but
she
looked
not
towards
it
,
for
her
thoughts
were
wandering
in
another
direction
.
<EOS>
Patty
,
a
lively
little
damsel
,
and
disposed
to
take
a
cheerful
view
of
things
,
chattered
away
,
and
assured
her
mistress
that
Master
Clavering
would
soon
be
back
again
,
after
killing
all
the
Roundheads
;
but
after
a
while
,
receiving
neither
response
nor
other
encouragement
to
talk
,
she
became
silent
,
and
tried
to
shed
a
few
tears
for
company
.
<EOS>
Often
did
Dulcia
recur
to
this
parting
with
Clavering
,
and
never
without
reviving
the
sad
forebodings
which
she
had
then
experienced
.
<EOS>
These
,
however
,
were
vague
fears
,
and
easily
shaken
off
.
<EOS>
But
when
she
heard
of
Worcester
’s
disastrous
fight
—
when
rumours
of
dreadful
slaughter
of
the
Royalists
reached
her
—
when
day
after
day
passed
,
and
no
tidings
came
of
Clavering
<EOS>
—
we
may
imagine
how
much
she
suffered
.
<EOS>
She
dreaded
to
receive
confirmation
of
her
worst
fears
,
and
yet
this
suspense
was
well
-
nigh
intolerable
.
<EOS>
By
day
a
pallid
image
with
stony
eyes
was
ever
before
her
;
and
at
night
she
beheld
the
same
figure
in
her
dreams
,
stretched
like
a
blood
-
stained
corpse
upon
the
battle
-
plain
.
<EOS>
As
to
Colonel
Maunsel
,
though
anxiety
as
to
his
son
’s
fate
was
naturally
uppermost
in
his
bosom
,
the
consideration
of
what
he
deemed
to
be
a
great
national
calamity
weighed
so
heavily
upon
him
,
as
in
some
degree
to
absorb
his
private
griefs
.
<EOS>
The
issue
of
the
battle
of
Worcester
he
deemed
fatal
to
his
country
.
<EOS>
England
was
dishonoured
;
its
glory
obscured
.
<EOS>
Right
,
religion
,
loyalty
,
were
trampled
under
foot
.
<EOS>
Republicanism
was
clearly
in
the
ascendant
:
the
star
of
monarchy
,
which
had
shone
for
a
moment
with
its
accustomed
splendour
,
had
set
,
he
feared
,
for
ever
.
<EOS>
While
deploring
the
prostrate
condition
of
his
own
party
,
now
at
the
mercy
of
its
hated
opponents
,
he
felt
yet
more
acutely
the
terrible
jeopardy
in
which
the
head
of
that
party
was
placed
.
<EOS>
What
had
become
of
Charles
,
after
the
conflict
on
which
he
had
staked
his
fortunes
,
the
colonel
could
only
conjecture
.
<EOS>
But
he
felt
certain
that
the
royal
fugitive
had
as
yet
contrived
to
elude
the
vigilance
of
his
enemies
.
<EOS>
Charles
’s
capture
would
have
been
too
loudly
proclaimed
not
to
be
quickly
known
throughout
the
realm
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
almost
equally
certain
that
the
young
king
was
yet
within
the
country
,
and
his
retreat
might
,
therefore
,
at
any
moment
be
discovered
.
<EOS>
A
large
reward
was
offered
for
his
capture
;
and
the
penalties
of
high
treason
,
loss
of
life
and
forfeiture
of
estate
,
were
adjudged
to
such
as
should
harbour
him
,
or
aid
in
his
escape
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Maunsell
was
well
aware
,
from
his
own
feelings
,
that
no
personal
risk
would
prevent
any
loyal
subject
from
assisting
his
sovereign
;
but
he
naturally
dreaded
lest
the
reward
offered
by
the
council
of
state
might
tempt
some
sordid
knave
to
cause
Charles
’s
betrayal
.
<EOS>
All
these
considerations
sorely
perplexed
and
grieved
the
old
Cavalier
’s
spirit
.
<EOS>
The
burden
of
his
anxiety
was
almost
greater
than
he
could
bear
,
and
threatened
to
bow
him
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
He
began
to
fear
that
the
messenger
who
brought
him
word
that
his
son
had
been
found
amongst
the
slain
,
would
tell
him
that
the
king
had
been
captured
.
<EOS>
Such
tidings
,
doubly
calamitous
<EOS>
,
he
was
well
assured
,
would
prove
his
own
death
-
blow
.

CHAPTER
IIIShowing
What
Befel
Clavering
MaunselAfter
<EOS>
The
Battle
Of
WorcesterA
WEEK
had
elapsed
since
the
calamitous
day
at
Worcester
—
a
week
,
as
we
have
shown
,
of
frightful
anxiety
and
suspense
to
the
principal
inmates
of
Ovingdean
Grange
—
but
still
no
tidings
came
of
Clavering
Maunsel
,
or
of
his
faithful
follower
,
John
Habergeon
.
<EOS>
Neither
had
news
,
good
or
bad
,
been
received
relative
to
the
fugitive
king
.
<EOS>
Somewhat
late
at
night
,
the
old
colonel
was
sitting
with
Mr.
Beard
and
Dulcia
in
the
great
hall
of
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
Supper
had
been
discussed
,
though
a
couple
of
long
-
necked
flasks
with
tall
glasses
were
still
left
upon
the
huge
oak
table
;
prayers
had
been
read
by
the
good
clergyman
;
and
the
little
party
were
conversing
sadly
together
before
their
separation
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Maunsel
ordinarily
retired
at
an
earlier
hour
than
this
,
but
he
cared
not
now
to
seek
his
chamber
,
since
he
found
no
rest
within
it
.
<EOS>
The
hall
in
which
we
discovered
the
little
party
was
spacious
and
lofty
,
with
a
moulded
ceiling
,
panels
of
dark
oak
,
a
high
carved
mantelpiece
,
deep
bay-
windows
,
having
stained
glass
within
them
,
and
an
elaborately
carved
doorway
corresponding
with
the
mantelpiece
,
and
opening
upon
a
corridor
.
<EOS>
Several
old
family
portraits
,
male
and
female
,
in
the
costume
of
James
the
First
’s
time
,
and
in
that
of
Elizabeth
,
adorned
the
walls
.
<EOS>
Mingled
with
these
portraits
were
trophies
formed
by
pieces
of
old
armour
,
coats
of
mail
and
shirts
of
mail
,
skull
-
caps
,
bucklers
,
and
chanfrons
,
surrounded
by
two
-
handed
swords
,
battle-
axes
,
maces
,
cross
-
bows
and
long
bows
;
while
a
buck
’s
head
with
enormous
antlers
occupied
a
conspicuous
position
opposite
the
fireplace
.
<EOS>
The
night
being
chilly
,
a
comfortable
wood
fire
blazed
upon
the
dogs
on
the
hearth
,
and
diffused
a
cheerful
light
around
.
<EOS>
A
few
high
-
backed
arm
-
chairs
of
richly
carved
oak
,
cushioned
with
crimson
Utrecht
velvet
,
together
with
an
open
cupboard
,
on
the
shelves
of
which
were
displayed
several
capacious
flagons
,
parcel
-
gilt
goblets
,
and
other
drinking
vessels
in
glass
and
silver
,
with
a
massive
salver
,
gilt
like
the
goblets
,
in
the
midst
of
them
,
constituted
the
furniture
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
There
was
one
portrait
,
hung
apart
from
the
others
,
that
claims
special
attention
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
full
-
length
picture
,
by
no
less
a
painter
than
Vandyke
,
of
a
young
and
lovely
woman
,
attired
in
a
robe
of
rich
white
satin
,
made
very
low
in
front
,
so
as
to
display
a
neck
of
ravishing
beauty
,
and
far
whiter
than
the
satin
<EOS>
,
pearl
ornaments
upon
the
stomacher
,
a
pearl
necklace
around
the
throat
,
pearl
earrings
,
and
bracelets
of
the
same
gems
on
the
arms
.
<EOS>
The
features
of
this
charming
personage
had
a
somewhat
pensive
expression
that
by
no
means
detracted
from
their
loveliness
;
the
eyes
were
magnificent
,
and
black
as
night
;
the
hair
of
raven
hue
,
contrasting
forcibly
with
the
dazzling
whiteness
of
the
skin
.
<EOS>
The
dark
locks
were
taken
back
from
the
centre
of
the
forehead
,
and
disposed
in
thick
ringlets
at
the
sides
of
the
face
,
their
sole
ornament
being
a
spray
of
green
leaves
placed
on
the
left
of
the
head
.
<EOS>
This
portrait
,
which
bore
the
date
1630
,
represented
Lady
Clemence
Maunsel
,
the
colonel
’s
wife
,
and
when
gazing
at
her
bewitching
lineaments
,
no
one
could
wonder
that
he
had
passionately
loved
her
,
or
that
he
ceased
not
to
deplore
her
loss
.
<EOS>
At
the
time
that
his
wife
’s
portrait
was
painted
,
Wolston
Maunsel
was
scarcely
her
inferior
in
point
of
personal
appearance
,
and
they
were
noted
as
the
handsomest
couple
in
Sussex
.
<EOS>
Long
years
and
much
suffering
,
both
of
mind
and
body
,
had
done
their
work
with
him
,
but
he
had
still
a
very
noble
and
striking
countenance
.
<EOS>
His
locks
were
grizzled
,
and
flowed
over
his
neck
and
shoulders
in
Cavalier
fashion
;
his
beard
was
pointed
in
the
style
familiarized
to
us
by
Vandyke
.
<EOS>
His
figure
was
tall
and
spare
,
but
his
wounds
and
after
sufferings
had
stiffened
his
limbs
,
afflicting
him
with
rheumatic
pains
,
which
caused
him
to
move
with
difficulty
,
and
prevented
all
active
exertion
.
<EOS>
His
features
were
finely
formed
,
but
very
thin
,
his
complexion
dark
,
and
his
black
overhanging
eyebrows
and
keen
grey
eyes
gave
him
a
stern
and
austere
expression
.
<EOS>
His
habiliments
,
we
have
said
,
were
sable
;
his
black
taffeta
doublet
and
vest
were
of
the
graceful
fashion
of
Charles
the
First
’s
time
;
his
trunk
hose
had
knots
of
ribbons
at
the
knees
;
black
silk
hose
encased
his
still
shapely
legs
;
and
his
shoes
were
of
Spanish
leather
,
high
-
heeled
,
and
with
black
roses
on
the
instep
.
<EOS>
A
wide
falling
band
of
lawn
,
edged
with
lace
,
set
off
the
old
Cavalier
’s
handsome
physiognomy
.
<EOS>
A
venerable
-
looking
man
was
the
Reverend
Ardingly
Beard
,
with
a
bald
head
and
the
snowy
honours
of
age
upon
his
chin
,
for
the
clergy
of
those
days
wore
the
beard
.
<EOS>
Bitter
had
been
his
cup
,
but
it
had
not
soured
his
heart
,
as
was
plain
from
his
benevolence
of
expression
and
kindliness
of
manner
.
<EOS>
Resignation
to
the
will
of
Heaven
was
the
governing
rule
of
the
good
man
’s
life
,
and
the
influence
of
this
principle
was
apparent
not
only
in
his
conduct
,
but
in
his
aspect
and
demeanour
.
<EOS>
Patience
and
humility
were
written
in
legible
characters
in
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
Prohibited
by
the
enactments
in
force
against
the
clergy
of
the
Church
of
England
from
wearing
the
cassock
,
he
was
compelled
to
assume
the
garb
of
a
civilian
.
<EOS>
His
garments
were
sombre
in
colour
,
like
those
of
the
colonel
,
but
of
a
coarser
fabric
.
<EOS>
Little
more
need
be
said
of
the
worthy
pastor
,
except
that
,
as
his
eyesight
had
begun
to
fail
him
,
he
was
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
spectacles
.
<EOS>
Dulcia
Beard
has
already
been
described
as
singularly
beautiful
,
but
sooth
to
say
,
if
her
anxiety
should
not
be
speedily
relieved
,
her
beauty
will
run
great
risk
of
being
materially
impaired
.
<EOS>
Already
,
her
cheeks
have
lost
their
bloom
,
and
the
lustre
of
her
eyes
is
sadly
dimmed
.
<EOS>
Her
manner
,
too
,
has
quite
lost
its
cheerfulness
and
she
heaves
deep
and
frequent
sighs
.
<EOS>
Patty
Whinchat
,
her
handmaiden
,
is
in
despair
about
her
young
mistress
,
and
feels
certain
,
unless
Master
Clavering
should
come
back
,
and
quickly
too
,
that
she
will
break
her
heart
.
<EOS>
Patty
can
not
understand
why
Mistress
Dulcia
should
be
so
foolish
,
seeing
that
there
are
other
young
men
in
the
world
quite
as
handsome
as
Master
Clavering
,
but
there
is
no
use
reasoning
with
her
—
pine
away
she
undoubtedly
will
,
in
spite
of
all
that
can
be
said
.
<EOS>
By
degrees
the
conversation
,
which
,
as
may
be
supposed
,
had
never
been
of
a
lively
character
,
began
to
flag
,
until
at
length
it
wholly
ceased
.
<EOS>
Fain
would
Dulcia
have
withdrawn
,
but
she
did
not
like
to
disturb
Colonel
Maunsel
,
who
remained
with
his
face
buried
in
his
hands
,
as
if
lost
in
gloomy
thought
.
<EOS>
After
a
long
pause
the
old
gentleman
roused
himself
,
as
if
by
a
great
effort
,
and
for
a
moment
gazed
vacantly
at
his
companions
.
<EOS>
“I
crave
pardon
,
”
he
said
,
as
soon
as
he
had
collected
his
scattered
thoughts
.
<EOS>
“
I
had
forgotten
that
I
was
not
alone
;
but
you
will
excuse
me
.
<EOS>
In
truth
,
I
can
bear
this
state
of
suspense
no
longer
,
and
intend
to
set
forth
for
Worcester
to-
morrow
,
and
ascertain
,
if
I
can
,
the
fate
of
my
son
.
<EOS>
”“But
consider
the
risk
you
will
run
,
my
good
sir
,
”
mildly
objected
Mr.
Beard
;
“
and
how
unfit
you
are
for
such
a
journey
.
”“Unfit
<EOS>
I
am
for
it
<EOS>
,
I
well
know
,
”
the
colonel
rejoined
,
mournfully
;
“
and
like
enough
the
effort
may
kill
me
,
but
I
may
as
well
go
as
tarry
here
,
and
die
by
inches
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
will
take
counsel
of
one
who
can
best
guide
me
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
”“Ay
,
take
counsel
of
Heaven
ere
<EOS>
you
decide
,
sir
,
”
the
clergyman
said
.
<EOS>
“My
counsellor
is
in
heaven
,
”
the
colonel
returned
.
<EOS>
“
Lend
me
your
arm
,
Dulcia
.
<EOS>
I
would
fain
arise
.
<EOS>
”Thus
<EOS>
called
upon
,
the
young
maiden
instantly
flew
to
his
assistance
,
gave
him
his
crutch
-
handled
stick
,
and
helped
to
raise
him
from
his
seat
.
<EOS>
The
old
Cavalier
got
up
with
great
difficulty
,
and
his
rheumatic
pains
extorted
a
groan
from
him
.
<EOS>
After
a
momentary
stoppage
he
moved
on
in
the
direction
of
his
wife
’s
portrait
,
halting
opposite
to
it
.
<EOS>
Dulcia
,
who
still
supported
him
,
watched
his
proceedings
with
some
surprise
,
but
she
made
no
remark
.
<EOS>
The
colonel
gazed
wistfully
at
the
portrait
,
and
then
,
in
earnest
and
supplicating
tones
,
but
so
low
as
scarcely
to
be
audible
to
Dulcia
,
besought
his
dear
departed
wife
to
give
him
some
sign
by
which
he
might
know
whether
his
design
met
with
her
approval
.
<EOS>
Filled
with
wonder
at
the
singularity
of
the
proceeding
,
Dulcia
began
to
fear
that
grief
had
turned
the
old
colonel
’s
brain
;
but
she
had
little
time
for
reflection
,
for
scarcely
were
the
words
uttered
than
a
noise
was
heard
without
in
the
corridor
,
and
the
next
moment
<EOS>
Patty
Whinchat
,
in
a
state
of
the
greatest
excitement
,
and
followed
by
an
old
serving
-
man
wearing
the
colonel
’s
livery
,
rushed
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
“That
is
my
answer
!
”
<EOS>
Colonel
Maunsel
almost
shrieked
“
What
is
it
,
woman
?
<EOS>
Speak
!
”
<EOS>
he
vociferated
.
<EOS>
“Oh
!
<EOS>
your
honour
,
John
Habergeon
is
come
back
,
”
responded
Patty
,
well
-
nigh
out
of
breath
.
<EOS>
“Has
<EOS>
he
come
alone
?
”
<EOS>
the
colonel
faltered
.
<EOS>
“No
,
your
honour
,
no
!
”
<EOS>
Martin
Geere
,
the
old
serving
-
man
,
cried
.
<EOS>
“
The
wench
has
lost
her
wits
.
<EOS>
John
has
brought
Master
Clavering
with
him
,
but
the
young
gentleman
be
in
a
sorry
plight
—
a
woful
,
sorry
plight
,
for
sure
.
<EOS>
”“But
<EOS>
he
lives
!
<EOS>
he
is
safe
!
”
<EOS>
the
colonel
exclaimed
,
in
a
transport
of
delight
.
<EOS>
“
Where
is
my
boy
?
<EOS>
Bring
him
to
me
—
bring
him
to
me
,
quick
.
<EOS>
”“He
is
here
,
your
honour
,
”
responded
the
sonorous
voice
of
John
Habergeon
from
the
corridor
.
<EOS>
Heavy
footsteps
resounded
from
the
passage
,
and
in
another
instant
the
old
trooper
appeared
,
sustaining
his
young
master
with
his
stalwart
arm
.
<EOS>
Leading
Clavering
to
the
nearest
chair
,
he
deposited
him
within
it
,
with
as
much
tenderness
and
solicitude
as
could
be
exhibited
by
a
nurse
towards
a
sick
man
.
<EOS>
On
beholding
his
son
,
the
colonel
uttered
a
cry
,
and
shaking
off
in
his
excitement
the
rigidity
of
his
limbs
,
and
seeking
for
no
support
,
rushed
towards
him
with
a
quickness
which
,
under
other
circumstances
,
would
not
have
been
possible
.
<EOS>
Dulcia
and
Mr.
Beard
followed
,
but
remained
standing
at
a
little
distance
,
unwilling
to
interrupt
the
meeting
between
father
and
son
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
several
others
of
the
household
,
male
and
female
,
had
flocked
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
These
persons
,
when
he
had
placed
his
young
master
in
the
chair
,
as
before
related
,
John
Habergeon
took
upon
him
to
dismiss
.
<EOS>
In
good
sooth
,
Clavering
Maunsel
was
in
a
sorry
plight
.
<EOS>
His
apparel
was
soiled
and
torn
;
and
the
jerkin
,
over
which
he
had
worn
a
corslet
on
the
field
,
was
stained
with
blood
.
<EOS>
His
long
dark
locks
were
dishevelled
and
unkempt
,
as
if
he
had
gone
bareheaded
for
days
;
and
such
,
indeed
,
was
the
fact
.
<EOS>
His
lineaments
were
ghastly
pale
from
loss
of
blood
and
other
suffering
;
and
his
right
arm
appeared
to
be
broken
,
for
it
was
bound
up
,
and
supported
by
the
very
scarf
which
Dulcia
had
embroidered
for
him
.
<EOS>
“My
boy
—
my
dear
boy
!
<EOS>
how
I
joy
to
see
thee
back
again
!
”
<EOS>
the
old
colonel
exclaimed
,
embracing
him
,
and
bending
over
him
with
effusion
.
<EOS>
“
I
had
well
-
nigh
given
thee
up
for
lost
.
<EOS>
”“You
must
thank
John
Habergeon
for
bringing
me
to
you
,
father
,
”
Clavering
replied
.
<EOS>
“
Without
him
,
you
would
never
have
beheld
me
more
.
<EOS>
But
why
come
not
Dulcia
and
her
honoured
father
nigh
me
?
<EOS>
I
long
to
greet
them
,
but
am
too
much
exhausted
to
rise
.
<EOS>
”Thus
<EOS>
summoned
,
the
young
maiden
was
instantly
by
his
side
.
<EOS>
Clavering
extended
his
uninjured
arm
towards
her
,
feebly
pressing
her
hand
,
and
fixing
a
tender
look
upon
her
,
while
she
remained
gazing
upon
him
with
tearful
eyes
.
<EOS>
The
good
divine
next
came
in
for
his
share
of
the
wounded
man
’s
notice
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
shall
die
content
now
that
I
have
seen
you
all
once
more
,
”
Clavering
cried
,
in
a
feeble
voice
,
and
half
closing
his
eyes
,
as
he
sank
back
in
the
chair
.
<EOS>
“Tut
!
<EOS>
tut
!
<EOS>
talk
not
of
dying
!
”
<EOS>
Colonel
Maunsel
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
“
I
tell
thee
thou
shalt
live
—
live
and
grow
hearty
again
,
and
shalt
carry
havoc
amongst
those
canting
Roundheads
and
rebels
.
<EOS>
I
was
worse
hurt
at
Naseby
than
thou
art
,
and
should
speedily
have
recovered
from
my
wounds
,
had
I
been
properly
tended
,
and
not
lodged
in
that
pestilent
castle
of
Chester
,
where
the
prison
fever
took
me
and
brought
me
to
the
gates
of
death
,
leaving
me
ever
afterward
stiff
of
joint
and
lame
of
limb
,
so
that
I
can
neither
mount
horse
nor
bear
sword
.
<EOS>
But
thou
shalt
get
well
again
in
less
than
a
month
,
I
warrant
thee
,
Clavering
,
and
be
ready
once
more
to
fight
the
king
’s
enemies
.
<EOS>
Thou
hast
youth
and
a
sound
constitution
to
back
thee
,
and
need’st
fear
nothing
.
<EOS>
”“He
<EOS>
looks
very
faint
!
”
<EOS>
Dulcia
exclaimed
,
anxiously
.
<EOS>
“
A
cup
of
wine
,
methinks
,
would
do
him
good
.
<EOS>
”“Well
<EOS>
thought
of
,
girl
,
”
the
colonel
cried
.
<EOS>
“
A
cup
of
wine
instantly
.
”“Captain
<EOS>
Clavering
is
suffering
more
from
weakness
and
want
of
nourishment
than
from
his
wounds
,
”
John
Habergeon
said
,
filling
a
goblet
with
sack
,
and
handing
it
to
Dulcia
.
<EOS>
“
Give
it
to
him
,
fair
mistress
,
”
he
continued
,
with
a
gruff
kind
of
gallantry
.
<EOS>
“
The
cup
will
taste
better
from
your
hands
than
mine
;
”
adding
,
in
a
tone
calculated
only
for
her
ear
,
<EOS>
“
he
hath
talked
of
scarce
<EOS>
any
one
else
save
you
since
he
got
his
wounds
.
<EOS>
”Blushing
<EOS>
deeply
,
but
taking
no
notice
of
this
embarrassing
whisper
,
Dulcia
gave
the
goblet
to
Clavering
,
who
looked
at
her
fixedly
as
he
raised
it
to
his
lips
.
<EOS>
Just
then
,
the
groom
of
the
kitchen
,
Giles
Moppett
,
accompanied
by
Martin
Geere
and
Patty
Whinchat
,
entered
the
hall
,
bringing
materials
for
a
plentiful
repast
,
which
they
proceeded
to
place
upon
the
table
with
all
possible
expedition
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
the
larder
happened
to
be
well
stocked
.
<EOS>
The
viands
were
chiefly
of
a
substantial
character
—
so
much
the
better
,
John
Habergeon
thought
,
as
he
looked
on
,
almost
with
a
wolfish
eye
,
while
the
dishes
were
being
set
upon
the
board
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
mountainous
roast
round
of
beef
,
a
couple
of
boiled
pullets
,
little
the
worse
for
their
previous
appearance
at
the
board
,
a
dish
of
larks
,
a
huge
pigeon
-
pie
,
and
,
better
than
all
,
the
remains
of
a
mangificent
roast
bustard
—
bustards
were
then
to
be
met
with
on
the
South
Downs
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
arrangements
for
this
impromptu
supper
were
completed
,
Clavering
,
upon
whom
the
generous
liquor
he
had
swallowed
had
produced
a
very
beneficial
effect
,
was
borne
to
the
table
by
his
father
’s
directions
,
without
moving
him
from
the
chair
wherein
he
sat
.
<EOS>
Giles
Moppett
,
who
acted
as
carver
,
then
inquired
what
his
young
master
would
be
pleased
to
take
;
but
Clavering
refused
to
touch
anything
till
John
Habergeon
had
been
served
,
and
bade
Moppett
fill
a
plate
with
roast
beef
for
the
old
trooper
.
<EOS>
John
was
far
too
hungry
to
be
bashful
,
so
he
sat
down
,
as
he
was
enjoined
to
do
,
and
speedily
cleared
his
plate
,
which
was
promptly
replenished
by
Moppett
.
<EOS>
The
old
trooper
was
no
indifferent
trencherman
in
a
general
way
;
but
just
now
he
seemed
to
possess
an
inexhaustible
appetite
,
eating
like
one
half
famished
.
<EOS>
After
doing
prodigious
execution
upon
the
round
of
beef
,
he
devoured
a
leg
and
a
wing
of
the
bustard
—
no
trifling
feat
in
itself
—
only
pausing
occasionally
in
his
task
to
empty
a
flagon
of
nut
-
brown
ale
,
poured
out
for
him
by
the
attentive
Martin
Geere
.
<EOS>
Finally
,
he
attacked
the
pigeon
-
pie
,
and
soon
made
a
great
hole
in
it
.
<EOS>
His
prowess
was
watched
with
infinite
satisfaction
by
Colonel
Maunsel
,
who
encouraged
him
to
go
on
,
repeatedly
ordering
Giles
Moppett
to
fill
his
plate
anew
.
<EOS>
At
first
,
Clavering
ate
sparingly
and
slowly
,
but
as
he
gained
strength
his
appetite
increased
,
and
if
he
could
have
used
both
hands
,
he
might
,
perchance
,
have
rivalled
John
Habergeon
’s
wondrous
performances
,
for
he
seemed
to
have
fasted
as
long
as
the
old
trooper
.
<EOS>
But
notwithstanding
his
insatiable
hunger
,
the
young
man
took
good
care
to
call
in
Dulcia
’s
aid
to
cut
up
his
meat
for
him
,
which
he
was
certainly
entitled
to
do
,
seeing
that
he
could
not
perform
the
task
for
himself
.
<EOS>
A
pause
,
however
,
in
this
terrible
masticating
process
having
at
length
arrived
,
on
Clavering
’s
side
,
at
least
—
for
John
,
it
seemed
,
would
never
cease
—
Colonel
Maunsel
thought
he
might
venture
to
ask
for
some
particulars
of
his
son
’s
escape
after
the
battle
.
<EOS>
The
first
inquiries
however
,
of
the
loyal
old
gentleman
were
,
whether
Clavering
knew
aught
of
the
king?“I
trust
his
Majesty
has
escaped
his
enemies
,
father
,
”
the
young
man
replied
;
“
but
I
have
heard
nothing
concerning
him
since
I
was
separated
from
him
,
in
the
manner
I
will
proceed
to
recount
to
you
.
<EOS>
After
the
rout
on
that
unlucky
day
,
when
all
went
against
us
,
and
the
king
was
compelled
to
retire
,
I
had
the
honour
of
forming
part
of
the
small
escort
that
attended
him
,
having
previously
assisted
,
with
my
Lord
Cleveland
and
Colonel
Wogan
,
in
covering
his
retreat
from
the
city
.
<EOS>
We
rode
off
at
nightfall
in
the
direction
of
Stourbridge
,
his
Majesty
having
decided
upon
taking
refuge
at
Boscobel
House
,
whither
Mr.
Charles
Giffard
,
than
whom
there
breathes
not
a
more
loyal
gentleman
,
had
undertaken
to
conduct
him
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
know
Charles
Giffard
<EOS>
well
,
”
Colonel
Maunsel
remarked
,
“
and
can
avouch
,
from
my
personal
knowledge
,
that
he
is
as
loyal
as
thou
hast
described
him
.
<EOS>
I
also
know
Boscobel
,
and
White
Ladies
,
another
house
belonging
to
the
Giffards
,
and
in
either
place
his
Majesty
would
find
a
secure
retreat
.
<EOS>
The
king
could
not
be
in
better
hands
than
those
of
loyal
Charles
Giffard
.
<EOS>
But
go
on
,
my
son
;
how
far
didst
accompany
his
Majesty?”“Within
a
mile
of
Stourbridge
,
”
Clavering
replied
;
“
when
we
were
attacked
by
a
troop
of
the
enemy
’s
horse
,
and
the
king
was
exposed
to
much
peril
,
running
great
risk
of
capture
.
”“Capture
!
<EOS>
‘
Sdeath
!
<EOS>
you
would
none
of
you
have
suffered
those
vile
knaves
to
lay
hands
on
his
Majesty
’s
sacred
person
!
”
<EOS>
the
old
colonel
exclaimed
,
his
eye
blazing
fiercely
,
and
his
limbs
trembling
with
passion
.
<EOS>
“
Oh
!
that
I
had
been
there
,
with
an
arm
as
strong
as
that
which
I
boasted
before
Naseby
!
<EOS>
What
didst
thou
do
,
boy?”“That
which
you
would
have
done
yourself
,
sir
,
”
Clavering
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
I
used
your
sword
to
some
purpose
against
the
crop
-
eared
curs
,
and
made
them
feel
the
edge
of
the
weapon
.
<EOS>
Finding
the
king
beset
by
the
captain
of
the
troop
and
three
or
four
of
his
men
,
who
had
recognized
his
Majesty
,
and
were
shouting
out
‘
that
the
Lord
of
Hosts
had
delivered
Abijam
,
the
son
of
Rehoboam
,
into
their
hands
,
’
and
were
menacing
him
with
death
if
he
did
not
yield
himself
up
to
them
,
I
fired
my
pistol
at
the
head
of
their
leader
,
and
throwing
myself
upon
the
others
,
assailed
them
so
furiously
,
that
the
king
was
able
to
extricate
himself
from
them
and
get
clear
off
.
<EOS>
”“What
!
<EOS>
thou
hast
been
the
happy
instrument
of
saving
his
Majesty
’s
life
—
thou
,
my
darling
son
?
”
<EOS>
the
old
Cavalier
exclaimed
,
in
tones
half
broken
by
the
deep
emotion
which
he
vainly
endeavoured
to
repress
.
<EOS>
“
By
Saint
George
!
<EOS>
thou
hast
done
well
,
<EOS>
Clavering
—
thou
hast
done
well
.
<EOS>
And
if
thou
hadst
perished
in
the
act
,
thou
wouldst
have
died
the
death
which
I
myself
should
have
most
coveted
—
a
death
worthy
of
one
of
our
loyal
house
.
<EOS>
”“But
,
Heaven
be
praised
,
my
brave
young
friend
is
spared
to
us
!

ejaculated

<EOS>
“
May
he
be
preserved
to
be
a
prop
to
your
declining
years
,
sir
,
”
he
added
to
the
colonel
.
<EOS>
“May
<EOS>
he
be
preserved
to
aid
in
King
Charles
’
restoration
,
that
is
all
I
pray
for
!
”
<EOS>
the
old
Cavalier
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
“I
cry
‘
Amen
’
to
that
prayer
,
father
,
”
the
young
man
rejoined
,
fervently
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
Dulcia
had
abstained
from
speech
,
though
her
cheek
had
glowed
during
Clavering
’s
narration
.
<EOS>
She
now
ventured
to
remark:“But
<EOS>
you
have
more
to
tell
us
of
that
desperate
encounter
,
have
you
not
?
<EOS>
It
was
there
that
you
received
your
hurts?”“You
<EOS>
are
right
,
Dulcia
,
”
Clavering
replied
.
<EOS>
“
His
Majesty
,
whom
Heaven
preserve
!
had
got
off
as
I
have
informed
you
,
but
I
myself
was
surrounded
,
and
had
a
sharp
conflict
with
the
base
knaves
,
from
whom
I
neither
expected
to
receive
quarter
,
nor
would
have
deigned
to
accept
it
,
and
who
,
moreover
,
as
you
may
guess
,
were
mightily
enraged
at
the
king
’s
escape
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
my
right
arm
was
disabled
by
the
blow
of
a
pike
,
and
being
thus
at
the
mercy
of
the
murtherous
rascals
,
I
should
have
been
despatched
outright
,
if
it
had
not
been
for
John
Habergeon—”“Say
not
a
word
about
me
,
<EOS>
captain
<EOS>
,
I
beseech
you
,
”
the
old
trooper
interrupted
,
looking
up
with
his
mouth
full
of
pigeon
-
pie
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
marvelled
where
John
could
have
been
all
this
while
,
”
the
colonel
observed
.
<EOS>
“
I
thought
he
could
not
have
been
far
off
.
<EOS>
”“John
was
by
my
side
,
sir
,
”
Clavering
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
By
my
side
,
did
I
say
?
<EOS>
He
was
in
front
—
at
the
rear
—
on
the
right
—
at
the
left
—
everywhere
warding
off
blows
aimed
at
me
,
and
doing
terrible
execution
upon
the
rebels
.
<EOS>
But
even
John
could
not
save
me
from
being
thrown
from
my
steed
,
and
trampled
under
foot
by
the
Roundhead
troopers
,
who
tried
to
dash
out
my
brains
with
their
horses
’
heels
.
<EOS>
The
stoutness
of
my
casque
saved
me
from
their
malice
,
and
my
breastplate
protected
me
from
all
other
harm
except
some
trifling
<EOS>
bruises—”“Call
<EOS>
you
hurts
such
as
yours
trifling
,
my
good
young
friend
?
”
<EOS>
the
pastor
cried
.
<EOS>
“
You
must
needs
have
a
frame
of
iron
to
bear
such
injuries
,
and
speak
lightly
of
them
.
<EOS>
”“‘Fore
<EOS>
Heaven
!
<EOS>
Clavering
is
as
tough
as
his
father
,
”
the
old
colonel
remarked
,
smiling
complacently
;
“
and
can
bear
much
knocking
about
.
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
like
a
close
headpiece
with
great
cheeks
,
and
a
stout
corslet
and
cuissarts
,
if
you
have
the
ill
luck
to
be
hurled
on
the
ground
and
ridden
over
.
<EOS>
Your
well-
tempered
breastplate
stood
you
in
good
stead
on
this
occasion
,
boy
.
”“It
<EOS>
was
much
dinted
<EOS>
,
I
promise
you
,
father
,
”
Clavering
replied
.
<EOS>
“
Howbeit
,
I
escaped
with
life
,
though
those
caitiff
troopers
declared
they
would
send
me
to
perdition
.
”“Heaven
<EOS>
open
their
own
eyes
and
save
them
from
the
pit
!
”
<EOS>
the
clergyman
ejaculated
.
<EOS>
“Nay
,
such
spawn
of
Satan
deserve
not
your
intercession
for
them
,
reverend
sir
,
”
the
old
Cavalier
exclaimed
,
impetuously
.
<EOS>
“
I
would
despatch
such
devil
’s
servants
to
their
master
without
an
instant
’s
scruple
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
John
,
my
worthy
friend
<EOS>
,
”
he
added
to
the
old
trooper
,
who
was
still
quietly
pursuing
his
meal
,
as
if
in
no
wise
concerned
in
Clavering
’s
relation
,
“
I
estimated
thee
aright
.
<EOS>
I
knew
thou
wouldst
be
serviceable
to
my
son
.
<EOS>
”“I
would
not
have
stirred
a
foot
for
those
cursed
Roundhead
curs
,
your
honour
,
”
John
Habergeon
replied
;
“
but
I
wanted
to
draw
them
from
Captain
Clavering
as
the
sole
means
of
saving
his
life
,
so
I
made
pretence
of
flight
,
and
the
rascals
galloped
after
me
.
<EOS>
They
shot
my
horse
,
but
I
got
off
scathless
.
<EOS>
”“Thou
art
<EOS>
a
brave
fellow
,
John
,
”
the
colonel
said“Brave
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
and
trusty
as
brave
!
”
<EOS>
Clavering
cried
.
<EOS>
“
He
rescued
me
from
certain
destruction
.
<EOS>
I
was
unable
to
stir
from
the
spot
where
I
fell
,
and
if
those
butcherly
Roundheads
had
returned
,
or
others
of
their
side
had
come
up
and
found
me
lying
there
and
still
breathing
,
they
would
infallibly
have
knocked
out
my
brains
.
<EOS>
”“Now
to
look
at
dear
,
good
John
Habergeon
,
no
one
would
guess
what
a
warm
heart
he
possesses
,
”
Dulcia
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
“
I
ever
liked
him
;
but
I
knew
not
his
true
worth
till
now
.
<EOS>
”“Men
must
not
be
judged
by
their
exterior

”
Mr.
Beard
said
.
<EOS>
“
The
sweetest
kernel
hath
sometimes
the
roughest
shell
.
<EOS>
”“Just
<EOS>
as
the
best
blade
may
be
found
in
an
ill
scabbard
,
”
the
colonel
said
.
<EOS>
“
John
is
somewhat
harsh
of
feature
,
it
must
be
owned
,
but
he
hath
a
right
honest
look
.
<EOS>
You
would
never
mistake
him
for
a
Puritan
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
trow
not
,
your
honour
,
if
a
real
Puritan
were
nigh
,
”
the
old
trooper
replied
,
with
a
grin
.
<EOS>
“
But
enough
,
methinks
,
has
been
said
about
me
.
<EOS>
”“Not
half
enough
,
”
Clavering
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
I
have
not
told
you
a
tithe
of
what
John
did
for
me
,
father
.
<EOS>
When
you
know
all
,
you
will
comprehend
how
much
gratitude
I
owe
him
.
<EOS>
He
bore
me
in
his
arms
from
the
scene
of
strife
to
a
place
of
safety
,
where
he
set
my
broken
arm
,
and
put
splints
,
which
he
himself
quickly
prepared
as
well
as
any
surgeon
could
have
done
,
over
the
fracture
,
bound
up
the
limb
,
dressed
my
bruises
,
and
,
this
done
,
he
again
carried
me
to
a
barn
,
where
we
passed
the
night
,
<EOS>
John
watching
by
me
all
the
while
.
<EOS>
After
some
hours
’
rest
I
was
able
to
move
,
and
we
set
out
before
daybreak
across
the
country
,
as
near
as
we
could
conjecture
in
the
direction
of
Stratford
.
<EOS>
We
made
but
slow
progress
,
for
I
was
very
stiff
and
weak
;
but
John
lent
me
all
the
aid
he
could
,
cheering
me
on
,
and
talking
to
me
of
home
and
of
those
I
loved
,
when
I
was
half
inclined
to
lie
down
in
despair
.
<EOS>
As
the
day
advanced
,
he
procured
me
some
milk
and
bread
,
without
which
I
could
no
longer
have
gone
on
,
for
I
had
tasted
nothing
since
the
previous
morn
—
the
morn
<EOS>
,
you
will
remember
,
of
the
fatal
battle
.
<EOS>
Having
partaken
of
this
food
,
I
was
enabled
to
continue
my
journey
,
and
ere
night
we
had
found
shelter
in
a
thicket
between
Stratford
and
Long
Marston
,
when
John
left
me
for
a
while
to
procure
fresh
provisions
for
our
support
.
<EOS>
The
faithful
fellow
came
back
,
bringing
with
him
meat
and
a
bottle
of
stout
ale
;
but
though
half
famished
,
he
would
touch
nothing
himself
till
I
had
eaten
and
drunk
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
be
brief
,
for
this
talking
is
too
much
for
me
.
<EOS>
During
the
whole
of
our
toilsome
journey
hither
,
exposed
as
we
have
been
to
constant
hazard
from
the
Republican
troops
which
are
scouring
the
country
in
every
direction
,
dreading
almost
to
show
our
faces
lest
we
should
be
set
upon
by
some
Roundhead
churls
,
resting
now
in
a
wood
,
now
beneath
a
haystack
,
but
never
under
a
roof
,
obtaining
food
with
difficulty
,
and
the
little
we
got
of
the
coarsest
kind
—
during
all
these
difficulties
and
dangers
,
my
trusty
companion
,
who
might
easily
have
provided
for
his
own
safety
,
kept
ever
by
my
side
,
and
tended
me
,
cheered
me
,
watched
over
me
—
nay
,
actually
in
two
instances
saved
me
from
capture
with
his
good
right
hand
,
for
I
could
do
nothing
in
my
own
defence
—
and
finally
succeeded
in
bringing
me
home
in
safety
.
”“Blessings
<EOS>
upon
him
for
his
noble
conduct
!
”
<EOS>
the
clergyman
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
“Ay
,
blessings
upon
him
!
”
reiterated
both
the
colonel
and
Dulcia
.
<EOS>
“Well
,
it
is
all
right
now
,
since
I
am
back
again
at
the
dear
old
house
,
”
Clavering
continued
.
<EOS>
“
As
to
my
wounds
,
I
heed
them
not
.
<EOS>
They
will
soon
heal
.
<EOS>
But
the
thought
of
how
I
got
them
will
last
during
the
rest
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
”“Thou
art
a
true
Maunsel
,
every
inch
of
thee
,
Clavering
,
”
his
father
cried
,
in
approval
.
<EOS>
“
What
signifies
a
limb
lost
,
or
a
drop
of
blood
the
less
in
one
’s
veins
,
if
we
have
done
good
service
to
the
royal
cause
.
<EOS>
And
thou
hast
saved
the
king
’s
life
.
<EOS>
Think
of
that
—
think
of
that
,
Clavering
Maunsel
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
do
think
of
it
,
”
the
young
Cavalier
replied
.
<EOS>
“I
crave
your
honour
’s
leave
to
propose
a
toast
,
”
John
Habergeon
cried
,
rising
.
<EOS>
“Thou
hast
my
full
licence
to
do
so
,
”
Colonel
Maunsel
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
Fill
thine
own
glass
from
that
flask
of
Malvoisie
to
the
brim
,
and
all
of
us
will
follow
thine
example
.
<EOS>
Even
fair
Mistress
Dulcia
will
not
refuse
thy
pledge
.
<EOS>
”“Nay
,
that
I
will
not
,
in
good
sooth

,
”
Dulcia
cried
.
<EOS>
“You
will
all
do
me
reason
,
I
am
sure
,
when
you
hear
my
toast
,
”
John
said
.
<EOS>
“
A
health
to
King
Charles
,
and
may
God
preserve
him
from
his
enemies!”All
arose
;
the
colonel
unassisted
,
for
his
new
-
found
activity
had
not
yet
deserted
him
;
and
Clavering
contrived
to
get
up
from
his
chair
.
<EOS>
The
glasses
being
filled
,
the
toast
was
drunk
by
the
whole
company
,
including
even
Dulcia
,
who
raised
the
goblet
to
her
lips
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Maunsel
repeated
the
words
pronounced
by
the
loyal
old
trooper
with
great
fervour
and
solemnity
;
adding
,
“
I
will
put
a
rider
to
thy
toast
,
John
,
and
drink
to
his
Majesty
’s
speedy
restoration
.
”While
<EOS>
the
party
was
thus
occupied
,
none
of
them
were
aware
that
their
proceedings
were
watched
from
the
bay
-
window
on
the
left
by
a
sallow
-
faced
,
sinister
-
looking
personage
,
habited
in
a
Geneva
cloak
and
bands
,
and
wearing
a
tall
steeple
-
crowned
hat
on
his
head
.
<EOS>
We
have
said
that
this
spy
was
unobserved
by
all
the
party
;
but
his
presence
did
not
pass
unnoticed
by
the
quick
eyes
of
Patty
Whinchat
,
who
entered
the
hall
just
as
the
treasonable
toast
(
for
such
it
would
sound
in
the
ears
of
a
Republican
)
had
been
drunk
.
<EOS>
“Mercy
on
us
!
”
<EOS>
Patty
screamed
.
<EOS>
“
There
’s
a
man
at
the
window
.
<EOS>
”“What
<EOS>
say’st
thou
,
wench
?
<EOS>
A
man
at
the
window
!
”
<EOS>
Colonel
Maunsel
cried
.
<EOS>
“
Go
and
see
,
John
.
<EOS>
I
can
discern
no
one
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
old
trooper
did
not
require
bidding
twice
,
but
rushed
to
the
bay
-
window
indicated
by
Patty
.
<EOS>
However
,
he
could
perceive
nothing
to
justify
the
girl
’s
alarm
,
and
told
the
colonel
as
much
.
<EOS>
“What
manner
of
man
didst
fancy
thou
sawest
,
wench
?
”
<EOS>
the
colonel
cried
.
<EOS>
“It
was
no
fancy
,
your
honour
;
I
’m
sure
I
saw
him
,
”
Patty
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
I
saw
his
hatchet
-
face
,
and
his
cat’s
-
eyes
,
and
his
tall
,
sugar
-
loaf
hat
,
and
his
Geneva
cloak
and
bands—”“Oons
!
<EOS>
that
should
be
Increase
Micklegift
,
from
thy
description
,
wench
,
”
the
colonel
interrupted
.
<EOS>
“It
was
Increase
Micklegift
whom
I
beheld
,
”
Patty
replied
.
<EOS>
“
I
’ll
swear
to
his
ugly
nose
.
<EOS>
”“No
occasion
for
swearing
,
Patty
,
”
the
clergyman
remarked
.
<EOS>
“
We
will
believe
your
simple
affirmation
.
<EOS>
”“Go
<EOS>
and
send
some
one
forth
,
Moppett
<EOS>
,
”
the
colonel
said
to
the
groom
of
the
kitchen
,
“
to
ascertain
whether
this
pestilent
rascal
be
indeed
within
the
garden
,
or
elsewhere
lurking
about
the
premises
.
”“I’ll
<EOS>
go
myself
,
”
John
Habergeon
rejoined
;
“
and
if
I
catch
him
,
I
’ll
treat
him
as
I
would

hen
-
roost
plunderer
.
<EOS>
”“Nay
,
harm
him
not
,
”
the
clergyman
cried
;
“
but
admonish
him
.
<EOS>
”“Ay
<EOS>
,
ay
,
I
’ll
admonish
him
,
your
reverence
,
”
John
Habergeon
replied
,
“
—
with
a
cudgel
.
<EOS>
”This
<EOS>
incident
caused
Colonel
Maunsel
considerable
uneasiness
,
and
somewhat
abated
his
satisfaction
at
his
son
’s
return
.
<EOS>
Clavering
,
he
well
knew
,
might
at
any
moment
be
arrested
as
a
traitor
to
the
Commonwealth
,
for
having
borne
arms
for
his
lawful
sovereign
,
and
might
even
suffer
death
for
a
display
of
loyalty
,
which
the
Rump
Parliament
regarded
in
the
light
of
high
treason
.
<EOS>
Since
Clavering
was
in
this
danger
,
it
was
necessary
that
the
utmost
caution
should
be
observed
in
regard
to
him
;
and
though
the
colonel
could
rely
upon
his
household
to
maintain
perfect
secrecy
as
to
their
young
master
’s
return
,
yet
if
Increase
Micklegift
had
become
aware
of
the
fact
,
concealment
would
be
hopeless
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
Colonel
Maunsel
felt
satisfied
,
from
his
knowledge
of
the
Independent
minister
’s
character
,
that
he
would
not
hesitate
to
denounce
Clavering
.
<EOS>
These
considerations
,
as
we
have
said
,
greatly
alarmed
the
old
Cavalier
;
but
he
was
somewhat
reassured
by
John
Habergeon
,
who
,
on
his
return
,
after
some
quarter
of
an
hour
’s
absence
,
declared
that
he
,
with
Giles
Moppett
and
Martin
Geere
,
had
carefully
searched
the
garden
without
finding
any
traces
of
the
supposed
spy
.
<EOS>
But
,
to
make
all
sure
,
they
had
gone
up
to
the
old
rectory
,
where
the
Independent
minister
had
taken
up
his
abode
since
Mr.
Beard
’s
secession
,
and
knocking
at
the
door
,
had
been
answered
by
Increase
himself
from
his
chamber
window
,
who
bade
them
be
gone
about
their
business
,
and
not
disturb
him
at
that
unseasonable
hour
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
This
latter
piece
of
information
was
well
calculated
to
allay
the
colonel
’s
fears
,
and
he
began
to
agree
with
John
Habergeon
,
that
Patty
Whinchat
,
in
spite
of
her
positive
assertions
to
the
contrary
,
must
have
been
mistaken
,
and
could
not
have
beheld
the
mischievous
Independent
divine
.
<EOS>
Deeming
,
therefore
,
that
further
precautionary
measures
were
unneeded
for
the
night
—
whatever
might
be
requisite
on
the
morrow
<EOS>
—
he
saw
his
son
conducted
to
his
chamber
by
John
Habergeon
(
Clavering
’s
parting
with
Dulcia
must
be
left
to
the
fair
reader
’s
imagination
)
,
and
tarried
with
him
for
some
time
,
when
he
himself
sought
his
couch
.
<EOS>
Long
ere
this
,
all
the
other
inmates
of
Ovingdean
Grange
had
retired
to
rest
,
happier
than
they
had
been
for
many
days
.

As
A
Passage
For
SmokeDOMICILIARY
visits
to
the
residences
of
country
gentlemen
noted
for
their
fidelity
to
the
Crown
were
so
frequent
at
the
period
,
that
almost
every
house
belonging
to
an
adherent
to
the
royal
cause
was
provided
with
a
hiding
-
place
,
wherein
a
kinsman
,
whose
proceedings
had
jeopardized
his
safety
,
or
a
fugitive
Cavalier
,
seeking
shelter
from
the
foe
,
might
be
secreted
until
the
danger
should
have
passed
by
.
<EOS>
Ovingdean
Grange
possessed
a
retreat
of
this
kind
,
very
skilfully
fabricated
amidst
the
brickwork
of
a
large
external
chimney
at
the
north
-
east
angle
of
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
No
indication
of
the
hiding
-
place
was
perceptible
from
without
,
even
on
careful
examination
.
<EOS>
The
chimney
had
nothing
unusual
in
its
shape
,
though
of
great
size
;
large
chimneys
being
common
enough
in
old
Sussex
houses
,
as
may
be
observed
in
many
still
in
existence
.
<EOS>
The
lurking
-
place
,
as
may
be
supposed
,
was
extremely
contracted
in
its
dimensions
,
and
would
just
hold
two
persons
.
<EOS>
Built
in
juxtaposition
with
the
chimney
funnel
,
it
sprang
to
a
height
sufficient
to
enable
its
occupants
to
stand
upright
within
it
.
<EOS>
Light
and
air
were
admitted
by
a
narrow
loophole
,
screened
from
observation
by
a
grotesque
stone
gargoyle
projecting
from
the
roof
of
the
building
.
<EOS>
Access
to
the
spot
was
of
course
obtained
from
within
.
<EOS>
In
a
spacious
bed
-
chamber
at
the
rear
of
the
house
,
used
by
Colonel
Maunsel
himself
,
there
was
a
large
oak
chimney
-
piece
,
the
left
jamb
of
which
,
carved
as
a
pilaster
,
turned
upon
a
pivot
,
and
could
be
instantly
set
in
motion
by
a
spring
concealed
amidst
the
foliage
of
the
capital
.
<EOS>
On
opening
this
secret
door
an
aperture
was
disclosed
large
enough
to
admit
a
man
,
and
communicating
with
a
narrow
passage
constructed
within
the
thickness
of
the
walls
.
<EOS>
A
second
obstacle
,
however
,
was
set
in
the
way
of
the
searchers
<EOS>
,
should
they
have
succeeded
in
penetrating
thus
far
.
<EOS>
Within
a
couple
of
yards
of
the
fireplace
,
the
passage
was
blocked
up
by
what
seemed
solid
masonry
;
but
the
impediment
,
though
apparently
insurmountable
,
could
easily
be
removed
by
touching
a
second
spring
.
<EOS>
Beyond
this
,
the
passage
was
free
,
and
soon
terminated
in
the
small
chamber
already
described
.
<EOS>
This
hiding
-
place
naturally
occurred
to
Colonel
Maunsel
,
as
he
lay
awake
,
and
painfully
ruminating
,
on
the
night
of
his
son
’s
return
to
the
Grange
.
<EOS>
But
though
the
asylum
might
be
a
secure
one
,
in
case
Clavering
should
be
denounced
by
Increase
Micklegift
(
for
the
colonel
could
not
wholly
shake
off
the
apprehension
of
this
possibility
)
,
yet
recourse
must
not
be
had
to
it
,
except
at
the
last
extremity
,
since
the
occupation
for
any
length
of
time
of
such
a
narrow
cell
by
the
young
man
,
in
his
present
wounded
and
enfeebled
state
,
might
be
productive
of
most
disastrous
consequences
.
<EOS>
The
best
thing
to
be
done
<EOS>
,
it
seemed
to
the
colonel
,
was
to
bring
Clavering
to
his
own
room
,
so
that
the
young
man
might
take
instant
refuge
within
the
hidden
chamber
,
in
case
the
house
should
be
menaced
with
a
perquisition
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
,
none
of
the
household
,
except
trusty
John
Habergeon
,
were
acquainted
with
the
hiding
-
place
,
so
that
no
threats
or
maltreatment
on
the
part
of
the
searchers
could
extort
from
them
a
revelation
of
the
secret
.
<EOS>
All
continued
tranquil
,
however
,
during
the
night
.
<EOS>
Worn
out
with
the
extraordinary
fatigue
and
privations
he
had
undergone
,
Clavering
slept
so
soundly
,
that
if
the
malevolent
Independent
minister
,
accompanied
by
a
dozen
Roundhead
musketeers
,
had
knocked
at
his
door
,
he
would
scarce
have
been
aroused
.
<EOS>
John
Habergeon
,
who
occupied
a
truckle
-
bed
in
his
young
master
’s
room
,
slept
soundly
too
,
but
the
old
trooper
had
the
vigilance
of
a
watchdog
,
and
would
have
been
up
,
and
on
the
alert
,
on
the
slightest
disturbance
.
<EOS>
A
pair
of
pistols
lay
within
his
reach
,
in
case
of
a
surprise
.
<EOS>
Long
before
daybreak
,
Colonel
Maunsel
,
who
had
slept
but
little
,
as
we
have
stated
,
arose
,
and
wrapping
himself
in
a
dressing
-
gown
,
took
a
taper
,
which
burnt
within
his
chamber
,
and
proceeded
to
inspect
the
hiding
-
place
.
<EOS>
Both
the
secret
springs
acted
perfectly
,
and
the
cell
seemed
as
dry
and
comfortable
as
such
a
place
could
well
be
;
indeed
,
its
contiguity
to
the
chimney
funnel
kept
it
warm
.
<EOS>
Still
it
must
be
fitted
up
yet
more
conveniently
for
Clavering
’s
reception
.
<EOS>
Fraught
with
this
resolve
,
and
in
order
that
no
time
might
be
lost
,
the
colonel
repaired
at
once
to
his
son
’s
room
,
marvelling
within
himself
,
as
he
went
,
that
he
was
able
to
move
about
in
this
way
without
assistance
.
<EOS>
But
strength
seemed
to
have
been
given
him
for
the
perilous
conjuncture
.
<EOS>
John
Habergeon
started
up
as
he
entered
the
room
,
and
the
first
impulse
of
the
old
trooper
was
to
seize
the
pistols
lying
beside
him
,
but
he
instantly
laid
down
the
weapons
on
recognizing
the
intruder
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Maunsel
desired
him
,
in
a
low
tone
,
to
come
with
him
,
and
John
having
huddled
on
his
garments
as
expeditiously
as
he
could
,
they
quitted
the
room
together
,
without
disturbing
the
wounded
sleeper
.
<EOS>
Acting
under
the
colonel
’s
directions
,
John
placed
a
variety
of
articles
within
the
cell
,
likely
to
be
required
by
Clavering
,
if
he
should
be
forced
to
occupy
it
;
and
these
arrangements
being
satisfactorily
made
,
and
the
secret
door
restored
to
its
customary
position
,
the
old
trooper
looked
at
his
master
,
as
if
awaiting
further
orders
,
and
receiving
none
,
he
observed:“A
plan
has
just
occurred
to
me
for
deceiving
the
enemy
,
which
,
with
your
honour
’s
permission
,
I
would
fain
put
into
execution
without
delay
.
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
believe
it
was
a
false
alarm
that
we
got
last
night
;
but
I
may
be
wrong
,
and
any
way
we
ought
to
be
cautious
where
Captain
Clavering
’s
liberty
and
life
are
concerned
.
<EOS>
My
notion
is
to
make
pretence
of
quitting
the
house
before
daybreak
,
so
that
if
Increase
Micklegift
,
or
any
other
scoundrelly
spy
like
him
,
should
be
lurking
about
the
premises
—
as
may
be
the
case
,
for
aught
we
can
tell
—
he
may
fancy
the
captain
has
taken
flight
in
reality
.
<EOS>
If
your
honour
thinks
well
of
the
scheme
,
I
’ll
hie
to
the
stables
at
once
,
and
saddle
a
couple
of
horses—”“Thy
stratagem
<EOS>
is
good
,
”
the
colonel
interrupted
;
“
but
I
dare
not
adopt
it
.
<EOS>
My
son
is
too
weak
to
ride
forth
at
this
hour
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
do
n’t
intend
he
should
,
your
honour
,
”
John
Habergeon
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
I
should
be
loth
to
disturb
the
captain
from
such
a
slumber
as
he
hath
not
enjoyed
since
he
quitted
Worcester
;
but
there
is
no
occasion
for
that
.
<EOS>
Martin
Geere
shall
be
the
young
gentleman
’s
representative
,
and
with
one
of
your
honour
’s
cloaks
wrapped
round
him
,
and
one
of
your
honour
’s
hats
upon
his
head
,
Martin
will
play
the
part
indifferent
well
,
especially
as
there
wo
n’t
be
light
enough
to
observe
him
very
narrowly
.
<EOS>
My
object
is
not
merely
to
delude
the
enemy
,
but
to
persuade
the
household
that
Captain
Clavering
is
gone
.
<EOS>
It
is
safest
to
keep
those
talkative
women
-
folk
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
I
can
rely
upon
old
Martin
’s
silence
and
discretion
.
<EOS>
”“Ay
<EOS>
,
I
doubt
not
Martin
may
be
depended
upon
,
”
the
colonel
remarked
.
<EOS>
“
But
whither
will
you
go
?
<EOS>
What
will
you
do
with
the
horses?”“We
<EOS>
sha
n’t
ride
far
,
your
honour
,
”
John
replied
.
<EOS>
“
I
will
make
clatter
enough
before
the
rectory
for
Increase
Micklegift
to
hear
us
,
and
a
word
or
two
roared
out
as
we
pass
will
satisfy
the
rascally
preacher
<EOS>
it
is
no
other
than
Captain
Clavering
whom
I
have
with
me
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
we
will
gallop
off
in
the
direction
of
Brightelmstone
,
and
when
fairly
out
of
hearing
we
will
manage
to
steal
back
,
unobserved
,
over
the
downs
.
<EOS>
”“A
<EOS>
rare
plan
,
i
’
faith
!
”
<EOS>
Colonel
Maunsel
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
“
Thou
hast
a
ready
wit
,
John
.
<EOS>
About
it
at
once
,
and
success
attend
<EOS>
thee!”John
then
departed
on
his
errand
,
and
Colonel
Maunsel
once
more
betook
himself
to
his
son
’s
chamber
.
<EOS>
Clavering
was
still
buried
in
profound
sleep
,
and
while
gazing
on
the
young
man
’s
pale
and
toil
-
worn
features
,
and
thinking
how
necessary
rest
was
to
him
the
colonel
had
scarcely
the
heart
to
deprive
him
of
it
.
<EOS>
So
he
sat
down
by
the
couch
.
<EOS>
How
many
anxious
thoughts
passed
through
the
fond
father
’s
breast
as
he
gazed
upon
his
sleeping
boy
.
<EOS>
Clavering
was
the
only
being
upon
whom
his
affections
were
centred
.
<EOS>
To
lose
him
again
as
soon
as
found
would
be
fearful
indeed
.
<EOS>
So
terrified
was
the
kind
-
hearted
gentleman
by
the
thought
of
such
a
disaster
,
that
he
knelt
down
and
prayed
Heaven
to
avert
it
.
<EOS>
Much
comforted
,
he
arose
and
resumed
his
seat
by
the
bedside
.
<EOS>
Presently
the
sleeper
’s
lips
moved
,
as
if
he
were
essaying
to
speak
,
and
his
sire
,
bending
towards
him
,
heard
him
distinctly
pronounce
the
name
of
Dulcia
.
<EOS>
Slight
as
was
the
circumstance
,
it
confirmed
a
suspicion
which
the
old
Cavalier
had
begun
of
late
to
entertain
,
that
a
mutual
attachment
subsisted
between
the
young
folk
;
and
the
certitude
of
the
fact
was
by
no
means
agreeable
to
him
.
<EOS>
Extremely
partial
to
Dulcia
,
entertaining
,
moreover
,
a
sincere
respect
and
esteem
for
her
worthy
father
,
Colonel
Maunsel
was
yet
a
very
proud
man
,
and
never
contemplating
such
a
union
for
his
son
as
might
here
take
place
,
would
infallibly
have
refused
to
sanction
it
.
<EOS>
However
,
this
was
not
a
moment
wherein
to
trouble
himself
with
so
light
a
matter
—
light
,
at
all
events
,
he
deemed
it
in
comparison
with
the
serious
considerations
before
him
—
so
he
dismissed
the
subject
from
his
mind
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
had
little
time
for
reflection
.
<EOS>
The
hour
had
advanced
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
the
household
would
be
astir
,
and
it
was
needful
to
awaken
Clavering
,
in
pursuance
of
his
plan
.
<EOS>
The
heavy
chains
of
slumber
in
which
the
young
man
was
bound
did
not
yield
to
the
colonel
’s
first
attempt
to
break
them
;
neither
,
on
opening
his
eyes
,
did
Clavering
appear
to
be
conscious
where
he
was
,
nor
who
was
near
him
.
<EOS>
Calling
out
fiercely
that
he
would
never
yield
with
life
to
a
rascally
Roundhead
,
he
commanded
his
father
to
take
his
hands
from
off
him
;
but
immediately
perceiving
his
error
,
he
became
silent
,
while
the
colonel
in
a
few
words
explained
his
intentions
.
<EOS>
On
this
Clavering
arose
,
and
,
attiring
himself
with
his
sire
’s
aid
,
accompanied
the
latter
to
his
chamber
.

IllustrationCHAPTER
IIWhat
Passed
Between
The
Independent
MinisterAnd
Dulcia
<EOS>
In
The
ChurchyardIT
was
now
peep
of
day
.
<EOS>
The
summit
of
the
eastern
downs
glistened
in
the
early
sunbeams
,
though
the
nearer
slopes
still
remained
grey
and
sombre
.
<EOS>
Thinking
that
the
fresh
morning
air
would
revive
him
,
Colonel
Maunsel
drew
aside
the
window
curtains
,
and
throwing
open
the
casement
,
looked
forth
upon
the
garden
.
<EOS>
Animate
nature
was
just
beginning
to
feel
the
quickening
influence
of
the
God
of
Day
.
<EOS>
The
garrulous
occupants
of
the
higher
trees
made
the
welkin
ring
with
their
cawing
as
they
flew
past
in
quest
of
their
morning
meal
;
lesser
birds
twittered
amongst
the
boughs
;
the
mavis
burst
from
the
holm
-
tree
to
dispute
the
first
worm
upon
the
grass
-
plot
with
the
intrusive
starling
;
pigeons
were
circling
around
the
house
,
or
alighting
on
the
roof
;
lowings
of
oxen
and
other
noises
resounded
from
the
farm
-
yard
;
and
the
tinkling
of
the
sheep
-
bell
was
heard
on
the
adjacent
down
,
where
might
be
seen
the
fleecy
company
,
just
released
from
the
fold
,
in
charge
of
the
shepherd
,
and
looking
as
grey
as
the
turf
on
which
they
browsed
.
<EOS>
At
such
an
hour
,
and
on
a
spot
which
ought
to
have
been
sacred
from
intrusion
,
the
presence
of
an
enemy
was
as
unexpected
as
unwelcome
.
<EOS>
Yet
as
the
colonel
’s
eye
wandered
over
the
garden
,
now
resting
upon
one
object
,
now
on
another
,
he
fancied
he
saw
a
dark
figure
pass
quickly
by
an
arched
opening
in
an
avenue
of
clipped
yew
-
trees
.
<EOS>
The
noise
of
stealthy
footsteps
at
the
same
moment
reached
his
ear
,
convincing
him
that
he
was
not
deceived
.
<EOS>
Hastily
withdrawing
from
the
window
,
he
took
up
a
position
enabling
him
to
command
this
portion
of
the
garden
,
while
it
did
not
expose
him
to
observation
.
<EOS>
As
he
thus
watched
,
a
head
was
protruded
from
the
end
of
the
alley
nearest
the
house
,
but
it
was
so
suddenly
withdrawn
that
he
could
not
tell
to
whom
it
belonged
.
<EOS>
After
waiting
for
several
minutes
without
perceiving
anything
further
of
the
owner
of
the
head
,
the
colonel
turned
to
mention
the
circumstance
to
his
son
,
and
then
found
that
Clavering
,
overcome
by
weariness
,
had
thrown
himself
,
dressed
as
he
was
,
upon
the
bed
,
and
was
once
more
wrapped
in
slumber
.
<EOS>
Not
caring
to
wake
him
,
the
brave
old
gentleman
took
up
his
sword
and
was
on
the
point
of
descending
to
the
garden
,
when
a
tap
was
heard
at
the
door
,
and
John
Habergeon
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
On
learning
what
had
occurred
,
John
tarried
not
a
second
,
but
,
flying
down
stairs
,
made
the
best
of
his
way
to
the
yew
-
tree
avenue
;
the
colonel
looking
on
all
the
while
from
the
window
.
<EOS>
John
,
however
,
started
no
spy
from
the
covert
,
and
only
disturbed
a
pair
of
blackbirds
in
his
search
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
he
extended
his
investigations
,
as
far
as
he
judged
prudent
,
in
the
direction
of
the
parsonage
house
,
but
with
an
equally
fruitless
result
,
and
he
was
obliged
to
return
to
his
master
without
any
intelligence
respecting
the
intruder
.
<EOS>
The
old
Cavalier
was
much
troubled
.
<EOS>
That
some
one
had
been
lurking
within
the
garden
<EOS>
he
felt
sure
,
for
he
could
not
doubt
the
evidence
of
his
senses
;
and
that
this
person
came
with
no
friendly
intent
was
equally
manifest
.
<EOS>
Danger
,
therefore
,
was
to
be
apprehended
,
and
must
be
the
more
carefully
guarded
against
,
inasmuch
as
its
designs
were
secret
.
<EOS>
John
then
related
what
he
had
done
.
<EOS>
According
to
his
own
belief
,
his
stratagem
had
been
perfectly
successful
.
<EOS>
Old
Martin
Geere
having
been
disguised
in
the
manner
<EOS>
arranged
,
the
pair
rode
slowly
up
the
hill
-
side
by
the
rectory
,
and
when
close
to
the
house
,
John
halted
for
a
moment
to
vociferate
an
adieu
to
the
Independent
minister
,
and
was
well
pleased
to
hear
a
window
suddenly
opened
,
and
to
perceive
the
reverend
gentleman
with
a
nightcap
on
his
head
,
look
out
at
them
.
<EOS>
Rating
them
for
a
couple
of
drunken
malignants
,
and
declaring
that
Satan
was
at
their
heels
,
and
would
assuredly
trip
them
up
ere
they
had
proceeded
far
on
their
journey
,
Increase
might
have
favoured
them
with
a
still
longer
harangue
,
but
that
John
interrupted
him
with
a
roar
of
derisive
laughter
,
and
pushed
on
after
his
companion
.
<EOS>
John
and
old
Martin
then
crossed
the
hill
,
and
,
shaping
their
course
in
a
northerly
direction
up
the
valley
as
if
bound
for
Falmer
,
got
round
to
the
Rottingdean
road
,
and
so
over
the
down
to
the
little
thicket
at
the
back
of
the
Grange
,
where
Martin
dismounted
,
and
<EOS>
John
,
taking
both
horses
to
the
stables
,
called
up
the
groom
and
his
helpmate
,
leading
them
to
suppose
that
their
young
master
was
gone
.
<EOS>
Not
having
encountered
any
one
during
the
ride
,
John
had
persuaded
himself
that
his
return
to
the
stables
was
unnoticed
,
until
the
incident
in
the
garden
made
him
fear
that
his
supposition
might
not
be
altogether
correct
.
<EOS>
He
now
naturally
enough
concluded
,
that
Increase
Micklegift
,
suspecting
an
attempt
to
dupe
him
,
had
stolen
down
to
the
Grange
to
satisfy
himself
of
the
truth
.
<EOS>
If
so
,
he
could
have
learnt
little
.
<EOS>
The
wary
measures
taken
were
sufficient
to
mislead
him
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
conclusion
arrived
at
both
by
the
colonel
and
John
.
<EOS>
But
they
agreed
,
that
the
utmost
caution
must
be
observed
while
they
were
watched
by
an
enemy
so
wily
as
the
preacher
.
<EOS>
“It
vexes
me
much
to
think
that
I
can
not
send
for
a
surgeon
to
attend
upon
my
son
,
”
the
colonel
said
.
<EOS>
“
There
is
Master
Ingram
of
Lewes
,
a
man
well
skilled
in
his
profession
,
or
Ralph
Hoathleigh
of
Brightelmstone
,
or
even
old
Isaac
Woodruff
of
Rottingdean
—
any
one
of
them
would
do
;
but
I
dare
not
trust
them
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
it
would
excite
suspicion
if
a
surgeon
were
sent
for
.
<EOS>
”“No
<EOS>
need
to
send
for
one
,
your
honour
,
”
the
old
trooper
replied
.
<EOS>
“
The
captain
’s
wounds
are
in
a
fair
way
of
healing
,
and
his
broken
bones
have
already
begun
to
knit
together
.
<EOS>
He
only
wants
rest
and
good
nursing
to
set
him
up
again
,
and
he
is
sure
of
the
latter
,
with
me
and
gentle
Mistress
Dulcia
to
attend
upon
him
.
”“Dulcia
!
”
<EOS>
the
colonel
exclaimed
,
looking
at
him
fixedly
.
<EOS>
“
Why
should
she
come
nigh
him
?
<EOS>
Saidst
thou
not
,
erewhile
,
that
it
would
be
safest
not
to
let
the
women
-
folk
into
the
secret
,
lest
they
should
blab?”“Ay
,
marry
did
I
,
”
John
rejoined
;
“
but
I
did
not
include
Mistress
Dulcia
amongst
the
tattlers
.
<EOS>
Heaven
forbid
!
<EOS>
She
is
discretion
itself
,
and
would
never
breathe
a
word
to
jeopardize
the
captain
.
”“Humph
!
”
<EOS>
the
colonel
ejaculated
.
<EOS>
“
At
all
events
,
she
shall
not
nurse
my
son
.
<EOS>
”“Then
I
wo
n’t
answer
for
his
cure
,
”
John
answered
,
gruffly
.
<EOS>
“Not
<EOS>
so
loud
,
I
prithee
,
John
.
<EOS>
Thou
wilt
awake
him
.
<EOS>
By
Heaven
,
he
opes
his
eyes!”“Then
acquaint
him
with
your
resolve
.
<EOS>
”“What
<EOS>
is’t
,
my
father
?
”
<EOS>
Clavering
cried
,
from
the
couch
.
<EOS>
“His
<EOS>
honour
the
colonel
deems
it
expedient
that
during
your
confinement
to
this
chamber
,
you
should
be
solely
under
my
care
,
captain
;
as
if
you
had
not
had
enough
of
an
old
trooper
’s
rough
nursing
,
and
stood
not
in
need
of
gentler
care
.
<EOS>
”“If
<EOS>
I
am
to
be
deprived
of
Dulcia
’s
society
<EOS>
,
I
will
not
remain
here
,
”
Clavering
exclaimed
,
springing
from
the
couch
.
<EOS>
“I
told
your
honour
how
it
would
be
,
”
John
cried
,
chuckling
.
<EOS>
“Thou
art
in
league
against
me
,
rascal
,
”
the
colonel
ejaculated
,
shaking
his
hand
at
him
.
<EOS>
“
<EOS>
And
as
to
thee
,
Clavering
,
thou
art
a
wilful
and
undutiful
boy
.
<EOS>
A
soldier
should
have
a
soldier
’s
attendance
merely
.
<EOS>
But
since
thou
art
so
weak
and
womanish
that
none
save
Dulcia
will
serve
thy
turn
to
watch
over
thee
and
tend
thee
,
even
be
it
as
thou
wilt
.
<EOS>
”“My
<EOS>
father!—”“Get
well
as
quickly
as
thou
canst
,
that
is
all
I
ask
.
<EOS>
”“Your
honour
hath
ta’en
the
best
way
to
ensure
that
object
,
”
John
observed
.
<EOS>
“Hold
thy
peace
!
”
<EOS>
the
colonel
cried
.
<EOS>
“
Within
yon
closet
thou
wilt
find
all
thou
needest
to
perfect
his
cure
:
unguents
of
great
virtue
,
sovran
balsams
,
cordials
,
and
an
elixir
prepared
for
me
by
my
worthy
friend
Sir
Kenelm
Digby
,
which
ought
to
call
back
the
vital
spark
if
it
were
on
the
eve
of
departure
.
<EOS>
Use
what
thou
wilt
;
but
mark
me
!
<EOS>
if
thy
patient
gets
not
well
speedily
,
I
’ll
send
for
Master
Ingram
.
<EOS>
”“Nay
,
I
shall
be
myself
again
in
less
than
a
week
,
”
Clavering
cried
.
<EOS>
“
I
am
stronger
already
,
and
with
the
prospect
of
such
attendance—”“Peace
,
I
say
!
”
<EOS>
his
father
cried
.
<EOS>
“
I
have
heard
reasons
enow
,
and
have
yielded
against
my
better
judgment
.
<EOS>
Aid
me
to
attire
myself
,
”
he
added
to
John
,
“
and
then
I
will
leave
my
son
master
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
Thou
wilt
have
to
be
groom
of
the
chamber
,
as
well
as
head
-
nurse
,
John
,
<EOS>
for
none
of
the
household
will
come
nigh
ye
,
except
old
Martin
Geere
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
give
me
my
hose
and
doublet
.
<EOS>
”At
<EOS>
a
somewhat
later
hour
in
the
morning
,
though
still
comparatively
early
,
Colonel
Maunsel
was
joined
in
the
library
,
whither
he
had
repaired
on
going
down
stairs
,
by
Mr.
Beard
and
Dulcia
,
both
of
whom
were
under
the
impression
that
Clavering
was
gone
;
and
one
of
them
,
at
least
,
was
much
relieved
by
finding
that
such
was
not
the
case
.
<EOS>
A
bell
having
been
rung
for
prayers
,
the
greater
part
of
the
household
assembled
at
the
summons
,
and
the
clergyman
read
a
portion
of
the
Holy
Scriptures
to
them
;
after
which
he
knelt
down
,
and
the
rest
following
his
example
,
he
offered
up
an
extempore
prayer
for
the
preservation
from
all
danger
of
the
lord
of
the
mansion
and
his
son
.
<EOS>
All
joined
fervently
in
this
supplication
,
but
none
more
so
than
Dulcia
.
<EOS>
Their
devotions
ended
,
the
old
Cavalier
and
his
guests
proceeded
to
the
hall
and
partook
of
breakfast
.
<EOS>
Martin
Geere
was
in
attendance
at
the
meal
,
which
was
of
a
substantial
character
,
according
to
the
habits
of
the
period
,
and
the
colonel
,
when
he
could
do
so
without
observation
,
privily
despatched
him
upstairs
with
a
supply
of
eatables
for
his
son
.
<EOS>
No
mystery
was
made
about
John
Habergeon
,
since
his
return
was
known
to
the
household
,
and
the
old
trooper
could
take
care
of
himself
in
the
buttery
.
<EOS>
Breakfast
over
,
Dulcia
and
her
father
rose
to
depart
,
when
the
colonel
,
calling
the
latter
to
him
,
said
,
in
a
low
tone
,
“
Go
upstairs
,
child
,
to
Clavering
.
<EOS>
Your
society
will
cheer
him
,
and
help
to
while
away
the
tedious
hours
of
his
captivity
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
him
in
my
chamber
with
John
Habergeon
.
<EOS>
Be
cautious
,
and
,
above
all
,
arouse
not
Patty
<EOS>
Whinchat
’s
suspicions
.
<EOS>
”Dulcia
blushingly
withdrew
,
and
Colonel
Maunsel
soon
afterwards
got
up
and
repaired
to
the
library
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Dulcia
having
retired
to
her
own
room
,
was
awaiting
a
favourable
opportunity
to
visit
the
captive
,
when
she
was
interrupted
by
the
sudden
entrance
of
Patty
.
<EOS>
“Oh
!
<EOS>
I
’ve
seen
him
—
<EOS>
I’ve
seen
him
!
”
<EOS>
gasped
the
handmaiden
,
who
looked
pale
and
terrified
.
<EOS>
“Seen
whom
?
”
<EOS>
Dulcia
exclaimed
,
thinking
naturally
of
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“Why
,
Increase
Micklegift
,
to
be
sure
,
madam
.
<EOS>
Who
else
could
frighten
me
so
much
?
<EOS>
I
happened
to
be
in
the
corridor
just
now
,
when
he
came
up
to
me
<EOS>
—
how
he
got
there
<EOS>
I
ca
n’t
<EOS>
tell!—and
seizing
me
rudely
by
the
arm
,
uttered
these
words
in
my
ear
:
‘
Bid
thy
young
mistress
come
to
me
without
delay
.
<EOS>
I
would
speak
to
her
on
a
matter
which
concerns
her
nearly
.
<EOS>
I
will
tarry
for
her
during
the
space
of
one
hour
,
within
the
churchyard
.
<EOS>
If
she
comes
not
within
that
time
,
she
will
ever
hereafter
rue
her
negligence
.
<EOS>
Convey
my
message
to
her
at
once
.
’
<EOS>
And
with
this
he
disappeared
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
,
from
his
looks
,
he
has
some
evil
design
.
<EOS>
You
wo
n’t
go
,
of
course
,
madam?”“Yes
<EOS>
,
I
will
,
Patty
,
”
Dulcia
replied
,
after
a
moment
’s
reflection
.
<EOS>
“
I
have
no
fear
of
him
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
at
once
,
and
you
shall
attend
me
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
important
to
others
to
ascertain
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
Give
me
my
hood
,
child
.
<EOS>
”Approving
of
her
young
mistress
’s
<EOS>
spirit
,
Patty
made
no
further
remonstrance
,
and
Dulcia
having
quickly
attired
herself
for
the
walk
,
the
two
young
women
left
the
room
,
crossed
the
entrance
-
hall
without
stoppage
,
passed
out
at
the
front
porch
,
and
proceeded
towards
the
church
.
<EOS>
As
they
advanced
,
they
saw
the
dark
figure
of
the
Independent
divine
within
the
churchyard
.
<EOS>
Increase
Micklegift
had
an
austere
and
somewhat
ill
-
favoured
countenance
,
but
his
features
,
though
large
and
harsh
,
were
by
no
means
devoid
of
intelligence
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
dark
and
restless
,
and
his
singularly
pale
complexion
contrasted
forcibly
with
his
coal
-
black
hair
,
which
was
cropped
close
as
the
skin
of
a
mole
.
<EOS>
He
was
attired
in
the
garb
of
a
Puritan
preacher
,
and
wore
the
tall
sugar
-
loaf
hat
which
Patty
had
remarked
at
the
window
on
the
previous
night
.
<EOS>
In
age
Micklegift
might
be
about
thirty
,
and
his
person
was
tall
and
thin
,
but
extremely
muscular
.
<EOS>
On
seeing
the
two
damsels
approach
,
he
advanced
slowly
to
meet
them
,
and
making
a
grave
salutation
to
Dulcia
,
said
to
Patty
,
“
Tarry
by
the
gate
,
maiden
,
until
thy
mistress
shall
return
to
thee
.
”He
<EOS>
then
signed
to
Dulcia
to
follow
him
,
and
walked
on
in
silence
until
they
turned
the
angle
of
the
church
,
and
drew
near
the
entrance
-
porch
,
when
he
stood
still
.
<EOS>
Patty
’s
inquisitive
disposition
might
have
led
her
to
creep
stealthily
after
them
,
if
she
had
not
observed
a
man
suddenly
spring
over
the
wall
on
the
north
of
the
churchyard
,
and
make
his
way
cautiously
round
the
tower
of
the
sacred
edifice
.
<EOS>
Patty
suppressed
the
scream
that
rose
to
her
lips
on
discovering
that
this
individual
was
John
Habergeon
.
<EOS>
Having
come
to
a
halt
,
as
related
,
Micklegift
said
,
in
a
supplicatory

a
flush
overspread
his
pale
features
,
“
Hearken
unto
me
,
maiden
.
<EOS>
Ever
since
I
set
eyes
upon
thee
,
my
heart
hath
yearned
towards
thee
.
<EOS>
Thy
charms
have
been
a
snare
unto
me
,
in
which
I
have
fallen
.
<EOS>
Yet
though
I
have
burnt
with
love
for
thee
,
I
have
not
ventured
to
declare
my
passion
,
for
I
have
perceived
that
I
am
an
object
of
aversion
in
thy
sight
.
”“Forbear
<EOS>
this
discourse
,
sir
,
”
Dulcia
cried
,
“
or
you
will
drive
me
away
from
you
instantly
.
”“Despise
<EOS>
me
not
,
but
pity
me
,
maiden
,
”
implored
the
preacher
.
<EOS>
“
My
love
for
thee
is
as
a
tormenting
fire
which
consumes
my
very
vitals
.
<EOS>
It
disorders
my
brain
,
and
drives
me
to
the
verge
of
madness
.
<EOS>
Have
compassion
upon
me
!
<EOS>
I
will
be
thy
slave

<EOS>

thou

<EOS>
”“I
will

Dulcia
said
,
turning
to
depart
.
<EOS>
“You
<EOS>
shall
hear
me
out

”
Micklegift
cried
,
changing
his
tone
to
one
of
menace
,
and
seizing
her
arm
.
<EOS>
“
Love
,
like
mine
,
unrequited

makes
a

desperate

<EOS>
Another

possession

your

but
he
shall
not
be
an
obstacle
in
my

<EOS>
The
malignant
Clavering
Maunsel
is
concealed
in
his
father
’s
house
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
vain
to
attempt
denial
with
me
.
<EOS>
The
life
of
this
traitor
to
the
Commonwealth
is
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
I
can
denounce
him
at
any
moment
,
and
I
will
denounce
him
,
if
you
continue
inflexible
.
”
<EOS>
After
a
moment
’s
pause
,
during
which
he
watched
the
impression
he
had
made
upon
her
,
he
went
on
:
“
Not
only
is
Clavering
Maunsel
’s
life
in
my
power
,
but
a
word
from
me
will
consign
your
father
to
a
prison
,
where
he
may
rot
unheeded

<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
have
you
the
heart
to
act
thus
against
those
who
have
never
offended
you
,
inhuman
man

<EOS>
Have
some
pity
for
them

<EOS>
”“You
have
no

,
damsel
.
<EOS>
You
care
not
how
much
I
suffer
.
<EOS>
Now
hear
my
fixed
determination

<EOS>
Either
consent
to
become
my

I
will
use
the
means
of
vengeance
placed
in

<EOS>
”“Give
<EOS>
me
till
to

morrow
for
consideration
<EOS>
,
”
Dulcia
replied
.
<EOS>
“I
will
grant
the
time
you
require
,
on
your
solemn
promise
that
you
will
neither
give

to
Clavering

<EOS>
”“I
give

she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“Enough

<EOS>
To

morrow
<EOS>
I
shall
expect
your
answer

here

<EOS>
Till
then
,
farewell!”Released
from
his
gripe
,
the
terrified
damsel
instantly
made
her
escape
.
<EOS>
“I
am
bound
by
no

”
muttered
John
Habergeon
,
who
was
ensconced
behind
the
angle
of
the
church

,
and
had
heard
all
that

”CHAPTER

IIISome
Of
The
Vexations
Experienced
By
A
RoyalistGentleman
<EOS>
At
The
Time
Of
The
CommonwealthA
TROUBLESOME
day
was
in
store
for
Colonel
Maunsel
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
the
library
,
seated
in
an
easy
-
chair
,
meditating
upon
the
“
Eikon
Basilike
,
”
when
Martin
Geere
entered
,
and
,
with
a
perturbed
countenance
,
informed
him
that
a
state-
messenger
was
without
,
and
desired
instant
speech
with
him
.
<EOS>
The
visit
boded
the
colonel
no
good
,
but
he
ordered
the
man
to
be
admitted
.
<EOS>
The
messenger
,
however
,
did
not
wait
for
permission
to
present
himself
,
but
followed
close
upon
Martin
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
tall
,
stern
-
looking
man
,
having
the
appearance
of
a
soldier
,
and
carried
a
long
sword
by
his
side
and
a
pair
of
large
pistols
in
his
belt
.
<EOS>
He
made
no
salutation
to
the
colonel
,
neither
did
he
attempt
to
remove
his
broad-
leaved
hat
from
off
his
close
-
cropped
head
.
<EOS>
“What
wouldst
thou
with
me
,
thou
unmannerly
fellow
?
”
<EOS>
the
old
Cavalier
demanded
,
eyeing
him
with
great
displeasure
.
<EOS>
“Thou
hadst
best
show
some
respect
to
my
order
,
though
thou
showest
none
to
me
,
”
the
man
coldly
rejoined
,
taking
a
parchment
from
his
girdle
.
<EOS>
“
Be
it
known
to
thee
,
Wolston
Maunsel
,
somewhile
colonel
in
the
service
of
the
Man
Charles
Stuart
,
that
by
virtue
of
this
order
from
the
Council
of
State
,
thou
art
confined
and
restricted
,
on
pain
of
imprisonment
,
within
a
limit
of
five
miles
of
thine
own
dwelling
.
<EOS>
”“How
?
”
<EOS>
the
colonel
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
“
Confined
within
a
range
of
five
miles!”“The
limit
is
large
enough
for
a
dangerous
and
plotting
malignant
like
thee
,
”
the
messenger
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
See
thou
exceed
it
not
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
yet
more
to
declare
unto
thee
.
<EOS>
Forasmuch
as
thy
son
,
Clavering
Maunsel—”“Ha
!
<EOS>
what
of
him
?
”
<EOS>
the
colonel
cried
,
unable
to
conceal
his
agitation
.
<EOS>
“—being
charged
with
high
treason
against
the
Commonwealth
,
and
a
warrant
having
been
issued
for
his
apprehension
,
in
order
that
he
may
be
brought
before
a
court
-
martial
,
in
virtue
of
a
commission
from
his
Excellency
General
Cromwell
,
this
is
to
give
thee
notice
,
that
if
thou
shalt
harbour
thy
said
son
Clavering
,
or
lend
him
aid
so
that
he
escape
,
and
the
ends
of
justice
be
thereby
defeated
,
thou
thyself
,
and
any
of
thy
house
who
may
act
under
thee
,
will
incur
the
penalties
of
high
treason
.
<EOS>
Thou
art
warned
,
and
a
like
warning
will
be
delivered
to
thy
whole
house
.
<EOS>
”So
<EOS>
saying
,
the
man
strode
towards
the
colonel
,
laid
down
the
parchment
on
the
table
before
him
,
and
,
turning
on
his
heel
,
departed
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Maunsel
remained
for
some
time
,
half
stupefied
,
with
his
gaze
fixed
upon
the
warrant
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
took
it
up
,
and
after
glancing
at
it
,
dashed
it
down
with
a
burst
of
passion
.
<EOS>
His
wrath
,
however
,
gave
way
to
feelings
of
alarm
,
when
he
learnt
from
old
Martin
Geere
that
,
prior
to
his
departure
,
the
state
-
messenger
had
collected
the
household
together
,
and
informed
them
that
if
they
aided
in
concealing
their
young
master
,
now
or
hereafter
,
they
would
be
severely
punished
.
<EOS>
“But
<EOS>
your
honour
need
have
no
fear
,
”
the
faithful
old
fellow
said
.
<EOS>
“
They
all
believe
the
captain
is
gone
;
but
if
they
knew
he
was
hidden
in
the
house
,
they
would
endure
torture
rather
than
betray
him
.
<EOS>
”At
<EOS>
this
juncture
Mr.
Beard
entered
the
library
,
and
learning
what
had
occurred
,
besought
his
patron
not
to
be
cast
down
,
but
to
place
his
reliance
upon
that
Power
which
had
delivered
him
from
so
many
difficulties
and
dangers
.
<EOS>
“It
is
my
son
’s
safety
that
concerns
me
most
,
”
the
old
Cavalier
groaned
.
<EOS>
“
So
he
escape
,
I
care
not
what
becomes
of
me
.
<EOS>
But
,
‘
sdeath
!
”
<EOS>
he
cried
,
breaking
out
into
fresh
fury
.
<EOS>
“
I
should
never
have
desired
to
quit
my
own
domain
,
if
the
tyrannous
Council
had
not
made
me
a
prisoner
.
”He
<EOS>
then
paced
to
and
fro
within
the
room
for
some
minutes
,
exclaiming
,
with
much
bitterness
,
“
By
Heaven
!
<EOS>
it
is
intolerable
to
be
insulted
thus
in
one
’s
own
house
.
<EOS>
O
what
a
land
we
live
in
!
<EOS>
Everything
seems
at
sixes
and
sevens
.
<EOS>
All
honourable
usages
are
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
Respect
for
age
and
station
is
gone
.
<EOS>
Fanaticism
and
hypocrisy
usurp
the
place
of
religion
and
virtue
,
and
he
is
esteemed
the
godliest
man
who
can
dissemble
most
,
and
best
put
on
a
sanctimonious
visage
and
demeanour
.
<EOS>
Out
on
the
pestilent
knaves
who
have
thus
abolished
all
that
was
good
in
the
country
,
and
set
up
all
that
is
bad
—
a
low-
born
crew
who
would
grind
down
all
to
their
own
base
level!”“Yet
there
are
some
good
men
among
them
,
honoured
sir
,
”
Mr.
Beard
observed
,
“
who
have
been
influenced
by
worthy
motives
,
and
by
love
of
their
country
,
in
what
they
have
done
.
<EOS>
”“I
marvel
to
hear
you
say
so
,
sir
,
”
the
old
Cavalier
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
Were
the
motives
worthy
of
those
bloody
butchers
who
slaughtered
their
virtuous
king
?
<EOS>
Are
their
motives
worthy
who
have
overthrown
our
Established
Church
,
and
set
up
the
National
Covenant
in
its
stead
?
<EOS>
Are
their
motives
worthy
who
persecute
and
despoil
,
outrage
and
insult
in
every
way
all
those
who
have
shown
loyalty
and
devotion
to
their
king
,
and
zeal
for
the
country
<EOS>
’s
welfare
?
<EOS>
Out
upon
them
,
I
say!”“I
can
make
every
allowance
for
your
warmth
,
honoured
sir
,
<EOS>
for
you
have
much
to
move
you
to
indignation
,
”
the
good
clergyman
said
;
“
<EOS>
but
I
would
not
have
you
blind
to
the
truth
.
<EOS>
Faults
there
have
been
in
high
places
beyond
doubt
—
<EOS>
grievous
faults
—
else
had
not
those
who
filled
them
been
cast
down
.
<EOS>
Deeply
must
the
princes
and
mighty
ones
of
the
land
have
sinned
,
or
the
Lord
would
not
have
visited
them
so
severely
with
His
displeasure
.
<EOS>
”“You
seem
to
have
caught
the
general
infection
,
sir
,
”
the
old
Cavalier
observed
,
sarcastically
,
“
and
speak
as
by
the
mouth
of
Increase
Micklegift
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
speak
according
to
my
conviction
,
my
honoured
patron
,
<EOS>
and
I
speak
the
more
boldly
,
because
I
am
well
assured
that
it
is
only
by
acknowledgment
of
our
errors
,
and
resolution
of
amendment
for
the
future
,
that
we
can
turn
aside
Heaven
’s
wrath
from
against
us
.
<EOS>
Such
men
as
Cromwell
are
instruments
of
divine
displeasure
.
<EOS>
”“Name
<EOS>
him
not
,
”
cried
the
colonel
,
vehemently
;
“
or
name
him
as
the
arch-
hypocrite
,
the
regicide
and
parricide
that
he
is
.
<EOS>
But
you
are
right
.
<EOS>
We
must
have
deeply
sinned
,
or
we
could
not
have
been
yielded
to
the
dominion
of
such
as
Cromwell
.
<EOS>
O
England
!
<EOS>
when
will
thy
days
of
gloom
be
over?”“When
<EOS>
her
offences
are
expiated
,
”
the
clergyman
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“Merry
<EOS>
England
men
were
wo
nt
to
style
thee
when
I
was
younger
,
”
the
colonel
said
,
in
a
mournful
tone
;
“
but
merry
thou
art
no
longer
.
<EOS>
Melancholy
England
were
nearer
the
mark
;
sour
England
;
distracted
England
;
the
England
of
Noll
Cromwell
and
the
saints

Heaven
defend

and
such

Hearty

joyous

loving

not

<EOS>
Men
smile
no
longer
within
thy
cities

<EOS>
Gaiety
is
punished
as
a
crime
,
and
places
of
pleasant
resort
are
forbidden
to
thy
youth
.
<EOS>
Upon
thy
broad
breast
sits
the
night
-
hag
Puritanism
,
scaring
away
thy
dreams
of
happiness
,
and
filling
thee
with
terrors
.
<EOS>
It
is
ill
with
thee
,
England
.
<EOS>
Wrong
hath
become
right
within
thee
—
loyalty
,
treason
—
religion
,
an
offence
.
<EOS>
Heaven
grant
thee
a
speedy
deliverance
from
the
wretched
thraldom
<EOS>
in
which
thou
art
placed!”“I
do
not
despair
of
England
,
sir
,
”
Mr.
Beard
remarked
.
<EOS>
“Neither
do
I
,
”
the
old
Cavalier
rejoined—“when
Noll
Cromwell
shall
be
overthrown
,
and
the
monarchy
restored
.
<EOS>
But
,
till
that
consummation
arrives
,
I
am
much
tempted
to
exile
myself
from
her
shores
.
”Here
<EOS>
Martin
Geere
presented
himself
again
,
and
with
new
terror
imprinted
upon
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
“What
’s
the
matter
now
?
”
<EOS>
the
colonel
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
“
I
guess
from
thy
looks
that
thou
bring’st
fresh
tidings
of
ill
.
<EOS>
”“I
bring
no
good
news
,
in
sooth
,
”
Martin
replied
.
<EOS>
“
There
are
two
men
without
who
crave
admittance
to
your
honour
—
crave
<EOS>
,
did
I
say?—nay
,
they
insolently
demand
it
.
<EOS>
One
of
them
is
Thomas
Sunne
,
the
Brightelmstone
deputy
of
the
Committee
for
the
Sequestration
of
Livings
.
<EOS>
His
reverence
knows
him—”“Too
well
,
”
Mr.
Beard
observed
.
<EOS>
“The
<EOS>
other
<EOS>
I
take
to
be
a
messenger
,
for
he
hath
a
warrant
,
and
beareth
a
truncheon
of
office
.
<EOS>
”“Ay
<EOS>
,
and
he
will
use
it
on
thy
shoulders
,
sirrah
,
if
he
be
kept
longer
here
,
”
exclaimed
a
peremptory
voice
without
.
<EOS>
And
the
next
moment
two
personages
stepped
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
The
foremost
of
them
,
who
was
he
that
had
spoken
,
was
of
middle
age
,
short
and
stout
,
and
was
somewhat
showily
attired
in
a
blue
doublet
and
scarlet
cloak
;
the
latter
garment
,
however
,
was
weather
-
stained
,
and
had
lost
much
of
its
original
brilliancy
.
<EOS>
His
doublet
was
embroidered
with
the
badge
of
the
Goldsmiths
’
Company
—
a
leopard
’s
head
and
a
covered
cup
.
<EOS>
His
companion
was
an
elderly
man
,
with
a
sour
,
puritanical
countenance
,
clad
in
sad
-
coloured
raiments
,
and
wearing
a
steeple
-
crowned
hat
.
<EOS>
Neither
of
them
uncovered
their
heads
on
entering
the
room
.
<EOS>
“Ahem
!
<EOS>
”
cried
the
foremost
of
the
two
,
clearing
his
throat
to
enable
him
to
speak
more
emphatically
.
<EOS>
“
It
is
Wolston
Maunsel
,
I
surmise
,
before
whom
I
stand?”“Thou
art
in
the
presence
of
Colonel
Maunsel
,
thou
saucy
knave
,
”
the
old
Cavalier
haughtily
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
Who
,
and
what
art
thou?”“I
am
not
bound
to
answer
the
interrogations
of
a
known
malignant
like
thee
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
I
will
tell
thee
that
my
heathenish
name
was
Lawrence
Creek
,
but
since
I
have
put
off
the
old
man
,
I
am
known
as
Better
Late
than
Never
,
a
saintly
designation
,
and
one
becoming
an
elder
,
like
myself
.
<EOS>
I
am
an
emissary
unto
thee
,
O
Wolston
Maunsel
,
from
the
Commissioners
of
Goldsmiths
’
Hall
,
in
Foster
-
lane
,
London
,
to
whom
,
as
thou
knowest
,
thy
forfeiture
to
the
State
hath
been
assigned
,
to
summon
thee
to
appear
before
the
said
commissioners
within
ten
days
to
pay
two
hundred
pounds
for
thy
five
-
and
-
twentieth
part
of
the
fine
which
hath
been
set
upon
thee
.
<EOS>
”“My
<EOS>
fine
hath
been
fully
discharged
,
”
the
colonel
said
.
<EOS>
“
I
have
already
paid
the
commissioners
five
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
”“That
is
no
concern
of
mine
,
”
the
other
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
Thou
must
appear
before
them
to
explain
matters
.
<EOS>
”“A
pest
upon
thee
!
”
<EOS>
the
old
Cavalier
angrily
ejaculated
.
<EOS>
“
Thou
art
enough
to
drive
a
man
distraught
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
stir
hence
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
received
an
order
from
the
Council
prohibiting
me
,
on
pain
of
imprisonment
,
from
going
more
than
five
miles
from
home
.
<EOS>
Here
is
the
warrant
.
<EOS>
Read
it
,
and
satisfy
thyself
.
”“It
<EOS>
is
no
concern
of
mine
,
”
the
emissary
replied
,
declining
to
look
at
the
warrant
.
<EOS>
“
I
shall
leave
the
order
with
thee
.
<EOS>
Neglect
to
obey
it
at
thy
peril
.
<EOS>
”And
,
as
he
spoke
,
he
placed
a
scroll
on
the
table
,
and
drew
back
a
few
paces
,
while
the
second
individual
stepped
forward
.
<EOS>
“My
business
is
with
thee
,
Ardingly
Beard
,
”
this
personage
said
.
<EOS>
“
Thou
knowest
that
I
have
been
appointed
,
together
with
my
colleague
,
Thomas
Geere
of
Ovingdean
,
brother
to
Martin
Geere
,
who
still
continues
in
the
service
of
the
dangerous
malignant
,
Wolston
Maunsel—”“I
am
glad
my
brother
Tom
hath
had
the
grace
not
to
present
himself
before
his
honour
,
”
Martin
remarked
.
<EOS>
“Thomas
Geere
was
once
one
of
my
flock
,
”
Mr.
Beard
observed
,
sadly
.
<EOS>
“He
<EOS>
hath
seen
the
error
of
his
ways
,
”
Sunne
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
But
,
as
I
was
about
to
say
,
thou
knowest
that
he
and
I
have
been
appointed
by
the
Committee
for
the
Sequestration
of
Livings
to
collect
,
gather
,

receive
the
tithes

rents
,

profits
of
the
benefice
of
the
church
of
Ovingdean
,
now
under
sequestration
,
and
to
provide
for
its
care
.
<EOS>
Thou
knowest
also
how
we
have
applied
those
profits
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
have
some
guess
,
”
the
clergyman
observed
.
<EOS>
“
Partly
to
your
own
use
,
partly
in
payment
of
Increase
Micklegift
.
”“Wholly
<EOS>
in
payment
of
that
godly
divine
,
”
Thomas
Sunne
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
Now
give
heed
to
what
I
say
unto
thee
,
Ardingly
Beard
.
<EOS>
It
is
suspected
that
thou
continuest
secretly
to
perform
the
rites
and
services
of
thy
suppressed
church
.
<EOS>
Take
heed
,
therefore
.
<EOS>
If
the
offence
be
proved
against
thee
,
thou
shalt
pay
with
thy
body
for
thy
contumacy

<EOS>
A
year
’s
imprisonment
in
Lewes
Castle
will
teach
thee
submission
.
”“Heaven
<EOS>
grant
thee
a
more
Christian
spirit

”
the
clergyman
meekly
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“Friend

quotha
!
<EOS>
I
am
no
friend
of
prelatists
and
covenant

breakers

the
other
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
Wilt
thou
take
the
National
Covenant?”“Assuredly
not

”
Mr.
Beard
replied
,
firmly
.
<EOS>
“Begone
both
of
ye

”
<EOS>
Colonel
Maunsel
cried
,
losing
all
patience
,
“
and
rid
my
house
of
your
hateful
presence
.
<EOS>
”“You
had
best
lay
hands
upon
us
,
Wolston
Maunsel

”
the
emissary
from
Goldsmiths
’
Hall
cried
,
in
a
taunting
and
insolent
tone
.
<EOS>
“
I
should
like
nothing
better
.
<EOS>
”“Nor
<EOS>
I

”
Thomas
Sunne
added
.
<EOS>
“Be
<EOS>
patient
,
I
implore
of
you

honoured

the
clergyman
cried
,
“
and
let
them
go

<EOS>
”“Show
<EOS>
them
forth
,
Martin

I
shall
do
them
a
mischief

”
the
colonel
cried
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
the
two
men
withdrew
,
muttering
threats
,
however
,
as
they
departed
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
and
Mr.
Beard
were
left
alone
,
Colonel
Maunsel
gave
vent
to
a
fresh
explosion
of
rage
.
<EOS>
“Perdition
seize
these
Roundhead
miscreants
!
”
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
“
They
have
set
me
upon
the
horns
of
a
dilemma
.
<EOS>
How
am
I
to
fulfil
such
contradictory
orders
?
<EOS>
Here
is
one
that
tells
me
I
must
not
stir
from
home
;
another
,
commanding
me
to
come
to
London
.
<EOS>
If
I
obey
one
,
I
must
perforce
neglect
the
other
;
and
,
for
my
own
part
,
I
am
well
disposed
to
pay
respect
to
neither
.
<EOS>
”“I
scarce
know
how
to
counsel
you
,
honoured
sir
,
”
the
clergy
-
man
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
Truly
,
it
is
a
most
embarrassing
position
in
which
you
are
placed
.
”“It
is
more
embarrassing
than
you
deem
,
reverend
sir
,
”
the
colonel
returned
.
<EOS>
“
I
have
not
wherewithal
to
pay
the
fine
imposed
upon
me
,
and
must
borrow
the
two
hundred
pounds
,
at
heavy
usance
,
from
old
Zachary
Trangmar
,
the
money-
lender
of
Lewes
.
<EOS>
”“I
am
grieved
to
hear
it

sir

Mr.
Beard
observed
.
<EOS>
“These
bloodsuckers
will
never
let
me
rest
till
they
have
utterly
ruined
me

”
pursued
the
colonel
;
“
and
such
,
I
doubt
not
,
is
their
intent

<EOS>
Their
aim
is
to
cripple
all
true
men

<EOS>
Heaven
confound
their
devices!”“Amen

<EOS>
the
clergyman
ejaculated
.
<EOS>
“Well
!
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
the
difficulty
must
be
met
,

bravely
too

the
old
Cavalier
cried
—
”
<EOS>
no
tame
yielding
,
or
crying
for
quarter
on
the
part
of
Wolston
Maunsel
.
<EOS>
“
I
will
fight
the
good
fight
,
so
long
as
there
is
breath
in
my
body
.
<EOS>
I
must
go
forthwith
to
Lewes
<EOS>
—
it
is
almost
within
my
prescribed
limits
—
and
see
Zachary
Trangmar
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
to
give
the
extortionate
old
rascal
my
bond
,
for
he
will
not
trust
the
word
of
a
gentleman

<EOS>
”“I
can
not
become
surety
for
you

honoured
sir

the
clergyman
observed
;
“
or
I
would
willingly
be
so
.
<EOS>
”“No
<EOS>
,
no
,
”
Colonel
Maunsel
exclaimed
,
hastily
.
<EOS>
“
The
old
usurer
will
be
content
with
my
own
security
.
<EOS>
Unluckily
,
it
is
not
the
first
transaction
I
have
had
with
him
.
<EOS>
If
the
knaves
go
on
plundering
me
in
this
manner
,
I
shall
have
little
,
beyond
my
good
name
,
to
leave
my
son
.
<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
that
will
be
his
fairest
inheritance
,
sir

”
Mr.
Beard
observed
.
<EOS>
“It
is
not
likely
to
content
him
,
though
,
”
the
colonel
rejoined
,
with
a
half
laugh
.
<EOS>
“
However
,
we
must
hope
for
better
days
,
though
neither
you
nor
I
may
live
to
see
them
,
reverend
sir
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
we
must
provide
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
I
will
ride
to
Lewes
this
morning
,
and
Dulcia
shall
accompany
me
.
<EOS>
John
Habergeon
will
watch
over
Clavering
,

will
know
how
to
act
,
in
case
of
difficulty
.
<EOS>
To
your
charge
,
good
sir
,
I
confide
the
rest
of
the
house
during
my
brief
absence
.
”Mr
.
<EOS>
Beard
bowed
,
and
the
colonel
arose
,
observing
,
that
when
he
last
got
on
horseback
,
his
rheumatism
was
so
bad
,
that
he
thought
he
should
never
more
be
able
to
mount
steed
;
but
he
felt
quite
equal
to
the
effort
now
.
<EOS>
Summoning
Martin
Geere
,
he
bade
him
cause
a
couple
of
horses
to
be
saddled
—
one
of
them
for
Mistress
Dulcia
.
<EOS>
And
seeing
the
old
serving
-
man
stare
at
the
unexpected
order
,
he
added
,
“
The
day
is
fine
,
and
tempts
me
to
take
an
hour
’s
exercise
on
the
downs
.
<EOS>
”“But
<EOS>
your
honour
hath
not
ridden
for
more
than
two
months
,
”
old
Martin
stoutly
objected
.
<EOS>
“No
<EOS>
matter
,
I
mean
to
ride
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
See
that
the
horses
are
got
ready
forthwith
.
<EOS>
”“I
should
not
have
supposed
that
your
honour
would
like
to
leave
the
house
just
now
,
”
Martin
persisted
.
<EOS>
“
How
says
your
reverence
?
<EOS>
When
robbers
are
abroad
,
it
were
well
,
methinks
,
that
the
master
stayed
at
home
to
guard
his
treasure
.
<EOS>
”“My
<EOS>
honoured
friend
has
good
reason
for
what
he
doth
,
”
the
clergyman
replied
;
“
and
I
trust
we
shall
be
able
to
protect
the
house
and
all
within
it
,
during
his
absence

<EOS>
”“Nay
,
then
I
have
nothing
more
to
urge
,
”
the
old
serving
-
man
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“Hark
ye
,
Martin
,
”
the
colonel
cried
,
arresting
him
;
“
bid
Eustace
Saxby

the
falconer

hold
himself
in
readiness

bring
with
him
the
young
Barbary
falcon

merlin

manned

HAWKING
ON
THE
DOWNSCHAPTER
<EOS>
IThe
Ostreger
And
His
SonHORSE
,
hawk
,
and
man
were
at
the
gate
,
awaiting
the
colonel
’s
coming
forth
with
Dulcia
.
<EOS>
Stately
and
upright
sat
the
hawks
on
the
falconer
’s
gloved
fist
,
as
if
conscious
of
their
tufted
hoods
of
crimson
and
white
velvet
,
their
jesses
and
bewets
with
bells
affixed
to
them
,
and
their
silver
-
linked
varvels
,
graven
with
their
owner
’s
armorial
bearings
.
<EOS>
Both
birds
looked
in
fine
condition
:
plumage
glossy
and
unruffled
,
legs
and
talons
without
speck
or
blemish
.
<EOS>
Gallant
to
behold
was
the
Barbary
,
or
tartaret
falcon
;
not
remarkable
in
point
of
size
,
for
it
was
smaller
than
a
tercel
-
gentle
;
but
specially
to
be
admired
for
its
proud
neck
,
broad
breast
,
fine
sails
and
beams
,
and
long
train
;
and
,
when
unhooded
,
for
its
keen
-
bent
beak
,
with
barb
feathers
beneath
the
clap
,
wide
nares
,
and
full
black
eye
.
<EOS>
Fierce
and
courageous
,
also
,
was
the
tartaret
’s
companion
,
the
merlin
;
very
nimble
of
wing
,
and
,
like
the
Barbary
falcon
,
armed
with
strong
singles
and
pounces
.
<EOS>
Eustace
Saxby
,
the
falconer
(
or
ostreger
,
as
he
preferred
to
be
styled
)
,
was
as
gallant
-
looking
as
the
hardy
birds
on
his
fist
.
<EOS>
Clad
in
a
doublet
of
Lincoln-
green
,
with
his
master
’s
arms
embroidered
on
the
shoulder
,
with
his
upper
hose
tied
with
ribbons
at
the
knee
,
and
his
feet
protected
by
stout
leather
buskins
,
he
carried
in
his
right
hand
a
tall
hawking
-
pole
,
and
was
provided
with
a
large
hawking
-
bag
,
containing
coping
-
irons
,
knives
,
scissors
,
creance
,
and
other
implements
of
his
craft
;
together
with
medicines
in
the
shape
of
mummy
-
powder
,
washed
aloes
,
saffron
,
and
casting
.
<EOS>
Eustace
Saxby
was
a
strong
,
well
-
built
man
,
in
the
prime
of
life
,
with
a
hard
but
honest
-
looking
physiognomy
,
of
the
true
Sussex
cast
.
<EOS>
No
Puritan
he
.
<EOS>
Abhorring
a
Roundhead
as
much
as
his
master
,
Eustace
allowed
his
long
locks
to
flow
over
his
shoulders
from
beneath
his
green
velvet
cap
,
to
manifest
his
contempt
of
the
crop
-
eared
curs
.
<EOS>
When
younger
,
our
ostreger
had
been
remarkable
for
activity
,
and
could
then
walk
faster
than
any
man
in
the
county
,
and
keep
up
in
running
with
a
horse
at
full
speed
;
but
having
now
grown
stiffer
in
the
joints
,
he
was
forced
to
cede
the
palm
of
fleetness
to
his
son
,
Ninian
.
<EOS>
Close
to
the
ostreger
stood
his
assistant
,
Barnaby
Lashmere
,
carrying
a
square
wooden
frame
suspended
by
broad
leather
straps
from
his
shoulders
.
<EOS>
On
this
frame
were
perched
several
other
hawks
,
of
various
kinds
,
in
hoods
and
jesses
,
in
readiness
for
the
colonel
,
in
case
he
might
choose
to
take
any
of
them
with
him
.
<EOS>
Ninian
Saxby
,
who
filled
the
post
of
under
-
falconer
,
was
with
his
father
on
the
present
occasion
.
<EOS>
A
very
good
-
looking
young
fellow
of
one
-
and
-
twenty
was
Ninian
,
with
a
fresh
complexion
,
a
merry
blue
eye
,
and
brown
curling
hair
.
<EOS>
His
lithe
figure
and
active
limbs
seemed
made
for
running
and
vaulting
,
and
he
excelled
in
all
manly
sports
.
<EOS>
A
rattling
tongue
had
Ninian
,
as
well
as
a
bright
eye
,
and
his
pleasant
talk
and
winning
smiles
made
him
a
general
favourite
with
the
village
damsels
,
even
with
those
of
a
Puritanical
turn
;
but
his
fondness
for
dancing
and
other
pastimes
,
gaiety
of
manner
,
and
light
discourse
,
frequently
drew
upon
him
the
grave
rebukes
of
the
elders
.
<EOS>
Ninian
,
however
,
cared
little
for
such
censure
.
<EOS>
The
young
falconer
was
too
indiscriminate
in
his
attentions
to
the
damsels
generally
,
and
too
fickle
in
his
regards
,
to
be
assigned
to
any
one
in
particular
;
but
if
he
had
a
preference
,
it
was
supposed
to
be
for
Patty
Whinchat
—
the
pretty
handmaiden
herself
being
decidedly
of
that
opinion
.
<EOS>
Ninian
’s
<EOS>
habiliments
resembled
those
of
his
father
;
his
green
jerkin
was
vastly
becoming
to
him
,
while
his
green
velvet
cap
,
with
a
single
heron
’s
plume
in
it
,
placed
jauntilyon
his
curlyhead
,
suited
well
with
the
handsome
and
somewhat
saucy
features
beneath
it
;
giving
the
wearer
quite
as
much
the
air
of
a
page
as
of
a
falconer
.
<EOS>
Ninian
had
a
bugle
slung
at
his
back
by
a
green
cord
,
a
crossbow
over
his
shoulder
,
and
a
case
of
quarrels
with
a
gaffle
for
bending
the
bow
at
his
hip
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
he
had
two
fine
spaniels
,
coupled
together
,
and
in
leash
,
in
his
charge
.
<EOS>
Falconers
,
hawks
,
dogs
,
horses
,
and
grooms
,
formed
a
picturesque
group
,
viewed
in
combination
with
the
ancient
mansion
,
near
whose
porch
they
were
assembled
.
<EOS>
Amidst
the
group
,
old
Rupert
,
Colonel
Maunsel
’s
favourite
charger
,
and
as
noble
a
piece
of
antiquity
as
the
colonel
himself
,
occupied
a
prominent
place
.
<EOS>
Rupert
’s
best
days
were
long
past
,
it
is
true
—
and
so
,
alas
!
<EOS>
were
his
master’s
—
but
though
there
were
unmistakable
marks
of
age
about
him
,
he
was
a
fine
animal
still
.
<EOS>
There
was
fire
in
his
eye
,
courage
in
his
arching
neck
,
that
told
of
former
mettle
.
<EOS>
Bright
bay
had
been
old
Rupert
’s
colour
,
but
the
hue
was
now
sadly
changed
,
and
the
flanks
were
dull
,
which
had
once
shone
like
satin
.
<EOS>
He
was
furnished
with
a
large
easy
saddle
,
having
a
high
pommel
,
and
a
troussequin
at
the
hinder
bow
.
<EOS>
A
dapple
-
grey
palfrey
,
with
white
mane
and
tail
,
was
destined
for
Dulcia
,
and
this
lively
,
but
well
-
trained
little
animal
,
by
his
pawing
,
champing
,
and
snorting
,
offered
a
strong
contrast
to
the
sedate
deportment
of
the
ancient
charger
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
his
reduced
revenue
,
Colonel
Maunsel
still
managed
to
keep
up
a
large
troop
of
servants
of
one
kind
or
other
.
<EOS>
Born
upon
the
estate
,
most
of
the
members
of
the
old
Cavalier
’s
establishment
were
so
attached
to
him
,
that
they
would
never
have
quitted
his
service
,
except
upon
compulsion
.
<EOS>
Wages
were
with
them
a
minor
consideration
;
one
and
all
expressing
their
readiness
to
share
their
good
old
master
’s
reverses
of
fortune
.
<EOS>
With
the
grooms
and
falconers
awaiting
the
colonel
’s
coming
forth
,
were
gathered
several
others
of
the
household
:
to
wit
,
Giles
Moppett
,
with
a
fat
turnspit
at
his
heels
;
Elias
Crundy
,
the
yeoman
of
the
cellar
,
who
had
brought
out
a
large
black
jack
filled
with
stout
ale
for
the
falconers
;
Holney
Ticeharst
,
the
upper
gardener
,
and
Nut
Springett
,
his
man
,
with
two
or
three
hinds
from
the
farm
-
yard
.
<EOS>
The
unusual
circumstances
of
the
colonel
’s
riding
forth
to
enjoy
the
pastime
of
hawking
would
have
sufficed
to
bring
a
portion
of
the
household
to
the
gate
;
but
there
was
another
motive
for
gathering
together
so
many
of
them
on
the
present
occasion
,
which
might
easily
be
detected
in
the
serious
expression
of
their
countenances
.
<EOS>
The
state
-
messenger
’s
warning
had
struck
terror
into
them
all
.
<EOS>
Not
that
their
fidelity
to
the
colonel
and
his
son
was
shaken
by
it
;
but
knowing
that
Clavering
had
returned
on
the
previous
night
,
they
were
very
apprehensive
for
his
safety
;
for
though
told
that
the
fugitive
had
left
again
before
daybreak
,
few
of
them
credited
the
statement
,
but
felt
convinced
that
he
was
hidden
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
It
was
on
this
alarming
topic
that
they
were
now
conversing
together
.
<EOS>
“Ah
,
well
-
a
-
day
!
<EOS>
these
be
sad
times
indeed
!
”
<EOS>
old
Ticehurst
observed
.
<EOS>
“
Wheresoever
our
young
master
may
be
,
there
I
hope
his
enemies
will
never
find
him
.
<EOS>
Hast
any
news
to
gi
’
us
,
Master
Moppett
?
<EOS>
Thou
be’st
a
scholard
like
his
reverence
,
Master
Beard
,
and
read’st
de
pappers
.
<EOS>
”“I
have
no
news
likely
to
yield
thee
much
satisfaction
,
<EOS>
good
Master
Ticehurst
,
”
Moppett
replied
.
<EOS>
“
I
have
read
both
the
Perfect
Diurnal
and
the
Mercurius
Politicus
,
and
they
are
full
of
nothing
save
the
Lord
General
Cromwell
’s
late
glorious
victory
over
the
Scots
king
(
as
they
term
his
most
sacred
Majesty
)
at
Worcester
;
telling
us
how
old
Noll
returned
to
London
,
and
was
met
by
a
procession
of
the
Men
of
Westminster
,
and
how
he
made
a
triumphal
entry
into
the
City
;
how
great
rejoicings
were
held
,
and
how
the
poor
Scots
prisoners
were
marched
through
the
streets
.
<EOS>
Stay
!
<EOS>
I
have
one
piece
of
news
—
and
sorry
bad
news
<EOS>
it
is
!
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
the
brave
Earl
of
Derby
,
the
Earl
of
Lauderdale
,
and
some
other
Royalists
,
who
fought
at
Worcester
,
have
been
captured
in
Cheshire
,
and
it
is
said
will
all
be
brought
to
the
block
<EOS>
,
Heaven
avert
the
like
fate
from
our
young
master!”“Ay
,
Heaven
avert
it
from
him
,
and
from
one
higher
than
him
,
”
said
Eustace
Saxby
,
in
a
deep
,
earnest
tone
.
<EOS>
“
Canst
give
us
any
tidings
of
the
King
,
Master
Moppett
?
<EOS>
Hath
<EOS>
he
escaped
the
bloodhounds
set
on
his
track
?
<EOS>
‘
<EOS>
Tis
to
be
hoped
he
will
be
watched
over
as
David
was
when
pursued
by
Saul
.
”“There
<EOS>
be
all
sorts
of
rumours
concerning
him
,
”
Moppett
rejoined
;
“
and
right
glad
am
I
that
there
be
so
,
<EOS>
for
their
number
will
serve
to
mislead
his
enemies

<EOS>
Most
likely
his
Majesty
be
hidden
in
some
ellinge
old
house
in
Hampshire
,
waiting
for
a
vessel
to
convey
him
to
France
.
<EOS>
Such
is
the
colonel
’s
opinion
.
<EOS>
”“And
the
colonel
ought
to
know
,
methinks
,
if
any
man
doth
,
”
Elias
Crundy
observed
.
<EOS>
“
But
why
do
n’t
his
Majesty
come
to
the
Grange
?
<EOS>
Our
master
could
soon
hire
him
a
fishing
-
smack
at
New
-
haven
or
Shoreham
to
carry
him
across
the
Channel
.
<EOS>
”“That
<EOS>
’s
more
easily
said
than
done
,
Elias
,
”
Eustace
Saxby
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
No
one
is
allowed
to
embark
at
any
port
along
the
coast
without
special
licence
.
<EOS>
And
as
to
the
Grange
being
a
safe
hiding
-
place
,
I
’m
very
doubtful
about
it
.
<EOS>
Only
yesterday
,
I
heard
from
a
Brightelmstone
Jug
,
whom
I
met
at
Rottingdean
Gap
,
that
a
troop
of
old
Noll
’s
terrible
Ironsides
,
under
Captain
Stelfax
,
have
arrived
at
Lewes
;
and
that
all
houses
in
the
neighbourhood
,
suspected
of
harbouring
fugitive
Royalists
,
are
to
be
strictly
searched
by
‘
em
—
the
Grange
one
of
the
first
.
<EOS>
”“Lord
presarve
us
from
these
ravenous
wolves
and
regicides
!
”
<EOS>
Crundy
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
“
That
be
bad
news
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
But
I
hope
it
ben’t
true
.
<EOS>
”“I’m
<EOS>
afeardt
yo’n
find
it
o’er
true
,
Elias
,
”
Nut
Springett
remarked
,
shaking
his
head
.
<EOS>
“I’ve
<EOS>
heard
John
Habergeon
speak
of
Captain
Stelfax
,
”
Giles
Moppett
said
;
“
and
a
bloody
and
barbarous
rebel
he
must
be
,
from
John
’s
account
.
<EOS>
He
goes
to
work
at
once
with
thumbscrew
and
boot
—
thumbscrew
and
boo
—
<EOS>
d’ye
<EOS>
mind
that
,
my
masters

<EOS>
If
he
comes
here
we
shall
all
be
put
to
the
torture
.
<EOS>
”“And
if
we
be

the
truculent
Roundhead
shall
discover
nothing

”
Eustace
Saxby
cried
,
resolutely
.
<EOS>
“
Let
him
do
his
worst

<EOS>
He
will
learn
what
stuff
a
loyal
Sussex
yeoman
is
made
of

<EOS>
If

Elias

<EOS>
I
would
fain
drink
a
health
,
which
Master
Moppett
tells
me
was
drunk
in
the
dining
-
hall
last
night
—
soon
after
young
master
’s
return
.
”“Drink
<EOS>
it
under
thy
breath
<EOS>
then
,
Eustace
,
”
Moppett
observed
;
“
there
be
spies
about
,
and
no
saying
who
may
overhear
thee
.
<EOS>
”“In
<EOS>
that
case
,
I
’ll
drink
confusion
to
the
king
’s
enemies
!
<EOS>
and
may
his
Majesty
soon
enjoy
his
Own
again
!
”
<EOS>
the
falconer
exclaimed
aloud
,
emptying
the
foaming
horn
offered
him
by
Crundy
.
<EOS>
Ninian
Saxby
took
no
part
in
the
foregoing
discourse
.
<EOS>
After
quaffing
a
horn
of
humming
ale
with
the
rest
,
he
began
to
wind
a
call
upon
his
bugle
that
made
the
walls
of
the
old
house
echo
to
the
cheerful
notes
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
this
might
have
been
intended
as
a
signal
,
for
as
he
sauntered
towards
the
porch
,
who
should
issue
from
it
<EOS>
but
Patty
Whinchat!“Give
you
good
day
,
sweetheart
,
”
<EOS>
quoth
Ninian
,
gallantly
doffing
his
cap
.
<EOS>
“
How
blithe
and
bonny
you
do
look
this
morning
,
fegs
!
<EOS>
Now
for
a
well
-
turned
phrase
to
tickle
her
ears
withal
,
”
he
added
to
himself
.
<EOS>
“
You
look
for
all
the
world
like
a
newly
-
roused
tercel
-
gentle
—
the
tercel
is
the
falcon
’s
mate
,
Patty
,
and
the
falcon
<EOS>
is
a
hawk
for
a
prince
—
when
after
mantling
,
as
we
falconers
term
it
,
she
crosseth
her
wings
over
her
back
,
and
disposeth
herself
to
warble
.
<EOS>
”“To
warble
!
”
<EOS>
the
handmaiden
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
“
Lawk
a

<EOS>
I
never
yet
heard
that
a
hawk
doth
sing

”“Neither

Patty

nevertheless

that
is
to

sitteth
erect

Dost

<EOS>
If

I
will
teach
thee

<EOS>
I

I
know
well
enough

”
she
rejoined
,
“
and
I
would
have
you
know
,
in
return
,
that
I
am
not
to
be
lured
,
like
a
silly
bird
,
by
the
call
of
a
cunning
falconer
,
or
by
the
tinkling
of
silver
bells

<EOS>
If
you
must
whistle

let
it
be
at
Morefruit

I

The

<EOS>
”“You

”“A

she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
Be
serious
for
a
moment
,
if

<EOS>
There
is
something
strange
going
on
in
the
house

<EOS>
I
ca

make
it
out

for
Mistress
Dulcia

<EOS>
”“A

Patty

the
young
falconer
said
,
drawing
closer
to
her
.
<EOS>
“
Is
anybody
hidden
in
the
house?—you
under

eh?”Patty
did
not
trust
herself
to
answer
otherwise
than
by
an
affirmative
nod
.
<EOS>
“Young
master
?
”
<EOS>
Ninian
whispered
.
<EOS>
Another
nod
.
<EOS>
“Your’re
<EOS>
quite
sure
of
it?”Two
more
nods
.
<EOS>
“I
thought
as
much
,
”
Ninian
muttered
.
<EOS>
“
Then
it
behoves
us
all
to
be
upon
the
watch

—
it

behoves
you
to
keep

sir

and
not
to
blab
a

such
importance
to
any
of
the
numerous
maidens
to
whom
you
pay
court
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
do
want
you
to
keep
watch
over
some
one
in
particular

<EOS>
”“Name

is
Increase

<EOS>
May
I
trust
you

Ninian
?
<EOS>
Well
,
then
,
my
young
lady
met
him
this
morning
in
the
churchyard
.
<EOS>
”“Met
Increase
Micklegift
!
<EOS>
whew
!
<EOS>
What
sort
of
‘
lure
’
did
he
use

Patty?—the
whistle
,
or
the
bells
,
eh?”“She
was
seared
by
him
,
rather
than
lured

poor
gentle
dove

<EOS>
the
handmaiden
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“Say
<EOS>
the
word
,
Patty
,
and
a
bolt
from
my
cross

bow
shall
visit
the
canting
preacher

skull
—
<EOS>
smash
it
like
an
addled

<EOS>
It
shall

fegs!”“Killing
him

Mistress
Dulcia

<EOS>
I
’ll
tell
you
what

<EOS>
But
hush
!
<EOS>
they
are
coming
forth
.
<EOS>
More
another
time
.
<EOS>
”So
<EOS>
saying
,
she
hastily
retreated
,
while
Ninian
drew
back
with
equal
celerity
.
<EOS>
A
moment
or
two
afterwards
,
the
stately
figure
of
Colonel
Maunsel
appeared
at
the
doorway
.
<EOS>
The
old
Cavalier
had
offered
his
hand
to
Dulcia
to
lead
her
forth
,
and
was
ceremoniously
preceded
by
Martin
Geere
,
and
followed
by
two
other
serving
-
men
.
<EOS>
But
before
accompanying
them
to
their
horses
,
and
noting
the
effect
produced
by
the
colonel
’s
appearance
on
his
attached
retainers
,
let
us
see
what
had
taken
place
within
the
house
since
we
last
left
it
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IIThe
ProclamationAFTER
giving
directions
to
Martin
Geere
,
as
before
related
,
Colonel
Maunsel
,
attended
by
Mr.
Beard
,
sought
his
son
,
in
order
to
acquaint
him
with
his
meditated
ride
to
Lewes
.
<EOS>
Clavering
’s
disappointment
will
be
readily
conceived
,
on
hearing
that
,
in
consequence
of
this
arrangement
,
he
should
be
deprived
of
Dulcia
’s
society
,
on
which
he
had
fondly
calculated
.
<EOS>
However
,
he
did
not
venture
to
remonstrate
,
but
accepted
,
with
the
best
grace
he
could
,
Mr.
Beard
’s
offer
to
remain
with
him
during
the
colonel
’s
compulsory
absence
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
John
Habergeon
returned
to
his
post
,
which
he
had
temporarily
quitted
,
as
the
reader
is
aware
;
and
the
colonel
briefly
explained
his
plans
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
old
trooper
made
no
objection
,
but
informed
his
master
that
he
had
ascertained
,
beyond
a
doubt
,
that
Increase
Micklegift
had
discovered
that
Captain
Clavering
was
concealed
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
John
did
not
deem
it
needful
to
state
how
he
had
obtained
this
information
,
neither
did
he
declare
what
he
meant
to
do
;
but
he
appeared
so
sanguine
as
to
his
ability
to
baffle
the
enemy
<EOS>
’s
machinations
,
that
he
allayed
the
fears
which
his
intelligence
was
calculated
to
excite
.
<EOS>
As
the
principal
bedroom
in
the
house
,
the
colonel
’s
chamber
was
of
considerable
size
—
it
was
,
in
fact
,
a
double
room
,
for
there
was
an
inner
apartment
,
which
did
not
communicate
with
the
gallery
,
and
the
entrance
to
which
could
be
screened
by
a
thick
arras
curtain
.
<EOS>
Wainscoted
with
lustrous
old
black
oak
,
and
hung
with
faded
tapestry
,
the
larger
room
had
an
extremely
sombre
air
.
<EOS>
In
it
were
one
or
two
closets
,
and
it
was
furnished
with
a
large
oak
armoire
,
half
a
dozen
high
-
backed
chairs
,
and
a
great
elbow
-
chair
,
always
used
by
the
colonel
himself
,
and
placed
near
a
massive
oak
table
,
on
which
were
writing
materials
and
a
few
books
.
<EOS>
In
the
inner
chamber
stood
the
bedstead
,
a
very
antique
piece
of
furniture
,
with
lofty
tester
,
carved
posts
,
and
heavy
hangings
.
<EOS>
His
conference
with
John
Habergeon
finished
,
the
colonel
repaired
to
the
inner
room
.
<EOS>
Opposite
the
bed
stood
a
large
oak
coffer
,
banded
with
iron
.
<EOS>
Unlocking
this
chest
,
after
rummaging
for
a
short
space
amongst
its
contents
,
he
found
the
deed
he
was
looking
for
,
secured
it
about
his
person
,
and
then
summoning
John
to
his
aid
,
proceeded
to
equip
himself
for
the
ride
;
putting
on
a
dark
riding
-
dress
,
with
boots
having
immense
funnel
tops
,
and
large
spurs
.
<EOS>
Mr
.
<EOS>
Beard
,
meantime
,
had
gone
downstairs
to
look
after
his
daughter
,
and
returned
with
her
,
just
as
the
colonel
<EOS>
’s
preparations
were
completed
.
<EOS>
A
green
velvet
robe
,
with
long
skirts
,
ornamented
with
gold
lace
in
front
,
and
a
feathered
hat
,
constituted
Dulcia
’s
riding
apparel
;
and
very
well
it
became
her
.
<EOS>
The
young
damsel
had
been
the
colonel
’s
constant
companion
so
long
as
he
was
able
to
take
horse
exercise
,
and
he
had
bestowed
this
somewhat
showy
dress
upon
her
in
order
to
evince
his
contempt
of
the
primness
and
simplicity
affected
by
the
Puritans
.
<EOS>
Very
little
time
was
allowed
the
young
folk
for
conversation
;
but
even
in
that
brief
interval
,
Clavering
could
perceive
from
Dulcia
’s
manner
that
her
mind
was
troubled
.
<EOS>
To
a
candid
nature
like
hers
it
was
very
painful
to
have
a
secret
from
her
father
;
and
equally
distressing
was
it
to
her
to
think
that
Clavering
should
be
menaced
by
a
danger
of
the
existence
of
which
she
could
not
warn
him
.
<EOS>
Aware
of
the
cause
of
her
anxiety
,
John
Habergeon
sought
an
early
opportunity
of
relieving
it
,
and
while
the
colonel
was
talking
apart
with
Mr.
Beard
,
the
old
trooper
approached
her
,
and
whispered
,
“
Be
not
uneasy
,
my
dear
young
lady
.
<EOS>
I
overheard
what
passed
in
the
churchyard
.
<EOS>
No
harm
shall
befall
his
reverence
or
Captain
Clavering
.
<EOS>
Trust
to
me
.
<EOS>
”These
<EOS>
words
produced
an
instantaneous
change
in
Dulcia
’s
spirits
,
and
the
few
minutes
more
allowed
to
the
young
people
ere
the
colonel
went
downstairs
,
were
far
more
agreeably
spent
than
those
which
had
preceded
them
.
<EOS>
Every
head
was
uncovered
as
the
colonel
and
his
fair
companion
issued
forth
,
and
old
Rupert
,
recognizing
his
master
’s
voice
and
footstep
,
pricked
his
ears
,
and
neighed
a
welcome
.
<EOS>
Raising
his
black
Spanish
hat
,
looped
at
the
side
,
and
ornamented
with
a
sable
ostrich
plume
,
in
return
for
the
salutations
of
his
dependents
,
the
old
Cavalier
paused
for
a
moment
to
look
round
,
still
retaining
Dulcia
’s
hand
within
his
own
.
<EOS>
Though
he
appeared
thin
and
careworn
,
all
his
retainers
were
struck
by
his
unwonted
activity
,
for
he
did
not
seem
to
need
the
support
of
his
crutch
-
handled
stick
,
or
even
of
Dulcia
’s
arm
.
<EOS>
After
exchanging
a
few
words
with
Eustace
Saxby
,
who
advanced
to
receive
his
instructions
,
the
colonel
assisted
Dulcia
to
her
saddle
,
and
then
prepared
to
mount
Rupert
.
<EOS>
On
being
brought
up
to
his
master
,
the
old
charger
manifested
his
delight
by
whinnying
softly
,
and
thrust
his
nose
into
the
colonel
’s
hands
,
as
the
latter
patted
him
kindly
.
<EOS>
The
moment
was
now
come
when
the
old
Cavalier
’s
new
-
born
activity
was
to
be
more
sharply
tested
than
it
had
hitherto
been
.
<EOS>
When
he
placed
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
and
attempted
to
mount
,
the
effort
wrung
a
groan
from
him
,
and
it
required
the
strong
arm
of
the
groom
to
lift
him
upon
Rupert
’s
back
.
<EOS>
Hawking
not
being
the
real
business
that
the
colonel
had
in
hand
,
he
dispensed
with
the
attendance
of
Barnaby
Lashmere
and
the
supplementary
hawks
,
contenting
himself
with
the
birds
which
the
ostreger
had
upon
his
fist
.
<EOS>
The
party
then
set
forth
in
gallant
style
,
but
had
scarcely
issued
from
the
gate
,
when
they
came
to
a
sudden
halt
.
<EOS>
On
gaining
the
road
,
it
was
noticed
for
the
first
time
by
all
,
that
a
board
had
been
hung
against
the
trunk
of
a
large
tree
which
grew
by
the
gate
.
<EOS>
On
this
board
,
evidently
designed
for
the
purpose
,
was
pasted
a
Proclamation
,
from
the
Council
of
State
,
for
the
Discovery
and
Apprehension
of
Charles
Stuart
,
his
Adherents
and
Abettors
.
<EOS>
A
Reward
of
1000l
.
<EOS>
was
offered
to
whomsoever
should
apprehend
the
said
Charles
Stuart
:
while
penalties
of
High
Treason
were
menaced
against
all
who
should
harbour
him
,
or
aid
him
to
escape
.
<EOS>
Proportionate
rewards
were
offered
for
the
apprehension
of
Charles
Stuart
’s
adherents
,
with
penalties
of
fine
and
imprisonment
for
concealing
them
,
or
lending
them
assistance
.
<EOS>
Strict
commands
were
given
,
in
conclusion
,
to
all
officers
of
Port
Towns
,
and
others
in
authority
,
to
permit
no
person
to
pass
beyond
Sea
without
special
licence
.
<EOS>
After
perusing
the
proclamation
,
the
colonel
demanded
,
in
a
furious
voice
,
who
had
dared
to
put
it
<EOS>
up?An
answer
came
from
an
unexpected
quarter
.
<EOS>
Some
half
-
dozen
individuals
,
who
had
been
standing
behind
another
large
tree
at
a
short
distance
from
the
first
,
now
came
forward
,
and
one
of
them
detaching
himself
from
the
rest
,
marched
towards
the
colonel
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
state
-
messenger
,
with
whom
the
old
Cavalier
had
parleyed
that
morning
.
<EOS>
“Thou
askest
by
whom
that
proclamation
touching
the
apprehension
of
the
Man
Charles
Stuart
hath
been
set
up
,
”
the
messenger
said
.
<EOS>
“
Know
,
Wolston
Maunsel
,
that
it
was
I
,
Nehemiah
Lift
-
up
-
hand
,
who
placed
it
on
the
tree
growing
at
thy
gate
.
<EOS>
I
did
so
at
the
bidding
of
Hezron
Stelfax
,
Captain
of
the
Lord
-
General
Cromwell
’s
own
chosen
troop
of
Ironsides
;
the
said
valiant
and
God
-
fearing
captain
being
now
at
Lewes
.
<EOS>
”“Pluck
<EOS>
it
down
,
some
of
ye
,
and
hew
it
in
pieces
,
”
the
colonel
ejaculated
,
wrathfully
.
<EOS>
“Let
<EOS>
any
man
remove
it
on
peril
of
his
life
,
”
Nehemiah
cried
,
taking
a
pistol
from
his
belt
.
<EOS>
“
I
have
placed
the
mandate
before
thy
dwelling
,
thou
son
of
Belial
,
and
there
it
shall
remain
.
<EOS>
”As
<EOS>
the
words
were
uttered
,
the
persons
by
whom
the
messenger
was
attended
came
up
,
and
proved
to
be
the
emissary
from
Goldsmiths
’
Hall
,
Thomas
Sunne
,
Thomas
Geere
,
and
Increase
Micklegift
.
<EOS>
The
Independent
minister
,
however
,
kept
a
little
in
the
rear
of
the
others
.
<EOS>
“Do
as
I
bid
ye
!
<EOS>
On
your
fealty
to
me
—
on
your
allegiance
to
the
king
—
I
charge
you
pluck
down
that
proclamation
,
”
the
colonel
vociferated
.
<EOS>
But
no
one
stirred
.
<EOS>
“Thy
servants
owe
no
allegiance
to
the
son
of
the
man
who
caused
Israel
to
sin
,
”
Nehemiah
rejoined
,
“
and
who
provoked
the
Lord
God
of
Israel
to
anger
by
his
vanities
.
<EOS>
Even
as
Elah
,
the
son
of
Baasha
,
was
slain
by
Zimri
,
captain
of
the
chariots
,
so
shall
Charles
,
the
son
of
Charles
,
perish
by
the
hand
of
the
great
captain
of
our
new
Israel
.
<EOS>
”“Take
<EOS>
heed
lest
an
Omri
arise
to
depose
thy
murderous
and
rebellious
leader
,
”
the
colonel
retorted
,
carried
away
by
passion
,
“
and
cause
him
to
burn
the
king
<EOS>
’s
house
over
him
,
so
that
he
perish
by
fire
,
like
Zimri
.
<EOS>
Since
none
of
you
will
pluck
down
that
insolent
placard
,
I
will
do
so
myself
.
<EOS>
”Ere
<EOS>
he
could
execute
his
rash
purpose
,
however
,
the
twang
of
a
bow
was
heard
,
a
quarrel
whistled
past
,
and
plunged
deeply
into
the
bark
of
the
tree
,
severing
the
cord
by
which
the
board
was
hung
to
a
small
branch
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
,
the
proclamation
instantly
dropped
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
A
loud
burst
of
laughter
from
his
companions
followed
this
proof
of
Ninian
’s
skill
in
the
management
of
the
cross
-
bow
.
<EOS>
But
the
young
falconer
took
instantly
to
his
heels
;
probably
thereby
escaping
the
vengeance
of
Nehemiah
,
who
,
on
discovering
the
author
of
the
mischief
,
discharged
his
pistol
at
him
,
but
without
effect
.
<EOS>
The
report
of
the
pistol
,
echoing
loudly
through
the
valley
,
brought
several
other
persons
to
the
scene
of
action
.
<EOS>
Menacing
cries
arose
at
the
same
time
from
the
colonel
’s
attendants
,
amongst
whom
were
Eustace
Saxby
,
Martin
Geere
,
Giles
Moppett
,
old
Ticehurst
,
Elias
Crundy
,
and
the
rest
of
our
acquaintances
,
who
had
accompanied
their
master
to
the
gate
.
<EOS>
But
the
most
formidable
demonstration
was
made
by
Ninian
,
who
,
having
fled
to
the
farmyard
,
presently
returned
at
the
head
of
a
posse
of
rustics
,
armed
with
flails
,
pitchforks
,
and
bills
.
<EOS>
These
sturdy
fellows
,
as
they
rushed
up
,
surrounded
Colonel
Maunsel
and
Dulcia
,
like
a
bodyguard
,
uttering
fearful
threats
against
the
Roundheads
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
Nehemiah
and
his
party
had
been
materially
reinforced
,
and
maintained
their
ground
resolutely
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
was
the
pistol
fired
by
the
state-
messenger
,
than
,
apprehensive
of
mischief
,
Thomas
Geere
hurried
off
to
all
such
cottages
as
were
tenanted
by
Puritans
,
and
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
collected
together
some
dozen
or
fourteen
hinds
,
armed
much
in
the
same
manner
as
Ninian
’s
companions
.
<EOS>
Chief
amongst
these
upholders
of
the
authority
of
the
Rump
Parliament
was
Morefruit
Stone
,
a
fanatic
of
such
a
morose
-
looking
and
ill-
favoured
aspect
,
that
if
his
daughter
Temperance
had
borne
any
resemblance
to
him
,
it
is
not
likely
she
would
ever
have
caused
Patty
Whinchat
a
moment
’s
jealous
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
A
conflict
seemed
imminent
;
and
if
it
took
place
,
the
passions
of
the
men
on
both
sides
being
fully
roused
,
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
consequences
would
be
disastrous
.
<EOS>
It
was
this
feeling
that
prevented
the
colonel
from
allowing
his
men
to
make
an
attack
upon
their
opponents
.
<EOS>
Taking
up
a
position
by
the
side
of
his
father
,
Ninian
began
deliberately
to
bend
his
cross
-
bow
with
the
gaffle
,
muttering
to
himself
,
as
he
did
so,“‘Twere
a
pity
to
lose
a
chance
like
this
.
<EOS>
If
I
happen
to
hit
yon
psalm-
singing
rook
,
‘
twill
be
a
good
riddance
,
and
little
harm
done
,
fegs!”Unconscious
of
his
danger
,
the
Independent
divine
seemed
anxiously
bent
upon
preventing
a
collision
between
the
opposing
parties
.
<EOS>
Addressing
himself
to
the
Puritanical
cottagers
,
over
whom
,
as
their
minister
,
he
naturally
exercised
great
control
,
and
specially
to
Morefruit
Stone
,
as
an
elder
,
he
enjoined
them
not
to
strike
a
blow
unless
they
themselves
were
stricken
;
and
his
pacific
efforts
were
seconded
by
Thomas
Sunne
,
who
seemed
to
labour
under
great
alarm
.
<EOS>
Having
succeeded
in
keeping
the
members
of
his
flock
quiet
,
Micklegift
next
addressed
himself
to
Nehemiah
,
who
boldly
confronted
the
colonel
and
his
clamorous
attendants
.
<EOS>
The
state
-
messenger
had
not
budged
an
inch
,
but
having
drawn
a
second
pistol
from
his
belt
,
held
it
in
readiness
.
<EOS>
“Put
up
<EOS>
thy
weapon
,
Nehemiah
<EOS>
,
”
Micklegift
said
to
him
,
“
and
cut
not
off
any
of
these
malignants
in
their
sin
.
<EOS>
Leave
them
time
for
repentance
and
amendment
.
<EOS>
Perchance
,
they
may
yet
be
gathered
into
the
fold
.
<EOS>
”“How
sayst
thou
?
”
<EOS>
Nehemiah
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
“
Wouldst
have
me
allow
the
proclamation
of
the
Parliament
,
whose
officer
I
am
,
to
be
cast
down
and
trampled
under
foot
?
<EOS>
Wouldst
have
me
tamely
stand
by
,
and
hear
his
Excellency
the
Lord
-
General
Cromwell
insulted
by
yon
contumacious
malignant
?
<EOS>
As
spake
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun—‘O
Lord
,
what
shall
I
say
,
when
Israel
turneth
their
backs
before
their
enemies?’—what
shall
I
say
unto
the
captain
of
our
second
Joshua
when
his
mandates
have
been
set
at
nought
.
<EOS>
Interpose
not
between
me
and
these
men
of
Ai
.
<EOS>
”“I
say
unto
thee
again
,
put
up
thy
weapon
,
Nehemiah
,
”
the
Independent
minister
rejoined
;
“
for
if
thou
take
the
life
of
this
man
,
or
the
life
of
any
of
his
followers
,
thou
shalt
not
be
justified
.
<EOS>
Make
not
of
this
peaceful
dene
a
second
Valley
of
Achor
.
<EOS>
”Then
<EOS>
seeing
Colonel
Maunsel
draw
his
sword
,
as
if
about
to
lead
his
men
to
the
attack
,
he
stepped
fearlessly
towards
him
,
and
taking
hold
of
his
bridle
,
besought
him
to
desist
.
<EOS>
“Who
art
thou
who
wouldst
stay
me
?
”
<EOS>
Colonel
Maunsel
cried
,
feigning
not
to
recognize
him
.
<EOS>
“Thy
friend
,
if
thou
wilt
let
me
be
so
,
”
Micklegift
rejoined
,
in
a
pacific
tone
,
“
who
would
fain
save
thee
from
the
peril
into
which
thou
art
about
to
rush
.
<EOS>
Have
respect
,
I
pray
thee
,
for
lawful
and
constituted
authority
.
<EOS>
Join
thy
entreaties
to
mine
,
damsel
,
”
he
added
to
Dulcia
,
seeing
that
the
colonel
paid
little
heed
to
him
,
“
and
prevail
upon
this
hot
-
headed
gentleman
not
to
bring
certain
destruction
upon
himself
and
others
.
<EOS>
”There
was
a
certain
significance
in
Micklegift
’s
tone
that
,
even
in
that
moment
,
did
not
escape
Dulcia
,
and
she
at
once
comprehended
the
jeopardy
in
which
the
infuriated
old
Cavalier
<EOS>
’s
rashness
might
place
Clavering
and
her
father
.
<EOS>
She
therefore
implored
the
colonel
not
to
engage
in
actual
strife
with
the
Parliamentary
officer
and
his
supporters
.
<EOS>
“I
shall
not
come
to
blows
with
them
till
you
are
out
of
harm
<EOS>
’s
way
,
rest
assured
,
girl
,
”
the
old
Cavalier
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“Disperse
your
followers
,
Colonel
Maunsel
<EOS>
,
”
Micklegift
continued
,
in
a
low
tone
,
“
and
I
will
answer
for
it
that
the
matter
shall
be
amicably
adjusted
.
<EOS>
Believe
me
,
I
counsel
for
the
best
.
”“Indeed
<EOS>
he
does
,
”
Dulcia
cried
.
<EOS>
“
In
this
instance
,
at
all
events
,
”
she
added
.
<EOS>
“What
!
<EOS>
dost
thou
,
too
,
side
with
Puritans
and
rebels
,
girl
?
”
<EOS>
the
colonel
cried
.
<EOS>
“
Well
,
I
own
I
have
been
over
hasty
,
”
he
continued
,
returning
his
sword
to
the
scabbard
;
“
yet
the
knave
gave
me
great
provocation
.
”
<EOS>
Then
turning
to
his
followers
,
he
said
,
“
I
thank
you
,
good
fellows
,
for
this
display
of
your
attachment
,
but
I
will
not
put
it
to
further
proof
.
<EOS>
Return
to
your
occupations
,
all
of
you
—
except
Eustace
Saxby
.
<EOS>
”Upon
<EOS>
this
,
the
throng
around
him
moved
off
,
though
reluctantly
,
and
with
very
dissatisfied
looks
;
many
of
them
turning
round
as
they
went
to
shake
their
fists
at
the
Roundheads
,
or
make
other
gestures
of
defiance
.
<EOS>
Observing
Ninian
linger
behind
,
the
colonel
motioned
him
to
depart
.
<EOS>
“Must
<EOS>
I
go
too
,
your
honour
?
”
<EOS>
the
young
falconer
asked
.
<EOS>
“Of
<EOS>
a
certainty
,
”
the
old
Cavalier
answered
.
<EOS>
“
Yon
pestilent
varlet
will
be
sure
to
take
exception
to
thee
.
<EOS>
”“Here
<EOS>
’s
wishing
your
honour
and
Mistress
Dulcia
a
pleasant
morning
’s
pastime
,
then
<EOS>
,
”
Ninian
said
,
doffing
his
cap
,
“
though
it
hath
begun
badly
,
fegs
!
<EOS>
Take
the
spaniels
,
father
.
<EOS>
I
’ll
go
round
by
the
shaw
,
”
he
whispered
,
“
and
join
you
by
the
nearest
burgh
on
the
downs
.
<EOS>
The
rook
hath
‘
scaped
me
now
,
”
he
muttered
,
eyeing
Micklegift
askance
,
as
he
went
away
;
“
but
though
I
have
missed
this
chance
,
I
may
find
another
.
<EOS>
”Meanwhile
,
at
the
exhortation
of
Micklegift
,
Morefruit
Stone
and
the
rest
of
the
sanctimonious
flock
had
likewise
returned
to
their
labour
.
<EOS>
“Peace
is
restored
,
”
Micklegift
said
to
the
colonel
.
<EOS>
“
Proceed
on
thy
way
.
”“Hold
!
”
<EOS>
Nehemiah
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
“
I
will
not
shut
mine
ears
to
the
voice
of
a
Minister
of
the
Word
,
and
since
thou
desirest
peace
,
peace
there
shall
be
.
<EOS>
Yet
ere
<EOS>
I
suffer
this
dangerous
malignant
to
pass
,
I
must
know
his
errand
.
<EOS>
He
is
placed
under
restraint
by
the
Council
,
and
may
not
go
beyond
a
limit
of
five
miles
.
<EOS>
”“You
hear
what
the
man
in
authority
saith
,
”
Micklegift
cried
,
addressing
the
colonel
.
<EOS>
“
Satisfy
him
,
I
pray
you
.
<EOS>
”“My
<EOS>
errand
is
apparent
,
”
the
old
Cavalier
rejoined
,
chafing
at
the
interruption
.
<EOS>
“
I
am
not
as
yet
a
prisoner
in
my
own
house
,
and
am
about
to
enjoy
the
pastime
of
hawking
upon
yonder
downs
.
<EOS>
”“So
<EOS>
thou
sayest
,
”
Nehemiah
rejoined
;
“
but
I
have
been
too
often
deluded
by
those
of
thy
dissembling
party
to
trust
thee
without
some
pledge
of
thy
sincerity
.
”“Ha
!
<EOS>
dost
dare
to
doubt
me
,
fellow
?
”
<EOS>
the
colonel
cried
.
<EOS>
“Hinder
him
not
,
”
Micklegift
interposed
.
<EOS>
“
I
will
be
his
surety
.
<EOS>
”“Thou
!
”
<EOS>
Nehemiah
exclaimed
,
in
astonishment
,
while
the
colonel
himself
looked
equally
surprised
.
<EOS>
“Even
I
,
one
of
the
elect
,
”
the
minister
replied
.
<EOS>
“
Let
him
pass
freely
.
<EOS>
These
worthy
persons
,
”
he
added
,
in
a
lower
tone
to
the
colonel
,
glancing
at
the
same
time
at
Dulcia
,
“
tarry
with
me
till
to
-
morrow
,
and
much
vexation
and
trouble
may
be
spared
thee
by
discreet
behaviour
towards
them
.
”To
<EOS>
this
speech
the
colonel
vouchsafed
no
reply
,
but
rode
slowly
past
Nehemiah
and
the
emissary
from
Goldsmiths
’
Hall
,
who
stood
beside
him
,
followed
by
the
elder
Saxby
with
the
hawks
and
spaniels
.
<EOS>
As
Dulcia
went
by
,
the
Independent
minister
drew
near
her
,
and
regarding
her
fixedly
,
said
in
a
low
tone
,
“
I
shall
expect
thy
answer
to

morrow

damsel

”IllustrationCHAPTER
<EOS>
IIIThe
Tartaret
<EOS>
And
The
HeronAFTER
<EOS>
this
somewhat
inauspicious
commencement
of
his
ride
,
Colonel
Maunsel
,
with
Dulcia
and
Eustace
Saxby
,
turned
off
on
the
right
,
and
mounting
a
steep
road
cut
in
the
chalk
,
which
skirted
the
garden
-
wall
,
soon
gained
the
charming
down
at
the
rear
of
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
The
day
was
delightful
.
<EOS>
A
pleasant
breeze
,
fresh
but
not
too
strong
,
and
redolent
of
the
sea
,
came
from
the
south
-
west
.
<EOS>
Fleecy
clouds
swept
rapidly
overhead
,
their
shadows
flitting
across
the
downs
in
the
direction
which
the
party
were
about
to
take
.
<EOS>
So
invigorating
was
the
breeze
—
so
beautiful
the
prospect
—
so
calm
and
gentle
the
aspect
of
all
nature
—
that
the
colonel
,
though
worn
-
out
by
long
watching
,
fatigue
of
body
,
and
great
mental
anxiety
—
exasperated
,
moreover
,
by
the
insults
he
had
recently
endured
—
soon
experienced
the
kindly
influence
of
the
scene
,
felt
his
chest
dilate
,
and
his
spirits
revive
.
<EOS>
At
no
point
,
as
we
have
elsewhere
remarked
,
are
the
downs
more
beautiful
than
here
.
<EOS>
Our
old
Cavalier
had
a
great
love
for
the
eminence
on
which
he
now
found
himself
.
<EOS>
In
moments
of
impatience
he
talked
of
exiling
himself
from
the
rebellious
land
of
his
birth
,
but
he
would
have
been
miserable
if
he
had
carried
his
threat
into
execution
.
<EOS>
His
severe
rheumatic
attacks
having
confined
him
of
late
altogether
to
the
house
and
garden
,
summer
had
gone
by
,
and
he
had
not
once
visited
his
favourite
downs
.
<EOS>
It
was
therefore
,
with
redoubled
delight
that
he
found
himself
,
after
so
long
an
absence
,
once
more
upon
their
breezy
heights
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
as
if
he
would
never
tire
with
gazing
at
the
prospect
around
him
.
<EOS>
Familiar
as
it
was
,
if
he
had
looked
upon
it
for
the
first
time
it
could
not
have
charmed
him
more
.
<EOS>
Crossing
the
brow
of
the
hill
,
the
party
reached
the
brim
of
a
steep
escarpment
dipping
into
a
beautifully
hollowed
combe
;
and
here
the
colonel
came
to
a
momentary
halt
.
<EOS>
The
sides
of
this
hollow
,
smooth
as
if
scooped
out
by
art
,
were
covered
with
a
carpet
of
the
richest
turf
.
<EOS>
Here
and
there
,
a
little
rounded
prominence
,
or
gentle
depression
,
heightened
their
charm
,
as
a
mole
or
a
dimple
may
lend
piquancy
to
the
cheek
of
beauty
.
<EOS>
A
delightful
air
of
solitude
reigned
over
this
fairy
dell
,
which
well
deserves
its
present
designation
of
the
Happy
Valley
.
<EOS>
On
the
right
of
the
combe
,
near
a
circular
excavation
filled
with
water
for
sheep
,
grew
a
grove
of
trees
of
considerable
size
,
with
a
thicket
beyond
them
.
<EOS>
The
sides
of
the
down
,
which
hemmed
in
the
valley
on
the
opposite
side
,
were
by
no
means
<EOS>
so
steep
as
those
of
the
escarpment
,
and
had
a
warm
brown
tint
,
being
clothed
with
gorse
and
heather
.
<EOS>
Through
the
midst
of
the
combe
wound
a
road
leading
from
Rottingdean
to
Lewes
,
and
looking
over
the
shoulder
of
the
hill
on
the
right
,
could
be
discerned
the
old
church
and
clustered
houses
of
the
former
place
.
<EOS>
While
contemplating
this
beautiful
combe
,
the
colonel
fell
into
a
reverie
,
which
Dulcia
did
not
care
to
disturb
,
and
Eustace
Saxby
remained
at
a
little
distance
behind
them
.
<EOS>
The
silence
,
therefore
,
was
unbroken
,
until
a
blithe
voice
was
heard
singing:‘In
my
conceit
,
no
pleasure
like
to
hawking
there
can
be
:
The
tongue
it
lures
,
the
legs
they
leap
,
the
eye
beholds
the
glee;No
idle
thought
can
harbour
well
within
the
falconer
’s
brain
,
or
though
his
sports
right
pleasant
be
,
yet
are
they
mixed
with
pain
.
<EOS>
He
lures
,
<EOS>
he
leaps
,
he
calls
,
he
cries
,
<EOS>
he
joys
,
<EOS>
he
waxeth
sad
,
And
frames
his
mood
,
according
as
his
hawk
doth
ill
or
bad
.
”“Ah
<EOS>
!
<EOS>
art
there
,
Ninian
?
”
<EOS>
the
colonel
exclaimed
,
as
,
recognizing
the
voice
of
the
singer
,
he
looked
back
and
perceived
the
young
falconer
descending
the
slope
towards
them
.
<EOS>
“
I
ought
to
chide
thee
for
disobeying
orders
.
<EOS>
But
i
’
faith
!
<EOS>
I
am
not
sorry
thou
hast
come
after
us
.
<EOS>
”Ninian
,
who
had
disencumbered
himself
of
his
cross
-
bow
,
and
brought
a
hawking-
pole
with
him
instead
,
laughed
cheerily
,
and
went
on
with
his
song:“At
cockpit
some
their
pleasures
place
to
wager
health
away
,
Where
falconers
only
force
the
fields
to
hear
the
spaniels
bay
.
<EOS>
What
greater
glee
can
man
desire
,
than
by
his
cunning
skill
,
So
to
reclaim
a
haggard
hawk
,
as
she
the
fowl
shall
kill;To
make
and
man
her
in
such
sort
,
as
tossing
out
a
train
,
<EOS>
Or
but
the
lure
,
when
she
’s
at
large
,
to
whoop
her
back
<EOS>
again?”“Well
sung
,
<EOS>
i
’
faith
,
lad
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
colonel
,
as
Ninian
drew
near
him
.
<EOS>
“
There
is
good
sense
in
thy
ballad
.
”“It
is
written
by
old
Geordie
Turbervile
,
”
Ninian
replied
.
<EOS>
“
There
is
more
of
it
,
if
your
honour
and
Mistress
Dulcia
have
patience
to
listen
.
”
<EOS>
And
he
struck
up
again:“When
hawks
are
hurt
and
bruis’d
by
rash
encounter
in
the
skies
,
What
better
skill
than
for
their
harms
a
powder
to
devise
,
To
dry
the
blood
within
the
bulk
,
and
make
the
mummy
<EOS>
soAs
<EOS>

and

With

,
to
make

<EOS>
,
Believe
me
is
no

But
meet
for
civil

courtly
men
that
are

.
<EOS>
”“A
good
song
,
and
well
trolled
,
”
cried
the
colonel
.
<EOS>
“
But
let
us
set
forward
.
<EOS>
”Taking
their
way
over
several
gentle
undulations
,
covered
with
the
softest
sward
,
and
still
keeping
on
the
uplands
<EOS>
,
the
party
,
ere
long
,
approached
a
large
barn
,
in
front
of
which
was
a
stubble
-
field
,
and
here
,
as
a
covey
of
partridges
was
pretty
sure
,
to
be
found
the
spaniels
were
uncoupled
,
and
set
free
by
Niniang
while
the
colonel
took
the
merlin
from
the
elder
Saxby
,
and
began
to
unstrike
her
hood
.
<EOS>
After
ranging
for
a
while
within
the
new
-
shorn
field
,
bounding
from
ridge
to
ridge
,
and
leaving
scarce
an
inch
of
ground
untried
,
the
dogs
became
suddenly
motionless
,
and
Eustace
Saxby
,
who
,
with
his
son
,
had
followed
them
cautiously
,
now
gave
a
sign
to
his
master
,
by
raising
his
hand
,
that
the
partridges
were
found
.
<EOS>
The
colonel
then
advanced
,
and
when
within
a
short
distance
of
the
falconers
,
unhooded
the
merlin
,
and
cast
her
from
his
fist
,
crying
out
,
“
Hey
,
gar
!
gar
!
”
<EOS>
No
sooner
was
the
merlin
upon
the
wing
,
than
,
urged
by
Eustace
,
the
spaniels
rushed
in
and
sprung
the
partridges
.
<EOS>
After
them
darted
the
hawk
,
while
the
terrified
birds
,
instantly
perceiving
their
danger
,
strove
to
escape
by
rapid
flight
—
vainly
strove
,
as
it
turned
out
,
for
with
marvellous
quickness
two
of
their
number
were
stricken
to
the
ground
by
the
merlin
,
and
almost
as
quickly
retrieved
by
the
spaniels
,
who
,
guided
and
incited
by
the
cries
of
the
falconers
,
followed
the
flight
of
the
hawk
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
and
while
the
partridges
,
scattered
in
their
terror
,
were
still
upon
the
wing
,
the
Barbary
falcon
,
which
had
been
committed
to
Dulcia
,
was
unhooded
by
her
and
cast
off
,
and
with
inconceivable
swiftness
joined
her
companion
in
the
chase
.
<EOS>
All
was
now
animation
and
excitement
,
the
falconers
shouting
and
encouraging
dogs
and
hawks
,
and
loudly
applauding
every
successful
stroke
of
the
latter
,
the
colonel
riding
after
them
shouting
likewise
,
and
closely
attended
by
Dulcia
.
<EOS>
Being
very
fleet
of
wing
and
keen
of
beak
,
the
tartaret
did
terrible
execution
.
<EOS>
Such
of
the
scared
and
bewildered
partridges
as
escaped
from
the
merlin
fell
beneath
his
gripping
talons
,
and
almost
in
as
brief
space
as
we
have
taken
to
recount
the
occurrence
,
was
the
whole
covey
struck
to
the
ground
,
and
retrieved
by
the
spaniels
.
<EOS>
The
hawks
were
then
lured
back
by
the
falconers
,
and
bountifully
rewarded
for
their
pains
by
gorges
of
the
prey
—
the
elder
Saxby
making
for
them
what
is
called
the
Italian
soppa
.
<EOS>
The
partridges
having
been
counted
,
and
tied
together
by
Ninian
,
were
given
by
him
to
a
shepherd
lad
,
who
had
joined
them
,
to
convey
to
the
Grange
.
<EOS>
So
excited
had
Colonel
Maunsel
been
by
the
pastime
,
that
for
the
moment
he
quite
forgot
his
troubles
,
and
it
was
with
improved
spirits
that
he
once
more
set
forward
on
his
way
;
shaping
his
course
in
a
north
-
easterly
direction
over
the
downs
,
chatting
pleasantly
with
Dulcia
as
he
went
,
and
now
and
then
addressing
a
word
to
the
falconers
,
who
kept
close
beside
him
.
<EOS>
He
resisted
,
however
,
all
their
attempts
to
induce
him
to
flee
the
hawks
again
;
declining
to
enter
a
holt
,
wherein
Ninian
told
him
there
was
a
nye
of
pheasants
;
and
paying
no
attention
to
Eustace
,
when
the
latter
pointed
out
a
reedy
pond
in
a
hollow
,
where
he
would
be
sure
to
find
wild
-
fowl
—
a
spring
of
teals
,
or
a
covert
of
coots
.
<EOS>
Neither
would
he
permit
a
cast
of
the
merlin
at
what
the
young
falconer
styled
a
“
congregation
”
of
starlings
.
<EOS>
Proceeding
in
this
way
at
an
easy
pace
—
now
descending
into
a
broad
valley
—
now
mounting
another
heather
-
clad
down
—
anon
passing
over
an
elevated
platform
covered
with
fine
green
turf
,
on
which
he
encountered
a
large
square
encampment
,
the
colonel
reached
the
summit
of
Kingston
Hill
,
where
a
magnificent
view
burst
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Almost
at
his
feet
,
as
it
seemed
—
though
,
in
reality
,
three
or
four
miles
off
—
lay
the
ancient
and
picturesque
town
of
Lewes
.
<EOS>
A
very
striking
object
is
Lewes
,
as
viewed
from
this
lofty
eminence
;
but
,
striking
as
it
is
,
it
constitutes
only
a
small
portion
of
the
vast
and
extraordinary
picture
presented
to
the
looker
-
on
—
a
picture
so
vast
,
indeed
,
that
it
can
not
be
taken
in
at
a
glance
,
but
must
be
regarded
from
the
right
,
and
from
the
left
.
<EOS>
Surrounded
by
an
amphitheatre
of
lofty
hills
,
and
planted
upon
a
protruded
town
,
rising
amid
the
Levels
,
the
old
town
occupies
a
singularly
commanding
position
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
it
,
reared
upon
a
high
mound
,
so
as
to
dominate
the
surrounding
structures
,
stands
its
proud
Norman
castle
,
with
its
grey
gateway
,
ivied
towers
,
and
keep
.
<EOS>
Many
churches
and
venerable
edifices
are
there
in
the
quaint
old
town
—
many
large
gardens
and
fine
trees
—
and
most
noticeable
of
all
,
the
picturesque
ruins
of
its
reverend
priory
.
<EOS>
Beneath
Kingston
Hill
lie
the
broad
Lewes
Levels
,
a
large
alluvial
plain
,
through
which
the
narrow
and
meandering
Ouse
flows
towards
the
sea
,
to
find
an
embouchure
at
Newhaven
.
<EOS>
At
the
southern
extremity
of
the
valley
is
Newhaven
itself
,
with
the
bold
promontory
called
the
Castle
Hill
overlooking
its
harbour
.
<EOS>
Opposite
,
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
wide
plain
,
is
the
majestic
Mount
Caburn
,
the
southern
point
of
the
Cliffe
range
of
hills
,
Firle
Beacon
,
and
Malling
Hill
,
with
its
sheer
white
cliff
,
at
the
back
of
Lewes
.
<EOS>
Towards
the
north
-
east
the
eye
ranges
over
a
vast
woody
tract
,
comprising
a
great
portion
of
the
Weald
of
Sussex
,
but
known
in
the
days
of
Roman
subjugation
as
the
Anderida
Sylva
,
in
the
days
of
the
Saxons
as
the
Andredswald
,
and
during
the
Heptarchy
as
the
Royal
Chase
.
<EOS>
Inward
,
the
view
extends
as
far
as
Crow
-
borough
and
the
Reigate
Hills
—
a
range
of
nigh
forty
miles
.
<EOS>
To
the
west
of
Lewes
,
and
commanding
the
Weald
,
is
the
monarch
of
the
South
Downs
,
Mount
Harry
,
so
designated
after
the
famous
battle
fought
upon
its
sides
wherein
Harry
the
Third
was
worsted
by
Simon
de
Montfort
and
the
Barons
.
<EOS>
While
the
colonel
gazed
delightedly
upon
this
immense
panorama
,
Ninian
,
whose
quick
eye
was
sweeping
the
horizon
in
search
of
some
bird
upon
which
to
exercise
the
prowess
of
the
Barbary
falcon
,
perceived
a
heron
,
probably
from
the
heronry
in
Angmering
Park
,
sailing
slowly
towards
them
,
in
the
direction
of
the
marshy
flats
near
Newhaven
,
and
he
instantly
called
his
master
’s
attention
to
the
stately
bird
.
<EOS>
The
old
Cavalier
hesitated
for
a
moment
,
thinking
the
tartaret
too
small
to
make
a
flight
at
a
heron
,
but
being
assured
on
this
score
by
Eustace
,
he
assented
.
<EOS>
When
the
heron
,
who
came
slowly
on
,
with
wide
wings
expanded
,
and
long
neck
and
bill
stretched
out
,
had
drawn
sufficiently
near
,
as
the
colonel
judged
,
he
took
off
the
tartaret
’s
hood
,
and
dismissed
her
,
shouting
out
,
as
before
,
“
Hey
,
gar
!
gar
!
”
<EOS>
while
the
falconers
also
encouraged
her
by
their
cries
.
<EOS>
Startled
by
these
noises
,
and
at
the
same
moment
perceiving
her
enemy
,
the
heron
instantly
quickened
her
flight
.
<EOS>
Swift
as
an
arrow
from
a
bow
,
the
brave
little
tartaret
climbed
towards
her
quarry
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
fine
sight
to
watch
her
mount
,
and
strive
to
overtop
the
heron
,
who
now
,
fully
comprehending
her
danger
,
soared
upwards
likewise
,
till
well
-
nigh
lost
to
view
.
<EOS>
Both
birds
now
looked
like
specks
as
their
movements
were
watched
by
the
group
below
.
<EOS>
Ninian
,
who
had
the
quickest
and
best
eye
of
the
party
,
and
who
had
never
lost
sight
of
the
birds
,
told
them
at
last
,
with
great
exultation
,
that
the
tartaret
had
made
her
mountée
and
got
above
the
heron
.
<EOS>
On
hearing
this
,
the
colonel
uttered
an
exclamation
of
delight
,
as
did
the
elder
Saxby
.
<EOS>
Hoping
to
avoid
the
hawk
’s
fatal
stoop
,
the
heron
now
descended
as
rapidly
as
she
had
previously
soared
aloft
—
the
tartaret
coming
after
her
with
equal
quickness
.
<EOS>
The
crisis
of
the
struggle
was
now
at
hand
,
as
the
watchers
well
knew
,
and
they
looked
on
with
increased
anxiety
.
<EOS>
All
at
once
the
heron
turned
over
on
her
back
,
with
her
long
,
sharp
beak
pointed
upwards
,
like
a
lance
,
to
impale
her
foe
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
the
tartaret
made
her
stoop
,
and
dropped
like
a
stone
upon
her
quarry
,
seizing
her
and
binding
her
.
<EOS>
Both
birds
then
fell
together
,
and
reached
the
ground
at
the
foot
of
the
precipitous
descent
,
down
which
Ninian
ran
with
great
swiftness
,
hoping
to
be
in
time
to
rescue
the
hawk
.
<EOS>
But
ere
he
got
up
all
<EOS>
was
over
with
the
brave
little
tartaret
.
<EOS>
The
heron
’s
bill
had
transfixed
her
when
she
made
her
stoop
,
and
the
gallant
bird
was
dead
ere
touching
the
ground
.
<EOS>
The
hawk
and
her
quarry
were
lying
together
.
<EOS>
The
heron
was
still
alive
,
but
grievously
wounded
,
and
Ninian
at
once
despatched
her
.

CHAPTER
IVCaptain
<EOS>
Stelfax“ALACK
!
<EOS>
alack
!
<EOS>
my
pretty
tartaret
,
thou
art
beyond
the
aid
of
mummy
-
powder
,
”
Ninian
exclaimed
,
as
having
liberated
the
yet
warm
body
of
the
falcon
from
the
cruel
bill
of
its
adversary
,
he
was
smoothing
the
blood
-
stained
mails
on
its
breast
.
<EOS>
“
A
lusty
,
<EOS>
roystering
hawk
thou
wert
,
and
sore
grieved
am
I
to
lose
thee!”He
might
have
gone
on
bemoaning
his
favourite
for
some
while
longer
,
had
not
the
trampling
of
horses
suddenly
roused
him
.
<EOS>
Looking
in
the
direction
whence
the
sound
proceeded
<EOS>
,
he
perceived
a
small
body
of
troopers
advancing
towards
him
at
a
rapid
trot
along
the
road
leading
from
the
adjacent
village
of
Kingston
to
Iford
and
Rodmill
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
these
men
must
belong
to
the
Parliamentary
army
,
for
since
the
rout
at
Worcester
not
a
dozen
Royalist
soldiers
,
horse
or
foot
,
could
have
been
got
together
.
<EOS>
The
little
band
numbered
twenty
men
,
and
with
them
was
an
officer
.
<EOS>
Having
heard
from
his
father
that
a
detachment
of
Cromwell
’s
Ironsides
had
just
arrived
at
Lewes
,
Ninian
rightly
divined
that
these
men
must
belong
to
that
invincible
troop
.
<EOS>
Their
leader
,
in
fact
,
was
no
other
than
the
dreaded
Captain
Stelfax
.
<EOS>
Not
liking
to
hurry
off
,
the
young
falconer
judged
it
best
to
remain
where
he
was
until
the
troop
should
pass
by
.
<EOS>
They
were
now
within
bow
-
shot
of
him
,
and
he
could
discern
that
they
were
all
powerful
-
looking
men
,
well
-
mounted
,
well-
accoutred
,
and
apparently
well
-
deserving
the
hardy
name
they
had
acquired
.
<EOS>
Their
doublets
and
saddle
-
cloths
were
of
scarlet
,
the
original
bright
hue
of
which
had
suffered
from
exposure
to
weather
,
and
service
in
the
field
;
but
their
steel
breastplates
,
tassets
,
and
head
-
pieces
,
were
highly
polished
,
and
gleamed
brightly
in
the
sunshine
.
<EOS>
Each
trooper
had
bandoleers
over
his
shoulder
,
with
powder
-
flask
and
bullet
-
bag
attached
to
the
broad
leathern
belt
;
and
bore
a
long
sword
at
his
side
,
and
a
carabine
slung
from
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
marked
distinction
between
the
leader
of
the
troop
and
those
under
his
command
,
except
that
the
helmet
and
corslet
of
the
latter
were
filigrained
,
and
in
lieu
of
bandoleers
he
had
a
crimson
sash
fringed
with
gold
across
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
At
his
side
he
carried
a
long
Toledo
sword
.
<EOS>
Captain
Stelfax
was
a
man
of
middle
size
,
heavily
built
,
square
set
,
and
very
muscular
,
and
endowed
with
such
prodigious
strength
of
arm
,
that
,
like
a
knight
of
old
,
he
could
cleave
a
foeman
to
the
chine
.
<EOS>
Captain
Stelfax
was
not
thought
to
be
so
rigorous
an
ascetic
as
the
elders
of
his
troop
might
have
desired
,
but
being
a
thoroughly
brave
soldier
,
and
of
tried
fidelity
to
the
cause
,
his
failings
were
regarded
with
a
lenient
eye
.
<EOS>
Though
ferocious
in
the
field
,
and
merciless
,
it
was
said
,
in
his
treatment
of
those
who
came
within
his
grasp
,
his
expression
,
on
the
whole
,
was
good
-
humoured
,
and
his
features
handsome
,
though
rather
coarse
.
<EOS>
His
hair
was
cropped
short
,
but
he
wore
a
bushy
red
beard
,
the
glowing
hue
of
which
put
to
shame
the
tarnished
splendour
of
his
scarlet
doublet
.
<EOS>
A
weighty
man
,
like
this
captain
of
Ironsides
,
required
a
strong
horse
to
carry
him
,
and
he
rode
a
great
sorrel
charger
,
who
seemed
quite
equal
to
his
burden
.
<EOS>
Captain
Stelfax
,
it
presently
appeared
,
had
descried
the
party
on
Kingston
Hill
,
and
,
curious
to
know
who
they
were
,
on
coming
near
Ninian
,
halted
his
men
,
and
shouted
to
the
young
falconer
to
come
to
him
.
<EOS>
Ninian
did
not
dare
to
disobey
,
and
though
he
would
much
rather
have
taken
to
his
heels
,
he
affected
great
alacrity
in
complying
with
the
summons
.
<EOS>
Captain
Stelfax
put
a
few
interrogatories
to
him
in
a
brief
authoritative
tone
,
and
appeared
satisfied
with
the
replies
he
received
;
but
as
soon
as
he
ascertained
that
it
was
Colonel
Maunsel
who
was
on
the
heights
,
he
turned
to
one
of
the
troopers
nearest
him
,
whom
he
addressed
as
Sergeant
Hadadezer
Delves
,
and
,
pointing
out
the
party
stationed
on
the
hill
,
bade
him
bring
them
down
to
him
.
<EOS>
Sergeant
Delves
executed
his
commission
with
great
promptitude
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
precipitous
nature
of
the
ascent
,
he
very
soon
gained
the
summit
of
the
hill
,
and
presenting
himself
before
Colonel
Maunsel
,
delivered
his
leader
’s
message
to
him
.
<EOS>
Knowing
that
refusal
was
impossible
,
the
old
Cavalier
expressed
his
readiness
to
accompany
the
sergeant
—
the
more
so
,
he
said
,
as
he
was
actually
intending
to
proceed
in
that
direction
—
and
only
stipulated
that
he
and
the
young
lady
might
be
allowed
to
descend
at
a
point
where
the
declivity
was
less
abrupt
.
<EOS>
To
this
the
sergeant
made
no
objection
,
and
a
bridle
-
road
being
indicated
by
Eustace
Saxby
,
the
whole
party
soon
afterwards
reached
the
valley
without
misadventure
.
<EOS>
Captain
Stelfax
made
no
advance
to
meet
the
colonel
,
but
remained
lolling
back
listlessly
in
his
saddle
,
with
his
left
hand
on
the
hinder
bow
,
while
the
greater
part
of
his
men
having
lighted
their
pipes
,
puffed
away
at
them
vigorously
.
<EOS>
On
approaching
the
Roundhead
troop
,
Colonel
Maunsel
haughtily
demanded
of
the
officer
wherefore
he
had
been
sent
for?Without
<EOS>
changing
his
position
,
or
making
him
any
reply
,
the
captain
of
the
Ironsides
regarded
him
insolently
for
a
moment
,
and
then
casting
his
eye
upon
Dulcia
,
appeared
much
struck
with
her
charms
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
care
to
conceal
his
admiration
,
but
gazed
at
her
with
much
boldness
.
<EOS>
“Is
<EOS>
this
comely
damsel
your
daughter
,
Colonel
Maunsel
?
”
<EOS>
he
inquired
.
<EOS>
Offended
by
the
question
,
as
well
as
by
the
other
’s
deportment
,
the
old
Cavalier
felt
disinclined
to
answer
.
<EOS>
Putting
a
constraint
upon
himself
,
however
,
he
rejoined
coldly
,
“
She
is
the
daughter
of
the
Rector
of
Ovingdean
,
who
has
been
deprived
of
his
benefice
,
and
who
resides
with
me
.
”“Ardingly
<EOS>
Beard
,
is
he
not
named
?
”
<EOS>
the
other
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
I
have
him
upon
my
list
of
suspected
.
<EOS>
And
his
daughter
is
called
Dulcia
.
<EOS>
I
like
not
the
name
.
<EOS>
It
is
heathenish
,
and
beseemeth
not
one
so
richly
endowed
with
good
gifts
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
avert
not
your
face
from
me
,
damsel
.
<EOS>
A
rough
soldier
’s
talk
need
not
offend
you
.
<EOS>
Perchance
you
have
heard
of
Hezron
Stelfax
,
captain
of
the
Lord
-
General
’s
chosen
troop
of
Ironsides
?
<EOS>
I
am
he
.
<EOS>
”“Ask
me
not
,
then
,
<EOS>
what
I
have
heard
of
you
,
sir
,
”
Dulcia
replied
,
sharply
,
“
or
I
may
be
forced
to
utter
that
which
will
not
sound
pleasing
in
your
ear
.
<EOS>
”“You
can
say
naught
that
will
be
displeasing
to
me
,
I
am
well
assured
,
”
he
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
But
what
have
you
heard
of
me
?
<EOS>
Speak
out
,
and
fear
not
.
<EOS>
”“I
have
heard
that
your
whole
troop
are
cruel
and
blood
-
thirsty
,
”
she
replied
;
“
and
that
you
are
the
cruelest
among
them

”“Ho

<EOS>
ho
!
”
<EOS>
Stelfax
laughed
.
<EOS>
“
Cavaliers

tales

believe
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
cruel
only
to
my
foes
—
bloodthirsty
only
in
the
field
.
<EOS>
And
so
is
every
soldier
,
malignant
as
well
as
Parliamentarian
.
<EOS>
But
since
you
reside
with
Colonel
Maunsel
,
damsel
,
you
must
have
known
his
son
,
Clavering?”Dulcia
made
no
reply
,
but
her
check
burnt
hotly
.
<EOS>
“What
of
him
?
”
demanded
the
colonel
,
who
had
with
difficulty
controlled
his
anger
during
this
discourse
.
<EOS>
“Have
<EOS>
you
not
heard
?
”
<EOS>
the
other
said
,
looking
at
him
steadfastly
.
<EOS>
“Heard
<EOS>
what
?
”
<EOS>
the
colonel
cried
.
<EOS>
“Your
son
fought
at
Worcester
,
”
Stelfax
rejoined
;
“
on
that
great
day
when
the
Lord
of
Hosts
so
wonderfully
manifested
his
power
,
covering
our
heads
in
the
conflict
,
and
enabling
us
utterly
to
overthrow
our
enemies
.
<EOS>
Praise
and
glory
to
His
holy
name
for
the
great
success
given
us
.
‘
<EOS>
Thou
didst
march
through
the

in
indignation

<EOS>
Thou
didst
thrash
the
heathen
in
anger

<EOS>
Thou
wentest
forth
for
the
salvation
of
thy
people
;
thou
woundedst
the
head
out
of
the
house
of
the
wicked
.
<EOS>
’”“It
is
not
your
intention
,
I
presume
,
Captain
Stelfax
,
to
hold
forth
to
me
like
a
preacher
at
a
conventicle
,
”
the
old
Cavalier
observed
,
contemptuously
.
<EOS>
“
What
have
you
to
tell
me
concerning
my
son?”“I
do
not
desire
to
give
you
needless
pain

”
Stelfax
.
<EOS>
“
But
it
is
plain
you
have
not
received
intelligence
of
your

’s
fate

<EOS>
Learn
,
then
,
that
he
was
amongst
the
slain
at
Worcester
.
<EOS>
”“My
<EOS>
son
amongst
the
slain

”
<EOS>
the
colonel
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
“His
<EOS>
body
was
found
,
recognized
,
and
buried
on
the
field

”
Stelfax
returned
.
<EOS>
“
But
you
need
not
repine
.
<EOS>
Many
an
adherent
of
the
Man
Charles
Stuart
suffered
greater
loss
on
that
day
—
glorious
to
us
,
if
disastrous
to
your

.
<EOS>
Neither
need
you
grieve
,
fair
damsel
,
for
this
poor
youth
,
”
he
added
to
Dulcia
,
“
A
better
man
may
be
found
to
supply
his
place
.
<EOS>
”“Were
<EOS>
he

his

never

”
<EOS>
Dulcia
murmured
.
<EOS>
“Colonel
Maunsel
,
”
Stelfax
now
said
to
the
old
Cavalier
,
“
I
sent
for
you
to
give
you
a
warning

<EOS>
You

<EOS>
the
colonel
cried
.
<EOS>
“Take

Charles

<EOS>
Take
heed
you
aid
him
not
so

”
Stelfax
said
,
sternly
,
“
<EOS>
or
you
will
find
little
mercy
from
your
judges

<EOS>
”“I
expect
none
,
”
the
colonel
rejoined—“neither
mercy
nor
justice
.
<EOS>
Have
you
done
,
sir?”“For
<EOS>
the
present
—
yes
,
”
Stelfax
rejoined
.
”
<EOS>
Yet
hold
!
<EOS>
It
is
part
of
my
duty
,
Colonel
Maunsel
,
to
make
a
strict
inquisition
of
your

—
Ovingdean
Grange

I

to
ascertain

<EOS>
Should

you

<EOS>
And
now
,
my

sweet
Dulcia

<EOS>
We
shall
soon
meet
again

”
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
departed
with
his
troop
towards
Iford
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Maunsel
rode
on
in
silence
and
great
anxiety
towards
Kingston
,
until
the
Parliamentary
leader
and
his
men
had
disappeared
from
view
.
<EOS>
He
then
said
to
the
younger
Saxby
,
“
Thou
art
swift
of
foot
,
Ninian
.
<EOS>
Dost
think
that
thou
canst
reach
the
Grange
before
yon
redcoats?”“Ay
,
marry
can
I
,
”
the
young
falconer
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“Off
with
thee
,
then
,
”
the
colonel
cried
.
<EOS>
“
On
the
instant
of
thine
arrival
,
seek
out
John
Habergeon
—
thou
wilt
find
him
in
my
chamber
—
and
acquaint
him
with
the
intended
visit
of
this
rebel
captain

<EOS>
Say
to
him
—
and
say
to
the
whole

—
that
my

reputed
to
have
been
slain
at
Worcester
—
<EOS>
dost
understand?”“Perfectly

your

”
Ninian
replied
.
<EOS>
And
mounting
Kingston
Hill
with
the
lightness
and
swiftness
of
a
deer
,
he
ran
across
the
summit
,
and
then
dashed
down
on
the
further
side
of
the
eminence
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Colonel
Maunsel
and
Dulcia
,
attended
by
Eustace
Saxby

rode
on

THE

IRONSIDESCHAPTER
<EOS>
IThe
Priory
RuinsAPPROACHING
Lewes
by
the
picturesque
suburb
of
Southover
,
the
little
party
halted
near
the
ruins
of
the
once
magnificent
priory
of
Saint
Pancrace
.
<EOS>
Here
,
quitting
the
road
,
the
colonel
and
Dulcia
,
followed
by
the
ostreger
,
with
the
merlin
on
his
fist
and
the
spaniels
at
his
heels
,
entered
a
smooth
,
green
area
,
of
several
acres
in
extent
,
surrounded
by
crumbling
walls
and
arches
,
partly
overgrown
by
ivy
and
brambles
,
and
giving
some
slight
evidence
of
the
vast
dimensions
of
the
majestic
pile
formerly
occupying
the
spot
.
<EOS>
The
Priory
of
Lewes
,
the
first
of
the
Cluniac
order
in
England
,
was
founded
in
the
latter
part
of
the
eleventh
century
by
William
de
Warenne
and
Gundreda
<EOS>
his
wife
,
daughter
of
the
Conqueror
,
and
was
ruthlessly
destroyed
at
the
period
of
the
Reformation
by
command
of
Thomas
Lord
Cromwell
.
<EOS>
The
size
and
splendour
of
the
conventual
church
—
a
portion
only
of
the
monastery
—
may
be
estimated
by
the
report
of
Cromwell
’s
commissioner
,
John
Portmarus
—
a
name
to
be
held
in
abhorrence
by
the
antiquary
—
who
thus
wrote
to
his
employer
in
1538
:
“
<EOS>
I
advertised
your
lordship
of
the
length
and
greatness
of
this
church
,
how
we
had
begun
to
pull
the
whole
down
to
the
ground
,
and
what
manner
and
fashion
we
used
in
pulling
it
down
.
<EOS>
I
told
your
lordship
of
a
vault
on
the
right
side
of
the
high
altar
,
that
was
borne
with
four
pillars
,
having
about
it
five
chapels
,
which
be
compassed
in
with
the
walls
,
70
steps
of
length
,
that
is
feet
210
.
<EOS>
Now
we
are
plucking
down
a
higher
vault
borne
up
by
four
thick
and
gross
pillars
,
14
foot
from
side
to
side
,
about
in
circumference
45
feet
.
<EOS>
”From
<EOS>
the
measurement
furnished
by
this
Vandal
,
we
learn
that
the
circumference
of
the
conventual
church
was
1558
feet
;
the
thickness
of
the
steeple
walls
10
feet
,
and
the
height
of
the
steeple
above
the
roof
of
the
stately
fabric
,
which
was
near
100
feet
high
,
90
feet
.
<EOS>
Of
these
ponderous
pillars
,
storied
windows
,
vaulted
chapels
,
embowed
roof
,
high
altar
,
steeple
,
cloisters
,
and
proud
monuments
,
all
are
gone
.
<EOS>
Even
the
bones
of
the
illustrious
founders
of
the
hallowed
pile
have
been
disinterred
,
and
conveyed
to
another
resting
-
place!Out
of
the
disjointed
fragments
left
—
here
a
range
of
thick
walls
,
with
gaping
apertures
—
there
a
solitary
,
misshapen
piece
of
grey
masonry
—
further
on
a
yawning
pit
—
it
is
scarcely
possible
for
the
eye
of
fancy
to
reconstruct
the
magnificent
edifice
.
<EOS>
The
knave
Portmarus
did
his
work
effectually
,
and
the
only
regret
is
,
that
he
did
not
obtain
the
same
reward
for
his
services
from
Cromwell
which
the
latter
obtained
from
his
master
.
<EOS>
But
though
nothing
but
a
few
venerable
walls
told
of
the
former
magnitude
and
grandeur
of
the
ancient
priory
and
its
church
,
still
those
ruins
were
picturesque
and
beautiful
.
<EOS>
A
clear
rill
flowed
through
the
spacious
court
,
washing
the
base
of
the
ivy
-
grown
fragments
,
and
into
this
rill
the
dogs
instantly
plunged
to
drink
and
bathe
.
<EOS>
A
herd
of
goats
wandered
amidst
the
broken
walls
,
nibbling
the
rich
pasture
afforded
by
the
turf
.
<EOS>
Within
a
bow
-
shot
of
the
priory
,
on
the
south
-
west
,
stood
a
very
singular
structure
,
which
has
now
totally
disappeared
.
<EOS>
This
was
an
immense
pigeon
-
house
,
built
of
brick
,
in
the
form
of
a
cross
,
with
a
tower
in
the
centre
.
<EOS>
The
structure
was
as
large
as
many
a
church
—
much
larger
,
indeed
,
than
our
diminutive
church
of
Ovingdean
—
and
its
proportions
will
be
readily
conceived
when
we
mention
that
it
contained
upwards
of
three
thousand
holes
for
pigeons
,
constructed
of
hewn
chalk
-
stone
.
<EOS>
Around
this
gigantic
dove
-
house
clouds
of
pigeons
circled
;
and
when
by
accident
the
whole
flock
arose
together
,
the
air
was
almost
darkened
,
while
the
flapping
of
wings
was
prodigious
.
<EOS>
Hard
by
the
priory
ruins
on
the
east
,
and
overlooking
them
,
stood
that
remarkable
mound
,
the
construction
of
which
has
been
attributed
to
one
of
the
Earls
of
Dorset
;
though
the
hillock
was
probably
,
as
has
been
conjectured
,
thrown
up
in
monkish
times
,
and
designed
for
a
Calvary
.
<EOS>
Undoubtedly
,
no
better
position
whereon
to
rear
cross
or
chapel
could
be
found
than
is
afforded
by
this
artificial
eminence
.
<EOS>
The
large
but
shallow
excavation
at
its
foot
—
jocosely
designated
the
Dripping
-
Pan
—
<EOS>
shows
<EOS>
whence
the
soil
was
taken
to
compose
the
mound
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Maunsel
’s
sole
purpose
in
seeking
this
retired
spot
being
to
leave
Dulcia
within
it
during
his
visit
to
Zachary
Trangmar
,
he
presently
dismounted
,
and
consigning
old
Rupert
to
the
charge
of
the
ostreger
,
and
promising
speedy
return
,
he
went
his
way
.
<EOS>
Amid
a
scene
so
beautiful
,
and
on
a
day
so
bright
and
sunny
,
with
so
many
objects
of
great
and
peculiar
interest
around
her
—
the
ruins
of
the
antique
priory
,
with
its
historical
associations
—
the
gigantic
dove
-
house
,
with
its
myriad
occupants
,
in
itself
a
never
-
wearying
spectacle
—
the
neighbouring
mound
—
the
old
and
picturesque
town
of
Lewes
,
with
its
quaint
,
climbing
houses
and
its
towering
castle
—
the
noble
amphitheatre
of
downs
encircling
her
,
and
now
glowing
radiantly
in
the
sunshine
—
with
this
picture
before
her
,
Dulcia
might
have
been
glad
to
be
left
to
its
contemplation
for
a
while
,
had
her
mind
been
at
ease
.
<EOS>
But
,
alas
!
<EOS>
ever
since
the
interview
with
the
terrible
captain
of
Ironsides
<EOS>
new
fears
had
beset
her
,
and
full
of
anxiety
for
Clavering
and
her
father
,
she
found
it
impossible
to
enjoy
the
various
objects
of
attraction
displayed
before
her
.
<EOS>
After
gazing
listlessly
around
,
scarcely
noticing
the
cloud
of
doves
hovering
overhead
,
or
alighting
on
the
ruins
,
and
which
specially
attracted
the
attention
of
Eustace
Saxby
,
making
him
long
to
try
the
merlin
at
such
a
wonderful
“
flight
,
”
Dulcia
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
little
rill
flowing
at
her
feet
,
and
pensively
awaited
the
colonel
’s
return
.

IllustrationCHAPTER

-
Beggar
Hall
And
Its
InmateTHE
pleasant
suburb
of
Southover
,
now
constituting
an
important
portion
of
Lewes
itself
,
consisted
,
at
the
time
of
which
we
write
,
of
a
few
scattered
houses
,
some
of
which
skirted
the
road
leading
past
the
church
dedicated
to
Saint
John
the
Baptist
,
where
now
rest
the
bones
of
William
de
Warenne
and
Gundreda
;
while
others
were
built
on
the
south
side
of
the
gently
sloping
and
well
-
wooded
hill
.
<EOS>
A
clear
brook
flowing
through
a
charming
valley
separated
the
suburb
from
the
parent
town
.
<EOS>
Towards
this
valley
our
old
Cavalier
now
wended
his
way
.
<EOS>
Traversing
a
road
shaded
by
noble
trees
,
and
crossing
a
little
bridge
over
the
brook
,
he
presently
reached
the
porch
of
an
ancient
mansion
.
<EOS>
Though
ancient
,
the
house
was
in
excellent
preservation
;
the
hard
grey
Caen
stone
of
which
it
was
constructed
looking
as
fresh
as
if
it
had
only
just
let
the
mason
’s
chisel
,
and
promising
to
resist
the
destructive
action
of
the
weather
for
centuries
to
come
.
<EOS>
On
either
side
of
the
porch
—
to
approach
which
a
couple
of
steps
leading
into
a
small
court
had
to
be
descended
—
was
a
far-
projecting
wing
,
furnished
with
bay
mullioned
windows
.
<EOS>
The
wings
had
gable
roofs
,
and
on
the
northerly
side
of
the
habitation
there
was
a
massive
stone
chimney
of
very
ornamental
construction
.
<EOS>
A
tolerably
extensive
garden
was
attached
to
the
house
,
laid
out
in
the
old
-
fashioned
style
,
planted
with
yew-
trees
and
evergreens
,
possessing
good
walls
for
fruit
,
and
watered
by
the
brook
that
flowed
through
the
valley
.
<EOS>
Hospitality
on
a
profuse
scale
might
have
been
anticipated
from
such
a
goodly
exterior
as
was
presented
by
Mock
-
Beggar
Hall
—
for
so
was
the
house
designated
,
perhaps
in
derision
—
but
slight
hospitality
was
practised
within
it
.
<EOS>
The
door
did
not
stand
wide
open
so
as
to
admit
a
view
into
a
spacious
hall
,
thronged
with
servingmen
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
it
was
closely
barred
.
<EOS>
No
smoke
issuing
from
the
massive
stone
chimney
told
of
preparations
for
good
cheer
.
<EOS>
Most
of
the
chambers
were
dismantled
,
while
the
few
that
were
still
occupied
were
meagrely
furnished
.
<EOS>
In
the
kitchen
,
where
many
a
noble
sirloin
and
fatted
haunch
had
erstwhile
been
roasted
,
little
cooking
now
went
on
.
<EOS>
The
house
looked
starved
.
<EOS>
In
it
dwelt
a
hard
,
griping
usurer
and
miser
.
<EOS>
Old
Zachary
Trangmar
had
known
how
to
profit
by
the
troublous
times
in
which
he
lived
.
<EOS>
When
men
are
driven
to
extremity
,
money
must
be
had
at
any
rate
of
usance
,
or
at
any
sacrifice
,
and
the
desperate
circumstances
of
most
of
the
adherents
of
the
royal
cause
had
been
the
old
usurer
’s
gain
.
<EOS>
A
loan
under
such
circumstances
had
put
him
in
possession
of
Mock
-
Beggar
Hall
—
heretofore
known
as
the
Priory
House
.
<EOS>
He
had
sold
its
handsome
furniture
and
fine
pictures
,
and
meant
to
sell
the
house
itself
,
as
soon
as
a
favourable
opportunity
for
doing
so
should
offer
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
he
occupied
it
himself
.
<EOS>
Old
Zachary
<EOS>
’s
establishment
consisted
of
three
persons
only
,
an
aged
domestic
and
his
wife
,
who
having
lived
with
him
for
many
years
,
were
accustomed
to
his
thrifty
and
penurious
habits
,
and
a
stout
porter
,
Skrow
Antram
by
name
,
whom
he
thought
it
necessary
to
maintain
as
a
protection
against
robbers
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Maunsel
knocked
at
the
door
of
Mock
-
Beggar
Hall
,
and
presently
afterwards
a
little
grated
wicket
was
opened
,
and
a
surly
,
ill
-
favoured
countenance
appeared
at
it
.
<EOS>
After
scrutinizing
the
colonel
for
a
moment
,
Skrow
Antram
,
for
it
was
he
,
grunted
out
a
word
of
recognition
,
shut
-
to
the
wicket
,
and
departed
,
as
was
evident
by
his
retreating
footsteps
,
to
consult
his
master
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
,
he
returned
and
unbarred
the
door
.
<EOS>
Thus
displayed
to
view
,
Skrow
Antram
proved
to
be
a
powerfully
built
man
,
of
middle
age
,
and
dark
,
sinister
aspect
,
<EOS>
who
,
it
would
seem
,
could
scarcely
have
been
hired
on
the
strength
of
his
honest
looks
.
<EOS>
He
wore
a
leathern
doublet
with
pewter
buttons
,
with
petticoat
breeches
of
green
serge
tied
at
the
knee
.
<EOS>
Making
a
clownish
obeisance
to
the
colonel
,
Skrow
forthwith
proceeded
to
usher
him
into
his
master
’s
presence
.
<EOS>
Old
Zachary
Trangmar
occupied
a
room
on
the
ground
floor
,
looking
into
the
garden
.
<EOS>
It
had
once
been
a
library
,
but
books
and
book
shelves
were
gone
;
and
the
sole
piece
of
furniture
placed
against
the
bare
walls
was
a
large
dingy
oak
press
.
<EOS>
The
old
usurer
was
seated
at
a
table
covered
with
deeds
and
papers
.
<EOS>
Within
reach
of
his
hand
was
a
pair
of
small
scales
,
nicely
adjusted
for
weighing
gold
.
<EOS>
Further
on
lay
a
pile
of
account
-
books
with
sheepskin
backs
.
<EOS>
Close
behind
the
money
-
lender
,
on
the
floor
,
was
a
large
chest
,
bound
with
iron
hoops
.
<EOS>
Though
between
seventy
and
eighty
,
old
Zachary
was
as
quick
of
intellect
as
ever
,
and
keen
were
the
glances
which
he
cast
from
beneath
his
grey
overhanging
eyebrows
at
the
colonel
,
on
the
entrance
of
the
latter
.
<EOS>
Old
Zachary
wore
a
black
velvet
doublet
,
much
frayed
,
and
over
it
a
loose
murrey
-
coloured
robe
,
which
,
like
the
doublet
,
had
seen
better
days
.
<EOS>
A
black
silk
skull
-
cap
protected
his
bald
head
.
<EOS>
His
shrunk
shanks
were
encased
in
nether
-
hose
of
lambswool
,
and
his
feet
thrust
into
a
pair
of
pantoufles
.
<EOS>
His
features
were
sharp
and
pinched
,
his
frame
excessively
thin
,
and
his
skin
as
yellow
as
the
parchment
of
deeds
lying
beside
him
.
<EOS>
Silently
saluting
his
visitor
,
old
Zachary
motioned
him
to
a
seat
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Maunsel
bowed
gravely
and
somewhat
haughtily
,
and
took
the
chair
,
but
uttered
not
a
word
till
Skrow
Antram
had
retired
.
<EOS>
The
usurer
then
looked
at
him
with
a
shrewd
smile
.
<EOS>
“The
old
business
,
I
presume
,
colonel
?
<EOS>
More
money
—
ha
!
<EOS>
Nothing
else
would
bring
you
to
Mock
-
Beggar
Hall
,
as
fools
call
my
dwelling
.
<EOS>
You
could
n’t
have
come
at
a
worse
time
.
<EOS>
All
going
out
—
not
a
doit
coming
in
.
<EOS>
As
I
hope
to
be
saved
,
I
have
n’t
received
a
noble
for
this
fortnight
past!”“What
of
that
,
thou
avaricious
rascal
?
”
<EOS>
cried
the
colonel
.
<EOS>
“
Thy
strong
-
boxes
are
replete
with
rose
-
rials
,
broad
pieces
,
and
angels
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
well
,
man
—
so
attempt
not
to
plead
poverty
with
me
.
”“Heaven
<EOS>
forfend
that
I
should
plead
poverty
!
”
<EOS>
Zachary
returned
.
<EOS>
“
I
meant
not
that
.
<EOS>
Money
enough
is
owing
to
me
in
all
conscience
;
and
if
I
only
get
my
dues
<EOS>
I
shall
account
myself
rich
.
<EOS>
But
ready
money
is
what
I
lack
.
<EOS>
You
are
mistaken
if
you
suppose
my
chests
are
full
,
colonel
.
<EOS>
They
have
been
well
-
nigh
emptied
by
you
and
your
brother
Cavaliers
,
and
my
goodly
jaco
-
buses
and
caroluses
,
my
rose-
rials
and
spur
-
rials
,
my
angels
and
double
crowns
,
have
been
turned
into
musty
parchments
.
<EOS>
”“So
<EOS>
much
the
better
for
thee
,
thou
insatiate
extortioner
.
<EOS>
Here
is
another
parchment
to
add
to
thy
stock
.
<EOS>
”Whereupon
,
the
colonel
took
the
deed
from
out
his
doublet
.
<EOS>
“I
thought
as
much
,
”
the
old
usurer
exclaimed
,
affecting
to
groan
,
though
his
eye
twinkled
with
covetous
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
“
Give
it
me
,
and
let
me
look
at
it
,
”
he
added
,
clutching
at
the
deed
like
a
vulture
.
<EOS>
“
I
see
!
<EOS>
I
see
!
<EOS>
this
relates
to
your
farm
at
Piddinghoe
,
which
brings
you
in
a
hundred
nobles
,
or
about
thirty-
eight
pounds
a
year
?
<EOS>
What
sum
do
you
want
,
colonel?”“Two
hundred
pounds
to
pay
my
fine
to
the
state
—
I
must
have
it
at
once
,
thou
old
skinflint
.
<EOS>
”“You
are
very
peremptory
,
colonel
;
but
suppose
I
can
not
lend
it
<EOS>
you?”“Then
I
must
obtain
the
money
elsewhere
,
or
the
commissioners
must
seize
upon
the
farm
and
satisfy
themselves
.
<EOS>
I
warrant
me
they
will
be
content
.
<EOS>
”“Nay
,
that
were
a
pity
indeed
—
and
rather
than
the
unconscionable
rascals
should
get
it
,
I
will
find
the
two
hundred
pounds
;
even
though
I
should
inconvenience
myself
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
have
a
bond
,
colonel
.
”“Agreed
,
”
the
old
Cavalier
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
I
know
thy
mode
of
proceeding
too
well
to
dispute
that
point
with
thee
.
<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
the
rate
of
usance
as
before
?
”
<EOS>
Zachary
cried
,
quickly
.
<EOS>
“The
rate
of
usance
as
before
,
thirty
per
cent
—
agreed
!
”
<EOS>
the
colonel
rejoined
,
with
a
sigh
.
“
<EOS>
‘
Tis
too
much
!
<EOS>
But
I
can
not
help
myself
,
and
must
submit
to
thy
extortion
.
<EOS>
”“Nay
,
but
consider
the
risks
I
incur
,
colonel
<EOS>
,
”
the
old
usurer
rejoined—“consider
<EOS>
the
disturbed
state
of
affairs
.
<EOS>
If
we
lived
under
a
stable
government
—
under
a
Monarchy
—
it
might
be
different
—
but
under
a
Republic—”“Tut
!
<EOS>
tut
!
<EOS>
all
knaves
prosper
under
the
Republic
—
to
the
ruin
of
honest
men
,
”
the
old
Cavalier
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
you
will
ever
have
a
gibe
at
the
Roundheads
,
colonel
.
<EOS>
And
I
marvel
not
at
it
,
for
they
have
used
you
and
your
party
scurvily
.
<EOS>
My
own
sympathies
,
”
he
added
,
in
a
lower
tone
,
“
are
for
the
royal
cause
—
<EOS>
but
I
dare
not
manifest
them
.
<EOS>
‘
Twould
be
my
ruin
.
”“Miserable
<EOS>
hypocrite
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
colonel
.
<EOS>
“You
disbelieve
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
give
you
proof
of
my
sincerity
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
lives
of
many
a
Cavalier
of
consequence
in
my
power
—
but
they
are
safe
with
me
.
<EOS>
And
so
is
their
royal
Master
,
whose
present
retreat
I
could
—
<EOS>
if
I
chose
—
point
out
.
<EOS>
”“Mark
<EOS>
me
,
Master
Trangmar
,
”
the
colonel
rejoined
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
“
If
the
exalted
personage
to
whom
thou
hast
just
alluded
should
be
betrayed
by
thy
instrumentality
,
it
shall
profit
thee
little
.
<EOS>
Nothing
shall
save
thee
from
the
sword
of
the
avenger
.
<EOS>
”“I
would
not
betray
him
for
all
the
wealth
of
the
Commonwealth
,
”
the
old
usurer
hastily
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
It
was
to
prove
my
loyalty
that
I
unlocked
my
breast
to
you
,
knowing
you
might
be
safely
confided
in
.
”“Since
<EOS>
you
have
said
thus
much
,
you
must
say
yet
more
,
and
inform
me
where
the
royal
fugitive
now
hides
his
head
.
<EOS>
”“Not
<EOS>
so
,
colonel
,
”
Zachary
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
I
can
keep
a
secret
as
well
as
yourself
.
<EOS>
”“As
<EOS>
you
please
,
sir
;
but
you
must
allow
me
to
put
my
own
construction
on
your
silence
.
<EOS>
Let
us
conclude
our
business
.
”“Readily
<EOS>
,
colonel
,
”
the
usurer
returned
.
<EOS>
Upon
which
he
unlocked
the
chest
standing
near
him
,
and
taking
out
a
leather
bag
,
placed
it
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
Just
as
he
had
untied
this
bag
,
and
was
pouring
forth
its
glittering
contents
,
the
door
was
suddenly
opened
by
Skrow
Antram
,
who
entered
,
followed
by
a
tall
man
.
<EOS>
Almost
involuntarily
,
the
old
usurer
spread
his
skinny
hands
over
the
heap
of
gold
,
sharply
rebuking
Skrow
for
coming
in
unsummoned
,
and
glancing
suspiciously
at
the
person
by
whom
he
was
accompanied
.
<EOS>
The
latter
,
though
wearing
a
plain
riding
-
dress
of
the
precise
Puritan
cut
,
and
mud
-
bespattered
boots
,
together
with
a
tall
steeple
-
crowned
hat
and
long
cloak
totally
destitute
of
velvet
and
lace
,
had
nevertheless
a
certain
air
of
distinction
,
combined
with
great
dignity
of
deportment
,
and
might
be
described
as
looking
like
a
Cavalier
in
the
guise
of
a
Roundhead
.
<EOS>
He
was
of
middle
age
—
perhaps
a
little
past
it
—
but
appeared
full
of
vigour
.
<EOS>
His
features
were
handsome
,
and
rather
haughty
in
expression
;
his
locks
were
clipped
short
,
in
puritanical
fashion
.
<EOS>
The
moment
Colonel
Maunsel
cast
eyes
upon
the
stranger
he
knew
him
to
be
Lord
Wilmot
,
the
devoted
attendant
of
the
fugitive
king
;
while
on
his
part
the
nobleman
,
recognizing
a
friend
,
signed
to
the
other
not
to
betray
any
knowledge
of
him
.
<EOS>
“How
<EOS>
dared
you
admit
this
gentleman
,
Skrow
?
<EOS>
Hath
he
bribed
you
to
let
him
in
,
eh
?
”
<EOS>
the
old
usurer
cried
,
with
so
angry
a
look
at
the
porter
,
that
the
latter
beat
a
hasty
retreat
.
<EOS>
“
What
seek
you
,
sir
?
”
<EOS>
Zachary
added
to
the
new
comer
.
<EOS>
“
What
business
have
you
with
me?”“Read
that
letter
from
Colonel
George
Gunter
,
of
Racton
,
and
you
will
see
,
”
was
Lord
Wilmot
’s
reply
.
<EOS>
“
He
has
urgent
and
immediate
need
of
five
hundred
pounds
,
and
has
despatched
me
for
it
.
<EOS>
”“You
have
come
on
a
fool
’s
errand
,
sir
,
”
old
Zachary
rejoined
,
sharply
.
<EOS>
“
Colonel
Gunter
has
had
more
money
of
mine
than
I
shall
ever
see
back
again
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n’t
lend
him
another
noble
.
<EOS>
”“Read
<EOS>
the
letter
before
you
give
an
answer
,
”
Lord
Wilmot
cried
,
authoritatively
.
<EOS>
While
old
Zachary
glanced
over
the
missive
,
signs
like
those
of
freemasonry
passed
between
the
nobleman
and
Colonel
Maunsel
,
from
which
the
latter
understood
for
what
purpose
the
money
was
wanted
.
<EOS>
In
another
moment
the
old
usurer
threw
down
the
letter
.
<EOS>
“I
wo
n’t
lend
the
money
,
”
he
cried
,
in
an
inflexible
tone
.
<EOS>
“
You
may
go
back
to
Colonel
Gunter
and
tell
him
so
.
<EOS>
”“Dost
<EOS>
thou
not
perceive
that
he
promises
to
pay
thee
back
double
the
amount
in
two
months
?
”
<EOS>
Lord
Wilmot
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
“
Is
not
that
enough
,
thou
old
extortioner?”“Ay
,
but
he
offers
me
no
security
.
<EOS>
He
can
offer
none
;
since
I
hold
the
title-
deeds
of
his
whole
estate
in
yonder
press
.
<EOS>
”“But
<EOS>
I
must
have
the
money
,
I
tell
thee
.
<EOS>
Much
depends
upon
it
,
”
Lord
Wilmot
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
“If
<EOS>
the
kingdom
depended
upon
it
,
you
should
not
have
it
from
me
—
without
security
,
”
the
old
usurer
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“I
will
be
thy
security
,
Master
Trangmar
,
”
Colonel
Maunsel
interposed
.
<EOS>
“
This
gentleman
,
I
am
well
assured
,
is
a
person
of
honour
.
<EOS>
Give
him
the
two
hundred
pounds
you
intended
for
me
.
<EOS>
Add
other
three
hundred
.
<EOS>
Thou
shalt
have
my
bond
,
and
further
security
on
another
farm
of
mine
at
Bevingdean
.
<EOS>
”“You
are
a
true
friend
to
the
good
cause
,
sir
,
”
cried
Lord
Wilmot
.
<EOS>
“Ah
!
<EOS>
I
begin
to
see
what
it
all
means
now
,
”
the
old
usurer
exclaimed
,
rubbing
his
skinny
hands
.
<EOS>
“
Well
,
sir
,
who
ever
you
may
be
,
and
I
have
an
inkling
that
I
have
seen
your
face
before
,
you
shall
have
the
money
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
I
will
go
further
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Maunsel
<EOS>
’s
generosity
shall
not
be
taxed
so
far
as
to
deprive
him
of
the
two
hundred
pounds
which
he
requires
for
his
own
use
.
<EOS>
He
shall
have
that
amount
,
without
reference
to
the
loan
to
your
master
—
I
crave
your
pardon
—
to
Colonel
Gunter
.
”
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
he
again
unlocked
the
coffer
,
and
took
out
five
bags
.
<EOS>
“
Each
of
these
bags
,
”
he
continued
,
“
contains
a
hundred
pounds
in
gold
.
<EOS>
Can
you
carry
them?”“I
will
make
shift
to
do
so
,
”
Lord
Wilmot
rejoined
,
bestowing
them
hastily
about
his
person
.
<EOS>
“
My
friend
is
much
beholden
to
you
,
Master
Trangmar
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Maunsel
,
”
he
added
,
in
a
low
tone
,
to
the
old
Cavalier
,
“
you
have
rendered
his
Majesty
a
signal
service
,
and
I
thank
you
heartily
in
his
name
.
”“Enough
<EOS>
,
my
lord
,
”
the

<EOS>
there
is
a
visitor

has
cost
you
a
good

sum

<EOS>
Zachary
remarked
,
drily
,
as
Lord
Wilmot
departed
.
<EOS>
“The

me
nothing

the
other
returned
,
coldly
.
<EOS>
“
The
money
will
be
certainly
repaid

”“Be
<EOS>
not
too
sure
of
that
,
”
the
usurer
said
.
<EOS>
“
One
can
be
certain
of
nothing
now-
a
-
days
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
can
pretty
well
tell
how
it
will
be
employed
;
and
I
sincerely
hope
it
may
lead
to
the
desired
result
.
<EOS>
”“I
heartily
hope
it
may
—
for
whatever
purpose
it
is
designed
.
<EOS>
And
now
let
us
complete
our
transaction
,
Master
Trangmar
.
<EOS>
I
am
somewhat
pressed
for
time
.
<EOS>
”“I
will
only
detain
you
while
I
draw
out
a
memorandum
for
your
signature
,
colonel
.
<EOS>
My
scrivener
,
Thopas
Tipnoke
,
shall
wait
upon
you
at
Ovingdean
Grange
with
the
bond
—
it
will
be
an
obligatio
simplex
,
as
Tipnoke
would
style
it
—
and
he
can
receive
from
you
the
title
-
deeds
of
your
farm
at
Bevingdean
,
which
you
propose
to
deposit
with
me
.
<EOS>
That
is
understood
,
and
agreed
,
eh
?
<EOS>
Will
you
please
to
count
this
gold
“
—
thrusting
the
heap
towards
him—“and
<EOS>
see
that
you
have
your
just
amount
.
<EOS>
”A
few
more
minutes
sufficed
to
bring
the
transaction
to
an
end
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Maunsel
signed
the
document
prepared
by
the
crafty
usurer
,
who
was
as
great
<EOS>
an
adept
in
such
matters
as
his
scrivener
,
Tipnoke
,
and
received
,
in
exchange
,
the
two
hundred
golden
caroluses
.
<EOS>
The
usurer
attended
him
to
the
door
,
and
,
just
as
he
was
about
to
depart
,
said
to
him
,
“
Let
me
give
you
one
piece
of
counsel
before
you
go
,
Colonel
Maunsel
.
<EOS>
A
rigorous
search
is
about
to
be
made
of
all
houses
in
this
part
of
the
county
suspected
of
harbouring
fugitive
Royalists
,
and
as
you
are
accounted
—
be
not
offended
,
I
pray
you
—
one
of
the
most
obnoxious
malignants
hereabouts
<EOS>
,
Ovingdean
Grange
hath
the
foremost
place
on
the
list
.
<EOS>
I
ask
you
not
whether
you
have
any
one
hidden
within
your
house
?
<EOS>
If
it
be
so
,
be
warned
by
what
I
tell
you
,
and
if
you
value
your
friend
’s
life
and
your
own
safety
,
let
him
depart
without
delay
.
<EOS>
The
search
will
be
made
by
an
officer
of
the
Lord
General
’s
own
troop
of
Ironsides
,
Captain
Stelfax
,
who
hath
lately
come
to
Lewes
—
a
merciless
man
,
with
the
powers
of
a
provost-
marshal
—
and
if
he
should
find
an
unfortunate
Royalist
,
he
would
think
no
more
of
shooting
him
than
of
stringing
up
a
deserter
.
<EOS>
Excuse
me
,
colonel
.
<EOS>
I
have
thought
it
my
duty
to
warn
you
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
thank
you
,
good
Master
Trangmar
,
”
the
old
Cavalier
replied
,
striving
to
conceal
his
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
“
I
will
take
all
needful
precaution
.
<EOS>
I
met
this
Captain
Stelfax
on
my
way
hither
,
and
he
threatened
me
with
a
domiciliary
visit
.
<EOS>
”“A
pest
upon
him
!
”
<EOS>
ejaculated
the
old
usurer
.
<EOS>
“
His
visits
are
like
witches
’
curses
—
they
kill
.
<EOS>
Fare
you
well
,
colonel
.
<EOS>
These
are
sad
times
.
<EOS>
When
good
men
part
,
now
-
a
-
days
,
they
know
not
how
,
or
when
,
they
may
meet
again
.
<EOS>
Heaven
grant
his
Majesty
a
speedy
restoration!—and
<EOS>
should
we
live
to
see
that
blessed
day
<EOS>
,
you
will
not
fail
to
tell
him
,
I
trust
,
who
lent
the
five
hundred
pounds
.
<EOS>
”“Nor
to
mention
the
rate
of
interest
exacted
for
the
loan
,
”
rejoined
the
colonel
,
unable
to
repress
a
smile
.
<EOS>
“
Well
,
so
thou
wilt
treat
any
pestilent
Puritan
in
the
same
fashion
,
I
care
not
.
<EOS>
”“Trust
<EOS>
me
,
I
will
sweat
him
properly
if
I
get
such
an
one
into
my
clutches
,
”
old
Zachary
replied
,
with
a
chuckle
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
Colonel
Maunsel
quitted
Mock
-
Beggar
Hall
.
<EOS>
On
returning
to
the
priory
ruins
he
found
Dulcia
and
the
ostreger
where
he
had
left
them
.
<EOS>
With
Saxby
’s
aid
,
he
got
once
more
into
the
saddle
,
and
the
party
then
started
for
Kingston
,
whence
<EOS>
they
mounted
the
steep
hill
at
the
foot
of
which
the
little
village
is
nestled
,
and
so
shaped
their
course
across
the
clowns
towards
Ovingdean
Grange
.
<EOS>
But
we
must
hie
thither
before
them
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IIIHow
Ninian
Delivered
His
MessageIF
Ninian
had
been
mounted
upon
a
swift
steed
he
could
not
have
reached
the
Grange
more
quickly
than
he
contrived
to
do
by
the
use
of
his
own
active
limbs
.
<EOS>
Not
deeming
it
necessary
to
inquire
whether
Captain
Stelfax
and
his
troopers
had
made
their
appearance
,
for
he
felt
certain
he
had
beaten
them
,
the
young
falconer
’s
first
business
on
entering
the
house
was
to
seek
out
John
Habergeon
.
<EOS>
As
luck
would
have
it
,
he
found
him
in
the
buttery
,
discussing
a
jug
of
ale
and
a
mouthful
of
bread
and
cheese—“bren
cheese
,
”
the
old
trooper
would
have
termed
it
in
his
Sussex
vernacular
—
with
Giles
Moppett
and
old
Martin
Geere
,
and
instantly
delivered
the
colonel
’s
message
to
him
,
taking
care
to
add
that
the
leader
of
the
Ironsides
entertained
the
belief
that
Captain
Clavering
had
been
slain
at
Worcester
.
<EOS>
“The
latter
part
of
thy
news
is
better
than
thy
first
,
lad
,
”
John
cried
,
swallowing
down
a
huge
mouthful
,
and
springing
to
his
feet
<EOS>
“
Go
all
of
ye
,
and
spread
the
intelligence
amongst
the
rest
of
the
servants
.
<EOS>
Take
care
<EOS>
they
are
all
of
one
story
,
<EOS>
d’ye
mind
?
<EOS>
They
will
be
sharply
questioned
by
this
cursed
Roundhead
officer
—
know
him
well
by
report
.
<EOS>
Keep
out
of
sight
,
Ninian
,
should
the
Ironsides
come
hither
before
the
colonel
returns
,
or
they
will
understand
that
thou
hast
been
sent
on
to
give
the
alarm
.
<EOS>
”John
<EOS>
then
hurried
upstairs
,
and
acquainting
Clavering
with
the
message
which
had
just
been
brought
by
Ninian
,
told
him
he
must
take
instant
refuge
within
the
hiding
-
place
,
and
remain
there
till
the
danger
was
passed
.
<EOS>
Seared
by
the
imminence
of
the
peril
,
and
apprehensive
of
discovery
,
Mr.
Beard
counselled
flight
;
but
John
scouted
the
idea
.
<EOS>
“Where
is
the
captain
to
fly
to
?
”
<EOS>
the
old
trooper
cried
.
<EOS>
“
Were
he
to
venture
forth
,
those
lynx
-
eyed
Ironsides
would
be
likely
enough
to
capture
him
.
<EOS>
And
then
that
rascally
Micklegift
is
playing
the
spy
upon
all
our
movements
.
<EOS>
”“Ay
,
there
is
another
risk
!
<EOS>
How
are
we
to
guard
against
that
?
”
<EOS>
Clavering
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
“
You
say
Micklegift
is
aware
of
my
return
,
and
knows
I
am
concealed
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
Will
he
not
betray
me
to
Stelfax?”“No
.
<EOS>
His
lips
are
sealed
till
to
-
morrow
,
”
the
old
trooper
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
Ask
me
not
why
?
<EOS>
I
had
rather
not
explain
.
<EOS>
”“You
have
good
reason
for
what
you
assert
,
no
doubt
,
John
,
”
Mr.
Beard
remarked
;
“
though
such
tender
consideration
for
us
seems
wholly
inconsistent
with
Micklegift
’s
character
.
”“It
<EOS>
is
perfectly
consistent
with
his
character
,
as
your
reverence
would
admit
,
if
you
knew
all
,
”
John
replied
.
<EOS>
“
But
the
Ironsides
may
be
upon
us
at
any
moment
—
don’t
suppose
they
will
give
us
notice
of
their
approach
.
<EOS>
In
with
you
,
captain
,
”
he
continued
,
touching
the
secret
spring
in
the
mantelpiece
,
and
disclosing
the
entrance
to
the
place
of
concealment
.
<EOS>
“
You
have
all
you
require
,
and
are
provisioned
for
a
week
.
<EOS>
Do
n’t
be
disheartened
,
if
we
should
be
unable
to
communicate
with
you
for
some
time
;
and
let
no
summons
—
no
alarm
—
induce
you
to
come
forth
.
<EOS>
Mind
that
.
<EOS>
”“I
will
obey
your
directions
implicitly
,
John
,
”
the
young
man
said
.
<EOS>
“
Yet
my
mind
misgives
me
,
and
I
enter
this
retreat
with
reluctance
.
<EOS>
”“Have
<EOS>
a
good
heart
,
sir
,
”
John
cried
,
cheerily
.
<EOS>
“
All
will
turn
out
well
.
”“Heaven
<EOS>
grant
it
!
”
<EOS>
Mr.
Beard
ejaculated
,
fervently
.
<EOS>
“
Place
yourself
under
the
care
of
Providence
,
my
son
;
and
my
prayers
shall
also
be
offered
for
your
safety
.
<EOS>
”Upon
<EOS>
this
,
Clavering
passed
through
the
aperture
,
and
the
next
moment
the
pillar
was
returned
to
its
place
.
<EOS>
It
was
time
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
had
Clavering
made
good
his
retreat
,
when
the
blast
of
a
trumpet
was
heard
outside
the
house
,
proclaiming
the
arrival
of
the
Ironsides
.

CHAPTER
IVIn
<EOS>
What
Manner
<EOS>
The
Captain
Of
The
IronsidesEmployed
<EOS>
His
Time
At
The
GrangeAT
<EOS>
this
fearful
summons
,
old
Martin
Geere
,
Giles
Moppett
,
and
some
others
rushed
to
the
door
,
and
to
their
great
dismay
,
found
the
house
invested
by
a
troop
of
armed
men
,
who
,
having
ridden
through
the
gateway
,
were
now
drawn
up
before
the
porch
.
<EOS>
“What
ho
,
fellow
!
”
<EOS>
cried
their
red
-
bearded
leader
,
addressing
Martin
.
<EOS>
“
We
are
come
to
pay
thy
master
a
visit
,
as
thou
seest
.
<EOS>
”“You
and
your
men
are
right
welcome
,
worshipful
captain
,
and
my
master
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
,
will
feel
greatly
honoured
,
”
old
Martin
rejoined
;
“
but
he
is
from
home
at
the
moment
,
hawking
on
the
downs
.
<EOS>
”“He
is
at
Lewes
,
thou
shouldst
say
,
<EOS>
for
I
left
him
riding
thither
scarce
an
hour
ago
with
the
Episcopalian
divine
’s
comely
daughter
,
”
Stelfax
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
As
to
welcome
,
we
should
have
little
enough
,
I
warrant
me
,
either
from
thee
or
from
thy
master
,
if
we
could
not
enforce
it
.
<EOS>
But
my
men
are
hungry
,
and
would
eat
;
thirsty
,
and
would
drink—”“They
shall
have
the
best
the
house
affords
,
worshipful
captain
,
”
old
Martin
hastened
to
say
.
<EOS>
“They
ever
do
have
of
the
best
when
they
pay
a
malignant
a
visit
,
”
rejoined
Stelfax
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
“
Your
substance
hath
been
delivered
into
our
hands
,
and
wherefore
should
we
hesitate
to
take
it
?
<EOS>
I
shall
tarry
here
until
thy
master
returns
,
for
I
have
to
interrogate
him
.
”Giving
<EOS>
the
word
to
his
men
to
dismount
,
Stelfax
next
directed
two
of
them
to
stand
at
the
door
,
and
suffer
no
one
to
go
forth
.
<EOS>
Every
other
outlet
from
the
house
was
to
be
similarly
watched
:
the
guard
to
be
relieved
every
half
-
hour
,
so
that
no
man
might
be
deprived
of
his
share
of
the
creature
comforts
to
be
found
within
.
<EOS>
Sergeant
Delves
was
instructed
to
take
the
horses
to
the
stables
,
see
them
foddered
,
and
then
rejoin
his
leader
.
<EOS>
All
these
orders
given
,
Captain
Stelfax
sprang
from
his
saddle
,
and
,
marching
into
the
entrance
-
hall
,
made
the
whole
place
resound
with
his
clattering
sword
and
heavy
boots
.
<EOS>
Old
Martin
Geere
and
the
others
kept
at
a
respectful
distance
,
anxiously
watching
him
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
the
middle
of
the
hall
,
the
formidable
leader
stood
still
,
as
if
uncertain
in
which
direction
he
should
first
bend
his
steps
.
<EOS>
“Will
<EOS>
it
please
you
to
enter
the
banqueting
-
room
,
or
the
library
,
worshipful
captain
?
”
<EOS>
Martin
Geere
inquired
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
shall
enter
every
room
in
the
house
in
turn
,
”
Stelfax
rejoined
;
“
but
I
care
not
if
I
begin
with
the
banqueting
-
room
.
<EOS>
”“A
small
collation
shall
be
served
there
in
a
moment
,
captain
,
”
said
Giles
Moppett
.
<EOS>
“Mayhap
,
your
worship
may
like
a
cup
of
Bordeaux
,
or
of
Gascoigne
wine
?
”
<EOS>
insinuated
Elias
Crundy
.
<EOS>
“Bring
a
flask
of
the
best
wine
thou
hast
in
thy
cellar
,
fellow
<EOS>
,
”
returned
Stelfax
;
“
and
broach
a
cask
of
thy
stoutest
ale
for
my
men
—
unless
they
prefer
wine
,
in
which
case
thou
wilt
give
it
them
.
<EOS>
”“They
<EOS>
shall
have
whatsoever
they
ask
for
,
of
that
your
worship
may
rest
assured
,
”
Elias
said
.
<EOS>
“Or
<EOS>
your
own
skins
will
suffer
for
it
,
I
promise
thee
,
”
Stelfax
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
It
seems
,
then
,
that
you
have
not
heard
that
the
rebellious
malignant
,
your
young
master
,
was
slain
at
Worcester?”“Alack
!
<EOS>
worshipful
captain
,
we
have
heard
the
sad
tidings
,
”
answered
Martin
Geere
,
in
a
doleful
tone
;
“
but
we
have
not
ventured
to
tell
the
colonel
.
<EOS>
Poor
gentleman
!
<EOS>
the
news
will
break
his
heart
.
<EOS>
”“Tut
!
<EOS>
thou
art
mistaken
,
”
Stelfax
cried
.
<EOS>
“
I
told
him
of
the
occurrence
myself
,
and
he
seemed
more
surprised
than
grieved
.
<EOS>
But
who
brought
you
the
news?”“An
old
trooper
of
King
Charles
’
time
,
John
Habergeon
,
captain
.
”“Where
<EOS>
is
the
knave
?
<EOS>
Bring
him
before
me
.
<EOS>
”So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
marched
into
the
banqueting
-
hall
,
and
flung
himself
into
the
arm-
chair
usually
occupied
by
the
colonel
.
<EOS>
In
hopes
of
mollifying
the
formidable
intruder
,
Giles
Moppett
and
Elias
Crundy
both
bestirred
themselves
,
and
speedily
set
wine
and
eatables
before
him
.
<EOS>
But
this
did
not
pacify
the
captain
,
for
he
roared
out
,
“
Why
comes
not
the
rogue
Habergeon
to
me
?
<EOS>
Must
I
go
fetch
him?”“I
am
here
,
captain
,
”
<EOS>
John
responded
,
entering
the
banqueting
-
room
.
<EOS>
“
What
would
you
with
me?”Close
behind
the
old
trooper
came
Sergeant
Delves
,
who
had
just
returned
from
the
stables
.
<EOS>
Stelfax
looked
sternly
at
John
,
who
stood
bolt
upright
before
him
,
never
moving
a
muscle
.
<EOS>
“Thou
shouldst
have
been
a
soldier
of
the
Commonwealth
,
fellow
,
”
observed
the
Roundhead
captain
,
approvingly—“thou
hast
<EOS>
the
look
of
an
Ironside
.
<EOS>
”“I
am
sorry
to
hear
it
,
”
John
replied
.
<EOS>
“
Your
honour
might
not
deem
it
a
compliment
were
I
to
say
that
you
are
too
well
-
looking
for
a
Puritan
,
and
have
more
the
air
of
a
roystering
Cavalier
.
<EOS>
”“Go
<EOS>
to
,
knave
,
and
liken
me
not
to
a
profane
follower
of
Jehoram
,
”
cried
Stelfax
,
not
altogether
displeased
.
<EOS>
“
Take
heed
that
thou
answerest
me
truthfully
.
<EOS>
Thou
art
newly
returned
from
that
battle
-
field
whereat
the
Young
Man
,
Charles
Stuart
,
was
utterly
routed
,
and
where
our
great
general
,
like
Pekah
,
the
son
of
Remaliah
,
slew
many
thousands
of
men
of
valour
in
one
day
because
they
had
forsaken
the
Lord
God
of
their
fathers
.
<EOS>
Didst
thou
bear
arms
in
the
service
of
Ahaz?”“I
followed
my
young
master—”“Who
paid
the
penalty
of
his
rebellious
folly
with
his
life
—
I
know
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
demand
of
thee
if
thou
wert
actually
engaged
in
the
strife?”“I
tried
to
rescue
my
young
master
when
he
was
stricken
from
his
horse
.
<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
thy
efforts
were
futile
.
<EOS>
He
was
justly
slain
,
forasmuch
as
he
hearkened
not
unto
the
words
of
Necho
,
but
came
to
fight
in
the
valley
of
Megiddo
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
blame
not
thy
fidelity
,
and
it
is
well
for
thee
that
we
take
not
account
of
the
units
of
the
host
,
but
only
of
the
captains
.
<EOS>
Thou
owest
thy
safety
to
thine
insignificance
.
<EOS>
But
if
thou
art
ever
again
caught
in
arms
against
the
Commonwealth
,
a
rope
’s
end
will
be
thy
quittance
.
<EOS>
Had
thy
young
master
been
living
,
I
might
have
spared
him
the
ceremony
of
a
court
-
martial
,
my
power
being
absolute
.
<EOS>
”“It
is
well
for
him
that
he
is
out
of
your
honour
’s
reach
,
”
returned
John
.
<EOS>
“Therein
thou
sayest
truly
,
fellow
,
”
Stelfax
rejoined
,
with
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
“
Well
,
I
have
done
with
thee
for
the
nonce
.
<EOS>
I
will
question
thee
further
when
the
profane
malignant
,
thy
old
master
,
returns
from
his
ride
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
thou
art
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
”“A
prisoner
!
”
<EOS>
John
Habergeon
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
“Ay
,
all
within
the
house
are
prisoners
during
my
tarrying
here
.
<EOS>
None
may
stir
forth
on
peril
of
life
.
<EOS>
”At
<EOS>
this
juncture
,
Mr.
Beard
and
Increase
Micklegift
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
Having
witnessed
the
arrival
of
the
troopers
from
the
parsonage
-
house
,
the
Independent
minister
had
come
over
to
watch
their
proceedings
.
<EOS>
John
Habergeon
having
informed
the
Roundhead
captain
who
the
new
-
comers
were
,
the
latter
prayed
them
to
be
seated
,
and
addressed
himself
to
the
ejected
clergyman
.
<EOS>
“Your
daughter
is
a
comely
damsel
,
Master
Beard
,
”
<EOS>
he
said—“a
very
comely
damsel
.
<EOS>
I
met
her
a
short
while
ago
,
on
the
other
side
of
the
downs
,
in
<EOS>
Colonel
Maunsel
’s
company
.
<EOS>
”“She
went
out
to
ride
with
my
honoured
patron
,
”
Mr.
Beard
replied
.
<EOS>
“You
have
been
told
,
I
doubt
not
,
of
the
death
of
your
patron
’s
son
—
the
young
malignant
,
Clavering
Maunsel
?
”
<EOS>
pursued
Stelfax
.
<EOS>
“I
have
been
told
of
it
,
”
Mr.
Beard
replied
,
casting
down
his
eyes
,
for
it
was
painful
to
him
to
equivocate
.
<EOS>
“What
is
this
I
hear
?
”
<EOS>
Micklegift
exclaimed
,
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
“The
<EOS>
young
man
was
slain
at
Worcester
.
”
<EOS>
Stelfax
remarked
,
in
an
indifferent
tone
.
<EOS>
“That
can
not
be
!
”
<EOS>
the
Independent
minister
cried
.
<EOS>
“Wherefore
<EOS>
can
it
not
be
,
I
prithee
?
”
<EOS>
Stelfax
retorted
.
<EOS>
“
I
say
unto
thee
again
,
the
young
man
is
dead
and
buried
.
<EOS>
”“Thou
<EOS>
thinkest
<EOS>
so
?
”
said
Micklegift
.
<EOS>
“Nay
,
I
am
certain
of
it
,
”
the
other
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
There
is
small
chance
of
his
rendering
further
service
to
the
Young
Man
,
Charles
Stuart
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
speaking
of
your
daughter
,
sir
,
”
he
added
to
Mr.
Beard
.
<EOS>
“
She
deserves
a
good
husband
.
<EOS>
Have
you
ever
thought
of
giving
her
away
in
marriage?”“I
have
not
,
”
the
clergyman
replied
.
<EOS>
“
She
is
yet
of
tender
age
,
and
I
look
to
her
as
the
prop
of
my
declining
years
—
should
I
be
spared
.
<EOS>
”“But
<EOS>
you
know
not
what
may
befall
you
,
”
Stelfax
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
A
wise
man
will
provide
against
the
evil
day
.
<EOS>
”“Your
<EOS>
counsel
is
good
,
valiant
captain
,
”
Micklegift
remarked
.
<EOS>
“
And
Master
Beard
will
do
well
to
commit
his
daughter
to
the
care
of
some
godly
and
discreet
man
,
who
will
be
as
a
safeguard
to
her
.
<EOS>
”“Like
<EOS>
thyself
,
”
John
Habergeon
muttered
.
<EOS>
“Nay
,
were
I
Master
Beard
,
”
cried
Stelfax
,
“
I
would
rather
give
her
to
some
man
with
a
strong
hand
,
who
having
carved
his
way
with
the
sword
,
will
maintain
what
he
hath
won
with
the
same
weapon
.
<EOS>
”“What
!
<EOS>
is
this
Roundhead
captain
too
a
suitor
?
”
<EOS>
John
Habergeon
muttered
.
<EOS>
“
We
shall
have
the
pair
at
daggers
drawn
ere
<EOS>
long,”“This
man
is
my
rival
,
”
Micklegift
mentally
ejaculated
;
’
his
pale
features
flushing
angrily
.
<EOS>
“
I
must
thwart
his
designs
.
<EOS>
’“I
<EOS>
like
not
this
Independent
minister
,
”
Stelfax
muttered
to
himself
.
<EOS>
“
He
is
not
a
true
man
.
<EOS>
I
must
keep
an
eye
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Well
,
Master
Beard
,
”
he
added
,
aloud
,
to
the
clergyman—“are
you
disposed
to
follow
my
recommendation
,
and
bestow
fair
Mistress
Dulcia
upon
a
man
of
might
and
valour?”“Or
on
a
man
of
wisdom
and
godliness
?
”
<EOS>
Micklegift
said
.
<EOS>
“His
reverence
must
be
hard
put
to
it
to
answer
them
,
”
John
muttered
,
with
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
shall
leave
the
choice
to
my
daughter
,
”
the
clergyman
replied
,
gravely
;
“
and
until
she
consults
me
on
the
subject
,
I
shall
give
no
thought
to
it
.
<EOS>
”A
<EOS>
seasonable
relief
was
unexpectedly
offered
to
Mr.
Beard
at
this
juncture
.
<EOS>
A
great
disturbance
was
heard
in
the
corridor
,
and
the
next
moment
two
troopers
entered
,
dragging
in
Ninian
,
with
his
hands
bound
behind
his
back
with
a
leathern
thong
,
and
followed
by
Patty
Whinchat
,
sobbing
loudly
.
<EOS>
“How
<EOS>
now
,
Besadaiah
Eavestaff
,
and
thou
<EOS>
,
Tola
Fell
,
”
Stelfax
cried
,
addressing
the
troopers
,
“
what
hath
this
varlet
done
,
that
ye
bring
him
thus
bounden
before
me?”“He
hath
assaulted
our
comrade
,
Helpless
Henly
,
and
smitten
him
on
the
head
with
a
bill
-
staff
,
”
Besadaiah
replied
.
<EOS>
“Is
<EOS>
Helpless
Henly
much
hurt
?
”
<EOS>
Stelfax
demanded
.
<EOS>
“Nay
,
I
can
not
avouch
that
,
”
Besadaiah
replied
.
<EOS>
“
Luckily
,
he
hath
a
thick
skull
.
<EOS>
But
the
blow
was
delivered
with
right
good
will
,
and
felled
him
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
”“What
<EOS>
caused
the
attack
?
”
<EOS>
sternly
demanded
Stelfax
.
<EOS>
“I
was
the
unlucky
cause
of
it
,
an
please
you
,
worshipful
captain
,
”
sobbed
Patty
.
<EOS>
“
the
soldier
wanted
to
kiss
me
whether
I
would
or
not
;
so
I
cried
out
,
and
Ninian
came
to
my
assistance
,
and
—
and
—
that
was
all
.
<EOS>
”“No
<EOS>
,
not
quite
all
,
my
pretty
damsel

”
Stelfax
said
.
<EOS>
“
What
place
dost
thou
fill
in
the
establishment?”“That
of
handmaiden
to
Mistress
Dulcia

an
please
you

worshipful
captain

Patty
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“Mistress
Dulcia
is
well
served

I
warrant
her

”
Stelfax
remarked
,
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
“
Take
the
varlet
forth
,
”
he
added
to
the
troopers
,
“
and
belabour
him
soundly
with
your
scabbards
for
ten
minutes
.
”“Oh
,
spare
him!—spare
him
!
”
<EOS>
Patty
implored
,
throwing
herself
on
her
knees
before
the
captain
.
<EOS>
“Get
up
,
Patty
,
”
Ninian
cried
,
“
and
do
n’t
ask
pity
of
him
.
<EOS>
I
would
sooner
die
than
do
so
.
<EOS>
”“This
<EOS>
fellow
is
thy
sweetheart

as
the
phrase
goes
with
you
<EOS>
profane
folk
<EOS>
—
is
he
not

”
<EOS>
cried
Stelfax
.
<EOS>
“He
is
,
an
please
you
,
captain
.
<EOS>
Spare
him
!
<EOS>
spare
him
!
<EOS>
I
am
in
fault
,
not
he!”“Well
,
thou
hast
won
him
grace
,
”
Stelfax
replied
,
chucking
her
under
the
chin
.
<EOS>
“
I
marvel
not
that
Helpless
Henly
was
tempted
by
those
cherry
lips
.
<EOS>
Beshrew
me
,
but
thou
art
a
pretty
lass
—
almost
as
comely
as
thy
mistress
.
<EOS>
”“That
is
ever
the
way
with
the
captain
,
”
grumbled
Eavestaff
.
<EOS>
“
Like
Samson
the
Nazarite
,
the
son
of
Manoah
,
any
wanton
Delilah
can
prevail
over
him

<EOS>
Shall
we
unloose
the
varlet
’s
bonds?”“Yea
,
verily
,
”
Stelfax
replied
.
<EOS>
“
Yet
stay
!
”
<EOS>
he
continued
,
looking
hard
at
Ninian
.
<EOS>
“
This
must
be
the
knave
whom
I
encountered
with
the
malignant
colonel
,
at
the
foot
of
Kingston
Hill
.
<EOS>
There
must
have
been
a
strong
motive
for
his
expeditious
return
.
<EOS>
I
will
soon
find
it
out
,
”
he
muttered
to
himself
.
<EOS>
“
Render
an
account
of
thyself
,
fellow
.
<EOS>
Why
wert
thou
sent
on
by
thy
master?”“To
see
all
made
ready
for
you
,
captain
,
”
Ninian
answered
,
promptly
.
<EOS>
“I
have
no
doubt
of
it
,
”
Stelfax
remarked
,
drily
.
<EOS>
“
And
thou
hast
done
thy
best
to
carry
out
the
order
.
<EOS>
Wert
thou
to
get
thy
deserts
<EOS>
,
thou
shouldst
have
double
the
number
of
stripes
I
just
now
ordered
thee
;

thou
art
free

<EOS>
Thou
owest
thy
liberation
to
this
pretty
damsel
.
<EOS>
Let
him
not
out
of
your
sight
,
”
he
added
to
the
troopers
,
as
they
undid
the
thong
.
<EOS>
With
a
covert
glance
at
Ninian
,
which
seemed
to
say
<EOS>
“
Forget
not
what
I
have
just
done
for
you
!
”
<EOS>
Patty
Whinchat
hastily
disappeared
.
<EOS>
Filling
a
large
silver
flagon
,
holding
well
-
nigh
a
quart
,
with
Bordeaux
,
Stelfax
emptied
it
without
drawing
breath
;
pronounced
the
wine
good
;
and
then
,
getting
up
,
expressed
his
intention
of
forthwith
searching
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
ordered
John
Habergeon
and
Ninian
to
attend
him
,
but
made
no
objection
to
the
company
of
Mr.
Beard
and
Micklegift
,
who
proffered
to
go
with
him
.
<EOS>
Sergeant
Delves
and
the
two
troopers
brought
up
the
rear
.
<EOS>
Old
Martin
Geere
joined
the
party
in
the
hall
,
and
on
seeing
him
,
Stelfax
cried
out,“Go
fetch
thy
keys
quickly
,
thou
Pharaoh
’s
butler
.
<EOS>
I
will
have
every
room
and
every
closet
—
ay
,
and
every
secret
place
—
opened
unto
me
.
”“There
<EOS>
are
no
secret
places
that
I
wot
of
,
worshipful
captain
,
”
old
Martin
replied
.
<EOS>
“Thou
liest
!
”
<EOS>
Stelfax
exclaimed
,
fiercely
;
“
and
I
will
make
thee
show
them
to
me
,
or
thou
shalt
have
the
thumbscrew
.
<EOS>
”While
<EOS>
old
Martin
,
in
a
state
of
great
trepidation
,
hurried
off
to
obey
the
terrible
captain
’s
behest
,
the
latter
marched
into
the
library
,
and
glanced
around
it
,
making
contemptuous
observations
on
many
of
the
objects
that
met
his
view
.
<EOS>
He
had
just
finished
his
scrutiny
when
Martin
came
back
with
a
large
bunch
of
keys
.
<EOS>
“I
will
begin
with
the
ground
floor
,
”
Stelfax
said
.
<EOS>
“
Conduct
me
to
the
kitchen
and
cellars
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
old
serving
-
man
bowed
and
led
the
way
to
the
back
part
of
the
house
,
Stelfax
and
the
others
following
him
,
with
the
exception
of
Mr.
Beard
and
the
Independent
minister
,
who
stayed
in
the
entrance
-
hall
.
<EOS>
As
Stelfax
passed
the
buttery
,
he
perceived
half
a
dozen
troopers
seated
at
a
table
,
with
well
-
laden
trenchers
and
large
mugs
before
them
.
<EOS>
Amongst
them
was
a
great
brawny
-
looking
fellow
,
with
his
head
tied
up
with
a
napkin
,
through
which
the
blood
had
oozed
.
<EOS>
This
was
Helpless
Henly
.
<EOS>
To
judge
from
the
expeditious
manner
in
which
Henly
was
clearing
his
trencher
,
he
was
not
much
worse
for
his
broken
pate
.
<EOS>
On
seeing
Ninian
,
the
injured
Ironside
sprang
to
his
feet
,
and
drawing
his
tuck
from
its
scabbard
,
would
have
spitted
him
as
completely
as
the
jack
heron
had
recently
transfixed
the
poor
tartaret
,
but
for
the
interference
of
his
captain
,
who
ordered
the
fellow
to
sit
down
again
—
a
command
which
he
obeyed
with
ill-
concealed
discontent
,
and
muttered
threatenings
at
Ninian
.
<EOS>
The
next
visit
was
paid
to
the
kitchen
,
where
other
troopers
were
discovered
,
similarly
employed
to
those
in
the
buttery
.
<EOS>
A
brace
of
them
,
having
satisfied
their
appetites
,
were
seated
near
the
fire
,
smoking
their
pipes
,
and
watching
the
merry
movements
of
the
active
little
turnspit
in
his
box
.
<EOS>
Stelfax
tarried
no
longer
in
the
kitchen
than
allowed
him
time
to
number
the
household
,
and
put
a
few
questions
to
them
.
<EOS>
Next
came
the
cellar
.
<EOS>
A
short
flight
of
steps
conducted
the
searchers
into
an
extensive
range
of
vaults
with
strong
stone
walls
and
arches
calculated
to
sustain
the
weight
of
the
superincumbent
structure
.
<EOS>
Nothing
,
however
,
could
be
discovered
within
these
subterranean
chambers
more
dangerous
than
certain
hogsheads
of
ale
placed
within
the
arched
recesses
.
<EOS>
Nor
,
when
the
wine
cellars
were
unlocked
,
was
anything
to
be
discovered
except
a
goodly
supply
of
long-
necked
,
cobwebbed
flasks
quietly
reposing
in
their
bins
.
<EOS>
These
bottles
offered
too
strong
a
temptation
to
the
troopers
to
be
resisted
.
<EOS>
Each
of
them
,
including
Sergeant
Delves
,
took
toll
from
the
bins
,
carrying
off
a
plentiful
supply
for
themselves
and
their
comrades
.
<EOS>
No
notice
of
the
spoliation
was
taken
by
their
leader
.
<EOS>
The
cellar
doors
being
locked
,
the
searchers
returned
to
the
buttery
,
where
the
wine
was
put
aside
by
the
purloiners
for
future
consumption
,
and
this
precaution
taken
,
the
Roundhead
captain
intimated
his
intention
of
visiting
the
upper
rooms
.
<EOS>
Upon
which
,
they
repaired
to
the
entrance
-
hall
,
where
they
found
Mr.
Beard
and
Micklegift
,
and
after
examining
several
other
apartments
on
this
floor
,
the
whole
party
went
upstairs
.
<EOS>
Every
room
in
the
upper
story
,
large
and
small
—
with
one
exception
—
was
carefully
searched
;
every
closet
unlocked
;
<EOS>
every
place
,
likely
,
or
unlikely
,
to
conceal
a
fugitive
,
inspected
.
<EOS>
The
apartments
allotted
to
Mr.
Beard
and
his
daughter
underwent
the
same
rigorous
scrutiny
;
even
Dulcia
’s
sleeping
-
chamber
was
not
respected
.
<EOS>
In
this
latter
apartment
Patty
Whinchat
had
sought
refuge
,
hoping
to
escape
further
molestation
,
and
she
was
greatly
alarmed
when
Stelfax
and
the
Ironsides
burst
upon
her
retreat
.
<EOS>
The
Roundhead
captain
,
however
,
sought
to
reassure
her
,
and
thrusting
out
his
followers
,
claimed
a
kiss
as
the
reward
of
his
liberation
of
Ninian
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
Patty
could
not
refuse
the
request
.
<EOS>
Neither
did
she
exhibit
quite
so
much
disinclination
to
the
red-
bearded
captain
’s
salute
,
as
she
appeared
to
have
done
in
the
case
of
Helpless
Henly
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Maunsel
<EOS>
’s
chamber
was
reserved
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
Refusal
to
admit
the
searchers
within
it
would
have
instantly
awakened
suspicion
,
so
old
Martin
had
no
alternative
but
to
open
it
for
them
.
<EOS>
On
entering
the
room
,
Stelfax
uttered
an
exclamation
which
filled
John
Habergeon
with
misgiving
.
<EOS>
But
the
trusty
old
fellow
took
heart
when
the
searchers
marched
into
the
inner
room
,
and
proceeded
to
its
careful
examination
.
<EOS>
The
hangings
were
pulled
aside
;
the
old
oak
armoire
was
opened
;
the
closets
peered
into
—
but
nothing
was
found
.
<EOS>
John
began
to
hope
that
the
danger
was
over
.
<EOS>
But
all
his
fears
revived
when
Stelfax
,
throwing
himself
into
the
colonel
’s
elbow
-
chair
,
and
fixing
his
eyes
upon
the
great
mantelpiece
,
exclaimed
in
a
loud
voice
to
Sergeant
Delves
.
<EOS>
“Bring
<EOS>
hither
hammer
,
hatchet
,
lever
,
chisel
,
and
auger
.
<EOS>
I
have
work
for
you
to
do
.

How
Increase
<EOS>
MicklegiftDid
A
Turn
To
ClaveringAs
<EOS>
this
terrible
order
was
issued
,
and
the
sergeant
and
the
two
troopers
went
forth
to
execute
it
,
anxious
looks
were
furtively
exchanged
by
the
Royalists
,
who
now
gave
up
Clavering
for
lost
.
<EOS>
These
glances
did
not
escape
Stelfax
,
though
he
feigned
not
to
perceive
them
,
but
smiled
to
himself
.
<EOS>
For
one
moment
it
occurred
to
John
Habergeon
to
make
an
attack
upon
the
Roundhead
captain
,
and
by
the
sacrifice
of
his
own
life
possibly
ensure
Clavering
’s
escape
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
deterred
by
Mr.
Beard
,
who
,
reading
his
desperate
purpose
in
his
looks
,
laid
his
hand
upon
his
arm
,
and
besought
him
in
a
low
tone
to
forbear
.
<EOS>
Secretly
enjoying
the
consternation
he
had
occasioned
,
Stelfax
now
arose
from
the
chair
,
and
marched
to
the
window
as
if
to
look
out
at
the
garden
,
but
really
to
indulge
in
a
quiet
laugh
.
<EOS>
“If
<EOS>
we
could
only
get
him
out
of
the
room
for
one
minute
,
before
the
others
return
,
Captain
Clavering
might
be
saved
,
”
John
Haber
-
geon
whispered
.
<EOS>
“I
see
not
how
that
can
be
accomplished
,
”
groaned
Mr.
Beard
.
<EOS>
“
The
poor
young
man
is
lost
.
<EOS>
What
will
his
unhappy
father
say
when
he
returns?”“I
can
not
bear
to
think
of
it
,
”
John
returned
,
with
a
look
of
anguish
.
<EOS>
“
Cost
what
it
may
,
an
effort
must
be
made
to
save
him
.
<EOS>
”“I
may
help
you
in
this
extremity
,
”
said
Micklegift
,
in
a
low
tone
to
John
.
<EOS>
“
You
will
not
forget
the
service?”“Never
,
”
John
returned
,
emphatically—“never
!
<EOS>
But
what
you
do
must
be
done
quickly
.
<EOS>
”“Not
a
moment
<EOS>
shall
be
lost
on
my
part
,
”
Micklegift
rejoined
.
<EOS>
And
he
moved
towards
the
Roundhead
leader
.
<EOS>
“Methinks
<EOS>
you
did
not
sufficiently
examine
yon
further
closet
,
captain
,
”
Micklegift
observed
.
<EOS>
“
In
my
opinion
it
hath
a
false
back
.
<EOS>
”“You
must
have
quicker
eyes
than
I
have
,
to
have
made
that
discovery
,
Master
Preacher
,
”
Stelfax
cried
,
falling
at
once
into
the
snare
.
<EOS>
“
However
,
I
will
go
see
.
<EOS>
”“I
will
show
you
what
I
mean
,
”
said
the
Independent
divine
,
preceding
him
to
the
closet
.
<EOS>
As
he
entered
the
recess
with
Stelfax
,
the
Independent
divine
cast
a
significant
look
at
John
,
the
import
of
which
the
latter
at
once
comprehended
.
<EOS>
“Thou
<EOS>
art
lighter
of
foot
than
I
,
Ninian
,
”
he
said
to
the
young
falconer
.
<EOS>
“
Fly
to
yon
closet!—the
key
is
luckily
in
the
door
—
lock
them
in!—quick!”Ninian
needed
not
second
bidding
.
<EOS>
Stealing
swiftly
and
noiselessly
to
the
closet
-
door
,
he
clapped
it
to
suddenly
,
and
locked
it
,
almost
before
Captain
Stelfax
,
who
was
at
the
further
end
of
the
deep
recess
,
could
turn
round
.
<EOS>
Infuriated
at
the
successful
trick
played
upon
him
,
the
Roundhead
leader
dashed
himself
with
all
his
force
against
the
door
;
but
it
was
of
solid
oak
,
and
resisted
his
efforts
.
<EOS>
He
then
roared
out
to
the
Royalists
to
set
him
instantly
free
,
threatening
them
with
his
direst
vengeance
if
they
refused
;
but
so
far
from
attending
to
him
,
Ninian
very
coolly
took
the
key
out
of
the
lock
,
saying
,
with
a
laugh
,
“
If
you
wait
till
I
let
you
loose
,
captain
,
you
will
wait
long
enough
.
<EOS>
”Meantime
,
John
Habergeon
had
not
been
idle
.
<EOS>
So
soon
as
Stelfax
was
secured
,
he
rushed
to
the
mantelpiece
,
touched
the
secret
spring
,
and
putting
his
head
into
the
aperture
,
called
to
Clavering
to
come
forth
without
an
instant
’s
delay
.
<EOS>
The
young
man
at
once
obeyed
the
summons
.
<EOS>
The
noise
made
by
the
searchers
had
reached
him
in
his
retreat
,
and
guessing
the
cause
,
he
prepared
to
stand
upon
his
defence
,
resolved
not
to
surrender
with
life
.
<EOS>
Happily
,
his
resolution
was
not
put
to
the
test
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
words
John
Habergeon
explained
to
him
what
had
occurred
.
<EOS>
But
though
he
was
free
,
escape
might
be
rendered
impracticable
by
the
return
of
the
troopers
.
<EOS>
What
was
to
be
done
next
?
<EOS>
To
get
out
of
the
house
seemed
almost
impossible
.
<EOS>
Every
outlet
,
as
John
knew
,
was
guarded
.
<EOS>
Still
,
something
must
be
done
—
and
quickly
.
<EOS>
No
mercy
was
now
to
be
expected
from
the
maddened
Roundhead
leader
,
who
was
hammering
and
hacking
at
the
door
with
his
sword
,
and
making
a
terrific
disturbance
.
<EOS>
John
’s
brain
was
usually
fertile
in
expedients
,
but
he
was
at
his
wits
’
<EOS>
end
now
,
when
Ninian
,
coming
up
to
them
,
recalled
his
energies
.
<EOS>
“Why
do
you
loiter
?
”
<EOS>
the
young
falconer
cried
,
impatiently
“
Those
cursed
troopers
will
be
back
in
a
moment
,
and
Captain
Clavering
will
be
caught
.
<EOS>
”“But
all
the
doors
are
guarded
!
”
<EOS>
John
cried
.
<EOS>
“Except
<EOS>
the
door
of
this
room
,
and
that
will
serve
our
turn
,
”
Ninian
answered
,
with
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
“
Come
with
me
,
and
I
will
show
you
how
to
get
out
of
the
house
,
in
spite
of
them
.
<EOS>
”“Have
with
you
then
,
”
cried
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“
Will
you
not
come
with
us
,
sir
?
”
<EOS>
he
added
to
Mr.
Beard
.
<EOS>
“No
,
my
dear
son
,
”
the
clergyman
said
.
<EOS>
“
Do
you
seek
safety
in
flight
;
I
will
abide
here
.
<EOS>
”“You
had
better
come
,
reverend
sir
,
”
John
cried
.
<EOS>
“
Yon
savage
Roundhead
is
no
respecter
of
persons
,
and
will
show
little
consideration
for
your
holy
calling
.
<EOS>
”“I
will
withstand
his
malice
,
”
Mr.
Beard
answered
,
resignedly
.
<EOS>
“
Do
not
concern
yourselves
about
me
.
<EOS>
Go!—and
<EOS>
Heaven
guard
you!”“Quick
!
<EOS>
quick
!
<EOS>
or
you
will
be
too
late
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Ninian
,
who
had
partly
opened
the
door
.
<EOS>
“
Methinks
I
hear
them
coming
.
<EOS>
”“Make
<EOS>
sure
that
we
may
venture
forth
,
”
cried
Clavering
.
<EOS>
Ninian
stepped
out
into
the
gallery
,
and
reported
that
no
one
was
there
,
but
that
he
could
hear
the
voices
of
the
troopers
in
the
hall
below
.
<EOS>
On
this
assurance
,
Clavering
and
John
Habergeon
instantly
went
forth
,
closing
the
door
after
them
.
<EOS>
Left
alone
,
the
good
clergyman
sat
down
,
and
strove
to
prepare
himself
for
the
scene
which
he
expected
to
ensue
.
<EOS>
All
the
time
,
Stelfax
continued
battering
at
the
closet
door
,
and
vociferating
loudly
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
,
Sergeant
Delves
and
the
two
troopers
entered
the
room
,
bearing
the
implements
for
breaking
open
the
mantelpiece
.
<EOS>
They
were
surprised
on
seeing
only
Mr.
Beard
,
and
at
a
loss
to
account
for
their
leader
’s
disappearance
,
for
Stelfax
had
momentarily
ceased
his
clamour
—
probably
from
exhaustion
.
<EOS>
However
,
he
presently
renewed
it
,
and
with
greater
fury
than
ever
,
and
then
Sergeant
Delves
,
beginning
to
comprehend
what
had
occurred
,
rushed
up
to
the
clergyman
,
and
,
seizing
his
shoulder
,
shook
him
violently
,
exclaiming,“What
!
<EOS>
thou
perfidious
and
dissembling
Episcopalian
,
hast
thou
entrapped
our
leader
,
a
mighty
man
of
valour
like
Amasiah
,
the
captain
of
Jehoshaphat
,
and
fastened
him
within
yon
closet
?
<EOS>
Give
me
the
key
thereof
instantly
,
or
I
will
smite
thee
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
,
even
as
the
false
priests
of
Baal
were
put
to
death
by
the
soldiers
of
Jehu
.
”“To
<EOS>
do
me
injury
<EOS>
will
advance
thee
little
,
friend
,
”
replied
Mr.
Beard
,
firmly
.
<EOS>
“
I
have
not
the
key
.
<EOS>
Thou
wert
better
liberate
thy
captain
thyself
.
<EOS>
Thou
hast
the
means
of
doing
so
.
<EOS>
”Apparently
,
the
sergeant
thought
the
advice
good
,
for
he
called
out
to
Captain
Stelfax
that
assistance
was
at
hand
,
which
had
the
effect
of
tranquillizing
him
.
<EOS>
Delves
next
directed
his
men
to
burst
open
the
door
—
a
task
which
they
easily
accomplished
.
<EOS>
Thus
liberated
,
the
Roundhead
captain
strode
forth
,
sword
in
hand
,
and
foaming
with
rage
,
followed
by
Micklegift
,
who
maintained
the
most
perfect
composure
.
<EOS>
“‘Tis
as
I
expected
!
”
<EOS>
Stelfax
cried
,
looking
around
,
and
seeming
only
Mr.
Beard
;
“
the
treacherous
rogues
have
fled
.
<EOS>
But
they
shall
not
escape
me
.
<EOS>
They
can
not
have
quitted
the
house
.
”“Impossible
,
captain
,
”
Sergeant
Delves
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
Every
issue
is
guarded
.
<EOS>
”“We
<EOS>
will
have
them
,
alive
or
dead
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Stelfax
.
<EOS>
“
Get
thee
downstairs
quickly
,
Delves
,
and
give
the
alarm
to
thy
comrades
.
<EOS>
Bid
them
be
on
the
alert
.
<EOS>
If
any
one
attempts
to
escape
,
let
him
be
shot
down
.
<EOS>
Bring
up
half
a
dozen
men
with
you
.
<EOS>
We
will
search
the
house
from
top
to
bottom
but
we
will
find
them
.
<EOS>
Some
one
must
have
been
concealed
within
this
chamber
—
perchance
the
Young
Man
,
Charles
Stuart
,
himself
.
<EOS>
”“Ha
!
<EOS>
say
you
so
,
captain
?
”
<EOS>
Delves
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
“
That
were
a
prize
,
indeed!”“Nay
,
‘
tis
mere
conjecture
,
”
Stelfax
rejoined
,
somewhat
hastily
.
<EOS>
“
Yet
‘
tis
certain
one
has
been
hidden
here
.
<EOS>
Away
with
thee
downstairs
,
and
leave
me
to
question
this
Episcopalian
preacher
.
<EOS>
”And
<EOS>
as
Delves
departed
,
the
Roundhead
captain
marched
up
to
Mr.
Beard
,
and
shaking
him
as
roughly
as
the
sergeant
had
done
,
fiercely
demanded
who
had
been
concealed
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
“I
will
answer
no
questions
,
”
Mr.
Beard
replied
,
meekly
but
firmly
;
“
<EOS>
so
you
may
spare
yourself
the
trouble
of
interrogating
me
.
<EOS>
”“I
will
find
a
way
of
making
thee
speak
,
thou
perverse
and
purblind
zealot
,
”
Stelfax
roared
.
<EOS>
“
Think
not
I
will
show
thee
mercy
because
of
thy
comely
daughter
.
<EOS>
Thou
shalt
undergo
the
torture
.
<EOS>
My
men
shall
put
jagged
rings
upon
thy
limbs
that
shall
pierce
deeply
into
the
flesh
.
<EOS>
Thy
legs
shall
be
thrust
into
an
iron
boot
that
shall
crush
bone
and
marrow
,
and
make
thee
lame
for
life
.
<EOS>
”“All
<EOS>
this
you
may
do
,
and
more
,
as
your
savage
nature
may
suggest
,
”
the
clergyman
said
,
firmly
;
“
yet
shall
you
not
force
me
speak
.
<EOS>
”“We
<EOS>
shall
see
presently
,
”
Stelfax
cried
.
<EOS>

made

“
I

no

”“Hold

Micklegift
interposed
.
<EOS>
“
I

not

<EOS>
”“Thou

<EOS>
Stelfax
exclaimed

in

In

Withdraw

Micklegift
cried

resolutely

I
lift

”“I

Micklegift

The

hesitated

not

<EOS>
At
this
moment
the
door
opened

and
Colonel
Maunsel

Dulcia
entered
the

<EOS>
The
old
Cavalier
looked
pale
as
death
,
and
greatly
agitated
.
<EOS>
He
cast
an
anxious
look
around

as

apprehensive

Dulcia
was
equally
alarmed

“My

news
travels
quickly
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Maunsel
was
warned
of
the
danger
awaiting
him
,
long
before
he
reached
the
Grange
.
<EOS>
Some
half
-
dozen
loyal
villagers
mounting
the
down
at
the
rear
of
the
mansion
,
stationed
themselves
near
the
old
barrow
,
and
as
soon
as
they
descried
the
little
party
descending
the
gorse-
coloured
slopes
of
the
furthest
hill
on
the
north
-
west
,
they
ran
to
meet
the
colonel
,
and
gave
him
the
alarming
intelligence
that
his
habitation
was
in
the
hands
of
the
Ironsides
,
every
door
guarded
,
and
no
one
allowed
to
come
forth
.
<EOS>
The
faithful
rustics
,
of
course
,
were
unable
to
state
what
had
taken
place
inside
the
house
,
or
what
discoveries
had
been
made
,
but
enough
was
related
to
fill
the
colonel
with
deepest
disquietude:—the
only
relief
to
his
anxiety
being
afforded
by
the
certitude
which
he
likewise
derived
from
his
informants
that
Ninian
had
reached
the
Grange
before
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
On
approaching
Ovingdean
,
the
loyal
rustics
took
leave
of
the
old
Cavalier
and
Dulcia
,
who
proceeded
to
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
Dismounting
at
the
porch
,
and
giving
their
horses
to
Eustace
Saxby
,
they
both
went
in
,
no
hindrance
being
offered
by
the
sentinels
posted
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
Old
Martin
Geere
met
them
in
the
entrance
-
hall
—
his
wobegone
looks
announcing
disaster
.
<EOS>
The
old
serving
-
man
,
we
may
remark
,
dreading
lest
he
should
betray
himself
by
some
indiscreet
observation
,
had
quitted
the
colonel
’s
chamber
before
Stelfax
was
entrapped
by
the
agency
of
Micklegift
,
and
consequently
he
could
give
no
account
of
that
occurrence
,
or
what
had
followed
it
;
but
he
knew
enough
to
heighten
his
master
’s
and
Dulcia
’s
alarm
,
and
fearing
the
worst
—
the
worst
with
them
being
the
discovery
of
Clavering
’s
hiding
-
place
—
they
hurried
upstairs
,
entering
the
room
,
as
previously
narrated
,
at
the
moment
when
.
<EOS>
Increase
Micklegift
interposed
to
prevent
Mr.
Beard
from
undergoing
the
torture
.
<EOS>
Their
entrance
operated
as
a
check
upon
the
threatened
violence
.
<EOS>
At
the
sight
of
Dulcia
,
Stelfax
,
by
a
sudden
effort
,
constrained
his
wrath
;
while
the
two
troopers
involuntarily
drew
back
as
the
shrieking
maiden
rushed
up
to
Mr.
Beard
,
and
flung
her
arms
around
his
neck
.
<EOS>
“What
would
these
barbarous
men
do
to
you
,
my
father
?
”
<EOS>
she
asked
.
<EOS>
“They
would
torture
him
,
”
Micklegift
replied
,
answering
for
Mr.
Beard
,
whose
agitation
almost
deprived
him
of
the
power
of
utterance
.
<EOS>
“Torture
an
unoffending
clergyman
—
an
old
man
—
impossible
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Dulcia
,
in
an
agonized
voice
.
<EOS>
“
Cruel
as
they
are
,
they
can
not
mean
it
.
<EOS>
They
must
have
some
respect
for
religion
—
some
reverence
for
grey
hairs
.
<EOS>
”“Alas
!
<EOS>
they
have
none
,
my
child
,
”
Mr.
Beard
observed
.
<EOS>
“
Neither
my
age
nor
my
sacred
calling
would
have
protected
me
from
outrage
,
but
for
this
good
man
’s
interposition
.
”
<EOS>
And
,
as
he
spoke
,
he
cast
a
grateful
look
at
Micklegift
.
<EOS>
“Is
<EOS>
this
so
?
”
<EOS>
cried
Dulcia
to
Stelfax
.
<EOS>
“
Do
you
still
hold
to
your
savage
purpose?”“Nay
,
I
meant
but
to
work
upon
thy
father
’s
fears
,
damsel
,
and
so
extort
a
confession
from
him
,
”
the
Ironside
captain
replied
.
<EOS>
“
I
did
not
design
to
proceed
to
extremities
with
him
.
”“Heaven
<EOS>
alone
can
read
our
secret
thoughts
,
”
observed
Micklegift
,
in
a
tone
of
incredulity
.
<EOS>
“
But
thy
part
was
so
well
played
,
that
at
least
it
imposed
upon
me
.
<EOS>
”Stelfax
<EOS>
bent
his
brows
,
but
took
no
other
notice
of
the
observation
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Maunsel
had
not
hitherto
spoken
,
but
had
looked
on
in
the
utmost
anxiety
,
being
ignorant
,
of
course
,
of
his
son
’s
evasion
.
<EOS>
He
now
addressed
himself
to
Stelfax
,
in
the
hope
of
eliciting
some
information
from
him
.
<EOS>
“You
<EOS>
spoke
of
confession
,
sir
<EOS>
,
”
he
said
to
the
Roundhead
leader
.
<EOS>
“
What
hath
<EOS>
Mr.
Beard
to
reveal?”“You
shall
learn
presently
,
Colonel
Maunsel
,
”
the
other
rejoined
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
“Nay
,
he
shall
learn
at
once
,
”
Micklegift
interposed
.
<EOS>
“
The
valiant
captain
hath
been
locked
in
yonder
closet
,
and
waxing
wroth
at
his
confinement
,
he
visited
his
anger
on
Master
Beard
’s
head
,
charging
the
unoffending
old
man
with
aiding
a
fugitive
to
escape
.
<EOS>
”“How
<EOS>
know’st
<EOS>
thou
Master
Beard
is
unoffending
?
”
<EOS>
Stelfax
cried
.
<EOS>
“
Thou
wert
shut
up
with
me
in
the
closet
,
and
couldst
not
tell
what
took
place
.
”“Ha
!
”
<EOS>
the
old
Cavalier
exclaimed
,
a
sudden
light
breaking
upon
him
.
<EOS>
“The
valiant
captain
seems
to
suspect
that
a
proscribed
malignant
hath
been
concealed
within
this
room
,
”
Micklegift
continued
,
with
a
significant
look
at
Colonel
Maunsel
.
<EOS>
“I
am
certain
of
it
,
”
the
Roundhead
leader
returned
;
“
and
I
begin
to
suspect
it
was
by
thy
instrumentality
,
master
preacher
,
that
he
hath
escaped
.
<EOS>
”“How
<EOS>
could
that
be
,
seeing
I
was
with
thee
in
the
closet
?
”
<EOS>
Micklegift
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“It
might
easily
be
—
since
it
was
by
thy
device
that
I
was
led
into
the
snare
.
<EOS>
Bitterly
shalt
thou
rue
it
,
if
I
find
thee
leagued
with
the
Amalekites
.
<EOS>
”“Let
<EOS>
it
be
proven
that
I
am
leagued
with
them
,
”
Micklegift
rejoined
,
“
and
I
will
abide
any
punishment
thou
mayst
choose
to
inflict
upon
me
.
”“Proof
<EOS>
that
thou
art
in
concert
with
the
enemies
of
the
Commonwealth
may
appear
hereafter
,
”
Stelfax
retorted
.
<EOS>
“
Meantime
,
I
have
a
question
to
put
to
you
,
Colonel
Maunsel
,
whereunto
<EOS>
I
demand
a
distinct
answer
.
<EOS>
Hath
Amon
,
the
son
of
Manasseh
,
whose
provocations
kindled
the
wrath
of
the
Lord
God
against
Judah
—
hath
Amon
,
I
say
,
taken
refuge
in
thy
house?”“I
<EOS>
will
not
feign
to
misunderstand
you
,
”
the
old
Cavalier
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
But
were
it
as
you
suspect
,
think
you
I
would
betray
him?”“You
prevaricate
,
and
convert
my
doubts
into
certainties
,
”
cried
Stelfax
.
<EOS>
“
The
Young
Man
hath
been
here
—
nay
,
is
here
still
—
for
he
can
not
have
eluded
the
vigilance
of
the
sentinels
.
<EOS>
Are
you
aware
,
Colonel
Maunsel
,
that
a
Proclamation
was
posted
this
morning
at
your
gate
,
to
the
effect
that
whosoever
shall
harbour
Charles
Stuart
shall
be
held
guilty
of
high
treason
?
<EOS>
Did
you
read
that
Proclamation?”“I
did
,
and
would
have
trampled
it
beneath
my
feet
.
<EOS>
”“The
punishment
of
high
treason
is
death
,
colonel
—
death
on
the
scaffold
!
<EOS>
Forget
not
that
,
”
Stelfax
said
.
<EOS>
“I
shall
but
die
as
my
Master
died
,
if
I
so
perish
,
”
the
old
Cavalier
rejoined
.
<EOS>
Just
then
,
Sergeant
Delves
entered
the
room
,
and
the
half
-
opened
door
afforded
a
glimpse
of
several
other
troopers
standing
without
in
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
“The
men
await
your
orders
,
captain
,
”
said
the
sergeant
,
advancing
towards
his
leader
.
<EOS>
“It
is
well
,
”
Stelfax
answered
.
<EOS>
“
Before
I
proceed
to
the
search
Colonel
Maunsel
,
it
is
right
you
should
know
that
two
of
your
retainers
,
John
Habergeon
and
Ninian
Saxby
by
name
,
have
aided
and
abetted
in
this
attempted
escape
of
a
concealed
traitor
and
enemy
to
the
Commonwealth
.
<EOS>
If
they
fall
into
my
hands
I
shall
show
them
little
grace
.
”“Heaven
<EOS>
grant
them
a
deliverance
!
”
<EOS>
murmured
the
colonel
.
<EOS>
“And
<EOS>
now
,
”
continued
Stelfax
,
“
I
must
see
the
hiding
-
place
within
yon
chimney
.
<EOS>
Will
you
show
me
the
entrance
to
it
voluntarily
,
or
must
my
men
break
down
the
mantelpiece
?
<EOS>
See
it
I
will
.
<EOS>
”Colonel
<EOS>
Maunsel
hesitated
,
uncertain
how
to
act
.
<EOS>
“Advance
,
men
—
to
your
task
!
”
<EOS>
Stelfax
said
.
<EOS>
“Hold
!
”
<EOS>
the
colonel
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
And
stepping
towards
the
hearth
,
he
touched
the
secret
spring
,
and
the
pillar
flew
back
.
<EOS>
“An
<EOS>
ingenious
contrivance
,
truly
,
”
cried
Stelfax
,
with
a
laugh
;
“
but
you
must
have
a
better
device
than
this
to
delude
me
.
<EOS>
Give
me
thy
pistol
,
sergeant
,
”
he
continued
,
taking
the
weapon
from
Delves
.
<EOS>
“
I
will
go
in
myself
.
<EOS>
Guard
thou
the
entrance
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
be
entrapped
a
second
time
.
”
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
stepped
into
the
recess
,
while
Delves
planted
himself
outside
it
.
<EOS>
Nothing
was
said
during
the
brief
absence
of
the
Ironside
leader
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Maunsel
,
though
almost
confident
of
his
son
’s
escape
,
was
not
wholly
free
from
uneasiness
,
while
Dulcia
glanced
anxiously
and
inquiringly
at
her
father
,
who
strove
to
reassure
her
with
his
looks
.
<EOS>
In
another
moment
,
Stelfax
came
forth
again
.
<EOS>
“The
bird
has
flown
,
”
he
said
,
“
but
the
nest
is
yet
warm
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
be
far
off
.
<EOS>
”“The
fugitives
can
not
have
left
the
house
,
captain
—
of
that
I
am
certain
,
”
Delves
remarked
.
<EOS>
“
No
one
has
come
down
stairs
.
<EOS>
”“We
<EOS>
shall
discover
them
,
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
,
”
Stelfax
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
Visit
yon
inner
chamber
once
more
,
and
then
we
will
search
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
sergeant
did
as
directed
,
and
made
a
rigorous
but
unsuccessful
investigation
of
the
apartment
.
<EOS>
“I
did
not
expect
any
one
would
be
found
there
,
”
Stelfax
said
;
“
but
nothing
must
be
neglected
.
<EOS>
You
,
Colonel
Maunsel
,
and
all
of
you
,
”
he
continued
,
“
will
remain
prisoners
for
the
present
within
this
chamber
—
with
the
exception
of
Master
Increase
Micklegift
,
who
is
at
liberty
to
depart
.
<EOS>
”“Nay
,
I
will
tarry
where
I
am
,
”
the
Independent
minister
rejoined
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
,
Stelfax
seemed
disposed
to
insist
upon
his
departure
,
but
,
changing
his
mind
,
he
exclaimed
,
“
Tarry
here
if
thou
wilt
.
<EOS>
Sentinels
will
be
placed
at
the
door
,
and
will
suffer
no
one
to
go
forth
.
<EOS>
”Upon
<EOS>
this
,
he
quitted
the
room
with
Delves
,
and
the
door
was
closed
upon
the
prisoners
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
this
was
done
,
Micklegift
approached
the
old
Cavalier
,
and
said
to
him
,
“
Not
altogether
unjustly
did
yon
man
of
wrath
tax
me
with
leaguing
with
your
party
.
<EOS>
Your
son
owes
his
safety
to
me
.
<EOS>
But
for
my
timely
aid
he
would
be
now
in
the
hands
of
his
enemies
,
and
you
are
aware
how
he
would
have
been
dealt
with
.
<EOS>
”“It
<EOS>
is
quite
true
,
worthy
sir
,
”
Mr.
Beard
subjoined
.
<EOS>
“
Good
Master
Micklegift
must
be
regarded
as
your
son
’s
preserver
,
as
he
has
since
been
my
defender
from
violence
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
thank
you
from
my
heart
,
sir
,
”
the
colonel
said
,
warmly
.
<EOS>
“
I
have
been
much
mistaken
in
you
.
”“Thank
<EOS>
the
worthy
man
,
my
child
,
”
Mr.
Beard
said
to
Dulcia
.
<EOS>
“
We
are
all
greatly
beholden
to
him
.
<EOS>
”“He
<EOS>
has
my
thanks
,
”
Dulcia
replied
,
unable
to
overcome
her
strong
aversion
to
Micklegift
;
“
and
I
trust
he
has
been
influenced
by
good
motives
in
what
he
has
done
.
<EOS>
”“Why
<EOS>
should
you
mistrust
him
,
my
child
?
”
<EOS>
her
father
remarked
,
somewhat
severely
.
<EOS>
“Ay
,
wherefore
shouldst
thou
doubt
me
,
maiden
?
”
<EOS>
Micklegift
said
,
in
a
half-
reproachful
tone
,
And
bending
his
head
towards
her
,
he
whispered
,
“
This
have
I
done
for
thy
sake
—
and
I
will
do
yet
more
,
if
thou
dost
desire
it
.
”Dulcia
made
no
reply
,
but
cast
her
eyes
upon
the
ground
.
<EOS>
“Take
comfort
,
worthy
sir
,
I
entreat
you
,
”
Mr.
Beard
said
,
noticing
that
the
colonel
seemed
still
a
prey
to
keen
anxiety
.
<EOS>
“
All
may
yet
be
well
.
<EOS>
”“Not
till
I
am
assured
of
my
son
<EOS>
’s
<EOS>
safety
<EOS>
shall
I
feel
relief
,
”
the
old
Cavalier
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
Little
has
yet
been
gained
.
<EOS>
‘
Tis
a
mere
escape
from
one
room
to
another
.
<EOS>
Flight
from
the
house
,
guarded
as
it
is
,
is
next
to
impossible
,
and
I
know
not
where
concealment
can
be
found
within
doors
.
”“Concealment
<EOS>
will
not
be
attempted
,
I
apprehend
,
sir
,
”
Mr.
Beard
remarked
.
<EOS>
“
Ninian
seemed
confident
of
getting
out
of
the
house
secretly
.
<EOS>
”“Did
<EOS>
he
so
?
<EOS>
”
cried
the
colonel
.
<EOS>
“
Then
I
have
better
hopes
.
<EOS>
Some
plan
may
have
occurred
to
him
which
does
not
occur
to
me
.
<EOS>
Hist!—did
you
not
hear
a
noise?”“Only
the
trampling
of
heavy
feet
as
the
Roundhead
soldiers
move
from
chamber
to
chamber
,
”
Mr.
Beard
replied
.
<EOS>
“
Pray
Heaven
your
son
<EOS>
escape
<EOS>
them!”“Heaven
,
in
its
mercy
,
shield
him
!
”
<EOS>
Dulcia
cried
.
<EOS>
“The
noise
grows
louder
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
colonel
.
<EOS>
“
A
struggle
seems
to
be
taking
place
in
the
room
overhead
.
<EOS>
”Unable
<EOS>
to
repress
an
ejaculation
of
terror
,
Dulcia
fell
upon
her
knees
,
and
prayed
audibly
.
<EOS>
“Methinks
<EOS>
the
sound
comes
from
the
chimney
!
”
<EOS>
Micklegift
cried
.
<EOS>
“From
the
chimney
!
”
<EOS>
the
colonel
exclaimed
,
advancing
towards
the
fireplace
,
followed
by
the
Independent
minister
.
<EOS>
“
You
are
right
.
<EOS>
Some
one
is
coming
down
,
”
he
added
,
stooping
to
look
up
the
chimney
-
funnel
.
<EOS>
“
Who
is
there?”“A
friend
,
”
replied
the
voice
of
Ninian
.
<EOS>
“
Is
the
coast
clear
?
<EOS>
May
we
come
down?”“Powers
of
mercy
!
”
<EOS>
the
old
Cavalier
ejaculated
.
<EOS>
“
Can
it
be
?
<EOS>
Is
my
son
there?”“It
is
the
colonel
who
speaks
,
”
Ninian
said
,
evidently
addressing
some
one
above
him
.
<EOS>
“
Yes
,
yes
,
the
captain
is
here
.
<EOS>
Is
all
safe
below?”“It
is
—
yet
stay
!
<EOS>
those
ruthless
Ironsides
may
return
!
”
<EOS>
the
old
Cavalier
cried
.
<EOS>
But
before
the
latter
part
of
his
exclamation
could
be
uttered
,
Ninian
dropped
lightly
on
the
hearth
.
<EOS>
A
glance
satisfied
the
young
falconer
that
all
was
secure
.
<EOS>
He
turned
,
therefore
,
and
calling
up
the
funnel
,
“
You
may
come
down
,
captain
,
”
assisted
another
individual
to
descend
,
and
in
a
trice
Clavering
stood
before
his
father
.
<EOS>
“My
son
!
<EOS>
my
dear
son
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
colonel
,
transported
with
delight
at
beholding
him
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
had
Clavering
and
Ninian
quitted
the
hearth
than
John
Habergeon
landed
in
safety
,
and
stepped
out
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
Clavering
and
Dulcia
were
together
—
the
latter
weeping
with
delight
on
the
young
man
’s
shoulder
.
<EOS>
“The
enemy
are
searching
the
house
for
you
,
”
Dulcia
cried
.
<EOS>
How
did
you
manage
to
escape
them?”“Hush!—not
so
loud
,
”
Micklegift
said
,
stepping
softly
towards
the
door
;
“
you
will
be
overheard
by
the
sentinels
.
<EOS>
”“We
<EOS>
put
ourselves
under
the
guidance
of
Ninian
,
”
Clavering
said
,
in
reply
to
Dulcia
’s
inquiry
,
“
and
by
his
aid
got
upon
the
roof
,
and
so
reached
this
chimney
,
which
he
declared
had
holdings
with
inside
for
the
feet
by
which
we
could
descend
.
<EOS>
It
turned
out
as
he
stated
;
but
the
descent
would
have
been
impracticable
on
my
part
,
helpless
as
I
am
,
but
for
John
Habergeon
’s
support
.
<EOS>
We
meant
to
lurk
within
the
chimney
till
the
search
should
be
over
,
when
Ninian
heard
my
father
’s
voice
—
and
so
here
we
are
.
<EOS>
”“But
<EOS>
here
you
must
not
remain
,
”
said
the
colonel
.
<EOS>
“
The
baffled
Ironsides
may
return
at
any
moment
.
<EOS>
What
is
to
be
done?”“Can
<EOS>
we
not
conceal
ourselves
behind
the
hangings
in
the
inner
room
?
”
<EOS>
cried
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“
One
of
us
might
take
refuge
in
the
armoire
.
<EOS>
”“No
<EOS>
,
no
!
<EOS>
that
would
be
too
dangerous
!
”
<EOS>
John
Habergeon
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
“
Could
we
but
reach
the
garden!—That
window
is
a
good
height
from
the
ground
,
it
is
true
,
but
I
could
drop
from
it
and
break
no
bones
—
and
so
could
Ninian
—
<EOS>
but
the
fall
would
n’t
suit
<EOS>
Captain
Clavering
’s
injured
arm
.
”“Think
<EOS>
not
of
me
,
John
,
”
the
young
Cavalier
cried
,
resolutely
.
<EOS>
“
I
am
ready
to
make
the
attempt
.
”“It
would
be
useless
,
”
Ninian
said
,
cautiously
approaching
the
window
and
looking
forth
;
“
there
is
a
red
-
coat
,
with
a
musket
on
his
shoulder
,
on
guard
below
.
<EOS>
”“Pest
<EOS>
on
him
!
”
<EOS>
John
ejaculated
.
<EOS>
“
We
must
e’en
climb
the
chimney
again
.
<EOS>
”“So
<EOS>
it
seems
,
”
cried
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“Be
ruled
by
me
,
and
enter
the
hiding
-
place
in
which
you
originally
took
refuge
,
”
said
Micklegift
,
advancing
towards
them
.
<EOS>
“The
<EOS>
captain
of
the
Ironsides
has
already
searched
it
,
and
will
not
,
in
all
likelihood
,
visit
it
again
.
<EOS>
”“The
worthy
man
speaks
the
truth
!
”
<EOS>
Colonel
Maunsel
exclaimed
.
“
<EOS>
‘
Tis
the
safest
place
to
be
found

<EOS>
We
are
beholden
to
you
for
the

Master
Micklegift

<EOS>
Enter
the
recess

my
son
.
”“Do
<EOS>
not
go
there
,
”
Dulcia
cried
,
detaining
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“
I
distrust
this
man
.
<EOS>
He
will
betray
you
.
”“Since
<EOS>
you
doubt
me
,
damsel

”
said
Micklegift
,
“
let
the
youth
stay
here
,
and
be
the
consequences
on
your
head
.
<EOS>
He
will
not
have
to
tarry
long
,
for
methinks
I
hear
the
footsteps
of
his
foe
without
.
<EOS>
”“Why
<EOS>
do
you
keep
him
back
,
Dulcia
?
”
<EOS>
the
colonel
cried
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
“
Worthy
Master
Micklegift
is
perfectly
right
,
and
I
owe
him
a
large
debt
of
gratitude
for
twice
saving
my
son
.
”“Spare
<EOS>
your
thanks
,
Colonel
Maunsel
,
till
the
danger
be
past
,
”
the
Independent
minister
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
Seek
the
refuge
I
have
pointed
out
to
you
,
young
man
—
or
stay
and
brave
your
fate
.
<EOS>
But
hesitate
not
.
<EOS>
In
another
moment
you
will
have
no
choice
left
.
<EOS>
”“I
was
wrong!—go!—go
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Dulcia
to
Clavering
,
who
still
looked
irresolute
.
<EOS>
At
her
entreaty
he
moved
towards
the
hiding
-
place
,
the
entrance
to
which
had
already
been
thrown
open
by
Ninian
,
who
had
gone
in
.
<EOS>
John
Habergeon
stood
outside
on
the
hearth
.
<EOS>
“Come
!
<EOS>
come
!
<EOS>
captain
,
”
the
old
trooper
cried
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
One
would
think
you
were
desirous
of
being
captured
.
<EOS>
In
with
you!”Upon
this
,
Clavering
entered
the
recess
,
and
John
quickly
following
him
,
the
pillar
swung
back
to
its
customary
position
.
<EOS>
IllustrationCHAPTER
IIHow
Mickelgift
<EOS>
Was
Ignominiously
Expelled
From
The
GrangeSCARCELY
<EOS>
had
all
been
made
secure
,
when
the
chamber
-
door
suddenly
opened
,
and
a
sentinel
entering
,
cast
a
sharp
inquisitive
look
around
.
<EOS>
“Methought
<EOS>
I
heard
a
noise
,
”
he
observed
.
<EOS>
“Thou
didst
hear
my
voice
in
exhortation
,
friend
,
”
Micklegift
said
.
<EOS>
“
Remain
here
,
and
I
will
hold
forth
to
thee
.
<EOS>
”“Nay
,
my
post
is
without
,
”
the
trooper
rejoined
.
<EOS>
And
thinking
all
was
right
<EOS>
,
he
went
forth
,
closing
the
door
after
him
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
no
other
interruption
occurred
.
<EOS>
Micklegift
became
somewhat
assiduous
in
his
attentions
to
Dulcia
,
and
she
,
knowing
that
Clavering
’s
life
was
in
his
hands
,
did
not
venture
to
manifest
the
repugnance
she
felt
towards
him
.
<EOS>
Not
for
an
instant
,
however
,
did
she
stir
from
her
father
’s
side
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Beard
took
little
part
in
the
conversation
,
and
,
indeed
,
scarcely
noted
what
was
said
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Maunsel
withdrew
into
the
inner
room
,
and
sinking
into
a
chair
,
gave
way
to
painful
reflection
.
<EOS>
Thus
more
than
an
hour
passed
,
and
still
Stelfax
returned
not
.
<EOS>
Thrice
during
the
interval
—
long
it
seemed
to
the
expectants
—
had
a
sentinel
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
Although
the
imprisoned
Royalists
knew
that
the
search
would
prove
ineffectual
,
intense
anxiety
was
felt
by
them
as
to
how
the
Roundhead
leader
would
bear
his
disappointment
.
<EOS>
In
his
anger
he
might
resort
to
measures
of
increased
severity
.
<EOS>
The
savage
character
of
the
man
warranted
such
a
conclusion
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
the
sound
of
heavy
footsteps
were
heard
within
the
gallery
,
followed
by
the
grounding
of
arms
,
and
the
stern
voice
of
the
captain
of
the
Ironsides
could
be
distinguished
,
as
he
questioned
the
sentinels
.
<EOS>
Presently
afterwards
he
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
Rage
and
disappointment
were
written
in
his
features
,
and
he
glanced
fiercely
at
the
group
before
him
.
<EOS>
“Where
is
Colonel
Maunsel
?
”
<EOS>
he
demanded
,
in
a
harsh
voice
.
<EOS>
“I
am
here
,
”
the
old
Cavalier
answered
,
rising
from
his
seat
,
and
advancing
towards
him
.
<EOS>
“It
<EOS>
may
not
,
perchance
,
surprise
you
,
Colonel
Maunsel
,
to
be
told
that
my
search
—
strict
though
it
has
been
—
has
proved
fruitless
,
”
pursued
the
Ironside
captain
;
“
but
though
foiled
for
the
moment
,
I
am
not
to
be
beaten
,
as
you
will
find
to
your
cost
.
<EOS>
Three
persons
have
escaped
me
—
two
of
your
own
retainers
,
and
a
third
person
,
hidden
within
this
room
,
whose
flight
has
been
traitorously
abetted
.
<EOS>
Now
,
mark
me
,
colonel
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
to
be
proud
and
stiff
-
necked
,
like
all
your
rebellious
party
;
but
regard
for
self
may
sway
you
.
<EOS>
The
three
persons
I
have
alluded
to
are
still
in
your
house
.
<EOS>
Produce
them
,
and
you
will
save
me
some
trouble
and
yourself
vexation
.
<EOS>
Refuse
,
and
<EOS>
I
shall
take
other
three
persons
in
their
stead
,
to
be
dealt
with
as
the
authorities
may
see
fit
.
<EOS>
You
yourself
,
colonel
,
will
be
one
of
my
prisoners
.
”
<EOS>
And
he
slightly
paused
to
note
the
effect
of
his
words
upon
the
old
Cavalier
.
<EOS>
“Proceed
,
sir
,
”
said
the
other
,
firmly
.
<EOS>
“The
<EOS>
second
person
I
shall
take
will
be
Master
Beard
,
”
pursued
Stelfax
,
speaking
with
great
deliberation
.
<EOS>
“
The
third
will
be
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
”“His
daughter
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
colonel
,
starting
.
<EOS>
“
You
dare
not
do
it
.
<EOS>
On
what
pretence
would
you
make
her
a
prisoner?”“I
render
an
account
of
my
actions
to
those
only
who
have
the
right
to
question
me
,
colonel
,
”
rejoined
Stelfax
,
“
and
such
is
not
your
case
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
painful
to
act
thus
harshly
,
I
admit
;
but
you
enforce
severity
upon
me
.
<EOS>
Deliver
up
the
three
men
to
me
,
and
I
depart
at
once
,
without
offering
you
further
molestation
.
<EOS>
”“I
can
not
do
so
,
”
groaned
the
colonel—“I
would
not
,
if
I
could
.
<EOS>
”“Ay
,
there
the
truth
came
out
,
”
Stelfax
retorted
,
with
a
bitter
laugh
.
<EOS>
“
That
you
can
produce
them
if
you
will
,
I
wot
full
well
.
<EOS>
It
grieves
me
to
the
soul
to
deal
harshly
with
this
comely
and
delicate
damsel
.
<EOS>
That
I
am
forced
to
do
so
is
owing
to
perverseness
on
your
part
—
not
to
want
of
humanity
on
mine
.
”“Affect
<EOS>
not
to
feel
for
me
<EOS>
,
I
pray
you
,
sir
,
”
cried
Dulcia
.
<EOS>
“
Your
pity
is
unneeded
and
unsolicited
.
<EOS>
If
Colonel
Maunsel
and
my
father
are
made
prisoners
,
I
desire
to
go
with
them
.
<EOS>
”“Make
<EOS>
yourself
easy
,
my
child

”
Mr.
Beard
said
.
<EOS>
“
This
man
will
not
venture
to
stretch
his
authority
so
far
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
mean
to
do
as
he
avouches
.
<EOS>
”“Not
mean
it
!
”
<EOS>
Stelfax
echoed
,
in
a
jeering
tone
;
“
you
will
see
anon
whether
I
mean
what
I
say
or
not

Master
Beard

<EOS>
”“At
least
give
ear
unto
me

”
said
Micklegift
,
advancing
towards“Peace
!
<EOS>
I
will
not
listen
to
thee

cried
Stelfax
,
roughly
.
<EOS>
“Yet
<EOS>
have
I
something
to
say
unto
thee
to
which
thou
wilt
willingly
attend
,
”
said
Micklegift
,
in
no
wise
abashed
by
the
other
’s
rudeness
.
<EOS>
“
It
is
not
meet
that
this
damsel
should
be
made
thy
captive
.
”“Intercede
<EOS>
not
for
me
,
I
entreat
you
,
sir

”
<EOS>
cried
Dulcia
,
fearing
that
he
meditated
treachery
.
<EOS>
“
If
my
life
is
to
be
sacrificed
,
I
will
give
it
cheerfully
.
<EOS>
”“Nay
,
your
life
is
not
endangered

maiden
,
”
said
Stelfax
;
“
merely
your
liberty
—
<EOS>
for
the
which
,
I
repeat
,
you
have
to
thank
Colonel
Maunsel

<EOS>
”“I
say
unto
thee
again
,
captain
,
the
damsel
’s
liberty
must
not
,

shall
not

said
Micklegift

<EOS>
“Hold

thy

I
say
!

froward
fellow

cried
Stelfax
.
<EOS>
“
The
damsel
herself
desires
not
thy
mediation
.
”“Indeed
<EOS>
I
do
not
,
”
implored
Dulcia
.
<EOS>
“
Beseech
you
,
good
sir
,
let
the
matter
be
,
”
she
added
to
Micklegift
.
<EOS>
“Thou
hearest
what
she
says
,
”
cried
Stelfax
.
<EOS>
“
Trouble
me
no
further
.
<EOS>
”“I
will
not
let
the
matter
be
,
”
exclaimed
Micklegift
.
<EOS>
“
I
tell
thee
,
for
the
third
time
,
thou
shalt
not
take
the
damsel
.
<EOS>
Even
if
she
would
go
freely
with
thee
,
she
shall
not
do
it
.
<EOS>
”“This
<EOS>
passeth
all
endurance
,
”
roared
Stelfax
,
stamping
his
foot
with
rage
.
<EOS>
“
What
ho
!
guard
!
”
<EOS>
he
shouted
.
<EOS>
And
half
a
dozen
troopers
instantly
answering
the
summons
,
he
continued
,
“
Seize
this
pestilent
fellow
who
hath
dared
to
wag
his
evil
tongue
against
me
,
and
disputeth
my
authority
.
<EOS>
Thrust
a
kerchief
into
his
mouth
to
stop
his
mischievous
clamour
.
<EOS>
Cast
him
from
the
house
—
and
suffer
him
not
,
on
any
pretence
,
to
enter
it
again
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
Ironside
leader
<EOS>
’s
injunctions
were
instantly
obeyed
.
<EOS>
Micklegift
’s
arms
were
seized
and
pinioned
behind
his
back
,
while
a
cloth
thrust
into
his
mouth
prevented
his
utterance
.
<EOS>
In
this
guise
,
and
exposed
to
further
ill
-
usage
as
he
was
forced
out
of
the
room
and
hurried
down
stairs
,
he
was
kicked
out
of
the
house
,
amidst
the
jeers
of
the
troopers
and
of
such
of
the
household
as
witnessed
his
ignominious
expulsion
.

CHAPTER
<EOS>
IIIHow
The
Captain
Of
The
Ironsides
TookPossession
Of
The
Colonel
’s
ChamberNo
one
among
the
Royalists
,
except
good
Mr.
Beard
,
regretted
the
summary
dismissal
of
the
Independent
minister
.
<EOS>
Dulcia
,
indeed
,
regarded
his
ejection
as
a
most
fortunate
deliverance
,
being
convinced
that
he
was
about
to
betray
Clavering
,
when
his
design
was
frustrated
by
the
Roundhead
leader
’s
unwillingness
to
listen
to
him
.
<EOS>
Captain
Stelfax
’s
secret
object
,
however
,
was
to
get
rid
of
one
whom
he
looked
upon
as
a
troublesome
rival
.
<EOS>
Having
accomplished
his
purpose
,
he
withdrew
to
the
further
end
of
the
room
,
where
he
held
a
long
consultation
with
Delves
.
<EOS>
The
old
Cavalier
,
who
watched
them
narrowly
,
was
at
no
loss
to
understand
from
the
captain
’s
gestures
that
he
was
discussing
the
possibility
of
the
fugitives
still
being
concealed
within
the
chamber
;
and
it
was
with
no
little
alarm
that
at
one
moment
he
perceived
the
glances
of
both
the
Ironsides
directed
towards
the
mantelpiece
.
<EOS>
But
his
alarm
was
dispelled
as
quickly
as
it
arose
.
<EOS>
Stelfax
shook
his
head
as
if
to
intimate
that
no
one
could
have
found
refuge
there
.
<EOS>
His
conference
ended
,
the
captain
of
the
Ironsides
marched
up
to
the
old
Cavalier
,
and
said
,
“
I
have
resolved
upon
remaining
here
till
to
-
morrow
,
Colonel
Maunsel
,
and
if
by
that
time
the
three
persons
I
have
demanded
from
you
be
not
delivered
up
to
me
,
I
shall
be
compelled
to
execute
my
threat
in
respect
to
yourself
,
Master
Beard
,
and
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
put
to
inconvenience
in
finding
accommodation
and
provisions
for
my
men
,
you
must
not
blame
me
.
<EOS>
”“I
am
in
your
power
,
sir
,
and
must
perforce
submit
,
”
the
colonel
replied
.
<EOS>
“
What
is
your
further
pleasure?”“Humph
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Stelfax
.
<EOS>
“
I
have
no
particular
orders
to
give
.
<EOS>
My
men
must
be
well
fed
,
and
well
lodged
—
but
they
will
see
to
those
matters
themselves
—
and
it
will
be
best
to
content
them
.
<EOS>
As
to
myself
,
I
shall
merely
require
this
room
for
my
occupation
.
<EOS>
”“This
room
!
”
<EOS>
the
colonel
exclaimed
,
visibly
embarrassed
.
<EOS>
“
Will
none
other
serve
your
turn
?
<EOS>
This
is
my
own
sleeping
-
chamber
.
<EOS>
”“You
must
resign
it
to
me
for
to
-
night
,
colonel
,
”
Stelfax
rejoined
;
noticing
,
with
secret
satisfaction
,
the
other
’s
dismay
.
<EOS>
“
I
have
taken
a
fancy
to
it
,
and
can
not
study
your
convenience
.
<EOS>
”“So
<EOS>
it
seems
,
sir
,
”
said
the
old
Cavalier
,
feeling
that
remonstrance
would
be
useless
,
and
perhaps
dangerous
.
<EOS>
“
You
will
not
object
,
at
least
,
to
my
making
some
little
arrangements
within
the
chamber
,
and
removing
a
few
trifling
articles
before
you
take
possession
of
it
.
”“Assuredly
<EOS>
not
,
”
Stelfax
replied
.
<EOS>
“
Remove
what
you
please
,
colonel
.
<EOS>
But
what
you
do
must
be
done
in
my
presence
,
or
in
the
presence
of
Sergeant
Delves
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
find
I
am
indeed
a
prisoner
,
”
sighed
the
colonel
,
“
since
my
every
movement
must
needs
be
watched
.
<EOS>
”“Recollect
<EOS>
that
you
yourself
render
this
rigour
necessary
,
”
Stelfax
rejoined
;
“
and
thank
me
that
I
deal
not
more
harshly
with
you
.
<EOS>
For
you
,
fair
damsel
,
”
he
added
to
Dulcia
,
“
you
are
at
liberty
to
retire
to
your
own
apartment
,
if
you
are
so
minded
.
<EOS>
But
forget
not
that
you
are
a
prisoner
to
the
house
;
and
if
summoned
to
my
presence
,
fail
not
in
prompt
attendance
.
<EOS>
Master
Beard
,
you
can
go
with
your
daughter
—
on
the
same
conditions
.
<EOS>
”Not
<EOS>
venturing
to
remain
after
this
dismissal
,
Dulcia
and
her
father
reluctantly
,
and
full
of
misgiving
,
withdrew
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Maunsel
hoped
that
he
might
have
been
left
alone
within
the
chamber
for
a
few
minutes
,
and
so
snatch
an
opportunity
of
communicating
with
those
within
the
hiding
-
place
;
but
this
being
denied
him
,
he
would
fain
have
tarried
within
the
room
.
<EOS>
But
here
again
his
wishes
were
defeated
,
for
Stelfax
soon
afterwards
signified
to
him
,
in
a
tone
that
left
no
alternative
but
compliance
,
that
he
might
retire
.
<EOS>
The
only
favour
he
could
obtain
was
permission
to
send
Martin
Geere
for
such
articles
as
he
might
require
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
This
accorded
,
he
withdrew
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
without
considerable
trepidation
that
old
Martin
executed
his
master
’s
orders
;
and
,
on
returning
to
the
library
,
whither
the
colonel
had
repaired
,
the
old
serving
-
man
reported
that
Stelfax
had
caused
a
great
wood
fire
to
be
lighted
,
before
which
he
was
comfortably
seated
—
a
piece
of
intelligence
which
did
not
tend
to
mitigate
the
old
Cavalier
’s
anxiety
,
since
it
decreased
the
chances
of
his
son
’s
escape
.
<EOS>
Deeply
did
Colonel
Maunsel
now
regret
that
he
was
deprived
of
the
assistance
of
John
Habergeon
,
whose
shrewdness
might
have
helped
him
at
this
fearful
emergency
.
<EOS>
But
John
was
a
prisoner
as
well
as
Clavering
;
and
as
to
poor
old
Martin
Geere
,
he
was
so
bewildered
as
to
be
utterly
incapable
of
lending
efficient
assistance
.
<EOS>
Resignation
,
therefore
,
was
all
that
was
left
to
the
old
Cavalier
.
<EOS>
He
tried
to
calm
himself
,
but
in
vain
.
<EOS>
Suspense
and
anxiety
quite
overmastered
him
,
and
reduced
him
at
last
to
a
state
of
almost
stupor
.
<EOS>
If
the
colonel
was
plunged
into
the
depths
of
gloom
and
despondency
,
Dulcia
and
her
father
were
scarcely
less
miserable
.
<EOS>
In
vain
the
good
clergyman
sought
to
console
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
His
arguments
fell
upon
deaf
ears
.
<EOS>
The
poor
damsel
<EOS>
’s
faculties
were
be
-
numbed
by
terror
,
and
for
some
time
she
scarcely
gave
a
token
of
consciousness
—
all
the
efforts
of
her
father
and
Patty
Whinchat
failing
to
rouse
her
.
<EOS>
And
now
to
glance
at
the
Ironsides
.
<EOS>
As
may
be
supposed
,
the
troopers
were
by
no
means
displeased
by
the
information
that
they
were
to
pass
the
night
at
the
Grange
.
<EOS>
Like
true
soldiers
,
they
knew
right
well
when
they
were
in
good
quarters
,
and
were
in
no
hurry
to
depart
.
<EOS>
The
supplies
of
the
larder
and
the
buttery
,
notwithstanding
the
large
demands
made
upon
them
,
were
by
no
means
exhausted
;
and
if
this
stock
of
provisions
should
fail
,
there
were
sides
of
bacon
,
hams
,
and
cheeses
in
reserve
within
the
store
-
room
—
while
poultry
and
pigeons
in
any
quantity
could
be
had
from
the
farmyard
.
<EOS>
Ale
and
wine
were
unstinted
.
<EOS>
Yet
with
all
this
indulgence
there
was
no
relaxation
of
discipline
.
<EOS>
The
sentinels
were
changed
every
hour
,
and
constant
and
strict
watch
was
kept
at
all
the
points
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
It
being
the
object
of
the
household
to
keep
their
unwelcome
guests
in
good
burnout
,
everything
was
done
to
promote
this
object
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
Giles
Moppett
,
Elias
Crundy
,
with
the
cook
and
the
scullion
-
wenches
,
were
unremitting
in
their
efforts
to
please
the
redcoats
,
whom
Moppett
privately
declared
to
be
as
ravenous
as
wolves
,
and
as
thirsty
as
camels
.
<EOS>
On
their
part
,
the
Ironsides
did
not
give
way
to
any
great
licence
,
and
took
care
not
to
drink
to
excess
,
but
they
smoked
incessantly
,
and
made
the
whole
house
reek
like
a
tavern
with
the
fumes
of
tobacco
.
<EOS>
They
went
about
where
they
listed
,
without
displaying
much
respect
for
the
persons
they
encountered
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
three
or
four
of
them
,
smoking
of
course
,
entered
the
library
where
the
unhappy
colonel
was
seated
,
and
,
regardless
of
his
looks
of
anger
and
disgust
,
continued
to
puff
away
at
their
pipes
as
they
leisurely
examined
the
portraits
on
the
walls
,
or
other
objects
that
attracted
their
attention
,
passing
unseemly
comments
upon
them
.
<EOS>
One
of
them
—
it
was
Helpless
Henly
—
taking
up
the
Eikon
Basiliké
,
tore
the
book
asunder
in
a
rage
,
and
flung
the
fragments
into
the
fire
.
<EOS>
Besadaiah
Eavestaft
and
Tola
Fell
intruded
themselves
in
the
same
way
upon
Mr.
Beard
,
and
one
of
them
being
a
Fifth
Monarchy
Man
,
and
the
other
a
Muggletonian
,
they
sat
down
,
and
sought
to
enter
into
a
controversy
with
him
.
<EOS>
Doubtless
,
Dulcia
,
who
withdrew
with
Patty
,
on
the
appearance
of
the
two
troopers
,
into
an
inner
apartment
,
would
have
been
subjected
to
like
annoyance
,
but
that
Captain
Stelfax
had
given
express
orders
that
her
privacy
should
be
respected
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
Ironside
leader
himself
,
he
remained
for
more
than
two
hours
in
the
colonel
’s
chamber
,
where
,
as
we
have
already
stated
,
he
caused
a
wood
fire
to
be
lighted
,
and
where
subsequently
a
copious
repast
was
served
him
,
of
which
he
partook
.
<EOS>
His
meal
ended
,
it
occurred
to
him
to
make
an
external
examination
of
the
house
;
but
,
on
going
forth
,
he
did
not
allow
the
room
to
remain
untenanted
,
leaving
Sergeant
Delves
and
three
troopers
within
it
,
and
giving
them
strict
orders
on
no
account
to
go
forth
,
even
for
a
moment
,
until
his
return
.

Micklegift
<EOS>
To
Stelfax;And
Of
The
Plan
For
Ensnaring
The
FugitivesDevised
<EOS>
By
The
LatterALL
<EOS>
the
sentinels
were
at
their
posts
as
Stelfax
went
his
rounds
,
and
nothing
to
excite
suspicion
had
occurred
.
<EOS>
He
next
visited
the
stables
,
and
,
as
matter
of
precaution
,
directed
that
his
own
charger
,
and
half
a
dozen
troopers
’
horses
,
should
be
kept
saddled
and
bridled
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
he
proceeded
to
the
garden
,
in
order
to
study
the
architecture
of
the
back
part
of
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
The
massive
chimney
in
which
the
lurking
-
hole
was
contrived
stood
on
this
side
of
the
building
,
and
projected
far
from
the
wall
,
rising
from
its
base
in
gradations
like
those
of
a
buttress
.
<EOS>
Stelfax
easily
made
out
the
position
of
the
hiding
-
place
,
but
could
detect
no
other
recess
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
the
act
of
measuring
the
projection
of
the
chimney
,
when
Helpless
Henly
brought
word
that
two
persons
were
at
the
outer
gate
,
desiring
speech
with
him
.
<EOS>
On
inquiry
,
these
individuals
proved
to
be
Nehemiah
Lift
-
up
-
hand
and
Lawrence
Creek
.
<EOS>
Stelfax
consenting
to
see
them
,
Henly
departed
,
and
presently
returned
with
the
two
men
.
<EOS>
Very
grave
salutations
passed
between
the
Ironside
leader
and
his
visitors
.
<EOS>
“We
have
come
to
thee
,
valiant
captain
,
”
premised
Nehemiah
,
who
acted
as
spokesman
,
“
on
behalf
of
the
godly
Master
Increase
Micklegift
,
to
remonstrate
with
thee
on
thy
behaviour
towards
him
,
and
to
see
if
thou
wilt
make
him
some
amends
for
the
maltreatment
he
hath
received
.
<EOS>
”“Ye
will
lose
your
labour
,
good
sirs
,
”
Stelfax
rejoined
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
“
I
will
make
Master
Increase
Micklegift
no
amends
.
<EOS>
I
have
driven
him
from
the
house
,
and
forbidden
him
to
return
to
it
.
<EOS>
”“This
<EOS>
we
know
,
captain
,
”
said
Nehemiah
,
“
and
we
grieve
that
thou
shouldst
have
so
far
stretched
thy
authority
against
the
good
man
.
<EOS>
He
meant
thee
well
,
and
in
his
humility
and
Christian
charity
is
willing
to
overlook
the
dishonourable
treatment
he
hath
experienced
,
and
to
be
reconciled
unto
thee
.
<EOS>
”“I
rejoice
to
hear
it
,
”
Stelfax
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
Is
this
the
sum
of
his
message
to
me?”“No
,
captain
,
”
said
Nehemiah
.
<EOS>
“
The
good
man
wishes
to
be
allowed
to
confer
with
thee
.
<EOS>
”“A
<EOS>
mere
pretence
to
obtain
admission
to
the
house
,
”
thought
Stelfax
.
<EOS>
“
He
desires
to
confer
with
me
,
thou
sayest
?
”
<EOS>
he
added
aloud
.
<EOS>
“
On
what
matter?”“Nay
,
I
am
not
in
his
confidence
,
valiant
captain
,
”
Nehemiah
replied
;
“
but
I
know
that
his
business
is
of
moment
.
<EOS>
”“Ere
<EOS>
I
make
a
reply
,
I
would
put
a
question
to
thee
in
my
turn
,
good
master
messenger
.
<EOS>
Said
he
aught
to
thee
concerning
the
daughter
of
the
Episcopalian
divine
,
Master
Beard?”“Yea
,
<EOS>
verily
,
he
told
me
thou
hadst
threatened
to
take
her
away
as
thy
captive
,
”
Nehemiah
answered
.
<EOS>
“
But
he
added
,
that
he
felt
assured
thou
wouldst
not
carry
thy
menace
into
effect
,
inasmuch
as
he
could
show
thee
cogent
reasons
against
it
.
<EOS>
”“And
what
,
I
prithee
,
were
those
weighty
reasons
of
his
,
good
master
messenger
?
<EOS>
Did
he
mention
them?”“He
hinted
,
as
the
phrase
is
,
that
he
had
an
offer
to
make
to
thee
,
provided
thou
wouldst
engage
to
leave
the
damsel
unmolested
.
<EOS>
”“I
knew
it
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Stelfax
.
<EOS>
“
Take
back
my
answer
,
good
master
messenger
,
and
say
unto
Micklegift
that
I
reject
his
proposal
,
whatsoever
it
may
be
.
<EOS>
I
will
have
nought
to
do
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
is
faithless
and
perverse
,
and
in
league
with
the
Amalekites
,
and
if
he
presents
himself
again
within
this
dwelling
while
I
am
here
,
I
will
cause
him
to
be
driven
forth
with
blows
and
fustigation
.
<EOS>
Say
this
to
him
,
without
circumlocution
.
”“Since
<EOS>
thou
thinkest
thus
unjustly
of
the
worthy
man
,
captain
<EOS>
,
nothing
more
can
be
said
,
”
Nehemiah
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
I
scarcely
like
to
add
what
he
desired
us
to
declare
unto
thee
in
case
a
deaf
ear
should
be
turned
to
his
remonstrances
.
”“Forbear
<EOS>
not
out
of
consideration
to
me
,
I
prithee
,
good
master
messenger
”
<EOS>
Stelfax
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
Speak
out
,
and
fear
not
.
<EOS>
”“Thus
,
then
,
spake
he
,
captain
,
”
Nehemiah
rejoined
,
boldly
.
<EOS>
“
He
offers
you
friendship
and
aid
;
but
if
you
reject
them
,
you
may
count
upon
his
enmity
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
laugh
at
his
threats
,
good
master
messenger
,
”
Stelfax
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
Go
tell
him
so
,
and
rid
me
of
your
presence
.
<EOS>
”“We
<EOS>
grieve
that
our
mission
to
thee
has
failed
,
”
said
Lawrence
Greek
.
<EOS>
“
Fear
not
our
troubling
thee
again
,
for
we
are
both
about
to
depart
,
on
the
instant
,
from
this
village
of
Ovingdean
.
<EOS>
Fare
thee
well
,
captain
.
<EOS>
Peradventure
,
thou
mayst
regret
thou
didst
not
listen
to
the
peacemakers
.
<EOS>
”With
<EOS>
this
the
two
men
departed
;
while
the
Ironside
leader
turning
impatiently
on
his
heel
,
strode
off
in
a
different
direction
across
the
grass
-
plot
.
<EOS>
“A
<EOS>
pertinacious
and
malicious
knave
this
Mickelegift
!
”
<EOS>
ejaculated
Stelfax
,
as
he
continued
angrily
to
pace
the
sward
,
“
and
doubtless
he
will
do
me
an
ill
turn
if
he
can
;
but
I
despise
him
.
<EOS>
The
pitiful
varlet
hath
the
presumption
to
aspire
to
the
hand
of
the
lovely
Dulcia
;
but
even
if
she
would
listen
to
his
suit
—
which
is
most
unlikely
—
he
shall
never
have
her
.
<EOS>
No
;
she
shall
be
mine
.
<EOS>
Of
that
I
am
resolved
.
<EOS>
No
damsel
hath
ever
pleased
me
so
much
.
<EOS>
She
seems
to
scorn
me
,
but
I
will
find
means
to
bend
her
stubborn
spirit
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
have
it
!
”
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
his
eye
kindling
,
as
a
plan
suddenly
flashed
across
him
.
<EOS>
“
She
shall
help
me
to
discover
those
I
seek
.
<EOS>
They
are
in
that
room
,
I
am
certain
.
<EOS>
”No
<EOS>
sooner
was
the
plan
formed
than
it
was
acted
upon
.
<EOS>
Reentering
the
house
,
he
went
upstairs
to
the
old
Cavalier
’s
chamber
,
and
ordered
Delves
to
summon
Colonel
Maunsel
,
with
Mr.
Beard
and
Dulcia
,
to
his
presence
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
the
three
persons
thus
sent
for
made
their
appearance
,
preceded
by
the
sergeant
,
and
guarded
by
half
a
dozen
troopers
,
armed
with
carabines
,
among
whom
were
Besadaiah
,
Tola
,
and
Helpless
Henly
.
<EOS>
The
lynx
-
eyed
captain
of
the
Ironsides
watched
the
Royalists
closely
on
their
entrance
,
and
detected
certain
glances
from
which
he
drew
tolerably
correct
inferences
.
<EOS>
“I
shall
have
the
fugitives
now
,
”
he
thought
.
<EOS>
Clothing
his
countenance
with
its
most
awful
frowns
,
Stelfax
strode
up
to
the
little
group
,
and
said
,
in
a
threatening
voice
,
“
I
have
sent
for
you
,
Colonel
Maunsel
,
to
put
an
end
to
this
business
.
<EOS>
I
perceive
that
I
have
been
trifled
with
,
and
am
therefore
resolved
to
pursue
a
different
course
.
<EOS>
I
ask
you
,
for
the
last
time
,
will
you
deliver
up
these
fugitives
to
me?”“I
have
but
one
answer
to
give
to
the
question
,
”
the
old
Cavalier
said
,
“
and
that
is
a
refusal
.
<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
you
likewise
persist
in
refusing
to
disclose
their
hiding
-
place
,
eh
,
Master
Beard
?
”
<EOS>
pursued
Stelfax
.
<EOS>
“I
do
,
”
the
clergyman
answered
,
firmly
.
<EOS>
“My
<EOS>
final
appeal
must
be
made
to
you
,
damsel
,
”
the
Ironside
captain
went
on
;
“
and
I
would
fain
hope
that
you
may
spare
me
from
a
painful
task
which
stern
duty
imposes
.
<EOS>
By
enabling
me
to
secure
these
fugitives
—
who
can
be
nothing
to
you
—
nothing
in
comparison
,
I
mean
—
you
will
save
Colonel
Maunsel
and
your
father
from
the
torture
.
<EOS>
”“From
torture
!
”
<EOS>
ejaculated
Dulcia
,
in
affright
.
<EOS>
“Heed
<EOS>
not
what
this
crafty
and
cruel
man
says
to
you
,
Dulcia
,
”
cried
the
colonel
,
“
and
let
not
a
word
escape
your
lips
that
may
imperil
those
whose
lives
hang
on
your
firmness
.
<EOS>
He
dares
not
put
his
threat
in
execution
.
”“Dares
<EOS>
not
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Stelfax
.
<EOS>
“
Look
you
,
Colonel
Maunsel
,
I
have
already
been
told
in
this
very
room
that
I
dare
not
execute
my
threats
,
but
the
time
is
come
when
you
will
find
out
your
error
.
<EOS>
My
warrant
is
not
from
the
Parliament
,
or
even
from
the
Council
,
but
from
the
Lord
General
himself
,
and
I
am
empowered
by
it
to
deal
with
refractory
malignants
as
I
see
fit
—
as
I
see
fit
,
colonel
—
there
is
some
latitude
in
that
phrase
,
methinks
!
<EOS>
If
I
think
fit
to
shoot
you
in
your
own
court
-
yard
,
or
to
hang
you
at
your
own
gate
,
I
can
do
it
,
and
my
warrant
will
bear
me
out
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
doubt
not
that
the
murderer
of
his
most
sacred
Majesty
will
absolve
his
followers
from
any
crime
,
however
foul
,
”
rejoined
the
colonel
.
<EOS>
“That
taunt
may
cost
you
your
life
,
sir
,
”
Stelfax
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
But
it
is
to
you
,
damsel
,
and
not
to
this
imprudent
man
,
that
I
address
myself
,
”
he
added
to
Dulcia
.
<EOS>
“
Must
I
send
forth
Colonel
Maunsel
and
your
father
to
endure
the
torture?”“Oh
!
<EOS>
no
<EOS>
—
no
—
no
!
<EOS>
I
implore
you
to
spare
them
!
”
<EOS>
she
cried
,
falling
on
her
knees
before
him
.
<EOS>
“I
must
shut
my
heart
to
your
entreaties
,
damsel
,
”
Stelfax
said
.
<EOS>
“
Speak
!
<EOS>
and
I
show
pity
—
not
otherwise!”“Be
firm
,
Dulcia
,
”
Colonel
Maunsel
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
And
a
like
injunction
was
laid
upon
her
by
her
father
.
<EOS>
“You
can
not
have
the
heart
to
carry
out
your
threat
?
”
<EOS>
Dulcia
said
,
rising
to
her
feet
.
<EOS>
“There
is
only
one
way
to
move
me
,
”
he
said
,
in
a
low
voice
,
and
catching
her
arm
.
<EOS>
“
Be
mine!”“Yours
!
”
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
regarding
him
with
mixed
disgust
and
terror
,
and
almost
doubting
whether
she
had
heard
aright
.
<EOS>
“
Yours
!
<EOS>
Never!”“Reflect
!
”
<EOS>
he
said
,
under
his
breath
.
<EOS>
“
I
love
you
to
desperation
.
<EOS>
Be
mine
,
and
they
are
safe
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
I
will
depart
without
further
search
.
”“Oh
!
<EOS>
merciful
Heaven
!
<EOS>
what
have
I
done
to
deserve
this
trial
?
”
<EOS>
Dulcia
ejaculated
.
<EOS>
“
Tempt
me
not
,
”
she
added
.
<EOS>
“Say
<EOS>
the
word
,
and
it
is
done
,
according
to
my
promise
!
”
<EOS>
Stelfax
whispered
,
thinking
he
had
prevailed
.
<EOS>
“I
can
not
say
it
,
”
she
rejoined
,
in
a
tone
of
anguish
.
<EOS>
“
Whatever
may
happen
,
I
can
never
be
yours
.
<EOS>
I
would
die
a
hundred
deaths
first
.
”“Enough
<EOS>
,
proud
damsel
!
”
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
“
You
shall
find
what
it
is
to
brave
my
displeasure
.
<EOS>
Sergeant
Delves
,
”
he
continued
,
in
an
inflexible
tone
,
<EOS>
“
take
these
two
malignants
to
some
lower
chamber
suitable
for
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
Let
both
undergo
the
torture
of
the
boot
,
unless
the
first
to
endure
the
pain
shall
reveal
where
the
fugitives
are
hidden
.
<EOS>
Begin
with
Colonel
Maunsel
.
”“Oh
!
<EOS>
no
,
for
pity
’s
sake
,
spare
them
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Dulcia
,
again
falling
on
her
knees
before
him
.
<EOS>
“Arise
,
Dulcia
,
I
command
you
,
”
Colonel
Maunsel
cried
.
<EOS>
“
Come
,
sir
,
”
he
added
to
Mr.
Beard
,
“
the
base
rebels
and
regicides
shall
find
how
little
power
hath
torture
over
a
loyal
English
gentleman
,
ever
prepared
to
die
for
his
king
;
and
upon
a
clergyman
of
England
’s
true
Church
,
whose
life
has
been
spent
in
his
Maker
’s
service
.
<EOS>
They
shall
not
wring
a
groan
from
me
.
<EOS>
”“Nor
from
me
,
”
Mr.
Beard
said
,
with
equal
firmness
.
<EOS>
“Away
with
them
,
and
put
their
boasted
resolution
to
the
proof
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Stelfax
,
forcibly
disengaging
himself
from
Dulcia
.
<EOS>
Overcome
by
terror
,
the
distracted
damsel
uttered
a
scream
that
made
the
whole
chamber
ring
with
its
piercing
sound
.
<EOS>
Full
of
the
deepest
commiseration
,
her
father
and
Colonel
Maunsel
,
who
were
moving
on
towards
the
door
under
charge
of
Delves
and
the
troopers
,
turned
to
look
at
her
;
but
their
attention
was
instantly
diverted
to
another
object
.
<EOS>
That
cry
of
agony
had
summoned
other
actors
to
the
scene
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
had
it
ceased
,
when
the
pillar
masking
the
secret
entrance
to
the
hiding
-
place
flew
back
,
and
Clavering
Maunsel
stepped
forth
.
<EOS>
He
was
quickly
followed
by
John
Habergeon
and
Ninian
.
<EOS>
“Ho
!
<EOS>
ho
!
”
<EOS>
Stelfax
exclaimed
,
with
an
exulting
laugh
.
<EOS>
“
Here
are
the
men
I
want
.
<EOS>
”On
<EOS>
sight
of
Clavering
<EOS>
,
Dulcia
started
to
her
feet
,
and
flew
towards
him
,
while
he
,
yielding
to
irrepressible
emotion
,
and
seemingly
insensible
to
the
peril
in
which
he
stood
,
pressed
her
to
his
bosom
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Stelfax
regarded
the
young
man
narrowly
.
<EOS>
“This
is
not
Charles
Stuart
!
”
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
“
Who
art
thou
?
”
<EOS>
he
demanded
.
<EOS>
“I
have
no
longer
any
motive
for
concealment
,
”
the
other
answered
.
<EOS>
“
I
am
Clavering
Maunsel
.
”“Clavering
<EOS>
Maunsel
!
”
echoed
the
Roundhead
leader
,
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
“
Then
the
report
that
thou
wert
slain
at
Worcester
was
false?”“It
<EOS>
was
false
,
since
you
behold
me
here
,
”
was
the
answer
.
<EOS>
“Imprudent
boy
!
”
<EOS>
the
colonel
exclaimed
,
in
accents
of
mingled
grief
and
reproach
.
<EOS>
“
Thou
hast
doomed
thyself
to
destruction
.
<EOS>
”“Alas
!
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
I
am
to
blame
!
”
<EOS>
Dulcia
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
“
I
have
been
the
means
of
betraying
him
.
<EOS>
”“Ay
<EOS>
,
that
is
quite
certain
,
”
Stelfax
remarked
,
with
a
bitter
laugh
.
<EOS>
“Not
<EOS>
so
!
<EOS>
not
so
!
”
cried
Clavering
to
Dulcia
.
<EOS>
“
From
yon
hiding
-
place
I
overheard
what
was
passing
here
;
and
think
you
<EOS>
I
would
have
allowed
my
father
and
your
father
to
undergo
the
torture
on
my
account
?
<EOS>
I
only
waited
till
the
last
moment
,
in
the
hope
that
this
dastardly
villain
would
not
execute
his
threat
.
”“Learn
,
then
,
that
my
order
would
not
have
been
executed
,
”
Stelfax
replied
,
with
a
derisive
laugh
.
“
<EOS>
‘
Twas
but
a
device
to
lure
thee
from
thy
secure
retreat
,
and
it
has
succeeded
.
<EOS>
Ho
!
<EOS>
ho!”“Alas
!
<EOS>
unhappy
boy
,
why
did
you
come
forth
?
”
<EOS>
groaned
the
old
Cavalier
.
<EOS>
“
Your
retreat
,
you
see
,
was
not
suspected
.
<EOS>
”“No
,
in
good
sooth
it
was
not
,
”
Stelfax
said
.
<EOS>
“
Having
myself
searched
the
burrow
and
found
it
empty
,
I
did
not
suppose
it
would
be
again
occupied
;
nor
can
I
conceive
how
the
young
man
and
his
companions
found
access
to
it
,
unless
they
came
down
the
chimney
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
I
have
hit
upon
the
way
taken
,
I
find
!
”
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
perceiving
a
smile
cross
Ninian
’s
countenance
.
<EOS>
“
Possibly
,
if
you
had
remained
quiet
,
you
might
have
got
off
,
”
he
added
to
Clavering
;
“
but
it
is
too
late
to
think
of
that
now
.
”“It
<EOS>
is
not
too
late
to
sell
our
lives
dearly
,
”
the
young
Cavalier
cried
,
brandishing
his
sword
with
the
only
arm
capable
of
wielding
the
weapon
.
<EOS>
“
You
,
John
,
will
stand
by
me
—
and
you
also
,
Ninian?”“To
the
last
!
”
<EOS>
they
both
responded
.
<EOS>
“Oh
!
<EOS>
that
I
had
my
trusty
sword
in
my
grasp
!
”
<EOS>
added
John
Habergeon
.
<EOS>
”
<EOS>
I
would
quickly
cut
a
way
through
them
.
<EOS>
”“Give
<EOS>
fire
if
they
stir
!
”
<EOS>
Stelfax
shouted
to
the
troopers
.
<EOS>
And
the
carabines
of
the
Ironsides
were
levelled
at
the
young
Cavalier
and
his
companions
.
<EOS>
“I
am
the
cause
of
your
destruction

<EOS>
It
is
meet
I
should
die
with
you
,
”
cried
Dulcia
,
still
clinging
to
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“Hold
!
”
<EOS>
thundered
Stelfax
to
his
followers
.
<EOS>
“
That
damsel
must
not
be
injured
.
<EOS>
Upon
them
,
and
disarm
the
young
man!”“It
is
needless
,
”
cried
Clavering
,
throwing
down
his
sword
.
<EOS>
“
I
yield
myself
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
”“‘Sdeath
!
<EOS>
captain
,
wherefore
did
you
yield
?
”
<EOS>
John
Habergeon
grumbled
.
<EOS>
“
Why
not
let
us
fight
it
out
?
<EOS>
We
can
but
die
once
.
<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
never
better
than
now
,
”
added
Ninian
.
<EOS>
“It
is
useless
to
struggle
against
destiny
,
”
Clavering
cried
.
<EOS>
“Ay
,
it
is
quite
evident
that
Providence
—
or
,
as
you
profanely
say
,
Destiny
—
is
against
you
and
your
party
,
”
Stelfax
observed
.
<EOS>
“
The
Lord
has
declared
himself
on
the
side
of
those
who
observe
his
commandments
.
<EOS>
Remove
these
men
!
”
<EOS>
he
added
to
Delves
.
<EOS>
At
the
word
,
the
troopers
surrounded
the
prisoners
,
none
of
whom
offered
any
resistance
,
though
both
John
Habergeon
and
Ninian
eyed
their
captors
fiercely
.
<EOS>
Dulcia
,
however
,
still
clung
despairingly
to
Clavering
,
while
Delves
sought
,
though
with
much
forbearance
,
to
remove
her
.
<EOS>
“Farewell
,
Dulcia
!
”
<EOS>
Clavering
cried
,
straining
her
to
his
heart
.
<EOS>
“
This
is
my
last
embrace
.
<EOS>
We
shall
meet
no
more
on
earth
.
<EOS>
”“Must
<EOS>
we
part
thus
!
”
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
distractedly
.
<EOS>
“
May
I
not
go
with
you?”“Your
presence
would
only
distract
his
thoughts
from
preparation
for
the
death
he
will
speedily
have
to
encounter
,
damsel
,
”
the
captain
of
the
Ironsides
remarked
.
<EOS>
“
His
life
is
justly
forfeited
for
treason
and
rebellion
against
the
Commonwealth
,
and
it
were
idle
to
hold
out
any
hope
of
mercy
.
<EOS>
Assuredly
,
none
will
be
shown
him
.
<EOS>
Better
for
himself
he
had
died
,
as
I
deemed
he
had
,
at
Worcester
.
”“Better
,
indeed
!
”
<EOS>
echoed
Clavering
,
mournfully
.
<EOS>
“There
must
be
an
end
of
this
leave
-
taking
,
damsel
,
”
Stelfax
cried
,
with
fierce
impatience
.
<EOS>
“
Bid
him
farewell
,
and
for
ever!”Dulcia
made
an
effort
to
speak
,
but
the
words
expired
upon
her
lips
,
and
she
fell
,
insensible
,
into
Clavering
’s
arms
.
<EOS>
“Give
her
to
me
,
and
move
on
,
”
cried
Stelfax
,
advancing
to
take
the
fainting
maiden
from
him
.
<EOS>
“Off!—touch
<EOS>
her
not
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“
Here
,
sir
,
take
her
,
”
he
added
to
Mr.
Beard
,
who
came
up
at
the
moment
.
<EOS>
Sad
was
it
to
see
the
inanimate
girl
consigned
to
her
father
—
sad
to
behold
Mr.
Beard
’s
agonized
countenance
—
sadder
yet
to
mark
Clavering
’s
look
of
utter
despair
as
he
so
relinquished
her
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Maunsel
appeared
as
if
thunderstricken
—
almost
unconscious
of
what
was
passing
around
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
sunk
,
in
a
heavy
,
despairing
,
listless
state
,
into
a
chair
;
and
it
was
only
when
the
prisoners
were
being
led
forth
by
the
guard
that
he
roused
himself,“Farewell
,
my
dear
father
,
”
said
Clavering
,
pausing
,
and
regarding
him
piteously
.
<EOS>
“What
say’st
thou
,
my
son
?
”
<EOS>
the
old
Cavalier
rejoined
,
passing
his
hands
over
his
eyes
to
clear
his
vision
.
<EOS>
“
Where
goest
thou?”“To
my
last
fight
,
”
Clavering
replied
,
“
where
I
trust
I
shall
comport
myself
as
courageously
and
as
well
as
our
martyred
king
did
upon
the
scaffold
.
<EOS>
”“What
!
<EOS>
are
they
taking
thee
to
execution
?
”
<EOS>
cried
his
father
,
the
dreadful
truth
rushing
suddenly
upon
him
.
<EOS>
“Not
to
present
execution
,
as
I
judge
,
sir
,
”
Clavering
answered
.
<EOS>
“
I
would
it
were
so
,
for
I
am
a
-
wearied
of
life
.
<EOS>
But
you
know
what
mercy
is
to
be
expected
from
these
regicides
.
<EOS>
Give
me
your
blessing
ere
<EOS>
I
go
forth
,
”
he
added
,
bending
the
knee
to
him
.
<EOS>
“You
<EOS>
have
it
,
my
son
!
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
old
Cavalier
,
extending
his
arms
over
his
head
.
<EOS>
May
the
Father
of
Heaven
,
who
supported
our
blessed
king
in
his
last
hour
,
support
thee
in
thine!”“Delay
no
longer
,
sergeant
,
”
cried
Stelfax
,
wishful
to
interrupt
the
scene
.
<EOS>
“
Remove
the
prisoners
,
and
wait
my
further
orders
in
the
hall
of
entrance
.
<EOS>
”Upon
<EOS>
this
,
Clavering
arose
,
and
tearing
himself
from
his
father
’s
embrace
,
moved
on
.
<EOS>
“Farewell
,
your
honour
,
”
said
John
Habergeon
,
halting
a
moment
by
his
old
master
.
<EOS>
“
Give
yourself
no
concern
about
me
.
<EOS>
I
shall
die
a
dog
’s
death
at
the
hands
of
these
cursed
rebels
—
but
what
matters
it
?
<EOS>
I
have
ever
been
a
loyal
subject
to
my
king
,
and
a
faithful
servant
to
the
best
of
masters
,
and
that
will
be
my
consolation
at
my
last
hour
.
<EOS>
May
I
take
your
hand
at
parting?”“Farewell
,
my
faithful
servant
,
”
the
old
Cavalier
replied
,
warmly
grasping
John
’s
rugged
hand
;
“
we
shall
not
be
long
separated
.
”“It
<EOS>
were
but
mockery
to
wish
your
honour
long
continuance
in
a
world
like
this
,
where
only
roguery
prospers
—
you
were
better
out
of
it
,
”
John
said
.
<EOS>
“
So
,
I
hope
we
may
soon
meet
in
a
place
where
rebels
and
regicides
will
never
enter
.
”“Amen
!
”
<EOS>
the
colonel
responded
;
“
farewell
,
John
!
<EOS>
And
farewell
to
thee
,
too
,
my
poor
fellow
!
”
<EOS>
he
added
to
Ninian
,
as
the
latter
came
up
.
“
<EOS>
‘
Tis
a
pity
thou
shouldst
be
out
off
thus
early
.
<EOS>
But
they
may
spare
thee
on
the
score
of
thy
youth
.
<EOS>
”“I
will
not
ask
grace
at
their
hands
on
that
plea
—
or
any
other
,
”
Ninian
replied
,
resolutely
.
<EOS>
“
Trust
me
,
I
will
not
discredit
your
honour
’s
house
.
<EOS>
My
last
cry
shall
be
,
’
Confusion
to
old
Noll
,
and
long
life
and
a
speedy
Restoration
to
the
lawful
ruler
of
this
realm
,
his
most
sacred
Majesty
King
Charles
the
Second!”“Gag
him
,
if
he
dares
give
utterance
to
further
treason
,
”
roared
Stelfax
,
furiously
.
<EOS>
“
Away
with
them
at
once
,
sergeant
!
<EOS>
Wherefore
dost
thou
suffer
them
to
abuse
my
patience
thus?”Upon
this
,
Delves
put
the
men
in
motion
,
and
conducted
the
prisoners
down
the
principal
staircase
to
the
entrance
-
hall
,
where
Stelfax
soon
afterwards
joined
him
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VHow
<EOS>
The
Captain
Of
The
Ironsides
InspectedThe
Village
Church
,
And
Made
Another
CaptureGREAT
was
the
consternation
throughout
the
Grange
when
it
became
known
that
Clavering
Maunsel
and
the
two
others
were
captured
.
<EOS>
All
the
serving
-
men
flocked
towards
the
entrance
-
hall
to
satisfy
themselves
of
the
truth
of
the
report
,
and
the
sad
spectacle
they
there
<EOS>
beheld
left
them
no
doubt
of
its
correctness
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
a
circle
of
troopers
,
carabines
in
hand
,
stood
the
three
prisoners
;
unbound
,
but
deprived
of
all
means
of
resistance
.
<EOS>
Clavering
looked
much
depressed
,
but
the
other
two
cast
defiant
glances
at
the
guard
.
<EOS>
Near
approach
to
the
prisoners
being
interdicted
,
the
passage
leading
to
the
kitchen
and
buttery
,
which
opened
upon
the
entrance
-
hall
,
was
thronged
with
anxious
spectators
.
<EOS>
Here
old
Martin
Geere
,
Giles
Moppett
,
Elias
Crundy
,
and
others
,
were
stationed
,
conferring
amongst
themselves
in
whispers
,
and
timorously
looking
on
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
told
by
Besadaiah
Eavestaff
,
who
was
posted
at
the
upper
end
of
the
passage
,
that
the
prisoners
would
be
taken
to
Lewes
and
lodged
within
the
castle
,
but
this
was
all
they
could
learn
.
<EOS>
The
information
,
however
,
was
not
strictly
correct
.
<EOS>
The
captain
of
the
Ironsides
had
no
intention
of
departing
immediately
,
having
made
up
his
mind
to
pass
the
night
at
the
Grange
.
<EOS>
The
capture
of
the
fugitives
did
not
occasion
any
change
in
his
plans
.
<EOS>
A
brief
consultation
with
Delves
as
to
the
best
means
of
disposing
of
the
prisoners
until
the
morrow
,
led
the
sergeant
to
suggest
the
village
church
as
a
temporary
stronghold
—
churches
,
in
those
days
,
being
not
unfrequently
used
for
such
purposes
,
and
even
as
stables
.
<EOS>
Stelfax
thought
the
suggestion
good
,
but
in
order
to
satisfy
himself
of
its
feasibility
,
he
went
forth
with
Delves
to
inspect
the
sacred
structure
.
<EOS>
The
little
church
,
it
will
be
remembered
,
was
but
a
short
distance
from
the
Grange
,
standing
on
the
slope
of
the
opposite
down
,
and
the
two
Ironsides
soon
reached
it
.
<EOS>
On
entering
the
porch
,
the
door
proved
to
be
locked
,
whereupon
Stelfax
despatched
the
sergeant
to
the
adjacent
rectory
for
the
key
.
<EOS>
While
Delves
departed
on
the
errand
,
his
leader
strolled
about
the
churchyard
,
examining
the
venerable
structure
from
different
points
of
view
—
not
with
any
feelings
of
reverence
for
its
sacred
character
,
or
admiration
of
its
architectural
beauty
,
but
merely
with
a
view
to
its
adaptation
to
the
purpose
of
a
temporary
stronghold
.
<EOS>
All
was
still
around
.
<EOS>
The
evening
was
serene
and
beautiful
.
<EOS>
The
sun
had
sunk
below
the
western
hill
;
and
the
low
square
tower
of
the
church
was
darkly
defined
against
the
glowing
sky
.
<EOS>
The
only
object
not
in
harmony
with
the
peaceful
scene
was
the
formidable
figure
of
the
Ironside
in
his
martial
accoutrements
.
<EOS>
Stelfax
’s
examination
of
the
sacred
fabric
was
quite
satisfactory
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
tower
at
the
west
end
of
the
structure
appeared
to
offer
all
he
could
desire
in
the
way
of
security
.
<EOS>
It
had
no
outlet
to
the
churchyard
;
its
windows
were
only
three
in
number
,
placed
at
a
considerable
height
from
the
ground
,
acutely
pointed
,
and
so
narrow
as
to
preclude
all
chance
of
escape
by
their
means
.
<EOS>
If
the
interior
of
the
tower
corresponded
with
its
outward
appearance
,
it
would
suit
the
captain
’s
requirements
admirably
.
<EOS>
Proceeding
to
the
parsonage
-
house
,
Delves
opened
the
door
without
troubling
himself
to
knock
at
it
,
sought
out
Micklegift
,
and
,
on
finding
him
,
authoritatively
demanded
the
key
of
the
church
.
<EOS>
The
Independent
minister
energetically
refused
to
deliver
it
up
,
and
hastily
rising
,
strove
to
snatch
it
from
a
nail
in
the
wall
,
against
which
it
hung
.
<EOS>
But
the
sergeant
was
too
quick
for
him
,
and
possessing
himself
of
the
prize
,
departed
with
it
.
<EOS>
Delves
then
joined
his
leader
,
while
Micklegift
,
sorely
annoyed
at
the
occurrence
,
flew
to
his
garden
,
which
was
only
divided
from
the
churchyard
by
a
wall
,
and
soon
managed
to
obtain
a
position
whence
,
without
betraying
himself
,
he
could
,
command
their
proceedings
,
and
overhear
their
discourse
—
<EOS>
so
long
,
at
least
,
as
they
remained
outside
the
church
.
<EOS>
From
the
few
words
which
passed
between
them
previous
to
their
entering
the
sacred
edifice
,
he
ascertained
their
design
,
and
resolved
to
thwart
it
.
<EOS>
“So
<EOS>
,
this
irreverend
and
unscrupulous
soldier
of
the
Republic
,
”
thus
ran
his
meditations
,
“
whose
doings
put
to
shame
and
tarnish
the
actions
of
his
mighty
general
,
Cromwell
—
this
base
officer
having
had
the
good
fortune
to
capture
the
young
fugitive
malignant
and
his
followers
,
purposes
to
bestow
his
prisoners
for
the
night
in
my
church
,
as
in
a
stronghold
or
place
of
duresse
.
<EOS>
It
is
well
!
<EOS>
Not
for
any
love
that
I
bear
Clavering
Maunsel
—
for
,
regarding
him
as
a
rival
,
I
can
not
but
hold
him
in
aversion
;
not
for
any
desire
I
have
to
serve
the
Royalist
cause
,
for
I
am
strongly
and
conscientiously
opposed
to
it
;
but
because
of
the
hatred
I
bear
to
this
detested
Stelfax
,
and
because
of
the
dishonourable
treatment
he
hath
shown
me
,
will
I
confound
his
devices
,
and
deliver
these
captives
from
their
hands
.
<EOS>
Yea
,
I
will
set
my
wits
to
work
to
accomplish
their
liberation
,
and
I
doubt
not
of
success
.
”While
<EOS>
the
Independent
minister
was
forming
this
vindictive
resolve
,
Stelfax
and
his
companion
had
gained
an
entrance
to
the
church
,
and
the
Roundhead
leader
found
,
on
inspecting
the
interior
of
the
tower
,
that
the
opinion
he
had
formed
of
its
security
and
fitness
were
fully
justified
.
<EOS>
“
If
the
place
had
been
built
for
us
,
”
he
remarked
to
Sergeant
Delves
,
as
they
stepped
into
the
chamber
,
“
It
could
not
have
been
better
contrived
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
interior
of
the
church
tower
formed
a
small
square
chamber
,
very
lofty
in
proportion
to
its
height:—the
room
,
as
we
have
heretofore
stated
,
being
used
,
at
the
present
day
,
as
a
vestiary
.
<EOS>
Above
was
a
little
belfry
,
which
could
only
be
entered
by
a
trap
-
door
in
the
ceiling
;
but
,
as
a
tolerably
long
ladder
was
required
to
reach
this
trap
-
door
,
and
no
ladder
was
at
hand
,
little
danger
was
to
be
apprehended
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
The
walls
were
of
solid
masonry
,
coated
with
plaster
and
whitewashed
.
<EOS>
Internally
,
the
tower
was
some
feet
lower
than
the
ground
outside
it
,
so
that
the
windows
were
elevated
in
like
proportion
from
the
floor
,
and
far
out
of
the
reach
of
the
tallest
man
.
<EOS>
We
have
already
shown
that
they
were
too
narrow
to
allow
even
a
slightly
-
built
person
to
pass
through
them
.
<EOS>
The
chamber
was
entirely
empty
.
<EOS>
The
sole
entrance
to
the
tower
was
from
the
body
of
the
church
;
the
door
being
of
stout
oak
,
studded
with
flat-
headed
nails
,
and
fitted
into
a
pointed
arch
.
<EOS>
Having
completed
their
survey
,
Stelfax
and
the
sergeant
quitted
the
sacred
fabric
,
locking
the
door
as
they
went
forth
,
and
taking
the
key
with
them
.
<EOS>
As
they
passed
through
the
churchyard
,
the
Ironside
leader
made
some
observations
upon
the
strength
and
security
of
the
tower
,
and
its
suitableness
for
their
present
purpose
,
wholly
unconscious
that
his
observations
reached
the
ears
of
Micklegift
.
<EOS>
Issuing
from
the
little
gate
of
the
churchyard
,
the
Ironsides
were
about
to
descend
the
green
slope
leading
to
the
valley
,
when
,
to
their
surprise
,
they
perceived
a
couple
of
horsemen
dash
suddenly
down
the
steepest
part
of
the
escarpment
on
their
left
—
the
same
hillside
,
in
fact
,
only
at
a
more
abrupt
declivity
,
on
which
the
church
itself
was
built
.
<EOS>
The
horsemen
were
not
more
than
a
hundred
yards
off
on
first
coming
into
sight
,
but
while
they
themselves
were
fully
visible
to
the
Ironsides
,
the
latter
were
screened
from
view
by
an
intervening
hedge
,
and
a
cluster
of
overhanging
trees
.
<EOS>
Both
horsemen
were
remarkably
well
mounted
,
and
appeared
to
be
making
for
the
Grange
.
<EOS>
Stelfax
and
his
companion
stood
still
to
watch
their
course
.
<EOS>
Something
there
was
in
the
appearance
of
the
horsemen
that
led
both
lookers
-
on
to
the
conclusion
that
they
were
fugitive
Cavaliers
;
and
the
curiosity
of
the
Ironsides
was
greatly
excited
to
learn
who
they
were
,
and
what
could
have
brought
them
to
the
Grange
,
at
a
moment
of
such
peril
to
themselves
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
supposed
Royalists
,
totally
unconscious
of
danger
,
galloped
on
,
and
were
now
almost
at
the
gates
of
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
“If
<EOS>
yon
madmen
be
malignants
,
as
I
take
them
to
be
,
”
cried
Stelfax
,
with
a
laugh
,
“
they
will
fall
headlong
into
the
lion
’s
den
.
<EOS>
To
the
house
,
sergeant
,
and
let
us
assist
in
their
capture!”So
saying
,
he
drew
his
sword
,
and
closely
attended
by
Delves
,
who
likewise
plucked
forth
his
blade
,
he
ran
down
the
slope
,
and
made
for
the
house
-
gates
with
all
possible
despatch
.
<EOS>
Another
instant
confirmed
the
suspicions
which
both
Iron
-
sides
had
entertained
,
that
the
horsemen
were
Royalists
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
had
the
twain
entered
the
gates
,
through
which
they
rode
with
insensate
haste
and
utter
recklessness
of
consequences
,
than
they
were
challenged
by
the
sentinels
posted
within
the
court
.
<EOS>
At
once
comprehending
the
peril
in
which
their
inadvertence
had
placed
them
,
the
reckless
horsemen
endeavoured
to
back
out
.
<EOS>
Seeing
this
,
one
of
the
troopers
rushed
towards
the
gates
,
in
order
to
close
them
,
and
cut
off
their
retreat
,
while
the
other
,
presenting
his
carabine
,
threatened
to
fire
if
they
moved
.
<EOS>
Nothing
daunted
,
however
,
the
Cavalier
against
whom
the
musket
was
levelled
,
and
who
was
but
a
short
distance
from
the
sentinel
,
having
managed
to
draw
his
sword
,
struck
the
weapon
from
the
man
’s
grasp
.
<EOS>
The
carabine
went
off
as
it
fell
,
but
did
no
mischief
.
<EOS>
All
this
was
the
work
of
a
minute
,
and
so
rapidly
had
the
horsemen
turned
,
that
the
one
next
the
gates
passed
through
them
before
the
trooper
could
swing
round
the
heavy
iron
frames
to
prevent
his
exit
;
while
even
the
hinder
Cavalier
would
have
made
good
his
retreat
,
if
Stelfax
and
the
sergeant
had
not
come
up
at
the
juncture
.
<EOS>
Springing
at
the
foremost
horseman
,
Delves
made
an
effort
to
arrest
him
,
but
the
Cavalier
,
plunging
spurs
into
his
steed
,
dashed
against
him
with
such
force
as
to
hurl
him
to
the
ground
;
in
which
position
the
sergeant
discharged
his
pistol
at
the
fugitive
,
but
without
effect
.
<EOS>
Less
lucky
than
his
companion
,
who
thus
got
off
uninjured
,
the
second
Cavalier
had
to
encounter
Stelfax
,
who
rushed
up
to
him
without
hesitation
,
and
,
seizing
his
bridle
,
bade
him
surrender
.
<EOS>
The
Cavalier
replied
by
a
desperate
cut
at
the
Ironside
leader
’s
head
,
which
might
have
cleared
the
way
for
him
if
it
had
taken
effect
;
but
Stelfax
warded
off
the
blow
,
and
,
catching
hold
of
his
antagonist
,
dragged
him
by
sheer
force
of
arm
from
his
horse
.
<EOS>
The
contest
,
though
taking
some
time
to
narrate
,
had
been
,
in
reality
,
so
brief
,
that
no
one
else
could
take
part
in
it
;
though
several
troopers
rushed
towards
the
scene
of
strife
.
<EOS>
The
luckless
Cavalier
who
had
thus
been
captured
by
the
stalwart
Ironside
leader
,
was
tall
and
well
proportioned
.
<EOS>
His
attire
was
sad
-
coloured
,
and
of
Puritan
plainness
,
and
his
locks
cropped
close
to
his
head
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
his
looks
and
deportment
did
not
agree
with
these
symbols
of
Puritanism
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
of
middle
age
,
but
of
undiminished
energies
,
as
his
hardy
opponent
had
discovered
.
<EOS>
While
holding
the
discomfited
Cavalier
in
his
iron
grasp
,
Stelfax
scanned
his
features
for
a
short
space
;
and
then
shouted
to
Delves
,
who
by
this
time
had
regained
his
legs
,
demanding
,
“
Tell
me
—
whom
dost
thou
hold
this
malignant
to
be?”“It
is
not
Charles
Stuart
,
”
the
sergeant
replied
,
surveying
the
captive
.
<EOS>
“Charles
Stuart!—tush
!
<EOS>
This
man
of
middle
age
.
<EOS>
Look
again
,
and
carefully
.
<EOS>
Hast
thou
beheld
that
face
before?”“Yea
,
verily
have
I
,
and
at
Worcester
,
”
the
sergeant
answered
.
<EOS>
“
It
is
the
face
of
one
who
,
at
that
conflict
,
commanded
the
left
wing
of
the
army
of
Abijam
,
the
son
of
Rehoboam
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
Lord
Wilmot
.
<EOS>
”“Thou
<EOS>
art
right
,
”
Stelfax
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
“
It
is
the
Lord
Wilmot
.
<EOS>
Of
a
truth
,
this
is
an
important
capture
—
next
to
that
of
the
Young
Man
himself
,
the
most
important
that
could
have
been
effected
,
and
the
one
that
will
give
the
greatest
satisfaction
to
the
Lord
General
.
<EOS>
But
though
we
have
taken
a
commander
of
a
division
,
the
leader
of
the
whole
army
may
have
escaped
us
.
<EOS>
Peradventure
,
it
was
Abijam
himself
who
hath
just
fled
.
<EOS>
Didst
thou
note
the
features
and
person
of
the
man
whom
thou
didst
vainly
essay
to
capture?”“I
looked
upon
him
as
he
charged
me
,
”
Delves
replied
;
“
and
methought
he
was
younger
,
and
more
active
than
this
man
,
and
of
a
swarthy
complexion—”“‘Tis
<EOS>
he!—‘tis
<EOS>
Charles
Stuart
in
person
!
<EOS>
I
am
well
assured
of
it
,
”
Stelfax
cried
out
in
great
excitement
.
<EOS>
“
Sound
boot
and
saddle
!
<EOS>
I
will
pursue
instantly
.
<EOS>
I
will
scour
the
country
round
but
I
will
have
him
.
<EOS>
”“You
are
deceived
,
sir
,
”
said
Lord
Wilmot
,
who
had
not
hitherto
uttered
a
syllable
.
<EOS>
“
It
is
not
the
king
who
hath
just
ridden
off
.
<EOS>
His
Majesty
is
safe
across
the
Channel
.
<EOS>
”“I
will
not
take
your
word
on
that
point
,
my
lord
,
”
the
Ironside
leader
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
What
ho
!
”
<EOS>
he
vociferated
at
the
top
of
his
stentorian
voice
.
<EOS>
“
My
horse
without
a
moment
’s
delay—‘tis
<EOS>
well
I
kept
him
ready
for
instant
service
—
three
men
to
go
with
me

<EOS>
The
rest
shall
remain
here
to
guard
the
prisoners
till
my
return
.
<EOS>
The
fugitive
is
yet
in
sight
;
but
I
shall
lose
him
if
ye
delay
—
quick
,
knaves
,
quick

<EOS>
Ha

<EOS>
he
has
gained
the
top
of

hill
<EOS>
—
he
disappears
—
he
will
escape

if

be
praised

”
<EOS>
Lord
Wilmot
exclaimed
,
with
irrepressible
emotion
.
<EOS>
“Give
praises
to
Heaven
if
I
fail
to
take
your
young
monarch
,
my
lord
,
but
not
before
.
<EOS>
Here
comes
my
horse

”
cried
Stelfax
,
vaulting
into
the
saddle
.
<EOS>
“
Lead
our
noble
captive
into
the
house
,
sergeant
.
<EOS>
Let
his
person
be
searched
carefully
,
and
then
put
him
with

<EOS>
If
I
return
not
speedily
,
remove
them
all
to
the

and
keep
strict
watch
over
them

<EOS>
And
hark
ye

if

attempted

spare
not

smite

<EOS>
”“Fear

”
Delves
replied
.
<EOS>
“
I
will
make
a
terrible
example
of
all
such
as
oppose
our
authority
.
<EOS>
”Three
mounted
troopers
having
by
this
time
joined
their
leader
,
the
little
party
struck
spurs
into
their
horses
,
and
galloped
along
the
valley
,
and
then
up
the
steep
escarpment
on
the
left
,
pursuing
the
course
taken
by
the
fugitive

<EOS>
IShowing
<EOS>
How
Ninian
Escaped;And
<EOS>
How
The
Other
Prisoners
WereTaken
<EOS>
To
The
Church
TowerA
CONFLICT
,
such
as
we
described
in
the
last
chapter
,
between
Cavalier
and
Roundhead
,
where
the
odds
were
so
greatly
against
the
former
,
could
not
fail
to
excite
vividly
the
feelings
of
staunch
partisans
of
the
royal
cause
like
Clavering
and
John
Habergeon
.
<EOS>
But
the
person
among
the
prisoners
who
profited
by
the
confusion
incident
to
the
capture
of
Lord
Wilmot
and
the
flight
of
his
companion
was
Ninian
Saxby
.
<EOS>
While
the
attention
of
the
guard
was
attracted
to
what
was
going
on
outside
,
the
young
falconer
slipped
suddenly
between
two
of
the
soldiers
,
and
,
almost
at
a
bound
,
reached
the
entrance
to
the
passage
leading
to
the
buttery
.
<EOS>
This
passage
was
thronged
with
various
members
of
the
household
,
and
amongst
them
was
Ninian
’s
own
father
,
who
beheld
with
the
utmost
anxiety
the
daring
attempt
of
his
son
.
<EOS>
At
the
head
of
the
passage
Besadaiah
Eavestaff
was
posted
,
carabine
in
hand
.
<EOS>
But
he
failed
to
impede
the
young
falconer
’s
flight
.
<EOS>
Before
he
could
level
his
gun
,
his
arms
were
seized
by
those
behind
him
,
and
Ninian
was
enabled
to
pass
by
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
was
he
gone
than
the
passage
was
blocked
up
,
and
it
could
not
be
cleared
till
pursuit
was
useless
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
for
Ninian
,
the
patrol
at
the
rear
of
the
mansion
had
just
been
removed
,
so
there
was
no
further
hindrance
to
his
retreat
.
<EOS>
On
being
informed
of
the
young
falconer
’s
escape
,
which
he
learnt
as
he
entered
the
hall
with
Lord
Wilmot
and
the
guard
,
Sergeant
Delves
was
greatly
enraged
,
and
sharply
reprimanding
the
troopers
,
especially
Besadaiah
Eavestaff
,
for
neglect
of
duty
,
threatened
to
make
a
severe
example
of
such
of
the
household
as
had
aided
Ninian
’s
flight
.
<EOS>
The
principal
offender
,
and
the
person
who
had
seized
Besadaiah
from
behind
,
turned
out
,
upon
inquiry
,
to
be
the
fugitive
’s
own
father
;
but
he
,
too
,
had
disappeared
.
<EOS>
Delves
was
therefore
obliged
to
content
himself
with
clearing
the
passage
from
all
intruders
,
which
he
did
in
a
very
summary
manner
.
<EOS>
No
great
pains
were
taken
to
recapture
Ninian
.
<EOS>
Though
vexed
at
the
occurrence
,
as
knowing
it
would
irritate
Stelfax
when
it
came
to
his
knowledge
,
the
sergeant
did
not
like
to
diminish
the
guard
by
sending
men
to
scour
the
country
in
quest
of
an
escaped
prisoner
of
little
consequence
,
thereby
endangering
the
security
of
his
more
important
captives
,
Lord
Wilmot
and
Clavering
Maunsel
.
<EOS>
Stelfax
’s
orders
in
regard
to
Lord
Wilmot
were
strictly
obeyed
.
<EOS>
The
Royalist
nobleman
was
searched
;
but
no
letters
or
papers
referring
to
the
fugitive
monarch
,
or
calculated
to
give
the
slightest
clue
to
his
retreat
,
were
discovered
.
<EOS>
Lord
Wilmot
smiled
contemptuously
as
Delves
scrutinized
’
the
tablets
and
pocket
-
book
handed
to
him
by
the
searchers
.
<EOS>
The
memoranda
contained
in
these
little
books
were
written
in
a
cypher
perfectly
unintelligible
to
the
sergeant
;
but
though
he
could
make
nothing
of
the
mysterious
characters
,
Delves
thought
his
leader
might
be
able
to
unravel
them
,
and
he
therefore
put
the
books
carefully
into
his
pouch
.
<EOS>
Only
a
few
pieces
of
gold
were
found
in
Lord
Wilmot
’s
purse
;
so
that
he
must
have
disposed
of
the
large
sum
of
money
which
he
had
obtained
that
morning
from
Zachary
Trangmar
.
<EOS>
But
of
this
the
sergeant
knew
nothing
,
and
consequently
made
no
inquiries
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Just
as
the
search
was
completed
,
Colonel
Maunsel
was
seen
tottering
down
the
principal
staircase
,
which
communicated
with
the
entrance
-
hall
.
<EOS>
He
was
supported
by
old
Martin
Geere
,
and
appeared
greatly
debilitated
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
not
allowed
to
descend
to
the
hall
.
<EOS>
At
a
sign
from
Delves
,
two
troopers
planted
themselves
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
,
crossing
their
carabines
,
as
an
intimation
to
the
old
Cavalier
that
he
could
not
pass
.
<EOS>
Thereupon
,
he
stopped
midway
in
the
staircase
,
and
gazed
at
the
group
below
.
<EOS>
“Who
<EOS>
have
you
there
?
”
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
“
It
is
not
—
it
can
not
be
the
king
!
<EOS>
Some
one
cried
out
just
now
that
his
Majesty
was
taken
,
but
I
will
not
believe
the
evil
tidings
.
<EOS>
”“Fear
<EOS>
nothing
,
colonel
,
”
cried
Lord
Wilmot
.
<EOS>
“
Our
gracious
monarch
will
never
be
captured
by
these
men
.
<EOS>
He
is
safe
from
their
pursuit
.
”“Heaven
<EOS>
be
praised
!
”
<EOS>
the
old
Cavalier
fervently
ejaculated
.
<EOS>
“
I
can
not
discern
the
features
of
him
who
speaks
to
me
,
but
the
voice
is
the
voice
of
a
friend
.
”“Inveterate
<EOS>
malignant
as
thou
art
,
there
is
no
reason
why
thou
shouldst
remain
in
ignorance
of
the
rank
and
title
of
the
prisoner
we
have
made
,
”
Delves
rejoined
,
“
and
I
will
therefore
declare
them
unto
thee
.
<EOS>
Not
many
minutes
since
,
two
men
rode
up
to
thy
gates
with
such
blind
precipitation
,
that
they
perceived
not
,
till
too
late
,
that
the
house
was
in
the
possession
of
the
soldiers
of
the
Commonwealth
.
<EOS>
One
of
these
insensate
persons
was
speedily
captured
,
and
proved
to
be
the
Lord
Wilmot
,
the
chosen
friend
of
thy
sovereign
.
<EOS>
The
other
effected
a
retreat
,
but
our
captain
hath
started
in
pursuit
of
him
,
and
will
not
relinquish
the
chase
till
the
prey
be
secured
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
his
lordship
’s
denial
,
I
leave
thee
to
conjecture
who
was
likely
to
have
been
his
companion
.
<EOS>
”“For
Colonel
Maunsel
’s
satisfaction
,
and
not
for
thine
,
fellow
,
”
cried
Lord
Wilmot
,
“
I
repeat
that
it
is
not
as
thou
wouldst
insinuate
.
<EOS>
His
Majesty
is
far
away
from
this
place
.
<EOS>
In
regard
to
my
own
inopportune
visit
to
Ovingdean
Grange
,
I
can
,
at
the
proper
season
,
render
such
explanation
as
will
absolve
Colonel
Maunsel
from
any
suspicion
of
complicity
with
me
or
my
companion
.
<EOS>
”“I
pray
your
lordship
not
to
bestow
a
thought
upon
me
,
”
the
old
Cavalier
cried
.
<EOS>
“
Let
these
miscreants
glut
themselves
with
my
blood
if
they
will
.
<EOS>
They
have
robbed
me
of
my
darling
boy
,
and
I
care
not
what
else
they
take
.
”“Be
<EOS>
comforted
,
my
father
,
”
said
Clavering
;
“
my
troubles
will
soon
be
over
.
<EOS>
Bethink
thee
of
the
sacred
cause
for
which
I
lay
down
my
life
.
<EOS>
That
reflection
will
support
me
in
my
latest
hour
.
<EOS>
Let
it
support
thee
now!”“Well
said
,
young
sir
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Lord
Wilmot
,
extending
his
hand
to
him
,
which
Clavering
warmly
grasped
.
<EOS>
“
These
are
sentiments
to
deprive
the
scaffold
of
all
terror
.
<EOS>
But
trust
me
,
”
he
added
,
in
a
cheerful
tone
,
“
you
will
disappoint
your
bloodthirsty
captors
.
<EOS>
You
are
reserved
for
better
days
.
<EOS>
”“Mayhap
<EOS>
your
lordship
also
calculates
upon
escaping
the
punishment
due
to
your
treasonable
offences
against
the
Commonwealth
?
”
<EOS>
jeered
Delves
.
<EOS>
“I
calculate
upon
enjoying
the
fruits
of
my
fidelity
to
a
gracious
lord
and
master
,
”
Lord
Wilmot
replied
,
“
as
well
as
of
my
unceasing
efforts
to
free
his
kingdom
from
the
bloodthirsty
and
rebellious
fanatics
by
whom
it
is
overrun
.
<EOS>
Look
well
to
thy
charge
,
sirrah
,
for
,
by
my
faith
,
thou
shalt
have
some
trouble
to
hold
me
.
<EOS>
”As
<EOS>
these
bold
words
were
uttered
,
his
lordship
’s
eye
rested
upon
John
Habergeon
,
and
he
read
in
the
old
trooper
’s
looks
that
any
attempt
he
might
make
for
his
own
liberation
would
be
effectively
seconded
by
him
.
<EOS>
Upon
one
person
,
for
whose
benefit
the
captive
nobleman
’s
observations
were
chiefly
uttered
,
they
produced
a
cheering
effect
.
<EOS>
Hope
was
suddenly
reawakened
in
Colonel
Maunsel
’s
breast
,
and
he
roused
himself
from
the
state
of
almost
atony
into
which
he
had
sunk
.
<EOS>
Things
did
not
look
now
quite
so
desperate
as
they
had
done
.
<EOS>
He
began
to
conceive
projects
for
his
son
’s
deliverance
,
and
even
debated
with
himself
the
possibility
of
stirring
up
his
house
hold
to
an
attack
upon
the
Ironsides
.
<EOS>
But
Delves
did
not
allow
him
much
time
for
reflection
.
<EOS>
Though
regarding
Lord
Wilmot
’s
speech
as
mere
bravado
—
Cavalier
’s
rodomontade
,
he
styled
it
—
<EOS>
the
sergeant
thought
that
the
prisoners
had
given
their
tongues
licence
enough
.
<EOS>
A
stop
must
be
put
to
the
further
expression
of
their
sentiments
.
<EOS>
Sternly
ordering
them
to
keep
silence
,
he
signified
in
a
peremptory
tone
to
Colonel
Maunsel
that
he
must
retire
to
his
own
chamber
.
<EOS>
The
command
roused
the
old
Cavalier
’s
ire
,
and
he
seemed
by
no
means
inclined
to
obey
it
;
but
his
son
besought
him
by
his
looks
to
yield
compliance
,
and
,
after
a
little
hesitation
,
he
remounted
the
staircase
much
more
firmly
than
he
had
come
down
it
,
and
disappeared
.
<EOS>
Three
wearisome
hours
passed
by
,
and
Stelfax
had
not
returned
.
<EOS>
During
the
whole
of
this
time
the
prisoners
were
detained
in
the
entrance
-
hall
.
<EOS>
Not
a
word
was
exchanged
between
Lord
Wilmot
and
Clavering
that
did
not
reach
the
ears
of
Delves
,
who
stood
close
beside
them
.
<EOS>
The
sergeant
,
however
,
began
to
find
this
lengthened
attendance
irksome
,
and
his
men
,
moreover
,
looked
as
if
a
little
change
would
be
agreeable
.
<EOS>
Preparations
were
,
therefore
,
made
for
the
removal
of
the
prisoners
to
the
church
.
<EOS>
Delves
had
sixteen
men
under
his
command
,
three
of
the
troopers
,
as
already
intimated
,
having
gone
with
Stelfax
in
pursuit
of
the
fugitive
Cavalier
.
<EOS>
Half
of
the
force
at
his
disposal
the
sergeant
decided
upon
taking
with
him
to
the
church
,
deeming
that
number
ample
guard
for
the
prisoners
:
the
other
half
should
stay
at
the
Grange
to
keep
watch
over
the
malignant
colonel
and
his
household
.
<EOS>
But
before
carrying
his
plan
into
execution
,
he
repaired
to
the
buttery
,
and
causing
a
couple
of
baskets
to
be
filled
with
provisions
and
wine
,
despatched
Moppett
and
Crundy
—
under
a
guard
—
with
these
stores
to
the
church
;
and
,
on
their
return
,
he
took
out
his
prisoners
,
and
placing
himself
at
the
head
of
the
escort
,
moved
towards
the
sacred
edifice
.
<EOS>
Torches
to
light
the
troop
were
carried
by
old
Ticehurst
,
<EOS>
the
gardener
,
and
Nut
Springett
,
who
had
been
pressed
into
the
service
;
and
the
flare
of
the
flambeaux
was
reflected
upon
the
steel
caps
,
corslets
,
and
carabines
of
the
Ironsides
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
the
guard
,
by
whom
they
were
closely
surrounded
,
marched
the
prisoners
.
<EOS>
The
torchlight
flashed
upon
gate
and
wall
,
upon
overhanging
tree
and
thick
hedge
-
row
as
the
little
party
advanced
—
Delves
keeping
a
wary
look
-
out
lest
any
attack
should
be
attempted
.
<EOS>
Though
all
the
Roundhead
soldiers
were
religious
fanatics
,
not
one
of
them
had
the
slightest
scruple
in
turning
the
sacred
pile
they
were
approaching
into
a
strong
-
room
for
their
prisoners
,
and
a
barrack
for
themselves
.
<EOS>
No
feeling
of
irreverence
crossed
them
as
the
church
-
door
was
unlocked
,
and
the
sergeant
marched
into
the
little
nave
with
as
much
unconcern
as
if
he
had
been
entering
a
stable
.
<EOS>
Old
Ticehurst
and
Springett
were
dismissed
at
the
church
-
door
,
their
services
being
no
longer
required
;
but
the
torches
were
brought
into
the
building
,
and
set
up
in
such
a
position
that
their
flame
illuminated
the
whole
of
the
interior
.
<EOS>
Very
strange
the
place
looked
by
this
lurid
light
—
so
much
like
a
sepulchre
as
a
church
.
<EOS>
The
sergeant
’s
first
business
was
to
secure
his
prisoners
.
<EOS>
Finding
all
as
he
had
left
it
,
he
put
them
inside
the
tower
,
informing
them
with
a
grin
that
they
saw
their
place
of
lodging
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
Lord
Wilmot
glanced
at
the
bare
walls
and
the
cold
flagged
floor
,
and
shuddered
involuntarily
,
but
made
no
remonstrance
,
and
Clavering
was
equally
silent
.
<EOS>
But
John
Habergeon
did
not
display
any
such
self
-
restraint
,
but
loudly
remonstrated
with
the
sergeant
,
and
in
the
end
succeeded
in
obtaining
from
him
an
oaken
bench
,
a
flask
of
wine
,
a
loaf
of
bread
with
some
cold
viands
,
and
a
small
lighted
lamp
.
<EOS>
The
strong
oak
door
of
the
tower
was
left
ajar
,
in
order
that
the
movements
of
the
prisoners
might
be
observed
;
and
close
to
this
door
a
trooper
—
it
was
Helpless
Henly
—
was
posted
.
<EOS>
The
prisoners
disposed
of
,
the
gaolers
prepared
to
enjoy
themselves
.
<EOS>
The
church
-
door
was
locked
inside
to
prevent
all
chance
of
sudden
intrusion
;
benches
were
drawn
together
,
on
one
of
which
the
contents
of
the
baskets
were
placed
;
and
Delves
,
who
declared
he
was
sore
hungered
,
set
his
comrades
the
example
by
making
a
vigorous
attack
upon
a
goose
-
pie
,
which
,
in
addition
to
being
very
savoury
,
was
strongly
provocative
of
thirst
,
compelling
the
sergeant
to
make
frequent
application
to
the
wine
-
flask
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
it
would
almost
seem
as
if
those
who
stocked
the
baskets
had
sought
out
the
most
powerful
incentives
to
drinking
.
<EOS>
Besides
the
goose
-
pie
before
mentioned
,
there
was
the
best
part
of
a
salted
chine
of
beef
,
together
with
three
or
four
powdered
neats
’
tongues
.
<EOS>
These
relishing
viands
soon
produced
the
intended
effect
upon
those
who
partook
of
them
,
and
flask
after
flask
was
quickly
emptied
.
<EOS>
But
the
thirst
of
the
Ironsides
seemed
to
increase
instead
of
diminishing
,
and
Tola
Fell
asked
leave
of
the
sergeant
,
to
procure
a
fresh
supply
of
wine
from
the
Grange
.
<EOS>
Delves
,
however
,
who
could
not
fail
to
perceive
that
a
certain
impression
had
been
already
produced
by
the
copious
draughts
which
his
comrades
had
swallowed
,
peremptorily
refused
—
a
decision
which
naturally
occasioned
some
grumbling
—
but
good
humour
was
at
once
restored
by
the
accidental
discovery
by
Besadaiah
Eavestaff
of
a
couple
of
large
stone
bottles
of
strong
waters
,
snugly
packed
at
the
bottom
of
a
basket
,
which
had
been
hitherto
unaccountably
overlooked
.
<EOS>
Loud
shouts
were
raised
by
the
troopers
as
these
bottles
were
brought
forth
.
<EOS>
In
vain
Delves
,
who
began
to
be
seriously
apprehensive
of
the
consequences
,
enjoined
the
men
to
abstain
from
further
intemperance
.
<EOS>
His
authority
was
set
at
nought
.
<EOS>
The
bottles
were
passed
from
hand
to
hand
,
and
as
one
of
them
neared
the
sergeant
,
he
found
the
odour
so
irresistible
that
he
could
not
pass
the
vessel
without
taking
toll
of
its
contents
.
<EOS>
The
strong
waters
quickly
unloosed
the
tongues
of
the
troopers
;
they
began
to
laugh
and
talk
loudly
,
to
sing
and
shout
,
comporting
themselves
as
boisterously
as
wassailers
at
a
tavern
.
<EOS>
They
gave
themselves
up
to
enjoyment
,
and
in
order
to
set
themselves
completely
at
ease
,
unbuckled
their
belts
,
and
took
off
their
bandoleers
,
corslets
,
and
steel
caps
,
and
in
the
end
disembarrassed
themselves
of
their
scarlet
jerkins
.
<EOS>
Stretching
themselves
luxuriously
upon
the
benches
,
they
lighted
their
pipes
,
and
soon
filled
the
church
with
the
fumes
of
tobacco
.
<EOS>
After
a
while
,
their
potations
began
to
tell
.
<EOS>
Half
of
them
dropped
asleep
,
and
Helpless
Henly
,
who
had
drunk
rather
more
than
his
comrades
,
was
obliged
to
lean
against
the
wall
for
support
,
looking
the
picture
of
inebriety
.
<EOS>
Delves
was
greatly
enraged
at
the
insubordination
of
his
men
.
<EOS>
Finding
it
vain
to
rouse
Helpless
Henly
to
a
sense
of
duty
,
he
pushed
him
aside
,
and
took
his
place
.
<EOS>
The
drunken
fellow
reeled
forward
,
and
,
stumbling
over
a
bench
,
lay
stretched
upon
the
flags
,
whence
he
was
unable
to
rise
.
<EOS>
At
the
noise
caused
by
the
fall
of
the
huge
Ironside
,
both
Lord
Wilmot
and
Clavering
,
who
had
been
seated
on
the
bench
,
started
to
their
feet
,
and
the
former
advanced
to
the
door
to
see
what
was
the
matter
,
but
,
being
instantly
noticed
by
Delves
,
he
was
ordered
back
.
<EOS>
But
the
glance
had
been
enough
to
disclose
to
his
lordship
the
inebriate
condition
of
the
troopers
,
and
he
whispered
to
his
companions
that
he
thought
an
attempt
to
escape
would
soon
be
practicable
.
<EOS>
The
only
person
,
as
it
seemed
to
him
,
capable
of
offering
effectual
resistance
was
Delves
.
<EOS>
If
he
were
overcome
,
the
rest
might
be
easily
mastered
.
<EOS>
Having
heard
what
Lord
Wilmot
said
,
John
Habergeon
crept
stealthily
to
the
door
,
and
,
after
reconnoitring
the
scene
before
him
for
a
short
time
,
told
his
companions
to
hold
themselves
in
readiness
for
a
sudden
outburst
.
<EOS>
“The
<EOS>
grand
point
,
”
he
said
,
“
is
to
prevent
,
if
possible
,
these
rascals
from
using
their
fire
-
arms
,
or
the
alarm
will
be
given
to
their
comrades
at
the
Grange
.
<EOS>
When
the
attack
is
made
,
let
me
go
out
first
,
and
I
will
engage
to
disarm
the
sergeant
.
<EOS>
With
the
rest
we
must
take
our
chance
.

”CHAPTER
<EOS>
IIThe
Chase
Of
The
CavalierLEAVING
<EOS>
the
desecrated
church
for
a
while
,
we
will
now
follow
Stelfax
and
his
men
in
their
chase
after
the
fugitive
Cavalier
.
<EOS>
On
gaining
the
brow
of
the
hill
which
the
flying
horseman
had
crossed
,
the
Roundhead
leader
looked
around
in
vain
for
the
object
of
his
quest
,
and
came
to
a
momentary
halt
.
<EOS>
The
position
he
and
his
men
had
attained
was
a
most
commanding
one
,
being
,
in
fact
,
the
south
-
eastern
boundary
of
the
existing
race-
course
.
<EOS>
To
those
unfamiliar
with
the
locality
,
it
may
be
proper
to
mention
that
the
Brighton
race
-
course
—
one
of
the
most
beautifully
situated
in
England
—
forms
a
wide
semicircular
sweep
over
the
gently
undulating
ridges
of
a
very
extensive
down
.
<EOS>
The
large
arc
described
by
this
noble
hill
embraces
part
of
Kemp
Town
,
and
constitutes
a
worthy
background
to
Brighton
itself
.
<EOS>
At
present
the
race-
hill
retains
much
of
its
original
character
;
but
encroachments
are
being
constantly
made
upon
the
springy
turf
so
dear
to
the
pedestrian
and
the
horseman
.
<EOS>
At
the
time
,
however
,
of
our
story
the
eminence
was
wholly
uncultivated
and
unenclosed
.
<EOS>
Magnificent
was
the
view
which
it
offered
to
Stelfax
and
his
followers
.
<EOS>
The
sea
was
dyed
with
the
gorgeous
hues
of
the
sun
,
which
had
just
sank
beneath
the
waves
.
<EOS>
Towards
the
west
the
whole
line
of
coast
was
visible
,
from
the
little
fishing
town
of
Brightelmstone
,
with
its
small
ruinous
castle
or
block
-
house
standing
close
to
the
shore
;
Shoreham
,
with
its
harbour
,
in
which
a
few
vessels
were
moored
;
and
,
farther
on
,
Worthing
,
and
the
narrow
neck
of
land
beyond
it
jutting
out
far
into
the
sea
.
<EOS>
In
this
direction
,
also
,
the
Isle
of
Wight
could
now
be
distinctly
seen
,
rising
proudly
out
of
the
glowing
waters
.
<EOS>
Exactly
opposite
the
Roundhead
leader
—
though
to
reach
it
he
would
have
had
to
cross
a
lower
intermediate
hill
—
stood
one
of
those
ancient
encampments
found
on
many
commanding
points
of
the
downs
,
and
denominated
the
White
Hawk
.
<EOS>
Hard
by
this
antique
camp
stood
a
fire
-
beacon
.
<EOS>
Other
camp
-
crowned
hills
were
also
visible
from
the
spot
where
Stelfax
stood
—
namely
,
Ditchling
,
which
,
moreover
,
possessed
a
beacon
;
Hollingsbury
,
Wolstonbury
,
and
Chanctonbury
,
the
latter
constituting
a
landmark
from
its
clump
of
fir-
trees
.
<EOS>
The
view
Stelfax
beheld
,
though
sufficiently
striking
,
differed
materially
from
that
which
would
now
be
offered
to
a
spectator
stationed
on
the
same
spot
.
<EOS>
No
modern
race
-
stand
towered
before
the
stern
soldier
of
the
Commonwealth
as
he
cast
his
eye
on
the
opposite
hill
—
no
lines
of
white
railings
marked
out
the
course
reserved
for
struggling
steeds
—
no
mighty
structures
reared
on
the
southern
slopes
of
the
declivity
met
his
ken
—
<EOS>
no
stately
terraces
built
on
the
high
cliffs
overlooking
the
sea
awakened
his
admiration
,
or
proclaimed
the
vicinity
of
a
large
and
well
-
built
town
.
<EOS>
Nothing
of
this
kind
did
the
Roundhead
behold
.
<EOS>
In
the
valley
immediately
beneath
him
were
a
barn
and
sheepfold
.
<EOS>
At
the
point
called
the
black
Rock
,
near
the
coast
,
a
small
farm
-
house
,
with
two
or
three
cottages
adjoining
it
,
could
be
distinguished
.
<EOS>
These
were
the
only
habitations
in
sight
.
<EOS>
An
air
of
solitude
pervaded
the
hill
.
<EOS>
A
single
figure
,
darkly
defined
against
the
still
radiant
western
sky
,
and
dilated
to
gigantic
proportions
,
could
be
perceived
on
the
verge
of
the
Roman
encampment
near
the
fire
-
beacon
.
<EOS>
None
else
was
in
sight
,
save
an
old
grey
-
coated
shepherd
,
who
,
crook
in
hand
,
and
attended
by
his
dog
,
was
driving
a
flock
of
loudly
-
bleating
sheep
down
the
steep
escarpment
towards
the
fold
in
the
valley
.
<EOS>
A
few
seconds
sufficed
to
place
all
we
have
taken
so
long
to
describe
before
the
quick
-
sighted
Ironside
leader
.
<EOS>
He
looked
right
and
left
,
but
could
discern
no
trace
of
the
fugitive
,
and
yet
he
ought
to
be
in
view
.
<EOS>
The
dark
figure
near
the
White
Hawk
camp
could
not
possibly
be
him
.
<EOS>
The
spot
was
too
far
off
to
have
been
reached
.
<EOS>
But
Stelfax
did
not
pause
long
in
reflection
.
<EOS>
Dashing
down
the
hill
-
side
towards
the
shepherd
,
he
fiercely
demanded
whether
he
had
seen
a
horseman
pass
by
,
and
in
which
direction
he
had
ridden
.
<EOS>
“Oh
<EOS>
yes
,
I
seed
him
,
”
the
old
shepherd
replied
;
“
he
were
going
at
a
desperate
pace
for
sure
,
and
well
-
nigh
trampled
down
some
of
my
sheep
as
he
rode
through
the
flock
.
<EOS>
”“But
<EOS>
which
way
did
he
take
?
”
<EOS>
Stelfax
furiously
demanded
.
<EOS>
“
And
mark
me
,
thou
hoary
knave
!
<EOS>
I
read
deceit
in
thine
eye
.
<EOS>
Attempt
to
mislead
me
,
and
I
will
return
and
shoot
thee
down
with
as
little
scruple
as
I
would
the
cur
at
thy
heels
.
<EOS>
”“I
have
no
thought
to
deceive
you
,
honoured
captain
,
”
the
old
man
replied
,
in
a
voice
quavering
with
terror
.
<EOS>
“
The
person
you
be
searching
after
rode
off
by
yon
patch
of
gorse
.
”
<EOS>
Pointing
,
as
he
spoke
,
with
his
crook
towards
an
acclivity
on
the
north
-
west
.
<EOS>
Stelfax
tarried
not
a
moment
longer
,
but
galloped
off
with
his
men
in
the
direction
indicated
by
the
shepherd
.
<EOS>
The
brow
of
the
hill
was
covered
so
thickly
with
furze
that
it
was
impossible
to
pursue
a
straightforward
course
over
it
,
and
the
Ironsides
had
to
deviate
a
little
to
the
left
in
order
to
avoid
the
impediment
.
<EOS>
They
soon
,
however
,
crossed
the
summit
,
and
then
fresh
valleys
opened
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
New
downs
,
too
,
rose
before
them
,
varying
little
in
aspect
or
character
from
those
which
they
had
just
traversed
.
<EOS>
Though
the
summits
still
glowed
with
the
reflected
radiance
of
the
sky
,
the
coombs
looked
dull
and
sombre
;
but
there
was
no
positive
obscurity
,
and
as
Stelfax
plunged
his
gaze
into
the
hollows
,
he
failed
in
discovering
the
object
of
his
quest
.
<EOS>
On
either
hand
the
valleys
were
wide
and
extensive
,
and
the
sides
of
the
hills
bare
,
and
destitute
of
covert
sufficient
to
screen
the
fugitive
from
observation
.
<EOS>
The
valley
on
the
left
,
which
ran
in
a
northerly
direction
—
the
course
apparently
taken
by
the
fugitive
—
was
so
broad
and
open
,
that
,
had
the
flying
horseman
gone
that
way
<EOS>
,
he
must
have
been
at
once
distinguished
.
<EOS>
But
neither
on
the
right
or
on
the
left
could
he
be
seen
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
ascended
the
opposite
downs
,
he
must
necessarily
be
in
view
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
not
there
.
<EOS>
These
considerations
led
Stelfax
to
the
conclusion
that
he
must
have
found
some
place
of
concealment
,
and
his
suspicions
were
instantly
directed
to
a
small
holt
or
thicket
growing
near
the
foot
of
the
opposite
hill
,
which
would
offer
convenient
shelter
.
<EOS>
Satisfied
with
the
correctness
of
his
supposition
,
the
Roundhead
leader
at
once
give
directions
to
his
men
to
separate
,
and
approach
the
wood
in
such
manner
as
would
enable
them
most
completely
to
invest
it
.
<EOS>
The
injunctions
were
promptly
obeyed
,
Stelfax
himself
moving
off
a
little
to
the
left
,
and
then
mounting
the
hill
-
side
,
so
as
to
bring
himself
close
to
the
top
of
the
holt
which
straggled
slantingly
up
the
acclivity
.
<EOS>
These
precautionary
measures
taken
,
entrance
was
simultaneously
made
into
the
thicket
at
four
different
points
.
<EOS>
The
timber
of
which
the
holt
was
composed
consisted
almost
entirely
of
ash
,
hazel
,
and
oaks
.
<EOS>
None
of
the
trees
had
attained
any
great
size
,
and
being
planted
closely
together
—
much
too
closely
to
allow
free
growth
—
while
brambles
and
thorns
likewise
abounded
in
the
thicket
,
it
was
in
places
almost
impervious
.
<EOS>
The
crashing
of
branches
proclaimed
the
advance
of
the
Ironsides
,
and
more
than
one
pheasant
was
disturbed
by
them
.
<EOS>
But
as
yet
the
fugitive
had
not
been
detected
.
<EOS>
All
at
once
Stelfax
,
who
had
pushed
on
more
expeditiously
than
his
men
,
descried
the
horseman
hidden
in
the
depths
of
the
grove
.
<EOS>
Unable
to
repress
a
shout
of
exultation
at
the
sight
,
he
called
to
the
Cavalier
to
surrender
,
but
the
latter
replied
by
firing
a
pistol
at
him
:
the
thickly
intervening
trees
rendering
it
impossible
that
aim
could
be
taken
,
the
ball
lodged
in
the
trunk
of
an
adjoining
oak
.
<EOS>
The
Cavalier
then
turned
and
endeavoured
to
make
good
his
retreat
,
while
Stelfax
pressed
vigorously
after
him
,
shouting
to
his
men
to
intercept
him
.
<EOS>
But
it
soon
appeared
that
the
fugitive
was
quite
as
active
as
his
pursuers
,
and
understood
rather
better
than
they
did
how
to
make
his
way
through
a
tangled
thicket
.
<EOS>
He
dexterously
slipped
through
the
trees
,
while
the
fiery
haste
and
impetuosity
of
Stelfax
only
tended
to
his
own
disadvantage
.
<EOS>
The
Roundhead
leader
made
one
or
two
ineffectual
dashes
at
the
Cavalier
,
but
the
other
easily
avoided
him
,
and
,
guided
by
the
noise
made
by
the
advancing
troopers
,
he
likewise
managed
to
keep
out
of
their
way
.
<EOS>
This
adroit
mode
of
proceeding
soon
increased
the
distance
between
Stelfax
and
himself
,
and
enabled
him
to
obtain
a
considerable
start
ere
the
Roundhead
leader
and
his
men
could
extricate
themselves
from
the
holt
and
give
chase
.
<EOS>
Both
pursued
and
pursuers
now
went
along
at
a
headlong
pace
.
<EOS>
For
some
little
time
the
Cavalier
kept
in
the
valley
,
and
crossed
the
rough
and
ill
-
kept
road
leading
to
Lewes
.
<EOS>
At
that
time
there
was
no
direct
road
from
the
metropolis
to
Brightelmstone
,
and
only
the
deep
-
rutted
cart
-
road
just
mentioned
between
the
latter
place
and
Lewes
.
<EOS>
The
whole
district
being
perfectly
open
and
unenclosed
—
not
a
hedge
or
fence
existing
,
save
in
the
neighbourhood
of
some
sequestered
homestead
—
there
was
nothing
to
check
the
progress
either
of
the
fugitive
or
those
on
his
track
.
<EOS>
On
—
on
they
went
—
now
traversing
a
winding
valley
,
now
mounting
a
hill
—
anon
descending
to
another
dell
—
crossing
it
,
and
making
a
new
ascent
.
<EOS>
All
this
without
in
the
slightest
degree
relaxing
speed
.
<EOS>
The
Cavalier
seemed
in
no
wise
troubled
about
his
pursuers
,
feeling
confident
,
apparently
,
that
he
should
leave
them
behind
in
the
end
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
<EOS>
not
a
single
individual
had
been
encountered
.
<EOS>
The
downs
seemed
wholly
deserted
.
<EOS>
The
Cavalier
had
now
gained
the
summit
of
the
hill
on
which
the
ancient
encampment
called
Hollingsbury
Castle
may
be
traced
,
and
as
his
pursuers
were
not
more
than
half
way
up
the
hill
,
he
drew
in
the
rein
near
the
old
earthwork
,
to
breathe
his
panting
steed
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Seeing
him
pause
thus
,
Stelfax
and
his
men
hurried
on
;
but
ere
they
could
get
within
pistol
-
shot
,
he
speeded
off
down
the
smooth
turf
of
the
declivity
,
as
if
making
for
the
pretty
little
village
of
Preston
,
the
church
of
which
could
be
discerned
in
the
valley
,
about
half
a
mile
off
,
embosomed
in
trees
.
<EOS>
But
the
fugitive
,
it
soon
became
manifest
,
had
no
intention
of
entering
the
village
.
<EOS>
He
soon
struck
off
on
the
right
,
and
keeping
on
the
slopes
of
the
hill
until
he
had
passed
Patcham
and
its
hanging
wood
,
crossed
the
valley
now
traversed
by
the
railway
,
and
ascended
the
opposite
hill
.
<EOS>
Probably
,
he
had
conjectured
that
the
Ironsides
,
finding
their
efforts
to
come
up
with
him
fruitless
,
would
desist
from
further
pursuit
—
but
in
this
supposition
he
was
deceived
.
<EOS>
Stelfax
was
not
the
man
to
be
baffled
.
<EOS>
As
long
as
their
horses
could
carry
them
,
he
and
his
troopers
would
follow
—
and
though
their
steeds
were
not
so
swift
as
that
of
the
Cavalier
,
they
were
stronger
,
and
capable
of
greater
endurance
.
<EOS>
So
not
many
minutes
elapsed
ere
<EOS>
they
were
on
the
top
of
the
down
and
galloping
after
him
.
<EOS>
With
the
evident
intention
of
disembarrassing
himself
of
them
,
the
fugitive
now
led
them
into
all
sorts
of
difficult
places
,
and
practised
every
possible
manœuvre
to
shake
them
off
.
<EOS>
In
vain
.
<EOS>
They
still
held
on
;
while
the
stratagems
essayed
by
the
Cavalier
had
more
than
once
well
-
nigh
led
to
his
capture
.
<EOS>
It
was
after
a
mischance
of
this
kind
,
in
which
an
attempt
to
double
had
been
dexterously
checked
by
Stelfax
,
that
he
suddenly
changed
his
plan
,
and
once
more
set
off
straight
-
a
-
head
with
great
swiftness
.
<EOS>
They
were
now
upon
a
chain
of
downs
that
terminates
on
the
north
in
the
lofty
and
steep
escarpment
closely
adjoining
the
extraordinary
trench
popularly
known
as
the
Devil
’s
Dyke
.
<EOS>
It
was
towards
the
steepest
part
of
this
dangerous
declivity
that
the
Cavalier
now
rode
.
<EOS>
Perfectly
acquainted
with
the
country
,
as
the
result
proved
,
he
knew
whither
he
was
going
,
and
was
prepared
for
the
hazardous
feat
he
had
to
perform
.
<EOS>
Not
so
his
pursuers
.
<EOS>
This
precipitous
escarpment
,
which
stands
like
a
great
natural
bulwark
at
the
south
of
the
broad
Weald
of
Sussex
—
the
whole
of
that
immense
and
beautiful
tract
being
discernible
at
one
glance
from
it
—
slopes
suddenly
and
abruptly
down
,
without
the
slightest
interruption
to
the
valley
,
the
perilous
nature
of
the
descent
being
materially
increased
by
the
slippery
condition
of
the
turf
,
which
offers
,
at
dry
seasons
especially
,
a
very
insecure
footing
.
<EOS>
A
single
false
step
would
send
the
luckless
wight
who
made
it
sliding
to
the
foot
of
the
escarpment
in
double-
quick
time
.
<EOS>
On
the
brow
of
this
lofty
hill
are
the
remains
of
an
encampment
,
with
a
wide
ditch
and
a
rampart
surrounding
it
of
nearly
a
mile
in
circumference
.
<EOS>
Adjacent
to
this
camp
,
and
dividing
it
from
the
lower
range
of
downs
,
is
the
Dyke
.
<EOS>
Skirting
the
brink
of
this
remarkable
chasm
,
the
Cavalier
rode
on
,
and
passing
through
a
breach
in
the
outworks
of
the
camp
,
made
for
that
portion
of
the
rampart
which
overlooks
the
steepest
part
of
the
declivity
.
<EOS>
He
paused
not
for
a
moment
,
but
ere
reaching
the
verge
of
the
rampart
,
cast
a
glance
of
defiance
at
his
pursuers
.
<EOS>
Stelfax
,
at
that
instant
,
was
passing
through
the
breach
on
the
south
side
of
the
camp
.
<EOS>
Unaware
of
the
perilous
nature
of
the
feat
about
to
be
attempted
,
he
saw
the
Cavalier
spring
from
the
edge
of
the
rampart
,
and
plunge
down
the
descent
beyond
it
.
<EOS>
Intending
to
follow
him
,
the
Roundhead
officer
rode
on
,
but
as
he
neared
the
brink
of
the
declivity
,
and
its
precipitous
and
dangerous
character
became
fully
revealed
to
him
,
he
recoiled
,
and
drew
in
the
rein
with
such
force
that
he
almost
pulled
back
his
steed
upon
his
haunches
.
<EOS>
Just
in
time
!
<EOS>
In
another
instant
he
would
have
leaped
the
rampart
,
and
must
have
rolled
from
top
to
bottom
of
the
sharp
descent
.
<EOS>
Cautiously
approaching
the
edge
of
the
declivity
,
to
his
infinite
astonishment
and
vexation
he
beheld
the
bold
horseman
rapidly
descending
the
steep
escarpment
,
apparently
with
perfect
ease
and
security
.
<EOS>
The
rider
seemed
to
trust
himself
entirely
to
his
horse
,
not
attempting
to
direct
him
,
but
leaving
him
to
take
his
own
way
.
<EOS>
All
he
did
was
to
lean
back
as
much
as
he
could
in
the
saddle
to
avoid
sliding
out
of
it
on
to
the
horse
’s
shoulder
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
he
had
accomplished
nearly
half
the
descent
.
<EOS>
The
sight
stung
Stelfax
to
the
quick
.
<EOS>
His
prey
he
now
felt
would
escape
him
.
<EOS>
If
the
fugitive
should
reach
the
bottom
in
safety
,
his
escape
was
inevitable
.
<EOS>
Long
before
the
valley
could
be
gained
by
any
secure
descent
,
he
would
be
far
out
of
harm
’s
way
,
and
Stelfax
,
fearless
and
venturesome
as
he
was
,
did
not
like
to
essay
this
perilous
descent
,
not
deeming
his
horse
sufficiently
sure-
<EOS>
footed
to
accomplish
it
.
<EOS>
There
was
but
one
way
of
arresting
the
fugitive
.
<EOS>
Stelfax
took
a
pistol
from
his
holster
,
and
fired
.
<EOS>
His
mark
had
not
been
the
Cavalier
,
but
his
steed
.
<EOS>
The
ball
lodged
in
the
gallant
animal
’s
brain
.
<EOS>
Instantly
quitting
the
almost
sliding
posture
he
had
assumed
,
he
sprang
with
a
slight
bound
in
the
air
,
and
then
dropped
.
<EOS>
The
Cavalier
had
managed
to
disengage
himself
from
the
saddle
,
but
fell
in
the
attempt
,
and
could
not
recover
his
footing
.
<EOS>
He
and
his
slaughtered
steed
rolled
together
to
the
bottom
of
the
declivity
,
where
both
lay
motionless
.
<EOS>
“We
<EOS>
have
Abijam
now
—
dead
or
alive
,
”
cried
Stelfax
to
his
men
,
who
by
this
time
had
come
up
.
<EOS>
“
Mattathias
and
Enoch
go
ye
down
to
the
valley
by
yon
safe
though
circuitous
route
on
the
left
,
while
Nathan
Guestling
and
I
will
find
our
way
down
on
the
right
.
<EOS>
Lose
no
time
—
though
there
is
little
fear
that
our
prey
will
escape
us
now
.
<EOS>
He
hath
not
stirred
since
he
fell
,
and
I
fear
me
is
killed
outright
.

IIIOf
The
Guests
At
The
Poynings
’
ArmsON
reaching
the
valley
,
Stelfax
,
closely
followed
by
Nathan
Guestling
,
rode
towards
the
spot
where
the
luckless
Cavalier
was
lying
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
he
had
not
moved
;
but
when
the
Roundheads
drew
near
,
he
began
to
exhibit
some
symptoms
of
animation
,
and
made
an
effort
to
regain
his
feet
.
<EOS>
The
exertion
,
however
,
was
too
much
for
him
,
and
he
sank
back
with
a
groan
.
<EOS>
Flinging
himself
from
his
horse
,
and
giving
the
bridle
to
Guestling
,
Stelfax
bent
over
the
prostrate
Cavalier
,
and
carefully
studied
his
features
.
<EOS>
The
result
of
this
examination
was
by
no
means
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
The
person
under
his
scrutiny
was
some
ten
years
older
than
Charles
Stuart
,
though
his
slight
figure
and
swarthy
complexion
,
fine
black
eyes
,
and
long
dark
locks
,
had
given
him
a
general
resemblance
to
the
youthful
monarch
.
<EOS>
On
closer
inspection
,
however
,
the
likeness
vanished
,
and
the
stranger
’s
lineaments
were
found
to
be
different
in
many
points
from
those
of
the
king
.
<EOS>
Stelfax
gave
vent
to
his
disappointment
in
a
loud
and
angry
exclamation
,
and
called
out
to
the
two
other
troopers
,
who
rode
up
at
the
moment
,
that
it
was
not
Abijam
after
all
.
<EOS>
Hearing
what
passed
,
the
prostrate
Cavalier
raised
himself
upon
his
elbow
,
and
cried
,
“
<EOS>
So
you
took
me
for
the
king
—
ha
!
<EOS>
No
wonder
you
gave
me
so
hot
a
chase
.
<EOS>
Learn
to
your
confusion
that
his
Majesty
is
safe
from
pursuit
,
and
never
likely
to
fall
into
rebellious
hands
.
<EOS>
”“So
<EOS>
your
friend
,
Lord
Wilmot
,
affirmed
,
Sir
,
”
rejoined
Stelfax
;
“
but
I
attached
little
credit
to
his
assertion
,
and
I
attach
no
more
to
yours
.
<EOS>
You
are
my
prisoner
.
<EOS>
Under
what
name
and
title
<EOS>
do
you
surrender?”“It
is
my
pleasure
to
guard
my
incognito
as
long
as
I
can
,
”
the
Cavalier
replied
.
<EOS>
“
I
must
therefore
decline
to
furnish
you
with
my
name
.
<EOS>
As
to
title
,
I
have
none
.
<EOS>
”“You
are
too
modest
,
methinks
,
sir
,
”
Stelfax
cried
.
<EOS>
“
Remain
unknown
,
if
you
will
,
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
not
treated
with
the
consideration
due
to
your
rank
,
you
have
only
yourself
to
blame
.
<EOS>
”“I
have
no
rank
whatever
,
I
repeat
,
”
the
Cavalier
replied
.
<EOS>
“
I
am
but
a
simple
gentleman
—
and
a
very
poor
gentleman
into
the
bargain
—
thanks
to
the
fines
and
confiscations
of
your
State
Council
.
<EOS>
Will
one
of
your
men
lend
a
hand
to
lift
me
up?”“I
will
do
as
much
for
you
myself
,
sir
,
”
Stelfax
replied
,
helping
him
to
his
feet
.
<EOS>
“
I
hope
you
are
not
much
hurt?”“No
bones
are
broken
,
I
think
,
”
said
the
other
;
“
but
I
am
a
good
deal
shaken
.
<EOS>
You
gave
me
rather
an
awkward
tumble
down
the
hill
—
but
I
should
not
heed
that
if
my
horse
had
been
spared
,
”
glancing
,
as
the
words
were
uttered
,
with
great
commiseration
at
the
body
of
the
poor
animal
lying
stark
beside
him
.
<EOS>
“
He
was
a
gallant
steed
!
<EOS>
I
shall
never
get
such
another
.
<EOS>
”“A
<EOS>
brave
horse
,
in
sooth
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Stelfax
.
<EOS>
“
I
felt
sorry
to
despatch
him
—
but
I
must
have
shot
him
or
you
.
<EOS>
You
may
,
however
,
console
yourself
for
the
loss
by
reflecting
that
you
will
never
more
,
in
all
likelihood
,
require
his
services
.
<EOS>
”“That
is
but
cold
comfort
,
”
the
other
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
However
,
we
Cavaliers
are
not
accustomed
to
despair
,
even
at
the
foot
of
the
scaffold
.
<EOS>
I
hope
to
give
you
another
run
as
good
as
the
one
<EOS>
you
,
have
just
enjoyed
—
with
this
difference
only
,
that
on
the
next
occasion
you
may
be
left
in
the
lurch
.
<EOS>
”“Many
<EOS>
a
fox
-
chase
has
been
less
exciting
,
no
doubt
,
”
said
Stelfax
,
entering
into
the
jest
.
<EOS>
“
But
you
must
now
submit
to
be
searched
by
my
men
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
regret
that
the
measure
can
not
be
dispensed
with
—
but
my
orders
are
strict
.
<EOS>
All
letters
and
papers
must
be
sent
to
head
-
quarters
—
and
perhaps
I
may
learn
at
the
same
time
whom
I
have
the
honour
of
addressing
.
<EOS>
”Due
precautions
against
a
contingency
like
the
present
must
have
been
taken
by
the
Cavalier
,
since
only
a
few
unimportant
articles
were
found
upon
him
,
and
nothing
whatever
to
afford
a
clue
to
his
identity
.
<EOS>
Seeing
the
prisoner
look
very
faint
,
and
scarcely
able
to
stand
,
though
he
uttered
no
complaint
,
Stelfax
caused
him
to
be
lifted
on
to
the
croup
of
Nathan
Guestling
’s
horse
,
and
secured
by
a
broad
belt
passed
round
his
own
waist
and
that
of
the
stalwart
trooper
in
front
.
<EOS>
He
then
directed
Mattathias
and
Enoch
to
ride
one
on
either
side
of
the
captive
,
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
escape
,
and
set
off
for
a
hamlet
,
close
at
hand
,
where
he
made
sure
of
obtaining
restoratives
for
the
luckless
Royalist
.
<EOS>
The
place
for
which
the
Roundhead
captain
was
bound
was
Poynings
,
one
of
the
prettiest
and
most
picturesque
villages
amidst
the
South
Downs
,
and
then
remarkable
for
its
fine
old
manor
-
house
appertaining
to
the
baronial
family
that
took
its
name
from
the
place
,
as
well
as
for
its
antique
church
,
which
latter
still
exists
.
<EOS>
Night
was
now
coming
on
apace
,
but
the
sky
was
clear
,
and
the
light
of
the
heavenly
bodies
dispelled
the
darkness
.
<EOS>
The
hour
of
eight
was
tolled
out
as
the
little
troop
entered
Poynings
.
<EOS>
The
trampling
of
the
horses
quickly
roused
the
villagers
,
and
brought
them
to
the
doors
of
their
cottages
to
see
the
soldiers
pass
,
and
great
anxiety
was
evinced
to
obtain
a
glimpse
of
the
malignant
prisoner
.
<EOS>
But
no
near
approach
to
him
was
permitted
by
the
guard
,
and
the
curiosity
of
the
spectators
remained
unsatisfied
.
<EOS>
A
decent
hostelry
was
soon
found
near
the
church
,
and
here
Stelfax
alighted
,
and
caused
his
prisoner
,
who
was
unable
to
dismount
without
assistance
,
to
be
lifted
from
the
trooper
’s
horse
and
carried
inside
.
<EOS>
This
service
was
rendered
by
the
landlord
,
who
announced
himself
to
the
Roundhead
leader
as
Simon
Piddinghoe
,
of
the
Poynings
’
Arms
,
at
the
honourable
captain
’s
service
.
<EOS>
The
Cavalier
was
supported
by
the
assiduous
host
into
a
large
,
comfortable
-
looking
house
-
place
,
with
a
wood
fire
blazing
upon
the
hearth
—
deep
inglenooks
on
either
side
of
the
chimney
—
and
a
couple
of
cozy
benches
with
high
backs
calculated
to
keep
off
all
draught
advancing
far
into
the
room
,
with
a
long
and
strong
oak
table
between
them
.
<EOS>
On
these
high
-
backed
benches
some
nine
or
ten
guests
were
seated
,
smoking
and
quaffing
the
stout
amber
ale
,
the
mulled
sack
,
and
other
liquors
for
which
the
Poynings
’
Arms
was
famed
.
<EOS>
The
company
consisted
,
as
it
turned
out
,
of
the
village
schoolmaster
,
Master
Cisbury
Oldfirle
,
who
was
accounted
a
man
of
parts
and
erudition
,
and
who
,
at
all
events
,
considered
himself
such
—
two
or
three
other
inhabitants
of
the
village
of
the
better
class
—
and
a
brace
of
sturdy
farmers
from
the
neighbourhood
,
who
were
discussing
their
evening
pint
,
or
quart
,
as
it
might
be
,
before
going
home
to
their
dames
.
<EOS>
Besides
these
,
there
were
some
other
guests
—
nondescript
individuals
,
whose
precise
position
in
society
Simon
Piddinghoe
himself
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
assign
,
and
who
might
be
disbanded
Royalist
soldiers
,
gentlemen
out
-
at
-
elbows
from
drink
or
play
,
bankrupt
tradesmen
from
London
,
or
what
you
please
.
<EOS>
Shabby
roysterers
like
these
often
took
up
their
quarters
in
country
hostels
at
the
time
—
carefully
selecting
houses
where
good
liquor
and
a
good
bowling
-
green
were
to
be
found
;
and
notwithstanding
their
tarnished
lace
cloaks
,
threadbare
doublets
,
and
slouched
Spanish
hats
,
they
were
heartily
welcomed
by
mine
host
—
so
long
as
they
had
wherewithal
to
pay
the
shot
.
<EOS>
To
these
personages
the
arrival
of
the
Ironsides
seemed
to
afford
anything
but
satisfaction
,
though
they
endeavoured
to
put
a
good
face
upon
their
vexation
,
and
rose
with
the
rest
of
the
company
to
salute
the
Roundhead
captain
on
his
entrance
.
<EOS>
All
arose
but
one
—
a
fierce
,
swashbuckling
fellow
,
with
a
long
rapier
at
his
side
,
who
was
afterwards
addressed
by
the
host
as
Captain
Goldspur
.
<EOS>
With
a
muttered
oath
,
this
personage
pulled
his
slouched
hat
over
his
beetle
-
brows
,
shifted
himself
in
his
seat
,
and
turned
his
back
upon
Stelfax
.
<EOS>
As
the
captive
Cavalier
was
brought
into
the
room
,
and
the
light
of
the
fire
illumined
his
features
,
Simon
Piddinghoe
gave
a
slight
start
of
recognition
;
but
a
pressure
of
his
arm
by
the
prisoner
cautioned
him
to
hold
his
tongue
.
<EOS>
By
Stelfax
’s
directions
the
luckless
gentleman
was
accommodated
with
an
easy-
chair
near
the
fire
,
and
a
glass
of
strong
water
being
administered
to
him
by
the
host
,
he
speedily
began
to
revive
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
the
company
had
resumed
their
seats
,
though
the
questionable
individuals
we
have
described
were
evidently
ill
at
ease
,
and
Captain
Goldspur
,
who
puffed
away
furiously
at
his
pipe
,
looked
askance
at
Stelfax
from
beneath
his
heavy
brows
.
<EOS>
But
if
he
or
his
companions
meditated
any
attack
upon
the
Roundhead
leader
,
the
formidable
appearance
of
the
latter
served
to
restrain
them
.
<EOS>
Neither
was
Stelfax
unsupported
.
<EOS>
His
three
men
had
entered
the
room
and
seated
themselves
at
the
further
end
of
the
benches
,
ready
to
obey
their
captain
’s
slightest
behest
.
<EOS>
However
conversation
might
have
gone
on
before
the
arrival
of
the
Ironsides
,
it
flagged
now
—
the
only
person
who
maintained
his
character
for
loquacity
being
Cisbury
Oldfirle
.
<EOS>
He
talked
on
with
his
wonted
volubility
.
<EOS>
Undismayed
by
Stelfax
’s
stern
looks
,
he
entered
into
conversation
with
him
,
and
gave
him
many
particulars
concerning
the
ancient
family
of
Poynings
,
to
which
the
other
listened
with
some
degree
of
attention
,
and
then
inquired
whether
the
worshipful
captain
had
heard
the
legend
of
the
Devil
’s
Dyke
,
and
finding
—
as
might
be
expected
—
that
he
had
not
,
volunteered
to
relate
it
to
him
—
premising
that
he
could
not
entirely
vouch
for
its
authenticity
.
<EOS>
Having
been
supplied
by
the
assiduous
host
with
a
bottle
of
admirably
brewed
sack
,
Stelfax
felt
disposed
to
accord
the
talkative
pedagogue
his
attention
,
and
listened
with
more
patience
than
might
have
been
expected
to
the
weird
,
and
somewhat
extravagant
,
legend
which
will
be
found
narrated
—
almost
in
Master
Oldfirle
’s
own
language
—
in
the
next
chapter

Of
PoyningsTHE
wondrous
event
I
am
about
to
detail
happened
in
the
time
of
the
good
Saint
Cuthman
of
Steyning
,
in
this
county
—
a
holy
man
,
who
from
his
extraordinary
piety
and
austerity
was
believed
to
be
endowed
with
supernatural
power
.
<EOS>
Many
miracles
are
attributed
to
him
,
some
of
which
occurred
long
before
his
canonization
.
<EOS>
While
yet
a
boy
,
and
employed
in
tending
his
father
’s
sheep
on
the
downs
,
in
order
to
pursue
his
devotional
exercises
undisturbed
,
he
was
wo
nt
to
trace
a
large
circle
round
the
flock
with
his
crook
,
beyond
which
none
of
them
could
stray
,
neither
could
any
enemy
approach
them
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
the
good
saint
could
punish
the
scoffer
,
as
well
as
bless
and
sustain
the
lowly
and
the
well
-
doer
.
<EOS>
Derided
by
certain
blasphemous
haymakers
for
carrying
his
palsied
mother
in
a
barrow
—
no
better
means
of
conveyance
being
at
hand
at
the
time
—
he
brought
down
a
heavy
shower
upon
their
heads
,
rendering
their
labour
of
no
account
;
and
thenceforward
,
whenever
grass
was
cut
and
dried
within
that
meadow
,
rain
would
fall
upon
it
,
and
turn
it
to
litter
.
<EOS>
Such
was
holy
Cuthman
—
a
man
<EOS>
,
you
will
perceive
,
whom
it
was
necessary
to
treat
with
the
respect
due
to
his
exalted
virtues
.
<EOS>
At
a
later
period
of
the
saint
’s
life
,
when
his
aged
mother
had
gone
from
him
,
when
he
had
built
a
wooden
church
with
his
own
hands
at
Steyning
—
wherein
,
in
the
fulness
of
time
,
he
was
interred
—
and
when
his
reputation
for
sanctity
and
austerity
had
greatly
increased
,
causing
him
to
be
equally
reverenced
and
dreaded
—
dreaded
,
I
mean
,
by
evil
-
doers
,
to
whom
he
was
especially
obnoxious
—
the
holy
man
walked
forth
one
afternoon
,
in
early
autumn
,
wholly
unattended
,
across
the
downs
;
his
purpose
being
to
visit
a
recluse
,
named
Sister
Ursula
,
who
dwelt
in
a
solitary
cell
on
the
summit
of
a
hill
adjoining
Poynings
,
and
whom
he
had
been
told
was
sick
,
and
desirous
of
being
shriven
by
him
.
<EOS>
Now
Saint
Cuthman
had
his
staff
in
his
hand
,
without
which
he
never
journeyed
abroad
,
and
he
walked
on
until
he
reached
the
eminence
for
which
he
was
bound
.
<EOS>
On
the
brow
of
this
hill
in
former
times
the
heathen
invaders
of
the
land
had
made
a
camp
,
vestiges
of
which
may
still
be
discerned
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
with
these
memorials
of
a
bygone
and
benighted
people
that
Saint
Cuthman
concerned
himself
.
<EOS>
If
he
thought
about
the
framers
of
those
mighty
earthworks
at
all
,
it
was
with
thanksgiving
that
they
had
been
swept
away
,
and
had
given
place
to
a
generation
to
whom
the
purer
and
brighter
light
of
the
Gospel
was
vouchsafed
.
<EOS>
Thus
communing
with
himself
it
may
be
,
holy
Cuthman
reached
the
northern
boundary
of
the
rampart
surrounding
the
old
Roman
camp
,
and
cast
his
eyes
over
the
vast
Weald
of
Sussex
,
displayed
before
him
like
a
map
.
<EOS>
The
contemplation
of
this
fair
and
fertile
district
filled
his
soul
with
gladness
;
but
what
chiefly
rejoiced
him
was
to
note
how
the
edifices
reared
for
worship
had
multiplied
since
he
first
looked
upon
the
extensive
plain
.
<EOS>
He
strove
to
count
the
numerous
churches
scattered
about
,
but
soon
gave
up
the
attempt
—
he
might
as
well
have
tried
to
number
the
trees
.
<EOS>
But
the
difficulty
he
experienced
increased
his
satisfaction
,
inasmuch
as
it
proved
to
him
that
true
religion
had
taken
deep
root
in
the
land
.
<EOS>
And
he
gave
glory
and
praise
accordingly
,
where
glory
and
praise
are
due
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
were
his
audibly
-
uttered
thanksgivings
ended
,
when
he
became
aware
that
some
one
stood
nigh
him
,
and
turning
his
head
,
he
beheld
a
tall
man
of
singularly
swarthy
complexion
,
haughty
mien
,
and
eyes
that
seemed
to
burn
like
coals
of
fire
.
<EOS>
The
habiliments
of
this
mysterious
and
sinister
-
looking
personage
were
of
blood
-
red
hue
,
and
though
their
richness
and
the
egret
in
his
velvet
cap
betokened
princely
rank
,
he
bore
the
implements
of
a
common
labourer
—
namely
,
a
pickaxe
and
a
shovel
.
<EOS>
No
sound
had
proclaimed
the
stranger
’s
approach
,
and
his
appearance
was
as
sudden
and
startling
as
if
he
had
risen
from
the
earth
.
<EOS>
As
Saint
Cuthman
regarded
him
with
the
aversion
inspired
by
the
sight
of
a
venomous
and
deadly
snake
,
yet
wholly
without
fear
,
he
knew
that
he
was
in
the
presence
of
the
Author
of
III.“Comest
thou
to
tempt
me
,
accursed
one
?
”
<EOS>
the
holy
man
sternly
demanded
.
<EOS>
“
If
so
,
learn
that
I
am
proof
against
thy
wiles
.
<EOS>
Depart
from
me
,
or
I
will
summon
good
spirits
that
shall
cast
thee
hence
.
<EOS>
”“Thou
<EOS>
canst
not
do
so
,
”
the
inauspicious
-
looking
stranger
replied
,
laughing
derisively
.
<EOS>
“
I
am
master
here
.
<EOS>
Altars
have
been
reared
to
strange
gods
upon
this
hill
,
and
sacrifices
made
to
them;—nay
,
I
myself
have
been
worshipped
as
Dis
,
and
the
blood
of
black
bulls
has
been
poured
out
upon
the
ground
in
mine
honour
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
the
hill
is
mine
,
and
thou
thyself
art
an
intruder
upon
it
,
and
deservest
to
be
cast
down
headlong
into
the
plain
.
<EOS>
Yet
will
I
spare
thee—”“Thou
darest
not
so
much
as
injure
a
hair
of
my
head
,
Sathanas
,
”
interrupted
the
Saint
,
in
a
menacing
voice
,
and
raising
his
staff
as
he
spoke
.
<EOS>
“
Approach
!
<EOS>
and
lightnings
shall
blast
thee
.
<EOS>
”“I
tell
thee
<EOS>
I
have
no
design
to
harm
thee
,
”
returned
the
Fiend
,
with
a
look
that
showed
he
would
willingly
have
rent
the
holy
man
in
pieces
.
<EOS>
“
But
give
heed
to
what
I
am
about
to
say
.
<EOS>
Vainly
hast
thou
essayed
to
count
the
churches
in
the
Sussex
Weald
,
and
thou
hast
glorified
Heaven
because
of
the
number
of
the
worshippers
gathered
within
those
fanes
.
<EOS>
Now
mark
me
,
thou
servant
of
God
!
<EOS>
Thou
hast
taken
a
farewell
look
of
that
plain
,
so
thickly
studded
with
structures
pleasing
in
thy
sight
,
but
an
abomination
to
me
.
<EOS>
Before
to
-
morrow
morn
,
that
vast
district
—
far
as
thine
eye
can
stretch
—
even
to
the
foot
of
you
<EOS>
distant
Surrey
hills
—
the
whole
Weald
of
Sessex
,
with
its
many
churches
,
its
churchmen
,
and
its
congregations
,
shall
be
whelmed
beneath
the
sea
.
<EOS>
”“Thou
<EOS>
mockest
me
,
”
returned
Saint
Cuthman
,
contemptuously
;
“
but
I
know
thee
to
be
the
Father
of
Lies
.
”“Disbelieve
<EOS>
me
,
if
I
fail
in
my
task
—
not
till
then
,
”
said
the
Fiend
.
<EOS>
“
With
the
implements
which
I
hold
in
my
hand
I
will
cut
such
a
dyke
through
this
hill
,
and
through
the
hills
lying
between
it
and
Hove
,
as
shall
let
in
the
waters
of
the
deep
,
so
that
all
dwelling
within
yonder
plain
shall
be
drowned
by
them
.
<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
thinkest
thou
<EOS>
thy
evil
work
will
be
permitted
?
”
<EOS>
cried
the
Saint
,
shaking
his
head
.
<EOS>
“Thou
,
at
least
,
canst
not
prevent
it
,
”
rejoined
the
Fiend
,
with
a
bitter
laugh
.
<EOS>
“
I
will
take
my
chance
of
other
hindrance
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
holy
man
appeared
for
a
moment
troubled
,
but
his
confidence
was
presently
restored
.
<EOS>
“Thou
deceivest
thy
self
,
”
he
said
.
<EOS>
“
The
task
thou
proposest
to
execute
is
beyond
thy
power
.
”“Beyond
<EOS>
my
power
!
”
exclaimed
the
Demon
.
<EOS>
“
It
is
a
trifle
in
comparison
with
what
I
can
achieve
.
<EOS>
I
have
had
a
hand
in
many
wonderful
works
,
some
of
which
are
recognized
as
mine
,
though
I
have
not
got
credit
for
a
tithe
of
those
I
have
performed
.
<EOS>
Devil
’s
bridges
are
common
enough
,
methinks
,
in
mountainous
gorges
—
<EOS>
devil
’s
towers
are
by
no
means
rare
in
old
castles
.
<EOS>
Most
of
the
camps
upon
these
downs
were
planned
and
executed
by
me
—
the
very
rampart
upon
which
we
stand
being
partly
my
work
.
<EOS>
The
first
Cæsar
has
got
the
credit
of
many
of
my
performances
,
and
he
is
welcome
to
it

<EOS>
He
is
not
the
only
man

has
worn
laurels
belonging
by
right

Saint

thou
art
<EOS>

it
is
meet
<EOS>
thou
give
the
devil
his
due

Do
so

thou

needs
praise
his
industry

<EOS>
”“Thy
industry
in
evil
-
doing
in
unquestionable
,
”
rejoined
the
Saint
.
<EOS>
“
But
good
work
is
out
of
thy
power

<EOS>
Thou
darest
not
affirm
that
thou

the
erection

holy
piles

<EOS>
”“Ask

Saint

tell
thee
differently

<EOS>
But
I
disdain
to
boast

<EOS>
I
have
certainly
had
no

thy
ugly
little
wooden
church
at
Steyning

<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
thy
present
feat
is
to
be
performed
before

morrow

sayest

”
<EOS>
demanded
the
Saint
,
highly
offended
at
this
uncalled
-
for
allusion
to
his
own
favourite
structure
.
<EOS>
“Between
sunset
and
sunrise
,
most
saintly
sir
.
<EOS>
”“That
is
but
a
short
time
for
so
mighty

said
the
holy
man
,
in
an
incredulous
tone
.
<EOS>
“
Bethink
thee
a
September
night
is
not
a
long
night?”“The
shortest
night
is
long
enough
for
me

the
Fiend
replied
.
<EOS>
“
If
the
dawn
comes
and
finds
my
work
incomplete
,
thou
shalt
be
at
liberty
to
deride
me
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
shall
never
treat
thee
otherwise
than
with
scorn
,
”
the
Saint
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
But
thou
hast
said
it
,
and
I
hold
thee
to
thy
word

<EOS>
Between
sunset
and
sunrise
thy
task
must
be
done
.
<EOS>
If
thou
failest
—
from
whatever
cause

thy
evil

”“Be
<EOS>
it
<EOS>
so

<EOS>
I

the
Fiend
rejoined

<EOS>
“
But
I
shall
not

he
added
,
with
a
fearful
laugh

<EOS>
“
Come
hither
at

thou

see
me

<EOS>
Thou

nigh
me

”“Heaven
<EOS>
forfend
that
it
should
be
done

”
<EOS>
ejaculated
the
Saint
,
casting
his
eyes
upwards
.
<EOS>
When
he
looked
up
again
towards
the
spot
where
the
Evil
one
had
stood
,
he
could
no
more
perceive
him
.
<EOS>
“No
!
<EOS>
”
exclaimed
the
good
Saint
,
allowing
his
gaze
to
wander
over
the
smiling
and
far
-
stretching
Weald
,
“
I
can
not
believe
that
I
am
taking
farewell
of
this
lovely
plain
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
for
an
instant
believe
that
its
destruction
will
be
permitted
.
<EOS>
Its
people
have
not
sinned
,
but
have
incurred
the
hatred
of
the
Arch-
Fiend
solely
because
of
their
piety
and
zeal
.
<EOS>
It
shall
be
my
business
to
defeat
his
hateful
design
.
<EOS>
The
holy
man
turned
away
,
and
quitting
the
camp
,
proceeded
in
an
easterly
direction
over
the
hill
,
until
he
came
to
a
small
stone
structure
,
standing
near
a
grey
old
thorn
-
tree
,
on
an
acclivity
covered
with
gorse
and
heather
.
<EOS>
The
occupant
of
this
solitary
cell
belonged
to
a
priory
of
Benedictine
nuns
,
situated
at
Leominster
,
near
Arundel
,
and
attached
to
the
Abbey
of
Almenesches
,
in
Normandy
.
<EOS>
Sister
Ursula
Braose
had
retired
to
this
lonesome
spot
in
order
to
pass
the
whole
of
her
time
in
devotion
,
and
had
acquired
a
reputation
for
sanctity
and
asceticism
scarcely
inferior
to
that
of
holy
Cuthman
himself
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
daughter
of
the
noble
house
of
Braose
of
Bramber
Castle
.
<EOS>
Once
a
week
the
purveyor
of
the
priory
at
Leominster
brought
her
a
scanty
supply
of
provisions
(
for
the
poor
soul
needed
but
little
)
,
and
it
was
from
him
that
Saint
Cuthman
had
heard
of
her
illness
,
and
of
her
desire
to
be
shriven
by
him
.
<EOS>
He
found
the
recluse
occupied
in
her
devotions
.
<EOS>
She
was
kneeling
before
an
ivory
crucifix
fastened
against
the
wall
of
her
cell
,
and
was
so
absorbed
as
to
be
entirely
unconscious
of
the
Saint
’s
approach
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
make
his
presence
known
to
her
till
she
had
done
.
<EOS>
Sister
Ursula
Braose
had
once
been
remarkable
for
beauty
,
but
years
,
the
austere
life
she
had
led
,
and
the
frequent
and
severe
penances
she
had
undergone
,
had
obliterated
all
traces
of
loveliness
from
her
features
.
<EOS>
She
was
old
and
wrinkled
now
;
her
hair
white
as
snow
,
and
her
fingers
thin
as
those
of
a
skeleton
.
<EOS>
She
was
clothed
in
a
loose
black
robe
,
with
a
cincture
of
cord
round
her
waist
.
<EOS>
Reverentially
saluting
the
holy
man
,
she
prayed
him
to
be
seated
upon
a
stool
,
which
,
with
another
small
seat
hewn
out
of
stone
,
a
stone
table
,
and
a
straw
pallet
,
formed
the
entire
furniture
of
her
cell
.
<EOS>
An
iron
lamp
hung
by
a
chain
from
the
roof
.
<EOS>
On
the
table
were
placed
a
missal
written
on
vellum
,
an
hour
-
glass
,
and
a
small
taper
.
<EOS>
After
inquiring
as
to
her
ailments
,
and
expressing
his
satisfaction
that
she
felt
somewhat
better
,
Saint
Cuthman
said
,
“
Are
you
still
fasting
,
sister
?
<EOS>
I
know
you
are
wo
nt
only
to
break
bread
and
drink
water
after
the
hour
of
vespers
.
”“Since
<EOS>
yestere’en
<EOS>
,
nothing
has
passed
my
lips
,
holy
father
,
”
the
recluse
replied
.
<EOS>
“It
is
well
,
”
said
the
Saint
.
<EOS>
“
The
prohibition
I
am
about
to
lay
upon
you
—
painful
to
any
other
,
unaccustomed
to
severe
mortification
of
the
flesh
—
will
by
you
be
scarcely
accounted
a
penance
.
<EOS>
I
enjoin
you
to
refrain
from
all
refreshment
of
the
body
,
whether
by
food
or
rest
,
until
to

morrow
morning

<EOS>
Think
you
,
you
can
promise
compliance
with
the
order?”“Do
<EOS>
I
think
it
,
holy
father
?
”
<EOS>
Sister
Ursula
cried
.
<EOS>
“
If
Heaven
will
spare
me
so
long
,
I
am
sure
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
was
in
hopes
,
”
she
added
,
almost
with
a
look
of
disappointment
,
“
that
you
were
about
to
enjoin
me
some
severe
discipline
,
such
as
my
sinfulness
merits

and
I
pray
you
to
add
sharp
flagellations
,
or
other
wholesome
correction
of
the
flesh
,
to
your
mandate
.
<EOS>
”“Nay
,
”
rejoined
the
Saint
,
smiling
at
the
recluse
’s
zeal
;
“
the
scourge
is
unneeded
.
<EOS>
You
have
no
heavy
offence
,
I
am
well
assured
,
on
your
conscience
.
<EOS>
But
keep
strict
vigil
throughout
the
night
,
and
suffer
not
sleep
to
weigh
down
your
eyelids
for
a
moment
,
or
you
may
be
exposed
to
temptation
and
danger
.
<EOS>
The
Arch-
Fiend
himself
will
be
abroad
.
<EOS>
”“I
will
spend
the
livelong
night
in
prayer
,
”
said
Sister
Ursula
,
trembling
.
<EOS>
“Fear
nothing
<EOS>
,
”
returned
the
Saint
;
“
the
Prince
of
Darkness
has
other
business
on
hand
,
and
will
not
trouble
you
.
<EOS>
He
will
be
engaged
in
a
terrible
work
,
but
,
with
Heaven
’s
aid
,
good
sister
,
yours
shall
be
the
hand
to
confound
him
.
<EOS>
”“Mine
!
”
exclaimed
the
recluse
,
seeking
by
her
looks
for
an
explanation
from
the
holy
man
.
<EOS>
“When
the
sun
hath
gone
down
,
”
rejoined
Saint
Cuthman
,
“
which
will
be
about
the
seventh
hour

turn
this
hour

glass

and
let
the
sand
run
out
six
times

six
times

do
you
mark

good
sister

<EOS>
That
will
bring
you
to
the
first
hour
after
midnight

<EOS>
Kneel
then
before
yon
crucifix
and
pray
fervently
,

the
dark

him

took
our

this

which
I
will
presently
consecrate
;
set
it
within
the
bars
of
that
little
grated
window
looking
towards
the
east
,
and
pray
that
its
glimmer
may
be
as
the
first
grey
light
of
dawn
.
<EOS>
Again
,
I
say
,
do
you
mark
me
,
sister?”“Not
a
word
uttered
by
you
,
holy
father
,
but
hath
sunk
deep
in
my
breast
,
”
she
replied
.
<EOS>
“
Your
instructions
shall
be
scrupulously
obeyed
.
”“Nothing
<EOS>
evil
shall
cross
this
threshold
during
the
night
,
”
pursued
the
Saint
.
<EOS>
“
I
will
guard
it
as
,
<EOS>
in
the
days
of
my
youth
,
I
guarded
my
father
’s
flocks
on
the
hills
.
<EOS>
Light
not
your
lamp
but
only
the
taper
,
as
I
have
bidden
you
;
and
stir
not
forth
on
any
threat
or
summons
,
for
such
will
only
be
a
snare
to
injure
you
;
and
let
not
your
heart
quail
because
of
the
frightful
sounds
you
may
hear
.
<EOS>
Though
the
earth
should
quake
beneath
your
feet
,
and
this
solid
hill
tremble
to
its
foundations
,
yet
shall
not
a
stone
of
your
cell
be
removed
,
neither
shall
any
harm
befall
you
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
Saint
then
took
up
the
taper
,
and
blessed
it
in
these
terms
:
<EOS>
“
Domine
Jesu
Christi
,
fili
Dei
vivi
,
benedic
candelam
istam
supplicationibus
nostris
:
infunde
ei
,
Domine
,
per
virtutem
sanctœ
crucis
benedictionem
cœlestem
;
<EOS>
ut
quibuscumque
locis
accensa
,
sive
posita
fuerit
,
discedant
principes
tenebrarum
,
et
contremiscant
,
et
fugiunt
pavidi
cum
omnibus
ministris
suis
ab
habitationibus
illis
;
nec
prœsumant
amplius
inquietare
,
aut
molestare
servientes
tibi
omnipotenti
Deo
.
<EOS>
”After
going
through
certain
other
ceremonials
,
which
it
is
needless
to
describe
,
the
Saint
sat
down
,
and
addressing
Sister
Ursula
,
declared
his
readiness
to
shrive
her
.
<EOS>
The
recluse
then
knelt
down
before
him
,
and
inclining
her
head
so
as
to
conceal
her
features
,
said
she
had
one
secret
within
her
breast
which
she
had
never
revealed
to
her
confessor
—
one
sin
upon
her
soul
,
of
which
she
had
never
been
able
to
repent
.
<EOS>
After
duly
reproving
her
,
the
Saint
told
her
to
make
clean
her
breast
by
confession
,
declaring
she
would
then
be
able
to
repent
.
<EOS>
Thus
exhorted
,
Sister
Ursula
replied
,
in
accents
half
suffocated
by
irrepressible
emotion
:
“
My
secret
is
,
that
I
loved
you
—
you
,
holy
father
—
when
I
was
young
:
my
unrepented
sin
is
,
that
I
have
never
been
able
to
banish
that
love
from
my
heart
.
<EOS>
”“Alas
!
<EOS>
sister
,
”
rejoined
the
holy
man
,
trembling
in
spite
of
himself
,
“
we
have
been
equally
unhappy
.
<EOS>
In
days
,
long
gone
by
,
I
could
not
behold
unmoved
the
charms
of
the
fair
and
noble
Lady
Ursula
Braose
.
<EOS>
But
I
conquered
the
passion
,
and
repented
that
I
had
ever
indulged
it
.
<EOS>
Thou
must
do
likewise
.
<EOS>
The
struggle
may
be
hard
,
but
strength
will
be
given
thee
for
it
.
<EOS>
Hast
thou
aught
more
to
confess?”And
the
poor
recluse
,
who
shed
abundance
of
tears
,
replying
in
the
negative
,
the
Saint
gave
her
absolution
,
saying
that
the
penance
he
had
already
enjoined
was
sufficient
,
and
that
ere
the
morrow
<EOS>
her
breast
would
be
free
from
its
load
.
<EOS>
Struck
by
her
looks
,
which
were
those
of
one
not
long
for
this
world
,
he
told
her
that
if
her
sickness
should
prove
mortal
,
dirges
and
trentals
should
be
said
for
the
repose
of
her
soul
.
<EOS>
The
recluse
thanked
him
,
and
after
a
while
became
composed
and
even
cheerful
.
<EOS>
Saint
Cuthman
tarried
in
the
cell
,
discoursing
with
her
upon
the
glorious
prospects
of
futurity
,
and
carefully
avoiding
any
reference
to
the
past
,
until
,
from
the
door
of
the
little
structure
,
which
opened
toward
the
west
,
he
beheld
the
sun
sink
into
the
sea
.
<EOS>
Telling
the
good
sister
that
a
thousand
lives
depended
upon
her
vigilance
,
he
gave
her
his
benediction
and
departed
,
never
more
to
behold
her
alive
.
<EOS>
As
he
took
his
way
towards
the
north
-
eastern
boundary
of
the
ancient
encampment
,
a
noise
resembling
thunder
smote
his
ear
,
and
the
ground
shook
so
violently
beneath
his
feet
that
he
could
scarcely
stand
,
but
reeled
to
and
fro
,
as
if
his
brain
—
his
!
<EOS>
whose
lips
no
drink
stronger
than
water
had
ever
passed
—
had
been
assailed
by
the
fumes
of
wine
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
he
went
on
,
and
,
after
a
while
,
reached
the
lofty
headland
overlooking
Poynings
.
<EOS>
Here
,
as
he
expected
,
he
beheld
the
Arch
-
Fiend
at
work
.
<EOS>
The
infernal
excavator
had
already
made
a
great
breach
into
the
down
,
and
enormous
fragments
of
chalk
and
flint
-
stones
rolled
down
with
a
terrific
crash
,
like
that
caused
by
an
avalanche
amidst
the
Alps
.
<EOS>
Every
stroke
of
his
terrible
pickaxe
shook
the
hill
to
its
centre
.
<EOS>
No
one
,
who
was
not
sustained
by
supernatural
power
,
could
have
stood
firmly
upon
the
quaking
headland
.
<EOS>
But
Saint
Cuthman
,
planting
his
staff
upon
the
ground
,
remained
unmoved
—
the
only
human
witness
of
the
astounding
scene
.
<EOS>
The
Fiend
’s
proportions
had
now
become
colossal
,
and
he
looked
like
one
of
that
giant
race
whom
poets
of
heathendom
tell
us
warred
against
Jove
.
<EOS>
His
garb
was
suited
to
his
task
,
and
resembled
that
of
a
miner
.
<EOS>
His
brawny
and
hirsute
arms
were
bared
to
the
shoulder
,
and
the
curled
goat’s
-
horns
were
visible
on
his
uncovered
head
.
<EOS>
His
implements
had
become
enormous
as
himself
,
and
the
broadest
and
heaviest
anchor
-
fluke
ever
forged
was
as
nought
to
the
curved
iron
head
of
his
pickaxe
.
<EOS>
Each
stroke
plunged
fathom
-
deep
into
the
ground
,
and
tore
up
huge
boulder
-
like
masses
of
chalk
,
the
smallest
of
which
might
have
loaded
a
wain
.
<EOS>
The
Fiend
worked
away
with
might
and
main
,
and
the
concussion
produced
by
his
tremendous
strokes
was
incessant
and
terrible
,
echoing
far
over
the
Weald
like
the
rattling
of
a
dreadful
thunderstorm
.
<EOS>
But
the
sand
ran
out
,
and
Sister
Ursula
turned
her
glass
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
the
Fiend
stopped
,
and
clapped
his
hand
to
his
side
,
as
if
in
pain
—
”
A
sharp
stitch
!
”
<EOS>
quoth
he
.
<EOS>
“
My
side
tingles
as
if
pricked
by
a
thousand
pins
.
<EOS>
The
sensation
is
by
no
means
pleasant
—
but
‘
twill
soon
pass
!
”
<EOS>
Then
perceiving
the
Saint
watching
him
,
he
called
out
derisively
—
”
<EOS>
Aha
!
<EOS>
art
thou
there
,
thou
<EOS>
saintly
man
?
<EOS>
What
thinkest
thou
now
of
the
chance
of
escape
for
thy
friends
in
the
Weald
?
<EOS>
Thou
art
<EOS>
a
judge
of
such
matters
<EOS>
,
I
doubt
not
.
<EOS>
Is
my
Dyke
broad
enough
and
profound
enough
,
thinkest
thou
—
or
shall
I
widen
it
and
deepen
it
yet
more
?
”
<EOS>
And
the
chasm
resounded
with
his
mocking
laughter
.
<EOS>
“Thou
art
but
a
slovenly
workman
,
after
all
,
”
remarked
Saint
Cuthman
.
<EOS>
“
The
sides
of
thy
Dyke
are
rough
and
uneven
,
and
want
levelling
.
<EOS>
A
mortal
labourer
would
be
shrewdly
reprimanded
if
he
left
them
in
such
an
untidy
condition
.
<EOS>
”“No
<EOS>
mortal
labourer
could
make
such
a
trench
,
”
cried
the
Fiend
.
<EOS>
“
However
,
it
shall
never
be
said
that
I
am
a
slovenly
workman
.
<EOS>
”Whereupon
<EOS>
he
seized
his
spade
,
and
proceeded
to
level
the
banks
of
the
Dyke
,
carefully
removing
all
roughness
and
irregularity
.
<EOS>
“Will
<EOS>
that
satisfy
thy
precise
notions
?
”
<EOS>
he
called
out
,
when
he
had
done
.
<EOS>
“I
can
not
deny
that
it
looks
better
,
”
returned
the
holy
man
,
glad
to
think
that
another
hour
had
passed
—
for
a
soft
touch
falling
upon
his
brow
made
him
aware
that
,
at
this
moment
,
Sister
Ursula
had
turned
the
hour
-
glass
for
the
second
time
.
<EOS>
A
sharp
sudden
pain
smote
the
Fiend
,
and
made
him
roar
out
lustily
,
“
Another
stitch
,
and
worse
than
the
first
!
<EOS>
But
it
shall
not
hinder
my
task
.
<EOS>
”Again
<EOS>
he
fell
to
work
.
<EOS>
Again
,
the
hill
was
shaken
to
its
base
.
<EOS>
Again
,
mighty
masses
of
chalk
were
hurled
into
the
valley
,
crushing
everything
upon
which
they
descended
.
<EOS>
Again
,
the
strokes
of
the
pickaxe
echoed
throughout
the
Weald
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
dark
.
<EOS>
But
the
fiery
breath
of
the
Demon
sufficed
to
light
him
in
his
task
.
<EOS>
He
toiled
away
with
right
good
will
,
for
the
Devil
can
work
hard
enough
<EOS>
,
I
promise
you
,
if
the
task
be
to
his
mind
.
<EOS>
All
at
once
he
suspended
his
labour
.
<EOS>
The
hourglass
had
been
turned
for
the
third
time
.
<EOS>
“What
is
the
matter
with
thee
?
”
demanded
the
Saint
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
know
not
,
”
replied
the
writhing
Fiend
.
<EOS>
“
A
sudden
attack
of
cramp
in
the
arms
and
legs
<EOS>
,
I
fancy
.
<EOS>
I
must
have
caught
cold
on
these
windy
downs
.
<EOS>
I
will
do
a
little
lighter
work
till
the
fit
passes
off
.
”
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
he
took
up
the
shovel
and
began
to
trim
the
sides
of
the
Dyke
as
before
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
thus
engaged
,
the
further
end
of
the
chasm
closed
up
,
so
that
when
he
took
up
the
pickaxe
once
more
he
had
all
his
work
to
do
again
.
<EOS>
This
caused
him
to
snort
and
roar
like
a
mad
bull
,
and
so
much
flame
and
smoke
issued
from
his
mouth
and
nostrils
,
that
the
bottom
of
the
Dyke
resembled
the
bed
of
a
volcano
.
<EOS>
Sister
Ursula
then
turned
the
glass
for
the
fourth
time
.
<EOS>
Hereupon
,
an
enormous
mass
of
breccia
,
or
gold
-
stone
,
as
the
common
folk
call
it
,
which
the
Fiend
had
dislodged
,
rolled
down
upon
his
foot
,
and
crushed
it
.
<EOS>
This
so
enraged
him
,
that
he
sent
the
fragment
of
gold
-
stone
whizzing
over
the
hills
to
Hove
.
<EOS>
What
with
rubbing
his
bruised
foot
,
and
roaring
,
a
quarter
of
an
hour
elapsed
before
he
could
resume
his
work
.
<EOS>
The
fifth
turning
of
the
glass
gave
him
such
pains
in
the
back
,
that
for
some
minutes
he
was
completely
disabled
.
<EOS>
“An
attack
of
lumbago
,
”
he
cried
.
<EOS>
“
I
seem
liable
to
all
mortal
ailments
to-
night
.
<EOS>
”“Thou
hadst
better
desist
,
”
said
the
Saint
.
<EOS>
“
The
next
attack
may
cripple
thee
for
all
time
.
<EOS>
”“I
am
all
right
again
,
”
shouted
the
Demon
.
<EOS>
“
It
was
but
a
passing
seizure
,
like
those
that
have
gone
before
it
.
<EOS>
Thou
shalt
now
see
what
I
can
do
.
<EOS>
”And
<EOS>
he
began
to
ply
his
pickaxe
with
greater
energy
than
ever
;
toiling
on
without
intermission
,
filling
the
chasm
with
flame
from
his
fiery
nostrils
,
and
producing
the
effect
of
a
continuous
thunderstorm
over
the
Weald
.
<EOS>
Thus
he
wrought
on
,
I
say
,
uninterruptedly
,
for
the
space
of
another
hour
.
<EOS>
Sister
Ursula
had
turned
the
glass
for
the
last
time
.
<EOS>
The
Fiend
was
suddenly
checked
—
but
not
this
time
by
pains
in
the
limbs
,
or
prostration
of
strength
.
<EOS>
He
had
struck
the
pickaxe
so
deeply
into
the
chalk
that
he
could
not
remove
it
.
<EOS>
He
strained
every
nerve
to
pluck
it
forth
,
but
it
continued
firmly
embedded
,
and
the
helve
,
which
was
thick
as
the
mainmast
of
a
ship
,
and
of
toughest
oak
,
broke
in
his
grasp
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
roaring
like
an
infuriated
lion
with
rage
and
mortification
,
Saint
Cuthman
called
out
to
him
to
come
forth
.
<EOS>
“Wherefore
<EOS>
should
I
come
forth
?
”
<EOS>
the
Fiend
cried
.
<EOS>
“
Thou
thinkest
I
am
baffled
;
but
thou
art
mistaken
.
<EOS>
I
will
dig
out
my
axe
-
head
presently
,
and
my
shovel
will
furnish
me
with
a
new
handle
.
”“Cease
,
if
thou
canst
,
for
a
short
space
,
to
breathe
forth
flame
and
smoke
;
and
look
towards
the
east
,
”
cried
the
Saint
.
<EOS>
“There
is
a
glimmer
of
light
in
the
sky
in
that
quarter
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
Demon
,
holding
his
breath
;
“
but
dawn
can
not
be
come
already
.
<EOS>
”“The
streak
of
light
grows
rapidly
wider
and
brighter
,
”
said
the
Saint
.
<EOS>
“
The
shades
of
night
are
fleeing
fast
away
.
<EOS>
The
larks
are
beginning
to
rise
and
carol
forth
their
matin
hymns
on
the
downs
.
<EOS>
The
rooks
are
cawing
amid
the
trees
of
the
park
beneath
us
.
<EOS>
The
cattle
are
lowing
in
the
meads
—
and
hark
!
<EOS>
dost
thou
not
hear
the
cooks
crowing
in
the
adjacent
village
of
Poynings?”“Cocks
crowing
at
Poynings
!
”
<EOS>
yelled
the
Fiend
.
<EOS>
“
It
must
be
the
dawn
.
<EOS>
But
the
sun
shall
not
behold
my
discomfiture
.
<EOS>
”“Hide
<EOS>
thy
head
in
darkness
,
accursed
being
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
Saint
,
raising
his
staff
.
<EOS>
“
Hence
with
thee
!
<EOS>
and
return
not
to
this
hill
.
<EOS>
The
dwellers
within
the
Sussex
Weald
are
saved
from
thy
malice
,
and
may
henceforth
worship
without
fear
.
<EOS>
Get
thee
hence
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
”Abashed
by
the
awful
looks
of
the
Saint
,
the
Demon
fled
.
<EOS>
Howling
with
rage
,
like
a
wild
beast
robbed
of
its
prey
,
he
ran
to
the
northern
boundary
of
the
rampart
surrounding
the
camp
,
where
the
marks
of
his
gigantic
feet
may
still
be
seen
indelibly
impressed
on
the
sod
.
<EOS>
Then
springing
off
,
and
unfolding
his
sable
pinions
,
he
soared
over
the
Weald
,
alighting
on
Leith
Hill
.
<EOS>
Just
as
he
took
flight
,
Sister
Ursula
’s
taper
went
out
.
<EOS>
Instant
darkness
fell
upon
the
hill
,
and
Night
resumed
her
former
sway
.
<EOS>
The
village
cocks
ceased
crowing
,
the
larks
paused
in
their
songs
and
dropped
to
the
ground
like
stones
,
the
rooks
returned
to
roost
,
and
the
lowing
herds
became
silent
.
<EOS>
Saint
Cuthman
had
to
make
a
considerable
circuit
to
reach
Sister
Ursula
’s
cell
,
a
deep
gulf
having
been
placed
between
it
and
the
headland
on
which
he
had
taken
his
stand
.
<EOS>
On
arriving
at
the
little
structure
he
found
that
the
recluse
’s
troubles
were
over
Her
loving
heart
had
for
ever
ceased
to
beat
.
<EOS>
Her
failing
strength
had
sufficed
to
turn
the
hour
-
glass
for
the
last
time
,
and
just
as
the
consecrated
taper
expired
,
she
passed
away
.
<EOS>
In
death
,
she
still
retained
the
attitude
of
prayer
—
her
clasped
hands
being
raised
heavenwards
.
<EOS>
“Suspice
Domine
,
preces
nostras
pro
animâ
famulœ
tuœ
;
ut
si
quœ
ei
maculœ
de
terrenis
contagiis
adhœserunt
,
remissionis
tuœ
misericordia
deleantur
!
”
<EOS>
ejaculated
the
holy
man
.
<EOS>
“
She
could
not
have
had
a
better
ending
!
<EOS>
May
my
own
be
like
it
!
<EOS>
She
shall
have
sepulture
in
my
mother
’s
grave
at
Steyning
.
<EOS>
And
masses
and
trentals
,
according
to
my
promise
,
shall
be
said
for
the
repose
of
her
soul
.
<EOS>
Peace
be
with
her
!
”
<EOS>
And
he
went
on
his
way
.
<EOS>
Thus
was
the
Demon
banished
by
Saint
Cuthman
from
that
hill
overlooking
the
fair
Sussex
Weald
,
and
the
people
of
the
plain
ever
after
prayed
in
peace
.
<EOS>
But
the
Devil
’s
handiwork
—
the
unfinished
Dyke
—
exists
to
this
day
.
<EOS>
Though
I
never
heard
that
his
pickaxe
has
been
found
.

CHAPTER
VHow
Stelfax
Took
The
Cavalier
To
The
Grange;And
<EOS>
What
Happened
By
The
WaySOME
few
interruptions
were
offered
to
the
schoolmaster
’s
narration
both
by
Stelfax
and
his
men
;
and
when
it
came
to
an
end
,
the
Roundhead
leader
observed
that
it
was
a
monkish
and
superstitious
legend
,
fit
only
for
old
wives
and
children
,
and
that
for
his
own
part
he
did
not
believe
in
the
pretended
miracles
of
Saint
Cuthman
,
or
those
of
any
other
Romish
saint
in
the
calendar
.
<EOS>
On
this
observation
being
made
,
Captain
Goldspur
got
up
,
and
looking
as
if
he
would
no
longer
remain
in
the
company
of
a
person
who
expressed
such
heterodox
opinions
,
he
was
marching
out
of
the
room
,
when
,
at
a
sign
from
Stelfax
,
two
of
the
troopers
caught
hold
of
him
,
and
forced
him
back
to
his
seat
.
<EOS>
In
doing
this
,
they
deprived
him
of
his
long
rapier
,
which
Stelfax
consigned
to
the
host
,
bidding
him
put
it
aside
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
In
an
authoritative
tone
the
Roundhead
leader
then
informed
the
company
that
none
of
them
must
leave
the
house
until
after
his
departure
with
the
prisoner
—
a
piece
of
good
news
to
Simon
Piddinghoe
,
who
ventured
to
express
a
hope
that
the
worshipful
captain
would
prolong
his
stay
to
as
late
an
hour
as
possible
.
<EOS>
Stelfax
,
indeed
,
seemed
in
no
hurry
to
depart
.
<EOS>
His
seat
by
the
fireside
was
very
comfortable
,
and
the
mulled
sack
super
-
excellent
—
so
remarkably
good
,
indeed
,
that
,
having
finished
his
pottle
during
the
progress
of
the
schoolmaster
’s
legend
,
he
ordered
the
host
to
brew
a
second
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
the
prisoner
had
shaken
off
in
a
great
measure
the
effects
of
his
fall
.
<EOS>
Of
a
reckless
turn
,
like
most
Cavaliers
,
he
either
felt
—
or
feigned
to
feel
—
indifferent
to
his
present
position
.
<EOS>
His
chair
was
next
that
of
Stelfax
,
and
hearing
the
praises
bestowed
by
the
latter
upon
the
sack
,
he
begged
to
be
allowed
a
measure
for
himself
—
and
the
favour
was
unhesitatingly
granted
.
<EOS>
After
the
failure
of
his
attempt
to
march
off
,
Captain
Goldspur
’s
audacity
seemed
to
forsake
him
,
and
withdrawing
as
far
as
he
could
from
the
presence
of
the
hateful
Stelfax
,
he
lapsed
into
gloomy
silence
.
<EOS>
His
companions
were
equally
taciturn
and
moody
.
<EOS>
But
the
rest
of
the
company
took
no
umbrage
at
their
detention
,
appearing
rather
pleased
by
the
excuse
it
offered
them
for
making
a
night
of
it
.
<EOS>
Whether
Stelfax
sat
long
to
vex
Goldspur
and
his
sullen
comrades
—
or
whether
,
as
is
more
probable
,
he
felt
disposed
to
rest
and
enjoy
himself
after
a
hard
day
’s
work
—
<EOS>
certain
it
is
that
eleven
o’clock
had
struck
ere
<EOS>
he
rose
to
depart
.
<EOS>
The
reckoning
was
then
paid
—
rather
to
Simon
Piddinghoe
’s
surprise
,
for
the
soldiers
of
the
Republic
were
not
notorious
for
scrupulously
discharging
their
scores
;
the
horses
were
brought
out
;
the
prisoner
was
placed
on
the
crupper
behind
Nathan
Guestling
,
and
strapped
to
that
stout
trooper
as
he
had
previously
been
.
<EOS>
All
these
arrangements
made
,
Stelfax
mounted
,
and
after
partaking
of
a
stirrup
-
cup
proffered
by
the
host
,
put
himself
at
the
head
of
the
little
troop
,
and
rode
out
of
Poynings
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
Roundhead
leader
<EOS>
’s
injunctions
to
the
contrary
,
one
person
had
contrived
to
slip
out
of
the
house
unobserved
.
<EOS>
When
the
host
returned
to
his
guests
to
tell
them
they
were
now
free
to
depart
if
they
were
so
minded
,
he
remarked
that
Captain
Goldspur
was
gone
,
and
had
taken
his
rapier
with
him
.
<EOS>
Upon
which
he
muttered
,
“
There
will
be
mischief
,
I
fear
—
And
who
,
think
you
,
yon
red
-
coated
knaves
have
got
as
a
prisoner
,
my
worthy
masters
?
”
<EOS>
he
added
.
<EOS>
“Nay
<EOS>
,
I
know
not
,
”
the
schoolmaster
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
Who
should
it
be?”“No
other
than
Colonel
George
Gunter
of
Racton
,
”
the
host
replied
;
“
as
worthy
a
gentleman
as
any
in
the
county
,
and
as
staunch
a
partisan
as
ever
breathed
of
the
—
of
—
You
know
whom
I
mean
.
<EOS>
”“Was
that
Colonel
Gunter
of
Racton
?
”
<EOS>
cried
a
personage
in
a
tarnished
lace
cloak
and
dilapidated
Spanish
hat
.
<EOS>
“
Would
I
had
known
it
.
<EOS>
”“Why
,
what
wouldst
thou
have
done
,
Master
Jervoise
Rumboldsdyke
?
”
demanded
the
inquisitive
schoolmaster
.
<EOS>
“No
matter
,
”
the
other
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
It
may
not
yet
be
too
late
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
the
way
taken
by
those
cursed
troopers
,
”
he
added
to
the
host
.
<EOS>
“They
rode
towards
Patcham
,
”
Simon
Piddinghoe
replied
.
<EOS>
“
No
doubt
they
are
bound
for
Lewes
,
where
the
detachment
is
quartered
.
”“To
<EOS>
Lewes
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Rumboldsdyke
.
<EOS>
“
To
Lewes
,
then
,
let
us
hie
.
<EOS>
Here
is
thy
reckoning
,
mine
host
.
”
<EOS>
And
flinging
a
double
-
crown
upon
the
table
he
rushed
out
of
the
house
,
followed
by
his
comrades
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
clear
starlight
night
,
and
by
no
means
dark
.
<EOS>
Stelfax
kept
a
little
in
advance
of
his
men
,
but
did
not
urge
his
horse
beyond
a
walk
.
<EOS>
Their
road
lay
partly
along
a
valley
,
partly
over
a
lower
range
of
downs
.
<EOS>
After
a
while
,
they
reached
Patcham
,
and
were
passing
the
thick
hanging
wood
on
the
hill
-
side
,
when
a
pistol
—
for
such
the
fire
-
arm
seemed
to
be
from
its
report
—
was
discharged
at
Stelfax
.
<EOS>
The
bullet
struck
the
Roundhead
leader
’s
gorget
,
but
did
him
no
injury
.
<EOS>
He
instantly
turned
,
and
dashing
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
,
called
,
in
a
voice
of
thunder
,
upon
his
dastardly
assailant
to
show
himself
,
and
come
forth
if
he
dared
.
<EOS>
But
no
answer
was
returned
to
the
summons
,
neither
could
any
lurking
assassin
be
detected
.
<EOS>
Deeming
search
useless
at
such
an
hour
,
Stelfax
set
off
again
;
but
he
now
mended
his
pace
,
and
being
under
no
apprehension
of
losing
his
way
,
he
rode
over
the
silent
and
solitary
downs
in
the
direction
of
Ovingdean
,
where
he
arrived
without
further
molestation
of
any
kind
,
and
deposited
his
prisoner
at
the
Grange
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VIBy
<EOS>
What
Means
The
Prisoners
Escaped
From
The
ChurchWe
must
now
return
to
the
church
,
and
see
what
the
disorderly
rout
left
within
it
were
about
.
<EOS>
It
was
past
midnight
.
<EOS>
The
torches
were
still
blazing
,
but
the
thick
vapour
that
rose
from
their
flames
,
combined
with
the
tobacco
-
smoke
,
filled
the
whole
body
of
the
fabric
,
and
so
obscured
its
-
more
distant
portions
,
that
the
arched
screen
separating
the
chancel
from
the
nave
could
scarcely
be
discerned
.
<EOS>
The
light
,
struggling
through
this
vapour
,
only
imperfectly
revealed
the
figures
of
the
Ironsides
stretched
upon
the
benches
,
some
of
them
,
as
we
have
said
,
asleep
,
and
the
rest
in
a
drowsy
state
,
half
-
stupefied
with
drink
.
<EOS>
All
their
boisterous
merriment
had
long
since
ceased
,
and
nothing
was
heard
but
the
heavy
breathing
of
the
slumbering
topers
.
<EOS>
All
at
once
,
a
slight
noise
reached
the
ears
of
the
sergeant
,
and
looking
in
the
direction
<EOS>
whence
it
proceeded
<EOS>
,
he
thought
he
discerned
a
dark
figure
in
the
pulpit
.
<EOS>
After
steadily
regarding
the
object
for
a
few
moments
,
during
which
it
continued
perfectly
motionless
,
a
superstitious
terror
took
possession
of
Delves
,
and
be
began
to
think
it
was
the
Enemy
of
Mankind
standing
before
him
in
prison
.
<EOS>
Rousing
up
Besadaiah
Eavestaff
,
who
was
near
to
him
,
he
directed
his
attention
to
the
mysterious
figure
,
and
asked
him
,
in
accents
that
betrayed
his
alarm
,
what
he
thought
of
it?“It
is
the
Evil
One
,
”
Besadaiah
rejoined
,
rubbing
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
“
But
how
comes
he
here
,
in
yonder
pulpit
,
and
in
the
garb
of
a
minister
of
the
Church
?
<EOS>
I
am
not
afraid
—
I
will
address
him
.
<EOS>
”With
<EOS>
this
he
got
up
,
and
supporting
himself
with
his
carabine
,
staggered
towards
the
pulpit
.
<EOS>
“Aha
!
”
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
as
he
drew
near
,
“
I
have
it
now
,
sergeant
.
<EOS>
Whom
dost
thou
think
his
Satanic
Majesty
turns
out
to
be
?
<EOS>
No
other
than
Master
Increase
Micklegift
,
the
Independent
minister
,
whom
we
ejected
from
the
neighbouring
mansion
by
our
captain
’s
commands
.
<EOS>
How
comes
he
here
?
<EOS>
Doth
he
take
up
his
abode
altogether
within
this
church?”“If
it
be
indeed
Master
Micklegift
,
and
not
an
evil
spirit
in
his
form
,
”
Delves
rejoined
,
”
question
him
thyself
.
<EOS>
”“He
<EOS>
shall
not
need
to
do
so
,
”
cried
Micklegift
,
<EOS>
for
it
was
he
.
<EOS>
“
I
have
placed
myself
here
to
see
how
you
who
profess
to
be
soldiers
fighting
for
the
cause
of
religion
and
truth
would
comport
yourselves
,
and
I
find
that
ye
are
as
riotous
and
intemperate
as
the
scoffers
,
brawlers
,
and
tipplers
whom
ye
profess
to
reprobate
.
<EOS>
Are
ye
not
ashamed
to
be
wallowing
in
drunkenness
when
ye
should
watch
and
pray
?
<EOS>
Call
ye
<EOS>
yourselves
good
soldiers
of
the
Republic
?
<EOS>
You
are
said
to
be
the
favoured
host
of
our
great
Joshua
,
Cromwell
;
but
is
it
by
conduct
like
this
that
you
have
earned
his
regard
?
<EOS>
Hardly
so
,
methinks
!
<EOS>
If
you
must
needs
turn
this
tabernacle
into
a
place
of
duresse
for
your
prisoners
,
why
should
you
thus
defile
it
?
<EOS>
For
your
profaneness
and
irreverence
ye
ought
to
be
driven
forth
with
stripes
,
and
if
a
judgment
should
fall
upon
your
heads
ye
will
have
richly
merited
it
.
”“Peace
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Besadaiah
;
“
I
will
hear
no
more
from
thee
.
<EOS>
”“Nay
,
there
is
reason
in
what
the
good
man
saith
,
”
cried
.
<EOS>
Delves
.
<EOS>
“
We
deserve
his
rebukes
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
owned
that
our
conduct
this
night
hath
not
been
in
accordance
either
with
our
principles
or
our
duty
.
<EOS>
”“Our
captain
mislikes
this
man
,
and
suspects
him
of
being
in
league
with
the
malignants
,
”
cried
Besadaiah
.
<EOS>
“
By
his
own
showing
he
hath
been
playing
the
spy
upon
us
.
<EOS>
Let
him
come
down
from
that
pulpit
,
and
free
us
at
once
from
his
presence
,
or
I
will
send
a
bullet
through
his
brain
.
<EOS>
”“Thou
darest
not
lift
thy
hand
against
me
,
thou
sacrilegious
ruffian
,
”
thundered
Micklegift
.
<EOS>
“
My
purpose
is
to
hold
forth
unto
thee
and
to
thy
comrades
,
and
to
strive
to
awaken
ye
all
to
a
sense
of
your
sinfulness
.
”“It
<EOS>
will
be
labour
thrown
away
,
worthy
sir
,
”
said
Delves
,
“
<EOS>
so
I
pray
you
forbear
.
<EOS>
With
what
intent
you
have
come
hither
,
and
hidden
yourself
away
until
this
moment
,
is
best
known
to
your
secret
heart
.
<EOS>
But
such
conduct
is
questionable
,
and
seems
to
justify
our
captain
’s
doubts
as
to
your
sincerity
to
the
cause
.
<EOS>
I
have
prisoners
in
charge
here
,
as
you
are
aware
-
prisoners
for
whose
security
I
am
responsible
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
but
you
may
have
some
design
to
give
them
aid
,
and
must
therefore
enjoin
you
to
quit
the
church
without
delay
.
<EOS>
”“What
if
I
refuse
to
go
?
”
rejoined
Micklegift
.
<EOS>
“
What
if
,
in
my
turn
,
I
command
thee
and
thy
sacrilegious
crew
to
depart
from
the
tabernacle
which
ye
have
profaned
?
“
“
You
will
do
well
not
to
provoke
me
further
,
”
Besadaiah
cried
,
in
a
menacing
voice
,
and
levelling
his
musket
at
the
Independent
minister
as
he
spoke
.
<EOS>
“
Come
down
,
I
say
,
at
once
,
and
quit
the
church
—
or
that
pulpit
shall
be
thy
coffin
.
<EOS>
”“Put
down
thy
weapon
,
Besadaiah
,
and
harm
not
the
man
,
”
interposed
Delves
.
<EOS>
“
Though
his
conduct
be
suspicious
,
he
may
have
no
ill
intent
.
<EOS>
Hearken
unto
me
,
Master
Micklegift
,
and
compel
me
not
to
have
recourse
to
harsh
measures
with
thee
.
<EOS>
Thou
canst
not
stay
here
.
<EOS>
”“The
church
is
mine
,
and
nothing
but
force
shall
make
me
quit
it
,
”
cried
Micklegift
,
vehemently
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
grieve
to
hear
you
say
so
<EOS>
,
”
the
sergeant
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
I
desire
not
to
use
violence
,
but
your
obstinacy
will
leave
me
no
other
alternative
.
”“Better
<EOS>
let
me
put
an
end
to
the
discussion
,
sergeant
,
”
growled
Besadaiah
,
again
raising
his
carabine
.
<EOS>
“Not
<EOS>
in
that
way
,
I
tell
thee
,
”
Delves
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
For
the
last
time
,
I
say
unto
thee
,
Master
Micklegift
,
wilt
thou
depart
peaceably
,
or
must
I
put
thee
forth?”“I
<EOS>
will
not
leave
mine
own
church
at
thine
,
or
at
any
man
’s
bidding
,
”
the
Independent
minister
rejoined
;
“
and
I
counsel
thee
not
to
attempt
to
use
force
against
me
,
or
thou
wilt
rue
it
.
<EOS>
Lay
but
a
finger
upon
me
,
and
<EOS>
I
will
render
thine
arm
powerless
.
<EOS>
”“Tut
!
<EOS>
tut
!
<EOS>
this
is
idle
vaunting
!
”
<EOS>
the
sergeant
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
“
Since
thou
wilt
not
be
advised
,
thou
must
take
the
consequences
.
<EOS>
”“No
<EOS>
;
it
is
thou
who
must
take
the
consequences
,
sergeant
.
<EOS>
I
have
warned
thee
,
”
Micklegift
rejoined
,
raising
his
hands
.
<EOS>
“Aid
<EOS>
me
to
put
him
forth
,
Besadaiah
,
”
said
Delves
,
“
for
I
perceive
he
is
disposed
to
offer
resistance
.
<EOS>
But
take
heed
thou
doest
him
no
injury
.
”Rearing
<EOS>
his
carabine
against
the
door
of
a
pew
<EOS>
,
he
marched
towards
the
pulpit
.
<EOS>
Besadaiah
also
laid
down
his
musket
,
and
followed
him
.
<EOS>
But
scarcely
had
the
foremost
of
the
two
Ironsides
set
foot
on
the
pulpit
-
steps
,
when
Micklegift
clapped
his
hands
together
,
and
called
out
with
a
loud
voice
,
“
Arise!—it
is
time!”At
the
signal
,
for
such
it
proved
,
two
persons
suddenly
sprang
up
behind
the
troopers
,
and
in
an
instant
possessed
themselves
of
the
carabines
which
had
been
so
imprudently
abandoned
.
<EOS>
These
personages
,
it
soon
appeared
,
were
no
other
than
the
Saxbys
,
father
and
son
,
who
had
contrived
to
secrete
themselves
until
this
moment
within
the
chancel
.
<EOS>
Levelling
the
gun
at
the
Roundhead
soldiers
,
Ninian
and
his
father
threatened
to
shoot
them
if
they
stirred
a
step
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
Micklegift
’s
turn
to
triumph
.
<EOS>
Not
only
had
his
signal
summoned
the
Saxbys
from
their
hiding
-
place
,
but
at
the
same
moment
the
prisoners
burst
forth
from
the
interior
of
the
tower
,
and
so
unexpectedly
,
that
ere
<EOS>
the
drunken
and
drowsy
troopers
could
recover
from
their
surprise
and
seize
their
arms
,
they
were
deprived
of
them
by
their
assailants
.
<EOS>
Aided
by
circumstances
,
the
stratagem
completely
succeeded
.
<EOS>
All
the
’
fire
-
arms
were
secured
by
the
Royalists
.
<EOS>
Helpless
Henly
was
so
overcome
by
the
liquor
he
had
swallowed
,
that
he
could
not
raise
himself
from
the
ground
;
and
two
others
were
in
nearly
the
like
state
.
<EOS>
The
Royalists
now
numbered
five
,
but
as
they
had
obtained
possession
of
all
the
muskets
and
pistols
belonging
to
the
troop
,
it
followed
that
they
were
completely
masters
of
the
position
.
<EOS>
Without
much
difficulty
,
the
newly
liberated
prisoners
succeeded
in
driving
such
of
the
Ironsides
as
were
capable
of
offering
resistance
into
the
tower
which
they
themselves
had
so
recently
occupied
,
and
locked
the
door
upon
them
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
they
turned
their
attention
to
Delves
and
Besadaiah
,
over
whom
the
two
Saxbys
still
kept
guard
,
with
levelled
muskets
.
<EOS>
On
coming
up
,
John
Habergeon
at
once
rushed
in
and
grappled
with
the
sergeant
,
while
Ninian
and
his
father
laid
hold
of
Besadaiah
.
<EOS>
A
coil
of
rope
which
had
been
brought
in
by
the
troopers
was
soon
found
by
Micklegift
,
who
by
this
time
had
descended
from
the
pulpit
,
and
with
it
Delves
and
his
comrade
were
bound
hand
and
foot
,
and
handkerchiefs
tied
over
their
mouths
.
<EOS>
Though
the
trouble
seemed
needless
,
similar
precautions
were
taken
with
Helpless
Henly
and
the
two
other
equally
inert
troopers
;
and
only
one
of
them
stirred
and
opened
his
eyes
while
the
cords
were
being
fastened
round
his
wrists
.
<EOS>
The
Royalists
next
transformed
themselves
into
the
semblance
of
Republican
soldiers
,
by
putting
on
the
habiliments
and
accoutrements
of
their
enemies
,
equipping
themselves
in
the
scarlet
doublets
,
tassets
,
breastplates
,
headpieces
,
and
bandoleers
of
the
Ironsides
,
buckling
on
their
swords
,
and
appropriating
their
carabines
and
pistols
.
<EOS>
These
operations
were
conducted
as
expeditiously
as
possible
,
for
the
troopers
shut
up
within
the
tower
had
begun
to
vociferate
loudly
,
and
make
as
much
noise
as
they
could
,
in
the
hope
of
giving
the
alarm
;
and
though
the
thick
walls
of
the
chamber
in
which
they
were
enclosed
greatly
deadened
the
clamour
,
still
the
Royalists
did
not
know
whether
it
might
not
be
heard
at
the
Grange
.
<EOS>
So
the
utmost
dispatch
was
used
.
<EOS>
And
no
sooner
was
their
task
accomplished
,
than
the
newly
released
prisoners
,
with
their
deliverers
,
Micklegift
and
the
two
Saxbys
,
quitted
the
church
,
locking
the
door
upon
their
foes
.
<EOS>
On
issuing
from
the
church
,
Micklegift
quitted
the
party
,
and
hastened
to
the
parsonage
,
to
make
preparations
for
instant
flight
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
Ovingdean
would
be
no
safe
place
for
him
.
<EOS>
The
Royalists
agreed
to
keep
together
for
the
present
,
unless
circumstances
should
require
them
to
separate
.
<EOS>
Command
of
the
little
party
naturally
devolved
upon
Lord
Wilmot
,
and
his
first
instructions
were
to
proceed
to
the
stables
,
and
help
themselves
to
the
troopers
’
horses
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
moon
had
risen
,
but
her
lustre
was
frequently
obscured
by
passing
clouds
.
<EOS>
Not
being
familiar
with
the
locality
,
Lord
Wilmot
placed
himself
under
the
guidance
of
Ninian
Saxby
,
who
now
led
the
way
to
the
stables
.
<EOS>
As
the
young
falconer
marched
along
in
this
unaccustomed
guise
of
steel
cap
and
breastplate
,
he
almost
lost
the
sense
of
his
own
identity
,
and
while
eyeing
his
accoutrements
with
secret
satisfaction
,
flattered
himself
that
he
made
a
very
smart
soldier
,
and
only
regretted
that
Patty
Whinchat
could
not
behold
him
.
<EOS>
The
party
were
crossing
the
valley
a
little
to
the
south
of
the
Grange
,
when
the
sound
of
their
footsteps
attracted
the
attention
of
the
patrol
at
the
door
of
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
The
sentinel
immediately
advanced
to
the
gate
,
and
challenged
them
.
<EOS>
“Who
are
ye
that
go
there
?
”
<EOS>
he
demanded
.
<EOS>
“Friends
!
”
responded
John
Habergeon
,
in
the
true
puritanical
snuffle
.
<EOS>
“Advance
,
friends
,
and
give
the
countersign
,
”
rejoined
the
sentinel
.
<EOS>
“Maccabaeus
and
his
company
,
”
John
replied
,
having
luckily
overheard
the
watchword
whispered
by
the
sergeant
to
his
men
.
<EOS>
“Pass
<EOS>
on
,
then
,
”
cried
the
trooper
.
”
<EOS>
Yet
stay!-whither
go
ye?”“To
the
stables
,
by
order
of
Sergeant
Delves
.
<EOS>
”“Good!—but
<EOS>
what
means
the
clamour
within
the
church?”“It
is
caused
by
the
malignant
prisoners
,
who
like
not
their
lodging
,
”
John
replied
,
with
a
laugh
,
which
was
echoed
by
the
trooper,“Is
that
all
?
”
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
“
I
feared
something
might
have
gone
wrong
.
<EOS>
”“Hath
<EOS>
aught
been
heard
of
our
captain
?
<EOS>
demanded
Lord
Wilmot
,
disguising
his
voice
as
well
as
he
was
able
.
<EOS>
“He
<EOS>
returned
half
an
hour
ago
with
the
prisoner
,
”
replied
the
sentinel
.
<EOS>
“Did
<EOS>
you
hear
that
?
<EOS>
“
Lord
Wilmot
observed
in
a
low
voice
to
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“
Colonel
Gunter
is
taken
.
<EOS>
He
must
be
rescued
at
any
cost
.
<EOS>
”“Do
<EOS>
you
go
back
to
the
church
after
seeing
to
the
horses
,
or
are
some
of
us
to
take
your
place
?
”
<EOS>
inquired
the
sentinel
.
<EOS>
“We
will
return
presently
and
ascertain
the
captain
’s
pleasure
,
”
returned
Lord
Wilmot
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
the
Royalists
moved
on
,
and
the
sentinel
went
back
to
his
post
.
<EOS>
In
another
minute
the
party
reached
the
stables
.
<EOS>
Opening
the
door
,
Ninian
quickly
roused
up
a
couple
of
grooms
who
were
lying
asleep
on
a
pile
of
straw
.
<EOS>
A
lighted
horn
lantern
was
hanging
by
a
pulley
overhead
.
<EOS>
At
first
the
grooms
took
the
whole
party
for
Republican
soldiers
,
and
seemed
reluctant
to
get
up
,
but
when
Ninian
made
himself
known
,
they
quickly
bestirred
themselves
.
<EOS>
Each
stall
had
a
couple
of
horses
within
it
;
but
though
the
stables
were
large
,
there
was
not
accommodation
for
so
many
,
and
several
of
the
troopers
’
steeds
had
been
placed
in
the
cow
-
house
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
the
latter
place
that
Lord
Wilmot
found
his
own
charger
.
<EOS>
Having
selected
such
horses
as
they
thought
would
best
suit
them
—
keeping
one
for
Colonel
Gunter
,
in
case
they
should
succeed
in
liberating
him
—
they
turned
all
the
others
loose
in
the
farm
-
yard
,
hiding
away
the
saddles
and
bridles
.
<EOS>
But
just
as
the
party
issued
forth
from
the
stables
with
their
newly
acquired
steeds
,
an
alarming
sound
reached
their
ears
.
<EOS>
The
bell
of
the
church
began
to
toll
.
<EOS>
How
it
could
be
rung
by
the
imprisoned
Ironsides
,
the
Royalists
could
not
conjecture
,
for
they
had
seen
no
bell
-
rope
;
but
so
it
was
.
<EOS>
The
bell
went
on
tolling
,
and
with
momentarily
increasing
rapidity
and
loudness
.
<EOS>
At
this
sound
,
the
sentinel
posted
outside
the
Grange
gave
the
alarm
.
<EOS>
In
another
minute
the
door
of
the
mansion
was
thrown
open
,
and
,
a
light
streaming
forth
,
showed
the
soldiers
rushing
out
.
<EOS>
Though
somewhat
taken
by
surprise
,
Lord
Wilmot
and
his
party
promptly
prepared
to
act

CAPTAIN
TATTERSALL
OF
THE
SWIFTSURECHAPTER
<EOS>
IHow
Sargeant
Delves
Was
Reprimanded
By
His
LeaderWEARIED
by
his
long
ride
,
and
by
his
exertions
throughout
the
day
,
Stelfax
,
on
his
return
to
Ovingdean
Grange
with
the
prisoner
,
retired
to
the
chamber
he
had
appropriated
,
and
merely
taking
off
the
more
cumbrous
parts
of
his
accoutrements
,
flung
himself
on
the
couch
.
<EOS>
He
was
buried
in
profound
slumber
,
when
the
knocking
of
the
butt
-
end
of
a
carabine
at
the
door
roused
him
,
causing
him
to
spring
up
instantly
and
seize
his
arms
.
<EOS>
Clapping
his
steel
cap
on
his
head
,
but
without
tarrying
to
buckle
on
his
corslet
and
leg
-
pieces
,
he
marched
to
the
door
,
and
,
unfastening
it
,
found
Mattathias
outside
,
who
acquainted
him
with
the
strange
ringing
of
the
church
bell
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
sound
could
be
plainly
distinguished
where
they
were
,
though
the
room
was
at
the
back
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Stelfax
was
not
so
much
alarmed
as
his
subordinate
,
for
it
did
not
occur
to
him
as
possible
that
Delves
could
be
the
dupe
of
a
stratagem
.
<EOS>
Something
,
however
,
was
wrong
,
and
must
be
promptly
rectified
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
hurried
downstairs
,
with
the
intention
of
repairing
to
the
church
,
but
,
on
gaining
the
entrance
-
hall
,
found
it
invaded
by
a
tumultuous
assemblage
of
the
household
,
who
had
flocked
thither
on
hearing
the
bell
toll
,
and
two
or
three
minutes
were
spent
in
their
dispersion
.
<EOS>
But
this
being
accomplished
,
he
left
a
small
guard
in
the
hall
,
as
well
to
watch
over
the
prisoner
,
who
was
confined
in
a
little
room
adjacent
to
the
library
,
as
to
keep
the
household
in
order
,
and
then
went
forth
with
the
rest
of
his
troop
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
a
trumpet
had
more
than
once
been
sounded
outside
to
recall
the
men
supposed
to
be
gone
to
the
stables
;
but
no
notice
was
taken
of
the
summons
.
<EOS>
When
informed
of
this
circumstance
,
Stelfax
was
exceedingly
wroth
,
and
dispatched
Nathan
Guestling
to
the
stables
,
commanding
the
instant
return
of
the
offenders
.
<EOS>
A
further
interruption
to
his
progress
occurred
at
the
gate
.
<EOS>
A
posse
of
villagers
,
only
partially
attired
,
and
armed
with
such
weapons
as
came
readiest
to
hand
,
was
here
congregated
,
anxious
to
learn
the
cause
of
the
disturbance
.
<EOS>
Distrusting
these
hinds
,
Stelfax
peremptorily
ordered
them
to
return
to
their
dwellings
,
threatening
to
fire
upon
them
if
they
hesitated
to
comply
.
<EOS>
Intimidated
by
the
menace
,
the
poor
fellows
retired
,
while
the
Ironside
captain
and
his
men
pursued
their
way
to
the
church
.
<EOS>
The
torches
having
been
left
burning
by
the
fugitive
Royalists
when
they
quitted
their
temporary
prison
,
the
light
of
the
flambeaux
was
dimly
distinguishable
through
the
windows
as
Stelfax
passed
through
the
churchyard
;
but
<EOS>
nothing
,
as
yet
,
had
occurred
to
rouse
his
suspicions
.
<EOS>
His
surprise
and
rage
,
however
,
may
be
conceived
when
his
thundering
knock
at
the
church
door
,
which
he
found
looked
,
remained
unanswered
.
<EOS>
Violently
shaking
the
door
,
he
endeavoured
by
main
strength
to
burst
it
open
,
and
,
aided
by
his
men
,
he
speedily
accomplished
his
object
.
<EOS>
A
scene
then
lay
before
him
so
startling
and
extraordinary
,
that
he
could
scarcely
believe
in
its
reality
.
<EOS>
His
astonishment
and
stupefaction
,
however
,
soon
gave
way
to
fury
.
<EOS>
Snatching
a
torch
,
he
threw
its
light
upon
the
prostrate
forms
of
Delves
and
Besadaiah
,
and
then
commanded
that
the
handkerchiefs
should
be
taken
from
their
mouths
,
but
that
the
cords
with
which
they
were
bound
should
not
be
unloosed
.
<EOS>
“How
is
this
,
sergeant
?
”
<EOS>
he
demanded
in
a
severe
voice
,
as
the
order
was
obeyed
.
<EOS>
“
How
comes
it
that
I
find
thee
thus?”Delves
gave
utterance
to
a
groan
,
but
made
no
other
reply
.
<EOS>
“How
<EOS>
hast
thou
fulfilled
thine
office
?
”
<EOS>
continued
Stelfax
,
with
increased
severity
.
<EOS>
“
Where
are
the
captives
committed
to
thy
charge?”“Gone
,
captain
—
all
gone
!
”
<EOS>
groaned
Delves
,
in
a
tone
of
deep
contrition
.
<EOS>
“
They
have
escaped
from
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
attempt
to
extenuate
my
conduct
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
guilty
of
gross
neglect
.
<EOS>
”“Soh
!
<EOS>
thou
dost
confess
it!—ha
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Stelfax
,
with
concentrated
fury
.
<EOS>
“
Negligent
and
disobedient
dog
,
thou
deservest
that
I
should
pistol
thee
without
grace
allowed
for
prayer
.
”“Dispatch
<EOS>
me
,
captain
,
without
pity
,
”
the
sergeant
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
I
deserve
to
die
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
be
more
angered
with
me
than
I
am
with
myself
.
<EOS>
Were
I
to
live
a
hundred
years
,
instead
of
only
so
many
seconds
,
I
should
never
regain
my
own
good
opinion
.
<EOS>
To
think
that
I
,
who
have
been
signalled
out
for
public
commendation
by
the
Lord
General
himself
—
who
have
been
deemed
worthy
of
your
confidence
,
captain
—
who
prided
myself
upon
strictness
of
discipline
,
and
blind
obedience
to
the
orders
of
my
superior
,
that
I
should
have
failed
on
all
points!—it
is
too
much
—
it
is
more
than
I
can
bear
.
<EOS>
Place
your
pistol
at
my
head
,
and
finish
me
.
<EOS>
”“No
<EOS>
,
”
rejoined
Stelfax
;
“
I
will
not
forestal
the
provost
-
marshal
’s
office
.
<EOS>
Grievously
am
I
disappointed
in
thee
,
O
Deodatus
Delves!—shamefully
hast
thou
betrayed
thy
trust
!
<EOS>
But
how
came
the
matter
to
pass
?
<EOS>
It
passeth
my
comprehension
to
understand
how
thou
and
thy
comrades
could
be
overcome
and
bound
by
so
few
.
<EOS>
Ye
would
almost
seem
to
have
proffered
your
limbs
to
the
fetters
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
”“Our
prisoners
had
a
subtle
demon
to
aid
them
,
captain
,
”
replied
Delves
.
<EOS>
“
Strong
waters
were
treacherously
introduced
with
the
provisions
from
the
house
,
and
robbed
the
men
of
their
senses
,
so
that
they
were
no
longer
under
my
control
.
<EOS>
I
say
not
this
in
my
own
defence
,
but
in
explanation
.
<EOS>
The
truth
will
appear
upon
inquiry
,
if
I
be
brought
before
a
court
-
martial
.
<EOS>
”“Why
didst
thou
not
snatch
the
mischievous
drink
from
the
besotted
fools
?
”
<EOS>
demanded
Stelfax
.
<EOS>
“Alack
,
captain
,
all
my
efforts
were
unavailing
.
<EOS>
They
resisted
,
and
would
not
be
bidden
.
<EOS>
But
this
was
only
part
of
a
scheme
,
which
I
believe
to
have
been
devised
by
the
Independent
minister
,
Increase
Micklegift
.
<EOS>
Men
were
hidden
within
the
church
,
who
came
forth
suddenly
to
aid
in
liberating
the
captives
.
<EOS>
”“All
<EOS>
this
shows
how
culpably
negligent
hath
been
thy
conduct
,
”
said
Stelfax
.
<EOS>
“
A
notable
example
will
be
made
of
thee
.
”“Reproach
<EOS>
me
no
more
,
captain
,
”
cried
Delves
.
<EOS>
“
Your
words
are
not
needed
to
sharpen
the
stings
of
my
own
conscience
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
if
I
be
not
discarded
from
the
service
,
no
departure
from
duty
shall
ever
again
be
laid
to
my
charge
.
”“Misconduct
<EOS>
like
thine
can
not
be
lightly
passed
over
,
I
tell
thee
,
”
returned
Stelfax
,
somewhat
appeased
,
though
not
choosing
to
let
it
appear
that
he
was
so
.
<EOS>
“
Thou
hast
suffered
a
prisoner
of
great
importance
to
escape
from
thee
.
<EOS>
Thou
wert
made
responsible
—
body
for
body
—
for
the
security
of
the
Lord
Wilmot
,
who
was
committed
to
thy
charge
.
<EOS>
How
wilt
thou
answer
for
his
evasion?”“Even
as
you
yourself
have
said
,
captain
,
with
mine
own
body
,
”
the
sergeant
returned
.
<EOS>
“Go
to
!
<EOS>
dolt
.
<EOS>
Think’st
thou
thy
worthless
carcase
,
or
those
of
all
thy
mutinous
comrades
,
will
weigh
with
the
Lord
General
against
the
head
of
this
malignant
nobleman
?
<EOS>
A
great
prize
has
been
lost
through
thy
negligence
.
<EOS>
I
have
hunted
down
Lord
Wilmot
’s
companion
,
and
brought
him
back
captive
,
and
thou
mayst
guess
how
it
would
have
gladdened
our
general
to
receive
the
twain
from
my
hands
.
<EOS>
Thou
thyself
wouldst
have
been
advanced
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
I
make
little
account
of
young
Maunsel
and
the
others
,
but
the
Lord
Wilmot
is
a
great
loss
.
<EOS>
”“But
<EOS>
may
he
not
be
recaptured
?
”
said
Delves
.
<EOS>
“
Release
me
from
these
bonds
,
and
I
will
not
rest
till
I
bring
him
back
to
you
,
dead
or
alive
.
<EOS>
Fear
nothing
!
<EOS>
I
have
no
desire
to
escape
punishment
,
but
am
wishful
to
repair
the
mischief
I
have
done
.
”“Be
<EOS>
it
<EOS>
so
,
then
,
”
said
Stelfax
,
after
a
moment
’s
reflection
.
<EOS>
“
I
will
give
thee
a
chance
of
redeeming
thy
errors
.
<EOS>
Untie
those
cords
,
and
set
him
free
,
”
he
added
,
to
the
men
near
him
.
<EOS>
The
order
was
instantly
obeyed
,
and
the
like
grace
was
accorded
to
Besadaiah
,
who
humbled
himself
,
as
the
sergeant
had
done
,
promising
better
conduct
in
future
.
<EOS>
Long
before
this
,
the
troopers
shut
up
in
the
tower
had
been
let
out
,
but
they
kept
aloof
,
as
long
as
they
could
,
from
their
incensed
leader
.
<EOS>
How
the
church
bell
had
been
rung
was
then
explained
.
<EOS>
One
of
their
number
,
aided
by
his
comrades
,
who
lifted
him
on
their
shoulders
,
after
the
manner
practised
by
professional
tumblers
,
had
contrived
to
catch
hold
of
the
bell
-
rope
,
which
had
been
tied
up
at
a
point
supposed
to
be
out
of
reach
.
<EOS>
The
bell
was
then
tolled
without
difficulty
.
<EOS>
The
Ironside
leader
’s
anger
being
by
this
time
considerably
abated
,
he
contented
himself
with
sharply
reprimanding
all
the
minor
culprits
.
<EOS>
But
the
state
in
which
Helpless
Henly
and
the
two
other
drunken
troopers
were
found
did
not
admit
of
their
conduct
being
passed
over
so
lightly
.
<EOS>
Causing
the
bandages
to
be
removed
from
their
mouths
,
but
not
suffering
the
cords
with
which
they
were
bound
to
be
taken
off
,
their
leader
left
them
in
this
state
to
sleep
off
the
effects
of
their
drunken
revel
.
<EOS>
While
mustering
the
men
,
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
to
inquire
from
Delves
whom
he
had
sent
to
the
stables
.
<EOS>
“I
have
sent
no
one
,
”
the
sergeant
replied
.
<EOS>
“
If
any
have
gone
thither
,
it
must
be
the
cunning
malignants
who
carried
off
our
weapons
and
accoutrements
.
<EOS>
”“Thou
art
right
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Stelfax
.
<EOS>
“
Fool
that
I
was
,
not
to
perceive
this
sooner
!
<EOS>
These
men
were
seen
and
challenged
by
the
sentinel
,
who
took
them
for
comrades
because
they
were
accoutred
like
us
,
and
gave
the
watchword
.
<EOS>
Let
us
to
the
stables
at
once
—
though
I
fear
the
birds
are
flown
.
<EOS>
In
that
case
we
must
scour
the
country
for
them
.
<EOS>
”Upon
<EOS>
which
he
rushed
out
of
the
church
,
followed
by
his
men
.
<EOS>
IllustrationCHAPTER
IIIn
What
Manner
Colonel
Gunter
Was
LiberatedNo
notice
,
as
we
have
shown
,
was
taken
by
Lord
Wilmot
and
the
little
party
under
his
command
of
the
trumpeter
’s
summons
;
but
as
it
was
almost
certain
that
a
messenger
would
speedily
be
sent
to
order
their
return
,
preparations
were
made
for
his
reception
.
<EOS>
For
this
purpose
,
John
Habergeon
and
the
elder
Saxby
dismounted
and
entered
the
stable
;
and
as
soon
as
Nathan
Guestling
arrived
there
,
the
door
was
closed
upon
him
,
and
,
being
seized
by
these
two
powerful
men
,
he
was
thrown
down
bound
hand
and
foot
with
a
halter
,
and
almost
stifled
with
a
horse
-
cloth
wrapped
round
his
face
.
<EOS>
This
task
accomplished
,
the
pair
issued
from
the
stables
,
and
found
that
,
in
the
interim
,
Lord
Wilmot
had
sent
the
horses
,
in
charge
of
the
grooms
,
to
a
particular
spot
at
the
back
of
the
garden
indicated
by
Ninian
.
<EOS>
Stelfax
had
been
sent
to
go
to
the
church
with
a
party
of
men
,
and
the
house
being
left
comparatively
undefended
,
his
lordship
apprehended
little
resistance
,
and
ordered
his
party
to
set
forward
at
once
.
<EOS>
As
they
approached
the
mansion
,
the
sentinel
called
out
to
them
,
“
How
now
,
comrades
!
<EOS>
Are
ye
come
at
last
?
<EOS>
Wherefore
did
ye
not
answer
the
recall
?
<EOS>
Did
ye
not
hear
the
alarm
-
bell
rung
from
the
church?”“Question
us
not
—
we
are
in
haste
,
”
Lord
Wilmot
hastily
replied
,
pressing
on
with
the
others
.
<EOS>
“
Come
with
me
inside
,
and
thou
shalt
hear
that
which
will
surprise
thee
.
<EOS>
”“What
<EOS>
hath
happened
?
”
<EOS>
demanded
the
man
,
preceding
them
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
But
scarcely
had
he
crossed
the
threshold
than
the
Royalists
closed
round
him
and
disarmed
him
.
<EOS>
“Utter
but
a
cry
,
”
said
Lord
Wilmot
,
clapping
a
pistol
close
to
his
head
,
“
and
it
will
be
thy
last
.
<EOS>
Thou
art
wholly
in
our
power
.
<EOS>
But
do
as
I
bid
thee
,
and
thy
life
shall
be
spared
.
<EOS>
Dost
heed
me
,
knave?”The
man
made
no
reply
,
but
did
not
attempt
to
give
the
alarm
.
<EOS>
At
the
moment
when
the
Royalists
thus
gained
admittance
to
the
hall
it
was
empty
.
<EOS>
On
a
table
at
one
side
a
lamp
was
burning
,
but
Ninian
quickly
extinguished
it
,
and
plunged
the
place
in
darkness
.
<EOS>
Just
as
this
was
accomplished
,
the
door
of
a
room
adjoining
the
library
was
opened
,
and
a
harsh
voice
demanded
who
was
there
.
<EOS>
“Do
<EOS>
thou
answer
,
”
said
Lord
Wilmot
to
the
sentinel
,
still
holding
the
mouth
of
the
pistol
to
his
head
.
<EOS>
“‘Tis
<EOS>
I
—
Gabriel
Flint
,
”
responded
the
sentinel
.
<EOS>
“Ha
!
<EOS>
what
dost
thou
there
,
Gabriel
?
”
inquired
the
other
.
<EOS>
“Speak
as
I
enjoin
thee
,
”
muttered
Lord
Wilmot
,
breathing
a
few
words
in
his
ear
.
<EOS>
“The
<EOS>
captain
hath
sent
a
file
of
men
for
the
prisoner
,
”
said
Flint
.
<EOS>
“Ay
,
bring
him
forth
without
delay
,
”
added
John
Habergeon
,
in
a
snuffling
,
puritanical
voice
.
<EOS>
“
We
are
to
take
him
to
his
friends
at
the
church
.
<EOS>
”“Ye
<EOS>
shall
have
him
,
and
welcome
,
”
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
“
But
tell
me
,
comrade
,
what
was
the
meaning
of
that
ringing
of
the
church
bell?”“‘Twas
a
mere
trick
of
the
prisoners
,
”
responded
John
;
“
they
had
barricaded
the
door
of
the
tower
wherein
they
were
confined
,
and
I
suppose
contrived
to
clamber
up
the
walls
and
reach
the
bell
-
rope
.
<EOS>
The
noise
is
checked
now
.
<EOS>
”“Ay
,
our
captain
would
soon
put
a
stop
to
such
vagaries
,
I
’ll
warrant
him
,
”
responded
the
trooper
.
<EOS>
“
Come
forth
,
prisoner
,
”
he
added
.
<EOS>
“Whither
would
ye
take
me
?
”
demanded
Colonel
Gunter
,
as
he
approached
the
door
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
“To
<EOS>
your
friends
,
”
replied
the
trooper
,
in
a
jeering
tone
.
<EOS>
“
They
are
anxious
for
your
company
.
<EOS>
”“They
are
,
”
<EOS>
Lord
Wilmot
answered
,
“
Be
quick!”Colonel
Gunter
fancied
he
recognized
the
voice
,
and
accelerated
his
movements
.
<EOS>
“Here
is
the
prisoner
,
”
said
the
trooper
,
pushing
the
colonel
forth—“take
him
!
<EOS>
But
the
lamp
has
gone
out
,
I
perceive
.
<EOS>
I
will
bring
a
light
instantly
.
”“It
<EOS>
is
needless
,
”
John
Habergeon
replied
.
<EOS>
“
We
care
not
to
behold
the
Amalekite
’s
features
.
<EOS>
We
will
take
thy
word
that
it
is
the
right
man
.
”While
<EOS>
this
brief
colloquy
occurred
,
Lord
Wilmot
grasped
the
colonel
’s
arm
,
and
made
his
presence
known
to
him
in
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
“You
here
,
my
good
lord
,
and
in
that
garb
?
<EOS>
”
exclaimed
Colonel
Gunter
,
in
a
low
tone
.
<EOS>
“Hush
!
”
cried
Lord
Wilmot
.
<EOS>
“
We
are
all
friends
—
except
this
rascal
,
whose
brains
I
will
blow
out
if
he
venture
to
utter
a
word
.
<EOS>
Mve
on
with
the
prisoner!—to
the
church
!
”
<EOS>
he
added
,
aloud
.
<EOS>
“Not
<EOS>
so
fast
,
comrades!—not
so
fast
!
<EOS>
A
word
with
you
ere
you
depart
!
”
<EOS>
cried
the
trooper
,
appearing
at
the
door
with
a
light
.
<EOS>
All
chance
of
concealment
was
then
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
“Ha
!
<EOS>
what
is
this
?
”
<EOS>
cried
the
trooper
.
<EOS>
“
Malignants
in
the
garb
of
soldiers
of
the
Republic
.
<EOS>
Where
are
ye
,
comrades
?
<EOS>
Treason!—help!—succour!”As
he
spoke
,
he
discharged
his
pistol
at
the
retreating
Royalists
.
<EOS>
The
ball
passed
within
an
inch
of
Lord
Wilmot
’s
head
,
but
fortunately
missed
him
.
<EOS>
John
Habergeon
and
Ninian
Saxby
fired
at
the
trooper
in
return
,
but
as
the
latter
had
instantly
retreated
into
the
room
,
no
damage
was
done
him
.
<EOS>
Prohibiting
any
continuance
of
the
conflict
,
Lord
Wilmot
ordered
his
party
to
move
on
.
<EOS>
He
still
kept
hold
of
the
sentinel
,
intending
to
release
him
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
But
,
ere
the
Royalists
could
pass
forth
,
they
were
again
delayed
in
an
unexpected
manner
.
<EOS>
The
discharge
of
fire
-
arms
operated
as
a
signal
to
another
set
of
persons
who
had
been
secretly
meditating
an
attack
upon
the
Roundheads
,
and
who
now
found
that
their
design
had
been
anticipated
.
<EOS>
From
the
passage
leading
to
the
buttery
and
kitchen
flocked
some
half
-
dozen
or
more
of
the
household
,
headed
by
Giles
Moppett
and
Crundy
,
and
armed
with
partisans
and
bills
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
Colonel
Maunsel
,
sword
in
hand
,
appeared
at
the
head
of
the
staircase
,
closely
attended
by
Martin
Geere
,
with
a
musket
over
his
shoulder
,
while
a
few
paces
behind
them
were
Mr.
Beard
and
Dulcia
,
with
Patty
Whinchat
.
<EOS>
It
will
now
be
proper
to
explain
how
all
these
persons
chanced
to
appear
with
so
much
suddenness
.
<EOS>
As
may
be
supposed
,
on
that
eventful
night
none
of
the
inmates
of
the
Grange
retired
to
rest
;
and
consequently
they
were
all
aware
that
Stelfax
had
returned
with
a
new
prisoner
.
<EOS>
Though
entertaining
no
hope
<EOS>
whatever
of
accomplishing
his
son
’s
and
Lord
Wilmot
’s
deliverance
from
their
enemies
,
Colonel
Maunsel
did
not
entirely
despair
of
setting
free
the
captive
<EOS>
last
brought
in
.
<EOS>
Who
this
personage
might
be
the
old
Cavalier
was
entirely
ignorant
.
<EOS>
All
the
household
were
firmly
persuaded
it
was
the
king
;
and
though
Colonel
Maunsel
,
who
had
received
an
assurance
to
the
contrary
from
Lord
Wilmot
,
did
not
share
in
their
belief
,
still
he
felt
certain
the
individual
must
be
a
Royalist
of
distinction
—
and
,
in
all
probability
,
a
friend
.
<EOS>
An
effort
must
,
therefore
,
be
made
for
his
liberation
.
<EOS>
Through
the
agency
of
Martin
Geere
and
Giles
Moppett
,
who
were
employed
by
the
colonel
in
preparation
for
this
project
,
the
whole
of
the
household
were
secretly
armed
,
and
commanded
to
hold
themselves
in
readiness
,
in
case
the
attempt
could
be
made
with
any
prospect
of
success
.
<EOS>
So
long
as
the
Ironsides
maintained
an
imposing
force
,
and
,
indeed
,
outnumbered
the
colonel
’s
retainers
,
any
such
attempt
would
have
been
fraught
with
the
greatest
risk
;
but
when
Stelfax
set
off
to
the
church
,
taking
half
a
dozen
men
with
him
,
and
leaving
but
a
slender
guard
of
three
or
four
behind
—
of
which
Colonel
Maunsel
was
made
aware
by
Moppett
—
then
it
seemed
to
the
old
Cavalier
that
the
right
moment
had
arrived
.
<EOS>
But
Moppett
had
a
plan
of
his
own
for
rendering
the
matter
quite
certain
.
<EOS>
With
the
aid
of
his
fellow
-
servants
,
he
undertook
to
secure
three
of
the
Ironsides
in
the
cellar
,
whither
he
knew
they
were
about
to
go
,
and
besought
his
master
to
wait
till
he
could
carry
the
plan
into
effect
.
<EOS>
Though
anxious
for
the
onset
,
Colonel
Maunsel
agreed
to
the
delay
—
or
rather
,
allowed
himself
to
be
persuaded
by
Mr.
Beard
to
adopt
this
prudent
course
.
<EOS>
The
good
clergyman
and
his
daughter
had
remained
with
the
colonel
to
a
late
hour
,
and
finding
it
was
his
intention
to
watch
throughout
the
night
,
Mr.
Beard
desired
permission
to
keep
him
company
,
and
of
course
the
request
could
not
be
refused
.
<EOS>
Dulcia
was
unwilling
to
leave
her
father
—
and
Patty
did
not
like
to
quit
her
young
mistress
—
so
they
all
remained
in
an
upper
room
,
which
Colonel
Maunsel
had
chosen
for
himself
when
driven
from
his
own
chamber
by
Stelfax
.
<EOS>
Within
this
room
the
colonel
was
pacing
to
and
fro
,
supported
by
Martin
Geere
,
scarcely
able
to
control
his
impatience
,
and
eagerly
expecting
Moppett
’s
appearance
,
when
the
report
of
a
pistol
,
almost
instantly
followed
by
two
other
shots
,
suddenly
smote
his
ears
.
<EOS>
Drawing
his
sword
,
he
hastened
,
without
support
,
along
the
corridor
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
,
followed
somewhat
more
cautiously
by
the
others
.
<EOS>
Patty
Whinchat
had
snatched
up
a
taper
before
quitting
the
room
,
and
others
of
the
household
,
when
issuing
from
the
buttery
and
kitchen
,
had
brought
lamps
with
them
,
so
there
was
now
light
enough
to
reveal
the
disguised
Royalists
near
the
door
.
<EOS>
Deceived
by
their
accoutrements
,
the
old
Cavalier
took
them
for
Parliamentary
soldiers
,
and
naturally
concluded
they
were
marching
off
with
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
But
his
blood
was
now
up
,
and
although
Mr.
Beard
besought
him
not
to
interfere
<EOS>
and
so
jeopardize
his
own
safety
,
he
shouted
out
to
the
supposed
Roundheads
to
set
free
their
prisoner
instantly
.
<EOS>
Then
turning
to
his
household
,
he
vociferated,“Upon
them
,
my
men!—upon
them!—strike
hard
,
and
fear
not!—I
will
be
down
with
you
on
the
instant
,
and
will
show
you
how
such
crop
-
eared
curs
ought
to
be
dealt
with
.
<EOS>
Upon
them
,
I
say
!
<EOS>
Wherefore
do
you
hesitate?”“They
do
well
to
hesitate
in
attacking
friends
and
supporters
of
the
good
cause
,
Colonel
Maunsel
,
”
cried
Lord
Wilmot
.
<EOS>
“Royalists
in
the
garb
of
rebels
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
old
Cavalier
.
<EOS>
“Ay
,
Royalists
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“
If
you
do
not
recognize
Lord
Wilmot
,
surely
my
voice
can
not
be
strange
to
you?”“Methinks
<EOS>
your
honour
will
recognize
mine
?
”
<EOS>
John
Habergeon
called
out
.
<EOS>
“And
<EOS>
mine
also
,
I
am
assured
?
”
<EOS>
Ninian
added
.
<EOS>
“I
know
you
all
now
,
”
cried
the
colonel
,
who
had
been
for
a
moment
speechless
with
astonishment
.
<EOS>
“
Come
to
my
arms
,
my
dear
boy
,
that
I
may
embrace
thee
once
more
!
”
<EOS>
he
added
,
hurrying
down
the
staircase
in
a
delirium
of
joy
,
while
Clavering
sprang
forward
to
meet
him
.
<EOS>
“
Art
thou
indeed
free
?
”
<EOS>
he
cried
,
catching
the
young
man
in
his
arms
,
and
folding
him
to
his
breast
.
<EOS>
“Free
as
yourself
,
father
,
”
Clavering
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
We
have
left
those
caitiff
Roundheads
in
our
places
in
the
church
.
”“Amazement
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
colonel
.
<EOS>
“
This
passes
all
my
comprehension
.
<EOS>
”“Your
<EOS>
honour
would
be
still
more
amazed
if
you
could
hear
how
it
has
been
accomplished
,
”
John
Habergeon
remarked
;
“
but
there
is
not
time
to
tell
it
now
.
”While
<EOS>
this
was
going
on
,
the
trooper
who
had
kept
guard
over
Colonel
Gunter
had
been
attacked
by
a
strong
body
of
the
household
,
and
was
now
dragged
forth
by
them
in
triumph
,
with
his
arms
pinioned
with
his
own
belt
.
<EOS>
Seeing
this
,
Lord
Wilmot
consigned
the
sentinel
to
Moppet
and
Crundy
,
bidding
them
take
both
rascals
away
,
and
shoot
them
if
they
thought
proper
.
<EOS>
“Nay
,
we
will
not
put
them
to
death
,
”
said
Moppett
,
“
but
we
will
clap
them
with
their
comrades
in
the
cellar
.
”
<EOS>
And
both
prisoners
were
haled
away
.
<EOS>
“I
must
perforce
tear
your
son
from
your
embraces
,
Colonel
Maunsel
,
”
said
Lord
Wilmot
.
<EOS>
“
We
shall
have
the
Ironsides
back
from
the
church
,
and
then
all
our
trouble
will
be
lost
.
<EOS>
We
came
here
to
liberate
a
brother
Royalist
—
Colonel
Gunter
of
Racton
,
”
he
added
,
in
a
low
voice
,
to
the
old
Cavalier
.
<EOS>
“Ha
!
”
exclaimed
Colonel
Maunsel
,
warmly
grasping
the
hand
of
the
newly-
liberated
prisoner
.
<EOS>
“
I
knew
him
not
,
but
was
about
to
make
an
effort
for
his
liberation
.
<EOS>
However
,
you
have
got
the
start
of
me
.
<EOS>
“Nevertheless
,
I
thank
you
as
heartily
,
Colonel
Maunsel
,
as
if
you
had
been
first
to
help
me
,
”
said
Colonel
Gunter
.
<EOS>
And
he
then
added
,
in
a
low
tone
,
“
We
came
to
consult
with
you
about
procuring
a
vessel
,
either
at
Newhaven
or
Shoreham
,
to
convey
his
Majesty
to
France
.
<EOS>
”“A
word
,
ere
<EOS>
I
answer
you
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
old
Cavalier
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
“
You
can
assure
me
,
I
trust
,
that
his
Majesty
is
in
safety?”“We
have
every
reason
to
believe
so
,
”
replied
Gunter
.
<EOS>
“
Lord
Wilmot
left
him
at
Boscobel
in
the
care
of
loyal
liegemen
,
who
will
guard
him
with
their
life
—
as
you
would
guard
him
,
colonel
.
<EOS>
But
how
think
you
?
<EOS>
Can
a
vessel
be
<EOS>
procured?”“I
doubt
it
not
,
”
said
the
old
Cavalier
.
<EOS>
“
There
is
a
skipper
of
Shoreham
,
named
Nicholas
Tattersall
,
who
is
master
of
a
fast
-
sailing
brig
,
called
the
Swiftsure
.
<EOS>
I
know
him
to
be
an
honest
fellow
,
who
may
be
trusted
in
such
an
enterprise
;
<EOS>
but
,
unluckily
,
he
is
away
at
present
—
at
Plymouth
,
I
believe
—
<EOS>
and
his
return
is
uncertain
.
”“Nicholas
<EOS>
Tattersall
!
<EOS>
I
shall
not
forget
the
name
,
colonel
,
”
replied
Gunter
.
<EOS>
“
If
his
Majesty
should
not
otherwise
be
provided
,
Tattersall
shall
be
our
man
.
<EOS>
”“If
<EOS>
we
ourselves
do
not
depart
at
once
we
shall
have
small
chance
of
lending
his
Majesty
further
aid
,
”
said
Lord
Wilmot
.
<EOS>
“
Will
you
not
go
with
us
,
Colonel
Maunsel
?
<EOS>
If
you
stay
,
you
will
have
to
brook
the
rage
—
perhaps
the
vengeance
—
of
that
disappointed
and
savage
Ironside
captain
.
<EOS>
”“I
fear
him
not
,
”
replied
the
old
Cavalier
.
<EOS>
“
I
will
not
quit
my
house
,
unless
forced
from
it
.
<EOS>
”Despite
<EOS>
the
hurry
and
confusion
of
the
moment
,
it
will
not
be
supposed
that
Clavering
—
aware
of
her
presence
—
would
fail
to
seek
out
Dulcia
.
<EOS>
When
his
father
became
engaged
with
Colonel
Gunter
he
instantly
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
offered
him
to
fly
to
her
.
<EOS>
The
poor
damsel
needed
his
support
.
<EOS>
The
sudden
revulsion
of
feeling
she
experienced
was
too
much
for
her
.
<EOS>
Her
lover
’s
fate
had
appeared
to
her
to
be
sealed
.
<EOS>
Escape
for
him
from
the
clutches
of
Stelfax
seemed
impossible
.
<EOS>
Yet
at
the
very
moment
when
such
an
occurrence
was
least
expected
,
he
stood
before
her
—
free
!
<EOS>
Yes
,
free
!
<EOS>
The
garb
in
which
he
was
arrayed
told
how
he
had
escaped
.
<EOS>
But
explanation
was
unneeded
.
<EOS>
Enough
for
her
he
was
out
of
the
power
of
his
relentless
captor
,
who
had
pronounced
that
his
doom
would
be
death
.
<EOS>
After
gazing
at
him
for
a
short
space
intently
,
through
eyes
streaming
with
tears
,
she
gave
utterance
to
a
wild
,
irrepressible
cry
of
delight
,
which
had
yet
something
thrilling
and
painful
about
it
,
and
sank
upon
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Beard
,
who
was
standing
beside
his
daughter
,
watching
her
with
great
anxiety
,
would
have
removed
her
,
but
Clavering
besought
him
to
forbear
.
<EOS>
“Leave
her
with
me
for
a
moment
,
good
sir
,
”
he
said
.
<EOS>
“
My
time
is
short
.
<EOS>
Heaven
only
knows
when
we
shall
meet
again!”“Place
yourself
wholly
in
the
hands
of
Providence
,
my
dear
young
friend
,
”
the
clergyman
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
After
this
display
of
His
mercy
manifested
towards
you
,
you
can
never
doubt
His
ability
to
aid
you
,
if
He
be
so
minded
.
<EOS>
Resign
yourself
,
henceforth
,
to
His
will
and
guidance
.
<EOS>
”“My
<EOS>
heart
is
full
to
overflowing
with
gratitude
to
the
Great
Disposer
of
Events
,
”
said
Clavering
;
“
but
He
would
not
have
us
remain
inactive
.
<EOS>
As
He
prompts
,
we
must
obey
.
<EOS>
If
I
might
counsel
you
,
I
would
urge
you
to
fly
for
a
season
with
Dulcia
from
this
dwelling
,
and
seek
a
more
secure
asylum
elsewhere
.
”“Whither
<EOS>
should
I
go
?
”
<EOS>
Mr.
Beard
replied
.
<EOS>
“
There
is
no
place
of
security
for
me
and
for
my
child
.
<EOS>
No
,
I
will
not
voluntarily
quit
the
house
that
has
sheltered
me
so
long
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
desert
the
patron
who
has
so
long
befriended
me
,
and
who
has
need
of
my
ministry
and
assistance
.
<EOS>
And
my
child
will
tarry
with
me
.
”“To
<EOS>
the
last
,
father
,
”
Dulcia
cried
,
raising
her
head
.
<EOS>
“
My
place
is
near
your
side
,
and
I
will
never
abandon
it
.
<EOS>
”“I
would
not
have
you
do
so
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“
But
it
drives
me
almost
to
distraction
to
think
what
may
happen
when
that
fierce
Republican
officer
returns
.
<EOS>
I
cannot
—
will
not
leave
you
.
<EOS>
“You
<EOS>
must
—
you
must
,
dear
Clavering
,
”
said
Dulcia
.
<EOS>
“
Fly
with
your
friends
,
and
think
not
of
us
,
or
think
that
we
are
under
the
protection
of
a
watchful
Providence
.
<EOS>
Your
staying
here
would
not
add
to
our
security
,
and
would
lead
to
your
own
certain
recapture
.
<EOS>
Go!—go
with
my
father
’s
blessing
,
and
my
own
heartfelt
wishes
for
your
preservation
.
<EOS>
Stay
not
a
moment
longer
.
<EOS>
Pray
Heaven
<EOS>
you
have
not
stayed
too
long
<EOS>
already!”This
latter
exclamation
was
caused
by
a
movement
of
alarm
among
the
Royalists
.
<EOS>
A
noise
was
heard
outside
,
announcing
the
return
of
Stelfax
and
his
men
.
<EOS>
“They
are
upon
us
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Lord
Wilmot
.
<EOS>
“
Secure
the
door
,
and
extinguish
the
lights
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
latter
order
was
instantly
obeyed
,
and
the
first
part
of
the
directions
was
attended
to
with
equal
promptitude
by
John
Habergeon
and
Ninian
,
who
,
flying
to
the
door
,
bolted
and
barred
it
.
<EOS>
Before
proceeding
further
,
we
may
mention
that
Ninian
had
found
Patty
’s
presence
as
irresistible
as
that
of
Dulcia
proved
to
his
young
master
.
<EOS>
Marching
up
to
her
in
military
fashion
,
but
with
rather
more
swagger
in
his
gait
than
was
consistent
with
his
Roundhead
accoutrements
,
he
tried
to
catch
her
in
his
arms
.
<EOS>
Patty
either
did
not
recognize
him
at
first
in
his
disguise
,
or
pretended
not
to
do
so
,
for
she
screamed
slightly
,
and
checked
his
attempted
familiarity
by
a
sound
box
on
the
ear
.
<EOS>
However
,
an
explanation
quickly
ensued
,
and
she
was
congratulating
him
on
his
escape
,
when
the
alarm
of
Stelfax
’s
return
was
given
as
above
narrated
,
and
the
young
falconer
suddenly
recalled
to
sterner
duties
.
<EOS>
The
door
,
which
was
of
oak
and
of
considerable
strength
,
possessing
,
moreover
,
ponderous
bolts
and
bars
,
was
only
just
barricaded
in
time
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
it
was
forcibly
tried
,
and
the
voice
of
Stelfax
was
heard
furiously
demanding
admittance
.
<EOS>
The
windows
in
front
of
the
old
mansion
were
deeply
embayed
,
and
projected
far
beyond
the
walls
.
<EOS>
They
were
built
of
stone
,
with
massive
upright
posts
and
transverse
bars
;
and
the
divisions
between
the
bars
were
secured
by
iron
stanchions
,
so
that
,
although
only
curtains
were
drawn
inside
no
danger
of
unlicensed
entrance
into
the
house
was
to
be
apprehended
.
<EOS>
Finding
the
door
solid
enough
to
resist
all
his
efforts
to
burst
it
open
,
Stelfax
turned
his
attention
to
the
windows
lighting
the
hall
,
and
which
were
at
no
great
height
from
the
ground
.
<EOS>
But
here
,
again
,
he
was
disappointed
,
as
was
shown
by
his
exclamations
,
which
,
being
uttered
in
a
loud
key
,
were
quite
audible
to
those
inside
.
<EOS>
“They
are
here
,
”
cried
the
Ironside
captain
.
<EOS>
“
I
am
well
assured
of
it
.
<EOS>
What
ho
!
<EOS>
within
,
”
he
vociferated
.
<EOS>
“
I
summon
you
to
surrender
in
the
name
of
the
Republic
.
<EOS>
Ye
will
be
put
to
death
if
you
resist
.
<EOS>
”“Away
with
you
upstairs
!
”
cried
Colonel
Maunsel
to
Mr.
Beard
and
the
women
.
<EOS>
“
Get
out
of
harm
’s
way
as
quickly
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
We
shall
have
hot
work
presently
.
<EOS>
Take
care
of
yourselves
,
and
find
some
shelter
,
”
he
added
to
the
others
.
<EOS>
“
They
are
about
to
fire
upon
us
.
<EOS>
”Thus
<EOS>
cautioned
,
such
members
of
the
household
as
were
left
in
the
hall
beat
a
hasty
retreat
into
the
passage
leading
to
the
buttery
;
Dulcia
and
Patty
skipped
up
the
great
staircase
,
followed
more
leisurely
by
Mr.
Beard
,
who
deemed
it
inconsistent
with
his
calling
to
display
haste
even
at
a
moment
of
danger
;
while
the
others
stepped
quickly
into
the
banqueting
-
room
,
the
door
of
which
was
open
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
a
loud
explosion
was
heard
.
<EOS>
A
volley
of
shot
was
poured
against
one
of
the
windows
,
shivering
the
beautiful
stained
glass
within
it
,
while
several
of
the
bullets
struck
against
the
foot
of
the
grand
staircase
.
<EOS>
Luckily
,
no
further
damage
was
done
.
<EOS>
“Now
<EOS>
make
for
your
horses
with
all
possible
dispatch
,
”
cried
Colonel
Maunsel
to
Lord
Wilmot
and
the
others
.
<EOS>
“
These
knaves
will
go
to
the
back
of
the
house
next
,
and
try
to
cut
off
you
retreat
.
<EOS>
”“On
<EOS>
my
soul
,
I
am
half
inclined
to
stay
and
give
them
battle
,
”
Lord
Wilmot
said
.
<EOS>
“
We
are
equal
to
them
in
numbers
,
I
think
,
without
counting
your
servants
.
<EOS>
”“My
<EOS>
servants
must
not
be
counted
,
my
lord
,
”
the
old
Cavalier
replied
.
<EOS>
“
They
would
go
for
nothing
in
a
conflict
of
this
kind
,
but
,
however
disposed
you
may
be
for
an
engagement
with
the
rascals
<EOS>
,
I
would
beg
of
you
to
depart
.
<EOS>
You
owe
it
to
his
Majesty
to
care
for
your
own
safety
.
<EOS>
”“That
is
true
,
”
Lord
Wilmot
replied
.
<EOS>
“
And
it
decides
me
to
shun
an
encounter
with
them
,
if
it
can
be
helped
.
<EOS>
But
will
you
not
go
with
us?”“No
,
my
lord
,
”
Colonel
Maunsel
replied
,
firmly
.
<EOS>
“
My
place
is
here
.
<EOS>
To
your
horses
as
fast
as
you
can
!
<EOS>
Heaven
grant
these
Roundheads
reach
not
the
back
of
<EOS>
the
house
ere
<EOS>
you
get
out
.
<EOS>
Ninian
will
show
you
the
way
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
no
other
place
of
refuge
,
go
to
the
Star
at
Alfriston
,
where
you
are
certain
to
find
shelter
.
<EOS>
John
Habergeon
knows
the
house
well
.
<EOS>
Adieu
,
my
dear
lord!—and
adieu
to
all!”On
<EOS>
this
the
Royalist
hurried
across
the
hall
,
and
,
guided
by
Ninian
,
tracked
the
passage
leading
to
the
buttery
,
and
made
for
the
outlet
at
the
rear
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Clavering
lingered
behind
for
a
moment
to
receive
his
father
’s
blessing
,
and
then
speeded
after
the
others
.
<EOS>
A
walled
enclosure
,
possessing
two
or
three
outlets
leading
to
different
parts
of
the
premises
,
protected
the
back
part
of
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
The
nearest
way
to
the
spot
where
the
horses
were
stationed
lay
through
the
farm
-
yard
,
but
if
this
course
had
been
taken
,
the
fugitive
Royalists
must
at
once
have
encountered
the
enemy
,
and
Ninian
therefore
led
them
by
a
roundabout
course
through
the
garden
,
with
which
one
of
the
doors
in
the
yard
communicated
.
<EOS>
We
have
stated
that
Clavering
was
the
last
to
come
forth
,
and
ere
he
stepped
into
the
yard
,
all
the
others
had
crossed
it
and
passed
into
the
garden
,
with
the
single
exception
of
John
Habergeon
.
<EOS>
The
old
trooper
waited
for
his
young
master
,
and
it
was
well
he
did
so
.
<EOS>
While
Clavering
was
hurrying
towards
the
outlet
which
John
held
open
for
him
,
urging
him
to
look
quick
,
for
the
red-
coats
were
at
hand
(
as
was
,
indeed
,
evident
by
the
noise
)
,
<EOS>
a
door
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
yard
was
burst
open
,
and
in
rushed
Stelfax
and
his
men
.
<EOS>
Though
the
place
was
obscure
,
the
light
of
the
moon
betrayed
Clavering
to
his
foes
,
and
the
infuriated
Roundhead
leader
made
a
bound
towards
him
like
that
of
a
tiger
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
balked
of
his
prey
,
just
when
he
fancied
he
had
it
in
his
grasp
.
<EOS>
Clavering
succeeded
in
passing
through
the
door
,
which
was
clapped
to
in
the
face
of
his
pursuer
by
John
Habergoen
.
<EOS>
The
door
could
be
bolted
on
the
inner
side
,
but
on
the
outer
,
or
garden
side
,
there
was
only
an
iron
handle
connected
with
the
latch
.
<EOS>
Seizing
this
handle
,
John
urged
his
young
master
to
fly
,
telling
him
he
could
hold
the
door
for
a
minute
or
two
,
and
then
should
be
able
to
take
care
of
himself
.
<EOS>
The
old
trooper
’s
tone
of
determination
was
not
to
be
mistaken
,
so
Clavering
flew
across
the
garden
in
the
direction
taken
by
the
other
fugitives
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
Stelfax
tugged
with
all
his
might
against
the
door
,
but
John
maintained
it
firmly
against
him
,
until
,
hearing
the
other
prepare
to
fire
at
him
through
the
boards
,
he
deemed
it
prudent
to
let
go
,
and
decamped
just
in
time
to
avoid
the
lodgement
of
a
bullet
in
his
body
.
<EOS>
Speeding
with
the
swiftness
of
lightning
across
the
grass
-
plot
,
he
tried
to
gain
the
screen
of
the
yew
-
tree
avenue
.
<EOS>
But
ere
he
got
half
way
to
it
,
the
Ironsides
were
out
and
after
him
.
<EOS>
Several
shots
were
fired
at
him
,
and
one
or
two
of
them
must
have
checked
his
career
,
if
he
had
not
been
provided
with
steel
cap
and
back
-
piece
,
both
of
which
were
bullet
-
proof
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
he
got
off
unscathed
,
and
,
passing
through
a
gate
,
reached
the
little
thicket
at
the
back
of
the
garden
.
<EOS>
The
report
of
the
fire
-
arms
had
alarmed
his
friends
;
all
of
whom
,
Clavering
included
,
had
reached
their
horses
,
and
were
already
in
the
saddle
.
<EOS>
Guessing
what
had
happened
,
and
fearing
John
might
be
shot
or
captured
,
yet
anxious
to
lend
him
aid
,
they
rode
towards
the
garden
gate
,
and
had
the
satisfaction
to
see
him
issue
from
it
unhurt
.
<EOS>
The
old
trooper
shouted
for
joy
at
the
sight
of
his
friends
,
and
in
another
instant
was
on
the
back
of
the
steed
,
the
bridle
of
which
was
held
for
him
by
Ninian
.
<EOS>
Hardly
was
this
accomplished
,
when
Stelfax
and
his
men
appeared
.
<EOS>
On
beholding
the
foe
,
Lord
Wilmot
drew
his
sword
,
and
calling
upon
his
companions
to
follow
him
,
charged
the
Roundheads
,
resolved
to
hew
them
down
.
<EOS>
But
the
Ironside
leader
did
not
care
to
abide
the
attack
.
<EOS>
His
own
pistols
and
the
carabines
of
his
men
had
been
discharged
,
and
time
had
not
been
allowed
them
to
reload
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
gave
the
word
to
retreat
into
the
garden
,
and
the
command
was
promptly
obeyed
.
<EOS>
Satisfied
with
this
success
,
and
not
caring
to
continue
the
struggle
,
the
Royalists
contented
themselves
with
a
loud
triumphant
shout
that
made
the
holt
ring
again
,
and
rode
off
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
<EOS>
IIIThe
Night
Ride
To
Newhaven
—
<EOS>
The
Brig
And
The
FrigateLORD
WILMOT
determined
to
act
upon
Colonel
Maunsel
’s
suggestion
,
and
seek
an
asylum
at
the
Star
at
Alfriston
;
and
both
Colonel
Gunter
and
Clavering
approved
of
the
plan
.
<EOS>
John
Habergeon
undertook
to
get
them
secretly
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
To
reach
Alfriston
,
they
must
proceed
by
Newhaven
;
for
,
<EOS>
although
the
former
village
lay
a
few
miles
to
the
south
-
east
of
the
little
seaport
at
the
mouth
of
the
Ouse
,
the
river
had
to
be
crossed
,
and
this
could
only
be
accomplished
either
by
the
ferry
at
Newhaven
or
the
bridge
at
Lewes
.
<EOS>
Towards
Newhaven
,
therefore
,
they
directed
their
course
.
<EOS>
The
night
was
clear
and
calm
,
and
a
crescent
moon
hung
like
a
lamp
in
the
deep
starlit
vault
.
<EOS>
It
was
about
the
second
hour
after
midnight
,
and
had
any
one
seen
the
troop
careering
over
the
downs
at
that
lonesome
time
,
they
might
have
been
judged
to
be
bent
on
some
dark
design
.
<EOS>
But
to
newly
-
escaped
captives
,
as
they
all
were
,
the
sense
of
freedom
was
inexpressibly
delightful
.
<EOS>
It
being
a
principle
with
the
Cavaliers
to
banish
care
,
and
make
the
most
of
the
passing
moment
,
they
all
appeared
in
good
spirits
.
<EOS>
The
fineness
of
the
night
,
the
fresh
air
,
and
the
pleasant
and
wholesome
exercise
so
exhilarated
them
,
that
Lord
Wilmot
and
Colonel
Gunter
soon
became
quite
cheerful
,
and
even
Clavering
shook
off
his
misgivings
.
<EOS>
Pursuing
their
way
,
in
the
first
instance
,
along
the
undulating
ridge
of
the
hill
trending
towards
the
coast
,
they
passed
an
ancient
barrow
,
and
a
fire-
beacon
contiguous
to
it
,
which
latter
occupied
the
site
of
the
present
windmill
,
until
they
came
to
the
Newhaven
road
,
skirting
which
,
and
keeping
on
the
turf
,
they
descended
the
gentle
declivity
dipping
into
Rottingdean
.
<EOS>
And
here
we
may
,
parenthetically
,
remark
,
that
no
more
delightful
ride
or
walk
can
be
found
in
any
part
of
the
kingdom
than
is
to
be
had
by
following
the
line
of
coast
between
Brighton
and
Newhaven
.
<EOS>
Fine
turf
,
which
need
never
be
quitted
,
is
to
be
found
the
whole
way
.
<EOS>
A
little
to
the
west
of
Rottingdean
the
cliffs
form
a
natural
terrace
carpeted
with
sod
as
smooth
as
velvet
,
redolent
of
wild
thyme
and
other
fragrant
herbs
,
and
commanding
splendid
sea
-
views
;
but
,
indeed
,
nearly
the
same
thing
may
be
said
of
eight
miles
out
of
the
nine
.
<EOS>
The
elasticity
of
the
turf
,
and
the
freshness
of
the
breeze
,
make
exercise
taken
under
such
circumstances
a
delightful
recreation
.
<EOS>
Rottingdean
,
a
village
of
some
antiquity
,
was
then
nearly
as
large
as
it
is
at
the
present
time
.
<EOS>
A
few
little
tenements
,
occupied
by
fishermen
,
were
built
near
the
shore
,
but
the
better
sort
of
habitations
lay
further
up
the
valley
,
near
the
church
.
<EOS>
Three
or
four
broad
-
bottomed
boats
were
hauled
up
,
high
and
dry
,
on
the
shingly
beach
,
but
there
were
no
other
evidences
of
any
maritime
calling
on
the
part
of
the
inhabitants
.
<EOS>
The
whole
village
seemed
fast
asleep
.
<EOS>
Not
a
dog
barked
as
the
Royalists
rode
past
the
cottages
,
and
mounted
the
opposite
hill
.
<EOS>
At
that
time
the
Sussex
roads
were
accounted
among
the
worst
in
England
,
and
as
the
best
were
bad
enough
,
their
condition
may
be
surmised
.
<EOS>
The
ascents
were
excessively
steep
,
and
the
descents
proportionately
dangerous
.
<EOS>
The
ruts
were
tremendous
;
and
in
bad
weather
,
or
after
the
breaking
up
of
a
frost
,
the
chalky
mud
was
so
thick
,
slab
,
and
tenacious
,
that
carts
and
other
vehicles
often
stuck
fast
in
it
,
and
could
with
difficulty
be
extricated
.
<EOS>
The
coast
road
nigh
which
our
Royalists
rode
was
as
indifferent
as
any
in
the
county
,
but
the
turf
on
either
side
of
it
was
exquisite
—
fine
as
a
well
-
kept
bowling
-
green
.
<EOS>
On
gaining
the
brow
of
the
hill
on
the
further
side
of
Rottingdean
,
Lord
Wilmot
allowed
his
gaze
to
range
over
the
sea
,
a
wide
expanse
of
which
here
lay
before
him
.
<EOS>
A
pleasant
breeze
was
blowing
from
the
south
-
east
.
<EOS>
In
the
deep
stillness
of
the
night
the
waves
could
be
distinctly
heard
dashing
upon
the
shore
,
and
rattling
amongst
the
shingles
.
<EOS>
The
beams
of
the
moon
fell
in
a
line
of
quivering
light
athwart
the
waves
,
tipping
their
edges
with
silver
,
and
within
this
line
a
small
brig
could
be
discerned
,
shaping
her
course
towards
the
south
,
as
if
about
to
cross
the
Channel
.
<EOS>
As
he
watched
this
little
vessel
cleaving
her
way
through
the
glittering
waters
,
Lord
Wilmot
could
not
help
exclaiming
aloud
,
“
Yon
brig
seems
bound
for
the
opposite
shore
.
<EOS>
Would
that
the
object
of
our
greatest
solicitude
were
on
board
her!”“In
<EOS>
that
case
,
we
might
say
that
all
our
anxiety
was
ended
,
”
cried
Colonel
Gunter
.
<EOS>
“Not
<EOS>
so
,
”
said
Clavering
,
“
for
if
I
mistake
not
,
there
is
a
frigate
cruising
out
yonder
,
opposite
Newhaven
,
which
will
speedily
compel
the
little
sloop
to
haul
to
,
so
that
if
his
Majesty
were
on
board
of
the
latter
vessel
he
would
inevitably
be
captured
.
<EOS>
”“By
<EOS>
Heaven
,
you
are
right
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Lord
Wilmot
.
<EOS>
“
Rebels
swarm
upon
the
waters
as
they
do
on
the
land
.
<EOS>
These
shores
are
so
jealously
watched
,
that
escape
seems
barely
possible
.
<EOS>
See
!
<EOS>
a
gun
is
fired
by
the
frigate
as
a
signal
to
the
brig
to
stay
her
course
.
<EOS>
”As
<EOS>
he
spoke
,
a
flash
was
visible
from
the
side
of
the
more
distant
vessel
,
<EOS>
followed
soon
afterwards
by
a
loud
report
.
<EOS>
The
sloop
instantly
lowered
her
sails
in
obedience
to
the
summons
to
stay
,
and
floated
listlessly
upon
the
waves
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
hope
no
Royalist
is
on
board
that
little
bark
,
”
exclaimed
Colonel
Gunter
.
<EOS>
“
If
so
,
he
will
soon
be
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
,
for
see
!
<EOS>
a
boat
is
lowered
from
the
frigate
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
Royalists
paused
to
look
on
.
<EOS>
In
another
minute
the
boat
was
manned
,
and
propelled
with
lusty
strokes
by
a
dozen
well
-
armed
seamen
,
accompanied
by
an
officer
seated
in
the
stern
.
<EOS>
“There
<EOS>
they
go
,
in
evident
expectation
of
making
a
prize
,
”
cried
Lord
Wilmot
.
<EOS>
“
Let
us
hope
the
rascals
may
be
disappointed
.
<EOS>
But
as
we
can
render
no
assistance
to
the
good
cause
,
but
may
jeopardize
our
own
safety
by
needless
delay
,
we
had
best
move
on
.
<EOS>
”“We
<EOS>
have
here
a
proof
of
the
great
hazard
his
Majesty
will
incur
by
attempting
this
means
of
escape
,
<EOS>
”
Clavering
observed
to
Lord
Wilmot
.
<EOS>
“
Does
not
the
incident
excite
your
lordship
’s
<EOS>
apprehensions?”“The
risk
will
be
great
,
undoubtedly
,
”
Lord
Wilmot
replied
;
“
but
it
must
be
run
.
<EOS>
The
king
is
exposed
to
greater
perils
on
shore
.
<EOS>
A
fast
-
sailing
sloop
and
a
good
captain
are
what
we
need
;
and
these
requisites
are
to
be
found
,
according
to
your
father
,
in
the
Swiftsure
,
commanded
by
Captain
Nicholas
Tattersall
,
of
Shoreham
.
<EOS>
”“I
know
Captain
Tattersall
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
good
seaman
,
and
a
trusty
fellow
,
”
exclaimed
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“Unluckily
,
he
is
absent
just
now
,
”
Lord
Wilmot
replied
;
“
but
if
circumstances
comple
us
to
wait
,
we
will
have
recourse
to
him
.
”Having
<EOS>
mounted
two
or
three
eminences
,
and
descended
into
as
many
hollows
,
the
party
now
reached
a
flat
upland
covered
with
gorse
and
brambles
,
and
soon
afterwards
the
road
,
instead
of
continuing
along
the
summits
of
the
cliffs
,
turned
off
on
the
left
in
a
rapid
descent
towards
Newhaven
,
which
was
only
about
a
mile
distant
.
<EOS>
From
this
point
,
had
there
been
light
enough
,
the
greater
part
of
the
Lewes
levels
,
with
the
noble
downs
beyond
them
,
would
have
been
visible
,
but
the
distant
landscape
was
buried
in
obscurity
,
increased
by
vapours
arising
from
the
broad
swampy
tract
below
.
<EOS>
About
half
a
mile
off
,
on
a
headland
overlooking
the
quay
of
New
-
haven
,
and
known
as
the
Castle
Hill
,
stood
another
fire
-
beacon
.
<EOS>
Rising
rapidly
down
the
hill
,
and
passing
the
old
church
,
amidst
its
trees
,
on
the
right
,
the
fugitives
dashed
through
the
town
to
the
ferry
.
<EOS>
Though
of
no
great
width
,
the
Ouse
has
a
channel
of
considerable
depth
,
and
the
tide
,
which
runs
up
higher
than
Lewes
,
being
confined
within
narrow
banks
,
rises
with
great
rapidity
,
and
ebbs
with
equal
speed
.
<EOS>
At
the
present
day
the
river
is
crossed
by
a
drawbridge
,
but
at
the
time
of
our
story
the
only
means
of
transit
was
by
the
ferry
in
question
.
<EOS>
When
the
cavalcade
reached
the
bank
,
they
easily
discovered
the
large
flat
-
bottomed
,
punt
-
shaped
boat
,
used
for
the
conveyance
of
men
and
cattle
across
the
stream
,
with
its
huge
oars
and
poles
inside
it
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
chained
fast
to
a
post
on
the
hard
,
and
no
ferryman
was
there
to
set
it
free
or
undertake
its
conduct
across
the
river
.
<EOS>
Our
Royalists
,
however
,
were
not
men
to
be
easily
checked
.
<EOS>
With
the
aid
of
a
stone
,
John
Habergeon
soon
broke
off
the
staple
that
held
the
chain
,
and
he
and
Eustace
Saxby
undertook
to
perform
the
part
of
ferrymen
.
<EOS>
Three
of
the
horses
—
all
that
the
boat
would
hold
at
a
time
securely
—
were
embarked
;
and
these
,
with
the
three
Cavaliers
,
having
been
transported
to
the
other
side
,
the
self
-
constituted
boatmen
returned
for
the
rest
of
the
horses
,
which
had
been
left
in
charge
of
Ninian
.
<EOS>
These
also
,
together
with
the
young
falconer
,
were
safely
ferried
across
the
Ouse
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
and
horses
and
men
being
landed
,
the
boat
was
turned
adrift
,
and
borne
rapidly
by
the
ebbing
current
towards
the
sea
,
John
Habergeon
observing
,
with
a
laugh
,
“
If
those
rascally
Roundheads
should
pursue
us
,
they
will
be
brought
to
a
stop
here
,
for
there
is
not
another
ferry
-
boat
or
a
bridge
betwixt
Newhaven
and
Lewes
.
<EOS>
”On
<EOS>
leaving
Newhaven
,
the
fugitives
took
a
northerly
course
,
and
for
some
time
followed
the
road
leading
from
Seaford
to
Denton
and
Tarring
Neville
.
<EOS>
They
were
now
skirting
a
disused
channel
of
the
Ouse
,
and
could
hear
the
hollow
cry
of
the
bittern
booming
across
the
marshy
levels
.
<EOS>
Enveloped
in
the
mists
arising
from
this
fenny
region
,
they
could
scarcely
see
a
yard
before
them
,
and
had
to
proceed
with
some
caution
,
until
,
after
passing
through
Denton
,
they
struck
across
the
uplands
on
the
right
,
and
soon
got
clear
of
the
fogs
.
<EOS>
They
then
made
their
way
,
regardless
of
all
impediments
,
to
Alfriston
,
where
they
arrived
long
before
any
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
were
stirring
,
and
proceeded
forthwith
towards
the
place
of
refuge
recommended
by
Colonel
Maunsel
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IVThe
“
Star
”
At
AlfristonTHE
Star
at
Alfriston
,
happily
still
existing
,
is
one
of
the
best
specimens
to
be
met
with
of
an
ancient
English
hostelry
.
<EOS>
Dating
back
as
far
as
the
early
part
of
the
sixteenth
century
,
this
curious
old
building
was
originally
designed
as
a
resting
-
place
for
pilgrims
and
mendicant
friars
,
and
was
meant
,
moreover
,
to
afford
sanctuary
to
such
as
claimed
ecclesiastical
protection
.
<EOS>
The
woodwork
of
the
ancient
hostelry
is
enriched
with
quaint
and
grotesque
carvings
,
all
of
which
are
imbued
with
mediæval
character
and
spirit
.
<EOS>
On
either
side
of
the
wide
-
arched
portal
are
saintly
figures
,
and
under
the
windows
of
the
door
may
be
seen
two
snakes
with
tails
entwined
.
<EOS>
At
a
corner
of
the
structure
is
a
large
carved
lion
,
and
over
it
two
apes
sustaining
a
mace
crowned
.
<EOS>
Near
the
sign
-
post
there
used
to
be
a
dog
,
and
beside
it
a
bacchanalian
figure
with
bottle
and
glass
—
but
these
,
and
doubtless
many
other
equally
curious
memorials
of
the
past
,
are
gone
.
<EOS>
Within
,
there
are
other
traces
of
antiquity
.
<EOS>
On
the
main
beam
of
the
principal
room
is
a
shield
,
inscribed
with
the
sacred
characters
I.H.S.How
<EOS>
it
came
to
pass
at
a
period
like
that
in
which
our
Tale
is
laid
,
when
all
ecclesiastical
ornaments
were
mutilated
or
destroyed
by
bigots
and
fanatics
,
that
such
decorations
as
were
possessed
by
the
old
hostelry
of
Alfriston
should
have
been
spared
,
we
pretend
not
to
determine
.
<EOS>
Such
must
have
been
the
case
,
since
they
are
still
preserved
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
were
less
bigoted
than
their
neighbours
,
or
they
may
have
respected
the
idolatrous
carvings
of
the
inn
out
of
regard
for
the
worthy
host
.
<EOS>
Honest
Stephen
Buxted
brewed
such
good
ale
,
sold
such
good
wine
,
and
trimmed
his
sails
so
dexterously
,
that
he
found
favour
with
both
factions
.
<EOS>
Secretly
,
however
,
his
inclinations
were
for
the
Royalists
,
by
whom
,
as
we
have
intimated
,
he
was
trusted
;
many
fugitive
Cavaliers
having
at
various
times
found
refuge
beneath
his
roof
.
<EOS>
Dawn
was
just
breaking
as
the
little
cavalcade
entered
Alfriston
.
<EOS>
Slackening
their
pace
,
they
rode
through
the
village
as
quietly
as
they
could
,
being
anxious
not
to
disturb
the
slumbers
of
the
inhabitants
.
<EOS>
The
fine
old
cruciform
church
,
with
its
lofty
spire
,
round
which
the
jackdaws
were
already
wheeling
,
making
the
welkin
ring
with
their
cawing
,
reared
itself
before
them
.
<EOS>
But
neither
on
this
ancient
structure
,
nor
on
the
mutilated
stone
-
cross
standing
in
the
centre
of
the
street
,
did
the
Royalists
bestow
much
attention
.
<EOS>
Their
object
being
to
gain
secret
admittance
to
the
hostelry
,
they
did
not
halt
before
the
front
door
,
but
turned
down
a
lane
at
the
side
of
the
house
,
and
at
once
proceeded
to
the
stables
.
<EOS>
Here
John
Habergeon
,
in
fulfilment
of
his
promise
,
quickly
managed
to
knock
up
the
ostler
,
who
,
as
soon
as
he
recognized
him
,
came
forth
and
helped
to
convey
their
steeds
to
the
stalls
.
<EOS>
While
this
was
going
on
,
Stephen
Buxted
made
his
appearance
at
the
back
door
of
the
hostelry
,
anxious
to
know
what
guests
had
thus
unexpectedly
arrived
,
but
being
completely
in
dishabille
,
having
only
just
sprung
out
of
bed
,
he
did
not
care
to
venture
forth
in
the
chilly
air
.
<EOS>
Seeing
a
Republican
soldier
,
as
he
supposed
,
issue
from
the
stable
,
honest
Stephen
was
about
to
beat
a
hasty
retreat
,
and
shut
the
door
after
him
,
when
Clavering
—
for
he
it
was
who
had
come
forth
—
arrested
him
by
calling
out
,
in
the
Cavaliers
’
shibboleth
,
that
he
was
a
friend
of
Cæsar
.
<EOS>
“A
<EOS>
friend
of
Cæsar
in
the
accoutrements
of
a
rebel
!
”
<EOS>
muttered
Buxted
.
<EOS>
“
Seek
not
to
impose
upon
me
,
good
master
,
”
he
added
,
aloud
.
<EOS>
“
Be
you
whom
you
may
,
you
can
not
enter
the
house
at
this
untimely
hour
.
<EOS>
You
must
tarry
for
an
hour
or
two
within
the
stable
,
and
make
shift
with
clean
straw
for
a
bed
.
<EOS>
”So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
was
again
about
to
retire
,
when
Clavering
once
more
arrested
him
,
by
calling
out
,
“
Do
you
not
know
me
,
<EOS>
Buxted?”“The
voice
sounds
familiar
!
”
<EOS>
cried
the
host
,
pausing
.
<EOS>
“
Surely
it
can
not
be
Master
Clavering
Maunsel
,
of
Ovingdean
Grange?”“You
<EOS>
have
guessed
aright
,
Buxted
,
”
<EOS>
the
young
man
replied
,
advancing
towards
him
,
so
as
to
afford
the
host
a
better
view
of
his
features
;
and
he
then
added
,
in
a
lower
voice
,
“
I
and
some
friends
have
come
to
take
shelter
with
you
,
and
if
you
can
accommodate
us
,
it
is
possible
we
may
remain
with
you
for
a
few
days
—
perhaps
a
week
.
<EOS>
”“You
and
your
friends
shall
be
welcome
,
good
Master
Clavering
,
”
the
host
replied
.
<EOS>
“
I
trust
all
is
well
with
your
honoured
father
.
<EOS>
I
need
scarcely
say
that
the
son
of
Colonel
Maunsel
shall
have
the
best
entertainment
my
poor
house
affords
.
<EOS>
”“Any
entertainment
will
suffice
for
me
,
Buxted
,
”
Clavering
rejoined
;
“
but
there
is
one
with
me
whose
high
rank
demands
more
than
ordinary
care
.
<EOS>
”“High
<EOS>
rank
,
said
you
,
Master
Clavering
?
”
cried
the
host
.
<EOS>
“
Surely
,
it
is
not
our
gracious
master
in
person
?
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
if
it
should
be
,
he
shall
be
welcome
to
all
Stephen
Buxted
<EOS>
possesses!”“I
know
your
loyalty
and
devotion
,
my
worthy
host
,
”
Clavering
replied
.
<EOS>
“
But
this
is
not
the
king
.
<EOS>
I
would
it
were
!
<EOS>
he
could
not
be
in
better
hands
than
yours
.
<EOS>
But
if
your
sovereign
will
not
lodge
with
you
,
you
will
have
one
of
his
Majesty
’s
trustiest
advisers
as
your
guest
.
<EOS>
And
who
knows
but
ere
long
you
may
have
the
king
himself
beneath
your
roof!”“It
would
,
indeed
,
delight
me
to
have
an
opportunity
of
testifying
my
loyalty
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Buxted
.
<EOS>
“
But
bid
your
friends
come
in
at
once
,
and
do
not
remain
out
there
in
the
yard
.
<EOS>
I
hope
your
entrance
into
the
village
may
not
have
been
observed
,
for
we
have
many
curious
gossips
in
Alfriston
,
though
they
are
,
for
the
most
part
,
well
affected
towards
the
king
.
<EOS>
I
will
say
that
for
them
.
<EOS>
”“So
<EOS>
far
as
I
can
judge
,
our
arrival
has
been
wholly
unnoticed
,
”
said
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“
We
did
not
encounter
a
soul
in
the
street
,
and
no
one
that
I
observed
looked
forth
at
us
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
now
go
and
fetch
my
friends
.
<EOS>
”“And
I
will
be
with
them
in
a
moment
,
”
the
host
replied
.
<EOS>
“
I
will
but
go
upstairs
and
put
on
a
few
clothes
,
that
I
may
attend
upon
them
more
decorously
.
<EOS>
”With
<EOS>
this
he
disappeared
,
while
Clavering
crossed
over
to
the
stables
,
and
presently
returned
with
the
rest
of
the
party
,
all
of
whom
entered
the
house
.
<EOS>
As
our
young
friend
knew
his
way
to
the
parlour
,
he
did
not
wait
for
the
host
to
conduct
him
thither
,
but
ushered
Lord
Wilmot
and
Colonel
Gunter
into
the
room
,
where
in
another
minute
they
were
joined
by
the
host
,
who
by
this
time
had
managed
to
put
on
his
doublet
and
hose
.
<EOS>
To
honest
Buxted
’s
inquiries
as
to
what
he
could
bring
them
,
his
guests
replied
that
what
they
needed
most
was
rest
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
he
led
them
at
once
to
sleeping
apartments
,
of
which
there
were
,
luckily
,
several
unoccupied
in
the
house
,
and
he
undertook
to
hide
their
martial
accoutrements
,
as
soon
as
they
should
have
taken
them
off
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
the
whole
party
,
having
placed
their
heads
upon
the
pillow
,
lost
the
recollection
of
their
perils
and
fatigue
.
<EOS>
For
nearly
a
week
did
Clavering
and
Colonel
Gunter
,
with
two
out
of
the
three
followers
belonging
to
the
former
—
namely
,
John
Habergeon
and
the
elder
Saxby
—
remain
at
the
Star
.
<EOS>
During
this
time
they
ran
many
risks
of
discovery
,
strict
search
being
made
for
them
throughout
the
whole
district
by
the
Ironsides
;
but
such
were
the
precautions
taken
by
Buxted
,
and
so
great
the
vigilance
and
fidelity
of
his
household
,
that
,
though
on
one
occasion
a
party
of
troopers
actually
came
to
the
house
and
remained
there
more
than
an
hour
,
subjecting
the
host
and
hostess
and
all
their
servants
to
sharp
interrogatories
,
they
failed
to
detect
their
prey
.
<EOS>
On
the
second
night
,
Lord
Wilmot
took
leave
of
his
friends
,
and
set
out
for
Trent
House
,
in
Somersetshire
—
the
residence
of
Colonel
Wyndham
,
a
distinguished
Royalist
—
where
he
expected
to
obtain
tidings
of
the
fugitive
monarch
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
was
attended
by
Ninian
Saxby
,
who
was
to
be
the
bearer
of
intelligence
as
soon
as
there
should
be
any
to
communicate
.
<EOS>
All
such
letters
were
to
be
addressed
with
the
greatest
privacy
to
Colonel
Gunter
’s
residence
,
Racton
,
near
Chichester
,
whither
he
and
Clavering
intended
shortly
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
Endeavours
were
made
by
the
two
Cavaliers
left
behind
at
Alfriston
to
engage
a
vessel
for
the
king
’s
service
,
and
with
this
object
many
secret
visits
were
paid
to
Newhaven
by
John
Habergeon
and
Eustace
Saxby
—
it
not
being
deemed
prudent
that
the
principals
should
be
seen
—
but
without
much
prospect
of
success
.
<EOS>
At
the
expiration
of
a
week
the
two
Cavaliers
began
to
tire
of
the
inactive
life
they
were
leading
.
<EOS>
Clavering
’s
wound
had
nearly
healed
,
and
he
had
quite
recovered
the
use
of
his
arm
,
so
that
he
was
now
fit
for
any
service
.
<EOS>
They
therefore
resolved
to
quit
their
present
asylum
,
and
proceed
to
Racton
.
<EOS>
But
the
Ironsides
being
still
as
much
on
the
alert
as
ever
,
it
behoved
them
to
be
exceedingly
cautious
in
their
movements
.
<EOS>
Disguises
were
therefore
procured
for
them
by
Stephen
Buxted
,
of
such
kind
as
would
be
most
likely
to
elude
suspicion
;
but
,
for
greater
security
,
they
started
on
their
journey
soon
after
midnight
,
and
on
foot
.
<EOS>
We
shall
find
them
at
a
halting
-
place
on
their
way
ere
long
;
but
,
meanwhile
,
we
may
mention
that
Eustace
Saxby
had
left
them
to
pay
a
stealthy
visit
to
Ovingdean
Grange
,
and
ascertain
how
matters
were
going
on
there
;
and
that
John
Habergeon
was
to
make
a
last
attempt
on
that
very
night
to
hire
a
vessel
at
Newhaven
,
the
result
of
which
he
had
undertaken
to
communicate
to
Clavering
and
Colonel
Gunter
in
a
manner
hereafter
to
be
described
.

CHAPTER
VHow
Mr.
Beard
And
Dulcia
Were
<EOS>
TakenAs
Hostages
For
Colonel
MaunselIT
will
now
be
necessary
to
go
back
to
the
night
on
which
the
Royalists
made
their
escape
from
Stelfax
,
in
order
to
see
how
that
officer
comported
himself
after
the
loss
of
his
prey
.
<EOS>
He
returned
to
the
house
breathing
vengeance
against
all
those
who
had
aided
the
prisoners
in
their
flight
—
foremost
amongst
whom
was
Colonel
Maunsel
.
<EOS>
The
execution
,
however
,
of
his
vindictive
schemes
was
deferred
till
the
morrow
,
his
chief
desire
at
present
being
,
if
possible
,
to
recapture
the
fugitives
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
the
Royalists
had
foreseen
great
delay
was
experienced
in
catching
the
horses
,
and
even
when
this
point
was
achieved
,
for
some
time
the
bridles
and
saddles
could
not
be
found
.
<EOS>
But
although
nearly
an
hour
was
thus
wasted
,
the
infuriated
Republican
officer
would
not
relinquish
the
design
of
pursuit
.
<EOS>
Submission
to
defeat
was
intolerable
to
him
,
and
so
long
as
a
chance
remained
of
retrieving
his
discomfiture
,
he
was
resolved
not
to
throw
it
away
.
<EOS>
In
less
than
an
hour
,
then
,
after
the
departure
of
the
fugitives
,
he
started
in
pursuit
,
at
the
head
of
some
seven
or
eight
men
.
<EOS>
Delves
was
left
behind
,
with
orders
to
watch
over
the
house
,
and
though
he
pleaded
hard
to
be
allowed
to
accompany
his
leader
,
permission
was
not
granted
him
.
<EOS>
Stelfax
had
noted
the
course
taken
in
the
first
instance
by
the
fugitives
,
and
galloping
to
Rottingdean
,
ascertained
from
a
fisherman
,
who
had
heard
the
cavalcade
pass
his
cottage
,
that
they
had
gone
on
towards
Newhaven
.
<EOS>
To
the
latter
place
,
therefore
,
Stelfax
rode
with
all
possible
dispatch
,
but
his
mortification
and
rage
were
boundless
,
when
,
on
arriving
at
the
ferry
,
he
found
that
the
Royalists
had
got
across
,
and
that
the
boat
was
turned
adrift
.
<EOS>
Further
pursuit
was
,
therefore
,
out
of
the
question
,
as
he
was
well
aware
there
was
no
means
of
crossing
the
Ouse
nearer
than
the
bridge
at
Lewes
.
<EOS>
After
a
brief
debate
with
himself
,
Stelfax
,
unable
to
brook
the
idea
of
returning
empty
-
handed
,
sent
back
his
men
to
Ovingdean
,
and
rode
on
alone
by
the
western
side
of
the
levels
,
through
Rodmill
and
Kingston
to
Lewes
;
proceeding
at
once
to
the
castle
,
where
the
detachment
under
his
command
was
quartered
.
<EOS>
His
first
business
was
to
call
out
one
-
and
-
twenty
men
,
whom
he
divided
into
three
parties
,
assigning
to
each
a
separate
district
—
thus
one
party
was
instructed
to
make
a
perquisition
of
the
coast
,
from
Seaford
to
Eastbourne
;
another
the
mid
-
country
,
comprehending
Beddingham
,
the
Firle
range
of
downs
,
Alciston
,
Selmeston
,
and
Hailsham
;
and
a
third
Mount
Caburn
,
Glynde
,
Laughton
,
and
Ringmer
.
<EOS>
The
men
were
,
in
short
,
to
scour
the
whole
country
to
the
south
-
east
to
Lewes
,
making
a
circuit
of
fifteen
or
twenty
miles
,
or
more
if
needed
,
and
not
to
return
without
bringing
the
fugitives
with
them
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
Stelfax
’s
intention
to
take
the
command
of
one
of
these
parties
,
but
he
began
to
find
that
fatigue
had
made
some
inroads
even
upon
his
iron
frame
,
and
that
if
he
did
not
allow
himself
repose
he
might
break
down
.
<EOS>
Contenting
himself
,
therefore
,
with
giving
such
precise
instructions
to
the
men
as
he
fancied
must
ensure
the
accomplishment
of
his
purpose
,
he
flung
himself
upon
his
hard
soldier
’s
couch
,
and
became
presently
oblivious
of
his
cares
.
<EOS>
His
instructions
were
carefully
obeyed
.
<EOS>
The
whole
district
he
had
indicated
was
traversed
by
his
men
;
but
without
effect
.
<EOS>
No
traces
of
the
fugitives
could
be
detected
.
<EOS>
Whither
they
had
gone
after
leaving
Newhaven
<EOS>
was
a
mystery
that
could
not
be
solved
—
no
one
appearing
to
have
seen
them
.
<EOS>
Even
when
the
pursuers
were
really
on
the
right
scent
,
they
remained
at
fault
.
<EOS>
A
visit
,
as
we
have
already
mentioned
,
was
paid
to
the
Star
at
Alfriston
;
but
though
the
whole
of
the
fugitives
were
at
that
time
in
the
hostelry
,
they
were
so
well
concealed
that
not
the
slightest
suspicion
of
their
propinquity
was
entertained
by
the
Ironsides
.
<EOS>
In
anticipation
of
a
visit
of
the
kind
,
the
horses
brought
off
by
the
Royalists
had
been
removed
to
an
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
shed
at
some
distance
from
the
inn
.
<EOS>
Luckily
,
no
one
in
the
village
had
witnessed
the
arrival
of
the
fugitives
,
so
betrayal
was
impossible
,
except
by
the
ostler
,
and
there
was
no
fear
of
him
.
<EOS>
From
Alfriston
the
troopers
went
on
to
Wilmington
,
where
of
course
they
did
not
learn
much
.
<EOS>
But
besides
missing
the
objects
of
their
quest
,
all
three
parties
were
more
than
once
duped
by
false
intelligence
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
their
disappointment
,
the
search
was
continued
throughout
the
day
,
and
it
was
only
at
nightfall
that
the
three
divisions
returned
to
Lewes
,
and
faced
their
wrathful
leader
.
<EOS>
Their
failure
was
a
heavy
blow
to
Stelfax
.
<EOS>
He
had
delayed
his
return
to
Ovingdean
till
night
,
hoping
to
go
back
in
triumph
.
<EOS>
But
shame
,
and
the
sense
of
discomfiture
,
detained
him
till
the
next
day
,
when
,
determined
to
make
an
imposing
appearance
,
he
rode
thither
at
the
head
of
fifty
men
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
owing
to
the
exertions
of
the
sergeant
,
discipline
had
been
completely
restored
among
the
men
left
under
his
charge
.
<EOS>
Helpless
Henly
and
the
two
others
,
who
had
been
guilty
of
insubordination
and
drunkenness
,
were
still
under
arrest
.
<EOS>
Delves
was
therefore
able
to
give
a
satisfactory
account
of
himself
to
his
leader
but
it
was
not
equally
satisfactory
to
Stelfax
to
learn
that
Colonel
Maunsel
was
dangerously
ill
,
and
entirely
confined
to
his
bed
.
<EOS>
The
vexations
and
anxieties
undergone
by
the
old
Cavalier
had
proved
too
much
for
him
.
<EOS>
On
the
day
after
his
son
’s
escape
with
the
other
Royalists
,
he
was
unable
to
leave
his
couch
,
and
his
enfeebled
condition
greatly
alarmed
those
in
attendance
upon
him
.
<EOS>
No
improvement
had
taken
place
in
his
health
,
but
rather
the
reverse
,
when
Stelfax
arrived
at
the
Grange
.
<EOS>
Without
making
any
remark
on
the
information
he
had
received
,
but
determined
to
judge
for
himself
,
the
Ironside
leader
marched
at
once
to
the
room
in
which
the
colonel
was
lying
,
and
found
him
supported
by
pillows
,
and
looking
the
picture
of
death
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Beard
and
Dulcia
were
seated
by
the
couch
,
and
the
former
had
a
Bible
on
his
knee
.
<EOS>
Both
arose
as
Stelfax
entered
,
and
the
old
Cavalier
made
an
effort
to
raise
himself
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
not
a
word
was
said
.
<EOS>
The
stern
Republican
officer
folded
his
arms
upon
his
breast
,
and
gazed
steadfastly
,
but
not
without
a
slight
touch
of
compassion
in
his
glance
,
at
the
invalided
,
but
still
noble
-
looking
gentleman
before
him
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
said,“I
have
come
to
carry
you
a
prisoner
to
Lewes
,
Colonel
Maunsel
.
<EOS>
Are
you
ready
to
go?”“You
must
prepare
a
litter
for
my
transport
,
”
the
old
Cavalier
replied
,
feebly
.
<EOS>
“
I
can
not
move
a
limb
.
”“Surely
<EOS>
,
sir
,
”
cried
Mr.
Beard
to
Stelfax
,
“
if
you
have
any
touch
of
humanity
in
your
composition
you
will
not
attempt
to
move
the
colonel
in
this
state
.
<EOS>
He
will
never
reach
Lewes
alive
.
<EOS>
”Dulcia
<EOS>
cast
a
supplicating
look
at
the
Roundhead
leader
,
but
did
not
speak
.
<EOS>
“Waste
not
your
time
in
idle
entreaties
,
my
good
friend
,
”
observed
Colonel
Maunsel
,
feebly
.
<EOS>
“
I
know
the
ruthless
and
inflexible
character
of
this
man
too
well
to
suppose
him
accessible
to
the
common
dictates
of
humanity
.
<EOS>
Take
me
,
sir
,
”
he
continued
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
“
Bid
your
soldiers
bear
me
,
living
,
to
the
grave
.
”“Remove
<EOS>
him
at
your
proper
peril
,
sir
,
”
exclaimed
Mr.
Beard
.
<EOS>
“
I
warn
you
again
that
he
is
dangerously
ill
.
<EOS>
If
he
dies
by
the
way
,
his
death
will
lie
at
your
door
.
<EOS>
”“Such
<EOS>
an
occurrence
,
were
it
to
take
place
,
would
not
trouble
me
much
,
”
Stelfax
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
But
I
have
no
personal
animosity
to
Colonel
Maunsel
,
who
,
though
an
inveterate
malignant
,
is
a
brave
man
,
and
I
should
be
loth
to
abridge
the
little
life
left
him
.
<EOS>
I
will
,
therefore
,
consent
to
leave
him
undisturbed
if
a
hostage
be
given
me
for
his
surrender
in
the
event
of
recovery
.
<EOS>
”“What
<EOS>
hostage
<EOS>
do
you
require
,
sir
?
”
demanded
Mr.
Beard
,
quickly
.
<EOS>
“
I
am
of
little
account
,
as
compared
with
my
honoured
patron
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
peradventure
,
I
may
suffice
.
<EOS>
”“Not
alone
,
sir
,
”
Stelfax
replied
.
<EOS>
“
I
must
have
your
daughter
as
well
.
”“Accede
<EOS>
not
to
the
proposition
,
my
good
friend
,
”
Colonel
Maunsel
observed
,
faintly
.
<EOS>
“
Above
all
,
place
not
Dulcia
in
this
man
’s
power
.
<EOS>
Let
him
take
me
.
<EOS>
What
are
a
few
hours
more
of
wretched
existence
to
a
sufferer
like
myself
?
<EOS>
Better
—
far
better
!
<EOS>
they
were
ended!”“It
must
not
be
so
,
father
,
”
Dulcia
interposed
.
<EOS>
“
Since
hostages
are
required
,
who
so
fitting
as
we
,
who
owe
all
to
our
generous
protector?”“You
are
right
,
my
child
,
”
said
Mr.
Beard
.
<EOS>
“
The
course
we
ought
to
pursue
is
manifest
.
<EOS>
We
will
go
.
<EOS>
”“I
will
not
consent
to
this
,
”
cried
Colonel
Maunsel
.
<EOS>
“
Dulcia
may
be
taken
to
the
Castle
,
and
placed
in
its
dungeons
or
in
the
martyr
-
cells
beneath
the
White
Hart
,
which
have
of
late
,
as
I
understand
,
been
put
to
their
former
use
.
<EOS>
Such
barbarity
shall
never
be
practised
if
I
can
hinder
it
.
<EOS>
”“I
have
no
design
to
place
either
Mr.
Beard
or
his
daughter
in
actual
durance
,
unless
compelled
,
Colonel
Maunsel
,
”
replied
Stelfax
.
<EOS>
“
All
I
require
is
to
have
them
in
safe
custody
.
<EOS>
They
may
choose
a
lodging
where
they
will
in
Lewes
.
”“Promise
<EOS>
me
that
,
on
your
honour
as
soldier
,
and
I
am
content
,
”
rejoined
the
old
Cavalier
.
<EOS>
“
If
I
am
ever
able
to
leave
this
couch
,
I
will
deliver
myself
up
to
you
,
and
then
their
immediate
release
must
follow
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
I
consider
myself
your
prisoner
on
parole
.
”“Enough
<EOS>
,
sir
,
”
rejoined
Stelfax
.
<EOS>
“
You
have
the
promise
you
require
from
me
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
old
Cavalier
then
addressed
himself
to
Mr.
Beard
,
and
looking
anxiously
at
him
,
said,“Use
<EOS>
my
name
with
Master
Zachary
Trangmar
of
the
Priory
House
,
and
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
he
will
provide
you
and
Dulcia
with
a
lodging
.
<EOS>
”“What
!
<EOS>
the
old
usurer
of
Mock
-
Beggar
Hall
!
”
exclaimed
Stelfax
.
<EOS>
“
I
know
him
.
<EOS>
He
has
rooms
enow
,
and
to
spare
;
but
I
doubt
if
much
furniture
will
be
found
within
them
.
”“There
will
be
sufficient
for
us
if
we
obtain
shelter
,
”
replied
the
good
clergyman
,
fearing
lest
some
fresh
difficulty
should
be
thrown
in
the
way
of
an
arrangement
which
he
thought
beneficial
to
his
patron
.
<EOS>
“
My
daughter
and
myself
will
but
make
a
few
needful
preparations
,
and
we
shall
then
be
ready
to
attend
you
.
<EOS>
”Patty
<EOS>
Whinchat
here
emerged
from
the
corner
into
which
she
had
retreated
on
the
entrance
of
the
Ironside
captain
,
and
besought
his
permission
to
accompany
her
young
mistress
,
which
was
readily
accorded
her
.
<EOS>
Telling
Mr.
Beard
that
he
should
set
forth
in
half
an
hour
,
Stelfax
bowed
a
stiff
adieu
to
the
old
Cavalier
,
and
,
quitting
the
room
,
strode
down
the
grand
staircase
to
the
entrance
-
hall
,
where
he
found
Delves
awaiting
orders
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
the
good
clergyman
and
his
daughter
bade
farewell
—
it
might
be
,
from
the
sad
state
in
which
they
left
him
,
an
eternal
valediction
—
to
their
kindly
patron
;
Mr.
Beard
invoking
blessing
on
the
worthy
gentleman
’s
head
,
and
praying
Heaven
to
spare
him
;
and
Dulcia
,
who
was
drowned
in
tears
,
bending
to
receive
the
colonel
’s
benediction
.
<EOS>
This
parting
over
,
their
place
was
supplied
by
Martin
Geere
,
whose
devotion
to
his
master
left
no
doubt
that
the
old
Cavalier
would
be
carefully
tended
by
him
.
<EOS>
In
allowing
Colonel
Maunsel
to
remain
at
his
own
house
a
prisoner
on
parole
,
and
taking
Mr.
Beard
and
his
daughter
as
hostages
for
the
old
Cavalier
’s
surrender
in
case
of
recovery
,
Stelfax
was
influenced
by
other
motives
than
those
which
he
allowed
to
appear
.
<EOS>
Under
such
an
arrangement
,
Clavering
Maunsel
and
his
friends
were
not
unlikely
,
he
judged
,
to
pay
a
secret
visit
to
the
Grange
,
and
might
—
were
due
vigilance
observed
—
be
recaptured
;
while
,
by
withdrawing
Dulcia
from
her
present
asylum
,
he
would
have
her
altogether
in
his
power
.
<EOS>
Not
wishing
to
alarm
her
and
Mr.
Beard
too
much
in
the
first
instance
,
he
had
proposed
a
lodging
in
the
town
,
and
was
well
pleased
when
the
colonel
mentioned
old
Zachary
Trangmar
,
in
whom
he
felt
sure
a
ready
instrument
would
be
found
.
<EOS>
Such
were
some
of
the
motives
that
influenced
him
;
but
he
might
have
others
,
for
his
designs
were
dark
and
inscrutable
.
<EOS>
But
while
abandoning
Ovingdean
Grange
,
Stelfax
deemed
it
necessary
that
careful
watch
should
be
kept
over
the
house
,
and
no
one
appeared
to
him
—
for
reasons
which
he
scarcely
liked
to
acknowledge
to
himself
—
to
be
so
well
qualified
for
the
office
of
a
spy
as
the
person
who
had
recently
outmanœuvred
him
—
namely
,
Increase
Micklegift
.
<EOS>
But
where
was
he
to
be
found
?
<EOS>
Little
expecting
friendly
overtures
from
the
man
he
had
injured
,
but
dreading
his
vengeance
,
the
Independent
minister
had
fled
.
<EOS>
Stelfax
questioned
Delves
about
Micklegift
,
and
the
sergeant
replied
that
there
was
in
the
village
an
elder
named
Morefruit
Stone
,
who
he
thought
might
be
able
to
communicate
with
the
fugitive
minister
.
<EOS>
Stelfax
immediately
caught
at
the
suggestion
,
and
said:“Hie
thee
to
Stone
at
once
,
and
say
unto
him
,
that
if
he
hath
any
means
of
communicating
with
Micklegift
,
he
may
inform
him
that
I
bear
him
no
malice
for
what
he
hath
done
to
me
and
to
my
men
,
but
desire
to
do
him
a
friendly
service
,
and
to
that
end
request
him
to
come
over
to
me
without
delay
to
the
castle
at
Lewes
.
<EOS>
Lest
he
suspect
that
,
perchance
,
there
may
be
a
design
to
ensnare
him
,
give
him
a
solemn
assurance
of
safety
.
<EOS>
About
thine
errand
at
once!”Delves
departed
,
and
soon
afterwards
returned
with
the
information
that
he
had
seen
Stone
,
and
had
reason
to
believe
he
had
succeeded
in
his
object
.
<EOS>
During
the
whole
time
that
Stelfax
remained
at
the
Grange
,
the
troop
by
whom
he
was
attended
were
not
permitted
to
dismount
,
but
remained
drawn
up
before
the
gates
of
the
mansion
,
where
,
with
their
fine
horses
and
polished
accoutrements
,
they
made
a
gallant
show
.
<EOS>
The
whole
village
turned
out
to
look
at
them
;
and
though
the
household
at
the
Grange
were
in
great
terror
of
a
second
visitation
,
which
might
prove
worse
than
the
first
—
bad
as
that
had
been
—
their
curiosity
at
last
got
the
better
of
their
fears
,
and
they
went
forth
to
enjoy
the
spectacle
.
<EOS>
Greatly
were
Moppett
,
Crundy
,
and
the
rest
rejoiced
to
learn
that
the
unwelcome
guests
whom
they
had
been
obliged
to
entertain
and
serve
for
two
mortal
days
and
nights
,
and
whose
insults
and
ill
-
usage
they
had
endured
for
that
seemingly
interminable
period
,
were
to
be
withdrawn
.
<EOS>
But
their
joy
was
somewhat
damped
by
learning
that
good
Mr.
Beard
and
his
daughter
were
to
be
taken
away
from
them
.
<EOS>
However
,
since
there
was
no
help
for
it
,
they
must
needs
submit
.
<EOS>
All
they
could
do
was
to
pray
for
the
speedy
return
of
the
worthy
pastor
and
Mistress
Dulcia
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
great
matter
that
the
colonel
himself
—
as
they
feared
he
might
have
been
—
was
not
to
be
taken
from
them
.
<EOS>
At
the
appointed
time
the
poor
clergyman
and
his
daughter
,
followed
by
Patty
carrying
a
cloak
bag
and
some
other
trifling
matters
required
by
her
young
mistress
,
descended
into
the
hall
.
<EOS>
By
Stelfax
’s
directions
horses
had
been
brought
round
for
them
from
the
stables
,
and
though
Dulcia
would
have
willingly
declined
his
help
,
the
Ironside
captain
gallantly
assisted
her
to
mount
her
palfrey
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Beard
was
accommodated
with
a
strong
,
steady
-
going
pad
-
nag
,
and
Patty
was
placed
on
a
pillion
behind
him
.
<EOS>
While
this
was
going
on
,
Delves
and
the
troopers
who
had
been
quartered
at
the
Grange
joined
their
comrades
.
<EOS>
Helpless
Henly
and
the
two
others
who
were
still
under
arrest
were
deprived
of
their
arms
and
guarded
,
looking
much
abashed
at
their
ignominious
position
.
<EOS>
All
being
in
readiness
,
Stelfax
sprang
into
the
saddle
,
and
gave
the
word
to
start
.
<EOS>
The
walls
and
gables
of
the
old
mansion
then
rang
with
the
inspiriting
clangour
as
the
trumpeters
sounded
a
march
,
and
the
troop
rode
slowly
out
of
the
village
,
and
mounted
the
hill
on
the
right
,
greatly
to
the
relief
of
the
inmates
of
the
Grange
,
who
felt
as
if
a
heavy
nightmare
were
taken
off
their
breasts
.
<EOS>
Most
of
the
cottagers
,
however
,
followed
the
soldiers
to
the
summit
of
the
eminence
,
and
stationed
themselves
near
the
ancient
barrow
to
watch
the
progress
of
the
cavalcade
over
the
downs
.
<EOS>
The
day
was
fine
,
and
the
polished
casques
and
corslets
of
the
warriors
gleamed
brightly
in
the
sunshine
,
the
long
array
of
martial
-
looking
figures
constituting
a
striking
spectacle
.
<EOS>
No
incident
deserving
mention
marked
the
ride
to
Lewes
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
melancholy
journey
to
Dulcia
,
and
not
all
Stelfax
’s
efforts
,
who
rode
beside
her
,
and
who
was
officious
in
his
attentions
,
could
draw
her
into
conversation
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Beard
was
equally
sad
.
<EOS>
Patty
,
however
,
whose
spirits
were
ever
of
the
lightest
,
was
amused
by
the
novelty
of
the
situation
,
and
thought
it
a
fine
thing
to
have
so
many
stalwart
-
looking
troopers
riding
beside
her
;
some
of
whom
could
not
help
casting
furtive
glances
at
the
pretty
handmaiden
.
<EOS>
On
arriving
at
Lewes
,
Stelfax
conducted
his
prisoners
at
once
to
Mock
-
Beggar
Hall
.
<EOS>
At
first
old
Zachary
Trangmar
peremptorily
refused
to
receive
them
,
alleging
the
want
of
suitable
accommodation
,
but
the
Ironside
captain
overruled
his
objections
,
and
used
such
arguments
with
him
,
that
,
in
the
end
,
though
with
great
reluctance
,
the
old
usurer
assented
.
<EOS>
Eventually
,
therefore
,
Mr.
Beard
and
his
daughter
,
with
her
attendant
,
were
admitted
,
and
took
possession
of
a
suite
of
dismantled
rooms
,
none
of
which
contained
an
article
of
furniture
.
<EOS>
However
,
their
wants
in
this
respect
were
partially
supplied
,
in
the
course
of
the
evening
,
by
Skrow
Antram
and
the
old
couple
whom
we
have
described
as
living
with
Zachary
in
the
capacity
of
servants
.

CHAPTER
VIThe
Shepherds
<EOS>
On
Mount
CaburnSOVRAN
in
beauty
is
Mount
Caburn
.
<EOS>
Fairest
of
Sussex
hills
.
<EOS>
Firle
Ridge
,
with
its
beacon
-
crowned
headland
,
frowning
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
wide
gorge
,
like
a
rival
potentate
,
may
be
a
more
striking
object
—
the
long
and
precipitous
escarpment
of
Kingston
Hill
,
rising
on
the
westerly
side
of
the
Lewes
levels
,
is
imposing
—
Mount
Harry
,
with
its
historical
recollections
,
at
the
back
of
the
old
town
,
has
charms
of
its
own
—
Ditchling
is
loftier
<EOS>
—
Wolstonbury
and
Chanctonbury
have
each
special
and
peculiar
points
of
attraction
;
but
if
we
are
called
upon
to
indicate
the
hill
which
unites
the
greatest
beauty
of
form
with
the
rarest
advantages
of
situation
,
we
should
unhesitatingly
mention
Mount
Caburn
.
<EOS>
Magnificent
is
the
prospect
it
commands
.
<EOS>
Look
where
you
will
the
eye
is
delighted
.
<EOS>
Towards
the
west
lies
the
broad
alluvial
plain
,
known
as
the
Lewes
Levels
,
through
which
the
meandering
and
deep
-
channelled
Ouse
works
its
way
towards
its
embouchure
at
Newhaven
.
<EOS>
Here
,
where
the
narrow
and
tortuous
river
is
itself
unseen
,
its
course
may
be
detected
by
the
craft
it
bears
along
;
for
here
,
not
unfrequently
,
as
has
been
sung
of
the
same
spot.the
sailMajestic
moves
along
the
sedgy
vale
.
<EOS>
Here
,
at
the
present
day
,
may
be
seen
the
swift
locomotive
shooting
along
its
iron
path
towards
the
coast
.
<EOS>
At
the
opposite
side
of
this
wide
plain
—
once
the
bed
of
an
inland
sea
or
marine
lake
—
stand
the
lofty
and
precipitous
escarpments
,
just
mentioned
,
of
Kingston
Hill
.
<EOS>
Turn
but
a
little
to
the
north
,
and
lo
!
<EOS>
the
ancient
town
of
Lewes
rises
before
you
with
its
lordly
castle
and
old
priory
ruins
,
backed
by
Mount
Harry
.
<EOS>
Yon
bold
and
picturesque
headland
in
front
is
Firle
Beacon
.
<EOS>
It
would
almost
seem
as
if
some
diluvian
convulsion
had
torn
these
hills
asunder
.
<EOS>
through
the
wide
ravine
or
valley
,
by
which
they
are
separated
,
now
runs
a
branch
of
the
railway
,
which
may
be
followed
,
if
you
list
,
for
miles
in
a
south
-
easterly
direction
.
<EOS>
Tracking
the
line
of
coast
,
you
discern
Pevensey
Castle
and
Battle
Abbey
.
<EOS>
Close
at
hand
is
pleasant
and
picturesque
Beddingham
,
with
its
antique
and
square
-
towered
church
;
and
nearer
yet
,
at
the
base
of
the
hill
,
delightfully
-
situated
Glynde
,
with
the
old
Elizabethan
mansion
and
well
-
timbered
park
adjoining
it
.
<EOS>
But
turn
again
towards
the
east
and
north
-
east
,
and
let
your
gaze
wander
over
the
vast
district
.
<EOS>
The
view
is
almost
unbounded
—
a
splendid
panorama
,
scarcely
to
be
surpassed
for
variety
and
extent
.
<EOS>
Numberless
hamlets
with
their
churches
,
mansions
surrounded
by
parks
,
detached
farmhouses
and
homesteads
may
be
discerned
in
this
wide-
spread
plain
,
while
in
certain
parts
of
it
the
countless
hedge
-
rows
,
interspersed
with
taller
timber
,
give
it
the
appearance
of
an
immense
garden
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
not
merely
from
the
splendid
prospect
it
enjoys
,
from
the
smoothness
and
beauty
of
its
outline
,
from
its
gentle
undulations
,
graceful
slopes
,
deep
dells
and
hollowed
coombs
,
that
Mount
Caburn
merits
distinction
.
<EOS>
In
addition
to
other
attractions
,
it
possesses
the
most
perfect
specimen
of
an
ancient
entrenchment
to
be
met
with
on
the
Sussex
Downs
.
<EOS>
The
strength
of
this
encampment
shows
the
estimation
in
which
the
position
it
occupies
was
held
.
<EOS>
Circular
in
form
,
with
double
trenches
,
the
outer
of
which
is
broad
and
deep
,
while
the
inner
platform
rises
to
a
considerable
height
,
the
old
defensive
earthwork
looks
almost
as
fresh
as
when
first
constructed
.
<EOS>
Two
centuries
have
,
no
doubt
,
wrought
many
and
great
changes
in
this
part
of
Sussex
;
have
multiplied
its
inhabitants
,
reclaimed
and
cultivated
its
wastes
,
digged
sluices
in
its
marshy
levels
,
and
,
above
all
,
carried
railways
through
its
plains
,
its
devious
valleys
,
and
along
its
coast
.
<EOS>
But
the
general
aspect
of
the
country
is
the
same
.
<EOS>
Above
all
,
Mount
Caburn
is
unchanged
.
<EOS>
In
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
this
majestic
hill
looked
as
smooth
and
beautiful
as
it
does
in
our
own
day
.
<EOS>
The
shades
of
night
had
scarcely
fled
from
the
summit
of
Mount
Caburn
,
when
two
shepherds
—
such
,
at
least
,
their
garb
proclaimed
them
—
emerged
from
the
inner
trench
of
the
encampment
,
and
mounting
upon
the
elevated
platform
withinside
,
gazed
towards
the
beacon
-
crowned
headland
of
Firle
.
<EOS>
The
habiliments
of
these
personages
,
as
we
have
said
,
exactly
resembled
those
of
the
swains
accustomed
to
tend
the
flocks
on
the
downs
.
<EOS>
Each
of
them
wore
a
long
-
skirted
loose
coat
of
grey
serge
,
stout
hobnailed
boots
,
brown
leathern
gaiters
,
and
a
broad
-
brimmed
felt
hat
,
being
furthermore
provided
with
a
crook
.
<EOS>
But
no
dog
followed
them
,
and
if
you
could
have
looked
beneath
those
grey
serge
coats
,
you
would
have
found
that
the
pacific
-
looking
swains
had
pistols
and
short
hunting
-
swords
stuck
in
their
belts
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
if
you
had
peered
beneath
the
hats
pulled
down
over
their
brows
,
you
would
have
seen
at
once
they
were
not
the
simple
rustics
they
professed
to
be
.
<EOS>
Both
of
them
might
be
termed
young
men
,
though
one
of
them
had
the
advantage
of
his
companion
in
this
respect
by
some
years
,
and
both
might
be
accounted
handsome
.
<EOS>
The
younger
of
the
two
,
indeed
,
was
singularly
good
-
looking
.
<EOS>
But
as
there
is
no
need
to
make
a
mystery
of
the
matter
,
we
may
state
at
once
that
they
were
Cavalier
acquaintances
,
though
the
reader
might
have
failed
to
recognize
them
as
such
,
inasmuch
as
the
outward
distinctions
of
the
party
to
which
they
belonged
were
gone
.
<EOS>
Long
scented
locks
and
peaked
beards
had
vanished
,
and
given
place
to
close
-
cropped
heads
and
smooth
-
shaven
chins
.
<EOS>
Metamorphosed
,
however
,
as
they
were
,
the
two
persons
were
no
other
than
Colonel
Gunter
and
Clavering
Maunsel
.
<EOS>
Night
had
but
recently
fled
,
and
the
sun
had
not
yet
risen
to
gladden
the
hills
and
gild
them
with
his
beams
.
<EOS>
Mists
lay
in
the
marshy
levels
on
the
right
,
and
a
thin
curtain
of
vapour
shrouded
Beddingham
,
concealing
all
of
the
village
except
the
square
tower
of
its
church
.
<EOS>
Mists
also
hung
over
Glynde
Place
and
the
woods
adjoining
it
.
<EOS>
But
the
summits
of
the
downs
,
though
grey-
looking
and
somewhat
sombre
,
were
wholly
free
from
fog
;
and
a
ruddy
glow
in
the
east
announced
the
speedy
advent
of
the
sun
.
<EOS>
The
gaze
of
the
Cavaliers
was
turned
towards
the
elevated
ridge
on
the
further
side
of
the
valley
,
but
though
both
strained
their
eyes
in
this
direction
for
some
minutes
,
they
could
not
descry
the
object
they
sought
.
<EOS>
Neither
spoke
,
but
each
continued
to
look
eagerly
towards
the
Firle
heights
.
<EOS>
Each
moment
the
sky
had
been
growing
brighter
and
redder
,
as
if
the
east
were
all
a
-
flame
,
when
suddenly
the
god
of
day
himself
appeared
,
and
,
ere
long
,
the
hills
glowed
with
his
splendour
.
<EOS>
It
was
at
this
juncture
that
the
object
which
our
two
Cavaliers
had
sought
for
so
eagerly
became
visible
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
shepherd
like
themselves
,
a
tall
man
clothed
in
a
long
-
skirted
loose
great
-
coat
,
with
a
crook
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
“He
is
there
!
<EOS>
I
see
him
!
<EOS>
It
is
John
Habergeon
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“
We
shall
now
learn
whether
he
has
succeeded
in
engaging
the
vessel
.
<EOS>
”“He
has
failed
,
”
cried
Colonel
Gunter
.
<EOS>
“
See
you
not
he
holds
the
crook
horizontally
above
his
head
,
as
was
agreed
should
be
the
signal
in
that
event
.
<EOS>
”“I
fear
it
is
so
,
”
Clavering
replied
.
<EOS>
“
But
give
me
your
crook
,
and
I
will
make
the
matter
sure
.
<EOS>
”As
<EOS>
he
spoke
,
he
placed
the
two
staves
crosswise
,
and
held
them
aloft
.
<EOS>
In
answer
to
the
signal
,
the
individual
on
the
opposite
hill
instantly
dropped
his
crook
,
and
extended
his
long
arms
horizontally
from
his
body
.
<EOS>
“There
is
now
no
doubt
whatever
of
failure
,
”
Clavering
observed
,
in
a
tone
of
disappointment
.
<EOS>
“
A
vessel
is
not
to
be
procured
for
the
king
at
Newhaven
.
<EOS>
We
must
seek
for
means
of
transport
across
the
Channel
elsewhere
.
”“Stay
!
<EOS>
he
has
more
to
communicate
,
”
Colonel
Gunter
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
“
He
has
fixed
a
white
kerchief
like
a
small
banner
to
the
hook
of
his
staff
,
and
hoists
it
aloft
.
<EOS>
”“That
<EOS>
is
the
signal
of
danger
,
”
rejoined
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“
And
look
!
<EOS>
he
waves
the
kerchief
thrice
.
<EOS>
The
danger
is
urgent
.
<EOS>
He
himself
is
making
off
.
<EOS>
We
must
fly
.
<EOS>
”“Ay
<EOS>
,
let
us
to
Racton
at
once
,
”
Colonel
Gunter
returned
.
<EOS>
“
Nothing
more
is
to
be
done
here
.
<EOS>
If
we
are
lucky
enough
to
reach
my
house
,
we
can
rest
in
security
,
and
hatch
fresh
schemes
for
his
Majesty
’s
deliverance
.
”On
<EOS>
this
,
they
crossed
the
encampment
,
and
plunged
into
the
devious
and
secluded
dell
on
the
right
.
<EOS>
They
reached
Racton
,
after
many
hairbreadth
‘
scapes
,
on
the
evening
of
the
following
day
.
<EOS>
Nearly
a
fortnight
elapsed
before
John
Habergeon
was
able
to
join
his
young
master
,
and
he
then
brought
word
that
Colonel
Maunsel
had
been
dangerously
ill
—
in
fact
,
at
the
point
of
death
—
but
was
now
better
.
<EOS>
Immediately
on
his
recovery
,
the
colonel
had
gone
over
to
Lewes
to
surrender
himself
to
Stelfax
,
and
procure
the
liberation
of
Mr.
Beard
and
Dulcia
,
who
had
been
taken
as
hostages
for
him
by
the
Republican
officer
.
<EOS>
This
the
colonel
had
accomplished
,
and
he
had
furthermore
obtained
permission
,
on
account
of
his
infirmities
,
to
continue
a
prisoner
on
parole
at
his
own
dwelling
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
sum
of
the
intelligence
brought
by
the
old
trooper
from
Ovingdean
Grange
;
and
it
was
far
better
than
could
have
been
anticipated
.
<EOS>
Information
of
Lord
Wilmot
’s
movements
,
and
of
those
of
his
royal
master
,
was
furnished
by
the
faithful
and
active
emissary
,
Ninian
Saxby
,
who
passed
constantly
to
and
fro
between
the
Cavaliers
in
various
disguises
.
<EOS>
Many
changes
of
plan
took
place
,
but
at
last
it
was
definitively
settled
that
the
king
should
embark
at
Shoreham
,
and
Colonel
Gunter
received
orders
to
hire
Captain
Tattersall
’s
brig
,
the
Swiftsure
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VIIWhat
Happened
At
The
“
Dolphin
”
At
ShorehamOUR
story
must
now
be
advanced
about
a
week
beyond
the
foregoing
date
,
which
will
bring
us
to
the
13th
of
October
,
1651
.
<EOS>
On
the
afternoon
of
this
day
,
two
well
-
mounted
horsemen
,
followed
at
a
respectful
distance
by
a
servant
likewise
on
horseback
,
rode
from
Bramber
towards
Shoreham
.
<EOS>
To
judge
from
their
attire
,
both
horsemen
must
be
Roundheads
.
<EOS>
They
wore
neither
laced
cloaks
nor
laced
bands
.
<EOS>
Their
garments
were
sad
-
coloured
,
and
destitute
of
all
embroidery
,
and
their
hats
tall
and
steeple
-
crowned
,
and
lacking
feathers
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
their
locks
were
cropped
close
to
the
head
.
<EOS>
Their
servant
,
a
tall
,
powerful
-
looking
man
,
well
-
stricken
in
years
,
was
habited
as
became
a
follower
of
such
puritanical
-
looking
masters
.
<EOS>
But
though
the
horsemen
were
dressed
like
Roundheads
,
their
deportment
,
when
not
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
,
would
have
led
to
a
very
different
conclusion
,
and
any
one
who
could
have
listened
to
their
discourse
would
soon
have
learnt
that
they
belonged
to
the
opposite
faction
.
<EOS>
Once
more
we
have
to
announce
our
friends
Colonel
Gunter
and
Clavering
Maunsel
in
a
new
disguise
,
though
it
will
be
scarcely
necessary
,
we
think
,
to
state
that
their
tall
old
serving
-
man
was
John
Habergeon
.
<EOS>
From
its
advantageous
situation
near
the
mouth
of
the
Adur
,
Shoreham
soon
became
one
of
the
principal
harbours
on
the
Sussex
coast
.
<EOS>
At
the
time
of
our
Tale
it
was
much
frequented
,
and
several
sloops
,
with
other
vessels
of
larger
tonnage
,
were
now
to
be
seen
in
the
haven
.
<EOS>
At
low
water
,
the
embouchure
of
the
Adur
,
which
is
of
some
width
,
is
characterized
by
large
,
glistening
banks
of
mud
,
but
as
the
channel
at
this
time
happened
to
be
full
,
it
presented
the
appearance
of
a
broad
and
goodly
river
.
<EOS>
The
ancient
church
,
with
the
habitations
near
it
,
which
could
be
seen
on
the
near
banks
of
the
river
,
was
that
of
Old
Shoreham
;
but
it
was
towards
New
Shoreham
and
its
haven
that
our
friends
bent
their
course
.
<EOS>
Here
,
as
at
the
older
seaport
,
there
is
a
church
of
great
antiquity
and
beauty
;
and
after
passing
this
noble
structure
—
not
without
bestowing
upon
it
a
glance
of
admiration
—
the
disguised
Cavaliers
proceeded
to
the
Dolphin
,
an
inn
built
on
the
edge
of
the
quay
,
much
frequented
by
seafaring
people
,
and
then
tenanted
by
one
Absolom
.
<EOS>
Bridger
.
<EOS>
Dismounting
,
and
giving
their
horses
to
John
Habergeon
,
by
whom
they
were
taken
to
the
stables
,
the
two
friends
entered
the
house
,
and
after
ordering
some
oysters
and
a
bottle
of
sack
,
and
desiring
to
be
shown
into
a
private
room
,
Colonel
Gunter
inquired
of
the
host
whether
he
knew
Captain
Tattersall
,
of
the
Swiftsure
.
<EOS>
“Know
him
!
<EOS>
I
have
known
Nick
Tattersall
since
he
was
a
boy
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Bridger
;
“
and
a
better
seaman
or
an
honester
fellow
does
n’t
exist
.
<EOS>
”“Thou
speakest
warmly
of
him
,
friend
Absolom
,
”
replied
Colonel
Gunter
,
thinking
it
necessary
,
to
support
his
puritanical
character
;
“
but
is
he
in
your
harbour
of
Shoreham
at
present?”“He
<EOS>
was
here
this
very
morning
,
<EOS>
”
Bridger
replied
,
“
by
the
same
token
that
he
discussed
a
cup
of
sack
with
an
egg
in
it
.
<EOS>
He
has
but
newly
returned
from
Plymouth
,
and
will
soon
make
a
trip
to
Poole
,
in
Dorsetshire
.
<EOS>
”“So
<EOS>
I
have
heard
,
”
replied
Colonel
Gunter
.
<EOS>
“
I
have
a
commission
to
give
him
,
and
would
gladly
speak
with
him
,
if
he
can
be
found
.
”“Found
<EOS>
he
can
easily
be
,
I
will
answer
for
it
,
”
Bridger
replied
.
<EOS>
“
I
will
fetch
him
to
you
anon
,
and
you
shall
have
the
oysters
and
sack
without
delay
.
<EOS>
”Not
<EOS>
many
minutes
after
the
host
<EOS>
’s
disappearance
,
the
door
was
suddenly
opened
,
and
a
tall
man
,
clad
in
a
plainly
-
cut
black
cloak
and
Geneva
band
,
and
wearing
a
lofty
steeple
-
crowned
hat
,
peered
inquisitively
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
His
eye
rested
upon
Clavering
,
who
at
once
recognized
him
,
and
was
about
to
address
him
,
when
the
other
raised
his
finger
to
his
lips
in
token
of
silence
,
hastily
retreated
,
and
closed
the
door
.
<EOS>
“Who
is
that
mysterious
personage
?
”
<EOS>
Colonel
Gunter
inquired
,
not
altogether
liking
the
intrusion
.
<EOS>
“
I
hope
he
is
not
an
enemy
—
he
evidently
knows
you
.
<EOS>
”“I
ought
to
regard
him
as
a
friend
,
seeing
that
he
once
rendered
me
a
most
important
service
,
”
Clavering
replied
.
<EOS>
“
But
I
confess
I
distrust
him
,
and
am
sorry
to
see
him
here
.
<EOS>
It
is
Increase
Micklegift
,
who
,
when
our
worthy
Mr.
Beard
was
deprived
of
his
living
at
Ovingdean
,
succeeded
to
the
church
.
<EOS>
He
is
an
Independent
minister
.
<EOS>
Ever
since
he
assisted
Lord
Wilmot
and
myself
,
with
the
others
,
to
escape
from
the
church
,
he
has
never
dared
,
so
<EOS>
I
learn
from
John
Habergeon
,
to
show
himself
at
the
rectory
or
in
the
village
.
<EOS>
I
am
surprised
to
find
him
here
.
<EOS>
”“I
am
sorry
he
recognized
you
,
”
Colonel
Gunter
replied
,
somewhat
thoughtfully
;
“
<EOS>
for
though
he
may
not
suspect
our
errand
,
he
may
be
troublesome
to
us
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
do
not
think
any
danger
is
to
be
apprehended
from
him
,
”
Clavering
replied
.
<EOS>
“
He
is
in
as
much
jeopardy
as
we
ourselves
are
,
and
if
he
were
to
fall
into
Stelfax
’s
hands
little
clemency
would
be
shown
him
.
”“Granting
<EOS>
that
his
conduct
has
compromised
him
with
the
Roundheads
,
”
observed
Colonel
Gunter
,
“
do
you
not
see
,
my
good
young
friend
,
that
he
is
the
more
likely
to
be
anxious
to
purchase
his
safety
,
which
he
might
easily
do
if
he
knew
our
design
.
<EOS>
He
could
make
his
own
terms
with
Stelfax
.
”“True
,
”
rejoined
Clavering
,
uneasily
.
<EOS>
“
I
see
the
danger
.
<EOS>
But
I
trust
it
may
be
averted
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
here
comes
our
host
.
<EOS>
We
will
question
him
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
”“As
<EOS>
he
spoke
,
Master
Bridger
entered
with
the
oysters
and
a
flask
of
wine
,
and
as
he
was
placing
them
on
the
table
,
Clavering
said:“Tell
me
,
worthy
host
,
who
was
the
tall
man
who
looked
into
the
room
just
now
?
<EOS>
He
had
the
air
of
a
preacher
of
the
gospel
.
<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
such
he
is
,
”
Bridger
replied
.
<EOS>
“
I
dare
not
mention
his
name
,
for
he
is
in
some
trouble
with
the
authorities
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
he
mistook
the
door
,
for
he
occupies
the
adjoining
chamber
.
<EOS>
”“What
!
<EOS>
he
is
in
the
next
room
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Colonel
Gunter
,
glancing
significantly
at
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“
Bring
clean
pipes
,
Absolom
,
and
a
paper
of
thy
best
Spanish
tobacco
.
<EOS>
”“Anon
,
anon
!
<EOS>
worshipful
sirs
.
<EOS>
I
have
done
your
bidding
as
regards
Captain
Tattersall
.
<EOS>
A
messenger
has
been
dispatched
for
him
.
<EOS>
”“Show
<EOS>
him
in
on
his
arrival
,
”
said
Colonel
Gunter
.
<EOS>
“You
shall
not
have
long
to
wait
,
then
,
”
answered
Bridger
with
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
“
I
hear
his
lusty
voice
outside
.
<EOS>
Walk
in
,
Captain
Tattersall
—
walk
in

”
he
added
,
opening
the
door
.
<EOS>
“
These
are
the
gentlemen
who
desire
to
speak
with
you
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
shipmaster
who
was
thus
introduced
seemed
a
very
good
specimen
of
his
class
,
and
his
looks
by
no
means
belied
the
favourable
description
of
him
given
by
the
host
.
<EOS>
Apparently
,
he
was
turned
forty
,
but
his
features
were
so
brown
and
weather
-
beaten
that
it
was
difficult
to
determine
his
age
precisely
.
<EOS>
Squarely
built
,
and
somewhat
under
the
middle
size
,
he
had
a
broad
,
good-
humoured
,
honest
-
looking
physiognomy
,
by
no
means
destitute
of
shrewdness
,
and
seemed
every
inch
a
seaman
.
<EOS>
He
was
rather
roughly
attired
,
his
apparel
consisting
of
a
Guernsey
shirt
,
a
loose
jacket
of
stout
blue
cloth
,
ample
galligaskins
,
or
slops
of
brown
flannel
,
nether
hose
of
the
same
colour
,
and
square
-
toed
shoes
.
<EOS>
On
his
head
he
had
a
cap
,
originally
bright
scarlet
,
though
now
somewhat
weather
-
stained
;
but
this
he
doffed
on
entering
the
room
.
<EOS>
“This
is
Captain
Nicholas
Tattersall
,
worthy
sirs
,
”
said
Bridger
,
slapping
the
skipper
familiarly
on
the
back
as
he
spoke
;
“
as
honest
a
shipmaster
—
I
will
say
it
to
his
face
—
as
ever
sailed
.
<EOS>
”“A
truce
to
compliments
,
friend
Absolom
,
”
said
Tattersall
,
bluntly
—
his
voice
was
deep
and
hoarse
,
as
might
be
expected
from
such
a
broad
-
chested
personage
.
<EOS>
“
You
know
I
like
them
not
.
<EOS>
Your
servant
,
gentlemen
,
”
he
added
to
the
others
.
<EOS>
“
You
desire
to
speak
to
me
,
as
I
understand?”“We
do
,
”
Colonel
Gunter
replied
.
<EOS>
“
Pray
be
seated
,
Captain
Tattersall
.
<EOS>
Happy
to
make
your
acquaintance
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Bring
another
glass
,
Absolom
.
<EOS>
Will
it
please
you
to
taste
this
sack
,
captain?”“The
captain
prefers
brandy
,
worthy
sir

hastily
interposed
Bridger
,
“

I
have
a
runlet
of
rare
old
Nantz
,
given
me
by
a
French
skipper
,
which
I
keep
for
his
special
drinking
.
”“Bring
<EOS>
the
brandy
at
once
,
then
,
”
said
Colonel
Gunter
,
“
and
take
care
we
be
not
interrupted
.
<EOS>
”Upon
<EOS>
this
the
host
departed
,
but
almost
immediately
reappeared
with
a
very
promising
-
looking
square
-
shaped
bottle
,
the
contents
of
which
having
been
tasted
by
Tattersall
,
were
pronounced
by
him
to
be
the
right
sort
.
<EOS>
Having
thus
attended
to
all
the
requirements
of
his
guests
,
Bridger
left
them
and
closed
the
door
.
<EOS>
As
he
went
forth
,
Clavering
satisfied
himself
that
no
eavesdropper
was
without
.
<EOS>
Pipes
were
next
lighted
,
and
glasses
filled
.
<EOS>
After
a
few
preliminary
whiffs
,
Tattersall
said,“Now
,
gentlemen
,
what
may
be
your
business
with
me
?
”
<EOS>
adding
,
with
rather
a
droll
expression
of
countenance
,
“
Nothing
against
the
Republic
,
I
hope?”“Oh
<EOS>
no
—
<EOS>
nothing
treasonable
<EOS>
,
”
Colonel
Gunter
replied
,
with
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
Take
another
glass
of
brandy
,
captain
,
and
then
we
’ll
enter
upon
the
business
.
<EOS>
”“Much
<EOS>
obliged
,
but
I
’ve
had
enough
for
the
present
,
”
Tattersall
rejoined
,
dryly
.
<EOS>
“
Come
,
masters
,
speak
out
!
<EOS>
You
need
n’t
be
palavering
with
me
.
<EOS>
Something
’s
in
the
wind
,
I
can
see
plainly
enough
.
<EOS>
What
is
it
?
<EOS>
You
make
believe
to
be
Roundheads
,
but
I
know
on
which
side
your
swords
would
be
drawn
if
it
came
to
a
fight
.
<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
on
which
side
,
in
your
apprehension
,
would
it
be
,
Captain
Tattersall
?
”
demanded
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“On
<EOS>
the
king
<EOS>
’s
,
Master
Clavering
Maunsel
,
”
the
skipper
replied
,
with
a
wink
.
<EOS>
“
Lord
bless
me
!
<EOS>
though
you
have
cropped
your
locks
,
and
put
on
the
raiments
of
the
sanctified
,
do
you
think
I
do
n’t
know
you
?
<EOS>
Here
’s
your
father
’s
health
,
young
sir
,
”
he
proceeded
,
filling
his
glass
from
the
square
-
shaped
bottle
,
“
and
somebody
else
’s
,
”
he
added
,
in
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
“
We
understand
each
other
now
,
gentlemen
,
I
fancy
.
”“We
<EOS>
very
soon
shall
do
so
,
”
replied
Colonel
Gunter
,
with
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
“
You
are
right
in
all
your
surmises
,
Captain
Tattersall
.
<EOS>
I
am
a
loyalist
as
well
as
my
young
friend
Clavering
Maunsel
.
<EOS>
Our
business
with
you
may
be
told
in
a
word
.
<EOS>
We
want
you
to
convey
two
friends
of
ours
—
two
particular
friends
—
privily
across
the
Channel
.
<EOS>
”“Two
<EOS>
particular
friends
,
eh
!
”
cried
Tattersall
.
<EOS>
“
Oh
yes
!
I
do
understand
,
”
he
added
,
with
a
wink
.
<EOS>
“
Very
intimate
friends
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
Why
not
call
them
relations
—
near
relations
—
such
as
fathers
,
or
brothers
,
or
uncles?”“You
mistake
me
,
captain
,
”
rejoined
Colonel
Gunter
.
<EOS>
“
The
gentlemen
in
question
are
relatives
neither
of
Mr.
Clavering
Maunsel
nor
of
myself
.
<EOS>
They
are
merely
friends
.
<EOS>
They
are
not
even
fugitive
Cavaliers
;
but
having
been
engaged
in
a
fatal
duel
,
desire
to
get
out
of
the
way
till
the
affair
has
blown
over
.
<EOS>
”“That
<EOS>
’s
the
plain
English
of
it
,
eh
?
”
exclaimed
the
skipper
,
somewhat
incredulously
.
<EOS>
“
I
see
you
’re
not
inclined
to
trust
me
.
<EOS>
Quite
right
to
be
cautious
.
<EOS>
But
I
thought
young
Mr.
Maunsel
knew
me
too
well
to
doubt
me
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
have
the
most
perfect
confidence
in
you
,
Captain
Tattersall
,
”
said
Clavering
,
“
<EOS>
but—”“But
you
dare
n’t
commit
our
friends
,
”
supplied
the
skipper
.
<EOS>
“
I
understand
.
<EOS>
Well
,
I
’ve
no
objection
to
take
these
unlucky
duellists
across
the
Channel
,
if
you
make
it
worth
my
while
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
offer
for
the
job?”“Fifty
golden
caroluses
,
”
replied
Colonel
Gunter
.
<EOS>
“Humph
!
<EOS>
I
might
have
been
content
with
that
sum
if
they
had
been
political
offenders
—
good
men
,
with
a
price
set
upon
their
heads
—
but
simple
fugitives
from
justice
must
pay
double
.
<EOS>
”“Well
<EOS>
,
we
wo
n’t
haggle
about
the
payment
,
”
rejoined
Gunter
.
<EOS>
“
Let
it
be
a
bargain
.
<EOS>
Say
a
hundred
caroluses
.
”“Fifty
<EOS>
as
earnest
,
or
I
wo
n’t
engage
,
”
cried
Tattersall
.
<EOS>
“Here
they
are
!
”
<EOS>
replied
Colonel
Gunter
,
tossing
him
a
bag
of
gold
,
which
had
originally
come
out
of
Zachary
Trangmar
’s
chest
.
<EOS>
“
Count
them
at
your
leisure
.
<EOS>
”“That
<EOS>
’s
the
way
to
do
business
,
”
said
Tattersall
,
laughing
,
as
he
took
the
bag
.
<EOS>
“
But
mark
me
!
”
<EOS>
he
added
,
with
a
slight
change
of
tone
.
<EOS>
“
I
make
one
condition
.
<EOS>
I
must
see
the
gentlemen
before
I
agree
to
take
them
.
<EOS>
”“But
<EOS>
you
have
agreed
!
<EOS>
you
are
partly
paid
!
”
<EOS>
Colonel
Gunter
exclaimed
,
somewhat
sharply
.
<EOS>
“The
money
shall
be
refunded
,
of
course
,
if
I
ca
n’t
fulfil
my
engagement
,
”
replied
Tattersall
,
coolly
.
<EOS>
“
But
as
I
have
just
said
,
I
must
see
the
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
Seamen
have
strange
fancies
,
and
I
may
n’t
like
their
looks
.
<EOS>
”“I
am
sure
you
will
,
Tattersall
,
”
remarked
Clavering
,
laughing
;
“
Colonel
Gunter
need
not
be
uneasy
as
to
your
stipulation
.
”“Is
<EOS>
this
Colonel
Gunter
?
”
cried
the
skipper
,
eyeing
the
person
named
.
<EOS>
“
I
was
not
aware
of
it
.
<EOS>
Your
humble
servant
,
colonel
.
<EOS>
”“Sir
,
I
am
yours
,
”
replied
Gunter
,
returning
his
bow
.
<EOS>
“
Well
,
then
,
if
the
countenances
of
my
friends
please
you
,
they
are
to
have
a
passage
?
<EOS>
Is
it
so?”Tattersall
nodded
assent
,
but
did
not
remove
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
“When
can
you
start
?
”
<EOS>
pursued
Gunter
.
<EOS>
“The
wind
is
sou’-west
,
and
not
favourable
for
crossing
the
Channel
,
”
the
skipper
replied
;
“
and
I
must
get
in
my
cargo
,
for
it
wo
n’t
do
to
let
my
men
into
the
scheme
.
<EOS>
My
next
trip
is
fixed
for
Poole
,
and
I
must
ostensibly
hold
to
the
arrangement
.
<EOS>
But
I
may
be
ready
in
a
couple
of
days
,
or
three
at
the
outside
,
if
that
will
do
.
”“It
<EOS>
must
do
,
captain
,
”
replied
Gunter
.
<EOS>
“
But
do
n’t
lose
any
time
.
<EOS>
My
friends
are
very
anxious
to
be
off
.
<EOS>
You
will
never
forgive
yourself
if
anything
should
happen
—
to
one
of
them
in
particular
—
in
consequence
of
the
delay
.
<EOS>
”“Shan’t
<EOS>
I
?
<EOS>
”
exclaimed
Tattersall
,
with
a
knowing
look
;
“
then
the
‘
one
in
particular
’
must
be
of
vast
interest
to
me
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
wo
n’t
make
any
further
inquiries
,
since
you
are
not
disposed
to
satisfy
me
.
<EOS>
Where
and
when
shall
we
meet
again?”Colonel
Gunter
consulted
Clavering
by
a
look
.
<EOS>
“Let
<EOS>
the
meeting
take
place
at
my
father
’s
house
,
at
Ovingdean
Grange
,
on
the
evening
of
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
,
”
said
young
Maunsel
.
<EOS>
“Good
,
”
replied
the
skipper
.
<EOS>
“
I
know
the
Grange
well
,
I
often
go
to
Rottingdean
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
glad
to
see
your
worthy
father
,
Colonel
Maunsel
,
for
whom
I
have
a
high
respect
.
<EOS>
I
was
sorry
to
hear
he
had
got
into
some
trouble
of
late
.
<EOS>
I
was
told
he
had
been
taken
to
Lewes
Castle
.
<EOS>
”“Your
<EOS>
information
is
not
exactly
correct
,
captain
,
”
<EOS>
Clavering
replied
.
<EOS>
“
Our
chaplain
,
Mr.
Beard
,
the
deprived
pastor
of
Ovingdean
,
and
his
daughter
,
were
taken
in
his
stead
,
my
father
being
nearly
at
death
’s
door
when
the
Ironside
leader
,
Stelfax
,
came
to
make
him
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
On
his
recovery
,
about
a
week
ago
,
the
colonel
went
to
Lewes
to
surrender
himself
and
obtain
the
release
of
his
hostages
,
and
met
with
better
treatment
than
he
anticipated
:
not
only
did
he
procure
the
liberation
of
Mr.
Beard
and
his
daughter
,
but
he
was
allowed
to
remain
a
prisoner
on
parole
at
Ovingdean
,
where
all
three
now
are
.
<EOS>
”“I
am
glad
to
hear
it
,
”
said
Tattersall
.
<EOS>
“
If
all
goes
well
,
on
the
afternoon
of
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
—
that
is
to
say
on
Wednesday
,
it
being
now
Monday
—
about
five
o’clock
,
I
will
be
at
Ovingdean
Grange
.
<EOS>
If
anything
should
prevent
my
coming
,
I
will
send
.
<EOS>
But
your
friends
may
hold
themselves
prepared
to
start
.
<EOS>
I
will
get
all
ready
—
if
I
can

<EOS>
”“You
clog
your
promises
with
so
many
doubts
,
captain

observed
Colonel
Gunter
,
“
that
you
also
must
make
me
fear
their
fulfilment

<EOS>
However
,
I
will
hope
for
the
best
.
<EOS>
At
five
o’clock
on
Wednesday
next
I
shall
expect
to
see
you
at
Ovingdean
Grange
,
and
my
friends
must
then
abide
your
scrutiny

<EOS>
”“And
if
Captain
Tattersall
,
when
he
does
see
them

be
not
delighted

lend
them
aid

he

not
the
man

take
him
for

said
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“Well
<EOS>
,
we
shall
see
,
”
replied
the
skipper
,
rising
.
<EOS>
“
Since
time
presses
,
I
will
go
and
see
about
getting
in
my
cargo
at
once
.
<EOS>
”“Stay
,
Tattersall
,
”
cried
Clavering
,
filling
the
skipper
’s
glass
.
<EOS>
“
One
toast
ere
you
go
;
I
’m
sure
you
wo

refuse
it

May
the

<EOS>
cried
the
skipper
,
emptying
the
glass
;
“

,
”
he
added
,
significantly
,
“
if
I
can
help
him
to
it
,
I
will
.
<EOS>
What
was
that
noise
?
<EOS>
I
thought
I
heard
some
one
suddenly
start
up
in
the
next
room
.
<EOS>
”“Very
<EOS>
likely
,
”
replied
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“
The
room
is
occupied
by
an
Independent
minister
,
lately
of
Ovingdean
.
<EOS>
But
he
could
n’t
overhear
us
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
hope
not

”
replied
Tattersall
.
<EOS>
“
I
hate
the
Independents

<EOS>
Adieu

gentlemen
.
<EOS>
On
Wednesday
,
at
five
.
<EOS>
”“Till
<EOS>
then
adieu
,
captain

said
Gunter
.
<EOS>
“
And
harkye
,
do
n’t
mention
a
word

has
passed

one

<EOS>
”“No
<EOS>
fear
of
my
blabbing
,
colonel
<EOS>
,
”
replied
Tattersall
.
<EOS>
And
he
quitted
the
room
.
<EOS>
Clavering
went
out
immediately
after
him
,
and
found
that
the
door
of
the
adjoining
room
was
open
,
and
the
apartment
vacant
.
<EOS>
Micklegift
,
if
he
had
been
there
,
was
gone
.
<EOS>
The
two
gentlemen
did
not
remain
much
longer
at
the
Dolphin
but
paid
their
reckoning
and
called
for
their
horses
,
which
were
soon
brought
out
by
John
Habergeon
.
<EOS>
They
then
rode
through
Old
Shoreham
,
and
kept
along
the
Bramber
road
,
on
the
banks
of
the
Arun
,
until
they
reached
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
Here
they
dismissed
John
Habergeon
,
who
was
directed
by
Clavering
to
pay
a
secret
visit
that
night
to
Ovingdean
Grange
,
and
acquaint
his
father
that
all
had
been
satisfactorily
arranged
,
and
that
he
and
his
friends
might
be
expected
on
Wednesday
afternoon
.
<EOS>
Charged
with
this
message
,
of
the
importance
of
which
,
insignificant
as
it
sounded
,
he
was
well
aware
,
the
old
trooper
rode
up
the
acclivities
on
the
right
of
the
valley
,
and
soon
disappeared
.
<EOS>
Having
crossed
the
bridge
,
the
two
gentlemen
pursued
the
high
road
to
Chichester
,
and
reached
Racton
late
in
the
day
,
without
misadventure

their
return
to
Racton
that
night
,
Colonel
Gunter
and
his
guest
partook
of
supper
,
and
were
still
seated
over
a
flask
of
excellent
Bordeaux
,
when
a
confidential
servant
entered
,
and
informed
his
master
that
the
messenger
had
just
arrived
,
and
craved
admittance
.
<EOS>
The
colonel
looked
surprised
,
but
bade
the
man
show
the
messenger
in
without
delay
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
the
servant
withdrew
,
and
presently
afterwards
reappeared
with
Ninian
Saxby
.
<EOS>
The
young
falconer
had
doffed
the
gay
and
becoming
habiliments
in
which
he
appeared
during
the
time
of
his
service
with
Colonel
Maunsel
,
and
was
now
very
soberly
clad
in
a
tight
-
fitting
jerkin
of
black
cloth
,
a
long
black
cloak
without
plait
or
ornament
,
funnel
-
topped
boots
armed
with
large
spurs
,
a
small
plain
band
,
and
a
steeple
-
crowned
hat
.
<EOS>
By
his
side
he
wore
a
long
tuck
—
a
weapon
proper
to
the
fanatical
party
to
which
he
was
now
supposed
to
belong
.
<EOS>
His
brown
curling
locks
,
once
his
ornament
and
pride
,
no
longer
offended
the
severe
eye
of
the
zealot
.
<EOS>
Shears
,
remorseless
as
those
of
Atropos
,
had
cropped
them
off
close
to
his
head
;
rendering
him
,
in
Cavalier
parlance
,
“
a
prick
-
eared
cur
.
”
<EOS>
But
the
merry
eye
,
laughing
features
,
and
careless
bearing
of
the
young
man
somewhat
belied
his
puritanical
attire
;
though
,
no
doubt
,
he
could
assume
a
more
sedate
look
and
deportment
when
occasion
required
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Gunter
waited
till
the
servant
had
retired
,
and
then
asked
Ninian
whence
<EOS>
he
came?“From
Hambledon
,
in
Hampshire
,
”
was
the
answer
.
<EOS>
“Where
does
the
king
lodge
to
-
night
?
”
demanded
Colonel
Gunter
.
<EOS>
“
Tarries
he
still
at
Hele
House
,
near
Amesbury
,
where
my
worthy
cousin
Hyde
has
been
fortunate
enough
to
afford
him
an
asylum?”“No
,
your
honour
,
”
Ninian
replied
.
<EOS>
“
His
Majesty
quitted
Hele
House
this
morning
,
after
remaining
there
for
three
or
four
days
,
and
came
on
to
Hambledon
,
on
his
way
into
Sussex
.
<EOS>
He
and
the
noble
Lord
Wilmot
will
pass
the
night
at
the
house
of
worshipful
Master
Symons
,
who
,
as
I
believe
,
married
your
honour
’s
sister
;
though
,
as
far
as
I
can
guess
,
the
lady
only
,
and
not
her
husband
,
will
be
made
acquainted
with
the
rank
of
her
guests
.
<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
quite
right
too
,
”
cried
Colonel
Gunter
,
with
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
“
<EOS>
Tom
Symons
,
though
a
worthy
fellow
,
is
too
fond
of
the
bottle
to
be
trusted
in
a
matter
of
such
vital
consequence
.
<EOS>
But
my
sister
,
though
I
say
it
,
is
a
woman
in
a
thousand
,
and
entire
reliance
may
be
placed
upon
her
judgment
and
discretion
.
<EOS>
But
hast
thou
nothing
for
me?”“This
little
ball
,
your
honour
,
which
I
should
have
swallowed
if
I
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
Philistines
,
”
Ninian
replied
.
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
produced
a
small
paper
bullet
,
and
handed
it
with
the
points
of
his
fingers
to
Colonel
Gunter
,
who
,
having
unfolded
the
tightly
-
compressed
sheet
of
tissue
paper
,
and
carefully
smoothed
its
creases
,
soon
made
himself
master
of
the
contents
of
the
letter
,
which
then
became
apparent
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
he
crushed
the
dispatch
in
his
hand
,
and
tossed
it
into
the
wood
fire
blazing
cheerily
on
the
hearth
,
where
it
was
instantly
consumed
.
<EOS>
“Lord
Wilmot
writes
that
his
Majesty
is
eager
to
embark
,
”
the
colonel
observed
to
Clavering
,
“
and
fully
calculating
upon
our
success
in
hiring
Tattersall
’s
brig
,
proposes
to
go
on
board
tomorrow
night
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
assigns
no
reason
for
thus
advancing
the
hour
of
departure
;
but
the
king
may
,
perhaps
,
have
taken
alarm
at
some
movement
of
the
enemy
,
or
it
may
only
be
a
natural
anxiety
on
his
Majesty
’s
part
to
get
out
of
harm
<EOS>
’s
way
.
<EOS>
Was
aught
said
on
the
subject
to
thee
,
<EOS>
Ninian?”“His
<EOS>
lordship
told
me
that
the
king
desires
most
ardently
to
embark
to
-
morrow
night
,
”
replied
Ninian
,
“
or
early
in
the
morning
,
as
his
Majesty
entertains
the
notion
that
the
moment
will
be
propitious
for
his
escape
,
and
that
,
if
deferred
,
ill
consequences
may
ensue
.
<EOS>
”“But
<EOS>
how
are
we
to
carry
out
the
king
’s
wishes
?
”
<EOS>
cried
Gunter
.
<EOS>
“
We
have
arranged
with
Tattersall
for
Wednesday
night
,
not
Wednesday
morning
,
and
it
will
be
scarcely
possible
,
I
fear
,
to
prevail
upon
the
stubborn
skipper
to
set
sail
earlier
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
the
rascal
stipulated
for
an
interview
with
his
two
passengers
before
he
would
agree
to
convey
them
across
the
Channel
.
”“True
,
”
replied
Clavering
;
“
but
Tattersall
is
a
loyal
fellow
,
and
I
believe
him
to
be
only
desirous
of
satisfying
himself
that
it
is
the
king
who
is
to
sail
with
him
.
<EOS>
Had
he
been
trusted
,
in
my
opinion
he
would
not
have
made
the
stipulation
;
but
you
did
not
deem
such
a
course
prudent
.
<EOS>
”“I
judged
it
better
not
to
tell
him
too
much
,
”
replied
Gunter
.
<EOS>
“
Not
that
I
believe
for
a
moment
that
the
reward
offered
by
the
Council
of
state
would
tempt
him
to
betray
the
king
.
<EOS>
He
is
too
loyal
and
honest
for
such
a
detestable
act
.
<EOS>
But
when
the
penalties
of
high
treason
stare
him
in
the
face
—
when
loss
of
life
and
confiscation
of
property
may
follow
his
complicity
in
a
scheme
like
the
present
—
I
feel
unwilling
to
alarm
him
,
lest
he
may
decline
altogether
.
<EOS>
”“I
have
no
fear
of
him
,
”
cried
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“
Animated
by
the
same
spirit
of
loyalty
as
ourselves
,
he
will
run
all
risks
to
save
his
sovereign
.
<EOS>
Should
we
hesitate
if
placed
in
a
similar
situation
?
<EOS>
Would
the
fear
of
death
affright
us
?
<EOS>
Assuredly
not
.
<EOS>
We
should
rather
rejoice
in
the
opportunity
afforded
of
proving
our
loyalty
and
devotion
.
<EOS>
Such
I
firmly
believe
to
be
<EOS>
Tattersall
’s
sentiments
.
<EOS>
But
come
what
may
,
he
must
be
ready
to
take
his
Majesty
and
Lord
Wilmot
on
board
to
-
morrow
night
,
and
to
set
sail
on
the
following
day
.
<EOS>
”“I
will
engage
that
Captain
Tattersall
shall
be
ready
,
if
your
honours
choose
to
confide
in
me
,
”
said
Ninian
.
<EOS>
“Thou
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
both
his
auditors
.
<EOS>
“Yes
,
I
,
”
the
young
falconer
replied
;
“
and
that
without
further
compromising
his
Majesty
than
has
been
done
at
present
.
<EOS>
I
will
ride
over
to
Shoreham
to-
night
,
see
Captain
Tattersall
early
in
the
morning
,
and
make
all
straight
with
him
.
<EOS>
The
Swiftsure
shall
be
ready
to
receive
her
royal
passenger
at
midnight
to-
morrow
,
and
to
sail
ere
daybreak
.
”“Accomplish
<EOS>
this
,
and
thou
wilt
earn
a
title
to
thy
sovereign
’s
gratitude
,
”
said
Colonel
Gunter
.
<EOS>
“
In
any
case
,
thou
mayst
rest
assured
of
a
good
reward
from
me
.
<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
from
me
also
,
”
said
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“
<EOS>
Hark
thee
,
Ninian
,
so
soon
as
thou
hast
arranged
matters
with
Tattersall
,
ride
on
to
the
Grange
,
and
acquaint
my
father
with
the
change
of
plans
.
<EOS>
John
Habergeon
will
have
led
him
to
expect
us
on
Wednesday
afternoon
.
<EOS>
”“Your
<EOS>
commands
shall
be
obeyed
,
”
replied
Ninian
,
turning
to
depart
.
<EOS>
“Stay
!
”
exclaimed
Colonel
Gunter
;
“
thou
hast
not
yet
told
us
where
we
are
to
meet
Lord
Wilmot
and
his
Majesty
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
”“I
thought
his
lordship
’s
letter
might
have
mentioned
the
place
of
rendezvous
,
”
replied
Ninian
.
<EOS>
“
At
five
o’clock
in
the
morning
,
the
king
and
his
escort
will
leave
Mr.
Symons
’s
house
,
near
Hambledon
,
and
your
honour
and
Captain
Clavering
are
to
meet
them
,
an
hour
later
,
in
the
central
avenue
of
Stanstead
Forest
.
”“It
<EOS>
is
well
,
”
said
Colonel
Gunter
.
<EOS>
“
We
must
be
astir
betimes
,
Clavering
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
Ninian
,
I
will
not
detain
thee
longer
than
shall
enable
thee
to
drink
a
bumper
of
canary
to
his
Majesty
’s
prosperous
voyage
across
the
Channel
.
<EOS>
”So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
filled
a
goblet
with
wine
,
and
gave
it
to
the
young
falconer
,
who
did
justice
to
the
pledge
proposed
to
him
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Gunter
then
inquired
from
Ninian
whether
his
horse
was
fully
equal
to
the
journey
he
had
to
perform
,
and
being
answered
in
the
affirmative
,
he
bade
the
young
man
good
night
,
enjoining
him
to
act
with
the
utmost
caution
,
since
much
now
depended
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Ninian
,
with
much
earnestness
,
and
more
modesty
than
he
usually
exhibited
,
replied
that
he
felt
the
full
responsibility
of
the
task
he
had
undertaken
,
and
would
discharge
it
to
the
best
of
his
ability
.
<EOS>
He
then
took
his
departure
,
and
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
started
for
Shoreham
.
<EOS>
Not
long
afterwards
the
two
Cavaliers
,
having
to
rise
early
,
with
the
prospect
of
a
hard
day
’s
work
to
follow
,
retired
to
rest
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IIA
Royal
WandererFIVE
o’clock
had
not
struck
next
morning
,
when
Colonel
Gunter
entered
Clavering
’s
chamber
,
and
found
his
guest
not
only
awake
,
but
fully
attired
and
prepared
for
the
journey
.
<EOS>
So
blithe
were
the
young
man
’s
looks
,
that
Colonel
Gunter
could
not
help
commenting
upon
them
,
and
said
,
“
I
am
glad
to
see
you
look
so
cheerful
,
my
young
friend
.
<EOS>
It
shows
that
you
calculate
on
success
,
and
I
doubt
not
your
anticipations
will
be
realized
.
<EOS>
”“Ere
many
hours
have
flown
,
his
Majesty
,
I
hope
,
will
have
quitted
these
ungrateful
shores
,
”
said
Clavering
;
“
<EOS>
and
I
feel
assured
that
although
he
is
now
driven
hence
by
the
malice
of
rebels
and
fanatics
,
he
will
return
to
his
kingdom
in
triumph
.
”“Amen
!
”
<EOS>
replied
Colonel
Gunter
.
<EOS>
“
Like
myself
,
I
see
you
are
well
armed
<EOS>
—
pistols
in
your
belt
and
rapier
by
your
side
.
<EOS>
I
trust
we
shall
have
no
occasion
to
use
our
weapons
.
<EOS>
But
the
king
shall
never
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
rebels
while
we
have
breath
to
defend
him
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
since
you
are
ready
,
let
us
set
forth
at
once
.
<EOS>
”“With
<EOS>
all
my
heart
,
”
replied
Clavering
;
“
I
am
impatient
to
greet
his
Majesty
on
the
day
which
I
trust
<EOS>
will
be
that
of
his
happy
deliverance
.
<EOS>
”None
of
the
household
were
astir
at
this
early
hour
except
the
confidential
servant
who
had
waited
upon
his
master
on
the
previous
evening
.
<EOS>
Their
attentive
personage
had
prepared
a
slight
repast
for
them
,
and
set
it
out
in
the
library
,
but
neither
of
the
gentlemen
cared
to
partake
of
it
,
nor
would
they
be
prevailed
upon
to
fortify
their
stomachs
against
the
morning
air
by
a
glass
of
strong
waters
,
at
the
butler
’s
recommendation
.
<EOS>
Proceeding
at
once
to
the
stables
,
they
mounted
their
steeds
,
which
they
found
in
readiness
,
and
rode
off
.
<EOS>
Racton
,
Colonel
Gunter
<EOS>
’s
residence
,
it
has
already
been
mentioned
,
was
about
four
miles
to
the
north
-
west
of
Chichester
,
and
though
a
house
of
no
great
size
or
pretension
,
was
very
pleasantly
situated
at
a
short
distance
from
Stanstead
Park
,
then
belonging
to
Lord
Lumley
.
<EOS>
This
park
,
with
the
stately
mansion
in
the
midst
of
it
,
now
lay
before
our
friends
;
they
did
not
,
however
,
enter
it
,
but
skirting
the
moss
-
grown
palings
by
which
it
was
surrounded
,
shaped
their
course
towards
the
forest
,
which
lay
further
to
the
west
.
<EOS>
As
the
sun
had
not
yet
appeared
to
enliven
nature
with
his
kindling
beams
,
and
dispel
the
mists
of
night
,
which
still
hung
heavy
over
the
woods
and
the
landscape
,
the
atmosphere
felt
excessively
cold
,
causing
the
two
gentlemen
to
draw
their
ample
cloaks
somewhat
more
tightly
round
them
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
,
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
,
the
middle
of
October
,
and
the
foliage
was
dyed
with
the
glowing
tints
bestowed
by
the
later
days
of
autumn
.
<EOS>
Heavy
dews
hung
on
the
leaves
,
and
the
ferns
,
briars
,
and
gorse
growing
on
the
roadside
were
plentifully
charged
with
moisture
.
<EOS>
The
horses
snorted
frequently
and
loudly
as
their
riders
walked
them
along
,
and
the
breath
from
the
animal
’s
nostrils
arose
like
steam
.
<EOS>
The
rabbits
on
the
sandy
banks
scudded
off
to
their
holes
on
the
approach
of
the
horsemen
.
<EOS>
The
pheasant
ran
along
the
ground
,
thickly
strewn
with
brown
leaves
,
and
gained
the
shelter
of
the
copse
.
<EOS>
The
blackbird
started
from
the
holly
-
bush
,
and
the
cries
of
the
jay
,
the
mellow
notes
of
the
wood
-
pigeon
,
and
the
chatter
of
the
magpie
resounded
from
the
thicket
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
the
two
Cavaliers
gained
the
forest
,
which
was
of
considerable
extent
,
and
boasted
some
noble
timber
,
being
especially
rich
,
like
most
large
woods
in
this
part
of
Sussex
,
in
beech
-
trees
.
<EOS>
Passing
a
grove
of
these
magnificent
trees
,
crowning
a
sandy
eminence
from
which
their
mighty
roots
protruded
,
our
friends
began
to
descend
a
long
sweeping
glade
,
broken
here
and
there
by
scattered
trees
—
ancient
oaks
with
gnarled
trunks
and
giant
arms
,
towering
elms
,
or
venerable
thorns
.
<EOS>
In
a
ferny
brake
on
the
right
was
couched
a
herd
of
deer
,
and
as
the
two
horsemen
neared
them
,
these
graceful
denizens
of
the
forest
started
up
from
their
bed
,
and
tripped
across
the
glade
.
<EOS>
A
little
further
on
,
the
deep
secluded
character
of
the
forest
in
some
measure
disappeared
,
though
the
scene
lost
nothing
of
its
picturesqueness
and
sylvan
beauty
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
sun
had
begun
to
o’er
-
top
the
trees
on
the
east
,
and
to
light
up
the
groves
on
the
western
side
of
the
glade
,
chequering
the
open
sward
with
shadows
,
though
the
opposite
side
was
still
buried
in
gloom
.
<EOS>
Riding
quickly
on
,
the
two
Cavaliers
speedily
reached
the
central
avenue
in
the
forest
—
a
wide
alley
two
miles
in
length
,
and
skirted
by
noble
trees
—
and
they
had
no
sooner
entered
it
than
they
descried
a
little
cavalcade
advancing
from
the
opposite
direction
,
though
still
about
a
mile
off
.
<EOS>
“Yonder
comes
the
king
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Colonel
Gunter
.
<EOS>
“
We
are
not
a
minute
too
soon
,
after
all
.
<EOS>
Forward
!
<EOS>
my
young
friend
—
forward
!
”
<EOS>
And
as
he
spoke
he
urged
on
his
steed
,
while
Clavering
likewise
quickened
his
pace
.
<EOS>
The
cavalcade
descried
by
our
friends
consisted
of
four
persons
,
all
well
mounted
,
and
all
plainly
attired
in
sad
-
coloured
garments
—
long
black
cloaks
,
square
-
toed
boots
drawn
above
the
knee
,
and
hats
with
tall
conical
crowns
and
broad
penthouse
brims
.
<EOS>
They
might
have
been
taken
for
demure
and
fanatical
Republicans
.
<EOS>
The
two
gentlemen
in
advance
were
Colonel
Robert
Philips
,
of
Montacute
House
,
in
Somersetshire
,
a
devoted
Royalist
,
and
Captain
Thomas
Gunter
,
our
worthy
colonel
’s
kinsman
.
<EOS>
Of
the
pair
who
came
behind
,
he
who
rode
on
the
left
was
Lord
Wilmot
;
but
it
is
the
individual
on
the
right
who
claims
our
chief
attention
.
<EOS>
Tall
of
stature
,
and
,
so
far
as
could
be
judged
in
his
unbecoming
attire
,
strongly
and
well
proportioned
,
this
personage
possessed
features
which
could
scarcely
be
termed
handsome
.
<EOS>
And
yet
,
though
the
countenance
might
be
somewhat
harsh
,
the
eyes
were
so
large
,
quick
,
and
expressive
,
so
full
of
fire
and
intelligence
,
of
malice
<EOS>
and
,
it
might
be
,
merriment
,
that
it
was
difficult
to
say
that
he
was
ill
-
looking
.
<EOS>
The
owner
of
that
remarkable
physiognomy
used
himself
to
describe
it
as
ugly
,
but
it
may
be
doubted
whether
any
one
else
concurred
with
him
in
opinion
.
<EOS>
The
features
,
though
large
,
and
perhaps
a
little
coarse
,
were
by
no
means
heavy
,
but
susceptible
of
the
most
captivating
,
vivacious
,
and
humorous
expression
.
<EOS>
Drollery
,
indeed
,
and
good
humour
might
be
said
to
characterize
the
face
,
though
there
was
a
strong
touch
of
sarcasm
about
the
mouth
.
<EOS>
The
complexion
of
the
person
under
consideration
was
singularly
swarthy
,
his
eyebrows
thick
and
black
,
and
the
little
that
could
be
seen
of
his
close
-
cropped
hair
,
of
the
same
raven
hue
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
fugitive
monarch
,
Charles
Stuart
,
as
he
appeared
to
the
two
Cavaliers
when
they
rode
forward
to
salute
him
.
<EOS>
As
our
friends
came
within
a
bow
-
shot
of
the
king
,
he
ordered
a
halt
,
and
stood
still
to
await
their
approach
—
his
attendants
drawing
back
so
as
to
leave
his
Majesty
in
front
.
<EOS>
On
seeing
the
little
cortége
halt
in
this
manner
,
the
two
Cavaliers
slackened
their
pace
,
approaching
the
royal
wanderer
as
ceremoniously
and
with
as
profound
respect
as
if
he
had
been
surrounded
by
a
large
retinue
,
and
aided
and
accompanied
by
all
the
pomp
and
show
of
princely
state
.
<EOS>
When
within
a
short
distance
of
the
king
,
they
both
drew
up
,
and
,
uncovering
,
bowed
to
the
saddle
-
bow
.
<EOS>
Charles
returned
their
salutation
with
the
dignity
and
grace
peculiar
to
him
.
<EOS>
His
whole
deportment
was
changed
,
and
notwithstanding
his
sorry
attire
,
he
now
looked
every
inch
a
king
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
more
affable
and
condescending
than
his
manner
,
while
the
air
of
majesty
which
he
ceased
not
to
retain
,
heightened
the
effect
of
his
gracious
demeanour
.
<EOS>
“Well
met
,
gentlemen
!
”
<EOS>
he
cried
.
<EOS>
“
A
good
morning
to
both
of
you
.
<EOS>
Delighted
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
Approach
,
Mr.
Clavering
Maunsel
.
<EOS>
We
have
not
seen
you
since
the
night
after
Worcester
’s
luckless
engagement
,
when
,
at
great
personal
risk
,
you
delivered
us
from
imminent
capture
by
the
rebels
.
<EOS>
Approach
,
brave
young
sir
,
that
we
may
tender
our
thanks
for
the
service
,
which
,
rest
assured
,
will
never
be
obliterated
from
our
memory
.
<EOS>
”At
<EOS>
this
intimation
,
Clavering
sprang
from
his
steed
,
and
giving
the
bridle
to
Colonel
Gunter
,
stepped
forward
,
and
bending
the
knee
reverentially
before
the
young
monarch
,
kissed
the
hand
which
the
latter
extended
towards
him
.
<EOS>
“Rise
,
sir
,
”
said
Charles
.
<EOS>
“
We
are
greatly
beholden
to
you
,
but
you
must
content
yourself
with
bare
thanks
for
the
present
,
our
fallen
estate
not
permitting
us
the
means
of
adequately
rewarding
services
like
yours
.
<EOS>
But
a
day
may
come
,
and
then
they
shall
not
be
forgotten
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
what
tidings
do
you
bring
of
your
worthy
father?—he
<EOS>
is
well
<EOS>
,
I
trust
?
<EOS>
And
the
valiant
old
trooper
who
fought
with
him
at
Edge
Hill
and
Naseby
,
and
whom
he
sent
with
you
to
Worcester
<EOS>
—
how
is
he
named?—let
<EOS>
me
see
—
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
John
Habergeon
<EOS>
—
how
fares
it
with
the
tough
old
fellow
?
<EOS>
I
trust
no
prick
-
eared
fanatic
has
shortened
his
days
?
<EOS>
We
shall
put
Colonel
Maunsel
’s
loyalty
and
hospitality
to
the
proof
,
for
we
propose
to
pass
a
few
hours
with
him
at
Ovingdean
Grange
before
proceeding
to
Shoreham
.
<EOS>
The
visit
,
we
trust
,
can
be
made
without
risk
?
<EOS>
But
these
questions
,
and
others
which
we
design
to
put
to
you
,
can
be
answered
more
leisurely
as
we
ride
along
.
<EOS>
So
mount
,
young
sir
,
and
take
a
place
beside
us
.
<EOS>
”And
<EOS>
while
Clavering
hastened
to
obey
his
Majesty
’s
behest
,
Charles
accorded
an
equally
gracious
reception
to
Colonel
Gunter
;
with
this
difference
only
,
that
he
allowed
the
latter
to
perform
the
ceremony
of
kissing
hands
without
quitting
the
saddle
.
<EOS>
The
cavalcade
was
now
once
more
in
motion
,
and
proceeding
at
a
trot
along
the
avenue
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Philips
and
Captain
Gunter
rode
in
advance
as
before
,
while
the
rear
was
brought
up
by
Colonel
Gunter
and
Lord
Wilmot
,
the
king
and
Clavering
occupying
the
centre
.
<EOS>
After
a
little
preliminary
discourse
,
Charles
broached
the
subject
of
greatest
interest
to
himself
,
and
inquired
,
with
an
anxiety
which
he
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
,
whether
Tattersall
’s
vessel
was
engaged
,
and
ready
to
sail
that
night
,
or
early
in
the
morning?“The
brig
is
secured
,
as
I
trust
,
sire
,
”
Clavering
replied
;
“
but
arrangements
were
made
for
to
-
morrow
night
,
not
for
the
morning
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
do
not
believe
that
the
earlier
hour
will
make
much
difference
to
Captain
Tattersall
;
and
our
faithful
messenger
Ninian
Saxby
,
has
already
been
dispatched
to
him
to
expedite
matters
.
”“Tattersall
<EOS>
must
start
before
daybreak
to
-
morrow
morning
,
”
said
Charles
.
<EOS>
“
I
am
superstitious
enough
to
attach
great
importance
to
the
arrangement
,
and
feel
persuaded
that
delay
will
be
fraught
with
danger
.
”“Heaven
<EOS>
forfend
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“
I
would
we
had
been
sooner
aware
of
your
Majesty
’s
<EOS>
wishes
in
this
particular
.
<EOS>
”“That
could
not
easily
be
<EOS>
,
”
replied
the
king
.
<EOS>
“
Till
yesterday
I
was
indifferent
to
the
matter
,
but
now
I
am
bent
upon
it
.
<EOS>
”“Far
be
it
from
me
to
attempt
to
shake
your
Majesty
’s
resolution
,
”
said
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“
You
would
not
,
I
am
sure
,
feel
so
strong
a
conviction
without
cause
.
<EOS>
And
perhaps
this
acceleration
of
your
plans
may
save
you
from
some
secret
danger
.
<EOS>
”As
<EOS>
he
spoke
,
his
thoughts
involuntarily
reverted
to
Micklegift
,
but
he
did
not
think
it
needful
to
mention
his
misgivings
to
the
king
.
<EOS>
“
I
had
previously
prepared
my
father
for
the
honour
and
gratification
he
might
expect
in
a
visit
from
your
Majesty
tomorrow
;
but
his
impatience
will
be
so
great
that
he
will
be
far
better
pleased
that
it
should
occur
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
hope
we
shall
take
him
by
surprise
,
”
said
the
king
.
<EOS>
“
I
do
not
desire
him
to
make
any
preparations
.
<EOS>
I
must
be
received
by
him
,
not
as
the
king
,
but
as
plain
William
Jackson
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
if
by
any
accident
the
expected
visit
of
to
-
morrow
should
have
reached
the
enemy
,
and
bring
them
to
the
house
,
they
will
be
a
day
too
late
.
”“True
,
”
replied
Clavering
,
thoughtfully
.
<EOS>
“
All
things
considered
,
I
am
not
sorry
that
your
Majesty
has
advanced
the
hour
of
your
departure
.
<EOS>
”At
<EOS>
this
juncture
<EOS>
an
opening
in
the
trees
displayed
a
fine
view
of
the
country
,
the
prospect
being
terminated
by
Portsmouth
,
with
its
shipping
,
and
the
Isle
of
Wight
.
<EOS>
The
king
stopped
to
gaze
at
the
scene
,
and
his
little
escort
halted
likewise
.
<EOS>
After
looking
for
a
few
moments
at
the
distant
arsenal
,
with
its
forts
,
docks
,
and
storehouses
,
he
exclaimed
,
in
tones
of
some
emotion
,
not
unmingled
with
bitterness
.
<EOS>
“Oh
,
that
yon
noble
arsenal
,
with
its
fortifications
and
stores
,
and
the
powerful
fleet
in
its
harbour
,
were
mine
!
<EOS>
I
should
not
need
more
to
regain
my
kingdom
.
<EOS>
But
all
have
fallen
from
me
except
you
,
my
faithful
followers
,
and
a
few
others
,
and
I
ought
,
therefore
,
to
estimate
your
loyalty
at
its
true
value
.
<EOS>
”After
<EOS>
a
brief
pause
he
continued
,
in
a
voice
of
deep
emotion
,
“
Now
that
the
hour
is
almost
come
when
I
must
exile
myself
from
my
country
,
and
seek
shelter
on
a
foreign
shore
<EOS>
,
I
shrink
from
the
effort
,
and
almost
prefer
death
to
a
flight
,
which
has
something
cowardly
and
dishonourable
about
it
—
unworthy
of
the
descendant
of
a
royal
line
,
and
himself
a
king
.
<EOS>
”“View
<EOS>
not
your
withdrawal
in
that
light
,
my
gracious
liege
,
”
said
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“
There
is
nothing
unworthy
in
your
meditated
flight
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
it
is
a
course
of
action
dictated
by
prudence
.
<EOS>
If
a
chance
remained
of
regaining
your
kingdom
,
I
and
your
faithful
liegemen
would
urge
you
to
stay
.
<EOS>
But
the
moment
is
unpropitious
,
and
you
do
wisely
to
withdraw
till
this
terrible
tempest
now
passing
over
the
land
shall
have
exhausted
its
fury
.
<EOS>
Leave
your
misguided
and
ungrateful
subjects
for
a
while
to
the
care
of
the
usurper
Cromwell
—
they
will
soon
be
heartily
sick
of
him
,
and
eager
to
recally
ou
.
<EOS>
”“What
<EOS>
you
say
is
true
—
perfectly
true
,
”
replied
Charles
;
“
I
must
go
.
<EOS>
Yet
it
is
hard
to
fly
from
a
kingdom
,
even
when
it
is
mine
no
longer
.
<EOS>
”“Your
<EOS>
kingdom
is
not
lost
,
my
liege
,
”
cried
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“
You
design
not
to
abdicate
.
”“Never
!
”
exclaimed
Charles
.
<EOS>
“
I
will
sooner
mount
my
murdered
father
’s
<EOS>
scaffold
than
do
so
.
<EOS>
”“Then
<EOS>
I
am
right
in
saying
your
kingdom
is
not
lost
,
sire
.
<EOS>
A
king
is
not
the
less
a
king
because
he
can
only
rally
round
him
a
few
faithful
followers
,
Our
spirit
in
time
will
animate
others
,
and
will
catch
and
spread
till
the
whole
land
is
on
fire
.
<EOS>
Treason
and
rebellion
will
be
burned
out
,
and
your
subjects
eager
to
herald
your
return
.
<EOS>
”“I
trust
<EOS>
it
may
be
so
,
”
replied
the
king
.
<EOS>
“
Have
any
tidings
been
heard
of
the
Earl
of
Derby
?
<EOS>
A
court
-
martial
hath
sat
upon
him
,
as
I
am
informed
,
by
virtue
of
a
commission
from
the
arch
-
traitor
Cromwell
,
and
it
hath
,
in
violation
of
all
laws
of
honourable
warfare
,
since
quarter
was
promised
the
earl
on
surrender
,
condemned
him
to
death
by
the
headsman
.
<EOS>
But
his
lordship
hath
since
petitioned
Cromwell
,
as
I
am
told
,
for
a
remission
of
his
sentence
—
with
what
result?—can
any
of
ye
tell
me
,
<EOS>
gentlemen?”There
was
a
profound
silence
.
<EOS>
And
Clavering
and
Colonel
Gunter
,
on
whom
Charles
fixed
inquiring
glances
,
cast
down
their
eyes
.
<EOS>
“Your
silence
shows
me
that
the
petition
has
been
ineffectual
,
”
continued
the
king
.
<EOS>
“
Not
content
with
shedding
the
best
blood
of
England
,
the
murderous
villain
would
pour
out
more
.
<EOS>
He
would
spare
none
of
you
if
ye
fell
into
his
hands
.
<EOS>
O
my
valiant
and
chivalrous
Derby
,
thou
soul
of
honour
and
loyalty
,
and
art
thou
to
perish
thus
!
<EOS>
When
and
where
is
the
shameful
deed
to
be
done?”“To
-
morrow
at
noon
at
Bolton
,
in
Lancashire
,
as
I
am
informed
,
my
liege
,
”
replied
Clavering
,
to
whom
the
question
seemed
to
be
addressed
.
<EOS>
“To
<EOS>
-
morrow
at
noon
—
ha
!
”
exclaimed
Charles
,
sadly
.
<EOS>
“
Then
one
of
the
best
and
bravest
spirits
in
England
will
wing
its
flight
to
purer
spheres
!
<EOS>
Prepare
yourselves
to
be
astonished
,
gentlemen
,
by
what
I
am
about
to
relate
.
<EOS>
As
I
live
and
stand
before
you
,
”
he
added
,
in
a
tone
of
so
much
solemnity
that
it
struck
awe
in
his
hearers
,
“
I
have
been
warned
that
Derby
would
die
at
the
time
you
have
mentioned
.
<EOS>
”“May
<EOS>
I
venture
to
ask
your
Majesty
how
you
received
the
warning
?
”
<EOS>
said
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“From
the
earl
himself
<EOS>
,
”
replied
Charles
.
<EOS>
“
You
all
stare
and
look
incredulous
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
so
,
unless
I
have
conjured
up
a
phantom
from
mine
own
imagination
.
<EOS>
I
saw
him
the
night
before
last
at
midnight
—
I
saw
him
again
last
night
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
methought
I
beheld
his
shadowy
figure
,
not
long
ago
,
in
this
very
forest
.
<EOS>
”“Here
!
<EOS>
in
this
forest
,
sire
?
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“Moving
amidst
the
trees
by
my
side
,
”
replied
Charles
.
<EOS>
“
I
beheld
him
quite
plainly
,
though
I
mentioned
not
the
circumstance
.
<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
the
apparition
,
if
such
it
may
be
called
,
came
to
warn
your
Majesty
,
you
say
?
”
<EOS>
cried
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“The
earl
,
or
a
spirit
in
his
likeness
,
warned
me
,
”
replied
the
king
,
“
that
his
execution
would
take
place
to
-
morrow
—
the
truth
of
which
sad
intelligence
<EOS>
you
yourself
have
just
confirmed
—
and
the
semblance
of
my
gallant
Derby
added
,
that
if
I
quitted
not
England
before
his
head
was
laid
upon
the
block
,
I
should
share
the
same
fate
as
my
martyred
father
.
<EOS>
Hence
my
anxiety
to
set
sail
at
daybreak
<EOS>
to
-
morrow
will
be
intelligible
to
you
.
<EOS>
”“Your
<EOS>
haste
and
inquietude
are
now
perfectly
intelligible
,
sire
,
”
replied
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“The
circumstance
is
strange
,
and
inexplicable
even
to
myself
,
”
said
Charles
.
<EOS>
“
But
it
is
best
to
accept
such
matters
as
they
come
,
without
seeking
to
examine
them
too
closely
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
a
delusion
,
or
it
may
be
real
,
I
can
not
say
which
;
but
I
shall
act
as
if
the
warning
had
been
given
me
by
my
beloved
Derby
in
person
.
<EOS>
But
I
shall
grow
sad
if
I
suffer
my
thoughts
to
dwell
longer
on
this
theme
.
<EOS>
Let
us
on!”With
this
,
he
put
his
steed
once
more
in
motion
,
and
the
little
cavalcade
proceeded
in
the
same
order
and
at
the
same
pace
as
before
.
<EOS>
By
pursuing
the
avenue
to
its
full
extent
,
the
king
would
have
been
brought
nearer
Stanstead
House
than
his
conductors
judged
prudent
.
<EOS>
They
therefore
turned
off
on
the
left
,
and
soon
came
to
a
more
open
part
of
the
forest
,
where
the
timber
,
being
scattered
,
attained
larger
growth
.
<EOS>
Here
they
encountered
a
woodman
,
with
a
hatchet
over
his
shoulder
,
accompanied
by
a
lad
,
and
both
stood
still
to
gaze
at
the
cavalcade
;
but
on
recognizing
Colonel
Gunter
,
who
was
known
to
him
,
the
forester
doffed
his
fur
cap
and
went
his
way
.
<EOS>
Further
on
,
they
met
a
couple
of
huntsmen
in
Lord
Lumley
’s
livery
,
and
these
men
likewise
testified
surprise
on
beholding
the
party
.
<EOS>
But
again
Colonel
Gunter
’s
presence
prevented
interruption
.
<EOS>
After
quitting
the
forest
and
skirting
Stanstead
Park
,
the
royal
party
pursued
their
way
through
a
lovely
and
well
-
wooded
district
,
until
they
came
to
the
foot
of
an
eminence
called
Bow
Hill
,
and
entered
the
narrow
and
picturesque
vale
denominated
Kingly
Bottom
—
so
called
from
a
battle
between
the
inhabitants
of
Chichester
and
the
Danes
—
and
Charles
failed
not
to
notice
the
group
of
venerable
yew
-
trees
—
venerable
in
his
days
,
though
still
extant
,
with
the
trifle
of
two
centuries
added
to
their
age
—
that
adorn
the
valley
.
<EOS>
After
this
,
they
passed
Stoke
Down
,
bestowing
a
passing
observation
on
the
curious
circular
hollows
indented
in
the
sod
.
<EOS>
From
the
acclivities
over
which
the
travellers
next
rode
the
ancient
and
picturesque
city
of
Chichester
could
be
seen
on
the
level
land
near
the
sea
,
the
tall
spire
and
pinnacles
of
its
noble
cathedral
,
the
adjacent
bell
-
tower
,
and
the
quaint
old
octagonal
market
-
cross
,
erected
in
the
fifteenth
century
,
all
rising
above
the
crumbling
walls
still
surrounding
the
city
.
<EOS>
As
Charles
looked
towards
this
fine
old
cathedral
,
he
could
not
help
deploring
to
his
companions
the
damage
it
had
sustained
at
the
hands
of
the
sacrilegious
Republican
soldiers
.
<EOS>
Avoiding
Chichester
,
the
king
and
his
company
pursued
their
way
along
the
beautiful
and
well
-
wooded
slopes
of
the
Goodwood
downs
.
<EOS>
If
the
journey
had
been
unattended
with
risk
,
it
would
have
been
delightful
;
but
beset
by
peril
as
he
was
,
on
all
sides
,
Charles
did
not
lose
his
sense
of
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
The
constant
presence
of
danger
had
made
him
well
-
nigh
indifferent
to
it
.
<EOS>
Constitutionally
brave
,
almost
reckless
,
he
was
assailed
by
no
idle
apprehensions
.
<EOS>
The
chief
maxim
in
his
philosophy
was
to
make
the
most
of
the
passing
moment
,
and
not
to
let
the
chances
of
future
misfortune
damp
present
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
The
fineness
of
the
weather
contributed
materially
to
the
pleasure
of
the
ride
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
exquisite
morning
,
and
the
day
promised
to
continue
equally
beautiful
throughout
.
<EOS>
The
trees
were
clothed
with
the
glowing
livery
of
later
autumn
,
and
as
the
whole
district
was
well
and
variously
wooded
,
there
was
every
variety
of
shade
in
the
foliage
still
left
,
from
bright
yellow
to
deepest
red
.
<EOS>
Corn
was
then
,
as
now
,
extensively
grown
in
the
broad
and
fertile
fields
in
the
flat
land
nearer
the
sea
,
but
the
crops
had
been
gathered
,
and
the
fields
were
for
the
most
part
covered
with
stubble
.
<EOS>
The
prospect
offered
to
the
king
,
as
he
looked
towards
the
coast
,
was
varied
and
extensive
.
<EOS>
On
the
left
,
the
ancient
mansion
of
Halnaker
,
now
in
ruins
,
but
at
that
time
presenting
a
goodly
specimen
of
the
Tudor
era
of
architecture
,
seemed
to
invite
him
to
halt
;
and
Colonel
Gunter
informed
his
Majesty
that
over
the
buttery
hatch
in
this
old
house
were
scrolls
hospitably
entreating
visitors
to
“
come
in
and
drink
,
”
assuring
them
they
would
be
“
les
bien
-
venus
.
”
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
these
inducements
to
tarry
,
Charles
rode
on
,
galloping
along
the
fine
avenue
of
chestnut
-
trees
,
the
fallen
leaves
of
which
now
thickly
strewed
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Halnaker
was
soon
left
behind
,
and
ere
long
the
somewhat
devious
course
of
the
royal
party
led
them
through
the
exquisite
grove
of
beech
-
trees
skirting
Slindon
Park
,
the
remarkable
beauty
of
the
timber
eliciting
the
warm
admiration
of
the
king
,
who
would
fain
have
loitered
to
admire
it
at
his
leisure
.

CHAPTER
IIIAn
Encounter
With
The
Governor
Of
Arundel
<EOS>
CastleTHE
proud
-
looking
castle
of
Arundel
was
now
visible
,
magnificently
situated
on
the
terrace
of
a
hill
,
surrounded
by
noble
woods
,
above
which
towered
the
ancient
central
keep
.
<EOS>
From
the
spot
where
the
royal
party
surveyed
.
<EOS>
it
,
about
two
miles
off
,
the
stately
edifice
looked
the
picture
of
feudal
grandeur
,
but
a
nearer
approach
showed
how
grievously
it
had
been
injured
.
<EOS>
At
the
outbreak
of
the
Great
Rebellion
Arundel
Castle
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
Parliamentary
forces
,
but
surrendered
to
Lord
Hopton
in
1643
.
<EOS>
It
did
not
,
however
,
remain
long
in
the
possession
of
the
Royalists
,
being
retaken
within
two
months
,
after
a
siege
of
seventeen
days
,
by
Sir
William
Waller
,
when
a
thousand
prisoners
were
made
by
the
victorious
party
.
<EOS>
The
castle
was
then
plundered
and
partly
destroyed
,
and
great
ravages
committed
in
the
ancient
and
beautiful
church
of
Saint
Nicholas
,
contiguous
to
it
.
<EOS>
At
the
time
of
our
story
it
was
occupied
as
a
garrison
by
the
Parliamentary
troops
,
the
command
of
the
castle
,
with
the
title
of
governor
,
having
been
very
recently
accorded
to
Colonel
Morley
,
a
Republican
officer
of
great
strictness
and
severity
.
<EOS>
Though
the
interior
of
the
ancient
and
stately
fabric
was
mutilated
and
destroyed
,
though
the
carved
tombs
and
monuments
,
stone
pulpit
,
arches
,
altars
,
delicate
tracery
,
and
exquisite
architectural
ornaments
of
the
church
were
defaced
,
though
much
of
the
fine
timber
growing
near
the
fortress
was
remorselessly
hewn
down
,
the
defences
of
the
castle
were
still
maintained
,
and
it
was
even
then
looked
upon
as
a
place
of
considerable
strength
.
<EOS>
“I
was
with
Lord
Hopton
when
he
took
yon
fortress
in
‘
43
,
”
observed
Colonel
Gunter
to
the
king
.
<EOS>
“
The
rascals
surrendered
on
the
first
summons
,
and
saved
us
the
trouble
of
a
siege
.
<EOS>
But
it
cost
Waller
seventeen
days
of
good
hard
work
to
get
it
back
again
.
<EOS>
The
rogues
have
done
as
much
mischief
as
they
can
both
to
castle
and
church
.
<EOS>
We
must
,
perforce
,
pass
through
the
town
,
as
we
shall
to
cross
the
Arun
by
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
”Charles
made
no
objection
,
and
the
party
rode
on
until
they
reached
the
hill
on
which
the
proud
fortress
is
planted
.
<EOS>
They
were
mounting
the
ascent
somewhat
leisurely
,
when
the
merry
notes
of
a
hunting
-
horn
greeted
their
ears
,
and
the
next
moment
a
company
of
wellnigh
a
dozen
horsemen
,
with
a
pack
of
hounds
,
appeared
at
the
top
of
the
hill
.
<EOS>
From
the
buff
coats
,
boots
,
and
other
habiliments
worn
by
these
horsemen
,
it
was
evident
that
they
were
troopers
from
the
castle
going
forth
to
indulge
in
the
pastime
of
hunting
,
but
though
for
the
convenience
of
the
chase
they
had
laid
aside
their
swords
,
carabines
,
and
heavy
steel
accoutrements
,
they
had
still
bandoleers
over
their
shoulders
,
and
pistols
in
their
holsters
.
<EOS>
In
this
troop
one
person
was
a
little
in
advance
of
the
others
,
and
it
was
evident
from
the
superiority
of
his
attire
,
as
well
as
from
the
deference
shown
him
,
that
he
was
higher
in
station
than
his
companions
.
<EOS>
The
individual
in
question
was
no
other
than
the
newly
-
appointed
governor
of
Arundel
Castle
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Morley
was
a
tall
,
raw
-
boned
personage
,
with
broad
cheeks
and
flat
nose
,
and
the
truculence
of
his
looks
was
not
diminished
by
a
long
pair
of
starched
moustaches
,
which
projected
,
like
the
whiskers
of
a
tiger
,
from
his
face
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Gunter
instantly
recognised
him
,
and
informing
the
king
who
was
coming
towards
them
,
asked
if
his
Majesty
preferred
to
turn
aside?“On
no
account
,
”
replied
Charles
.
<EOS>
“
That
would
excite
instant
suspicion
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Morley
has
seen
us
.
<EOS>
Go
boldly
on
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
two
parties
now
rapidly
approached
each
other
.
<EOS>
The
Royalists
displayed
great
nerve
,
and
did
not
flinch
from
the
encounter
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Morley
eyed
the
troop
advancing
towards
him
sharply
and
suspiciously
.
<EOS>
He
allowed
them
to
approach
quite
close
without
question
,
but
just
as
they
were
about
to
pass
he
called
out
to
them
,
in
an
authoritative
tone
,
to
stay
.
<EOS>
“Who
are
ye
?
”
<EOS>
he
demanded
.
<EOS>
“
And
whither
go
ye?”“We
are
from
Chichester
,
worshipful
sir
,
of
which
city
I
am
mayor
,
”
replied
Colonel
Gunter
,
“
on
our
way
to
Steyning
,
to
attend
the
marriage
of
a
cousin
of
mine
,
a
very
comely
damsel
,
who
is
to
be
wedded
this
day
to
an
elder
of
that
town
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
governor
took
little
notice
of
the
reply
,
but
looking
fixedly
at
the
king
,
said:“Who
art
thou
,
friend
?
<EOS>
Thy
face
seems
familiar
to
me
.
<EOS>
”“Very
<EOS>
like
it
may
be
,
worshipful
sir
,
if
you
have
ever
visited
Chichester
,
”
replied
Charles
,
without
betraying
the
slightest
confusion
.
<EOS>
“
I
am
an
alderman
and
maltster
of
the
city
,
by
name
William
Jackson
.
<EOS>
You
have
heard
of
me
<EOS>
,
I
doubt
not?”“I
can
not
say
that
I
have
,
but
then
I
have
recently
arrived
here
,
”
replied
the
governor
of
the
castle
,
to
whom
the
answers
appeared
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
“
Pass
on
your
way
,
Mr.
Mayor
,
and
you
,
good
master
alderman
,
and
take
my
best
wishes
for
the
happiness
of
the
bride
,
especially
if
she
be
as
comely
as
ye
represent
her
.
<EOS>
And
harkye
,
one
of
my
men
shall
go
with
you
,
and
see
you
safely
through
the
town
,
or
,
peradventure
,
ye
may
be
hindered
.
<EOS>
Go
with
them
,
Corporal
Gird
-
the-
Loins
Grimbald
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
pretended
mayor
of
Chichester
thanked
the
governor
of
Arundel
Castle
for
his
courtesy
,
after
which
the
Royalist
party
,
attended
by
Corporal
Grimbald
,
a
very
grim
-
looking
corporal
indeed
,
set
off
in
one
direction
,
while
Colonel
Morley
,
winding
his
horn
to
call
the
hounds
together
,
rode
off
in
another
,
followed
by
the
troopers
.
<EOS>
The
royal
party
soon
afterwards
entered
Arundel
,
and
it
was
fortunate
that
they
had
the
grim
-
visaged
corporal
with
them
,
for
the
town
proved
to
be
full
of
soldiers
.
<EOS>
Many
of
these
glanced
inquisitively
at
the
travellers
,
but
,
seeing
Grimbald
,
concluded
all
must
be
right
.
<EOS>
A
nearer
inspection
of
the
castle
showed
the
extent
of
the
damage
done
to
it
by
the
Parliamentary
soldiers
.
<EOS>
Sentinels
fully
accoutred
,
and
armed
with
carabines
,
were
posted
at
the
gates
of
the
fortress
,
and
within
the
base
-
court
could
be
seen
other
men
drawn
up
,
and
going
through
their
exercise
.
<EOS>
Our
party
,
however
,
pushed
on
,
and
made
for
the
bridge
,
where
Corporal
Gird
-
the
-
Loins
Grimbald
quitted
them
.

CHAPTER
IVThe
Blacksmith
Of
AngmeringHAVING
crossed
the
narrow
but
rushing
Arun
,
the
travellers
now
pursued
their
way
along
a
winding
lane
,
bordered
in
many
places
by
fine
trees
,
and
enjoying
glimpses
of
delicious
woodland
scenery
.
<EOS>
As
they
approached
Angmering
,
it
was
discovered
that
the
king
’s
horse
had
lost
a
shoe
.
<EOS>
At
first
,
it
was
feared
that
the
loss
could
not
be
remedied
at
any
place
nearer
than
Steyning
,
but
luckily
a
little
smithy
was
found
on
the
skirts
of
Angmering
Park
,
while
a
small
wayside
inn
,
very
pleasantly
situated
in
the
midst
of
some
fine
elm
trees
,
offered
them
the
refreshment
they
so
much
needed
,
both
for
themselves
and
their
steeds
.
<EOS>
Since
quitting
Stanstead
Forest
they
had
now
ridden
upwards
of
twenty
miles
,
the
king
and
those
with
him
having
previously
ridden
ten
miles
from
Hambledon
.
<EOS>
All
the
party
were
as
hungry
as
hunters
.
<EOS>
Charles
declared
he
felt
absolutely
voracious
,
and
directed
Colonel
Gunter
to
order
the
best
breakfast
that
could
be
provided
at
the
little
inn
,
while
he
himself
got
his
horse
shod
.
<EOS>
The
blacksmith
,
a
shrewd
-
looking
fellow
,
lifted
up
the
horse
’s
feet
deliberately
,
and
then
,
with
rather
a
singular
look
,
remarked,“Why
,
master
,
how
comes
this
?
<EOS>
Your
horse
has
but
three
shoes
left
,
and
all
three
were
put
on
in
different
counties
;
and
one
in
Worcestershire
.
<EOS>
”“You
are
right
,
friend
,
”
replied
Charles
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
“
This
horse
was
ridden
at
the
fight
at
Worcester
.
<EOS>
I
bought
him
from
a
disbanded
Cavalier
.
<EOS>
”“Well
,
he
shall
have
an
honest
Roundhead
shoe
this
time
,
I
can
promise
you
,
master
,
”
cried
the
blacksmith
,
plying
his
bellows
,
and
soon
afterwards
placing
a
glowing
shoe
on
the
anvil
.
<EOS>
“
I
should
like
to
belabour
all
Royalists
in
this
fashion
,
”
he
added
,
as
he
struck
the
heated
iron
.
<EOS>
“What
!
<EOS>
would
you
serve
Charles
Stuart
himself
so
?
”
<EOS>
demanded
Charles
.
<EOS>
“Ay
,
marry
,
him
worse
than
any
other
,
”
replied
the
blacksmith
,
with
a
blow
that
made
the
anvil
ring
.
<EOS>
“
I
heard
say
at
Arundel
that
the
Young
Man
has
been
taken
,
and
I
hope
it
be
true
.
<EOS>
”“Well
,
one
thing
is
quite
certain
,
thou
wouldst
never
lend
him
a
hand
to
escape
,
”
observed
Charles
.
<EOS>
“No
,
nor
a
shoe
,
nor
a
nail
<EOS>
,
”
replied
the
smith
.
<EOS>
“
I
’d
lame
his
horse
,
if
he
brought
him
to
me
.
<EOS>
”“Well
,
do
n’t
lame
mine
,
<EOS>
friend
,
I
prithee
,
”
said
Charles
.
<EOS>
“
Take
him
to
the
stable
,
and
see
him
well
fed
when
thou
hast
done
.
<EOS>
I
must
in
to
breakfast
.

”The
<EOS>
blacksmith
promising
compliance
<EOS>
,
Charles
entered
the
little
inn
,
where
he
found
his
companions
seated
at
a
table
,
with
a
goodly
loaf
of
bread
,
a
half-
consumed
cheese
,
and
a
lump
of
butter
before
them
,
together
with
two
capacious
jugs
filled
with
ale
,
and
drinking
-
horns
.
<EOS>
They
did
not
rise
,
of
course
,
on
his
Majesty
’s
appearance
,
but
he
took
the
place
reserved
for
him
between
Clavering
and
Lord
Wilmot
.
<EOS>
Charles
was
scarcely
seated
when
a
large
dish
of
fried
ham
and
eggs
was
placed
upon
the
table
by
a
comely
-
looking
damsel
.
<EOS>
A
second
supply
was
ordered
to
be
prepared
,
and
the
king
and
his
hungry
followers
did
ample
justice
to
the
repast
.
<EOS>
Having
pretty
nearly
cleared
the
board
and
quite
emptied
both
jugs
of
their
contents
,
the
party
arose
,
and
called
for
the
reckoning
,
which
was
moderate
enough
,
as
may
be
supposed
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Gunter
defrayed
it
,
while
the
others
went
forth
to
look
after
their
steeds
.
<EOS>
The
blacksmith
had
charge
of
the
king
’s
horse
,
and
in
return
for
the
half
-
crown
which
Charles
bestowed
upon
him
,
wished
the
young
monarch
a
prosperous
journey
,
adding,“And
<EOS>
that
’s
more
than
I
would
wish
Charles
Stuart
.
<EOS>
But
talking
of
the
Young
Man
,
master
,
what
manner
of
man
is
he?”“A
marvellous
proper
man
,
”
replied
the
king
;
“
about
”
a
foot
taller
than
myself
,
very
broad
across
the
shoulders
,
fair
-
haired—”“Nay
,
that
ca
n’t
be
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
blacksmith
,
“
<EOS>
for
I
have
heard
tell
that
he
is
as
dark
as
a
gipsy
.
<EOS>
I
should
say
he
was
more
like
your
honour
.
<EOS>
”“How
<EOS>
now
,
sirrah
!
<EOS>
hast
thou
<EOS>
the
impudence
to
tell
me
to
my
face
that
I
am
like
Charles
Stuart
?
”
cried
the
king
,
with
affected
wrath
.
<EOS>
“
I
have
half
a
mind
to
chastise
thee
.
<EOS>
”“Nay
,
I
meant
no
offence
,
”
replied
the
smith
.
<EOS>
“
The
devil
,
they
say
,
is
not
so
black
as
he
’s
painted
,
and
a
man
may
be
swart
as
a
gipsy
and
yet
handsome
for
all
that
.
<EOS>
Handsome
is
that
handsome
does
,
and
your
honour
having
paid
me
handsomely
,
I
wish
you
a
prosperous
journey
.
<EOS>
Good
luck
attend
you
wherever
you
go
!
”
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
retired
into
his
smithy
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
all
the
party
having
mounted
,
they
again
set
forth
on
their
way
.

CHAPTER
VThe
Patriarch
Of
The
DownsANGMERING
PARK
,
through
a
portion
of
which
the
royal
party
now
rode
,
possessed
many
points
of
great
beauty
,
and
boasted
much
noble
timber
.
<EOS>
In
especial
,
there
was
a
fine
grove
of
oaks
,
old
as
the
Druids
,
and
tenanted
at
that
time
by
a
colony
of
herons
;
the
birds
,
or
their
progeny
,
having
since
migrated
to
Parham
.
<EOS>
Charles
cast
a
passing
glance
at
the
long
-
legged
,
long
-
necked
birds
congregated
on
the
higher
branches
of
the
trees
,
and
listened
for
a
moment
to
their
harsh
cries
.
<EOS>
Quitting
Angmering
Park
,
and
approaching
Clapham
Wood
through
a
beautiful
sylvan
district
,
the
party
now
obtained
a
fine
view
of
Highdown
Hill
,
on
the
summit
of
which
,
in
later
years
,
has
been
placed
the
Miller
’s
Tomb
.
<EOS>
From
ClaphamWood
the
travellers
made
their
way
towards
Findon
,
proceeding
along
the
valley
at
the
base
of
Cissbury
Hill
,
a
noble
down
,
boasting
,
like
so
many
of
its
neighbouring
eminences
,
a
large
encampment
,
and
commanding
extensive
views
both
of
sea
and
land
.
<EOS>
Mounting
the
western
slope
of
down
in
order
to
enjoy
the
prospect
,
the
troop
presently
came
to
some
circular
hollows
similar
to
those
which
they
had
previously
passed
at
Stoke
Down
.
<EOS>
In
one
of
these
cavities
a
little
hut
had
been
constructed
.
<EOS>
On
a
wooden
bench
in
front
of
the
lowly
habitation
sat
a
venerable
figure
,
which
irresistibly
attracted
the
king
’s
attention
,
and
arrested
his
progress
.
<EOS>
The
personage
seemed
to
be
of
an
age
almost
patriarchal
,
to
judge
from
his
hoary
locks
and
long
silvery
beard
.
<EOS>
Originally
,
he
must
have
been
of
lofty
stature
,
but
his
frame
was
bent
by
the
weight
of
years
,
and
his
limbs
shrunken
.
<EOS>
His
head
was
uncovered
,
and
his
brow
and
features
ploughed
deeply
with
wrinkles
.
<EOS>
His
garb
was
that
of
a
common
shepherd
of
the
downs
.
<EOS>
At
his
feet
lay
a
dog
,
whose
appearance
was
almost
as
antiquated
as
that
of
his
master
.
<EOS>
On
the
bench
near
this
patriarch
of
the
hills
sat
a
little
girl
,
who
was
reading
the
Bible
to
him
.
<EOS>
Perceiving
from
the
king
’s
looks
that
he
desired
to
know
something
concerning
this
venerable
personage
,
Colonel
Gunter
informed
his
Majesty
that
the
name
of
the
shepherd
was
Oswald
Barcombe
.
<EOS>
He
was
what
in
popular
parlance
was
called
a
“
wise
man
,
”
and
had
had
plenty
of
time
to
acquire
wisdom
,
for
his
life
had
extended
far
beyond
the
limits
ordinarily
allotted
to
man
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
—
almost
beyond
the
memory
of
the
existing
generation
—
he
had
inhabited
that
hollow
,
and
had
scooped
out
a
cave
in
the
chalk
,
with
which
the
hut
communicated
.
<EOS>
These
particulars
,
combined
with
the
old
shepherd
’s
venerable
and
patriarchal
appearance
,
interested
Charles
so
much
that
he
alighted
,
and
committing
his
horse
to
Clavering
,
advanced
alone
towards
the
cavity
in
the
midst
of
which
the
old
man
was
seated
.
<EOS>
Perceiving
the
stranger
approach
,
the
little
girl
left
off
reading
,
and
pulled
the
old
man
by
the
sleeve
to
make
him
aware
that
some
one
was
at
hand
.
<EOS>
Thus
admonished
,
the
patriarch
raised
his
head
,
and
fixed
his
dim
,
almost
sightless
orbs
on
the
king
.
<EOS>
“Who
art
thou
that
seekest
the
dwelling
of
old
Oswald
Barcombe
?
”
<EOS>
he
demanded
.
<EOS>
“A
wanderer
,
without
home
or
name
,
”
replied
the
king
.
<EOS>
“
A
price
is
set
upon
my
head
,
and
I
am
flying
from
a
country
which
I
can
no
more
call
mine
own
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
looking
upon
thee
,
old
man
,
I
could
not
pass
thy
dwelling
without
craving
thy
blessing
.
<EOS>
”“Thou
shalt
have
my
blessing
and
welcome
,
my
son
,
”
replied
the
venerable
shepherd
;
“
and
I
trust
it
may
profit
thee
.
<EOS>
”“Tell
<EOS>
me
<EOS>
thy
age
,
I
prithee
,
father
?
”
said
the
king
.
<EOS>
“
Thou
must
have
seen
many
years
.
<EOS>
”“Many
,
<EOS>
many
years
,
my
son
.
<EOS>
A
hundred
and
ten
,
as
far
as
I
can
reckon
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
a
year
more
,
or
a
year
less
,
for
I
have
wellnigh
lost
the
count
.
<EOS>
Many
changes
have
I
seen
as
well
as
years
.
<EOS>
When
I
was
a
lad
,
bluff
Harry
the
Eighth
ruled
the
land
,
and
I
lived
through
the
reigns
of
all
his
children
.
<EOS>
They
were
a
royal
race
,
those
Tudors
.
<EOS>
The
Stuarts
came
next
,
and
I
saw
them
both
out
,
father
and
son
,
though
good
King
Charles
might
have
been
on
the
throne
now
,
if
his
enemies
had
not
done
him
to
death
.
<EOS>
”“Thou
<EOS>
sayest
<EOS>
truly
,
old
man
,
”
replied
Charles
.
<EOS>
“
‘
Twas
a
deed
of
which
a
terrible
account
will
be
required
of
the
parricides
hereafter
,
should
they
even
escape
earthly
punishment
.
<EOS>
But
I
honour
thee
for
thy
courage
,
old
friend
.
<EOS>
Few
men
there
are
—
whatever
their
secret
sentiments
may
be
—
<EOS>
bold
enough
,
now
-
a
-
days
,
to
couple
the
epithet
‘
good
’
with
the
name
of
Charles
the
First
.
<EOS>
”“But
<EOS>
Charles
the
First
was
a
good
king
,
and
I
will
maintain
it
,
”
replied
Oswald
.
<EOS>
“
I
am
too
old
to
be
a
Republican
.
<EOS>
Go
into
the
cave
,
my
child
,
and
tarry
there
till
I
call
thee
forth
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
word
to
say
in
private
to
this
stranger
.
<EOS>
”And
<EOS>
as
the
girl
departed
on
the
old
man
’s
behest
,
Charles
inquired
,
with
some
curiosity
,
if
the
little
maid
was
his
granddaughter
.
<EOS>
“She
belongs
to
the
fourth
generation
,
”
replied
the
old
shepherd
.
<EOS>
“
Edith
is
my
great
-
grandson
’s
daughter
.
<EOS>
But
now
that
she
is
gone
,
I
will
speak
to
thee
plainly
.
<EOS>
Thou
hast
intimated
to
me
that
thou
art
a
fugitive
Royalist
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
give
thee
shelter
,
but
I
can
offer
thee
sympathy
.
<EOS>
I
love
not
the
present
state
of
things
.
<EOS>
Night
and
day
do
I
pray
for
the
young
king
’s
safety
,
and
for
his
restoration
to
the
throne
of
his
ancestors
.
<EOS>
In
all
likelihood
I
am
the
oldest
man
in
the
land
,
and
Heaven
will
listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
”‘Say’st
<EOS>
thou
<EOS>
so
,
father
?
”
<EOS>
cried
Charles
;
“
then
the
king
might
trust
his
life
to
thee?”“Is
the
king
on
these
hills
?
”
<EOS>
demanded
the
old
shepherd
,
trembling
.
<EOS>
“He
stands
before
thee
!
”
exclaimed
Charles
.
<EOS>
“
Nay
,
he
kneels
to
thee
—
implores
thy
blessing
.
<EOS>
Thou
wilt
not
withhold
it
,
father?”Mastering
his
astonishment
by
a
marvellous
effort
,
with
a
dignity
which
nothing
but
extreme
age
could
impart
,
and
with
an
expression
of
countenance
almost
sublime
,
the
patriarch
spread
his
arms
over
the
head
of
the
kneeling
monarch
,
and
in
a
tone
of
the
utmost
solemnity
and
fervour
pronounced
a
benediction
upon
him
.
<EOS>
“I
feel
that
this
blessing
from
one
who
,
like
thyself
,
has
outlived
all
earthly
passions
,
will
indeed
profit
me
,
”
said
Charles
,
rising
.
<EOS>
“
I
am
compelled
to
fly
from
my
kingdom
,
but
I
shall
return
to
it
ere
long
,
and
trust
to
find
thee
living
.
<EOS>
”“Not
<EOS>
so
,
sire
<EOS>
,
”
replied
old
Oswald
;
“
my
sand
is
nearly
run
.
<EOS>
You
will
reascend
the
throne
—
of
that
I
am
well
assured
—
but
ere
that
happy
event
occurs
,
the
old
shepherd
of
Cissbury
Hill
will
be
laid
in
the
grave
already
digged
for
him
in
this
hollow
.
<EOS>
But
while
life
remains
he
will
not
cease
to
pray
for
your
restoration
.
<EOS>
Yet
take
counsel
from
me
,
sire
,
”
the
old
man
continued
,
in
a
slightly
troubled
tone
.
<EOS>
“I
dream
dreams
,
and
behold
visions
.
<EOS>
I
have
watched
the
stars
on
many
a
night
from
this
hill
-
top
,
and
have
learnt
strange
lore
from
the
heavenly
bodies
.
<EOS>
To-
day
you
are
in
safety
,
but
be
not
found
within
this
rebellious
land
to-
morrow

<EOS>
”“I
design
not
to
be
so
,
”
replied
the
king
.
<EOS>
“
<EOS>
Fare
thee
well
,
father
!
”
<EOS>
And
he
extended
his
hand
to
the
patriarch
,
who
pressed
it
reverently
to
his
lips
.
<EOS>
“
Give
this
to
little
Edith
,
”
added
Charles
,
placing
a
piece
of
gold
in
the
old
man
’s
palm
.
<EOS>
“
Once
more
,
farewell!”He
then
ran
quickly
up
the
side
of
the
little
hollow
,
mounted
his
horse
,
and
rode
off
,
remaining
silent
and
abstracted
for
some
time
,
much
to
the
disappointment
of
his
escort
,
who
were
curious
to
learn
what
had
passed
between
him
and
the
old
shepherd
of
Cissbury
Hill
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VIWhat
Happened
At
The
“
White
Horse
”
<EOS>
At
SteyningLEAVING
Findon
to
the
left
,
the
travellers
next
crossed
the
range
of
hills
,
of
which
the
lofty
headland
known
as
Chanctonbury
Ring
is
the
termination
on
the
north
-
west
,
and
descended
upon
Steyning
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
their
intention
to
push
on
to
Bramber
,
but
on
entering
the
town
they
accidentally
learnt
that
a
troop
of
horse
had
just
ridden
off
in
that
direction
,
so
they
judged
it
best
to
make
a
brief
halt
lest
they
should
overtake
them
.
<EOS>
Riding
into
the
yard
of
the
White
Horse
,
they
dismounted
,
and
ordered
their
horses
to
be
taken
to
the
stables
.
<EOS>
There
were
a
good
many
persons
in
the
yard
at
the
time
,
and
amongst
them
were
two
individuals
,
who
,
despite
their
threadbare
apparel
,
gave
themselves
great
airs
,
strutted
about
like
well
-
clad
gallants
,
pounding
the
earth
with
their
heavy
-
heeled
boots
,
and
making
their
long
rapiers
clatter
against
the
stones
.
<EOS>
These
two
personages
,
who
were
no
other
than
the
redoubted
Captain
Goldspur
and
his
friend
Jervoise
Rumboldsdyke
,
had
watched
the
arrival
of
the
party
with
some
curiosity
,
and
as
Charles
was
about
to
enter
the
house
,
the
captain
strode
up
to
him
,
and
said
,
in
a
low
,
significant
tone
,
“
<EOS>
Art
thou
a
friend
to
Cæsar
?
”
<EOS>
And
then
,
without
waiting
for
a
reply
,
he
exclaimed
,
“
Why
,
zounds
!
<EOS>
can
it
be?—it
is
—
it
is
Cæsar
<EOS>
himself!”“Be
silent
,
sir
!
<EOS>
—
I
charge
you
on
your
allegiance
,
”
said
Charles
,
authoritatively
.
<EOS>
“I
am
dumb
,
sire
,
”
replied
Goldspur
,
respectfully
.
<EOS>
“
But
I
pray
your
Majesty
to
believe
that
my
sword
,
my
life
,
are
at
your
disposal
.
<EOS>
”Rumboldsdyke
<EOS>
coming
up
at
the
moment
,
his
friend
whispered
a
word
to
him
,
which
instantly
produced
a
magical
effect
upon
the
ruffling
blade
,
whose
demeanour
became
as
respectful
as
that
of
Goldspur
.
<EOS>
“This
is
Master
Jervoise
Rumboldsdyke
,
an
it
please
your
Majesty
,
”
said
Goldspur
,
in
a
low
tone
.
<EOS>
“
<EOS>
Like
myself
,
he
hath
lost
his
fortune
in
your
service
.
<EOS>
But
what
matters
that
?
<EOS>
We
would
lose
fifty
fortunes
—
if
we
had
them
—
in
such
a
cause
—
and
our
lives
into
the
bargain
.
<EOS>
Would
we
not
,
Rumboldsdyke?”“Ay
,
that
would
we
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
other
ruffler
.
<EOS>
Charles
would
have
gladly
dispensed
both
with
the
presence
and
professions
of
such
suspicious
adherents
,
but
fearing
some
indiscretion
on
their
part
,
he
deemed
it
best
to
keep
them
in
sight
,
and
therefore
invited
them
to
enter
the
house
,
and
drink
a
bottle
of
canary
with
him
—
an
invitation
which
,
as
may
be
supposed
,
they
gratefully
accepted
.
<EOS>
Charles
found
Colonel
Gunter
waiting
for
him
just
within
the
doorway
,
and
the
latter
looked
surprised
and
somewhat
uneasy
at
perceiving
his
Majesty
attended
by
the
two
threadbare
Cavaliers
.
<EOS>
A
glance
from
the
king
,
however
,
reassured
him
,
and
on
looking
more
narrowly
at
the
persons
with
him
,
he
remembered
to
have
seen
them
amongst
the
guests
at
the
Poynings
’
Arms
on
the
night
when
he
was
taken
there
by
Stelfax
,
after
his
descent
of
the
declivity
near
the
Devil
’s
Dyke
.
<EOS>
Goldspur
,
however
,
sought
to
set
him
completely
at
ease
by
stepping
up
to
him
,
and
saying
in
his
ear,“It
is
all
right
,
Colonel
Gunter
.
<EOS>
We
are
both
friends
to
Cæsar
—
both
men
of
honesty
and
mettle
.
<EOS>
Do
you
not
remember
the
night
at
the
Poynings
’
Arms
,
when
that
rascally
Ironside
captain
brought
you
a
prisoner
there
?
<EOS>
Do
you
not
recollect
Captain
Goldspur
and
his
friend
Jervoise
Rumboldsdyke
?
<EOS>
I
made
an
effort
for
your
liberation
.
<EOS>
A
shot
was
fired
from
Patcham
Wood
:
‘
twas
I
who
sent
the
bullet
at
the
accursed
Stelfax!”“Enough
!
enough
!
<EOS>
Captain
Goldspur
.
<EOS>
I
remember
you
perfectly
,
”
replied
Gunter
,
hastily
.
<EOS>
“
But
come
into
this
private
room
.
<EOS>
We
shall
be
more
at
our
ease
there
.
<EOS>
”So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
led
the
way
into
a
parlour
looking
towards
the
back
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Charles
had
already
preceded
him
,
and
having
hastily
apprised
the
others
of
the
addition
they
might
expect
to
their
party
,
they
were
prepared
for
the
appearance
of
the
two
rufflers
.
<EOS>
Glasses
and
a
couple
of
flasks
of
canary
had
already
been
placed
on
the
table
,
so
there
was
no
present
occasion
to
summon
the
host
;
and
<EOS>
Gunter
,
having
closed
the
door
in
order
to
prevent
intrusion
,
proceeded
to
introduce
the
new
comers
,
whom
he
described
as
men
who
would
not
stick
at
a
trifle
to
serve
their
friends
.
<EOS>
The
introduction
over
,
Lord
Wilmot
,
in
a
haughty
tone
,
thus
addressed
them:“Harkye
,
Captain
Goldspur
,
and
you
,
Master
Rumboldsdyke
—
since
such
are
the
names
you
choose
to
go
by—”“‘Go
by’—was
that
the
word
?
”
<EOS>
interrupted
Goldspur
,
indignantly
.
<EOS>
“
They
are
as
much
our
names
,
my
lord
,
as
Henry
Wilmot
,
Baron
Wilmot
in
England
,
and
Viscount
Wilmot
in
Ireland
,
is
your
own
.
”“Oddsfish
,
my
lord
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Charles
,
laughing
,
“
you
are
known
to
these
gentlemen
,
it
seems
,
as
well
as
we
ourselves
appear
to
be
.
”“It
<EOS>
were
needless
to
remind
his
lordship
where
we
have
had
the
honour
of
meeting
him
,
”
observed
Goldspur
.
<EOS>
“
But
if
he
desires
it
,
I
will
mention—”“Nay
,
it
is
needless
to
enter
into
particulars
,
”
cried
Lord
Wilmot
.
<EOS>
“
I
fancy
I
have
seen
your
faces
before
,
but
not
under
very
creditable
circumstances
.
<EOS>
”“Your
<EOS>
lordship
does
not
mean
to
cast
any
reflections
upon
our
honour
,
I
trust
?
”
<EOS>
said
Goldspur
,
frowning
,
and
laying
his
hand
upon
the
hilt
of
his
blade
.
<EOS>
“Oh
,
not
in
the
least
,
captain
,
”
said
Lord
Wilmot
,
calmly
.
<EOS>
“
I
have
no
doubt
you
are
both
men
of
honour
,
according
to
your
own
acceptation
of
the
term
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
about
to
observe
,
when
you
first
interrupted
me
,
that
you
have
chosen
to
force
your
company
upon
us—”“Force
,
my
lord
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Goldspur
,
indignantly
.
<EOS>
“
Neither
Master
Rumboldsdyke
nor
myself
desire
to
force
our
company
upon
any
man
.
<EOS>
We
sought
only
to
offer
our
swords
and
our
lives
to
our
gracious
master
.
<EOS>
We
yield
to
no
man
living
—
not
even
to
yourself
,
Lord
Wilmot
—
in
devotion
to
the
king
,
and
we
are
ready
to
approve
it
.
<EOS>
We
may
have
tarnished
cloaks
and
threadbare
jerkins
,
but
we
have
loyal
hearts
in
our
breasts
.
<EOS>
”“I
believe
you
,
gentlemen
—
I
believe
you
,
”
replied
the
king
.
<EOS>
“
Wilmot
,
thou
art
wrong
in
doubting
these
good
fellows
.
<EOS>
”“I
hope
I
am
,
”
replied
his
lordship
;
“
but
I
must
be
permitted
to
observe
,
that
if
I
perceive
the
slightest
indication
of
treachery
on
their
part
,
I
shall
not
hesitate
to
shoot
both
of
them
through
the
head
.
<EOS>
”“If
<EOS>
his
Majesty
is
satisfied
with
our
professions
we
are
content
,
”
said
Goldspur
.
<EOS>
“And
<EOS>
so
I
am
,
”
replied
the
king
—
”
though
it
will
be
needful
to
keep
a
wary
eye
upon
them
,
”
he
muttered
to
himself
.
<EOS>
“
Sit
down
,
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
Stand
not
upon
ceremony
with
me
,
but
fill
your
glasses
to
the
brim
.
<EOS>
”“Mine
<EOS>
shall
be
emptied
to
a
pledge
that
I
drink
daily
,
”
quoth
Goldspur
.
<EOS>
May
the
king
enjoy
his
own
again
,
and
that
right
speedily!“I
echo
the
sentiment
!
”
<EOS>
added
Rumboldsdyke
.
<EOS>
“I
thank
you
both
for
this
display
of
your
loyalty
and
attachment
,
”
said
Charles
;
<EOS>
“
but
I
must
pray
you
to
be
prudent
,
and
make
no
further
demonstration
of
your
zeal
.
<EOS>
We
are
bound
to
Bramber
,
and
perhaps
to
Brightelmstone
.
<EOS>
Is
there
any
danger
on
the
way?”“A
troop
of
horse
has
just
gone
on
to
Shoreham
,
sire
,
”
said
Goldspur
.
<EOS>
“
But
they
will
have
passed
through
Bramber
before
you
get
there
.
<EOS>
”“Can
<EOS>
you
tell
us
aught
of
Stelfax
,
Captain
Goldspur
?
”
<EOS>
inquired
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“The
<EOS>
detested
dog
is
still
at
Lewes
,
”
replied
the
other
,
“
and
is
constantly
occupied
in
scouring
the
country
,
and
searching
houses
for
fugitive
Cavaliers
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
for
me
to
inquire
into
his
Majesty
’s
plans
,
but
if
they
are
such
as
to
require
the
service
of
scouts
upon
the
motions
of
the
enemy
,
so
as
to
give
timely
notice
of
danger
,
I
and
Master
Rumboldsdyke
will
be
ready
to
perform
the
office
,
and
we
have
companions
who
will
lend
us
aid
.
<EOS>
”“May
<EOS>
it
not
be
advisable
to
employ
these
men
as
scouts
?
”
<EOS>
said
Charles
,
in
a
low
tone
to
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“I
think
so
,
most
undoubtedly
,
”
the
young
man
replied
.
<EOS>
“
Hark
ye
,
Captain
Goldspur
,
”
he
continued
aloud
,
“
his
Majesty
thinks
well
of
your
proposal
.
<EOS>
You
and
your
friend
,
I
presume
,
are
provided
with
horses
.
<EOS>
Ride
to
Lewes
,
or
the
neighbourhood
,
with
all
possible
dispatch
.
<EOS>
Station
your
scouts
about
Southover
,
and
about
the
western
side
of
the
town
,
and
if
any
sudden
movements
are
made
this
evening
by
Stelfax
,
or
the
Ironsides
,
give
us
immediate
warning
at
my
father
’s
residence
,
Ovingdean
Grange
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
way
to
it
<EOS>
,
I
make
no
doubt
,
across
the
downs
.
<EOS>
”“It
<EOS>
will
not
be
the
first
time
that
I
and
Master
Rumboldsdyke
have
visited
Ovingdean
Grange
,
”
replied
Goldspur
.
<EOS>
“
We
have
recently
become
acquainted
with
your
worthy
father
,
Colonel
Maunsel
.
”“Indeed
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Clavering
in
surprise“And
<EOS>
I
may
add
,
”
pursued
Goldspur
,
“
we
have
served
him
in
the
capacity
we
are
about
to
serve
his
Majesty
;
we
have
acted
as
his
scouts
upon
the
detested
Stelfax
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
more
,
we
have
watched
over
Mock
-
Beggar
Hall
,
where
worthy
Master
Beard
and
his
daughter
,
the
lovely
Mistress
Dulcia
,
were
lodged
during
their
stay
at
Lewes
,
and
we
escorted
them
back
to
the
Grange
.
<EOS>
”“What
<EOS>
you
tell
me
,
captain
,
satisfies
me
that
you
may
indeed
be
trusted
,
”
said
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“Why
,
it
seems
we
have
stumbled
on
the
very
men
we
needed
,
”
observed
Charles
.
<EOS>
“
But
who
is
this
lovely
Mistress
Dulcia
Beard
<EOS>
they
have
guarded?”“The
daughter
of
my
father
’s
chaplain
.
<EOS>
Your
Majesty
will
behold
her
at
Ovingdean
Grange
,
”
replied
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“And
shall
find
her
,
no
doubt
,
well
worthy
our
regard
,
”
replied
the
king
,
noticing
the
young
man
’s
heightened
colour
.
<EOS>
“Have
we
your
Majesty
’s
<EOS>
commands
to
set
forward
to
Lewes
on
this
service
?
”
demanded
Goldspur
.
<EOS>
“You
<EOS>
have
,
sir
,
”
replied
Charles
.
<EOS>
“
And
we
pray
you
to
lose
no
time
by
the
way
.
<EOS>
If
there
should
be
danger
,
you
will
not
fail
to
make
it
known
to
Colonel
Maunsel
,
at
Ovingdean
Grange
.
<EOS>
”“On
<EOS>
that
your
Majesty
may
rely
.
<EOS>
We
now
humbly
take
our
leave
.
”
<EOS>
On
this
the
twain
made
a
profound
obeisance
and
departed
.
<EOS>
“And
<EOS>
your
Majesty
is
of
opinion
that
these
fellows
may
be
trusted
?
”
<EOS>
observed
Lord
Wilmot
,
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
.
<EOS>
“I
am
convinced
of
it
,
”
replied
Charles
.
<EOS>
“
I
have
not
the
slightest
misgiving
as
to
their
fidelity
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
I
think
it
very
lucky
we
encountered
them
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
hope
it
may
turn
out
as
you
anticipate
,
”
said
Lord
Wilmot
;
“
<EOS>
but
I
am
not
without
fears
to
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
”“Thou
art
always
full
of
apprehension
,
Wilmot
,
”
said
the
king
.
<EOS>
“
I
never
allow
fears
to
disturb
me
.
<EOS>
Give
me
another
glass
of
canary
.
<EOS>
Here
is
to
fair
Mistress
Dulcia
Beard
!
”
<EOS>
he
added
,
with
a
smile
at
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“
You
must
tell
me
more
about
her
as
we
ride
on
.
<EOS>
”Charles
and
<EOS>
his
companions
remained
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
longer
in
the
parlour
.
<EOS>
They
then
summoned
the
host
,
paid
their
shot
,
and
called
for
their
horses
.
<EOS>
As
the
street
near
the
inn
seemed
to
be
rather
full
of
people
,
and
some
one
amongst
them
might
possibly
recognize
the
royal
fugitive
,
it
was
agreed
that
his
Majesty
’s
horse
should
be
led
to
the
outskirts
of
the
town
,
on
the
road
to
Bramber
,
where
he
could
join
them
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
while
the
others
were
engaged
with
the
ostler
,
Charles
slipped
away
,
and
proceeding
along
the
street
in
which
stands
the
curious
old
gabled
house
called
the
Brotherhood
Hall
,
even
then
used
as
a
grammar
school
,
soon
reached
the
antique
church
,
built
on
the
site
of
the
still
older
wooden
fabric
constructed
by
Saint
Cuthman
,
of
whom
mention
has
been
made
in
an
earlier
portion
of
our
Tale
.
<EOS>
Having
lingered
near
this
old
pile
for
a
few
minutes
,
without
bestowing
many
thoughts
,
we
fear
,
upon
good
Saint
Cuthman
,
Charles
set
off
again
,
and
marching
at
a
quick
pace
was
presently
out
of
the
town
,
and
at
the
spot
where
his
attendants
were
waiting
for
him
.
<EOS>
Here
he
mounted
his
horse
,
and
the
troop
set
off
for
Bramber
,
the
woody
mound
upon
which
the
ruins
of
the
old
Norman
castle
are
situated
rising
majestically
before
them
at
the
distance
of
less
than
a
mile

CHAPTER
VIIDitchling
BeaconTHE
royal
wanderer
,
now
approaching
the
ancient
stronghold
of
the
Braoses
,
had
neither
leisure
nor
inclination
to
mount
the
woody
side
of
the
eminence
and
examine
the
shattered
fragment
of
its
keep
,
supposed
to
have
been
demolished
by
gunpowder
,
but
was
.
<EOS>
fain
to
content
himself
with
such
view
as
the
road
afforded
of
the
picturesque
ruins
of
the
castle
,
and
the
venerable
church
of
Saint
Nicholas
nestling
under
its
grey
and
crumbling
walls
.
<EOS>
Charles
,
however
,
was
much
amused
by
the
diminutive
size
and
quaint
architecture
of
the
habitations
composing
the
little
village
of
Bramher
,
many
of
which
were
so
low
that
a
tall
man
could
look
in
at
their
upper
windows
.
<EOS>
Several
of
these
curious
old
houses
,
which
were
built
towards
the
latter
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
,
are
still
left
,
and
a
very
good
notion
of
an
English
village
in
Shakespeare
<EOS>
’s
time
may
be
formed
by
a
visit
to
Bramber
.
<EOS>
The
king
’s
advance
-
guard
ascertained
,
greatly
to
their
satisfaction
,
that
the
troop
of
Republican
soldiers
had
gone
on
to
Shoreham
;
and
as
Charles
crossed
the
little
bridge
over
the
Adur
,
he
could
see
the
long
line
of
red
coats
,
distinguishable
by
their
glittering
casques
and
corslets
,
passing
on
the
left
bank
of
the
river
on
their
way
thither
.
<EOS>
Under
ordinary
circumstances
the
royal
party
would
have
taken
the
same
route
;
but
even
if
they
had
intended
it
,
the
hostile
force
in
advance
would
have
deterred
them
from
proceeding
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
They
now
proposed
to
continue
their
journey
along
a
little
-
frequented
road
,
leading
from
the
defile
of
the
Adur
to
Poynings
,
and
running
at
the
foot
of
the
precipitous
range
of
downs
overlooking
the
Weald
of
Sussex
.
<EOS>
Here
it
was
that
Colonel
Gunter
,
and
his
kinsman
the
captain
,
took
leave
of
the
king
for
a
while
,
and
struck
off
along
the
uplands
on
the
east
bank
of
the
Adur
,
in
the
direction
of
Shoreham
<EOS>
,
it
being
the
colonel
’s
intention
to
seek
an
interview
with
Captain
Tattersall
,
and
ensure
,
at
any
cost
,
the
skipper
’s
departure
before
daybreak
.
<EOS>
The
colonel
set
out
to
his
expedition
,
full
of
confidence
that
he
should
be
at
Ovingdean
Grange
almost
as
soon
as
the
king
himself
,
and
should
bring
his
Majesty
word
that
all
had
been
satisfactorily
settled
.
<EOS>
While
,
therefore
,
Charles
and
his
now
diminished
escort
rode
in
one
direction
,
Colonel
Gunter
and
his
kinsman
set
off
in
another
;
the
latter
shaping
their
course
towards
Shoreham
,
but
keeping
on
the
acclivities
,
in
order
to
avoid
the
soldiers
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Charles
and
his
party
,
who
were
now
under
the
guidance
of
Clavering
,
crossed
the
spur
of
a
down
extending
into
the
mighty
fissure
through
which
the
Adur
finds
it
way
to
the
sea
,
and
then
look
their
way
along
the
foot
of
the
lofty
escarpment
to
the
picturesque
village
of
Poynings
,
which
we
have
visited
on
a
former
occasion
.
<EOS>
On
the
road
to
Poynings
the
king
failed
not
to
question
Clavering
as
to
the
state
of
his
feelings
in
respect
to
Dulcia
Beard
,
and
having
ascertained
,
beyond
a
doubt
,
that
the
young
man
’s
affections
were
irrevocably
fixed
upon
the
damsel
,
he
promised
to
exert
all
his
influence
with
Colonel
Maunsel
to
induce
him
to
assent
to
the
match
.
<EOS>
“And
I
will
lose
no
time
about
it
,
”
added
the
good
-
natured
monarch
.
<EOS>
“
I
will
attack
the
old
gentleman
on
the
subject
immediately
on
my
arrival
at
the
Grange
.
<EOS>
”At
<EOS>
Poynings
the
king
did
not
fail
to
admire
the
beautiful
old
church
,
and
the
ancient
manor
-
house
amidst
its
woods
;
neither
did
he
neglect
to
take
a
deep
draught
of
Simon
Piddinghoe
’s
stout
March
ale
,
a
black
jack
,
filled
to
the
brim
with
the
excellent
beverage
,
being
brought
to
the
door
of
the
hostel
by
the
officious
landlord
,
at
Clavering
’s
directions
.
<EOS>
Neither
did
his
Majesty
escape
without
a
brief
chat
with
the
talkative
schoolmaster
,
Cisbury
Oldfirle
,
who
came
forth
with
his
pipe
in
one
hand
and
a
jug
of
ale
in
the
other
,
to
have
a
word
with
the
strangers
,
and
who
,
thinking
that
the
king
looked
the
most
good-
humoured
person
of
the
party
,
took
the
liberty
of
addressing
him
.
<EOS>
The
record
of
their
conversation
,
however
,
has
not
been
preserved
.
<EOS>
Quitting
Poynings
,
the
royal
party
rode
off
,
and
proceeded
at
a
rapid
trot
along
a
pleasant
shady
lane
bordered
by
trees
,
whose
branches
often
overhung
it
,
until
they
came
to
the
foot
of
Wolstonbury
Hill
,
one
of
the
most
beautiful
of
the
South
Downs
,
which
rose
smoothly
and
gently
before
them
,
as
if
inviting
them
to
ascend
to
the
encampment
upon
its
brow
.
<EOS>
They
did
,
indeed
,
mount
so
far
upon
the
velvet
sward
of
the
hill
as
enabled
them
to
survey
the
surrounding
district
.
<EOS>
From
the
elevated
point
they
had
now
reached
they
overlooked
Danny
Park
,
which
then
contained
,
and
still
boasts
,
many
magnificent
oaks
,
and
other
fine
timber
.
<EOS>
Embosomed
in
the
midst
of
these
woods
stood
an
ancient
Elizabethan
mansion
—
yet
maintained
in
all
its
integrity
.
<EOS>
Further
on
,
at
the
outskirts
of
the
park
,
could
be
discerned
the
pretty
little
hamlet
of
Hurstpierrepoint
,
with
its
church
,
then
a
very
secluded
village
indeed
,
but
now
,
owing
to
the
convenience
of
railways
,
the
natural
beauty
of
the
spot
,
and
the
predilection
of
the
inhabitants
of
Brighton
for
it
,
promising
to
become
a
considerable
place
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
minutes
Charles
suffered
his
gaze
to
wander
over
this
fair
sylvan
scene
,
and
then
gave
the
word
to
his
attendants
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
Hereupon
Clavering
,
on
whom
,
as
we
have
said
,
the
conduct
of
the
troop
now
devolved
,
descended
to
the
plain
,
and
still
keeping
at
the
foot
of
the
downs
,
crossed
that
part
of
the
country
now
traversed
by
the
railway
,
and
pushed
on
till
he
came
nearly
to
the
foot
of
the
lofty
eminence
on
which
Ditchling
Beacon
is
situated
.
<EOS>
Here
the
travellers
climbed
the
downs
,
and
soon
gained
the
summit
of
this
majestic
hill
—
the
loftiest
point
amid
the
South
Downs
.
<EOS>
Within
a
short
distance
of
the
beacon
the
king
halted
,
in
order
to
enjoy
the
magnificent
prospect
.
<EOS>
Almost
the
whole
of
Sussex
now
lay
before
him
,
and
after
gazing
at
the
vast
panorama
for
some
minutes
in
silence
,
he
observed
,
with
a
sigh
,
deep
almost
as
that
heaved
by
the
Moorish
king
when
looking
back
on
his
lost
Granada,“When
<EOS>
shall
I
gaze
upon
this
splendid
prospect
again
?
<EOS>
when
shall
I
call
this
fair
country
mine
?
<EOS>
Heaven
only
knows!”“The
day
will
come
,
doubt
it
not
,
sire
,
”
exclaimed
Clavering
,
“
and
I
hope
to
bring
you
again
to
Ditchling
Beacon
,
and
remind
you
of
my
words
!
<EOS>
But
now
let
us
on
.
<EOS>
We
are
nearly
at
our
journey
’s
end
.
<EOS>
”“And
you
are
impatient
,
no
doubt
,
that
I
should
settle
the
business
with
your
father
,
”
replied
Charles
,
with
a
sudden
change
of
manner
.
<EOS>
“
Do
n’t
be
uneasy
.
<EOS>
Fair
Mistress
Dulcia
,
shall
be
yours!”They
now
set
forward
at
a
quick
trot
,
shaping
their
course
in
a
south-
easterly
direction
across
the
downs
,
and
made
such
good
progress
,
that
in
less
than
half
an
hour
they
had
gained
the
northern
extremity
of
the
White
Hawk
Hill
,
and
were
within
a
mile
of
their
destination
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
had
they
reached
this
point
,
than
a
man
started
from
out
a
patch
of
gorse
amidst
which
he
had
been
lying
,
and
ran
towards
them
.
<EOS>
It
was
Ninian
Saxby
.
<EOS>
“Is
<EOS>
all
right
?
”
demanded
the
king
.
<EOS>
“
May
we
safely
approach
the
Grange?”“With
perfect
safety
,
my
liege
,
”
replied
Ninian
,
doffing
his
cap
.
<EOS>
“
No
danger
whatever
to
be
apprehended
,
and
the
colonel
is
out
of
measure
delighted
at
the
honour
intended
him
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
little
cavalcade
was
now
once
more
in
motion
,
and
rode
on
till
they
came
to
the
ancient
barrow
at
the
summit
of
the
hill
,
at
the
rear
of
the
mansion
,
where
they
found
another
person
stationed
.
<EOS>
This
was
Eustace
Saxby
,
and
he
corroborated
his
son
’s
information
that
all
was
right
.
<EOS>
Here
the
party
dismounted
,
and
committing
their
horses
to
the
two
men
,
who
were
to
take
them
round
the
back
of
the
holt
to
the
stables
,
they
descended
the
hill
,
the
king
walking
by
the
side
of
Clavering
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
their
descent
of
the
hill
they
had
to
pass
a
small
cottage
,
somewhat
retired
from
the
road
,
and
shaded
by
an
elmtree
.
<EOS>
This
cottage
,
which
stood
opposite
the
north
garden
-
wall
of
the
Grange
,
belonged
to
Morefruit
Stone
,
the
Puritan
.
<EOS>
Within
it
,
at
this
moment
,
were
two
other
persons
besides
old
Morefruit
and
his
daughter
,
who
had
witnessed
,
with
great
surprise
,
and
even
consternation
,
the
arrival
of
the
royal
party
on
the
hill
-
top
.
<EOS>
Keeping
themselves
carefully
out
of
sight
,
these
individuals
watched
Clavering
and
his
royal
companion
as
they
descended
the
hill
together
,
and
on
beholding
the
king
,
who
accidentally
made
a
pause
near
the
cottage
,
one
of
the
spies
—
evidently
from
his
garb
an
officer
in
the
Republican
army
—
exclaimed
,
in
a
stern
,
wrathful
tone
to
the
other,“It
is
he
!
<EOS>
it
is
Charles
Stuart
himself
!
<EOS>
He
has
come
before
his
time
.
<EOS>
Thou
hast
deceived
me
,
or
hast
given
him
warning
.
<EOS>
”“I
have
not
deceived
thee
,
Captain
Stelfax
,
”
rejoined
Mickle
-
gift
;
“
neither
am
I
to
blame
if
Charles
Stuart
has
advanced
the
hour
of
his
arrival
.
<EOS>
”“But
<EOS>
he
finds
me
wholly
unprepared
?
”
<EOS>
cried
Stelfax
,
in
a
tone
of
fierce
disappointment
.
<EOS>
“
I
shall
lose
him
,
unless
he
tarries
for
the
night
in
the
dwelling
of
this
old
Amalekite
.
<EOS>
My
men
are
all
at
Lewes
.
<EOS>
What
is
to
be
done
?
<EOS>
I
shall
be
balked
of
my
prey
.
”“There
<EOS>
is
yet
a
means
of
accomplishing
his
capture
,
if
thou
darest
attempt
it
,
single
-
handed
,
”
replied
Micklegift
.
<EOS>
“What
is
there
I
dare
not
do
?
”
<EOS>
rejoined
Stelfax
.
<EOS>
“
Show
me
thy
plan
.
”“It
<EOS>
is
this
,
”
answered
Micklegift
.
<EOS>
“
I
will
introduce
thee
secretly
to
the
house
—
into
the
sleeping
-
chamber
of
the
old
Amalekite
.
<EOS>
We
shall
not
be
noticed
,
for
all
the
household
will
be
occupied
with
the
arrival
of
this
company
.
<EOS>
Peradventure
thou
mayst
be
able
to
seize
the
Young
Man
.
<EOS>
”“I
will
seize
him
,
or
slay
him
,
and
take
my
chance
for
the
rest
,
”
rejoined
Stelfax
,
in
a
determined
voice
.
<EOS>
“
Look
forth
,
I
prithee
,
”
he
added
to
Morefruit
Stone
,
“
and
see
if
they
be
gone
.
<EOS>
”“No
<EOS>
one
is
in
sight
,
”
replied
the
elder
,
looking
forth
.
<EOS>
“Stay
thou
within
thy
cottage
,
”
said
Stelfax
.
<EOS>
“
We
may
need
thee
anon
.
<EOS>
Make
good
thy
words
,
”
he
added
to
Micklegift
,
“
and
conduct
me
to
Colonel
Maunsel
’s
chamber
.
<EOS>
”On
<EOS>
this
they
quitted
the
cottage
together
,
and
taking
a
few
steps
up
the
hill
,
reached
the
door
in
the
wall
,
which
Micklegift
unlocked
.
<EOS>
They
then
went
into
the
garden
.

CHAPTER
VIIIOf
The
King
<EOS>
’s
Reception
<EOS>
At
The
GrangeON
approaching
the
front
of
the
mansion
,
Clavering
besought
the
king
’s
permission
to
step
forward
,
and
receiving
it
,
hastened
to
ring
the
bell
at
the
gate
,
and
thus
announce
to
his
father
the
arrival
of
his
royal
guest
.
<EOS>
Immediately
on
the
summons
,
which
he
had
for
some
time
been
impatiently
awaiting
,
Colonel
Maunsel
appeared
at
the
open
doorway
,
at
the
head
of
his
retainers
,
all
of
whom
were
clad
in
their
richest
liveries
,
as
if
for
some
high
festivity
.
<EOS>
Never
did
the
old
Cavalier
appear
to
greater
advantage
than
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
He
was
attired
in
a
rich
court
suit
of
black
velvet
,
with
rapier
and
plumed
Spanish
hat
to
correspond
,
and
being
roused
to
unwonted
energy
by
the
strong
excitement
of
the
moment
,
he
moved
with
all
his
former
grace
and
stateliness
.
<EOS>
Close
behind
him
came
Mr.
Beard
and
Dulcia
,
the
former
in
a
plain
suit
of
black
,
and
the
latter
attired
with
great
neatness
and
simplicity
,
but
without
any
pretension
to
show
or
elegance
.
<EOS>
Such
,
however
,
was
the
effect
of
her
charms
of
person
and
manner
,
and
so
little
<EOS>
did
she
require
the
aid
of
dress
and
ornament
,
that
Charles
,
when
he
beheld
her
,
was
quite
electrified
by
her
surpassing
beauty
,
and
thought
he
had
never
seen
court
dame
so
lovely
as
this
country
damsel
,
whose
sole
decoration
was
a
few
flowers
placed
amidst
her
fair
clustering
tresses
.
<EOS>
With
the
object
of
it
before
him
,
he
ceased
to
wonder
at
Clavering
’s
passion
.
<EOS>
Behind
Colonel
Maunsel
,
in
the
entrance
-
hall
,
appeared
all
the
retainers
that
could
be
mustered
for
the
occasion
—
all
,
as
we
have
just
intimated
,
in
gala
attire
.
<EOS>
None
of
these
,
it
may
be
proper
to
state
,
had
any
positive
knowledge
of
the
exalted
rank
of
the
guest
whom
their
master
was
about
to
welcome
,
though
most
of
them
suspected
the
truth
.
<EOS>
But
though
,
as
we
are
aware
,
the
whole
of
the
colonel
’s
household
were
staunch
Royalists
,
and
might
have
been
entrusted
with
the
secret
without
fear
of
the
consequences
,
the
only
one
amongst
them
absolutely
confided
in
was
old
Martin
Geere
.
<EOS>
Greatly
elated
,
and
anxious
to
maintain
his
master
’s
importance
,
the
old
serving
-
man
now
assumed
a
consequential
manner
and
dignified
deportment
quite
unlike
his
ordinary
bearing
.
<EOS>
He
was
provided
with
a
wand
to
marshal
the
household
,
and
enable
him
to
act
as
sort
of
usher
in
the
approaching
ceremony
.
<EOS>
At
the
precise
moment
when
the
old
Cavalier
appeared
at
the
doorway
,
attended
as
we
have
described
,
Charles
entered
the
gate
of
the
mansion
,
Clavering
respectfully
retiring
as
the
monarch
advanced
,
and
Lord
Wilmot
and
Colonel
Philips
holding
back
,
so
that
the
king
might
be
left
alone
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
disguise
adopted
by
the
royal
wanderer
,
and
the
change
effected
in
his
general
appearance
,
Colonel
Maunsel
instantly
recognised
him
,
and
,
taking
off
his
hat
,
advanced
slowly
and
with
great
dignity
,
but
with
the
most
profound
respect
,
to
meet
him
and
give
him
welcome
.
<EOS>
If
Charles
had
come
there
in
the
plenitude
of
his
power
,
in
gorgeous
apparel
,
and
attended
by
a
brilliant
bevy
of
courtiers
,
instead
of
as
a
proscribed
fugitive
,
and
scantily
attended
,
Colonel
Maunsel
could
not
have
shown
him
greater
reverence
.
<EOS>
It
was
with
great
difficulty
that
he
prevented
himself
from
bending
the
knee
to
the
young
king
,
and
it
was
only
,
indeed
,
a
gesture
from
Charles
that
restrained
him
.
<EOS>
Contenting
himself
,
therefore
,
with
making
a
profound
obeisance
,
he
said
,
with
a
look
that
conveyed
all
he
did
not
dare
to
utter
,
“
Welcome
,
sir
!
<EOS>
thrice
welcome
to
Ovingdean
Grange
.
<EOS>
My
poor
dwelling
is
honoured
indeed
by
the
presence
of
such
a
guest
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
thank
you
most
heartily
for
your
welcome
,
Colonel
Maunsel
,
”
replied
Charles
.
<EOS>
“
But
it
is
far
more
than
I
merit
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
other
claim
upon
your
attention
save
this
—
and
it
is
much
<EOS>
,
I
own
,
”
he
added
,
with
some
significance—“that
you
were
warmly
attached
to
my
father
.
<EOS>
”“No
<EOS>
man
<EOS>
more
so
,
sir
,
”
replied
the
old
Cavalier
,
emphatically—“no
man
more
so
.
<EOS>
But
pardon
me
if
I
say
that
your
claims
upon
me
are
equal
to
those
of
your
much-
<EOS>
honoured
,
much
-
lamented
sire
.
<EOS>
”“You
are
pleased
to
say
so
,
colonel
,
”
observed
the
king
,
“
and
I
thank
you
for
the
assurance
.
<EOS>
But
a
truce
to
claims
real
or
imaginary
!
<EOS>
Allow
me
to
see
the
interior
of
your
mansion
,
which
,
if
it
corresponds
with
the
outside
,
must
be
well
worth
inspection
.
”“‘Tis
<EOS>
a
comfortable
old
house
,
quite
sufficient
for
a
plain
country
gentleman
like
myself
,
sir
<EOS>
,
”
replied
the
colonel
;
“
and
if
I
am
able
to
keep
it
up
<EOS>
I
shall
be
quite
content
.
<EOS>
But
the
fines
and
confiscations
of
the
rogues
in
power
have
wellnigh
ruined
me
.
<EOS>
”“Ay
<EOS>
,
ay
,
we
are
alike
in
misfortune
,
Colonel
Maunsel
,
”
observed
the
king
.
<EOS>
“
You
have
lost
much
—
I
have
lost
all
.
<EOS>
But
better
days
,
I
trust
,
are
in
store
for
both
of
us
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
trust
<EOS>
so
,
sir
,
”
the
old
Cavalier
replied
.
<EOS>
“
But
now
,
I
pray
you
,
deign
to
enter
my
humble
dwelling
.
<EOS>
And
you
,
too
,
gentlemen
,
”
he
added
,
saluting
the
others
.
<EOS>
“
Clavering
,
I
am
right
glad
to
see
thee
,
boy
.
<EOS>
Thy
turn
will
come
anon
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
welcome
thy
father
’s
guests
,
and
show
them
in
.
<EOS>
”So
<EOS>
saying
,
and
respectfully
retiring
before
the
king
,
taking
especial
care
not
to
turn
his
back
upon
his
Majesty
,
the
old
Cavalier
moved
towards
the
house
.
<EOS>
His
master
’s
gestures
were
imitated
by
Martin
Geere
,
but
so
unsuccessfully
,
that
,
in
retreating
somewhat
too
hastily
,
he
came
in
contact
with
the
steps
,
and
tumbled
backwards
,
amidst
the
titters
of
the
rest
of
the
serving
-
men
.
<EOS>
Charles
would
willingly
have
dispensed
with
so
much
ceremony
,
but
aware
of
the
punctilious
character
of
his
host
,
he
did
not
like
to
put
a
stop
to
it
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
he
was
ushered
into
the
house
,
and
compelled
to
take
precedence
of
the
others
,
who
held
back
until
he
had
entered
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
had
Charles
set
foot
in
the
entrance
-
hall
,
than
the
colonel
<EOS>
once
more
gave
him
a
hearty
welcome
to
Ovingdean
Grange
,
to
which
the
king
made
a
suitable
reply
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Beard
then
received
the
honour
of
a
presentation
,
and
his
Majesty
expressing
a
hope
that
he
might
be
speedily
restored
to
the
living
of
which
he
had
been
deprived
,
he
replied
with
humility,“I
do
not
despair
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Vincit
qui
patitur
.
<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
this
,
I
suppose
,
is
your
daughter
,
Mr.
Beard
?
”
<EOS>
inquired
the
king
,
determined
to
put
his
promise
to
Clavering
into
immediate
execution
,
and
looking
with
such
undisguised
admiration
at
Dulcia
as
summoned
the
roses
to
her
cheek
.
<EOS>
“
On
my
faith
,
fair
damsel
,
”
he
continued
,
“
I
have
heard
Clavering
Maunsel
speak
of
you
—
and
in
rapturous
terms
,
I
promise
you
—
but
,
as
I
live
,
his
description
did
not
do
you
justice
.
<EOS>
”“I
must
pray
you
,
sir
,
to
spare
the
maiden
’s
blushes
,
”
interposed
Colonel
Maunsel
.
<EOS>
“
She
is
simple
and
home
-
bred
,
and
unaccustomed
to
compliments
.
<EOS>
”“Egad
!
<EOS>
colonel
,
you
mistake
,
”
cried
the
monarch
;
“
I
never
spoke
with
greater
sincerity
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
Your
son
did
not
say
half
so
much
of
fair
Mistress
Dulcia
as
she
deserves
.
<EOS>
She
is
lovely
enough
to
grace
the
proudest
hall
in
England
—
ay
,
a
palace
,
if
there
be
a
palace
left
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
been
in
Clavering
’s
place
I
should
have
fallen
in
love
to
a
dead
certainty
;
and
if
—
as
perhaps
might
be
the
case
—
the
fair
Dulcia
had
not
proved
altogether
insensible
to
my
suit
,
I
should
have
asked
my
father
’s
consent
,
”
he
added
,
to
the
colonel
.
<EOS>
This
speech
,
as
may
be
imagined
,
greatly
embarrassed
one
person
to
whom
it
referred
,
but
the
king
seemed
wholly
to
disregard
her
confusion
.
<EOS>
“And
what
should
you
have
answered
,
colonel
,
if
such
a
question
had
been
put
to
you
?
”
pursued
Charles
.
<EOS>
“‘Faith
<EOS>
,
sir
,
I
ca
n’t
say
—
<EOS>
I
have
not
given
the
matter
consideration
,
”
replied
the
old
Cavalier
.
<EOS>
“Then
do
so
,
”
rejoined
the
king
;
“
and
decide
before
I
leave
,
for
I
have
made
up
my
mind
that
it
shall
be
a
match
.
<EOS>
”“You
must
have
other
and
more
important
affairs
to
think
of
,
I
should
fancy
,
sir
,
”
remarked
Colonel
Maunsel
,
“
than
to
trouble
yourself
,
at
a
time
like
the
present
,
about
the
loves
of
a
foolish
boy
and
girl
.
<EOS>
If
there
should
be
any
fondness
between
them
—
of
which
I
am
ignorant
—
they
must
wait
.
<EOS>
”“Very
<EOS>
prudent
and
proper
,
”
rejoined
the
king
.
<EOS>
“
Let
them
wait
if
you
desire
it
,
my
good
colonel
,
but
not
too
long
—
not
too
long
.
<EOS>
There
!
<EOS>
we
may
consider
the
matter
as
settled
,
”
he
added
,
with
a
glance
at
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“Upon
my
word
,
sir
<EOS>
,
”
cried
the
colonel
,
“
you
are
very
peremptory
—
and
as
prompt
as
peremptory
.
<EOS>
You
have
only
been
here
a
few
minutes
,
and
yet
have
made
a
marriage
,
whether
the
parties
chiefly
concerned
like
it
or
not
.
”“Oddsfish
!
<EOS>
colonel
,
”
exclaimed
Charles
,
“
I
have
taken
care
to
satisfy
myself
on
that
score
.
<EOS>
Your
consent
alone
is
wanted
,
for
good
Mr.
Beard
<EOS>
’s
,
I
can
see
,
is
given
already
.
<EOS>
”“Nay
,
if
I
thought
the
happiness
of
the
young
folks
was
at
stake
,
”
replied
the
colonel
,
“
I
should
not
withhold
my
consent
,
you
may
depend
,
sir
.
<EOS>
”“I
knew
it!—I
knew
it
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Charles
,
triumphantly
.
<EOS>
“
Bravo
!
bravissimo
!
<EOS>
Clavering
,
I
congratulate
you
.
<EOS>
You
will
soon
have
the
prettiest
wife
in
Sussex
,
and
my
only
regret
is
that
I
can
not
be
present
at
the
wedding
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
colonel
,
before
doing
anything
else
,
I
would
fain
refresh
myself
with
a
little
cold
water
,
and
get
rid
of
the
dust
and
heat
of
the
journey
.
<EOS>
”“I
will
instantly
attend
you
to
a
chamber
,
sir
,
where
all
is
in
readiness
,
”
said
the
old
Cavalier
.
<EOS>
“On
<EOS>
no
account
,
colonel
,
”
cried
the
king
.
<EOS>
“
I
will
not
permit
it
.
<EOS>
You
overwhelm
me
by
your
kindness
.
<EOS>
You
have
other
guests
to
attend
to
besides
myself
.
<EOS>
Clavering
will
show
me
the
way
—
that
is
,
if
he
can
quit
the
side
of
his
intended
.
<EOS>
Come
,
confess
!
”
<EOS>
he
added
,
playfully
,
as
he
approached
the
young
couple
.
<EOS>
“
Have
I
not
done
you
both
a
good
turn?”“In
good
truth
you
have
,
sir
,
”
replied
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“
I
will
answer
for
Dulcia
,
”
he
added
,
as
the
blushing
damsel
turned
away
to
hide
her
confusion
.
<EOS>
“Upstairs
at
once
,
and
away
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Charles
,
“
or
we
shall
have
the
old
gentleman
retract
his
promise
.
<EOS>
”Urged
<EOS>
on
by
the
king
,
who
seemed
determined
to
prevent
any
further
display
of
etiquette
,
Clavering
ran
up
the
grand
staircase
,
while
Charles
followed
with
equal
celerity
,
much
to
the
discomposure
of
Colonel
Maunsel
,
who
thought
that
his
son
ought
to
have
observed
more
ceremony
.
<EOS>
On
being
ushered
into
the
colonel
’s
sleeping
chamber
,
the
king
threw
himself
into
an
elbowchair
and
indulged
in
a
hearty
laugh
.
<EOS>
Clavering
,
meanwhile
,
anxious
to
escape
from
the
raillery
in
which
it
was
evident
that
the
mirthful
young
monarch
was
disposed
to
indulge
at
his
expense
,
proceeded
towards
the
inner
chamber
to
ascertain
that
all
the
necessaries
for
the
king
’s
toilette
were
ready
,
and
finding
that
no
change
of
linen
had
been
placed
there
,
he
begged
leave
to
retire
in
order
to
repair
the
omission
.
<EOS>
Charles
nodded
in
token
of
assent
,
and
Clavering
,
with
a
profound
obeisance
,
quitted
the
room
,
leaving
his
Majesty
still
laughing
heartily
at
the
thoughts
that
tickled
his
fancy
.
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
a
gentle
tap
was
heard
at
the
door
,
and
,
in
reply
to
Charles
’s
summons
to
come
in
,
Patty
Whinchat
entered
,
carrying
with
much
care
a
fine
linen
shirt
with
laced
ruffles
,
and
a
laced
band
of
snowy
whiteness
placed
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Curtseying
to
the
king
,
she
tripped
into
the
inner
room
and
deposited
the
linen
on
the
bed
.
<EOS>
Her
errand
performed
,
Patty
returned
,
and
dropping
another
curtsey
to
the
king
,
observed,“Captain
Clavering
bade
me
say
,
sir
,
that
if
you
have
occasion
for
any
change
of
apparel
,
you
will
find
all
you
require
in
the
wardrobe
.
”“Captain
<EOS>
Clavering
is
very
obliging
,
”
replied
Charles
,
glancing
admiringly
at
her
.
<EOS>
“
How
art
thou
called
,
child
,
and
what
office
dost
fill
in
the
house?”“I
am
named
Patty
Whinchat
,
an
please
you
,
sir
,
”
she
replied
;
“
and
am
handmaiden
to
Mistress
Dulcia
Beard
.
”“Oddsfish
,
Patty
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
king
,
“
thy
<EOS>
good
looks
rival
those
of
thy
mistress
.
<EOS>
Ye
are
both
so
pretty
,
that
if
I
were
asked
which
to
take
I
should
be
fairly
perplexed
in
the
choice
.
<EOS>
”“But
<EOS>
you
are
not
asked
to
take
either
of
us
,
sir
,
”
Patty
rejoined
.
<EOS>
“
My
mistress
has
got
a
lover
,
and
I—”“More
than
one
,
I
’ll
be
sworn
!
”
<EOS>
interrupted
the
king
,
“
or
the
serving
-
men
have
no
taste
.
<EOS>
However
,
there
’ll
be
no
great
harm
in
robbing
your
favoured
and
fortunate
swain
,
whoever
he
may
be
,
of
a
kiss
“
—
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
.
<EOS>
“
You
have
plenty
to
spare
,
both
for
him
and
me
.
<EOS>
”“You
are
mistaken
,
sir
,
”
replied
Patty
;
<EOS>
“
I
should
n’t
have
half
enow
for
Ninian
Saxby
,
if
I
let
him
take
as
many
as
he
wants
.
<EOS>
But
do
n’t
detain
me
,
sir
,
I
pray
of
you
.
<EOS>
I
must
n’t
stay
here
another
minute
.
<EOS>
I
’m
wanted
downstairs
.
<EOS>
Somebody
is
below
,
I
’m
told
,
”
she
added
,
mysteriously
,
“
<EOS>
and
I
’m
dying
to
have
a
peep
at
him
.
<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
who
may
this
‘
somebody
’
be
whom
thou
art
so
curious
to
behold
,
child
?
”
<EOS>
inquired
Charles
.
<EOS>
“The
servants
will
have
it
the
king
is
here
,
”
rejoined
Patty
;
“
but
they
’ve
said
the
same
thing
so
often
before
that
I
do
n’t
exactly
believe
them
.
<EOS>
”“What
<EOS>
sort
of
person
is
the
king
,
child
?
”
said
Charles
.
<EOS>
“
Should
you
know
him
if
you
beheld
him?”“Know
him
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Patty
.
<EOS>
“
To
be
sure
!
<EOS>
the
very
instant
<EOS>
I
clapped
eyes
upon
him
.
<EOS>
”“But
<EOS>
what
is
he
like
?
<EOS>
Remarkably
handsome
,
eh?”“Handsome
!
<EOS>
quite
the
contrary
!
<EOS>
He
’s
remarkably
plain
—
harsh
features
,
and
very
dark
.
<EOS>
Mercy
on
us
!
<EOS>
if
it
should—”“Why
,
what
’s
the
matter
,
child?”“If
it
should
be
the
king
whom
I
’ve
been
talking
to
all
the
time
!
”
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
trembling
.
<EOS>
“If
<EOS>
it
were
the
king
<EOS>
,
I
’ll
answer
for
it
<EOS>
he
would
be
the
last
person
to
be
offended
with
so
pretty
a
lass
as
thyself
,
”
said
Charles
,
reassuring
her
with
another
kiss
.
<EOS>
“
But
hie
thee
downstairs
,
and
thou
mayst
possibly
find
out
some
one
who
will
better
answer
to
thy
notions
of
what
a
monarch
ought
to
be
than
myself
.
<EOS>
”Patty
<EOS>
then
curtseyed
and
moved
towards
the
door
,
but
she
could
not
help
casting
another
look
at
the
king
ere
she
quitted
the
room
,
exclaiming,“Oh
,
if
it
should
be
his
Majesty
,
I
shall
never
get
over
it!”Much
diverted
by
the
incident
,
Charles
went
into
the
inner
room
,
and
before
proceeding
to
disrobe
himself
,
placed
his
rapier
and
the
brace
of
pocket-
pistols
,
which
he
usually
carried
with
him
,
on
a
table
set
near
the
arras
curtain
hung
between
the
two
rooms
.
<EOS>
His
ablutions
performed
,
he
next
exchanged
his
travel-
soiled
undergarments
for
the
fair
linen
provided
by
Patty
,
humming
the
while
some
snatches
of
a
then
popular
French
romance
.
<EOS>
“Egad
!
”
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
taking
up
the
doublet
he
had
just
laid
aside
,
this
is
a
very
comfortable
old
house
,
and
I
should
have
been
quite
as
well
lodged
here
as
at
Trent
—
and
well
cared
for
,
moreover
,
by
the
pretty
little
Phillis
who
has
just
left
me
.
<EOS>
For
many
reasons
I
am
glad
I
am
here
,
though
Wilmot
would
fain
have
dissuaded
me
from
doing
soon
the
score
of
danger
!
<EOS>
Pshaw
!
<EOS>
no
danger
is
to
be
apprehended
—
at
all
events
,
not
to
-
day
—
and
to
-
morrow
his
enemies
will
look
in
vain
for
Charles
Stuart
.
<EOS>
Hang
these
Puritanical
garments
,
”
he
added
,
throwing
down
the
jerkin
in
disgust
,
“
I
abominate
them
.
<EOS>
Let
us
see
what
this
wardrobe
contains
.
<EOS>
A
doublet
of
Clavering
’s
might
suit
me
.
”
<EOS>
With
this
he
opened
the
door
of
the
wardrobe
,
and
taking
out
a
handsome
suit
of
black
taffeta
,
exclaimed
,
“
<EOS>
Oddsfish
!
<EOS>
these
are
the
very
things
.
<EOS>
”With
<EOS>
this
,
he
proceeded
to
array
himself
in
the
,
new
-
found
apparel
,
which
fitted
him
to
admiration
,
and
was
adjusting
his
laced
band
before
a
mirror
set
in
a
frame
of
black
oak
,
when
the
arras
curtain
was
suddenly
drawn
aside
,
and
two
men
,
whose
appearance
and
looks
left
him
no
doubt
of
their
intentions
,
stepped
from
behind
it
.

CHAPTER
<EOS>
IXHow
The
King
<EOS>
Was
Shut
Up
In
The
Hiding
-
PlaceIT
is
scarcely
necessary
to
say
that
the
menacing
intruders
who
surprised
Charles
at
his
toilette
were
Stelfax
and
Micklegift
.
<EOS>
The
Ironside
leader
’s
first
act
was
to
possess
himself
of
the
pistols
and
rapier
,
which
the
king
had
incautiously
laid
upon
the
table
,
and
deliver
them
to
his
companion
.
<EOS>
“Ha
!
<EOS>
betrayed
!

<EOS>
exclaimed
Charles
,
springing
towards
the
table
in
search
of
his
arms
,
and
perceiving
to
his
dismay
that
they
were
gone
.
<EOS>
Even
in
this
extremity
he
did
not
lose
his
self
-
possession
,
but
eyed
his
foes
resolutely
and
even
haughtily
.
<EOS>
“What
makes
you
here
?
”
<EOS>
he
sternly
demanded
.
<EOS>
“I
am
here
to
arrest
thee
,
Charles
Stuart
,
in
the
name
of
the
Parliament
of
England
,
and
by
order
of
his
Excellency
the
Lord
General
Cromwell
.
<EOS>
Surrender
thyself
my
prisoner
—
rescue
or
no
rescue
—
or
I
will
shoot
thee
through
the
head
.
”“Beware
<EOS>
ere
<EOS>
thou
liftest
thine
hand
against
the
Lord
’s
anointed
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Charles
,
with
a
look
and
gesture
so
full
of
majesty
that
it
inspired
awe
in
both
his
hearers
,
and
the
Ironside
captain
involuntarily
lowered
the
pistol
which
he
had
levelled
at
the
king
.
<EOS>
Charles
instantly
perceived
the
slight
advantage
he
had
gained
,
and
sought
to
profit
by
it
.
<EOS>
If
he
could
only
gain
time
,
he
thought
,
assistance
might
arrive
.
<EOS>
He
glanced
around
to
see
if
there
was
a
hand
-
bell
within
reach
,
a
whistle
,
or
any
other
means
of
giving
the
alarm
.
<EOS>
But
nothing
presented
itself
.
<EOS>
“For
<EOS>
the
second
time
,
I
ask
thee
,
Charles
Stuart
,
”
said
Stelfax
,
“
dost
thou
yield
thyself
a
prisoner
,
or
wilt
thou
compel
me
to
lay
violent
hands
upon
thy
person?”“Off
,
villains
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
king
,
retreating
a
few
paces
.
<EOS>
“
Touch
me
at
your
peril
.
<EOS>
I
will
resist
to
the
death
.
”“Be
<EOS>
ruled
by
my
counsel
,
O
insensate
young
man
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Micklegift
.
<EOS>
“
Resistance
is
useless
,
and
will
bring
instant
destruction
upon
thee
.
<EOS>
Yield
thee
to
what
can
not
be
averted
,
and
submit
patiently
to
the
decrees
of
Heaven
.
<EOS>
”“Heaven
<EOS>
hath
never
decreed
that
I
shall
perish
by
such
base
hands
as
those
of
thy
comrade
!
”
<EOS>
cried
the
king
.
<EOS>
“Better
<EOS>
for
thee
thou
shouldst
die
by
my
hands
than
by
those
of
the
headsman
,
like
thy
tyrannous
father
,
”
retorted
Stelfax
.
<EOS>
“
For
the
last
time
,
I
ask
thee
,
dost
thou
yield
thyself
a
prisoner?”Charles
seemed
to
have
taken
a
sudden
resolution
.
<EOS>
“Since
it
can
not
be
helped
,
I
yield
<EOS>
,
”
he
said
;
“
but
I
couple
my
surrender
with
no
promise
.
<EOS>
Keep
guard
over
me
as
best
ye
may
,
I
will
escape
if
I
can
.
<EOS>
”Stelfax
made
no
reply
,
but
signed
to
the
monarch
to
come
forth
into
the
outer
room
.
<EOS>
Charles
obeyed
,
and
marched
towards
his
captors
with
great
dignity
and
unshaken
firmness
,
secretly
wondering
what
they
meant
to
do
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
long
kept
in
suspense
.
<EOS>
They
were
now
in
the
centre
of
the
chamber
,
and
Stelfax
directed
his
companion
to
open
the
door
of
the
hiding
-
place
.
<EOS>
“
Thou
know’st
the
secret
spring
,
”
he
said—“touch
<EOS>
it
,
I
prithee
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
quit
the
prisoner
,
even
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
”Micklegift
did
as
he
was
enjoined
,
pressed
his
hand
upon
the
little
knob
that
moved
the
pillar
,
and
the
aperture
was
disclosed
.
<EOS>
“Enter
<EOS>
that
hiding
-
place
,
Charles
Stuart
,
”
said
Stelfax
,
sternly
,
to
the
king
.
<EOS>
“
It
was
contrived
for
thy
fugitive
followers
,
and
may
therefore
serve
thy
turn
.
<EOS>
‘
Tis
in
vain
to
dispute
my
authority
.
<EOS>
I
am
thy
master
now
,
by
right
of
the
sword
,
”
he
added
,
presenting
his
rapier
’s
point
at
the
king
’s
breast
,
“
and
will
be
obeyed
.
<EOS>
Enter
,
I
command
thee!”Charles
had
no
alternative
but
compliance
.
<EOS>
A
struggle
,
under
such
disadvantageous
circumstances
,
must
have
cost
him
his
life
.
<EOS>
“Plague
take
‘
em
!
”
<EOS>
he
muttered
,
as
he
went
into
the
hiding-
place
.
<EOS>
“
What
the
deuce
can
they
all
be
about
downstairs
,
to
allow
me
to
be
trapped
in
this
manner
?
<EOS>
Will
no
one
come
to
the
rescue?”But
<EOS>
as
rescue
came
not
,
he
went
in
.
<EOS>
Stelfax
quickly
followed
,
but
,
ere
he
passed
quite
through
the
aperture
,
he
called
out
to
Micklegift:“Hie
thee
back
as
quickly
as
thou
canst
to
Morefruit
Stone
’s
cottage
.
<EOS>
Dispatch
him
with
all
haste
to
Lewes
for
my
men
.
<EOS>
Then
return
to
this
chamber
,
and
if
nought
has
happened
in
the
interval
,
tap
thrice
against
these
boards
.
<EOS>
I
shall
know
thy
signal
,
and
will
come
forth
.
<EOS>
The
Lord
hath
delivered
Abijam
into
my
hands
at
last
,
and
he
shall
never
quit
them
with
life!”So
saying
,
he
closed
the
door
of
the
hiding
place
.
<EOS>
Micklegift
then
passed
through
a
small
door
in
the
inner
chamber
,
partially
concealed
by
arras
,
through
which
he
and
Stelfax
had
obtained
admittance
.
<EOS>
This
outlet
communicated
with
a
back
staircase
,
which
the
Independent
minister
hastily
descended
.
<EOS>
At
the
foot
of
the
staircase
was
a
postern
,
which
let
him
out
into
the
garden
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
<EOS>
XThe
Puritan
’s
DaughterNOT
<EOS>
many
minutes
after
the
king
’s
immurement
in
the
hiding
-
place
,
Clavering
tapped
at
the
chamber
door
,
and
receiving
no
answer
,
though
he
repeated
the
application
yet
more
loudly
,
ventured
to
enter
the
apartment
.
<EOS>
Pausing
for
a
moment
in
the
outer
chamber
,
and
coughing
slightly
to
announce
his
presence
,
he
went
on
,
and
was
both
surprised
and
alarmed
not
to
perceive
the
king
.
<EOS>
Remarking
,
however
,
that
his
Majesty
had
changed
his
attire
,
and
that
the
small
door
communicating
with
the
back
staircase
was
left
partly
open
,
he
concluded
Charles
must
have
discovered
that
means
of
exit
,
and
had
probably
found
his
way
to
the
garden
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
this
conviction
,
however
,
he
could
not
shake
off
a
strong
feeling
of
uneasiness
,
and
resolving
to
satisfy
himself
without
delay
,
quickly
descended
the
winding
staircase
and
reached
the
postern
at
its
foot
,
which
he
found
unlocked
.
<EOS>
The
latter
circumstance
convinced
him
that
he
was
right
in
his
conjecture
,
and
he
now
felt
certain
of
finding
his
Majesty
in
the
garden
.
<EOS>
But
though
he
visited
every
walk
,
alley
,
and
labyrinth
,
he
was
unsuccessful
,
and
all
his
alarm
returned
,
and
with
additional
force
.
<EOS>
One
hope
alone
sustained
him
.
<EOS>
The
king
—
though
this
appeared
highly
improbable
—
might
have
strayed
into
the
orchard
,
or
the
holt
beyond
it
.
<EOS>
To
the
orchard
he
flew
at
once
,
and
had
scarcely
opened
the
gate
leading
to
it
when
he
encountered
old
Ticehurst
,
the
gardener
,
and
Nut
Springett
.
<EOS>
In
answer
to
his
inquiries
,
Ticehurst
stated
that
about
five
minutes
ago
he
had
seen
a
tall
,
dark
man
,
answering
to
the
description
of
the
person
Captain
Clavering
was
inquiring
about
,
issue
from
the
postern
,
and
pass
out
at
the
gate
in
the
north
wall
near
Morefruit
Stone
’s
cottage
.
<EOS>
Still
more
perplexed
,
but
thinking
this
must
be
the
king
,
though
he
was
wholly
unable
to
account
for
such
imprudence
on
his
Majesty
’s
part
,
Clavering
hurried
off
in
the
direction
taken
by
the
person
whom
the
gardeners
had
seen
,
and
passed
through
the
gate
referred
to
by
them
.
<EOS>
Not
fifty
yards
off
,
and
shaded
by
a
fine
elm
-
tree
,
stood
Morefruit
Stone
’s
cottage
.
<EOS>
Great
was
his
surprise
,
on
entering
it
,
to
find
Increase
Micklegift
in
the
hands
of
John
Habergeon
and
Ninian
Saxby
.
<EOS>
The
only
person
in
the
cottage
,
besides
the
Independent
minister
and
his
captors
,
was
Morefruit
Stone
’s
daughter
,
Temperance
,
a
comely
damsel
,
to
whom
Ninian
had
once
paid
considerable
attention
.
<EOS>
Instantly
divining
that
treachery
had
been
practised
by
Micklegift
,
Clavering
drew
his
sword
,
and
placing
its
point
at
the
other
’s
throat
,
demanded
,
in
a
terrible
voice,“What
hast
thou
done
with
him
?
<EOS>
Where
is
he?”“Harm
me
,
and
thou
shalt
never
learn
,
”
replied
the
Independent
minister
,
composedly
.
<EOS>
“Let
<EOS>
us
take
him
to
the
house
at
once
,
captain
,
and
examine
him
there
,
”
said
John
Habergeon
.
<EOS>
“
He
has
important
revelations
to
make
.
<EOS>
I
warrant
we
will
find
means
of
making
him
speak
.
<EOS>
”“Try
!
”
<EOS>
rejoined
Micklegift
,
with
a
look
of
cold
contempt
.
<EOS>
“Ay
,
we
will
try
,
and
to
some
purpose
,
presently
,
I
warrant
thee
,
”
rejoined
John
.
<EOS>
“
We
will
question
thee
with
the
thumbscrew
and
the
scourge
,
after
Captain
Stelfax
’s
fashion
.
<EOS>
”“How
came
you
to
find
the
villain
here
?
”
<EOS>
inquired
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“We
received
our
information
from
pretty
Temperance
Stone
,
”
said
Ninian
,
with
a
grateful
look
at
the
damsel
in
question
;
“
<EOS>
and
I
shall
not
soon
forget
the
service
she
has
done
us
.
<EOS>
”“Woe
to
her
!
<EOS>
for
she
hath
betrayed
her
father
and
her
father
’s
friend
,
”
said
Micklegift
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
“
Her
love
for
this
vain
youth
shall
never
prosper
.
<EOS>
”“That
is
more
than
you
can
answer
for
,
rascal
,
”
replied
Ninian
.
<EOS>
“Where
is
her
father
?
”
<EOS>
demanded
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“He
<EOS>
hath
escaped
from
the
hands
of
these
Philistines
,
”
said
Micklegift
,
with
a
look
of
triumph
,
“
and
will
yet
bring
the
enemy
upon
you
.
<EOS>
”“Be
<EOS>
not
alarmed
,
sir
,
”
replied
John
Habergeon
.
<EOS>
“
<EOS>
He
hath
started
for
Lewes
,
but
he
can
not
have
gone
far
.
<EOS>
Eustace
Saxby
is
upon
his
track
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
there
are
others
on
the
look
-
out
,
whose
vigilance
he
will
find
it
difficult
to
elude
.
<EOS>
”“I
have
not
told
all
I
know
,
”
said
Temperance
;
“
but
since
I
am
provoked
,
I
will
withhold
nothing
.
”
<EOS>
And
she
then
proceeded
to
relate
to
Clavering
that
Micklegift
and
Stelfax
were
concealed
in
her
father
’s
cottage
as
he
had
passed
on
his
way
with
the
other
gentlemen
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
That
one
of
the
party
had
been
recognized
by
the
two
men
,
who
declared
it
was
the
Young
Man
.
<EOS>
That
Stelfax
then
declared
that
at
all
hazards
he
would
obtain
admission
to
the
house
and
accomplish
his
arrest
,
and
Micklegift
agreed
to
accompany
him
,
telling
him
he
knew
a
way
by
which
they
could
obtain
secret
admission
to
the
colonel
’s
sleeping
chamber
.
<EOS>
“The
colonel
’s
sleeping
chamber
,
damsel
—
art
<EOS>
sure
he
mentioned
that
room
?
”
demanded
John
Habergeon
.
<EOS>
“
If
so
,
they
must
have
gained
admission
by
the
postern
opening
from
the
back
stairs
into
the
garden
.
<EOS>
”“They
<EOS>
did
so
,
”
replied
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“
But
how
came
the
door
open?”A
scornful
smile
lighted
up
Micklegift
’s
sallow
features
.
<EOS>
“He
hath
a
master
-
key
,
no
doubt
<EOS>
,
”
replied
Temperance
,
“
for
he
unlocked
the
garden
-
gate
,
and
they
went
in
together
.
<EOS>
Feeling
sure
some
great
mischief
was
afoot
,
I
made
an
excuse
to
quit
the
cottage
,
and
hastened
in
search
of
Ninian
,
whom
I
found
with
his
father
and
John
Habergeon
,
and
told
him
what
had
happened
,
and
they
all
three
came
back
with
me
.
<EOS>
”“We
<EOS>
saw
Micklegift
from
a
distance
enter
the
cottage
,
”
said
Ninian
,
“
and
pounced
upon
him
before
he
was
aware
.
<EOS>
And
here
we
have
him
safe
enough
,
as
you
see
,
to
answer
for
his
offences
.
<EOS>
”“But
<EOS>
where
is
Stelfax
?
”
exclaimed
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“
Where
is—”“The
Young
Man
Charles
Stuart
thou
wouldst
say
,
”
supplied
Micklegift
.
<EOS>
“
Neither
of
them
wilt
thou
find
till
it
be
too
late
.
”“Villain
,
I
will
force
thee
to
disclose
where
the
king
is
!
”
<EOS>
cried
Clavering
,
with
a
look
of
distraction—“I
will
tear
the
secret
from
thy
breast
.
<EOS>
”“Hold
<EOS>
,
your
honour
!
”
exclaimed
John
.
<EOS>
“
I
think
I
have
discovered
it
.
<EOS>
Where
was
the
king
<EOS>
last
seen?”“I
left
him
alone
to
attire
himself
in
my
father
’s
sleeping
chamber
,
”
replied
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“Then
,
depend
upon
it
he
is
shut
up
in
the
hiding
-
place
,
and
Stelfax
is
there
with
him
,
”
cried
John
.
<EOS>
“A
shrewd
guess
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“
I
can
see
from
this
rascal
’s
looks
that
thou
art
in
the
right
.
<EOS>
Bring
him
along
!
<EOS>
We
must
not
lose
a
moment
in
setting
our
royal
master
free
.
<EOS>
”“Hold
<EOS>
yet
a
moment
,
and
listen
to
me
,
”
said
Micklegift
.
<EOS>
“
I
will
not
deny
that
you
have
hit
upon
the
truth
,
for
it
is
vain
to
attempt
further
concealment
.
<EOS>
But
ye
can
not
liberate
Charles
Stuart
without
my
aid
.
<EOS>
Stelfax
will
slay
his
prisoner
rather
than
yield
him
to
you
.
<EOS>
Such
I
know
to
be
his
purpose
,
and
ye
are
acquainted
with
his
determined
character
.
<EOS>
Promise
to
do
me
no
injury
,
and
I
will
avert
this
direful
catastrophe
,
which
will
otherwise
inevitably
ensue
.
<EOS>
”Clavering
<EOS>
reflected
for
a
moment
,
and
then
replied
,
“
I
give
thee
the
promise
thou
requirest
.
<EOS>
Bring
him
along
.
<EOS>
”“Nay
,
there
will
be
no
need
to
use
force
,
”
said
Micklegift
.
<EOS>
“
I
will
go
peaceably
enough
.
<EOS>
”“You
must
come
with
us
too
,
fair
mistress
,
”
said
Ninian
to
Temperance
.
<EOS>
“
We
can
not
leave
you
behind
.
<EOS>
”“I
have
no
desire
to
be
left
,
”
replied
the
blushing
maiden
,
displaying
great
readiness
to
accompany
him
.
<EOS>
The
whole
party
then
quitted
the
cottage
.
<EOS>
Micklegift
marched
between
John
and
Ninian
,
who
,
notwithstanding
their
captive
’s
promise
to
go
quietly
,
thought
it
right
to
keep
firm
hold
of
him
.
<EOS>
In
this
manner
they
crossed
the
garden
and
proceeded
to
the
little
postern

CHAPTER
XIIn
<EOS>
Which
The
Tables
Are
Turned
Upon
StelfaxA
PRISONER
in
a
narrow
cell
,
with
an
inexorable
gaoler
close
beside
him
,
and
ready
to
slay
him
if
he
attempted
escape
,
Charles
did
not
lose
his
confidence
.
<EOS>
Deliverance
<EOS>
he
felt
sure
would
come
.
<EOS>
His
absence
must
be
ere
long
discovered
by
the
inmates
of
the
house
,
and
then
search
would
be
made
for
him
,
and
it
was
scarcely
probable
that
this
hiding
-
place
,
of
which
he
himself
had
heard
Clavering
speak
,
would
remain
unvisited
.
<EOS>
Still
,
great
risk
might
be
incurred
at
the
moment
when
his
liberation
should
be
attempted
,
and
he
tried
to
consider
what
ought
to
be
done
at
that
hazardous
conjuncture
.
<EOS>
Leaning
against
the
wall
of
the
cell
,
he
assumed
a
perfectly
indifferent
air
,
and
began
to
hum
snatches
of
French
ditties
,
as
he
had
previously
done
while
making
his
toilette
.
<EOS>
This
show
of
gaiety
and
unconcern
was
so
annoying
to
Stelfax
,
that
he
at
last
sternly
rebuked
him
for
his
unseemly
levity
.
<EOS>
“Would
<EOS>
you
prefer
that
I
should
join
you
in
a
hymn
,
captain
?
”
said
Charles
.
<EOS>
“
Lead
on
,
and
I
will
accompany
you
.
”“Trouble
<EOS>
me
not
,
thou
vain
young
man
,
but
keep
silence
,
”
rejoined
Stelfax
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
The
careless
monarch
was
not
,
however
,
to
be
checked
,
but
went
on
humming
his
songs
in
spite
of
his
moody
gaoler
.
<EOS>
In
this
manner
nearly
half
an
hour
passed
away
.
<EOS>
Charles
then
began
to
find
the
confinement
irksome
,
and
asked
,
with
some
impatience
,
how
long
he
was
to
be
kept
there
?
<EOS>
Stelfax
made
no
reply
,
but
the
next
moment
the
attention
of
both
was
caught
by
a
slight
sound
—
a
tap
against
the
piece
of
wood
screening
the
entrance
to
the
recess
.
<EOS>
Charles
started
,
but
controlled
himself
by
a
great
effort
.
<EOS>
Was
relief
come
?
<EOS>
Or
was
it
the
aid
expected
by
Stelfax?The
Ironside
captain
likewise
listened
attentively
,
and
not
without
anxiety
.
<EOS>
The
tap
was
repeated
;
and
again
,
after
a
pause
,
for
the
third
time
.
<EOS>
There
could
be
no
doubt
now
.
<EOS>
It
was
Micklegift
.
<EOS>
Sternly
enjoining
the
king
to
follow
him
,
Stelfax
moved
forward
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
the
secret
spring
was
touched
,
the
door
of
the
recess
flew
open
,
and
the
voice
of
the
Independent
minister
was
heard
to
call
out
,
“
<EOS>
It
is
I
,
Increase
Micklegift
.
<EOS>
Come
forth
without
fear
.
<EOS>
”Addressing
another
stern
injunction
to
the
king
to
follow
him
,
Stelfax
drew
a
pistol
from
his
belt
,
and
grasping
his
bared
sword
in
his
left
hand
,
to
be
ready
for
instant
service
if
required
,
stepped
out
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
Micklegift
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
chamber
,
almost
opposite
the
fireplace
,
and
,
on
seeing
Stelfax
,
signed
to
him
to
follow
him
to
the
inner
room
,
moving
quickly
in
that
direction
himself
.
<EOS>
“Stay
!
”
<EOS>
vociferated
Stelfax
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
“
Whither
goest
thou
?
<EOS>
I
may
need
thy
aid
with
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
”Glancing
<EOS>
backwards
as
he
spoke
,
to
ascertain
whether
Charles
was
following
,
he
caught
sight
of
two
men
lurking
within
the
angle
of
the
chimney
-
piece
,
ready
to
spring
upon
him
.
<EOS>
“Ah
!
<EOS>
treacherous
dog
,
thou
hast
played
me
false
!
”
<EOS>
he
vociferated
.
<EOS>
“
But
thou
shalt
not
escape
punishment
!
”
<EOS>
With
which
words
he
fired
his
pistol
at
the
Independent
minister
,
and
with
fatal
effect
.
<EOS>
Micklegift
uttered
a
cry
,
staggered
,
and
fell
backwards
.
<EOS>
“
Neither
shalt
thou
escape
!
”
<EOS>
he
continued
,
turning
to
attack
the
king
,
who
at
this
moment
appeared
at
the
entrance
of
the
recess
;
but
ere
<EOS>
he
could
execute
his
purpose
,
or
indeed
turn
completely
round
,
John
Habergeon
had
thrown
himself
upon
him
,
and
,
aided
by
Ninian
,
succeeded
in
disarming
him
.
<EOS>
Charles
himself
was
close
at
hand
,
but
did
not
interfere
in
the
struggle
,
seeing
his
assistance
was
wholly
unneeded
.
<EOS>
Clavering
had
also
sprung
,
sword
in
hand
,
from
behind
a
piece
of
furniture
;
but
ere
he
could
reach
the
scene
of
action
the
seizure
of
the
redoubted
Ironside
leader
was
accomplished
,
and
all
that
was
left
for
the
young
man
to
do
was
to
congratulate
his
Majesty
on
his
deliverance
.
<EOS>
But
there
were
others
,
as
it
presently
appeared
,
who
were
equally
anxious
to
express
their
feelings
of
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
The
arras
curtain
was
drawn
aside
,
and
from
the
inner
room
issued
a
number
of
persons
,
who
had
been
anxiously
awaiting
the
result
of
Micklegift
’s
device
,
which
,
though
successful
as
far
as
the
king
’s
<EOS>
safety
was
concerned
,
had
proved
disastrous
to
himself
.
<EOS>
No
one
,
however
,
troubled
himself
about
the
luckless
Independent
minister
for
the
moment
.
<EOS>
He
was
left
to
lie
where
he
had
fallen
.
<EOS>
All
the
attention
was
directed
towards
the
king
.
<EOS>
The
party
now
flocking
towards
him
,
which
consisted
of
Colonel
Maunsel
,
Lord
Wilmot
,
Colonel
Philips
,
with
Mr.
Beard
and
his
daughter
,
together
with
old
Martin
Geere
,
were
enthusiastic
in
their
demonstrations
of
joy
.
<EOS>
Concealment
was
no
longer
possible
,
neither
was
it
attempted
.
<EOS>
Charles
was
now
recognized
by
all
as
their
sovereign
.
<EOS>
Bending
the
knee
before
the
monarch
,
Colonel
Maunsel
took
the
hand
which
his
Majesty
graciously
extended
towards
him
,
and
gave
utterance
to
his
unbounded
feelings
of
delight
,
while
the
rest
,
completely
carried
away
by
enthusiasm
,
made
the
roof
echo
with
their
loyal
shouts
of
“
God
save
King
Charles!”Much
touched
by
this
exhibition
of
their
loyalty
,
Charles
,
as
soon
as
he
could
obtain
silence
,
thanked
them
for
their
zeal
,
in
accents
betraying
the
depth
of
his
emotion
,
and
attesting
his
sincerity
.
<EOS>
But
another
matter
now
claimed
the
king
’s
attention
.
<EOS>
One
of
his
enemies
was
gone
to
his
account
,
but
the
more
dangerous
of
the
two
was
left
,
to
expiate
his
offences
with
his
life
.
<EOS>
Charles
prepared
to
pass
judgment
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Disarmed
,
with
his
elbows
tightly
pinioned
to
his
side
by
a
sword
-
belt
,
having
a
guard
on
either
hand
ready
to
stab
him
or
shoot
him
if
he
attempted
resistance
—
which
,
indeed
,
in
his
present
state
,
was
wellnigh
impossible
—
<EOS>
the
Ironside
captain
,
who
refused
to
move
at
John
Habergeon
’s
bidding
,
was
forcibly
dragged
before
the
king
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Charles
having
seated
himself
in
a
richly
carved
oak
chair
,
high-
backed
,
and
provided
with
a
cushion
of
Utrecht
velvet
,
placed
his
foot
on
a
stool
covered
with
the
same
material
,
which
was
set
before
him
with
the
most
profound
respect
by
old
Martin
Geere
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
the
company
stationed
themselves
on
either
side
of
the
chair
occupied
by
his
Majesty
,
thus
giving
the
group
some
slight
resemblance
to
a
gathering
round
the
throne
.
<EOS>
On
the
right
of
the
king
,
and
close
to
the
royal
chair
,
stood
Colonel
Maunsel
leaning
on
his
drawn
sword
.
<EOS>
On
the
same
side
were
Lord
Wilmot
and
Colonel
Philips
.
<EOS>
On
the
left
stood
Clavering
,
with
his
rapier
bared
,
and
held
with
its
point
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Near
to
Clavering
were
Dulcia
and
Mr.
Beard
.
<EOS>
At
some
little
distance
,
near
the
inner
room
,
was
a
group
,
consisting
of
Giles
Moppett
,
Elias
Crundy
,
and
others
of
the
household
,
together
with
Patty
Whinchat
and
Temperance
Stone
.
<EOS>
When
Stelfax
was
brought
before
the
king
,
John
Habergeon
would
fain
have
compelled
him
to
make
an
obeisance
,
but
the
stubborn
Republican
refused
,
and
,
drawing
himself
up
,
said
,
“
I
will
not
bow
the
head
to
the
son
of
the
tyrant
.
<EOS>
”“Let
him
be
,
”
said
Charles
.
<EOS>
“
It
is
too
late
to
teach
him
manners
.
<EOS>
What
hast
thou
to
say
,
fellow
,
”
he
continued
,
addressing
the
prisoner
,
“
why
I
should
not
order
thee
to
instant
execution?”“Nothing
,
”
replied
Stelfax
,
resolutely
.
<EOS>
“
I
am
prepared
to
die
.
<EOS>
A
soldier
of
the
Lord
would
scorn
to
ask
life
from
the
son
of
Rehoboam
.
<EOS>
”“Thy
life
is
justly
forfeited
,
”
said
the
king
.
<EOS>
“
Thou
hast
compassed
my
destruction
,
and
hast
lifted
thy
sacrilegious
hand
against
the
Lord
’s
anointed
;
but
it
was
not
Heaven
’s
will
that
I
should
thus
perish
.
”“It
<EOS>
may
be
thou
art
reserved
to
be
a
scourge
to
the
land
like
thy
father
,
”
said
Stelfax
;
“
but
if
there
are
any
left
of
my
mind
,
thy
reign
will
be
short
,
and
thy
end
bloody
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
pray
your
Majesty
give
no
further
hearing
to
the
rebellious
villain
,
”
said
John
Habergeon
.
<EOS>
“
Let
us
take
him
forth
,
and
deal
with
him
as
his
crimes
deserve
.
<EOS>
We
will
first
strike
off
the
hand
which
he
hath
impiously
raised
against
your
sacred
person
.
<EOS>
”Ere
<EOS>
Charles
could
give
his
consent
to
the
solicitation
,
Dulcia
stepped
forward
,
and
threw
herself
at
his
feet
.
<EOS>
In
this
supplicating
posture
she
lifted
up
her
hands
,
and
said
,
in
accents
of
the
most
earnest
entreaty
,
“
Beseech
your
Majesty
,
cut
not
off
the
man
’s
life
thus
suddenly
.
<EOS>
Give
him
time
for
repentance
.
<EOS>
”“He
<EOS>
is
a
soldier
,
lady
,
”
replied
the
king
,
gravely
,
“
and
,
as
such
,
should
be
prepared
to
die
.
<EOS>
We
see
no
reason
why
delay
should
be
granted
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
given
none
to
ourself
.
<EOS>
Yet
he
shall
have
time
for
prayer
.
<EOS>
See
that
it
be
so
,
good
fellow
,
”
he
added
to
John
Habergeon
.
<EOS>
“I
will
go
with
him
,
and
strive
to
bring
him
to
repentance
,
said
Mr.
Beard
.
<EOS>
“I
do
not
desire
thy
presence
,
”
said
Stelfax
sternly
.
<EOS>
“
I
can
make
up
my
account
with
Heaven
without
thy
aid
.
<EOS>
Yon
hypocritical
traitor
,
whom
I
have
dispatched
before
me
,
”
he
added
,
looking
towards
the
body
of
Micklegift
,
“
hath
disgusted
me
with
all
who
profess
the
sacred
calling
.
<EOS>
”“What
!
<EOS>
hast
thou
<EOS>
no
repentance
for
the
bloody
deed
thou
hast
done
?
”
demanded
the
clergyman
.
<EOS>
“Wherefore
<EOS>
should
I
repent
?
”
<EOS>
rejoined
Stelfax
.
<EOS>
“
The
man
was
justly
slain
.
<EOS>
He
had
betrayed
me
.
”“There
<EOS>
thou
art
wrong
,
”
remarked
John
Rabergeon
.
<EOS>
“
Micklegift
was
a
captive
in
our
hands
,
and
we
compelled
him
to
lure
thee
forth
,
in
order
to
prevent
harm
being
done
by
thee
to
his
Majesty
.
<EOS>
”“And
<EOS>
well
was
it
for
Charles
Stuart
that
ye
employed
the
device
,
”
remarked
Stelfax
.
<EOS>
“
If
that
bullet
had
not
been
wasted
on
the
fool
Micklegift
,
it
would
have
been
lodged
in
your
king
’s
brain
.
<EOS>
Well
was
it
also
for
Charles
Stuart
that
he
came
to
this
house
<EOS>
ere
<EOS>
I
was
prepared
for
him
.
<EOS>
Had
he
tarried
till
to-
morrow
,
his
escape
had
been
impossible
.
<EOS>
”“My
<EOS>
warning
,
you
see
,
was
not
in
vain
,
”
observed
the
king
to
Clavering
.
<EOS>
Again
Dulcia
interceded
for
Stelfax
,
imploring
his
Majesty
not
to
doom
him
to
instant
death
.
<EOS>
“You
seem
to
have
an
interest
more
than
ordinary
in
this
man
,
young
lady
,
”
said
Charles
.
<EOS>
“
Whence
arises
it
?
<EOS>
Speak
frankly
,
if
you
desire
to
serve
him
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
owe
him
some
gratitude
,
my
liege
,
”
replied
Dulcia
,
“
inasmuch
as
he
respected
me
when
I
was
in
his
power
.
<EOS>
While
detained
as
a
prisoner
with
my
father
at
Lewes
,
Captain
Stelfax
sought
to
win
my
love
,
but
by
honourable
means
alone
,
and
finding
at
length
that
his
suit
was
hopeless
,
he
generously
—
nay
,
I
must
use
the
word
,
sire
—
he
generously
set
my
father
and
myself
at
liberty
.
<EOS>
”“This
is
true
,
my
gracious
liege
,
”
said
Mr.
Beard
.
<EOS>
“
As
my
daughter
hath
stated
,
we
were
both
in
his
hands
for
nigh
three
weeks
,
and
were
treated
by
him
with
much
respect
—
nay
,
with
kindness
.
<EOS>
”“I
am
bound
also
to
add
my
testimony
to
that
already
given
,
that
the
man
showed
me
much
personal
consideration
,
and
detained
me
not
when
I
surrendered
myself
to
him
at
Lewes
,
”
said
Colonel
Maunsel
.
<EOS>
“Oddsfish
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
good
-
natured
monarch
,
“
the
knave
seems
to
have
some
better
qualities
than
might
be
expected
.
<EOS>
And
so
you
intercede
for
him
,
eh
,
fair
mistress?”“Earnestly
—
most
earnestly
,
”
cried
Dulcia
.
<EOS>
“And
you
too
,
worthy
sir
?
”
continued
the
king
,
turning
to
Mr.
Beard
.
<EOS>
“As
earnestly
as
my
child
,
sire
,
”
the
good
clergyman
replied
.
<EOS>
“And
what
says
Colonel
Maunsel
?
”
<EOS>
cried
Charles
,
looking
at
the
old
Cavalier
.
<EOS>
“Nay
,
my
liege
,
I
know
not
what
to
say
,
”
rejoined
the
colonel
,
with
a
look
of
perplexity
.
<EOS>
“
I
do
not
like
to
beg
the
man
’s
life
,
after
what
hath
happened—”“Tut
!
<EOS>
tut
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
king
.
<EOS>
“
Whatever
faults
may
be
imputed
to
him
,
it
shall
never
be
said
that
Charles
Stuart
was
wanting
in
magnanimity
.
<EOS>
I
forgive
the
fellow
his
attempt
upon
my
life
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
it
is
my
pleasure
that
he
be
set
free
.
<EOS>
”“Set
free
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Stelfax
,
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
“Ay
,
but
not
till
it
can
be
done
with
safety
,
”
said
the
king
.
<EOS>
“
Of
that
Colonel
Maunsel
will
judge
.
”“Colonel
<EOS>
Maunsel
will
exercise
his
own
discretion
in
the
matter
,
”
said
Stelfax
;
“
but
henceforth
your
Majesty
—
for
I
must
needs
style
<EOS>
you
so
—
will
have
no
enemy
in
me
.
<EOS>
My
lips
shall
be
sealed
to
all
I
have
seen
and
heard
this
day
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
a
man
to
make
professions
,
but
thus
much
I
will
promise
Colonel
Maunsel
in
return
for
his
generosity
,
that
he
shall
not
,
if
I
can
help
it
,
be
called
to
account
for
sheltering
his
proscribed
sovereign
.
<EOS>
To
that
I
plight
my
word
.
<EOS>
”“And
you
will
keep
your
word
,
I
am
certain
,
Captain
Stelfax
,
”
rejoined
the
king
.
<EOS>
“
Unbind
him
,
”
he
added
to
John
Habergeon
.
<EOS>
But
as
the
old
trooper
hesitated
to
obey
the
king
’s
command
,
and
was
on
the
point
of
remonstrating
with
his
Majesty
on
the
apparent
imprudence
of
the
step
,
Dulcia
,
who
had
already
risen
,
sprang
towards
the
prisoner
,
and
with
her
own
hands
undid
his
bonds
.
<EOS>
“We
are
now
quits
,
Captain
Stelfax
,
”
she
said
.
<EOS>
“I
owe
my
life
to
you
,
maiden
,
”
replied
the
other
,
in
a
voice
of
deep
emotion
.
<EOS>
“
Would
it
could
be
devoted
to
your
service!—but
<EOS>
I
know
this
can
not
be
.
<EOS>
May
you
be
happy!”Dulcia
did
not
trust
herself
to
reply
,
but
went
hastily
back
to
Clavering
,
who
had
looked
on
in
speechless
astonishment
.
<EOS>
“Take
<EOS>
Captain
Stelfax
below
,
”
said
Colonel
Maunsel
to
John
Habergeon
,
“
and
see
that
he
wants
nothing
.
<EOS>
Circumstances
,
as
you
will
readily
apprehend
,
sir
,
”
he
added
to
the
Ironside
leader
,
“
will
not
permit
me
to
requite
your
former
civility
to
myself
by
allowing
you
to
depart
as
a
prisoner
on
parole
,
but
your
comforts
shall
be
attended
to
.
<EOS>
”“I
can
not
expect
better
treatment
,
”
replied
Stelfax
.
<EOS>
“
The
best
wish
I
can
offer
to
your
Majesty
is
that
you
may
soon
see
the
other
side
of
the
Channel
.
<EOS>
”With
<EOS>
an
obeisance
to
the
king
he
then
retired
,
John
Habergeon
and
Ninian
marching
on
either
side
of
him
.
<EOS>
“There
is
some
good
about
that
rough
Republican
,
”
observed
the
king
,
when
he
was
gone
.
<EOS>
“Your
Majesty
seems
to
think
so
,
”
observed
Lord
Wilmot
.
<EOS>
“
After
your
magnanimous
treatment
of
him
,
I
do
not
wonder
he
war
converted
,
and
only
marvel
he
did
not
,
swear
fidelity
on
the
spot
.
”“Oddsfish
!
<EOS>
my
lord
,
you
overrate
my
conduct
.
<EOS>
I
had
taken
the
sting
from
the
hornet
,
why
crush
the
creature
?
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
owed
the
fellow
something
,
for
he
might
have
dispatched
me
when
I
was
alone
with
him
in
yon
hiding
-
place
.
<EOS>
But
the
matter
is
well
over
,
and
without
harm
to
any
one
except
that
miserable
Independent
minister
,
who
seems
to
have
deserved
his
fate
.
<EOS>
”“I
fear
he
did
,
sire
,
”
replied
Colonel
Maunsel
.
<EOS>
“
And
since
all
has
ended
so
fortunately
,
I
will
pray
your
Majesty
to
adjourn
to
the
banqueting
-
room
,
where
a
trifling
collation
awaits
you
.
<EOS>
As
things
have
turned
out
,
it
is
lucky
that
the
chief
part
of
the
dishes
composing
the
repast
are
cold
,
otherwise
<EOS>
the
cook
’s
labour
might
have
been
thrown
away
.
<EOS>
”“To
<EOS>
the
banqueting
-
chamber
,
then
,
at
once
,
”
exclaimed
the
king
,
gaily
.
“
<EOS>
‘
Fore
George
!
<EOS>
colonel
,
I
promise
to
do
justice
to
your
feast
,
whether
the
meats
be
hot
or
cold
.
<EOS>
My
confinement
in
yon
lurking
-
hole
has
given
me
a
wondrous
appetite
.
<EOS>
Your
hand
,
fair
mistress
.
”Blushing
with
pleasure
at
the
honour
conferred
upon
her
,
Dulcia
gave
her
hand
to
his
Majesty
,
who
led
her
down
the
grand
staircase
,
and
through
the
entrance-
hall
into
the
dining
-
room
,
where
the
tables
were
groaning
beneath
the
weight
of
a
sumptuous
repast
.
<EOS>
All
the
guests
had
very
speedily
assembled
,
and
a
place
was
assigned
to
each
by
Colonel
Maunsel
—
Charles
,
however
,
insisting
upon
Dulcia
sitting
near
him
,
though
he
good
-
naturedly
intimated
to
Clavering
that
he
might
occupy
the
chair
on
the
damsel
’s
other
side
.
<EOS>
The
repast
was
abundant
and
excellent
,
and
the
best
wines
in
the
colonel
’s
cellar
,
as
might
naturally
be
expected
,
were
produced
on
the
occasion
,
old
Martin
Geere
taking
care
that
the
glasses
were
kept
constantly
filled
.
<EOS>
The
party
were
still
seated
at
table
,
though
the
appetites
of
most
of
the
guests
were
satisfied
,
when
Colonel
Gunter
,
and
his
kinsman
,
Captain
Gunter
,
were
announced
,
and
the
two
gentlemen
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
They
had
just
arrived
from
Shoreham
,
and
brought
the
welcome
intelligence
that
Captain
Tattersall
had
got
in
his
cargo
,
and
was
quite
ready
to
sail
the
next
morning
before
daybreak
.
<EOS>
“The
rascal
,
however
,
still
sticks
to
his
terms
,
”
said
Colonel
Gunter
,
“
and
insists
upon
seeing
his
passengers
before
he
will
agree
to
take
them
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
only
a
whim
,
I
am
certain
.
<EOS>
There
will
be
no
real
difficulty
with
him
.
<EOS>
”“But
<EOS>
why
did
you
not
bring
him
here
?
”
<EOS>
cried
the
king
.
<EOS>
“For
the
best
of
all
reasons
,
my
liege
,
”
replied
Gunter
;
“
because
he
would
not
come
.
<EOS>
But
he
has
appointed
to
meet
you
this
evening
at
the
George
at
Brightelmstone
;
and
though
I
am
very
reluctant
to
disturb
your
enjoyment
,
and
withdraw
you
from
further
participation
of
Colonel
Maunsel
’s
hospitality
,
yet
I
think
it
will
be
best
and
wisest
to
repair
to
Brightelmstone
without
delay
.
<EOS>
”“You
summon
me
from
a
most
delightful
entertainment
,
”
said
the
king
.
<EOS>
“
However
,
sit
down
for
a
moment
,
man
,
and
do
you
also
take
a
chair
,
Captain
Gunter
.
<EOS>
Let
all
glasses
be
charged
—
my
own
,
you
see
,
is
full
to
the
brim
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
depart
without
drinking
the
health
of
our
host
,
and
I
hope
it
may
not
be
long
ere
<EOS>
I
shall
visit
him
again
—
though
in
other
sort
than
the
present
—
at
Ovingdean
Grange
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
old
Cavalier
was
quite
overwhelmed
by
the
gracious
words
of
his
royal
master
,
and
vainly
endeavoured
to
express
his
deep
sense
of
gratitude
.
<EOS>
Charles
,
however
,
took
him
kindly
by
the
hand
,
and
said,“Not
another
word
,
colonel
—
not
another
word
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
you
would
say
.
<EOS>
Do
not
forget
your
promise
to
me
to
make
these
two
young
people
happy
.
<EOS>
Take
my
word
for
it
,
your
son
could
not
have
made
a
better
choice
.
<EOS>
I
must
now
bid
you
adieu
!
<EOS>
Brief
<EOS>
as
my
visit
has
been
,
it
has
comprehended
incident
enough
to
serve
me
for
a
much
longer
interval
,
and
I
might
have
remained
a
week
in
some
other
places
and
not
have
had
half
so
much
excitement
.
<EOS>
My
adventures
at
Ovingdean
Grange
are
a
worthy
finish
to
my
six
weeks
’
wanderings
.
<EOS>
”The
<EOS>
king
then
rose
,
and
all
the
company
rose
likewise
.
<EOS>
Finding
it
was
his
Majesty
’s
wish
to
depart
immediately
,
notwithstanding
his
disappointment
at
losing
his
royal
guest
,
and
his
desire
to
detain
him
,
Colonel
Maunsel
did
not
offer
any
opposition
,
but
ordered
the
horses
to
be
brought
round
without
delay
.
<EOS>
While
his
injunctions
were
being
fulfilled
,
the
king
repaired
to
the
colonel
’s
chamber
,
and
resumed
the
travelling
habiliments
which
he
had
temporarily
laid
aside
.
<EOS>
Equipped
as
he
had
been
on
his
arrival
,
he
then
descended
to
the
entrance
-
hall
,
where
all
were
assembled
to
witness
his
departure
,
the
household
crowding
round
him
,
and
reiterating
their
expressions
of
loyalty
and
devotion
as
he
came
down
the
staircase
.
<EOS>
Foremost
amongst
them
was
Patty
Whinchat
,
who
was
fortunate
enough
to
obtain
a
valedictory
word
and
smile
from
his
Majesty
.
<EOS>
Temperance
Stone
was
also
amongst
the
throng
,
and
from
that
moment
abjured
her
Republican
notions
,
and
became
a
staunch
Royalist
.
<EOS>
Bowing
repeatedly
to
the
assemblage
,
and
addressing
a
few
parting
civilities
to
Dulcia
and
Mr.
Beard
,
Charles
went
forth
with
his
host
,
who
would
insist
upon
holding
the
stirrup
for
him
as
he
mounted
,
and
who
invoked
Heaven
<EOS>
’s
blessings
on
his
Majesty
’s
head
,
as
the
king
bade
him
a
kindly
farewell
.
<EOS>
Accompanied
by
an
escort
,
consisting
of
Clavering
Maunsel
and
Lord
Wilmot
,
Colonel
Philips
and
the
two
Gunters
,
and
followed
by
John
Habergeon
and
Ninian
Saxby
,
the
king
rode
slowly
up
the
valley
,
and
then
mounted
the
eminence
on
the
left
.
<EOS>
On
gaining
the
brow
of
the
hill
,
he
paused
for
a
moment
to
take
a
last
look
of
the
old
house
amidst
its
trees
,
and
then
rode
round
the
sweeping
heights
of
White
Hawk
Hill
in
the
direction
of
Brightelmstone
.

BRIGHTELMSTONE
IN
1651CHAPTER
IA
Glance
At
Brightelmstone
<EOS>
In
The
Nineteenth
<EOS>
CenturyLITTLE
did
Charles
the
Second
foresee
,
when
halting
on
the
evening
in
question
with
his
escort
on
the
smooth
and
pleasant
slopes
of
the
hill
now
laid
out
as
the
Queen
’s
Park
,
that
on
the
site
of
the
obscure
fishing
-
village
towards
which
he
gazed
,
would
arise
,
some
two
centuries
later
,
one
of
the
fairest
and
most
magnificent
cities
ever
built
on
the
margin
of
the
sea
,
since
the
time
when
Pompeii
the
Beautiful
was
destroyed
by
the
fiery
ashes
of
Vesuvius
.
<EOS>
Little
did
he
think
that
the
bare
and
solitary
cliffs
above
which
he
stood
would
be
covered
with
lines
of
stately
terraces
,
comprising
mansions
many
of
which
would
rival
in
size
and
splendour
the
most
princely
habitations
of
the
London
of
his
own
day
.
<EOS>
Little
did
he
think
that
in
that
wide
hollow
,
now
known
as
the
Steyne
,
through
the
midst
of
which
an
open
brook
found
its
way
to
the
sea
,
where
stunted
trees
distorted
by
the
gales
,
and
mean
scattered
habitations
surrounded
by
patches
of
ill
-
kept
gardens
,
and
tenanted
by
fishermen
and
other
seafaring
folk
,
could
alone
be
distinguished
—
little
did
he
think
that
in
this
dreary
hollow
one
of
the
most
refined
of
his
successors
,
and
one
whose
Sybaritic
tastes
were
in
many
respects
akin
to
his
own
,
would
construct
a
palace
of
Oriental
splendour
.
<EOS>
Little
did
he
foresee
that
,
in
the
lapse
of
time
,
this
remote
and
almost
unknown
fishing
village
on
the
Sussex
coast
should
become
,
by
agencies
of
which
he
could
not
dream
,
and
which
,
if
described
,
he
might
not
have
credited
,
so
connected
with
the
great
metropolis
itself
,
as
to
form
almost
its
marine
suburb
.
<EOS>
Little
did
he
foresee
these
wondrous
and
inconceivable
changes
.
<EOS>
And
if
a
vision
of
the
Brighton
of
the
Nineteenth
Century
could
have
been
revealed
to
him
,
he
might
have
thought
he
had
been
suddenly
transported
to
some
other
and
more
favoured
portion
of
the
globe
.
<EOS>
What
two
centuries
more
may
do
for
this
superb
marine
city
<EOS>
we
are
not
bold
enough
to
speculate
.
<EOS>
But
if
the
changes
should
be
as
great
as
those
which
have
occurred
since
Charles
the
Second
gazed
upon
the
little
parent
village
on
the
evening
of
the
14th
of
October
,
1651
,
Brighton
will
have
become
a
marvellous
city
indeed
.
<EOS>
But
since
there
was
no
magician
in
the
young
king
’s
escort
to
raise
up
for
him
a
vision
of
the
future
splendid
city
,
nor
any
astrologer
to
foretell
its
grandeur
,
Charles
saw
only
that
which
was
exhibited
to
the
ordinary
eye
of
humanity
.
<EOS>
And
the
picture
,
it
must
be
owned
,
was
one
that
did
not
excite
any
extraordinary
interest
in
his
breast
;
neither
might
it
merit
any
special
description
,
except
that
there
may
be
some
persons
not
indisposed
to
learn
what
the
Queen
of
English
watering
-
places
was
like
two
centuries
ago
.
<EOS>
Immediately
below
the
gentle
declivity
where
Charles
was
stationed
,
and
almost
on
the
spot
now
occupied
by
Royal
Crescent
,
stood
three
windmills
,
not
very
far
apart
from
each
other
.
<EOS>
These
windmills
,
with
a
solitary
farm
-
house
and
barn
,
together
with
a
few
scattered
cottages
,
were
the
only
buildings
discernible
on
the
eastern
cliff
.
<EOS>
The
village
of
Brightelmstone
actually
stood
on
the
western
side
of
the
Steyne
,
where
the
older
part
of
the
town
is
still
to
be
found
.
<EOS>
Here
,
on
a
gentle
declivity
of
the
hill
,
on
the
summit
of
which
stood
the
ancient
church
of
Saint
Nicholas
,
then
far
removed
from
every
other
habitation
,
and
serving
as
a
landmark
to
the
mariner
,
was
collected
together
a
considerable
number
of
houses
,
few
of
them
of
any
size
or
pretension
,
and
for
the
most
part
constructed
of
glazed
bricks
mingled
with
flints
,
in
order
to
resist
the
weather
,
and
having
shingle
roofs
.
<EOS>
Like
most
old
Sussex
towns
—
as
,
for
example
,
Chichester
and
Lewes
—
Brightelmstone
was
so
closely
and
compactly
built
that
it
might
be
described
as
a
great
block
of
houses
,
intersected
by
alleys
or
lanes
so
extremely
narrow
as
scarcely
to
allow
two
persons
meeting
in
them
to
pass
each
other
,
and
known
in
the
dialect
of
the
place
as
“
twittens
.
”
<EOS>
But
perhaps
the
most
curious
feature
of
the
old
town
,
all
traces
of
which
have
long
since
been
swept
away
by
the
encroachments
of
the
sea
,
was
then
to
be
found
below
the
cliff
.
<EOS>
Here
was
built
a
long
street
of
little
tenements
,
stretching
from
the
Steyne
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
along
the
shore
in
the
direction
of
Hove
.
<EOS>
These
tenements
were
exclusively
inhabited
by
fishermen
and
boatmen
,
a
bold
and
hardy
,
though
somewhat
troublesome
,
race
,
who
claimed
to
themselves
certain
privileges
and
immunities
,
and
were
uncommonly
tenacious
,
and
,
indeed
,
pugnacious
,
in
the
maintenance
of
their
supposed
rights
.
<EOS>
The
Brightelmstone
fishermen
formed
a
distinct
class
from
the
rest
of
the
townsfolk
,
and
were
constantly
at
loggerheads
with
the
latter
.
<EOS>
On
the
edge
of
the
cliff
,
and
towering
above
these
humble
dwellings
,
which
it
threatened
to
crush
by
its
fall
(
and
such
an
accident
did
eventually
occur
)
,
stood
,
at
the
date
of
our
story
,
an
ancient
castle
,
or
block
-
house
of
stone
,
constructed
by
Henry
VIII
about
the
year
1539
,
for
the
defence
of
the
coast
.
<EOS>
The
town
of
Brightelmstone
,
as
we
have
stated
,
was
chiefly
concentrated
on
the
side
of
the
hill
,
and
did
not
extend
beyond
West
Street
,
whither
we
shall
presently
repair
.
<EOS>
From
this
point
to
the
neighbouring
village
of
Hove
there
only
intervened
a
few
cottages
and
a
single
farm
-
house
,
and
these
at
wide
intervals
.
<EOS>
Noting
much
that
we
have
described
—
namely
,
the
old
church
,
the
cluster
of
houses
on
the
hill
-
side
,
and
the
block
-
house
—
Charles
suffered
his
gaze
to
stray
towards
Shoreham
,
where
he
could
just
descry
the
masts
of
the
vessels
within
the
harbour
,
and
wondered
whether
any
that
he
saw
belonged
to
the
Swiftsure
.
<EOS>
Satisfied
with
his
survey
,
Charles
put
his
horse
in
motion
,
and
the
whole
party
rode
on
,
taking
their
way
down
the
declivity
,
which
is
now
occupied
by
a
dense
mass
of
habitations
,
but
which
was
then
merely
the
green
slope
of
a
down
—
its
smoothness
being
here
and
<EOS>
there
broken
by
a
patch
of
gorse
or
a
venerable
hawthorn
.
<EOS>
Sheep
were
fed
,
and
the
shepherd
trod
on
the
thymy
turf
then
covering
the
descent
where
now
runs
the
crowded
thoroughfare
of
Saint
James’-street
.
<EOS>
At
the
foot
of
the
hill
grew
a
small
straggling
holt
,
and
the
stunted
trees
composing
it
looked
like
well
-
worn
brooms
,
<EOS>
so
distorted
were
they
by
the
strong
south
-
westerly
gales
blowing
along
the
valley
.
<EOS>
On
the
verge
of
this
thicket
a
halt
was
made
,
and
it
was
then
arranged
that
the
king
should
proceed
,
under
the
guidance
of
Colonel
Gunter
only
,
to
the
George
Inn
,
in
West
street
.
<EOS>
Lord
Wilmot
was
to
join
them
there
after
a
while
;
but
it
was
not
deemed
prudent
that
the
others
should
appear
at
the
inn
—
at
all
events
,
not
until
a
much
later
hour
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
they
undertook
to
act
as
scouts
about
the
town
,
under
the
direction
of
Clavering
Maunsell
.
<EOS>
These
arrangements
made
,
the
king
and
Colonel
Gunter
dismounted
,
and
leaving
their
steeds
with
the
others
,
crossed
a
bridge
over
the
little
brook
running
through
the
valley
,
and
immediately
afterwards
entered
the
town
.
<EOS>
Their
object
being
to
elude
observation
,
they
walked
quickly
,
Colonel
Gunter
,
as
acquainted
with
the
place
,
keeping
slightly
ahead
of
the
monarch
.
<EOS>
After
proceeding
to
a
short
distance
up
North
street
,
they
plunged
into
a
narrow
alley
on
the
left
,
and
having
tracked
a
series
of
“
twittens
,
”
without
encountering
any
material
check
in
their
progress
,
except
such
as
was
offered
by
a
fat
fishwoman
,
who
compelled
them
both
to
seek
temporary
refuge
in
an
open
doorway
while
she
passed
by
,
they
issued
forth
in
West
street
—
if
street
a
few
scattered
houses
ought
to
be
called
—
at
the
lower
end
of
which
,
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
sea
,
stood
the
hostel
of
which
they
were
in
search
.

IllustrationCHAPTER
IIThe
<EOS>
“
George
”
At
BrightelmstoneTHE
George
Inn
,
which
still
exists
,
though
,
since
the
event
we
are
about
to
relate
it
has
very
properly
altered
its
designation
,
and
is
now
known
as
the
King
’s
Head
,
was
a
comfortable
house
,
noted
for
good
liquor
and
for
the
civility
of
the
host
,
whose
name
was
of
good
augury
to
the
guest
,
being
no
other
than
Bonfellow
Smith
.
<EOS>
The
hostel
,
which
stood
on
the
west
side
of
the
straggling
street
,
was
detached
from
the
adjacent
habitations
,
and
was
further
separated
from
the
dwelling
on
its
northerly
side
by
a
large
yard
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
commodious
,
well
built
structure
,
with
bay
-
windows
,
projecting
porch
with
carved
posts
and
lintel
,
gable
roof
covered
with
shingle
,
and
large
chimneys
of
the
true
Sussex
build
,
and
wore
altogether
a
not
uninviting
aspect
.
<EOS>
Such
,
at
least
,
was
the
impression
produced
upon
Charles
as
he
followed
his
conductor
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
Master
Bonfellow
Smith
,
host
of
the
George
,
had
nothing
of
the
Puritan
in
his
appearance
or
deportment
.
<EOS>
He
was
all
smiles
and
civility
—
indeed
,
his
manner
might
almost
be
termed
obsequious
—
while
it
was
abundantly
manifest
from
his
rotund
person
,
rosy
gills
,
and
double
chin
,
that
he
was
by
no
means
accustomed
to
mortify
the
flesh
.
<EOS>
Originally
,
he
had
filled
the
office
of
groom
of
the
chamber
in
the
royal
establishment
at
Whitehall
,
and
was
then
a
great
man
—
a
very
great
man
.
<EOS>
But
times
had
changed
.
<EOS>
Rebellion
and
revolution
were
in
the
ascendant
;
the
royal
household
was
broken
up
and
dispersed
;
and
our
groom
of
the
chamber
retired
in
disgust
to
his
native
village
of
Brightelmstone
,
and
eventually
became
landlord
of
the
comfortable
hostel
where
we
find
him
.
<EOS>
Master
Bonfellow
Smith
was
lucky
enough
to
possess
a
wife
who
proved
of
infinite
use
to
him
in
his
business
.
<EOS>
Like
her
husband
,
she
had
filled
a
subordinate
situation
in
the
royal
household
at
Whitehall
,
having
been
tire
-
maiden
to
one
of
the
queen
’s
gentlewomen
,
and
,
like
him
,
she
could
not
forget
her
former
importance
;
but
being
a
person
of
great
prudence
,
she
accommodated
herself
to
existing
circumstances
,
and
did
not
allow
her
recollections
of
bygone
grandeur
to
interfere
with
the
discharge
of
her
duties
as
a
landlady
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Smith
was
some
years
younger
than
her
spouse
;
and
had
been
accounted
very
pretty
by
pages
and
other
gallants
at
Whitehall
.
<EOS>
She
was
still
a
comely
woman
,
though
on
rather
a
large
scale
.
<EOS>
It
was
by
this
worthy
couple
that
Charles
was
welcomed
on
entering
the
inn
.
<EOS>
Bowing
obsequiously
to
his
guests
,
on
hearing
that
they
meant
to
take
supper
,
and
expected
two
or
three
friends
to
join
them
at
it
,
the
host
directed
his
wife
to
bring
lights
—
it
was
now
growing
rapidly
dusk
—
and
ushered
the
gentlemen
into
a
roomy
chamber
on
the
right
,
which
looked
very
snug
and
comfortable
,
<EOS>
inasmuch
as
a
cheerful
fire
was
burning
on
the
hearth
.
<EOS>
The
apartment
was
wainscoted
with
black
oak
,
and
well
provided
with
elbow
chairs
of
the
same
material
.
<EOS>
A
solid
oak
table
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
floor
,
and
a
bow
-
window
at
the
side
looked
into
the
inn
yard
.
<EOS>
Buxom
Mrs.
Smith
followed
close
upon
the
king
’s
heels
with
the
lights
,
and
was
about
to
set
them
down
upon
the
table
,
when
Charles
turned
and
looked
her
full
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
Her
features
seemed
familiar
to
him
,
though
he
could
not
call
to
mind
under
what
circumstances
he
had
previously
beheld
them
.
<EOS>
But
if
the
king
’s
memory
was
at
fault
,
Mrs.
Smith
’s
was
not
.
<EOS>
She
instantly
recognized
the
young
monarch
in
his
disguise
,
uttered
a
faint
scream
,
and
began
to
gasp
and
shake
so
violently
that
the
candles
threatened
to
fall
from
her
hold
.
<EOS>
“‘Oons
!
<EOS>
Joan
—
what
the
plague
ails
the
woman
?
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Bonfellow
Smith
,
staring
at
her
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
“
What
’s
the
matter
,
I
say?”“I
do
—
o
—
on’t
know
—
I
ca
—
a
—
n’t
speak
,
”
she
stammered
,
as
Charles
signed
to
her
to
keep
silence
.
<EOS>
“Don’t
know
—
and
ca
n’t
speak
!
”
<EOS>
echoed
Smith
.
<EOS>
“
<EOS>
‘
Sbud
!
<EOS>
this
is
something
new
.
<EOS>
You
can
use
your
tongue
pretty
freely
in
an
ordinary
way
.
<EOS>
Set
down
the
candles
and
leave
the
room
.
”“Allow
<EOS>
me
to
help
you
,
my
good
mistress
,
”
said
the
king
,
taking
the
candles
from
her
,
and
placing
them
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
“I
beg
your
honour
’s
pardon
,
”
exclaimed
Smith
,
in
an
apologetic
tone
.
<EOS>
“
I
ca
n’t
think
what
has
come
to
my
wife
.
<EOS>
I
never
saw
her
in
such
a
way
before
.
<EOS>
Do
n’t
stand
staring
there
,
Joan
,
I
tell
‘
ee
.
”“Never
<EOS>
mind
your
wife
,
my
good
man
,
”
said
Charles
.
<EOS>
“
She
’ll
be
all
right
presently
.
<EOS>
Draw
the
window
-
curtain
,
for
we
do
n’t
care
to
be
overlooked
—
and
then
we
’ll
talk
about
supper
.
<EOS>
Compose
yourself
,
if
possible
,
my
good
Joan
,
”
he
added
,
in
a
whisper
,
“
or
you
will
rouse
your
husband
’s
suspicions
.
”“Oh
!
<EOS>
your
Majesty
need
n’t
fear
him
,
”
she
rejoined
,
in
the
same
tone
.
<EOS>
“
You
have
n’t
a
more
loyal
subject
than
Smith
.
<EOS>
He
would
lay
down
his
life
for
you

<EOS>
Here
,
hubby

<EOS>
hubby

<EOS>
she
cried
aloud
,
“
come
this
way

<EOS>
Look
at
this
gentleman

you
’ll
no
longer
wonder
at
my
excitement

<EOS>
Do
n’t
you
know
him

<EOS>
she
added
,
seizing
his
hand
.
<EOS>
“Know
him
!
<EOS>
Gadzooks
!
<EOS>
I
should
think
I
did

”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Smith
,
now
almost
as
much
excited
as
his
wife
.
<EOS>
“
I
should
know
that
face
amid
a
thousand
.
<EOS>
Oh
dear

<EOS>
oh

<EOS>

the
like

<EOS>
cried
Mrs.
Smith

<EOS>
“

your
homage

fidelity

cried
Bonfellow
Smith
,
as
he
and
his
wife
prostrated
themselves
before
Charles
.
<EOS>
“
Command

<EOS>
”“Nay

replied
Charles
,
laughing

<EOS>
“
I
accept

Accident

Providence

has
again
thrown
me
amongst

I

watch

<EOS>
To

unhesitatingly
inform

The
captain

be

I
expect

You

take

”“All

said
Smith

“And

he
continued

drawing
her
towards
him

“It

have
kissed

said
Charles

laughing

<EOS>
“Not

replied
the
hostess
,
dropping
a
grateful
curtsey
.
<EOS>
“
I
have
often
told
Smith
how
the
merry
young
prince
used
to
chase
me
along

Ah

those
were
happy

And
he
sang
and
capered
about
the
room
in
so
droll
a
manner

that
both
Charles

Colonel
Gunter
were
ready
to
die
with
laughing

“It

“

”
said
Charles
to
Lord
Wilmot
.
<EOS>
“
These
good
folks
are
old
acquaintances
,
and
belonged
to
the
king
my
father
’s
household
at
Whitehall
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
congratulate
you
on
your
good
fortune
,
my
liege
,
”
replied
his
lordship
.
<EOS>
“
Nay
,
I
think
I
remember
them
.
<EOS>
That
should
be
Bonfellow
Smith
,
and
,
unless
I
am
greatly
mistaken
,
this
must
be
pretty
Joan
Awbray
,
my
lady
’s
own
tirewoman
.
<EOS>
”“Your
<EOS>
lordship
is
right
in
both
instances
,
”
said
the
host
.
<EOS>
“
But
the
somewhile
Joan
Awbray
is
now
Mrs.
Bonfellow
Smith
,
at
your
lordship
’s
service
.
”After
<EOS>
his
lordship
had
passed
a
few
compliments
upon
Mrs.
Smith
’s
improved
appearance
,
and
expressed
his
satisfaction
at
seeing
her
husband
again
,
Charles
gave
the
worthy
couple
a
good
-
natured
hint
to
withdraw
,
and
they
both
left
the
room
,
renewing
their
protestations
of
devotion
,
and
promising
that
all
needful
precautions
should
be
taken
for
his
Majesty
’s
security
.
<EOS>
They
had
not
been
gone
more
than
five
minutes
when
heavy
footsteps
were
heard
outside
,
and
a
hoarse
voice
was
heard
inquiring
if
Master
William
Jackson
was
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
“There
<EOS>
he
is
!
<EOS>
that
’s
Captain
Tattersall
,
”
cried
Colonel
Gunter
,
flying
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
“
This
way
,
captain
,
”
he
added
.
<EOS>
“
Here
we
are
!
<EOS>
here
’s
Mr.
Jackson
.
<EOS>
”On
<EOS>
this
summons
Tattersall
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
His
apparel
was
pretty
nearly
the
same
as
that
in
which
he
appeared
on
a
former
occasion
,
except
that
he
now
wore
a
pair
of
heavy
boots
.
<EOS>
He
brought
with
him
a
great
bundle
of
seamen
’s
attire
,
of
which
the
host
,
who
had
followed
him
into
the
room
,
hastened
to
relieve
him
.
<EOS>
“Ay
,
ay
,
put
those
traps
down
,
mine
host
,
”
cried
the
skipper
;
“
or
,
harkye
<EOS>
,
you
had
best
convey
them
to
some
chamber
above
stairs
.
<EOS>
Mayhap
they
’ll
be
wanted
by-
<EOS>
and
-
by
.
<EOS>
Good
e’en
to
you
,
gentlemen
—
<EOS>
good
e’en
to
you
,
”
he
added
,
bowing
to
the
company
.
<EOS>
While
doing
so
,
he
fixed
a
scrutinizing
look
upon
the
two
strangers
,
and
appeared
particularly
struck
by
the
king
’s
appearance
.
<EOS>
“Glad
to
see
you
,
Captain
Tattersall
,
”
cried
Colonel
Gunter
,
clapping
him
on
the
shoulder
.
<EOS>
“
You
are
as
punctual
as
the
clock
.
<EOS>
This
is
my
friend
,
Mr.
Barlow
,
captain
,
”
indicating
Lord
Wilmot
,
“
and
this
is
Mr.
William
Jackson
,
”
he
added
,
pointing
to
the
king
.
<EOS>
“Barlow
and
Jackson
,
eh
!
”
exclaimed
the
skipper
,
placing
his
finger
on
the
side
of
his
nose
.
<EOS>
“
Two
very
good
travelling
names
though
Smith
might
be
better
.
<EOS>
”“My
<EOS>
name
is
Smith
,
I
beg
to
observe
,
Captain
Tattersall
,
”
remarked
the
host—“Bonfellow
Smith
.
<EOS>
Which
nobody
can
deny!”“True
,
I
had
forgotten
that
,
”
replied
Tattersall
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
“Bring
pipes
,
Spanish
tobacco
,
ale
and
brandy
—
Nantz
,
d’ye

”
cried
Colonel
Gunter
.
<EOS>
“Your
honour
shall
be
served
in
a
trice
,
”
replied
Smith
,
disappearing
.
<EOS>
“Pray
be
seated
,
Captain
Tattersall
—
pray
be
seated
,
”
said
Charles
.
<EOS>
“
There
will
be
no
difficulty
about
our
passage
,
I
suppose
,
captain
?
<EOS>
You
are
very
particular
,
I
hear
.
<EOS>
But
I
hope
our
looks
satisfy
you
.
<EOS>
”“Your
<EOS>
looks
are
very
much
in
your
favour
with
me
,
Mr.
Jackson
,
”
the
skipper
replied
,
significantly
,
“
though
they
might
n’t
please
every
other
shipmaster
equally
well
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
I
have
seen
you
before
,
sir
.
”“Indeed
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
king
.
<EOS>
“
Where
,
and
when
,
captain
?
<EOS>
I
do
n’t
recollect
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
”“Possibly
<EOS>
not
,
sir
,
”
returned
the
skipper
.
<EOS>
“
But
I
have
good
reason
to
remember
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
the
year
<EOS>
1648—three
years
ago
,
Heaven
save
the
mark
—
that
the
royal
fleet
,
under
the
command
of
his
Royal
Highness
Prince
Charles
,
suddenly
appeared
off
this
coast
,
and
captured
several
sloops
,
fishing
-
vessels
,
and
other
craft
—
my
brig
,
the
Swiftsure
,
being
amongst
the
number
.
<EOS>
”“And
you
were
made
prisoner
?
”
cried
the
king
.
<EOS>
“I
was
made
prisoner
,
”
replied
the
skipper
,
“
and
with
several
of
my
fellow
shipmasters
was
brought
before
the
young
prince
.
<EOS>
And
what
do
you
think
his
Royal
Highness
did?”“Nay
,
I
ca
n’t
tell
,
”
replied
the
king
.
<EOS>
“
Treated
you
like
rebels
,
it
may
be?—ordered
you
all
to
be
handcuffed
and
placed
below
the
hatches?”“Nothing
of
the
sort
,
”
rejoined
Tattersall
.
<EOS>
“
The
only
punishment
he
inflicted
upon
us
was
to
make
each
of
us
toss
off
a
glass
of
brandy
to
his
royal
father
’s
health
,
and
then
—
bless
his
noble
heart!—he
set
us
all
free
.
”“Oddsfish
!
<EOS>
that
’s
rather
like
him
,
I
must
say
,
”
observed
Charles
.
<EOS>
“
He
has
been
doing
foolish
things
all
his
life
—
eh
,
Barlow?”“Perfectly
true
,
Mr.
Jackson
,
”
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
“But
<EOS>
I
do
n’t
look
upon
this
as
a
foolish
thing
,
”
said
Tattersall
.
<EOS>
“
Leastways
,
his
clemency
was
n’t
thrown
away
upon
me
,
for
I
vowed
then
,
that
if
ever
opportunity
offered
,
I
’d
show
my
gratitude
,
and
I
’ll
be
as
good
as
my
word
.
”“Delighted
<EOS>
to
hear
you
say
so
,
Captain
Tattersall
,
”
observed
the
king
.
<EOS>
“
The
feeling
is
very
creditable
to
you
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n’t
see
how
I
am
connected
with
the
circumstance
you
have
related
.
<EOS>
”“We
<EOS>
are
friends
of
Cæsar
<EOS>
,
I
believe
?
”
said
Tattersall
.
<EOS>
“All
friends
of
Cæsar
,
captain
,
”
replied
the
host
,
bringing
in
a
bottle
of
brandy
and
glasses
,
while
his
wife
followed
with
pipes
and
tobacco
.
<EOS>
“
Mrs.
Bonfellow
Smith
is
Cæsar
’s
particular
friend
.
<EOS>
Which
nobody
can
<EOS>
deny!”“He
always
was
fond
of
the
lasses
,
”
said
Tattersall
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
“
Give
me
a
glass
of
brandy
,
sirrah
host
.
<EOS>
As
I
told
you
just
now
,
I
drank
to
the
late
king
’s
health
by
command
of
the
noble
prince
,
his
son
.
<EOS>
”“But
<EOS>
that
was
upon
compulsion
,
”
observed
Charles
,
“
and
must
have
gone
against
the
grain
.
<EOS>
”“It
went
no
more
against
the
grain
than
the
pledge
I
am
about
to
drink
now
,
”
rejoined
the
skipper
.
<EOS>
“
Here
’s
to
the
noble
young
prince
who
gave
me
freedom
,
and
by
the
act
bound
me
to
him
by
ties
of
everlasting
gratitude
!
<EOS>
Here
’s
to
him
who
ought
to
wear
the
crown
of
England
,
only
rogues
have
dispossessed
him
of
it
.
<EOS>
Here
’s
to
my
royal
master
—
for
I
acknowledge
no
other
,
except
the
Master
<EOS>
above!—and
may
he
soon
be
out
of
the
reach
of
his
enemies
,
and
it
sha
n’t
be
Nick
Tattersall
’s
<EOS>
fault
if
he
be
not
so
.
”
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
drained
the
glass
to
the
last
drop
.
<EOS>
“Oddsfish
!
<EOS>
Tattersall
,
”
cried
the
king
,
“
you
were
represented
to
me
as
a
half-
Republican
,
but
I
find
you
a
thorough
-
going
Royalist
.
”“Whatever
<EOS>
flag
I
may
be
obliged
to
hoist
,
my
true
colours
are
the
king
’s
colours
,
and
those
I
wear
next
my
heart
,
”
replied
Tattersall
.
<EOS>
“
And
now
to
cut
matters
short
,
since
all
’s
settled
,
I
’ll
make
bold
to
tell
your
Majesty
what
I
think
had
best
be
done
.
<EOS>
You
may
have
noticed
that
I
brought
a
bundle
of
seamen
’s
clothes
with
me
.
<EOS>
Let
me
recommend
your
Majesty
,
and
your
fellow-
passenger
that
is
to
be
,
to
rig
yourselves
out
in
the
gear
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
a
suit
apiece
,
so
that
in
case
of
any
unexpected
hindrance
—
as
you
have
no
passes
,
and
might
be
stopped
—
you
can
go
on
board
as
part
of
my
crew
.
<EOS>
The
brig
will
slip
her
moorings
,
and
get
out
of
the
harbour
two
hours
after
midnight
,
and
will
lie
off
shore
in
waiting
for
us
.
<EOS>
I
’ve
got
a
boat
to
take
us
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
do
n’t
anticipate
any
difficulty
,
but
it
’s
best
to
be
on
the
safe
side
.
<EOS>
”“I
quite
agree
with
you
,
Tattersall
,
”
replied
Charles
.
<EOS>
“
You
have
shown
great
forethought
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
introduced
Lord
Wilmot
to
you
.
<EOS>
(
Tattersall
bowed
.
)
<EOS>
His
lordship
and
I
will
at
once
proceed
to
change
our
attire
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Gunter
will
attend
to
your
wants
in
the
interim
,
and
ere
you
have
smoked
your
first
pipe
we
will
be
back
with
you
,
fully
equipped
in
the
habiliments
you
have
so
thoughtfully
provided
for
us
.
<EOS>
”So
<EOS>
saying
,
his
Majesty
and
Lord
Wilmot
quitted
the
room
,
preceded
by
the
hostess
,
bearing
a
light

CHAPTER
IIIIntroducing
Two
Of
Captain
Tattersall
’s
Crew“AND
now
,
Captain
Tattersall
,
”
said
Gunter
,
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
,
“
we
’ll
settle
our
accounts
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
Here
’s
the
other
half
of
the
passage-
money
—
fifty
caroluses
.
<EOS>
”“Well
,
a
bargain
’s
a
bargain
,
colonel
,
”
replied
the
skipper
,
bestowing
the
bag
of
gold
in
his
jacket
;
“
but
if
you
had
only
spoken
plainly
at
first
,
and
told
me
who
wanted
a
passage
with
me
,
I
would
have
placed
my
vessel
at
his
Majesty
’s
disposal
.
<EOS>
”“You
ca
n’t
blame
me
for
acting
cautiously
in
a
case
of
such
importance
,
captain
,
”
Gunter
replied
.
<EOS>
“
And
pardon
me
for
saying
that
I
did
n’t
know
you
so
well
as
I
do
now
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
you
richly
deserve
all
you
’ve
got
,
and
more
,
and
I
trust
this
matter
will
be
the
making
of
you
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
hope
to
Heaven
<EOS>
it
may
,
colonel
!
”
<EOS>
replied
Tattersall
.
<EOS>
“
Howsomever
,
as
I
said
before
,
if
I
save
his
Majesty
it
’ll
be
reward
enough
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
’ll
have
it
written
on
my
tombstone
,
‘
Here
lies
Nick
Tattersall
,
who
faithfully
preserved
his
king
.
’
<EOS>
Moreover
,
if
I
accomplish
this
voyage
securely
,
I
’ll
change
the
name
of
my
ship
,
and
call
her
the
Royal
Escape
.
”“An
<EOS>
excellent
name
<EOS>
,
”
said
Gunter
,
filling
a
pipe
with
tobacco
and
lighting
it
,
while
the
skipper
followed
his
example
;
“
<EOS>
and
I
hope
your
brig
will
earn
a
title
to
it
.
<EOS>
The
wind
is
favourable
,
eh?”“Ay
,
the
wind
is
nor’-east
,
and
if
it
holds
where
it
is
—
and
I
feel
pretty
sure
it
will
—
we
shall
have
a
quick
run
across
to
Fécamp
,
near
Havre
-
de
-
Grace
,
in
Normandy
,
for
that
’s
the
port
I
mean
to
make
for
.
”“Fécamp
<EOS>
,
eh
?
<EOS>
I
fancied
you
would
have
tried
for
Dieppe
.
<EOS>
But
the
port
matters
not
,
provided
you
land
his
Majesty
safely
in
France
—
<EOS>
that
’s
the
main
point
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
wo
n’t
fall
in
with
any
cruisers
.
<EOS>
”“I
hope
we
sha
n’t
,
”
rejoined
the
skipper
,
puffing
away
at
his
pipe
,
“
but
I
ai
n’t
much
afeared
of

<EOS>
The
Swiftsure‘ll
show
‘

a
light
pair
of
heels
;
and
if
they
do
overhaul
us
,
they
’ll
take
the
king
and
his
lordship
for
part
o

the
crew

<EOS>
What
I
should
least
like
to
meet
would
be
one
of
them
<EOS>
rattlin

Ostend
privateers

which
,
ever
since
the
war
broke
out

France

Spain

have
been
hoverin

about
the
French
coast

on
the
look

out
for
prizes

<EOS>
I
should
n’t
like
to
meet
one
o
’
<EOS>
them
ugly
customers
,
for
they
might
plunder
us
,
and
set
us
ashore
in
England

<EOS>
”“‘Sdeath
!
<EOS>
that
would
be
a
mishap
indeed
!

<EOS>
exclaimed
Gunter
.
<EOS>
“
But
let
us
hope
for
the
best

<EOS>
Heaven

preserved
the

’s
that

<EOS>
he
added
,
as
exclamations
and
laughter
,
proceeding
from
the
hostess
,
were
heard
outside
.
<EOS>
“I
should
n’t
wonder

two
of
my

replied
Tattersall
,
with
a
wink
.
<EOS>
“
I
’ve
been
expectin

<EOS>
Ay

”
<EOS>
he
cried
,
as
the
door
was
thrown
open
by
the
hostess
,
who
was
laughing
immoderately
,
and
two
rollicking
individuals
,
with
the
gait
,
gestures
,
looks
,
and
attire
of
seamen
of
the
period
—
that
is
to
say
,
blue
jackets
and
brown
slops
,
Guernsey
shirts
and
red
caps
,
like
the
skipper
himself
—
rolled
,
rather
than
walked
,
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
“Why
,
they
’re
enough
to
deceive
a
body
to
one
s
very
face
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Mrs.
Smith
,
holding
up
her
hands
in
admiration
.
<EOS>
“
If

better

under

<EOS>
How
long
have
my
messmate
Tom
Barlow
<EOS>
and
I
sailed
wi
’
ye
<EOS>
i
’
the
Swiftsure?”“Ever
since
1648
,
Will
Jackson
,
”
replied
Tattersall
,
emitting
a
long
puff
of
tobacco
.
<EOS>
“
But
sit
down
,
my
lads
—
sit
down
.
<EOS>
Take
a
glass
of
grog
,
and
smoke
a
pipe
.
<EOS>
Do
n’t
mind
me
—
I’m
not
partic’lar
<EOS>
when
ashore
.
<EOS>
This
gentleman
,
I
dare
say
,
wo
n’t
mind
ye

<EOS>
”“Not
in
the
least
,
”
replied
Gunter
.
<EOS>
“
Sit
down
,
my
lads
,
I
beg
of
you
.
<EOS>
These
are
two
stout
fellows
,
capt’n
,
especially
Tom
Barlow
.
<EOS>
”“Ay
<EOS>
,
he
’s
big
enough
in
all
conscience
,
”
said
Tattersall
,
remarking
that
Lord
Wilmot
’s
breadth
of
shoulder
and
athletic
proportions
seemed
materially
increased
by
his
change
of
costume
;
“
but
they
’re
both
able
-
bodied
rascals
.
<EOS>
Harkye
,
hostess
,
give
‘
em
each
a
glass
of
brandy
,
and
fill
a
pipe
for
Will
Jackson
with
this
prime
Spanish
tobacco
.
<EOS>
He
’s
too
bashful
to
help
himself
.
”“Shiver
<EOS>
my
timbers
,
but
she
shall
do
nothing
of
the
sort
!
”
<EOS>
cried
the
king
.
<EOS>
“
She
sha
n’t
turn
her
pretty
fingers
into
tobacco
stoppers
.
<EOS>
A
hand
like
this
was
never
made
for
such
work
.
”
<EOS>
And
he
pressed
it
gallantly
to
his
lips
.
<EOS>
“‘Oons
,
Will
,
I
was
wrong
,
it
seems
,
in
callin
’
thee
bashful
,
”
observed
Tattersall
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
“
Thou
seem’st
free
and
easy
enough
now
,
I
must
say
.
<EOS>
”“Well
<EOS>
,
I
declare
if
it
<EOS>
ben’t
just
like
a
play
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Mrs.
Smith
,
delighted
.
<EOS>
“I
<EOS>
hope
our
comedy
may
n’t
take
a
serious
turn
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Colonel
Gunter
,
uneasily
.
<EOS>
“
What
’s
that
?
”
<EOS>
he
added
,
as
the
tramping
of
horses
,
accompanied
by
the
clattering
of
arms
,
was
heard
in
the
inn
-
yard
.
<EOS>
Cautiously
lifting
the
edge
of
the
curtain
,
he
peeped
forth
,
and
immediately
afterwards
cried
out
in
alarm
,
“
The
Iron
-
sides
are
upon
us
!
<EOS>
Half
a
dozen
or
more
of
them
are
in
the
yard
—
and
some
are
dismounting
.
<EOS>
We
shall
have
them
here
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
”“Lord
,
preserve
us
!
<EOS>
What
’ll
become
of
the
king
?
”
<EOS>
cried
the
hostess
,
almost
sinking
with
fright
.
<EOS>
“Peace
,
Joan
!
”
said
Charles
.
<EOS>
“
My
safety
will
depend
a
good
deal
upon
your
composure
.
<EOS>
”All
had
started
to
their
feet
except
the
young
monarch
,
who
completely
maintained
his
self
-
possession
.
<EOS>
“Sit
down
all
of
you
,
”
he
said
.
<EOS>
“
Do
you
,
Wilmot
,
feign
to
be
drunk
—
sleepily
drunk
,
d’ye
understand
?
<EOS>
Gunter
,
you
must
play
the
Puritan
—
you
can
act
the
part
to
the
life
,
if
you
choose
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
as
drunk
as
Wilmot
—
but
wide
awake
.
<EOS>
”At
<EOS>
this
moment
Bonfellow
Smith
rushed
into
the
room
exclaiming
,
distractedly,“The
troopers
are
here
!
<EOS>
the
troopers
are
here
!
<EOS>
What
’s
to
be
done?”“Be
quiet
!
”
rejoined
his
wife
.
<EOS>
“
Go
and
see
what
they
are
about
!
<EOS>
We
are
all
prepared
for
them
.
<EOS>
”Overcoming
<EOS>
his
fright
as
well
as
he
could
,
Smith
left
the
room
,
and
presently
after
ominous
sounds
were
heard
without
,
announcing
that
sentinels
were
being
posted
at
the
doors
of
the
hostel
with
orders
to
shoot
any
one
who
might
attempt
to
escape
.
<EOS>
A
stern
voice
was
then
heard
in
the
passage
,
holding
a
brief
colloquy
with
the
host
,
after
which
the
door
was
thrown
open
,
and
a
sergeant
of
Ironsides
,
in
full
accoutrements
,
with
pistols
in
belt
and
drawn
sword
in
hand
,
strode
into
the
room
,
followed
by
three
others
,
armed
with
carabines
.
<EOS>
Poor
Bonfellow
Smith
did
not
venture
further
than
the
doorway
,
where
he
stood
a
terrified
spectator
of
the
scene
,
his
naturally
rosy
countenance
having
become
as
white
as
his
own
apron
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
a
great
change
had
taken
place
in
the
appearance
of
three
of
the
personages
at
the
table
.
<EOS>
Lord
Wilmot
appeared
to
be
fast
asleep
,
with
his
head
upon
the
board
,
and
Charles
,
to
judge
from
his
looks
,
was
completely
overcome
by
liquor
.
<EOS>
Never
was
the
appearance
of
a
drunken
man
better
simulated
than
by
the
king
—
head
hanging
down
—
<EOS>
eyes
half
shut
,
and
stupid
in
expression
—
limbs
wholly
unequal
to
their
office
,
since
their
owner
could
apparently
neither
rise
from
his
chair
nor
guide
the
pipe
to
his
lips
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Gunter
had
put
on
a
black
skull
-
cap
and
spectacles
,
and
smoothed
down
his
bands
.
<EOS>
By
elongating
his
features
,
he
managed
to
give
them
a
decidedly
Puritanical
expression
.
<EOS>
Delves
(
for
he
was
the
sergeant
of
Ironsides
in
question
)
marched
towards
the
group
at
the
table
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Gunter
and
Tattersall
rose
at
his
approach
,
but
the
other
two
remained
as
we
have
described
them
,
except
that
Charles
apparently
made
an
effort
to
get
up
,
and
failing
totally
,
<EOS>
seemed
to
maintain
his
balance
in
the
chair
with
difficulty
.
<EOS>
Delves
,
though
regarding
him
at
first
with
suspicion
,
could
evidently
make
nothing
of
him
,
but
turning
his
attention
to
Lord
Wilmot
,
seized
him
by
the
shoulder
,
and
shook
him
lustily
.
<EOS>
Thus
roused
,
his
lordship
looked
up
for
a
moment
with
the
vacant
stare
of
an
intoxicated
man
,
and
then
laid
his
head
down
again
.
<EOS>
“Who
are
these
drunken
fellows
?
”
<EOS>
demanded
Delves
of
Tattersall
.
<EOS>
“Two
of
my
crew
,
”
replied
the
skipper
,
“
and
both
,
I
am
sorry
to
say
,
the
worse
for
liquor
,
as
you
can
scarce
fail
to
perceive
.
<EOS>
”“It
<EOS>
is
only
too
apparent
,
”
replied
the
sergeant
,
with
a
look
of
infinite
disgust
.
<EOS>
“
How
art
thou
named
,
friend
?
”
<EOS>
he
added
to
the
skipper
.
<EOS>
“
Thy
calling
I
can
pretty
well
guess
at
.
<EOS>
”“I
have
no
reason
to
be
ashamed
either
of
my
name
or
calling
,
”
replied
Tattersall
,
bluffly
.
<EOS>
“
I
am
Nicholas
Tattersall
,
captain
of
the
Swiftsure
,
now
lying
in
Shoreham
harbour
.
<EOS>
My
papers
are
all
regular
,
if
you
desire
to
look
at
them
,
”
he
added
,
producing
a
packet
from
his
breast
.
<EOS>
“No
,
I
care
not
to
see
them
,
”
replied
Delves
.
<EOS>
“
I
am
satisfied
with
what
you
tell
me
.
<EOS>
But
mark
me
,
Nicholas
Tattersall
.
<EOS>
Certain
intelligence
has
reached
me
that
the
Young
Man
Charles
Stuart
is
in
this
neighbourhood
,
and
is
seeking
to
obtain
passage
in
some
vessel
across
the
Channel
.
<EOS>
Take
heed
thou
aidest
him
not
,
or
thou
wilt
be
hanged
as
a
traitor
.
”“Hanged
,
quotha!—hang
our
captain
!
”
<EOS>
hiccupped
Charles
.
<EOS>
Not
while
Will
Jackson
can
lift
an
arm
(
hiccup
)
.
<EOS>
If
any
man
touches
our
capt’n
(
hiccup
)
,
I
’ll
smash
him
like
this
pipe
,
”
breaking
the
pipe
to
pieces
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
“You
ought
to
put
these
two
drunkards
in
irons
,
and
give
them
a
round
dozen
apiece
in
the
morning
,
”
said
Delves
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
“I
must
take
a
lesson
from
your
service
,
”
rejoined
Tattersall
.
<EOS>
“
You
are
strict
enough
,
I
make
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
Yet
methinks
I
have
heard
of
some
delinquencies
on
the
part
of
the
troopers
at
Ovingdean
Grange
.
<EOS>
”“That
will
never
occur
again
,
”
said
Delves
,
somewhat
abashed
.
<EOS>
“
But
there
is
one
person
here
whom
I
have
not
yet
questioned
.
<EOS>
Thy
name
and
station
?
”
<EOS>
he
added
to
Colonel
Gunter
.
<EOS>
“
Take
care
thou
dost
not
equivocate
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
had
best
not
equivocate
with
you
,
sergeant
,
that
I
can
see
plainly
enough
,
”
replied
Gunter
.
<EOS>
“
My
name
is

I

the
conventicle

Ship

<EOS>
If
thou
doubtest
me

sergeant
,
appeal
to
the
host
.
<EOS>
”“Thou
art
mocking
me
,
I
suspect
,
friend
,
”
said
Delves
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
“He
<EOS>
hath
spoken
falsely
,
sergeant
,
”
said
Nathan
Guestling
,
who
was
one
of
the
troopers
standing
behind
.
<EOS>
“
He
hath
already
been
a
prisoner
in
our
hands
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
man
whom
our
captain
chased
across
the
downs
on
that
unlucky
night
,
and
brought
back
a
prisoner
to
Ovingdean
.
<EOS>
Pluck
the
spectacles
from
off
his
nose
,
and
the
cap
from
off
his
head
,
and
thou
wilt
instantly
recognize
him
.
<EOS>
I
knew
him
at
once
.
<EOS>
”“Thou
<EOS>
art
right
,
Nathan!—it
is
he
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Delves
.
<EOS>
“
I
am
glad
we
shall
not
go
away
empty
-
handed
.
<EOS>
Thou
art
my
prisoner
,
”
he
added
to
Colonel
Gunter
;
“
come
forth
,
or
my
men
will
fire
upon
thee
.
<EOS>
”“Nay
,
I
will
come
peaceably
,
”
replied
Gunter
,
stepping
forward
.
<EOS>
Nathan
Guestling
and
Besadaiah
(
for
the
latter
also
was
present
)
placed
themselves
one
on
either
side
of
the
prisoner
,
and
in
this
manner
he
was
led
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
But
just
as
he
was
going
forth
he
whispered
to
the
landlord
that
he
felt
certain
of
a
rescue
,
and
would
be
back
again
ere
long
.
<EOS>
Shortly
afterwards
,
a
trampling
in
the
inn
-
yard
announced
the
departure
of
the
troopers
,
and
the
host
came
in
to
say
they
were
gone
—
though
the
satisfactory
intelligence
was
somewhat
damped
by
the
thought
that
Colonel
Gunter
had
been
carried
off
a
captive
.

CHAPTER
IVContaining
Particulars
Of
The
Conflict
On
Kingston
Hill
,
And
Of
The
Embarkation
At
ShorehamCHARLES
would
have
been
greatly
troubled
by
the
loss
of
his
faithful
adherent
,
had
he
not
felt
almost
certain
that
Gunter
would
be
rescued
by
Clavering
and
the
other
Royalists
hovering
about
the
town
,
and
that
he
should
see
him
again
before
he
started
for
Shoreham
.
<EOS>
Lord
Wilmot
was
also
of
the
same
opinion
.
<EOS>
Whatever
Tattersall
might
secretly
think
of
the
chances
in
the
colonel
’s
favour
<EOS>
he
kept
his
sentiments
to
himself
,
and
continued
to
puff
away
at
his
pipe
;
but
the
host
and
hostess
were
loud
in
their
expressions
of
delight
at
his
Majesty
’s
providential
escape
.
<EOS>
“I
owe
my
safety
entirely
to
Captain
Tattersall
,
”
observed
Charles
.
<EOS>
“
Had
he
not
brought
these
disguises
with
him
,
Lord
Wilmot
and
I
should
have
been
infallibly
detected
.
<EOS>
”“It
<EOS>
was
lucky
I
thought
of
them
,
”
replied
Tattersall
,
quietly
.
<EOS>
Shortly
after
this
,
a
very
nice
little
supper
was
placed
on
the
table
by
the
hostess
,
to
which
both
the
monarch
and
his
companions
did
ample
justice
.
<EOS>
A
glass
or
two
of
choice
canary
,
poured
out
for
him
by
Mrs.
Smith
,
quickly
dispelled
the
king
’s
gloom
,
and
before
the
repast
was
over
he
had
regained
his
customary
spirits
,
and
was
laughing
and
talking
as
merrily
as
ever
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
table
was
cleared
,
pipes
and
tobacco
were
again
introduced
.
<EOS>
A
jug
of
cold
water
and
a
bottle
of
right
Nantz
were
placed
near
Captain
Tattersall
,
but
Charles
and
Lord
Wilmot
confined
their
potations
to
canary
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
now
getting
late
,
and
all
the
other
guests
in
the
house
had
long
since
left
,
the
inn
doors
were
locked
,
and
the
servants
,
who
were
no
longer
required
,
were
sent
to
bed
.
<EOS>
By
his
Majesty
’s
special
invitation
,
the
host
and
hostess
joined
the
party
in
the
parlour
,
and
it
was
ever
afterwards
a
subject
of
infinite
gratulation
to
them
that
they
had
been
allowed
to
sit
down
in
his
Majesty
’s
presence
.
<EOS>
Captain
Tattersall
,
who
was
of
a
jovial
turn
,
did
his
best
to
amuse
the
company
—
sang
nautical
ballads
,
and
related
droll
incidents
in
his
own
career
,
at
which
the
king
laughed
heartily
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
time
passed
quickly
away
.
<EOS>
It
had
now
struck
one
o’clock
.
<EOS>
Nothing
had
been
heard
of
Clavering
Maunsel
and
his
party
,
and
Charles
almost
began
to
despair
of
seeing
Colonel
Gunter
again
.
<EOS>
“In
<EOS>
another
hour
your
Majesty
will
be
thinking
of
starting
,
I
presume
,
”
observed
Tattersall
.
<EOS>
“True
,
”
replied
Charles
,
looking
at
the
clock
;
<EOS>
“
I
did
not
think
it
was
so
late
.
<EOS>
But
I
hope
our
friends
will
be
here
before
then
.
<EOS>
”“They
are
here
now
,
or
I
am
much
mistaken
,
”
cried
Lord
Wilmot
,
starting
up
,
as
the
sound
of
horses
’
feet
was
heard
in
the
inn
-
yard
.
<EOS>
“Look
out
,
and
make
sure
that
the
Ironsides
have
not
returned
,
”
said
Charles
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
obeyed
,
and
after
cautiously
peering
through
the
window
-
curtain
,
declared
it
was
Clavering
Maunsel
and
the
others
.
<EOS>
“
And
I
am
almost
certain
<EOS>
Gunter
is
with
them
,
”
added
his
lordship
.
<EOS>
“Now
heaven
be
thanked
!
”
<EOS>
exclaimed
Charles
.
<EOS>
“
That
is
good
news
indeed!”At
this
moment
,
a
cautious
knocking
was
heard
at
the
yard
door
.
<EOS>
“Admit
them
straight
<EOS>
,
my
good
host
,
”
cried
the
king
.
<EOS>
And
Smith
flew
to
execute
his
Majesty
’s
commands
.
<EOS>
Immediately
afterwards
quick
footsteps
were
heard
in
the
passage
,
and
Colonel
Gunter
and
Clavering
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
They
were
followed
in
another
moment
by
Colonel
Philips
and
Captain
Gunter
,
and
three
other
persons
,
who
remained
in
the
background
.
<EOS>
“I
am
as
good
as
my
word
<EOS>
,
you
see
,
my
gracious
liege
,
”
said
Colonel
Gunter
.
<EOS>
“
I
promised
to
be
back
before
your
Majesty
left
,
and
here
I
am
.
<EOS>
”“And
delighted
I
am
to
see
you
again
,
”
replied
the
king
.
<EOS>
“
But
how
did
you
manage
to
escape
from
those
rascally
Ironsides?”“My
friends
rescued
me
,
as
I
felt
sure
they
would
,
”
rejoined
Gunter
,
pointing
to
Clavering
and
the
others
;
“
but
they
had
hard
work
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
”“So
<EOS>
it
would
seem
,
”
replied
Charles
,
noticing
that
the
young
man
and
those
near
him
bore
marks
of
a
recent
and
severe
conflict
.
<EOS>
“
Tell
me
how
it
chanced?”“Your
Majesty
has
some
enemies
the
less
,
”
replied
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“
But
you
have
lost
one
faithful
subject
,
”
he
added
,
gravely
.
<EOS>
“How
?
”
exclaimed
Charles
,
glancing
at
the
group
in
the
background
.
<EOS>
“
I
discover
not
stout
John
Habergeon
.
<EOS>
Is
he
gone?”“Ay
,
my
liege
,
”
Clavering
replied
.
<EOS>
“
He
died
like
a
brave
and
loyal
man
,
sword
in
hand
,
smiting
the
enemies
of
his
king
.
<EOS>
Thus
it
fell
out
:
I
and
those
with
me
were
aware
of
the
visit
of
the
Iron
-
sides
to
this
inn
,
for
we
were
scouting
about
the
town
;
but
we
did
not
think
it
prudent
to
attack
them
,
lest
the
townsfolk
should
come
to
their
aid
.
<EOS>
Ensconced
where
we
could
observe
them
,
we
saw
them
issue
forth
with
a
single
prisoner
—
your
Majesty
<EOS>
we
feared
it
might
be
.
<EOS>
But
be
it
whom
it
might
,
we
resolved
upon
a
rescue
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
mention
,
that
we
had
been
joined
by
three
recruits
,
two
of
whom
are
here
present
,
and
who
rendered
us
good
service
.
<EOS>
The
Ironsides
left
Brightelmstone
,
and
rode
across
the
downs
in
the
direction
of
Lewes
.
<EOS>
We
followed
,
but
did
not
come
up
with
them
until
they
reached
Kingston
Hill
.
<EOS>
We
then
shouted
loudly
to
them
to
stop
,
and
they
drew
up
and
awaited
our
approach
.
<EOS>
Sword
in
hand
we
charged
them
—
your
name
,
my
liege
,
forming
our
battle
-
cry
.
<EOS>
So
furious
was
our
assault
that
it
proved
irresistible
.
<EOS>
The
shock
scattered
them
,
and
a
hand
-
to
-
hand
conflict
ensued
—
such
a
conflict
as
,
since
the
days
of
the
old
Romans
,
I
verily
believe
that
hill
hath
never
seen-
<EOS>
The
turf
is
reddened
with
the
blood
of
your
enemies
,
sire
.
<EOS>
We
were
triumphant
.
<EOS>
Half
a
dozen
Ironsides
now
lie
stark
upon
Kingston
Hill
.
<EOS>
Amongst
them
,
alas
!
<EOS>
is
John
Habergeon
.
<EOS>
But
he
sold
his
life
dearly
.
<EOS>
Three
of
our
foemen
—
their
sergeant
Delves
being
among
the
number
—
fell
by
his
hand
.
<EOS>
Give
me
a
glass
of
wine
,
my
good
hostess
.
<EOS>
I
am
somewhat
faint
.
<EOS>
”“That
<EOS>
task
be
mine
,
”
cried
Charles
,
filling
a
glass
for
him
.
<EOS>
“
You
have
gained
a
glorious
victory
,
but
I
would
it
had
not
been
purchased
by
the
death
of
John
Habergeon
.
<EOS>
”“He
died
as
he
would
have
wished
to
die
—
with
your
Majesty
’s
name
upon
his
lips
,
”
rejoined
Clavering
.
<EOS>
Charles
was
silent
for
a
moment
,
and
then
said
:
“
A
brave
fellow
is
gone
,
but
he
has
left
good
men
behind
him
.
<EOS>
I
am
glad
to
see
that
Ninian
Saxby
has
escaped
unhurt—”“Not
altogether
unhurt
,
an
please
your
majesty
,
”
replied
Ninian
,
stepping
forward
.
<EOS>
“
I
have
received
a
few
sharp
cuts
,
but
nothing
to
signify
.
<EOS>
I
gave
the
Roundheaded
rogues
as
good
as
they
brought,—and
better!”“I
doubt
it
not
,
”
said
Charles
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
“
Thou
art
a
brave
lad
.
<EOS>
But
what
do
I
see
?
<EOS>
Surely
these
are
the
gentlemen
whom
I
met
at
Steyning?”“Your
Majesty
is
in
the
right
,
”
replied
Goldspur
,
coming
forward
and
making
an
obeisance
.
<EOS>
“
I
and
my
friend
Jervoise
Rumboldsdyke
have
been
anxious
to
approve
our
loyalty
,
and
at
length
we
have
found
occasion
for
doing
so
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Clavering
Maunsel
will
declare
whether
we
have
comported
ourselves
well
or
not
.
<EOS>
”“Both
<EOS>
gentlemen
behaved
with
great
bravery
,
sire
,
”
said
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“I
am
glad
to
hear
it
,
”
said
the
king
.
<EOS>
“
I
only
wish
I
could
reward
you
according
to
your
deserts
.
<EOS>
But
my
exchequer
is
pretty
much
in
the
same
state
as
your
own
.
<EOS>
”“Our
exchequer
is
better
furnished
than
your
Majesty
supposes
,
”
rejoined
Goldspur
;
“
that
is
,
it
will
be
so
to
-
morrow

”
he
added
,
correcting
himself
.
<EOS>
“
A
rascally
porter
,
named
Skrow
Antram
,
who
served
old
Zachary
Trangmar
,
the
rich
usurer
of
Lewes
,
joined
us
this
evening
,
and
was
shot
in
the
fight
on
Kingston
Hill
.
<EOS>
With
his
dying
breath
he
confessed
to
me
and
my
friend
Rumboldsdyke
that
he
had
robbed
the
old
usurer
his
master
,
and
told
us
where
he
had
hidden
the
gold
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
we
shall
visit
old
Zachary
,
and
make
a
bargain
with
him
for
the
discovery
of
the
treasure
.
<EOS>
The
old
usurer
must
come
down
handsomely
,
for
his
porter
had
purloined
a
good
round
sum
.
<EOS>
”“Well
<EOS>
resolved
,
”
replied
Charles
.
<EOS>
“
I
am
sure
you
will
not
make
yourselves
accomplices
of
the
rogue
Antram
,
and
sully
your
honour
as
Cavaliers
by
appropriating
the
treasure
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
Captain
Tattersall
,
there
is
no
need
to
tarry
longer
here
.
<EOS>
Let
us
to
Shoreham
.
<EOS>
These
gentlemen
will
go
with
us
,
and
constitute
my
escort
.
<EOS>
”“I
am
at
your
Majesty
’s
disposal
,
”
replied
the
skipper
.
<EOS>
“Farewell
,
then
,
my
worthy
host

hostess

”
said
Charles
.
<EOS>
“
Rest
assured
I
shall
often
think
of
the
eventful
night
I
have
spent
at
the
George
at
Brightelmstone
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
shall
venture
to
remind
your

of

said
Smith
.
<EOS>
“You

buxom
Joan

<EOS>
Harkye

gentlemen

he
amongst

give
Captain

<EOS>
”“Then
<EOS>

take

”
said
Colonel
Philips
,
“
for
I
am
well
mounted

<EOS>
”“Give
<EOS>
me
thy
purse
,
Wilmot
,
”
said
the
king
.
<EOS>
And
on
receiving
it
,
he
took
forth
five
gold
pieces
,
and
placed
them
in
the
hostess
’s
hands
.
<EOS>
“
There
is
for
the
reckoning
,
bonny
Joan
.
<EOS>
One
kiss
at
parting
,
and
then
adieu!”Charles
then
left
the
room
,
and
was
attended
to
the
yard
by
both
host
and
hostess
,
neither
of
whom
would
leave
him
till
he
took
his
departure
.
<EOS>
Honest
Smith
prayed
that
every
blessing
might
attend
his
Majesty
,
coupled
with
a
hope
that
the
George
might
speedily
be
again
honoured
by
his
presence
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Smith
’s
sobs
prevented
her
from
saying
anything
.
<EOS>
At
length
all
the
party
were
mounted
,
Captain
Tattersall
being
accommodated
with
a
seat
behind
Colonel
Philips
.
<EOS>
The
king
then
gave
the
word
to
start
,
and
bade
adieu
to
the
host
and
hostess
,
giving
his
hand
to
the
latter
,
who
bathed
it
with
her
tears
,
while
pressing
it
to
her
lips
.
<EOS>
The
cavalcade
being
then
put
in
motion
,
took
the
road
along
the
coast
through
Hove
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
fine
,
clear
,
starlight
night
,
with
the
wind
blowing
freshly
from
the
north
-
east
.
<EOS>
In
little
more
than
half
an
hour
the
troop
approached
Shoreham
,
no
misadventure
or
hindrance
of
any
kind
having
occurred
to
them
.
<EOS>
Captain
Tattersall
now
directed
the
king
’s
attention
to
a
vessel
which
could
just
be
distinguished
lying
out
at
sea
,
at
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
’s
distance
,
and
informed
him
it
was
the
Swiftsure
.
<EOS>
A
halt
was
then
called
.
<EOS>
Charles
dismounted
,
and
bade
adieu
to
his
followers
,
thanking
them
all
warmly
for
their
services
,
and
saying
something
kindly
to
each
.
<EOS>
His
last
words
were
reserved
for
Clavering
Maunsel
.
<EOS>
Bidding
the
young
man
remember
him
to
his
father
,
he
added
,
“
And
fail
not
to
commend
me
to
good
Mr.
Beard
and
fair
Mistress
Dulcia
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
,
I
hope
to
hear
of
your
union
with
the
object
of
your
wishes
.
”By
<EOS>
this
time
Lord
Wilmot
and
Captain
Tattersall
had
dismounted
.
<EOS>
The
skipper
then
walked
on
in
advance
,
leaving
the
king
and
his
lordship
to
follow
.
<EOS>
After
crossing
a
heavy
bank
of
shingle
,
they
reached
the
edge
of
a
little
creek
divided
by
an
outer
bank
from
the
sea
.
<EOS>
Tattersall
then
gave
a
low
whistle
,
in
reply
to
which
the
sound
of
oars
was
heard
,
and
a
boat
was
seen
advancing
from
under
the
shade
of
the
opposite
bank
.
<EOS>
This
boat
,
which
was
manned
by
a
couple
of
stout
-
looking
seamen
,
soon
touched
the
strand
.
<EOS>
The
king
and
Lord
Wilmot
leaped
into
it
,
and
were
quickly
followed
by
Tattersall
,
who
seated
himself
in
the
stern
.
<EOS>
The
men
then
plying
their
oars
briskly
,
the
boat
was
soon
out
of
the
creek
,
and
cleaving
its
way
through
the
sea
.
<EOS>
In
ten
minutes
more
they
were
beside
the
Swiftsure
.
<EOS>
Charles
sprang
up
the
vessel
’s
side
as
actively
as
any
seaman
could
have
performed
the
feat
,
and
was
followed
by
the
two
others
,
while
the
boat
pulled
off
again
to
shore
.
<EOS>
The
king
then
looked
towards
the
group
of
horsemen
,
whom
he
could
dimly
discern
on
the
beach
and
a
joyful
shout
reached
his
ears
.
<EOS>
The
brig
then
stood
out
to
sea
,
and
Charles
was
safely
landed
on
the
morning
of
the
following
day
at
Fécamp
.
<EOS>
L’ENVOYTHE
king
’s
recommendation
was
not
neglected
.
<EOS>
Ere
the
year
was
out
,
Clavering
was
made
happy
with
the
hand
of
the
fair
Dulcia
,
and
had
no
reason
to
repent
his
choice
.
<EOS>
Charles
,
we
need
scarcely
say
,
had
to
wait
nine
years
for
the
Restoration
,
and
long
before
that
auspicious
event
,
Colonel
Maunsel
was
gathered
to
his
fathers
.
<EOS>
But
good
Mr.
Beard
lived
to
be
reinstated
in
his
living
,
and
again
officiated
in
the
little
village
church
.
<EOS>
He
took
for
the
text
of
the
first
sermon
preached
by
him
on
resuming
his
duties
,
these
verses
from
the
129th
Psalm
:
“
The
plowers
plowed
upon
my
back
;
they
made
long
their
furrows.—The
Lord
is
righteous
:
<EOS>
he
hath
cut
asunder
the
cords
of
the
wicked
.
<EOS>
”Clavering
<EOS>
and
Dulcia
continued
to
reside
at
Ovingdean
Grange
to
the
close
of
their
days
,
which
extended
in
both
instances
into
another
century
.
<EOS>
Though
the
Maunsel
family
is
now
extinct
in
the
direct
line
,
worthy
representatives
are
left
—
both
at
Rottingdean
and
Lewes
—
of
the
good
old
stock
of
the
BEARDS
.
<EOS>
And
we
may
add
,
that
the
old
house
at
Ovingdean
still
belongs
to
a
branch
of
the
same
family
.
<EOS>
Stelfax
,
at
that
time
a
colonel
in
the
Guards
,
and
in
high
favour
with
Monk
,
formed
part
of
the
royal
escort
from
Blackheath
,
on
the
glorious
29th
of
May
,
1660
,
when
the
king
made
his
triumphal
entry
into
London
.
<EOS>
Charles
particularly
distinguished
him
,
and
good
-
humouredly
observed
,
“
Have
you
forgotten
the
half-
hour
we
spent
together
in
the
hiding
-
place
at
Ovingdean
,
colonel?”“I
have
forgotten
all
,
except
your
Majesty
’s
generosity
,
”
replied
Stelfax
,
bending
to
the
saddle
-
bow
.
<EOS>
He
was
already
,
we
may
perceive
,
a
courtier
.
<EOS>
Ninian
Saxby
became
the
fortunate
possessor
of
Patty
Whinchat
,
and
was
blessed
with
a
numerous
progeny
.
<EOS>
After
his
father
’s
death
he
filled
the
post
of
ostreger
to
Clavering
,
who
grew
passionately
fond
of
all
country
sports
.
<EOS>
Some
of
Ninian
’s
descendants
,
we
believe
,
may
be
found
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Ovingdean
to
this
day
.
<EOS>
The
body
of
stout
old
John
Habergeon
was
removed
from
Kingston
Hill
,
and
buried
in
the
village
churchyard
.
<EOS>
Peace
be
with
him!Captain
Tattersall
received
a
considerable
sum
for
his
services
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
a
pension
of
a
hundred
a
year
was
settled
upon
him
and
his
descendants
;
and
he
was
likewise
presented
with
a
handsome
ring
by
the
grateful
monarch
.
<EOS>
Would
you
know
more
of
the
worthy
skipper
’s
virtues
,
go
seek
his
monument
in
the
old
parish
churchyard
at
Brighton
!
<EOS>
There
you
may
read
the
following
epitaph
:
Within
this
marble
monument
doth
lieApproved
faith
,
honour
,
and
loyalty

<EOS>
In
this
cold
clay
he
now
has
ta’en
his
station
,
That
once
preserved
the
church
,
the
crown
,
and
nation
.
<EOS>
When
Charles
the
great
was
nothing
but
a
breath
,
This
valiant
soul
stept
between
him
and
death

glorious

<EOS>
Bonfellow
Smith
had
gone
the
way
of
all
flesh
before
that
most
festive
time
,
when
—
to
the
infinite
satisfaction
of
all
landlords
—
universal
England
drunk
did
get
—
<EOS>
For
joy
that
Charles
,
her
monarch
,
was
restored
.
<EOS>
But
his
still
buxom
widow
at
once
took
down
the
old
sign
of
the
George
,
and
set
up
in
its
place
King
Charles
the
Second
’s
Head
.
<EOS>
If
Clavering
’s
services
were
not
more
fully
requited
,
it
was
his
own
fault
rather
than
that
of
his
sovereign
.
<EOS>
Charles
endeavoured
to
persuade
him
to
quit
his
seclusion
and
come
to
court
,
offering
him
knighthood
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
too
happy
at
Ovingdean
Grange
to
leave
it
,
and
respectfully
declined
the
honour
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
he
had
become
,
what
he
continued
to
remain
to
the
last
,
A
fishing
,
hawking
,
hunting
,
Country
Gentleman
.

THE
END
