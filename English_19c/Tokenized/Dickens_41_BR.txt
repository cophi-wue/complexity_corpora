<EOS>
In
the
year
1775
,
there
stood
upon
the
borders
of
Epping
Forest
,
at
a
distance
of
about
twelve
miles
from
London
---
measuring
from
the
Standard
in
Cornhill
,
"
or
rather
from
the
spot
on
or
near
to
which
the
Standard
used
to
be
in
days
of
yore
---
a
house
of
public
entertainment
called
the
Maypole
;
which
fact
was
demonstrated
to
all
such
travellers
as
could
neither
read
nor
write
(
and
at
that
time
a
vast
number
both
of
travellers
and
stay
-
at
-
homes
were
in
this
condition
)
by
the
emblem
reared
on
the
roadside
over
against
the
house
,
which
,
if
not
of
those
goodly
proportions
that
Maypoles
were
wo
nt
to
present
in
olden
times
,
was
a
fair
young
ash
,
thirty
feet
in
height
,
and
straight
as
any
arrow
that
ever
English
yeoman
drew
.
  
<EOS>
The
Maypole
---
by
which
term
from
henceforth
is
meant
the
house
,
and
not
its
sign
---
the
Maypole
was
an
old
building
,
with
more
gable
ends
than
a
lazy
man
would
care
to
count
on
a
sunny
day
;
huge
zig
-
zag
chimneys
,
out
of
which
it
seemed
as
though
even
smoke
could
not
choose
but
come
in
more
than
naturally
fantastic
shapes
,
imparted
to
it
in
its
tortuous
progress
;
and
vast
stables
,
gloomy
,
ruinous
,
and
empty
.
 
<EOS>
The
place
was
said
to
have
been
built
in
the
days
of
King
Henry
the
Eighth
;
and
there
was
a
legend
,
not
only
that
Queen
Elizabeth
had
slept
there
one
night
while
upon
a
hunting
excursion
,
to
wit
,
in
a
certain
oak
-
panelled
room
with
a
deep
bay
window
,
but
that
next
morning
,
while
standing
on
a
mounting
block
before
the
door
with
one
foot
in
the
stirrup
,
the
virgin
monarch
had
then
and
there
boxed
and
cuffed
an
unlucky
page
for
some
neglect
of
duty
.
<EOS>
The
matter
-
of
-
fact
and
doubtful
folks
,
of
whom
there
were
a
few
among
the
Maypole
customers
,
as
unluckily
there
always
are
in
every
little
community
,
were
inclined
to
look
upon
this
tradition
as
rather
apocryphal
;
but
,
whenever
the
landlord
of
that
ancient
hostelry
appealed
to
the
mounting
block
itself
as
evidence
,
and
triumphantly
pointed
out
that
there
it
stood
in
the
same
place
to
that
very
day
,
the
doubters
never
failed
to
be
put
down
by
a
large
majority
,
and
all
true
believers
exulted
as
in
a
victory
.
  
<EOS>
Whether
these
,
and
many
other
stories
of
the
like
nature
,
were
true
or
untrue
,
the
Maypole
was
really
an
old
house
,
a
very
old
house
,
perhaps
as
old
as
it
claimed
to
be
,
and
perhaps
older
,
which
will
sometimes
happen
with
houses
of
an
uncertain
,
as
with
ladies
of
a
certain
,
age
.
 
<EOS>
Its
windows
were
old
diamond
-
pane
lattices
,
its
floors
were
sunken
and
uneven
,
its
ceilings
blackened
by
the
hand
of
time
,
and
heavy
with
massive
beams
.
 
<EOS>
Over
the
doorway
was
an
ancient
porch
,
quaintly
and
grotesquely
carved
;
and
here
on
summer
evenings
the
more
favoured
customers
smoked
and
drank
---
ay
,
and
sang
many
a
good
song
too
,
sometimes
---
reposing
on
two
grim
-
looking
high
-
backed
settles
,
which
,
like
the
twin
dragons
of
some
fairy
tale
,
guarded
the
entrance
to
the
mansion
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
chimneys
of
the
disused
rooms
,
swallows
had
built
their
nests
for
many
a
long
year
,
and
from
earliest
spring
to
latest
autumn
whole
colonies
of
sparrows
chirped
and
twittered
in
the
eaves
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
more
pigeons
about
the
dreary
stable
-
yard
and
out
-
buildings
than
anybody
but
the
landlord
could
reckon
up
.
 
<EOS>
The
wheeling
and
circling
flights
of
runts
,
fantails
,
tumblers
,
and
pouters
,
were
perhaps
not
quite
consistent
with
the
grave
and
sober
character
of
the
building
,
but
the
monotonous
cooing
,
which
never
ceased
to
be
raised
by
some
among
them
all
day
long
,
suited
it
exactly
,
and
seemed
to
lull
it
to
rest
.
 
<EOS>
With
its
overhanging
stories
,
drowsy
little
panes
of
glass
,
and
front
bulging
out
and
projecting
over
the
pathway
,
the
old
house
looked
as
if
it
were
nodding
in
its
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
it
needed
no
very
great
stretch
of
fancy
to
detect
in
it
other
resemblances
to
humanity
.
 
<EOS>
The
bricks
of
which
it
was
built
had
originally
been
a
deep
dark
red
,
but
had
grown
yellow
and
discoloured
like
an
old
man
's
skin
;
the
sturdy
timbers
had
decayed
like
teeth
;
and
here
<EOS>
and
there
the
ivy
,
like
a
warm
garment
to
comfort
it
in
its
age
,
wrapt
its
green
leaves
closely
round
the
time
-
worn
walls
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
hale
and
hearty
age
though
,
still
:
and
in
the
summer
or
autumn
evenings
,
when
the
glow
of
the
setting
sun
fell
upon
the
oak
and
chestnut
trees
of
the
adjacent
forest
,
the
old
house
,
partaking
of
its
lustre
,
seemed
their
fit
companion
,
and
to
have
many
good
years
of
life
in
him
yet
.
  
<EOS>
The
evening
with
which
we
have
to
do
,
was
neither
a
summer
nor
an
autumn
one
,
but
the
twilight
of
a
day
in
March
,
when
the
wind
howled
dismally
among
the
bare
branches
of
the
trees
,
and
rumbling
in
the
wide
chimneys
and
driving
the
rain
against
the
windows
of
the
Maypole
Inn
,
gave
such
of
its
frequenters
as
chanced
to
be
there
at
the
moment
an
undeniable
reason
for
prolonging
their
stay
,
and
caused
the
landlord
to
prophesy
that
the
night
would
certainly
clear
at
eleven
o'clock
precisely
,
---
which
by
a
remarkable
coincidence
was
the
hour
at
which
he
always
closed
his
house
.
  
<EOS>
The
name
of
him
upon
whom
the
spirit
of
prophecy
thus
descended
was
John
Willet
,
a
burly
,
large
-
headed
man
with
a
fat
face
,
which
betokened
profound
obstinacy
and
slowness
of
apprehension
,
combined
with
a
very
strong
reliance
upon
his
own
merits
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
John
Willet
's
ordinary
boast
in
his
more
placid
moods
that
if
he
were
slow
he
was
sure
;
which
assertion
could
,
in
one
sense
at
least
,
be
by
no
means
gainsaid
,
seeing
that
he
was
in
everything
unquestionably
the
reverse
of
fast
,
and
withal
one
of
the
most
dogged
and
positive
fellows
in
existence
---
<EOS>
always
sure
that
what
he
thought
or
said
or
did
was
right
,
and
holding
it
as
a
thing
quite
settled
and
ordained
by
the
laws
of
nature
and
Providence
,
that
anybody
who
said
or
did
or
thought
otherwise
must
be
inevitably
and
of
necessity
wrong
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Willet
walked
slowly
up
to
the
window
,
flattened
his
fat
nose
against
the
cold
glass
,
and
shading
his
eyes
that
his
sight
might
not
be
affected
by
the
ruddy
glow
of
the
fire
,
looked
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
walked
slowly
back
to
his
old
seat
in
the
chimney
-
corner
,
and
,
composing
himself
in
it
with
a
slight
shiver
,
such
as
a
man
might
give
way
to
<EOS>
and
so
acquire
an
additional
relish
for
the
warm
blaze
,
said
,
looking
round
upon
his
guests
:
  
<EOS>
"
It
'll
clear
at
eleven
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
No
sooner
and
no
later
.
 
<EOS>
Not
before
and
not
arterwards
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
make
out
that
?
"
said
a
little
man
in
the
opposite
corner
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
moon
is
past
the
full
,
and
she
rises
at
nine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
John
looked
sedately
and
solemnly
at
his
questioner
until
he
had
brought
his
mind
to
bear
upon
the
whole
of
his
observation
,
and
then
made
answer
,
in
a
tone
which
seemed
to
imply
that
the
moon
was
peculiarly
his
business
and
nobody
else
's
:
  
<EOS>
"
Never
you
mind
about
the
moon
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
trouble
yourself
about
her
.
 
<EOS>
You
let
the
moon
alone
,
and
I
'll
let
you
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
offence
I
hope
?
"
said
the
little
man
.
  
<EOS>
Again
John
waited
leisurely
until
the
observation
had
thoroughly
penetrated
to
his
brain
,
and
then
replying
,
"
No
offence
as
YET
,
"
applied
a
light
to
his
pipe
and
smoked
in
placid
silence
;
now
and
then
casting
a
sidelong
look
at
a
man
wrapped
in
a
loose
riding
-
coat
with
huge
cuffs
ornamented
with
tarnished
silver
lace
and
large
metal
buttons
,
who
sat
apart
from
the
regular
frequenters
of
the
house
,
and
wearing
a
hat
flapped
over
his
face
,
which
was
still
further
shaded
by
the
hand
on
which
his
forehead
rested
,
looked
unsociable
enough
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
another
guest
,
who
sat
,
booted
and
spurred
,
at
some
distance
from
the
fire
also
,
and
whose
thoughts
---
to
judge
from
his
folded
arms
and
knitted
brows
,
and
from
the
untasted
liquor
before
him
---
were
occupied
with
other
matters
than
the
topics
under
discussion
or
the
persons
who
discussed
them
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
a
young
man
of
about
eight
-
and
-
twenty
,
rather
above
the
middle
height
,
and
though
of
somewhat
slight
figure
,
gracefully
and
strongly
made
.
 
<EOS>
He
wore
his
own
dark
hair
,
and
was
accoutred
in
a
riding
dress
,
which
together
with
his
large
boots
(
resembling
in
shape
and
fashion
those
worn
by
our
Life
Guardsmen
at
the
present
day
)
,
showed
indisputable
traces
of
the
bad
condition
of
the
roads
.
 
<EOS>
But
travel
-
stained
though
he
was
<EOS>
,
he
was
well
and
even
richly
attired
,
and
without
being
overdressed
looked
a
gallant
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
Lying
upon
the
table
beside
him
,
as
he
had
carelessly
thrown
them
down
,
were
a
heavy
riding
-
whip
and
a
slouched
hat
,
the
latter
worn
no
doubt
as
being
best
suited
to
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
.
<EOS>
There
,
too
,
were
a
pair
of
pistols
in
a
holster
-
case
,
and
a
short
riding
-
cloak
.
 
<EOS>
Little
of
his
face
was
visible
,
except
the
long
dark
lashes
which
concealed
his
downcast
eyes
,
but
an
air
of
careless
ease
and
natural
gracefulness
of
demeanour
pervaded
the
figure
,
and
seemed
to
comprehend
even
those
slight
accessories
,
which
were
all
handsome
,
and
in
good
keeping
.
  
<EOS>
Towards
this
young
gentleman
the
eyes
of
Mr
Willet
wandered
but
once
,
and
then
as
if
in
mute
inquiry
whether
he
had
observed
his
silent
neighbour
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
plain
that
John
and
the
young
gentleman
had
often
met
before
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
that
his
look
was
not
returned
,
or
indeed
observed
by
the
person
to
whom
it
was
addressed
,
John
gradually
concentrated
the
whole
power
of
his
eyes
into
one
focus
,
and
brought
it
to
bear
upon
the
man
in
the
flapped
hat
,
at
whom
he
came
to
stare
in
course
of
time
with
an
intensity
so
remarkable
,
that
it
affected
his
fireside
cronies
,
who
all
,
as
with
one
accord
,
took
their
pipes
from
their
lips
,
and
stared
with
open
mouths
at
the
stranger
likewise
.
  
<EOS>
The
sturdy
landlord
had
a
large
pair
of
dull
fish
-
like
eyes
,
and
the
little
man
who
had
hazarded
the
remark
about
the
moon
(
and
who
was
the
parish
-
clerk
and
bell
-
ringer
of
Chigwell
,
a
village
hard
by
)
had
little
round
black
shiny
eyes
like
beads
;
moreover
this
little
man
wore
at
the
knees
of
his
rusty
black
breeches
,
and
on
his
rusty
black
coat
,
and
all
down
his
long
flapped
waistcoat
,
little
queer
buttons
like
nothing
except
his
eyes
;
<EOS>
but
so
like
them
,
that
as
they
twinkled
and
glistened
in
the
light
of
the
fire
,
which
shone
too
in
his
bright
shoe
-
buckles
,
he
seemed
all
eyes
from
head
to
foot
,
and
to
be
gazing
with
every
one
of
them
at
the
unknown
customer
.
 
<EOS>
No
wonder
that
a
man
should
grow
restless
under
such
an
inspection
as
this
,
to
say
nothing
of
the
eyes
belonging
to
short
Tom
Cobb
the
general
chandler
and
post
-
office
keeper
,
and
long
Phil
Parkes
the
ranger
,
both
of
whom
,
infected
by
the
example
of
their
companions
,
regarded
him
of
the
flapped
hat
no
less
attentively
.
  
<EOS>
The
stranger
became
restless
;
perhaps
from
being
exposed
to
this
raking
fire
of
eyes
,
perhaps
from
the
nature
of
his
previous
meditations
---
most
probably
from
the
latter
cause
,
for
as
he
changed
his
position
and
looked
hastily
round
,
he
started
to
find
himself
the
object
of
such
keen
regard
,
and
darted
an
angry
and
suspicious
glance
at
the
fireside
group
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
the
effect
of
immediately
diverting
all
eyes
to
the
chimney
,
except
those
of
John
Willet
,
who
finding
himself
as
it
were
,
caught
in
the
fact
,
and
not
being
(
as
has
been
already
observed
)
of
a
very
ready
nature
,
remained
staring
at
his
guest
in
a
particularly
awkward
and
disconcerted
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
said
the
stranger
.
  
<EOS>
Well
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
not
much
in
well
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
a
long
speech
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
gave
an
order
,
"
said
the
landlord
,
after
a
pause
of
two
or
three
minutes
for
consideration
.
  
<EOS>
The
stranger
took
off
his
hat
,
and
disclosed
the
hard
features
of
a
man
of
sixty
or
thereabouts
,
much
weatherbeaten
and
worn
by
time
,
and
the
naturally
harsh
expression
of
which
was
not
improved
by
a
dark
handkerchief
which
was
bound
tightly
round
his
head
,
and
,
while
it
served
the
purpose
of
a
wig
,
shaded
his
forehead
,
and
almost
hid
his
eyebrows
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
were
intended
to
conceal
or
divert
attention
from
a
deep
gash
,
now
healed
into
an
ugly
seam
,
which
when
it
was
first
inflicted
must
have
laid
bare
his
cheekbone
,
the
object
was
but
indifferently
attained
,
<EOS>
for
it
could
scarcely
fail
to
be
noted
at
a
glance
.
 
<EOS>
His
complexion
was
of
a
cadaverous
hue
,
and
he
had
a
grizzly
jagged
beard
of
some
three
weeks
'
date
.
 
<EOS>
Such
was
the
figure
(
very
meanly
and
poorly
clad
)
that
now
rose
from
the
seat
,
and
stalking
across
the
room
sat
down
in
a
corner
of
the
chimney
,
which
the
politeness
or
fears
of
the
little
clerk
very
readily
assigned
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
highwayman
!
"
<EOS>
whispered
Tom
Cobb
to
Parkes
the
ranger
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
suppose
highwaymen
do
n't
dress
handsomer
than
that
?
"
replied
Parkes
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
better
business
than
you
think
for
,
Tom
,
and
highwaymen
<EOS>
do
n't
need
or
use
to
be
shabby
,
take
my
word
for
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
the
subject
of
their
speculations
had
done
due
honour
to
the
house
by
calling
for
some
drink
,
which
was
promptly
supplied
by
the
landlord
's
son
Joe
,
a
broad
-
shouldered
strapping
young
fellow
of
twenty
,
whom
it
pleased
his
father
still
to
consider
a
little
boy
,
and
to
treat
accordingly
.
 
<EOS>
Stretching
out
his
hands
to
warm
them
by
the
blazing
fire
,
the
man
turned
his
head
towards
the
company
,
and
after
running
his
eye
sharply
over
them
,
said
in
a
voice
well
suited
to
his
appearance
:
  
"
<EOS>
What
house
is
that
which
stands
a
mile
or
so
from
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Public
-
house
?
"
said
the
landlord
,
with
his
usual
deliberation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Public
-
house
,
father
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Joe
,
"
where
's
the
public
-
house
within
a
mile
or
so
of
the
Maypole
?
 
<EOS>
He
means
the
great
house
---
the
Warren
---
naturally
and
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
red
brick
house
,
sir
,
that
stands
in
its
own
grounds
---
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
"
said
the
stranger
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
that
fifteen
or
twenty
years
ago
stood
in
a
park
five
times
as
broad
,
which
with
other
and
richer
property
has
bit
by
bit
changed
hands
and
dwindled
away
---
<EOS>
more
's
the
pity
!
<EOS>
"
pursued
the
young
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
Maybe
,
"
was
the
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
my
question
related
to
the
owner
.
<EOS>
What
it
has
been
I
do
n't
care
to
know
,
and
<EOS>
what
it
is
I
can
see
for
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
heir
-
apparent
to
the
Maypole
pressed
his
finger
on
his
lips
,
and
glancing
at
the
young
gentleman
already
noticed
,
who
had
changed
his
attitude
when
the
house
was
first
mentioned
,
replied
in
a
lower
tone
:
  
"
<EOS>
The
owner
's
name
is
Haredale
,
Mr
Geoffrey
Haredale
,
and
"
---
again
he
glanced
in
the
same
direction
as
before
---
"
and
a
worthy
gentleman
too
---
hem
!
"
  
<EOS>
Paying
as
little
regard
to
this
admonitory
cough
,
as
to
the
significant
gesture
that
had
preceded
it
,
the
stranger
pursued
his
questioning
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
turned
out
of
my
way
coming
here
,
and
took
the
footpath
that
crosses
the
grounds
.
 
<EOS>
Who
was
the
young
lady
that
I
saw
entering
a
carriage
?
 
<EOS>
His
daughter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
how
should
I
know
,
honest
man
?
"
replied
Joe
,
contriving
in
the
course
of
some
arrangements
about
the
hearth
,
to
advance
close
to
his
questioner
and
pluck
him
by
the
sleeve
,
"
I
did
n't
see
the
young
lady
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
Whew
!
 
<EOS>
There
's
the
wind
again
---
AND
rain
---
 
<EOS>
well
it
IS
a
night
!
"
  
<EOS>
Rough
weather
indeed
!
"
observed
the
strange
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
used
to
it
?
"
said
Joe
,
catching
at
anything
which
seemed
to
promise
a
diversion
of
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pretty
well
,
"
returned
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
About
the
young
lady
---
has
Mr
Haredale
a
daughter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
the
young
fellow
fretfully
,
"
he
's
a
single
gentleman
<EOS>
---
he
's
---
be
quiet
,
ca
n't
you
,
man
?
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
see
this
talk
is
not
relished
yonder
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Regardless
of
this
whispered
remonstrance
,
and
affecting
not
to
hear
it
,
his
tormentor
provokingly
continued
:
  
<EOS>
"
Single
men
have
had
daughters
before
now
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
she
may
be
his
daughter
,
though
he
is
not
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
said
Joe
,
adding
in
an
undertone
as
he
approached
him
again
,
"
You
'll
come
in
for
it
presently
<EOS>
,
I
know
you
will
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
no
harm
"
---
returned
the
traveller
boldly
,
"
and
have
said
none
that
I
know
of
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
a
few
questions
---
as
any
stranger
may
,
and
not
unnaturally
---
about
the
inmates
of
a
remarkable
house
in
a
neighbourhood
which
is
new
to
me
,
and
you
are
as
aghast
and
disturbed
as
if
I
were
talking
treason
against
King
George
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
can
tell
me
<EOS>
why
,
sir
,
for
(
as
I
say
)
I
am
a
stranger
,
and
this
is
Greek
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
latter
observation
was
addressed
to
the
obvious
cause
of
Joe
Willet
's
discomposure
,
who
had
risen
and
was
adjusting
his
riding
-
cloak
preparatory
to
sallying
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
Briefly
replying
that
he
could
give
him
no
information
,
the
young
man
beckoned
to
Joe
,
and
handing
him
a
piece
of
money
in
payment
of
his
reckoning
,
hurried
out
attended
by
young
Willet
himself
,
who
taking
up
a
candle
followed
to
light
him
to
the
house
-
door
.
  
<EOS>
While
Joe
was
absent
on
this
errand
,
the
elder
Willet
and
his
three
companions
continued
to
smoke
with
profound
gravity
,
and
in
a
deep
silence
,
each
having
his
eyes
fixed
on
a
huge
copper
boiler
that
was
suspended
over
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
After
some
time
John
Willet
slowly
shook
his
head
,
and
thereupon
his
friends
slowly
shook
theirs
;
but
no
man
withdrew
his
eyes
from
the
boiler
,
or
altered
the
solemn
expression
of
his
countenance
in
the
slightest
degree
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
Joe
returned
---
very
talkative
and
conciliatory
,
as
though
with
a
strong
presentiment
that
he
was
going
to
be
found
fault
with
.
  
<EOS>
"
Such
a
thing
as
love
is
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
drawing
a
chair
near
the
fire
,
and
looking
round
for
sympathy
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
set
off
to
walk
to
London
,
---
all
the
way
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
His
nag
gone
lame
in
riding
out
here
this
blessed
afternoon
,
and
comfortably
littered
down
in
our
stable
at
this
minute
;
and
he
giving
up
a
good
hot
supper
and
our
best
bed
,
because
Miss
Haredale
has
gone
to
a
masquerade
up
in
town
,
and
he
has
set
his
heart
upon
seeing
her
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
I
could
persuade
myself
to
do
that
,
beautiful
as
she
is
,
---
<EOS>
but
then
I
'm
not
in
love
(
at
least
I
do
n't
think
I
am
)
and
that
's
the
whole
difference
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
in
love
then
?
"
said
the
stranger
.
  
<EOS>
"
Rather
,
"
replied
Joe
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
'll
never
be
more
in
love
,
and
may
very
easily
be
less
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Silence
,
sir
!
"
cried
his
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
chap
you
are
,
Joe
!
"
said
Long
Parkes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Such
a
inconsiderate
lad
!
"
<EOS>
murmured
Tom
Cobb
.
  
<EOS>
"
Putting
himself
forward
and
wringing
the
very
nose
off
his
own
father
's
face
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
parish
-
clerk
,
metaphorically
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
HAVE
I
done
?
"
reasoned
poor
Joe
.
  
<EOS>
"
Silence
,
sir
!
"
returned
his
father
,
"
what
do
you
mean
by
talking
,
when
you
see
people
that
are
more
than
two
or
three
times
your
age
,
sitting
still
and
silent
and
not
dreaming
of
saying
a
word
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
that
's
the
proper
time
for
me
to
talk
,
is
n't
it
?
"
said
Joe
rebelliously
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
proper
time
,
sir
!
"
retorted
his
father
,
"
<EOS>
the
proper
time
's
no
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
to
be
sure
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
Parkes
,
nodding
gravely
to
the
other
two
who
nodded
likewise
,
observing
under
their
breaths
that
that
was
the
point
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
proper
time
's
no
time
,
sir
,
"
repeated
John
Willet
;
"
when
I
was
your
age
I
never
talked
,
I
never
wanted
to
talk
.
 
<EOS>
I
listened
and
improved
myself
that
's
what
I
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
'd
find
your
father
rather
a
tough
customer
in
argeyment
,
Joe
,
if
anybody
was
to
try
and
tackle
him
,
"
said
Parkes
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
the
matter
o
'
<EOS>
that
,
Phil
!
"
observed
Mr
Willet
,
blowing
a
long
,
thin
,
spiral
cloud
of
smoke
out
of
the
corner
of
his
mouth
,
and
staring
at
it
abstractedly
as
it
floated
away
;
"
For
the
matter
o
'
that
,
Phil
,
argeyment
is
a
gift
of
Natur
.
 
<EOS>
If
Natur
has
gifted
a
man
with
powers
of
argeyment
,
a
man
has
a
right
to
make
the
best
of
'em
,
and
has
not
a
right
to
stand
on
false
delicacy
,
and
deny
that
he
is
so
gifted
;
for
that
is
a
turning
of
his
back
on
Natur
,
a
flouting
of
her
,
a
slighting
of
her
precious
caskets
,
and
a
proving
of
one
's
self
to
be
a
swine
that
is
n't
worth
her
scattering
pearls
before
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
landlord
pausing
here
for
a
very
long
time
,
Mr
Parkes
naturally
concluded
that
he
had
brought
his
discourse
to
an
end
;
and
therefore
,
turning
to
the
young
man
with
some
austerity
,
exclaimed
:
  
"
You
hear
what
your
father
says
,
Joe
?
 
<EOS>
You
would
n't
much
like
to
tackle
him
in
argeyment
<EOS>
,
I
'm
thinking
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
IF
,
"
said
John
Willet
,
turning
his
eyes
from
the
ceiling
to
the
face
of
his
interrupter
,
and
uttering
the
monosyllable
in
capitals
,
to
apprise
him
that
he
had
put
in
his
oar
,
as
the
vulgar
say
,
with
unbecoming
and
irreverent
haste
;
"
IF
,
sir
,
Natur
has
fixed
upon
me
the
gift
of
argeyment
,
why
should
I
not
own
to
it
,
and
rather
glory
in
the
same
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
,
I
AM
a
tough
customer
that
way
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
right
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
My
toughness
has
been
proved
,
sir
,
in
this
room
many
and
many
a
time
,
as
I
think
you
know
;
and
if
you
do
n't
know
,
"
added
John
,
putting
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
again
,
"
<EOS>
so
much
the
better
,
for
I
an't
proud
and
am
not
going
to
tell
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
A
general
murmur
from
his
three
cronies
,
and
a
general
shaking
of
heads
at
the
copper
boiler
,
assured
John
Willet
that
they
had
had
good
experience
of
his
powers
and
needed
no
further
evidence
to
assure
them
of
his
superiority
.
 
<EOS>
John
smoked
with
a
little
more
dignity
and
surveyed
them
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
very
fine
talking
,
"
muttered
Joe
,
who
had
been
fidgeting
in
his
chair
with
divers
uneasy
gestures
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
if
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
I
'm
never
to
open
my
lips
---
"
  
"
Silence
,
sir
!
"
roared
his
father
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
you
never
are

<EOS>
When
your
opinion
's
wanted
,
you
give
it

<EOS>
When
you
're
spoke
to

you
speak

<EOS>
When
your
opinion
's
not
wanted
and
you
're
not
spoke
to

do
n't
you
give
an
opinion
and
do
n't
you
speak
.
 
<EOS>
The
world
's
undergone
a
nice
alteration
since
my
time
,
certainly
.
 
<EOS>
My
belief
is
that
there
an't
<EOS>
any
boys
left
---
that
there
is
n't
such
a
thing
as
a
boy
<EOS>
---
that
there
's
nothing
now
between
a
male
baby
and
a
man
---
and
that
all
the
boys
went
out
with
his
blessed
Majesty
King
George
the
Second
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
very
true
observation
,
always
excepting
the
young
princes
,
"
said
the
parish
-
clerk
,
who
,
as
the
representative
of
church
and
state
in
that
company
,
held
himself
bound
to
the
nicest
loyalty
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
it
's
godly
and
righteous
for
boys
,
being
of
the
ages
of
boys
,
to
behave
themselves
like
boys
,
then
the
young
princes
must
be
boys
and
can
not
be
otherwise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
ever
hear
tell
of
mermaids
,
sir
?
"
said
Mr
Willet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
I
have
,
"
replied
the
clerk
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
"
said
Mr
Willet
.
 
<EOS>
"
According
to
the
constitution
of
mermaids
,
so
much
of
a
mermaid
as
is
not
a
woman
must
be
a
fish
.
<EOS>
According
to
the
constitution
of
young
princes
,
so
much
of
a
young
prince
(
if
anything
)
as
is
not
actually
an
angel
,
must
be
godly
and
righteous
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
if
it
's
becoming
and
godly
and
righteous
in
the
young
princes
(
as
it
is
at
their
ages
)
that
they
should
be
boys
,
they
are
and
must
be
boys
,
and
can
not
by
possibility
be
anything
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
elucidation
of
a
knotty
point
being
received
with
such
marks
of
approval
as
to
put
John
Willet
into
a
good
humour
,
he
contented
himself
with
repeating
to
his
son
his
command
of
silence
,
and
addressing
the
stranger
,
said
:
  
"
If

had
asked
your

"
<EOS>
cried
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
dead
in
a
common
sort
of
way
,
"
said
the
landlord
.
  
<EOS>
The
cronies
nodded
to
each
other
,
and
Mr
Parkes
remarked
in
an
undertone
,
shaking
his
head
meanwhile
as
who
should
say
,
"
let
no
man
contradict
me
,
for
I
wo
n't
believe
him
,
"
that
John
Willet
was
in
amazing
force
to
-
night
,
and
fit
to
tackle
a
Chief
Justice
.
  
<EOS>
The
stranger
suffered
a
short
pause
to
elapse
,
and
then
asked
abruptly
,
"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
More
than
you
think
for
,
friend
,
"
returned
John
Willet
.
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
there
's
more
meaning
in
them
words
than
you
suspect
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
there
is
,
"
said
the
strange
man
,
gruffly
;
"
but
what
the
devil
do
you
speak
in
such
mysteries
for
?
 
<EOS>
You
tell
me
,
first
,
that
a
man
is
not
alive
,
nor
yet
dead
---
then
,
that
he
's
not
dead
in
a
common
sort
of
way
---
then
,
that
you
mean
a
great
deal
more
than
I
think
for
.
 
<EOS>
To
tell
you
the
truth
,
you
may
do
that
easily
;
for
so
far
as
I
can
make
out
,
you
mean
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
What
DO
you
mean
,
I
ask
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
,
"
returned
the
landlord
,
a
little
brought
down
from
his
dignity
by
the
stranger
's
surliness
,
"
is
a
Maypole
story
,
and
has
been
any
time
these
four
-
and
-
twenty
years
.
 
<EOS>
That
story
is
Solomon
Daisy
's
story
.
 
<EOS>
It
belongs
to
the
house
;
and
nobody
but
Solomon
Daisy
has
ever
told
it
under
this
roof
,
or
ever
shall
<EOS>
---
that
's
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
man
glanced
at
the
parish
-
clerk
,
whose
air
of
consciousness
and
importance
plainly
betokened
him
to
be
the
person
referred
to
,
and
,
observing
that
he
had
taken
his
pipe
from
his
lips
,
after
a
very
long
whiff
to
keep
it
alight
,
and
was
evidently
about
to
tell
his
story
without
further
solicitation
,
gathered
his
large
coat
about
him
,
and
shrinking
further
back
was
almost
lost
in
the
gloom
of
the
spacious
chimney
-
corner
,
except
when
the
flame
,
struggling
from
under
a
great
faggot
,
whose
weight
almost
crushed
it
for
the
time
,
shot
upward
with
a
strong
and
sudden
glare
,
and
illumining
his
figure
for
a
moment
,
seemed
afterwards
to
cast
it
into
deeper
obscurity
than
before
.
  
<EOS>
By
this
flickering
light
,
which
made
the
old
room
,
with
its
heavy
timbers
and
panelled
walls
,
look
as
if
it
were
built
of
polished
ebony
---
the
wind
roaring
and
howling
without
,
now
rattling
the
latch
and
creaking
the
hinges
of
the
stout
oaken
door
,
and
now
driving
at
the
casement
as
though
it
would
beat
it
in
---
by
this
light
,
and
under
circumstances
so
auspicious
,
Solomon
Daisy
began
his
tale
:
  
"
<EOS>
It
was
Mr
Reuben
Haredale
,
Mr
Geoffrey
's
elder
brother
---
"
  
Here
he
came
to
a
dead
stop
,
and
made
so
long
a
pause
that
even
John
Willet
grew
impatient
and
asked
why
he
did
not
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Cobb
,
"
said
Solomon
Daisy
,
dropping
his
voice
and
appealing
to
the
post
-
office
keeper
;
"
what
day
of
the
month
is
this
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
The
nineteenth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
March
,
"
said
the
clerk
,
bending
forward
,
"
the
nineteenth
of
March
;
that
's
very
strange
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
a
low
voice
they
all
acquiesced
,
and
Solomon
went
on
:
  
"
<EOS>
It
was
Mr
Reuben
Haredale
,
Mr
Geoffrey
's
elder
brother
,
that
twenty
-
two
years
ago
was
the
owner
of
the
Warren
,
which
,
as
Joe
has
said
---
not
that
you
remember
it
,
Joe
,
for
a
boy
like
you
ca
n't
do
that
,
but
because
you
have
often
heard
me
say
so
---
was
then
a
much
larger
and
better
place
,
and
a
much
more
valuable
property
than
it
is
now
.
 
<EOS>
His
lady
was
lately
dead
,
and
he
was
left
with
one
child
---
the
Miss
Haredale
you
have
been
inquiring
about
---
who
was
then
scarcely
a
year
old
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Although
the
speaker
addressed
himself
to
the
man
who
had
shown
so
much
curiosity
about
this
same
family
,
and
made
a
pause
here
as
if
expecting
some
exclamation
of
surprise
or
encouragement
,
the
latter
made
no
remark
,
nor
gave
any
indication
that
he
heard
or
was
interested
in
what
was
said
.
 
<EOS>
Solomon
therefore
turned
to
his
old
companions
,
whose
noses
were
brightly
illuminated
by
the
deep
red
glow
from
the
bowls
of
their
pipes
;
assured
,
by
long
experience
,
of
their
attention
,
and
resolved
to
show
his
sense
of
such
indecent
behaviour
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Haredale
,
"
said
Solomon
,
turning
his
back
upon
the
strange
man
,
"
left
this
place
when
his
lady
died
,
feeling
it
lonely
like
,
and
went
up
to
London
,
where
he
stopped
some
months
;
but
finding
that
place
as
lonely
as
this
---
as
I
suppose
and
have
always
heard
say
---
he
suddenly
came
back
again
with
his
little
girl
to
the
Warren
,
bringing
with
him
besides
,
that
day
,
only
two
women
servants
,
and
his
steward
,
and
a
gardener
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Daisy
stopped
to
take
a
whiff
at
his
pipe
,
which
was
going
out
,
and
then
proceeded
---
at
first
in
a
snuffling
tone
,
occasioned
by
keen
enjoyment
of
the
tobacco
and
strong
pulling
at
the
pipe
,
and
afterwards
with
increasing
distinctness
:
  
"
---
<EOS>
Bringing
with
him
two
women
servants
,
and
his
steward
,
and
a
gardener
.
 
<EOS>
The
rest
stopped
behind
up
in
London
,
and
were
to
follow
next
day
.
 
<EOS>
It
happened
that
that
night
,
an
old
gentleman
who
lived
at
Chigwell
Row
,
and
had
long
been
poorly
,
deceased
,
and
an
order
came
to
me
at
half
after
twelve
o'clock
at
night
to
go
and
toll
the
passing
-
bell
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
movement
in
the
little
group
of
listeners
,
sufficiently
indicative
of
the
strong
repugnance
any
one
of
them
would
have
felt
to
have
turned
out
at
such
a
time
upon
such
an
errand
.
 
<EOS>
The
clerk
felt
and
understood
it
,
and
pursued
his
theme
accordingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
WAS
a
dreary
thing
,
especially
as
the
grave
-
digger
was
laid
up
in
his
bed
,
from
long
working
in
a
damp
soil
and
sitting
down
to
take
his
dinner
on
cold
tombstones
,
and
I
was
consequently
under
obligation
to
go
alone
,
for
it
was
too
late
to
hope
to
get
any
other
companion
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
I
was
n't
unprepared
for
it
;
as
the
old
gentleman
had
often
made
it
a
request
that
the
bell
should
be
tolled
as
soon
as
possible
after
the
breath
was
out
of
his
body
,
and
he
had
been
expected
to
go
for
some
days
.
 
<EOS>
I
put
as
good
a
face
upon
it
as
I
could
,
and
muffling
myself
up
(
for
it
was
mortal
cold
)
,
started
out
with
a
lighted
lantern
in
one
hand
and
the
key
of
the
church
in
the
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
this
point
of
the
narrative
,
the
dress
of
the
strange
man
rustled
as
if
he
had
turned
himself
to
hear
more
distinctly
.
<EOS>
Slightly
pointing
over
his
shoulder
,
Solomon
elevated
his
eyebrows
and
nodded
a
silent
inquiry
to
Joe
whether
this
was
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
Joe
shaded
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
peered
into
the
corner
,
but
could
make
out
nothing
,
and
so
shook
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
just
such
a
night
as
this
;
blowing
a
hurricane
,
raining
heavily
,
and
very
dark
---
I
often
think
now
,
darker
than
I
ever
saw
it
before
or
since
;
that
may
be
my
fancy
,
but
the
houses
were
all
close
shut
and
the
folks
in
doors
,
and
perhaps
there
is
only
one
other
man
who
knows
how
dark
it
really
was
.
 
<EOS>
I
got
into
the
church
,
chained
the
door
back
so
that
it
should
keep
ajar
---
for
,
to
tell
the
truth
<EOS>
,
I
did
n't
like
to
be
shut
in
there
alone
---
and
putting
my
lantern
on
the
stone
seat
in
the
little
corner
where
the
bell
-
rope
is
,
sat
down
beside
it
to
trim
the
candle
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
sat
down
to
trim
the
candle
,
and
when
I
had
done
<EOS>
so
I
could
not
persuade
myself
to
get
up
again
,
and
go
about
my
work
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
it
was
,
but
<EOS>
I
thought
of
all
the
ghost
stories
I
had
ever
heard
,
even
those
that
I
had
heard
when
I
was
a
boy
at
school
,
and
had
forgotten
long
ago
;
and
they
did
n't
come
into
my
mind
one
after
another
,
but
all
crowding
at
once
,
like
.
 
<EOS>
I
recollected
one
story
there
was
in
the
village
,
how
that
on
a
certain
night
in
the
year
(
it
might
be
that
very
night
for
anything
I
knew
)
<EOS>
,
all
the
dead
people
came
out
of
the
ground
and
sat
at
the
heads
of
their
own
graves
till
morning
.
 
<EOS>
This
made
me
think
how
many
people
I
had
known
,
were
buried
between
the
church
-
door
and
the
churchyard
gate
,
and
what
a
dreadful
thing
it
would
be
to
have
to
pass
among
them
and
know
them
again
,
so
earthy
and
unlike
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
known
all
the
niches
and
arches
in
the
church
from
a
child
;
still
,
I
could
n't
persuade
myself
that
those
were
their
natural
shadows
which
I
saw
on
the
pavement
,
but
felt
sure
there
were
some
ugly
figures
hiding
among
'em
and
peeping
out
.
 
<EOS>
Thinking
on
in
this
way
,
I
began
to
think
of
the
old
gentleman
who
was
just
dead
,
and
I
could
have
sworn
,
as
I
looked
up
the
dark
chancel
,
that
I
saw
him
in
his
usual
place
,
wrapping
his
shroud
about
him
and
shivering
as
if
he
felt
it
cold
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
time
I
sat
listening
and
listening
,
and
hardly
dared
to
breathe
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
I
started
up
and
took
the
bell
-
rope
in
my
hands
.
 
<EOS>
At
that
minute
there
rang
---
not
that
bell
,
<EOS>
for
I
had
hardly
touched
the
rope
---
but
another
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
heard
the
ringing
of
another
bell
,
and
a
deep
bell
too
,
plainly
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
for
an
instant
,
and
even
then
the
wind
carried
the
sound
away
,
but
I
heard
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
listened
for
a
long
time
,
but
it
rang
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
heard
of
corpse
candles
,
and
at
last
I
persuaded
myself
that
this
must
be
a
corpse
bell
tolling
of
itself
at
midnight
for
the
dead
.
 
<EOS>
I
tolled
my
bell
---
<EOS>
how
,
or
how
long
,
I
do
n't
know
---
and
ran
home
to
bed
as
fast
as
I
could
touch
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
up
early
next
morning
after
a
restless
night
,
and
told
the
story
to
my
neighbours
.
 
<EOS>
Some
were
serious
and
some
made
light
of
it
;
I
do
n't
think
anybody
believed
it
real
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
that
morning
,
Mr
Reuben
Haredale
was
found
murdered
in
his
bedchamber
;
and
in
his
hand
was
a
piece
of
the
cord
attached
to
an
alarm
-
bell
outside
the
roof
,
which
hung
in
his
room
and
had
been
cut
asunder
,
no
doubt
by
the
murderer
,
when
he
seized
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
was
the
bell
I
heard
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
bureau
was
found
opened
,
and
a
cash
-
box
,
which
Mr
Haredale
had
brought
down
that
day
,
and
was
supposed
to
contain
a
large
sum
of
money
,
was
gone
.
 
<EOS>
The
steward
and
gardener
were
both
missing
and
both
suspected
for
a
long
time
,
but
they
were
never
found
,
though
hunted
far
and
wide
.
 
<EOS>
And
far
enough
they
might
have
looked
for
poor
Mr
Rudge
the
steward
,
whose
body
---
scarcely
to
be
recognised
by
his
clothes
and
the
watch
and
ring
he
wore
---
was
found
,
months
afterwards
,
at
the
bottom
of
a
piece
of
water
in
the
grounds
,
with
a
deep
gash
in
the
breast
where
he
had
been
stabbed
with
a
knife
.
<EOS>
He
was
only
partly
dressed
;
and
people
all
agreed
that
he
had
been
sitting
up
reading
in
his
own
room
,
where
there
were
many
traces
of
blood
,
and
was
suddenly
fallen
upon
and
killed
before
his
master
.
  
<EOS>
Everybody
now
knew
that
the
gardener
must
be
the
murderer
,
and
though
he
has
never
been
heard
of
from
that
day
to
this
,
he
will
be
,
mark
my
words
.
 
<EOS>
The
crime
was
committed
this
day
two
-
and
-
twenty
years
---
on
the
nineteenth
of
March
,
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
fifty
-
three
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
nineteenth
of
March
in
some
year
---
no
matter
when
---
I
know
it
,
I
am
sure
of
it
,
for
we
have
always
,
in
some
strange
way
or
other
,
been
brought
back
to
the
subject
on
that
day
ever
since

in
some
year

sooner

later
,
that
man
will
be
discovered

"
A
strange
story

said
the
man
who
had
been
the
cause
of
the
narration

<EOS>
"
Stranger
still
if
it
comes
about
as

Is
that
all
?
"
  
<EOS>
A
question
so
unexpected
,
nettled
Solomon
Daisy
not
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
By
dint
of
relating
the
story
very
often
,
and
ornamenting
it
(
according
to
village
report
)
with
a
few
flourishes
suggested
by
the
various
hearers
from
time
to
time
,
he
had
come
by
degrees
to
tell
it
with
great
effect
;
and
"
Is
that
all
?
"
<EOS>
after
the
climax
,
was
not
what
he
was
accustomed
to
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
all
?
"
<EOS>
he
repeated
,
"
yes

that
's
all

sir

<EOS>
And
enough
too
<EOS>
,
I
think
.

"

I
think
so
too

My
horse
,
young
man
!
 
<EOS>
He
is
but
a
hack
hired
from
a
roadside
posting
house
,
but
he
must
carry
me
to
London
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
-
night
!
"
said
Joe
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
-
night
,
"
returned
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
stare
at
?
 
<EOS>
This
tavern
would
seem
to
be
a
house
of
call
for
all
the
gaping
idlers
of
the
neighbourhood
!
"
  
<EOS>
At
this
remark
,
which
evidently
had
reference
to
the
scrutiny
he
had
undergone
,
as
mentioned
in
the
foregoing
chapter
,
the
eyes
of
John
Willet
and
his
friends
were
diverted
with
marvellous
rapidity
to
the
copper
boiler
again
.
 
<EOS>
Not
so
with
Joe
,
who
,
being
a
mettlesome
fellow
,
returned
the
stranger
's
angry
glance
with
a
steady
look
,
and
rejoined
:
  
"
It
is
not
a
very
bold
thing
to
wonder
at
your
going
on
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
Surely
you
have
been
asked
such
a
harmless
question
in
an
inn
before
,
and
in
better
weather
than
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
you
might
n't
know
the
way
,
as
you
seem
strange
to
this
part
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
way
---
"
repeated
the
other
,
irritably
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
DO
<EOS>
you
know
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
---
humph
!
<EOS>
---
I
'll
find
it
,
"
replied
the
nian
,
waving
his
hand
and
turning
on
his
heel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Landlord
,
take
the
reckoning
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
John
Willet
did
as
he
was
desired
;
for
on
that
point
he
was
seldom
slow
,
except
in
the
particulars
of
giving
change
,
and
testing
the
goodness
of
any
piece
of
coin
that
was
proffered
to
him
,
by
the
application
of
his
teeth
or
his
tongue
,
or
some
other
test
,
or
in
doubtful
cases
,
by
a
long
series
of
tests
terminating
in
its
rejection
.
 
<EOS>
The
guest
then
wrapped
his
garments
about
him
so
as
to
shelter
himself
as
effectually
as
he
could
from
the
rough
weather
,
and
without
any
word
or
sign
of
farewell
betook
himself
to
the
stableyard
.
 
<EOS>
Here
Joe
(
who
had
left
the
room
on
the
conclusion
of
their
short
dialogue
)
was
protecting
himself
and
the
horse
from
the
rain
under
the
shelter
of
an
old
penthouse
roof
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
pretty
much
of
my
opinion
,
"
said
Joe
,
patting
the
horse
upon
the
neck
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
wager
that
your
stopping
here
to
-
night
would
please
him
better
than
it
would
please
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
and
I
are
of
different
opinions
,
as
we
have
been
more
than
once
on
our
way
here
,
"
was
the
short
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
was
thinking
before
you
came
out
,
for
he
has
felt
your
spurs
,
poor
beast
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
stranger
adjusted
his
coat
-
collar
about
his
face
,
and
made
no
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
know
me
again
,
I
see
,
"
he
said
,
marking
the
young
fellow
's
earnest
gaze
,
when
he
had
sprung
into
the
saddle
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
man
's
worth
knowing
,
master
,
who
travels
a
road
he
do
n't
know
,
mounted
on
a
jaded
horse
,
and
leaves
good
quarters
to
do
it
on
such
a
night
as
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
sharp
eyes
and
a
sharp
tongue
,
I
find
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Both
I
hope
by
nature
,
but
the
last
grows
rusty
sometimes
for
want
of
using
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Use
the
first
less
too
,
and
keep
their
sharpness
for
your
sweethearts
,
boy
,
"
said
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
So
saying
he
shook
his
hand
from
the
bridle
,
struck
him
roughly
on
the
head
with
the
butt
end
of
his
whip
,
and
galloped
away
;
dashing
through
the
mud
and
darkness
with
a
headlong
speed
,
which
few
badly
mounted
horsemen
would
have
cared
to
venture
,
even
had
they
been
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
country
;
and
which
,
to
one
who
knew
nothing
of
the
way
he
rode
,
was
attended
at
every
step
with
great
hazard
and
danger
.
  
<EOS>
The
roads
,
even
within
twelve
miles
of
London
,
were
at
that
time
ill
paved
,
seldom
repaired
,
and
very
badly
made
.
 
<EOS>
The
way
this
rider
traversed
had
been
ploughed
up
by
the
wheels
of
heavy
waggons
,
and
rendered
rotten
by
the
frosts
and
thaws
of
the
preceding
winter
,
or
possibly
of
many
winters
.
 
<EOS>
Great
holes
and
gaps
had
been
worn
into
the
soil
,
which
,
being
now
filled
with
water
from
the
late
rains
,
were
not
easily
distinguishable
even
by
day
;
and
a
plunge
into
any
one
of
them
might
have
brought
down
a
surer
-
footed
horse
than
the
poor
beast
now
urged
forward
to
the
utmost
extent
of
his
powers
.
 
<EOS>
Sharp
flints
and
stones
rolled
from
under
his
hoofs
continually
;
the
rider
could
scarcely
see
beyond
the
animal
's
head
,
or
farther
on
either
side
than
his
own
arm
would
have
extended
.
 
<EOS>
At
that
time
,
too
,
all
the
roads
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
metropolis
were
infested
by
footpads
or
highwaymen
,
and
it
was
a
night
,
of
all
others
,
in
which
any
evil
-
disposed
person
of
this
class
might
have
pursued
his
unlawful
calling
with
little
fear
of
detection
.
  
<EOS>
Still
,
the
traveller
dashed
forward
at
the
same
reckless
pace
,
regardless
alike
of
the
dirt
and
wet
which
flew
about
his
head
,
the
profound
darkness
of
the
night
,
and
the
probability
of
encountering
some
desperate
characters
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
At
every
turn
and
angle
,
even
where
a
deviation
from
the
direct
course
might
have
been
least
expected
,
and
could
not
possibly
be
seen
until
he
was
close
upon
it
<EOS>
,
he
guided
the
bridle
with
an
unerring
hand
,
and
kept
the
middle
of
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
he
sped
onward
,
raising
himself
in
the
stirrups
,
leaning
his
body
forward
until
it
almost
touched
the
horse
's
neck
,
and
flourishing
his
heavy
whip
above
his
head
with
the
fervour
of
a
madman
.
  
<EOS>
There
are
times
when
,
the
elements
being
in
unusual
commotion
,
those
who
are
bent
on
daring
enterprises
,
or
agitated
by
great
thoughts
,
whether
of
good
or
evil
,
feel
a
mysterious
sympathy
with
the
tumult
of
nature
,
and
are
roused
into
corresponding
violence
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
thunder
,
lightning
,
and
storm
,
many
tremendous
deeds
have
been
committed
;
men
,
self
-
possessed
before
,
have
given
a
sudden
loose
to
passions
they
could
no
longer
control
.
 
<EOS>
The
demons
of
wrath
and
despair
have
striven
to
emulate
those
who
ride
the
whirlwind
and
direct
the
storm
;
and
man
,
lashed
into
madness
with
the
roaring
winds
and
boiling
waters
,
has
become
for
the
time
as
wild
and
merciless
as
the
elements
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
Whether
the
traveller
was
possessed
by
thoughts
which
the
fury
of
the
night
had
heated
and
stimulated
into
a
quicker
current
,
or
was
merely
impelled
by
some
strong
motive
to
reach
his
journey
's
end
,
on
he
swept
more
like
a
hunted
phantom
than
a
man
,
nor
checked
his
pace
until
,
arriving
at
some
cross
roads
,
one
of
which
led
by
a
longer
route
to
the
place
<EOS>
whence
he
had
lately
started
,
he
bore
down
so
suddenly
upon
a
vehicle
which
was
coming
towards
him
,
that
in
the
effort
to
avoid
it
<EOS>
he
well
-
nigh
pulled
his
horse
upon
his
haunches
,
and
narrowly
escaped
being
thrown
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yoho
!
"
cried
the
voice
of
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
?
 
<EOS>
Who
goes
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
friend
!
"
replied
the
traveller
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
friend
!
"
repeated
the
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
calls
himself
a
friend
and
rides
like
that
,
abusing
Heaven
's
gifts
in
the
shape
of
horseflesh
,
and
endangering
,
not
only
his
own
neck
(
which
might
be
no
great
matter
)
<EOS>
but
the
necks
of
other
people
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
lantern
there
,
I
see
,
"
said
the
traveller
dismounting
,
"
lend
it
me
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
wounded
my
horse
,
I
think
,
with
your
shaft
or
wheel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wounded
him
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
other
,
"
<EOS>
if
I
have
n't
killed
him
,
it
's
no
fault
of
yours
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
by
galloping
along
the
king
's
highway
like
that
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Give
me
the
light
,
"
returned
the
traveller
,
snatching
it
from
his
hand
,
"
and
do
n't
ask
idle
questions
of
a
man
who
is
in
no
mood
for
talking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
had
said
you
were
in
no
mood
for
talking
before
,
I
should
perhaps
have
been
in
no
mood
for
lighting
,
"
said
the
voice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hows'ever
<EOS>
as
it
's
the
poor
horse
that
's
damaged
and
not
you
,
one
of
you
is
welcome
to
the
light
at
all
events
---
but
it
's
not
the
crusty
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
traveller
returned
no
answer
to
this
speech
,
but
holding
the
light
near
to
his
panting
and
reeking
beast
,
examined
him
in
limb
and
carcass
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
other
man
sat
very
composedly
in
his
vehicle
,
which
was
a
kind
of
chaise
with
a
depository
for
a
large
bag
of
tools
,
and
watched
his
proceedings
with
a
careful
eye
.
  
<EOS>
The
looker
-
on
was
a
round
,
red
-
faced
,
sturdy
yeoman
,
with
a
double
chin
,
and
a
voice
husky
with
good
living
,
good
sleeping
,
good
humour
,
and
good
health
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
past
the
prime
of
life
,
but
Father
Time
is
not
always
a
hard
parent
,
and
,
though
he
tarries
for
none
of
his
children
,
often
lays
his
hand
lightly
upon
those
who
have
used
him
well
;
making
them
old
men
and
women
inexorably
enough
,
but
leaving
their
hearts
and
spirits
young
and
in
full
vigour
.
 
<EOS>
With
such
people
the
grey
head
is
but
the
impression
of
the
old
fellow
's
hand
in
giving
them
his
blessing
,
and
every
wrinkle
but
a
notch
in
the
quiet
calendar
of
a
well
-
spent
life
.
  
<EOS>
The
person
whom
the
traveller
had
so
abruptly
encountered
was
of
this
kind
:
bluff
,
hale
,
hearty
,
and
in
a
green
old
age
:
at
peace
with
himself
,
and
evidently
disposed
to
be
so
with
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
Although
muffled
up
in
divers
coats
and
handkerchiefs
---
one
of
which
,
passed
over
his
crown
,
and
tied
in
a
convenient
crease
of
his
double
chin
,
secured
his
three
-
cornered
hat
and
bob
-
wig
from
blowing
off
his
head
<EOS>
---
there
was
no
disguising
his
plump
and
comfortable
figure
;
neither
did
certain
dirty
finger
-
marks
upon
his
face
give
it
any
other
than
an
odd
and
comical
expression
,
through
which
its
natural
good
humour
shone
with
undiminished
lustre
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
not
hurt
,
"
said
the
traveller
at
length
,
raising
his
head
and
the
lantern
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
found
that
out
at
last
,
have
you
?
"
rejoined
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
My
eyes
have
seen
more
light
than
yours
,
but
I
would
n't
change
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mean
!
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
told
you
he
was
n't
hurt
,
five
minutes
ago
.
<EOS>
Give
me
the
light
,
friend
;
ride
forward
at
a
gentler
pace
;
and
good
night
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
handing
up
the
lantern
,
the
man
necessarily
cast
its
rays
full
on
the
speaker
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
Their
eyes
met
at
the
instant
.
 
<EOS>
He
suddenly
dropped
it
and
crushed
it
with
his
foot
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
never
see
a
locksmith
before
,
that
you
start
as
if
you
had
come
upon
a
ghost
?
"
cried
the
old
man
in
the
chaise
,
"
or
is
this
,
"
he
added
hastily
,
thrusting
his
hand
into
the
tool
basket
and
drawing
out
a
hammer
,
"
a
scheme
for
robbing
me
?
 
<EOS>
I
know
these
roads
,
friend
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
travel
them
,
I
carry
nothing
but
a
few
shillings
,
and
not
a
crown
's
worth
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
plainly
,
to
save
us
both
trouble
,
that
there
's
nothing
to
be
got
from
me
but
a
pretty
stout
arm
considering
my
years
,
and
this
tool
,
which
,
mayhap
from
long
acquaintance
with
,
I
can
use
pretty
briskly
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
not
have
it
all
your
own
way
<EOS>
,
I
promise
you
,
if
you
play
at
that
game
.
 
<EOS>
With
these
words
he
stood
upon
the
defensive
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
what
you
take
me
for
,
Gabriel
Varden
,
"
replied
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
what
and
who
are
you
?
"
returned
the
locksmith
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
my
name
,
it
seems
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
know
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
gained
the
information
from
any
confidence
of
yours
,
but
from
the
inscription
on
your
cart
which
tells
it
to
all
the
town
,
"
replied
the
traveller
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
better
eyes
for
that
than
you
had
for
your
horse
,
then
,
"
said
Varden
,
descending
nimbly
from
his
chaise
;
"
who
are
you
?
 
<EOS>
Let
me
see
your
face
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
While
the
locksmith
alighted
,
the
traveller
had
regained
his
saddle
,
from
which
he
now
confronted
the
old
man
,
who
,
moving
as
the
horse
moved
in
chafing
under
the
tightened
rein
,
kept
close
beside
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
your
face
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Stand
off
!
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
masquerading
tricks
,
"
said
the
locksmith
,
"
and
tales
at
the
club
to
-
morrow
,
how
Gabriel
Varden
was
frightened
by
a
surly
voice
and
a
dark
night
.
 
<EOS>
Stand
<EOS>
---
let
me

your

"
  
<EOS>
Finding
that
further
resistance
would
only
involve
him
in
a
personal
struggle
with
an
antagonist
by
no
means
to
be
despised
,
the
traveller
threw
back
his
coat
,
and
stooping
down
looked
steadily
at
the
locksmith
.
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
two
men
more
powerfully
contrasted
,
never
opposed
each
other
face
to
face
.
 
<EOS>
The
ruddy
features
of
the
locksmith
so
set
off
and
heightened
the
excessive
paleness
of
the
man
on
horseback
,
that
he
looked
like
a
bloodless
ghost
,
while
the
moisture
,
which
hard
riding
had
brought
out
upon
his
skin
,
hung
there
in
dark
and
heavy
drops
,
like
dews
of
agony
and
death
.
 
<EOS>
The
countenance
of
the
old
locksmith
lighted
up
with
the
smile
of
one
expecting
to
detect
in
this
unpromising
stranger
some
latent
roguery
of
eye
or
lip
,
which
should
reveal
a
familiar
person
in
that
arch
disguise
,
and
spoil
his
jest
.
 
<EOS>
The
face
of
the
other
,
sullen
and
fierce
,
but
shrinking
too
,
was
that
of
a
man
who
stood
at
bay
;
while
his
firmly
closed
jaws
,
his
puckered
mouth
,
and
more
than
all
a
certain
stealthy
motion
of
the
hand
within
his
breast
,
seemed
to
announce
a
desperate
purpose
very
foreign
to
acting
,
or
child
's
play
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
they
regarded
each
other
for
some
time
,
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
when
he
had
scanned
his
features
;
"
I
do
n't
know
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
desire
to
?
"
<EOS>
---
returned
the
other
,
muffling
himself
as
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
,
"
said
Gabriel
;
"
to
be
plain
with
you
,
friend
,
you
do
n't
carry
in
your
countenance
a
letter
of
recommendation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
my
wish
,
"
said
the
traveller
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
humour
is
to
be
avoided
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
the
locksmith
bluntly
,
"
I
think
you
'll
have
your
humour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
at
any
cost
,
"
rejoined
the
traveller
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
proof
of
it
,
lay
this
to
heart
---
that
you
were
never
in
such
peril
of
your
life
as
you
have
been
within
these
few
moments
;
when
you
are
within
five
minutes
of
breathing
your
last
,
you
will
not
be
nearer
death
than
you
have
been
to
-
night
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
!
"
said
the
sturdy
locksmith
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
!
<EOS>
and
a
violent
death
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
From
whose
hand
?
"
  
"
From
mine
,
"
replied
the
traveller
.
  
<EOS>
With
that
he
put
spurs
to
his
horse
,
and
rode
away
;
at
first
plashing
heavily
through
the
mire
at
a
smart
trot
,
but
gradually
increasing
in
speed
until
the
last
sound
of
his
horse
's
hoofs
died
away
upon
the
wind
;
when
he
was
again
hurrying
on
at
the
same
furious
gallop
,
which
had
been
his
pace
when
the
locksmith
first
encountered
him
.
  
<EOS>
Gabriel
Varden
remained
standing
in
the
road
with
the
broken
lantern
in
his
hand
,
listening
in
stupefied
silence
until
no
sound
reached
his
ear
but
<EOS>
the
moaning
of
the
wind
,
and
the
fast
-
falling
rain
;
when
he
struck
himself
one
or
two
smart
blows
in
the
breast
by
way
of
rousing
himself
,
and
broke
into
an
exclamation
of
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
in
the
name
of
wonder
can
this
fellow
be
!
<EOS>
a
madman
?
<EOS>
a
highwayman
?
<EOS>
a
cut
-
throat
?
 
<EOS>
If
he
had
not
scoured
off
so
fast
,
we
'd
have
seen
who
was
in
most
danger
,
he
or
I.
 
I
never
nearer
death
than
I
have
been
to
-
night
!
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
may
be
no
nearer
to
it
for
a
score
of
years
to
come
---
<EOS>
if
so
,
I
'll
be
content
to
be
no
farther
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
My
stars
!
<EOS>
---
a
pretty
brag
this
to
a
stout
man
---
pooh
,
pooh
!
"
  
<EOS>
Gabriel
resumed
his
seat
,
and
looked
wistfully
up
the
road
by
which
the
traveller
had
come
;
murmuring
in
a
half
whisper
:
  
"
The
Maypole
---
two
miles
to
the
Maypole
.
 
<EOS>
I
came
the
other
road
from
the
Warren
after
a
long
day
's
work
at
locks
and
bells
,
on
purpose
that
I
should
not
come
by
the
Maypole
and
break
my
promise
to
Martha
by
looking
in
<EOS>
---
there
's
resolution
!
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
dangerous
to
go
on
to
London
without
a
light
;
and
it
's
four
miles
,
and
a
good
half
mile
besides
,
to
the
Halfway
-
House
;
and
between
this
<EOS>
and
that
is
the
very
place
where
one
needs
a
light
most
.
 
<EOS>
Two
miles
to
the
Maypole
!
 
<EOS>
I
told
Martha
I
would
n't
;
I
said
I
would
n't
,
and
I
did
n't
<EOS>
---
there
's
resolution
!
"
  
<EOS>
Repeating
these
two
last
words
very
often
,
as
if
to
compensate
for
the
little
resolution
he
was
going
to
show
by
piquing
himself
on
the
great
resolution
he
had
shown
,
Gabriel
Varden
quietly
turned
back
,
determining
to
get
a
light
at
the
Maypole
,
and
to
take
nothing
but
a
light
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
got
to
the
Maypole
,
however
,
and
Joe
,
responding
to
his
well
-
known
hail
,
came
running
out
to
the
horse
's
head
,
leaving
the
door
open
behind
him
,
and
disclosing
a
delicious
perspective
of
warmth
and
brightness
---
when
the
ruddy
gleam
of
the
fire
,
streaming
through
the
old
red
curtains
of
the
common
room
,
seemed
to
bring
with
it
,
as
part
of
itself
,
a
pleasant
hum
of
voices
,
and
a
fragrant
odour
of
steaming
grog
and
rare
tobacco
,
all
steeped
as
it
were
in
the
cheerful
glow
---
when
the
shadows
,
flitting
across
the
curtain
,
showed
that
those
inside
had
risen
from
their
snug
seats
,
and
were
making
room
in
the
snuggest
corner
(
how
well
he
knew
that
corner
!
)
<EOS>
for
the
honest
locksmith
,
and
a
broad
glare
,
suddenly
streaming
up
,
bespoke
the
goodness
of
the
crackling
log
from
which
a
brilliant
train
of
sparks
was
doubtless
at
that
moment
whirling
up
the
chimney
in
honour
of
his
coming
---
when
,
superadded
to
these
enticements
,
there
stole
upon
him
from
the
distant
kitchen
a
gentle
sound
of
frying
,
with
a
musical
clatter
of
plates
and
dishes
,
and
a
savoury
smell
that
made
even
the
boisterous
wind
<EOS>
a
perfume
<EOS>
---
Gabriel
felt
his
firmness
oozing
rapidly
away
.
 
<EOS>
He
tried
to
look
stoically
at
the
tavern
,
but
his
features
would
relax
into
a
look
of
fondness
.
 
<EOS>
He
turned
his
head
the
other
way
,
and
the
cold
black
country
seemed
to
frown
him
off
,
and
drive
him
for
a
refuge
into
its
hospitable
arms
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
merciful
man
,
Joe
,
"
said
the
locksmith
,
"
is
merciful
to
his
beast
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
get
out
for
a
little
while
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
how
natural
it
was
to
get
out
!
 
<EOS>
And
how
unnatural
it
seemed
for
a
sober
man
to
be
plodding
wearily
along
through
miry
roads
,
encountering
the
rude
buffets
of
the
wind
and
pelting
of
the
rain
,
when
there
was
a
clean
floor
covered
with
crisp
white
sand
,
a
well
swept
hearth
,
a
blazing
fire
,
a
table
decorated
with
white
cloth
,
bright
pewter
flagons
,
and
other
tempting
preparations
for
a
well
-
cooked
meal
---
when
there
were
these
things
,
and
company
disposed
to
make
the
most
of
them
,
all
ready
to
his
hand
,
and
entreating
him
to
enjoyment
!
    
<EOS>
Chapter
03
    
<EOS>
Such
were
the
locksmith
's
thoughts
when
first
seated
in
the
snug
corner
,
and
slowly
recovering
from
a
pleasant
defect
of
vision
---
 
<EOS>
pleasant
,
because
occasioned
by
the
wind
blowing
in
his
eyes
---
which
made
it
a
matter
of
sound
policy
and
duty
to
himself
,
that
he
should
take
refuge
from
the
weather
,
and
tempted
him
,
for
the
same
reason
,
to
aggravate
a
slight
cough
,
and
declare
he
felt
but
poorly
.
 
<EOS>
Such
were
still
his
thoughts
more
than
a
full
hour
afterwards
,
when
,
supper
over
,
he
still
sat
with
shining
jovial
face
in
the
same
warm
nook
,
listening
to
the
cricket
-
like
chirrup
of
little
Solomon
Daisy
,
and
bearing
no
unimportant
or
slightly
respected
part
in
the
social
gossip
round
the
Maypole
fire
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
he
may
be
an
honest
man
,
that
's
all
,
"
said
Solomon
,
winding
up
a
variety
of
speculations
relative
to
the
stranger
,
concerning
whom
Gabriel
had
compared
notes
with
the
company
,
and
so
raised
a
grave
discussion
;
"
I
wish
he
may
be
an
honest
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
we
all
do
,
I
suppose
,
do
n't
we
?
"
observed
the
locksmith
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
,
"
said
Joe
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
cried
Gabriel
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
He
struck
me
with
his
whip
,
the
coward
,
when
he
was
mounted
and
I
afoot
,
and
I
should
be
better
pleased
that
he
turned
out
what
I
think
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
may
that
be
,
Joe
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
good
,
Mr
Varden
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
shake
your
head
,
father
,
but
I
say
no
good
,
and
will
say
no
good
,
and
<EOS>
I
would
say
no
good
a
hundred
times
over
,
if
that
would
bring
him
back
to
have
the
drubbing
he
deserves
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hold
your
tongue
,
sir
,
"
said
John
Willet
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
,
father
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
all
along
of
you
that
he
ventured
to
do
what
he
did
.
 
<EOS>
Seeing
me
treated
like
a
child
,
and
put
down
like
a
fool
,
HE
plucks
up
a
heart
and
has
a
fling
at
a
fellow
that
he
thinks
---
and
may
well
think
too
---
has
n't
a
grain
of
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
's
mistaken
,
as
I
'll
show
him
,
and
as
I
'll
show
all
of
you
before
long

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Does
the
boy
know
what
he
's
a
saying
of
!
"
cried
the
astonished
John
Willet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Father
,
"
returned
Joe
,
"
I
know
what
I
say
and
mean
,
<EOS>
well
---
better
than
you
do
when
you
hear
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
bear
with
you
,
but
I
can
not
bear
the
contempt
that
your
treating
me
in
the
way
you
do
,
brings
upon
me
from
others
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
Look
at
other
young
men
of
my
age
.
<EOS>
Have
they
no
liberty
,
no
will
,
no
right
to
speak
?
 
<EOS>
Are
they
obliged
to
sit
mumchance
,
and
to
be
ordered
about
till
they
are
the
laughing
-
stock
of
young
and
old
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
a
bye
-
word
all
over
Chigwell
,
and
I
say
---
<EOS>
and
it
's
fairer
my
saying
<EOS>
so
now
,
than
waiting
till
you
are
dead
,
<EOS>
and
I
have
got
your
money
---
I
say
,
that
before
long
I
shall
be
driven
to
break
such
bounds
,
and
that
when
I
do
,
it
wo
n't
be
me
that
you
'll
have
to
blame
,
but
your
own
self
,
and
no
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
John
Willet
was
so
amazed
by
the
exasperation
and
boldness
of
his
hopeful
son
,
that
he
sat
as
one
bewildered
,
staring
in
a
ludicrous
manner
at
the
boiler
,
and
endeavouring
,
but
quite
ineffectually
,
to
collect
his
tardy
thoughts
,
and
invent
an
answer
.
 
<EOS>
The
guests
,
scarcely
less
disturbed
,
were
equally
at
a
loss
;
and
at
length
,
with
a
variety
of
muttered
,
half
-
expressed
condolences
,
and
pieces
of
advice
,
rose
to
depart
;
being
at
the
same
time
slightly
muddled
with
liquor
.
  
<EOS>
The
honest
locksmith
alone
addressed
a
few
words
of
coherent
and
sensible
advice
to
both
parties
,
urging
John
Willet
to
remember
that
Joe
was
nearly
arrived
at
man
's
estate
,
and
should
not
be
ruled
with
too
tight
a
hand
,
and
exhorting
Joe
himself
to
bear
with
his
father
's
caprices
,
and
rather
endeavour
to
turn
them
aside
by
temperate
remonstrance
than
by
ill
-
timed
rebellion
.
 
<EOS>
This
advice
was
received
as
such
advice
usually
is
.
 
<EOS>
On
John
Willet
it
made
almost
as
much
impression
as
on
the
sign
outside
the
door
,
while
Joe
,
who
took
it
in
the
best
part
,
avowed
himself
more
obliged
than
he
could
well
express
,
but
politely
intimated
his
intention
nevertheless
of
taking
his
own
course
uninfluenced
by
anybody
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
always
been
a
very
good
friend
to
me
,
Mr
Varden
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
,
as
they
stood
without
,
in
the
porch
,
and
the
locksmith
was
equipping
himself
for
his
journey
home
;
"
I
take
it
very
kind
of
you
to
say
all
this
,
but
the
time
's
nearly
come
when
the
Maypole
and
I
must
part
company
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Roving
stones
gather
no
moss

Joe
,
"
said
Gabriel
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
milestones
much

"
replied
Joe
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
little
better
than
one
here
,
and
see
as
much
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
what
would
you
do
,
Joe
?
<EOS>
"
pursued
the
locksmith
,
stroking
his
chin
reflectively
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
could
you
be
?
 
<EOS>
Where
could
you
go
,
you
see
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
trust
to
chance
,
Mr
Varden
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
A
bad
thing
to
trust
to
,
Joe
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
always
tell
my
girl
when
we
talk
about
a
husband
for
her
,
never
to
trust
to
chance
,
but
to
make
sure
beforehand
that
she
has
a
good
man
and
true
,
and
then
chance
will
neither
make
her
nor
break
her
.
 
<EOS>
What
are
you
fidgeting
about
there
,
Joe
?
 
<EOS>
Nothing
gone
in
the
harness
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
no
,
"
said
Joe
---
finding
,
however
,
something
very
engrossing
to
do
in
the
way
of
strapping
and
buckling
---
"
Miss
Dolly
quite
well
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hearty
,
thankye
.
 
<EOS>
She
looks
pretty
enough
to
be
well
,
and
good
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
always
both
,
sir
"
---
   
<EOS>
"
So
she
is
,
thank
God
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
"
said
Joe
after
some
hesitation
,
"
that
you
wo
n't
tell
this
story
against
me
---
this
of
my
having
been
beat
like
the
boy
they
'd
make
of
me
---
at
all
events
,
till
I
have
met
this
man
again
and
settled
the
account
.
 
<EOS>
It
'll
be
a
better
story
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
who
should
I
tell
it
to
?
"
returned
Gabriel
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
know
it
here
,
and
I
'm
not
likely
to
come
across
anybody
else
who
would
care
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
true
enough
,
"
said
the
young
fellow
with
a
sigh
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
quite
forgot
that
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
that
's
true
!
"
  
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
raised
his
face
,
which
was
very
red
,
---
no
doubt
from
the
exertion
of
strapping
and
buckling
as
aforesaid
,
---
and
giving
the
reins
to
the
old
man
,
who
had
by
this
time
taken
his
seat
,
sighed
again
and
bade
him
good
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
night
!
"
cried
Gabriel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
think
better
of
what
we
have
just
been
speaking
of
;
and
do
n't
be
rash
,
there
's
a
good
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
an
interest
in
you
,
and
would
n't
have
you
cast
yourself
away
.
<EOS>
Good
night
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Returning
his
cheery
farewell
with
cordial
goodwill
,
Joe
Willet
lingered
until
the
sound
of
wheels
ceased
to
vibrate
in
his
ears
,
and
then
,
shaking
his
head
mournfully
,
re
-
entered
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Gabriel
Varden
went
his
way
towards
London
,
thinking
of
a
great
many
things
,
and
most
of
all
of
flaming
terms
in
which
to
relate
his
adventure
,
and
so
account
satisfactorily
to
Mrs
Varden
for
visiting
the
Maypole
,
despite
certain
solemn
covenants
between
himself
and
that
lady
.
 
<EOS>
Thinking
begets
,
not
only
thought
,
but
drowsiness
occasionally
,
and
the
more
the
locksmith
thought
,
the
more
sleepy
he
became
.
  
<EOS>
A
man
may
be
very
sober
---
or
at
least
firmly
set
upon
his
legs
on
that
neutral
ground
which
lies
between
the
confines
of
perfect
sobriety
and
slight
tipsiness
---
and
yet
feel
a
strong
tendency
to
mingle
up
present
circumstances
with
others
which
have
no
manner
of
connection
with
them
;
to
confound
all
consideration
of
persons
,
things
,
times
,
and
places
;
and
to
jumble
his
disjointed
thoughts
together
in
a
kind
of
mental
kaleidoscope
,
producing
combinations
as
unexpected
as
they
are
transitory
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
Gabriel
Varden
's
state
,
as
,
nodding
in
his
dog
sleep
,
and
leaving
his
horse
to
pursue
a
road
with
which
he
was
well
acquainted
,
he
got
over
the
ground
unconsciously
,
and
drew
nearer
and
nearer
home
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
roused
himself
once
,
when
the
horse
stopped
until
the
turnpike
gate
was
opened
,
and
had
cried
a
lusty
"
good
night
!
"
<EOS>
to
the
toll
-
keeper
;
but
then
he
awoke
out
of
a
dream
about
picking
a
lock
in
the
stomach
of
the
Great
Mogul
,
and
even
when
he
did
wake
,
mixed
up
the
turnpike
man
with
his
mother
-
in
-
law
who
had
been
dead
twenty
years
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
surprising
,
therefore
,
that
he
soon
relapsed
,
and
jogged
heavily
along
,
quite
insensible
to
his
progress
.
  
<EOS>
And
,
now
,
he
approached
the
great
city
,
which
lay
outstretched
before
him
like
a
dark
shadow
on
the
ground
,
reddening
the
sluggish
air
with
a
deep
dull
light
,
<EOS>
that
told
of
labyrinths
of
public
ways
and
shops
,
and
swarms
of
busy
people
.
 
<EOS>
Approaching
nearer
and
nearer
yet
,
this
halo
began
to
fade
,
and
the
causes
which
produced
it
slowly
to
develop
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
Long
lines
of
poorly
lighted
streets
might
be
faintly
traced
,
with
here
and
there
a
lighter
spot
,
where
lamps
were
clustered
round
a
square
or
market
,
or
round
some
great
building
;
after
a
time
these
grew
more
distinct
,
and
the
lamps
themselves
were
visible
;
slight
yellow
specks
,
that
seemed
to
be
rapidly
snuffed
out
,
one
by
one
,
as
intervening
obstacles
hid
them
from
the
sight
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
sounds
arose
---
the
striking
of
church
clocks
,
the
distant
bark
of
dogs
,
the
hum
of
traffic
in
the
streets
;
then
outlines
might
be
traced
---
tall
steeples
looming
in
the
air
,
and
piles
of
unequal
roofs
oppressed
by
chimneys
;
then
,
the
noise
swelled
into
a
louder
sound
,
and
forms
grew
more
distinct
and
numerous
still
,
and
London
---
visible
in
the
darkness
by
its
own
faint
light
,
and
not
by
that
of
Heaven
---
was
at
hand
.
  
<EOS>
The
locksmith
,
however
,
all
unconscious
of
its
near
vicinity
,
still
jogged
on
,
half
sleeping
and
half
waking
,
when
a
loud
cry
at
no
great
distance
ahead
,
roused
him
with
a
start
.
  
<EOS>
For
a
moment
or
two
he
looked
about
him
like
a
man
who
had
been
transported
to
some
strange
country
in
his
sleep
,
but
soon
recognising
familiar
objects
,
rubbed
his
eyes
lazily
and
might
have
relapsed
again
,
but
that
the
cry
was
repeated
---
not
once
or
twice
or
thrice
,
but
many
times
,
and
each
time
,
if
possible
,
with
increased
vehemence
.
 
<EOS>
Thoroughly
aroused
,
Gabriel
,
who
was
a
bold
man
and
not
easily
daunted
,
made
straight
to
the
spot
,
urging
on
his
stout
little
horse
as
if
for
life
or
death
.
  
<EOS>
The
matter
indeed
looked
sufficiently
serious
,
for
,
coming
to
the
place
<EOS>
whence
the
cries
had
proceeded
<EOS>
,
he
descried
the
figure
of
a
man
extended
in
an
apparently
lifeless
state
upon
the
pathway
,
and
,
hovering
round
him
,
another
person
with
a
torch
in
his
hand
,
which
he
waved
in
the
air
with
a
wild
impatience
,
redoubling
meanwhile
those
cries
for
help
which
had
brought
the
locksmith
to
the
spot
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
here
to
do
?
"
said
the
old
man
,
alighting
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
's
this
---
 
<EOS>
what
---
Barnaby
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
bearer
of
the
torch
shook
his
long
loose
hair
back
from
his
eyes
,
and
thrusting
his
face
eagerly
into
that
of
the
locksmith
,
fixed
upon
him
a
look
which
told
his
history
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
me
,
Barnaby
?
"
said
Varden
.
  
<EOS>
He
nodded
---
not
once
or
twice
,
but
a
score
of
times
,
and
that
with
a
fantastic
exaggeration
which
would
have
kept
his
head
in
motion
for
an
hour
,
but
that
the
locksmith
held
up
his
finger
,
and
fixing
his
eye
sternly
upon
him
caused
him
to
desist
;
then
pointed
to
the
body
with
an
inquiring
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
blood
upon
him
,
"
said
Barnaby
with
a
shudder
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
makes
me
sick
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
came
it
there
?
"
demanded
Varden
.
  
<EOS>
"
Steel
,
steel
,
steel
!
"
<EOS>
he
replied
fiercely
,
imitating
with
his
hand
the
thrust
of
a
sword
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
he
robbed
?
"
said
the
locksmith
.
  
<EOS>
Barnaby
caught
him
by
the
arm
,
and
nodded
"
Yes
;
"
then
pointed
towards
the
city
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
the
old
man
,
bending
over
the
body
and
looking
round
as
he
spoke
into
Barnaby
's
pale
face
,
strangely
lighted
up
by
something
that
was
NOT
intellect
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
robber
made
off
that
way
,
did
he
?
 
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
never
mind
that
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
Hold
your
torch
this
way
---
a
little
farther
off
---
<EOS>
so
.
 
<EOS>
Now
stand
quiet
,
while
I
try
to
see
what
harm
is
done
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
he
applied
himself
to
a
closer
examination
of
the
prostrate
form
,
while
Barnaby
,
holding
the
torch
as
he
had
been
directed
,
looked
on
in
silence
,
fascinated
by
interest
or
curiosity
,
but
repelled
nevertheless
by
some
strong
and
secret
horror
which
convulsed
him
in
every
nerve
.
  
<EOS>
As
he
stood
,
at
that
moment
,
half
shrinking
back
and
half
bending
forward
,
both
his
face
and
figure
were
full
in
the
strong
glare
of
the
link
,
and
as
distinctly
revealed
as
though
it
had
been
broad
day
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
about
three
-
and
-
twenty
years
old
,
and
though
rather
spare
,
of
a
fair
height
and
strong
make
.
 
<EOS>
His
hair
,
of
which
he
had
a
great
profusion
,
was
red
,
and
hanging
in
disorder
about
his
face
and
shoulders
,
gave
to
his
restless
looks
an
expression
quite
unearthly
---
enhanced
by
the
paleness
of
his
complexion
,
and
the
glassy
lustre
of
his
large
protruding
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
Startling
as
his
aspect
was
,
the
features
were
good
,
and
there
was
something
even
plaintive
in
his
wan
and
haggard
aspect
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
the
absence
of
the
soul
is
far
more
terrible
in
a
living
man
than
in
a
dead
one
;
and
in
this
unfortunate
being
its
noblest
powers
were
wanting
.
  
<EOS>
His
dress
was
of
green
,
clumsily
trimmed
here
and
there
---
apparently
by
his
own
hands
---
with
gaudy
lace
;
brightest
where
the
cloth
was
most
worn
and
soiled
,
and
poorest
where
it
was
at
the
best
.
 
<EOS>
A
pair
of
tawdry
ruffles
dangled
at
his
wrists
,
while
his
throat
was
nearly
bare
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
ornamented
his
hat
with
a
cluster
of
peacock
's
feathers
,
but
they
were
limp
and
broken
,
and
now
trailed
negligently
down
his
back
.
 
<EOS>
Girt
to
his
side
was
the
steel
hilt
of
an
old
sword
without
blade
or
scabbard
;
and
some
particoloured
ends
of
ribands
and
poor
glass
toys
completed
the
ornamental
portion
of
his
attire
.
 
<EOS>
The
fluttered
and
confused
disposition
of
all
the
motley
scraps
that
formed
his
dress
,
bespoke
,
in
a
scarcely
less
degree
than
his
eager
and
unsettled
manner
,
the
disorder
of
his
mind
,
and
by
a
grotesque
contrast
set
off
and
heightened
the
more
impressive
wildness
of
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Barnaby
,
"
said
the
locksmith
,
after
a
hasty
but
careful
inspection
,
"
this
man
is
not
dead
,
but
he
has
a
wound
in
his
side
,
and
is
in
a
fainting
-
fit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
him
,
I
know
him
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Barnaby
,
clapping
his
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
Know
him
?
"
repeated
the
locksmith
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
said
Barnaby
,
laying
his
fingers
upon
his
lips
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
went
out
to
-
day
a
wooing
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
for
a
light
guinea
that
he
should
never
go
a
wooing
again
,
for
,
if
he
did
,
some
eyes
would
grow
dim
that
are
now
as
bright
as
---
see
,
when
I
talk
of
eyes
,
the
stars
come
out
!
 
<EOS>
Whose
eyes
are
they
?
 
<EOS>
If
they
are
angels
'
eyes
,
why
do
they
look
down
here
and
see
good
men
hurt
,
and
only
wink
and
sparkle
all
the
night
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
Heaven
help
this
silly
fellow
,
"
murmured
the
perplexed
locksmith
;
"
can
he
know
this
gentleman
?
 
<EOS>
His
mother
's
house
is
not
far
off
;
I
had
better
see
if
she
can
tell
me
who
he
is
.
 
<EOS>
Barnaby
,
my
man
,
help
me
to
put
him
in
the
chaise
,
and
we
'll
ride
home
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
touch
him
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
idiot
falling
back
,
and
shuddering
as
with
a
strong
spasm
;
he
's
bloody
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
in
his
nature
,
I
know
,
"
muttered
the
locksmith
,
"
it
's
cruel
to
ask
him
,
but
I
must
have
help
.
 
<EOS>
Barnaby
---
good
Barnaby
---
<EOS>
dear
Barnaby
---
if
you
know
this
gentleman
,
for
the
sake
of
his
life
and
everybody
's
life
that
loves
him
,
help
me
to
raise
him
and
lay
him
down
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Cover
him
then
,
wrap
him
close
---
do
n't
let
me
see
it
---
<EOS>
smell
it
---
 
<EOS>
hear
the
word
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
speak
the
word
---
do
n't
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
I
'll
not
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
you
see
he
's
covered
now
.
 
<EOS>
Gently
.
 
<EOS>
Well
done
,
well
done
!
"
  
<EOS>
They
placed
him
in
the
carriage
with
great
ease
,
for
Barnaby
was
strong
and
active
,
but
all
the
time
they
were
so
occupied
he
shivered
from
head
to
foot
,
and
evidently
experienced
an
ecstasy
of
terror
.
  
<EOS>
This
accomplished
,
and
the
wounded
man
being
covered
with
Varden
's
own
greatcoat
which
he
took
off
for
the
purpose
,
they
proceeded
onward
at
a
brisk
pace
:
Barnaby
gaily
counting
the
stars
upon
his
fingers
,
and
Gabriel
inwardly
congratulating
himself
upon
having
an
adventure
now
,
which
would
silence
Mrs
Varden
on
the
subject
of
the
Maypole
,
for
that
night
,
or
there
was
no
faith
in
woman
.

Chapter
04
    
<EOS>
In
the
venerable
suburb
---
it
was
a
suburb
once
---
of
Clerkenwell
,
towards
that
part
of
its
confines
which
is
nearest
to
the
Charter
House
,
and
in
one
of
those
cool
,
shady
Streets
,
of
which
a
few
,
widely
scattered
and
dispersed
,
yet
remain
in
such
old
parts
of
the
metropolis
,
---
each
tenement
quietly
vegetating
like
an
ancient
citizen
who
long
ago
retired
from
business
,
and
dozing
on
in
its
infirmity
until
in
course
of
time
it
tumbles
down
,
and
is
replaced
by
some
extravagant
young
heir
,
flaunting
in
stucco
and
ornamental
work
,
and
all
the
vanities
of
modern
days
,
---
in
this
quarter
,
and
in
a
street
of
this
description
,
the
business
of
the
present
chapter
lies
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
time
of
which
it
treats
,
though
only
six
-
and
-
sixty
years
ago
,
a
very
large
part
of
what
is
London
now
had
no
existence
.
<EOS>
Even
in
the
brains
of
the
wildest
speculators
,
there
had
sprung
up
no
long
rows
of
streets
connecting
Highgate
with
Whitechapel
,
no
assemblages
of
palaces
in
the
swampy
levels
,
nor
little
cities
in
the
open
fields
.
 
<EOS>
Although
this
part
of
town
was
then
,
as
now
,
parcelled
out
in
streets
,
and
plentifully
peopled
,
it
wore
a
different
aspect
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
gardens
to
many
of
the
houses
,
and
trees
by
the
pavement
side
;
with
an
air
of
freshness
breathing
up
and
down
,
which
in
these
days
would
be
sought
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
Fields
were
nigh
at
hand
,
through
which
the
New
River
took
its
winding
course
,
and
where
there
was
merry
haymaking
in
the
summer
time
.
 
<EOS>
Nature
was
not
so
far
removed
,
or
hard
to
get
at
,
as
in
these
days
;
and
although
there
were
busy
trades
in
Clerkenwell
,
and
working
jewellers
by
scores
,
it
was
a
purer
place
,
with
farm
-
houses
nearer
to
it
than
many
modern
Londoners
would
readily
believe
,
and
lovers
'
walks
at
no
great
distance
,
which
turned
into
squalid
courts
,
long
before
the
lovers
of
this
age
were
born
,
or
,
as
the
phrase
goes
,
thought
of
.
  
<EOS>
In
one
of
these
streets
,
the
cleanest
of
them
all
,
and
on
the
shady
side
of
the
way
---
for
good
housewives
know
that
sunlight
damages
their
cherished
furniture
,
and
so
choose
the
shade
rather
than
its
intrusive
glare
---
there
stood
the
house
with
which
we
have
to
deal
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
modest
building
,
not
very
straight
,
not
large
,
not
tall
;
not
bold
-
faced
,
with
great
staring
windows
,
but
a
shy
,
blinking
house
,
with
a
conical
roof
going
up
into
a
peak
over
its
garret
window
of
four
small
panes
of
glass
,
like
a
cocked
hat
on
the
head
of
an
elderly
gentleman
with
one
eye
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
built
of
brick
or
lofty
stone
,
but
of
wood
and
plaster
;
it
was
not
planned
with
a
dull
and
wearisome
regard
to
regularity
,
for
no
one
window
matched
the
other
,
or
seemed
to
have
the
slightest
reference
to
anything
besides
itself
.
  
<EOS>
The
shop
---
for
it
had
a
shop
---
was
,
with
reference
to
the
first
floor
,
where
shops
usually
are
;
and
there
all
resemblance
between
it
and
any
other
shop
stopped
short
and
ceased
.
 
<EOS>
People
who
went
in
and
out
did
n't
go
up
a
flight
of
steps
to
it
,
or
walk
easily
in
upon
a
level
with
the
street
,
but
dived
down
three
steep
stairs
,
as
into
a
cellar
.
 
<EOS>
Its
floor
was
paved
with
stone
and
brick
,
as
that
of
any
other
cellar
might
be
;
and
in
lieu
of
window
framed
and
glazed
it
had
a
great
black
wooden
flap
or
shutter
,
<EOS>
nearly
breast
high
from
the
ground
,
which
turned
back
in
the
day
-
time
,
admitting
as
much
cold
air
as
light
,
and
very
often
more
.
 
<EOS>
Behind
this
shop
was
a
wainscoted
parlour
,
looking
first
into
a
paved
yard
,
and
beyond
that
again
into
a
little
terrace
garden
,
raised
some
feet
above
it
.
 
<EOS>
Any
stranger
would
have
supposed
that
this
wainscoted
parlour
,
saving
for
the
door
of
communication
by
which
he
had
entered
,
was
cut
off
and
detached
from
all
the
world
;
and
indeed
most
strangers
on
their
first
entrance
were
observed
to
grow
extremely
thoughtful
,
as
weighing
and
pondering
in
their
minds
whether
the
upper
rooms
were
only
approachable
by
ladders
from
without
;
never
suspecting
that
two
of
the
most
unassuming
and
unlikely
doors
in
existence
,
which
the
most
ingenious
mechanician
on
earth
must
of
necessity
have
supposed
to
be
the
doors
of
closets
,
opened
out
of
this
room
---
each
without
the
smallest
preparation
,
or
so
much
as
a
quarter
of
an
inch
of
passage
---
upon
two
dark
winding
flights
of
stairs
,
the
one
upward
,
the
other
downward
,
which
were
the
sole
means
of
communication
between
that
chamber
and
the
other
portions
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
With
all
these
oddities
,
there
was
not
a
neater
,
more
scrupulously
tidy
,
or
more
punctiliously
ordered
house
,
in
Clerkenwell
,
in
London
,
in
all
England
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
not
cleaner
windows
,
or
whiter
floors
,
or
brighter
Stoves
,
or
more
highly
shining
articles
of
furniture
in
old
mahogany
;
there
was
not
more
rubbing
,
scrubbing
,
burnishing
and
polishing
,
in
the
whole
street
put
together
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
this
excellence
attained
without
some
cost
and
trouble
and
great
expenditure
of
voice
,
as
the
neighbours
were
frequently
reminded
when
the
good
lady
of
the
house
overlooked
and
assisted
in
its
being
put
to
rights
on
cleaning
days
---
which
were
usually
from
Monday
morning
till
Saturday
night
,
both
days
inclusive
.
  
<EOS>
Leaning
against
the
door
-
post
of
this
,
his
dwelling
,
the
locksmith
stood
early
on
the
morning
after
he
had
met
with
the
wounded
man
,
gazing
disconsolately
at
a
great
wooden
emblem
of
a
key
,
painted
in
vivid
yellow
to
resemble
gold
,
which
dangled
from
the
house
-
front
,
and
swung
to
and
fro
with
a
mournful
creaking
noise
,
as
if
complaining
that
it
had
nothing
to
unlock
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
into
the
shop
,
which
was
so
dark
and
dingy
with
numerous
tokens
of
his
trade
,
and
so
blackened
by
the
smoke
of
a
little
forge
,
near
which
his
'
prentice
was
at
work
,
that
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
one
unused
to
such
espials
to
have
distinguished
anything
but
<EOS>
various
tools
of
uncouth
make
and
shape
,
great
bunches
of
rusty
keys
,
fragments
of
iron
,
half
-
finished
locks
,
and
such
like
things
,
which
garnished
the
walls
and
hung
in
clusters
from
the
ceiling
.
  
<EOS>
After
a
long
and
patient
contemplation
of
the
golden
key
,
and
many
such
backward
glances
,
Gabriel
stepped
into
the
road
,
and
stole
a
look
at
the
upper
windows
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
them
chanced
to
be
thrown
open
at
the
moment
,
and
a
roguish
face
met
his
;
<EOS>
a
face
lighted
up
by
the
loveliest
pair
of
sparkling
eyes
that
ever
locksmith
looked
upon
;
the
face
of
a
pretty
,
laughing
,
girl
;
dimpled
and
fresh
,
and
healthful
---
the
very
impersonation
of
good
-
humour
and
blooming
beauty
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
<EOS>
she
whispered
,
bending
forward
and
pointing
archly
to
the
window
underneath
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mother
is
still
asleep
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Still
,
my
dear
,
"
returned
the
locksmith
in
the
same
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
talk
as
if
she
had
been
asleep
all
night
,
instead
of
little
more
than
half
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
'm
very
thankful
.
 
<EOS>
Sleep
's
a
blessing
---
no
doubt
about
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
last
few
words
he
muttered
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
cruel
of
you
to
keep
us
up
so
late
this
morning
,
and
never
tell
us
where
you
were
,
or
send
us
word
!
"
said
the
girl
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
Dolly
,
Dolly
!
"
returned
the
locksmith
,
shaking
his
head
,
and
smiling
,
"
how
cruel
of
you
to
run
upstairs
to
bed
!
 
<EOS>
Come
down
to
breakfast
,
madcap
,
and
come
down
lightly
,
or
you
'll
wake
your
mother
.
 
<EOS>
She
must
be
tired
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
---
I
am
.
"
  
<EOS>
Keeping
these
latter
words
to
himself
,
and
returning
his
daughter
's
nod
,
he
was
passing
into
the
workshop
,
with
the
smile
she
had
awakened
still
beaming
on
his
face
,
when
he
just
caught
sight
of
his
'
prentice
's
brown
paper
cap
ducking
down
to
avoid
observation
,
and
shrinking
from
the
window
back
to
its
former
place
,
which
the
wearer
no
sooner
reached
than
he
began
to
hammer
lustily
.
  
<EOS>
"
Listening
again
,
Simon
!
<EOS>
"
said
Gabriel
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
bad
.
<EOS>
What
in
the
name
of
wonder
does
he
expect
the
girl
to
say
,
that
I
always
catch
him
listening
when
SHE
speaks
,
and
never
at
any
other
time
!
 
<EOS>
A
bad
habit
,
Sim
,
a
sneaking
,
underhanded
way
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
may
hammer
,
but
you
wo
n't
beat
that
out
of
me
,
if
you
work
at
it
till
your
time
's
up
!
"
  
<EOS>
So
saying
,
and
shaking
his
head
gravely
,
he
re
-
entered
the
workshop
,
and
confronted
the
subject
of
these
remarks
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
enough
of
that
just
now
,
"
said
the
locksmith
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
need
n't
make
any
more
of
that
confounded
clatter
.
 
<EOS>
Breakfast
's
ready
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
Sim
,
looking
up
with
amazing
politeness
,
and
a
peculiar
little
bow
cut
short
off
at
the
neck
,
"
I
shall
attend
you
immediately
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
"
muttered
Gabriel
,
"
that
's
out
of
the
'
Prentice
's
Garland
or
the
'
Prentice
's
Delight
,
or
the
'
Prentice
's
Warbler
,
or
the
Prentice
's
Guide
to
the
Gallows
,
or
some
such
improving
textbook
.
 
<EOS>
Now
he
's
going
to
beautify
himself
---
here
's
a
precious
locksmith
!
"
  
<EOS>
Quite
unconscious
that
his
master
was
looking
on
from
the
dark
corner
by
the
parlour
door
<EOS>
,
Sim
threw
off
the
paper
cap
,
sprang
from
his
seat
,
and
in
two
extraordinary
steps
,
something
between
skating
and
minuet
dancing
,
bounded
to
a
washing
place
at
the
other
end
of
the
shop
,
and
there
removed
from
his
face
and
hands
all
traces
of
his
previous
work
---
practising
the
same
step
all
the
time
with
the
utmost
gravity
.
 
<EOS>
This
done
,
he
drew
from
some
concealed
place
a
little
scrap
of
looking
-
glass
,
and
with
its
assistance
arranged
his
hair
,
and
ascertained
the
exact
state
of
a
little
carbuncle
on
his
nose
.
 
<EOS>
Having
now
completed
his
toilet
,
he
placed
the
fragment
of
mirror
on
a
low
bench
,
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
at
so
much
of
his
legs
as
could
be
reflected
in
that
small
compass
,
with
the
greatest
possible
complacency
and
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
Sim
,
as
he
was
called
in
the
locksmith
's
family
,
or
Mr
Simon
Tappertit
,
as
he
called
himself
,
and
required
all
men
to
style
him
out
of
doors
,
on
holidays
,
and
Sundays
out
,
---
was
an
old
-
fashioned
,
thin
-
faced
,
sleek
-
haired
,
sharp
-
nosed
,
small
-
eyed
little
fellow
,
very
little
more
than
five
feet
high
,
and
thoroughly
convinced
in
his
own
mind
that
he
was
above
the
middle
size
;
rather
tall
,
in
fact
,
than
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
Of
his
figure
,
which
was
well
enough
formed
,
though
somewhat
of
the
leanest
,
he
entertained
the
highest
admiration
;
and
with
his
legs
,
which
,
in
knee
-
breeches
,
were
perfect
curiosities
of
littleness
<EOS>
,
he
was
enraptured
to
a
degree
amounting
to
enthusiasm
.
 
<EOS>
He
also
had
some
majestic
,
shadowy
ideas
,
which
had
never
been
quite
fathomed
by
his
intimate
friends
,
concerning
the
power
of
his
eye
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
he
had
been
known
to
go
so
far
as
to
boast
that
he
could
utterly
quell
and
subdue
the
haughtiest
beauty
by
a
simple
process
,
which
he
termed
"
eyeing
her
over
;
"
but
it
must
be
added
,
that
neither
of
this
faculty
,
nor
of
the
power
he
claimed
to
have
,
through
the
same
gift
,
of
vanquishing
and
heaving
down
dumb
animals
,
even
in
a
rabid
state
,
had
he
ever
furnished
evidence
which
could
be
deemed
quite
satisfactory
and
conclusive
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
be
inferred
from
these
premises
,
that
in
the
small
body
of
Mr
Tappertit
there
was
locked
up
an
ambitious
and
aspiring
soul
.
<EOS>
As
certain
liquors
,
confined
in
casks
too
cramped
in
their
dimensions
,
will
ferment
,
and
fret
,
and
chafe
in
their
imprisonment
,
so
the
spiritual
essence
or
soul
of
Mr
Tappertit
would
sometimes
fume
within
that
precious
cask
,
his
body
,
until
,
with
great
foam
and
froth
and
splutter
,
it
would
force
a
vent
,
and
carry
all
before
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
his
custom
to
remark
,
in
reference
to
any
one
of
these
occasions
,
that
his
soul
had
got
into
his
head
;
and
in
this
novel
kind
of
intoxication
many
scrapes
and
mishaps
befell
him
,
which
he
had
frequently
concealed
with
no
small
difficulty
from
his
worthy
master
.
  
<EOS>
Sim
Tappertit
,
among
the
other
fancies
upon
which
his
before
-
mentioned
soul
was
for
ever
feasting
and
regaling
itself
(
and
which
fancies
,
like
the
liver
of
Prometheus
,
grew
as
they
were
fed
upon
)
,
had
a
mighty
notion
of
his
order
;
and
had
been
heard
by
the
servant
-
maid
openly
expressing
his
regret
that
the
'
prentices
no
longer
carried
clubs
wherewith
to
mace
the
citizens
:
that
was
his
strong
expression
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
likewise
reported
to
have
said
that
in
former
times
a
stigma
had
been
cast
upon
the
body
by
the
execution
of
George
Barnwell
,
to
which
they
should
not
have
basely
submitted
,
but
should
have
demanded
him
of
the
legislature
---
 
temperately
at
first
;
then
by
an
appeal
to
arms
,
if
necessary
---
to
be
dealt
with
as
they
in
their
wisdom
might
think
fit
.
 
<EOS>
These
thoughts
always
led
him
to
consider
what
a
glorious
engine
the
'
prentices
might
yet
become
if
they
had
but
a
master
spirit
at
their
head
;
and
then
he
would
darkly
,
and
to
the
terror
of
his
hearers
,
hint
at
certain
reckless
fellows
that
he
knew
of
,
and
at
a
certain
Lion
Heart
ready
to
become
their
captain
,
who
,
once
afoot
,
would
make
the
Lord
Mayor
tremble
on
his
throne
.
  
<EOS>
In
respect
of
dress
and
personal
decoration
,
Sim
Tappertit
was
no
less
of
an
adventurous
and
enterprising
character
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
seen
,
beyond
dispute
,
to
pull
off
ruffles
of
the
finest
quality
at
the
corner
of
the
street
on
Sunday
nights
,
and
to
put
them
carefully
in
his
pocket
before
returning
home
;
and
it
was
quite
notorious
that
on
all
great
holiday
occasions
it
was
his
habit
to
exchange
his
plain
steel
knee
-
buckles
for
a
pair
of
glittering
paste
,
under
cover
of
a
friendly
post
,
planted
most
conveniently
in
that
same
spot
.
 
<EOS>
Add
to
this
that
he
was
in
years
<EOS>
just
twenty
,
in
his
looks
much
older
,
and
in
conceit
at
least
two
hundred
;
that
he
had
no
objection
to
be
jested
with
,
touching
his
admiration
of
his
master
's
daughter
;
and
had
even
,
when
called
upon
at
a
certain
obscure
tavern
to
pledge
the
lady
whom
he
honoured
with
his
love
,
toasted
,
with
many
winks
and
leers
,
a
fair
creature
whose
Christian
name
,
he
said
,
began
with
a
D
---
 
;
---
and
as
much
is
known
of
Sim
Tappertit
,
who
has
by
this
time
followed
the
locksmith
in
to
breakfast
,
as
is
necessary
to
be
known
in
making
his
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
substantial
meal
;
for
,
over
and
above
the
ordinary
tea
equipage
,
the
board
creaked
beneath
the
weight
of
a
jolly
round
of
beef
,
a
ham
of
the
first
magnitude
,
and
sundry
towers
of
buttered
Yorkshire
cake
,
piled
slice
upon
slice
in
most
alluring
order
.
<EOS>
There
was
also
a
goodly
jug
of
well
-
browned
clay
,
fashioned
into
the
form
of
an
old
gentleman
,
not
by
any
means
unlike
the
locksmith
,
atop
of
whose
bald
head
was
a
fine
white
froth
answering
to
his
wig
,
indicative
,
beyond
dispute
,
of
sparkling
home
-
brewed
ale
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
better
far
than
fair
home
-
brewed
,
or
Yorkshire
cake
,
or
ham
,
or
beef
,
or
anything
to
eat
or
drink
that
earth
or
air
or
water
can
supply
,
there
sat
,
presiding
over
all
,
the
locksmith
's
rosy
daughter
,
before
whose
dark
eyes
even
beef
grew
insignificant
,
and
malt
became
as
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
Fathers
should
never
kiss
their
daughters
when
young
men
are
by
.
<EOS>
It
's
too
much
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
bounds
to
human
endurance
.
 
<EOS>
So
thought
Sim
Tappertit
when
Gabriel
drew
those
rosy
lips
to
his
---
those
lips
within
Sim
's
reach
from
day
to
day
,
and
yet
so
far
off
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
respect
for
his
master
,
but
he
wished
the
Yorkshire
cake
might
choke
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Father
,
"
said
the
locksmith
's
daughter
,
when
this
salute
was
over
,
and
they
took
their
seats
at
table
,
<EOS>
"
what
is
this
I
hear
about
last
night
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
true

Young

Ay
---
Mr
Edward
.
 
<EOS>
And
beside
him
,
Barnaby
,
calling
for
help
with
all
his
might
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
well
<EOS>
it
happened
as
it
did
;
for
the
road
's
a
lonely
one
,
the
hour
was
late
,
and
,
the
night
being
cold
,
and
poor
Barnaby
even
less
sensible
than
usual
from
surprise
and
fright
,
the
young
gentleman
might
have
met
his
death
in
a
very
short
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dread
to
think
of
it
!
"
<EOS>
cried
his
daughter
with
a
shudder
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
did
you
know
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Know
him
!
"
returned
the
locksmith
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
know
him
---
how
could
I
?
 
<EOS>
I
had
never
seen
him
,
often
as
I
had
heard
and
spoken
of
him
.
<EOS>
I
took
him
to
Mrs
Rudge

and
she
no
sooner
saw
him
than
the
truth
came
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Emma
,
father
---
If
this
news
should
reach
her
,
enlarged
upon
as
it
is
sure
to
be

she
will
go
distracted
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
lookye
there
again
,
how
a
man
suffers
for
being
good
-
natured
,
"
said
the
locksmith
.
 
<EOS>
"
Miss
Emma
was
with
her
uncle
at
the
masquerade
at
Carlisle
House
,
where
she
had
gone
,
as
the
people
at
the
Warren
told
me
,
sorely
against
her
will
.
 
<EOS>
What
does
your
blockhead
father
when
he
and
Mrs
Rudge
have
laid
their
heads
together
,
but
goes
there
when
he
ought
to
be
abed
,
makes
interest
with
his
friend
the
doorkeeper
,
slips
him
on
a
mask
and
domino
,
and
mixes
with
the
masquers
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
like
himself
to
do
so
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
girl
,
putting
her
fair
arm
round
his
neck
,
and
giving
him
a
most
enthusiastic
kiss
.
  
<EOS>
"
Like
himself
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Gabriel
,
affecting
to
grumble
,
but
evidently
delighted
with
the
part
he
had
taken
,
and
with
her
praise
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
like
himself
---
so
your
mother
said
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
he
mingled
with
the
crowd
,
and
prettily
worried
and
badgered
he
was
,
I
warrant
you
,
with
people
squeaking
,
"
Do
n't
you
know
me
?
"
<EOS>
and
"
I
've
found
you
out

and
all
that
kind
of
nonsense
in
his
ears
.
 
<EOS>
He
might
have
wandered
on
till
now
,
but
in
a
little
room
there
was
a
young
lady
who
had
taken
off
her
mask
,
on
account
of
the
place
being
very
warm
,
and
was
sitting
there
alone
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
that
was
she
?
"
said
his
daughter
hastily
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
that
was
she
,
"
replied
the
locksmith
;
"
and
I
no
sooner
whispered
to
her
what
the
matter
was
---
as
softly
,
Doll
,
and
with
nearly
as
much
art
as
you
could
have
used
yourself
---
than
she
gives
a
kind
of
scream
and
faints
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
do
---
what
happened
next
?
"
asked
his
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
the
masks
came
flocking
round
,
with
a
general
noise
and
hubbub
,
and
I
thought
myself
in
luck
to
get
clear
off
,
that
's
all
,
"
rejoined
the
locksmith
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
happened
when
I
reached
home
you
may
guess
,
if
you
did
n't
hear
it

Ah

Well

it
's

Put
Toby
this
way
,
my
dear

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
Toby
was
the
brown
jug
of
which
previous
mention
has
been
made
.
 
<EOS>
Applying
his
lips
to
the
worthy
old
gentleman
's
benevolent
forehead
,
the
locksmith
,
who
had
all
this
time
been
ravaging
among
the
eatables
,
kept
them
there
so
long
,
at
the
same
time
raising
the
vessel
slowly
in
the
air
,
that
at
length
Toby
stood
on
his
head
upon
his
nose
,
when
he
smacked
his
lips
,
and
set
him
on
the
table
again
with
fond
reluctance
.
  
<EOS>
Although
Sim
Tappertit
had
taken
no
share
in
this
conversation
,
no
part
of
it
being
addressed
to
him
,
he
had
not
been
wanting
in
such
silent
manifestations
of
astonishment
,
as
he
deemed
most
compatible
with
the
favourable
display
of
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
Regarding
the
pause
which
now
ensued
,
as
a
particularly
advantageous
opportunity
for
doing
great
execution
with
them
upon
the
locksmith
's
daughter
(
who
he
had
no
doubt
was
looking
at
him
in
mute
admiration
)
,
he
began
to
screw
and
twist
his
face
,
and
especially
those
features
,
into
such
extraordinary
,
hideous
,
and
unparalleled
contortions
,
that
Gabriel
,
who
happened
to
look
towards
him
,
was
stricken
with
amazement
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
the
devil
's
the
matter
with
the
lad
?
"
<EOS>
cried
the
locksmith
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
he
choking
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
?
"
demanded
Sim
,
with
some
disdain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
you
,
"
returned
his
master
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
by
making
those
horrible
faces
over
your
breakfast
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Faces
are
matters
of
taste
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
,
rather
discomfited
;
<EOS>
not
the
less
so
because
he
saw
the
locksmith
's
daughter
smiling
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sim
,
"
rejoined
Gabriel
,
laughing
heartily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
a
fool
,
for
I
'd
rather
see
you
in
your
senses
.
 
<EOS>
These
young
fellows
,
"
he
added
,
turning
to
his
daughter
,
"
are
always
committing
some
folly
or
another

<EOS>
There
was
a
quarrel
between
Joe
Willet
and
old
John
last
night
though
I
ca
n't
say
Joe
was
much
in
fault
either
.
 
<EOS>
He
'll
be
missing
one
of
these
mornings
,
and
will
have
gone
away
upon
some
wild
-
goose
errand
,
seeking
his
fortune
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Why
,
what
's
the
matter
,
Doll
?
 
<EOS>
YOU
are
making
faces
now
.
 
<EOS>
The
girls
are
as
bad
as
the
boys
every
bit
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
tea
,
"
said
Dolly
,
turning
alternately
very
red
and
very
white
,
which
is
no
doubt
the
effect
of
a
slight
scald
---
"
so
very
hot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Tappertit
looked
immensely
big
at
a
quartern
loaf
on
the
table
,
and
breathed
hard
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
all
?
"
returned
the
locksmith
.
 
<EOS>
"
Put
some
more
milk
in
it
.
<EOS>
---
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
am
sorry
for
Joe
,
because
he
is
a
likely
young
fellow
,
and
gains
upon
one
every
time
one
sees
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
'll
start
off
,
you
'll
find
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
he
told
me
as
much
himself
!
"
  
"
<EOS>
Indeed
!
"
cried
Dolly
in
a
faint
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
-
deed
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
the
tea
tickling
your
throat
still
,
my
dear
?
"
said
the
locksmith
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
before
his
daughter
could
make
him
any
answer
,
she
was
taken
with
a
troublesome
cough
,
and
it
was
such
a
very
unpleasant
cough
,
that
,
when
she
left
off
,
the
tears
were
starting
in
her
bright
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
The
good
-
natured
locksmith
was
still
patting
her
on
the
back
and
applying
such
gentle
restoratives
,
when
a
message
arrived
from
Mrs
Varden
,
making
known
to
all
whom
it
might
concern
,
that
she
felt
too
much
indisposed
to
rise
after
her
great
agitation
and
anxiety
of
the
previous
night
;
and
therefore
desired
to
be
immediately
accommodated
with
the
little
black
teapot
of
strong
mixed
tea
,
a
couple
of
rounds
of
buttered
toast
,
a
middling
-
sized
dish
of
beef
and
ham
cut
thin
,
and
the
Protestant
Manual
in
two
volumes
post
octavo
.
 
<EOS>
Like
some
other
ladies
who
in
remote
ages
flourished
upon
this
globe
,
Mrs
Varden
was
most
devout
when
most
ill
-
tempered
.
 
<EOS>
Whenever
she
and
her
husband
were
at
unusual
variance
,
then
the
Protestant
Manual
was
in
high
feather
.
  
<EOS>
Knowing
from
experience
what
these
requests
portended
,
the
triumvirate
broke
up
;
Dolly
,
to
see
the
orders
executed
with
all
despatch
;
Gabriel
,
to
some
out
-
of
-
door
work
in
his
little
chaise
;
and
Sim
,
to
his
daily
duty
in
the
workshop
,
to
which
retreat
he
carried
the
big
look
,
although
the
loaf
remained
behind
.
  
<EOS>
Indeed
the
big
look
increased
immensely
,
and
when
he
had
tied
his
apron
on
,
became
quite
gigantic
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
until
he
had
several
times
walked
up
and
down
with
folded
arms
,
and
the
longest
strides
be
could
take
,
and
had
kicked
a
great
many
small
articles
out
of
his
way
,
that
his
lip
began
to
curl
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
a
gloomy
derision
came
upon
his
features
,
and
he
smiled
;
uttering
meanwhile
with
supreme
contempt
the
monosyllable
"
Joe
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
eyed
her
over
,
while
he
talked
about
the
fellow
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
that
was
of
course
the
reason
of
her
being
confused
.
 
<EOS>
Joe
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
walked
up
and
down
again
much
quicker
than
before
,
and
if
possible
with
longer
strides
;
sometimes
stopping
to
take
a
glance
at
his
legs
,
and
sometimes
to
jerk
out
,
and
cast
from
him
,
another
"
Joe
!
"
 
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
so
he
again
assumed
the
paper
cap
and
tried
to
work
.
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
done
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
do
nothing
to

day

said
Mr
Tappertit
,
dashing
it
down
again
,
"
but
grind

<EOS>
I
'll
grind
up
all
the
tools

Grinding
will
suit
my
present
humour
well

The
grindstone
was
soon
in

;

showers

face
upon

sleeve

As
soon
as
the
business
of
the
day
was
over
,
the
locksmith
sallied
forth
,
alone
,
to
visit
the
wounded
gentleman
and
ascertain
the
progress
of
his
recovery
.
 
<EOS>
The
house
where
he
had
left
him
was
in
a
by
-
street
in
Southwark
,
not
far
from
London
Bridge
;
and
thither
he
hied
with
all
speed
,
bent
upon
returning
with
as
little
delay
as
might
be
,
and
getting
to
bed
betimes
.
  
<EOS>
The
evening
was
boisterous
---
scarcely
better
than
the
previous
night
had
been
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
easy
for
a
stout
man
like
Gabriel
to
keep
his
legs
at
the
street
corners
,
or
to
make
head
against
the
high
wind
,
which
often
fairly
got
the
better
of
him
,
and
drove
him
back
some
paces
,
or
,
in
defiance
of
all
his
energy
,
forced
him
to
take
shelter
in
an
arch
or
doorway
until
the
fury
of
the
gust
was
spent
.
<EOS>
Occasionally
a
hat
or
wig
,
or
both
,
came
spinning
and
trundling
past
him
,
like
a
mad
thing
;
while
the
more
serious
spectacle
of
falling
tiles
and
slates
,
or
of
masses
of
brick
and
mortar
or
fragments
of
stone
-
coping
rattling
upon
the
pavement
near
at
hand
,
and
splitting
into
fragments
,
did
not
increase
the
pleasure
of
the
journey
,
or
make
the
way
less
dreary
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
trying
night
for
a
man
like
me
to
walk
in
!
"
said
the
locksmith
,
as
he
knocked
softly
at
the
widow
's
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'd
rather
be
in
old
John
's
chimney
-
corner
,
faith
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
's
there
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
a
woman
's
voice
from
within
.
 
<EOS>
Being
answered
,
it
added
a
hasty
word
of
welcome
,
and
the
door
was
quickly
opened
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
about
forty
---
<EOS>
perhaps
two
or
three
years
older
---
with
a
cheerful
aspect
,
and
a
face
that
had
once
been
pretty
.
 
<EOS>
It
bore
traces
of
affliction
and
care
,
but
they
were
of
an
old
date
,
and
Time
had
smoothed
them
.
 
<EOS>
Any
one
who
had
bestowed
but
a
casual
glance
on
Barnaby
might
have
known
that
this
was
his
mother
,
from
the
strong
resemblance
between
them
;
but
where
in
his
face
there
was
wildness
and
vacancy
,
<EOS>
in
hers
there
was
the
patient
composure
of
long
effort
and
quiet
resignation
.
  
<EOS>
One
thing
about
this
face
was
very
strange
and
startling
.
 
<EOS>
You
could
not
look
upon
it
in
its
most
cheerful
mood
without
feeling
that
it
had
some
extraordinary
capacity
of
expressing
terror
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
on
the
surface
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
in
no
one
feature
that
it
lingered
.
<EOS>
You
could
not
take
the
eyes
or
mouth
,
or
lines
upon
the
cheek
,
and
say
,
if
this
or
that
were
otherwise
,
it
would
not
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
there
it
always
lurked
---
<EOS>
something
for
ever
dimly
seen
,
but
ever
there
,
and
never
absent
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
faintest
,
palest
shadow
of
some
look
,
to
which
an
instant
of
intense
and
most
unutterable
horror
only
could
have
given
birth
;
but
indistinct
and
feeble
as
it
was
,
it
did
suggest
what
that
look
must
have
been
,
and
fixed
it
in
the
mind
as
if
it
had
had
existence
in
a
dream
.
  
<EOS>
More
faintly
imaged
,
and
wanting
force
and
purpose
,
as
it
were
,
because
of
his
darkened
intellect
,
there
was
this
same
stamp
upon
the
son
.
 
<EOS>
Seen
in
a
picture
,
it
must
have
had
some
legend
with
it
,
and
would
have
haunted
those
who
looked
upon
the
canvas
.
 
<EOS>
They
who
knew
the
Maypole
story
,
and
could
remember
what
the
widow
was
,
before
her
husband
's
and
his
master
's
murder
,
understood
it
well
.
<EOS>
They
recollected
how
the
change
had
come
,
and
could
call
to
mind
that
when
her
son
was
born
,
upon
the
very
day
the
deed
was
known
,
he
bore
upon
his
wrist
what
seemed
a
smear
of
blood
but
half
washed
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
save
you
,
neighbour
!
"
<EOS>
said
the
locksmith
,
as
he
followed
her
,
with
the
air
of
an
old
friend
,
into
a
little
parlour
where
a
cheerful
fire
was
burning
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
,
"
she
answered
smiling
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
kind
heart
has
brought
you
here
again
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
will
keep
you
at
home
,
I
know
of
old
,
if
there
are
friends
to
serve
or
comfort
,
out
of
doors
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tut
,
tut
,
"
returned
the
locksmith
,
rubbing
his
hands
and
warming
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
women
are
such
talkers
.
 
<EOS>
What
of
the
patient
,
neighbour
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
sleeping
now
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
very
restless
towards
daylight
,
and
for
some
hours
tossed
and
tumbled
sadly
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
fever
has
left
him
,
and
the
doctor
says
he
will
soon
mend
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
not
be
removed
until
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
had
visitors
to
-
day
---
humph
?
"
said
Gabriel
,
slyly
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
Old
Mr
Chester
has
been
here
ever
since
we
sent
for
him
,
and
had
not
been
gone
many
minutes
when
you
knocked
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
ladies
?
"
said
Gabriel
,
elevating
his
eyebrows
and
looking
disappointed
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
letter
,
"
replied
the
widow
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
better
than
nothing
!
"
<EOS>
replied
the
locksmith
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
was
the
bearer
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Barnaby
,
of
course
.
"
  
"
Barnaby
's
a
jewel
!
<EOS>
"
said
Varden
;
"
and
comes
and
goes
with
ease
where
we
who
think
ourselves
much
wiser
would
make
but
a
poor
hand
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
not
out
wandering
,
again
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
Heaven
<EOS>
he
is
in
his
bed
;
having
been
up
all
night
,
as
you
know
,
and
on
his
feet
all
day
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
quite
tired
out
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
neighbour
<EOS>
,
if
I
could
but
see
him
oftener
so
---
if
I
could
but
tame
down
that
terrible
restlessness
---
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
good
time
,
"
said
the
locksmith
,
kindly
,
"
in
good
time
---
do
n't
be
down
-
hearted
.
 
<EOS>
To
my
mind
he
grows
wiser
every
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
widow
shook
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
,
though
she
knew
the
locksmith
sought
to
cheer
her
,
and
spoke
from
no
conviction
of
his
own
,
she
was
glad
to
hear
even
this
praise
of
her
poor
benighted
son
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
be
a
"
cute
man
yet
,
"
resumed
the
locksmith
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
care
,
when
we
are
growing
old
and
foolish
,
Barnaby
does
n't
put
us
to
the
blush
,
that
's
all
.
 
<EOS>
But
our
other
friend
<EOS>
,
"
he
added
,
looking
under
the
table
and
about
the
floor
---
"
sharpest
and
cunningest
of
all
the
sharp
and
cunning
ones
<EOS>
---
where
's
he
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
Barnaby
's
room
,
"
rejoined
the
widow
,
with
a
faint
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
He
's
a
knowing
blade
!
"
<EOS>
said
Varden
,
shaking
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
sorry
to
talk
secrets
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
He
's
a
deep
customer
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
no
doubt
he
can
read
,
and
write
,
and
cast
accounts
if
he
chooses
.
 
<EOS>
What
was
that
?
 
<EOS>
Him
tapping
at
the
door
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
returned
the
widow
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
in
the
street
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
Hark
!
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
There
again
!
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
some
one
knocking
softly
at
the
shutter
.
<EOS>
Who
can
it
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
They
had
been
speaking
in
a
low
tone
,
for
the
invalid
lay
overhead
,
and
the
walls
and
ceilings
being
thin
and
poorly
built
,
the
sound
of
their
voices
might
otherwise
have
disturbed
his
slumber
.
 
<EOS>
The
party
without
,
whoever
it
was
,
could
have
stood
close
to
the
shutter
without
hearing
anything
spoken
;
and
,
seeing
the
light
through
the
chinks
and
finding
all
so
quiet
,
might
have
been
persuaded
that
only
one
person
was
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
Some
thief
or
ruffian
maybe
,
"
said
the
locksmith
.
 
<EOS>
"
Give
me
the
light
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
she
returned
hastily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Such
visitors
have
never
come
to
this
poor
dwelling
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
stay
here
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
within
call
,
at
the
worst
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
rather
go
myself
---
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
said
the
locksmith
,
unwillingly
relinquishing
the
candle
he
had
caught
up
from
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
---
I
do
n't
know
why
---
because
the
wish
is
so
strong
upon
me
,
"
she
rejoined
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
again
---
do
not
detain
me
,
I
beg
of
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
Gabriel
looked
at
her
,
in
great
surprise
to
see
one
who
was
usually
so
mild
and
quiet
thus
agitated
,
and
with
so
little
cause
.
 
<EOS>
She
left
the
room
and
closed
the
door
behind
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
stood
for
a
moment
as
if
hesitating
,
with
her
hand
upon
the
lock
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
short
interval
the
knocking
came
again
,
and
a
voice
close
to
the
window
---
a
voice
the
locksmith
seemed
to
recollect
,
and
to
have
some
disagreeable
association
with
---
whispered
"
Make
haste
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
words
were
uttered
in
that
low
distinct
voice
which
finds
its
way
so
readily
to
sleepers
'
ears
,
and
wakes
them
in
a
fright
.
 
<EOS>
For
a
moment
it
startled
even
the
locksmith
;
who
involuntarily
drew
back
from
the
window
,
and
listened
.
  
<EOS>
The
wind
rumbling
in
the
chimney
made
it
difficult
to
hear
what
passed
,
but
he
could
tell
that
the
door
was
opened
,
that
there
was
the
tread
of
a
man
upon
the
creaking
boards
,
and
then
a
moment
's
silence
---
broken
by
a
suppressed
something
which
was
not
a
shriek
,
or
groan
,
or
cry
for
help
,
and
yet
might
have
been
either
or
all
three
;
and
the
words
"
My
God
!
"
<EOS>
uttered
in
a
voice
it
chilled
him
to
hear
.
  
<EOS>
He
rushed
out
upon
the
instant
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
at
last
,
was
that
dreadful
look
---
the
very
one
<EOS>
he
seemed
to
know
so
well
and
yet
had
never
seen
before
---
upon
her
face
.
 
<EOS>
There
she
stood
,
frozen
to
the
ground
,
gazing
with
starting
eyes
,
and
livid
cheeks
,
and
every
feature
fixed
and
ghastly
,
upon
the
man
he
had
encountered
in
the
dark
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
His
eyes
met
those
of
the
locksmith
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
but
a
flash
,
an
instant
,
a
breath
upon
a
polished
glass
,
and
<EOS>
he
was
gone
.
  
<EOS>
The
locksmith
was
upon
him
---
had
the
skirts
of
his
streaming
garment
almost
in
his
grasp
---
when
his
arms
were
tightly
clutched
,
and
the
widow
flung
herself
upon
the
ground
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
other
way
---
the
other
way
,
"
she
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
went
the
other
way
.
<EOS>
Turn
---
turn
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
other
way
!
 
<EOS>
I
see
him
now
,
"
rejoined
the
locksmith
,
pointing
---
 
<EOS>
"
yonder
---
there
<EOS>
---
there
is
his
shadow
passing
by
that
light
.
 
<EOS>
What
---
 
<EOS>
who
is
this
?
 
<EOS>
Let
me
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
back
,
come
back
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
woman
,
clasping
him
;
"
Do
not
touch
him
on
your
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
charge
you
,
come
back
.
 
<EOS>
He
carries
other
lives
besides
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
Come
back
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
does
this
mean
?
"
cried
the
locksmith
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
matter
what
it
means
,
do
n't
ask
,
do
n't
speak
,
do
n't
think
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
not
to
be
followed
,
checked
,
or
stopped
.
 
<EOS>
Come
back
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
man
looked
at
her
in
wonder
,
as
she
writhed
and
clung
about
him
;
and
,
borne
down
by
her
passion
,
suffered
her
to
drag
him
into
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
until
she
had
chained
and
double
-
locked
the
door
,
fastened
every
bolt
and
bar
with
the
heat
and
fury
of
a
maniac
,
and
drawn
him
back
into
the
room
,
that
she
turned
upon
him
,
once
again
,
that
stony
look
of
horror
,
and
,
sinking
down
into
a
chair
,
covered
her
face
,
and
shuddered
,
as
though
the
hand
of
death
were
on
her
.

Chapter

<EOS>
Beyond
all
measure
astonished
by
the
strange
occurrences
which
had
passed
with
so
much
violence
and
rapidity
,
the
locksmith
gazed
upon
the
shuddering
figure
in
the
chair
like
one
half
stupefied
,
and
would
have
gazed
much
longer
,
<EOS>
had
not
his
tongue
been
loosened
by
compassion
and
humanity
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
ill
,
"
said
Gabriel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
call
some
neighbour
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
for
the
world
,
"
she
rejoined
,
motioning
to
him
with
her
trembling
hand
,
and
holding
her
face
averted
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
enough
that
you
have
been
by
,
to
see
this
.
"
  
"
Nay
,
more
than
enough
---
or
less
,
"
said
Gabriel
.
  
<EOS>
"
Be
it
so
,
"
she
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
you
like
.
 
<EOS>
Ask
me
no
questions
,
I
entreat
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Neighbour
,
"
said
the
locksmith
,
after
a
pause
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
this
fair
,
or
reasonable
,
or
just
to
yourself
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
like
you
,
who
have
known
me
so
long
and
sought
my
advice
in
all
matters
---
<EOS>
like
you
,
who
from
a
girl
have
had
a
strong
mind
and
a
staunch
heart
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
need
of
them
,
"
she
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
growing
old
,
both
in
years
and
care
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
that
,
and
too
much
trial
,
have
made
them
weaker
than
they
used
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
Do
not
speak
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
see
what
I
have
seen
,
and
hold
my
peace
!
"
returned
the
locksmith
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
was
that
man
,
and
why
has
his
coming
made
this
change
in
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
silent
,
but
held
to
the
chair
as
though
to
save
herself
from
falling
on
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
take
the
licence
of
an
old
acquaintance
,
Mary
,
"
said
the
locksmith
,
"
who
has
ever
had
a
warm
regard
for
you
,
and
maybe
has
tried
to
prove
it
when
he
could
.
 
<EOS>
Who
is
this
ill
-
favoured
man
,
and
what
has
he
to
do
with
you
?
 
<EOS>
Who
is
this
ghost
<EOS>
,
that
is
only
seen
in
the
black
nights
and
bad
weather
?
 
<EOS>
How
does
he
know
,
and
why
does
he
haunt
,
this
house
,
whispering
through
chinks
and
crevices
,
as
if
there
was
that
between
him
and
you
,
which
neither
durst
so
much
as
speak
aloud
of
?
 
<EOS>
Who
is
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
well
to
say
he
haunts
this
house
,
"
returned
the
widow
,
faintly
.
 
<EOS>
"
His
shadow
has
been
upon
it
and
me
,
in
light
and
darkness
,
at
noonday
and
midnight
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
,
at
last
,
he
has
come
in
the
body
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
would
n't
have
gone
in
the
body
,
"
returned
the
locksmith
with
some
irritation
,
"
if
you
had
left
my
arms
and
legs
at
liberty
.
<EOS>
What
riddle
is
this
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
one
,
"
she
answered
,
rising
as
she
spoke
,
"
that
must
remain
for
ever
as
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
not
say
more
than
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Dare
not
!
"
repeated
the
wondering
locksmith
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
not
press
me
,
"
she
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sick
and
faint
,
and
every
faculty
of
life
seems
dead
within
me
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
No
!
---
Do
not
touch
me
,
either
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gabriel
,
who
had
stepped
forward
to
render
her
assistance
,
fell
back
as
she
made
this
hasty
exclamation
,
and
regarded
her
in
silent
wonder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
go
my
way
alone
,
"
she
said
in
a
low
voice
,
"
and
let
the
hands
of
no
honest
man
touch
mine
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
When
she
had
tottered
to
the
door
,
she
turned
,
and
added
with
a
stronger
effort
,
"
This
is
a
secret
,
which
,
of
necessity
,
I
trust
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
a
true
man
.
 
<EOS>
As
you
have
ever
been
good
and
kind
to
me
,
---
keep
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
any
noise
was
heard
above
,
make
some
excuse
---
say
anything
<EOS>
but
what
you
really
saw
,
and
never
let
a
word
or
look
between
us
,
recall
this
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
I
trust
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Mind
,
I
trust
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
How
much
I
trust
,
you
never
can
conceive
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Casting
her
eyes
upon
him
for
an
instant
,
she
withdrew
,
and
left
him
there
alone
.
  
<EOS>
Gabriel
,
not
knowing
what
to
think
,
stood
staring
at
the
door
with
a
countenance
full
of
surprise
and
dismay
.
 
<EOS>
The
more
he
pondered
on
what
had
passed
,
the
less
able
he
was
to
give
it
any
favourable
interpretation
.
 
<EOS>
To
find
this
widow
woman
,
whose
life
for
so
many
years
had
been
supposed
to
be
one
of
solitude
and
retirement
,
and
who
,
in
her
quiet
suffering
character
,
had
gained
the
good
opinion
and
respect
of
all
who
knew
her
---
to
find
her
linked
mysteriously
with
an
ill
-
omened
man
,
alarmed
at
his
appearance
,
and
yet
favouring
his
escape
,
was
a
discovery
that
pained
as
much
as
startled
him
.
 
<EOS>
Her
reliance
on
his
secrecy
,
and
his
tacit
acquiescence
,
increased
his
distress
of
mind
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
had
spoken
boldly
,
persisted
in
questioning
her
,
detained
her
when
she
rose
to
leave
the
room
,
made
any
kind
of
protest
,
instead
of
silently
compromising
himself
,
as
he
felt
he
had
done
,
he
would
have
been
more
at
ease
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
did
I
let
her
say
it
was
a
secret
,
and
she
trusted
it
to
me
!
"
<EOS>
said
Gabriel
,
putting
his
wig
on
one
side
to
scratch
his
head
with
greater
ease
,
and
looking
ruefully
at
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
more
readiness
than
old
John
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Why
did
n't
I
say
firmly
,
"
You
have
no
right
to
such
secrets
,
and
I
demand
of
you
to
tell
me
what
this
means
,
"
instead
of
standing
gaping
at
her
,
like
an
old
moon
-
calf
as
I
am
!
 
<EOS>
But
there
's
my
weakness
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
be
obstinate
enough
with
men
<EOS>
if
need
be
,
but
women
may
twist
me
round
their
fingers
at
their
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
took
his
wig
off
outright
as
he
made
this
reflection
,
and
,
warming
his
handkerchief
at
the
fire
began
to
rub
and
polish
his
bald
head
with
it
,
until
it
glistened
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
yet
,
"
said
the
locksmith
,
softening
under
this
soothing
process
,
and
stopping
to
smile
,
"
it
MAY
be
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Any
drunken
brawler
trying
to
make
his
way
into
the
house
,
would
have
alarmed
a
quiet
soul
like
her
.
 
<EOS>
But
then
"
---
and
here
was
the
vexation
<EOS>
---
"
how
came
it
to
be
that
man
<EOS>
;
how
comes
he
to
have
this
influence
over
her
;
how
came
she
to
favour
his
getting
away
from
me
;
and
,
more
than
all
,
how
came
she
not
to
say
it
was
a
sudden
fright
,
and
nothing
more
?
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
sad
thing
to
have
,
in
one
minute
,
reason
to
mistrust
a
person
I
have
known
so
long
,
and
an
old
sweetheart
into
the
bargain
;
but
what
else
can
I
do
,
with
all
this
upon
my
mind
!
<EOS>
---
 
<EOS>
Is
that
Barnaby
outside
there
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
looking
in
and
nodding
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sure
enough
it
's
Barnaby
---
how
did
you
guess
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
By
your
shadow
,
"
said
the
locksmith
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oho
!
"
cried
Barnaby
,
glancing
over
his
shoulder
,
"
He
's
a
merry
fellow
,
that
shadow
,
and
keeps
close
to
me
,
though
I
AM
silly
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
such
pranks
,
such
walks
,
such
runs
,
such
gambols
on
the
grass
!
<EOS>
Sometimes
he
'll
be
half
as
tall
as
a
church
steeple
,
and
sometimes
no
bigger
than
a
dwarf
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
he
goes
on
before
,
and
now
behind
,
and
anon
he
'll
be
stealing
on
,
on
this
side
,
or
on
that
,
stopping
whenever
I
stop
,
and
thinking
I
ca
n't
see
him
,
though
I
have
my
eye
on
him
sharp
enough
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
he
's
a
merry
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
---
is
he
silly
too
?
 
<EOS>
I
think
he
is
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
asked
Gabriel
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
be
never
tires
of
mocking
me
,
but
does
it
all
day
long
.
<EOS>
---
 
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
you
come
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
?
"
  
"
Upstairs
.
 
<EOS>
He
wants
you
.
 
<EOS>
Stay
<EOS>
---
where
's
HIS
shadow
?
 
<EOS>
Come
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
a
wise
man
;
tell
me
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Beside
him
,
Barnaby
;
beside
him
,
I
suppose
,
"
returned
the
locksmith
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
<EOS>
he
replied
,
shaking
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
Guess
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Gone
out
a
walking
,
maybe
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
changed
shadows
with
a
woman
,
"
the
idiot
whispered
in
his
ear
,
and
then
fell
back
with
a
look
of
triumph
.
 
<EOS>
"
Her
shadow
's
always
with
him
,
and
his
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
sport
<EOS>
I
think
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Barnaby
,
"
said
the
locksmith
,
with
a
grave
look
;
"
come
hither
,
lad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
you
want
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
replied
,
keeping
away
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
'm
cunning
,
I
'm
silent
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
say
so
much
to
you
---
are
you
ready
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
he
caught
up
the
light
,
and
waved
it
with
a
wild
laugh
above
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Softly
---
gently
,
"
said
the
locksmith
,
exerting
all
his
influence
to
keep
him
calm
and
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
had
been
asleep
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
HAVE
been
asleep
,
"
he
rejoined
,
with
widely
-
opened
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
There
have
been
great
faces
coming
and
going
---
close
to
my
face
,
and
then
a
mile
away
---
low
places
to
creep
through
,
whether
I
would
or
no
---
high
churches
to
fall
down
from
---
strange
creatures
crowded
up
together
neck
and
heels
,
to
sit
upon
the
bed
---
that
's
sleep
,
eh
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dreams
,
Barnaby
,
dreams
,
"
said
the
locksmith
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dreams
!
"
<EOS>
he
echoed
softly
,
drawing
closer
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Those
are
not
dreams
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
are
,
"
replied
the
locksmith
,
"
if
they
are
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dreamed
,
"
said
Barnaby
,
passing
his
arm
through
Varden
's
,
and
peering
close
into
his
face
as
he
answered
in
a
whisper
,
"
I
dreamed
just
now
that
something
---
it
was
in
the
shape
of
a
man
---
followed
me
---
 
came
softly
after
me
---
would
n't
let
me
be
---
but
was
always
hiding
and
crouching
,
like
a
cat
in
dark
corners
,
waiting
till
I
should
pass
;
when
it
crept
out
and
came
softly
after
me
.
<EOS>
---
Did
you
ever
see
me
run
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Many
a
time
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
never
saw
me
run
as
I
did
in
this
dream
.
 
<EOS>
Still
it
came
creeping
on
to
worry
me
.
 
<EOS>
Nearer
,
nearer
,
nearer
<EOS>
---
I
ran
faster
---
 
leaped
---
<EOS>
sprung
out
of
bed
,
and
to
the
window
---
and
there
,
in
the
street
below
---
but
he
is
waiting
for
us
.
 
<EOS>
Are
you
coming
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
in
the
street
below
,
Barnaby
?
"
said
Varden
,
imagining
that
he
traced
some
connection
between
this
vision
and
what
had
actually
occurred
.
  
<EOS>
Barnaby
looked
into
his
face
,
muttered
incoherently
,
waved
the
light
above
his
head
again
,
laughed
,
and
drawing
the
locksmith
's
arm
more
tightly
through
his
own
,
led
him
up
the
stairs
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
They
entered
a
homely
bedchamber
,
garnished
in
a
scanty
way
with
chairs
,
whose
spindle
-
shanks
bespoke
their
age
,
and
other
furniture
of
very
little
worth
;
but
clean
and
neatly
kept
.
 
<EOS>
Reclining
in
an
easy
-
chair
before
the
fire
,
pale
and
weak
from
waste
of
blood
,
was
Edward
Chester
,
the
young
gentleman
who
had
been
the
first
to
quit
the
Maypole
on
the
previous
night
,
and
who
,
extending
his
hand
to
the
locksmith
,
welcomed
him
as
his
preserver
and
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
Say
no
more
,
sir
,
say
no
more
,
"
said
Gabriel
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
would
have
done
at
least
as
much
for
any
man
in
such
a
strait
,
and
most
of
all
for
you
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
A
certain
young
lady
,
"
he
added
,
with
some
hesitation
,
"
has
done
us
many
a
kind
turn
,
and
we
naturally
feel
---
I
hope
I
give
you
no
offence
in
saying
this
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
young
man
smiled
and
shook
his
head
;
at
the
same
time
moving
in
his
chair
as
if
in
pain
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
no
great
matter
,
"
he
said
,
in
answer
to
the
locksmith
's
sympathising
look
,
"
a
mere
uneasiness
arising
at
least
as
much
from
being
cooped
up
here
,
as
from
the
slight
wound
I
have
,
or
from
the
loss
of
blood
.
 
<EOS>
Be
seated
,
Mr
Varden
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
may
make
so
bold
,
Mr
Edward
,
as
to
lean
upon
your
chair
,
"
returned
the
locksmith
,
accommodating
his
action
to
his
speech
,
and
bending
over
him
,
"
<EOS>
I
'll
stand
here
for
the
convenience
of
speaking
low
.
 
<EOS>
Barnaby
is
not
in
his
quietest
humour
to
-
night
,
and
at
such
times
talking
never
does
him
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
both
glanced
at
the
subject
of
this
remark
,
who
had
taken
a
seat
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
,
and
,
smiling
vacantly
,
was
making
puzzles
on
his
fingers
with
a
skein
of
string
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
tell
me
,
sir
,
"
said
Varden
,
dropping
his
voice
still
lower
,
"
exactly
what
happened
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
my
reason
for
inquiring
.
<EOS>
You
left
the
Maypole
,
alone
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
walked
homeward
alone
,
until
I
had
nearly
reached
the
place
where
you
found
me
,
when
I
heard
the
gallop
of
a
horse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Behind
you
?
"
said
the
locksmith
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
yes
---
behind
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
single
rider
,
who
soon
overtook
me
,
and
checking
his
horse
,
inquired
the
way
to
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
were
on
the
alert
,
sir
,
knowing
how
many
highwaymen
there
are
,
scouring
the
roads
in
all
directions
?
"
said
Varden
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
,
but
I
had
only
a
stick
,
having
imprudently
left
my
pistols
in
their
holster
-
case
with
the
landlord
's
son
.
 
<EOS>
I
directed
him
as
he
desired
.
 
<EOS>
Before
the
words
had
passed
my
lips
,
he
rode
upon
me
furiously
,
as
if
bent
on
trampling
me
down
beneath
his
horse
's
hoofs
.
 
<EOS>
In
starting
aside
,
I
slipped
and
fell
.
 
<EOS>
You
found
me
with
this
stab
and
an
ugly
bruise
or
two
,
and
without
my
purse
---
in
which
he
found
little
enough
for
his
pains
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
,
Mr
Varden
,
"
he
added
,
shaking
the
locksmith
by
the
hand
,
"
saving
the
extent
of
my
gratitude
to
you
,
you
know
as
much
as
I.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Except
,
"
said
Gabriel
,
bending
down
yet
more
,
and
looking
cautiously
towards
their
silent
neighhour
,
"
except
in
respect
of
the
robber
himself
.
 
<EOS>
What
like
was
he
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
Speak
low
,
if
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
Barnaby
means
no
harm
,
but
I
have
watched
him
oftener
than
you
,
and
I
know
,
little
as
you
would
think
it
,
that
he
's
listening
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
required
a
strong
confidence
in
the
locksmith
's
veracity
to
lead
any
one
to
this
belief
,
for
every
sense
and
faculty
that
Barnahy
possessed
,
seemed
to
be
fixed
upon
his
game
,
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
things
.
 
<EOS>
Something
in
the
young
man
's
face
expressed
this
opinion
,
for
Gabriel
repeated
what
he
had
just
said
,
more
earnestly
than
before
,
and
with
another
glance
towards
Barnaby
,
again
asked
what
like
the
man
was
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
night
was
so
dark
,
"
said
Edward
,
"
the
attack
so
sudden
,
and
he
so
wrapped
and
muffled
up
,
that
I
can
hardly
say
.
 
<EOS>
It
seems
that
---
"
  
"
Do
n't
mention
his
name
,
sir
,
"
returned
the
locksmith
,
following
his
look
towards
Barnaby
;
"
I
know
HE
saw
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
know
what
YOU
saw
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
I
remember
is
,
"
said
Edward
,
"
that
as
he
checked
his
horse
his
hat
was
blown
off
.
 
<EOS>
He
caught
it
,
and
replaced
it
on
his
head
,
which
I
observed
was
bound
with
a
dark
handkerchief
.
 
<EOS>
A
stranger
entered
the
Maypole
while
I
was
there
,
whom
I
had
not
seen
---
<EOS>
for
I
had
sat
apart
for
reasons
of
my
own
---
and
when
I
rose
to
leave
the
room
and
glanced
round
,
he
was
in
the
shadow
of
the
chimney
and
hidden
from
my
sight
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
if
he
and
the
robber
were
two
different
persons
,
their
voices
were
strangely
and
most
remarkably
alike
;
for
directly
the
man
addressed
me
in
the
road
,
I
recognised
his
speech
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
as
I
feared
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
man
was
here
to
-
night
,
"
thought
the
locksmith
,
changing
colour
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
dark
history
is
this
!
"
  
"
<EOS>
Halloa
!
"
cried
a
hoarse
voice
in
his
ear
.
 
<EOS>
"
Halloa
,
halloa
,
halloa
!
 
<EOS>
Bow
<EOS>
wow
<EOS>
wow
.
 
<EOS>
What
's
the
matter
here
!
 
<EOS>
Hal
-
loa
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
speaker
---
who
made
the
locksmith
start
as
if
he
had
been
some
supernatural
agent
---
was
a
large
raven
,
who
had
perched
upon
the
top
of
the
easy
-
chair
,
unseen
by
him
and
Edward
,
and
listened
with
a
polite
attention
and
a
most
extraordinary
appearance
of
comprehending
every
word
,
to
all
they
had
said
up
to
this
point
;
turning
his
head
from
one
to
the
other
,
as
if
his
office
were
to
judge
between
them
,
and
it
were
of
the
very
last
importance
that
he
should
not
lose
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
at
him
!
"
<EOS>
said
Varden
,
divided
between
admiration
of
the
bird
and
a
kind
of
fear
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Was
there
ever
such
a
knowing
imp
as
that
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
he
's
a
dreadful
fellow
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
raven
,
with
his
head
very
much
on
one
side
,
and
his
bright
eye
shining
like
a
diamond
,
preserved
a
thoughtful
silence
for
a
few
seconds
,
and
then
replied
in
a
voice
so
hoarse
and
distant
,
that
it
seemed
to
come
through
his
thick
feathers
rather
than
out
of
his
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
"
Halloa
,
halloa
,
halloa
!
 
<EOS>
What
's
the
matter
here
!
 
<EOS>
Keep
up
your
spirits
.
 
<EOS>
Never
say
die
.
 
<EOS>
Bow
<EOS>
wow
<EOS>
wow
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
a
devil
<EOS>
,
I
'm
a
devil
,
I
'm
a
devil
.
 
<EOS>
Hurrah
!
"
<EOS>
---
And
then
,
as
if
exulting
in
his
infernal
character
,
he
began
to
whistle
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
more
than
half
believe
he
speaks
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
I
do
,
"
said
Varden
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
see
how
he
looks
at
me
,
as
if
he
knew
what
I
was
saying
?
"
  
<EOS>
To
which
the
bird
,
balancing
himself
on
tiptoe
,
as
it
were
,
and
moving
his
body
up
and
down
in
a
sort
of
grave
dance
,
rejoined
,
"
I
'm
a
devil
,
I
'm
a
devil
,
I
'm
a
devil
,
"
and
flapped
his
wings
against
his
sides
as
if
he
were
bursting
with
laughter
.
 
<EOS>
Barnaby
clapped
his
hands
,
and
fairly
rolled
upon
the
ground
in
an
ecstasy
of
delight
.
  
<EOS>
"
Strange
companions
,
sir
,
"
said
the
locksmith
,
shaking
his
head
,
and
looking
from
one
to
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
bird
has
all
the
wit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Strange
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
said
Edward
,
holding
out
his
forefinger
to
the
raven
,
who
,
in
acknowledgment
of
the
attention
,
made
a
dive
at
it
immediately
with
his
iron
bill
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
he
old
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
mere
boy
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
locksmith
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
hundred
and
twenty
,
or
thereabouts
.
 
<EOS>
Call
him
down
,
Barnaby
,
my
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Call
him
!
"
echoed
Barnaby
,
sitting
upright
upon
the
floor
,
and
staring
vacantly
at
Gabriel
,
as
he
thrust
his
hair
back
from
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
who
can
make
him
come
!
 
<EOS>
He
calls
me
,
and
makes
me
go
where
he
will
.
 
<EOS>
He
goes
on
before
,
and
I
follow
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
the
master
,
and
I
'm
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
Is
that
the
truth
,
Grip
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
raven
gave
a
short
,
comfortable
,
confidential
kind
of
croak
;
---
a
most
expressive
croak
,
which
seemed
to
say
,
"
You
need
n't
let
these
fellows
into
our
secrets
.
 
<EOS>
We
understand
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
all
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
make
HIM
come
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Barnaby
,
pointing
to
the
bird
.
 
<EOS>
"
Him
,
who
never
goes
to
sleep
,
or
so
much
as
winks
!
---
Why
,
any
time
of
night
,
you
may
see
his
eyes
in
my
dark
room
,
shining
like
two
sparks
.
 
<EOS>
And
every
night
,
and
all
night
too
,
he
's
broad
awake
,
talking
to
himself
,
thinking
what
he
shall
do
to
-
morrow
,
where
we
shall
go
,
and
what
he
shall
steal
,
and
hide
,
and
bury
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
HIM
come
!
<EOS>
Ha
ha
ha
!
"
  
<EOS>
On
second
thoughts
,
the
bird
appeared
disposed
to
come
of
himself
.
<EOS>
After
a
short
survey
of
the
ground
,
and
a
few
sidelong
looks
at
the
ceiling
and
at
everybody
present
in
turn
,
he
fluttered
to
the
floor
,
and
went
to
Barnaby
---
not
in
a
hop
,
or
walk
,
or
run
,
but
in
a
pace
like
that
of
a
very
particular
gentleman
with
exceedingly
tight
boots
on
,
trying
to
walk
fast
over
loose
pebbles
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
stepping
into
his
extended
hand
,
and
condescending
to
be
held
out
at
arm
's
length
,
he
gave
vent
to
a
succession
of
sounds
,
not
unlike
the
drawing
of
some
eight
or
ten
dozen
of
long
corks
,
and
again
asserted
his
brimstone
birth
and
parentage
with
great
distinctness
.
  
<EOS>
The
locksmith
shook
his
head
---
perhaps
in
some
doubt
of
the
creature
's
being
really
nothing
but
a
bird
---
perhaps
in
pity
for
Bamaby
,
who
by
this
time
had
him
in
his
arms
,
and
was
rolling
about
,
with
him
,
on
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
raised
his
eyes
from
the
poor
fellow
he
encountered
those
of
his
mother
,
who
had
entered
the
room
,
and
was
looking
on
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
quite
white
in
the
face
,
even
to
her
lips
,
but
had
wholly
subdued
her
emotion
,
and
wore
her
usual
quiet
look
.
 
<EOS>
Varden
fancied
as
he
glanced
at
her
that
she
shrunk
from
his
eye
;
and
that
she
busied
herself
about
the
wounded
gentleman
to
avoid
him
the
better
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
time
he
went
to
bed
,
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
to
be
removed
to
his
own
home
on
the
morrow
,
and
he
had
already
exceeded
his
time
for
sitting
up
,
by
a
full
hour
.
 
<EOS>
Acting
on
this
hint
,
the
locksmith
prepared
to
take
his
leave
.
  
<EOS>
"
By
the
bye
,
"
said
Edward
,
as
he
shook
him
by
the
hand
,
and
looked
from
him
to
Mrs
Rudge
and
back
again
,
"
what
noise
was
that
below
?
<EOS>
I
heard
your
voice
in
the
midst
of
it
,
and
should
have
inquired
before
,
but
our
other
conversation
drove
it
from
my
memory
.
 
<EOS>
What
was
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
locksmith
looked
towards
her
,
and
bit
his
lip
.
 
<EOS>
She
leant
against
the
chair
,
and
bent
her
eyes
upon
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
Barnaby
too
---
 
<EOS>
he
was
listening
.
   
<EOS>
---
"
Some
mad
or
drunken
fellow
,
sir
,
"
Varden
at
length
made
answer
,
<EOS>
looking
steadily
at
the
widow
as
he
spoke
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
mistook
the
house
,
and
tried
to
force
an
entrance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
breathed
more
freely
,
but
stood
quite
motionless
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
locksmith
said
"
Good
night
,
"
and
Barnaby
caught
up
the
candle
to
light
him
down
the
stairs
,
she
took
it
from
him
,
and
charged
him
---
 
with
more
haste
and
earnestness
than
so
slight
an
occasion
appeared
to
warrant
---
not
to
stir
.
 
<EOS>
The
raven
followed
them
to
satisfy
himself
that
all
was
right
below
,
and
when
they
reached
the
street
-
door
,
stood
on
the
bottom
stair
drawing
corks
out
of
number
.
  
<EOS>
With
a
trembling
hand
she
unfastened
the
chain
and
bolts
,
and
turned
the
key
.
 
<EOS>
As
she
had
her
hand
upon
the
latch
,
the
locksmith
said
in
a
low
voice
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
told
a
lie
to
-
night
,
for
your
sake
,
Mary
,
and
for
the
sake
of
bygone
times
and
old
acquaintance
,
when
I
would
scorn
to
do
so
for
my
own
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
may
have
done
no
harm
,
or
led
to
none
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
help
the
suspicions
you
have
forced
upon
me
,
and
I
am
loth
,
I
tell
you
plainly
,
to
leave
Mr
Edward
here
.
 
<EOS>
Take
care
<EOS>
he
comes
to
no
hurt
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
the
safety
of
this
roof
,
and
am
glad
he
leaves
it
so
soon
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
let
me
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
For
a
moment
she
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
and
wept
;
but
resisting
the
strong
impulse
which
evidently
moved
her
to
reply
,
opened
the
door
---
no
wider
than
was
sufficient
for
the
passage
of
his
body
---
 
and
motioned
him
away
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
locksmith
stood
upon
the
step
,
it
was
chained
and
locked
behind
him
,
and
the
raven
,
in
furtherance
of
these
precautions
,
barked
like
a
lusty
house
-
dog
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
league
with
that
ill
-
looking
figure
that
might
have
fallen
from
a
gibbet
---
he
listening
and
hiding
here
---
Barnaby
first
upon
the
spot
last
night
---
can
she
who
has
always
borne
so
fair
<EOS>
a
name
be
guilty
of
such
crimes
in
secret
!
"
said
the
locksmith
,
musing
.
 
<EOS>
"
Heaven
forgive
me
if
I
am
wrong
,
and
send
me
just
thoughts
;
but
she
is
poor
,
the
temptation
may
be
great
,
and
we
daily
hear
of
things
as
strange
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Ay
,
bark
away
,
my
friend
.
 
<EOS>
If
there
's
any
wickedness
going
on
,
that
raven
's
in
it
,
I
'll
be
sworn
.

Chapter
07
    
Mrs
Varden
was
a
lady
of
what
is
commonly
called
an
uncertain
temper
---
a
phrase
which
being
interpreted
signifies
a
temper
tolerably
certain
to
make
everybody
more
or
less
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
Thus
it
generally
happened
,
that
when
other
people
were
merry
,
Mrs
Varden
was
dull
;
and
that
when
other
people
were
dull
,
Mrs
Varden
was
disposed
to
be
amazingly
cheerful
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
the
worthy
housewife
was
of
such
a
capricious
nature
,
that
she
not
only
attained
a
higher
pitch
of
genius
than
Macbeth
,
in
respect
of
her
ability
to
be
wise
,
amazed
,
temperate
and
furious
,
loyal
and
neutral
in
an
instant
,
but
would
sometimes
ring
the
changes
backwards
and
forwards
on
all
possible
moods
and
flights
in
one
short
quarter
of
an
hour
;
performing
,
as
it
were
,
a
kind
of
triple
bob
major
on
the
peal
of
instruments
in
the
female
belfry
,
with
a
skilfulness
and
rapidity
of
execution
that
astonished
all
who
heard
her
.
  
<EOS>
It
had
been
observed
in
this
good
lady
(
who
did
not
want
for
personal
attractions
,
being
plump
and
buxom
to
look
at
,
though
like
her
fair
daughter
,
somewhat
short
in
stature
)
that
this
uncertainty
of
disposition
strengthened
and
increased
with
her
temporal
prosperity
;
and
divers
wise
men
and
matrons
,
on
friendly
terms
with
the
locksmith
and
his
family
,
even
went
so
far
as
to
assert
,
that
a
tumble
down
some
half
-
dozen
rounds
in
the
world
's
ladder
---
such
as
the
breaking
of
the
bank
in
which
her
husband
kept
his
money
,
or
some
little
fall
of
that
kind
---
would
be
the
making
of
her
,
and
could
hardly
fail
to
render
her
one
of
the
most
agreeable
companions
in
existence
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
they
were
right
or
wrong
in
this
conjecture
,
certain
it
is
that
minds
,
like
bodies
,
will
often
fall
into
a
pimpled
ill
-
conditioned
state
from
mere
excess
of
comfort
,
and
like
them
,
are
often
successfully
cured
by
remedies
in
themselves
very
nauseous
and
unpalatable
.

Mrs
Varden
's
chief
aider
and
abettor
,
and
at
the
same
time
her
principal
victim
and
object
of
wrath
,
was
her
single
domestic
servant
,
one
Miss
Miggs
;
or
as
she
was
called
,
in
conformity
with
those
prejudices
of
society
which
lop
and
top
from
poor
hand
-
maidens
<EOS>
all
such
genteel
excrescences
---
Miggs
.
 
<EOS>
This
Miggs
was
a
tall
young
lady
,
very
much
addicted
to
pattens
in
private
life
;
slender
and
shrewish
,
of
a
rather
uncomfortable
figure
,
and
though
not
absolutely
ill
-
looking
,
of
a
sharp
and
acid
visage
.
 
<EOS>
As
a
general
principle
and
abstract
proposition
,
Miggs
held
the
male
sex
to
be
utterly
contemptible
and
unworthy
of
notice
;
to
be
fickle
,
false
,
base
,
sottish
,
inclined
to
perjury
,
and
wholly
undeserving
.
<EOS>
When
particularly
exasperated
against
them
(
which
,
scandal
said
,
was
when
Sim
Tappertit
slighted
her
most
)
<EOS>
she
was
accustomed
to
wish
with
great
emphasis
that
the
whole
race
of
women
could
but
die
off
,
in
order
that
the
men
might
be
brought
to
know
the
real
value
of
the
blessings
by
which
they
set
so
little
store
;
nay
,
her
feeling
for
her
order
ran
so
high
,
that
she
sometimes
declared
,
if
she
could
only
have
good
security
for
a
fair
,
round
number
---
say
ten
thousand
---
of
young
virgins
following
her
example
,
she
would
,
to
spite
mankind
,
hang
,
drown
,
stab
,
or
poison
herself
,
with
a
joy
past
all
expression
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
voice
of
Miggs
that
greeted
the
locksmith
,
when
he
knocked
at
his
own
house
,
with
a
shrill
cry
of
"
Who
's
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Me
,
girl
,
me
,
"
returned
Gabriel
.
  
<EOS>
What
,
already
,
sir
!
"
said
Miggs
,
opening
the
door
with
a
look
of
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
were
just
getting
on
our
nightcaps
to
sit
up
,
---
me
and
mistress
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
she
has
been
SO
bad
!
"
  
<EOS>
Miggs
said
this
with
an
air
of
uncommon
candour
and
concern
;
but
the
parlour
-
door
was
standing
open
,
and
as
Gabriel
very
well
knew
for
whose
ears
it
was
designed
,
he
regarded
her
with
anything
but
an
approving
look
as
he
passed
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
Master
's
come
home
,
mim
,
"
cried
Miggs
,
running
before
him
into
the
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
was
wrong
,
mim
,
and
I
was
right
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
he
would
n't
keep
us
up
so
late
,
two
nights
running
,
mim
.
 
<EOS>
Master
's
always
considerate
so
far
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
so
glad
,
mim
,
on
your
account
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
a
little
"
<EOS>
---
here
Miggs
simpered
---
"
a
little
sleepy
myself
;
I
'll
own
it
now
,
mim
,
though
I
said
I
was
n't
when
you
asked
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
ai
n't
of
no
consequence
,
mim
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
,
"
said
the
locksmith
,
who
most
devoutly
wished
that
Barnaby
's
raven
was
at
Miggs
's
ankles
,
"
you
had
better
get
to
bed
at
once
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thanking
you
kindly
,
sir
,
"
returned
Miggs
,
"
I
could
n't
take
my
rest
in
peace
,
nor
fix
my
thoughts
upon
my
prayers
,
otherways
than
that
I
knew
mistress
was
comfortable
in
her
bed
this
night
;
<EOS>
by
rights
she
ought
to
have
been
there
,
hours
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
talkative
,
mistress
,
"
said
Varden
,
pulling
off
his
greatcoat
,
and
looking
at
her
askew
.
  
<EOS>
"
Taking
the
hint
,
sir
,
"
cried
Miggs
,
with
a
flushed
face
,
"
and
thanking
you
for
it
most
kindly
,
I
will
make
bold
to
say
,
that
if
I
give
offence
by
having
consideration
for
my
mistress
,
I
do
not
ask
your
pardon
,
but
am
content
to
get
myself
into
trouble
and
to
be
in
suffering
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Here
<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
,
who
,
with
her
countenance
shrouded
in
a
large
nightcap
,
had
been
all
this
time
intent
upon
the
Protestant
Manual
,
looked
round
,
and
acknowledged
Miggs
's
championship
by
commanding
her
to
hold
her
tongue
.
  
<EOS>
Every
little
bone
in
Miggs
's
throat
and
neck
developed
itself
with
a
spitefulness
quite
alarming
,
as
she
replied
,
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
mim
,
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
find
yourself
now
,
my
dear
?
"
said
the
locksmith
,
taking
a
chair
near
his
wife
(
who
had
resumed
her
book
)
,
and
rubbing
his
knees
hard
as
he
made
the
inquiry
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
very
anxious
to
know
,
an't
you
?
"
returned
Mrs
Varden
,
with
her
eyes
upon
the
print
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
,
that
have
not
been
near
me
all
day
,
and
would
n't
have
been
if
I
was
dying
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Martha
---
"
said
Gabriel
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
turned
over
to
the
next
page
;
then
went
back
again
to
the
bottom
line
over
leaf
to
be
quite
sure
of
the
last
words
;
and
then
went
on
reading
with
an
appearance
of
the
deepest
interest
and
study
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Martha
,
"
said
the
locksmith
,
"
how
can
you
say
such
things
,
when
you
know
you
do
n't
mean
them
?
 
<EOS>
If
you
were
dying
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
if
there
was
anything
serious
the
matter
with
you
,
Martha
,
should
n't
I
be
in
constant
attendance
upon
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
!
"
cried
Mrs
Varden
,
bursting
into
tears
,
"
yes
,
you
would
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
doubt
it
,
Varden
.
 
<EOS>
Certainly
you
would
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
as
much
as
to
tell
me
that
you
would
be
hovering
round
me
like
a
vulture
,
waiting
till
the
breath
was
out
of
my
body
,
that
you
might
go
and
marry
somebody
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miggs
groaned
in
sympathy
---
a
little
short
groan
,
checked
in
its
birth
,
and
changed
into
a
cough
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
say
,
"
I
ca
n't
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
wrung
from
me
by
the
dreadful
brutality
of
that
monster
master
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
'll
break
my
heart
one
of
these
days
,
"
added
Mrs
Varden
,
with
more
resignation
,
"
and
then
we
shall
both
be
happy
.
 
<EOS>
My
only
desire
is
to
see
Dolly
comfortably
settled
,
and
when
she
is
,
you
may
settle
ME
as
soon
as
you
like
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Miggs
---
and
coughed
again
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Gabriel
twisted
his
wig
about
in
silence
for
a
long
time
,
and
then
said
mildly
,
"
Has
Dolly
gone
to
bed
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
master
speaks
to
you
,
"
said
Mrs
Varden
,
looking
sternly
over
her
shoulder
at
Miss
Miggs
in
waiting
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
dear
,
I
spoke
to
you
,
"
suggested
the
locksmith
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
hear
me
,
Miggs
?
"
cried
the
obdurate
lady
,
stamping
her
foot
upon
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
"
YOU
are
beginning
to
despise
me
now
,
are
you
?
 
<EOS>
But
this
is
example
!
"
  
<EOS>
At
this
cruel
rebuke
,
Miggs
,
whose
tears
were
always
ready
,
for
large
or
small
parties
,
on
the
shortest
notice
and
the
most
reasonable
terms
,
fell
a
crying
violently
;
holding
both
her
hands
tight
upon
her
heart
meanwhile
,
as
if
nothing
less
would
prevent
its
splitting
into
small
fragments
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
,
who
likewise
possessed
that
faculty
in
high
perfection
,
wept
too
,
against
Miggs
;
and
with
such
effect
that
Miggs
gave
in
after
a
time
,
and
,
except
for
an
occasional
sob
,
which
seemed
to
threaten
some
remote
intention
of
breaking
out
again
,
left
her
mistress
in
possession
of
the
field
.
 
<EOS>
Her
superiority
being
thoroughly
asserted
,
that
lady
soon
desisted
likewise
,
and
fell
into
a
quiet
melancholy
.
  
<EOS>
The
relief
was
so
great
,
and
the
fatiguing
occurrences
of
last
night
so
completely
overpowered
the
locksmith
,
that
he
nodded
in
his
chair
,
and
would
doubtless
have
slept
there
all
night
,
but
for
the
voice
of
Mrs
Varden
,
which
,
after
a
pause
of
some
five
minutes
,
awoke
him
with
a
start
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
am
ever
,
"
said
Mrs
V
---
not
scolding
,
but
in
a
sort
of
monotonous
remonstrance
---
"
in
spirits
,
<EOS>
if
I
am
ever
cheerful
,
if
I
am
ever
more
than
usually
disposed
to
be
talkative
and
comfortable
,
this
is
the
way
I
am
treated
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Such
spirits
as
you
was
in
too
,
mim
,
but
half
an
hour
ago
!
"
cried
Miggs
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
see
such
company
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
,
"
said
Mrs
Varden
,
"
because
I
never
interfere
or
interrupt
;
because
I
never
question
where
anybody
comes
or
goes
;
because
my
whole
mind
and
soul
is
bent
on
saving
where
I
can
save
,
and
labouring
in
this
house
;
---
therefore
,
they
try
me
as
they
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Martha
,
"
urged
the
locksmith
,
endeavouring
to
look
as
wakeful
as
possible
,
"
what
is
it
you
complain
of
?
 
<EOS>
I
really
came
home
with
every
wish
and
desire
to
be
happy
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
I
complain
of
!
"
<EOS>
retorted
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
it
a
chilling
thing
to
have
one
's
husband
sulking
and
falling
asleep
<EOS>
directly
he
comes
home
---
to
have
him
freezing
all
one
's
warm
-
heartedness
,
and
throwing
cold
water
over
the
fireside
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
natural
,
when
I
know
he
went
out
upon
a
matter
in
which
I
am
as
much
interested
as
anybody
can
be
,
that
I
should
wish
to
know
all
that
has
happened
,
or
that
he
should
tell
me
without
my
begging
and
praying
him
to
do
it
?
 
<EOS>
Is
that
natural
,
or
is
it
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
sorry
,
Martha
,
"
said
the
good
-
natured
locksmith
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
really
afraid
you
were
not
disposed
to
talk
pleasantly
;
I
'll
tell
you
everything
;
I
shall
only
be
too
glad
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Varden
,
"
returned
his
wife
,
rising
with
dignity
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
---
 
<EOS>
thank
you
!
 
<EOS>
I
'm
not
a
child
to
be
corrected
one
minute
and
petted
the
next
---
I
'm
a
little
too
old
for
that
,
Varden
.
 
<EOS>
Miggs
,
carry
the
light
.
<EOS>
---
YOU
can
be
cheerful
,
Miggs
,
<EOS>
at
least
"
  
Miggs
,
who
,
to
this
moment
,
had
been
in
the
very
depths
of
compassionate
despondency
,
passed
instantly
into
the
liveliest
state
conceivable
,
and
tossing
her
head
as
she
glanced
towards
the
locksmith
,
bore
off
her
mistress
and
the
light
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
who
would
think
,
"
thought
Varden
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
drawing
his
chair
nearer
to
the
fire
,
"
that
that
woman
could
ever
be
pleasant
and
agreeable
?
 
<EOS>
And
yet
she
can
be
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
all
of
us
have
our
faults
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
not
be
hard
upon
hers
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
been
man
and
wife
too
long
for
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
dozed
again
---
not
the
less
pleasantly
,
perhaps
,
for
his
hearty
temper
.
 
<EOS>
While
his
eyes
were
closed
,
the
door
leading
to
the
upper
stairs
was
partially
opened
;
and
a
head
appeared
,
which
,
at
sight
of
him
,
hastily
drew
back
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
,
"
murmured
Gabriel
,
waking
at
the
noise
,
and
looking
round
the
room
,
"
I
wish
somebody
would
marry
Miggs
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
's
impossible
!
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
there
's
any
madman
alive
,
who
would
marry
Miggs
!
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
such
a
vast
speculation
that
he
fell
into
a
doze
again
,
and
slept
until
the
fire
was
quite
burnt
out
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
he
roused
himself
;
and
having
double
-
locked
the
street
-
door
according
to
custom
,
and
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
,
went
off
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
not
left
the
room
in
darkness
many
minutes
,
when
the
head
again
appeared
,
and
Sim
Tappertit
entered
,
bearing
in
his
hand
a
little
lamp
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
the
devil
business
has
he
to
stop
up
so
late
!
"
muttered
Sim
,
passing
into
the
workshop
,
and
setting
it
down
upon
the
forge
.
"
<EOS>
Here
's
half
the
night
gone
already
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
only
one
good
that
has
ever
come
to
me
,
out
of
this
cursed
old
rusty
mechanical
trade
,
and
that
's
this
piece
of
ironmongery
,
upon
my
soul
!
"
  
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
he
drew
from
the
right
hand
,
or
rather
right
leg
pocket
of
his
smalls
,
a
clumsy
large
-
sized
key
,
which
he
inserted
cautiously
in
the
lock
his
master
had
secured
,
and
softly
opened
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
That
done
,
he
replaced
his
piece
of
secret
workmanship
in
his
pocket
;
and
leaving
the
lamp
burning
,
and
closing
the
door
carefully
and
without
noise
,
stole
out
into
the
street
---
as
little
suspected
by
the
locksmith
in
his
sound
deep
sleep
,
as
by

Chapter
08
    
Clear
of
the
locksmith
's
house
<EOS>
,
Sim
Tappertit
laid
aside
his
cautious
manner
,
and
assuming
in
its
stead
that
of
a
ruffling
,
swaggering
,
roving
blade
,
who
would
rather
kill
a
man
than
otherwise
,
and
eat
him
too
if
needful
,
made
the
best
of
his
way
along
the
darkened
streets
.
  
<EOS>
Half
pausing
for
an
instant
now
and
then
to
smite
his
pocket
and
assure
himself
of
the
safety
of
his
master
key
,
he
hurried
on
to
Barbican
,
and
turning
into
one
of
the
narrowest
of
the
narrow
streets
which
diverged
from
that
centre
,
slackened
his
pace
and
wiped
his
heated
brow
,
as
if
the
termination
of
his
walk
were
near
at
hand
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
a
very
choice
spot
for
midnight
expeditions
,
being
in
truth
one
of
more
than
questionable
character
,
and
of
an
appearance
by
no
means
inviting
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
main
street
he
had
entered
,
itself
little
better
than
an
alley
,
a
low
-
browed
doorway
led
into
a
blind
court
,
or
yard
,
profoundly
dark
,
unpaved
,
and
reeking
with
stagnant
odours
.
 
<EOS>
Into
this
ill
-
favoured
pit
,
the
locksmith
's
vagrant
'
prentice
groped
his
way
;
and
stopping
at
a
house
from
whose
defaced
and
rotten
front
the
rude
effigy
of
a
bottle
swung
to
and
fro
like
some
gibbeted
malefactor
,
struck
thrice
upon
an
iron
grating
with
his
foot
.
 
<EOS>
After
listening
in
vain
for
some
response
to
his
signal
,
Mr
Tappertit
became
impatient
,
and
struck
the
grating
thrice
again
.
  
<EOS>
A
further
delay
ensued
,
but
it
was
not
of
long
duration
.
 
<EOS>
The
ground
seemed
to
open
at
his
feet
,
and
a
ragged
head
appeared
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
the
captain
?
"
said
a
voice
as
ragged
as
the
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
replied
Mr
Tappertit
haughtily
,
descending
as
he
spoke
,
"
who
should
it
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
so
late
,
we
gave
you
up
,
"
returned
the
voice
,
as
its
owner
stopped
to
shut
and
fasten
the
grating
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
late
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lead
on
,
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
,
with
a
gloomy
majesty
,
"
and
make
remarks
when
I
require
you
.
 
<EOS>
Forward
!
"
  
<EOS>
This
latter
word
of
command
was
perhaps
somewhat
theatrical
and
unnecessary
,
inasmuch
as
the
descent
was
by
a
very
narrow
,
steep
,
and
slippery
flight
of
steps
,
and
any
rashness
or
departure
from
the
beaten
track
must
have
ended
in
a
yawning
water
-
butt
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mr
Tappertit
being
,
like
some
other
great
commanders
,
favourable
to
strong
effects
,
and
personal
display
,
cried
"
Forward
!
"
<EOS>
again
,
in
the
hoarsest
voice
he
could
assume
;
and
led
the
way
,
with
folded
arms
and
knitted
brows
,
to
the
cellar
down
below
,
where
there
was
a
small
copper
fixed
in
one
corner
,
a
chair
or
two
,
a
form
and
table
,
a
glimmering
fire
,
and
a
truckle
-
bed
,
covered
with
a
ragged
patchwork
rug
.
  
<EOS>
"
Welcome
,
noble
captain
!
"
cried
a
lanky
figure
,
rising
as
from
a
nap
.
  
<EOS>
The
captain
nodded
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
throwing
off
his
outer
coat
,
he
stood
composed
in
all
his
dignity
,
and
eyed
his
follower
over
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
news
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
,
when
he
had
looked
into
his
very
soul
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
particular
,
"
replied
the
other
,
stretching
himself
---
and
he
was
so
long
already
that
it
was
quite
alarming
to
see
him
do
it
<EOS>
---
 
<EOS>
"
how
come
you
to
be
so
late
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
matter
,
"
was
all
the
captain
deigned
to
say
in
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
the
room
prepared
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
"
replied
the
follower
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
comrade
---
is
he
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
And
a
sprinkling
of
the
others
---
you
hear
'
em
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Playing
skittles
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
captain
moodily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Light
-
hearted
revellers
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
doubt
respecting
the
particular
amusement
in
which
these
heedless
spirits
were
indulging
,
for
even
in
the
close
and
stifling
atmosphere
of
the
vault
,
the
noise
sounded
like
distant
thunder
.
 
<EOS>
It
certainly
appeared
,
at
first
sight
,
a
singular
spot
to
choose
,
for
that
or
any
other
purpose
of
relaxation
,
if
the
other
cellars
answered
to
the
one
in
which
this
brief
colloquy
took
place
;
for
the
floors
were
of
sodden
earth
,
the
walls
and
roof
of
damp
bare
brick
tapestried
with
the
tracks
of
snails
and
slugs
;
the
air
was
sickening
,
tainted
,
and
offensive
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
,
from
one
strong
flavour
which
was
uppermost
among
the
various
odours
of
the
place
,
that
it
had
,
at
no
very
distant
period
,
been
used
as
a
storehouse
for
cheeses
;
a
circumstance
which
,
while
it
accounted
for
the
greasy
moisture
that
hung
about
it
,
was
agreeably
suggestive
of
rats
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
naturally
damp
besides
,
and
little
trees
of
fungus
sprung
from
every
mouldering
corner
.
  
<EOS>
The
proprietor
of
this
charming
retreat
,
and
owner
of
the
ragged
head
before
mentioned
---
for
he
wore
an
old
tie
-
wig
as
bare
and
frowzy
as
a
stunted
hearth
-
broom
---
had
by
this
time
joined
them
;
and
stood
a
little
apart
,
rubbing
his
hands
,
wagging
his
hoary
bristled
chin
,
and
smiling
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
closed
;
but
had
they
been
wide
open
,
it
would
have
been
easy
to
tell
,
from
the
attentive
expression
of
the
face
he
turned
towards
them
---
pale
and
unwholesome
as
might
be
expected
in
one
of
his
underground
existence
---
and
from
a
certain
anxious
raising
and
quivering
of
the
lids
,
that
he
was
blind
.
  
<EOS>
"
Even
Stagg
hath
been
asleep
,
"
said
the
long
comrade
,
nodding
towards
this
person
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sound
,
captain
,
sound
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
blind
man
;
"
what
does
my
noble
captain
drink
---
is
it
brandy
,
rum
,
usquebaugh
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
soaked
gunpowder
,
or
blazing
oil
?
 
<EOS>
Give
it
a
name
,
heart
of
oak
,
and
we
'd
get
it
for
you
,
if
it
was
wine
from
a
bishop
's
cellar
,
or
melted
gold
from
King
George
's
mint
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
See
,
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
haughtily
,
"
that
it
's
something
strong
,
and
comes
quick
;
and
so
long
as
you
take
care
of
that
,
you
may
bring
it
from
the
devil
's
cellar
,
if
you
like
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Boldly
said
,
noble
captain
!
"
rejoined
the
blind
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Spoken
like
the
'
Prentices
'
Glory
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
From
the
devil
's
cellar
!
 
<EOS>
A
brave
joke
!
 
<EOS>
The
captain
joketh
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
"
  
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
my
fine
feller
,
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
,
eyeing
the
host
over
as
he
walked
to
a
closet
,
and
took
out
a
bottle
and
glass
as
carelessly
as
if
he
had
been
in
full
possession
of
his
sight
,
"
<EOS>
if
you
make
that
row
,
you
'll
find
that
the
captain
's
very
far
from
joking
,
and
so
I
tell
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
got
his
eyes
on
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Stagg
,
stopping
short
on
his
way
back
,
and
affecting
to
screen
his
face
with
the
bottle
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
feel
'em
though
I
ca
n't
see
'em
.
 
<EOS>
Take
'em
off
,
noble
captain
.
 
<EOS>
Remove
'em
,
for
they
pierce
like
gimlets
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Tappertit
smiled
grimly
at
his
comrade
;
and
twisting
out
one
more
look
---
a
kind
of
ocular
screw
---
under
the
influence
of
which
the
blind
man
feigned
to
undergo
great
anguish
and
torture
,
bade
him
,
in
a
softened
tone
,
approach
,
and
hold
his
peace
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
obey
you
,
captain
,
"
cried
Stagg
,
drawing
close
to
him
and
filling
out
a
bumper
without
spilling
a
drop
,
by
reason
that
he
held
his
little
finger
at
the
brim
of
the
glass
,
and
stopped
at
the
instant
the
liquor
touched
it
,
"
drink
,
noble
governor
.
 
<EOS>
Death
to
all
masters
,
life
to
all
'
prentices
,
and
love
to
all
fair
damsels
.
<EOS>
Drink
,
brave
general
,
and
warm
your
gallant
heart
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Tappertit
condescended
to
take
the
glass
from
his
outstretched
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Stagg
then
dropped
on
one
knee
,
and
gently
smoothed
the
calves
of
his
legs
,
with
an
air
of
humble
admiration
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
I
had
but
eyes
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
"
to
behold
my
captain
's
symmetrical
proportions
!
 
<EOS>
That
I
had
<EOS>
but
eyes
,
to
look
upon
these
twin
invaders
of
domestic
peace
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Get
out
!
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
,
glancing
downward
at
his
favourite
limbs
.
 
<EOS>
"
Go
along
,
will
you
,
Stagg
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
I
touch
my
own
afterwards
,
"
cried
the
host
,
smiting
them
reproachfully
,
"
I
hate
'em
.
 
<EOS>
Comparatively
speaking
,
they
've
no
more
shape
than
wooden
legs
,
beside
these
models
of
my
noble
captain
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yours
!
"
exclaimed
Mr
Tappertit
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
should
think
not
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
talk
about
those
precious
old
toothpicks
in
the
same
breath
with
mine
;
that
's
rather
too
much
.
 
<EOS>
Here
.
 
<EOS>
Take
the
glass
.
 
<EOS>
Benjamin
.
<EOS>
Lead
on
.
 
<EOS>
To
business
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
he
folded
his
arms
again
;
and
frowning
with
a
sullen
majesty
,
passed
with
his
companion
through
a
little
door
at
the
upper
end
of
the
cellar
,
and
disappeared
;
leaving
Stagg
to
his
private
meditations
.
  
<EOS>
The
vault
they
entered
,
strewn
with
sawdust
and
dimly
lighted
,
was
between
the
outer
one
from
which
they
had
just
come
,
and
that
in
which
the
skittle
-
players
were
diverting
themselves
;
as
was
manifested
by
the
increased
noise
and
clamour
of
tongues
,
which
was
suddenly
stopped
,
however
,
and
replaced
by
a
dead
silence
,
at
a
signal
from
the
long
comrade
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
this
young
gentleman
,
going
to
a
little
cupboard
,
returned
with
a
thigh
-
bone
,
which
in
former
times
must
have
been
part
and
parcel
of
some
individual
at
least
as
long
as
himself
,
and
placed
the
same
in
the
hands
of
Mr
Tappertit
;
who
,
receiving
it
as
a
sceptre
and
staff
of
authority
,
cocked
his
three
-
cornered
hat
fiercely
on
the
top
of
his
head
,
and
mounted
a
large
table
,
whereon
a
chair
of
state
,
cheerfully
ornamented
with
a
couple
of
skulls
,
was
placed
ready
for
his
reception
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
no
sooner
assumed
this
position
,
than
another
young
gentleman
appeared
,
bearing
in
his
arms
a
huge
clasped
book
,
who
made
him
a
profound
obeisance
,
and
delivering
it
to
the
long
comrade
,
advanced
to
the
table
,
and
turning
his
back
upon
it
,
stood
there
Atlas
-
wise
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
the
long
comrade
got
upon
the
table
too
;
and
seating
himself
in
a
lower
chair
than
Mr
Tappertit
's
,
with
much
state
and
ceremony
,
placed
the
large
book
on
the
shoulders
of
their
mute
companion
as
deliberately
as
if
he
had
been
a
wooden
desk
,
and
prepared
to
make
entries
therein
with
a
pen
of
corresponding
size
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
long
comrade
had
made
these
preparations
,
he
looked
towards
Mr
Tappertit
;
and
Mr
Tappertit
,
flourishing
the
bone
,
knocked
nine
times
therewith
upon
one
of
the
skulls
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
ninth
stroke
,
a
third
young
gentleman
emerged
from
the
door
leading
to
the
skittle
ground
,
and
bowing
low
,
awaited
his
commands
.
  
<EOS>
"
'
Prentice
!
"
said
the
mighty
captain
,
"
who
waits
without
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
'
prentice
made
answer
that
a
stranger
was
in
attendance
,
who
claimed
admission
into
that
secret
society
of
'
Prentice
Knights
,
and
a
free
participation
in
their
rights
,
privileges
,
and
immunities
.
 
<EOS>
Thereupon
Mr
Tappertit
flourished
the
bone
again
,
and
giving
the
other
skull
a
prodigious
rap
on
the
nose
,
exclaimed
"
Admit
him
!
"
 
<EOS>
At
these
dread
words
the
'
prentice
bowed
once
more
,
and
so
withdrew
as
he
had
come
.
  
<EOS>
There
soon
appeared
at
the
same
door
,
two
other
'
prentices
,
having
between
them
a
third
,
whose
eyes
were
bandaged
,
and
who
was
attired
in
a
bag
-
wig
,
and
a
broad
-
skirted
coat
,
trimmed
with
tarnished
lace
;
and
who
was
girded
with
a
sword
,
in
compliance
with
the
laws
of
the
Institution
regulating
the
introduction
of
candidates
,
which
required
them
to
assume
this
courtly
dress
,
and
kept
it
constantly
in
lavender
,
for
their
convenience
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
the
conductors
of
this
novice
held
a
rusty
blunderbuss
pointed
towards
his
ear
,
and
the
other
a
very
ancient
sabre
,
with
which
he
carved
imaginary
offenders
as
he
came
along
in
a
sanguinary
and
anatomical
manner
.
  
<EOS>
As
this
silent
group
advanced
,
Mr
Tappertit
fixed
his
hat
upon
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
The
novice
then
laid
his
hand
upon
his
breast
and
bent
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
humbled
himself
sufficiently
,
the
captain
ordered
the
bandage
to
be
removed
,
and
proceeded
to
eye
him
over
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
"
said
the
captain
,
thoughtfully
,
when
he
had
concluded
this
ordeal
.
 
<EOS>
"
Proceed
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
long
comrade
read
aloud
as
follows
:

<EOS>
Can
not
say
that
Curzon
's
daughter
loves
him
.
 
<EOS>
Should
think
it
probable
.
 
<EOS>
Curzon
pulled
his
ears
last
Tuesday
week
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
!
"
cried
the
captain
,
starting
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
looking
at
his
daughter
,
please
you
,
"
said
the
novice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Write
Curzon
down
,
Denounced
,
"
said
the
captain
.
 
<EOS>
"
Put
a
black
cross
against
the
name
of
Curzon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
please
you
,
"
said
the
novice
,
<EOS>
"
that
's
not
the
worst
---
he
calls
his
'
prentice
idle
dog
,
and
stops
his
beer
unless
he
works
to
his
liking
.
 
<EOS>
He
gives
Dutch
cheese
,
too
,
eating
Cheshire
,
sir
,
himself
;
and
Sundays
out
,
are
only
once
a
month
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
,
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
gravely
,
"
is
a
flagrant
case
.
 
<EOS>
Put
two
black
crosses
to
the
name
of
Curzon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
the
society
,
"
said
the
novice
,
who
was
an
ill
-
looking
,
one
-
sided
,
shambling
lad
,
with
sunken
eyes
set
close
together
in
his
head
---
"
if
the
society
would
burn
his
house
down
---
for
he
's
not
insured
---
or
beat
him
as
he
comes
home
from
his
club
at
night
,
or
help
me
to
carry
off
his
daughter
,
and
marry
her
at
the
Fleet
,
whether
she
gave
consent
or
no
---
"
  
Mr
Tappertit
waved
his
grizzly
truncheon
as
an
admonition
to
him
not
to
interrupt
,
and
ordered
three
black
crosses
to
the
name
of
Curzon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Which
means
,
"
he
said
in
gracious
explanation
,
"
vengeance
,
complete
and
terrible
.
 
<EOS>
'
Prentice
,
do
you
love
the
Constitution
?
"
  
<EOS>
To
which
the
novice
(
being
to
that
end
instructed
by
his
attendant
sponsors
)
replied
"
I
do
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
Church
,
the
State
,
and
everything
established
---
but
the
masters
?
"
quoth
the
captain
.
  
<EOS>
Again
the
novice
said
"
I
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
Having
said
it
,
he
listened
meekly
to
the
captain
,
who
in
an
address
prepared
for
such
occasions
,
told
him
how
that
under
that
same
Constitution
(
which
was
kept
in
a
strong
box
somewhere
,
but
where
exactly
he
could
not
find
out
,
or
he
would
have
endeavoured
to
procure
a
copy
of
it
)
,
the
'
prentices
had
,
in
times
gone
by
,
had
frequent
holidays
of
right
,
broken
people
's
heads
by
scores
,
defied
their
masters
,
nay
,
even
achieved
some
glorious
murders
in
the
streets
,
which
privileges
had
gradually
been
wrested
from
them
,
and
in
all
which
noble
aspirations
they
were
now
restrained
;
how
the
degrading
checks
imposed
upon
them
were
unquestionably
attributable
to
the
innovating
spirit
of
the
times
,
and
how
they
united
therefore
to
resist
all
change
,
except
such
change
as
would
restore
those
good
old
English
customs
,
by
which
they
would
stand
or
fall
.
 
<EOS>
After
illustrating
the
wisdom
of
going
backward
,
by
reference
to
that
sagacious
fish
,
the
crab
,
and
the
not
unfrequent
practice
of
the
mule
and
donkey
,
he
described
their
general
objects
;
which
were
briefly
vengeance
on
their
Tyrant
Masters
(
of
whose
grievous
and
insupportable
oppression
no
'
prentice
could
entertain
a
moment
's
doubt
)
and
the
restoration
,
as
aforesaid
,
of
their
ancient
rights
and
holidays
;
for
neither
of
which
objects
were
they
now
quite
ripe
,
being
barely
twenty
strong
,
but
which
they
pledged
themselves
to
pursue
with
fire
and
sword
when
needful
.
<EOS>
Then
he
described
the
oath
which
every
member
of
that
small
remnant
of
a
noble
body
took
,
and
which
was
of
a
dreadful
and
impressive
kind
;
binding
him
,
at
the
bidding
of
his
chief
,
to
resist
and
obstruct
the
Lord
Mayor
,
sword
-
bearer
,
and
chaplain
;
to
despise
the
authority
of
the
sheriffs
;
and
to
hold
the
court
of
aldermen
as
nought
;
but
not
on
any
account
,
<EOS>
in
case
the
fulness
of
time
should
bring
a
general
rising
of
'
prentices
,
to
damage
or
in
any
way
disfigure
Temple
Bar
,
which
was
strictly
constitutional
and
always
to
be
approached
with
reverence
.
 
<EOS>
Having
gone
over
these
several
heads
with
great
eloquence
and
force
,
and
having
further
informed
the
novice
that
this
society
had
its
origin
in
his
own
teeming
brain
,
stimulated
by
a
swelling
sense
of
wrong
and
outrage
,
Mr
Tappertit
demanded
whether
he
had
strength
of
heart
to
take
the
mighty
pledge
required
,
or
whether
he
would
withdraw
while
retreat
was
yet
in
his
power
.
  
<EOS>
To
this
the
novice
made
rejoinder
,
that
he
would
take
the
vow
,
though
it
should
choke
him
;
and
it
was
accordingly
administered
with
many
impressive
circumstances
,
among
which
the
lighting
up
of
the
two
skulls
with
a
candle
-
end
inside
of
each
,
and
a
great
many
flourishes
with
the
bone
,
were
chiefly
conspicuous
;
not
to
mention
a
variety
of
grave
exercises
with
the
blunderbuss
and
sabre
,
and
some
dismal
groaning
by
unseen
'
prentices
without
.
 
<EOS>
All
these
dark
and
direful
ceremonies
being
at
length
completed
,
the
table
was
put
aside
,
the
chair
of
state
removed
,
the
sceptre
locked
up
in
its
usual
cupboard
,
the
doors
of
communication
between
the
three
cellars
thrown
freely
open
,
and
the
'
Prentice
Knights
resigned
themselves
to
merriment
.
  
<EOS>
But
Mr
Tappertit
,
who
had
a
soul
above
the
vulgar
herd
,
and
who
,
on
account
of
his
greatness
,
could
only
afford
to
be
merry
now
and
then
,
threw
himself
on
a
bench
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
was
faint
with
dignity
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
with
an
indifferent
eye
,
alike
on
skittles
,
cards
,
and
dice
,
thinking
only
of
the
locksmith
's
daughter
,
and
the
base
degenerate
days
on
which
he
had
fallen
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
noble
captain
neither
games
,
nor
sings
,
nor
dances
,
"
said
his
host
,
taking
a
seat
beside
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Drink
,
gallant
general
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Tappertit
drained
the
proffered
goblet
to
the
dregs
;
then
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
,
and
with
a
lowering
visage
walked
among
the
skittles
,
while
his
followers
(
such
is
the
influence
of
superior
genius
)
restrained
the
ardent
ball
,
and
held
his
little
shins
in
dumb
respect
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
been
born
a
corsair
or
a
pirate
,
a
brigand
,
genteel
highwayman
or
patriot
---
and
they
're
the
same
thing
,
"
thought
Mr
Tappertit
,
musing
among
the
nine
-
pins
,
"
I
should
have
been
all
right
.
 
<EOS>
But
to
drag
out
a
ignoble
existence
unbeknown
to
mankind
in
general
---
patience
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
be
famous
yet
.
 
<EOS>
A
voice
within
me
keeps
on
whispering
Greatness
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
burst
out
one
of
these
days
,
and
when
I
do
,
what
power
can
keep
me
down
?
 
<EOS>
I
feel
my
soul
getting
into
my
head
at
the
idea
.
 
<EOS>
More
drink
there
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
novice
,
"
pursued
Mr
Tappertit
,
not
exactly
in
a
voice
of
thunder
,
for
his
tones
,
to
say
the
truth
were
rather
cracked
and
shrill
---
but
very
impressively
,
notwithstanding
---
<EOS>
"
where
is
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Here
,
noble
captain
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Stagg
.
 
<EOS>
"
One
stands
beside
me
who
I
feel
is
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Have
you
,
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
,
letting
his
gaze
fall
on
the
party
<EOS>
indicated
,
who
was
indeed
the
new
knight
,
by
this
time
restored
to
his
own
apparel
;
"
Have
you
the
impression
of
your
street
-
door
key
in
wax
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
long
comrade
anticipated
the
reply
,
by
producing
it
from
the
shelf
on
which
it
had
been
deposited
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
,
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
,
scrutinising
it
attentively
,
while
a
breathless
silence
reigned
around
;
for
he
had
constructed
secret
door
-
keys
for
the
whole
society
,
and
perhaps
owed
something
of
his
influence
to
that
mean
and
trivial
circumstance
---
on
such
slight
accidents
do
even
men
of
mind
depend
!
<EOS>
---
"
This
is
easily
made
.
 
<EOS>
Come
hither
,
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
,
he
beckoned
the
new
knight
apart
,
and
putting
the
pattern
in
his
pocket
,
motioned
to
him
to
walk
by
his
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
,
"
he
said
,
when
they
had
taken
a
few
turns
up
and
down
,
you
---
you
love
your
master
's
daughter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
said
the
'
prentice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Honour
bright
.
 
<EOS>
No
chaff
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Have
you
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Tappertit
,
catching
him
by
the
wrist
,
and
giving
him
a
look
which
would
have
been
expressive
of
the
most
deadly
malevolence
,
but
for
an
accidental
hiccup
that
rather
interfered
with
it
;
"
have
you
a
---
a
rival
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
as
I
know
on
,
"
replied
the
'
prentice
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
had
now
---
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
---
"
what
would
you
---
eh
?
---
"
  
The
'
prentice
looked
fierce
and
clenched
his
fists
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
enough
,
"
cried
Mr
Tappertit
hastily
,
"
we
understand
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
observed
.
 
<EOS>
I
thank
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
cast
him
off
again
;
and
calling
the
long
comrade
aside
after
taking
a
few
hasty
turns
by
himself
,
bade
him
immediately
write
and
post
against
the
wall
,
a
notice
,
proscribing
one
Joseph
Willet
(
commonly
known
as
Joe
)
of
Chigwell
;
forbidding
all
'
Prentice
Knights
to
succour
,
comfort
,
or
hold
communion
with
him
;
and
requiring
them
,
on
pain
of
excommunication
,
to
molest
,
hurt
,
wrong
,
annoy
,
and
pick
quarrels
with
the
said
Joseph
,
whensoever
and
wheresoever
they
,
or
any
of
them
,
should
happen
to
encounter
him
.
  
<EOS>
Having
relieved
his
mind
by
this
energetic
proceeding
,
he
condescended
to
approach
the
festive
board
,
and
warming
by
degrees
,
at
length
deigned
to
preside
,
and
even
to
enchant
the
company
with
a
song
.
 
<EOS>
After
this
,
he
rose
to
such
a
pitch
as
to
consent
to
regale
the
society
with
a
hornpipe
,
which
be
actually
performed
to
the
music
of
a
fiddle
(
played
by
an
ingenious
member
)
with
such
surpassing
agility
and
brilliancy
of
execution
,
that
the
spectators
could
not
be
sufficiently
enthusiastic
in
their
admiration
;
and
their
host
protested
,
with
tears
in
his
eyes
,
that
he
had
never
truly
felt
his
blindness
until
that
moment
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
host
withdrawing
---
probably
to
weep
in
secret
---
soon
returned
with
the
information
that
it
wanted
little
more
than
an
hour
of
day
,
and
that
all
the
cocks
in
Barbican
had
already
begun
to
crow
,
as
if
their
lives
depended
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
intelligence
,
the
'
Prentice
Knights
arose
in
haste
,
and
marshalling
into
a
line
,
filed
off
one
by
one
and
dispersed
with
all
speed
to
their
several
homes
,
leaving
their
leader
to
pass
the
grating
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
night
,
noble
captain
,
"
whispered
the
blind
man
as
he
held
it
open
for
his
passage
out
;
"
Farewell
,
brave
general
.
 
<EOS>
Bye
,
bye
,
illustrious
commander
.
 
<EOS>
Good
luck
go
with
you
for
a
---
conceited
,
bragging
,
empty
-
headed
,
duck
-
legged
idiot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
which
parting
words
,
coolly
added
as
he
listened
to
his
receding
footsteps
and
locked
the
grate
upon
himself
,
he
descended
the
steps
,
and
lighting
the
fire
below
the
little
copper
,
prepared
,
without
any
assistance
,
for
his
daily
occupation
;
which
was
to
retail
at
the
area
-
head
above
pennyworths
of
broth
and
soup
,
and
savoury
puddings
,
compounded
of
such
scraps
as
were
to
be
bought
in
the
heap
for
the
least
money
at
Fleet
Market
in
the
evening
time
;
and
for
the
sale
of
which
he
had
need
to
have
depended
chiefly
on
his
private
connection
,
for
the
court
had
no
thoroughfare
,
and
was
not
that
kind
of
place
in
which
many
people
were
likely
to
take
the
air
,
or
to
frequent
as
an
agreeable
promenade
.

Thrice
blessed
be
this
last
consideration
,
since
it
enables
us
to
follow
the
disdainful
Miggs
even
into
the
sanctity
of
her
chamber
,
and
to
hold
her
in
sweet
companionship
through
the
dreary
watches
of
the
night
!
  
<EOS>
Miss
Miggs
,
having
undone
her
mistress
,
as
she
phrased
it
(
which
means
,
assisted
to
undress
her
)
,
and
having
seen
her
comfortably
to
bed
in
the
back
room
on
the
first
floor
,
withdrew
to
her
own
apartment
,
in
the
attic
story
.
 
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
her
declaration
in
the
locksmith
's
presence
,
she
was
in
no
mood
for
sleep
;
so
,
putting
her
light
upon
the
table
and
withdrawing
the
little
window
curtain
,
she
gazed
out
pensively
at
the
wild
night
sky
.
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
she
wondered
what
star
was
destined
for
her
habitation
when
she
had
run
her
little
course
below
;
perhaps
speculated
which
of
those
glimmering
spheres
might
be
the
natal
orb
of
Mr
Tappertit
;
perhaps
marvelled
how
they
could
gaze
down
on
that
perfidious
creature
,
man
,
and
not
sicken
and
turn
green
as
chemists
'
lamps
;
perhaps
thought
of
nothing
in
particular
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
she
thought
about
,
there
she
sat
,
until
her
attention
,
alive
to
anything
connected
with
the
insinuating
'
prentice
,
was
attracted
by
a
noise
in
the
next
room
to
her
own
---
his
room
;
the
room
in
which
he
slept
,
and
dreamed
---
it
might
be
,
sometimes
dreamed
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
That
he
was
not
dreaming
now
,
unless
he
was
taking
a
walk
in
his
sleep
,
was
clear
,
for
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
there
came
a
shuffling
noise
,
as
though
he
were
engaged
in
polishing
the
whitewashed
wall
;
then
a
gentle
creaking
of
his
door
;
then
the
faintest
indication
of
his
stealthy
footsteps
on
the
landing
-
place
outside
.
 
<EOS>
Noting
this
latter
circumstance
,
Miss
Miggs
turned
pale
and
shuddered
,
as
mistrusting
his
intentions
;
and
more
than
once
exclaimed
,
below
her
breath
,
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
what
a
Providence
<EOS>
it
is
,
as
I
am
bolted
in
!
"
---
which
,
owing
doubtless
to
her
alarm
,
was
a
confusion
of
ideas
on
her
part
between
a
bolt
and
its
use
;
for
though
there
was
one
on
the
door
,
it
was
not
fastened
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Miggs
's
sense
of
hearing
,
however
,
having
as
sharp
an
edge
as
her
temper
,
and
being
of
the
same
snappish
and
suspicious
kind
,
very
soon
informed
her
that
the
footsteps
passed
her
door
,
and
appeared
to
have
some
object
quite
separate
and
disconnected
from
herself
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
discovery
she
became
more
alarmed
than
ever
,
and
was
about
to
give
utterance
to
those
cries
of
"
Thieves
!
"
and
"
Murder
!
"
<EOS>
which
she
had
hitherto
restrained
,
when
it
occurred
to
her
to
look
softly
out
,
and
see
that
her
fears
had
some
good
palpable
foundation
.
  
<EOS>
Looking
out
accordingly
,
and
stretching
her
neck
over
the
handrail
,
she
descried
,
to
her
great
amazement
,
Mr
Tappertit
completely
dressed
,
stealing
downstairs
,
<EOS>
one
step
at
a
time
,
with
his
shoes
in
one
hand
and
a
lamp
in
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
Following
him
with
her
eyes
,
and
going
down
a
little
way
herself
to
get
the
better
of
an
intervening
angle
,
she
beheld
him
thrust
his
head
in
at
the
parlour
-
door
,
draw
it
back
again
with
great
swiftness
,
and
immediately
begin
a
retreat
upstairs
with
all
possible
expedition
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
's
mysteries
!
"
said
the
damsel
,
when
she
was
safe
in
her
own
room
again
,
quite
out
of
breath
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
gracious
,
here
's
mysteries
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
prospect
of
finding
anybody
out
in
anything
,
would
have
kept
Miss
Miggs
awake
under
the
influence
of
henbane
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
,
she
heard
the
step
again
,
as
she
would
have
done
if
it
had
been
that
of
a
feather
endowed
with
motion
and
walking
down
on
tiptoe
.
 
<EOS>
Then
gliding
out
as
before
,
she
again
beheld
the
retreating
figure
of
the
'
prentice
;
again
he
looked
cautiously
in
at
the
parlour
-
door
,
but
this
time
instead
of
retreating
,
he
passed
in
and
disappeared
.
  
<EOS>
Miggs
was
back
in
her
room
,
and
had
her
head
out
of
the
window
,
before
an
elderly
gentleman
could
have
winked
and
recovered
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
Out
he
came
at
the
street
-
door
,
shut
it
carefully
behind
him
,
tried
it
with
his
knee
,
and
swaggered
off
,
putting
something
in
his
pocket
as
he
went
along
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
spectacle
Miggs
cried
"
Gracious
!
"
<EOS>
again
,
and
then
"
Goodness
gracious
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
"
Goodness
gracious
me
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
,
candle
in
hand
,
went
downstairs
as
he
had
done
.
<EOS>
Coming
to
the
workshop
,
she
saw
the
lamp
burning
on
the
forge
,
and
everything
as
Sim
had
left
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
I
wish
I
may
only
have
a
walking
funeral
,
and
never
be
buried
decent
with
a
mourning
-
coach
and
feathers
,
if
the
boy
has
n't
been
and
made
a
key
for
his
own
self
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Miggs
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
the
little
villain
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
conclusion
was
not
arrived
at
without
consideration
,
and
much
peeping
and
peering
about
;
nor
was
it
unassisted
by
the
recollection
that
she
had
on
several
occasions
<EOS>
come
upon
the
'
prentice
suddenly
,
and
found
him
busy
at
some
mysterious
occupation
.
 
<EOS>
Lest
the
fact
of
Miss
Miggs
calling
him
,
on
whom
she
stooped
to
cast
a
favourable
eye
,
a
boy
,
should
create
surprise
in
any
breast
,
it
may
be
observed
that
she
invariably
affected
to
regard
all
male
bipeds
under
thirty
as
mere
chits
and
infants
;
which
phenomenon
is
not
unusual
in
ladies
of
Miss
Miggs
's
temper
,
and
is
indeed
generally
found
to
be
the
associate
of
such
indomitable
and
savage
virtue
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Miggs
deliberated
within
herself
for
some
little
time
,
looking
hard
at
the
shop
-
door
while
she
did
so
,
as
though
her
eyes
and
thoughts
were
both
upon
it
;
and
then
,
taking
a
sheet
of
paper
from
a
drawer
,
twisted
it
into
a
long
thin
spiral
tube
.
 
<EOS>
Having
filled
this
instrument
with
a
quantity
of
small
coal
-
dust
from
the
forge
,
she
approached
the
door
,
and
dropping
on
one
knee
before
it
,
dexterously
blew
into
the
keyhole
as
much
of
these
fine
ashes
as
the
lock
would
hold
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
had
filled
it
to
the
brim
in
a
very
workmanlike
and
skilful
manner
,
she
crept
upstairs
again
,
and
chuckled
as
she
went
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
cried
Miggs
,
rubbing
her
hands
,
"
now
let
's
see
whether
you
wo
n't
be
glad
to
take
some
notice
of
me
,
mister
.
 
<EOS>
He
,
he
,
he
!
<EOS>
You
'll
have
eyes
for
somebody
besides
Miss
Dolly
now
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
A
fat
-
faced
puss
she
is
,
<EOS>
as
ever
I
come
across
!
"
  
<EOS>
As
she
uttered
this
criticism
,
she
glanced
approvingly
at
her
small
mirror
,
as
who
should
say
,
I
thank
my
stars
that
ca
n't
be
said
of
me
!
<EOS>
---
as
it
certainly
could
not
;
for
Miss
Miggs
's
style
of
beauty
was
of
that
kind
which
Mr
Tappertit
himself
had
not
inaptly
termed
,
in
private
,
"
scraggy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
go
to
bed
this
night
!
"
<EOS>
said
Miggs
,
wrapping
herself
in
a
shawl
,
and
drawing
a
couple
of
chairs
near
the
window
,
flouncing
down
upon
one
,
and
putting
her
feet
upon
the
other
,
"
till
you
come
home
,
my
lad
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
,
"
said
Miggs
viciously
,
"
no
,
not
for
five
-
and
-
forty
pound
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
,
and
with
an
expression
of
face
in
which
a
great
number
of
opposite
ingredients
,
such
as
mischief
,
cunning
,
malice
,
triumph
,
and
patient
expectation
,
were
all
mixed
up
together
in
a
kind
of
physiognomical
punch
,
Miss
Miggs
composed
herself
to
wait
and
listen
,
like
some
fair
ogress
who
had
set
a
trap
and
was
watching
for
a
nibble
from
a
plump
young
traveller
.
  
<EOS>
She
sat
there
,
with
perfect
composure
,
all
night
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
just
upon
break
of
day
,
there
was
a
footstep
in
the
street
,
and
presently
she
could
hear
Mr
Tappertit
stop
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
could
make
out
that
he
tried
his
key
---
that
he
was
blowing
into
it
---
 
that
he
knocked
it
on
the
nearest
post
to
beat
the
dust
out
---
that
he
took
it
under
a
lamp
to
look
at
it
---
that
he
poked
bits
of
stick
into
the
lock
to
clear
it
---
that
he
peeped
into
the
keyhole
,
first
with
one
eye
,
and
then
with
the
other
---
that
he
tried
the
key
again
---
 
that
he
could
n't
turn
it
,
and
what
was
worse
<EOS>
,
could
n't
get
it
out
---
 
that
he
bent
it
---
<EOS>
that
then
it
was
much
less
disposed
to
come
out
than
before
---
that
he
gave
it
a
mighty
twist
and
a
great
pull
,
and
then
it
came
out
so
suddenly
that
he
staggered
backwards
---
that
he
kicked
the
door
---
that
he
shook
it
---
finally
,
that
he
smote
his
forehead
,
and
sat
down
on
the
step
in
despair
.
  
<EOS>
When
this
crisis
had
arrived
,
Miss
Miggs
,
affecting
to
be
exhausted
with
terror
,
and
to
cling
to
the
window
-
sill
for
support
,
put
out
her
nightcap
,
and
demanded
in
a
faint
voice
who
was
there
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Tappertit
cried
"
Hush
!
"
<EOS>
and
,
backing
to
the
road
,
exhorted
her
in
frenzied
pantomime
to
secrecy
and
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
one
thing
,
"
said
Miggs
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
it
thieves
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
---
no
---
no
!
"
cried
Mr
Tappertit
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
said
Miggs
,
more
faintly
than
before
,
"
it
's
fire
.
 
<EOS>
Where
is
it
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
It
's
near
this
room
,
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
a
good
conscience
,
sir
,
and
would
much
rather
die
than
go
down
a
ladder
.
 
<EOS>
All
I
wish
is
,
respecting
my
love
to
my
married
sister
,
Golden
Lion
Court
,
number
twenty

sivin

<EOS>
"
  
"
Miggs

"
cried
Mr
Tappertit
,
"
do
n't
you
know
me
?
 
<EOS>
Sim
,
you
know
---
 
Sim
---
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
what
about
him
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Miggs
,
clasping
her
hands
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
he
in
any
danger
?
 
<EOS>
Is
he
in
the
midst
of
flames
and
blazes
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
gracious
,
gracious
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
I
'm
here
,
an't
<EOS>
I
?
"
rejoined
Mr
Tappertit
,
knocking
himself
on
the
breast
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
see
me
?
 
<EOS>
What
a
fool
you
are
,
Miggs
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
cried
Miggs
,
unmindful
of
this
compliment
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
---
so
it
---
 
Goodness
,
what
is
the
meaning
of
---
<EOS>
If
you
please

"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
!
"
cried
Mr
Tappertit
,
standing
on
tiptoe
,
as
if
by
that
means
he
,
in
the
street
,
were
any
nearer
being
able
to
stop
the
mouth
of
Miggs
in
the
garret
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
!
<EOS>
---
I
've
been
out
without
leave
,
and
something
or
another
's
the
matter
with
the
lock
.
 
<EOS>
Come
down
,
and
undo
the
shop
window
,
that
I
may
get
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dursn't
do
it
,
Simmun
,
"
cried
Miggs
---
for
that
was
her
pronunciation
of
his
Christian
name
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
dursn't
do
it
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
You
know
as
well
as
anybody
,
how
particular
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
And
to
come
down
in
the
dead
of
night
,
when
the
house
is
wrapped
in
slumbers
and
weiled
in
obscurity
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
there
she
stopped
and
shivered
,
for
her
modesty
caught
cold
at
the
very
thought
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
Miggs
,
"
cried
Mr
Tappertit
,
getting
under
the
lamp
,
that
she
might
see
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
darling
Miggs
---
"
  
Miggs
screamed
slightly
.
  
<EOS>
"
---
That
I
love
so
much
,
and
never
can
help
thinking
of
,
"
and
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
use
he
made
of
his
eyes
when
he
said
this
---
"
do
---
for
my
sake
,
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
Simmun
,
"
cried
Miggs
,
"
this
is
worse
than
all

<EOS>
I
know
if
I
come
down
,
you
'll
go

<EOS>
"
  
"
And
what
,
my
precious
?
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
try
,
"
said
Miggs
,
hysterically
,
"
to
kiss
me
,
or
some
such
dreadfulness
;
I
know
you
will
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
swear
I
wo
n't
,
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
,
with
remarkable
earnestness
.
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
soul
I
wo
n't
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
getting
broad
day
,
and
the
watchman
's
waking
up
.
 
<EOS>
Angelic
Miggs
!
 
<EOS>
If
you
'll
only
come
and
let
me
in

I
promise
you
faithfully

truly
I
wo

"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Miggs
,
whose
gentle
heart
was
touched
,
did
not
wait
for
the
oath
(
knowing
how
strong
the
temptation
was
,
and
fearing
he
might
forswear
himself
)
,
but
tripped
lightly
down
the
stairs
,
and
with
her
own
fair
hands
drew
back
the
rough
fastenings
of
the
workshop
window
.
 
<EOS>
Having
helped
the
wayward
'
prentice
in
,
she
faintly
articulated
the
words
"
Simmun
is
safe
!
"
<EOS>
and
yielding
to
her
woman
's
nature
,
immediately
became
insensible
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
knew
I
should
quench
her
,
"
said
Sim
,
rather
embarrassed
by
this
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
was
certain
it
would
come
to
this
,
but
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
---
if
I
had
n't
eyed
her
over
,
she
would
n't
have
come
down
.
 
<EOS>
Here
.
 
<EOS>
Keep
up
a
minute
,
Miggs
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
slippery
figure
she
is
!
 
<EOS>
There
's
no
holding
her
,
comfortably
.
 
<EOS>
Do
keep
up
a
minute
,
Miggs
,
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
As
Miggs
,
however
,
was
deaf
to
all
entreaties
,
Mr
Tappertit
leant
her
against
the
wall
as
one
might
dispose
of
a
walking
-
stick
or
umbrella
,
until
he
had
secured
the
window
,
when
he
took
her
in
his
arms
again
,
and
,
in
short
stages
and
with
great
difficulty
---
arising
from
her
being
tall
and
his
being
short
,
and
perhaps
in
some
degree
from
that
peculiar
physical
conformation
on
which
he
had
already
remarked
---
carried
her
upstairs
,
and
planting
her
,
in
the
same
umbrella
and
walking
-
stick
fashion
,
just
inside
her
own
door
,
left
her
to
her
repose
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
may
be
as
cool
as
he
likes
,
"
said
Miss
Miggs
,
recovering
as
soon
as
she
was
left
alone
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
'm
in
his
confidence
and
he
ca
n't
help
himself
,
nor
could
n't
if
he
was
twenty
Simmunses
!

Chapter

<EOS>
It
was
on
one
of
those
mornings
,
common
in
early
spring
,
when
the
year
,
fickle
and
changeable
in
its
youth
like
all
other
created
things
,
is
undecided
whether
to
step
backward
into
winter
or
forward
into
summer
,
and
in
its
uncertainty
inclines
now
to
the
one
and
now
to
the
other
,
and
now
to
both
at
once
---
wooing
summer
in
the
sunshine
,
and
lingering
still
with
winter
in
the
shade
---
it
was
,
in
short
,
on
one
of
those
mornings
,
when
it
is
hot
and
cold
,
wet
and
dry
,
bright
and
lowering
,
sad
and
cheerful
,
withering
and
genial
,
in
the
compass
of
one
short
hour
,
that
old
John
Willet
,
who
was
dropping
asleep
over
the
copper
boiler
,
was
roused
by
the
sound
of
a
horse
's
feet
,
and
glancing
out
at
window
,
beheld
a
traveller
of
goodly
promise
,
checking
his
bridle
at
the
Maypole
door
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
none
of
your
flippant
young
fellows
,
who
would
call
for
a
tankard
of
mulled
ale
,
and
make
themselves
as
much
at
home
as
if
they
had
ordered
a
hogshead
of
wine
;
none
of
your
audacious
young
swaggerers
,
who
would
even
penetrate
into
the
bar
---
that
solemn
sanctuary
---
and
,
smiting
old
John
upon
the
back
,
inquire
if
there
was
never
a
pretty
girl
in
the
house
,
and
where
he
hid
his
little
chambermaids
,
with
a
hundred
other
impertinences
of
that
nature
;
none
of
your
free
-
and
-
easy
companions
,
who
would
scrape
their
boots
upon
the
firedogs
in
the
common
room
,
and
be
not
at
all
particular
on
the
subject
of
spittoons
;
none
of
your
unconscionable
blades
,
requiring
impossible
chops
,
and
taking
unheard
-
of
pickles
for
granted
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
staid
,
grave
,
placid
gentleman
,
something
past
the
prime
of
life
,
yet
upright
in
his
carriage
,
for
all
that
,
and
slim
as
a
greyhound
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
well
-
mounted
upon
a
sturdy
chestnut
cob
,
and
had
the
graceful
seat
of
an
experienced
horseman
;
while
his
riding
gear
,
though
free
from
such
fopperies
as
were
then
in
vogue
,
was
handsome
and
well
chosen
.
 
<EOS>
He
wore
a
riding
-
coat
of
a
somewhat
brighter
green
than
might
have
been
expected
to
suit
the
taste
of
a
gentleman
of
his
years
,
with
a
short
,
black
velvet
cape
,
and
laced
pocket
-
holes
and
cuffs
,
all
of
a
jaunty
fashion
;
his
linen
,
too
,
was
of
the
finest
kind
,
worked
in
a
rich
pattern
at
the
wrists
and
throat
,
and
scrupulously
white
.
 
<EOS>
Although
he
seemed
,
judging
from
the
mud
he
had
picked
up
on
the
way
,
to
have
come
from
London
,
his
horse
was
as
smooth
and
cool
as
his
own
iron
-
grey
periwig
and
pigtail
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
man
nor
beast
had
turned
a
single
hair
;
and
saving
for
his
soiled
skirts
and
spatter
-
dashes
,
this
gentleman
,
with
his
blooming
face
,
white
teeth
,
exactly
-
ordered
dress
,
and
perfect
calmness
,
might
have
come
from
making
an
elaborate
and
leisurely
toilet
,
to
sit
for
an
equestrian
portrait
at
old
John
Willet
's
gate
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
supposed
that
John
observed
these
several
characteristics
by
other
than
very
slow
degrees
,
or
that
he
took
in
more
than
half
a
one
at
a
time
,
or
that
he
even
made
up
his
mind
upon
that
,
without
a
great
deal
of
very
serious
consideration
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
if
he
had
been
distracted
in
the
first
instance
by
questionings
and
orders
,
it
would
have
taken
him
at
the
least
a
fortnight
to
have
noted
what
is
here
set
down
;
but
it
happened
that
the
gentleman
,
being
struck
with
the
old
house
,
or
with
the
plump
pigeons
which
were
skimming
and
curtseying
about
it
,
or
with
the
tall
maypole
,
on
the
top
of
which
a
weathercock
,
which
had
been
out
of
order
for
fifteen
years
,
performed
a
perpetual
walk
to
the
music
of
its
own
creaking
,
sat
for
some
little
time
looking
round
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
Hence
John
,
standing
with
his
hand
upon
the
horse
's
bridle
,
and
his
great
eyes
on
the
rider
,
<EOS>
and
with
nothing
passing
to
divert
his
thoughts
,
had
really
got
some
of
these
little
circumstances
into
his
brain
by
the
time
he
was
called
upon
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
quaint
place
this
,
"
said
the
gentleman
---
and
his
voice
was
as
rich
as
his
dress
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
the
landlord
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
your
service
,
sir
,
"
replied
John
Willet
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
give
my
horse
good
stabling
,
<EOS>
can
you
,
and
me
an
early
dinner
(
I
am
not
particular
<EOS>
what
,
so
that
it
be
cleanly
served
)
,
and
a
decent
room
of
which
there
seems
to
be
no
lack
in
this
great
mansion
,
"
said
the
stranger
,
again
running
his
eyes
over
the
exterior
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
have
,
sir
,
"
returned
John
with
a
readiness
quite
surprising
,
"
anything
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
well
<EOS>
I
am
easily
satisfied
,
"
returned
the
other
with
a
smile
,
"
or
that
might
prove
a
hardy
pledge
,
my
friend
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
saying
so
,
he
dismounted
,
with
the
aid
of
the
block
before
the
door
,
in
a
twinkling
.
  
<EOS>
"
Halloa
there
!
 
<EOS>
Hugh
!
"
<EOS>
roared
John
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ask
your
pardon
,
sir
,
for
keeping
you
standing
in
the
porch
;
but
my
son
has
gone
to
town
on
business
,
and
the
boy
being
,
as
I
may
say
,
of
a
kind
of
use
to
me
,
I
'm
rather
put
out
when
he
's
away
.
 
<EOS>
Hugh
!
---
<EOS>
a
dreadful
idle
vagrant
fellow
,
sir
,
half
a
gipsy
,
as
I
think
---
always
sleeping
in
the
sun
in
summer
,
and
in
the
straw
in
winter
time
,
sir
---
Hugh
!
 
<EOS>
Dear
Lord
,
to
keep
a
gentleman
a
waiting
here
through
him
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Hugh
!
 
<EOS>
I
wish
that
chap
was
dead
,
I
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Possibly
he
is
,
"
returned
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
if
he
were
living
,
he
would
have
heard
you
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
his
fits
of
laziness
,
he
sleeps
so
desperate
hard
,
"
said
the
distracted
host
,
"
that
if
you
were
to
fire
off
cannon
-
balls
into
his
ears
,
it
would
n't
wake
him
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
guest
made
no
remark
upon
this
novel
cure
for
drowsiness
,
and
recipe
for
making
people
lively
,
but
,
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
,
stood
in
the
porch
,
very
much
amused
to
see
old
John
,
with
the
bridle
in
his
hand
,
wavering
between
a
strong
impulse
to
abandon
the
animal
to
his
fate
,
and
a
half
disposition
to
lead
him
into
the
house
,
and
shut
him
up
in
the
parlour
,
while
he
waited
on
his
master
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pillory
the
fellow
,
here
he
is
at
last
!
"
<EOS>
cried
John
,
in
the
very
height
and
zenith
of
his
distress
.
 
<EOS>
"
Did
you
hear
me
a
calling
,
villain
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
figure
he
addressed
made
no
answer
,
but
putting
his
hand
upon
the
saddle
,
sprung
into
it
at
a
bound
,
turned
the
horse
's
head
towards
the
stable
,
and
was
gone
in
an
instant
.
  
<EOS>
"
Brisk
enough
when
he
is
awake
,
"
said
the
guest
.
  
<EOS>
"
Brisk
enough
,
sir
!
"
replied
John
,
looking
at
the
place
where
the
horse
had
been
,
as
if
not
yet
understanding
quite
,
what
had
become
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
melts
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
He
goes
like
a
drop
of
froth
.
 
<EOS>
You
look
at
him
,
and
there
he
is
.
 
<EOS>
You
look
at
him
again
,
and
---
there
he
is
n't
.
"
  
<EOS>
Having
,
in
the
absence
of
any
more
words
,
put
this
sudden
climax
to
what
he
had
faintly
intended
should
be
a
long
explanation
of
the
whole
life
and
character
of
his
man
,
the
oracular
John
Willet
led
the
gentleman
up
his
wide
dismantled
staircase
into
the
Maypole
's
best
apartment
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
spacious
enough
in
all
conscience
,
occupying
the
whole
depth
of
the
house
,
and
having
at
either
end
a
great
bay
window
<EOS>
,
as
large
as
many
modern
rooms
;
in
which
some
few
panes
of
stained
glass
,
emblazoned
with
fragments
of
armorial
bearings
,
though
cracked
,
and
patched
,
and
shattered
,
yet
remained
;
attesting
,
by
their
presence
,
that
the
former
owner
had
made
the
very
light
subservient
to
his
state
,
and
pressed
the
sun
itself
into
his
list
of
flatterers
;
bidding
it
,
when
it
shone
into
his
chamber
,
reflect
the
badges
of
his
ancient
family
,
and
take
new
hues
and
colours
from
their
pride
.
  
<EOS>
But
those
were
old
days
,
and
now
every
little
ray
came
and
went
as
it
would
;
telling
the
plain
,
bare
,
searching
truth
.
 
<EOS>
Although
the
best
room
of
the
inn
,
it
had
the
melancholy
aspect
of
grandeur
in
decay
,
and
was
much
too
vast
for
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
Rich
rustling
hangings
,
waving
on
the
walls
;
and
,
better
far
,
the
rustling
of
youth
and
beauty
's
dress
;
the
light
of
women
's
eyes
,
outshining
the
tapers
and
their
own
rich
jewels
;
the
sound
of
gentle
tongues
,
and
music
,
and
the
tread
of
maiden
feet
,
had
once
been
there
,
and
filled
it
with
delight
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
were
gone
,
and
with
them
all
its
gladness
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
longer
a
home
;
children
were
never
born
and
bred
there
;
the
fireside
had
become
mercenary
---
a
something
to
be
bought
and
sold
---
a
very
courtezan
:
let
who
would
die
,
or
sit
beside
,
or
leave
it
,
it
was
still
the
same
---
it
missed
nobody
,
cared
for
nobody
,
had
equal
warmth
and
smiles
for
all
.
 
<EOS>
God
help
the
man
whose
heart
ever
changes
with
the
world
,
as
an
old
mansion
when
it
becomes
an
inn
!
  
<EOS>
No
effort
had
been
made
to
furnish
this
chilly
waste
,
but
before
the
broad
chimney
a
colony
of
chairs
and
tables
had
been
planted
on
a
square
of
carpet
,
flanked
by
a
ghostly
screen
,
enriched
with
figures
,
grinning
and
grotesque
.
 
<EOS>
After
lighting
with
his
own
hands
the
faggots
which
were
heaped
upon
the
hearth
,
old
John
withdrew
to
hold
grave
council
with
his
cook
,
touching
the
stranger
's
entertainment
;
while
the
guest
himself
,
seeing
small
comfort
in
the
yet
unkindled
wood
,
opened
a
lattice
in
the
distant
window
,
and
basked
in
a
sickly
gleam
of
cold
March
sun
.
  
<EOS>
Leaving
the
window
now
and
then
,
to
rake
the
crackling
logs
together
,
or
pace
the
echoing
room
from
end
to
end
,
he
closed
it
when
the
fire
was
quite
burnt
up
,
and
having
wheeled
the
easiest
chair
into
the
warmest
corner
,
summoned
John
Willet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
John
.
  
<EOS>
He
wanted
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
an
old
standish
on
the
mantelshelf
containing
a
dusty
apology
for
all
three
.
 
<EOS>
Having
set
this
before
him
,
the
landlord
was
retiring
,
when
he
motioned
him
to
stay
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
house
not
far
from
here
,
"
said
the
guest
when
he
had
written
a
few
lines
,
"
which
you
call
the
Warren
,
I
believe
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
this
was
said
in
the
tone
of
one
who
knew
the
fact
,
and
asked
the
question
as
a
thing
of
course
,
John
contented
himself
with
nodding
his
head
in
the
affirmative
;
at
the
same
time
taking
one
hand
out
of
his
pockets
to
cough
behind
,
and
then
putting
it
in
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
this
note
"
---
said
the
guest
,
glancing
on
what
he
had
written
,
and
folding
it
,
"
conveyed
there
without
loss
of
time
,
and
<EOS>
an
answer
brought
back
here
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
a
messenger
at
hand
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
John
was
thoughtful
for
a
minute
or
thereabouts
,
and
then
said
Yes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
him
,
"
said
the
guest
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
disconcerting
;
for
Joe
being
out
,
and
Hugh
engaged
in
rubbing
down
the
chestnut
cob
,
he
designed
sending
on
the
errand
,
Barnaby
,
who
had
just
then
arrived
in
one
of
his
rambles
,
and
who
,
so
that
he
thought
himself
employed
on
a
grave
and
serious
business
,
would
go
anywhere
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
the
truth
is
,
"
said
John
after
a
long
pause
,
"
that
the
person
who
'd
go
quickest
,
is
a
sort
of
natural
,
as
one
may
say
,
sir
;
and
though
quick
of
foot
,
and
as
much
to
be
trusted
as
the
post
itself
,
he
's
not
good
at
talking
,
being
touched
and
flighty
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
,
"
said
the
guest
,
raising
his
eyes
to
John
's
fat
face
<EOS>
,
"
you
do
n't
mean
---
what
's
the
fellow
's
name
---
you
do
n't
mean
Barnaby
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
do
,
"
returned
the
landlord
,
his
features
turning
quite
expressive
with
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
comes
he
to
be
here
?
"
inquired
the
guest
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
;
speaking
in
the
bland
,
even
tone
,
from
which
he
never
varied
;
and
with
the
same
soft
,
courteous
,
never
-
changing
smile
upon
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
saw
him
in
London
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
,
for
ever
,
here
one
hour
,
and
there
the
next
,
"
returned
old
John
,
after
the
usual
pause
to
get
the
question
in
his
mind
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Sometimes
he
walks
,
and
sometimes
runs
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
known
along
the
road
by
everybody
,
and
sometimes
comes
here
in
a
cart
or
chaise
,
and
sometimes
riding
double
.
 
<EOS>
He
comes
and
goes
,
through
wind
,
rain
,
snow
,
and
hail
,
and
on
the
darkest
nights
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
hurts
HIM
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
goes
often
to
the
Warren
,
does
he
not
?
"
said
the
guest
carelessly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
seem
to
remember
his
mother
telling
me
something
to
that
effect
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
was
not
attending
to
the
good
woman
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
right
,
sir
,
"
John
made
answer
,
"
he
does
.
 
<EOS>
His
father
,
sir
,
was
murdered
in
that
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
have
heard
,
"
returned
the
guest
,
taking
a
gold
toothpick
from
his
pocket
with
the
same
sweet
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
very
disagreeable
circumstance
for
the
family
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
,
"
said
John
with
a
puzzled
look
,
as
if
it
occurred
to
him
,
dimly
and
afar
off
,
that
this
might
by
possibility
be
a
cool
way
of
treating
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
the
circumstances
after
a
murder
,
"
said
the
guest
soliloquising
,
"
must
be
dreadfully
unpleasant
---
so
much
bustle
and
disturbance
---
no
repose
---
<EOS>
a
constant
dwelling
upon
one
subject
---
and
the
running
in
and
out
,
and
up
and
down
stairs
,
intolerable
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
have
such
a
thing
happen
to
anybody
<EOS>
I
was
nearly
interested
in
,
on
any
account
.
 
<EOS>
'
Twould
be
enough
to
wear
one
's
life
out
.
<EOS>
---
You
were
going
to
say
,
friend
---
"
he
added
,
turning
to
John
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
that
Mrs
Rudge
lives
on
a
little
pension
from
the
family
,
and
that
Barnaby
's
as
free
of
the
house
as
any
cat
or
dog
about
it
,
"
answered
John
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
he
do
your
errand
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
"
replied
the
guest
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
certainly
.
 
<EOS>
Let
him
do
it
by
all
means
.
 
<EOS>
Please
to
bring
him
here
that
I
may
charge
him
to
be
quick
.
<EOS>
If
he
objects
to
come
you
may
tell
him
it
's
Mr
Chester
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
remember
my
name
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
John
was
so
very
much
astonished
to
find
who
his
visitor
was
,
that
he
could
express
no
astonishment
at
all
,
by
looks
or
otherwise
,
but
left
the
room
as
if
he
were
in
the
most
placid
and
imperturbable
of
all
possible
conditions
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
been
reported
that
when
he
got
downstairs
,
he
looked
steadily
at
the
boiler
for
ten
minutes
by
the
clock
,
and
all
that
time
never
once
left
off
shaking
his
head
;
for
which
statement
there
would
seem
to
be
some
ground
of
truth
and
feasibility
,
inasmuch
as
that
interval
of
time
did
certainly
elapse
,
before
he
returned
with
Barnaby
to
the
guest
's
apartment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
hither
,
lad
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
Mr
Geoffrey
Haredale
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Barnaby
laughed
,
and
looked
at
the
landlord
as
though
he
would
say
,
"
You
hear
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
John
,
who
was
greatly
shocked
at
this
breach
of
decorum
,
clapped
his
finger
to
his
nose
,
and
shook
his
head
in
mute
remonstrance
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
knows
him
,
sir
,
"
said
John
,
frowning
aside
at
Barnaby
,
"
as
well
as
you
or
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
the
pleasure
of
much
acquaintance
with
the
gentleman
,
"
returned
his
guest
.
 
<EOS>
"
YOU
may
have
.
 
<EOS>
Limit
the
comparison
to
yourself
,
my
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Although
this
was
said
with
the
same
easy
affability
,
and
the
same
smile
,
John
felt
himself
put
down
,
and
laying
the
indignity
at
Barnaby
's
door
,
determined
to
kick
his
raven
,
on
the
very
first
opportunity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Give
that
,
"
said
the
guest
,
who
had
by
this
time
sealed
the
note
,
and
who
beckoned
his
messenger
towards
him
as
he
spoke
,
"
into
Mr
Haredale
's
own
hands
.
 
<EOS>
Wait
for
an
answer
,
and
bring
it
back
to
me
here
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
should
find
that
Mr
Haredale
is
engaged
just
now
,
tell
him
---
can
he
remember
a
message
,
landlord
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
he
chooses
,
sir
,
"
replied
John
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
wo
n't
forget
this
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
are
you
sure
of
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
John
merely
pointed
to
him
as
he
stood
with
his
head
bent
forward
,
and
his
earnest
gaze
fixed
closely
on
his
questioner
's
face
;
and
nodded
sagely
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
him
then
,
Barnaby
,
should
he
be
engaged
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
"
that
I
shall
be
glad
to
wait
his
convenience
here
,
and
to
see
him
(
if
he
will
call
)
at
any
time
this
evening
.
<EOS>
---
At
the
worst
I
can
have
a
bed
here
,
Willet
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
Old
John
,
immensely
flattered
by
the
personal
notoriety
implied
in
this
familiar
form
of
address
,
answered
,
with
something
like
a
knowing
look
,
"
I
should
believe
you
could
,
sir
,
"
and
was
turning
over
in
his
mind
various
forms
of
eulogium
,
with
the
view
of
selecting
one
appropriate
to
the
qualities
of
his
best
bed
,
when
his
ideas
were
put
to
flight
by
Mr
Chester
giving
Barnaby
the
letter
,
and
bidding
him
make
all
speed
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
Speed
!
<EOS>
"
said
Barnaby
,
folding
the
little
packet
in
his
breast
,
"
Speed
!
 
<EOS>
If
you
want
to
see
hurry
and
mystery
,
come
here
.
 
<EOS>
Here
!
"
  
With
that
,
he
put
his
hand
,
very
much
to
John
Willet
's
horror
,
on
the
guest
's
fine
broadcloth
sleeve
,
and
led
him
stealthily
to
the
back
window
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
down
there
,
"
he
said
softly
;
"
do
you
mark
how
they
whisper
in
each
other
's
ears
;
then
dance
and
leap
,
to
make
believe
they
are
in
sport
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
see
how
they
stop
for
a
moment
,
when
they
think
there
is
no
one
looking
,
and
mutter
among
themselves
again
;
and
then
how
they
roll
and
gambol
,
delighted
with
the
mischief
they
've
been
plotting
?
 
<EOS>
Look
at
'em
now
.
 
<EOS>
See
how
they
whirl
and
plunge
.
<EOS>
And
now
they
stop
again
,
and
whisper
,
cautiously
together
---
<EOS>
little
thinking
,
mind
<EOS>
,
how
often
I
have
lain
upon
the
grass
and
watched
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
what
is
it
that
they
plot
and
hatch
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
only
clothes
,
"
returned
the
guest
,
"
such
as
we
wear
;
hanging
on
those
lines
to
dry
,
and
fluttering
in
the
wind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Clothes
!
"
echoed
Barnaby
,
looking
close
into
his
face
,
and
falling
quickly
back
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
ha
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
how
much
better
to
be
silly
,
than
as
wise
as
you
!
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
see
shadowy
people
there
,
like
those
that
live
in
sleep
---
not
you
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
eyes
in
the
knotted
panes
of
glass
,
nor
swift
ghosts
when
it
blows
hard
,
nor
do
you
hear
voices
in
the
air
,
nor
see
men
stalking
in
the
sky
---
not
you
!
 
<EOS>
I
lead
a
merrier
life
than
you
,
with
all
your
cleverness
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
the
dull
men
.
<EOS>
We
're
the
bright
ones
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
not
change
with
you
,
clever
as
you
are
,
---
not
I
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
,
he
waved
his
hat
above
his
head
,
and
darted
off
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
strange
creature
,
upon
my
word
!
"
said
the
guest
,
pulling
out
a
handsome
box
,
and
taking
a
pinch
of
snuff
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
wants
imagination
,
"
said
Mr
Willet
,
very
slowly
,
and
after
a
long
silence
;
"
that
's
what
he
wants
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
tried
to
instil
it
into
him
,
many
and
many
's
the
time
;
but
"
---
John
added
this
in
confidence
---
 
<EOS>
"
he
an't
made
for
it
;
that
's
the
fact
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
To
record
that
Mr
Chester
smiled
at
John
's
remark
would
be
little
to
the
purpose
,
for
he
preserved
the
same
conciliatory
and
pleasant
look
at
all
times
.
 
<EOS>
He
drew
his
chair
nearer
to
the
fire
though
,
as
a
kind
of
hint
that
he
would
prefer
to
be
alone
,
and
John
,
having
no
reasonable
excuse
for
remaining
,
left
him
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Very
thoughtful
old
John
Willet
was
,
while
the
dinner
was
preparing
;
and
if
his
brain
were
ever
less
clear
at
one
time
than
another
,
it
is
but
reasonable
to
suppose
that
he
addled
it
in
no
slight
degree
by
shaking
his
head
so
much
that
day
.
 
<EOS>
That
Mr
Chester
,
between
whom
and
Mr
Haredale
,
it
was
notorious
to
all
the
neighbourhood
,
a
deep
and
bitter
animosity
existed
,
should
come
down
there
for
the
sole
purpose
,
as
it
seemed
,
of
seeing
him
,
and
should
choose
the
Maypole
for
their
place
of
meeting
,
and
should
send
to
him
express
,
were
stumbling
blocks
John
could
not
overcome
.
<EOS>
The
only
resource
he
had
,
was
to
consult
the
boiler
,
and
wait
impatiently
for
Barnaby
's
return
.
  
<EOS>
But
Barnaby
delayed
beyond
all
precedent
.
 
<EOS>
The
visitor
's
dinner
was
served
,
removed
,
his
wine
was
set
,
the
fire
replenished
,
the
hearth
clean
swept
;
the
light
waned
without
,
it
grew
dusk
,
became
quite
dark
,
and
still
no
Barnaby
appeared
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
,
though
John
Willet
was
full
of
wonder
and
misgiving
,
his
guest
sat
cross
-
legged
in
the
easy
-
chair
,
to
all
appearance
as
little
ruffled
in
his
thoughts
as
in
his
dress
---
<EOS>
the
same
calm
,
easy
,
cool
gentleman
,
without
a
care
or
thought
beyond
his
golden
toothpick
.
  
<EOS>
"
Barnaby
's
late
,
"
John
ventured
to
observe
,
as
he
placed
a
pair
of
tarnished
candlesticks
,
some
three
feet
high
,
upon
the
table
,
and
snuffed
the
lights
they
held
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
rather
so
,
"
replied
the
guest
,
sipping
his
wine
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
will
not
be
much
longer
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
John
coughed
and
raked
the
fire
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
your
roads
bear
no
very
good
character
,
if
I
may
judge
from
my
son
's
mishap
,
though
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
"
and
as
I
have
no
fancy
to
be
knocked
on
the
head
---
which
is
not
only
disconcerting
at
the
moment
,
but
places
one
,
besides
,
in
a
ridiculous
position
with
respect
to
the
people
who
chance
to
pick
one
up
<EOS>
---
I
shall
stop
here
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
you
said
you
had
a
bed
to
spare
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Such
a
bed
,
sir
,
"
returned
John
Willet
;
"
ay
,
such
a
bed
as
few
,
even
of
the
gentry
's
houses
,
own
.
 
<EOS>
A
fixter
here
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
heard
say
that
bedstead
is
nigh
two
hundred
years
of
age
.
 
<EOS>
Your
noble
son
---
a
fine
young
gentleman
---
slept
in
it
last
,
sir
,
half
a
year
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
life
,
a
recommendation
!
"
said
the
guest
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
wheeling
his
chair
nearer
to
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
"
See
that
it
be
well
aired
,
Mr
Willet
,
and
let
a
blazing
fire
be
lighted
there
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
This
house
is
something
damp
and
chilly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
John
raked
the
faggots
up
again
,
more
from
habit
than
presence
of
mind
,
or
any
reference
to
this
remark
,
and
was
about
to
withdraw
,
when
a
bounding
step
was
heard
upon
the
stair
,
and
Barnaby
came
panting
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
'll
have
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
in
an
hour
's
time
,
"
he
cried
,
advancing
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
been
riding
hard
all
day
---
has
just
come
home
---
 
but
will
be
in
the
saddle
again
as
soon
as
he
has
eat
and
drank
,
to
meet
his
loving
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
that
his
message
?
"
asked
the
visitor
,
looking
up
,
but
without
the
smallest
discomposure
---
or
at
least
without
the
show
of
any
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
but
the
last
words
,
"
Barnaby
rejoined
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
meant
those
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
that
,
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
for
your
pains
,
"
said
the
other
,
putting
money
in
his
hand
,
and
glancing
at
him
steadfastly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
for
your
pains
,
sharp
Barnaby
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
For
Grip
,
and
me
,
and
Hugh
,
to
share
among
us
,
"
he
rejoined
,
putting
it
up
,
and
nodding
,
as
he
counted
it
on
his
fingers
.
 
<EOS>
"
Grip
one
,
me
two
,
Hugh
three
;
the
dog
,
the
goat
,
the
cats
<EOS>
---
well
,
we
shall
spend
it
pretty
soon
,
I
warn
you
.
 
<EOS>
Stay
.
<EOS>
---
Look
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
wise
men
see
nothing
there
,
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
bent
eagerly
down
on
one
knee
,
and
gazed
intently
at
the
smoke
,
which
was
rolling
up
the
chimney
in
a
thick
black
cloud
.
 
<EOS>
John
Willet
,
who
appeared
to
consider
himself
particularly
and
chiefly
referred
to
under
the
term
wise
men
,
looked
that
way
likewise
,
and
with
great
solidity
of
feature
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
where
do
they
go
to
,
when
they
spring
so
fast
up
there
,
"
asked
Barnaby
;
"
eh
?
 
<EOS>
Why
do
they
tread
so
closely
on
each
other
's
heels
,
and
why
are
they
always
in
a
hurry
---
which
is
what
you

me

I

take
pattern
by
these
busy
folk
about
me

<EOS>
More
of
'em
!
<EOS>
catching
to
each
other

skirts
;
and
as
fast
as
they
go

others
come

<EOS>
What
a
merry
dance
it
is
!
 
<EOS>
I
would

Grip

I
could
frisk
like
that

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
has
he
in
that
basket
at
his
back
?
"
asked
the
guest
after
a
few
moments
,
during
which
Barnaby
was
still
bending
down
to
look
higher
up
the
chimney
,
and
earnestly
watching
the
smoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
this
?
"
he
answered
,
jumping
up
,
before
John
Willet
could
reply
---
 
shaking
it
as
he
spoke
,
and
stooping
his
head
to
listen
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
this
!
 
<EOS>
What
is
there
here
?
 
<EOS>
Tell
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
devil
,
a
devil
,
a
devil
!
"
cried
a
hoarse
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
's
money
!
"
said
Barnaby
,
chinking
it
in
his
hand
,
"
money
for
a
treat
,
Grip
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hurrah
!
 
<EOS>
Hurrah
!
 
<EOS>
Hurrah
!
<EOS>
"
replied
the
raven
,
"
keep
up
your
spirits
.
 
<EOS>
Never
say
die
.
 
<EOS>
Bow
,
wow
,
<EOS>
wow
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Willet
,
who
appeared
to
entertain
strong
doubts
whether
a
customer
in
a
laced
coat
and
fine
linen
could
be
supposed
to
have
any
acquaintance
even
with
the
existence
of
such
unpolite
gentry
as
the
bird
claimed
to
belong
to
,
took
Barnaby
off
at
this
juncture
,
with
the
view
of
preventing
any
other
improper
declarations
,
and
quitted
the
room
with
his
very
best
bow
.

Chapter
11
    
<EOS>
There
was
great
news
that
night
for
the
regular
Maypole
customers
,
to
each
of
whom
,
as
he
straggled
in
to
occupy
his
allotted
seat
in
the
chimney
-
corner
,
John
,
with
a
most
impressive
slowness
of
delivery
,
and
in
an
apoplectic
whisper
,
communicated
the
fact
that
Mr
Chester
was
alone
in
the
large
room
upstairs
,
and
was
waiting
the
arrival
of
Mr
Geoffrey
Haredale
,
to
whom
he
had
sent
a
letter
(
doubtless
of
a
threatening
nature
)
by
the
hands
of
Barnaby
,
then
and
there
present
.
  
<EOS>
For
a
little
knot
of
smokers
and
solemn
gossips
,
who
had
seldom
any
new
topics
of
discussion
,
this
was
a
perfect
Godsend
.
 
<EOS>
Here
was
a
good
,
dark
-
looking
mystery
progressing
under
that
very
roof
---
 
brought
home
to
the
fireside
,
as
it
were
,
and
enjoyable
without
the
smallest
pains
or
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
extraordinary
what
a
zest
and
relish
it
gave
to
the
drink
,
and
how
it
heightened
the
flavour
of
the
tobacco
.
 
<EOS>
Every
man
smoked
his
pipe
with
a
face
of
grave
and
serious
delight
,
and
looked
at
his
neighbour
with
a
sort
of
quiet
congratulation
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
it
was
felt
to
be
such
a
holiday
and
special
night
,
that
,
on
the
motion
of
little
Solomon
Daisy
,
every
man
(
including
John
himself
)
put
down
his
sixpence
for
a
can
of
flip
,
which
grateful
beverage
was
brewed
with
all
despatch
,
and
set
down
in
the
midst
of
them
on
the
brick
floor
;
both
that
it
might
simmer
and
stew
before
the
fire
,
and
that
its
fragrant
steam
,
rising
up
among
them
,
and
mixing
with
the
wreaths
of
vapour
from
their
pipes
,
might
shroud
them
in
a
delicious
atmosphere
of
their
own
,
and
shut
out
all
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
furniture
of
the
room
seemed
to
mellow
and
deepen
in
its
tone
;
the
ceiling
and
walls
looked
blacker
and
more
highly
polished
,
the
curtains
of
a
ruddier
red
;
the
fire
burnt
clear
and
high
,
and
the
crickets
in
the
hearthstone
chirped
with
a
more
than
wonted
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
present
two
,
however
,
who
showed
but
little
interest
in
the
general
contentment
.
 
<EOS>
Of
these
,
one
was
Barnaby
himself
,
who
slept
,
or
,
to
avoid
being
beset
with
questions
,
feigned
to
sleep
,
in
the
chimney
-
corner
;
the
other
,
Hugh
,
who
,
sleeping
too
,
lay
stretched
upon
the
bench
on
the
opposite
side
,
in
the
full
glare
of
the
blazing
fire
.
  
<EOS>
The
light
that
fell
upon
this
slumbering
form
,
showed
it
in
all
its
muscular
and
handsome
proportions
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
that
of
a
young
man
,
of
a
hale
athletic
figure
,
and
a
giant
's
strength
,
whose
sunburnt
face
and
swarthy
throat
,
overgrown
with
jet
black
hair
,
might
have
served
a
painter
for
a
model
.
 
<EOS>
Loosely
attired
,
in
the
coarsest
and
roughest
garb
,
with
scraps
of
straw
and
hay
---
his
usual
bed
---
 
clinging
here
and
there
,
and
mingling
with
his
uncombed
locks
,
he
had
fallen
asleep
in
a
posture
as
careless
as
his
dress
.
 
<EOS>
The
negligence
and
disorder
of
the
whole
man
,
with
something
fierce
and
sullen
in
his
features
,
gave
him
a
picturesque
appearance
,
that
attracted
the
regards
even
of
the
Maypole
customers
who
knew
him
well
,
and
caused
Long
Parkes
to
say
that
Hugh
looked
more
like
a
poaching
rascal
to
-
night
than
ever
he
had
seen
him
yet
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
waiting
here
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Solomon
,
"
to
take
Mr
Haredale
's
horse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
it
,
sir
,
"
replied
John
Willet
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
not
often
in
the
house
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
more
at
his
ease
among
horses
than
men
.
 
<EOS>
I
look
upon
him
as
a
animal
himself
.
"
  
<EOS>
Following
up
this
opinion
with
a
shrug
that
seemed
meant
to
say
,
"
we
ca
n't
expect
everybody
to
be
like
us
,
"
John
put
his
pipe
into
his
mouth
again
,
and
smoked
like
one
who
felt
his
superiority
over
the
general
run
of
mankind
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
chap
,
sir
,
"
said
John
,
taking
it
out
again
after
a
time
,
and
pointing
at
him
with
the
stem
,
"
though
he
's
got
all
his
faculties
about
him
---
bottled
up
and
corked
down
,
if
I
may
say
so
,
somewheres
or
another
---
<EOS>
"
  
"
Very
good
!
"
said
Parkes
,
nodding
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
very
good
expression
,
Johnny
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
be
a
tackling
somebody
presently
.
<EOS>
You
're
in
twig
to
-
night
,
I
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Take
care
,
"
said
Mr
Willet
,
not
at
all
grateful
for
the
compliment
,
"
that
I
do
n't
tackle
you
,
sir
,
which
I
shall
certainly
endeavour
to
do
,
if
you
interrupt
me
when
I
'm
making
observations
.
<EOS>
---
 
<EOS>
That
chap
,
I
was
a
saying
,
though
he
has
all
his
faculties
about
him
,
somewheres
or
another
,
bottled
up
and
corked
down
,
has
no
more
imagination
than
Barnaby
has
.
 
<EOS>
And
why
has
n't
he
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
three
friends
shook
their
heads
at
each
other
;
saying
by
that
action
,
without
the
trouble
of
opening
their
lips
,
"
Do
you
observe
what
a
philosophical
mind
our
friend
has
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
has
n't
he
?
"
said
John
,
gently
striking
the
table
with
his
open
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Because
they
was
never
drawed
out
of
him
when
he
was
a
boy
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
why
.
 
<EOS>
What
would
any
of
us
have
been
,
if
our
fathers
had
n't
drawed
our
faculties
out
of
us
?
 
<EOS>
What
would
my
boy
Joe
have
been
,
if
I
had
n't
drawed
his
faculties
out
of
him
?
---
<EOS>
Do
you
mind
what
I
'm
a
saying
of
,
gentlemen
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
we
mind
you
,
"
cried
Parkes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Go
on
improving
of
us
,
Johnny
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Consequently
,
then
,
"
said
Mr
Willet
,
"
that
chap
,
whose
mother
was
hung
when
he
was
a
little
boy
,
along
with
six
others
,
for
passing
bad
notes
---
<EOS>
and
it
's
a
blessed
thing
to
think
how
many
people
are
hung
in
batches
every
six
weeks
for
that
,
and
such
like
offences
,
as
showing
how
wide
awake
our
government
is
---
that
chap
that
was
then
turned
loose
,
and
had
to
mind
cows
,
and
frighten
birds
away
,
and
what
not
,
for
a
few
pence
to
live
on
,
and
so
got
on
by
degrees
to
mind
horses
,
and
to
sleep
in
course
of
time
in
lofts
and
litter
,
instead
of
under
haystacks
and
hedges
<EOS>
,
till
at
last
he
come
to
be
hostler
at
the
Maypole
for
his
board
and
lodging
and
a
annual
trifle
---
that
chap
that
ca
n't
read
nor
write
,
and
has
never
had
much
to
do
with
anything
but
animals
,
and
has
never
lived
in
any
way
but
like
the
animals
he
has
lived
among
,
IS
a
animal
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
"
said
Mr
Willet
,
arriving
at
his
logical
conclusion
,
"
is
to
be
treated
accordingly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Willet
,
"
said
Solomon
Daisy
,
who
had
exhibited
some
impatience
at
the
intrusion
of
so
unworthy
a
subject
on
their
more
interesting
theme
,
"
<EOS>
when
Mr
Chester
come
this
morning
,
did
he
order
the
large
room
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
signified
,
sir
,
"
said
John
,
"
that
he
wanted
a
large
apartment
.
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
Certainly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
then
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
"
said
Solomon
,
speaking
softly
and
with
an
earnest
look
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
and
Mr
Haredale
are
going
to
fight
a
duel
in
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Everybody
looked
at
Mr
Willet
,
after
this
alarming
suggestion
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Willet
looked
at
the
fire
,
weighing
in
his
own
mind
the
effect
which
such
an
occurrence
would
be
likely
to
have
on
the
establishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
John
,
"
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
---
I
am
sure
---
<EOS>
I
remember
that
when
I
went
up
last
,
he
HAD
put
the
lights
upon
the
mantel
-
shelf
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
as
plain
,
"
returned
Solomon
,
"
as
the
nose
on
Parkes
's
face
"
---
 
Mr
Parkes
,
who
had
a
large
nose
,
rubbed
it
,
and
looked
as
if
he
considered
this
a
personal
allusion
---
"
they
'll
fight
in
that
room
.
<EOS>
You
know
by
the
newspapers
what
a
common
thing
it
is
for
gentlemen
to
fight
in
coffee
-
houses
without
seconds
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
'em
will
be
wounded
or
perhaps
killed
in
this
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
was
a
challenge
that
Barnaby
took
then
,
eh
?
"
said
John
.
  
<EOS>
"
---
Inclosing
a
slip
of
paper
with
the
measure
of
his
sword
upon
it
,
I
'll
bet
a
guinea
,
"
answered
the
little
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
know
what
sort
of
gentleman
Mr
Haredale
is
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
told
us
what
Barnaby
said
about
his
looks
,
when
he
came
back
.
 
<EOS>
Depend
upon
it
,
I
'm
right
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
flip
had
had
no
flavour
till
now
.
 
<EOS>
The
tobacco
had
been
of
mere
English
growth
,
compared
with
its
present
taste
.
 
<EOS>
A
duel
in
that
great
old
rambling
room
upstairs
,
and
the
best
bed
ordered
already
for
the
wounded
man
!
  
<EOS>
"
Would
it
be
swords
or
pistols
,
now
?
"
said
John
.
  
<EOS>
"
Heaven
knows
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
both
,
"
returned
Solomon
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
gentlemen
wear
swords
,
and
may
easily
have
pistols
in
their
pockets
---
most
likely
have
,
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
If
they
fire
at
each
other
without
effect
,
then
they
'll
draw
,
and
go
to
work
in
earnest
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
shade
passed
over
Mr
Willet
's
face
as
he
thought
of
broken
windows
and
disabled
furniture
,
but
bethinking
himself
that
one
of
the
parties
would
probably
be
left
alive
to
pay
the
damage
,
he
brightened
up
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
then
,
"
said
Solomon
,
looking
from
face
to
face
,
"
then
we
shall
have
one
of
those
stains
upon
the
floor
that
never
come
out
.
 
<EOS>
If
Mr
Haredale
wins
,
depend
upon
it
,
it
'll
be
a
deep
one
;
or
if
he
loses
,
it
will
perhaps
be
deeper
still
,
for
he
'll
never
give
in
unless
he
's
beaten
down
.
 
<EOS>
We
know
him
better
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Better
indeed
!
"
<EOS>
they
whispered
all
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
to
its
ever
being
got
out
again
,
"
said
Solomon
,
"
I
tell
you
it
never
will
,
or
can
be
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
do
you
know
that
it
has
been
tried
,
at
a
certain
house
we
are
acquainted
with
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
Warren
!
"
cried
John
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
sure
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sure
---
<EOS>
yes
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
only
known
by
very
few
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
been
whispered
about
though
,
for
all
that
.
 
<EOS>
They
planed
the
board
away
,
but
there
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
They
went
deep
,
but
it
went
deeper
.
 
<EOS>
They
put
new
boards
down
,
but
there
was
one
great
spot
that
came
through
still
,
and
showed
itself
in
the
old
place
.
 
<EOS>
And
---
harkye
---
draw
nearer
<EOS>
---
Mr
Geoffrey
made
that
room
his
study
,
and
sits
there
,
always
,
with
his
foot
(
as
I
have
heard
)
upon
it
;
and
he
believes
,
through
thinking
of
it
long
and
very
much
,
that
it
will
never
fade
until
he
finds
the
man
who
did
the
deed
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
this
recital
ended
,
and
they
all
drew
closer
round
the
fire
,
the
tramp
of
a
horse
was
heard
without
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
very
man
!
"
<EOS>
cried
John
,
starting
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hugh
!
 
Hugh

"
  
<EOS>
The
sleeper
staggered
to
his
feet
,
and
hurried
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
John
quickly
returned
,
ushering
in
with
great
attention
and
deference
(
for
Mr
Haredale
<EOS>
was
his
landlord
)
<EOS>
the
long
-
expected
visitor
,
who
strode
into
the
room
clanking
his
heavy
boots
upon
the
floor
;
and
looking
keenly
round
upon
the
bowing
group
,
raised
his
hat
in
acknowledgment
of
their
profound
respect
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
stranger
here
,
Willet
,
who
sent
to
me
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
voice
which
sounded
naturally
stern
and
deep
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
is
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
great
room
upstairs
,
sir
,
"
answered
John
.
  
<EOS>
"
Show
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
Your
staircase
is
dark
,
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
good
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
,
he
signed
to
the
landlord
to
go
on
before
;
and
went
clanking
out
,
and
up
the
stairs
;
old
John
,
in
his
agitation
,
ingeniously
lighting
everything
but
the
way
,
and
making
a
stumble
at
every
second
step
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stop
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
when
they
reached
the
landing
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
announce
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
wait
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
laid
his
hand
upon
the
door
,
entered
,
and
shut
it
heavily
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Willet
was
by
no
means
disposed
to
stand
there
listening
by
himself
,
especially
as
the
walls
were
very
thick
;
so
descended
,
with
much
greater
alacrity
than
he
had
come
up
,
and
joined
his
friends
below
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
12
    
<EOS>
There
was
a
brief
pause
in
the
state
-
room
of
the
Maypole
,
as
Mr
Haredale
tried
the
lock
to
satisfy
himself
that
he
had
shut
the
door
securely
,
and
,
striding
up
the
dark
chamber
to
where
the
screen
inclosed
a
little
patch
of
light
and
warmth
,
presented
himself
,
abruptly
and
in
silence
,
before
the
smiling
guest
.
  
<EOS>
If
the
two
had
no
greater
sympathy
in
their
inward
thoughts
than
in
their
outward
bearing
and
appearance
,
the
meeting
did
not
seem
likely
to
prove
a
very
calm
or
pleasant
one
.
 
<EOS>
With
no
great
disparity
between
them
in
point
of
years
,
they
were
,
in
every
other
respect
,
as
unlike
and
far
removed
from
each
other
as
two
men
could
well
be
.
 
<EOS>
The
one
was
soft
-
spoken
,
delicately
made
,
precise
,
and
elegant
;
the
other
,
a
burly
square
-
built
man
,
negligently
dressed
,
rough
and
abrupt
in
manner
,
stern
,
and
,
in
his
present
mood
,
forbidding
both
in
look
and
speech
.
 
<EOS>
The
one
preserved
a
calm
and
placid
smile
;
the
other
,
a
distrustful
frown
.
 
<EOS>
The
new
-
comer
,
indeed
,
appeared
bent
on
showing
by
his
every
tone
and
gesture
his
determined
opposition
and
hostility
to
the
man
he
had
come
to
meet
.
<EOS>
The
guest
who
received
him
,
on
the
other
hand
,
seemed
to
feel
that
the
contrast
between
them
was
all
in
his
favour
,
and
to
derive
a
quiet
exultation
from
it
which
put
him
more
at
his
ease
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
Haredale
,
"
said
this
gentleman
,
without
the
least
appearance
of
embarrassment
or
reserve
,
"
I
am
very
glad
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
dispense
with
compliments
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
misplaced
between
us
,
"
returned
the
other
,
waving
his
hand
,
"
and
say
plainly
what
we
have
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
asked
me
to
meet
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
here
.
 
<EOS>
Why
do
we
stand
face
to
face
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Still
the
same
frank
and
sturdy
character
,
I
see
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
or
bad
,
sir
,
I
am
,
"
returned
the
other
,
leaning
his
arm
upon
the
chimney
-
piece
,
and
turning
a
haughty
look
upon
the
occupant
of
the
easy
-
chair
,
"
the
man
I
used
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
lost
no
old
likings
or
dislikings
;
my
memory
has
not
failed
me
by
a
hair's
-
breadth
.
<EOS>
You
ask
me
to
give
you
a
meeting
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
am
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Our
meeting
,
Haredale
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
tapping
his
snuff
-
box
,
and
following
with
a
smile
the
impatient
gesture
he
had
made
---
 
perhaps
unconsciously
---
towards
his
sword
,
"
is
one
of
conference
and
peace
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
here
,
"
returned
the
other
,
"
at
your
desire
,
holding
myself
bound
to
meet
you
,
when
and
where
you
would
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
come
to
bandy
pleasant
speeches
,
or
hollow
professions
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
a
smooth
man
of
the
world
,
sir
,
and
at
such
play
have
me
at
a
disadvantage
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
last
man
on
this
earth
with
whom
I
would
enter
the
lists
to
combat
with
gentle
compliments
and
masked
faces
,
is
Mr
Chester
,
I
do
assure
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
his
match
at
such
weapons
,
and
have
reason
to
believe
that
few
men
are
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
me
a
great
deal
of
honour
Haredale
,
"
returned
the
other
,
most
composedly
,
"
and
I
thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
be
frank
with
you
---
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
beg
your
pardon
---
will
be
what
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Frank
---
open
---
perfectly
candid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hab
!
"
cried
Mr
Haredale
,
drawing
his
breath
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
do
n't
let
me
interrupt
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
resolved
am
I
to
hold
this
course
,
"
returned
the
other
,
tasting
his
wine
with
great
deliberation
;
"
<EOS>
that
I
have
determined
not
to
quarrel
with
you
,
and
not
to
be
betrayed
into
a
warm
expression
or
a
hasty
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
again
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
"
you
have
me
at
a
great
advantage
.
<EOS>
Your
self
-
command
---
"
  
"
Is
not
to
be
disturbed
,
when
it
will
serve
my
purpose
,
you
would
say
"
---
rejoined
the
other
,
interrupting
him
with
the
same
complacency
.
 
<EOS>
"
Granted
.
 
<EOS>
I
allow
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
have
a
purpose
to
serve
now
.
 
<EOS>
So
have
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
our
object
is
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
attain
it
like
sensible
men
,
who
have
ceased
to
be
boys
some
time
.
<EOS>
---
 
<EOS>
Do
you
drink
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
With
my
friends
,
"
returned
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
At
least
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
"
you
will
be
seated
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
stand
,
"
returned
Mr
Haredale
impatiently
,
"
on
this
dismantled
,
beggared
hearth
,
and
not
pollute
it
,
fallen
as
it
is
,
with
mockeries
.
 
<EOS>
Go
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
wrong
,
Haredale
,
"
said
the
other
,
crossing
his
legs
,
and
smiling
as
he
held
his
glass
up
in
the
bright
glow
of
the
fire
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
really
very
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
The
world
is
a
lively
place
enough
,
in
which
we
must
accommodate
ourselves
to
circumstances
,
sail
with
the
stream
as
glibly
as
we
can
,
be
content
to
take
froth
for
substance
,
the
surface
for
the
depth
,
the
counterfeit
for
the
real
coin
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
no
philosopher
has
ever
established
that
our
globe
itself
is
hollow
.
 
<EOS>
It
should
be
,
if
Nature
is
consistent
in
her
works
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
YOU
think
it
is
,
perhaps
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
say
,
"
he
returned
,
sipping
his
wine
,
"
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
Well
;
we
,
in
trifling
with
this
jingling
toy
,
have
had
the
ill
-
luck
to
jostle
and
fall
out
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
not
what
the
world
calls
friends
;
but
we
are
as
good
and
true
and
loving
friends
for
all
that
,
as
nine
out
of
every
ten
of
those
on
whom
it
bestows
the
title
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
a
niece
,
and
I
a
son
---
a
fine
lad
,
Haredale
,
but
foolish
.
 
<EOS>
They
fall
in
love
with
each
other
,
and
form
what
this
same
world
calls
an
attachment
;
meaning
a
something
fanciful
and
false
like
the
rest
,
which
,
if
it
took
its
own
free
time
,
would
break
like
any
other
bubble
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
may
not
have
its
own
free
time
---
<EOS>
will
not
,
if
they
are
left
alone
---
and
the
question
is
,
shall
we
two
,
because
society
calls
us
enemies
,
stand
aloof
,
and
let
them
rush
into
each
other
's
arms
,
when
,
by
approaching
each
other
sensibly
,
as
we
do
now
,
we
can
prevent
it
,
and
part
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
love
my
niece
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
after
a
short
silence
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
may
sound
strangely
in
your
ears
;
but
I
love
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Strangely
,
my
good
fellow
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Chester
,
lazily
filling
his
glass
again
,
and
pulling
out
his
toothpick
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
like
Ned
too
---
<EOS>
or
,
as
you
say
,
love
him
<EOS>
---
that
's
the
word
among
such
near
relations
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
very
fond
of
Ned
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
an
amazingly
good
fellow
,
and
a
handsome
fellow
---
foolish
and
weak
as
yet
;
that
's
all
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
thing
is
,
Haredale
---
<EOS>
for
I
'll
be
very
frank
,
as
I
told
you
I
would
at
first
---
independently
of
any
dislike
that
you
and
I
might
have
to
being
related
to
each
other
,
and
independently
of
the
religious
differences
between
us
---
and
damn
it
,
that
's
important
<EOS>
---
I
could
n't
afford
a
match
of
this
description
.
 
<EOS>
Ned
<EOS>
and
I
could
n't
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
impossible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Curb
your
tongue
,
in
God
's
name
,
if
this
conversation
is
to
last
,
"
retorted
Mr
Haredale
fiercely
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
said
I
love
my
niece
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
think
that
,
loving
her
,
I
would
have
her
fling
her
heart
away
on
any
man
who
had
your
blood
in
his
veins
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
"
said
the
other
,
not
at
all
disturbed
,
"
the
advantage
of
being
so
frank
and
open
.
 
<EOS>
Just
what
I
was
about
to
add
,
upon
my
honour
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
amazingly
attached
to
Ned
---
<EOS>
quite
doat
upon
him
,
indeed
<EOS>
---
and
even
if
we
could
afford
to
throw
ourselves
away
,
that
very
objection
would
be
quite
insuperable
.
<EOS>
---
I
wish
you
'd
take
some
wine
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mark
me
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
striding
to
the
table
,
and
laying
his
hand
upon
it
heavily
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
any
man
believes
---
presumes
to
think
---
 
that
I
,
in
word
or
deed
,
or
in
the
wildest
dream
,
ever
entertained
remotely
the
idea
of
Emma
Haredale
's
favouring
the
suit
of
any
one
who
was
akin
to
you
---
in
any
way
---
I
care
not
<EOS>
what
---
he
lies
.
 
<EOS>
He
lies
,
and
does
me
grievous
wrong
,
in
the
mere
thought
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Haredale
,
"
returned
the
other
,
rocking
himself
to
and
fro
as
in
assent
,
and
nodding
at
the
fire
,
"
it
's
extremely
manly
,
and
really
very
generous
in
you
,
to
meet
me
in
this
unreserved
and
handsome
way
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
,
those
are
exactly
my
sentiments
,
only
expressed
with
much
more
force
and
power
than
I
could
use
---
you
know
my
sluggish
nature
,
and
will
forgive
me
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
While
I
would
restrain
her
from
all
correspondence
with
your
son
,
and
sever
their
intercourse
here
,
though
it
should
cause
her
death
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
who
had
been
pacing
to
and
fro
,
"
I
would
do
it
kindly
and
tenderly
if
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
trust
to
discharge
,
which
my
nature
is
not
formed
to
understand
,
and
,
for
this
reason
,
the
bare
fact
of
there
being
any
love
between
them
comes
upon
me
to
-
night
,
almost
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
more
delighted
than
I
can
possibly
tell
you
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Chester
with
the
utmost
blandness
,
"
to
find
my
own
impression
so
confirmed
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
the
advantage
of
our
having
met
.
 
<EOS>
We
understand
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
We
quite
agree
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
a
most
complete

thorough
explanation
,

we
know
what
course
to
take
.
<EOS>
---
Why
do
n't
you
taste
your
tenant
's
wine
?
 
<EOS>
It
's
really
very
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
who
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
"
have
aided
Emma
,
or
your
son
?
 
<EOS>
Who
are
their
go
-
betweens
,
and
agents
---
do
you
know
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
the
good
people
hereabouts
---
the
neighbourhood
in
general
,
I
think
,
"
returned
the
other
,
with
his
most
affable
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
messenger
I
sent
to
you
to
-
day
,
foremost
among
them
all
.

<EOS>
"
The
idiot

Barnaby

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
surprised
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
of
that
,
for
I
was
rather
so
myself
.
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
I
wrung
that
from
his
mother
---
a
very
decent
sort
of
woman
---
 
from
whom
,
indeed
,
I
chiefly
learnt
how
serious
the
matter
had
become
,
and
so
determined
to
ride
out
here
to
-
day
,
and
hold
a
parley
with
you
on
this
neutral
ground
.
<EOS>
---
You
're
stouter
than
you
used
to
be
,
Haredale
,
but
you
look
extremely
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Our
business
,
I
presume
,
is
nearly
at
an
end
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
with
an
expression
of
impatience
he
was
at
no
pains
to
conceal
.
<EOS>
"
Trust
me
,
Mr
Chester
,
my
niece
shall
change
from
this
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
appeal
,
"
he
added
in
a
lower
tone
,
"
to
her
woman
's
heart
,
her
dignity
,
her
pride
,
her
duty
---
"
  
"
I
shall
do
the
same
by
Ned
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
restoring
some
errant
faggots
to
their
places
in
the
grate
with
the
toe
of
his
boot
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
there
is
anything
real
in
this
world
,
it
is
those
amazingly
fine
feelings
and
those
natural
obligations
which
must
subsist
between
father
and
son
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
put
it
to
him
on
every
ground
of
moral
and
religious
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
represent
to
him
that
we
can
not
possibly
afford
it
---
that
I
have
always
looked
forward
to
his
marrying
well
,
for
a
genteel
provision
for
myself
in
the
autumn
of
life
---
that
there
are
a
great
many
clamorous
dogs
to
pay
,
whose
claims
are
perfectly
just
and
right
,
and
who
must
be
paid
out
of
his
wife
's
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
that
the
very
highest
and
most
honourable
feelings
of
our
nature
,
with
every
consideration
of
filial
duty
and
affection
,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
,
imperatively
demand
that
he
should
run
away
with
an
heiress
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
break
her
heart
as
speedily
as
possible
?
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
drawing
on
his
glove
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
Ned
will
act
exactly
as
he
pleases
,
"
returned
the
other
,
sipping
his
wine
;
"
that
's
entirely
his
affair
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
for
the
world
<EOS>
interfere
with
my
son
,
Haredale
,
beyond
a
certain
point
.
 
<EOS>
The
relationship
between
father
and
son
,
you
know
,
is
positively
quite
a
holy
kind
of
bond
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
WON'T
<EOS>
you
let
me
persuade
you
to
take
one
glass
of
wine
?
 
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
as
you
please
,
as
you
please
,
"
he
added
,
helping
himself
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Chester
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
after
a
short
silence
,
during
which
he
had
eyed
his
smiling
face
from
time
to
time
intently
,
"
you
have
the
head
and
heart
of
an
evil
spirit
in
all
matters
of
deception
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
health
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
other
,
with
a
nod
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
interrupted
you
---
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
now
,
"
pursued
Mr
Haredale
,
"
we
should
find
it
difficult
to
separate
these
young
people
,
and
break
off
their
intercourse
---
if
,
for
instance
,
you
find
it
difficult
on
your
side
,
what
course
do
you
intend
to
take
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
plainer
,
my
good
fellow
,
nothing
easier
,
"
returned
the
other
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
stretching
himself
more
comfortably
before
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
then
exert
those
powers
on
which
you
flatter
me
so
highly
---
though
,
upon
my
word
,
I
do
n't
deserve
your
compliments
to
their
full
extent
---
and
resort
to
a
few
little
trivial
subterfuges
for
rousing
jealousy
and
resentment
.
<EOS>
You
see
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
In
short
,
justifying
the
means
by
the
end
,
we
are
,
as
a
last
resource
for
tearing
them
asunder
,
to
resort
to
treachery
and
---
and
lying
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
<EOS>
no
.
 
<EOS>
Fie
,
fie
!
<EOS>
"
returned
the
other
,
relishing
a
pinch
of
snuff
extremely
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
lying
.
 
<EOS>
Only
a
little
management
,
a
little
diplomacy
,
a
little
---
intriguing
<EOS>
,
that
's
the
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
moving
to
and
fro
,
and
stopping
,
and
moving
on
again
,
like
one
who
was
ill
at
ease
,
"
that
this
could
have
been
foreseen
or
prevented
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
it
has
gone
so
far
,
and
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
act
,
it
is
of
no
use
shrinking
or
regretting
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
I
shall
second
your
endeavours
to
the
utmost
of
my
power
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
one
topic
in
the
whole
wide
range
of
human
thoughts
on
which
we
both
agree
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
act
in
concert
,
but
apart
.
 
<EOS>
There
will
be
no
need
,
I
hope
,
for
us
to
meet
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
?
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
rising
with
a
graceful
indolence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Let
me
light
you
down
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
keep
your
seat
,
"
returned
the
other
drily
,
"
I
know
the
way
.
<EOS>
So
,
waving
his
hand
slightly
,
and
putting
on
his
hat
as
he
turned
upon
his
heel
,
he
went
clanking
out
as
he
had
come
,
shut
the
door
behind
him
,
and
tramped
down
the
echoing
stairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pah
!
 
<EOS>
A
very
coarse
animal
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
composing
himself
in
the
easy
-
chair
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
rough
brute
.
 
<EOS>
Quite
a
human
badger
!
"
  
<EOS>
John
Willet
and
his
friends
,
who
had
been
listening
intently
for
the
clash
of
swords
,
or
firing
of
pistols
in
the
great
room
,
and
had
indeed
settled
the
order
in
which
they
should
rush
in
when
summoned
---
in
which
procession
old
John
had
carefully
arranged
that
he
should
bring
up
the
rear
---
were
very
much
astonished
to
see
Mr
Haredale
come
down
without
a
scratch
,
call
for
his
horse
,
and
ride
away
thoughtfully
at
a
footpace
.
 
<EOS>
After
some
consideration
,
it
was
decided
that
he
had
left
the
gentleman
above
,
for
dead
,
and
had
adopted
this
stratagem
to
divert
suspicion
or
pursuit
.
  
<EOS>
As
this
conclusion
involved
the
necessity
of
their
going
upstairs
forthwith
,
they
were
about
to
ascend
in
the
order
they
had
agreed
upon
,
when
a
smart
ringing
at
the
guest
's
bell
,
as
if
he
had
pulled
it
vigorously
,
overthrew
all
their
speculations
,
and
involved
them
in
great
uncertainty
and
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
Mr
Willet
agreed
to
go
upstairs
himself
,
escorted
by
Hugh
and
Barnaby
,
as
the
strongest
and
stoutest
fellows
on
the
premises
,
who
were
to
make
their
appearance
under
pretence
of
clearing
away
the
glasses
.
  
<EOS>
Under
this
protection
,
the
brave
and
broad
-
faced
John
boldly
entered
the
room
,
half
a
foot
in
advance
,
and
received
an
order
for
a
boot
-
jack
without
trembling
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
it
was
brought
,
and
he
leant
his
sturdy
shoulder
to
the
guest
,
Mr
Willet
was
observed
to
look
very
hard
into
his
boots
as
he
pulled
them
off
,
and
,
by
opening
his
eyes
much
wider
than
usual
,
to
appear
to
express
some
surprise
and
disappointment
at
not
finding
them
full
of
blood
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
occasion
,
too
,
to
examine
the
gentleman
as
closely
as
he
could
,
expecting
to
discover
sundry
loopholes
in
his
person
,
pierced
by
his
adversary
's
sword
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
none
,
however
,
and
observing
in
course
of
time
that
his
guest
was
as
cool
and
unruffled
,
both
in
his
dress
and
temper
,
as
he
had
been
all
day
,
old
John
at
last
heaved
a
deep
sigh
,
and
began
to
think
no
duel
had
been
fought
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
Willet
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
"
if
the
room
's
well
aired
,
I
'll
try
the
merits
of
that
famous
bed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
room
,
sir
,
"
returned
John
,
taking
up
a
candle
,
and
nudging
Barnaby
and
Hugh
to
accompany
them
,
in
case
<EOS>
the
gentleman
should
unexpectedly
drop
down
faint
or
dead
from
some
internal
wound
,
"
the
room
's
as
warm
as
any
toast
in
a
tankard
.
 
<EOS>
Barnaby
,
take
you
that
other
candle
,
and
go
on
before
.
 
<EOS>
Hugh
!
 
<EOS>
Follow
up
,
sir
,
with
the
easy
-
chair
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
In
this
order
---
and
still
,
in
his
earnest
inspection
,
holding
his
candle
very
close
to
the
guest
;
now
making
him
feel
extremely
warm
about
the
legs
,
now
threatening
to
set
his
wig
on
fire
,
and
constantly
begging
his
pardon
with
great
awkwardness
and
embarrassment
---
John
led
the
party
to
the
best
bedroom
,
which
was
nearly
as
large
as
the
chamber
from
which
they
had
come
,
and
held
,
drawn
out
near
the
fire
for
warmth
,
a
great
old
spectral
bedstead
,
hung
with
faded
brocade
,
and
ornamented
,
at
the
top
of
each
carved
post
,
with
a
plume
of
feathers
that
had
once
been
white
,
but
with
dust
and
age
had
now
grown
hearse
-
like
and
funereal
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
night
,
my
friends
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
with
a
sweet
smile
,
seating
himself
,
when
he
had
surveyed
the
room
from
end
to
end
,
in
the
easy
-
chair
which
his
attendants
wheeled
before
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
night
!
 
<EOS>
Barnaby
,
my
good
fellow
,
you
say
some
prayers
before
you
go
to
bed
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Barnaby
nodded
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
some
nonsense
that
he
calls
his
prayers
,
sir
<EOS>
,
"
returned
old
John
,
officiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid
there
an't
much
good
in
em
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
Hugh
?
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
turning
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
I
,
"
he
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
<EOS>
his
"
---
pointing
to
Barnaby
---
"
they
're
well
enough
.
 
<EOS>
He
sings
'em
sometimes
in
the
straw
.
 
<EOS>
I
listen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
quite
a
animal
,
sir
,
"
John
whispered
in
his
ear
with
dignity
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
excuse
him
,
I
'm
sure
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
has
any
soul
at
all
,
sir
,
it
must
be
such
a
very
small
one
,
that
it
do
n't
signify
what
he
does
or
does
n't
in
that
way
.
 
<EOS>
Good
night
,
sir
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
guest
rejoined
"
God
bless
you
!
"
<EOS>
with
a
fervour
that
was
quite
affecting
;
and
John
,
beckoning
his
guards
to
go
before
,
bowed
himself
out
of
the
room
,
and
left
him
to
his
rest
in
the
Maypole
's
ancient
bed
.

Chapter

<EOS>
If
Joseph
Willet
,
the
denounced
and
proscribed
of
'
prentices
,
had
happened
to
be
at
home
when
his
father
's
courtly
guest
presented
himself
before
the
Maypole
door
---
<EOS>
that
is
,
if
it
had
not
perversely
chanced
to
be
one
of
the
half
-
dozen
days
in
the
whole
year
on
which
he
was
at
liberty
to
absent
himself
for
as
many
hours
without
question
or
reproach
---
he
would
have
contrived
,
by
hook
or
crook
,
to
dive
to
the
very
bottom
of
Mr
Chester
's
mystery
,
and
to
come
at
his
purpose
with
as
much
certainty
as
though
he
had
been
his
confidential
adviser
.
 
<EOS>
In
that
fortunate
case
,
the
lovers
would
have
had
quick
warning
of
the
ills
that
threatened
them
,
and
the
aid
of
various
timely
and
wise
suggestions
to
boot
;
for
all
Joe
's
readiness
of
thought
and
action
,
and
all
his
sympathies
and
good
wishes
,
were
enlisted
in
favour
of
the
young
people
,
and
were
staunch
in
devotion
to
their
cause
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
this
disposition
arose
out
of
his
old
prepossessions
in
favour
of
the
young
lady
,
whose
history
had
surrounded
her
in
his
mind
,
almost
from
his
cradle
,
with
circumstances
of
unusual
interest
;
or
from
his
attachment
towards
the
young
gentleman
,
into
whose
confidence
he
had
,
through
his
shrewdness
and
alacrity
,
and
the
rendering
of
sundry
important
services
as
a
spy
and
messenger
,
almost
imperceptibly
glided
;
whether
they
had
their
origin
in
either
of
these
sources
,
or
in
the
habit
natural
to
youth
,
or
in
the
constant
badgering
and
worrying
of
his
venerable
parent
,
or
in
any
hidden
little
love
affair
of
his
own
which
gave
him
something
of
a
fellow
-
feeling
in
the
matter
,
it
is
needless
to
inquire
---
especially
as
Joe
was
out
of
the
way
,
and
had
no
opportunity
on
that
particular
occasion
of
testifying
to
his
sentiments
either
on
one
side
or
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
,
in
fact
,
the
twenty
-
fifth
of
March
,
which
,
as
most
people
know
to
their
cost
,
is
,
and
has
been
time
out
of
mind
,
one
of
those
unpleasant
epochs
termed
quarter
-
days
.
 
<EOS>
On
this
twenty
-
fifth
of
March
,
it
was
John
Willet
's
pride
annually
to
settle
,
in
hard
cash
,
<EOS>
his
account
with
a
certain
vintner
and
distiller
in
the
city
of
London
;
to
give
into
whose
hands
a
canvas
bag
containing
its
exact
amount
,
and
not
a
penny
more
or
less
,
was
the
end
and
object
of
a
journey
for
Joe
,
so
surely
as
the
year
and
day
came
round
.
  
<EOS>
This
journey
was
performed
upon
an
old
grey
mare
,
concerning
whom
John
had
an
indistinct
set
of
ideas
hovering
about
him
,
to
the
effect
that
she
could
win
a
plate
or
cup
if
she
tried
.
 
<EOS>
She
never
had
tried
,
and
probably
never
would
now
,
being
some
fourteen
or
fifteen
years
of
age
,
short
in
wind
,
long
in
body
,
and
rather
the
worse
for
wear
in
respect
of
her
mane
and
tail
.
 
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
these
slight
defects
,
John
perfectly
gloried
in
the
animal
;
and
when
she
was
brought
round
to
the
door
by
Hugh
,
actually
retired
into
the
bar
,
and
there
,
in
a
secret
grove
of
lemons
,
laughed
with
pride
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
bit
of
horseflesh
,
Hugh
!
"
said
John
,
when
he
had
recovered
enough
self
-
command
to
appear
at
the
door
again
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
comely
creature
!
 
<EOS>
There
's
high
mettle
!
 
<EOS>
There
's
bone

There
was
bone
enough
beyond
all
doubt
;
and
so
Hugh
seemed
to
think
,
as
he
sat
sideways
in
the
saddle
,
lazily
doubled
up
with
his
chin
nearly
touching
his
knees
;
and
heedless
of
the
dangling
stirrups
and
loose
bridle
-
rein
,
sauntered
up
and
down
on
the
little
green
before
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mind
you
take
good
care
of
her
,
sir
,
"
said
John
,
appealing
from
this
insensible
person
to
his
son
and
heir
,
who
now
appeared
,
fully
equipped
and
ready
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
ride
hard
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
puzzled
to
do
that
,
I
think
,
father
,
"
Joe
replied
,
casting
a
disconsolate
look
at
the
animal
.
  
<EOS>
"
None
of
your
impudence
,
sir
,
if
you
please
,
"
retorted
old
John
.
<EOS>
"
What
would
you
ride
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
A
wild
ass
or
zebra
would
be
too
tame
for
you
,
would
n't
he
,
eh
sir
?
 
<EOS>
You
'd
like
to
ride
a
roaring
lion
,
<EOS>
would
n't
you
,
sir
,
eh
sir
?
 
<EOS>
Hold
your
tongue
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
When
Mr
Willet
,
in
his
differences
with
his
son
,
had
exhausted
all
the
questions
that
occurred
to
him
,
and
Joe
had
said
nothing
at
all
in
answer
,
he
generally
wound
up
by
bidding
him
hold
his
tongue
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
does
the
boy
mean
,
"
added
Mr
Willet
,
after
he
had
stared
at
him
for
a
little
time
,
in
a
species
of
stupefaction
,
"
by
cocking
his
hat
,
to
such
an
extent
!
 
<EOS>
Are
you
going
to
kill
the
wintner
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Joe
,
tartly
;
"
I
'm
not
.
 
<EOS>
Now
your
mind
's
at
ease
,
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
With
a
milintary
air
,
too
!
"
said
Mr
Willet
,
surveying
him
from
top
to
toe
;
"
with
a
swaggering
,
fire
-
eating
,
biling
-
water
drinking
sort
of
way
with
him
!
 
<EOS>
And
what
do
you
mean
by
pulling
up
the
crocuses
and
snowdrops
,
eh
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
only
a
little
nosegay
,
"
said
Joe
,
reddening
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
harm
in
that
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
boy
of
business
,
you
are
,
sir
!
"
said
Mr
Willet
,
disdainfully
,
"
to
go
supposing
that
wintners
care
for
nosegays
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
suppose
anything
of
the
kind
,
"
returned
Joe
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
them
keep
their
red
noses
for
bottles
and
tankards
.
 
<EOS>
These
are
going
to
Mr
Varden
's
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
do
you
suppose
HE
minds
such
things
as
crocuses
?
"
demanded
John
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
and
to
say
the
truth
,
I
do
n't
care
,
"
said
Joe
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
father
,
give
me
the
money
,
and
in
the
name
of
patience
let
me
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
it
is
,
sir
,
"
replied
John
;
"
and
take
care
of
it
;
and
mind
you
do
n't
make
too
much
haste
back
,
but
give
the
mare
a
long
rest
.
<EOS>
---
 
<EOS>
Do
you
mind
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
I
mind
,
"
returned
Joe
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
'll
need
it
,
Heaven
knows
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
do
n't
you
score
up
too
much
at
the
Black
Lion
,
"
said
John
.
<EOS>
"
Mind
that
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
why
do
n't
you
let
me
have
some
money
of
my
own
?
"
<EOS>
retorted
Joe
,
sorrowfully
;
"
<EOS>
why
do
n't
you
,
father
?
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
send
me
into
London
for
,
giving
me
only
the
right
to
call
for
my
dinner
at
the
Black
Lion
,
which
you
're
to
pay
for
next
time
you
go
,
as
if
I
was
not
to
be
trusted
with
a
few
shillings
?
 
<EOS>
Why
do
you
use
me
like
this
?
 
<EOS>
It
's
not
right
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
expect
me
to
be
quiet
under
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
him
have
money
!
"
<EOS>
cried
John
,
in
a
drowsy
reverie
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
does
he
call
money
---
guineas
?
 
<EOS>
Has
n't
he
got
money
?
 
<EOS>
Over
and
above
the
tolls
,
has
n't
he
one
and
sixpence
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
One
and
sixpence
!
"
repeated
his
son
contemptuously
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
returned
John
,
"
one
and
sixpence
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
was
your
age
,
I
had
never
seen
so
much
money
,
in
a
heap
.
 
<EOS>
A
shilling
of
it
is
in
case
of
accidents
---
the
mare
casting
a
shoe
,
or
the
like
of
that
.
<EOS>
The
other
sixpence
is
to
spend
in
the
diversions
of
London
;
and
the
diversion
I
recommend
is
going
to
the
top
of
the
Monument
,
and
sitting
there
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
no
temptation
there
,
sir
---
no
drink
---
<EOS>
no
young
women
---
no
bad
characters
of
any
sort
---
nothing
but
imagination
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
way
I
enjoyed
myself
when
I
was
your
age
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
To
this
,
Joe
made
no
answer
,
but
beckoning
Hugh
,
leaped
into
the
saddle
and
rode
away
;
and
a
very
stalwart
,
manly
horseman
he
looked
,
deserving
a
better
charger
than
it
was
his
fortune
to
bestride
.
 
<EOS>
John
stood
staring
after
him
,
or
rather
after
the
grey
mare
(
for
he
had
no
eyes
for
her
rider
)
,
until
man
and
beast
had
been
out
of
sight
some
twenty
minutes
,
when
he
began
to
think
they
were
gone
,
and
slowly
re
-
entering
the
house
,
fell
into
a
gentle
doze
.
  
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
grey
mare
,
who
was
the
agony
of
Joe
's
life
,
floundered
along
at
her
own
will
and
pleasure
until
the
Maypole
was
no
longer
visible
,
and
then
,
contracting
her
legs
into
what
in
a
puppet
would
have
been
looked
upon
as
a
clumsy
and
awkward
imitation
of
a
canter
,
mended
her
pace
all
at
once
,
and
did
it
of
her
own
accord
.
 
<EOS>
The
acquaintance
with
her
rider
's
usual
mode
of
proceeding
,
which
suggested
this
improvement
in
hers
,
impelled
her
likewise
to
turn
up
a
bye
-
way
,
leading
---
not
to
London
,
but
through
lanes
running
parallel
with
the
road
they
had
come
,
and
passing
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
the
Maypole
,
which
led
finally
to
an
inclosure
surrounding
a
large
,
old
,
red
-
brick
mansion
---
the
same
of
which
mention
was
made
as
the
Warren
in
the
first
chapter
of
this
history
.
 
<EOS>
Coming
to
a
dead
stop
in
a
little
copse
thereabout
,
she
suffered
her
rider
to
dismount
with
right
goodwill
,
and
to
tie
her
to
the
trunk
of
a
tree
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stay
there
,
old
girl
,
"
said
Joe
,
"
and
let
us
see
whether
there
's
any
little
commission
for
me
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
left
her
to
browze
upon
such
stunted
grass
and
weeds
as
happened
to
grow
within
the
length
of
her
tether
,
and
passing
through
a
wicket
gate
,
entered
the
grounds
on
foot
.
  
<EOS>
The
pathway
,
after
a
very
few
minutes
'
walking
,
brought
him
close
to
the
house
,
towards
which
,
and
especially
towards
one
particular
window
,
he
directed
many
covert
glances
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
dreary
,
silent
building
,
with
echoing
courtyards
,
desolated
turret
-
chambers
,
and
whole
suites
of
rooms
shut
up
and
mouldering
to
ruin
.
  
<EOS>
The
terrace
-
garden
,
dark
with
the
shade
of
overhanging
trees
,
had
an
air
of
melancholy
that
was
quite
oppressive
.
 
<EOS>
Great
iron
gates
,
disused
for
many
years
,
and
red
with
rust
,
drooping
on
their
hinges
and
overgrown
with
long
rank
grass
,
seemed
as
though
they
tried
to
sink
into
the
ground
,
and
hide
their
fallen
state
among
the
friendly
weeds
.
 
<EOS>
The
fantastic
monsters
on
the
walls
,
green
with
age
and
damp
,
and
covered
here
and
there
with
moss
,
looked
grim
and
desolate
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
sombre
aspect
even
on
that
part
of
the
mansion
which
was
inhabited
and
kept
in
good
repair
,
that
struck
the
beholder
with
a
sense
of
sadness
;
of
something
forlorn
and
failing
,
whence
cheerfulness
was
banished
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
difficult
to
imagine
a
bright
fire
blazing
in
the
dull
and
darkened
rooms
,
or
to
picture
any
gaiety
of
heart
or
revelry
that
the
frowning
walls
shut
in
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
a
place
where
such
things
had
been
,
but
could
be
no
more
---
the
very
ghost
of
a
house
,
haunting
the
old
spot
in
its
old
outward
form
,
and
that
was
all
.
  
<EOS>
Much
of
this
decayed
and
sombre
look
was
attributable
,
no
doubt
,
to
the
death
of
its
former
master
,
and
the
temper
of
its
present
occupant
;
but
remembering
the
tale
connected
with
the
mansion
<EOS>
,
it
seemed
the
very
place
for
such
a
deed
,
and
one
that
might
have
been
its
predestined
theatre
years
upon
years
ago
.
 
<EOS>
Viewed
with
reference
to
this
legend
,
the
sheet
of
water
where
the
steward
's
body
had
been
found
appeared
to
wear
a
black
and
sullen
character
,
such
as
no
other
pool
might
own
;
the
bell
upon
the
roof
that
had
told
the
tale
of
murder
to
the
midnight
wind
,
became
a
very
phantom
whose
voice
would
raise
the
listener
's
hair
on
end
;
and
every
leafless
bough
that
nodded
to
another
,
had
its
stealthy
whispering
of
the
crime
.
  
<EOS>
Joe
paced
up
and
down
the
path
,
sometimes
stopping
in
affected
contemplation
of
the
building
or
the
prospect
,
sometimes
leaning
against
a
tree
with
an
assumed
air
of
idleness
and
indifference
,
but
always
keeping
an
eye
upon
the
window
he
had
singled
out
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
After
some
quarter
of
an
hour
's
delay
,
a
small
white
hand
was
waved
to
him
for
an
instant
from
this
casement
,
and
the
young
man
,
with
a
respectful
bow
,
departed
;
saying
under
his
breath
as
he
crossed
his
horse
again
,
"
No
errand
for
me
to
-
day
!
"
  
<EOS>
But
the
air
of
smartness
,
the
cock
of
the
hat
to
which
John
Willet
had
objected
,
and
the
spring
nosegay
,
all
betokened
some
little
errand
of
his
own
,
having
a
more
interesting
object
than
a
vintner
or
even
a
locksmith
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
indeed
,
it
turned
out
;
for
when
he
had
settled
with
the
vintner
---
whose
place
of
business
was
down
in
some
deep
cellars
hard
by
Thames
Street
,
and
who
was
as
purple
-
faced
an
old
gentleman
as
if
he
had
all
his
life
supported
their
arched
roof
on
his
head
---
when
he
had
settled
the
account
,
and
taken
the
receipt
,
and
declined
tasting
more
than
three
glasses
of
old
sherry
,
to
the
unbounded
astonishment
of
the
purple
-
faced
vintner
,
who
,
gimlet
in
hand
,
had
projected
an
attack
upon
at
least
a
score
of
dusty
casks
,
and
who
stood
transfixed
,
or
morally
gimleted
as
it
were
,
to
his
own
wall
---
when
he
had
done
all
this
,
and
disposed
besides
of
a
frugal
dinner
at
the
Black
Lion
in
Whitechapel
;
spurning
the
Monument
and
John
's
advice
,
he
turned
his
steps
towards
the
locksmith
's
house
,
attracted
by
the
eyes
of
blooming
Dolly
Varden
.
  
<EOS>
Joe
was
by
no
means
a
sheepish
fellow
,
but
,
for
all
that
,
when
he
got
to
the
corner
of
the
street
in
which
the
locksmith
lived
,
he
could
by
no
means
make
up
his
mind
to
walk
straight
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
First
,
he
resolved
to
stroll
up
another
street
for
five
minutes
,
then
up
another
street
for
five
minutes
more
,
and
so
on
until
he
had
lost
full
half
an
hour
,
when
he
made
a
bold
plunge
and
found
himself
with
a
red
face
and
a
beating
heart
in
the
smoky
workshop
.
  
<EOS>
"
Joe
Willet
,
or
his
ghost
?
"
said
Varden
,
rising
from
the
desk
at
which
he
was
busy
with
his
books
,
and
looking
at
him
under
his
spectacles
.
 
<EOS>
"
Which
is
it
?
 
<EOS>
Joe
in
the
flesh
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
That
's
hearty
.
<EOS>
And
how
are
all
the
Chigwell
company
,
Joe
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Much
as
usual
,
sir
---
they
and
I
agree
as
well
as
ever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
!
"
said
the
locksmith
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
must
be
patient
,
Joe
,
and
bear
with
old
folks
'
foibles
.
 
<EOS>
How
's
the
mare
,
Joe
?
 
<EOS>
Does
she
do
the
four
miles
an
hour
as
easily
as
ever
?
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
Does
she
,
Joe
?
 
<EOS>
Eh

<EOS>
---
<EOS>
What
have
we
there
,
Joe
---
a
nosegay
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
very
poor
one
<EOS>
,
sir
---
I
thought
Miss
Dolly
---
"
  
"
No
,
no

"
said
Gabriel
,
dropping
his
voice
,
and
shaking
his
head
,
"
not
Dolly
.
 
<EOS>
Give
'em
to
her
mother
,
Joe

<EOS>
A
great
deal
better
give
'em
to
her
mother

<EOS>
Would
you
mind
giving
'em
to
Mrs
Varden
,
Joe

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
sir
,
"
Joe
replied
,
and
endeavouring
,
but
not
with
the
greatest
possible
success
,
to
hide
his
disappointment
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
very
glad
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
right

"
said
the
locksmith
,
patting
him
on
the
back
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
do
n't
matter
who
has
'em
,
Joe
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
bit

---
Dear
heart
,
how
the
words
stuck
in
his
throat
!
  
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
"
said
Gabriel
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
been
called
to
tea
.
 
<EOS>
She
's
in
the
parlour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
,
"
thought
Joe
.
 
<EOS>
"
Which
of
'em
I
wonder
---
<EOS>
Mrs
or
Miss
?
"
 
<EOS>
The
locksmith
settled
the
doubt
as
neatly
as
if
it
had
been
expressed
aloud
,
by
leading
him
to
the
door
,
and
saying
,
"
Martha
,
my
dear
,
here
's
young
Mr
Willet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Now
,
Mrs
Varden
,
regarding
the
Maypole
as
a
sort
of
human
mantrap
,
or
decoy
for
husbands
;
viewing
its
proprietor
,
and
all
who
aided
and
abetted
him
,
in
the
light
of
so
many
poachers
among
Christian
men
;
and
believing
,
moreover
,
that
the
publicans
coupled
with
sinners
in
Holy
Writ
were
veritable
licensed
victuallers
;
was
far
from
being
favourably
disposed
towards
her
visitor
.
 
<EOS>
Wherefore
<EOS>
she
was
taken
faint
directly
;
and
being
duly
presented
with
the
crocuses
and
snowdrops
,
divined
on
further
consideration
that
they
were
the
occasion
of
the
languor
which
had
seized
upon
her
spirits
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid
I
could
n't
bear
the
room
another
minute
,
"
said
the
good
lady
,
"
if
they
remained
here
.
 
<EOS>
WOULD
you
excuse
my
putting
them
out
of
window
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Joe
begged
she
would
n't
mention
it
on
any
account
,
and
smiled
feebly
as
he
saw
them
deposited
on
the
sill
outside
.
 
<EOS>
If
anybody
could
have
known
the
pains
he
had
taken
to
make
up
that
despised
and
misused
bunch
of
flowers
!
<EOS>
---
   
<EOS>
"
I
feel
it
quite
a
relief
to
get
rid
of
them
,
I
assure
you
,
"
said
Mrs
Varden
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
better
already
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
indeed
she
did
appear
to
have
plucked
up
her
spirits
.
  
<EOS>
Joe
expressed
his
gratitude
to
Providence
for
this
favourable
dispensation
,
and
tried
to
look
as
if
he
did
n't
wonder
where
Dolly
was
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
sad
people
at
Chigwell
,
Mr
Joseph
,
"
said
Mrs
V.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
ma'am
,
"
returned
Joe
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
the
cruellest
and
most
inconsiderate
people
in
the
world
,
"
said
Mrs
Varden
,
bridling
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
old
Mr
Willet
,
having
been
a
married
man
himself
,
does
n't
know
better
than
to
conduct
himself
as
he
does
.
 
<EOS>
His
doing
it
for
profit
is
no
excuse
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
rather
pay
the
money
twenty
times
over
,
and
have
Varden
come
home
like
a
respectable
and
sober
tradesman
.
 
<EOS>
If
there
is
one
character
,
"
said
Mrs
Varden
with
great
emphasis
,
"
that
offends
and
disgusts
me
more
than
another
,
it
is
a
sot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Martha
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
locksmith
cheerily
,
"
let
us
have
tea
,
and
do
n't
let
us
talk
about
sots
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
none
here
,
and
Joe
do
n't
want
to
hear
about
them
,
I
dare
say
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
this
crisis
,
Miggs
appeared
with
toast
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
he
does
not
,
"
said
Mrs
Varden
;
"
<EOS>
and
I
dare
say
you
do
not
,
Varden
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
very
unpleasant
subiect
<EOS>
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
though
I
wo
n't
say
it
's
personal
"
---
Miggs
coughed
---
"
whatever
I
may
be
forced
to
think
"
---
<EOS>
Miggs
sneezed
expressively
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
never
will
know
,
Varden
,
and
nobody
at
young
Mr
Willet
's
age
<EOS>
---
you
'll
excuse
me
,
sir
---
can
be
expected
to
know
,
what
a
woman
suffers
when
she
is
waiting
at
home
under
such
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
do
n't
believe
me
,
as
I
know
you
do
n't
,
here
's
Miggs
,
who
is
only
too
often
a
witness
of
it
---
ask
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
she
were
very
bad
the
other
night
,
sir
,
indeed
she
were
,
said
Miggs
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
had
n't
the
sweetness
of
an
angel
in
you

mim
,
I
do
n't
think
you
could
abear
it
<EOS>
,
I
raly
do

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miggs
,
"
said
Mrs
Varden
,
"
you
're
profane
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Begging
your
pardon
,
mim
,
"
returned
Miggs
,
with
shrill
rapidity
,
"
<EOS>
such
was
not
my
intentions
,
and
such
I
hope
is
not
my
character
,
though
I
am
but
a
servant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Answering
me
,
Miggs
,
and
providing
yourself
,
"
retorted
her
mistress
,
looking
round
with
dignity
,
"
is
one
and
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
How
dare
you
speak
of
angels
in
connection
with
your
sinful
fellow
-
beings

mere
"
---
said
Mrs
Varden
,
glancing
at
herself
in
a
neighbouring
mirror
,
and
arranging
the
ribbon
of
her
cap
in
a
more
becoming
fashion
---
"
mere
worms
and
grovellers
as
we
are
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
intend
,
mim
,
if
you
please
,
to
give
offence
,
"
said
Miggs
,
confident
in
the
strength
of
her
compliment
,
and
developing
strongly
in
the
throat
as
usual
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
did
not
expect
it
would
be
took
as
such
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
<EOS>
I
know
my
own
unworthiness
,
and
that
I
hate
and
despise
myself
and
all
my
fellow
-
creatures
as
every
practicable
Christian
should
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
have
the
goodness
,
if
you
please
,
"
said
Mrs
Varden
,
loftily
,
"
to
step
upstairs
and
see
if
Dolly
has
finished
dressing
,
and
to
tell
her
that
the
chair
that
was
ordered
for
her
will
be
here
in
a
minute
,
and
that
if
she
keeps
it
waiting
,
I
shall
send
it
away
that
instant
.
<EOS>
---
I
'm
sorry
to
see
that
you
do
n't
take
your
tea
,
Varden
,
and
that
you
do
n't
take
yours
,
Mr
Joseph
;
though
of
course
it
would
be
foolish
of
me
to
expect
that
anything
that
can
be
had
at
home
,
and
in
the
company
of
females
,
would
please
YOU
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
pronoun
was
understood
in
the
plural
sense
,
and
included
both
gentlemen
,
upon
both
of
whom
it
was
rather
hard
and
undeserved
,
for
Gabriel
had
applied
himself
to
the
meal
with
a
very
promising
appetite
,
until
it
was
spoilt
by
Mrs
Varden
herself
,
and
Joe
had
as
great
a
liking
for
the
female
society
of
the
locksmith
's
house
---
or
for
a
part
of
it
at
all
events
---
as
man
could
well
entertain
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
had
no
opportunity
to
say
anything
in
his
own
defence
,
for
at
that
moment
Dolly
herself
appeared
,
and
struck
him
quite
dumb
with
her
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
Never
had
Dolly
looked
so
handsome
as
she
did
then
,
in
all
the
glow
and
grace
of
youth
,
with
all
her
charms
increased
a
hundredfold
by
a
most
becoming
dress
,
by
a
thousand
little
coquettish
ways
which
nobody
could
assume
with
a
better
grace
,
and
all
the
sparkling
expectation
of
that
accursed
party
.
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
to
tell
how
Joe
hated
that
party
wherever
it
was
,
and
all
the
other
people
who
were
going
to
it
,
whoever
they
were
.
  
<EOS>
And
she
hardly
looked
at
him
---
<EOS>
no
,
hardly
looked
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
the
chair
was
seen
through
the
open
door
coming
blundering
into
the
workshop
,
she
actually
clapped
her
hands
and
seemed
glad
to
go
.
<EOS>
But
Joe
gave
her
his
arm
---
there
was
some
comfort
in
that
---
and
handed
her
into
it
.
 
<EOS>
To
see
her
seat
herself
inside
,
with
her
laughing
eyes
brighter
than
diamonds
,
and
her
hand
---
surely
she
had
the
prettiest
hand
in
the
world
---
on
the
ledge
of
the
open
window
,
and
her
little
finger
provokingly
and
pertly
tilted
up
,
as
if
it
wondered
why
Joe
did
n't
squeeze
or
kiss
it
!
 
<EOS>
To
think
how
well
one
or
two
of
the
modest
snowdrops
would
have
become
that
delicate
bodice
,
and
how
they
were
lying
neglected
outside
the
parlour
window
!
 
<EOS>
To
see
how
Miggs
looked
on
with
a
face
expressive
of
knowing
how
all
this
loveliness
was
got
up
,
and
of
being
in
the
secret
of
every
string
and
pin
and
hook
and
eye
,
and
of
saying
it
ai
n't
half
as
real
as
you
think
,
and
I
could
look
quite
as
well
myself
if
I
took
the
pains
!
 
<EOS>
To
hear
that
provoking
precious
little
scream
when
the
chair
was
hoisted
on
its
poles
,
and
to
catch
that
transient
but
not
-
to
-
be
-
forgotten
vision
of
the
happy
face
within
---
 
what
torments
and
aggravations
,
<EOS>
and
yet
what
delights
were
these
!
<EOS>
The
very
chairmen
seemed
favoured
rivals
as
they
bore
her
down
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
There
never
was
such
an
alteration
in
a
small
room
in
a
small
time
as
in
that
parlour
when
they
went
back
to
finish
tea
.
 
<EOS>
So
dark
,
so
deserted
,
so
perfectly
disenchanted
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
such
sheer
nonsense
to
be
sitting
tamely
there
,
when
she
was
at
a
dance
with
more
lovers
than
man
could
calculate
fluttering
about
her
---
with
the
whole
party
doting
on
and
adoring
her
,
and
wanting
to
marry
her
.
<EOS>
Miggs
was
hovering
about
too
;
and
the
fact
of
her
existence
,
the
mere
circumstance
of
her
ever
having
been
born
,
appeared
,
after
Dolly
,
such
an
unaccountable
practical
joke
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
talk
.
 
<EOS>
It
could
n't
be
done
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
nothing
left
for
it
but
to
stir
his
tea
round
,
and
round
,
and
round
,
and
ruminate
on
all
the
fascinations
of
the
locksmith
's
lovely
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
Gabriel
was
dull
too
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
part
of
the
certain
uncertainty
of
Mrs
Varden
's
temper
,
that
when
they
were
in
this
condition
,
she
should
be
gay
and
sprightly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
need
have
a
cheerful
disposition
,
I
am
sure
,
"
said
the
smiling
housewife
,
"
to
preserve
any
spirits
at
all
;
and
how
I
do
it
<EOS>
I
can
scarcely
tell
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
mim
,
"
sighed
Miggs
,
"
begging
your
pardon
for
the
interruption
,
there
an't
a
many
like
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Take
away
,
Miggs
,
"
said
Mrs
Varden
,
rising
,
"
take
away
,
pray
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
<EOS>
I
'm
a
restraint
here
,
and
as
I
wish
everybody
to
enjoy
themselves
as
they
best
<EOS>
can
,
I
feel
I
had
better
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
Martha
,
"
cried
the
locksmith
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stop
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
we
shall
be
very
sorry
to
lose
you
,
eh
Joe
!
"
 
<EOS>
Joe
started
,
and
said
"
Certainly
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Varden
,
my
dear
,
"
returned
his
wife
;
"
but
I
know
your
wishes
better
.
 
<EOS>
Tobacco
and
beer
,
or
spirits
,
have
much
greater
attractions
than
any
I
can
boast
of
,
and
therefore
I
shall
go
and
sit
upstairs
and
look
out
of
window
,
my
love
.
 
<EOS>
Good
night
,
Mr
Joseph
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
very
glad
to
have
seen
you
,
and
I
only
wish
I
could
have
provided
something
more
suitable
to
your
taste
.
 
<EOS>
Remember
me
very
kindly
if
you
please
to
old
Mr
Willet
,
and
tell
him
that
whenever
he
comes
here
I
have
a
crow
to
pluck
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
Good
night
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Having
uttered
these
words
with
great
sweetness
of
manner
,
the
good
lady
dropped
a
curtsey
remarkable
for
its
condescension
,
and
serenely
withdrew
.
  
<EOS>
And
it
was
for
this
Joe
had
looked
forward
to
the
twenty
-
fifth
of
March
for
weeks
and
weeks
,
and
had
gathered
the
flowers
with
so
much
care
,
and
had
cocked
his
hat
,
and
made
himself
so
smart
!
 
<EOS>
This
was
the
end
of
all
his
bold
determination
,
resolved
upon
for
the
hundredth
time
,
to
speak
out
to
Dolly
and
tell
her
how
he
loved
her
!
 
<EOS>
To
see
her
for
a
minute
---
for
but
a
minute
---
to
find
her
going
out
to
a
party
and
glad
to
go
;
to
be
looked
upon
as
a
common
pipe
-
smoker
,
beer
-
bibber
,
spirit
-
guzzler
,
and
tosspot
!
 
<EOS>
He
bade
farewell
to
his
friend
the
locksmith
,
and
hastened
to
take
horse
at
the
Black
Lion
,
thinking
as
he
turned
towards
home
,
as
many
another
Joe
has
thought
before
and
since
,
that
here
was
an
end
to
all
his
hopes
---
that
the
thing
was
impossible
and
never
could
be
---
that
she
did
n't
care
for
him
---
that
he
was
wretched
for
life
---
and
that
the
only
congenial
prospect
left
him
,
was
to
go
for
a
soldier
or
a
sailor
,
and
get
some
obliging
enemy
to
knock
his
brains
out
as
soon
as
possible
.

Chapter
14
    
Joe
Willet
rode
leisurely
along
in
his
desponding
mood
,
picturing
the
locksmith
's
daughter
going
down
long
country
-
dances
,
and
poussetting
dreadfully
with
bold
strangers
---
which
was
almost
too
much
to
bear
---
when
he
heard
the
tramp
of
a
horse
's
feet
behind
him
,
and
looking
back
,
saw
a
well
-
mounted
gentleman
advancing
at
a
smart
canter
.
 
<EOS>
As
this
rider
passed
,
he
checked
his
steed
,
and
called
him
of
the
Maypole
by
his
name
.
 
<EOS>
Joe
set
spurs
to
the
grey
mare
,
and
was
at
his
side
directly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
it
was
you
,
sir
,
"
he
said
,
touching
his
hat
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
fair
evening
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Glad
to
see
you
out
of
doors
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
gentleman
smiled
and
nodded
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
gay
doings
have
been
going
on
to
-
day
,
Joe
?
 
<EOS>
Is
she
as
pretty
as
ever
?
 
<EOS>
Nay

do
n't
blush

man

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
coloured
at
all
,
Mr
Edward
,
"
said
Joe
,
"
which
I
did
n't
know
I
did
,
it
was
to
think
I
should
have
been
such
a
fool
as
ever
to
have
any
hope
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
's
as
far
out
of
my
reach
as
---
as
Heaven
is
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Joe
,
I
hope
that
's
not
altogether
beyond
it
,
"
said
Edward
,
good
-
humouredly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Eh
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
sighed
Joe
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
very
fine
talking
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Proverbs
are
easily
made
in
cold
blood
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
ca
n't
be
helped
.
 
<EOS>
Are
you
bound
for
our
house
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
am
not
quite
strong
yet
,
I
shall
stay
there
to
-
night
,
and
ride
home
coolly
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
're
in
no
particular
hurry
,
"
said
Joe
after
a
short
silence
,
"
and
will
bear
with
the
pace
of
this
poor
jade
,
I
shall
be
glad
to
ride
on
with
you
to
the
Warren
,
sir
,
and
hold
your
horse
when
you
dismount
.
 
<EOS>
It
'll
save
you
having
to
walk
from
the
Maypole
,
there
and
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
spare
the
time
well
,
sir
,
for
I
am
too
soon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
so
am
I
,
"
returned
Edward
,
"
though
I
was
unconsciously
riding
fast
just
now
,
in
compliment
I
suppose
to
the
pace
of
my
thoughts
,
which
were
travelling
post
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
keep
together
,
Joe
,
willingly
,
and
be
as
good
company
as
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
And
cheer
up
,
cheer
up
,
think
of
the
locksmith
's
daughter
with
a
stout
heart
,
and
you
shall
win
her
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Joe
shook
his
head
;
but
there
was
something
so
cheery
in
the
buoyant
hopeful
manner
of
this
speech
,
that
his
spirits
rose
under
its
influence
,
and
communicated
as
it
would
seem
some
new
impulse
even
to
the
grey
mare
,
who
,
breaking
from
her
sober
amble
into
a
gentle
trot
,
emulated
the
pace
of
Edward
Chester
's
horse
,
and
appeared
to
flatter
herself
that
he
was
doing
his
very
best
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
fine
dry
night
,
and
the
light
of
a
young
moon
,
which
was
then
just
rising
,
shed
around
that
peace
and
tranquillity
which
gives
to
evening
time
its
most
delicious
charm
.
 
<EOS>
The
lengthened
shadows
of
the
trees
,
softened
as
if
reflected
in
still
water
,
threw
their
carpet
on
the
path
the
travellers
pursued
,
and
the
light
wind
stirred
yet
more
softly
than
before
,
as
though
it
were
soothing
Nature
in
her
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
By
little
and
little
they
ceased
talking
,
and
rode
on
side
by
side
in
a
pleasant
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
Maypole
lights
are
brilliant
to
-
night
,
"
said
Edward
,
as
they
rode
along
the
lane
from
which
,
while
the
intervening
trees
were
bare
of
leaves
,
that
hostelry
was
visible
.
  
<EOS>
"
Brilliant
indeed
,
sir
,
"
returned
Joe
,
rising
in
his
stirrups
to
get
a
better
view
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lights
in
the
large
room
,
and
a
fire
glimmering
in
the
best
bedchamber
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
what
company
can
this
be
for
,
I
wonder
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Some
benighted
horseman
wending
towards
London
,
and
deterred
from
going
on
to
-
night
by
the
marvellous
tales
of
my
friend
the
highwayman
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Edward
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
must
be
a
horseman
of
good
quality
to
have
such
accommodations
.
<EOS>
Your
bed
too
,
sir
---
!
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
matter
,
Joe
.
 
<EOS>
Any
other
room
will
do
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
come
<EOS>
---
there
's
nine
striking
.
 
<EOS>
We
may
push
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
cantered
forward
at
as
brisk
a
pace
as
Joe
's
charger
could
attain
,
and
presently
stopped
in
the
little
copse
where
he
had
left
her
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Edward
dismounted
,
gave
his
bridle
to
his
companion
,
and
walked
with
a
light
step
towards
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
A
female
servant
was
waiting
at
a
side
gate
in
the
garden
-
wall
,
and
admitted
him
without
delay
.
 
<EOS>
He
hurried
along
the
terrace
-
walk
,
and
darted
up
a
flight
of
broad
steps
leading
into
an
old
and
gloomy
hall
,
whose
walls
were
ornamented
with
rusty
suits
of
armour
,
antlers
,
weapons
of
the
chase
,
and
suchlike
garniture
.
 
<EOS>
Here
he
paused
,
but
not
long
;
for
as
he
looked
round
,
as
if
expecting
the
attendant
to
have
followed
,
and
wondering
she
had
not
done
so
,
a
lovely
girl
appeared
,
whose
dark
hair
next
moment
rested
on
his
breast
.
 
<EOS>
Almost
at
the
same
instant
a
heavy
hand
was
laid
upon
her
arm
,
Edward
felt
himself
thrust
away
,
and
Mr
Haredale
stood
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
He
regarded
the
young
man
sternly
without
removing
his
hat
;
with
one
hand
clasped
his
niece
,
and
with
the
other
,
in
which
he
held
his
riding
-
whip
,
motioned
him
towards
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
man
drew
himself
up
,
and
returned
his
gaze
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
well
done
of
you
,
sir
,
to
corrupt
my
servants
,
and
enter
my
house
unbidden
and
in
secret
,
like
a
thief
!
"
said
Mr
Haredale
.
"
<EOS>
Leave
it
,
sir
,
and
return
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Haredale
's
presence
,
"
returned
the
young
man
,
"
and
your
relationship
to
her
,
give
you
a
licence
which
,
if
you
are
a
brave
man
,
you
will
not
abuse
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
compelled
me
to
this
course
,
and
the
fault
is
yours
---
not
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
neither
generous
,
nor
honourable
,
nor
the
act
of
a
true
man
,
sir
,
"
retorted
the
other
,
"
to
tamper
with
the
affections
of
a
weak
,
trusting
girl
,
while
you
shrink
,
in
your
unworthiness
,
from
her
guardian
and
protector
,
and
dare
not
meet
the
light
of
day
.
<EOS>
More
than
this
I
will
not
say
to
you
,
save
that
I
forbid
you
this
house
,
and
require
you
to
be
gone
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
neither
generous
,
nor
honourable
,
nor
the
act
of
a
true
man
to
play
the
spy
,
"
said
Edward
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
words
imply
dishonour
,
and
I
reject
them
with
the
scorn
they
merit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
find
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
calmly
,
"
your
trusty
go
-
between
in
waiting
at
the
gate
by
which
you
entered
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
played
no
spy
's
part
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
chanced
to
see
you
pass
the
gate
,
and
followed
.
 
<EOS>
You
might
have
heard
me
knocking
for
admission
,
had
you
been
less
swift
of
foot
,
or
lingered
in
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
Please
to
withdraw
.
 
<EOS>
Your
presence
here
is
offensive
to
me
and
distressful
to
my
niece
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
said
these
words
,
he
passed
his
arm
about
the
waist
of
the
terrified
and
weeping
girl
,
and
drew
her
closer
to
him
;
and
though
the
habitual
severity
of
his
manner
was
scarcely
changed
,
there
was
yet
apparent
in
the
action
<EOS>
an
air
of
kindness
and
sympathy
for
her
distress
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Haredale
,
"
said
Edward
,
"
your
arm
encircles
her
on
whom
I
have
set
my
every
hope
and
thought
,
and
to
purchase
one
minute
's
happiness
for
whom
I
would
gladly
lay
down
my
life
;
this
house
is
the
casket
that
holds
the
precious
jewel
of
my
existence
.
 
<EOS>
Your
niece
has
plighted
her
faith
to
me
,
and
I
have
plighted
mine
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
What
have
I
done
that
you
should
hold
me
in
this
light
esteem
,
and
give
me
these
discourteous
words
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
done
that
,
sir
,
"
answered
Mr
Haredale
,
"
which
must
he
undone
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
tied
a
lover'-knot
here
which
must
be
cut
asunder

<EOS>
Take
good
heed
of
what
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
Must

<EOS>
I
cancel
the
bond
between
ye

<EOS>
I
reject
you

your
kith

all
the
false

hollow

heartless
stock

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
High
words
,
sir
,
"
said
Edward
,
scornfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
Words
of
purpose
and
meaning
,
as
you
will
find
,
"
replied
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lay
them
to
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lay
you
then
,
these
,
"
said
Edward
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
cold
and
sullen
temper
,
which
chills
every
breast
about
you
,
which
turns
affection
into
fear
,
and
changes
duty
into
dread
,
has
forced
us
on
this
secret
course
,
repugnant
to
our
nature
and
our
wish
,
and
far
more
foreign
,
sir
,
to
us
than
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
a
false
,
a
hollow
,
or
a
heartless
man
;
the
character
is
yours
,
who
poorly
venture
on
these
injurious
terms
,
against
the
truth
,
and
under
the
shelter
whereof
I
reminded
you
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
not
cancel
the
bond
between
us

<EOS>
I
will
not
abandon
this
pursuit

<EOS>
I
rely
upon
your
niece
's
truth

honour
,
and
set
your
influence
at
nought
.
 
<EOS>
I
leave
her
with
a
confidence
in
her
pure
faith
,
which
you
will
never
weaken
,
and
with
no
concern
but
that
I
do
not
leave
her
in
some
gentler
care
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
,
he
pressed
her
cold
hand
to
his
lips
,
and
once
more
encountering
and
returning
Mr
Haredale
's
steady
look
,
withdrew
.
  
<EOS>
A
few
words
to
Joe
as
he
mounted
his
horse
sufficiently
explained
what
had
passed
,
and
renewed
all
that
young
gentleman
's
despondency
with
tenfold
aggravation
.
 
<EOS>
They
rode
back
to
the
Maypole
without
exchanging
a
syllable
,
and
arrived
at
the
door
with
heavy
hearts
.
  
<EOS>
Old
John
,
who
had
peeped
from
behind
the
red
curtain
as
they
rode
up
shouting
for
Hugh
,
was
out
directly
,
and
said
with
great
importance
as
he
held
the
young
man
's
stirrup
,
  
<EOS>
"
He

comfortable

<EOS>
"
Who

said
Edward
carelessly
,
as
he
dismounted
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your

replied
John

"

said
Edward
,
looking
with
a
mixture
of
alarm
and
doubt
,
at
Joe
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
DO
you
mean
?
"
said
Joe
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't

<EOS>
"
Why

did

know

said
John
,
opening
his
eyes
wide
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
very
singular
!
 
<EOS>
Bless
you
,
he
's
been
here
ever
since
noon
to

day
,
and
Mr
Haredale
has
been
having
a
long
talk
with

and
has

been
gone
an

<EOS>
"
My

<EOS>
"
Yes

told
me
so

slim

upright

in

<EOS>
In

up
yonder

<EOS>
No

you
can
go
in

said
John
,
walking
backwards
into
the
road
and
looking
up
at
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
n't
put
out
his
candles
yet

,
I

"
  
<EOS>
Edward
glanced
at
the
window
also
,
and
hastily
murmuring
that
he
had
changed
his
mind
---
forgotten
something
---
and
must
return
to
London
,
mounted
his
horse
again
and
rode
away
;
leaving
the
Willets
,
father
and
son
,
looking
at
each
other
in
mute
astonishment

Chapter
15
    
<EOS>
At
noon
next
day
,
John
Willet
's
guest
sat
lingering
over
his
breakfast
in
his
own
home
,
surrounded
by
a
variety
of
comforts
,
which
left
the
Maypole
's
highest
flight
and
utmost
stretch
of
accommodation
at
an
infinite
distance
behind
,
and
suggested
comparisons
very
much
to
the
disadvantage
and
disfavour
of
that
venerable
tavern
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
broad
old
-
fashioned
window
-
seat
---
as
capacious
as
many
modern
sofas
,
and
cushioned
to
serve
the
purpose
of
a
luxurious
settee
---
in
the
broad
old
-
fashioned
window
-
seat
of
a
roomy
chamber
,
Mr
Chester
lounged
,
very
much
at
his
ease
,
over
a
well
-
furnished
breakfast
-
table
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
exchanged
his
riding
-
coat
for
a
handsome
morning
-
gown
,
his
boots
for
slippers
;
had
been
at
great
pains
to
atone
for
the
having
been
obliged
to
make
his
toilet
when
he
rose
without
the
aid
of
dressing
-
case
and
tiring
equipage
;
and
,
having
gradually
forgotten
through
these
means
the
discomforts
of
an
indifferent
night
and
an
early
ride
,
was
in
a
state
of
perfect
complacency
,
indolence
,
and
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
The
situation
in
which
he
found
himself
,
indeed
,
was
particularly
favourable
to
the
growth
of
these
feelings
;
for
,
not
to
mention
the
lazy
influence
of
a
late
and
lonely
breakfast
,
with
the
additional
sedative
of
a
newspaper
<EOS>
,
there
was
an
air
of
repose
about
his
place
of
residence
peculiar
to
itself
,
and
which
hangs
about
it
,
even
in
these
times
,
when
it
is
more
bustling
and
busy
than
it
was
in
days
of
yore
.
  
<EOS>
There
are
,
still
,
worse
places
than
the
Temple
,
on
a
sultry
day
,
for
basking
in
the
sun
,
or
resting
idly
in
the
shade
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
yet
a
drowsiness
in
its
courts
,
and
a
dreamy
dulness
in
its
trees
and
gardens
;
those
who
pace
its
lanes
and
squares
may
yet
hear
the
echoes
of
their
footsteps
on
the
sounding
stones
,
and
read
upon
its
gates
,
in
passing
from
the
tumult
of
the
Strand
or
Fleet
Street
,
"
Who
enters
here
leaves
noise
behind
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
There
is
still
the
plash
of
falling
water
in
fair
Fountain
Court
,
and
there
are
yet
nooks
and
corners
where
dun
-
haunted
students
may
look
down
from
their
dusty
garrets
,
on
a
vagrant
ray
of
sunlight
patching
the
shade
of
the
tall
houses
,
and
seldom
troubled
to
reflect
a
passing
stranger
's
form
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
yet
,
in
the
Temple
,
something
of
a
clerkly
monkish
atmosphere
,
which
public
offices
of
law
have
not
disturbed
,
and
even
legal
firms
have
failed
to
scare
away
.
 
<EOS>
In
summer
time
,
its
pumps
suggest
to
thirsty
idlers
,
springs
cooler
,
and
more
sparkling
,
and
deeper
than
other
wells
;
and
as
they
trace
the
spillings
of
full
pitchers
on
the
heated
ground
,
they
snuff
the
freshness
,
and
,
sighing
,
cast
sad
looks
towards
the
Thames
,
and
think
of
baths
and
boats
,
and
saunter
on
,
despondent
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
in
a
room
in
Paper
Buildings
---
a
row
of
goodly
tenements
,
shaded
in
front
by
ancient
trees
,
and
looking
,
at
the
back
,
upon
the
Temple
Gardens
---
that
this
,
our
idler
,
lounged
;
now
taking
up
again
the
paper
he
had
laid
down
a
hundred
times
;
now
trifling
with
the
fragments
of
his
meal
;
now
pulling
forth
his
golden
toothpick
,
and
glancing
leisurely
about
the
room
,
or
out
at
window
into
the
trim
garden
walks
,
where
a
few
early
loiterers
were
already
pacing
to
and
fro
.
 
<EOS>
Here
a
pair
of
lovers
met
to
quarrel
and
make
up
;
there
a
dark
-
eyed
nursery
-
maid
had
better
eyes
for
Templars
than
her
charge
;
on
this
hand
an
ancient
spinster
,
with
her
lapdog
in
a
string
,
regarded
both
enormities
with
scornful
sidelong
looks
;
on
that
a
weazen
old
gentleman
,
ogling
the
nursery
-
maid
,
looked
with
like
scorn
upon
the
spinster
,
and
wondered
she
did
n't
know
she
was
no
longer
young
.
 
<EOS>
Apart
from
all
these
,
on
the
river
's
margin
two
or
three
couple
of
business
-
talkers
walked
slowly
up
and
down
in
earnest
conversation
;
and
one
young
man
sat
thoughtfully
on
a
bench
,
alone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ned
is
amazingly
patient
!
"
<EOS>
said
Mr
Chester
,
glancing
at
this
last
-
named
person
as
he
set
down
his
teacup
and
plied
the
golden
toothpick
,
"
immensely
patient
!
 
<EOS>
He
was
sitting
yonder
when
I
began
to
dress
,
and
has
scarcely
changed
his
posture
since
.
 
<EOS>
A
most
eccentric
dog
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
the
figure
rose
,
and
came
towards
him
with
a
rapid
pace
.
  
<EOS>
"
Really
,
as
if
he
had
heard
me
,
"
said
the
father
,
resuming
his
newspaper
with
a
yawn
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dear
Ned
!
"
  
<EOS>
Presently
the
room
-
door
opened
,
and
the
young
man
entered
;
to
whom
his
father
gently
waved
his
hand
,
and
smiled
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
at
leisure
for
a
little
conversation
,
sir
?
"
said
Edward
.
  
<EOS>
"
Surely
,
Ned
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
always
at
leisure
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
my
constitution
.
<EOS>
---
 
<EOS>
Have
you
breakfasted
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Three
hours
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
very
early
dog
!
"
cried
his
father
,
contemplating
him
from
behind
the
toothpick
,
with
a
languid
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
truth
is
,
"
said
Edward
,
bringing
a
chair
forward
,
and
seating
himself
near
the
table
,
"
that
I
slept
but
<EOS>
ill
last
night
,
and
was
glad
to
rise
.
 
<EOS>
The
cause
of
my
uneasiness
can
not
but
be
known
to
you
,
sir
;
and
it
is
upon
that
I
wish
to
speak
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
boy
,
"
returned
his
father
,
"
confide
in
me
,
I
beg
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
know
my
constitution
---
do
n't
be
prosy
,
Ned
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
plain
,
and
brief
,
"
said
Edward
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
say
you
will
,
my
good
fellow
,
"
returned
his
father
,
crossing
his
legs
,
"
or
you
certainly
will
not
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
going
to
tell
me
"
---
   
<EOS>
"
Plainly
this
,
then
,
"
said
the
son
,
with
an
air
of
great
concern
,
"
that
I
know
where
you
were
last
night
---
from
being
on
the
spot
,
indeed
---
and
whom
you
saw
,
and
what
your
purpose
was
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
say
so
!
"
cried
his
father
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
delighted
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
It
saves
us
the
worry
,
and
terrible
wear
and
tear
of
a
long
explanation
,
and
is
a
great
relief
for
both
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
very
house
!
<EOS>
Why
did
n't
you
come
up
?
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
been
charmed
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
knew
that
what
I
had
to
say
would
be
better
said
after
a
night
's
reflection
,
when
both
of
us
were
cool
,
"
returned
the
son
.
  
<EOS>
"
'
Fore
Gad
,
Ned
,
"
rejoined
the
father
,
"
<EOS>
I
was
cool
enough
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
That
detestable
Maypole
!
 
<EOS>
By
some
infernal
contrivance
of
the
builder
,
it
holds
the
wind
,
and
keeps
it
fresh
.
 
<EOS>
You
remember
the
sharp
east
wind
that
blew
so
hard
five
weeks
ago
?
 
<EOS>
I
give
you
my
honour
<EOS>
it
was
rampant
in
that
old
house
last
night
,
though
out
of
doors
there
was
a
dead
calm
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
were
saying
"
---
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
about
to
say
,
Heaven
knows
how
seriously
and
earnestly
,
that
you
have
made
me
wretched
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
hear
me
gravely
for
a
moment
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Ned
,
"
said
his
father
,
"
I
will
hear
you
with
the
patience
of
an
anchorite
.
 
<EOS>
Oblige
me
with
the
milk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
saw
Miss
Haredale
last
night
,
"
Edward
resumed
,
when
he
had
complied
with
this
request
;
"
her
uncle
,
in
her
presence
,
immediately
after
your
interview
,
and
,
as
of
course
I
know
,
in
consequence
of
it
,
forbade
me
the
house
,
and
,
with
circumstances
of
indignity
which
are
of
your
creation
<EOS>
I
am
sure
,
commanded
me
to
leave
it
on
the
instant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
his
manner
of
doing
so
,
I
give
you
my
honour
,
Ned
,
I
am
not
accountable
,
"
said
his
father
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
you
must
excuse
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
mere
boor
,
a
log
,
a
brute
,
with
no
address
in
life
.
<EOS>
---
Positively
a
fly
in
the
jug
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
I
have
seen
this
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Edward
rose
,
and
paced
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
His
imperturbable
parent
sipped
his
tea
.
  
<EOS>
"
Father
,
"
said
the
young
man
,
stopping
at
length
before
him
,
"
we
must
not
trifle
in
this
matter
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
not
deceive
each
other
,
or
ourselves
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
pursue
the
manly
open
part
I
wish
to
take
,
and
do
not
repel
me
by
this
unkind
indifference
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whether
I
am
indifferent
or
no
,
"
returned
the
other
,
"
<EOS>
I
leave
you
,
my
dear
boy
,
to
judge
.
 
<EOS>
A
ride
of
twenty
-
five
or
thirty
miles
,
through
miry
roads
---
a
Maypole
dinner
---
a
tete
-
a
-
tete
with
Haredale
,
which
,
vanity
apart
,
was
quite
a
Valentine
and
Orson
business
---
a
Maypole
bed
---
a
Maypole
landlord
,
and
a
Maypole
retinue
of
idiots
and
centaurs
;
---
<EOS>
whether
the
voluntary
endurance
of
these
things
looks
like
indifference
,
dear
Ned
,
or
like
the
excessive
anxiety
,
and
devotion
,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
,
of
a
parent
,
you
shall
determine
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
to
consider
,
sir
,
"
said
Edward
,
"
in
what
a
cruel
situation
I
am
placed
.
 
<EOS>
Loving
Miss
Haredale
as
I
do
"
---
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
fellow
,
"
interrupted
his
father
with
a
compassionate
smile
,
"
you
do
nothing
of
the
kind
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
know
anything
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
no
such
thing
,
I
assure
you
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
do
take
my
word
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
good
sense
,
Ned
,
---
great
good
sense
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
you
should
be
guilty
of
such
amazing
absurdities
.
 
<EOS>
You
really
surprise
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
repeat
,
"
said
his
son
firmly
,
"
that
I
love
her
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
interposed
to
part
us
,
and
have
,
to
the
extent
I
have
just
now
told
you
of
,
succeeded
.
 
<EOS>
May
I
induce
you
,
sir
,
in
time
,
to
think
more
favourably
of
our
attachment
,
or
is
it
your
intention
and
your
fixed
design
to
hold
us
asunder
if
you
can
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Ned
,
"
returned
his
father
,
taking
a
pinch
of
snuff
and
pushing
his
box
towards
him
,
"
<EOS>
that
is
my
purpose
most
undoubtedly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
time
that
has
elapsed
,
"
rejoined
his
son
,
"
since
I
began
to
know
her
worth
,
has
flown
in
such
a
dream
that
until
now
I
have
hardly
once
paused
to
reflect
upon
my
true
position
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
it
?
<EOS>
From
my
childhood
I
have
been
accustomed
to
luxury
and
idleness
,
and
have
been
bred
as
though
my
fortune
were
large
,
and
my
expectations
almost
without
a
limit
.
 
<EOS>
The
idea
of
wealth
has
been
familiarised
to
me
from
my
cradle
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
taught
to
look
upon
those
means
,
by
which
men
raise
themselves
to
riches
and
distinction
,
as
being
beyond
my
heeding
,
and
beneath
my
care
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
,
as
the
phrase
is
,
liberally
educated
,
and
am
fit
for
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
myself
at
last
wholly
dependent
upon
you
,
with
no
resource
but
in
your
favour
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
momentous
question
of
my
life
we
do
not
,
and
it
would
seem
we
never
can
,
agree
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
shrunk
instinctively
alike
from
those
to
whom
you
have
urged
me
to
pay
court
,
and
from
the
motives
of
interest
and
gain
which
have
rendered
them
in
your
eyes
visible
objects
for
my
suit
.
 
<EOS>
If
there
never
has
been
thus
much
plain
-
speaking
between
us
before
,
sir
,
the
fault
has
not
been
mine
,
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
seem
to
speak
too
plainly
now
,
it
is
,
believe
me
father
,
in
the
hope
that
there
may
be
a
franker
spirit
,
a
worthier
reliance
,
and
a
kinder
confidence
between
us
in
time
to
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
good
fellow
,
"
said
his
smiling
father
,
"
you
quite
affect
me
.
<EOS>
Go
on
,
my
dear
Edward
,
I
beg
.
 
<EOS>
But
remember
your
promise
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
great
earnestness
,
vast
candour
,
a
manifest
sincerity
in
all
you
say
,
but
I
fear
I
observe
the
faintest
indications
of
a
tendency
to
prose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
sorry
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
sorry
,
too
,
Ned
,
but
you
know
that
I
can
not
fix
my
mind
for
any
long
period
upon
one
subject
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
'll
come
to
the
point
at
once
,
I
'll
imagine
all
that
ought
to
go
before
,
and
conclude
it
said
.
 
<EOS>
Oblige
me
with
the
milk
again
.
 
<EOS>
Listening
,
invariably
makes
me
feverish
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
I
would
say
then
,
tends
to
this
,
"
said
Edward
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
bear
this
absolute
dependence
,
sir
,
even
upon
you
.
 
<EOS>
Time
has
been
lost
and
opportunity
thrown
away
,
but
I
am
yet
a
young
man
,
and
may
retrieve
it
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
give
me
the
means
of
devoting
such
abilities
and
energies
as
I
possess
,
to
some
worthy
pursuit
?
 
<EOS>
Will
you
let
me
try
to
make
for
myself
an
honourable
path
in
life
?
 
<EOS>
For
any
term
you
please
to
name
---
say
for
five
years
if
you
will
---
I
will
pledge
myself
to
move
no
further
in
the
matter
of
our
difference
without
your
fall
concurrence
.
 
<EOS>
During
that
period
,
I
will
endeavour
earnestly
and
patiently
,
if
ever
man
did
,
to
open
some
prospect
for
myself
,
and
free
you
from
the
burden
you
fear
I
should
become
if
I
married
one
<EOS>
whose
worth
and
beauty
are
her
chief
endowments
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
do
this
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
At
the
expiration
of
the
term
we
agree
upon
,
let
us
discuss
this
subject
again
.
 
<EOS>
Till
then
,
unless
it
is
revived
by
you
,
let
it
never
be
renewed
between
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Ned
,
"
returned
his
father
,
laying
down
the
newspaper
at
which
he
had
been
glancing
carelessly
,
and
throwing
himself
back
in
the
window
-
seat
,
"
<EOS>
I
believe
you
know
how
very
much
I
dislike
what
are
called
family
affairs
,
which
are
only
fit
for
plebeian
Christmas
days
,
and
have
no
manner
of
business
with
people
of
our
condition
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
you
are
proceeding
upon
a
mistake
,
Ned
---
 
altogether
upon
a
mistake
---
I
will
conquer
my
repugnance
to
entering
on
such
matters
,
and
give
you
a
perfectly
plain
and
candid
answer
,
if
you
will
do
me
the
favour
to
shut
the
door
.

"
  
<EOS>
Edward
having
obeyed
him
,
he
took
an
elegant
little

from
his
pocket
,

paring
his
nails

continued
:
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
to
thank
me
,
Ned
,
for
being
of
good
family
;
for
your
mother
,
charming
person
as
she
was
,
and
almost
broken
-
hearted
,
and
so
forth
,
as
she
left
me
,
when
she
was
prematurely
compelled
to
become
immortal
---
had
nothing
to
boast
of
in
that
respect
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Her
father
was
at
least
an
eminent
lawyer
,
sir
,
"
said
Edward
.
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
right
,
Ned
;
perfectly
so
.
 
<EOS>
He
stood
high
at
the
bar
,
had
a
great
name
and
great
wealth
,
but
having
risen
from
nothing
<EOS>
---
I
have
always
closed
my
eyes
to
the
circumstance
and
steadily
resisted
its
contemplation
,
but
I
fear
his
father
dealt
in
pork
,
and
that
his
business
did
once
involve
cow
-
heel
and
sausages
---
he
wished
to
marry
his
daughter
into
a
good
family
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
his
heart
's
desire
,
Ned
.
<EOS>
I
was
a
younger
son
's
younger
son
,
and
I
married
her
.
 
<EOS>
We
each
had
our
object
,
and
gained
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
stepped
at
once
into
the
politest
and
best
circles
,
and
I
stepped
into
a
fortune
which
I
assure
you
was
very
necessary
to
my
comfort
---
quite
indispensable
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
my
good
fellow
,
that
fortune
is
among
the
things
that
have
been
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
gone
,
Ned
,
and
has
been
gone
<EOS>
---
how
old
are
you
?
 
<EOS>
I
always
forget
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Seven
-
and
-
twenty
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
indeed
?
"
cried
his
father
,
raising
his
eyelids
in
a
languishing
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
much
!
 
<EOS>
Then
I
should
say
,
Ned
,
that
as
nearly
as
I
remember
,
its
skirts
vanished
from
human
knowledge
,
about
eighteen
or
nineteen
years
ago
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
about
that
time
when
I
came
to
live
in
these
chambers
<EOS>
(
once
your
grandfather
's
,
and
bequeathed
by
that
extremely
respectable
person
to
me
)
,
and
commenced
to
live
upon
an
inconsiderable
annuity
and
my
past
reputation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
jesting
with
me
,
sir
,
"
said
Edward
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
in
the
slightest
degree
,
I
assure
you
,
"
returned
his
father
with
great
composure
.
 
<EOS>
"
These
family
topics
are
so
extremely
dry
,
that
I
am
sorry
to
say
they
do
n't
admit
of
any
such
relief
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
for
that
reason
,
and
because
they
have
an
appearance
of
business
,
that
I
dislike
them
so
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
You
know
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
A
son
,
Ned
,
unless
he
is
old
enough
to
be
a
companion
---
that
is
to
say
,
unless
he
is
some
two
or
three
and
twenty
---
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
to
have
about
one
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
restraint
upon
his
father
,
his
father
is
a
restraint
upon
him
,
and
they
make
each
other
mutually
uncomfortable
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
until
within
the
last
four
years
or
so
---
 
I
have
a
poor
memory
for
dates
,
and
if
I
mistake
,
you
will
correct
me
in
your
own
mind
---
you
pursued
your
studies
at
a
distance
,
and
picked
up
a
great
variety
of
accomplishments
.
 
<EOS>
Occasionally
we
passed
a
week
or
two
together
here
,
and
disconcerted
each
other
as
only
such
near
relations
can
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
you
came
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
candidly
tell
you
,
my
dear
boy
,
that
if
you
had
been
awkward
and
overgrown
,
I
should
have
exported
you
to
some
distant
part
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
with
all
my
soul
you
had
,
sir
,
"
said
Edward
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
you
do
n't
,
Ned
<EOS>
,
"
said
his
father
coolly
;
"
you
are
mistaken
,
I
assure
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
you
a
handsome
,
prepossessing
,
elegant
fellow
,
and
<EOS>
I
threw
you
into
the
society
I
can
still
command
.
<EOS>
Having
done
that
,
my
dear
fellow
,
I
consider
that
I
have
provided
for
you
in
life
,
and
rely
upon
your
doing
something
to
provide
for
me
in
return
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
understand
your
meaning
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
meaning
,
Ned
,
is
obvious
---
I
observe
another
fly
in
the
cream
-
jug
,
but
have
the
goodness
not
to
take
it
out
as
you
did
the
first
,
for
their
walk
when
their
legs
are
milky
,
is
extremely
ungraceful
and
disagreeable
---
my
meaning
is
,
that
you
must
do
as
I
did
;
that
you
must
marry
well
and
make
the
most
of
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
mere
fortune
-
hunter
!
"
cried
the
son
,
indignantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
in
the
devil
's
name
,
Ned
,
would
you
be
!
"
returned
the
father
.
<EOS>
"
All
men
are
fortune
-
hunters
,
are
they
not
?
 
<EOS>
The
law
,
the
church
,
the
court
,
the
camp
---
see
how
they
are
all
crowded
with
fortune
-
hunters
,
jostling
each
other
in
the
pursuit
.
 
<EOS>
The
stock
-
exchange
,
the
pulpit
,
the
counting
-
house
,
the
royal
drawing
-
room
,
the
senate
,
---
<EOS>
what
but
fortune
-
hunters
are
they
filled
with
?
 
<EOS>
A
fortune
-
hunter
!
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
You
ARE
one
;
and
you
would
be
nothing
else
,
my
dear
Ned
,
if
you
were
the
greatest
courtier
,
lawyer
,
legislator
,
prelate
,
or
merchant
,
in
existence
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
are
squeamish
and
moral
,
Ned
,
console
yourself
with
the
reflection
that
at
the
very
worst
your
fortune
-
hunting
can
make
but
one
person
miserable
or
unhappy
.
 
<EOS>
How
many
people
do
you
suppose
these
other
kinds
of
huntsmen
crush
in
following
their
sport
---
<EOS>
hundreds
at
a
step
?
 
<EOS>
Or
thousands
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
young
man
leant
his
head
upon
his
hand
,
and
made
no
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
charmed
,
"
said
the
father
rising
,
and
walking
slowly
to
and
fro
---
stopping
now
and
then
to
glance
at
himself
in
the
mirror
,
or
survey
a
picture
through
his
glass
,
with
the
air
of
a
connoisseur
,
"
that
we
have
had
this
conversation
,
Ned
,
unpromising
as
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
It
establishes
a
confidence
between
us
which
is
quite
delightful
,
and
was
certainly
necessary
,
though
how
you
can
ever
have
mistaken
our
positions
and
designs
<EOS>
,
I
confess
I
can
not
understand
.
 
<EOS>
I
conceived
,
until
I
found
your
fancy
for
this
girl
,
that
all
these
points
were
tacitly
agreed
upon
between
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
knew
you
were
embarrassed
,
sir
,
"
returned
the
son
,
raising
his
head
for
a
moment
,
and
then
falling
into
his
former
attitude
,
"
but
I
had
no
idea
we
were
the
beggared
<EOS>
wretches
you
describe
.
 
<EOS>
How
could
I
suppose
it
,
bred
as
I
have
been
;
witnessing
the
life
you
have
always
led
;
and
the
appearance
you
have
always
made
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
child
,
"
said
the
father
---
"
<EOS>
for
you
really
talk
so
like
a
child
that
I
must
call
you
one
<EOS>
---
you
were
bred
upon
a
careful
principle
;
the
very
manner
of
your
education
,
I
assure
you
,
maintained
my
credit
surprisingly
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
the
life
I
lead
,
I
must
lead
it
,
Ned
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
have
these
little
refinements
about
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
always
been
used
to
them
,
and
I
can
not
exist
without
them
.
<EOS>
They
must
surround
me
,
you
observe
,
and
therefore
they
are
here
.
<EOS>
With
regard
to
our
circumstances
,
Ned
,
you
may
set
your
mind
at
rest
upon
that
score
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
desperate
.
 
<EOS>
Your
own
appearance
is
by
no
means
despicable
,
and
our
joint
pocket
-
money
alone
devours
our
income
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
have
I
never
known
this
before
?
 
<EOS>
Why
have
you
encouraged
me
,
sir
,
to
an
expenditure
and
mode
of
life
to
which
we
have
no
right
or
title
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
good
fellow
,
"
returned
his
father
more
compassionately
than
ever
,
"
if
you
made
no
appearance
,
how
could
you
possibly
succeed
in
the
pursuit
for
which
I
destined
you
?
 
<EOS>
As
to
our
mode
of
life
,
every
man
has
a
right
to
live
in
the
best
way
he
can
;
and
to
make
himself
as
comfortable
as
he
can
,
or
he
is
an
unnatural
scoundrel
.
<EOS>
Our
debts
,
I
grant
,
are
very
great
,
and
therefore
it
the
more
behoves
you
,
as
a
young
man
of
principle
and
honour
,
to
pay
them
off
as
speedily
as
possible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
villain
's
part
,
"
muttered
Edward
,
"
that
I
have
unconsciously
played
!
 
<EOS>
I
to
win
the
heart
of
Emma
Haredale
!
 
<EOS>
I
would
,
for
her
sake
,
I
had
died
first
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
you
see
,
Ned
,
"
returned
his
father
,
"
<EOS>
how
perfectly
self
-
evident
it
is
,
that
nothing
can
be
done
in
that
quarter
.
 
<EOS>
But
apart
from
this
,
and
the
necessity
of
your
speedily
bestowing
yourself
on
another
(
as
you
know
you
could
to
-
morrow
,
if
you
chose
)
,
I
wish
you
'd
look
upon
it
pleasantly
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
religious
point
of
view
alone
,
how
could
you
ever
think
of
uniting
yourself
to
a
Catholic
,
unless
she
was
amazingly
rich
?
 
<EOS>
You
ought
to
be
so
very
Protestant
,
coming
of
such
a
Protestant
family
as
you
do
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
be
moral
,
Ned
,
or
we
are
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Even
if
one
could
set
that
objection
aside
,
which
is
impossible
,
we
come
to
another
which
is
quite
conclusive
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
idea
of
marrying
a
girl
whose
father
was
killed
,
like
meat
!
 
<EOS>
Good
God
,
Ned
,
how
disagreeable
!
 
<EOS>
Consider
the
impossibility
of
having
any
respect
for
your
father
-
in
-
law
under
such
unpleasant
circumstances
---
think
of
his
having
been
"
viewed
"
by
jurors
,
and
"
sat
upon
"
by
coroners
,
and
of
his
very
doubtful
position
in
the
family
ever
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
It
seems
to
me
such
an
indelicate
sort
of
thing
that
I
really
think
the
girl
ought
to
have
been
put
to
death
by
the
state
to
prevent
its
happening
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
tease
you
perhaps
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
rather
be
alone
?
 
<EOS>
My
dear
Ned
,
most
willingly
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
going
out
presently
,
but
we
shall
meet
to
-
night
,
or
if
not
to
-
night
,
certainly
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Take
care
of
yourself
in
the
mean
time
,
for
both
our
sakes
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
a
person
of
great
consequence
to
me
,
Ned
---
of
vast
consequence
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
the
father
,
who
had
been
arranging
his
cravat
in
the
glass
,
while
he
uttered
them
in
a
disconnected
careless
manner
,
withdrew
,
humming
a
tune
as
he
went
.
 
<EOS>
The
son
,
who
had
appeared
so
lost
in
thought
as
not
to
hear
or
understand
them
,
remained
quite
still
and
silent
.
 
<EOS>
After
the
lapse
of
half
an
hour
or
so
,
the
elder
Chester
,
gaily
dressed
,
went
out
.
 
<EOS>
The
younger
still
sat
with
his
head
resting
on
his
hands
,
in
what
appeared
to
be
a
kind
of
stupor

Chapter
16
    
A
series
of
pictures
representing
the
streets
of
London
in
the
night
,
even
at
the
comparatively
recent
date
of
this
tale
,
would
present
to
the
eye
something
so
very
different
in
character
from
the
reality
which
is
witnessed
in
these
times
,
that
it
would
be
difficult
for
the
beholder
to
recognise
his
most
familiar
walks
in
the
altered
aspect
of
little
more
than
half
a
century
ago
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
,
one
and
all
,
from
the
broadest
and
best
to
the
narrowest
and
least
frequented
,
very
dark
.
 
<EOS>
The
oil
and
cotton
lamps
,
though
regularly
trimmed
twice
or
thrice
in
the
long
winter
nights
,
burnt
feebly
at
the
best
;
and
at
a
late
hour
,
when
they
were
unassisted
by
the
lamps
and
candles
in
the
shops
,
cast
but
a
narrow
track
of
doubtful
light
upon
the
footway
,
leaving
the
projecting
doors
and
house
-
fronts
in
the
deepest
gloom
.
 
<EOS>
Many
of
the
courts
and
lanes
were
left
in
total
darkness
;
those
of
the
meaner
sort
,
where
one
glimmering
light
twinkled
for
a
score
of
houses
,
being
favoured
in
no
slight
degree
.
 
<EOS>
Even
in
these
places
,
the
inhabitants
had
often
good
reason
for
extinguishing
their
lamp
as
soon
as
it
was
lighted
;
and
the
watch
being
utterly
inefficient
and
powerless
to
prevent
them
,
they
did
so
at
their
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
in
the
lightest
thoroughfares
,
there
was
at
every
turn
some
obscure
and
dangerous
spot
whither
a
thief
might
fly
or
shelter
,
and
few
would
care
to
follow
;
and
the
city
being
belted
round
by
fields
,
green
lanes
,
waste
grounds
,
and
lonely
roads
,
dividing
it
at
that
time
from
the
suburbs
that
have
joined
it
since
,
escape
,
even
where
the
pursuit
was
hot
,
was
rendered
easy
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
no
wonder
that
with
these
favouring
circumstances
in
full
and
constant
operation
,
street
robberies
,
often
accompanied
by
cruel
wounds
,
and
not
unfrequently
by
loss
of
life
,
should
have
been
of
nightly
occurrence
in
the
very
heart
of
London
,
or
that
quiet
folks
should
have
had
great
dread
of
traversing
its
streets
after
the
shops
were
closed
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
unusual
for
those
who
wended
home
alone
at
midnight
,
to
keep
the
middle
of
the
road
,
the
better
to
guard
against
surprise
from
lurking
footpads
;
few
would
venture
to
repair
at
a
late
hour
to
Kentish
Town
or
Hampstead
,
or
even
to
Kensington
or
Chelsea
,
unarmed
and
unattended
;
while
he
who
had
been
loudest
and
most
valiant
at
the
supper
-
table
or
the
tavern
,
and
had
but
a
mile
or
so
to
go
,
was
glad
to
fee
a
link
-
boy
to
escort
him
home
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
many
other
characteristics
---
not
quite
so
disagreeable
---
 
about
the
thoroughfares
of
London
then
,
with
which
they
had
been
long
familiar
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
the
shops
,
especially
those
to
the
eastward
of
Temple
Bar
,
still
adhered
to
the
old
practice
of
hanging
out
a
sign
;
and
the
creaking
and
swinging
of
these
boards
in
their
iron
frames
on
windy
nights
,
formed
a
strange
and
mournfal
concert
for
the
ears
of
those
who
lay
awake
in
bed
or
hurried
through
the
streets
.
 
<EOS>
Long
stands
of
hackney
-
chairs
and
groups
of
chairmen
,
compared
with
whom
the
coachmen
of
our
day
are
gentle
and
polite
,
obstructed
the
way
and
filled
the
air
with
clamour
;
night
-
cellars
,
indicated
by
a
little
stream
of
light
crossing
the
pavement
,
and
stretching
out
half
-
way
into
the
road
,
and
by
the
stifled
roar
of
voices
from
below
,
yawned
for
the
reception
and
entertainment
of
the
most
abandoned
of
both
sexes
;
under
every
shed
and
bulk
small
groups
of
link
-
boys
gamed
away
the
earnings
of
the
day
;
or
one
more
weary
than
the
rest
,
gave
way
to
sleep
,
and
let
the
fragment
of
his
torch
fall
hissing
on
the
puddled
ground
.
  
<EOS>
Then
there
was
the
watch
with
staff
and
lantern
crying
the
hour
,
and
the
kind
of
weather
;
and
those
who
woke
up
at
his
voice
and
turned
them
round
in
bed
,
were
glad
to
hear
it
rained
,
or
snowed
,
or
blew
,
or
froze
,
for
very
comfort
's
sake
.
 
<EOS>
The
solitary
passenger
was
startled
by
the
chairmen
's
cry
of
"
By
your
leave
there
!
"
<EOS>
as
two
came
trotting
past
him
with
their
empty
vehicle
---
carried
backwards
to
show
its
being
disengaged
---
and
hurried
to
the
nearest
stand
.
<EOS>
Many
a
private
chair
,
too
,
inclosing
some
fine
lady
,
monstrously
hooped
and
furbelowed
,
and
preceded
by
running
-
footmen
bearing
flambeaux
---
for
which
extinguishers
are
yet
suspended
before
the
doors
of
a
few
houses
of
the
better
sort
---
made
the
way
gay
and
light
as
it
danced
along
,
and
darker
and
more
dismal
when
it
had
passed
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
unusual
for
these
running
gentry
,
who
carried
it
with
a
very
high
hand
,
to
quarrel
in
the
servants
'
hall
while
waiting
for
their
masters
and
mistresses
;
and
,
falling
to
blows
either
there
or
in
the
street
without
,
to
strew
the
place
of
skirmish
with
hair
-
powder
,
fragments
of
bag
-
wigs
,
and
scattered
nosegays
.
 
<EOS>
Gaming
,
the
vice
which
ran
so
high
among
all
classes
(
the
fashion
being
of
course
set
by
the
upper
)
,
was
generally
the
cause
of
these
disputes
;
for
cards
and
dice
were
as
openly
used
,
and
worked
as
much
mischief
,
and
yielded
as
much
excitement
below
stairs
,
as
above
.
 
<EOS>
While
incidents
like
these
,
arising
out
of
drums
and
masquerades
and
parties
at
quadrille
,
were
passing
at
the
west
end
of
the
town
,
heavy
stagecoaches
and
scarce
heavier
waggons
were
lumbering
slowly
towards
the
city
,
the
coachmen
,
guard
,
and
passengers
,
armed
to
the
teeth
,
and
the
coach
---
a
day
or
so
perhaps
behind
its
time
,
but
that
was
nothing
---
despoiled
by
highwaymen
;
who
made
no
scruple
to
attack
,
alone
and
single
-
handed
,
a
whole
caravan
of
goods
and
men
,
and
sometimes
shot
a
passenger
or
two
,
and
were
sometimes
shot
themselves
,
as
the
case
might
be
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
morrow
,
rumours
of
this
new
act
of
daring
on
the
road
yielded
matter
for
a
few
hours
'
conversation
through
the
town
,
and
a
Public
Progress
of
some
fine
gentleman
(
half
-
drunk
)
to
Tyburn
,
dressed
in
the
newest
fashion
,
and
damning
the
ordinary
with
unspeakable
gallantry
and
grace
,
furnished
to
the
populace
,
at
once
a
pleasant
excitement
and
a
wholesome
and
profound
example
.
  
<EOS>
Among
all
the
dangerous
characters
who
,
in
such
a
state
of
society
,
prowled
and
skulked
in
the
metropolis
at
night
,
there
was
one
man
from
whom
many
as
uncouth
and
fierce
as
he
,
shrunk
with
an
involuntary
dread
.
 
<EOS>
Who
he
was
,
or
<EOS>
whence
he
came
,
was
a
question
often
asked
,
but
which
none
could
answer
.
 
<EOS>
His
name
was
unknown
,
he
had
never
been
seen
until
within
about
eight
days
or
thereabouts
,
and
was
equally
a
stranger
to
the
old
ruffians
,
upon
whose
haunts
he
ventured
fearlessly
,
as
to
the
young
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
be
no
spy
,
for
he
never
removed
his
slouched
hat
to
look
about
him
,
entered
into
conversation
with
no
man
,
heeded
nothing
that
passed
,
listened
to
no
discourse
,
regarded
nobody
that
came
or
went
.
 
<EOS>
But
so
surely
as
the
dead
of
night
set
in
,
so
surely
this
man
was
in
the
midst
of
the
loose
concourse
in
the
night
-
cellar
where
outcasts
of
every
grade
resorted
;
and
there
he
sat
till
morning
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
not
only
a
spectre
at
their
licentious
feasts
;
a
something
in
the
midst
of
their
revelry
and
riot
that
chilled
and
haunted
them
;
but
out
of
doors
he
was
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
Directly
it
was
dark
,
he
was
abroad
---
never
in
company
with
any
one
,
but
always
alone
;
never
lingering
or
loitering
,
but
always
walking
swiftly
;
and
looking
(
so
they
said
who
had
seen
him
)
over
his
shoulder
from
time
to
time
,
and
as
he
did
so
quickening
his
pace
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
fields
,
the
lanes
,
the
roads
,
in
all
quarters
of
the
town
---
east
,
west
,
north
,
and
south
---
that
man
was
seen
gliding
on
like
a
shadow
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
always
hurrying
away
.
 
<EOS>
Those
who
encountered
him
,
saw
him
steal
past
,
caught
sight
of
the
backward
glance
,
and
so
lost
him
in
the
darkness
.
  
<EOS>
This
constant
restlessness
,
and
flitting
to
and
fro
,
gave
rise
to
strange
stories
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
seen
in
such
distant
and
remote
places
,
at
times
so
nearly
tallying
with
each
other
,
that
some
doubted
whether
there
were
not
two
of
them
,
or
more
---
some
,
whether
he
had
not
unearthly
means
of
travelling
from
spot
to
spot
.
 
<EOS>
The
footpad
hiding
in
a
ditch
had
marked
him
passing
like
a
ghost
along
its
brink
;
the
vagrant
had
met
him
on
the
dark
high
-
road
;
the
beggar
had
seen
him
pause
upon
the
bridge
to
look
down
at
the
water
,
and
then
sweep
on
again
;
they
who
dealt
in
bodies
with
the
surgeons
could
swear
he
slept
in
churchyards
,
and
that
they
had
beheld
him
glide
away
among
the
tombs
on
their
approach
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
they
told
these
stories
to
each
other
,
one
who
had
looked
about
him
would
pull
his
neighbour
by
the
sleeve
,
and
there
he
would
be
among
them
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
,
one
man
---
he
was
one
of
those
whose
commerce
lay
among
the
graves
---
resolved
to
question
this
strange
companion
.
 
<EOS>
Next
night
,
when
he
had
eat
his
poor
meal
voraciously
(
he
was
accustomed
to
do
that
,
they
had
observed
,
as
though
he
had
no
other
in
the
day
)
,
this
fellow
sat
down
at
his
elbow
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
black
night
,
master
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
black
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Blacker
than
last
,
though
that
was
pitchy
too
.
 
<EOS>
Did
n't
I
pass
you
near
the
turnpike
in
the
Oxford
Road
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
like
you
may
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Come
,
come
,
master
,
"
cried
the
fellow
,
urged
on
by
the
looks
of
his
comrades
,
and
slapping
him
on
the
shoulder
;
"
be
more
companionable
and
communicative
.
 
<EOS>
Be
more
the
gentleman
in
this
good
company
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
tales
among
us
that
you
have
sold
yourself
to
the
devil
,
and
I
know
not
what
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
all
have
,
have
we
not
?
"
returned
the
stranger
,
looking
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
we
were
fewer
in
number
,
perhaps
he
would
give
better
wages
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
goes
rather
hard
with
you
,
indeed
,
"
said
the
fellow
,
as
the
stranger
disclosed
his
haggard
unwashed
face
,
and
torn
clothes
.
<EOS>
"
What
of
that
?
 
<EOS>
Be
merry
,
master
.
 
<EOS>
A
stave
of
a
roaring
song
now
"
---
   
<EOS>
"
Sing
you
,
if
you
desire
to
hear
one
,
"
replied
the
other
,
shaking
him
roughly
off
;
"
and
do
n't
touch
me
if
you
're
a
prudent
man
;
I
carry
arms
which
go
off
easily
---
they
have
done
so
,
before
now
---
and
make
it
dangerous
for
strangers
who
do
n't
know
the
trick
of
them
,
to
lay
hands
upon
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
threaten
?
"
said
the
fellow
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
returned
the
other
,
rising
and
turning
upon
him
,
and
looking
fiercely
round
as
if
in
apprehension
of
a
general
attack
.
  
<EOS>
His
voice
,
and
look
,
and
bearing
---
all
expressive
of
the
wildest
recklessness
and
desperation
---
daunted
while
they
repelled
the
bystanders
.
 
<EOS>
Although
in
a
very
different
sphere
of
action
now
,
they
were
not
without
much
of
the
effect
they
had
wrought
at
the
Maypole
Inn
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
what
you
all
are
,
and
live
as
you
all
do
,
"
said
the
man
sternly
,
after
a
short
silence
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
in
hiding
here
like
the
rest
,
and
if
we
were
surprised
<EOS>
would
perhaps
do
my
part
with
the
best
of
ye
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
's
my
humour
to
be
left
to
myself
,
let
me
have
it
.
 
<EOS>
Otherwise
,
"
---
and
here
he
swore
a
tremendous
oath
---
"
there
'll
be
mischief
done
in
this
place
,
though
there
ARE
odds
of
a
score
against
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
low
murmur
,
having
its
origin
perhaps
in
a
dread
of
the
man
and
the
mystery
that
surrounded
him
,
or
perhaps
in
a
sincere
opinion
on
the
part
of
some
of
those
present
,
that
it
would
be
an
inconvenient
precedent
to
meddle
too
curiously
with
a
gentleman
's
private
affairs
if
he
saw
reason
to
conceal
them
,
warned
the
fellow
who
had
occasioned
this
discussion
that
he
had
best
pursue
it
no
further
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
short
time
the
strange
man
lay
down
upon
a
bench
to
sleep
,
and
when
they
thought
of
him
again
,
they
found
he
was
gone
.
  
<EOS>
Next
night
,
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
,
he
was
abroad
again
and
traversing
the
streets
;
he
was
before
the
locksmith
's
house
more
than
once
,
but
the
family
were
out
,
and
it
was
close
shut
.
 
<EOS>
This
night
he
crossed
London
Bridge
and
passed
into
Southwark
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
glided
down
a
bye
street
,
a
woman
with
a
little
basket
on
her
arm
,
turned
into
it
at
the
other
end
.
 
<EOS>
Directly
he
observed
her
,
he
sought
the
shelter
of
an
archway
,
and
stood
aside
until
she
had
passed
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
emerged
cautiously
from
his
hiding
-
place
,
and
followed
.
  
<EOS>
She
went
into
several
shops
to
purchase
various
kinds
of
household
necessaries
,
and
round
every
place
at
which
she
stopped
he
hovered
like
her
evil
spirit
;
following
her
when
she
reappeared
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
nigh
eleven
o'clock
,
and
the
passengers
in
the
streets
were
thinning
fast
,
when
she
turned
,
doubtless
to
go
home
.
 
<EOS>
The
phantom
still
followed
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
turned
into
the
same
bye
street
in
which
he
had
seen
her
first
,
which
,
being
free
from
shops
,
and
narrow
,
was
extremely
dark
.
 
<EOS>
She
quickened
her
pace
here
,
as
though
distrustful
of
being
stopped
,
and
robbed
of
such
trifling
property
as
she
carried
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
crept
along
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
Had
she
been
gifted
with
the
speed
of
wind
<EOS>
,
it
seemed
as
if
his
terrible
shadow
would
have
tracked
her
down
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
the
widow
---
for
she
it
was
---
reached
her
own
door
,
and
,
panting
for
breath
,
paused
to
take
the
key
from
her
basket
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
flush
and
glow
,
with
the
haste
she
had
made
,
and
the
pleasure
of
being
safe
at
home
,
she
stooped
to
draw
it
out
,
when
,
raising
her
head
,
she
saw
him
standing
silently
beside
her
:
<EOS>
the
apparition
of
a
dream
.
  
<EOS>
His
hand
was
on
her
mouth
,
but
that
was
needless
,
for
her
tongue
clove
to
its
roof
,
and
her
power
of
utterance
was
gone
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
looking
for
you
many
nights
.
 
<EOS>
Is
the
house
empty
?
 
<EOS>
Answer
me
.
<EOS>
Is
any
one
inside
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
could
only
answer
by
a
rattle
in
her
throat
.
  
<EOS>
"
Make
me
a
sign
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
indicate
that
there
was
no
one
there
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
the
key
,
unlocked
the
door
,
carried
her
in
,
and
secured
it
carefully
behind
them
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
17
    
<EOS>
It
was
a
chilly
night
,
and
the
fire
in
the
widow
's
parlour
had
burnt
low
.
 
<EOS>
Her
strange
companion
placed
her
in
a
chair
,
and
stooping
down
before
the
half
-
extinguished
ashes
,
raked
them
together
and
fanned
them
with
his
hat
.
 
<EOS>
From
time
to
time
he
glanced
at
her
over
his
shoulder
,
as
though
to
assure
himself
of
her
remaining
quiet
and
making
no
effort
to
depart
;
and
that
done
,
busied
himself
about
the
fire
again
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
without
reason
that
he
took
these
pains
,
for
his
dress
was
dank
and
drenched
with
wet
,
his
jaws
rattled
with
cold
,
and
he
shivered
from
head
to
foot
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
rained
hard
during
the
previous
night
and
for
some
hours
in
the
morning
,
but
since
noon
it
had
been
fine
.
 
<EOS>
Wheresoever
he
had
passed
the
hours
of
darkness
,
his
condition
sufficiently
betokened
that
many
of
them
had
been
spent
beneath
the
open
sky
.
 
<EOS>
Besmeared
with
mire
;
his
saturated
clothes
clinging
with
a
damp
embrace
about
his
limbs
;
his
beard
unshaven
,
his
face
unwashed
,
his
meagre
cheeks
worn
into
deep
hollows
,
---
a
more
miserable
wretch
could
hardly
be
,
than
this
man
who
now
cowered
down
upon
the
widow
's
hearth
,
and
watched
the
struggling
flame
with
bloodshot
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
,
fearing
,
as
it
seemed
,
to
look
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
So
they
remained
for
some
short
time
in
silence
.
<EOS>
Glancing
round
again
,
he
asked
at
length
:
  
"
Is
this
your
house
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
in
the
name
of
Heaven
,
do
you
darken
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Give
me
meat
and
drink
,
"
he
answered
sullenly
,
"
or
I
dare
do
more
than
that
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
marrow
in
my
bones
is
cold
,
with
wet
and
hunger
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
have
warmth
and
food
,
and
I
will
have
them
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
were
the
robber
on
the
Chigwell
road
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
nearly
a
murderer
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
will
was
not
wanting
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
one
came
upon
me
and
raised
the
hue
-
and
-
cry
'
,
that
it
would
have
gone
hard
with
,
but
for
his
nimbleness
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
a
thrust
at
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
thrust
your
sword
at
HIM
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
widow
,
looking
upwards
.
<EOS>
"
You
hear
this
man
!
<EOS>
you
hear
and
saw
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
at
her
,
as
,
with
her
head
thrown
back
,
and
her
hands
tight
clenched
together
,
she
uttered
these
words
in
an
agony
of
appeal
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
starting
to
his
feet
as
she
had
done
,
he
advanced
towards
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Beware
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
in
a
suppressed
voice
,
whose
firmness
stopped
him
midway
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
so
much
as
touch
me
with
a
finger
,
or
you
are
lost
;
body
and
soul
,
you
are
lost
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hear
me
,
"
he
replied
,
menacing
her
with
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
,
that
in
the
form
of
a
man
live
the
life
of
a
hunted
beast
<EOS>
;
that
in
the
body
am
a
spirit
,
a
ghost
upon
the
earth
,
a
thing
from
which
all
creatures
shrink
,
save
those
curst
beings
of
another
world
,
who
will
not
leave
me
;
---
I
am
,
in
my
desperation
of
this
night
,
past
all
fear
but
that
of
the
hell
in
which
I
exist
from
day
to
day
.
 
<EOS>
Give
the
alarm
,
cry
out
,
refuse
to
shelter
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
hurt
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
will
not
be
taken
alive
;
and
so
surely
as
you
threaten
me
above
your
breath
,
I
fall
a
dead
man
on
this
floor
.
 
<EOS>
The
blood
with
which
I
sprinkle
it
,
be
on
you
and
yours
,
in
the
name
of
the
Evil
Spirit
that
tempts
men
to
their
ruin
!
"
  
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
he
took
a
pistol
from
his
breast
,
and
firmly
clutched
it
in
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Remove
this
man
from
me
,
good
Heaven
!
"
cried
the
widow
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
thy
grace
and
mercy
,
give
him
one
minute
's
penitence
,
and
strike
him
dead
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
has
no
such
purpose
,
"
he
said
,
confronting
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
deaf
.
<EOS>
Give
me
to
eat
and
drink
,
lest
I
do
that
it
can
not
help
my
doing
,
and
will
not
do
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
leave
me
,
if
I
do
thus
much
?
 
<EOS>
Will
you
leave
me
and
return
no
more
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
promise
nothing
,
"
he
rejoined
,
seating
himself
at
the
table
,
"
nothing
but
this
<EOS>
---
I
will
execute
my
threat
if
you
betray
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
rose
at
length
,
and
going
to
a
closet
or
pantry
in
the
room
,
brought
out
some
fragments
of
cold
meat
and
bread
and
put
them
on
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
He
asked
for
brandy
,
and
for
water
.
 
<EOS>
These
she
produced
likewise
;
and
he
ate
and
drank
with
the
voracity
of
a
famished
hound
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
time
he
was
so
engaged
she
kept
at
the
uttermost
distance
of
the
chamber
,
and
sat
there
shuddering
,
<EOS>
but
with
her
face
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
never
turned
her
back
upon
him
once
;
and
although
when
she
passed
him
(
as
she
was
obliged
to
do
in
going
to
and
from
the
cupboard
)
<EOS>
she
gathered
the
skirts
of
her
garment
about
her
,
as
if
even
its
touching
his
by
chance
were
horrible
to
think
of
,
still
,
in
the
midst
of
all
this
dread
and
terror
,
she
kept
her
face
towards
his
own
,
and
watched
his
every
movement
.
  
<EOS>
His
repast
ended
---
if
that
can
be
called
one
,
which
was
a
mere
ravenous
satisfying
of
the
calls
of
hunger
---
he
moved
his
chair
towards
the
fire
again
,
and
warming
himself
before
the
blaze
which
had
now
sprung
brightly
up
,
accosted
her
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
an
outcast
,
to
whom
a
roof
above
his
head
is
often
an
uncommon
luxury
,
and
the
food
a
beggar
would
reject
is
delicate
fare
.
 
<EOS>
You
live
here
at
your
ease
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
live
alone
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
,
"
she
made
answer
with
an
effort
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
dwells
here
besides
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
One
---
it
is
no
matter
who
.
 
<EOS>
You
had
best
begone
,
or
he
may
find
you
here
.
 
<EOS>
Why
do
you
linger
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
warmth
,
"
he
replied
,
spreading
out
his
hands
before
the
fire
.
"
<EOS>
For
warmth
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
rich
,
perhaps
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
,
"
she
said
faintly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
rich
.
 
<EOS>
No
doubt
I
am
very
rich
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
least
you
are
not
penniless
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
some
money
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
making
purchases
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
little
left
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
but
a
few
shillings
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Give
me
your
purse
.
 
<EOS>
You
had
it
in
your
hand
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Give
it
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
stepped
to
the
table
and
laid
it
down
.
 
<EOS>
He
reached
across
,
took
it
up
,
and
told
the
contents
into
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
was
counting
them
,
she
listened
for
a
moment
,
and
sprung
towards
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Take
what
there
is
,
take
all
,
take
more
if
more
were
there
,
but
go
before
it
is
too
late
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
heard
a
wayward
step
without
,
I
know
full
well
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
return
directly
.
 
<EOS>
Begone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
not
stop
to
ask
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
answer
.
 
<EOS>
Much
as
I
dread
to
touch
you
,
I
would
drag
you
to
the
door
if
I
possessed
the
strength
,
rather
than
you
should
lose
an
instant
.
 
<EOS>
Miserable
wretch
!
<EOS>
fly
from
this
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
there
are
spies
without
,
I
am
safer
here
,
"
replied
the
man
,
standing
aghast
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
remain
here
,
and
will
not
fly
till
the
danger
is
past
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
too
late
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
widow
,
who
had
listened
for
the
step
,
and
not
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hark
to
that
foot
upon
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
tremble
to
hear
it
!
 
<EOS>
It
is
my
son
,
my
idiot
son
!
"
  
<EOS>
As
she
said
this
wildly
,
there
came
a
heavy
knocking
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
He
looked
at
her
,
and
she
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
him
come
in
,
"
said
the
man
,
hoarsely
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
fear
him
less
than
the
dark
,
houseless
night
.
 
<EOS>
He
knocks
again
.
 
<EOS>
Let
him
come
in
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
dread
of
this
hour
,
"
returned
the
widow
,
"
has
been
upon
me
all
my
life
,
and
I
will
not
.
 
<EOS>
Evil
will
fall
upon
him
,
if
you
stand
eye
to
eye
.
 
<EOS>
My
blighted
boy
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
all
good
angels
who
know
the
truth
---
 
hear
a
poor
mother
's
prayer
,
and
spare
my
boy
from
knowledge
of
this
man
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
rattles
at
the
shutters
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
calls
you
.
 
<EOS>
That
voice
and
cry
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
he
who
grappled
with
me
in
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
Was
it
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
had
sunk
upon
her
knees
,
and
so
knelt
down
,
moving
her
lips
,
but
uttering
no
sound
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
gazed
upon
her
,
uncertain
what
to
do
or
where
to
turn
,
the
shutters
flew
open
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
barely
time
to
catch
a
knife
from
the
table
,
sheathe
it
in
the
loose
sleeve
of
his
coat
,
hide
in
the
closet
,
and
do
all
with
the
lightning
's
speed
,
when
Barnaby
tapped
at
the
bare
glass
,
and
raised
the
sash
exultingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
who
can
keep
out
Grip
and
me
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
thrusting
in
his
head
,
and
staring
round
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
there
,
mother
?
 
<EOS>
How
long
you
keep
us
from
the
fire
and
light
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
stammered
some
excuse
and
tendered
him
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
But
Barnaby
sprung
lightly
in
without
assistance
,
and
putting
his
arms
about
her
neck
,
kissed
her
a
hundred
times
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
been
afield
,
mother
---
leaping
ditches
,
scrambling
through
hedges
,
running
down
steep
banks
,
up
and
away
,
and
hurrying
on
.
<EOS>
The
wind
has
been
blowing
,
and
the
rushes
and
young
plants
bowing
and
bending
to
it
,
lest
it
should
do
them
harm
,
the
cowards
---
and
Grip
---
ha
ha
ha
!
---
<EOS>
brave
Grip
,
who
cares
for
nothing
,
and
when
the
wind
rolls
him
over
in
the
dust
,
turns
manfully
to
bite
it
---
Grip
,
bold
Grip
,
has
quarrelled
with
every
little
bowing
twig
---
thinking
,
he
told
me
,
that
it
mocked
him
---
and
has
worried
it
like
a
bulldog
.
<EOS>
Ha
ha
ha
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
raven
,
in
his
little
basket
at
his
master
's
back
,
hearing
this
frequent
mention
of
his
name
in
a
tone
of
exultation
,
expressed
his
sympathy
by
crowing
like
a
cock
,
and
afterwards
running
over
his
various
phrases
of
speech
with
such
rapidity
,
and
in
so
many
varieties
of
hoarseness
,
that
they
sounded
like
the
murmurs
of
a
crowd
of
people
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
takes
such
care
of
me
besides
!
"
said
Barnaby
.
 
<EOS>
"
Such
care
,
mother
!
 
<EOS>
He
watches
all
the
time
I
sleep
,
and
when
I
shut
my
eyes
and
make
-
believe
to
slumber
,
he
practises
new
learning
softly
;
but
he
keeps
his
eye
on
me
the
while
,
and
if
he
sees
me
laugh
,
though
never
so
little
,
stops
directly
.
 
<EOS>
He
wo
n't
surprise
me
till
he
's
perfect
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
raven
crowed
again
in
a
rapturous
manner
which
plainly
said
,
"
Those
are
certainly
some
of
my
characteristics
,
and
I
glory
in
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
Barnaby
closed
the
window
and
secured
it
,
and
coming
to
the
fireplace
,
prepared
to
sit
down
with
his
face
to
the
closet
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
mother
prevented
this
,
by
hastily
taking
that
side
herself
,
and
motioning
him
towards
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
pale
you
are
to
-
night
!
"
said
Barnaby
,
leaning
on
his
stick
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
been
cruel
,
Grip
,
and
made
her
anxious
!
"
  
<EOS>
Anxious
in
good
truth
,
and
sick
at
heart
!
 
<EOS>
The
listener
held
the
door
of
his
hiding
-
place
open
with
his
hand
,
and
closely
watched
her
son
.
 
<EOS>
Grip
---
alive
to
everything
his
master
was
unconscious
of
---
 
had
his
head
out
of
the
basket
,
and
in
return
was
watching
him
intently
with
his
glistening
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
flaps
his
wings
,
"
said
Barnaby
,
turning
almost
quickly
enough
to
catch
the
retreating
form
and
closing
door
,
"
as
if
there
were
strangers
here
,
but
Grip
is
wiser
than
to
fancy
that
.
 
<EOS>
Jump
then
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Accepting
this
invitation
with
a
dignity
peculiar
to
himself
,
the
bird
hopped
up
on
his
master
's
shoulder
,
from
that
to
his
extended
hand
,
and
so
to
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
Barnaby
unstrapping
the
basket
and
putting
it
down
in
a
corner
with
the
lid
open
,
Grip
's
first
care
was
to
shut
it
down
with
all
possible
despatch
,
and
then
to
stand
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
Believing
,
no
doubt
,
that
he
had
now
rendered
it
utterly
impossible
,
and
beyond
the
power
of
mortal
man
,
to
shut
him
up
in
it
any
more
,
he
drew
a
great
many
corks
in
triumph
,
and
uttered
a
corresponding
number
of
hurrahs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
!
"
said
Barnaby
,
laying
aside
his
hat
and
stick
,
and
returning
to
the
chair
from
which
he
had
risen
,
"
I
'll
tell
you
where
we
have
been
to
-
day
,
and
what
we
have
been
doing
,
---
shall
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
took
his
hand
in
hers
,
and
holding
it
,
nodded
the
word
she
could
not
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
n't
tell
,
"
said
Barnaby
,
holding
up
his
finger
,
"
for
it
's
a
secret
,
mind
,
and
only
known
to
me
,
and
Grip
,
and
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
the
dog
with
us
,
but
he
's
not
like
Grip
,
clever
as
he
is
,
and
does
n't
guess
it
yet
,
I
'll
wager
.
<EOS>
---
Why
do
you
look
behind
me
so
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
I
?
"
she
answered
faintly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
know
I
did
.
 
<EOS>
Come
nearer
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
frightened
!
"
said
Barnaby
,
changing
colour
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mother
---
you
do
n't
see
"
---
   
<EOS>
"
See
what
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
---
there
's
none
of
this
about
,
is
there
?
"
<EOS>
he
answered
in
a
whisper
,
drawing
closer
to
her
and
clasping
the
mark
upon
his
wrist
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
there
is
,
somewhere
.
 
<EOS>
You
make
my
hair
stand
on
end
,
and
my
flesh
creep
.
 
<EOS>
Why
do
you
look
like
that
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
in
the
room
as
I
have
seen
it
in
my
dreams
,
dashing
the
ceiling
and
the
walls
with
red
?
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
fell
into
a
shivering
fit
as
he
put
the
question
,
and
shutting
out
the
light
with
his
hands
,
sat
shaking
in
every
limb
until
it
had
passed
away
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
time
,
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
about
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
gone
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
has
been
nothing
here
,
"
rejoined
his
mother
,
soothing
him
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
indeed
,
dear
Barnaby
.
 
<EOS>
Look
!
 
<EOS>
You
see
there
are
<EOS>
but
you
and
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
gazed
at
her
vacantly
,
and
,
becoming
reassured
by
degrees
,
burst
into
a
wild
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
let
us
see
,
"
he
said
,
thoughtfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
Were
we
talking
?
 
<EOS>
Was
it
you
and
me
?
 
<EOS>
Where
have
we
been
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Nowhere
but
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
but
Hugh
,
and
I
,
"
said
Barnaby
,
---
"
that
's
it
.
 
<EOS>
Maypole
Hugh
,
and
I
,
you
know
,
and
Grip
---
we
have
been
lying
in
the
forest
,
and
among
the
trees
by
the
road
side
,
with
a
dark
lantern
after
night
came
on
,
and
the
dog
in
a
noose
ready
to
slip
him
when
the
man
came
by
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
man
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
robber
;
him
that
the
stars
winked
at
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
waited
for
him
after
dark
these
many
nights
,
and
we
shall
have
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
know
him
in
a
thousand
.
 
<EOS>
Mother
,
see
here
!
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
Look
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
twisted
his
handkerchief
round
his
head
,
pulled
his
hat
upon
his
brow
,
wrapped
his
coat
about
him
,
and
stood
up
before
her
:
<EOS>
so
like
the
original
he
counterfeited
,
that
the
dark
figure
peering
out
behind
him
might
have
passed
for
his
own
shadow
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
ha
ha
!
 
<EOS>
We
shall
have
him
,
"
he
cried
,
ridding
himself
of
the
semblance
as
hastily
as
he
had
assumed
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
see
him
,
mother
,
bound
hand
and
foot
,
and
brought
to
London
at
a
saddle
-
girth
;
and
you
shall
hear
of
him
at
Tyburn
Tree
if
we
have
luck
.
<EOS>
So
Hugh
says
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
pale
again
,
and
trembling
.
 
<EOS>
And
why
DO
you
look
behind
me
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
nothing
,
"
she
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
quite
well
.
 
<EOS>
Go
you
to
bed
,
dear
,
and
leave
me
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
bed
!
"
<EOS>
he
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
like
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I
like
to
lie
before
the
fire
,
watching
the
prospects
in
the
burning
coals
---
the
rivers
,
hills
,
and
dells
,
in
the
deep
,
red
sunset
,
and
the
wild
faces
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
hungry
too
,
and
Grip
has
eaten
nothing
since
broad
noon
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
to
supper
.
 
<EOS>
Grip
!
 
<EOS>
To
supper
,
lad
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
raven
flapped
his
wings
,
and
,
croaking
his
satisfaction
,
hopped
to
the
feet
of
his
master
,
and
there
held
his
bill
open
,
ready
for
snapping
up
such
lumps
of
meat
as
he
should
throw
him
.
 
<EOS>
Of
these
he
received
about
a
score
in
rapid
succession
,
without
the
smallest
discomposure
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
,
"
said
Barnaby
.
  
<EOS>
"
More
!
"
cried
Grip
.
 
<EOS>
"
More
!
"
  
<EOS>
But
it
appearing
for
a
certainty
that
no
more
was
to
be
had
,
he
retreated
with
his
store
;
and
disgorging
the
morsels
one
by
one
from
his
pouch
,
hid
them
in
various
corners
---
taking
particular
care
,
however
,
to
avoid
the
closet
,
as
being
doubtful
of
the
hidden
man
's
propensities
and
power
of
resisting
temptation
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
concluded
these
arrangements
,
he
took
a
turn
or
two
across
the
room
with
an
elaborate
assumption
of
having
nothing
on
his
mind
(
<EOS>
but
with
one
eye
hard
upon
his
treasure
all
the
time
)
,
and
then
,
and
not
till
then
,
began
to
drag
it
out
,
piece
by
piece
,
and
eat
it
with
the
utmost
relish
.
  
<EOS>
Barnaby
,
for
his
part
,
having
pressed
his
mother
to
eat
in
vain
,
made
a
hearty
supper
too
.
 
<EOS>
Once
during
the
progress
of
his
meal
,
he
wanted
more
bread
from
the
closet
and
rose
to
get
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
hurriedly
interposed
to
prevent
him
,
and
summoning
her
utmost
fortitude
,
passed
into
the
recess
,
and
brought
it
out
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
"
said
Barnaby
,
looking
at
her
steadfastly
as
she
sat
down
beside
him
after
doing
so
;
"
is
to
-
day
my
birthday
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
-
day
!
"
<EOS>
she
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
recollect
it
was
<EOS>
but
a
week
or
so
ago
,
and
that
summer
,
autumn
,
and
winter
have
to
pass
before
it
comes
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
that
it
has
been
so
till
now
,
"
said
Barnaby
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
think
to
-
day
must
be
my
birthday
too
,
for
all
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
asked
him
why
?
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
why
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
always
seen
you
---
<EOS>
I
did
n't
let
you
know
it
,
but
I
have
---
on
the
evening
of
that
day
grow
very
sad
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
seen
you
cry
when
Grip
and
I
were
most
glad
;
and
look
frightened
with
no
reason
;
and
I
have
touched
your
hand
,
and
felt
that
it
was
cold
---
as
it
is
now
.
 
<EOS>
Once
,
mother
(
on
a
birthday
that
was
,
also
)
,
Grip
and
I
thought
of
this
after
we
went
upstairs
to
bed
,
and
when
it
was
midnight
,
striking
one
o'clock
,
we
came
down
to
your
door
to
see
if
you
were
well
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
on
your
knees
.
 
<EOS>
I
forget
what
it
was
you
said
.
 
<EOS>
Grip
,
what
was
it
<EOS>
we
heard
her
say
that
night
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
devil
!
"
rejoined
the
raven
promptly
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
Barnaby
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
said
something
in
a
prayer
;
and
when
you
rose
and
walked
about
,
you
looked
(
as
you
have
done
ever
since
,
mother
,
towards
night
on
my
birthday
)
just
as
you
do
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
found
that
out
,
you
see
,
though
I
am
silly
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
say
you
're
wrong
;
and
this
must
be
my
birthday
---
my
birthday
,
Grip
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
bird
received
this
information
with
a
crow
of
such
duration
as
a
cock
,
gifted
with
intelligence
beyond
all
others
of
his
kind
,
might
usher
in
the
longest
day
with
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
as
if
he
had
well
considered
the
sentiment
,
and
regarded
it
as
apposite
to
birthdays
,
he
cried
,
"
Never
say
die
!
"
<EOS>
a
great
many
times
,
and
flapped
his
wings
for
emphasis
.
  
<EOS>
The
widow
tried
to
make
light
of
Barnaby
's
remark
,
and
endeavoured
to
divert
his
attention
to
some
new
subject
;
too
easy
a
task
at
all
times
,
as
she
knew
.
 
<EOS>
His
supper
done
,
Barnaby
,
regardless
of
her
entreaties
,
stretched
himself
on
the
mat
before
the
fire
;
Grip
perched
upon
his
leg
,
and
divided
his
time
between
dozing
in
the
grateful
warmth
,
and
endeavouring
(
as
it
presently
appeared
)
to
recall
a
new
accomplishment
he
had
been
studying
all
day
.
  
<EOS>
A
long
and
profound
silence
ensued
,
broken
only
by
some
change
of
position
on
the
part
of
Barnaby
,
whose
eyes
were
still
wide
open
and
intently
fixed
upon
the
fire
;
or
by
an
effort
of
recollection
on
the
part
of
Grip
,
who
would
cry
in
a
low
voice
from
time
to
time
,
"
Polly
put
the
ket
---
"
and
there
stop
short
,
forgetting
the
remainder
,
and
go
off
in
a
doze
again
.
  
<EOS>
After
a
long
interval
,
Barnaby
's
breathing
grew
more
deep
and
regular
,
and
his
eyes
were
closed
.
 
<EOS>
But
even
then
the
unquiet
spirit
of
the
raven
interposed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Polly
put
the
ket
---
"
cried
Grip
,
and
his
master
was
broad
awake
again
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
Barnaby
slept
soundly
,
and
the
bird
with
his
bill
sunk
upon
his
breast
,
his
breast
itself
puffed
out
into
a
comfortable
alderman
-
like
form
,
and
his
bright
eye
growing
smaller
and
smaller
,
really
seemed
to
be
subsiding
into
a
state
of
repose
.
 
<EOS>
Now
<EOS>
and
then
he
muttered
in
a
sepulchral
voice
,
"
<EOS>
Polly
put
the
ket
---
"
but
very
drowsily
,
and
more
like
a
drunken
man
than
a
reflecting
raven
.
  
<EOS>
The
widow
,
scarcely
venturing
to
breathe
,
rose
from
her
seat
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
glided
from
the
closet
,
and
extinguished
the
candle
.
  
<EOS>
"
---
tle

"
cried
Grip
,
suddenly
struck
with
an
idea
and
very
much
excited
.
 
<EOS>
"

.
 
<EOS>
Hurrah

"
  
<EOS>
They
stood
rooted
to
the
ground
,
as
though
it
had
been
a
voice
from
the
grave
.
  
<EOS>
But
even
this
failed
to
awaken
the
sleeper
.
 
<EOS>
He
turned
over
towards
the
fire
,
his
arm
fell
to
the
ground
,
and
his
head
drooped
heavily
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
widow
and
her
unwelcome
visitor
gazed
at
him
and
at
each
other
for
a
moment
,
and
then
she
motioned
him
towards
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stay
,
"
he
whispered
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
teach
your
son
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
taught
him
nothing
that
you
heard
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
Depart
instantly
,
or
I
will
rouse
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
free
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
rouse
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
dare
not
do
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
do
anything
,
I
have
told
you
.
 
<EOS>
He
knows
me
well
,
it
seems
.
<EOS>
At
least
I
will
know
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Would
you
kill
him
in
his
sleep
?
"
cried
the
widow
,
throwing
herself
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Woman
,
"
he
returned
between
his
teeth
,
as
he
motioned
her
aside
,
"
I
would
see
him
nearer
,
and
I
will
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
want
one
of
us
to
kill
the
other
,
wake
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
he
advanced
,
and
bending
down
over
the
prostrate
form
,
softly
turned
back
the
head
and
looked
into
the
face
.
 
<EOS>
The
light
of
the
fire
was
upon
it
,
and
its
every
lineament
was
revealed
distinctly
.
 
<EOS>
He
contemplated
it
for
a
brief
space
,
and
hastily
uprose
.
  
<EOS>
"
Observe
,
"
he
whispered
in
the
widow
's
ear
:
"
<EOS>
In
him
,
of
whose
existence
I
was
ignorant
until
to
-
night

I
have
you
in
my
power

<EOS>
Be
careful
how
you
use

Be
careful
how

I

destitute

starving

.
 
<EOS>
I
may
take
a
sure
and
slow
revenge
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
some
dreadful
meaning
in
your
words
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
fathom
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
meaning
in
them
,
and
I
see
you
fathom
it
to
its
very
depth
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
anticipated
it
for
years
;
you
have
told
me
as
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
leave
you
to
digest
it
.
 
<EOS>
Do
not
forget
my
warning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
pointed
,
as
he
left
her
,
to
the
slumbering
form
,
and
stealthily
withdrawing
,
made
his
way
into
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
She
fell
on
her
knees
beside
the
sleeper
,
and
remained
like
one
stricken
into
stone
,
until
the
tears
which
fear
had
frozen
so
long
,
came
tenderly
to
her
relief
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
Thou
,
"
she
cried
,
"
who
hast
taught
me
such
deep
love
for
this
one
remnant
of
the
promise
of
a
happy
life
,
out
of
whose
affliction
,
even
,
perhaps
the
comfort
springs
that
he
is
ever
a
relying
,
loving
child
to
me
---
never
growing
old
or
cold
at
heart
,
but
needing
my
care
and
duty
in
his
manly
strength
as
in
his
cradle
-
time
---
help
him
,
in
his
darkened
walk
through
this
sad
world
,
or
he
is
doomed
,
and
my
poor
heart
is
broken
!

Chapter
18
    
Gliding
along
the
silent
streets
,
and
holding
his
course
where
they
were
darkest
and
most
gloomy
,
the
man
who
had
left
the
widow
's
house
crossed
London
Bridge
,
and
arriving
in
the
City
,
plunged
into
the
backways
,
lanes
,
and
courts
,
between
Cornhill
and
Smithfield
;
with
no
more
fixedness
of
purpose
than
to
lose
himself
among
their
windings
,
and
baffle
pursuit
,
if
any
one
were
dogging
his
steps
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
dead
time
of
the
night
,
and
all
was
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
Now
<EOS>
and
then
a
drowsy
watchman
's
footsteps
sounded
on
the
pavement
,
or
the
lamplighter
on
his
rounds
went
flashing
past
,
leaving
behind
a
little
track
of
smoke
mingled
with
glowing
morsels
of
his
hot
red
link
.
 
<EOS>
He
hid
himself
even
from
these
partakers
of
his
lonely
walk
,
and
,
shrinking
in
some
arch
or
doorway
while
they
passed
,
issued
forth
again
when
they
were
gone
and
so
pursued
his
solitary
way
.
  
<EOS>
To
be
shelterless
and
alone
in
the
open
country
,
hearing
the
wind
moan
and
watching
for
day
through
the
whole
long
weary
night
;
to
listen
to
the
falling
rain
,
and
crouch
for
warmth
beneath
the
lee
of
some
old
barn
or
rick
,
or
in
the
hollow
of
a
tree
;
are
dismal
things
---
but
not
so
dismal
as
the
wandering
up
and
down
where
shelter
is
,
and
beds
and
sleepers
are
by
thousands
;
a
houseless
rejected
creature
.
 
<EOS>
To
pace
the
echoing
stones
from
hour
to
hour
,
counting
the
dull
chimes
of
the
clocks
;
to
watch
the
lights
twinkling
in
chamber
windows
,
to
think
what
happy
forgetfulness
each
house
shuts
in
;
that
here
are
children
coiled
together
in
their
beds
,
here
youth
,
here
age
,
here
poverty
,
here
wealth
,
all
equal
in
their
sleep
,
and
all
at
rest
;
to
have
nothing
in
common
with
the
slumbering
world
around
,
not
even
sleep
,
Heaven
's
gift
to
all
its
creatures
,
and
be
akin
to
nothing
but
despair
;
to
feel
,
by
the
wretched
contrast
with
everything
on
every
hand
,
more
utterly
alone
and
cast
away
than
in
a
trackless
desert
;
this
is
a
kind
of
suffering
,
on
which
the
rivers
of
great
cities
close
full
many
a
time
,
and
which
the
solitude
in
crowds
alone
awakens
.
  
<EOS>
The
miserable
man
paced
up
and
down
the
streets
---
so
long
,
so
wearisome
,
<EOS>
so
like
each
other
---
and
often
cast
a
wistful
look
towards
the
east
,
hoping
to
see
the
first
faint
streaks
of
day
.
<EOS>
But
obdurate
night
had
yet
possession
of
the
sky
,
and
his
disturbed
and
restless
walk
found
no
relief
.
  
<EOS>
One
house
in
a
back
street
was
bright
with
the
cheerful
glare
of
lights
;
there
was
the
sound
of
music
in
it
too
,
and
the
tread
of
dancers
,
and
there
were
cheerful
voices
,
and
many
a
burst
of
laughter
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
place
---
to
be
near
something
that
was
awake
and
glad
---
he
returned
again
and
again
;
and
more
than
one
of
those
who
left
it
when
the
merriment
was
at
its
height
,
felt
it
a
check
upon
their
mirthful
mood
to
see
him
flitting
to
and
fro
like
an
uneasy
ghost
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
the
guests
departed
,
one
and
all
;
and
then
the
house
was
close
shut
up
,
and
became
as
dull
and
silent
as
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
His
wanderings
brought
him
at
one
time
to
the
city
jail
.
 
<EOS>
Instead
of
hastening
from
it
as
a
place
of
ill
omen
,
and
one
he
had
cause
to
shun
,
he
sat
down
on
some
steps
hard
by
,
and
resting
his
chin
upon
his
hand
,
gazed
upon
its
rough
and
frowning
walls
as
though
even
they
became
a
refuge
in
his
jaded
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
He
paced
it
round
and
round
,
came
back
to
the
same
spot
,
and
sat
down
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
this
often
,
and
once
,
with
a
hasty
movement
,
crossed
to
where
some
men
were
watching
in
the
prison
lodge
,
and
had
his
foot
upon
the
steps
as
though
determined
to
accost
them
.
 
<EOS>
But
looking
round
,
he
saw
that
the
day
began
to
break
,
and
failing
in
his
purpose
,
turned
and
fled
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
soon
in
the
quarter
he
had
lately
traversed
,
and
pacing
to
and
fro
again
as
he
had
done
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
passing
down
a
mean
street
,
when
from
an
alley
close
at
hand
some
shouts
of
revelry
arose
,
and
there
came
straggling
forth
a
dozen
madcaps
,
whooping
and
calling
to
each
other
,
who
,
parting
noisily
,
took
different
ways
and
dispersed
in
smaller
groups
.
  
<EOS>
Hoping
that
some
low
place
of
entertainment
which
would
afford
him
a
safe
refuge
might
be
near
at
hand
,
he
turned
into
this
court
when
they
were
all
gone
,
and
looked
about
for
a
half
-
opened
door
,
or
lighted
window
,
or
other
indication
of
<EOS>
the
place
whence
they
had
come
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
so
profoundly
dark
,
however
,
and
so
ill
-
favoured
,
that
he
concluded
they
had
but
turned
up
there
,
missing
their
way
,
and
were
pouring
out
again
when
he
observed
them
.
 
<EOS>
With
this
impression
,
and
finding
there
was
no
outlet
but
that
by
which
he
had
entered
,
he
was
about
to
turn
,
when
from
a
grating
near
his
feet
a
sudden
stream
of
light
appeared
,
and
the
sound
of
talking
came
.
 
<EOS>
He
retreated
into
a
doorway
to
see
who
these
talkers
were
,
and
to
listen
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
The
light
came
to
the
level
of
the
pavement
as
he
did
this
,
and
a
man
ascended
,
bearing
in
his
hand
a
torch
.
 
<EOS>
This
figure
unlocked
and
held
open
the
grating
as
for
the
passage
of
another
,
who
presently
appeared
,
in
the
form
of
a
young
man
of
small
stature
and
uncommon
self
-
importance
,
dressed
in
an
obsolete
and
very
gaudy
fashion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
night
,
noble
captain
,
"
said
he
with
the
torch
.
 
<EOS>
"
Farewell
,
commander
.
 
<EOS>
Good
luck
,
illustrious
general
!
"
  
<EOS>
In
return
to
these
compliments
the
other
bade
him
hold
his
tongue
,
and
keep
his
noise
to
himself
,
and
laid
upon
him
many
similar
injunctions
,
with
great
fluency
of
speech
and
sternness
of
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
Commend
me
,
captain
,
to
the
stricken
Miggs
,
"
returned
the
torch
-
bearer
in
a
lower
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
captain
flies
at
higher
game
than
Miggses
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
My
captain
is
an
eagle
,
both
as
respects
his
eye
and
soaring
wings
.
 
<EOS>
My
captain
breaketh
hearts
as
other
bachelors
break
eggs
at
breakfast
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
fool
you
are
,
Stagg
!
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
,
stepping
on
the
pavement
of
the
court
,
and
brushing
from
his
legs
the
dust
he
had
contracted
in
his
passage
upward
.
  
<EOS>
"
His
precious
limbs
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Stagg
,
clasping
one
of
his
ankles
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
a
Miggs
aspire
to
these
proportions
!
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
my
captain
.
<EOS>
We
will
inveigle
ladies
fair
,
and
we
d
them
in
our
secret
cavern
.
<EOS>
We
will
unite
ourselves
with
blooming
beauties
,
captain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
my
buck
,
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
,
releasing
his
leg
;
"
I
'll
trouble
you
not
to
take
liberties
,
and
not
to
broach
certain
questions
unless
certain
questions
are
broached
to
you
.
<EOS>
Speak
when
you
're
spoke
to
on
particular
subjects
,
and
not
otherways
.
 
<EOS>
Hold
the
torch
up
till
I
've
got
to
the
end
of
the
court
,
and
then
kennel
yourself
,
do
you
hear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hear
you
,
noble
captain
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Obey
then
,
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
haughtily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
lead
on
!
"
<EOS>
With
which
word
of
command
(
addressed
to
an
imaginary
staff
or
retinue
)
<EOS>
he
folded
his
arms
,
and
walked
with
surpassing
dignity
down
the
court
.
  
<EOS>
His
obsequious
follower
stood
holding
the
torch
above
his
head
,
and
then
the
observer
saw
for
the
first
time
,
from
his
place
of
concealment
,
that
he
was
blind
.
 
<EOS>
Some
involuntary
motion
on
his
part
caught
the
quick
ear
of
the
blind
man
,
before
he
was
conscious
of
having
moved
an
inch
towards
him
,
for
he
turned
suddenly
and
cried
,
<EOS>
"
Who
's
there
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
man
,
"
said
the
other
,
advancing
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
stranger
!
<EOS>
"
rejoined
the
blind
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Strangers
are
not
my
friends
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
do
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
saw
your
company
come
out
,
and
waited
here
till
they
were
gone
.
<EOS>
I
want
a
lodging
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
lodging
at
this
time
!
"
returned
Stagg
,
pointing
towards
the
dawn
as
though
he
saw
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
the
day
is
breaking
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
,
"
rejoined
the
other
,
"
to
my
cost
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
traversing
this
iron
-
hearted
town
all
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
traverse
it
again
,
"
said
the
blind
man
,
preparing
to
descend
,
"
till
you
find
some
lodgings
suitable
to
your
taste
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
let
any
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Stay
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
other
,
holding
him
by
the
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
beat
this
light
about
that
hangdog
face
of
yours
(
for
hangdog
it
is
,
if
it
answers
to
your
voice
)
,
and
rouse
the
neighbourhood
besides
,
if
you
detain
me
,

said
the
blind
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
go
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
YOU
hear
!
"
returned
the
other
,
chinking
a
few
shillings
together
,
and
hurriedly
pressing
them
into
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
beg
nothing
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
pay
for
the
shelter
you
give
me
.
 
<EOS>
Death
!
<EOS>
Is
it
much
to
ask
of
such
as
you
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
come
from
the
country
,
and
desire
to
rest
where
there
are
none
to
question
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
faint
,
exhausted
,
worn
out
,
almost
dead
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
lie
down
,
like
a
dog
,
before
your
fire
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
no
more
than
that
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
would
be
rid
of
me
,
I
will
depart
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
a
gentleman
has
been
unfortunate
on
the
road
,
"
muttered
Stagg
,
yielding
to
the
other
,
who
,
pressing
on
him
,
had
already
gained
a
footing
on
the
steps
---
"
and
can
pay
for
his
accommodation
---
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
pay
you
with
all
I
have
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
just
now
past
the
want
of
food
,
God
knows
,
and
wish
but
to
purchase
shelter
.
 
<EOS>
What
companion
have
you
below
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
fasten
your
grate
there
,
and
show
me
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
Quick
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
blind
man
complied
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
and
they
descended
together
.
 
<EOS>
The
dialogue
had
passed
as
hurriedly
as
the
words
could
be
spoken
,
and
they
stood
in
his
wretched
room
before
he
had
had
time
to
recover
from
his
first
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
see
where
that
door
leads
to
,
and
what
is
beyond
?
"
said
the
man
,
glancing
keenly
round
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
mind
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
show
you
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Follow
me
,
or
go
before
.
 
<EOS>
Take
your
choice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
bade
him
lead
the
way
,
and
,
by
the
light
of
the
torch
which
his
conductor
held
up
for
the
purpose
,
inspected
all
three
cellars
narrowly
.
 
<EOS>
Assured
that
the
blind
man
had
spoken
truth
,
and
that
he
lived
there
alone
,
the
visitor
returned
with
him
to
the
first
,
in
which
a
fire
was
burning
,
and
flung
himself
with
a
deep
groan
upon
the
ground
before
it
.
  
<EOS>
His
host
pursued
his
usual
occupation
without
seeming
to
heed
him
any
further
.
 
<EOS>
But
directly
he
fell
asleep
---
and
he
noted
his
falling
into
a
slumber
,
as
readily
as
the
keenest
-
sighted
man
could
have
done
<EOS>
---
he
knelt
down
beside
him
,
and
passed
his
hand
lightly
but
carefully
over
his
face
and
person
.
  
<EOS>
His
sleep
was
checkered
with
starts
and
moans
,
and
sometimes
with
a
muttered
word
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
His
hands
were
clenched
,
his
brow
bent
,
and
his
mouth
firmly
set
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
,
the
blind
man
accurately
marked
;
and
as
if
his
curiosity
were
strongly
awakened
,
and
he
had
already
some
inkling
of
his
mystery
,
he
sat
watching
him
,
if
the
expression
may
be
used
,
and
listening
,
until
it
was
broad
day

Chapter
19
    
Dolly
Varden
's
pretty
little
head
was
yet
bewildered
by
various
recollections
of
the
party
,
and
her
bright
eyes
were
yet
dazzled
by
a
crowd
of
images
,
dancing
before
them
like
motes
in
the
sunbeams
,
among
which
the
effigy
of
one
partner
in
particular
did
especially
figure
,
the
same
being
a
young
coachmaker
(
a
master
in
his
own
right
)
who
had
given
her
to
understand
,
when
he
handed
her
into
the
chair
at
parting
,
that
it
was
his
fixed
resolve
to
neglect
his
business
from
that
time
,
and
die
slowly
for
the
love
of
her
---
 
<EOS>
Dolly
's
head
,
and
eyes
,
and
thoughts
,
and
seven
senses
,
were
all
in
a
state
of
flutter
and
confusion
for
which
the
party
was
accountable
,
although
it
was
now
three
days
old
,
when
,
as
she
was
sitting
listlessly
at
breakfast
,
reading
all
manner
of
fortunes
(
that
is
to
say
,
of
married
and
flourishing
fortunes
)
<EOS>
in
the
grounds
of
her
teacup
,
a
step
was
heard
in
the
workshop
,
and
Mr
Edward
Chester
was
descried
through
the
glass
door
,
standing
among
the
rusty
locks
and
keys
,
like
love
among
the
roses
---
for
which
apt
comparison
the
historian
may
by
no
means
take
any
credit
to
himself
,
the
same
being
the
invention
,
in
a
sentimental
mood
,
of
the
chaste
and
modest
Miggs
,
who
,
beholding
him
from
the
doorsteps
<EOS>
she
was
then
cleaning
,
did
,
in
her
maiden
meditation
,
give
utterance
to
the
simile
.
  
<EOS>
The
locksmith
,
who
happened
at
the
moment
to
have
his
eyes
thrown
upward
and
his
head
backward
,
in
an
intense
communing
with
Toby
,
did
not
see
his
visitor
,
until
Mrs
Varden
,
more
watchful
than
the
rest
,
had
desired
Sim
Tappertit
to
open
the
glass
door
and
give
him
admission
---
from
which
untoward
circumstance
the
good
lady
argued
(
for
she
could
deduce
a
precious
moral
from
the
most
trifling
event
)
<EOS>
that
to
take
a
draught
of
small
ale
in
the
morning
was
to
observe
a
pernicious
,
irreligious
,
and
Pagan
custom
,
the
relish
whereof
should
be
left
to
swine
,
and
Satan
,
or
at
least
to
Popish
persons
,
and
should
be
shunned
by
the
righteous
as
a
work
of
sin
and
evil
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
no
doubt
have
pursued
her
admonition
much
further
,
and
would
have
founded
on
it
a
long
list
of
precious
precepts
of
inestimable
value
,
but
that
the
young
gentleman
standing
by
in
a
somewhat
uncomfortable
and
discomfited
manner
while
she
read
her
spouse
<EOS>
this
lecture
,
occasioned
her
to
bring
it
to
a
premature
conclusion
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
you
'll
excuse
me
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Varden
,
rising
and
curtseying
.
 
<EOS>
"
Varden
is
so
very
thoughtless
,
and
needs
so
much
reminding
---
<EOS>
Sim
,
bring
a
chair
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Tappertit
obeyed
,
with
a
flourish
implying
that
he
did
so
,
under
protest
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
can
go
,
Sim
,
"
said
the
locksmith
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Tappertit
obeyed
again
,
still
under
protest
;
and
betaking
himself
to
the
workshop
,
began
seriously
to
fear
that
he
might
find
it
necessary
to
poison
his
master
,
before
his
time
was
out
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
Edward
returned
suitable
replies
to
Mrs
Varden
's
courtesies
,
and
that
lady
brightened
up
very
much
;
so
that
when
he
accepted
a
dish
of
tea
from
the
fair
hands
of
Dolly
,
she
was
perfectly
agreeable
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
if
there
's
anything
we
can
do
,
---
Varden
,
or
I
,
or
Dolly
either
,
---
to
serve
you
,
sir
,
at
any
time
,
you
have
only
to
say
it
,
and
it
shall
be
done
,
"
said
Mrs
V.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
,
I
am
sure
,
"
returned
Edward
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
encourage
me
to
say
that
I
have
come
here
now
,
to
beg
your
good
offices
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
was
delighted
beyond
measure
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
occurred
to
me
that
probably
your
fair
daughter
might
be
going
to
the
Warren
,
either
to
-
day
or
to
-
morrow
,
"
said
Edward
,
glancing
at
Dolly
;
"
and
if
so
,
and
you
will
allow
her
to
take
charge
of
this
letter
,
ma'am
,
you
will
oblige
me
more
than
I
can
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
that
while
I
am
very
anxious
it
should
reach
its
destination
,
I
have
particular
reasons
for
not
trusting
it
to
any
other
conveyance
;
so
that
without
your
help
,
I
am
wholly
at
a
loss
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
was
not
going
that
way
,
sir
,
either
to
-
day
,
or
to
-
morrow
,
nor
indeed
<EOS>
all
next
week
,
"
the
lady
graciously
rejoined
,
"
but
we
shall
be
very
glad
to
put
ourselves
out
of
the
way
on
your
account
,
and
if
you
wish
it
,
you
may
depend
upon
its
going
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
You
might
suppose
,
"
said
Mrs
Varden
,
frowning
at
her
husband
,
"
from
Varden
's
sitting
there
<EOS>
so
glum
and
silent
<EOS>
,
that
he
objected
to
this
arrangement
;
but
you
must
not
mind
that
,
sir
,
if
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
his
way
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
Out
of
doors
,
he
can
be
cheerful
and
talkative
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
Now
,
the
fact
was
,
that
the
unfortunate
locksmith
,
blessing
his
stars
to
find
his
helpmate
in
such
good
humour
,
had
been
sitting
with
a
beaming
face
,
hearing
this
discourse
with
a
joy
past
all
expression
.
 
<EOS>
Wherefore
<EOS>
this
sudden
attack
quite
took
him
by
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Martha
---
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
I
dare
say
,
"
interrupted
Mrs
Varden
,
with
a
smile
of
mingled
scorn
and
pleasantry
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
dear
!
 
<EOS>
We
all
know
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
but
my
good
soul
,
"
said
Gabriel
,
"
you
are
quite
mistaken
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
delighted
to
find
you
so
kind
and
ready
.
 
<EOS>
I
waited
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
anxiously
,
I
assure
you
,
to
hear
what
you
would
say
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
waited
anxiously
,
"
repeated
Mrs
V.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
 
<EOS>
Thank
you
,
Varden
.
<EOS>
You
waited
,
as
you
always
do
,
that
I
might
bear
the
blame
,
if
any
came
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
used
to
it
,
"
said
the
lady
with
a
kind
of
solemn
titter
,
"
and
that
's
my
comfort
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
give
you
my
word
,
Martha
---
"
said
Gabriel
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
give
you
MY
word
,
my
dear
,
"
interposed
his
wife
with
a
Christian
smile
,
"
that
such
discussions
as
these
between
married
people
,
are
much
better
left
alone
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
if
you
please
,
Varden
,
we
'll
drop
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
wish
to
pursue
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
I
might
say
a
great
deal
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
would
rather
not
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
do
n't
say
any
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
to
say
any
more
,
"
rejoined
the
goaded
locksmith
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
then
,
do
n't
,
"
said
Mrs
Varden
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
did
I
begin
it
,
Martha
,
"
added
the
locksmith
,
good
-
humouredly
,
"
I
must
say
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
did
not
begin
it
,
Varden
!
"
exclaimed
his
wife
,
opening
her
eyes
very
wide
and
looking
round
upon
the
company
,
as
though
she
would
say
,
You
hear
this
man
!
 
<EOS>
"
You
did
not
begin
it
,
Varden
!
 
<EOS>
But
you
shall
not
say
I
was
out
of
temper
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
you
did
not
begin
it
,
<EOS>
oh
dear
<EOS>
no
,
not
you
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
"
said
the
locksmith
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
settled
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
yes
,
"
rejoined
his
wife
,
"
quite
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
like
to
say
Dolly
began
it
,
my
dear
,
I
shall
not
contradict
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
my
duty
.
 
<EOS>
I
need
know
it
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
often
obliged
to
bear
it
in
mind
,
when
my
inclination
perhaps
would
be
for
the
moment
to
forget
it
.
<EOS>
Thank
you
,
Varden
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
so
,
with
a
mighty
show
of
humility
and
forgiveness
,
she
folded
her
hands
,
and
looked
round
again
,
with
a
smile
which
plainly
said
,
"
If
you
desire
to
see
the
first
and
foremost
among
female
martyrs
,
here
she
is
,
on
view
!
"
  
<EOS>
This
little
incident
,
illustrative
though
it
was
of
Mrs
Varden
's
extraordinary
sweetness
and
amiability
,
had
so
strong
a
tendency
to
check
the
conversation
and
to
disconcert
all
parties
but
<EOS>
that
excellent
lady
,
that
only
a
few
monosyllables
were
uttered
until
Edward
withdrew
;
which
he
presently
did
,
thanking
the
lady
of
the
house
a
great
many
times
for
her
condescension
,
and
whispering
in
Dolly
's
ear
that
he
would
call
on
the
morrow
,
in
case
there
should
happen
to
be
an
answer
to
the
note
---
which
,
indeed
,
she
knew
without
his
telling
,
as
Barnaby
and
his
friend
Grip
had
dropped
in
on
the
previous
night
to
prepare
her
for
the
visit
which
was
then
terminating
.
  
<EOS>
Gabriel
,
who
had
attended
Edward
to
the
door
,
came
back
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
;
and
,
after
fidgeting
about
the
room
in
a
very
uneasy
manner
,
and
casting
a
great
many
sidelong
looks
at
Mrs
Varden
(
who
with
the
calmest
countenance
in
the
world
was
five
fathoms
deep
in
the
Protestant
Manual
)
,
inquired
of
Dolly
how
she
meant
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
Dolly
supposed
by
the
stage
-
coach
,
and
looked
at
her
lady
mother
,
who
finding
herself
silently
appealed
to
,
dived
down
at
least
another
fathom
into
the
Manual
,
and
became
unconscious
of
all
earthly
things
.
  
<EOS>
"
Martha
---
"
said
the
locksmith
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hear
you
,
Varden
,
"
said
his
wife
,
without
rising
to
the
surface
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
,
my
dear
,
you
have
such
an
objection
to
the
Maypole
and
old
John
,
for
otherways
as
it
's
a
very
fine
morning
,
and
Saturday
's
not
a
busy
day
with
us
,
we
might
have
all
three
gone
to
Chigwell
in
the
chaise
,
and
had
quite
a
happy
day
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
immediately
closed
the
Manual
,
and
bursting
into
tears
,
requested
to
be
led
upstairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
now
,
Martha
?
"
inquired
the
locksmith
.
  
<EOS>
To
which
Martha
rejoined
,
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
do
n't
speak
to
me
,
"
and
protested
in
agony
that
if
anybody
had
told
her
so
,
she
would
n't
have
believed
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
Martha
,
"
said
Gabriel
,
putting
himself
in
the
way
as
she
was
moving
off
with
the
aid
of
Dolly
's
shoulder
,
"
would
n't
have
believed
what
?
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
what
's
wrong
now
.
 
<EOS>
Do
tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
my
soul
I
do
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
,
child
?
 
<EOS>
Damme
!
"
cried
the
locksmith
,
plucking
at
his
wig
in
a
kind
of
frenzy
,
"
nobody
does
know
,
I
verily
believe
,
but
Miggs
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miggs
,
"
said
Mrs
Varden
faintly
,
and
with
symptoms
of
approaching
incoherence
,
"
is
attached
to
me
,
and
that
is
sufficient
to
draw
down
hatred
upon
her
in
this
house
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
a
comfort
to
me
,
whatever
she
may
be
to
others
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
no
comfort
to
me
,
"
cried
Gabriel
,
made
bold
by
despair
.
<EOS>
"
She
's
the
misery
of
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
She
's
all
the
plagues
of
Egypt
in
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
considered
so
<EOS>
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
"
said
Mrs
Varden
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
prepared
for
that
;
it
's
natural
;
it
's
of
a
piece
with
the
rest
.
<EOS>
When
you
taunt
me
as
you
do
to
my
face
,
how
can
I
wonder
that
you
taunt
her
behind
her
back
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
here
the
incoherence
coming
on
very
strong
,
Mrs
Varden
wept
,
and
laughed
,
and
sobbed
,
and
shivered
,
and
hiccoughed
,
and
choked
;
and
said
she
knew
it
was
very
foolish
<EOS>
but
she
could
n't
help
it
;
and
that
when
she
was
dead
and
gone
,
perhaps
they
would
be
sorry
for
it
---
which
really
under
the
circumstances
did
not
appear
quite
so
probable
as
she
seemed
to
think
---
with
a
great
deal
more
to
the
same
effect
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
she
passed
with
great
decency
through
all
the
ceremonies
incidental
to
such
occasions
;
and
being
supported
upstairs
,
was
deposited
in
a
highly
spasmodic
state
on
her
own
bed
,
where
Miss
Miggs
shortly
afterwards
flung
herself
upon
the
body
.
  
<EOS>
The
philosophy
of
all
this
was
,
that
Mrs
Varden
wanted
to
go
to
Chigwell
;
that
she
did
not
want
to
make
any
concession
or
explanation
;
that
she
would
only
go
on
being
implored
and
entreated
so
to
do
;
and
that
she
would
accept
no
other
terms
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
after
a
vast
amount
of
moaning
and
crying
upstairs
,
and
much
damping
of
foreheads
,
and
vinegaring
of
temples
,
and
hartshorning
of
noses
,
and
so
forth
;
and
after
most
pathetic
adjurations
from
Miggs
,
assisted
by
warm
brandy
-
and
-
water
not
over
-
weak
,
and
divers
other
cordials
,
also
of
a
stimulating
quality
,
administered
at
first
in
teaspoonfuls
and
afterwards
in
increasing
doses
,
and
of
which
Miss
Miggs
herself
partook
as
a
preventive
measure
(
for
fainting
is
infectious
)
;
after
all
these
remedies
,
and
many
more
too
numerous
to
mention
,
but
not
to
take
,
had
been
applied
;
and
many
verbal
consolations
,
moral
,
religious
,
and
miscellaneous
,
had
been
super
-
added
thereto
;
the
locksmith
humbled
himself
,
and
the
end
was
gained
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
it
's
only
for
the
sake
of
peace
and
quietness
,
father
,
"
said
Dolly
,
urging
him
to
go
upstairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Doll
,
Doll
,
"
said
her
good
-
natured
father
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
ever
have
a
husband
of
your
own
---
"
  
Dolly
glanced
at
the
glass
.
  
<EOS>
"
---
Well
,
WHEN
you
have
,
"
said
the
locksmith
,
"
never
faint
,
my
darling
.
 
<EOS>
More
domestic
unhappiness
has
come
of
easy
fainting
,
Doll
,
than
from
all
the
greater
passions
put
together
.
 
<EOS>
Remember
that
,
my
dear
,
if
you
would
be
really
happy
,
which
you
never
can
be
,
if
your
husband
is
n't
.
 
<EOS>
And
a
word
in
your
ear
,
my
precious
.
<EOS>
Never
have
a
Miggs
about
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
this
advice
he
kissed
his
blooming
daughter
on
the
cheek
,
and
slowly
repaired
to
Mrs
Varden
's
room
;
where
that
lady
,
lying
all
pale
and
languid
on
her
couch
,
was
refreshing
herself
with
a
sight
of
her
last
new
bonnet
,
which
Miggs
,
as
a
means
of
calming
her
scattered
spirits
,
displayed
to
the
best
advantage
at
her
bedside
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
's
master
,
mim
,
"
said
Miggs
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
what
a
happiness
it
is
when
man
and
wife
come
round
again
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
gracious
,
to
think
that
him
and
her
should
ever
have
a
word
together
!
"
 
<EOS>
In
the
energy
of
these
sentiments
,
which
were
uttered
as
an
apostrophe
to
the
Heavens
in
general
,
Miss
Miggs
perched
the
bonnet
on
the
top
of
her
own
head
,
and
folding
her
hands
,
turned
on
her
tears
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
help
it
,
"
cried
Miggs
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
,
if
I
was
to
be
drownded
in
'em
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
such
a
forgiving
spirit
!
 
<EOS>
She
'll
forget
all
that
has
passed
,
and
go
along
with
you
,
sir
---
<EOS>
Oh
,
if
it
was
to
the
world
's
end
,
she
'd
go
along
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
with
a
faint
smile
gently
reproved
her
attendant
for
this
enthusiasm
,
and
reminded
her
at
the
same
time
that
she
was
far
too
unwell
to
venture
out
that
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
you
're
not
,
mim
,
indeed
you
're
not
,
"
said
Miggs
;
"
I
repeal
to
master
;
master
knows
you
're
not

mim

<EOS>
The
hair
,
and
motion
of

do
you
good

and
you
must
not
give

you

<EOS>
She
must
keep
up
,
must
n't
she
,
sir
,
for
all
out
sakes
?
 
<EOS>
I
was
a
telling
her
<EOS>
that
,
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
She
must
remember
us
,
even
if
she
forgets
herself
.
 
<EOS>
Master
will
persuade
you

,
I
'm
sure
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
Miss
Dolly
's
<EOS>
a

going
you
know
,
and
master
,
and
you
,
and
all
so
happy
and
so
comfortable
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
"
cried
Miggs
,
turning
on
the
tears
again
,
previous
to
quitting
the
room
in
great
emotion
<EOS>
,
"
I
never
see
such
a
blessed
one
as
she
is
for
the
forgiveness
of
her
spirit
,
I
never
,
never
,
never
did
.
 
<EOS>
Not
more
did
master
neither
;
no
,
nor
no
one
---
never
!
"
  
<EOS>
For
five
minutes
or
thereabouts
,
Mrs
Varden
remained
mildly
opposed
to
all
her
husband
's
prayers
that
she
would
oblige
him
by
taking
a
day
's
pleasure
,
but
relenting
at
length
,
she
suffered
herself
to
be
persuaded
,
and
granting
him
her
free
forgiveness
(
the
merit
whereof
,
she
meekly
said
,
rested
with
the
Manual
and
not
with
her
)
,
desired
that
Miggs
might
come
and
help
her
dress
.
 
<EOS>
The
handmaid
attended
promptly
,
and
it
is
but
justice
to
their
joint
exertions
to
record
that
,
when
the
good
lady
came
downstairs
in
course
of
time
,
completely
decked
out
for
the
journey
<EOS>
,
she
really
looked
as
if
nothing
had
happened
,
and
appeared
in
the
very
best
health
imaginable
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
Dolly
,
there
she
was
again
,
the
very
pink
and
pattern
of
good
looks
,
in
a
smart
little
cherry
-
coloured
mantle
,
with
a
hood
of
the
same
drawn
over
her
head
,
and
upon
the
top
of
that
hood
,
a
little
straw
hat
trimmed
with
cherry
-
coloured
ribbons
,
and
worn
the
merest
trifle
on
one
side
---
just
enough
in
short
to
make
it
the
wickedest
and
most
provoking
head
-
dress
that
ever
malicious
milliner
devised
.
 
<EOS>
And
not
to
speak
of
the
manner
in
which
these
cherry
-
coloured
decorations
brightened
her
eyes
,
or
vied
with
her
lips
,
or
shed
a
new
bloom
on
her
face
,
she
wore
such
a
cruel
little
muff
,
and
such
a
heart
-
rending
pair
of
shoes
,
and
was
so
surrounded
and
hemmed
in
,
as
it
were
,
by
aggravations
of
all
kinds
,
that
when
Mr
Tappettit
,
holding
the
horse
's
head
,
saw
her
come
out
of
the
house
alone
,
such
impulses
came
over
him
to
decoy
her
into
the
chaise
and
drive
off
like
mad
,
that
he
would
unquestionably
have
done
it
,
but
for
certain
uneasy
doubts
besetting
him
as
to
the
shortest
way
to
Gretna
Green
;
whether
it
was
up
the
street
or
down
,
or
up
the
right
-
hand
turning
or
the
left
;
and
whether
,
supposing
all
the
turnpikes
to
be
carried
by
storm
,
the
blacksmith
in
the
end
would
marry
them
on
credit
;
which
by
reason
of
his
clerical
office
appeared
,
even
to
his
excited
imagination
,
so
unlikely
,
that
he
hesitated
.
 
<EOS>
And
while
he
stood
hesitating
,
and
looking
post
-
chaises
-
and
-
six
at
Dolly
,
out
came
his
master
and
his
mistress
,
and
the
constant
Miggs
,
and
<EOS>
the
opportunity
was
gone
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
For
now
the
chaise
creaked
upon
its
springs
,
and
Mrs
Varden
was
inside
;
and
now
it
creaked
again
,
and
more
than
ever
,
and
the
locksmith
was
inside
;
and
now
it
bounded
once
,
as
if
its
heart
beat
lightly
,
and
Dolly
was
inside
;
and
now
it
was
gone
and
its
place
was
empty
,
and
he
and
that
dreary
Miggs
were
standing
in
the
street
together
.
  
<EOS>
The
hearty
locksmith
was
in
as
good
a
humour
as
if
nothing
had
occurred
for
the
last
twelve
months
to
put
him
out
of
his
way
,
Dolly
was
all
smiles
and
graces
,
and
Mrs
Varden
was
agreeable
beyond
all
precedent
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
jogged
through
the
streets
talking
of
this
thing
and
of
that
,
who
should
be
descried
upon
the
pavement
but
<EOS>
that
very
coachmaker
,
looking
so
genteel
that
nobody
would
have
believed
he
had
ever
had
anything
to
do
with
a
coach
but
riding
in
it
,
and
bowing
like
any
nobleman
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
Dolly
was
confused
when
she
bowed
again
,
and
to
be
sure
the
cherry
-
coloured
ribbons
trembled
a
little
when
she
met
his
mournful
eye
,
which
seemed
to
say
,
"
I
have
kept
my
word
,
I
have
begun
,
the
business
is
going
to
the
devil
,
and
you
're
the
cause
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
There
he
stood
,
rooted
to
the
ground
:
as
Dolly
said
,
like
a
statue
;
and
as
Mrs
Varden
said
,
like
a
pump
;
till
they
turned
the
corner
:
and
when
her
father
thought
it
was
like
his
impudence
,
and
her
mother
wondered
what
he
meant
by
it
,
Dolly
blushed
again
till
her
very
hood
was
pale
.
  
<EOS>
But
on
they
went
,
not
the
less
merrily
for
this
,
and
there
was
the
locksmith
in
the
incautious
fulness
of
his
heart
"
pulling
-
up
"
at
all
manner
of
places
,
and
evincing
a
most
intimate
acquaintance
with
all
the
taverns
on
the
road
,
and
all
the
landlords
and
all
the
landladies
,
with
whom
,
indeed
,
the
little
horse
was
on
equally
friendly
terms
,
for
he
kept
on
stopping
of
his
own
accord
.
 
<EOS>
Never
were
people
so
glad
to
see
other
people
as
these
landlords
and
landladies
were
to
behold
Mr
Varden
and
Mrs
Varden
and
Miss
Varden
;
and
would
n't
they
get
out
,
said
one
;
and
they
really
must
walk
upstairs
,
said
another
;
and
she
would
take
it
ill
and
be
quite
certain
they
were
proud
if
they
would
n't
have
a
little
taste
of
something
,
said
a
third
;
and
so
on
,
that
it
was
really
quite
a
Progress
rather
than
a
ride
,
and
one
continued
scene
of
hospitality
from
beginning
to
end
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
pleasant
enough
to
be
held
in
such
esteem
,
not
to
mention
the
refreshments
;
so
Mrs
Varden
said
nothing
at
the
time
,
and
was
all
affability
and
delight
---
but
such
a
body
of
evidence
as
she
collected
against
the
unfortunate
locksmith
that
day
,
to
be
used
thereafter
as
occasion
might
require
,
never
was
got
together
for
matrimonial
purposes
.
  
<EOS>
In
course
of
time
---
and
in
course
of
a
pretty
long
time
too
,
for
these
agreeable
interruptions
delayed
them
not
a
little
,
---
they
arrived
upon
the
skirts
of
the
Forest
,
and
riding
pleasantly
on
among
the
trees
,
came
at
last
to
the
Maypole
,
where
the
locksmith
's
cheerful
"
Yoho
!
"
<EOS>
speedily
brought
to
the
porch
old
John
,
and
after
him
young
Joe
,
both
of
whom
were
so
transfixed
at
sight
of
the
ladies
,
that
for
a
moment
they
were
perfectly
unable
to
give
them
any
welcome
,
and
could
do
nothing
but
stare
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
only
for
a
moment
,
however
,
that
Joe
forgot
himself
,
for
speedily
reviving
<EOS>
he
thrust
his
drowsy
father
aside
---
to
Mr
Willet
's
mighty
and
inexpressible
indignation
---
and
darting
out
,
stood
ready
to
help
them
to
alight
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
necessary
for
Dolly
to
get
out
first
.
 
<EOS>
Joe
had
her
in
his
arms
;
---
yes
,
though
for
a
space
of
time
no
longer
than
you
could
count
one
in
,
Joe
had
her
in
his
arms
.
<EOS>
Here
was
a
glimpse
of
happiness
!
  
<EOS>
It
would
be
difficult
to
describe
what
a
flat
and
commonplace
affair
<EOS>
the
helping
Mrs
Varden
out
afterwards
was
,
but
Joe
did
it
,
and
did
it
too
with
the
best
grace
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
Then
old
John
,
who
,
entertaining
a
dull
and
foggy
sort
of
idea
that
Mrs
Varden
was
n't
fond
of
him
,
had
been
in
some
doubt
whether
she
might
not
have
come
for
purposes
of
assault
and
battery
,
took
courage
,
hoped
she
was
well
,
and
offered
to
conduct
her
into
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
This
tender
being
amicably
received
,
they
marched
in
together
;
Joe
and
Dolly
followed
,
arm
-
in
-
arm
,
(
happiness
again
!
)
<EOS>
and
Varden
brought
up
the
rear
.
  
<EOS>
Old
John
would
have
it
that
they
must
sit
in
the
bar
,
and
nobody
objecting
,
into
the
bar
they
went
.
 
<EOS>
All
bars
are
snug
places
,
but
the
Maypole
's
was
the
very
snuggest
,
cosiest
,
and
completest
bar
,
that
ever
the
wit
of
man
devised
.
 
<EOS>
Such
amazing
bottles
in
old
oaken
pigeon
-
holes
;
such
gleaming
tankards
dangling
from
pegs
at
about
the
same
inclination
as
thirsty
men
would
hold
them
to
their
lips
;
such
sturdy
little
Dutch
kegs
ranged
in
rows
on
shelves
;
so
many
lemons
hanging
in
separate
nets
,
and
forming
the
fragrant
grove
already
mentioned
in
this
chronicle
,
suggestive
,
with
goodly
loaves
of
snowy
sugar
stowed
away
hard
by
,
of
punch
,
idealised
beyond
all
mortal
knowledge
;
such
closets
,
such
presses
,
such
drawers
full
of
pipes
,
such
places
for
putting
things
away
in
hollow
window
-
seats
,
all
crammed
to
the
throat
with
eatables
,
drinkables
,
or
savoury
condiments
;
lastly
,
and
to
crown
all
,
as
typical
of
the
immense
resources
of
the
establishment
,
and
its
defiances
to
all
visitors
to
cut
and
come
again
,
such
a
stupendous
cheese
!
  
<EOS>
It
is
a
poor
heart
that
never
rejoices
<EOS>
---
it
must
have
been
the
poorest
,
weakest
,
and
most
watery
heart
that
ever
beat
,
which
would
not
have
warmed
towards
the
Maypole
bar
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
's
did
directly
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
no
more
have
reproached
John
Willet
among
those
household
gods
,
the
kegs
and
bottles
,
lemons
,
pipes
,
and
cheese
,
than
she
could
have
stabbed
him
with
his
own
bright
carving
-
knife
.
 
<EOS>
The
order
for
dinner
too
<EOS>
---
it
might
have
soothed
a
savage
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
bit
of
fish
,
"
said
John
to
the
cook
,
"
and
some
lamb
chops
(
breaded
,
with
plenty
of
ketchup
)
,
and
a
good
salad
,
and
a
roast
spring
chicken
,
with
a
dish
of
sausages
and
mashed
potatoes
,
or
something
of
that
sort
.
"
 
<EOS>
Something
of
that
sort
!
 
<EOS>
The
resources
of
these
inns
!
 
<EOS>
To
talk
carelessly
about
dishes
,
which
in
themselves
were
a
first
-
rate
holiday
kind
of
dinner
,
suitable
to
one
's
wedding
-
day
,
as
something
of
that
sort
:
<EOS>
meaning
,
if
you
ca
n't
get
a
spring
chicken
,
any
other
trifle
in
the
way
of
poultry
will
do
---
such
as
a
peacock
,
perhaps
!
 
<EOS>
The
kitchen
too
,
with
its
great
broad
cavernous
chimney
;
the
kitchen
,
where
nothing
in
the
way
of
cookery
seemed
impossible
;
where
you
could
believe
in
anything
to
eat
,
they
chose
to
tell
you
of
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
returned
from
the
contemplation
of
these
wonders
to
the
bar
again
,
with
a
head
quite
dizzy
and
bewildered
.
 
<EOS>
Her
housekeeping
capacity
was
not
large
enough
to
comprehend
them
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
obliged
to
go
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
Waking
was
pain
,
in
the
midst
of
such
immensity
.
  
<EOS>
Dolly
in
the
meanwhile
,
whose
gay
heart
and
head
ran
upon
other
matters
,
passed
out
at
the
garden
door
,
and
glancing
back
now
and
then
(
but
of
course
not
wondering
whether
Joe
saw
her
)
,
tripped
away
by
a
path
across
the
fields
with
which
she
was
well
acquainted
,
to
discharge
her
mission
at
the
Warren
;
and
this
deponent
hath
been
informed
and
verily
believes
,
that
you
might
have
seen
many
less
pleasant
objects
than
the
cherry
-
coloured
mantle
and
ribbons
,
as
they
went
fluttering
along
the
green
meadows
in
the
bright
light
of
the
day
,
like
giddy
things
as
they
were
.

Chapter
20
    
<EOS>
The
proud
consciousness
of
her
trust
,
and
the
great
importance
she
derived
from
it
,
might
have
advertised
it
to
all
the
house
if
she
had
had
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
its
inhabitants
;
but
as
Dolly
had
played
in
every
dull
room
and
passage
many
and
many
a
time
,
when
a
child
,
and
had
ever
since
been
the
humble
friend
of
Miss
Haredale
,
whose
foster
-
sister
<EOS>
she
was
,
she
was
as
free
of
the
building
as
the
young
lady
herself
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
using
no
greater
precaution
than
holding
her
breath
and
walking
on
tiptoe
as
she
passed
the
library
door
,
she
went
straight
to
Emma
's
room
as
a
privileged
visitor
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
liveliest
room
in
the
building
.
 
<EOS>
The
chamber
was
sombre
like
the
rest
for
the
matter
of
that
,
but
the
presence
of
youth
and
beauty
would
make
a
prison
cheerful
(
saving
alas
!
<EOS>
that
confinement
withers
them
)
,
and
lend
some
charms
of
their
own
to
the
gloomiest
scene
.
 
<EOS>
Birds
,
flowers
,
books
,
drawing
,
music
,
and
a
hundred
such
graceful
tokens
of
feminine
loves
and
cares
,
filled
it
with
more
of
life
and
human
sympathy
than
the
whole
house
besides
seemed
made
to
hold
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
heart
in
the
room
;
and
who
that
has
a
heart
,
ever
fails
to
recognise
the
silent
presence
of
another
!
  
<EOS>
Dolly
had
one
undoubtedly
,
and
it
was
not
a
tough
one
either
,
though
there
was
a
little
mist
of
coquettishness
about
it
,
such
as
sometimes
surrounds
that
sun
of
life
in
its
morning
,
and
slightly
dims
its
lustre
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
when
Emma
rose
to
greet
her
,
and
kissing
her
affectionately
on
the
cheek
,
told
her
,
in
her
quiet
way
,
that
she
had
been
very
unhappy
,
the
tears
stood
in
Dolly
's
eyes
,
and
she
felt
more
sorry
than
she
could
tell
;
but
next
moment
she
happened
to
raise
them
to
the
glass
,
and
really
there
was
something
there
so
exceedingly
agreeable
,
that
as
she
sighed
,
she
smiled
,
and
felt
surprisingly
consoled
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
about
it
,
miss
,
"
said
Dolly
,
"
and
it
's
very
sad
indeed
,
but
when
things
are
at
the
worst
they
are
sure
to
mend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
are
you
sure
they
are
at
the
worst
?
"
asked
Emma
with
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
do
n't
see
how
they
can
very
well
be
more
unpromising
than
they
are
;
I
really
do
n't
,
"
said
Dolly
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
bring
something
to
begin
with
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
from
Edward
?
"
  
Dolly
nodded
and
smiled
,
and
feeling
in
her
pockets
(
there
were
pockets
in
those
days
)
with
an
affectation
of
not
being
able
to
find
what
she
wanted
,
which
greatly
enhanced
her
importance
,
at
length
produced
the
letter
.
 
<EOS>
As
Emma
hastily
broke
the
seal
and
became
absorbed
in
its
contents
,
Dolly
's
eyes
,
by
one
of
those
strange
accidents
for
which
there
is
no
accounting
,
wandered
to
the
glass
again
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
help
wondering
whether
the
coach
-
maker
suffered
very
much
,
and
quite
pitied
the
poor
man
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
long
letter
---
a
very
long
letter
,
written
close
on
all
four
sides
of
the
sheet
of
paper
,
and
crossed
afterwards
;
but
it
was
not
a
consolatory
letter
,
for
as
Emma
read
it
<EOS>
she
stopped
from
time
to
time
to
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
Dolly
marvelled
greatly
to
see
her
in
so
much
distress
,
for
to
her
thinking
a
love
affair
ought
to
be
one
of
the
best
jokes
,
and
the
slyest
,
merriest
kind
of
thing
in
life
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
set
it
down
in
her
own
mind
that
all
this
came
from
Miss
Haredale
's
being
so
constant
,
and
that
if
she
would
only
take
on
with
some
other
young
gentleman
---
 
just
in
the
most
innocent
way
possible
,
to
keep
her
first
lover
up
to
the
mark
---
she
would
find
herself
inexpressibly
comforted
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
that
's
what
I
should
do
if
it
was
me
,
"
thought
Dolly
.
<EOS>
"
To
make
one
's
sweetheart
miserable
is
well
enough
and
quite
right
,
but
to
be
made
miserable
one
's
self
is
a
little
too
much
!
"
  
<EOS>
However
it
would
n't
do
to
say
so
,
and
therefore
she
sat
looking
on
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
She
needed
a
pretty
considerable
stretch
of
patience
,
for
when
the
long
letter
had
been
read
once
all
through
it
was
read
again
,
and
when
it
had
been
read
twice
all
through
it
was
read
again
.
 
<EOS>
During
this
tedious
process
,
Dolly
beguiled
the
time
in
the
most
improving
manner
that
occurred
to
her
,
by
curling
her
hair
on
her
fingers
,
with
the
aid
of
the
looking
-
glass
before
mentioned
,
and
giving
it
some
killing
twists
.
  
<EOS>
Everything
has
an
end
.
 
<EOS>
Even
young
ladies
in
love
can
not
read
their
letters
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
In
course
of
time
the
packet
was
folded
up
,
and
it
only
remained
to
write
the
answer
.
  
<EOS>
But
as
this
promised
to
be
a
work
of
time
likewise
,
Emma
said
she
would
put
it
off
until
after
dinner
,
and
that
Dolly
must
dine
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
As
Dolly
had
made
up
her
mind
to
do
so
beforehand
,
she
required
very
little
pressing
;
and
when
they
had
settled
this
point
,
they
went
to
walk
in
the
garden
.
  
<EOS>
They
strolled
up
and
down
the
terrace
walks
,
talking
incessantly
---
 
<EOS>
at
least
,
Dolly
never
left
off
once
---
and
making
that
quarter
of
the
sad
and
mournful
house
quite
gay
.
 
<EOS>
Not
that
they
talked
loudly
or
laughed
much
,
but
they
were
both
so
very
handsome
,
and
it
was
such
a
breezy
day
,
and
their
light
dresses
and
dark
curls
appeared
so
free
and
joyous
in
their
abandonment
,
and
Emma
was
so
fair
,
and
Dolly
so
rosy
,
and
Emma
so
delicately
shaped
,
and
Dolly
so
plump
,
and
<EOS>
---
in
short
,
there
are
no
flowers
for
any
garden
like
such
flowers
,
<EOS>
let
horticulturists
say
what
they
may
,
and
both
house
and
garden
seemed
to
know
it
,
and
to
brighten
up
sensibly
.
  
<EOS>
After
this
,
came
the
dinner
and
the
letter
writing
,
and
some
more
talking
,
in
the
course
of
which
Miss
Haredale
took
occasion
to
charge
upon
Dolly
certain
flirtish
and
inconstant
propensities
,
which
accusations
Dolly
seemed
to
think
very
complimentary
indeed
,
and
to
be
mightily
amused
with
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
her
quite
incorrigible
in
this
respect
,
Emma
suffered
her
to
depart
;
but
not
before
she
had
confided
to
her
that
important
and
never
-
sufficiently
-
to
-
be
-
taken
-
care
-
of
answer
,
and
endowed
her
moreover
with
a
pretty
little
bracelet
as
a
keepsake
.
 
<EOS>
Having
clasped
it
on
her
arm
,
and
again
advised
her
half
in
jest
and
half
in
earnest
to
amend
her
roguish
ways
,
for
she
knew
she
was
fond
of
Joe
at
heart
(
which
Dolly
stoutly
denied
,
with
a
great
many
haughty
protestations
that
she
hoped
she
could
do
better
than
that
indeed
!
<EOS>
and
so
forth
)
,
she
bade
her
farewell
;
and
after
calling
her
back
to
give
her
more
supplementary
messages
for
Edward
,
than
anybody
with
tenfold
the
gravity
of
Dolly
Varden
could
be
reasonably
expected
to
remember
,
at
length
dismissed
her
.
  
<EOS>
Dolly
bade
her
good
bye
,
and
tripping
lightly
down
the
stairs
<EOS>
arrived
at
the
dreaded
library
door
,
and
was
about
to
pass
it
again
on
tiptoe
,
when
it
opened
,
and
behold
!
<EOS>
there
stood
Mr
Haredale
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Dolly
had
from
her
childhood
associated
with
this
gentleman
the
idea
of
something
grim
and
ghostly
,
and
being
at
the
moment
conscience
-
stricken
besides
,
the
sight
of
him
threw
her
into
such
a
flurry
that
she
could
neither
acknowledge
his
presence
nor
run
away
,
so
she
gave
a
great
start
,
and
then
with
downcast
eyes
stood
still
and
trembled
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
here
,
girl
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
taking
her
by
the
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
speak
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
sir
,
I
'm
in
a
hurry
,
"
faltered
Dolly
,
"
and
---
you
have
frightened
me
by
coming
so
suddenly
upon
me
,
sir
---
<EOS>
I
would
rather
go
,
sir
,
if
you
'll
be
so
good
as
to
let
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Immediately
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
who
had
by
this
time
led
her
into
the
room
and
closed
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
go
directly
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
just
left
Emma
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
just
this
minute
.
<EOS>
---
Father
's
waiting
for
me
,
sir
,
if
you
'll
please
to
have
the
goodness
---
"
  
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
.
 
<EOS>
"
Answer
me
a
question
.
 
<EOS>
What
did
you
bring
here
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Bring
here
,
sir
?
"
faltered
Dolly
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
tell
me
the
truth
,
I
am
sure
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dolly
hesitated
for
a
little
while
,
and
somewhat
emboldened
by
his
manner
,
said
at
last
,
"
<EOS>
Well
then
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
From
Mr
Edward
Chester
,
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
And
you
are
the
bearer
of
the
answer
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dolly
hesitated
again
,
and
not
being
able
to
decide
upon
any
other
course
of
action
,
burst
into
tears
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
alarm
yourself
without
cause
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
are
you
so
foolish
?
 
<EOS>
Surely
you
can
answer
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
that
I
have
but
to
put
the
question
to
Emma
and
learn
the
truth
directly
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
the
answer
with
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Dolly
had
what
is
popularly
called
a
spirit
of
her
own
,
and
being
now
fairly
at
bay
,
made
the
best
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
she
rejoined
,
trembling
and
frightened
as
she
was
.
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
,
I
have
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
kill
me
if
you
please
,
sir
,
but
I
wo
n't
give
it
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
very
sorry
,
---
<EOS>
but
I
wo
n't
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
commend
your
firmness
and
your
plain
-
speaking
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
.
 
<EOS>
"
Rest
assured
that
I
have
as
little
desire
to
take
your
letter
as
your
life
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
a
very
discreet
messenger
and
a
good
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Not
feeling
quite
certain
,
as
she
afterwards
said
,
whether
he
might
not
be
"
coming
over
her
"
with
these
compliments
,
Dolly
kept
as
far
from
him
as
she
could
,
cried
again
,
and
resolved
to
defend
her
pocket
(
for
the
letter
was
there
)
to
the
last
extremity
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
some
design
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
after
a
short
silence
,
during
which
a
smile
,
as
he
regarded
her
,
had
struggled
through
the
gloom
and
melancholy
that
was
natural
to
his
face
,
"
of
providing
a
companion
for
my
niece
;
for
her
life
is
a
very
lonely
one
.
 
<EOS>
Would
you
like
the
office
?
 
<EOS>
You
are
the
oldest
friend
she
has
,
and
the
best
entitled
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
sir
,
"
answered
Dolly
,
not
sure
<EOS>
but
he
was
bantering
her
;
"
I
ca
n't
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
they
might
wish
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
n't
give
an
opinion
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
your
friends
had
no
objection
,
would
you
have
any
?
"
said
Mr
Haredale
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
a
plain
question
;
and
easy
to
answer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
at
all
that
I
know
of
sir
,
"
replied
Dolly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
very
glad
to
be
near
Miss
Emma
of
course
,
and
always
am
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
well
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
all
I
had
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
anxious
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
me
detain
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dolly
did
n't
let
him
,
nor
did
she
wait
for
him
to
try
,
for
the
words
<EOS>
had
no
sooner
passed
his
lips
than
she
was
out
of
the
room
,
out
of
the
house
,
and
in
the
fields
again
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
thing
to
be
done
,
of
course
,
when
she
came
to
herself
and
considered
what
a
flurry
she
had
been
in
,
was
to
cry
afresh
;
and
the
next
thing
,
when
she
reflected
how
well
she
had
got
over
it
,
was
to
laugh
heartily
.
 
<EOS>
The
tears
once
banished
gave
place
to
the
smiles
,
and
at
last
Dolly
laughed
so
much
that
she
was
fain
to
lean
against
a
tree
,
and
give
vent
to
her
exultation
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
could
laugh
no
longer
,
and
was
quite
tired
,
she
put
her
head
-
dress
to
rights
,
dried
her
eyes
,
looked
back
very
merrily
and
triumphantly
at
the
Warren
chimneys
,
which
were
just
visible
,
and
resumed
her
walk
.
  
<EOS>
The
twilight
had
come
on
,
and
it
was
quickly
growing
dusk
,
but
the
path
was
so
familiar
to
her
from
frequent
traversing
that
she
hardly
thought
of
this
,
and
certainly
felt
no
uneasiness
at
being
left
alone
.
 
<EOS>
Moreover
,
there
was
the
bracelet
to
admire
;
and
when
she
had
given
it
a
good
rub
,
and
held
it
out
at
arm
's
length
,
it
sparkled
and
glittered
so
beautifully
on
her
wrist
,
that
to
look
at
it
in
every
point
of
view
and
with
every
possible
turn
of
the
arm
,
was
quite
an
absorbing
business
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
the
letter
too
,
and
it
looked
so
mysterious
and
knowing
,
when
she
took
it
out
of
her
pocket
,
and
it
held
,
as
she
knew
,
so
much
inside
,
that
to
turn
it
over
and
over
,
and
think
about
it
,
and
wonder
how
it
began
,
and
how
it
ended
,
and
what
it
said
all
through
,
was
another
matter
of
constant
occupation
.
 
<EOS>
Between
the
bracelet
and
the
letter
,
there
was
quite
enough
to
do
without
thinking
of
anything
else
;
and
admiring
each
by
turns
,
Dolly
went
on
gaily
.
  
<EOS>
As
she
passed
through
a
wicket
-
gate
to
where
the
path
was
narrow
,
and
lay
between
two
hedges
garnished
here
and
there
with
trees
,
she
heard
a
rustling
close
at
hand
,
which
brought
her
to
a
sudden
stop
.
<EOS>
She
listened
.
 
<EOS>
All
was
very
quiet
,
and
she
went
on
again
---
not
absolutely
frightened
,
but
a
little
quicker
than
before
perhaps
,
and
possibly
not
quite
so
much
at
her
ease
,
for
a
check
of
that
kind
<EOS>
is
startling
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
no
sooner
moved
on
again
,
than
she
was
conscious
of
the
same
sound
,
which
was
like
that
of
a
person
tramping
stealthily
among
bushes
and
brushwood
.
 
<EOS>
Looking
towards
the
spot
whence
it
appeared
to
come
,
she
almost
fancied
she
could
make
out
a
crouching
figure
.
 
<EOS>
She
stopped
again
.
 
<EOS>
All
was
quiet
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
On
she
went
once
more
---
decidedly
faster
now
---
and
tried
to
sing
softly
to
herself
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
he
<EOS>
the
wind
.
  
<EOS>
But
how
came
the
wind
to
blow
only
when
she
walked
,
and
cease
when
she
stood
still
?
 
<EOS>
She
stopped
involuntarily
as
she
made
the
reflection
,
and
the
rustling
noise
stopped
likewise
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
really
frightened
now
,
and
was
yet
hesitating
what
to
do
,
when
the
bushes
crackled
and
snapped
,
and
a
man
came
plunging
through
them
,
close
before
her
.

Chapter
21
    
<EOS>
It
was
for
the
moment
an
inexpressible
relief
to
Dolly
,
to
recognise
in
the
person
who
forced
himself
into
the
path
so
abruptly
,
and
now
stood
directly
in
her
way
,
Hugh
of
the
Maypole
,
whose
name
she
uttered
in
a
tone
of
delighted
surprise
that
came
from
her
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
Was
it
you
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
"
how
glad
I
am
to
see
you
!
<EOS>
and
how
could
you
terrify
me
so
!
"
  
<EOS>
In
answer
to
which
,
he
said
nothing
at
all
,
but
stood
quite
still
,
looking
at
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
come
to
meet
me
?
"
asked
Dolly
.
  
<EOS>
Hugh
nodded
,
and
muttered
something
to
the
effect
that
he
had
been
waiting
for
her
,
and
had
expected
her
sooner
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
it
likely
they
would
send
,
"
said
Dolly
,
greatly
reassured
by
this
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nobody
sent
me
,
"
was
his
sullen
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
came
of
my
own
accord
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
rough
bearing
of
this
fellow
,
and
his
wild
,
uncouth
appearance
,
had
often
filled
the
girl
with
a
vague
apprehension
even
when
other
people
were
by
,
and
had
occasioned
her
to
shrink
from
him
involuntarily
.
 
<EOS>
The
having
him
for
an
unbidden
companion
in
so
solitary
a
place
,
with
the
darkness
fast
gathering
about
them
,
renewed
and
even
increased
the
alarm
she
had
felt
at
first
.
  
<EOS>
If
his
manner
had
been
merely
dogged
and
passively
fierce
,
as
usual
,
she
would
have
had
no
greater
dislike
to
his
company
than
she
always
felt
---
<EOS>
perhaps
,
indeed
,
would
have
been
rather
glad
to
have
had
him
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
was
something
of
coarse
bold
admiration
in
his
look
,
which
terrified
her
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
She
glanced
timidly
towards
him
,
uncertain
whether
to
go
forward
or
retreat
,
and
he
stood
gazing
at
her
like
a
handsome
satyr
;
and
so
they
remained
for
some
short
time
without
stirring
or
breaking
silence
.
<EOS>
At
length
Dolly
took
courage
,
shot
past
him
,
and
hurried
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
spend
so
much
breath
in
avoiding
me
?
"
said
Hugh
,
accommodating
his
pace
to
hers
,
and
keeping
close
at
her
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
get
back
as
quickly
as
I
can
,
and
you
walk
too
near
me
,
answered
Dolly
.
"
  
"
Too
near
!
"
<EOS>
said
Hugh
,
stooping
over
her
so
that
she
could
feel
his
breath
upon
her
forehead
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
too
near
?
 
<EOS>
You
're
always
proud
to
ME
,
mistress
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
proud
to
no
one
.
 
<EOS>
You
mistake
me
,
"
answered
Dolly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fall
back
,
if
you
please
,
or
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
mistress
,
"
he
rejoined
,
endeavouring
to
draw
her
arm
through
his
,
"
I
'll
walk
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
released
herself
and
clenching
her
little
hand
,
struck
him
with
right
good
will
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
,
Maypole
Hugh
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
,
and
passing
his
arm
about
her
waist
,
held
her
in
his
strong
grasp
as
easily
as
if
she
had
been
a
bird
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
ha
ha
!
 
<EOS>
Well
done
,
mistress
!
 
<EOS>
Strike
again
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
beat
my
face
,
and
tear
my
hair
,
and
pluck
my
beard
up
by
the
roots
,
and
welcome
,
for
the
sake
of
your
bright
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
Strike
again
,
mistress
.
<EOS>
Do
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
ha
ha
!
 
<EOS>
I
like
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
go
,
"
she
cried
,
endeavouring
with
both
her
hands
to
push
him
off
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
go
this
moment
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
as
good
be
kinder
to
me
,
Sweetlips
,
"
said
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
had
,
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
Come
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
now
.
 
<EOS>
Why
are
you
always
so
proud
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
quarrel
with
you
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
love
you
when
you
're
proud
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
ha
ha
!
 
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
hide
your
beauty
from
a
poor
fellow
;
that
's
a
comfort
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
gave
him
no
answer
,
but
as
he
had
not
yet
checked
her
progress
,
continued
to
press
forward
as
rapidly
as
she
could
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
between
the
hurry
she
had
made
,
her
terror
,
and
the
tightness
of
his
embrace
,
her
strength
failed
her
,
and
she
could
go
no
further
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hugh
,
"
cried
the
panting
girl
,
"
good
Hugh
;
if
you
will
leave
me
I
will
give
you
anything
---
everything
I
have
---
and
never
tell
one
word
of
this
to
any
living
creature
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
best
not
,
"
he
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
Harkye
,
little
dove
,
you
had
best
not
.
 
<EOS>
All
about
here
know
me
,
and
what
I
dare
do
if
I
have
a
mind
.
 
<EOS>
If
ever
you
are
going
to
tell
,
stop
when
the
words
are
on
your
lips
,
and
think
of
the
mischief
you
'll
bring
,
if
you
do
,
upon
some
innocent
heads
that
you
would
n't
wish
to
hurt
a
hair
of
.
<EOS>
Bring
trouble
on
me
,
and
I
'll
bring
trouble
and
something
more
on
them
in
return
.
 
<EOS>
I
care
no
more
for
them
than
for
so
many
dogs
;
not
so
much
---
why
should
I
?
 
<EOS>
I
'd
sooner
kill
a
man
than
a
dog
any
day
.
<EOS>
I
've
never
been
sorry
for
a
man
's
death
in
all
my
life
,
and
I
have
for
a
dog
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
something
so
thoroughly
savage
in
the
manner
of
these
expressions
,
and
the
looks
and
gestures
by
which
they
were
accompanied
,
that
her
great
fear
of
him
gave
her
new
strength
,
and
enabled
her
by
a
sudden
effort
to
extricate
herself
and
run
fleetly
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
Hugh
was
as
nimble
,
strong
,
and
swift
of
foot
,
as
any
man
in
broad
England
,
and
it
was
but
a
fruitless
expenditure
of
energy
,
for
he
had
her
in
his
encircling
arms
again
before
she
had
gone
a
hundred
yards
.
  
<EOS>
"
Softly
,
darling
---
gently
---
would
you
fly
from
rough
Hugh
<EOS>
,
that
loves
you
as
well
as
any
drawing
-
room
gallant
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
,
"
she
answered
,
struggling
to
free
herself
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
.
 
<EOS>
Help
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
fine
for
crying
out
,
"
said
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
ha
ha
!
 
<EOS>
A
fine
,
pretty
one
,
from
your
lips
.
 
<EOS>
I
pay
myself
!
 
<EOS>
Ha
ha
ha
!
"
  
"
Help
!
help
!
<EOS>
help
!
"
 
<EOS>
As
she
shrieked
with
the
utmost
violence
she
could
exert
,
a
shout
was
heard
in
answer
,
and
another
,
and
another
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
Heaven
!
"
cried
the
girl
in
an
ecstasy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Joe
,
dear
Joe
,
this
way
.
 
<EOS>
Help
!
"
  
<EOS>
Her
assailant
paused
,
and
stood
irresolute
for
a
moment
,
but
the
shouts
drawing
nearer
and
coming
quick
upon
them
,
forced
him
to
a
speedy
decision
.
 
<EOS>
He
released
her
,
whispered
with
a
menacing
look
,
"
Tell
HIM
:
and
see
what
follows
!
"
and
leaping
the
hedge
,
was
gone
in
an
instant
.
 
<EOS>
Dolly
darted
off
,
and
fairly
ran
into
Joe
Willet
's
open
arms
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
<EOS>
are
you
hurt
?
<EOS>
what
was
it
?
<EOS>
who
was
it
?
<EOS>
where
is
he
?
<EOS>
what
was
he
like
?
"
<EOS>
with
a
great
many
encouraging
expressions
and
assurances
of
safety
,
were
the
first
words
Joe
poured
forth
.
<EOS>
But
poor
little
Dolly
was
so
breathless
and
terrified
that
for
some
time
she
was
quite
unable
to
answer
him
,
and
hung
upon
his
shoulder
,
sobbing
and
crying
as
if
her
heart
would
break
.
  
<EOS>
Joe
had
not
the
smallest
objection
to
have
her
hanging
on
his
shoulder
;
<EOS>
no
,
not
the
least
,
though
it
crushed
the
cherry
-
coloured
ribbons
sadly
,
and
put
the
smart
little
hat
out
of
all
shape
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
could
n't
bear
to
see
her
cry
;
it
went
to
his
very
heart
.
 
<EOS>
He
tried
to
console
her
,
bent
over
her
,
whispered
to
her
---
some
say
kissed
her
,
but
that
's
a
fable
.
 
<EOS>
At
any
rate
he
said
all
the
kind
and
tender
things
he
could
think
of
and
Dolly
let
him
go
on
and
did
n't
interrupt
him
once
,
and
it
was
a
good
ten
minutes
before
she
was
able
to
raise
her
head
and
thank
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
was
it
that
frightened
you
?
"
said
Joe
.
  
<EOS>
A
man
whose
person
was
unknown
to
her
had
followed
her
,
she
answered
;
he
began
by
begging
,
and
went
on
to
threats
of
robbery
,
which
he
was
on
the
point
of
carrying
into
execution
,
and
would
have
executed
,
but
for
Joe
's
timely
aid
.
 
<EOS>
The
hesitation
and
confusion
with
which
she
said
this
,
Joe
attributed
to
the
fright
she
had
sustained
,
and
no
suspicion
of
the
truth
occurred
to
him
for
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stop
when
the
words
are
on
your
lips
.
"
 
<EOS>
A
hundred
times
that
night
,
and
very
often
afterwards
,
when
the
disclosure
was
rising
to
her
tongue
,
Dolly
thought
of
that
,
and
repressed
it
.
 
<EOS>
A
deeply
rooted
dread
of
the
man
<EOS>
;
the
conviction
that
his
ferocious
nature
,
once
roused
,
would
stop
at
nothing
;
and
the
strong
assurance
that
if
she
impeached
him
,
the
full
measure
of
his
wrath
and
vengeance
would
be
wreaked
on
Joe
,
who
had
preserved
her
;
these
were
considerations
she
had
not
the
courage
to
overcome
,
and
inducements
to
secrecy
too
powerful
for
her
to
surmount
.
  
<EOS>
Joe
,
for
his
part
,
was
a
great
deal
too
happy
to
inquire
very
curiously
into
the
matter
;
and
Dolly
being
yet
too
tremulous
to
walk
without
assistance
,
they
went
forward
very
slowly
,
and
in
his
mind
very
pleasantly
,
until
the
Maypole
lights
were
near
at
hand
,
twinkling
their
cheerful
welcome
,
when
Dolly
stopped
suddenly
and
with
a
half
scream
exclaimed
,
  
"
The
letter
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
letter
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Joe
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
I
was
carrying
---
I
had
it
in
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
My
bracelet
too
<EOS>
,
"
she
said
,
clasping
her
wrist
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
lost
them
both
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
just
now
?
"
said
Joe
.
  
<EOS>
"
Either
I
dropped
them
then
,
or
they
were
taken
from
me
,
"
answered
Dolly
,
vainly
searching
her
pocket
and
rustling
her
dress
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
are
gone
,
both
gone
.
 
<EOS>
What
an
unhappy
girl
I
am
!
"
 
<EOS>
With
these
words
poor
Dolly
,
who
to
do
her
justice
was
quite
as
sorry
for
the
loss
of
the
letter
as
for
her
bracelet
,
fell
a
-
crying
again
,
and
bemoaned
her
fate
most
movingly
.
  
<EOS>
Joe
tried
to
comfort
her
with
the
assurance
that
directly
he
had
housed
her
in
the
Maypole
,
he
would
return
to
the
spot
with
a
lantern
(
for
it
was
now
quite
dark
)
and
make
strict
search
for
the
missing
articles
,
which
there
was
great
probability
of
his
finding
,
as
it
was
not
likely
that
anybody
had
passed
that
way
since
,
and
she
was
not
conscious
that
they
had
been
forcibly
taken
from
her
.
<EOS>
Dolly
thanked
him
very
heartily
for
this
offer
,
though
with
no
great
hope
of
his
quest
being
successful
;
and
so
with
many
lamentations
on
her
side
,
and
many
hopeful
words
on
his
,
and
much
weakness
on
the
part
of
Dolly
and
much
tender
supporting
on
the
part
of
Joe
,
they
reached
the
Maypole
bar
at
last
,
where
the
locksmith
and
his
wife
and
old
John
were
yet
keeping
high
festival
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Willet
received
the
intelligence
of
Dolly
's
trouble
with
that
surprising
presence
of
mind
and
readiness
of
speech
for
which
he
was
so
eminently
distinguished
above
all
other
men
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
expressed
her
sympathy
for
her
daughter
's
distress
by
scolding
her
roundly
for
being
so
late
;
and
the
honest
locksmith
divided
himself
between
condoling
with
and
kissing
Dolly
,
and
shaking
hands
heartily
with
Joe
,
whom
he
could
not
sufficiently
praise
or
thank
.
  
<EOS>
In
reference
to
this
latter
point
,
old
John
was
far
from
agreeing
with
his
friend
;
for
besides
that
he
by
no
means
approved
of
an
adventurous
spirit
in
the
abstract
,
it
occurred
to
him
that
if
his
son
and
heir
had
been
seriously
damaged
in
a
scuffle
,
the
consequences
would
assuredly
have
been
expensive
and
inconvenient
,
and
might
perhaps
have
proved
detrimental
to
the
Maypole
business
.
<EOS>
Wherefore
,
and
because
he
looked
with
no
favourable
eye
upon
young
girls
,
but
rather
considered
that
they
and
the
whole
female
sex
were
a
kind
of
nonsensical
mistake
on
the
part
of
Nature
,
he
took
occasion
to
retire
and
shake
his
head
in
private
at
the
boiler
;
inspired
by
which
silent
oracle
,
he
was
moved
to
give
Joe
various
stealthy
nudges
with
his
elbow
,
as
a
parental
reproof
and
gentle
admonition
to
mind
his
own
business
and
not
make
a
fool
of
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Joe
,
however
,
took
down
the
lantern
and
lighted
it
;
and
arming
himself
with
a
stout
stick
,
asked
whether
Hugh
was
in
the
stable
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
lying
asleep
before
the
kitchen
fire
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Willet
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
him
for
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
him
to
come
with
me
to
look
after
this
bracelet
and
letter
,
"
answered
Joe
.
 
<EOS>
"
Halloa
there
!
 
<EOS>
Hugh
!
"
  
<EOS>
Dolly
turned
pale
as
death
,
and
felt
as
if
she
must
faint
forthwith
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
few
moments
,
Hugh
came
staggering
in
,
stretching
himself
and
yawning
according
to
custom
,
and
presenting
every
appearance
of
having
been
roused
from
a
sound
nap
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
,
sleepy
-
head
,
"
said
Joe
,
giving
him
the
lantern
.
 
<EOS>
"
Carry
this
,
and
bring
the
dog
,
and
that
small
cudgel
of
yours
.
 
<EOS>
And
woe
betide
the
fellow
if
we
come
upon
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
fellow
?
<EOS>
"
growled
Hugh
,
rubbing
his
eyes
and
shaking
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
fellow
?
<EOS>
"
returned
Joe
,
who
was
in
a
state
of
great
valour
and
bustle
;
"
a
fellow
you
ought
to
know
of
and
be
more
alive
about
.
<EOS>
It
's
well
for
the
like
of
you
,
lazy
giant
that
you
are
,
to
be
snoring
your
time
away
in
chimney
-
corners
,
when
honest
men
's
daughters
ca
n't
cross
even
our
quiet
meadows
at
nightfall
without
being
set
upon
by
footpads
,
and
frightened
out
of
their
precious
lives
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
They
never
rob
me
,
"
cried
Hugh
with
a
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
got
nothing
to
lose
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
'd
as
lief
knock
them
at
head
as
any
other
men
.
 
<EOS>
How
many
are
there
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Only
one
,
"
said
Dolly
faintly
,
for
everybody
looked
at
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
what
was
he
like
,
mistress
?
"
said
Hugh
with
a
glance
at
young
Willet
,
so
slight
and
momentary
that
the
scowl
it
conveyed
was
lost
on
all
but
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
About
my
height
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
---
not
so
tall
,
"
Dolly
replied
,
scarce
knowing
what
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
His
dress
,
"
said
Hugh
,
looking
at
her
keenly
,
"
like
---
like
any
of
ours
now
?
 
<EOS>
I
know
all
the
people
hereabouts
,
and
maybe
could
give
a
guess
at
the
man
,
if
I
had
anything
to
guide
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dolly
faltered
and
turned
paler
yet
;
then
answered
that
he
was
wrapped
in
a
loose
coat
and
had
his
face
hidden
by
a
handkerchief
and
that
she
could
give
no
other
description
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
n't
know
him
if
you
saw
him
then
,
belike
?
"
said
Hugh
with
a
malicious
grin
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
,
"
answered
Dolly
,
bursting
into
tears
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
wish
to
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
bear
to
think
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
talk
about
him
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
go
to
look
for
these
things
,
Mr
Joe
,
pray
do
n't
.
 
<EOS>
I
entreat
you
not
to
go
with
that
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
to
go
with
me
!
"
cried
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
too
rough
for
them
all
.
<EOS>
They
're
all
afraid
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
bless
you
mistress
<EOS>
,
I
've
the
tenderest
heart
alive
.
 
<EOS>
I
love
all
the
ladies
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Hugh
,
turning
to
the
locksmith
's
wife
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
opined
that
if
he
did
,
he
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
;
such
sentiments
being
more
consistent
(
so
she
argued
)
with
a
benighted
Mussulman
or
wild
Islander
than
with
a
stanch
Protestant
.
 
<EOS>
Arguing
from
this
imperfect
state
of
his
morals
,
Mrs
Varden
further
opined
that
he
had
never
studied
the
Manual
.
 
<EOS>
Hugh
admitting
that
he
never
had
,
and
moreover
that
he
could
n't
read
,
Mrs
Varden
declared
with
much
severity
,
that
he
ought
to
he
even
more
ashamed
of
himself
than
before
,
and
strongly
recommended
him
to
save
up
his
pocket
-
money
for
the
purchase
of
one
,
and
further
to
teach
himself
the
contents
with
all
convenient
diligence
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
still
pursuing
this
train
of
discourse
,
when
Hugh
,
somewhat
unceremoniously
and
irreverently
,
followed
his
young
master
out
,
and
left
her
to
edify
the
rest
of
the
company
.
 
<EOS>
This
she
proceeded
to
do
,
and
finding
that
Mr
Willet
's
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
with
an
appearance
of
deep
attention
,
gradually
addressed
the
whole
of
her
discourse
to
him
,
whom
she
entertained
with
a
moral
and
theological
lecture
of
considerable
length
,
in
the
conviction
that
great
workings
were
taking
place
in
his
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
The
simple
truth
was
,
however
,
that
Mr
Willet
,
although
his
eyes
were
wide
open
and
he
saw
a
woman
before
him
whose
head
by
long
and
steady
looking
at
seemed
to
grow
bigger
and
bigger
until
it
filled
the
whole
bar
,
was
to
all
other
intents
and
purposes
fast
asleep
;
and
so
sat
leaning
back
in
his
chair
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
until
his
son
's
return
caused
him
to
wake
up
with
a
deep
sigh
,
and
a
faint
impression
that
he
had
been
dreaming
about
pickled
pork
and
greens
---
 
a
vision
of
his
slumbers
which
was
no
doubt
referable
to
the
circumstance
of
Mrs
Varden
's
having
frequently
pronounced
the
word
"
Grace
"
with
much
emphasis
;
which
word
,
entering
the
portals
of
Mr
Willet
's
brain
as
they
stood
ajar
,
and
coupling
itself
with
the
words
"
before
meat
,
"
which
were
there
ranging
about
,
did
in
time
suggest
a
particular
kind
of
meat
together
with
that
description
of
vegetable
which
is
usually
its
companion
.
  
<EOS>
The
search
was
wholly
unsuccessful
.
 
<EOS>
Joe
had
groped
along
the
path
a
dozen
times
,
and
among
the
grass
,
and
in
the
dry
ditch
,
and
in
the
hedge
,
but
all
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
Dolly
,
who
was
quite
inconsolable
for
her
loss
,
wrote
a
note
to
Miss
Haredale
giving
her
the
same
account
of
it
that
she
had
given
at
the
Maypole
,
which
Joe
undertook
to
deliver
as
soon
as
the
family
were
stirring
next
day
.
 
<EOS>
That
done
,
they
sat
down
to
tea
in
the
bar
,
where
there
was
an
uncommon
display
of
buttered
toast
,
and
---
in
order
that
they
might
not
grow
faint
for
want
of
sustenance
,
and
might
have
a
decent
halting
-
place
or
halfway
house
between
dinner
and
supper
---
a
few
savoury
trifles
in
the
shape
of
great
rashers
of
broiled
ham
,
which
being
well
cured
,
done
to
a
turn
,
and
smoking
hot
,
sent
forth
a
tempting
and
delicious
fragrance
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
was
seldom
very
Protestant
at
meals
,
unless
it
happened
that
they
were
underdone
,
or
overdone
,
or
indeed
that
anything
occurred
to
put
her
out
of
humour
.
 
<EOS>
Her
spirits
rose
considerably
on
beholding
these
goodly
preparations
,
and
from
the
nothingness
of
good
works
,
she
passed
to
the
somethingness
of
ham
and
toast
with
great
cheerfulness
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
under
the
influence
of
these
wholesome
stimulants
,
she
sharply
reproved
her
daughter
for
being
low
and
despondent
(
which
she
considered
an
unacceptable
frame
of
mind
)
,
and
remarked
,
as
she
held
her
own
plate
for
a
fresh
supply
,
that
it
would
be
well
for
Dolly
,
who
pined
over
the
loss
of
a
toy
and
a
sheet
of
paper
,
if
she
would
reflect
upon
the
voluntary
sacrifices
of
the
missionaries
in
foreign
parts
who
lived
chiefly
on
salads
.
  
<EOS>
The
proceedings
of
such
a
day
occasion
various
fluctuations
in
the
human
thermometer
,
and
especially
in
instruments
so
sensitively
and
delicately
constructed
as
Mrs
Varden
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
at
dinner
Mrs
V
stood
at
summer
heat
;
genial
,
smiling
,
and
delightful
.
 
<EOS>
After
dinner
,
in
the
sunshine
of
the
wine
,
she
went
up
at
least
half
-
a
-
dozen
degrees
,
and
was
perfectly
enchanting
.
 
<EOS>
As
its
effect
subsided
,
she
fell
rapidly
,
went
to
sleep
for
an
hour
or
so
at
temperate
,
and
woke
at
something
below
freezing
.
 
<EOS>
Now
she
was
at
summer
heat
again
,
in
the
shade
;
and
when
tea
was
over
,
and
old
John
,
producing
a
bottle
of
cordial
from
one
of
the
oaken
cases
,
insisted
on
her
sipping
two
glasses
thereof
in
slow
succession
,
she
stood
steadily
at
ninety
for
one
hour
and
a
quarter
.
 
<EOS>
Profiting
by
experience
,
the
locksmith
took
advantage
of
this
genial
weather
to
smoke
his
pipe
in
the
porch
,
and
in
consequence
of
this
prudent
management
,
he
was
fully
prepared
,
when
the
glass
went
down
again
,
to
start
homewards
directly
.
  
<EOS>
The
horse
was
accordingly
put
in
,
and
the
chaise
brought
round
to
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Joe
,
who
would
on
no
account
be
dissuaded
from
escorting
them
until
they
had
passed
the
most
dreary
and
solitary
part
of
the
road
,
led
out
the
grey
mare
at
the
same
time
;
and
having
helped
Dolly
into
her
seat
(
more
happiness
!
)
<EOS>
sprung
gaily
into
the
saddle
.
<EOS>
Then
,
after
many
good
nights
,
and
admonitions
to
wrap
up
,
and
glancing
of
lights
,
and
handing
in
of
cloaks
and
shawls
,
the
chaise
rolled
away
,
and
Joe
trotted
beside
it
---
on
Dolly
's
side
,
no
doubt
,
and
pretty
close
to
the
wheel
too
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
22
    
<EOS>
It
was
a
fine
bright
night
,
and
for
all
her
lowness
of
spirits
<EOS>
Dolly
kept
looking
up
at
the
stars
in
a
manner
so
bewitching
<EOS>
(
and
SHE
knew
it
!
)
<EOS>
that
Joe
was
clean
out
of
his
senses
,
and
plainly
showed
that
if
ever
a
man
were
---
not
to
say
over
head
and
ears
,
but
over
the
Monument
and
the
top
of
Saint
Paul
's
in
love
,
that
man
was
himself
.
 
<EOS>
The
road
was
a
very
good
one
;
not
at
all
a
jolting
road
,
or
an
uneven
one
;
and
yet
Dolly
held
the
side
of
the
chaise
with
one
little
hand
,
all
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
If
there
had
been
an
executioner
behind
him
with
an
uplifted
axe
ready
to
chop
off
his
head
if
he
touched
that
hand
,
Joe
could
n't
have
helped
doing
it
.
 
<EOS>
From
putting
his
own
hand
upon
it
as
if
by
chance
,
and
taking
it
away
again
after
a
minute
or
so
,
he
got
to
riding
along
without
taking
it
off
at
all
;
as
if
he
,
the
escort
,
were
bound
to
do
that
as
an
important
part
of
his
duty
,
and
had
come
out
for
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
The
most
curious
circumstance
about
this
little
incident
was
,
that
Dolly
did
n't
seem
to
know
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
looked
so
innocent
and
unconscious
when
she
turned
her
eyes
on
Joe
,
that
it
was
quite
provoking
.
  
<EOS>
She
talked
though
;
talked
about
her
fright
,
and
about
Joe
's
coming
up
to
rescue
her
,
and
about
her
gratitude
,
and
about
her
fear
that
she
might
not
have
thanked
him
enough
,
and
about
their
always
being
friends
from
that
time
forth
---
and
about
all
that
sort
of
thing
.
<EOS>
And
when
Joe
said
,
not
friends
he
hoped
,
Dolly
was
quite
surprised
,
and
said
not
enemies
she
hoped
;
and
when
Joe
said
,
could
n't
they
be
something
much
better
than
either
,
Dolly
all
of
a
sudden
found
out
a
star
which
was
brighter
than
all
the
other
stars
,
and
begged
to
call
his
attention
to
the
same
,
and
was
ten
thousand
times
more
innocent
and
unconscious
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
manner
they
travelled
along
,
talking
very
little
above
a
whisper
,
and
wishing
the
road
could
be
stretched
out
to
some
dozen
times
its
natural
length
---
at
least
that
was
Joe
's
desire
---
<EOS>
when
,
as
they
were
getting
clear
of
the
forest
and
emerging
on
the
more
frequented
road
,
they
heard
behind
them
the
sound
of
a
horse
's
feet
at
a
round
trot
,
which
growing
rapidly
louder
as
it
drew
nearer
,
elicited
a
scream
from
Mrs
Varden
,
and
the
cry
"
a
friend
!
"
<EOS>
from
the
rider
,
who
now
came
panting
up
,
and
checked
his
horse
beside
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
man
again
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Dolly
,
shuddering
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hugh
!
"
said
Joe
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
errand
are
you
upon
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
come
to
ride
back
with
you
,
"
he
answered
,
glancing
covertly
at
the
locksmith
's
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
"
HE
sent
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
father
!
"
said
poor
Joe
;
adding
under
his
breath
,
with
a
very
unfilial
apostrophe
,
"
Will
he
never
think
me
man
enough
to
take
care
of
myself
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
!
"
returned
Hugh
to
the
first
part
of
the
inquiry
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
roads
are
not
safe
just
now
,
he
says
,
and
you
'd
better
have
a
companion
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ride
on
then
,
"
said
Joe
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
going
to
turn
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
complied
,
and
they
went
on
again
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
his
whim
or
humour
to
ride
immediately
before
the
chaise
,
and
from
this
position
he
constantly
turned
his
head
,
and
looked
back
.
 
<EOS>
Dolly
felt
that
he
looked
at
her
,
but
she
averted
her
eyes
and
feared
to
raise
them
once
,
so
great
was
the
dread
with
which
he
had
inspired
her
.
  
<EOS>
This
interruption
,
and
the
consequent
wakefulness
of
Mrs
Varden
,
who
had
been
nodding
in
her
sleep
up
to
this
point
,
except
for
a
minute
or
two
at
a
time
,
when
she
roused
herself
to
scold
the
locksmith
for
audaciously
taking
hold
of
her
to
prevent
her
nodding
herself
out
of
the
chaise
,
put
a
restraint
upon
the
whispered
conversation
,
and
made
it
difficult
of
resumption
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
before
they
had
gone
another
mile
,
Gabriel
stopped
at
his
wife
's
desire
,
and
that
good
lady
protested
she
would
not
hear
of
Joe
's
going
a
step
further
on
any
account
<EOS>
whatever
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
for
Joe
to
protest
on
the
other
hand
that
he
was
by
no
means
tired
,
and
would
turn
back
presently
,
and
would
see
them
safely
past
such
a
point
,
and
so
forth
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
was
obdurate
,
and
being
so
was
not
to
be
overcome
by
mortal
agency
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
night
---
if
I
must
say
it
,
"
said
Joe
,
sorrowfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
night
,
"
said
Dolly
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
have
added
,
"
Take
care
of
that
man
,
and
pray
do
n't
trust
him
,
"
but
he
had
turned
his
horse
's
head
,
and
was
standing
close
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
therefore
nothing
for
it
but
to
suffer
Joe
to
give
her
hand
a
gentle
squeeze
,
and
when
the
chaise
had
gone
on
for
some
distance
,
to
look
back
and
wave
it
,
as
he
still
lingered
on
the
spot
where
they
had
parted
,
with
the
tall
dark
figure
of
Hugh
beside
him
.
  
<EOS>
What
she
thought
about
,
going
home
;
and
whether
the
coach
-
maker
held
as
favourable
a
place
in
her
meditations
as
he
had
occupied
in
the
morning
,
is
unknown
.
 
<EOS>
They
reached
home
at
last
---
at
last
,
for
it
was
a
long
way
,
made
none
the
shorter
by
Mrs
Varden
's
grumbling
.
<EOS>
Miggs
hearing
the
sound
of
wheels
was
at
the
door
immediately
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
they
are
,
Simmun
!
 
<EOS>
Here
they
are
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Miggs
,
clapping
her
hands
,
and
issuing
forth
to
help
her
mistress
to
alight
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bring
a
chair
,
Simmun
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
an't
you
<EOS>
the
better
for
it
<EOS>
,
mim
?
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
feel
more
yourself
than
you
would
have
done
if
you
'd
have
stopped
at
home
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
gracious
!
<EOS>
how
cold
you
are
!
 
<EOS>
Goodness
me
,
sir
<EOS>
,
she
's
a
perfect
heap
of
ice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
help
it
,
my
good
girl
.
 
<EOS>
You
had
better
take
her
in
to
the
fire
,
"
said
the
locksmith
.
  
<EOS>
"
Master
sounds
unfeeling
,
mim
,
"
said
Miggs
,
in
a
tone
of
commiseration
,
"
but
such
is
not
his
intentions
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sure
.
 
<EOS>
After
what
he
has
seen
of
you
this
day
,
I
never
will
believe
but
that
he
has
a
deal
more
affection
in
his
heart
than
to
speak
unkind
.
 
<EOS>
Come
in
and
sit
yourself
down
by
the
fire
;
there
's
a
good
dear
---
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
complied
.
 
<EOS>
The
locksmith
followed
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
and
Mr
Tappertit
trundled
off
with
the
chaise
to
a
neighbouring
stable
.
  
<EOS>
"
Martha
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
locksmith
,
when
they
reached
the
parlour
,
"
if
you
'll
look
to
Dolly
yourself
or
let
somebody
else
do
it
,
perhaps
it
will
be
only
kind
and
reasonable
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
been
frightened
,
you
know
,
and
is
not
at
all
well
to
-
night
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
fact
,
Dolly
had
thrown
herself
upon
the
sofa
,
quite
regardless
of
all
the
little
finery
of
which
she
had
been
so
proud
in
the
morning
,
and
with
her
face
buried
in
her
hands
was
crying
very
much
.
  
<EOS>
At
first
sight
of
this
phenomenon
(
for
Dolly
was
by
no
means
accustomed
to
displays
of
this
sort
,
rather
learning
from
her
mother
's
example
to
avoid
them
as
much
as
possible
)
<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
expressed
her
belief
that
never
was
any
woman
so
beset
as
she
;
that
her
life
was
a
continued
scene
of
trial
;
that
whenever
she
was
disposed
to
be
well
and
cheerful
,
so
sure
were
the
people
around
her
to
throw
,
by
some
means
or
other
,
a
damp
upon
her
spirits
;
and
that
,
as
she
had
enjoyed
herself
that
day
,
and
Heaven
knew
it
was
very
seldom
she
did
enjoy
herself
<EOS>
so
she
was
now
to
pay
the
penalty
.
 
<EOS>
To
all
such
propositions
Miggs
assented
freely
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Dolly
,
however
,
grew
none
the
better
for
these
restoratives
,
but
rather
worse
,
indeed
;
and
seeing
that
she
was
really
ill
,
both
Mrs
Varden
and
Miggs
were
moved
to
compassion
,
and
tended
her
in
earnest
.
  
<EOS>
But
even
then
,
their
very
kindness
shaped
itself
into
their
usual
course
of
policy
,
and
though
Dolly
was
in
a
swoon
,
it
was
rendered
clear
to
the
meanest
capacity
,
that
Mrs
Varden
was
the
sufferer
.
<EOS>
Thus
when
Dolly
began
to
get
a
little
better
,
and
passed
into
that
stage
in
which
matrons
hold
that
remonstrance
and
argument
may
be
successfully
applied
,
her
mother
represented
to
her
,
with
tears
in
her
eyes
,
that
if
she
had
been
flurried
and
worried
that
day
,
she
must
remember
it
was
the
common
lot
of
humanity
,
and
in
especial
of
womankind
,
who
through
the
whole
of
their
existence
must
expect
no
less
,
and
were
bound
to
make
up
their
minds
to
meek
endurance
and
patient
resignation
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
entreated
her
to
remember
that
one
of
these
days
she
would
,
in
all
probability
,
have
to
do
violence
to
her
feelings
so
far
as
to
be
married
;
and
that
marriage
,
as
she
might
see
every
day
of
her
life
(
and
truly
she
did
)
was
a
state
requiring
great
fortitude
and
forbearance
.
 
<EOS>
She
represented
to
her
in
lively
colours
,
that
if
she
(
Mrs
V
)
had
not
,
in
steering
her
course
through
this
vale
of
tears
,
been
supported
by
a
strong
principle
of
duty
which
alone
upheld
and
prevented
her
from
drooping
,
she
must
have
been
in
her
grave
many
years
ago
;
in
which
case
she
desired
to
know
what
would
have
become
of
that
errant
spirit
(
meaning
the
locksmith
)
,
of
whose
eye
she
was
the
very
apple
,
and
in
whose
path
she
was
,
as
it
were
,
a
shining
light
and
guiding
star
?
  
<EOS>
Miss
Miggs
also
put
in
her
word
to
the
same
effect
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
that
indeed
and
indeed
Miss
Dolly
might
take
pattern
by
her
blessed
mother
,
who
,
she
always
had
said
,
and
always
would
say
,
though
she
were
to
be
hanged
,
drawn
,
and
quartered
for
it
next
minute
,
was
the
mildest
,
amiablest
,
forgivingest
-
spirited
,
longest
-
sufferingest
female
as
ever
she
could
have
believed
;
the
mere
narration
of
whose
excellencies
had
worked
such
a
wholesome
change
in
the
mind
of
her
own
sister
-
in
-
law
,
that
,
whereas
,
before
,
she
and
her
husband
lived
like
cat
and
dog
,
and
were
in
the
habit
of
exchanging
brass
candlesticks
,
pot
-
lids
,
flat
-
irons
,
and
other
such
strong
resentments
,
they
were
now
the
happiest
and
affectionatest
couple
upon
earth
;
as
could
be
proved
any
day
on
application
at
Golden
Lion
Court
,
number
twenty
-
sivin
,
second
bell
-

on
the
right
-
hand
doorpost
.
 
<EOS>
After
glancing
at
herself
as
a
comparatively
worthless
vessel
,
but
still
as
one
of
some
desert
,
she
besought
her
to
bear
in
mind
that
her
aforesaid
<EOS>
dear
and
only
mother
was
of
a
weakly
constitution
and
excitable
temperament
,
who
had
constantly
to
sustain
afflictions
in
domestic
life
,
compared
with
which
thieves
and
robbers
were
as
nothing
,
and
yet
never
sunk
down
or
gave
way
to
despair
or
wrath
,
but
,
in
prize
-
fighting
phraseology
,
always
came
up
to
time
with
a
cheerful
countenance
,
and
went
in
to
win
as
if
nothing
had
happened
.
 
<EOS>
When
Miggs
finished
her
solo
,
her
mistress
struck
in
again
,
and
the
two
together
performed
a
duet
to
the
same
purpose
;
the
burden
being
,
that
Mrs
Varden
was
persecuted
perfection
,
and
Mr
Varden
,
as
the
representative
of
mankind
in
that
apartment
,
a
creature
of
vicious
and
brutal
habits
,
utterly
insensible
to
the
blessings
he
enjoyed
.
 
<EOS>
Of
so
refined
a
character
,
indeed
,
was
their
talent
of
assault
under
the
mask
of
sympathy
,
that
when
Dolly
,
recovering
,
embraced
her
father
tenderly
,
as
in
vindication
of
his
goodness
,
Mrs
Varden
expressed
her
solemn
hope
that
this
would
be
a
lesson
to
him
for
the
remainder
of
his
life
,
and
that
he
would
do
some
little
justice
to
a
woman
's
nature
ever
afterwards
---
in
which
aspiration
Miss
Miggs
,
by
divers
sniffs
and
coughs
,
more
significant
than
the
longest
oration
,
expressed
her
entire
concurrence
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
great
joy
of
Miggs
's
heart
was
,
that
she
not
only
picked
up
a
full
account
of
what
had
happened
,
but
had
the
exquisite
delight
of
conveying
it
to
Mr
Tappertit
for
his
jealousy
and
torture
.
 
<EOS>
For
that
gentleman
,
on
account
of
Dolly
's
indisposition
,
had
been
requested
to
take
his
supper
in
the
workshop
,
and
it
was
conveyed
thither
by
Miss
Miggs
's
own
fair
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
Simmun
!
"
said
the
young
lady
,
"
such
goings
on
to
-
day
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
gracious
me
,
Simmun
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Tappertit
,
who
was
not
in
the
best
of
humours
,
and
who
disliked
Miss
Miggs
more
when
she
laid
her
hand
on
her
heart
and
panted
for
breath
than
at
any
other
time
,
as
her
deficiency
of
outline
was
most
apparent
under
such
circumstances
,
eyed
her
over
in
his
loftiest
style
,
and
deigned
to
express
no
curiosity
whatever
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
heard
the
like
,
nor
nobody
else
,
"
pursued
Miggs
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
idea
of
interfering
with
HER
.
 
<EOS>
What
people
can
see
in
her
to
make
it
worth
their
while
to
do
so
,
that
's
the
joke
---
<EOS>
he
he
he
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Finding
there
was
a
lady
in
the
case
,
Mr
Tappertit
haughtily
requested
his
fair
friend
to
be
more
explicit
,
and
demanded
to
know
what
she
meant
by
"
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
that
Dolly
,
"
said
Miggs
,
with
an
extremely
sharp
emphasis
on
the
name
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
,
oh
upon
my
word
and
honour
,
young
Joseph
Willet
is
a
brave
one
;
and
he
do
deserve
her
,
that
he
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Woman
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
,
jumping
off
the
counter
on
which
he
was
seated
;
"
beware
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
stars
,
Simmun
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Miggs
,
in
affected
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
frighten
me
to
death
!
 
<EOS>
What
's
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
are
strings
,
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
,
flourishing
his
bread
-
and
-
cheese
knife
in
the
air
,
"
in
the
human
heart
that
had
better
not
be
wibrated
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
what
's
the
matter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
very
well
---
if
you
're
in
a
huff
,
"
cried
Miggs
,
turning
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
Huff
or
no
huff
,
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
,
detaining
her
by
the
wrist
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
,
Jezebel
?
 
<EOS>
What
were
you
going
to
say
?
 
<EOS>
Answer
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
this
uncivil
exhortation
,
Miggs
gladly
did
as
she
was
required
;
and
told
him
how
that
their
young
mistress
,
being
alone
in
the
meadows
after
dark
,
had
been
attacked
by
three
or
four
tall
men
,
who
would
have
certainly
borne
her
away
and
perhaps
murdered
her
,
but
for
the
timely
arrival
of
Joseph
Willet
,
who
with
his
own
single
hand
put
them
all
to
flight
,
and
rescued
her
;
to
the
lasting
admiration
of
his
fellow
-
creatures
generally
,
and
to
the
eternal
love
and
gratitude
of
Dolly
Varden
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
,
fetching
a
long
breath
when
the
tale
was
told
,
and
rubbing
his
hair
up
till
it
stood
stiff
and
straight
on
end
all
over
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
His
days
are
numbered
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Simmun
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
"
said
the
'
prentice
,
"
his
days
are
numbered
.
 
<EOS>
Leave
me
.
 
<EOS>
Get
along
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miggs
departed
at
his
bidding
,
but
less
because
of
his
bidding
than
because
she
desired
to
chuckle
in
secret
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
had
given
vent
to
her
satisfaction
,
she
returned
to
the
parlour
;
where
the
locksmith
,
stimulated
by
quietness
and
Toby
,
had
become
talkative
,
and
was
disposed
to
take
a
cheerful
review
of
the
occurrences
of
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mrs
Varden
,
whose
practical
religion
(
as
is
not
uncommon
)
was
usually
of
the
retrospective
order
,
cut
him
short
by
declaiming
on
the
sinfulness
of
such
junketings
,
and
holding
that
it
was
high
time
to
go
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
To
bed
<EOS>
therefore
she
withdrew
,
with
an
aspect
as
grim
and
gloomy
as
that
of
the
Maypole
's
own
state
couch
;
and
to
bed
the
rest
of
the
establishment
soon
afterwards
repaired
.

Chapter
23
    
<EOS>
Twilight
had
given
place
to
night
some
hours
,
and
it
was
high
noon
in
those
quarters
of
the
town
in
which
"
the
world
"
condescended
to
dwell
---
the
world
being
then
,
as
now
,
of
very
limited
dimensions
and
easily
lodged
---
when
Mr
Chester
reclined
upon
a
sofa
in
his
dressing
-
room
in
the
Temple
,
entertaining
himself
with
a
book
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
dressing
,
as
it
seemed
,
by
easy
stages
,
and
having
performed
half
the
journey
was
taking
a
long
rest
.
 
<EOS>
Completely
attired
as
to
his
legs
and
feet
in
the
trimmest
fashion
of
the
day
,
he
had
yet
the
remainder
of
his
toilet
to
perform
.
 
<EOS>
The
coat
was
stretched
,
like
a
refined
scarecrow
,
on
its
separate
horse
;
the
waistcoat
was
displayed
to
the
best
advantage
;
the
various
ornamental
articles
of
dress
were
severally
set
out
in
most
alluring
order
;
and
yet
he
lay
dangling
his
legs
between
the
sofa
and
the
ground
,
as
intent
upon
his
book
as
if
there
were
nothing
but
bed
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
honour
,
"
he
said
,
at
length
raising
his
eyes
to
the
ceiling
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
was
reflecting
seriously
on
what
he
had
read
;
"
upon
my
honour
,
the
most
masterly
composition
,
the
most
delicate
thoughts
,
the
finest
code
of
morality
,
and
the
most
gentlemanly
sentiments
in
the
universe
!
 
<EOS>
Ah
Ned
,
Ned
,
if
you
would
but
form
your
mind
by
such
precepts
,
we
should
have
but
one
common
feeling
on
every
subject
that
could
possibly
arise
between
us
!
"
  
<EOS>
This
apostrophe
was
addressed
,
like
the
rest
of
his
remarks
,
to
empty
air
:
for
Edward
was
not
present
,
and
the
father
was
quite
alone
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
Lord
Chesterfield
,
"
he
said
,
pressing
his
hand
tenderly
upon
the
book
as
he
laid
it
down
,
"
if
I
could
but
have
profited
by
your
genius
soon
enough
to
have
formed
my
son
on
the
model
you
have
left
to
all
wise
fathers
,
both
he
and
I
would
have
been
rich
men
.
<EOS>
Shakespeare
was
undoubtedly
very
fine
in
his
way
;
Milton
good
,
though
prosy
;
Lord
Bacon
deep
,
and
decidedly
knowing
;
but
the
writer
who
should
be
his
country
's
pride
,
is
my
Lord
Chesterfield
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
became
thoughtful
again
,
and
the
toothpick
was
in
requisition
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
I
was
tolerably
accomplished
as
a
man
of
the
world
,
"
he
continued
,
"
I
flattered
myself
that
I
was
pretty
well
versed
in
all
those
little
arts
and
graces
which
distinguish
men
of
the
world
from
boors
and
peasants
,
and
separate
their
character
from
those
intensely
vulgar
sentiments
which
are
called
the
national
character
.
 
<EOS>
Apart
from
any
natural
prepossession
in
my
own
favour
,
I
believed
I
was
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
in
every
page
of
this
enlightened
writer
,
I
find
some
captivating
hypocrisy
which
has
never
occurred
to
me
before
,
or
some
superlative
piece
of
selfishness
to
which
I
was
utterly
a
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
quite
blush
for
myself
before
this
stupendous
creature
,
if
remembering
his
precepts
,
one
might
blush
at
anything
.
 
<EOS>
An
amazing
man
!
<EOS>
a
nobleman
indeed
!
<EOS>
any
King
or
Queen
may
make
a
Lord
,
but
only
the
Devil
himself
---
and
the
Graces
---
can
make
a
Chesterfield
.
"
  
<EOS>
Men
who
are
thoroughly
false
and
hollow
,
seldom
try
to
hide
those
vices
from
themselves
;
and
yet
in
the
very
act
of
avowing
them
,
they
lay
claim
to
the
virtues
they
feign
most
to
despise
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
,
"
say
they
,
"
this
is
honesty
,
this
is
truth
.
 
<EOS>
All
mankind
are
like
us
,
but
they
have
not
the
candour
to
avow
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
more
they
affect
to
deny
the
existence
of
any
sincerity
in
the
world
,
the
more
they
would
be
thought
to
possess
it
in
its
boldest
shape
;
and
this
is
an
unconscious
compliment
to
Truth
on
the
part
of
these
philosophers
,
which
will
turn
the
laugh
against
them
to
the
Day
of
Judgment
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Chester
,
having
extolled
his
favourite
author
,
as
above
recited
,
took
up
the
book
again
in
the
excess
of
his
admiration
and
was
composing
himself
for
a
further
perusal
of
its
sublime
morality
,
when
he
was
disturbed
by
a
noise
at
the
outer
door
;
occasioned
as
it
seemed
by
the
endeavours
of
his
servant
to
obstruct
the
entrance
of
some
unwelcome
visitor
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
late
hour
for
an
importunate
creditor
,
"
he
said
,
raising
his
eyebrows
with
as
indolent
an
expression
of
wonder
as
if
the
noise
were
in
the
street
,
and
one
with
which
he
had
not
the
smallest
possible
concern
.
 
<EOS>
"
Much
after
their
accustomed
time
.
 
<EOS>
The
usual
pretence
I
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
No
doubt
a
heavy
payment
to
make
up
tomorrow
.
<EOS>
Poor
fellow
,
he
loses
time
,
and
time
is
money
as
the
good
proverb
says
---
I
never
found
it
out
though
.
 
<EOS>
Well
.
 
<EOS>
What
now
?
 
<EOS>
You
know
I
am
not
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
man
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
servant
,
who
was
to
the
full
as
cool
and
negligent
in
his
way
as
his
master
,
"
has
brought
home
the
riding
-
whip
you
lost
the
other
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
you
were
out
,
but
he
said
he
was
to
wait
while
I
brought
it
in
,
and
would
n't
go
till
I
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
was
quite
right
,
"
returned
his
master
,
"
and
you
're
a
blockhead
,
possessing
no
judgment
or
discretion
whatever
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
him
to
come
in
,
and
see
that
he
rubs
his
shoes
for
exactly
five
minutes
first
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
man
laid
the
whip
on
a
chair
,
and
withdrew
.
 
<EOS>
The
master
,
who
had
only
heard
his
foot
upon
the
ground
and
had
not
taken
the
trouble
to
turn
round
and
look
at
him
,
shut
his
book
,
and
pursued
the
train
of
ideas
his
entrance
had
disturbed
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
time
were
money
,
"
he
said
,
handling
his
snuff
-
box
,
"
I
would
compound
with
my
creditors
,
and
give
them
---
let
me
see
---
how
much
a
day
?
 
<EOS>
There
's
my
nap
after
dinner
---
an
hour
<EOS>
---
they
're
extremely
welcome
to
that
,
and
to
make
the
most
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
morning
,
between
my
breakfast
and
the
paper
,
I
could
spare
them
another
hour
;
in
the
evening
before
dinner
say
another
.
 
<EOS>
Three
hours
a
day
.
<EOS>
They
might
pay
themselves
in
calls
,
with
interest
,
in
twelve
months
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
shall
propose
it
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
my
centaur
,
are
you
there
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Here
I
am
,
"
replied
Hugh
,
striding
in
,
followed
by
a
dog
,
as
rough
and
sullen
as
himself
;
"
and
trouble
enough
I
've
had
to
get
here
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
ask
me
to
come
for
,
and
keep
me
out
when
I
DO
come
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
good
fellow
,
"
returned
the
other
,
raising
his
head
a
little
from
the
cushion
and
carelessly
surveying
him
from
top
to
toe
,
"
I
am
delighted
to
see
you
,
and
to
have
,
in
your
being
here
,
the
very
best
proof
that
you
are
not
kept
out
.
 
<EOS>
How
are
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
well
enough
,
"
said
Hugh
impatiently
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
look
a
perfect
marvel
of
health
.
 
<EOS>
Sit
down
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'd
rather
stand
,
"
said
Hugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
Please
yourself
my
good
fellow
<EOS>
,
"
returned
Mr
Chester
rising
,
slowly
pulling
off
the
loose
robe
he
wore
,
and
sitting
down
before
the
dressing
-
glass
.
 
<EOS>
"
Please
yourself
by
all
means
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Having
said
this
in
the
politest
and
blandest
tone
possible
,
he
went
on
dressing
,
and
took
no
further
notice
of
his
guest
,
who
stood
in
the
same
spot
as
uncertain
what
to
do
next
,
eyeing
him
sulkily
from
time
to
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
to
speak
to
me
,
master
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
after
a
long
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
worthy
creature
,
"
returned
Mr
Chester
,
"
you
are
a
little
ruffled
and
out
of
humour
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
wait
till
you
're
quite
yourself
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
in
no
hurry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
behaviour
had
its
intended
effect
.
 
<EOS>
It
humbled
and
abashed
the
man
,
and
made
him
still
more
irresolute
and
uncertain
.
 
<EOS>
Hard
words
he
could
have
returned
,
violence
he
would
have
repaid
with
interest
;
but
this
cool
,
complacent
,
contemptuous
,
self
-
possessed
reception
,
caused
him
to
feel
his
inferiority
more
completely
than
the
most
elaborate
arguments
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
contributed
to
this
effect
.
 
<EOS>
His
own
rough
speech
,
contrasted
with
the
soft
persuasive
accents
of
the
other
;
his
rude
bearing
,
and
Mr
Chester
's
polished
manner
;
the
disorder
and
negligence
of
his
ragged
dress
,
and
the
elegant
attire
he
saw
before
him
;
with
all
the
unaccustomed
luxuries
and
comforts
of
the
room
,
and
the
silence
that
gave
him
leisure
to
observe
these
things
,
and
feel
how
ill
at
ease
they
made
him
;
all
these
influences
,
which
have
too
often
some
effect
on
tutored
minds
and
become
of
almost
resistless
power
when
brought
to
bear
on
such
a
mind
as
his
,
quelled
Hugh
completely
.
 
<EOS>
He
moved
by
little
and
little
nearer
to
Mr
Chester
's
chair
,
and
glancing
over
his
shoulder
at
the
reflection
of
his
face
in
the
glass
,
as
if
seeking
for
some
encouragement
in
its
expression
,
said
at
length
,
with
a
rough
attempt
at
conciliation
,
  
"
ARE
you
going
to
speak
to
me
,
master
,
or
am
I
to
go
away
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Speak
you
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
"
speak
you
,
good
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
spoken
,
have
I
not
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
waiting
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
look'ee
,
sir
,
"
returned
Hugh
with
increased
embarrassment
,
"
am
I
the
man
that
you
privately
left
your
whip
with
before
you
rode
away
from
the
Maypole
,
and
told
to
bring
it
back
whenever
he
might
want
to
see
you
on
a
certain
subject
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
doubt
the
same
,
or
you
have
a
twin
brother
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
glancing
at
the
reflection
of
his
anxious
face
;
"
which
is
not
probable
,
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
have
come
,
sir
,
"
said
Hugh
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
have
brought
it
back
,
and
something
else
along
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
A
letter
,
sir
,
it
is
,
that
I
took
from
the
person
who
had
charge
of
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
he
laid
upon
the
dressing
-
table
,
Dolly
's
lost
epistle
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
letter
that
had
cost
her
so
much
trouble
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
obtain
this
by
force
,
my
good
fellow
?
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
casting
his
eye
upon
it
without
the
least
perceptible
surprise
or
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
quite
,
"
said
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Partly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
was
the
messenger
from
whom
you
took
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
woman
.
 
<EOS>
One
Varden
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
indeed
!
"
said
Mr
Chester
gaily
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
else
did
you
take
from
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
else
?
"
  
"
Yes
,
"
said
the
other
,
in
a
drawling
manner
,
for
he
was
fixing
a
very
small
patch
of
sticking
plaster
on
a
very
small
pimple
near
the
corner
of
his
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
else
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
a
kiss
,
"
replied
Hugh
,
after
some
hesitation
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
what
else
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
in
the
same
easy
tone
,
and
smiling
twice
or
thrice
to
try
if
the
patch
adhered
---
"
<EOS>
I
think
there
was
something
else
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
heard
a
trifle
of
jewellery
spoken
of
---
a
mere
trifle
---
a
thing
of
such
little
value
,
indeed
,
that
you
may
have
forgotten
it
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
remember
anything
of
the
kind
---
such
as
a
bracelet
now
,
for
instance
?
"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
with
a
muttered
oath
thrust
his
hand
into
his
breast
,
and
drawing
the
bracelet
forth
,
wrapped
in
a
scrap
of
hay
,
was
about
to
lay
it
on
the
table
likewise
,
when
his
patron
stopped
his
hand
and
bade
him
put
it
up
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
took
that
for
yourself
my
excellent
friend
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
may
keep
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
neither
a
thief
nor
a
receiver
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
show
it
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
had
better
hide
it
again
,
and
lose
no
time
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
me
see
where
you
put
it
either
,
"
he
added
,
turning
away
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
not
a
receiver
!
"
said
Hugh
bluntly
,
despite
the
increasing
awe
in
which
he
held
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
call
THAT
,
master
?
"
striking
the
letter
with
his
heavy
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
call
that
quite
another
thing
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
coolly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
prove
it
presently
,
as
you
will
see
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
thirsty
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
Hugh
drew
his
sleeve
across
his
lips
,
and
gruffly
answered
yes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Step
to
that
closet
and
bring
me
a
bottle
you
will
see
there
,
and
a
glass
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
obeyed
.
 
<EOS>
His
patron
followed
him
with
his
eyes
,
and
when
his
back
was
turned
,
smiled
as
he
had
never
done
when
he
stood
beside
the
mirror
.
 
<EOS>
On
his
return
he
filled
the
glass
,
and
bade
him
drink
.
<EOS>
That
dram
despatched
,
he
poured
him
out
another
,
and
another
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
many
can
you
bear
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
filling
the
glass
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
many
as
you
like
to
give
me
.
 
<EOS>
Pour
on
.
 
<EOS>
Fill
high
.
 
<EOS>
A
bumper
with
a
bead
in
the
middle
!
 
<EOS>
Give
me
enough
of
this
,
"
he
added
,
as
he
tossed
it
down
his
hairy
throat
,
"
and
I
'll
do
murder
if
you
ask
me
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
I
do
n't
mean
to
ask
you
,
and
you
might
possibly
do
it
without
being
invited
if
you
went
on
much
further
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
with
great
composure
,
we
will
stop
,
if
agreeable
to
you
,
my
good
friend
,
at
the
next
glass
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
drinking
before
you
came
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
always
am
when
I
can
get
it
,
"
cried
Hugh
boisterously
,
waving
the
empty
glass
above
his
head
,
and
throwing
himself
into
a
rude
dancing
attitude
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
always
am
.
 
<EOS>
Why
not
?
 
<EOS>
Ha
ha
ha
!
 
<EOS>
What
's
so
good
to
me
as
this
?
 
<EOS>
What
ever
has
been
?
 
<EOS>
What
else
has
kept
away
the
cold
on
bitter
nights
,
and
driven
hunger
off
in
starving
times
?
<EOS>
What
else
has
given
me
the
strength
and
courage
of
a
man
,
when
men
would
have
left
me
to
die
,
a
puny
child
?
 
<EOS>
I
should
never
have
had
a
man
's
heart
but
for
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
died
in
a
ditch
.
 
<EOS>
Where
's
he
who
when
I
was
a
weak
and
sickly
wretch
,
with
trembling
legs
and
fading
sight
,
bade
me
cheer
up
,
as
this
did
?
 
<EOS>
I
never
knew
him
;
not
I.
 
<EOS>
I
drink
to
the
drink
,
master
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
ha
ha
!
"
  
"
You
are
an
exceedingly
cheerful
young
man
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
putting
on
his
cravat
with
great
deliberation
,
and
slightly
moving
his
head
from
side
to
side
to
settle
his
chin
in
its
proper
place
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Quite
a
boon
companion
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
you
see
this
hand
,
master
,
"
said
Hugh
,
"
and
this
arm
?
<EOS>
"
baring
the
brawny
limb
to
the
elbow
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
once
mere
skin
and
bone
,
and
would
have
been
dust
in
some
poor
churchyard
by
this
time
,
but
for
the
drink
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
cover
it
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
"
it
's
sufficiently
real
in
your
sleeve
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
never
have
been
spirited
up
to
take
a
kiss
from
the
proud
little
beauty
,
master
,
but
for
the
drink
,
"
cried
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
ha
ha
!
<EOS>
It
was
a
good
one
.
 
<EOS>
As
sweet
as
honeysuckle
,
I
warrant
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
thank
the
drink
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
drink
to
the
drink
again
,
master
.
<EOS>
Fill
me
one
more
.
 
<EOS>
Come
.
 
<EOS>
One
more
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
such
a
promising
fellow
,
"
said
his
patron
,
putting
on
his
waistcoat
with
great
nicety
,
and
taking
no
heed
of
this
request
,
"
that
I
must
caution
you
against
having
too
many
impulses
from
the
drink
,
and
getting
hung
before
your
time
.
 
<EOS>
What
's
your
age
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
"
you
are
young
enough
to
escape
what
I
may
call
a
natural
death
for
some
years
to
come
.
 
<EOS>
How
can
you
trust
yourself
in
my
hands
on
so
short
an
acquaintance
,
with
a
halter
round
your
neck
?
 
<EOS>
What
a
confiding
nature
yours
must
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
fell
back
a
pace
or
two
and
surveyed
him
with
a
look
of
mingled
terror
,
indignation
,
and
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
Regarding
himself
in
the
glass
with
the
same
complacency
as
before
,
and
speaking
as
smoothly
as
if
he
were
discussing
some
pleasant
chit
-
chat
of
the
town
,
his
patron
went
on
:
  
"
Robbery
on
the
king
's
highway
,
my
young
friend
,
is
a
very
dangerous
and
ticklish
occupation
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
pleasant
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
while
it
lasts
;
but
like
many
other
pleasures
in
this
transitory
world
,
it
seldom
lasts
long
.
 
<EOS>
And
really
if
in
the
ingenuousness
of
youth
,
you
open
your
heart
so
readily
on
the
subject
<EOS>
,
I
am
afraid
your
career
will
be
an
extremely
short
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
's
this
?
"
said
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
talk
of
master
?
 
<EOS>
Who
was
it
set
me
on
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
?
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
wheeling
sharply
round
,
and
looking
full
at
him
for
the
first
time
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
hear
you
.
 
<EOS>
Who
was
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
faltered
,
and
muttered
something
which
was
not
audible
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
was
it
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
curious
to
know
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
with
surpassing
affability
.
 
<EOS>
"
Some
rustic
beauty
perhaps
?
 
<EOS>
But
be
cautious
,
my
good
friend
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
not
always
to
be
trusted
.
 
<EOS>
Do
take
my
advice
now
,
and
be
careful
of
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
these
words
he
turned
to
the
glass
again
,
and
went
on
with
his
toilet
.
  
<EOS>
Hugh
would
have
answered
him
that
he
,
the
questioner
himself
had
set
him
on
,
but
the
words
stuck
in
his
throat
.
 
<EOS>
The
consummate
art
with
which
his
patron
had
led
him
to
this
point
,
and
managed
the
whole
conversation
,
perfectly
baffled
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
doubt
that
if
he
had
made
the
retort
which
was
on
his
lips
when
Mr
Chester
turned
round
and
questioned
him
so
keenly
,
he
would
straightway
have
given
him
into
custody
and
had
him
dragged
before
a
justice
with
the
stolen
property
upon
him
;
in
which
case
it
was
as
certain
he
would
have
been
hung
as
it
was
that
he
had
been
born
.
 
<EOS>
The
ascendency
which
it
was
the
purpose
of
the
man
of
the
world
to
establish
over
this
savage
instrument
,
was
gained
from
that
time
.
<EOS>
Hugh
's
submission
was
complete
.
 
<EOS>
He
dreaded
him
beyond
description
;
and
felt
that
accident
and
artifice
had
spun
a
web
about
him
,
which
at
a
touch
from
such
a
master
-
hand
as
his
,
would
bind
him
to
the
gallows
.
  
<EOS>
With
these
thoughts
passing
through
his
mind
,
and
yet
wondering
at
the
very
same
time
how
he
who
came
there
rioting
in
the
confidence
of
this
man
(
as
he
thought
)
,
should
be
so
soon
<EOS>
and
so
thoroughly
subdued
,
Hugh
stood
cowering
before
him
,
regarding
him
uneasily
from
time
to
time
,
while
he
finished
dressing
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
done
so
,
he
took
up
the
letter
,
broke
the
seal
,
and
throwing
himself
back
in
his
chair
,
read
it
leisurely
through
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
neatly
worded
upon
my
life
!
 
<EOS>
Quite
a
woman
's
letter
,
full
of
what
people
call
tenderness
,
and
disinterestedness
,
and
heart
,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
!
"
  
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
he
twisted
it
up
,
and
glancing
lazily
round
at
Hugh
as
though
he
would
say
"
You
see
this
?
<EOS>
"
held
it
in
the
flame
of
the
candle
.
 
<EOS>
When
it
was
in
a
full
blaze
,
he
tossed
it
into
the
grate
,
and
there
it
smouldered
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
directed
to
my
son
,
"
he
said
,
turning
to
Hugh
,
"
and
you
did
quite
right
to
bring
it
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
opened
it
on
my
own
responsibility
,
and
you
see
what
I
have
done
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
Take
this
,
for
your
trouble
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
stepped
forward
to
receive
the
piece
of
money
he
held
out
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
put
it
in
his
hand
,
he
added
:
  
"
<EOS>
If
you
should
happen
to
find
anything
else
of
this
sort
,
or
to
pick
up
any
kind
of
information
you
may
think
I
would
like
to
have
,
bring
it
here
,
will
you
,
my
good
fellow
?
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
said
with
a
smile
which
implied
---
or
Hugh
thought
it
did
---
 
"
fail
to
do
so
at
your
peril
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
answered
that
he
would
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
do
n't
,
"
said
his
patron
,
with
an
air
of
the
very
kindest
patronage
,
"
do
n't
be
at
all
downcast
or
uneasy
respecting
that
little
rashness
we
have
been
speaking
of
.
 
<EOS>
Your
neck
is
as
safe
in
my
hands
,
my
good
fellow
,
as
though
a
baby
's
fingers
clasped
it
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
---
Take
another
glass
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
quieter
now
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
accepted
it
from
his
hand
,
and
looking
stealthily
at
his
smiling
face
,
drank
the
contents
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
---
ha
,
ha
!
---
do
n't
you
drink
to
the
drink
any
more
?
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
in
his
most
winning
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
you
,
sir
,
"
was
the
sullen
answer
,
with
something
approaching
to
a
bow
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
drink
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
you
.
 
<EOS>
By
the
bye
,
what
is
your
name
,
my
good
soul
?
 
<EOS>
You
are
called
Hugh
,
I
know
,
of
course
---
your
other
name
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
other
name
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
very
strange
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
Do
you
mean
that
you
never
knew
one
,
or
that
you
do
n't
choose
to
tell
it
?
 
<EOS>
Which
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'd
tell
it
if
I
could
,
"
said
Hugh
,
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
always
called
Hugh
;
nothing
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
knew
,
nor
saw
,
nor
thought
about
a
father
;
and
I
was
a
boy
of
six
<EOS>
---
that
's
not
very
old
---
when
they
hung
my
mother
up
at
Tyburn
for
a
couple
of
thousand
men
to
stare
at
.
 
<EOS>
They
might
have
let
her
live
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
poor
enough
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
very
sad
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
his
patron
,
with
a
condescending
smile
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
she
was
an
exceedingly
fine
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
that
dog
of
mine
?
"
said
Hugh
,
abruptly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Faithful
,
I
dare
say
?
<EOS>
"
rejoined
his
patron
,
looking
at
him
through
his
glass
;
"
and
immensely
clever
?
 
<EOS>
Virtuous
and
gifted
animals
,
whether
man
or
beast
,
always
are
so
very
hideous
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Such
a
dog
as
that
,
and
one
of
the
same
breed
,
was
the
only
living
thing
except
me
that
howled
that
day
,
"
said
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Out
of
the
two
thousand
odd
---
there
was
a
larger
crowd
for
its
being
a
woman
---
the
dog
and
I
alone
had
any
pity
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
'd
have
been
a
man
,
he
'd
have
been
glad
to
be
quit
of
her
,
for
she
had
been
forced
to
keep
him
lean
and
half
-
starved
;
but
being
a
dog
,
and
not
having
a
man
's
sense
,
he
was
sorry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
dull
of
the
brute
,
certainly
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
"
and
very
like
a
brute
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
made
no
rejoinder
,
but
whistling
to
his
dog
,
who
sprung
up
at
the
sound
and
came
jumping
and
sporting
about
him
,
bade
his
sympathising
friend
good
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
night
;
he
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
Remember
;
you
're
safe
with
me
---
quite
safe
.
 
<EOS>
So
long
as
you
deserve
it
,
my
good
fellow
,
as
I
hope
you
always
will
,
you
have
a
friend
in
me
,
on
whose
silence
you
may
rely
.
 
<EOS>
Now
do
be
careful
of
yourself
,
pray
do
,
and
consider
what
jeopardy
you
might
have
stood
in
.
 
<EOS>
Good
night
!
<EOS>
bless
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
truckled
before
the
hidden
meaning
of
these
words
as
much
as
such
a
being
could
,
and
crept
out
of
the
door
so
submissively
and
subserviently
---
with
an
air
,
in
short
,
so
different
from
that
with
which
he
had
entered
---
that
his
patron
on
being
left
alone
,
smiled
more
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
yet
,
"
he
said
,
as
he
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
,
"
I
do
not
like
their
having
hanged
his
mother
.
 
<EOS>
The
fellow
has
a
fine
eye
,
and
I
am
sure
she
was
handsome
.
 
<EOS>
But
very
probably
she
was
coarse
---
red
-
nosed
perhaps
,
and
had
clumsy
feet
.
 
<EOS>
Aye
,
it
was
all
for
the
best
,
no
doubt
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
this
comforting
reflection
,
he
put
on
his
coat
,
took
a
farewell
glance
at
the
glass
,
and
summoned
his
man
,
who
promptly
attended
,
followed
by
a
chair
and
its
two
bearers
.
  
<EOS>
"
Foh
!
"
said
Mr
Chester
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
very
atmosphere
that
centaur
has
breathed
,
seems
tainted
with
the
cart
and
ladder
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
Peak
.
<EOS>
Bring
some
scent
and
sprinkle
the
floor
;
and
take
away
the
chair
he
sat
upon
,
and
air
it
;
and
dash
a
little
of
that
mixture
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
stifled
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
man
obeyed
;
and
the
room
and
its
master
being
both
purified
,
nothing
remained
for
Mr
Chester
but
to
demand
his
hat
,
to
fold
it
jauntily
under
his
arm
,
to
take
his
seat
in
the
chair
and
be
carried
off
;
humming
a
fashionable
tune

Chapter
24
    
<EOS>
How
the
accomplished
gentleman
spent
the
evening
in
the
midst
of
a
dazzling
and
brilliant
circle
;
how
he
enchanted
all
those
with
whom
he
mingled
by
the
grace
of
his
deportment
,
the
politeness
of
his
manner
,
the
vivacity
of
his
conversation
,
and
the
sweetness
of
his
voice
;
how
it
was
observed
in
every
corner
,
that
Chester
was
a
man
of
that
happy
disposition
that
nothing
ruffled
him
,
that
he
was
one
on
whom
the
world
's
cares
and
errors
sat
lightly
as
his
dress
,
and
in
whose
smiling
face
a
calm
and
tranquil
mind
was
constantly
reflected
;
how
honest
men
,
who
by
instinct
knew
him
better
,
bowed
down
before
him
nevertheless
,
deferred
to
his
every
word
,
and
courted
his
favourable
notice
;
how
people
,
who
really
had
good
in
them
,
went
with
the
stream
,
and
fawned
and
flattered
,
and
approved
,
and
despised
themselves
while
they
did
so
,
and
yet
had
not
the
courage
to
resist
;
how
,
in
short
,
he
was
one
of
those
who
are
received
and
cherished
in
society
(
as
the
phrase
is
)
by
scores
who
individually
would
shrink
from
and
be
repelled
by
the
object
of
their
lavish
regard
;
are
things
of
course
,
which
will
suggest
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
Matter
<EOS>
so
commonplace
needs
but
a
passing
glance
,
and
there
an
end
.
  
<EOS>
The
despisers
of
mankind
---
apart
from
the
mere
fools
and
mimics
,
of
that
creed
---
are
of
two
sorts
.
 
<EOS>
They
who
believe
their
merit
neglected
and
unappreciated
,
make
up
one
class
;
they
who
receive
adulation
and
flattery
,
knowing
their
own
worthlessness
,
compose
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
Be
sure
that
the
coldest
-
hearted
misanthropes
are
ever
of
this
last
order
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Chester
sat
up
in
bed
next
morning
,
sipping
his
coffee
,
and
remembering
with
a
kind
of
contemptuous
satisfaction
how
he
had
shone
last
night
,
and
how
he
had
been
caressed
and
courted
,
when
his
servant
brought
in
a
very
small
scrap
of
dirty
paper
,
tightly
sealed
in
two
places
,
on
the
inside
whereof
was
inscribed
in
pretty
large
text
these
words
:
"
A
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Desiring
of
a
conference
.
<EOS>
Immediate

read
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
in
the
name
of
the
Gunpowder
Plot
did
you
pick
up
this
?
"
said
his
master
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
given
him
by
a
person
then
waiting
at
the
door
,
the
man
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
With
a
cloak
and
dagger
?
"
said
Mr
Chester
.
  
<EOS>
With
nothing
more
threatening
about
him
,
it
appeared
,
than
a
leather
apron
and
a
dirty
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
him
come
in
.
"
 
<EOS>
In
he
came
---
<EOS>
Mr
Tappertit
;
with
his
hair
still
on
end
,
and
a
great
lock
in
his
hand
,
which
he
put
down
on
the
floor
in
the
middle
of
the
chamber
as
if
he
were
about
to
go
through
some
performances
in
which
it
was
a
necessary
agent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
with
a
low
bow
,
"
I
thank
you
for
this
condescension
,
and
am
glad
to
see
you
.
 
<EOS>
Pardon
<EOS>
the
menial
office
in
which
I
am
engaged
,
sir
,
and
extend
your
sympathies
to
one
,
who
,
humble
as
his
appearance
is
,
has
inn'ard
workings
far
above
his
station
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Chester
held
the
bed
-
curtain
farther
back
,
and
looked
at
him
with
a
vague
impression
that
he
was
some
maniac
,
who
had
not
only
broken
open
the
door
of
his
place
of
confinement
,
but
had
brought
away
the
lock
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tappertit
bowed
again
,
and
displayed
his
legs
to
the
best
advantage
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
heard
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
,
laying
his
hand
upon
his
breast
,
"
of
G

Locksmith

hanger

executed

<EOS>
"
What
then

asked
Mr
Chester
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
his
'
prentice

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
THEN
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ahem
!
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
.
 
<EOS>
"
Would
you
permit
me
to
shut
the
door
,
sir
,
and
will
you
further
,
sir
,
give
me
your
honour
bright
,
that
what
passes
between
us
is
in
the
strictest
confidence
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Chester
laid
himself
calmly
down
in
bed
again
,
and
turning
a
perfectly
undisturbed
face
towards
the
strange
apparition
,
which
had
by
this
time
closed
the
door
,
begged
him
to
speak
out
,
and
to
be
as
rational
as
he
could
,
without
putting
himself
to
any
very
great
personal
inconvenience
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
first
place
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
,
producing
a
small
pocket
-
handkerchief
and
shaking
it
out
of
the
folds
,
"
as
I
have
not
a
card
about
me

(
for
the
envy
of

admit
of

cast

Mr

offering
it
with
a
graceful

,

answered
Mr

politely

turning
to
some

at
one

said
Mr

looking
very
hard
at

said
Mr

the

<EOS>
"
Perhaps

said
Mr

a
stronger
flavour
of
oil

I
usually
refresh
my

you

<EOS>
"
By

said
Mr

suiting
the

During
the
whole
of
this
dialogue
,
Mr
Chester
had
suffered
nothing
but
his
smile
of
unvarying
serenity
and
politeness
to
appear
upon
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
Sim
Tappertit
,
who
had
far
too
good
an
opinion
of
himself
to
suspect
that
anybody
could
be
playing
upon
him
,
thought
within
himself
that
this
was
something
like
the
respect
to
which
he
was
entitled
,
and
drew
a
comparison
from
this
courteous
demeanour
of
a
stranger
,
by
no
means
favourable
to
the
worthy
locksmith
.
  
<EOS>
"
From
what
passes
in
our
house
,
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
,
"
I
am
aware
,

your

I

said
Mr

Do

I
am

And
what
I
tell

our

go
backwards

forwards

to

fro

up

down

to
that
there
jolly
old
Maypole
,
lettering

carrying

you

n't
help

not

Mr
Tappertit
stopped
to
take
breath
after
this
,

then
started
fresh
again

"
Now

a

said
Sim

folding

<EOS>
"
Now
I
come
to
THE
point

<EOS>
Sir

there
is
a
villain
at
that
Maypole

a
monster
in
human
shape

a
vagabond
of
the
deepest
dye

that
unless
you
get
rid
of
and
have
kidnapped

carried
off
at
the
very
least
---
nothing
less
will
do
---
will
marry
your
son
to
that
young
woman
,
as
certainly
and
as
surely
as
if
he
was
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
himself

<EOS>
He
will

sir

for
the
hatred
and
malice
that
he
bears
to
you
;
let
alone
the
pleasure

doing
a
bad
action

him

him
worse

said
Mr
Tappertit
wildly

putting
his
hair
up
straighter

making
a
crunching
noise
with
his
teeth
;

possible

<EOS>

A

"
said
Mr
Tappertit
.
 
<EOS>
"
Miggs
says
so
too
.
 
<EOS>
Miggs
and
me
both
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
We
ca
n't
bear
the
plotting
and
undermining
that
takes
place
.
 
<EOS>
Our
souls
recoil
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
Barnaby
Rudge
and
Mrs
Rudge
are
in
it
likewise
;
but
the
villain
,
Joseph
Willet
,
is
the
ringleader
.
<EOS>
Their
plottings
and
schemes
are
known
to
me
and
Miggs
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
want
information
of
'em
,
apply
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
Put
Joseph
Willet
down
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Destroy
him
.
 
<EOS>
Crush
him
.
 
<EOS>
And
be
happy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
Mr
Tappertit
,
who
seemed
to
expect
no
reply
,
and
to
hold
it
as
a
necessary
consequence
of
his
eloquence
that
his
hearer
should
be
utterly
stunned
,
dumbfoundered
,
and
overwhelmed
,
folded
his
arms
so
that
the
palm
of
each
hand
rested
on
the
opposite
shoulder
,
and
disappeared
after
the
manner
of
those
mysterious
warners
of
whom
he
had
read
in
cheap
story
-
books
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
fellow
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
relaxing
his
face
when
he
was
fairly
gone
,
"
is
good
practice
.
 
<EOS>
I
HAVE
some
command
of
my
features
,
beyond
all
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
He
fully
confirms
what
I
suspected
,
though
;
and
blunt
tools
are
sometimes
found
of
use
,
where
sharper
instruments
would
fail
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
I
may
be
obliged
to
make
great
havoc
among
these
worthy
people
.
 
<EOS>
A
troublesome
necessity
!
 
<EOS>
I
quite
feel
for
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
he
fell
into
a
quiet
slumber
:
---
subsided
into
such
a
gentle
,
pleasant
sleep
,
that
it
was
quite
infantine
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
25
    
Leaving
the
favoured
,
and
well
-
received
,
and
flattered
of
the
world
;
him
of
the
world
most
worldly
,
who
never
compromised
himself
by
an
ungentlemanly
action
,
and
never
was
guilty
of
a
manly
one
;
to
lie
smilingly
asleep
---
for
even
sleep
,
working
but
<EOS>
little
change
in
his
dissembling
face
,
became
with
him
a
piece
of
cold
,
conventional
hypocrisy
---
we
follow
in
the
steps
of
two
slow
travellers
on
foot
,
making
towards
Chigwell
.
  
<EOS>
Barnaby
and
his
mother
.
 
<EOS>
Grip
in
their
company
,
of
course
.
  
<EOS>
The
widow
,
to
whom
each
painful
mile
seemed
longer
than
the
last
,
toiled
wearily
along
;
while
Barnaby
,
yielding
to
every
inconstant
impulse
,
fluttered
here
and
there
,
now
leaving
her
far
behind
,
now
lingering
far
behind
himself
,
now
darting
into
some
by
-
lane
or
path
and
leaving
her
to
pursue
her
way
alone
,
until
he
stealthily
emerged
again
and
came
upon
her
with
a
wild
shout
of
merriment
,
as
his
wayward
and
capricious
nature
prompted
.
 
<EOS>
Now
he
would
call
to
her
from
the
topmost
branch
of
some
high
tree
by
the
roadside
;
now
using
his
tall
staff
as
a
leaping
-
pole
,
come
flying
over
ditch
or
hedge
or
five
-
barred
gate
;
now
run
with
surprising
swiftness
for
a
mile
or
more
on
the
straight
road
,
and
halting
,
sport
upon
a
patch
of
grass
with
Grip
till
she
came
up
.
 
<EOS>
These
were
his
delights
;
and
when
his
patient
mother
heard
his
merry
voice
,
or
looked
into
his
flushed
and
healthy
face
,
she
would
not
have
abated
them
by
one
sad
word
or
murmur
,
though
each
had
been
to
her
a
source
of
suffering
in
the
same
degree
as
it
was
to
him
of
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
something
to
look
upon
enjoyment
,
so
that
it
be
free
and
wild
and
in
the
face
of
nature
,
though
it
is
but
the
enjoyment
of
an
idiot
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
something
to
know
that
Heaven
has
left
the
capacity
of
gladness
in
such
a
creature
's
breast
;
it
is
something
to
be
assured
that
,
however
lightly
men
may
crush
that
faculty
in
their
fellows
,
the
Great
Creator
of
mankind
imparts
it
even
to
his
despised
and
slighted
work
.
 
<EOS>
Who
would
not
rather
see
a
poor
idiot
happy
in
the
sunlight
,
than
a
wise
man
pining
in
a
darkened
jail
!
  
<EOS>
Ye
men
of
gloom
and
austerity
,
who
paint
the
face
of
Infinite
Benevolence
with
an
eternal
frown
;
read
in
the
Everlasting
Book
,
wide
open
to
your
view
,
the
lesson
it
would
teach
.
 
<EOS>
Its
pictures
are
not
in
black
and
sombre
hues
,
but
bright
and
glowing
tints
;
its
music
---
save
when
ye
drown
it
---
is
not
in
sighs
and
groans
,
but
songs
and
cheerful
sounds
.
 
<EOS>
Listen
to
the
million
voices
in
the
summer
air
,
and
find
one
dismal
as
your
own
.
 
<EOS>
Remember
,
if
ye
can
,
the
sense
of
hope
and
pleasure
which
every
glad
return
of
day
awakens
in
the
breast
of
all
your
kind
who
have
not
changed
their
nature
;
and
learn
some
wisdom
even
from
the
witless
,
when
their
hearts
are
lifted
up
they
know
not
why
,
by
all
the
mirth
and
happiness
it
brings
.
  
<EOS>
The
widow
's
breast
was
full
of
care
,
was
laden
heavily
with
secret
dread
and
sorrow
;
but
her
boy
's
gaiety
of
heart
gladdened
her
,
and
beguiled
the
long
journey
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
he
would
bid
her
lean
upon
his
arm
,
and
would
keep
beside
her
steadily
for
a
short
distance
;
but
it
was
more
his
nature
to
be
rambling
to
and
fro
,
and
she
better
liked
to
see
him
free
and
happy
,
even
than
to
have
him
near
her
,
because
she
loved
him
better
than
herself
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
quitted
the
place
to
which
they
were
travelling
,
directly
after
the
event
which
had
changed
her
whole
existence
;
and
for
two
-
and
-
twenty
years
had
never
had
courage
to
revisit
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
her
native
village
.
 
<EOS>
How
many
recollections
crowded
on
her
mind
when
it
appeared
in
sight
!
  
<EOS>
Two
-
and
-
twenty
years
.
 
<EOS>
Her
boy
's
whole
life
and
history
.
 
<EOS>
The
last
time
she
looked
back
upon
those
roofs
among
the
trees
,
she
carried
him
in
her
arms
,
an
infant
.
 
<EOS>
How
often
since
that
time
had
she
sat
beside
him
night
and
day
,
watching
for
the
dawn
of
mind
that
never
came
;
how
had
she
feared
,
and
doubted
,
and
yet
hoped
,
long
after
conviction
forced
itself
upon
her
!
 
<EOS>
The
little
stratagems
she
had
devised
to
try
him
<EOS>
,
the
little
tokens
he
had
given
in
his
childish
way
---
not
of
dulness
but
of
something
infinitely
worse
,
<EOS>
so
ghastly
and
unchildlike
in
its
cunning
---
came
back
as
vividly
as
if
but
yesterday
had
intervened
.
 
<EOS>
The
room
in
which
they
used
to
be
;
the
spot
in
which
his
cradle
stood
;
he
,
old
and
elfin
-
like
in
face
,
but
ever
dear
to
her
,
gazing
at
her
with
a
wild
and
vacant
eye
,
and
crooning
some
uncouth
song
as
she
sat
by
and
rocked
him
;
every
circumstance
of
his
infancy
came
thronging
back
,
and
the
most
trivial
,
perhaps
,
the
most
distinctly
.
  
<EOS>
His
older
childhood
,
too
;
the
strange
imaginings
he
had
;
his
terror
of
certain
senseless
things
---
familiar
objects
he
endowed
with
life
;
the
slow
and
gradual
breaking
out
of
that
one
horror
,
in
which
,
before
his
birth
,
his
darkened
intellect
began
;
how
,
in
the
midst
of
all
,
she
had
found
some
hope
and
comfort
in
his
being
unlike
another
child
,
and
had
gone
on
almost
believing
in
the
slow
development
of
his
mind
until
he
grew
a
man
,
and
then
his
childhood
was
complete
and
lasting
;
one
after
another
,
all
these
old
thoughts
sprung
up
within
her
,
strong
after
their
long
slumber
and
bitterer
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
She
took
his
arm
and
they
hurried
through
the
village
street
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
same
as
it
was
wo
nt
to
be
in
old
times
,
yet
different
too
,
and
wore
another
air
.
 
<EOS>
The
change
was
in
herself
,
not
it
;
but
she
never
thought
of
that
,
and
wondered
at
its
alteration
,
and
where
it
lay
,
and
what
it
was
.
  
<EOS>
The
people
all
knew
Barnaby
,
and
the
children
of
the
place
came
flocking
round
him
---
as
she
remembered
to
have
done
with
their
fathers
and
mothers
round
some
silly
beggarman
,
when
a
child
herself
.
 
<EOS>
None
of
them
knew
her
;
they
passed
each
well
-
remembered
house
,
and
yard
,
and
homestead
;
and
striking
into
the
fields
,
were
soon
alone
again
.
  
<EOS>
The
Warren
was
the
end
of
their
journey
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
was
walking
in
the
garden
,
and
seeing
them
as
they
passed
the
iron
gate
,
unlocked
it
,
and
bade
them
enter
that
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
At
length
you
have
mustered
heart
to
visit
the
old
place
,
"
he
said
to
the
widow
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
you
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
the
first
time
,
and
the
last
,
sir
,
"
she
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
first
for
many
years
,
but
not
the
last
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
very
last
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
regarding
her
with
some
surprise
,
"
that
having
made
this
effort
,
you
are
resolved
not
to
persevere
and
are
determined
to
relapse
?
 
<EOS>
This
is
unworthy
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
often
told
you
,
you
should
return
here
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
be
happier
here
than
elsewhere
,
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
Barnaby
,
it
's
quite
his
home
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
Grip
's
,
"
said
Barnaby
,
holding
the
basket
open
.
 
<EOS>
The
raven
hopped
gravely
out
,
and
perching
on
his
shoulder
and
addressing
himself
to
Mr
Haredale
,
cried
---
as
a
hint
,
perhaps
,
that
some
temperate
refreshment
would
be
acceptable
---
"
<EOS>
Polly
put
the
ket
-
tle
on
,
we
'll
all
have
tea
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hear
me
,
Mary
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
kindly
,
as
he
motioned
her
to
walk
with
him
towards
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
life
has
been
an
example
of
patience
and
fortitude
,
except
in
this
one
particular
which
has
often
given
me
great
pain
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
enough
to
know
that
you
were
cruelly
involved
in
the
calamity
which
deprived
me
of
an
only
brother
,
and
Emma
of
her
father
,
without
being
obliged
to
suppose
(
as
I
sometimes
am
)
that
you
associate
us
with
the
author
of
our
joint
misfortunes
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Associate
you
with
him
,
sir
!
<EOS>
"
she
cried
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
"
I
think
you
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
almost
believe
that
because
your
husband
was
bound
by
so
many
ties
to
our
relation
,
and
died
in
his
service
and
defence
,
you
have
come
in
some
sort
to
connect
us
with
his
murder
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
"
<EOS>
she
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
little
know
my
heart
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
You
little
know
the
truth
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
natural
you
should
do
so
;
it
is
very
probable
you
may
,
without
being
conscious
of
it
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
speaking
more
to
himself
than
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
are
a
fallen
house
.
 
<EOS>
Money
,
dispensed
with
the
most
lavish
hand
,
would
be
a
poor
recompense
for
sufferings
like
yours
;
and
thinly
scattered
by
hands
so
pinched
and
tied
as
ours
,
it
becomes
a
miserable
mockery
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
it
so
<EOS>
,
God
knows
,
"
he
added
,
hastily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
should
I
wonder
if
she
does
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
me
wrong
,
dear
sir
,
indeed
,
"
she
rejoined
with
great
earnestness
;
"
and
yet
when
you
come
to
hear
what
I
desire
your
leave
to
say
---
"
  
"
I
shall
find
my
doubts
confirmed
?
<EOS>
"
he
said
,
observing
that
she
faltered
and
became
confused
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
quickened
his
pace
for
a
few
steps
,
but
fell
back
again
to
her
side
,
and
said
:
  
"
<EOS>
And
have
you
come
all
this
way
at
last
,
solely
to
speak
to
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
answered
,
"
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
curse
,
"
he
muttered
,
"
upon
the
wretched
state
of
us
proud
beggars
,
from
whom
the
poor
and
rich
are
equally
at
a
distance
;
the
one
being
forced
to
treat
us
with
a
show
of
cold
respect
;
the
other
condescending
to
us
in
their
every
deed
and
word
,
and
keeping
more
aloof
,
the
nearer
they
approach
us
.
---
Why
,
if
it
were
pain
to
you
(
as
it
must
have
been
)
to
break
for
this
slight
purpose
the
chain
of
habit
forged
through
two
-
and
-
twenty
years
,
could
you
not
let
me
know
your
wish
,
and
beg
me
to
come
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
was
not
time
,
sir
,
"
she
rejoined
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
took
my
resolution
but
last
night
,
and
taking
it
,
felt
that
I
must
not
lose
a
day
---
a
day
!
<EOS>
an
hour
---
in
having
speech
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
had
by
this
time
reached
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
paused
for
a
moment
,
and
looked
at
her
as
if
surprised
by
the
energy
of
her
manner
.
 
<EOS>
Observing
,
however
,
that
she
took
no
heed
of
him
,
but
glanced
up
,
shuddering
,
at
the
old
walls
with
which
such
horrors
were
connected
in
her
mind
,
he
led
her
by
a
private
stair
into
his
library
,
where
Emma
was
seated
in
a
window
,
reading
.
  
<EOS>
The
young
lady
,
seeing
who
approached
,
hastily
rose
and
laid
aside
her
book
,
and
with
many
kind
words
,
and
not
without
tears
,
gave
her
a
warm
and
earnest
welcome
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
widow
shrunk
from
her
embrace
as
though
she
feared
her
,
and
sunk
down
trembling
on
a
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
return
to
this
place
after
so
long
an
absence
,
"
said
Emma
gently
.

cried

Miss
Haredale
stood
beside
her
chair
,
regarding
her
with
silent
pity
.
 
<EOS>
She
remained
for
a
little
time
quite
still
;
then
rose
and
turned
to
Mr
Haredale
,
who
had
sat
down
in
his
easy
chair
,
and
was
contemplating
her
with
fixed
attention
.
  
<EOS>
The
tale
connected
with
the
mansion
borne
in
mind
,
it
seemed
,
as
has
been
already
said
,
the
chosen
theatre
for
such
a
deed
as
it
had
known
.
 
<EOS>
The
room
in
which
this
group
were
now
assembled
---
hard
by
the
very
chamber
where
the
act
was
done
---
dull
,
dark
,
and
sombre
;
heavy
with
worm
-
eaten
books
;
deadened
and
shut
in
by
faded
hangings
,
muffling
every
sound
;
shadowed
mournfully
by
trees
whose
rustling
boughs
gave
ever
and
anon
a
spectral
knocking
at
the
glass
;
wore
,
beyond
all
others
in
the
house
,
a
ghostly
,
gloomy
air
.
<EOS>
Nor
were
the
group
assembled
there
,
unfitting
tenants
of
the
spot
.
<EOS>
The
widow
,
with
her
marked
and
startling
face
and
downcast
eyes
;
Mr
Haredale
stern
and
despondent
ever
;
his
niece
beside
him
,
like
,
yet
most
unlike
,
the
picture
of
her
father
,
which
gazed
reproachfully
down
upon
them
from
the
blackened
wall
;
Barnaby
,
with
his
vacant
look
and
restless
eye
;
were
all
in
keeping
with
the
place
,
and
actors
in
the
legend
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
the
very
raven
,
who
had
hopped
upon
the
table
and
with
the
air
of
some
old
necromancer
appeared
to
be
profoundly
studying
a
great
folio
volume
that
lay
open
on
a
desk
,
was
strictly
in
unison
with
the
rest
,
and
looked
like
the
embodied
spirit
of
evil
biding
his
time
of
mischief
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
scarcely
know
,
"
said
the
widow
,
breaking
silence
,
"
how
to
begin
.
<EOS>
You
will
think
my
mind
disordered
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
whole
tenor
of
your
quiet
and
reproachless
life
since
you
were
last
here
,
"
returned
Mr
Haredale
,
mildly
,
"
shall
bear
witness
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
Why
do
you
fear
to
awaken
such
a
suspicion
?
 
<EOS>
You
do
not
speak
to
strangers
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
not
to
claim
our
interest
or
consideration
for
the
first
time
.
 
<EOS>
Be
more
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
Take
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Any
advice
or
assistance
that
I
can
give
you
,
you
know
is
yours
of
right
,
and
freely
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
if
I
came
,
sir
,
"
she
rejoined
,
"
I
who
have
but
one
other
friend
on
earth
,
to
reject
your
aid
from
this
moment
,
and
to
say
that
henceforth
I
launch
myself
upon
the
world
,
alone
and
unassisted
,
to
sink
or
swim
as
Heaven
may
decree
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
have
,
if
you
came
to
me
for
such
a
purpose
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
calmly
,
"
some
reason
to
assign
for
conduct
so
extraordinary
,
which
---
if
one
may
entertain
the
possibility
of
anything
so
wild
and
strange
---
would
have
its
weight
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
,
sir
,
"
she
answered
,
"
is
the
misery
of
my
distress
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
give
no
reason
whatever
.
 
<EOS>
My
own
bare
word
is
all
that
I
can
offer
.
<EOS>
It
is
my
duty
,
my
imperative
and
bounden
duty
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
did
not
discharge
it
,
I
should
be
a
base
and
guilty
wretch
.
 
<EOS>
Having
said
that
,
my
lips
are
sealed
,
and
I
can
say
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
though
she
felt
relieved
at
having
said
so
much
,
and
had
nerved
herself
to
the
remainder
of
her
task
,
she
spoke
from
this
time
with
a
firmer
voice
and
heightened
courage
.
  
<EOS>
"
Heaven
is
my
witness
,
as
my
own
heart
is
---
and
yours
,
dear
young
lady
,
will
speak
for
me
,
I
know
---
that
I
have
lived
,
since
that
time
we
all
have
bitter
reason
to
remember
,
in
unchanging
devotion
,
and
gratitude
to
this
family
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
is
my
witness
that
go
where
I
may
,
I
shall
preserve
those
feelings
unimpaired
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
is
my
witness
,
too
,
that
they
alone
impel
me
to
the
course
I
must
take
,
and
from
which
nothing
now
shall
turn
me
,
as
I
hope
for
mercy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
These
are
strange
riddles
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
this
world
,
sir
,
"
she
replied
,
"
they
may
,
perhaps
,
never
be
explained
.
 
<EOS>
In
another
,
the
Truth
will
be
discovered
in
its
own
good
time
.
 
<EOS>
And
may
that
time
,
"
she
added
in
a
low
voice
,
"
be
far
distant
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
be
sure
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
"
that
I
understand
you
,
for
I
am
doubtful
of
my
own
senses
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
mean
that
you
are
resolved
voluntarily
to
deprive
yourself
of
those
means
of
support
you
have
received
from
us
so
long
---
that
you
are
determined
to
resign
the
annuity
we
settled
on
you
twenty
years
ago
---
to
leave
house
,
and
home
,
and
goods
,
and
begin
life
anew
---
and
this
,
for
some
secret
reason
or
monstrous
fancy
which
is
incapable
of
explanation
,
which
only
now
exists
,
and
has
been
dormant
all
this
time
?
 
<EOS>
In
the
name
of
God
,
under
what
delusion
are
you
labouring
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
I
am
deeply
thankful
,
"
she
made
answer
,
"
for
the
kindness
of
those
,
alive
and
dead
,
who
have
owned
this
house
;
and
as
I
would
not
have
its
roof
fall
down
and
crush
me
,
or
its
very
walls
drip
blood
,
my
name
being
spoken
in
their
hearing
;
I
never
will
again
subsist
upon
their
bounty
,
or
let
it
help
me
to
subsistence
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
not
know
,
"
she
added
,
suddenly
,
"
to
what
uses
it
may
be
applied
;
into
what
hands
it
may
pass
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
,
and
I
renounce
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Surely
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
"
its
uses
rest
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
did
.
 
<EOS>
They
rest
with
me
no
longer
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
---
it
IS
---
devoted
to
purposes
that
mock
the
dead
in
their
graves
.
 
<EOS>
It
never
can
prosper
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
bring
some
other
heavy
judgement
on
the
head
of
my
dear
son
,
whose
innocence
will
suffer
for
his
mother
's
guilt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
words
are
these
!
"
cried
Mr
Haredale
,
regarding
her
with
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
"
Among
what
associates
have
you
fallen
?
 
<EOS>
Into
what
guilt
have
you
ever
been
betrayed
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
guilty
,
and
yet
innocent
;
wrong
,
yet
right
;
good
in
intention
,
though
constrained
to
shield
and
aid
the
bad
.
 
<EOS>
Ask
me
no
more
questions
,
sir
;
but
believe
that
I
am
rather
to
be
pitied
than
condemned
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
leave
my
house
to
-
morrow
,
for
while
I
stay
there
,
it
is
haunted
.
 
<EOS>
My
future
dwelling
,
if
I
am
to
live
in
peace
,
must
be
a
secret
.
 
<EOS>
If
my
poor
boy
should
ever
stray
this
way
,
do
not
tempt
him
to
disclose
it
or
have
him
watched
when
he
returns
;
for
if
we
are
hunted
,
we
must
fly
again
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
this
load
is
off
my
mind
,
I
beseech
you
---
and
<EOS>
you
,
dear
Miss
Haredale
,
too
---
to
trust
me
if
you
can
,
and
think
of
me
kindly
as
you
have
been
used
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
die
and
can
not
tell
my
secret
even
then
(
for
that
may
come
to
pass
)
,
it
will
sit
the
lighter
on
my
breast
in
that
hour
for
this
day
's
work
;
and
on
that
day
,
and
every
day
until
it
comes
,
I
will
pray
for
and
thank
you
both
,
and
trouble
you
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
With
that
,
she
would
have
left
them
,
but
they
detained
her
,
and
with
many
soothing
words
and
kind
entreaties
,
besought
her
to
consider
what
she
did
,
and
above
all
to
repose
more
freely
upon
them
,
and
say
what
weighed
so
sorely
on
her
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
her
deaf
to
their
persuasions
,
Mr
Haredale
suggested
,
as
a
last
resource
,
that
she
should
confide
in
Emma
,
of
whom
,
as
a
young
person
and
one
of
her
own
sex
,
she
might
stand
in
less
dread
than
of
himself
.
<EOS>
From
this
proposal
,
however
,
she
recoiled
with
the
same
indescribable
repugnance
she
had
manifested
when
they
met
.
 
<EOS>
The
utmost
that
could
be
wrung
from
her
was
,
a
promise
that
she
would
receive
Mr
Haredale
at
her
own
house
next
evening
,
and
in
the
mean
time
reconsider
her
determination
and
their
dissuasions
---
though
any
change
on
her
part
,
as
she
told
them
,
was
quite
hopeless
.
 
<EOS>
This
condition
made
at
last
,
they
reluctantly
suffered
her
to
depart
,
since
she
would
neither
eat
nor
drink
within
the
house
;
and
she
,
and
Barnaby
,
and
Grip
,
accordingly
went
out
as
they
had
come
,
by
the
private
stair
and
garden
-
gate
;
seeing
and
being
seen
of
no
one
by
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
remarkable
in
the
raven
that
during
the
whole
interview
he
had
kept
his
eye
on
his
book
with
exactly
the
air
of
a
very
sly
human
rascal
,
who
,
under
the
mask
of
pretending
to
read
hard
,
was
listening
to
everything
.
 
<EOS>
He
still
appeared
to
have
the
conversation
very
strongly
in
his
mind
,
for
although
,
when
they
were
alone
again
,
he
issued
orders
for
the
instant
preparation
of
innumerable
kettles
for
purposes
of
tea
,
he
was
thoughtful
,
and
rather
seemed
to
do
so
from
an
abstract
sense
of
duty
,
than
with
any
regard
to
making
himself
agreeable
,
or
being
what
is
commonly
called
good
company
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
to
return
by
the
coach
.
 
<EOS>
As
there
was
an
interval
of
full
two
hours
before
it
started
,
and
they
needed
rest
and
some
refreshment
,
Barnaby
begged
hard
for
a
visit
to
the
Maypole
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
mother
,
who
had
no
wish
to
be
recognised
by
any
of
those
who
had
known
her
long
ago
,
and
who
feared
besides
that
Mr
Haredale
might
,
on
second
thoughts
,
despatch
some
messenger
to
that
place
of
entertainment
in
quest
of
her
,
proposed
to
wait
in
the
churchyard
instead
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
was
easy
for
Barnaby
to
buy
and
carry
thither
such
humble
viands
as
they
required
,
he
cheerfully
assented
,
and
in
the
churchyard
they
sat
down
to
take
their
frugal
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
Here
again
,
the
raven
was
in
a
highly
reflective
state
;
walking
up
and
down
when
he
had
dined
,
with
an
air
of
elderly
complacency
which
was
strongly
suggestive
of
his
having
his
hands
under
his
coat
-
tails
;
and
appearing
to
read
the
tombstones
with
a
very
critical
taste
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
after
a
long
inspection
of
an
epitaph
,
he
would
strop
his
beak
upon
the
grave
to
which
it
referred
,
and
cry
in
his
hoarse
tones
,
"
I
'm
a
devil
,
I
'm
a
devil
,
I
'm
a
devil
!
"
<EOS>
but
whether
he
addressed
his
observations
to
any
supposed
person
below
,
or
merely
threw
them
off
as
a
general
remark
,
is
matter
of
uncertainty
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
quiet
pretty
spot
,
but
<EOS>
a
sad
one
for
Barnaby
's
mother
;
for
Mr
Reuben
Haredale
lay
there
,
and
near
the
vault
in
which
his
ashes
rested
,
was
a
stone
to
the
memory
of
her
own
husband
,
with
a
brief
inscription
recording
<EOS>
how
and
when
he
had
lost
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
She
sat
here
,
thoughtful
and
apart
,
until
their
time
was
out
,
and
the
distant
horn
told
that
the
coach
was
coming
.
  
<EOS>
Barnaby
,
who
had
been
sleeping
on
the
grass
,
sprung
up
quickly
at
the
sound
;
and
Grip
,
who
appeared
to
understand
it
equally
well
,
walked
into
his
basket
straightway
,
entreating
society
in
general
(
as
though
he
intended
a
kind
of
satire
upon
them
in
connection
with
churchyards
)
never
to
say
die
on
any
terms
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
soon
on
the
coach
-
top
and
rolling
along
the
road
.
  
<EOS>
It
went
round
by
the
Maypole
,
and
stopped
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Joe
was
from
home
,
and
Hugh
came
sluggishly
out
to
hand
up
the
parcel
that
it
called
for
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
fear
of
old
John
coming
out
.
 
<EOS>
They
could
see
him
from
the
coach
-
roof
fast
asleep
in
his
cosy
bar
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
part
of
John
's
character
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
a
point
of
going
to
sleep
at
the
coach
's
time
.
 
<EOS>
He
despised
gadding
about
;
he
looked
upon
coaches
as
things
that
ought
to
be
indicted
;
as
disturbers
of
the
peace
of
mankind
;
as
restless
,
bustling
,
busy
,
horn
-
blowing
contrivances
,
quite
beneath
the
dignity
of
men
,
and
only
suited
to
giddy
girls
that
did
nothing
but
chatter
and
go
a
-
shopping
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
know
nothing
about
coaches
here
,
sir
,
"
John
would
say
,
if
any
unlucky
stranger
made
inquiry
touching
the
offensive
vehicles
;
"
we
do
n't
book
for
'em
;
we
'd
<EOS>
rather
not
<EOS>
;
they
're
more
trouble
than
they
're
worth
,
with
their
noise
and
rattle
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
like
to
wait
for
'em
you
can
;
but
we
do
n't
know
anything
about
'em
;
they
may
call
and
they
may
not
---
there
's
a
carrier
<EOS>
---
he
was
looked
upon
as
quite
good
enough
for
us
,
when
I
was
a
boy
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
dropped
her

as
Hugh
climbed
up
,
and
while
he
hung
behind

and
talked
to
Barnaby
in
whispers

But
neither
he
nor
any
other
person
spoke
to
her
,
or
noticed
her
,
or
had
any
curiosity
about
her
;

so
,
an
alien
,
she
visited
and
left
the
village
where
she
had
been
born
,
and
had
lived
a
merry
child
,
a
comely
girl
,
a
happy
wife
---
where
she
had
known
all
her
enjoyment
of
life
,
and
had
entered
on
its
hardest
sorrows

<EOS>
And
you
're
not
surprised
to
hear
this
,
Varden
?
"
said
Mr
Haredale
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
You
and
<EOS>
she
have
always
been
the
best
friends
,
and
you
should
understand
her
if
anybody
does
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ask
your
pardon
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
the
locksmith
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
say
I
understood
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
have
the
presumption
to
say
that
of
any
woman
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
not
so
easily
done
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
not
so
much
surprised
,
sir
,
as
you
expected
me
to
be
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
why
not
,
my
good
friend
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
,
sir
,
"
returned
the
locksmith
with
evident
reluctance
,
"
I
have
seen
in
connection
with
her
,
something
that
has
filled
me
with
distrust
and
uneasiness
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
made
bad
friends
,
how
,
or
when
,
I
do
n't
know
;
but
that
her
house
is
a
refuge
for
one
robber
and
cut
-
throat
<EOS>
at
least
,
I
am
certain
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
Now
it
's
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Varden
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
own
eyes
,
sir
,
are
my
witnesses
,
and
for
her
sake
I
would
be
willingly
half
-
blind
,
if
I
could
but
have
the
pleasure
of
mistrusting
'em
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
kept
the
secret
till
now
,
and
it
will
go
no
further
than
yourself
,
I
know
;
but
I
tell
you
that
with
my
own
eyes
---
broad
awake
---
I
saw
,
in
the
passage
of
her
house
one
evening
after
dark
,
the
highwayman
who
robbed
and
wounded
Mr
Edward
Chester
,
and
on
the
same
night
threatened
me
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
you
made
no
effort
to
detain
him
?
"
said
Mr
Haredale
quickly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
returned
the
locksmith
,
"
she
herself
prevented
me
---
held
me
,
with
all
her
strength
,
and
hung
about
me
until
he
had
got
clear
off
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
having
gone
so
far
,
he
related
circumstantially
all
that
had
passed
upon
the
night
in
question
.
  
<EOS>
This
dialogue
was
held
in
a
low
tone
in
the
locksmith
's
little
parlour
,
into
which
honest
Gabriel
had
shown
his
visitor
on
his
arrival
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
had
called
upon
him
to
entreat
his
company
to
the
widow
's
,
that
he
might
have
the
assistance
of
his
persuasion
and
influence
;
and
out
of
this
circumstance
the
conversation
had
arisen
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
forbore
,
"
said
Gabriel
,
"
from
repeating
one
word
of
this
to
anybody
,
as
it
could
do
her
no
good
and
might
do
her
great
harm
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
and
hoped
,
to
say
the
truth
,
that
she
would
come
to
me
,
and
talk
to
me
about
it
,
and
tell
me
how
it
was
;
but
though
I
have
purposely
put
myself
in
her
way
more
than
once
or
twice
,
she
has
never
touched
upon
the
subject
---
except
by
a
look
.
 
<EOS>
And
indeed
,
"
said
the
good
-
natured
locksmith
,
"
there
was
a
good
deal
in
the
look
,
more
than
could
have
been
put
into
a
great
many
words
.
 
<EOS>
It
said
among
other
matters
"
Do
n't
ask
me
anything
"
so
imploringly
,
that
I
did
n't
ask
her
anything
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
think
me
an
old
fool
,
I
know
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
's
any
relief
to
call
me
one
,
pray
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
greatly
disturbed
by
what
you
tell
me
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
after
a
silence
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
meaning
do
you
attach
to
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
locksmith
shook
his
head
,
and
looked
doubtfully
out
of
window
at
the
failing
light
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
can
not
have
married
again
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
without
our
knowledge
surely
,
sir
.
"
  
"
She
may
have
done
so
,
in
the
fear
that
it
would
lead
,
if
known
,
to
some
objection
or
estrangement
.
 
<EOS>
Suppose
she
married
incautiously
---
 
<EOS>
it
is
not
improbable
,
for
her
existence
has
been
a
lonely
and
monotonous
one
for
many
years
---
and
the
man
turned
out
a
ruffian
,
she
would
be
anxious
to
screen
him
,
and
yet
would
revolt
from
his
crimes
.
 
<EOS>
This
might
be
.
 
<EOS>
It
bears
strongly
on
the
whole
drift
of
her
discourse
yesterday
,
and
would
quite
explain
her
conduct
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
suppose
Barnaby
is
privy
to
these
circumstances
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
impossible
to
say
,
sir
,
"
returned
the
locksmith
,
shaking
his
head
again
:
"
and
next
to
impossible
to
find
out
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
If
what
you
suppose
is
really
the
case
,
I
tremble
for
the
lad
---
a
notable
person
,
sir
,
to
put
to
bad
uses
---
"
  
"
It
is
not
possible
,
Varden
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
in
a
still
lower
tone
of
voice
than
he
had
spoken
yet
,
"
that
we
have
been
blinded
and
deceived
by
this
woman
from
the
beginning
?
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
possible
that
this
connection
was
formed
in
her
husband
's
lifetime
,
and
led
to
his
and
my
brother
's
---
"
  
"
Good
God
,
sir
,
"
cried
Gabriel
,
interrupting
him
,
"
do
n't
entertain
such
dark
thoughts
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
Five
-
and
-
twenty
years
ago
,
where
was
there
a
girl
like
her
?
 
<EOS>
A
gay
,
handsome
,
laughing
,
bright
-
eyed
damsel
!
 
<EOS>
Think
what
she
was
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
It
makes
my
heart
ache
now
,
even
now
,
though
I
'm
an
old
man
,
with
a
woman
for
a
daughter
,
to
think
what
she
was
and
what
she
is
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
change
,
but
that
's
with
Time
;
Time
does
his
work
honestly
,
and
I
do
n't
mind
him
.
 
<EOS>
A
fig
for
Time
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Use
him
well
,
and
he
's
a
hearty
fellow
,
and
scorns
to
have
you
at
a
disadvantage
.
 
<EOS>
But
care
and
suffering
(
and
those
have
changed
her
)
are
devils
,
sir
---
<EOS>
secret
,
stealthy
,
undermining
devils
---
 
who
tread
down
the
brightest
flowers
in
Eden
,
and
do
more
havoc
in
a
month
than
Time
does
in
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
Picture
to
yourself
for
one
minute
<EOS>
what
Mary
was
before
they
went
to
work
with
her
fresh
heart
and
face
<EOS>
---
do
her
that
justice
---
and
say
whether
such
a
thing
is
possible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
good
fellow
,
Varden
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
"
and
are
quite
right
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
brooded
on
that
subject
<EOS>
so
long
,
that
every
breath
of
suspicion
carries
me
back
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
quite
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
n't
,
sir
,
"
cried
the
locksmith
with
brightened
eyes
,
and
sturdy
,
honest
voice
;
"
it
is
n't
because
I
courted
her
before
Rudge
,
and
failed
,
that
I
say
she
was
too
good
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
have
been
as
much
too
good
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
WAS
too
good
for
him
;
he
was
n't
free
and
frank
enough
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
reproach
his
memory
with
it
,
poor
fellow
;
I
only
want
to
put
her
before
you
as
she
really
was
.
 
<EOS>
For
myself
,
I
'll
keep
her
old
picture
in
my
mind
;
and
thinking
of
that
,
and
what
has
altered
her
,
I
'll
stand
her
friend
,
and
try
to
win
her
back
to
peace
.
 
<EOS>
And
damme
,
sir
,
"
cried
Gabriel
,
"
with
your
pardon
for
the
word
,
I
'd
do
the
same
if
she
had
married
fifty
highwaymen
in
a
twelvemonth
;
and
think
it
in
the
Protestant
Manual
too
,
though
Martha
said
it
was
n't
,
tooth
and
nail
,
till
doomsday
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
If
the
dark
little
parlour
had
been
filled
with
a
dense
fog
,
which
,
clearing
away
in
an
instant
,
left
it
all
radiance
and
brightness
,
it
could
not
have
been
more
suddenly
cheered
than
by
this
outbreak
on
the
part
of
the
hearty
locksmith
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
voice
nearly
as
full
and
round
as
his
own
,
Mr
Haredale
cried
"
Well
said
!
<EOS>
"
and
bade
him
come
away
without
more
parley
.
 
<EOS>
The
locksmith
complied
right
willingly
;
and
both
getting
into
a
hackney
coach
which
was
waiting
at
the
door
,
drove
off
straightway
.
  
<EOS>
They
alighted
at
the
street
corner
,
and
dismissing
their
conveyance
,
walked
to
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
To
their
first
knock
at
the
door
there
was
no
response
.
 
<EOS>
A
second
met
with
the
like
result
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
answer
to
the
third
,
which
was
of
a
more
vigorous
kind
,
the
parlour
window
-
sash
was
gently
raised
,
and
a
musical
voice
cried
:
  
"
Haredale
,
my
dear
fellow
,
I
am
extremely
glad
to
see
you
.
 
<EOS>
How
very
much
you
have
improved
in
your
appearance
since
our
last
meeting
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
saw
you
looking
better
.
 
<EOS>
HOW
do
you
do
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
turned
his
eyes
towards
the
casement
whence
the
voice
proceeded
,
though
there
was
no
need
to
do
so
,
to
recognise
the
speaker
,
and
Mr
Chester
waved
his
hand
,
and
smiled
a
courteous
welcome
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
door
will
be
opened
immediately
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
nobody
but
a
very
dilapidated
female
to
perform
such
offices
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
excuse
her
infirmities
?
 
<EOS>
If
she
were
in
a
more
elevated
station
of
society
,
she
would
be
gouty
.
 
<EOS>
Being
but
a
hewer
of
wood
and
drawer
of
water
,
she
is
rheumatic
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
Haredale
,
these
are
natural
class
distinctions
,
depend
upon
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
,
whose
face
resumed
its
lowering
and
distrustful
look
the
moment
he
heard
the
voice
,
inclined
his
head
stiffly
,
and
turned
his
back
upon
the
speaker
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
opened
yet
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
hope
the
aged
soul
has
not
caught
her
foot
in
some
unlucky
cobweb
by
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
there
at
last
!
 
<EOS>
Come
in
,
I
beg
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
entered
,
followed
by
the
locksmith
.
 
<EOS>
Turning
with
a
look
of
great
astonishment
to
the
old
woman
who
had
opened
the
door
,
he
inquired
for
Mrs
Rudge
---
for
Barnaby
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
both
gone
,
she
replied
,
wagging
her
ancient
head
,
for
good
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
gentleman
in
the
parlour
,
who
perhaps
could
tell
them
more
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
all
SHE
knew
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
presenting
himself
before
this
new
tenant
,
"
where
is
the
person
whom
I
came
here
to
see
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
friend
,
"
he
returned
,
"
I
have
not
the
least
idea
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
trifling
is
ill
-
timed
,
"
retorted
the
other
in
a
suppressed
tone
and
voice
,
"
and
its
subject
ill
-
chosen
.
 
<EOS>
Reserve
it
for
those
who
are
your
friends
,
and
do
not
expend
it
on
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
lay
no
claim
to
the
distinction
,
and
have
the
self
-
denial
to
reject
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
good
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
"
you
are
heated
with
walking
.
<EOS>
Sit
down
,
I
beg
.
 
<EOS>
Our
friend
is
---
"
  
"
<EOS>
Is
but
a
plain
honest
man
,
"
returned
Mr
Haredale
,
"
and
quite
unworthy
of
your
notice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Gabriel
Varden
by
name
,
sir
<EOS>
,
"
said
the
locksmith
bluntly
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
worthy
English
yeoman
!
"
said
Mr
Chester
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
most
worthy
yeoman
,
of
whom
I
have
frequently
heard
my
son
Ned
---
darling
fellow
---
 
speak
,
and
have
often
wished
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
Varden
,
my
good
friend
<EOS>
,
I
am
glad
to
know
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
wonder
now
,
"
he
said
,
turning
languidly
to
Mr
Haredale
,
"
to
see
me
here
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
I
am
sure
you
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
glanced
at
him
---
not
fondly
or
admiringly
---
smiled
,
and
held
his
peace
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
mystery
is
solved
in
a
moment
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
;
"
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Will
you
step
aside
with
me
one
instant
.
 
<EOS>
You
remember
our
little
compact
in
reference
to
Ned
,
and
your
dear
niece
,
Haredale
?
 
<EOS>
You
remember
the
list
of
assistants
in
their
innocent
intrigue

<EOS>
You
remember
these
two
people
being
among
them
?
 
<EOS>
My
dear
fellow
,
congratulate
yourself
,
and
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
bought
them
off
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
done
what
?
"
said
Mr
Haredale
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bought
them
off
,
"
returned
his
smiling
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
found
it
necessary
to
take
some
active
steps
towards
setting
this
boy
and
girl
attachment
quite
at
rest

and
have
begun
by
removing
these
two
agents

You
are
surprised

Who

They
wanted
it
,
and
have
been
bought
off

We
have
nothing
more
to
fear
from
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
gone

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Gone
!
"
echoed
Mr
Haredale
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
fellow
---
and
you
must
permit
me
to
say
again
,
that
you
never
looked
so
young
;
so
positively
boyish
as
you
do
to
-
night
<EOS>
---
the
Lord
knows
where
;
I
believe
Columbus
himself
would
n't
find
them

<EOS>
Between
you
and
me
they
have
their
hidden
reasons
,
but
upon
that
point
I
have
pledged
myself
to
secrecy
.
 
<EOS>
She
appointed
to
see
you
here
to
-
night
,
I
know
,
but
found
it
inconvenient
,
and
could
n't
wait

<EOS>
Here
is
the
key
of
the
door

<EOS>
I
am
afraid
you
'll
find
it
inconveniently
large
;
but
as
the
tenement
is
yours

your
good

nature
will
excuse
that

Haredale

I
am
certain

Chapter

<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
stood
in
the
widow
's
parlour
with
the
door
-
key
in
his
hand
,
gazing
by
turns
at
Mr
Chester
and
at
Gabriel
Varden
,
and
occasionally
glancing
downward
at
the
key
as
in
the
hope
that
of
its
own
accord
it
would
unlock
the
mystery
;
until
Mr
Chester
,
putting
on
his
hat
and
gloves
,
and
sweetly
inquiring
whether
they
were
walking
in
the
same
direction
,
recalled
him
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Our
roads
diverge
---
<EOS>
widely
,
as
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
present
,
I
shall
remain
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
hipped
,
Haredale
;
you
will
be
miserable
,
<EOS>
melancholy
,
utterly
wretched
,
"
returned
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
place
of
the
very
last
description
for
a
man
of
your
temper
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
will
make
you
very
miserable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
it
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
sitting
down
;
"
and
thrive
upon
the
thought
.
 
<EOS>
Good
night
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Feigning
to
be
wholly
unconscious
of
the
abrupt
wave
of
the
hand
which
rendered
this
farewell
tantamount
to
a
dismissal
,
Mr
Chester
retorted
with
a
bland
and
heartfelt
benediction
,
and
inquired
of
Gabriel
in
what
direction
HE
was
going
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yours
,
sir
,
would
be
too
much
honour
for
the
like
of
me
,
"
replied
the
locksmith
,
hesitating
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
to
remain
here
a
little
while
,
Varden
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
without
looking
towards
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
word
or
two
to
say
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
intrude
upon
your
conference
another
moment
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
with
inconceivable
politeness
.
 
<EOS>
"
May
it
be
satisfactory
to
you
both
!
 
<EOS>
God
bless
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
and
bestowing
upon
the
locksmith
a
most
refulgent
smile
,
he
left
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
deplorably
constituted
creature
,
that
rugged
person
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
,
as
he
walked
along
the
street
;
"
he
is
an
atrocity
that
carries
its
own
punishment
along
with
it
---
a
bear
that
gnaws
himself
.
 
<EOS>
And
here
is
one
of
the
inestimable
advantages
of
having
a
perfect
command
over
one
's
inclinations
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
tempted
in
these
two
short
interviews
,
to
draw
upon
that
fellow
,
fifty
times
.
 
<EOS>
Five
men
in
six
would
have
yielded
to
the
impulse
.
 
<EOS>
By
suppressing
mine
,
I
wound
him
deeper
and
more
keenly
than
if
I
were
the
best
swordsman
in
all
Europe
,
and
he
the
worst
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
the
wise
man
's
very
last
resource
,
"
he
said
,
tapping
the
hilt
of
his
weapon
;
"
we
can
but
appeal
to
you
when
all
else
is
said
and
done
.
 
<EOS>
To
come
to
you
before
,
and
thereby
spare
our
adversaries
so
much
,
is
a
barbarian
mode
of
warfare
,
quite
unworthy
of
any
man
with
the
remotest
pretensions
to
delicacy
of
feeling
,
or
refinement
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
smiled
so
very
pleasantly
as
he
communed
with
himself
after
this
manner
,
that
a
beggar
was
emboldened
to
follow
for
alms
,
and
to
dog
his
footsteps
for
some
distance
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
gratified
by
the
circumstance
,
feeling
it
complimentary
to
his
power
of
feature
,
and
as
a
reward
suffered
the
man
to
follow
him
until
he
called
a
chair
,
when
he
graciously
dismissed
him
with
a
fervent
blessing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Which
is
as
easy
as
cursing
,
"
he
wisely
added
,
as
he
took
his
seat
,
"
and
more
becoming
to
the
face
.
<EOS>
---
To
Clerkenwell
,
my
good
creatures
,
if
you
please
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
chairmen
were
rendered
quite
vivacious
by
having
such
a
courteous
burden
,
and
to
Clerkenwell
they
went
at
a
fair
round
trot
.
  
<EOS>
Alighting
at
a
certain
point
he
had
indicated
to
them
upon
the
road
,
and
paying
them
something
less
than
they
expected
from
a
fare
of
such
gentle
speech
,
he
turned
into
the
street
in
which
the
locksmith
dwelt
,
and
presently
stood
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
Golden
Key
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tappertit
,
who
was
hard
at
work
by
lamplight
,
in
a
corner
of
the
workshop
,
remained
unconscious
of
his
presence
until
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder
made
him
start
and
turn
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Industry
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
"
is
the
soul
of
business
,
and
the
keystone
of
prosperity
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tappertit
,
I
shall
expect
you
to
invite
me
to
dinner
when
you
are
Lord
Mayor
of
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
returned
the
'
prentice
,
laying
down
his
hammer
,
and
rubbing
his
nose
on
the
back
of
a
very
sooty
hand
,
"
I
scorn
the
Lord
Mayor
and
everything
that
belongs
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
have
another
state
of
society
,
sir
,
before
you
catch
me
being
Lord
Mayor
.
 
<EOS>
How
de
do
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
better
,
Mr
Tappertit
,
for
looking
into
your
ingenuous
face
once
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
are
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
as
well
,
sir
,
"
said
Sim
,
standing
up
to
get
nearer
to
his
ear
,
and
whispering
hoarsely
,
"
as
any
man
can
be
under
the
aggrawations
to
which
I
am
exposed
.
 
<EOS>
My
life
's
a
burden
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
was
n't
for
wengeance
,
I
'd
play
at
pitch
and
toss
with
it
on
the
losing
hazard
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
Mrs
Varden
at
home
?
"
said
Mr
Chester
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
returned
Sim
,
eyeing
him
over
with
a
look
of
concentrated
expression
,
---
"
she
is
.
 
<EOS>
Did
you
wish
to
see
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Chester
nodded
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
come
this
way
,
sir
,
"
said
Sim
,
wiping
his
face
upon
his
apron
.
 
<EOS>
"
Follow
me
,
sir
.
---
Would
you
permit
me
to
whisper
in
your
ear
,
one
half
a
second
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
all
means
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Tappertit
raised
himself
on
tiptoe
,
applied
his
lips
to
Mr
Chester
's
ear
,
drew
back
his
head
without
saying
anything
,
looked
hard
at
him
,
applied
them
to
his
ear
again
,
again
drew
back
,
and
finally
whispered
---
"
<EOS>
The
name
is
Joseph
Willet
.
 
<EOS>
Hush
!
 
<EOS>
I
say
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Having
said
that
much
,
he
beckoned
the
visitor
with
a
mysterious
aspect
to
follow
him
to
the
parlour
-
door
,
where
he
announced
him
in
the
voice
of
a
gentleman
-
usher
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Chester
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
not
Mr
Ed'dard
,
mind
<EOS>
,
"
said
Sim
,
looking
into
the
door
again
,
and
adding
this
by
way
of
postscript
in
his
own
person
;
"
it
's
his
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
do
not
let
his
father
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
advancing
hat
in
hand
,
as
he
observed
the
effect
of
this
last
explanatory
announcement
<EOS>
,
"
do
not
let
his
father
be
any
check
or
restraint
on
your
domestic
occupations
,
Miss
Varden
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh

<EOS>
Now

<EOS>
There

<EOS>
An't

I
always
a

saying
it

exclaimed
Miggs
,
clapping
her
hands
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
he
an't
been
and
took
Missis
for
her
own
daughter

<EOS>
Well
,
she
DO
look

it

that
she
do

<EOS>
Only
think
of

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
possible
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
in
his
softest
tones
,
"
that
this
is
Mrs
Varden
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
amazed
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
not
your
daughter

Mrs
Varden

<EOS>
No

no

"
  
<EOS>
"
My

returned
Mrs
V
,
blushing
with
great
juvenility
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Mrs
Varden
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
visitor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
ma'am
---
humanity
is
indeed
a
happy
lot
,
when
we
can
repeat
ourselves
in
others
,
and
still
be
young
as
they
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
allow
me
to
salute
you
---
the
custom
of
the
country
,
my
dear
madam
---
your
daughter
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dolly
showed
some
reluctance
to
perform
this
ceremony
,
but
was
sharply
reproved
by
Mrs
Varden
,
who
insisted
on
her
undergoing
it
that
minute
.
 
<EOS>
For
pride
,
she
said
with
great
severity
,
was
one
of
the
seven
deadly
sins
,
and
humility
and
lowliness
of
heart
were
virtues
.
 
<EOS>
Wherefore
<EOS>
she
desired
that
Dolly
would
be
kissed
immediately
,
on
pain
of
her
just
displeasure
;
at
the
same
time
giving
her
to
understand
that
whatever
she
saw
her
mother
do
,
she
might
safely
do
herself
,
without
being
at
the
trouble
of
any
reasoning
or
reflection
on
the
subject
---
which
,
indeed
,
was
offensive
and
undutiful
,
and
in
direct
contravention
of
the
church
catechism
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
admonished
,
Dolly
complied
,
though
by
no
means
willingly
;
for
there
was
a
broad
,
bold
look
of
admiration
in
Mr
Chester
's
face
,
refined
and
polished
though
it
sought
to
be
,
which
distressed
her
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
As
she
stood
with
downcast
eyes
,
not
liking
to
look
up
and
meet
his
,
he
gazed
upon
her
with
an
approving
air
,
and
then
turned
to
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
friend
Gabriel
(
whose
acquaintance
I
only
made
this
very
evening
)
should
be
a
happy
man
,
Mrs
Varden
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ah
!
"
sighed
Mrs
V
,
shaking
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
echoed
Miggs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
the
case
?
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
compassionately
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Master
has
no
intentions
,
sir
,
"
murmured
Miggs
as
she
sidled
up
to
him
,
"
but
to
be
as
grateful
as
his
natur
will
let
him
,
for
everythink
he
owns
which
it
is
in
his
powers
to
appreciate
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
never
,
sir
"
---
said
Miggs
,
<EOS>
looking
sideways
at
Mrs
Varden
,
and
interlarding
her
discourse
with
a
sigh
---
"
we
never
know
the
full
value
of
SOME
wines
and
fig
-
trees
till
we
lose
'em
.
 
<EOS>
So
much
the
worse
,
sir
,
for
them
as
has
the
slighting
of
'em
on
their
consciences
when
they
're
gone
to
be
in
full
blow
elsewhere
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
Miss
Miggs
cast
up
her
eyes
to
signify
where
that
might
be
.
  
<EOS>
As
Mrs
Varden
distinctly
heard
,
and
was
intended
to
hear
,
all
that
Miggs
said
,
and
as
these
words
appeared
to
convey
in
metaphorical
terms
a
presage
or
foreboding
that
she
would
at
some
early
period
droop
beneath
her
trials
and
take
an
easy
flight
towards
the
stars
,
she
immediately
began
to
languish
,
and
taking
a
volume
of
the
Manual
from
a
neighbouring
table
,
leant
her
arm
upon
it
as
though
she
were
Hope
and
that
her
Anchor
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Chester
perceiving
this
,
and
seeing
how
the
volume
was
lettered
on
the
back
,
took
it
gently
from
her
hand
,
and
turned
the
fluttering
leaves
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
favourite
book
,
dear
madam

<EOS>
How
often

how
very
often
in
his
early
life

before
he
can
remember

---
(
this
clause
was
strictly
true
)
"
have
I
deduced
little
easy
moral
lessons
from
its
pages
,
for
my
dear
son
Ned

<EOS>
You
know
Ned
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
had
that
honour
,
and
a
fine
affable
young
gentleman
he
was
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
mother
,
Mrs
Varden
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
taking
a
pinch
of
snuff
,
"
and
you
know
what
I
,
as
a
father
,
feel
,
when
he
is
praised

<EOS>
He
gives
me
some
uneasiness
---
much
uneasiness
<EOS>
---
he
's
of
a
roving
nature
,
ma'am
---
from
flower
to
flower
---
from
sweet
to
sweet
---
but
his
is
the
butterfly
time
of
life
,
and
we
must
not
be
hard
upon
such
trifling
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
glanced
at
Dolly
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
attending
evidently
to
what
he
said
.
<EOS>
Just
what
he
desired
!
  
<EOS>
"
The
only
thing
I
object
to
in
this
little
trait
of
Ned
's
,
is
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
"
---
and
the
mention
of
his
name
reminds
me
,
by
the
way
,
that
I
am
about
to
beg
the
favour
of
a
minute
's
talk
with
you
alone
---
<EOS>
the
only
thing
I
object
to
in
it
,
is
,
that
it
DOES
partake
of
insincerity
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
however
I
may
attempt
to
disguise
the
fact
from
myself
in
my
affection
for
Ned
,
still
I
always
revert
to
this
---
 
<EOS>
that
if
we
are
not
sincere

Nothing

my

Mrs
Varden

Let

moral

strictly
just
(
though
always
with
a
leaning
towards
mercy
)
,
strictly
honest
,
and
strictly
true
,
and
we
gain
---
it
is
a
slight
point
,
certainly
,
but
still
it
is
something
tangible
;
we
throw
up
a
groundwork
and
foundation
,
so
to
speak
,
of
goodness
,
on
which
we
may
afterwards
erect
some
worthy
superstructure

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Now
,
to
be
sure
,
Mrs
Varden
thought
,
here
is
a
perfect
character
.
<EOS>
Here
is
a
meek
,
righteous
,
thoroughgoing
Christian
,
who
,
having
mastered
all
these
qualities
,
so
difficult
of
attainment
;
who
,
having
dropped
a
pinch
of
salt
on
the
tails
of
all
the
cardinal
virtues
,
and
caught
them
every
one
;
makes
light
of
their
possession
,
and
pants
for
more
morality
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
good
woman
never
doubted
(
as
many
good
men
and
women
never
do
)
,
that
this
slighting
kind
of
profession
,
this
setting
so
little
store
by
great
matters
,
this
seeming
to
say
,
"
I
am
not
proud
,
I
am
what
you
hear
,
but
I
consider
myself
no
better
than
other
people
;
let
us
change
the
subject
,
pray
"
---
was
perfectly
genuine
and
true
.
 
<EOS>
He
so
contrived
it
,
and
said
it
in
that
way
that
it
appeared
to
have
been
forced
from
him
,
and
its
effect
was
marvellous
.
  
<EOS>
Aware
of
the
impression
he
had
made
---
few
men
were
quicker
than
he
at
such
discoveries
---
Mr
Chester
followed
up
the
blow
by
propounding
certain
virtuous
maxims
,
somewhat
vague
and
general
in
their
nature
,
doubtless
,
and
occasionally
partaking
of
the
character
of
truisms
,
worn
a
little
out
at
elbow
,
but
delivered
in
so
charming
a
voice
and
with
such
uncommon
serenity
and
peace
of
mind
,
that
they
answered
as
well
as
the
best
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
is
this
to
be
wondered
at
;
for
as
hollow
vessels
produce
a
far
more
musical
sound
in
falling
than
those
which
are
substantial
,
so
it
will
oftentimes
be
found
that
sentiments
which
have
nothing
in
them
make
the
loudest
ringing
in
the
world
,
and
are
the
most
relished
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Chester
,
with
the
volume
gently
extended
in
one
hand
,
and
with
the
other
planted
lightly
on
his
breast
,
talked
to
them
in
the
most
delicious
manner
possible
;
and
quite
enchanted
all
his
hearers
,
notwithstanding
their
conflicting
interests
and
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
Even
Dolly
,
who
,
between
his
keen
regards
and
her
eyeing
over
by
Mr
Tappertit
,
was
put
quite
out
of
countenance
,
could
not
help
owning
within
herself
that
he
was
the
sweetest
-
spoken
gentleman
she
had
ever
seen
.
 
<EOS>
Even
Miss
Miggs
,
who
was
divided
between
admiration
of
Mr
Chester
and
a
mortal
jealousy
of
her
young
mistress
,
had
sufficient
leisure
to
be
propitiated
.
 
<EOS>
Even
Mr
Tappertit
,
though
occupied
as
we
have
seen
in
gazing
at
his
heart
's
delight
,
could
not
wholly
divert
his
thoughts
from
the
voice
of
the
other
charmer
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
,
to
her
own
private
thinking
,
had
never
been
so
improved
in
all
her
life
;
and
when
Mr
Chester
,
rising
and
craving
permission
to
speak
with
her
apart
,
took
her
by
the
hand
and
led
her
at
arm
's
length
upstairs
to
the
best
sitting
-
room
<EOS>
,
she
almost
deemed
him
something
more
than
human
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
madam
,
"
he
said
,
pressing
her
hand
delicately
to
his
lips
;
"
be
seated
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
called
up
quite
a
courtly
air
,
and
became
seated
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
guess
my
object
?
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
drawing
a
chair
towards
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
divine
my
purpose
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
an
affectionate
parent
,
my
dear
Mrs
Varden
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
I
am
sure
you
are

"
said
Mrs
V.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you

"
returned
Mr
Chester
,
tapping
his
snuff
-
box
lid
.
<EOS>
"
Heavy
moral
responsibilities
rest
with
parents
,
Mrs
Varden
.
"
  
Mrs
Varden
slightly
raised
her
hands
,
shook
her
head
,
and
looked
at
the
ground
as
though
she
saw
straight
through
the
globe
,
out
at
the
other
end
,
and
into
the
immensity
of
space
beyond
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
may
confide
in
you
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
"
without
reserve
.
 
<EOS>
I
love
my
son
,
ma'am
,
dearly
;
and
loving
him
as
I
do
,
I
would
save
him
from
working
certain
misery
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
of
his
attachment
to
Miss
Haredale
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
abetted
him
in
it
,
and
very
kind
of
you
<EOS>
it
was
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
deeply
obliged
to
you
---
most
deeply
obliged
to
you
---
 
for
your
interest
in
his
behalf
;
but
my
dear
ma'am
,
it
is
a
mistaken
one
,
I
do
assure
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
stammered
that
she
was
sorry
---
"
  
"
Sorry
,
my
dear
ma'am
,
"
he
interposed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
be
sorry
for
what
is
so
very
amiable
,
so
very
good
in
intention
,
so
perfectly
like
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
are
grave
and
weighty
reasons
,
pressing
family
considerations
,
and
apart
even
from
these
,
points
of
religious
difference
,
which
interpose
themselves
,
and
render
their
union
impossible
;
utterly
im
-
possible
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
mentioned
these
circumstances
to
your
husband
;
but
he
has
---
you
will
excuse
my
saying
this
so
freely
---
he
has
NOT
your
quickness
of
apprehension
or
depth
of
moral
sense
.
 
<EOS>
What
an
extremely
airy
house
this
is
,
and
how
beautifully
kept
!
 
<EOS>
For
one
like
myself
---
a
widower
so
long
---
 
these
tokens
of
female
care
and
superintendence
have
inexpressible
charms
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
began
to
think
(
she
scarcely
knew
why
)
that
the
young
Mr
Chester
must
be
in
the
wrong
and
the
old
Mr
Chester
must
he
in
the
right
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
son
Ned
,
"
resumed
her
tempter
with
his
most
winning
air
,
"
has
had
,
I
am
told
,
your
lovely
daughter
's
aid
,
and
your
open

hearted
husband

"
  
"
---
Much
more
than
mine
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Varden
;
"
a
great
deal
more
.
<EOS>
I
have
often
had
my
doubts
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
---
"
  
"
A
bad
example
,
"
suggested
Mr
Chester
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
.
 
<EOS>
No
doubt
it
is
.
<EOS>
Your
daughter
is
at
that
age
when
to
set
before
her
an
encouragement
for
young
persons
to
rebel
against
their
parents
on
this
most
important
point
,
is
particularly
injudicious
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
quite
right
.
 
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
thought
of
that
myself
,
but
it
escaped
me
<EOS>
,
I
confess
---
so
far
superior
are
your
sex
to
ours
,
<EOS>
dear
madam
,
in
point
of
penetration
and
sagacity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
looked
as
wise
as
if
she
had
really
said
something
to
deserve
this
compliment
---
firmly
believed
she
had
,
in
short
---
and
her
faith
in
her
own
shrewdness
increased
considerably
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
ma'am
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
"
you
embolden
me
to
be
plain
with
you

<EOS>
My
son
and
I
are
at
variance
on
this
point
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
lady
and
her
natural
guardian
differ
upon
it
,
also
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
closing
point
is
,
that
my
son
is
bound
by
his
duty
to
me

by
his
honour

by
every
solemn
tie

Mrs

holding
up

<EOS>
"
My

Expressly

purpose

<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Miss
Haredale

I
am
told
,
is
a
very
charming
creature
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
her
foster
-
mother
,
and
should
know
---
the
best
young
lady
in
the
world
,
"
said
Mrs
Varden
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
the
smallest
doubt
of
it

<EOS>
I
am
sure
she
is
.
 
<EOS>
And
you
,
who
have
stood
in
that
tender
relation
towards
her
,
are
bound
to
consult
her
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
can
I
---
as
I
have
said
to
Haredale
,
who
quite
agrees
---
can
I
possibly
stand
by
,
and
suffer
her
to
throw
herself
away
(
although
she
IS
of
a
Catholic
family
)
<EOS>
,
upon
a
young
fellow
who
,
as
yet
,
has
no
heart
at
all
?
 
<EOS>
It
is
no
imputation
upon
him
to
say
he
has
not
,
because
young
men
who
have
plunged
deeply
into
the
frivolities
and
conventionalities
of
society
,
very
seldom
have
.
 
<EOS>
Their
hearts
never
grow
,
my
dear
ma'am
,
till
after
thirty

<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
,
<EOS>
no
,
I
do
NOT
believe
,
that
I
had
any
heart
myself
when
I
was
Ned
's
age
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Varden
,
"
I
think
you
must
have
had

<EOS>
It

impossible

answered

shrugging
his
shoulders
meekly
,
"
I

little

Heaven

<EOS>
But
to
return
to
Ned
;
I
have
no
doubt
you
thought
,
and
therefore
interfered
benevolently
in
his

I
objected

How

!
 
<EOS>
My

I
object

him

to
him

emphatically
to
Ned
himself

"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
was
perfectly
aghast
at
the
disclosure
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
,
if
he
honourably
fulfils
this
solemn
obligation
of
which
I
have
told
you

he
must
be
honourable

he

a

his

He
is
of
most
expensive

ruinously
expensive
habits

and
if
,
in
a
moment
of
caprice

wilfulness
,
he
were
to
marry
this
young
lady

so
deprive
himself
of
the

gratifying
the
tastes

he
would

Mrs

my

I
put
it

such

Truly

thought
Mrs

this

she
added
aloud

not

Mrs

,
folding
her
hands
loftily

<EOS>
"
That

he

cried
Mr

<EOS>
"
Suppose
this
Joseph

It

bridling

It
is
like

has
done

you
would
not
on

because

tears

refrain
from
checking
their
inclinations

<EOS>
I
meant
to
have
reasoned
thus

My

emotion

returned
Mr

,
"
quite
so
strongly
as
you
might
desire

it
is
because
his
being
there

my

not
proving
conversational

led
me
hither

procured

With
that
he
took
Mrs
Varden

again

pressed
it
to
his
lips

the
highflown
gallantry
of
the
day
---
a
little
burlesqued
to
render
it
the
more
striking
in
the
good
lady
's
unaccustomed
eyes
---
proceeded
in
the
same
strain
of
mingled
sophistry
,
cajolery
,
and
flattery
,
to
entreat
that
her
utmost
influence
might
be
exerted
to
restrain
her
husband
and
daughter
from
any
further
promotion
of
Edward
's
suit
to
Miss
Haredale
,
and
from
aiding
or
abetting
either
party
in
any
way
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
was
but
a
woman
,
and
had
her
share
of
vanity
,
obstinacy
,
and
love
of
power
.
 
<EOS>
She
entered
into
a
secret
treaty
of
alliance
,
offensive
and
defensive
,
with
her
insinuating
visitor
;
and
really
did
believe
,
as
many
others
would
have
done
who
saw
and
heard
him
,
that
in
so
doing
she
furthered
the
ends
of
truth
,
justice
,
and
morality
,
in
a
very
uncommon
degree
.
  
<EOS>
Overjoyed
by
the
success
of
his
negotiation
,
and
mightily
amused
within
himself
,
Mr
Chester
conducted
her
downstairs
in
the
same
state
as
before
;
and
having
repeated
the
previous
ceremony
of
salutation
,
which
also
as
before
comprehended
Dolly
,
took
his
leave
;
first
completing
the
conquest
of
Miss
Miggs
's
heart
,
by
inquiring
if
"
this
young
lady
"
would
light
him
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
mim
,
"
said
Miggs
,
returning
with
the
candle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
gracious
me
,
mim
,
there
's
a
gentleman
!
 
<EOS>
Was
there
ever
such
an
angel
to
talk
as
he
is
---
and
such
a
sweet
-
looking
man
!
 
<EOS>
So
upright
and
noble
,
that
he
seems
to
despise
the
very
ground
he
walks
on
;
and
yet
so
mild
and
condescending
,
that
he
seems
to
say
"
<EOS>
but
I
will
take
notice
on
it
too
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
to
think
of
his
taking
you
for
Miss
Dolly
,
and
Miss
Dolly
for
your
sister
---
Oh
,
my
goodness
me
,
if
I
was
master
would
n't
I
be
jealous
of
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
reproved
her
handmaid
for
this
vain
-
speaking
;
but
very
gently
and
mildly
---
quite
smilingly
indeed
---
remarking
that
she
was
a
foolish
,
giddy
,
light
-
headed
girl
,
whose
spirits
carried
her
beyond
all
bounds
,
and
who
did
n't
mean
half
<EOS>
she
said
,
or
she
would
be
quite
angry
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
my
part
,
"
said
Dolly
,
in
a
thoughtful
manner
,
"
I
half
believe
Mr
Chester
is
something
like
Miggs
in
that
respect
.
 
<EOS>
For
all
his
politeness
and
pleasant
speaking
,
I
am
pretty
sure
he
was
making
game
of
us
,
more
than
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
venture
to
say
such
a
thing
again
,
and
to
speak
ill
of
people
behind
their
backs
in
my
presence
,
miss
,
"
said
Mrs
Varden
,
"
I
shall
insist
upon
your
taking
a
candle
and
going
to
bed
directly
.
 
<EOS>
How
dare
you
,
Dolly
?
 
<EOS>
I
'm
astonished
at
you
.
 
<EOS>
The
rudeness
of
your
whole
behaviour
this
evening
has
been
disgraceful
.
<EOS>
Did
anybody
ever
hear
,
"
cried
the
enraged
matron
,
bursting
into
tears
,
"
of
a
daughter
telling
her
own
mother
she
has
been
made
game
of
!
"
  
<EOS>
What
a
very
uncertain
temper
<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
's
was
!

Chapter
28
    
Repairing
to
a
noted
coffee
-
house
in
Covent
Garden
<EOS>
when
he
left
the
locksmith
's
,
Mr
Chester
sat
long
over
a
late
dinner
,
entertaining
himself
exceedingly
with
the
whimsical
recollection
of
his
recent
proceedings
,
and
congratulating
himself
very
much
on
his
great
cleverness
.
 
<EOS>
Influenced
by
these
thoughts
,
his
face
wore
an
expression
so
benign
and
tranquil
,
that
the
waiter
in
immediate
attendance
upon
him
felt
he
could
almost
have
died
in
his
defence
,
and
settled
in
his
own
mind
(
until
the
receipt
of
the
bill
,
and
a
very
small
fee
for
very
great
trouble
disabused
it
of
the
idea
)
that
such
an
apostolic
customer
was
worth
half
-
a
-
dozen
of
the
ordinary
run
of
visitors
,
at
least
.
  
<EOS>
A
visit
to
the
gaming
-
table
---
not
as
a
heated
,
anxious
venturer
,
but
one
whom
it
was
quite
a
treat
to
see
staking
his
two
or
three
pieces
in
deference
to
the
follies
of
society
,
and
smiling
with
equal
benevolence
on
winners
and
losers
---
made
it
late
before
he
reached
home
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
his
custom
to
bid
his
servant
<EOS>
go
to
bed
at
his
own
time
unless
he
had
orders
to
the
contrary
,
and
to
leave
a
candle
on
the
common
stair
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
lamp
on
the
landing
by
which
he
could
always
light
it
when
he
came
home
late
,
and
having
a
key
of
the
door
about
him
he
could
enter
and
go
to
bed
at
his
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
He
opened
the
glass
of
the
dull
lamp
,
whose
wick
,
burnt
up
and
swollen
like
a
drunkard
's
nose
,
came
flying
off
in
little
carbuncles
at
the
candle
's
touch
,
and
scattering
hot
sparks
about
,
rendered
it
matter
of
some
difficulty
to
kindle
the
lazy
taper
;
when
a
noise
,
as
of
a
man
snoring
deeply
some
steps
higher
up
,
caused
him
to
pause
and
listen
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
heavy
breathing
of
a
sleeper
,
close
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Some
fellow
had
lain
down
on
the
open
staircase
,
and
was
slumbering
soundly
.
 
<EOS>
Having
lighted
the
candle
at
length
and
opened
his
own
door
,
he
softly
ascended
,
holding
the
taper
high
above
his
head
,
and
peering
cautiously
about
;
curious
to
see
what
kind
of
man
had
chosen
so
comfortless
a
shelter
for
his
lodging
.
  
<EOS>
With
his
head
upon
the
landing
and
his
great
limbs
flung
over
half
-
a
-
dozen
stairs
,
as
carelessly
as
though
he
were
a
dead
man
whom
drunken
bearers
had
thrown
down
by
chance
,
there
lay
Hugh
,
face
uppermost
,
his
long
hair
drooping
like
some
wild
weed
upon
his
wooden
pillow
,
and
his
huge
chest
heaving
with
the
sounds
which
so
unwontedly
disturbed
the
place
and
hour
.
  
<EOS>
He
who
came
upon
him
so
unexpectedly
was
about
to
break
his
rest
by
thrusting
him
with
his
foot
,
when
,
glancing
at
his
upturned
face
,
he
arrested
himself
in
the
very
action
,
and
stooping
down
and
shading
the
candle
with
his
hand
,
examined
his
features
closely
.
<EOS>
Close
as
his
first
inspection
was
,
it
did
not
suffice
,
for
he
passed
the
light
,
still
carefully
shaded
as
before
,
across
and
across
his
face
,
and
yet
observed
him
with
a
searching
eye
.
  
<EOS>
While
he
was
thus
engaged
,
the
sleeper
,
without
any
starting
or
turning
round
,
awoke
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
kind
of
fascination
in
meeting
his
steady
gaze
so
suddenly
,
which
took
from
the
other
the
presence
of
mind
to
withdraw
his
eyes
,
and
forced
him
,
as
it
were
,
to
meet
his
look
.
 
<EOS>
So
they
remained
staring
at
each
other
,
until
Mr
Chester
at
last
broke
silence
,
and
asked
him
in
a
low
voice
,
why
he
lay
sleeping
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
,
"
said
Hugh
,
struggling
into
a
sitting
posture
and
gazing
at
him
intently
,
still
,
"
that
you
were
a
part
of
my
dream
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
curious
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
it
may
never
come
true
,
master
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
makes
you
shiver
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
---
the
cold
,
I
suppose
,
"
he
growled
,
as
he
shook
himself
and
rose
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
know
where
I
am
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
me
?
"
said
Mr
Chester
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ay
,
I
know
you
,
"
he
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
dreaming
of
you
<EOS>
---
we
're
not
where
I
thought
we
were
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
a
comfort
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
round
him
as
he
spoke
,
and
in
particular
looked
above
his
head
,
as
though
he
half
expected
to
be
standing
under
some
object
which
had
had
existence
in
his
dream
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
rubbed
his
eyes
and
shook
himself
again
,
and
followed
his
conductor
into
his
own
rooms
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Chester
lighted
the
candles
which
stood
upon
his
dressing
-
table
,
and
wheeling
an
easy
-
chair
towards
the
fire
,
which
was
yet
burning
,
stirred
up
a
cheerful
blaze
,
sat
down
before
it
,
and
bade
his
uncouth
visitor
"
Come
here
,
"
and
draw
his
boots
off
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
drinking
again
,
my
fine
fellow
,
"
he
said
,
as
Hugh
went
down
on
one
knee
,
and
did
as
he
was
told
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
I
'm
alive
,
master
,
I
've
walked
the
twelve
long
miles
,
and
waited
here
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
long
,
and
had
no
drink
between
my
lips
since
dinner
-
time
at
noon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
can
you
do
nothing
better
,
my
pleasant
friend
,
than
fall
asleep
,
and
shake
the
very
building
with
your
snores
?
"
said
Mr
Chester
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ca
n't
you
dream
in
your
straw
at
home
,
dull
dog
as
you
are
,
that
you
need
come
here
to
do
it
?
---
<EOS>
Reach
me
those
slippers
,
and
tread
softly
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
obeyed
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
harkee
,
my
dear
young
gentleman
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
as
he
put
them
on
,
"
the
next
time
you
dream
,
do
n't
let
it
be
of
me
,
but
of
some
dog
or
horse
with
whom
you
are
better
acquainted
.
 
<EOS>
Fill
the
glass
once
<EOS>
---
you
'll
find
it
and
the
bottle
in
the
same
place
---
and
empty
it
to
keep
yourself
awake
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
obeyed
again
even
more
zealously
---
and
having
done
so
,
presented
himself
before
his
patron
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
"
what
do
you
want
with
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
was
news
to
-
day
,
"
returned
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
son
was
at
our
house
---
came
down
on
horseback
.
 
<EOS>
He
tried
to
see
the
young
woman
,
but
could
n't
get
sight
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
left
some
letter
or
some
message
which
our
Joe
had
charge
of
,
but
he
and
the
old
one
quarrelled
about
it
when
your
son
had
gone
,
and
the
old
one
would
n't
let
it
be
delivered
.
 
<EOS>
He
says
(
that
's
the
old
one
does
)
that
none
of
his
people
shall
interfere
and
get
him
into
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
a
landlord
,
he
says
,
and
lives
on
everybody
's
custom
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
jewel
,
"
smiled
Mr
Chester
,
"
and
the
better
for
being
a
dull
one
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Well
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Varden
's
daughter
<EOS>
---
that
's
the
girl
I
kissed
---
"
  
"
---
and
stole
the
bracelet
from
upon
the
king
's
highway
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
composedly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
what
of
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
wrote
a
note
at
our
house
to
the
young
woman
,
saying
she
lost
the
letter
I
brought
to
you
,
and
you
burnt
.
 
<EOS>
Our
Joe
was
to
carry
it
,
but
the
old
one
kept
him
at
home
all
next
day
,
on
purpose
that
he
should
n't
.
 
<EOS>
Next
morning
he
gave
it
to
me
to
take
;
and
here
it
is
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
did
n't
deliver
it
then
,
my
good
friend
?
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
twirling
Dolly
's
note
between
his
finger
and
thumb
,
and
feigning
to
be
surprised
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
supposed
you
'd
want
to
have
it
,
"
retorted
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Burn
one
,
burn
all
,
I
thought
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
devil
-
may
-
care
acquaintance
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
---
"
really
if
you
do
not
draw
some
nicer
distinctions
,
your
career
will
be
cut
short
with
most
surprising
suddenness
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
know
that
the
letter
you
brought
to
me
,
was
directed
to
my
son
who
resides
in
this
very
place
?
 
<EOS>
And
can
you
descry
no
difference
between
his
letters
and
those
addressed
to
other
people
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
n't
want
it
,
"
said
Hugh
,
disconcerted
by
this
reproof
,
for
he
had
expected
high
praise
,
"
give
it
me
back
,
and
I
'll
deliver
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
to
please
you
,
master
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
deliver
it
,
"
returned
his
patron
,
putting
it
away
after
a
moment
's
consideration
,
"
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Does
the
young
lady
walk
out
,
on
fine
mornings
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mostly
---
about
noon
is
her
usual
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Alone
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
grounds
before
the
house
.
<EOS>
---
Them
that
the
footpath
crosses
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
If
the
weather
should
be
fine
,
I
may
throw
myself
in
her
way
to
-
morrow
,
perhaps
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
as
coolly
as
if
she
were
one
of
his
ordinary
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Hugh
,
if
I
should
ride
up
to
the
Maypole
door
,
you
will
do
me
the
favour
only
to
have
seen
me
once
.
<EOS>
You
must
suppress
your
gratitude
,
and
endeavour
to
forget
my
forbearance
in
the
matter
of
the
bracelet
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
natural
it
should
break
out
,
and
it
does
you
honour
;
but
when
other
folks
are
by
,
you
must
,
for
your
own
sake
and
safety
,
be
as
like
your
usual
self
as
though
you
owed
me
no
obligation
whatever
,
and
had
never
stood
within
these
walls
.
 
<EOS>
You
comprehend
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
understood
him
perfectly
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
pause
he
muttered
that
he
hoped
his
patron
would
involve
him
in
no
trouble
about
this
last
letter
;
for
he
had
kept
it
back
solely
with
the
view
of
pleasing
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
continuing
in
this
strain
,
when
Mr
Chester
with
a
most
beneficent
and
patronising
air
cut
him
short
by
saying
:
  
"
My
good
fellow
,
you
have
my
promise
,
my
word
,
my
sealed
bond
(
for
a
verbal
pledge
with
me
is
quite
as
good
)
,
that
I
will
always
protect
you
so
long
as
you
deserve
it
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
do
set
your
mind
at
rest
.
 
<EOS>
Keep
it
at
ease
,
I
beg
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
When
a
man
puts
himself
in
my
power
so
thoroughly
as
you
have
done
,
I
really
feel
as
though
he
had
a
kind
of
claim
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
more
disposed
to
mercy
and
forbearance
under
such
circumstances
than
I
can
tell
you
,
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
Do
look
upon
me
as
your
protector
,
and
rest
assured
<EOS>
,
I
entreat
you
,
that
on
the
subject
of
that
indiscretion
,
you
may
preserve
,
as
long
as
you
and
I
are
friends
,
the
lightest
heart
that
ever
beat
within
a
human
breast
.
 
<EOS>
Fill
that
glass
once
more
to
cheer
you
on
your
road
homewards
---
I
am
really
quite
ashamed
to
think
how
far
you
have
to
go
---
and
then
God
bless
you
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
They
think
,
"
said
Hugh
,
when
he
had
tossed
the
liquor
down
,
"
that
I
am
sleeping
soundly
in
the
stable
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
ha
ha
!
 
<EOS>
The
stable
door
is
shut
,
but
the
steed
's
gone
,
master
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
most
convivial
fellow
,
"
returned
his
friend
,
"
and
I
love
your
humour
of
all
things
.
 
<EOS>
Good
night
!
 
<EOS>
Take
the
greatest
possible
care
of
yourself
,
for
my
sake
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
remarkable
that
during
the
whole
interview
,
each
had
endeavoured
to
catch
stolen
glances
of
the
other
's
face
,
and
had
never
looked
full
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
interchanged
one
brief
and
hasty
glance
as
Hugh
went
out
,
averted
their
eyes
directly
,
and
so
separated
.
 
<EOS>
Hugh
closed
the
double
doors
behind
him
,
carefully
and
without
noise
;
and
Mr
Chester
remained
in
his
easy
-
chair
,
with
his
gaze
intently
fixed
upon
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
after
meditating
for
a
long
time
---
and
said
with
a
deep
sigh
and
an
uneasy
shifting
of
his
attitude
,
as
though
he
dismissed
some
other
subject
from
his
thoughts
,
and
returned
to
that
which
had
held
possession
of
them
all
the
day
---
the
plot
thickens
;
I
have
thrown
the
shell
;
it
will
explode
,
I
think
,
in
eight
-
and
-
forty
hours
,
and
should
scatter
these
good
folks
amazingly
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
see
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
went
to
bed
and
fell
asleep
,
but
had
not
slept
long
when
he
started
up
and
thought
that
Hugh
was
at
the
outer
door
,
calling
in
a
strange
voice
,
very
different
from
his
own
,
to
be
admitted
.
 
<EOS>
The
delusion
was
so
strong
upon
him
,
and
was
so
full
of
that
vague
terror
of
the
night
in
which
such
visions
have
their
being
,
that
he
rose
,
and
taking
his
sheathed
sword
in
his
hand
,
opened
the
door
,
and
looked
out
upon
the
staircase
,
and
towards
the
spot
where
Hugh
had
lain
asleep
;
and
even
spoke
to
him
by
name
.
 
<EOS>
But
all
was
dark
and
quiet
,
and
creeping
back
to
bed
again
<EOS>
,
he
fell
,
after
an
hour
's
uneasy
watching
,
into
a
second
sleep
,
and
woke
no
more
till
morning
.

Chapter
29
    
<EOS>
The
thoughts
of
worldly
men
are
for
ever
regulated
by
a
moral
law
of
gravitation
,
which
,
like
the
physical
one
,
holds
them
down
to
earth
.
 
<EOS>
The
bright
glory
of
day
,
and
the
silent
wonders
of
a
starlit
night
<EOS>
,
appeal
to
their
minds
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
no
signs
in
the
sun
,
or
in
the
moon
,
or
in
the
stars
,
for
their
reading
.
<EOS>
They
are
like
some
wise
men
,
who
,
learning
to
know
each
planet
by
its
Latin
name
,
have
quite
forgotten
such
small
heavenly
constellations
as
Charity
,
Forbearance
,
Universal
Love
,
and
Mercy
,
although
they
shine
by
night
and
day
so
brightly
that
the
blind
may
see
them
;
and
who
,
looking
upward
at
the
spangled
sky
,
see
nothing
there
<EOS>
but
the
reflection
of
their
own
great
wisdom
and
book
-
learning
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
curious
to
imagine
these
people
of
the
world
,
busy
in
thought
,
turning
their
eyes
towards
the
countless
spheres
that
shine
above
us
,
and
making
them
reflect
the
only
images
their
minds
contain
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
who
lives
<EOS>
but
in
the
breath
of
princes
,
has
nothing
his
sight
but
stars
for
courtiers
'
breasts
.
 
<EOS>
The
envious
man
beholds
his
neighbours
'
honours
even
in
the
sky
;
to
the
money
-
hoarder
,
and
the
mass
of
worldly
folk
,
the
whole
great
universe
above
glitters
with
sterling
coin
---
fresh
from
the
mint
---
stamped
with
the
sovereign
's
head
---
coming
always
between
them
and
heaven
,
turn
where
they
may
.
 
<EOS>
So
do
the
shadows
of
our
own
desires
stand
between
us
and
our
better
angels
,
and
thus
their
brightness
is
eclipsed
.
  
<EOS>
Everything
was
fresh
and
gay
,
as
though
the
world
were
but
that
morning
made
,
when
Mr
Chester
rode
at
a
tranquil
pace
along
the
Forest
road
.
 
<EOS>
Though
early
in
the
season
,
it
was
warm
and
genial
weather
;
the
trees
were
budding
into
leaf
,
the
hedges
and
the
grass
were
green
,
the
air
was
musical
with
songs
of
birds
,
and
high
above
them
<EOS>
all
the
lark
poured
out
her
richest
melody
.
 
<EOS>
In
shady
spots
,
the
morning
dew
sparkled
on
each
young
leaf
and
blade
of
grass
;
and
where
the
sun
was
shining
,
some
diamond
drops
yet
glistened
brightly
,
as
in
unwillingness
to
leave
so
fair
a
world
,
and
have
such
brief
existence
.
 
<EOS>
Even
the
light
wind
,
whose
rustling
was
as
gentle
to
the
ear
as
softly
-
falling
water
,
had
its
hope
and
promise
;
and
,
leaving
a
pleasant
fragrance
in
its
track
as
it
went
fluttering
by
,
whispered
of
its
intercourse
with
Summer
,
and
of
his
happy
coming
.
  
<EOS>
The
solitary
rider
went
glancing
on
among
the
trees
,
from
sunlight
into
shade
and
back
again
,
at
the
same
even
pace
---
looking
about
him
,
certainly
,
from
time
to
time
,
but
with
no
greater
thought
of
the
day
or
the
scene
through
which
he
moved
,
than
that
he
was
fortunate
(
being
choicely
dressed
)
to
have
such
favourable
weather
.
<EOS>
He
smiled
very
complacently
at
such
times
,
but
rather
as
if
he
were
satisfied
with
himself
than
with
anything
else
:
and
so
went
riding
on
,
upon
his
chestnut
cob
,
as
pleasant
to
look
upon
as
his
own
horse
,
and
probably
far
less
sensitive
to
the
many
cheerful
influences
by
which
he
was
surrounded
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
time
,
the
Maypole
's
massive
chimneys
rose
upon
his
view
:
but
he
quickened
not
his
pace
one
jot
,
and
with
the
same
cool
gravity
rode
up
to
the
tavern
porch
.
 
<EOS>
John
Willet
,
who
was
toasting
his
red
face
before
a
great
fire
in
the
bar
,
and
who
,
with
surpassing
foresight
and
quickness
of
apprehension
,
had
been
thinking
,
as
he
looked
at
the
blue
sky
,
that
if
that
state
of
things
lasted
much
longer
,
it
might
ultimately
become
necessary
to
leave
off
fires
and
throw
the
windows
open
,
issued
forth
to
hold
his
stirrup
;
calling
lustily
for
Hugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
're
here
,
are
you
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
said
John
,
rather
surprised
by
the
quickness
with
which
he
appeared
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
this
here
valuable
animal
into
the
stable
,
and
have
more
than
particular
care
of
him
if
you
want
to
keep
your
place
.
 
<EOS>
A
mortal
lazy
fellow
,
sir
<EOS>
;
he
needs
a
deal
of
looking
after
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
have
a
son
,
"
returned
Mr
Chester
,
giving
his
bridle
to
Hugh
as
he
dismounted
,
and
acknowledging
his
salute
by
a
careless
motion
of
his
hand
towards
his
hat
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
do
n't
you
make
HIM
useful
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
the
truth
is
,
sir
,
"
replied
John
with
great
importance
,
"
that
my
son
---
what
,
you
're
a
-
listening
<EOS>
are
you
,
villain
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
's
listening
?
"
returned
Hugh
angrily
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
treat
,
indeed
,
to
hear
YOU
speak
!
 
<EOS>
Would
you
have
me
take
him
in
till
he
's
cool
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Walk
him
up
and
down
further
off
then
,
sir
,
"
cried
old
John
,
"
and
when
you
see
me
and
a
noble
gentleman
entertaining
ourselves
with
talk
,
keep
your
distance
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
do
n't
know
your
distance
,
sir
,
"
added
Mr
Willet
,
after
an
enormously
long
pause
,
during
which
he
fixed
his
great
dull
eyes
on
Hugh
,
and
waited
with
exemplary
patience
for
any
little
property
in
the
way
of
ideas
that
might
come
to
him
,
"
we
'll
find
a
way
to
teach
you
,
pretty
soon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
shrugged
his
shoulders
scornfully
,
and
in
his
reckless
swaggering
way
,
crossed
to
the
other
side
of
the
little
green
,
and
there
,
with
the
bridle
slung
loosely
over
his
shoulder
,
led
the
horse
to
and
fro
,
glancing
at
his
master
every
now
and
then
from
under
his
bushy
eyebrows
,
with
as
sinister
an
aspect
as
one
would
desire
to
see
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Chester
,
who
,
without
appearing
to
do
so
,
had
eyed
him
attentively
during
this
brief
dispute
,
stepped
into
the
porch
,
and
turning
abruptly
to
Mr
Willet
,
said
,
  
"
You
keep
strange
servants
,
John
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Strange
enough
to
look
at
,
sir
,
certainly
,
"
answered
the
host
;
"
but
out
of
doors
;
for
horses
,
dogs
,
and
the
likes
of
that
;
there
an't
a
better
man
in
England
than
is
that
Maypole
Hugh
yonder
.
 
<EOS>
He
an't
fit
for
indoors
,
"
added
Mr
Willet
,
with
the
confidential
air
of
a
man
who
felt
his
own
superior
nature
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
that
;
but
if
that
chap
had
only
a
little
imagination
,
sir
---
"
  
"
He
's
an
active
fellow
now
<EOS>
,
I
dare
swear
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
in
a
musing
tone
,
which
seemed
to
suggest
that
he
would
have
said
the
same
had
there
been
nobody
to
hear
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Active
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
retorted
John
,
with
quite
an
expression
in
his
face
;
"
that
chap
!
 
<EOS>
Hallo
there
!
 
<EOS>
You
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
Bring
that
horse
here
,
and
go
and
hang
my
wig
on
the
weathercock
,
to
show
this
gentleman
whether
you
're
one
of
the
lively
sort
or
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
made
no
answer
,
but
throwing
the
bridle
to
his
master
,
and
snatching
his
wig
from
his
head
,
in
a
manner
so
unceremonious
and
hasty
that
the
action
discomposed
Mr
Willet
not
a
little
,
though
performed
at
his
own
special
desire
,
climbed
nimbly
to
the
very
summit
of
the
maypole
before
the
house
,
and
hanging
the
wig
upon
the
weathercock
,
sent
it
twirling
round
like
a
roasting
jack
.
<EOS>
Having
achieved
this
performance
,
he
cast
it
on
the
ground
,
and
sliding
down
the
pole
with
inconceivable
rapidity
,
alighted
on
his
feet
almost
as
soon
as
it
had
touched
the
earth
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
sir
,
"
said
John
,
relapsing
into
his
usual
stolid
state
,
"
you
wo
n't
see
that
at
many
houses
,
besides
the
Maypole
,
where
there
's
good
accommodation
for
man
and
beast
---
nor
that
neither
,
though
that
with
him
is
nothing
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
last
remark
bore
reference
to
his
vaulting
on
horseback
,
as
upon
Mr
Chester
's
first
visit
,
and
quickly
disappearing
by
the
stable
gate
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
with
him
is
nothing
,
"
repeated
Mr
Willet
,
brushing
his
wig
with
his
wrist
,
and
inwardly
resolving
to
distribute
a
small
charge
for
dust
and
damage
to
that
article
of
dress
,
through
the
various
items
of
his
guest
's
bill
;
"
he
'll
get
out
of
a'most
any
winder
in
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
There
never
was
such
a
chap
for
flinging
himself
about
and
never
hurting
his
bones
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
my
opinion
,
sir
,
that
it
's
pretty
nearly
allowing
to
his
not
having
any
imagination
;
and
that
if
imagination
could
be
(
which
it
ca
n't
)
knocked
into
him
,
he
'd
never
be
able
to
do
it
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
was
a
-
talking
,
sir
,
about
my
son
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
True
,
Willet
,
true
,
"
said
his
visitor
,
turning
again
towards
the
landlord
with
his
accustomed
serenity
of
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
good
friend
,
what
about
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
has
been
reported
that
Mr
Willet
,
previously
to
making
answer
,
winked
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
he
was
never
known
to
be
guilty
of
such
lightness
of
conduct
either
before
or
afterwards
,
this
may
be
looked
upon
as
a
malicious
invention
of
his
enemies
---
founded
,
perhaps
,
upon
the
undisputed
circumstance
of
his
taking
his
guest
by
the
third
breast
button
of
his
coat
,
counting
downwards
from
the
chin
,
and
pouring
his
reply
into
his
ear
:
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
whispered
John
,
with
dignity
,
"
I
know
my
duty
.
 
<EOS>
We
want
no
love
-
making
here
,
sir
,
unbeknown
to
parents
.
 
<EOS>
I
respect
a
certain
young
gentleman
,
taking
him
in
the
light
of
a
young
gentleman
;
I
respect
a
certain
young
lady
,
taking
her
in
the
light
of
a
young
lady
;
but
of
the
two
as
a
couple
,
I
have
no
knowledge
,
sir
,
none
whatever
.
 
<EOS>
My
son
,
sir
,
is
upon
his
patrole
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
I
saw
him
looking
through
the
corner
window
<EOS>
but
this
moment
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
who
naturally
thought
that
being
on
patrole
,
implied
walking
about
somewhere
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
you
did
,
sir
,
"
returned
John
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
upon
his
patrole
of
honour
,
sir
,
not
to
leave
the
premises
.
 
<EOS>
Me
and
some
friends
of
mine
that
use
the
Maypole
of
an
evening
,
sir
,
considered
what
was
best
to
be
done
with
him
,
to
prevent
his
doing
anything
unpleasant
in
opposing
your
desires
;
and
we
've
put
him
on
his
patrole
.
 
<EOS>
And
what
's
more
,
sir
,
he
wo
n't
be
off
his
patrole
for
a
pretty
long
time
to
come
,
I
can
tell
you
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
When
he
had
communicated
this
bright
idea
,
which
had
its
origin
in
the
perusal
by
the
village
cronies
of
a
newspaper
,
containing
,
among
other
matters
,
an
account
of
how
some
officer
pending
the
sentence
of
some
court
-
martial
had
been
enlarged
on
parole
,
Mr
Willet
drew
back
from
his
guest
's
ear
,
and
without
any
visible
alteration
of
feature
,
chuckled
thrice
audibly
.
 
<EOS>
This
nearest
approach
to
a
laugh
in
which
he
ever
indulged
(
and
that
<EOS>
but
seldom
and
only
on
extreme
occasions
)
,
never
even
curled
his
lip
or
effected
the
smallest
change
in
---
no
,
not
so
much
as
a
slight
wagging
of
---
his
great
,
fat
,
double
chin
,
which
at
these
times
,
as
at
all
others
,
remained
a
perfect
desert
in
the
broad
map
of
his
face
;
one
changeless
,
dull
,
tremendous
blank
.
  
<EOS>
Lest
it
should
be
matter
of
surprise
to
any
,
that
Mr
Willet
adopted
this
bold
course
in
opposition
to
one
whom
he
had
often
entertained
,
and
who
had
always
paid
his
way
at
the
Maypole
gallantly
,
it
may
be
remarked
that
it
was
his
very
penetration
and
sagacity
in
this
respect
,
which
occasioned
him
to
indulge
in
those
unusual
demonstrations
of
jocularity
,
just
now
recorded
.
 
<EOS>
For
Mr
Willet
,
after
carefully
balancing
father
and
son
in
his
mental
scales
,
had
arrived
at
the
distinct
conclusion
that
the
old
gentleman
was
a
better
sort
of
a
customer
than
the
young
one
.
<EOS>
Throwing
his
landlord
into
the
same
scale
,
which
was
already
turned
by
this
consideration
,
and
heaping
upon
him
,
again
,
his
strong
desires
to
run
counter
to
the
unfortunate
Joe
,
and
his
opposition
as
a
general
principle
to
all
matters
of
love
and
matrimony
,
it
went
down
to
the
very
ground
straightway
,
and
sent
the
light
cause
of
the
younger
gentleman
flying
upwards
to
the
ceiling
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Chester
was
not
the
kind
of
man
to
be
by
any
means
dim
-
sighted
to
Mr
Willet
's
motives
,
but
he
thanked
him
as
graciously
as
if
he
had
been
one
of
the
most
disinterested
martyrs
that
ever
shone
on
earth
;
and
leaving
him
,
with
many
complimentary
reliances
on
his
great
taste
and
judgment
,
to
prepare
whatever
dinner
he
might
deem
most
fitting
the
occasion
,
bent
his
steps
towards
the
Warren
.
  
<EOS>
Dressed
with
more
than
his
usual
elegance
;
assuming
a
gracefulness
of
manner
,
which
,
though
it
was
the
result
of
long
study
,
sat
easily
upon
him
and
became
him
well
;
composing
his
features
into
their
most
serene
and
prepossessing
expression
;
and
setting
in
short
that
guard
upon
himself
,
at
every
point
,
which
denoted
that
he
attached
no
slight
importance
to
the
impression
he
was
about
to
make
;
he
entered
the
bounds
of
Miss
Haredale
's
usual
walk
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
not
gone
far
,
or
looked
about
him
long
,
when
he
descried
coming
towards
him
,
a
female
figure
.
 
<EOS>
A
glimpse
of
the
form
and
dress
as
she
crossed
a
little
wooden
bridge
which
lay
between
them
,
satisfied
him
that
he
had
found
her
whom
he
desired
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
He
threw
himself
in
her
way
,
and
a
very
few
paces
brought
them
close
together
.
  
<EOS>
He
raised
his
hat
from
his
head
,
and
yielding
the
path
,
suffered
her
to
pass
him
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
as
if
the
idea
had
but
that
moment
occurred
to
him
,
he
turned
hastily
back
and
said
in
an
agitated
voice
:
  
"
I
beg
pardon
---
do
I
address
Miss
Haredale
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
stopped
in
some
confusion
at
being
so
unexpectedly
accosted
by
a
stranger
;
and
answered
"
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Something
told
me
,
"
he
said
,
LOOKING
a
compliment
to
her
beauty
,
"
that
it
could
be
no
other
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Haredale
,
I
bear
a
name
which
is
not
unknown
to
you
---
which
it
is
a
pride
,
and
yet
a
pain
to
me
to
know
,
sounds
pleasantly
in
your
ears
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
a
man
advanced
in
life
,
as
you
see
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
the
father
of
him
whom
you
honour
and
distinguish
above
all
other
men
.
 
<EOS>
May
I
for
weighty
reasons
which
fill
me
with
distress
,
beg
but
a
minute
's
conversation
with
you
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Who
that
was
inexperienced
in
deceit
,
and
had
a
frank
and
youthful
heart
,
could
doubt
the
speaker
's
truth
---
could
doubt
it
too
,
when
the
voice
that
spoke
,
was
like
the
faint
echo
of
one
she
knew
so
well
,
and
so
much
loved
to
hear
?
 
<EOS>
She
inclined
her
head
,
and
stopping
,
cast
her
eyes
upon
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
little
more
apart
---
among
these
trees
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
an
old
man
's
hand
,
Miss
Haredale
;
an
honest
one
,
believe
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
put
hers
in
it
as
he
said
these
words
,
and
suffered
him
to
lead
her
to
a
neighbouring
seat
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
alarm
me
,
sir
,
"
she
said
in
a
low
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
the
bearer
of
any
ill
news
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
none
that
you
anticipate
,
"
he
answered
,
sitting
down
beside
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Edward
is
well
---
quite
well
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
of
him
I
wish
to
speak
,
certainly
;
but
I
have
no
misfortune
to
communicate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
bowed
her
head
again
,
and
made
as
though
she
would
have
begged
him
to
proceed
;
but
said
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sensible
that
I
speak
to
you
at
a
disadvantage
,
dear
Miss
Haredale
.
 
<EOS>
Believe
me
that
I
am
not
so
forgetful
of
the
feelings
of
my
younger
days
as
not
to
know
that
you
are
little
disposed
to
view
me
with
favour
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
heard
me
described
as
cold
-
hearted
,
calculating
,
selfish
---
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
,
sir
,
<EOS>
"
---
she
interposed
with
an
altered
manner
and
a
firmer
voice
;
"
I
have
never
heard
you
spoken
of
in
harsh
or
disrespectful
terms
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
a
great
wrong
to
Edward
's
nature
if
you
believe
him
capable
of
any
mean
or
base
proceeding
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
,
my
sweet
young
lady
,
but
your
uncle
---
"
  
"
<EOS>
Nor
is
it
my
uncle
's
nature
either
,
"
she
replied
,
with
a
heightened
colour
in
her
cheek
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
his
nature
to
stab
in
the
dark
,
nor
is
it
mine
to
love
such
deeds
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
rose
as
she
spoke
,
and
would
have
left
him
;
but
he
detained
her
with
a
gentle
hand
,
and
besought
her
in
such
persuasive
accents
to
hear
him
but
another
minute
,
that
she
was
easily
prevailed
upon
to
comply
,
and
so
sat
down
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
it
is
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
looking
upward
,
and
apostrophising
the
air
;
"
it
is
this
frank
,
ingenuous
,
noble
nature
,
Ned
,
that
you
can
wound
so
lightly
.
 
<EOS>
Shame
<EOS>
---
shame
upon
you
,
boy
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
turned
towards
him
quickly
,
and
with
a
scornful
look
and
flashing
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
tears
in
Mr
Chester
's
eyes
,
but
he
dashed
them
hurriedly
away
,
as
though
unwilling
that
his
weakness
should
be
known
,
and
regarded
her
with
mingled
admiration
and
compassion
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
until
now
,
"
he
said
,
"
believed
,
that
the
frivolous
actions
of
a
young
man
could
move
me
like
these
of
my
own
son
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
knew
till
now
,
the
worth
of
a
woman
's
heart
,
which
boys
so
lightly
win
,
and
lightly
fling
away
.
 
<EOS>
Trust
me
,
dear
young
lady
,
that
I
never
until
now
did
know
your
worth
;
and
though
an
abhorrence
of
deceit
and
falsehood
has
impelled
me
to
seek
you
out
,
and
would
have
done
so
<EOS>
had
you
been
the
poorest
and
least
gifted
of
your
sex
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
lacked
the
fortitude
to
sustain
this
interview
could
I
have
pictured
you
to
my
imagination
as
you
really
are
.
"
  
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
If
Mrs
Varden
could
have
seen
the
virtuous
gentleman
as
he
said
these
words
,
with
indignation
sparkling
from
his
eyes
---
if
she
could
have
heard
his
broken
,
quavering
voice
---
if
she
could
have
beheld
him
as
he
stood
bareheaded
in
the
sunlight
,
and
with
unwonted
energy
poured
forth
his
eloquence
!
  
<EOS>
With
a
haughty
face
,
but
pale
and
trembling
too
,
Emma
regarded
him
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
She
neither
spoke
nor
moved
,
but
gazed
upon
him
as
though
she
would
look
into
his
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
throw
off
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
"
the
restraint
which
natural
affection
would
impose
on
some
men
,
and
reject
all
bonds
but
those
of
truth
and
duty
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Haredale
,
you
are
deceived
;
you
are
deceived
by
your
unworthy
lover
,
and
my
unworthy
son
.
"
  
<EOS>
Still
she
looked
at
him
steadily
,
and
still
said
not
one
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
ever
opposed
his
professions
of
love
for
you
;
you
will
do
me
the
justice
,
dear
Miss
Haredale
,
to
remember
that
.
 
<EOS>
Your
uncle
and
myself
were
enemies
in
early
life
,
and
if
I
had
sought
retaliation
,
I
might
have
found
it
here
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
we
grow
older
,
we
grow
wiser
---
bitter
,
I
would
fain
hope
---
and
from
the
first
,
I
have
opposed
him
in
this
attempt
.
 
<EOS>
I
foresaw
the
end
,
and
would
have
spared
you
,
if
I
could
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Speak
plainly
,
sir
,
"
she
faltered
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
deceive
me
,
or
are
deceived
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
believe
you
---
<EOS>
I
can
not
---
I
should
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
First
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
soothingly
,
"
for
there
may
be
in
your
mind
some
latent
angry
feeling
to
which
I
would
not
appeal
,
pray
take
this
letter
.
 
<EOS>
It
reached
my
hands
by
chance
,
and
by
mistake
,
and
should
have
accounted
to
you
(
as
I
am
told
)
for
my
son
's
not
answering
some
other
note
of
yours
.
 
<EOS>
God
forbid
,
Miss
Haredale
,
"
said
the
good
gentleman
,
with
great
emotion
,
"
that
there
should
be
in
your
gentle
breast
one
causeless
ground
of
quarrel
with
him
.
<EOS>
You
should
know
,
and
you
will
see
,
that
he
was
in
no
fault
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
appeared
something
so
very
candid
,
so
scrupulously
honourable
,
so
very
truthful
and
just
in
this
course
something
which
rendered
the
upright
person
who
resorted
to
it
,
so
worthy
of
belief
---
that
Emma
's
heart
,
for
the
first
time
,
sunk
within
her
.
<EOS>
She
turned
away
and
burst
into
tears
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
leaning
over
her
,
and
speaking
in
mild
and
quite
venerable
accents
;
"
I
would
,
<EOS>
dear
girl
,
it
were
my
task
to
banish
,
not
increase
,
those
tokens
of
your
grief
.
 
<EOS>
My
son
,
my
erring
son
,
---
I
will
not
call
him
deliberately
criminal
in
this
,
for
men
so
young
,
who
have
been
inconstant
twice
or
thrice
before
,
act
without
reflection
,
almost
without
a
knowledge
of
the
wrong
they
do
,
---
will
break
his
plighted
faith
to
you
;
has
broken
it
even
now
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
stop
here
,
and
having
given
you
this
warning
,
leave
it
to
be
fulfilled
;
or
shall
I
go
on
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
go
on
,
sir
,
"
she
answered
,
"
and
speak
more
plainly
yet
,
in
justice
both
to
him
and
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
girl
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
bending
over
her
more
affectionately
still
;
"
whom
I
would
call
my
daughter
,
but
the
Fates
forbid
,
Edward
seeks
to
break
with
you
upon
a
false
and
most
unwarrantable
pretence
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
it
on
his
own
showing
;
in
his
own
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Forgive
me
<EOS>
,
if
I
have
had
a
watch
upon
his
conduct
;
I
am
his
father
;
I
had
a
regard
for
your
peace
and
his
honour
,
and
no
better
resource
was
left
me
.
 
<EOS>
There
lies
on
his
desk
at
this
present
moment
,
ready
for
transmission
to
you
,
a
letter
,
in
which
he
tells
you
that
our
poverty
---
our
poverty
;
his
and
mine
,
Miss
Haredale
---
 
forbids
him
to
pursue
his
claim
upon
your
hand
;
in
which
he
offers
,
voluntarily
proposes
,
to
free
you
from
your
pledge
;
and
talks
magnanimously
(
men
do
so
,
very
commonly
,
in
such
cases
)
of
being
in
time
more
worthy
of
your
regard
---
and
so
forth
.
 
<EOS>
A
letter
,
to
be
plain
,
in
which
he
not
only
jilts
you
<EOS>
---
pardon
the
word
;
I
would
summon
to
your
aid
your
pride
and
dignity
---
<EOS>
not
only
jilts
you
,
I
fear
,
in
favour
of
the
object
whose
slighting
treatment
first
inspired
his
brief
passion
for
yourself
and
gave
it
birth
in
wounded
vanity
,
but
affects
to
make
a
merit
and
a
virtue
of
the
act
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
glanced
proudly
at
him
once
more
,
as
by
an
involuntary
impulse
,
and
with
a
swelling
breast
rejoined
,
"
If
what
you
say
be
true
,
he
takes
much
needless
trouble
,
sir
,
to
compass
his
design
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
very
tender
of
my
peace
of
mind
.
 
<EOS>
I
quite
thank
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
truth
of
what
I
tell
you
,
dear
young
lady
,
"
he
replied
,
"
you
will
test
by
the
receipt
or
non
-
receipt
of
the
letter
of
which
I
speak
.
 
<EOS>
Haredale
,
my
dear
fellow
<EOS>
,
I
am
delighted
to
see
you
,
although
we
meet
under
singular
circumstances
,
and
upon
a
melancholy
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
are
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
At
these
words
the
young
lady
raised
her
eyes
,
which
were
filled
with
tears
;
and
seeing
that
her
uncle
indeed
stood
before
them
,
and
being
quite
unequal
to
the
trial
of
hearing
or
of
speaking
one
word
more
,
hurriedly
withdrew
,
and
left
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
stood
looking
at
each
other
,
and
at
her
retreating
figure
,
and
for
a
long
time
neither
of
them
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
does
this
mean
?
 
<EOS>
Explain
it
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
at
length
.
<EOS>
"
Why
are
you
here
,
and
why
with
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
friend
,
"
rejoined
the
other
,
resuming
his
accustomed
manner
with
infinite
readiness
,
and
throwing
himself
upon
the
bench
with
a
weary
air
,
"
you
told
me
not
very
long
ago
,
at
that
delightful
old
tavern
of
which
you
are
the
esteemed
proprietor
(
and
a
most
charming
establishment
it
is
for
persons
of
rural
pursuits
and
in
robust
health
,
who
are
not
liable
to
take
cold
)
,
that
I
had
the
head
and
heart
of
an
evil
spirit
in
all
matters
of
deception
.
<EOS>
I
thought
at
the
time
;
I
really
did
think
;
you
flattered
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
now
I
begin
to
wonder
at
your
discernment
,
and
<EOS>
vanity
apart
,
do
honestly
believe
you
spoke
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
counterfeit
extreme
ingenuousness
and
honest
indignation
?
 
<EOS>
My
dear
fellow
,
you
have
no
conception
,
if
you
never
did
,
how
faint
the
effort
makes
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
surveyed
him
with
a
look
of
cold
contempt
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
evade
an
explanation
,
I
know
,
"
he
said
,
folding
his
arms
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
must
have
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
wait
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
Not
at
all
,
my
good
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
not
wait
a
moment
,
"
returned
his
friend
,
as
he
lazily
crossed
his
legs
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
simplest
thing
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
It
lies
in
a
nutshell
.
 
<EOS>
Ned
has
written
her
a
letter
---
a
boyish
,
honest
,
sentimental
composition
,
which
remains
as
yet
in
his
desk
,
because
he
has
n't
had
the
heart
to
send
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
taken
a
liberty
,
for
which
my
parental
affection
and
anxiety
are
a
sufficient
excuse
,
and
possessed
myself
of
the
contents
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
described
them
to
your
niece
(
a
most
enchanting
person
,
Haredale
;
quite
an
angelic
creature
)
,
with
a
little
colouring
and
description
adapted
to
our
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
done
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
be
quite
easy
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
all
over
.
 
<EOS>
Deprived
of
their
adherents
and
mediators
;
her
pride
and
jealousy
roused
to
the
utmost
;
with
nobody
to
undeceive
her
,
and
you
to
confirm
me
;
you
will
find
that
their
intercourse
will
close
with
her
answer
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
receives
Ned
's
letter
by
to
-
morrow
noon
,
you
may
date
their
parting
from
to
-
morrow
night
.
 
<EOS>
No
thanks
<EOS>
,
I
beg
;
you
owe
me
none
.
<EOS>
I
have
acted
for
myself
;
and
if
I
have
forwarded
our
compact
with
all
the
ardour
even
you
could
have
desired
,
I
have
done
so
selfishly
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
curse
the
compact
,
as
you
call
it
,
with
my
whole
heart
and
soul
,
"
returned
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
made
in
an
evil
hour
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
bound
myself
to
a
lie
;
I
have
leagued
myself
with
you
;
and
though
I
did
so
with
a
righteous
motive
,
and
though
it
cost
me
such
an
effort
as
haply
few
men
know
,
I
hate
and
despise
myself
for
the
deed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
warm
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
with
a
languid
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
AM
warm
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
maddened
by
your
coldness
.
 
<EOS>
"
Death
,
Chester
,
if
your
blood
ran
warmer
in
your
veins
,
and
there
were
no
restraints
upon
me
,
such
as
those
that
hold
and
drag
me
back
---
<EOS>
well
;
it
is
done
;
you
tell
me
so
,
and
on
such
a
point
I
may
believe
you
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
am
most
remorseful
for
this
treachery
,
I
will
think
of
you
and
your
marriage
,
and
try
to
justify
myself
in
such
remembrances
,
for
having
torn
asunder
Emma
and
your
son
,
at
any
cost
.
 
<EOS>
Our
bond
is
cancelled
now
,
and
we
may
part
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Chester
kissed
his
hand
gracefully
;
and
with
the
same
tranquil
face
he
had
preserved
throughout
---
even
when
he
had
seen
his
companion
so
tortured
and
transported
by
his
passion
that
his
whole
frame
was
shaken
---
lay
in
his
lounging
posture
on
the
seat
and
watched
him
as
he
walked
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
scapegoat
and
my
drudge
at
school
,
"
he
said
,
raising
his
head
to
look
after
him
;
"
my
friend
of
later
days
,
who
could
not
keep
his
mistress
when
he
had
won
her
,
and
threw
me
in
her
way
to
carry
off
the
prize
;
I
triumph
in
the
present
and
the
past
.
 
<EOS>
Bark
on
,
ill
-
favoured
,
ill
-
conditioned
cur
<EOS>
;
fortune
has
ever
been
with
me
---
I
like
to
hear
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
spot
where
they
had
met
,
was
in
an
avenue
of
trees
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
not
passing
out
on
either
hand
,
had
walked
straight
on
.
<EOS>
He
chanced
to
turn
his
head
when
at
some
considerable
distance
,
and
seeing
that
his
late
companion
had
by
that
time
risen
and
was
looking
after
him
,
stood
still
as
though
he
half
expected
him
to
follow
and
waited
for
his
coming
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
MAY
come
to
that
one
day
,
but
not
yet
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
waving
his
hand
,
as
though
they
were
the
best
of
friends
,
and
turning
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
yet
,
Haredale
.
 
<EOS>
Life
is
pleasant
enough
to
me
;
dull
and
full
of
heaviness
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
To
cross
swords
with
such
a
man
---
to
indulge
his
humour
unless
upon
extremity
---
would
be
weak
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
For
all
that
,
he
drew
his
sword
as
he
walked
along
,
and
in
an
absent
humour
ran
his
eye
from
hilt
to
point
full
twenty
times
.
<EOS>
But
thoughtfulness
begets
wrinkles
;
remembering
this
,
he
soon
put
it
up
,
smoothed
his
contracted
brow
,
hummed
a
gay
tune
with
greater
gaiety
of
manner
,
and
was
his
unruffled
self
again
.

Chapter
30
    
A
homely
proverb
recognises
the
existence
of
a
troublesome
class
of
persons
who
,
having
an
inch
conceded
them
,
will
take
an
ell
.
 
<EOS>
Not
to
quote
the
illustrious
examples
of
those
heroic
scourges
of
mankind
,
whose
amiable
path
in
life
has
been
from
birth
to
death
through
blood
,
and
fire
,
and
ruin
,
and
who
would
seem
to
have
existed
for
no
better
purpose
than
to
teach
mankind
that
as
the
absence
of
pain
is
pleasure
,
so
the
earth
,
purged
of
their
presence
,
may
be
deemed
a
blessed
place
---
not
to
quote
such
mighty
instances
,
it
will
be
sufficient
to
refer
to
old
John
Willet
.
  
<EOS>
Old
John
having
long
encroached
a
good
standard
inch
,
full
measure
,
on
the
liberty
of
Joe
,
and
having
snipped
off
a
Flemish
ell
in
the
matter
of
the
parole
,
grew
so
despotic
and
so
great
,
that
his
thirst
for
conquest
knew
no
bounds
.
 
<EOS>
The
more
young
Joe
submitted
,
the
more
absolute
old
John
became
.
 
<EOS>
The
ell
soon
faded
into
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Yards
,
furlongs
,
miles
arose
;
and
on
went
old
John
in
the
pleasantest
manner
possible
,
trimming
off
an
exuberance
in
this
place
,
shearing
away
some
liberty
of
speech
or
action
in
that
,
and
conducting
himself
in
his
small
way
with
as
much
high
mightiness
and
majesty
,
as
the
most
glorious
tyrant
that
ever
had
his
statue
reared
in
the
public
ways
,
of
ancient
or
of
modern
times
.
  
<EOS>
As
great
men
are
urged
on
to
the
abuse
of
power
(
when
they
need
urging
,
which
is
not
often
)
,
by
their
flatterers
and
dependents
,
so
old
John
was
impelled
to
these
exercises
of
authority
by
the
applause
and
admiration
of
his
Maypole
cronies
,
who
,
in
the
intervals
of
their
nightly
pipes
and
pots
,
would
shake
their
heads
and
say
that
Mr
Willet
was
a
father
of
the
good
old
English
sort
;
that
there
were
no
new
-
fangled
notions
or
modern
ways
in
him
;
that
he
put
them
in
mind
of
what
their
fathers
were
when
they
were
boys
;
that
there
was
no
mistake
about
him
;
that
it
would
be
well
for
the
country
if
there
were
more
like
him
,
and
more
was
the
pity
that
there
were
not
;
with
many
other
original
remarks
of
that
nature
.
<EOS>
Then
they
would
condescendingly
give
Joe
to
understand
that
it
was
all
for
his
good
,
and
he
would
be
thankful
for
it
one
day
;
and
in
particular
,
Mr
Cobb
would
acquaint
him
,
that
when
he
was
his
age
,
his
father
thought
no
more
of
giving
him
a
parental
kick
,
or
a
box
on
the
ears
,
or
a
cuff
on
the
head
,
or
some
little
admonition
of
that
sort
,
than
he
did
of
any
other
ordinary
duty
of
life
;
and
he
would
further
remark
,
with
looks
of
great
significance
,
that
but
for
this
judicious
bringing
up
,
he
might
have
never
been
the
man
he
was
at
that
present
speaking
;
which
was
probable
enough
,
as
he
was
,
beyond
all
question
,
the
dullest
dog
of
the
party
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
between
old
John
and
old
John
's
friends
,
there
never
was
an
unfortunate
young
fellow
so
bullied
,
badgered
,
worried
,
fretted
,
and
brow
-
beaten
;
so
constantly
beset
,
or
made
so
tired
of
his
life
,
as
poor
Joe
Willet
.
  
<EOS>
This
had
come
to
be
the
recognised
and
established
state
of
things
;
but
as
John
was
very
anxious
to
flourish
his
supremacy
before
the
eyes
of
Mr
Chester
,
he
did
that
day
exceed
himself
,
and
did
so
goad
and
chafe
his
son
and
heir
,
that
but
for
Joe
's
having
made
a
solemn
vow
to
keep
his
hands
in
his
pockets
when
they
were
not
otherwise
engaged
,
it
is
impossible
to
say
what
he
might
have
done
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
longest
day
has
an
end
,
and
at
length
Mr
Chester
came
downstairs
to
mount
his
horse
,
which
was
ready
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
As
old
John
was
not
in
the
way
at
the
moment
,
Joe
,
who
was
sitting
in
the
bar
ruminating
on
his
dismal
fate
and
the
manifold
perfections
of
Dolly
Varden
,
ran
out
to
hold
the
guest
's
stirrup
and
assist
him
to
mount
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Chester
was
scarcely
in
the
saddle
,
and
Joe
was
in
the
very
act
of
making
him
a
graceful
bow
,
when
old
John
came
diving
out
of
the
porch
,
and
collared
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
None
of
that
,
sir
,
"
said
John
,
"
none
of
that
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
No
breaking
of
patroles
.
 
<EOS>
How
dare
you
come
out
of
the
door
,
sir
,
without
leave
?
<EOS>
You
're
trying
to
get
away
,
sir
,
are
you
,
and
to
make
a
traitor
of
yourself
again
?
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
go
,
father
,
"
said
Joe
,
imploringly
,
as
he
marked
the
smile
upon
their
visitor
's
face
,
and
observed
the
pleasure
his
disgrace
afforded
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
too
bad
.
 
<EOS>
Who
wants
to
get
away
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
wants
to
get
away
!
"
<EOS>
cried
John
,
shaking
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
you
do
,
sir
,
you
do
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
the
boy
,
sir
,
"
added
John
,
collaring
with
one
band
,
and
aiding
the
effect
of
a
farewell
bow
to
the
visitor
with
the
other
,
"
that
wants
to
sneak
into
houses
,
and
stir
up
differences
between
noble
gentlemen
and
their
sons
<EOS>
,
are
you
,
eh
?
<EOS>
Hold
your
tongue
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Joe
made
no
effort
to
reply
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
crowning
circumstance
of
his
degradation
.
 
<EOS>
He
extricated
himself
from
his
father
's
grasp
,
darted
an
angry
look
at
the
departing
guest
,
and
returned
into
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
for
her
,
"
thought
Joe
,
as
he
threw
his
arms
upon
a
table
in
the
common
room
,
and
laid
his
head
upon
them
,
"
but
for
Dolly
,
who
I
could
n't
bear
should
think
me
the
rascal
<EOS>
they
would
make
me
out
to
be
if
I
ran
away
,
this
house
and
I
should
part
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
being
evening
by
this
time
,
Solomon
Daisy
,
Tom
Cobb
,
and
Long
Parkes
,
were
all
in
the
common
room
too
,
and
had
from
the
window
been
witnesses
of
what
had
just
occurred
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Willet
joining
them
soon
afterwards
,
received
the
compliments
of
the
company
with
great
composure
,
and
lighting
his
pipe
,
sat
down
among
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
'll
see
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
<EOS>
John
,
after
a
long
pause
,
"
who
's
the
master
of
this
house
,
and
who
is
n't
.
 
<EOS>
We
'll
see
whether
boys
are
to
govern
men
,
or
men

<EOS>
"
  
"
And
quite
right
too
,
"
assented
Solomon
Daisy
with
some
approving
nods
;
"
quite
right
,
Johnny
.
 
<EOS>
Very
good
,
Johnny
.
 
<EOS>
Well
said
,
Mr
Willet
.
 
<EOS>
Brayvo
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
John
slowly
brought
his
eyes
to
bear
upon
him
,
looked
at
him
for
a
long
time
,
and
finally
made
answer
,
to
the
unspeakable
consternation
of
his
hearers
,
"
When
I
want
encouragement
from
you
,
sir
,
I
'll
ask
you
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
let
me
alone
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
get
on
without
you
,
I
hope
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
tackle
me
,
sir
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
take
it
ill
,
Johnny
;
I
did
n't
mean
any
harm
,
"
pleaded
the
little
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
sir
,
"
said
John
,
more
than
usually
obstinate
after
his
late
success
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
stand
pretty
firm
of
myself
,
sir
,
I
believe
,
without
being
shored
up
by
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
having
given
utterance
to
this
retort
,
Mr
Willet
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
boiler
,
and
fell
into
a
kind
of
tobacco
-
trance
.
  
<EOS>
The
spirits
of
the
company
being
somewhat
damped
by
this
embarrassing
line
of
conduct
on
the
part
of
their
host
,
nothing
more
was
said
for
a
long
time
;
but
at
length
Mr
Cobb
took
upon
himself
to
remark
,
as
he
rose
to
knock
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
,
that
he
hoped
Joe
would
thenceforth
learn
to
obey
his
father
in
all
things
;
that
he
had
found
,
that
day
,
he
was
not
one
of
the
sort
of
men
who
were
to
be
trifled
with
;
and
that
he
would
recommend
him
,
poetically
speaking
,
to
mind
his
eye
for
the
future
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'd
recommend
you
,
in
return
,
"
said
Joe
,
looking
up
with
a
flushed
face
,
"
not
to
talk
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hold
your
tongue
,
sir
,
"
cried
Mr
Willet
,
suddenly
rousing
himself
,
and
turning
round
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
,
father
,
"
cried
Joe
,
smiting
the
table
with
his
fist
,
so
that
the
jugs
and
glasses
rung
again
;
"
these
things
are
hard
enough
to
bear
from
you
;
from
anybody
else
I
never
will
endure
them
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
I
say
,
Mr
Cobb
,
do
n't
talk
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
who
are
you
,
"
said
Mr
Cobb
,
sneeringly
,
"
that
you
're
not
to
be
talked
to
,
eh
,
Joe
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
To
which
Joe
returned
no
answer
,
but
with
a
very
ominous
shake
of
the
head
,
resumed
his
old
position
,
which
he
would
have
peacefully
preserved
until
the
house
shut
up
at
night
,
but
that
Mr
Cobb
,
stimulated
by
the
wonder
of
the
company
at
the
young
man
's
presumption
,
retorted
with
sundry
taunts
,
which
proved
too
much
for
flesh
and
blood
to
bear
.
 
<EOS>
Crowding
into
one
moment
the
vexation
and
the
wrath
of
years
,
Joe
started
up
,
overturned
the
table
,
<EOS>
fell
upon
his
long
enemy
,
pummelled
him
with
all
his
might
and
main
,
and
finished
by
driving
him
with
surprising
swiftness
against
a
heap
of
spittoons
in
one
corner
;
plunging
into
which
,
head
foremost
,
with
a
tremendous
crash
,
he
lay
at
full
length
among
the
ruins
,
stunned
and
motionless
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
without
waiting
to
receive
the
compliments
of
the
bystanders
on
the
victory
be
had
won
,
he
retreated
to
his
own
bedchamber
,
and
considering
himself
in
a
state
of
siege
,
piled
all
the
portable
furniture
against
the
door
by
way
of
barricade
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
done
it
now
,
"
said
Joe
,
as
he
sat
down
upon
his
bedstead
and
wiped
his
heated
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
knew
it
would
come
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
The
Maypole
and
I
must
part
company
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
a
roving
vagabond
---
she
hates
me
for
evermore
---
it
's
all
over
!
"
    
<EOS>
Chapter
31
    
Pondering
on
his
unhappy
lot
,
Joe
sat
and
listened
for
a
long
time
,
expecting
every
moment
to
hear
their
creaking
footsteps
on
the
stairs
,
or
to
be
greeted
by
his
worthy
father
with
a
summons
to
capitulate
unconditionally
,
and
deliver
himself
up
straightway
.
<EOS>
But
neither
voice
nor
footstep
came
;
and
though
some
distant
echoes
,
as
of
closing
doors
and
people
hurrying
in
and
out
of
rooms
,
resounding
from
time
to
time
through
the
great
passages
,
and
penetrating
to
his
remote
seclusion
,
gave
note
of
unusual
commotion
downstairs
,
no
nearer
sound
disturbed
his
place
of
retreat
,
which
seemed
the
quieter
for
these
far
-
off
noises
,
and
was
as
dull
and
full
of
gloom
as
any
hermit
's
cell
.
  
<EOS>
It
came
on
darker
and
darker
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
-
fashioned
furniture
of
the
chamber
,
which
was
a
kind
of
hospital
for
all
the
invalided
movables
in
the
house
,
grew
indistinct
and
shadowy
in
its
many
shapes
;
chairs
and
tables
,
which
by
day
were
as
honest
cripples
as
need
be
,
assumed
a
doubtful
and
mysterious
character
;
and
one
old
leprous
screen
of
faded
India
leather
and
gold
binding
,
which
had
kept
out
many
a
cold
breath
of
air
in
days
of
yore
and
shut
in
many
a
jolly
face
,
frowned
on
him
with
a
spectral
aspect
,
and
stood
at
full
height
in
its
allotted
corner
,
like
some
gaunt
ghost
who
waited
to
be
questioned
.
 
<EOS>
A
portrait
opposite
the
window
---
a
queer
,
old
grey
-
eyed
general
,
in
an
oval
frame
---
seemed
to
wink
and
doze
as
the
light
decayed
,
and
at
length
,
when
the
last
faint
glimmering
speck
of
day
went
out
,
to
shut
its
eyes
in
good
earnest
,
and
fall
sound
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
such
a
hush
and
mystery
about
everything
,
that
Joe
could
not
help
following
its
example
;
and
so
went
off
into
a
slumber
likewise
,
and
dreamed
of
Dolly
,
till
the
clock
of
Chigwell
church
struck
two
.
  
<EOS>
Still
nobody
came
.
 
<EOS>
The
distant
noises
in
the
house
had
ceased
,
and
out
of
doors
<EOS>
all
was
quiet
;
save
for
the
occasional
barking
of
some
deep
-
mouthed
dog
,
and
the
shaking
of
the
branches
by
the
night
wind
.
 
<EOS>
He
gazed
mournfully
out
of
window
at
each
well
-
known
object
as
it
lay
sleeping
in
the
dim
light
of
the
moon
;
and
creeping
back
to
his
former
seat
,
thought
about
the
late
uproar
,
until
,
with
long
thinking
of
<EOS>
,
it
seemed
to
have
occurred
a
month
ago
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
between
dozing
,
and
thinking
,
and
walking
to
the
window
and
looking
out
,
the
night
wore
away
;
the
grim
old
screen
,
and
the
kindred
chairs
and
tables
,
began
slowly
to
reveal
themselves
in
their
accustomed
forms
;
the
grey
-
eyed
general
seemed
to
wink
and
yawn
and
rouse
himself
;
and
at
last
he
was
broad
awake
again
,
and
very
uncomfortable
and
cold
and
haggard
he
looked
,
in
the
dull
grey
light
of
morning
.
  
<EOS>
The
sun
had
begun
to
peep
above
the
forest
trees
,
and
already
flung
across
the
curling
mist
bright
bars
of
gold
,
when
Joe
dropped
from
his
window
on
the
ground
below
,
a
little
bundle
and
his
trusty
stick
,
and
prepared
to
descend
himself
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
a
very
difficult
task
;
for
there
were
so
many
projections
and
gable
ends
in
the
way
,
that
they
formed
a
series
of
clumsy
steps
,
with
no
greater
obstacle
than
a
jump
of
some
few
feet
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
Joe
,
with
his
stick
and
bundle
on
his
shoulder
,
quickly
stood
on
the
firm
earth
,
and
looked
up
at
the
old
Maypole
,
it
might
be
for
the
last
time
.
  
<EOS>
He
did
n't
apostrophise
it
,
for
he
was
no
great
scholar
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
n't
curse
it
,
for
he
had
little
ill
-
will
to
give
to
anything
on
earth
.
<EOS>
He
felt
more
affectionate
and
kind
to
it
than
ever
he
had
done
in
all
his
life
before
,
so
said
with
all
his
heart
,
"
God
bless
you
!
"
<EOS>
as
a
parting
wish
,
and
turned
away
.
  
<EOS>
He
walked
along
at
a
brisk
pace
,
big
with
great
thoughts
of
going
for
a
soldier
and
dying
in
some
foreign
country
where
it
was
very
hot
and
sandy
,
and
leaving
God
knows
what
unheard
-
of
wealth
in
prize
-
money
to
Dolly
,
who
would
be
very
much
affected
when
she
came
to
know
of
it
;
and
full
of
such
youthful
visions
,
which
were
sometimes
sanguine
and
sometimes
melancholy
,
but
always
had
her
for
their
main
point
and
centre
,
pushed
on
vigorously
until
the
noise
of
London
sounded
in
his
ears
,
and
the
Black
Lion
hove
in
sight
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
only
eight
o'clock
then
,
and
very
much
astonished
the
Black
Lion
was
,
to
see
him
come
walking
in
with
dust
upon
his
feet
at
that
early
hour
,
with
no
grey
mare
to
bear
him
company
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
he
ordered
breakfast
to
be
got
ready
with
all
speed
,
and
on
its
being
set
before
him
gave
indisputable
tokens
of
a
hearty
appetite
,
the
Lion
received
him
,
as
usual
,
with
a
hospitable
welcome
;
and
treated
him
with
those
marks
of
distinction
,
which
,
as
a
regular
customer
,
and
one
within
the
freemasonry
of
the
trade
,
he
had
a
right
to
claim
.
  
<EOS>
This
Lion
or
landlord
,
---
for
he
was
called
both
man
and
beast
,
by
reason
of
his
having
instructed
the
artist
who
painted
his
sign
,
to
convey
into
the
features
of
the
lordly
brute
whose
effigy
it
bore
,
as
near
a
counterpart
of
his
own
face
as
his
skill
could
compass
and
devise
,
---
was
a
gentleman
almost
as
quick
of
apprehension
,
and
of
almost
as
subtle
a
wit
,
as
the
mighty
John
himself
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
difference
between
them
lay
in
this
:
that
whereas
Mr
Willet
's
extreme
sagacity
and
acuteness
were
the
efforts
of
unassisted
nature
<EOS>
,
the
Lion
stood
indebted
,
in
no
small
amount
,
to
beer
;
of
which
he
swigged
such
copious
draughts
,
that
most
of
his
faculties
were
utterly
drowned
and
washed
away
,
except
the
one
great
faculty
of
sleep
,
which
he
retained
in
surprising
perfection
.
 
<EOS>
The
creaking
Lion
over
the
house
-
door
was
,
therefore
,
to
say
the
truth
,
rather
a
drowsy
,
tame
,
and
feeble
lion
;
and
as
these
social
representatives
of
a
savage
class
are
usually
of
a
conventional
character
(
being
depicted
,
for
the
most
part
,
in
impossible
attitudes
and
of
unearthly
colours
)
,
he
was
frequently
supposed
by
the
more
ignorant
and
uninformed
among
the
neighbours
,
to
be
the
veritable
portrait
of
the
host
as
he
appeared
on
the
occasion
of
some
great
funeral
ceremony
or
public
mourning
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
noisy
fellow
is
that
in
the
next
room
?
"
said
Joe
,
when
he
had
disposed
of
his
breakfast
,
and
had
washed
and
brushed
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
recruiting
serjeant
,
"
replied
the
Lion
.
  
<EOS>
Joe
started
involuntarily
.
 
<EOS>
Here
was
the
very
thing
he
had
been
dreaming
of
,
all
the
way
along
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
wish
,
"
said
the
Lion
,
"
he
was
anywhere
else
but
here
.
 
<EOS>
The
party
make
noise
enough
,
but
do
n't
call
for
much
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
great
cry
there
,
Mr
Willet
,
but
very
little
wool
.
 
<EOS>
Your
father
would
n't
like
'em
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
not
much
under
any
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
if
he
could
have
known
what
was
passing
at
that
moment
in
Joe
's
mind
,
he
would
have
liked
them
still
less
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
he
recruiting
for
a
---
for
a
fine
regiment
?
"
said
Joe
,
glancing
at
a
little
round
mirror
that
hung
in
the
bar
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
he
is
,
"
replied
the
host
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
much
the
same
thing
,
whatever
regiment
he
's
recruiting
for
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
told
there
an't
<EOS>
a
deal
of
difference
between
a
fine
man
and
another
one
,
when
they
're
shot
through
and
through
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
're
not
all
shot
,
"
said
Joe
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
the
Lion
answered
,
"
not
all
.
 
<EOS>
Those
that
are
---
supposing
it
's
done
easy
---
are
the
best
off
in
my
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ah
!
"
retorted
Joe
,
"
but
you
do
n't
care
for
glory
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
what
?
"
said
the
Lion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Glory
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
returned
the
Lion
,
with
supreme
indifference
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
.
<EOS>
You
're
right
in
that
,
Mr
Willet
.
 
<EOS>
When
Glory
comes
here
,
and
calls
for
anything
to
drink
and
changes
a
guinea
to
pay
for
it
,
I
'll
give
it
him
for
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
my
belief
,
sir
,
that
the
Glory
's
arms
would
n't
do
a
very
strong
business
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
These
remarks
were
not
at
all
comforting
.
 
<EOS>
Joe
walked
out
,
stopped
at
the
door
of
the
next
room
,
and
listened
.
 
<EOS>
The
serjeant
was
describing
a
military
life
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
all
drinking
,
he
said
,
except
that
there
were
frequent
intervals
of
eating
and
love
-
making
.
 
<EOS>
A
battle
was
the
finest
thing
in
the
world
---
when
your
side
won
it
---
 
and
Englishmen
always
did
that
.
 
<EOS>
"
Supposing
you
should
be
killed
,
sir
?
"
said
a
timid
voice
in
one
corner
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
supposing
you
should
be
,
"
said
the
serjeant
,
"
<EOS>
what
then
?
 
<EOS>
Your
country
loves
you
,
sir
;
his
Majesty
King
George
the
Third
loves
you
;
your
memory
is
honoured
,
revered
,
respected
;
everybody
's
fond
of
you
,
and
grateful
to
you
;
your
name
's
wrote
down
at
full
length
in

book
in
the
War
Office
.
 
<EOS>
Damme
,
gentlemen
<EOS>
,
we
must
all
die
some
time
,
or
another
,
eh
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
voice
coughed
,
and
said
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
Joe
walked
into
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
A
group
of
half
-
a
-
dozen
fellows
had
gathered
together
in
the
taproom
,
and
were
listening
with
greedy
ears
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
them
,
a
carter
in
a
smockfrock
,
seemed
wavering
and
disposed
to
enlist
.
 
<EOS>
The
rest
,
who
were
by
no
means
disposed
,
strongly
urged
him
to
do
so
<EOS>
(
according
to
the
custom
of
mankind
)
,
backed
the
serjeant
's
arguments
,
and
grinned
among
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
say
nothing
,
boys
,
"
said
the
serjeant
,
who
sat
a
little
apart
,
drinking
his
liquor
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
lads
of
spirit
"
---
here
he
cast
an
eye
on
Joe
---
"
this
is
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
to
inveigle
you
.
 
<EOS>
The
king
's
not
come
to
that
,
I
hope
.
 
<EOS>
Brisk
young
blood
is
what
we
want
;
not
milk
and
water
.
 
<EOS>
We
wo
n't
take
five
men
out
of
six
.
 
<EOS>
We
want
top
-
sawyers
,
we
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
not
a
-
going
to
tell
tales
out
of
school
,
but
,
damme
,
if
every
gentleman
's
son
that
carries
arms
in
our
corps
,
through
being
under
a
cloud
and
having
little
differences
with
his
relations
,
was
counted
up
"
---
<EOS>
here
his
eye
fell
on
Joe
again
,
and
so
good
-
naturedly
,
that
Joe
beckoned
him
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
came
directly
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
gentleman
,
by
G
---
 
!
<EOS>
"
was
his
first
remark
,
as
he
slapped
him
on
the
back
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
gentleman
in
disguise
.
 
<EOS>
So
am
I.
 
<EOS>
Let
's
swear
a
friendship
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Joe
did
n't
exactly
do
that
,
but
he
shook
hands
with
him
,
and
thanked
him
for
his
good
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
want
to
serve
,
"
said
his
new
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
made
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
one
of
us
by
nature
.
 
<EOS>
What
'll
you
take
to
drink
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
just
now
,
"
replied
Joe
,
smiling
faintly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
quite
made
up
my
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
mettlesome
fellow
like
you
,
and
not
made
up
his
mind
!
"
cried
the
serjeant
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
---
let
me
give
the
bell
a
pull
,
and
you
'll
make
up
your
mind
in
half
a
minute
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
right
so
far
"
---
answered
Joe
,
"
for
if
you
pull
the
bell
here
,
where
I
'm
known
,
there
'll
be
an
end
of
my
soldiering
inclinations
in
no
time
.
 
<EOS>
Look
in
my
face
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
me
,
do
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
replied
the
serjeant
with
an
oath
,
"
and
a
finer
young
fellow
or
one
better
qualified
to
serve
his
king
and
country
<EOS>
,
I
never
set
my
---
"
he
used
an
adjective
in
this
place
---
"
eyes
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
said
Joe
,
"
I
did
n't
ask
you
for
want
of
a
compliment
,
but
thank
you
all
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
Do
I
look
like
a
sneaking
fellow
or
a
liar
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
serjeant
rejoined
with
many
choice
asseverations
that
he
did
n't
;
and
that
if
his
(
the
serjeant
's
)
own
father
were
to
say
he
did
,
he
would
run
the
old
gentleman
through
the
body
cheerfully
,
and
consider
it
a
meritorious
action
.
  
<EOS>
Joe
expressed
his
obligations
,
and
continued
,
"
You
can
trust
me
then
,
and
credit
what
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
shall
enlist
in
your
regiment
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
The
reason
I
do
n't
do
so
now
is
,
because
I
do
n't
want
until
to
-
night
,
to
do
what
I
ca
n't
recall
.
 
<EOS>
Where
shall
I
find
you
,
this
evening
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
His
friend
replied
with
some
unwillingness
,
and
after
much
ineffectual
entreaty
having
for
its
object
the
immediate
settlement
of
the
business
,
that
his
quarters
would
be
at
the
Crooked
Billet
in
Tower
Street
;
where
he
would
be
found
waking
until
midnight
,
and
sleeping
until
breakfast
time
to
-
morrow
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
if
I
do
come
---
which
it
's
a
million
to
one
,
I
shall
---
when
will
you
take
me
out
of
London
?
"
demanded
Joe
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
-
morrow
morning
,
at
half
after
eight
o'clock
,
"
replied
the
serjeant
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
'll
go
abroad
---
a
country
where
it
's
all
sunshine
and
plunder
---
the
finest
climate
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
go
abroad
,
"
said
Joe
,
shaking
hands
with
him
,
"
is
the
very
thing
I
want
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
expect
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
the
kind
of
lad
for
us
,
"
cried
the
serjeant
,
holding
Joe
's
hand
in
his
,
in
the
excess
of
his
admiration
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
the
boy
to
push
your
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
say
it
because
I
bear
you
any
envy
,
or
would
take
away
from
the
credit
of
the
rise
you
'll
make
,
but
if
I
had
been
bred
and
taught
like
you
,
I
'd
have
been
a
colonel
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tush
,
man
!
"
said
Joe
,
"
I
'm
not
so
young
as
that
.
 
<EOS>
Needs
must
when
the
devil
drives
;
and
the
devil
that
drives
me
is
an
empty
pocket
and
an
unhappy
home
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
present
,
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
For
king
and
country
!
"
cried
the
serjeant
,
flourishing
his
cap
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
bread
and
meat
!
"
cried
Joe
,
snapping
his
fingers
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
they
parted
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
very
little
money
in
his
pocket
;
so
little
indeed
,
that
after
paying
for
his
breakfast
(
which
he
was
too
honest
and
perhaps
too
proud
to
score
up
to
his
father
's
charge
)
he
had
but
a
penny
left
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
courage
,
notwithstanding
,
to
resist
all
the
affectionate
importunities
of
the
serjeant
,
who
waylaid
him
at
the
door
with
many
protestations
of
eternal
friendship
,
and
did
in
particular
request
that
he
would
do
him
the
favour
to
accept
of
only
one
shilling
as
a
temporary
accommodation
.
 
<EOS>
Rejecting
his
offers
both
of
cash
and
credit
,
Joe
walked
away
with
stick
and
bundle
as
before
,
bent
upon
getting
through
the
day
as
he
best
could
,
and
going
down
to
the
locksmith
's
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
;
for
it
should
go
hard
,
he
had
resolved
,
but
he
would
have
a
parting
word
with
charming
Dolly
Varden
.
  
<EOS>
He
went
out
by
Islington
and
so
on
to
Highgate
,
and
sat
on
many
stones
and
gates
,
but
there
were
no
voices
in
the
bells
to
bid
him
turn
.
 
<EOS>
Since
the
time
of
noble
Whittington
,
fair
flower
of
merchants
,
bells
have
come
to
have
less
sympathy
with
humankind
.
<EOS>
They
only
ring
for
money
and
on
state
occasions
.
 
<EOS>
Wanderers
have
increased
in
number
;
ships
leave
the
Thames
for
distant
regions
,
carrying
from
stem
to
stern
no
other
cargo
;
the
bells
are
silent
;
they
ring
out
no
entreaties
or
regrets
;
they
are
used
to
it
and
have
grown
worldly
.
  
<EOS>
Joe
bought
a
roll
,
and
reduced
his
purse
to
the
condition
(
with
a
difference
)
of
that
celebrated
purse
of
Fortunatus
,
which
,
whatever
were
its
favoured
owner
's
necessities
,
had
one
unvarying
amount
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
In
these
real
times
,
when
all
the
Fairies
are
dead
and
buried
,
there
are
still
a
great
many
purses
which
possess
that
quality
.
 
<EOS>
The
sum
-
total
they
contain
is
expressed
in
arithmetic
by
a
circle
,
and
whether
it
be
added
to
or
multiplied
by
its
own
amount
,
the
result
of
the
problem
is
more
easily
stated
than
any
known
in
figures
.
  
<EOS>
Evening
drew
on
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
With
the
desolate
and
solitary
feeling
of
one
who
had
no
home
or
shelter
,
and
was
alone
utterly
in
the
world
for
the
first
time
,
he
bent
his
steps
towards
the
locksmith
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
delayed
till
now
,
knowing
that
Mrs
Varden
sometimes
went
out
alone
,
or
with
Miggs
for
her
sole
attendant
,
to
lectures
in
the
evening
;
and
devoutly
hoping
that
this
might
be
one
of
her
nights
of
moral
culture
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
walked
up
and
down
before
the
house
,
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
,
two
or
three
times
,
when
as
he
returned
to
it
again
,
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
fluttering
skirt
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
Dolly
's
---
to
whom
else
could
it
belong
?
<EOS>
no
dress
but
hers
had
such
a
flow
as
that
.
 
<EOS>
He
plucked
up
his
spirits
,
and
followed
it
into
the
workshop
of
the
Golden
Key
.
  
<EOS>
His
darkening
the
door
caused
her
to
look
round
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
that
face
!
<EOS>
"
If
it
had
n't
been
for
that
,
"
thought
Joe
,
"
I
should
never
have
walked
into
poor
Tom
Cobb
.
 
<EOS>
She
's
twenty
times
handsomer
than
ever
.
<EOS>
She
might
marry
a
Lord
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
did
n't
say
this
.
 
<EOS>
He
only
thought
it
---
perhaps
looked
it
also
.
<EOS>
Dolly
was
glad
to
see
him
,
and
was
SO
sorry
her
father
and
mother
were
away
from
home
.
 
<EOS>
Joe
begged
she
would
n't
mention
it
on
any
account
.
  
<EOS>
Dolly
hesitated
to
lead
the
way
into
the
parlour
,
for
there
it
was
nearly
dark
;
at
the
same
time
she
hesitated
to
stand
talking
in
the
workshop
,
which
was
yet
light
and
open
to
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
got
by
some
means
,
too
,
before
the
little
forge
;
and
Joe
having
her
hand
in
his
(
which
he
had
no
right
to
have
,
<EOS>
for
Dolly
only
gave
it
him
to
shake
)
,
it
was
so
like
standing
before
some
homely
altar
being
married
,
that
it
was
the
most
embarrassing
state
of
things
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
,
"
said
Joe
,
"
to
say
good
-
bye
<EOS>
---
to
say
<EOS>
good
-
bye
<EOS>
for
I
do
n't
know
how
many
years
;
perhaps
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
abroad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Now
this
was
exactly
what
he
should
not
have
said
.
 
<EOS>
Here
he
was
,
talking
like
a
gentleman
at
large
who
was
free
to
come
and
go
and
roam
about
the
world
at
pleasure
,
when
that
gallant
coachmaker
had
vowed
but
<EOS>
the
night
before
that
Miss
Varden
held
him
bound
in
adamantine
chains
;
and
had
positively
stated
in
so
many
words
that
she
was
killing
him
by
inches
,
and
that
in
a
fortnight
more
or
thereabouts
he
expected
to
make
a
decent
end
and
leave
the
business
to
his
mother
.
  
<EOS>
Dolly
released
her
hand
and
said
"
Indeed
!
"
 
<EOS>
She
remarked
in
the
same
breath
that
it
was
a
fine
night
,
and
in
short
,
betrayed
no
more
emotion
than
the
forge
itself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
go
,
"
said
Joe
,
"
without
coming
to
see
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
n't
the
heart
to
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dolly
was
more
sorry
than
she
could
tell
,
that
he
should
have
taken
so
much
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
such
a
long
way
,
and
he
must
have
such
a
deal
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
And
how
WAS
Mr
Willet
---
that
dear
old
gentleman
---
   
<EOS>
"
Is
this
all
you
say
!
"
cried
Joe
.
  
<EOS>
All
!
 
<EOS>
Good
gracious
,
what
did
the
man
expect
!
 
<EOS>
She
was
obliged
to
take
her
apron
in
her
hand
and
run
her
eyes
along
the
hem
from
corner
to
corner
,
to
keep
herself
from
laughing
in
his
face
;
---
not
because
his
gaze
confused
her
---
not
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
Joe
had
small
experience
in
love
affairs
,
and
had
no
notion
how
different
young
ladies
are
at
different
times
;
he
had
expected
to
take
Dolly
up
again
at
the
very
point
where
he
had
left
her
after
that
delicious
evening
ride
,
and
was
no
more
prepared
for
such
an
alteration
than
to
see
the
sun
and
moon
change
places
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
buoyed
himself
up
all
day
with
an
indistinct
idea
that
she
would
certainly
say
"
Do
n't
go
,
"
or
"
Do
n't
leave
us
,
"
or
"
Why
do
you
go
?
"
or
"
Why
do
you
leave
us
?
"
or
would
give
him
some
little
encouragement
of
that
sort
;
he
had
even
entertained
the
possibility
of
her
bursting
into
tears
,
of
her
throwing
herself
into
his
arms
,
of
her
falling
down
in
a
fainting
fit
without
previous
word
or
sign
;
but
any
approach
to
such
a
line
of
conduct
as
this
,
had
been
so
far
from
his
thoughts
that
he
could
only
look
at
her
in
silent
wonder
.
  
<EOS>
Dolly
in
the
meanwhile
,
turned
to
the
corners
of
her
apron
,
and
measured
the
sides
,
and
smoothed
out
the
wrinkles
,
and
was
as
silent
as
he
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
after
a
long
pause
,
Joe
said
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
"
---
said
Dolly
---
with
as
pleasant
a
smile
as
if
he
were
going
into
the
next
street
,
and
were
coming
back
to
supper
;
"
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Come
,
"
said
Joe
,
putting
out
both
hands
,
"
Dolly
,
dear
Dolly
,
do
n't
let
us
part
like
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
love
you
dearly
,
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
;
with
as
much
truth
and
earnestness
as
ever
man
loved
woman
in
this
world
,
I
do
believe
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
a
poor
fellow
,
as
you
know
---
poorer
now
than
ever
,
for
I
have
fled
from
home
,
not
being
able
to
bear
it
any
longer
,
and
must
fight
my
own
way
without
help
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
beautiful
,
admired
,
are
loved
by
everybody
,
are
well
off
and
happy
;
and
may
you
ever
be
so
!
 
<EOS>
Heaven
forbid
<EOS>
I
should
ever
make
you
otherwise
;
but
give
me
a
word
of
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
Say
something
kind
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
right
to
expect
it
of
you
,
I
know
,
but
I
ask
it
because
I
love
you
,
and
shall
treasure
the
slightest
word
from
you
all
through
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
Dolly
,
dearest
,
have
you
nothing
to
say
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
No
.
 
Nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Dolly
was
a
coquette
by
nature
,
and
a
spoilt
child
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
notion
of
being
carried
by
storm
in
this
way
.
 
<EOS>
The
coachmaker
would
have
been
dissolved
in
tears
,
and
would
have
knelt
down
,
and
called
himself
names
,
and
clasped
his
hands
,
and
beat
his
breast
,
and
tugged
wildly
at
his
cravat
,
and
done
all
kinds
of
poetry
.
 
<EOS>
Joe
had
no
business
to
be
going
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
no
right
to
be
able
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
was
in
adamantine
chains
,
he
could
n't
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
said
good
-
bye
,
"
said
Dolly
,
"
twice
.
 
<EOS>
Take
your
arm
away
directly
,
Mr
Joseph
,
or
<EOS>
I
'll
call
Miggs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
not
reproach
you
,
"
answered
Joe
,
"
it
's
my
fault
,
no
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
thought
sometimes
that
you
did
n't
quite
despise
me
,
but
I
was
a
fool
to
think
so
.
 
<EOS>
Every
one
must
,
who
has
seen
the
life
I
have
led
---
you
most
of
all
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
gone
,
actually
gone
.
 
<EOS>
Dolly
waited
a
little
while
,
thinking
he
would
return
,
peeped
out
at
the
door
,
looked
up
the
street
and
down
as
well
as
the
increasing
darkness
would
allow
,
came
in
again
,
waited
a
little
longer
,
went
upstairs
humming
a
tune
,
bolted
herself
in
,
laid
her
head
down
on
her
bed
,
and
cried
as
if
her
heart
would
break
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
such
natures
are
made
up
of
so
many
contradictions
,
that
if
Joe
Willet
had
come
back
that
night
,
next
day
,
next
week
,
next
month
,
the
odds
are
a
hundred
to
one
she
would
have
treated
him
in
the
very
same
manner
,
and
have
wept
for
it
afterwards
with
the
very
same
distress
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
no
sooner
left
the
workshop
than
there
cautiously
peered
out
from
behind
the
chimney
of
the
forge
,
a
face
which
had
already
emerged
from
the
same
concealment
twice
or
thrice
,
unseen
,
and
which
,
after
satisfying
itself
that
it
was
now
alone
,
was
followed
by
a
leg
,
a
shoulder
,
and
so
on
by
degrees
,
until
the
form
of
Mr
Tappertit
stood
confessed
,
with
a
brown
-
paper
cap
stuck
negligently
on
one
side
of
its
head
,
and
its
arms
very
much
a
-
kimbo
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
my
ears
deceived
me
,
"
said
the
'
prentice
,
"
or
do
I
dream
!
<EOS>
am
I
to
thank
thee
,
Fortun
'
,
or
to
cus
thee
---
<EOS>
which
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
gravely
descended
from
his
elevation
,
took
down
his
piece
of
looking
-
glass
,
planted
it
against
the
wall
upon
the
usual
bench
,
twisted
his
head
round
,
and
looked
closely
at
his
legs
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
they
're
a
dream
,
"
said
Sim
,
"
let
sculptures
have
such
wisions
,
and
chisel
'em
out
when
they
wake
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
reality
.
 
<EOS>
Sleep
has
no
such
limbs
as
them
.
 
<EOS>
Tremble
,
Willet
,
and
despair
.
 
<EOS>
She
's
mine
!
<EOS>
She
's
mine
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
these
triumphant
expressions
,
he
seized
a
hammer
and
dealt
a
heavy
blow
at
a
vice
,
which
in
his
mind
's
eye
represented
the
sconce
or
head
of
Joseph
Willet
.
 
<EOS>
That
done
,
he
burst
into
a
peal
of
laughter
which
startled
Miss
Miggs
even
in
her
distant
kitchen
,
and
dipping
his
head
into
a
bowl
of
water
,
had
recourse
to
a
jack
-
towel
inside
the
closet
door
,
which
served
the
double
purpose
of
smothering
his
feelings
and
drying
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
Joe
,
disconsolate
and
down
-
hearted
,
but
full
of
courage
too
,
on
leaving
the
locksmith
's
house
made
the
best
of
his
way
to
the
Crooked
Billet
,
and
there
inquired
for
his
friend
the
serjeant
,
who
,
expecting
no
man
less
,
received
him
with
open
arms
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
five
minutes
after
his
arrival
at
that
house
of
entertainment
,
he
was
enrolled
among
the
gallant
defenders
of
his
native
land
;
and
within
half
an
hour
,
was
regaled
with
a
steaming
supper
of
boiled
tripe
and
onions
,
prepared
,
as
his
friend
assured
him
more
than
once
,
at
the
express
command
of
his
most
Sacred
Majesty
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
meal
,
which
tasted
very
savoury
after
his
long
fasting
,
he
did
ample
justice
;
and
when
he
had
followed
it
up
,
or
down
,
with
a
variety
of
loyal
and
patriotic
toasts
,
he
was
conducted
to
a
straw
mattress
in
a
loft
over
the
stable
,
and
locked
in
there
for
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
morning
,
he
found
that
the
obliging
care
of
his
martial
friend
had
decorated
his
hat
with
sundry
particoloured
streamers
,
which
made
a
very
lively
appearance
;
and
in
company
with
that
officer
,
and
three
other
military
gentlemen
newly
enrolled
,
who
were
under
a
cloud
<EOS>
so
dense
that
it
only
left
three
shoes
,
a
boot
,
and
a
coat
and
a
half
visible
among
them
,
repaired
to
the
riverside
.
 
<EOS>
Here
they
were
joined
by
a
corporal
and
four
more
heroes
,
of
whom
two
were
drunk
and
daring
,
and
two
sober
and
penitent
,
but
each
of
whom
,
like
Joe
,
had
his
dusty
stick
and
bundle
.
 
<EOS>
The
party
embarked
in
a
passage
-
boat
bound
for
Gravesend
,
whence
<EOS>
they
were
to
proceed
on
foot
to
Chatham
;
the
wind
was
in
their
favour
,
and
they
soon
left
London
behind
them
,
a
mere
dark
mist
---
a
giant
phantom
in
the
air
.

Chapter

Misfortunes
,
saith
the
adage
,
never
come
singly
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
little
doubt
that
troubles
are
exceedingly
gregarious
in
their
nature
,
and
flying
in
flocks
,
are
apt
to
perch
capriciously
;
crowding
on
the
heads
of
some
poor
wights
until
there
is
not
an
inch
of
room
left
on
their
unlucky
crowns
,
and
taking
no
more
notice
of
others
who
offer
as
good
resting
-
places
for
the
soles
of
their
feet
,
than
if
they
had
no
existence
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
have
happened
that
a
flight
of
troubles
brooding
over
London
,
and
looking
out
for
Joseph
Willet
,
whom
they
could
n't
find
,
darted
down
haphazard
on
the
first
young
man
that
caught
their
fancy
,
and
settled
on
him
instead
.
 
<EOS>
However
this
may
be
,
<EOS>
certain
it
is
that
on
the
very
day
of
Joe
's
departure
they
swarmed
about
the
ears
of
Edward
Chester
,
and
did
so
buzz
and
flap
their
wings
,
and
persecute
him
,
that
he
was
most
profoundly
wretched
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
evening
,
and
just
eight
o'clock
,
when
he
and
his
father
,
having
wine
and
dessert
set
before
them
,
were
left
to
themselves
for
the
first
time
that
day
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
dined
together
,
but
a
third
person
had
been
present
during
the
meal
,
and
until
they
met
at
table
they
had
not
seen
each
other
since
the
previous
night
.
  
<EOS>
Edward
was
reserved
and
silent
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Chester
was
more
than
usually
gay
;
but
not
caring
,
as
it
seemed
,
to
open
a
conversation
with
one
whose
humour
was
so
different
,
he
vented
the
lightness
of
his
spirit
in
smiles
and
sparkling
looks
,
and
made
no
effort
to
awaken
his
attention
.
 
<EOS>
So
they
remained
for
some
time
:
the
father
lying
on
a
sofa
with
his
accustomed
air
of
graceful
negligence
;
the
son
seated
opposite
to
him
with
downcast
eyes
,
busied
<EOS>
,
it
was
plain
,
with
painful
and
uneasy
thoughts
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Edward
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
at
length
,
with
a
most
engaging
laugh
,
"
do
not
extend
your
drowsy
influence
to
the
decanter
.
<EOS>
Suffer
THAT
to
circulate
,
let
your
spirits
be
never
so
stagnant
.
"
  
<EOS>
Edward
begged
his
pardon
,
passed
it
,
and
relapsed
into
his
former
state
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
wrong
not
to
fill
your
glass
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
holding
up
his
own
before
the
light
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wine
in
moderation
---
not
in
excess
,
for
that
makes
men
ugly
---
has
a
thousand
pleasant
influences
.
 
<EOS>
It
brightens
the
eye
,
improves
the
voice
,
imparts
a
new
vivacity
to
one
's
thoughts
and
conversation
<EOS>
:
you
should
try
it
,
Ned
.
"
  
"
Ah
father
!
"
<EOS>
cried
his
son
,
"
if
---
"
  
"
My
good
fellow
,
"
interposed
the
parent
hastily
,
as
he
set
down
his
glass
,
and
raised
his
eyebrows
with
a
startled
and
horrified
expression
,
"
for
Heaven
's
sake
do
n't
call
me
by
that
obsolete
and
ancient
name
.
 
<EOS>
Have
some
regard
for
delicacy
.
 
<EOS>
Am
I
grey
,
or
wrinkled
<EOS>
,
do
I
go
on
crutches
,
have
I
lost
my
teeth
,
that
you
adopt
such
a
mode
of
address
?
 
<EOS>
Good
God
,
how
very
coarse
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
about
to
speak
to
you
from
my
heart
,
sir
,
"
returned
Edward
,
"
in
the
confidence
which
should
subsist
between
us
;
and
you
check
me
in
the
outset
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
DO
,
Ned
,
DO
not
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
raising
his
delicate
hand
imploringly
,
"
talk
in
that
monstrous
manner
.
 
<EOS>
About
to
speak
from
your
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
know
that
the
heart
is
an
ingenious
part
of
our
formation
---
the
centre
of
the
blood
-
vessels
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
---
which
has
no
more
to
do
with
what
you
say
or
think
,
than
your
knees
have
?
 
<EOS>
How
can
you
be
so
very
vulgar
and
absurd
?
 
<EOS>
These
anatomical
allusions
should
be
left
to
gentlemen
of
the
medical
profession
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
really
not
agreeable
in
society
.
 
<EOS>
You
quite
surprise
me
,
Ned
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
there
are
no
such
things
to
wound
,
or
heal
,
or
have
regard
for
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
your
creed
,
sir
,
and
will
say
no
more
,
"
returned
his
son
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
again
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
sipping
his
wine
,
"
you
are
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
distinctly
say
there
are
such
things
.
 
<EOS>
We
know
there
are
.
 
<EOS>
The
hearts
of
animals
---
of
bullocks
,
sheep
,
and
so
forth
---
are
cooked
and
devoured
,
as
I
am
told
,
by
the
lower
classes
,
with
a
vast
deal
of
relish
.
 
<EOS>
Men
are
sometimes
stabbed
to
the
heart
,
shot
to
the
heart
;
but
as
to
speaking
from
the
heart
,
or
to
the
heart
,
or
being
warm
-
hearted
,
or
cold
-
hearted
,
or
broken
-
hearted
,
or
being
all
heart
,
or
having
no
heart
---
<EOS>
pah

<EOS>
these
things
are
nonsense

Ned
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
doubt

sir
,
"
returned
his
son
,
seeing
that
he
paused
for
him
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
doubt

<EOS>
"
There
's
Haredale
's
niece
,
your
late
flame
,
"
said
Mr
Chester
,
as
a
careless
illustration
of
his
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
in
your
mind
she
was
all
heart
once
.
 
<EOS>
Now
she
has
none
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
she
is
the
same
person
,
Ned
,
exactly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
a
changed
person
,
sir
,
"
cried
Edward
,
reddening
;
"
and
changed
by
vile
means
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
have
had
a
cool
dismissal
,
have
you
?
"
said
his
father
.
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
Ned
!
 
<EOS>
I
told
you
last
night
what
would
happen
.
<EOS>
---
May
I
ask
you
for
the
nutcrackers
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
been
tampered
with
,
and
most
treacherously
deceived
,
"
cried
Edward
,
rising
from
his
seat
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
will
believe
that
the
knowledge
of
my
real
position
,
given
her
by
myself
,
has
worked
this
change
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
<EOS>
she
is
beset
and
tortured
.
 
<EOS>
But
though
our
contract
is
at
an
end
,
and
broken
past
all
redemption
;
though
I
charge
upon
her
want
of
firmness
and
want
of
truth
,
both
to
herself
and
me
;
I
do
not
now
,
and
never
will
believe
,
that
any
sordid
motive
,
or
her
own
unbiassed
will
,
has
led
her
to
this
course
---
never
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
make
me
blush
,
"
returned
his
father
gaily
,
"
for
the
folly
of
your
nature
,
in
which
---
but
we
never
know
ourselves
<EOS>
---
I
devoutly
hope
there
is
no
reflection
of
my
own
.
 
<EOS>
With
regard
to
the
young
lady
herself
,
she
has
done
what
is
very
natural
and
proper
,
my
dear
fellow
;
what
you
yourself
proposed
,
as
I
learn
from
Haredale
;
and
what
I
predicted
---
with
no
great
exercise
of
sagacity
---
she
would
do
.
<EOS>
She
supposed
you
to
be
rich
,
or
at
least
quite
rich
enough
;
and
found
you
poor

it

an
affair

house

furniture

of

equipage

and
so
forth
.
 
<EOS>
The
lady
being
poor
and
you
poor
also
,
there
is
an
end
of
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
not
enter
upon
these
considerations

and
have
no
manner
of
business
with
the
ceremony

<EOS>
I
drink
her
health
in
this
glass
,
and
respect
and
honour
her
for
her
extreme
good
sense

<EOS>
It
is
a
lesson
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Fill
yours

Ned

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
lesson
,
"
returned
his
son
,
"
by
which
I
hope
I
may
never
profit
,
and
if
years
and
experience
impress
it
on
---
"
  
"
Do
n't
say
on
the
heart
,
"
interposed
his
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
On
men
whom
the
world
and
its
hypocrisy
have
spoiled
,
"
said
Edward
warmly
,
"
Heaven
keep
me
from
its
knowledge
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Come
,
sir
,
"
returned
his
father
,
raising
himself
a
little
on
the
sofa
,
and
looking
straight
towards
him
;
"
we
have
had
enough
of
this
.
 
<EOS>
Remember
,
if
you
please
,
your
interest
,
your
duty
,
your
moral
obligations
,
your
filial
affections
,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
,
which
it
is
so
very
delightful
and
charming
to
reflect
upon
;
or
you
will
repent
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
repent
the
preservation
of
my
self
-
respect
,
sir
,
"
said
Edward
.
 
<EOS>
"
Forgive
me
if
I
say
that
I
will
not
sacrifice
it
at
your
bidding
,
and
that
I
will
not
pursue
the
track
which
you
would
have
me
take
,
and
to
which
the
secret
share
you
have
had
in
this
late
separation
tends
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
father
rose
a
little
higher
still
,
and
looking
at
him
as
though
curious
to
know
if
he
were
quite
resolved
and
earnest
,
dropped
gently
down
again
,
and
said
in
the
calmest
voice
---
eating
his
nuts
meanwhile
,
  
"
Edward
,
my
father
had
a
son
,
who
being
a
fool
like
you
,
and
,
like
you
,
entertaining
low
and
disobedient
sentiments
,
he
disinherited
and
cursed
one
morning
after
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
The
circumstance
occurs
to
me
with
a
singular
clearness
of
recollection
this
evening
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
eating
muffins
at
the
time
,
with
marmalade
.
 
<EOS>
He
led
a
miserable
life
(
the
son
,
I
mean
)
and
died
early
;
it
was
a
happy
release
on
all
accounts
;
he
degraded
the
family
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
sad
circumstance
,
Edward
,
when
a
father
finds
it
necessary
to
resort
to
such
strong
measures
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
"
replied
Edward
,
"
and
it
is
sad
when
a
son
,
proffering
him
his
love
and
duty
in
their
best
and
truest
sense
,
<EOS>
finds
himself
repelled
at
every
turn
,
and
forced
to
disobey
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
father
,
"
he
added
,
more
earnestly
though
in
a
gentler
tone
,
"
I
have
reflected
many
times
on
what
occurred
between
us
when
we
first
discussed
this
subject
.
 
<EOS>
Let
there
be
a
confidence
between
us
;
not
in
terms
,
but
truth
.
 
<EOS>
Hear
what
I
have
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
As
I
anticipate
what
it
is
,
and
can
not
fail
to
do
so
,
Edward
,
"
returned
his
father
coldly
,
"
I
decline
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
n't
possibly
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
it
would
put
me
out
of
temper
,
which
is
a
state
of
mind
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
endure
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
intend
to
mar
my
plans
for
your
establishment
in
life
,
and
the
preservation
of
that
gentility
and
becoming
pride
,
which
our
family
have
so
long
sustained
---
if
,
in
short
,
you
are
resolved
to
take
your
own
course
,
you
must
take
it
,
and
my
curse
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
very
sorry
,
but
there
's
really
no
alternative
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
curse
may
pass
your
lips
,
"
said
Edward
,
"
but
it
will
be
<EOS>
but
empty
breath
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
believe
that
any
man
on
earth
has
greater
power
to
call
one
down
upon
his
fellow
---
least
of
all
,
upon
his
own
child
---
than
he
has
to
make
one
drop
of
rain
or
flake
of
snow
fall
from
the
clouds
above
us
at
his
impious
bidding
.
 
<EOS>
Beware
,
sir
,
what
you
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
so
very
irreligious
,
so
exceedingly
undutiful
,
so
horribly
profane
,
"
rejoined
his
father
,
turning
his
face
lazily
towards
him
,
and
cracking
another
nut
,
"
that
I
positively
must
interrupt
you
here
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
quite
impossible
we
can
continue
to
go
on
,
upon
such
terms
as
these
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
will
do
me
the
favour
to
ring
the
bell
,
the
servant
will
show
you
to
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Return
to
this
roof
no
more
<EOS>
,
I
beg
you
.
 
<EOS>
Go
,
sir
,
since
you
have
no
moral
sense
remaining
;
and
go
to
the
Devil
,
at
my
express
desire
.
 
<EOS>
Good
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Edward
left
the
room
without
another
word
or
look
,
and
turned
his
back
upon
the
house
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
The
father
's
face
was
slightly
flushed
and
heated
,
but
his
manner
was
quite
unchanged
,
as
he
rang
the
bell
again
,
and
addressed
the
servant
on
his
entrance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Peak
---
if
that
gentleman
who
has
just
gone
out
---
"
  
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
Mr
Edward
?
"
  
"
Were
there
more
than
one
,
dolt
,
that
you
ask
the
question
?
---
<EOS>
If
that
gentleman
should
send
here
for
his
wardrobe
,
let
him
have
it
,
do
you
hear
?
 
<EOS>
If
he
should
call
himself
at
any
time
,
I
'm
not
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
tell
him
so
,
and
shut
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
,
it
soon
got
whispered
about
,
that
Mr
Chester
was
very
unfortunate
in
his
son
,
who
had
occasioned
him
great
grief
and
sorrow
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
good
people
who
heard
this
and
told
it
again
,
marvelled
the
more
at
his
equanimity
and
even
temper
,
and
said
what
an
amiable
nature
that
man
must
have
,
who
,
having
undergone
so
much
,
could
be
so
placid
and
so
calm
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
Edward
's
name
was
spoken
,
Society
shook
its
head
,
and
laid
its
finger
on
its
lip
,
and
sighed
,
and
looked
very
grave
;
and
those
who
had
sons
about
his
age
,
waxed
wrathful
and
indignant
,
and
hoped
,
for
Virtue
's
sake
,
that
he
was
dead
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
world
went
on
turning
round
,
as
usual
,
for
five
years
,
concerning
which
this
Narrative
is
silent
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
33
    
<EOS>
One
wintry
evening
,
early
in
the
year
of
our
Lord
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
eighty
,
<EOS>
a
keen
north
wind
arose
as
it
grew
dark
,
and
night
came
on
with
black
and
dismal
looks
.
 
<EOS>
A
bitter
storm
of
sleet
,
sharp
,
dense
,
and
icy
-
cold
,
swept
the
wet
streets
,
and
rattled
on
the
trembling
windows
.
 
<EOS>
Signboards
,
shaken
past
endurance
in
their
creaking
frames
,
fell
crashing
on
the
pavement
;
old
tottering
chimneys
reeled
and
staggered
in
the
blast
;
and
many
a
steeple
rocked
again
that
night
,
as
though
the
earth
were
troubled
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
a
time
for
those
who
could
by
any
means
get
light
and
warmth
,
to
brave
the
fury
of
the
weather
.
 
<EOS>
In
coffee
-
houses
of
the
better
sort
,
guests
crowded
round
the
fire
,
forgot
to
be
political
,
and
told
each
other
with
a
secret
gladness
that
the
blast
grew
fiercer
every
minute
.
 
<EOS>
Each
humble
tavern
by
the
water
-
side
,
had
its
group
of
uncouth
figures
round
the
hearth
,
who
talked
of
vessels
foundering
at
sea
,
and
all
hands
lost
;
related
many
a
dismal
tale
of
shipwreck
and
drowned
men
,
and
hoped
that
some
they
knew
were
safe
,
and
shook
their
heads
in
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
In
private
dwellings
,
children
clustered
near
the
blaze
;
listening
with
timid
pleasure
to
tales
of
ghosts
and
goblins
,
and
tall
figures
clad
in
white
standing
by
bed
-
sides
,
and
people
who
had
gone
to
sleep
in
old
churches
and
being
overlooked
had
found
themselves
alone
there
at
the
dead
hour
of
the
night
:
until
they
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
the
dark
rooms
upstairs
,
yet
loved
to
hear
the
wind
moan
too
,
and
hoped
it
would
continue
bravely
.
 
<EOS>
From
time
to
time
these
happy
indoor
people
stopped
to
listen
,
or
one
held
up
his
finger
and
cried
"
Hark
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
,
above
the
rumbling
in
the
chimney
,
and
the
fast
pattering
on
the
glass
,
was
heard
a
wailing
,
rushing
sound
,
which
shook
the
walls
as
though
a
giant
's
hand
were
on
them
;
then
a
hoarse
roar
as
if
the
sea
had
risen
;
then
such
a
whirl
and
tumult
that
the
air
seemed
mad
;
and
then
,
with
a
lengthened
howl
,
the
waves
of
wind
swept
on
,
and
left
a
moment
's
interval
of
rest
.
  
<EOS>
Cheerily
,
though
there
were
none
abroad
to
see
it
,
shone
the
Maypole
light
that
evening
.
 
<EOS>
Blessings
on
the
red
---
deep
,
ruby
,
glowing
red
---
old
curtain
of
the
window
;
blending
into
one
rich
stream
of
brightness
,
fire
and
candle
,
meat
,
drink
,
and
company
,
and
gleaming
like
a
jovial
eye
upon
the
bleak
waste
out
of
doors
!
<EOS>
Within
,
what
carpet
like
its
crunching
sand
,
what
music
merry
as
its
crackling
logs
,
what
perfume
like
its
kitchen
's
dainty
breath
,
what
weather
genial
as
its
hearty
warmth
!
 
<EOS>
Blessings
on
the
old
house
,
how
sturdily
it
stood
!
 
<EOS>
How
did
the
vexed
wind
chafe
and
roar
about
its
stalwart
roof
;
how
did
it
pant
and
strive
with
its
wide
chimneys
,
which
still
poured
forth
from
their
hospitable
throats
,
great
clouds
of
smoke
,
and
puffed
defiance
in
its
face
;
how
,
above
all
,
did
it
drive
and
rattle
at
the
casement
,
emulous
to
extinguish
that
cheerful
glow
,
which
would
not
be
put
down
and
seemed
the
brighter
for
the
conflict
!
  
<EOS>
The
profusion
too
,
the
rich
and
lavish
bounty
,
of
that
goodly
tavern
!
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
enough
that
one
fire
roared
and
sparkled
on
its
spacious
hearth
;
in
the
tiles
which
paved
and
compassed
it
,
five
hundred
flickering
fires
burnt
brightly
also
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
enough
that
one
red
curtain
shut
the
wild
night
out
,
and
shed
its
cheerful
influence
on
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
In
every
saucepan
lid
,
and
candlestick
,
and
vessel
of
copper
,
brass
,
or
tin
that
hung
upon
the
walls
,
were
countless
ruddy
hangings
,
flashing
and
gleaming
with
every
motion
of
the
blaze
,
and
offering
,
<EOS>
let
the
eye
wander
where
it
might
,
interminable
vistas
of
the
same
rich
colour
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
oak
wainscoting
,
the
beams
,
the
chairs
,
the
seats
,
reflected
it
in
a
deep
,
dull
glimmer
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
fires
and
red
curtains
in
the
very
eyes
of
the
drinkers
,
in
their
buttons
,
in
their
liquor
,
in
the
pipes
they
smoked
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Willet
sat
in
what
had
been
his
accustomed
place
five
years
before
,
with
his
eyes
on
the
eternal
boiler
;
and
had
sat
there
since
the
clock
struck
eight
,
giving
no
other
signs
of
life
than
breathing
with
a
loud
and
constant
snore
(
though
he
was
wide
awake
)
,
and
from
time
to
time
putting
his
glass
to
his
lips
,
or
knocking
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
,
and
filling
it
anew
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
now
half
-
past
ten
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Cobb
and
long
Phil
Parkes
were
his
companions
,
as
of
old
,
and
for
two
mortal
hours
and
a
half
,
none
of
the
company
had
pronounced
one
word
.
  
<EOS>
Whether
people
,
by
dint
of
sitting
together
in
the
same
place
and
the
same
relative
positions
,
and
doing
exactly
the
same
things
for
a
great
many
years
,
acquire
a
sixth
sense
,
or
some
unknown
power
of
influencing
each
other
which
serves
them
in
its
stead
,
is
a
question
for
philosophy
to
settle
.
 
<EOS>
But
certain
it
is
that
old
John
Willet
,
Mr
Parkes
,
and
Mr
Cobb
,
were
one
and
all
firmly
of
opinion
that
they
were
very
jolly
companions
---
rather
choice
spirits
than
otherwise
;
that
they
looked
at
each
other
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
as
if
there
were
a
perpetual
interchange
of
ideas
going
on
among
them
;
that
no
man
considered
himself
or
his
neighbour
by
any
means
silent
;
and
that
each
of
them
nodded
occasionally
when
he
caught
the
eye
of
another
,
as
if
he
would
say
,
"
You
have
expressed
yourself
extremely
well
,
sir
,
in
relation
to
that
sentiment
,
and
I
quite
agree
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
room
was
so
very
warm
,
the
tobacco
so
very
good
,
and
the
fire
so
very
soothing
,
that
Mr
Willet
by
degrees
began
to
doze
;
but
as
he
had
perfectly
acquired
,
by
dint
of
long
habit
,
the
art
of
smoking
in
his
sleep
,
and
as
his
breathing
was
pretty
much
the
same
,
awake
or
asleep
,
saving
that
in
the
latter
case
he
sometimes
experienced
a
slight
difficulty
in
respiration
(
such
as
a
carpenter
meets
with
when
he
is
planing
and
comes
to
a
knot
)
,
neither
of
his
companions
was
aware
of
the
circumstance
,
until
he
met
with
one
of
these
impediments
and
was
obliged
to
try
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Johnny
's
dropped
off
,
"
said
Mr
Parkes
in
a
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
Fast
as
a
top
,
"
said
Mr
Cobb
.
  
<EOS>
Neither
of
them
said
any
more
until
Mr
Willet
came
to
another
knot
---
 
one
of
surpassing
obduracy
---
which
bade
fair
to
throw
him
into
convulsions
,
but
which
he
got
over
at
last
without
waking
,
by
an
effort
quite
superhuman
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
sleeps
uncommon
hard
,
"
said
Mr
Cobb
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Parkes
,
who
was
possibly
a
hard
-
sleeper
himself
,
replied
with
some
disdain
,
"
Not
a
bit
on
it
;
"
and
directed
his
eyes
towards
a
handbill
pasted
over
the
chimney
-
piece
,
which
was
decorated
at
the
top
with
a
woodcut
representing
a
youth
of
tender
years
running
away
very
fast
,
with
a
bundle
over
his
shoulder
at
the
end
of
a
stick
,
and
---
to
carry
out
the
idea
---
a
finger
-
post
and
a
milestone
beside
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Cobb
likewise
turned
his
eyes
in
the
same
direction
,
and
surveyed
the
placard
as
if
that
were
the
first
time
he
had
ever
beheld
it
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
this
was
a
document
which
Mr
Willet
had
himself
indited
on
the
disappearance
of
his
son
Joseph
,
acquainting
the
nobility
and
gentry
and
the
public
in
general
with
the
circumstances
of
his
having
left
his
home
;
describing
his
dress
and
appearance
;
and
offering
a
reward
of
five
pounds
to
any
person
or
persons
who
would
pack
him
up
and
return
him
safely
to
the
Maypole
at
Chigwell
,
or
lodge
him
in
any
of
his
Majesty
's
jails
until
such
time
as
his
father
should
come
and
claim
him
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
advertisement
Mr
Willet
had
obstinately
persisted
,
despite
the
advice
and
entreaties
of
his
friends
,
in
describing
his
son
as
a
"
young
boy
;
"
and
furthermore
as
being
from
eighteen
inches
to
a
couple
of
feet
shorter
than
he
really
was
;
two
circumstances
which
perhaps
accounted
,
in
some
degree
,
for
its
never
having
been
productive
of
any
other
effect
than
the
transmission
to
Chigwell
at
various
times
and
at
a
vast
expense
,
of
some
five
-
and
-
forty
runaways
varying
from
six
years
old
to
twelve
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Cobb
and
Mr
Parkes
looked
mysteriously
at
this
composition
,
at
each
other
,
and
at
old
John
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
time
he
had
pasted
it
up
with
his
own
hands
,
Mr
Willet
had
never
by
word
or
sign
alluded
to
the
subject
,
or
encouraged
any
one
else
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
had
the
least
notion
what
his
thoughts
or
opinions
were
,
connected
with
it
;
whether
he
remembered
it
or
forgot
it
;
whether
he
had
any
idea
that
such
an
event
had
ever
taken
place
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
even
while
he
slept
,
no
one
ventured
to
refer
to
it
in
his
presence
;
and
for
such
sufficient
reasons
,
these
his
chosen
friends
were
silent
now
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Willet
had
got
by
this
time
into
such
a
complication
of
knots
,
that
it
was
perfectly
clear
he
must
wake
or
die
.
 
<EOS>
He
chose
the
former
alternative
,
and
opened
his
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
he
do
n't
come
in
five
minutes
,
"
said
John
,
"
I
shall
have
supper
without
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
antecedent
of
this
pronoun
had
been
mentioned
for
the
last
time
at
eight
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
Messrs
Parkes
and
Cobb
being
used
to
this
style
of
conversation
,
replied
without
difficulty
that
to
be
sure
Solomon
was
very
late
,
and
they
wondered
what
had
happened
to
detain
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
an't
blown
away
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Parkes
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
enough
to
carry
a
man
of
his
figure
off
his
legs
,
and
easy
too
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
it
?
 
<EOS>
It
blows
great
guns
,
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
There
'll
be
many
a
crash
in
the
Forest
to
-
night
,
I
reckon
,
and
many
a
broken
branch
upon
the
ground
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
wo
n't
break
anything
in
the
Maypole
<EOS>
,
I
take
it
,
sir
,
"
returned
old
John
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
it
try
.
 
<EOS>
I
give
it
<EOS>
leave
---
<EOS>
what
's
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
wind
,
"
cried
Parkes
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
howling
like
a
Christian
,
and
has
been
all
night
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
ever
,
sir
,
"
asked
John
,
after
a
minute
's
contemplation
,
"
hear
the
wind
say
"
Maypole
"
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
man
ever
did
?
"
said
Parkes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
"
ahoy
,
"
perhaps
?
"
added
John
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
Nor
that
neither
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Very
good
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Willet
,
perfectly
unmoved
;
"
then
if
that
was
the
wind
just
now
,
<EOS>
and
you
'll
wait
a
little
time
without
speaking
<EOS>
,
you
'll
hear
it
say
both
words
very
plain
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Willet
was
right
.
 
<EOS>
After
listening
for
a
few
moments
,
they
could
clearly
hear
,
above
the
roar
and
tumult
out
of
doors
,
this
shout
repeated
;
and
that
with
a
shrillness
and
energy
,
which
denoted
that
it
came
from
some
person
in
great
distress
or
terror
.
 
<EOS>
They
looked
at
each
other
,
turned
pale
,
and
held
their
breath
.
 
<EOS>
No
man
stirred
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
in
this
emergency
that
Mr
Willet
displayed
something
of
that
strength
of
mind
and
plenitude
of
mental
resource
,
which
rendered
him
the
admiration
of
all
his
friends
and
neighbours
.
 
<EOS>
After
looking
at
Messrs
Parkes
and
Cobb
for
some
time
in
silence
,
he
clapped
his
two
hands
to
his
cheeks
,
and
sent
forth
a
roar
which
made
the
glasses
dance
and
rafters
ring
---
a
long
-
sustained
,
discordant
bellow
,
that
rolled
onward
with
the
wind
,
and
startling
every
echo
,
made
the
night
a
hundred
times
more
boisterous
---
a
deep
,
loud
,
dismal
bray
,
that
sounded
like
a
human
gong
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
with
every
vein
in
his
head
and
face
swollen
with
the
great
exertion
,
and
his
countenance
suffused
with
a
lively
purple
,
he
drew
a
little
nearer
to
the
fire
,
and
turning
his
back
upon
it
,
said
with
dignity
:
  
<EOS>
"
If
that
's
any
comfort
to
anybody
,
they
're
welcome
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
an't
,
I
'm
sorry
for
'em
.
 
<EOS>
If
either
of
you
two
gentlemen
likes
to
go
out
and
see
what
's
the
matter
,
you
can
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
not
curious
,
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
While
he
spoke
the
cry
drew
nearer
and
nearer
,
footsteps
passed
the
window
,
the
latch
of
the
door
was
raised
,
it
opened
,
was
violently
shut
again
,
and
Solomon
Daisy
,
with
a
lighted
lantern
in
his
hand
,
and
the
rain
streaming
from
his
disordered
dress
,
dashed
into
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
A
more
complete
picture
of
terror
than
the
little
man
presented
,
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
The
perspiration
stood
in
beads
upon
his
face
,
his
knees
knocked
together
,
his
every
limb
trembled
,
the
power
of
articulation
was
quite
gone
;
and
there
he
stood
,
panting
for
breath
,
gazing
on
them
with
such
livid
ashy
looks
,
that
they
were
infected
with
his
fear
,
though
ignorant
of
its
occasion
,
and
,
reflecting
his
dismayed
and
horror
-
stricken
visage
,
stared
back
again
without
venturing
to
question
him
;
until
old
John
Willet
,
in
a
fit
of
temporary
insanity
,
made
a
dive
at
his
cravat
,
and
,
seizing
him
by
that
portion
of
his
dress
,
shook
him
to
and
fro
until
his
very
teeth
appeared
to
rattle
in
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
us
what
's
the
matter
,
sir
,
"
said
John
,
"
or
I
'll
kill
you
.
<EOS>
Tell
us
what
's
the
matter
,
sir
,
or
in
another
second
I
'll
have
your
head
under
the
biler
.
 
<EOS>
How
dare
you
look
like
that
?
 
<EOS>
Is
anybody
a
-
following
of
you
?
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
?
 
<EOS>
Say
something
,
or
I
'll
be
the
death
of
you
,
I
will
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Willet
,
in
his
frenzy
,
was
so
near
keeping
his
word
to
the
very
letter
<EOS>
(
Solomon
Daisy
's
eyes
already
beginning
to
roll
in
an
alarming
manner
,
and
certain
guttural
sounds
,
as
of
a
choking
man
,
to
issue
from
his
throat
)
,
that
the
two
bystanders
,
recovering
in
some
degree
,
plucked
him
off
his
victim
by
main
force
,
and
placed
the
little
clerk
of
Chigwell
in
a
chair
.
 
<EOS>
Directing
a
fearful
gaze
all
round
the
room
,
he
implored
them
in
a
faint
voice
to
give
him
some
drink
;
and
above
all
to
lock
the
house
-
door
and
close
and
bar
the
shutters
of
the
room
,
without
a
moment
's
loss
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
The
latter
request
did
not
tend
to
reassure
his
hearers
,
or
to
fill
them
with
the
most
comfortable
sensations
;
they
complied
with
it
,
however
,
with
the
greatest
expedition
;
and
having
handed
him
a
bumper
of
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
nearly
boiling
hot
,
waited
to
hear
what
he
might
have
to
tell
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Johnny
,
"
said
Solomon
,
shaking
him
by
the
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Parkes
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Tommy
Cobb
.
 
<EOS>
Why
did
I
leave
this
house
to
-
night
!
 
<EOS>
On
the
nineteenth
of
March
---
of
all
nights
in
the
year
,
on
the
nineteenth
of
March
!
"
  
<EOS>
They
all
drew
closer
to
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
Parkes
,
who
was
nearest
to
the
door
,
started
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Willet
,
with
great
indignation
,
inquired
what
the
devil
he
meant
by
that
---
and
then
said
,
"
God
forgive
me
,
"
and
glanced
over
his
own
shoulder
,
and
came
a
little
nearer
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
I
left
here
to
-
night
,
"
said
Solomon
Daisy
,
"
I
little
thought
what
day
of
the
month
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
gone
alone
into
the
church
after
dark
on
this
day
,
for
seven
-
and
-
twenty
years
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
heard
it
said
that
as
we
keep
our
birthdays
when
we
are
alive
,
so
the
ghosts
of
dead
people
,
who
are
not
easy
in
their
graves
,
keep
the
day
they
died
upon
.
<EOS>
---
How
the
wind
roars
!
"
  
<EOS>
Nobody
spoke
.
 
<EOS>
All
eyes
were
fastened
on
Solomon
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
might
have
known
,
"
he
said
,
"
what
night
it
was
,
by
the
foul
weather
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
no
such
night
in
the
whole
year
round
as
this
is
,
always
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
sleep
quietly
in
my
bed
on
the
nineteenth
of
March
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Go
on
,
"
said
Tom
Cobb
,
in
a
low
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nor
I
neither
.
"
  
<EOS>
Solomon
Daisy
raised
his
glass
to
his
lips
;
put
it
down
upon
the
floor
with
such
a
trembling
hand
that
the
spoon
tinkled
in
it
like
a
little
bell
;
and
continued
thus
:
  
<EOS>
"
Have
I
ever
said
that
we
are
always
brought
back
to
this
subject
in
some
strange
way
,
when
the
nineteenth
of
this
month
comes
round
?
<EOS>
Do
you
suppose
it
was
by
accident
,
I
forgot
to
wind
up
the
church
-
clock
?
 
<EOS>
I
never
forgot
it
at
any
other
time
,
though
it
's
such
a
clumsy
thing
that
it
has
to
be
wound
up
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
Why
should
it
escape
my
memory
on
this
day
of
all
others
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
made
as
much
haste
down
there
as
I
could
when
I
went
from
here
,
but
I
had
to
go
home
first
for
the
keys
;
and
the
wind
and
rain
being
dead
against
me
all
the
way
<EOS>
,
it
was
pretty
well
as
much
as
I
could
do
at
times
to
keep
my
legs
.
 
<EOS>
I
got
there
at
last
,
opened
the
church
-
door
,
and
went
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
not
met
a
soul
all
the
way
,
and
you
may
judge
whether
it
was
dull
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
of
you
would
bear
me
company
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
could
have
known
what
was
to
come
,
you
'd
have
been
in
the
right
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
wind
was
so
strong
,
that
it
was
as
much
as
I
could
do
to
shut
the
church
-
door
by
putting
my
whole
weight
against
it
;
and
even
as
it
was
,
it
burst
wide
open
twice
,
with
such
strength
that
any
of
you
would
have
sworn
,
if
you
had
been
leaning
against
it
,
as
I
was
,
that
somebody
was
pushing
on
the
other
side
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
I
got
the
key
turned
,
went
into
the
belfry
,
and
wound
up
the
clock
---
which
was
very
near
run
down
,
and
would
have
stood
stock
-
still
in
half
an
hour
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
I
took
up
my
lantern
again
to
leave
the
church
,
it
came
upon
me
all
at
once
that
this
was
the
nineteenth
of
March
.
 
<EOS>
It
came
upon
me
with
a
kind
of
shock
,
<EOS>
as
if
a
hand
had
struck
the
thought
upon
my
forehead
;
at
the
very
same
moment
,
I
heard
a
voice
outside
the
tower
---
rising
from
among
the
graves
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Here
old
John
precipitately
interrupted
the
speaker
,
and
begged
that
if
Mr
Parkes
(
who
was
seated
opposite
to
him
and
was
staring
directly
over
his
head
)
saw
anything
,
he
would
have
the
goodness
to
mention
it
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Parkes
apologised
,
and
remarked
that
he
was
only
listening
;
to
which
Mr
Willet
angrily
retorted
,
that
his
listening
with
that
kind
of
expression
in
his
face
was
not
agreeable
,
and
that
if
he
could
n't
look
like
other
people
,
he
had
better
put
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
over
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Parkes
with
great
submission
pledged
himself
to
do
so
,
if
again
required
,
and
John
Willet
turning
to
Solomon
desired
him
to
proceed
.
 
<EOS>
After
waiting
until
a
violent
gust
of
wind
and
rain
,
which
seemed
to
shake
even
that
sturdy
house
to
its
foundation
,
had
passed
away
,
the
little
man
complied
:
  
"
<EOS>
Never
tell
me
that
it
was
my
fancy
,
or
that
it
was
any
other
sound
which
I
mistook
for
that
I
tell
you
of
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
the
wind
whistle
through
the
arches
of
the
church
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
the
steeple
strain
and
creak
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
the
rain
as
it
came
driving
against
the
walls
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
the
bells
shake
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
the
ropes
sway
to
and
fro
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
heard
that
voice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
it
say
?
"
asked
Tom
Cobb
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
;
I
do
n't
know
that
it
spoke
.
 
<EOS>
It
gave
a
kind
of
cry
,
as
any
one
of
us
might
do
,
if
something
dreadful
followed
us
in
a
dream
,
and
came
upon
us
unawares
;
and
then
it
died
off
:
seeming
to
pass
quite
round
the
church
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
much
in
that
,
"
said
John
,
drawing
a
long
breath
,
and
looking
round
him
like
a
man
who
felt
relieved
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
not
,
"
returned
his
friend
,
"
but
that
's
not
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
more
do
you
mean
to
say
,
sir
,
is
to
come
?
"
<EOS>
asked
John
,
pausing
in
the
act
of
wiping
his
face
upon
his
apron
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
a
-
going
to
tell
us
of
next
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
I
saw
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Saw
!
"
echoed
all
three
,
bending
forward
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
I
opened
the
church
-
door
to
come
out
,
"
said
the
little
man
,
with
an
expression
of
face
which
bore
ample
testimony
to
the
sincerity
of
his
conviction
,
"
when
I
opened
the
church
-
door
to
come
out
,
which
I
did
suddenly
,
for
I
wanted
to
get
it
shut
again
before
another
gust
of
wind
came
up
,
there
crossed
me
---
so
close
,
that
by
stretching
out
my
finger
I
could
have
touched
it
---
something
in
the
likeness
of
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
bare
-
headed
to
the
storm
.
 
<EOS>
It
turned
its
face
without
stopping
,
and
fixed
its
eyes
on
mine
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
ghost
---
 
a
spirit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whose
?
"
they
all
three
cried
together
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
excess
of
his
emotion
(
for
he
fell
back
trembling
in
his
chair
,
and
waved
his
hand
as
if
entreating
them
to
question
him
no
further
)
,
his
answer
was
lost
on
all
but
old
John
Willet
,
who
happened
to
be
seated
close
beside
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Parkes
and
Tom
Cobb
,
looking
eagerly
by
turns
at
Solomon
Daisy
and
at
Mr
Willet
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
was
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
"
said
Mr
Willet
after
a
long
pause
,
"
you
need
n't
ask
.
<EOS>
The
likeness
of
a
murdered
man
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
nineteenth
of
March
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
A
profound
silence
ensued
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
'll
take
my
advice
,
"
said
John
,
"
we
had
better
,
one
and
all
,
keep
this
a
secret
.
 
<EOS>
Such
tales
would
not
be
liked
at
the
Warren
.
<EOS>
Let
us
keep
it
to
ourselves
for
the
present
time
at
all
events
,
or
we
may
get
into
trouble
,
and
Solomon
may
lose
his
place
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
it
was
really
as
he
says
,
or
whether
it
was
n't
,
is
no
matter
.
<EOS>
Right
or
wrong
,
nobody
would
believe
him
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
the
probabilities
,
I
do
n't
myself
think
,
"
said
Mr
Willet
,
eyeing
the
corners
of
the
room
in
a
manner
which
showed
that
,
like
some
other
philosophers
,
he
was
not
quite
easy
in
his
theory
,
"
that
a
ghost
as
had
been
a
man
of
sense
in
his
lifetime
,
would
be
out
a
-
walking
in
such
weather
<EOS>
---
I
only
know
that
I
would
n't
,
if
I
was
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
this
heretical
doctrine
was
strongly
opposed
by
the
other
three
,
who
quoted
a
great
many
precedents
to
show
that
bad
weather
was
the
very
time
for
such
appearances
;
and
Mr
Parkes
(
who
had
had
a
ghost
in
his
family
,
by
the
mother
's
side
)
argued
the
matter
with
so
much
ingenuity
and
force
of
illustration
,
that
John
was
only
saved
from
having
to
retract
his
opinion
by
the
opportune
appearance
of
supper
,
to
which
they
applied
themselves
with
a
dreadful
relish
.
 
<EOS>
Even
Solomon
Daisy
himself
,
by
dint
of
the
elevating
influences
of
fire
,
lights
,
brandy
,
and
good
company
,
so
far
recovered
as
to
handle
his
knife
and
fork
in
a
highly
creditable
manner
,
and
to
display
a
capacity
both
of
eating
and
drinking
,
such
as
banished
all
fear
of
his
having
sustained
any
lasting
injury
from
his
fright
.
  
<EOS>
Supper
done
,
they
crowded
round
the
fire
again
,
and
,
as
is
common
on
such
occasions
,
propounded
all
manner
of
leading
questions
calculated
to
surround
the
story
with
new
horrors
and
surprises
.
<EOS>
But
Solomon
Daisy
,
notwithstanding
these
temptations
,
adhered
so
steadily
to
his
original
account
,
and
repeated
it
so
often
,
with
such
slight
variations
,
and
with
such
solemn
asseverations
of
its
truth
and
reality
,
that
his
hearers
were
(
with
good
reason
)
more
astonished
than
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
took
John
Willet
's
view
of
the
matter
in
regard
to
the
propriety
of
not
bruiting
the
tale
abroad
,
unless
the
spirit
should
appear
to
him
again
,
in
which
case
it
would
be
necessary
to
take
immediate
counsel
with
the
clergyman
,
it
was
solemnly
resolved
that
it
should
be
hushed
up
and
kept
quiet
.
<EOS>
And
as
most
men
like
to
have
a
secret
to
tell
which
may
exalt
their
own
importance
,
they
arrived
at
this
conclusion
with
perfect
unanimity
.
  
<EOS>
As
it
was
by
this
time
growing
late
,
and
was
long
past
their
usual
hour
of
separating
,
the
cronies
parted
for
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
Solomon
Daisy
,
with
a
fresh
candle
in
his
lantern
,
repaired
homewards
under
the
escort
of
long
Phil
Parkes
and
Mr
Cobb
,
who
were
rather
more
nervous
than
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Willet
,
after
seeing
them
to
the
door
,
returned
to
collect
his
thoughts
with
the
assistance
of
the
boiler
,
and
to
listen
to
the
storm
of
wind
and
rain
,
which
had
not
yet
abated
one
jot
of
its
fury
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
34
    
Before
old
John
had
looked
at
the
boiler
quite
twenty
minutes
,
he
got
his
ideas
into
a
focus
,
and
brought
them
to
bear
upon
Solomon
Daisy
's
story
.
 
<EOS>
The
more
he
thought
of
it
,
the
more
impressed
he
became
with
a
sense
of
his
own
wisdom
,
and
a
desire
that
Mr
Haredale
should
be
impressed
with
it
likewise
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
to
the
end
that
he
might
sustain
a
principal
and
important
character
in
the
affair
;
and
might
have
the
start
of
Solomon
and
his
two
friends
,
through
whose
means
he
knew
the
adventure
,
with
a
variety
of
exaggerations
,
would
be
known
to
at
least
a
score
of
people
,
and
most
likely
to
Mr
Haredale
himself
,
by
breakfast
-
time
to
-
morrow
;
he
determined
to
repair
to
the
Warren
before
going
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
my
landlord
,
"
thought
John
,
as
he
took
a
candle
in
his
hand
,
and
setting
it
down
in
a
corner
out
of
the
wind
's
way
,
opened
a
casement
in
the
rear
of
the
house
,
looking
towards
the
stables
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
n't
met
of
late
years
so
often
as
we
used
to
do
---
changes
are
taking
place
in
the
family
<EOS>
---
it
's
desirable
that
I
should
stand
as
well
with
them
,
in
point
of
dignity
,
as
possible
---
<EOS>
the
whispering
about
of
this
here
tale
will
anger
him
<EOS>
---
it
's
good
to
have
confidences
with
a
gentleman
of
his
natur
'
,
and
set
one's
-
self
right
besides
.
 
<EOS>
Halloa
there
!
 
<EOS>
Hugh
---
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
Hal
-
loa
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
he
had
repeated
this
shout
a
dozen
times
,
and
startled
every
pigeon
from
its
slumbers
,
a
door
in
one
of
the
ruinous
old
buildings
opened
,
and
a
rough
voice
demanded
what
was
amiss
now
,
that
a
man
could
n't
even
have
his
sleep
in
quiet
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
 
<EOS>
Have
n't
you
sleep
enough
,
growler
,
that
you
're
not
to
be
knocked
up
for
once
?
"
said
John
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
the
voice
,
as
the
speaker
yawned
and
shook
himself
.
<EOS>
"
Not
half
enough
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
how
you
CAN
sleep
,
with
the
wind
a
bellowsing
and
roaring
about
you
,
making
the
tiles
fly
like
a
pack
of
cards
,
"
said
John
;
"
but
no
matter
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
Wrap
yourself
up
in
something
or
another
,
and
come
here
,
for
you
must
go
as
far
as
the
Warren
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
look
sharp
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
,
with
much
low
growling
and
muttering
,
went
back
into
his
lair
;
and
presently
reappeared
,
carrying
a
lantern
and
a
cudgel
,
and
enveloped
from
head
to
foot
in
an
old
,
frowzy
,
slouching
horse
-
cloth
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Willet
received
this
figure
at
the
back
-
door
,
and
ushered
him
into
the
bar
,
while
he
wrapped
himself
in
sundry
greatcoats
and
capes
,
and
so
tied
and
knotted
his
face
in
shawls
and
handkerchiefs
,
that
how
he
breathed
was
a
mystery
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
take
a
man
out
of
doors
at
near
midnight
in
such
weather
,
without
putting
some
heart
into
him
,
do
you
,
master
?
"
said
Hugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
I
do
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mr
Willet
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
put
the
heart
(
as
you
call
it
)
into
him
when
he
has
brought
me
safe
home
again
,
and
his
standing
steady
on
his
legs
an't
of
so
much
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
So
hold
that
light
up
,
if
you
please
,
and
go
on
a
step
or
two
before
,
to
show
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
Hugh
obeyed
with
a
very
indifferent
grace
,
and
a
longing
glance
at
the
bottles
.
 
<EOS>
Old
John
,
laying
strict
injunctions
on
his
cook
to
keep
the
doors
locked
in
his
absence
,
and
to
open
to
nobody
but
himself
on
pain
of
dismissal
,
followed
him
into
the
blustering
darkness
out
of
doors
.
  
<EOS>
The
way
was
wet
and
dismal
,
and
the
night
so
black
,
that
if
Mr
Willet
had
been
his
own
pilot
,
he
would
have
walked
into
a
deep
horsepond
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
his
own
house
,
and
would
certainly
have
terminated
his
career
in
that
ignoble
sphere
of
action
.
 
<EOS>
But
Hugh
,
who
had
a
sight
as
keen
as
any
hawk
's
,
and
,
apart
from
that
endowment
,
could
have
found
his
way
blindfold
to
any
place
within
a
dozen
miles
,
dragged
old
John
along
,
quite
deaf
to
his
remonstrances
,
and
took
his
own
course
without
the
slightest
reference
to
,
or
notice
of
,
his
master
.
 
<EOS>
So
they
made
head
against
the
wind
as
they
best
could
;
<EOS>
Hugh
crushing
the
wet
grass
beneath
his
heavy
tread
,
and
stalking
on
after
his
ordinary
savage
fashion
;
John
Willet
following
at
arm
's
length
,
picking
his
steps
,
and
looking
about
him
,
now
for
bogs
and
ditches
,
and
now
for
such
stray
ghosts
as
might
be
wandering
abroad
,
with
looks
of
as
much
dismay
and
uneasiness
as
his
immovable
face
was
capable
of
expressing
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
they
stood
upon
the
broad
gravel
-
walk
before
the
Warren
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
The
building
was
profoundly
dark
,
and
none
were
moving
near
it
save
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
From
one
solitary
turret
-
chamber
,
however
,
there
shone
a
ray
of
light
;
and
towards
this
speck
of
comfort
in
the
cold
,
cheerless
,
silent
scene
,
Mr
Willet
bade
his
pilot
lead
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
old
room
,
"
said
John
,
looking
timidly
upward
;
"
Mr
Reuben
's
own
apartment
<EOS>
,
God
be
with
us
!
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
his
brother
likes
to
sit
there
,
so
late
at
night
---
on
this
night
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
where
else
should
he
sit
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Hugh
,
holding
the
lantern
to
his
breast
,
to
keep
the
candle
from
the
wind
,
while
he
trimmed
it
with
his
fingers
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
snug
enough
,
an't
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Snug
!
"
said
John
indignantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
comfortable
idea
of
snugness
<EOS>
,
you
have
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
what
was
done
in
that
room
,
you
ruffian
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
is
it
the
worse
for
that
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Hugh
,
looking
into
John
's
fat
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
Does
it
keep
out
the
rain
,
and
snow
,
and
wind
,
the
less
for
that
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
less
warm
or
dry
,
because
a
man
was
killed
there
?
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
 
Never
believe
it
,
master
.
 
<EOS>
One
man
's
no
such
matter
as
that
comes
to
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Willet
fixed
his
dull
eyes
on
his
follower
,
and
began
---
by
a
species
of
inspiration
---
to
think
it
just
barely
possible
that
he
was
something
of
a
dangerous
character
,
and
that
it
might
be
advisable
to
get
rid
of
him
one
of
these
days
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
too
prudent
to
say
anything
,
with
the
journey
home
before
him
;
and
therefore
turned
to
the
iron
gate
before
which
this
brief
dialogue
had
passed
,
and
pulled
the
handle
of
the
bell
that
hung
beside
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
turret
in
which
the
light
appeared
being
at
one
corner
of
the
building
,
and
only
divided
from
the
path
by
one
of
the
garden
-
walks
,
upon
which
this
gate
opened
<EOS>
,
Mr
Haredale
threw
up
the
window
directly
,
and
demanded
who
was
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
Begging
pardon
,
sir
,
"
said
John
,
"
I
knew
you
sat
up
late
,
and
made
bold
to
come
round
,
having
a
word
to
say
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Willet
---
is
it
not
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Of
the
Maypole
---
at
your
service
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
closed
the
window
,
and
withdrew
.
 
<EOS>
He
presently
appeared
at
a
door
in
the
bottom
of
the
turret
,
and
coming
across
the
garden
-
walk
,
unlocked
the
gate
and
let
them
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
late
visitor
,
Willet
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
to
speak
of
,
sir
,
"
said
John
;
"
an
idle
tale
<EOS>
,
I
thought
you
ought
to
know
of
;
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
your
man
go
forward
with
the
lantern
,
and
give
me
your
hand
.
<EOS>
The
stairs
are
crooked
and
narrow
.
 
<EOS>
Gently
with
your
light
,
friend
.
<EOS>
You
swing
it
like
a
censer
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
,
who
had
already
reached
the
turret
,
held
it
more
steadily
,
and
ascended
first
,
turning
round
from
time
to
time
to
shed
his
light
downward
on
the
steps
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
following
next
,
eyed
his
lowering
face
with
no
great
favour
;
and
Hugh
,
looking
down
on
him
,
returned
his
glances
with
interest
,
as
they
climbed
the
winding
stairs
.
  
<EOS>
It
terminated
in
a
little
ante
-
room
adjoining
that
from
which
they
had
seen
the
light
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
entered
first
,
and
led
the
way
through
it
into
the
latter
chamber
,
where
he
seated
himself
at
a
writing
-
table
from
which
he
had
risen
when
they
had
rung
the
bell
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
"
he
said
,
beckoning
to
old
John
,
who
remained
bowing
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
you
,
friend
,
"
he
added
hastily
to
Hugh
,
who
entered
also
.
 
<EOS>
"
Willet
,
why
do
you
bring
that
fellow
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
sir
,
"
returned
John
,
elevating
his
eyebrows
,
and
lowering
his
voice
to
the
tone
in
which
the
question
had
been
asked
him
,
"
he
's
a
good
guard
,
you
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
be
too
sure
of
that
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
looking
towards
him
as
he
spoke
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
doubt
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
an
evil
eye
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
imagination
in
his
eye
,
"
returned
Mr
Willet
,
glancing
over
his
shoulder
at
the
organ
in
question
,
"
certainly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
good
there
,
be
assured
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wait
in
that
little
room
,
friend
,
and
close
the
door
between
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
and
with
a
disdainful
look
,
which
showed
,
either
that
he
had
overheard
,
or
that
he
guessed
the
purport
of
their
whispering
,
did
as
he
was
told
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
was
shut
out
,
Mr
Haredale
turned
to
John
,
and
bade
him
go
on
with
what
he
had
to
say
,
but
not
to
speak
too
loud
,
for
there
were
quick
ears
yonder
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
cautioned
,
Mr
Willet
,
in
an
oily
whisper
,
recited
all
that
he
had
heard
and
said
that
night
;
laying
particular
stress
upon
his
own
sagacity
,
upon
his
great
regard
for
the
family
,
and
upon
his
solicitude
for
their
peace
of
mind
and
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
The
story
moved
his
auditor
much
more
than
he
had
expected
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
often
changed
his
attitude
,
rose
and
paced
the
room
,
returned
again
,
desired
him
to
repeat
,
as
nearly
as
he
could
,
the
very
words
that
Solomon
had
used
,
and
gave
so
many
other
signs
of
being
disturbed
and
ill
at
ease
,
that
even
Mr
Willet
was
surprised
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
did
quite
right
,
"
he
said
,
at
the
end
of
a
long
conversation
,
"
to
bid
them
keep
this
story
secret
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
foolish
fancy
on
the
part
of
this
weak
-
brained
man
,
bred
in
his
fears
and
superstition
.
<EOS>
But
Miss
Haredale
,
though
she
would
know
it
to
be
so
,
would
be
disturbed
by
it
if
it
reached
her
ears
;
it
is
too
nearly
connected
with
a
subject
very
painful
to
us
all
,
to
be
heard
with
indifference
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
most
prudent
,
and
have
laid
me
under
a
great
obligation
.
 
<EOS>
I
thank
you
very
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
equal
to
John
's
most
sanguine
expectations
;
but
he
would
have
preferred
Mr
Haredale
's
looking
at
him
when
he
spoke
,
as
if
he
really
did
thank
him
,
to
his
walking
up
and
down
,
speaking
by
fits
and
starts
,
often
stopping
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
,
moving
hurriedly
on
again
,
like
one
distracted
,
and
seeming
almost
unconscious
of
what
he
said
or
did
.
  
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
was
his
manner
;
and
it
was
so
embarrassing
to
John
that
he
sat
quite
passive
for
a
long
time
,
not
knowing
what
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
he
rose
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
stared
at
him
for
a
moment
as
though
he
had
quite
forgotten
his
being
present
,
then
shook
hands
with
him
,
and
opened
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Hugh
,
who
was
,
or
feigned
to
be
,
fast
asleep
on
the
ante
-
chamber
floor
,
sprang
up
on
their
entrance
,
and
throwing
his
cloak
about
him
,
grasped
his
stick
and
lantern
,
and
prepared
to
descend
the
stairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stay
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
this
man
drink
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Drink
!
 
<EOS>
He
'd
drink
the
Thames
up
,
if
it
was
strong
enough
,
sir
,
replied
John
Willet
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
'll
have
something
when
he
gets
home
.
<EOS>
He
's
better
without
it
,
now
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
.
 
<EOS>
Half
the
distance
is
done
,
"
said
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
a
hard
master
you
are
!
 
<EOS>
I
shall
go
home
the
better
for
one
glassful
,
halfway
.
<EOS>
Come
!
"
  
<EOS>
As
John
made
no
reply
,
Mr
Haredale
brought
out
a
glass
of
liquor
,
and
gave
it
to
Hugh
,
who
,
as
he
took
it
in
his
hand
,
threw
part
of
it
upon
the
floor
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
by
splashing
your
drink
about
a
gentleman
's
house
,
sir
?
"
said
John
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
drinking
a
toast
,
"
Hugh
rejoined
,
holding
the
glass
above
his
head
,
and
fixing
his
eyes
on
Mr
Haredale
's
face
;
"
a
toast
to
this
house
and
its
master
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
that
he
muttered
something
to
himself
,
and
drank
the
rest
,
and
setting
down
the
glass
,
preceded
them
without
another
word
.
  
<EOS>
John
was
a
good
deal
scandalised
by
this
observance
,
but
seeing
that
Mr
Haredale
took
little
heed
of
what
Hugh
said
or
did
,
and
that
his
thoughts
were
otherwise
employed
,
he
offered
no
apology
,
and
went
in
silence
down
the
stairs
,
across
the
walk
,
and
through
the
garden
-
gate
.
 
<EOS>
They
stopped
upon
the
outer
side
for
Hugh
to
hold
the
light
while
Mr
Haredale
locked
it
on
the
inner
;
and
then
John
saw
with
wonder
(
as
he
often
afterwards
related
)
,
that
he
was
very
pale
,
and
that
his
face
had
changed
so
much
and
grown
so
haggard
since
their
entrance
,
that
he
almost
seemed
another
man
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
in
the
open
road
again
,
and
John
Willet
was
walking
on
behind
his
escort
,
as
he
had
come
,
thinking
very
steadily
of
what
be
had
just
now
seen
,
when
Hugh
drew
him
suddenly
aside
,
and
almost
at
the
same
instant
three
horsemen
swept
past
---
the
nearest
brushed
his
shoulder
even
then
---
who
,
checking
their
steeds
as
suddenly
as
they
could
,
stood
still
,
and
waited
for
their
coming
up
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
35
    
When
John
Willet
saw
that
the
horsemen
wheeled
smartly
round
,
and
drew
up
three
abreast
in
the
narrow
road
,
waiting
for
him
and
his
man
to
join
them
,
it
occurred
to
him
with
unusual
precipitation
that
they
must
be
highwaymen
;
and
had
Hugh
been
armed
with
a
blunderbuss
,
in
place
of
his
stout
cudgel
,
he
would
certainly
have
ordered
him
to
fire
it
off
at
a
venture
,
and
would
,
while
the
word
of
command
was
obeyed
,
have
consulted
his
own
personal
safety
in
immediate
flight
.
 
<EOS>
Under
the
circumstances
of
disadvantage
,
however
,
in
which
he
and
his
guard
were
placed
,
he
deemed
it
prudent
to
adopt
a
different
style
of
generalship
,
and
therefore
whispered
his
attendant
to
address
them
in
the
most
peaceable
and
courteous
terms
.
 
<EOS>
By
way
of
acting
up
to
the
spirit
and
letter
of
this
instruction
,
Hugh
stepped
forward
,
and
flourishing
his
staff
before
the
very
eyes
of
the
rider
nearest
to
him
,
demanded
roughly
what
he
and
his
fellows
meant
by
so
nearly
galloping
over
them
,
and
why
they
scoured
the
king
's
highway
at
that
late
hour
of
night
.
  
<EOS>
The
man
whom
be
addressed
was
beginning
an
angry
reply
in
the
same
strain
,
when
be
was
checked
by
the
horseman
in
the
centre
,
who
,
interposing
with
an
air
of
authority
,
inquired
in
a
somewhat
loud
but
not
harsh
or
unpleasant
voice
:
  
"
Pray
,
is
this
the
London
road
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
follow
it
right
,
it
is
,
"
replied
Hugh
roughly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
brother
,
"
said
the
same
person
,
"
you
're
but
a
churlish
Englishman
,
if
Englishman
you
be
---
<EOS>
which
I
should
much
doubt
but
for
your
tongue
.
 
<EOS>
Your
companion
,
I
am
sure
,
will
answer
me
more
civilly
.
 
<EOS>
How
say
you
,
friend
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
it
IS
the
London
road
,
sir
,
"
answered
John
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
wish
,
"
he
added
in
a
subdued
voice
,
as
he
turned
to
Hugh
,
"
that
you
was
in
any
other
road
,
you
vagabond
.
 
<EOS>
Are
you
tired
of
your
life
,
sir
,
that
you
go
a
-
trying
to
provoke
three
great
neck
-
or
-
nothing
chaps
,
that
could
keep
on
running
over
us
,
back'ards
and
for'ards
,
till
we
was
dead
,
and
then
take
our
bodies
up
behind
'em
,
and
drown
us
ten
miles
off
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
far
is
it
to
London
?
"
inquired
the
same
speaker
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
from
here
,
sir
,
"
answered
John
,
persuasively
,
"
it
's
thirteen
very
easy
mile
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
adjective
was
thrown
in
,
as
an
inducement
to
the
travellers
to
ride
away
with
all
speed
;
but
instead
of
having
the
desired
effect
,
it
elicited
from
the
same
person
,
the
remark
,
"
Thirteen
miles
!
<EOS>
That
's
a
long
distance
!
"
<EOS>
which
was
followed
by
a
short
pause
of
indecision
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
"
are
there
any
inns
hereabouts
?
"
 
<EOS>
At
the
word
"
inns
,
"
John
plucked
up
his
spirit
in
a
surprising
manner
;
his
fears
rolled
off
like
smoke
;
all
the
landlord
stirred
within
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
are
no
inns
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Willet
,
with
a
strong
emphasis
on
the
plural
number
;
"
but
there
's
a
Inn
---
one
Inn
---
the
Maypole
Inn
.
<EOS>
That
's
a
Inn
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
see
the
like
of
that
Inn
often
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
keep
it
,
perhaps
?
"
said
the
horseman
,
smiling
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
sir
,
"
replied
John
,
greatly
wondering
how
he
had
found
this
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
far
is
the
Maypole
from
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
About
a
mile
"
---
John
was
going
to
add
that
it
was
the
easiest
mile
in
all
the
world
,
when
the
third
rider
,
who
had
hitherto
kept
a
little
in
the
rear
,
suddenly
interposed
:
  
"
And
have
you
one
excellent
bed
,
landlord
?
 
<EOS>
Hem
!
 
<EOS>
A
bed
that
you
can
recommend
---
a
bed
that
you
are
sure
is
well
aired
---
a
bed
that
has
been
slept
in
by
some
perfectly
respectable
and
unexceptionable
person
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
do
n't
take
in
no
tagrag
and
bobtail
at
our
house
,
sir
,
"
answered
John
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
as
to
the
bed
itself
---
"
  
"
Say
,
as
to
three
beds
,
"
interposed
the
gentleman
who
had
spoken
before
;
"
for
we
shall
want
three
if
we
stay
,
though
my
friend
only
speaks
of
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
my
lord
;
you
are
too
good
,
you
are
too
kind
;
but
your
life
is
of
far
too
much
importance
to
the
nation
in
these
portentous
times
,
to
be
placed
upon
a
level
with
one
so
useless
and
so
poor
as
mine
.
 
<EOS>
A
great
cause
,
my
lord
,
a
mighty
cause
,
depends
on
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
its
leader
and
its
champion
,
its
advanced
guard
and
its
van
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
cause
of
our
altars
and
our
homes
,
our
country
and
our
faith
.
 
<EOS>
Let
ME
sleep
on
a
chair
---
the
carpet
---
anywhere
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
will
repine
if
I
take
cold
or
fever
.
 
<EOS>
Let
John
Grueby
pass
the
night
beneath
the
open
sky
---
no
one
will
repine
for
HIM
.
 
<EOS>
But
forty
thousand
men
of
this
our
island
in
the
wave
(
exclusive
of
women
and
children
)
rivet
their
eyes
and
thoughts
on
Lord
George
Gordon
;
and
every
day
,
from
the
rising
up
of
the
sun
to
the
going
down
of
the
same
,
pray
for
his
health
and
vigour
.
 
<EOS>
My
lord
,
"
said
the
speaker
,
rising
in
his
stirrups
,
"
it
is
a
glorious
cause
,
and
must
not
be
forgotten
.
 
<EOS>
My
lord
,
it
is
a
mighty
cause
,
and
must
not
be
endangered
.
 
<EOS>
My
lord
,
it
is
a
holy
cause
,
and
must
not
be
deserted

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
IS
a
holy
cause
,
"
exclaimed
his
lordship
,
lifting
up
his
hat
with
great
solemnity
.
 
<EOS>
"
Amen

in

tone

mild
reproof

Amen

sitting
like

on

horse

<EOS>
"
And
do
not
YOU
say
Amen

likewise
?
"
  
<EOS>
To
which
John
Grueby
made
no
reply
at
all
,
but
sat
looking
straight
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
surprise
me
,
Grueby
,
"
said
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
a
crisis
like
the
present
,
when
Queen
Elizabeth
,
that
maiden
monarch
,
weeps
within
her
tomb
,
and
Bloody
Mary
,
with
a
brow
of
gloom
and
shadow
,
stalks
triumphant
---
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
,
sir
,
"
cied
the
man
,
gruffly
,
"
where
's
the
use
of
talking
of
Bloody
Mary
,
under
such
circumstances
as
the
present
,
when
my
lord
's
wet
through
,
and
tired
with
hard
riding
?
 
<EOS>
Let
's
either
go
on
to
London
,
sir
,
or
put
up
at
once
;
or
that
unfort'nate
Bloody
Mary
will
have
more
to
answer
for
---
and
she
's
done
a
deal
more
harm
in
her
grave
than
she
ever
did
in
her
lifetime
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
  
By
this
time
Mr
Willet
,
who
had
never
beard
so
many
words
spoken
together
at
one
time
,
or
delivered
with
such
volubility
and
emphasis
as
by
the
long
-
winded
gentleman
;
and
whose
brain
,
being
wholly
unable
to
sustain
or
compass
them
,
had
quite
given
itself
up
for
lost
;
recovered
so
far
as
to
observe
that
there
was
ample
accommodation
at
the
Maypole
for
all
the
party
:
good
beds
;
neat
wines
;
excellent
entertainment
for
man
and
beast
;
private
rooms
for
large
and
small
parties
;
dinners
dressed
upon
the
shortest
notice
;
choice
stabling
,
and
a
lock
-
up
coach
-
house
;
and
,
in
short
,
to
run
over
such
recommendatory
scraps
of
language
as
were
painted
up
on
various
portions
of
the
building
,
and
which
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
some
forty
years
he
had
learnt
to
repeat
with
tolerable
correctness
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
considering
whether
it
was
at
all
possible
to
insert
any
novel
sentences
to
the
same
purpose
,
when
the
gentleman
who
had
spoken
first
,
turning
to
him
of
the
long
wind
,
exclaimed
,
"
What
say
you
,
Gashford
?
 
<EOS>
Shall
we
tarry
at
this
house
he
speaks
of
,
or
press
forward
?
 
<EOS>
You
shall
decide
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
submit
,
my
lord
,
then
,
"
returned
the
person
he
appealed
to
,
in
a
silky
tone
,
"
that
your
health
and
spirits
---
so
important
,
under
Providence
,
to
our
great
cause
,
our
pure
and
truthful
cause
"
---
 
here
his
lordship
pulled
off
his
hat
again
,
though
it
was
raining
hard
---
"
require
refreshment
and
repose
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Go
on
before
,
landlord
,
and
show
the
way
,
"
said
Lord
George
Gordon
;
"
we
will
follow
at
a
footpace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
'll
give
me
leave
,
my
lord
,
"
said
John
Grueby
,
in
a
low
voice
,
"
I
'll
change
my
proper
place
,
and
ride
before
you
.
 
<EOS>
The
looks
of
the
landlord
's
friend
are
not
over
honest
,
and
it
may
be
as
well
to
be
cautious
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
John
Grueby
is
quite
right
,
"
interposed
Mr
Gashford
,
falling
back
hastily
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
a
life
so
precious
as
yours
must
not
be
put
in
peril
.
 
<EOS>
Go
forward
,
John
,
by
all
means
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
have
any
reason
to
suspect
the
fellow
,
blow
his
brains
out
.
"
  
<EOS>
John
made
no
answer
,
but
looking
straight
before
him
,
as
his
custom
seemed
to
be
when
the
secretary
spoke
,
bade
Hugh
push
on
,
and
followed
close
behind
him
.
 
<EOS>
Then
came
his
lordship
,
with
Mr
Willet
at
his
bridle
rein
;
and
,
last
of
all
,
his
lordship
's
secretary
---
for
that
,
it
seemed
,
was
Gashford
's
office
.
  
<EOS>
Hugh
strode
briskly
on
,
often
looking
back
at
the
servant
,
whose
horse
was
close
upon
his
heels
,
and
glancing
with
a
leer
at
his
bolster
case
of
pistols
,
by
which
he
seemed
to
set
great
store
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
square
-
built
,
strong
-
made
,
bull
-
necked
fellow
,
of
the
true
English
breed
;
and
as
Hugh
measured
him
with
his
eye
,
he
measured
Hugh
,
regarding
him
meanwhile
with
a
look
of
bluff
disdain
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
much
older
than
the
Maypole
man
,
being
to
all
appearance
five
-
and
-
forty
;
but
was
one
of
those
self
-
possessed
,
hard
-
headed
,
imperturbable
fellows
,
who
,
if
they
are
ever
beaten
at
fisticuffs
,
or
other
kind
of
warfare
,
never
know
it
,
and
go
on
coolly
till
they
win
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
led
you
wrong
now
,
"
said
Hugh
,
tauntingly
,
"
<EOS>
you
'd
---
ha
ha
ha
!
---
 
<EOS>
you
'd
shoot
me
through
the
head
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
John
Grueby
took
no
more
notice
of
this
remark
than
if
he
had
been
deaf
and
Hugh
dumb
;
but
kept
riding
on
quite
comfortably
,
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
horizon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
ever
try
a
fall
with
a
man
when
you
were
young
,
master
?
"
said
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Can
you
make
any
play
at
single
-
stick
?
"
  
<EOS>
John
Grueby
looked
at
him
sideways
with
the
same
contented
air
,
but
deigned
not
a
word
in
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
---
Like
this
?
"
said
Hugh
,
giving
his
cudgel
one
of
those
skilful
flourishes
,
in
which
the
rustic
of
that
time
delighted
.
 
<EOS>
"
Whoop
!
"
  
"
<EOS>
---
Or
that
,
"
returned
John
Grueby
,
beating
down
his
guard
with
his
whip
,
and
striking
him
on
the
head
with
its
butt
end
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
played
a
little
once
.
 
<EOS>
You
wear
your
hair
too
long
;
I
should
have
cracked
your
crown
if
it
had
been
a
little
shorter
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
pretty
smart
,
loud
-
sounding
rap
,
as
it
was
,
and
evidently
astonished
Hugh
;
who
,
for
the
moment
,
seemed
disposed
to
drag
his
new
acquaintance
from
his
saddle
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
face
betokening
neither
malice
,
triumph
,
rage
,
nor
any
lingering
idea
that
he
had
given
him
offence
;
his
eyes
gazing
steadily
in
the
old
direction
,
and
his
manner
being
as
careless
and
composed
as
if
he
had
merely
brushed
away
a
fly
;
Hugh
was
so
puzzled
,
and
so
disposed
to
look
upon
him
as
a
customer
of
almost
supernatural
toughness
,
that
he
merely
laughed
,
and
cried
"
Well
done
!
"
<EOS>
then
,
sheering
off
a
little
,
led
the
way
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
Before
the
lapse
of
many
minutes
the
party
halted
at
the
Maypole
door
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
George
and
his
secretary
quickly
dismounting
,
gave
their
horses
to
their
servant
,
who
,
under
the
guidance
of
Hugh
,
repaired
to
the
stables
.
 
<EOS>
Right
glad
to
escape
from
the
inclemency
of
the
night
,
they
followed
Mr
Willet
into
the
common
room
,
and
stood
warming
themselves
and
drying
their
clothes
before
the
cheerful
fire
,
while
he
busied
himself
with
such
orders
and
preparations
as
his
guest
's
high
quality
required
.
  
<EOS>
As
he
bustled
in
and
out
of
the
room
,
intent
on
these
arrangements
,
he
had
an
opportunity
of
observing
the
two
travellers
,
of
whom
,
as
yet
,
he
knew
nothing
but
the
voice
.
 
<EOS>
The
lord
,
the
great
personage
who
did
the
Maypole
so
much
honour
,
was
about
the
middle
height
,
of
a
slender
make
,
and
sallow
complexion
,
with
an
aquiline
nose
,
and
long
hair
of
a
reddish
brown
,
combed
perfectly
straight
and
smooth
about
his
ears
,
and
slightly
powdered
,
but
without
the
faintest
vestige
of
a
curl
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
attired
,
under
his
greatcoat
,
in
a
full
suit
of
black
,
quite
free
from
any
ornament
,
and
of
the
most
precise
and
sober
cut
.
 
<EOS>
The
gravity
of
his
dress
,
together
with
a
certain
lankness
of
cheek
and
stiffness
of
deportment
,
added
nearly
ten
years
to
his
age
,
but
his
figure
was
that
of
one
not
yet
past
thirty
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
stood
musing
in
the
red
glow
of
the
fire
,
it
was
striking
to
observe
his
very
bright
large
eye
,
which
betrayed
a
restlessness
of
thought
and
purpose
,
singularly
at
variance
with
the
studied
composure
and
sobriety
of
his
mien
,
and
with
his
quaint
and
sad
apparel
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
nothing
harsh
or
cruel
in
its
expression
;
neither
had
his
face
,
which
was
thin
and
mild
,
and
wore
an
air
of
melancholy
;
but
it
was
suggestive
of
an
indefinable
uneasiness
;
which
infected
those
who
looked
upon
him
,
and
filled
them
with
a
kind
of
pity
for
the
man
:
<EOS>
though
why
it
did
so
,
they
would
have
had
some
trouble
to
explain
.
  
<EOS>
Gashford
,
the
secretary
,
was
taller
,
angularly
made
,
high
-
shouldered
,
bony
,
and
ungraceful
.
 
<EOS>
His
dress
,
in
imitation
of
his
superior
,
was
demure
and
staid
in
the
extreme
;
his
manner
,
formal
and
constrained
.
 
<EOS>
This
gentleman
had
an
overhanging
brow
,
great
hands
and
feet
and
ears
,
and
a
pair
of
eyes
that
seemed
to
have
made
an
unnatural
retreat
into
his
head
,
and
to
have
dug
themselves
a
cave
to
hide
in
.
 
<EOS>
His
manner
was
smooth
and
humble
,
but
very
sly
and
slinking
.
 
<EOS>
He
wore
the
aspect
of
a
man
who
was
always
lying
in
wait
for
something
that
WOULDN'T
come
to
pass
;
but
he
looked
patient
---
very
patient
---
and
fawned
like
a
spaniel
dog
.
 
<EOS>
Even
now
,
while
he
warmed
and
rubbed
his
hands
before
the
blaze
,
he
had
the
air
of
one
who
only
presumed
to
enjoy
it
in
his
degree
as
a
commoner
;
and
though
he
knew
his
lord
was
not
regarding
him
,
he
looked
into
his
face
from
time
to
time
,
and
with
a
meek
and
deferential
manner
,
smiled
as
if
for
practice
.
  
<EOS>
Such
were
the
guests
whom
old
John
Willet
,
with
a
fixed
and
leaden
eye
,
surveyed
a
hundred
times
,
and
to
whom
he
now
advanced
with
a
state
candlestick
in
each
hand
,
beseeching
them
to
follow
him
into
a
worthier
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
my
lord
,
"
said
John
<EOS>
---
it
is
odd
enough
,
but
certain
people
seem
to
have
as
great
a
pleasure
in
pronouncing
titles
as
their
owners
have
in
wearing
them
---
"
this
room
,
my
lord
,
is
n't
at
all
the
sort
of
place
for
your
lordship
,
and
I
have
to
beg
your
lordship
's
pardon
for
keeping
you
here
,
my
lord
,
one
minute
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
this
address
,
John
ushered
them
upstairs
into
the
state
apartment
,
which
,
like
many
other
things
of
state
,
was
cold
and
comfortless
.
 
<EOS>
Their
own
footsteps
,
reverberating
through
the
spacious
room
,
struck
upon
their
hearing
with
a
hollow
sound
;
and
its
damp
and
chilly
atmosphere
was
rendered
doubly
cheerless
by
contrast
with
the
homely
warmth
they
had
deserted
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
of
no
use
,
however
,
to
propose
a
return
to
the
place
they
had
quitted
,
for
the
preparations
went
on
so
briskly
that
there
was
no
time
to
stop
them
.
 
<EOS>
John
,
with
the
tall
candlesticks
in
his
hands
,
bowed
them
up
to
the
fireplace
;
Hugh
,
striding
in
with
a
lighted
brand
and
pile
of
firewood
,
cast
it
down
upon
the
hearth
,
and
set
it
in
a
blaze
;
John
Grueby
(
who
had
a
great
blue
cockade
in
his
hat
,
which
he
appeared
to
despise
mightily
)
brought
in
the
portmanteau
he
had
carried
on
his
horse
,
and
placed
it
on
the
floor
;
and
presently
all
three
were
busily
engaged
in
drawing
out
the
screen
,
laying
the
cloth
,
inspecting
the
beds
,
lighting
fires
in
the
bedrooms
,
expediting
the
supper
,
and
making
everything
as
cosy
and
as
snug
as
might
be
,
on
so
short
a
notice
.
 
<EOS>
In
less
than
an
hour
's
time
,
supper
had
been
served
,
and
ate
,
and
cleared
away
;
and
Lord
George
and
his
secretary
,
with
slippered
feet
,
and
legs
stretched
out
before
the
fire
,
sat
over
some
hot
mulled
wine
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
ends
,
my
lord
,
"
said
Gashford
,
filling
his
glass
with
great
complacency
,
"
the
blessed
work
of
a
most
blessed
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
of
a
blessed
yesterday
,
"
said
his
lordship
,
raising
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
---
and
here
the
secretary
clasped
his
hands
---
"
a
blessed
yesterday
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
The
Protestants
of
Suffolk
are
godly
men
and
true
.
 
<EOS>
Though
others
of
our
countrymen
have
lost
their
way
in
darkness
,
even
as
we
,
my
lord
,
did
lose
our
road
to
-
night
,
theirs
is
the
light
and
glory
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
I
move
them
,
Gashford
?
"
said
Lord
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
Move
them
,
my
lord
!
 
<EOS>
Move
them
!
 
<EOS>
They
cried
to
be
led
on
against
the
Papists
,
they
vowed
a
dreadful
vengeance
on
their
heads
<EOS>
,
they
roared
like
men
possessed
---
"
  
"
But
not
by
devils
,
"
said
his
lord
.
  
<EOS>
"
By
devils
!
<EOS>
my
lord
!
 
<EOS>
By
angels
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
---
oh
surely
---
by
angels
,
no
doubt
,
"
said
Lord
George
,
thrusting
his
hands
into
his
pockets
,
taking
them
out
again
to
bite
his
nails
,
and
looking
uncomfortably
at
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
by
angels
---
eh
Gashford
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
doubt
it
,
my
lord
?
"
said
the
secretary
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
---
No
,
"
returned
his
lord
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
 
<EOS>
Why
should
I
?
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
would
be
decidedly
irreligious
to
doubt
it
---
would
n't
it
,
Gashford
?
<EOS>
Though
there
certainly
were
,
"
he
added
,
without
waiting
for
an
answer
,
"
some
plaguy
ill
-
looking
characters
among
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
you
warmed
,
"
said
the
secretary
,
looking
sharply
at
the
other
's
downcast
eyes
,
which
brightened
slowly
as
he
spoke
;
"
when
you
warmed
into
that
noble
outbreak
;
when
you
told
them
that
you
were
never
of
the
lukewarm
or
the
timid
tribe
,
and
bade
them
take
heed
that
they
were
prepared
to
follow
one
who
would
lead
them
on
,
though
to
the
very
death
;
when
you
spoke
of
a
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
men
across
the
Scottish
border
who
would
take
their
own
redress
at
any
time
,
if
it
were
not
conceded
;
when
you
cried
"
Perish
the
Pope
and
all
his
base
adherents
;
the
penal
laws
against
them
shall
never
be
repealed
while
Englishmen
have
hearts
and
hands
"
---
and
waved
your
own
and
touched
your
sword
;
and
when
they
cried
"
No
Popery
!
"
<EOS>
and
you
cried
"
<EOS>
No
;
not
even
if
we
wade
in
blood
,
"
and
they
threw
up
their
hats
and
cried
"
Hurrah
!
<EOS>
not
even
if
we
wade
in
blood
;
No
Popery
!
 
<EOS>
Lord
George
!
 
<EOS>
Down
with
the
Papists
---
 
<EOS>
Vengeance
on
their
heads
:
"
when
this
was
said
and
done
,
and
a
word
from
you
,
my
lord
,
could
raise
or
still
the
tumult
---
ah
!
<EOS>
then
I
felt
what
greatness
was
indeed
,
and
thought
,
When
was
there
ever
power
like
this
of
Lord
George
Gordon
's
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
great
power
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
right
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
great
power
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
with
sparkling
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
---
dear
Gashford
---
did
I
really
say
all
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
much
more
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
secretary
,
looking
upwards
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
how
much
more
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
told
them
what
you
say
,
about
the
one
hundred
and
forty
thousand
men
in
Scotland
,
did
I
!
"
<EOS>
he
asked
with
evident
delight
.
<EOS>
"
That
was
bold
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Our
cause
is
boldness
.
 
<EOS>
Truth
is
always
bold
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Certainly
.
 
<EOS>
So
is
religion
.
 
<EOS>
She
's
bold
,
Gashford
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
true
religion
is
,
my
lord
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
that
's
ours
,
"
he
rejoined
,
moving
uneasily
in
his
seat
,
and
biting
his
nails
as
though
he
would
pare
them
to
the
quick
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
can
be
no
doubt
of
ours
being
the
true
one
.
 
<EOS>
You
feel
as
certain
of
that
as
I
do
,
Gashford
,
do
n't
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Does
my
lord
ask
ME
,
"
whined
Gashford
,
drawing
his
chair
nearer
with
an
injured
air
,
and
laying
his
broad
flat
hand
upon
the
table
;
"
ME
,
"
he
repeated
,
bending
the
dark
hollows
of
his
eyes
upon
him
with
an
unwholesome
smile
,
"
who
,
stricken
by
the
magic
of
his
eloquence
in
Scotland
but
a
year
ago
,
abjured
the
errors
of
the
Romish
church
,
and
clung
to
him
as
one
whose
timely
hand
had
plucked
me
from
a
pit
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
True
.
 
<EOS>
No
---
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
---
I
did
n't
mean
it
,
"
replied
the
other
,
shaking
him
by
the
hand
,
rising
from
his
seat
,
and
pacing
restlessly
about
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
proud
thing
to
lead
the
people
,
Gashford
,
"
he
added
as
he
made
a
sudden
halt
.
  
<EOS>
"
By
force
of
reason
too
,
"
returned
the
pliant
secretary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
to
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
They
may
cough
and
jeer
,
and
groan
in
Parliament
,
and
call
me
fool
and
madman
,
but
which
of
them
can
raise
this
human
sea
and
make
it
swell
and
roar
at
pleasure
?
 
<EOS>
Not
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
one
,
"
repeated
Gashford
.
  
<EOS>
"
Which
of
them
can
say
for
his
honesty
,
what
I
can
say
for
mine
;
which
of
them
has
refused
a
minister
's
bribe
of
one
thousand
pounds
a
year
,
to
resign
his
seat
in
favour
of
another
?
 
<EOS>
Not
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
one
,
"
repeated
Gashford
again
---
taking
the
lion
's
share
of
the
mulled
wine
between
whiles
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
as
we
are
honest
,
true
,
and
in
a
sacred
cause
,
Gashford
,
"
said
Lord
George
with
a
heightened
colour
and
in
a
louder
voice
,
as
he
laid
his
fevered
hand
upon
his
shoulder
,
"
and
are
the
only
men
who
regard
the
mass
of
people
out
of
doors
,
or
are
regarded
by
them
,
we
will
uphold
them
to
the
last
;
and
will
raise
a
cry
against
these
un
-
English
Papists
which
shall
re
-
echo
through
the
country
,
and
roll
with
a
noise
like
thunder
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
be
worthy
of
the
motto
on
my
coat
of
arms
,
"
Called
and
chosen
and
faithful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Called
,
"
said
the
secretary
,
"
by
Heaven
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Chosen
by
the
people
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Faithful
to
both
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
the
block
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
would
be
difficult
to
convey
an
adequate
idea
of
the
excited
manner
in
which
he
gave
these
answers
to
the
secretary
's
promptings
;
of
the
rapidity
of
his
utterance
,
or
the
violence
of
his
tone
and
gesture
;
in
which
,
struggling
through
his
Puritan
's
demeanour
,
was
something
wild
and
ungovernable
which
broke
through
all
restraint
.
 
<EOS>
For
some
minutes
he
walked
rapidly
up
and
down
the
room
,
then
stopping
suddenly
,
exclaimed
,
  
<EOS>
"
Gashford
---
YOU
moved
them
yesterday
too
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
yes
!
 
<EOS>
You
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shone
with
a
reflected
light
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
the
humble
secretary
,
laying
his
hand
upon
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
my
best
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
did
well
,
"
said
his
master
,
"
and
are
a
great
and
worthy
instrument
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
will
ring
for
John
Grueby
to
carry
the
portmanteau
into
my
room
,
and
will
wait
here
while
I
undress
,
we
will
dispose
of
business
as
usual
,
if
you
're
not
too
tired
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Too
tired
,
my
lord
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
But
this
is
his
consideration
!
 
<EOS>
Christian
from
head
to
foot
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
which
soliloquy
,
the
secretary
tilted
the
jug
,
and
looked
very
hard
into
the
mulled
wine
,
to
see
how
much
remained
.
  
<EOS>
John
Willet
and
John
Grueby
appeared
together
.
 
<EOS>
The
one
bearing
the
great
candlesticks
,
and
the
other
the
portmanteau
,
showed
the
deluded
lord
into
his
chamber
;
and
left
the
secretary
alone
,
to
yawn
and
shake
himself
,
and
finally
to
fall
asleep
before
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Mr
Gashford
sir
,
"
said
John
Grueby
in
his
ear
,
after
what
appeared
to
him
a
moment
of
unconsciousness
;
"
my
lord
's
abed
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
.
 
<EOS>
Very
good
,
John
,
"
was
his
mild
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
John
.
<EOS>
Nobody
need
sit
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
my
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
're
not
a
-
going
to
trouble
your
head
to
-
night
,
or
my
lord
's
head
neither
,
with
anything
more
about
Bloody
Mary
,
"
said
John
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
the
blessed
old
creetur
had
never
been
born
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
said
you
might
go
to
bed
,
John
,
"
returned
the
secretary
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
did
n't
hear
me
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Between
Bloody
Marys
,
and
blue
cockades
,
and
glorious
Queen
Besses
,
and
no
Poperys
,
and
Protestant
associations
,
and
making
of
speeches
,
"
pursued
John
Grueby
,
looking
,
as
usual
,
a
long
way
off
,
and
taking
no
notice
of
this
hint
,
"
my
lord
's
half
off
his
head
.
<EOS>
When
we
go
out
o
'
doors
,
such
a
set
of
ragamuffins
comes
a
-
shouting
after
us
,
"
Gordon
forever
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
that
I
'm
ashamed
of
myself
and
do
n't
know
where
to
look
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
're
indoors
,
they
come
a
-
roaring
and
screaming
about
the
house
like
so
many
devils
;
and
my
lord
instead
of
ordering
them
to
be
drove
away
,
goes
out
into
the
balcony
and
demeans
himself
by
making
speeches
to
'em
,
and
calls
'em
"
Men
of
England
,
"
and
"
Fellow
-
countrymen
,
"
as
if
he
was
fond
of
'em
and
thanked
'em
for
coming
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
make
it
out
,
but
they
're
all
mixed
up
somehow
or
another
with
that
unfort'nate
Bloody
Mary
,
and
call
her
name
out
till
they
're
hoarse
.
 
<EOS>
They
're
all
Protestants
too
---
<EOS>
every
man
and
boy
among
'em
:
and
Protestants
are
very
fond
of
spoons
,
I
find
,
and
silver
-
plate
in
general
,
whenever
area
-
gates
is
left
open
accidentally
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
that
was
the
worst
of
it
,
and
that
no
more
harm
might
be
to
come
;
but
if
you
do
n't
stop
these
ugly
customers
in
time
,
Mr
Gashford
<EOS>
(
and
I
know
you
;
you
're
the
man
that
blows
the
fire
)
,
you
'll
find
'em
grow
a
little
bit
too
strong
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
these
evenings
,
when
the
weather
gets
warmer
and
Protestants
are
thirsty
,
they
'll
be
pulling
London
down
,
---
and
I
never
heard
that
Bloody
Mary
went
as
far
as
THAT
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Gashford
had
vanished
long
ago
,
and
these
remarks
had
been
bestowed
on
empty
air
.
 
<EOS>
Not
at
all
discomposed
by
the
discovery
,
John
Grueby
fixed
his
hat
on
,
wrongside
foremost
that
he
might
be
unconscious
of
the
shadow
of
the
obnoxious
cockade
,
and
withdrew
to
bed
;
shaking
his
head
in
a
very
gloomy
and
prophetic
manner
until
he
reached
his
chamber
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
36
    
Gashford
,
with
a
smiling
face
,
but
still
with
looks
of
profound
deference
and
humility
,
betook
himself
towards
his
master
's
room
,
smoothing
his
hair
down
as
he
went
,
and
humming
a
psalm
tune
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
approached
Lord
George
's
door
,
he
cleared
his
throat
and
hummed
more
vigorously
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
remarkable
contrast
between
this
man
's
occupation
at
the
moment
,
and
the
expression
of
his
countenance
,
which
was
singularly
repulsive
and
malicious
.
 
<EOS>
His
beetling
brow
almost
obscured
his
eyes
;
his
lip
was
curled
contemptuously
;
his
very
shoulders
seemed
to
sneer
in
stealthy
whisperings
with
his
great
flapped
ears
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
<EOS>
he
muttered
softly
,
as
he
peeped
in
at
the
chamber
-
door
.
"
<EOS>
He
seems
to
be
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
Heaven
<EOS>
he
is
!
 
<EOS>
Too
much
watching
,
too
much
care
,
too
much
thought
---
ah
!
<EOS>
Lord
preserve
him
for
a
martyr
!
<EOS>
He
is
a
saint
,
if
ever
saint
drew
breath
on
this
bad
earth
.
"
  
<EOS>
Placing
his
light
upon
a
table
,
he
walked
on
tiptoe
to
the
fire
,
and
sitting
in
a
chair
before
it
with
his
back
towards
the
bed
,
went
on
communing
with
himself
like
one
who
thought
aloud
:
  
"
<EOS>
The
saviour
of
his
country
and
his
country
's
religion
,
the
friend
of
his
poor
countrymen
,
the
enemy
of
the
proud
and
harsh
;
beloved
of
the
rejected
and
oppressed
,
adored
by
forty
thousand
bold
and
loyal
English
hearts
---
what
happy
slumbers
his
should
be
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
here
he
sighed
,
and
warmed
his
hands
,
and
shook
his
head
as
men
do
when
their
hearts
are
full
,
and
heaved
another
sigh
,
and
warmed
his
hands
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Gashford
?
"
said
Lord
George
,
who
was
lying
broad
awake
,
upon
his
side
,
and
had
been
staring
at
him
from
his
entrance
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
---
my
lord
,
"
said
Gashford
,
starting
and
looking
round
as
though
in
great
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
disturbed
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
been
sleeping
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
sleeping
!
"
<EOS>
he
repeated
,
with
assumed
confusion
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
can
I
say
for
having
in
your
presence
<EOS>
given
utterance
to
thoughts
---
<EOS>
but
they
were
sincere
---
they
were
sincere
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
secretary
,
drawing
his
sleeve
in
a
hasty
way
across
his
eyes
;
"
and
why
should
I
regret
your
having
heard
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Gashford
,
"
said
the
poor
lord
,
stretching
out
his
hand
with
manifest
emotion
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
regret
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
love
me
well
,
I
know
---
 
too
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
deserve
such
homage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Gashford
made
no
reply
,
but
grasped
the
hand
and
pressed
it
to
his
lips
.
 
<EOS>
Then
rising
,
and
taking
from
the
trunk
a
little
desk
,
he
placed
it
on
a
table
near
the
fire
,
unlocked
it
with
a
key
he
carried
in
his
pocket
,
sat
down
before
it
,
took
out
a
pen
,
and
,
before
dipping
it
in
the
inkstand
,
sucked
it
---
to
compose
the
fashion
of
his
mouth
perhaps
,
on
which
a
smile
was
hovering
yet
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
do

the

<EOS>
"
I
think
she

the
tall

spoke

"
Mrs

The

nodded
,

rubbed
the
bridge

nose

the
feather
of
his
pen

he
turned

spoke

<EOS>
"
No
fear

said
Gashford
,
with
a
meaning
look
,
which
was
rather
the
involuntary
expression
of
his
own
thoughts
than
intended
as
any
confirmation
of
his
words
,
for
the
other
's
face
was
turned
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
sure
there
is
no
fear
of
that

"
  
<EOS>
"
Nor

he
said
with

more
restless
motion

before

<EOS>
You
feel

sure
of
that
as
I

<EOS>
honestly
,
you

<EOS>
The
secretary
was
beginning
with
"
You
do
not
doubt
,
"
when
the
other
interrupted
him
,
and
impatiently
rejoined
:
  
"
Doubt

<EOS>
No

<EOS>
Who
says
I

he
cried
,
springing
up
in
bed
,
after
repeating
the
phrase
"

country
's
sake
"
to
himself
,
at
least
a
dozen
times
,
"
forsaken
of
God

idolatry

"
<EOS>
To

cried
Gashford
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am

<EOS>

will
be

<EOS>
I
say
again

<EOS>
Do
you

<EOS>
Does

alive

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
secretary
drooped
his
head
with
an
expression
of
perfect
acquiescence
in
anything
that
had
been
said
or
might
be
;
and
Lord
George
gradually
sinking
down
upon
his
pillow
,
fell
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
Although
there
was
something
very
ludicrous
in
his
vehement
manner
,
taken
in
conjunction
with
his
meagre
aspect
and
ungraceful
presence
,
it
would
scarcely
have
provoked
a
smile
in
any
man
of
kindly
feeling
;
or
even
if
it
had
,
he
would
have
felt
sorry
and
almost
angry
with
himself
next
moment
,
for
yielding
to
the
impulse
.
<EOS>
This
lord
was
sincere
in
his
violence
and
in
his
wavering
.
 
<EOS>
A
nature
prone
to
false
enthusiasm
,
and
the
vanity
of
being
a
leader
,
were
the
worst
qualities
apparent
in
his
composition
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
rest
was
weakness
---
sheer
weakness
;
and
it
is
the
unhappy
lot
of
thoroughly
weak
men
,
that
their
very
sympathies
,
affections
,
confidences
---
all
the
qualities
which
in
better
constituted
minds
are
virtues
---
dwindle
into
foibles
,
or
turn
into
downright
vices
.
  
<EOS>
Gashford
,
with
many
a
sly
look
towards
the
bed
,
sat
chuckling
at
his
master
's
folly
,
until
his
deep
and
heavy
breathing
warned
him
that
he
might
retire
.
 
<EOS>
Locking
his
desk
,
and
replacing
it
within
the
trunk
(
but
not
before
he
had
taken
from
a
secret
lining
two
printed
handbills
)
,
he
cautiously
withdrew
;
looking
back
,
as
he
went
,
at
the
pale
face
of
the
slumbering
man
,
above
whose
head
the
dusty
plumes
that
crowned
the
Maypole
couch
,
waved
drearily
and
sadly
as
though
it
were
a
bier
.
  
<EOS>
Stopping
on
the
staircase
to
listen
that
all
was
quiet
,
and
to
take
off
his
shoes
lest
his
footsteps
should
alarm
any
light
sleeper
who
might
be
near
at
hand
,
he
descended
to
the
ground
floor
,
and
thrust
one
of
his
bills
beneath
the
great
door
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
That
done
,
he
crept
softly
back
to
his
own
chamber
,
and
from
the
window
let
another
fall
---
carefully
wrapt
round
a
stone
to
save
it
from
the
wind
---
into
the
yard
below
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
addressed
on
the
back
"
To
every
Protestant

whose
hands
this

come

"
and
bore
within
what
follows
:

<EOS>
Whoever
shall
find
this
letter

will
take
it
as
a
warning
to
join

without
delay
,
the
friends

Lord
George
Gordon
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
great
events
at
hand

and
the
times
are
dangerous
and
troubled

Read
this
carefully
,
keep
it
clean
,
and
drop
it
somewhere
else

"
More

Gashford
as
he
closed
the
window
.

Chapter
37
    
To
surround
anything
,
however
monstrous
or
ridiculous
,
with
an
air
of
mystery
,
is
to
invest
it
with
a
secret
charm
,
and
power
of
attraction
which
to
the
crowd
is
irresistible
.
 
<EOS>
False
priests
,
false
prophets
,
false
doctors
,
false
patriots
,
false
prodigies
of
every
kind
,
veiling
their
proceedings
in
mystery
,
have
always
addressed
themselves
at
an
immense
advantage
to
the
popular
credulity
,
and
have
been
,
perhaps
,
more
indebted
to
that
resource
in
gaining
and
keeping
for
a
time
the
upper
hand
of
Truth
and
Common
Sense
,
than
to
any
half
-
dozen
items
in
the
whole
catalogue
of
imposture
.
 
<EOS>
Curiosity
is
,
and
has
been
from
the
creation
of
the
world
,
a
master
-
passion
.
 
<EOS>
To
awaken
it
,
to
gratify
it
by
slight
degrees
,
and
yet
leave
something
always
in
suspense
,
is
to
establish
the
surest
hold
that
can
be
had
,
in
wrong
,
on
the
unthinking
portion
of
mankind
.
  
<EOS>
If
a
man
had
stood
on
London
Bridge
,
calling
till
he
was
hoarse
,
upon
the
passers
-
by
,
to
join
with
Lord
George
Gordon
,
although
for
an
object
which
no
man
understood
,
and
which
in
that
very
incident
had
a
charm
of
its
own
,
---
the
probability
is
,
that
he
might
have
influenced
a
score
of
people
in
a
month
.
 
<EOS>
If
all
zealous
Protestants
had
been
publicly
urged
to
join
an
association
for
the
avowed
purpose
of
singing
a
hymn
or
two
occasionally
,
and
hearing
some
indifferent
speeches
made
,
and
ultimately
of
petitioning
Parliament
not
to
pass
an
act
for
abolishing
the
penal
laws
against
Roman
Catholic
priests
,
the
penalty
of
perpetual
imprisonment
denounced
against
those
who
educated
children
in
that
persuasion
,
and
the
disqualification
of
all
members
of
the
Romish
church
to
inherit
real
property
in
the
United
Kingdom
by
right
of
purchase
or
descent
,
---
matters
so
far
removed
from
the
business
and
bosoms
of
the
mass
,
might
perhaps
have
called
together
a
hundred
people
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
vague
rumours
got
abroad
,
that
in
this
Protestant
association
a
secret
power
was
mustering
against
the
government
for
undefined
and
mighty
purposes
;
when
the
air
was
filled
with
whispers
of
a
confederacy
among
the
Popish
powers
to
degrade
and
enslave
England
,
establish
an
inquisition
in
London
,
and
turn
the
pens
of
Smithfield
market
into
stakes
and
cauldrons
;
when
terrors
and
alarms
which
no
man
understood
were
perpetually
broached
,
both
in
and
out
of
Parliament
,
by
one
enthusiast
who
did
not
understand
himself
,
and
bygone
bugbears
which
had
lain
quietly
in
their
graves
for
centuries
,
were
raised
again
to
haunt
the
ignorant
and
credulous
;
when
all
this
was
done
,
as
it
were
,
in
the
dark
,
and
secret
invitations
to
join
the
Great
Protestant
Association
in
defence
of
religion
,
life
,
and
liberty
,
were
dropped
in
the
public
ways
,
thrust
under
the
house
-
doors
,
tossed
in
at
windows
,
and
pressed
into
the
hands
of
those
who
trod
the
streets
by
night
;
when
they
glared
from
every
wall
,
and
shone
on
every
post
and
pillar
,
so
that
stocks
and
stones
appeared
infected
with
the
common
fear
,
urging
all
men
to
join
together
blindfold
in
resistance
of
<EOS>
they
knew
not
what
,
they
knew
not
why
;
---
then
the
mania
spread
indeed
,
and
the
body
,
still
increasing
every
day
,
grew
forty
thousand
strong
.
  
<EOS>
So
said
,
at
least
,
in
this
month
of
March
,
1780
,
Lord
George
Gordon
,
the
Association
's
president
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
it
was
the
fact
or
otherwise
,
few
men
knew
or
cared
to
ascertain
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
never
made
any
public
demonstration
;
had
scarcely
ever
been
heard
of
,
save
through
him
;
had
never
been
seen
;
and
was
supposed
by
many
to
be
the
mere
creature
of
his
disordered
brain
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
accustomed
to
talk
largely
about
numbers
of
men
<EOS>
---
stimulated
,
as
it
was
inferred
,
by
certain
successful
disturbances
,
arising
out
of
the
same
subject
,
which
had
occurred
in
Scotland
in
the
previous
year
;
was
looked
upon
as
a
cracked
-
brained
member
of
the
lower
house
,
who
attacked
all
parties
and
sided
with
none
,
and
was
very
little
regarded
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
known
that
there
was
discontent
abroad
<EOS>
---
there
always
is
;
he
had
been
accustomed
to
address
the
people
by
placard
,
speech
,
and
pamphlet
,
upon
other
questions
;
nothing
had
come
,
in
England
,
of
his
past
exertions
,
and
nothing
was
apprehended
from
his
present
.
 
<EOS>
Just
as
he
has
come
upon
the
reader
,
he
had
come
,
from
time
to
time
,
upon
the
public
,
and
been
forgotten
in
a
day
;
as
suddenly
as
he
appears
in
these
pages
,
after
a
blank
of
five
long
years
,
did
he
and
his
proceedings
begin
to
force
themselves
,
about
this
period
,
upon
the
notice
of
thousands
of
people
,
who
had
mingled
in
active
life
during
the
whole
interval
,
and
who
,
without
being
deaf
or
blind
to
passing
events
,
had
scarcely
ever
thought
of
him
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
"
said
Gashford
in
his
ear
,
as
he
drew
the
curtains
of
his
bed
betimes
;
"
my
lord
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
---
who
's
that
?
 
<EOS>
What
is
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
clock
has
struck
nine
,
"
returned
the
secretary
,
with
meekly
folded
hands
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
slept
well
?
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
have
slept
well
?
<EOS>
If
my
prayers
are
heard
,
you
are
refreshed
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
say
the
truth
,
I
have
slept
so
soundly
,
"
said
Lord
George
,
rubbing
his
eyes
and
looking
round
the
room
,
"
that
I
do
n't
remember
quite
---
what
place
is
this
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
lord
!
"
cried
Gashford
,
with
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
returned
his
superior
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
not
a
Jew
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
Jew
!
"
exclaimed
the
pious
secretary
,
recoiling
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
dreamed
that
we
were
Jews
,
Gashford
.
 
<EOS>
You
and
I
---
both
of
us
---
 
Jews
with
long
beards
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Heaven
forbid
,
my
lord
!
 
<EOS>
We
might
as
well
be
Papists
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
we
might
,
"
returned
the
other
,
very
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Eh
?
 
<EOS>
You
really
think
so
,
Gashford
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Surely
I
do
,
"
the
secretary
cried
,
with
looks
of
great
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
"
<EOS>
he
muttered
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
that
seems
reasonable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
my
lord
---
"
the
secretary
began
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hope
!
"
<EOS>
he
echoed
,
interrupting
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
say
,
you
hope
?
<EOS>
There
's
no
harm
in
thinking
of
such
things
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
in
dreams
,
"
returned
the
Secretary
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
dreams
!
 
<EOS>
No
,
nor
waking
either
.
<EOS>
"
   
---
<EOS>
"
"
Called
,
and
chosen
,
and
faithful
,
"
"
said
Gashford
,
taking
up
Lord
George
's
watch
which
lay
upon
a
chair
,
and
seeming
to
read
the
inscription
on
the
seal
,
abstractedly
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
slightest
action
possible
,
not
obtruded
on
his
notice
,
and
apparently
the
result
of
a
moment
's
absence
of
mind
,
not
worth
remark
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
the
words
were
uttered
,
Lord
George
,
who
had
been
going
on
impetuously
,
stopped
short
,
reddened
,
and
was
silent
.
<EOS>
Apparently
quite
unconscious
of
this
change
in
his
demeanour
,
the
wily
Secretary
stepped
a
little
apart
,
under
pretence
of
pulling
up
the
window
-
blind
,
and
returning
when
the
other
had
had
time
to
recover
,
said
:
  
"
The
holy
cause
goes
bravely
on
,
my
lord
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
not
idle
,
even
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
dropped
two
of
the
handbills
before
I
went
to
bed
,
and
both
are
gone
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
in
the
house
has
mentioned
the
circumstance
of
finding
them
,
though
I
have
been
downstairs
full
half
-
an
-
hour
.
 
<EOS>
One
or
two
recruits
will
be
their
first
fruit
,
I
predict
;
and
who
shall
say
how
many
more
,
with
Heaven
's
blessing
on
your
inspired
exertions
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
famous
device
in
the
beginning
,
"
replied
Lord
George
;
"
an
excellent
device
,
and
did
good
service
in
Scotland
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
quite
worthy
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
remind
me
not
to
be
a
sluggard
,
Gashford
,
when
the
vineyard
is
menaced
with
destruction
,
and
may
be
trodden
down
by
Papist
feet
.
 
<EOS>
Let
the
horses
be
saddled
in
half
-
an
-
hour
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
be
up
and
doing
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
said
this
with
a
heightened
colour
,
and
in
a
tone
of
such
enthusiasm
,
that
the
secretary
deemed
all
further
prompting
needless
,
and
withdrew
.
   
<EOS>
---
"
Dreamed
he
was
a
Jew
,
"
he
said
thoughtfully
,
as
he
closed
the
bedroom
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
may
come
to
that
before
he
dies
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
like
enough
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
After
a
time
,
and
provided
I
lost
nothing
by
it
,
I
do
n't
see
why
that
religion
should
n't
suit
me
as
well
as
any
other
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
rich
men
among
the
Jews
;
shaving
is
very
troublesome
;
---
yes
,
it
would
suit
me
well
enough
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
present
,
though
,
we
must
be
Christian
to
the
core
.
 
<EOS>
Our
prophetic
motto
will
suit
all
creeds
in
their
turn
,
that
's
a
comfort
.
"
 
<EOS>
Reflecting
on
this
source
of
consolation
,
he
reached
the
sitting
-
room
,
and
rang
the
bell
for
breakfast
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
George
was
quickly
dressed
(
for
his
plain
toilet
was
easily
made
)
,
and
as
he
was
no
less
frugal
in
his
repasts
than
in
his
Puritan
attire
,
his
share
of
the
meal
was
soon
dispatched
.
 
<EOS>
The
secretary
,
however
,
more
devoted
to
the
good
things
of
this
world
,
or
more
intent
on
sustaining
his
strength
and
spirits
for
the
sake
of
the
Protestant
cause
,
ate
and
drank
to
the
last
minute
,
and
required
indeed
some
three
or
four
reminders
from
John
Grueby
,
before
he
could
resolve
to
tear
himself
away
from
Mr
Willet
's
plentiful
providing
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
he
came
downstairs
,
wiping
his
greasy
mouth
,
and
having
paid
John
Willet
's
bill
,
climbed
into
his
saddle
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
George
,
who
had
been
walking
up
and
down
before
the
house
talking
to
himself
with
earnest
gestures
,
mounted
his
horse
;
and
returning
old
John
Willet
's
stately
bow
,
as
well
as
the
parting
salutation
of
a
dozen
idlers
whom
the
rumour
of
a
live
lord
being
about
to
leave
the
Maypole
had
gathered
round
the
porch
,
they
rode
away
,
with
stout
John
Grueby
in
the
rear
.
  
<EOS>
If
Lord
George
Gordon
had
appeared
in
the
eyes
of
Mr
Willet
,
overnight
,
a
nobleman
of
somewhat
quaint
and
odd
exterior
,
the
impression
was
confirmed
this
morning
,
and
increased
a
hundredfold
.
<EOS>
Sitting
bolt
upright
upon
his
bony
steed
,
with
his
long
,
straight
hair
,
dangling
about
his
face
and
fluttering
in
the
wind
;
his
limbs
all
angular
and
rigid
,
his
elbows
stuck
out
on
either
side
ungracefully
,
and
his
whole
frame
jogged
and
shaken
at
every
motion
of
his
horse
's
feet
;
a
more
grotesque
or
more
ungainly
figure
can
hardly
be
conceived
.
 
<EOS>
In
lieu
of
whip
,
he
carried
in
his
hand
a
great
gold
-
headed
cane
,
as
large
as
any
footman
carries
in
these
days
,
and
his
various
modes
of
holding
this
unwieldy
weapon
---
now
upright
before
his
face
like
the
sabre
of
a
horse
-
soldier
,
now
over
his
shoulder
like
a
musket
,
now
between
his
finger
and
thumb
,
but
always
in
some
uncouth
and
awkward
fashion
---
contributed
in
no
small
degree
to
the
absurdity
of
his
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
Stiff
,
lank
,
and
solemn
,
dressed
in
an
unusual
manner
,
and
ostentatiously
exhibiting
---
whether
by
design
or
accident
---
all
his
peculiarities
of
carriage
,
gesture
,
and
conduct
,
all
the
qualities
,
natural
and
artificial
,
in
which
he
differed
from
other
men
<EOS>
;
he
might
have
moved
the
sternest
looker
-
on
to
laughter
,
and
fully
provoked
the
smiles
and
whispered
jests
which
greeted
his
departure
from
the
Maypole
inn
.
  
<EOS>
Quite
unconscious
,
however
,
of
the
effect
he
produced
,
he
trotted
on
beside
his
secretary
,
talking
to
himself
nearly
all
the
way
,
until
they
came
within
a
mile
or
two
of
London
,
when
now
and
then
some
passenger
went
by
who
knew
him
by
sight
,
and
pointed
him
out
to
some
one
else
,
and
perhaps
stood
looking
after
him
,
or
cried
in
jest
or
earnest
as
it
might
be
,
"
Hurrah
Geordie
!
 
<EOS>
No
Popery
!
"
 
<EOS>
At
which
he
would
gravely
pull
off
his
hat
,
and
bow
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
reached
the
town
and
rode
along
the
streets
,
these
notices
became
more
frequent
;
some
laughed
,
some
hissed
,
some
turned
their
heads
and
smiled
,
some
wondered
who
he
was
,
some
ran
along
the
pavement
by
his
side
and
cheered
.
 
<EOS>
When
this
happened
in
a
crush
of
carts
and
chairs
and
coaches
,
he
would
make
a
dead
stop
,
and
pulling
off
his
hat
,
cry
,
"
Gentlemen
,
No
Popery
!
"
to
which
the
gentlemen
would
respond
with
lusty
voices
,
and
with
three
times
three
;
and
then
,
on
he
would
go
again
with
a
score
or
so
of
the
raggedest
,
following
at
his
horse
's
heels
,
and
shouting
till
their
throats
were
parched
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
ladies
too
---
there
were
a
great
many
old
ladies
in
the
streets
,
and
these
all
knew
him
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
them
---
not
those
of
the
highest
rank
,
but
such
as
sold
fruit
from
baskets
and
carried
burdens
---
clapped
their
shrivelled
hands
,
and
raised
a
weazen
,
piping
,
shrill
"
Hurrah
,
my
lord
.
"
 
<EOS>
Others
waved
their
hands
or
handkerchiefs
,
or
shook
their
fans
or
parasols
,
or
threw
up
windows
and
called
in
haste
to
those
within
,
to
come
and
see
.
 
<EOS>
All
these
marks
of
popular
esteem
<EOS>
,
he
received
with
profound
gravity
and
respect
;
bowing
very
low
,
and
so
frequently
that
his
hat
was
more
off
his
head
than
on
;
and
looking
up
at
the
houses
as
he
passed
along
,
with
the
air
of
one
who
was
making
a
public
entry
,
and
yet
was
not
puffed
up
or
proud
.
  
<EOS>
So
they
rode
(
to
the
deep
and
unspeakable
disgust
of
John
Grueby
)
<EOS>
the
whole
length
of
Whitechapel
,
Leadenhall
Street
,
and
Cheapside
,
and
into
St
Paul
's
Churchyard
.
 
<EOS>
Arriving
close
to
the
cathedral
,
he
halted
;
spoke
to
Gashford
;
and
looking
upward
at
its
lofty
dome
,
shook
his
head
,
as
though
he
said
,
"
The
Church
in
Danger
!
"
 
<EOS>
Then
to
be
sure
,
the
bystanders
stretched
their
throats
indeed
;
and
he
went
on
again
with
mighty
acclamations
from
the
mob
,
and
lower
bows
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
So
along
the
Strand
,
up
Swallow
Street
,
into
the
Oxford
Road
,
and
thence
to
his
house
in
Welbeck
Street
,
near
Cavendish
Square
,
whither
he
was
attended
by
a
few
dozen
idlers
;
of
whom
he
took
leave
on
the
steps
with
this
brief
parting
,
"
Gentlemen
,
No
Popery
.
<EOS>
Good
day
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
being
rather
a
shorter
address
than
they
expected
,
was
received
with
some
displeasure
,
and
cries
of
"
A
speech
!
<EOS>
a
speech
!
"
which
might
have
been
complied
with
,
but
that
John
Grueby
,
making
a
mad
charge
upon
them
with
all
three
horses
,
on
his
way
to
the
stables
,
caused
them
to
disperse
into
the
adjoining
fields
,
where
they
presently
fell
to
pitch
and
toss
,
chuck
-
farthing
,
odd
or
even
,
dog
-
fighting
,
and
other
Protestant
recreations
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
afternoon
Lord
George
came
forth
again
,
dressed
in
a
black
velvet
coat
,
and
trousers
and
waistcoat
of
the
Gordon
plaid
,
all
of
the
same
Quaker
cut
;
and
in
this
costume
,
which
made
him
look
a
dozen
times
more
strange
and
singular
than
before
,
went
down
on
foot
to
Westminster
.
 
<EOS>
Gashford
,
meanwhile
,
bestirred
himself
in
business
matters
;
with
which
he
was
still
engaged
when
,
shortly
after
dusk
,
John
Grueby
entered
and
announced
a
visitor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
him
come
in
,
"
said
Gashford
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
!
come
in
!
"
<EOS>
growled
John
to
somebody
without
;
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
Protestant
,
an't
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
so
,
"
replied
a
deep
,
gruff
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
've
the
looks
of
it
,
"
said
John
Grueby
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'd
have
known
you
for
one
,
anywhere
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
which
remark
he
gave
the
visitor
admission
,
retired
,
and
shut
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
The
man
who
now
confronted
Gashford
,
was
a
squat
,
thickset
personage
,
with
a
low
,
retreating
forehead
,
a
coarse
shock
head
of
hair
,
and
eyes
so
small
and
near
together
,
that
his
broken
nose
alone
seemed
to
prevent
their
meeting
and
fusing
into
one
of
the
usual
size
.
 
<EOS>
A
dingy
handkerchief
twisted
like
a
cord
about
his
neck
,
left
its
great
veins
exposed
to
view
,
and
they
were
swollen
and
starting
,
as
though
with
gulping
down
strong
passions
,
malice
,
and
ill
-
will
.
 
<EOS>
His
dress
was
of
threadbare
velveteen
---
a
faded
,
rusty
,
whitened
black
,
like
the
ashes
of
a
pipe
or
a
coal
fire
after
a
day
's
extinction
;
discoloured
with
the
soils
of
many
a
stale
debauch
,
and
reeking
yet
with
pot

house
odours
.
 
<EOS>
In
lieu
of
buckles
at
his
knees
,
he
wore
unequal
loops
of
packthread
;
and
in
his
grimy
hands
he
held
a
knotted
stick
,
the
knob
of
which
was
carved
into
a
rough
likeness
of
his
own
vile
face
.
 
<EOS>
Such
was
the
visitor
who
doffed
his
three
-
cornered
hat
in
Gashford
's
presence
,
and
waited
,
leering
,
for
his
notice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah

cried
the
secretary
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sit
down

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
my
lord
down
yonder

cried
the
man
,
with
a
jerk
of
his
thumb
towards
the
quarter
that
he
spoke
of
,
"
and
he
says
to
me
,
says
my
lord
,
"
If
you

nothing

Of

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
sometimes
in
the
day

time

eh

"
said
the
secretary
---
"
when
you
go
out
in
state
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ha

"
roared
the
fellow
,
smiting
his
leg
;
"
for
a
gentleman
as

<EOS>
Ah

when
I
go
out
in

<EOS>
"
  
"
And
have
your

said
the
secretary
;
"
and
your

eh

<EOS>
and
all
the
rest
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
be
the
death
of

cried
Dennis
,
with
another
roar
,
"
you
will
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
's
in
the
wind
now
<EOS>
,
Muster
Gashford
,
"
he
asked
hoarsely
,
"
Eh
?
 
<EOS>
Are
we
to
be
under
orders
to
pull
down
one
of
them
Popish
chapels

or
what
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Hush
!
"
said
the
secretary
,
suffering
the
faintest
smile
to
play
upon
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
 
<EOS>
God
bless
me
,
Dennis

<EOS>
We

for
strictly
peaceable
and
lawful
purposes

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know

you

returned
the
man
,
thrusting
his
tongue
into
his
cheek
;
"
I
entered
a
"
purpose
,
did
n't
I
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
,
"
said
Gashford
,
smiling
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
he
said
so
,
Dennis
roared
again
,
and
smote
his
leg
still
harder
,
and
falling
into
fits
of
laughter
,
wiped
his
eyes
with
the
corner
of
his
neckerchief
,
and
cried
,
"
Muster
Gashford

all
England

"
  
<EOS>
"
Lord
George
and
I
were
talking
of
you
last
night

said
Gashford
,
after
a
pause
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
says
you
are
a
very
earnest
fellow

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
am

returned
the
hangman
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
that
you
truly
hate
the
Papists
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
do
,

and
he
confirmed
it
with
a
good
round
oath
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lookye
here
,
Muster
Gashford
,
"
said
the
fellow
,
laying
his
hat
and
stick
upon
the
floor
,
and
slowly
beating
the
palm
of
one
hand
with
the
fingers
of
the
other
;
"
Ob

leaning

yawning

<EOS>
I

half

and
sometimes
he
throws
me
in
one
over
that
I
do
n't
expect
,
as
he
did
three
year
ago
,
when
I
got
Mary
Jones
,
a
young
woman
of
nineteen
who
come
up
to
Tyburn
with
a
infant
at
her
breast
,
and
was
worked
off
for
taking
a
piece
of
cloth
off
the
counter
of
a
shop
in
Ludgate
Hill
,
and
putting
it
down
again
when
the
shopman
see
her
;
and
who
had
never
done
any
harm
before
,
and
only
tried
to
do
that
,
in
consequence
of
her
husband
having
been
pressed
three
weeks
previous
,
and
she
being
left
to
beg
,
with
two
young

was

upon

said
the
secretary

<EOS>
"
And
in
times

pursued
the
hangman
,
"
if
our

think

find

I

the

"
Well

said
the

repeated
the
secretary
with
some
indignation
;

of
course

<EOS>
"
Well

said
the
ruffian

I

twice

the

for

thought
how
many
new
hanging

made

,
I
considered
that
I
was
prayed
for

<EOS>
Now
mind

said
the
fellow
,
taking
up
his
stick
and
shaking
it
with
a
ferocious
air
,
"
I

Protestant

<EOS>

I
must

no
Papists

off
in

<EOS>
In
support

having
plenty

here
he
beat
his
club
upon
the
ground

burn

fight

kill

<EOS>
do
anything
you
bid
me
,
so
that
it

bold

devilish

the
end

it
was
,
that
I
got
hung
myself

<EOS>

There
,
Muster
Gashford
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
appropriately
followed
up
this
frequent
prostitution
of
a
noble
word
to
the
vilest
purposes
,
by
pouring
out
in
a
kind
of
ecstasy
at
least
a
score
of
most
tremendous
oaths
;
then
wiped
his
heated
face
upon
his
neckerchief
,
and
cried
,
"
No
Popery

<EOS>
I
'm
a
religious

<EOS>
Gashford
had
leant
back
in
his
chair
,
regarding
him
with
eyes
<EOS>
so
sunken
,
and
so
shadowed
by
his
heavy
brows
,
that
for
aught
the
hangman
saw
of
them
,
he
might
have
been
stone
blind
.
 
<EOS>
He
remained
smiling
in
silence
for
a
short
time
longer
,
and
then
said
,
slowly
and
distinctly
:
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
indeed
an
earnest
fellow

Dennis
---
a
most
valuable
fellow

the
staunchest
man
I
know
of
in
our
ranks

<EOS>
But
you
must
calm
yourself
;
you
must
be
peaceful
,
lawful
,
mild
as
any
lamb

<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
will
be

Ay

shall
see

<EOS>
You
wo
n't
have
to
complain
of
me

"
returned
the
other
,
shaking
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
I
shall
not
,
"
said
the
secretary
in
the
same
mild
tone
,
and
with
the
same
emphasis
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
have
,
we
think
,
about
next
month
,
or
May
,
when
this
Papist
relief
bill
comes
before
the
house
,
to
convene
our
whole
body
for
the
first
time

<EOS>
My
lord
has
thoughts
of
our
walking
in
procession
through
the
streets
---
just
as
an
innocent
display
of
strength
---
and
accompanying
our
petition
down
to
the
door
of
the
House
of
Commons
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
sooner
the
better

"
said
Dennis
,
with
another
oath
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
have
to
draw
up
in
divisions
,
our
numbers
being
so
large
;
and
,
I
believe
I
may
venture
to
say
,
"
resumed
Gashford
,
affecting
not
to
hear
the
interruption
,
"
though
I
have
no
direct
instructions
to
that
effect
---
that
Lord
George
has
thought
of
you
as
an
excellent
leader
for
one
of
these
parties
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
you
would
be
an
admirable
one

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Try
me
,
"
said
the
fellow
,
with
an
ugly
wink
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
be
cool
,
I
know
,
"
pursued
the
secretary
,
still
smiling
,
and
still
managing
his
eyes
so
that
he
could
watch
him
closely
,
and
really
not
be
seen
in
turn
,
"
obedient
to
orders
,
and
perfectly
temperate
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
lead
your
party
into
no
danger
,
I
am
certain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'd
lead
them
,
Muster
Gashford
,
"
---
the
hangman
was
beginning
in
a
reckless
way
,
when
Gashford
started
forward
,
laid
his
finger
on
his
lips
,
and
feigned
to
write
,
just
as
the
door
was
opened
by
John
Grueby
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
John
,
looking
in
;
"
here
's
another
Protestant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Some
other
room
,
John

cried
Gashford
in
his
blandest
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
engaged
just
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
John
had
brought
this
new
visitor
to
the
door
,
and
he
walked
in
unbidden
,
as
the
words
were
uttered
;
giving
to
view
the
form
and
features
,
rough
attire
,
and
reckless
air
,
of
Hugh

Chapter

<EOS>
The
secretary
put
his
hand
before
his
eyes
to
shade
them
from
the
glare
of
the
lamp
,
and
for
some
moments
looked
at
Hugh
with
a
frowning
brow
,
as
if
he
remembered
to
have
seen
him
lately
,
but
could
not
call
to
mind
where
,
or
on
what
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
His
uncertainty
was
very
brief
,
for
before
Hugh
had
spoken
a
word
,
he
said
,
as
his
countenance
cleared
up
:
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
I
recollect
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
quite
right
,
John
,
you
need
n't
wait
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
go
,
Dennis
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Your
servant
,
master
,
"
said
Hugh
,
as
Grueby
disappeared
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yours
,
friend
,
"
returned
the
secretary
in
his
smoothest
manner
.
<EOS>
"
What
brings
YOU
here
?
 
<EOS>
We
left
nothing
behind
us
,
I
hope
?
"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
gave
a
short
laugh
,
and
thrusting
his
hand
into
his
breast
,
produced
one
of
the
handbills
,
soiled
and
dirty
from
lying
out
of
doors
all
night
,
which
he
laid
upon
the
secretary
's
desk
after
flattening
it
upon
his
knee
,
and
smoothing
out
the
wrinkles
with
his
heavy
palm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
but
that
,
master
.
 
<EOS>
It
fell
into
good
hands
,
you
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
this
!
"
<EOS>
said
Gashford
,
turning
it
over
with
an
air
of
perfectly
natural
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
did
you
get
it
from
,
my
good
fellow
;
what
does
it
mean
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
understand
this
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
A
little
disconcerted
by
this
reception
,
Hugh
looked
from
the
secretary
to
Dennis
,
who
had
risen
and
was
standing
at
the
table
too
,
observing
the
stranger
by
stealth
,
and
seeming
to
derive
the
utmost
satisfaction
from
his
manners
and
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
Considering
himself
silently
appealed
to
by
this
action
,
Mr
Dennis
shook
his
head
thrice
,
as
if
to
say
of
Gashford
,
"
No
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
n't
know
anything
at
all
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
he
do
n't
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
take
my
oath
<EOS>
he
do
n't
;
"
and
hiding
his
profile
from
Hugh
with
one
long
end
of
his
frowzy
neckerchief
,
nodded
and
chuckled
behind
this
screen
in
extreme
approval
of
the
secretary
's
proceedings
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
tells
the
man
that
finds
it
,
to
come
here
,
do
n't
it
?
"
asked
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
no
scholar
,
myself
,
but
I
showed
it
to
a
friend
,
and
he
said
it
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
certainly
does
,
"
said
Gashford
,
opening
his
eyes
to
their
utmost
width
;
"
really
this
is
the
most
remarkable
circumstance
I
have
ever
known
.
 
<EOS>
How
did
you
come
by
this
piece
of
paper
,
my
good
friend
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Muster
Gashford
,
"
wheezed
the
hangman
under
his
breath
,
"
agin
'
all
Newgate
!
"
  
<EOS>
Whether
Hugh
heard
him
,
or
saw
by
his
manner
that
he
was
being
played
upon
,
or
perceived
the
secretary
's
drift
of
himself
,
he
came
in
his
blunt
way
to
the
point
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
!
"
he
said
,
stretching
out
his
hand
and
taking
it
back
;
"
never
mind
the
bill
,
or
what
it
says
,
or
what
it
do
n't
say
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
know
anything
about
it
,
master
,
---
no
more
do
I
,
---
no
more
does
he
,
"
glancing
at
Dennis
.
 
<EOS>
"
None
of
us
know
what
it
means
,
or
where
it
comes
from
:
there
's
an
end
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
Now
I
want
to
make
one
against
the
Catholics
<EOS>
,
I
'm
a
No
-
Popery
man
,
and
ready
to
be
sworn
in
.
<EOS>
That
's
what
I
've
come
here
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Put
him
down
on
the
roll
,
Muster
Gashford
,
"
said
Dennis
approvingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
way
to
go
to
work
---
right
to
the
end
at
once
,
and
no
palaver
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
use
of
shooting
wide
of
the
mark
,
eh
,
old
boy
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Hugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
sentiments
all
over
!
"
rejoined
the
hangman
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
sort
of
chap
for
my
division
,
Muster
Gashford
.
 
<EOS>
Down
with
him
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Put
him
on
the
roll
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
stand
godfather
to
him
,
if
he
was
to
be
christened
in
a
bonfire
,
made
of
the
ruins
of
the
Bank
of
England
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
these
and
other
expressions
of
confidence
of
the
like
flattering
kind
,
Mr
Dennis
gave
him
a
hearty
slap
on
the
back
,
which
Hugh
was
not
slow
to
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
Popery
,
brother
!
"
cried
the
hangman
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
Property
,
brother
!
"
responded
Hugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
Popery
,
Popery
,
"
said
the
secretary
with
his
usual
mildness
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
the
same
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Dennis
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
right
.
 
<EOS>
Down
with
him
,
Muster
Gashford
.
 
<EOS>
Down
with
everybody
,
down
with
everything
!
<EOS>
Hurrah
for
the
Protestant
religion
!
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
time
of
day
,
Muster
Gashford
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
secretary
regarded
them
both
with
a
very
favourable
expression
of
countenance
,
while
they
gave
loose
to
these
and
other
demonstrations
of
their
patriotic
purpose
;
and
was
about
to
make
some
remark
aloud
,
when
Dennis
,
stepping
up
to
him
,
and
shading
his
mouth
with
his
hand
,
said
,
in
a
hoarse
whisper
,
as
he
nudged
him
with
his
elbow
:
  
"
Do
n't
split
upon
a
constitutional
officer
's
profession
,
Muster
Gashford
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
popular
prejudices
,
you
know
,
and
he
might
n't
like
it
.
 
<EOS>
Wait
till
he
comes
to
be
more
intimate
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
a
fine
-
built
chap
,
an't
he
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
powerful
fellow
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
ever
,
Muster
Gashford
,
"
whispered
Dennis
,
with
a
horrible
kind
of
admiration
,
such
as
that
with
which
a
cannibal
might
regard
his
intimate
friend
,
when
hungry
<EOS>
,
---
"
did
you
ever
---
and
here
he
drew
still
closer
to
his
ear
,
and
fenced
his
mouth
with
both
his
open
bands
---
"
see
such
a
throat
as
his
?
 
<EOS>
Do
but
cast
your
eye
upon
it
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
neck
for
stretching
,
Muster
Gashford
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
secretary
assented
to
this
proposition
with
the
best
grace
he
could
assume
---
it
is
difficult
to
feign
a
true
professional
relish
:
which
is
eccentric
sometimes
---
and
after
asking
the
candidate
a
few
unimportant
questions
,
proceeded
to
enrol
him
a
member
of
the
Great
Protestant
Association
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
If
anything
could
have
exceeded
Mr
Dennis
's
joy
on
the
happy
conclusion
of
this
ceremony
,
it
would
have
been
the
rapture
with
which
he
received
the
announcement
that
the
new
member
could
neither
read
nor
write
:
those
two
arts
being
(
as
Mr
Dennis
swore
)
the
greatest
possible
curse
a
civilised
community
could
know
,
and
militating
more
against
the
professional
emoluments
and
usefulness
of
the
great
constitutional
office
he
had
the
honour
to
hold
,
than
any
adverse
circumstances
that
could
present
themselves
to
his
imagination
.
  
<EOS>
The
enrolment
being
completed
,
and
Hugh
having
been
informed
by
Gashford
,
in
his
peculiar
manner
,
of
the
peaceful
and
strictly
lawful
objects
contemplated
by
the
body
to
which
he
now
belonged
---
 
during
which
recital
Mr
Dennis
nudged
him
very
much
with
his
elbow
,
and
made
divers
remarkable
faces
---
the
secretary
gave
them
both
to
understand
that
he
desired
to
be
alone
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
they
took
their
leaves
without
delay
,
and
came
out
of
the
house
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
walking
,
brother
?
"
said
Dennis
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
"
returned
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
you
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
social
,
"
said
his
new
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
Which
way
shall
we
take
?
<EOS>
Shall
we
go
and
have
a
look
at
doors
that
we
shall
make
a
pretty
good
clattering
at
,
before
long
---
eh
,
brother
?
"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
answering
in
the
affirmative
,
they
went
slowly
down
to
Westminster
,
where
both
houses
of
Parliament
were
then
sitting
.
<EOS>
Mingling
in
the
crowd
of
carriages
,
horses
,
servants
,
chairmen
,
link
-
boys
,
porters
,
and
idlers
of
all
kinds
,
they
lounged
about
;
while
Hugh
's
new
friend
pointed
out
to
him
significantly
the
weak
parts
of
the
building
,
how
easy
it
was
to
get
into
the
lobby
,
and
so
to
the
very
door
of
the
House
of
Commons
;
and
how
plainly
,
when
they
marched
down
there
in
grand
array
,
their
roars
and
shouts
would
be
heard
by
the
members
inside
;
with
a
great
deal
more
to
the
same
purpose
,
all
of
which
Hugh
received
with
manifest
delight
.
  
<EOS>
He
told
him
,
too
,
who
some
of
the
Lords
and
Commons
were
,
by
name
,
as
they
came
in
and
out
;
whether
they
were
friendly
to
the
Papists
or
otherwise
;
and
bade
him
take
notice
of
their
liveries
and
equipages
,
that
he
might
be
sure
of
them
,
in
case
of
need
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
he
drew
him
close
to
the
windows
of
a
passing
carriage
,
that
he
might
see
its
master
's
face
by
the
light
of
the
lamps
;
and
,
both
in
respect
of
people
and
localities
,
he
showed
so
much
acquaintance
with
everything
around
,
that
it
was
plain
he
had
often
studied
there
before
;
<EOS>
as
indeed
,
when
they
grew
a
little
more
confidential
,
he
confessed
he
had
.
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
most
striking
part
of
all
this
was
,
the
number
of
people
---
never
in
groups
of
more
than
two
or
three
together
---
who
seemed
to
be
skulking
about
the
crowd
for
the
same
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
To
the
greater
part
of
these
,
a
slight
nod
or
a
look
from
Hugh
's
companion
was
sufficient
greeting
;
but
,
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
some
man
would
come
and
stand
beside
him
in
the
throng
,
and
,
without
turning
his
head
or
appearing
to
communicate
with
him
<EOS>
,
would
say
a
word
or
two
in
a
low
voice
,
which
he
would
answer
in
the
same
cautious
manner
.
 
<EOS>
Then
they
would
part
,
like
strangers
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
these
men
often
reappeared
again
unexpectedly
in
the
crowd
close
to
Hugh
,
and
,
as
they
passed
by
,
pressed
his
hand
,
or
looked
him
sternly
in
the
face
;
but
they
never
spoke
to
him
,
nor
he
to
them
;
no
,
not
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
remarkable
,
too
,
that
whenever
they
happened
to
stand
where
there
was
any
press
of
people
,
and
Hugh
chanced
to
be
looking
downward
,
he
was
sure
to
see
an
arm
stretched
out
---
under
his
own
perhaps
,
or
perhaps
across
him
---
which
thrust
some
paper
into
the
hand
or
pocket
of
a
bystander
,
and
was
so
suddenly
withdrawn
that
it
was
impossible
to
tell
from
whom
it
came
;
nor
could
he
see
in
any
face
,
on
glancing
quickly
round
,
the
least
confusion
or
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
They
often
trod
upon
a
paper
like
the
one
he
carried
in
his
breast
,
but
his
companion
whispered
him
not
to
touch
it
or
to
take
it
up
,
---
not
even
to
look
towards
it
,
---
<EOS>
so
there
they
let
them
lie
,
and
passed
on
.
  
<EOS>
When
they
had
paraded
the
street
and
all
the
avenues
of
the
building
in
this
manner
for
near
two
hours
,
they
turned
away
,
and
his
friend
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
what
he
had
seen
,
and
whether
he
was
prepared
for
a
good
hot
piece
of
work
if
it
should
come
to
that
.
 
<EOS>
The
hotter
the
better
,
"
said
Hugh
,
"
I
'm
prepared
for
anything
.
"
<EOS>
---
"
So
am
I
,
"
said
his
friend
,
"
and
so
are
many
of
us
;
and
they
shook
hands
upon
it
with
a
great
oath
,
and
with
many
terrible
imprecations
on
the
Papists
.
  
<EOS>
As
they
were
thirsty
by
this
time
,
Dennis
proposed
that
they
should
repair
together
to
The
Boot
,
where
there
was
good
company
and
strong
liquor
.
 
<EOS>
Hugh
yielding
a
ready
assent
,
they
bent
their
steps
that
way
with
no
loss
of
time
.
  
<EOS>
This
Boot
was
a
lone
house
of
public
entertainment
,
situated
in
the
fields
at
the
back
of
the
Foundling
Hospital
;
a
very
solitary
spot
at
that
period
,
and
quite
deserted
after
dark
.
 
<EOS>
The
tavern
stood
at
some
distance
from
any
high
road
,
and
was
approachable
only
by
a
dark
and
narrow
lane
;
so
that
Hugh
was
much
surprised
to
find
several
people
drinking
there
,
and
great
merriment
going
on
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
still
more
surprised
to
find
among
them
almost
every
face
that
had
caught
his
attention
in
the
crowd
;
but
his
companion
having
whispered
him
outside
the
door
,
that
it
was
not
considered
good
manners
at
The
Boot
to
appear
at
all
curious
about
the
company
,
he
kept
his
own
counsel
,
and
made
no
show
of
recognition
.
  
<EOS>
Before
putting
his
lips
to
the
liquor
which
was
brought
for
them
,
Dennis
drank
in
a
loud
voice
the
health
of
Lord
George
Gordon
,
President
of
the
Great
Protestant
Association
;
which
toast
Hugh
pledged
likewise
,
with
corresponding
enthusiasm
.
 
<EOS>
A
fiddler
who
was
present
,
and
who
appeared
to
act
as
the
appointed
minstrel
of
the
company
,
forthwith
struck
up
a
Scotch
reel
;
and
that
in
tones
so
invigorating
,
that
Hugh
and
his
friend
(
who
had
both
been
drinking
before
)
rose
from
their
seats
as
by
previous
concert
,
and
,
to
the
great
admiration
of
the
assembled
guests
,
performed
an
extemporaneous
No
-
Popery
Dance
.

<EOS>
The
applause
which
the
performance
of
Hugh
and
his
new
friend
elicited
from
the
company
at
The
Boot
,
had
not
yet
subsided
,
and
the
two
dancers
were
still
panting
from
their
exertions
,
which
had
been
of
a
rather
extreme
and
violent
character
,
when
the
party
was
reinforced
by
the
arrival
of
some
more
guests
,
who
,
being
a
detachment
of
United
Bulldogs
,
were
received
with
very
flattering
marks
of
distinction
and
respect
.
  
<EOS>
The
leader
of
this
small
party
---
for
,
including
himself
,
they
were
but
three
in
number
---
was
our
old
acquaintance
,
Mr
Tappertit
,
who
seemed
,
physically
speaking
,
to
have
grown
smaller
with
years
(
particularly
as
to
his
legs
,
which
were
stupendously
little
)
,
but
who
,
in
a
moral
point
of
view
,
in
personal
dignity
and
self
-
esteem
,
had
swelled
into
a
giant
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
it
by
any
means
difficult
for
the
most
unobservant
person
to
detect
this
state
of
feeling
in
the
quondam
'
prentice
,
for
it
not
only
proclaimed
itself
impressively
and
beyond
mistake
in
his
majestic
walk
and
kindling
eye
,
but
found
a
striking
means
of
revelation
in
his
turned
-
up
nose
,
which
scouted
all
things
of
earth
with
deep
disdain
,
and
sought
communion
with
its
kindred
skies
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Tappertit
,
as
chief
or
captain
of
the
Bulldogs
,
was
attended
by
his
two
lieutenants
;
one
,
the
tall
comrade
of
his
younger
life
;
the
other
,
a
'
Prentice
Knight
in
days
of
yore
---
Mark
Gilbert
,
bound
in
the
olden
time
to
Thomas
Curzon
of
the
Golden
Fleece
.
 
<EOS>
These
gentlemen
,
like
himself
,
were
now
emancipated
from
their
'
prentice
thraldom
,
and
served
as
journeymen
;
but
they
were
,
in
humble
emulation
of
his
great
example
,
bold
and
daring
spirits
,
and
aspired
to
a
distinguished
state
in
great
political
events
.
 
<EOS>
Hence
their
connection
with
the
Protestant
Association
of
England
,
sanctioned
by
the
name
of
Lord
George
Gordon
;
and
hence
their
present
visit
to
The
Boot
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
!
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
,
taking
off
his
hat
as
a
great
general
might
in
addressing
his
troops
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
met
.
 
<EOS>
My
lord
does
me
and
you
the
honour
to
send
his
compliments
per
self
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
've
seen
my
lord
too
,
have
you
?
"
said
Dennis
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
him
this
afternoon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
duty
called
me
to
the
Lobby
when
our
shop
shut
up
;
and
I
saw
him
there
,
sir
,
"
Mr
Tappertit
replied
,
as
he
and
his
lieutenants
took
their
seats
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
do
YOU
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lively
,
master
,
lively
,
"
said
the
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
's
a
new
brother
,
regularly
put
down
in
black
and
white
by
Muster
Gashford
;
a
credit
to
the
cause
;
one
of
the
stick
-
at
-
nothing
sort
;
one
arter
my
own
heart
.
 
<EOS>
D'ye
see
him
?
 
<EOS>
Has
he
got
the
looks
of
a
man
that
'll
do
,
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
he
cried
,
as
he
slapped
Hugh
on
the
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
Looks
or
no
looks
,
"
said
Hugh
,
with
a
drunken
flourish
of
his
arm
,
"
I
'm
the
man
you
want
.
 
<EOS>
I
hate
the
Papists
,
every
one
of
'em
.
 
<EOS>
They
hate
me
<EOS>
and
I
hate
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
do
me
all
the
harm
they
can
,
and
I
'll
do
them
all
the
harm
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
Hurrah
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
there
ever
,
"
said
Dennis
,
looking
round
the
room
,
when
the
echo
of
his
boisterous
voice
bad
died
away
;
"
was
there
ever
such
a
game
boy
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
mean
to
say
,
brothers
,
that
if
Muster
Gashford
had
gone
a
hundred
mile
and
got
together
fifty
men
of
the
common
run
,
they
would
n't
have
been
worth
this
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
greater
part
of
the
company
implicitly
subscribed
to
this
opinion
,
and
testified
their
faith
in
Hugh
by
nods
and
looks
of
great
significance
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tappertit
sat
and
contemplated
him
for
a
long
time
in
silence
,
as
if
he
suspended
his
judgment
;
then
drew
a
little
nearer
to
him
,
and
eyed
him
over
more
carefully
;
then
went
close
up
to
him
,
and
took
him
apart
into
a
dark
corner
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
he
began
,
with
a
thoughtful
brow
,
"
have
n't
I
seen
you
before
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
like
you
may
,
"
said
Hugh
,
in
his
careless
way
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
;
should
n't
wonder
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
<EOS>
but
it
's
very
easily
settled
,
"
returned
Sim
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
at
me
.
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
see
ME
before
?
 
<EOS>
You
would
n't
be
likely
to
forget
it
,
you
know
,
if
you
ever
did
.
 
<EOS>
Look
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
afraid
;
I
wo
n't
do
you
any
harm
.
 
<EOS>
Take
a
good
look
---
steady
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
encouraging
way
in
which
Mr
Tappertit
made
this
request
,
and
coupled
it
with
an
assurance
that
he
need
n't
be
frightened
,
amused
Hugh
mightily
---
so
much
indeed
,
that
be
saw
nothing
at
all
of
the
small
man
before
him
,
through
closing
his
eyes
in
a
fit
of
hearty
laughter
,
which
shook
his
great
broad
sides
until
they
ached
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
!
"
<EOS>
said
Mr
Tappertit
,
growing
a
little
impatient
under
this
disrespectful
treatment
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
me
,
feller
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
I
,
"
cried
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
ha
ha
!
 
<EOS>
Not
I
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
should
like
to
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
yet
I
'd
have
wagered
a
seven
-
shilling
piece
,
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
,
folding
his
arms
,
and
confronting
him
with
his
legs
wide
apart
and
firmly
planted
on
the
ground
,
"
that
you
once
were
hostler
at
the
Maypole
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
opened
his
eyes
on
hearing
this
,
and
looked
at
him
in
great
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
---
And
so
you
were
,
too
,
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
,
pushing
him
away
with
a
condescending
playfulness
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
did
MY
eyes
ever
deceive
---
 
unless
it
was
a
young
woman
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
know
me
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
it
an't
---
"
Hugh
faltered
.
  
<EOS>
"
An't
it
?
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
sure
of
that
?
 
<EOS>
You
remember
G
Varden
,
do
n't
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Certainly
Hugh
did
,
and
he
remembered
D
Varden
too
;
but
that
he
did
n't
tell
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
remember
coming
down
there
,
before
I
was
out
of
my
time
,
to
ask
after
a
vagabond
that
had
bolted
off
,
and
left
his
disconsolate
father
a
prey
to
the
bitterest
emotions
,
and
all
the
rest
of
it
---
 
do
n't
you
?
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
do
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
saw
you
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Saw
me
there
!
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
should
think
you
did
see
me
there
.
 
<EOS>
The
place
would
be
troubled
to
go
on
without
me
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
remember
my
thinking
you
liked
the
vagabond
,
and
on
that
account
going
to
quarrel
with
you
;
and
then
finding
you
detested
him
worse
than
poison
,
going
to
drink
with
you
?
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
remember
that
?
"
  
"
To
be
sure
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Hugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
and
are
you
in
the
same
mind
now
?
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
!
"
<EOS>
roared
Hugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
speak
like
a
man
,
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
,
"
and
I
'll
shake
hands
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
these
conciliatory
expressions
he
suited
the
action
to
the
word
;
and
Hugh
meeting
his
advances
readily
,
they
performed
the
ceremony
with
a
show
of
great
heartiness
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
find
,
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
,
looking
round
on
the
assembled
guests
,
"
<EOS>
that
brother
What's
-
his
-
name
<EOS>
and
I
are
old
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
---
You
never
heard
anything
more
of
that
rascal
,
I
suppose
,
eh
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
syllable
,
"
replied
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
want
to
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
I
ever
shall
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
dead
long
ago
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
to
be
hoped
,
for
the
sake
of
mankind
in
general
and
the
happiness
of
society
,
that
he
is
,
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
,
rubbing
his
palm
upon
his
legs
,
and
looking
at
it
between
whiles
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
your
other
hand
at
all
cleaner
?
 
<EOS>
Much
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
'll
owe
you
another
shake
.
 
<EOS>
We
'll
suppose
it
done
,
if
you
've
no
objection
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
laughed
again
,
and
with
such
thorough
abandonment
to
his
mad
humour
,
that
his
limbs
seemed
dislocated
,
and
his
whole
frame
in
danger
of
tumbling
to
pieces
;
but
Mr
Tappertit
,
so
far
from
receiving
this
extreme
merriment
with
any
irritation
,
was
pleased
to
regard
it
with
the
utmost
favour
,
and
even
to
join
in
it
,
so
far
as
one
of
his
gravity
and
station
could
,
with
any
regard
to
that
decency
and
decorum
which
men
in
high
places
are
expected
to
maintain
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Tappertit
did
not
stop
here
,
as
many
public
characters
might
have
done
,
but
calling
up
his
brace
of
lieutenants
,
introduced
Hugh
to
them
with
high
commendation
;
declaring
him
to
be
a
man
who
,
at
such
times
as
those
in
which
they
lived
,
could
not
be
too
much
cherished
.
 
<EOS>
Further
,
he
did
him
the
honour
to
remark
,
that
he
would
be
an
acquisition
of
which
even
the
United
Bulldogs
might
be
proud
;
and
finding
,
upon
sounding
him
,
that
he
was
quite
ready
and
willing
to
enter
the
society
(
for
he
was
not
at
all
particular
,
and
would
have
leagued
himself
that
night
with
anything
,
or
anybody
,
for
any
purpose
whatsoever
)
,
caused
the
necessary
preliminaries
to
be
gone
into
upon
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
This
tribute
to
his
great
merit
delighted
no
man
more
than
Mr
Dennis
,
as
he
himself
proclaimed
with
several
rare
and
surprising
oaths
;
and
indeed
it
gave
unmingled
satisfaction
to
the
whole
assembly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Make
anything
you
like
of
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Hugh
,
flourishing
the
can
he
had
emptied
more
than
once
.
 
<EOS>
"
Put
me
on
any
duty
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
your
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
Here
's
my
captain
---
here
's
my
leader
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
ha
ha
!
 
<EOS>
Let
him
give
me
the
word
of
command
,
and
I
'll
fight
the
whole
Parliament
House
single
-
handed
,
or
set
a
lighted
torch
to
the
King
's
Throne
itself
!
"
 
<EOS>
With
that
,
he
smote
Mr
Tappertit
on
the
back
,
with
such
violence
that
his
little
body
seemed
to
shrink
into
a
mere
nothing
;
and
roared
again
until
the
very
foundlings
near
at
hand
were
startled
in
their
beds
.
  
<EOS>
In
fact
,
a
sense
of
something
whimsical
in
their
companionship
seemed
to
have
taken
entire
possession
of
his
rude
brain
.
 
<EOS>
The
bare
fact
of
being
patronised
by
a
great
man
whom
he
could
have
crushed
with
one
hand
,
appeared
in
his
eyes
so
eccentric
and
humorous
,
that
a
kind
of
ferocious
merriment
gained
the
mastery
over
him
,
and
quite
subdued
his
brutal
nature
.
 
<EOS>
He
roared
and
roared
again
;
toasted
Mr
Tappertit
a
hundred
times
;
declared
himself
a
Bulldog
to
the
core
;
and
vowed
to
be
faithful
to
him
to
the
last
drop
of
blood
in
his
veins
.
  
<EOS>
All
these
compliments
Mr
Tappertit
received
as
matters
of
course
---
 
flattering
enough
in
their
way
,
but
entirely
attributable
to
his
vast
superiority
.
 
<EOS>
His
dignified
self
-
possession
only
delighted
Hugh
the
more
;
and
in
a
word
,
this
giant
and
dwarf
struck
up
a
friendship
which
bade
fair
to
be
of
long
continuance
,
as
the
one
held
it
to
be
his
right
to
command
,
and
the
other
considered
it
an
exquisite
pleasantry
to
obey
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
Hugh
by
any
means
a
passive
follower
,
who
scrupled
to
act
without
precise
and
definite
orders
;
for
when
Mr
Tappertit
mounted
on
an
empty
cask
which
stood
by
way
of
rostrum
in
the
room
,
and
volunteered
a
speech
upon
the
alarming
crisis
then
at
hand
,
he
placed
himself
beside
the
orator
,
and
though
he
grinned
from
ear
to
ear
at
every
word
he
said
,
threw
out
such
expressive
hints
to
scoffers
in
the
management
of
his
cudgel
,
that
those
who
were
at
first
the
most
disposed
to
interrupt
,
became
remarkably
attentive
,
and
were
the
loudest
in
their
approbation
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
all
noise
and
jest
,
however
,
at
The
Boot
,
nor
were
the
whole
party
listeners
to
the
speech
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
some
men
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
(
which
was
a
long
,
low
-
roofed
chamber
)
in
earnest
conversation
all
the
time
;
and
when
any
of
this
group
went
out
,
fresh
people
were
sure
to
come
in
soon
afterwards
and
sit
down
in
their
places
,
as
though
the
others
had
relieved
them
on
some
watch
or
duty
;
which
it
was
pretty
clear
they
did
,
for
these
changes
took
place
by
the
clock
,
at
intervals
of
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
These
persons
whispered
very
much
among
themselves
,
and
kept
aloof
,
and
often
looked
round
,
as
jealous
of
their
speech
being
overheard
;
some
two
or
three
among
them
entered
in
books
what
seemed
to
be
reports
from
the
others
;
when
they
were
not
thus
employed
)
<EOS>
one
of
them
would
turn
to
the
newspapers
which
were
strewn
upon
the
table
,
and
from
the
St
James
's
Chronicle
,
the
Herald
,
Chronicle
,
or
Public
Advertiser
,
would
read
to
the
rest
in
a
low
voice
some
passage
having
reference
to
the
topic
in
which
they
were
all
so
deeply
interested
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
great
attraction
was
a
pamphlet
called
The
Thunderer
,
which
espoused
their
own
opinions
,
and
was
supposed
at
that
time
to
emanate
directly
from
the
Association
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
always
in
request
;
and
whether
read
aloud
,
to
an
eager
knot
of
listeners
,
or
by
some
solitary
man
,
was
certain
to
be
followed
by
stormy
talking
and
excited
looks
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
all
his
merriment
,
and
admiration
of
his
captain
,
Hugh
was
made
sensible
by
these
and
other
tokens
,
of
the
presence
of
an
air
of
mystery
,
akin
to
that
which
had
so
much
impressed
him
out
of
doors
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
discard
a
sense
that
something
serious
was
going
on
,
and
that
under
the
noisy
revel
of
the
public
-
house
,
there
lurked
unseen
and
dangerous
matter
.
 
<EOS>
Little
affected
by
this
,
however
,
he
was
perfectly
satisfied
with
his
quarters
and
would
have
remained
there
till
morning
,
but
that
his
conductor
rose
soon
after
midnight
,
to
go
home
;
Mr
Tappertit
following
his
example
,
left
him
no
excuse
to
stay
.
 
<EOS>
So
they
all
three
left
the
house
together
:
roaring
a
No
-
Popery
song
until
the
fields
resounded
with
the
dismal
noise
.
  
<EOS>
Cheer
up
,
captain
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Hugh
,
when
they
had
roared
themselves
out
of
breath
.
 
<EOS>
"
Another
stave
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Tappertit
,
nothing
loath
,
began
again
;
and
so
the
three
went
staggering
on
,
arm
-
in
-
arm
,
shouting
like
madmen
,
and
defying
the
watch
with
great
valour
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
this
did
not
require
any
unusual
bravery
or
boldness
,
as
the
watchmen
of
that
time
,
being
selected
for
the
office
on
account
of
excessive
age
and
extraordinary
infirmity
,
had
a
custom
of
shutting
themselves
up
tight
in
their
boxes
on
the
first
symptoms
of
disturbance
,
and
remaining
there
until
they
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
In
these
proceedings
,
Mr
Dennis
,
who
had
a
gruff
voice
and
lungs
of
considerable
power
,
distinguished
himself
very
much
,
and
acquired
great
credit
with
his
two
companions
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
queer
fellow
you
are
!
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
so
precious
sly
and
close
.
 
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
you
ever
tell
what
trade
you
're
of
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Answer
the
captain
instantly
,
"
cried
Hugh
,
beating
his
hat
down
on
his
head
;
"
why
do
n't
you
ever
tell
what
trade
you
're
of
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
of
as
gen
-
teel
a
calling
,
brother
,
as
any
man
in
England
---
as
light
a
business
as
any
gentleman
could
desire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
you
'
prenticed
to
it
?
"
asked
Mr
Tappertit
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
Natural
genius
,
"
said
Mr
Dennis
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
'
prenticing
.
 
<EOS>
It
come
by
natur
'
.
 
<EOS>
Muster
Gashford
knows
my
calling
.
 
<EOS>
Look
at
that
hand
of
mine
---
many
and
many
a
job
that
hand
has
done
,
with
a
neatness
and
dex
-
terity
,
never
known
afore
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
look
at
that
hand
,
"
said
Mr
Dennis
,
shaking
it
in
the
air
,
"
and
remember
the
helegant
bits
of
work
it
has
turned
off
,
I
feel
quite
molloncholy
to
think
it
should
ever
grow
old
and
feeble
.
 
<EOS>
But
sich
is
life
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
heaved
a
deep
sigh
as
he
indulged
in
these
reflections
,
and
putting
his
fingers
with
an
absent
air
on
Hugh
's
throat
,
and
particularly
under
his
left
ear
,
as
if
he
were
studying
the
anatomical
development
of
that
part
of
his
frame
,
shook
his
head
in
a
despondent
manner
and
actually
shed
tears
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
kind
of
artist
,
I
suppose
---
eh
!
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
rejoined
Dennis
;
"
yes
---
I
may
call
myself
a
artist
---
a
fancy
workman
---
art
improves
natur
"
---
that
's
my
motto
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
do
you
call
this
?
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
taking
his
stick
out
of
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
my
portrait
atop
,
"
Dennis
replied
;
"
d'ye
think
it
's
like
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
---
it
's
a
little
too
handsome
,
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
did
it
?
<EOS>
You
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Dennis
,
gazing
fondly
on
his
image
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
had
the
talent
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
carved
by
a
friend
of
mine
,
as
is
now
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
day
afore
he
died
,
he
cut
that
with
his
pocket
-
knife
from
memory
!
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
die
game
,
"
says
my
friend
,
"
and
my
last
moments
shall
be
dewoted
to
making
Dennis
's
picter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
That
's
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
was
a
queer
fancy
,
was
n't
it
?
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
WAS
a
queer
fancy
,
"
rejoined
the
other
,
breathing
on
his
fictitious
nose
,
and
polishing
it
with
the
cuff
of
his
coat
,
"
but
he
was
a
queer
subject
altogether
---
a
kind
of
gipsy
---
one
of
the
finest
,
stand
-
up
men
,
you
ever
see
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
He
told
me
some
things
that
would
startle
you
a
bit
,
<EOS>
did
that
friend
of
mine
,
on
the
morning
when
he
died
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
were
with
him
at
the
time
,
were
you
?
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
he
answered
with
a
curious
look
,
"
I
was
there
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
yes
certainly
,
I
was
there
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
n't
have
gone
off
half
as
comfortable
without
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
been
with
three
or
four
of
his
family
under
the
same
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
all
fine
fellows
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
must
have
been
fond
of
you
,
"
remarked
Mr
Tappertit
,
looking
at
him
sideways
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
they
was
exactly
fond
of
me
,
"
said
Dennis
,
with
a
little
hesitation
,
"
but
they
all
had
me
near
'em
when
they
departed
.
 
<EOS>
I
come
in
for
their
wardrobes
too
.
 
<EOS>
This
very
handkecher
<EOS>
that
you
see
round
my
neck
,
belonged
to
him
that
I
've
been
speaking
of
---
him
as
did
that
likeness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Tappertit
glanced
at
the
article
referred
to
,
and
appeared
to
think
that
the
deceased
's
ideas
of
dress
were
of
a
peculiar
and
by
no
means
an
expensive
kind
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
no
remark
upon
the
point
,
however
,
and
suffered
his
mysterious
companion
to
proceed
without
interruption
.
  
<EOS>
"
These
smalls
,
"
said
Dennis
,
rubbing
his
legs
;
"
these
very
smalls
---
 
<EOS>
they
belonged
to
a
friend
of
mine
that
's
left
off
sich
incumbrances
for
ever
:
this
coat
too
---
I
've
often
walked
behind
this
coat
,
in
the
street
,
and
wondered
whether
it
would
ever
come
to
me
:
this
pair
of
shoes
have
danced
a
hornpipe
for
another
man
,
afore
my
eyes
,
full
half
-
a
-
dozen
times
at
least
:
and
as
to
my
hat
,
"
he
said
,
taking
it
off
,
and
whirling
it
round
upon
his
fist
---
"
Lord
!
<EOS>
I
've
seen
this
hat
go
up
Holborn
on
the
box
of
a
hackney
-
coach
---
ah
,
many
and
many
a
day
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
their
old
wearers
are
ALL
dead
,
I
hope
?
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
,
falling
a
little
distance
from
him
as
he
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
Every
one
of
'
em
,
"
replied
Dennis
.
 
<EOS>
"
Every
man
Jack
!
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
something
so
very
ghastly
in
this
circumstance
,
and
it
appeared
to
account
,
in
such
a
very
strange
and
dismal
manner
,
for
his
faded
dress
---
which
,
in
this
new
aspect
,
seemed
discoloured
by
the
earth
from
graves
---
that
Mr
Tappertit
abruptly
found
he
was
going
another
way
,
and
,
stopping
short
,
bade
him
good
night
with
the
utmost
heartiness
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
happened
to
be
near
the
Old
Bailey
,
and
Mr
Dennis
knew
there
were
turnkeys
in
the
lodge
with
whom
he
could
pass
the
night
,
and
discuss
professional
subjects
of
common
interest
among
them
before
a
rousing
fire
,
and
over
a
social
glass
,
he
separated
from
his
companions
without
any
great
regret
,
and
warmly
shaking
hands
with
Hugh
,
and
making
an
early
appointment
for
their
meeting
at
The
Boot
,
left
them
to
pursue
their
road
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
strange
sort
of
man
,
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
,
watching
the
hackney
-
coachman
's
hat
as
it
went
bobbing
down
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
to
make
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
Why
ca
n't
he
have
his
smalls
made
to
order
,
or
wear
live
clothes
at
any
rate
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
lucky
man
,
captain
,
"
cried
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
have
such
friends
as
his
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
he
do
n't
get
'em
to
make
their
wills
,
and
then
knock
'em
on
the
head
,
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
,
musing
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
come
.
 
<EOS>
The
United
B
's
expect
me
.
 
<EOS>
On
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
What
's
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
quite
forgot
,
"
said
Hugh
,
who
had
started
at
the
striking
of
a
neighbouring
clock
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
somebody
to
see
to
-
night
---
I
must
turn
back
directly
.
 
<EOS>
The
drinking
and
singing
put
it
out
of
my
head
.
<EOS>
It
's
well
<EOS>
I
remembered
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Tappertit
looked
at
him
as
though
he
were
about
to
give
utterance
to
some
very
majestic
sentiments
in
reference
to
this
act
of
desertion
,
but
as
it
was
clear
,
from
Hugh
's
hasty
manner
,
that
the
engagement
was
one
of
a
pressing
nature
,
he
graciously
forbore
,
and
gave
him
his
permission
to
depart
immediately
,
which
Hugh
acknowledged
with
a
roar
of
laughter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
night
,
captain
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
yours
to
the
death
,
remember
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Farewell
!
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
,
waving
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
bold
and
vigilant
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
Popery
,
captain
!
"
<EOS>
roared
Hugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
England
in
blood
first
!
"
cried
his
desperate
leader
.
 
<EOS>
Whereat
Hugh
cheered
and
laughed
,
and
ran
off
like
a
greyhound
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
man
will
prove
a
credit
to
my
corps
,
"
said
Simon
,
turning
thoughtfully
upon
his
heel
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
let
me
see
.
 
<EOS>
In
an
altered
state
of
society
---
which
must
ensue
if
we
break
out
and
are
victorious
---
 
when
the
locksmith
's
child
is
mine
,
Miggs
must
be
got
rid
of
somehow
,
or
she
'll
poison
the
tea

kettle
one
evening
when
I
'm
out

<EOS>
He
might
marry
Miggs
,
if
he
was
drunk
enough
.
 
<EOS>
It
shall
be
done

<EOS>
I
'll
make
a
note
of
it

Chapter
40
    
Little
thinking
of
the
plan
for
his
happy
settlement
in
life
which
had
suggested
itself
to
the
teeming
brain
of
his
provident
commander
<EOS>
,
Hugh
made
no
pause
until
Saint
Dunstan
's
giants
struck
the
hour
above
him
,
when
he
worked
the
handle
of
a
pump
which
stood
hard
by
,
with
great
vigour
,
and
thrusting
his
head
under
the
spout
,
let
the
water
gush
upon
him
until
a
little
stream
ran
down
from
every
uncombed
hair
,
and
he
was
wet
to
the
waist
.
 
<EOS>
Considerably
refreshed
by
this
ablution
,
both
in
mind
and
body
,
and
almost
sobered
for
the
time
,
he
dried
himself
as
he
best
could
;
then
crossed
the
road
,
and
plied
the
knocker
of
the
Middle
Temple
gate
.
  
<EOS>
The
night
-
porter
looked
through
a
small
grating
in
the
portal
with
a
surly
eye
,
and
cried
"
Halloa
!
"
<EOS>
which
greeting
Hugh
returned
in
kind
,
and
bade
him
open
quickly
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
do
n't
sell
beer
here
,
"
cried
the
man
;
"
what
else
do
you
want
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
come
in
,
"
Hugh
replied
,
with
a
kick
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
to
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Paper
Buildings
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whose
chambers
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Sir
John
Chester
's
.
"
 
<EOS>
Each
of
which
answers
,
he
emphasised
with
another
kick
.
  
<EOS>
After
a
little
growling
on
the
other
side
,
the
gate
was
opened
,
and
he
passed
in
:
undergoing
a
close
inspection
from
the
porter
as
he
did
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
YOU
wanting
Sir
John
,
at
this
time
of
night
!
"
said
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
"
said
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
!
 
<EOS>
What
of
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
must
go
with
you
and
see
that
you
do
,
for
I
do
n't
believe
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
along
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Eyeing
him
with
suspicious
looks
,
the
man
,
with
key
and
lantern
,
walked
on
at
his
side
,
and
attended
him
to
Sir
John
Chester
's
door
,
at
which
Hugh
gave
one
knock
,
that
echoed
through
the
dark
staircase
like
a
ghostly
summons
,
and
made
the
dull
light
tremble
in
the
drowsy
lamp
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
he
wants
me
now
?
"
said
Hugh
.
  
<EOS>
Before
the
man
had
time
to
answer
,
a
footstep
was
heard
within
,
a
light
appeared
,
and
Sir
John
,
in
his
dressing
-
gown
and
slippers
,
opened
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ask
your
pardon
,
Sir
John
,
"
said
the
porter
,
pulling
off
his
hat
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
's
a
young
man
says
he
wants
to
speak
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
late
for
strangers
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
it
best
to
see
that
all
was
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aha
!
"
cried
Sir
John
,
raising
his
eyebrows
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
you

messenger
,
is
it
?
 
<EOS>
Go
in

<EOS>
Quite
right

I
commend
your

highly

Thank

Good

<EOS>
"
  
To
be
commended
,
thanked
,
God
-
blessed
,
and
bade
good
night
by
one
who
carried
"
Sir

before
his
name
,
and
wrote
himself
MP
to
boot
,
was
something
for
a
porter
.
 
<EOS>
He
withdrew
with
much
humility
and
reverence
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
John
followed
his
late
visitor
into
the
dressing
-
room
,
and
sitting
in
his
easy
-
chair
before
the
fire
,
and
moving
it
so
that
he
could
see
him
as
he
stood
,
hat
in
hand
,
beside
the
door
,
looked
at
him
from
head
to
foot
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
face
,
calm
and
pleasant
as
ever
;
the
complexion
,
quite
juvenile
in
its
bloom
and
clearness
;
the
same
smile
;
the
wonted
precision
and
elegance
of
dress
;
the
white
,
well
-
ordered
teeth
;
the
delicate
hands
;
the
composed
and
quiet
manner
;
everything
as
it
used
to
be
:
no
mark
of
age
or
passion
,
envy
,
hate

or
discontent
:
all
unruffled
and
serene
,
and
quite
delightful
to
behold
.
  
<EOS>
He
wrote
himself
MP
---
but
how
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
thus
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
proud
family
---
 
more
proud
,
indeed
,
than
wealthy
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
stood
in
danger
of
arrest
;
of
bailiffs
,
and
a
jail
---
a
vulgar
jail
,
to
which
the
common
people
with
small
incomes
went
.
 
<EOS>
Gentlemen
of
ancient
houses
have
no
privilege
of
exemption
from
such
cruel
laws
---
unless
they
are
of
one
great
house
,
and
then
they
have
.
 
<EOS>
A
proud
man
of
his
stock
and
kindred
had
the
means
of
sending
him
there
.
 
<EOS>
He
offered
---
not
indeed
to
pay
his
debts
,
but
<EOS>
to
let
him
sit
for
a
close
borough
until
his
own
son
came
of
age
,
which
,
if
he
lived
,
would
come
to
pass
in
twenty
years
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
quite
as
good
as
an
Insolvent
Act
,
and
infinitely
more
genteel
.
 
<EOS>
So
Sir
John
Chester
was
a
member
of
Parliament
.
  
<EOS>
But
how
Sir
John
?
 
<EOS>
Nothing
so
simple
,
or
so
easy
.
 
<EOS>
One
touch
with
a
sword
of
state
,
and
the
transformation
was
effected
.
 
<EOS>
John
Chester
,
Esquire
,
MP
,
attended
court
---
went
up
with
an
address
---
headed
a
deputation
.
 
<EOS>
Such
elegance
of
manner
,
so
many
graces
of
deportment
,
such
powers
of
conversation
,
could
never
pass
unnoticed
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
was
too
common
for
such
merit
.
 
<EOS>
A
man
so
gentlemanly
should
have
been
---
 
but
Fortune
is
capricious
---
born
a
Duke
:
just
as
some
dukes
should
have
been
born
labourers
.
 
<EOS>
He
caught
the
fancy
of
the
king
,
knelt
down
a
grub
,
and
rose
a
butterfly
.
 
<EOS>
John
Chester
,
Esquire
,
was
knighted
and
became
Sir
John
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
when
you
left
me
this
evening
,
my
esteemed
acquaintance
,
"
said
Sir
John
after
a
pretty
long
silence
,
"
that
you
intended
to
return
with
all
despatch
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
did
,
master
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
you
have
?
<EOS>
"
he
retorted
,
glancing
at
his
watch
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
that
what
you
would
say
?
"
  
Instead
of
replying
,
Hugh
changed
the
leg
on
which
he
leant
,
shuffled
his
cap
from
one
hand
to
the
other
,
looked
at
the
ground
,
the
wall
,
the
ceiling
,
and
finally
at
Sir
John
himself
;
before
whose
pleasant
face
he
lowered
his
eyes
again
,
and
fixed
them
on
the
floor
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
have
you
been
employing
yourself
in
the
meanwhile
?
"
<EOS>
quoth
Sir
John
,
lazily
crossing
his
legs
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
have
you
been
?
<EOS>
what
harm
have
you
been
doing
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
harm
at
all
,
master
,
"
growled
Hugh
,
with
humility
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
only
done
as
you
ordered
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
As
I
WHAT
?
"
returned
Sir
John
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
then
,
"
said
Hugh
uneasily
,
"
as
you
advised
,
or
said
I
ought
,
or
said
I
might
,
or
said
that
you
would
do
,
if
you
was
me
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
so
hard
upon
me
,
master
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Something
like
an
expression
of
triumph
in
the
perfect
control
he
had
established
over
this
rough
instrument
appeared
in
the
knight
's
face
for
an
instant
;
but
it
vanished
directly
,
as
he
said
---
paring
his
nails
while
speaking
:
  
<EOS>
"
When
you
say
I
ordered
you
,
my
good
fellow
,
you
imply
that
I
directed
you
to
do
something
for
me
---
<EOS>
something
I
wanted
done
---
 
something
for
my
own
ends
and
purposes
<EOS>
---
you
see
?
 
<EOS>
Now
I
am
sure
I
need
n't
enlarge
upon
the
extreme
absurdity
of
such
an
idea
,
however
unintentional
;
so
please
---
"
and
here
he
turned
his
eyes
upon
him
---
 
"
to
be
more
guarded
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
meant
to
give
you
no
offence
,
"
said
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
You
catch
me
up
so
very
short
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
caught
up
much
shorter
,
my
good
friend
---
infinitely
shorter
---
one
of
these
days
,
depend
upon
it
,
"
replied
his
patron
calmly
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
-
the
-
bye
,
instead
of
wondering
why
you
have
been
so
long
,
my
wonder
should
be
why
you
came
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
Why
did
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
master
,
"
said
Hugh
,
"
that
I
could
n't
read
the
bill
I
found
,
and
that
supposing
it
to
be
something
particular
from
the
way
it
was
wrapped
up
,
I
brought
it
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
could
you
ask
no
one
else
to
read
it
,
Bruin
?
"
said
Sir
John
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
one
that
I
could
trust
with
secrets
,
master
.
 
<EOS>
Since
Barnaby
Rudge
was
lost
sight
of
for
good
and
all
---
and
that
's
five
years
ago
---
I
have
n't
talked
with
any
one
but
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
done
me
honour
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
to
and
fro
,
master
,
all
through
that
time
,
when
there
was
anything
to
tell
,
because
I
knew
that
you
'd
be
angry
with
me
if
I
stayed
away
,
"
said
Hugh
,
blurting
the
words
out
,
after
an
embarrassed
silence
;
"
<EOS>
and
because
I
wished
to
please
you
if
I
could
,
and
not
to
have
you
go
against
me
.
 
<EOS>
There
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
true
reason
why
I
came
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
that
,
master
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
specious
fellow
,
"
returned
Sir
John
,
fixing
his
eyes
upon
him
,
"
and
carry
two
faces
under
your
hood
,
as
well
as
the
best
.
 
<EOS>
Did
n't
you
give
me
in
this
room
,
this
evening
,
any
other
reason
;
no
dislike
of
anybody
who
has
slighted
you
lately
,
on
all
occasions
,
abused
you
,
treated
you
with
rudeness
;
acted
towards
you
,
more
as
if
you
were
a
mongrel
dog
than
a
man
like
himself
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
be
sure
I
did
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Hugh
,
his
passion
rising
,
as
the
other
meant
it
should
;
"
and
I
say
it
all
over
now
,
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
do
anything
to
have
some
revenge
on
him
---
anything
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
you
told
me
that
he
and
all
the
Catholics
would
suffer
from
those
who
joined
together
under
that
handbill
,
I
said
I
'd
make
one
of
'em
,
if
their
master
was
the
devil
himself
.
 
<EOS>
I
AM
one
of
'em
.
 
<EOS>
See
whether
I
am
as
good
as
my
word
and
turn
out
to
be
among
the
foremost
,
or
no
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
n't
have
much
head
,
master
,
but
I
've
head
enough
to
remember
those
that
use
me
ill
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
see
,
and
so
shall
he
,
and
so
shall
<EOS>
hundreds
more
,
how
my
spirit
backs
me
when
the
time
comes
.
<EOS>
My
bark
is
nothing
to
my
bite
.
 
<EOS>
Some
that
I
know
had
better
have
a
wild
lion
among
'em
than
me
,
when
I
am
fairly
loose
---
they
had
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
knight
looked
at
him
with
a
smile
of
far
deeper
meaning
than
ordinary
;
and
pointing
to
the
old
cupboard
,
followed
him
with
his
eyes
while
he
filled
and
drank
a
glass
of
liquor
;
and
smiled
when
his
back
was
turned
,
with
deeper
meaning
yet
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
in
a
blustering
mood
,
my
friend
,
"
he
said
,
when
Hugh
confronted
him
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
I
,
master
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
say
half
<EOS>
I
mean
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
.
<EOS>
I
have
n't
got
the
gift
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
talkers
enough
among
us
;
I
'll
be
one
of
the
doers
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
!
you
have
joined
those
fellows
then
?
"
said
Sir
John
,
with
an
air
of
most
profound
indifference
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
up
to
the
house
you
told
me
of
;
and
got
put
down
upon
the
muster
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
another
man
there
,
named
Dennis
---
"
  
"
Dennis
,
eh
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Sir
John
,
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
!
<EOS>
a
pleasant
fellow
,
I
believe
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
A
roaring
dog
,
master
---
one
after
my
own
heart
---
hot
upon
the
matter
too
---
red
hot
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
So
I
have
heard
,
"
replied
Sir
John
,
carelessly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
happen
to
know
his
trade
,
do
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
would
n't
say
,
"
cried
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
keeps
it
secret
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ha
ha
!
"
laughed
Sir
John
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
strange
fancy
---
a
weakness
with
some
persons
<EOS>
---
you
'll
know
it
<EOS>
one
day
,
I
dare
swear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
're
intimate
already
,
"
said
Hugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
natural
!
 
<EOS>
And
have
been
drinking
together
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
pursued
Sir
John
.
 
<EOS>
"
Did
you
say
what
place
you
went
to
in
company
,
when
you
left
Lord
George
's
?
"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
had
not
said
or
thought
of
saying
,
but
he
told
him
;
and
this
inquiry
being
followed
by
a
long
train
of
questions
,
he
related
all
that
had
passed
both
in
and
out
of
doors
,
the
kind
of
people
he
had
seen
,
their
numbers
,
state
of
feeling
,
mode
of
conversation
,
apparent
expectations
and
intentions
.
 
<EOS>
His
questioning
was
so
artfully
contrived
,
that
he
seemed
even
in
his
own
eyes
to
volunteer
all
this
information
rather
than
to
have
it
wrested
from
him
;
and
he
was
brought
to
this
state
of
feeling
so
naturally
,
that
when
Mr
Chester
yawned
at
length
and
declared
himself
quite
wearied
out
,
he
made
a
rough
kind
of
excuse
for
having
talked
so
much
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
---
get
you
gone
,
"
said
Sir
John
,
holding
the
door
open
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
made
a
pretty
evening
's
work
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
you
not
to
do
this
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
get
into
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
have
an
opportunity
of
revenging
yourself
on
your
proud
friend
Haredale
,
though
,
and
for
that
,
you
'd
hazard
anything
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
would
,
"
retorted
Hugh
,
stopping
in
his
passage
out
and
looking
back
;
"
but
what
do
I
risk
!
 
<EOS>
What
do
I
stand
a
chance
of
losing
,
master
?
 
<EOS>
Friends
,
home
?
 
<EOS>
A
fig
for
'em
all
<EOS>
;
I
have
none
;
they
are
nothing
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Give
me
a
good
scuffle
;
let
me
pay
off
old
scores
in
a
bold
riot
where
there
are
men
to
stand
by
me
;
and
then
use
me
as
you
like
<EOS>
---
it
do
n't
matter
much
to
me
what
the
end
is
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
done
with
that
paper
?
"
said
Sir
John
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
it
here
,
master
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Drop
it
again
as
you
go
along
;
it
's
as
well
not
to
keep
such
things
about
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
nodded
,
and
touching
his
cap
with
an
air
of
as
much
respect
as
he
could
summon
up
,
departed
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
John
,
fastening
the
doors
behind
him
,
went
back
to
his
dressing
-
room
,
and
sat
down
once
again
before
the
fire
,
at
which
he
gazed
for
a
long
time
,
in
earnest
meditation
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
happens
fortunately
,
"
he
said
,
breaking
into
a
smile
,
"
and
promises
well
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
see
.
 
<EOS>
My
relative
and
I
,
who
are
the
most
Protestant
fellows
in
the
world
,
give
our
worst
wishes
to
the
Roman
Catholic
cause
;
and
to
Saville
,
who
introduces
their
bill
,
I
have
a
personal
objection
besides
;
but
as
each
of
us
has
himself
for
the
first
article
in
his
creed
,
we
can
not
commit
ourselves
by
joining
with
a
very
extravagant
madman
,
such
as
this
Gordon
most
undoubtedly
is
.
 
<EOS>
Now
really
,
to
foment
his
disturbances
in
secret
,
through
the
medium
of
such
a
very
apt
instrument
as
my
savage
friend
here
,
may
further
our
real
ends
;
and
to
express
at
all
becoming
seasons
,
in
moderate
and
polite
terms
,
a
disapprobation
of
his
proceedings
,
though
we
agree
with
him
in
principle
,
will
certainly
be
to
gain
a
character
for
honesty
and
uprightness
of
purpose
,
which
can
not
fail
to
do
us
infinite
service
,
and
to
raise
us
into
some
importance
.
 
<EOS>
Good
!
 
<EOS>
So
much
for
public
grounds
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
private
considerations
,
I
confess
that
if
these
vagabonds
WOULD
make
some
riotous
demonstration
(
which
does
not
appear
impossible
)
,
and
WOULD
inflict
some
little
chastisement
on
Haredale
as
a
not
inactive
man
among
his
sect
,
it
would
be
extremely
agreeable
to
my
feelings
,
and
would
amuse
me
beyond
measure
.
 
<EOS>
Good
again
!
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
better
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
he
came
to
this
point
,
he
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
;
then
beginning
slowly
to
undress
,
he
resumed
his
meditations
,
by
saying
with
a
smile
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
fear
,
I
DO
fear
exceedingly
,
that
my
friend
is
following
fast
in
the
footsteps
of
his
mother
.
 
<EOS>
His
intimacy
with
Mr
Dennis
is
very
ominous
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
have
no
doubt
he
must
have
come
to
that
end
any
way
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
lend
him
a
helping
hand
,
the
only
difference
is
,
that
he
may
,
upon
the
whole
,
possibly
drink
a
few
gallons
,
or
puncheons
,
or
hogsheads
,
less
in
this
life
than
he
otherwise
would
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
no
business
of
mine
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
matter
of
very
small
importance
!

<EOS>
So
he
took
another
pinch
of
snuff
,
and
went
to
bed

Chapter
41
    
From
the
workshop
of
the
Golden
Key
,
there
issued
forth
a
tinkling
sound
,
so
merry
and
good
-
humoured
,
that
it
suggested
the
idea
of
some
one
working
blithely
,
and
made
quite
pleasant
music
.
 
<EOS>
No
man
who
hammered
on
at
a
dull
monotonous
duty
,
could
have
brought
such
cheerful
notes
from
steel
and
iron
;
none
but
a
chirping
,
healthy
,
honest
-
hearted
fellow
,
who
made
the
best
of
everything
,
and
felt
kindly
towards
everybody
,
could
have
done
it
for
an
instant
.
 
<EOS>
He
might
have
been
a
coppersmith
,
and
still
been
musical
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
had
sat
in
a
jolting
waggon
,
full
of
rods
of
iron
,
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
have
brought
some
harmony
out
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Tink
,
tink
,
tink
---
clear
as
a
silver
bell
,
and
audible
at
every
pause
of
the
streets
'
harsher
noises
,
as
though
it
said
,
"
I
do
n't
care
;
nothing
puts
me
out
;
I
am
resolved
to
he
happy
.
"
 
<EOS>
Women
scolded
,
children
squalled
,
heavy
carts
went
rumbling
by
,
horrible
cries
proceeded
from
the
lungs
of
hawkers
;
still
it
struck
in
again
,
no
higher
,
no
lower
,
no
louder
,
no
softer
;
not
thrusting
itself
on
people
's
notice
a
bit
the
more
for
having
been
outdone
by
louder
sounds
---
tink
,
tink
,
tink
,
tink
,
tink
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
perfect
embodiment
of
the
still
small
voice
,
free
from
all
cold
,
hoarseness
,
huskiness
,
or
unhealthiness
of
any
kind
;
foot
-
passengers
slackened
their
pace
,
and
were
disposed
to
linger
near
it
;
neighbours
who
had
got
up
splenetic
that
morning
,
felt
good
-
humour
stealing
on
them
as
they
heard
it
,
and
by
degrees
became
quite
sprightly
;
mothers
danced
their
babies
to
its
ringing
;
still
the
same
magical
tink
,
tink
,
tink
,
came
gaily
from
the
workshop
of
the
Golden
Key
.
  
<EOS>
Who
but
the
locksmith
could
have
made
such
music
!
 
<EOS>
A
gleam
of
sun
shining
through
the
unsashed
window
,
and
chequering
the
dark
workshop
with
a
broad
patch
of
light
,
fell
full
upon
him
,
as
though
attracted
by
his
sunny
heart
.
 
<EOS>
There
he
stood
working
at
his
anvil
,
his
face
all
radiant
with
exercise
and
gladness
,
his
sleeves
turned
up
,
his
wig
pushed
off
his
shining
forehead
---
the
easiest
,
freest
,
happiest
man
in
all
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
Beside
him
sat
a
sleek
cat
,
purring
and
winking
in
the
light
,
and
falling
every
now
and
then
into
an
idle
doze
,
as
from
excess
of
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
Toby
looked
on
from
a
tall
bench
hard
by
;
one
beaming
smile
,
from
his
broad
nut
-
brown
face
down
to
the
slack
-
baked
buckles
in
his
shoes
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
locks
that
hung
around
had
something
jovial
in
their
rust
,
and
seemed
like
gouty
gentlemen
of
hearty
natures
,
disposed
to
joke
on
their
infirmities
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
surly
or
severe
in
the
whole
scene
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
impossible
that
any
one
of
the
innumerable
keys
could
fit
a
churlish
strong
-
box
or
a
prison
-
door
.
 
<EOS>
Cellars
of
beer
and
wine
,
rooms
where
there
were
fires
,
books
,
gossip
,
and
cheering
laughter
---
 
<EOS>
these
were
their
proper
sphere
of
action
.
 
<EOS>
Places
of
distrust
and
cruelty
,
and
restraint
,
they
would
have
left
quadruple
-
locked
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
Tink
,
tink
,
tink
.
 
<EOS>
The
locksmith
paused
at
last
,
and
wiped
his
brow
.
 
<EOS>
The
silence
roused
the
cat
,
who
,
jumping
softly
down
,
crept
to
the
door
,
and
watched
with
tiger
eyes
a
bird
-
cage
in
an
opposite
window
.
 
<EOS>
Gabriel
lifted
Toby
to
his
mouth
,
and
took
a
hearty
draught
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
as
he
stood
upright
,
with
his
head
flung
back
,
and
his
portly
chest
thrown
out
,
you
would
have
seen
that
Gabriel
's
lower
man
was
clothed
in
military
gear
.
 
<EOS>
Glancing
at
the
wall
beyond
,
there
might
have
been
espied
,
hanging
on
their
several
pegs
,
a
cap
and
feather
,
broadsword
,
sash
,
and
coat
of
scarlet
;
which
any
man
learned
in
such
matters
would
have
known
from
their
make
and
pattern
to
be
the
uniform
of
a
serjeant
in
the
Royal
East
London
Volunteers
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
locksmith
put
his
mug
down
,
empty
,
on
the
bench
whence
it
had
smiled
on
him
before
,
he
glanced
at
these
articles
with
a
laughing
eye
,
and
looking
at
them
with
his
head
a
little
on
one
side
,
as
though
he
would
get
them
all
into
a
focus
,
said
,
leaning
on
his
hammer
:
  
<EOS>
"
Time
was
,
now
,
I
remember
,
when
I
was
like
to
run
mad
with
the
desire
to
wear
a
coat
of
that
colour
.
 
<EOS>
If
any
one
(
except
my
father
)
had
called
me
a
fool
for
my
pains
,
how
I
should
have
fired
and
fumed
!
 
<EOS>
But
what
a
fool
I
must
have
been
,
sure
-
ly
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
sighed
Mrs
Varden
,
who
had
entered
unobserved
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
fool
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
A
man
at
your
time
of
life
,
Varden
,
should
know
better
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
a
ridiculous
woman
you
are
,
Martha
,
"
said
the
locksmith
,
turning
round
with
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
replied
Mrs
V
with
great
demureness
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
,
Varden
.
 
<EOS>
Thank
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
---
"
began
the
locksmith
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
his
wife
,
"
I
know
what
you
mean
.
 
<EOS>
You
speak
quite
plain
enough
to
be
understood
,
Varden
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
very
kind
of
you
to
adapt
yourself
to
my
capacity
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Tut
,
tut
,
Martha
,
"
rejoined
the
locksmith
;
"
do
n't
take
offence
at
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
,
how
strange
it
is
of
you
to
run
down
volunteering
,
when
it
's
done
to
defend
you
and
all
the
other
women
,
and
our
own
fireside
and
everybody
else
's
,
in
case
of
need
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
unchristian
,
"
cried
Mrs
Varden
,
shaking
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Unchristian
!
"
said
the
locksmith
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
the
devil
---
"
  
Mrs
Varden
looked
at
the
ceiling
,
as
in
expectation
that
the
consequence
of
this
profanity
would
be
the
immediate
descent
of
the
four
-
post
bedstead
on
the
second
floor
,
together
with
the
best
sitting
-
room
on
the
first
;
but
no
visible
judgment
occurring
,
she
heaved
a
deep
sigh
,
and
begged
her
husband
,
in
a
tone
of
resignation
,
to
go
on
,
and
by
all
means
to
blaspheme
as
much
as
possible
,
because
he
knew
she
liked
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
locksmith
did
for
a
moment
seem
disposed
to
gratify
her
,
but
he
gave
a
great
gulp
,
and
mildly
rejoined
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
going
to
say
,
what
on
earth
do
you
call
it
unchristian
for
?
<EOS>
Which
would
be
most
unchristian
,
Martha
---
to
sit
quietly
down
and
let
our
houses
be
sacked
by
a
foreign
army
,
or
to
turn
out
like
men
and
drive
'em
off
?
 
<EOS>
Should
n't
I
be
a
nice
sort
of
a
Christian
,
if
I
crept
into
a
corner
of
my
own
chimney
and
looked
on
while
a
parcel
of
whiskered
savages
bore
off
Dolly
---
or
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
he
said
"
or
you
,
"
Mrs
Varden
,
despite
herself
,
relaxed
into
a
smile
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
something
complimentary
in
the
idea
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
such
a
state
of
things
as
that
,
indeed
---
"
she
simpered
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
that
!
"
repeated
the
locksmith
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
that
would
be
the
state
of
things
directly
.
 
<EOS>
Even
Miggs
would
go
.
 
<EOS>
Some
black
tambourine
-
player
,
with
a
great
turban
on
,
would
be
bearing
HER
off
,
and
,
unless
the
tambourine
-
player
was
proof
against
kicking
and
scratching
,
it
's
my
belief
<EOS>
he
'd
have
the
worst
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
ha
ha
!
<EOS>
I
'd
forgive
the
tambourine
-
player
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
have
him
interfered
with
on
any
account
,
poor
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
here
the
locksmith
laughed
again
so
heartily
,
that
tears
came
into
his
eyes
---
much
to
Mrs
Varden
's
indignation
,
who
thought
the
capture
of
so
sound
a
Protestant
and
estimable
a
private
character
as
Miggs
by
a
pagan
negro
,
a
circumstance
too
shocking
and
awful
for
contemplation
.
  
<EOS>
The
picture
Gabriel
had
drawn
,
indeed
,
threatened
serious
consequences
,
and
would
indubitably
have
led
to
them
,
but
luckily
at
that
moment
a
light
footstep
crossed
the
threshold
,
and
Dolly
,
running
in
,
threw
her
arms
round
her
old
father
's
neck
and
hugged
him
tight
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
she
is
at
last
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Gabriel
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
how
well
you
look
,
Doll
,
and
how
late
you
are
,
my
darling
!
"
  
<EOS>
How
well
she
looked
?
 
<EOS>
Well
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
if
he
had
exhausted
every
laudatory
adjective
in
the
dictionary
,
it
would
n't
have
been
praise
enough
.
 
<EOS>
When
and
where
was
there
ever
such
a
plump
,
roguish
,
comely
,
bright
-
eyed
,
enticing
,
bewitching
,
captivating
,
maddening
little
puss
in
all
this
world
,
as
Dolly
!
 
<EOS>
What
was
the
Dolly
of
five
years
ago
,
to
the
Dolly
of
that
day
!
 
<EOS>
How
many
coachmakers
,
saddlers
,
cabinet
-
makers
,
and
professors
of
other
useful
arts
,
had
deserted
their
fathers
,
mothers
,
sisters
,
brothers
,
and
,
most
of
all
,
their
cousins
,
for
the
love
of
her

<EOS>
How
many
unknown
gentlemen
---
supposed
to
be
of
mighty
fortunes
,
if
not
titles
---
had
waited
round
the
corner
after
dark
,
and
tempted
Miggs
the
incorruptible
,
with
golden
guineas
,
to
deliver
offers
of
marriage
folded
up
in
love
-
letters
!
 
<EOS>
How
many
disconsolate
fathers
and
substantial
tradesmen
had
waited
on
the
locksmith
for
the
same
purpose
,
with
dismal
tales
of
how
their
sons
had
lost
their
appetites
,
and
taken
to
shut
themselves
up
in
dark
bedrooms
,
and
wandering
in
desolate
suburbs
with
pale
faces
,
and
all
because
of
Dolly
Varden
's
loveliness
and
cruelty
!
 
<EOS>
How
many
young
men
,
in
all
previous
times
of
unprecedented
steadiness
,
had
turned
suddenly
wild
and
wicked
for
the
same
reason
,
and
,
in
an
ecstasy
of
unrequited
love
,
taken
to
wrench
off
door
-
knockers
,
and
invert
the
boxes
of
rheumatic
watchmen
!
 
<EOS>
How
had
she
recruited
the
king
's
service
,
both
by
sea
and
land
,
through
rendering
desperate
his
loving
subjects
between
the
ages
of
eighteen
and
twenty
-
five
!
 
<EOS>
How
many
young
ladies
had
publicly
professed
,
with
tears
in
their
eyes
,
that
for
their
tastes
she
was
much
too
short
,
too
tall
,
too
bold
,
too
cold
,
too
stout
,
too
thin
,
too
fair
,
too
dark
---
too
everything
but
handsome
!
 
<EOS>
How
many
old
ladies
,
taking
counsel
together
,
had
thanked
Heaven
their
daughters
were
not
like
her
,
and
had
hoped
she
might
come
to
no
harm
,
and
had
thought
she
would
come
to
no
good
,
and
had
wondered
what
people
saw
in
her
,
and
had
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
she
was
"
going
off
"
in
her
looks
,
or
had
never
come
on
in
them
,
and
that
she
was
a
thorough
imposition
and
a
popular
mistake
!
  
<EOS>
And
yet
here
was
this
same
Dolly
Varden
,
so
whimsical
and
hard
to
please
that
she
was
Dolly
Varden
still
,
all
smiles
and
dimples
and
pleasant
looks
,
and
caring
no
more
for
the
fifty
or
sixty
young
fellows
who
at
that
very
moment
were
breaking
their
hearts
to
marry
her
,
than
if
so
many
oysters
had
been
crossed
in
love
and
opened
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
Dolly
hugged
her
father
as
has
been
already
stated
,
and
having
hugged
her
mother
also
,
accompanied
both
into
the
little
parlour
where
the
cloth
was
already
laid
for
dinner
,
and
where
Miss
Miggs
---
 
a
trifle
more
rigid
and
bony
than
of
yore
---
received
her
with
a
sort
of
hysterical
gasp
,
intended
for
a
smile
.
 
<EOS>
Into
the
hands
of
that
young
virgin
,
she
delivered
her
bonnet
and
walking
dress
(
all
of
a
dreadful
,
artful
,
and
designing
kind
)
,
and
then
said
with
a
laugh
,
which
rivalled
the
locksmith
's
music
,
"
How
glad
I
always
am
to
be
at
home
again
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
glad
we
always
are
,
Doll
,
"
said
her
father
,
putting
back
the
dark
hair
from
her
sparkling
eyes
,
"
to
have
you
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
Give
me
a
kiss
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
If
there
had
been
anybody
of
the
male
kind
there
to
see
her
do
it
---
 
<EOS>
but
there
was
not
---
it
was
a
mercy
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
like
your
being
at
the
Warren

"
said
the
locksmith
,
"
I
ca
n't
bear

you
out

And
what

over
yonder

<EOS>
"
What

replied
his

"
I

"
Ay

cried
the

"
What

<EOS>
"
  
"
Come
,
come
,
"
said
Dolly
,
"
you
know
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
you
to
tell
me
why
Mr
Haredale
---
<EOS>
oh
,
how
gruff
he
is
again
,
to
be
sure
!
---
<EOS>
has
been
away
from
home
for
some
days
past
,
and
why
he
is
travelling
about
(
we
know
he
IS
travelling
,
because
of
his
letters
)
without
telling
his
own
niece
<EOS>
why
or
wherefore
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Miss
Emma
does
n't
want
to
know
,
I
'll
swear
,
"
returned
the
locksmith
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
,
"
said
Dolly
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
,
at
any
rate
.
 
<EOS>
Do
tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
Why
is
he
so
secret
,
and
what
is
this
ghost
story
,
which
nobody
is
to
tell
Miss
Emma
,
and
which
seems
to
be
mixed
up
with
his
going
away
?
 
<EOS>
Now
I
see
you
know
by
your
colouring
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
the
story
means
,
or
is
,
or
has
to
do
with
it
,
I
know
no
more
than
you
,
my
dear
,
"
returned
the
locksmith
,
"
except
that
it
's
some
foolish
fear
of
little
Solomon
's
---
which
has
,
indeed
,
no
meaning
in
it
,
I
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
Mr
Haredale
's
journey
,
he
goes
,
as
I
believe
---
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
"
said
Dolly
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
I
believe
,
"
resumed
the
locksmith
,
pinching
her
cheek
,
"
on
business
,
Doll
.
 
<EOS>
What
it
may
be
,
is
quite
another
matter
.
 
<EOS>
Read
Blue
Beard
,
and
do
n't
be
too
curious
,
pet
;
it
's
no
business
of
yours
or
mine
,
depend
upon
that
;
and
here
's
dinner
,
which
is
much
more
to
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dolly
might
have
remonstrated
against
this
summary
dismissal
of
the
subject
,
notwithstanding
the
appearance
of
dinner
,
but
at
the
mention
of
Blue
Beard
Mrs
Varden
interposed
,
protesting
she
could
not
find
it
in
her
conscience
to
sit
tamely
by
,
and
hear
her
child
recommended
to
peruse
the
adventures
of
a
Turk
and
Mussulman
---
far
less
of
a
fabulous
Turk
,
which
she
considered
that
potentate
to
be
.
<EOS>
She
held
that
,
in
such
stirring
and
tremendous
times
as
those
in
which
they
lived
,
it
would
be
much
more
to
the
purpose
if
Dolly
became
a
regular
subscriber
to
the
Thunderer
,
where
she
would
have
an
opportunity
of
reading
Lord
George
Gordon
's
speeches
word
for
word
,
which
would
be
a
greater
comfort
and
solace
to
her
,
than
a
hundred
and
fifty
Blue
Beards
ever
could
impart
.
 
<EOS>
She
appealed
in
support
of
this
proposition
to
Miss
Miggs
,
then
in
waiting
,
who
said
that
indeed
the
peace
of
mind
she
had
derived
from
the
perusal
of
that
paper
generally
,
but
especially
of
one
article
of
the
very
last
week
as
ever
was
,
entitled
"
Great
Britain
drenched
in
gore
,
"
<EOS>
exceeded
all
belief
;
the
same
composition
,
she
added
,
had
also
wrought
such
a
comforting
effect
on
the
mind
of
a
married
sister
of
hers
,
then
resident
at
Golden
Lion
Court
,
number
twenty
-
sivin
,
second
bell
-
handle
on
the
right
-
hand
door
-
post
,
that
,
being
in
a
delicate
state
of
health
,
and
in
fact
expecting
an
addition
to
her
family
,
she
had
been
seized
with
fits
directly
after
its
perusal
,
and
had
raved
of
the
Inquisition
ever
since
;
to
the
great
improvement
of
her
husband
and
friends
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Miggs
went
on
to
say
that
she
would
recommend
all
those
whose
hearts
were
hardened
to
hear
Lord
George
themselves
,
whom
she
commended
first
,
in
respect
of
his
steady
Protestantism
,
then
of
his
oratory
,
then
of
his
eyes
,
then
of
his
nose
,
then
of
his
legs
,
and
lastly
of
his
figure
generally
,
which
she
looked
upon
as
fit
for
any
statue
,
prince
,
or
angel
,
to
which
sentiment
Mrs
Varden
fully
subscribed
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
having
cut
in
,
looked
at
a
box
upon
the
mantelshelf
,
painted
in
imitation
of
a
very
red
-
brick
dwelling
-
house
,
with
a
yellow
roof
;
having
at
top
a
real
chimney
,
down
which
voluntary
subscribers
dropped
their
silver
,
gold
,
or
pence
,
into
the
parlour
;
and
on
the
door
the
counterfeit
presentment
of
a
brass
plate
,
whereon
was
legibly
inscribed
"
Protestant
Association
:
"
---
and
looking
at
it
,
said
,
that
it
was
to
her
a
source
of
poignant
misery
to
think
that
Varden
never
had
,
of
all
his
substance
,
dropped
anything
into
that
temple
,
save
once
in
secret
---
as
she
afterwards
discovered
---
two
fragments
of
tobacco
-
pipe
,
which
she
hoped
would
not
be
put
down
to
his
last
account
.
 
<EOS>
That
Dolly
,
she
was
grieved
to
say
,
was
no
less
backward
in
her
contributions
,
better
loving
,
as
it
seemed
,
to
purchase
ribbons
and
such
gauds
,
than
to
encourage
the
great
cause
,
then
in
such
heavy
tribulation
;
and
that
she
did
entreat
her
(
her
father
she
much
feared
could
not
be
moved
)
not
to
despise
,
but
imitate
,
the
bright
example
of
Miss
Miggs
,
who
flung
her
wages
,
as
it
were
,
into
the
very
countenance
of
the
Pope
,
and
bruised
his
features
with
her
quarter
's
money
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
mim
,
"
said
Miggs
,
"
do
n't
relude
to
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
no
intentions
,
mim
,
that
nobody
should
know
.
 
<EOS>
Such
sacrifices
as
I
can
make
,
are
quite
a
widder
's
mite
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
all
I
have
,
"
cried
Miggs
with
a
great
burst
of
tears
---
for
with
her
<EOS>
they
never
came
on
by
degrees
---
"
but
it
's
made
up
to
me
in
other
ways
;
it
's
well
made
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
quite
true
,
though
not
perhaps
in
the
sense
that
Miggs
intended
.
 
<EOS>
As
she
never
failed
to
keep
her
self
-
denial
full
in
Mrs
Varden
's
view
,
it
drew
forth
so
many
gifts
of
caps
and
gowns
and
other
articles
of
dress
,
that
upon
the
whole
the
red
-
brick
house
was
perhaps
the
best
investment
for
her
small
capital
she
could
possibly
have
hit
upon
;
returning
her
interest
,
at
the
rate
of
seven
or
eight
per
cent
in
money
,
and
fifty
at
least
in
personal
repute
and
credit
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
n't
cry
,
Miggs
,
"
said
Mrs
Varden
,
herself
in
tears
;
"
you
need
n't
be
ashamed
of
it
,
though
your
poor
mistress
IS
on
the
same
side
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miggs
howled
at
this
remark
,
in
a
peculiarly
dismal
way
,
and
said
she
knowed
that
master
hated
her
.
 
<EOS>
That
it
was
a
dreadful
thing
to
live
in
families
and
have
dislikes
,
and
not
give
satisfactions
.
<EOS>
That
to
make
divisions
was
a
thing
she
could
not
abear
to
think
of
,
neither
could
her
feelings
let
her
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
That
if
it
was
master
's
wishes
<EOS>
as
she
and
him
should
part
<EOS>
,
it
was
best
they
should
part
,
and
she
hoped
he
might
be
the
happier
for
it
,
and
always
wished
him
well
,
and
that
he
might
find
somebody
as
would
meet
his
dispositions
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
hard
trial
,
she
said
,
to
part
from
such
a
missis
,
but
she
could
meet
any
suffering
when
her
conscience
told
her
she
was
in
the
rights
,
and
therefore
she
was
willing
even
to
go
that
lengths
.
 
<EOS>
She
did
not
think
,
she
added
,
that
she
could
long
survive
the
separations
,
but
,
as
she
was
hated
and
looked
upon
unpleasant
,
perhaps
her
dying
as
soon
as
possible
would
be
the
best
endings
for
all
parties
.
 
<EOS>
With
this
affecting
conclusion
,
Miss
Miggs
shed
more
tears
,
and
sobbed
abundantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
bear
this
,
Varden
?
"
said
his
wife
in
a
solemn
voice
,
laying
down
her
knife
and
fork
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
not
very
well
,
my
dear
,
"
rejoined
the
locksmith
,
"
but
I
try
to
keep
my
temper
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
let
there
be
words
on
my
account
,
mim
,
"
sobbed
Miggs
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
much
the
best
that
we
should
part
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
stay
---
<EOS>
oh
,
gracious
me
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
and
make
dissensions
,
not
for
a
annual
gold
mine
,
and
found
in
tea
and
sugar
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lest
the
reader
should
be
at
any
loss
to
discover
the
cause
of
Miss
Miggs
's
deep
emotion
,
it
may
be
whispered
apart
that
,
happening
to
be
listening
,
as
her
custom
sometimes
was
,
when
Gabriel
and
his
wife
conversed
together
<EOS>
,
she
had
heard
the
locksmith
's
joke
relative
to
the
foreign
black
who
played
the
tambourine
,
and
bursting
with
the
spiteful
feelings
which
the
taunt
awoke
in
her
fair
breast
,
exploded
in
the
manner
we
have
witnessed
.
 
<EOS>
Matters
having
now
arrived
at
a
crisis
,
the
locksmith
,
as
usual
,
and
for
the
sake
of
peace
and
quietness
,
gave
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
crying
for
,
girl
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
with
you
?
 
<EOS>
What
are
you
talking
about
hatred
for
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
hate
you
;
I
do
n't
hate
anybody
.
 
<EOS>
Dry
your
eyes
and
make
yourself
agreeable
,
in
Heaven
's
name
,
and
let
us
all
be
happy
while
we
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
allied
powers
deeming
it
good
generalship
to
consider
this
a
sufficient
apology
on
the
part
of
the
enemy
,
and
confession
of
having
been
in
the
wrong
,
did
dry
their
eyes
and
take
it
in
good
part
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Miggs
observed
that
she
bore
no
malice
,
no
not
to
her
greatest
foe
,
whom
she
rather
loved
the
more
indeed
,
the
greater
persecution
she
sustained
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
approved
of
this
meek
and
forgiving
spirit
in
high
terms
,
and
incidentally
declared
as
a
closing
article
of
agreement
,
that
Dolly
should
accompany
her
to
the
Clerkenwell
branch
of
the
association
,
that
very
night
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
an
extraordinary
instance
of
her
great
prudence
and
policy
;
having
had
this
end
in
view
from
the
first
,
and
entertaining
a
secret
misgiving
that
the
locksmith
(
who
was
bold
when
Dolly
was
in
question
)
would
object
,
she
had
backed
Miss
Miggs
up
to
this
point
,
in
order
that
she
might
have
him
at
a
disadvantage
.
 
<EOS>
The
manoeuvre
succeeded
so
well
that
Gabriel
only
made
a
wry
face
,
and
with
the
warning
he
had
just
had
,
fresh
in
his
mind
,
did
not
dare
to
say
one
word
.
  
<EOS>
The
difference
ended
,
therefore
,
in
Miggs
being
presented
with
a
gown
by
Mrs
Varden
and
half
-
a
-
crown
by
Dolly
,
as
if
she
had
eminently
distinguished
herself
in
the
paths
of
morality
and
goodness
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
V
,
according
to
custom
,
expressed
her
hope
that
Varden
would
take
a
lesson
from
what
had
passed
and
learn
more
generous
conduct
for
the
time
to
come
;
and
the
dinner
being
now
cold
and
nobody
's
appetite
very
much
improved
by
what
had
passed
,
they
went
on
with
it
,
as
Mrs
Varden
said
,
"
like
Christians
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
there
was
to
be
a
grand
parade
of
the
Royal
East
London
Volunteers
<EOS>
that
afternoon
,
the
locksmith
did
no
more
work
;
but
sat
down
comfortably
with
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
,
and
his
arm
round
his
pretty
daughter
's
waist
,
looking
lovingly
on
Mrs
V
,
from
time
to
time
,
and
exhibiting
from
the
crown
of
his
head
to
the
sole
of
his
foot
,
one
smiling
surface
of
good
humour
.
 
<EOS>
And
to
be
sure
,
when
it
was
time
to
dress
him
in
his
regimentals
,
and
Dolly
,
hanging
about
him
in
all
kinds
of
graceful
winning
ways
,
helped
to
button
and
buckle
and
brush
him
up
and
get
him
into
one
of
the
tightest
coats
that
ever
was
made
by
mortal
tailor
,
he
was
the
proudest
father
in
all
England
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
handy
jade
it
is
!
"
said
the
locksmith
to
Mrs
Varden
,
who
stood
by
with
folded
hands
---
rather
proud
of
her
husband
too
---
while
Miggs
held
his
cap
and
sword
at
arm
's
length
,
as
if
mistrusting
that
the
latter
might
run
some
one
through
the
body
of
its
own
accord
;
"
but
never
marry
a
soldier
,
Doll
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dolly
did
n't
ask
why
not
,
or
say
a
word
,
indeed
,
but
stooped
her
head
down
very
low
to
tie
his
sash
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
wear
this
dress
,
"
said
honest
Gabriel
,
"
but
I
think
of
poor
Joe
Willet
.
 
<EOS>
I
loved
Joe
;
he
was
always
a
favourite
of
mine
.
<EOS>
Poor
Joe
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Dear
heart
,
my
girl
,
do
n't
tie
me
in
so
tight
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dolly
laughed
---
not
like
herself
at
all
---
the
strangest
little
laugh
that
could
be
---
and
held
her
head
down
lower
still
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Joe
!
"
resumed
the
locksmith
,
muttering
to
himself
;
"
I
always
wish
he
had
come
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
might
have
made
it
up
between
them
,
if
he
had
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
old
John
made
a
great
mistake
in
his
way
of
acting
by
that
lad
---
a
great
mistake
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Have
you
nearly
tied
that
sash
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
What
an
ill
-
made
sash
it
was
!
 
<EOS>
There
it
was
,
loose
again
and
trailing
on
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
Dolly
was
obliged
to
kneel
down
,
and
recommence
at
the
beginning
.
  
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
young
Willet
,
Varden
,
"
said
his
wife
frowning
;
"
you
might
find
some
one
more
deserving
to
talk
about
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Miggs
gave
a
great
sniff
to
the
same
effect
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
Martha
,
"
cried
the
locksmith
,
"
do
n't
let
us
bear
too
hard
upon

<EOS>
If
the
lad
is
dead
indeed
,
we
'll
deal
kindly
by
his
memory

"
A
runaway
and
a
vagabond
!
"
said
Mrs
Varden
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Miggs
expressed
her
concurrence
as
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
runaway
,
my
dear
,
but
not
a
vagabond
,
"
returned
the
locksmith
in
a
gentle
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
behaved
himself
well
,
did
Joe
---
always
---
and
was
a
handsome
,
manly
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
call
him
a
vagabond
,
Martha
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
coughed
---
and
so
did
Miggs
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
tried
hard
to
gain
your
good
opinion
,
Martha
,
I
can
tell
you
,
"
said
the
locksmith
smiling
,
and
stroking
his
chin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
that
he
did
.
 
<EOS>
It
seems
but
yesterday
that
he
followed
me
out
to
the
Maypole
door
one
night
,
and
begged
me
not
to
say
how
like
a
boy
they
used
him
---
say
here
,
at
home
,
he
meant
,
though
at
the
time
,
I
recollect
,
I
did
n't
understand
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
how
's
Miss
Dolly
,
sir
?
"
says
Joe
,
"
pursued
the
locksmith
,
musing
sorrowfully
,
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
Poor
Joe
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
declare
,
"
cried
Miggs
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
Goodness
gracious
me
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
now
?
"
said
Gabriel
,
turning
sharply
to
her
,
"
Why
,
if
here
an't
Miss
Dolly
,
"
said
the
handmaid
,
stooping
down
to
look
into
her
face
,
"
a
-
giving
way
to
floods
of
tears
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
mim
!
<EOS>
oh
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Raly
<EOS>
it
's
give
me
such
a
turn
,
"
cried
the
susceptible
damsel
,
pressing
her
hand
upon
her
side
to
quell
the
palpitation
of
her
heart
,
"
that
you
might
knock
me
down
with
a
feather
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
locksmith
,
after
glancing
at
Miss
Miggs
as
if
he
could
have
wished
to
have
a
feather
brought
straightway
,
looked
on
with
a
broad
stare
while
Dolly
hurried
away
,
followed
by
that
sympathising
young
woman
:
then
turning
to
his
wife
,
stammered
out
,
"
Is
Dolly
ill
?
 
<EOS>
Have
I
done
anything
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
my
fault
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Your
fault
!
"
cried
Mrs
V
reproachfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
---
you
had
better
make
haste
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
have
I
done
?
"
said
poor
Gabriel
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
agreed
that
Mr
Edward
's
name
was
never
to
be
mentioned
,
and
I
have
not
spoken
of
him
,
have
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
merely
replied
that
she
had
no
patience
with
him
,
and
bounced
off
after
the
other
two
.
 
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
locksmith
wound
his
sash
about
him
,
girded
on
his
sword
,
put
on
his
cap
,
and
walked
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
much
of
a
dab
at
my
exercise
,
"
he
said
under
his
breath
,
"
but
I
shall
get
into
fewer
scrapes
at
that
work
than
at
this
.
<EOS>
Every
man
came
into
the
world
for
something
;
my
department
seems
to
be
to
make
every
woman
cry
without
meaning
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
rather
hard
!
"
  
<EOS>
But
he
forgot
it
before
he
reached
the
end
of
the
street
,
and
went
on
with
a
shining
face
,
nodding
to
the
neighbours
,
and
showering
about
his
friendly
greetings
like
mild
spring
rain
.

Chapter
42
    
<EOS>
The
Royal
East
London
Volunteers
made
a
brilliant
sight
that
day
:
formed
into
lines
,
squares
,
circles
,
triangles
,
and
what
not
,
to
the
beating
of
drums
,
and
the
streaming
of
flags
;
and
performed
a
vast
number
of
complex
evolutions
,
in
all
of
which
Serjeant
Varden
bore
a
conspicuous
share
.
 
<EOS>
Having
displayed
their
military
prowess
to
the
utmost
in
these
warlike
shows
,
they
marched
in
glittering
order
to
the
Chelsea
Bun
House
,
and
regaled
in
the
adjacent
taverns
until
dark
.
 
<EOS>
Then
at
sound
of
drum
they
fell
in
again
,
and
returned
amidst
the
shouting
of
His
Majesty
's
lieges
to
the
place
from
whence
they
came
.
  
<EOS>
The
homeward
march
being
somewhat
tardy
,
---
owing
to
the
un
-
soldierlike
behaviour
of
certain
corporals
,
who
,
being
gentlemen
of
sedentary
pursuits
in
private
life
and
excitable
out
of
doors
,
broke
several
windows
with
their
bayonets
,
and
rendered
it
imperative
on
the
commanding
officer
to
deliver
them
over
to
a
strong
guard
,
with
whom
they
fought
at
intervals
as
they
came
along
,
---
it
was
nine
o'clock
when
the
locksmith
reached
home
.
 
<EOS>
A
hackney
-
coach
was
waiting
near
his
door
;
and
as
he
passed
it
,
Mr
Haredale
looked
from
the
window
and
called
him
by
his
name
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
sight
of
you
is
good
for
sore
eyes
,
sir
,
"
said
the
locksmith
,
stepping
up
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
had
walked
in
though
,
rather
than
waited
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
nobody
at
home
,
I
find
,
"
Mr
Haredale
answered
;
"
besides
,
I
desired
to
be
as
private
as
I
could
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
"
muttered
the
locksmith
,
looking
round
at
his
house
.
"
<EOS>
Gone
with
Simon
Tappertit
to
that
precious
Branch
,
no
doubt
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
invited
him
to
come
into
the
coach
,
and
,
if
he
were
not
tired
or
anxious
to
go
home
,
to
ride
with
him
a
little
way
that
they
might
have
some
talk
together
.
 
<EOS>
Gabriel
cheerfully
complied
,
and
the
coachman
mounting
his
box
drove
off
.
  
<EOS>
"
Varden
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
after
a
minute
's
pause
,
"
you
will
be
amazed
to
hear
what
errand
I
am
on
;
it
will
seem
a
very
strange
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
it
's
a
reasonable
one
,
sir
,
and
has
a
meaning
in
it
,
"
replied
the
locksmith
;
"
or
it
would
not
be
yours
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
just
come
back
to
town
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
half
an
hour
ago
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bringing
no
news
of
Barnaby
,
or
his
mother
?
"
said
the
locksmith
dubiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
you
need
n't
shake
your
head
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
wild
-
goose
chase
.
 
<EOS>
I
feared
that
,
from
the
first
.
 
<EOS>
You
exhausted
all
reasonable
means
of
discovery
when
they
went
away
.
 
<EOS>
To
begin
again
after
so
long
a
time
has
passed
is
hopeless
,
sir
---
quite
hopeless
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
where
are
they
?
"
<EOS>
he
returned
impatiently
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
can
they
be
?
 
<EOS>
Above
ground
?
"
  
"
God
knows
,
"
rejoined
the
locksmith
,
"
many
that
I
knew
above
it
five
years
ago
,
have
their
beds
under
the
grass
now
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
world
is
a
wide
place
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
hopeless
attempt
,
sir
,
believe
me
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
leave
the
discovery
of
this
mystery
,
like
all
others
,
to
time
,
and
accident
,
and
Heaven
's
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Varden
,
my
good
fellow
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
"
I
have
a
deeper
meaning
in
my
present
anxiety
to
find
them
out
,
than
you
can
fathom
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
a
mere
whim
;
it
is
not
the
casual
revival
of
my
old
wishes
and
desires
;
but
an
earnest
,
solemn
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
My
thoughts
and
dreams
all
tend
to
it
,
and
fix
it
in
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
rest
by
day
or
night
;
I
have
no
peace
or
quiet
;
I
am
haunted
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
voice
was
so
altered
from
its
usual
tones
,
and
his
manner
bespoke
so
much
emotion
,
that
Gabriel
,
in
his
wonder
,
could
only
sit
and
look
towards
him
in
the
darkness
,
and
fancy
the
expression
of
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
not
ask
me
,
"
continued
Mr
Haredale
,
"
to
explain
myself
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
were
to
do
so
,
you
would
think
me
the
victim
of
some
hideous
fancy
.
<EOS>
It
is
enough
that
this
is
so
,
and
that
I
can
not
---
<EOS>
no
,
I
can
not
---
lie
quietly
in
my
bed
,
without
doing
what
will
seem
to
you
incomprehensible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Since
when
,
sir
,
"
said
the
locksmith
after
a
pause
,
"
has
this
uneasy
feeling
been
upon
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
hesitated
for
some
moments
,
and
then
replied
:
"
Since
the
night
of
the
storm
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
since
the
last
nineteenth
of
March
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
though
he
feared
that
Varden
might
express
surprise
,
or
reason
with
him
,
he
hastily
went
on
:
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
think
,
I
know
,
I
labour
under
some
delusion
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
is
not
a
morbid
one
;
it
is
a
wholesome
action
of
the
mind
,
reasoning
on
actual
occurrences
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
the
furniture
remains
in
Mrs
Rudge
's
house
,
and
that
it
has
been
shut
up
,
by
my
orders
,
since
she
went
away
,
save
once
a
-
week
or
so
,
when
an
old
neighbour
visits
it
to
scare
away
the
rats
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
on
my
way
there
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
what
purpose
?
"
asked
the
locksmith
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
pass
the
night
there
,
"
he
replied
;
"
and
not
to
-
night
alone
,
but
many
nights
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
a
secret
which
I
trust
to
you
in
case
of
any
unexpected
emergency
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
not
come
,
unless
in
case
of
strong
necessity
,
to
me
;
from
dusk
to
broad
day
I
shall
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
Emma
,
your
daughter
,
and
the
rest
,
suppose
me
out
of
London
,
as
I
have
been
until
within
this
hour
.
 
<EOS>
Do
not
undeceive
them
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
errand
I
am
bound
upon
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
I
may
confide
it
to
you
,
and
I
rely
upon
your
questioning
me
no
more
at
this
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
,
as
if
to
change
the
theme
,
he
led
the
astounded
locksmith
back
to
the
night
of
the
Maypole
highwayman
,
to
the
robbery
of
Edward
Chester
,
to
the
reappearance
of
the
man
at
Mrs
Rudge
's
house
,
and
to
all
the
strange
circumstances
which
afterwards
occurred
.
 
<EOS>
He
even
asked
him
carelessly
about
the
man
's
height
,
his
face
,
his
figure
,
whether
he
was
like
any
one
he
had
ever
seen
---
like
Hugh
,
for
instance
,
or
any
man
he
had
known
at
any
time
---
and
put
many
questions
of
that
sort
,
which
the
locksmith
,
considering
them
as
mere
devices
to
engage
his
attention
and
prevent
his
expressing
the
astonishment
he
felt
,
answered
pretty
much
at
random
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
,
they
arrived
at
the
corner
of
the
street
in
which
the
house
stood
,
where
Mr
Haredale
,
alighting
,
dismissed
the
coach
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
desire
to
see
me
safely
lodged
,
"
he
said
,
turning
to
the
locksmith
with
a
gloomy
smile
,
"
you
can
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gabriel
,
to
whom
all
former
marvels
had
been
nothing
in
comparison
with
this
,
followed
him
along
the
narrow
pavement
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
reached
the
door
,
Mr
Haredale
softly
opened
it
with
a
key
he
had
about
him
,
and
closing
it
when
Varden
entered
,
they
were
left
in
thorough
darkness
.
  
<EOS>
They
groped
their
way
into
the
ground
-
floor
room
.
 
<EOS>
Here
Mr
Haredale
struck
a
light
,
and
kindled
a
pocket
taper
he
had
brought
with
him
for
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
then
,
when
the
flame
was
full
upon
him
,
that
the
locksmith
saw
for
the
first
time
how
haggard
,
pale
,
and
changed
he
looked
;
how
worn
and
thin
he
was
;
how
perfectly
his
whole
appearance
coincided
with
all
that
he
had
said
so
strangely
as
they
rode
along
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
an
unnatural
impulse
in
Gabriel
,
after
what
he
had
heard
,
to
note
curiously
the
expression
of
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
perfectly
collected
and
rational
;
---
 
so
much
<EOS>
so
,
indeed
,
that
he
felt
ashamed
of
his
momentary
suspicion
,
and
drooped
his
own
when
Mr
Haredale
looked
towards
him
,
as
if
he
feared
they
would
betray
his
thoughts
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
walk
through
the
house
?
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
with
a
glance
towards
the
window
,
the
crazy
shutters
of
which
were
closed
and
fastened
.
 
<EOS>
"
Speak
low
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
kind
of
awe
about
the
place
,
which
would
have
rendered
it
difficult
to
speak
in
any
other
manner
.
 
<EOS>
Gabriel
whispered
"
Yes
,
"
and
followed
him
upstairs
.
  
<EOS>
Everything
was
just
as
they
had
seen
it
last
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
sense
of
closeness
from
the
exclusion
of
fresh
air
,
and
a
gloom
and
heaviness
around
,
as
though
long
imprisonment
had
made
the
very
silence
sad
.
 
<EOS>
The
homely
hangings
of
the
beds
and
windows
had
begun
to
droop
;
the
dust
lay
thick
upon
their
dwindling
folds
;
and
damps
had
made
their
way
through
ceiling
,
wall
,
and
floor
.
 
<EOS>
The
boards
creaked
beneath
their
tread
,
as
if
resenting
the
unaccustomed
intrusion
;
nimble
spiders
,
paralysed
by
the
taper
's
glare
,
checked
the
motion
of
their
hundred
legs
upon
the
wall
,
or
dropped
like
lifeless
things
upon
the
ground
;
the
death
-
watch
ticked
;
and
the
scampering
feet
of
rats
and
mice
rattled
behind
the
wainscot
.
  
<EOS>
As
they
looked
about
them
on
the
decaying
furniture
,
it
was
strange
to
find
how
vividly
it
presented
those
to
whom
it
had
belonged
,
and
with
whom
it
was
once
familiar
.
 
<EOS>
Grip
seemed
to
perch
again
upon
his
high
-
backed
chair
;
Barnaby
to
crouch
in
his
old
favourite
corner
by
the
fire
;
the
mother
to
resume
her
usual
seat
,
and
watch
him
as
of
old
.
 
<EOS>
Even
when
they
could
separate
these
objects
from
the
phantoms
of
the
mind
which
they
invoked
,
the
latter
only
glided
out
of
sight
,
but
lingered
near
them
still
;
for
then
they
seemed
to
lurk
in
closets
and
behind
the
doors
,
ready
to
start
out
and
suddenly
accost
them
in
well
-
remembered
tones
.
  
<EOS>
They
went
downstairs
,
and
again
into
the
room
they
had
just
now
left
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
unbuckled
his
sword
and
laid
it
on
the
table
,
with
a
pair
of
pocket
pistols
;
then
told
the
locksmith
he
would
light
him
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
this
is
a
dull
place
,
sir
,
"
said
Gabriel
lingering
;
"
may
no
one
share
your
watch
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
shook
his
head
,
and
so
plainly
evinced
his
wish
to
be
alone
,
that
Gabriel
could
say
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
In
another
moment
the
locksmith
was
standing
in
the
street
,
whence
he
could
see
that
the
light
once
more
travelled
upstairs
,
and
soon
returning
to
the
room
below
,
shone
brightly
through
the
chinks
of
the
shutters
.
  
<EOS>
If
ever
man
were
sorely
puzzled
and
perplexed
,
the
locksmith
was
,
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
Even
when
snugly
seated
by
his
own
fireside
,
with
Mrs
Varden
opposite
in
a
nightcap
and
night
-
jacket
,
and
Dolly
beside
him
(
in
a
most
distracting
dishabille
)
curling
her
hair
,
and
smiling
as
if
she
had
never
cried
in
all
her
life
and
never
could
---
 
even
then
,
with
Toby
at
his
elbow
and
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
,
and
Miggs
<EOS>
(
but
that
perhaps
was
not
much
)
falling
asleep
in
the
background
<EOS>
,
he
could
not
quite
discard
his
wonder
and
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
So
in
his
dreams
---
still
there
was
Mr
Haredale
,
haggard
and
careworn
,
listening
in
the
solitary
house
to
every
sound
that
stirred
,
with
the
taper
shining
through
the
chinks
until
the
day
should
turn
it
pale
and
end
his
lonely
watching
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
43
    
<EOS>
Next
morning
brought
no
satisfaction
to
the
locksmith
's
thoughts
,
nor
next
day
,
nor
the
next
,
nor
many
others
.
 
<EOS>
Often
after
nightfall
he
entered
the
street
,
and
turned
his
eyes
towards
the
well
-
known
house
;
and
as
surely
as
he
did
so
,
there
was
the
solitary
light
,
still
gleaming
through
the
crevices
of
the
window
-
shutter
,
while
all
within
was
motionless
,
noiseless
,
cheerless
,
as
a
grave
.
<EOS>
Unwilling
to
hazard
Mr
Haredale
's
favour
by
disobeying
his
strict
injunction
,
he
never
ventured
to
knock
at
the
door
or
to
make
his
presence
known
in
any
way
.
 
<EOS>
But
whenever
strong
interest
and
curiosity
attracted
him
to
the
spot
---
which
was
not
seldom
---
the
light
was
always
there
.
  
<EOS>
If
he
could
have
known
what
passed
within
,
the
knowledge
would
have
yielded
him
no
clue
to
this
mysterious
vigil
.
 
<EOS>
At
twilight
,
Mr
Haredale
shut
himself
up
,
and
at
daybreak
he
came
forth
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
missed
a
night
,
always
came
and
went
alone
,
and
never
varied
his
proceedings
in
the
least
degree
.
  
<EOS>
The
manner
of
his
watch
was
this
.
 
<EOS>
At
dusk
,
he
entered
the
house
in
the
same
way
as
when
the
locksmith
bore
him
company
,
kindled
a
light
,
went
through
the
rooms
,
and
narrowly
examined
them
.
 
<EOS>
That
done
,
he
returned
to
the
chamber
on
the
ground
-
floor
,
and
laying
his
sword
and
pistols
on
the
table
,
sat
by
it
until
morning
.
  
<EOS>
He
usually
had
a
book
with
him
,
and
often
tried
to
read
,
but
never
fixed
his
eyes
or
thoughts
upon
it
for
five
minutes
together
.
 
<EOS>
The
slightest
noise
without
doors
,
caught
his
ear
;
a
step
upon
the
pavement
seemed
to
make
his
heart
leap
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
not
without
some
refreshment
during
the
long
lonely
hours
;
generally
carrying
in
his
pocket
a
sandwich
of
bread
and
meat
,
and
a
small
flask
of
wine
.
 
<EOS>
The
latter
diluted
with
large
quantities
of
water
,
he
drank
in
a
heated
,
feverish
way
,
as
though
his
throat
were
dried
;
but
he
scarcely
ever
broke
his
fast
,
by
so
much
as
a
crumb
of
bread
.
  
<EOS>
If
this
voluntary
sacrifice
of
sleep
and
comfort
had
its
origin
,
as
the
locksmith
on
consideration
was
disposed
to
think
,
in
any
superstitious
expectation
of
the
fulfilment
of
a
dream
or
vision
connected
with
the
event
on
which
he
had
brooded
for
so
many
years
,
and
if
he
waited
for
some
ghostly
visitor
who
walked
abroad
when
men
lay
sleeping
in
their
beds
,
he
showed
no
trace
of
fear
or
wavering
.
 
<EOS>
His
stern
features
expressed
inflexible
resolution
;
his
brows
were
puckered
,
and
his
lips
compressed
,
with
deep
and
settled
purpose
;
and
when
he
started
at
a
noise
and
listened
,
it
was
not
with
the
start
of
fear
but
hope
,
and
catching
up
his
sword
as
though
the
hour
had
come
at
last
,
he
would
clutch
it
in
his
tight
-
clenched
hand
,
and
listen
with
sparkling
eyes
and
eager
looks
,
until
it
died
away
.
  
<EOS>
These
disappointments
were
numerous
,
for
they
ensued
on
almost
every
sound
,
but
his
constancy
was
not
shaken
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
every
night
he
was
at
his
post
,
the
same
stern
,
sleepless
,
sentinel
;
and
still
night
passed
,
and
morning
dawned
,
and
he
must
watch
again
.
  
<EOS>
This
went
on
for
weeks
;
he
had
taken
a
lodging
at
Vauxhall
in
which
to
pass
the
day
and
rest
himself
;
and
from
this
place
,
when
the
tide
served
,
he
usually
came
to
London
Bridge
from
Westminster
by
water
,
in
order
that
he
might
avoid
the
busy
streets
.
  
<EOS>
One
evening
,
shortly
before
twilight
,
he
came
his
accustomed
road
upon
the
river
's
bank
,
intending
to
pass
through
Westminster
Hall
into
Palace
Yard
,
and
there
take
boat
to
London
Bridge
as
usual
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
pretty
large
concourse
of
people
assembled
round
the
Houses
of
Parliament
,
looking
at
the
members
as
they
entered
and
departed
,
and
giving
vent
to
rather
noisy
demonstrations
of
approval
or
dislike
,
according
to
their
known
opinions
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
made
his
way
among
the
throng
,
he
heard
once
or
twice
the
No
-
Popery
cry
,
which
was
then
becoming
pretty
familiar
to
the
ears
of
most
men
;
but
holding
it
in
very
slight
regard
,
and
observing
that
the
idlers
were
of
the
lowest
grade
,
he
neither
thought
nor
cared
about
it
,
but
made
his
way
along
,
with
perfect
indifference
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
many
little
knots
and
groups
of
persons
in
Westminster
Hall
:
some
few
looking
upward
at
its
noble
ceiling
,
and
at
the
rays
of
evening
light
,
tinted
by
the
setting
sun
,
which
streamed
in
aslant
through
its
small
windows
,
and
growing
dimmer
by
degrees
,
were
quenched
in
the
gathering
gloom
below
;
some
,
noisy
passengers
,
mechanics
going
home
from
work
,
and
otherwise
,
who
hurried
quickly
through
,
waking
the
echoes
with
their
voices
,
and
soon
darkening
the
small
door
in
the
distance
,
as
they
passed
into
the
street
beyond
;
some
,
in
busy
conference
together
on
political
or
private
matters
,
pacing
slowly
up
and
down
with
eyes
that
sought
the
ground
,
and
seeming
,
by
their
attitudes
,
to
listen
earnestly
from
head
to
foot
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
a
dozen
squabbling
urchins
made
a
very
Babel
in
the
air
;
there
,
a
solitary
man
,
half
clerk
,
half
mendicant
,
paced
up
and
down
with
hungry
dejection
in
his
look
and
gait
;
at
his
elbow
passed
an
errand
-
lad
,
swinging
his
basket
round
and
round
,
and
with
his
shrill
whistle
riving
the
very
timbers
of
the
roof
;
while
a
more
observant
schoolboy
,
half
-
way
through
,
pocketed
his
ball
,
and
eyed
the
distant
beadle
as
he
came
looming
on
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
that
time
of
evening
<EOS>
when
,
if
you
shut
your
eyes
and
open
them
again
,
the
darkness
of
an
hour
appears
to
have
gathered
in
a
second
.
 
<EOS>
The
smooth
-
worn
pavement
,
dusty
with
footsteps
,
still
called
upon
the
lofty
walls
to
reiterate
the
shuffle
and
the
tread
of
feet
unceasingly
,
save
when
the
closing
of
some
heavy
door
resounded
through
the
building
like
a
clap
of
thunder
,
and
drowned
all
other
noises
in
its
rolling
sound
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
,
glancing
only
at
such
of
these
groups
as
he
passed
nearest
to
,
and
<EOS>
then
in
a
manner
betokening
that
his
thoughts
were
elsewhere
,
had
nearly
traversed
the
Hall
,
when
two
persons
before
him
caught
his
attention
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
these
,
a
gentleman
in
elegant
attire
,
carried
in
his
hand
a
cane
,
which
he
twirled
in
a
jaunty
manner
as
he
loitered
on
<EOS>
;
the
other
,
an
obsequious
,
crouching
,
fawning
figure
,
listened
to
what
he
said
---
at
times
throwing
in
a
humble
word
himself
---
and
,
with
his
shoulders
shrugged
up
to
his
ears
,
rubbed
his
hands
submissively
,
or
answered
at
intervals
by
an
inclination
of
the
head
,
half
-
way
between
a
nod
of
acquiescence
,
and
a
bow
of
most
profound
respect
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
abstract
there
was
nothing
very
remarkable
in
this
pair
,
for
servility
waiting
on
a
handsome
suit
of
clothes
and
a
cane
---
not
to
speak
of
gold
and
silver
sticks
,
or
wands
of
office
---
is
common
enough
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
was
that
about
the
well
-
dressed
man
,
yes
,
and
about
the
other
likewise
,
which
struck
Mr
Haredale
with
no
pleasant
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
He
hesitated
,
stopped
,
and
would
have
stepped
aside
and
turned
out
of
his
path
,
but
at
the
moment
,
the
other
two
faced
about
quickly
,
and
stumbled
upon
him
before
he
could
avoid
them
.
  
<EOS>
The
gentleman
with
the
cane
lifted
his
hat
and
had
begun
to
tender
an
apology
,
which
Mr
Haredale
had
begun
as
hastily
to
acknowledge
and
walk
away
,
when
he
stopped
short
and
cried
,
"
Haredale
!
 
<EOS>
Gad
bless
me
,
this
is
strange
indeed
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
"
he
returned
impatiently
;
"
yes
---
a
---
"
  
"
<EOS>
My
dear
friend
,
"
cried
the
other
,
detaining
him
,
"
why
such
great
speed
?
 
<EOS>
One
minute
,
Haredale
,
for
the
sake
of
old
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
in
haste
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Neither
of
us
has
sought
this
meeting
.
<EOS>
Let
it
be
a
brief
one
.
 
<EOS>
Good
night
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Fie
,
fie
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Sir
John
(
for
it
was
he
)
,
"
how
very
churlish
!
<EOS>
We
were
speaking
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
Your
name
was
on
my
lips
<EOS>
---
perhaps
you
heard
me
mention
it
?
 
<EOS>
No
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
really
sorry
.
<EOS>
---
You
know
our
friend
here
,
Haredale
?
 
<EOS>
This
is
really
a
most
remarkable
meeting
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
friend
,
plainly
very
ill
at
ease
,
had
made
bold
to
press
Sir
John
's
arm
,
and
to
give
him
other
significant
hints
that
he
was
desirous
of
avoiding
this
introduction
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
did
not
suit
Sir
John
's
purpose
,
however
,
that
it
should
be
evaded
,
he
appeared
quite
unconscious
of
these
silent
remonstrances
,
and
inclined
his
hand
towards
him
,
as
he
spoke
,
to
call
attention
to
him
more
particularly
.
  
<EOS>
The
friend
,
therefore
,
had
nothing
for
it
,
but
to
muster
up
the
pleasantest
smile
he
could
,
and
to
make
a
conciliatory
bow
,
as
Mr
Haredale
turned
his
eyes
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
Seeing
that
he
was
recognised
,
he
put
out
his
hand
in
an
awkward
and
embarrassed
manner
,
which
was
not
mended
by
its
contemptuous
rejection
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Gashford
!
"
said
Haredale
,
coldly
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
as
I
have
heard
then
.
<EOS>
You
have
left
the
darkness
for
the
light
,
sir
,
and
hate
those
whose
opinions
you
formerly
held
,
with
all
the
bitterness
of
a
renegade
.
<EOS>
You
are
an
honour
,
sir
,
to
any
cause
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
the
one
you
espouse
at
present
,
much
joy
of
the
acquisition
it
has
made
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
secretary
rubbed
his
hands
and
bowed
,
as
though
he
would
disarm
his
adversary
by
humbling
himself
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
John
Chester
again
exclaimed
,
with
an
air
of
great
gaiety
,
"
Now
,
really
,
this
is
a
most
remarkable
meeting
!
"
and
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
with
his
usual
self
-
possession
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Haredale
,
"
said
Gashford
,
stealthily
raising
his
eyes
,
and
letting
them
drop
again
when
they
met
the
other
's
steady
gaze
,
is
too
conscientious
,
too
honourable
,
too
manly
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
,
to
attach
unworthy
motives
to
an
honest
change
of
opinions
,
even
though
it
implies
a
doubt
of
those
he
holds
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
is
too
just
,
too
generous
,
too
clear
-
sighted
in
his
moral
vision
,
to
---
"
  
"
Yes
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
he
rejoined
with
a
sarcastic
smile
,
finding
the
secretary
stopped
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
were
saying
"
---
   
<EOS>
Gashford
meekly
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
and
looking
on
the
ground
again
,
was
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
but
let
us
really
,
"
interposed
Sir
John
at
this
juncture
,
"
let
us
really
,
for
a
moment
,
contemplate
the
very
remarkable
character
of
this
meeting
.
 
<EOS>
Haredale
,
my
dear
friend
,
pardon
me
if
I
think
you
are
not
sufficiently
impressed
with
its
singularity
.
 
<EOS>
Here
we
stand
,
by
no
previous
appointment
or
arrangement
,
three
old
schoolfellows
,
in
Westminster
Hall
;
three
old
boarders
in
a
remarkably
dull
and
shady
seminary
at
Saint
Omer
's
,
where
you
,
being
Catholics
and
of
necessity
educated
out
of
England
,
were
brought
up
;
and
where
I
,
being
a
promising
young
Protestant
at
that
time
,
was
sent
to
learn
the

Add
to
the
singularity
,
Sir
John
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
"
that
some
of
you
<EOS>
Protestants
of
promise
are
<EOS>
at
this
moment
leagued
in
yonder
building
,
to
prevent
our
having
the
surpassing
and
unheard
-
of
privilege
of
teaching
our
children
to
read
and
write
---
here
---
in
this
land
,
where
thousands
of
us
enter
your
service
every
year
,
and
to
preserve
the
freedom
of
which
,
we
die
in
bloody
battles
abroad
,
in
heaps
:
and
that
others
of
you
,
to
the
number
of
some
thousands
as
I
learn
,
are
led
on
to
look
on
all
men
of
my
creed
as
wolves
and
beasts
of
prey
,
by
this
man
Gashford
.
 
<EOS>
Add
to
it
besides
the
bare
fact
that
this
man
lives
in
society
,
walks
the
streets
in
broad
day
---
I
was
about
to
say
,
holds
up
his
head
,
but
that
he
does
not

and
it
will
be
strange
,
and
very
strange
,
I
grant
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
you
are
hard
upon
our
friend

replied
Sir
John
,
with
an
engaging
smile

<EOS>
"
You
are
really
very
hard
upon
our
friend

"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
him
go
on

Sir

said
Gashford
,
fumbling
with
his
gloves
.
<EOS>
"
Let
him
go
on

<EOS>
I
can
make
allowances
,
Sir

.
 
<EOS>
I
am
honoured
with
your
good
opinion
,
and
I
can
dispense
with
Mr

<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
is
a
sufferer
from
the
penal

I

his

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
so
much
of
my
favour
,
sir

"
retorted
Mr
Haredale
,
with
a
bitter
glance
at
the
third
party
in
their
conversation
,
"
that
I
am
glad
to
see
you
in
such
good
company

<EOS>
You
are
the
essence
of
your
great
Association

<EOS>
"
  
"
Now
,
there
you
mistake
,
"
said
Sir
John
,
in
his
most
benignant
way
.
<EOS>
"
There
---
which
is
a
most
remarkable
circumstance
for
a
man
of
your
punctuality
and
exactness
,
Haredale
---
you
fall
into
error
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
belong
to
the
body
;
I
have
an
immense
respect
for
its
members
,
but
I
do
n't
belong
to
it
;
although
I
am
,
it
is
certainly
true
,
the
conscientious
opponent
of
your
being
relieved
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
it
my
duty
to
be
so
;
it
is
a
most
unfortunate
necessity
;
and
cost
me
a
bitter
struggle
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
Will
you
try
this
box

<EOS>
If
you
do
n't
object
to
a
trifling
infusion
of
a
very
chaste
scent
,
you
'll
find
its
flavour
exquisite
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ask
your
pardon
,
Sir
John
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
declining
the
proffer
with
a
motion
of
his
hand
,
"
for
having
ranked
you
among
the
humble
instruments
who
are
obvious
and
in
all
men
's
sight
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
done
more
justice
to
your
genius
.
 
<EOS>
Men
of
your
capacity
plot
in
secrecy
and
safety
,
and
leave
exposed
posts
to
the
duller
wits

<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
apologise
,
for
the
world
,
"
replied
Sir
John
sweetly
;
"
old
friends
like
you
and
I
,
may
be
allowed
some
freedoms
,
or
the
deuce
is
in
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gashford
,
who
had
been
very
restless
all
this
time
,
but
had
not
once
looked
up
,
now
turned
to
Sir
John
,
and
ventured
to
mutter
something
to
the
effect
that
he
must
go
,
or
my
lord
would
perhaps
be
waiting
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
distress
yourself
,
good
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
"
I
'll
take
my
leave
,
and
put
you
at
your
ease
---
"
<EOS>
which
he
was
about
to
do
without
ceremony
,
when
he
was
stayed
by
a
buzz
and
murmur
at
the
upper
end
of
the
hall
,
and
,
looking
in
that
direction
,
saw
Lord
George
Gordon
coming
in
,
with
a
crowd
of
people
round
him
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
lurking
look
of
triumph
,
though
very
differently
expressed
,
in
the
faces
of
his
two
companions
,
which
made
it
a
natural
impulse
on
Mr
Haredale
's
part
not
to
give
way
before
this
leader
,
but
to
stand
there
while
he
passed
.
 
<EOS>
He
drew
himself
up
and
,
clasping
his
hands
behind
him
,
looked
on
with
a
proud
and
scornful
aspect
,
while
Lord
George
slowly
advanced
(
for
the
press
was
great
about
him
)
towards
the
spot
where
they
were
standing
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
left
the
House
of
Commons
but
that
moment
,
and
had
come
straight
down
into
the
Hall
,
bringing
with
him
,
as
his
custom
was
,
intelligence
of
what
had
been
said
that
night
in
reference
to
the
Papists
,
and
what
petitions
had
been
presented
in
their
favour
,
and
who
had
supported
them
,
and
when
the
bill
was
to
be
brought
in
,
and
when
it
would
be
advisable
to
present
their
own
Great
Protestant
petition
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
he
told
the
persons
about
him
in
a
loud
voice
,
and
with
great
abundance
of
ungainly
gesture
.
 
<EOS>
Those
who
were
nearest
him
made
comments
to
each
other
,
and
vented
threats
and
murmurings
;
those
who
were
outside
the
crowd
cried
,
"
Silence
,
"
and
Stand
back
,
"
or
closed
in
upon
the
rest
,
endeavouring
to
make
a
forcible
exchange
of
places
:
<EOS>
and
so
they
came
driving
on
in
a
very
disorderly
and
irregular
way
,
as
it
is
the
manner
of
a
crowd
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
When
they
were
very
near
to
where
the
secretary
,
Sir
John
,
and
Mr
Haredale
stood
,
Lord
George
turned
round
and
,
making
a
few
remarks
of
a
sufficiently
violent
and
incoherent
kind
,
concluded
with
the
usual
sentiment
,
and
called
for
three
cheers
to
back
it
.
 
<EOS>
While
these
were
in
the
act
of
being
given
with
great
energy
,
he
extricated
himself
from
the
press
,
and
stepped
up
to
Gashford
's
side
.
 
<EOS>
Both
he
and
Sir
John
being
well
known
to
the
populace
,
they
fell
back
a
little
,
and
left
the
four
standing
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Haredale
,
Lord
George
,
"
said
Sir
John
Chester
,
seeing
that
the
nobleman
regarded
him
with
an
inquisitive
look
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
Catholic
gentleman
unfortunately
---
most
unhappily
a
Catholic
---
but
an
esteemed
acquaintance
of
mine
,
and
once
of
Mr
Gashford
's
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
Haredale
,
this
is
Lord
George
Gordon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
known
that
,
had
I
been
ignorant
of
his
lordship
's
person
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
there
is
but
one
gentleman
in
England
who
,
addressing
an
ignorant
and
excited
throng
,
would
speak
of
a
large
body
of
his
fellow
-
subjects
in
such
injurious
language
as
I
heard
this
moment
.
 
<EOS>
For
shame
,
my
lord
,
for
shame
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
talk
to
you
,
sir
,
"
replied
Lord
George
in
a
loud
voice
,
and
waving
his
hand
in
a
disturbed
and
agitated
manner
;
"
we
have
nothing
in
common
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
much
in
common
---
many
things
---
all
that
the
Almighty
gave
us
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
;
"
and
common
charity
,
not
to
say
common
sense
and
common
decency
,
should
teach
you
to
refrain
from
these
proceedings
.
 
<EOS>
If
every
one
of
those
men
had
arms
in
their
hands
at
this
moment
,
as
they
have
them
in
their
heads
,
I
would
not
leave
this
place
without
telling
you
that
you
disgrace
your
station
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
hear
you
,
sir
,
"
he
replied
in
the
same
manner
as
before
;
"
I
ca
n't
hear
you
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
indifferent
to
me
what
you
say
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
retort
,
Gashford
,
"
for
the
secretary
had
made
a
show
of
wishing
to
do
so
;
"
I
can
hold
no
communion
with
the
worshippers
of
idols
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
he
said
this
,
he
glanced
at
Sir
John
,
who
lifted
his
hands
and
eyebrows
,
as
if
deploring
the
intemperate
conduct
of
Mr
Haredale
,
and
smiled
in
admiration
of
the
crowd
and
of
their
leader
.
  
<EOS>
"
HE
retort
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Haredale
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
you
here
,
my
lord
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
this
man
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
George
replied
by
laying
his
hand
upon
the
shoulder
of
his
cringing
secretary
,
and
viewing
him
with
a
smile
of
confidence
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
man
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
eyeing
him
from
top
to
toe
,
"
who
in
his
boyhood
was
a
thief
,
and
has
been
from
that
time
to
this
,
a
servile
,
false
,
and
truckling
knave
:
<EOS>
this
man
,
who
has
crawled
and
crept
through
life
,
wounding
the
hands
he
licked
,
and
biting
those
he
fawned
upon
:
this
sycophant
,
who
never
knew
what
honour
,
truth
,
or
courage
meant
;
who
robbed
his
benefactor
's
daughter
of
her
virtue
,
and
married
her
to
break
her
heart
,
and
did
it
,
with
stripes
and
cruelty
:
this
creature
,
who
has
whined
at
kitchen
windows
for
the
broken
food
,
and
begged
for
halfpence
at
our
chapel
doors
:
this
apostle
of
the
faith
,
whose
tender
conscience
can
not
bear
the
altars
where
his
vicious
life
was
publicly
denounced
---
<EOS>
Do
you
know
this
man
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
really
---
you
are
very
,
very
hard
upon
our
friend
!
"
exclaimed
Sir
John
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
Mr
Haredale
go
on
,
"
said
Gashford
,
upon
whose
unwholesome
face
the
perspiration
had
broken
out
during
this
speech
,
in
blotches
of
wet
;
"
I
do
n't
mind
him
,
Sir
John
;
it
's
quite
as
indifferent
to
me
what
he
says
,
as
it
is
to
my
lord
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
reviles
my
lord
,
as
you
have
heard
,
Sir
John
,
how
can
I
hope
to
escape
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
not
enough
,
my
lord
,
"
Mr
Haredale
continued
,
"
that
I
,
as
good
a
gentleman
as
you
,
must
hold
my
property
,
such
as
it
is
,
by
a
trick
at
which
the
state
connives
because
of
these
hard
laws
;
and
that
we
may
not
teach
our
youth
in
schools
the
common
principles
of
right
and
wrong
;
but
must
we
be
denounced
and
ridden
by
such
men
as
this
!
 
<EOS>
Here
is
a
man
to
head
your
No
-
Popery
cry
!
 
<EOS>
For
shame
.
 
<EOS>
For
shame
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
infatuated
nobleman
had
glanced
more
than
once
at
Sir
John
Chester
,
as
if
to
inquire
whether
there
was
any
truth
in
these
statements
concerning
Gashford
,
and
Sir
John
had
as
often
plainly
answered
by
a
shrug
or
look
,
"
<EOS>
Oh
dear
me
!
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
now
said
,
in
the
same
loud
key
,
and
in
the
same
strange
manner
as
before
:
  
"
I
have
nothing
to
say
,
sir
,
in
reply
,
and
no
desire
to
hear
anything
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
you
wo
n't
obtrude
your
conversation
,
or
these
personal
attacks
,
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
not
be
deterred
from
doing
my
duty
to
my
country
and
my
countrymen
,
by
any
such
attempts
,
whether
they
proceed
from
emissaries
of
the
Pope
or
not
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
Come
,
Gashford
!
"
  
<EOS>
They
had
walked
on
a
few
paces
while
speaking
,
and
were
now
at
the
Hall
-
door
,
through
which
they
passed
together
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
,
without
any
leave
-
taking
,
turned
away
to
the
river
stairs
,
which
were
close
at
hand
,
and
hailed
the
only
boatman
who
remained
there
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
throng
of
people
---
the
foremost
of
whom
had
heard
every
word
that
Lord
George
Gordon
said
,
and
among
all
of
whom
the
rumour
had
been
rapidly
dispersed
that
the
stranger
was
a
Papist
who
was
bearding
him
for
his
advocacy
of
the
popular
cause
---
came
pouring
out
pell
-
mell
,
and
,
forcing
the
nobleman
,
his
secretary
,
and
Sir
John
Chester
on
before
them
,
so
that
they
appeared
to
be
at
their
head
,
crowded
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
where
Mr
Haredale
waited
until
the
boat
was
ready
,
and
there
stood
still
,
leaving
him
on
a
little
clear
space
by
himself
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
not
silent
,
however
,
though
inactive
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
some
indistinct
mutterings
arose
among
them
,
which
were
followed
by
a
hiss
or
two
,
and
these
swelled
by
degrees
into
a
perfect
storm
.
<EOS>
Then
one
voice
said
,
"
Down
with
the
Papists
!
"
<EOS>
and
there
was
a
pretty
general
cheer
,
but
nothing
more
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
lull
of
a
few
moments
,
one
man
cried
out
,
"
Stone
him
;
"
another
,
"
Duck
him
;
"
<EOS>
another
,
in
a
stentorian
voice
,
"
No
Popery
!
"
 
<EOS>
This
favourite
cry
the
rest
re
-
echoed
,
and
the
mob
,
which
might
have
been
two
hundred
strong
,
joined
in
a
general
shout
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
had
stood
calmly
on
the
brink
of
the
steps
,
until
they
made
this
demonstration
,
when
he
looked
round
contemptuously
,
and
walked
at
a
slow
pace
down
the
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
pretty
near
the
boat
,
when
Gashford
,
as
if
without
intention
,
turned
about
,
and
directly
afterwards
a
great
stone
was
thrown
by
some
hand
,
in
the
crowd
,
which
struck
him
on
the
head
,
and
made
him
stagger
like
a
drunken
man
.
  
<EOS>
The
blood
sprung
freely
from
the
wound
,
and
trickled
down
his
coat
.
<EOS>
He
turned
directly
,
and
rushing
up
the
steps
with
a
boldness
and
passion
which
made
them
all
fall
back
,
demanded
:
  
"
Who
did
that
?
 
<EOS>
Show
me
the
man
who
hit
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Not
a
soul
moved
;
except
some
in
the
rear
who
slunk
off
,
and
,
escaping
to
the
other
side
of
the
way
,
looked
on
like
indifferent
spectators
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
did
that
?
"
he
repeated
.
 
<EOS>
"
Show
me
the
man
who
did
it
.
 
<EOS>
Dog
,
was
it
you
?
 
<EOS>
It
was
your
deed
,
if
not
<EOS>
your
hand
---
I
know
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
threw
himself
on
Gashford
as
he
said
the
words
,
and
hurled
him
to
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
sudden
motion
in
the
crowd
,
and
some
laid
hands
upon
him
,
but
his
sword
was
out
,
and
they
fell
off
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
lord
---
Sir
John
,
"
---
he
cried
,
"
draw
,
one
of
you
---
you
are
responsible
for
this
outrage
,
and
I
look
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Draw
,
if
you
are
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
that
he
struck
Sir
John
upon
the
breast
with
the
flat
of
his
weapon
,
and
with
a
burning
face
and
flashing
eyes
stood
upon
his
guard
;
alone
,
before
them
all
.
  
<EOS>
For
an
instant
,
for
the
briefest
space
of
time
the
mind
can
readily
conceive
,
there
was
a
change
in
Sir
John
's
smooth
face
,
such
as
no
man
ever
saw
there
.
 
<EOS>
The
next
moment
,
he
stepped
forward
,
and
laid
one
hand
on
Mr
Haredale
's
arm
,
while
with
the
other
he
endeavoured
to
appease
the
crowd
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
friend
,
my
good
Haredale
,
you
are
blinded
with
passion
---
 
it
's
very
natural
,
extremely
natural
---
but
you
do
n't
know
friends
from
foes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
them
all
,
sir
,
I
can
distinguish
well
<EOS>
---
"
he
retorted
,
almost
mad
with
rage
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
John
,
Lord
George
---
do
you
hear
me
?
 
<EOS>
Are
you
cowards
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
,
sir
,
"
said
a
man
,
forcing
his
way
between
and
pushing
him
towards
the
stairs
with
friendly
violence
,
"
never
mind
asking
that
.
 
<EOS>
For
God
's
sake
,
get
away
.
 
<EOS>
What
CAN
you
do
against
this
number
?
 
<EOS>
And
there
are
as
many
more
in
the
next
street
,
who
'll
be
round
directly
,
"
---
<EOS>
indeed
they
began
to
pour
in
as
he
said
the
words
---
"
you
'd
be
giddy
from
that
cut
,
in
the
first
heat
of
a
scuffle
.
 
<EOS>
Now
do
retire
,
sir
,
or
take
my
word
for
it
<EOS>
you
'll
be
worse
used
than
you
would
be
if
every
man
in
the
crowd
was
a
woman
,
and
that
woman
Bloody
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
sir
,
make
haste
---
as
quick
as
you
can
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
,
who
began
to
turn
faint
and
sick
,
felt
how
sensible
this
advice
was
,
and
descended
the
steps
with
his
unknown
friend
's
assistance
.
 
<EOS>
John
Grueby
(
for
John
it
was
)
helped
him
into
the
boat
,
and
giving
her
a
shove
off
,
which
sent
her
thirty
feet
into
the
tide
,
bade
the
waterman
pull
away
like
a
Briton
;
and
walked
up
again
as
composedly
as
if
he
had
just
landed
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
at
first
a
slight
disposition
on
the
part
of
the
mob
to
resent
this
interference
;
but
John
looking
particularly
strong
and
cool
,
and
wearing
besides
Lord
George
's
livery
<EOS>
,
they
thought
better
of
it
,
and
contented
themselves
with
sending
a
shower
of
small
missiles
after
the
boat
,
which
plashed
harmlessly
in
the
water
;
for
she
had
by
this
time
cleared
the
bridge
,
and
was
darting
swiftly
down
the
centre
of
the
stream
.
  
<EOS>
From
this
amusement
,
they
proceeded
to
giving
Protestant
knocks
at
the
doors
of
private
houses
,
breaking
a
few
lamps
,
and
assaulting
some
stray
constables
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
it
being
whispered
that
a
detachment
of
Life
Guards
had
been
sent
for
,
they
took
to
their
heels
with
great
expedition
,
and
left
the
street
quite
clear
.

Chapter

<EOS>
When
the
concourse
separated
,
and
,
dividing
into
chance
clusters
,
drew
off
in
various
directions
,
there
still
remained
upon
the
scene
of
the
late
disturbance
,
one
man
.
 
<EOS>
This
man
was
Gashford
,
who
,
bruised
by
his
late
fall
,
and
hurt
in
a
much
greater
degree
by
the
indignity
he
had
undergone
,
and
the
exposure
of
which
he
had
been
the
victim
,
limped
up
and
down
,
breathing
curses
and
threats
of
vengeance
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
the
secretary
's
nature
to
waste
his
wrath
in
words
.
<EOS>
While
he
vented
the
froth
of
his
malevolence
in
those
effusions
,
he
kept
a
steady
eye
on
two
men
,
who
,
having
disappeared
with
the
rest
when
the
alarm
was
spread
,
had
since
returned
,
and
were
now
visible
in
the
moonlight
,
at
no
great
distance
,
as
they
walked
to
and
fro
,
and
talked
together
.
  
<EOS>
He
made
no
move
towards
them
,
but
waited
patiently
on
the
dark
side
of
the
street
,
until
they
were
tired
of
strolling
backwards
and
forwards
and
walked
away
in
company
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
followed
,
but
at
some
distance
:
keeping
them
in
view
,
without
appearing
to
have
that
object
,
or
being
seen
by
them
.
  
<EOS>
They
went
up
Parliament
Street
,
past
Saint
Martin
's
church
,
and
away
by
Saint
Giles
's
to
Tottenham
Court
Road
,
at
the
back
of
which
,
upon
the
western
side
,
was
then
a
place
called
the
Green
Lanes
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
a
retired
spot
,
not
of
the
choicest
kind
,
leading
into
the
fields
.
 
<EOS>
Great
heaps
of
ashes
;
stagnant
pools
,
overgrown
with
rank
grass
and
duckweed
;
broken
turnstiles
;
and
the
upright
posts
of
palings
long
since
carried
off
for
firewood
,
which
menaced
all
heedless
walkers
with
their
jagged
and
rusty
nails
;
were
the
leading
features
of
the
landscape
:
while
here
and
there
a
donkey
,
or
a
ragged
horse
,
tethered
to
a
stake
,
and
cropping
off
a
wretched
meal
from
the
coarse
stunted
turf
,
were
quite
in
keeping
with
the
scene
,
and
would
have
suggested
(
if
the
houses
had
not
done
so
,
sufficiently
,
of
themselves
)
<EOS>
how
very
poor
the
people
were
who
lived
in
the
crazy
huts
adjacent
,
and
how
foolhardy
it
might
prove
for
one
who
carried
money
,
or
wore
decent
clothes
,
to
walk
that
way
alone
,
unless
by
daylight
.
  
<EOS>
Poverty
has
its
whims
and
shows
of
taste
,
as
wealth
has
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
these
cabins
were
turreted
,
some
had
false
windows
painted
on
their
rotten
walls
;
one
had
a
mimic
clock
,
upon
a
crazy
tower
of
four
feet
high
,
which
screened
the
chimney
;
each
in
its
little
patch
of
ground
had
a
rude
seat
or
arbour
.
 
<EOS>
The
population
dealt
in
bones
,
in
rags
,
in
broken
glass
,
in
old
wheels
,
in
birds
,
and
dogs
.
<EOS>
These
,
in
their
several
ways
of
stowage
,
filled
the
gardens
;
and
shedding
a
perfume
,
not
of
the
most
delicious
nature
,
in
the
air
,
filled
it
besides
with
yelps
,
and
screams
,
and
howling
.
  
<EOS>
Into
this
retreat
,
the
secretary
followed
the
two
men
whom
he
had
held
in
sight
;
and
here
he
saw
them
safely
lodged
,
in
one
of
the
meanest
houses
,
which
was
but
a
room
,
and
that
of
small
dimensions
.
<EOS>
He
waited
without
,
until
the
sound
of
their
voices
,
joined
in
a
discordant
song
,
assured
him
they
were
making
merry
;
and
then
approaching
the
door
,
by
means
of
a
tottering
plank
which
crossed
the
ditch
in
front
,
knocked
at
it
with
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Muster
Gashfordl
"
said
the
man
who
opened
it
,
taking
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
,
in
evident
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
who
'd
have
thought
of
this
here
honour
!
 
<EOS>
Walk
in
,
Muster
Gashford
---
walk
in
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Gashford
required
no
second
invitation
,
and
entered
with
a
gracious
air
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
fire
in
the
rusty
grate
(
for
though
the
spring
was
pretty
far
advanced
,
the
nights
were
cold
)
,
and
on
a
stool
beside
it
<EOS>
Hugh
sat
smoking
.
 
<EOS>
Dennis
placed
a
chair
,
his
only
one
,
for
the
secretary
,
in
front
of
the
hearth
;
and
took
his
seat
again
upon
the
stool
he
had
left
when
he
rose
to
give
the
visitor
admission
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
in
the
wind
now
,
Muster
Gashford
?
<EOS>
"
he
said
,
as
he
resumed
his
pipe
,
and
looked
at
him
askew
.
 
<EOS>
"
Any
orders
from
head
-
quarters
?
<EOS>
Are
we
going
to
begin
?
 
<EOS>
What
is
it
,
Muster
Gashford
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
nothing
,
nothing
,
"
rejoined
the
secretary
,
with
a
friendly
nod
to
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
broken
the
ice
,
though
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
a
little
spurt
to
-
day
---
eh
,
Dennis
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
very
little
one
,
"
growled
the
hangman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
half
enough
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
me
neither
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Give
us
something
to
do
with
life
in
it
---
with
life
in
it
,
master
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
!
"
  
"
Why
,
you
would
n't
,
"
said
the
secretary
,
with
his
worst
expression
of
face
,
and
in
his
mildest
tones
,
"
have
anything
to
do
,
with
---
with
death
in
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
,
"
replied
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
open
to
orders
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
care
;
not
I.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Nor
I
!
"
<EOS>
vociferated
Dennis
.
  
<EOS>
"
Brave
fellows
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
secretary
,
in
as
pastor
-
like
a
voice
as
if
he
were
commending
them
for
some
uncommon
act
of
valour
and
generosity
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
the
bye
"
---
and
here
he
stopped
and
warmed
his
hands
:
then
suddenly
looked
up
---
"
who
threw
that
stone
to
-
day
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dennis
coughed
and
shook
his
head
,
as
who
should
say
,
"
A
mystery
indeed
!
"
 
<EOS>
Hugh
sat
and
smoked
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
well
done
!
"
said
the
secretary
,
warming
his
hands
again
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
know
that
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Would
you
?
"
said
Dennis
,
after
looking
at
his
face
to
assure
himself
that
he
was
serious
.
 
<EOS>
"
Would
you
like
to
know
that
man
,
Muster
Gashford
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
indeed
,
"
replied
the
secretary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
then
,
Lord
love
you
,
"
said
the
hangman
,
in
his
hoarest
chuckle
,
as
he
pointed
with
his
pipe
to
Hugh
,
"
there
he
sits
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
My
stars
and
halters
,
Muster
Gashford
,
"
he
added
in
a
whisper
,
as
he
drew
his
stool
close
to
him
and
jogged
him
with
his
elbow
,
"
what
a
interesting
blade
he
is
!
 
<EOS>
He
wants
as
much
holding
in
as
a
thorough
-
bred
bulldog
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
had
n't
been
for
me
to
-
day
,
he
'd
have
had
that
'
ere
Roman
down
,
and
made
a
riot
of
it
,
in
another
minute
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
why
not
?
"
cried
Hugh
in
a
surly
voice
,
as
he
overheard
this
last
remark
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
's
the
good
of
putting
things
off
?
 
<EOS>
Strike
<EOS>
while
the
iron
's
hot
;
that
's
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ah
!
"
retorted
Dennis
,
shaking
his
head
,
with
a
kind
of
pity
for
his
friend
's
ingenuous
youth
;
"
but
suppose
the
iron
an't
hot
,
brother
!
 
<EOS>
You
must
get
people
's
blood
up
afore
<EOS>
you
strike
,
and
have
'em
in
the
humour
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
n't
quite
enough
to
provoke
'em
to
-
day
,
I
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
'd
had
your
way
,
you
'd
have
spoilt
the
fun
to
come
,
and
ruined
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dennis
is
quite
right
,
"
said
Gashford
,
smoothly
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
perfectly
correct
.
 
<EOS>
Dennis
has
great
knowledge
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ought
to
have
,
Muster
Gashford
,
seeing
what
a
many
people
I
've
helped
out
of
it
,
eh
?
"
grinned
the
hangman
,
whispering
the
words
behind
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
The
secretary
laughed
at
this
jest
as
much
as
Dennis
could
desire
,
and
when
he
had
done
,
said
,
turning
to
Hugh
:
  
<EOS>
"
Dennis
's
policy
was
mine
,
as
you
may
have
observed
.
 
<EOS>
You
saw
,
for
instance
<EOS>
,
how
I
fell
when
I
was
set
upon
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
no
resistance
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
nothing
to
provoke
an
outbreak
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
dear
no
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
by
the
Lord
Harry
!
"
cried
Dennis
with
a
noisy
laugh
,
"
you
went
down
very
quiet
,
Muster
Gashford
---
and
very
flat
besides
.
 
<EOS>
I
thinks
to
myself
at
the
time
<EOS>
"
it
's
all
up
with
Muster
Gashford
!
"
 
<EOS>
I
never
see
a
man
lay
flatter
nor
more
still
---
with
the
life
in
him
---
than
you
did
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
a
rough
'
un
to
play
with
<EOS>
,
is
that
'
ere
Papist
,
and
that
's
the
fact
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
secretary
's
face
,
as
Dennis
roared
with
laughter
,
and
turned
his
wrinkled
eyes
on
Hugh
who
did
the
like
,
might
have
furnished
a
study
for
the
devil
's
picture
.
 
<EOS>
He
sat
quite
silent
until
they
were
serious
again
,
and
then
said
,
looking
round
:
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
very
pleasant
here
;
so
very
pleasant
,
Dennis
,
that
but
for
my
lord
's
particular
desire
that
I
should
sup
with
him
,
and
the
time
being
very
near
at
hand
,
I
should
he
inclined
to
stay
,
until
it
would
be
hardly
safe
to
go
homeward
.
 
<EOS>
I
come
upon
a
little
business
---
<EOS>
yes
,
I
do
---
as
you
supposed
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
very
flattering
to
you
;
being
this
.
 
<EOS>
If
we
ever
should
be
obliged
---
and
we
ca
n't
tell
,
you
know
---
this
is
a
very
uncertain
world
"
---
   
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
,
Muster
Gashford
,
"
interposed
the
hangman
with
a
grave
nod
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
uncertainties
as
I
've
seen
in
reference
to
this
here
state
of
existence
,
the
unexpected
contingencies
as
have
come
about
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Oh
my
eye
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Feeling
the
subject
much
too
vast
for
expression
,
he
puffed
at
his
pipe
again
,
and
looked
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
resumed
the
secretary
,
in
a
slow
,
impressive
way
;
"
we
ca
n't
tell
what
may
come
to
pass
;
and
if
we
should
be
obliged
,
against
our
wills
,
to
have
recourse
to
violence
,
my
lord
(
who
has
suffered
terribly
to
-
day
,
as
far
as
words
can
go
)
consigns
to
you
two
---
<EOS>
bearing
in
mind
my
recommendation
of
you
both
,
as
good
staunch
men
,
beyond
all
doubt
and
suspicion
---
<EOS>
the
pleasant
task
of
punishing
this
Haredale
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
do
as
you
please
with
him
,
or
his
,
provided
that
you
show
no
mercy
,
and
no
quarter
,
and
leave
no
two
beams
of
his
house
standing
where
the
builder
placed
them
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
sack
it
,
burn
it
,
do
with
it
as
you
like
,
but
it
must
come
down
;
it
must
be
razed
to
the
ground
;
and
he
,
and
all
belonging
to
him
,
left
as
shelterless
as
new
-
born
infants
whom
their
mothers
have
exposed
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
understand
me
?
"
said
Gashford
,
pausing
,
and
pressing
his
hands
together
gently
.
  
<EOS>
"
Understand
you
,
master
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
speak
plain
now
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
this
is
hearty
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
knew
you
would
like
it
,
"
said
Gashford
,
shaking
him
by
the
hand
;
"
I
thought
you
would
.
 
<EOS>
Good
night
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
rise
,
Dennis
:
I
would
rather
find
my
way
alone
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
have
to
make
other
visits
here
,
and
it
's
pleasant
to
come
and
go
without
disturbing
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
find
my
way
perfectly
well
.
 
<EOS>
Good
night
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
gone
,
and
had
shut
the
door
behind
him
.
 
<EOS>
They
looked
at
each
other
,
and
nodded
approvingly
:
Dennis
stirred
up
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
looks
a
little
more
like
business
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
indeed
!
"
cried
Hugh
;
"
this
suits
me
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
heerd
it
said
of
Muster
Gashford
,
"
said
the
hangman
,
"
that
he
'd
a
surprising
memory
and
wonderful
firmness
---
that
he
never
forgot
,
and
never
forgave
.
<EOS>
---
Let
's
drink
his
health
!
"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
readily
complied
---
pouring
no
liquor
on
the
floor
when
he
drank
this
toast
---
and
they
pledged
the
secretary
as
a
man
after
their
own
hearts
,
in
a
bumper
.

Chapter
45
    
<EOS>
While
the
worst
passions
of
the
worst
men
were
thus
working
in
the
dark
,
and
the
mantle
of
religion
,
assumed
to
cover
the
ugliest
deformities
,
threatened
to
become
the
shroud
of
all
that
was
good
and
peaceful
in
society
,
a
circumstance
occurred
which
once
more
altered
the
position
of
two
persons
from
whom
this
history
has
long
been
separated
,
and
to
whom
it
must
now
return
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
small
English
country
town
,
the
inhabitants
of
which
supported
themselves
by
the
labour
of
their
hands
in
plaiting
and
preparing
straw
for
those
who
made
bonnets
and
other
articles
of
dress
and
ornament
from
that
material
,
---
concealed
under
an
assumed
name
,
and
living
in
a
quiet
poverty
which
knew
no
change
,
no
pleasures
,
and
few
cares
but
that
of
struggling
on
from
day
to
day
in
one
great
toil
for
bread
,
---
dwelt
Barnaby
and
his
mother
.
 
<EOS>
Their
poor
cottage
had
known
no
stranger
's
foot
since
they
sought
the
shelter
of
its
roof
five
years
before
;
nor
had
they
in
all
that
time
held
any
commerce
or
communication
with
the
old
world
from
which
they
had
fled
.
 
<EOS>
To
labour
in
peace
,
and
devote
her
labour
and
her
life
to
her
poor
son
,
was
all
the
widow
sought
.
 
<EOS>
If
happiness
can
be
said
at
any
time
to
be
the
lot
of
one
on
whom
a
secret
sorrow
preys
,
she
was
happy
now
.
 
<EOS>
Tranquillity
,
resignation
,
and
her
strong
love
of
him
who
needed
it
so
much
,
formed
the
small
circle
of
her
quiet
joys
;
and
while
that
remained
unbroken
,
she
was
contented
.
  
<EOS>
For
Barnaby
himself
,
the
time
which
had
flown
by
,
had
passed
him
like
the
wind
.
 
<EOS>
The
daily
suns
of
years
had
shed
no
brighter
gleam
of
reason
on
his
mind
;
no
dawn
had
broken
on
his
long
,
dark
night
.
<EOS>
He
would
sit
sometimes
---
often
for
days
together
on
a
low
seat
by
the
fire
or
by
the
cottage
door
,
busy
at
work
(
for
he
had
learnt
the
art
his
mother
plied
)
,
and
listening
,
God
help
him
,
to
the
tales
she
would
repeat
,
as
a
lure
to
keep
him
in
her
sight
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
no
recollection
of
these
little
narratives
;
the
tale
of
yesterday
was
new
to
him
upon
the
morrow
;
but
he
liked
them
at
the
moment
;
and
when
the
humour
held
him
,
would
remain
patiently
within
doors
,
hearing
her
stories
like
a
little
child
,
and
working
cheerfully
from
sunrise
until
it
was
too
dark
to
see
.
  
<EOS>
At
other
times
,
---
and
then
their
scanty
earnings
were
barely
sufficient
to
furnish
them
with
food
,
though
of
the
coarsest
sort
,
---
 
he
would
wander
abroad
from
dawn
of
day
until
the
twilight
deepened
into
night
.
 
<EOS>
Few
in
that
place
,
even
of
the
children
,
could
be
idle
,
and
he
had
no
companions
of
his
own
kind
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
there
were
not
many
who
could
have
kept
up
with
him
in
his
rambles
,
<EOS>
had
there
been
a
legion
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
were
a
score
of
vagabond
dogs
belonging
to
the
neighbours
,
who
served
his
purpose
quite
as
well
.
<EOS>
With
two
or
three
of
these
,
or
sometimes
with
a
full
half
-
dozen
barking
at
his
heels
,
he
would
sally
forth
on
some
long
expedition
that
consumed
the
day
;
and
though
,
on
their
return
at
nightfall
,
the
dogs
would
come
home
limping
and
sore
-
footed
,
and
almost
spent
with
their
fatigue
,
Barnaby
was
up
and
off
again
at
sunrise
with
some
new
attendants
of
the
same
class
,
with
whom
he
would
return
in
like
manner
.
 
<EOS>
On
all
these
travels
,
Grip
,
in
his
little
basket
at
his
master
's
back
,
was
a
constant
member
of
the
party
,
and
when
they
set
off
in
fine
weather
and
in
high
spirits
,
no
dog
barked
louder
than
the
raven
.
  
<EOS>
Their
pleasures
on
these
excursions
were
simple
enough
.
 
<EOS>
A
crust
of
bread
and
scrap
of
meat
,
with
water
from
the
brook
or
spring
,
sufficed
for
their
repast
.
 
<EOS>
Barnaby
's
enjoyments
were
,
to
walk
,
and
run
,
and
leap
,
till
he
was
tired
;
then
to
lie
down
in
the
long
grass
,
or
by
the
growing
corn
,
or
in
the
shade
of
some
tall
tree
,
looking
upward
at
the
light
clouds
as
they
floated
over
the
blue
surface
of
the
sky
,
and
listening
to
the
lark
as
she
poured
out
her
brilliant
song
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
wild
-
flowers
to
pluck
---
the
bright
red
poppy
,
the
gentle
harebell
,
the
cowslip
,
and
the
rose
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
birds
to
watch
;
fish
;
ants
;
worms
;
hares
or
rabbits
,
as
they
darted
across
the
distant
pathway
in
the
wood
and
so
were
gone
:
<EOS>
millions
of
living
things
to
have
an
interest
in
,
and
lie
in
wait
for
,
and
clap
hands
and
shout
in
memory
of
,
when
they
had
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
In
default
of
these
,
or
when
they
wearied
,
there
was
the
merry
sunlight
to
hunt
out
,
as
it
crept
in
aslant
through
leaves
and
boughs
of
trees
,
and
hid
far
down
---
deep
,
deep
,
in
hollow
places
---
 
like
a
silver
pool
,
where
nodding
branches
seemed
to
bathe
and
sport
;
sweet
scents
of
summer
air
breathing
over
fields
of
beans
or
clover
;
the
perfume
of
wet
leaves
or
moss
;
the
life
of
waving
trees
,
and
shadows
always
changing
.
 
<EOS>
When
these
or
any
of
them
tired
,
or
in
excess
of
pleasing
tempted
him
to
shut
his
eyes
,
there
was
slumber
in
the
midst
of
all
these
soft
delights
,
with
the
gentle
wind
murmuring
like
music
in
his
ears
,
and
everything
around
melting
into
one
delicious
dream
.
  
<EOS>
Their
hut
---
for
it
was
little
more
---
stood
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
,
at
a
short
distance
from
the
high
road
,
but
in
a
secluded
place
,
where
few
chance
passengers
strayed
at
any
season
of
the
year
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
a
plot
of
garden
-
ground
attached
,
which
Barnaby
,
in
fits
and
starts
of
working
,
trimmed
,
and
kept
in
order
.
 
<EOS>
Within
doors
and
without
,
his
mother
laboured
for
their
common
good
;
and
hail
,
rain
,
snow
,
or
sunshine
,
found
no
difference
in
her
.
  
<EOS>
Though
so
far
removed
from
the
scenes
of
her
past
life
,
and
with
so
little
thought
or
hope
of
ever
visiting
them
again
,
she
seemed
to
have
a
strange
desire
to
know
what
happened
in
the
busy
world
.
 
<EOS>
Any
old
newspaper
,
or
scrap
of
intelligence
from
London
,
she
caught
at
with
avidity
.
 
<EOS>
The
excitement
it
produced
was
not
of
a
pleasurable
kind
,
for
her
manner
at
such
times
expressed
the
keenest
anxiety
and
dread
;
but
it
never
faded
in
the
least
degree
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
and
in
stormy
winter
nights
,
when
the
wind
blew
loud
and
strong
,
the
old
expression
came
into
her
face
,
and
she
would
be
seized
with
a
fit
of
trembling
,
like
one
who
had
an
ague
.
 
<EOS>
But
Barnaby
noted
little
of
this
;
and
putting
a
great
constraint
upon
herself
,
she
usually
recovered
her
accustomed
manner
before
the
change
had
caught
his
observation
.
  
<EOS>
Grip
was
by
no
means
an
idle
or
unprofitable
member
of
the
humble
household
.
 
<EOS>
Partly
by
dint
of
Barnaby
's
tuition
,
and
partly
by
pursuing
a
species
of
self
-
instruction
common
to
his
tribe
,
and
exerting
his
powers
of
observation
to
the
utmost
,
he
had
acquired
a
degree
of
sagacity
which
rendered
him
famous
for
miles
round
.
 
<EOS>
His
conversational
powers
and
surprising
performances
were
the
universal
theme
:
and
as
many
persons
came
to
see
the
wonderful
raven
,
and
none
left
his
exertions
unrewarded
---
when
he
condescended
to
exhibit
,
which
was
not
always
,
for
genius
is
capricious
---
his
earnings
formed
an
important
item
in
the
common
stock
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
bird
himself
appeared
to
know
his
value
well
;
for
though
he
was
perfectly
free
and
unrestrained
in
the
presence
of
Barnaby
and
his
mother
,
he
maintained
in
public
an
amazing
gravity
,
and
never
stooped
to
any
other
gratuitous
performances
than
biting
the
ankles
of
vagabond
boys
(
an
exercise
in
which
he
much
delighted
)
,
killing
a
fowl
or
two
occasionally
,
and
swallowing
the
dinners
of
various
neighbouring
dogs
,
of
whom
the
boldest
held
him
in
great
awe
and
dread
.
  
<EOS>
Time
had
glided
on
in
this
way
,
and
nothing
had
happened
to
disturb
or
change
their
mode
of
life
,
when
,
one
summer
's
night
in
June
,
they
were
in
their
little
garden
,
resting
from
the
labours
of
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
The
widow
's
work
was
yet
upon
her
knee
,
and
strewn
upon
the
ground
about
her
;
and
Barnaby
stood
leaning
on
his
spade
,
gazing
at
the
brightness
in
the
west
,
and
singing
softly
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
brave
evening
,
mother
!
 
<EOS>
If
we
had
,
chinking
in
our
pockets
,
but
a
few
specks
of
that
gold
which
is
piled
up
yonder
in
the
sky
,
we
should
be
rich
for
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
better
as
we
are
,
"
returned
the
widow
with
a
quiet
smile
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
be
contented
,
and
we
do
not
want
and
need
not
care
to
have
it
,
though
it
lay
shining
at
our
feet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
"
said
Barnaby
,
resting
with
crossed
arms
on
his
spade
,
and
looking
wistfully
at
the
sunset
<EOS>
,
that
's
well
enough
,
mother
;
but
gold
's
a
good
thing
to
have
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
that
I
knew
where
to
find
it
.
<EOS>
Grip
and
I
could
do
much
with
gold
,
be
sure
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
would
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
 
<EOS>
A
world
of
things
.
 
<EOS>
We
'd
dress
finely
---
you
and
I
,
I
mean
;
not
Grip
---
<EOS>
keep
horses
,
dogs
,
wear
bright
colours
and
feathers
,
do
no
more
work
,
live
delicately
and
at
our
ease
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
we
'd
find
uses
for
it
,
mother
,
and
uses
that
would
do
us
good
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
I
knew
where
gold
was
buried
.
 
<EOS>
How
hard
I
'd
work
to
dig
it
up
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
know
,
"
said
his
mother
,
rising
from
her
seat
and
laying
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
,
"
what
men
have
done
to
win
it
,
and
how
they
have
found
,
too
late
,
that
it
glitters
brightest
at
a
distance
,
and
turns
quite
dim
and
dull
when
handled
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
;
so
you
say
;
so
you
think
,
"
he
answered
,
still
looking
eagerly
in
the
same
direction
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
all
that
,
mother
,
I
should
like
to
try
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
not
see
,
"
she
said
,
"
how
red
it
is
?
 
<EOS>
Nothing
bears
so
many
stains
of
blood
,
as
gold
.
 
<EOS>
Avoid
it
.
 
<EOS>
None
have
such
cause
to
hate
its
name
as
we
have
.
 
<EOS>
Do
not
so
much
as
think
of
it
,
dear
love
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
brought
such
misery
and
suffering
on
your
head
and
mine
as
few
have
known
,
and
God
grant
<EOS>
few
may
have
to
undergo
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
rather
we
were
dead
and
laid
down
in
our
graves
,
than
you
should
ever
come
to
love
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
For
a
moment
Barnaby
withdrew
his
eyes
and
looked
at
her
with
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
glancing
from
the
redness
in
the
sky
to
the
mark
upon
his
wrist
as
if
he
would
compare
the
two
,
he
seemed
about
to
question
her
with
earnestness
,
when
a
new
object
caught
his
wandering
attention
,
and
made
him
quite
forgetful
of
his
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
a
man
with
dusty
feet
and
garments
,
who
stood
,
bare
-
headed
,
behind
the
hedge
that
divided
their
patch
of
garden
from
the
pathway
,
and
leant
meekly
forward
as
if
he
sought
to
mingle
with
their
conversation
,
and
waited
for
his
time
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
His
face
was
turned
towards
the
brightness
,
too
,
but
the
light
that
fell
upon
it
showed
that
he
was
blind
,
and
saw
it
not
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
blessing
on
those
voices
!
"
said
the
wayfarer
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
feel
the
beauty
of
the
night
more
keenly
,
when
I
hear
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
like
eyes
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Will
they
speak
again
,
and
cheer
the
heart
of
a
poor
traveller
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
no
guide
?
"
asked
the
widow
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
None
but
that
,
"
he
answered
,
pointing
with
his
staff
towards
the
sun
;
"
and
sometimes
a
milder
one
at
night
,
but
she
is
idle
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
travelled
far
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
weary
way
and
long
,
"
rejoined
the
traveller
as
he
shook
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
weary
,
weary
,
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
struck
my
stick
just
now
upon
the
bucket
of
your
well
---
be
pleased
to
let
me
have
a
draught
of
water
,
lady
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
call
me
lady
?
<EOS>
"
she
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
as
poor
as
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
speech
is
soft
and
gentle
,
and
I
judge
by
that
,
"
replied
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
coarsest
stuffs
and
finest
silks
,
are
---
apart
from
the
sense
of
touch
---
alike
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
judge
you
by
your
dress
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
round
this
way
,
"
said
Barnaby
,
who
had
passed
out
at
the
garden
-
gate
and
now
stood
close
beside
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Put
your
hand
in
mine
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
blind
and
always
in
the
dark
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
Are
you
frightened
in
the
dark
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
see
great
crowds
of
faces
,
now
?
 
<EOS>
Do
they
grin
and
chatter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
"
returned
the
other
,
"
I
see
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Waking
or
sleeping
,
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Barnaby
looked
curiously
at
his
eyes
,
and
touching
them
with
his
fingers
,
as
an
inquisitive
child
might
,
led
him
towards
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
come
a
long
distance
,
"
said
the
widow
,
meeting
him
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
have
you
found
your
way
so
far
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Use
and
necessity
are
good
teachers
,
as
I
have
heard
---
the
best
of
any
,
"
said
the
blind
man
,
sitting
down
upon
the
chair
to
which
Barnaby
had
led
him
,
and
putting
his
hat
and
stick
upon
the
red
-
tiled
floor
.
 
<EOS>
"
May
neither
you
nor
your
son
ever
learn
under
them
.
<EOS>
They
are
rough
masters
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
wandered
from
the
road
,
too
,
"
said
the
widow
,
in
a
tone
of
pity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Maybe
,
maybe
,
"
returned
the
blind
man
with
a
sigh
,
and
yet
with
something
of
a
smile
upon
his
face
,
"
that
's
likely
.
 
<EOS>
Handposts
and
milestones
are
dumb
,
indeed
,
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Thank
you
the
more
for
this
rest
,
and
this
refreshing
drink
!
"
  
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
he
raised
the
mug
of
water
to
his
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
clear
,
and
cold
,
and
sparkling
,
but
not
to
his
taste
nevertheless
,
or
his
thirst
was
not
very
great
,
for
he
only
wetted
his
lips
and
put
it
down
again
.
  
<EOS>
He
wore
,
hanging
with
a
long
strap
round
his
neck
,
a
kind
of
scrip
or
wallet
,
in
which
to
carry
food
.
 
<EOS>
The
widow
set
some
bread
and
cheese
before
him
,
but
he
thanked
her
,
and
said
that
through
the
kindness
of
the
charitable
he
had
broken
his
fast
once
since
morning
,
and
was
not
hungry
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
made
her
this
reply
,
he
opened
his
wallet
,
and
took
out
a
few
pence
,
which
was
all
it
appeared
to
contain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Might
I
make
bold
to
ask
,
"
he
said
,
turning
towards
where
Barnaby
stood
looking
on
,
"
that
one
who
has
the
gift
of
sight
,
would
lay
this
out
for
me
in
bread
to
keep
me
on
my
way
?
 
<EOS>
Heaven
's
blessing
on
the
young
feet
that
will
bestir
themselves
in
aid
of
one
so
helpless
as
a
sightless
man
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Barnaby
looked
at
his
mother
,
who
nodded
assent
;
in
another
moment
he
was
gone
upon
his
charitable
errand
.
 
<EOS>
The
blind
man
sat
listening
with
an
attentive
face
,
until
long
after
the
sound
of
his
retreating
footsteps
was
inaudible
to
the
widow
,
and
then
said
,
suddenly
,
and
in
a
very
altered
tone
:
  
<EOS>
"
There
are
various
degrees
and
kinds
of
blindness
,
widow
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
the
connubial
blindness
,
ma'am
,
which
perhaps
you
may
have
observed
in
the
course
of
your
own
experience
,
and
which
is
a
kind
of
wilful
and
self
-
bandaging
blindness
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
the
blindness
of
party
,
ma'am
,
and
public
men
,
which
is
the
blindness
of
a
mad
bull
in
the
midst
of
a
regiment
of
soldiers
clothed
in
red
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
the
blind
confidence
of
youth
,
which
is
the
blindness
of
young
kittens
,
whose
eyes
have
not
yet
opened
on
the
world
;
and
there
is
that
physical
blindness
,
ma'am
,
of
which
I
am
,
contrairy
to
my
own
desire
,
a
most
illustrious
example
.
 
<EOS>
Added
to
these
,
ma'am
,
is
that
blindness
of
the
intellect
,
of
which
we
have
a
specimen
in
your
interesting
son
,
and
which
,
having
sometimes
glimmerings
and
dawnings
of
the
light
,
is
scarcely
to
be
trusted
as
a
total
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
ma'am
,
I
have
taken
the
liberty
to
get
him
out
of
the
way
for
a
short
time
,
while
you
and
I
confer
together
,
and
this
precaution
arising
out
of
the
delicacy
of
my
sentiments
towards
yourself
,
you
will
excuse
me
,
ma'am
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Having
delivered
himself
of
this
speech
with
many
flourishes
of
manner
,
he
drew
from
beneath
his
coat
a
flat
stone
bottle
,
and
holding
the
cork
between
his
teeth
,
qualified
his
mug
of
water
with
a
plentiful
infusion
of
the
liquor
it
contained
.
 
<EOS>
He
politely
drained
the
bumper
to
her
health
,
and
the
ladies
,
and
setting
it
down
empty
,
smacked
his
lips
with
infinite
relish
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
citizen
of
the
world
,
ma'am
,
"
said
the
blind
man
,
corking
his
bottle
,
"
and
if
I
seem
to
conduct
myself
with
freedom
,
it
is
therefore
.
 
<EOS>
You
wonder
who
I
am
,
ma'am
,
and
what
has
brought
me
here
.
 
<EOS>
Such
experience
of
human
nature
as
I
have
,
leads
me
to
that
conclusion
,
without
the
aid
of
eyes
by
which
to
read
the
movements
of
your
soul
as
depicted
in
your
feminine
features
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
satisfy
your
curiosity
immediately
,
ma'am
;
immediately
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
that
he
slapped
his
bottle
on
its
broad
back
,
and
having
put
it
under
his
garment
as
before
,
crossed
his
legs
and
folded
his
hands
,
and
settled
himself
in
his
chair
,
previous
to
proceeding
any
further
.
  
<EOS>
The
change
in
his
manner
was
so
unexpected
,
the
craft
and
wickedness
of
his
deportment
were
so
much
aggravated
by
his
condition
---
for
we
are
accustomed
to
see
in
those
who
have
lost
a
human
sense
,
something
in
its
place
almost
divine
---
and
this
alteration
bred
so
many
fears
in
her
whom
he
addressed
,
that
she
could
not
pronounce
one
word
.
 
<EOS>
After
waiting
,
as
it
seemed
,
for
some
remark
or
answer
,
and
waiting
in
vain
,
the
visitor
resumed
:
  
"
Madam
,
my
name
is
Stagg
.
 
<EOS>
A
friend
of
mine
who
has
desired
the
honour
of
meeting
with
you
any
time
these
five
years
past
,
has
commissioned
me
to
call
upon
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
be
glad
to
whisper
that
gentleman
's
name
in
your
ear
.
<EOS>
---
Zounds
,
ma'am
,
are
you
deaf
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
me
say
that
I
should
be
glad
to
whisper
my
friend
's
name
in
your
ear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
repeat
it
,
"
said
the
widow
,
with
a
stifled
groan
;
"
I
see
too
well
from
whom
you
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
as
a
man
of
honour
,
ma'am
,
"
said
the
blind
man
,
striking
himself
on
the
breast
,
"
whose
credentials
must
not
be
disputed
<EOS>
,
I
take
leave
to
say
that
I
WILL
mention
that
gentleman
's
name
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
ay
,
"
he
added
,
seeming
to
catch
with
his
quick
ear
the
very
motion
of
her
hand
,
"
but
not
aloud
.
 
<EOS>
With
your
leave
,
ma'am
,
I
desire
the
favour
of
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
moved
towards
him
,
and
stooped
down
.
 
<EOS>
He
muttered
a
word
in
her
ear
;
and
,
wringing
her
hands
,
she
paced
up
and
down
the
room
like
one
distracted
.
 
<EOS>
The
blind
man
,
with
perfect
composure
,
produced
his
bottle
again
,
mixed
another
glassful
;
put
it
up
as
before
;
and
,
drinking
from
time
to
time
,
followed
her
with
his
face
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
slow
in
conversation
,
widow
,
"
he
said
after
a
time
,
pausing
in
his
draught
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
have
to
talk
before
your
son
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
would
you
have
me
do
?
<EOS>
"
she
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
poor
,
widow
,
we
are
poor
,
"
he
retorted
,
stretching
out
his
right
hand
,
and
rubbing
his
thumb
upon
its
palm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
what
am
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Comparisons
are
odious
,
"
said
the
blind
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
I
do
n't
care
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
that
we
are
poor
.
 
<EOS>
My
friend
's
circumstances
are
indifferent
,
and
so
are
mine
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
have
our
rights
,
widow
,
or
we
must
be
bought
off
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
know
that
,
as
well
as
I
,
so
where
is
the
use
of
talking
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
still
walked
wildly
to
and
fro
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
stopping
abruptly
before
him
,
she
said
:
  
"
Is
he
near
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
.
 
<EOS>
Close
at
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
am
lost
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
lost
,
widow
,
"
said
the
blind
man
,
calmly
;
"
only
found
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
call
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
for
the
world
,
"
she
answered
,
with
a
shudder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
"
he
replied
,
crossing
his
legs
again
,
for
he
had
made
as
though
he
would
rise
and
walk
to
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
you
please
,
widow
.
 
<EOS>
His
presence
is
not
necessary
that
I
know
of
.
 
<EOS>
But
both
he
and
I
must
live
;
to
live
,
we
must
eat
and
drink
;
to
eat
and
drink
,
we
must
have
money
:
<EOS>
---
I
say
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
how
pinched
and
destitute
<EOS>
I
am
?
"
<EOS>
she
retorted
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
you
do
,
or
can
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
had
eyes
,
and
could
look
around
you
on
this
poor
place
,
you
would
have
pity
on
me
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
let
your
heart
be
softened
by
your
own
affliction
,
friend
,
and
have
some
sympathy
with
mine
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
blind
man
snapped
his
fingers
as
he
answered
:
  
"
---
<EOS>
Beside
the
question
,
ma'am
,
beside
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
the
softest
heart
in
the
world
,
but
I
ca
n't
live
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
Many
a
gentleman
lives
well
upon
a
soft
head
,
who
would
find
a
heart
of
the
same
quality
a
very
great
drawback
.
 
<EOS>
Listen
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
a
matter
of
business
,
with
which
sympathies
and
sentiments
have
nothing
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
As
a
mutual
friend
,
I
wish
to
arrange
it
in
a
satisfactory
manner
,
if
possible
;
and
thus
the
case
stands
.
<EOS>
---
If
you
are
very
poor
now
,
it
's
your
own
choice
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
friends
who
,
in
case
of
need
,
are
always
ready
to
help
you
.
 
<EOS>
My
friend
is
in
a
more
destitute
and
desolate
situation
than
most
men
,
and
,
you
and
he
being
linked
together
in
a
common
cause
,
he
naturally
looks
to
you
to
assist
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
boarded
and
lodged
with
me
a
long
time
(
for
as
I
said
just
now
,
I
am
very
soft
-
hearted
)
,
and
I
quite
approve
of
his
entertaining
this
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
always
had
a
roof
over
your
head
;
he
has
always
been
an
outcast
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
your
son
to
comfort
and
assist
you
;
he
has
nobody
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
The
advantages
must
not
be
all
one
side
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
in
the
same
boat
,
and
we
must
divide
the
ballast
a
little
more
equally
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
about
to
speak
,
but
he
checked
her
,
and
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
only
way
of
doing
this
,
is
by
making
up
a
little
purse
now
and
then
for
my
friend
;
and
that
's
what
I
advise
.
 
<EOS>
He
bears
you
no
malice
that
I
know
of
,
<EOS>
ma'am
:
<EOS>
so
little
,
that
although
you
have
treated
him
harshly
more
than
once
,
and
driven
him
,
I
may
say
,
out
of
doors
,
he
has
that
regard
for
you
that
I
believe
even
if
you
disappointed
him
now
,
he
would
consent
to
take
charge
of
your
son
,
and
to
make
a
man
of
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
laid
a
great
stress
on
these
latter
words
,
and
paused
as
if
to
find
out
what
effect
they
had
produced
.
 
<EOS>
She
only
answered
by
her
tears
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
likely
lad
,
"
said
the
blind
man
,
thoughtfully
,
"
for
many
purposes
,
and
not
ill
-
disposed
to
try
his
fortune
in
a
little
change
and
bustle
,
if
I
may
judge
from
what
I
heard
of
his
talk
with
you
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
---
Come
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
my
friend
has
pressing
necessity
for
twenty
pounds
.
 
<EOS>
You
,
who
can
give
up
an
annuity
,
can
get
that
sum
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
pity
you
should
be
troubled
.
 
<EOS>
You
seem
very
comfortable
here
,
and
it
's
worth
that
much
to
remain
so
.
<EOS>
Twenty
pounds
,
widow
,
is
a
moderate
demand
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
where
to
apply
for
it
;
a
post
will
bring
it
you
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Twenty
pounds
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
about
to
answer
him
again
,
but
again
he
stopped
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
say
anything
hastily
;
you
might
be
sorry
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
Think
of
it
a
little
while
.
 
<EOS>
Twenty
pounds
---
of
other
people
's
money
---
how
easy
!
 
<EOS>
Turn
it
over
in
your
mind
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
in
no
hurry
.
 
<EOS>
Night
's
coming
on
,
and
if
I
do
n't
sleep
here
,
I
shall
not
go
far
.
 
<EOS>
Twenty
pounds
!
<EOS>
Consider
of
it
,
ma'am
,
for
twenty
minutes
;
give
each
pound
a
minute
;
that
's
a
fair
allowance
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
enjoy
the
air
the
while
,
which
is
very
mild
and
pleasant
in
these
parts
.
<EOS>
"
  
With
these
words
he
groped
his
way
to
the
door
,
carrying
his
chair
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
Then
seating
himself
,
under
a
spreading
honeysuckle
,
and
stretching
his
legs
across
the
threshold
so
that
no
person
could
pass
in
or
out
without
his
knowledge
,
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
pipe
,
flint
,
steel
and
tinder
-
box
,
and
began
to
smoke
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
lovely
evening
,
of
that
gentle
kind
,
and
at
that
time
of
year
,
when
the
twilight
is
most
beautiful
.
 
<EOS>
Pausing
now
and
then
to
let
his
smoke
curl
slowly
off
,
and
to
sniff
the
grateful
fragrance
of
the
flowers
,
he
sat
there
at
his
ease
---
as
though
the
cottage
were
his
proper
dwelling
,
and
he
had
held
undisputed
possession
of
it
all
his
life
---
waiting
for
the
widow
's
answer
and
for
Barnaby
's
return
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
46
    
<EOS>
When
Barnaby
returned
with
the
bread
,
the
sight
of
the
pious
old
pilgrim
smoking
his
pipe
and
making
himself
so
thoroughly
at
home
,
appeared
to
surprise
even
him
;
the
more
so
,
as
that
worthy
person
,
instead
of
putting
up
the
loaf
in
his
wallet
as
a
scarce
and
precious
article
,
tossed
it
carelessly
on
the
table
,
and
producing
his
bottle
,
bade
him
sit
down
and
drink
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
I
carry
some
comfort
,
you
see
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Taste
that
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
good
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
water
stood
in
Barnaby
's
eyes
as
he
coughed
from
the
strength
of
the
draught
,
and
answered
in
the
affirmative
.
  
<EOS>
"
Drink
some
more
,
"
said
the
blind
man
;
"
do
n't
be
afraid
of
it
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
taste
anything
like
that
,
often
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Often
!
"
cried
Barnaby
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Too
poor
?
"
returned
the
blind
man
with
a
sigh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
bad
.
<EOS>
Your
mother
,
poor
soul
,
would
be
happier
if
she
was
richer
,
Barnaby
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
so
I
tell
her
---
the
very
thing
I
told
her
just
before
you
came
to
-
night
,
when
all
that
gold
was
in
the
sky
,
"
said
Barnaby
,
drawing
his
chair
nearer
to
him
,
and
looking
eagerly
in
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
Is
there
any
way
of
being
rich
,
that
I
could
find
out
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Any
way
!
 
<EOS>
A
hundred
ways
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
?
<EOS>
"
he
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
say
so
?
 
<EOS>
What
are
they
?
---
<EOS>
Nay
,
mother
,
it
's
for
your
sake
<EOS>
I
ask
;
not
mine
;
---
for
yours
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
What
are
they
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
blind
man
turned
his
face
,
on
which
there
was
a
smile
of
triumph
,
to
where
the
widow
stood
in
great
distress
;
and
answered
,
  
"
Why
,
they
are
not
to
be
found
out
by
stay
-
at
-
homes
,
my
good
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
stay
-
at
-
homes
!
"
cried
Barnaby
,
plucking
at
his
sleeve
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
not
one
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
there
you
mistake
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
often
out
before
the
sun
,
and
travel
home
when
he
has
gone
to
rest
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
away
in
the
woods
before
the
day
has
reached
the
shady
places
,
and
am
often
there
when
the
bright
moon
is
peeping
through
the
boughs
,
and
looking
down
upon
the
other
moon
that
lives
in
the
water
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
walk
along
,
I
try
to
find
,
among
the
grass
and
moss
,
some
of
that
small
money
for
which
she
works
so
hard
and
used
to
shed
so
many
tears
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
lie
asleep
in
the
shade
,
I
dream
of
it
---
<EOS>
dream
of
digging
it
up
in
heaps
;
and
spying
it
out
,
hidden
under
bushes
;
and
seeing
it
sparkle
,
as
the
dew
-
drops
do
,
among
the
leaves
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
never
find
it
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
where
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
go
there
,
if
the
journey
were
a
whole
year
long
,
because
I
know
she
would
be
happier
when
I
came
home
and
brought
some
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
Speak
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
listen
to
you
if
you
talk
all
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
blind
man
passed
his
hand
lightly
over
the
poor
fellow
's
face
,
and
finding
that
his
elbows
were
planted
on
the
table
,
that
his
chin
rested
on
his
two
hands
,
that
he
leaned
eagerly
forward
,
and
that
his
whole
manner
expressed
the
utmost
interest
and
anxiety
,
paused
for
a
minute
as
though
he
desired
the
widow
to
observe
this
fully
,
and
then
made
answer
:
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
in
the
world
,
bold
Barnaby
,
the
merry
world
;
not
in
solitary
places
like
those
you
pass
your
time
in
,
but
in
crowds
,
and
where
there
's
noise
and
rattle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
!
good
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Barnaby
,
rubbing
his
hands
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
I
love
that
.
 
<EOS>
Grip
loves
it
too
.
 
<EOS>
It
suits
us
both
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
brave
!
"
  
"
<EOS>
---
The
kind
of
places
,
"
said
the
blind
man
,
"
that
a
young
fellow
likes
,
and
in
which
a
good
son
may
do
more
for
his
mother
,
and
himself
to
boot
,
in
a
month
,
than
he
could
here
in
all
his
life
---
 
that
is
,
if
he
had
a
friend
,
you
know
,
and
some
one
to
advise
with
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
hear
this
,
mother
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Barnaby
,
turning
to
her
with
delight
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
tell
me
we
should
n't
heed
it
,
if
it
lay
shining
at
out
feet
.
 
<EOS>
Why
do
we
heed
it
so
much
now
?
 
<EOS>
Why
do
you
toil
from
morning
until
night
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Surely
,
"
said
the
blind
man
,
"
surely
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
no
answer
,
widow
?
<EOS>
Is
your
mind
,
"
he
slowly
added
,
"
not
made
up
yet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
speak
with
you
,
"
she
answered
,
"
apart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lay
your
hand
upon
my
sleeve
,
"
said
Stagg
,
arising
from
the
table
;
"
and
lead
me
where
you
will
.
 
<EOS>
Courage
,
bold
Barnaby
.
 
<EOS>
We
'll
talk
more
of
this
<EOS>
:
I
've
a
fancy
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
Wait
there
till
I
come
back
.
<EOS>
Now
,
widow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
led
him
out
at
the
door
,
and
into
the
little
garden
,
where
they
stopped
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
fit
agent
,
"
she
said
,
in
a
half
breathless
manner
,
"
and
well
represent
the
man
who
sent
you
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
him
that
you
said
so
,
"
Stagg
retorted
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
a
regard
for
you
,
and
will
respect
me
the
more
(
if
possible
)
for
your
praise
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
have
our
rights
,
widow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Rights
!
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
,
"
she
said
,
"
that
a
word
from
me
---
"
  
"
Why
do
you
stop
?
<EOS>
"
returned
the
blind
man
calmly
,
after
a
long
pause
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
I
know
that
a
word
from
you
would
place
my
friend
in
the
last
position
of
the
dance
of
life
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
What
of
that
?
<EOS>
It
will
never
be
spoken
,
widow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
sure
of
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
---
so
sure
,
that
I
do
n't
come
here
to
discuss
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
we
must
have
our
rights
,
or
we
must
be
bought
off
.
 
<EOS>
Keep
to
that
point
,
or
let
me
return
to
my
young
friend
,
for
I
have
an
interest
in
the
lad
,
and
desire
to
put
him
in
the
way
of
making
his
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
Bah
!
<EOS>
you
need
n't
speak
,
"
he
added
hastily
;
"
I
know
what
you
would
say
:
you
have
hinted
at
it
once
already
.
 
<EOS>
Have
I
no
feeling
for
you
,
because
I
am
blind
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
I
have
not
.
 
<EOS>
Why
do
you
expect
me
,
being
in
darkness
,
to
be
better
than
men
who
have
their
sight
<EOS>
---
why
should
you
?
 
<EOS>
Is
the
hand
of
Heaven
more
manifest
in
my
having
no
eyes
,
than
in
your
having
two
?
 
<EOS>
It
's
the
ca
nt
of
you
<EOS>
folks
to
be
horrified
if
a
blind
man
robs
,
or
lies
,
or
steals
<EOS>
;
oh
yes
,
it
's
far
worse
in
him
,
who
can
barely
live
on
the
few
halfpence
that
are
thrown
to
him
in
streets
,
than
in
you
,
who
can
see
,
and
work
,
and
are
not
dependent
on
the
mercies
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
A
curse
on
you
!
 
<EOS>
You
who
have
five
senses
may
be
wicked
at
your
pleasure
;
we
who
have
four
,
and
want
the
most
important
,
are
to
live
and
be
moral
on
our
affliction
.
 
<EOS>
The
true
charity
and
justice
of
rich
to
poor
,
all
the
world
over
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
paused
a
moment
when
he
had
said
these
words
,
and
caught
the
sound
of
money
,
jingling
in
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
he
cried
,
quickly
resuming
his
former
manner
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
should
lead
to
something
.
 
<EOS>
The
point
,
widow
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
First
answer
me
one
question
,
"
she
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
say
he
is
close
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Has
he
left
London
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Being
close
at
hand
,
widow
,
it
would
seem
he
has
,
"
returned
the
blind
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
for
good
?
 
<EOS>
You
know
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
for
good
.
 
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
widow
,
that
his
making
a
longer
stay
there
might
have
had
disagreeable
consequences
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
come
away
for
that
reason
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Listen
,
"
said
the
widow
,
telling
some
money
out
,
upon
a
bench
beside

"
Count

<EOS>
"
Six
,
"
said
the
blind
man
,
listening
attentively
.
 
<EOS>
"
Any
more
?
"
  
"
They
are
the
savings
,
"
she
answered
,
"
of
five
years
.
 
<EOS>
Six
guineas
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
put
out
his
hand
for
one
of
the
coins
;
felt
it
carefully
,
put
it
between
his
teeth
,
rung
it
on
the
bench
;
and
nodded
to
her
to
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
"
These
have
been
scraped
together
and
laid
by
,
lest
sickness
or
death
should
separate
my
son
and
me
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
been
purchased
at
the
price
of
much
hunger
,
hard
labour
,
and
want
of
rest
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
CAN
take
them
---
do
---
on
condition
that
you
leave
this
place
upon
the
instant
,
and
enter
no
more
into
that
room
,
where
he
sits
now
,
expecting
your
return
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Six
guineas
,
"
said
the
blind
man
,
shaking
his
head
,
"
though
of
the
fullest
weight
that
were
ever
coined
,
fall
very
far
short

twenty
pounds

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
such
a
sum
,
as
you
know
,
I
must
write
to
a
distant
part
of
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
To
do
that
,
and
receive
an
answer
,
I
must
have
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Two
days

said
Stagg
.
  
<EOS>
"
More
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Four
days

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
A
week
.
 
<EOS>
Return
on
this
day
week
,
at
the
same
hour
,
but
not
to
the
house

<EOS>
Wait
at
the
corner
of
the
lane
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
said
the
blind
man
,
with
a
crafty
look
,
"
I
shall
find
you
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
else
can
I
take
refuge
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
not
enough
that
you
have
made
a
beggar
of
me
,
and
that
I
have
sacrificed
my
whole
store
,
so
hardly
earned
,
to
preserve
this
home
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
blind
man
,
after
some
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
"
Set
me
with
my
face
towards
the
point
you
speak
of
,
and
in
the
middle
of
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
Is
this
the
spot
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
this
day
week
at
sunset
.
 
<EOS>
And
think
of
him
within
doors
.
<EOS>
---
For
the
present
,
good
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
made
him
no
answer
,
nor
did
he
stop
for
any
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
slowly
away
,
turning
his
head
from
time
to
time
,
and
stopping
to
listen
,
as
if
he
were
curious
to
know
whether
he
was
watched
by
any
one
.
<EOS>
The
shadows
of
night
were
closing
fast
around
,
and
he
was
soon
lost
in
the
gloom
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
,
however
,
until
she
had
traversed
the
lane
from
end
to
end
,
and
made
sure
that
he
was
gone
,
that
she
re
-
entered
the
cottage
,
and
hurriedly
barred
the
door
and
window
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
!
"
said
Barnaby
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
 
<EOS>
Where
is
the
blind
man
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
gone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Gone
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
starting
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
have
more
talk
with
him
.
<EOS>
Which
way
did
he
take
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
she
answered
,
folding
her
arms
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
go
out
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
ghosts
and
dreams
abroad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
?
<EOS>
"
said
Barnaby
,
in
a
frightened
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
safe
to
stir
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
leave
this
place
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
place
!
 
<EOS>
This
cottage
---
and
the
little
garden
,
mother
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
 
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
morning
at
sunrise
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
travel
to
London
;
lose
ourselves
in
that
wide
place
---
there
would
be
some
trace
of
us
in
any
other
town
---
then
travel
on
again
,
and
find
some
new
abode
.
"
  
<EOS>
Little
persuasion
was
required
to
reconcile
Barnaby
to
anything
that
promised
change
.
 
<EOS>
In
another
minute
,
he
was
wild
with
delight
;
in
another
,
full
of
grief
at
the
prospect
of
parting
with
his
friends
the
dogs
;
in
another
,
wild
again
;
then
he
was
fearful
of
what
she
had
said
to
prevent
his
wandering
abroad
that
night
,
and
full
of
terrors
and
strange
questions
.
 
<EOS>
His
light
-
heartedness
in
the
end
surmounted
all
his
other
feelings
,
and
lying
down
in
his
clothes
to
the
end
that
he
might
be
ready
on
the
morrow
,
he
soon
fell
fast
asleep
before
the
poor
turf
fire
.
  
<EOS>
His
mother
did
not
close
her
eyes
,
but
sat
beside
him
,
watching
.
<EOS>
Every
breath
of
wind
sounded
in
her
ears
like
that
dreaded
footstep
at
the
door
,
or
like
that
hand
upon
the
latch
,
and
made
the
calm
summer
night
,
a
night
of
horror
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
the
welcome
day
appeared
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
had
made
the
little
preparations
which
were
needful
for
their
journey
,
and
had
prayed
upon
her
knees
with
many
tears
,
she
roused
Barnaby
,
who
jumped
up
gaily
at
her
summons
.
  
<EOS>
His
clothes
were
few
enough
,
and
to
carry
Grip
was
a
labour
of
love
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
sun
shed
his
earliest
beams
upon
the
earth
,
they
closed
the
door
of
their
deserted
home
,
and
turned
away
.
 
<EOS>
The
sky
was
blue
and
bright
.
 
<EOS>
The
air
was
fresh
and
filled
with
a
thousand
perfumes
.
 
<EOS>
Barnaby
looked
upward
,
and
laughed
with
all
his
heart
.
  
<EOS>
But
it
was
a
day
he
usually
devoted
to
a
long
ramble
,
and
one
of
the
dogs
---
the
ugliest
of
them
all
---
came
bounding
up
,
and
jumping
round
him
in
the
fulness
of
his
joy
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
to
bid
him
go
back
in
a
surly
tone
,
and
his
heart
smote
him
while
he
did
so
.
 
<EOS>
The
dog
retreated
;
turned
with
a
half
-
incredulous
,
half
-
imploring
look
;
came
a
little
back
;
and
stopped
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
last
appeal
of
an
old
companion
and
a
faithful
friend
---
 
cast
off
.
 
<EOS>
Barnaby
could
bear
no
more
,
and
as
he
shook
his
head
and
waved
his
playmate
home
,
he
burst
into
tears
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
mother
,
mother
,
how
mournful
he
will
be
when
he
scratches
at
the
door
,
and
finds
it
always
shut
!
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
such
a
sense
of
home
in
the
thought
,
<EOS>
that
though
her
own
eyes
overflowed
she
would
not
have
obliterated
the
recollection
of
it
,
either
from
her
own
mind
or
from
his
,
for
the
wealth
of
the
whole
wide
world
.

Chapter
47
    
<EOS>
In
the
exhaustless
catalogue
of
Heaven
's
mercies
to
mankind
,
the
power
we
have
of
finding
some
germs
of
comfort
in
the
hardest
trials
must
ever
occupy
the
foremost
place
;
not
only
because
it
supports
and
upholds
us
when
we
most
require
to
be
sustained
,
but
because
in
this
source
of
consolation
there
is
something
,
we
have
reason
to
believe
,
of
the
divine
spirit
;
something
of
that
goodness
which
detects
amidst
our
own
evil
doings
,
a
redeeming
quality
;
something
which
,
even
in
our
fallen
nature
,
we
possess
in
common
with
the
angels
;
which
had
its
being
in
the
old
time
when
they
trod
the
earth
,
and
lingers
on
it
yet
,
in
pity
.
  
<EOS>
How
often
,
on
their
journey
,
did
the
widow
remember
with
a
grateful
heart
,
that
out
of
his
deprivation
Barnaby
's
cheerfulness
and
affection
sprung
!
 
<EOS>
How
often
did
she
call
to
mind
that
but
for
that
,
he
might
have
been
sullen
,
morose
,
unkind
,
far
removed
from
her
---
<EOS>
vicious
,
perhaps
,
and
cruel
!
 
<EOS>
How
often
had
she
cause
for
comfort
,
in
his
strength
,
and
hope
,
and
in
his
simple
nature
!
<EOS>
Those
feeble
powers
of
mind
which
rendered
him
so
soon
forgetful
of
the
past
,
save
in
brief
gleams
and
flashes
,
---
even
they
were
a
comfort
now
.
 
<EOS>
The
world
to
him
was
full
of
happiness
;
in
every
tree
,
and
plant
,
and
flower
,
in
every
bird
,
and
beast
,
and
tiny
insect
whom
a
breath
of
summer
wind
laid
low
upon
the
ground
,
he
had
delight
.
 
<EOS>
His
delight
was
hers
;
and
where
many
a
wise
son
would
have
made
her
sorrowful
,
this
poor
light
-
hearted
idiot
filled
her
breast
with
thankfulness
and
love
.
  
<EOS>
Their
stock
of
money
was
low
,
but
from
the
hoard
she
had
told
into
the
blind
man
's
hand
,
the
widow
had
withheld
one
guinea
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
with
the
few
pence
she
possessed
besides
,
was
to
two
persons
of
their
frugal
habits
,
a
goodly
sum
in
bank
.
 
<EOS>
Moreover
they
had
Grip
in
company
;
and
when
they
must
otherwise
have
changed
the
guinea
,
it
was
but
to
make
him
exhibit
outside
an
alehouse
door
,
or
in
a
village
street
,
or
in
the
grounds
or
gardens
of
a
mansion
of
the
better
sort
,
and
scores
who
would
have
given
nothing
in
charity
,
were
ready
to
bargain
for
more
amusement
from
the
talking
bird
.
  
<EOS>
One
day
---
for
they
moved
slowly
,
and
although
they
had
many
rides
in
carts
and
waggons
,
were
on
the
road
a
week
---
<EOS>
Barnaby
,
with
Grip
upon
his
shoulder
and
his
mother
following
,
begged
permission
at
a
trim
lodge
to
go
up
to
the
great
house
,
at
the
other
end
of
the
avenue
,
and
show
his
raven
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
within
was
inclined
to
give
them
admittance
,
and
was
indeed
about
to
do
so
,
when
a
stout
gentleman
with
a
long
whip
in
his
hand
,
and
a
flushed
face
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
he
had
had
his
morning
's
draught
,
rode
up
to
the
gate
,
and
called
in
a
loud
voice
and
with
more
oaths
than
the
occasion
seemed
to
warrant
to
have
it
opened
directly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
hast
thou
got
here
?
"
said
the
gentleman
angrily
,
as
the
man
threw
the
gate
wide
open
,
and
pulled
off
his
hat
,
"
who
are
these
?
<EOS>
Eh
?
<EOS>
art
<EOS>
a
beggar
,
woman
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
widow
answered
with
a
curtsey
,
that
they
were
poor
travellers
.
  
<EOS>
"
Vagrants
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
"
vagrants
and
vagabonds
.
 
<EOS>
Thee
wish
to
be
made
acquainted
with
the
cage
,
dost
thee
---
the
cage
,
the
stocks
,
and
the
whipping
-
post
?
 
<EOS>
Where
dost
come
from
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
told
him
in
a
timid
manner
,
---
for
he
was
very
loud
,
hoarse
,
and
red
-
faced
,
---
and
besought
him
not
to
be
angry
,
for
they
meant
no
harm
,
and
would
go
upon
their
way
that
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
he
too
sure
of
that
<EOS>
,
"
replied
the
gentleman
,
"
we
do
n't
allow
vagrants
to
roam
about
this
place
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
what
thou
want'st
---
stray
linen
drying
on
hedges
,
and
stray
poultry
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
What
hast
got
in
that
basket
,
lazy
hound
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Grip
,
Grip
,
<EOS>
Grip
---
<EOS>
Grip
the
clever
,
Grip
<EOS>
the
wicked
,
Grip
<EOS>
the
knowing
---
Grip
,
Grip
,
Grip

"
cried
the
raven
,
whom
Barnaby
had
shut
up
on
the
approach
of
this
stern
personage
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
devil
<EOS>
I
'm
a
devil
<EOS>
I
'm
a
devil
,
Never
say
die
<EOS>
Hurrah
Bow
<EOS>
wow
<EOS>
wow
,
Polly
put
the
kettle
on
<EOS>
we
'll
all
have
tea
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Take
the
vermin
out
,
scoundrel
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
"
and
let
me
see
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Barnaby
,
thus
condescendingly
addressed
,
produced
his
bird
,
but
not
without
much
fear
and
trembling
,
and
set
him
down
upon
the
ground
;
which
he
had
no
sooner
done
than
Grip
drew
fifty
corks
at
least
,
and
then
began
to
dance
;
at
the
same
time
eyeing
the
gentleman
with
surprising
insolence
of
manner
,
and
screwing
his
head
so
much
on
one
side
that
he
appeared
desirous
of
screwing
it
off
upon
the
spot
.
  
<EOS>
The
cork
-
drawing
seemed
to
make
a
greater
impression
on
the
gentleman
's
mind
,
than
the
raven
's
power
of
speech
,
and
was
indeed
particularly
adapted
to
his
habits
and
capacity
.
 
<EOS>
He
desired
to
have
that
done
again
,
but
despite
his
being
very
peremptory
,
and
notwithstanding
that
Barnaby
coaxed
to
the
utmost
,
Grip
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
the
request
,
and
preserved
a
dead
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bring
him
along
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
pointing
to
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
But
Grip
,
who
had
watched
the
action
,
anticipated
his
master
,
by
hopping
on
before
them
;
---
constantly
flapping
his
wings
,
and
screaming
"
cook
!
"
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
as
a
hint
perhaps
that
there
was
company
coming
,
and
a
small
collation
would
be
acceptable
.
  
<EOS>
Barnaby
and
his
mother
walked
on
,
on
either
side
of
the
gentleman
on
horseback
,
who
surveyed
each
of
them
from
time
to
time
in
a
proud
and
coarse
manner
,
and
occasionally
thundered
out
some
question
,
the
tone
of
which
alarmed
Barnaby
so
much
that
he
could
find
no
answer
,
and
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
could
make
him
no
reply
.
 
<EOS>
On
one
of
these
occasions
,
when
the
gentleman
appeared
disposed
to
exercise
his
horsewhip
,
the
widow
ventured
to
inform
him
in
a
low
voice
and
with
tears
in
her
eyes
,
that
her
son
was
of
weak
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
An
idiot
,
eh
?
"
said
the
gentleman
,
looking
at
Barnaby
as
he
spoke
.
<EOS>
"
And
how
long
hast
thou
been
an
idiot
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
knows
,
"
was
Barnaby
's
timid
answer
,
pointing
to
his
mother
---
 
<EOS>
"
I
---
always
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
From
his
birth
,
"
said
the
widow
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
it
,
"
cried
the
gentleman
,
"
not
a
bit
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
an
excuse
not
to
work
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
nothing
like
flogging
to
cure
that
disorder
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
make
a
difference
in
him
in
ten
minutes
,
I
'll
be
bound
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Heaven
has
made
none
in
more
than
twice
ten
years
,
sir
,
"
said
the
widow
mildly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
why
do
n't
you
shut
him
up
?
<EOS>
we
pay
enough
for
county
institutions
,
damn
'em
.
 
<EOS>
But
thou'd
rather
drag
him
about
to
excite
charity
---
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
I
know
thee
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Now
,
this
gentleman
had
various
endearing
appellations
among
his
intimate
friends
.
 
<EOS>
By
some
he
was
called
"
a
country
gentleman
of
the
true
school
,
"
by
some
"
a
fine
old
country
gentleman
,
"
by
some
"
a
sporting
gentleman
,
"
by
some
"
a
thorough
-
bred
Englishman
,
"
by
some
"
a
genuine
John
Bull
;
"
but
they
all
agreed
in
one
respect
,
and
that
was
,
that
it
was
a
pity
there
were
not
more
like
him
,
and
that
because
there
were
not
,
the
country
was
going
to
rack
and
ruin
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
in
the
commission
of
the
peace
,
and
could
write
his
name
almost
legibly
;
but
his
greatest
qualifications
were
,
that
he
was
more
severe
with
poachers
,
<EOS>
was
a
better
shot
,
a
harder
rider
,
had
better
horses
,
kept
better
dogs
,
could
eat
more
solid
food
,
drink
more
strong
wine
,
go
to
bed
every
night
more
drunk
and
get
up
every
morning
more
sober
,
than
any
man
in
the
county
.
 
<EOS>
In
knowledge
of
horseflesh
he
was
almost
equal
to
a
farrier
,
in
stable
learning
he
surpassed
his
own
head
groom
,
and
in
gluttony
not
a
pig
on
his
estate
was
a
match
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
no
seat
in
Parliament
himself
,
but
he
was
extremely
patriotic
,
and
usually
drove
his
voters
up
to
the
poll
with
his
own
hands
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
warmly
attached
to
church
and
state
,
and
never
appointed
to
the
living
in
his
gift
any
but
a
three
-
bottle
man
and
a
first
-
rate
fox
-
hunter
.
 
<EOS>
He
mistrusted
the
honesty
of
all
poor
people
who
could
read
and
write
,
and
had
a
secret
jealousy
of
his
own
wife
(
a
young
lady
whom
he
had
married
for
what
his
friends
called
"
the
good
old
English
reason
,
"
that
her
father
's
property
adjoined
his
own
)
for
possessing
those
accomplishments
in
a
greater
degree
than
himself
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
Barnaby
being
an
idiot
,
and
Grip
a
creature
of
mere
brute
instinct
,
it
would
be
very
hard
to
say
what
this
gentleman
was
.
  
<EOS>
He
rode
up
to
the
door
of
a
handsome
house
approached
by
a
great
flight
of
steps
,
where
a
man
was
waiting
to
take
his
horse
,
and
led
the
way
into
a
large
hall
,
which
,
spacious
as
it
was
,
was
tainted
with
the
fumes
of
last
night
's
stale
debauch
.
 
<EOS>
Greatcoats
,
riding
-
whips
,
bridles
,
top
-
boots
,
spurs
,
and
such
gear
,
were
strewn
about
on
all
sides
,
and
formed
,
with
some
huge
stags
'
antlers
,
and
a
few
portraits
of
dogs
and
horses
,
its
principal
embellishments
.
  
<EOS>
Throwing
himself
into
a
great
chair
(
in
which
,
by
the
bye
,
he
often
snored
away
the
night
,
when
he
had
been
,
according
to
his
admirers
,
a
finer
country
gentleman
than
usual
)
<EOS>
he
bade
the
man
to
tell
his
mistress
to
come
down
:
and
presently
there
appeared
,
a
little
flurried
,
as
it
seemed
,
by
the
unwonted
summons
,
a
lady
much
younger
than
himself
,
who
had
the
appearance
of
being
in
delicate
health
,
and
not
too
happy
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
!
 
<EOS>
Thou'st
<EOS>
no
delight
in
following
the
hounds
as
an
Englishwoman
should
have
,
"
said
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
See
to
this
here
.
 
<EOS>
That
'll
please
thee
perhaps
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
lady
smiled
,
sat
down
at
a
little
distance
from
him
,
and
glanced
at
Barnaby
with
a
look
of
pity
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
an
idiot
,
the
woman
says
,
"
observed
the
gentleman
,
shaking
his
head
;
"
I
do
n't
believe
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
his
mother
?
"
asked
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
She
answered
yes
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
use
of
asking
HER
?
"
said
the
gentleman
,
thrusting
his
hands
into
his
breeches
pockets
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
'll
tell
thee
so
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
Most
likely
he
's
hired
,
at
so
much
a
day
.
 
<EOS>
There
.
 
<EOS>
Get
on
.
 
<EOS>
Make
him
do
something
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Grip
having
by
this
time
recovered
his
urbanity
,
condescended
,
at
Barnaby
's
solicitation
,
to
repeat
his
various
phrases
of
speech
,
and
to
go
through
the
whole
of
his
performances
with
the
utmost
success
.
 
<EOS>
The
corks
,
and
the
never
say
die
,
afforded
the
gentleman
so
much
delight
that
he
demanded
the
repetition
of
this
part
of
the
entertainment
,
until
Grip
got
into
his
basket
,
and
positively
refused
to
say
another
word
,
good
or
bad
.
 
<EOS>
The
lady
too
,
was
much
amused
with
him
;
and
the
closing
point
of
his
obstinacy
so
delighted
her
husband
that
he
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
,
and
demanded
his
price
.
  
<EOS>
Barnaby
looked
as
though
he
did
n't
understand
his
meaning
.
<EOS>
Probably
he
did
not
.
  
<EOS>
"
His
price
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
rattling
the
money
in
his
pockets
,
"
what
dost
want
for
him
?
 
<EOS>
How
much
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
not
to
be
sold
,
"
replied
Barnaby
,
shutting
up
the
basket
in
a
great
hurry
,
and
throwing
the
strap
over
his
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
come
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thou
seest
how
much
of
an
idiot
he
is
,
book
-
learner
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
looking
scornfully
at
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
can
make
a
bargain
.
<EOS>
What
dost
want
for
him
,
old
woman
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
my
son
's
constant
companion
,
"
said
the
widow
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
not
to
be
sold
,
sir
,
indeed
.
"
  
"
Not
to
be
sold
!
"
cried
the
gentleman
,
growing
ten
times
redder
,
hoarser
,
and
louder
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
to
be
sold
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
no
,
"
she
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
never
thought
of
parting
with
him
,
sir
,
I
do
assure
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
evidently
about
to
make
a
very
passionate
retort
,
when
a
few
murmured
words
from
his
wife
happening
to
catch
his
ear
,
he
turned
sharply
round
,
and
said
,
"
Eh
?
 
What
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
can
hardly
expect
them
to
sell
the
bird
,
against
their
own
desire
,
"
she
faltered
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
they
prefer
to
keep
him
---
"
  
"
Prefer
to
keep
him
!
"
<EOS>
he
echoed
.
 
<EOS>
"
These
people
,
who
go
tramping
about
the
country
a
-
pilfering
and
vagabondising
on
all
hands
,
prefer
to
keep
a
bird
,
when
a
landed
proprietor
and
a
justice
asks
his
price
!
 
<EOS>
That
old
woman
's
been
to
school
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
she
has
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
tell
me
no
<EOS>
,
"
he
roared
to
the
widow
,
"
I
say
,
yes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Barnaby
's
mother
pleaded
guilty
to
the
accusation
,
and
hoped
there
was
no
harm
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
harm
!
"
said
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
 
<EOS>
No
harm
.
 
<EOS>
No
harm
,
ye
old
rebel
,
not
a
bit
of
harm
.
 
<EOS>
If
my
clerk
was
here
,
I
'd
set
ye
in
the
stocks
,
<EOS>
I
would
,
or
lay
ye
in
jail
for
prowling
up
and
down
,
on
the
look
-
out
for
petty
larcenies
,
ye
limb
of
a
gipsy
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
Simon
,
put
these
pilferers
out
,
shove
'em
into
the
road
,
out
with
'em
!
 
<EOS>
Ye
do
n't
want
to
sell
the
bird
,
ye
that
come
here
to
beg
,
do
n't
ye
?
<EOS>
If
they
an't
out
in
double
-
quick
,
set
the
dogs
upon
'
em
!
"
  
<EOS>
They
waited
for
no
further
dismissal
,
but
fled
precipitately
,
leaving
the
gentleman
to
storm
away
by
himself
(
for
the
poor
lady
had
already
retreated
)
,
and
making
a
great
many
vain
attempts
to
silence
Grip
,
who
,
excited
by
the
noise
,
drew
corks
enough
for
a
city
feast
as
they
hurried
down
the
avenue
,
and
appeared
to
congratulate
himself
beyond
measure
on
having
been
the
cause
of
the
disturbance
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
had
nearly
reached
the
lodge
,
another
servant
,
emerging
from
the
shrubbery
,
feigned
to
be
very
active
in
ordering
them
off
,
but
this
man
put
a
crown
into
the
widow
's
hand
,
and
whispering
that
his
lady
sent
it
,
thrust
them
gently
from
the
gate
.
  
<EOS>
This
incident
only
suggested
to
the
widow
's
mind
,
when
they
halted
at
an
alehouse
some
miles
further
on
,
and
heard
the
justice
's
character
as
given
by
his
friends
,
that
perhaps
something
more
than
capacity
of
stomach
and
tastes
for
the
kennel
and
the
stable
,
were
required
to
form
either
a
perfect
country
gentleman
,
a
thoroughbred
Englishman
,
or
a
genuine
John
Bull
;
and
that
possibly
the
terms
were
sometimes
misappropriated
,
not
to
say
disgraced
.
 
<EOS>
She
<EOS>
little
thought
then
,
that
a
circumstance
so
slight
would
ever
influence
their
future
fortunes
;
but
time
and
experience
enlightened
her
in
this
respect
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
"
said
Barnaby
,
as
they
were
sitting
next
day
in
a
waggon
which
was
to
take
them
within
ten
miles
of
the
capital
,
"
we
're
going
to
London
first
,
you
said
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
we
see
that
blind
man
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
about
to
answer
"
Heaven
forbid
!
"
<EOS>
but
checked
herself
,
and
told
him
No
,
she
thought
not
;
why
did
he
ask
?
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
wise
man
,
"
said
Barnaby
,
with
a
thoughtful
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
that
we
may
meet
with
him
again
.
 
<EOS>
What
was
it
that
he
said
of
crowds
?
 
<EOS>
That
gold
was
to
be
found
where
people
crowded
,
and
not
among
the
trees
and
in
such
quiet
places
?
 
<EOS>
He
spoke
as
if
he
loved
it
;
London
is
a
crowded
place
;
I
think
we
shall
meet
him
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
why
do
you
desire
to
see
him
,
love
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
,
"
said
Barnaby
,
looking
wistfully
at
her
,
"
he
talked
to
me
about
gold
,
which
is
a
rare
thing
,
and
say
what
you
will
,
a
thing
you
would
like
to
have
,
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
And
because
he
came
and
went
away
so
strangely
---
just
as
white
-
headed
old
men
come
sometimes
to
my
bed
's
foot
in
the
night
,
and
say
what
I
ca
n't
remember
when
the
bright
day
returns
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
me
he
'd
come
back
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
why
he
broke
his
word
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
never
thought
of
being
rich
or
gay
,
before
,
dear
Barnaby
.
<EOS>
You
have
always
been
contented
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
laughed
and
bade
her
<EOS>
say
that
again
,
then
cried
,
"
<EOS>
Ay
ay
---
<EOS>
oh
yes
,
"
and
laughed
once
more
.
 
<EOS>
Then
something
passed
that
caught
his
fancy
,
and
the
topic
wandered
from
his
mind
,
and
was
succeeded
by
another
just
as
fleeting
.
  
<EOS>
But
it
was
plain
from
what
he
had
said
,
and
from
his
returning
to
the
point
more
than
once
that
day
,
and
on
the
next
,
that
the
blind
man
's
visit
,
and
indeed
his
words
,
had
taken
strong
possession
of
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
the
idea
of
wealth
had
occurred
to
him
for
the
first
time
on
looking
at
the
golden
clouds
that
evening
---
and
images
were
often
presented
to
his
thoughts
by
outward
objects
quite
as
remote
and
distant
;
or
whether
their
poor
and
humble
way
of
life
had
suggested
it
,
by
contrast
,
long
ago
;
or
whether
the
accident
(
as
he
would
deem
it
)
of
the
blind
man
's
pursuing
the
current
of
his
own
remarks
,
had
done
so
at
the
moment
;
or
he
had
been
impressed
by
the
mere
circumstance
of
the
man
being
blind
,
and
,
therefore
,
unlike
any
one
with
whom
he
had
talked
before
;
it
was
impossible
to
tell
.
 
<EOS>
She
tried
every
means
to
discover
,
but
in
vain
;
and
the
probability
is
that
Barnaby
himself
was
equally
in
the
dark
.
  
<EOS>
It
filled
her
with
uneasiness
to
find
him
harping
on
this
string
,
but
all
that
she
could
do
,
was
to
lead
him
quickly
to
some
other
subject
,
and
to
dismiss
it
from
his
brain
.
 
<EOS>
To
caution
him
against
their
visitor
,
to
show
any
fear
or
suspicion
in
reference
to
him
,
would
only
be
,
she
feared
,
to
increase
that
interest
with
which
Barnaby
regarded
him
,
and
to
strengthen
his
desire
to
meet
him
once
again
.
 
<EOS>
She
hoped
,
by
plunging
into
the
crowd
,
to
rid
herself
of
her
terrible
pursuer
,
and
then
,
by
journeying
to
a
distance
and
observing
increased
caution
,
if
that
were
possible
,
to
live
again
unknown
,
in
secrecy
and
peace
.
  
<EOS>
They
reached
,
in
course
of
time
,
their
halting
-
place
within
ten
miles
of
London
,
and
lay
there
for
the
night
,
after
bargaining
to
be
carried
on
for
a
trifle
next
day
,
in
a
light
van
which
was
returning
empty
,
and
was
to
start
at
five
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
The
driver
was
punctual
,
the
road
good
---
save
for
the
dust
,
the
weather
being
very
hot
and
dry
---
and
at
seven
in
the
forenoon
of
Friday
the
second
of
June
,
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
eighty
,
they
alighted
at
the
foot
of
Westminster
Bridge
,
bade
their
conductor
farewell
,
and
stood
alone
,
together
,
on
the
scorching
pavement
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
freshness
which
night
sheds
upon
such
busy
thoroughfares
had
already
departed
,
and
the
sun
was
shining
with
uncommon
lustre
.

Chapter
48
    
Uncertain
where
to
go
next
,
and
bewildered
by
the
crowd
of
people
who
were
already
astir
,
they
sat
down
in
one
of
the
recesses
on
the
bridge
,
to
rest
.
 
<EOS>
They
soon
became
aware
that
the
stream
of
life
was
all
pouring
one
way
,
and
that
a
vast
throng
of
persons
were
crossing
the
river
from
the
Middlesex
to
the
Surrey
shore
,
in
unusual
haste
and
evident
excitement
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
,
for
the
most
part
,
in
knots
of
two
or
three
,
or
sometimes
half
-
a
-
dozen
;
they
spoke
little
together
---
many
of
them
were
quite
silent
;
and
hurried
on
as
if
they
had
one
absorbing
object
in
view
,
which
was
common
to
them
all
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
surprised
to
see
that
nearly
every
man
in
this
great
concourse
,
which
still
came
pouring
past
,
without
slackening
in
the
least
,
wore
in
his
hat
a
blue
cockade
;
and
that
the
chance
passengers
who
were
not
so
decorated
,
appeared
timidly
anxious
to
escape
observation
or
attack
,
and
gave
them
the
wall
as
if
they
would
conciliate
them
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
was
natural
enough
,
considering
their
inferiority
in
point
of
numbers
;
for
the
proportion
of
those
who
wore
blue
cockades
,
to
those
who
were
dressed
as
usual
,
was
at
least
forty
or
fifty
to
one
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
quarrelling
,
however
:
the
blue
cockades
went
swarming
on
,
passing
each
other
when
they
could
,
and
making
all
the
speed
that
was
possible
in
such
a
multitude
;
and
exchanged
nothing
more
than
looks
,
and
very
often
not
even
those
,
with
such
of
the
passers
-
by
as
were
not
of
their
number
.
  
<EOS>
At
first
,
the
current
of
people
had
been
confined
to
the
two
pathways
,
and
but
a
few
more
eager
stragglers
kept
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
But
after
half
an
hour
or
so
,
the
passage
was
completely
blocked
up
by
the
great
press
,
which
,
being
now
closely
wedged
together
,
and
impeded
by
the
carts
and
coaches
it
encountered
,
moved
but
slowly
,
and
was
sometimes
at
a
stand
for
five
or
ten
minutes
together
.
  
<EOS>
After
the
lapse
of
nearly
two
hours
,
the
numbers
began
to
diminish
visibly
,
and
gradually
dwindling
away
,
by
little
and
little
,
left
the
bridge
quite
clear
,
save
that
,
now
and
then
,
some
hot
and
dusty
man
,
with
the
cockade
in
his
hat
,
and
his
coat
thrown
over
his
shoulder
,
went
panting
by
,
fearful
of
being
too
late
,
or
stopped
to
ask
which
way
his
friends
had
taken
,
and
being
directed
,
hastened
on
again
like
one
refreshed
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
comparative
solitude
,
which
seemed
quite
strange
and
novel
after
the
late
crowd
,
the
widow
had
for
the
first
time
an
opportunity
of
inquiring
of
an
old
man
who
came
and
sat
beside
them
,
what
was
the
meaning
of
that
great
assemblage
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
where
have
you
come
from
,
"
he
returned
,
"
that
you
have
n't
heard
of
Lord
George
Gordon
's
great
association
?
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
day
that
he
presents
the
petition
against
the
Catholics
,
God
bless
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
have
all
these
men
to
do
with
that
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
have
they
to
do
with
it
!
"
<EOS>
the
old
man
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
how
you
talk
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
know
his
lordship
has
declared
he
wo
n't
present
it
to
the
house
at
all
,
unless
it
is
attended
to
the
door
by
forty
thousand
good
and
true
men
at
least
?
 
<EOS>
There
's
a
crowd
for
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
crowd
indeed
!
"
said
Barnaby
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
hear
that
,
mother
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
they
're
mustering
yonder
,
as
I
am
told
,
"
resumed
the
old
man
,
"
nigh
upon
a
hundred
thousand
strong
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
Let
Lord
George
alone
.
<EOS>
He
knows
his
power
.
 
<EOS>
There
'll
be
a
good
many
faces
inside
them
three
windows
over
there
,
"
and
he
pointed
to
where
the
House
of
Commons
overlooked
the
river
,
"
that
'll
turn
pale
when
good
Lord
George
gets
up
this
afternoon
,
and
with
reason
too
!
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
ay
.
 
<EOS>
Let
his
lordship
alone
.
 
<EOS>
Let
him
alone
.
 
<EOS>
HE
knows
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
so
,
with
much
mumbling
and
chuckling
and
shaking
of
his
forefinger
,
he
rose
,
with
the
assistance
of
his
stick
,
and
tottered
off
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
!
"
said
Barnaby
,
"
that
's
a
brave
crowd
he
talks
of
.
 
<EOS>
Come
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
to
join
it
!
"
cried
his
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
"
he
answered
,
plucking
at
her
sleeve
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
 
<EOS>
Come
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
,
"
she
urged
,
"
what
mischief
they
may
do
,
where
they
may
lead
you
,
what
their
meaning
is
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
Barnaby
,
for
my
sake
---
<EOS>
"
  
"
For
your
sake
!
"
he
cried
,
patting
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
!
<EOS>
It
IS
for
your
sake
,
mother
.
 
<EOS>
You
remember
what
the
blind
man
said
,
about
the
gold
.
 
<EOS>
Here
's
a
brave
crowd
!
 
<EOS>
Come
!
 
<EOS>
Or
wait
till
I
come
back
---
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
,
wait
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
tried
with
all
the
earnestness
her
fears
engendered
,
to
turn
him
from
his
purpose
,
but
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
stooping
down
to
buckle
on
his
shoe
,
when
a
hackney
-
coach
passed
them
rather
quickly
,
and
a
voice
inside
called
to
the
driver
to
stop
.
  
<EOS>
"
Young
man
,
"
said
a
voice
within
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
's
that
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Barnaby
,
looking
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
wear
this
ornament
?
"
returned
the
stranger
,
holding
out
a
blue
cockade
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
Heaven
's
name
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
do
not
give
it
him
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
widow
.
  
<EOS>
"
Speak
for
yourself
,
woman
,
"
said
the
man
within
the
coach
,
coldly
.
"
<EOS>
Leave
the
young
man
to
his
choice
;
he
's
old
enough
to
make
it
,
and
to
snap
your
apron
-
strings
.
 
<EOS>
He
knows
,
without
your
telling
,
whether
he
wears
the
sign
of
a
loyal
Englishman
or
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
Barnaby
,
trembling
with
impatience
,
cried
,
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
,
I
do
,
"
as
he
had
cried
a
dozen
times
already
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
threw
him
a
cockade
,
and
crying
,
"
Make
haste
to
St
George
's
Fields
,
"
ordered
the
coachman
to
drive
on
fast
;
and
left
them
.
  
<EOS>
With
hands
that
trembled
with
his
eagerness
to
fix
the
bauble
in
his
hat
,
Barnaby
was
adjusting
it
as
he
best
could
,
and
hurriedly
replying
to
the
tears
and
entreaties
of
his
mother
,
when
two
gentlemen
passed
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
Observing
them
,
and
seeing
how
Barnaby
was
occupied
,
they
stopped
,
whispered
together
for
an
instant
,
turned
back
,
and
came
over
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
are
you
sitting
here
?
"
said
one
of
them
,
who
was
dressed
in
a
plain
suit
of
black
,
wore
long
lank
hair
,
and
carried
a
great
cane
.
<EOS>
"
Why
have
you
not
gone
with
the
rest
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
,
sir
,
"
replied
Barnaby
,
finishing
his
task
,
and
putting
his
hat
on
with
an
air
of
pride
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
there
directly
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Say
"
my
lord
,
"
young
man
,
when
his
lordship
does
you
the
honour
of
speaking
to
you
,
"
said
the
second
gentleman
mildly
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
n't
know
Lord
George
Gordon
when
you
see
him
,
it
's
high
time
you
should
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
Gashford
,
"
said
Lord
George
,
as
Barnaby
pulled
off
his
hat
again
and
made
him
a
low
bow
,
"
it
's
no
great
matter
on
a
day
like
this
,
which
every
Englishman
will
remember
with
delight
and
pride
.
<EOS>
Put
on
your
hat
,
friend
,
and
follow
us
,
for
you
lag
behind
and
are
late
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
past
ten
now
.
 
<EOS>
Did
n't
you
know
that
the
hour
for
assembling
was
ten
o'clock
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Barnaby
shook
his
head
and
looked
vacantly
from
one
to
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
might
have
known
it
,
friend
,
"
said
Gashford
,
"
it
was
perfectly
understood
.
 
<EOS>
How
came
you
to
be
so
ill
informed
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
can
not
tell
you
,
sir
,
"
the
widow
interposed
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
of
no
use
to
ask
him
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
but
this
morning
come
from
a
long
distance
in
the
country
,
and
know
nothing
of
these
matters
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
cause
has
taken
a
deep
root
,
and
has
spread
its
branches
far
and
wide
,
"
said
Lord
George
to
his
secretary
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
pleasant
hearing
.
 
<EOS>
I
thank
Heaven
for
it
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Amen
!
"
cried
Gashford
with
a
solemn
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
understand
me
,
my
lord
,
"
said
the
widow
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
,
but
you
cruelly
mistake
my
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
We
know
nothing
of
these
matters
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
no
desire
or
right
to
join
in
what
you
are
about
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
my
son
,
my
poor
afflicted
son
,
dearer
to
me
than
my
own
life
.
 
<EOS>
In
mercy
's
name
,
my
lord
,
go
your
way
alone
,
and
do
not
tempt
him
into
danger
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
good
woman
,
"
said
Gashford
,
"
how
can
you
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Dear
me
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
by
tempting
,
and
by
danger
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
think
his
lordship
is
a
roaring
lion
,
going
about
and
seeking
whom
he
may
devour
?
 
<EOS>
God
bless
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
my
lord
,
forgive
me
,
"
implored
the
widow
,
laying
both
her
hands
upon
his
breast
,
and
scarcely
knowing
what
she
did
,
or
said
,
in
the
earnestness
of
her
supplication
,
"
but
there
are
reasons
why
you
should
hear
my
earnest
,
mother
's
prayer
,
and
leave
my
son
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
do
!
 
<EOS>
He
is
not
in
his
right
senses
,
he
is
not
,
indeed
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
bad
sign
of
the
wickedness
of
these
times
,
"
said
Lord
George
,
evading
her
touch
,
and
colouring
deeply
,
"
that
those
who
cling
to
the
truth
and
support
the
right
cause
,
are
set
down
as
mad
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
the
heart
to
say
this
of
your
own
son
,
unnatural
mother
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
astonished
at
you
!
"
<EOS>
said
Gashford
,
with
a
kind
of
meek
severity
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
very
sad
picture
of
female
depravity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
surely
no
appearance
,
"
said
Lord
George
,
glancing
at
Barnaby
,
and
whispering
in
his
secretary
's
ear
,
"
of
being
deranged
?
<EOS>
And
even
if
he
had
,
we
must
not
construe
any
trifling
peculiarity
into
madness
.
 
<EOS>
Which
of
us
"
---
<EOS>
and
here
he
turned
red
again
---
"
would
be
safe
,
if
that
were
made
the
law
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
one
,
"
replied
the
secretary
;
"
in
that
case
,
the
greater
the
zeal
,
the
truth
,
and
talent
;
the
more
direct
the
call
from
above
;
the
clearer
would
be
the
madness
.
 
<EOS>
With
regard
to
this
young
man
,
my
lord
,
"
he
added
,
with
a
lip
that
slightly
curled
as
he
looked
at
Barnaby
,
who
stood
twirling
his
hat
,
and
stealthily
beckoning
them
to
come
away
,
"
he
is
as
sensible
and
self
-
possessed
as
any
one
I
ever
saw
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
desire
to
make
one
of
this
great
body
?
"
said
Lord
George
,
addressing
him
;
"
and
intended
to
make
one
,
did
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
---
yes
,
"
said
Barnaby
,
with
sparkling
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
I
did
!
<EOS>
I
told
her
so
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
,
"
replied
Lord
George
,
with
a
reproachful
glance
at
the
unhappy
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
so
.
 
<EOS>
Follow
me
and
this
gentleman
,
and
you
shall
have
your
wish
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Barnaby
kissed
his
mother
tenderly
on
the
cheek
,
and
bidding
her
be
of
good
cheer
,
for
their
fortunes
were
both
made
now
,
did
as
he
was
desired
.
 
<EOS>
She
,
poor
woman
,
followed
too
---
with
how
much
fear
and
grief
it
would
be
hard
to
tell
.
  
<EOS>
They
passed
quickly
through
the
Bridge
Road
,
where
the
shops
were
all
shut
up
(
for
the
passage
of
the
great
crowd
and
the
expectation
of
their
return
had
alarmed
the
tradesmen
for
their
goods
and
windows
)
,
and
where
,
in
the
upper
stories
,
all
the
inhabitants
were
congregated
,
looking
down
into
the
street
below
,
with
faces
variously
expressive
of
alarm
,
of
interest
,
expectancy
,
and
indignation
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
these
applauded
,
and
some
hissed
;
but
regardless
of
these
interruptions
---
for
the
noise
of
a
vast
congregation
of
people
at
a
little
distance
,
sounded
in
his
ears
like
the
roaring
of
the
sea
---
Lord
George
Gordon
quickened
his
pace
,
and
presently
arrived
before
St
George
's
Fields
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
really
fields
at
that
time
,
and
of
considerable
extent
.
<EOS>
Here
an
immense
multitude
was
collected
,
bearing
flags
of
various
kinds
and
sizes
,
but
all
of
the
same
colour
---
blue
,
like
the
cockades
---
some
sections
marching
to
and
fro
in
military
array
,
and
others
drawn
up
in
circles
,
squares
,
and
lines
.
 
<EOS>
A
large
portion
,
both
of
the
bodies
which
paraded
the
ground
,
and
of
those
which
remained
stationary
,
were
occupied
in
singing
hymns
or
psalms
.
<EOS>
With
whomsoever
this
originated
,
it
was
well
done
;
for
the
sound
of
so
many
thousand
voices
in
the
air
must
have
stirred
the
heart
of
any
man
within
him
,
and
could
not
fail
to
have
a
wonderful
effect
upon
enthusiasts
,
however
mistaken
.
  
<EOS>
Scouts
had
been
posted
in
advance
of
the
great
body
,
to
give
notice
of
their
leader
's
coming
.
 
<EOS>
These
falling
back
,
the
word
was
quickly
passed
through
the
whole
host
,
and
for
a
short
interval
there
ensued
a
profound
and
deathlike
silence
,
during
which
the
mass
was
so
still
and
quiet
,
that
the
fluttering
of
a
banner
caught
the
eye
,
and
became
a
circumstance
of
note
.
 
<EOS>
Then
they
burst
into
a
tremendous
shout
,
into
another
,
and
another
;
and
the
air
seemed
rent
and
shaken
,
as
if
by
the
discharge
of
cannon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gashford
!
"
cried
Lord
George
,
pressing
his
secretary
's
arm
tight
within
his
own
,
and
speaking
with
as
much
emotion
in
his
voice
,
as
in
his
altered
face
,
<EOS>
"
I
arn
called
indeed
,
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
and
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
the
leader
of
a
host
.
 
<EOS>
If
they
summoned
me
at
this
moment
with
one
voice
to
lead
them
on
to
death
,
I
'd
do
it
---
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
fall
first
myself
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
proud
sight
,
"
said
the
secretary
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
noble
day
for
England
,
and
for
the
great
cause
throughout
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
Such
homage
,
my
lord
,
as
I
,
an
humble
but
devoted
man
,
can
render
---
"
  
"
What
are
you
doing
?
"
<EOS>
cried
his
master
,
catching
him
by
both
hands
;
for
he
had
made
a
show
of
kneeling
at
his
feet
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
not
unfit
me
,
dear
Gashford
,
for
the
solemn
duty
of
this
glorious
day
---
"
the
tears
stood
in
the
eyes
of
the
poor
gentleman
as
he
said
the
words
.
<EOS>
---
"
Let
us
go
among
them
;
we
have
to
find
a
place
in
some
division
for
this
new
recruit
---
give
me
your
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Gashford
slid
his
cold
insidious
palm
into
his
master
's
grasp
,
and
so
,
hand
in
hand
,
and
followed
still
by
Barnaby
and
by
his
mother
too
,
they
mingled
with
the
concourse
.
  
<EOS>
They
had
by
this
time
taken
to
their
singing
again
,
and
as
their
leader
passed
between
their
ranks
,
they
raised
their
voices
to
their
utmost
.
 
<EOS>
Many
of
those
who
were
banded
together
to
support
the
religion
of
their
country
,
even
unto
death
,
had
never
heard
a
hymn
or
psalm
in
all
their
lives
.
 
<EOS>
But
these
fellows
having
for
the
most
part
strong
lungs
,
and
being
naturally
fond
of
singing
,
chanted
any
ribaldry
or
nonsense
that
occurred
to
them
,
feeling
pretty
certain
that
it
would
not
be
detected
in
the
general
chorus
,
and
not
caring
much
if
it
were
.
 
<EOS>
Many
of
these
voluntaries
were
sung
under
the
very
nose
of
Lord
George
Gordon
,
who
,
quite
unconscious
of
their
burden
,
passed
on
with
his
usual
stiff
and
solemn
deportment
,
very
much
edified
and
delighted
by
the
pious
conduct
of
his
followers
.
  
<EOS>
So
they
went
on
and
on
,
up
this
line
,
down
that
<EOS>
,
round
the
exterior
of
this
circle
,
and
on
every
side
of
that
hollow
square
;
and
still
there
were
lines
,
and
squares
,
and
circles
out
of
number
to
review
.
<EOS>
The
day
being
now
intensely
hot
,
and
the
sun
striking
down
his
fiercest
rays
upon
the
field
,
those
who
carried
heavy
banners
began
to
grow
faint
and
weary
;
most
of
the
number
assembled
were
fain
to
pull
off
their
neckcloths
,
and
throw
their
coats
and
waistcoats
open
;
and
some
,
towards
the
centre
,
quite
overpowered
by
the
excessive
heat
,
which
was
of
course
rendered
more
unendurable
by
the
multitude
around
them
,
lay
down
upon
the
grass
,
and
offered
all
they
had
about
them
for
a
drink
of
water
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
no
man
left
the
ground
,
not
even
of
those
who
were
so
distressed
;
still
Lord
George
,
streaming
from
every
pore
,
went
on
with
Gashford
;
and
still
Barnaby
and
his
mother
followed
close
behind
them
.
  
<EOS>
They
had
arrived
at
the
top
of
a
long
line
of
some
eight
hundred
men
in
single
file
,
and
Lord
George
had
turned
his
head
to
look
back
,
when
a
loud
cry
of
recognition
---
in
that
peculiar
and
half
-
stifled
tone
which
a
voice
has
,
when
it
is
raised
in
the
open
air
and
in
the
midst
of
a
great
concourse
of
persons
---
was
heard
,
and
a
man
stepped
with
a
shout
of
laughter
from
the
rank
,
and
smote
Barnaby
on
the
shoulders
with
his
heavy
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
now
!
"
he
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
Barnaby
Rudge
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
where
have
you
been
hiding
for
these
hundred
years
?
<EOS>
"
  
Barnaby
had
been
thinking
within
himself
that
the
smell
of
the
trodden
grass
brought
back
his
old
days
at
cricket
,
when
he
was
a
young
boy
and
played
on
Chigwell
Green
.
 
<EOS>
Confused
by
this
sudden
and
boisterous
address
,
he
stared
in
a
bewildered
manner
at
the
man
,
and
could
scarcely
say
"
What
!
<EOS>
Hugh
!
<EOS>
"
  
"
Hugh
!
"
echoed
the
other
;
"
ay
,
Hugh
---
Maypole
Hugh
!
 
<EOS>
You
remember
my
dog
?
 
<EOS>
He
's
alive
now
,
and
will
know
you
,
I
warrant
.
 
<EOS>
What
,
you
wear
the
colour
,
do
you
?
 
<EOS>
Well
done
!
 
<EOS>
Ha
ha
ha
!
"
  
"
You
know
this
young
man
,
I
see
,
"
said
Lord
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
Know
him
,
my
lord
!
<EOS>
as
well
as
I
know
my
own
right
hand
.
 
<EOS>
My
captain
knows
him
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
know
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
take
him
into
your
division
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
has
n't
in
it
<EOS>
a
better
,
nor
a
nimbler
,
nor
a
more
active
man
,
than
Barnaby
Rudge
,
"
said
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Show
me
the
man
who
says
it
has
!
<EOS>
Fall
in
,
Barnaby
.
 
<EOS>
He
shall
march
,
my
lord
,
between
me
and
Dennis
;
and
he
shall
carry
,
"
he
added
,
taking
a
flag
from
the
hand
of
a
tired
man
who
tendered
it
,
"
the
gayest
silken
streamer
in
this
valiant
army
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
name
of
God
,
no
!
"
shrieked
the
widow
,
darting
forward
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Barnaby
---
my
lord
---
see
---
he
'll
come
back
---
Barnaby
---
Barnaby
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Women
in
the
field
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Hugh
,
stepping
between
them
,
and
holding
her
off
.
 
<EOS>
"
Holloa
!
 
<EOS>
My
captain
there
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
here
?
"
cried
Simon
Tappertit
,
bustling
up
in
a
great
heat
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
call
this
order
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
like
it
,
captain
,
"
answered
Hugh
,
still
holding
her
back
with
his
outstretched
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
against
all
orders
.
 
<EOS>
Ladies
are
carrying
off
our
gallant
soldiers
from
their
duty
.
 
<EOS>
The
word
of
command
,
captain
!
 
<EOS>
They
're
filing
off
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
Quick
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Close
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Simon
,
with
the
whole
power
of
his
lungs
.
 
<EOS>
"
Form
!
March
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
thrown
to
the
ground
;
the
whole
field
was
in
motion
;
Barnaby
was
whirled
away
into
the
heart
of
a
dense
mass
of
men
,
and
she
saw
him
no
more
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
49
    
<EOS>
The
mob
had
been
divided
from
its
first
assemblage
into
four
divisions
;
the
London
,
the
Westminster
,
the
Southwark
,
and
the
Scotch
.
 
<EOS>
Each
of
these
divisions
being
subdivided
into
various
bodies
,
and
these
bodies
being
drawn
up
in
various
forms
and
figures
,
the
general
arrangement
was
,
except
to
the
few
chiefs
and
leaders
,
as
unintelligible
as
the
plan
of
a
great
battle
to
the
meanest
soldier
in
the
field
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
without
its
method
,
however
;
for
,
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
after
being
put
in
motion
,
the
crowd
had
resolved
itself
into
three
great
parties
,
and
were
prepared
,
as
had
been
arranged
,
to
cross
the
river
by
different
bridges
,
and
make
for
the
House
of
Commons
in
separate
detachments
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
head
of
that
division
which
had
Westminster
Bridge
for
its
approach
to
the
scene
of
action
,
Lord
George
Gordon
took
his
post
;
with
Gashford
at
his
right
hand
,
and
sundry
ruffians
,
of
most
unpromising
appearance
,
forming
a
kind
of
staff
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
conduct
of
a
second
party
,
whose
route
lay
by
Blackfriars
,
was
entrusted
to
a
committee
of
management
,
including
perhaps
a
dozen
men
:
while
the
third
,
which
was
to
go
by
London
Bridge
,
and
through
the
main
streets
,
in
order
that
their
numbers
and
their
serious
intentions
might
be
the
better
known
and
appreciated
by
the
citizens
,
were
led
by
Simon
Tappertit
(
assisted
by
a
few
subalterns
,
selected
from
the
Brotherhood
of
United
Bulldogs
)
,
Dennis
<EOS>
the
hangman
,
Hugh
,
and
some
others
.
  
<EOS>
The
word
of
command
being
given
,
each
of
these
great
bodies
took
the
road
assigned
to
it
,
and
departed
on
its
way
,
in
perfect
order
and
profound
silence
.
 
<EOS>
That
which
went
through
the
City
greatly
exceeded
the
others
in
number
,
and
was
of
such
prodigious
extent
that
when
the
rear
began
to
move
,
the
front
was
nearly
four
miles
in
advance
,
notwithstanding
that
the
men
marched
three
abreast
and
followed
very
close
upon
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
head
of
this
party
,
in
the
place
where
Hugh
,
in
the
madness
of
his
humour
,
had
stationed
him
,
and
walking
between
that
dangerous
companion
and
the
hangman
,
went
Barnaby
;
as
many
a
man
among
the
thousands
who
looked
on
that
day
afterwards
remembered
well
.
 
<EOS>
Forgetful
of
all
other
things
in
the
ecstasy
of
the
moment
,
his
face
flushed
and
his
eyes
sparkling
with
delight
,
heedless
of
the
weight
of
the
great
banner
he
carried
,
and
mindful
only
of
its
flashing
in
the
sun
and
rustling
in
the
summer
breeze
,
on
he
went
,
proud
,
happy
,
elated
past
all
telling
:
---
the
only
light
-
hearted
,
undesigning
creature
,
in
the
whole
assembly
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
of
this
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Hugh
,
as
they
passed
through
the
crowded
streets
,
and
looked
up
at
the
windows
which
were
thronged
with
spectators
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
have
all
turned
out
to
see
our
flags
and
streamers
?
 
<EOS>
Eh
,
Barnaby
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
Barnaby
's
the
greatest
man
of
all
the
pack
!
 
<EOS>
His
flag
's
the
largest
of
the
lot
,
the
brightest
too
.
<EOS>
There
's
nothing
in
the
show
,
like
Barnaby
.
 
<EOS>
All
eyes
are
turned
on
him
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
ha
ha
!
"
  
"
Do
n't
make
that
din
,
brother
,
"
growled
the
hangman
,
glancing
with
no
very
approving
eyes
at
Barnaby
as
he
spoke
:
"
<EOS>
I
hope
he
do
n't
think
there
's
nothing
to
be
done
,
but
carrying
that
there
piece
of
blue
rag
,
like
a
boy
at
a
breaking
up
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
ready
for
action
<EOS>
I
hope
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
You
,
I
mean
,
"
he
added
,
nudging
Barnaby
roughly
with
his
elbow
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
staring
at
?
 
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
you
speak
?
<EOS>
"
  
Barnaby
had
been
gazing
at
his
flag
,
and
looked
vacantly
from
his
questioner
to
Hugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
do
n't
understand
your
way
,
"
said
the
latter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
,
I
'll
explain
it
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Barnaby
old
boy
,
attend
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
attend
,
"
said
Barnaby
,
looking
anxiously
round
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
wish
I
could
see
her
somewhere
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
See
who
?
"
demanded
Dennis
in
a
gruff
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
an't
in
love
<EOS>
I
hope
,
brother
?
 
<EOS>
That
an't
the
sort
of
thing
for
us
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
n't
have
no
love
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
would
be
proud
indeed
to
see
me
now
,
eh
Hugh
?
"
said
Barnaby
.
<EOS>
"
Would
n't
it
make
her
glad
to
see
me
at
the
head
of
this
large
show
?
 
<EOS>
She
'd
cry
for
joy
<EOS>
,
I
know
she
would
.
 
<EOS>
Where
CAN
she
be
?
 
<EOS>
She
never
sees
me
at
my
best
,
and
what
do
I
care
to
be
gay
and
fine
if
SHE
'S
not
by
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
palaver
's
this
?
"
asked
Mr
Dennis
with
supreme
disdain
.
<EOS>
"
We
an't
got
no
sentimental
members
among
us
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
be
uneasy
,
brother
,
"
cried
Hugh
,
"
he
's
only
talking
of
his
mother
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Of
his
what
?
"
said
Mr
Dennis
with
a
strong
oath
.
  
<EOS>
"
His
mother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
have
I
combined
myself
with
this
here
section
,
and
turned
out
on
this
here
memorable
day
,
to
hear
men
talk
about
their
mothers
!
"
<EOS>
growled
Mr
Dennis
with
extreme
disgust
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
notion
of
a
man
's
sweetheart
's
bad
enough
,
but
a
man
's
mother
!
"
<EOS>
---
and
here
his
disgust
was
so
extreme
that
he
spat
upon
the
ground
,
and
could
say
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
Barnaby
's
right
,
"
cried
Hugh
with
a
grin
,
"
and
I
say
it
.
 
<EOS>
Lookee
,
bold
lad
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
's
not
here
to
see
,
it
's
because
I
've
provided
for
her
,
and
sent
half
-
a
-
dozen
gentlemen
,
every
one
of
'em
with
a
blue
flag
(
but
not
half
as
fine
as
yours
)
,
to
take
her
,
in
state
,
to
a
grand
house
all
hung
round
with
gold
and
silver
banners
,
and
everything
else
you
please
,
where
she
'll
wait
till
you
come
,
and
want
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
"
said
Barnaby
,
his
face
beaming
with
delight
:
"
have
you
indeed
?
 
<EOS>
That
's
a
good
hearing
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
fine
!
 
<EOS>
Kind
Hugh
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
nothing
to
what
will
come
,
bless
you
,
"
retorted
Hugh
,
with
a
wink
at
Dennis
,
who
regarded
his
new
companion
in
arms
with
great
astonishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
?
"
cried
Barnaby
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
at
all
,
"
said
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Money
,
cocked
hats
and
feathers
,
red
coats
and
gold
lace
;
all
the
fine
things
there
are
,
ever
were
,
or
will
be
;
will
belong
to
us
if
we
are
true
to
that
noble
gentleman
---
 
the
best
man
in
the
world
---
carry
our
flags
for
a
few
days
,
and
keep
'em
safe
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
all
we
've
got
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
all
?
"
cried
Barnaby
with
glistening
eyes
,
as
he
clutched
his
pole
the
tighter
;
"
I
warrant
you
<EOS>
I
keep
this
one
safe
,
then
.
<EOS>
You
have
put
it
in
good
hands
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
me
,
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
shall
wrest
this
flag
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
said
!
"
cried
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
ha
!
 
<EOS>
Nobly
said
!
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
old
stout
Barnaby
,
that
I
have
climbed
and
leaped
with
,
many
and
many
a
day
<EOS>
---
I
knew
I
was
not
mistaken
in
Barnaby
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
see
,
man
,
"
he
added
in
a
whisper
,
as
he
slipped
to
the
other
side
of
Dennis
,
"
that
the
lad
's
a
natural
,
and
can
be
got
to
do
anything
,
if
you
take
him
the
right
way
?
 
<EOS>
Letting
alone
<EOS>
the
fun
<EOS>
he
is
,
he
's
worth
a
dozen
men
,
in
earnest
,
as
you
'd
find
if
you
tried
a
fall
with
him
.
<EOS>
Leave
him
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
soon
see
whether
he
's
of
use
or
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dennis
received
these
explanatory
remarks
with
many
nods
and
winks
,
and
softened
his
behaviour
towards
Barnaby
from
that
moment
.
<EOS>
Hugh
,
laying
his
finger
on
his
nose
,
stepped
back
into
his
former
place
,
and
they
proceeded
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
between
two
and
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
when
the
three
great
parties
met
at
Westminster
,
and
,
uniting
into
one
huge
mass
,
raised
a
tremendous
shout
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
not
only
done
in
token
of
their
presence
,
but
as
a
signal
to
those
on
whom
the
task
devolved
,
that
it
was
time
to
take
possession
of
the
lobbies
of
both
Houses
,
and
of
the
various
avenues
of
approach
,
and
of
the
gallery
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
To
the
last
-
named
place
,
Hugh
and
Dennis
,
still
with
their
pupil
between
them
,
rushed
straightway
;
Barnaby
having
given
his
flag
into
the
hands
of
one
of
their
own
party
,
who
kept
them
at
the
outer
door
.
 
<EOS>
Their
followers
pressing
on
behind
,
they
were
borne
as
on
a
great
wave
to
the
very
doors
of
the
gallery
,
whence
it
was
impossible
to
retreat
,
even
if
they
had
been
so
inclined
,
by
reason
of
the
throng
which
choked
up
the
passages
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
familiar
expression
in
describing
a
great
crowd
,
that
a
person
might
have
walked
upon
the
people
's
heads
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
case
it
was
actually
done
;
for
a
boy
who
had
by
some
means
got
among
the
concourse
,
and
was
in
imminent
danger
of
suffocation
,
climbed
to
the
shoulders
of
a
man
beside
him
and
walked
upon
the
people
's
hats
and
heads
into
the
open
street
;
traversing
in
his
passage
the
whole
length
of
two
staircases
and
a
long
gallery
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
the
swarm
without
less
dense
;
for
a
basket
which
had
been
tossed
into
the
crowd
,
was
jerked
from
head
to
head
,
and
shoulder
to
shoulder
,
and
went
spinning
and
whirling
on
above
them
,
until
it
was
lost
to
view
,
without
ever
once
falling
in
among
them
or
coming
near
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
Through
this
vast
throng
,
sprinkled
doubtless
here
and
there
with
honest
zealots
,
but
composed
for
the
most
part
of
the
very
scum
and
refuse
of
London
,
whose
growth
was
fostered
by
bad
criminal
laws
,
bad
prison
regulations
,
and
the
worst
conceivable
police
,
such
of
the
members
of
both
Houses
of
Parliament
as
had
not
taken
the
precaution
to
be
already
at
their
posts
,
were
compelled
to
fight
and
force
their
way
.
 
<EOS>
Their
carriages
were
stopped
and
broken
;
the
wheels
wrenched
off
;
the
glasses
shivered
to
atoms
;
the
panels
beaten
in
;
drivers
,
footmen
,
and
masters
,
pulled
from
their
seats
and
rolled
in
the
mud
.
 
<EOS>
Lords
,
commoners
,
and
reverend
bishops
,
with
little
distinction
of
person
or
party
,
were
kicked
and
pinched
and
hustled
;
passed
from
hand
to
hand
through
various
stages
of
ill
-
usage
;
and
sent
to
their
fellow
-
senators
at
last
with
their
clothes
hanging
in
ribands
about
them
,
their
bagwigs
torn
off
,
themselves
speechless
and
breathless
,
and
their
persons
covered
with
the
powder
which
had
been
cuffed
and
beaten
out
of
their
hair
.
<EOS>
One
lord
was
so
long
in
the
hands
of
the
populace
,
that
the
Peers
as
a
body
resolved
to
sally
forth
and
rescue
him
,
and
were
in
the
act
of
doing
so
,
when
he
happily
appeared
among
them
covered
with
dirt
and
bruises
,
and
hardly
to
be
recognised
by
those
who
knew
him
best
.
 
<EOS>
The
noise
and
uproar
were
on
the
increase
every
moment
.
 
<EOS>
The
air
was
filled
with
execrations
,
hoots
,
and
howlings
.
 
<EOS>
The
mob
raged
and
roared
,
like
a
mad
monster
as
it
was
,
unceasingly
,
and
each
new
outrage
served
to
swell
its
fury
.
  
<EOS>
Within
doors
,
matters
were
even
yet
more
threatening
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
George
---
 
preceded
by
a
man
who
carried
the
immense
petition
on
a
porter
's
knot
through
the
lobby
to
the
door
of
the
House
of
Commons
,
where
it
was
received
by
two
officers
of
the
house
who
rolled
it
up
to
the
table
ready
for
presentation
---
had
taken
his
seat
at
an
early
hour
,
before
the
Speaker
went
to
prayers
.
 
<EOS>
His
followers
pouring
in
at
the
same
time
,
the
lobby
and
all
the
avenues
were
immediately
filled
,
as
we
have
seen
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
the
members
were
not
only
attacked
in
their
passage
through
the
streets
,
but
were
set
upon
within
the
very
walls
of
Parliament
;
while
the
tumult
,
both
within
and
without
,
was
so
great
,
that
those
who
attempted
to
speak
could
scarcely
hear
their
own
voices
:
far
less
,
consult
upon
the
course
it
would
be
wise
to
take
in
such
extremity
,
or
animate
each
other
to
dignified
and
firm
resistance
.
 
<EOS>
So
sure
as
any
member
,
just
arrived
,
with
dress
disordered
and
dishevelled
hair
,
came
struggling
through
the
crowd
in
the
lobby
,
it
yelled
and
screamed
in
triumph
;
and
when
the
door
of
the
House
,
partially
and
cautiously
opened
by
those
within
for
his
admission
,
gave
them
a
momentary
glimpse
of
the
interior
,
they
grew
more
wild
and
savage
,
like
beasts
at
the
sight
of
prey
,
and
made
a
rush
against
the
portal
which
strained
its
locks
and
bolts
in
their
staples
,
and
shook
the
very
beams
.
  
<EOS>
The
strangers
'
gallery
,
which
was
immediately
above
the
door
of
the
House
,
had
been
ordered
to
be
closed
on
the
first
rumour
of
disturbance
,
and
was
empty
;
save
that
now
<EOS>
and
then
Lord
George
took
his
seat
there
,
for
the
convenience
of
coming
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
which
led
to
it
,
and
repeating
to
the
people
what
had
passed
within
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
on
these
stairs
that
Barnaby
,
Hugh
,
and
Dennis
were
posted
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
two
flights
,
short
,
steep
,
and
narrow
,
running
parallel
to
each
other
,
and
leading
to
two
little
doors
communicating
with
a
low
passage
which
opened
on
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
Between
them
was
a
kind
of
well
,
or
unglazed
skylight
,
for
the
admission
of
light
and
air
into
the
lobby
,
which
might
be
some
eighteen
or
twenty
feet
below
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
one
of
these
little
staircases
---
not
that
at
the
head
of
which
Lord
George
appeared
from
time
to
time
,
but
the
other
---
Gashford
stood
with
his
elbow
on
the
bannister
,
and
his
cheek
resting
on
his
hand
,
with
his
usual
crafty
aspect
.
 
<EOS>
Whenever
he
varied
this
attitude
in
the
slightest
degree
---
so
much
as
by
the
gentlest
motion
of
his
arm
---
the
uproar
was
certain
to
increase
,
not
merely
there
,
but
in
the
lobby
below
;
from
which
place
no
doubt
,
some
man
who
acted
as
fugleman
to
the
rest
,
was
constantly
looking
up
and
watching
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Order
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Hugh
,
in
a
voice
which
made
itself
heard
even
above
the
roar
and
tumult
,
as
Lord
George
appeared
at
the
top
of
the
staircase
.
 
<EOS>
"
News
!
 
<EOS>
News
from
my
lord
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
noise
continued
,
notwithstanding
his
appearance
,
until
Gashford
looked
round
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
silence
immediately
---
even
among
the
people
in
the
passages
without
,
and
on
the
other
staircases
,
who
could
neither
see
nor
hear
,
but
to
whom
,
notwithstanding
,
the
signal
was
conveyed
with
marvellous
rapidity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
"
said
Lord
George
,
who
was
very
pale
and
agitated
,
we
must
be
firm
.
 
<EOS>
They
talk
of
delays
,
but
we
must
have
no
delays
.
<EOS>
They
talk
of
taking
your
petition
into
consideration
next
Tuesday
,
but
we
must
have
it
considered
now
.
 
<EOS>
Present
appearances
look
bad
for
our
success
,
but
we
must
succeed
and
will
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
succeed
and
will
!
"
echoed
the
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
among
their
shouts
and
cheers
and
other
cries
,
he
bowed
to
them
and
retired
,
and
presently
came
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
another
gesture
from
Gashford
,
and
a
dead
silence
directly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
,
"
he
said
,
this
time
,
"
that
we
have
little
reason
,
gentlemen
,
to
hope
for
any
redress
from
the
proceedings
of
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
must
redress
our
own
grievances
<EOS>
,
we
must
meet
again
,
we
must
put
our
trust
in
Providence
,
and
it
will
bless
our
endeavours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
speech
being
a
little
more
temperate
than
the
last
,
was
not
so
favourably
received
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
noise
and
exasperation
were
at
their
height
,
he
came
back
once
more
,
and
told
them
that
the
alarm
had
gone
forth
for
many
miles
round
;
that
when
the
King
heard
of
their
assembling
together
in
that
great
body
,
he
had
no
doubt
,
His
Majesty
would
send
down
private
orders
to
have
their
wishes
complied
with
;
and
---
with
the
manner
of
his
speech
as
childish
,
irresolute
,
and
uncertain
as
his
matter
---
was
proceeding
in
this
strain
,
when
two
gentlemen
suddenly
appeared
at
the
door
where
he
stood
,
and
pressing
past
him
and
coming
a
step
or
two
lower
down
upon
the
stairs
,
confronted
the
people
.
  
<EOS>
The
boldness
of
this
action
quite
took
them
by
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
not
the
less
disconcerted
,
<EOS>
when
one
of
the
gentlemen
,
turning
to
Lord
George
,
spoke
thus
---
in
a
loud
voice
that
they
might
hear
him
well
,
but
quite
coolly
and
collectedly
:
  
"
You
may
tell
these
people
,
if
you
please
,
my
lord
,
that
I
am
General
Conway
of
whom
they
have
heard
;
and
that
I
oppose
this
petition
,
and
all
their
proceedings
,
and
yours
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
a
soldier
,
you
may
tell
them
,
and
I
will
protect
the
freedom
of
this
place
with
my
sword
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
,
my
lord
,
that
the
members
of
this
House
are
all
in
arms
to
-
day
;
you
know
that
the
entrance
to
it
is
a
narrow
one
;
you
can
not
be
ignorant
that
there
are
men
within
these
walls
who
are
determined
to
defend
that
pass
to
the
last
,
and
<EOS>
before
whom
many
lives
must
fall
if
your
adherents
persevere
.
 
<EOS>
Have
a
care
what
you
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
my
Lord
George
,
"
said
the
other
gentleman
,
addressing
him
in
like
manner
,
"
I
desire
them
to
hear
this
,
from
me
---
<EOS>
Colonel
Gordon
---
 
your
near
relation
.
 
<EOS>
If
a
man
among
this
crowd
,
whose
uproar
strikes
us
deaf
,
crosses
the
threshold
of
the
House
of
Commons
,
I
swear
to
run
my
sword
that
moment
---
not
into
his
,
but
into
your
body
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
,
they
stepped
back
again
,
keeping
their
faces
towards
the
crowd
;
took
each
an
arm
of
the
misguided
nobleman
;
drew
him
into
the
passage
,
and
shut
the
door
;
which
they
directly
locked
and
fastened
on
the
inside
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
so
quickly
done
,
and
the
demeanour
of
both
gentlemen
---
who
were
not
young
men
either
---
was
so
gallant
and
resolute
,
that
the
crowd
faltered
and
stared
at
each
other
with
irresolute
and
timid
looks
.
 
<EOS>
Many
tried
to
turn
towards
the
door
;
some
of
the
faintest
-
hearted
cried
they
had
best
go
back
,
and
called
to
those
behind
to
give
way
;
and
the
panic
and
confusion
were
increasing
rapidly
,
when
Gashford
whispered
Hugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
now
!
"
<EOS>
Hugh
roared
aloud
,
turning
towards
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
go
back
?
<EOS>
Where
can
you
do
better
than
here
,
boys
!
 
<EOS>
One
good
rush
against
these
doors
and
one
below
at
the
same
time
,
will
do
the
business
.
<EOS>
Rush
on
,
then
!
 
<EOS>
As
to
the
door
below
,
let
those
stand
back
who
are
afraid
.
 
<EOS>
Let
those
who
are
not
afraid
,
try
who
shall
be
the
first
to
pass
it
.
 
<EOS>
Here
goes
!
 
<EOS>
Look
out
down
there
!
"
  
<EOS>
Without
the
delay
of
an
instant
,
he
threw
himself
headlong
over
the
bannisters
into
the
lobby
below
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
hardly
touched
the
ground
when
Barnaby
was
at
his
side
.
 
<EOS>
The
chaplain
's
assistant
,
and
some
members
who
were
imploring
the
people
to
retire
,
immediately
withdrew
;
and
then
,
with
a
great
shout
,
both
crowds
threw
themselves
against
the
doors
pell
-
mell
,
and
besieged
the
House
in
earnest
.
  
<EOS>
At
that
moment
,
when
a
second
onset
must
have
brought
them
into
collision
with
those
who
stood
on
the
defensive
within
,
in
which
case
great
loss
of
life
and
bloodshed
would
inevitably
have
ensued
,
---
the
hindmost
portion
of
the
crowd
gave
way
,
and
the
rumour
spread
from
mouth
to
mouth
that
a
messenger
had
been
despatched
by
water
for
the
military
,
who
were
forming
in
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
Fearful
of
sustaining
a
charge
in
the
narrow
passages
in
which
they
were
so
closely
wedged
together
,
the
throng
poured
out
as
impetuously
as
they
had
flocked
in
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
whole
stream
turned
at
once
,
Barnaby
and
Hugh
went
with
it
:
and
<EOS>
so
,
fighting
and
struggling
and
trampling
on
fallen
men
and
being
trampled
on
in
turn
themselves
,
they
and
the
whole
mass
floated
by
degrees
into
the
open
street
,
where
a
large
detachment
of
the
Guards
,
both
horse
and
foot
,
came
hurrying
up
;
clearing
the
ground
before
them
so
rapidly
that
the
people
seemed
to
melt
away
as
they
advanced
.
  
<EOS>
The
word
of
command
to
halt
being
given
,
the
soldiers
formed
across
the
street
;
the
rioters
,
breathless
and
exhausted
with
their
late
exertions
,
formed
likewise
,
though
in
a
very
irregular
and
disorderly
manner
.
 
<EOS>
The
commanding
officer
rode
hastily
into
the
open
space
between
the
two
bodies
,
accompanied
by
a
magistrate
and
an
officer
of
the
House
of
Commons
,
for
whose
accommodation
a
couple
of
troopers
had
hastily
dismounted
.
 
<EOS>
The
Riot
Act
was
read
,
but
not
a
man
stirred
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
first
rank
of
the
insurgents
,
Barnaby
and
Hugh
stood
side
by
side
.
 
<EOS>
Somebody
had
thrust
into
Barnaby
's
hands
when
he
came
out
into
the
street
,
his
precious
flag
;
which
,
being
now
rolled
up
and
tied
round
the
pole
,
looked
like
a
giant
quarter
-
staff
as
he
grasped
it
firmly
and
stood
upon
his
guard
.
 
<EOS>
If
ever
man
believed
with
his
whole
heart
and
soul
that
he
was
engaged
in
a
just
cause
,
and
that
he
was
bound
to
stand
by
his
leader
to
the
last
,
poor
Barnaby
believed
it
of
himself
and
Lord
George
Gordon
.
  
<EOS>
After
an
ineffectual
attempt
to
make
himself
heard
,
the
magistrate
gave
the
word
and
the
Horse
Guards
came
riding
in
among
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
But
,
even
then
,
he
galloped
here
and
there
,
exhorting
the
people
to
disperse
;
and
,
although
heavy
stones
were
thrown
at
the
men
,
and
some
were
desperately
cut
and
bruised
,
they
had
no
orders
but
to
make
prisoners
of
such
of
the
rioters
as
were
the
most
active
,
and
to
drive
the
people
back
with
the
flat
of
their
sabres
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
horses
came
in
among
them
,
the
throng
gave
way
at
many
points
,
and
the
Guards
,
following
up
their
advantage
,
were
rapidly
clearing
the
ground
,
when
two
or
three
of
the
foremost
,
who
were
in
a
manner
cut
off
from
the
rest
by
the
people
closing
round
them
,
made
straight
towards
Barnaby
and
Hugh
,
who
had
no
doubt
been
pointed
out
as
the
two
men
who
dropped
into
the
lobby
:
laying
about
them
now
with
some
effect
,
and
inflicting
on
the
more
turbulent
of
their
opponents
,
a
few
slight
flesh
wounds
,
under
the
influence
of
which
a
man
dropped
,
here
and
there
,
into
the
arms
of
his
fellows
,
amid
much
groaning
and
confusion
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
sight
of
gashed
and
bloody
faces
,
seen
for
a
moment
in
the
crowd
,
then
hidden
by
the
press
around
them
,
Barnaby
turned
pale
and
sick
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
stood
his
ground
,
and
grasping
his
pole
more
firmly
yet
,
kept
his
eye
fixed
upon
the
nearest
soldier
---
nodding
his
head
meanwhile
,
as
Hugh
,
with
a
scowling
visage
,
whispered
in
his
ear
.
  
<EOS>
The
soldier
came
spurring
on
,
making
his
horse
rear
as
the
people
pressed
about
him
,
cutting
at
the
hands
of
those
who
would
have
grasped
his
rein
and
forced
his
charger
back
,
and
waving
to
his
comrades
to
follow
---
and
still
Barnaby
,
without
retreating
an
inch
,
waited
for
his
coming
.
 
<EOS>
Some
called
to
him
to
fly
,
and
some
were
in
the
very
act
of
closing
round
him
,
to
prevent
his
being
taken
,
when
the
pole
swept
into
the
air
above
the
people
's
heads
,
and
the
man
's
saddle
was
empty
in
an
instant
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
he
and
Hugh
turned
and
fled
,
the
crowd
opening
to
let
them
pass
,
and
closing
up
again
so
quickly
that
there
was
no
clue
to
the
course
they
had
taken
.
 
<EOS>
Panting
for
breath
,
hot
,
dusty
,
and
exhausted
with
fatigue
,
they
reached
the
riverside
in
safety
,
and
getting
into
a
boat
with
all
despatch
were
soon
out
of
any
immediate
danger
.
  
<EOS>
As
they
glided
down
the
river
,
they
plainly
heard
the
people
cheering
;
and
supposing
they
might
have
forced
the
soldiers
to
retreat
,
lay
upon
their
oars
for
a
few
minutes
,
uncertain
whether
to
return
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
crowd
passing
along
Westminster
Bridge
,
soon
assured
them
that
the
populace
were
dispersing
;
and
Hugh
rightly
guessed
from
this
,
that
they
had
cheered
the
magistrate
for
offering
to
dismiss
the
military
on
condition
of
their
immediate
departure
to
their
several
homes
,
and
that
he
and
Barnaby
were
better
where
they
were
.
 
<EOS>
He
advised
,
therefore
,
that
they
should
proceed
to
Blackfriars
,
and
,
going
ashore
at
the
bridge
,
make
the
best
of
their
way
to
The
Boot
;
where
there
was
not
only
good
entertainment
and
safe
lodging
,
but
where
they
would
certainly
be
joined
by
many
of
their
late
companions
.
 
<EOS>
Barnaby
assenting
<EOS>
,
they
decided
on
this
course
of
action
,
and
pulled
for
Blackfriars
accordingly
.
  
<EOS>
They
landed
at
a
critical
time
,
and
fortunately
for
themselves
at
the
right
moment
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
coming
into
Fleet
Street
,
they
found
it
in
an
unusual
stir
;
and
inquiring
the
cause
,
were
told
that
a
body
of
Horse
Guards
had
just
galloped
past
,
and
that
they
were
escorting
some
rioters
whom
they
had
made
prisoners
,
to
Newgate
for
safety
.
<EOS>
Not
at
all
ill
-
pleased
to
have
so
narrowly
escaped
the
cavalcade
<EOS>
,
they
lost
no
more
time
in
asking
questions
,
but
hurried
to
The
Boot
with
as
much
speed
as
Hugh
considered
it
prudent
to
make
,
without
appearing
singular
or
attracting
an
inconvenient
share
of
public
notice
.

Chapter
50
    
<EOS>
They
were
among
the
first
to
reach
the
tavern
,
but
they
had
not
been
there
many
minutes
,
when
several
groups
of
men
who
had
formed
part
of
the
crowd
,
came
straggling
in
.
 
<EOS>
Among
them
were
Simon
Tappertit
and
Mr
Dennis
;
both
of
whom
,
but
especially
the
latter
,
greeted
Barnaby
with
the
utmost
warmth
,
and
paid
him
many
compliments
on
the
prowess
he
had
shown
.
  
<EOS>
"
Which
,
"
said
Dennis
,
with
an
oath
,
as
he
rested
his
bludgeon
in
a
corner
with
his
hat
upon
it
,
and
took
his
seat
at
the
same
table
with
them
,
"
it
does
me
good
to
think
of
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
opportunity
!
<EOS>
But
it
led
to
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
I
do
n't
know
what
would
.
<EOS>
There
's
no
spirit
among
the
people
in
these
here
times
.
 
<EOS>
Bring
something
to
eat
and
drink
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
disgusted
with
humanity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
what
account
?
"
asked
Mr
Tappertit
,
who
had
been
quenching
his
fiery
face
in
a
half
-
gallon
<EOS>
can
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
consider
this
a
good
beginning
,
mister
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Give
me
security
that
it
an't
a
ending
,
"
rejoined
the
hangman
.
<EOS>
"
When
that
soldier
went
down
,
we
might
have
made
London
ours
;
but
no
;
---
we
stand
,
and
gape
,
and
look
on
---
the
justice
(
I
wish
he
had
had
a
bullet
in
each
eye
,
as
he
would
have
had
,
if
we
'd
gone
to
work
my
way
)
<EOS>
says
,
"
My
lads
,
if
you
'll
give
me
your
word
to
disperse
,
I
'll
order
off
the
military
,
"
our
people
sets
up
a
hurrah
,
throws
up
the
game
with
the
winning
cards
in
their
hands
,
and
skulks
away
like
a
pack
of
tame
curs
as
they
are
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
"
said
the
hangman
,
in
a
tone
of
deep
disgust
,
"
it
makes
me
blush
for
my
feller
creeturs
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
been
born
a
ox
,
I
do
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
'd
have
been
quite
as
agreeable
a
character
if
you
had
been
,
I
think
,
"
returned
Simon
Tappertit
,
going
out
in
a
lofty
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
too
sure
of
that
,
"
rejoined
the
hangman
,
calling
after
him
;
"
if
I
was
a
horned
animal
at
the
present
moment
,
with
the
smallest
grain
of
sense
,
I
'd
toss
every
man
in
this
company
,
excepting
them
two
,
"
meaning
Hugh
and
Barnaby
,
"
for
his
manner
of
conducting
himself
this
day
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
which
mournful
review
of
their
proceedings
,
Mr
Dennis
sought
consolation
in
cold
boiled
beef
and
beer
;
but
without
at
all
relaxing
the
grim
and
dissatisfied
expression
of
his
face
,
the
gloom
of
which
was
rather
deepened
than
dissipated
by
their
grateful
influence
.
  
<EOS>
The
company
who
were
thus
libelled
might
have
retaliated
by
strong
words
,
if
not
by
blows
,
but
they
were
dispirited
and
worn
out
.
 
<EOS>
The
greater
part
of
them
had
fasted
since
morning
;
all
had
suffered
extremely
from
the
excessive
heat
;
and
between
the
day
's
shouting
,
exertion
,
and
excitement
,
many
had
quite
lost
their
voices
,
and
so
much
of
their
strength
that
they
could
hardly
stand
.
 
<EOS>
Then
they
were
uncertain
what
to
do
next
,
fearful
of
the
consequences
of
what
they
had
done
already
,
and
sensible
that
after
all
they
had
carried
no
point
,
but
had
indeed
left
matters
worse
than
they
had
found
them
.
 
<EOS>
Of
those
who
had
come
to
The
Boot
,
many
dropped
off
within
an
hour
;
such
of
them
as
were
really
honest
and
sincere
,
never
,
after
the
morning
's
experience
,
to
return
,
or
to
hold
any
communication
with
their
late
companions
.
 
<EOS>
Others
remained
but
to
refresh
themselves
,
and
then
went
home
desponding
;
others
who
had
theretofore
been
regular
in
their
attendance
,
avoided
the
place
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
The
half
-
dozen
prisoners
whom
the
Guards
had
taken
,
were
magnified
by
report
into
half
-
a
-
hundred
at
least
;
and
their
friends
,
being
faint
and
sober
,
so
slackened
in
their
energy
,
and
so
drooped
beneath
these
dispiriting
influences
,
that
by
eight
o'clock
in
the
evening
,
Dennis
,
Hugh
,
and
Barnaby
,
were
left
alone
.
<EOS>
Even
they
were
fast
asleep
upon
the
benches
,
when
Gashford
's
entrance
roused
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
you
ARE
here
then
?
"
said
the
Secretary
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
where
should
we
be
,
Muster
Gashford
!
"
<EOS>
Dennis
rejoined
as
he
rose
into
a
sitting
posture
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
nowhere
,
nowhere
,
"
he
returned
with
excessive
mildness
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
streets
are
filled
with
blue
cockades
.
 
<EOS>
I
rather
thought
you
might
have
been
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
you
are
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
orders
for
us
,
master
,
then
?
"
said
Hugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
Not
I.
 
<EOS>
No
orders
,
my
good
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
What
orders
should
I
have
?
 
<EOS>
You
are
not
in
my
service
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Muster
Gashford
,
"
remonstrated
Dennis
,
"
we
belong
to
the
cause
,
do
n't
we
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
cause
!
<EOS>
"
repeated
the
secretary
,
looking
at
him
in
a
sort
of

Lost

Oh
yes

You
have
heard

I
suppose

The

rejected
by
a
hundred

ninety

two

It
's
quite
final

We
might
have
spared
ourselves
some
trouble

<EOS>
That
,
and
my
lord
's
vexation
,
are
the
only
circumstances
I
regret

<EOS>
I
am
quite
satisfied
in

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
he
said
this
,
he
took
a
penknife
from
his
pocket
,
and
putting
his
hat
upon
his
knee
,
began
to
busy
himself
in
ripping
off
the
blue
cockade
which
he
had
worn
all
day
;
at
the
same
time
humming
a
psalm
tune
which
had
been
very
popular
in
the
morning
,
and
dwelling
on
it
with
a
gentle
regret
.
  
<EOS>
His
two
adherents
looked
at
each
other
,
and
at
him
,
as
if
they
were
at
a
loss
how
to
pursue
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
Hugh
,
after
some
elbowing
and
winking
between
himself
and
Mr
Dennis
,
ventured
to
stay
his
hand
,
and
to
ask
him
why
he
meddled
with
that
riband
in
his
hat
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
,
"
said
the
secretary
,
looking
up
with
something
between
a
snarl
and
a
smile
;
"
because
to
sit
still
and
wear
it
,
or
to
fall
asleep
and
wear
it
,
is
a
mockery
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
all
,
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
would
you
have
us
do
,
master
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Hugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
"
returned
Gashford
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
,
"
nothing
.
<EOS>
When
my
lord
was
reproached
and
threatened
for
standing
by
you
,
I
,
as
a
prudent
man
,
would
have
had
you
do
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
soldiers
were
trampling
you
under
their
horses
'
feet
,
I
would
have
had
you
do
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
When
one
of
them
was
struck
down
by
a
daring
hand
,
and
I
saw
confusion
and
dismay
in
all
their
faces
,
I
would
have
had
you
do
nothing
---
<EOS>
just
what
you
did
,
in
short
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
young
man
who
had
so
little
prudence
and
so
much
boldness
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sorry
,
master
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Hugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sorry
,
Muster
Gashford
!
"
echoed
Dennis
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
case
there
should
be
a
proclamation
out
to
-
morrow
,
offering
five
hundred
pounds
,
or
some
such
trifle
,
for
his
apprehension
;
and
in
case
it
should
include
another
man
who
dropped
into
the
lobby
from
the
stairs
above
,
"
said
Gashford
,
coldly
;
"
still
,
do
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Fire
and
fury
,
master
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Hugh
,
starting
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
have
we
done
,
that
you
should
talk
to
us
like
this
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
"
returned
Gashford
with
a
sneer
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
cast
into
prison
;
if
the
young
man
---
"
here
he
looked
hard
at
Barnaby
's
attentive
face
---
"
is
dragged
from
us
and
from
his
friends
;
perhaps
from
people
whom
he
loves
,
and
whom
his
death
would
kill
;
is
thrown
into
jail
,
brought
out
and
hanged
before
their
eyes
;
still
,
do
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
find
it
your
best
policy
,
I
have
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Come
on
!
"
cried
Hugh
,
striding
towards
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dennis
---
 
Barnaby
---
come
on
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
?
 
<EOS>
To
do
what
?
<EOS>
"
said
Gashford
,
slipping
past
him
,
and
standing
with
his
back
against
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Anywhere
!
 
<EOS>
Anything
!
"
cried
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stand
aside
,
master
,
or
the
window
will
serve
our
turn
as
well
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
out
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
ha
ha
!
 
<EOS>
You
are
of
such
---
of
such
an
impetuous
nature
,
"
said
Gashford
,
changing
his
manner
for
one
of
the
utmost
good
fellowship
and
the
pleasantest
raillery
;
"
you
are
such
an
excitable
creature
---
 
<EOS>
but
you
'll
drink
with
me
before
you
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
---
certainly
,
"
growled
Dennis
,
drawing
his
sleeve
across
his
thirsty
lips
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
malice
,
brother
.
 
<EOS>
Drink
with
Muster
Gashford
!
"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
wiped
his
heated
brow
,
and
relaxed
into
a
smile
.
 
<EOS>
The
artful
secretary
laughed
outright
.
  
<EOS>
"
Some
liquor
here
!
 
<EOS>
Be
quick
,
or
he
'll
not
stop
,
even
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
man
of
such
desperate
ardour
!
"
said
the
smooth
secretary
,
whom
Mr
Dennis
corroborated
with
sundry
nods
and
muttered
oaths
---
"
Once
roused
,
he
is
a
fellow
of
such
fierce
determination
!
"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
poised
his
sturdy
arm
aloft
,
and
clapping
Barnaby
on
the
back
,
bade
him
fear
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
They
shook
hands
together
---
poor
Barnaby
evidently
possessed
with
the
idea
that
he
was
among
the
most
virtuous
and
disinterested
heroes
in
the
world
---
and
Gashford
laughed
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hear
,
"
he
said
smoothly
,
as
he
stood
among
them
with
a
great
measure
of
liquor
in
his
hand
,
and
filled
their
glasses
as
quickly
and
as
often
as
they
chose
,
"
I
hear
---
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
say
whether
it
be
true
or
false
---
that
the
men
who
are
loitering
in
the
streets
to
-
night
are
half
disposed
to
pull
down
a
Romish
chapel
or
two
,
and
that
they
only
want
leaders
.
 
<EOS>
I
even
heard
mention
of
those
in
Duke
Street
,
Lincoln
's
Inn
Fields
,
and
in
Warwick
Street
,
Golden
Square
;
but
common
report
,
you
know
---
You
are
not
going
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
---
"
To
do
nothing
,
rnaster
,
eh
?
"
cried
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
jails
and
halter
for
Barnaby
and
me
.
 
<EOS>
They
must
be
frightened
out
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
Leaders
are
wanted
,
are
they
?
 
<EOS>
Now
boys
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
most
impetuous
fellow
!
"
cried
the
secretary
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
ha
!
 
<EOS>
A
courageous
,
boisterous
,
most
vehement
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
A
man
who
---
"
  
There
was
no
need
to
finish
the
sentence
,
for
they
had
rushed
out
of
the
house
,
and
were
far
beyond
hearing
.
 
<EOS>
He
stopped
in
the
middle
of
a
laugh
,
listened
,
drew
on
his
gloves
,
and
,
clasping
his
hands
behind
him
,
paced
the
deserted
room
for
a
long
time
,
then
bent
his
steps
towards
the
busy
town
,
and
walked
into
the
streets
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
filled
with
people
,
for
the
rumour
of
that
day
's
proceedings
had
made
a
great
noise
.
 
<EOS>
Those
persons
who
did
not
care
to
leave
home
,
were
at
their
doors
or
windows
,
and
one
topic
of
discourse
prevailed
on
every
side
.
 
<EOS>
Some
reported
that
the
riots
were
effectually
put
down
;
others
that
they
had
broken
out
again
:
some
said
that
Lord
George
Gordon
had
been
sent
under
a
strong
guard
to
the
Tower
;
others
that
an
attempt
had
been
made
upon
the
King
's
life
,
that
the
soldiers
had
been
again
called
out
,
and
that
the
noise
of
musketry
in
a
distant
part
of
the
town
had
been
plainly
heard
within
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
grew
darker
,
these
stories
became
more
direful
and
mysterious
;
and
often
,
when
some
frightened
passenger
ran
past
with
tidings
that
the
rioters
were
not
far
off
,
and
were
coming
up
,
the
doors
were
shut
and
barred
,
lower
windows
made
secure
,
and
as
much
consternation
engendered
,
as
if
the
city
were
invaded
by
a
foreign
army
.
  
<EOS>
Gashford
walked
stealthily
about
,
listening
to
all
he
heard
,
and
diffusing
or
confirming
,
whenever
he
had
an
opportunity
,
such
false
intelligence
as
suited
his
own
purpose
;
and
,
busily
occupied
in
this
way
,
turned
into
Holborn
for
the
twentieth
time
,
when
a
great
many
women
and
children
came
flying
along
the
street
---
often
panting
and
looking
back
---
and
the
confused
murmur
of
numerous
voices
struck
upon
his
ear
.
 
<EOS>
Assured
by
these
tokens
,
and
by
the
red
light
which
began
to
flash
upon
the
houses
on
either
side
,
that
some
of
his
friends
were
indeed
approaching
,
he
begged
a
moment
's
shelter
at
a
door
which
opened
as
he
passed
,
and
running
with
some
other
persons
to
an
upper
window
,
looked
out
upon
the
crowd
.
  
<EOS>
They
had
torches
among
them
,
and
the
chief
faces
were
distinctly
visible
.
 
<EOS>
That
they
had
been
engaged
in
the
destruction
of
some
building
<EOS>
was
sufficiently
apparent
,
and
that
it
was
a
Catholic
place
of
worship
was
evident
from
the
spoils
they
bore
as
trophies
,
which
were
easily
recognisable
for
the
vestments
of
priests
,
and
rich
fragments
of
altar
furniture
.
 
<EOS>
Covered
with
soot
,
and
dirt
,
and
dust
,
and
lime
;
their
garments
torn
to
rags
;
their
hair
hanging
wildly
about
them
;
their
hands
and
faces
jagged
and
bleeding
with
the
wounds
of
rusty
nails
;
Barnaby
,
Hugh
,
and
Dennis
hurried
on
before
them
all
,
like
hideous
madmen
.
 
<EOS>
After
them
,
the
dense
throng
came
fighting
on
:
some
singing
;
<EOS>
some
shouting
in
triumph
;
some
quarrelling
among
themselves
;
some
menacing
the
spectators
as
they
passed
;
some
with
great
wooden
fragments
,
on
which
they
spent
their
rage
as
if
they
had
been
alive
,
rending
them
limb
from
limb
,
and
hurling
the
scattered
morsels
high
into
the
air
;
some
in
a
drunken
state
,
unconscious
of
the
hurts
they
had
received
from
falling
bricks
,
and
stones
,
and
beams
;
one
borne
upon
a
shutter
,
in
the
very
midst
,
covered
with
a
dingy
cloth
,
a
senseless
,
ghastly
heap
.
<EOS>
Thus
---
a
vision
of
coarse
faces
,
with
here
<EOS>
and
there
a
blot
of
flaring
,
smoky
light
;
a
dream
of
demon
heads
and
savage
eyes
,
and
sticks
and
iron
bars
uplifted
in
the
air
,
and
whirled
about
;
a
bewildering
horror
,
in
which
so
much
was
seen
,
and
yet
so
little
,
which
seemed
so
long
,
and
yet
so
short
,
in
which
there
were
so
many
phantoms
,
not
to
be
forgotten
all
through
life
,
and
yet
so
many
things
that
could
not
be
observed
in
one
distracting
glimpse
---
it
flitted
onward
,
and
was
gone
.
  
<EOS>
As
it
passed
away
upon
its
work
of
wrath
and
ruin
,
a
piercing
scream
was
heard
.
 
<EOS>
A
knot
of
persons
ran
towards
the
spot
;
Gashford
,
who
just
then
emerged
into
the
street
,
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
on
the
outskirts
of
the
little
concourse
,
and
could
not
see
or
hear
what
passed
within
;
but
one
who
had
a
better
place
,
informed
him
that
a
widow
woman
had
descried
her
son
among
the
rioters
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
all
?
"
said
the
secretary
,
turning
his
face
homewards
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
I
think
this
looks
a
little
more
like
business
!
"
    
<EOS>
Chapter
51
    
Promising
<EOS>
as
these
outrages
were
to
Gashford
's
view
,
and
much
like
business
as
they
looked
,
they
extended
that
night
no
farther
.
 
<EOS>
The
soldiers
were
again
called
out
,
again
they
took
half
-
a
-
dozen
prisoners
,
and
again
the
crowd
dispersed
after
a
short
and
bloodless
scuffle
.
 
<EOS>
Hot
and
drunken
though
they
were
,
they
had
not
yet
broken
all
bounds
and
set
all
law
and
government
at
defiance
.
<EOS>
Something
of
their
habitual
deference
to
the
authority
erected
by
society
for
its
own
preservation
yet
remained
among
them
,
and
had
its
majesty
been
vindicated
in
time
,
the
secretary
would
have
had
to
digest
a
bitter
disappointment
.
  
<EOS>
By
midnight
,
the
streets
were
clear
and
quiet
,
and
,
save
that
there
stood
in
two
parts
of
the
town
a
heap
of
nodding
walls
and
pile
of
rubbish
,
where
there
had
been
at
sunset
a
rich
and
handsome
building
,
everything
wore
its
usual
aspect
.
 
<EOS>
Even
the
Catholic
gentry
and
tradesmen
,
of
whom
there
were
many
resident
in
different
parts
of
the
City
and
its
suburbs
,
had
no
fear
for
their
lives
or
property
,
and
but
little
indignation
for
the
wrong
they
had
already
sustained
in
the
plunder
and
destruction
of
their
temples
of
worship
.
 
<EOS>
An
honest
confidence
in
the
government
under
whose
protection
they
had
lived
for
many
years
,
and
a
well
-
founded
reliance
on
the
good
feeling
and
right
thinking
of
the
great
mass
of
the
community
,
with
whom
,
notwithstanding
their
religious
differences
,
they
were
every
day
in
habits
of
confidential
,
affectionate
,
and
friendly
intercourse
,
reassured
them
,
even
under
the
excesses
that
had
been
committed
;
and
convinced
them
that
they
who
were
Protestants
in
anything
<EOS>
but
the
name
,
were
no
more
to
be
considered
as
abettors
of
these
disgraceful
occurrences
,
than
they
themselves
were
chargeable
with
the
uses
of
the
block
,
the
rack
,
the
gibbet
,
and
the
stake
in
cruel
Mary
's
reign
.
  
<EOS>
The
clock
was
on
the
stroke
of
one
,
when
Gabriel
Varden
,
with
his
lady
and
Miss
Miggs
,
sat
waiting
in
the
little
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
This
fact
;
the
toppling
wicks
of
the
dull
,
wasted
candles
;
the
silence
that
prevailed
;
and
,
above
all
,
the
nightcaps
of
both
maid
and
matron
,
were
sufficient
evidence
that
they
had
been
prepared
for
bed
some
time
ago
,
and
had
some
reason
for
sitting
up
so
far
beyond
their
usual
hour
.
  
<EOS>
If
any
other
corroborative
testimony
had
been
required
,
it
would
have
been
abundantly
furnished
in
the
actions
of
Miss
Miggs
,
who
,
having
arrived
at
that
restless
state
and
sensitive
condition
of
the
nervous
system
which
are
the
result
of
long
watching
,
did
,
by
a
constant
rubbing
and
tweaking
of
her
nose
,
a
perpetual
change
of
position
(
arising
from
the
sudden
growth
of
imaginary
knots
and
knobs
in
her
chair
)
,
a
frequent
friction
of
her
eyebrows
,
the
incessant
recurrence
of
a
small
cough
,
a
small
groan
,
a
gasp
,
a
sigh
,
a
sniff
,
a
spasmodic
start
,
and
by
other
demonstrations
of
that
nature
,
so
file
down
and
rasp
,
as
it
were
,
the
patience
of
the
locksmith
,
that
after
looking
at
her
in
silence
for
some
time
,
he
at
last
broke
out
into
this
apostrophe
:
---
   
<EOS>
"
Miggs
,
my
good
girl
,
go
to
bed
---
do
go
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
really
worse
than
the
dripping
of
a
hundred
water
-
butts
outside
the
window
,
or
the
scratching
of
as
many
mice
behind
the
wainscot
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
bear
it
.
 
<EOS>
Do
go
to
bed
,
Miggs
.
 
<EOS>
To
oblige
me
---
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
n't
got
nothing
to
untie
,
sir
,
"
returned
Miss
Miggs
,
"
and
therefore
your
requests
does
not
surprise
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
missis
has
---
and
<EOS>
while
you
sit
up
,
mim
"
---
she
added
,
turning
to
the
locksmith
's
wife
,
"
I
could
n't
,
no
,
<EOS>
not
if
twenty
times
the
quantity
of
cold
water
was
aperiently
running
down
my
back
at
this
moment
,
go
to
bed
with
a
quiet
spirit
.
"
  
<EOS>
Having
spoken
these
words
,
Miss
Miggs
made
divers
efforts
to
rub
her
shoulders
in
an
impossible
place
,
and
shivered
from
head
to
foot
;
thereby
giving
the
beholders
to
understand
that
the
imaginary
cascade
was
still
in
full
flow
,
but
that
a
sense
of
duty
upheld
her
under
that
and
all
other
sufferings
,
and
nerved
her
to
endurance
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
being
too
sleepy
to
speak
,
and
Miss
Miggs
having
,
as
the
phrase
is
,
said
her
say
,
the
locksmith
had
nothing
for
it
but
to
sigh
and
be
as
quiet
as
he
could
.
  
<EOS>
But
to
be
quiet
with
such
a
basilisk
before
him
was
impossible
.
<EOS>
If
he
looked
another
way
,
it
was
worse
to
feel
that
she
was
rubbing
her
cheek
,
or
twitching
her
ear
,
or
winking
her
eye
,
or
making
all
kinds
of
extraordinary
shapes
with
her
nose
,
than
to
see
her
do
it
.
<EOS>
If
she
was
for
a
moment
free
from
any
of
these
complaints
,
it
was
only
because
of
her
foot
being
asleep
,
or
of
her
arm
having
got
the
fidgets
,
or
of
her
leg
being
doubled
up
with
the
cramp
,
or
of
some
other
horrible
disorder
which
racked
her
whole
frame
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
did
enjoy
a
moment
's
ease
,
then
with
her
eyes
shut
and
her
mouth
wide
open
,
she
would
be
seen
to
sit
very
stiff
and
upright
in
her
chair
;
then
to
nod
a
little
way
forward
,
and
stop
with
a
jerk
;
then
to
nod
a
little
farther
forward
,
and
stop
with
another
jerk
;
then
to
recover
herself
;
then
to
come
forward
again
---
lower
---
<EOS>
lower
---
lower
---
 
by
very
slow
degrees
,
until
,
just
as
it
seemed
impossible
that
she
could
preserve
her
balance
for
another
instant
,
and
the
locksmith
was
about
to
call
out
in
an
agony
,
to
save
her
from
dashing
down
upon
her
forehead
and
fracturing
her
skull
,
then
all
of
a
sudden
and
without
the
smallest
notice
,
she
would
come
upright
and
rigid
again
with
her
eyes
open
,
and
in
her
countenance
an
expression
of
defiance
,
sleepy
but
yet
most
obstinate
,
which
plainly
said
,
"
I
've
never
once
closed
'em
since
I
looked
at
you
last
,
and
I
'll
take
my
oath
of
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
At
length
,
after
the
clock
had
struck
two
,
there
was
a
sound
at
the
street
door
,
as
if
somebody
had
fallen
against
the
knocker
by
accident
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Miggs
immediately
jumping
up
and
clapping
her
hands
,
cried
with
a
drowsy
mingling
of
the
sacred
and
profane
,
"
<EOS>
Ally
Looyer
,
mim
!
<EOS>
there
's
Simmuns
's
knock
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
's
there
?
"
said
Gabriel
.
  
<EOS>
"
Me
!
"
cried
the
well
-
known
voice
of
Mr
Tappertit
.
 
<EOS>
Gabriel
opened
the
door
,
and
gave
him
admission
.
  
<EOS>
He
did
not
cut
a
very
insinuating
figure
,
for
a
man
of
his
stature
suffers
in
a
crowd
;
and
having
been
active
in
yesterday
morning
's
work
,
his
dress
was
literally
crushed
from
head
to
foot
:
his
hat
being
beaten
out
of
all
shape
,
and
his
shoes
trodden
down
at
heel
like
slippers
.
 
<EOS>
His
coat
fluttered
in
strips
about
him
,
the
buckles
were
torn
away
both
from
his
knees
and
feet
,
half
his
neckerchief
was
gone
,
and
the
bosom
of
his
shirt
was
rent
to
tatters
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
notwithstanding
all
these
personal
disadvantages
;
despite
his
being
very
weak
from
heat
and
fatigue
;
and
so
begrimed
with
mud
and
dust
that
he
might
have
been
in
a
case
,
for
anything
of
the
real
texture
(
either
of
his
skin
or
apparel
)
that
the
eye
could
discern
;
he
stalked
haughtily
into
the
parlour
,
and
throwing
himself
into
a
chair
,
and
endeavouring
to
thrust
his
hands
into
the
pockets
of
his
small
-
clothes
,
which
were
turned
inside
out
and
displayed
upon
his
legs
,
like
tassels
,
surveyed
the
household
with
a
gloomy
dignity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Simon
,
"
said
the
locksmith
gravely
,
"
how
comes
it
that
you
return
home
at
this
time
of
night
,
and
in
this
condition
?
 
<EOS>
Give
me
an
assurance
that
you
have
not
been
among
the
rioters
,
and
I
am
satisfied
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
replied
Mr
Tappertit
,
with
a
contemptuous
look
,
"
I
wonder
at
YOUR
assurance
in
making
such
demands
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
drinking
,
"
said
the
locksmith
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
a
general
principle
,
and
in
the
most
offensive
sense
of
the
words
,
sir
,
"
returned
his
journeyman
with
great
self
-
possession
,
"
I
consider
you
a
liar
.
 
<EOS>
In
that
last
observation
you
have
unintentionally
---
unintentionally
,
sir
,
---
struck
upon
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Martha
,
"
said
the
locksmith
,
turning
to
his
wife
,
and
shaking
his
head
sorrowfully
,
while
a
smile
at
the
absurd
figure
beside
him
still
played
upon
his
open
face
,
"
I
trust
it
may
turn
out
that
this
poor
lad
is
not
the
victim
of
the
knaves
and
fools
we
have
so
often
had
words
about
,
and
who
have
done
so
much
harm
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
has
been
at
Warwick
Street
or
Duke
Street
to
-
night
---
"
  
"
He
has
been
at
neither
,
sir
,
"
cried
Mr
Tappertit
in
a
loud
voice
,
which
he
suddenly
dropped
into
a
whisper
as
he
repeated
,
with
eyes
fixed
upon
the
locksmith
,
"
he
has
been
at
neither
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
of
it
,
with
all
my
heart
,
"
said
the
locksmith
in
a
serious
tone
;
"
for
if
he
had
been
,
and
it
could
be
proved
against
him
,
Martha
,
your
Great
Association
would
have
been
to
him
the
cart
that
draws
men
to
the
gallows
and
leaves
them
hanging
in
the
air
.
<EOS>
It
would
,
as
sure
as
we
're
alive
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
was
too
much
scared
by
Simon
's
altered
manner
and
appearance
,
and
by
the
accounts
of
the
rioters
which
had
reached
her
ears
that
night
,
to
offer
any
retort
,
or
to
have
recourse
to
her
usual
matrimonial
policy
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Miggs
wrung
her
hands
,
and
wept
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
was
not
at
Duke
Street
,
or
at
Warwick
Street
,
G
Varden
,
"
said
Simon
,
sternly
;
"
but
he
WAS
at
Westminster
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
sir
,
he
kicked
a
county
member
,
perhaps
,
sir
,
he
tapped
a
lord
---
you
may
stare
,
<EOS>
sir
,
I
repeat
it
---
blood
flowed
from
noses
,
and
perhaps
he
tapped
a
lord
.
 
<EOS>
Who
knows
?
 
<EOS>
This
<EOS>
,
"
he
added
,
putting
his
hand
into
his
waistcoat
-
pocket
,
and
taking
out
a
large
tooth
,
at
the
sight
of
which
both
Miggs
and
Mrs
Varden
screamed
,
"
this
was
a
bishop
's
.
<EOS>
Beware
,
G
Varden
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
I
would
rather
,
"
said
the
locksmith
hastily
,
"
have
paid
five
hundred
pounds
,
than
had
this
come
to
pass
.
 
<EOS>
You
idiot
<EOS>
,
do
you
know
what
peril
you
stand
in
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
,
sir
,
"
replied
his
journeyman
,
"
and
it
is
my
glory
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
there
,
everybody
saw
me
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
conspicuous
,
and
prominent
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
abide
the
consequences
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
locksmith
,
really
disturbed
and
agitated
,
paced
to
and
fro
in
silence
---
glancing
at
his
former
'
prentice
every
now
and
then
---
and
at
length
stopping
before
him
,
said
:
  
"
Get
to
bed
,
and
sleep
for
a
couple
of
hours
that
you
may
wake
penitent
,
and
with
some
of
your
senses
about
you
.
 
<EOS>
Be
sorry
for
what
you
have
done
,
and
we
will
try
to
save
you
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
call
him
by
five
o'clock
,
"
said
Varden
,
turning
hurriedly
to
his
wife
,
and
he
washes
himself
clean
and
changes
his
dress
,
he
may
get
to
the
Tower
Stairs
,
and
away
by
the
Gravesend
tide
-
boat
,
before
any
search
is
made
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
From
there
he
can
easily
get
on
to
Canterbury
,
where
your
cousin
will
give
him
work
till
this
storm
has
blown
over
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
sure
that
I
do
right
in
screening
him
from
the
punishment
he
deserves
,
but
he
has
lived
in
this
house
,
man
and
boy
,
for
a
dozen
years
,
and
I
should
be
sorry
if
for
this
one
day
's
work
he
made
a
miserable
end
.
 
<EOS>
Lock
the
front
-
door
,
Miggs
,
and
show
no
light
towards
the
street
when
you
go
upstairs
.
 
<EOS>
Quick
,
Simon
!
<EOS>
Get
to
bed
!
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
do
you
suppose
,
sir
,
"
retorted
Mr
Tappertit
,
with
a
thickness
and
slowness
of
speech
which
contrasted
forcibly
with
the
rapidity
and
earnestness
of
his
kind
-
hearted
master
---
"
and
<EOS>
do
you
suppose
,
sir
,
that
I
am
base
and
mean
enough
to
accept
your
servile
proposition
?
---
<EOS>
Miscreant
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whatever
you
please
,
Sim
,
but
get
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
Every
minute
is
of
consequence

<EOS>
The

Miggs

"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
yes
,
oh
do

<EOS>
Go
to
bed
directly
,
"
cried
the
two
women
together
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Tappertit
stood
upon
his
feet
,
and
pushing
his
chair
away
to
show
that
he
needed
no
assistance
,
answered
,
swaying
himself
to
and
fro
,
and
managing
his
head
as
if
it
had
no
connection
whatever
with
his
body
:
  
<EOS>
"
You
spoke
of
Miggs
,
sir
---
Miggs
may
be
smothered
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
Simmun

"
<EOS>
ejaculated
that
young
lady
in
a
faint
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
mim
!
<EOS>
Oh
sir
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
goodness
gracious
,
what
a
turn
he
has
give
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
family
may
ALL
be
smothered
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mr
Tappertit
,
after
glancing
at
her
with
a
smile
of
ineffable
disdain
,
"
excepting
Mrs
V.
 
<EOS>
I
have
come
here
,
sir
,
for
her
sake
,
this
night

<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
,
take
this
piece
of
paper
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
protection
,
ma'am

<EOS>
You
may
need
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
these
words
he
held
out
at
arm
's
length
,
a
dirty
,
crumpled
scrap
of
writing
.
 
<EOS>
The
locksmith
took
it
from
him
,
opened
it
,
and
read
as
follows
:
  
<EOS>
"
All
good
friends
to
our
cause
,
I
hope
will
be
particular
,
and
do
no
injury
to
the
property

any
true
Protestant
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
well
assured
that
the
proprietor
of
this
house
is
a
staunch
and
worthy
friend
to
the
cause

<EOS>
GEORGE
GORDON

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
this
!
"
said
the
locksmith
,
with
an
altered
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Something
that
'll
do
you
good
service
,
young
feller
,
"
replied
his
journeyman
,
"
as
you
'll
find
.
 
<EOS>
Keep
that
safe
,
and
where
you
can
lay
your
hand
upon
it
in
an
instant
.
 
<EOS>
And
chalk
"
No

on
your
door
to

morrow
night
,
and
for
a
week
to
come
<EOS>
---
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
genuine
document
,
"
said
the
locksmith
,
"
I
know
,
for
I
have
seen
the
hand
before
.
 
<EOS>
What
threat
does
it
imply
?
 
<EOS>
What
devil
is
abroad
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
fiery
devil
,
"
retorted
Sim
;
"
a
flaming

furious
devil

<EOS>
Do
n't
you
put
yourself
in
its

Be

<EOS>
Farewell

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
here
the
two
women
threw
themselves
in
his
way
---
especially
Miss
Miggs
,
who
fell
upon
him
with
such
fervour
that
she
pinned
him
against
the
wall
---
and
conjured
him
in
moving
words
not
to
go
forth
till
he
was
sober
;
to
listen
to
reason
;
to
think
of
it
;
to
take
some
rest
,
and
then
determine
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
,
"
that
my
mind
is
made
up
.
 
<EOS>
My
bleeding
country
calls
me
<EOS>
and
I
go
!
 
<EOS>
Miggs
,
if
you
do
n't
get
out
of
the
way
,
I
'll
pinch
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Miggs
,
still
clinging
to
the
rebel
,
screamed
once
vociferously
---
but
whether
in
the
distraction
of
her
mind
,
or
because
of
his
having
executed
his
threat
,
is
uncertain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Release
me

"
said
Simon
,
struggling
to
free
himself
from
her
chaste
,
but
spider
-
like
embrace
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
go
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
made
arrangements
for
you
in
an
altered
state
of
society
,
and
mean
to
provide
for
you
comfortably
in
life
---
there
!
 
<EOS>
Will
that
satisfy
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
Simmun
!
"
cried
Miss
Miggs
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
my
blessed
Simmun
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
mim
!
<EOS>
what
are
my
feelings
at
this
conflicting
moment
!
"
  
<EOS>
Of
a
rather
turbulent
description
,
it
would
seem
;
for
her
nightcap
had
been
knocked
off
in
the
scuffle
,
and
she
was
on
her
knees
upon
the
floor
,
making
a
strange
revelation
of
blue
and
yellow
curl
-
papers
,
straggling
locks
of
hair
,
tags
of
staylaces
,
and
strings
of
it
's
impossible
to
say
what
;
panting
for
breath
,
clasping
her
hands
,
turning
her
eyes
upwards
,
shedding
abundance
of
tears
,
and
exhibiting
various
other
symptoms
of
the
acutest
mental
suffering
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
leave
,
"
said
Simon
,
turning
to
his
master
,
with
an
utter
disregard
of
Miggs
's
maidenly
affliction
,
"
a
box
of
things
upstairs
.
 
<EOS>
Do
what
you
like
with
'em
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
'em
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
never
coming
back
here
,
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
Provide
yourself
,
sir
,
with
a
journeyman
;
I
'm
my
country
's
journeyman
;
henceforward
that
's
MY
line
of
business
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Be
what
you
like
in
two
hours
'
time
,
but
now
go
up
to
bed
,
"
returned
the
locksmith
,
planting
himself
in
the
doorway
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
hear
me
?
 
<EOS>
Go
to
bed
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hear
you
,
and
defy
you
,
Varden
,
"
rejoined
Simon
Tappertit
.
"
<EOS>
This
night
,
sir
,
I
have
been
in
the
country
,
planning
an
expedition
which
shall
fill
your
bell
-
hanging
soul
with
wonder
and
dismay
.
 
<EOS>
The
plot
demands
my
utmost
energy
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
pass
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
knock
you
down
if
you
come
near
the
door
,
"
replied
the
locksmith
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
go
to
bed
!
"
  
<EOS>
Simon
made
no
answer
,
but
gathering
himself
up
as
straight
as
he
could
,
plunged
head
foremost
at
his
old
master
,
and
the
two
went
driving
out
into
the
workshop
together
,
plying
their
hands
and
feet
so
briskly
that
they
looked
like
half
-
a
-
dozen
,
while
Miggs
and
Mrs
Varden
screamed
for
twelve
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
easy
for
Varden
to
knock
his
old
'
prentice
down
,
and
bind
him
hand
and
foot
;
but
as
he
was
loth
to
hurt
him
in
his
then
defenceless
state
,
he
contented
himself
with
parrying
his
blows
when
he
could
,
taking
them
in
perfect
good
part
when
he
could
not
,
and
keeping
between
him
and
the
door
,
until
a
favourable
opportunity
should
present
itself
for
forcing
him
to
retreat
up
-
stairs
,
and
shutting
him
up
in
his
own
room
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
in
the
goodness
of
his
heart
,
he
calculated
too
much
upon
his
adversary
's
weakness
,
and
forgot
that
drunken
men
who
have
lost
the
power
of
walking
steadily
,
can
often
run
.
 
<EOS>
Watching
his
time
,
Simon
Tappertit
made
a
cunning
show
of
falling
back
,
staggered
unexpectedly
forward
,
brushed
past
him
,
opened
the
door
(
he
knew
the
trick
of
that
lock
well
)
,
and
darted
down
the
street
like
a
mad
dog
.
 
<EOS>
The
locksmith
paused
for
a
moment
in
the
excess
of
his
astonishment
,
and
then
gave
chase
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
an
excellent
season
for
a
run
,
for
at
that
silent
hour
the
streets
were
deserted
,
the
air
was
cool
,
and
the
flying
figure
before
him
distinctly
visible
at
a
great
distance
,
as
it
sped
away
,
with
a
long
gaunt
shadow
following
at
its
heels
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
short
-
winded
locksmith
had
no
chance
against
a
man
of
Sim
's
youth
and
spare
figure
,
though
the
day
had
been
when
he
could
have
run
him
down
in
no
time
.
 
<EOS>
The
space
between
them
rapidly
increased
,
and
as
the
rays
of
the
rising
sun
streamed
upon
Simon
in
the
act
of
turning
a
distant
corner
,
Gabriel
Varden
was
fain
to
give
up
,
and
sit
down
on
a
doorstep
to
fetch
his
breath
.
 
<EOS>
Simon
meanwhile
,
without
once
stopping
,
fled
at
the
same
degree
of
swiftness
to
The
Boot
,
where
,
as
he
well
knew
,
some
of
his
company
were
lying
,
and
at
which
respectable
hostelry
---
for
he
had
already
acquired
the
distinction
of
being
in
great
peril
of
the
law
---
a
friendly
watch
had
been
expecting
him
all
night
,
and
was
even
now
on
the
look
-
out
for
his
coming
.
  
<EOS>
"
Go
thy
ways
,
Sim
,
go
thy
ways
,
"
said
the
locksmith
,
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
done
my
best
for
thee
,
poor
lad
,
and
would
have
saved
thee
,
but
the
rope
is
round
thy
neck
,
I
fear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
saying
,
and
shaking
his
head
in
a
very
sorrowful
and
disconsolate
manner
,
he
turned
back
,
and
soon
re
-
entered
his
own
house
,
where
Mrs
Varden
and
the
faithful
Miggs
had
been
anxiously
expecting
his
return
.
  
<EOS>
Now
Mrs
Varden
(
and
by
consequence
Miss
Miggs
likewise
)
was
impressed
with
a
secret
misgiving
that
she
had
done
wrong
;
that
she
had
,
to
the
utmost
of
her
small
means
,
aided
and
abetted
the
growth
of
disturbances
,
the
end
of
which
it
was
impossible
to
foresee
;
that
she
had
led
remotely
to
the
scene
which
had
just
passed
;
and
that
the
locksmith
's
time
for
triumph
and
reproach
had
now
arrived
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
strongly
did
Mrs
Varden
feel
this
,
and
so
crestfallen
was
she
in
consequence
,
that
while
her
husband
was
pursuing
their
lost
journeyman
,
she
secreted
under
her
chair
the
little
red
-
brick
dwelling
-
house
with
the
yellow
roof
,
lest
it
should
furnish
new
occasion
for
reference
to
the
painful
theme
;
and
now
hid
the
same
still
more
,
with
the
skirts
of
her
dress
.
  
<EOS>
But
it
happened
that
the
locksmith
had
been
thinking
of
this
very
article
on
his
way
home
,
and
that
,
coming
into
the
room
and
not
seeing
it
,
he
at
once
demanded
where
it
was
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
had
no
resource
but
to
produce
it
,
which
she
did
with
many
tears
,
and
broken
protestations
that
if
she
could
have
known
---
   
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
"
said
Varden
,
"
<EOS>
of
course
---
I
know
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mean
to
reproach
you
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
But
recollect
from
this
time
that
all
good
things
perverted
to
evil
purposes
,
are
worse
than
those
which
are
naturally
bad
.
 
<EOS>
A
thoroughly
wicked
woman
,
is
wicked
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
When
religion
goes
wrong
,
she
is
very
wrong
,
for
the
same
reason
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
say
no
more
about
it
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
he
dropped
the
red
-
brick
dwelling
-
house
on
the
floor
,
and
setting
his
heel
upon
it
,
crushed
it
into
pieces
.
 
<EOS>
The
halfpence
,
and
sixpences
,
and
other
voluntary
contributions
,
rolled
about
in
all
directions
,
but
nobody
offered
to
touch
them
,
or
to
take
them
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
,
"
said
the
locksmith
,
"
is
easily
disposed
of
,
and
I
would
to
Heaven
that
everything
growing
out
of
the
same
society
could
be
settled
as
easily
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
happens
very
fortunately
,
Varden
,
"
said
his
wife
,
with
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
,
"
that
in
case
any
more
disturbances
should
happen
---
which
I
hope
not
<EOS>
;
I
sincerely
hope
not
---
"
  
"
I
hope
so
too
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
---
That
in
case
any
should
occur
,
we
have
the
piece
of
paper
which
that
poor
misguided
young
man
brought
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
to
be
sure
,
"
said
the
locksmith
,
turning
quickly
round
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
is
that
piece
of
paper
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
stood
aghast
as
he
took
it
from
her
outstretched
band
,
tore
it
into
fragments
,
and
threw
them
under
the
grate
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
use
it
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Use
it
!
"
cried
the
locksmith
.
 
<EOS>
No
!
 
<EOS>
Let
them
come
and
pull
the
roof
about
our
ears
<EOS>
;
let
them
burn
us
out
of
house
and
home
;
I
'd
neither
have
the
protection
of
their
leader
,
nor
chalk
their
howl
upon
my
door
,
though
,
for
not
doing
it
,
they
shot
me
on
my
own
threshold
.
 
<EOS>
Use
it
!
 
<EOS>
Let
them
come
and
do
their
worst
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
man
who
crosses
my
doorstep
on
such
an
errand
as
theirs
,
had
better
be
a
hundred
miles
away
.
 
<EOS>
Let
him
look
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
others
may
have
their
will
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
beg
or
buy
them
off
,
if
,
instead
of
every
pound
of
iron
in
the
place
<EOS>
,
there
was
a
hundred
weight
of
gold
.
<EOS>
Get
you
to
bed
,
Martha
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
take
down
the
shutters
and
go
to
work
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
early
!
"
said
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
"
replied
the
locksmith
cheerily
,
"
so
early
.
 
<EOS>
Come
when
they
may
,
they
shall
not
find
us
skulking
and
hiding
,
as
if
we
feared
to
take
our
portion
of
the
light
of
day
,
and
left
it
all
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
So
pleasant
dreams
to
you
,
my
dear
,
and
cheerful
sleep
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
he
gave
his
wife
a
hearty
kiss
,
and
bade
her
delay
no
longer
,
or
it
would
be
time
to
rise
before
she
lay
down
to
rest
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
quite
amiably
and
meekly
walked
upstairs
,
followed
by
Miggs
,
who
,
although
a
good
deal
subdued
,
could
not
refrain
from
sundry
stimulative
coughs
and
sniffs
by
the
way
,
or
from
holding
up
her
hands
in
astonishment
at
the
daring
conduct
of
master
.

Chapter
52
    
<EOS>
A
mob
is
usually
a
creature
of
very
mysterious
existence
,
particularly
in
a
large
city
.
 
<EOS>
Where
it
comes
from
or
whither
<EOS>
it
goes
,
few
men
can
tell
.
 
<EOS>
Assembling
and
dispersing
with
equal
suddenness
,
it
is
as
difficult
to
follow
to
its
various
sources
as
the
sea
itself
;
nor
does
the
parallel
stop
here
,
for
the
ocean
<EOS>
is
not
more
fickle
and
uncertain
,
more
terrible
when
roused
,
more
unreasonable
,
or
more
cruel
.
  
<EOS>
The
people
who
were
boisterous
at
Westminster
upon
the
Friday
morning
,
and
were
eagerly
bent
upon
the
work
of
devastation
in
Duke
Street
and
Warwick
Street
at
night
,
were
,
in
the
mass
,
the
same
.
<EOS>
Allowing
for
the
chance
accessions
of
which
any
crowd
is
morally
sure
in
a
town
where
there
must
always
be
a
large
number
of
idle
and
profligate
persons
,
one
and
the
same
mob
was
at
both
places
.
<EOS>
Yet
they
spread
themselves
in
various
directions
when
they
dispersed
in
the
afternoon
,
made
no
appointment
for
reassembling
,
had
no
definite
purpose
or
design
,
and
indeed
,
for
anything
they
knew
,
were
scattered
beyond
the
hope
of
future
union
.
  
<EOS>
At
The
Boot
,
which
,
as
has
been
shown
,
was
in
a
manner
the
head
-
quarters
of
the
rioters
,
there
were
not
,
upon
this
Friday
night
,
a
dozen
people
.
 
<EOS>
Some
slept
in
the
stable
and
outhouses
,
some
in
the
common
room
,
some
two
or
three
in
beds
.
 
<EOS>
The
rest
were
in
their
usual
homes
or
haunts
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
not
a
score
in
all
lay
in
the
adjacent
fields
and
lanes
,
and
under
haystacks
,
or
near
the
warmth
of
brick
-
kilns
,
who
had
not
their
accustomed
place
of
rest
beneath
the
open
sky
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
the
public
ways
within
the
town
,
they
had
their
ordinary
nightly
occupants
,
and
no
others
;
the
usual
amount
of
vice
and
wretchedness
,
but
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
The
experience
of
one
evening
,
however
,
had
taught
the
reckless
leaders
of
disturbance
,
that
they
had
but
to
show
themselves
in
the
streets
,
to
be
immediately
surrounded
by
materials
which
they
could
only
have
kept
together
when
their
aid
was
not
required
,
at
great
risk
,
expense
,
and
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
Once
possessed
of
this
secret
,
they
were
as
confident
as
if
<EOS>
twenty
thousand
men
,
devoted
to
their
will
,
had
been
encamped
about
them
,
and
assumed
a
confidence
which
could
not
have
been
surpassed
,
though
that
had
really
been
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
All
day
,
Saturday
,
they
remained
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
On
Sunday
,
they
rather
studied
how
to
keep
their
men
within
call
,
and
in
full
hope
,
than
to
follow
out
,
by
any
fierce
measure
,
their
first
day
's
proceedings
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
"
said
Dennis
,
as
,
with
a
loud
yawn
,
he
raised
his
body
from
a
heap
of
straw
on
which
he
had
been
sleeping
,
and
supporting
his
head
upon
his
hand
,
appealed
to
Hugh
on
Sunday
morning
,
"
that
Muster
Gashford
allows
some
rest
?
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
'd
have
us
at
work
again
already
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
his
way
to
let
matters
drop
,
you
may
be
sure
of
that
,
"
growled
Hugh
in
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
in
no
humour
to
stir
yet
,
though
.
<EOS>
I
'm
as
stiff
as
a
dead
body
,
and
as
full
of
ugly
scratches
as
if
I
had
been
fighting
all
day
yesterday
with
wild
cats
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
've
so
much
enthusiasm
,
that
's
it
,
"
said
Dennis
,
looking
with
great
admiration
at
the
uncombed
head
,
matted
beard
,
and
torn
hands
and
face
of
the
wild
figure
before
him
;
"
you
're
such
a
devil
of
a
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
You
hurt
yourself
a
hundred
times
more
than
you
need
,
because
you
will
be
foremost
in
everything
,
and
will
do
more
than
the
rest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
the
matter
of
that
,
"
returned
Hugh
,
shaking
back
his
ragged
hair
and
glancing
towards
the
door
of
the
stable
in
which
they
lay
;
"
there
's
one
yonder
as
good
as
me
.
 
<EOS>
What
did
I
tell
you
about
him
?
<EOS>
Did
I
say
he
was
worth
a
dozen
,
when
you
doubted
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dennis
rolled
lazily
over
upon
his
breast
,
and
resting
his
chin
upon
his
hand
in
imitation
of
the
attitude
in
which
Hugh
lay
,
said
,
as
he
too
looked
towards
the
door
:
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
you
knew
him
,
brother
,
you
knew
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
who
'd
suppose
to
look
at
that
chap
now
,
that
he
could
be
the
man
he
is
!
 
<EOS>
Is
n't
it
a
thousand
cruel
pities
,
brother
,
that
instead
of
taking
his
nat'ral
rest
and
qualifying
himself
for
further
exertions
in
this
here
honourable
cause
,
he
should
be
playing
at
soldiers
like
a
boy
?
 
<EOS>
And
his
cleanliness
too
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mr
Dennis
,
who
certainly
had
no
reason
to
entertain
a
fellow
feeling
with
anybody
who
was
particular
on
that
score
;
"
what
weaknesses
he
's
guilty
of
;
with
respect
to
his
cleanliness
!
 
<EOS>
At
five
o'clock
this
morning
,
there
he
was
at
the
pump
,
though
any
one
would
think
he
had
gone
through
enough
,
the
day
before
yesterday
,
to
be
pretty
fast
asleep
at
that
time
.
 
<EOS>
But
no
---
when
I
woke
for
a
minute
or
two
,
there
he
was
at
the
pump
,
and
if
you
'd
seen
him
sticking
them
peacock
's
feathers
into
his
hat
when
he
'd
done
washing
---
ah
!
<EOS>
I
'm
sorry
<EOS>
he
's
such
a
imperfect
character
,
but
the
best
on
us
is
incomplete
in
some
pint
of
view
or
another
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
subject
of
this
dialogue
and
of
these
concluding
remarks
,
which
were
uttered
in
a
tone
of
philosophical
meditation
,
was
,
as
the
reader
will
have
divined
,
no
other
than
Barnaby
,
who
,
with
his
flag
in
hand
,
stood
sentry
in
the
little
patch
of
sunlight
at
the
distant
door
,
or
walked
to
and
fro
outside
,
singing
softly
to
himself
;
and
keeping
time
to
the
music
of
some
clear
church
bells
.
<EOS>
Whether
he
stood
still
,
leaning
with
both
hands
on
the
flagstaff
,
or
,
bearing
it
upon
his
shoulder
,
paced
slowly
up
and
down
,
the
careful
arrangement
of
his
poor
dress
,
and
his
erect
and
lofty
bearing
,
showed
how
high
a
sense
he
had
of
the
great
importance
of
his
trust
,
and
how
happy
and
how
proud
it
made
him
.
 
<EOS>
To
Hugh
and
his
companion
,
who
lay
in
a
dark
corner
of
the
gloomy
shed
,
<EOS>
he
,
and
the
sunlight
,
and
the
peaceful
Sabbath
sound
to
which
he
made
response
,
seemed
like
a
bright
picture
framed
by
the
door
,
and
set
off
by
the
stable
's
blackness
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
formed
such
a
contrast
to
themselves
,
as
they
lay
wallowing
,
like
some
obscene
animals
,
in
their
squalor
and
wickedness
on
the
two
heaps
of
straw
,
that
for
a
few
moments
they
looked
on
without
speaking
,
and
felt
almost
ashamed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
Hugh
at
length
,
carrying
it
off
with
a
laugh
:
"
<EOS>
He
's
a
rare
fellow
is
Barnaby
,
and
can
do
more
,
with
less
rest
,
or
meat
,
or
drink
,
than
any
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
his
soldiering
,
I
put
him
on
duty
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
there
was
a
object
in
it
,
and
a
proper
good
one
too
,
I
'll
be
sworn
,
"
retorted
Dennis
with
a
broad
grin
,
and
an
oath
of
the
same
quality
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
was
it
,
brother
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
see
,
"
said
Hugh
,
crawling
a
little
nearer
to
him
,
"
that
our
noble
captain
yonder
,
came
in
yesterday
morning
rather
the
worse
for
liquor
,
and
was
---
like
you
and
me
---
<EOS>
ditto
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dennis
looked
to
where
Simon
Tappertit
lay
coiled
upon
a
truss
of
hay
,
snoring
profoundly
,
and
nodded
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
our
noble
captain
,
"
continued
Hugh
with
another
laugh
,
"
<EOS>
our
noble
captain
and
I
,
have
planned
for
to
-
morrow
a
roaring
expedition
,
with
good
profit
in
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Again
the
Papists
?
"
asked
Dennis
,
rubbing
his
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
against
the
Papists
---
against
one
of
'em
at
least
,
that
some
of
us
,
and
I
for
one
,
owe
a
good
heavy
grudge
to
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
Muster
Gashford
's
friend
that
he
spoke
to
us
about
in
my
house
,
eh
?
"
said
Dennis
,
brimfull
of
pleasant
expectation
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
same
man
,
"
said
Hugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
your
sort
,
"
cried
Mr
Dennis
,
gaily
shaking
hands
with
him
,
"
<EOS>
that
's
the
kind
of
game
.
 
<EOS>
Let
's
have
revenges
and
injuries
,
and
all
that
,
and
we
shall
get
on
twice
as
fast
.
 
<EOS>
Now
you
talk
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ha
ha
ha
!
 
<EOS>
The
captain
,
"
added
Hugh
,
"
has
thoughts
of
carrying
off
a
woman
in
the
bustle
,
and
---
ha
ha
ha
!
<EOS>
---
and
so
have
I
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dennis
received
this
part
of
the
scheme
with
a
wry
face
,
observing
that
as
a
general
principle
he
objected
to
women
altogether
,
as
being
unsafe
and
slippery
persons
on
whom
there
was
no
calculating
with
any
certainty
,
and
who
were
never
in
the
same
mind
for
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
at
a
stretch
.
 
<EOS>
He
might
have
expatiated
on
this
suggestive
theme
at
much
greater
length
,
but
that
it
occurred
to
him
to
ask
what
connection
existed
between
the
proposed
expedition
and
Barnaby
's
being
posted
at
the
stable
-
door
as
sentry
;
to
which
Hugh
cautiously
replied
in
these
words
:
  
"
Why
,
the
people
we
mean
to
visit
,
were
friends
of
his
,
once
upon
a
time
,
and
I
know
that
much
of
him
to
feel
pretty
sure
that
if
he
thought
we
were
going
to
do
them
any
harm
,
he
'd
be
no
friend
to
our
side
,
but
would
lend
a
ready
hand
to
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
've
persuaded
him
(
for
I
know
him
of
old
)
that
Lord
George
has
picked
him
out
to
guard
this
place
to
-
morrow
while
we
're
away
,
and
that
it
's
a
great
honour
---
and
so
he
's
on
duty
now
,
<EOS>
and
as
proud
of
it
as
if
he
was
a
general
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
ha
!
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
say
to
me
for
a
careful
man
as
well
as
a
devil
of
a
one
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dennis
exhausted
himself
in
compliments
,
and
then
added
,
  
"
<EOS>
But
about
the
expedition
itself
---
"
  
"
About
that
,
"
said
Hugh
,
"
you
shall
hear
all
particulars
from
me
and
the
great
captain
conjointly
and
both
together
---
for
see
,
he
's
waking
up
.
 
<EOS>
Rouse
yourself
,
lion
-
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
ha
!
 
<EOS>
Put
a
good
face
upon
it
,
and
drink
again
.
 
<EOS>
Another
hair
of
the
dog
that
bit
you
,
captain
!
 
<EOS>
Call
for
drink
!
 
<EOS>
There
's
enough
of
gold
and
silver
cups
and
candlesticks
buried
underneath
my
bed
,
"
he
added
,
rolling
back
the
straw
,
and
pointing
to
where
the
ground
was
newly
turned
,
"
to
pay
for
it
,
if
it
was
a
score
of
casks
full
.
 
<EOS>
Drink
,
captain
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Tappertit
received
these
jovial
promptings
with
a
very
bad
grace
,
being
much
the
worse
,
both
in
mind
and
body
,
for
his
two
nights
of
debauch
,
and
but
indifferently
able
to
stand
upon
his
legs
.
 
<EOS>
With
Hugh
's
assistance
,
however
,
he
contrived
to
stagger
to
the
pump
;
and
having
refreshed
himself
with
an
abundant
draught
of
cold
water
,
and
a
copious
shower
of
the
same
refreshing
liquid
on
his
head
and
face
,
he
ordered
some
rum
and
milk
to
be
served
;
and
upon
that
innocent
beverage
and
some
biscuits
and
cheese
made
a
pretty
hearty
meal
.
 
<EOS>
That
done
,
he
disposed
himself
in
an
easy
attitude
on
the
ground
beside
his
two
companions
(
who
were
carousing
after
their
own
tastes
)
,
and
proceeded
to
enlighten
Mr
Dennis
in
reference
to
to
-
morrow
's
project
.
  
<EOS>
That
their
conversation
was
an
interesting
one
,
was
rendered
manifest
by
its
length
,
and
by
the
close
attention
of
all
three
.
<EOS>
That
it
was
not
of
an
oppressively
grave
character
,
but
was
enlivened
by
various
pleasantries
arising
out
of
the
subject
,
was
clear
from
their
loud
and
frequent
roars
of
laughter
,
which
startled
Barnaby
on
his
post
,
and
made
him
wonder
at
their
levity
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
not
summoned
to
join
them
,
until
they
had
eaten
,
and
drunk
,
and
slept
,
and
talked
together
for
some
hours
;
<EOS>
not
,
indeed
,
until
the
twilight
;
when
they
informed
him
that
they
were
about
to
make
a
slight
demonstration
in
the
streets
---
just
to
keep
the
people
's
hands
in
,
as
it
was
Sunday
night
,
and
the
public
might
otherwise
be
disappointed
---
and
that
he
was
free
to
accompany
them
if
he
would
.
  
<EOS>
Without
the
slightest
preparation
,
saving
that
they
carried
clubs
and
wore
the
blue
cockade
,
they
sallied
out
into
the
streets
;
and
,
with
no
more
settled
design
than
that
of
doing
as
much
mischief
as
they
could
,
paraded
them
at
random
.
 
<EOS>
Their
numbers
rapidly
increasing
,
they
soon
divided
into
parties
;
and
agreeing
to
meet
by
-
and
-
by
,
in
the
fields
near
Welbeck
Street
,
scoured
the
town
in
various
directions
.
 
<EOS>
The
largest
body
,
and
that
which
augmented
with
the
greatest
rapidity
,
was
the
one
to
which
Hugh
and
Barnaby
belonged
.
 
<EOS>
This
took
its
way
towards
Moorfields
,
where
there
was
a
rich
chapel
,
and
in
which
neighbourhood
several
Catholic
families
were
known
to
reside
.
  
<EOS>
Beginning
with
<EOS>
the
private
houses
so
occupied
,
they
broke
open
the
doors
and
windows
;
and
while
they
destroyed
the
furniture
and
left
but
the
bare
walls
,
made
a
sharp
search
for
tools
and
engines
of
destruction
,
such
as
hammers
,
pokers
,
axes
,
saws
,
and
such
like
instruments
.
 
<EOS>
Many
of
the
rioters
made
belts
of
cord
,
of
handkerchiefs
,
or
any
material
they
found
at
hand
,
and
wore
these
weapons
as
openly
as
pioneers
upon
a
field
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
not
the
least
disguise
or
concealment
---
indeed
,
on
this
night
,
very
little
excitement
or
hurry
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
chapels
,
they
tore
down
and
took
away
the
very
altars
,
benches
,
pulpits
,
pews
,
and
flooring
;
from
the
dwelling
-
houses
,
the
very
wainscoting
and
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
This
Sunday
evening
's
recreation
<EOS>
they
pursued
like
mere
workmen
who
had
a
certain
task
to
do
,
and
did
it
.
 
<EOS>
Fifty
resolute
men
might
have
turned
them
at
any
moment
;
a
single
company
of
soldiers
could
have
scattered
them
like
dust
;
but
no
man
interposed
,
no
authority
restrained
them
,
and
,
except
by
the
terrified
persons
who
fled
from
their
approach
,
they
were
as
little
heeded
as
if
they
were
pursuing
their
lawful
occupations
with
the
utmost
sobriety
and
good
conduct
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
same
manner
,
they
marched
to
the
place
of
rendezvous
agreed
upon
,
made
great
fires
in
the
fields
,
and
reserving
the
most
valuable
of
their
spoils
,
burnt
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
Priestly
garments
,
images
of
saints
,
rich
stuffs
and
ornaments
,
altar
-
furniture
and
household
goods
,
were
cast
into
the
flames
,
and
shed
a
glare
on
the
whole
country
round
;
but
they
danced
and
howled
,
and
roared
about
these
fires
till
they
were
tired
,
and
were
never
for
an
instant
checked
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
main
body
filed
off
from
this
scene
of
action
,
and
passed
down
Welbeck
Street
,
they
came
upon
Gashford
,
who
had
been
a
witness
of
their
proceedings
,
and
was
walking
stealthily
along
the
pavement
.
 
<EOS>
Keeping
up
with
him
,
and
yet
not
seeming
to
speak
,
Hugh
muttered
in
his
ear
:
  
"
<EOS>
Is
this
better
,
master
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Gashford
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
would
you
have
?
"
said
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fevers
are
never
at
their
height
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
They
must
get
on
by
degrees
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
have
you
,
"
said
Gashford
,
pinching
his
arm
with
such
malevolence
that
his
nails
seemed
to
meet
in
the
skin
;
"
I
would
have
you
put
some
meaning
into
your
work
.
 
<EOS>
Fools
!
 
<EOS>
Can
you
make
no
better
bonfires
than
of
rags
and
scraps
?
 
<EOS>
Can
you
burn
nothing
whole
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
A
little
patience
,
master
,
"
said
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wait
but
a
few
hours
,
and
you
shall
see
.
 
<EOS>
Look
for
a
redness
in
the
sky
,
to
-
morrow
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
,
he
fell
back
into
his
place
beside
Barnaby
;
and
when
the
secretary
looked
after
him
,
both
were
lost
in
the
crowd
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
53
    
<EOS>
The
next
day
was
ushered
in
by
merry
peals
of
bells
,
and
by
the
firing
of
the
Tower
guns
;
flags
were
hoisted
on
many
of
the
church
-
steeples
;
the
usual
demonstrations
were
made
in
honour
of
the
anniversary
of
the
King
's
birthday
;
and
every
man
went
about
his
pleasure
or
business
as
if
the
city
were
in
perfect
order
,
and
there
were
no
half
-
smouldering
embers
in
its
secret
places
,
which
,
on
the
approach
of
night
,
would
kindle
up
again
and
scatter
ruin
and
dismay
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
The
leaders
of
the
riot
,
rendered
still
more
daring
by
the
success
of
last
night
and
by
the
booty
they
had
acquired
,
kept
steadily
together
,
and
only
thought
of
implicating
the
mass
of
their
followers
so
deeply
that
no
hope
of
pardon
or
reward
might
tempt
them
to
betray
their
more
notorious
confederates
into
the
hands
of
justice
.
  
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
sense
of
having
gone
too
far
to
be
forgiven
,
held
the
timid
together
no
less
than
the
bold
.
 
<EOS>
Many
who
would
readily
have
pointed
out
the
foremost
rioters
and
given
evidence
against
them
,
felt
that
escape
by
that
means
was
hopeless
,
when
their
every
act
had
been
observed
by
scores
of
people
who
had
taken
no
part
in
the
disturbances
;
who
had
suffered
in
their
persons
,
peace
,
or
property
,
by
the
outrages
of
the
mob
;
who
would
be
most
willing
witnesses
;
and
whom
the
government
would
,
no
doubt
,
prefer
to
any
King
's
evidence
that
might
be
offered
.
 
<EOS>
Many
of
this
class
had
deserted
their
usual
occupations
on
the
Saturday
morning
;
some
had
been
seen
by
their
employers
active
in
the
tumult
;
others
knew
they
must
be
suspected
,
and
that
they
would
be
discharged
if
they
returned
;
others
had
been
desperate
from
the
beginning
,
and
comforted
themselves
with
the
homely
proverb
,
that
,
being
hanged
at
all
,
they
might
as
well
be
hanged
for
a
sheep
as
a
lamb
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
hoped
and
believed
,
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
,
that
the
government
they
seemed
to
have
paralysed
,
would
,
in
its
terror
,
come
to
terms
with
them
in
the
end
,
and
suffer
them
to
make
their
own
conditions
.
 
<EOS>
The
least
sanguine
among
them
reasoned
with
himself
that
,
at
the
worst
,
they
were
too
many
to
be
all
punished
,
and
that
he
had
as
good
a
chance
of
escape
as
any
other
man
.
 
<EOS>
The
great
mass
never
reasoned
or
thought
at
all
,
but
were
stimulated
by
their
own
headlong
passions
,
by
poverty
,
by
ignorance
,
by
the
love
of
mischief
,
and
the
hope
of
plunder
.
  
<EOS>
One
other
circumstance
is
worthy
of
remark
;
and
that
is
,
that
from
the
moment
of
their
first
outbreak
at
Westminster
,
every
symptom
of
order
or
preconcerted
arrangement
among
them
vanished
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
divided
into
parties
and
ran
to
different
quarters
of
the
town
,
it
was
on
the
spontaneous
suggestion
of
the
moment
.
 
<EOS>
Each
party
swelled
as
it
went
along
,
like
rivers
as
they
roll
towards
the
sea
;
new
leaders
sprang
up
as
they
were
wanted
,
disappeared
when
the
necessity
was
over
,
and
reappeared
at
the
next
crisis
.
 
<EOS>
Each
tumult
took
shape
and
form
from
the
circumstances
of
the
moment
;
sober
workmen
,
going
home
from
their
day
's
labour
,
were
seen
to
cast
down
their
baskets
of
tools
and
become
rioters
in
an
instant
<EOS>
;
mere
boys
on
errands
did
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
a
moral
plague
ran
through
the
city
.
 
<EOS>
The
noise
,
and
hurry
,
and
excitement
,
had
for
hundreds
and
hundreds
an
attraction
they
had
no
firmness
to
resist
.
 
<EOS>
The
contagion
spread
like
a
dread
fever
:
an
infectious
madness
,
as
yet
not
near
its
height
,
seized
on
new
victims
every
hour
,
and
society
began
to
tremble
at
their
ravings
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
between
two
and
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
when
Gashford
looked
into
the
lair
described
in
the
last
chapter
,
and
seeing
only
Barnaby
and
Dennis
there
,
inquired
for
Hugh
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
out
,
Barnaby
told
him
;
had
gone
out
more
than
an
hour
ago
;
and
had
not
yet
returned
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dennis
!
"
said
the
smiling
secretary
,
in
his
smoothest
voice
,
as
he
sat
down
cross
-
legged
on
a
barrel
,
"
Dennis
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
hangman
struggled
into
a
sitting
posture
directly
,
and
with
his
eyes
wide
open
,
looked
towards
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
,
Dennis
?
"
said
Gashford
,
nodding
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
have
suffered
no
inconvenience
from
your
late
exertions
,
Dennis
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
always
will
say
of
you
,
Muster
Gashford
,
"
returned
the
hangman
,
staring
at
him
,
"
that
that
'
ere
quiet
way
of
yours
might
almost
wake
a
dead
man
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
,
"
he
added
,
with
a
muttered
oath
---
still
staring
at
him
in
a
thoughtful
manner
---
"
so
awful
sly
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
distinct
,
eh
Dennis
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Distinct
!
"
<EOS>
he
answered
,
scratching
his
head
,
and
keeping
his
eyes
upon
the
secretary
's
face
;
"
I
seem
to
hear
it
,
Muster
Gashford
,
in
my
wery
bones
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
glad
your
sense
of
hearing
is
so
sharp
,
and
that
I
succeed
in
making
myself
so
intelligible
,
"
said
Gashford
,
in
his
unvarying
,
even
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
is
your
friend
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dennis
looked
round
as
in
expectation
of
beholding
him
asleep
upon
his
bed
of
straw
;
then
remembering
he
had
seen
him
go
out
,
replied
:
  
"
I
ca
n't
say
where
he
is
,
Muster
Gashford
,
I
expected
him
back
afore
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
it
is
n't
time
that
we
was
busy
,
Muster
Gashford
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
"
said
the
secretary
,
"
who
should
know
that
as
well
as
you
?
<EOS>
How
can
I
tell
you
,
Dennis
?
 
<EOS>
You
are
perfect
master
of
your
own
actions
,
you
know
,
and
accountable
to
nobody
---
except
sometimes
to
the
law
,
eh
?
"
  
<EOS>
Dennis
,
who
was
very
much
baffled
by
the
cool
matter
-
of
-
course
manner
of
this
reply
,
recovered
his
self
-
possession
on
his
professional
pursuits
being
referred
to
,
and
pointing
towards
Barnaby
,
shook
his
head
and
frowned
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
cried
Barnaby
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
Do
hush
about
that
,
Muster
Gashford
,
"
said
the
hangman
in
a
low
voice
,
"
pop'lar
prejudices
<EOS>
---
you
always
forget
---
<EOS>
well
,
Barnaby
,
my
lad
,
what
's
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hear
him
coming
,
"
he
answered
:
"
<EOS>
Hark
!
 
<EOS>
Do
you
mark
that
?
 
<EOS>
That
's
his
foot
!
 
<EOS>
Bless
you
<EOS>
,
I
know
his
step
,
and
his
dog
's
too
.
 
<EOS>
Tramp
,
tramp
,
pit
-
pat
,
on
they
come
together
,
and
,
ha
ha
ha
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
and
here
they
are
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
joyfully
welcoming
Hugh
with
both
hands
,
and
then
patting
him
fondly
on
the
back
,
as
if
instead
of
being
the
rough
companion
he
was
,
he
had
been
one
of
the
most
prepossessing
of
men
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
he
is
,
and
safe
too
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
to
see
him
back
again
,
old
Hugh
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
Turk
if
he
do
n't
give
me
a
warmer
welcome
always
than
any
man
of
sense
,
"
said
Hugh
,
shaking
hands
with
him
with
a
kind
of
ferocious
friendship
,
strange
enough
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
are
you
,
boy
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hearty
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Barnaby
,
waving
his
hat
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
ha
ha
!
 
<EOS>
And
merrry
too
,
Hugh
!
 
<EOS>
And
ready
to
do
anything
for
the
good
cause
,
and
the
right
,
and
to
help
the
kind
,
mild
,
pale
-
faced
gentleman
---
the
lord
they
used
<EOS>
so
ill
---
eh
,
Hugh
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
"
returned
his
friend
,
dropping
his
hand
,
and
looking
at
Gashford
for
an
instant
with
a
changed
expression
before
he
spoke
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
day
,
master
!
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
good
day
to
you
,
"
replied
the
secretary
,
nursing
his
leg
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
many
good
days
---
whole
years
of
them
,
I
hope
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
heated
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
would
you
have
been
,
master
,
"
said
Hugh
,
wiping
his
face
,
"
if
you
'd
been
running
here
as
fast
as
I
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
the
news
,
then
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
supposed
you
would
have
heard
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
News
!
<EOS>
what
news
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Gashford
,
raising
his
eyebrows
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
 
<EOS>
Come
;
then
I
AM
the
first
to
make
you
acquainted
with
your
distinguished
position
,
after
all
.
<EOS>
Do
you
see
the
King
's
Arms
a
-
top
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
smilingly
asked
,
as
he
took
a
large
paper
from
his
pocket
,
unfolded
it
,
and
held
it
out
for
Hugh
's
inspection
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Much
.
 
<EOS>
A
great
deal
,
"
replied
the
secretary
.
 
<EOS>
"
Read
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
,
the
first
time
I
saw
you
,
that
I
could
n't
read
,
"
said
Hugh
,
impatiently
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
in
the
Devil
's
name
's
inside
of
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
proclamation
from
the
King
in
Council
,
"
said
Gashford
,
"
dated
to
-
day
,
and
offering
a
reward
of
five
hundred
pounds
---
five
hundred
pounds
is
a
great
deal
of
money
,
and
a
large
temptation
to
some
people
---
to
any
one
who
will
discover
the
person
or
persons
most
active
in
demolishing
those
chapels
on
Saturday
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
all
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Hugh
,
with
an
indifferent
air
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
knew
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Truly
I
might
have
known
you
did
,
"
said
Gashford
,
smiling
,
and
folding
up
the
document
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
friend
,
I
might
have
guessed
---
 
indeed
I
did
guess
---
was
sure
to
tell
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
friend
!
"
stammered
Hugh
,
with
an
unsuccessful
effort
to
appear
surprised
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
friend
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tut
tut
<EOS>
---
do
you
suppose
I
do
n't
know
where
you
have
been
?
"
<EOS>
retorted
Gashford
,
rubbing
his
hands
,
and
beating
the
back
of
one
on
the
palm
of
the
other
,
and
looking
at
him
with
a
cunning
eye
.
<EOS>
"
How
dull
you
think
me
!
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
say
his
name
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Hugh
,
with
a
hasty
glance
towards
Dennis
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
also
heard
from
him
,
no
doubt
,
"
resumed
the
secretary
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
"
that
the
rioters
who
have
been
taken
(
poor
fellows
)
are
committed
for
trial
,
and
that
some
very
active
witnesses
have
had
the
temerity
to
appear
against
them
.
 
<EOS>
Among
others
---
"
and
here
he
clenched
his
teeth
,
as
if
he
would
suppress
by
force
some
violent
words
that
rose
upon
his
tongue
;
and
spoke
very
slowly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Among
others
,
a
gentleman
who
saw
the
work
going
on
in
Warwick
Street
;
a
Catholic
gentleman
;
one
Haredale
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
would
have
prevented
his
uttering
the
word
,
but
it
was
out
already
.
 
<EOS>
Hearing
the
name
,
Barnaby
turned
swiftly
round
.
  
<EOS>
"
Duty
,
duty
,
bold
Barnaby
!
"
cried
Hugh
,
assuming
his
wildest
and
most
rapid
manner
,
and
thrusting
into
his
hand
his
staff
and
flag
which
leant
against
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mount
guard
without
loss
of
time
,
for
we
are
off
upon
our
expedition
.
 
<EOS>
Up
,
Dennis
,
and
get
ready
!
<EOS>
Take
care
that
no
one
turns
the
straw
upon
my
bed
,
brave
Barnaby
;
we
know
what
's
underneath
it
---
eh
?
 
<EOS>
Now
,
master
,
quick
!
 
<EOS>
What
you
have
to
say
,
say
speedily
,
for
the
little
captain
and
a
cluster
of
'em
are
in
the
fields
,
and
only
waiting
for
us
.
 
<EOS>
Sharp
's
the
word
,
and
strike
's
the
action
.
 
<EOS>
Quick
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Barnaby
was
not
proof
against
this
bustle
and
despatch
.
 
<EOS>
The
look
of
mingled
astonishtnent
and
anger
which
had
appeared
in
his
face
when
he
turned
towards
them
,
faded
from
it
as
the
words
passed
from
his
memory
,
like
breath
from
a
polished
mirror
;
and
grasping
the
weapon
which
Hugh
forced
upon
him
,
he
proudly
took
his
station
at
the
door
,
beyond
their
hearing
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
might
have
spoiled
our
plans
,
master
,
"
said
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
YOU
,
too
,
of
all
men
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
would
have
supposed
that
HE
would
be
so
quick
?
"
urged
Gashford
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
as
quick
sometimes
---
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mean
with
his
hands
,
for
that
you
know
,
but
with
his
head
---
as
you
or
any
man
,
"
said
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dennis
,
it
's
time
we
were
going
;
they
're
waiting
for
us
;
I
came
to
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
Reach
me
my
stick
and
belt
.
 
<EOS>
Here
!
 
<EOS>
Lend
a
hand
,
master
.
<EOS>
Fling
this
over
my
shoulder
,
and
buckle
it
behind
,
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Brisk
as
ever
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
secretary
,
adjusting
it
for
him
as
he
desired
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
man
need
be
brisk
to
-
day
;
there
's
brisk
work
a
-
foot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
,
is
there
?
"
said
Gashford
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
it
with
such
a
provoking
assumption
of
ignorance
,
that
Hugh
,
looking
over
his
shoulder
and
angrily
down
upon
him
,
replied
:
  
"
Is
there
!
 
<EOS>
You
know
there
is
!
 
<EOS>
Who
knows
better
than
you
,
master
,
that
the
first
great
step
to
be
taken
is
to
make
examples
of
these
witnesses
,
and
frighten
all
men
from
appearing
against
us
or
any
of
our
body
,
any
more
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
one
we
know
of
,
"
returned
Gashford
,
with
an
expressive
smile
,
"
who
is
at
least
as
well
informed
upon
that
subject
as
you
or
I.
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
we
mean
the
same
gentleman
,
as
I
suppose
we
do
,
"
Hugh
rejoined
softly
,
"
I
tell
you
this
<EOS>
---
he
's
as
good
and
quick
information
about
everything
as
---
<EOS>
"
here
he
paused
and
looked
round
,
as
if
to
make
sure
that
the
person
in
question
was
not
within
hearing
,
"
as
Old
Nick
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
done
that
,
master
?
 
<EOS>
How
slow
you
are
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
quite
fast
now
,
"
said
Gashford
,
rising
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
say
---
<EOS>
you
did
n't
find
that
your
friend
disapproved
of
to
-
day
's
little
expedition
?
<EOS>
Ha
ha
ha
!
 
<EOS>
It
is
fortunate
it
jumps
so
well
with
the
witness
policy
;
for
,
once
planned
,
it
must
have
been
carried
out
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
you
are
going
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
we
are
going
,
master
!
"
<EOS>
Hugh
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
Any
parting
words
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
,
no
,
"
said
Gashford
sweetly
.
 
<EOS>
"
None
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
sure
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Hugh
,
nudging
the
grinning
Dennis
.
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
sure
,
eh
,
Muster
Gashford
?
"
chuckled
the
hangman
.
  
<EOS>
Gashford
paused
a
moment
,
struggling
with
his
caution
and
his
malice
;
then
putting
himself
between
the
two
men
,
and
laying
a
hand
upon
the
arm
of
each
,
said
,
in
a
cramped
whisper
:
  
"
Do
not
,
my
good
friends
<EOS>
---
I
am
sure
you
will
not
---
forget
our
talk
one
night
---
in
your
house
,
Dennis
---
about
this
person
.
 
<EOS>
No
mercy
,
no
quarter
<EOS>
,
no
two
beams
of
his
house
to
be
left
standing
where
the
builder
placed
them
!
 
<EOS>
Fire
,
the
saying
goes
,
is
a
good
servant
,
but
a
bad
master
.
 
<EOS>
Makes
it
HIS
master
;
he
deserves
no
better
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
sure
you
will
be
firm
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
you
will
be
very
resolute
,
I
am
sure
you
will
remember
that
he
thirsts
for
your
lives
,
and
those
of
all
your
brave
companions
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
ever
acted
like
staunch
fellows
,
you
will
do
so
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
Wo
n't
you
,
Dennis
---
wo
n't
you
,
Hugh
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
two
looked
at
him
,
and
at
each
other
;
then
bursting
into
a
roar
of
laughter
,
brandished
their
staves
above
their
heads
,
shook
hands
,
and
hurried
out
.
  
<EOS>
When
they
had
been
gone
a
little
time
,
Gashford
followed
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
yet
in
sight
,
and
hastening
to
that
part
of
the
adjacent
fields
in
which
their
fellows
had
already
mustered
;
Hugh
was
looking
back
,
and
flourishing
his
hat
to
Barnaby
,
who
,
delighted
with
his
trust
,
replied
in
the
same
way
,
and
then
resumed
his
pacing
up
and
down
before
the
stable
-
door
,
where
his
feet
had
worn
a
path
already
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
Gashford
himself
was
far
distant
,
and
looked
back
for
the
last
time
,
he
was
still
walking
to
and
fro
,
with
the
same
measured
tread
;
the
most
devoted
and
the
blithest
champion
that
ever
maintained
a
post
,
and
felt
his
heart
lifted
up
with
a
brave
sense
of
duty
,
and
determination
to
defend
it
to
the
last
.
  
<EOS>
Smiling
at
the
simplicity
of
the
poor
idiot
,
Gashford
betook
himself
to
Welbeck
Street
by
a
different
path
from
that
which
he
knew
the
rioters
would
take
,
and
sitting
down
behind
a
curtain
in
one
of
the
upper
windows
of
Lord
George
Gordon
's
house
,
waited
impatiently
for
their
coming
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
so
long
,
that
although
he
knew
it
had
been
settled
they
should
come
that
way
,
he
had
a
misgiving
they
must
have
changed
their
plans
and
taken
some
other
route
.
 
<EOS>
But
at
length
the
roar
of
voices
was
heard
in
the
neighbouring
fields
,
and
soon
afterwards
they
came
thronging
past
,
in
a
great
body
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
they
were
not
all
,
nor
nearly
all
,
in
one
body
,
but
were
,
as
he
soon
found
,
divided
into
four
parties
,
each
of
which
stopped
before
the
house
to
give
three
cheers
,
and
then
went
on
;
the
leaders
crying
out
in
what
direction
they
were
going
,
and
calling
on
the
spectators
to
join
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
detachment
,
carrying
,
by
way
of
banners
,
some
relics
of
the
havoc
they
had
made
in
Moorfields
,
proclaimed
that
they
were
on
their
way
to
Chelsea
,
whence
they
would
return
in
the
same
order
,
to
make
of
the
spoil
they
bore
,
a
great
bonfire
,
near
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
The
second
gave
out
that
they
were
bound
for
Wapping
,
to
destroy
a
chapel
;
the
third
,
that
their
place
of
destination
was
East
Smithfield
,
and
their
object
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
was
done
in
broad
,
bright
,
summer
day
.
 
<EOS>
Gay
carriages
and
chairs
stopped
to
let
them
pass
,
or
turned
back
to
avoid
them
;
people
on
foot
stood
aside
in
doorways
,
or
perhaps
knocked
and
begged
permission
to
stand
at
a
window
,
or
in
the
hall
,
until
the
rioters
had
passed
:
but
nobody
interfered
with
them
;
and
when
they
had
gone
by
,
everything
went
on
as
usual
.
  
<EOS>
There
still
remained
the
fourth
body
,
and
for
that
the
secretary
looked
with
a
most
intense
eagerness
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
it
came
up
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
numerous
,
and
composed
of
picked
men
;
for
as
he
gazed
down
among
them
,
he
recognised
many
upturned
faces
which
he
knew
well
---
those
of
Simon
Tappertit
,
Hugh
,
and
Dennis
in
the
front
,
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
They
halted
and
cheered
,
as
the
others
had
done
;
but
when
they
moved
again
,
they
did
not
,
like
them
,
proclaim
what
design
they
had
.
<EOS>
Hugh
merely
raised
his
hat
upon
the
bludgeon
he
carried
,
and
glancing
at
a
spectator
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
,
was
gone
.
  
<EOS>
Gashford
followed
the
direction
of
his
glance
instinctively
,
and
saw
,
standing
on
the
pavement
,
and
wearing
the
blue
cockade
,
Sir
John
Chester
.
 
<EOS>
He
held
his
hat
an
inch
or
two
above
his
head
,
to
propitiate
the
mob
;
and
,
resting
gracefully
on
his
cane
,
smiling
pleasantly
,
and
displaying
his
dress
and
person
to
the
very
best
advantage
,
looked
on
in
the
most
tranquil
state
imaginable
.
 
<EOS>
For
all
that
,
and
quick
and
dexterous
as
he
was
,
Gashford
had
seen
him
recognise
Hugh
with
the
air
of
a
patron
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
no
longer
any
eyes
for
the
crowd
,
but
fixed
his
keen
regards
upon
Sir
John
.
  
<EOS>
He
stood
in
the
same
place
and
posture
until
the
last
man
in
the
concourse
had
turned
the
corner
of
the
street
;
then
very
deliberately
took
the
blue
cockade
out
of
his
hat
;
put
it
carefully
in
his
pocket
,
ready
for
the
next
emergency
;
refreshed
himself
with
a
pinch
of
snuff
;
put
up
his
box
;
and
was
walking
slowly
off
,
when
a
passing
carriage
stopped
,
and
a
lady
's
hand
let
down
the
glass
.
<EOS>
Sir
John
's
hat
was
off
again
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
minute
's
conversation
at
the
carriage
-
window
,
in
which
it
was
apparent
that
he
was
vastly
entertaining
on
the
subject
of
the
mob
,
he
stepped
lightly
in
,
and
was
driven
away
.
  
<EOS>
The
secretary
smiled
,
but
he
had
other
thoughts
to
dwell
upon
,
and
soon
dismissed
the
topic
.
 
<EOS>
Dinner
was
brought
him
,
but
he
sent
it
down
untasted
;
and
,
in
restless
pacings
up
and
down
the
room
,
and
constant
glances
at
the
clock
,
and
many
futile
efforts
to
sit
down
and
read
,
or
go
to
sleep
,
or
look
out
of
the
window
,
consumed
four
weary
hours
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
dial
told
him
thus
much
time
had
crept
away
,
he
stole
upstairs
to
the
top
of
the
house
,
and
coming
out
upon
the
roof
sat
down
,
with
his
face
towards
the
east
.
  
<EOS>
Heedless
of
the
fresh
air
that
blew
upon
his
heated
brow
,
of
the
pleasant
meadows
from
which
he
turned
,
of
the
piles
of
roofs
and
chimneys
upon
which
he
looked
,
of
the
smoke
and
rising
mist
he
vainly
sought
to
pierce
,
of
the
shrill
cries
of
children
at
their
evening
sports
,
<EOS>
the
distant
hum
and
turmoil
of
the
town
,
the
cheerful
country
breath
that
rustled
past
to
meet
it
,
and
to
droop
,
and
die
;
he
watched
,
and
watched
,
till
it
was
dark
save
for
the
specks
of
light
that
twinkled
in
the
streets
below
and
far
away
---
 
and
,
as
the
darkness
deepened
,
strained
his
gaze
and
grew
more
eager
yet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
but
gloom
in
that
direction
,
still
!
"
he
muttered
restlessly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dog
!
<EOS>
where
is
the
redness
in
the
sky
,
you
promised
me
!

Chapter
54
    
Rumours
of
the
prevailing
disturbances
had
,
by
this
time
,
begun
to
be
pretty
generally
circulated
through
the
towns
and
villages
round
London
,
and
the
tidings
were
everywhere
received
with
that
appetite
for
the
marvellous
and
love
of
the
terrible
which
have
probably
been
among
the
natural
characteristics
of
mankind
since
the
creation
of
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
These
accounts
,
however
,
appeared
,
to
many
persons
at
that
day
---
as
they
would
to
us
at
the
present
,
but
that
we
know
them
to
be
matter
of
history
---
so
monstrous
and
improbable
,
that
a
great
number
of
those
who
were
resident
at
a
distance
,
and
who
were
credulous
enough
on
other
points
,
were
really
unable
to
bring
their
minds
to
believe
that
such
things
could
be
;
and
rejected
the
intelligence
they
received
on
all
hands
,
as
wholly
fabulous
and
absurd
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Willet
---
not
so
much
,
perhaps
,
on
account
of
his
having
argued
and
settled
the
matter
with
himself
,
as
by
reason
of
his
constitutional
obstinacy
---
was
one
of
those
who
positively
refused
to
entertain
the
current
topic
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
On
this
very
evening
,
and
perhaps
at
the
very
time
when
Gashford
kept
his
solitary
watch
,
old
John
was
so
red
in
the
face
with
perpetually
shaking
his
head
in
contradiction
of
his
three
ancient
cronies
and
pot
companions
,
that
he
was
quite
a
phenomenon
to
behold
,
and
lighted
up
the
Maypole
Porch
<EOS>
wherein
they
sat
together
,
like
a
monstrous
carbuncle
in
a
fairy
tale
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Willet
,
looking
hard
at
Solomon
Daisy
---
for
it
was
his
custom
in
cases
of
personal
altercation
to
fasten
upon
the
smallest
man
in
the
party
---
"
do
you
think
,
sir
,
that
I
'm
a
born
fool
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
no
,
Johnny
,
"
returned
Solomon
,
looking
round
upon
the
little
circle
of
which
he
formed
a
part
:
"
We
all
know
better
than
that
.
<EOS>
You
're
no
fool
,
Johnny
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Cobb
and
Mr
Parkes
shook
their
heads
in
unison
,
muttering
,
"
No
,
no
,
Johnny
,
not
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
as
such
compliments
had
usually
the
effect
of
making
Mr
Willet
rather
more
dogged
than
before
,
he
surveyed
them
with
a
look
of
deep
disdain
,
and
returned
for
answer
:
  
"
<EOS>
Then
what
do
you
mean
by
coming
here
,
and
telling
me
that
this
evening
you
're
a
-
going
to
walk
up
to
London
together
---
you
three
---
 
you
---
and
have
the
evidence
of
your
own
senses
?
 
<EOS>
An't
,
"
said
Mr
Willet
,
putting
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
with
an
air
of
solemn
disgust
,
"
<EOS>
an't
<EOS>
the
evidence
of
MY
senses
enough
for
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
we
have
n't
got
it
,
Johnny
,
"
pleaded
Parkes
,
humbly
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
n't
got
it
,
sir
?
"
repeated
Mr
Willet
,
eyeing
him
from
top
to
toe
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
n't
got
it
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
You
HAVE
got
it
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
I
tell
you
that
His
blessed
Majesty
King
George
the
Third
would
no
more
stand
a
rioting
and
rollicking
in
his
streets
,
than
he
'd
stand
being
crowed
over
by
his
own
Parliament
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
Johnny
,
but
that
's
your
sense
---
not
your
senses
,
"
said
the
adventurous
Mr
Parkes
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
know
?
 
<EOS>
"
retorted
John
with
great
dignity
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
contradicting
pretty
free
,
you
are
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
How
do
YOU
know
which
it
is
?
 
<EOS>
I
'm
not
aware
I
ever
told
you
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Parkes
,
finding
himself
in
the
position
of
having
got
into
metaphysics
without
exactly
seeing
his
way
out
of
them
,
stammered
forth
an
apology
and
retreated
from
the
argument
.
 
<EOS>
There
then
ensued
a
silence
of
some
ten
minutes
or
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
at
the
expiration
of
which
period
<EOS>
Mr
Willet
was
observed
to
rumble
and
shake
with
laughter
,
and
presently
remarked
,
in
reference
to
his
late
adversary
,
"
that
he
hoped
he
had
tackled
him
enough
.
"
<EOS>
Thereupon
Messrs
Cobb
and
Daisy
laughed
,
and
nodded
,
and
Parkes
was
looked
upon
as
thoroughly
and
effectually
put
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
suppose
if
all
this
was
true
,
that
Mr
Haredale
would
be
constantly
away
from
home
,
as
he
is
?
"
said
John
,
after
another
silence
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
he
would
n't
be
afraid
to
leave
his
house
with
them
two
young
women
in
it
,
and
only
a
couple
of
men
,
or
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
but
then
you
know
,
"
returned
Solomon
Daisy
,
"
his
house
is
a
goodish
way
out
of
London
,
and
they
do
say
that
the
rioters
wo
n't
go
more
than
two
miles
,
or
three
at
the
farthest
,
off
the
stones
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
you
know
,
some
of
the
Catholic
gentlefolks
have
actually
sent
trinkets
and
suchlike
down
here
for
safety
---
at
least
,
so
the
story
goes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
story
goes
!
"
said
Mr
Willet
testily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
The
story
goes
that
you
saw
a
ghost
last
March
.
 
<EOS>
But
nobody
believes
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
!
"
said
Solomon
,
rising
,
to
divert
the
attention
of
his
two
friends
,
who
tittered
at
this
retort
:
"
believed
or
disbelieved
,
it
's
true
;
and
true
or
not
,
if
we
mean
to
go
to
London
,
we
must
be
going
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
So
shake
hands
,
Johnny
,
and
good
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
shake
hands
,
"
returned
the
landlord
,
putting
his
into
his
pockets
,
"
with
no
man
as
goes
to
London
on
such
nonsensical
errands
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
three
cronies
were
therefore
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
shaking
his
elbows
;
having
performed
that
ceremony
,
and
brought
from
the
house
their
hats
,
and
sticks
,
and
greatcoats
,
they
bade
him
good
night
and
departed
;
promising
to
bring
him
on
the
morrow
full
and
true
accounts
of
the
real
state
of
the
city
,
and
if
it
were
quiet
,
to
give
him
the
full
merit
of
his
victory
.
  
<EOS>
John
Willet
looked
after
them
,
as
they
plodded
along
the
road
in
the
rich
glow
of
a
summer
evening
;
and
knocking
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
,
laughed
inwardly
at
their
folly
,
until
his
sides
were
sore
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
quite
exhausted
himself
---
which
took
some
time
,
for
he
laughed
as
slowly
as
he
thought
and
spoke
---
he
sat
himself
comfortably
with
his
back
to
the
house
,
put
his
legs
upon
the
bench
,
then
his
apron
over
his
face
,
and
fell
sound
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
How
long
he
slept
,
matters
not
;
but
it
was
for
no
brief
space
,
for
when
he
awoke
,
the
rich
light
had
faded
<EOS>
,
the
sombre
hues
of
night
were
falling
fast
upon
the
landscape
,
and
a
few
bright
stars
were
already
twinkling
overhead
.
 
<EOS>
The
birds
were
all
at
roost
,
the
daisies
on
the
green
had
closed
their
fairy
hoods
,
the
honeysuckle
twining
round
the
porch
exhaled
its
perfume
in
a
twofold
degree
,
as
though
it
lost
its
coyness
at
that
silent
time
and
loved
to
shed
its
fragrance
on
the
night
;
the
ivy
scarcely
stirred
its
deep
green
leaves
.
 
<EOS>
How
tranquil
,
and
how
beautiful
it
was
!
  
<EOS>
Was
there
no
sound
in
the
air
,
besides
the
gentle
rustling
of
the
trees
and
the
grasshopper
's
merry
chirp
?
 
<EOS>
Hark
!
 
<EOS>
Something
very
faint
and
distant
,
not
unlike
the
murmuring
in
a
sea
-
shell
.
 
<EOS>
Now
it
grew
louder
,
fainter
now
,
and
now
it
altogether
died
away
.
<EOS>
Presently
,
it
came
again
,
subsided
,
came
once
more
,
grew
louder
,
fainter
---
swelled
into
a
roar
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
on
the
road
,
and
varied
with
its
windings
.
 
<EOS>
All
at
once
it
burst
into
a
distinct
sound
---
the
voices
,
and
the
tramping
feet
of
many
men
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
questionable
whether
old
John
Willet
,
even
then
,
would
have
thought
of
the
rioters
but
for
the
cries
of
his
cook
and
housemaid
,
who
ran
screaming
upstairs
and
locked
themselves
into
one
of
the
old
garrets
,
---
shrieking
dismally
when
they
had
done
so
,
by
way
of
rendering
their
place
of
refuge
perfectly
secret
and
secure
.
 
<EOS>
These
two
females
did
afterwards
depone
that
Mr
Willet
in
his
consternation
uttered
but
one
word
,
and
called
that
up
the
stairs
in
a
stentorian
voice
,
six
distinct
times
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
this
word
was
a
monosyllable
,
which
,
however
inoffensive
when
applied
to
the
quadruped
it
denotes
,
is
highly
reprehensible
when
used
in
connection
with
females
of
unimpeachable
character
,
many
persons
were
inclined
to
believe
that
the
young
women
laboured
under
some
hallucination
caused
by
excessive
fear
;
and
that
their
ears
deceived
them
.
  
<EOS>
Be
this
as
it
may
,
John
Willet
,
in
whom
the
very
uttermost
extent
of
dull
-
headed
perplexity
supplied
the
place
of
courage
,
stationed
himself
in
the
porch
,
and
waited
for
their
coming
up
.
 
<EOS>
Once
,
it
dimly
occurred
to
him
that
there
was
a
kind
of
door
to
the
house
,
which
had
a
lock
and
bolts
;
and
at
the
same
time
some
shadowy
ideas
of
shutters
to
the
lower
windows
,
flitted
through
his
brain
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
stood
stock
still
,
looking
down
the
road
in
the
direction
in
which
the
noise
was
rapidly
advancing
,
and
did
not
so
much
as
take
his
hands
out
of
his
pockets
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
not
to
wait
long
.
 
<EOS>
A
dark
mass
,
looming
through
a
cloud
of
dust
,
soon
became
visible
;
the
mob
quickened
their
pace
;
shouting
and
whooping
like
savages
,
they
came
rushing
on
pell
mell
;
and
in
a
few
seconds
he
was
bandied
from
hand
to
hand
,
in
the
heart
of
a
crowd
of
men
.
  
<EOS>
"
Halloa
!
"
cried
a
voice
he
knew
,
as
the
man
who
spoke
came
cleaving
through
the
throng
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
is
he
?
 
<EOS>
Give
him
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
hurt
him
.
 
<EOS>
How
now
,
old
Jack
!
 
<EOS>
Ha
ha
ha
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Willet
looked
at
him
,
and
saw
it
was
Hugh
;
but
he
said
nothing
,
and
thought
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
These
lads
are
thirsty
and
must
drink
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Hugh
,
thrusting
him
back
towards
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bustle
,
Jack
,
bustle
.
 
<EOS>
Show
us
the
best
---
 
the
very
best
---
the
over
-
proof
that
you
keep
for
your
own
drinking
,
Jack
!
"
  
<EOS>
John
faintly
articulated
the
words
,
"
Who
's
to
pay
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
says
"
Who
's
to
pay
?
"
<EOS>
"
cried
Hugh
,
with
a
roar
of
laughter
which
was
loudly
echoed
by
the
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
Then
turning
to
John
,
he
added
,
"
Pay
!
<EOS>
Why
,
nobody
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
John
stared
round
at
the
mass
of
faces
---
some
grinning
,
<EOS>
some
fierce
,
some
lighted
up
by
torches
,
some
indistinct
,
some
dusky
and
shadowy
:
<EOS>
some
looking
at
him
,
some
at
his
house
,
some
at
each
other
---
and
while
he
was
,
as
he
thought
,
in
the
very
act
of
doing
so
,
found
himself
,
without
any
consciousness
of
having
moved
,
in
the
bar
;
sitting
down
in
an
arm
-
chair
,
and
watching
the
destruction
of
his
property
,
as
if
it
were
some
queer
play
or
entertainment
,
of
an
astonishing
and
stupefying
nature
,
but
having
no
reference
to
himself
---
that
he
could
make
out
---
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
Here
was
the
bar
---
the
bar
that
the
boldest
never
entered
without
special
invitation
---
the
sanctuary
,
the
mystery
,
the
hallowed
ground
:
here
it
was
,
crammed
with
men
,
clubs
,
sticks
,
torches
,
pistols
;
filled
with
a
deafening
noise
,
oaths
,
shouts
,
screams
,
hootings
;
changed
all
at
once
into
a
bear
-
garden
,
a
madhouse
,
an
infernal
temple
:
<EOS>
men
darting
in
and
out
,
by
door
and
window
,
smashing
the
glass
,
turning
the
taps
,
drinking
liquor
out
of
China
punchbowls
,
sitting
astride
of
casks
,
smoking
private
and
personal
pipes
,
cutting
down
the
sacred
grove
of
lemons
,
hacking
and
hewing
at
the
celebrated
cheese
,
breaking
open
inviolable
drawers
,
putting
things
in
their
pockets
which
did
n't
belong
to
them
,
dividing
his
own
money
before
his
own
eyes
,
wantonly
wasting
,
breaking
,
pulling
down
and
tearing
up
:
nothing
quiet
,
nothing
private
:
men
everywhere
---
above
,
below
,
overhead
,
in
the
bedrooms
,
in
the
kitchen
,
in
the
yard
,
in
the
stables
---
clambering
in
at
windows
when
there
were
doors
wide
open
;
dropping
out
of
windows
when
the
stairs
were
handy
;
leaping
over
the
bannisters
into
chasms
of
passages
:
new
faces
and
figures
presenting
themselves
every
instant
---
some
yelling
,
some
singing
,
some
fighting
,
some
breaking
glass
and
crockery
,
some
laying
the
dust
with
the
liquor
they
could
n't
drink
,
some
ringing
the
bells
till
they
pulled
them
down
,
others
beating
them
with
pokers
till
they
beat
them
into
fragments
:
more
men
still
---
more
,
more
,
more
---
swarming
on
like
insects
:
<EOS>
noise
,
smoke
,
light
,
darkness
,
frolic
,
anger
,
laughter
,
groans
,
plunder
,
fear
,
and
ruin
!
  
<EOS>
Nearly
all
the
time
while
John
looked
on
at
this
bewildering
scene
,
Hugh
kept
near
him
;
and
though
he
was
the
loudest
,
wildest
,
most
destructive
villain
there
,
he
saved
his
old
master
's
bones
a
score
of
times
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
even
when
Mr
Tappertit
,
excited
by
liquor
,
came
up
,
and
in
assertion
of
his
prerogative
politely
kicked
John
Willet
on
the
shins
,
Hugh
bade
him
return
the
compliment
;
and
if
old
John
had
had
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
understand
this
whispered
direction
,
and
to
profit
by
it
,
he
might
no
doubt
,
under
Hugh
's
protection
,
have
done
so
with
impunity
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
the
band
began
to
reassemble
outside
the
house
,
and
to
call
to
those
within
,
to
join
them
,
for
they
were
losing
time
.
<EOS>
These
murmurs
increasing
,
and
attaining
a
high
pitch
,
Hugh
,
and
some
of
those
who
yet
lingered
in
the
bar
,
and
who
plainly
were
the
leaders
of
the
troop
,
took
counsel
together
,
apart
,
as
to
what
was
to
be
done
with
John
,
to
keep
him
quiet
until
their
Chigwell
work
was
over
.
 
<EOS>
Some
proposed
to
set
the
house
on
fire
and
leave
him
in
it
;
others
,
that
he
should
be
reduced
to
a
state
of
temporary
insensibility
,
by
knocking
on
the
head
;
others
,
that
he
should
be
sworn
to
sit
where
he
was
until
to
-
morrow
at
the
same
hour
;
others
again
,
that
he
should
be
gagged
and
taken
off
with
them
,
under
a
sufficient
guard
.
 
<EOS>
All
these
propositions
being
overruled
,
it
was
concluded
,
at
last
,
to
bind
him
in
his
chair
,
and
the
word
was
passed
for
Dennis
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look'ee
here
,
Jack
!
"
said
Hugh
,
striding
up
to
him
:
"
We
are
going
to
tie
you
,
hand
and
foot
,
but
otherwise
you
wo
n't
be
hurt
.
 
<EOS>
D'ye
hear
?
"
  
<EOS>
John
Willet
looked
at
another
man
,
as
if
he
did
n't
know
which
was
the
speaker
,
and
muttered
something
about
an
ordinary
every
Sunday
at
two
o'clock
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
be
hurt
<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
Jack
---
<EOS>
do
you
hear
me
?
"
<EOS>
roared
Hugh
,
impressing
the
assurance
upon
him
by
means
of
a
heavy
blow
on
the
back
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
's
so
dead
scared
,
he
's
woolgathering
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
Give
him
a
drop
of
something
to
drink
here
.
 
<EOS>
Hand
over
,
one
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
glass
of
liquor
being
passed
forward
,
Hugh
poured
the
contents
down
old
John
's
throat
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Willet
feebly
smacked
his
lips
,
thrust
his
hand
into
his
pocket
,
and
inquired
what
was
to
pay
;
adding
,
as
he
looked
vacantly
round
,
that
he
believed
there
was
a
trifle
of
broken
glass
---
   
<EOS>
"
He
's
out
of
his
senses
for
the
time
,
it
's
my
belief
,
"
said
Hugh
,
after
shaking
him
,
without
any
visible
effect
upon
his
system
,
until
his
keys
rattled
in
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
's
that
Dennis
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
word
was
again
passed
,
and
presently
Mr
Dennis
,
with
a
long
cord
bound
about
his
middle
,
something
after
the
manner
of
a
friar
,
came
hurrying
in
,
attended
by
a
body
-
guard
of
half
-
a
-
dozen
of
his
men
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
!
 
<EOS>
Be
alive
here
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Hugh
,
stamping
his
foot
upon
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
"
Make
haste
!
"
  
<EOS>
Dennis
,
with
a
wink
and
a
nod
,
unwound
the
cord
from
about
his
person
,
and
raising
his
eyes
to
the
ceiling
,
looked
all
over
it
,
and
round
the
walls
and
cornice
,
with
a
curious
eye
;
then
shook
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Move
,
man
,
ca
n't
you
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Hugh
,
with
another
impatient
stamp
of
his
foot
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
we
to
wait
here
,
<EOS>
till
the
cry
has
gone
for
ten
miles
round
,
and
our
work
's
interrupted
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
very
fine
talking
,
brother
,
"
answered
Dennis
,
stepping
towards
him
;
"
but
unless
---
"
and
here
he
whispered
in
his
ear
---
 
"
unless
we
do
it
over
the
door
,
it
ca
n't
be
done
at
all
in
this
here
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
ca
n't
?
"
<EOS>
Hugh
demanded
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
ca
n't
!
"
<EOS>
retorted
Dennis
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
the
old
man
ca
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
were
n't
going
to
hang
him
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Hugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
brother
?
"
returned
the
hangman
with
a
stare
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
else

"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
made
no
answer
,
but
snatching
the
rope
from
his
companion
's
hand
,
proceeded
to
bind
old
John
himself
;
but
his
very
first
move
was
so
bungling
and
unskilful
,
that
Mr
Dennis
entreated
,
almost
with
tears
in
his
eyes
,
that
he
might
be
permitted
to
perform
the
duty
.
 
<EOS>
Hugh
consenting
,
be
achieved
it
in
a
twinkling
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
"
he
said
,
looking
mournfully
at
John
Willet
,
who
displayed
no
more
emotion
in
his
bonds
than
he
had
shown
out
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
what
I
call
pretty
and
workmanlike
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
quite
a
picter
now
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
brother
,
just
a
word
with
you
---
now
that
he
's
ready
trussed
,
as
one
may
say
,
would
n't
it
be
better
for
all
parties
if
we
was
to
work
him
off
?
 
<EOS>
It
would
read
uncommon
well
in
the
newspapers
,
it
would
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
The
public
would
think
a
great
deal
more
on
us
!
"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
,
inferring
what
his
companion
meant
,
rather
from
his
gestures
than
his
technical
mode
of
expressing
himself
(
to
which
,
as
he
was
ignorant
of
his
calling
,
he
wanted
the
clue
)
,
rejected
this
proposition
for
the
second
time
,
and
gave
the
word
"
Forward
!
"
<EOS>
which
was
echoed
by
a
hundred
voices
from
without
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
the
Warren
!
"
shouted
Dennis
as
he
ran
out
,
followed
by
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
witness
's
house
,
my
lads
!
"
  
<EOS>
A
loud
yell
followed
,
and
the
whole
throng
hurried
off
,
mad
for
pillage
and
destruction
.
 
<EOS>
Hugh
lingered
behind
for
a
few
moments
to
stimulate
himself
with
more
drink
,
and
to
set
all
the
taps
running
,
a
few
of
which
had
accidentally
been
spared
;
then
,
glancing
round
the
despoiled
and
plundered
room
,
through
whose
shattered
window
the
rioters
had
thrust
the
Maypole
itself
,
---
for
even
that
had
been
sawn
down
,
---
<EOS>
lighted
a
torch
,
clapped
the
mute
and
motionless
John
Willet
on
the
back
,
and
waving
his
light
above
his
head
,
and
uttering
a
fierce
shout
,
hastened
after
his
companions
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
55
    
John
Willet
,
left
alone
in
his
dismantled
bar
,
continued
to
sit
staring
about
him
;
awake
as
to
his
eyes
,
certainly
,
but
with
all
his
powers
of
reason
and
reflection
in
a
sound
and
dreamless
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
round
upon
the
room
which
had
been
for
years
,
and
was
within
an
hour
ago
,
the
pride
of
his
heart
;
and
not
a
muscle
of
his
face
was
moved
.
 
<EOS>
The
night
,
without
,
looked
black
and
cold
through
the
dreary
gaps
in
the
casement
;
the
precious
liquids
,
now
nearly
leaked
away
,
dripped
with
a
hollow
sound
upon
the
floor
;
the
Maypole
peered
ruefully
in
through
the
broken
window
,
like
the
bowsprit
of
a
wrecked
ship
;
the
ground
might
have
been
the
bottom
of
the
sea
,
it
was
so
strewn
with
precious
fragments
.
 
<EOS>
Currents
of
air
rushed
in
,
as
the
old
doors
jarred
and
creaked
upon
their
hinges
;
the
candles
flickered
and
guttered
down
,
and
made
long
winding
-
sheets
;
the
cheery
deep
-
red
curtains
flapped
and
fluttered
idly
in
the
wind
;
even
the
stout
Dutch
kegs
,
overthrown
and
lying
empty
in
dark
corners
,
seemed
the
mere
husks
of
good
fellows
whose
jollity
had
departed
,
and
who
could
kindle
with
a
friendly
glow
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
John
saw
this
desolation
,
and
yet
saw
it
not
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
perfectly
contented
to
sit
there
,
staring
at
it
,
and
felt
no
more
indignation
or
discomfort
in
his
bonds
than
if
they
had
been
robes
of
honour
.
 
<EOS>
So
far
as
he
was
personally
concerned
,
old
Time
lay
snoring
,
and
the
world
stood
still
.
  
<EOS>
Save
for
the
dripping
from
the
barrels
,
the
rustling
of
such
light
fragments
of
destruction
as
the
wind
affected
,
and
the
dull
creaking
of
the
open
doors
,
all
was
profoundly
quiet
:
<EOS>
indeed
,
these
sounds
,
like
the
ticking
of
the
death
-
watch
in
the
night
,
only
made
the
silence
they
invaded
deeper
and
more
apparent
.
 
<EOS>
But
quiet
or
noisy
,
it
was
all
one
to
John
.
 
<EOS>
If
a
train
of
heavy
artillery
could
have
come
up
and
commenced
ball
practice
outside
the
window
,
it
would
have
been
all
the
same
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
long
way
beyond
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
A
ghost
could
n't
have
overtaken
him
.
  
<EOS>
By
and
by
he
heard
a
footstep
---
a
hurried
,
and
yet
cautious
footstep
---
coming
on
towards
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
It
stopped
,
advanced
again
,
then
seemed
to
go
quite
round
it
.
 
<EOS>
Having
done
that
,
it
came
beneath
the
window
,
and
a
head
looked
in
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
strongly
relieved
against
the
darkness
outside
by
the
glare
of
the
guttering
candles
.
 
<EOS>
A
pale
,
worn
,
withered
face
;
the
eyes
---
 
but
that
was
owing
to
its
gaunt
condition
---
unnaturally
large
and
bright
;
the
hair
,
a
grizzled
black
.
 
<EOS>
It
gave
a
searching
glance
<EOS>
all
round
the
room
,
and
a
deep
voice
said
:
  
"
Are
you
alone
in
this
house
?
"
  
<EOS>
John
made
no
sign
,
though
the
question
was
repeated
twice
,
and
he
heard
it
distinctly
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
moment
's
pause
,
the
man
got
in
at
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
John
was
not
at
all
surprised
at
this
,
either
.
 
<EOS>
There
had
been
so
much
getting
in
and
out
of
window
in
the
course
of
the
last
hour
or
so
,
that
he
had
quite
forgotten
the
door
,
and
seemed
to
have
lived
among
such
exercises
from
infancy
.
  
<EOS>
The
man
wore
a
large
,
dark
,
faded
cloak
,
and
a
slouched
hat
;
he
walked
up
close
to
John
,
and
looked
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
John
returned
the
compliment
with
interest
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
long
have
you
been
sitting
thus
?
"
said
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
John
considered
,
but
nothing
came
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Which
way
have
the
party
gone
?
"
  
<EOS>
Some
wandering
speculations
relative
to
the
fashion
of
the
stranger
's
boots
,
got
into
Mr
Willet
's
mind
by
some
accident
or
other
,
but
they
got
out
again
in
a
hurry
,
and
left
him
in
his
former
state
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
do
well
to
speak
,
"
said
the
man
;
"
you
may
keep
a
whole
skin
,
though
you
have
nothing
else
left
that
can
be
hurt
.
 
<EOS>
Which
way
have
the
party
gone
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
That
!
"
said
John
,
finding
his
voice
all
at
once
,
and
nodding
with
perfect
good
faith
---
he
could
n't
point
;
he
was
so
tightly
bound
---
in
exactly
the
opposite
direction
to
the
right
one
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
lie
!
"
said
the
man
angrily
,
and
with
a
threatening
gesture
.
<EOS>
"
I
came
that
way
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
betray
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
so
evident
that
John
's
imperturbability
was
not
assumed
,
but
was
the
result
of
the
late
proceedings
under
his
roof
,
that
the
man
stayed
his
hand
in
the
very
act
of
striking
him
,
and
turned
away
.
  
<EOS>
John
looked
after
him
without
so
much
as
a
twitch
in
a
single
nerve
of
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
He
seized
a
glass
,
and
holding
it
under
one
of
the
little
casks
until
a
few
drops
were
collected
,
drank
them
greedily
off
;
then
throwing
it
down
upon
the
floor
impatiently
,
he
took
the
vessel
in
his
hands
and
drained
it
into
his
throat
.
 
<EOS>
Some
scraps
of
bread
and
meat
were
scattered
about
,
and
on
these
he
fell
next
;
eating
them
with
voracity
,
and
pausing
every
now
and
then
to
listen
for
some
fancied
noise
outside
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
refreshed
himself
in
this
manner
with
violent
haste
,
and
raised
another
barrel
to
his
lips
,
he
pulled
his
hat
upon
his
brow
as
though
he
were
about
to
leave
the
house
,
and
turned
to
John
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
are
your
servants
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Willet
indistinctly
remembered
to
have
heard
the
rioters
calling
to
them
to
throw
the
key
of
the
room
in
which
they
were
,
out
of
window
,
for
their
keeping
.
 
<EOS>
He
therefore
replied
,
"
Locked
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
for
them
if
they
remain
quiet
,
and
well
for
you
if
you
do
the
like
,
"
said
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
show
me
the
way
the
party
went
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
time
Mr
Willet
indicated
it
correctly
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
was
hurrying
to
the
door
,
when
suddenly
there
came
towards
them
on
the
wind
,
the
loud
and
rapid
tolling
of
an
alarm
-
bell
,
and
then
a
bright
and
vivid
glare
streamed
up
,
which
illumined
,
not
only
the
whole
chamber
,
but
all
the
country
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
the
sudden
change
from
darkness
to
this
dreadful
light
,
it
was
not
the
sound
of
distant
shrieks
and
shouts
of
triumph
,
it
was
not
this
dread
invasion
of
the
serenity
and
peace
of
night
,
that
drove
the
man
back
as
though
a
thunderbolt
had
struck
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
Bell
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
ghastliest
shape
the
human
mind
has
ever
pictured
in
its
wildest
dreams
had
risen
up
before
him
,
he
could
not
have
staggered
backward
from
its
touch
,
as
he
did
from
the
first
sound
of
that
loud
iron
voice
.
 
<EOS>
With
eyes
that
started
from
his
head
,
his
limbs
convulsed
,
his
face
most
horrible
to
see
,
he
raised
one
arm
high
up
into
the
air
,
and
holding
something
visionary
back
and
down
,
with
his
other
hand
,
drove
at
it
as
though
he
held
a
knife
and
stabbed
it
to
the
heart
.
 
<EOS>
He
clutched
his
hair
,
and
stopped
his
ears
,
and
travelled
madly
round
and
round
;
then
gave
a
frightful
cry
,
and
with
it
rushed
away
:
still
,
still
,
the
Bell
tolled
on
and
seemed
to
follow
him
---
louder
and
louder
,
hotter
and
hotter
yet
.
 
<EOS>
The
glare
grew
brighter
,
the
roar
of
voices
deeper
;
the
crash
of
heavy
bodies
falling
,
shook
the
air
;
bright
streams
of
sparks
rose
up
into
the
sky
;
but
louder
than
them
all
---
 
rising
faster
far
,
to
Heaven
---
a
million
times
more
fierce
and
furious
---
pouring
forth
dreadful
secrets
after
its
long
silence
---
 
speaking
the
language
of
the
dead
---
the
Bell
---
the
Bell
!
  
<EOS>
What
hunt
of
spectres
could
surpass
that
dread
pursuit
and
flight
!
<EOS>
Had
there
been
a
legion
of
them
on
his
track
,
he
could
have
better
borne
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
would
have
had
a
beginning
and
an
end
,
but
here
all
space
was
full
.
 
<EOS>
The
one
pursuing
voice
was
everywhere
:
it
sounded
in
the
earth
,
the
air
;
shook
the
long
grass
,
and
howled
among
the
trembling
trees
.
 
<EOS>
The
echoes
caught
it
up
,
the
owls
hooted
as
it
flew
upon
the
breeze
,
the
nightingale
was
silent
and
hid
herself
among
the
thickest
boughs
:
it
seemed
to
goad
and
urge
the
angry
fire
,
and
lash
it
into
madness
;
everything
was
steeped
in
one
prevailing
red
;
the
glow
was
everywhere
;
nature
was
drenched
in
blood
:
still
the
remorseless
crying
of
that
awful
voice
---
the
Bell
,
the
Bell
!
  
<EOS>
It
ceased
;
but
not
in
his
ears
.
 
<EOS>
The
knell
was
at
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
No
work
of
man
had
ever
voice
like
that
which
sounded
there
,
and
warned
him
that
it
cried
unceasingly
to
Heaven
.
 
<EOS>
Who
could
hear
that
hell
,
and
not
know
what
it
said
!
 
<EOS>
There
was
murder
in
its
every
note
---
cruel
,
relentless
,
savage
murder
---
the
murder
of
a
confiding
man
,
by
one
who
held
his
every
trust
.
 
<EOS>
Its
ringing
summoned
phantoms
from
their
graves
.
 
<EOS>
What
face
was
that
,
in
which
a
friendly
smile
changed
to
a
look
of
half
incredulous
horror
,
which
stiffened
for
a
moment
into
one
of
pain
,
then
changed
again
into
an
imploring
glance
at
Heaven
,
and
so
fell
idly
down
with
upturned
eyes
,
like
the
dead
stags
'
he
had
often
peeped
at
when
a
little
child
:
shrinking
and
shuddering
<EOS>
---
there
was
a
dreadful
thing
to
think
of
now
!
<EOS>
---
and
clinging
to
an
apron
as
he
looked
!
 
<EOS>
He
sank
upon
the
ground
,
and
grovelling
down
as
if
he
would
dig
himself
a
place
to
hide
in
,
covered
his
face
and
ears
:
but
no
,
no
,
no
,
---
a
hundred
walls
and
roofs
of
brass
would
not
shut
out
that
bell
,
for
in
it
spoke
the
wrathful
voice
of
God
,
and
from
that
voice
,
the
whole
wide
universe
could
not
afford
a
refuge
!
  
<EOS>
While
he
rushed
up
and
down
,
not
knowing
where
to
turn
,
and
while
he
lay
crouching
there
,
the
work
went
briskly
on
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
left
the
Maypole
,
the
rioters
formed
into
a
solid
body
,
and
advanced
at
a
quick
pace
towards
the
Warren
.
 
<EOS>
Rumour
of
their
approach
<EOS>
having
gone
before
,
they
found
the
garden
-
doors
fast
closed
,
the
windows
made
secure
,
and
the
house
profoundly
dark
:
not
a
light
being
visible
in
any
portion
of
the
building
.
 
<EOS>
After
some
fruitless
ringing
at
the
bells
,
and
beating
at
the
iron
gates
,
they
drew
off
a
few
paces
to
reconnoitre
,
and
confer
upon
the
course
it
would
be
best
to
take
.
  
<EOS>
Very
little
conference
was
needed
,
when
all
were
bent
upon
one
desperate
purpose
,
infuriated
with
liquor
,
and
flushed
with
successful
riot
.
 
<EOS>
The
word
being
given
to
surround
the
house
,
some
climbed
the
gates
,
or
dropped
into
the
shallow
trench
and
scaled
the
garden
wall
,
while
others
pulled
down
the
solid
iron
fence
,
and
while
they
made
a
breach
to
enter
by
,
made
deadly
weapons
of
the
bars
.
 
<EOS>
The
house
being
completely
encircled
,
a
small
number
of
men
were
despatched
to
break
open
a
tool
-
shed
in
the
garden
;
and
during
their
absence
on
this
errand
,
the
remainder
contented
themselves
with
knocking
violently
at
the
doors
,
and
calling
to
those
within
,
to
come
down
and
open
them
on
peril
of
their
lives
.
  
<EOS>
No
answer
being
returned
to
this
repeated
summons
,
and
the
detachment
who
had
been
sent
away
,
coming
back
with
an
accession
of
pickaxes
,
spades
,
and
hoes
,
they
,
---
together
with
those
who
had
such
arms
already
,
or
carried
(
as
many
did
)
axes
,
poles
,
and
crowbars
,
---
 
struggled
into
the
foremost
rank
,
ready
to
beset
the
doors
and
windows
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
not
at
this
time
more
than
a
dozen
lighted
torches
among
them
;
but
when
these
preparations
were
completed
,
flaming
links
were
distributed
and
passed
from
hand
to
hand
with
such
rapidity
,
that
,
in
a
minute
's
time
,
at
least
two
-
thirds
of
the
whole
roaring
mass
bore
,
each
man
in
his
hand
,
a
blazing
brand
.
<EOS>
Whirling
these
about
their
heads
they
raised
a
loud
shout
,
and
fell
to
work
upon
the
doors
and
windows
.
  
<EOS>
Amidst
the
clattering
of
heavy
blows
,
the
rattling
of
broken
glass
,
the
cries
and
execrations
of
the
mob
,
and
all
the
din
and
turmoil
of
the
scene
,
Hugh
and
his
friends
kept
together
at
the
turret
-
door
where
Mr
Haredale
had
last
admitted
him
and
old
John
Willet
;
and
spent
their
united
force
on
that
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
strong
old
oaken
door
,
guarded
by
good
bolts
and
a
heavy
bar
,
but
it
soon
went
crashing
in
upon
the
narrow
stairs
behind
,
and
made
,
as
it
were
,
a
platform
to
facilitate
their
tearing
up
into
the
rooms
above
.
 
<EOS>
Almost
at
the
same
moment
,
a
dozen
other
points
were
forced
,
and
at
every
one
the
crowd
poured
in
like
water
.
  
<EOS>
A
few
armed
servant
-
men
were
posted
in
the
hall
,
and
when
the
rioters
forced
an
entrance
there
,
they
fired
some
half
-
a
-
dozen
shots
.
 
<EOS>
But
these
taking
no
effect
,
and
the
concourse
coming
on
like
an
army
of
devils
,
they
only
thought
of
consulting
their
own
safety
,
and
retreated
,
echoing
their
assailants
'
cries
,
and
hoping
in
the
confusion
to
be
taken
for
rioters
themselves
;
in
which
stratagem
they
succeeded
,
with
the
exception
of
one
old
man
who
was
never
heard
of
again
,
and
was
said
to
have
had
his
brains
beaten
out
with
an
iron
bar
<EOS>
(
one
of
his
fellows
reported
that
he
had
seen
the
old
man
fall
)
,
and
to
have
been
afterwards
burnt
in
the
flames
.
  
<EOS>
The
besiegers
being
now
in
complete
possession
of
the
house
,
spread
themselves
over
it
from
garret
to
cellar
,
and
plied
their
demon
labours
fiercely
.
 
<EOS>
While
some
small
parties
kindled
bonfires
underneath
the
windows
,
others
broke
up
the
furniture
and
cast
the
fragments
down
to
feed
the
flames
below
;
where
the
apertures
in
the
wall
(
windows
no
longer
)
were
large
enough
,
they
threw
out
tables
,
chests
of
drawers
,
beds
,
mirrors
,
pictures
,
and
flung
them
whole
into
the
fire
;
while
every
fresh
addition
to
the
blazing
masses
was
received
with
shouts
,
and
howls
,
and
yells
,
which
added
new
and
dismal
terrors
to
the
conflagration
.
 
<EOS>
Those
who
had
axes
and
had
spent
their
fury
on
the
movables
,
chopped
and
tore
down
the
doors
and
window
frames
,
broke
up
the
flooring
,
hewed
away
the
rafters
,
and
buried
men
who
lingered
in
the
upper
rooms
,
in
heaps
of
ruins
.
 
<EOS>
Some
searched
the
drawers
,
the
chests
,
the
boxes
,
writing
-
desks
,
and
closets
,
for
jewels
,
plate
,
and
money
;
while
others
,
less
mindful
of
gain
and
more
mad
for
destruction
,
cast
their
whole
contents
into
the
courtyard
without
examination
,
and
called
to
those
below
,
to
heap
them
on
the
blaze
.
 
<EOS>
Men
who
had
been
into
the
cellars
,
and
had
staved
the
casks
,
rushed
to
and
fro
stark
mad
,
setting
fire
to
all
they
saw
---
often
to
the
dresses
of
their
own
friends
---
and
kindling
the
building
in
so
many
parts
that
some
had
no
time
for
escape
,
and
were
seen
,
with
drooping
hands
and
blackened
faces
,
hanging
senseless
on
the
window
-
sills
to
which
they
had
crawled
,
until
they
were
sucked
and
drawn
into
the
burning
gulf
.
 
<EOS>
The
more
the
fire
crackled
and
raged
,
the
wilder
and
more
cruel
the
men
grew
;
as
though
moving
in
that
element
they
became
fiends
,
and
changed
their
earthly
nature
for
the
qualities
that
give
delight
in
hell
.
  
<EOS>
The
burning
pile
,
revealing
rooms
and
passages
red
hot
,
through
gaps
made
in
the
crumbling
walls
<EOS>
;
the
tributary
fires
that
licked
the
outer
bricks
and
stones
,
with
their
long
forked
tongues
,
and
ran
up
to
meet
the
glowing
mass
within
;
the
shining
of
the
flames
upon
the
villains
who
looked
on
and
fed
them
;
the
roaring
of
the
angry
blaze
,
so
bright
and
high
that
it
seemed
in
its
rapacity
to
have
swallowed
up
the
very
smoke
;
the
living
flakes
the
wind
bore
rapidly
away
and
hurried
on
with
,
like
a
storm
of
fiery
snow
;
the
noiseless
breaking
of
great
beams
of
wood
,
which
fell
like
feathers
on
the
heap
of
ashes
,
and
crumbled
in
the
very
act
to
sparks
and
powder
;
the
lurid
tinge
that
overspread
the
sky
,
and
the
darkness
,
very
deep
by
contrast
,
which
prevailed
around
;
the
exposure
to
the
coarse
,
common
gaze
,
of
every
little
nook
which
usages
of
home
had
made
a
sacred
place
,
and
the
destruction
by
rude
hands
of
every
little
household
favourite
which
old
associations
made
a
dear
and
precious
thing
:
all
this
taking
place
---
not
among
pitying
looks
and
friendly
murmurs
of
compassion
,
but
brutal
shouts
and
exultations
,
which
seemed
to
make
the
very
rats
who
stood
by
the
old
house
too
long
,
creatures
with
some
claim
upon
the
pity
and
regard
of
those
its
roof
had
sheltered
:
---
<EOS>
combined
to
form
a
scene
never
to
be
forgotten
by
those
who
saw
it
and
were
not
actors
in
the
work
,
so
long
as
life
endured
.
  
<EOS>
And
who
were
they
?
 
<EOS>
The
alarm
-
bell
rang
---
<EOS>
and
it
was
pulled
by
no
faint
or
hesitating
hands
---
for
a
long
time
;
but
not
a
soul
was
seen
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
the
insurgents
said
that
when
it
ceased
,
they
heard
the
shrieks
of
women
,
and
saw
some
garments
fluttering
in
the
air
,
as
a
party
of
men
bore
away
no
unresisting
burdens
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
could
say
that
this
was
true
or
false
,
in
such
an
uproar
;
but
where
was
Hugh
?
 
<EOS>
Who
among
them
had
seen
him
,
since
the
forcing
of
the
doors
?
<EOS>
The
cry
spread
through
the
body
.
 
<EOS>
Where
was
Hugh
!
  
<EOS>
"
Here
!
"
he
hoarsely
cried
,
appearing
from
the
darkness
;
out
of
breath
,
and
blackened
with
the
smoke
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
done
all
we
can
;
the
fire
is
burning
itself
out
;
and
even
the
corners
where
it
has
n't
spread
,
are
nothing
but
heaps
of
ruins
.
 
<EOS>
Disperse
,
my
lads
,
while
the
coast
's
clear
;
get
back
by
different
ways
;
and
meet
as
usual
!
"
 
<EOS>
With
that
,
he
disappeared
again
,
---
contrary
to
his
wo
nt
,
for
he
was
always
first
to
advance
,
and
last
to
go
away
,
---
leaving
them
to
follow
homewards
as
they
would
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
an
easy
task
to
draw
off
such
a
throng
.
 
<EOS>
If
Bedlam
gates
had
been
flung
wide
open
,
there
would
not
have
issued
forth
such
maniacs
as
the
frenzy
of
that
night
had
made
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
men
there
,
who
danced
and
trampled
on
the
beds
of
flowers
as
though
they
trod
down
human
enemies
,
and
wrenched
them
from
the
stalks
,
like
savages
who
twisted
human
necks
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
men
who
cast
their
lighted
torches
in
the
air
,
and
suffered
them
to
fall
upon
their
heads
and
faces
,
blistering
the
skin
with
deep
unseemly
burns
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
men
who
rushed
up
to
the
fire
,
and
paddled
in
it
with
their
hands
as
if
in
water
;
and
others
who
were
restrained
by
force
from
plunging
in
,
to
gratify
their
deadly
longing
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
skull
of
one
drunken
lad
---
not
twenty
,
by
his
looks
---
who
lay
upon
the
ground
with
a
bottle
to
his
mouth
,
the
lead
from
the
roof
came
streaming
down
in
a
shower
of
liquid
fire
,
white
hot
;
melting
his
head
like
wax
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
scattered
parties
were
collected
,
men
---
 
living
yet
,
but
singed
as
with
hot
irons
---
were
plucked
out
of
the
cellars
,
and
carried
off
upon
the
shoulders
of
others
,
who
strove
to
wake
them
as
they
went
along
,
with
ribald
jokes
,
and
left
them
,
dead
,
in
the
passages
of
hospitals
.
 
<EOS>
But
of
all
the
howling
throng
not
one
learnt
mercy
from
,
or
sickened
at
,
these
sights
;
nor
was
the
fierce
,
besotted
,
senseless
rage
of
one
man
glutted
.
  
<EOS>
Slowly
,
and
in
small
clusters
,
with
hoarse
hurrahs
and
repetitions
of
their
usual
cry
,
the
assembly
dropped
away
.
 
<EOS>
The
last
few
red
-
eyed
stragglers
reeled
after
those
who
had
gone
before
;
the
distant
noise
of
men
calling
to
each
other
,
and
whistling
for
others
whom
they
missed
,
grew
fainter
and
fainter
;
at
length
even
these
sounds
died
away
,
and
silence
reigned
alone
.
  
<EOS>
Silence
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
The
glare
of
the
flames
had
sunk
into
a
fitful
,
flashing
light
;
and
the
gentle
stars
,
invisible
till
now
,
looked
down
upon
the
blackening
heap
.
 
<EOS>
A
dull
smoke
hung
upon
the
ruin
,
as
though
to
hide
it
from
those
eyes
of
Heaven
;
and
the
wind
forbore
to
move
it
.
 
<EOS>
Bare
walls
,
roof
open
to
the
sky
---
chambers
,
where
the
beloved
dead
had
,
many
and
many
a
fair
day
,
risen
to
new
life
and
energy
;
where
so
many
dear
ones
had
been
sad
and
merry
;
which
were
connected
with
so
many
thoughts
and
hopes
,
regrets
and
changes
---
all
gone
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
left
but
a
dull
and
dreary
blank
---
a
smouldering
heap
of
dust
and
ashes
---
<EOS>
the
silence
and
solitude
of
utter
desolation
.

Chapter
56
    
<EOS>
The
Maypole
cronies
,
little
drearning
of
the
change
so
soon
to
come
upon
their
favourite
haunt
,
struck
through
the
Forest
path
upon
their
way
to
London
;
and
avoiding
the
main
road
,
which
was
hot
and
dusty
,
kept
to
the
by
-
paths
and
the
fields
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
drew
nearer
to
their
destination
,
they
began
to
make
inquiries
of
the
people
whom
they
passed
,
concerning
the
riots
,
and
the
truth
or
falsehood
of
the
stories
they
had
heard
.
 
<EOS>
The
answers
went
far
beyond
any
intelligence
that
had
spread
to
quiet
Chigwell
.
 
<EOS>
One
man
told
them
that
that
afternoon
the
Guards
,
conveying
to
Newgate
some
rioters
who
had
been
re
-
examined
,
had
been
set
upon
by
the
mob
and
compelled
to
retreat
;
another
,
that
the
houses
of
two
witnesses
near
Clare
Market
were
about
to
be
pulled
down
when
he
came
away
;
another
,
that
Sir
George
Saville
's
house
in
Leicester
Fields
was
to
be
burned
that
night
,
and
that
it
would
go
hard
with
Sir
George
if
he
fell
into
the
people
's
hands
,
as
it
was
he
who
had
brought
in
the
Catholic
bill
.
 
<EOS>
All
accounts
agreed
that
the
mob
were
out
,
in
stronger
numbers
and
more
numerous
parties
than
had
yet
appeared
;
that
the
streets
were
unsafe
;
that
no
man
's
house
or
life
was
worth
an
hour
's
purchase
;
that
the
public
consternation
was
increasing
every
moment
;
and
that
many
families
had
already
fled
the
city
.
<EOS>
One
fellow
who
wore
the
popular
colour
,
damned
them
for
not
having
cockades
in
their
hats
,
and
bade
them
set
a
good
watch
to
-
morrow
night
upon
their
prison
doors
,
for
the
locks
would
have
a
straining
;
another
asked
if
they
were
fire
-
proof
,
that
they
walked
abroad
without
the
distinguishing
mark
of
all
good
and
true
men
;
---
and
a
third
who
rode
on
horseback
,
and
was
quite
alone
,
ordered
them
to
throw
each
man
a
shilling
,
in
his
hat
,
towards
the
support
of
the
rioters
.
 
<EOS>
Although
they
were
afraid
to
refuse
compliance
with
this
demand
,
and
were
much
alarmed
by
these
reports
,
they
agreed
,
having
come
so
far
,
to
go
forward
,
and
see
the
real
state
of
things
with
their
own
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
So
they
pushed
on
quicker
,
as
men
do
who
are
excited
by
portentous
news
;
and
ruminating
on
what
they
had
heard
,
spoke
little
to
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
now
night
,
and
as
they
came
nearer
to
the
city
they
had
dismal
confirmation
of
this
intelligence
in
three
great
fires
,
all
close
together
,
which
burnt
fiercely
and
were
gloomily
reflected
in
the
sky
.
 
<EOS>
Arriving
in
the
immediate
suburbs
,
they
found
that
almost
every
house
had
chalked
upon
its
door
in
large
characters
"
No
Popery
,
"
that
the
shops
were
shut
,
and
that
alarm
and
anxiety
were
depicted
in
every
face
they
passed
.
  
<EOS>
Noting
these
things
with
a
degree
of
apprehension
which
neither
of
the
three
cared
to
impart
,
in
its
full
extent
,
to
his
companions
,
they
came
to
a
turnpike
-
gate
,
which
was
shut
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
passing
through
the
turnstile
on
the
path
,
when
a
horseman
rode
up
from
London
at
a
hard
gallop
,
and
called
to
the
toll
-
keeper
in
a
voice
of
great
agitation
,
to
open
quickly
in
the
name
of
God
.
  
<EOS>
The
adjuration
was
so
earnest
and
vehement
,
that
the
man
,
with
a
lantern
in
his
hand
,
came
running
out
---
toll
-
keeper
though
he
was
---
 
and
was
about
to
throw
the
gate
open
,
when
happening
to
look
behind
him
,
he
exclaimed
,
"
<EOS>
Good
Heaven
,
what
's
that
!
 
<EOS>
Another
fire
!
"
  
<EOS>
At
this
,
the
three
turned
their
heads
,
and
saw
in
the
distance
---
 
straight
in
the
direction
whence
they
had
come
---
a
broad
sheet
of
flame
,
casting
a
threatening
light
upon
the
clouds
,
which
glimmered
as
though
the
conflagration
were
behind
them
,
and
showed
like
a
wrathful
sunset
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
mind
misgives
me
,
"
said
the
horseman
,
"
or
<EOS>
I
know
from
what
far
building
those
flames
come
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
stand
aghast
,
my
good
fellow
.
<EOS>
Open
the
gate
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
cried
the
man
,
laying
his
hand
upon
his
horse
's
bridle
as
he
let
him
through
:
"
I
know
you
now
,
sir
;
be
advised
by
me
;
do
not
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
them
pass
,
and
know
what
kind
of
men
they
are
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
be
murdered
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
be
it
!
"
<EOS>
said
the
horseman
,
looking
intently
towards
the
fire
,
and
not
at
him
who
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
sir
---
sir
,
"
cried
the
man
,
grasping
at
his
rein
more
tightly
yet
,
"
if
you
do
go
on
,
wear
the
blue
riband
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
sir
,
"
he
added
,
taking
one
from
his
own
hat
,
"
it
's
necessity
,
not
choice
,
that
makes
me
wear
it
;
it
's
love
of
life
and
home
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Wear
it
for
this
one
night
,
sir
;
only
for
this
one
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
!
"
cried
the
three
friends
,
pressing
round
his
horse
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Haredale
---
worthy
sir
---
<EOS>
good
gentleman
---
<EOS>
pray
be
persuaded
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
's
that
?
"
cried
Mr
Haredale
,
stooping
down
to
look
.
 
<EOS>
"
Did
I
hear
Daisy
's
voice
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
did
,
sir
,
"
cried
the
little
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
be
persuaded
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
This
gentleman
says
very
true
.
 
<EOS>
Your
life
may
hang
upon
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
abruptly
,
"
afraid
to
come
with
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
,
sir
?
---
N
<EOS>
-
n-
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Put
that
riband
in
your
hat
.
 
<EOS>
If
we
meet
the
rioters
,
swear
that
I
took
you
prisoner
for
wearing
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
tell
them
so
<EOS>
with
my
own
lips
;
for
as
I
hope
for
mercy
when
I
die
,
I
will
take
no
quarter
from
them
,
nor
shall
they
have
quarter
from
me
,
if
we
come
hand
to
hand
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
Up
here
---
behind
me
---
quick
!
 
<EOS>
Clasp
<EOS>
me
tight
round
the
body
,
and
fear
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
In
an
instant
they
were
riding
away
,
at
full
gallop
,
in
a
dense
cloud
of
dust
,
and
speeding
on
,
like
hunters
in
a
dream
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
well
<EOS>
the
good
horse
knew
the
road
he
traversed
,
for
never
once
---
no
,
never
once
in
all
the
journey
---
did
Mr
Haredale
cast
his
eyes
upon
the
ground
,
or
turn
them
,
for
an
instant
,
from
the
light
towards
which
they
sped
so
madly
.
 
<EOS>
Once
he
said
in
a
low
voice
,
"
It
is
my
house
,
"
but
that
was
the
only
time
he
spoke
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
came
to
dark
and
doubtful
places
,
he
never
forgot
to
put
his
hand
upon
the
little
man
to
hold
him
more
securely
in
his
seat
,
but
he
kept
his
head
erect
and
<EOS>
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
fire
,
then
,
and
always
.
  
<EOS>
The
road
was
dangerous
enough
,
for
they
went
the
nearest
way
---
 
headlong
---
far
from
the
highway
---
by
lonely
lanes
and
paths
,
where
waggon
-
wheels
had
worn
deep
ruts
;
where
hedge
and
ditch
hemmed
in
the
narrow
strip
of
ground
;
and
tall
trees
,
arching
overhead
,
made
it
profoundly
dark
.
 
<EOS>
But
on
,
on
,
on
,
with
neither
stop
nor
stumble
,
till
they
reached
the
Maypole
door
,
and
could
plainly
see
that
the
fire
began
to
fade
,
as
if
for
want
of
fuel
.
  
<EOS>
"
Down
---
for
one
moment
---
for
but
one
moment
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
helping
Daisy
to
the
ground
,
and
following
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
Willet
---
 
Willet
---
where
are
my
niece
and
servants
---
Willet
!
"
  
<EOS>
Crying
to
him
distractedly
,
he
rushed
into
the
bar
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
The
landlord
bound
and
fastened
to
his
chair
;
the
place
dismantled
,
stripped
,
and
pulled
about
his
ears
;
---
nobody
could
have
taken
shelter
here
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
a
strong
man
,
accustomed
to
restrain
himself
,
and
suppress
his
strong
emotions
;
but
this
preparation
for
what
was
to
follow
---
 
though
he
had
seen
that
fire
burning
,
and
knew
that
his
house
must
be
razed
to
the
ground
---
was
more
than
he
could
bear
.
 
<EOS>
He
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
for
a
moment
,
and
turned
away
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Johnny
,
Johnny
,
"
said
Solomon
---
and
the
simple
-
hearted
fellow
cried
outright
,
and
wrung
his
hands
---
"
<EOS>
Oh
dear
old
Johnny
,
here
's
a
change
!
 
<EOS>
That
the
Maypole
bar
should
come
to
this
,
and
we
should
live
to
see
it
!
 
<EOS>
The
old
Warren
too
,
<EOS>
Johnny
---
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
---
<EOS>
oh
,
Johnny
,
what
a
piteous
sight
this
is
!
"
  
<EOS>
Pointing
to
Mr
Haredale
as
he
said
these
words
,
little
Solomon
Daisy
put
his
elbows
on
the
back
of
Mr
Willet
's
chair
,
and
fairly
blubbered
on
his
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
While
Solomon
was
speaking
,
old
John
sat
,
mute
as
a
stock
-
fish
,
staring
at
him
with
an
unearthly
glare
,
and
displaying
,
by
every
possible
symptom
,
entire
and
complete
unconsciousness
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
Solomon
was
silent
again
,
John
followed
,
with
his
great
round
eyes
,
the
direction
of
his
looks
,
and
did
appear
to
have
some
dawning
distant
notion
that
somebody
had
come
to
see
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
us
,
do
n't
you
,
Johnny
?
"
said
the
little
clerk
,
rapping
himself
on
the
breast
.
 
<EOS>
"
Daisy
,
you
know
---
Chigwell
Church
---
<EOS>
bell
-
ringer
---
<EOS>
little
desk
on
Sundays
---
eh
,
Johnny
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Willet
reflected
for
a
few
moments
,
and
then
muttered
,
as
it
were
mechanically
:
"
Let
us
sing
to
the
praise
and
glory
of
---
"
  
"
Yes
,
to
be
sure
,
"
cried
the
little
man
,
hastily
;
<EOS>
"
that
's
it
---
 
<EOS>
that
's
me
,
Johnny
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
all
right
now
,
an't
you
?
 
<EOS>
Say
you
're
all
right
,
Johnny
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
right
?
"
<EOS>
pondered
Mr
Willet
,
as
if
that
were
a
matter
entirely
between
himself
and
his
conscience
.
 
<EOS>
"
All
right
?
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
have
n't
been
misusing
you
with
sticks
,
or
pokers
,
or
any
other
blunt
instruments
---
have
they
,
Johnny
?
"
asked
Solomon
,
with
a
very
anxious
glance
at
Mr
Willet
's
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
did
n't
beat
you
,
did
they
?
"
  
<EOS>
John
knitted
his
brow
;
looked
downwards
,
as
if
he
were
mentally
engaged
in
some
arithmetical
calculation
;
then
upwards
,
as
if
the
total
would
not
come
at
his
call
;
then
at
Solomon
Daisy
,
from
his
eyebrow
to
his
shoe
-
buckle
;
then
very
slowly
round
the
bar
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
a
great
,
round
,
leaden
-
looking
,
and
not
at
all
<EOS>
transparent
tear
,
came
rolling
out
of
each
eye
,
and
<EOS>
he
said
,
as
he
shook
his
head
:
  
<EOS>
"
If
they
'd
only
had
the
goodness
to
murder
me
,
I
'd
have
thanked
'em
kindly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
no
,
do
n't
say
that
,
Johnny
,
"
whimpered
his
little
friend
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
,
very
bad
,
but
not
quite
so
bad
as
that
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Look'ee
here
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
cried
John
,
turning
his
rueful
eyes
on
Mr
Haredale
,
who
had
dropped
on
one
knee
,
and
was
hastily
beginning
to
untie
his
bonds
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look'ee
here
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
The
very
Maypole
---
the
old
dumb
Maypole
---
stares
in
at
the
winder
,
as
if
it
said
,
"
John
Willet
,
John
Willet
,
let
's
go
and
pitch
ourselves
in
the
nighest
pool
of
water
as
is
deep
enough
to
hold
us
;
for
our
day
is
over
!
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
,
Johnny
,
do
n't
,
"
cried
his
friend
:
no
less
affected
with
this
mournful
effort
of
Mr
Willet
's
imagination
,
than
by
the
sepulchral
tone
in
which
he
had
spoken
of
the
Maypole
.
 
<EOS>
"
Please
do
n't
,
Johnny
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
loss
is
great
,
and
your
misfortune
a
heavy
one
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
looking
restlessly
towards
the
door
:
"
and
this
is
not
a
time
to
comfort
you
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
were
,
I
am
in
no
condition
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
Before
I
leave
you
,
tell
me
one
thing
,
and
try
to
tell
me
plainly
,
I
implore
you
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
seen
,
or
heard
of
Emma
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
said
Mr
Willet
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
any
one
but
these
bloodhounds
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
rode
away
,
I
trust
in
Heaven
,
before
these
dreadful
scenes
began
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
who
,
between
his
agitation
,
his
eagerness
to
mount
his
horse
again
,
and
the
dexterity
with
which
the
cords
were
tied
,
had
scarcely
yet
undone
one
knot
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
knife
,
Daisy
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
did
n't
,
"
said
John
,
looking
about
,
as
though
he
had
lost
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
or
some
such
slight
article
---
"
<EOS>
either
of
you
gentlemen
---
see
a
---
a
coffin
anywheres
,
did
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Willet
!
"
cried
Mr
Haredale
.
 
<EOS>
Solomon
dropped
the
knife
,
and
instantly
becoming
limp
from
head
to
foot
,
exclaimed
"
Good
gracious
!
"
  
"
<EOS>
---
Because
,
"
said
John
,
not
at
all
regarding
them
,
"
a
dead
man
called
a
little
time
ago
,
on
his
way
yonder
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
told
you
what
name
was
on
the
plate
,
if
he
had
brought
his
coffin
with
him
,
and
left
it
behind
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
did
n't
,
it
do
n't
signify
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
landlord
,
who
had
listened
to
these
words
with
breathless
attention
,
started
that
moment
to
his
feet
;
and
,
without
a
word
,
drew
Solomon
Daisy
to
the
door
,
mounted
his
horse
,
took
him
up
behind
again
,
and
flew
rather
than
galloped
towards
the
pile
of
ruins
,
which
that
day
's
sun
had
shone
upon
,
a
stately
house
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Willet
stared
after
them
,
listened
,
looked
down
upon
himself
to
make
quite
sure
that
he
was
still
unbound
,
and
,
without
any
manifestation
of
impatience
,
disappointment
,
or
surprise
,
gently
relapsed
into
the
condition
from
which
he
had
so
imperfectly
recovered
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
tied
his
horse
to
the
trunk
of
a
tree
,
and
grasping
his
companion
's
arm
,
stole
softly
along
the
footpath
,
and
into
what
had
been
the
garden
of
his
house
.
 
<EOS>
He
stopped
for
an
instant
to
look
upon
its
smoking
walls
,
and
at
the
stars
that
shone
through
roof
and
floor
upon
the
heap
of
crumbling
ashes
.
 
<EOS>
Solomon
glanced
timidly
in
his
face
,
but
his
lips
were
tightly
pressed
together
,
a
resolute
and
stern
expression
sat
upon
his
brow
,
and
not
a
tear
,
a
look
,
or
gesture
indicating
grief
,
escaped
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
drew
his
sword
;
felt
for
a
moment
in
his
breast
,
as
though
he
carried
other
arms
about
him
;
then
grasping
Solomon
by
the
wrist
again
,
went
with
a
cautious
step
all
round
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
into
every
doorway
and
gap
in
the
wall
;
retraced
his
steps
at
every
rustling
of
the
air
among
the
leaves
;
and
searched
in
every
shadowed
nook
with
outstretched
hands
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
they
made
the
circuit
of
the
building
:
but
they
returned
to
the
spot
from
which
they
had
set
out
,
without
encountering
any
human
being
,
or
finding
the
least
trace
of
any
concealed
straggler
.
  
<EOS>
After
a
short
pause
,
Mr
Haredale
shouted
twice
or
thrice
.
 
<EOS>
Then
cried
aloud
,
"
Is
there
any
one
in
hiding
here
,
who
knows
my
voice
!
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
to
fear
now
.
 
<EOS>
If
any
of
my
people
are
near
,
I
entreat
them
to
answer
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
called
them
all
by
name
;
his
voice
was
echoed
in
many
mournful
tones
;
then
all
was
silent
as
before
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
standing
near
the
foot
of
the
turret
,
where
the
alarm
-
bell
hung
.
 
<EOS>
The
fire
had
raged
there
,
and
the
floors
had
been
sawn
,
and
hewn
,
and
beaten
down
,
besides
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
open
to
the
night
;
but
a
part
of
the
staircase
still
remained
,
winding
upward
from
a
great
mound
of
dust
and
cinders
.
 
<EOS>
Fragments
of
the
jagged
and
broken
steps
offered
an
insecure
and
giddy
footing
here
and
there
,
and
then
were
lost
again
,
behind
protruding
angles
of
the
wall
,
or
in
the
deep
shadows
cast
upon
it
by
other
portions
of
the
ruin
;
for
by
this
time
the
moon
had
risen
,
and
shone
brightly
.
  
<EOS>
As
they
stood
here
,
listening
to
the
echoes
as
they
died
away
,
and
hoping
in
vain
to
hear
a
voice
they
knew
,
some
of
the
ashes
in
this
turret
slipped
and
rolled
down
.
 
<EOS>
Startled
by
the
least
noise
in
that
melancholy
place
,
Solomon
looked
up
in
his
companion
's
face
,
and
saw
that
he
had
turned
towards
the
spot
,
and
that
he
watched
and
listened
keenly
.
  
<EOS>
He
covered
the
little
man
's
mouth
with
his
hand
,
and
looked
again
.
<EOS>
Instantly
,
with
kindling
eyes
,
he
bade
him
on
his
life
keep
still
,
and
neither
speak
nor
move
.
 
<EOS>
Then
holding
his
breath
,
and
stooping
down
,
he
stole
into
the
turret
,
with
his
drawn
sword
in
his
hand
,
and
disappeared
.
  
<EOS>
Terrified
to
be
left
there
by
himself
,
under
such
desolate
circumstances
,
and
after
all
he
had
seen
and
heard
that
night
,
Solomon
would
have
followed
,
but
there
had
been
something
in
Mr
Haredale
's
manner
and
his
look
,
the
recollection
of
which
held
him
spellbound
.
 
<EOS>
He
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
;
and
scarcely
venturing
to
breathe
,
looked
up
with
mingled
fear
and
wonder
.
  
<EOS>
Again
the
ashes
slipped
and
rolled
---
very
,
very
softly
---
again
---
and
then
again
,
as
though
they
crumbled
underneath
the
tread
of
a
stealthy
foot
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
a
figure
was
dimly
visible
;
climbing
very
softly
;
and
often
stopping
to
look
down
;
now
it
pursued
its
difficult
way
;
and
now
it
was
hidden
from
the
view
again
.
  
<EOS>
It
emerged
once
more
,
into
the
shadowy
and
uncertain
light
---
higher
now
,
but
not
much
,
for
the
way
was
steep
and
toilsome
,
and
its
progress
very
slow
.
 
<EOS>
What
phantom
of
the
brain
did
he
pursue
;
and
why
did
he
look
down
so
constantly
?
 
<EOS>
He
knew
he
was
alone
.
 
<EOS>
Surely
his
mind
was
not
affected
by
that
night
's
loss
and
agony
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
about
to
throw
himself
headlong
from
the
summit
of
the
tottering
wall
.
 
<EOS>
Solomon
turned
sick
,
and
clasped
his
hands
.
 
<EOS>
His
limbs
trembled
beneath
him
,
and
a
cold
sweat
broke
out
upon
his
pallid
face
.
  
<EOS>
If
he
complied
with
Mr
Haredale
's
last
injunction
now
,
it
was
because
he
had
not
the
power
to
speak
or
move
.
 
<EOS>
He
strained
his
gaze
,
and
fixed
it
on
a
patch
of
moonlight
,
into
which
,
if
he
continued
to
ascend
,
he
must
soon
emerge
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
appeared
there
,
he
would
try
to
call
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
Again
the
ashes
slipped
and
crumbled
;
some
stones
rolled
down
,
and
fell
with
a
dull
,
heavy
sound
upon
the
ground
below
.
 
<EOS>
He
kept
his
eyes
upon
the
piece
of
moonlight
.
 
<EOS>
The
figure
was
coming
on
,
for
its
shadow
was
already
thrown
upon
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
Now
it
appeared
---
and
now
looked
round
at
him
---
and
now
---
   
<EOS>
The
horror
-
stricken
clerk
uttered
a
scream
that
pierced
the
air
,
and
cried
,
"
The
ghost
!
 
<EOS>
The
ghost
!
"
  
<EOS>
Long
before
the
echo
of
his
cry
had
died
away
,
another
form
rushed
out
into
the
light
,
flung
itself
upon
the
foremost
one
,
knelt
down
upon
its
breast
,
and
clutched
its
throat
with
both
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
Villain
!
"
cried
Mr
Haredale
,
in
a
terrible
voice
---
for
it
<EOS>
was
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dead
and
buried
,
as
all
men
supposed
through
your
infernal
arts
,
but
reserved
by
Heaven
for
this
---
at
last
---
at
last
I
have
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
,
whose
hands
are
red
with
my
brother
's
blood
,
and
that
of
his
faithful
servant
,
shed
to
conceal
your
own
atrocious
guilt
---
You
,
Rudge
,
double
murderer
and
monster
,
I
arrest
you
in
the
name
of
God
,
who
has
delivered
you
into
my
hands
.
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
Though
you
had
the
strength
of
twenty
men
,
"
he
added
,
as
the
murderer
writhed
and
struggled
,
you
could
not
escape
me
or
loosen
my
grasp
to
-
night
!
"
    
Chapter
57
    
Barnaby
,
armed
as
we
have
seen
,
continued
to
pace
up
and
down
before
the
stable
-
door
;
glad
to
be
alone
again
,
and
heartily
rejoicing
in
the
unaccustomed
silence
and
tranquillity
.
 
<EOS>
After
the
whirl
of
noise
and
riot
in
which
the
last
two
days
had
been
passed
,
the
pleasures
of
solitude
and
peace
were
enhanced
a
thousandfold
.
<EOS>
He
felt
quite
happy
;
and
as
he
leaned
upon
his
staff
and
mused
,
a
bright
smile
overspread
his
face
,
and
none
but
cheerful
visions
floated
into
his
brain
.
  
<EOS>
Had
he
no
thoughts
of
her
,
whose
sole
delight
he
was
,
and
whom
he
had
unconsciously
plunged
in
such
bitter
sorrow
and
such
deep
affliction
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
at
the
heart
of
all
his
cheerful
hopes
and
proud
reflections
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
she
whom
all
this
honour
and
distinction
were
to
gladden
;
the
joy
and
profit
were
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
What
delight
it
gave
her
to
hear
of
the
bravery
of
her
poor
boy
!
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
He
would
have
known
that
,
without
Hugh
's
telling
him
.
 
<EOS>
And
what
a
precious
thing
it
was
to
know
she
lived
so
happily
,
and
heard
with
so
much
pride
(
he
pictured
to
himself
<EOS>
her
look
when
they
told
her
)
that
he
was
in
such
high
esteem
:
<EOS>
bold
among
the
boldest
,
and
trusted
before
them
all
!
 
<EOS>
And
when
these
frays
were
over
,
and
the
good
lord
had
conquered
his
enemies
,
and
they
were
all
at
peace
again
,
and
he
and
she
were
rich
,
what
happiness
they
would
have
in
talking
of
these
troubled
times
when
he
was
a
great
soldier
:
and
when
they
sat
alone
together
in
the
tranquil
twilight
,
and
she
had
no
longer
reason
to
be
anxious
for
the
morrow
,
what
pleasure
would
he
have
in
the
reflection
that
this
was
his
doing
---
<EOS>
his
---
poor
foolish
Barnaby
's
;
and
in
patting
her
on
the
cheek
,
and
saying
with
a
merry
laugh
,
"
Am
I
silly
now
,
mother
<EOS>
---
am
I
silly
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
With
a
lighter
heart
and
step
,
and
eyes
the
brighter
for
the
happy
tear
that
dimmed
them
for
a
moment
,
Barnaby
resumed
his
walk
;
and
singing
gaily
to
himself
,
kept
guard
upon
his
quiet
post
.
  
<EOS>
His
comrade
Grip
,
the
partner
of
his
watch
,
though
fond
of
basking
in
the
sunshine
,
preferred
to
-
day
to
walk
about
the
stable
;
having
a
great
deal
to
do
in
the
way
of
scattering
the
straw
,
hiding
under
it
such
small
articles
as
had
been
casually
left
about
,
and
haunting
Hugh
's
bed
,
to
which
he
seemed
to
have
taken
a
particular
attachment
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
Barnaby
looked
in
and
called
him
,
and
then
he
came
hopping
out
;
but
he
merely
did
this
as
a
concession
to
his
master
's
weakness
,
and
soon
returned
again
to
his
own
grave
pursuits
:
peering
into
the
straw
with
his
bill
,
and
rapidly
covering
up
the
place
,
as
if
,
Midas
-
like
,
he
were
whispering
secrets
to
the
earth
and
burying
them
;
constantly
busying
himself
upon
the
sly
;
and
affecting
,
whenever
Barnaby
came
past
,
to
look
up
in
the
clouds
and
have
nothing
whatever
on
his
mind
:
in
short
,
conducting
himself
,
in
many
respects
,
in
a
more
than
usually
thoughtful
,
deep
,
and
mysterious
manner
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
day
crept
on
,
Barnaby
,
who
had
no
directions
forbidding
him
to
eat
and
drink
upon
his
post
,
but
had
been
,
on
the
contrary
,
supplied
with
a
bottle
of
beer
and
a
basket
of
provisions
,
determined
to
break
his
fast
,
which
he
had
not
done
since
morning
.
<EOS>
To
this
end
,
he
sat
down
on
the
ground
before
the
door
,
and
putting
his
staff
across
his
knees
in
case
of
alarm
or
surprise
,
summoned
Grip
to
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
This
call
,
the
bird
obeyed
with
great
alacrity
;
crying
,
as
he
sidled
up
to
his
master
,
"
I
'm
a
devil
,
<EOS>
I
'm
a
Polly
,
I
'm
a
kettle
,
I
'm
a
Protestant
,
No
Popery
!
"
 
<EOS>
Having
learnt
this
latter
sentiment
from
the
gentry
among
whom
he
had
lived
of
late
,
he
delivered
it
with
uncommon
emphasis
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
said
,
Grip
!
"
<EOS>
cried
his
master
,
as
he
fed
him
with
the
daintiest
bits
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
said
,
old
boy
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
say
die
,
bow
<EOS>
wow
<EOS>
wow
,
keep
up
your
spirits
,
Grip
Grip
Grip
,
Holloa
!
 
<EOS>
We
'll
all
have
tea
,
I
'm
a
Protestant
kettle
,
No
Popery
!
"
cried
the
raven
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gordon
for
ever
,
Grip
!
"
cried
Barnaby
.
  
<EOS>
The
raven
,
placing
his
head
upon
the
ground
,
looked
at
his
master
sideways
,
as
though
he
would
have
said
,
"
Say
that
again
!
"
<EOS>
Perfectly
understanding
his
desire
,
Barnaby
repeated
the
phrase
a
great
many
times
.
 
<EOS>
The
bird
listened
with
profound
attention
;
sometimes
repeating
the
popular
cry
in
a
low
voice
,
as
if
to
compare
the
two
,
and
try
if
it
would
at
all
help
him
to
this
new
accomplishment
;
sometimes
flapping
his
wings
,
or
barking
;
and
sometimes
in
a
kind
of
desperation
drawing
a
multitude
of
corks
,
with
extraordinary
viciousness
.
  
<EOS>
Barnaby
was
so
intent
upon
his
favourite
,
that
he
was
not
at
first
aware
of
the
approach
of
two
persons
on
horseback
,
who
were
riding
at
a
foot
-
pace
,
and
coming
straight
towards
his
post
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
perceived
them
,
however
,
which
he
did
when
they
were
within
some
fifty
yards
of
him
,
he
jumped
hastily
up
,
and
ordering
Grip
within
doors
,
stood
with
both
hands
on
his
staff
,
waiting
until
he
should
know
whether
they
were
friends
or
foes
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
hardly
done
so
,
when
he
observed
that
those
who
advanced
were
a
gentleman
and
his
servant
;
almost
at
the
same
moment
he
recognised
Lord
George
Gordon
,
before
whom
he
stood
uncovered
,
with
his
eyes
turned
towards
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
day
!
"
said
Lord
George
,
not
reining
in
his
horse
until
he
was
close
beside
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
quiet
,
sir
,
all
safe
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Barnaby
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
rest
are
away
---
 
<EOS>
they
went
by
that
path
---
that
one
.
 
<EOS>
A
grand
party
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
?
"
said
Lord
George
,
looking
thoughtfully
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
They
left
me
here
to
watch
---
to
mount
guard
---
to
keep
everything
secure
till
they
come
back
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
do
it
,
sir
,
for
your
sake
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
a
good
gentleman
;
a
kind
gentleman
---
ay
,
you
are
.
<EOS>
There
are
many
against
you
,
but
we
'll
be
a
match
for
them
,
never
fear
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
?
"
said
Lord
George
---
pointing
to
the
raven
who
was
peeping
out
of
the
stable
-
door
---
but
still
looking
thoughtfully
,
and
in
some
perplexity
<EOS>
,
it
seemed
,
at
Barnaby
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
do
n't
you
know
!
"
retorted
Barnaby
,
with
a
wondering
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
Not
know
what
HE
is
!
 
<EOS>
A
bird
,
to
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
My
bird
---
my
friend
---
 
Grip
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
devil
,
a
kettle
,
a
Grip
,
a
Polly
,
a
Protestant
,
no
Popery
!
"
cried
the
raven
.
  
<EOS>
"
Though
,
indeed
,
"
added
Barnaby
,
laying
his
hand
upon
the
neck
of
Lord
George
's
horse
,
and
speaking
softly
:
"
you
had
good
reason
to
ask
me
what
he
is
,
for
sometimes
it
puzzles
me
---
and
I
am
used
to
him
---
to
think
he
's
only
a
bird
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
my
brother
<EOS>
,
Grip
is
---
always
with
me
---
always
talking
---
always
merry
---
eh
,
Grip
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
raven
answered
by
an
affectionate
croak
,
and
hopping
on
his
master
's
arm
,
which
he
held
downward
for
that
purpose
,
submitted
with
an
air
of
perfect
indifference
to
be
fondled
,
and
turned
his
restless
,
curious
eye
,
now
upon
Lord
George
,
and
now
upon
his
man
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
George
,
biting
his
nails
in
a
discomfited
manner
,
regarded
Barnaby
for
some
time
in
silence
;
then
beckoning
to
his
servant
,
said
:
  
"
<EOS>
Come
hither
,
John
.
"
  
<EOS>
John
Grueby
touched
his
hat
,
and
came
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
ever
seen
this
young
man
before
?
"
<EOS>
his
master
asked
in
a
low
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Twice
,
my
lord
,
"
said
John
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
saw
him
in
the
crowd
last
night
and
Saturday
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Did
---
did
it
seem
to
you
that
his
manner
was
at
all
wild
or
strange
?
"
<EOS>
Lord
George
demanded
,
faltering
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mad
,
"
said
John
,
with
emphatic
brevity
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
do
you
think
him
mad
,
sir
?
"
said
his
master
,
speaking
in
a
peevish
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
use
that
word
too
freely
.
 
<EOS>
Why
do
you
think
him
mad
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
"
John
Grueby
answered
,
"
look
at
his
dress
,
look
at
his
eyes
,
look
at
his
restless
way
,
hear
him
cry
"
No
Popery
!
"
 
<EOS>
Mad
,
my
lord
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
So
because
one
man
dresses
unlike
another
,
"
returned
his
angry
master
,
glancing
at
himself
;
"
and
happens
to
differ
from
other
men
in
his
carriage
and
manner
,
and
to
advocate
a
great
cause
which
the
corrupt
and
irreligious
desert
,
he
is
to
be
accounted
mad
,
is
he
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Stark
,
staring
,
raving
,
roaring
mad
,
my
lord

"
returned
the
unmoved
John
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
say
this
to
my
face
?
"
<EOS>
cried
his
master
,
turning
sharply
upon
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
any
man
,
my
lord
,
who
asks
me
,
"
answered
John
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Gashford
,
I
find
,
was
right
,
"
said
Lord
George
;
"
I
thought
him
prejudiced
,
though
I
ought
to
have
known
a
man
like
him
better
than
to
have
supposed
it
possible
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
have
Mr
Gashford
's
good
word
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
John
,
touching
his
hat
respectfully
,
"
and
I
do
n't
covet
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
an
ill
-
conditioned
,
most
ungrateful
fellow
,
"
said
Lord
George
:
"
a
spy
,
for
anything
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Gashford
is
perfectly
correct
,
as
I
might
have
felt
convinced
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
done
wrong
to
retain
you
in
my
service
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
tacit
insult
to
him
as
my
choice
and
confidential
friend
to
do
so
,
remembering
the
cause
you
sided
with
,
on
the
day
he
was
maligned
at
Westminster
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
leave
me
to
-
night
---
nay
,
as
soon
as
we
reach
home
.
 
<EOS>
The
sooner
the
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
it
comes
to
that
,
I
say
so
too
,
my
lord
.
 
<EOS>
Let
Mr
Gashford
have
his
will
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
my
being
a
spy
,
my
lord
,
you
know
me
better
than
to
believe
it
,
I
am
sure
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
much
about
causes
.
 
<EOS>
My
cause
is
the
cause
of
one
man
against
two
hundred
;
and
I
hope
it
always
will
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
said
quite
enough
,
"
returned
Lord
George
,
motioning
him
to
go
back
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
desire
to
hear
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
'll
let
me
have
another
word
,
my
lord
,
"
returned
John
Grueby
,
"
I
'd
give
this
silly
fellow
a
caution
not
to
stay
here
by
himself
.
 
<EOS>
The
proclamation
is
in
a
good
many
hands
already
,
and
it
's
well
known
that
he
was
concerned
in
the
business
it
relates
to
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
better
get
to
a
place
of
safety
if
he
can
,
poor
creature
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
hear
what
this
man
says
?
"
cried
Lord
George
,
addressing
Barnaby
,
who
had
looked
on
and
wondered
while
this
dialogue
passed
.
"
<EOS>
He
thinks
you
may
be
afraid
to
remain
upon
your
post
,
and
are
kept
here
perhaps
against
your
will
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
think
,
young
man
,
"
said
John
,
in
explanation
,
"
that
the
soldiers
may
turn
out
and
take
you
;
and
that
if
they
do
,
you
will
certainly
be
hung
by
the
neck
till
you
're
dead
---
dead
---
dead
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
think
you
had
better
go
from
here
,
as
fast
as
you
can
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
what
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
coward
,
Grip
,
a
coward
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Barnaby
,
putting
the
raven
on
the
ground
,
and
shouldering
his
staff
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
them
come
!
 
<EOS>
Gordon
for
ever
!
 
<EOS>
Let
them
come
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
"
said
Lord
George
,
"
let
them
!
 
<EOS>
Let
us
see
who
will
venture
to
attack
a
power
like
ours
;
the
solemn
league
of
a
whole
people
.
<EOS>
THIS
a
madman
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
said
well
,
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
proud
to
be
the
leader
of
such
men
as
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bamaby
's
heart
swelled
within
his
bosom
as
he
heard
these
words
.
<EOS>
He
took
Lord
George
's
hand
and
carried
it
to
his
lips
;
patted
his
horse
's
crest
,
as
if
the
affection
and
admiration
he
had
conceived
for
the
man
extended
to
the
animal
he
rode
;
then
unfurling
his
flag
,
and
proudly
waving
it
,
resumed
his
pacing
up
and
down
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
George
,
with
a
kindling
eye
and
glowing
cheek
,
took
off
his
hat
,
and
flourishing
it
above
his
head
,
bade
him
exultingly
Farewell
!
---
then
cantered
off
at
a
brisk
pace
;
after
glancing
angrily
round
to
see
that
his
servant
followed
.
 
<EOS>
Honest
John
set
spurs
to
his
horse
and
rode
after
his
master
,
but
not
before
he
had
again
warned
Barnaby
to
retreat
,
with
many
significant
gestures
,
which
indeed
he
continued
to
make
,
and
Barnaby
to
resist
,
until
the
windings
of
the
road
concealed
them
from
each
other
's
view
.
  
<EOS>
Left
to
himself
again
with
a
still
higher
sense
of
the
importance
of
his
post
,
and
stimulated
to
enthusiasm
by
the
special
notice
and
encouragement
of
his
leader
,
Barnaby
walked
to
and
fro
in
a
delicious
trance
rather
than
as
a
waking
man
.
 
<EOS>
The
sunshine
which
prevailed
around
was
in
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
<EOS>
but
one
desire
ungratified
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
could
only
see
him
now
!
  
<EOS>
The
day
wore
on
;
its
heat
was
gently
giving
place
to
the
cool
of
evening
;
a
light
wind
sprung
up
,
fanning
his
long
hair
,
and
making
the
banner
rustle
pleasantly
above
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
freedom
and
freshness
in
the
sound
and
in
the
time
,
which
chimed
exactly
with
his
mood
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
happier
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
leaning
on
his
staff
looking
towards
the
declining
sun
,
and
reflecting
with
a
smile
that
he
stood
sentinel
at
that
moment
over
buried
gold
,
when
two
or
three
figures
appeared
in
the
distance
,
making
towards
the
house
at
a
rapid
pace
,
and
motioning
with
their
hands
as
though
they
urged
its
inmates
to
retreat
from
some
approaching
danger
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
drew
nearer
,
they
became
more
earnest
in
their
gestures
;
and
they
were
no
sooner
within
hearing
,
than
the
foremost
among
them
cried
that
the
soldiers
were
coming
up
.
  
<EOS>
At
these
words
,
Barnaby
furled
his
flag
,
and
tied
it
round
the
pole
.
 
<EOS>
His
heart
beat
high
while
he
did
so
,
but
he
had
no
more
fear
or
thought
of
retreating
than
the
pole
itself
.
 
<EOS>
The
friendly
stragglers
hurried
past
him
,
after
giving
him
notice
of
his
danger
,
and
quickly
passed
into
the
house
,
where
the
utmost
confusion
immediately
prevailed
.
 
<EOS>
As
those
within
hastily
closed
the
windows
and
the
doors
,
they
urged
him
by
looks
and
signs
to
fly
without
loss
of
time
,
and
called
to
him
many
times
to
do
so
;
but
he
only
shook
his
head
indignantly
in
answer
,
and
stood
the
firmer
on
his
post
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
that
he
was
not
to
be
persuaded
,
they
took
care
of
themselves
;
and
leaving
the
place
with
only
one
old
woman
in
it
,
speedily
withdrew
.
  
<EOS>
As
yet
there
had
been
no
symptom
of
the
news
having
any
better
foundation
than
in
the
fears
of
those
who
brought
it
,
but
The
Boot
had
not
been
deserted
five
minutes
,
when
there
appeared
,
coming
across
the
fields
,
a
body
of
men
who
,
it
was
easy
to
see
,
by
the
glitter
of
their
arms
and
ornaments
in
the
sun
,
and
by
their
orderly
and
regular
mode
of
advancing
---
for
they
came
on
as
one
man
---
were
soldiers
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
very
little
time
,
Barnaby
knew
that
they
were
a
strong
detachment
of
the
Foot
Guards
,
having
along
with
them
two
gentlemen
in
private
clothes
,
and
a
small
party
of
Horse
;
the
latter
brought
up
the
rear
,
and
were
not
in
number
more
than
six
or
eight
.
  
<EOS>
They
advanced
steadily
;
neither
quickening
their
pace
as
they
came
nearer
,
nor
raising
any
cry
,
nor
showing
the
least
emotion
or
anxiety
.
 
<EOS>
Though
this
was
a
matter
of
course
in
the
case
of
regular
troops
,
even
to
Barnaby
,
there
was
something
particularly
impressive
and
disconcerting
in
it
to
one
accustomed
to
the
noise
and
tumult
of
an
undisciplined
mob
.
 
<EOS>
For
all
that
,
he
stood
his
ground
not
a
whit
the
less
resolutely
,
and
looked
on
undismayed
.
  
<EOS>
Presently
,
they
marched
into
the
yard
,
and
halted
.
 
<EOS>
The
commanding
-
officer
despatched
a
messenger
to
the
horsemen
,
one
of
whom
came
riding
back
.
 
<EOS>
Some
words
passed
between
them
,
and
they
glanced
at
Barnaby
;
who
well
remembered
the
man
he
had
unhorsed
at
Westminster
,
and
saw
him
now
before
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
being
speedily
dismissed
,
saluted
,
and
rode
back
to
his
comrades
,
who
were
drawn
up
apart
at
a
short
distance
.
  
<EOS>
The
officer
then
gave
the
word
to
prime
and
load
.
 
<EOS>
The
heavy
ringing
of
the
musket
-
stocks
upon
the
ground
,
and
the
sharp
and
rapid
rattling
of
the
ramrods
in
their
barrels
,
were
a
kind
of
relief
to
Batnahy
,
deadly
though
he
knew
the
purport
of
such
sounds
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
When
this
was
done
,
other
commands
were
given
,
and
the
soldiers
instantaneously
formed
in
single
file
all
round
the
house
and
stables
;
completely
encircling
them
in
every
part
,
at
a
distance
,
perhaps
,
of
some
half
-
dozen
yards
;
at
least
that
seemed
in
Barnaby
's
eyes
to
be
about
the
space
left
between
himself
and
those
who
confronted
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
horsemen
remained
drawn
up
by
themselves
as
before
.
  
<EOS>
The
two
gentlemen
in
private
clothes
who
had
kept
aloof
,
now
rode
forward
,
one
on
either
side
the
officer
.
 
<EOS>
The
proclamation
having
been
produced
and
read
by
one
of
them
,
the
officer
called
on
Barnaby
to
surrender
.
  
<EOS>
He
made
no
answer
,
but
stepping
within
the
door
,
before
which
he
had
kept
guard
,
held
his
pole
crosswise
to
protect
it
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
a
profound
silence
,
he
was
again
called
upon
to
yield
.
  
<EOS>
Still
he
offered
no
reply
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
he
had
enough
to
do
,
to
run
his
eye
backward
and
forward
along
the
half
-
dozen
men
who
immediately
fronted
him
,
and
settle
hurriedly
within
himself
at
which
of
them
he
would
strike
first
,
when
they
pressed
on
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
caught
the
eye
of
one
in
the
centre
,
and
resolved
to
hew
that
fellow
down
,
though
he
died
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
Again
there
was
a
dead
silence
,
and
again
the
same
voice
called
upon
him
to
deliver
himself
up
.
  
<EOS>
Next
moment
he
was
back
in
the
stable
,
dealing
blows
about
him
like
a
madman
.
 
<EOS>
Two
of
the
men
lay
stretched
at
his
feet
<EOS>
:
the
one
he
had
marked
,
dropped
first
---
he
had
a
thought
for
that
,
even
in
the
hot
blood
and
hurry
of
the
struggle
.
 
<EOS>
Another
blow
---
another
!
 
<EOS>
Down
<EOS>
,
mastered
,
wounded
in
the
breast
by
a
heavy
blow
from
the
butt
-
end
of
a
gun
(
he
saw
the
weapon
in
the
act
of
falling
)
---
<EOS>
breathless
---
and
a
prisoner
.
  
<EOS>
An
exclamation
of
surprise
from
the
officer
recalled
him
,
in
some
degree
,
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
round
.
 
<EOS>
Grip
,
after
working
in
secret
all
the
afternoon
,
and
with
redoubled
vigour
while
everybody
's
attention
was
distracted
,
had
plucked
away
the
straw
from
Hugh
's
bed
,
and
turned
up
the
loose
ground
with
his
iron
bill
.
<EOS>
The
hole
had
been
recklessly
filled
to
the
brim
,
and
was
merely
sprinkled
with
earth
.
 
<EOS>
Golden
cups
,
spoons
,
candlesticks
,
coined
guineas
---
all
the
riches
were
revealed
.
  
<EOS>
They
brought
spades
and
a
sack
;
dug
up
everything
that
was
hidden
there
;
and
carried
away
more
than
two
men
could
lift
.
 
<EOS>
They
handcuffed
him
and
bound
his
arms
,
searched
him
,
and
took
away
all
he
had
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
questioned
or
reproached
him
,
or
seemed
to
have
much
curiosity
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
men
he
had
stunned
,
were
carried
off
by
their
companions
in
the
same
business
-
like
way
in
which
everything
else
was
done
.
 
<EOS>
Finally
,
he
was
left
under
a
guard
of
four
soldiers
with
fixed
bayonets
,
while
the
officer
directed
in
person
the
search
of
the
house
and
the
other
buildings
connected
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
soon
completed
.
 
<EOS>
The
soldiers
formed
again
in
the
yard
;
he
was
marched
out
,
with
his
guard
about
him
;
and
ordered
to
fall
in
,
where
a
space
was
left
.
 
<EOS>
The
others
closed
up
all
round
,
and
so
they
moved
away
,
with
the
prisoner
in
the
centre
.
  
<EOS>
When
they
came
into
the
streets
,
he
felt
he
was
a
sight
;
and
looking
up
as
they
passed
quickly
along
,
could
see
people
running
to
the
windows
a
little
too
late
,
and
throwing
up
the
sashes
to
look
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
he
met
a
staring
face
beyond
the
heads
about
him
,
or
under
the
arms
of
his
conductors
,
or
peering
down
upon
him
from
a
waggon
-
top
or
coach
-
box
;
but
this
was
all
he
saw
,
being
surrounded
by
so
many
men
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
noises
of
the
streets
seemed
muffled
and
subdued
;
and
the
air
came
stale
and
hot
upon
him
,
like
the
sickly
breath
of
an
oven
.
  
<EOS>
Tramp
,
tramp
.
 
<EOS>
Tramp
,
tramp
.
 
<EOS>
Heads
erect
,
shoulders
square
,
every
man
stepping
in
exact
time
---
all
so
orderly
and
regular
---
<EOS>
nobody
looking
at
him
---
nobody
seeming
conscious
of
his
presence
,
---
he
could
hardly
believe
he
was
a
Prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
But
at
the
word
,
though
only
thought
,
not
spoken
,
he
felt
the
handcuffs
galling
his
wrists
,
the
cord
pressing
his
arms
to
his
sides
:
<EOS>
the
loaded
guns
levelled
at
his
head
;
and
those
cold
,
bright
,
sharp
,
shining
points
turned
towards
him
:
the
mere
looking
down
at
which
,
now
that
he
was
bound
and
helpless
,
made
the
warm
current
of
his
life
run
cold
.

They
were
not
long
in
reaching
the
barracks
,
for
the
officer
who
commanded
the
party
<EOS>
was
desirous
to
avoid
rousing
the
people
by
the
display
of
military
force
in
the
streets
,
and
was
humanely
anxious
to
give
as
little
opportunity
as
possible
for
any
attempt
at
rescue
;
knowing
that
it
must
lead
to
bloodshed
and
loss
of
life
,
and
that
if
the
civil
authorities
by
whom
he
was
accompanied
,
empowered
him
to
order
his
men
to
fire
,
many
innocent
persons
would
probably
fall
,
whom
curiosity
or
idleness
had
attracted
to
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
He
therefore
led
the
party
briskly
on
,
avoiding
with
a
merciful
prudence
the
more
public
and
crowded
thoroughfares
,
and
pursuing
those
which
he
deemed
least
likely
to
be
infested
by
disorderly
persons
.
 
<EOS>
This
wise
proceeding
not
only
enabled
them
to
gain
their
quarters
without
any
interruption
,
but
completely
baffled
a
body
of
rioters
who
had
assembled
in
one
of
the
main
streets
,
through
which
it
was
considered
certain
they
would
pass
,
and
who
remained
gathered
together
for
the
purpose
of
releasing
the
prisoner
from
their
hands
,
long
after
they
had
deposited
him
in
a
place
of
security
,
closed
the
barrack
-
gates
,
and
set
a
double
guard
at
every
entrance
for
its
better
protection
.
  
<EOS>
Arrived
at
this
place
,
poor
Barnaby
was
marched
into
a
stone
-
floored
room
,
where
there
was
a
very
powerful
smell
of
tobacco
,
a
strong
thorough
draught
of
air
,
and
a
great
wooden
bedstead
,
large
enough
for
a
score
of
men
.
 
<EOS>
Several
soldiers
in
undress
were
lounging
about
,
or
eating
from
tin
cans
;
military
accoutrements
dangled
on
rows
of
pegs
along
the
whitewashed
wall
;
and
some
half
-
dozen
men
lay
fast
asleep
upon
their
backs
,
snoring
in
concert
.
<EOS>
After
remaining
here
just
long
enough
to
note
these
things
,
he
was
marched
out
again
,
and
conveyed
across
the
parade
-
ground
to
another
portion
of
the
building
.
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
a
man
never
sees
so
much
at
a
glance
as
when
he
is
in
a
situation
of
extremity
.
 
<EOS>
The
chances
are
a
hundred
to
one
,
that
if
Barnaby
had
lounged
in
at
the
gate
to
look
about
him
,
he
would
have
lounged
out
again
with
a
very
imperfect
idea
of
the
place
,
and
would
have
remembered
very
little
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
he
was
taken
handcuffed
across
the
gravelled
area
,
nothing
escaped
his
notice
.
<EOS>
The
dry
,
arid
look
of
the
dusty
square
,
and
of
the
bare
brick
building
;
the
clothes
hanging
at
some
of
the
windows
;
and
the
men
in
their
shirt
-
sleeves
and
braces
,
lolling
with
half
their
bodies
out
of
the
others
;
the
green
sun
-
blinds
at
the
officers
'
quarters
,
and
the
little
scanty
trees
in
front
;
the
drummer
-
boys
practising
in
a
distant
courtyard
;
the
men
at
drill
on
the
parade
;
the
two
soldiers
carrying
a
basket
between
them
,
who
winked
to
each
other
as
he
went
by
,
and
slily
pointed
to
their
throats
;
the
spruce
serjeant
who
hurried
past
with
a
cane
in
his
hand
,
and
under
his
arm
a
clasped
book
with
a
vellum
cover
;
the
fellows
in
the
ground
-
floor
rooms
,
furbishing
and
brushing
up
their
different
articles
of
dress
,
who
stopped
to
look
at
him
,
and
whose
voices
as
they
spoke
together
echoed
loudly
through
the
empty
galleries
and
passages
;
---
 
everything
,
down
to
the
stand
of
muskets
before
the
guard
-
house
,
and
the
drum
with
a
pipe
-
clayed
belt
attached
,
in
one
corner
,
impressed
itself
upon
his
observation
,
as
though
he
had
noticed
them
in
the
same
place
a
hundred
times
,
or
had
been
a
whole
day
among
them
,
in
place
of
one
brief
hurried
minute
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
taken
into
a
small
paved
back
yard
,
and
there
they
opened
a
great
door
,
plated
with
iron
,
and
pierced
some
five
feet
above
the
ground
with
a
few
holes
to
let
in
air
and
light
.
 
<EOS>
Into
this
dungeon
he
was
walked
straightway
;
and
having
locked
him
up
there
,
and
placed
a
sentry
over
him
,
they
left
him
to
his
meditations
.
  
<EOS>
The
cell
,
or
black
hole
,
for
it
had
those
words
painted
on
the
door
,
was
very
dark
,
and
having
recently
accommodated
a
drunken
deserter
,
by
no
means
clean
.
 
<EOS>
Barnaby
felt
his
way
to
some
straw
at
the
farther
end
,
and
looking
towards
the
door
,
tried
to
accustom
himself
to
the
gloom
,
which
,
coming
from
the
bright
sunshine
out
of
doors
,
was
not
an
easy
task
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
kind
of
portico
or
colonnade
outside
,
and
this
obstructed
even
the
little
light
that
at
the
best
could
have
found
its
way
through
the
small
apertures
in
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
The
footsteps
of
the
sentinel
echoed
monotonously
as
he
paced
its
stone
pavement
to
and
fro
(
reminding
Barnaby
of
the
watch
he
had
so
lately
kept
himself
)
;
and
as
he
passed
and
repassed
the
door
,
he
made
the
cell
for
an
instant
so
black
by
the
interposition
of
his
body
,
that
his
going
away
again
seemed
like
the
appearance
of
a
new
ray
of
light
,
and
was
quite
a
circumstance
to
look
for
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
prisoner
had
sat
sometime
upon
the
ground
,
gazing
at
the
chinks
,
and
listening
to
the
advancing
and
receding
footsteps
of
his
guard
,
the
man
stood
still
upon
his
post
.
 
<EOS>
Barnaby
,
quite
unable
to
think
,
or
to
speculate
on
what
would
be
done
with
him
,
had
been
lulled
into
a
kind
of
doze
by
his
regular
pace
;
but
his
stopping
roused
him
;
and
then
he
became
aware
that
two
men
were
in
conversation
under
the
colonnade
,
and
very
near
the
door
of
his
cell
.
  
<EOS>
How
long
they
had
been
talking
there
,
he
could
not
tell
,
for
he
had
fallen
into
an
unconsciousness
of
his
real
position
,
and
when
the
footsteps
ceased
,
was
answering
aloud
some
question
which
seemed
to
have
been
put
to
him
by
Hugh
in
the
stable
,
though
of
the
fancied
purport
,
either
of
question
or
reply
,
notwithstanding
that
he
awoke
with
the
latter
on
his
lips
,
he
had
no
recollection
whatever
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
words
that
reached
his
ears
,
were
these
:
  
<EOS>
"
Why
is
he
brought
here
then
,
if
he
has
to
be
taken
away
again
so
soon
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
where
would
you
have
him
go
!
 
<EOS>
Damme
,
he
's
not
as
safe
anywhere
as
among
the
king
's
troops
,
is
he
?
 
<EOS>
What
WOULD
you
do
with
him
?
<EOS>
Would
you
hand
him
over
to
a
pack
of
cowardly
civilians
,
that
shake
in
their
shoes
till
they
wear
the
soles
out
,
with
trembling
at
the
threats
of
the
ragamuffins
he
belongs
to
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
true
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
True
enough
!
<EOS>
---
I
'll
tell
you
what
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
,
Tom
Green
,
that
I
was
a
commissioned
instead
of
a
non
-
commissioned
officer
,
and
that
I
had
the
command
of
two
companies
---
only
two
companies
---
of
my
own
regiment
.
 
<EOS>
Call
me
out
to
stop
these
riots
---
give
me
the
needful
authority
,
and
half
-
a
-
dozen
rounds
of
ball
cartridge
---
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ay
!
"
said
the
other
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
very
well
,
but
they
wo
n't
give
the
needful
authority
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
magistrate
wo
n't
give
the
word
,
what
's
the
officer
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Not
very
well
knowing
,
as
it
seemed
,
how
to
overcome
this
difficulty
,
the
other
man
contented
himself
with
damning
the
magistrates
.
  
<EOS>
"
With
all
my
heart
,
"
said
his
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
's
the
use
of
a
magistrate
?
"
returned
the
other
voice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
's
a
magistrate
in
this
case
,
but
an
impertinent
,
unnecessary
,
unconstitutional
sort
of
interference
?
 
<EOS>
Here
's
a
proclamation
.
<EOS>
Here
's
a
man
referred
to
in
that
proclamation
.
 
<EOS>
Here
's
proof
against
him
,
and
a
witness
on
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
Damme
!
 
<EOS>
Take
him
out
and
shoot
him
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Who
wants
a
magistrate
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
does
he
go
before
Sir
John
Fielding
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
man
who
had
spoken
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
-
night
at
eight
o'clock
,
"
returned
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mark
what
follows
.
 
<EOS>
The
magistrate
commits
him
to
Newgate
.
 
<EOS>
Our
people
take
him
to
Newgate
.
 
<EOS>
The
rioters
pelt
our
people
.
 
<EOS>
Our
people
retire
before
the
rioters
.
 
<EOS>
Stones
are
thrown
,
insults
are
offered
,
not
a
shot
's
fired
.
 
<EOS>
Why
?
 
<EOS>
Because
of
the
magistrates
.
 
<EOS>
Damn
the
magistrates
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
he
had
in
some
degree
relieved
his
mind
by
cursing
the
magistrates
in
various
other
forms
of
speech
,
the
man
was
silent
,
save
for
a
low
growling
,
still
having
reference
to
those
authorities
,
which
from
time
to
time
escaped
him
.
  
<EOS>
Barnaby
,
who
had
wit
enough
to
know
that
this
conversation
concerned
,
and
very
nearly
concerned
,
himself
,
remained
perfectly
quiet
until
they
ceased
to
speak
,
when
he
groped
his
way
to
the
door
,
and
peeping
through
the
air
-
holes
,
tried
to
make
out
what
kind
of
men
they
were
,
to
whom
he
had
been
listening
.
  
<EOS>
The
one
who
condemned
the
civil
power
in
such
strong
terms
,
was
a
serjeant
---
engaged
just
then
,
as
the
streaming
ribands
in
his
cap
announced
,
on
the
recruiting
service
.
 
<EOS>
He
stood
leaning
sideways
against
a
pillar
nearly
opposite
the
door
,
and
as
he
growled
to
himself
,
drew
figures
on
the
pavement
with
his
cane
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
man
had
his
back
towards
the
dungeon
,
and
Barnaby
could
only
see
his
form
.
 
<EOS>
To
judge
from
that
,
he
was
a
gallant
,
manly
,
handsome
fellow
,
but
he
had
lost
his
left
arm
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
been
taken
off
between
the
elbow
and
the
shoulder
,
and
<EOS>
his
empty
coat
-
sleeve
hung
across
his
breast
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
probably
this
circumstance
which
gave
him
an
interest
beyond
any
that
his
companion
could
boast
of
,
and
attracted
Barnaby
's
attention
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
something
soldierly
in
his
bearing
,
and
he
wore
a
jaunty
cap
and
jacket
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
had
been
in
the
service
at
one
time
or
other
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
had
,
it
could
not
have
been
very
long
ago
,
for
he
was
but
a
young
fellow
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
"
he
said
thoughtfully
;
"
let
the
fault
be
where
it
may
,
it
makes
a
man
sorrowful
to
come
back
to
old
England
,
and
see
her
in
this
condition
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
the
pigs
will
join
'em
next
,
"
said
the
serjeant
,
with
an
imprecation
on
the
rioters
,
"
now
that
the
birds
have
set
'em
the
example
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
birds
!
"
repeated
Tom
Green
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
---
birds
,
"
said
the
serjeant
testily
;
"
that
's
English
,
an't
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Go
to
the
guard
-
house
,
and
see
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
find
a
bird
there
<EOS>
,
that
's
got
their
cry
as
pat
as
any
of
'em
,
and
bawls
"
No
Popery
,
"
like
a
man
---
or
like
a
devil
,
as
he
says
he
is
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
n't
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
The
devil
's
loose
in
London
somewhere
.
 
<EOS>
Damme
if
I
would
n't
twist
his
neck
round
,
on
the
chance
,
if
I
had
MY
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
young
man
had
taken
two
or
three
steps
away
,
as
if
to
go
and
see
this
creature
,
when
he
was
arrested
by
the
voice
of
Barnaby
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
mine
,
"
he
called
out
,
half
laughing
and
half
weeping
---
"
my
pet
,
my
friend
Grip
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
ha
ha
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
hurt
him
,
he
has
done
no
harm
.
 
<EOS>
I
taught
him
;
it
's
my
fault
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
have
him
,
if
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
the
only
friend
I
have
left
now
.
 
<EOS>
He
'll
not
dance
,
or
talk
,
or
whistle
for
you
,
I
know
;
but
he
will
for
me
,
because
he
knows
me
and
loves
me
---
though
you
would
n't
think
it
---
very
well
.
<EOS>
You
would
n't
hurt
a
bird
,
I
'm
sure
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
a
brave
soldier
,
sir
,
and
would
n't
harm
a
woman
or
a
child
---
no
,
no
,
nor
a
poor
bird
,
I
'm
certain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
latter
adjuration
was
addressed
to
the
serjeant
,
whom
Barnaby
judged
from
his
red
coat
to
be
high
in
office
,
and
able
to
seal
Grip
's
destiny
by
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
gentleman
,
in
reply
,
surlily
damned
him
for
a
thief
and
rebel
as
he
was
,
and
with
many
disinterested
imprecations
on
his
own
eyes
,
liver
,
blood
,
and
body
,
assured
him
that
if
it
rested
with
him
to
decide
,
he
would
put
a
final
stopper
on
the
bird
,
and
his
master
too
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
talk
boldly
to
a
caged
man
,
"
said
Barnaby
,
in
anger
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
and
there
were
none
to
part
us
,
you
'd
change
your
note
---
ay
,
you
may
toss
your
head
---
you
would
!
<EOS>
Kill
the
bird
---
do
.
 
<EOS>
Kill
anything
you
can
,
and
so
revenge
yourself
on
those
who
with
their
bare
hands
untied
could
do
as
much
to
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
Having
vented
his
defiance
,
he
flung
himself
into
the
furthest
corner
of
his
prison
,
and
muttering
,
"
<EOS>
Good
bye
,
Grip
---
<EOS>
good
bye
,
dear
old
Grip
!

shed
tears
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
been
taken
captive
;
and
hid
his
face
in
the
straw
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
had
some
fancy
at
first
,
that
the
one
-
armed
man
would
help
him
,
or
would
give
him
a
kind
word
in
answer
.
 
<EOS>
He
hardly
knew
why
,
but
he
hoped
and
thought
so
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
fellow
had
stopped
when
he
called
out
,
and
checking
himself
in
the
very
act
of
turning
round
,
stood
listening
to
every
word
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
built
his
feeble
trust
on
this
;
perhaps
on
his
being
young
,
and
having
a
frank
and
honest
manner
.
 
<EOS>
However
that
might
be
,
he
built
on
sand
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
went
away
<EOS>
directly
he
had
finished
speaking
,
and
neither
answered
him
,
nor
returned
.
 
<EOS>
No
matter
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
all
against
him
here
:
he
might
have
known
as
much
.
 
<EOS>
Good
bye
,
old
Grip
,
<EOS>
good
bye
!
  
<EOS>
After
some
time
,
they
came
and
unlocked
the
door
,
and
called
to
him
to
come
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
rose
directly
,
and
complied
,
for
he
would
not
have
THEM
think
he
was
subdued
or
frightened
.
 
<EOS>
He
walked
out
like
a
man
,
and
looked
from
face
to
face
.
  
<EOS>
None
of
them
returned
his
gaze
or
seemed
to
notice
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
marched
him
back
to
the
parade
by
the
way
they
had
brought
him
,
and
there
they
halted
,
among
a
body
of
soldiers
,
at
least
twice
as
numerous
as
that
which
had
taken
him
prisoner
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
The
officer
he
had
seen
before
,
bade
him
in
a
few
brief
words
take
notice
that
if
he
attempted
to
escape
,
no
matter
how
favourable
a
chance
he
might
suppose
he
had
,
certain
of
the
men
had
orders
to
fire
upon
him
,
that
moment
.
 
<EOS>
They
then
closed
round
him
as
before
,
and
marched
him
off
again
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
same
unbroken
order
they
arrived
at
Bow
Street
,
followed
and
beset
on
all
sides
by
a
crowd
which
was
continually
increasing
.
<EOS>
Here
he
was
placed
before
a
blind
gentleman
,
and
asked
if
he
wished
to
say
anything
.
 
<EOS>
Not
he
.
 
<EOS>
What
had
he
got
to
tell
them
?
 
<EOS>
After
a
very
little
talking
,
which
he
was
careless
of
and
quite
indifferent
to
,
they
told
him
he
was
to
go
to
Newgate
,
and
took
him
away
.
  
<EOS>
He
went
out
into
the
street
,
so
surrounded
and
hemmed
in
on
every
side
by
soldiers
,
that
he
could
see
nothing
;
but
he
knew
there
was
a
great
crowd
of
people
,
by
the
murmur
;
and
that
they
were
not
friendly
to
the
soldiers
,
was
soon
rendered
evident
by
their
yells
and
hisses
.
 
<EOS>
How
often
and
how
eagerly
he
listened
for
the
voice
of
Hugh
!
 
<EOS>
There
was
not
a
voice
he
knew
among
them
all
.
 
<EOS>
Was
Hugh
a
prisoner
too
?
 
<EOS>
Was
there
no
hope
!
  
<EOS>
As
they
came
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
prison
,
the
hootings
of
the
people
grew
more
violent
;
stones
were
thrown
;
and
every
now
and
then
,
a
rush
was
made
against
the
soldiers
,
which
they
staggered
under
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
them
,
close
before
him
,
smarting
under
a
blow
upon
the
temple
,
levelled
his
musket
,
but
the
officer
struck
it
upwards
with
his
sword
,
and
ordered
him
on
peril
of
his
life
to
desist
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
last
thing
he
saw
with
any
distinctness
,
for
directly
afterwards
he
was
tossed
about
,
and
beaten
to
and
fro
,
as
though
in
a
tempestuous
sea
.
 
<EOS>
But
go
where
he
would
,
there
were
the
same
guards
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
Twice
or
thrice
he
was
thrown
down
,
and
so
were
they
;
but
even
then
,
he
could
not
elude
their
vigilance
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
up
again
,
and
had
closed
about
him
,
before
he
,
with
his
wrists
so
tightly
bound
,
could
scramble
to
his
feet
.
<EOS>
Fenced
in
,
thus
,
he
felt
himself
hoisted
to
the
top
of
a
low
flight
of
steps
,
and
then
for
a
moment
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
fighting
in
the
crowd
,
and
of
a
few
red
coats
sprinkled
together
,
here
and
there
,
struggling
to
rejoin
their
fellows
.
 
<EOS>
Next
moment
,
everything
was
dark
and
gloomy
,
and
he
was
standing
in
the
prison
lobby
;
the
centre
of
a
group
of
men
.
  
<EOS>
A
smith
was
speedily
in
attendance
,
who
riveted
upon
him
a
set
of
heavy
irons
.
 
<EOS>
Stumbling
on
as
well
as
he
could
,
beneath
the
unusual
burden
of
these
fetters
,
he
was
conducted
to
a
strong
stone
cell
,
where
,
fastening
the
door
with
locks
,
and
bolts
,
and
chains
,
they
left
him
,
well
secured
;
having
first
,
unseen
by
him
,
thrust
in
Grip
,
who
,
with
his
head
drooping
and
his
deep
black
plumes
rough
and
rumpled
,
appeared
to
comprehend
and
to
partake
,
his
master
's
fallen
fortunes
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
59
    
<EOS>
It
is
necessary
at
this
juncture
to
return
to
Hugh
,
who
,
having
,
as
we
have
seen
,
called
to
the
rioters
to
disperse
from
about
the
Warren
,
and
meet
again
as
usual
,
glided
back
into
the
darkness
from
which
he
had
emerged
,
and
reappeared
no
more
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
He
paused
in
the
copse
which
sheltered
him
from
the
observation
of
his
mad
companions
,
and
waited
to
ascertain
whether
they
drew
off
at
his
bidding
,
or
still
lingered
and
called
to
him
to
join
them
.
<EOS>
Some
few
,
he
saw
,
were
indisposed
to
go
away
without
him
,
and
made
towards
the
spot
where
he
stood
concealed
as
though
they
were
about
to
follow
in
his
footsteps
,
and
urge
him
to
come
back
;
but
these
men
,
being
in
their
turn
called
to
by
their
friends
,
and
in
truth
not
greatly
caring
to
venture
into
the
dark
parts
of
the
grounds
,
where
they
might
be
easily
surprised
and
taken
,
if
any
of
the
neighbours
or
retainers
of
the
family
were
watching
them
from
among
the
trees
,
soon
abandoned
the
idea
,
and
hastily
assembling
such
men
as
they
found
of
their
mind
at
the
moment
,
straggled
off
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
was
satisfied
that
the
great
mass
of
the
insurgents
were
imitating
this
example
,
and
that
the
ground
was
rapidly
clearing
,
he
plunged
into
the
thickest
portion
of
the
little
wood
;
and
,
crashing
the
branches
as
he
went
,
made
straight
towards
a
distant
light
:
guided
by
that
,
and
by
the
sullen
glow
of
the
fire
behind
him
.
  
<EOS>
As
he
drew
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
twinkling
beacon
towards
which
he
bent
his
course
,
the
red
glare
of
a
few
torches
began
to
reveal
itself
,
and
the
voices
of
men
speaking
together
in
a
subdued
tone
broke
the
silence
which
,
save
for
a
distant
shouting
now
and
then
,
already
prevailed
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
he
cleared
the
wood
,
and
,
springing
across
a
ditch
,
stood
in
a
dark
lane
,
where
a
small
body
of
ill
-
looking
vagabonds
,
whom
he
had
left
there
some
twenty
minutes
before
,
waited
his
coming
with
impatience
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
gathered
round
an
old
post
-
chaise
or
chariot
,
driven
by
one
of
themselves
,
who
sat
postilion
-
wise
upon
the
near
horse
.
 
<EOS>
The
blinds
were
drawn
up
,
and
Mr
Tappertit
and
Dennis
kept
guard
at
the
two
windows
.
 
<EOS>
The
former
assumed
the
command
of
the
party
,
for
he
challenged
Hugh
as
he
advanced
towards
them
;
and
when
he
did
so
,
those
who
were
resting
on
the
ground
about
the
carriage
rose
to
their
feet
and
clustered
round
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
Simon
,
in
a
low
voice
;
"
is
all
right
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Right
enough
,
"
replied
Hugh
,
in
the
same
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
're
dispersing
now
---
had
begun
before
I
came
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
is
the
coast
clear
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Clear
enough
before
our
men
,
I
take
it
,
"
said
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
are
not
many
who
,
knowing
of
their
work
over
yonder
,
will
want
to
meddle
with
'em
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
---
Who
's
got
some
drink
here
?
"
  
<EOS>
Everybody
had
some
plunder
from
the
cellar
;
half
-
a
-
dozen
flasks
and
bottles
were
offered
directly
.
 
<EOS>
He
selected
the
largest
,
and
putting
it
to
his
mouth
,
sent
the
wine
gurgling
down
his
throat
.
<EOS>
Having
emptied
it
,
he
threw
it
down
,
and
stretched
out
his
hand
for
another
,
which
he
emptied
likewise
,
at
a
draught
.
 
<EOS>
Another
was
given
him
,
and
this
he
half
emptied
too
.
 
<EOS>
Reserving
what
remained
to
finish
with
<EOS>
,
he
asked
:
  
"
Have
you
got
anything
to
eat
,
any
of
you
?
 
<EOS>
I
'm
as
ravenous
as
a
hungry
wolf
.
 
<EOS>
Which
of
you
was
in
the
larder
---
come
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
,
brother
,
"
said
Dennis
,
pulling
off
his
hat
,
and
fumbling
in
the
crown
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
matter
of
cold
venison
pasty
somewhere
or
another
here
,
if
that
'll
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
!
"
cried
Hugh
,
seating
himself
on
the
pathway
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bring
it
out
!
<EOS>
Quick
!
 
<EOS>
Show
a
light
here
,
and
gather
round
!
 
<EOS>
Let
me
sup
in
state
,
my
lads
!
 
<EOS>
Ha
ha
ha
!
"
  
<EOS>
Entering
into
his
boisterous
humour
,
for
they
all
had
drunk
deeply
,
and
were
as
wild
as
he
,
they
crowded
about
him
,
while
two
of
their
number
who
had
torches
,
held
them
up
,
one
on
either
side
of
him
,
that
his
banquet
might
not
be
despatched
in
the
dark
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dennis
,
having
by
this
time
succeeded
in
extricating
from
his
hat
a
great
mass
of
pasty
,
which
had
been
wedged
in
so
tightly
that
it
was
not
easily
got
out
,
put
it
before
him
;
and
Hugh
,
having
borrowed
a
notched
and
jagged
knife
from
one
of
the
company
,
fell
to
work
upon
it
vigorously
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
recommend
you
to
swallow
a
little
fire
every
day
,
about
an
hour
afore
dinner
,
brother
,
"
said
Dennis
,
after
a
pause
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
seems
to
agree
with
you
,
and
to
stimulate
your
appetite
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
looked
at
him
,
and
at
the
blackened
faces
by
which
he
was
surrounded
,
and
,
stopping
for
a
moment
to
flourish
his
knife
above
his
head
,
answered
with
a
roar
of
laughter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Keep
order
,
there
,
will
you
?
"
said
Simon
Tappertit
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
is
n't
a
man
allowed
to
regale
himself
,
noble
captain
,
"
retorted
his
lieutenant
,
parting
the
men
who
stood
between
them
,
with
his
knife
,
that
he
might
see
him
,
---
"
to
regale
himself
a
little
bit
after
such
work
as
mine
?
 
<EOS>
What
a
hard
captain
!
 
<EOS>
What
a
strict
captain
!
 
<EOS>
What
a
tyrannical
captain
!
 
<EOS>
Ha
ha
ha
!
"
  
"
I
wish
one
of
you
fellers
would
hold
a
bottle
to
his
mouth
to
keep
him
quiet
,
"
said
Simon
,
"
unless
you
want
the
military
to
be
down
upon
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
what
if
they
are
down
upon
us
!
"
retorted
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
cares
?
<EOS>
Who
's
afraid
?
 
<EOS>
Let
'em
come
<EOS>
,
I
say
,
let
'em
come
.
 
<EOS>
The
more
,
the
merrier
.
 
<EOS>
Give
me
bold
Barnaby
at
my
side
,
and
we
two
will
settle
the
military
,
without
troubling
any
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
Barnaby
's
the
man
for
the
military
.
 
<EOS>
Barnaby
's
health
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
as
the
majority
of
those
present
were
by
no
means
anxious
for
a
second
engagement
that
night
,
being
already
weary
and
exhausted
,
they
sided
with
Mr
Tappertit
,
and
pressed
him
to
make
haste
with
his
supper
,
for
they
had
already
delayed
too
long
.
 
<EOS>
Knowing
,
even
in
the
height
of
his
frenzy
,
that
they
incurred
great
danger
by
lingering
so
near
the
scene
of
the
late
outrages
,
Hugh
made
an
end
of
his
meal
without
more
remonstrance
,
and
rising
,
stepped
up
to
Mr
Tappertit
,
and
smote
him
on
the
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
then
,
"
he
cried
,
"
I
'm
ready
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
brave
birds
inside
this
cage
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
Delicate
birds
,
---
tender
,
loving
,
little
doves
.
 
<EOS>
I
caged
'em
<EOS>
---
I
caged
'em
---
one
more
peep
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
thrust
the
little
man
aside
as
he
spoke
,
and
mounting
on
the
steps
,
which
were
half
let
down
,
pulled
down
the
blind
by
force
,
and
stared
into
the
chaise
like
an
ogre
into
his
larder
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
ha
ha
!
<EOS>
and
did
you
scratch
,
and
pinch
,
and
struggle
,
pretty
mistress
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
as
he
grasped
a
little
hand
that
sought
in
vain
to
free
itself
from
his
grip
:
"
you
,
so
bright
-
eyed
,
and
cherry
-
lipped
,
and
daintily
made
?
 
<EOS>
But
I
love
you
better
for
it
,
mistress
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
You
should
stab
me
and
welcome
,
so
that
it
pleased
you
,
and
you
had
to
cure
me
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
I
love
to
see
you
proud
and
scornful
.
 
<EOS>
It
makes
you
handsomer
than
ever
;
and
who
so
handsome
as
you
at
any
time
,
my
pretty
one
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
!
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
,
who
had
waited
during
this
speech
with
considerable
impatience
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
enough
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
Come
down
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
little
hand
seconded
this
admonition
by
thrusting
Hugh
's
great
head
away
with
all
its
force
,
and
drawing
up
the
blind
,
amidst
his
noisy
laughter
,
and
vows
that
he
must
have
another
look
,
for
the
last
glimpse
of
that
sweet
face
had
provoked
him
past
all
bearing
.
<EOS>
However
,
as
the
suppressed
impatience
of
the
party
now
broke
out
into
open
murmurs
,
he
abandoned
this
design
,
and
taking
his
seat
upon
the
bar
,
contented
himself
with
tapping
at
the
front
windows
of
the
carriage
,
and
trying
to
steal
a
glance
inside
;
Mr
Tappertit
,
mounting
the
steps
and
hanging
on
by
the
door
,
issued
his
directions
to
the
driver
with
a
commanding
voice
and
attitude
;
the
rest
got
up
behind
,
or
ran
by
the
side
of
the
carriage
,
as
they
could
;
some
,
in
imitation
of
Hugh
,
endeavoured
to
see
the
face
he
had
praised
so
highly
,
and
were
reminded
of
their
impertinence
by
hints
from
the
cudgel
of
Mr
Tappertit
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
they
pursued
their
journey
by
circuitous
and
winding
roads
;
preserving
,
except
when
they
halted
to
take
breath
,
or
to
quarrel
about
the
best
way
of
reaching
London
,
pretty
good
order
and
tolerable
silence
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
Dolly
---
beautiful
,
bewitching
,
captivating
little
Dolly
---
her
hair
dishevelled
,
her
dress
torn
,
<EOS>
her
dark
eyelashes
wet
with
tears
,
<EOS>
her
bosom
heaving
---
<EOS>
her
face
,
now
pale
with
fear
,
now
crimsoned
with
indignation
---
her
whole
self
a
hundred
times
more
beautiful
in
this
heightened
aspect
than
ever
she
had
been
before
---
 
vainly
strove
to
comfort
Emma
Haredale
,
and
to
impart
to
her
the
consolation
of
which
she
stood
in
so
much
need
herself
.
 
<EOS>
The
soldiers
were
sure
to
come
;
they
must
be
rescued
;
it
would
be
impossible
to
convey
them
through
the
streets
of
London
when
they
set
the
threats
of
their
guards
at
defiance
,
and
shrieked
to
the
passengers
for
help
.
 
<EOS>
If
they
did
this
when
they
came
into
the
more
frequented
ways
,
she
was
certain
---
<EOS>
she
was
quite
certain
---
they
must
be
released
.
 
<EOS>
So
poor
Dolly
said
,
and
so
poor
Dolly
tried
to
think
;
but
the
invariable
conclusion
of
all
such
arguments
was
,
that
Dolly
burst
into
tears
;
cried
,
as
she
wrung
her
hands
,
what
would
they
do
or
think
,
or
who
would
comfort
them
,
at
home
,
at
the
Golden
Key
;
and
sobbed
most
piteously
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Haredale
,
whose
feelings
were
usually
of
a
quieter
kind
than
Dolly
's
,
and
not
so
much
upon
the
surface
,
was
dreadfully
alarmed
,
and
indeed
had
only
just
recovered
from
a
swoon
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
very
pale
,
and
the
hand
which
Dolly
held
was
quite
cold
;
but
she
bade
her
,
nevertheless
,
remember
that
,
under
Providence
,
much
must
depend
upon
their
own
discretion
;
that
if
they
remained
quiet
and
lulled
the
vigilance
of
the
ruffians
into
whose
hands
they
had
fallen
,
the
chances
of
their
being
able
to
procure
assistance
when
they
reached
the
town
,
were
very
much
increased
;
that
unless
society
were
quite
unhinged
,
a
hot
pursuit
must
be
immediately
commenced
;
and
that
her
uncle
,
she
might
be
sure
,
would
never
rest
until
he
had
found
them
out
and
rescued
them
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
she
said
these
latter
words
,
the
idea
that
he
had
fallen
in
a
general
massacre
of
the
Catholics
that
night
---
no
very
wild
or
improbable
supposition
after
what
they
had
seen
and
undergone
---
struck
her
dumb
;
and
,
lost
in
the
horrors
they
had
witnessed
,
and
those
they
might
be
yet
reserved
for
,
she
sat
incapable
of
thought
,
or
speech
,
or
outward
show
of
grief
:
as
rigid
,
and
almost
as
white
and
cold
,
as
marble
.
  
<EOS>
Oh
,
how
many
,
many
times
,
in
that
long
ride
,
did
Dolly
think
of
her
old
lover
,
---
poor
,
fond
,
slighted
Joe
!
 
<EOS>
How
many
,
many
times
,
did
she
recall
that
night
when
she
ran
into
his
arms
from
the
very
man
now
projecting
his
hateful
gaze
into
the
darkness
where
she
sat
,
and
leering
through
the
glass
in
monstrous
admiration
!
 
<EOS>
And
when
she
thought
of
Joe
,
and
what
a
brave
fellow
he
was
,
and
how
he
would
have
rode
boldly
up
,
and
dashed
in
among
these
villains
now
,
<EOS>
yes
,
though
they
were
double
the
number
---
and
here
she
clenched
her
little
hand
,
and
pressed
her
foot
upon
the
ground
---
the
pride
she
felt
for
a
moment
in
having
won
his
heart
,
faded
in
a
burst
of
tears
,
and
she
sobbed
more
bitterly
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
night
wore
on
,
and
they
proceeded
by
ways
which
were
quite
unknown
to
them
---
for
they
could
recognise
none
of
the
objects
of
which
they
sometimes
caught
a
hurried
glimpse
---
their
fears
increased
;
nor
were
they
without
good
foundation
;
it
was
not
difficult
for
two
beautiful
young
women
to
find
,
<EOS>
in
their
being
borne
they
knew
not
whither
by
a
band
of
daring
villains
who
eyed
them
as
some
among
these
fellows
did
,
reasons
for
the
worst
alarm
.
<EOS>
When
they
at
last
entered
London
,
by
a
suburb
with
which
they
were
wholly
unacquainted
,
it
was
past
midnight
,
and
the
streets
were
dark
and
empty
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
this
the
worst
,
for
the
carriage
stopping
in
a
lonely
spot
,
Hugh
suddenly
opened
the
door
,
jumped
in
,
and
took
his
seat
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
they
cried
for
help
.
 
<EOS>
He
put
his
arm
about
the
neck
of
each
,
and
swore
to
stifle
them
with
kisses
if
they
were
not
as
silent
as
the
grave
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
come
here
to
keep
you
quiet
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
that
's
the
means
I
shall
take
.
 
<EOS>
So
do
n't
be
quiet
,
pretty
mistresses
---
make
a
noise
---
 
<EOS>
do
---
<EOS>
and
I
shall
like
it
<EOS>
all
the
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
proceeding
at
a
rapid
pace
,
and
apparently
with
fewer
attendants
than
before
,
though
it
was
so
dark
(
the
torches
being
extinguished
)
that
this
was
mere
conjecture
.
 
<EOS>
They
shrunk
from
his
touch
,
each
into
the
farthest
corner
of
the
carriage
;
but
shrink
as
Dolly
would
,
his
arm
encircled
her
waist
,
and
held
her
fast
.
 
<EOS>
She
neither
cried
nor
spoke
,
for
terror
and
disgust
deprived
her
of
the
power
;
but
she
plucked
at
his
hand
as
though
she
would
die
in
the
effort
to
disengage
herself
;
and
crouching
on
the
ground
,
with
her
head
averted
and
held
down
,
repelled
him
with
a
strength
she
wondered
at
as
much
as
he
.
 
<EOS>
The
carriage
stopped
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lift
this
one
out
,
"
said
Hugh
to
the
man
who
opened
the
door
,
as
he
took
Miss
Haredale
's
hand
,
and
felt
how
heavily
it
fell
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
's
fainted
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
much
the
better
,
"
growled
Dennis
---
it
was
that
amiable
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
's
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
I
always
like
'em
to
faint
,
unless
they
're
very
tender
and
composed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
take
her
by
yourself
?
"
asked
Hugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
till
I
try
.
 
<EOS>
I
ought
to
be
able
to
;
I
've
lifted
up
a
good
many
in
my
time
,
"
said
the
hangman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Up
then
!
 
<EOS>
She
's
no
small
weight
,
brother
;
none
of
these
here
fine
gals
are
.
 
<EOS>
Up
again
!
 
<EOS>
Now
we
have
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Having
by
this
time
hoisted
the
young
lady
into
his
arms
,
he
staggered
off
with
his
burden
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
ye
,
pretty
bird
,
"
said
Hugh
,
drawing
Dolly
towards
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Remember
what
I
told
you
---
a
kiss
for
every
cry
.
 
<EOS>
Scream
,
if
you
love
me
,
darling
.
 
<EOS>
Scream
once
,
mistress
.
 
<EOS>
Pretty
mistress
,
only
once
,
if
you
love
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Thrusting
his
face
away
with
all
her
force
,
and
holding
down
her
head
,
Dolly
submitted
to
be
carried
out
of
the
chaise
,
and
borne
after
Miss
Haredale
into
a
miserable
cottage
,
where
Hugh
,
after
hugging
her
to
his
breast
,
set
her
gently
down
upon
the
floor
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Dolly
!
 
<EOS>
Do
what
she
would
,
she
only
looked
the
better
for
it
,
and
tempted
them
the
more
.
 
<EOS>
When
her
eyes
flashed
angrily
,
and
her
ripe
lips
slightly
parted
,
to
give
her
rapid
breathing
vent
,
who
could
resist
it
?
 
<EOS>
When
she
wept
and
sobbed
as
though
her
heart
would
break
,
and
bemoaned
her
miseries
in
the
sweetest
voice
that
ever
fell
upon
a
listener
's
ear
,
who
could
be
insensible
to
the
little
winning
pettishness
which
now
and
then
displayed
itself
,
even
in
the
sincerity
and
earnestness
of
her
grief
?
 
<EOS>
When
,
forgetful
for
a
moment
of
herself
,
as
she
was
now
,
she
fell
on
her
knees
beside
her
friend
,
and
bent
over
her
,
and
laid
her
cheek
to
hers
,
and
put
her
arms
about
her
,
what
mortal
eyes
could
have
avoided
wandering
to
the
delicate
bodice
,
the
streaming
hair
,
the
neglected
dress
,
the
perfect
abandonment
and
unconsciousness
of
the
blooming
little
beauty
?
 
<EOS>
Who
could
look
on
and
see
her
lavish
caresses
and
endearments
,
and
not
desire
to
be
in
Emma
Haredale
's
place
;
to
be
either
her
or
Dolly
;
either
the
hugging
or
the
hugged
?
<EOS>
Not
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
Not
Dennis
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
what
it
is
,
young
women
,
"
said
Mr
Dennis
,
"
I
an't
much
of
a
lady
's
man
myself
,
nor
am
I
a
party
in
the
present
business
further
than
lending
a
willing
hand
to
my
friends
:
<EOS>
but
if
I
see
much
more
of
this
here
sort
of
thing
,
I
shall
become
a
principal
instead
of
a
accessory
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
candid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
have
you
brought
us
here
?
"
said
Emma
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
we
to
be
murdered
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Murdered
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Dennis
,
sitting
down
upon
a
stool
,
and
regarding
her
with
great
favour
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
my
dear
,
who
'd
murder
sich
chickabiddies
as
you
?
 
<EOS>
If
you
was
to
ask
me
,
now
,
whether
you
was
brought
here
to
be
married
,
there
might
be
something
in
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
here
he
exchanged
a
grin
with
Hugh
,
who
removed
his
eyes
from
Dolly
for
the
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
Dennis
,
"
there
'll
be
no
murdering
,
my
pets
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
of
that
sort
.
 
<EOS>
Quite
the
contrairy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
an
older
man
than
your
companion
,
sir
,
"
said
Emma
,
trembling
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
no
pity
for
us
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
not
consider
that
we
are
women
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
indeed
,
my
dear
,
"
retorted
Dennis
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
very
hard
not
to
,
with
two
such
specimens
afore
my
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
ha
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
yes
,
I
consider
that
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
consider
that
,
miss
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
shook
his
head
waggishly
,
leered
at
Hugh
again
,
and
laughed
very
much
,
as
if
he
had
said
a
noble
thing
,
and
rather
thought
he
was
coming
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
'll
be
no
murdering
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
bit
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
what
though
,
brother
,
"
said
Dennis
,
cocking
his
hat
for
the
convenience
of
scratching
his
head
,
and
looking
gravely
at
Hugh
<EOS>
,
"
it
's
worthy
of
notice
,
as
a
proof
of
the
amazing
equalness
and
dignity
of
our
law
,
that
it
do
n't
make
no
distinction
between
men
and
women
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
heerd
the
judge
say
,
sometimes
,
to
a
highwayman
or
housebreaker
as
had
tied
the
ladies
neck
and
heels
<EOS>
---
you
'll
excuse
me
making
mention
of
it
,
my
darlings
---
and
put
'em
in
a
cellar
,
that
he
showed
no
consideration
to
women
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
I
say
that
there
judge
did
n't
know
his
business
,
brother
;
and
that
if
I
had
been
that
there
highwayman
or
housebreaker
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
made
answer
:
"
<EOS>
What
are
you
a
talking
of
,
my
lord
?
 
<EOS>
I
showed
the
women
as
much
consideration
as
the
law
does
,
and
what
more
would
you
have
me
do
?
<EOS>
"
If
you
was
to
count
up
in
the
newspapers
the
number
of
females
as
have
been
worked
off
in
this
here
city
alone
,
in
the
last
ten
year
,
"
said
Mr
Dennis
thoughtfully
,
"
you
'd
be
surprised
at
the
total
---
quite
amazed
<EOS>
,
you
would
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
a
dignified
and
equal
thing
;
a
beautiful
thing
!
 
<EOS>
But
we
've
no
security
for
its
lasting
.
<EOS>
Now
that
they
've
begun
to
favour
these
here
Papists
,
I
should
n't
wonder
if
they
went
and
altered
even
THAT
,
one
of
these
days
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
my
soul
,
I
should
n't
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
subject
,
perhaps
from
being
of
too
exclusive
and
professional
a
nature
,
failed
to
interest
Hugh
as
much
as
his
friend
had
anticipated
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
had
no
time
to
pursue
it
,
for
at
this
crisis
Mr
Tappertit
entered
precipitately
;
at
sight
of
whom
Dolly
uttered
a
scream
of
joy
,
and
fairly
threw
herself
into
his
arms
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
knew
it
,
I
was
sure
of
it
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Dolly
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
father
's
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Thank
God
,
thank
God
!
 
<EOS>
Bless
you
,
Sim
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
bless
you
for
this
!
"
  
<EOS>
Simon
Tappertit
,
who
had
at
first
implicitly
believed
that
the
locksmith
's
daughter
,
unable
any
longer
to
suppress
her
secret
passion
for
himself
,
was
about
to
give
it
full
vent
in
its
intensity
,
and
to
declare
that
she
was
his
for
ever
,
looked
extremely
foolish
when
she
said
these
words
;
---
the
more
so
,
as
they
were
received
by
Hugh
and
Dennis
with
a
loud
laugh
,
which
made
her
draw
back
,
and
regard
him
with
a
fixed
and
earnest
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Haredale
,
"
said
Sim
,
after
a
very
awkward
silence
,
"
I
hope
you
're
as
comfortable
as
circumstances
will
permit
of
.
 
<EOS>
Dolly
Varden
,
my
darling
---
my
own
,
my
lovely
one
<EOS>
---
I
hope
YOU'RE
pretty
comfortable
likewise
.
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
little
Dolly
!
 
<EOS>
She
saw
how
it
was
;
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
;
and
sobbed
more
bitterly
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
meet
in
me
,
Miss
V
,
"
said
Simon
,
laying
his
hand
upon
his
breast
,
"
not
a
"
prentice
,
not
a
workman
,
not
a
slave
,
not
the
wictim
of
your
father
's
tyrannical
behaviour
,
but
the
leader
of
a
great
people
,
the
captain
of
a
noble
band
,
in
which
these
gentlemen
are
,
as
I
may
say
,
corporals
and
serjeants
.
 
<EOS>
You
behold
in
me
,
not
a
private
individual
,
but
a
public
character
;
not
a
mender
of
locks
,
but
a
healer
of
the
wounds
of
his
unhappy
country
.
 
<EOS>
Dolly
V
,
sweet
Dolly
V
,
for
how
many
years
<EOS>
have
I
looked
forward
to
this
present
meeting
!
 
<EOS>
For
how
many
years
has
it
been
my
intention
to
exalt
and
ennoble
you
!
 
<EOS>
I
redeem
it
.
 
<EOS>
Behold
in
me
,
your
husband
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
beautiful
Dolly
---
charmer
---
enslaver
<EOS>
---
S
Tappertit
is
all
your
own
!
"
  
<EOS>
As
he
said
these
words
he
advanced
towards
her
.
 
<EOS>
Dolly
retreated
till
she
could
go
no
farther
,
and
then
sank
down
upon
the
floor
.
<EOS>
Thinking
it
very
possible
that
this
might
be
maiden
modesty
,
Simon
essayed
to
raise
her
;
on
which
Dolly
,
goaded
to
desperation
,
wound
her
hands
in
his
hair
,
and
crying
out
amidst
her
tears
that
he
was
a
dreadful
little
wretch
,
and
always
had
been
,
shook
,
and
pulled
,
and
beat
him
,
until
he
was
fain
to
call
for
help
,
most
lustily
.
<EOS>
Hugh
had
never
admired
her
half
so
much
as
at
that
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
in
an
excited
state
to
-
night
,
"
said
Simon
,
as
he
smoothed
his
rumpled
feathers
,
"
and
do
n't
know
when
she
's
well
off
.
 
<EOS>
Let
her
be
by
herself
till
to
-
morrow
,
and
that
'll
bring
her
down
a
little
.
<EOS>
Carry
her
into
the
next
house
!
"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
had
her
in
his
arms
directly
.
 
<EOS>
It
might
be
that
Mr
Tappertit
's
heart
was
really
softened
by
her
distress
,
or
it
might
be
that
he
felt
it
in
some
degree
indecorous
that
his
intended
bride
should
be
struggling
in
the
grasp
of
another
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
commanded
him
,
on
second
thoughts
,
to
put
her
down
again
,
and
looked
moodily
on
as
she
flew
to
Miss
Haredale
's
side
,
and
clinging
to
her
dress
,
hid
her
flushed
face
in
its
folds
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
shall
remain
here
together
till
to
-
morrow
,
"
said
Simon
,
who
had
now
quite
recovered
his
dignity
---
"
till
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
Come
away
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
"
cried
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
away
,
captain
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
ha
ha
!
"
  
"
What
are
you
laughing
at
?
"
demanded
Simon
sternly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
captain
,
nothing
<EOS>
,
"
Hugh
rejoined
;
and
as
he
spoke
,
and
clapped
his
hand
upon
the
shoulder
of
the
little
man
,
he
laughed
again
,
for
some
unknown
reason
,
with
tenfold
violence
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Tappertit
surveyed
him
from
head
to
foot
with
lofty
scorn
(
this
only
made
him
laugh
the
more
)
,
and
turning
to
the
prisoners
,
said
:
  
"
You
'll
take
notice
,
ladies
,
that
this
place
is
well
watched
on
every
side
,
and
that
the
least
noise
is
certain
to
be
attended
with
unpleasant
consequences
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
hear
---
both
of
you
---
<EOS>
more
of
our
intentions
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
do
n't
show
yourselves
at
the
window
,
or
appeal
to
any
of
the
people
you
may
see
pass
it
;
for
if
you
do
,
it
'll
be
known
directly
that
you
come
from
a
Catholic
house
,
and
all
the
exertions
our
men
can
make
,
may
not
be
able
to
save
your
lives
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
this
last
caution
,
which
was
true
enough
,
he
turned
to
the
door
,
followed
by
Hugh
and
Dennis
.
 
<EOS>
They
paused
for
a
moment
,
going
out
,
to
look
at
them
clasped
in
each
other
's
arms
,
and
then
left
the
cottage
;
fastening
the
door
,
and
setting
a
good
watch
upon
it
,
and
indeed
all
round
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
growled
Dennis
,
as
they
walked
away
in
company
,
"
that
's
a
dainty
pair
.
 
<EOS>
Muster
Gashford
's
one
is
as
handsome
as
the
other
,
eh
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
said
Hugh
,
hastily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
mention
names
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
bad
habit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
n't
like
to
be
HIM
,
then
(
as
you
do
n't
like
names
)
,
when
he
breaks
it
out
to
her
;
that
's
all
,
"
said
Dennis
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
's
one
of
them
fine
,
black
-
eyed
,
proud
gals
,
as
I
would
n't
trust
at
such
times
with
a
knife
too
near
'em
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
seen
some
of
that
sort
,
afore
now
.
<EOS>
I
recollect
one
that
was
worked
off
,
many
year
ago
---
and
there
was
a
gentleman
in
that
case
too
---
<EOS>
that
says
to
me
,
with
her
lip
a
trembling
,
but
her
hand
as
steady
as
ever
<EOS>
I
see
one
:
"
<EOS>
Dennis
,
I
'm
near
my
end
,
but
if
I
had
a
dagger
in
these
fingers
,
and
he
was
within
my
reach
,
I
'd
strike
him
dead
afore
me
;
"
---
<EOS>
ah
,
she
did
---
<EOS>
and
she
'd
have
done
it
too
!
"
  
<EOS>
Strike
who
dead
?
"
demanded
Hugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
should
I
know
,
brother
?
"
answered
Dennis
.
 
<EOS>
"
SHE
never
said
;
not
she
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
looked
,
for
a
moment
,
as
though
he
would
have
made
some
further
inquiry
into
this
incoherent
recollection
;
but
Simon
Tappertit
,
who
had
been
meditating
deeply
,
gave
his
thoughts
a
new
direction
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hugh
!
"
said
Sim
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
done
well
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
be
rewarded
.
 
<EOS>
So
have
you
,
Dennis
.
<EOS>
---
There
's
no
young
woman
YOU
want
to
carry
off
,
is
there
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
N
---
<EOS>
no
,
"
returned
that
gentleman
,
stroking
his
grizzly
beard
,
which
was
some
two
inches
long
.
 
<EOS>
"
None
in
partickler
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
"
said
Sim
;
"
then
we
'll
find
some
other
way
of
making
it
up
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
you
,
old
boy
"
<EOS>
---
he
turned
to
Hugh
---
<EOS>
"
you
shall
have
Miggs
(
her
that
I
promised
you
,
you
know
)
within
three
days
.
 
<EOS>
Mind
.
<EOS>
I
pass
my
word
for
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
thanked
him
heartily
;
and
as
he
did
so
,
his
laughing
fit
returned
with
such
violence
that
he
was
obliged
to
hold
his
side
with
one
hand
,
and
to
lean
with
the
other
on
the
shoulder
of
his
small
captain
,
without
whose
support
he
would
certainly
have
rolled
upon
the
ground
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
60
    
<EOS>
The
three
worthies
turned
their
faces
towards
The
Boot
,
with
the
intention
of
passing
the
night
in
that
place
of
rendezvous
,
and
of
seeking
the
repose
they
so
much
needed
in
the
shelter
of
their
old
den
;
for
now
that
the
mischief
and
destruction
they
had
purposed
were
achieved
,
and
their
prisoners
were
safely
bestowed
for
the
night
,
they
began
to
be
conscious
of
exhaustion
,
and
to
feel
the
wasting
effects
of
the
madness
which
had
led
to
such
deplorable
results
.
  
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
lassitude
and
fatigue
which
oppressed
him
now
,
in
common
with
his
two
companions
,
and
indeed
with
all
who
had
taken
an
active
share
in
that
night
's
work
,
Hugh
's
boisterous
merriment
broke
out
afresh
whenever
he
looked
at
Simon
Tappertit
,
and
vented
itself
---
much
to
that
gentleman
's
indignation
---
in
such
shouts
of
laughter
as
bade
fair
to
bring
the
watch
upon
them
,
and
involve
them
in
a
skirmish
,
to
which
in
their
present
worn
-
out
condition
they
might
prove
by
no
means
equal
.
 
<EOS>
Even
Mr
Dennis
,
who
was
not
at
all
particular
on
the
score
of
gravity
or
dignity
,
and
who
had
a
great
relish
for
his
young
friend
's
eccentric
humours
,
took
occasion
to
remonstrate
with
him
on
this
imprudent
behaviour
,
which
he
held
to
be
a
species
of
suicide
,
tantamount
to
a
man
's
working
himself
off
without
being
overtaken
by
the
law
,
than
which
he
could
imagine
nothing
more
ridiculous
or
impertinent
.
  
<EOS>
Not
abating
one
jot
of
his
noisy
mirth
for
these
remonstrances
,
Hugh
reeled
along
between
them
,
having
an
arm
of
each
,
until
they
hove
in
sight
of
The
Boot
,
and
were
within
a
field
or
two
of
that
convenient
tavern
.
 
<EOS>
He
happened
by
great
good
luck
to
have
roared
and
shouted
himself
into
silence
by
this
time
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
proceeding
onward
without
noise
,
when
a
scout
who
had
been
creeping
about
the
ditches
all
night
,
to
warn
any
stragglers
from
encroaching
further
on
what
was
now
such
dangerous
ground
,
peeped
cautiously
from
his
hiding
-
place
,
and
called
to
them
to
stop
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stop
!
<EOS>
and
why
?
<EOS>
"
said
Hugh
.
  
<EOS>
Because
(
the
scout
replied
)
<EOS>
the
house
was
filled
with
constables
and
soldiers
;
having
been
surprised
that
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
The
inmates
had
fled
or
been
taken
into
custody
,
he
could
not
say
which
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
prevented
a
great
many
people
from
approaching
nearer
,
and
he
believed
they
had
gone
to
the
markets
and
such
places
to
pass
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
seen
the
distant
fires
,
but
they
were
all
out
now
.
<EOS>
He
had
heard
the
people
who
passed
and
repassed
,
speaking
of
them
too
,
and
could
report
that
the
prevailing
opinion
was
one
of
apprehension
and
dismay
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
not
heard
a
word
of
Barnaby
---
 
<EOS>
did
n't
even
know
his
name
---
but
it
had
been
said
in
his
hearing
that
some
man
had
been
taken
and
carried
off
to
Newgate
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
this
was
true
or
false
,
he
could
not
affirm
.
  
<EOS>
The
three
took
counsel
together
,
on
hearing
this
,
and
debated
what
it
might
be
best
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
Hugh
,
deeming
it
possible
that
Barnaby
was
in
the
hands
of
the
soldiers
,
and
at
that
moment
under
detention
at
The
Boot
,
was
for
advancing
stealthily
,
and
firing
the
house
;
but
his
companions
,
who
objected
to
such
rash
measures
unless
they
had
a
crowd
at
their
backs
,
represented
that
if
Barnaby
were
taken
he
had
assuredly
been
removed
to
a
stronger
prison
;
they
would
never
have
dreamed
of
keeping
him
all
night
in
a
place
so
weak
and
open
to
attack
.
 
<EOS>
Yielding
to
this
reasoning
,
and
to
their
persuasions
,
Hugh
consented
to
turn
back
and
to
repair
to
Fleet
Market
;
for
which
place
,
it
seemed
,
a
few
of
their
boldest
associates
had
shaped
their
course
,
on
receiving
the
same
intelligence
.
  
<EOS>
Feeling
their
strength
recruited
and
their
spirits
roused
,
now
that
there
was
a
new
necessity
for
action
,
they
hurried
away
,
quite
forgetful
of
the
fatigue
under
which
they
had
been
sinking
but
a
few
minutes
before
;
and
soon
arrived
at
their
new
place
of
destination
.
  
<EOS>
Fleet
Market
,
at
that
time
,
was
a
long
irregular
row
of
wooden
sheds
and
penthouses
,
occupying
the
centre
of
what
is
now
called
Farringdon
Street
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
jumbled
together
in
a
most
unsightly
fashion
,
in
the
middle
of
the
road
;
to
the
great
obstruction
of
the
thoroughfare
and
the
annoyance
of
passengers
,
who
were
fain
to
make
their
way
,
as
they
best
could
,
among
carts
,
baskets
,
barrows
,
trucks
,
casks
,
bulks
,
and
benches
,
and
to
jostle
with
porters
,
hucksters
,
waggoners
,
and
a
motley
crowd
of
buyers
,
sellers
,
pick
-
pockets
,
vagrants
,
and
idlers
.
 
<EOS>
The
air
was
perfumed
with
the
stench
of
rotten
leaves
and
faded
fruit
;
the
refuse
of
the
butchers
'
stalls
,
and
offal
and
garbage
of
a
hundred
kinds
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
indispensable
to
most
public
conveniences
in
those
days
,
that
they
should
be
public
nuisances
likewise
;
and
Fleet
Market
maintained
the
principle
to
admiration
.
  
<EOS>
To
this
place
,
perhaps
because
its
sheds
and
baskets
were
a
tolerable
substitute
for
beds
,
or
perhaps
because
it
afforded
the
means
of
a
hasty
barricade
in
case
of
need
,
many
of
the
rioters
had
straggled
,
not
only
that
night
,
but
for
two
or
three
nights
before
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
broad
day
,
but
the
morning
being
cold
,
a
group
of
them
were
gathered
round
a
fire
in
a
public
-
house
,
drinking
hot
purl
,
and
smoking
pipes
,
and
planning
new
schemes
for
to
-
morrow
.
  
<EOS>
Hugh
and
his
two
friends
being
known
to
most
of
these
men
,
were
received
with
signal
marks
of
approbation
,
and
inducted
into
the
most
honourable
seats
.
 
<EOS>
The
room
-
door
was
closed
and
fastened
to
keep
intruders
at
a
distance
,
and
then
they
proceeded
to
exchange
news
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
soldiers
have
taken
possession
of
The
Boot
,
I
hear
,
"
said
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
knows
anything
about
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Several
cried
that
they
did
;
but
the
majority
of
the
company
having
been
engaged
in
the
assault
upon
the
Warren
,
and
all
present
having
been
concerned
in
one
or
other
of
the
night
's
expeditions
,
it
proved
that
they
knew
no
more
than
Hugh
himself
;
having
been
merely
warned
by
each
other
,
or
by
the
scout
,
and
knowing
nothing
of
their
own
knowledge
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
left
a
man
on
guard
there
to
-
day
,
"
said
Hugh
,
looking
round
him
,
"
who
is
not
here
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
who
it
is
---
Barnaby
,
who
brought
the
soldier
down
,
at
Westminster
.
 
<EOS>
Has
any
man
seen
or
heard
of
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
shook
their
heads
,
and
murmured
an
answer
in
the
negative
,
as
each
man
looked
round
and
appealed
to
his
fellow
;
when
a
noise
was
heard
without
,
and
a
man
was
heard
to
say
that
he
wanted
Hugh
---
that
he
must
see
Hugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
but
one
man
,
"
cried
Hugh
to
those
who
kept
the
door
;
"
let
him
come
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
!
"
muttered
the
others
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
him
come
in
.
 
<EOS>
Let
him
come
in
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
door
was
accordingly
unlocked
and
opened
.
 
<EOS>
A
one
-
armed
man
,
with
his
head
and
face
tied
up
with
a
bloody
cloth
,
as
though
he
had
been
severely
beaten
,
his
clothes
torn
,
and
his
remaining
hand
grasping
a
thick
stick
,
rushed
in
among
them
,
and
panting
for
breath
,
demanded
which
was
Hugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
he
is
,
"
replied
the
person
he
inquired
for
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
Hugh
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
want
with
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
message
for
you
,
"
said
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
one
Barnaby
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
of
him
?
 
<EOS>
Did
he
send
the
message
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
taken
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
in
one
of
the
strong
cells
in
Newgate
.
 
<EOS>
He
defended
himself
as
well
as
he
could
,
but
was
overpowered
by
numbers
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
his
message
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
did
you
see
him
?
"
asked
Hugh
,
hastily
.
  
<EOS>
"
On
his
way
to
prison
,
where
he
was
taken
by
a
party
of
soldiers
.
<EOS>
They
took
a
by
-
road
,
and
not
the
one
we
expected
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
one
of
the
few
who
tried
to
rescue
him
,
and
he
called
to
me
,
and
told
me
to
tell
Hugh
where
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
We
made
a
good
struggle
,
though
it
failed
.
 
<EOS>
Look
here
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
pointed
to
his
dress
and
to
his
bandaged
head
,
and
still
panting
for
breath
,
glanced
round
the
room
;
then
faced
towards
Hugh
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
by
sight
,
"
he
said
,
"
for
I
was
in
the
crowd
on
Friday
,
and
on
Saturday
,
and
yesterday
,
but
I
did
n't
know
your
name
.
<EOS>
You
're
a
bold
fellow
,
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
So
is
he
.
 
<EOS>
He
fought
like
a
lion
tonight
,
but
it
was
of
no
use
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
my
best
,
considering
that
I
want
this
limb
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Again
he
glanced
inquisitively
round
the
room
or
seemed
to
do
so
,
for
his
face
was
nearly
hidden
by
the
bandage
---
and
again
facing
sharply
towards
Hugh
,
grasped
his
stick
as
if
he
half
expected
to
be
set
upon
,
and
stood
on
the
defensive
.
  
<EOS>
If
he
had
any
such
apprehension
,
however
,
he
was
speedily
reassured
by
the
demeanour
of
all
present
.
 
<EOS>
None
thought
of
the
bearer
of
the
tidings
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
lost
in
the
news
he
brought
.
 
<EOS>
Oaths
,
threats
,
and
execrations
,
were
vented
on
all
sides
.
 
<EOS>
Some
cried
that
if
they
bore
this
tamely
,
another
day
would
see
them
all
in
jail
;
some
,
that
they
should
have
rescued
the
other
prisoners
,
and
this
would
not
have
happened
.
 
<EOS>
One
man
cried
in
a
loud
voice
,
"
Who
'll
follow
me
to
Newgate
!
"
<EOS>
and
there
was
a
loud
shout
and
general
rush
towards
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
But
Hugh
and
Dennis
stood
with
their
backs
against
it
,
and
kept
them
back
,
until
the
clamour
had
so
far
subsided
that
their
voices
could
be
heard
,
when
they
called
to
them
together
that
to
go
now
,
in
broad
day
,
would
be
madness
;
and
that
if
they
waited
until
night
and
arranged
a
plan
of
attack
,
they
might
release
,
not
only
their
own
companions
,
but
all
the
prisoners
,
and
burn
down
the
jail
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
that
jail
alone
,
"
cried
Hugh
,
"
but
every
jail
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
They
shall
have
no
place
to
put
their
prisoners
in
.
 
<EOS>
We
'll
burn
them
all
down
;
make
bonfires
of
them
every
one
!
 
<EOS>
Here
!
"
he
cried
,
catching
at
the
hangman
's
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
all
who
're
men
here
,
join
with
us
.
<EOS>
Shake
hands
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
Barnaby
out
of
jail
,
and
not
a
jail
left
standing
!
 
<EOS>
Who
joins
?
"
  
<EOS>
Every
man
there
.
 
<EOS>
And
they
swore
a
great
oath
to
release
their
friends
from
Newgate
next
night
;
to
force
the
doors
and
burn
the
jail
;
or
perish
in
the
fire
themselves
.

Chapter
61
    
<EOS>
On
that
same
night
---
events
so
crowd
upon
each
other
in
convulsed
and
distracted
times
,
that
more
than
the
stirring
incidents
of
a
whole
life
often
become
compressed
into
the
compass
of
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
---
on
that
same
night
,
Mr
Haredale
,
having
strongly
bound
his
prisoner
,
with
the
assistance
of
the
sexton
,
and
forced
him
to
mount
his
horse
,
conducted
him
to
Chigwell
;
bent
upon
procuring
a
conveyance
to
London
from
that
place
,
and
carrying
him
at
once
before
a
justice
.
 
<EOS>
The
disturbed
state
of
the
town
would
be
,
he
knew
,
a
sufficient
reason
for
demanding
the
murderer
's
committal
to
prison
before
daybreak
,
as
no
man
could
answer
for
the
security
of
any
of
the
watch
-
houses
or
ordinary
places
of
detention
;
and
to
convey
a
prisoner
through
the
streets
when
the
mob
were
again
abroad
,
would
not
only
be
a
task
of
great
danger
and
hazard
,
but
would
be
to
challenge
an
attempt
at
rescue
.
 
<EOS>
Directing
the
sexton
to
lead
the
horse
,
he
walked
close
by
the
murderer
's
side
,
and
in
this
order
they
reached
the
village
about
the
middle
of
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
The
people
were
all
awake
and
up
,
for
they
were
fearful
of
being
burnt
in
their
beds
,
and
sought
to
comfort
and
assure
each
other
by
watching
in
company
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
of
the
stoutest
-
hearted
were
armed
and
gathered
in
a
body
on
the
green
.
 
<EOS>
To
these
,
who
knew
him
well
,
Mr
Haredale
addressed
himself
,
briefly
narrating
what
had
happened
,
and
beseeching
them
to
aid
in
conveying
the
criminal
to
London
before
the
dawn
of
day
.
  
<EOS>
But
not
a
man
among
them
dared
to
help
him
by
so
much
as
the
motion
of
a
finger
.
 
<EOS>
The
rioters
,
in
their
passage
through
the
village
,
had
menaced
with
their
fiercest
vengeance
,
any
person
who
should
aid
in
extinguishing
the
fire
,
or
render
the
least
assistance
to
him
,
or
any
Catholic
whomsoever
.
 
<EOS>
Their
threats
extended
to
their
lives
and
all
they
possessed
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
assembled
for
their
own
protection
,
and
could
not
endanger
themselves
by
lending
any
aid
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
This
they
told
him
,
not
without
hesitation
and
regret
,
as
they
kept
aloof
in
the
moonlight
and
glanced
fearfully
at
the
ghostly
rider
,
who
,
with
his
head
drooping
on
his
breast
and
his
hat
slouched
down
upon
his
brow
,
neither
moved
nor
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
Finding
it
impossible
to
persuade
them
,
and
indeed
hardly
knowing
how
to
do
so
after
what
they
had
seen
of
the
fury
of
the
crowd
,
Mr
Haredale
besought
them
that
at
least
they
would
leave
him
free
to
act
for
himself
,
and
would
suffer
him
to
take
the
only
chaise
and
pair
of
horses
that
the
place
afforded
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
not
acceded
to
without
some
difficulty
,
but
in
the
end
they
told
him
to
do
what
he
would
,
and
go
away
from
them
in
heaven
's
name
.
  
<EOS>
Leaving
the
sexton
at
the
horse
's
bridle
,
he
drew
out
the
chaise
with
his
own
hands
,
and
would
have
harnessed
the
horses
,
but
that
the
post
-
boy
of
the
village
---
a
soft
-
hearted
,
good
-
for
-
nothing
,
vagabond
kind
of
fellow
---
was
moved
by
his
earnestness
and
passion
,
and
,
throwing
down
a
pitchfork
with
which
he
was
armed
,
swore
that
the
rioters
might
cut
him
into
mincemeat
if
they
liked
,
but
he
would
not
stand
by
and
see
an
honest
gentleman
who
had
done
no
wrong
,
reduced
to
such
extremity
,
without
doing
what
he
could
to
help
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
shook
him
warmly
by
the
hand
,
and
thanked
him
from
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
In
five
minutes
'
time
the
chaise
was
ready
,
and
this
good
scapegrace
in
his
saddle
.
 
<EOS>
The
murderer
was
put
inside
,
the
blinds
were
drawn
up
,
the
sexton
took
his
seat
upon
the
bar
,
Mr
Haredale
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
close
beside
the
door
;
and
so
they
started
in
the
dead
of
night
,
and
in
profound
silence
,
for
London
.
  
<EOS>
The
consternation
was
so
extreme
that
even
the
horses
which
had
escaped
the
flames
at
the
Warren
,
could
find
no
friends
to
shelter
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
passed
them
on
the
road
,
browsing
on
the
stunted
grass
;
and
the
driver
told
them
,
that
the
poor
beasts
had
wandered
to
the
village
first
,
but
had
been
driven
away
,
lest
they
should
bring
the
vengeance
of
the
crowd
on
any
of
the
inhabitants
.
  
<EOS>
Nor
was
this
feeling
confined
to
such
small
places
,
where
the
people
were
timid
,
ignorant
,
and
unprotected
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
came
near
London
they
met
,
in
the
grey
light
of
morning
,
more
than
one
poor
Catholic
family
who
,
terrified
by
the
threats
and
warnings
of
their
neighbours
,
were
quitting
the
city
on
foot
,
and
who
told
them
they
could
hire
no
cart
or
horse
for
the
removal
of
their
goods
,
and
had
been
compelled
to
leave
them
behind
,
at
the
mercy
of
the
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
Near
Mile
End
they
passed
a
house
,
the
master
of
which
<EOS>
,
a
Catholic
gentleman
of
small
means
,
having
hired
a
waggon
to
remove
his
furniture
by
midnight
,
had
had
it
all
brought
down
into
the
street
,
to
wait
the
vehicle
's
arrival
,
and
save
time
in
the
packing
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
man
with
whom
he
made
the
bargain
,
alarmed
by
the
fires
that
night
,
and
by
the
sight
of
the
rioters
passing
his
door
,
had
refused
to
keep
it
:
and
the
poor
gentleman
,
with
his
wife
and
servant
and
their
little
children
,
were
sitting
trembling
among
their
goods
in
the
open
street
,
dreading
the
arrival
of
day
and
not
knowing
where
to
turn
or
what
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
same
,
they
heard
,
with
the
public
conveyances
.
 
<EOS>
The
panic
was
so
great
that
the
mails
and
stage
-
coaches
were
afraid
to
carry
passengers
who
professed
the
obnoxious
religion
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
drivers
knew
them
,
or
they
admitted
that
they
held
that
creed
,
they
would
not
take
them
,
no
,
though
they
offered
large
sums
;
and
yesterday
,
people
had
been
afraid
to
recognise
Catholic
acquaintance
in
the
streets
,
lest
they
should
be
marked
by
spies
,
and
burnt
out
,
as
it
was
called
,
in
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
One
mild
old
man
---
 
a
priest
,
whose
chapel
was
destroyed
;
a
very
feeble
,
patient
,
inoffensive
creature
---
who
was
trudging
away
,
alone
,
designing
to
walk
some
distance
from
town
,
and
then
try
his
fortune
with
the
coaches
,
told
Mr
Haredale
that
he
feared
he
might
not
find
a
magistrate
who
would
have
the
hardihood
to
commit
a
prisoner
to
jail
,
on
his
complaint
.
 
<EOS>
But
notwithstanding
these
discouraging
accounts
they
went
on
,
and
reached
the
Mansion
House
soon
after
sunrise
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
threw
himself
from
his
horse
,
but
he
had
no
need
to
knock
at
the
door
,
for
it
was
already
open
,
and
there
stood
upon
the
step
a
portly
old
man
,
with
a
very
red
,
or
rather
purple
face
,
who
with
an
anxious
expression
of
countenance
,
was
remonstrating
with
some
unseen
personage
upstairs
,
while
the
porter
essayed
to
close
the
door
by
degrees
and
get
rid
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
With
the
intense
impatience
and
excitement
natural
to
one
in
his
condition
,
Mr
Haredale
thrust
himself
forward
and
was
about
to
speak
,
when
the
fat
old
gentleman
interposed
:
  
"
My
good
sir
,
"
said
he
,
"
pray
let
me
get
an
answer
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
sixth
time
I
have
been
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
here
five
times
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
My
house
is
threatened
with
destruction
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
to
be
burned
down
to
-
night
,
and
was
to
have
been
last
night
,
but
they
had
other
business
on
their
hands
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
let
me
get
an
answer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
good
sir
,
"
returned
Mr
Haredale
,
shaking
his
head
,
"
<EOS>
my
house
is
burned
to
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
But
heaven
forbid
that
yours
should
be
.
<EOS>
Get
your
answer
.
 
<EOS>
Be
brief
,
in
mercy
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
you
hear
this
,
my
lord
?
"
---
said
the
old
gentleman
,
calling
up
the
stairs
,
to
where
the
skirt
of
a
dressing
-
gown
fluttered
on
the
landing

Here
is
a
gentleman
here
,
whose
house
was
actually
burnt
down
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
dear
me
,
"
replied
a
testy
voice
,
"
I
am
very
sorry
for
it
,
but
what
am
I
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
build
it
up
again
.
 
<EOS>
The
chief
magistrate
of
the
city
ca
n't
go
and
be
a
rebuilding
of
people
's
houses
,
my
good
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Stuff
and
nonsense
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
the
chief
magistrate
of
the
city
can
prevent
people
's
houses
from
having
any
need
to
be
rebuilt
,
if
the
chief
magistrate
's
a
man
,
and
not
a
dummy
---
ca
n't
he
,
my
lord
?
"
cried
the
old
gentleman
in
a
choleric
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
disrespectable
,
sir
,
"
said
the
Lord
Mayor
---
"
leastways
,
disrespectful
I
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Disrespectful
,
my
lord
!
"
returned
the
old
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
respectful
five
times
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
be
respectful
for
ever

<EOS>
Men
ca
n't
stand
on
being
respectful
when
their
houses
are
going
to
be
burnt
over
their
heads
,
with
them
in
'em

<EOS>
What
am
I
to
do
,
my
lord
?
 
<EOS>
AM
I
to
have
any
protection
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
yesterday
,
sir
,
"
said
the
Lord
Mayor
,
"
that
you
might
have
an
alderman
in
your
house
,
if
you
could
get
one
to
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
the
devil
's
the
good
of
an
alderman
?
"
returned
the
choleric
old
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
"
---
To
awe
the
crowd
,
sir
,
"
said
the
Lord
Mayor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
Lord
ha
'
mercy
!
"
whimpered
the
old
gentleman
,
as
he
wiped
his
forehead
in
a
state
of
ludicrous
distress
,
"
to
think
of
sending
an
alderman
to
awe
a
crowd
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
my
lord
,
if
they
were
even
so
many
babies
,
fed
on
mother
's
milk
,
what
do
you
think
they
'd
care
for
an
alderman
!
 
<EOS>
Will
YOU
come
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
!
"
said
the
Lord
Mayor
,
most
emphatically
:
"
Certainly
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
what
,
"
returned
the
old
gentleman
,
"
what
am
I
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
Am
I
a
citizen
of
England
?
 
<EOS>
Am
I
to
have
the
benefit

the

Am
I

have
any
return
for
the
King
's
taxes

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
I
am
sure
,
"
said
the
Lord
Mayor
;
"
what
a
pity
it
is
you
're
a
Catholic
!
 
<EOS>
Why
could
n't
you
be
a
Protestant
,
and
then
you
would
n't
have
got
yourself
into
such
a
mess
?
 
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
I
do
n't
know
what
's
to
be
done

<EOS>

There
are
great
people
at

<EOS>
Oh
dear
me
,
what
a
thing
it
is
to
be
a
public
character

<EOS>

<EOS>
You
must
look
in
again
in
the
course
of
the
day

Would
a
javelin

man
do
?
<EOS>

<EOS>
Or
there
's
Philips
the
constable
,
---
<EOS>
HE
'S
disengaged
<EOS>

---
he
's
not
very
old
for
a
man
at
his
time
of
life
,
except
in
his
legs
,
and
if
you
put
him
up
at
a
window
he
'd
look
quite
young
by
candle
-
light
,
and
might
frighten
'em
very
much
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Oh
dear
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
well
!
---
we
'll
see
about
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Stop
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Haredale
,
pressing
the
door
open
as
the
porter
strove
to
shut
it
,
and
speaking
rapidly
<EOS>
,
"
My
Lord
Mayor
,
I
beg
you
not
to
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
man
here
,
who
committed
a
murder
eight
-
and
-
twenty
years
ago
.
 
<EOS>
Half
-
a
-
dozen
words
from
me
,
on
oath
,
will
justify
you
in
committing
him
to
prison
for
re
-
examination
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
seek
,
just
now
,
to
have
him
consigned
to
a
place
of
safety
.
 
<EOS>
The
least
delay
may
involve
his
being
rescued
by
the
rioters
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
me
!
"
cried
the
Lord
Mayor
.
 
<EOS>
"
God
bless
my
soul

and
body

<EOS>
oh
Lor
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
well
I

there
are
great
people
at
the

these
riots

you
know

<EOS>
---
You
really
must
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
"
<EOS>
the
murdered
gentleman
was
my
brother
;
I
succeeded
to
his
inheritance
;
there
were
not
wanting
slanderous
tongues
at
that
time
,
to
whisper
that
the
guilt
of
this
most
foul
and
cruel
deed
was
mine
---
mine
,
who
loved
him
,
as
he
knows
,
in
Heaven
,
dearly
.
 
<EOS>
The
time
has
come
,
after
all
these
years
of
gloom
and
misery
,
for
avenging
him
,
and
bringing
to
light
a
crime
so
artful
and
so
devilish
that
it
has
no
parallel
.
 
<EOS>
Every
second
's
delay
on
your
part
loosens
this
man
's
bloody
hands
again
,
and
leads
to
his
escape
.
 
<EOS>
My
lord
,
I
charge
you
hear
me
,
and
despatch
this
matter
on
the
instant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
me
!
"
cried
the
chief
magistrate
;
"
these
an't
business
hours
,
you
know
---
I
wonder
at
you
---
how
ungentlemanly
it
is
of
you
---
 
<EOS>
you
must
n't
---
you
really
must
n't
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
And
I
suppose
you
are
a
Catholic
too
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
my
soul
<EOS>
,
I
believe
people
turn
Catholics
a'purpose
to
vex
and
worrit
me
,
"
cried
the
Lord
Mayor
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
would
n't
come
here
;
they
'll
be
setting
the
Mansion
House
afire
next
,
and
we
shall
have
you
to
thank
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
lock
your
prisoner
up
,
sir
---
give
him
to
a
watchman
---
and
---
call
again
at
a
proper
time
.
<EOS>
Then
we
'll
see
about
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
Before
Mr
Haredale
could
answer
,
the
sharp
closing
of
a
door
and
drawing
of
its
bolts
,
gave
notice
that
the
Lord
Mayor
had
retreated
to
his
bedroom
,
and
that
further
remonstrance
would
be
unavailing
.
<EOS>
The
two
clients
retreated
likewise
,
and
the
porter
shut
them
out
into
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
way
he
puts
me
off
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
"
I
can
get
no
redress
and
no
help
.
 
<EOS>
What
are
you
going
to
do
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
try
elsewhere
,
"
answered
Mr
Haredale
,
who
was
by
this
time
on
horseback
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
for
you
,
I
assure
you
---
<EOS>
and
well
I
may
,
for
we
are
in
a
common
cause
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
may
not
have
a
house
to
offer
you
to
-
night
;
let
me
tender
it
while
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
On
second
thoughts
though
,
"
he
added
,
putting
up
a
pocket
-
book
he
had
produced
while
speaking
,
"
I
'll
not
give
you
a
card
,
for
if
it
was
found
upon
you
,
it
might
get
you
into
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
Langdale
<EOS>
---
that
's
my
name
---
vintner
and
distiller
---
Holborn
Hill
<EOS>
---
you
're
heartily
welcome
,
if
you
'll
come
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
bowed
,
and
rode
off
,
close
beside
the
chaise
as
before
;
determining
to
repair
to
the
house
of
Sir
John
Fielding
,
who
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
bold
and
active
magistrate
,
and
fully
resolved
,
<EOS>
in
case
the
rioters
should
come
upon
them
,
to
do
execution
on
the
murderer
with
his
own
hands
,
rather
than
suffer
him
to
be
released
.
  
<EOS>
They
arrived
at
the
magistrate
's
dwelling
,
however
,
without
molestation
(
for
the
mob
,
as
we
have
seen
,
were
then
intent
on
deeper
schemes
)
,
and
knocked
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
had
been
pretty
generally
rumoured
that
Sir
John
was
proscribed
by
the
rioters
,
a
body
of
thief
-
takers
had
been
keeping
watch
in
the
house
all
night
.
<EOS>
To
one
of
them
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
stated
his
business
,
which
appearing
to
the
man
of
sufficient
moment
to
warrant
his
arousing
the
justice
,
procured
him
an
immediate
audience
.
  
<EOS>
No
time
was
lost
in
committing
the
murderer
to
Newgate
;
then
a
new
building
,
recently
completed
at
a
vast
expense
,
and
considered
to
be
of
enormous
strength
.
 
<EOS>
The
warrant
being
made
out
,
three
of
the
thief
-
takers
bound
him
afresh
(
he
had
been
struggling
,
it
seemed
,
in
the
chaise
,
and
had
loosened
his
manacles
)
;
gagged
him
lest
they
should
meet
with
any
of
the
mob
,
and
he
should
call
to
them
for
help
;
and
seated
themselves
,
along
with
him
,
in
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
These
men
being
all
well
armed
,
made
a
formidable
escort
;
but
they
drew
up
the
blinds
again
,
as
though
the
carriage
were
empty
,
and
directed
Mr
Haredale
to
ride
forward
,
that
he
might
not
attract
attention
by
seeming
to
belong
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
wisdom
of
this
proceeding
was
sufficiently
obvious
,
for
as
they
hurried
through
the
city
they
passed
among
several
groups
of
men
,
who
,
if
they
had
not
supposed
the
chaise
to
be
quite
empty
,
would
certainly
have
stopped
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
those
within
keeping
quite
close
,
and
the
driver
tarrying
to
be
asked
no
questions
,
they
reached
the
prison
without
interruption
,
and
,
once
there
,
had
him
out
,
and
safe
within
its
gloomy
walls
,
in
a
twinkling
.
  
<EOS>
With
eager
eyes
and
strained
attention
,
Mr
Haredale
saw
him
chained
,
and
locked
and
barred
up
in
his
cell
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
when
he
had
left
the
jail
,
and
stood
in
the
free
street
,
without
,
he
felt
the
iron
plates
upon
the
doors
,
with
his
hands
,
and
drew
them
over
the
stone
wall
,
to
assure
himself
that
it
was
real
;
and
to
exult
in
its
being
so
strong
,
and
rough
,
and
cold
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
until
he
turned
his
back
upon
the
jail
,
and
glanced
along
the
empty
streets
,
so
lifeless
and
quiet
in
the
bright
morning
,
that
he
felt
the
weight
upon
his
heart
;
that
he
knew
he
was
tortured
by
anxiety
for
those
he
had
left
at
home
;
and
that
home
itself
was
but
another
bead
in
the
long
rosary
of
his
regrets
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
62
    
<EOS>
The
prisoner
,
left
to
himself
,
sat
down
upon
his
bedstead
:
and
resting
his
elbows
on
his
knees
,
and
his
chin
upon
his
hands
,
remained
in
that
attitude
for
hours
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
hard
to
say
,
of
what
nature
his
reflections
were
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
no
distinctness
,
and
,
saving
for
some
flashes
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
no
reference
to
his
condition
or
the
train
of
circumstances
by
which
it
had
been
brought
about
.
<EOS>
The
cracks
in
the
pavement
of
his
cell
,
the
chinks
in
the
wall
where
stone
was
joined
to
stone
,
the
bars
in
the
window
,
the
iron
ring
upon
the
floor
,
---
such
things
as
these
,
subsiding
strangely
into
one
another
,
and
awakening
an
indescribable
kind
of
interest
and
amusement
,
engrossed
his
whole
mind
;
and
although
at
the
bottom
of
his
every
thought
there
was
an
uneasy
sense
of
guilt
,
and
dread
of
death
,
he
felt
no
more
than
that
vague
consciousness
of
it
,
which
a
sleeper
has
of
pain
.
 
<EOS>
It
pursues
him
through
his
dreams
,
gnaws
at
the
heart
of
all
his
fancied
pleasures
,
robs
the
banquet
of
its
taste
,
music
of
its
sweetness
,
makes
happiness
itself
unhappy
,
and
yet
is
no
bodily
sensation
,
but
a
phantom
without
shape
,
or
form
,
or
visible
presence
;
pervading
everything
,
but
having
no
existence
;
recognisable
everywhere
,
but
nowhere
seen
,
or
touched
,
or
met
with
face
to
face
,
until
the
sleep
is
past
,
and
waking
agony
returns
.
  
<EOS>
After
a
long
time
the
door
of
his
cell
opened
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
up
;
saw
the
blind
man
enter
;
and
relapsed
into
his
former
position
.
  
<EOS>
Guided
by
his
breathing
,
the
visitor
advanced
to
where
he
sat
;
and
stopping
beside
him
,
and
stretching
out
his
hand
to
assure
himself
that
he
was
right
,
remained
,
for
a
good
space
,
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
bad
,
Rudge
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
bad
,
"
he
said
at
length
.
  
<EOS>
The
prisoner
shuffled
with
his
feet
upon
the
ground
in
turning
his
body
from
him
,
but
made
no
other
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
were
you
taken
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
where
?
 
<EOS>
You
never
told
me
more
than
half
your
secret
.
 
<EOS>
No
matter
;
I
know
it
now
.
 
<EOS>
How
was
it
,
and
where
,
eh
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
again
,
coming
still
nearer
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
At
Chigwell
,
"
said
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
At
Chigwell
!
 
<EOS>
How
came
you
there
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
went
there
to
avoid
the
man
I
stumbled
on
,
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
Because
I
was
chased
and
driven
there
,
by
him
and
Fate
.
 
<EOS>
Because
I
was
urged
to
go
there
,
by
something
stronger
than
my
own
will
.
<EOS>
When
I
found
him
watching
in
the
house
she
used
to
live
in
,
night
after
night
,
I
knew
I
never
could
escape
him
---
never
!
<EOS>
and
when
I
heard
the
Bell
---
"
  
He
shivered
;
muttered
that
it
was
very
cold
;
paced
quickly
up
and
down
the
narrow
cell
;
and
sitting
down
again
,
fell
into
his
old
posture
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
were
saying
,
"
said
the
blind
man
,
after
another
pause
,
"
that
when
you
heard
the
Bell
---
"
  
"
Let
it
be
,
will
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
retorted
in
a
hurried
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
hangs
there
yet
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
blind
man
turned
a
wistful
and
inquisitive
face
towards
him
,
but
he
continued
to
speak
,
without
noticing
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
went
to
Chigwell
,
in
search
of
the
mob
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
so
hunted
and
beset
by
this
man
<EOS>
,
that
I
knew
my
only
hope
of
safety
lay
in
joining
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
gone
on
before
;
I
followed
them
when
it
left
off
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
what
left
off
?
"
  
"
The
Bell
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
quitted
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
I
hoped
that
some
of
them
might
be
still
lingering
among
the
ruins
,
and
was
searching
for
them
when
I
heard
---
"
he
drew
a
long
breath
,
and
wiped
his
forehead
with
his
sleeve
---
"
his
voice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Saying
what
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
matter
what
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
then
at
the
foot
of
the
turret
,
where
I
did
the
---
"
  
"
Ay
,
"
said
the
blind
man
,
nodding
his
head
with
perfect
composure
,
"
I
understand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
climbed
the
stair
,
or
so
much
of
it
as
was
left
;
<EOS>
meaning
to
hide
till
he
had
gone
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
heard
me
;
and
followed
almost
as
soon
as
I
set
foot
upon
the
ashes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
might
have
hidden
in
the
wall
,
and
thrown
him
down
,
or
stabbed
him
,
"
said
the
blind
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
Might
I
?
 
<EOS>
Between
that
man
and
me
,
was
one
who
led
him
on
---
<EOS>
I
saw
it
,
though
he
did
not
---
and
raised
above
his
head
a
bloody
hand
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
in
the
room
above
that
HE
<EOS>
and
I
stood
glaring
at
each
other
on
the
night
of
the
murder
,
and
before
he
fell
he
raised
his
hand
like
that
,
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
the
chase
would
end
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
strong
fancy
,
"
said
the
blind
man
,
with
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
Strengthen
yours
with
blood
,
and
see
what
it
will
come
to
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
groaned
,
and
rocked
himself
,
and
looking
up
for
the
first
time
,
said
,
in
a
low
,
hollow
voice
:
  
"
Eight
-
and
-
twenty
years
!
 
<EOS>
Eight
-
and
-
twenty
years
!
 
<EOS>
He
has
never
changed
in
all
that
time
,
never
grown
older
,
nor
altered
in
the
least
degree
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
been
before
me
in
the
dark
night
,
and
the
broad
sunny
day
;
in
the
twilight
,
the
moonlight
,
the
sunlight
,
the
light
of
fire
,
and
lamp
,
and
candle
;
and
in
the
deepest
gloom
.
<EOS>
Always
the
same
!
 
<EOS>
In
company
,
in
solitude
,
on
land
,
on
shipboard
;
sometimes
leaving
me
alone
for
months
,
and
sometimes
always
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
seen
him
,
at
sea
,
come
gliding
in
the
dead
of
night
along
the
bright
reflection
of
the
moon
in
the
calm
water
;
and
I
have
seen
him
,
on
quays
and
market
-
places
,
with
his
hand
uplifted
,
towering
,
the
centre
of
a
busy
crowd
,
unconscious
of
the
terrible
form
that
had
its
silent
stand
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
Fancy
!
 
<EOS>
Are
you
real
?
<EOS>
Am
I
?
 
<EOS>
Are
these
iron
fetters
,
riveted
on
me
by
the
smith
's
hammer
,
or
are
they
fancies
I
can
shatter
at
a
blow
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
blind
man
listened
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Fancy
!
 
<EOS>
Do
I
fancy
that
I
killed
him
?
 
<EOS>
Do
I
fancy
that
as
I
left
the
chamber
where
he
lay
,
I
saw
the
face
of
a
man
peeping
from
a
dark
door
,
who
plainly
showed
me
by
his
fearful
looks
that
he
suspected
what
I
had
done
?
 
<EOS>
Do
I
remember
that
I
spoke
fairly
to
him
---
that
I
drew
nearer
---
nearer
yet
---
with
the
hot
knife
in
my
sleeve
?
 
<EOS>
Do
I
fancy
how
HE
died
?
 
<EOS>
Did
he
stagger
back
into
the
angle
of
the
wall
into
which
I
had
hemmed
him
,
and
,
bleeding
inwardly
,
stand
,
not
fail
,
a
corpse
before
me
?
 
<EOS>
Did
I
see
him
,
for
an
instant
,
as
I
see
you
now
,
erect
and
on
his
feet
---
but
dead
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
blind
man
,
who
knew
that
he
had
risen
,
motioned
him
to
sit
down
again
upon
his
bedstead
;
but
he
took
no
notice
of
the
gesture
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
then
I
thought
,
for
the
first
time
,
of
fastening
the
murder
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
then
I
dressed
him
in
my
clothes
,
and
dragged
him
down
the
back
-
stairs
to
the
piece
of
water
.
 
<EOS>
Do
I
remember
listening
to
the
bubbles
that
came
rising
up
when
I
had
rolled
him
in
?
 
<EOS>
Do
I
remember
wiping
the
water
from
my
face
,
and
because
the
body
splashed
it
there
,
in
its
descent
,
feeling
as
if
it
MUST
be
blood
?
  
<EOS>
"
Did
I
go
home
when
I
had
done
?
 
<EOS>
And
oh
,
my
God
!
<EOS>
how
long
it
took
to
do
!
 
<EOS>
Did
I
stand
before
my
wife
,
and
tell
her
?
 
<EOS>
Did
I
see
her
fall
upon
the
ground
;
and
,
when
I
stooped
to
raise
her
,
did
she
thrust
me
back
with
a
force
that
cast
me
off
as
if
I
had
been
a
child
,
staining
the
hand
with
which
she
clasped
my
wrist
?
 
<EOS>
Is
THAT
fancy
?
  
<EOS>
"
Did
she
go
down
upon
her
knees
,
and
call
on
Heaven
to
witness
that
she
and
her
unborn
child
renounced
me
from
that
hour
;
and
did
she
,
in
words
so
solemn
that
they
turned
me
cold
---
me
,
fresh
from
the
horrors
my
own
hands
had
made
---
warn
me
to
fly
while
there
was
time
;
for
though
she
would
be
silent
,
being
my
wretched
wife
,
she
would
not
shelter
me
?
 
<EOS>
Did
I
go
forth
that
night
,
abjured
of
God
and
man
,
and
anchored
deep
in
hell
,
to
wander
at
my
cable
's
length
about
the
earth
,
and
surely
be
drawn
down
at
last
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
did
you
return
?
 
<EOS>
said
the
blind
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
is
blood
red
?
 
<EOS>
I
could
no
more
help
it
,
than
I
could
live
without
breath
.
 
<EOS>
I
struggled
against
the
impulse
,
but
I
was
drawn
back
,
through
every
difficult
and
adverse
circumstance
,
as
by
a
mighty
engine
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
could
stop
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
day
and
hour
were
none
of
my
choice
.
 
<EOS>
Sleeping
and
waking
<EOS>
,
I
had
been
among
the
old
haunts
for
years
---
had
visited
my
own
grave
.
 
<EOS>
Why
did
I
come
back
?
 
<EOS>
Because
this
jail
was
gaping
for
me
,
and
he
stood
beckoning
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
were
not
known
?
"
said
the
blind
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
a
man
who
had
been
twenty
-
two
years
dead
.
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
not
known

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
have
kept
your
secret
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
MY
secret
?
 
<EOS>
MINE
?
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
secret
,
any
breath
of
air
could
whisper
at
its
will
.
 
<EOS>
The
stars
had
it
in
their
twinkling
,
the
water
in
its
flowing
,
the
leaves
in
their
rustling
,
the
seasons
in
their
return
.
 
<EOS>
It
lurked
in
strangers
'
faces
,
and
their
voices
.
<EOS>
Everything
had
lips
on
which
it
always
trembled
.
<EOS>
---
MY
secret
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
revealed
by
your
own
act
at
any
rate
,
"
said
the
blind
man
.
  
<EOS>

The
act
was
not
mine
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
it
,
but
it
was
not
mine
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
forced
at
times
to
wander
round
,
and
round
,
and
round
that
spot
.
<EOS>
If
you
had
chained
me
up
when
the
fit
was
on
me
,
I
should
have
broken
away
,
and
gone
there
.
 
<EOS>
As
truly
as
the
loadstone
draws
iron
towards
it
,
so
he
,
lying
at
the
bottom
of
his
grave
,
could
draw
me
near
him
when
he
would
.
 
<EOS>
Was
that
fancy
?
 
<EOS>
Did
I
like
to
go
there
,
or
did
I
strive
and
wrestle
with
the
power
that
forced
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
blind
man
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
and
smiled
incredulously
.
<EOS>
The
prisoner
again
resumed
his
old
attitude
,
and
for
a
long
time
both
were
mute
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
then
,
"
said
his
visitor
,
at
length
breaking
silence
,
"
that
you
are
penitent
and
resigned
;
that
you
desire
to
make
peace
with
everybody
(
in
particular
,
with
your
wife
who
has
brought
you
to
this
)
;
and
that
you
ask
no
greater
favour
than
to
be
carried
to
Tyburn
as
soon
as
possible
?
 
<EOS>
That
being
the
case
,
I
had
better
take
my
leave
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
good
enough
to
be
company
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
I
not
told
you
,
"
said
the
other
fiercely
,
"
that
I
have
striven
and
wrestled
with
the
power
that
brought
me
here
?
 
<EOS>
Has
my
whole
life
,
for
eight
-
and
-
twenty
years
,
been
one
perpetual
struggle
and
resistance
,
and
do
you
think
I
want
to
lie
down
and
die
?
 
<EOS>
Do
all
men
shrink
from
death

<EOS>
I
most
of
all
!

<EOS>
That
's
better
said

<EOS>
That
's
better
spoken

Rudge
---
<EOS>
but
I
'll
not
call
you
that
again

than
anything
you
have
said
yet

returned
the
blind
man
,
speaking
more
familiarly
,
and
laying
his
hands
upon
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lookye
,
---
I
never
killed
a
man
myself
,
for
I
have
never
been
placed
in
a
position
that
made
it
worth
my
while
.
 
<EOS>
Farther
,
I
am
not
an
advocate
for
killing
men
,
and
I
do
n't
think
I
should
recommend
it
<EOS>
or
like
it

for
it
's
very
hazardous

under
any
circumstances

<EOS>
But
as
you
had
the
misfortune
to
get
into
this
trouble
before
I
made
your
acquaintance
,
and
as
you
have
been
my
companion
,
and
have
been
of
use
to
me
for
a
long
time
now
,
I
overlook
that
part
of
the
matter
,
and
am
only
anxious
that
you
should
n't
die
unnecessarily

Now
,
I
do
not
consider
that

at
present
,
it
is
at
all
necessary

<EOS>
"
What
else
is
left
me
?

returned
the
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
eat
my
way
through
these
walls
with
my
teeth
?
"
  
"
Something
easier
than
that
,

returned
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
Promise
me
that
you
will
talk
no
more
of
these
fancies
of
yours

idle
,
foolish
things

quite
beneath
a
man

and
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
mean

"
Tell
me
,

said
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
worthy
lady
with
the
tender
conscience

your
scrupulous

virtuous

punctilious

not
blindly
affectionate
wife

What
of
her
?

<EOS>
"
Is
now
in
London

A
curse

she
where
she
may
!

That
's
natural
enough
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
had
taken
her
annuity
as
usual

you
would
not
have
been
here

we
should
have
been
better
off

But
that
's
apart
from
the
business

<EOS>
She
's
in
London

<EOS>
Scared
,
as
I
suppose
,
and
have
no
doubt
,
by
my
representation
when
I
waited
upon
her
,
that
you
were
close
at
hand
(
which
I
,
of
course
,
urged
only
as
an
inducement
to
compliance
,
knowing
that
she
was
not
pining
to
see
you
)
<EOS>
,
she
left
that
place
,
and
travelled
up
to
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
know
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
From
my
friend
the
noble
captain
---
the
illustrious
general
---
the
bladder
,
Mr
Tappertit
.
 
<EOS>
I
learnt
from
him
the
last
time
I
saw
him
,
which
was
yesterday
,
that
your
son
who
is
called
Barnaby
---
not
after
his
father
,
I
suppose
---
"
  
"
Death
!
<EOS>
does
that
matter
now
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
---
You
are
impatient
,
"
said
the
blind
man
,
calmly
;
"
it
's
a
good
sign
,
and
looks
like
life
---
that
your
son
Barnaby
had
been
lured
away
from
her
by
one
of
his
companions
who
knew
him
of
old
,
at
Chigwell
;
and
that
he
is
now
among
the
rioters
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
is
that
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
If
father
and
son
be
hanged
together
,
what
comfort
shall
I
find
in
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Stay
---
stay
,
my
friend
,
"
returned
the
blind
man
,
with
a
cunning
look
,
"
you
travel
fast
to
journeys
'
ends
.
 
<EOS>
Suppose
I
track
my
lady
out
,
and
say
thus
much
:
"
<EOS>
You
want
your
son
,
ma'am

good

<EOS>
I
,
knowing
those
who
tempt
him
to
remain
among
them
,
can
restore
him
to
you
,
ma'am

good

<EOS>
You
must
pay
a
price
,
ma'am
,
for
his
restoration
---
good
again

<EOS>
The
price
is
small
,
and
easy
to
be
paid
---
 
<EOS>
dear
ma'am
,
that
's
best
of
all
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
mockery
is
this
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
likely
,
she
may
reply
in
those
words
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
mockery
at
all
,
"
I
answer
:
"
Madam
,
a
person
said
to
be
your
husband
(
identity
is
difficult
of
proof
after
the
lapse
of
many
years
)
is
in
prison
,
his
life
in
peril
---
the
charge
against
him
,
murder
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
ma'am
,
your
husband
has
been
dead
a
long
,
long
time
.
 
<EOS>
The
gentleman
never
can
be
confounded
with
him
,
if
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
say
a
few
words
,
on
oath
,
as
to
when
he
died
,
and
how
;
and
that
this
person
(
who
I
am
told
resembles
him
in
some
degree
)
is
no
more
he
than
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
Such
testimony
will
set
the
question
quite
at
rest
.
 
<EOS>
Pledge
yourself
to
me
to
give
it
,
ma
"
am
,
and
I
will
undertake
to
keep
your
son
(
a
fine
lad
)
out
of
harm
's
way
until
you
have
done
this
trifling
service
,
when
he
shall
he
delivered
up
to
you
,
safe
and
sound
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
if
you
decline
to
do
so
,
I
fear
he
will
be
betrayed
,
and
handed
over
to
the
law
,
which
will
assuredly
sentence
him
to
suffer
death
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
,
in
fact
,
a
choice
between
his
life
and
death
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
refuse
,
he
swings
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
comply
,
the
timber
is
not
grown
,
nor
the
hemp
sown
,
that
shall
do
him
any
harm
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
There
is
a
gleam
of
hope
in
this
!
"
cried
the
prisoner
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
gleam
!
"
returned
his
friend
,
"
a
noon
-
blaze
;
a
full
and
glorious
daylight
.
 
<EOS>
Hush
!
<EOS>
I
hear
the
tread
of
distant
feet
.
 
<EOS>
Rely
on
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
shall
I
hear
more
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
soon
as
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
hope
,
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
coming
to
say
that
our
time
for
talk
is
over
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
the
jingling
of
the
keys
.
 
<EOS>
Not
another
word
of
this
just
now
,
or
they
may
overhear
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
he
said
these
words
,
the
lock
was
turned
,
and
one
of
the
prison
turnkeys
appearing
at
the
door
,
announced
that
it
was
time
for
visitors
to
leave
the
jail
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
soon
!
"
said
Stagg
,
meekly
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
it
ca
n't
be
helped
.
 
<EOS>
Cheer
up
,
friend
.
 
<EOS>
This
mistake
will
soon
be
set
at
rest
,
and
then
you
are
a
man
again
!
 
<EOS>
If
this
charitable
gentleman
will
lead
a
blind
man
(
who
has
nothing
in
return
but
prayers
)
to
the
prison
-
porch
,
and
set
him
with
his
face
towards
the
west
,
he
will
do
a
worthy
deed
.
 
<EOS>
Thank
you
,
good
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
thank
you
very
kindly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
saying
,
and
pausing
for
an
instant
at
the
door
to
turn
his
grinning
face
towards
his
friend
,
he
departed
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
officer
had
seen
him
to
the
porch
,
he
returned
,
and
again
unlocking
and
unbarring
the
door
of
the
cell
,
set
it
wide
open
,
informing
its
inmate
that
he
was
at
liberty
to
walk
in
the
adjacent
yard
,
if
he
thought
proper
,
for
an
hour
.
  
<EOS>
The
prisoner
answered
with
a
sullen
nod
;
and
being
left
alone
again
,
sat
brooding
over
what
he
had
heard
,
and
pondering
upon
the
hopes
the
recent
conversation
had
awakened
;
gazing
abstractedly
,
the
while
he
did
so
,
on
the
light
without
,
and
watching
the
shadows
thrown
by
one
wall
on
another
,
and
on
the
stone
-
paved
ground
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
dull
,
square
yard
,
made
cold
and
gloomy
by
high
walls
,
and
seeming
to
chill
the
very
sunlight
.
 
<EOS>
The
stone
,
so
bare
,
and
rough
,
and
obdurate
,
filled
even
him
with
longing
thoughts
of
meadow
-
land
and
trees
;
and
with
a
burning
wish
to
be
at
liberty
.
<EOS>
As
he
looked
,
he
rose
,
and
leaning
against
the
door
-
post
,
gazed
up
at
the
bright
blue
sky
,
smiling
even
on
that
dreary
home
of
crime
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
,
for
a
moment
,
to
remember
lying
on
his
back
in
some
sweet
-
scented
place
,
and
gazing
at
it
through
moving
branches
,
long
ago
.
  
<EOS>
His
attention
was
suddenly
attracted
by
a
clanking
sound
---
he
knew
what
it
was
,
for
he
had
startled
himself
by
making
the
same
noise
in
walking
to
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
a
voice
began
to
sing
,
and
he
saw
the
shadow
of
a
figure
on
the
pavement
.
 
<EOS>
It
stopped
---
was
silent
all
at
once
,
as
though
the
person
for
a
moment
had
forgotten
where
he
was
,
but
soon
remembered
---
and
<EOS>
so
,
with
the
same
clanking
noise
,
the
shadow
disappeared
.
  
<EOS>
He
walked
out
into
the
court
and
paced
it
to
and
fro
;
startling
the
echoes
,
as
he
went
,
with
the
harsh
jangling
of
his
fetters
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
door
near
his
,
which
,
like
his
,
stood
ajar
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
not
taken
half
-
a
-
dozen
turns
up
and
down
the
yard
,
when
,
standing
still
to
observe
this
door
,
he
heard
the
clanking
sound
again
.
 
<EOS>
A
face
looked
out
of
the
grated
window
---
he
saw
it
very
dimly
,
for
the
cell
was
dark
and
the
bars
were
heavy
---
and
directly
afterwards
,
a
man
appeared
,
and
came
towards
him
.
  
<EOS>
For
the
sense
of
loneliness
he
had
,
he
might
have
been
in
jail
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
Made
eager
by
the
hope
of
companionship
,
he
quickened
his
pace
,
and
hastened
to
meet
the
man
half
way
---
   
<EOS>
What
was
this
!
 
<EOS>
His
son
!
  
<EOS>
They
stood
face
to
face
,
staring
at
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
He
shrinking
and
cowed
,
despite
himself
;
<EOS>
Barnahy
struggling
with
his
imperfect
memory
,
and
wondering
where
he
had
seen
that
face
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
uncertain
long
,
for
suddenly
he
laid
hands
upon
him
,
and
striving
to
bear
him
to
the
ground
,
cried
:
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
know
!
 
<EOS>
You
are
the
robber
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
said
nothing
in
reply
at
first
,
but
held
down
his
head
,
and
struggled
with
him
silently
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
the
younger
man
too
strong
for
him
,
he
raised
his
face
,
looked
close
into
his
eyes
,
and
said
,
  
"
I
am
your
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
God
knows
what
magic
the
name
had
for
his
ears
;
but
Barnaby
released
his
hold
,
fell
back
,
and
looked
at
him
aghast
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
he
sprung
towards
him
,
put
his
arms
about
his
neck
,
and
pressed
his
head
against
his
cheek
.
  
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
he
was
;
he
was
sure
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
But
where
had
he
been
so
long
,
and
why
had
he
left
his
mother
by
herself
,
or
worse
than
by
herself
,
with
her
poor
foolish
boy
?
 
<EOS>
And
had
she
really
been
as
happy
as
they
said
?
 
<EOS>
And
where
was
she
?
 
<EOS>
Was
she
near
there
?
 
<EOS>
She
was
not
happy
now
,
and
he
in
jail
?
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
no
.
  
<EOS>
Not
a
word
was
said
in
answer
;
but
Grip
croaked
loudly
,
and
hopped
about
them
,
round
and
round
,
as
if
enclosing
them
in
a
magic
circle
,
and
invoking
all
the
powers
of
mischief
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
63
    
During
the
whole
of
this
day
,
every
regiment
in
or
near
the
metropolis
was
on
duty
in
one
or
other
part
of
the
town
;
and
the
regulars
and
militia
,
in
obedience
to
the
orders
which
were
sent
to
every
barrack
and
station
within
twenty
-
four
hours
'
journey
,
began
to
pour
in
by
all
the
roads
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
disturbance
had
attained
to
such
a
formidable
height
,
and
the
rioters
had
grown
,
with
impunity
,
to
be
so
audacious
,
that
the
sight
of
this
great
force
,
continually
augmented
by
new
arrivals
,
instead
of
operating
as
a
check
,
stimulated
them
to
outrages
of
greater
hardihood
than
any
they
had
yet
committed
;
and
helped
to
kindle
a
flame
in
London
,
the
like
of
which
had
never
been
beheld
,
even
in
its
ancient
and
rebellious
times
.
  
<EOS>
All
yesterday
,
and
on
this
day
likewise
,
the
commander
-
in
-
chief
endeavoured
to
arouse
the
magistrates
to
a
sense
of
their
duty
,
and
in
particular
the
Lord
Mayor
,
who
was
the
faintest
-
hearted
and
most
timid
of
them
all
.
 
<EOS>
With
this
object
,
large
bodies
of
the
soldiery
were
several
times
despatched
to
the
Mansion
House
to
await
his
orders
:
<EOS>
but
as
he
could
,
by
no
threats
or
persuasions
,
be
induced
to
give
any
,
and
as
the
men
remained
in
the
open
street
,
fruitlessly
for
any
good
purpose
,
and
thrivingly
for
a
very
bad
one
;
these
laudable
attempts
did
harm
rather
than
good
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
crowd
,
becoming
speedily
acquainted
with
the
Lord
Mayor
's
temper
,
did
not
fail
to
take
advantage
of
it
by
boasting
that
even
the
civil
authorities
were
opposed
to
the
Papists
,
and
could
not
find
it
in
their
hearts
to
molest
those
who
were
guilty
of
no
other
offence
.
 
<EOS>
These
vaunts
they
took
care
to
make
within
the
hearing
of
the
soldiers
;
and
<EOS>
they
,
being
naturally
loth
to
quarrel
with
the
people
,
received
their
advances
kindly
enough
:
answering
,
when
they
were
asked
if
they
desired
to
fire
upon
their
countrymen
,
"
No
,
they
would
be
damned
if
they
did
;
"
and
showing
much
honest
simplicity
and
good
nature
.
 
<EOS>
The
feeling
that
the
military
were
No
-
Popery
men
,
and
were
ripe
for
disobeying
orders
and
joining
the
mob
,
soon
became
very
prevalent
in
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
Rumours
of
their
disaffection
,
and
of
their
leaning
towards
the
popular
cause
,
spread
from
mouth
to
mouth
with
astonishing
rapidity
;
and
whenever
they
were
drawn
up
idly
in
the
streets
or
squares
,
there
was
sure
to
be
a
crowd
about
them
,
cheering
and
shaking
hands
,
and
treating
them
with
a
great
show
of
confidence
and
affection
.
  
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
the
crowd
was
everywhere
;
all
concealment
and
disguise
were
laid
aside
,
and
they
pervaded
the
whole
town
.
 
<EOS>
If
any
man
among
them
wanted
money
,
he
had
but
to
knock
at
the
door
of
a
dwelling
-
house
,
or
walk
into
a
shop
,
and
demand
it
in
the
rioters
name
;
and
his
demand
was
instantly
complied
with
.
 
<EOS>
The
peaceable
citizens
being
afraid
to
lay
hands
upon
them
,
singly
and
alone
,
it
may
be
easily
supposed
that
when
gathered
together
in
bodies
,
they
were
perfectly
secure
from
interruption
.
 
<EOS>
They
assembled
in
the
streets
,
traversed
them
at
their
will
and
pleasure
,
and
publicly
concerted
their
plans
.
 
<EOS>
Business
was
quite
suspended
;
the
greater
part
of
the
shops
were
closed
;
most
of
the
houses
displayed
a
blue
flag
in
token
of
their
adherence
to
the
popular
side
;
and
even
the
Jews
in
Houndsditch
,
Whitechapel
,
and
those
quarters
,
wrote
upon
their
doors
or
window
-
shutters
,
"
This
House
is
a
True
Protestant
.
<EOS>
"
The
crowd
was
the
law
,
and
never
was
the
law
held
in
greater
dread
,
or
more
implicitly
obeyed
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
about
six
o'clock
in
the
evening
,
when
a
vast
mob
poured
into
Lincoln
's
Inn
Fields
by
every
avenue
,
and
divided
---
evidently
in
pursuance
of
a
previous
design
---
into
several
parties
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
understood
that
this
arrangement
was
known
to
the
whole
crowd
,
but
that
it
was
the
work
of
a
few
leaders
;
who
,
mingling
with
the
men
as
they
came
upon
the
ground
,
and
calling
to
them
to
fall
into
this
or
that
parry
,
effected
it
as
rapidly
as
if
it
had
been
determined
on
by
a
council
of
the
whole
number
,
and
every
man
had
known
his
place
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
perfectly
notorious
to
the
assemblage
that
the
largest
body
,
which
comprehended
about
two
-
thirds
of
the
whole
,
was
designed
for
the
attack
on
Newgate
.
 
<EOS>
It
comprehended
all
the
rioters
who
had
been
conspicuous
in
any
of
their
former
proceedings
;
all
those
whom
they
recommended
as
daring
hands
and
fit
for
the
work
;
all
those
whose
companions
had
been
taken
in
the
riots
;
and
a
great
number
of
people
who
were
relatives
or
friends
of
felons
in
the
jail
.
 
<EOS>
This
last
class
included
,
not
only
the
most
desperate
and
utterly
abandoned
villains
in
London
,
but
some
who
were
comparatively
innocent
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
more
than
one
woman
there
,
disguised
in
man
's
attire
,
and
bent
upon
the
rescue
of
a
child
or
brother
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
the
two
sons
of
a
man
who
lay
under
sentence
of
death
,
and
who
was
to
be
executed
along
with
three
others
,
on
the
next
day
but
one
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
great
parry
of
boys
whose
fellow
-
pickpockets
were
in
the
prison
;
and
at
the
skirts
of
all
,
a
score
of
miserable
women
,
outcasts
from
the
world
,
seeking
to
release
some
other
fallen
creature
as
miserable
as
themselves
,
or
moved
by
a
general
sympathy
perhaps
---
God
knows
---
with
all
who
were
without
hope
,
and
wretched
.
  
<EOS>
Old
swords
,
and
pistols
without
ball
or
powder
;
sledge
-
hammers
,
knives
,
axes
,
saws
,
and
weapons
pillaged
from
the
butchers
'
shops
;
a
forest
of
iron
bars
and
wooden
clubs
<EOS>
;
long
ladders
for
scaling
the
walls
,
each
carried
on
the
shoulders
of
a
dozen
men
;
lighted
torches
;
tow
smeared
with
pitch
,
and
tar
,
and
brimstone
;
staves
roughly
plucked
from
fence
and
paling
;
and
even
crutches
taken
from
crippled
beggars
in
the
streets
;
composed
their
arms

<EOS>
When
all
was
ready
,
Hugh
and
Dennis
,
with
Simon
Tappertit
between
them
,
led
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
Roaring
and
chafing
like
an
angry
sea
,
the
crowd
pressed
after
them
.
  
<EOS>
Instead
of
going
straight
down
Holborn
to
the
jail
,
as
all
expected
,
their
leaders
took
the
way
to
Clerkenwell
,
and
pouring
down
a
quiet
street
,
halted
before
a
locksmith
's
house
---
the
Golden
Key
.
  
<EOS>
"
Beat
at
the
door
,
"
cried
Hugh
to
the
men
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
want
one
of
his
craft
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
Beat
it
in
,
if
no
one
answers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
shop
was
shut
.
 
<EOS>
Both
door
and
shutters
were
of
a
strong
and
sturdy
kind
,
and
they
knocked
without
effect
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
impatient
crowd
raising
a
cry
of
"
Set
fire
to
the
house
!
"
<EOS>
and
torches
being
passed
to
the
front
,
an
upper
window
was
thrown
open
,
and
the
stout
old
locksmith
stood
before
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
now
,
you
villains
!
"
<EOS>
he
demanded
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
is
my
daughter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ask
no
questions
of
us
,
old
man
,
"
retorted
Hugh
,
waving
his
comrades
to
be
silent
,
"
but
come
down
,
and
bring
the
tools
of
your
trade
.
 
<EOS>
We
want
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Want
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
locksmith
,
glancing
at
the
regimental
dress
he
wore
:
"
<EOS>
Ay
,
and
if
some
that
I
could
name
possessed
the
hearts
of
mice
,
ye
should
have
had
me
long
ago
.
 
<EOS>
Mark
me
,
my
lad
---
<EOS>
and
you
about
him
do
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
a
score
among
ye
whom
I
see
now
and
know
,
who
are
dead
men
from
this
hour
.
 
<EOS>
Begone
!
<EOS>
and
rob
an
undertaker
's
while
you
can
!
 
<EOS>
You
'll
want
some
coffins
before
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
come
down
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Hugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
give
me
my
daughter
,
ruffian
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
locksmith
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
of
her
,
"
Hugh
rejoined
.
 
<EOS>
"
Burn
the
door
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Stop
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
locksmith
,
in
a
voice
that
made
them
falter
---
 
presenting
,
as
he
spoke
,
a
gun
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
an
old
man
do
that
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
spare
him
better
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
young
fellow
who
held
the
light
,
and
who
was
stooping
down
before
the
door
,
rose
hastily
at
these
words
,
and
fell
back
.
 
<EOS>
The
locksmith
ran
his
eye
along
the
upturned
faces
,
and
kept
the
weapon
levelled
at
the
threshold
of
his
house
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
no
other
rest
than
his
shoulder
,
but
was
as
steady
as
the
house
itself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
the
man
who
does
it
,
take
heed
to
his
prayers
,
"
he
said
firmly
;
"
I
warn
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Snatching
a
torch
from
one
who
stood
near
him
,
Hugh
was
stepping
forward
with
an
oath
,
when
he
was
arrested
by
a
shrill
and
piercing
shriek
,
and
,
looking
upward
,
saw
a
fluttering
garment
on
the
house
-
top
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
another
shriek
,
and
another
,
and
then
a
shrill
voice
cried
,
"
Is
Simmun
below
!
"
<EOS>
At
the
same
moment
a
lean
neck
was
stretched
over
the
parapet
,
and
Miss
Miggs
,
indistinctly
seen
in
the
gathering
gloom
of
evening
,
screeched
in
a
frenzied
manner
,
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
dear
gentlemen
,
let
me
hear
Simmuns
's
answer
from
his
own
lips
.
 
<EOS>
Speak
to
me
,
Simmun
.
 
<EOS>
Speak
to
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Tappertit
,
who
was
not
at
all
flattered
by
this
compliment
,
looked
up
,
and
bidding
her
hold
her
peace
,
ordered
her
to
come
down
and
open
the
door
,
for
they
wanted
her
master
,
and
would
take
no
denial
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
good
gentlemen
!
"
cried
Miss
Miggs
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
my
own
precious
,
precious
Simmun
---
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hold
your
nonsense
,
will
you
!
"
<EOS>
retorted
Mr
Tappertit
;
"
and
come
down
and
open
the
door
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
G
Varden
,
drop
that
gun
,
or
it
will
be
worse
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
mind
his
gun
,
"
screamed
Miggs
.
 
<EOS>
"
Simmun
and
gentlemen
,
I
poured
a
mug
of
table
-
beer
right
down
the
barrel
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
crowd
gave
a
loud
shout
,
which
was
followed
by
a
roar
of
laughter
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
n't
go
off
,
not
if
you
was
to
load
it
up
to
the
muzzle
,
"
screamed
Miggs
.
 
<EOS>
"
Simmun
and
gentlemen
,
I
'm
locked
up
in
the
front
attic
,
through
the
little
door
on
the
right
hand
when
you
think
you
've
got
to
the
very
top
of
the
stairs
<EOS>
---
and
up
the
flight
of
corner
steps
,
being
careful
not
to
knock
your
heads
against
the
rafters
,
and
not
to
tread
on
one
side
in
case
you
should
fall
into
the
two
-
pair
bedroom
through
the
lath
and
plasture
,
which
do
not
bear
,
but
the
contrairy
.
 
<EOS>
Simmun
and
gentlemen
,
I
've
been
locked
up
here
for
safety
,
but
my
endeavours
has
always
been
,
and
always
will
be
,
to
be
on
the
right
side
---
the
blessed
side
and
to
prenounce
the
Pope
of
Babylon
,
and
all
her
inward
and
her
outward
workings
,
which
is
Pagin
.
 
<EOS>
My
sentiments
is
of
little
consequences
,
I
know
,
"
cried
Miggs
,
with
additional
shrillness
,
"
for
my
positions
is
but
a
servant
,
and
as
sich
,
of
humilities
,
still
I
gives
expressions
to
my
feelings
,
and
places
my
reliances
on
them
which
entertains
my
own
opinions
!
"
  
<EOS>
Without
taking
much
notice
of
these
outpourings
of
Miss
Miggs
after
she
had
made
her
first
announcement
in
relation
to
the
gun
,
the
crowd
raised
a
ladder
against
the
window
where
the
locksmith
stood
,
and
notwithstanding
that
he
closed
,
and
fastened
,
and
defended
it
manfully
,
soon
forced
an
entrance
by
shivering
the
glass
and
breaking
in
the
frames
.
 
<EOS>
After
dealing
a
few
stout
blows
about
him
,
he
found
himself
defenceless
,
in
the
midst
of
a
furious
crowd
,
which
overflowed
the
room
and
softened
off
in
a
confused
heap
of
faces
at
the
door
and
window
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
very
wrathful
with
him
(
for
he
had
wounded
two
men
)
,
and
even
called
out
to
those
in
front
,
to
bring
him
forth
and
hang
him
on
a
lamp
-
post
.
 
<EOS>
But
Gabriel
was
quite
undaunted
,
and
looked
from
Hugh
and
Dennis
,
who
held
him
by
either
arm
,
to
Simon
Tappertit
,
who
confronted
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
robbed
me
of
my
daughter
,
"
said
the
locksmith
,
"
who
is
far
dearer
to
me
than
my
life
;
and
you
may
take
my
life
,
if
you
will
.
 
<EOS>
I
bless
God
that
I
have
been
enabled
to
keep
my
wife
free
of
this
scene
;
and
that
He
has
made
me
a
man
who
will
not
ask
mercy
at
such
hands
as
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
a
wery
game
old
gentleman
you
are
,
"
said
Mr
Dennis
,
approvingly
;
"
and
you
express
yourself
like
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
What
's
the
odds
,
brother
,
whether
it
's
a
lamp
-
post
to
-
night
,
or
a
feather
-
bed
ten
year
to
come
,
eh
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
locksmith
glanced
at
him
disdainfully
,
but
returned
no
other
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
my
part
,
"
said
the
hangman
,
who
particularly
favoured
the
lamp
-
post
suggestion
,
"
I
honour
your
principles
.
 
<EOS>
They
're
mine
exactly
.
 
<EOS>
In
such
sentiments
as
them
,
"
and
here
he
emphasised
his
discourse
with
an
oath
,
"
I
'm
ready
to
meet
you
or
any
man
halfway
.
<EOS>
---
 
<EOS>
Have
you
got
a
bit
of
cord
anywheres
handy
?
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
put
yourself
out
of
the
way
,
if
you
have
n't
.
 
<EOS>
A
handkecher
will
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
be
a
fool
,
master
,
"
whispered
Hugh
,
seizing
Varden
roughly
by
the
shoulder
;
"
but
do
as
you
're
bid
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
soon
hear
what
you
're
wanted
for
.
 
<EOS>
Do
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
do
nothing
at
your
request
,
or
that
of
any
scoundrel
here
,
"
returned
the
locksmith
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
want
any
service
from
me
,
you
may
spare
yourselves
the
pains
of
telling
me
what
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
beforehand
,
I
'll
do
nothing
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dennis
was
so
affected
by
this
constancy
on
the
part
of
the
staunch
old
man
,
that
he
protested
---
almost
with
tears
in
his
eyes
---
 
that
to
baulk
his
inclinations
would
be
an
act
of
cruelty
and
hard
dealing
to
which
he
,
for
one
,
never
could
reconcile
his
conscience
.
<EOS>
The
gentleman
,
he
said
,
had
avowed
in
so
many
words
that
he
was
ready
for
working
off
;
such
being
the
case
,
he
considered
it
their
duty
,
as
a
civilised
and
enlightened
crowd
,
to
work
him
off
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
often
,
he
observed
,
that
they
had
it
in
their
power
to
accommodate
themselves
to
the
wishes
of
those
from
whom
they
had
the
misfortune
to
differ
.
 
<EOS>
Having
now
found
an
individual
who
expressed
a
desire
which
they
could
reasonably
indulge
(
and
for
himself
he
was
free
to
confess
that
in
his
opinion
that
desire
did
honour
to
his
feelings
)
,
he
hoped
they
would
decide
to
accede
to
his
proposition
before
going
any
further
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
an
experiment
which
,
skilfully
and
dexterously
performed
,
would
be
over
in
five
minutes
,
with
great
comfort
and
satisfaction
to
all
parties
;
and
though
it
did
not
become
him
(
Mr
Dennis
)
to
speak
well
of
himself
<EOS>
he
trusted
he
might
be
allowed
to
say
that
he
had
practical
knowledge
of
the
subject
,
and
,
being
naturally
of
an
obliging
and
friendly
disposition
,
would
work
the
gentleman
off
with
a
deal
of
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
These
remarks
,
which
were
addressed
in
the
midst
of
a
frightful
din
and
turmoil
to
those
immediately
about
him
,
were
received
with
great
favour
;
not
so
much
,
perhaps
,
because
of
the
hangman
's
eloquence
,
as
on
account
of
the
locksmith
's
obstinacy
.
 
<EOS>
Gabriel
was
in
imminent
peril
,
and
he
knew
it
;
but
he
preserved
a
steady
silence
;
and
would
have
done
so
,
if
they
had
been
debating
whether
they
should
roast
him
at
a
slow
fire
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
hangman
spoke
,
there
was
some
stir
and
confusion
on
the
ladder
;
and
directly
he
was
silent
---
<EOS>
so
immediately
upon
his
holding
his
peace
,
that
the
crowd
below
had
no
time
to
learn
what
he
had
been
saying
,
or
to
shout
in
response
---
<EOS>
some
one
at
the
window
cried
:
  
"
He
has
a
grey
head
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
an
old
man
:
Do
n't
hurt
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
locksmith
turned
,
with
a
start
,
towards
the
place
from
which
the
words
had
come
,
and
looked
hurriedly
at
the
people
who
were
hanging
on
the
ladder
and
clinging
to
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pay
no
respect
to
my
grey
hair
,
young
man
,
"
he
said
,
answering
the
voice
and
not
any
one
he
saw
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
ask
it
.
 
<EOS>
My
heart
is
green
enough
to
scorn
and
despise
every
man
among
you
,
band
of
robbers
that
you
are
!
"
  
<EOS>
This
incautious
speech
by
no
means
tended
to
appease
the
ferocity
of
the
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
They
cried
again
to
have
him
brought
out
;
and
it
would
have
gone
hard
with
the
honest
locksmith
,
but
that
Hugh
reminded
them
,
in
answer
,
that
they
wanted
his
services
,
and
must
have
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
,
tell
him
what
we
want
,
"
he
said
to
Simon
Tappertit
,
"
and
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
And
open
your
ears
,
master
,
if
you
would
ever
use
them
after
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Gabriel
folded
his
arms
,
which
were
now
at
liberty
,
and
eyed
his
old
'
prentice
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lookye
,
Varden
,
"
said
Sim
,
"
we
're
bound
for
Newgate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
are
,
"
returned
the
locksmith
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
never
said
a
truer
word
than
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
burn
it
down
,
I
mean
,
"
said
Simon
,
"
and
force
the
gates
,
and
set
the
prisoners
at
liberty
.
 
<EOS>
You
helped
to
make
the
lock
of
the
great
door
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
,
"
said
the
locksmith
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
owe
me
no
thanks
for
that
---
as
you
'll
find
before
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Maybe
,
"
returned
his
journeyman
,
"
but
you
must
show
us
how
to
force
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Must
I
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
for
you
know
,
and
I
do
n't
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
come
along
with
us
,
and
pick
it
with
your
own
hands
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
I
do
,
"
said
the
locksmith
quietly
,
"
my
hands
shall
drop
off
at
the
wrists
,
and
you
shall
wear
them
,
Simon
Tappertit
,
on
your
shoulders
for
epaulettes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
'll
see
that
,
"
cried
Hugh
,
interposing
,
as
the
indignation
of
the
crowd
again
burst
forth
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
fill
a
basket
with
the
tools
he
'll
want
,
while
I
bring
him
downstairs
.
 
<EOS>
Open
the
doors
below
,
some
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
And
light
the
great
captain
,
others
!
 
<EOS>
Is
there
no
business
afoot
,
my
lads
,
that
you
can
do
nothing
but
stand
and
grumble
?
"
  
<EOS>
They
looked
at
one
another
,
and
quickly
dispersing
,
swarmed
over
the
house
,
plundering
and
breaking
,
according
to
their
custom
,
and
carrying
off
such
articles
of
value
as
happened
to
please
their
fancy
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
no
great
length
of
time
for
these
proceedings
,
for
the
basket
of
tools
was
soon
prepared
and
slung
over
a
man
's
shoulders
.
 
<EOS>
The
preparations
being
now
completed
,
and
everything
ready
for
the
attack
,
those
who
were
pillaging
and
destroying
in
the
other
rooms
were
called
down
to
the
workshop
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
about
to
issue
forth
,
when
the
man
who
had
been
last
upstairs
,
stepped
forward
,
and
asked
if
the
young
woman
in
the
garret
(
who
was
making
a
terrible
noise
,
he
said
,
and
kept
on
screaming
without
the
least
cessation
)
was
to
be
released
?
  
<EOS>
For
his
own
part
,
Simon
Tappertit
would
certainly
have
replied
in
the
negative
,
but
the
mass
of
his
companions
,
mindful
of
the
good
service
she
had
done
in
the
matter
of
the
gun
,
being
of
a
different
opinion
,
he
had
nothing
for
it
but
to
answer
,
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
,
accordingly
,
went
back
again
to
the
rescue
,
and
presently
returned
with
Miss
Miggs
,
limp
and
doubled
up
,
and
very
damp
from
much
weeping
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
young
lady
had
given
no
tokens
of
consciousness
on
their
way
downstairs
,
the
bearer
reported
her
either
dead
or
dying
;
and
being
at
some
loss
what
to
do
with
her
,
was
looking
round
for
a
convenient
bench
or
heap
of
ashes
on
which
to
place
her
senseless
form
,
when
she
suddenly
came
upon
her
feet
by
some
mysterious
means
,
thrust
back
her
hair
,
stared
wildly
at
Mr
Tappertit
,
cried
,
"
My
Simmuns
's
life
is
not
a
wictim
!
"
and
dropped
into
his
arms
with
such
promptitude
that
he
staggered
and
reeled
some
paces
back
,
beneath
his
lovely
burden
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
bother
!
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
.
 
<EOS>
Catch
hold
of
her
,
somebody
.
 
<EOS>
Lock
her
up
again
;
she
never
ought
to
have
been
let
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
Simmun
!
"
cried
Miss
Miggs
,
in
tears
,
and
faintly
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
for
ever
,
ever
blessed
Simmun
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hold
up
,
will
you
,
"
said
Mr
Tappertit
,
in
a
very
unresponsive
tone
,
"
I
'll
let
you
fall
if
you
do
n't
.
 
<EOS>
What
are
you
sliding
your
feet
off
the
ground
for
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
angel
Simmuns
!
"
murmured
Miggs
---
"
he
promised
---
<EOS>
"
  
"
Promised
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
and
I
'll
keep
my
promise
,
"
answered
Simon
,
testily
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
provide
for
you
,
do
n't
I
?
 
<EOS>
Stand
up
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
am
I
to
go
?
 
<EOS>
What
is
to
become
of
me
after
my
actions
of
this
night
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Miggs
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
resting
-
places
now
remains
but
in
the
silent
tombses
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
was
in
the
silent
tombses
,
I
do
,
"
cried
Mr
Tappertit
,
"
and
boxed
up
tight
,
in
a
good
strong
one
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
"
he
cried
to
one
of
the
bystanders
,
in
whose
ear
he
whispered
for
a
moment
:
"
<EOS>
Take
her
off
,
will
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
understand
where
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
fellow
nodded
;
and
taking
her
in
his
arms
,
notwithstanding
her
broken
protestations
,
and
her
struggles
(
which
latter
species
of
opposition
,
involving
scratches
,
was
much
more
difficult
of
resistance
)
,
carried
her
away
.
 
<EOS>
They
who
were
in
the
house
poured
out
into
the
street
;
the
locksmith
was
taken
to
the
head
of
the
crowd
,
and
required
to
walk
between
his
two
conductors
;
the
whole
body
was
put
in
rapid
motion
;
and
without
any
shouts
or
noise
they
bore
down
straight
on
Newgate
,
and
halted
in
a
dense
mass
before
the
prison
-
gate
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
64
    
Breaking
the
silence
they
had
hitherto
preserved
,
they
raised
a
great
cry
as
soon
as
they
were
ranged
before
the
jail
,
and
demanded
to
speak
to
the
governor
.
 
<EOS>
This
visit
was
not
wholly
unexpected
,
for
his
house
,
which
fronted
the
street
,
was
strongly
barricaded
,
the
wicket
-
gate
of
the
prison
was
closed
up
,
and
at
no
loophole
or
grating
was
any
person
to
be
seen
.
 
<EOS>
Before
they
had
repeated
their
summons
many
times
,
a
man
appeared
upon
the
roof
of
the
governor
's
house
,
and
asked
what
it
was
they
wanted
.
  
<EOS>
Some
said
one
thing
,
some
another
,
and
some
only
groaned
and
hissed
.
 
<EOS>
It
being
now
nearly
dark
,
and
the
house
high
,
many
persons
in
the
throng
were
not
aware
that
any
one
had
come
to
answer
them
,
and
continued
their
clamour
until
the
intelligence
was
gradually
diffused
through
the
whole
concourse
.
 
<EOS>
Ten
minutes
or
more
elapsed
before
any
one
voice
could
be
heard
with
tolerable
distinctness
;
during
which
interval
the
figure
remained
perched
alone
,
against
the
summer
-
evening
sky
,
looking
down
into
the
troubled
street
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
,
"
said
Hugh
at
length
,
"
Mr
Akerman
,
the
head
jailer
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
he
is
,
brother
,
"
whispered
Dennis
.
 
<EOS>
But
Hugh
,
without
minding
him
,
took
his
answer
from
the
man
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
got
some
friends
of
ours
in
your
custody
,
master
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
good
many
people
in
my
custody
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
glanced
downward
,
as
he
spoke
,
into
the
jail
:
and
the
feeling
that
he
could
see
into
the
different
yards
,
and
that
he
overlooked
everything
which
was
hidden
from
their
view
by
the
rugged
walls
,
so
lashed
and
goaded
the
mob
,
that
they
howled
like
wolves
.
  
<EOS>
"
Deliver
up
our
friends
,
"
said
Hugh
,
"
and
you
may
keep
the
rest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
my
duty
to
keep
them
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
do
my
duty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
n't
throw
the
doors
open
,
we
shall
break
'em
down
,
"
said
Hugh
;
"
for
we
will
have
the
rioters
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
I
can
do
,
good
people
,
"
Akerman
replied
,
"
is
to
exhort
you
to
disperse
;
and
to
remind
you
that
the
consequences
of
any
disturbance
in
this
place
,
will
be
very
severe
,
and
bitterly
repented
by
most
of
you
,
when
it
is
too
late
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
made
as
though
he
would
retire
when
he
said
these
words
,
but
he
was
checked
by
the
voice
of
the
locksmith
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Akerman
,
"
cried
Gabriel
,
"
Mr
Akerman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
hear
no
more
from
any
of
you
,
"
replied
the
governor
,
turning
towards
the
speaker
,
and
waving
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
not
one
of
them
,
"
said
Gabriel
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
an
honest
man
,
Mr
Akerman
;
a
respectable
tradesman
---
Gabriel
Varden
,
the
locksmith
.
<EOS>
You
know
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
You
among
the
crowd
!
"
cried
the
governor
in
an
altered
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Brought
here
by
force
---
brought
here
to
pick
the
lock
of
the
great
door
for
them
,
"
rejoined
the
locksmith
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bear
witness
for
me
,
Mr
Akerman
<EOS>
,
that
I
refuse
to
do
it
;
and
that
I
will
not
do
it
,
come
what
may
of
my
refusal
.
 
<EOS>
If
any
violence
is
done
to
me
,
please
to
remember
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
there
no
way
(
if
helping
you
?
"
said
the
governor
.
  
<EOS>
"
None
,
Mr
Akerman
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
do
your
duty
,
and
I
'll
do
mine
.
 
<EOS>
Once
again
,
you
robbers
and
cut
-
throats
,
"
said
the
locksmith
,
turning
round
upon
them
,
"
I
refuse
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
Howl
<EOS>
till
you
're
hoarse
.
 
<EOS>
I
refuse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Stay
---
stay
!
"
said
the
jailer
,
hastily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Varden
,
I
know
you
for
a
worthy
man
,
and
one
who
would
do
no
unlawful
act
except
upon
compulsion
---
<EOS>
"
  
"
Upon
compulsion
,
sir
,
"
interposed
the
locksmith
,
who
felt
that
the
tone
in
which
this
was
said
,
conveyed
the
speaker
's
impression
that
he
had
ample
excuse
for
yielding
to
the
furious
multitude
who
beset
and
hemmed
him
in
,
on
every
side
,
and
among
whom
he
stood
,
an
old
man
,
quite
alone
;
"
upon
compulsion
,
sir
,
I
'll
do
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
that
man
,
"
said
the
keeper
,
anxiously
,
"
who
spoke
to
me
just
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Here
!
"
<EOS>
Hugh
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
what
the
guilt
of
murder
is
,
and
that
by
keeping
that
honest
tradesman
at
your
side
you
endanger
his
life
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
know
it
very
well
,
"
he
answered
,
"
for
what
else
did
we
bring
him
here
?
 
<EOS>
Let
's
have
our
friends
,
master
,
and
you
shall
have
your
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Is
that
fair
,
lads
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
mob
replied
to
him
with
a
loud
Hurrah
!
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
how
it
is
,
sir
?
"
cried
Varden
.
 
<EOS>
"
Keep
'em
out
,
in
King
George
's
name
.
 
<EOS>
Remember
what
I
have
said
.
 
<EOS>
Good
night
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
more
parley
.
 
<EOS>
A
shower
of
stones
and
other
missiles
compelled
the
keeper
of
the
jail
to
retire
;
and
the
mob
,
pressing
on
,
and
swarming
round
the
walls
,
forced
Gabriel
Varden
close
up
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
In
vain
the
basket
of
tools
was
laid
upon
the
ground
before
him
,
and
he
was
urged
in
turn
by
promises
,
by
blows
,
by
offers
of
reward
,
and
threats
of
instant
death
,
to
do
the
office
for
which
they
had
brought
him
there
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
cried
the
sturdy
locksmith
,
"
I
will
not
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
never
loved
his
life
so
well
as
then
,
but
nothing
could
move
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
savage
faces
that
glared
upon
him
,
look
where
he
would
;
the
cries
of
those
who
thirsted
,
like
wild
animals
,
for
his
blood
;
the
sight
of
men
pressing
forward
,
and
trampling
down
their
fellows
,
as
they
strove
to
reach
him
,
and
struck
at
him
above
the
heads
of
other
men
,
with
axes
and
with
iron
bars
;
all
failed
to
daunt
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
from
man
to
man
,
and
face
to
face
,
and
still
,
with
quickened
breath
and
lessening
colour
,
cried
firmly
,
"
I
will
not
!
"
  
<EOS>
Dennis
dealt
him
a
blow
upon
the
face
which
felled
him
to
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
He
sprung
up
again
like
a
man
in
the
prime
of
life
,
and
with
blood
upon
his
forehead
,
caught
him
by
the
throat
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
cowardly
dog
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
:
"
Give
me
my
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
Give
me
my
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
struggled
together
.
 
<EOS>
Some
cried
"
Kill
him
,
"
and
some
(
but
they
were
not
near
enough
)
strove
to
trample
him
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
Tug
as
he
would
at
the
old
man
's
wrists
,
the
hangman
could
not
force
him
to
unclench
his
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
this
all
the
return
you
make
me
,
you
ungrateful
monster
?
"
<EOS>
he
articulated
with
great
difficulty
,
and
with
many
oaths
.
  
<EOS>
"
Give
me
my
daughter
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
locksmith
,
who
was
now
as
fierce
as
those
who
gathered
round
him
:
"
Give
me
my
daughter
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
down
again
,
and
up
,
and
down
once
more
,
and
buffeting
with
a
score
of
them
,
who
bandied
him
from
hand
to
hand
,
when
one
tall
fellow
,
fresh
from
a
slaughter
-
house
,
whose
dress
and
great
thigh
-
boots
smoked
hot
with
grease
and
blood
,
raised
a
pole
-
axe
,
and
swearing
a
horrible
oath
,
aimed
it
at
the
old
man
's
uncovered
head
.
<EOS>
At
that
instant
,
and
in
the
very
act
,
he
fell
himself
,
as
if
struck
by
lightning
,
and
over
his
body
a
one
-
armed
man
came
darting
to
the
locksmith
's
side
.
 
<EOS>
Another
man
was
with
him
,
and
both
caught
the
locksmith
roughly
in
their
grasp
.
  
<EOS>
"
Leave
him
to
us
!
"
<EOS>
they
cried
to
Hugh
---
struggling
,
as
they
spoke
,
to
force
a
passage
backward
through
the
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
"
Leave
him
to
us
.
<EOS>
Why
do
you
waste
your
whole
strength
on
such
as
he
,
when
a
couple
of
men
can
finish
him
in
as
many
minutes
!
 
<EOS>
You
lose
time
.
 
<EOS>
Remember
the
prisoners
!
<EOS>
remember
Barnaby
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
cry
ran
through
the
mob
.
 
<EOS>
Hammers
began
to
rattle
on
the
walls
;
and
every
man
strove
to
reach
the
prison
,
and
be
among
the
foremost
rank
.
 
<EOS>
Fighting
their
way
through
the
press
and
struggle
,
as
desperately
as
if
they
were
in
the
midst
of
enemies
rather
than
their
own
friends
,
the
two
men
retreated
with
the
locksmith
between
them
,
and
dragged
him
through
the
very
heart
of
the
concourse
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
the
strokes
began
to
fall
like
hail
upon
the
gate
,
and
on
the
strong
building
;
for
those
who
could
not
reach
the
door
,
spent
their
fierce
rage
on
anything
---
even
on
the
great
blocks
of
stone
,
which
shivered
their
weapons
into
fragments
,
and
made
their
hands
and
arms
to
tingle
as
if
the
walls
were
active
in
their
stout
resistance
,
and
dealt
them
back
their
blows
.
 
<EOS>
The
clash
of
iron
ringing
upon
iron
,
mingled
with
the
deafening
tumult
and
sounded
high
above
it
,
as
the
great
sledge
-
hammers
rattled
on
the
nailed
and
plated
door
<EOS>
:
the
sparks
flew
off
in
showers
;
men
worked
in
gangs
,
and
at
short
intervals
relieved
each
other
,
that
all
their
strength
might
be
devoted
to
the
work
;
but
there
stood
the
portal
still
,
as
grim
and
dark
and
strong
as
ever
,
and
,
saving
for
the
dints
upon
its
battered
surface
,
quite
unchanged
.
  
<EOS>
While
some
brought
all
their
energies
to
bear
upon
this
toilsome
task
;
and
some
,
rearing
ladders
against
the
prison
,
tried
to
clamber
to
the
summit
of
the
walls
they
were
too
short
to
scale
;
and
some
again
engaged
a
body
of
police
a
hundred
strong
,
and
beat
them
back
and
trod
them
under
foot
by
force
of
numbers
;
others
besieged
the
house
on
which
the
jailer
had
appeared
,
and
driving
in
the
door
,
brought
out
his
furniture
,
and
piled
it
up
against
the
prison
-
gate
,
to
make
a
bonfire
which
should
burn
it
down
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
this
device
was
understood
,
all
those
who
had
laboured
hitherto
,
cast
down
their
tools
and
helped
to
swell
the
heap
;
which
reached
half
-
way
across
the
street
,
and
was
so
high
,
that
those
who
threw
more
fuel
on
the
top
,
got
up
by
ladders
.
 
<EOS>
When
all
the
keeper
's
goods
were
flung
upon
this
costly
pile
,
to
the
last
fragment
,
they
smeared
it
with
the
pitch
,
and
tar
,
and
rosin
they
had
brought
,
and
sprinkled
it
with
turpentine
.
 
<EOS>
To
all
the
woodwork
round
the
prison
-
doors
<EOS>
they
did
the
like
,
leaving
not
a
joist
or
beam
untouched
.
 
<EOS>
This
infernal
christening
performed
,
they
fired
the
pile
with
lighted
matches
and
with
blazing
tow
,
and
then
stood
by
,
awaiting
the
result
.
  
<EOS>
The
furniture
being
very
dry
,
and
rendered
more
combustible
by
wax
and
oil
,
besides
the
arts
they
had
used
,
took
fire
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
The
flames
roared
high
and
fiercely
,
blackening
the
prison
-
wall
,
and
twining
up
its
loftly
front
like
burning
serpents
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
they
crowded
round
the
blaze
,
and
vented
their
exultation
only
in
their
looks
:
but
when
it
grew
hotter
and
fiercer
---
when
it
crackled
,
leaped
,
and
roared
,
like
a
great
furnace
---
when
it
shone
upon
the
opposite
houses
,
and
lighted
up
not
only
the
pale
and
wondering
faces
at
the
windows
,
but
the
inmost
corners
of
each
habitation
---
 
when
through
the
deep
red
heat
and
glow
,
the
fire
was
seen
sporting
and
toying
with
the
door
,
now
clinging
to
its
obdurate
surface
,
now
gliding
off
with
fierce
inconstancy
and
soaring
high
into
the
sky
,
anon
returning
to
fold
it
in
its
burning
grasp
and
lure
it
to
its
ruin
---
when
it
shone
and
gleamed
so
brightly
that
the
church
clock
of
St
Sepulchre
's
so
often
pointing
to
the
hour
of
death
,
was
legible
as
in
broad
day
,
and
the
vane
upon
its
steeple
-
top
glittered
in
the
unwonted
light
like
something
richly
jewelled
---
 
when
blackened
stone
and
sombre
brick
grew
ruddy
in
the
deep
reflection
,
and
windows
shone
like
burnished
gold
,
dotting
the
longest
distance
in
the
fiery
vista
with
their
specks
of
brightness
---
when
wall
and
tower
,
and
roof
and
chimney
-
stack
,
seemed
drunk
,
and
in
the
flickering
glare
appeared
to
reel
and
stagger
---
 
<EOS>
when
scores
of
objects
,
never
seen
before
,
burst
out
upon
the
view
,
and
things
the
most
familiar
put
on
some
new
aspect
---
then
the
mob
began
to
join
the
whirl
,
and
with
loud
yells
,
and
shouts
,
and
clamour
,
such
as
happily
is
seldom
heard
,
bestirred
themselves
to
feed
the
fire
,
and
keep
it
at
its
height
.
  
<EOS>
Although
the
heat
was
so
intense
that
the
paint
on
the
houses
over
against
the
prison
,
parched
and
crackled
up
,
and
swelling
into
boils
,
as
it
were
from
excess
of
torture
,
broke
and
crumbled
away
;
although
the
glass
fell
from
the
window
-
sashes
,
and
the
lead
and
iron
on
the
roofs
blistered
the
incautious
hand
that
touched
them
,
and
the
sparrows
in
the
eaves
took
wing
,
and
rendered
giddy
by
the
smoke
,
fell
fluttering
down
upon
the
blazing
pile
;
still
the
fire
was
tended
unceasingly
by
busy
hands
,
and
round
it
,
men
were
going
always
.
 
<EOS>
They
never
slackened
in
their
zeal
,
or
kept
aloof
,
but
pressed
upon
the
flames
so
hard
,
that
those
in
front
had
much
ado
to
save
themselves
from
being
thrust
in
;
if
one
man
swooned
or
dropped
,
a
dozen
struggled
for
his
place
,
and
that
although
they
knew
the
pain
,
and
thirst
,
and
pressure
to
be
unendurable
.
 
<EOS>
Those
who
fell
down
in
fainting
-
fits
,
and
were
not
crushed
or
burnt
,
were
carried
to
an
inn
-
yard
close
at
hand
,
and
dashed
with
water
from
a
pump
;
of
which
buckets
full
were
passed
from
man
to
man
among
the
crowd
;
but
such
was
the
strong
desire
of
all
to
drink
,
and
such
the
fighting
to
be
first
,
that
,
for
the
most
part
,
the
whole
contents
were
spilled
upon
the
ground
,
without
the
lips
of
one
man
being
moistened
.
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
and
in
the
midst
of
all
the
roar
and
outcry
,
those
who
were
nearest
to
the
pile
,
heaped
up
again
the
burning
fragments
that
came
toppling
down
,
and
raked
the
fire
about
the
door
,
which
,
although
a
sheet
of
flame
,
was
still
a
door
fast
locked
and
barred
,
and
kept
them
out
.
 
<EOS>
Great
pieces
of
blazing
wood
were
passed
,
besides
,
above
the
people
's
heads
to
such
as
stood
about
the
ladders
,
and
some
of
these
,
climbing
up
to
the
topmost
stave
,
and
holding
on
with
one
hand
by
the
prison
wall
,
exerted
all
their
skill
and
force
to
cast
these
fire
-
brands
on
the
roof
,
or
down
into
the
yards
within
.
 
<EOS>
In
many
instances
their
efforts
were
successful
;
which
occasioned
a
new
and
appalling
addition
to
the
horrors
of
the
scene
:
for
the
prisoners
within
,
seeing
from
between
their
bars
that
the
fire
caught
in
many
places
and
thrived
fiercely
,
and
being
all
locked
up
in
strong
cells
for
the
night
,
began
to
know
that
they
were
in
danger
of
being
burnt
alive
.
 
<EOS>
This
terrible
fear
,
spreading
from
cell
to
cell
and
from
yard
to
yard
,
vented
itself
in
such
dismal
cries
and
wailings
,
and
in
such
dreadful
shrieks
for
help
,
that
the
whole
jail
resounded
with
the
noise
;
which
was
loudly
heard
even
above
the
shouting
of
the
mob
and
roaring
of
the
flames
,
and
was
so
full
of
agony
and
despair
,
that
it
made
the
boldest
tremble
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
remarkable
that
these
cries
began
in
that
quarter
of
the
jail
which
fronted
Newgate
Street
,
where
,
it
was
well
known
,
the
men
who
were
to
suffer
death
on
Thursday
were
confined
.
 
<EOS>
And
not
only
were
these
four
who
had
so
short
a
time
to
live
,
the
first
to
whom
the
dread
of
being
burnt
occurred
,
but
they
were
,
throughout
,
the
most
importunate
of
all
:
for
they
could
be
plainly
heard
,
notwithstanding
the
great
thickness
of
the
walls
,
crying
that
the
wind
set
that
way
,
and
that
the
flames
would
shortly
reach
them
;
and
calling
to
the
officers
of
the
jail
to
come
and
quench
the
fire
from
a
cistern
which
was
in
their
yard
,
and
full
of
water
.
<EOS>
Judging
from
what
the
crowd
outside
the
walls
could
hear
from
time
to
time
,
these
four
doomed
wretches
never
ceased
to
call
for
help
;
and
that
with
as
much
distraction
,
and
in
as
great
a
frenzy
of
attachment
to
existence
,
as
though
each
had
an
honoured
,
happy
life
before
him
,
instead
of
eight
-
and
-
forty
hours
of
miserable
imprisonment
,
and
then
a
violent
and
shameful
death
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
anguish
and
suffering
of
the
two
sons
of
one
of
these
men
,
when
they
heard
,
or
fancied
that
they
heard
,
their
father
's
voice
,
is
past
description
.
 
<EOS>
After
wringing
their
hands
and
rushing
to
and
fro
as
if
they
were
stark
mad
,
one
mounted
on
the
shoulders
of
his
brother
,
and
tried
to
clamber
up
the
face
of
the
high
wall
,
guarded
at
the
top
with
spikes
and
points
of
iron
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
he
fell
among
the
crowd
,
he
was
not
deterred
by
his
bruises
,
but
mounted
up
again
,
and
fell
again
,
and
,
when
he
found
the
feat
impossible
,
began
to
beat
the
stones
and
tear
them
with
his
hands
,
as
if
he
could
that
way
make
a
breach
in
the
strong
building
,
and
force
a
passage
in
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
they
cleft
their
way
among
the
mob
about
the
door
,
though
many
men
,
a
dozen
times
their
match
,
had
tried
in
vain
to
do
so
,
and
were
seen
,
in
---
yes
,
in
---
the
fire
,
striving
to
prize
it
down
,
with
crowbars
.
  
<EOS>
Nor
were
they
alone
affected
by
the
outcry
from
within
the
prison
.
<EOS>
The
women
who
were
looking
on
,
shrieked
loudly
,
beat
their
hands
together
,
stopped
their
ears
;
and
many
fainted
:
the
men
who
were
not
near
the
walls
and
active
in
the
siege
,
rather
than
do
nothing
,
tore
up
the
pavement
of
the
street
,
and
did
so
with
a
haste
and
fury
they
could
not
have
surpassed
if
that
had
been
the
jail
,
and
they
were
near
their
object
.
 
<EOS>
Not
one
living
creature
in
the
throng
was
for
an
instant
still
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
great
mass
were
mad
.
  
<EOS>
A
shout
!
 
<EOS>
Another
!
 
<EOS>
Another
yet
,
though
few
knew
why
,
or
what
it
meant
.
 
<EOS>
But
those
around
the
gate
had
seen
it
slowly
yield
,
and
drop
from
its
topmost
hinge
.
 
<EOS>
It
hung
on
that
side
by
but
one
,
but
it
was
upright
still
,
because
of
the
bar
,
and
its
having
sunk
,
of
its
own
weight
,
into
the
heap
of
ashes
at
its
foot
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
now
a
gap
at
the
top
of
the
doorway
,
through
which
could
be
descried
a
gloomy
passage
,
cavernous
and
dark
.
 
<EOS>
Pile
up
the
fire
!
  
<EOS>
It
burnt
fiercely
.
 
<EOS>
The
door
was
red
-
hot
,
and
the
gap
wider
.
 
<EOS>
They
vainly
tried
to
shield
their
faces
with
their
hands
,
and
standing
as
if
in
readiness
for
a
spring
,
watched
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
Dark
figures
,
some
crawling
on
their
hands
and
knees
,
some
carried
in
the
arms
of
others
,
were
seen
to
pass
along
the
roof
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
plain
the
jail
could
hold
out
no
longer
.
 
<EOS>
The
keeper
,
and
his
officers
,
and
their
wives
and
children
,
were
escaping
.
 
<EOS>
Pile
up
the
fire
!
  
<EOS>
The
door
sank
down
again
:
it
settled
deeper
in
the
cinders
---
 
tottered
---
yielded
---
was
down
!
  
<EOS>
As
they
shouted
again
,
they
fell
back
,
for
a
moment
,
and
left
a
clear
space
about
the
fire
that
lay
between
them
and
the
jail
entry
.
 
<EOS>
Hugh
leapt
upon
the
blazing
heap
,
and
scattering
a
train
of
sparks
into
the
air
,
and
making
the
dark
lobby
glitter
with
those
that
hung
upon
his
dress
,
dashed
into
the
jail
.
  
<EOS>
The
hangman
followed
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
so
many
rushed
upon
their
track
,
that
the
fire
got
trodden
down
and
thinly
strewn
about
the
street
;
but
there
was
no
need
of
it
now
,
for
,
inside
and
out
,
the
prison
was
in
flames
.

Chapter
65
    
<EOS>
During
the
whole
course
of
the
terrible
scene
which
was
now
at
its
height
,
one
man
in
the
jail
suffered
a
degree
of
fear
and
mental
torment
which
had
no
parallel
in
the
endurance
,
even
of
those
who
lay
under
sentence
of
death
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
rioters
first
assembled
before
the
building
,
the
murderer
was
roused
from
sleep
---
if
such
slumbers
as
his
may
have
that
blessed
name
---
by
the
roar
of
voices
,
and
the
struggling
of
a
great
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
He
started
up
as
these
sounds
met
his
ear
,
and
,
sitting
on
his
bedstead
,
listened
.
  
<EOS>
After
a
short
interval
of
silence
the
noise
burst
out
again
.
 
<EOS>
Still
listening
attentively
,
he
made
out
,
in
course
of
time
,
that
the
jail
was
besieged
by
a
furious
multitude
.
 
<EOS>
His
guilty
conscience
instantly
arrayed
these
men
against
himself
,
and
brought
the
fear
upon
him
that
he
would
be
singled
out
,
and
torn
to
pieces
.
  
<EOS>
Once
impressed
with
the
terror
of
this
conceit
,
everything
tended
to
confirm
and
strengthen
it
.
 
<EOS>
His
double
crime
,
the
circumstances
under
which
it
had
been
committed
,
the
length
of
time
that
had
elapsed
,
and
its
discovery
in
spite
of
all
,
made
him
,
as
it
were
,
the
visible
object
of
the
Almighty
's
wrath
.
 
<EOS>
In
all
the
crime
and
vice
and
moral
gloom
of
the
great
pest
-
house
of
the
capital
,
he
stood
alone
,
marked
and
singled
out
by
his
great
guilt
,
a
Lucifer
among
the
devils
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
prisoners
were
a
host
,
hiding
and
sheltering
each
other
---
a
crowd
like
that
without
the
walls
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
one
man
against
the
whole
united
concourse
;
a
single
,
solitary
,
lonely
man
,
from
whom
the
very
captives
in
the
jail
fell
off
and
shrunk
appalled
.
  
<EOS>
It
might
be
that
the
intelligence
of
his
capture
having
been
bruited
abroad
,
they
had
come
there
purposely
to
drag
him
out
and
kill
him
in
the
street
;
or
it
might
be
that
they
were
the
rioters
,
and
,
in
pursuance
of
an
old
design
,
had
come
to
sack
the
prison
.
<EOS>
But
in
either
case
he
had
no
belief
or
hope
that
they
would
spare
him
.
 
<EOS>
Every
shout
they
raised
,
and
every
sound
they
made
,
was
a
blow
upon
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
attack
went
on
,
he
grew
more
wild
and
frantic
in
his
terror
:
tried
to
pull
away
the
bars
that
guarded
the
chimney
and
prevented
him
from
climbing
up
:
called
loudly
on
the
turnkeys
to
cluster
round
the
cell
and
save
him
from
the
fury
of
the
rabble
;
or
put
him
in
some
dungeon
underground
,
no
matter
of
what
depth
,
how
dark
it
was
,
or
loathsome
,
or
beset
with
rats
and
creeping
things
,
so
that
it
hid
him
and
was
hard
to
find
.
  
<EOS>
But
no
one
came
,
or
answered
him
.
 
<EOS>
Fearful
,
even
while
he
cried
to
them
,
of
attracting
attention
,
he
was
silent
.
 
<EOS>
By
and
bye
<EOS>
,
he
saw
,
as
he
looked
from
his
grated
window
,
a
strange
glimmering
on
the
stone
walls
and
pavement
of
the
yard
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
feeble
at
first
,
and
came
and
went
,
as
though
some
officers
with
torches
were
passing
to
and
fro
upon
the
roof
of
the
prison
.
 
<EOS>
Soon
it
reddened
,
and
lighted
brands
came
whirling
down
,
spattering
the
ground
with
fire
,
and
burning
sullenly
in
corners
.
 
<EOS>
One
rolled
beneath
a
wooden
bench
,
and
set
it
in
a
blaze
;
another
caught
a
water
-
spout
,
and
so
went
climbing
up
the
wall
,
leaving
a
long
straight
track
of
fire
behind
it
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
time
,
a
slow
thick
shower
of
burning
fragments
,
from
some
upper
portion
of
the
prison
which
was
blazing
nigh
,
began
to
fall
before
his
door
.
 
<EOS>
Remembering
that
it
opened
outwards
,
he
knew
that
every
spark
which
fell
upon
the
heap
,
and
in
the
act
lost
its
bright
life
,
and
died
an
ugly
speck
of
dust
and
rubbish
,
helped
to
entomb
him
in
a
living
grave
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
though
the
jail
resounded
with
shrieks
and
cries
for
help
,
---
though
the
fire
bounded
up
as
if
each
separate
flame
had
had
a
tiger
's
life
,
and
roared
as
though
,
in
every
one
,
there
were
a
hungry
voice
---
though
the
heat
began
to
grow
intense
,
and
the
air
suffocating
,
and
the
clamour
without
increased
,
and
the
danger
of
his
situation
even
from
one
merciless
element
was
every
moment
more
extreme
,
---
<EOS>
still
he
was
afraid
to
raise
his
voice
again
,
lest
the
crowd
should
break
in
,
and
should
,
of
their
own
ears
or
from
the
information
given
them
by
the
other
prisoners
,
get
the
clue
to
his
place
of
confinement
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
fearful
alike
,
of
those
within
the
prison
and
of
those
without
;
of
noise
and
silence
;
light
and
darkness
;
of
being
released
,
and
being
left
there
to
die
;
he
was
so
tortured
and
tormented
,
that
nothing
man
has
ever
done
to
man
in
the
horrible
caprice
of
power
and
cruelty
,
exceeds
his
self
-
inflicted
punishment
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
now
,
the
door
was
down
.
 
<EOS>
Now
they
came
rushing
through
the
jail
,
calling
to
each
other
in
the
vaulted
passages
;
clashing
the
iron
gates
dividing
yard
from
yard
;
beating
at
the
doors
of
cells
and
wards
;
wrenching
off
bolts
and
locks
and
bars
;
tearing
down
the
door
-
posts
to
get
men
out
;
endeavouring
to
drag
them
by
main
force
through
gaps
and
windows
where
a
child
could
scarcely
pass
;
whooping
and
yelling
without
a
moment
's
rest
;
and
running
through
the
heat
and
flames
as
if
they
were
cased
in
metal
.
 
<EOS>
By
their
legs
,
their
arms
,
the
hair
upon
their
heads
,
they
dragged
the
prisoners
out
.
 
<EOS>
Some
threw
themselves
upon
the
captives
as
they
got
towards
the
door
,
and
tried
to
file
away
their
irons
;
some
danced
about
them
with
a
frenzied
joy
,
and
rent
their
clothes
,
and
were
ready
,
as
it
seemed
,
to
tear
them
limb
from
limb
.
 
<EOS>
Now
a
party
of
a
dozen
men
came
darting
through
the
yard
into
which
the
murderer
cast
fearful
glances
from
his
darkened
window
;
dragging
a
prisoner
along
the
ground
whose
dress
they
had
nearly
torn
from
his
body
in
their
mad
eagerness
to
set
him
free
,
and
who
was
bleeding
and
senseless
in
their
hands
.
 
<EOS>
Now
a
score
of
prisoners
ran
to
and
fro
,
who
had
lost
themselves
in
the
intricacies
of
the
prison
,
and
were
so
bewildered
with
the
noise
and
glare
that
they
knew
not
where
to
turn
or
what
to
do
,
and
still
cried
out
for
help
,
as
loudly
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
Anon
some
famished
wretch
whose
theft
had
been
a
loaf
of
bread
,
or
scrap
of
butcher
's
meat
,
came
skulking
past
,
barefooted
---
 
<EOS>
going
slowly
away
because
that
jail
,
his
house
,
was
burning
;
not
because
he
had
any
other
,
or
had
friends
to
meet
,
or
old
haunts
to
revisit
,
or
any
liberty
to
gain
,
but
liberty
to
starve
and
die
.
<EOS>
And
then
a
knot
of
highwaymen
went
trooping
by
,
conducted
by
the
friends
they
had
among
the
crowd
,
who
muffled
their
fetters
as
they
went
along
,
with
handkerchiefs
and
bands
of
hay
,
and
wrapped
them
in
coats
and
cloaks
,
and
gave
them
drink
from
bottles
,
and
held
it
to
their
lips
,
because
of
their
handcuffs
which
there
was
no
time
to
remove
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
,
and
<EOS>
Heaven
knows
how
much
more
,
was
done
amidst
a
noise
,
a
hurry
,
and
distraction
,
like
nothing
that
we
know
of
,
even
in
our
dreams
;
which
seemed
for
ever
on
the
rise
,
and
never
to
decrease
for
the
space
of
a
single
instant
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
still
looking
down
from
his
window
upon
these
things
,
when
a
band
of
men
with
torches
,
ladders
,
axes
,
and
many
kinds
of
weapons
,
poured
into
the
yard
,
and
hammering
at
his
door
,
inquired
if
there
were
any
prisoner
within
.
 
<EOS>
He
left
the
window
when
he
saw
them
coming
,
and
drew
back
into
the
remotest
corner
of
the
cell
;
but
although
he
returned
them
no
answer
,
they
had
a
fancy
that
some
one
was
inside
,
for
they
presently
set
ladders
against
it
,
and
began
to
tear
away
the
bars
at
the
casement
;
not
only
that
,
indeed
,
but
with
pickaxes
to
hew
down
the
very
stones
in
the
wall
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
they
had
made
a
breach
at
the
window
,
large
enough
for
the
admission
of
a
man
's
head
,
one
of
them
thrust
in
a
torch
and
looked
all
round
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
He
followed
this
man
's
gaze
until
it
rested
on
himself
,
and
heard
him
demand
why
he
had
not
answered
,
but
made
him
no
reply
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
general
surprise
and
wonder
,
they
were
used
to
this
;
without
saying
anything
more
,
they
enlarged
the
breach
until
it
was
large
enough
to
admit
the
body
of
a
man
,
and
then
came
dropping
down
upon
the
floor
,
one
after
another
,
until
the
cell
was
full
.
 
<EOS>
They
caught
him
up
among
them
,
handed
him
to
the
window
,
and
those
who
stood
upon
the
ladders
passed
him
down
upon
the
pavement
of
the
yard
.
<EOS>
Then
the
rest
came
out
,
one
after
another
,
and
,
bidding
him
fly
,
and
lose
no
time
,
or
the
way
would
be
choked
up
,
hurried
away
to
rescue
others
.
  
<EOS>
It
seemed
not
a
minute
's
work
from
first
to
last
.
 
<EOS>
He
staggered
to
his
feet
,
incredulous
of
what
had
happened
,
when
the
yard
was
filled
again
,
and
a
crowd
rushed
on
,
hurrying
Barnaby
among
them
.
<EOS>
In
another
minute
---
not
so
much
:
another
minute
!
<EOS>
the
same
instant
,
with
no
lapse
or
interval
between
!
---
he
and
his
son
were
being
passed
from
hand
to
hand
,
through
the
dense
crowd
in
the
street
,
and
were
glancing
backward
at
a
burning
pile
which
some
one
said
was
Newgate
.
  
<EOS>
From
the
moment
of
their
first
entrance
into
the
prison
,
the
crowd
dispersed
themselves
about
it
,
and
swarmed
into
every
chink
and
crevice
,
as
if
they
had
a
perfect
acquaintance
with
its
innermost
parts
,
and
bore
in
their
minds
an
exact
plan
of
the
whole
.
 
<EOS>
For
this
immediate
knowledge
of
the
place
,
they
were
,
no
doubt
,
in
a
great
degree
,
indebted
to
the
hangman
,
who
stood
in
the
lobby
,
directing
some
to
go
this
way
,
some
that
,
and
some
the
other
;
and
who
materially
assisted
in
bringing
about
the
wonderful
rapidity
with
which
the
release
of
the
prisoners
was
effected
.
  
<EOS>
But
this
functionary
of
the
law
reserved
one
important
piece
of
intelligence
,
and
kept
it
snugly
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
issued
his
instructions
relative
to
every
other
part
of
the
building
,
and
the
mob
were
dispersed
from
end
to
end
,
and
busy
at
their
work
,
he
took
a
bundle
of
keys
from
a
kind
of
cupboard
in
the
wall
,
and
going
by
a
kind
of
passage
near
the
chapel
<EOS>
(
it
joined
the
governors
house
,
and
was
then
on
fire
)
,
betook
himself
to
the
condemned
cells
,
which
were
a
series
of
small
,
strong
,
dismal
rooms
,
opening
on
a
low
gallery
,
guarded
,
at
the
end
at
which
he
entered
,
by
a
strong
iron
wicket
,
and
at
its
opposite
extremity
by
two
doors
and
a
thick
grate
.
 
<EOS>
Having
double
locked
the
wicket
,
and
assured
himself
that
the
other
entrances
were
well
secured
,
he
sat
down
on
a
bench
in
the
gallery
,
and
sucked
the
head
of
his
stick
with
the
utmost
complacency
,
tranquillity
,
and
contentment
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
strange
enough
,
a
man
's
enjoying
himself
in
this
quiet
manner
,
while
the
prison
was
burning
,
and
such
a
tumult
was
cleaving
the
air
,
though
he
had
been
outside
the
walls
.
 
<EOS>
But
here
,
in
the
very
heart
of
the
building
,
and
moreover
with
the
prayers
and
cries
of
the
four
men
under
sentence
sounding
in
his
ears
,
and
their
hands
,
stretched
our
through
the
gratings
in
their
cell
-
doors
,
clasped
in
frantic
entreaty
before
his
very
eyes
,
it
was
particularly
remarkable
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Mr
Dennis
appeared
to
think
it
an
uncommon
circumstance
,
and
to
banter
himself
upon
it
;
for
he
thrust
his
hat
on
one
side
as
some
men
do
when
they
are
in
a
waggish
humour
,
sucked
the
head
of
his
stick
with
a
higher
relish
,
and
smiled
as
though
he
would
say
,
"
Dennis
,
you
're
a
rum
dog
;
you
're
a
queer
fellow
;
you
're
capital
company
,
Dennis
,
and
quite
a
character
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
sat
in
this
way
for
some
minutes
,
while
the
four
men
in
the
cells
,
who
were
certain
that
somebody
had
entered
the
gallery
,
but
could
not
see
who
,
gave
vent
to
such
piteous
entreaties
as
wretches
in
their
miserable
condition
may
be
supposed
to
have
been
inspired
with
:
urging
,
whoever
it
was
,
to
set
them
at
liberty
,
for
the
love
of
Heaven
;
and
protesting
,
with
great
fervour
,
and
truly
enough
,
perhaps
,
for
the
time
,
that
if
they
escaped
,
they
would
amend
their
ways
,
and
would
never
,
never
,
never
again
do
wrong
before
God
or
man
,
but
would
lead
penitent
and
sober
lives
,
and
sorrowfully
repent
the
crimes
they
had
committed
.
 
<EOS>
The
terrible
energy
with
which
they
spoke
,
would
have
moved
any
person
,
no
matter
how
good
or
just
(
if
any
good
or
just
person
could
have
strayed
into
that
sad
place
that
night
)
,
to
have
set
them
at
liberty
:
and
,
while
he
would
have
left
any
other
punishment
to
its
free
course
,
to
have
saved
them
from
this
last
dreadful
and
repulsive
penalty
;
which
never
turned
a
man
inclined
to
evil
,
and
has
hardened
thousands
who
were
half
inclined
to
good
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dennis
,
who
had
been
bred
and
nurtured
in
the
good
old
school
,
and
had
administered
the
good
old
laws
on
the
good
old
plan
,
always
once
and
sometimes
twice
every
six
weeks
,
for
a
long
time
,
bore
these
appeals
with
a
deal
of
philosophy
.
 
<EOS>
Being
at
last
,
however
,
rather
disturbed
in
his
pleasant
reflection
by
their
repetition
,
he
rapped
at
one
of
the
doors
with
his
stick
,
and
cried
:
  
"
Hold
your
noise
there
<EOS>
,
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
At
this
they
all
cried
together
that
they
were
to
be
hanged
on
the
next
day
but
one
;
and
again
implored
his
aid
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aid
!
<EOS>
For
what
!
"
said
Mr
Dennis
,
playfully
rapping
the
knuckles
of
the
hand
nearest
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
save
us
!
"
<EOS>
they
cried
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
certainly
,
"
said
Mr
Dennis
,
winking
at
the
wall
in
the
absence
of
any
friend
with
whom
he
could
humour
the
joke
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
you
're
to
be
worked
off
,
are
you
,
brothers
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Unless
we
are
released
to
-
night
,
"
one
of
them
cried
,
"
we
are
dead
men
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
what
it
is
,
"
said
the
hangman
,
gravely
;
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid
,
my
friend
,
that
you
're
not
in
that
'
ere
state
of
mind
that
's
suitable
to
your
condition
,
then
;
you
're
not
a
-
going
to
be
released
:
do
n't
think
it
---
<EOS>
Will
you
leave
off
that
'
ere
indecent
row
?
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
you
an't
ashamed
of
yourselves
,
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
followed
up
this
reproof
by
rapping
every
set
of
knuckles
one
after
the
other
,
and
having
done
so
,
resumed
his
seat
again
with
a
cheerful
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
've
had
law
,
"
he
said
,
crossing
his
legs
and
elevating
his
eyebrows
:
"
laws
have
been
made
a
"
purpose
for
you
;
a
wery
handsome
prison
's
been
made
a
"
purpose
for
you
;
a
parson
's
kept
a
purpose
for
you
;
a
constitootional
officer
's
appointed
a
"
purpose
for
you
;
carts
is
maintained
a
"
purpose
for
you
---
and
yet
you
're
not
contented
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
WILL
you
hold
that
noise
,
you
sir
in
the
furthest
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
A
groan
was
the
only
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
well
as
I
can
make
out
,
"
said
Mr
Dennis
,
in
a
tone
of
mingled
badinage
and
remonstrance
,
"
there
's
not
a
man
among
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
begin
to
think
I
'm
on
the
opposite
side
,
and
<EOS>
among
the
ladies
;
though
for
the
matter
of
that
,
I
've
seen
a
many
ladies
face
it
out
,
in
a
manner
that
did
honour
to
the
sex
.
<EOS>
---
You
in
number
two
,
do
n't
grind
them
teeth
of
yours
.
 
<EOS>
Worse
manners
,
"
said
the
hangman
,
rapping
at
the
door
with
his
stick
,
"
I
never
see
in
this
place
afore
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
ashamed
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
a
disgrace
to
the
Bailey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
After
pausing
for
a
moment
to
hear
if
anything
could
be
pleaded
in
justification
,
Mr
Dennis
resumed
in
a
sort
of
coaxing
tone
:
  
"
<EOS>
Now
look'ee
here
,
you
four
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
come
here
to
take
care
of
you
,
and
see
that
you
an't
burnt
,
instead
of
the
other
thing
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
no
use
<EOS>
your
making
any
noise
,
for
you
wo
n't
be
found
out
by
them
as
has
broken
in
,
and
you
'll
only
be
hoarse
when
you
come
to
the
speeches
,
---
which
is
a
pity
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
say
in
respect
to
the
speeches
always
is
,
"
Give
it
mouth
.
"
 
<EOS>
That
's
my
maxim
.
 
<EOS>
Give
it
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
heerd
,
"
said
the
hangman
,
pulling
off
his
hat
to
take
his
handkerchief
from
the
crown
and
wipe
his
face
,
and
then
putting
it
on
again
a
little
more
on
one
side
than
before
,
"
I
've
heerd
a
eloquence
on
them
boards
---
you
know
what
boards
<EOS>
I
mean
---
and
have
heerd
a
degree
of
mouth
given
to
them
speeches
,
that
they
was
as
clear
as
a
bell
,
and
as
good
as
a
play
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
a
pattern
!
 
<EOS>
And
always
,
when
a
thing
of
this
natur
's
to
come
off
,
what
I
stand
up
for
,
is
,
a
proper
frame
of
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Let
's
have
a
proper
frame
of
mind
,
and
we
can
go
through
with
it
,
creditable
---
pleasant
---
 
sociable
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
you
do
<EOS>
(
and
I
address
myself
in
particular
,
to
you
in
the
furthest
)
,
never
snivel
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
sooner
by
half
,
though
I
lose
by
it
,
see
a
man
tear
his
clothes
a
"
purpose
to
spile
'em
before
they
come
to
me
,
than
find
him
snivelling
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
ten
to
one
a
better
frame
of
mind
,
every
way
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
While
the
hangman
addressed
them
to
this
effect
,
in
the
tone
and
with
the
air
of
a
pastor
in
familiar
conversation
with
his
flock
,
the
noise
had
been
in
some
degree
subdued
;
for
the
rioters
were
busy
in
conveying
the
prisoners
to
the
Sessions
House
,
which
was
beyond
the
main
walls
of
the
prison
,
though
connected
with
it
,
and
the
crowd
were
busy
too
,
in
passing
them
from
thence
along
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
he
had
got
thus
far
in
his
discourse
,
the
sound
of
voices
in
the
yard
showed
plainly
that
the
mob
had
returned
and
were
coming
that
way
;
and
directly
afterwards
a
violent
crashing
at
the
grate
below
,
gave
note
of
their
attack
upon
the
cells
(
as
they
were
called
)
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
the
hangman
ran
from
door
to
door
,
and
covered
the
grates
,
one
after
another
,
with
his
hat
,
in
futile
efforts
to
stifle
the
cries
of
the
four
men
within
;
it
was
in
vain
he
dogged
their
outstretched
hands
,
and
beat
them
with
his
stick
,
or
menaced
them
with
new
and
lingering
pains
in
the
execution
of
his
office
;
the
place
resounded
with
their
cries
.
 
<EOS>
These
,
together
with
the
feeling
that
they
were
now
the
last
men
in
the
jail
,
so
worked
upon
and
stimulated
the
besiegers
,
that
in
an
incredibly
short
space
of
time
they
forced
the
strong
grate
down
below
,
which
was
formed
of
iron
rods
two
inches
square
,
drove
in
the
two
other
doors
,
as
if
they
had
been
but
deal
partitions
,
and
stood
at
the
end
of
the
gallery
with
only
a
bar
or
two
between
them
and
the
cells
.
  
<EOS>
"
Halloa
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Hugh
,
who
was
the
first
to
look
into
the
dusky
passage
:
"
<EOS>
Dennis
before
us
!
 
<EOS>
Well
done
,
old
boy
.
 
<EOS>
Be
quick
,
and
open
here
,
for
we
shall
be
suffocated
in
the
smoke
,
going
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Go
out
at
once
,
then
,
"
said
Dennis
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Want
!
"
echoed
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
four
men
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Four
devils
!
"
cried
the
hangman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
know
they
're
left
for
death
on
Thursday
?
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
respect
the
law
---
the
constitootion
---
 
nothing
?
 
<EOS>
Let
the
four
men
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
this
a
time
for
joking
?
"
cried
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
hear
'em
?
 
<EOS>
Pull
away
these
bars
that
have
got
fixed
between
the
door
and
the
ground
;
and
let
us
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Brother
,
"
said
the
hangman
,
in
a
low
voice
,
as
he
stooped
under
pretence
of
doing
what
Hugh
desired
,
but
only
looked
up
in
his
face
,
"
ca
n't
you
leave
these
here
four
men
to
me
,
if
I
've
the
whim
!
<EOS>
You
do
what
you
like
,
and
have
what
you
like
of
everything
for
your
share
,
---
give
me
my
share
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
these
four
men
left
alone
,
I
tell
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pull
the
bars
down
,
or
stand
out
of
the
way
,
"
was
Hugh
's
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
turn
the
crowd
if
you
like
<EOS>
,
you
know
that
well
enough
,
brother
,
"
said
the
hangman
,
slowly
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
 
<EOS>
You
WILL
come
in
,
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
let
these
men
alone
,
and
leave
'em
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
You
've
no
respect
for
nothing
---
have
n't
you
?
"
said
the
hangman
,
retreating
to
the
door
by
which
he
had
entered
,
and
regarding
his
companion
with
a
scowl
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
WILL
come
in
,
will
you
,
brother
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
yes
.
 
<EOS>
What
the
devil
ails
you
?
 
<EOS>
Where
are
you
going
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
matter
where
I
'm
going
,
"
rejoined
the
hangman
,
looking
in
again
at
the
iron
wicket
,
which
he
had
nearly
shut
upon
himself
,
and
held
ajar
.
 
<EOS>
"
Remember
where
you
're
coming
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
all
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
,
he
shook
his
likeness
at
Hugh
,
and
giving
him
a
grin
,
compared
with
which
his
usual
smile
was
amiable
,
disappeared
,
and
shut
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
Hugh
paused
no
longer
,
but
goaded
alike
by
the
cries
of
the
convicts
,
and
by
the
impatience
of
the
crowd
,
warned
the
man
immediately
behind
him
---
the
way
was
only
wide
enough
for
one
abreast
---
to
stand
back
,
and
wielded
a
sledge
-
hammer
with
such
strength
,
that
after
a
few
blows
the
iron
bent
and
broke
,
and
gave
them
free
admittance
.
  
<EOS>
It
the
two
sons
of
one
of
these
men
,
of
whom
mention
has
been
made
,
were
furious
in
their
zeal
before
,
they
had
now
the
wrath
and
vigour
of
lions
.
 
<EOS>
Calling
to
the
man
within
each
cell
,
to
keep
as
far
back
as
he
could
,
lest
the
axes
crashing
through
the
door
should
wound
him
,
a
party
went
to
work
upon
each
one
,
to
beat
it
in
by
sheer
strength
,
and
force
the
bolts
and
staples
from
their
hold
.
<EOS>
But
although
these
two
lads
had
the
weakest
party
,
and
the
worst
armed
,
and
did
not
begin
until
after
the
others
,
having
stopped
to
whisper
to
him
through
the
grate
,
that
door
was
the
first
open
,
and
that
man
was
the
first
out
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
dragged
him
into
the
gallery
to
knock
off
his
irons
,
he
fell
down
among
them
,
a
mere
heap
of
chains
,
and
was
carried
out
in
that
state
on
men
's
shoulders
,
with
no
sign
of
life
.
  
<EOS>
The
release
of
these
four
wretched
creatures
,
and
conveying
them
,
astounded
and
bewildered
,
into
the
streets
so
full
of
life
---
a
spectacle
they
had
never
thought
to
see
again
,
until
they
emerged
from
solitude
and
silence
upon
that
last
journey
,
when
the
air
should
be
heavy
with
the
pent
-
up
breath
of
thousands
,
and
the
streets
and
houses
should
be
built
and
roofed
with
human
faces
,
not
with
bricks
and
tiles
and
stones
---
was
the
crowning
horror
of
the
scene
.
 
<EOS>
Their
pale
and
haggard
looks
and
hollow
eyes
;
<EOS>
their
staggering
feet
,
and
hands
stretched
out
as
if
to
save
themselves
from
falling
;
their
wandering
and
uncertain
air
;
the
way
they
heaved
and
gasped
for
breath
,
as
though
in
water
,
when
they
were
first
plunged
into
the
crowd
;
all
marked
them
for
the
men
.
 
<EOS>
No
need
to
say
"
this
one
was
doomed
to
die
;
"
for
there
were
the
words
broadly
stamped
and
branded
on
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
The
crowd
fell
off
,
as
if
they
had
been
laid
out
for
burial
,
and
had
risen
in
their
shrouds
;
and
many
were
seen
to
shudder
,
as
though
they
had
been
actually
dead
men
,
when
they
chanced
to
touch
or
brush
against
their
garments
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
bidding
of
the
mob
,
the
houses
were
all
illuminated
that
night
---
lighted
up
from
top
to
bottom
as
at
a
time
of
public
gaiety
and
joy
.
 
<EOS>
Many
years
afterwards
,
old
people
who
lived
in
their
youth
near
this
part
of
the
city
,
remembered
being
in
a
great
glare
of
light
,
within
doors
and
without
,
and
as
they
looked
,
timid
and
frightened
children
,
from
the
windows
,
seeing
a
FACE
go
by
.
 
<EOS>
Though
the
whole
great
crowd
and
all
its
other
terrors
had
faded
from
their
recollection
,
this
one
object
remained
;
alone
,
distinct
,
and
well
remembered
.
 
<EOS>
Even
in
the
unpractised
minds
of
infants
,
one
of
these
doomed
men
darting
past
,
and
<EOS>
but
an
instant
seen
,
was
an
image
of
force
enough
to
dim
the
whole
concourse
;
to
find
itself
an
all
-
absorbing
place
,
and
hold
it
ever
after
.
  
<EOS>
When
this
last
task
had
been
achieved
,
the
shouts
and
cries
grew
fainter
;
the
clank
of
fetters
,
which
had
resounded
on
all
sides
as
the
prisoners
escaped
,
was
heard
no
more
;
all
the
noises
of
the
crowd
subsided
into
a
hoarse
and
sullen
murmur
as
it
passed
into
the
distance
;
and
when
the
human
tide
had
rolled
away
,
a
melancholy
heap
of
smoking
ruins
marked
the
spot
where
it
had
lately
chafed
and
roared
.

Chapter
66
    
<EOS>
Although
he
had
had
no
rest
upon
the
previous
night
,
and
had
watched
with
little
intermission
for
some
weeks
past
,
sleeping
only
in
the
day
by
starts
and
snatches
,
Mr
Haredale
,
from
the
dawn
of
morning
until
sunset
,
sought
his
niece
in
every
place
where
he
deemed
it
possible
<EOS>
she
could
have
taken
refuge
.
 
<EOS>
All
day
long
,
nothing
,
save
a
draught
of
water
,
passed
his
lips
;
though
he
prosecuted
his
inquiries
far
and
wide
,
and
never
so
much
as
sat
down
,
once
.
  
<EOS>
In
every
quarter
he
could
think
of
;
at
Chigwell
and
in
London
;
at
the
houses
of
the
tradespeople
with
whom
he
dealt
,
and
of
the
friends
he
knew
;
he
pursued
his
search
.
 
<EOS>
A
prey
to
the
most
harrowing
anxieties
and
apprehensions
,
he
went
from
magistrate
to
magistrate
,
and
finally
to
the
Secretary
of
State
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
comfort
he
received
was
from
this
minister
,
who
assured
him
that
the
Government
,
being
now
driven
to
the
exercise
of
the
extreme
prerogatives
of
the
Crown
,
were
determined
to
exert
them
;
that
a
proclamation
would
probably
be
out
upon
the
morrow
,
giving
to
the
military
,
discretionary
and
unlimited
power
in
the
suppression
of
the
riots
;
that
the
sympathies
of
the
King
,
the
Administration
,
and
both
Houses
of
Parliament
,
and
indeed
of
all
good
men
of
every
religious
persuasion
,
were
strongly
with
the
injured
Catholics
;
and
that
justice
should
be
done
them
at
any
cost
or
hazard
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
him
,
moreover
,
that
other
persons
whose
houses
had
been
burnt
,
had
for
a
time
lost
sight
of
their
children
or
their
relatives
,
but
had
,
in
every
case
,
within
his
knowledge
,
succeeded
in
discovering
them
;
that
his
complaint
should
be
remembered
,
and
fully
stated
in
the
instructions
given
to
the
officers
in
command
,
and
to
all
the
inferior
myrmidons
of
justice
;
and
that
everything
that
could
be
done
to
help
him
,
should
be
done
,
with
a
goodwill
and
in
good
faith
.
  
<EOS>
Grateful
for
this
consolation
,
feeble
as
it
was
in
its
reference
to
the
past
,
and
little
hope
as
it
afforded
him
in
connection
with
the
subject
of
distress
which
lay
nearest
to
his
heart
;
and
really
thankful
for
the
interest
the
minister
expressed
,
and
seemed
to
feel
,
in
his
condition
;
Mr
Haredale
withdrew
.
 
<EOS>
He
found
himself
,
with
the
night
coming
on
,
alone
in
the
streets
;
and
destitute
of
any
place
in
which
to
lay
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
He
entered
an
hotel
near
Charing
Cross
,
and
ordered
some
refreshment
and
a
bed
.
 
<EOS>
He
saw
that
his
faint
and
worn
appearance
attracted
the
attention
of
the
landlord
and
his
waiters
;
and
thinking
that
they
might
suppose
him
to
be
penniless
,
took
out
his
purse
,
and
laid
it
on
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
that
,
the
landlord
said
,
in
a
faltering
voice
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
were
one
of
those
who
had
suffered
by
the
rioters
,
he
durst
not
give
him
entertainment
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
family
of
children
,
and
had
been
twice
warned
to
be
careful
in
receiving
guests
.
 
<EOS>
He
heartily
prayed
his
forgiveness
,
but
what
could
he
do
?
  
<EOS>
Nothing
.
 
<EOS>
No
man
felt
that
more
sincerely
than
Mr
Haredale
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
the
man
as
much
,
and
left
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Feeling
that
he
might
have
anticipated
this
occurrence
,
after
what
he
had
seen
at
Chigwell
in
the
morning
,
where
no
man
dared
to
touch
a
spade
,
though
he
offered
a
large
reward
to
all
who
would
come
and
dig
among
the
ruins
of
his
house
,
he
walked
along
the
Strand
;
too
proud
to
expose
himself
to
another
refusal
,
and
of
too
generous
a
spirit
to
involve
in
distress
or
ruin
any
honest
tradesman
who
might
be
weak
enough
to
give
him
shelter
.
 
<EOS>
He
wandered
into
one
of
the
streets
by
the
side
of
the
river
,
and
was
pacing
in
a
thoughtful
manner
up
and
down
,
thinking
of
things
that
had
happened
long
ago
,
when
he
heard
a
servant
-
man
at
an
upper
window
call
to
another
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
,
that
the
mob
were
setting
fire
to
Newgate
.
  
<EOS>
To
Newgate
!
<EOS>
where
that
man
was
!
 
<EOS>
His
failing
strength
returned
,
his
energies
came
back
with
tenfold
vigour
,
on
the
instant
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
were
possible
---
if
they
should
set
the
murderer
free
---
was
he
,
after
all
he
had
undergone
,
to
die
with
the
suspicion
of
having
slain
his
own
brother
,
dimly
gathering
about
him
---
   
<EOS>
He
had
no
consciousness
of
going
to
the
jail
;
but
there
he
stood
,
before
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
the
crowd
wedged
and
pressed
together
in
a
dense
,
dark
,
moving
mass
;
and
there
were
the
flames
soaring
up
into
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
His
head
turned
round
and
round
,
lights
flashed
before
his
eyes
,
and
he
struggled
hard
with
two
men
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
nay
,
"
said
one
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
more
yourself
,
my
good
sir
.
 
<EOS>
We
attract
attention
here
.
 
<EOS>
Come
away
.
 
<EOS>
What
can
you
do
among
so
many
men
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
gentleman
's
always
for
doing
something
,
"
said
the
other
,
forcing
him
along
as
he
spoke
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
like
him
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
like
him
for
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
had
by
this
time
got
him
into
a
court
,
hard
by
the
prison
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
from
one
to
the
other
,
and
as
he
tried
to
release
himself
,
felt
that
he
tottered
on
his
feet
.
 
<EOS>
He
who
had
spoken
first
,
was
the
old
gentleman
whom
he
had
seen
at
the
Lord
Mayor
's
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
was
John
Grueby
,
who
had
stood
by
him
so
manfully
at
Westminster
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
does
this
mean
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
them
faintly
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
came
we
together
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
the
skirts
of
the
crowd
,
"
returned
the
distiller
;
"
but
come
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
come
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
You
seem
to
know
my
friend
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Surely
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
looking
in
a
kind
of
stupor
at
John
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
'll
tell
you
then
,
"
returned
the
old
gentleman
,
"
that
I
am
a
man
to
be
trusted
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
my
servant
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
lately
(
as
you
know
<EOS>
,
I
have
no
doubt
)
in
Lord
George
Gordon
's
service
;
but
he
left
it
,
and
brought
,
in
pure
goodwill
to
me
and
others
,
who
are
marked
by
the
rioters
,
such
intelligence
as
he
had
picked
up
,
of
their
designs
.
<EOS>
"
   
---
"
On
one
condition
,
please
,
sir
,
"
said
John
,
touching
his
hat
.
 
<EOS>
No
evidence
against
my
lord
---
a
misled
man
---
a
kind
-
hearted
man
,
sir
.
<EOS>
My
lord
never
intended
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
condition
will
be
observed
,
of
course
,
"
rejoined
the
old
distiller
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
point
of
honour
.
 
<EOS>
But
come
with
us
,
sir
;
pray
come
with
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
John
Grueby
added
no
entreaties
,
but
he
adopted
a
different
kind
of
persuasion
,
by
putting
his
arm
through
one
of
Mr
Haredale
's
,
while
his
master
took
the
other
,
and
leading
him
away
with
all
speed
.
  
<EOS>
Sensible
,
from
a
strange
lightness
in
his
head
,
and
a
difficulty
in
fixing
his
thoughts
on
anything
,
even
to
the
extent
of
bearing
his
companions
in
his
mind
for
a
minute
together
without
looking
at
them
,
that
his
brain
was
affected
by
the
agitation
and
suffering
through
which
he
had
passed
,
and
to
which
he
was
still
a
prey
<EOS>
,
Mr
Haredale
let
them
lead
him
where
they
would
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
went
along
,
he
was
conscious
of
having
no
command
over
what
he
said
or
thought
,
and
that
he
had
a
fear
of
going
mad
.
  
<EOS>
The
distiller
lived
,
as
he
had
told
him
when
they
first
met
,
on
Holborn
Hill
,
where
he
had
great
storehouses
and
drove
a
large
trade
.
 
<EOS>
They
approached
his
house
by
a
back
entrance
,
lest
they
should
attract
the
notice
of
the
crowd
,
and
went
into
an
upper
room
which
faced
towards
the
street
;
the
windows
,
however
,
in
common
with
those
of
every
other
room
in
the
house
,
were
boarded
up
inside
,
in
order
that
,
out
of
doors
,
all
might
appear
quite
dark
.
  
<EOS>
They
laid
him
on
a
sofa
in
this
chamber
,
perfectly
insensible
;
but
John
immediately
fetching
a
surgeon
,
who
took
from
him
a
large
quantity
of
blood
,
he
gradually
came
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
was
,
for
the
time
,
too
weak
to
walk
,
they
had
no
difficulty
in
persuading
him
to
remain
there
all
night
,
and
got
him
to
bed
without
loss
of
a
minute
.
 
<EOS>
That
done
,
they
gave
him
cordial
and
some
toast
,
and
presently
a
pretty
strong
composing
-
draught
,
under
the
influence
of
which
he
soon
fell
into
a
lethargy
,
and
,
for
a
time
,
forgot
his
troubles
.
  
<EOS>
The
vintner
,
who
was
a
very
hearty
old
fellow
and
a
worthy
man
,
had
no
thoughts
of
going
to
bed
himself
,
for
he
had
received
several
threatening
warnings
from
the
rioters
,
and
had
indeed
gone
out
that
evening
to
try
and
gather
from
the
conversation
of
the
mob
whether
his
house
was
to
be
the
next
attacked
.
 
<EOS>
He
sat
all
night
in
an
easy
-
chair
in
the
same
room
---
dozing
a
little
now
and
then
---
and
received
from
time
to
time
the
reports
of
John
Grueby
and
two
or
three
other
trustworthy
persons
in
his
employ
,
who
went
out
into
the
streets
as
scouts
;
and
for
whose
entertainment
an
ample
allowance
of
good
cheer
(
which
the
old
vintner
,
despite
his
anxiety
,
now
and
then
attacked
himself
)
was
set
forth
in
an
adjoining
chamber
.
  
<EOS>
These
accounts
were
of
a
sufficiently
alarming
nature
from
the
first
;
but
as
the
night
wore
on
,
they
grew
so
much
worse
,
and
involved
such
a
fearful
amount
of
riot
and
destruction
,
that
in
comparison
with
these
new
tidings
all
the
previous
disturbances
sunk
to
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
intelligence
that
came
,
was
of
the
taking
of
Newgate
,
and
the
escape
of
all
the
prisoners
,
whose
track
,
as
they
made
up
Holborn
and
into
the
adjacent
streets
,
was
proclaimed
to
those
citizens
who
were
shut
up
in
their
houses
,
by
the
rattling
of
their
chains
,
which
formed
a
dismal
concert
,
and
was
heard
in
every
direction
,
as
though
so
many
forges
were
at
work
.
 
<EOS>
The
flames
too
,
shone
so
brightly
through
the
vintner
's
skylights
,
that
the
rooms
and
staircases
below
were
nearly
as
light
as
in
broad
day
;
while
the
distant
shouting
of
the
mob
seemed
to
shake
the
very
walls
and
ceilings
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
they
were
heard
approaching
the
house
,
and
some
minutes
of
terrible
anxiety
ensued
.
 
<EOS>
They
came
close
up
,
and
stopped
before
it
;
but
after
giving
three
loud
yells
,
went
on
.
 
<EOS>
And
although
they
returned
several
times
that
night
,
creating
new
alarms
each
time
,
they
did
nothing
there
;
having
their
hands
full
.
 
<EOS>
Shortly
after
they
had
gone
away
for
the
first
time
,
one
of
the
scouts
came
running
in
with
the
news
that
they
had
stopped
before
Lord
Mansfield
's
house
in
Bloomsbury
Square
.
  
<EOS>
Soon
afterwards
there
came
another
,
and
another
,
and
then
the
first
returned
again
,
and
<EOS>
so
,
by
little
and
little
,
their
tale
was
this
:
---
 
<EOS>
That
the
mob
gathering
round
Lord
Mansfield
's
house
,
had
called
on
those
within
to
open
the
door
,
and
receiving
no
reply
(
for
Lord
and
Lady
Mansfield
were
at
that
moment
escaping
by
the
backway
)
,
forced
an
entrance
according
to
their
usual
custom
.
 
<EOS>
That
they
then
began
to
demolish
the
house
with
great
fury
,
and
setting
fire
to
it
in
several
parts
,
involved
in
a
common
ruin
the
whole
of
the
costly
furniture
,
the
plate
and
jewels
,
a
beautiful
gallery
of
pictures
,
the
rarest
collection
of
manuscripts
ever
possessed
by
any
one
private
person
in
the
world
,
and
worse
than
all
,
because
nothing
could
replace
this
loss
,
the
great
Law
Library
,
on
almost
every
page
of
which
were
notes
in
the
Judge
's
own
hand
,
of
inestimable
value
,
---
being
the
results
of
the
study
and
experience
of
his
whole
life
.
 
<EOS>
That
while
they
were
howling
and
exulting
round
the
fire
,
a
troop
of
soldiers
,
with
a
magistrate
among
them
,
came
up
,
and
being
too
late
(
for
the
mischief
<EOS>
was
by
that
time
done
)
,
began
to
disperse
the
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
That
the
Riot
Act
being
read
,
and
the
crowd
still
resisting
,
the
soldiers
received
orders
to
fire
,
and
levelling
their
muskets
shot
dead
at
the
first
discharge
six
men
and
a
woman
,
and
wounded
many
persons
;
and
loading
again
directly
,
fired
another
volley
,
but
over
the
people
's
heads
it
was
supposed
,
as
none
were
seen
to
fall
.
 
<EOS>
That
thereupon
,
and
daunted
by
the
shrieks
and
tumult
,
the
crowd
began
to
disperse
,
and
the
soldiers
went
away
,
leaving
the
killed
and
wounded
on
the
ground
:
which
they
had
no
sooner
done
than
the
rioters
came
back
again
,
and
taking
up
the
dead
bodies
,
and
the
wounded
people
,
formed
into
a
rude
procession
,
having
the
bodies
in
the
front
.
 
<EOS>
That
in
this
order
they
paraded
off
with
a
horrible
merriment
;
fixing
weapons
in
the
dead
men
's
hands
to
make
them
look
as
if
alive
;
and
preceded
by
a
fellow
ringing
Lord
Mansfield
's
dinner
-
bell
with
all
his
might
.
  
<EOS>
The
scouts
reported
further
,
that
this
party
meeting
with
some
others
who
had
been
at
similar
work
elsewhere
,
they
all
united
into
one
,
and
drafting
off
a
few
men
with
the
killed
and
wounded
,
marched
away
to
Lord
Mansfield
's
country
seat
at
Caen
Wood
,
between
Hampstead
and
Highgate
;
bent
upon
destroying
that
house
likewise
,
and
lighting
up
a
great
fire
there
,
which
from
that
height
should
be
seen
all
over
London
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
this
,
they
were
disappointed
,
for
a
party
of
horse
having
arrived
before
them
,
they
retreated
faster
than
they
went
,
and
came
straight
back
to
town
.
  
<EOS>
There
being
now
a
great
many
parties
in
the
streets
,
each
went
to
work
according
to
its
humour
,
and
a
dozen
houses
were
quickly
blazing
,
including
those
of
Sir
John
Fielding
and
two
other
justices
,
and
four
in
Holborn
---
one
of
the
greatest
thoroughfares
in
London
---
which
were
all
burning
at
the
same
time
,
and
burned
until
they
went
out
of
themselves
,
for
the
people
cut
the
engine
hose
,
and
would
not
suffer
the
firemen
to
play
upon
the
flames
.
 
<EOS>
At
one
house
near
Moorfields
,
they
found
in
one
of
the
rooms
some
canary
birds
in
cages
,
and
these
they
cast
into
the
fire
alive
.
 
<EOS>
The
poor
little
creatures
screamed
,
it
was
said
,
like
infants
,
when
they
were
flung
upon
the
blaze
;
and
one
man
was
so
touched
that
he
tried
in
vain
to
save
them
,
which
roused
the
indignation
of
the
crowd
,
and
nearly
cost
him
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
At
this
same
house
,
one
of
the
fellows
who
went
through
the
rooms
,
breaking
the
furniture
and
helping
to
destroy
the
building
,
found
a
child
's
doll
---
a
poor
toy
---
which
he
exhibited
at
the
window
to
the
mob
below
,
as
the
image
of
some
unholy
saint
which
the
late
occupants
had
worshipped
.
 
<EOS>
While
he
was
doing
this
,
another
man
with
an
equally
tender
conscience
(
they
had
both
been
foremost
in
throwing
down
the
canary
birds
for
roasting
alive
)
,
took
his
seat
on
the
parapet
of
the
house
,
and
harangued
the
crowd
from
a
pamphlet
circulated
by
the
Association
,
relative
to
the
true
principles
of
Christianity
!
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
the
Lord
Mayor
,
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
looked
on
as
an
idle
man
might
look
at
any
other
show
,
and
seemed
mightily
satisfied
to
have
got
a
good
place
.
  
<EOS>
Such
were
the
accounts
brought
to
the
old
vintner
by
his
servants
as
he
sat
at
the
side
of
Mr
Haredale
's
bed
,
having
been
unable
even
to
doze
,
after
the
first
part
of
the
night
;
too
much
disturbed
by
his
own
fears
;
by
the
cries
of
the
mob
,
the
light
of
the
fires
,
and
the
firing
of
the
soldiers
.
 
<EOS>
Such
,
with
the
addition
of
the
release
of
all
the
prisoners
in
the
New
Jail
at
Clerkenwell
,
and
as
many
robberies
of
passengers
in
the
streets
,
as
the
crowd
had
leisure
to
indulge
in
,
were
the
scenes
of
which
Mr
Haredale
was
happily
unconscious
,
and
which
were
all
enacted
before
midnight
.

Chapter
67
    
<EOS>
When
darkness
broke
away
and
morning
began
to
dawn
,
the
town
wore
a
strange
aspect
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
Sleep
had
hardly
been
thought
of
all
night
.
 
<EOS>
The
general
alarm
was
so
apparent
in
the
faces
of
the
inhabitants
,
and
its
expression
was
so
aggravated
by
want
of
rest
(
few
persons
,
with
any
property
to
lose
,
having
dared
go
to
bed
since
Monday
)
,
that
a
stranger
coming
into
the
streets
would
have
supposed
some
mortal
pest
or
plague
to
have
been
raging
.
 
<EOS>
In
place
of
the
usual
cheerfulness
and
animation
of
morning
,
everything
was
dead
and
silent
.
 
<EOS>
The
shops
remained
closed
,
offices
and
warehouses
were
shut
,
the
coach
and
chair
stands
were
deserted
,
no
carts
or
waggons
rumbled
through
the
slowly
waking
streets
,
the
early
cries
were
all
hushed
;
a
universal
gloom
prevailed
.
 
<EOS>
Great
numbers
of
people
were
out
,
even
at
daybreak
,
but
they
flitted
to
and
fro
as
though
they
shrank
from
the
sound
of
their
own
footsteps
;
the
public
ways
were
haunted
rather
than
frequented
;
and
round
the
smoking
ruins
people
stood
apart
from
one
another
and
in
silence
,
not
venturing
to
condemn
the
rioters
,
or
to
be
supposed
to
do
so
,
even
in
whispers
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
Lord
President
's
in
Piccadilly
,
at
Lambeth
Palace
,
at
the
Lord
Chancellor
's
in
Great
Ormond
Street
,
in
the
Royal
Exchange
,
the
Bank
,
the
Guildhall
,
the
Inns
of
Court
,
the
Courts
of
Law
,
and
every
chamber
fronting
the
streets
near
Westminster
Hall
and
the
Houses
of
Parliament
,
parties
of
soldiers
were
posted
before
daylight
.
 
<EOS>
A
body
of
Horse
Guards
paraded
Palace
Yard
;
an
encampment
was
formed
in
the
Park
,
where
fifteen
hundred
men
and
five
battalions
of
Militia
were
under
arms
;
the
Tower
was
fortified
,
the
drawbridges
were
raised
,
the
cannon
loaded
and
pointed
,
and
two
regiments
of
artillery
busied
in
strengthening
the
fortress
and
preparing
it
for
defence
.
 
<EOS>
A
numerous
detachment
of
soldiers
were
stationed
to
keep
guard
at
the
New
River
Head
,
which
the
people
had
threatened
to
attack
,
and
where
,
it
was
said
,
they
meant
to
cut
off
the
main
-
pipes
,
so
that
there
might
be
no
water
for
the
extinction
of
the
flames
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
Poultry
,
and
on
Cornhill
,
and
at
several
other
leading
points
,
iron
chains
were
drawn
across
the
street
;
parties
of
soldiers
were
distributed
in
some
of
the
old
city
churches
while
it
was
yet
dark
;
and
in
several
private
houses
(
among
them
,
Lord
Rockingham
's
in
Grosvenor
Square
)
;
which
were
blockaded
as
though
to
sustain
a
siege
,
and
had
guns
pointed
from
the
windows
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
sun
rose
,
it
shone
into
handsome
apartments
filled
with
armed
men
;
the
furniture
hastily
heaped
away
in
corners
,
and
made
of
little
or
no
account
,
in
the
terror
of
the
time
---
on
arms
glittering
in
city
chambers
,
among
desks
and
stools
,
and
dusty
books
---
into
little
smoky
churchyards
in
odd
lanes
and
by
-
ways
,
with
soldiers
lying
down
among
the
tombs
,
or
lounging
under
the
shade
of
the
one
old
tree
,
and
their
pile
of
muskets
sparkling
in
the
light
---
on
solitary
sentries
pacing
up
and
down
in
courtyards
,
silent
now
,
but
yesterday
resounding
with
the
din
and
hum
of
business
---
everywhere
on
guard
-
rooms
,
garrisons
,
and
threatening
preparations
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
day
crept
on
,
still
more
unusual
sights
were
witnessed
in
the
streets
.
 
<EOS>
The
gates
of
the
King
's
Bench
and
Fleet
Prisons
being
opened
at
the
usual
hour
,
were
found
to
have
notices
affixed
to
them
,
announcing
that
the
rioters
would
come
that
night
to
burn
them
down
.
 
<EOS>
The
wardens
,
too
well
knowing
the
likelihood
<EOS>
there
was
of
this
promise
being
fulfilled
,
were
fain
to
set
their
prisoners
at
liberty
,
and
give
them
leave
to
move
their
goods
;
so
,
all
day
,
such
of
them
as
had
any
furniture
were
occupied
in
conveying
it
,
some
to
this
place
,
some
to
that
,
and
not
a
few
to
the
brokers
'
shops
,
where
they
gladly
sold
it
,
for
any
wretched
price
those
gentry
chose
to
give
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
some
broken
men
among
these
debtors
who
had
been
in
jail
so
long
,
and
were
so
miserable
and
destitute
of
friends
,
so
dead
to
the
world
,
and
utterly
forgotten
and
uncared
for
,
that
they
implored
their
jailers
not
to
set
them
free
,
and
to
send
them
,
if
need
were
,
to
some
other
place
of
custody
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
,
refusing
to
comply
,
lest
they
should
incur
the
anger
of
the
mob
,
turned
them
into
the
streets
,
where
they
wandered
up
and
down
hardly
remembering
the
ways
untrodden
by
their
feet
so
long
,
and
crying
---
<EOS>
such
abject
things
those
rotten
-
hearted
jails
had
made
them
---
as
they
slunk
off
in
their
rags
,
and
dragged
their
slipshod
feet
along
the
pavement
.
  
<EOS>
Even
of
the
three
hundred
prisoners
who
had
escaped
from
Newgate
,
there
were
some
---
a
few
,
but
there
were
some
---
who
sought
their
jailers
out
and
delivered
themselves
up
:
preferring
imprisonment
and
punishment
to
the
horrors
of
such
another
night
as
the
last
.
<EOS>
Many
of
the
convicts
,
drawn
back
to
their
old
place
of
captivity
by
some
indescribable
attraction
,
or
by
a
desire
to
exult
over
it
in
its
downfall
and
glut
their
revenge
by
seeing
it
in
ashes
,
actually
went
back
in
broad
noon
,
and
loitered
about
the
cells
.
 
<EOS>
Fifty
were
retaken
at
one
time
on
this
next
day
,
within
the
prison
walls
;
but
their
fate
did
not
deter
others
,
for
there
they
went
in
spite
of
everything
,
and
there
they
were
taken
in
twos
and
threes
,
twice
or
thrice
a
day
,
all
through
the
week
.
 
<EOS>
Of
the
fifty
<EOS>
just
mentioned
,
some
were
occupied
in
endeavouring
to
rekindle
the
fire
;
but
in
general
they
seemed
to
have
no
object
in
view
but
to
prowl
and
lounge
about
the
old
place
:
being
often
found
asleep
in
the
ruins
,
or
sitting
talking
there
,
or
even
eating
and
drinking
,
as
in
a
choice
retreat
.
  
<EOS>
Besides
the
notices
on
the
gates
of
the
Fleet
and
the
King
's
Bench
,
many
similar
announcements
were
left
,
before
one
o'clock
at
noon
,
at
the
houses
of
private
individuals
;
and
further
,
the
mob
proclaimed
their
intention
of
seizing
on
the
Bank
,
the
Mint
,
the
Arsenal
at
Woolwich
,
and
the
Royal
Palaces
.
 
<EOS>
The
notices
were
seldom
delivered
by
more
than
one
man
,
who
,
if
it
were
at
a
shop
,
went
in
,
and
laid
it
,
with
a
bloody
threat
perhaps
,
upon
the
counter
;
or
if
it
were
at
a
private
house
,
knocked
at
the
door
,
and
thrust
it
in
the
servant
's
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
presence
of
the
military
in
every
quarter
of
the
town
,
and
the
great
force
in
the
Park
,
these
messengers
did
their
errands
with
impunity
all
through
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
So
did
two
boys
who
went
down
Holborn
alone
,
armed
with
bars
taken
from
the
railings
of
Lord
Mansfield
's
house
,
and
demanded
money
for
the
rioters
.
 
<EOS>
So
did
a
tall
man
on
horseback
who
made
a
collection
for
the
same
purpose
in
Fleet
Street
,
and
refused
to
take
anything
but
gold
.
  
<EOS>
A
rumour
had
now
got
into
circulation
,
too
,
which
diffused
a
greater
dread
all
through
London
,
even
than
these
publicly
announced
intentions
of
the
rioters
,
though
all
men
knew
that
if
they
were
successfully
effected
,
there
must
ensue
a
national
bankruptcy
and
general
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
said
that
they
meant
to
throw
the
gates
of
Bedlam
open
,
and
let
all
the
madmen
loose
.
 
<EOS>
This
suggested
such
dreadful
images
to
the
people
's
minds
,
and
was
indeed
an
act
so
fraught
with
new
and
unimaginable
horrors
in
the
contemplation
,
that
it
beset
them
more
than
any
loss
or
cruelty
of
which
they
could
foresee
the
worst
,
and
drove
many
sane
men
nearly
mad
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
So
the
day
passed
on
:
the
prisoners
moving
their
goods
;
people
running
to
and
fro
in
the
streets
,
carrying
away
their
property
;
groups
standing
in
silence
round
the
ruins
;
all
business
suspended
;
and
the
soldiers
disposed
as
has
been
already
mentioned
,
remaining
quite
inactive
.
 
<EOS>
So
the
day
passed
on
,
and
dreaded
night
drew
near
again
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
,
at
seven
o'clock
in
the
evening
,
the
Privy
Council
issued
a
solemn
proclamation
that
it
was
now
necessary
to
employ
the
military
,
and
that
the
officers
had
most
direct
and
effectual
orders
,
by
an
immediate
exertion
of
their
utmost
force
,
to
repress
the
disturbances
;
and
warning
all
good
subjects
of
the
King
to
keep
themselves
,
their
servants
,
and
apprentices
,
within
doors
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
then
delivered
out
to
every
soldier
on
duty
,
thirty
-
six
rounds
of
powder
and
ball
;
the
drums
beat
;
and
the
whole
force
was
under
arms
at
sunset
.
  
<EOS>
The
City
authorities
,
stimulated
by
these
vigorous
measures
,
held
a
Common
Council
;
passed
a
vote
thanking
the
military
associations
who
had
tendered
their
aid
to
the
civil
authorities
;
accepted
it
;
and
placed
them
under
the
direction
of
the
two
sheriffs
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
Queen
's
palace
,
a
double
guard
,
the
yeomen
on
duty
,
the
groom
-
porters
,
and
all
other
attendants
,
were
stationed
in
the
passages
and
on
the
staircases
at
seven
o'clock
,
with
strict
instructions
to
be
watchful
on
their
posts
all
night
;
and
all
the
doors
were
locked
.
 
<EOS>
The
gentlemen
of
the
Temple
,
and
the
other
Inns
,
mounted
guard
within
their
gates
,
and
strengthened
them
with
the
great
stones
of
the
pavement
,
which
they
took
up
for
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
In
Lincoln
's
Inn
,
they
gave
up
the
hall
and
commons
to
the
Northumberland
Militia
,
under
the
command
of
Lord
Algernon
Percy
;
in
some
few
of
the
city
wards
,
the
burgesses
turned
out
,
and
without
making
a
very
fierce
show
,
looked
brave
enough
.
 
<EOS>
Some
hundreds
of
stout
gentlemen
threw
themselves
,
armed
to
the
teeth
,
into
the
halls
of
the
different
companies
,
double
-
locked
and
bolted
all
the
gates
,
and
dared
the
rioters
(
among
themselves
)
to
come
on
at
their
peril
.
 
<EOS>
These
arrangements
being
all
made
simultaneously
,
or
nearly
so
,
were
completed
by
the
time
it
got
dark
;
and
then
the
streets
were
comparatively
clear
,
and
were
guarded
at
all
the
great
corners
and
chief
avenues
by
the
troops
:
while
parties
of
the
officers
rode
up
and
down
in
all
directions
,
ordering
chance
stragglers
home
,
and
admonishing
the
residents
to
keep
within
their
houses
,
and
,
if
any
firing
ensued
,
not
to
approach
the
windows
.
<EOS>
More
chains
were
drawn
across
such
of
the
thoroughfares
as
were
of
a
nature
to
favour
the
approach
of
a
great
crowd
,
and
at
each
of
these
points
a
considerable
force
was
stationed
.
 
<EOS>
All
these
precautions
having
been
taken
,
and
it
being
now
quite
dark
,
those
in
command
awaited
the
result
in
some
anxiety
:
and
not
without
a
hope
that
such
vigilant
demonstrations
might
of
themselves
dishearten
the
populace
,
and
prevent
any
new
outrages
.
  
<EOS>
But
in
this
reckoning
they
were
cruelly
mistaken
,
for
in
half
an
hour
,
or
less
,
as
though
the
setting
in
of
night
had
been
their
preconcerted
signal
,
the
rioters
having
previously
,
in
small
parties
,
<EOS>
prevented
the
lighting
of
the
street
lamps
,
rose
like
a
great
sea
;
and
that
in
so
many
places
at
once
,
and
with
such
inconceivable
fury
,
that
those
who
had
the
direction
of
the
troops
knew
not
,
at
first
,
where
to
turn
or
what
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
One
after
another
,
new
fires
blazed
up
in
every
quarter
of
the
town
,
as
though
it
were
the
intention
of
the
insurgents
to
wrap
the
city
in
a
circle
of
flames
,
which
,
contracting
by
degrees
,
should
burn
the
whole
to
ashes
;
the
crowd
swarmed
and
roared
in
every
street
;
and
none
but
rioters
and
soldiers
being
out
of
doors
,
it
seemed
to
the
latter
as
if
all
London
were
arrayed
against
them
,
and
they
stood
alone
against
the
town
.
  
<EOS>
In
two
hours
,
six
-
and
-
thirty
fires
were
raging
---
six
-
and
-
thirty
great
conflagrations
:
among
them
the
Borough
Clink
in
Tooley
Street
,
the
King
's
Bench
,
the
Fleet
,
and
the
New
Bridewell
.
 
<EOS>
In
almost
every
street
,
there
was
a
battle
;
and
in
every
quarter
the
muskets
of
the
troops
were
heard
above
the
shouts
and
tumult
of
the
mob
.
 
<EOS>
The
firing
began
in
the
Poultry
,
where
the
chain
was
drawn
across
the
road
,
where
nearly
a
score
of
people
were
killed
on
the
first
discharge
.
 
<EOS>
Their
bodies
having
been
hastily
carried
into
St
Mildred
's
Church
by
the
soldiers
,
the
latter
fired
again
,
and
following
fast
upon
the
crowd
,
who
began
to
give
way
when
they
saw
the
execution
that
was
done
,
formed
across
Cheapside
,
and
charged
them
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
.
  
<EOS>
The
streets
were
now
a
dreadful
spectacle
.
 
<EOS>
The
shouts
of
the
rabble
,
the
shrieks
of
women
,
the
cries
of
the
wounded
,
and
the
constant
firing
,
formed
a
deafening
and
an
awful
accompaniment
to
the
sights
which
every
corner
presented
.
 
<EOS>
Wherever
the
road
was
obstructed
by
the
chains
,
<EOS>
there
the
fighting
and
the
loss
of
life
were
greatest
;
but
there
was
hot
work
and
bloodshed
in
almost
every
leading
thoroughfare
.
  
<EOS>
At
Holborn
Bridge
,
and
on
Holborn
Hill
,
the
confusion
was
greater
than
in
any
other
part
;
for
the
crowd
that
poured
out
of
the
city
in
two
great
streams
,
one
by
Ludgate
Hill
,
and
one
by
Newgate
Street
,
united
at
that
spot
,
and
formed
a
mass
so
dense
,
that
at
every
volley
the
people
seemed
to
fall
in
heaps
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
place
a
large
detachment
of
soldiery
were
posted
,
who
fired
,
now
up
<EOS>
Fleet
Market
,
now
up
Holborn
,
now
up
<EOS>
Snow
Hill
---
constantly
raking
the
streets
in
each
direction
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
place
too
,
several
large
fires
were
burning
,
so
that
all
the
terrors
of
that
terrible
night
seemed
to
be
concentrated
in
one
spot
.
  
<EOS>
Full
twenty
times
,
the
rioters
,
headed
by
one
man
who
wielded
an
axe
in
his
right
hand
,
and
bestrode
a
brewer
's
horse
of
great
size
and
strength
,
caparisoned
with
fetters
taken
out
of
Newgate
,
which
clanked
and
jingled
as
he
went
,
made
an
attempt
to
force
a
passage
at
this
point
,
and
fire
the
vintner
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
Full
twenty
times
they
were
repulsed
with
loss
of
life
,
and
still
came
back
again
;
and
though
the
fellow
at
their
head
was
marked
and
singled
out
by
all
,
and
was
a
conspicuous
object
as
the
only
rioter
on
horseback
,
not
a
man
could
hit
him
.
 
<EOS>
So
surely
as
the
smoke
cleared
away
,
so
surely
there
was
he
;
calling
hoarsely
to
his
companions
,
brandishing
his
axe
above
his
head
,
and
dashing
on
as
though
he
bore
a
charmed
life
,
and
was
proof
against
ball
and
powder
.
  
<EOS>
This
man
was
Hugh
;
and
in
every
part
of
the
riot
,
he
was
seen
.
 
<EOS>
He
headed
two
attacks
upon
the
Bank
,
helped
to
break
open
the
Toll
-
houses
on
Blackfriars
Bridge
,
and
cast
the
money
into
the
street
:
fired
two
of
the
prisons
with
his
own
hand
:
was
here
,
and
there
,
and
everywhere
---
always
foremost
---
always
active
---
striking
at
the
soldiers
,
cheering
on
the
crowd
,
making
his
horse
's
iron
music
heard
through
all
the
yell
and
uproar
:
but
never
hurt
or
stopped
.
<EOS>
Turn
him
at
one
place
,
and
he
made
a
new
struggle
in
anotlter
;
force
him
to
retreat
at
this
point
,
and
he
advanced
on
that
,
directly
.
 
<EOS>
Driven
from
Holborn
for
the
twentieth
time
,
he
rode
at
the
head
of
a
great
crowd
straight
upon
Saint
Paul
's
,
attacked
a
guard
of
soldiers
who
kept
watch
over
a
body
of
prisoners
within
the
iron
railings
,
forced
them
to
retreat
,
rescued
the
men
they
had
in
custody
,
and
with
this
accession
to
his
party
,
came
back
again
,
mad
with
liquor
and
excitement
,
and
hallooing
them
on
like
a
demon
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
no
easy
task
for
the
most
careful
rider
to
sit
a
horse
in
the
midst
of
such
a
throng
and
tumult
;
but
though
this
madman
rolled
upon
his
back
(
he
had
no
saddle
)
like
a
boat
upon
the
sea
,
he
never
for
an
instant
lost
his
seat
,
or
failed
to
guide
him
where
he
would
.
 
<EOS>
Through
the
very
thickest
of
the
press
,
over
dead
bodies
and
burning
fragments
,
now
on
the
pavement
,
now
in
the
road
,
now
riding
up
a
flight
of
steps
to
make
himself
the
more
conspicuous
to
his
party
,
and
now
forcing
a
passage
through
a
mass
of
human
beings
,
so
closely
squeezed
together
that
it
seemed
as
if
the
edge
of
a
knife
would
scarcely
part
them
,
---
on
he
went
,
as
though
he
could
surmount
all
obstacles
by
the
mere
exercise
of
his
will
.
 
<EOS>
And
perhaps
his
not
being
shot
was
in
some
degree
attributable
to
this
very
circumstance
;
for
his
extreme
audacity
,
and
the
conviction
that
he
must
be
one
of
those
to
whom
the
proclamation
referred
,
inspired
the
soldiers
with
a
desire
to
take
him
alive
,
and
diverted
many
an
aim
which
otherwise
might
have
been
more
near
the
mark
.
  
<EOS>
The
vintner
and
Mr
Haredale
,
unable
to
sit
quietly
listening
to
the
noise
without
seeing
what
went
on
,
had
climbed
to
the
roof
of
the
house
,
and
hiding
behind
a
stack
of
chimneys
,
were
looking
cautiously
down
into
the
street
,
almost
hoping
that
after
so
many
repulses
the
rioters
would
be
foiled
,
when
a
great
shout
proclaimed
that
a
parry
were
coming
round
the
other
way
;
and
the
dismal
jingling
of
those
accursed
fetters
warned
them
next
moment
that
they
too
were
led
by
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
The
soldiers
had
advanced
into
Fleet
Market
and
were
dispersing
the
people
there
;
so
that
they
came
on
with
hardly
any
check
,
and
were
soon
before
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
's
over
now
,
"
said
the
vintner
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fifty
thousand
pounds
will
be
scattered
in
a
minute
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
save
ourselves
.
 
<EOS>
We
can
do
no
more
,
and
shall
have
reason
to
be
thankful
if
we
do
as
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Their
first
impulse
was
,
to
clamber
along
the
roofs
of
the
houses
,
and
,
knocking
at
some
garret
window
for
admission
,
pass
down
that
way
into
the
street
,
and
so
escape
.
 
<EOS>
But
another
fierce
cry
from
below
,
and
a
general
upturning
of
the
faces
of
the
crowd
,
apprised
them
that
they
were
discovered
,
and
even
that
Mr
Haredale
was
recognised
;
for
Hugh
,
seeing
him
plainly
in
the
bright
glare
of
the
fire
,
which
in
that
part
made
it
as
light
as
day
,
called
to
him
by
his
name
,
and
swore
to
have
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
Leave
me
here
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
"
and
in
Heaven
's
name
,
my
good
friend
,
save
yourself
!
 
<EOS>
Come
on
!
"
<EOS>
he
muttered
,
as
he
turned
towards
Hugh
and
faced
him
without
any
further
effort
at
concealment
:
"
This
roof
is
high
,
and
if
we
close
,
we
will
die
together
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Madness
,
"
said
the
honest
vintner
,
pulling
him
back
,
"
sheer
madness
.
 
<EOS>
Hear
reason
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
My
good
sir
,
hear
reason
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
never
make
myself
heard
by
knocking
at
a
window
now
;
and
even
if
I
could
,
no
one
would
be
bold
enough
to
connive
at
my
escape
.
<EOS>
Through
the
cellars
,
there
's
a
kind
of
passage
into
the
back
street
by
which
we
roll
casks
in
and
out
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
have
time
to
get
down
there
before
they
can
force
an
entry
.
 
<EOS>
Do
not
delay
an
instant
,
but
come
with
me
---
for
both
our
sakes
---
for
mine
---
my
dear
good
sir
!
"
  
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
and
drew
Mr
Haredale
back
,
they
had
both
a
glimpse
of
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
but
a
glimpse
,
but
it
showed
them
the
crowd
,
gathering
and
clustering
round
the
house
:
some
of
the
armed
men
pressing
to
the
front
to
break
down
the
doors
and
windows
,
<EOS>
some
bringing
brands
from
the
nearest
fire
,
some
with
lifted
faces
following
their
course
upon
the
roof
and
pointing
them
out
to
their
companions
:
all
raging
and
roaring
like
the
flames
they
lighted
up
.
<EOS>
They
saw
some
men
thirsting
for
the
treasures
of
strong
liquor
which
they
knew
were
stored
within
;
they
saw
others
,
who
had
been
wounded
,
sinking
down
into
the
opposite
doorways
and
dying
,
solitary
wretches
,
in
the
midst
of
all
the
vast
assemblage
;
here
a
frightened
woman
trying
to
escape
;
and
there
a
lost
child
;
and
there
a
drunken
ruffian
,
unconscious
of
the
death
-
wound
on
his
head
,
raving
and
fighting
to
the
last
.
 
<EOS>
All
these
things
,
and
even
such
trivial
incidents
as
a
man
with
his
hat
off
,
or
turning
round
,
or
stooping
down
,
or
shaking
hands
with
another
,
they
marked
distinctly
;
yet
in
a
glance
so
brief
,
that
,
in
the
act
of
stepping
back
,
they
lost
the
whole
,
and
saw
<EOS>
but
the
pale
faces
of
each
other
,
and
the
red
sky
above
them
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
yielded
to
the
entreaties
of
his
companion
---
more
because
he
was
resolved
to
defend
him
,
than
for
any
thought
he
had
of
his
own
life
,
or
any
care
he
entertained
for
his
own
safety
---
and
quickly
re
-
entering
the
house
,
they
descended
the
stairs
together
.
<EOS>
Loud
blows
were
thundering
on
the
shutters
,
crowbars
were
already
thrust
beneath
the
door
,
the
glass
fell
from
the
sashes
,
a
deep
light
shone
through
every
crevice
,
and
they
heard
the
voices
of
the
foremost
in
the
crowd
so
close
to
every
chink
and
keyhole
,
that
they
seemed
to
be
hoarsely
whispering
their
threats
into
their
very
ears
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
<EOS>
but
a
moment
reached
the
bottom
of
the
cellar
-
steps
and
shut
the
door
behind
them
,
when
the
mob
broke
in
.
  
<EOS>
The
vaults
were
profoundly
dark
,
and
having
no
torch
or
candle
---
for
they
had
been
afraid
to
carry
one
,
lest
it
should
betray
their
place
of
refuge
---
they
were
obliged
to
grope
with
their
hands
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
were
not
long
without
light
,
for
they
had
not
gone
far
when
they
heard
the
crowd
forcing
the
door
;
and
,
looking
back
among
the
low
-
arched
passages
,
could
see
them
in
the
distance
,
hurrying
to
and
fro
with
flashing
links
,
broaching
the
casks
,
staving
the
great
vats
,
turning
off
upon
the
right
hand
and
the
left
,
into
the
different
cellars
,
and
lying
down
to
drink
at
the
channels
of
strong
spirits
which
were
already
flowing
on
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
They
hurried
on
,
not
the
less
quickly
for
this
;
and
had
reached
the
only
vault
which
lay
between
them
and
the
passage
out
,
when
suddenly
,
from
the
direction
in
which
they
were
going
,
a
strong
light
gleamed
upon
their
faces
;
and
before
they
could
slip
aside
,
or
turn
back
,
or
hide
themselves
,
two
men
(
one
bearing
a
torch
)
came
upon
them
,
and
cried
in
an
astonished
whisper
,
"
Here
they
are
!
"
  
<EOS>
At
the
same
instant
they
pulled
off
what
they
wore
upon
their
heads
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
saw
before
him
Edward
Chester
,
and
then
saw
,
when
the
vintner
gasped
his
name
,
Joe
Willet
.
  
<EOS>
Ay
,
the
same
Joe
,
though
with
an
arm
the
less
,
who
used
to
make
the
quarterly
journey
on
the
grey
mare
to
pay
the
bill
to
the
purple
-
faced
vintner
;
and
that
very
same
purple
-
faced
vintner
,
formerly
of
Thames
Street
,
now
looked
him
in
the
face
,
and
challenged
him
by
name
.
  
<EOS>
"
Give
me
your
hand
,
"
said
Joe
softly
,
taking
it
whether
the
astonished
vintner
would
or
no
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
fear
to
shake
it
;
it
's
a
friendly
one
and
a
hearty
one
,
though
it
has
no
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
how
well
you
look
and
how
bluff
you
are
!
 
<EOS>
And
you
---
God
bless
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Take
heart
,
take
heart
.
 
<EOS>
We
'll
find
them
.
 
<EOS>
Be
of
good
cheer
;
we
have
not
been
idle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
something
so
honest
and
frank
in
Joe
's
speech
,
that
Mr
Haredale
put
his
hand
in
his
involuntarily
,
though
their
meeting
was
suspicious
enough
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
glance
at
Edward
Chester
,
and
that
gentleman
's
keeping
aloof
,
were
not
lost
upon
Joe
,
who
said
bluntly
,
glancing
at
Edward
while
he
spoke
:
  
<EOS>
"
Times
are
changed
,
Mr
Haredale
,
and
times
have
come
when
we
ought
to
know
friends
from
enemies
,
and
make
no
confusion
of
names
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
tell
you
that
but
for
this
gentleman
,
you
would
most
likely
have
been
dead
by
this
time
,
or
badly
wounded
at
the
best
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
say
?
"
cried
Mr
Haredale
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
said
Joe
,
"
<EOS>
first
,
that
it
was
a
bold
thing
to
be
in
the
crowd
at
all
disguised
as
one
of
them
;
though
I
wo
n't
say
much
about
that
,
on
second
thoughts
,
for
that
's
my
case
too
.
 
<EOS>
Secondly
,
that
it
was
a
brave
and
glorious
action
<EOS>
---
that
's
what
I
call
it
---
to
strike
that
fellow
off
his
horse
before
their
eyes
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
Whose
eyes
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
fellow
,
sir
!
"
cried
Joe
:
"
a
fellow
who
has
no
goodwill
to
you
,
and
who
has
the
daring
and
devilry
in
him
of
twenty
fellows
.
<EOS>
I
know
him
of
old
.
 
<EOS>
Once
in
the
house
,
HE
would
have
found
you
,
here
or
anywhere
.
 
<EOS>
The
rest
owe
you
no
particular
grudge
,
and
,
unless
they
see
you
,
will
only
think
of
drinking
themselves
dead
.
<EOS>
But
we
lose
time
.
 
<EOS>
Are
you
ready
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
,
"
said
Edward
.
 
<EOS>
"
Put
out
the
torch
,
Joe
,
and
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
And
be
silent
,
there
's
a
good
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Silent
or
not
silent
,
"
murmured
Joe
,
as
he
dropped
the
flaring
link
upon
the
ground
,
crushed
it
with
his
foot
,
and
gave
his
hand
to
Mr
Haredale
,
"
it
was
a
brave
and
glorious
action
;
---
no
man
can
alter
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
Both
Mr
Haredale
and
the
worthy
vintner
were
too
amazed
and
too
much
hurried
to
ask
any
further
questions
,
so
followed
their
conductors
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
,
from
a
short
whispering
which
presently
ensued
between
them
and
the
vintner
relative
to
the
best
way
of
escape
,
that
they
had
entered
by
the
back
-
door
,
with
the
connivance
of
John
Grueby
,
who
watched
outside
with
the
key
in
his
pocket
,
and
whom
they
had
taken
into
their
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
A
party
of
the
crowd
coming
up
that
way
,
just
as
they
entered
,
John
had
double
-
locked
the
door
again
,
and
made
off
for
the
soldiers
,
so
that
means
of
retreat
was
cut
off
from
under
them
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
as
the
front
-
door
had
been
forced
,
and
this
minor
crowd
,
being
anxious
to
get
at
the
liquor
,
had
no
fancy
for
losing
time
in
breaking
down
another
,
but
had
gone
round
and
got
in
from
Holborn
with
the
rest
,
the
narrow
lane
in
the
rear
was
quite
free
of
people
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
when
they
had
crawled
through
the
passage
indicated
by
the
vintner
(
which
was
a
mere
shelving
-
trap
for
the
admission
of
casks
)
,
and
had
managed
with
some
difficulty
to
unchain
and
raise
the
door
at
the
upper
end
,
they
emerged
into
the
street
without
being
observed
or
interrupted
.
 
<EOS>
Joe
still
holding
Mr
Haredale
tight
,
and
Edward
taking
the
same
care
of
the
vintner
,
they
hurried
through
the
streets
at
a
rapid
pace
;
occasionally
standing
aside
to
let
some
fugitives
go
by
,
or
to
keep
out
of
the
way
of
the
soldiers
who
followed
them
,
and
whose
questions
,
when
they
halted
to
put
any
,
were
speedily
stopped
by
one
whispered
word
from
Joe
.

Chapter
68
    
<EOS>
While
Newgate
was
burning
on
the
previous
night
,
Barnaby
and
his
father
,
having
been
passed
among
the
crowd
from
hand
to
hand
,
stood
in
Smithfield
,
on
the
outskirts
of
the
mob
,
gazing
at
the
flames
like
men
who
had
been
suddenly
roused
from
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
Some
moments
elapsed
before
they
could
distinctly
remember
where
they
were
,
or
how
they
got
there
;
or
recollected
that
while
they
were
standing
idle
and
listless
spectators
of
the
fire
,
they
had
tools
in
their
hands
which
had
been
hurriedly
given
them
that
they
might
free
themselves
from
their
fetters
.
  
<EOS>
Barnaby
,
heavily
ironed
as
he
was
,
if
he
had
obeyed
his
first
impulse
,
or
if
he
had
been
alone
,
would
have
made
his
way
back
to
the
side
of
Hugh
,
who
to
his
clouded
intellect
now
shone
forth
with
the
new
lustre
of
being
his
preserver
and
truest
friend
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
father
's
terror
of
remaining
in
the
streets
,
communicated
itself
to
him
when
he
comprehended
the
full
extent
of
his
fears
,
and
impressed
him
with
the
same
eagerness
to
fly
to
a
place
of
safety
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
corner
of
the
market
among
the
pens
for
cattle
,
Barnaby
knelt
down
,
and
pausing
every
now
and
then
to
pass
his
hand
over
his
father
's
face
,
or
look
up
to
him
with
a
smile
,
knocked
off
his
irons
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
seen
him
spring
,
a
free
man
,
to
his
feet
,
and
had
given
vent
to
the
transport
of
delight
which
the
sight
awakened
,
he
went
to
work
upon
his
own
,
which
soon
fell
rattling
down
upon
the
ground
,
and
left
his
limbs
unfettered
.
  
<EOS>
Gliding
away
together
when
this
task
was
accomplished
,
and
passing
several
groups
of
men
,
each
gathered
round
a
stooping
figure
to
hide
him
from
those
who
passed
,
but
unable
to
repress
the
clanking
sound
of
hammers
,
which
told
that
they
too
were
busy
at
the
same
work
,
---
the
two
fugitives
made
towards
Clerkenwell
,
and
passing
thence
to
Islington
,
as
the
nearest
point
of
egress
,
were
quickly
in
the
fields
.
 
<EOS>
After
wandering
about
for
a
long
time
,
they
found
in
a
pasture
near
Finchley
a
poor
shed
,
with
walls
of
mud
,
and
roof
of
grass
and
brambles
,
built
for
some
cowherd
,
but
now
deserted
.
<EOS>
Here
,
they
lay
down
for
the
rest
of
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
They
wandered
to
and
fro
when
it
was
day
,
and
once
Barnaby
went
off
alone
to
a
cluster
of
little
cottages
two
or
three
miles
away
,
to
purchase
some
bread
and
milk
.
 
<EOS>
But
finding
no
better
shelter
,
they
returned
to
the
same
place
,
and
lay
down
again
to
wait
for
night
.
  
<EOS>
Heaven
alone
can
tell
,
with
what
vague
hopes
of
duty
,
and
affection
;
with
what
strange
promptings
of
nature
,
intelligible
to
him
as
to
a
man
of
radiant
mind
and
most
enlarged
capacity
;
with
what
dim
memories
of
children
he
had
played
with
when
a
child
himself
,
who
had
prattled
of
their
fathers
,
and
of
loving
them
,
and
being
loved
;
with
how
many
half
-
remembered
,
dreamy
associations
of
his
mother
's
grief
and
tears
and
widowhood
;
he
watched
and
tended
this
man
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
a
vague
and
shadowy
crowd
of
such
ideas
came
slowly
on
him
;
that
they
taught
him
to
be
sorry
when
he
looked
upon
his
haggard
face
,
that
they
overflowed
his
eyes
when
he
stooped
to
kiss
him
,
that
they
kept
him
waking
in
a
tearful
gladness
,
shading
him
from
the
sun
,
fanning
him
with
leaves
,
soothing
him
when
he
started
in
his
sleep
---
ah
!
<EOS>
what
a
troubled
sleep
it
was
---
and
wondering
when
SHE
would
come
to
join
them
and
be
happy
,
is
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
He
sat
beside
him
all
that
day
;
listening
for
her
footsteps
in
every
breath
of
air
,
looking
for
her
shadow
on
the
gently
-
waving
grass
,
twining
the
hedge
flowers
for
her
pleasure
when
she
came
,
and
his
when
he
awoke
;
and
stooping
down
from
time
to
time
to
listen
to
his
mutterings
,
and
wonder
why
he
was
so
restless
in
that
quiet
place
.
 
<EOS>
The
sun
went
down
,
and
night
came
on
,
and
he
was
still
quite
tranquil
;
busied
with
these
thoughts
,
as
if
there
were
no
other
people
in
the
world
,
and
the
dull
cloud
of
smoke
hanging
on
the
immense
city
in
the
distance
,
hid
no
vices
,
no
crimes
,
no
life
or
death
,
or
cause
of
disquiet
---
<EOS>
nothing
but
clear
air
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
hour
had
now
come
when
he
must
go
alone
to
find
out
the
blind
man
(
a
task
that
filled
him
with
delight
)
and
bring
him
to
that
place
;
taking
especial
care
that
he
was
not
watched
or
followed
on
his
way
back
.
 
<EOS>
He
listened
to
the
directions
he
must
observe
,
repeated
them
again
and
again
,
and
after
twice
or
thrice
returning
to
surprise
his
father
with
a
light
-
hearted
laugh
,
went
forth
,
at
last
,
upon
his
errand
:
leaving
Grip
,
whom
he
had
carried
from
the
jail
in
his
arms
,
to
his
care
.
  
<EOS>
Fleet
of
foot
,
and
anxious
to
return
,
he
sped
swiftly
on
towards
the
city
,
but
could
not
reach
it
before
the
fires
began
,
and
made
the
night
angry
with
their
dismal
lustre
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
entered
the
town
---
it
might
be
that
he
was
changed
by
going
there
without
his
late
companions
,
and
on
no
violent
errand
;
or
by
the
beautiful
solitude
in
which
he
had
passed
the
day
,
or
by
the
thoughts
that
had
come
upon
him
,
---
but
it
seemed
peopled
by
a
legion
of
devils
.
<EOS>
This
flight
and
pursuit
,
this
cruel
burning
and
destroying
,
these
dreadful
cries
and
stunning
noises
,
were
THEY
the
good
lord
's
noble
cause
!
  
<EOS>
Though
almost
stupefied
by
the
bewildering
scene
,
still
be
found
the
blind
man
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
shut
up
and
tenantless
.
  
<EOS>
He
waited
for
a
long
while
,
but
no
one
came
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
he
withdrew
;
and
as
he
knew
by
this
time
that
the
soldiers
were
firing
,
and
many
people
must
have
been
killed
,
he
went
down
into
Holborn
,
where
he
heard
the
great
crowd
was
,
to
try
if
he
could
find
Hugh
,
and
persuade
him
to
avoid
the
danger
,
and
return
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
If
he
had
been
stunned
and
shocked
before
,
his
horror
was
increased
a
thousandfold
when
he
got
into
this
vortex
of
the
riot
,
and
not
being
an
actor
in
the
terrible
spectacle
,
had
it
all
before
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
,
in
the
midst
,
towering
above
them
all
,
close
before
the
house
they
were
attacking
now
,
was
Hugh
on
horseback
,
calling
to
the
rest
!
  
<EOS>
Sickened
by
the
sights
surrounding
him
on
every
side
,
and
by
the
heat
and
roar
,
and
crash
,
he
forced
his
way
among
the
crowd
(
where
many
recognised
him
,
and
with
shouts
pressed
back
to
let
him
pass
)
,
and
in
time
was
nearly
up
with
Hugh
,
who
was
savagely
threatening
some
one
,
but
whom
or
what
he
said
,
he
could
not
,
in
the
great
confusion
,
understand
.
 
<EOS>
At
that
moment
the
crowd
forced
their
way
into
the
house
,
and
Hugh
---
it
was
impossible
to
see
by
what
means
,
in
such
a
concourse
---
fell
headlong
down
.
  
<EOS>
Barnaby
was
beside
him
when
he
staggered
to
his
feet
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
<EOS>
well
he
made
him
hear
his
voice
,
or
Hugh
,
with
his
uplifted
axe
,
would
have
cleft
his
skull
in
twain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Barnaby
---
you
!
 
<EOS>
Whose
hand
was
that
,
that
struck
me
down
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
mine
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whose
!
---
I
say
,
whose
!
"
he
cried
,
reeling
back
,
and
looking
wildly
round
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
doing
?
 
<EOS>
Where
is
he
?
 
<EOS>
Show
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
hurt
,
"
said
Barnaby
---
as
indeed
he
was
,
in
the
head
,
both
by
the
blow
he
had
received
,
and
by
his
horse
's
hoof
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
away
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
he
took
the
horse
's
bridle
in
his
hand
,
turned
him
,
and
dragged
Hugh
several
paces
.
 
<EOS>
This
brought
them
out
of
the
crowd
,
which
was
pouring
from
the
street
into
the
vintner
's
cellars
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
's
---
where
's
Dennis
?
"
said
Hugh
,
coming
to
a
stop
,
and
checking
Barnaby
with
his
strong
arm
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
has
he
been
all
day
?
<EOS>
What
did
he
mean
by
leaving
me
as
he
did
,
in
the
jail
,
last
night
?
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
you
---
d'ye
hear
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
a
flourish
of
his
dangerous
weapon
,
he
fell
down
upon
the
ground
like
a
log
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
minute
,
though
already
frantic
with
drinking
and
with
the
wound
in
his
head
,
he
crawled
to
a
stream
of
burning
spirit
which
was
pouring
down
the
kennel
,
and
began
to
drink
at
it
as
if
it
were
a
brook
of
water
.
  
<EOS>
Barnaby
drew
him
away
,
and
forced
him
to
rise
.
 
<EOS>
Though
he
could
neither
stand
nor
walk
,
he
involuntarily
staggered
to
his
horse
,
climbed
upon
his
back
,
and
clung
there
.
 
<EOS>
After
vainly
attempting
to
divest
the
animal
of
his
clanking
trappings
,
Barnaby
sprung
up
behind
him
,
snatched
the
bridle
,
turned
into
Leather
Lane
,
which
was
close
at
hand
,
and
urged
the
frightened
horse
into
a
heavy
trot
.
  
<EOS>
He
looked
back
,
once
,
before
he
left
the
street
;
and
looked
upon
a
sight
not
easily
to
be
erased
,
even
from
his
remembrance
,
so
long
as
he
had
life
.
  
<EOS>
The
vintner
's
house
with
a
half
-
a
-
dozen
others
near
at
hand
,
was
one
great
,
glowing
blaze
.
 
<EOS>
All
night
,
no
one
had
essayed
to
quench
the
flames
,
or
stop
their
progress
;
but
now
a
body
of
soldiers
were
actively
engaged
in
pulling
down
two
old
wooden
houses
,
which
were
every
moment
in
danger
of
taking
fire
,
and
which
could
scarcely
fail
,
if
they
were
left
to
burn
,
to
extend
the
conflagration
immensely
.
 
<EOS>
The
tumbling
down
of
nodding
walls
and
heavy
blocks
of
wood
,
the
hooting
and
the
execrations
of
the
crowd
,
the
distant
firing
of
other
military
detachments
,
the
distracted
looks
and
cries
of
those
whose
habitations
were
in
danger
,
the
hurrying
to
and
fro
of
frightened
people
with
their
goods
;
the
reflections
in
every
quarter
of
the
sky
,
of
deep
,
red
,
soaring
flames
,
as
though
the
last
day
had
come
and
the
whole
universe
were
burning
;
the
dust
,
and
smoke
,
and
drift
of
fiery
particles
,
scorching
and
kindling
all
it
fell
upon
;
the
hot
unwholesome
vapour
,
the
blight
on
everything
;
the
stars
,
and
moon
,
and
very
sky
,
obliterated
;
---
made
up
such
a
sum
of
dreariness
and
ruin
,
that
it
seemed
as
if
the
face
of
Heaven
were
blotted
out
,
and
night
,
in
its
rest
and
quiet
,
and
softened
light
,
never
could
look
upon
the
earth
again
.
  
<EOS>
But
there
was
a
worse
spectacle
than
this
---
worse
by
far
than
fire
and
smoke
,
or
even
the
rabble
's
unappeasable
and
maniac
rage
.
 
<EOS>
The
gutters
of
the
street
,
and
every
crack
and
fissure
in
the
stones
,
ran
with
scorching
spirit
,
which
being
dammed
up
by
busy
hands
,
overflowed
the
road
and
pavement
,
and
formed
a
great
pool
,
into
which
the
people
dropped
down
dead
by
dozens
.
 
<EOS>
They
lay
in
heaps
<EOS>
all
round
this
fearful
pond
,
husbands
and
wives
,
fathers
and
sons
,
mothers
and
daughters
,
women
with
children
in
their
arms
and
babies
at
their
breasts
,
and
drank
until
they
died
.
 
<EOS>
While
some
stooped
with
their
lips
to
the
brink
and
never
raised
their
heads
again
,
others
sprang
up
from
their
fiery
draught
,
and
danced
,
half
in
a
mad
triumph
,
and
half
in
the
agony
of
suffocation
,
until
they
fell
,
and
steeped
their
corpses
in
the
liquor
that
had
killed
them
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
even
this
the
worst
or
most
appalling
kind
of
death
that
happened
on
this
fatal
night
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
burning
cellars
,
where
they
drank
out
of
hats
,
pails
,
buckets
,
tubs
,
and
shoes
,
some
men
were
drawn
,
alive
,
but
all
alight
from
head
to
foot
;
who
,
in
their
unendurable
anguish
and
suffering
,
making
for
anything
that
had
the
look
of
water
,
rolled
,
hissing
,
in
this
hideous
lake
,
and
splashed
up
liquid
fire
which
lapped
in
all
it
met
with
as
it
ran
along
the
surface
,
and
neither
spared
the
living
nor
the
dead
.
 
<EOS>
On
this
last
night
of
the
great
riots
---
for
the
last
night
it
was
---
the
wretched
victims
of
a
senseless
outcry
,
became
themselves
the
dust
and
ashes
of
the
flames
they
had
kindled
,
and
strewed
the
public
streets
of
London
.
  
<EOS>
With
all
he
saw
in
this
last
glance
fixed
indelibly
upon
his
mind
,
Barnaby
hurried
from
the
city
which
enclosed
such
horrors
;
and
holding
down
his
head
that
he
might
not
even
see
the
glare
of
the
fires
upon
the
quiet
landscape
,
was
soon
in
the
still
country
roads
.
  
<EOS>
He
stopped
at
about
half
-
a
-
mile
from
the
shed
where
his
father
lay
,
and
with
some
difficulty
making
Hugh
sensible
that
he
must
dismount
,
sunk
the
horse
's
furniture
in
a
pool
of
stagnant
water
,
and
turned
the
animal
loose
.
 
<EOS>
That
done
,
he
supported
his
companion
as
well
as
he
could
,
and
led
him
slowly
forward
.

Chapter
69
    
<EOS>
It
was
the
dead
of
night
,
and
very
dark
,
when
Barnaby
,
with
his
stumbling
comrade
,
approached
the
place
where
he
had
left
his
father
;
but
he
could
see
him
stealing
away
into
the
gloom
,
distrustful
even
of
him
,
and
rapidly
retreating
.
 
<EOS>
After
calling
to
him
twice
or
thrice
that
there
was
nothing
to
fear
,
but
without
effect
,
he
suffered
Hugh
to
sink
upon
the
ground
,
and
followed
to
bring
him
back
.
  
<EOS>
He
continued
to
creep
away
,
until
Barnaby
was
close
upon
him
;
then
turned
,
and
said
in
a
terrible
,
though
suppressed
voice
:
  
"
Let
me
go
.
 
<EOS>
Do
not
lay
hands
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
told
her
;
and
you
and
she
together
have
betrayed
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
Barnaby
looked
at
him
,
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
seen
your
mother
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
cried
Barnaby
,
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
for
a
long
time
---
longer
than
I
can
tell
.
 
<EOS>
A
whole
year
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
Is
she
here
?
"
  
<EOS>
His
father
looked
upon
him
steadfastly
for
a
few
moments
,
and
then
said
---
drawing
nearer
to
him
as
he
spoke
,
for
,
seeing
his
face
,
and
hearing
his
words
<EOS>
,
it
was
impossible
to
doubt
his
truth
:
  
<EOS>
"
What
man
is
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hugh
---
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
Only
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
him
.
 
<EOS>
HE
will
not
harm
you
.
<EOS>
Why
,
you
're
afraid
of
Hugh
!
 
<EOS>
Ha
ha
ha
!
 
<EOS>
Afraid
of
gruff
,
old
,
noisy
Hugh
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
man
is
he
,
I
ask
you
,
"
he
rejoined
so
fiercely
,
that
Barnaby
stopped
in
his
laugh
,
and
shrinking
back
,
surveyed
him
with
a
look
of
terrified
amazement
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
how
stern
you
are
!
 
<EOS>
You
make
me
fear
you
,
though
you
are
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
Why
do
you
speak
to
me
so
?
"
   
---
<EOS>
"
I
want
,
"
he
answered
,
putting
away
the
hand
which
his
son
,
with
a
timid
desire
to
propitiate
him
,
laid
upon
his
sleeve
,
---
"
I
want
an
answer
,
and
you
give
me
only
jeers
and
questions
.
 
<EOS>
Who
have
you
brought
with
you
to
this
hiding
-
place
,
poor
fool
;
and
where
is
the
blind
man
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
where
.
 
<EOS>
His
house
was
close
shut
.
 
<EOS>
I
waited
,
but
no
person
came
;
that
was
no
fault
of
mine
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
Hugh
---
brave
Hugh
,
who
broke
into
that
ugly
jail
,
and
set
us
free
.
 
<EOS>
Aha
!
 
<EOS>
You
like
him
now
,
do
you
?
 
<EOS>
You
like
him
now
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
does
he
lie
upon
the
ground
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
had
a
fall
,
and
has
been
drinking
.
 
<EOS>
The
fields
and
trees
go
round
,
and
round
,
and
round
with
him
,
and
the
ground
heaves
under
his
feet
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
him
?
 
<EOS>
You
remember
?
 
<EOS>
See
!
"
  
<EOS>
They
had
by
this
time
returned
to
where
he
lay
,
and
both
stooped
over
him
to
look
into
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
recollect
the
man
,
"
his
father
murmured
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
did
you
bring
him
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
he
would
have
been
killed
if
I
had
left
him
over
yonder
.
<EOS>
They
were
firing
guns
and
shedding
blood
.
 
<EOS>
Does
the
sight
of
blood
turn
you
sick
,
father
?
 
<EOS>
I
see
it
does
,
by
your
face
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
like
me
<EOS>
---
What
are
you
looking
at
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
nothing
!
"
said
the
murderer
softly
,
as
he
started
back
a
pace
or
two
,
and
gazed
with
sunken
jaw
and
staring
eyes
above
his
son
's
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
nothing
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
remained
in
the
same
attitude
and
with
the
same
expression
on
his
face
for
a
minute
or
more
;
then
glanced
slowly
round
as
if
he
had
lost
something
;
and
went
shivering
back
,
towards
the
shed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
bring
him
in
,
father
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Barnaby
,
who
had
looked
on
,
wondering
.
  
<EOS>
He
only
answered
with
a
suppressed
groan
,
and
lying
down
upon
the
ground
,
wrapped
his
cloak
about
his
head
,
and
shrunk
into
the
darkest
corner
.
  
<EOS>
Finding
that
nothing
would
rouse
Hugh
now
,
or
make
him
sensible
for
a
moment
,
Barnaby
dragged
him
along
the
grass
,
and
laid
him
on
a
little
heap
of
refuse
hay
and
straw
which
had
been
his
own
bed
;
first
having
brought
some
water
from
a
running
stream
hard
by
,
and
washed
his
wound
,
and
laved
his
hands
and
face
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
lay
down
himself
,
between
the
two
,
to
pass
the
night
;
and
looking
at
the
stars
,
fell
fast
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
Awakened
early
in
the
morning
,
by
the
sunshine
and
the
songs
of
birds
,
and
hum
of
insects
,
he
left
them
sleeping
in
the
hut
,
and
walked
into
the
sweet
and
pleasant
air
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
felt
that
on
his
jaded
senses
,
oppressed
and
burdened
with
the
dreadful
scenes
of
last
night
,
and
many
nights
before
,
all
the
beauties
of
opening
day
,
which
he
had
so
often
tasted
,
and
in
which
he
had
had
such
deep
delight
,
fell
heavily
.
 
<EOS>
He
thought
of
the
blithe
mornings
when
he
and
the
dogs
went
bounding
on
together
through
the
woods
and
fields
;
and
the
recollection
filled
his
eyes
with
tears
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
no
consciousness
<EOS>
,
God
help
him
,
of
having
done
wrong
,
nor
had
he
any
new
perception
of
the
merits
of
the
cause
in
which
he
had
been
engaged
,
or
those
of
the
men
who
advocated
it
;
but
he
was
full
of
cares
now
,
and
regrets
,
and
dismal
recollections
,
and
wishes
(
quite
unknown
to
him
before
)
that
this
or
that
event
had
never
happened
,
and
that
the
sorrow
and
suffering
of
so
many
people
had
been
spared
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
he
began
to
think
how
happy
they
would
be
---
his
father
,
mother
,
he
,
and
Hugh
---
if
they
rambled
away
together
,
and
lived
in
some
lonely
place
,
where
there
were
none
of
these
troubles
;
and
that
perhaps
the
blind
man
,
who
had
talked
so
wisely
about
gold
,
and
told
him
of
the
great
secrets
he
knew
,
could
teach
them
how
to
live
without
being
pinched
by
want
.
 
<EOS>
As
this
occurred
to
him
,
he
was
the
more
sorry
that
he
had
not
seen
him
last
night
;
and
he
was
still
brooding
over
this
regret
,
when
his
father
came
,
and
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
cried
Barnaby
,
starting
from
his
fit
of
thoughtfulness
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
it
only
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
should
it
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
almost
thought
,
"
he
answered
,
"
it
was
the
blind
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
have
some
talk
with
him
,
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
so
must
I
,
for
without
seeing
him
,
I
do
n't
know
where
to
fly
or
what
to
do
,
and
lingering
here
,
is
death
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
go
to
him
again
,
and
bring
him
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Must
I
!
"
cried
Barnaby
,
delighted
;
"
that
's
brave
,
father
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
what
I
want
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
must
bring
only
him
,
and
none
other
.
 
<EOS>
And
though
you
wait
at
his
door
a
whole
day
and
night
,
still
you
must
wait
,
and
not
come
back
without
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
fear
that
,
"
he
cried
gaily
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
shall
come
,
he
shall
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Trim
off
these
gewgaws
,
"
said
his
father
,
plucking
the
scraps
of
ribbon
and
the
feathers
from
his
hat
,
"
and
over
your
own
dress
wear
my
cloak
.
 
<EOS>
Take
heed
how
you
go
,
and
they
will
be
too
busy
in
the
streets
to
notice
you
.
 
<EOS>
Of
your
coming
back
<EOS>
you
need
take
no
account
,
for
he
'll
manage
that
,
safely
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
!
"
said
Barnaby
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
he
will
!
 
<EOS>
A
wise
man
,
father
,
and
one
who
can
teach
us
to
be
rich
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
know
him
,
I
know
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
speedily
dressed
,
and
as
well
disguised
as
he
could
be
.
<EOS>
With
a
lighter
heart
he
then
set
off
upon
his
second
journey
,
leaving
Hugh
,
who
was
still
in
a
drunken
stupor
,
stretched
upon
the
ground
within
the
shed
,
and
his
father
walking
to
and
fro
before
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
murderer
,
full
of
anxious
thoughts
,
looked
after
him
,
and
paced
up
and
down
,
disquieted
by
every
breath
of
air
that
whispered
among
the
boughs
,
and
by
every
light
shadow
thrown
by
the
passing
clouds
upon
the
daisied
ground
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
anxious
for
his
safe
return
,
and
yet
,
though
his
own
life
and
safety
hung
upon
it
,
felt
a
relief
while
he
was
gone
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
intense
selfishness
which
the
constant
presence
before
him
of
his
great
crimes
,
and
their
consequences
here
and
hereafter
,
engendered
,
every
thought
of
Barnaby
,
as
his
son
,
was
swallowed
up
and
lost
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
his
presence
was
a
torture
and
reproach
;
in
his
wild
eyes
,
there
were
terrible
images
of
that
guilty
night
;
with
his
unearthly
aspect
,
and
his
half
-
formed
mind
,
he
seemed
to
the
murderer
a
creature
who
had
sprung
into
existence
from
his
victim
's
blood
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
bear
his
look
,
his
voice
,
his
touch
;
and
yet
he
was
forced
,
by
his
own
desperate
condition
and
his
only
hope
of
cheating
the
gibbet
,
to
have
him
by
his
side
,
and
to
know
that
he
was
inseparable
from
his
single
chance
of
escape
.
  
<EOS>
He
walked
to
and
fro
,
with
little
rest
,
all
day
,
revolving
these
things
in
his
mind
;
and
still
Hugh
lay
,
unconscious
,
in
the
shed
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
when
the
sun
was
setting
,
Barnaby
returned
,
leading
the
blind
man
,
and
talking
earnestly
to
him
as
they
came
along
together
.
  
<EOS>
The
murderer
advanced
to
meet
them
,
and
bidding
his
son
go
on
and
speak
to
Hugh
,
who
had
just
then
staggered
to
his
feet
,
took
his
place
at
the
blind
man
's
elbow
,
and
slowly
followed
,
towards
the
shed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
did
you
send
HIM
?
"
said
Stagg
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
know
it
was
the
way
to
have
him
lost
,
as
soon
as
found
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Would
you
have
had
me
come
myself
?
"
returned
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
before
the
jail
on
Tuesday
night
,
but
missed
you
in
the
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
out
last
night
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
good
work
last
night
---
gay
work
---
profitable
work
"
---
he
added
,
rattling
the
money
in
his
pockets
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
---
"
   
---
"
Seen
your
good
lady
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
you
mean
to
tell
me
more
,
or
not
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
all
,
"
returned
the
blind
man
,
with
a
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Excuse
me
---
but
I
love
to
see
you
so
impatient
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
energy
in
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Does
she
consent
to
say
the
word
that
may
save
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
returned
the
blind
man
emphatically
,
as
he
turned
his
face
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
been
at
death
's
door
since
she
lost
her
darling
---
has
been
insensible
,
and
I
know
not
what
.
 
<EOS>
I
tracked
her
to
a
hospital
,
and
presented
myself
(
with
your
leave
)
at
her
bedside
.
 
<EOS>
Our
talk
was
not
a
long
one
,
for
she
was
weak
,
and
there
being
people
near
I
was
not
quite
easy
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
told
her
all
that
you
and
I
agreed
upon
,
and
pointed
out
the
young
gentleman
's
position
,
in
strong
terms
.
 
<EOS>
She
tried
to
soften
me
,
but
that
,
of
course
(
as
I
told
her
)
,
was
lost
time
.
 
<EOS>
She
cried
and
moaned
<EOS>
,
you
may
be
sure
;
all
women
do
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
of
a
sudden
,
she
found
her
voice
and
strength
,
and
said
that
Heaven
would
help
her
and
her
innocent
son
;
and
that
to
Heaven
she
appealed
against
us
---
which
she
did
;
<EOS>
in
really
very
pretty
language
,
I
assure
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
advised
her
,
as
a
friend
,
not
to
count
too
much
on
assistance
from
any
such
distant
quarter
---
recommended
her
to
think
of
it
---
told
her
where
I
lived
---
 
<EOS>
said
I
knew
she
would
send
to
me
before
noon
,
next
day
---
and
left
her
,
either
in
a
faint
or
shamming
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
he
had
concluded
this
narration
,
during
which
he
had
made
several
pauses
,
for
the
convenience
of
cracking
and
eating
nuts
,
of
which
he
seemed
to
have
a
pocketful
,
the
blind
man
pulled
a
flask
from
his
pocket
,
took
a
draught
himself
,
and
offered
it
to
his
companion
.
  
<EOS>

You

<EOS>
he
said
,
feeling
that
he
pushed
it
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
Then
the
gallant
gentleman
who
's
lodging
with
you
,
will
.
 
<EOS>
Hallo
,
bully
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Death
!
"
said
the
other
,
holding
him
back
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
tell
me
what
I
am
to
do
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
!
 
<EOS>
Nothing
easier
.
 
<EOS>
Make
a
moonlight
flitting
in
two
hours
'
time
with
the
young
gentleman
<EOS>
(
he
's
quite
ready
to
go
;
I
have
been
giving
him
good
advice
as
we
came
along
)
,
and
get
as
far
from
London
as
you
can
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
know
where
you
are
,
and
leave
the
rest
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
MUST
come
round
;
she
ca
n't
hold
out
long
;
and
as
to
the
chances
of
your
being
retaken
in
the
meanwhile
,
why
it
was
n't
one
man
who
got
out
of
Newgate
,
but
three
hundred
.
 
<EOS>
Think
of
that
,
for
your
comfort
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
support
life
.
 
<EOS>
How
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
How
!
"
repeated
the
blind
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
eating
and
drinking
.
 
<EOS>
And
how
get
meat
and
drink
,
but
by
paying
for
it
!
 
<EOS>
Money
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
slapping
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
money
the
word
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
the
streets
have
been
running
money
.
 
<EOS>
Devil
send
that
the
sport
's
not
over
yet
,
for
these
are
jolly
times
;
golden
,
rare
,
roaring
,
scrambling
times
.
<EOS>
Hallo

<EOS>
Hallo

<EOS>
Hallo

<EOS>
Drink
,
bully
,
drink
.
 
<EOS>
Where
are
ye
there
!
 
<EOS>
Hallo
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
such
vociferations
,
and
with
a
boisterous
manner
which
bespoke
his
perfect
abandonment
to
the
general
licence
and
disorder
,
he
groped
his
way
towards
the
shed
,
where
Hugh
and
Barnaby
were
sitting
on
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
"
Put
it
about
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
handing
his
flask
to
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
kennels
run
with
wine
and
gold
.
 
<EOS>
Guineas
and
strong
water
flow
from
the
very
pumps
.
 
<EOS>
About
with
it
,
do
n't
spare
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
Exhausted
,
unwashed
,
unshorn
,
begrimed
with
smoke
and
dust
,
<EOS>
his
hair
clotted
with
blood
,
his
voice
quite
gone
,
so
that
he
spoke
in
whispers
;
his
skin
parched
up
by
fever
,
his
whole
body
bruised
and
cut
,
and
beaten
about
<EOS>
,
Hugh
still
took
the
flask
,
and
raised
it
to
his
lips
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
in
the
act
of
drinking
,
when
the
front
of
the
shed
was
suddenly
darkened
,
and
Dennis
stood
before
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
offence
,
no
offence
,
"
said
that
personage
in
a
conciliatory
tone
,
as
Hugh
stopped
in
his
draught
,
and
eyed
him
,
with
no
pleasant
look
,
from
head
to
foot
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
offence
,
brother
.
 
<EOS>
Barnaby
here
too
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
How
are
you
,
Barnaby
?
 
<EOS>
And
two
other
gentlemen
!
<EOS>
Your
humble
servant
,
gentlemen
.
 
<EOS>
No
offence
to
YOU
either
<EOS>
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
Eh
,
brothers
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
that
he
spoke
in
this
very
friendly
and
confident
manner
,
he
seemed
to
have
considerable
hesitation
about
entering
,
and
remained
outside
the
roof
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
rather
better
dressed
than
usual
:
wearing
the
same
suit
of
threadbare
black
,
it
is
true
,
but
having
round
his
neck
an
unwholesome
-
looking
cravat
of
a
yellowish
white
;
and
,
on
his
hands
,
great
leather
gloves
,
such
as
a
gardener
might
wear
in
following
his
trade
.
 
<EOS>
His
shoes
were
newly
greased
,
and
ornamented
with
a
pair
of
rusty
iron
buckles
;
the
packthread
at
his
knees
had
been
renewed
;
and
where
he
wanted
buttons
,
he
wore
pins
.
 
<EOS>
Altogether
,
he
had
something
<EOS>
the
look
of
a
tipstaff
,
or
a
bailiff
's
follower
,
desperately
faded
,
but
who
had
a
notion
of
keeping
up
the
appearance
of
a
professional
character
,
and
making
the
best
of
the
worst
means
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
very
snug
here
,
"
said
Mr
Dennis
,
pulling
out
a
mouldy
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
which
looked
like
a
decomposed
halter
,
and
wiping
his
forehead
in
a
nervous
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
snug
enough
to
prevent
your
finding
us
,
it
seems
,
"
Hugh
answered
,
sulkily
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
brother
,
"
said
Dennis
,
with
a
friendly
smile
,
"
when
you
do
n't
want
me
to
know
which
way
you
're
riding
,
you
must
wear
another
sort
of
bells
on
your
horse
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
know
the
sound
of
them
you
wore
last
night
,
and
have
got
quick
ears
for
'em
;
that
's
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
but
how
are
you
,
brother
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
by
this
time
approached
,
and
now
ventured
to
sit
down
by
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
am
I
?
"
answered
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
were
you
yesterday
?
 
<EOS>
Where
did
you
go
when
you
left
me
in
the
jail
?
 
<EOS>
Why
did
you
leave
me
?
 
<EOS>
And
what
did
you
mean
by
rolling
your
eyes
and
shaking
your
fist
at
me
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shake
my
fist
!
<EOS>
---
at
you
,
brother
!
"
said
Dennis
,
gently
checking
Hugh
's
uplifted
hand
,
which
looked
threatening
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
stick
,
then
;
it
's
all
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lord
love
you
,
brother
,
I
meant
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
understand
me
by
half
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
n't
wonder
now
,
"
he
added
,
in
the
tone
of
a
desponding
and
an
injured
man
,
"
but
you
thought
,
because
I
wanted
them
chaps
left
in
the
prison
,
<EOS>
that
I
was
a
going
to
desert
the
banners
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
told
him
,
with
an
oath
,
that
he
had
thought
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
Mr
Dennis
,
mournfully
,
"
if
you
an't
enough
to
make
a
man
mistrust
his
feller
-
creeturs
,
I
do
n't
know
what
is
.
 
<EOS>
Desert
<EOS>
the
banners
!
 
<EOS>
Me
!
 
<EOS>
Ned
Dennis
,
as
was
so
christened
by
his
own
father
!
<EOS>
---
Is
this
axe
your'n
,
brother
?
"
  
<EOS>
Yes
,
it
's
mine
,
"
said
Hugh
,
in
the
same
sullen
manner
as
before
;
"
it
might
have
hurt
you
,
if
you
had
come
in
its
way
once
or
twice
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
Put
it
down
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Might
have
hurt
me
!
"
said
Mr
Dennis
,
still
keeping
it
in
his
hand
,
and
feeling
the
edge
with
an
air
of
abstraction
.
 
<EOS>
"
Might
have
hurt
me
!
<EOS>
and
me
exerting
myself
all
the
time
to
the
wery
best
advantage
.
<EOS>
Here
's
a
world
!
 
<EOS>
And
you
're
not
a
-
going
to
ask
me
to
take
a
sup
out
of
that
<EOS>
'
ere
bottle
,
eh
?
"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
passed
it
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
raised
it
to
his
lips
,
Barnaby
jumped
up
,
and
motioning
them
to
be
silent
,
looked
eagerly
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
,
Barnaby
?
"
said
Dennis
,
glancing
at
Hugh
and
dropping
the
flask
,
but
still
holding
the
axe
in
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
<EOS>
he
answered
softly
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
I
see
glittering
behind
the
hedge
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
cried
the
hangman
,
raising
his
voice
to
its
highest
pitch
,
and
laying
hold
of
him
and
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
SOLDIERS
,
surely
!
"
  
<EOS>
That
moment
,
the
shed
was
filled
with
armed
men
;
and
a
body
of
horse
,
galloping
into
the
field
,
drew
up
before
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
said
Dennis
,
who
remained
untouched
among
them
when
they
had
seized
their
prisoners
;
"
it
's
them
two
young
ones
,
gentlemen
,
that
the
proclamation
puts
a
price
on
.
 
<EOS>
This
other
's
an
escaped
felon
.
<EOS>
---
I
'm
sorry
for
it
,
brother
,
"
he
added
,
in
a
tone
of
resignation
,
addressing
himself
to
Hugh
;
"
but
you
've
brought
it
on
yourself
;
you
forced
me
to
do
it
;
you
would
n't
respect
the
soundest
constitootional
principles
,
you
know
;
you
went
and
wiolated
the
wery
framework
of
society
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
sooner
have
given
away
a
trifle
in
charity
than
done
this
,
I
would
upon
my
soul
.
<EOS>
---
If
you
'll
keep
fast
hold
on
'em
,
gentlemen
,
I
think
I
can
make
a
shift
to
tie
'em
better
than
you
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
this
operation
was
postponed
for
a
few
moments
by
a
new
occurrence
.
 
<EOS>
The
blind
man
,
whose
ears
were
quicker
than
most
people
's
sight
,
had
been
alarmed
,
before
Barnaby
,
by
a
rustling
in
the
bushes
,
under
cover
of
which
the
soldiers
had
advanced
.
 
<EOS>
He
retreated
instantly
---
had
hidden
somewhere
for
a
minute
---
and
probably
in
his
confusion
mistaking
the
point
at
which
he
had
emerged
,
was
now
seen
running
across
the
open
meadow
.
  
<EOS>
An
officer
cried
directly
that
he
had
helped
to
plunder
a
house
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
loudly
called
on
,
to
surrender
.
 
<EOS>
He
ran
the
harder
,
and
in
a
few
seconds
would
have
been
out
of
gunshot
.
 
<EOS>
The
word
was
given
,
and
the
men
fired
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
breathless
pause
and
a
profound
silence
,
during
which
all
eyes
were
fixed
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
seen
to
start
at
the
discharge
,
as
if
the
report
had
frightened
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
neither
stopped
nor
slackened
his
pace
in
the
least
,
and
ran
on
full
forty
yards
further
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
without
one
reel
or
stagger
,
or
sign
of
faintness
,
or
quivering
of
any
limb
,
he
dropped
.
  
<EOS>
Some
of
them
hurried
up
to
where
he
lay
;
---
the
hangman
with
them
.
<EOS>
Everything
had
passed
so
quickly
,
that
the
smoke
had
not
yet
scattered
,
but
curled
slowly
off
in
a
little
cloud
,
which
seemed
like
the
dead
man
's
spirit
moving
solemnly
away
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
a
few
drops
of
blood
upon
the
grass
---
<EOS>
more
,
when
they
turned
him
over
---
 
that
was
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
here
!
<EOS>
Look
here
!
"
said
the
hangman
,
stooping
one
knee
beside
the
body
,
and
gazing
up
with
a
disconsolate
face
at
the
officer
and
men
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
's
a
pretty
sight
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Stand
out
of
the
way
,
"
replied
the
officer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Serjeant
!
<EOS>
see
what
he
had
about
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
man
turned
his
pockets
out
upon
the
grass
,
and
counted
,
besides
some
foreign
coins
and
two
rings
,
five
-
and
-
forty
guineas
in
gold
.
<EOS>
These
were
bundled
up
in
a
handkerchief
and
carried
away
;
the
body
remained
there
for
the
present
,
but
six
men
and
the
serjeant
were
left
to
take
it
to
the
nearest
public
-
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
then
,
if
you
're
going
,
"
said
the
serjeant
,
clapping
Dennis
on
the
back
,
and
pointing
after
the
officer
who
was
walking
towards
the
shed
.
  
<EOS>
To
which
Mr
Dennis
only
replied
,
"
Do
n't
talk
to
me
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
repeated
what
he
had
said
before
,
namely
,
"
Here
's
a
pretty
sight
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
one
that
you
care
for
much
,
I
should
think
,
"
observed
the
serjeant
coolly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
who
,
"
said
Mr
Dennis
rising
,
"
should
care
for
it
,
if
I
do
n't
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
I
did
n't
know
you
was
so
tender
-
hearted
,
"
said
the
serjeant
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tender
-
hearted
!
"
echoed
Dennis
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tender
-
hearted
!
 
<EOS>
Look
at
this
man
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
call
THIS
constitootional
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
see
him
shot
through
and
through
instead
of
being
worked
off
like
a
Briton
?
<EOS>
Damme
,
if
I
know
which
party
to
side
with
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
as
bad
as
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
What
's
to
become
of
the
country
if
the
military
power
's
to
go
a
superseding
the
ciwilians
in
this
way
?
 
<EOS>
Where
's
this
poor
feller
-
creetur
's
rights
as
a
citizen
,
that
he
did
n't
have
ME
in
his
last
moments
!
 
<EOS>
I
was
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
willing
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
ready
.
 
<EOS>
These
are
nice
times
,
brother
,
to
have
the
dead
crying
out
against
us
in
this
way
,
and
sleep
comfortably
in
our
beds
arterwards
;
wery
nice
!
"
  
<EOS>
Whether
he
derived
any
material
consolation
from
binding
the
prisoners
,
is
uncertain
;
most
probably
he
did
.
 
<EOS>
At
all
events
his
being
summoned
to
that
work
,
diverted
him
,
for
the
time
,
from
these
painful
reflections
,
and
gave
his
thoughts
a
more
congenial
occupation
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
not
all
three
carried
off
together
,
but
in
two
parties
;
Barnaby
and
his
father
,
going
by
one
road
in
the
centre
of
a
body
of
foot
;
and
Hugh
,
fast
bound
upon
a
horse
,
and
strongly
guarded
by
a
troop
of
cavalry
,
being
taken
by
another
.
  
<EOS>
They
had
no
opportunity
for
the
least
communication
,
in
the
short
interval
which
preceded
their
departure
;
being
kept
strictly
apart
.
<EOS>
Hugh
only
observed
that
Barnaby
walked
with
a
drooping
head
among
his
guard
,
and
,
without
raising
his
eyes
,
that
he
tried
to
wave
his
fettered
hand
when
he
passed
.
 
<EOS>
For
himself
,
he
buoyed
up
his
courage
as
he
rode
along
,
with
the
assurance
that
the
mob
would
force
his
jail
wherever
it
might
be
,
and
set
him
at
liberty
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
they
got
into
London
,
and
more
especially
into
Fleet
Market
,
lately
the
stronghold
of
the
rioters
,
where
the
military
were
rooting
out
the
last
remnant
of
the
crowd
,
he
saw
that
this
hope
was
gone
,
and
felt
that
he
was
riding
to
his
death
.

Chapter
70
    
Mr
Dennis
having
despatched
this
piece
of
business
without
any
personal
hurt
or
inconvenience
,
and
having
now
retired
into
the
tranquil
respectability
of
private
life
,
resolved
to
solace
himself
with
half
an
hour
or
so
of
female
society
.
 
<EOS>
With
this
amiable
purpose
in
his
mind
,
he
bent
his
steps
towards
the
house
where
Dolly
and
Miss
Haredale
were
still
confined
,
and
whither
Miss
Miggs
had
also
been
removed
by
order
of
Mr
Simon
Tappertit
.
  
<EOS>
As
he
walked
along
the
streets
with
his
leather
gloves
clasped
behind
him
,
and
his
face
indicative
of
cheerful
thought
and
pleasant
calculation
,
Mr
Dennis
might
have
been
likened
unto
a
farmer
ruminating
among
his
crops
,
and
enjoying
by
anticipation
the
bountiful
gifts
of
Providence
.
 
<EOS>
Look
where
he
would
,
some
heap
of
ruins
afforded
him
rich
promise
of
a
working
off
;
the
whole
town
appeared
to
have
been
ploughed
and
sown
,
and
nurtured
by
most
genial
weather
;
and
a
goodly
harvest
was
at
hand
.
  
<EOS>
Having
taken
up
arms
and
resorted
to
deeds
of
violence
,
with
the
great
main
object
of
preserving
the
Old
Bailey
in
all
its
purity
,
and
the
gallows
in
all
its
pristine
usefulness
and
moral
grandeur
,
it
would
perhaps
be
going
too
far
to
assert
that
Mr
Dennis
had
ever
distinctly
contemplated
and
foreseen
this
happy
state
of
things
.
<EOS>
He
rather
looked
upon
it
as
one
of
those
beautiful
dispensations
which
are
inscrutably
brought
about
for
the
behoof
and
advantage
of
good
men
.
 
<EOS>
He
felt
,
as
it
were
,
personally
referred
to
,
in
this
prosperous
ripening
for
the
gibbet
;
and
had
never
considered
himself
so
much
the
pet
and
favourite
child
of
Destiny
,
or
loved
that
lady
so
well
or
with
such
a
calm
and
virtuous
reliance
,
in
all
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
being
taken
up
,
himself
,
for
a
rioter
,
and
punished
with
the
rest
,
Mr
Dennis
dismissed
that
possibility
from
his
thoughts
as
an
idle
chimera
;
arguing
that
the
line
of
conduct
he
had
adopted
at
Newgate
,
and
the
service
he
had
rendered
that
day
,
would
be
more
than
a
set
-
off
against
any
evidence
which
might
identify
him
as
a
member
of
the
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
That
any
charge
of
companionship
which
might
be
made
against
him
by
those
who
were
themselves
in
danger
,
would
certainly
go
for
nought
.
 
<EOS>
And
that
if
any
trivial
indiscretion
on
his
part
should
unluckily
come
out
,
the
uncommon
usefulness
of
his
office
,
at
present
,
and
the
great
demand
for
the
exercise
of
its
functions
,
would
certainly
cause
it
to
be
winked
at
,
and
passed
over
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
he
had
played
his
cards
throughout
,
with
great
care
;
had
changed
sides
at
the
very
nick
of
time
;
had
delivered
up
two
of
the
most
notorious
rioters
,
and
a
distinguished
felon
to
boot
;
and
was
quite
at
his
ease
.
  
<EOS>
Saving
---
for
there
is
a
reservation
;
and
even
Mr
Dennis
was
not
perfectly
happy
---
saving
for
one
circumstance
;
to
wit
,
the
forcible
detention
of
Dolly
and
Miss
Haredale
,
in
a
house
almost
adjoining
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
a
stumbling
-
block
;
for
<EOS>
if
they
were
discovered
and
released
,
they
could
,
by
the
testimony
they
had
it
in
their
power
to
give
,
place
him
in
a
situation
of
great
jeopardy
;
and
to
set
them
at
liberty
,
first
extorting
from
them
an
oath
of
secrecy
and
silence
<EOS>
,
was
a
thing
not
to
be
thought
of
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
more
,
perhaps
,
with
an
eye
to
the
danger
which
lurked
in
this
quarter
,
than
from
his
abstract
love
of
conversation
with
the
sex
,
that
the
hangman
,
quickening
his
steps
,
now
hastened
into
their
society
,
cursing
the
amorous
natures
of
Hugh
and
Mr
Tappertit
with
great
heartiness
,
at
every
step
he
took
.
  
<EOS>
When
be
entered
the
miserable
room
in
which
they
were
confined
,
Dolly
and
Miss
Haredale
withdrew
in
silence
to
the
remotest
corner
.
<EOS>
But
Miss
Miggs
,
who
was
particularly
tender
of
her
reputation
,
immediately
fell
upon
her
knees
and
began
to
scream
very
loud
,
crying
,
"
What
will
become
of
me
!
"
<EOS>
---
"
Where
is
my
Simmuns
!
"
<EOS>
---
"
Have
mercy
,
good
gentlemen
,
on
my
sex
's
weaknesses
!
"
<EOS>
---
with
other
doleful
lamentations
of
that
nature
,
which
she
delivered
with
great
propriety
and
decorum
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
,
miss
,
"
whispered
Dennis
,
beckoning
to
her
with
his
forefinger
,
"
come
here
---
I
wo
n't
hurt
you
.
 
<EOS>
Come
here
,
my
lamb
,
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
On
hearing
this
tender
epithet
,
Miss
Miggs
,
who
had
left
off
screaming
when
he
opened
his
lips
,
and
had
listened
to
him
attentively
,
began
again
,
crying
:
"
<EOS>
Oh
I
'm
his
lamb
!
 
<EOS>
He
says
I
'm
his
lamb
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
gracious
<EOS>
,
why
was
n't
I
born
old
and
ugly
!
 
<EOS>
Why
was
I
ever
made
to
be
the
youngest
of
six
,
and
all
of
'em
dead
and
in
their
blessed
graves
,
excepting
one
married
sister
,
which
is
settled
in
Golden
Lion
Court
,
number
twenty
-
sivin
,
second
bell
-
handle
on
the
---
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
I
say
I
an't
a
-
going
to
hurt
you
?
"
<EOS>
said
Dennis
,
pointing
to
a
chair
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
miss
,
what
's
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
may
n't
be
the
matter
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Miss
Miggs
,
clasping
her
hands
distractedly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Anything
may
be
the
matter
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
nothing
is
,
I
tell
you
,
"
said
the
hangman
.
 
<EOS>
"
First
stop
that
noise
and
come
and
sit
down
here
,
will
you
,
chuckey
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
coaxing
tone
in
which
he
said
these
latter
words
might
have
failed
in
its
object
,
if
he
had
not
accompanied
them
with
sundry
sharp
jerks
of
his
thumb
over
one
shoulder
,
and
with
divers
winks
and
thrustings
of
his
tongue
into
his
cheek
,
from
which
signals
the
damsel
gathered
that
he
sought
to
speak
to
her
apart
,
concerning
Miss
Haredale
and
Dolly
.
 
<EOS>
Her
curiosity
being
very
powerful
,
and
her
jealousy
by
no
means
<EOS>
inactive
,
she
arose
,
and
with
a
great
deal
of
shivering
and
starting
back
,
and
much
muscular
action
among
all
the
small
bones
in
her
throat
,
gradually
approached
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
,
"
said
the
hangman
.
  
<EOS>
Suiting
the
action
to
the
word
,
he
thrust
her
rather
suddenly
and
prematurely
into
a
chair
,
and
designing
to
reassure
her
by
a
little
harmless
jocularity
,
such
as
is
adapted
to
please
and
fascinate
the
sex
,
converted
his
right
forefinger
into
an
ideal
bradawl
or
gimlet
,
and
made
as
though
he
would
screw
the
same
into
her
side
---
 
whereat
Miss
Miggs
shrieked
again
,
and
evinced
symptoms
of
faintness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lovey
,
my
dear
,
"
whispered
Dennis
,
drawing
his
chair
close
to
hers
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
was
your
young
man
here
last
,
eh
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
MY
young
man
,
good
gentleman
!
"
answered
Miggs
in
a
tone
of
exquisite
distress
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
Simmuns
,
you
know
---
him
?
"
said
Dennis
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mine
indeed
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Miggs
,
with
a
burst
of
bitterness
---
<EOS>
and
as
she
said
it
,
she
glanced
towards
Dolly
.
 
<EOS>
"
MINE
,
good
gentleman
!
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
just
what
Mr
Dennis
wanted
,
and
expected
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
looking
so
soothingly
,
not
to
say
amorously
on
Miggs
,
that
she
sat
,
as
she
afterwards
remarked
,
on
pins
and
needles
of
the
sharpest
Whitechapel
kind
,
not
knowing
what
intentions
might
be
suggesting
that
expression
to
his
features
:
"
I
was
afraid
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
as
much
myself
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
her
fault
.
 
<EOS>
She
WILL
entice
'
em
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
n't
,
"
cried
Miggs
,
folding
her
hands
and
looking
upwards
with
a
kind
of
devout
blankness
,
"
I
would
n't
lay
myself
out
as
she
does
;
I
would
n't
be
as
bold
as
her
;
I
would
n't
seem
to
say
to
all
male
creeturs
"
Come
and
kiss
me
"
"
---
and
here
a
shudder
quite
convulsed
her
frame
---
"
for
any
earthly
crowns
as
might
be
offered
.
<EOS>
Worlds
,
"
Miggs
added
solemnly
,
"
should
not
reduce
me
.
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
Not
if
I
was
Wenis
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
you
ARE
Wenus
,
you
know
,
"
said
Mr
Dennis
,
confidentially
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
am
not
,
good
gentleman
,
"
answered
Miggs
,
shaking
her
head
with
an
air
of
self
-
denial
which
seemed
to
imply
that
she
might
be
if
she
chose
,
but
she
hoped
she
knew
better
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
am
not
,
good
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
charge
me
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Up
to
this
time
she
had
turned
round
,
every
now
and
then
,
to
where
Dolly
and
Miss
Haredale
had
retired
and
uttered
a
scream
,
or
groan
,
or
laid
her
hand
upon
her
heart
and
trembled
excessively
,
with
a
view
of
keeping
up
appearances
,
and
giving
them
to
understand
that
she
conversed
with
the
visitor
,
under
protest
and
on
compulsion
,
and
at
a
great
personal
sacrifice
,
for
their
common
good
.
 
<EOS>
But
at
this
point
,
Mr
Dennis
looked
so
very
full
of
meaning
,
and
gave
such
a
singularly
expressive
twitch
to
his
face
as
a
request
to
her
to
come
still
nearer
to
him
,
that
she
abandoned
these
little
arts
,
and
gave
him
her
whole
and
undivided
attention
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
was
Simmuns
here
,
I
say
?
"
<EOS>
quoth
Dennis
,
in
her
ear
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
since
yesterday
morning
;
and
then
only
for
a
few
minutes
.
 
<EOS>
Not
all
day
,
the
day
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
he
meant
all
along
to
carry
off
that
one
!
"
<EOS>
said
Dennis
,
indicating
Dolly
by
the
slightest
possible
jerk
of
his
head
:
---
"
And
to
hand
you
over
to
somebody
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Miggs
,
who
had
fallen
into
a
terrible
state
of
grief
when
the
first
part
of
this
sentence
was
spoken
,
recovered
a
little
at
the
second
,
and
seemed
by
the
sudden
check
she
put
upon
her
tears
,
to
intimate
that
possibly
this
arrangement
might
meet
her
views
;
and
that
it
might
,
perhaps
,
remain
an
open
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
---
But
unfort'nately
,
"
pursued
Dennis
,
who
observed
this
:
"
somebody
else
was
fond
of
her
too
,
you
see
;
and
even
if
he
was
n't
,
somebody
else
is
took
for
a
rioter
,
and
it
's
all
over
with
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Miggs
relapsed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
I
want
,
"
said
Dennis
,
"
to
clear
this
house
,
and
to
see
you
righted
.
 
<EOS>
What
if
I
was
to
get
her
off
,
out
of
the
way
,
eh
?
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Miggs
,
brightening
again
,
rejoined
,
with
many
breaks
and
pauses
from
excess
of
feeling
,
that
temptations
had
been
Simmuns
's
bane
.
 
<EOS>
That
it
was
not
his
faults
,
but
hers
(
meaning
Dolly
's
)
.
<EOS>
That
men
did
not
see
through
these
dreadful
arts
as
women
did
,
and
therefore
was
caged
and
trapped
,
as
Simmun
had
been
.
 
<EOS>
That
she
had
no
personal
motives
to
serve
---
far
from
it
---
on
the
contrary
,
her
intentions
was
good
towards
all
parties
.
 
<EOS>
But
forasmuch
as
she
knowed
that
Simmun
,
if
united
to
any
designing
and
artful
minxes
(
she
would
name
no
names
,
<EOS>
for
that
was
not
her
dispositions
)
---
to
ANY
designing
and
artful
minxes
---
must
be
made
miserable
and
unhappy
for
life
,
she
DID
incline
towards
prewentions
.
 
<EOS>
Such
,
she
added
,
was
her
free
confessions
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
this
was
private
feelings
,
and
might
perhaps
be
looked
upon
as
wengeance
,
she
begged
the
gentleman
would
say
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
he
said
,
wishing
to
do
her
duty
by
all
mankind
,
even
by
them
as
had
ever
been
her
bitterest
enemies
,
she
would
not
listen
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
With
that
she
stopped
her
ears
,
and
shook
her
head
from
side
to
side
,
to
intimate
to
Mr
Dennis
that
though
he
talked
until
he
had
no
breath
left
,
she
was
as
deaf
as
any
adder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lookee
here
,
my
sugar
-
stick
,
"
said
Mr
Dennis
,
"
if
your
view
's
the
same
as
mine
,
and
you
'll
only
be
quiet
and
slip
away
at
the
right
time
,
I
can
have
the
house
clear
to
-
morrow
,
and
be
out
of
this
trouble
.
<EOS>
---
Stop
though
!
<EOS>
there
's
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Which
other
,
sir
?
"
asked
Miggs
---
still
with
her
fingers
in
her
ears
and
her
head
shaking
obstinately
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
the
tallest
one
,
yonder
,
"
said
Dennis
,
as
he
stroked
his
chin
,
and
added
,
in
an
undertone
to
himself
,
something
about
not
crossing
Muster
Gashford
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Miggs
replied
(
still
being
profoundly
deaf
)
that
if
Miss
Haredale
stood
in
the
way
at
all
,
he
might
make
himself
quite
easy
on
that
score
;
as
she
had
gathered
,
from
what
passed
between
Hugh
and
Mr
Tappertit
when
they
were
last
there
,
that
she
was
to
be
removed
alone
(
not
by
them
,
but
by
somebody
else
)
,
to
-
morrow
night
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dennis
opened
his
eyes
very
wide
at
this
piece
of
information
,
whistled
once
,
considered
once
,
and
finally
slapped
his
head
once
and
nodded
once
,
as
if
he
had
got
the
clue
to
this
mysterious
removal
,
and
so
dismissed
it
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
imparted
his
design
concerning
Dolly
to
Miss
Miggs
,
who
was
taken
more
deaf
than
before
,
when
he
began
;
and
so
remained
,
all
through
.
  
<EOS>
The
notable
scheme
was
this
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dennis
was
immediately
to
seek
out
from
among
the
rioters
,
some
daring
young
fellow
(
and
he
had
one
in
his
eye
,
he
said
)
,
who
,
terrified
by
the
threats
he
could
hold
out
to
him
,
and
alarmed
by
the
capture
of
so
many
who
were
no
better
and
no
worse
than
he
,
would
gladly
avail
himself
of
any
help
to
get
abroad
,
and
out
of
harm
's
way
,
with
his
plunder
,
even
though
his
journey
were
incumbered
by
an
unwilling
companion
;
indeed
,
the
unwilling
companion
being
a
beautiful
girl
,
would
probably
be
an
additional
inducement
and
temptation
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
person
found
,
he
proposed
to
bring
him
there
on
the
ensuing
night
,
when
the
tall
one
was
taken
off
,
and
Miss
Miggs
had
purposely
retired
;
and
then
that
Dolly
should
be
gagged
,
muffled
in
a
cloak
,
and
carried
in
any
handy
conveyance
down
to
the
river
's
side
;
where
there
were
abundant
means
of
getting
her
smuggled
snugly
off
in
any
small
craft
of
doubtful
character
,
and
<EOS>
no
questions
asked
.
 
<EOS>
With
regard
to
the
expense
of
this
removal
,
he
would
say
,
at
a
rough
calculation
,
that
two
or
three
silver
tea
or
coffee
-
pots
,
with
something
additional
for
drink
(
such
as
a
muffineer
,
or
toast
-
rack
)
,
would
more
than
cover
it
.
 
<EOS>
Articles
of
plate
of
every
kind
having
been
buried
by
the
rioters
in
several
lonely
parts
of
London
,
and
particularly
,
as
he
knew
,
in
St
James
's
Square
,
which
,
though
easy
of
access
,
was
little
frequented
after
dark
,
and
had
a
convenient
piece
of
water
in
the
midst
,
the
needful
funds
were
close
at
hand
,
and
could
be
had
upon
the
shortest
notice
.
 
<EOS>
With
regard
to
Dolly
,
the
gentleman
would
exercise
his
own
discretion
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
bound
to
do
nothing
but
to
take
her
away
,
and
keep
her
away
.
 
<EOS>
All
other
arrangements
and
dispositions
would
rest
entirely
with
himself
.
  
<EOS>
If
Miss
Miggs
had
had
her
hearing
,
no
doubt
she
would
have
been
greatly
shocked
by
the
indelicacy
of
a
young
female
's
<EOS>
going
away
with
a
stranger
by
night
(
for
her
moral
feelings
,
as
we
have
said
,
were
of
the
tenderest
kind
)
;
but
directly
Mr
Dennis
ceased
to
speak
,
she
reminded
him
that
he
had
only
wasted
breath
.
 
<EOS>
She
then
went
on
to
say
(
still
with
her
fingers
in
her
ears
)
that
nothing
less
than
a
severe
practical
lesson
would
save
the
locksmith
's
daughter
from
utter
ruin
;
and
that
she
felt
it
,
as
it
were
,
a
moral
obligation
and
a
sacred
duty
to
the
family
,
to
wish
that
some
one
would
devise
one
for
her
reformation
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Miggs
remarked
,
and
very
justly
,
as
an
abstract
sentiment
which
happened
to
occur
to
her
at
the
moment
,
that
she
dared
to
say
the
locksmith
and
his
wife
would
murmur
,
and
repine
,
if
they
were
ever
,
by
forcible
abduction
,
or
otherwise
,
to
lose
their
child
;
but
that
we
seldom
knew
,
in
this
world
,
what
was
best
for
us
:
<EOS>
such
being
our
sinful
and
imperfect
natures
,
that
very
few
arrived
at
that
clear
understanding
.
  
<EOS>
Having
brought
their
conversation
to
this
satisfactory
end
,
they
parted
:
Dennis
,
to
pursue
his
design
,
and
take
another
walk
about
his
farm
;
Miss
Miggs
,
to
launch
,
when
he
left
her
,
into
such
a
burst
of
mental
anguish
(
which
she
gave
them
to
understand
was
occasioned
by
certain
tender
things
he
had
had
the
presumption
and
audacity
to
say
)
,
that
little
Dolly
's
heart
was
quite
melted
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
she
said
and
did
so
much
to
soothe
the
outraged
feelings
of
Miss
Miggs
,
and
looked
so
beautiful
while
doing
so
,
that
if
that
young
maid
had
not
had
ample
vent
for
her
surpassing
spite
,
in
a
knowledge
of
the
mischief
that
was
brewing
,
she
must
have
scratched
her
features
,
on
the
spot
.

Chapter
71
    
<EOS>
All
next
day
,
Emma
Haredale
,
Dolly
,
and
Miggs
,
remained
cooped
up
together
in
what
had
now
been
their
prison
for
so
many
days
,
without
seeing
any
person
,
or
hearing
any
sound
but
the
murmured
conversation
,
in
an
outer
room
,
of
the
men
who
kept
watch
over
them
.
 
<EOS>
There
appeared
to
be
more
of
these
fellows
than
there
had
been
hitherto
;
and
they
could
no
longer
hear
the
voices
of
women
,
which
they
had
before
plainly
distinguished
.
 
<EOS>
Some
new
excitement
,
too
,
seemed
to
prevail
among
them
;
for
there
was
much
stealthy
going
in
and
out
,
and
a
constant
questioning
of
those
who
were
newly
arrived
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
previously
been
quite
reckless
in
their
behaviour
;
often
making
a
great
uproar
;
quarrelling
among
themselves
,
fighting
,
dancing
,
and
singing
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
now
very
subdued
and
silent
,
conversing
almost
in
whispers
,
and
stealing
in
and
out
with
a
soft
and
stealthy
tread
,
very
different
from
the
boisterous
trampling
<EOS>
in
which
their
arrivals
and
departures
had
hitherto
been
announced
to
the
trembling
captives
.
  
<EOS>
Whether
this
change
was
occasioned
by
the
presence
among
them
of
some
person
of
authority
in
their
ranks
,
or
by
any
other
cause
,
they
were
unable
to
decide
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
they
thought
it
was
in
part
attributable
to
there
being
a
sick
man
in
the
chamber
,
<EOS>
for
last
night
there
had
been
a
shuffling
of
feet
,
as
though
a
burden
were
brought
in
,
and
afterwards
a
moaning
noise
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
had
no
means
of
ascertaining
the
truth
:
for
any
question
or
entreaty
on
their
parts
only
provoked
a
storm
of
execrations
,
or
something
worse
;
and
they
were
too
happy
to
be
left
alone
,
unassailed
by
threats
or
admiration
,
to
risk
even
that
comfort
,
by
any
voluntary
communication
with
those
who
held
them
in
durance
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
sufficiently
evident
,
both
to
Emma
and
to
the
locksmith
's
poor
little
daughter
herself
,
that
she
,
Dolly
,
was
the
great
object
of
attraction
;
and
that
so
soon
as
they
should
have
leisure
to
indulge
in
the
softer
passion
,
Hugh
and
Mr
Tappertit
would
certainly
fall
to
blows
for
her
sake
;
in
which
latter
case
,
it
was
not
very
difficult
to
see
whose
prize
she
would
become
.
 
<EOS>
With
all
her
old
horror
of
that
man
revived
,
and
deepened
into
a
degree
of
aversion
and
abhorrence
which
no
language
can
describe
;
with
a
thousand
old
recollections
and
regrets
,
and
causes
of
distress
,
anxiety
,
and
fear
,
besetting
her
on
all
sides
;
poor
Dolly
Varden
---
 
<EOS>
sweet
,
blooming
,
buxom
Dolly
---
began
to
hang
her
head
,
and
fade
,
and
droop
,
like
a
beautiful
flower
.
 
<EOS>
The
colour
fled
from
her
cheeks
,
her
courage
forsook
her
,
her
gentle
heart
failed
.
 
<EOS>
Unmindful
of
all
her
provoking
caprices
,
forgetful
of
all
her
conquests
and
inconstancy
,
with
all
her
winning
little
vanities
quite
gone
<EOS>
,
she
nestled
all
the
livelong
day
in
Emma
Haredale
's
bosom
;
and
,
sometimes
calling
on
her
dear
old
grey
-
haired
father
,
sometimes
on
her
mother
,
and
sometimes
even
on
her
old
home
,
pined
slowly
away
,
like
a
poor
bird
in
its
cage
.
  
<EOS>
Light
hearts
,
light
hearts
,
that
float
so
gaily
on
a
smooth
stream
,
that
are
so
sparkling
and
buoyant
in
the
sunshine
---
down
upon
fruit
,
bloom
upon
flowers
,
blush
in
summer
air
,
life
of
the
winged
insect
,
whose
whole
existence
is
a
day
---
<EOS>
how
soon
ye
sink
in
troubled
water
!
<EOS>
Poor
Dolly
's
heart
---
a
little
,
gentle
,
idle
,
fickle
thing
;
giddy
,
restless
,
fluttering
;
constant
to
nothing
but
bright
looks
,
and
smiles
and
laughter
---
Dolly
's
heart
was
breaking
.
  
<EOS>
Emma
had
known
grief
,
and
could
bear
it
better
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
little
comfort
to
impart
,
but
she
could
soothe
and
tend
her
,
and
she
did
so
;
and
Dolly
clung
to
her
like
a
child
to
its
nurse
.
 
<EOS>
In
endeavouring
to
inspire
her
with
some
fortitude
,
she
increased
her
own
;
and
though
the
nights
were
long
,
and
the
days
dismal
,
and
she
felt
the
wasting
influence
of
watching
and
fatigue
,
and
had
perhaps
a
more
defined
and
clear
perception
of
their
destitute
condition
and
its
worst
dangers
<EOS>
,
she
uttered
no
complaint
.
 
<EOS>
Before
the
ruffians
,
in
whose
power
they
were
,
she
bore
herself
so
calmly
,
and
with
such
an
appearance
,
in
the
midst
of
all
her
terror
,
of
a
secret
conviction
that
they
dared
not
harm
her
,
that
there
was
not
a
man
among
them
but
held
her
in
some
degree
of
dread
;
and
more
than
one
believed
she
had
a
weapon
hidden
in
her
dress
,
and
was
prepared
to
use
it
.
  
<EOS>
Such
was
their
condition
when
they
were
joined
by
Miss
Miggs
,
who
gave
them
to
understand
that
she
too
had
been
taken
prisoner
because
of
her
charms
,
and
detailed
such
feats
of
resistance
she
had
performed
(
her
virtue
having
given
her
supernatural
strength
)
,
that
they
felt
it
quite
a
happiness
to
have
her
for
a
champion
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
this
the
only
comfort
they
derived
at
first
from
Miggs
's
presence
and
society
:
for
that
young
lady
displayed
such
resignation
and
long
-
suffering
,
and
so
much
meek
endurance
,
under
her
trials
,
and
breathed
in
all
her
chaste
discourse
a
spirit
of
such
holy
confidence
and
resignation
,
and
devout
belief
that
all
would
happen
for
the
best
,
that
Emma
felt
her
courage
strengthened
by
the
bright
example
;
never
doubting
but
that
everything
she
said
was
true
,
and
that
she
,
like
them
,
was
torn
from
all
she
loved
,
and
agonised
by
doubt
and
apprehension
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
poor
Dolly
,
she
was
roused
,
at
first
,
by
seeing
one
who
came
from
home
;
but
when
she
heard
under
what
circumstances
she
had
left
it
,
and
into
whose
hands
her
father
had
fallen
,
she
wept
more
bitterly
than
ever
,
and
refused
all
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Miggs
was
at
some
trouble
to
reprove
her
for
this
state
of
mind
,
and
to
entreat
her
to
take
example
by
herself
,
who
,
she
said
,
was
now
receiving
back
,
with
interest
,
tenfold
the
amount
of
her
subscriptions
to
the
red
-
brick
dwelling
-
house
,
in
the
articles
of
peace
of
mind
and
a
quiet
conscience
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
while
on
serious
topics
,
Miss
Miggs
considered
it
her
duty
to
try
her
hand
at
the
conversion
of
Miss
Haredale
;
for
whose
improvement
she
launched
into
a
polemical
address
of
some
length
,
in
the
course
whereof
,
she
likened
herself
unto
a
chosen
missionary
,
and
that
young
lady
to
a
cannibal
in
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
she
returned
so
often
to
these
sublects
,
and
so
frequently
called
upon
them
to
take
a
lesson
from
her
,
---
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
vaunting
and
,
as
it
were
,
rioting
in
,
her
huge
unworthiness
,
and
abundant
excess
of
sin
,
---
that
,
in
the
course
of
a
short
time
,
she
became
,
in
that
small
chamber
,
rather
a
nuisance
than
a
comfort
,
and
rendered
them
,
if
possible
,
even
more
unhappy
than
they
had
been
before
.
  
<EOS>
The
night
had
now
come
;
and
for
the
first
time
(
for
their
jailers
had
been
regular
in
bringing
food
and
candles
)
,
they
were
left
in
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
Any
change
in
their
condition
in
such
a
place
inspired
new
fears
;
and
when
some
hours
had
passed
,
and
the
gloom
was
still
unbroken
,
Emma
could
no
longer
repress
her
alarm
.
  
<EOS>
They
listened
attentively
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
the
same
murmuring
in
the
outer
room
,
and
now
and
then
a
moan
which
seemed
to
be
wrung
from
a
person
in
great
pain
,
who
made
an
effort
to
subdue
it
,
but
could
not
.
 
<EOS>
Even
these
men
seemed
to
be
in
darkness
too
;
for
no
light
shone
through
the
chinks
in
the
door
,
nor
were
they
moving
,
as
their
custom
was
,
but
quite
still
:
the
silence
being
unbroken
by
so
much
as
the
creaking
of
a
board
.
  
<EOS>
At
first
,
Miss
Miggs
wondered
greatly
in
her
own
mind
who
this
sick
person
might
be
;
but
arriving
,
on
second
thoughts
,
at
the
conclusion
that
he
was
a
part
of
the
schemes
on
foot
,
and
an
artful
device
soon
to
be
employed
with
great
success
,
she
opined
,
for
Miss
Haredale
's
comfort
,
that
it
must
be
some
misguided
Papist
who
had
been
wounded
:
and
this
happy
supposition
encouraged
her
to
say
,
under
her
breath
,
"
Ally
Looyer
!
"
<EOS>
several
times
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
possible
,
"
said
Emma
,
with
some
indignation
,
"
that
you
who
have
seen
these
men
committing
the
outrages
you
have
told
us
of
,
and
who
have
fallen
into
their
hands
,
like
us
,
can
exult
in
their
cruelties
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Personal
considerations
,
miss
,
"
rejoined
Miggs
<EOS>
,
"
sinks
into
nothing
,
<EOS>
afore
a
noble
cause
.
 
<EOS>
Ally
Looyer
!
 
<EOS>
Ally
Looyer
!
 
<EOS>
Ally
Looyer
,
good
gentlemen
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
seemed
from
the
shrill
pertinacity
with
which
Miss
Miggs
repeated
this
form
of
acclamation
,
that
she
was
calling
the
same
through
the
keyhole
of
the
door
;
but
in
the
profound
darkness
she
could
not
be
seen

Having
delivered
these
ironical
passages
with
a
most
wonderful
volubility
,
and
with
a
shrillness
perfectly
deafening
(
especially
when
she
jerked
out
the
interjections
)
,
Miss
Miggs
,
from
mere
habit
,
and
not
because
weeping
was
at
all
appropriate
to
the
occasion
,
which
was
one
of
triumph
,
concluded
by
bursting
into
a
flood
of
tears
,
and
calling
in
an
impassioned
manner
on
the
name
of
Simmuns
.
  
<EOS>
What
Emma
Haredale
and
Dolly
would
have
done
,
or
<EOS>
how
long
Miss
Miggs
,
now
that
she
had
hoisted
her
true
colours
,
would
have
gone
on
waving
them
before
their
astonished
senses
,
it
is
impossible
to
tell
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
is
it
necessary
to
speculate
on
these
matters
,
for
a
startling
interruption
occurred
at
that
moment
,
which
took
their
whole
attention
by
storm
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
a
violent
knocking
at
the
door
of
the
house
,
and
then
its
sudden
bursting
open
;
which
was
immediately
succeeded
by
a
scuffle
in
the
room
without
,
and
the
clash
of
weapons
.
 
<EOS>
Transported
with
the
hope
that
rescue
had
at
length
arrived
,
Emma
and
Dolly
shrieked
aloud
for
help
;
nor
were
their
shrieks
unanswered
;
for
after
a
hurried
interval
,
a
man
,
bearing
in
one
hand
a
drawn
sword
,
and
in
the
other
a
taper
,
rushed
into
the
chamber
where
they
were
confined
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
some
check
upon
their
transport
to
find
in
this
person
an
entire
stranger
,
but
they
appealed
to
him
,
nevertheless
,
and
besought
him
,
in
impassioned
language
,
to
restore
them
to
their
friends
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
what
other
purpose
am
I
here
?
"
he
answered
,
closing
the
door
,
and
standing
with
his
back
against
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
With
what
object
have
I
made
my
way
to
this
place
,
through
difficulty
and
danger
,
but
to
preserve
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
With
a
joy
for
which
it
was
impossible
to
find
adequate
expression
,
they
embraced
each
other
,
and
thanked
Heaven
for
this
most
timely
aid
.
 
<EOS>
Their
deliverer
stepped
forward
for
a
moment
to
put
the
light
upon
the
table
,
and
immediately
returning
to
his
former
position
against
the
door
,
bared
his
head
,
and
looked
on
smilingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
news
of
my
uncle
,
sir
?
"
said
Emma
,
turning
hastily
towards
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
of
my
father

mother
?
"
added
Dolly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes

"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
news

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
alive

unhurt

<EOS>
"
they
both
cried
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
and
unhurt
,
"
he
rejoined
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
close
at
hand
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
say
close
at
hand
,
"
he
answered
smoothly
;
"
they
are
at
no
great
distance
.
 
<EOS>
YOUR
friends
,
sweet
one
,
"
he
added
,
addressing
Dolly
,
"
are
within
a
few
hours
'
journey

<EOS>
You
will
be
restored

night

<EOS>
"
My

faltered
Emma
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
uncle
,
dear
Miss
Haredale
,
happily
---
I
say
happily
,
because
he
has
succeeded
where
many
of
our
creed
have
failed
,
and
is
safe
---
has
crossed
the
sea
,
and
is
out
of
Britain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thank
God
for
it
,
"
said
Emma
,
faintly
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
say
well
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
reason
to
be
thankful
:
greater
reason
than
it
is
possible
for
you
,
who
have
seen
but
one
night
of
these
cruel
outrages
,
to
imagine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Does
he
desire
,
"
said
Emma
,
"
that
I
should
follow
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
ask
if
he
desires
it
?
"
cried
the
stranger
in
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
IF
he
desires
it
!
 
<EOS>
But
you
do
not
know
the
danger
of
remaining
in
England
,
the
difficulty
of
escape
,
or
the
price
hundreds
would
pay
to
secure
the
means
,
when
you
make
that
inquiry
.
 
<EOS>
Pardon
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
forgotten
that
you
could
not
,
being
prisoner
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
gather
,
sir
,
"
said
Emma
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
"
from
what
you
hint
at
,
but
fear
to
tell
me
,
that
I
have
witnessed
but
the
beginning
,
and
the
least
,
of
the
violence
to
which
we
are
exposed
,
and
that
it
has
not
yet
slackened
in
its
fury
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
shook
his
head
,
lifted
up
his
hands
;
and
with
the
same
smooth
smile
,
which
was
not
a
pleasant
one
to
see
,
cast
his
eyes
upon
the
ground
,
and
remained
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
venture
,
sir
,
to
speak
plain
,
"
said
Emma
,
"
and
to
tell
me
the
worst
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
undergone
some
preparation
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
here
Dolly
interposed
,
and
entreated
her
not
to
hear
the
worst
,
but
the
best
;
and
besought
the
gentleman
to
tell
them
the
best
,
and
to
keep
the
remainder
of
his
news
until
they
were
safe
among
their
friends
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
told
in
three
words
,
"
he
said
,
glancing
at
the
locksmith
's
daughter
with
a
look
of
some
displeasure
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
people
have
risen
,
to
a
man
,
against
us
;
the
streets
are
filled
with
soldiers
,
who
support
them
and
do
their
bidding
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
no
protection
but
from
above
,
and
no
safety
but
in
flight
;
and
that
is
a
poor
resource
;
for
we
are
watched
on
every
hand
,
and
detained
here
,
both
by
force
and
fraud
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Haredale
,
I
can
not
bear
---
believe
me
,
that
I
can
not
bear
---
by
speaking
of
myself
,
or
what
I
have
done
,
or
am
prepared
to
do
,
to
seem
to
vaunt
my
services
before
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
having
powerful
Protestant
connections
,
and
having
my
whole
wealth
embarked
with
theirs
in
shipping
and
commerce
,
I
happily
possessed
the
means
of
saving
your
uncle
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
the
means
of
saving
you
;
and
in
redemption
of
my
sacred
promise
,
made
to
him
,
I
am
here
;
pledged
not
to
leave
you
until
I
have
placed
you
in
his
arms
.
 
<EOS>
The
treachery
or
penitence
of
one
of
the
men
about
you
,
led
to
the
discovery
of
your
place
of
confinement
;
and
that
I
have
forced
my
way
here
,
sword
in
hand
,
you
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
bring
,
"
said
Emma
,
faltering
,
"
<EOS>
some
note
or
token
from
my
uncle
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
he
does
n't
,
"
cried
Dolly
,
pointing
at
him
earnestly
;
"
<EOS>
now
I
am
sure
he
does
n't
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
go
with
him
for
the
world
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
pretty
fool
---
be
silent
,
"
he
replied
,
frowning
angrily
upon
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
Miss
Haredale
,
I
have
no
letter
,
nor
any
token
of
any
kind
;
for
while
I
sympathise
with
you
,
and
such
as
you
,
on
whom
misfortune
so
heavy
and
so
undeserved
has
fallen
,
I
value
my
life
.
<EOS>
I
carry
,
therefore
,
no
writing
which
,
found
upon
me
,
would
lead
to
its
certain
loss
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
thought
of
bringing
any
other
token
,
nor
did
Mr
Haredale
think
of
entrusting
me
with
one
---
possibly
because
he
had
good
experience
of
my
faith
and
honesty
,
and
owed
his
life
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
reproof
conveyed
in
these
words
,
which
to
a
nature
like
Emma
Haredale
's
,
was
well
addressed
.
 
<EOS>
But
Dolly
,
who
was
differently
constituted
,
was
by
no
means
touched
by
it
,
and
still
conjured
her
,
in
all
the
terms
of
affection
and
attachment
she
could
think
of
,
not
to
be
lured
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
Time
presses
,
"
said
their
visitor
,
who
,
although
he
sought
to
express
the
deepest
interest
,
had
something
cold
and
even
in
his
speech
,
that
grated
on
the
ear
;
"
and
danger
surrounds
us
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
have
exposed
myself
to
it
,
in
vain
,
let
it
be
so
;
but
if
you
and
he
should
ever
meet
again
,
do
me
justice
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
decide
to
remain
(
as
I
think
you
do
)
,
remember
,
Miss
Haredale
,
that
I
left
you
with
a
solemn
caution
,
and
acquitting
myself
of
all
the
consequences
to
which
you
expose
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Stay
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Emma
---
one
moment
<EOS>
,
I
beg
you
.
 
<EOS>
Can
not
we
---
and
she
drew
Dolly
closer
to
her
---
"
can
not
we
go
together
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
task
of
conveying
one
female
in
safety
through
such
scenes
as
we
must
encounter
,
to
say
nothing
of
attracting
the
attention
of
those
who
crowd
the
streets
,
"
he
answered
,
"
is
enough
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
said
that
she
will
be
restored
to
her
friends
to
-
night

<EOS>
If
you
accept
the
service
I
tender
,
Miss
Haredale
,
she
shall
be
instantly
placed
in
safe
conduct
,
and
that
promise
redeemed

<EOS>
Do
you
decide
to
remain
?
 
<EOS>
People
of
all
ranks
and
creeds
are
flying
from
the
town

which
is
sacked
from
end
to
end

<EOS>
Let
me
be
of
use
in
some
quarter
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
stay
,
or
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dolly
,
"
said
Emma
,
in
a
hurried
manner
,
"
my
dear
girl
,
this
is
our
last
hope

<EOS>
If
we
part
now

it
is
only

we
may
meet
again
in
happiness
and
honour

<EOS>
I
will
trust
to
this
gentleman

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
no
-
no

"
cried
Dolly
,
clinging
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
pray
,
do
not
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
hear
,
"
said
Emma
,
"
that
to
-
night
---
only
to
-
night
---
within
a
few
hours
---
think
of
that

<EOS>
---
you
will
be
among
those
who
would
die
of
grief
to
lose
you
,
and
who
are
now
plunged
in
the
deepest
misery
for
your
sake
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
for
me
,
dear
girl
,
as
I
will
for
you
;
and
never
forget
the
many
quiet
hours
we
have
passed
together
.
 
<EOS>
Say
one
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
Say
that
at
parting
!
"
  
<EOS>
But
Dolly
could
say
nothing
;
no
,
not
when
Emma
kissed
her
cheek
a
hundred
times
,
and
covered
it
with
tears
,
could
she
do
more
than
hang
upon
her
neck
,
and
sob
,
and
clasp
,
and
hold
her
tight
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
time
for
no
more
of
this
,
"
cried
the
man
,
unclenching
her
hands
,
and
pushing
her
roughly
off
,
as
he
drew
Emma
Haredale
towards
the
door
:
"
Now
!
 
<EOS>
Quick
,
outside
there
!
<EOS>
are
you
ready
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
"
cried
a
loud
voice
,
which
made
him
start
.
 
<EOS>
"
Quite
ready
!
<EOS>
Stand
back
here
,
for
your
lives
!
"
  
<EOS>
And
in
an
instant
he
was
felled
like
an
ox
in
the
butcher
's
shambles
---
struck
down
as
though
a
block
of
marble
had
fallen
from
the
roof
and
crushed
him
---
and
cheerful
light
,
and
beaming
faces
came
pouring
in
---
and
Emma
was
clasped
in
her
uncle
's
embrace
,
and
Dolly
,
with
a
shriek
that
pierced
the
air
,
fell
into
the
arms
of
her
father
and
mother
.
  
<EOS>
What
fainting
there
was
,
<EOS>
what
laughing
,
what
crying
,
what
sobbing

what
smiling

how
much
questioning

no

all
talking
together
,
all
beside
themselves
with
joy
;
what
kissing
,
congratulating
,
embracing
,
shaking
of
hands
,
and
falling
into
all
these
raptures
,
over
and
over
and
over
again
;
no
language
can
describe
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
,
and
after
a
long
time
,
the
old
locksmith
went
up
and
fairly
hugged
two
strangers
,
who
had
stood
apart
and
left
them
to
themselves
;
and
then
they
saw
---
whom
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
Edward
Chester
and
Joseph
Willet
.
  
<EOS>
"
See
here
!
"
cried
the
locksmith
.
 
<EOS>
"
See
here
!
<EOS>
where
would
any
of
us
have
been
without
these
two
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
Mr
Edward
,
Mr
Edward
---
<EOS>
oh
,
Joe
,
Joe
,
how
light
,
and
yet
how
full
,
you
have
made
my
old
heart
to
-
night
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
Mr
Edward
that
knocked
him
down
,
sir
,
"
said
Joe
:
"
I
longed
to
do
it
,
but
I
gave
it
up
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
you
brave
and
honest
gentleman
!
 
<EOS>
Get
your
senses
together
,
for
you
have
n't
long
to
lie
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
his
foot
upon
the
breast
of
their
sham
deliverer
,
in
the
absence
of
a
spare
arm
;
and
gave
him
a
gentle
roll
as
he
spoke
.
<EOS>
Gashford
,
for
it
was
no
other
,
crouching
yet
malignant
,
raised
his
scowling
face
,
like
sin
subdued
,
and
pleaded
to
be
gently
used
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
access
to
all
my
lord
's
papers
,
Mr
Haredale
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
submissive
voice
:
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
keeping
his
back
towards
him
,
and
not
once
looking
round
:
"
there
are
very
important
documents
among
them
.
<EOS>
There
are
a
great
many
in
secret
drawers
,
and
distributed
in
various
places
,
known
only
to
my
lord
and
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
give
some
very
valuable
information
,
and
render
important
assistance
to
any
inquiry
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
have
to
answer
it
,
if
I
receive
ill
usage
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pah
!
"
cried
Joe
,
in
deep
disgust
.
 
<EOS>
"
Get
up
,
man
;
you
're
waited
for
,
outside
.
 
<EOS>
Get
up
,
do
you
hear
?
"
  
<EOS>
Gashford
slowly
rose
;
and
picking
up
his
hat
,
and
looking
with
a
baffled
malevolence
,
yet
with
an
air
of
despicable
humility
,
all
round
the
room
,
crawled
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
Joe
,
who
seemed
to
be
the
spokesman
of
the
party
,
for
all
the
rest
were
silent
;
"
the
sooner
we
get
back
to
the
Black
Lion
,
the
better
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
nodded
assent
,
and
drawing
his
niece
's
arm
through
his
,
and
taking
one
of
her
hands
between
his
own
,
passed
out
straightway
;
followed
by
the
locksmith
,
Mrs
Varden
,
and
Dolly
---
who
would
scarcely
have
presented
a
sufficient
surface
for
all
the
hugs
and
caresses
they
bestowed
upon
her
though
she
had
been
a
dozen
Dollys
.
 
<EOS>
Edward
Chester
and
Joe
followed
.
  
<EOS>
And
did
Dolly
never
once
look
behind
---
not
once
?
 
<EOS>
Was
there
not
one
little
fleeting
glimpse
of
the
dark
eyelash
,
almost
resting
on
her
flushed
cheek
,
and
of
the
downcast
sparkling
eye
it
shaded
?
 
<EOS>
Joe
thought
there
was
---
and
he
is
not
likely
to
have
been
mistaken
;
for
there
were
not
many
eyes
like
Dolly
's
,
that
's
the
truth
.
  
<EOS>
The
outer
room
through
which
they
had
to
pass
,
was
full
of
men
;
among
them
,
Mr
Dennis
in
safe
keeping
;
and
there
,
had
been
since
yesterday
,
lying
in
hiding
behind
a
wooden
screen
which
was
now
thrown
down
,
Simon
Tappertit
,
the
recreant
'
prentice
,
burnt
and
bruised
,
and
with
a
gun
-
shot
wound
in
his
body
;
and
his
legs
---
his
perfect
legs
,
the
pride
and
glory
of
his
life
,
the
comfort
of
his
existence
---
crushed
into
shapeless
ugliness
.
 
<EOS>
Wondering
no
longer
at
the
moans
they
had
heard
,
Dolly
kept
closer
to
her
father
,
and
shuddered
at
the
sight
;
but
neither
bruises
,
burns
,
nor
gun
-
shot
wound
,
nor
all
the
torture
of
his
shattered
limbs
,
sent
half
<EOS>
so
keen
a
pang
to
Simon
's
breast
,
as
Dolly
passing
out
,
with
Joe
for
her
preserver
.
  
<EOS>
A
coach
was
ready
at
the
door
,
and
Dolly
found
herself
safe
and
whole
inside
,
between
her
father
and
mother
,
with
Emma
Haredale
and
her
uncle
,
quite
real
,
sitting
opposite
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
Joe
,
no
Edward
;
and
they
had
said
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
only
bowed
once
,
and
kept
at
a
distance
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
heart
!
<EOS>
what
a
long
way
it
was
to
the
Black
Lion
!
    
<EOS>
Chapter
72
    
<EOS>
The
Black
Lion
was
so
far
off
,
and
occupied
such
a
length
of
time
in
the
getting
at
,
that
notwithstanding
the
strong
presumptive
evidence
she
had
about
her
of
the
late
events
being
real
and
of
actual
occurrence
,
Dolly
could
not
divest
herself
of
the
belief
that
she
must
be
in
a
dream
which
was
lasting
all
night
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
she
quite
certain
that
she
saw
and
heard
with
her
own
proper
senses
,
even
when
the
coach
,
in
the
fulness
of
time
,
stopped
at
the
Black
Lion
,
and
the
host
of
that
tavern
approached
in
a
gush
of
cheerful
light
to
help
them
to
dismount
,
and
give
them
hearty
welcome
.
  
<EOS>
There
too
,
at
the
coach
door
,
one
on
one
side
,
one
upon
the
other
,
were
already
Edward
Chester
and
Joe
Willet
,
who
must
have
followed
in
another
coach
:
and
this
was
such
a
strange
and
unaccountable
proceeding
,
that
Dolly
was
the
more
inclined
to
favour
the
idea
of
her
being
fast
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
Mr
Willet
appeared
---
old
John
himself
---
so
heavy
-
headed
and
obstinate
,
and
with
such
a
double
chin
as
the
liveliest
imagination
could
never
in
its
boldest
flights
have
conjured
up
in
all
its
vast
proportions
---
then
she
stood
corrected
,
and
unwillingly
admitted
to
herself
that
she
was
broad
awake
.
  
<EOS>
And
Joe
had
lost
an
arm
---
<EOS>
he
---
that
well
-
made
,
handsome
,
gallant
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
As
Dolly
glanced
towards
him
,
and
thought
of
the
pain
he
must
have
suffered
,
and
the
far
-
off
places
in
which
he
had
been
wandering
,
and
wondered
who
had
been
his
nurse
,
and
hoped
that
whoever
it
was
,
she
had
been
as
kind
and
gentle
and
considerate
as
she
would
have
been
,
the
tears
came
rising
to
her
bright
eyes
,
one
by
one
,
little
by
little
,
until
she
could
keep
them
back
no
longer
,
and
so
before
them
all
,
wept
bitterly
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
all
safe
now
,
Dolly
,
"
said
her
father
,
kindly
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
not
be
separated
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
Cheer
up
,
my
love
,
cheer
up
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
locksmith
's
wife
knew
better
perhaps
,
than
he
,
what
ailed
her
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mrs
Varden
being
quite
an
altered
woman
<EOS>
---
for
the
riots
had
done
that
good
---
added
her
word
to
his
,
and
comforted
her
with
similar
representations
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mayhap
,
"
said
Mr
Willet
,
senior
,
looking
round
upon
the
company
,
"
she
's
hungry
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
what
it
is
,
depend
upon
it
<EOS>
---
I
am
,
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Black
Lion
,
who
,
like
old
John
,
had
been
waiting
supper
past
all
reasonable
and
conscionable
hours
,
hailed
this
as
a
philosophical
discovery
of
the
profoundest
and
most
penetrating
kind
;
and
the
table
being
already
spread
,
they
sat
down
to
supper
straightway
.
  
<EOS>
The
conversation
was
not
of
the
liveliest
nature
,
nor
were
the
appetites
of
some
among
them
very
keen
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
in
both
these
respects
,
old
John
more
than
atoned
for
any
deficiency
on
the
part
of
the
rest
,
and
very
much
distinguished
himself
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
in
point
of
actual
conversation
that
Mr
Willet
shone
so
brilliantly
,
for
he
had
none
of
his
old
cronies
to
"
tackle
,
"
and
was
rather
timorous
of
venturing
on
Joe
;
having
certain
vague
misgivings
within
him
,
that
he
was
ready
on
the
shortest
notice
,
and
on
receipt
of
the
slightest
offence
,
to
fell
the
Black
Lion
to
the
floor
of
his
own
parlour
,
and
immediately
to
withdraw
to
China
or
some
other
remote
and
unknown
region
,
there
to
dwell
for
evermore
,
or
at
least
until
he
had
got
rid
of
his
remaining
arm
and
both
legs
,
and
perhaps
an
eye
or
so
,
into
the
bargain
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
with
a
peculiar
kind
of
pantomime
that
Mr
Willet
filled
up
every
pause
;
and
in
this
he
was
considered
by
the
Black
Lion
,
who
had
been
his
familiar
for
some
years
,
quite
to
surpass
and
go
beyond
himself
,
and
outrun
the
expectations
of
his
most
admiring
friends
.
  
<EOS>
The
subject
that
worked
in
Mr
Willet
's
mind
,
and
occasioned
these
demonstrations
,
was
no
other
than
his
son
's
bodily
disfigurement
,
which
he
had
never
yet
got
himself
thoroughly
to
believe
,
or
comprehend
.
 
<EOS>
Shortly
after
their
first
meeting
,
he
had
been
observed
to
wander
,
in
a
state
of
great
perplexity
,
to
the
kitchen
,
and
to
direct
his
gaze
towards
the
fire
,
as
if
in
search
of
his
usual
adviser
in
all
matters
of
doubt
and
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
being
no
boiler
at
the
Black
Lion
,
and
the
rioters
having
so
beaten
and
battered
his
own
that
it
was
quite
unfit
for
further
service
<EOS>
,
he
wandered
out
again
,
in
a
perfect
bog
of
uncertainty
and
mental
confusion
,
and
in
that
state
took
the
strangest
means
of
resolving
his
doubts
:
such
as
feeling
the
sleeve
of
his
son
's
greatcoat
as
deeming
it
possible
that
his
arm
might
be
there
;
looking
at
his
own
arms
and
those
of
everybody
else
,
as
if
to
assure
himself
that
two
and
not
one
was
the
usual
allowance
;
sitting
by
the
hour
together
in
a
brown
study
,
as
if
he
were
endeavouring
to
recall
Joe
's
image
in
his
younger
days
,
and
to
remember
whether
he
really
had
in
those
times
one
arm
or
a
pair
;
and
employing
himself
in
many
other
speculations
of
the
same
kind
.
  
<EOS>
Finding
himself
at
this
supper
,
surrounded
by
faces
with
which
he
had
been
so
well
acquainted
in
old
times
,
Mr
Willet
recurred
to
the
subject
with
uncommon
vigour
;
apparently
resolved
to
understand
it
now
or
never
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
after
every
two
or
three
mouthfuls
,
he
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
,
and
stared
at
his
son
with
all
his
might
---
particularly
at
his
maimed
side
;
then
,
he
looked
slowly
round
the
table
until
he
caught
some
person
's
eye
,
when
he
shook
his
head
with
great
solemnity
,
patted
his
shoulder
,
winked
,
or
as
one
may
say
---
for
winking
was
a
very
slow
process
with
him
---
went
to
sleep
with
one
eye
for
a
minute
or
two
;
and
so
,
with
another
solemn
shaking
of
his
head
,
took
up
his
knife
and
fork
again
,
and
went
on
eating
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
he
put
his
food
into
his
mouth
abstractedly
,
and
,
with
all
his
faculties
concentrated
on
Joe
,
gazed
at
him
in
a
fit
of
stupefaction
as
he
cut
his
meat
with
one
hand
,
until
he
was
recalled
to
himself
by
symptoms
of
choking
on
his
own
part
,
and
was
by
that
means
restored
to
consciousness
.
 
<EOS>
At
other
times
he
resorted
to
such
small
devices
as
asking
him
for
the
salt
,
the
pepper
,
the
vinegar
,
the
mustard
---
anything
that
was
on
his
maimed
side
---
and
watching
him
as
he
handed
it
.
 
<EOS>
By
dint
of
these
experiments
,
he
did
at
last
so
satisfy
and
convince
himself
,
that
,
after
a
longer
silence
than
he
had
yet
maintained
,
he
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
on
either
side
his
plate
,
drank
a
long
draught
from
a
tankard
beside
him
(
still
keeping
his
eyes
on
Joe
)
,
and
leaning
backward
in
his
chair
and
fetching
a
long
breath
,
said
,
as
he
looked
all
round
the
board
:
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
been
took
off
!
"
  
"
<EOS>
By
George
!
"
said
the
Black
Lion
,
striking
the
table
with
his
hand
,
"
he
's
got
it
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Willet
,
with
the
look
of
a
man
who
felt
that
he
had
earned
a
compliment
,
and
deserved
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
where
it
is
.
<EOS>
It
's
been
took
off
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
him
where
it
was
done
,
"
said
the
Black
Lion
to
Joe
.
  
<EOS>
"
At
the
defence
of
the
Savannah
,
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
the
defence
of
the
Salwanners
,
"
repeated
Mr
Willet
,
softly
;
again
looking
round
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
America
,
where
the
war
is
,
"
said
Joe
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
America
,
where
the
war
is

"
repeated
Mr
Willet
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
took
off
in
the
defence
of
the
Salwanners
in
America
where
the
war
is
.
"
<EOS>
Continuing
to
repeat
these
words
to
himself
in
a
low
tone
of
voice
(
the
same
information
had
been
conveyed
to
him
in
the
same
terms
,
at
least
fifty
times
before
)
,
Mr
Willet
arose
from
table
,
walked
round
to
Joe
,
felt
his
empty
sleeve
all
the
way
up
,
from
the
cuff
,
to
where
the
stump
of
his
arm
remained
;
shook
his
hand
;
lighted
his
pipe
at
the
fire
,
took
a
long
whiff
,
walked
to
the
door
,
turned
round
once
when
he
had
reached
it
,
wiped
his
left
eye
with
the
back
of
his
forefinger
,
and
said
,
in
a
faltering
voice
:
"
<EOS>
My
son
's
arm
---
 
was
took
off
---
at
the
defence
of
the
---
Salwanners
---
in
America
---
where
the
war
is
"
---
with
which
words
he
withdrew
,
and
returned
no
more
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
Indeed
,
on
various
pretences
,
they
all
withdrew
one
after
another
,
save
Dolly
,
who
was
left
sitting
there
alone
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
great
relief
to
be
alone
,
and
she
was
crying
to
her
heart
's
content
,
when
she
heard
Joe
's
voice
at
the
end
of
the
passage
,
bidding
somebody
good
night
.
  
<EOS>
Good
night
!
 
<EOS>
Then
he
was
going
elsewhere
---
to
some
distance
,
perhaps
.
 
<EOS>
To
what
kind
of
home
<EOS>
COULD
he
be
going
,
now
that
it
was
so
late
!
  
<EOS>
She
heard
him
walk
along
the
passage
,
and
pass
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
was
a
hesitation
in
his
footsteps
.
 
<EOS>
He
turned
back
---
Dolly
's
heart
beat
high
---
he
looked
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
night
!
<EOS>
"
---
he
did
n't
say
Dolly
,
but
there
was
comfort
in
his
not
saying
Miss
Varden
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
night
!
<EOS>
"
sobbed
Dolly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
you
take
on
so
much
,
for
what
is
past
and
gone
,
"
said
Joe
kindly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
bear
to
see
you
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
Think
of
it
no
longer
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
safe
and
happy
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dolly
cried
the
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
suffered
very
much
within
these
few
days
---
and
yet
you
're
not
changed
,
unless
it
's
for
the
better
.
 
<EOS>
They
said
you
were
,
but
I
do
n't
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
---
you
were
always
very
beautiful
,
"
said
Joe
,
"
but
you
are
more
beautiful
than
ever
,
now
.
<EOS>
You
are
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
There
can
be
no
harm
in
my
saying
so
,
for
you
must
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
told
so
very
often
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
a
general
principle
,
Dolly
DID
know
it
,
and
WAS
told
so
,
very
often
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
coachmaker
had
turned
out
,
years
ago
,
to
be
a
special
donkey
;
and
whether
she
had
been
afraid
of
making
similar
discoveries
in
others
,
or
had
grown
by
dint
of
long
custom
to
be
careless
of
compliments
generally
,
<EOS>
certain
it
is
that
although
she
cried
so
much
,
she
was
better
pleased
to
be
told
so
now
,
than
ever
she
had
been
in
all
her
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
bless
your
name
,
"
sobbed
the
locksmith
's
little
daughter
,
"
as
long
as
I
live
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
hear
it
spoken
without
feeling
as
if
my
heart
would
burst
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
remember
it
in
my
prayers
,
every
night
and
morning
till
I
die
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
?
"
said
Joe
,
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
indeed
?
 
<EOS>
It
makes
me
---
 
<EOS>
well
,
it
makes
me
very
glad
and
proud
to
hear
you
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dolly
still
sobbed
,
and
held
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
Joe
still
stood
,
looking
at
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
voice
,
"
said
Joe
,
"
brings
up
old
times
so
pleasantly
,
that
,
for
the
moment
,
I
feel
as
if
that
night
---
there
can
be
no
harm
in
talking
of
that
night
now
---
had
come
back
,
and
nothing
had
happened
in
the
mean
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
as
if
I
had
n't
suffered
any
hardships
,
but
had
knocked
down
poor
Tom
Cobb
only
yesterday
,
and
had
come
to
see
you
with
my
bundle
on
my
shoulder
before
running
away
.
<EOS>
---
You
remember
?
"
  
<EOS>
Remember
!
 
<EOS>
But
she
said
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
She
raised
her
eyes
for
an
instant
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
but
<EOS>
a
glance
;
a
little
,
tearful
,
timid
glance
.
 
<EOS>
It
kept
Joe
silent
though
,
for
a
long
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
stoutly
,
"
it
was
to
be
otherwise
,
and
was
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
abroad
,
fighting
all
the
summer
and
frozen
up
all
the
winter
,
ever
since
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
come
back
as
poor
in
purse
as
I
went
,
and
crippled
for
life
besides
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
Dolly
,
I
would
rather
have
lost
this
other
arm
<EOS>
---
ay
,
I
would
rather
have
lost
my
head
---
than
have
come
back
to
find
you
dead
,
or
anything
<EOS>
but
what
I
always
pictured
you
to
myself
,
and
what
I
always
hoped
and
wished
to
find
you
.
<EOS>
Thank
God
for
all
!
"
  
<EOS>
Oh
how
much
,
and
how
keenly
,
the
little
coquette
of
five
years
ago
,
felt
now
!
 
<EOS>
She
had
found
her
heart
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
Never
having
known
its
worth
till
now
,
she
had
never
known
the
worth
of
his
.
 
<EOS>
How
priceless
it
appeared
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
hope
once
,
"
said
Joe
,
in
his
homely
way
,
"
that
I
might
come
back
a
rich
man
,
and
marry
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
was
a
boy
then
,
and
have
long
known
better
than
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
a
poor
,
maimed
,
discharged
soldier
,
and
must
be
content
to
rub
through
life
as
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
say
,
even
now
,
that
I
shall
be
glad
to
see
you
married
,
Dolly
;
but
I
AM
glad
---
yes
,
I
am
,
and
glad
to
think
I
can
say
so
---
to
know
that
you
are
admired
and
courted
,
and
can
pick
and
choose
for
a
happy
life
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
comfort
to
me
to
know
that
you
'll
talk
to
your
husband
about
me
;
and
I
hope
the
time
will
come
when
I
may
be
able
to
like
him
,
and
to
shake
hands
with
him
,
and
to
come
and
see
you
as
a
poor
friend
who
knew
you
when
you
were
a
girl
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
His
hand
DID
tremble
;
but
for
all
that
,
he
took
it
away
again
,
and
left
her
.

Chapter
73
    
<EOS>
By
this
Friday
night
---
for
it
was
on
Friday
in
the
riot
week
,
that
Emma
and
Dolly
were
rescued
,
by
the
timely
aid
of
Joe
and
Edward
Chester
---
the
disturbances
were
entirely
quelled
,
and
peace
and
order
were
restored
to
the
affrighted
city
.
 
<EOS>
True
,
after
what
had
happened
,
it
was
impossible
for
any
man
to
say
how
long
this
better
state
of
things
might
last
,
or
how
suddenly
new
outrages
,
exceeding
even
those
so
lately
witnessed
,
might
burst
forth
and
fill
its
streets
with
ruin
and
bloodshed
;
for
this
reason
,
those
who
had
fled
from
the
recent
tumults
still
kept
at
a
distance
,
and
many
families
,
hitherto
unable
to
procure
the
means
of
flight
,
now
availed
themselves
of
the
calm
,
and
withdrew
into
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
The
shops
,
too
,
from
Tyburn
to
Whitechapel
,
were
still
shut
;
and
very
little
business
was
transacted
in
any
of
the
places
of
great
commercial
resort
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
notwithstanding
,
and
in
spite
of
the
melancholy
forebodings
of
that
numerous
class
of
society
who
see
with
the
greatest
clearness
into
the
darkest
perspectives
,
the
town
remained
profoundly
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
The
strong
military
force
disposed
in
every
advantageous
quarter
,
and
stationed
at
every
commanding
point
,
held
the
scattered
fragments
of
the
mob
in
check
;
the
search
after
rioters
was
prosecuted
with
unrelenting
vigour
;
and
if
there
were
any
among
them
so
desperate
and
reckless
as
to
be
inclined
,
after
the
terrible
scenes
they
had
beheld
,
to
venture
forth
again
,
they
were
so
daunted
by
these
resolute
measures
,
that
they
quickly
shrunk
into
their
hiding
-
places
,
and
had
no
thought
but
for
their
safety
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
the
crowd
was
utterly
routed
.
 
<EOS>
Upwards
of
two
hundred
had
been
shot
dead
in
the
streets
.
 
<EOS>
Two
hundred
and
fifty
more
were
lying
,
badly
wounded
,
in
the
hospitals
;
of
whom
seventy
or
eighty
died
within
a
short
time
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
A
hundred
were
already
in
custody
,
and
more
were
taken
every
hour
.
 
<EOS>
How
many
perished
in
the
conflagrations
,
or
by
their
own
excesses
,
is
unknown
;
but
that
numbers
found
a
terrible
grave
in
the
hot
ashes
of
the
flames
they
had
kindled
,
or
crept
into
vaults
and
cellars
to
drink
in
secret
or
to
nurse
their
sores
,
and
never
saw
the
light
again
,
is
certain
.
<EOS>
When
the
embers
of
the
fires
had
been
black
and
cold
for
many
weeks
,
the
labourers
'
spades
proved
this
,
beyond
a
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
Seventy
-
two
private
houses
and
four
strong
jails
were
destroyed
in
the
four
great
days
of
these
riots
.
 
<EOS>
The
total
loss
of
property
,
as
estimated
by
the
sufferers
,
was
one
hundred
and
fifty
-
five
thousand
pounds
;
at
the
lowest
and
least
partial
estimate
of
disinterested
persons
,
it
exceeded
one
hundred
and
twenty
-
five
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
For
this
immense
loss
,
compensation
was
soon
afterwards
made
out
of
the
public
purse
,
in
pursuance
of
a
vote
of
the
House
of
Commons
;
the
sum
being
levied
on
the
various
wards
in
the
city
,
on
the
county
,
and
the
borough
of
Southwark
.
 
<EOS>
Both
Lord
Mansfield
and
Lord
Saville
,
however
,
who
had
been
great
sufferers
,
refused
to
accept
of
any
compensation
whatever
.
  
<EOS>
The
House
of
Commons
,
sitting
on
Tuesday
with
locked
and
guarded
doors
,
had
passed
a
resolution
to
the
effect
that
,
as
soon
as
the
tumults
subsided
,
it
would
immediately
proceed
to
consider
the
petitions
presented
from
many
of
his
Majesty
's
Protestant
subjects
,
and
would
take
the
same
into
its
serious
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
While
this
question
was
under
debate
,
Mr
Herbert
,
one
of
the
members
present
,
indignantly
rose
and
called
upon
the
House
to
observe
that
Lord
George
Gordon
was
then
sitting
under
the
gallery
with
the
blue
cockade
,
the
signal
of
rebellion
,
in
his
hat
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
only
obliged
,
by
those
who
sat
near
,
to
take
it
out
;
but
offering
to
go
into
the
street
to
pacify
the
mob
with
the
somewhat
indefinite
assurance
that
the
House
was
prepared
to
give
them
"
the
satisfaction
they
sought
,
"
was
actually
held
down
in
his
seat
by
the
combined
force
of
several
members
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
the
disorder
and
violence
which
reigned
triumphant
out
of
doors
,
penetrated
into
the
senate
,
and
there
,
as
elsewhere
,
terror
and
alarm
prevailed
,
and
ordinary
forms
were
for
the
time
forgotten
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
Thursday
,
both
Houses
had
adjourned
until
the
following
Monday
se'nnight
,
declaring
it
impossible
to
pursue
their
deliberations
with
the
necessary
gravity
and
freedom
,
while
they
were
surrounded
by
armed
troops
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
that
the
rioters
were
dispersed
,
the
citizens
were
beset
with
a
new
fear
;
for
,
finding
the
public
thoroughfares
and
all
their
usual
places
of
resort
filled
with
soldiers
entrusted
with
the
free
use
of
fire
and
sword
,
they
began
to
lend
a
greedy
ear
to
the
rumours
which
were
afloat
of
martial
law
being
declared
,
and
to
dismal
stories
of
prisoners
having
been
seen
hanging
on
lamp
-
posts
in
Cheapside
and
Fleet
Street
.
 
<EOS>
These
terrors
being
promptly
dispelled
by
a
Proclamation
declaring
that
all
the
rioters
in
custody
would
be
tried
by
a
special
commission
in
due
course
of
law
,
a
fresh
alarm
was
engendered
by
its
being
whispered
abroad
that
French
money
had
been
found
on
some
of
the
rioters
,
and
that
the
disturbances
had
been
fomented
by
foreign
powers
who
sought
to
compass
the
overthrow
and
ruin
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
This
report
,
which
was
strengthened
by
the
diffusion
of
anonymous
handbills
,
but
which
,
if
it
had
any
foundation
at
all
,
probably
owed
its
origin
to
the
circumstance
of
some
few
coins
which
were
not
English
money
having
been
swept
into
the
pockets
of
the
insurgents
with
other
miscellaneous
booty
,
and
afterwards
discovered
on
the
prisoners
or
the
dead
bodies
,
---
caused
a
great
sensation
;
and
men
's
minds
being
in
that
excited
state
when
they
are
most
apt
to
catch
at
any
shadow
of
apprehension
,
was
bruited
about
with
much
industry
.
  
<EOS>
All
remaining
quiet
,
however
,
during
the
whole
of
this
Friday
,
and
on
this
Friday
night
,
and
no
new
discoveries
being
made
,
confidence
began
to
be
restored
,
and
the
most
timid
and
desponding
breathed
again
.
 
<EOS>
In
Southwark
,
no
fewer
than
three
thousand
of
the
inhabitants
formed
themselves
into
a
watch
,
and
patrolled
the
streets
every
hour
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
were
the
citizens
slow
to
follow
so
good
an
example
:
and
it
being
the
manner
of
peaceful
men
to
be
very
bold
when
the
danger
is
over
,
they
were
abundantly
fierce
and
daring
;
not
scrupling
to
question
the
stoutest
passenger
with
great
severity
,
and
carrying
it
with
a
very
high
hand
over
all
errand
-
boys
,
servant
-
girls
,
and
'
prentices
.
  
<EOS>
As
day
deepened
into
evening
,
and
darkness
crept
into
the
nooks
and
corners
of
the
town
as
if
it
were
mustering
in
secret
and
gathering
strength
to
venture
into
the
open
ways
,
Barnaby
sat
in
his
dungeon
,
wondering
at
the
silence
,
and
listening
in
vain
for
the
noise
and
outcry
which
had
ushered
in
the
night
of
late
.
 
<EOS>
Beside
him
,
with
his
hand
in
hers
,
sat
one
in
whose
companionship
he
felt
at
peace
.
<EOS>
She
was
worn
,
and
altered
,
full
of
grief
,
and
heavy
-
hearted
;
but
the
same
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
"
he
said
,
after
a
long
silence
:
"
how
long
,
---
how
many
days
and
nights
,
---
shall
I
be
kept
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
many
,
dear
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
not
many
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
hope
!
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
but
your
hoping
will
not
undo
these
chains
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
,
but
they
do
n't
mind
that
.
 
<EOS>
Grip
hopes
,
but
who
cares
for
Grip
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
raven
gave
a
short
,
dull
,
melancholy
croak
.
 
<EOS>
It
said
"
<EOS>
Nobody
,
"
as
plainly
as
a
croak
could
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
cares
for
Grip
,
except
you
and
me
?
"
said
Barnaby
,
smoothing
the
bird
's
rumpled
feathers
with
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
never
speaks
in
this
place
;
he
never
says
a
word
in
jail
;
he
sits
and
mopes
all
day
in
his
dark
corner
,
dozing
sometimes
,
and
sometimes
looking
at
the
light
that
creeps
in
through
the
bars
,
and
shines
in
his
bright
eye
as
if
a
spark
from
those
great
fires
had
fallen
into
the
room
and
was
burning
yet
.
 
<EOS>
But
who
cares
for
Grip
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
raven
croaked
again
---
Nobody
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
by
the
way
,
"
said
Barnaby
,
withdrawing
his
hand
from
the
bird
,
and
laying
it
upon
his
mother
's
arm
,
as
he
looked
eagerly
in
her
face
;
"
if
they
kill
me
---
they
may
:
I
heard
it
said
they
would
---
what
will
become
of
Grip
when
I
am
dead
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
sound
of
the
word
,
or
the
current
of
his
own
thoughts
,
suggested
to
Grip
his
old
phrase
"
Never
say
die
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
he
stopped
short
in
the
middle
of
it
,
drew
a
dismal
cork
,
and
subsided
into
a
faint
croak
,
as
if
he
lacked
the
heart
to
get
through
the
shortest
sentence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
they
take
HIS
life
as
well
as
mine
?
"
said
Barnaby
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
they
would
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
and
I
and
he
could
die
together
,
there
would
be
none
to
feel
sorry
,
or
to
grieve
for
us
.
 
<EOS>
But
do
what
they
will
,
I
do
n't
fear
them
,
mother
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
will
not
harm
you
,
"
she
said
,
her
tears
choking
her
utterance
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
never
will
harm
you
,
when
they
know
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
they
never
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
too
sure
of
that
,
"
cried
Barnaby
,
with
a
strange
pleasure
in
the
belief
that
she
was
self
-
deceived
,
and
in
his
own
sagacity
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
have
marked
me
from
the
first
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
them
say
so
to
each
other
when
they
brought
me
to
this
place
last
night
;
and
I
believe
them
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
cry
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
They
said
that
I
was
bold
,
and
so
I
am
,
and
<EOS>
so
I
will
be
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
think
that
I
am
silly
,
but
I
can
die
as
well
as
another
.
<EOS>
---
I
have
done
no
harm
,
have
I
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
quickly
.
  
<EOS>
"
None
before
Heaven
,
"
she
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
then
,
"
said
Barnaby
,
"
let
them
do
their
worst
.
 
<EOS>
You
told
me
once
---
you
---
when
I
asked
you
what
death
meant
,
that
it
was
nothing
to
be
feared
,
if
we
did
no
harm
---
<EOS>
Aha
!
<EOS>
mother
,
you
thought
I
had
forgotten
that
!
"
  
<EOS>
His
merry
laugh
and
playful
manner
smote
her
to
the
heart
.
 
<EOS>
She
drew
him
closer
to
her
,
and
besought
him
to
talk
to
her
in
whispers
and
to
be
very
quiet
,
for
it
was
getting
dark
,
and
their
time
was
short
,
and
she
would
soon
have
to
leave
him
for
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
come
to
-
morrow
?
"
said
Barnaby
.
  
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
And
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
And
they
would
never
part
again
.
  
<EOS>
He
joyfully
replied
that
this
was
well
,
and
what
he
wished
,
and
what
he
had
felt
quite
certain
she
would
tell
him
;
and
then
he
asked
her
where
she
had
been
so
long
,
and
why
she
had
not
come
to
see
him
when
he
had
been
a
great
soldier
,
and
ran
through
the
wild
schemes
he
had
had
for
their
being
rich
and
living
prosperously
,
and
with
some
faint
notion
in
his
mind
that
she
was
sad
and
he
had
made
her
so
,
tried
to
console
and
comfort
her
,
and
talked
of
their
former
life
and
his
old
sports
and
freedom
:
<EOS>
little
dreaming
that
every
word
he
uttered
only
increased
her
sorrow
,
and
that
her
tears
fell
faster
at
the
freshened
recollection
of
their
lost
tranquillity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
"
said
Barnaby
,
as
they
heard
the
man
approaching
to
close
the
cells
for
the
night
,
"
when
I
spoke
to
you
just
now
about
my
father
you
cried
"
Hush
!
"
and
turned
away
your
head
.
 
<EOS>
Why
did
you
do
so
?
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
why
,
in
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
You
thought
HE
was
dead
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
not
sorry
that
he
is
alive
and
has
come
back
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
Where
is
he
?
<EOS>
Here
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
not
ask
any
one
where
he
is
,
or
speak
about
him
,
"
she
made
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
said
Barnaby
.
 
<EOS>
"
Because
he
is
a
stern
man
,
and
talks
roughly
?
 
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
him
,
or
want
to
be
with
him
by
myself
;
but
why
not
speak
about
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
am
sorry
that
he
is
alive
;
sorry
that
he
has
come
back
;
and
sorry
that
he
and
you
have
ever
met
.
 
<EOS>
Because
,
dear
Barnaby
,
the
endeavour
of
my
life
has
been
to
keep
you
two
asunder
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Father
and
son
asunder
!
 
<EOS>
Why
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
has
,
"
she
whispered
in
his
ear
,
"
he
has
shed
blood
.
 
<EOS>
The
time
has
come
when
you
must
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
shed
the
blood
of
one
who
loved
him
well
,
and
trusted
him
,
and
never
did
him
wrong
in
word
or
deed
.
"
  
<EOS>
Barnaby
recoiled
in
horror
,
and
glancing
at
his
stained
wrist
for
an
instant
,
wrapped
it
,
shuddering
,
in
his
dress
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
"
she
added
hastily
as
the
key
turned
in
the
lock
,
"
although
we
shun
him
,
he
is
your
father
,
dearest
,
and
I
am
his
wretched
wife
.
 
<EOS>
They
seek
his
life
,
and
he
will
lose
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
by
our
means
;
nay
,
if
we
could
win
him
back
to
penitence
,
we
should
be
bound
to
love
him
yet
.
 
<EOS>
Do
not
seem
to
know
him
,
except
as
one
who
fled
with
you
from
the
jail
,
and
if
they
question
you
about
him
,
do
not
answer
them
.
 
<EOS>
God
be
with
you
through
the
night
,
dear
boy
!
 
<EOS>
God
be
with
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
tore
herself
away
,
and
in
a
few
seconds
Barnaby
was
alone
.
 
<EOS>
He
stood
for
a
long
time
rooted
to
the
spot
,
with
his
face
hidden
in
his
hands
;
then
flung
himself
,
sobbing
,
on
his
miserable
bed
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
moon
came
slowly
up
in
all
her
gentle
glory
,
and
the
stars
looked
out
,
and
through
the
small
compass
of
the
grated
window
,
as
through
the
narrow
crevice
of
one
good
deed
in
a
murky
life
of
guilt
,
the
face
of
Heaven
shone
bright
and
merciful
.
 
<EOS>
He
raised
his
head
;
gazed
upward
at
the
quiet
sky
,
which
seemed
to
smile
upon
the
earth
in
sadness
,
as
if
the
night
,
more
thoughtful
than
the
day
,
looked
down
in
sorrow
on
the
sufferings
and
evil
deeds
of
men
;
and
felt
its
peace
sink
deep
into
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
He
,
a
poor
idiot
,
caged
in
his
narrow
cell
,
was
as
much
lifted
up
to
God
,
while
gazing
on
the
mild
light
,
as
the
freest
and
most
favoured
man
in
all
the
spacious
city
;
and
in
his
ill
-
remembered
prayer
,
and
in
the
fragment
of
the
childish
hymn
,
with
which
he
sung
and
crooned
himself
asleep
,
there
breathed
as
true
a
spirit
as
ever
studied
homily
expressed
,
or
old
cathedral
arches
echoed
.
  
<EOS>
As
his
mother
crossed
a
yard
on
her
way
out
,
she
saw
,
through
a
grated
door
which
separated
it
from
another
court
,
her
husband
,
walking
round
and
round
,
with
his
hands
folded
on
his
breast
,
and
his
head
hung
down
.
 
<EOS>
She
asked
the
man
who
conducted
her
,
if
she
might
speak
a
word
with
this
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
but
she
must
be
quick
for
he
was
locking
up
for
the
night
,
and
there
was
but
a
minute
or
so
to
spare
.
 
<EOS>
Saying
this
,
he
unlocked
the
door
,
and
bade
her
go
in
.
  
<EOS>
It
grated
harshly
as
it
turned
upon
its
hinges
,
but
he
was
deaf
to
the
noise
,
and
still
walked
round
and
round
the
little
court
,
without
raising
his
head
or
changing
his
attitude
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
She
spoke
to
him
,
but
her
voice
was
weak
,
and
failed
her
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
she
put
herself
in
his
track
,
and
when
he
came
near
,
stretched
out
her
hand
and
touched
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
started
backward
,
trembling
from
head
to
foot
;
but
seeing
who
it
was
,
demanded
why
she
came
there
.
 
<EOS>
Before
she
could
reply
,
he
spoke
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Am
I
to
live
or
die
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
murder
too
,
or
spare
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
son
---
our
son
,
"
she
answered
,
"
is
in
this
prison
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
that
to
me
?
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
stamping
impatiently
on
the
stone
pavement
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
can
no
more
aid
me
than
I
can
aid
him
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
come
to
talk
of
him
,
begone
!
"
  
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
he
resumed
his
walk
,
and
hurried
round
the
court
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
came
again
to
where
she
stood
,
he
stopped
,
and
said
,
  
"
<EOS>
Am
I
to
live
or
die
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
repent
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
---
do
YOU
?
"
<EOS>
she
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
,
while
time
remains
?
 
<EOS>
Do
not
believe
that
I
could
save
you
,
if
I
dared
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Say
if
you
would
,
"
he
answered
with
an
oath
,
as
he
tried
to
disengage
himself
and
pass
on
.
 
<EOS>
"
Say
if
you
would
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Listen
to
me
for
one
moment
,
"
she
returned
;
"
for
but
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
but
newly
risen
from
a
sick
-
bed
,
from
which
I
never
hoped
to
rise
again
.
 
<EOS>
The
best
among
us
think
,
at
such
a
time
,
of
good
intentions
half
-
performed
and
duties
left
undone
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
have
ever
,
since
that
fatal
night
,
omitted
to
pray
for
your
repentance
before
death
---
if
I
omitted
,
even
then
,
anything
which
might
tend
to
urge
it
on
you
when
the
horror
of
your
crime
was
fresh
---
if
,
in
our
later
meeting
,
I
yielded
to
the
dread
that
was
upon
me
,
and
forgot
to
fall
upon
my
knees
and
solemnly
adjure
you
,
in
the
name
of
him
you
sent
to
his
account
with
Heaven
,
to
prepare
for
the
retribution
which
must
come
,
and
which
is
stealing
on
you
now
---
I
humbly
before
you
,
and
in
the
agony
of
supplication
in
which
you
see
me
,
beseech
that
you
will
let
me
make
atonement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
meaning
of
your
canting
words
?
"
<EOS>
he
answered
roughly
.
"
<EOS>
Speak
so
that
I
may
understand
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
"
she
answered
,
"
I
desire
to
.
 
<EOS>
Bear
with
me
for
a
moment
more
.
 
<EOS>
The
hand
of
Him
who
set
His
curse
on
murder
,
is
heavy
on
us
now
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
not
doubt
it
.
 
<EOS>
Our
son
,
our
innocent
boy
,
on
whom
His
anger
fell
before
his
birth
,
is
in
this
place
in
peril
of
his
life
---
 
<EOS>
brought
here
by
your
guilt
;
yes
,
by
that
alone
,
as
Heaven
sees
and
knows
,
for
he
has
been
led
astray
in
the
darkness
of
his
intellect
,
and
that
is
the
terrible
consequence
of
your
crime
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
come
,
woman
-
like
,
to
load
me
with
reproaches
---
"
he
muttered
,
again
endeavouring
to
break
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
different
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
hear
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
not
to
-
night
,
to
-
morrow
;
if
not
to
-
morrow
,
at
another
time
.
 
<EOS>
You
MUST
hear
it

<EOS>
Husband
,
escape
is
hopeless
---
impossible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
tell
me
so
,
do
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
raising
his
manacled
hand
,
and
shaking
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
she
said
,
with
indescribable
earnestness
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
why
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
make
me
easy
in
this
jail
.
 
<EOS>
To
make
the
time
'
twixt
this
and
death
,
pass
pleasantly
.
 
<EOS>
For
my
good
---
yes
,
for
my
good
,
of
course
,
"
he
said
,
grinding
his
teeth
,
and
smiling
at
her
with
a
livid
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
to
load
you
with
reproaches
,
"
she
replied
;
"
not
to
aggravate
the
tortures
and
miseries
of
your
condition
,
not
to
give
you
one
hard
word
,
but
to
restore
you
to
peace
and
hope
.
 
<EOS>
Husband
,
dear
husband
,
if
you
will
but
confess
this
dreadful
crime
;
if
you
will
but
implore
forgiveness
of
Heaven
and
of
those
whom
you
have
wronged
on
earth
;
if
you
will
dismiss
these
vain
uneasy
thoughts
,
which
never
can
be
realised
,
and
will
rely
on
Penitence
and
on
the
Truth
,
I
promise
you
,
in
the
great
name
of
the
Creator
,
whose
image
you
have
defaced
,
that
He
will
comfort
and
console
you
.
 
<EOS>
And
for
myself
,
"
she
cried
,
clasping
her
hands
,
and
looking
upward
,
"
I
swear
before
Him
,
as
He
knows
my
heart
and
reads
it
now
,
that
from
that
hour
I
will
love
and
cherish
you
as
I
did
of
old
,
and
watch
you
night
and
day
in
the
short
interval
that
will
remain
to
us
,
and
soothe
you
with
my
truest
love
and
duty
,
and
pray
with
you
,
that
one
threatening
judgment
may
be
arrested
,
and
that
our
boy
may
be
spared
to
bless
God
,
in
his
poor
way
,
in
the
free
air
and
light
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
fell
back
and
gazed
at
her
while
she
poured
out
these
words
,
as
though
he
were
for
a
moment
awed
by
her
manner
,
and
knew
not
what
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
But
anger
and
fear
soon
got
the
mastery
of
him
,
and
he
spurned
her
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Begone
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
Leave
me
!
 
<EOS>
You
plot
,
do
you
!
 
<EOS>
You
plot
to
get
speech
with
me
,
and
let
them
know
I
am
the
man
they
say
I
am
.
<EOS>
A
curse
on
you
and
on
your
boy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
him
the
curse
has
already
fallen
,
"
she
replied
,
wringing
her
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
it
fall
heavier
.
 
<EOS>
Let
it
fall
on
one
and
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
hate
you
both
.
 
<EOS>
The
worst
has
come
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
comfort
that
I
seek
or
I
can
have
,
will
be
the
knowledge
that
it
comes
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Now
go
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
would
have
urged
him
gently
,
even
then
,
but
he
menaced
her
with
his
chain
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
go
---
I
say
it
for
the
last
time
.
 
<EOS>
The
gallows
has
me
in
its
grasp
,
and
it
is
a
black
phantom
that
may
urge
me
on
to
something
more
.
 
<EOS>
Begone
!
 
<EOS>
I
curse
the
hour
that
I
was
born
,
the
man
I
slew
,
and
all
the
living
world
!
"
  
<EOS>
In
a
paroxysm
of
wrath
,
and
terror
,
and
the
fear
of
death
,
he
broke
from
her
,
and
rushed
into
the
darkness
of
his
cell
,
where
he
cast
himself
jangling
down
upon
the
stone
floor
,
and
smote
it
with
his
ironed
hands
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
returned
to
lock
the
dungeon
door
,
and
having
done
so
,
carried
her
away
.
  
<EOS>
On
that
warm
,
balmy
night
in
June
,
there
were
glad
faces
and
light
hearts
in
all
quarters
of
the
town
,
and
sleep
,
banished
by
the
late
horrors
,
was
doubly
welcomed
.
 
<EOS>
On
that
night
,
families
made
merry
in
their
houses
,
and
greeted
each
other
on
the
common
danger
they
had
escaped
;
and
those
who
had
been
denounced
,
ventured
into
the
streets
;
and
they
who
had
been
plundered
,
got
good
shelter
.
 
<EOS>
Even
the
timorous
Lord
Mayor
,
who
was
summoned
that
night
before
the
Privy
Council
to
answer
for
his
conduct
,
came
back
contented
;
observing
to
all
his
friends
that
he
had
got
off
very
well
with
a
reprimand
,
and
repeating
with
huge
satisfaction
his
memorable
defence
before
the
Council
,
"
that
such
was
his
temerity
<EOS>
,
he
thought
death
would
have
been
his
portion
.
"
  
<EOS>
On
that
night
,
too
,
more
of
the
scattered
remnants
of
the
mob
were
traced
to
their
lurking
-
places
,
and
taken
;
and
in
the
hospitals
,
and
deep
among
the
ruins
they
had
made
,
and
in
the
ditches
,
and
fields
,
many
unshrouded
wretches
lay
dead
:
envied
by
those
who
had
been
active
in
the
disturbances
,
and
who
pillowed
their
doomed
heads
in
the
temporary
jails
.
  
<EOS>
And
in
the
Tower
,
in
a
dreary
room
whose
thick
stone
walls
shut
out
the
hum
of
life
,
and
made
a
stillness
which
the
records
left
by
former
prisoners
with
those
silent
witnesses
seemed
to
deepen
and
intensify
;
remorseful
for
every
act
that
had
been
done
by
every
man
among
the
cruel
crowd
;
feeling
for
the
time
their
guilt
his
own
,
and
their
lives
put
in
peril
by
himself
;
and
finding
,
amidst
such
reflections
,
little
comfort
in
fanaticism
,
or
in
his
fancied
call
;
sat
the
unhappy
author
of
all
---
Lord
George
Gordon
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
been
made
prisoner
that
evening
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
sure
it
's
me
<EOS>
you
want
,
"
he
said
to
the
officers
,
who
waited
outside
with
the
warrant
for
his
arrest
on
a
charge
of
High
Treason
,
"
I
am
ready
to
accompany
you
---
"
which
he
did
without
resistance
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
conducted
first
before
the
Privy
Council
,
and
afterwards
to
the
Horse
Guards
,
and
then
was
taken
by
way
of
Westminster
Bridge
,
and
back
over
London
Bridge
(
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
the
main
streets
)
,
to
the
Tower
,
under
the
strongest
guard
ever
known
to
enter
its
gates
with
a
single
prisoner
.
  
<EOS>
Of
all
his
forty
thousand
men
,
not
one
remained
to
bear
him
company
.
 
<EOS>
Friends
,
dependents
,
followers
,
---
none
were
there
.
 
<EOS>
His
fawning
secretary
had
played
the
traitor
;
and
he
whose
weakness
had
been
goaded
and
urged
on
by
so
many
for
their
own
purposes
,
was
desolate
and
alone
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
74
    
Me
Dennis
,
having
been
made
prisoner
late
in
the
evening
,
was
removed
to
a
neighbouring
round
-
house
for
that
night
,
and
carried
before
a
justice
for
examination
on
the
next
day
,
Saturday
.
 
<EOS>
The
charges
against
him
being
numerous
and
weighty
,
and
it
being
in
particular
proved
,
by
the
testimony
of
Gabriel
Varden
,
that
he
had
shown
a
special
desire
to
take
his
life
,
he
was
committed
for
trial
.
 
<EOS>
Moreover
he
was
honoured
with
the
distinction
of
being
considered
a
chief
among
the
insurgents
,
and
received
from
the
magistrate
's
lips
the
complimentary
assurance
that
he
was
in
a
position
of
imminent
danger
,
and
would
do
well
to
prepare
himself
for
the
worst
.
  
<EOS>
To
say
that
Mr
Dennis
's
modesty
was
not
somewhat
startled
by
these
honours
,
or
that
he
was
altogether
prepared
for
so
flattering
a
reception
,
would
be
to
claim
for
him
a
greater
amount
of
stoical
philosophy
than
even
he
possessed
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
this
gentleman
's
stoicism
was
of
that
not
uncommon
kind
,
which
enables
a
man
to
bear
with
exemplary
fortitude
the
afflictions
of
his
friends
,
but
renders
him
,
by
way
of
counterpoise
,
rather
selfish
and
sensitive
in
respect
of
any
that
happen
to
befall
himself
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
therefore
no
disparagement
to
the
great
officer
in
question
to
state
,
without
disguise
or
concealment
,
that
he
was
at
first
very
much
alarmed
,
and
that
he
betrayed
divers
emotions
of
fear
,
until
his
reasoning
powers
came
to
his
relief
,
and
set
before
him
a
more
hopeful
prospect
.
  
<EOS>
In
proportion
as
Mr
Dennis
exercised
these
intellectual
qualities
with
which
he
was
gifted
,
in
reviewing
his
best
chances
of
coming
off
handsomely
and
with
small
personal
inconvenience
,
his
spirits
rose
,
and
his
confidence
increased
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
remembered
the
great
estimation
in
which
his
office
was
held
,
and
the
constant
demand
for
his
services
;
when
he
bethought
himself
,
how
the
Statute
Book
regarded
him
as
a
kind
of
Universal
Medicine
applicable
to
men
,
women
,
and
children
,
of
every
age
and
variety
of
criminal
constitution
;
and
how
high
he
stood
,
in
his
official
capacity
,
in
the
favour
of
the
Crown
,
and
both
Houses
of
Parliament
,
the
Mint
,
the
Bank
of
England
,
and
the
Judges
of
the
land
;
when
he
recollected
that
whatever
Ministry
was
in
or
out
,
he
remained
their
peculiar
pet
and
panacea
,
and
that
for
his
sake
England
stood
single
and
conspicuous
among
the
civilised
nations
of
the
earth
:
when
he
called
these
things
to
mind
and
dwelt
upon
them
,
he
felt
certain
that
the
national
gratitude
MUST
relieve
him
from
the
consequences
of
his
late
proceedings
,
and
would
certainly
restore
him
to
his
old
place
in
the
happy
social
system
.
  
<EOS>
With
these
crumbs
,
or
as
one
may
say
,
with
these
whole
loaves
of
comfort
to
regale
upon
,
Mr
Dennis
took
his
place
among
the
escort
that
awaited
him
,
and
repaired
to
jail
with
a
manly
indifference
.
<EOS>
Arriving
at
Newgate
,
where
some
of
the
ruined
cells
had
been
hastily
fitted
up
for
the
safe
keeping
of
rioters
,
he
was
warmly
received
by
the
turnkeys
,
as
an
unusual
and
interesting
case
,
which
agreeably
relieved
their
monotonous
duties
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
spirit
,
he
was
fettered
with
great
care
,
and
conveyed
into
the
interior
of
the
prison
.
  
<EOS>
"
Brother
,
"
cried
the
hangman
,
as
,
following
an
officer
,
he
traversed
under
these
novel
circumstances
the
remains
of
passages
with
which
he
was
well
acquainted
,
"
am
I
going
to
be
along
with
anybody
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
'd
have
left
more
walls
standing
,
you
'd
have
been
alone
,
"
was
the
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
it
is
,
we
're
cramped
for
room
,
and
you
'll
have
company
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
returned
Dennis
,
"
I
do
n't
object
to
company
,
brother
.
 
<EOS>
I
rather
like
company
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
formed
for
society
,
I
was
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
rather
a
pity
,
an't
it
?
"
said
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
answered
Dennis
,
"
I
'm
not
aware
that
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
Why
should
it
be
a
pity
,
brother
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
the
man
carelessly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
that
was
what
you
meant
.
 
<EOS>
Being
formed
for
society
,
and
being
cut
off
in
your
flower
,
you
know
---
"
  
"
I
say
,
"
interposed
the
other
quickly
,
"
what
are
you
talking
of
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
.
 
<EOS>
Who
's
a
-
going
to
be
cut
off
in
their
flowers
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
nobody
particular
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
you
was
,
perhaps
,
"
said
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dennis
wiped
his
face
,
which
had
suddenly
grown
very
hot
,
and
remarking
in
a
tremulous
voice
to
his
conductor
that
he
had
always
been
fond
of
his
joke
,
followed
him
in
silence
until
he
stopped
at
a
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
my
quarters
,
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
facetiously
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
shop
,
sir
,
"
replied
his
friend
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
walking
in
,
but
not
with
the
best
possible
grace
,
when
he
suddenly
stopped
,
and
started
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
Halloa
!
"
said
the
officer
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
nervous
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nervous
!
"
whispered
Dennis
in
great
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
I
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
Shut
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
when
you
're
in
,
"
returned
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
ca
n't
go
in
there
,
"
whispered
Dennis
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
be
shut
up
with
that
man
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
want
me
to
be
throttled
,
brother
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
officer
seemed
to
entertain
no
particular
desire
on
the
subject
one
way
or
other
,
but
briefly
remarking
that
he
had
his
orders
,
and
intended
to
obey
them
,
pushed
him
in
,
turned
the
key
,
and
retired
.
  
<EOS>
Dennis
stood
trembling
with
his
back
against
the
door
,
and
involuntarily
raising
his
arm
to
defend
himself
,
stared
at
a
man
,
the
only
other
tenant
of
the
cell
,
who
lay
,
stretched
at
his
fall
length
,
upon
a
stone
bench
,
and
who
paused
in
his
deep
breathing
as
if
he
were
about
to
wake
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
rolled
over
on
one
side
,
let
his
arm
fall
negligently
down
,
drew
a
long
sigh
,
and
murmuring
indistinctly
,
fell
fast
asleep
again
.
  
<EOS>
Relieved
in
some
degree
by
this
,
the
hangman
took
his
eyes
for
an
instant
from
the
slumbering
figure
,
and
glanced
round
the
cell
in
search
of
some
"
vantage
-
ground
or
weapon
of
defence
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
moveable
within
it
,
but
a
clumsy
table
which
could
not
be
displaced
without
noise
,
and
a
heavy
chair
.
 
<EOS>
Stealing
on
tiptoe
towards
this
latter
piece
of
furniture
,
he
retired
with
it
into
the
remotest
corner
,
and
intrenching
himself
behind
it
,
watched
the
enemy
with
the
utmost
vigilance
and
caution
.
  
<EOS>
The
sleeping
man
was
Hugh
;
and
perhaps
it
was
not
unnatural
for
Dennis
to
feel
in
a
state
of
very
uncomfortable
suspense
,
and
to
wish
with
his
whole
soul
that
he
might
never
wake
again
.
 
<EOS>
Tired
of
standing
,
he
crouched
down
in
his
corner
after
some
time
,
and
rested
on
the
cold
pavement
;
but
although
Hugh
's
breathing
still
proclaimed
that
he
was
sleeping
soundly
,
he
could
not
trust
him
out
of
his
sight
for
an
instant
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
so
afraid
of
him
,
and
of
some
sudden
onslaught
,
that
he
was
not
content
to
see
his
closed
eyes
through
the
chair
-
back
,
but
every
now
and
then
,
rose
stealthily
to
his
feet
,
and
peered
at
him
with
outstretched
neck
,
to
assure
himself
that
he
really
was
still
asleep
,
and
was
not
about
to
spring
upon
him
when
he
was
off
his
guard
.
  
<EOS>
He
slept
so
long
and
<EOS>
so
soundly
,
that
Mr
Dennis
began
to
think
he
might
sleep
on
until
the
turnkey
visited
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
congratulating
himself
upon
these
promising
appearances
,
and
blessing
his
stars
with
much
fervour
,
when
one
or
two
unpleasant
symptoms
manifested
themselves
:
such
as
another
motion
of
the
arm
,
another
sigh
,
a
restless
tossing
of
the
head
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
just
as
it
seemed
that
he
was
about
to
fall
heavily
to
the
ground
from
his
narrow
bed
,
Hugh
's
eyes
opened
.
  
<EOS>
It
happened
that
his
face
was
turned
directly
towards
his
unexpected
visitor
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
lazily
at
him
for
some
half
-
dozen
seconds
without
any
aspect
of
surprise
or
recognition
;
then
suddenly
jumped
up
,
and
with
a
great
oath
pronounced
his
name
.
  
<EOS>
"
Keep
off
,
brother
,
keep
off
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Dennis
,
dodging
behind
the
chair
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
do
me
a
mischief
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
a
prisoner
like
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
n't
the
free
use
of
my
limbs
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
quite
an
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
hurt
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
whined
out
the
last
three
words
in
such
piteous
accents
,
that
Hugh
,
who
had
dragged
away
the
chair
,
and
aimed
a
blow
at
him
with
it
,
checked
himself
,
and
bade
him
get
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
get
up
certainly
,
brother
,
"
cried
Dennis
,
anxious
to
propitiate
him
by
any
means
in
his
power
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
comply
with
any
request
of
yours
,
I
'm
sure
.
 
<EOS>
There
---
I
'm
up
now
.
 
<EOS>
What
can
I
do
for
you
?
 
<EOS>
Only
say
the
word
,
and
I
'll
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
can
you
do
for
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Hugh
,
clutching
him
by
the
collar
with
both
hands
,
and
shaking
him
as
though
he
were
bent
on
stopping
his
breath
by
that
means
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
done
for
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
best
.
 
<EOS>
The
best
that
could
be
done
,
"
returned
the
hangman
.
  
<EOS>
Hugh
made
him
no
answer
,
but
shaking
him
in
his
strong
grip
until
his
teeth
chattered
in
his
head
,
cast
him
down
upon
the
floor
,
and
flung
himself
on
the
bench
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
it
was
n't
for
the
comfort
it
is
to
me
,
to
see
you
here
,
"
he
muttered
,
"
I
'd
have
crushed
your
head
against
it
;
I
would
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
some
time
before
Dennis
had
breath
enough
to
speak
,
but
as
soon
as
he
could
resume
his
propitiatory
strain
,
he
did
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
the
best
that
could
be
done
,
brother
,
"
he
whined
;
"
I
did
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
forced
with
two
bayonets
<EOS>
and
I
do
n't
know
how
many
bullets
on
each
side
of
me
,
to
point
you
out
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
had
n't
been
taken
,
you
'd
have
been
shot
;
and
what
a
sight
that
would
have
been
---
 
a
fine
young
man
like
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
it
be
a
better
sight
now
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Hugh
,
raising
his
head
,
with
such
a
fierce
expression
,
that
the
other
durst
not
answer
him
just
then
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
deal
better
,
"
said
Dennis
meekly
,
after
a
pause
.
 
<EOS>
"
First
,
there
's
all
the
chances
of
the
law
,
and
they
're
five
hundred
strong
.
 
<EOS>
We
may
get
off
scot
-
free
.
 
<EOS>
Unlikelier
things
than
that
have
come
to
pass
.
 
<EOS>
Even
if
we
should
n't
,
and
the
chances
fail
,
we
can
but
be
worked
off
once
:
and
when
it
's
well
done
,
it
's
so
neat
,
<EOS>
so
skilful
,
so
captiwating
,
if
that
do
n't
seem
too
strong
a
word
,
that
you
'd
hardly
believe
it
could
be
brought
to
sich
perfection
.
<EOS>
Kill
one
's
fellow
-
creeturs
off
,
with
muskets
!
<EOS>
---
Pah
!
"
and
his
nature
so
revolted
at
the
bare
idea
,
that
he
spat
upon
the
dungeon
pavement
.
  
<EOS>
His
warming
on
this
topic
,
which
to
one
unacquainted
with
his
pursuits
and
tastes
appeared
like
courage
;
together
with
his
artful
suppression
of
his
own
secret
hopes
,
and
mention
of
himself
as
being
in
the
same
condition
with
Hugh
;
did
more
to
soothe
that
ruffian
than
the
most
elaborate
arguments
could
have
done
,
or
the
most
abject
submission
.
 
<EOS>
He
rested
his
arms
upon
his
knees
,
and
stooping
forward
,
looked
from
beneath
his
shaggy
hair
at
Dennis
,
with
something
of
a
smile
upon
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
fact
is
,
brother
,
"
said
the
hangman
,
in
a
tone
of
greater
confidence
,
"
that
you
got
into
bad
company
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
that
was
with
you
was
looked
after
more
than
you
,
and
it
was
him
I
wanted
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
me
,
what
have
I
got
by
it
?
 
<EOS>
Here
we
are
,
in
one
and
the
same
plight
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Lookee
,
rascal
,
"
said
Hugh
,
contracting
his
brows
,
"
I
'm
not
altogether
such
a
shallow
blade
<EOS>
but
I
know
you
expected
to
get
something
by
it
,
or
you
would
n't
have
done
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
's
done
,
and
you
're
here
,
and
it
will
soon
be
all
over
with
you
and
me
;
and
I
'd
as
soon
die
as
live
,
or
live
as
die
.
 
<EOS>
Why
should
I
trouble
myself
to
have
revenge
on
you
?
 
<EOS>
To
eat
,
and
drink
,
and
go
to
sleep
,
as
long
as
I
stay
here
,
is
all
I
care
for
.
 
<EOS>
If
there
was
but
a
little
more
sun
to
bask
in
,
than
can
find
its
way
into
this
cursed
place
,
I
'd
lie
in
it
all
day
,
and
not
trouble
myself
to
sit
or
stand
up
once
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
all
the
care
I
have
for
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Why
should
I
care
for
YOU
?
"
  
<EOS>
Finishing
this
speech
with
a
growl
like
the
yawn
of
a
wild
beast
,
he
stretched
himself
upon
the
bench
again
,
and
closed
his
eyes
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
After
looking
at
him
in
silence
for
some
moments
,
Dennis
,
who
was
greatly
relieved
to
find
him
in
this
mood
,
drew
the
chair
towards
his
rough
couch
and
sat
down
near
him
---
taking
the
precaution
,
however
,
to
keep
out
of
the
range
of
his
brawny
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
said
,
brother
;
nothing
could
be
better
said
,
"
he
ventured
to
observe
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
'll
eat
and
drink
of
the
best
,
and
sleep
our
best
,
and
make
the
best
of
it
every
way
.
 
<EOS>
Anything
can
be
got
for
money
.
<EOS>
Let
's
spend
it
merrily
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
"
said
Hugh
,
coiling
himself
into
a
new
position
.
<EOS>
---
"
Where
is
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
they
took
mine
from
me
at
the
lodge
,
"
said
Mr
Dennis
;
"
but
mine
's
a
peculiar
case
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
?
 
<EOS>
They
took
mine
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
then
,
I
tell
you
what
,
brother
,
"
Dennis
began
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
look
up
your
friends
---
"
  
"
My
friends
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Hugh
,
starting
up
and
resting
on
his
hands
.
<EOS>
"
Where
are
my
friends
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
relations
then
,
"
said
Dennis
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
ha
ha
!
"
laughed
Hugh
,
waving
one
arm
above
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
talks
of
friends
to
me
---
talks
of
relations
to
a
man
whose
mother
died
the
death
in
store
for
her
son
,
and
left
him
,
a
hungry
brat
,
without
a
face
he
knew
in
all
the
world
!
 
<EOS>
He
talks
of
this
to
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Brother
,
"
cried
the
hangman
,
whose
features
underwent
a
sudden
change
,
"
you
do
n't
mean
to
say
---
"
  
"
I
mean
to
say
,
"
Hugh
interposed
,
"
that
they
hung
her
up
at
Tyburn
.
<EOS>
What
was
good
enough
for
her
,
is
good
enough
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
Let
them
do
the
like
by
me
as
soon
as
they
please
---
the
sooner
the
better
.
 
<EOS>
Say
no
more
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
going
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
want
to
speak
to
you
;
I
want
to
hear
more
about
that
,
"
said
Dennis
,
changing
colour
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
're
a
wise
man
,
"
growled
Hugh
,
raising
his
head
to
look
at
him
with
a
frown
,
"
you
'll
hold
your
tongue
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
I
'm
going
to
sleep
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dennis
venturing
to
say
something
more
in
spite
of
this
caution
,
the
desperate
fellow
struck
at
him
with
all
his
force
,
and
missing
him
,
lay
down
again
with
many
muttered
oaths
and
imprecations
,
and
turned
his
face
towards
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
After
two
or
three
ineffectual
twitches
at
his
dress
,
which
he
was
hardy
enough
to
venture
upon
,
notwithstanding
his
dangerous
humour
,
Mr
Dennis
,
who
burnt
,
for
reasons
of
his
own
,
to
pursue
the
conversation
,
had
no
alternative
but
to
sit
as
patiently
as
he
could
:
waiting
his
further
pleasure
.

Chapter
75
    
A
month
has
elapsed
,
---
and
we
stand
in
the
bedchamber
of
Sir
John
Chester
.
 
<EOS>
Through
the
half
-
opened
window
,
the
Temple
Garden
looks
green
and
pleasant
;
the
placid
river
,
gay
with
boat
and
barge
,
and
dimpled
with
the
plash
of
many
an
oar
,
sparkles
in
the
distance
;
the
sky
is
blue
and
clear
;
and
the
summer
air
steals
gently
in
,
filling
the
room
with
perfume
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
town
,
the
smoky
town
,
is
radiant
.
 
<EOS>
High
roofs
and
steeple
-
tops
,
wo
nt
to
look
black
and
sullen
,
smile
a
cheerful
grey
;
every
old
gilded
vane
,
and
ball
,
and
cross
,
glitters
anew
in
the
bright
morning
sun
;
and
,
high
among
them
all
,
St
Paul
's
towers
up
,
showing
its
lofty
crest
in
burnished
gold
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
John
was
breakfasting
in
bed
.
 
<EOS>
His
chocolate
and
toast
stood
upon
a
little
table
at
his
elbow
;
books
and
newspapers
lay
ready
to
his
hand
,
upon
the
coverlet
;
and
,
sometimes
pausing
to
glance
with
an
air
of
tranquil
satisfaction
round
the
well
-
ordered
room
,
and
sometimes
to
gaze
indolently
at
the
summer
sky
,
he
ate
,
and
drank
,
and
read
the
news
luxuriously
.
  
<EOS>
The
cheerful
influence
of
the
morning
seemed
to
have
some
effect
,
even
upon
his
equable
temper
.
 
<EOS>
His
manner
was
unusually
gay
;
his
smile
more
placid
and
agreeable
than
usual
;
his
voice
more
clear
and
pleasant
.
 
<EOS>
He
laid
down
the
newspaper
he
had
been
reading
;
leaned
back
upon
his
pillow
with
the
air
of
one
who
resigned
himself
to
a
train
of
charming
recollections
;
and
after
a
pause
,
soliloquised
as
follows
:
  
"
And
my
friend
the
centaur
,
goes
the
way
of
his
mamma
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
surprised
.
 
<EOS>
And
his
mysterious
friend
Mr
Dennis
,
likewise
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
surprised
.
 
<EOS>
And
my
old
postman
,
the
exceedingly
free
-
and
-
easy
young
madman
of
Chigwell
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
quite
rejoiced
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
the
very
best
thing
that
could
possibly
happen
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
After
delivering
himself
of
these
remarks
,
he
fell
again
into
his
smiling
train
of
reflection
;
from
which
he
roused
himself
at
length
to
finish
his
chocolate
,
which
was
getting
cold
,
and
ring
the
bell
for
more
.
  
<EOS>
The
new
supply
arriving
,
he
took
the
cup
from
his
servant
's
hand
;
and
saying
,
with
a
charming
affability
,
"
I
am
obliged
to
you
,
Peak
,
"
dismissed
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
remarkable
circumstance
,
"
he
mused
,
dallying
lazily
with
the
teaspoon
,
"
that
my
friend
the
madman
should
have
been
within
an
ace
of
escaping
,
on
his
trial
;
and
it
was
a
good
stroke
of
chance
(
or
,
as
the
world
would
say
,
a
providential
occurrence
)
that
the
brother
of
my
Lord
Mayor
should
have
been
in
court
,
with
other
country
justices
,
into
whose
very
dense
heads
curiosity
had
penetrated
.
 
<EOS>
For
though
the
brother
of
my
Lord
Mayor
was
decidedly
wrong
;
and
established
his
near
relationship
to
that
amusing
person
beyond
all
doubt
,
in
stating
that
my
friend
was
sane
,
and
had
,
to
his
knowledge
,
wandered
about
the
country
with
a
vagabond
parent
,
avowing
revolutionary
and
rebellious
sentiments
;
I
am
not
the
less
obliged
to
him
for
volunteering
that
evidence
.
 
<EOS>
These
insane
creatures
make
such
very
odd
and
embarrassing
remarks
,
that
they
really
ought
to
be
hanged
for
the
comfort
of
society
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
country
justice
had
indeed
turned
the
wavering
scale
against
poor
Barnaby
,
and
solved
the
doubt
that
trembled
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
Grip
little
thought
how
much
he
had
to
answer
for
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
will
be
a
singular
party
,
"
said
Sir
John
,
leaning
his
head
upon
his
hand
,
and
sipping
his
chocolate
;
"
a
very
curious
party
.
<EOS>
The
hangman
himself
;
the
centaur
;
and
the
madman
.
 
<EOS>
The
centaur
would
make
a
very
handsome
preparation
in
Surgeons
'
Hall
,
and
would
benefit
science
extremely
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
they
have
taken
care
to
bespeak
him
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Peak
,
I
am
not
at
home
,
of
course
,
to
anybody
but
the
hairdresser
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
reminder
to
his
servant
was
called
forth
by
a
knock
at
the
door
,
which
the
man
hastened
to
open
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
prolonged
murmur
of
question
and
answer
,
he
returned
;
and
as
he
cautiously
closed
the
room
-
door
behind
him
,
a
man
was
heard
to
cough
in
the
passage
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
it
is
of
no
use
,
Peak
,
"
said
Sir
John
,
raising
his
hand
in
deprecation
of
his
delivering
any
message
;
"
I
am
not
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
possibly
hear
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
you
I
was
not
at
home
,
and
my
word
is
sacred
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
never
do
as
you
are
desired
?
"
  
<EOS>
Having
nothing
to
oppose
to
this
reproof
,
the
man
was
about
to
withdraw
,
when
the
visitor
who
had
given
occasion
to
it
,
probably
rendered
impatient
by
delay
,
knocked
with
his
knuckles
at
the
chamber
-
door
,
and
called
out
that
he
had
urgent
business
with
Sir
John
Chester
,
which
admitted
of
no
delay
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
him
in
,
"
said
Sir
John
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
good
fellow
,
"
he
added
,
when
the
door
was
opened
,
"
how
come
you
to
intrude
yourself
in
this
extraordinary
manner
upon
the
privacy
of
a
gentleman
?
 
<EOS>
How
can
you
be
so
wholly
destitute
of
self
-
respect
as
to
be
guilty
of
such
remarkable
ill
-
breeding
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
business
,
Sir
John
,
is
not
of
a
common
kind
,
I
do
assure
you
,
"
returned
the
person
he
addressed
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
have
taken
any
uncommon
course
to
get
admission
to
you
,
I
hope
I
shall
be
pardoned
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Well
!
we
shall
see
;
we
shall
see
,
"
returned
Sir
John
,
whose
face
cleared
up
when
he
saw
who
it
was
,
and
whose
prepossessing
smile
was
now
restored
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
we
have
met
before
,
"
he
added
in
his
winning
tone
,
"
but
really
I
forget
your
name
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
name
is
Gabriel
Varden
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Varden
,
of
course
,
Varden
,
"
returned
Sir
John
,
tapping
his
forehead
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
how
very
defective
my
memory
becomes
!
 
<EOS>
Varden
to
be
sure
---
<EOS>
Mr
Varden
the
locksmith
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
a
charming
wife
,
Mr
Varden
,
and
a
most
beautiful
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
well
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Gabriel
thanked
him
,
and
said
they
were
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
rejoice
to
hear
it
,
"
said
Sir
John
.
 
<EOS>
"
Commend
me
to
them
when
you
return
,
and
say
that
I
wished
I
were
fortunate
enough
to
convey
,
myself
,
the
salute
which
I
entrust
you
to
deliver
.
 
<EOS>
And
what
,
"
he
asked
very
sweetly
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
"
can
I
do
for
you
?
 
<EOS>
You
may
command
me
freely
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
,
Sir
John
,
"
said
Gabriel
,
with
some
pride
in
his
manner
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
have
come
to
ask
no
favour
of
you
,
though
I
come
on
business
.
<EOS>
---
Private
,
"
he
added
,
with
a
glance
at
the
man
who
stood
looking
on
,
"
and
very
pressing
business
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
say
you
are
the
more
welcome
for
being
independent
,
and
having
nothing
to
ask
of
me
,
"
returned
Sir
John
,
graciously
,
"
<EOS>
for
I
should
have
been
happy
to
render
you
a
service
;
still
,
you
are
welcome
on
any
terms
.
 
<EOS>
Oblige
me
with
some
more
chocolate
,
Peak
,
and
do
n't
wait
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
man
retired
,
and
left
them
alone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
John
,
"
said
Gabriel
,
"
I
am
a
working
-
man
,
and
have
been
so
,
all
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
do
n't
prepare
you
enough
for
what
I
have
to
tell
;
if
I
come
to
the
point
too
abruptly
;
and
give
you
a
shock
,
which
a
gentleman
could
have
spared
you
,
or
at
all
events
lessened
very
much
;
I
hope
you
will
give
me
credit
for
meaning
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
to
be
careful
and
considerate
,
and
I
trust
that
in
a
straightforward
person
like
me
,
you
'll
take
the
will
for
the
deed

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Varden
,
"
returned
the
other
,
perfectly
composed
under
this
exordium
;
"
I
beg
you
'll
take
a
chair

<EOS>
Chocolate
,
perhaps
,
you
do
n't
relish

<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
it
IS
an
acquired
taste
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
John
,
"
said
Gabriel
,
who
had
acknowledged
with
a
bow
the
invitation
to
be
seated
,
but
had
not
availed
himself
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
John
"
<EOS>
---
he
dropped
his
voice
and
drew
nearer
to
the
bed
---
"
I
am
just
now
come
from
Newgate
---
"
  
"
Good
Gad
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Sir
John
,
hastily
sitting
up
in
bed
;
"
from
Newgate
,
Mr
Varden
!
 
<EOS>
How
could
you
be
so
very
imprudent
as
to
come
from
Newgate
!
 
<EOS>
Newgate
,
where
there
are
jail
-
fevers
,
and
ragged
people
,
and
bare
-
footed
men
and
women
,
and
a
thousand
horrors
!
<EOS>
Peak
,
bring
the
camphor
,
quick
!
 
<EOS>
Heaven
and
earth
,
Mr
Varden
,
my
dear
,
good
soul
<EOS>
,
how
COULD
you
come
from
Newgate
?
"
  
<EOS>
Gabriel
returned
no
answer
,
but
looked
on
in
silence
while
Peak
(
who
had
entered
with
the
hot
chocolate
)
ran
to
a
drawer
,
and
returning
with
a
bottle
,
sprinkled
his
master
's
dressing
-
gown
and
the
bedding
;
and
besides
moistening
the
locksmith
himself
,
plentifully
,
described
a
circle
round
about
him
on
the
carpet
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
done
this
,
he
again
retired
;
and
Sir
John
,
reclining
in
an
easy
attitude
upon
his
pillow
,
once
more
turned
a
smiling
face
towards
his
visitor
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
forgive
me
,
<EOS>
Mr
Varden
,
I
am
sure
,
for
being
at
first
a
little
sensitive
both
on
your
account
and
my
own
.
 
<EOS>
I
confess
<EOS>
I
was
startled
,
notwithstanding
your
delicate
exordium
.
 
<EOS>
Might
I
ask
you
to
do
me
the
favour
not
to
approach
any
nearer
?
<EOS>
---
You
have
really
come
from
Newgate
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
locksmith
inclined
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
-
deed
!
 
<EOS>
And
now
,
Mr
Varden
,
all
exaggeration
and
embellishment
apart
,
"
said
Sir
John
Chester
,
confidentially
,
as
he
sipped
his
chocolate
,
"
what
kind
of
place
IS
Newgate
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
strange
place
,
Sir
John
,
"
returned
the
locksmith
,
"
of
a
sad
and
doleful
kind
.
 
<EOS>
A
strange
place
,
where
many
strange
things
are
heard
and
seen
;
but
few
more
strange
than
that
I
come
to
tell
you
of
.
<EOS>
The
case
is
urgent
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sent
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
---
<EOS>
no
,
no
---
not
from
the
jail
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
Sir
John
;
from
the
jail
.
"
  
"
And
my
good
,
credulous
,
open
-
hearted
friend
,
"
said
Sir
John
,
setting
down
his
cup
,
and
laughing
,
---
"
by
whom
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
a
man
called
Dennis
---
for
many
years
the
hangman
,
and
to
-
morrow
morning
the
hanged
,
"
returned
the
locksmith
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
John
had
expected
---
had
been
quite
certain
from
the
first
---
that
he
would
say
he
had
come
from
Hugh
,
and
was
prepared
to
meet
him
on
that
point
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
answer
occasioned
him
a
degree
of
astonishment
,
which
,
for
the
moment
,
he
could
not
,
with
all
his
command
of
feature
,
prevent
his
face
from
expressing
.
 
<EOS>
He
quickly
subdued
it
,
however
,
and
said
in
the
same
light
tone
:
  
"
<EOS>
And
what
does
the
gentleman
require
of
me
?
 
<EOS>
My
memory
may
be
at
fault
again
,
but
I
do
n't
recollect
that
I
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
an
introduction
to
him
,
or
that
I
ever
numbered
him
among
my
personal
friends
<EOS>
,
I
do
assure
you
,
Mr
Varden
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
John
,
"
returned
the
locksmith
,
gravely
,
"
I
will
tell
you
,
as
nearly
as
I
can
,
in
the
words
he
used
to
me
,
what
he
desires
that
you
should
know
,
and
what
you
ought
to
know
without
a
moment
's
loss
of
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
John
Chester
settled
himself
in
a
position
of
greater
repose
,
and
looked
at
his
visitor
with
an
expression
of
face
which
seemed
to
say
,
"
This
is
an
amusing
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
hear
him
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
have
seen
in
the
newspapers
,
sir
,
"
said
Gabriel
,
pointing
to
the
one
which
lay
by
his
side
,
"
that
I
was
a
witness
against
this
man
upon
his
trial
some
days
since
;
and
that
it
was
not
his
fault
<EOS>
I
was
alive
,
and
able
to
speak
to
what
I
knew
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
MAY
have
seen
!
"
cried
Sir
John
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mr
Varden
,
you
are
quite
a
public
character
,
and
live
in
all
men
's
thoughts
most
deservedly
.
<EOS>
Nothing
can
exceed
the
interest
with
which
I
read
your
testimony
,
and
remembered
that
I
had
the
pleasure
of
a
slight
acquaintance
with
you
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
-I
hope
we
shall
have
your
portrait
published
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
morning
,
sir
,
"
said
the
locksmith
,
taking
no
notice
of
these
compliments
,
"
early
this
morning
,
a
message
was
brought
to
me
from
Newgate
,
at
this
man
's
request
,
desiring
that
I
would
go
and
see
him
,
for
he
had
something
particular
to
communicate
.
 
<EOS>
I
need
n't
tell
you
that
he
is
no
friend
of
mine
,
and
that
I
had
never
seen
him
,
until
the
rioters
beset
my
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
John
fanned
himself
gently
with
the
newspaper
,
and
nodded
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
knew
,
however
,
from
the
general
report
,
"
resumed
Gabriel
,
"
that
the
order
for
his
execution
to
-
morrow
,
went
down
to
the
prison
last
night
;
and
looking
upon
him
as
a
dying
man
,
I
complied
with
his
request
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
quite
a
Christian
,
Mr
Varden
,
"
said
Sir
John
;
"
and
in
that
amiable
capacity
,
you
increase
my
desire
that
you
should
take
a
chair
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
said
,
"
continued
Gabriel
,
looking
steadily
at
the
knight
,
"
that
he
had
sent
to
me
,
because
he
had
no
friend
or
companion
in
the
whole
world
(
being
the
common
hangman
)
,
and
because
he
believed
,
from
the
way
in
which
I
had
given
my
evidence
,
that
I
was
an
honest
man
,
and
would
act
truly
by
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
that
,
being
shunned
by
every
one
who
knew
his
calling
,
even
by
people
of
the
lowest
and
most
wretched
grade
,
and
finding
,
when
he
joined
the
rioters
,
that
the
men
he
acted
with
had
no
suspicion
of
it
(
which
I
believe
is
true
enough
,
for
a
poor
fool
of
an
old
'
prentice
of
mine
was
one
of
them
)
,
he
had
kept
his
own
counsel
,
up
to
the
time
of
his
being
taken
and
put
in
jail
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
discreet
of
Mr
Dennis
,
"
observed
Sir
John
with
a
slight
yawn
,
though
still
with
the
utmost
affability
,
"
but
---
except
for
your
admirable
and
lucid
manner
of
telling
it
,
which
is
perfect
---
not
very
interesting
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
,
"
pursued
the
locksmith
,
quite
unabashed
and
wholly
regardless
of
these
interruptions
,
"
when
he
was
taken
to
the
jail
,
he
found
that
his
fellow
-
prisoner
,
in
the
same
room
,
was
a
young
man
,
Hugh
by
name
,
a
leader
in
the
riots
,
who
had
been
betrayed
and
given
up
by
himself
.
 
<EOS>
From
something
which
fell
from
this
unhappy
creature
in
the
course
of
the
angry
words
they
had
at
meeting
,
he
discovered
that
his
mother
had
suffered
the
death
to
which
they
both
are
now
condemned
.
<EOS>
---
The
time
is
very
short
,
Sir
John
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
knight
laid
down
his
paper
fan
,
replaced
his
cup
upon
the
table
at
his
side
,
and
,
saving
for
the
smile
that
lurked
about
his
mouth
,
looked
at
the
locksmith
with
as
much
steadiness
as
the
locksmith
looked
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
have
been
in
prison
now
,
a
month
.
 
<EOS>
One
conversation
led
to
many
more
;
and
the
hangman
soon
found
,
from
a
comparison
of
time
,
and
place
,
and
dates
,
that
he
had
executed
the
sentence
of
the
law
upon
this
woman
,
himself
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
been
tempted
by
want
---
as
so
many
people
are
---
into
the
easy
crime
of
passing
forged
notes
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
young
and
handsome
;
and
the
traders
who
employ
men
,
women
,
and
children
in
this
traffic
,
looked
upon
her
as
one
who
was
well
adapted
for
their
business
,
and
who
would
probably
go
on
without
suspicion
for
a
long
time
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
were
mistaken
;
for
she
was
stopped
in
the
commission
of
her
very
first
offence
,
and
died
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
of
gipsy
blood
,
Sir
John
---
<EOS>
"
  
It
might
have
been
the
effect
of
a
passing
cloud
which
obscured
the
sun
,
and
cast
a
shadow
on
his
face
;
but
the
knight
turned
deadly
pale
.
 
<EOS>
Still
he
met
the
locksmith
's
eye
,
as
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
was
of
gipsy
blood
,
Sir
John
,
"
repeated
Gabriel
,
"
and
had
a
high
,
free
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
and
her
good
looks
,
and
her
lofty
manner
,
interested
some
gentlemen
who
were
easily
moved
by
dark
eyes
;
and
efforts
were
made
to
save
her
.
 
<EOS>
They
might
have
been
successful
,
if
she
would
have
given
them
any
clue
to
her
history
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
never
would
,
or
did
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
reason
to
suspect
that
she
would
make
an
attempt
upon
her
life
.
 
<EOS>
A
watch
was
set
upon
her
night
and
day
;
and
from
that
time
she
never
spoke
again
---
"
  
Sir
John
stretched
out
his
hand
towards
his
cup
.
 
<EOS>
The
locksmith
going
on
,
arrested
it
half
-
way
.
   
<EOS>
---
"
<EOS>
Until
she
had
but
a
minute
to
live
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
broke
silence
,
and
said
,
in
a
low
firm
voice
which
no
one
heard
but
this
executioner
,
for
all
other
living
creatures
had
retired
and
left
her
to
her
fate
,
"
If
I
had
a
dagger
within
these
fingers
and
he
was
within
my
reach
,
I
would
strike
him
dead
before
me
,
even
now
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
man
asked
"
Who
?
"
 
<EOS>
She
said
,
"
The
father
of
her
boy
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
Sir
John
drew
back
his
outstretched
hand
,
and
seeing
that
the
locksmith
paused
,
signed
to
him
with
easy
politeness
and
without
any
new
appearance
of
emotion
,
to
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
the
first
word
she
had
ever
spoken
,
from
which
it
could
be
understood
that
she
had
any
relative
on
earth
.
 
<EOS>
"
Was
the
child
alive
?
"
he
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
asked
her
where
it
was
,
its
name
,
and
whether
she
had
any
wish
respecting
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
<EOS>
but
one
<EOS>
,
she
said
.
<EOS>
It
was
that
the
boy
might
live
and
grow
,
in
utter
ignorance
of
his
father
,
so
that
no
arts
might
teach
him
to
be
gentle
and
forgiving
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
became
a
man
,
she
trusted
to
the
God
of
their
tribe
to
bring
the
father
and
the
son
together
,
and
revenge
her
through
her
child
.
 
<EOS>
He
asked
her
other
questions
,
but
she
spoke
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
says
,
she
scarcely
said
this
much
,
to
him
,
but
stood
with
her
face
turned
upwards
to
the
sky
,
and
never
looked
towards
him
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
John
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
;
glanced
approvingly
at
an
elegant
little
sketch
,
entitled
"
Nature
,
"
on
the
wall
;
and
raising
his
eyes
to
the
locksmith
's
face
again
,
said
,
with
an
air
of
courtesy
and
patronage
,
"
You
were
observing
,
Mr
Varden
---
<EOS>
"
  
"
That
she
never
,
"
returned
the
locksmith
,
who
was
not
to
be
diverted
by
any
artifice
from
his
firm
manner
,
and
his
steady
gaze
,
"
that
she
never
looked
towards
him
once
,
Sir
John
;
and
so
she
died
,
and
he
forgot
her
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
some
years
afterwards
,
a
man
was
sentenced
to
die
the
same
death
,
who
was
a
gipsy
too
;
a
sunburnt
,
swarthy
fellow
,
almost
a
wild
man
;
and
while
he
lay
in
prison
,
under
sentence
,
he
,
who
had
seen
the
hangman
more
than
once
while
he
was
free
,
cut
an
image
of
him
on
his
stick
,
by
way
of
braving
death
,
and
showing
those
who
attended
on
him
,
how
little
he
cared
or
thought
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
gave
this
stick
into
his
hands
at
Tyburn
,
and
told
him
then
,
that
the
woman
I
have
spoken
of
had
left
her
own
people
to
join
a
fine
gentleman
,
and
that
,
being
deserted
by
him
,
and
cast
off
by
her
old
friends
,
she
had
sworn
within
her
own
proud
breast
,
that
whatever
her
misery
might
be
,
she
would
ask
no
help
of
any
human
being
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
him
that
she
had
kept
her
word
to
the
last
;
and
that
,
meeting
even
him
in
the
streets
---
he
had
been
fond
of
her
once
<EOS>
,
it
seems
---
she
had
slipped
from
him
by
a
trick
,
and
he
never
saw
her
again
,
until
,
being
in
one
of
the
frequent
crowds
at
Tyburn
,
with
some
of
his
rough
companions
,
he
had
been
driven
almost
mad
by
seeing
,
in
the
criminal
under
another
name
,
whose
death
he
had
come
to
witness
,
herself
.
 
<EOS>
Standing
in
the
same
place
in
which
she
had
stood
,
he
told
the
hangman
this
,
and
told
him
,
too
,
her
real
name
,
which
only
her
own
people
and
the
gentleman
for
whose
sake
she
had
left
them
,
knew
.
 
<EOS>
That
name
he
will
tell
again
,
Sir
John
,
to
none
but
you
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
none
but
me
!
"
exclaimed
the
knight
,
pausing
in
the
act
of
raising
his
cup
to
his
lips
with
a
perfectly
steady
hand
,
and
curling
up
his
little
finger
for
the
better
display
of
a
brilliant
ring
with
which
it
was
ornamented
:
"
but
me
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
My
dear
Mr
Varden
,
how
very
preposterous
,
to
select
me
for
his
confidence
!
 
<EOS>
With
you
at
his
elbow
,
too
,
who
are
so
perfectly
trustworthy
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
John
,
Sir
John
,
"
returned
the
locksmith
,
"
at
twelve
tomorrow
,
these
men
die
.
 
<EOS>
Hear
the
few
words
I
have
to
add
,
and
do
not
hope
to
deceive
me
;
for
though
I
am
a
plain
man
of
humble
station
,
and
you
are
a
gentleman
of
rank
and
learning
,
the
truth
raises
me
to
your
level
,
and
I
KNOW
that
you
anticipate
the
disclosure
with
which
I
am
about
to
end
,
and
that
you
believe
this
doomed
man
,
Hugh
,
to
be
your
son
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
"
said
Sir
John
,
bantering
him
with
a
gay
air
;
"
the
wild
gentleman
,
who
died
so
suddenly
,
scarcely
went
as
far
as
that
,
I
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
did
not
,
"
returned
the
locksmith
,
"
for
she
had
bound
him
by
some
pledge
,
known
only
to
these
people
,
and
which
the
worst
among
them
respect
,
not
to
tell
your
name
:
but
,
in
a
fantastic
pattern
on
the
stick
,
he
had
carved
some
letters
,
and
when
the
hangman
asked
it
,
he
bade
him
,
especially
if
he
should
ever
meet
with
her
son
in
after
life
,
remember
that
place
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
place
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Chester
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
knight
finished
his
cup
of
chocolate
with
an
appearance
of
infinite
relish
,
and
carefully
wiped
his
lips
upon
his
handkerchief
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
John
,
"
said
the
locksmith
,
"
this
is
all
that
has
been
told
to
me
;
but
since
these
two
men
have
been
left
for
death
,
they
have
conferred
together
closely
.
 
<EOS>
See
them
,
and
hear
what
they
can
add
.
<EOS>
See
this
Dennis
,
and
learn
from
him
what
he
has
not
trusted
to
me
.
<EOS>
If
you
,
who
hold
the
clue
to
all
,
want
corroboration
(
which
you
do
not
)
,
the
means
are
easy
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
to
what
,
"
said
Sir
John
Chester
,
rising
on
his
elbow
,
after
smoothing
the
pillow
for
its
reception
;
"
my
dear
,
good
-
natured
,
estimable
Mr
Varden
---
with
whom
I
can
not
be
angry
if
I
would
---
to
what
does
all
this
tend
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
take
you
for
a
man
,
Sir
John
,
and
I
suppose
it
tends
to
some
pleading
of
natural
affection
in
your
breast
,
"
returned
the
locksmith
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
to
the
straining
of
every
nerve
,
and
the
exertion
of
all
the
influence
you
have
,
or
can
make
,
in
behalf
of
your
miserable
son
,
and
the
man
who
has
disclosed
his
existence
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
worst
,
I
suppose
to
your
seeing
your
son
,
and
awakening
him
to
a
sense
of
his
crime
and
danger
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
no
such
sense
now
.
 
<EOS>
Think
what
his
life
must
have
been
,
when
he
said
in
my
hearing
,
that
if
I
moved
you
to
anything
,
it
would
be
to
hastening
his
death
,
and
ensuring
his
silence
,
if
you
had
it
in
your
power
!
"
  
"
And
have
you
,
my
good
Mr
Varden
,
"
said
Sir
John
in
a
tone
of
mild
reproof
,
"
have
you
really
lived
to
your
present
age
,
and
remained
so
very
simple
and
credulous
,
as
to
approach
a
gentleman
of
established
character
with
such
credentials
as
these
,
from
desperate
men
in
their
last
extremity
,
catching
at
any
straw
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
dear
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
fie
,
fie
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
locksmith
was
going
to
interpose
,
but
he
stopped
him
:
  
"
On
any
other
subject
,
Mr
Varden
,
I
shall
be
delighted
<EOS>
---
I
shall
be
charmed
---
to
converse
with
you
,
but
I
owe
it
to
my
own
character
not
to
pursue
this
topic
for
another
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Think
better
of
it
,
sir
,
when
I
am
gone
,
"
returned
the
locksmith
;
"
think
better
of
it
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Although
you
have
,
thrice
within
as
many
weeks
,
turned
your
lawful
son
,
Mr
Edward
,
from
your
door
,
you
may
have
time
,
you
may
have
years
to
make
your
peace
with
HIM
,
Sir
John
:
but
that
twelve
o'clock
will
soon
be
here
,
and
soon
be
past
for
ever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
very
much
,
"
returned
the
knight
,
kissing
his
delicate
hand
to
the
locksmith
,
"
for
your
guileless
advice
;
and
I
only
wish
,
my
good
soul
,
although
your
simplicity
is
quite
captivating
,
that
you
had
a
little
more
worldly
wisdom
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
so
much
regretted
the
arrival
of
my
hairdresser
as
I
do
at
this
moment
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
you
!
 
<EOS>
Good
morning
!
 
<EOS>
You
'll
not
forget
my
message
to
the
ladies
,
Mr
Varden
?
 
<EOS>
Peak
,
show
Mr
Varden
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Gabriel
said
no
more
,
but
gave
the
knight
a
parting
look
,
and
left
him
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
quitted
the
room
,
Sir
John
's
face
changed
;
and
the
smile
gave
place
to
a
haggard
and
anxious
expression
,
like
that
of
a
weary
actor
jaded
by
the
performance
of
a
difficult
part
.
 
<EOS>
He
rose
from
his
bed
with
a
heavy
sigh
,
and
wrapped
himself
in
his
morning
-
gown
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
she
kept
her
word
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
was
constant
to
her
threat
!
<EOS>
I
would
I
had
never
seen
that
dark
face
of
hers
,
---
I
might
have
read
these
consequences
in
it
,
from
the
first
.
 
<EOS>
This
affair
would
make
a
noise
abroad
,
if
it
rested
on
better
evidence
;
but
,
as
it
is
,
and
by
not
joining
the
scattered
links
of
the
chain
,
I
can
afford
to
slight
it
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Extremely
distressing
to
be
the
parent
of
such
an
uncouth
creature
!
 
<EOS>
Still
,
I
gave
him
very
good
advice
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
he
would
certainly
be
hanged
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
done
no
more
if
I
had
known
of
our
relationship
;
and
there
are
a
great
many
fathers
who
have
never
done
as
much
for
THEIR
natural
children
.
<EOS>
---
The
hairdresser
may
come
in
,
Peak
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
hairdresser
came
in
;
and
saw
in
Sir
John
Chester
(
whose
accommodating
conscience
was
soon
quieted
by
the
numerous
precedents
that
occurred
to
him
in
support
of
his
last
observation
)
,
the
same
imperturbable
,
fascinating
,
elegant
gentleman
he
had
seen
yesterday
,
and
many
yesterdays
before
.

Chapter
76
    
<EOS>
As
the
locksmith
walked
slowly
away
from
Sir
John
Chester
's
chambers
,
he
lingered
under
the
trees
which
shaded
the
path
,
almost
hoping
that
he
might
be
summoned
to
return
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
turned
back
thrice
,
and
still
loitered
at
the
corner
,
when
the
clock
struck
twelve
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
solemn
sound
,
and
not
merely
for
its
reference
to
to
-
morrow
;
for
he
knew
that
in
that
chime
the
murderer
's
knell
was
rung
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
seen
him
pass
along
the
crowded
street
,
amidst
the
execration
of
the
throng
;
and
marked
his
quivering
lip
,
and
trembling
limbs
;
the
ashy
hue
upon
his
face
,
his
clammy
brow
,
the
wild
distraction
of
his
eye
---
the
fear
of
death
that
swallowed
up
all
other
thoughts
,
and
gnawed
without
cessation
at
his
heart
and
brain
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
marked
the
wandering
look
,
seeking
for
hope
,
and
finding
,
turn
where
it
would
,
despair
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
seen
the
remorseful
,
pitiful
,
desolate
creature
,
riding
,
with
his
coffin
by
his
side
,
to
the
gibbet
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
that
,
to
the
last
,
he
had
been
an
unyielding
,
obdurate
man
;
that
in
the
savage
terror
of
his
condition
he
had
hardened
,
rather
than
relented
,
to
his
wife
and
child
;
and
that
the
last
words
which
had
passed
his
white
lips
were
curses
on
them
as
his
enemies
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
had
determined
to
be
there
,
and
see
it
done
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
but
the
evidence
of
his
own
senses
could
satisfy
that
gloomy
thirst
for
retribution
which
had
been
gathering
upon
him
for
so
many
years
.
 
<EOS>
The
locksmith
knew
this
,
and
when
the
chimes
had
ceased
to
vibrate
,
hurried
away
to
meet
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
these
two
men
,
"
he
said
,
as
he
went
,
"
I
can
do
no
more
.
<EOS>
Heaven
have
mercy
on
them
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
I
say
I
can
do
no
more
for
them
,
but
whom
can
I
help
?
 
<EOS>
Mary
Rudge
will
have
a
home
,
and
a
firm
friend
when
she
most
wants
one
;
but
Barnaby
---
poor
Barnaby
<EOS>
---
willing
Barnaby
---
what
aid
can
I
render
him
?
 
<EOS>
There
are
many
,
many
men
of
sense
,
God
forgive
me
,
"
cried
the
honest
locksmith
,
stopping
in
a
narrow
count
to
pass
his
hand
across
his
eyes
,
"
I
could
better
afford
to
lose
than
Barnaby
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
always
been
good
friends
,
but
I
never
knew
,
till
now
,
how
much
I
loved
the
lad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
were
not
many
in
the
great
city
who
thought
of
Barnaby
that
day
,
otherwise
than
as
an
actor
in
a
show
which
was
to
take
place
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
the
whole
population
had
had
him
in
their
minds
,
and
had
wished
his
life
to
be
spared
,
not
one
among
them
could
have
done
so
with
a
purer
zeal
or
greater
singleness
of
heart
than
the
good
locksmith
.
  
<EOS>
Barnaby
was
to
die
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
hope
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
the
least
evil
attendant
upon
the
frequent
exhibition
of
this
last
dread
punishment
,
of
Death
,
that
it
hardens
the
minds
of
those
who
deal
it
out
,
and
makes
them
,
though
they
be
amiable
men
in
other
respects
,
indifferent
to
,
or
unconscious
of
,
their
great
responsibility
.
 
<EOS>
The
word
had
gone
forth
that
Barnaby
was
to
die
.
<EOS>
It
went
forth
,
every
month
,
for
lighter
crimes
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
thing
so
common
,
that
very
few
were
startled
by
the
awful
sentence
,
or
cared
to
question
its
propriety
.
 
<EOS>
Just
then
,
too
,
when
the
law
had
been
so
flagrantly
outraged
,
its
dignity
must
be
asserted
.
 
<EOS>
The
symbol
of
its
dignity
,
---
stamped
upon
every
page
of
the
criminal
statute
-
book
,
---
was
the
gallows
;
and
Barnaby
was
to
die
.
  
<EOS>
They
had
tried
to
save
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
locksmith
had
carried
petitions
and
memorials
to
the
fountain
-
head
,
with
his
own
hands
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
well
was
not
one
of
mercy
,
and
Barnaby
was
to
die
.
  
<EOS>
From
the
first
his
mother
had
never
left
him
,
save
at
night
;
and
with
her
beside
him
,
he
was
as
usual
contented
.
 
<EOS>
On
this
last
day
,
he
was
more
elated
and
more
proud
than
he
had
been
yet
;
and
when
she
dropped
the
book
she
had
been
reading
to
him
aloud
,
and
fell
upon
his
neck
,
he
stopped
in
his
busy
task
of
folding
a
piece
of
crape
about
his
hat
,
and
wondered
at
her
anguish
.
 
<EOS>
Grip
uttered
a
feeble
croak
,
half
in
encouragement
,
it
seemed
,
and
half
in
remonstrance
,
but
he
wanted
heart
to
sustain
it
,
and
lapsed
abruptly
into
silence
.
  
<EOS>
With
them
who
stood
upon
the
brink
of
the
great
gulf
which
none
can
see
beyond
,
Time
,
so
soon
to
lose
itself
in
vast
Eternity
,
rolled
on
like
a
mighty
river
,
swollen
and
rapid
as
it
nears
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
morning
but
now
;
they
had
sat
and
talked
together
in
a
dream
;
and
here
was
evening
.
 
<EOS>
The
dreadful
hour
of
separation
,
which
even
yesterday
had
seemed
so
distant
,
was
at
hand
.
  
<EOS>
They
walked
out
into
the
courtyard
,
clinging
to
each
other
,
but
not
speaking
.
 
<EOS>
Barnaby
knew
that
the
jail
was
a
dull
,
sad
,
miserable
place
,
and
looked
forward
to
to
-
morrow
,
as
to
a
passage
from
it
to
something
bright
and
beautiful
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
vague
impression
too
,
that
he
was
expected
to
be
brave
---
that
he
was
a
man
of
great
consequence
,
and
that
the
prison
people
would
be
glad
to
make
him
weep
.
 
<EOS>
He
trod
the
ground
more
firmly
as
he
thought
of
this
,
and
bade
her
take
heart
and
cry
no
more
,
and
feel
how
steady
his
hand
was
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
call
me
silly
,
mother
.
 
<EOS>
They
shall
see
to
-
morrow
!
"
  
<EOS>
Dennis
and
Hugh
were
in
the
courtyard
.
 
<EOS>
Hugh
came
forth
from
his
cell
as
they
did
,
stretching
himself
as
though
he
had
been
sleeping
.
 
<EOS>
Dennis
sat
upon
a
bench
in
a
corner
,
with
his
knees
and
chin
huddled
together
,
and
rocked
himself
to
and
fro
like
a
person
in
severe
pain
.
  
<EOS>
The
mother
and
son
remained
on
one
side
of
the
court
,
and
these
two
men
upon
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
Hugh
strode
up
and
down
,
glancing
fiercely
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
at
the
bright
summer
sky
,
and
looking
round
,
when
he
had
done
so
,
at
the
walls
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
reprieve
,
no
reprieve
!
 
<EOS>
Nobody
comes
near
us
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
only
the
night
left
now
!
"
<EOS>
moaned
Dennis
faintly
,
as
he
wrung
his
hands
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
they
'll
reprieve
me
in
the
night
,
brother
?
 
<EOS>
I
've
known
<EOS>
reprieves
come
in
the
night
,
afore
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
known
<EOS>
'em
come
as
late
as
five
,
six
,
and
seven
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
there
's
a
good
chance
yet
,
---
do
n't
you
?
 
<EOS>
Say
you
do
.
 
<EOS>
Say
you
do
,
young
man
,
"
whined
the
miserable
creature
,
with
an
imploring
gesture
towards
Barnaby
,
"
or
I
shall
go
mad
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Better
be
mad
than
sane
,
here
,
"
said
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
GO
mad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
tell
me
what
you
think
.
 
<EOS>
Somebody
tell
me
what
he
thinks
!
"
cried
the
wretched
object
,
---
so
mean
,
and
wretched
,
and
despicable
,
that
even
Pity
's
self
might
have
turned
away
,
at
sight
of
such
a
being
in
the
likeness
of
a
man
---
"
is
n't
there
a
chance
for
me
,
---
 
is
n't
there
a
good
chance
for
me
?
 
<EOS>
Is
n't
it
likely
they
may
be
doing
this
to
frighten
me
?
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
it
is
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
"
<EOS>
he
almost
shrieked
,
as
he
wrung
his
hands
,
"
wo
n't
anybody
give
me
comfort
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
ought
to
be
the
best
,
instead
of
the
worst
,
"
said
Hugh
,
stopping
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
 
See
the
hangman
,
when
it
comes
home
to
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
what
it
is
,
"
cried
Dennis
,
actually
writhing
as
he
spoke
:
"
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
should
come
to
be
worked
off
!
 
<EOS>
I
!
 
<EOS>
I
!
 
<EOS>
That
I
should
come
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
not
?
"
said
Hugh
,
as
he
thrust
back
his
matted
hair
to
get
a
better
view
of
his
late
associate
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
often
,
before
I
knew
your
trade
,
did
I
hear
you
talking
of
this
as
if
it
was
a
treat
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
an't
unconsistent
,
"
screamed
the
miserable
creature
;
"
I
'd
talk
so
again
,
if
I
was
hangman
.
 
<EOS>
Some
other
man
has
got
my
old
opinions
at
this
minute
.
 
<EOS>
That
makes
it
worse
.
 
<EOS>
Somebody
's
longing
to
work
me
off
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
by
myself
that
somebody
must
be
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
'll
soon
have
his
longing
,
"
said
Hugh
,
resuming
his
walk
.
<EOS>
"
Think
of
that
,
and
be
quiet
.
"
  
<EOS>
Although
one
of
these
men
displayed
,
in
his
speech
and
bearing
,
the
most
reckless
hardihood
;
and
the
other
,
in
his
every
word
and
action
,
testified
such
an
extreme
of
abject
cowardice
that
it
was
humiliating
to
see
him
;
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
which
of
them
would
most
have
repelled
and
shocked
an
observer
.
 
<EOS>
Hugh
's
was
the
dogged
desperation
of
a
savage
at
the
stake
;
the
hangman
was
reduced
to
a
condition
little
better
,
if
any
,
than
that
of
a
hound
with
the
halter
round
his
neck
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
,
as
Mr
Dennis
knew
and
could
have
told
them
,
these
were
the
two
commonest
states
of
mind
in
persons
brought
to
their
pass
.
 
<EOS>
Such
was
the
wholesome
growth
of
the
seed
sown
by
the
law
,
that
this
kind
of
harvest
was
usually
looked
for
,
as
a
matter
of
course
.
  
<EOS>
In
one
respect
they
all
agreed
.
 
<EOS>
The
wandering
and
uncontrollable
train
of
thought
,
suggesting
sudden
recollections
of
things
distant
and
long
forgotten
and
remote
from
each
other
---
the
vague
restless
craving
for
something
undefined
,
which
nothing
could
satisfy
---
the
swift
flight
of
the
minutes
,
fusing
themselves
into
hours
,
as
if
by
enchantment
---
the
rapid
coming
of
the
solemn
night
---
the
shadow
of
death
always
upon
them
,
and
yet
so
dim
and
faint
,
that
objects
the
meanest
and
most
trivial
started
from
the
gloom
beyond
,
and
forced
themselves
upon
the
view
---
the
impossibility
of
holding
the
mind
,
even
if
they
had
been
so
disposed
,
to
penitence
and
preparation
,
or
of
keeping
it
to
any
point
while
one
hideous
fascination
tempted
it
away
---
these
things
were
common
to
them
all
,
and
varied
only
in
their
outward
tokens
.
  
<EOS>
"
Fetch
me
the
book
I
left
within
---
upon
your
bed
,
"
she
said
to
Barnaby
,
as
the
clock
struck
.
 
<EOS>
"
Kiss
me
first
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
in
her
face
,
and
saw
there
,
that
the
time
was
come
.
<EOS>
After
a
long
embrace
,
he
tore
himself
away
,
and
ran
to
bring
it
to
her
;
bidding
her
not
stir
till
he
came
back
.
 
<EOS>
He
soon
returned
,
for
a
shriek
recalled
him
,
---
but
she
was
gone
.
  
<EOS>
He
ran
to
the
yard
-
gate
,
and
looked
through
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
carrying
her
away
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
said
her
heart
would
break
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
better
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
think
,
"
whimpered
Dennis
,
creeping
up
to
him
,
as
he
stood
with
his
feet
rooted
to
the
ground
,
gazing
at
the
blank
walls
<EOS>
---
"
do
n't
you
think
there
's
still
a
chance
?
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
dreadful
end
;
it
's
a
terrible
end
for
a
man
like
me
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
there
's
a
chance
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mean
for
you
,
I
mean
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
HIM
hear
us
(
meaning
Hugh
)
;
"
he
's
so
desperate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Now
then
,
"
said
the
officer
,
who
had
been
lounging
in
and
out
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
and
yawning
as
if
he
were
in
the
last
extremity
for
some
subject
of
interest
:
"
it
's
time
to
turn
in
,
boys
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
yet
,
"
cried
Dennis
,
"
not
yet
.
 
<EOS>
Not
for
an
hour
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
---
your
watch
goes
different
from
what
it
used
to
,
"
returned
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Once
upon
a
time
it
was
always
too
fast
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
got
the
other
fault
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
friend
,
"
cried
the
wretched
creature
,
falling
on
his
knees
,
"
my
dear
friend
<EOS>
---
you
always
were
my
dear
friend
---
there
's
some
mistake
.
<EOS>
Some
letter
has
been
mislaid
,
or
some
messenger
has
been
stopped
upon
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
have
fallen
dead
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
a
man
once
,
fall
down
dead
in
the
street
,
myself
,
and
he
had
papers
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
Send
to
inquire
.
 
<EOS>
Let
somebody
go
to
inquire
.
 
<EOS>
They
never
will
hang
me
.
 
<EOS>
They
never
can
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Yes
,
they
will
,
"
he
cried
,
starting
to
his
feet
with
a
terrible
scream
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
'll
hang
me
by
a
trick
,
and
keep
the
pardon
back
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
plot
against
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
lose
my
life
!
"
<EOS>
And
uttering
another
yell
,
he
fell
in
a
fit
upon
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
"
See
the
hangman
when
it
comes
home
to
him
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Hugh
again
,
as
they
bore
him
away
---
"
<EOS>
Ha
ha
ha
!
 
<EOS>
Courage
,
bold
Barnaby
,
what
care
we
?
 
<EOS>
Your
hand
!
 
<EOS>
They
do
well
to
put
us
out
of
the
world
,
for
if
we
got
loose
a
second
time
,
we
would
n't
let
them
off
<EOS>
so
easy
,
eh
?
<EOS>
Another
shake
!
 
<EOS>
A
man
can
die
but
once
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
wake
in
the
night
,
sing
that
out
lustily
,
and
fall
asleep
again
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
ha
ha
!
<EOS>
"
  
Barnaby
glanced
once
more
through
the
grate
into
the
empty
yard
;
and
then
watched
Hugh
as
he
strode
to
the
steps
leading
to
his
sleeping
-
cell
.
 
<EOS>
He
heard
him
shout
,
and
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
,
and
saw
him
flourish
his
hat
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
turned
away
himself
,
like
one
who
walked
in
his
sleep
;
and
,
without
any
sense
of
fear
or
sorrow
,
lay
down
on
his
pallet
,
listening
for
the
clock
to
strike
again
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
77
    
<EOS>
The
time
wore
on
.
 
<EOS>
The
noises
in
the
streets
became
less
frequent
by
degrees
,
until
silence
was
scarcely
broken
save
by
the
bells
in
church
towers
,
marking
the
progress
---
softer
and
more
stealthy
while
the
city
slumbered
---
of
that
Great
Watcher
with
the
hoary
head
,
who
never
sleeps
or
rests
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
brief
interval
of
darkness
and
repose
which
feverish
towns
enjoy
,
all
busy
sounds
were
hushed
;
and
those
who
awoke
from
dreams
lay
listening
in
their
beds
,
and
longed
for
dawn
,
and
wished
the
dead
of
the
night
were
past
.
  
<EOS>
Into
the
street
outside
the
jail
's
main
wall
,
workmen
came
straggling
at
this
solemn
hour
,
in
groups
of
two
or
three
,
and
meeting
in
the
centre
,
cast
their
tools
upon
the
ground
and
spoke
in
whispers
.
 
<EOS>
Others
soon
issued
from
the
jail
itself
,
bearing
on
their
shoulders
planks
and
beams
:
these
materials
being
all
brought
forth
,
the
rest
bestirred
themselves
,
and
the
dull
sound
of
hammers
began
to
echo
through
the
stillness
.
  
<EOS>
Here
and
there
among
this
knot
of
labourers
,
one
,
with
a
lantern
or
a
smoky
link
,
stood
by
to
light
his
fellows
at
their
work
;
and
by
its
doubtful
aid
,
some
might
be
dimly
seen
taking
up
the
pavement
of
the
road
,
while
others
held
great
upright
posts
,
or
fixed
them
in
the
holes
thus
made
for
their
reception
.
 
<EOS>
Some
dragged
slowly
on
,
towards
the
rest
,
an
empty
cart
,
which
they
brought
rumbling
from
the
prison
-
yard
;
while
others
erected
strong
barriers
across
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
All
were
busily
engaged
.
 
<EOS>
Their
dusky
figures
moving
to
and
fro
,
at
that
unusual
hour
,
so
active
and
so
silent
,
might
have
been
taken
for
those
of
shadowy
creatures
toiling
at
midnight
on
some
ghostly
unsubstantial
work
,
which
,
like
themselves
,
would
vanish
with
the
first
gleam
of
day
,
and
leave
but
morning
mist
and
vapour
.
  
<EOS>
While
it
was
yet
dark
,
a
few
lookers
-
on
collected
,
who
had
plainly
come
there
for
the
purpose
and
intended
to
remain
:
even
those
who
had
to
pass
the
spot
on
their
way
to
some
other
place
,
lingered
,
and
lingered
yet
,
as
though
the
attraction
of
that
were
irresistible
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
the
noise
of
saw
and
mallet
went
on
briskly
,
mingled
with
the
clattering
of
boards
on
the
stone
pavement
of
the
road
,
and
sometimes
with
the
workmen
's
voices
as
they
called
to
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
Whenever
the
chimes
of
the
neighbouring
church
were
heard
---
and
that
was
every
quarter
of
an
hour
---
a
strange
sensation
,
instantaneous
and
indescribable
,
but
perfectly
obvious
,
<EOS>
seemed
to
pervade
them
all
.
  
<EOS>
Gradually
,
a
faint
brightness
appeared
in
the
east
,
and
the
air
,
which
had
been
very
warm
all
through
the
night
,
felt
cool
and
chilly
.
 
<EOS>
Though
there
was
no
daylight
yet
,
the
darkness
was
diminished
,
and
the
stars
looked
pale
.
 
<EOS>
The
prison
,
which
had
been
a
mere
black
mass
with
little
shape
or
form
,
put
on
its
usual
aspect
;
and
ever
and
anon
a
solitary
watchman
could
be
seen
upon
its
roof
,
stopping
to
look
down
upon
the
preparations
in
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
This
man
,
from
forming
,
as
it
were
,
a
part
of
the
jail
,
and
knowing
or
being
supposed
to
know
all
that
was
passing
within
,
became
an
object
of
as
much
interest
,
and
was
as
eagerly
looked
for
,
and
as
awfully
pointed
out
,
as
if
he
had
been
a
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
By
and
by
,
the
feeble
light
grew
stronger
,
and
the
houses
with
their
signboards
and
inscriptions
,
stood
plainly
out
,
in
the
dull
grey
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Heavy
stage
waggons
crawled
from
the
inn
-
yard
opposite
;
and
travellers
peeped
out
;
and
as
they
rolled
sluggishly
away
,
cast
many
a
backward
look
towards
the
jail
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
,
the
sun
's
first
beams
came
glancing
into
the
street
;
and
the
night
's
work
,
which
,
in
its
various
stages
and
in
the
varied
fancies
of
the
lookers
-
on
had
taken
a
hundred
shapes
,
wore
its
own
proper
form
---
a
scaffold
,
and
a
gibbet
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
warmth
of
the
cheerful
day
began
to
shed
itself
upon
the
scanty
crowd
,
the
murmur
of
tongues
was
heard
,
shutters
were
thrown
open
,
and
blinds
drawn
up
,
and
those
who
had
slept
in
rooms
over
against
the
prison
,
where
places
to
see
the
execution
were
let
at
high
prices
,
rose
hastily
from
their
beds
.
 
<EOS>
In
some
of
the
houses
,
people
were
busy
taking
out
the
window
-
sashes
for
the
better
accommodation
of
spectators
;
in
others
,
the
spectators
were
already
seated
,
and
beguiling
the
time
with
cards
,
or
drink
,
or
jokes
among
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
Some
had
purchased
seats
upon
the
house
-
tops
,
and
were
already
crawling
to
their
stations
from
parapet
and
garret
-
window
.
 
<EOS>
Some
were
yet
bargaining
for
good
places
,
and
stood
in
them
in
a
state
of
indecision
:
gazing
at
the
slowly
-
swelling
crowd
,
and
at
the
workmen
as
they
rested
listlessly
against
the
scaffold
---
 
affecting
to
listen
with
indifference
to
the
proprietor
's
eulogy
of
the
commanding
view
his
house
afforded
,
and
the
surpassing
cheapness
of
his
terms
.
  
<EOS>
A
fairer
morning
never
shone
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
roofs
and
upper
stories
of
these
buildings
,
the
spires
of
city
churches
and
the
great
cathedral
dome
were
visible
,
rising
up
beyond
the
prison
,
into
the
blue
sky
,
and
clad
in
the
colour
of
light
summer
clouds
,
and
showing
in
the
clear
atmosphere
their
every
scrap
of
tracery
and
fretwork
,
and
every
niche
and
loophole
.
 
<EOS>
All
was
brightness
and
promise
,
excepting
in
the
street
below
,
into
which
(
for
it
yet
lay
in
shadow
)
<EOS>
the
eye
looked
down
as
into
a
dark
trench
,
where
,
in
the
midst
of
so
much
life
,
and
hope
,
and
renewal
of
existence
,
stood
the
terrible
instrument
of
death
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
if
the
very
sun
forbore
to
look
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
But
it
was
better
,
grim
and
sombre
in
the
shade
,
than
when
,
the
day
being
more
advanced
,
it
stood
confessed
in
the
full
glare
and
glory
of
the
sun
,
with
its
black
paint
blistering
,
and
its
nooses
dangling
in
the
light
like
loathsome
garlands
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
better
in
the
solitude
and
gloom
of
midnight
with
a
few
forms
clustering
about
it
,
than
in
the
freshness
and
the
stir
of
morning
:
<EOS>
the
centre
of
an
eager
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
better
haunting
the
street
like
a
spectre
,
when
men
were
in
their
beds
,
and
influencing
perchance
the
city
's
dreams
,
than
braving
the
broad
day
,
and
thrusting
its
obscene
presence
upon
their
waking
senses
.
  
<EOS>
Five
o'clock
had
struck
---
six
---
seven
---
and
eight
.
 
<EOS>
Along
the
two
main
streets
at
either
end
of
the
cross
-
way
,
a
living
stream
had
now
set
in
,
rolling
towards
the
marts
of
gain
and
business
.
 
<EOS>
Carts
,
coaches
,
waggons
,
trucks
,
and
barrows
,
forced
a
passage
through
the
outskirts
of
the
throng
,
and
clattered
onward
in
the
same
direction
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
these
which
were
public
conveyances
and
had
come
from
a
short
distance
in
the
country
,
stopped
;
and
the
driver
pointed
to
the
gibbet
with
his
whip
,
though
he
might
have
spared
himself
the
pains
,
for
the
heads
of
all
the
passengers
were
turned
that
way
without
his
help
,
and
the
coach
-
windows
were
stuck
full
of
staring
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
In
some
of
the
carts
and
waggons
,
women
might
be
seen
,
glancing
fearfully
at
the
same
unsightly
thing
;
and
even
little
children
were
held
up
above
the
people
's
heads
to
see
what
kind
of
a
toy
a
gallows
was
,
and
learn
how
men
were
hanged
.
  
<EOS>
Two
rioters
were
to
die
before
the
prison
,
who
had
been
concerned
in
the
attack
upon
it
;
and
one
directly
afterwards
in
Bloomsbury
Square
.
 
<EOS>
At
nine
o'clock
,
a
strong
body
of
military
marched
into
the
street
,
and
formed
and
lined
a
narrow
passage
into
Holborn
,
which
had
been
indifferently
kept
all
night
by
constables
.
 
<EOS>
Through
this
,
another
cart
was
brought
(
the
one
already
mentioned
had
been
employed
in
the
construction
of
the
scaffold
)
,
and
wheeled
up
to
the
prison
-
gate
.
 
<EOS>
These
preparations
made
,
the
soldiers
stood
at
ease
;
the
officers
lounged
to
and
fro
,
in
the
alley
they
had
made
,
or
talked
together
at
the
scaffold
's
foot
;
and
the
concourse
,
which
had
been
rapidly
augmenting
for
some
hours
,
and
still
received
additions
every
minute
,
waited
with
an
impatience
which
increased
with
every
chime
of
St
Sepulchre
's
clock
,
for
twelve
at
noon
.
  
<EOS>
Up
to
this
time
they
had
been
very
quiet
,
comparatively
silent
,
save
when
the
arrival
of
some
new
party
at
a
window
,
hitherto
unoccupied
,
gave
them
something
new
to
look
at
or
to
talk
of
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
as
the
hour
approached
,
a
buzz
and
hum
arose
,
which
,
deepening
every
moment
,
soon
swelled
into
a
roar
,
and
seemed
to
fill
the
air
.
<EOS>
No
words
or
even
voices
could
be
distinguished
in
this
clamour
,
nor
did
they
speak
much
to
each
other
;
though
such
as
were
better
informed
upon
the
topic
than
the
rest
,
would
tell
their
neighbours
,
perhaps
,
that
they
might
know
the
hangman
when
he
came
out
,
by
his
being
the
shorter
one
:
and
that
the
man
who
was
to
suffer
with
him
was
named
Hugh
:
and
that
it
was
Barnaby
Rudge
who
would
be
hanged
in
Bloomsbury
Square
.
  
<EOS>
The
hum
grew
,
as
the
time
drew
near
,
so
loud
,
that
those
who
were
at
the
windows
could
not
hear
the
church
-
clock
strike
,
though
it
was
close
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
had
they
any
need
to
hear
it
,
either
,
for
they
could
see
it
in
the
people
's
faces
.
 
<EOS>
So
surely
as
another
quarter
chimed
,
there
was
a
movement
in
the
crowd
---
as
if
something
had
passed
over
it
---
as
if
the
light
upon
them
had
been
changed
---
in
which
the
fact
was
readable
as
on
a
brazen
dial
,
figured
by
a
giant
's
hand
.
  
<EOS>
Three
quarters
past
eleven
!
 
<EOS>
The
murmur
now
was
deafening
,
yet
every
man
seemed
mute
.
 
<EOS>
Look
where
you
would
among
the
crowd
,
you
saw
strained
eyes
and
lips
compressed
;
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
the
most
vigilant
observer
to
point
this
way
or
that
,
and
say
that
yonder
man
had
cried
out
.
 
<EOS>
It
were
as
easy
to
detect
the
motion
of
lips
in
a
sea
-
shell
.
  
<EOS>
Three
quarters
past
eleven
!
 
<EOS>
Many
spectators
who
had
retired
from
the
windows
,
came
back
refreshed
,
as
though
their
watch
had
just
begun
.
 
<EOS>
Those
who
had
fallen
asleep
,
roused
themselves
;
and
every
person
in
the
crowd
made
one
last
effort
to
better
his
position
---
 
which
caused
a
press
against
the
sturdy
barriers
that
made
them
bend
and
yield
like
twigs
.
 
<EOS>
The
officers
,
who
until
now
had
kept
together
,
fell
into
their
several
positions
,
and
gave
the
words
of
command
.
 
<EOS>
Swords
were
drawn
,
muskets
shouldered
,
and
the
bright
steel
winding
its
way
among
the
crowd
,
gleamed
and
glittered
in
the
sun
like
a
river
.
 
<EOS>
Along
this
shining
path
,
two
men
came
hurrying
on
,
leading
a
horse
,
which
was
speedily
harnessed
to
the
cart
at
the
prison
-
door
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
a
profound
silence
replaced
the
tumult
that
had
so
long
been
gathering
,
and
a
breathless
pause
ensued
.
 
<EOS>
Every
window
was
now
choked
up
with
heads
;
the
house
-
tops
teemed
with
people
---
clinging
to
chimneys
,
peering
over
gable
-
ends
,
and
holding
on
where
the
sudden
loosening
of
any
brick
or
stone
would
dash
them
down
into
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
The
church
tower
,
the
church
roof
,
the
church
yard
,
the
prison
leads
,
the
very
water
-
spouts
and
lampposts
---
every
inch
of
room
---
swarmed
with
human
life
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
first
stroke
of
twelve
the
prison
-
bell
began
to
toll
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
roar
---
mingled
now
with
cries
of
"
Hats
off
!
"
and
"
Poor
fellows
!
"
<EOS>
and
,
from
some
specks
in
the
great
concourse
,
with
a
shriek
or
groan
---
burst
forth
again
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
terrible
to
see
---
if
any
one
in
that
distraction
of
excitement
could
have
seen
---
the
world
of
eager
eyes
,
all
strained
upon
the
scaffold
and
the
beam
.
  
<EOS>
The
hollow
murmuring
was
heard
within
the
jail
as
plainly
as
without
.
 
<EOS>
The
three
were
brought
forth
into
the
yard
,
together
,
as
it
resounded
through
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
They
knew
its
import
well
.
  
<EOS>
"
D'ye
hear
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Hugh
,
undaunted
by
the
sound
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
expect
us
!
<EOS>
I
heard
them
gathering
when
I
woke
in
the
night
,
and
turned
over
on
t'other
side
and
fell
asleep
again
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
see
how
they
welcome
the
hangman
,
now
that
it
comes
home
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
Ordinary
coming
up
at
this
moment
,
reproved
him
for
his
indecent
mirth
,
and
advised
him
to
alter
his
demeanour
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
why
,
master
?
"
said
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Can
I
do
better
than
bear
it
easily
?
 
<EOS>
YOU
bear
it
easily
enough
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
never
tell
me
,
"
he
cried
,
as
the
other
would
have
spoken
,
"
for
all
your
sad
look
and
your
solemn
air
,
you
think
little
enough
of
it
!
 
<EOS>
They
say
you
're
the
best
maker
of
lobster
salads
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
I
've
heard
that
,
you
see
,
before
now
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
a
good
one
<EOS>
,
this
morning
---
is
your
hand
in
?
 
<EOS>
How
does
the
breakfast
look
?
 
<EOS>
I
hope
there
's
enough
,
and
to
spare
,
for
all
this
hungry
company
that
'll
sit
down
to
it
,
when
the
sight
's
over
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
fear
,
"
observed
the
clergyman
,
shaking
his
head
,
"
that
you
are
incorrigible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
right
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
,
"
rejoined
Hugh
sternly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
no
hypocrite
,
master
!
 
<EOS>
You
make
a
merry
-
making
of
this
,
every
month
;
let
me
be
merry
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
want
a
frightened
fellow
there
's
one
that
'll
suit
you
.
 
<EOS>
Try
your
hand
upon
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
pointed
,
as
he
spoke
,
to
Dennis
,
who
,
with
his
legs
trailing
on
the
ground
,
was
held
between
two
men
;
and
who
trembled
so
,
that
all
his
joints
and
limbs
seemed
racked
by
spasms
.
 
<EOS>
Turning
from
this
wretched
spectacle
,
he
called
to
Barnaby
,
who
stood
apart
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
cheer
,
Barnaby
?
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
downcast
,
lad
.
 
<EOS>
Leave
that
to
HIM
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Bless
you
,
"
cried
Barnaby
,
stepping
lightly
towards
him
,
"
I
'm
not
frightened
,
Hugh
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
quite
happy
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
desire
to
live
now
,
if
they
'd
let
me
.
 
<EOS>
Look
at
me
!
 
<EOS>
Am
I
afraid
to
die
?
 
<EOS>
Will
they
see
ME
tremble
?
"
  
<EOS>
Hugh
gazed
for
a
moment
at
his
face
,
on
which
there
was
a
strange
,
unearthly
smile
;
and
at
his
eye
,
which
sparkled
brightly
;
and
interposing
between
him
and
the
Ordinary
,
gruffly
whispered
to
the
latter
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
n't
say
much
to
him
,
master
,
if
I
was
you
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
spoil
your
appetite
for
breakfast
,
though
you
ARE
used
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
the
only
one
of
the
three
who
had
washed
or
trimmed
himself
that
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
of
the
others
had
done
so
,
since
their
doom
was
pronounced
.
 
<EOS>
He
still
wore
the
broken
peacock
's
feathers
in
his
hat
;
and
all
his
usual
scraps
of
finery
were
carefully
disposed
about
his
person
.
 
<EOS>
His
kindling
eye
,
his
firm
step
,
his
proud
and
resolute
bearing
,
might
have
graced
some
lofty
act
of
heroism
;
some
voluntary
sacrifice
,
born
of
a
noble
cause
and
pure
enthusiasm
;
rather
than
that
felon
's
death
.
  
<EOS>
But
all
these
things
increased
his
guilt
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
mere
assumptions
.
 
<EOS>
The
law
had
declared
it
so
,
and
so
it
must
be
.
 
<EOS>
The
good
minister
had
been
greatly
shocked
,
not
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
,
at
his
parting
with
Grip
.
 
<EOS>
For
one
in
his
condition
,
to
fondle
a
bird
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
The
yard
was
filled
with
people
;
bluff
civic
functionaries
,
officers
of
justice
,
soldiers
,
the
curious
in
such
matters
,
and
guests
who
had
been
bidden
as
to
a
wedding
.
 
<EOS>
Hugh
looked
about
him
,
nodded
gloomily
to
some
person
in
authority
,
who
indicated
with
his
hand
in
what
direction
he
was
to
proceed
;
and
clapping
Barnaby
on
the
shoulder
,
passed
out
with
the
gait
of
a
lion
.
  
<EOS>
They
entered
a
large
room
,
so
near
to
the
scaffold
that
the
voices
of
those
who
stood
about
it
,
could
be
plainly
heard
:
some
beseeching
the
javelin
-
men
to
take
them
out
of
the
crowd
:
others
crying
to
those
behind
,
to
stand
back
,
for
they
were
pressed
to
death
,
and
suffocating
for
want
of
air
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
middle
of
this
chamber
,
two
smiths
,
with
hammers
,
stood
beside
an
anvil
.
 
<EOS>
Hugh
walked
straight
up
to
them
,
and
set
his
foot
upon
it
with
a
sound
as
though
it
had
been
struck
by
a
heavy
weapon
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
with
folded
arms
,
he
stood
to
have
his
irons
knocked
off
:
<EOS>
scowling
haughtily
round
,
as
those
who
were
present
eyed
him
narrowly
and
whispered
to
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
It
took
so
much
time
to
drag
Dennis
in
,
that
this
ceremony
was
over
with
Hugh
,
and
nearly
over
with
Barnaby
,
before
he
appeared
.
 
<EOS>
He
no
sooner
came
into
the
place
he
knew
so
well
,
however
,
and
among
faces
with
which
he
was
so
familiar
,
than
he
recovered
strength
and
sense
enough
to
clasp
his
hands
and
make
a
last
appeal
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
good
gentlemen
,
"
cried
the
abject
creature
,
grovelling
down
upon
his
knees
,
and
actually
prostrating
himself
upon
the
stone
floor
:
"
Governor
,
dear
governor
---
honourable
sheriffs
---
worthy
gentlemen
---
have
mercy
upon
a
wretched
man
that
has
served
His
Majesty
,
and
the
Law
,
and
Parliament
,
for
so
many
years
,
and
do
n't
---
 
<EOS>
do
n't
let
me
die
---
because
of
a
mistake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dennis
,
"
said
the
governor
of
the
jail
,
"
you
know
what
the
course
is
,
and
that
the
order
came
with
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
that
we
could
do
nothing
,
even
if
we
would
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
I
ask
,
sir
,
---
all
I
want
and
beg
,
is
time
,
to
make
it
sure
,
"
cried
the
trembling
wretch
,
looking
wildly
round
for
sympathy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
King
and
Government
ca
n't
know
it
's
me
;
I
'm
sure
they
ca
n't
know
it
's
me
;
or
they
never
would
bring
me
to
this
dreadful
slaughterhouse
.
 
<EOS>
They
know
my
name
,
but
they
do
n't
know
it
's
the
same
man
.
 
<EOS>
Stop
my
execution
---
for
charity
's
sake
stop
my
execution
,
gentlemen
---
till
they
can
be
told
that
I
've
been
hangman
here
,
nigh
thirty
year
.
 
<EOS>
Will
no
one
go
and
tell
them
?
"
<EOS>
he
implored
,
clenching
his
hands
and
glaring
round
,
and
round
,
and
round
again
---
"
will
no
charitable
person
go
and
tell
them
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Akerman
,
"
said
a
gentleman
who
stood
by
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
"
since
it
may
possibly
produce
in
this
unhappy
man
a
better
frame
of
mind
,
even
at
this
last
minute
,
let
me
assure
him
that
he
was
well
known
to
have
been
the
hangman
,
when
his
sentence
was
considered
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
---
But
perhaps
they
think
on
that
account
that
the
punishment
's
not
so
great
,
"
cried
the
criminal
,
shuffling
towards
this
speaker
on
his
knees
,
and
holding
up
his
folded
hands
;
"
whereas
it
's
worse
,
it
's
worse
a
hundred
times
,
to
me
than
any
man
.
 
<EOS>
Let
them
know
that
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Let
them
know
that
.
 
<EOS>
They
've
made
it
worse
to
me
by
giving
me
so
much
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
Stop
my
execution
till
they
know
that
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
governor
beckoned
with
his
hand
,
and
the
two
men
,
who
had
supported
him
before
,
approached
.
 
<EOS>
He
uttered
a
piercing
cry
:
  
"
<EOS>
Wait
!
 
<EOS>
Wait
.
 
<EOS>
Only
a
moment
---
only
one
moment
more
!
 
<EOS>
Give
me
a
last
chance
of
reprieve
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
us
three
is
to
go
to
Bloomsbury
Square
.
<EOS>
Let
me
be
the
one
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
come
in
that
time
;
it
's
sure
to
come
.
<EOS>
In
the
Lord
's
name
let
me
be
sent
to
Bloomsbury
Square
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
hang
me
here
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
murder
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
took
him
to
the
anvil
:
but
even
then
he
could
he
heard
above
the
clinking
of
the
smiths
'
hammers
,
and
the
hoarse
raging
of
the
crowd
,
crying
that
he
knew
of
Hugh
's
birth
---
that
his
father
was
living
,
and
was
a
gentleman
of
influence
and
rank
---
that
he
had
family
secrets
in
his
possession
---
that
he
could
tell
nothing
unless
they
gave
him
time
,
but
must
die
with
them
on
his
mind
;
and
he
continued
to
rave
in
this
sort
until
his
voice
failed
him
,
and
he
sank
down
a
mere
heap
of
clothes
between
the
two
attendants
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
at
this
moment
that
the
clock
struck
the
first
stroke
of
twelve
,
and
the
bell
began
to
toll
.
 
<EOS>
The
various
officers
,
with
the
two
sheriffs
at
their
head
,
moved
towards
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
All
was
ready
when
the
last
chime
came
upon
the
ear
.
  
<EOS>
They
told
Hugh
this
,
and
asked
if
he
had
anything
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
say
!
<EOS>
"
he
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
I.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
ready
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Yes
,
"
he
added
,
as
his
eye
fell
upon
Barnaby
,
"
I
have
a
word
to
say
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
Come
hither
,
lad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
,
for
the
moment
,
something
kind
,
and
even
tender
,
struggling
in
his
fierce
aspect
,
as
he
wrung
his
poor
companion
by
the
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
say
this
,
"
he
cried
,
looking
firmly
round
,
"
that
if
I
had
ten
lives
to
lose
,
and
the
loss
of
each
would
give
me
ten
times
the
agony
of
the
hardest
death
,
I
'd
lay
them
all
down
---
<EOS>
ay
,
I
would
,
though
you
gentlemen
may
not
believe
it
---
to
save
this
one
.
 
<EOS>
This
one
,
"
he
added
,
wringing
his
hand
again
,
"
that
will
be
lost
through
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
through
you
,
"
said
the
idiot
,
mildly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
say
that
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
not
to
blame
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
always
been
very
good
to
me
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Hugh
,
we
shall
know
what
makes
the
stars
shine
,
NOW
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
took
him
from
her
in
a
reckless
mood
,
and
did
n't
think
what
harm
would
come
of
it
,
"
said
Hugh
,
laying
his
hand
upon
his
head
,
and
speaking
in
a
lower
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ask
her
pardon
;
and
his
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Look
here
,
"
he
added
roughly
,
in
his
former
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
this
lad
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
murmured
"
Yes
,
"
and
seemed
to
wonder
why
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
gentleman
yonder
---
"
pointing
to
the
clergyman
---
"
has
often
in
the
last
few
days
spoken
to
me
of
faith
,
and
strong
belief
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
what
I
am
---
more
brute
than
man
,
as
I
have
been
often
told
---
<EOS>
but
I
had
faith
enough
to
believe
,
and
did
believe
as
strongly
as
any
of
you
gentlemen
can
believe
anything
,
that
this
one
life
would
be
spared
.
 
<EOS>
See
what
he
is
!
<EOS>
---
Look
at
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
Barnaby
had
moved
towards
the
door
,
and
stood
beckoning
him
to
follow
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
this
was
not
faith
,
and
strong
belief
!
"
cried
Hugh
,
raising
his
right
arm
aloft
,
and
looking
upward
like
a
savage
prophet
whom
the
near
approach
of
Death
had
filled
with
inspiration
,
<EOS>
"
where
are
they
!
 
<EOS>
What
else
should
teach
me
---
me
,
born
as
I
was
born
,
and
reared
as
I
have
been
reared
---
to
hope
for
any
mercy
in
this
hardened
,
cruel
,
unrelenting
place
!
 
<EOS>
Upon
these
human
shambles
,
I
,
who
never
raised
this
hand
in
prayer
till
now
,
call
down
the
wrath
of
God
!
 
<EOS>
On
that
black
tree
,
of
which
I
am
the
ripened
fruit
,
I
do
invoke
the
curse
of
all
its
victims
,
past
,
and
present
,
and
to
come
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
head
of
that
man
,
who
,
in
his
conscience
,
owns
me
for
his
son
,
I
leave
the
wish
that
he
may
never
sicken
on
his
bed
of
down
,
but
die
a
violent
death
as
I
do
now
,
and
have
the
night
-
wind
for
his
only
mourner
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
I
say
,
Amen
,
amen
!
"
  
<EOS>
His
arm
fell
downward
by
his
side
;
he
turned
;
and
moved
towards
them
with
a
steady
step
,
the
man
he
had
been
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
more
?
"
said
the
governor
.
  
<EOS>
Hugh
motioned
Barnaby
not
to
come
near
him
(
though
without
looking
in
the
direction
where
he
stood
)
and
answered
,
"
There
is
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Move
forward
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
---
Unless
,
"
said
Hugh
,
glancing
hurriedly
back
,
---
"
unless
any
person
here
has
a
fancy
for
a
dog
;
and
not
then
,
unless
he
means
to
use
him
well
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
one
,
belongs
to
me
,
at
the
house
I
came
from
,
and
it
would
n't
be
easy
to
find
a
better
.
 
<EOS>
He
'll
whine
at
first
,
but
he
'll
soon
get
over
that
.
<EOS>
---
You
wonder
that
I
think
about
a
dog
just
now
,
he
added
,
with
a
kind
of
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
any
man
deserved
it
of
me
half
as
well
,
I
'd
think
of
HIM
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
spoke
no
more
,
but
moved
onward
in
his
place
,
with
a
careless
air
,
though
listening
at
the
same
time
to
the
Service
for
the
Dead
,
with
something
between
sullen
attention
,
and
quickened
curiosity
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
had
passed
the
door
,
his
miserable
associate
was
carried
out
;
and
the
crowd
beheld
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
Barnaby
would
have
mounted
the
steps
at
the
same
time
---
indeed
he
would
have
gone
before
them
,
but
in
both
attempts
he
was
restrained
,
as
he
was
to
undergo
the
sentence
elsewhere
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
the
sheriffs
reappeared
,
the
same
procession
was
again
formed
,
and
they
passed
through
various
rooms
and
passages
to
another
door
---
that
at
which
the
cart
was
waiting
.
 
<EOS>
He
held
down
his
head
to
avoid
seeing
what
he
knew
his
eyes
must
otherwise
encounter
,
and
took
his
seat
sorrowfully
,
---
and
yet
with
something
of
a
childish
pride
and
pleasure
,
---
in
the
vehicle
.
 
<EOS>
The
officers
fell
into
their
places
at
the
sides
,
in
front
and
in
the
rear
;
the
sheriffs
'
carriages
rolled
on
;
a
guard
of
soldiers
surrounded
the
whole
;
and
they
moved
slowly
forward
through
the
throng
and
pressure
toward
Lord
Mansfield
's
ruined
house
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
sad
sight
---
all
the
show
,
and
strength
,
and
glitter
,
assembled
round
one
helpless
creature
---
and
sadder
yet
to
note
,
as
he
rode
along
,
how
his
wandering
thoughts
found
strange
encouragement
in
the
crowded
windows
and
the
concourse
in
the
streets
;
and
how
,
even
then
,
he
felt
the
influence
of
the
bright
sky
,
and
looked
up
,
smiling
,
into
its
deep
unfathomable
blue
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
had
been
many
such
sights
since
the
riots
were
over
---
<EOS>
some
so
moving
in
their
nature
,
and
so
repulsive
too
,
that
they
were
far
more
calculated
to
awaken
pity
for
the
sufferers
,
than
respect
for
that
law
whose
strong
arm
seemed
in
more
than
one
case
to
be
as
wantonly
stretched
forth
now
that
all
was
safe
,
as
it
had
been
basely
paralysed
in
time
of
danger
.
  
<EOS>
Two
cripples
---
both
mere
boys
---
one
with
a
leg
of
wood
,
one
who
dragged
his
twisted
limbs
along
by
the
help
of
a
crutch
,
were
hanged
in
this
same
Bloomsbury
Square
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
cart
was
about
to
glide
from
under
them
,
it
was
observed
that
they
stood
with
their
faces
from
,
not
to
,
the
house
they
had
assisted
to
despoil
;
and
<EOS>
their
misery
was
protracted
that
this
omission
might
be
remedied
.
<EOS>
Another
boy
was
hanged
in
Bow
Street
;
other
young
lads
in
various
quarters
of
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
Four
wretched
women
,
too
,
were
put
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
those
who
suffered
as
rioters
were
,
for
the
most
part
,
the
weakest
,
meanest
,
and
most
miserable
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
most
exquisite
satire
upon
the
false
religious
cry
which
had
led
to
so
much
misery
,
that
some
of
these
people
owned
themselves
to
be
Catholics
,
and
begged
to
be
attended
by
their
own
priests
.
  
<EOS>
One
young
man
was
hanged
in
Bishopsgate
Street
,
whose
aged
grey
-
headed
father
waited
for
him
at
the
gallows
,
kissed
him
at
its
foot
when
he
arrived
,
and
sat
there
,
on
the
ground
,
till
they
took
him
down
.
 
<EOS>
They
would
have
given
him
the
body
of
his
child
;
but
he
had
no
hearse
,
no
coffin
,
nothing
to
remove
it
in
,
being
too
poor
---
and
walked
meekly
away
beside
the
cart
that
took
it
back
to
prison
,
trying
,
as
he
went
,
to
touch
its
lifeless
hand
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
crowd
had
forgotten
these
matters
,
or
cared
little
about
them
if
they
lived
in
their
memory
:
<EOS>
and
while
one
great
multitude
fought
and
hustled
to
get
near
the
gibbet
before
Newgate
,
for
a
parting
look
,
another
followed
in
the
train
of
poor
lost
Barnaby
,
to
swell
the
throng
that
waited
for
him
on
the
spot
.

Chapter
78
    
<EOS>
On
this
same
day
,
and
about
this
very
hour
,
Mr
Willet
the
elder
sat
smoking
his
pipe
in
a
chamber
at
the
Black
Lion
.
 
<EOS>
Although
it
was
hot
summer
weather
,
Mr
Willet
sat
close
to
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
in
a
state
of
profound
cogitation
,
with
his
own
thoughts
,
and
it
was
his
custom
at
such
times
to
stew
himself
slowly
,
under
the
impression
that
that
process
of
cookery
was
favourable
to
the
melting
out
of
his
ideas
,
which
,
when
he
began
to
simmer
,
sometimes
oozed
forth
so
copiously
as
to
astonish
even
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Willet
had
been
several
thousand
times
comforted
by
his
friends
and
acquaintance
,
with
the
assurance
that
for
the
loss
he
had
sustained
in
the
damage
done
to
the
Maypole
,
he
could
"
come
upon
the
county
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
as
this
phrase
happened
to
bear
an
unfortunate
resemblance
to
the
popular
expression
of
"
coming
on
the
parish
,
"
it
suggested
to
Mr
Willet
's
mind
no
more
consolatory
visions
than
pauperism
on
an
extensive
scale
,
and
ruin
in
a
capacious
aspect
.
<EOS>
Consequently
,
he
had
never
failed
to
receive
the
intelligence
with
a
rueful
shake
of
the
head
,
or
a
dreary
stare
,
and
had
been
always
observed
to
appear
much
more
melancholy
after
a
visit
of
condolence
than
at
any
other
time
in
the
whole
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
.
  
<EOS>
It
chanced
,
however
,
that
sitting
over
the
fire
on
this
particular
occasion
---
perhaps
because
he
was
,
as
it
were
,
done
to
a
turn
;
perhaps
because
he
was
in
an
unusually
bright
state
of
mind
;
perhaps
because
he
had
considered
the
subject
so
long
;
perhaps
because
of
all
these
favouring
circumstances
,
taken
together
---
it
chanced
that
,
sitting
over
the
fire
on
this
particular
occasion
,
Mr
Willet
did
,
afar
off
and
in
the
remotest
depths
of
his
intellect
,
perceive
a
kind
of
lurking
hint
or
faint
suggestion
,
that
out
of
the
public
purse
there
might
issue
funds
for
the
restoration
of
the
Maypole
to
its
former
high
place
among
the
taverns
of
the
earth
.
<EOS>
And
this
dim
ray
of
light
did
so
diffuse
itself
within
him
,
and
did
so
kindle
up
and
shine
,
that
at
last
he
had
it
as
plainly
and
visibly
before
him
as
the
blaze
by
which
he
sat
;
and
,
fully
persuaded
that
he
was
the
first
to
make
the
discovery
,
and
that
he
had
started
,
hunted
down
,
fallen
upon
,
and
knocked
on
the
head
,
a
perfectly
original
idea
which
had
never
presented
itself
to
any
other
man
,
alive
or
dead
,
he
laid
down
his
pipe
,
rubbed
his
hands
,
and
chuckled
audibly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
father
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Joe
,
entering
at
the
moment
<EOS>
,
"
you
're
in
spirits
to
-
day
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
nothing
partickler
,
"
said
Mr
Willet
,
chuckling
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
nothing
at
all
partickler
,
Joseph
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
something
about
the
Salwanners
.
"
 
<EOS>
Having
preferred
this
request
,
Mr
Willet
chuckled
a
third
time
,
and
after
these
unusual
demonstrations
of
levity
,
he
put
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
shall
I
tell
you
,
father
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Joe
,
laying
his
hand
upon
his
sire
's
shoulder
,
and
looking
down
into
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
I
have
come
back
,
poorer
than
a
church
mouse
?
 
<EOS>
You
know
that
.
 
<EOS>
That
I
have
come
back
,
maimed
and
crippled
?
 
<EOS>
You
know
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
took
off
,
"
muttered
Mr
Willet
,
with
his
eyes
upon
the
fire
,
"
at
the
defence
of
the
Salwanners
,
in
America
,
where
the
war
is
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
right
,
"
returned
Joe
,
smiling
,
and
leaning
with
his
remaining
elbow
on
the
back
of
his
father
's
chair
;
"
the
very
subject
I
came
to
speak
to
you
about
.
 
<EOS>
A
man
with
one
arm
,
father
,
is
not
of
much
use
in
the
busy
world
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
one
of
those
vast
propositions
which
Mr
Willet
had
never
considered
for
an
instant
,
and
required
time
to
"
tackle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Wherefore
he
made
no
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
At
all
events
,
"
said
Joe
,
"
he
ca
n't
pick
and
choose
his
means
of
earning
a
livelihood
,
as
another
man
may
.
 
<EOS>
He
ca
n't
say
"
I
will
turn
my
hand
to
this
,
"
or
"
I
wo
n't
turn
my
hand
to
that
,
"
but
must
take
what
he
can
do
,
and
be
thankful
<EOS>
it
's
no
worse
.
<EOS>
---
What
did
you
say
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Willet
had
been
softly
repeating
to
himself
,
in
a
musing
tone
,
the
words
"
defence
of
the
Salwanners
:
"
but
he
seemed
embarrassed
at
having
been
overheard
,
and
answered
"
Nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
look
here
,
father
.
---
<EOS>
Mr
Edward
has
come
to
England
from
the
West
Indies
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
was
lost
sight
of
(
I
ran
away
on
the
same
day
,
father
)
,
he
made
a
voyage
to
one
of
the
islands
,
where
a
school
-
friend
of
his
had
settled
;
and
,
finding
him
,
was
n't
too
proud
to
be
employed
on
his
estate
,
and
---
and
in
short
,
got
on
well
,
and
is
prospering
,
and
has
come
over
here
on
business
of
his
own
,
and
is
going
back
again
speedily
.
 
<EOS>
Our
returning
nearly
at
the
same
time
,
and
meeting
in
the
course
of
the
late
troubles
,
has
been
a
good
thing
every
way
;
for
it
has
not
only
enabled
us
to
do
old
friends
some
service
,
but
has
opened
a
path
in
life
for
me
which
I
may
tread
without
being
a
burden
upon
you
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
plain
,
father
,
he
can
employ
me
;
I
have
satisfied
myself
that
I
can
be
of
real
use
to
him
;
and
I
am
going
to
carry
my
one
arm
away
with
him
,
and
to
make
the
most
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
mind
's
eye
of
Mr
Willet
,
the
West
Indies
,
and
indeed
all
foreign
countries
,
were
inhabited
by
savage
nations
,
who
were
perpetually
burying
pipes
of
peace
,
flourishing
tomahawks
,
and
puncturing
strange
patterns
in
their
bodies
.
 
<EOS>
He
no
sooner
heard
this
announcement
,
therefore
,
than
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
,
took
his
pipe
from
his
lips
,
and
stared
at
his
son
with
as
much
dismay
as
if
he
already
beheld
him
tied
to
a
stake
,
and
tortured
for
the
entertainment
of
a
lively
population
.
 
<EOS>
In
what
form
of
expression
his
feelings
would
have
found
a
vent
,
it
is
impossible
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
is
it
necessary
:
for
,
before
a
syllable
occurred
to
him
,
<EOS>
Dolly
Varden
came
running
into
the
room
,
in
tears
,
threw
herself
on
Joe
's
breast
without
a
word
of
explanation
,
and
clasped
her
white
arms
round
his
neck
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dolly
!
"
cried
Joe
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dolly
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
call
me
that
;
call
me
that
always
,
"
exclaimed
the
locksmith
's
little
daughter
;
"
never
speak
coldly
to
me
,
never
be
distant
,
never
again
reprove
me
for
the
follies
I
have
long
repented
,
or
I
shall
die
,
Joe
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
reprove
you
!
"
said
Joe
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
---
for
every
kind
and
honest
word
you
uttered
,
went
to
my
heart
.
<EOS>
For
you
,
who
have
borne
so
much
from
me
---
for
you
,
who
owe
your
sufferings
and
pain
to
my
caprice
---
for
you
to
be
so
kind
---
so
noble
to
me
,
Joe
---
"
  
He
could
say
nothing
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
syllable
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
an
odd
sort
of
eloquence
in
his
one
arm
,
which
had
crept
round
her
waist
:
but
his
lips
were
mute
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
had
reminded
me
by
a
word
---
only
by
one
short
word
,
"
sobbed
Dolly
,
clinging
yet
closer
to
him
,
"
how
little
I
deserved
that
you
should
treat
me
with
so
much
forbearance
;
if
you
had
exulted
only
for
one
moment
in
your
triumph
,
I
could
have
borne
it
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Triumph
!
"
repeated
Joe
,
with
a
smile
which
seemed
to
say
,
"
I
am
a
pretty
figure
for
that
.
"
  
"
Yes
,
triumph
,
"
she
cried
,
with
her
whole
heart
and
soul
in
her
earnest
voice
,
and
gushing
tears
;
"
for
it
is
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
to
think
and
know
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
be
less
humbled
,
dear
<EOS>
---
I
would
n't
be
without
the
recollection
of
that
last
time
we
spoke
together
in
this
place
---
<EOS>
no
,
not
if
I
could
recall
the
past
,
and
make
our
parting
,
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
  
Did
ever
lover
look
as
Joe
looked
now
!
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Joe
,
"
said
Dolly
,
"
I
always
loved
you
---
<EOS>
in
my
own
heart
I
always
did
,
although
I
was
so
vain
and
giddy
.
 
<EOS>
I
hoped
you
would
come
back
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
quite
sure
you
would
.
 
<EOS>
I
prayed
for
it
on
my
knees
.
 
<EOS>
Through
all
these
long
,
long
years
,
I
have
never
once
forgotten
you
,
or
left
off
hoping
that
this
happy
time
might
come
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
eloquence
of
Joe
's
arm
surpassed
the
most
impassioned
language
;
and
so
did
that
of
his
lips
---
yet
he
said
nothing
,
either
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
at
last
,
"
cried
Dolly
,
trembling
with
the
fervour
of
her
speech
,
"
if
you
were
sick
,
and
shattered
in
your
every
limb
;
if
you
were
ailing
,
weak
,
and
sorrowful
;
if
,
instead
of
being
what
you
are
,
you
were
in
everybody
's
eyes
but
mine
the
wreck
and
ruin
of
a
man
;
I
would
be
your
wife
,
dear
love
,
with
greater
pride
and
joy
,
than
if
you
were
the
stateliest
lord
in
England
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
have
I
done
,
"
cried
Joe
,
"
what
have
I
done
to
meet
with
this
reward
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
taught
me
,
"
said
Dolly
,
raising
her
pretty
face
to
his
,
"
to
know
myself
,
and
your
worth
;
to
be
something
better
than
I
was
;
to
be
more
deserving
of
your
true
and
manly
nature
.
 
<EOS>
In
years
to
come
,
dear
Joe
,
you
shall
find
that
you
have
done
so
;
for
I
will
be
,
not
only
now
,
when
we
are
young
and
full
of
hope
,
but
when
we
have
grown
old
and
weary
,
your
patient
,
gentle
,
never
-
tiring
wife
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
never
know
a
wish
or
care
beyond
our
home
and
you
,
and
I
will
always
study
how
to
please
you
with
my
best
affection
and
my
most
devoted
love
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
:
indeed
I
will
!
"
  
<EOS>
Joe
could
only
repeat
his
former
eloquence
---
but
it
was
very
much
to
the
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
know
of
this
,
at
home
,
"
said
Dolly
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
your
sake
,
I
would
leave
even
them
;
but
they
know
it
,
and
are
glad
of
it
,
and
are
as
proud
of
you
as
I
am
,
and
as
full
of
gratitude
.
<EOS>
---
You
'll
not
come
and
see
me
as
a
poor
friend
who
knew
me
when
I
was
a
girl
,
will
you
,
dear
Joe
?
"
  
<EOS>
Well
,
well
!
 
<EOS>
It
do
n't
matter
what
Joe
said
in
answer
,
but
he
said
a
great
deal
;
and
Dolly
said
a
great
deal
too
:
and
he
folded
Dolly
in
his
one
arm
pretty
tight
,
considering
that
it
was
but
one
;
and
Dolly
made
no
resistance
:
and
if
ever
two
people
were
happy
in
this
world
---
which
is
not
an
utterly
miserable
one
,
with
all
its
faults
---
 
we
may
,
with
some
appearance
of
certainty
,
conclude
that
they
were
.
  
<EOS>
To
say
that
during
these
proceedings
Mr
Willet
the
elder
underwent
the
greatest
emotions
of
astonishment
of
which
our
common
nature
is
susceptible
---
to
say
that
he
was
in
a
perfect
paralysis
of
surprise
,
and
that
he
wandered
into
the
most
stupendous
and
theretofore
unattainable
heights
of
complicated
amazement
---
would
be
to
shadow
forth
his
state
of
mind
in
the
feeblest
and
lamest
terms
.
 
<EOS>
If
a
roc
,

eagle

griffin

flying
elephant

winged
sea
-
horse
,
had
suddenly
appeared
,
and
,
taking
him
on
its
back
,
carried
him
bodily
into
the
heart
of
the
"
Salwanners
,
"
it
would
have
been
to
him
as
an
everyday
occurrence
,
in
comparison
with
what
he
now
beheld
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
sitting
quietly
by
,
seeing
and
hearing
these
things
;
to
be
completely
overlooked
,
unnoticed
,
and
disregarded
,
while
his
son
and
a
young
lady
were
talking
to
each
other
in
the
most
impassioned
manner
,
kissing
each
other
,
and
making
themselves
in
all
respects
perfectly
at
home
;
was
a
position
so
tremendous
,
so
inexplicable
,
so
utterly
beyond
the
widest
range
of
his
capacity
of
comprehension
,
that
he
fell
into
a
lethargy
of
wonder
,
and
could
no
more
rouse
himself
than
an
enchanted
sleeper
in
the
first
year
of
his
fairy
lease
,
a
century
long
.
  
<EOS>
"
Father
,
"
said
Joe
,
presenting
Dolly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
who
this
is
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Willet
looked
first
at
her
,
then
at
his
son
,
then
back
again
at
Dolly
,
and
then
made
an
ineffectual
effort
to
extract
a
whiff
from
his
pipe
,
which
had
gone
out
long
ago
.
  
<EOS>
"
Say
a
word
,
father
,
if
it
's
only
"
how
d'ye
do
,
"
"
urged
Joe
.
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
Joseph
,
"
answered
Mr
Willet
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
!
 
<EOS>
Why
not
?
"
  
"
To
be
sure
,
"
said
Joe
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
"
replied
his
father
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
<EOS>
and
with
this
remark
,
which
he
uttered
in
a
low
voice
as
though
he
were
discussing
some
grave
question
with
himself
,
he
used
the
little
finger
---
if
any
of
his
fingers
can
be
said
to
have
come
under
that
denomination
---
of
his
right
hand
as
a
tobacco
-
stopper
,
and
was
silent
again
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
he
sat
for
half
an
hour
at
least
,
although
Dolly
,
in
the
most
endearing
of
manners
,
hoped
,
a
dozen
times
,
that
he
was
not
angry
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
sat
for
half
an
hour
,
quite
motionless
,
and
looking
all
the
while
<EOS>
like
nothing
so
much
as
a
great
Dutch
Pin
or
Skittle
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
expiration
of
that
period
,
he
suddenly
,
and
without
the
least
notice
,
burst
(
to
the
great
consternation
of
the
young
people
)
into
a
very
loud
and
very
short
laugh
;
and
repeating
,
"
Certainly
,
Joseph
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
yes
!
 
<EOS>
Why
not
?
"
went
out
for
a
walk
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
79
    
Old
John
did
not
walk
near
the
Golden
Key
,
for
between
the
Golden
Key
and
the
Black
Lion
there
lay
a
wilderness
of
streets
---
as
everybody
knows
who
is
acquainted
with
the
relative
bearings
of
Clerkenwell
and
Whitechapel
---
and
he
was
by
no
means
famous
for
pedestrian
exercises
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
Golden
Key
lies
in
our
way
,
though
it
was
out
of
his
;
so
to
the
Golden
Key
this
chapter
goes
.
  
<EOS>
The
Golden
Key
itself
,
fair
emblem
of
the
locksmith
's
trade
,
had
been
pulled
down
by
the
rioters
,
and
roughly
trampled
under
foot
.
<EOS>
But
,
now
,
it
was
hoisted
up
again
in
all
the
glory
of
a
new
coat
of
paint
,
and
shewed
more
bravely
even
than
in
days
of
yore
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
the
whole
house
-
front
was
spruce
and
trim
,
and
so
freshened
up
throughout
,
that
if
there
yet
remained
at
large
any
of
the
rioters
who
had
been
concerned
in
the
attack
upon
it
,
the
sight
of
the
old
,
goodly
,
prosperous
dwelling
,
so
revived
,
must
have
been
to
them
as
gall
and
wormwood
.
  
<EOS>
The
shutters
of
the
shop
were
closed
,
however
,
and
the
window
-
blinds
above
were
all
pulled
down
,
and
in
place
of
its
usual
cheerful
appearance
,
the
house
had
a
look
of
sadness
and
an
air
of
mourning
;
which
the
neighbours
,
who
in
old
days
had
often
seen
poor
Barnaby
go
in
and
out
,
were
at
no
loss
to
understand
.
 
<EOS>
The
door
stood
partly
open
;
but
the
locksmith
's
hammer
was
unheard
;
the
cat
sat
moping
on
the
ashy
forge
;
all
was
deserted
,
dark
,
and
silent
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
threshold
of
this
door
,
Mr
Haredale
and
Edward
Chester
met
.
<EOS>
The
younger
man
gave
place
;
and
both
passing
in
with
a
familiar
air
,
which
seemed
to
denote
that
they
were
tarrying
there
,
or
were
well
-
accustomed
to
go
to
and
fro
unquestioned
,
shut
it
behind
them
.
  
<EOS>
Entering
the
old
back
-
parlour
,
and
ascending
the
flight
of
stairs
,
abrupt
and
steep
,
and
quaintly
fashioned
as
of
old
,
they
turned
into
the
best
room
;
the
pride
of
Mrs
Varden
's
heart
,
and
erst
the
scene
of
Miggs
's
household
labours
.
  
<EOS>
"
Varden
brought
the
mother
here
last
evening
,
he
told
me
?
"
said
Mr
Haredale
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
above
-
stairs
now
---
in
the
room
over
here
,
"
Edward
rejoined
.
"
<EOS>
Her
grief
,
they
say
,
is
past
all
telling
.
 
<EOS>
I
need
n't
add
---
for
that
you
know
beforehand
,
sir
---
that
the
care
,
humanity
,
and
sympathy
of
these
good
people
have
no
bounds
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
repay
them
for
it
,
and
for
much
more
!
<EOS>
Varden
is
out
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
returned
with
your
messenger
,
who
arrived
almost
at
the
moment
of
his
coming
home
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
out
the
whole
night
---
but
that
of
course
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
with
you
the
greater
part
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
was
.
 
<EOS>
Without
him
,
I
should
have
lacked
my
right
hand
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
an
older
man
than
I
;
but
nothing
can
conquer
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
cheeriest
,
stoutest
-
hearted
fellow
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
a
right
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
a
right
to
he
.
 
<EOS>
A
better
creature
never
lived
.
 
<EOS>
He
reaps
what
he
has
sown
---
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
all
men
,
"
said
Edward
,
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
"
who
have
the
happiness
to
do
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
More
than
you
imagine
,
"
returned
Mr
Haredale
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
note
the
harvest
more
than
the
seed
-
time
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
so
in
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
truth
his
pale
and
haggard
face
,
and
gloomy
bearing
,
had
so
far
influenced
the
remark
,
that
Edward
was
,
for
the
moment
,
at
a
loss
to
answer
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tut
,
tut
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
"
'
<EOS>
twas
not
very
difficult
to
read
a
thought
so
natural
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
are
mistaken
nevertheless
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
had
my
share
of
sorrows
---
more
than
the
common
lot
,
perhaps
,
but
I
have
borne
them
ill
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
broken
where
I
should
have
bent
;
and
have
mused
and
brooded
,
when
my
spirit
should
have
mixed
with
all
God
's
great
creation
.
 
<EOS>
The
men
who
learn
endurance
,
are
they
who
call
the
whole
world
,
brother
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
turned
FROM
the
world
,
and
I
pay
the
penalty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Edward
would
have
interposed
,
but
he
went
on
without
giving
him
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
too
late
to
evade
it
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
sometimes
think
,
that
if
I
had
to
live
my
life
once
more
,
I
might
amend
this
fault
---
not
so
much
,
I
discover
when
I
search
my
mind
,
for
the
love
of
what
is
right
,
as
for
my
own
sake
.
 
<EOS>
But
even
when
I
make
these
better
resolutions
,
I
instinctively
recoil
from
the
idea
of
suffering
again
what
I
have
undergone
;
and
in
this
circumstance
I
find
the
unwelcome
assurance
that
I
should
still
be
the
same
man
,
though
I
could
cancel
the
past
,
and
begin
anew
,
with
its
experience
to
guide
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
you
make
too
sure
of
that
,
"
said
Edward
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
so
,
"
Mr
Haredale
answered
,
"
and
I
am
glad
you
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
myself
better
,
and
therefore
distrust
myself
more
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
leave
this
subject
for
another
---
not
so
far
removed
from
it
as
it
might
,
at
first
sight
,
seem
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
you
still
love
my
niece
,
and
she
is
still
attached
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
that
assurance
from
her
own
lips
,
"
said
Edward
,
"
and
you
know
---
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
know
---
that
I
would
not
exchange
it
for
any
blessing
life
could
yield
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
frank
,
honourable
,
and
disinterested
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
;
"
you
have
forced
the
conviction
that
you
are
so
,
even
on
my
once
-
jaundiced
mind
,
and
I
believe
you
.
 
<EOS>
Wait
here
till
I
come
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
left
the
room
as
he
spoke
;
but
soon
returned
with
his
niece
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
On
that
first
and
only
time
,
"
he
said
,
looking
from
the
one
to
the
other
,
"
when
we
three
stood
together
under
her
father
's
roof
,
I
told
you
to
quit
it
,
and
charged
you
never
to
return
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
only
circumstance
arising
out
of
our
love
,
"
observed
Edward
,
"
that
I
have
forgotten
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
own
a
name
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
"
I
had
deep
reason
to
remember
.
<EOS>
I
was
moved
and
goaded
by
recollections
of
personal
wrong
and
injury
,
I
know
,
but
,
even
now
I
can
not
charge
myself
with
having
,
then
,
or
ever
,
lost
sight
of
a
heartfelt
desire
for
her
true
happiness
;
or
with
having
acted
---
however
much
I
was
mistaken
---
with
any
other
impulse
than
the
one
pure
,
single
,
earnest
wish
to
be
to
her
,
as
far
as
in
my
inferior
nature
lay
,
the
father
she
had
lost
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Dear
uncle
,
"
cried
Emma
,
"
I
have
known
no
parent
but
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
loved
the
memory
of
others
,
but
I
have
loved
you
all
my
life
.
<EOS>
Never
was
father
kinder
to
his
child
than
you
have
been
to
me
,
without
the
interval
of
one
harsh
hour
,
since
I
can
first
remember
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
speak
too
fondly
,
"
he
answered
,
"
<EOS>
and
yet
I
can
not
wish
you
were
less
partial
;
for
I
have
a
pleasure
in
hearing
those
words
,
and
shall
have
in
calling
them
to
mind
when
we
are
far
asunder
,
which
nothing
else
could
give
me
.
 
<EOS>
Bear
with
me
for
a
moment
longer
,
Edward
,
for
she
and
I
have
been
together
many
years
;
and
although
I
believe
that
in
resigning
her
to
you
I
put
the
seal
upon
her
future
happiness
,
I
find
it
needs
an
effort
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
pressed
her
tenderly
to
his
bosom
,
and
after
a
minute
's
pause
,
resumed
:
  
"
I
have
done
you
wrong
,
sir
,
and
I
ask
your
forgiveness
---
in
no
common
phrase
,
or
show
of
sorrow
;
but
with
earnestness
and
sincerity
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
same
spirit
,
I
acknowledge
to
you
both
that
the
time
has
been
when
I
connived
at
treachery
and
falsehood
---
which
if
I
did
not
perpetrate
myself
,
I
still
permitted
---
to
rend
you
two
asunder
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
judge
yourself
too
harshly
,
"
said
Edward
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
these
things
rest
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
rise
in
judgment
against
me
when
I
look
back
,
and
not
now
for
the
first
time
,
"
he
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
part
from
you
without
your
full
forgiveness
;
for
busy
life
<EOS>
and
I
have
little
left
in
common
now
,
and
I
have
regrets
enough
to
carry
into
solitude
,
without
addition
to
the
stock
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
bear
a
blessing
from
us
both
,
"
said
Emma
.
 
<EOS>
"
Never
mingle
thoughts
of
me
---
of
me
who
owe
you
so
much
love
and
duty
---
with
anything
but
undying
affection
and
gratitude
for
the
past
,
and
bright
hopes
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
future
,
"
returned
her
uncle
,
with
a
melancholy
smile
,
"
is
a
bright
word
for
you
,
and
its
image
should
be
wreathed
with
cheerful
hopes
.
 
<EOS>
Mine
is
of
another
kind
,
but
it
will
be
one
of
peace
,
and
free
,
I
trust
,
from
care
or
passion
.
 
<EOS>
When
you
quit
England
I
shall
leave
it
too
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
cloisters
abroad
;
and
now
that
the
two
great
objects
of
my
life
are
set
at
rest
,
I
know
no
better
home
.
 
<EOS>
You
droop
at
that
,
forgetting
that
I
am
growing
old
,
and
that
my
course
is
nearly
run
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
we
will
speak
of
it
again
---
 
not
once
or
twice
,
but
many
times
;
and
you
shall
give
me
cheerful
counsel
,
Emma
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
will
take
it
?
"
asked
his
niece
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
listen
to
it
,
"
he
answered
,
with
a
kiss
,
"
and
it
will
have
its
weight
,
be
certain
.
 
<EOS>
What
have
I
left
to
say
?
 
<EOS>
You
have
,
of
late
,
been
much
together
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
better
and
more
fitting
that
the
circumstances
attendant
on
the
past
,
which
wrought
your
separation
,
and
sowed
between
you
suspicion
and
distrust
,
should
not
be
entered
on
by
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Much
,
much
better
,
"
whispered
Emma
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
avow
my
share
in
them
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
"
though
I
held
it
,
at
the
time
,
in
detestation
.
 
<EOS>
Let
no
man
turn
aside
,
ever
so
slightly
,
from
the
broad
path
of
honour
,
on
the
plausible
pretence
that
he
is
justified
by
the
goodness
of
his
end
.
 
<EOS>
All
good
ends
<EOS>
can
he
worked
out
by
good
means
.
 
<EOS>
Those
that
can
not
,
are
bad
;
and
may
be
counted
so
at
once
,
and
left
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
from
her
to
Edward
,
and
said
in
a
gentler
tone
:
  
"
<EOS>
In
goods
and
fortune
you
are
now
nearly
equal
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
her
faithful
steward
,
and
to
that
remnant
of
a
richer
property
which
my
brother
left
her
,
I
desire
to
add
,
in
token
of
my
love
,
a
poor
pittance
,
scarcely
worth
the
mention
,
for
which
I
have
no
longer
any
need
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
you
go
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
Let
our
ill
-
fated
house
remain
the
ruin
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
When
you
return
,
after
a
few
thriving
years
,
you
will
command
a
better
,
and
a
more
fortunate
one
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
friends
?
"
  
<EOS>
Edward
took
his
extended
hand
,
and
grasped
it
heartily
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
neither
slow
nor
cold
in
your
response
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
doing
the
like
by
him
,
"
and
when
I
look
upon
you
now
,
and
know
you
,
I
feel
that
I
would
choose
you
for
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
Her
father
had
a
generous
nature
,
and
you
would
have
pleased
him
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
give
her
to
you
in
his
name
,
and
with
his
blessing
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
world
and
I
part
in
this
act
,
we
part
on
happier
terms
than
we
have
lived
for
many
a
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
placed
her
in
his
arms
,
and
would
have
left
the
room
,
but
that
he
was
stopped
in
his
passage
to
the
door
by
a
great
noise
at
a
distance
,
which
made
them
start
and
pause
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
loud
shouting
,
mingled
with
boisterous
acclamations
,
that
rent
the
very
air
.
 
<EOS>
It
drew
nearer
and
nearer
every
moment
,
and
approached
so
rapidly
,
that
,
even
while
they
listened
,
it
burst
into
a
deafening
confusion
of
sounds
at
the
street
corner
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
must
be
stopped
---
quieted
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
hastily
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
should
have
foreseen
this
,
and
provided
against
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
go
out
to
them
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
,
before
he
could
reach
the
door
,
and
before
Edward
could
catch
up
his
hat
and
follow
him
,
they
were
again
arrested
by
a
loud
shriek
from
above
-
stairs
:
and
<EOS>
the
locksmith
's
wife
,
bursting
in
,
and
fairly
running
into
Mr
Haredale
's
arms
,
cried
out
:
  
"
<EOS>
She
knows
it
all
,
dear
sir
!
<EOS>
---
she
knows
it
all
!
 
<EOS>
We
broke
it
out
to
her
by
degrees
,
and
she
is
quite
prepared
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Having
made
this
communication
,
and
furthermore
thanked
Heaven
with
great
fervour
and
heartiness
,
the
good
lady
,
according
to
the
custom
of
matrons
,
on
all
occasions
of
excitement
,
fainted
away
directly
.
  
<EOS>
They
ran
to
the
window
,
drew
up
the
sash
,
and
looked
into
the
crowded
street
.
 
<EOS>
Among
a
dense
mob
of
persons
,
of
whom
not
one
was
for
an
instant
still
,
the
locksmith
's
ruddy
face
and
burly
form
could
be
descried
,
beating
about
as
though
he
was
struggling
with
a
rough
sea
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
he
was
carried
back
a
score
of
yards
,
now
onward
nearly
to
the
door
,
now
back
again
,
now
forced
against
the
opposite
houses
,
now
against
those
adjoining
his
own
:
now
carried
up
a
flight
of
steps
,
and
greeted
by
the
outstretched
hands
of
half
a
hundred
men
,
while
the
whole
tumultuous
concourse
stretched
their
throats
,
and
cheered
with
all
their
might
.
 
<EOS>
Though
he
was
really
in
a
fair
way
to
be
torn
to
pieces
in
the
general
enthusiasm
,
the
locksmith
,
nothing
discomposed
,
echoed
their
shouts
till
he
was
as
hoarse
as
they
,
and
in
a
glow
of
joy
and
right
good
-
humour
,
waved
his
hat
until
the
daylight
shone
between
its
brim
and
crown
.
  
<EOS>
But
in
all
the
bandyings
from
hand
to
hand
,
and
strivings
to
and
fro
,
and
sweepings
here
and
there
,
which
---
saving
that
he
looked
more
jolly
and
more
radiant
after
every
struggle
---
troubled
his
peace
of
mind
no
more
than
if
he
had
been
a
straw
upon
the
water
's
surface
,
he
never
once
released
his
firm
grasp
of
an
arm
,
drawn
tight
through
his
.
 
<EOS>
He
sometimes
turned
to
clap
this
friend
upon
the
back
,
or
whisper
in
his
ear
a
word
of
staunch
encouragement
,
or
cheer
him
with
a
smile
;
but
his
great
care
was
to
shield
him
from
the
pressure
,
and
force
a
passage
for
him
to
the
Golden
Key
.
<EOS>
Passive
and
timid
,
scared
,
pale
,
and
wondering
,
and
gazing
at
the
throng
as
if
he
were
newly
risen
from
the
dead
,
and
felt
himself
a
ghost
among
the
living
,
Barnaby
---
not
Barnaby
in
the
spirit
,
but
in
flesh
and
blood
,
with
pulses
,
sinews
,
nerves
,
and
beating
heart
,
and
strong
affections
---
clung
to
his
stout
old
friend
,
and
followed
where
he
led
.
  
<EOS>
And
thus
,
in
course
of
time
,
they
reached
the
door
,
held
ready
for
their
entrance
by
no
unwilling
hands
.
 
<EOS>
Then
slipping
in
,
and
shutting
out
the
crowd
by
main
force
,
Gabriel
stood
between
Mr
Haredale
and
Edward
Chester
,
and
Barnaby
,
rushing
up
the
stairs
,
fell
upon
his
knees
beside
his
mother
's
bed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Such
is
the
blessed
end
,
sir
,
"
cried
the
panting
locksmith
,
to
Mr
Haredale
,
"
of
the
best
day
's
work
we
ever
did
.
 
<EOS>
The
rogues
!
<EOS>
it
's
been
hard
fighting
to
get
away
from
'em
.
 
<EOS>
I
almost
thought
,
once
or
twice
,
they
'd
have
been
too
much
for
us
with
their
kindness
!
"
  
<EOS>
They
had
striven
,
all
the
previous
day
,
to
rescue
Barnaby
from
his
impending
fate
.
 
<EOS>
Failing
in
their
attempts
,
in
the
first
quarter
to
which
they
addressed
themselves
,
they
renewed
them
in
another
.
<EOS>
Failing
there
,
likewise
,
they
began
afresh
at
midnight
;
and
made
their
way
,
not
only
to
the
judge
and
jury
who
had
tried
him
,
but
to
men
of
influence
at
court
,
to
the
young
Prince
of
Wales
,
and
even
to
the
ante
-
chamber
of
the
King
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Successful
,
at
last
,
in
awakening
an
interest
in
his
favour
,
and
an
inclination
to
inquire
more
dispassionately
into
his
case
,
they
had
had
an
interview
with
the
minister
,
in
his
bed
,
so
late
as
eight
o'clock
that
morning
.
<EOS>
The
result
of
a
searching
inquiry
(
in
which
they
,
who
had
known
the
poor
fellow
from
his
childhood
,
did
other
good
service
,
besides
bringing
it
about
)
was
,
that
between
eleven
and
twelve
o'clock
,
a
free
pardon
to
Barnaby
Rudge
was
made
out
and
signed
,
and
entrusted
to
a
horse
-
soldier
for
instant
conveyance
to
the
place
of
execution
.
 
<EOS>
This
courier
reached
the
spot
just
as
the
cart
appeared
in
sight
;
and
Barnaby
being
carried
back
to
jail
,
Mr
Haredale
,
assured
that
all
was
safe
,
had
gone
straight
from
Bloomsbury
Square
to
the
Golden
Key
,
leaving
to
Gabriel
the
grateful
task
of
bringing
him
home
in
triumph
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
need
n't
say
,
"
observed
the
locksmith
,
when
he
had
shaken
hands
with
all
the
males
in
the
house
,
and
hugged
all
the
females
,
five
-
and
-
forty
times
,
at
least
,
"
that
,
except
among
ourselves
,
I
did
n't
want
to
make
a
triumph
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
directly
we
got
into
the
street
we
were
known
,
and
this
hubbub
began
.
 
<EOS>
Of
the
two
,
"
he
added
,
as
he
wiped
his
crimson
face
,
"
and
after
experience
of
both
,
I
think
I
'd
rather
be
taken
out
of
my
house
by
a
crowd
of
enemies
,
than
escorted
home
by
a
mob
of
friends
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
plain
enough
,
however
,
that
this
was
mere
talk
on
Gabriel
's
part
,
and
that
the
whole
proceeding
afforded
him
the
keenest
delight
;
for
the
people
continuing
to
make
a
great
noise
without
,
and
to
cheer
as
if
their
voices
were
in
the
freshest
order
,
and
good
for
a
fortnight
,
he
sent
upstairs
for
Grip
(
who
had
come
home
at
his
master
's
back
,
and
had
acknowledged
the
favours
of
the
multitude
by
drawing
blood
from
every
finger
that
came
within
his
reach
)
,
and
with
the
bird
upon
his
arm
presented
himself
at
the
first
-
floor
window
,
and
waved
his
hat
again
until
it
dangled
by
a
shred
,
between
his
finger
and
thumb
.
 
<EOS>
This
demonstration
having
been
received
with
appropriate
shouts
,
and
silence
being
in
some
degree
restored
,
he
thanked
them
for
their
sympathy
;
and
taking
the
liberty
to
inform
them
that
there
was
a
sick
person
in
the
house
,
proposed
that
they
should
give
three
cheers
for
King
George
,
three
more
for
Old
England
,
and
three
more
for
nothing
particular
,
as
a
closing
ceremony
.
 
<EOS>
The
crowd
assenting
,
substituted
Gabriel
Varden
for
the
nothing
particular
;
and
giving
him
one
over
,
for
good
measure
,
dispersed
in
high
good
-
humour
.
  
<EOS>
What
congratulations
were
exchanged
among
the
inmates
at
the
Golden
Key
,
when
they
were
left
alone
;
what
an
overflowing
of
joy
and
happiness
<EOS>
there
was
among
them
;
how
incapable
it
was
of
expression
in
Barnaby
's
own
person
;
and
how
he
went
wildly
from
one
to
another
,
until
he
became
so
far
tranquillised
,
as
to
stretch
himself
on
the
ground
beside
his
mother
's
couch
and
fall
into
a
deep
sleep
;
are
matters
that
need
not
be
told
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
is
well
<EOS>
they
happened
to
be
of
this
class
,
for
they
would
be
very
hard
to
tell
,
were
their
narration
ever
so
indispensable
.
  
<EOS>
Before
leaving
this
bright
picture
,
it
may
be
well
to
glance
at
a
dark
and
very
different
one
which
was
presented
to
only
a
few
eyes
,
that
same
night
.
  
<EOS>
The
scene
was
a
churchyard
;
the
time
,
midnight
;
the
persons
,
Edward
Chester
,
a
clergyman
,
a
grave
-
digger
,
and
the
four
bearers
of
a
homely
coffin
.
 
<EOS>
They
stood
about
a
grave
which
had
been
newly
dug
,
and
one
of
the
bearers
held
up
a
dim
lantern
,
---
the
only
light
there
---
which
shed
its
feeble
ray
upon
the
book
of
prayer
.
 
<EOS>
He
placed
it
for
a
moment
on
the
coffin
,
when
he
and
his
companions
were
about
to
lower
it
down
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
inscription
on
the
lid
.
  
<EOS>
The
mould
fell
solemnly
upon
the
last
house
of
this
nameless
man
;
and
the
rattling
dust
left
a
dismal
echo
even
in
the
accustomed
ears
of
those
who
had
borne
it
to
its
resting
-
place
.
 
<EOS>
The
grave
was
filled
in
to
the
top
,
and
trodden
down
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
left
the
spot
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
never
saw
him
,
living
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
clergyman
,
of
Edward
.
  
<EOS>
"
Often
,
years
ago
;
not
knowing
him
for
my
brother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
since
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
.
 
<EOS>
Yesterday
,
he
steadily
refused
to
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
urged
upon
him
,
many
times
,
at
my
desire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Still
he
refused
?
 
<EOS>
That
was
hardened
and
unnatural
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
infer
that
you
do
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
.
 
<EOS>
We
hear
the
world
wonder
,
every
day
,
at
monsters
of
ingratitude
.
 
<EOS>
Did
it
never
occur
to
you
that
it
often
looks
for
monsters
of
affection
,
as
though
they
were
things
of
course
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
had
reached
the
gate
by
this
time
,
and
bidding
each
other
good
night
,
departed
on
their
separate
ways
.

Chapter

<EOS>
That
afternoon
,
when
he
had
slept
off
his
fatigue
;
had
shaved
,
and
washed
,
and
dressed
,
and
freshened
himself
from
top
to
toe
;
when
he
had
dined
,
comforted
himself
with
a
pipe
,
an
extra
Toby
,
a
nap
in
the
great
arm
-
chair
,
and
a
quiet
chat
with
Mrs
Varden
on
everything
that
had
happened
,
was
happening
,
or
about
to
happen
,
within
the
sphere
of
their
domestic
concern
;
the
locksmith
sat
himself
down
at
the
tea
-
table
in
the
little
back
-
parlour
:
the
rosiest
,
cosiest
,
merriest
,
heartiest
,
best
-
contented
old
buck
,
in
Great
Britain
or
out
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
There
he
sat
,
with
his
beaming
eye
on
Mrs
V
,
and
his
shining
face
suffused
with
gladness
,
and
his
capacious
waistcoat
smiling
in
every
wrinkle
,
and
his
jovial
humour
peeping
from
under
the
table
in
the
very
plumpness
of
his
legs
;
a
sight
to
turn
the
vinegar
of
misanthropy
into
purest
milk
of
human
kindness
.
 
<EOS>
There
he
sat
,
watching
his
wife
as
she
decorated
the
room
with
flowers
for
the
greater
honour
of
Dolly
and
Joseph
Willet
,
who
had
gone
out
walking
,
and
for
whom
the
tea
-
kettle
had
been
singing
gaily
on
the
hob
full
twenty
minutes
,
chirping
as
never
kettle
chirped
before
;
for
whom
the
best
service
of
real
undoubted
china
,
patterned
with
divers
round
-
faced
mandarins
holding
up
broad
umbrellas
,
was
now
displayed
in
all
its
glory
;
to
tempt
whose
appetites
a
clear
,
transparent
,
juicy
ham
,
garnished
with
cool
green
lettuce
-
leaves
and
fragrant
cucumber
,
reposed
upon
a
shady
table
,
covered
with
a
snow
-
white
cloth
;
for
whose
delight
,
preserves
and
jams
,
crisp
cakes
and
other
pastry
,
short
to
eat
,
with
cunning
twists
,
and
cottage
loaves
,
and
rolls
of
bread
both
white
and
brown
,
were
all
set
forth
in
rich
profusion
;
in
whose
youth
Mrs
V
 
herself
had
grown
quite
young
,
and
stood
there
in
a
gown
of
red
and
white
:
symmetrical
in
figure
,
buxom
in
bodice
,
ruddy
in
cheek
and
lip
,
faultless
in
ankle
,
laughing
in
face
and
mood
,
in
all
respects
delicious
to
behold
---
there
sat
the
locksmith
among
all
and
every
these
delights
,
the
sun
that
shone
upon
them
all
:
the
centre
of
the
system
:
the
source
of
light
,
heat
,
life
,
and
frank
enjoyment
in
the
bright
household
world
.
  
<EOS>
And
when
had
Dolly
ever
been
the
Dolly
of
that
afternoon
?
 
<EOS>
To
see
how
she
came
in
,
arm
-
in
-
arm
with
Joe
;
and
how
she
made
an
effort
not
to
blush
or
seem
at
all
confused
;
and
how
she
made
believe
she
did
n't
care
to
sit
on
his
side
of
the
table
;
and
how
she
coaxed
the
locksmith
in
a
whisper
not
to
joke
;
and
how
her
colour
came
and
went
in
a
little
restless
flutter
of
happiness
,
which
made
her
do
everything
wrong
,
and
yet
so
charmingly
wrong
that
it
was
better
than
right
!
<EOS>
---
why
,
the
locksmith
could
have
looked
on
at
this
(
as
he
mentioned
to
Mrs
Varden
when
they
retired
for
the
night
)
for
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
at
a
stretch
,
and
never
wished
it
done
.
  
<EOS>
The
recollections
,
too
,
with
which
they
made
merry
over
that
long
protracted
tea
!
 
<EOS>
The
glee
with
which
the
locksmith
asked
Joe
if
he
remembered
that
stormy
night
at
the
Maypole
when
he
first
asked
after
Dolly
---
the
laugh
they
all
had
,
about
that
night
when
she
was
going
out
to
the
party
in
the
sedan
-
chair
---
the
unmerciful
manner
in
which
they
rallied
Mrs
Varden
about
putting
those
flowers
outside
that
very
window
---
the
difficulty
Mrs
Varden
found
in
joining
the
laugh
against
herself
,
at
first
,
and
the
extraordinary
perception
she
had
of
the
joke
when
she
overcame
it
---
the
confidential
statements
of
Joe
concerning
the
precise
day
and
hour
when
he
was
first
conscious
of
being
fond
of
Dolly
,
and
Dolly
's
blushing
admissions
,
half
volunteered
and
half
extorted
,
as
to
the
time
from
which
she
dated
the
discovery
that
she
"
did
n't
mind
"
Joe
---
here
was
an
exhaustless
fund
of
mirth
and
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
there
was
a
great
deal
to
be
said
regarding
Mrs
Varden
's
doubts
,
and
motherly
alarms
,
and
shrewd
suspicions
;
and
it
appeared
that
from
Mrs
Varden
's
penetration
and
extreme
sagacity
nothing
had
ever
been
hidden
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
known
it
all
along
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
seen
it
from
the
first
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
always
predicted
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
been
aware
of
it
before
the
principals
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
said
within
herself
(
for
she
remembered
the
exact
words
)
"
that
young
Willet
is
certainly
looking
after
our
Dolly
,
and
I
must
look
after
HIM
.
"
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
she
had
looked
after
him
,
and
had
observed
many
little
circumstances
(
all
of
which
she
named
)
<EOS>
so
exceedingly
minute
that
nobody
else
could
make
anything
out
of
them
even
now
;
and
had
<EOS>
,
it
seemed
from
first
to
last
,
displayed
the
most
unbounded
tact
and
most
consummate
generalship
.
  
<EOS>
Of
course
the
night
when
Joe
WOULD
ride
homeward
by
the
side
of
the
chaise
,
and
when
Mrs
Varden
WOULD
insist
upon
his
going
back
again
,
was
not
forgotten
---
nor
the
night
when
Dolly
fainted
on
his
name
being
mentioned
---
nor
the
times
upon
times
when
Mrs
Varden
,
ever
watchful
and
prudent
,
had
found
her
pining
in
her
own
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
nothing
was
forgotten
;
and
everything
by
some
means
or
other
brought
them
back
to
the
conclusion
,
that
that
was
the
happiest
hour
in
all
their
lives
;
consequently
,
that
everything
must
have
occurred
for
the
best
,
and
nothing
could
be
suggested
which
would
have
made
it
better
.
  
<EOS>
While
they
were
in
the
full
glow
of
such
discourse
as
this
,
there
came
a
startling
knock
at
the
door
,
opening
from
the
street
into
the
workshop
,
which
had
been
kept
closed
all
day
that
the
house
might
be
more
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
Joe
,
as
in
duty
bound
,
would
hear
of
nobody
but
himself
going
to
open
it
;
and
accordingly
left
the
room
for
that
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
odd
enough
,
certainly
,
if
Joe
had
forgotten
the
way
to
this
door
;
and
even
if
he
had
,
as
it
was
a
pretty
large
one
and
stood
straight
before
him
,
he
could
not
easily
have
missed
it
.
<EOS>
But
Dolly
,
perhaps
because
she
was
in
the
flutter
of
spirits
before
mentioned
,
or
perhaps
because
she
thought
he
would
not
be
able
to
open
it
with
his
one
arm
---
she
could
have
had
no
other
reason
---
 
<EOS>
hurried
out
after
him
;
and
they
stopped
so
long
in
the
passage
---
no
doubt
owing
to
Joe
's
entreaties
that
she
would
not
expose
herself
to
the
draught
of
July
air
which
must
infallibly
come
rushing
in
on
this
same
door
being
opened
---
that
the
knock
was
repeated
,
in
a
yet
more
startling
manner
than
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
anybody
going
to
open
that
door
?
"
cried
the
locksmith
.
 
<EOS>
"
Or
shall
I
come
?
"
  
<EOS>
Upon
that
,
Dolly
went
running
back
into
the
parlour
,
all
dimples
and
blushes
;
and
Joe
opened
it
with
a
mighty
noise
,
and
other
superfluous
demonstrations
of
being
in
a
violent
hurry
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
the
locksmith
,
when
he
reappeared
:
"
what
is
it
?
 
<EOS>
eh
Joe
?
<EOS>
what
are
you
laughing
at
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
coming
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
's
coming
in
?
<EOS>
what
's
coming
in
?
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Varden
,
as
much
at
a
loss
as
her
husband
,
could
only
shake
her
head
in
answer
to
his
inquiring
look
:
so
,
the
locksmith
wheeled
his
chair
round
to
command
a
better
view
of
the
room
-
door
,
and
stared
at
it
with
his
eyes
wide
open
,
and
a
mingled
expression
of
curiosity
and
wonder
shining
in
his
jolly
face
.
  
<EOS>
Instead
of
some
person
or
persons
straightway
appearing
,
divers
remarkable
sounds
were
heard
,
first
in
the
workshop
and
afterwards
in
the
little
dark
passage
between
it
and
the
parlour
,
as
though
some
unwieldy
chest
or
heavy
piece
of
furniture
were
being
brought
in
,
by
an
amount
of
human
strength
inadequate
to
the
task
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
after
much
struggling
and
humping
,
and
bruising
of
the
wall
on
both
sides
,
the
door
was
forced
open
as
by
a
battering
-
ram
;
and
the
locksmith
,
steadily
regarding
what
appeared
beyond
,
smote
his
thigh
,
elevated
his
eyebrows
,
opened
his
mouth
,
and
cried
in
a
loud
voice
expressive
of
the
utmost
consternation
:
  
"
<EOS>
Damme
,
if
it
an't
Miggs
come
back
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
young
damsel
whom
he
named
no
sooner
heard
these
words
,
than
deserting
a
small
boy
and
a
very
large
box
by
which
she
was
accompanied
,
and
advancing
with
such
precipitation
that
her
bonnet
flew
off
her
head
,
burst
into
the
room
,
clasped
her
hands
(
in
which
she
held
a
pair
of
pattens
,
one
in
each
)
,
raised
her
eyes
devotedly
to
the
ceiling
,
and
shed
a
flood
of
tears
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
old
story
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
locksmith
,
looking
at
her
in
inexpressible
desperation
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
was
born
to
be
a
damper
,
this
young
woman
!
<EOS>
nothing
can
prevent
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ho
master
,
ho
mim
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Miggs
<EOS>
,
"
can
I
constrain
my
feelings
in
these
here
once
agin
united
moments
!
 
<EOS>
Ho
Mr
Warsen
,
here
's
blessedness
among
relations
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
Here
's
forgivenesses
of
injuries
,
here
's
amicablenesses
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
locksmith
looked
from
his
wife
to
Dolly
,
and
from
Dolly
to
Joe
,
and
from
Joe
to
Miggs
,
with
his
eyebrows
still
elevated
and
his
mouth
still
open
.
 
<EOS>
When
his
eyes
got
back
to
Miggs
,
they
rested
on
her
;
fascinated
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
think
,
"
cried
Miggs
with
hysterical
joy
,
"
that
Mr
Joe
,
and
dear
Miss
Dolly
,
has
raly
come
together
after
all
as
has
been
said
and
done
contrairy
!
 
<EOS>
To
see
them
two
a
-
settin
'
along
with
him
and
her
,
so
pleasant
and
in
all
respects
so
affable
and
mild
;
and
me
not
knowing
of
it
,
and
not
being
in
the
ways
to
make
no
preparations
for
their
teas
.
 
<EOS>
Ho
what
a
cutting
thing
it
is
,
and
yet
what
sweet
sensations
is
awoke
within
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
Either
in
clasping
her
hands
again
,
or
in
an
ecstasy
of
pious
joy
,
Miss
Miggs
clinked
her
pattens
after
the
manner
of
a
pair
of
cymbals
,
at
this
juncture
;
and
then
resumed
,
in
the
softest
accents
:
  
"
And
did
my
missis
think
---
ho
goodness
,
did
she
think
---
as
her
own
Miggs
,
which
supported
her
under
so
many
trials
,
and
understood
her
natur
"
when
them
as
intended
well
but
acted
rough
,
went
so
deep
into
her
feelings
---
did
she
think
as
her
own
Miggs
would
ever
leave
her
?
 
<EOS>
Did
she
think
as
Miggs
,
though
she
was
but
a
servant
,
and
knowed
that
servitudes
was
no
inheritances
,
would
forgit
that
she
was
the
humble
instruments
as
always
made
it
comfortable
between
them
two
when
they
fell
out
,
and
always
told
master
of
the
meekness
and
forgiveness
of
her
blessed
dispositions
!
 
<EOS>
Did
she
think
as
Miggs
had
no
attachments
!
 
<EOS>
Did
she
think
that
wages
was
her
only
object
!
"
  
<EOS>
To
none
of
these
interrogatories
,
whereof
every
one
was
more
pathetically
delivered
than
the
last
,
did
Mrs
Varden
answer
one
word
:
but
Miggs
,
not
at
all
abashed
by
this
circumstance
,
turned
to
the
small
boy
in
attendance
---
her
eldest
nephew
---
son
of
her
own
married
sister
---
born
in
Golden
Lion
Court
,
number
twenty
-
sivin
,
and
bred
in
the
very
shadow
of
the
second
bell
-
handle
on
the
right
-
hand
door
-
post
---
and
with
a
plentiful
use
of
her
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
addressed
herself
to
him
:
<EOS>
requesting
that
on
his
return
home
he
would
console
his
parents
for
the
loss
of
her
,
his
aunt
,
by
delivering
to
them
a
faithful
statement
of
his
having
left
her
in
the
bosom
of
that
family
,
with
which
,
as
his
aforesaid
parents
well
knew
,
her
best
affections
were
incorporated
;
that
he
would
remind
them
that
nothing
less
than
her
imperious
sense
of
duty
,
and
devoted
attachment
to
her
old
master
and
missis
,
likewise
Miss
Dolly
and
young
Mr
Joe
,
should
ever
have
induced
her
to
decline
that
pressing
invitation
which
they
,
his
parents
,
had
,
as
he
could
testify
,
given
her
,
to
lodge
and
board
with
them
,
free
of
all
cost
and
charge
,
for
evermore
;
<EOS>
lastly
,
that
he
would
help
her
with
her
box
upstairs
,
and
then
repair
straight
home
,
bearing
her
blessing
and
her
strong
injunctions
to
mingle
in
his
prayers
a
supplication
that
he
might
in
course
of
time
grow
up
a
locksmith
,
or
a
Mr
Joe
,
and
have
Mrs
Vardens
and
Miss
Dollys
for
his
relations
and
friends
.
  
<EOS>
Having
brought
this
admonition
to
an
end
---
upon
which
,
to
say
the
truth
,
the
young
gentleman
for
whose
benefit
it
was
designed
,
bestowed
little
or
no
heed
,
having
to
all
appearance
his
faculties
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
the
sweetmeats
,
---
Miss
Miggs
signified
to
the
company
in
general
that
they
were
not
to
be
uneasy
,
for
she
would
soon
return
;
and
,
with
her
nephew
's
aid
,
prepared
to
bear
her
wardrobe
up
the
staircase
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
said
the
locksmith
to
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
desire
this
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
desire
it
!
"
<EOS>
she
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
astonished
---
I
am
amazed
---
at
her
audacity
.
 
<EOS>
Let
her
leave
the
house
this
moment
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miggs
,
hearing
this
,
let
her
end
of
the
box
fall
heavily
to
the
floor
,
gave
a
very
loud
sniff
,
crossed
her
arms
,
screwed
down
the
corners
of
her
mouth
,
and
cried
,
in
an
ascending
scale
,
"
Ho
,
good
gracious
!
"
<EOS>
three
distinct
times
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
hear
what
your
mistress
says
,
my
love
,
"
remarked
the
locksmith
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
go
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
Stay
;
take
this
with
you
,
for
the
sake
of
old
service
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Miggs
clutched
the
bank
-
note
he
took
from
his
pocket
-
book
and
held
out
to
her
;
deposited
it
in
a
small
,
red
leather
purse
;
put
the
purse
in
her
pocket
(
displaying
,
as
she
did
so
,
a
considerable
portion
of
some
under
-
garment
,
made
of
flannel
,
and
more
black
cotton
stocking
than
is
commonly
seen
in
public
)
;
and
,
tossing
her
head
,
as
she
looked
at
Mrs
Varden
,
repeated
---
   
"
<EOS>
Ho
,
good
gracious
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
said
that
once
before
,
my
dear
,
"
observed
the
locksmith
.
  
<EOS>
"
Times
is
changed
,
is
they
,
mim
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Miggs
,
bridling
;
"
you
can
spare
me
now
,
can
you
?
 
<EOS>
You
can
keep
'em
down
without
me
?
 
<EOS>
You
're
not
in
wants
of
any
one
to
scold
,
or
throw
the
blame
upon
,
no
longer
,
an't
<EOS>
you
,
mim

<EOS>
I
'm
glad
to
find
you
've
grown
so
independent
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
joy
,
I
'm
sure
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
she
dropped
a
curtsey
,
and
keeping
her
head
erect
,
her
ear
towards
Mrs
Varden
,
and
her
eye
on
the
rest
of
the
company
,
as
she
alluded
to
them
in
her
remarks
,
proceeded
:
  
"
<EOS>
I
'm
quite
delighted
,
I
'm
sure
,
to
find
sich
independency
,
feeling
sorry
though
,
at
the
same
time
,
mim
,
that
you
should
have
been
forced
into
submissions
when
you
could
n't
help
yourself
---
he
he
he
!
<EOS>
It
must
be
great
vexations
,
"
specially
considering
how
ill
you
always
spoke
of
Mr
Joe
---
to
have
him
for
a
son
-
in
-
law
at
last
;
and
I
wonder
Miss
Dolly
can
put
up
with
him
,
either
,
after
being
off
and
on
for
so
many
years
with
a
coachmaker
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
HAVE
heerd
say
,
that
the
coachmaker
thought
twice
about
it
---
he
he
he
!
<EOS>
---
and
that
he
told
a
young
man
as
was
a
frind
of
his
,
that
he
hoped
he
knowed
better
than
to
be
drawed
into
that
;
though
she
and
all
the
family
<EOS>
DID
pull
uncommon
strong
!
"
  
<EOS>
Here
she
paused
for
a
reply
,
and
receiving
none
,
went
on
as
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
HAVE
heerd
say
,
mim
,
that
the
illnesses
of
some
ladies
was
all
pretensions
,
and
that
they
could
faint
away
,
stone
dead
,
whenever
they
had
the
inclinations
so
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
Of
course
I
never
see
sich
cases
with
my
own
eyes
---
<EOS>
ho
no

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
Nor

neither

ho
no

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
I
HAVE
heerd
the
neighbours
make
remark
as
some
one
as
they
was
acquainted
with
<EOS>
,
was
a
poor
good
-
natur'd
mean
-
spirited
creetur
,
as
went
out
fishing
for
a
wife
one
day
,
and
caught
a
Tartar
.
 
<EOS>
Of
course
I
never
to
my
knowledge
see
the
poor
person
himself

<EOS>
Nor
did
you
neither

no

No

Ho

"
  
<EOS>
Again
Miggs
paused
for
a
reply
;
and
none
being
offered
,
was
so
oppressed
with
teeming
spite
and
spleen
,
that
she
seemed
like
to
burst
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
glad
Miss
Dolly
can
laugh
,
"
cried
Miggs
with
a
feeble
titter
.
<EOS>
"
I
like
to
see
folks
a
-
laughing
---
so
do
you
,

do
n't
you

<EOS>
You

always
glad

<EOS>
And
you
always
did
your
best
to
keep

cheerful

did

<EOS>
Though
there
an't
such
a
great
deal
to
laugh
at
now
either

is
there

<EOS>
It
an't
<EOS>
so
much
of
a
catch
,
after
looking
out
so
sharp
ever
since
she
was
a
little
chit
,
and
costing
such
a
deal
in
dress
and
show
,
to
get
a
poor
,
common
soldier
,
with
one
arm
,
is
it
,
mim
?
<EOS>
He
he
!
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
have
a
husband
with
one
arm
,
anyways
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
two
arms
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
two
arms
,
if
it
was
me
,
though
instead
of
hands
<EOS>
they
'd
only
got
hooks
at
the
end
,
like
our
dustman
!
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Miggs
was
about
to
add
,
and
had
,
indeed
,
begun
to
add
,
that
,
taking
them
in
the
abstract
,
dustmen
were
far
more
eligible
matches
than
soldiers
,
though
,
to
be
sure
,
when
people
were
past
choosing
they
must
take
the
best
they
could
get
,
and
think
themselves
well
off
too
;
but
her
vexation
and
chagrin
being
of
that
internally
bitter
sort
which
finds
no
relief
in
words
,
and
is
aggravated
to
madness
by
want
of
contradiction
,
she
could
hold
out
no
longer
,
and
burst
into
a
storm
of
sobs
and
tears
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
extremity
she
fell
on
the
unlucky
nephew
,
tooth
and
nail
,
and
plucking
a
handful
of
hair
from
his
head
,
demanded
to
know
how
long
she
was
to
stand
there
to
be
insulted
,
and
whether
or
no
he
meant
to
help
her
to
carry
out
the
box
again
,
and
if
he
took
a
pleasure
in
hearing
his
family
reviled
:
with
other
inquiries
of
that
nature
;
at
which
disgrace
and
provocation
,
the
small
boy
,
who
had
been
all
this
time
gradually
lashed
into
rebellion
by
the
sight
of
unattainable
pastry
,
walked
off
indignant
,
leaving
his
aunt
and
the
box
to
follow
at
their
leisure
.
 
<EOS>
Somehow
or
other
,
by
dint
of
pushing
and
pulling
,
they
did
attain
the
street
at
last
;
where
Miss
Miggs
,
all
blowzed
with
the
exertion
of
getting
there
,
and
with
her
sobs
and
tears
,
sat
down
upon
her
property
to
rest
and
grieve
,
until
she
could
ensnare
some
other
youth
to
help
her
home
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
thing
to
laugh
at
,
Martha
,
not
to
care
for
,
"
whispered
the
locksmith
,
as
he
followed
his
wife
to
the
window
,
and
good
-
humouredly
dried
her
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
does
it
matter
?
 
<EOS>
You
had
seen
your
fault
before

<EOS>
Come

<EOS>
Bring
up
Toby
again
,
my

sing
us
a
song

and
we
'll
be
all
the
merrier
for
this
interruption

Chapter
81
    
<EOS>
Another
month
had
passed
,
and
the
end
of
August
had
nearly
come
,
when
Mr
Haredale
stood
alone
in
the
mail
-
coach
office
at
Bristol
.
<EOS>
Although
but
a
few
weeks
had
intervened
since
his
conversation
with
Edward
Chester
and
his
niece
,
in
the
locksmith
's
house
,
and
he
had
made
no
change
,
in
the
mean
time
,
in
his
accustomed
style
of
dress
,
his
appearance
was
greatly
altered
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
much
older
,
and
more
care
-
worn
.
 
<EOS>
Agitation
and
anxiety
of
mind
scatter
wrinkles
and
grey
hairs
with
no
unsparing
hand
;
but
deeper
traces
follow
on
the
silent
uprooting
of
old
habits
,
and
severing
of
dear
,
familiar
ties
.
 
<EOS>
The
affections
may
not
be
so
easily
wounded
as
the
passions
,
but
their
hurts
are
deeper
,
and
more
lasting
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
now
a
solitary
man
,
and
the
heart
within
him
was
dreary
and
lonesome
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
not
the
less
alone
for
having
spent
so
many
years
in
seclusion
and
retirement
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
no
better
preparation
than
a
round
of
social
cheerfulness
:
perhaps
it
even
increased
the
keenness
of
his
sensibility
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
so
dependent
upon
her
for
companionship
and
love
;
she
had
come
to
be
so
much
a
part
and
parcel
of
his
existence
;
they
had
had
so
many
cares
and
thoughts
in
common
,
which
no
one
else
had
shared
;
that
losing
her
was
beginning
life
anew
,
and
being
required
to
summon
up
the
hope
and
elasticity
of
youth
,
amid
the
doubts
,
distrusts
,
and
weakened
energies
of
age
.
  
<EOS>
The
effort
he
had
made
to
part
from
her
with
seeming
cheerfulness
and
hope
---
and
they
had
parted
only
yesterday
---
left
him
the
more
depressed
.
 
<EOS>
With
these
feelings
,
he
was
about
to
revisit
London
for
the
last
time
,
and
look
once
more
upon
the
walls
of
their
old
home
,
before
turning
his
back
upon
it
,
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
The
journey
was
a
very
different
one
,
in
those
days
,
from
what
the
present
generation
find
it
;
but
it
came
to
an
end
,
as
the
longest
journey
will
,
and
he
stood
again
in
the
streets
of
the
metropolis
.
<EOS>
He
lay
at
the
inn
where
the
coach
stopped
,
and
resolved
,
before
he
went
to
bed
,
that
he
would
make
his
arrival
known
to
no
one
;
would
spend
but
another
night
in
London
;
and
would
spare
himself
the
pang
of
parting
,
even
with
the
honest
locksmith
.
  
<EOS>
Such
conditions
of
the
mind
as
that
to
which
he
was
a
prey
when
he
lay
down
to
rest
,
are
favourable
to
the
growth
of
disordered
fancies
,
and
uneasy
visions
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
this
,
even
in
the
horror
with
which
he
started
from
his
first
sleep
,
and
threw
up
the
window
to
dispel
it
by
the
presence
of
some
object
,
beyond
the
room
,
which
had
not
been
,
as
it
were
,
the
witness
of
his
dream
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
a
new
terror
of
the
night
;
it
had
been
present
to
him
before
,
in
many
shapes
;
it
had
haunted
him
in
bygone
times
,
and
visited
his
pillow
again
and
again
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
had
been
but
an
ugly
object
,
a
childish
spectre
,
haunting
his
sleep
,
its
return
,
in
its
old
form
,
might
have
awakened
a
momentary
sensation
of
fear
,
which
,
almost
in
the
act
of
waking
,
would
have
passed
away
.
 
<EOS>
This
disquiet
,
however
,
lingered
about
him
,
and
would
yield
to
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
closed
his
eyes
again
,
he
felt
it
hovering
near
;
as
he
slowly
sunk
into
a
slumber
,
he
was
conscious
of
its
gathering
strength
and
purpose
,
and
gradually
assuming
its
recent
shape
;
when
he
sprang
up
from
his
bed
,
the
same
phantom
vanished
from
his
heated
brain
,
and
left
him
filled
with
a
dread
against
which
reason
and
waking
thought
were
powerless
.
  
<EOS>
The
sun
was
up
,
before
he
could
shake
it
off
.
 
<EOS>
He
rose
late
,
but
not
refreshed
,
and
remained
within
doors
all
that
day
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
fancy
for
paying
his
last
visit
to
the
old
spot
in
the
evening
,
for
he
had
been
accustomed
to
walk
there
at
that
season
,
and
desired
to
see
it
under
the
aspect
that
was
most
familiar
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
At
such
an
hour
as
would
afford
him
time
to
reach
it
a
little
before
sunset
,
he
left
the
inn
,
and
turned
into
the
busy
street
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
not
gone
far
,
and
was
thoughtfully
making
his
way
among
the
noisy
crowd
,
when
he
felt
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
,
turning
,
recognised
one
of
the
waiters
from
the
inn
,
who
begged
his
pardon
,
but
he
had
left
his
sword
behind
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
have
you
brought
it
to
me
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
stretching
out
his
hand
,
and
yet
not
taking
it
from
the
man
,
but
looking
at
him
in
a
disturbed
and
agitated
manner
.
  
<EOS>
The
man
was
sorry
to
have
disobliged
him
,
and
would
carry
it
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
The
gentleman
had
said
that
he
was
going
a
little
way
into
the
country
,
and
that
he
might
not
return
until
late
.
 
<EOS>
The
roads
were
not
very
safe
for
single
travellers
after
dark
;
and
,
since
the
riots
,
gentlemen
had
been
more
careful
than
ever
,
not
to
trust
themselves
unarmed
in
lonely
places
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
thought
you
were
a
stranger
,
sir
,
"
he
added
,
"
and
that
you
might
believe
our
roads
to
be
better
than
they
are
;
but
perhaps
you
know
them
well
,
and
carry
fire
-
arms
---
"
  
He
took
the
sword
,
and
putting
it
up
at
his
side
,
thanked
the
man
,
and
resumed
his
walk
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
long
remembered
that
he
did
this
in
a
manner
so
strange
,
and
with
such
a
trembling
hand
,
that
the
messenger
stood
looking
after
his
retreating
figure
,
doubtful
whether
he
ought
not
to
follow
,
and
watch
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
long
remembered
that
he
had
been
heard
pacing
his
bedroom
in
the
dead
of
the
night
;
that
the
attendants
had
mentioned
to
each
other
in
the
morning
,
how
fevered
and
how
pale
he
looked
;
and
that
when
this
man
went
back
to
the
inn
,
he
told
a
fellow
-
servant
that
what
he
had
observed
in
this
short
interview
lay
very
heavy
on
his
mind
,
and
that
he
feared
the
gentleman
intended
to
destroy
himself
,
and
would
never
come
back
alive
.
  
<EOS>
With
a
half
-
consciousness
that
his
manner
had
attracted
the
man
's
attention
(
remembering
the
expression
of
his
face
when
they
parted
)
,
Mr
Haredale
quickened
his
steps
;
and
arriving
at
a
stand
of
coaches
,
bargained
with
the
driver
of
the
best
to
carry
him
so
far
on
his
road
as
the
point
where
the
footway
struck
across
the
fields
,
and
to
await
his
return
at
a
house
of
entertainment
which
was
within
a
stone's
-
throw
of
that
place
.
 
<EOS>
Arriving
there
in
due
course
,
he
alighted
and
pursued
his
way
on
foot
.
  
<EOS>
He
passed
so
near
the
Maypole
,
that
he
could
see
its
smoke
rising
from
among
the
trees
,
while
a
flock
of
pigeons
---
some
of
its
old
inhabitants
,
doubtless
---
sailed
gaily
home
to
roost
,
between
him
and
the
unclouded
sky
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
old
house
will
brighten
up
now
,
"
he
said
,
as
he
looked
towards
it
,
"
and
there
will
be
a
merry
fireside
beneath
its
ivied
roof
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
some
comfort
to
know
that
everything
will
not
be
blighted
hereabouts
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
glad
to
have
one
picture
of
life
and
cheerfulness
to
turn
to
,
in
my
mind
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
resumed
his
walk
,
and
bent
his
steps
towards
the
Warren
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
clear
,
calm
,
silent
evening
,
with
hardly
a
breath
of
wind
to
stir
the
leaves
,
or
any
sound
to
break
the
stillness
of
the
time
,
but
drowsy
sheep
-
bells
tinkling
in
the
distance
,
and
,
at
intervals
,
the
far
-
off
lowing
of
cattle
,
or
bark
of
village
dogs
.
 
<EOS>
The
sky
was
radiant
with
the
softened
glory
of
sunset
;
and
on
the
earth
,
and
in
the
air
,
a
deep
repose
prevailed
.
 
<EOS>
At
such
an
hour
,
he
arrived
at
the
deserted
mansion
which
had
been
his
home
so
long
,
and
looked
for
the
last
time
upon
its
blackened
walls
.
  
<EOS>
The
ashes
of
the
commonest
fire
are
melancholy
things
,
for
in
them
there
is
an
image
of
death
and
ruin
,
---
of
something
that
has
been
bright
,
and
is
but
dull
,
cold
,
dreary
dust
,
---
with
which
our
nature
forces
us
to
sympathise
.
 
<EOS>
How
much
more
sad
the
crumbled
embers
of
a
home
:
<EOS>
the
casting
down
of
that
great
altar
,
where
the
worst
among
us
sometimes
perform
the
worship
of
the
heart
;
and
where
the
best
have
offered
up
such
sacrifices
,
and
done
such
deeds
of
heroism
,
as
,
chronicled
,
would
put
the
proudest
temples
of
old
Time
,
with
all
their
vaunting
annals
,
to
the
blush
!
  
<EOS>
He
roused
himself
from
a
long
train
of
meditation
,
and
walked
slowly
round
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
by
this
time
almost
dark
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
nearly
made
the
circuit
of
the
building
,
when
he
uttered
a
half
-
suppressed
exclamation
,
started
,
and
stood
still
.
 
<EOS>
Reclining
,
in
an
easy
attitude
,
with
his
back
against
a
tree
,
and
contemplating
the
ruin
with
an
expression
of
pleasure
,
---
a
pleasure
<EOS>
so
keen
that
it
overcame
his
habitual
indolence
and
command
of
feature
,
and
displayed
itself
utterly
free
from
all
restraint
or
reserve
,
---
before
him
,
on
his
own
ground
,
and
triumphing
then
,
as
he
had
triumphed
in
every
misfortune
and
disappointment
of
his
life
,
stood
the
man
whose
presence
,
of
all
mankind
,
in
any
place
,
and
least
of
all
in
that
,
he
could
the
least
endure
.
  
<EOS>
Although
his
blood
so
rose
against
this
man
,
and
his
wrath
so
stirred
within
him
,
that
he
could
have
struck
him
dead
,
he
put
such
fierce
constraint
upon
himself
that
he
passed
him
without
a
word
or
look
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
he
would
have
gone
on
,
and
not
turned
,
though
to
resist
the
Devil
who
poured
such
hot
temptation
in
his
brain
,
required
an
effort
scarcely
to
be
achieved
,
if
this
man
had
not
himself
summoned
him
to
stop
:
and
that
,
with
an
assumed
compassion
in
his
voice
which
drove
him
well
-
nigh
mad
,
and
in
an
instant
routed
all
the
self
-
command
it
had
been
anguish
---
acute
,
poignant
anguish
---
to
sustain
.
  
<EOS>
All
consideration
,
reflection
,
mercy
,
forbearance
;
everything
by
which
a
goaded
man
can
curb
his
rage
and
passion
;
fled
from
him
as
he
turned
back
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
he
said
,
slowly
and
quite
calmly
---
far
more
calmly
than
he
had
ever
spoken
to
him
before
:
  
<EOS>
"
Why
have
you
called
to
me
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
remark
,
"
said
Sir
John
Chester
with
his
wonted
composure
,
"
what
an
odd
chance
it
is
,
that
we
should
meet
here
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
IS
a
strange
chance
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Strange
?
 
<EOS>
The
most
remarkable
and
singular
thing
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
ride
in
the
evening
;
I
have
not
done
so
for
years
.
 
<EOS>
The
whim
seized
me
,
quite
unaccountably
,
in
the
middle
of
last
night
.
<EOS>
---
How
very
picturesque
this
is
!
"
<EOS>
---
He
pointed
,
as
he
spoke
,
to
the
dismantled
house
,
and
raised
his
glass
to
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
praise
your
own
work
very
freely
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
John
let
fall
his
glass
;
inclined
his
face
towards
him
with
an
air
of
the
most
courteous
inquiry
;
and
slightly
shook
his
head
as
though
he
were
remarking
to
himself
,
"
I
fear
this
animal
is
going
mad
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
you
praise
your
own
work
very
freely
,
"
repeated
Mr
Haredale
.
  
<EOS>
"
Work
!
"
echoed
Sir
John
,
looking
smilingly
round
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mine
!
---
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
,
I
really
beg
your
pardon
---
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
see
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
"
those
walls
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
those
tottering
gables
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
on
every
side
where
fire
and
smoke
have
raged
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
the
destruction
that
has
been
wanton
here
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
good
friend
,
"
returned
the
knight
,
gently
checking
his
impatience
with
his
hand
,
"
of
course
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
everything
you
speak
of
,
when
you
stand
aside
,
and
do
not
interpose
yourself
between
the
view
and
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
very
sorry
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
had
not
had
the
pleasure
to
meet
you
here
,
I
think
I
should
have
written
to
tell
you
so
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
do
n't
bear
it
as
well
as
I
had
expected
---
 
<EOS>
excuse
me
---
<EOS>
no
,
you
do
n't
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
pulled
out
his
snuff
-
box
,
and
addressing
him
with
the
superior
air
of
a
man
who
,
by
reason
of
his
higher
nature
,
has
a
right
to
read
a
moral
lesson
to
another
,
continued
:
  
"
<EOS>
For
you
are
a
philosopher
,
you
know
---
one
of
that
stern
and
rigid
school
who
are
far
above
the
weaknesses
of
mankind
in
general
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
removed
,
a
long
way
,
from
the
frailties
of
the
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
You
contemplate
them
from
a
height
,
and
rail
at
them
with
a
most
impressive
bitterness
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
heard
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
---
"
<EOS>
And
shall
again
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
returned
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
we
walk
as
we
talk
?
 
<EOS>
The
damp
falls
rather
heavily
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
---
as
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
grieve
to
say
that
I
can
spare
you
only
a
very
few
moments
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
would
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
,
"
you
had
spared
me
none
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
,
with
all
my
soul
,
you
had
been
in
Paradise
(
if
such
a
monstrous
lie
could
be
enacted
)
,
rather
than
here
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
returned
the
other
---
"
really
---
you
do
yourself
injustice
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
a
rough
companion
,
but
I
would
not
go
so
far
to
avoid
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Listen
to
me
,
"
said
Mr
Haredale
.
 
<EOS>
"
Listen
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
While
you
rail
?
"
inquired
Sir
John
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
While
I
deliver
your
infamy
.
 
<EOS>
You
urged
and
stimulated
to
do
your
work
a
fit
agent
,
but
one
who
in
his
nature
---
in
the
very
essence
of
his
being
---
is
a
traitor
,
and
who
has
been
false
to
you
(
despite
the
sympathy
you
two
should
have
together
)
as
he
has
been
to
all
others
.
 
<EOS>
With
hints
,
and
looks
,
and
crafty
words
,
which
told
again
are
nothing
,
you
set
on
Gashford
to
this
work
---
this
work
before
us
now
.
 
<EOS>
With
these
same
hints
,
and
looks
,
and
crafty
words
,
which
told
again
are
nothing
,
you
urged
him
on
to
gratify
the
deadly
hate
he
owes
me
<EOS>
---
I
have
earned
it
,
I
thank
Heaven
---
by
the
abduction
and
dishonour
of
my
niece
.
 
<EOS>
You
did
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
denial
in
your
looks
,
"
he
cried
,
abruptly
pointing
in
his
face
,
and
stepping
back
,
"
and
denial
is
a
lie
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
his
hand
upon
his
sword
;
but
the
knight
,
with
a
contemptuous
smile
,
replied
to
him
as
coldly
as
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
take
notice
,
sir
---
if
you
can
discriminate
sufficiently
---
 
that
I
have
taken
the
trouble
to
deny
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Your
discernment
is
hardly
fine
enough
for
the
perusal
of
faces
,
not
of
a
kind
as
coarse
as
your
speech
;
nor
has
it
ever
been
,
that
I
remember
;
or
,
in
one
face
that
I
could
name
,
you
would
have
read
indifference
,
not
to
say
disgust
,
somewhat
sooner
than
you
did
.
 
<EOS>
I
speak
of
a
long
time
ago
,
---
<EOS>
but
you
understand
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Disguise
it
as
you
will
,
you
mean
denial
.
 
<EOS>
Denial
explicit
or
reserved
,
expressed
or
left
to
be
inferred
,
is
still
a
lie
.
 
<EOS>
You
say
you
do
n't
deny
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
admit
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
yourself
,
"
returned
Sir
John
,
suffering
the
current
of
his
speech
to
flow
as
smoothly
as
if
it
had
been
stemmed
by
no
one
word
of
interruption
,
"
publicly
proclaimed
the
character
of
the
gentleman
in
question
(
I
think
it
was
in
Westminster
Hall
)
in
terms
which
relieve
me
from
the
necessity
of
making
any
further
allusion
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
have
been
warranted
;
you
may
not
have
been
;
I
ca
n't
say
.
 
<EOS>
Assuming
the
gentleman
to
be
what
you
described
,
and
to
have
made
to
you
or
any
other
person
any
statements
that
may
have
happened
to
suggest
themselves
to
him
,
for
the
sake
of
his
own
security
,
or
for
the
sake
of
money
,
or
for
his
own
amusement
,
or
for
any
other
consideration
,
---
I
have
nothing
to
say
of
him
,
except
that
his
extremely
degrading
situation
appears
to
me
to
be
shared
with
his
employers
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
so
very
plain
yourself
,
that
you
will
excuse
a
little
freedom
in
me
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Attend
to
me
again
,
Sir
John
<EOS>
but
once
,
"
cried
Mr
Haredale
;
"
in
your
every
look
,
and
word
,
and
gesture
,
you
tell
me
this
was
not
your
act
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
that
it
was
,
and
that
you
tampered
with
the
man
I
speak
of
,
and
with
your
wretched
son
(
whom
God
forgive
!
)
<EOS>
to
do
this
deed
.
 
<EOS>
You
talk
of
degradation
and
character
.
 
<EOS>
You
told
me
once
that
you
had
purchased
the
absence
of
the
poor
idiot
and
his
mother
,
when
(
as
I
have
discovered
since
,
and
then
suspected
)
<EOS>
you
had
gone
to
tempt
them
,
and
had
found
them
flown
.
 
<EOS>
To
you
I
traced
the
insinuation
that
I
alone
reaped
any
harvest
from
my
brother
's
death
;
and
all
the
foul
attacks
and
whispered
calumnies
that
followed
in
its
train
.
 
<EOS>
In
every
action
of
my
life
,
from
that
first
hope
which
you
converted
into
grief
and
desolation
,
you
have
stood
,
like
an
adverse
fate
,
between
me
and
peace
.
 
<EOS>
In
all
,
you
have
ever
been
the
same
cold
-
blooded
,
hollow
,
false
,
unworthy
villain
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
second
time
,
and
for
the
last
,
I
cast
these
charges
in
your
teeth
,
and
spurn
you
from
me
as
I
would
a
faithless
dog
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
he
raised
his
arm
,
and
struck
him
on
the
breast
so
that
he
staggered
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
John
,
the
instant
he
recovered
,
drew
his
sword
,
threw
away
the
scabbard
and
his
hat
,
and
running
on
his
adversary
<EOS>
made
a
desperate
lunge
at
his
heart
,
<EOS>
which
,
but
that
his
guard
was
quick
and
true
,
would
have
stretched
him
dead
upon
the
grass
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
act
of
striking
him
,
the
torrent
of
his
opponent
's
rage
had
reached
a
stop
.
 
<EOS>
He
parried
his
rapid
thrusts
,
without
returning
them
,
and
called
to
him
,
with
a
frantic
kind
of
terror
in
his
face
,
to
keep
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
to
-
night
!
<EOS>
not
to
-
night
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
God
's
name
,
not
tonight
!
"
  
<EOS>
Seeing
that
he
lowered
his
weapon
,
and
that
he
would
not
thrust
in
turn
,
Sir
John
lowered
his
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
to
-
night
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
his
adversary
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
warned
in
time
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
told
me
---
it
must
have
been
in
a
sort
of
inspiration
---
"
said
Sir
John
,
quite
deliberately
,
though
now
he
dropped
his
mask
,
and
showed
his
hatred
in
his
face
,
"
that
this
was
the
last
time
.
 
<EOS>
Be
assured
it
is
!
 
<EOS>
Did
you
believe
our
last
meeting
was
forgotten
?
<EOS>
Did
you
believe
that
your
every
word
and
look
was
not
to
be
accounted
for
,
and
was
not
well
remembered
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
believe
that
I
have
waited
your
time
,
or
you
mine
?
 
<EOS>
What
kind
of
man
is
he
who
entered
,
with
all
his
sickening
ca
nt
of
honesty
and
truth
,
into
a
bond
with
me
to
prevent
a
marriage
he
affected
to
dislike
,
and
when
I
had
redeemed
my
part
to
the
spirit
and
the
letter
,
skulked
from
his
,
and
brought
the
match
about
in
his
own
time
,
to
rid
himself
of
a
burden
he
had
grown
tired
of
,
and
cast
a
spurious
lustre
on
his
house
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
acted
,
"
cried
Mr
Haredale
,
"
with
honour
and
in
good
faith
.
<EOS>
I
do
so
now
.
 
<EOS>
Do
not
force
me
to
renew
this
duel
to
-
night
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
said
my
"
wretched
"
son
,
I
think
?
"
said
Sir
John
,
with
a
smile
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
fool
!
 
<EOS>
The
dupe
of
such
a
shallow
knave
---
trapped
into
marriage
by
such
an
uncle
and
by
such
a
niece
---
he
well
deserves
your
pity
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
is
no
longer
a
son
of
mine
<EOS>
:
you
are
welcome
to
the
prize
your
craft
has
made
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Once
more
,
"
cried
his
opponent
,
wildly
stamping
on
the
ground
,
"
although
you
tear
me
from
my
better
angel
,
I
implore
you
not
to
come
within
the
reach
of
my
sword
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
why
were
you
here
at
all
!
 
<EOS>
Why
have
we
met
!
 
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
would
have
cast
us
far
apart
for
ever
!

<EOS>
"
That
being
the
case
,
"
returned
Sir
John
,
without
the
least
emotion
,
"
it
is
very
fortunate
<EOS>
we
have
met
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
Haredale
,
I
have
always
despised
you
,
as
you
know
,
but
I
have
given
you
credit
for
a
species
of
brute
courage
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
honour
of
my
judgment
,
which
I
had
thought
a
good
one
,
I
am
sorry
to
find
you
a
coward
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Not
another
word
was
spoken
on
either
side
.
 
<EOS>
They
crossed
swords
,
though
it
was
now
quite
dusk
,
and
attacked
each
other
fiercely
.
<EOS>
They
were
well
matched
,
and
each
was
thoroughly
skilled
in
the
management
of
his
weapon
.
  
<EOS>
After
a
few
seconds
they
grew
hotter
and
more
furious
,
and
pressing
on
each
other
inflicted
and
received
several
slight
wounds
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
directly
after
receiving
one
of
these
in
his
arm
,
that
Mr
Haredale
,
making
a
keener
thrust
as
he
felt
the
warm
blood
spirting
out
,
plunged
his
sword
through
his
opponent
's
body
to
the
hilt
.
  
<EOS>
Their
eyes
met
,
and
were
on
each
other
as
he
drew
it
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
put
his
arm
about
the
dying
man
,
who
repulsed
him
,
feebly
,
and
dropped
upon
the
turf
.
 
<EOS>
Raising
himself
upon
his
hands
,
he
gazed
at
him
for
an
instant
,
with
scorn
and
hatred
in
his
look
;
but
,
seeming
to
remember
,
even
then
,
that
this
expression
would
distort
his
features
after
death
,
he
tried
to
smile
,
and
,
faintly
moving
his
right
hand
,
as
if
to
hide
his
bloody
linen
in
his
vest
,
fell
back
dead
---
the
phantom
of
last
night
.
   
<EOS>
Chapter
the
Last
 
<EOS>
A
parting
glance
at
such
of
the
actors
in
this
little
history
as
it
has
not
,
in
the
course
of
its
events
,
dismissed
,
will
bring
it
to
an
end
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Haredale
fled
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
Before
pursuit
could
be
begun
,
indeed
before
Sir
John
was
traced
or
missed
,
he
had
left
the
kingdom
.
<EOS>
Repairing
straight
to
a
religious
establishment
,
known
throughout
Europe
for
the
rigour
and
severity
of
its
discipline
,
and
for
the
merciless
penitence
it
exacted
from
those
who
sought
its
shelter
as
a
refuge
from
the
world
,
he
took
the
vows
which
thenceforth
shut
him
out
from
nature
and
his
kind
,
and
after
a
few
remorseful
years
was
buried
in
its
gloomy
cloisters
.
  
<EOS>
Two
days
elapsed
before
the
body
of
Sir
John
was
found
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
it
was
recognised
and
carried
home
,
the
faithful
valet
,
true
to
his
master
's
creed
,
eloped
with
all
the
cash
and
movables
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
,
and
started
as
a
finished
gentleman
upon
his
own
account
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
career
he
met
with
great
success
,
and
would
certainly
have
married
an
heiress
in
the
end
,
but
for
an
unlucky
check
which
led
to
his
premature
decease
.
 
<EOS>
He
sank
under
a
contagious
disorder
,
very
prevalent
at
that
time
,
and
vulgarly
termed
the
jail
fever
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
George
Gordon
,
remaining
in
his
prison
in
the
Tower
until
Monday
the
fifth
of
February
in
the
following
year
,
was
on
that
day
solemnly
tried
at
Westminster
for
High
Treason
.
 
<EOS>
Of
this
crime
he
was
,
after
a
patient
investigation
,
declared
Not
Guilty
;
upon
the
ground
that
there
was
no
proof
of
his
having
called
the
multitude
together
with
any
traitorous
or
unlawful
intentions
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
so
many
people
were
there
,
still
,
to
whom
those
riots
taught
no
lesson
of
reproof
or
moderation
,
that
a
public
subscription
was
set
on
foot
in
Scotland
to
defray
the
cost
of
his
defence
.
  
<EOS>
For
seven
years
afterwards
he
remained
,
at
the
strong
intercession
of
his
friends
,
comparatively
quiet
;
saving
that
he
,
every
now
and
then
,
took
occasion
to
display
his
zeal
for
the
Protestant
faith
in
some
extravagant
proceeding
which
was
the
delight
of
its
enemies
;
and
saving
,
besides
,
that
he
was
formally
excommunicated
by
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
,
for
refusing
to
appear
as
a
witness
in
the
Ecclesiastical
Court
when
cited
for
that
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
year
1788
he
was
stimulated
by
some
new
insanity
to
write
and
publish
an
injurious
pamphlet
,
reflecting
on
the
Queen
of
France
,
in
very
violent
terms
.
 
<EOS>
Being
indicted
for
the
libel
,
and
(
after
various
strange
demonstrations
in
court
)
found
guilty
,
he
fled
into
Holland
in
place
of
appearing
to
receive
sentence
:
from
whence
,
as
the
quiet
burgomasters
of
Amsterdam
had
no
relish
for
his
company
,
he
was
sent
home
again
with
all
speed
.
 
<EOS>
Arriving
in
the
month
of
July
at
Harwich
,
and
going
thence
to
Birmingham
,
he
made
in
the
latter
place
,
in
August
,
a
public
profession
of
the
Jewish
religion
;
and
figured
there
as
a
Jew
until
he
was
arrested
,
and
brought
back
to
London
to
receive
the
sentence
he
had
evaded
.
 
<EOS>
By
virtue
of
this
sentence
he
was
,
in
the
month
of
December
,
cast
into
Newgate
for
five
years
and
ten
months
,
and
required
besides
to
pay
a
large
fine
,
and
to
furnish
heavy
securities
for
his
future
good
behaviour
.
  
<EOS>
After
addressing
,
in
the
midsummer
of
the
following
year
,
an
appeal
to
the
commiseration
of
the
National
Assembly
of
France
,
which
the
English
minister
refused
to
sanction
,
he
composed
himself
to
undergo
his
full
term
of
punishment
;
and
suffering
his
beard
to
grow
nearly
to
his
waist
,
and
conforming
in
all
respects
to
the
ceremonies
of
his
new
religion
,
he
applied
himself
to
the
study
of
history
,
and
occasionally
to
the
art
of
painting
,
in
which
,
in
his
younger
days
,
he
had
shown
some
skill
.
 
<EOS>
Deserted
by
his
former
friends
,
and
treated
in
all
respects
like
the
worst
criminal
in
the
jail
,
he
lingered
on
,
quite
cheerful
and
resigned
,
until
the
1st
of
November
1793
,
when
he
died
in
his
cell
,
being
then
only
three
-
and
-
forty
years
of
age
.
  
<EOS>
Many
men
with
fewer
sympathies
for
the
distressed
and
needy
,
with
less
abilities
and
harder
hearts
,
have
made
a
shining
figure
and
left
a
brilliant
fame
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
his
mourners
.
 
<EOS>
The
prisoners
bemoaned
his
loss
,
and
missed
him
;
for
though
his
means
were
not
large
,
his
charity
was
great
,
and
in
bestowing
alms
among
them
he
considered
the
necessities
of
all
alike
,
and
knew
no
distinction
of
sect
or
creed
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
wise
men
in
the
highways
of
the
world
who
may
learn
something
,
even
from
this
poor
crazy
lord
who
died
in
Newgate
.
  
<EOS>
To
the
last
,
he
was
truly
served
by
bluff
John
Grueby
.
 
<EOS>
John
was
at
his
side
before
he
had
been
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
in
the
Tower
,
and
never
left
him
until
he
died
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
one
other
constant
attendant
,
in
the
person
of
a
beautiful
Jewish
girl
;
who
attached
herself
to
him
from
feelings
half
religious
,
half
romantic
,
but
<EOS>
whose
virtuous
and
disinterested
character
appears
to
have
been
beyond
the
censure
even
of
the
most
censorious
.
  
<EOS>
Gashford
deserted
him
,
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
He
subsisted
for
a
time
upon
his
traffic
in
his
master
's
secrets
;
and
,
this
trade
failing
when
the
stock
was
quite
exhausted
,
procured
an
appointment
in
the
honourable
corps
of
spies
and
eavesdroppers
employed
by
the
government
.
 
<EOS>
As
one
of
these
wretched
underlings
,
he
did
his
drudgery
,
sometimes
abroad
,
sometimes
at
home
,
and
long
endured
the
various
miseries
of
such
a
station
.
 
<EOS>
Ten
or
a
dozen
years
ago
---
not
more
---
a
meagre
,
wan
old
man
,
diseased
and
miserably
poor
,
was
found
dead
in
his
bed
at
an
obscure
inn
in
the
Borough
,
where
he
was
quite
unknown
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
taken
poison
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
clue
to
his
name
;
but
it
was
discovered
from
certain
entries
in
a
pocket
-
book
he
carried
,
that
he
had
been
secretary
to
Lord
George
Gordon
in
the
time
of
the
famous
riots
.
  
<EOS>
Many
months
after
the
re
-
establishment
of
peace
and
order
,
and
even
when
it
had
ceased
to
be
the
town
-
talk
,
that
every
military
officer
,
kept
at
free
quarters
by
the
City
during
the
late
alarms
,
had
cost
for
his
board
and
lodging
four
pounds
four
per
day
,
and
every
private
soldier
two
and
twopence
halfpenny
;
many
months
after
even
this
engrossing
topic
was
forgotten
,
and
the
United
Bulldogs
were
to
a
man
all
killed
,
imprisoned
,
or
transported
,
Mr
Simon
Tappertit
,
being
removed
from
a
hospital
to
prison
,
and
thence
to
his
place
of
trial
,
was
discharged
by
proclamation
,
on
two
wooden
legs
.
 
<EOS>
Shorn
of
his
graceful
limbs
,
and
brought
down
from
his
high
estate
to
circumstances
of
utter
destitution
,
and
the
deepest
misery
,
he
made
shift
to
stump
back
to
his
old
master
,
and
beg
for
some
relief
.
 
<EOS>
By
the
locksmith
's
advice
and
aid
,
he
was
established
in
business
as
a
shoeblack
,
and
opened
shop
under
an
archway
near
the
Horse
Guards
.
 
<EOS>
This
being
a
central
quarter
,
he
quickly
made
a
very
large
connection
;
and
on
levee
days
,
was
sometimes
known
to
have
as
many
as
twenty
half
-
pay
officers
waiting
their
turn
for
polishing
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
his
trade
increased
to
that
extent
,
that
in
course
of
time
he
entertained
no
less
than
two
apprentices
,
besides
taking
for
his
wife
the
widow
of
an
eminent
bone
and
rag
collector
,
formerly
of
MilIbank
.
 
<EOS>
With
this
lady
(
who
assisted
in
the
business
)
he
lived
in
great
domestic
happiness
,
only
chequered
by
those
little
storms
which
serve
to
clear
the
atmosphere
of
wedlock
,
and
brighten
its
horizon
.
 
<EOS>
In
some
of
these
gusts
of
bad
weather
,
Mr
Tappertit
would
,
in
the
assertion
of
his
prerogative
,
so
far
forget
himself
,
as
to
correct
his
lady
with
a
brush
,
or
boot
,
or
shoe
;
while
she
(
but
only
in
extreme
cases
)
would
retaliate
by
taking
off
his
legs
,
and
leaving
him
exposed
to
the
derision
of
those
urchins
who
delight
in
mischief
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Miggs
,
baffled
in
all
her
schemes
,
matrimonial
and
otherwise
,
and
cast
upon
a
thankless
,
undeserving
world
,
turned
very
sharp
and
sour
;
and
did
at
length
become
so
acid
,
and
did
so
pinch
and
slap
and
tweak
the
hair
and
noses
of
the
youth
of
Golden
Lion
Court
,
that
she
was
by
one
consent
expelled
that
sanctuary
,
and
desired
to
bless
some
other
spot
of
earth
,
in
preference
.
 
<EOS>
It
chanced
at
that
moment
,
that
the
justices
of
the
peace
for
Middlesex
proclaimed
by
public
placard
that
they
stood
in
need
of
a
female
turnkey
for
the
County
Bridewell
,
and
appointed
a
day
and
hour
for
the
inspection
of
candidates
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Miggs
attending
at
the
time
appointed
,
was
instantly
chosen
and
selected
from
one
hundred
and
twenty
-
four
competitors
,
and
at
once
promoted
to
the
office
;
which
she
held
until
her
decease
,
more
than
thirty
years
afterwards
,
remaining
single
all
that
time
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
observed
of
this
lady
that
while
she
was
inflexible
and
grim
to
all
her
female
flock
,
she
was
particularly
so
to
those
who
could
establish
any
claim
to
beauty
:
and
it
was
often
remarked
as
a
proof
of
her
indomitable
virtue
and
severe
chastity
,
that
to
such
as
had
been
frail
<EOS>
she
showed
no
mercy
;
always
falling
upon
them
on
the
slightest
occasion
,
or
on
no
occasion
at
all
,
with
the
fullest
measure
of
her
wrath
.
 
<EOS>
Among
other
useful
inventions
which
she
practised
upon
this
class
of
offenders
and
bequeathed
to
posterity
,
was
the
art
of
inflicting
an
exquisitely
vicious
poke
or
dig
with
the
wards
of
a
key
in
the
small
of
the
back
,
near
the
spine
.
 
<EOS>
She
likewise
originated
a
mode
of
treading
by
accident
(
in
pattens
)
on
such
as
had
small
feet
;
also
very
remarkable
for
its
ingenuity
,
and
previously
quite
unknown
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
very
long
,
you
may
be
sure
,
before
Joe
Willet
and
Dolly
Varden
were
made
husband
and
wife
,
and
with
a
handsome
sum
in
bank
(
for
the
locksmith
could
afford
to
give
his
daughter
a
good
dowry
)
,
reopened
the
Maypole
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
very
long
,
you
may
be
sure
,
before
a
red
-
faced
little
boy
was
seen
staggering
about
the
Maypole
passage
,
and
kicking
up
his
heels
on
the
green
before
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
very
long
,
counting
by
years
,
before
there
was
a
red
-
faced
little
girl
,
another
red
-
faced
little
boy
,
and
a
whole
troop
of
girls
and
boys
:
so
that
,
go
to
Chigwell
when
you
would
,
there
would
surely
be
seen
,
either
in
the
village
street
,
or
on
the
green
,
or
frolicking
in
the
farm
-
yard
<EOS>
---
for
it
was
a
farm
now
,
as
well
as
a
tavern
---
more
small
Joes
and
small
Dollys
than
could
be
easily
counted
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
a
very
long
time
before
these
appearances
ensued
;
but
it
WAS
a
VERY
long
time
before
Joe
looked
five
years
older
,
or
Dolly
either
,
or
the
locksmith
either
,
or
his
wife
either
:
for
cheerfulness
and
content
are
great
beautifiers
,
and
are
famous
preservers
of
youthful
looks
,
depend
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
long
time
,
too
,
before
there
was
such
a
country
inn
as
the
Maypole
,
in
all
England
:
indeed
it
is
a
great
question
whether
there
has
ever
been
such
another
to
this
hour
,
or
ever
will
be
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
long
time
too
---
for
Never
<EOS>
,
as
the
proverb
says
,
is
a
long
day
---
 
before
they
forgot
to
have
an
interest
in
wounded
soldiers
at
the
Maypole
,
or
before
Joe
omitted
to
refresh
them
,
for
the
sake
of
his
old
campaign
;
or
before
the
serjeant
left
off
looking
in
there
,
now
and
then
;
or
before
they
fatigued
themselves
,
or
each
other
,
by
talking
on
these
occasions
of
battles
and
sieges
,
and
hard
weather
and
hard
service
,
and
a
thousand
things
belonging
to
a
soldier
's
life
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
the
great
silver
snuff
-
box
which
the
King
sent
Joe
with
his
own
hand
,
because
of
his
conduct
in
the
Riots
,
what
guest
ever
went
to
the
Maypole
without
putting
finger
and
thumb
into
that
box
,
and
taking
a
great
pinch
,
though
he
had
never
taken
a
pinch
of
snuff
before
,
and
almost
sneezed
himself
into
convulsions

As
to
the
purple
-
faced
vintner
,
where
is
the
man
who
lived
in
those
times
and
never
saw
HIM
at
the
Maypole
:
to
all
appearance
as
much
at
home
in
the
best
room
,
as
if
he
lived
there
?
 
<EOS>
And
as
to
the
feastings
and
christenings
,
and
revellings
at
Christmas
,
and
celebrations
of
birthdays
,
wedding
-
days
,
and
all
manner
of
days
,
both
at
the
Maypole
and
the
Golden
Key
,
---
if
they
are
not
notorious
,
what
facts
are
?
  
<EOS>
Mr
Willet
the
elder
,
having
been
by
some
extraordinary
means
possessed
with
the
idea
that
Joe
wanted
to
be
married
,
and
that
it
would
be
well
for
him
,
his
father
,
to
retire
into
private
life
,
and
enable
him
to
live
in
comfort
,
took
up
his
abode
in
a
small
cottage
at
Chigwell
;
where
they
widened
and
enlarged
the
fireplace
for
him
,
hung
up
the
boiler
,
and
furthermore
planted
in
the
little
garden
outside
the
front
-
door
,
a
fictitious
Maypole
;
so
that
he
was
quite
at
home
directly
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
,
his
new
habitation
,
Tom
Cobb
,
Phil
Parkes
,
and
Solomon
Daisy
went
regularly
every
night
:
and
in
the
chimney
-
corner
,
they
all
four
quaffed
,
and
smoked
,
and
prosed
,
and
dozed
,
as
they
had
done
of
old
.
 
<EOS>
It
being
accidentally
discovered
after
a
short
time
that
Mr
Willet
still
appeared
to
consider
himself
a
landlord
by
profession
,
Joe
provided
him
with
a
slate
,
upon
which
the
old
man
regularly
scored
up
vast
accounts
for
meat
,
drink
,
and
tobacco
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
grew
older
this
passion
increased
upon
him
;
and
it
became
his
delight
to
chalk
against
the
name
of
each
of
his
cronies
a
sum
of
enormous
magnitude
,
and
impossible
to
be
paid
:
and
such
was
his
secret
joy
in
these
entries
,
that
he
would
be
perpetually
seen
going
behind
the
door
to
look
at
them
,
and
coming
forth
again
,
suffused
with
the
liveliest
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
He
never
recovered
the
surprise
the
Rioters
had
given
him
,
and
remained
in
the
same
mental
condition
down
to
the
last
moment
of
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
like
to
have
been
brought
to
a
speedy
termination
by
the
first
sight
of
his
first
grandchild
,
which
appeared
to
fill
him
with
the
belief
that
some
alarming
miracle
had
happened
to
Joe
.
 
<EOS>
Being
promptly
blooded
,
however
,
by
a
skilful
surgeon
,
he
rallied
;
and
although
the
doctors
all
agreed
,
on
his
being
attacked
with
symptoms
of
apoplexy
six
months
afterwards
,
that
he
ought
to
die
,
and
took
it
very
ill
that
he
did
not
<EOS>
,
he
remained
alive
---
possibly
on
account
of
his
constitutional
slowness
---
 
for
nearly
seven
years
more
,
when
he
was
one
morning
found
speechless
in
his
bed
.
 
<EOS>
He
lay
in
this
state
,
free
from
all
tokens
of
uneasiness
,
for
a
whole
week
,
when
he
was
suddenly
restored
to
consciousness
by
hearing
the
nurse
whisper
in
his
son
's
ear
that
he
was
going
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
-
going
,
Joseph
,
"
said
Mr
Willet
,
turning
round
upon
the
instant
,
"
to
the
Salwanners
"
---
and
immediately
gave
up
the
ghost
.
  
<EOS>
He
left
a
large
sum
of
money
behind
him
;
even
more
than
he
was
supposed
to
have
been
worth
,
although
the
neighbours
,
according
to
the
custom
of
mankind
in
calculating
the
wealth
that
other
people
ought
to
have
saved
,
had
estimated
his
property
in
good
round
numbers
.
 
<EOS>
Joe
inherited
the
whole
;
so
that
he
became
a
man
of
great
consequence
in
those
parts
,
and
was
perfectly
independent
.
  
<EOS>
Some
time
elapsed
before
Barnaby
got
the
better
of
the
shock
he
had
sustained
,
or
regained
his
old
health
and
gaiety
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
recovered
by
degrees
:
<EOS>
and
although
he
could
never
separate
his
condemnation
and
escape
from
the
idea
of
a
terrific
dream
,
he
became
,
in
other
respects
,
more
rational
.
 
<EOS>
Dating
from
the
time
of
his
recovery
,
he
had
a
better
memory
and
greater
steadiness
of
purpose
;
but
a
dark
cloud
overhung
his
whole
previous
existence
,
and
never
cleared
away
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
not
the
less
happy
for
this
,
for
his
love
of
freedom
and
interest
in
all
that
moved
or
grew
,
or
had
its
being
in
the
elements
,
remained
to
him
unimpaired
.
 
<EOS>
He
lived
with
his
mother
on
the
Maypole
farm
,
tending
the
poultry
and
the
cattle
,
working
in
a
garden
of
his
own
,
and
helping
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
known
to
every
bird
and
beast
about
the
place
,
and
had
a
name
for
every
one
.
<EOS>
Never
was
there
a
lighter
-
hearted
husbandman
,
a
creature
more
popular
with
young
and
old
,
a
blither
or
more
happy
soul
than
Barnaby
;
and
though
he
was
free
to
ramble
where
he
would
,
he
never
quitted
Her
,
but
was
for
evermore
her
stay
and
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
remarkable
that
although
he
had
that
dim
sense
of
the
past
,
he
sought
out
Hugh
's
dog
,
and
took
him
under
his
care
;
and
that
he
never
could
be
tempted
into
London
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
Riots
were
many
years
old
,
and
Edward
and
his
wife
came
back
to
England
with
a
family
almost
as
numerous
as
Dolly
's
,
and
one
day
appeared
at
the
Maypole
porch
,
he
knew
them
instantly
,
and
wept
and
leaped
for
joy
.
 
<EOS>
But
neither
to
visit
them
,
nor
on
any
other
pretence
,
no
matter
how
full
of
promise
and
enjoyment
,
could
he
be
persuaded
to
set
foot
in
the
streets
:
nor
did
he
ever
conquer
this
repugnance
or
look
upon
the
town
again
.
  
<EOS>
Grip
soon
recovered
his
looks
,
and
became
as
glossy
and
sleek
as
ever
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
profoundly
silent
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
he
had
forgotten
the
art
of
Polite
Conversation
in
Newgate
,
or
had
made
a
vow
in
those
troubled
times
to
forego
,
for
a
period
,
the
display
of
his
accomplishments
,
is
matter
of
uncertainty
;
but
certain
it
is
that
for
a
whole
year
he
never
indulged
in
any
other
sound
than
a
grave
,
decorous
croak
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
expiration
of
that
term
,
the
morning
being
very
bright
and
sunny
,
he
was
heard
to
address
himself
to
the
horses
in
the
stable
,
upon
the
subject
of
the
Kettle
,
so
often
mentioned
in
these
pages
;
and
before
the
witness
who
overheard
him
could
run
into
the
house
with
the
intelligence
,
and
add
to
it
upon
his
solemn
affirmation
the
statement
that
he
had
heard
him
laugh
,
the
bird
himself
advanced
with
fantastic
steps
to
the
very
door
of
the
bar
,
and
there
cried
,
"
I
'm
a
devil
,
I
'm
a
devil
,
I
'm
a
devil
!
"
<EOS>
with
extraordinary
rapture
.
  
<EOS>
From
that
period
(
although
he
was
supposed
to
be
much
affected
by
the
death
of
Mr
Willet
senior
)
,
he
constantly
practised
and
improved
himself
in
the
vulgar
tongue
;
and
,
as
he
was
a
mere
infant
for
a
raven
when
Barnaby
was
grey
,
he
has
very
probably
gone
on
talking
to
the
present
time
.
