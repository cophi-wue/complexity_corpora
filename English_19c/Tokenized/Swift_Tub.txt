 
TO
THE
RIGHT
HONOURABLE
JOHN
LORD
SOMERS
.
  
<EOS>
My
LORD
,
  
Though
the
author
has
written
a
large
Dedication
,
yet
that
being
addressed
to
a
Prince
whom
I
am
never
likely
to
have
the
honour
of
being
known
to
;
a
person
,
besides
,
as
far
as
I
can
observe
,
not
at
all
regarded
or
thought
on
by
any
of
our
present
writers
;
and
I
being
wholly
free
from
that
slavery
which
booksellers
usually
lie
under
to
the
caprices
of
authors
,
I
think
it
a
wise
piece
of
presumption
to
inscribe
these
papers
to
your
Lordship
,
and
to
implore
your
Lordship
's
protection
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
God
and
your
Lordship
know
their
faults
and
their
merits
;
for
as
to
my
own
particular
,
I
am
altogether
a
stranger
to
the
matter
;
and
though
everybody
else
should
be
equally
ignorant
,
I
do
not
fear
the
sale
of
the
book
at
all
the
worse
upon
that
score
.
 
<EOS>
Your
Lordship
's
name
on
the
front
in
capital
letters
will
at
any
time
get
off
one
edition
:
 
neither
<EOS>
would
I
desire
any
other
help
to
grow
an
alderman
than
a
patent
for
the
sole
privilege
of
dedicating
to
your
Lordship
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
now
,
in
right
of
a
dedicator
,
give
your
Lordship
a
list
of
your
own
virtues
,
and
at
the
same
time
be
very
unwilling
to
offend
your
modesty
;
but
chiefly
I
should
celebrate
your
liberality
towards
men
of
great
parts
and
small
fortunes
,
and
give
you
broad
hints
that
I
mean
myself
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
was
just
going
on
in
the
usual
method
to
peruse
a
hundred
or
two
of
dedications
,
and
transcribe
an
abstract
to
be
applied
to
your
Lordship
,
but
I
was
diverted
by
a
certain
accident
.
 
<EOS>
For
upon
the
covers
of
these
papers
I
casually
observed
written
in
large
letters
the
two
following
words
,
DETUR
DIGNISSIMO
,
which
,
for
aught
I
knew
,
might
contain
some
important
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
unluckily
fell
out
that
none
of
the
Authors
I
employ
understood
Latin
(
though
I
have
them
often
in
pay
to
translate
out
of
that
language
)
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
therefore
compelled
to
have
recourse
to
the
Curate
of
our
Parish
,
who
Englished
it
thus
,
Let
it
be
given
to
the
worthiest
;
and
his
comment
was
that
the
Author
meant
his
work
should
be
dedicated
to
the
sublimest
genius
of
the
age
for
wit
,
learning
,
judgment
,
eloquence
,
and
wisdom
.
 
<EOS>
I
called
at
a
poet
's
chamber
(
who
works
for
my
shop
)
in
an
alley
hard
by
,
showed
him
the
translation
,
and
desired
his
opinion
who
it
was
that
the
Author
could
mean
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
me
,
after
some
consideration
,
that
vanity
was
a
thing
he
abhorred
,
but
by
the
description
he
thought
himself
to
be
the
person
aimed
at
;
and
at
the
same
time
he
very
kindly
offered
his
own
assistance
gratis
towards
penning
a
dedication
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
I
desired
him
,
however
,
to
give
a
second
guess
.
 
<EOS>
Why
then
,
said
he
,
it
must
be
I
,
or
my
Lord
Somers
.
 
<EOS>
From
thence
I
went
to
several
other
wits
of
my
acquaintance
,
with
no
small
hazard
and
weariness
to
my
person
,
from
a
prodigious
number
of
dark
winding
stairs
;
but
found
them
all
in
the
same
story
,
both
of
your
Lordship
and
themselves
.
<EOS>
Now
your
Lordship
is
to
understand
that
this
proceeding
was
not
of
my
own
invention
;
for
I
have
somewhere
heard
it
is
a
maxim
<EOS>
that
those
to
whom
everybody
allows
the
second
place
have
an
undoubted
title
to
the
first
.
  
<EOS>
This
infallibly
convinced
me
that
your
Lordship
was
the
person
intended
by
the
Author
.
 
<EOS>
But
being
very
unacquainted
in
the
style
and
form
of
dedications
,
I
employed
those
wits
aforesaid
to
furnish
me
with
hints
and
materials
towards
a
panegyric
upon
your
Lordship
's
virtues
.
  
<EOS>
In
two
days
they
brought
me
ten
sheets
of
paper
filled
up
on
every
side
.
 
<EOS>
They
swore
to
me
that
they
had
ransacked
whatever
could
be
found
in
the
characters
of
Socrates
,
Aristides
,
Epaminondas
,
Cato
,
Tully
,
Atticus
,
and
other
hard
names
which
I
can
not
now
recollect
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
have
reason
to
believe
they
imposed
upon
my
ignorance
,
because
when
I
came
to
read
over
their
collections
,
there
was
not
a
syllable
there
<EOS>
but
what
I
and
everybody
else
knew
as
well
as
themselves
:
 
<EOS>
therefore
I
grievously
suspect
a
cheat
;
and
that
these
Authors
of
mine
stole
and
transcribed
every
word
from
the
universal
report
of
mankind
.
 
<EOS>
So
that
I
took
upon
myself
as
fifty
shillings
out
of
pocket
to
no
manner
of
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
If
by
altering
the
title
I
could
make
the
same
materials
serve
for
another
dedication
(
as
my
betters
have
done
)
,
it
would
help
to
make
up
my
loss
;
but
I
have
made
several
persons
dip
here
and
there
in
those
papers
,
and
before
they
read
three
lines
they
have
all
assured
me
plainly
that
they
can
not
possibly
be
applied
to
any
person
besides
your
Lordship
.
  
<EOS>
I
expected
,
indeed
,
to
have
heard
of
your
Lordship
's
bravery
at
the
head
of
an
army
;
of
your
undaunted
courage
in
mounting
a
breach
or
scaling
a
wall
;
or
to
have
had
your
pedigree
traced
in
a
lineal
descent
from
the
House
of
Austria
;
or
of
your
wonderful
talent
at
dress
and
dancing
;
or
your
profound
knowledge
in
algebra
,
metaphysics
,
and
the
Oriental
tongues
:
 
but
to
ply
the
world
with
an
old
beaten
story
of
your
wit
,
and
eloquence
,
and
learning
,
and
wisdom
,
and
justice
,
and
politeness
,
and
candour
,
and
evenness
of
temper
in
all
scenes
of
life
;
of
that
great
discernment
in
discovering
and
readiness
in
favouring
deserving
men
;
with
forty
other
common
topics
;
I
confess
I
have
neither
conscience
nor
countenance
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
Because
there
is
no
virtue
either
of
a
public
or
private
life
which
some
circumstances
of
your
own
have
not
often
produced
upon
the
stage
of
the
world
;
and
those
few
which
for
want
of
occasions
to
exert
them
might
otherwise
have
passed
unseen
or
unobserved
by
your
friends
,
your
enemies
have
at
length
brought
to
light
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
true
I
should
be
very
loth
<EOS>
the
bright
example
of
your
Lordship
's
virtues
should
be
lost
to
after
-
ages
,
both
for
their
sake
and
your
own
;
but
chiefly
because
they
will
be
so
very
necessary
to
adorn
the
history
of
a
late
reign
;
and
that
is
another
reason
why
I
would
forbear
to
make
a
recital
of
them
here
;
because
I
have
been
told
by
wise
men
that
as
dedications
have
run
for
some
years
past
,
a
good
historian
will
not
be
apt
to
have
recourse
thither
in
search
of
characters
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
one
point
wherein
I
think
we
dedicators
would
do
well
to
change
our
measures
;
I
mean
,
instead
of
running
on
so
far
upon
the
praise
of
our
patron
's
liberality
,
to
spend
a
word
or
two
in
admiring
their
patience
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
put
no
greater
compliment
on
your
Lordship
's
than
by
giving
you
so
ample
an
occasion
to
exercise
it
at
present
.
 
<EOS>
Though
perhaps
I
shall
not
be
apt
to
reckon
much
merit
to
your
Lordship
upon
that
score
,
who
having
been
formerly
used
to
tedious
harangues
,
and
sometimes
to
as
little
purpose
,
will
be
the
readier
to
pardon
this
,
especially
when
it
is
offered
by
one
who
is
,
with
all
respect
and
veneration
,
  
<EOS>
My
LORD
,
Your
Lordship
's
most
obedient
and
most
faithful
Servant
,
THE
BOOKSELLER
.
  
<EOS>
THE
BOOKSELLER
TO
THE
READER
  
<EOS>
It
is
now
six
years
since
these
papers
came
first
to
my
hand
,
which
seems
to
have
been
about
a
twelvemonth
after
they
were
written
,
for
the
Author
tells
us
in
his
preface
to
the
first
treatise
that
he
had
calculated
it
for
the
year
1697
;
and
in
several
passages
of
that
discourse
,
as
well
as
the
second
,
it
appears
they
were
written
about
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
the
Author
,
I
can
give
no
manner
of
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
I
am
credibly
informed
that
this
publication
is
without
his
knowledge
,
for
he
concludes
the
copy
is
lost
,
having
lent
it
to
a
person
since
dead
,
and
being
never
in
possession
of
it
after
;
so
that
,
whether
the
work
received
his
last
hand
,
or
whether
he
intended
to
fill
up
the
defective
places
,
is
like
to
remain
a
secret
.
  
<EOS>
If
I
should
go
about
to
tell
the
reader
by
what
accident
I
became
master
of
these
papers
,
it
would
,
in
this
unbelieving
age
,
pass
for
little
more
than
the
ca
nt
or
jargon
of
the
trade
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
gladly
spare
both
him
and
myself
so
unnecessary
a
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
There
yet
remains
a
difficult
question
 
why
I
published
them
no
sooner
?
 
<EOS>
I
forbore
upon
two
accounts
.
 
<EOS>
First
,
because
I
thought
I
had
better
work
upon
my
hands
;
and
secondly
,
because
I
was
not
without
some
hope
of
hearing
from
the
Author
and
receiving
his
directions
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
have
been
lately
alarmed
with
intelligence
of
a
surreptitious
copy
which
a
certain
great
wit
had
new
polished
and
refined
,
or
,
<EOS>
as
our
present
writers
express
themselves
,
"
fitted
to
the
humour
of
the
age
,
"
as
they
have
already
done
with
great
felicity
to
Don
Quixote
,
Boccalini
,
La
Bruyere
,
and
other
authors
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
I
thought
it
fairer
dealing
to
offer
the
whole
work
in
its
naturals
.
 
<EOS>
If
any
gentleman
will
please
to
furnish
me
with
a
key
,
in
order
to
explain
the
more
difficult
parts
,
I
shall
very
gratefully
acknowledge
the
favour
,
and
print
it
by
itself
.
  
<EOS>
THE
EPISTLE
DEDICATORY
TO
HIS
ROYAL
HIGHNESS
<EOS>
PRINCE
POSTERITY
  
<EOS>
SIR
,
  
<EOS>
I
here
present
your
Highness
with
the
fruits
of
a
very
few
leisure
hours
,
stolen
from
the
short
intervals
of
a
world
of
business
,
and
of
an
employment
quite
alien
from
such
amusements
as
this
;
the
poor
production
of
that
refuse
of
time
which
has
lain
heavy
upon
my
hands
during
a
long
prorogation
of
Parliament
,
a
great
dearth
of
foreign
news
,
and
a
tedious
fit
of
rainy
weather
.
 
<EOS>
For
which
,
and
other
reasons
,
it
can
not
choose
extremely
to
deserve
such
a
patronage
as
that
of
your
Highness
,
whose
numberless
virtues
in
so
few
years
,
make
the
world
look
upon
you
as
the
future
example
to
all
princes
.
<EOS>
For
although
your
Highness
is
hardly
got
clear
of
infancy
,
yet
has
the
universal
learned
world
already
resolved
upon
appealing
to
your
future
dictates
with
the
lowest
and
most
resigned
submission
,
fate
having
decreed
you
sole
arbiter
of
the
productions
of
human
wit
in
this
polite
and
most
accomplished
age
.
 
<EOS>
Methinks
the
number
of
appellants
were
enough
to
shock
and
startle
any
judge
of
a
genius
less
unlimited
than
yours
;
but
in
order
to
prevent
such
glorious
trials
,
the
person
,
it
seems
,
to
whose
care
the
education
of
your
Highness
is
committed
,
has
resolved
,
as
I
am
told
,
to
keep
you
in
almost
an
universal
ignorance
of
our
studies
,
which
it
is
your
inherent
birthright
to
inspect
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
amazing
to
me
that
this
person
should
have
assurance
,
in
the
face
of
the
sun
,
to
go
about
persuading
your
Highness
that
our
age
is
almost
wholly
illiterate
and
has
hardly
produced
one
writer
upon
any
subject
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
very
well
that
when
your
Highness
shall
come
to
riper
years
,
and
have
gone
through
the
learning
of
antiquity
,
you
will
be
too
curious
to
neglect
inquiring
into
the
authors
of
the
very
age
before
you
;
and
to
think
that
this
insolent
,
in
the
account
he
is
preparing
for
your
view
,
designs
to
reduce
them
to
a
number
so
insignificant
as
I
am
ashamed
to
mention
;
it
moves
my
zeal
and
my
spleen
for
the
honour
and
interest
of
our
vast
flourishing
body
,
as
well
as
of
myself
,
for
whom
I
know
by
long
experience
he
has
professed
,
and
still
continues
,
a
peculiar
malice
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
not
unlikely
that
,
when
your
Highness
will
one
day
peruse
what
I
am
now
writing
,
you
may
be
ready
to
expostulate
with
your
governor
upon
the
credit
of
what
I
here
affirm
,
and
command
him
to
show
you
some
of
our
productions
.
 
<EOS>
To
which
he
will
answer
 
for
I
am
well
informed
of
his
designs
 
by
asking
your
Highness
where
they
are
,
and
what
is
become
of
them
?
<EOS>
and
pretend
it
a
demonstration
that
there
never
were
any
,
because
they
are
not
then
to
be
found
.
 
<EOS>
Not
to
be
found
!
 
<EOS>
Who
has
mislaid
them
?
 
<EOS>
Are
they
sunk
in
the
abyss
of
things
?
<EOS>
It
is
certain
that
in
their
own
nature
they
were
light
enough
to
swim
upon
the
surface
for
all
eternity
;
therefore
,
the
fault
is
in
him
who
tied
weights
so
heavy
to
their
heels
as
to
depress
them
to
the
centre
.
 
<EOS>
Is
their
very
essence
destroyed
?
 
<EOS>
Who
has
annihilated
them
?
 
<EOS>
Were
they
drowned
by
purges
or
martyred
by
pipes
?
 
<EOS>
Who
administered
them
to
the
posteriors
of
#
#
#
#
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
it
may
no
longer
be
a
doubt
with
your
Highness
who
is
to
be
the
author
of
this
universal
ruin
<EOS>
,
I
beseech
you
to
observe
that
large
and
terrible
scythe
which
your
governor
affects
to
bear
continually
about
him
.
<EOS>
Be
pleased
to
remark
the
length
and
strength
,
the
sharpness
and
hardness
,
of
his
nails
and
teeth
;
consider
his
baneful
,
abominable
breath
,
enemy
to
life
and
matter
,
infectious
and
corrupting
,
and
then
reflect
whether
it
be
possible
for
any
mortal
ink
and
paper
of
this
generation
to
make
a
suitable
resistance
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
that
your
Highness
would
one
day
resolve
to
disarm
this
usurping
maitre
de
palais
of
his
furious
engines
,
and
bring
your
empire
hors
du
page
.
  
<EOS>
It
were
endless
to
recount
the
several
methods
of
tyranny
and
destruction
which
your
governor
is
pleased
to
practise
upon
this
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
His
inveterate
malice
is
such
to
the
writings
of
our
age
,
that
,
of
several
thousands
produced
yearly
from
this
renowned
city
,
before
the
next
revolution
of
the
sun
there
is
not
one
to
be
heard
of
.
 
<EOS>
Unhappy
infants
!
<EOS>
many
of
them
barbarously
destroyed
before
they
have
so
much
as
learnt
their
mother
-
tongue
to
beg
for
pity
.
 
<EOS>
Some
<EOS>
he
stifles
in
their
cradles
,
others
he
frights
into
convulsions
,
whereof
they
suddenly
die
,
some
<EOS>
he
flays
alive
<EOS>
,
others
he
tears
limb
from
limb
,
great
numbers
are
offered
to
Moloch
,
and
the
rest
,
tainted
by
his
breath
,
die
of
a
languishing
consumption
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
concern
I
have
most
at
heart
is
for
our
Corporation
of
Poets
,
from
whom
I
am
preparing
a
petition
to
your
Highness
,
to
be
subscribed
with
the
names
of
one
hundred
and
thirty
-
six
of
the
first
race
,
but
whose
immortal
productions
are
never
likely
to
reach
your
eyes
,
though
each
of
them
is
now
an
humble
and
an
earnest
appellant
for
the
laurel
,
and
has
large
comely
volumes
ready
to
show
for
a
support
to
his
pretensions
.
 
<EOS>
The
never
-
dying
works
of
these
illustrious
persons
your
governor
,
sir
,
has
devoted
to
unavoidable
death
,
and
your
Highness
is
to
be
made
believe
that
our
age
has
never
arrived
at
the
honour
to
produce
one
single
poet
.
  
<EOS>
We
confess
immortality
to
be
a
great
and
powerful
goddess
,
but
in
vain
we
offer
up
to
her
our
devotions
and
our
sacrifices
if
your
Highness
's
governor
,
who
has
usurped
the
priesthood
,
must
,
by
an
unparalleled
ambition
and
avarice
,
wholly
intercept
and
devour
them
.
  
<EOS>
To
affirm
that
our
age
is
altogether
unlearned
and
devoid
of
writers
in
any
kind
,
seems
to
be
an
assertion
so
bold
and
so
false
,
that
I
have
been
sometimes
thinking
the
contrary
may
almost
be
proved
by
uncontrollable
demonstration
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
true
,
indeed
,
that
although
their
numbers
be
vast
and
their
productions
numerous
in
proportion
,
yet
are
they
hurried
so
hastily
off
the
scene
that
they
escape
our
memory
and
delude
our
sight
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
first
thought
of
this
address
,
I
had
prepared
a
copious
list
of
titles
to
present
your
Highness
as
an
undisputed
argument
for
what
I
affirm
.
 
<EOS>
The
originals
were
posted
fresh
upon
all
gates
and
corners
of
streets
;
but
returning
in
a
very
few
hours
to
take
a
review
,
they
were
all
torn
down
and
fresh
ones
in
their
places
.
 
<EOS>
I
inquired
after
them
among
readers
and
booksellers
,
but
I
inquired
in
vain
;
the
memorial
of
them
was
lost
among
men
<EOS>
,
their
place
was
no
more
to
be
found
;
and
I
was
laughed
to
scorn
for
a
clown
and
a
pedant
,
devoid
of
all
taste
and
refinement
,
little
versed
in
the
course
of
present
affairs
,
and
that
knew
nothing
of
what
had
passed
in
the
best
companies
of
court
and
town
.
<EOS>
So
that
I
can
only
avow
in
general
to
your
Highness
that
we
do
abound
in
learning
and
wit
,
but
to
fix
upon
particulars
is
a
task
too
slippery
for
my
slender
abilities
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
should
venture
,
in
a
windy
day
,
to
affirm
to
your
Highness
that
there
is
a
large
cloud
near
the
horizon
in
the
form
of
a
bear
,
another
in
the
zenith
with
the
head
of
an
ass
,
a
third
to
the
westward
with
claws
like
a
dragon
;
and
your
Highness
should
in
a
few
minutes
think
fit
to
examine
the
truth
<EOS>
,
it
is
certain
they
would
be
all
chanced
in
figure
and
position
,
new
ones
would
arise
,
and
all
we
could
agree
upon
would
be
,
that
clouds
there
were
,
but
that
I
was
grossly
mistaken
in
the
zoography
and
topography
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
But
your
governor
,
perhaps
,
may
still
insist
,
and
put
the
question
<EOS>
,
What
is
then
become
of
those
immense
bales
of
paper
which
must
needs
have
been
employed
in
such
numbers
of
books
?
 
<EOS>
Can
these
also
be
wholly
annihilated
,
and
to
of
a
sudden
,
as
I
pretend
?
 
<EOS>
What
shall
I
say
in
return
of
so
invidious
an
objection
?
 
<EOS>
It
ill
befits
the
distance
between
your
Highness
and
me
to
send
you
for
ocular
conviction
to
a
jakes
or
an
oven
,
to
the
windows
of
a
bawdyhouse
,
or
to
a
sordid
lanthorn
.
 
<EOS>
Books
,
like
men
their
authors
,
have
no
more
than
one
way
of
coming
into
the
world
,
but
there
are
ten
thousand
to
go
out
of
it
and
return
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
I
profess
to
your
Highness
,
in
the
integrity
of
my
heart
,
that
what
I
am
going
to
say
is
literally
true
<EOS>
this
minute
I
am
writing
;
what
revolutions
may
happen
before
it
shall
be
ready
for
your
perusal
<EOS>
I
can
by
no
means
warrant
;
however
,
I
beg
you
to
accept
it
as
a
specimen
of
our
learning
,
our
politeness
,
and
our
wit
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
therefore
affirm
,
upon
the
word
of
a
sincere
man
,
that
there
is
now
actually
in
being
a
certain
poet
called
John
Dryden
,
whose
translation
of
Virgil
was
lately
printed
in
large
folio
,
well
bound
,
and
if
diligent
search
were
made
,
for
aught
I
know
,
is
yet
to
be
seen
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
another
called
Nahum
Tate
,
who
is
ready
to
make
oath
that
he
has
caused
many
reams
of
verse
to
be
published
,
whereof
both
himself
and
his
bookseller
,
if
lawfully
required
,
can
still
produce
authentic
copies
,
and
therefore
wonders
why
the
world
is
pleased
to
make
such
a
secret
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
third
,
known
by
the
name
of
Tom
Durfey
,
a
poet
of
a
vast
comprehension
,
an
universal
genius
,
and
most
profound
learning
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
also
one
Mr.
Rymer
and
one
Mr.
Dennis
,
most
profound
critics
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
person
styled
Dr.
Bentley
,
who
has
wrote
near
a
thousand
pages
of
immense
erudition
,
giving
a
full
and
true
account
of
a
certain
squabble
of
wonderful
importance
between
himself
and
a
bookseller
;
he
is
a
writer
of
infinite
wit
and
humour
,
no
man
rallies
with
a
better
grace
and
in
more
sprightly
turns
.
 
<EOS>
Further
,
I
avow
to
your
Highness
that
with
these
eyes
I
have
beheld
the
person
of
William
Wotton
,
B.D.
,
who
has
written
a
good
-
sized
volume
against
a
friend
of
your
governor
,
from
whom
,
alas
!
<EOS>
he
must
therefore
look
for
little
favour
,
in
a
most
gentlemanly
style
,
adorned
with
utmost
politeness
and
civility
,
replete
with
discoveries
equally
valuable
for
their
novelty
and
use
,
and
embellished
with
traits
of
wit
so
poignant
and
so
apposite
,
that
he
is
a
worthy
yoke
-
mate
to
his
fore
-
mentioned
friend
.
  
<EOS>
Why
should
I
go
upon
farther
particulars
,
which
might
fill
a
volume
with
the
just
eulogies
of
my
contemporary
brethren
?
 
<EOS>
I
shall
bequeath
this
piece
of
justice
to
a
larger
work
<EOS>
,
wherein
I
intend
to
write
a
character
of
the
present
set
of
wits
in
our
nation
;
their
persons
I
shall
describe
particularly
and
at
length
,
their
genius
and
understandings
in
miniature
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
I
do
here
make
bold
to
present
your
Highness
with
a
faithful
abstract
drawn
from
the
universal
body
of
all
arts
and
sciences
,
intended
wholly
for
your
service
and
instruction
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
do
I
doubt
in
the
least
<EOS>
but
your
Highness
will
peruse
it
as
carefully
and
make
as
considerable
improvements
as
other
young
princes
have
already
done
by
the
many
volumes
of
late
years
written
for
a
help
to
their
studies
.
  
<EOS>
That
your
Highness
may
advance
in
wisdom
and
virtue
,
as
well
as
years
,
and
at
last
outshine
all
your
royal
ancestors
,
shall
be
the
daily
prayer
of
,
  
SIR
,
Your
Highness
's
most
devoted

<EOS>
THE
PREFACE
.
  
<EOS>
The
wits
of
the
present
age
being
so
very
numerous
and
penetrating
,
it
seems
the
grandees
of
Church
and
State
begin
to
fall
under
horrible
apprehensions
lest
these
gentlemen
,
during
the
intervals
of
a
long
peace
,
should
find
leisure
to
pick
holes
in
the
weak
sides
of
religion
and
government
.
 
<EOS>
To
prevent
which
,
there
has
been
much
thought
employed
of
late
upon
certain
projects
for
taking
off
the
force
and
edge
of
those
formidable
inquirers
from
canvassing
and
reasoning
upon
such
delicate
points
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
at
length
fixed
upon
one
,
which
will
require
some
time
as
well
as
cost
to
perfect
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
danger
hourly
increasing
,
by
new
levies
of
wits
,
all
appointed
(
as
there
is
reason
to
fear
)
with
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
which
may
at
an
hour
's
warning
be
drawn
out
into
pamphlets
and
other
offensive
weapons
ready
for
immediate
execution
,
it
was
judged
of
absolute
necessity
that
some
present
expedient
be
thought
on
till
the
main
design
can
be
brought
to
maturity
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
end
,
at
a
grand
committee
,
some
days
ago
,
this
important
discovery
was
made
by
a
certain
curious
and
refined
observer
,
that
seamen
have
a
custom
when
they
meet
a
Whale
to
fling
him
out
an
empty
Tub
,
by
way
of
amusement
,
to
divert
him
from
laying
violent
hands
upon
the
Ship
.
<EOS>
This
parable
was
immediately
mythologised
;
the
Whale
was
interpreted
to
be
Hobbes
's
"
Leviathan
,
"
which
tosses
and
plays
with
all
other
schemes
of
religion
and
government
,
whereof
a
great
many
are
hollow
,
and
dry
,
and
empty
,
and
noisy
,
and
wooden
,
and
given
to
rotation
.
<EOS>
This
is
the
Leviathan
from
whence
<EOS>
the
terrible
wits
of
our
age
are
said
to
borrow
their
weapons
.
 
<EOS>
The
Ship
in
danger
is
easily
understood
to
be
its
old
antitype
the
commonwealth
.
 
<EOS>
But
how
to
analyse
the
Tub
was
a
matter
of
difficulty
,
when
,
after
long
inquiry
and
debate
,
the
literal
meaning
was
preserved
,
and
it
was
decreed
that
,
in
order
to
prevent
these
Leviathans
from
tossing
and
sporting
with
the
commonwealth
,
which
of
itself
is
too
apt
to
fluctuate
,
they
should
be
diverted
from
that
game
by
"
A
Tale
of
a
Tub
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
my
genius
being
conceived
to
lie
not
unhappily
that
way
<EOS>
,
I
had
the
honour
done
me
to
be
engaged
in
the
performance
.
  
<EOS>
This
is
the
sole
design
in
publishing
the
following
treatise
,
which
I
hope
will
serve
for
an
interim
of
some
months
to
employ
those
unquiet
spirits
till
the
perfecting
of
that
great
work
,
into
the
secret
of
which
it
is
reasonable
the
courteous
reader
should
have
some
little
light
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
intended
that
a
large
Academy
be
erected
,
capable
of
containing
nine
thousand
seven
hundred
forty
and
three
persons
,
which
,
by
modest
computation
,
is
reckoned
to
be
pretty
near
the
current
number
of
wits
in
this
island
.
 
<EOS>
These
are
to
be
disposed
into
the
several
schools
of
this
Academy
,
and
there
pursue
those
studies
to
which
their
genius
most
inclines
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
undertaker
himself
will
publish
his
proposals
with
all
convenient
speed
,
to
which
I
shall
refer
the
curious
reader
for
a
more
particular
account
,
mentioning
at
present
only
a
few
of
the
principal
schools
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
,
first
,
a
large
pederastic
school
,
with
French
and
Italian
masters
;
there
is
also
the
spelling
school
,
a
very
spacious
building
;
the
school
of
looking
-
glasses
;
the
school
of
swearing
;
the
school
of
critics
;
the
school
of
salivation
;
the
school
of
hobby
-
horses
;
the
school
of
poetry
;
the
school
of
tops
;
the
school
of
spleen
;
the
school
of
gaming
;
with
many
others
too
tedious
to
recount
.
 
<EOS>
No
person
to
be
admitted
member
into
any
of
these
schools
without
an
attestation
under
two
sufficient
persons
'
hands
certifying
him
to
be
a
wit
.
  
<EOS>
But
to
return
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sufficiently
instructed
in
the
principal
duty
of
a
preface
if
my
genius
,
were
capable
of
arriving
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
Thrice
<EOS>
have
I
forced
my
imagination
to
take
the
tour
of
my
invention
,
and
thrice
<EOS>
it
has
returned
empty
,
the
latter
having
been
wholly
drained
by
the
following
treatise
.
 
<EOS>
Not
so
my
more
successful
brethren
<EOS>
the
moderns
,
who
will
by
no
means
let
slip
a
preface
or
dedication
without
some
notable
distinguishing
stroke
to
surprise
the
reader
at
the
entry
,
and
kindle
a
wonderful
expectation
of
what
is
to
ensue
.
<EOS>
Such
was
that
of
a
most
ingenious
poet
,
who
,
soliciting
his
brain
for
something
new
,
compared
himself
to
the
hangman
and
his
patron
to
the
patient
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
insigne
,
recens
,
indictum
ore
alio
.
<EOS>
When
I
went
through
that
necessary
and
noble
course
of
study
,
 
I
had
the
happiness
to
observe
many
such
egregious
touches
,
which
I
shall
not
injure
the
authors
by
transplanting
,
because
I
have
remarked
that
nothing
is
so
very
tender
as
a
modern
piece
of
wit
,
and
which
is
apt
to
suffer
so
much
in
the
carriage
.
 
<EOS>
Some
things
are
extremely
witty
to
-
day
,
or
fasting
,
or
in
this
place
,
or
at
eight
o'clock
,
or
over
a
bottle
,
or
spoke
by
Mr.
Whatdyecall'm
,
or
in
a
summer
's
morning
,
any
of
which
,
by
the
smallest
transposal
or
misapplication
,
is
utterly
annihilate
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
wit
has
its
walks
and
purlieus
,
out
of
which
it
may
not
stray
the
breadth
of
a
hair
,
upon
peril
of
being
lost
.
 
<EOS>
The
moderns
have
artfully
fixed
this
Mercury
,
and
reduced
it
to
the
circumstances
of
time
,
place
,
and
person
.
<EOS>
Such
a
jest
there
is
that
will
not
pass
out
of
Covent
Garden
,
and
such
a
one
that
is
nowhere
intelligible
but
at
Hyde
Park
Corner
.
<EOS>
Now
,
though
it
sometimes
tenderly
affects
me
to
consider
that
all
the
towardly
passages
I
shall
deliver
in
the
following
treatise
will
grow
quite
out
of
date
and
relish
with
the
first
shifting
of
the
present
scene
,
yet
I
must
need
subscribe
to
the
justice
of
this
proceeding
,
because
I
can
not
imagine
why
we
should
be
at
expense
to
furnish
wit
for
succeeding
ages
,
when
the
former
have
made
no
sort
of
provision
for
ours
;
wherein
I
speak
the
sentiment
of
the
very
newest
,
and
consequently
the
most
orthodox
refiners
,
as
well
as
my
own
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
being
extremely
solicitous
that
every
accomplished
person
who
has
got
into
the
taste
of
wit
calculated
for
this
present
month
of
August
1697
should
descend
to
the
very
bottom
of
all
the
sublime
throughout
this
treatise
,
I
hold
it
fit
to
lay
down
this
general
maxim
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
reader
desires
to
have
a
thorough
comprehension
of
an
author
's
thoughts
,
can
not
take
a
better
method
than
by
putting
himself
into
the
circumstances
and
posture
of
life
that
the
writer
was
in
upon
every
important
passage
as
it
flowed
from
his
pen
,
for
this
will
introduce
a
parity
and
strict
correspondence
of
ideas
between
the
reader
and
the
author
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
to
assist
the
diligent
reader
in
so
delicate
an
affair
 
as
far
as
brevity
will
permit
 
I
have
recollected
that
the
shrewdest
pieces
of
this
treatise
were
conceived
in
bed
in
a
garret
.
 
<EOS>
At
other
times
(
for
a
reason
best
known
to
myself
)
I
thought
fit
to
sharpen
my
invention
with
hunger
,
and
in
general
the
whole
work
was
begun
,
continued
,
and
ended
under
a
long
course
of
physic
and
a
great
want
of
money
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
I
do
affirm
it
will
be
absolutely
impossible
for
the
candid
peruser
to
go
along
with
me
in
a
great
many
bright
passages
,
unless
upon
the
several
difficulties
emergent
he
will
please
to
capacitate
and
prepare
himself
by
these
directions
.
 
<EOS>
And
this
I
lay
down
as
my
principal
postulatum
.
  
<EOS>
Because
I
have
professed
to
be
a
most
devoted
servant
of
all
modern
forms
,
I
apprehend
some
curious
wit
may
object
against
me
for
proceeding
thus
far
in
a
preface
without
declaiming
,
according
to
custom
,
against
the
multitude
of
writers
<EOS>
whereof
the
whole
multitude
of
writers
most
reasonably
complain
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
just
come
from
perusing
some
hundreds
of
prefaces
,
wherein
the
authors
do
at
the
very
beginning
address
the
gentle
reader
concerning
this
enormous
grievance
.
 
<EOS>
Of
these
I
have
preserved
a
few
examples
,
and
shall
set
them
down
as
near
as
my
memory
has
been
able
to
retain
them
.
  
<EOS>
One
begins
thus
:
 
"
For
a
man
to
set
up
for
a
writer
when
the
press
swarms
with
,
"
&
c.
  
Another
:
 
"
The
tax
upon
paper
does
not
lessen
the
number
of
scribblers
who
daily
pester
,
"
&
c.
  
<EOS>
Another
:
 
<EOS>
"
When
every
little
would
-
be
wit
takes
pen
in
hand
,
'
tis
in
vain
to
enter
the
lists
,
"
&
c.
  
Another
:
 
"
To
observe
what
trash
the
press
swarms
with
,
"
&
c.
  
Another
:
 
"
Sir
,
it
is
merely
in
obedience
to
your
commands
that
I
venture
into
the
public
,
for
who
upon
a
less
consideration
would
be
of
a
party
with
such
a
rabble
of
scribblers
,
"
&
c.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
I
have
two
words
in
my
own
defence
against
this
objection
.
<EOS>
First
,
I
am
far
from
granting
the
number
of
writers
a
nuisance
to
our
nation
,
having
strenuously
maintained
the
contrary
in
several
parts
of
the
following
discourse
;
secondly
,
I
do
not
well
understand
the
justice
of
this
proceeding
,
because
I
observe
many
of
these
polite
prefaces
to
be
not
only
from
the
same
hand
,
but
from
those
who
are
most
voluminous
in
their
several
productions
;
upon
which
I
shall
tell
the
reader
a
short
tale
.
  
<EOS>
A
mountebank
in
Leicester
Fields
had
drawn
a
huge
assembly
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
Among
the
rest
,
a
fat
unwieldy
fellow
,
half
stifled
in
the
press
,
would
be
every
fit
crying
out
,
"
Lord
!
<EOS>
what
a
filthy
crowd
is
here
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
good
people
,
give
way
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
Bless
need
what
a
devil
has
raked
this
rabble
together
.
 
<EOS>
Z####ds
,
what
squeezing
is
this
?
 
<EOS>
Honest
friend
,
remove
your
elbow
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
last
a
weaver
that
stood
next
him
could
hold
no
longer
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
plague
confound
you
,
"
said
he
,
"
for
an
overgrown
sloven
;
and
who
in
the
devil
's
name
,
I
wonder
,
helps
to
make
up
the
crowd
half
so
much
as
yourself
?
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
consider
that
you
take
up
more
room
with
that
carcass
than
any
five
here
?
 
<EOS>
Is
not
the
place
as
free
for
us
as
for
you
?
 
<EOS>
Bring
your
own
guts
to
a
reasonable
compass
,
and
then
I
'll
engage
we
shall
have
room
enough
for
us
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
are
certain
common
privileges
of
a
writer
<EOS>
,
the
benefit
whereof
<EOS>
I
hope
there
will
be
no
reason
to
doubt
;
particularly
,
that
where
I
am
not
understood
,
it
shall
be
concluded
that
something
very
useful
and
profound
is
couched
underneath
;
and
again
,
that
whatever
word
or
sentence
is
printed
in
a
different
character
shall
be
judged
to
contain
something
extraordinary
either
of
wit
or
sublime
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
the
liberty
I
have
thought
fit
to
take
of
praising
myself
,
upon
some
occasions
or
none
,
I
am
sure
it
will
need
no
excuse
if
a
multitude
of
great
examples
be
allowed
sufficient
authority
;
for
it
is
here
to
be
noted
that
praise
was
originally
a
pension
paid
by
the
world
,
but
the
moderns
,
finding
the
trouble
and
charge
too
great
in
collecting
it
,
have
lately
bought
out
the
fee
-
simple
,
since
which
time
the
right
of
presentation
is
wholly
in
ourselves
.
 
<EOS>
For
this
reason
it
is
that
when
an
author
makes
his
own
eulogy
,
he
uses
a
certain
form
to
declare
and
insist
upon
his
title
,
which
is
commonly
in
these
or
the
like
words
,
"
I
speak
without
vanity
,
"
which
I
think
plainly
shows
it
to
be
a
matter
of
right
and
justice
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
I
do
here
once
for
all
declare
,
that
in
every
encounter
of
this
nature
through
the
following
treatise
the
form
aforesaid
is
implied
,
which
I
mention
to
save
the
trouble
of
repeating
it
on
so
many
occasions
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
a
great
ease
to
my
conscience
that
I
have
written
so
elaborate
and
useful
a
discourse
without
one
grain
of
satire
intermixed
,
which
is
the
sole
point
wherein
I
have
taken
leave
to
dissent
from
the
famous
originals
of
our
age
and
country
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
observed
some
satirists
to
use
the
public
much
at
the
rate
that
pedants
do
a
naughty
boy
ready
horsed
for
discipline
.
 
<EOS>
First
expostulate
the
case
,
then
plead
the
necessity
of
the
rod
from
great
provocations
,
and
conclude
every
period
with
a
lash
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
if
I
know
anything
of
mankind
,
these
gentlemen
might
very
well
spare
their
reproof
and
correction
,
for
there
is
not
through
all
Nature
another
so
callous
and
insensible
a
member
as
the
world
's
posteriors
,
whether
you
apply
to
it
the
toe
or
the
birch
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
most
of
our
late
satirists
seem
to
lie
under
a
sort
of
mistake
,
that
because
nettles
have
the
prerogative
to
sting
,
therefore
all
other
weeds
must
do
so
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
not
this
comparison
out
of
the
least
design
to
detract
from
these
worthy
writers
,
for
it
is
well
known
among
mythologists
that
weeds
have
the
pre
-
eminence
over
all
other
vegetables
;
and
therefore
the
first
monarch
of
this
island
whose
taste
and
judgment
were
so
acute
and
refined
,
did
very
wisely
root
out
the
roses
from
the
collar
of
the
order
and
plant
the
thistles
in
their
stead
,
as
the
nobler
flower
of
the
two
.
 
<EOS>
For
which
reason
it
is
conjectured
by
profounder
antiquaries
that
the
satirical
itch
,
so
prevalent
in
this
part
of
our
island
,
was
first
brought
among
us
from
beyond
the
Tweed
.
 
<EOS>
Here
may
it
long
flourish
and
abound
;
may
it
survive
and
neglect
the
scorn
of
the
world
with
as
much
ease
and
contempt
as
the
world
is
insensible
to
the
lashes
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
May
their
own
dulness
,
or
that
of
their
party
,
be
no
discouragement
for
the
authors
to
proceed
;
but
let
them
remember
it
is
with
wits
as
with
razors
,
which
are
never
so
apt
to
cut
those
they
are
employed
on
as
when
they
have
lost
their
edge
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
those
whose
teeth
are
too
rotten
to
bite
are
best
of
all
others
qualified
to
revenge
that
defect
with
their
breath
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
not
,
like
other
men
,
to
envy
or
undervalue
the
talents
I
can
not
reach
,
for
which
reason
I
must
needs
bear
a
true
honour
to
this
large
eminent
sect
of
our
British
writers
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
hope
this
little
panegyric
will
not
be
offensive
to
their
ears
,
since
it
has
the
advantage
of
being
only
designed
for
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Nature
herself
has
taken
order
that
fame
and
honour
should
be
purchased
at
a
better
pennyworth
by
satire
than
by
any
other
productions
of
the
brain
,
the
world
being
soonest
provoked
to
praise
by
lashes
,
as
men
are
to
love
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
problem
in
an
ancient
author
why
dedications
and
other
bundles
of
flattery
run
all
upon
stale
musty
topics
,
without
the
smallest
tincture
of
anything
new
,
not
only
to
the
torment
and
nauseating
of
the
Christian
reader
,
but
,
if
not
suddenly
prevented
,
to
the
universal
spreading
of
that
pestilent
disease
the
lethargy
in
this
island
,
whereas
there
is
very
little
satire
which
has
not
something
in
it
untouched
before
.
 
<EOS>
The
defects
of
the
former
are
usually
imputed
to
the
want
of
invention
among
those
who
are
dealers
in
that
kind
;
but
I
think
with
a
great
deal
of
injustice
,
the
solution
being
easy
and
natural
,
for
the
materials
of
panegyric
,
being
very
few
in
number
,
have
been
long
since
exhausted
;
for
as
health
is
but
one
thing
,
and
has
been
always
the
same
,
whereas
diseases
are
by
thousands
,
besides
new
and
daily
additions
,
so
all
the
virtues
that
have
been
ever
in
mankind
are
to
be
counted
upon
a
few
fingers
,
but
his
follies
and
vices
are
innumerable
,
and
time
adds
hourly
to
the
heap
.
 
<EOS>
Now
the
utmost
a
poor
poet
can
do
is
to
get
by
heart
a
list
of
the
cardinal
virtues
and
deal
them
with
his
utmost
liberality
to
his
hero
or
his
patron
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
ring
the
changes
as
far
as
it
will
go
,
and
vary
his
phrase
till
he
has
talked
round
,
but
the
reader
quickly
finds
it
is
all
pork
,
 
with
a
little
variety
of
sauce
,
for
there
is
no
inventing
terms
of
art
beyond
our
ideas
,
and
when
ideas
are
exhausted
,
terms
of
art
must
be
so
too
.
  
<EOS>
But
though
the
matter
for
panegyric
were
as
fruitful
as
the
topics
of
satire
,
yet
would
it
not
be
hard
to
find
out
a
sufficient
reason
why
the
latter
will
be
always
better
received
than
the
first
;
for
this
being
bestowed
only
upon
one
or
a
few
persons
at
a
time
,
is
sure
to
raise
envy
,
and
consequently
ill
words
,
from
the
rest
who
have
no
share
in
the
blessing
.
 
<EOS>
But
satire
,
being
levelled
at
all
,
is
never
resented
for
an
offence
by
any
,
since
every
individual
person
makes
bold
to
understand
it
of
others
,
and
very
wisely
removes
his
particular
part
of
the
burden
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
World
,
which
are
broad
enough
and
able
to
bear
it
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
purpose
I
have
sometimes
reflected
upon
the
difference
between
Athens
and
England
with
respect
to
the
point
before
us
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
Attic
 
commonwealth
it
was
the
privilege
and
birthright
of
every
citizen
and
poet
to
rail
aloud
and
in
public
,
or
to
expose
upon
the
stage
by
name
any
person
they
pleased
,
though
of
the
greatest
figure
,
whether
a
Creon
,
an
Hyperbolus
,
an
Alcibiades
,
or
a
Demosthenes
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
on
the
other
side
,
the
least
reflecting
word
let
fall
against
the
people
in
general
was
immediately
caught
up
and
revenged
upon
the
authors
,
however
considerable
for
their
quality
or
their
merits
;
whereas
in
England
it
is
just
the
reverse
of
all
this
.
 
<EOS>
Here
you
may
securely
display
your
utmost
rhetoric
against
mankind
in
the
face
of
the
world
;
tell
them
that
all
are
gone
astray
;
that
there
is
none
that
doeth
good
,
no
,
not
one
;
that
we
live
in
the
very
dregs
of
time
;
that
knavery
and
atheism
are
epidemic
as
the
pox
;
that
honesty
is
fled
with
Astraea
;
with
any
other
common
-
places
equally
new
and
eloquent
,
which
are
furnished
by
the
splendida
bills
;
and
when
you
have
done
,
the
whole
audience
,
far
from
being
offended
,
shall
return
you
thanks
as
a
deliverer
of
precious
and
useful
truths
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
further
,
it
is
but
to
venture
your
lungs
,
and
you
may
preach
in
Covent
Garden
against
foppery
and
fornication
,
and
something
else
;
against
pride
,
and
dissimulation
,
and
bribery
at
Whitehall
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
expose
rapine
and
injustice
in
the
Inns
-
of
-
Court
chapel
,
and
in
a
City
pulpit
be
as
fierce
as
you
please
against
avarice
,
hypocrisy
,
and
extortion
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
but
a
ball
bandied
to
and
fro
,
and
<EOS>
every
man
carries
a
racket
about
him
to
strike
it
from
himself
among
the
rest
of
the
company
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
on
the
other
side
,
whoever
should
mistake
the
nature
of
things
so
far
as
to
drop
but
<EOS>
a
single
hint
in
public
how
such
a
one
starved
half
the
fleet
,
and
half
poisoned
the
rest
;
how
such
a
one
,
from
a
true
principle
of
love
and
honour
,
pays
no
debts
but
for
wenches
and
play
;
how
such
a
one
runs
out
of
his
estate
;
how
Paris
,
bribed
by
Juno
and
Venus
,
loath
to
offend
either
party
,
slept
out
the
whole
cause
on
the
bench
;
or
how
such
an
orator
makes
long
speeches
in
the
Senate
,
with
much
thought
,
little
sense
,
and
to
no
purpose
;
 
whoever
,
I
say
,
should
venture
to
be
thus
particular
,
must
expect
to
be
imprisoned
for
scandalum
magnatum
,
to
have
challenges
sent
him
,
to
be
sued
for
defamation
,
and
to
be
brought
before
the
bar
of
the
House
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
forget
that
I
am
expatiating
on
a
subject
<EOS>
wherein
I
have
no
concern
,
having
neither
a
talent
nor
an
inclination
for
satire
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
other
side
,
I
am
so
entirely
satisfied
with
the
whole
present
procedure
of
human
things
,
that
I
have
been
for
some
years
preparing
material
towards
"
A
Panegyric
upon
the
World
;
"
to
which
I
intended
to
add

<EOS>
Both
these
I
had
thoughts
to
publish
by
way
of
appendix
to
the
following
treatise
;
but
finding
my
common
-
place
book
fill
much
slower
than
I
had
reason
to
expect
<EOS>
,
I
have
chosen
to
defer
them
to
another
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
have
been
unhappily
prevented
in
that
design
by
a
certain
domestic
misfortune
,
in
the
particulars
whereof
,
though
it
would
be
very
seasonable
,
and
much
in
the
modern
way
,
to
inform
the
gentle
reader
,
and
would
also
be
of
great
assistance
towards
extending
this
preface
into
the
size
now
in
vogue
 
which
by
rule
ought
to
be
large
in
proportion
as
the
subsequent
volume
is
small
 
<EOS>
yet
I
shall
now
dismiss
our
impatient
reader
from
any
further
attendance
at
the
porch
;
and
having
duly
prepared
his
mind
by
a
preliminary
discourse
,
shall
gladly
introduce
him
to
the
sublime
mysteries
that
ensue
.

SECTION
I.
 
THE
INTRODUCTION
.
  
<EOS>
Whoever
has
an
ambition
to
be
heard
in
a
crowd
must
press
,
and
squeeze
,
and
thrust
,
and
climb
with
indefatigable
pains
,
till
he
has
exalted
himself
to
a
certain
degree
of
altitude
above
them
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
in
all
assemblies
,
though
you
wedge
them
ever
so
close
,
we
may
observe
this
peculiar
property
,
that
over
their
heads
there
is
room
enough
;
but
how
to
reach
it
is
the
difficult
point
,
it
being
as
hard
to
get
quit
of
number
as
of
hell
.
  
<EOS>
"
 
Evadere
ad
auras
,
Hoc
opus
,
hic
labor
est
.
"
   
<EOS>
To
this
end
the
philosopher
's
way
in
all
ages
has
been
by
erecting
certain
edifices
in
the
air
;
but
whatever
practice
and
reputation
these
kind
of
structures
have
formerly
possessed
,
or
may
still
continue
in
,
not
excepting
even
that
of
Socrates
when
he
was
suspended
in
a
basket
to
help
contemplation
,
I
think
,
with
due
submission
,
they
seem
to
labour
under
two
inconveniences
.
 
<EOS>
First
,
that
the
foundations
being
laid
too
high
,
they
have
been
often
out
of
sight
and
ever
out
of
hearing
.
 
<EOS>
Secondly
,
that
the
materials
being
very
transitory
,
have
suffered
much
from
inclemencies
of
air
,
especially
in
these
north
-
west
regions
.
  
<EOS>
Therefore
,
towards
the
just
performance
of
this
great
work
there
remain
but
three
methods
that
I
can
think
on
;
whereof
the
wisdom
of
our
ancestors
being
highly
sensible
,
has
,
to
encourage
all
aspiring
adventures
,
thought
fit
to
erect
three
wooden
machines
for
the
use
of
those
orators
who
desire
to
talk
much
without
interruption
.
<EOS>
These
are
the
Pulpit
,
the
Ladder
,
and
the
Stage
-
itinerant
.
 
<EOS>
For
as
to
the
Bar
,
though
it
be
compounded
of
the
same
matter
and
designed
for
the
same
use
,
it
can
not
,
however
,
be
well
allowed
the
honour
of
a
fourth
,
by
reason
of
its
level
or
inferior
situation
exposing
it
to
perpetual
interruption
from
collaterals
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
can
the
Bench
itself
,
though
raised
to
a
proper
eminency
,
put
in
a
better
claim
,
whatever
its
advocates
insist
on
.
 
<EOS>
For
if
they
please
to
look
into
the
original
design
of
its
erection
,
and
the
circumstances
or
adjuncts
subservient
to
that
design
,
they
will
soon
acknowledge
the
present
practice
exactly
correspondent
to
the
primitive
institution
,
and
both
to
answer
the
etymology
of
the
name
,
which
in
the
Phoenician
tongue
is
a
word
of
great
signification
,
importing
,
if
literally
interpreted
,
"
The
place
of
sleep
,
"
but
in
common
acceptation
,
"
A
seat
well
bolstered
and
cushioned
,
for
the
repose
of
old
and
gouty
limbs
;
"
senes
ut
in
otia
<EOS>
tuta
recedant
.
 
<EOS>
Fortune
being
indebted
to
them
this
part
of
retaliation
,
that
as
formerly
they
have
long
talked
whilst
others
slept
,
so
now
they
may
sleep
as
long
whilst
others
talk
.
  
<EOS>
But
if
no
other
argument
could
occur
to
exclude
the
Bench
and
the
Bar
from
the
list
of
oratorical
machines
,
it
were
sufficient
that
the
admission
of
them
would
overthrow
a
number
which
I
was
resolved
to
establish
<EOS>
,
whatever
argument
it
might
cost
me
;
in
imitation
of
that
prudent
method
observed
by
many
other
philosophers
and
great
clerks
,
whose
chief
art
in
division
has
been
to
grow
fond
of
some
proper
mystical
number
,
which
their
imaginations
have
rendered
sacred
to
a
degree
that
they
force
common
reason
to
find
room
for
it
in
every
part
of
Nature
,
reducing
,
including
,
and
adjusting
,
every
genus
and
species
within
that
compass
by
coupling
some
against
their
wills
and
banishing
others
at
any
rate
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
among
all
the
rest
,
the
profound
number
THREE
 
is
that
which
has
most
employed
my
sublimest
speculations
,
nor
ever
without
wonderful
delight
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
now
in
the
press
,
and
will
be
published
next
term
,
a
panegyrical
essay
of
mine
upon
this
number
,
wherein
I
have
,
by
most
convincing
proofs
,
not
only
reduced
the
senses
and
the
elements
under
its
banner
,
but
brought
over
several
deserters
from
its
two
great
rivals
,
SEVEN
and
NINE
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
the
first
of
these
oratorical
machines
,
in
place
as
well
as
dignity
,
is
the
Pulpit
.
 
<EOS>
Of
pulpits
<EOS>
there
are
in
this
island
several
sorts
,
but
I
esteem
only
that
made
of
timber
from
the
Sylva
Caledonia
,
which
agrees
very
well
with
our
climate
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
be
upon
its
decay
,
it
is
the
better
,
both
for
conveyance
of
sound
and
for
other
reasons
to
be
mentioned
by
and
by
.
 
<EOS>
The
degree
of
perfection
in
shape
and
size
I
take
to
consist
in
being
extremely
narrow
,
with
little
ornament
,
and
,
best
of
all
,
without
a
cover
;
for
,
by
ancient
rule
,
it
ought
to
be
the
only
uncovered
vessel
in
every
assembly
where
it
is
rightfully
used
,
by
which
means
,
from
its
near
resemblance
to
a
pillory
,
it
will
ever
have
a
mighty
influence
on
human
ears
.
  
<EOS>
Of
Ladders
<EOS>
I
need
say
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
observed
by
foreigners
themselves
,
to
the
honour
of
our
country
,
that
we
excel
all
nations
in
our
practice
and
understanding
of
this
machine
.
 
<EOS>
The
ascending
orators
do
not
only
oblige
their
audience
in
the
agreeable
delivery
,
but
the
whole
world
in
their
early
publication
of
their
speeches
,
which
I
look
upon
as
the
choicest
treasury
of
our
British
eloquence
,
and
whereof
I
am
informed
that
worthy
citizen
and
bookseller
,
Mr.
John
Dunton
,
has
made
a
faithful
and
a
painful
collection
,
which
he
shortly
designs
to
publish
in
twelve
volumes
in
folio
,
illustrated
with
copper
-
plates
,
 
a
work
highly
useful
and
curious
,
and
altogether
worthy
of
such
a
hand
.
  
<EOS>
The
last
engine
of
orators
is
the
Stage
-
itinerant
,
erected
with
much
sagacity
,
sub
Jove
pluvio
,
in
triviis
et
quadriviis
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
the
great
seminary
of
the
two
former
,
and
its
orators
are
sometimes
preferred
to
the
one
and
sometimes
to
the
other
,
in
proportion
to
their
deservings
,
there
being
a
strict
and
perpetual
intercourse
between
all
three
.
  
<EOS>
From
this
accurate
deduction
it
is
manifest
that
for
obtaining
attention
in
public
there
is
of
necessity
required
a
superior
position
of
place
.
 
<EOS>
But
although
this
point
be
generally
granted
,
yet
the
cause
is
little
agreed
in
;
and
it
seems
to
me
that
very
few
philosophers
have
fallen
into
a
true
natural
solution
of
this
phenomenon
.
 
<EOS>
The
deepest
account
,
and
the
most
fairly
digested
of
any
I
have
yet
met
with
is
this
,
that
air
being
a
heavy
body
,
and
therefore
,
according
to
the
system
of
Epicurus
,
continually
descending
<EOS>
,
must
needs
be
more
so
when
laden
and
pressed
down
by
words
,
which
are
also
bodies
of
much
weight
and
gravity
,
as
is
manifest
from
those
deep
impressions
they
make
and
leave
upon
us
,
and
therefore
must
be
delivered
from
a
due
altitude
,
or
else
they
will
neither
carry
a
good
aim
nor
fall
down
with
a
sufficient
force
.
  
<EOS>
"
Corpoream

vocem

Et

impellere

"

<EOS>

.
   
<EOS>
And
I
am
the
readier
to
favour
this
conjecture
from
a
common
observation
<EOS>
,
that
in
the
several
assemblies
of
these
orators
Nature
itself
has
instructed
the
hearers
to
stand
with
their
mouths
open
and
erected
parallel
to
the
horizon
,
so
as
they
may
be
intersected
by
a
perpendicular
line
from
the
zenith
to
the
centre
of
the
earth
.
<EOS>
In
which
position
,
if
the
audience
be
well
compact
,
every
one
carries
home
a
share
,
and
little
or
nothing
is
lost
.
  
<EOS>
I
confess
there
is
something
yet
more
refined
in
the
contrivance
and
structure
of
our
modern
theatres
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
first
,
the
pit
is
sunk
below
the
stage
with
due
regard
to
the
institution
above
deduced
,
that
whatever
weighty
matter
shall
be
delivered
thence
,
whether
it
be
lead
or
gold
,
<EOS>
may
fall
plump
into
the
jaws
of
certain
critics
,
as
I
think
they
are
called
,
which
stand
ready
open
to
devour
them
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
boxes
are
built
round
and
raised
to
a
level
with
the
scene
,
in
deference
to
the
ladies
,
because
that
large
portion
of
wit
laid
out
in
raising
pruriences
and
protuberances
is
observed
to
run
much
upon
a
line
,
and
ever
in
a
circle
.
 
<EOS>
The
whining
passions
and
little
starved
conceits
are
gently
wafted
up
by
their
own
extreme
levity
to
the
middle
region
,
and
there
fix
and
are
frozen
by
the
frigid
understandings
of
the
inhabitants
.
 
<EOS>
Bombast
and
buffoonery
,
by
nature
lofty
and
light
,
soar
highest
of
all
,
and
would
be
lost
in
the
roof
if
the
prudent
architect
had
not
,
with
much
foresight
,
contrived
for
them
a
fourth
place
,
called
the
twelve
-
penny
gallery
,
and
there
planted
a
suitable
colony
,
who
greedily
intercept
them
in
their
passage
.
  
<EOS>
Now
this
physico
-
logical
scheme
of
oratorical
receptacles
or
machines
contains
a
great
mystery
,
being
a
type
,
a
sign
,
an
emblem
,
a
shadow
,
a
symbol
,
bearing
analogy
to
the
spacious
commonwealth
of
writers
and
to
those
methods
by
which
they
must
exalt
themselves
to
a
certain
eminency
above
the
inferior
world
.
 
<EOS>
By
the
Pulpit
are
adumbrated
the
writings
of
our
modern
saints
in
Great
Britain
,
as
they
have
spiritualised
and
refined
them
from
the
dross
and
grossness
of
sense
and
human
reason
.
 
<EOS>
The
matter
,
as
we
have
said
,
is
of
rotten
wood
,
and
that
upon
two
considerations
:
 
because
it
is
the
quality
of
rotten
wood
to
light
in
the
dark
;
and
secondly
,
because
its
cavities
are
full
of
worms
 
which
is
a
type
with
a
pair
of
handles
,
having
a
respect
to
the
two
principal
qualifications
of
the
orator
and
the
two
different
fates
attending
upon
his
works
.
   
<EOS>
The
Ladder
is
an
adequate
symbol
of
faction
and
of
poetry
,
to
both
of
which
so
noble
a
number
of
authors
are
indebted
for
their
fame
.
<EOS>
Of
faction
,
because
.(Hiatus
in
MS
.
)
.
 
<EOS>
Of
poetry
,
because
its
orators
do
perorare
with
a
song
;
and
because
,
climbing
up
by
slow
degrees
,
fate
is
sure
to
turn
them
off
before
they
can
reach
within
many
steps
of
the
top
;
and
because
it
is
a
preferment
attained
by
transferring
of
propriety
and
a
confounding
of
meum
and
tuum
.
  
<EOS>
Under
the
Stage
-
itinerant
are
couched
those
productions
designed
for
the
pleasure
and
delight
of
mortal
man
,
such
as
"
Six
Pennyworth
of
Wit
,
"
"
Westminster
Drolleries
,
"
"
Delightful
Tales
,
"
"
Complete
Jesters
,
"
and
the
like
,
by
which
the
writers
of
and
for
Grub
Street
<EOS>
have
in
these
later
ages
so
nobly
triumphed
over
time
,
have
clipped
his
wings
,
pared
his
nails
,
filed
his
teeth
,
turned
back
his
hour
-
glass
,
blunted
his
scythe
,
and
drawn
the
hobnails
out
of
his
shoes
.
<EOS>
It
is
under
this
class
I
have
presumed
to
list
my
present
treatise
,
<EOS>
being
just
come
from
having
the
honour
conferred
upon
me
to
be
adopted
a
member
of
that
illustrious
fraternity
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
I
am
not
unaware
how
the
productions
of
the
Grub
Street
brotherhood
have
of
late
years
fallen
under
many
prejudices
,
nor
how
it
has
been
the
perpetual
employment
of
two
junior
start
-
up
societies
to
ridicule
them
and
their
authors
as
unworthy
their
established
post
in
the
commonwealth
of
wit
and
learning
.
 
<EOS>
Their
own
consciences
will
easily
inform
them
whom
I
mean
;
nor
has
the
world
been
so
negligent
a
looker
-
on
as
not
to
observe
the
continual
efforts
made
by
the
societies
of
Gresham
and
of
Will
's
,
to
edify
a
name
and
reputation
upon
the
ruin
of
ours
.
 
<EOS>
And
this
is
yet
a
more
feeling
grief
to
us
,
upon
the
regards
of
tenderness
as
well
as
of
justice
,
when
we
reflect
on
their
proceedings
not
only
as
unjust
,
but
as
ungrateful
,
undutiful
,
and
unnatural
.
 
<EOS>
For
how
can
it
be
forgot
by
the
world
or
themselves
,
to
say
nothing
of
our
own
records
,
which
are
full
and
clear
in
the
point
,
that
they
both
are
seminaries
,
not
only
of
our
planting
,
but
our
watering
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
informed
our
two
rivals
have
lately
made
an
offer
to
enter
into
the
lists
with
united
forces
and
challenge
us
to
a
comparison
of
books
,
both
as
to
weight
and
number
.
 
<EOS>
In
return
to
which
,
with
license
from
our
president
,
I
humbly
offer
two
answers
.
 
<EOS>
First
,
we
say
the
proposal
is
like
that
which
Archimedes
made
upon
a
smaller
affair
,
including
an
impossibility
in
the
practice
;
for
where
can
they
find
scales
of
capacity
enough
for
the
first
,
or
an
arithmetician
of
capacity
enough
for
the
second
.
 
<EOS>
Secondly
,
we
are
ready
to
accept
the
challenge
,
but
with
this
condition
,
that
a
third
indifferent
person
be
assigned
,
to
whose
impartial
judgment
it
shall
be
left
to
decide
which
society
each
book
,
treatise
,
or
pamphlet
do
most
properly
belong
to
.
 
<EOS>
This
point
,
God
knows
,
is
very
far
from
being
fixed
at
present
,
for
we
are
ready
to
produce
a
catalogue
of
some
thousands
which
in
all
common
justice
ought
to
be
entitled
to
our
fraternity
,
but
by
the
revolted
and
newfangled
writers
most
perfidiously
ascribed
to
the
others
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
all
which
we
think
it
very
unbecoming
our
prudence
that
the
determination
should
be
remitted
to
the
authors
themselves
,
when
our
adversaries
by
briguing
and
caballing
have
caused
so
universal
a
defection
from
us
,
that
the
greatest
part
of
our
society
has
already
deserted
to
them
,
and
our
nearest
friends
begin
to
stand
aloof
,
as
if
they
were
half
ashamed
to
own
us
.
  
<EOS>
This
is
the
utmost
I
am
authorised
to
say
upon
so
ungrateful
and
melancholy
a
subject
,
because
we
are
extremely
unwilling
to
inflame
a
controversy
whose
continuance
may
be
so
fatal
to
the
interests
of
us
all
,
desiring
much
rather
that
things
be
amicably
composed
;
and
we
shall
so
far
advance
on
our
side
as
to
be
ready
to
receive
the
two
prodigals
with
open
arms
whenever
they
shall
think
fit
to
return
from
their
husks
and
their
harlots
,
which
I
think
,
from
the
present
course
of
their
studies
,
they
most
properly
may
be
said
to
be
engaged
in
,
and
,
like
an
indulgent
parent
,
continue
to
them
our
affection
and
our
blessing
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
greatest
maim
given
to
that
general
reception
which
the
writings
of
our
society
have
formerly
received
,
next
to
the
transitory
state
of
all
sublunary
things
,
has
been
a
superficial
vein
among
many
readers
of
the
present
age
,
who
will
by
no
means
be
persuaded
to
inspect
beyond
the
surface
and
the
rind
of
things
;
whereas
wisdom
is
a
fox
,
who
,
after
long
hunting
,
will
at
last
cost
you
the
pains
to
dig
out
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
cheese
which
,
by
how
much
the
richer
,
has
the
thicker
,
the
homelier
,
and
the
coarser
coat
,
and
whereof
to
a
judicious
palate
the
maggots
are
the
best
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
sack
-
posset
,
wherein
the
deeper
you
go
you
will
find
it
the
sweeter
.
<EOS>
Wisdom
is
a
hen
whose
cackling
we
must
value
and
consider
,
because
it
is
attended
with
an
egg
.
 
<EOS>
But
then
,
lastly
,
it
is
a
nut
,
which
,
unless
you
choose
with
judgment
,
may
cost
you
a
tooth
,
and
pay
you
with
nothing
but
a
worm
.
 
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
these
momentous
truths
,
the
Grubaean
sages
have
always
chosen
to
convey
their
precepts
and
their
arts
shut
up
within
the
vehicles
of
types
and
fables
;
which
having
been
perhaps
more
careful
and
curious
in
adorning
than
was
altogether
necessary
,
it
has
fared
with
these
vehicles
after
the
usual
fate
of
coaches
over
-
finely
painted
and
gilt
,
that
the
transitory
gazers
have
so
dazzled
their
eyes
and
filled
their
imaginations
with
the
outward
lustre
,
as
neither
to
regard
nor
consider
the
person
or
the
parts
of
the
owner
within
.
 
<EOS>
A
misfortune
we
undergo
with
somewhat
less
reluctancy
,
because
it
has
been
common
to
us
with
Pythagoras
,
AEsop
,
Socrates
,
and
other
of
our
predecessors
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
that
neither
the
world
nor
ourselves
may
any
longer
suffer
by
such
misunderstandings
,
I
have
been
prevailed
on
,
after
much
importunity
from
my
friends
,
to
travail
in
a
complete
and
laborious
dissertation
upon
the
prime
productions
of
our
society
,
which
,
besides
their
beautiful
externals
for
the
gratification
of
superficial
readers
,
have
darkly
and
deeply
couched
under
them
the
most
finished
and
refined
systems
of
all
sciences
and
arts
,
as
I
do
not
doubt
to
lay
open
by
untwisting
or
unwinding
,
and
either
to
draw
up
by
exantlation
or
display
by
incision
.
  
<EOS>
This
great
work
was
entered
upon
some
years
ago
by
one
of
our
most
eminent
members
.
 
<EOS>
He
began
with
the
"
History
of
Reynard
the
Fox
,
"
but
neither
lived
to
publish
his
essay
nor
to
proceed
farther
in
so
useful
an
attempt
,
which
is
very
much
to
be
lamented
,
because
the
discovery
he
made
and
communicated
to
his
friends
is
now
universally
received
;
nor
do
I
think
any
of
the
learned
will
dispute
that
famous
treatise
to
be
a
complete
body
of
civil
knowledge
,
and
the
revelation
,
or
rather
the
apocalypse
,
of
all
state
arcana
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
progress
I
have
made
is
much
greater
,
having
already
finished
my
annotations
upon
several
dozens
from
some
of
which
I
shall
impart
a
few
hints
to
the
candid
reader
,
as
far
as
will
be
necessary
to
the
conclusion
at
which
I
aim
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
piece
I
have
handled
is
that
of
"
Tom
Thumb
,
"
whose
author
was
a
Pythagorean
philosopher
.
 
<EOS>
This
dark
treatise
contains
the
whole
scheme
of
the
metempsychosis
,
deducing
the
progress
of
the
soul
through
all
her
stages
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
is
"
Dr.
Faustus
,
"
penned
by
Artephius
,
an
author
bonae
notae
and
an
adeptus
;
he
published
it
in
the
nine
hundred
and
eighty
-
fourth
year
 
of
his
age
;
this
writer
proceeds
wholly
by
reincrudation
,
or
in
the
via
humida
;
and
the
marriage
between
Faustus
and
Helen
does
most
conspicuously
dilucidate
the
fermenting
of
the
male
and
female
dragon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Whittington
and
his
Cat
"
is
the
work
of
that
mysterious
Rabbi
,
Jehuda
Hannasi
,
containing
a
defence
of
the
Gemara
of
the
Jerusalem
Misna
,
and
its
just
preference
to
that
of
Babylon
,
contrary
to
the
vulgar
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
Hind
and
Panther
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
masterpiece
of
a
famous
writer
now
living
,
intended
for
a
complete
abstract
of
sixteen
thousand
schoolmen
from
Scotus
to
Bellarmine
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tommy
Potts
.
"
 
<EOS>
Another
piece
,
supposed
by
the
same
hand
,
by
way
of
supplement
to
the
former
.
  
<EOS>
The
"
Wise
Men
of
Gotham
,
"
cum
Appendice
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
a
treatise
of
immense
erudition
,
being
the
great
original
and
fountain
of
those
arguments
bandied
about
both
in
France
and
England
,
for
a
just
defence
of
modern
learning
and
wit
,
against
the
presumption
,
the
pride
,
and
the
ignorance
of
the
ancients
.
 
<EOS>
This
unknown
author
hath
so
exhausted
the
subject
,
that
a
penetrating
reader
will
easily
discover
whatever
has
been
written
since
upon
that
dispute
to
be
little
more
than
repetition
.
 
<EOS>
An
abstract
of
this
treatise
has
been
lately
published
by
a
worthy
member
of
our
society
.
  
<EOS>
These
notices
may
serve
to
give
the
learned
reader
an
idea
as
well
as
a
taste
of
what
the
whole
work
is
likely
to
produce
,
wherein
I
have
now
altogether
circumscribed
my
thoughts
and
my
studies
;
and
if
I
can
bring
it
to
a
perfection
before
I
die
,
shall
reckon
I
have
well
employed
the
poor
remains
of
an
unfortunate
life
.
 
<EOS>
This
indeed
is
more
than
I
can
justly
expect
from
a
quill
worn
to
the
pith
in
the
service
of
the
State
,
in
pros
and
cons
upon
Popish
Plots
,
and
Meal
Tubs
,
and
Exclusion
Bills
,
and
Passive
Obedience
,
and
Addresses
of
Lives
and
Fortunes
;
and
Prerogative
,
and
Property
,
and
Liberty
of
Conscience
,
and
Letters
to
a
Friend
:
 
from
an
understanding
and
a
conscience
,
threadbare
and
ragged
with
perpetual
turning
;
from
a
head
broken
in
a
hundred
places
by
the
malignants
of
the
opposite
factions
,
and
from
a
body
spent
with
poxes
ill
cured
,
by
trusting
to
bawds
and
surgeons
,
who
(
as
it
afterwards
appeared
)
were
professed
enemies
to
me
and
the
Government
,
and
revenged
their
party
's
quarrel
upon
my
nose
and
shins
.
 
<EOS>
Fourscore
and
eleven
pamphlets
<EOS>
have
I
written
under
three
reigns
,
and
for
the
service
of
six
-
and
-
thirty
factions
.
 
<EOS>
But
finding
the
State
has
no
farther
occasion
for
me
and
my
ink
<EOS>
,
I
retire
willingly
to
draw
it
out
into
speculations
more
becoming
a
philosopher
,
having
,
to
my
unspeakable
comfort
,
<EOS>
passed
a
long
life
with
a
conscience
void
of
offence
towards
God
and
towards
men
.
  
<EOS>
But
to
return
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
assured
from
the
reader
's
candour
that
the
brief
specimen
I
have
given
will
easily
clear
all
the
rest
of
our
society
's
productions
from
an
aspersion
grown
,
as
it
is
manifest
,
out
of
envy
and
ignorance
,
that
they
are
of
little
farther
use
or
value
to
mankind
beyond
the
common
entertainments
of
their
wit
and
their
style
;
for
these
I
am
sure
have
never
yet
been
disputed
by
our
keenest
adversaries
;
in
both
which
,
as
well
as
the
more
profound
and
most
mystical
part
,
I
have
throughout
this
treatise
closely
followed
the
most
applauded
originals
.
 
<EOS>
And
to
render
all
complete
I
have
with
much
thought
and
application
of
mind
<EOS>
so
ordered
that
the
chief
title
prefixed
to
it
(
I
mean
that
under
which
I
design
it
shall
pass
in
the
common
conversation
of
court
and
town
)
<EOS>
is
modelled
exactly
after
the
manner
peculiar
to
our
society
.
  
<EOS>
I
confess
to
have
been
somewhat
liberal
in
the
business
of
titles
,
having
observed
the
humour
of
multiplying
them
,
to
bear
great
vogue
among
certain
writers
,
whom
I
exceedingly
reverence
.
 
<EOS>
And
indeed
it
seems
not
unreasonable
that
books
,
the
children
of
the
brain
,
should
have
the
honour
to
be
christened
with
variety
of
names
,
as
well
as
other
infants
of
quality
.
 
<EOS>
Our
famous
Dryden
has
ventured
to
proceed
a
point
farther
,
endeavouring
to
introduce
also
a
multiplicity
of
godfathers
,
which
is
an
improvement
of
much
more
advantage
,
upon
a
very
obvious
account
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
pity
this
admirable
invention
has
not
been
better
cultivated
,
so
as
to
grow
by
this
time
into
general
imitation
,
when
such
an
authority
serves
it
for
a
precedent
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
have
my
endeavours
been
wanting
to
second
<EOS>
so
useful
an
example
,
but
it
seems
there
is
an
unhappy
expense
usually
annexed
to
the
calling
of
a
godfather
,
which
was
clearly
out
of
my
head
,
as
it
is
very
reasonable
to
believe
.
 
<EOS>
Where
the
pinch
lay
,
I
can
not
certainly
affirm
;
but
having
employed
a
world
of
thoughts
and
pains
to
split
my
treatise
into
forty
sections
,
and
having
entreated
forty
Lords
of
my
acquaintance
that
they
would
do
me
the
honour
to
stand
,
they
all
made
it
matter
of
conscience
,
and
sent
me
their
excuses
.
  
<EOS>
SECTION
II
.
  
<EOS>
Once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
man
who
had
three
sons
by
one
wife
 
and
all
at
a
birth
,
neither
could
the
midwife
tell
certainly
which
was
the
eldest
.
 
<EOS>
Their
father
died
while
they
were
young
,
and
upon
his
death
-
bed
,
calling
the
lads
to
him
,
spoke
thus
:
    
"
Sons
,
because
I
have
purchased
no
estate
,
nor
was
born
to
any
,
I
have
long
considered
of
some
good
legacies
to
bequeath
you
,
and
at
last
,
with
much
care
as
well
as
expense
,
have
provided
each
of
you
(
here
they
are
)
a
new
coat
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
you
are
to
understand
that
these
coats
have
two
virtues
contained
in
them
;
one
is
,
that
with
good
wearing
they
will
last
you
fresh
and
sound
as
long
as
you
live
;
the
other
is
,
that
they
will
grow
in
the
same
proportion
with
your
bodies
,
lengthening
and
widening
of
themselves
,
so
as
to
be
always
fit
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
let
me
see
them
on
you
before
I
die
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
very
well
!
<EOS>
Pray
,
children
,
wear
them
clean
and
brush
them
often
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
find
in
my
will
(
here
it
is
)
full
instructions
in
every
particular
concerning
the
wearing
and
management
of
your
coats
,
wherein
you
must
be
very
exact
to
avoid
the
penalties
I
have
appointed
for
every
transgression
or
neglect
,
upon
which
your
future
fortunes
will
entirely
depend
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
also
commanded
in
my
will
that
you
should
live
together
in
one
house
like
brethren
and
friends
,
for
then
you
will
be
sure
to
thrive
and
not
otherwise
.
"
  
<EOS>
Here
the
story
says
this
good
father
died
,
and
the
three
sons
went
all
together
to
seek
their
fortunes
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
not
trouble
you
with
recounting
what
adventures
they
met
for
the
first
seven
years
,
any
farther
than
by
taking
notice
that
they
carefully
observed
their
father
's
will
and
kept
their
coats
in
very
good
order
;
that
they
travelled
through
several
countries
,
encountered
a
reasonable
quantity
of
giants
,
and
slew
certain
dragons
.
  
<EOS>
Being
now
arrived
at
the
proper
age
for
producing
themselves
,
they
came
up
to
town
and
fell
in
love
with
the
ladies
,
but
especially
three
,
who
about
that
time
were
in
chief
reputation
,
the
Duchess
d'Argent
,
Madame
de
Grands
-
Titres
,
and
the
Countess
d'Orgueil
.
<EOS>
On
their
first
appearance
,
our
three
adventurers
met
with
a
very
bad
reception
,
and
soon
with
great
sagacity
guessing
out
the
reason
,
they
quickly
began
to
improve
in
the
good
qualities
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
They
wrote
,
and
rallied
,
and
rhymed
,
and
sung
,
and
said
,
and
said
nothing
;
they
drank
,
and
fought
,
and
slept
,
and
swore
,
and
took
snuff
;
they
went
to
new
plays
on
the
first
night
,
haunted
the
chocolate
-
houses
,
beat
the
watch
;
they
bilked
hackney
-
coachmen
,
ran
in
debt
with
shopkeepers
,
and
lay
with
their
wives
;
they
killed
bailiffs
,
kicked
fiddlers
down
-
stairs
,
ate
at
Locket
's
,
loitered
at
Will
's
;
they
talked
of
the
drawing
-
room
and
never
came
there
;
dined
with
lords
they
never
saw
;
whispered
a
duchess
and
spoke
never
a
word
;
exposed
the
scrawls
of
their
laundress
for
billet
-
doux
of
quality
;
came
ever
just
from
court
and
were
never
seen
in
it
;
attended
the
levee
sub
dio
;
got
a
list
of
peers
by
heart
in
one
company
,
and
with
great
familiarity
retailed
them
in
another
.
 
<EOS>
Above
all
,
they
constantly
attended
those
committees
of
Senators
who
are
silent
in
the
House
and
loud
in
the
coffeehouse
,
where
they
nightly
adjourn
to
chew
the
cud
of
politics
,
and
are
encompassed
with
a
ring
of
disciples
who
lie
in
wait
to
catch
up
their
droppings
.
 
<EOS>
The
three
brothers
had
acquired
forty
other
qualifications
of
the
like
stamp
too
tedious
to
recount
,
and
by
consequence
were
justly
reckoned
the
most
accomplished
persons
in
town
.
 
<EOS>
But
all
would
not
suffice
,
and
the
ladies
aforesaid
continued
still
inflexible
.
 
<EOS>
To
clear
up
which
difficulty
,
I
must
,
with
the
reader
's
good
leave
and
patience
,
have
recourse
to
some
points
of
weight
which
the
authors
of
that
age
have
not
sufficiently
illustrated
.
  
<EOS>
For
about
this
time
it
happened
a
sect
arose
whose
tenets
obtained
and
spread
very
far
,
especially
in
the
grand
monde
,
and
among
everybody
of
good
fashion
.
 
<EOS>
They
worshipped
a
sort
of
idol
,
who
,
as
their
doctrine
delivered
,
did
daily
create
men
by
a
kind
of
manufactory
operation
.
 
<EOS>
This
idol
they
placed
in
the
highest
parts
of
the
house
on
an
altar
erected
about
three
feet
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
shown
in
the
posture
of
a
Persian
emperor
sitting
on
a
superficies
with
his
legs
interwoven
under
him
.
 
<EOS>
This
god
had
a
goose
for
his
ensign
,
whence
<EOS>
it
is
that
some
learned
men
pretend
to
deduce
his
original
from
Jupiter
Capitolinus
.
 
<EOS>
At
his
left
hand
,
beneath
the
altar
,
Hell
seemed
to
open
and
catch
at
the
animals
the
idol
was
creating
,
to
prevent
which
,
certain
of
his
priests
hourly
flung
in
pieces
of
the
uninformed
mass
or
substance
,
and
sometimes
whole
limbs
already
enlivened
,
which
that
horrid
gulph
insatiably
swallowed
,
terrible
to
behold
.
 
<EOS>
The
goose
was
also
held
a
subaltern
divinity
or
Deus
minorum
gentium
,
before
whose
shrine
was
sacrificed
that
creature
whose
hourly
food
is
human
gore
,
and
who
is
in
so
great
renown
abroad
for
being
the
delight
and
favourite
of
the
Egyptian
Cercopithecus
.
 
<EOS>
Millions
of
these
animals
were
cruelly
slaughtered
every
day
to
appease
the
hunger
of
that
consuming
deity
.
<EOS>
The
chief
idol
was
also
worshipped
as
the
inventor
of
the
yard
and
the
needle
,
whether
as
the
god
of
seamen
,
or
on
account
of
certain
other
mystical
attributes
,
hath
not
been
sufficiently
cleared
.
  
<EOS>
The
worshippers
of
this
deity
had
also
a
system
of
their
belief
which
seemed
to
turn
upon
the
following
fundamental
.
 
<EOS>
They
held
the
universe
to
be
a
large
suit
of
clothes
which
invests
everything
;
that
the
earth
is
invested
by
the
air
;
the
air
is
invested
by
the
stars
;
and
the
stars
are
invested
by
the
Primum
Mobile
.
 
<EOS>
Look
on
this
globe
of
earth
,
you
will
find
it
to
be
a
very
complete
and
fashionable
dress
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
that
which
some
call
land
but
<EOS>
a
fine
coat
faced
with
green
,
or
the
sea
but
a
waistcoat
of
water
-
tabby
?
<EOS>
Proceed
to
the
particular
works
of
the
creation
,
you
will
find
how
curious
journeyman
Nature
hath
been
to
trim
up
the
vegetable
beaux
;
observe
how
sparkish
a
periwig
adorns
the
head
of
a
beech
,
and
what
a
fine
doublet
of
white
satin
is
worn
by
the
birch
.
 
<EOS>
To
conclude
from
all
,
what
is
man
himself
but
a
microcoat
,
or
rather
a
complete
suit
of
clothes
with
all
its
trimmings
?
 
<EOS>
As
to
his
body
there
can
be
no
dispute
,
but
examine
even
the
acquirements
of
his
mind
,
you
will
find
them
all
contribute
in
their
order
towards
furnishing
out
an
exact
dress
.
 
<EOS>
To
instance
no
more
,
is
not
religion
a
cloak
,
honesty
a
pair
of
shoes
worn
out
in
the
dirt
,
<EOS>
self
-
love
a
surtout
,
vanity
a
shirt
,
and
conscience
a
pair
of
breeches
,
which
,
though
a
cover
for
lewdness
as
well
as
nastiness
,
is
easily
slipped
down
for
the
service
of
both
.
  
<EOS>
These
postulata
being
admitted
,
it
will
follow
in
due
course
of
reasoning
that
those
beings
which
the
world
calls
improperly
suits
of
clothes
are
in
reality
the
most
refined
species
of
animals
,
or
to
proceed
higher
,
that
they
are
rational
creatures
or
men
.
 
<EOS>
For
is
it
not
manifest
that
they
live
,
and
move
,
and
talk
,
and
perform
all
other
offices
of
human
life
?
 
<EOS>
Are
not
beauty
,
and
wit
,
and
mien
,
and
breeding
their
inseparable
proprieties
?
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
we
see
nothing
but
them
,
hear
nothing
but
them
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
not
they
who
walk
the
streets
,
fill
up
Parliament-
,
coffee-
,
play-
,
bawdy
-
houses
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
true
,
indeed
,
that
these
animals
,
which
are
vulgarly
called
suits
of
clothes
or
dresses
,
do
according
to
certain
compositions
receive
different
appellations
.
 
<EOS>
If
one
of
them
be
trimmed
up
with
a
gold
chain
,
and
a
red
gown
,
and
a
white
rod
,
and
a
great
horse
,
it
is
called
a
Lord
Mayor
;
if
certain
ermines
and
furs
be
placed
in
a
certain
position
,
we
style
them
a
judge
,
and
so
an
apt
conjunction
of
lawn
and
black
satin
we
entitle
a
Bishop
.
  
<EOS>
Others
of
these
professors
,
though
agreeing
in
the
main
system
,
were
yet
more
refined
upon
certain
branches
of
it
;
and
held
that
man
was
an
animal
compounded
of
two
dresses
,
the
natural
and
the
celestial
suit
,
which
were
the
body
and
the
soul
;
that
the
soul
was
the
outward
,
and
the
body
the
inward
clothing
;
that
the
latter
was
ex
traduce
,
but
the
former
of
daily
creation
and
circumfusion
.
 
<EOS>
This
last
they
proved
by
Scripture
,
because
in
them
we
live
,
and
move
,
and
have
our
being
:
 
as
likewise
by
philosophy
,
because
they
are
all
in
all
,
and
all
in
every
part
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
said
they
,
separate
these
two
,
and
you
will
find
the
body
to
be
only
a
senseless
unsavoury
carcass
.
 
<EOS>
By
all
which
it
is
manifest
that
the
outward
dress
must
needs
be
the
soul
.
  
<EOS>
To
this
system
of
religion
were
tagged
several
subaltern
doctrines
,
which
were
entertained
with
great
vogue
;
as
particularly
the
faculties
of
the
mind
were
deduced
by
the
learned
among
them
in
this
manner
:
 
<EOS>
embroidery
was
sheer
wit
,
gold
fringe
was
agreeable
conversation
,
gold
lace
was
repartee
,
a
huge
long
periwig
was
humour
,
and
a
coat
full
of
powder
was
very
good
raillery
.
 
<EOS>
All
which
required
abundance
of
finesse
and
delicatesse
to
manage
with
advantage
,
as
well
as
a
strict
observance
after
times
and
fashions
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
with
much
pains
and
reading
collected
out
of
ancient
authors
this
short
summary
of
a
body
of
philosophy
and
divinity
which
seems
to
have
been
composed
by
a
vein
and
race
of
thinking
very
different
from
any
other
systems
,
either
ancient
or
modern
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
was
not
merely
to
entertain
or
satisfy
the
reader
's
curiosity
,
but
rather
to
give
him
light
into
several
circumstances
of
the
following
story
,
that
,
knowing
the
state
of
dispositions
and
opinions
in
an
age
so
remote
,
he
may
better
comprehend
those
great
events
which
were
the
issue
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
advise
,
therefore
,
the
courteous
reader
to
peruse
with
a
world
of
application
,
again
and
again
,
<EOS>
whatever
I
have
written
upon
this
matter
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
leaving
these
broken
ends
,
I
carefully
gather
up
the
chief
thread
of
my
story
,
and
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
These
opinions
,
therefore
,
were
so
universal
,
as
well
as
the
practices
of
them
,
among
the
refined
part
of
court
and
town
,
that
our
three
brother
adventurers
,
as
their
circumstances
then
stood
,
were
strangely
at
a
loss
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
on
the
one
side
,
the
three
ladies
they
addressed
themselves
to
(
whom
we
have
named
already
)
were
ever
at
the
very
top
of
the
fashion
,
and
abhorred
all
that
were
below
it
but
the
breadth
of
a
hair
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
other
side
,
their
father
's
will
was
very
precise
,
and
it
was
the
main
precept
in
it
,
with
the
greatest
penalties
annexed
,
not
to
add
to
or
diminish
from
their
coats
one
thread
without
a
positive
command
in
the
will
.
 
<EOS>
Now
the
coats
their
father
had
left
them
were
,
it
is
true
,
of
very
good
cloth
,
and
besides
,
so
neatly
sewn
you
would
swear
they
were
all
of
a
piece
,
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
very
plain
,
with
little
or
no
ornament
;
and
it
happened
that
before
they
were
a
month
in
town
<EOS>
great
shoulder
-
knots
came
up
.
 
<EOS>
Straight
all
the
world
was
shoulder
-
knots
;
no
approaching
the
ladies
'
ruelles
without
the
quota
of
shoulder
-
knots
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
fellow
,
"
cries
one
,
"
has
no
soul
:
 
<EOS>
where
is
his
shoulder
-
knot
?
"
  
<EOS>
Our
three
brethren
soon
discovered
their
want
by
sad
experience
,
meeting
in
their
walks
with
forty
mortifications
and
indignities
.
 
<EOS>
If
they
went
to
the
playhouse
,
the
doorkeeper
showed
them
into
the
twelve
-
penny
gallery
.
 
<EOS>
If
they
called
a
boat
,
says
a
waterman
,
"
I
am
first
sculler
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
If
they
stepped
into
the
"
Rose
"
to
take
a
bottle
,
the
drawer
would
cry
,
"
Friend
,
we
sell
no
ale
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
If
they
went
to
visit
a
lady
,
a
footman
met
them
at
the
door
with
"
Pray
,
send
up
your
message
.
"
 
<EOS>
In
this
unhappy
case
they
went
immediately
to
consult
their
father
's
will
,
read
it
over
and
over
,
but
not
a
word
of
the
shoulder
-
knot
.
 
<EOS>
What
should
they
do
?
 
<EOS>
What
temper
should
they
find
?
 
<EOS>
Obedience
was
absolutely
necessary
,
and
yet
shoulder
-
knots
appeared
extremely
requisite
.
 
<EOS>
After
much
thought
,
one
of
the
brothers
,
who
happened
to
be
more
book
-
learned
than
the
other
two
,
said
he
had
found
an
expedient
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
true
,
"
said
he
,
"
there
is
nothing
here
in
this
<EOS>
will
,
totidem
verbis
,
making
mention
of
shoulder
-
knots
,
but
I
dare
conjecture
we
may
find
them
inclusive
,
or
totidem
syllabis
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
distinction
was
immediately
approved
by
all
;
and
so
they
fell
again
to
examine
the
will
.
 
<EOS>
But
their
evil
star
had
so
directed
the
matter
that
the
first
syllable
was
not
to
be
found
in
the
whole
writing
;
upon
which
disappointment
,
he
who
found
the
former
evasion
took
heart
,
and
said
,
"
Brothers
,
there
is
yet
hopes
;
for
though
we
can
not
find
them
totidem
verbis
nor
totidem
syllabis
,
I
dare
engage
we
shall
make
them
out
tertio
modo
or
totidem
literis
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
This
discovery
was
also
highly
commended
,
upon
which
they
fell
once
more
to
the
scrutiny
,
and
soon
picked
out
S
,
H
,
O
,
U
,
L
,
D
,
E
,
R
,
when
the
same
planet
,
enemy
to
their
repose
,
had
wonderfully
contrived
that
a
K
was
not
to
be
found
.
 
<EOS>
Here
was
a
weighty
difficulty
!
 
<EOS>
But
the
distinguishing
brother
(
for
whom
we
shall
hereafter
find
a
name
)
,
now
his
hand
was
in
,
proved
by
a
very
good
argument
that
K
was
a
modern
illegitimate
letter
,
unknown
to
the
learned
ages
,
nor
anywhere
to
be
found
in
ancient
manuscripts
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
true
,
"
said
he
,
"
the
word
Calendae
,
had
in
Q.
V.
C.
 
been
sometimes
writ
with
a
K
,
but
erroneously
,
for
in
the
best
copies
it
is
ever
spelt
with
a
C
;
and
by
consequence
it
was
a
gross
mistake
in
our
language
to
spell
"
knot
"
with
a
K
,
"
but
that
from
henceforward
he
would
take
care
<EOS>
it
should
be
writ
with
a
C.
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
all
further
difficulty
vanished
;
shoulder
-
knots
were
made
clearly
out
to
be
jure
paterno
,
and
our
three
gentlemen
swaggered
with
as
large
and
as
flaunting
ones
as
the
best
.
  
<EOS>
But
as
human
happiness
is
of
a
very
short
duration
,
so
in
those
days
were
human
fashions
,
upon
which
it
entirely
depends
.
 
<EOS>
Shoulder
-
knots
had
their
time
,
and
we
must
now
imagine
them
in
their
decline
,
for
a
certain
lord
came
just
from
Paris
with
fifty
yards
of
gold
lace
upon
his
coat
,
exactly
trimmed
after
the
court
fashion
of
that
month
.
 
<EOS>
In
two
days
all
mankind
appeared
closed
up
in
bars
of
gold
lace
.
<EOS>
Whoever
durst
peep
abroad
without
his
complement
of
gold
lace
was
as
scandalous
as
a
#
#
#
#
,
and
as
ill
received
among
the
women
.
 
<EOS>
What
should
our
three
knights
do
in
this
momentous
affair
?
 
<EOS>
They
had
sufficiently
strained
a
point
already
in
the
affair
of
shoulder
-
knots
.
<EOS>
Upon
recourse
to
the
will
,
nothing
appeared
there
but
altum
silentium
.
 
<EOS>
That
of
the
shoulder
-
knots
was
a
loose
,
flying
,
circumstantial
point
,
but
this
of
gold
lace
seemed
too
considerable
an
alteration
without
better
warrant
.
 
<EOS>
It
did
aliquo
modo
essentiae
adhaerere
,
and
therefore
required
a
positive
precept
.
 
<EOS>
But
about
this
time
it
fell
out
that
the
learned
brother
aforesaid
had
read
"
Aristotelis
Dialectica
,
"
and
especially
that
wonderful
piece
de
Interpretatione
,
which
has
the
faculty
of
teaching
its
readers
to
find
out
a
meaning
in
everything
but
itself
,
like
commentators
on
the
Revelations
,
who
proceed
prophets
without
understanding
a
syllable
of
the
text
.
 
<EOS>
"
Brothers
,
"
said
he
,
"
you
are
to
be
informed
that
of
wills
,
duo
sunt
genera
,
nuncupatory
and
scriptory
,
 
that
in
the
scriptory
will
here
before
us
there
is
no
precept
or
mention
about
gold
lace
,
conceditur
,
but
si
idem
affirmetur
de
nuncupatorio
negatur
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
brothers
,
if
you
remember
,
we
heard
a
fellow
say
when
we
were
boys
that
he
heard
<EOS>
my
father
's
man
say
that
he
heard
my
father
say
that
he
would
advise
his
sons
to
get
gold
lace
on
their
coats
as
soon
as
ever
they
could
procure
money
to
buy
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
very
true
,
"
cries
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
remember
it
perfectly
well
,
"
said
the
third
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
,
without
more
ado
,
they
got
the
largest
gold
lace
in
the
parish
,
and
walked
about
as
fine
as
lords
.
  
<EOS>
A
while
after
,
there
came
up
all
in
fashion
a
pretty
sort
of
flame
-
coloured
satin
 
for
linings
,
and
the
mercer
brought
a
pattern
of
it
immediately
to
our
three
gentlemen
.
 
<EOS>
"
An
please
your
worships

"
said
he
,
"
<EOS>
my
Lord
C
#

out
of
this
very
piece
last
night
;
it
takes
wonderfully
,
and
I
shall
not
have
a
remnant
left
enough
to
make
my
wife
a
pin
-
cushion
by
to
-
morrow
morning
at
ten
o'clock
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
they
fell
again
to
rummage
the
will
,
because
the
present
case
also
required
a
positive
precept
,
the
lining
being
held
by
orthodox
writers
to
be
of
the
essence
of
the
coat
.
 
<EOS>
After
long
search
they
could
fix
upon
nothing
to
the
matter
in
hand
,
except
a
short
advice
in
their
father
's
will
to
take
care
of
fire
and
put
out
their
candles
before
they
went
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
though
a
good
deal
for
the
purpose
,
and
helping
very
far
towards
self
-
conviction
,
yet
not
seeming
wholly
of
force
to
establish
a
command
,
and
being
resolved
to
avoid
farther
scruple
,
as
well
as
future
occasion
for
scandal
<EOS>
,
says
he
<EOS>
that
was
the
scholar
,
"
I
remember
to
have
read
in
wills
of
a
codicil
annexed
,
which
is
indeed
a
part
of
the
will
,
and
what
it
contains
hath
equal
authority
with
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
Now
I
have
been
considering
of
this
same
will
here
before
us
,
and
I
can
not
reckon
it
to
be
complete
for
want
of
such
a
codicil
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
therefore
fasten
one
in
its
proper
place
very
dexterously
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
had
it
by
me
some
time
;
it
was
written
by
a
dog
-
keeper
of
my
grandfather
's
,
and
talks
a
great
deal
,
as
good
luck
would
have
it
,
of
this
very
flame
-
coloured
satin
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
project
was
immediately
approved
by
the
other
two
;
an
old
parchment
scroll
was
tagged
on
according
to
art
,
in
the
form
of
a
codicil
annexed
,
and
the
satin
bought
and
worn
.
  
<EOS>
Next
winter
a
player
,
hired
for
the
purpose
by
the
Corporation
of
Fringemakers
,
acted
his
part
in
a
new
comedy
,
all
covered
with
silver
fringe
,
and
according
to
the
laudable
custom
gave
rise
to
that
fashion
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
which
the
brothers
,
consulting
their
father
's
will
,
to
their
great
astonishment
found
these
words
:
 
<EOS>
"
Item
,
I
charge
and
command
<EOS>
my
said
three
sons
to
wear
no
sort
of
silver
fringe
upon
or
about
their
said
coats
,
"
&
c.
,
with
a
penalty
in
case
of
disobedience
too
long
here
to
insert
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
after
some
pause
,
the
brother
so
often
mentioned
for
his
erudition
,
who
was
well
skilled
in
criticisms
,
had
found
in
a
certain
author
,
which
he
said
should
be
nameless
,
that
the
same
word
which
in
the
will
is
called
fringe
does
also
signify
a
broom
-
stick
,
and
doubtless
ought
to
have
the
same
interpretation
in
this
paragraph
.
 
<EOS>
This
another
of
the
brothers
disliked
,
because
of
that
epithet
silver
,
which
could
not
,
he
humbly
conceived
,
in
propriety
of
speech
be
reasonably
applied
to
a
broom
-
stick
;
but
it
was
replied
upon
him
that
this
epithet
was
understood
in
a
mythological
and
allegorical
sense
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
he
objected
again
why
their
father
should
forbid
them
to
wear
a
broom
-
stick
on
their
coats
,
a
caution
that
seemed
unnatural
and
impertinent
;
upon
which
he
was
taken
up
short
,
as
one
that
spoke
irreverently
of
a
mystery
which
doubtless
was
very
useful
and
significant
,
but
ought
not
to
be
over
-
curiously
pried
into
or
nicely
reasoned
upon
.
 
<EOS>
And
in
short
,
their
father
's
authority
being
now
considerably
sunk
,
this
expedient
was
allowed
to
serve
as
a
lawful
dispensation
for
wearing
their
full
proportion
of
silver
fringe
.
  
<EOS>
A
while
after
was
revived
an
old
fashion
,
long
antiquated
,
of
embroidery
with
Indian
figures
of
men
,
women
,
and
children
.
<EOS>
Here
they
had
no
occasion
to
examine
the
will
.
 
<EOS>
They
remembered
but
too
well
how
their
father
had
always
abhorred
this
fashion
;
that
he
made
several
paragraphs
on
purpose
,
importing
his
utter
detestation
of
it
,
and
bestowing
his
everlasting
curse
to
his
sons
whenever
they
should
wear
it
.
 
<EOS>
For
all
this
,
in
a
few
days
they
appeared
higher
in
the
fashion
than
anybody
else
in
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
solved
the
matter
by
saying
that
these
figures
were
not
at
all
the
same
with
those
that
were
formerly
worn
and
were
meant
in
the
will
;
besides
,
they
did
not
wear
them
in
that
sense
,
as
forbidden
by
their
father
,
but
as
they
were
a
commendable
custom
,
and
of
great
use
to
the
public
.
 
<EOS>
That
these
rigorous
clauses
in
the
will
did
therefore
require
some
allowance
and
a
favourable
interpretation
,
and
ought
to
be
understood
cum
grano
salis
.
  
<EOS>
But
fashions
perpetually
altering
in
that
age
,
the
scholastic
brother
grew
weary
of
searching
further
evasions
and
solving
everlasting
contradictions
.
 
<EOS>
Resolved
,
therefore
,
at
all
hazards
to
comply
with
the
modes
of
the
world
,
they
concerted
matters
together
,
and
agreed
unanimously
to
lock
up
their
father
's
will
in
a
strong
-
box
,
brought
out
of
Greece
or
Italy
 
(
I
have
forgot
which
)
,
and
trouble
themselves
no
farther
to
examine
it
,
but
only
refer
to
its
authority
whenever
they
thought
fit
.
 
<EOS>
In
consequence
whereof
,
a
while
after
it
grew
a
general
mode
to
wear
an
infinite
number
of
points
,
most
of
them
tagged
with
silver
;
upon
which
the
scholar
pronounced
ex
cathedra
 
<EOS>
that
points
were
absolutely
jure
paterno
as
they
might
very
well
remember
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
true
,
indeed
,
the
fashion
prescribed
somewhat
more
than
were
directly
named
in
the
will
;
however
,
that
they
,
as
heirs
-
general
of
their
father
,
had
power
to
make
and
add
certain
clauses
for
public
emolument
,
though
not
deducible
todidem
verbis
from
the
letter
of
the
will
,
or
else
multa
absurda
sequerentur
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
understood
for
canonical
,
and
therefore
on
the
following
Sunday
they
came
to
church
all
covered
with
points
.
  
<EOS>
The
learned
brother
so
often
mentioned
was
reckoned
the
best
scholar
in
all
that
or
the
next
street
to
it
;
insomuch
,
as
having
run
something
behindhand
with
the
world
,
he
obtained
the
favour
from
a
certain
lord
 
to
receive
him
into
his
house
and
to
teach
his
children
.
 
<EOS>
A
while
after
the
lord
died
,
and
he
,
by
long
practice
upon
his
father
's
will
,
found
the
way
of
contriving
a
deed
of
conveyance
of
that
house
to
himself
and
his
heirs
;
upon
which
he
took
possession
,
turned
the
young
squires
out
,
and
received
his
brothers
in
their
stead
.

SECTION
III
.
 
<EOS>
A
DIGRESSION
CONCERNING
CRITICS
.
  
<EOS>
Though
I
have
been
hitherto
as
cautious
as
I
could
,
upon
all
occasions
,
most
nicely
to
follow
the
rules
and
methods
of
writing
laid
down
by
the
example
of
our
illustrious
moderns
,
yet
has
the
unhappy
shortness
of
my
memory
led
me
into
an
error
,
from
which
I
must
immediately
extricate
myself
,
before
I
can
decently
pursue
my
principal
subject
.
 
<EOS>
I
confess
with
shame
<EOS>
it
was
an
unpardonable
omission
to
proceed
so
far
as
I
have
already
done
before
I
had
performed
the
due
discourses
,
expostulatory
,
supplicatory
,
or
deprecatory
,
with
my
good
lords
the
critics
.
 
<EOS>
Towards
some
atonement
for
this
grievous
neglect
,
I
do
here
make
humbly
bold
to
present
them
with
a
short
account
of
themselves
and
their
art
,
by
looking
into
the
original
and
pedigree
of
the
word
,
as
it
is
generally
understood
among
us
,
and
very
briefly
considering
the
ancient
and
present
state
thereof
.
  
<EOS>
By
the
word
critic
,
at
this
day
so
frequent
in
all
conversations
,
there
have
sometimes
been
distinguished
three
very
different
species
of
mortal
men
,
according
as
I
have
read
in
ancient
books
and
pamphlets
.
 
<EOS>
For
first
,
by
this
term
were
understood
such
persons
as
invented
or
drew
up
rules
for
themselves
and
the
world
,
by
observing
which
a
careful
reader
might
be
able
to
pronounce
upon
the
productions
of
the
learned
,
form
his
taste
to
a
true
relish
of
the
sublime
and
the
admirable
,
and
divide
every
beauty
of
matter
or
of
style
from
the
corruption
that
apes
it
.
 
<EOS>
In
their
common
perusal
of
books
,
singling
out
the
errors
and
defects
,
the
nauseous
,
the
fulsome
,
the
dull
,
and
the
impertinent
,
with
the
caution
of
a
man
that
walks
through
Edinburgh
streets
in
a
morning
,
who
is
indeed
as
careful
as
he
can
to
watch
diligently
and
spy
out
the
filth
in
his
way
;
not
that
he
is
curious
to
observe
the
colour
and
complexion
of
the
ordure
or
take
its
dimensions
,
much
less
to
be
paddling
in
or
tasting
it
,
but
only
with
a
design
to
come
out
as
cleanly
as
he
may
.
<EOS>
These
men
seem
,
though
very
erroneously
,
to
have
understood
the
appellation
of
critic
in
a
literal
sense
;
that
one
principal
part
of
his
office
was
to
praise
and
acquit
,
and
that
a
critic
who
sets
up
to
read
only
for
an
occasion
of
censure
and
reproof
is
a
creature
as
barbarous
as
a
judge
who
should
take
up
a
resolution
to
hang
all
men
that
came
before
him
upon
a
trial
.
  
<EOS>
Again
,
by
the
word
critic
have
been
meant
the
restorers
of
ancient
learning
from
the
worms
,
and
graves
,
and
dust
of
manuscripts
.
  
<EOS>
Now
the
races
of
these
two
have
been
for
some
ages
utterly
extinct
,
and
besides
to
discourse
any
further
of
them
would
not
be
at
all
to
my
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
The
third
and
noblest
sort
is
that
of
the
true
critic
,
whose
original
is
the
most
ancient
of
all
.
 
<EOS>
Every
true
critic
is
a
hero
born
,
descending
in
a
direct
line
from
a
celestial
stem
,
by
Momus
and
Hybris
,
who
begat
Zoilus
,
who
begat
Tigellius
,
who
begat
Etcaetera
the
elder
,
who
begat
Bentley
,
and
Rymer
,
and
Wotton
,
and
Perrault
,
and
Dennis
,
who
begat
Etcaetera
the
younger
.
  
<EOS>
And
these
are
the
critics
from
whom
the
commonwealth
of
learning
has
in
all
ages
received
such
immense
benefits
,
that
the
gratitude
of
their
admirers
placed
their
origin
in
heaven
,
among
those
of
Hercules
,
Theseus
,
Perseus
,
and
other
great
deservers
of
mankind
.
<EOS>
But
heroic
virtue
itself
hath
not
been
exempt
from
the
obloquy
of
evil
tongues
.
 
<EOS>
For
it
hath
been
objected
that
those
ancient
heroes
,
famous
for
their
combating
so
many
giants
,
and
dragons
,
and
robbers
,
were
in
their
own
persons
a
greater
nuisance
to
mankind
than
any
of
those
monsters
they
subdued
;
and
therefore
,
to
render
their
obligations
more
complete
,
when
all
other
vermin
were
destroyed
,
should
in
conscience
have
concluded
with
the
same
justice
upon
themselves
,
as
Hercules
most
generously
did
,
and
hath
upon
that
score
procured
for
himself
more
temples
and
votaries
than
the
best
of
his
fellows
.
 
<EOS>
For
these
reasons
I
suppose
it
is
why
some
have
conceived
it
would
be
very
expedient
for
the
public
good
of
learning
that
every
true
critic
,
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
his
task
assigned
,
should
immediately
deliver
himself
up
to
ratsbane
or
hemp
,
or
from
some
convenient
altitude
,
and
that
no
man
's
pretensions
to
so
illustrious
a
character
should
by
any
means
be
received
before
that
operation
was
performed
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
from
this
heavenly
descent
of
criticism
,
and
the
close
analogy
it
bears
to
heroic
virtue
,
it
is
easy
to
assign
the
proper
employment
of
a
true
,
ancient
,
genuine
critic
:
 
which
is
,
to
travel
through
this
vast
world
of
writings
;
to
peruse
and
hunt
those
monstrous
faults
bred
within
them
;
to
drag
out
the
lurking
errors
,
like
Cacus
from
his
den
;
to
multiply
them
like
Hydra
's
heads
;
and
rake
them
together
like
Augeas
's
dung
;
or
else
to
drive
away
a
sort
of
dangerous
fowl
who
have
a
perverse
inclination
to
plunder
the
best
branches
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
,
like
those
Stymphalian
birds
that
ate
up
the
fruit
.
  
<EOS>
These
reasonings
will
furnish
us
with
an
adequate
definition
of
a
true
critic
:
 
that
he
is
a
discoverer
and
collector
of
writers
'
faults
;
which
may
be
further
put
beyond
dispute
by
the
following
demonstration
:
  
<EOS>
That
whoever
will
examine
the
writings
in
all
kinds
wherewith
<EOS>
this
ancient
sect
hath
honoured
the
world
,
shall
immediately
find
from
the
whole
thread
and
tenor
of
them
that
the
ideas
of
the
authors
have
been
altogether
conversant
and
taken
up
with
the
faults
,
and
blemishes
,
and
oversights
,
and
mistakes
of
other
writers
,
and
let
the
subject
treated
on
be
whatever
it
will
,
their
imaginations
are
so
entirely
possessed
and
replete
with
the
defects
of
other
pens
,
that
the
very
quintessence
of
what
is
bad
does
of
necessity
distil
into
their
own
,
by
which
means
the
whole
appears
to
be
nothing
else
but
an
abstract
of
the
criticisms
themselves
have
made
.
  
<EOS>
Having
thus
briefly
considered
the
original
and
office
of
a
critic
,
as
the
word
is
understood
in
its
most
noble
and
universal
acceptation
,
I
proceed
to
refute
the
objections
of
those
who
argue
from
the
silence
and
pretermission
of
authors
,
by
which
they
pretend
to
prove
that
the
very
art
of
criticism
,
as
now
exercised
,
and
by
me
explained
,
is
wholly
modern
,
and
consequently
that
the
critics
of
Great
Britain
and
France
have
no
title
to
an
original
so
ancient
and
illustrious
as
I
have
deduced
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
if
I
can
clearly
make
out
,
on
the
contrary
,
that
the
most
ancient
writers
have
particularly
described
both
the
person
and
the
office
of
a
true
critic
agreeable
to
the
definition
laid
down
by
me
,
their
grand
objection
 
from
the
silence
of
authors
 
will
fall
to
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
I
confess
to
have
for
a
long
time
<EOS>
borne
a
part
in
this
general
error
,
from
which
I
should
never
have
acquitted
myself
but
through
the
assistance
of
our
noble
moderns
,
whose
most
edifying
volumes
I
turn
indefatigably
over
night
and
day
,
for
the
improvement
of
my
mind
and
the
good
of
my
country
.
 
<EOS>
These
have
with
unwearied
pains
made
many
useful
searches
into
the
weak
sides
of
the
ancients
,
and
given
us
a
comprehensive
list
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
they
have
proved
beyond
contradiction
that
the
very
finest
things
delivered
of
old
have
been
long
since
invented
and
brought
to
light
by
much
later
pens
,
and
that
the
noblest
discoveries
those
ancients
ever
made
in
art
or
nature
have
all
been
produced
by
the
transcending
genius
of
the
present
age
,
which
clearly
shows
how
little
merit
those
ancients
can
justly
pretend
to
,
and
takes
off
that
blind
admiration
paid
them
by
men
in
a
corner
,
who
have
the
unhappiness
of
conversing
too
little
with
present
things
.
 
<EOS>
Reflecting
maturely
upon
all
this
,
and
taking
in
the
whole
compass
of
human
nature
,
I
easily
concluded
that
these
ancients
,
highly
sensible
of
their
many
imperfections
,
must
needs
have
endeavoured
,
from
some
passages
in
their
works
,
to
obviate
,
soften
,
or
divert
the
censorious
reader
,
by
satire
or
panegyric
upon
the
true
critics
,
in
imitation
of
their
masters
,
the
moderns
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
in
the
commonplaces
 
of
both
these
I
was
plentifully
instructed
by
a
long
course
of
useful
study
in
prefaces
and
prologues
,
and
therefore
immediately
resolved
to
try
what
I
could
discover
of
either
,
by
a
diligent
perusal
of
the
most
ancient
writers
,
and
especially
those
who
treated
of
the
earliest
times
.
  
<EOS>
Here
I
found
,
to
my
great
surprise
,
that
although
they
all
entered
upon
occasion
into
particular
descriptions
of
the
true
critic
,
according
as
they
were
governed
by
their
fears
or
their
hopes
,
yet
whatever
they
touched
of
that
kind
was
with
abundance
of
caution
,
adventuring
no
further
than
mythology
and
hieroglyphic
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
I
suppose
,
gave
ground
to
superficial
readers
for
urging
the
silence
of
authors
against
the
antiquity
of
the
true
critic
,
though
the
types
are
so
apposite
,
and
the
applications
so
necessary
and
natural
,
that
it
is
not
easy
to
conceive
how
any
reader
of
modern
eye
and
taste
could
overlook
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
venture
from
a
great
number
to
produce
a
few
which
I
am
very
confident
will
put
this
question
beyond
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
It
well
deserves
considering
that
these
ancient
writers
,
in
treating
enigmatically
upon
this
subject
,
have
generally
fixed
upon
the
very
same
hieroglyph
,
varying
only
the
story
according
to
their
affections
or
their
wit
.
 
<EOS>
For
first
,
Pausanias
is
of
opinion
that
the
perfection
of
writing
correct
was
entirely
owing
to
the
institution
of
critics
,
and
that
he
can
possibly
mean
no
other
than
the
true
critic
is
,
I
think
,
manifest
enough
from
the
following
description
.
 
<EOS>
He
says
they
were
a
race
of
men
who
delighted
to
nibble
at
the
superfluities
and
excrescences
of
books
,
which
the
learned
at
length
observing
,
took
warning
of
their
own
accord
to
lop
the
luxuriant
,
the
rotten
,
the
dead
,
the
sapless
,
and
the
overgrown
branches
from
their
works
.
 
<EOS>
But
now
all
this
he
cunningly
shades
under
the
following
allegory
:
 
<EOS>
That
the
Nauplians
in
Argia
learned
the
art
of
pruning
their
vines
by
observing
that
when
an
ass
had
browsed
upon
one
of
them
,
it
thrived
the
better
and
bore
fairer
fruit
.
 
<EOS>
But
Herodotus
holding
the
very
same
hieroglyph
,
speaks
much
plainer
and
almost
in
terminis
.
 
<EOS>
He
hath
been
so
bold
as
to
tax
the
true
critics
of
ignorance
and
malice
,
telling
us
openly
,
for
I
think
nothing
can
be
plainer
,
that
in
the
western
part
of
Libya
there
were
asses
with
horns
,
upon
which
relation
<EOS>
Ctesias
 
yet
refines
,
mentioning
the
very
same
animal
about
India
;
adding
,
that
whereas
all
other
asses
wanted
a
gall
,
these
horned
ones
were
so
redundant
in
that
part
that
their
flesh
was
not
to
be
eaten
because
of
its
extreme
bitterness
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
the
reason
why
those
ancient
writers
treated
this
subject
only
by
types
and
figures
was
because
they
durst
not
make
open
attacks
against
a
party
so
potent
and
so
terrible
as
the
critics
of
those
ages
were
,
<EOS>
whose
very
voice
was
so
dreadful
that
a
legion
of
authors
would
tremble
and
drop
their
pens
at
the
sound
.
 
<EOS>
For
<EOS>
so
Herodotus
tells
us
expressly
in
another
place
how
a
vast
army
of
Scythians
was
put
to
flight
in
a
panic
terror
by
the
braying
of
an
ass
.
 
<EOS>
From
hence
it
is
conjectured
by
certain
profound
philologers
,
that
the
great
awe
and
reverence
paid
to
a
true
critic
by
the
writers
of
Britain
have
been
derived
to
us
from
those
our
Scythian
ancestors
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
this
dread
was
so
universal
,
that
in
process
of
time
those
authors
who
had
a
mind
to
publish
their
sentiments
more
freely
in
describing
the
true
critics
of
their
several
ages
,
were
forced
to
leave
off
the
use
of
the
former
hieroglyph
as
too
nearly
approaching
the
prototype
,
and
invented
other
terms
instead
thereof
that
were
more
cautious
and
mystical
.
 
<EOS>
So
Diodorus
,
speaking
to
the
same
purpose
,
ventures
no
farther
than
to
say
that
in
the
mountains
of
Helicon
there
grows
a
certain
weed
which
bears
a
flower
of
so
damned
a
scent
as
to
poison
those
who
offer
to
smell
it
.
 
<EOS>
Lucretius
gives
exactly
the
same
relation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Est
etiam
in
magnis
Heliconis
montibus
arbos
,
Floris
odore
hominem
retro
consueta
necare
.
"
 
<EOS>
Lib
.
<EOS>
6
.
   
<EOS>
But
Ctesias
,
whom
we
lately
quoted
,
has
been
a
great
deal
bolder
;
he
had
been
used
with
much
severity
by
the
true
critics
of
his
own
age
,
and
therefore
could
not
forbear
to
leave
behind
him
at
least
one
deep
mark
of
his
vengeance
against
the
whole
tribe
.
 
<EOS>
His
meaning
is
so
near
the
surface
that
I
wonder
how
it
possibly
came
to
be
overlooked
by
those
who
deny
the
antiquity
of
the
true
critics
.
 
<EOS>
For
pretending
to
make
a
description
of
many
strange
animals
about
India
,
he
has
set
down
these
remarkable
words
.
 
<EOS>
"
Among
the
rest
,
"
says
he
,
"
there
is
a
serpent
that
wants
teeth
,
and
consequently
can
not
bite
,
but
if
its
vomit
(
to
which
it
is
much
addicted
)
happens
to
fall
upon
anything
,
a
certain
rottenness
or
corruption
ensues
.
<EOS>
These
serpents
are
generally
found
among
the
mountains
where
jewels
grow
,
and
they
frequently
emit
a
poisonous
juice
,
whereof
whoever
drinks
,
that
person
's
brain
flies
out
of
his
nostrils
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
also
among
the
ancients
a
sort
of
critic
,
not
distinguished
in
specie
from
the
former
but
in
growth
or
degree
,
who
seem
to
have
been
only
the
tyros
or
junior
scholars
,
yet
because
of
their
differing
employments
they
are
frequently
mentioned
as
a
sect
by
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
The
usual
exercise
of
these
young
students
was
to
attend
constantly
at
theatres
,
and
learn
to
spy
out
the
worst
parts
of
the
play
,
whereof
they
were
obliged
carefully
to
take
note
,
and
render
a
rational
account
to
their
tutors
.
 
<EOS>
Fleshed
at
these
smaller
sports
,
like
young
wolves
,
they
grew
up
in
time
to
be
nimble
and
strong
enough
for
hunting
down
large
game
.
 
<EOS>
For
it
has
been
observed
,
both
among
ancients
and
moderns
,
that
a
true
critic
has
one
quality
in
common
with
a
whore
and
an
alderman
,
never
to
change
his
title
or
his
nature
;
that
a
grey
critic
has
been
certainly
a
green
one
,
the
perfections
and
acquirements
of
his
age
being
only
the
improved
talents
of
his
youth
,
like
hemp
,
which
some
naturalists
inform
us
is
bad
for
suffocations
,
though
taken
but
in
the
seed
.
 
<EOS>
I
esteem
the
invention
,
or
at
least
the
refinement
of
prologues
,
to
have
been
owing
to
these
younger
proficients
,
of
whom
Terence
makes
frequent
and
honourable
mention
,
under
the
name
of
Malevoli
.
  
<EOS>
Now
it
is
certain
the
institution
of
the
true
critics
was
of
absolute
necessity
to
the
commonwealth
of
learning
.
 
<EOS>
For
all
human
actions
seem
to
be
divided
like
Themistocles
and
his
company
.
 
<EOS>
One
man
can
fiddle
,
and
another
can
make
a
small
town
a
great
city
;
and
he
that
can
not
do
either
one
or
the
other
deserves
to
be
kicked
out
of
the
creation
.
 
<EOS>
The
avoiding
of
which
penalty
has
doubtless
given
the
first
birth
to
the
nation
of
critics
,
and
withal
an
occasion
for
their
secret
detractors
to
report
that
a
true
critic
is
a
sort
of
mechanic
set
up
with
a
stock
and
tools
for
his
trade
,
at
as
little
expense
as
a
tailor
;
and
that
there
is
much
analogy
between
the
utensils
and
abilities
of
both
.
 
<EOS>
That
the
"
Tailor
's
Hell
"
is
the
type
of
a
critic
's
commonplace
-
book
,
and
his
wit
and
learning
held
forth
by
the
goose
.
 
<EOS>
That
it
requires
at
least
as
many
of
these
to
the
making
up
of
one
scholar
as
of
the
others
to
the
composition
of
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
That
the
valour
of
both
is
equal
,
and
their
weapons
near
of
a
size
.
 
<EOS>
Much
may
be
said
in
answer
to
these
invidious
reflections
;
and
I
can
positively
affirm
the
first
to
be
a
falsehood
:
 
for
,
on
the
contrary
<EOS>
,
nothing
is
more
certain
than
that
it
requires
greater
layings
out
to
be
free
of
the
critic
's
company
than
of
any
other
you
can
name
.
 
<EOS>
For
as
to
be
a
true
beggar
,
it
will
cost
the
richest
candidate
every
groat
he
is
worth
,
so
before
one
can
commence
a
true
critic
,
it
will
cost
a
man
all
the
good
qualities
of
his
mind
,
which
perhaps
for
a
less
purchase
would
be
thought
but
an
indifferent
bargain
.
  
<EOS>
Having
thus
amply
proved
the
antiquity
of
criticism
and
described
the
primitive
state
of
it
,
I
shall
now
examine
the
present
condition
of
this
Empire
,
and
show
how
well
it
agrees
with
its
ancient
self
.
 
<EOS>
A
certain
author
,
whose
works
have
many
ages
since
been
entirely
lost
,
does
in
his
fifth
book
and
eighth
chapter
say
of
critics
that
"
their
writings
are
the
mirrors
of
learning
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
<EOS>
I
understand
in
a
literal
sense
,
and
suppose
our
author
must
mean
that
whoever
designs
to
be
a
perfect
writer
must
inspect
into
the
books
of
critics
,
and
correct
his
inventions
there
as
in
a
mirror
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
whoever
considers
that
the
mirrors
of
the
ancients
were
made
of
brass
and
fine
mercurio
,
may
presently
apply
the
two
principal
qualifications
of
a
true
modern
critic
,
and
consequently
must
needs
conclude
that
these
have
always
been
and
must
be
for
ever
the
same
.
<EOS>
For
brass
is
an
emblem
of
duration
,
and
when
it
is
skilfully
burnished
will
cast
reflections
from
its
own
superficies
without
any
assistance
of
mercury
from
behind
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
other
talents
of
a
critic
will
not
require
a
particular
mention
,
being
included
or
easily
deducible
to
these
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
I
shall
conclude
with
three
maxims
,
which
may
serve
both
as
characteristics
to
distinguish
a
true
modern
critic
from
a
pretender
,
and
will
be
also
of
admirable
use
to
those
worthy
spirits
who
engage
in
so
useful
and
honourable
an
art
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
is
,
that
criticism
,
contrary
to
all
other
faculties
of
the
intellect
,
is
ever
held
the
truest
and
best
when
it
is
the
very
first
result
of
the
critic
's
mind
;
as
fowlers
reckon
the
first
aim
for
the
surest
,
and
seldom
fail
of
missing
the
mark
if
they
stay
not
for
a
second
.
  
<EOS>
Secondly
,
the
true
critics
are
known
by
their
talent
of
swarming
about
the
noblest
writers
,
to
which
they
are
carried
merely
by
instinct
,
as
a
rat
to
the
best
cheese
,
or
a
wasp
to
the
fairest
fruit
.
 
<EOS>
So
when
the
king
is
a
horseback
he
is
sure
to
be
the
dirtiest
person
of
the
company
,
and
they
that
make
their
court
best
are
such
as
bespatter
him
most
.
  
<EOS>
Lastly
,
a
true
critic
in
the
perusal
of
a
book
is
like
a
dog
at
a
feast
,
whose
thoughts
and
stomach
are
wholly
set
upon
what
the
guests
fling
away
,
and
consequently
is
apt
to
snarl
most
when
there
are
the
fewest
bones
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
much
I
think
is
sufficient
to
serve
by
way
of
address
to
my
patrons
,
the
true
modern
critics
,
and
may
very
well
atone
for
my
past
silence
,
as
well
as
that
which
I
am
like
to
observe
for
the
future
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
have
deserved
so
well
of
their
whole
body
as
to
meet
with
generous
and
tender
usage
at
their
hands
.
 
<EOS>
Supported
by
which
expectation
<EOS>
I
go
on
boldly
to
pursue
those
adventures
already
so
happily
begun
.
  
<EOS>
SECTION
IV
.
 
<EOS>
A
TALE
OF
A
TUB
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
now
with
much
pains
and
study
conducted
the
reader
to
a
period
where
he
must
expect
to
hear
of
great
revolutions
.
 
<EOS>
For
no
sooner
had
our
learned
brother
,
so
often
mentioned
,
got
a
warm
house
of
his
own
over
his
head
,
than
he
began
to
look
big
and
to
take
mightily
upon
him
,
<EOS>
insomuch
that
unless
the
gentle
reader
out
of
his
great
candour
will
please
a
little
to
exalt
his
idea
,
I
am
afraid
he
will
henceforth
hardly
know
the
hero
of
the
play
when
he
happens
to
meet
him
,
his
part
,
his
dress
,
and
his
mien
being
so
much
altered
.
  
<EOS>
He
told
his
brothers
he
would
have
them
to
know
that
he
was
their
elder
,
and
consequently
his
father
's
sole
heir
;
nay
,
a
while
after
,
he
would
not
allow
them
to
call
him
brother
,
but
Mr.
Peter
;
and
then
he
must
be
styled
Father
Peter
,
and
sometimes
My
Lord
Peter
.
 
<EOS>
To
support
this
grandeur
,
which
he
soon
began
to
consider
could
not
be
maintained
without
a
better
fonde
than
what
he
was
born
to
,
after
much
thought
he
cast
about
at
last
to
turn
projector
and
virtuoso
,
wherein
he
so
well
succeeded
,
that
many
famous
discoveries
,
projects
,
and
machines
which
bear
great
vogue
and
practice
at
present
in
the
world
,
are
owing
entirely
to
Lord
Peter
's
invention
.
<EOS>
I
will
deduce
the
best
account
I
have
been
able
to
collect
of
the
chief
amongst
them
,
without
considering
much
the
order
they
came
out
in
,
because
I
think
authors
are
not
well
agreed
as
to
that
point
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
when
this
treatise
of
mine
shall
be
translated
into
foreign
languages
(
as
I
may
without
vanity
affirm
that
the
labour
of
collecting
,
the
faithfulness
in
recounting
,
and
the
great
usefulness
of
the
matter
to
the
public
,
will
amply
deserve
that
justice
)
,
that
of
the
several
Academies
abroad
,
especially
those
of
France
and
Italy
,
will
favourably
accept
these
humble
offers
for
the
advancement
of
universal
knowledge
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
also
advertise
the
most
reverend
fathers
<EOS>
the
Eastern
missionaries
that
I
have
purely
for
their
sakes
made
use
of
such
words
and
phrases
as
will
best
admit
an
easy
turn
into
any
of
the
Oriental
languages
,
especially
the
Chinese
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
I
proceed
with
great
content
of
mind
upon
reflecting
how
much
emolument
this
whole
globe
of
earth
is
like
to
reap
by
my
labours
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
undertaking
of
Lord
Peter
was
to
purchase
a
large
continent
,
lately
said
to
have
been
discovered
in
Terra
Australis
incognita
.
 
<EOS>
This
tract
of
land
he
bought
at
a
very
great
pennyworth
from
the
discoverers
themselves
(
though
some
pretended
to
doubt
whether
they
had
ever
been
there
)
,
and
then
retailed
it
into
several
cantons
to
certain
dealers
,
who
carried
over
colonies
,
but
were
all
shipwrecked
in
the
voyage
;
upon
which
Lord
Peter
sold
the
said
continent
to
other
customers
again
and
again
,
and
again
and
again
,
with
the
same
success
.
  
<EOS>
The
second
project
I
shall
mention
was
his
sovereign
remedy
for
the
worms
,
especially
those
in
the
spleen
.
 
<EOS>
The
patient
was
to
eat
nothing
after
supper
for
three
nights
;
as
soon
as
he
went
to
bed
,
he
was
carefully
to
lie
on
one
side
,
and
when
he
grew
weary
,
to
turn
upon
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
also
duly
confine
his
two
eyes
to
the
same
object
,
and
by
no
means
break
wind
at
both
ends
together
without
manifest
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
These
prescriptions
diligently
observed
,
the
worms
would
void
insensibly
by
perspiration
ascending
through
the
brain
.
  
<EOS>
A
third
invention
was
the
erecting
of
a
whispering
-
office
for
the
public
good
and
ease
of
all
such
as
are
hypochondriacal
or
troubled
with
the
cholic
,
as
likewise
of
all
eavesdroppers
,
physicians
,
midwives
,
small
politicians
,
friends
fallen
out
,
repeating
poets
,
<EOS>
lovers
happy
or
in
despair
,
bawds
,
privy
-
counsellors
,
pages
,
parasites
and
buffoons
,
in
short
,
of
all
such
as
are
in
danger
of
bursting
with
too
much
wind
.
 
<EOS>
An
ass
's
head
was
placed
so
conveniently
,
that
the
party
affected
might
easily
with
his
mouth
accost
either
of
the
animal
's
ears
,
which
he
was
to
apply
close
for
a
certain
space
,
and
by
a
fugitive
faculty
peculiar
to
the
ears
of
that
animal
,
receive
immediate
benefit
,
either
by
eructation
,
or
expiration
,
or
evomition
.
  
<EOS>
Another
very
beneficial
project
of
Lord
Peter
's
was
an
office
of
insurance
for
tobacco
-
pipes
,
martyrs
of
the
modern
zeal
,
volumes
of
poetry
,
shadows
.
.
.
.
<EOS>
and
rivers
,
that
these
,
nor
any
of
these
,
shall
receive
damage
by
fire
.
 
<EOS>
From
whence
our
friendly
societies
may
plainly
find
themselves
to
be
only
transcribers
from
this
original
,
though
the
one
and
the
other
have
been
of
great
benefit
to
the
undertakers
as
well
as
of
equal
to
the
public
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Peter
was
also
held
the
original
author
of
puppets
and
raree
-
shows
,
<EOS>
the
great
usefulness
whereof
being
so
generally
known
<EOS>
,
I
shall
not
enlarge
farther
upon
this
particular
.
  
<EOS>
But
another
discovery
for
which
he
was
much
renowned
was
his
famous
universal
pickle
.
 
<EOS>
For
having
remarked
how
your
common
pickle
in
use
among
housewives
was
of
no
farther
benefit
than
to
preserve
dead
flesh
and
certain
kinds
of
vegetables
,
Peter
with
great
cost
as
well
as
art
had
contrived
a
pickle
proper
for
houses
,
gardens
,
towns
,
men
,
women
,
children
,
and
cattle
,
wherein
he
could
preserve
them
as
sound
as
insects
in
amber
.
 
<EOS>
Now
this
pickle
to
the
taste
,
the
smell
,
and
the
sight
,
appeared
exactly
the
same
with
what
is
in
common
service
for
beef
,
and
butter
,
and
herrings
(
and
has
been
often
that
way
applied
with
great
success
)
,
but
for
its
may
sovereign
virtues
was
quite
a
different
thing
.
 
<EOS>
For
Peter
would
put
in
a
certain
quantity
of
his
powder
pimperlim
-
pimp
,
after
which
it
never
failed
of
success
.
 
<EOS>
The
operation
was
performed
by
spargefaction
in
a
proper
time
of
the
moon
.
 
<EOS>
The
patient
who
was
to
be
pickled
,
if
it
were
a
house
,
would
infallibly
be
preserved
from
all
spiders
,
rats
,
and
weasels
;
if
the
party
affected
were
a
dog
,
he
should
be
exempt
from
mange
,
and
madness
,
and
hunger
.
 
<EOS>
It
also
infallibly
took
away
all
scabs
and
lice
,
and
scalled
heads
from
children
,
never
hindering
the
patient
from
any
duty
,
either
at
bed
or
board
.
  
<EOS>
But
of
all
Peter
's
rarities
,
he
most
valued
a
certain
set
of
bulls
,
whose
race
was
by
great
fortune
preserved
in
a
lineal
descent
from
those
that
guarded
the
golden
-
fleece
.
 
<EOS>
Though
some
who
pretended
to
observe
them
curiously
doubted
the
breed
had
not
been
kept
entirely
chaste
,
because
they
had
degenerated
from
their
ancestors
in
some
qualities
,
and
had
acquired
others
very
extraordinary
,
but
a
foreign
mixture
.
 
<EOS>
The
bulls
of
Colchis
are
recorded
to
have
brazen
feet
;
but
whether
it
happened
by
ill
pasture
and
running
,
by
an
alloy
from
intervention
of
other
parents
from
stolen
intrigues
;
whether
a
weakness
in
their
progenitors
had
impaired
the
seminal
virtue
,
or
by
a
decline
necessary
through
a
long
course
of
time
,
the
originals
of
nature
being
depraved
in
these
latter
sinful
ages
of
the
world
  
<EOS>
whatever
was
the
cause
,
it
is
certain
that
Lord
Peter
's
bulls
were
extremely
vitiated
by
the
rust
of
time
in
the
metal
of
their
feet
,
which
was
now
sunk
into
common
lead
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
the
terrible
roaring
peculiar
to
their
lineage
was
preserved
,
as
likewise
that
faculty
of
breathing
out
fire
from
their
nostrils
;
which
notwithstanding
many
of
their
detractors
took
to
be
a
feat
of
art
,
and
to
be
nothing
so
terrible
as
it
appeared
,
proceeding
only
from
their
usual
course
of
diet
,
which
was
of
squibs
and
crackers
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
they
had
two
peculiar
marks
which
extremely
distinguished
them
from
the
bulls
of
Jason
,
and
which
I
have
not
met
together
in
the
description
of
any
other
monster
beside
that
in
.
 
<EOS>
Horace
,
"
Varias
inducere
plumas
,
"
and
"
Atrum
definit
in
piscem
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
For
these
had
fishes
tails
,
yet
upon
occasion
could
outfly
any
bird
in
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
Peter
put
these
bulls
upon
several
employs
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
he
would
set
them
a
roaring
to
fright
naughty
boys
and
make
them
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
he
would
send
them
out
upon
errands
of
great
importance
,
where
it
is
wonderful
to
recount
,
and
perhaps
the
cautious
reader
may
think
much
to
believe
it
;
an
appetitus
sensibilis
deriving
itself
through
the
whole
family
from
their
noble
ancestors
,
guardians
of
the
Golden
Fleece
,
they
continued
so
extremely
fond
of
gold
,
that
if
Peter
sent
them
abroad
,
though
it
were
only
upon
a
compliment
,
they
would
roar
,
and
spit
,
and
belch
,
and
snivel
out
fire
,
and
keep
a
perpetual
coil
till
you
flung
them
a
bit
of
gold
;
but
then
pulveris
exigui
jactu
,
they
would
grow
calm
and
quiet
as
lambs
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
whether
by
secret
connivance
or
encouragement
from
their
master
,
or
out
of
their
own
liquorish
affection
to
gold
,
or
both
,
it
is
certain
they
were
no
better
than
a
sort
of
sturdy
,
swaggering
beggars
;
and
where
they
could
not
prevail
to
get
an
alms
,
would
make
women
miscarry
and
children
fall
into
fits
;
who
to
this
very
day
usually
call
sprites
and
hobgoblins
by
the
name
of
bull
-
beggars
.
 
<EOS>
They
grew
at
last
so
very
troublesome
to
the
neighbourhood
,
that
some
gentlemen
of
the
North
-
West
got
a
parcel
of
right
English
bull
-
dogs
,
and
baited
them
so
terribly
,
that
they
felt
it
ever
after
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
needs
mention
one
more
of
Lord
Peter
's
projects
,
which
was
very
extraordinary
,
and
discovered
him
to
be
master
of
a
high
reach
and
profound
invention
.
 
<EOS>
Whenever
it
happened
that
any
rogue
of
Newgate
was
condemned
to
be
hanged
,
Peter
would
offer
him
a
pardon
for
a
certain
sum
of
money
,
which
when
the
poor
caitiff
had
made
all
shifts
to
scrape
up
and
send
,
his
lordship
would
return
a
piece
of
paper
in
this
form
:
    
"

The

trusting
to
this

their
lives
and
money
too
.
  
<EOS>
I
desire
of
those
whom
the
learned
among
posterity
will
appoint
for
commentators
upon
this
elaborate
treatise
,
that
they
will
proceed
with
great
caution
upon
certain
dark
points
,
wherein
all
who
are
not
vere
adepti
may
be
in
danger
to
form
rash
and
hasty
conclusions
,
especially
in
some
mysterious
paragraphs
,
where
certain
arcana
are
joined
for
brevity
sake
,
which
in
the
operation
must
be
divided
.
<EOS>
And
I
am
certain
that
future
sons
of
art
will
return
large
thanks
to
my
memory
for
so
grateful
,
so
useful
an
inmuendo
.
  
<EOS>
It
will
be
no
difficult
part
to
persuade
the
reader
that
so
many
worthy
discoveries
met
with
great
success
in
the
world
;
though
I
may
justly
assure
him
that
I
have
related
much
the
smallest
number
;
my
design
having
been
only
to
single
out
such
as
will
be
of
most
benefit
for
public
imitation
,
or
which
best
served
to
give
some
idea
of
the
reach
and
wit
of
the
inventor
.
 
<EOS>
And
therefore
it
need
not
be
wondered
if
by
this
time
Lord
Peter
was
become
exceeding
rich
.
 
<EOS>
But
alas
!
<EOS>
he
had
kept
his
brain
so
long
and
so
violently
upon
the
rack
,
that
at
last
it
shook
itself
,
and
began
to
turn
round
for
a
little
ease
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
what
with
pride
,
projects
,
and
knavery
,
<EOS>
poor
Peter
was
grown
distracted
,
and
conceived
the
strangest
imaginations
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
height
of
his
fits
(
as
it
is
usual
with
those
who
run
mad
out
of
pride
)
he
would
call
himself
God
Almighty
,
and
sometimes
monarch
of
the
universe
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
seen
him
(
says
my
author
)
take
three
old
high
-
crowned
hats
,
and
clap
them
all
on
his
head
,
three
storey
high
,
with
a
huge
bunch
of
keys
at
his
girdle
,
and
an
angling
rod
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
In
which
guise
,
whoever
went
to
take
him
by
the
hand
in
the
way
of
salutation
,
Peter
with
much
grace
,
like
a
well
-
educated
spaniel
,
would
present
them
with
his
foot
,
and
if
they
refused
his
civility
,
then
he
would
raise
it
as
high
as
their
chops
,
and
give
them
a
damned
kick
on
the
mouth
,
which
hath
ever
since
been
called
a
salute
.
 
<EOS>
Whoever
walked
by
without
paying
him
their
compliments
,
having
a
wonderful
strong
breath
,
he
would
blow
their
hats
off
into
the
dirt
.
 
<EOS>
Meantime
his
affairs
at
home
went
upside
down
,
and
his
two
brothers
had
a
wretched
time
,
where
his
first
boutade
was
to
kick
both
their
wives
one
morning
out
of
doors
,
and
his
own
too
,
and
in
their
stead
gave
orders
to
pick
up
the
first
three
strollers
could
be
met
with
in
the
streets
.
 
<EOS>
A
while
after
he
nailed
up
the
cellar
door
,
and
would
not
allow
his
brothers
a
drop
of
drink
to
their
victuals
.
 
<EOS>
Dining
one
day
at
an
alderman
's
in
the
city
<EOS>
,
Peter
observed
him
expatiating
,
after
the
manner
of
his
brethren
in
the
praises
of
his
sirloin
of
beef
.
 
<EOS>
"
Beef
,
"
said
the
sage
magistrate
,
"
is
the
king
of
meat
;
beef
comprehends
in
it
the
quintessence
of
partridge
,
and
quail
,
and
venison
,
and
pheasant
,
and
plum
-
pudding
,
and
custard
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
When
Peter
came
home
,
he
would
needs
take
the
fancy
of
cooking
up
this
doctrine
into
use
,
and
apply
the
precept
in
default
of
a
sirloin
to
his
brown
loaf
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bread
,
"
says
he
,
"
dear
brothers
,
is
the
staff
of
life
,
in
which
bread
is
contained
inclusive
the
quintessence
of
beef
,
mutton
,
veal
,
venison
,
partridge
,
plum
-
pudding
,
and
custard
,
and
to
render
all
complete
,
there
is
intermingled
a
due
quantity
of
water
,
whose
crudities
are
also
corrected
by
yeast
or
barm
,
through
which
means
it
becomes
a
wholesome
fermented
liquor
,
diffused
through
the
mass
of
the
bread
.
<EOS>
"
Upon
the
strength
of
these
conclusions
,
next
day
at
dinner
was
the
brown
loaf
served
up
in
all
the
formality
of
a
City
feast
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
,
brothers
,
"
said
Peter
,
"
fall
to
,
and
spare
not
;
here
is
excellent
good
mutton
;
or
hold
,
now
my
hand
is
in
,
I
'll
help
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
which
word
,
in
much
ceremony
,
with
fork
and
knife
,
he
carves
out
two
good
slices
of
a
loaf
,
and
presents
each
on
a
plate
to
his
brothers
.
<EOS>
The
elder
of
the
two
,
not
suddenly
entering
into
Lord
Peter
's
conceit
,
began
with
very
civil
language
to
examine
the
mystery
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
doubt
,
with
great
submission
,
there
may
be
some
mistake
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
"
says
Peter
,
"
you
are
pleasant
;
come
then
,
let
us
hear
this
jest
your
head
is
so
big
with

"
None
in

Lord
;
but
unless
I
am
very
much
deceived
,
your
Lordship
was
pleased
a
while
ago
to
let
fall
a
word
about
mutton
,
and
I
would
be
glad
to
see
it
with
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
How
,
"
said
Peter
,
appearing
in
great
surprise
,
"
I
do
not
comprehend
this
at
all
;
"
upon
which
the
younger
,
interposing
to
set
the
business
right
<EOS>
,
"
My
Lord
,
"
said
he
,
"
my
brother
,
I
suppose
,
is
hungry
,
and
longs
for
the
mutton
your
Lordship
hath
promised
us
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
"
said
Peter
,
"
take
me
along
with
you
,
either
you
are
both
mad
,
or
disposed
to
be
merrier
than
I
approve
of
;
if
you
there
do
not
like
your
piece
,
I
will
carve
you
another
,
though
I
should
take
that
to
be
the
choice
bit
of
the
whole
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
then
,
my
Lord
?
"
replied
the
first
;
"
it
seems
this
is
a
shoulder
of
mutton
all
this
while
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
sir
,
"
says
Peter
,
"
eat
your
victuals
and
leave
off
your
impertinence
,
if
you
please
,
for
I
am
not
disposed
to
relish
it
at
present
;
"
but
the
other
could
not
forbear
,
being
over
-
provoked
at
the
affected
seriousness
of
Peter
's
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
Lord
,
"
said
he
,
<EOS>
"
I
can
only
say
,
that
to
my
eyes
and
fingers
,
and
teeth
and
nose
,
it
seems
to
be
nothing
but
a
crust
of
bread
.
"
 
<EOS>
Upon
which
the
second
put
in
his
word
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
saw
a
piece
of
mutton
in
my
life
so
nearly
resembling
a
slice
from
a
twelve
-
penny
loaf
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Look
ye
,
gentlemen
,
"
cries
Peter
in
a
rage
,
"
to
convince
you
what
a
couple
of
blind
,
positive
,
ignorant
,
wilful
puppies
you
are
,
I
will
use
but
<EOS>
this
plain
argument
;
by
G
#
#
#
#
,
it
is
true
,
good
,
natural
mutton
as
any
in
Leadenhall
Market
;
and
G
#
#
#
#
confound
<EOS>
you
both
eternally
if
you
offer
to
believe
otherwise
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Such
a
thundering
proof
as
this
left
no
further
room
for
objection
<EOS>
;
the
two
unbelievers
began
to
gather
and
pocket
up
their
mistake
as
hastily
as
they
could
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
truly
,
"
said
the
first
,
"
upon
more
mature
consideration
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
"
says
the
other
,
interrupting
him
,
"
now
I
have
thought
better
on
the
thing
,
your
Lordship
seems
to
have
a
great
deal
of
reason
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Very
well
,
"
said
Peter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
,
boy
,
fill
me
a
beer
-
glass
of
claret
.
 
<EOS>
Here
's
to
you
both
with
all
my
heart
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
two
brethren
,
much
delighted
to
see
him
so
readily
appeased
,
returned
their
most
humble
thanks
,
and
said
they
would
be
glad
to
pledge
his
Lordship
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
you
shall
,
"
said
Peter
,
"
I
am
not
a
person
to
refuse
you
anything
that
is
reasonable
;
wine
moderately
taken
is
a
cordial
.
 
<EOS>
Here
is
a
glass
apiece
for
you
;
it
is
true
natural
juice
from
the
grape
;
none
of
your
damned
vintner
's
brewings
.
"
 
<EOS>
Having
spoke
thus
,
he
presented
to
each
of
them
another
large
dry
crust
,
bidding
them
drink
it
off
,
and
not
be
bashful
,
for
it
would
do
them
<EOS>
no
hurt
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
brothers
,
after
having
performed
the
usual
office
in
such
delicate
conjunctures
,
of
staring
a
sufficient
period
at
Lord
Peter
and
each
other
,
and
finding
how
matters
were
like
to
go
,
resolved
not
to
enter
on
a
new
dispute
,
but
let
him
carry
the
point
as
he
pleased
;
for
he
was
now
got
into
one
of
his
mad
fits
,
and
to
argue
or
expostulate
further
would
only
serve
to
render
him
a
hundred
times
more
untractable
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
chosen
to
relate
this
worthy
matter
in
all
its
circumstances
,
because
it
gave
a
principal
occasion
to
that
great
and
famous
rupture
 
which
happened
about
the
same
time
among
these
brethren
,
and
was
never
afterwards
made
up
.
 
<EOS>
But
of
that
I
shall
treat
at
large
in
another
section
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
it
is
certain
that
Lord
Peter
,
even
in
his
lucid
intervals
,
was
very
lewdly
given
in
his
common
conversation
,
extreme
wilful
and
positive
,
and
would
at
any
time
rather
argue
to
the
death
than
allow
himself
to
be
once
in
an
error
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
he
had
an
abominable
faculty
of
telling
huge
palpable
lies
upon
all
occasions
,
and
swearing
not
only
to
the
truth
,
but
cursing
the
whole
company
to
hell
if
they
pretended
to
make
the
least
scruple
of
believing
him
.
<EOS>
One
time
he
swore
he
had
a
cow
at
home
which
gave
as
much
milk
at
a
meal
as
would
fill
three
thousand
churches
,
and
what
was
yet
more
extraordinary
,
would
never
turn
sour
.
 
<EOS>
Another
time
he
was
telling
of
an
old
sign
-
post
 
that
belonged
to
his
father
,
with
nails
and
timber
enough
on
it
to
build
sixteen
large
men
-
of
-
war
.
 
<EOS>
Talking
one
day
of
Chinese
waggons
,
which
were
made
so
light
as
to
sail
over
mountains
,
"
Z####nds
,
"
said
Peter
,
"
<EOS>
where
's
the
wonder
of
that
?
 
<EOS>
By
G
#
#
#
#
,
I
saw
a
large
house
of
lime
and
stone
travel
over
sea
and
land
(
granting
that
it
stopped
sometimes
to
bait
)
above
two
thousand
German
leagues
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
that
which
was
the
good
of
it
,
he
would
swear
desperately
all
the
while
that
he
never
told
a
lie
in
his
life
,
and
at
every
word
:
 
"
<EOS>
By
G
#
#
#
#
gentlemen
,
I
tell
you
nothing
but
the
truth
,
and
the
d####l
broil
them
eternally
that
will
not
believe
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
short
,
Peter
grew
so
scandalous
that
all
the
neighbourhood
began
in
plain
words
to
say
he
was
no
better
than
a
knave
;
and
his
two
brothers
,
long
weary
of
his
ill
-
usage
,
resolved
at
last
to
leave
him
;
but
first
they
humbly
desired
a
copy
of
their
father
's
will
,
which
had
now
lain
by
neglected
time
out
of
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Instead
of
granting
this
request
,
he
called
them
rogues
,
traitors
,
and
the
rest
of
the
vile
names
he
could
muster
up
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
while
he
was
abroad
one
day
upon
his
projects
,
the
two
youngsters
watched
their
opportunity
,
made
a
shift
to
come
at
the
will
,
and
took
a
copia
vera
,
by
which
they
presently
saw
how
grossly
they
had
been
abused
,
their
father
having
left
them
equal
heirs
,
and
strictly
commanded
that
whatever
they
got
should
lie
in
common
among
them
all
.
<EOS>
Pursuant
to
which
,
their
next
enterprise
was
to
break
open
the
cellar
-
door
and
get
a
little
good
drink
to
spirit
and
comfort
their
hearts
.
 
<EOS>
In
copying
the
will
,
they
had
met
another
precept
against
whoring
,
divorce
,
and
separate
maintenance
;
upon
which
,
their
next
work
was
to
discard
their
concubines
and
send
for
their
wives
.
 
<EOS>
Whilst
all
this
was
in
agitation
,
there
enters
a
solicitor
from
Newgate
,
desiring
Lord
Peter
would
please
to
procure
a
pardon
for
a
thief
that
was
to
be
hanged
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
two
brothers
told
him
he
was
a
coxcomb
to
seek
pardons
from
a
fellow
who
deserved
to
be
hanged
much
better
than
his
client
,
and
discovered
all
the
method
of
that
imposture
in
the
same
form
I
delivered
it
a
while
ago
,
advising
the
solicitor
to
put
his
friend
upon
obtaining
a
pardon
from
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
all
this
platter
and
revolution
in
comes
Peter
with
a
file
of
dragoons
at
his
heels
,
and
gathering
from
all
hands
<EOS>
what
was
in
the
wind
,
he
and
his
gang
,
after
several
millions
of
scurrilities
and
curses
not
very
important
here
to
repeat
,
by
main
force
very
fairly
kicks
them
both
out
of
doors
,
and
would
never
let
them
come
under
his
roof
from
that
day
to
this
.

SECTION
<EOS>
V.
 
A
DIGRESSION
IN
THE
MODERN
KIND
.
  
<EOS>
We
whom
the
world
is
pleased
to
honour
with
the
title
of
modern
authors
,
should
never
have
been
able
to
compass
our
great
design
of
an
everlasting
remembrance
and
never
-
dying
fame
if
our
endeavours
had
not
been
so
highly
serviceable
to
the
general
good
of
mankind
.
<EOS>
This
,
O
universe
!
<EOS>
is
the
adventurous
attempt
of
me
,
thy
secretary
        
"
Quemvis
perferre
laborem
Suadet
,
et
inducit
noctes
vigilare
serenas
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
To
this
end
I
have
some
time
since
,
with
a
world
of
pains
and
art
,
dissected
the
carcass
of
human
nature
,
and
read
many
useful
lectures
upon
the
several
parts
,
both
containing
and
contained
,
till
at
last
it
smelt
so
strong
<EOS>
I
could
preserve
it
no
longer
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
which
I
have
been
at
a
great
expense
to
fit
up
all
the
bones
with
exact
contexture
and
in
due
symmetry
,
so
that
I
am
ready
to
show
a
very
complete
anatomy
thereof
to
all
curious
gentlemen
and
others
.
 
<EOS>
But
not
to
digress
further
in
the
midst
of
a
digression
,
as
I
have
known
some
authors
<EOS>
enclose
digressions
in
one
another
like
a
nest
of
boxes
,
I
do
affirm
that
,
having
carefully
cut
up
human
nature
<EOS>
,
I
have
found
a
very
strange
,
new
,
and
important
discovery
:
 
that
the
public
good
of
mankind
is
performed
by
two
ways
 
instruction
and
diversion
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
have
further
proved
my
said
several
readings
(
which
,
perhaps
,
the
world
may
one
day
see
,
if
I
can
prevail
on
any
friend
to
steal
a
copy
,
or
on
certain
gentlemen
of
my
admirers
to
be
very
importunate
)
<EOS>
that
,
as
mankind
is
now
disposed
,
he
receives
much
greater
advantage
by
being
diverted
than
instructed
,
his
epidemical
diseases
being
fastidiosity
,
amorphy
,
and
oscitation
;
whereas
,
in
the
present
universal
empire
of
wit
and
learning
,
there
seems
but
little
matter
left
for
instruction
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
in
compliance
with
a
lesson
of
great
age
and
authority
,
I
have
attempted
carrying
the
point
in
all
its
heights
,
and
accordingly
throughout
this
divine
treatise
have
skilfully
kneaded
up
both
together
with
a
layer
of
utile
and
a
layer
of
dulce
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
consider
how
exceedingly
our
illustrious
moderns
have
eclipsed
the
weak
glimmering
lights
of
the
ancients
,
and
turned
them
out
of
the
road
of
all
fashionable
commerce
to
a
degree
that
our
choice
town
wits
of
most
refined
accomplishments
are
in
grave
dispute
whether
there
have
been
ever
any
ancients
or
no
;
in
which
point
we
are
like
to
receive
wonderful
satisfaction
from
the
most
useful
labours
and
lucubrations
of
that
worthy
modern
,
Dr.
Bentley
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
when
I
consider
all
this
,
I
can
not
but
bewail
that
no
famous
modern
hath
ever
yet
attempted
an
universal
system
in
a
small
portable
volume
of
all
things
that
are
to
be
known
,
or
believed
,
or
imagined
,
or
practised
in
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
,
however
,
forced
to
acknowledge
that
such
an
enterprise
was
thought
on
some
time
ago
by
a
great
philosopher
of
O
-
Brazile
.
 
<EOS>
The
method
he
proposed
was
by
a
certain
curious
receipt
,
a
nostrum
,
which
after
his
untimely
death
I
found
among
his
papers
,
and
do
here
,
out
of
my
great
affection
to
the
modern
learned
,
present
them
with
it
,
not
doubting
it
may
one
day
encourage
some
worthy
undertaker
.
  
<EOS>
You
take
fair
correct
copies
,
well
bound
in
calf
's
skin
and
lettered
at
the
back
,
of
all
modern
bodies
of
arts
and
sciences
whatsoever
,
and
in
what
language
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
These
you
distil
in
balneo
Mariae
,
infusing
quintessence
of
poppy
Q.S.
,
together
with
three
pints
of
lethe
,
to
be
had
from
the
apothecaries
.
 
<EOS>
You
cleanse
away
carefully
the
sordes
and
caput
mortuum
,
letting
all
that
is
volatile
evaporate
.
 
<EOS>
You
preserve
only
the
first
running
,
which
is
again
to
be
distilled
seventeen
times
,
<EOS>
till
what
remains
will
amount
to
about
two
drams
.
 
<EOS>
This
you
keep
in
a
glass
vial
hermetically
sealed
for
one
-
and
-
twenty
days
.
 
<EOS>
Then
you
begin
your
catholic
treatise
,
taking
every
morning
fasting
(
first
shaking
the
vial
)
<EOS>
three
drops
of
this
elixir
,
snuffing
it
strongly
up
your
nose
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
dilate
itself
about
the
brain
(
where
there
is
any
)
in
fourteen
minutes
,
and
you
immediately
perceive
in
your
head
an
infinite
number
of
abstracts
,
summaries
,
compendiums
,
extracts
,
collections
,
medullas
,
excerpta
quaedams
,
florilegias
and
the
like
,
all
disposed
into
great
order
and
reducible
upon
paper
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
needs
own
<EOS>
it
was
by
the
assistance
of
this
arcanum
that
I
,
though
otherwise
impar
,
have
adventured
upon
so
daring
an
attempt
,
never
achieved
or
undertaken
before
but
by
a
certain
author
called
Homer
,
<EOS>
in
whom
,
though
otherwise
a
person
not
without
some
abilities
,
and
for
an
ancient
of
a
tolerable
genius
;
I
have
discovered
many
gross
errors
which
are
not
to
be
forgiven
his
very
ashes
,
if
by
chance
any
of
them
are
left
.
 
<EOS>
For
whereas
we
are
assured
he
designed
his
work
for
a
complete
body
of
all
knowledge
,
human
,
divine
,
political
,
and
mechanic
<EOS>
,
it
is
manifest
he
hath
wholly
neglected
some
,
and
been
very
imperfect
perfect
in
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
first
of
all
,
as
eminent
a
cabalist
as
his
disciples
would
represent
him
,
his
account
of
the
opus
magnum
is
extremely
poor
and
deficient
;
he
seems
to
have
read
but
very
superficially
either
Sendivogus
,
Behmen
,
or
Anthroposophia
Theomagica
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
also
quite
mistaken
about
the
sphaera
pyroplastica
,
a
neglect
not
to
be
atoned
for
,
and
(
if
the
reader
will
admit
so
severe
a
censure
)
<EOS>

<EOS>
His
failings
are
not
less
prominent
in
several
parts
of
the
mechanics
.
<EOS>
For
having
read
his
writings
with
the
utmost
application
usual
among
modern
wits
,
I
could
never
yet
discover
the
least
direction
about
the
structure
of
that
useful
instrument
a
save
-
all
;
for
want
of
which
,
if
the
moderns
had
not
lent
their
assistance
,
we
might
yet
have
wandered
in
the
dark
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
have
still
behind
a
fault
far
more
notorious
to
tax
this
author
with
;
I
mean
his
gross
ignorance
in
the
common
laws
of
this
realm
,
and
in
the
doctrine
as
well
as
discipline
of
the
Church
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
A
defect
,
indeed
,
for
which
both
he
and
all
the
ancients
stand
most
justly
censured
by
my
worthy
and
ingenious
friend
Mr.
Wotton
,
Bachelor
of
Divinity
,
in
his
incomparable
treatise
of
ancient
and
modern
learning
;
a
book
never
to
be
sufficiently
valued
,
whether
we
consider
the
happy
turns
and
flowings
of
the
author
's
wit
,
the
great
usefulness
of
his
sublime
discoveries
upon
the
subject
of
flies
and
spittle
,
or
the
laborious
eloquence
of
his
style
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
can
not
forbear
doing
that
author
the
justice
of
my
public
acknowledgments
for
the
great
helps
and
<EOS>
liftings
I
had
out
of
his
incomparable
piece
while
I
was
penning
this
treatise
.
  
<EOS>
But
besides
these
omissions
in
Homer
already
mentioned
,
the
curious
reader
will
also
observe
several
defects
in
that
author
's
writings
for
which
he
is
not
altogether
so
accountable
.
 
<EOS>
For
whereas
every
branch
of
knowledge
has
received
such
wonderful
acquirements
since
his
age
,
especially
within
these
last
three
years
or
thereabouts
,
it
is
almost
impossible
he
could
be
so
very
perfect
in
modern
discoveries
as
his
advocates
pretend
.
 
<EOS>
We
freely
acknowledge
him
to
be
the
inventor
of
the
compass
,
of
gunpowder
,
and
the
circulation
of
the
blood
;
but
I
challenge
any
of
his
admirers
to
show
me
in
all
his
writings
a
complete
account
of
the
spleen
.
 
<EOS>
Does
he
not
also
leave
us
wholly
to
seek
in
the
art
of
political
wagering
?
 
<EOS>
What
can
be
more
defective
and
unsatisfactory
than
his
long
dissertation
upon
tea
?
<EOS>
and
as
to
his
method
of
salivation
without
mercury
,
so
much
celebrated
of
late
,
it
is
to
my
own
knowledge
and
experience
a
thing
very
little
to
be
relied
on
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
to
supply
such
momentous
defects
that
I
have
been
prevailed
on
,
after
long
solicitation
,
to
take
pen
in
hand
,
and
I
dare
venture
to
promise
the
judicious
reader
<EOS>
shall
find
nothing
neglected
here
that
can
be
of
use
upon
any
emergency
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
confident
to
have
included
and
exhausted
all
that
human
imagination
can
rise
or
fall
to
.
 
<EOS>
Particularly
I
recommend
to
the
perusal
of
the
learned
certain
discoveries
that
are
wholly
untouched
by
others
<EOS>
,
whereof
I
shall
only
mention
,
among
a
great
many
more
,
my
"
New
Help
of
Smatterers
,
or
the
Art
of
being
Deep
Learned
and
Shallow
Read
,
"
"
A
Curious
Invention
about
Mouse
-
traps
,
"
"
A
Universal

,
or
Every
Man
his
own
Carver
,
"
together
with
a
most
useful
engine
for
catching
of
owls
.
 
<EOS>
All
which
the
judicious
reader
will
find
largely
treated
on
in
the
several
parts
of
this
discourse
.
  
<EOS>
I
hold
myself
obliged
to
give
as
much
light
as
possible
into
the
beauties
and
excellences
of
what
I
am
writing
,
because
it
is
become
the
fashion
and
humour
most
applauded
among
the
first
authors
of
this
polite
and
learned
age
,
when
they
would
correct
the
ill
nature
of
critical
or
inform
the
ignorance
of
courteous
readers
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
there
have
been
several
famous
pieces
lately
published
,
both
in
verse
and
prose
,
wherein
if
the
writers
had
not
been
pleased
,
out
of
their
great
humanity
and
affection
to
the
public
,
to
give
us
a
nice
detail
of
the
sublime
and
the
admirable
they
contain
,
it
is
a
thousand
to
one
whether
we
should
ever
have
discovered
one
grain
of
either
.
 
<EOS>
For
my
own
particular
,
I
can
not
deny
that
whatever
I
have
said
upon
this
occasion
had
been
more
proper
in
a
preface
,
and
more
agreeable
to
the
mode
which
usually
directs
it
there
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
here
think
fit
to
lay
hold
on
that
great
and
honourable
privilege
of
being
the
last
writer
.
 
<EOS>
I
claim
an
absolute
authority
in
right
as
the
freshest
modern
,
which
gives
me
a
despotic
power
over
all
authors
before
me
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
strength
of
which
title
I
do
utterly
disapprove
and
declare
against
that
pernicious
custom
of
making
the
preface
a
bill
of
fare
to
the
book
.
 
<EOS>
For
I
have
always
looked
upon
it
as
a
high
point
of
indiscretion
in
monstermongers
and
other
retailers
of
strange
sights
to
hang
out
a
fair
large
picture
over
the
door
,
drawn
after
the
life
,
with
a
most
eloquent
description
underneath
.
 
<EOS>
This
has
saved
me
many
a
threepence
,
for
my
curiosity
was
fully
satisfied
,
and
I
never
offered
to
go
in
,
though
often
invited
by
the
urging
and
attending
orator
with
his
last
moving
and
standing
piece
of
rhetoric
,
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
upon
my
word
,
we
are
just
going
to
begin
.
"
 
<EOS>
Such
is
exactly
the
fate
at
this
time
of
Prefaces
,
Epistles
,
Advertisements
,
Introductions
,
Prolegomenas
,
Apparatuses
,
To
the
Readers
's
.
 
<EOS>
This
expedient
was
admirable
at
first
;
our
great
Dryden
has
long
carried
it
as
far
as
it
would
go
,
and
with
incredible
success
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
often
said
to
me
in
confidence
that
the
world
would
never
have
suspected
him
to
be
so
great
a
poet
if
he
had
not
assured
them
so
frequently
in
his
prefaces
,
that
it
was
impossible
they
could
either
doubt
or
forget
it
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
may
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
I
much
fear
his
instructions
have
edified
out
of
their
place
,
and
taught
men
to
grow
wiser
in
certain
points
where
he
never
intended
they
should
;
for
it
is
lamentable
to
behold
with
what
a
lazy
scorn
many
of
the
yawning
readers
in
our
age
do
now
-
a
-
days
twirl
over
forty
or
fifty
pages
of
preface
and
dedication
(
which
is
the
usual
modern
stint
)
,
as
if
it
were
so
much
Latin
.
 
<EOS>
Though
it
must
be
also
allowed
,
on
the
other
hand
,
that
a
very
considerable
number
is
known
to
proceed
critics
and
wits
by
reading
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
Into
which
two
factions
<EOS>
I
think
all
present
readers
may
justly
be
divided
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
for
myself
,
I
profess
to
be
of
the
former
sort
,
and
therefore
having
the
modern
inclination
to
expatiate
upon
the
beauty
of
my
own
productions
,
and
display
the
bright
parts
of
my
discourse
,
I
thought
best
to
do
it
in
the
body
of
the
work
,
where
as
it
now
lies
it
makes
a
very
considerable
addition
to
the
bulk
of
the
volume
,
a
circumstance
by
no
means
to
be
neglected
by
a
skilful
writer
.
  
<EOS>
Having
thus
paid
my
due
deference
and
acknowledgment
to
an
established
custom
of
our
newest
authors
,
by
a
long
digression
unsought
for
and
a
universal
censure
unprovoked
,
by
forcing
into
the
light
,
with
much
pains
and
dexterity
,
my
own
excellences
and
other
men
's
defaults
,
with
great
justice
to
myself
and
candour
to
them
,
I
now
happily
resume
my
subject
,
to
the
infinite
satisfaction
both
of
the
reader
and
the
author
.
  
<EOS>
SECTION
VI
.
 
<EOS>
A
TALE
OF
A
TUB
.
  
<EOS>
We
left
Lord
Peter
in
open
rupture
with
his
two
brethren
,
both
for
ever
discarded
from
his
house
,
and
resigned
to
the
wide
world
with
little
or
nothing
to
trust
to
.
 
<EOS>
Which
are
circumstances
that
render
them
proper
subjects
for
the
charity
of
a
writer
's
pen
to
work
on
,
scenes
of
misery
ever
affording
the
fairest
harvest
for
great
adventures
.
 
<EOS>
And
in
this
the
world
may
perceive
the
difference
between
the
integrity
of
a
generous
Author
and
that
of
a
common
friend
.
 
<EOS>
The
latter
is
observed
to
adhere
close
in
prosperity
,
but
on
the
decline
of
fortune
to
drop
suddenly
off
;
whereas
the
generous
author
,
just
on
the
contrary
,
finds
his
hero
on
the
dunghill
,
from
thence
,
by
gradual
steps
,
raises
him
to
a
throne
,
and
then
immediately
withdraws
,
expecting
not
so
much
as
thanks
for
his
pains
;
in
imitation
of
which
example
I
have
placed
Lord
Peter
in
a
noble
house
,
<EOS>
given
him
a
title
to
wear
and
money
to
spend
.
 
<EOS>
There
I
shall
leave
him
for
some
time
,
returning
,
where
common
charity
directs
me
,
to
the
assistance
of
his
two
brothers
at
their
lowest
ebb
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
I
shall
by
no
means
<EOS>
forget
my
character
of
a
historian
,
to
follow
the
truth
step
by
step
whatever
happens
,
or
wherever
it
may
lead
me
.
  
<EOS>
The
two
exiles
so
nearly
united
in
fortune
and
interest
took
a
lodging
together
,
where
at
their
first
leisure
they
began
to
reflect
on
the
numberless
misfortunes
and
vexations
of
their
life
past
,
and
could
not
tell
of
the
sudden
to
what
failure
in
their
conduct
they
ought
to
impute
them
,
when
,
after
some
recollection
,
they
called
to
mind
the
copy
of
their
father
's
will
which
they
had
so
happily
recovered
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
immediately
produced
,
and
a
firm
resolution
taken
between
them
to
alter
whatever
was
already
amiss
,
and
reduce
all
their
future
measures
to
the
strictest
obedience
prescribed
therein
.
 
<EOS>
The
main
body
of
the
will
(
as
the
reader
can
not
easily
have
forgot
)
consisted
in
certain
admirable
rules
,
about
the
wearing
of
their
coats
<EOS>
,
in
the
perusal
whereof
the
two
brothers
at
every
period
duly
comparing
the
doctrine
with
the
practice
,
there
was
never
seen
a
wider
difference
between
two
things
,
horrible
downright
transgressions
of
every
point
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
which
they
both
resolved
without
further
delay
to
fall
immediately
upon
reducing
the
whole
exactly
after
their
father
's
model
.
  
<EOS>
But
here
it
is
good
to
stop
the
hasty
reader
,
ever
impatient
to
see
the
end
of
an
adventure
before
we
writers
can
duly
prepare
him
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
to
record
that
these
two
brothers
began
to
be
distinguished
at
this
time
by
certain
names
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
them
desired
to
be
called
Martin
,
and
the
other
took
the
appellation
of
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
These
two
had
lived
in
much
friendship
and
agreement
under
the
tyranny
of
their
brother
Peter
,
as
it
is
the
talent
of
fellow
-
sufferers
to
do
,
men
in
misfortune
being
like
men
in
the
dark
,
to
whom
all
colours
are
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
they
came
forward
into
the
world
,
and
began
to
display
themselves
to
each
other
and
to
the
light
,
their
complexions
appeared
extremely
different
,
which
the
present
posture
of
their
affairs
gave
them
sudden
opportunity
to
discover
.
  
<EOS>
But
here
the
severe
reader
may
justly
tax
me
as
a
writer
of
short
memory
,
a
deficiency
to
which
a
true
modern
<EOS>
can
not
but
of
necessity
be
a
little
subject
.
 
<EOS>
Because
,
memory
being
an
employment
of
the
mind
upon
things
past
,
is
a
faculty
for
which
the
learned
in
our
illustrious
age
have
no
manner
of
occasion
,
who
deal
entirely
with
invention
and
strike
all
things
out
of
themselves
,
or
at
least
by
collision
from
each
other
;
upon
which
account
,
we
think
it
highly
reasonable
to
produce
our
great
forgetfulness
as
an
argument
unanswerable
for
our
great
wit
.
 
<EOS>
I
ought
in
method
to
have
informed
the
reader
about
fifty
pages
ago
of
a
fancy
Lord
Peter
took
,
and
infused
into
his
brothers
,
to
wear
on
their
coats
whatever
trimmings
came
up
in
fashion
,
never
pulling
off
any
as
they
went
out
of
the
mode
,
but
keeping
on
all
together
,
which
amounted
in
time
to
a
medley
the
most
antic
you
can
possibly
conceive
,
and
this
to
a
degree
that
,
upon
the
time
of
their
falling
out
,
there
was
hardly
a
thread
of
the
original
coat
to
be
seen
,
but
an
infinite
quantity
of
lace
,
and
ribbands
,
and
fringe
,
and
embroidery
,
and
points
(
I
mean
only
those
tagged
with
silver
,
for
the
rest
fell
off
)
.
 
<EOS>
Now
this
material
circumstance
having
been
forgot
in
due
place
,
as
good
fortune
hath
ordered
,
comes
in
very
properly
here
,
when
the
two
brothers
are
just
going
to
reform
their
vestures
into
the
primitive
state
prescribed
by
their
father
's
will
.
  
<EOS>
They
both
unanimously
entered
upon
this
great
work
,
looking
sometimes
on
their
coats
and
sometimes
on
the
will
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
laid
the
first
hand
;
at
one
twitch
brought
off
a
large
handful
of
points
,
and
with
a
second
pull
stripped
away
ten
dozen
yards
of
fringe
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
he
had
gone
thus
far
he
demurred
a
while
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
very
well
<EOS>
there
yet
remained
a
great
deal
more
to
be
done
;
however
,
the
first
heat
being
over
,
his
violence
began
to
cool
,
and
he
resolved
to
proceed
more
moderately
in
the
rest
of
the
work
,
having
already
very
narrowly
escaped
a
swinging
rent
in
pulling
off
the
points
,
which
being
tagged
with
silver
(
as
we
have
observed
before
)
,
the
judicious
workman
had
with
much
sagacity
double
sewn
to
preserve
them
from
falling
.
 
<EOS>
Resolving
therefore
to
rid
his
coat
of
a
huge
quantity
of
gold
lace
,
he
picked
up
the
stitches
with
much
caution
and
diligently
gleaned
out
all
the
loose
threads
as
he
went
,
which
proved
to
be
a
work
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
fell
about
the
embroidered
Indian
figures
of
men
,
women
,
and
children
,
against
which
,
as
you
have
heard
in
its
due
place
,
their
father
's
testament
was
extremely
exact
and
severe
.
 
<EOS>
These
,
with
much
dexterity
and
application
,
were
after
a
while
quite
eradicated
or
utterly
defaced
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
rest
,
where
he
observed
the
embroidery
to
be
worked
so
close
as
not
to
be
got
away
without
damaging
the
cloth
,
or
where
it
served
to
hide
or
strengthened
any
flaw
in
the
body
of
the
coat
,
contracted
by
the
perpetual
tampering
of
workmen
upon
it
,
he
concluded
the
wisest
course
was
to
let
it
remain
,
resolving
in
no
case
whatsoever
that
the
substance
of
the
stuff
should
suffer
injury
,
which
he
thought
the
best
method
for
serving
the
true
intent
and
meaning
of
his
father
's
will
.
 
<EOS>
And
this
is
the
nearest
account
I
have
been
able
to
collect
of
Martin
's
proceedings
upon
this
great
revolution
.
  
<EOS>
But
his
brother
Jack
,
whose
adventures
will
be
so
extraordinary
as
to
furnish
a
great
part
in
the
remainder
of
this
discourse
,
entered
upon
the
matter
with
other
thoughts
and
a
quite
different
spirit
.
<EOS>
For
the
memory
of
Lord
Peter
's
injuries
produced
a
degree
of
hatred
and
spite
which
had
a
much
greater
share
of
inciting
him
than
any
regards
after
his
father
's
commands
,
since
these
appeared
at
best
only
secondary
and
subservient
to
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
for
this
medley
of
humour
he
made
a
shift
to
find
a
very
plausible
name
,
honouring
it
with
the
title
of
zeal
,
which
is
,
perhaps
,
the
most
significant
word
that
has
been
ever
yet
produced
in
any
language
,
as
<EOS>
,
I
think
,
I
have
fully
proved
in
my
excellent
analytical
discourse
upon
that
subject
,
wherein
I
have
deduced
a
histori
-
theo-
physiological
account
of
zeal
,
showing
how
it
first
proceeded
from
a
notion
into
a
word
,
and
from
thence
in
a
hot
summer
ripened
into
a
tangible
substance
.
 
<EOS>
This
work
,
containing
three
large
volumes
in
folio
<EOS>
,
I
design
very
shortly
to
publish
by
the
modern
way
of
subscription
,
not
doubting
but
the
nobility
and
gentry
of
the
land
will
give
me
all
possible
encouragement
,
having
already
had
such
a
taste
of
what
I
am
able
to
perform
.
  
<EOS>
I
record
,
therefore
,
that
brother
Jack
,
brimful
of
this
miraculous
compound
,
reflecting
with
indignation
upon
Peter
's
tyranny
,
and
further
provoked
by
the
despondency
of
Martin
,
prefaced
his
resolutions
to
this
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
"
said
he
,
"
a
rogue
that
locked
up
his
drink
,
turned
away
our
wives
,
cheated
us
of
our
fortunes
,
palmed
his
crusts
upon
us
for
mutton
,
and
at
last
kicked
us
out
of
doors
;
must
we
be
in
his
fashions
?
 
<EOS>
A
rascal
,
besides
,
that
all
the
street
cries
out
against
.
"
 
<EOS>
Having
thus
kindled
and
inflamed
himself
as
high
as
possible
,
and
by
consequence
in
a
delicate
temper
for
beginning
a
reformation
,
he
set
about
the
work
immediately
,
and
in
three
minutes
made
more
dispatch
than
Martin
had
done
in
as
many
hours
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
courteous
reader
,
you
are
given
to
understand
that
zeal
is
never
so
highly
obliged
as
when
you
set
it
a
-
tearing
;
and
Jack
,
who
doted
on
that
quality
in
himself
,
allowed
it
at
this
time
its
full
swing
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
it
happened
that
,
stripping
down
a
parcel
of
gold
lace
a
little
too
hastily
,
he
rent
the
main
body
of
his
coat
from
top
to
bottom
;
and
whereas
his
talent
was
not
of
the
happiest
in
taking
up
a
stitch
,
he
knew
no
better
way
than
to
darn
it
again
with
packthread
thread
and
a
skewer
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
matter
was
yet
infinitely
worse
<EOS>
(
I
record
it
with
tears
)
when
he
proceeded
to
the
embroidery
;
for
being
clumsy
of
nature
,
and
of
temper
impatient
withal
,
beholding
millions
of
stitches
that
required
the
nicest
hand
and
sedatest
constitution
to
extricate
,
in
a
great
rage
he
tore
off
the
whole
piece
,
cloth
and
all
,
and
flung
it
into
the
kennel
,
and
furiously
thus
continuing
his
career
,
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
good
brother
Martin
,
"
said
he
,
"
do
as
I
do
,
for
the
love
of
God
;
strip
,
tear
,
pull
,
rend
,
flay
off
all
that
we
may
appear
as
unlike
that
rogue
Peter
as
it
is
possible
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
for
a
hundred
pounds
carry
the
least
mark
about
me
that
might
give
occasion
to
the
neighbours
of
suspecting
I
was
related
to
such
a
rascal
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
Martin
,
who
at
this
time
happened
to
be
extremely
phlegmatic
and
sedate
,
begged
his
brother
,
of
all
love
,
not
to
damage
his
coat
by
any
means
,
for
he
never
would
get
such
another
;
desired
him
to
consider
that
it
was
not
their
business
to
form
their
actions
by
any
reflection
upon
Peter
's
,
but
by
observing
the
rules
prescribed
in
their
father
's
will
.
 
<EOS>
That
he
should
remember
Peter
was
still
their
brother
,
whatever
faults
or
injuries
he
had
committed
,
and
therefore
they
should
by
all
means
avoid
such
a
thought
as
that
of
taking
measures
for
good
and
evil
from
no
other
rule
than
of
opposition
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
That
it
was
true
the
testament
of
their
good
father
<EOS>
was
very
exact
in
what
related
to
the
wearing
of
their
coats
;
yet
was
it
no
less
penal
and
strict
in
prescribing
agreement
,
and
friendship
,
and
affection
between
them
.
<EOS>
And
therefore
,
if
straining
a
point
were
at
all
defensible
,
it
would
certainly
be
so
rather
to
the
advance
of
unity
than
increase
of
contradiction
.
  
<EOS>
Martin
had
still
proceeded
as
gravely
as
he
began
,
and
doubtless
would
have
delivered
an
admirable
lecture
of
morality
,
which
might
have
exceedingly
contributed
to
my
reader
's
repose
both
of
body
and
mind
(
the
true
ultimate
end
of
ethics
)
,
but
Jack
was
already
gone
a
flight
-
shot
beyond
his
patience
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
in
scholastic
disputes
nothing
serves
to
rouse
the
spleen
of
him
that
opposes
so
much
as
a
kind
of
pedantic
affected
calmness
in
the
respondent
,
disputants
being
for
the
most
part
like
unequal
scales
,
where
the
gravity
of
one
side
advances
the
lightness
of
the
other
,
and
causes
it
to
fly
up
and
kick
the
beam
;
so
it
happened
here
that
the
weight
of
Martin
's
arguments
exalted
Jack
's
levity
,
and
made
him
fly
out
and
spurn
against
his
brother
's
moderation
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
Martin
's
patience
put
Jack
in
a
rage
;
but
that
which
most
afflicted
him
was
to
observe
his
brother
's
coat
so
well
reduced
into
the
state
of
innocence
,
while
his
own
was
either
wholly
rent
to
his
shirt
,
or
those
places
which
had
escaped
his
cruel
clutches
were
still
in
Peter
's
livery
.
<EOS>
So
that
he
looked
like
a
drunken
beau
half
rifled
by
bullies
,
or
like
a
fresh
tenant
of
Newgate
when
he
has
refused
the
payment
of
garnish
,
or
like
a
discovered
shoplifter
left
to
the
mercy
of
Exchange
-
women
,
or
like
a
bawd
in
her
old
velvet
petticoat
resigned
into
the
secular
hands
of
the
mobile
.
 
<EOS>
Like
any
or
like
all
of
these
,
a
medley
of
rags
,
and
lace
,
and
fringes
,
unfortunate
Jack
did
now
appear
;
he
would
have
been
extremely
glad
to
see
his
coat
in
the
condition
of
Martin
's
,
but
infinitely
gladder
to
find
that
of
Martin
in
the
same
predicament
with
his
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
since
neither
of
these
was
likely
to
come
to
pass
,
he
thought
fit
to
lend
the
whole
business
another
turn
,
and
to
dress
up
necessity
into
a
virtue
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
after
as
many
of
the
fox
's
arguments
as
he
could
muster
up
for
bringing
Martin
to
reason
,
as
he
called
it
,
or
as
he
meant
it
,
into
his
own
ragged
,
bobtailed
condition
,
and
observing
he
said
all
to
little
purpose
,
<EOS>
what
alas
!
<EOS>
was
left
for
the
forlorn
Jack
to
do
,
but
,
after
a
million
of
scurrilities
against
his
brother
,
to
run
mad
with
spleen
,
and
spite
,
and
contradiction
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
short
,
here
began
a
mortal
breach
between
these
two
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
went
immediately
to
new
lodgings
,
and
in
a
few
days
it
was
for
certain
reported
that
he
had
run
out
of
his
wits
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
short
time
after
he
appeared
abroad
,
and
confirmed
the
report
by
falling
into
the
oddest
whimsies
that
ever
a
sick
brain
conceived
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
the
little
boys
in
the
streets
began
to
salute
him
with
several
names
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
they
would
call
him
Jack
the
Bald
,
sometimes
Jack
with
a
Lanthorn
,
sometimes
Dutch
Jack
,
sometimes
French
Hugh
,
sometimes
Tom
the
Beggar
,
and
sometimes
Knocking
Jack
of
the
North
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
was
under
one
or
some
or
all
of
these
appellations
(
which
I
leave
the
learned
reader
to
determine
)
<EOS>
that
he
hath
given
rise
to
the
most
illustrious
and
epidemic
sect
of
AEolists
,
who
,
with
honourable
commemoration
,
do
still
acknowledge
the
renowned
Jack
for
their
author
and
founder
.
 
<EOS>
Of
whose
originals
as
well
as
principles
I
am
now
advancing
to
gratify
the
world
with
a
very
particular
account
.

SECTION
VII
.
 
<EOS>
A
DIGRESSION
IN
PRAISE
OF
DIGRESSIONS
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
sometimes
heard
of
an
Iliad
in
a
nut
-
shell
,
but
it
has
been
my
fortune
to
have
much
oftener
seen
a
nut
-
shell
in
an
Iliad
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
doubt
that
human
life
has
received
most
wonderful
advantages
from
both
;
but
to
which
of
the
two
<EOS>
the
world
is
chiefly
indebted
,
I
shall
leave
among
the
curious
as
a
problem
worthy
of
their
utmost
inquiry
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
invention
of
the
latter
,
I
think
the
commonwealth
of
learning
is
chiefly
obliged
to
the
great
modern
improvement
of
digressions
.
 
<EOS>
The
late
refinements
in
knowledge
,
running
parallel
to
those
of
diet
in
our
nation
,
which
among
men
of
a
judicious
taste
are
dressed
up
in
various
compounds
,
consisting
in
soups
and
olios
,
fricassees
and
ragouts
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
true
there
is
a
sort
of
morose
,
detracting
,
ill
-
bred
people
who
pretend
utterly
to
disrelish
these
polite
innovations
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
to
the
similitude
from
diet
,
they
allow
the
parallel
,
but
are
so
bold
as
to
pronounce
the
example
itself
a
corruption
and
degeneracy
of
taste
.
 
<EOS>
They
tell
us
that
the
fashion
of
jumbling
fifty
things
together
in
a
dish
was
at
first
introduced
in
compliance
to
a
depraved
and
debauched
appetite
,
as
well
as
to
a
crazy
constitution
,
and
to
see
a
man
hunting
through
an
olio
after
the
head
and
brains
of
a
goose
,
a
widgeon
,
or
a
woodcock
,
is
a
sign
he
wants
a
stomach
and
digestion
for
more
substantial
victuals
.
 
<EOS>
Further
,
they
affirm
that
digressions
in
a
book
are
like
foreign
troops
in
a
state
,
which
argue
the
nation
to
want
a
heart
and
hands
of
its
own
,
and
often
either
subdue
the
natives
,
or
drive
them
into
the
most
unfruitful
corners
.
  
<EOS>
But
after
all
that
can
be
objected
by
these
supercilious
censors
,
it
is
manifest
the
society
of
writers
would
quickly
be
reduced
to
a
very
inconsiderable
number
if
men
were
put
upon
making
books
with
the
fatal
confinement
of
delivering
nothing
beyond
what
is
to
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
acknowledged
that
were
the
case
the
same
among
us
as
with
the
Greeks
and
Romans
,
when
learning
was
in
its
cradle
,
to
be
reared
and
fed
and
clothed
by
invention
,
it
would
be
an
easy
task
to
fill
up
volumes
upon
particular
occasions
without
further
expatiating
from
the
subject
than
by
moderate
excursions
,
helping
to
advance
or
clear
the
main
design
.
 
<EOS>
But
with
knowledge
it
has
fared
as
with
a
numerous
army
encamped
in
a
fruitful
country
,
which
for
a
few
days
maintains
itself
by
the
product
of
the
soil
it
is
on
,
till
provisions
being
spent
,
they
send
to
forage
many
a
mile
among
friends
or
enemies
,
it
matters
not
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
the
neighbouring
fields
,
trampled
and
beaten
down
,
become
barren
and
dry
,
affording
no
sustenance
but
clouds
of
dust
.
  
<EOS>
The
whole
course
of
things
being
thus
entirely
changed
between
us
and
the
ancients
,
and
the
moderns
wisely
sensible
of
it
,
we
of
this
age
have
discovered
a
shorter
and
more
prudent
method
to
become
scholars
and
wits
,
without
the
fatigue
of
reading
or
of
thinking
.
<EOS>
The
most
accomplished
way
of
using
books
at
present
is
twofold
:
either
first
to
serve
them
as
some
men
do
lords
,
learn
their
titles
exactly
,
and
then
brag
of
their
acquaintance
;
or
,
secondly
,
which
is
indeed
the
choicer
,
the
profounder
,
and
politer
method
,
to
get
a
thorough
insight
into
the
index
by
which
the
whole
book
is
governed
and
turned
,
like
fishes
by
the
tail
.
 
<EOS>
For
to
enter
the
palace
of
learning
at
the
great
gate
requires
an
expense
of
time
and
forms
,
therefore
men
of
much
haste
and
little
ceremony
are
content
to
get
in
by
the
back
-
door
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
arts
are
all
in
a
flying
march
,
and
therefore
more
easily
subdued
by
attacking
them
in
the
rear
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
physicians
discover
the
state
of
the
whole
body
by
consulting
only
what
comes
from
behind
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
men
catch
knowledge
by
throwing
their
wit
on
the
posteriors
of
a
book
,
as
boys
do
sparrows
with
flinging
salt
upon
their
tails
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
human
life
is
best
understood
by
the
wise
man
's
rule
of
regarding
the
end
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
are
the
sciences
found
,
like
Hercules
'
oxen
,
by
tracing
them
backwards
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
are
old
sciences
unravelled
like
old
stockings
,
by
beginning
at
the
foot
.
  
<EOS>
Besides
all
this
,
the
army
of
the
sciences
hath
been
of
late
with
a
world
of
martial
discipline
drawn
into
its
close
order
,
so
that
a
view
or
a
muster
may
be
taken
of
it
with
abundance
of
expedition
.
<EOS>
For
this
great
blessing
we
are
wholly
indebted
to
systems
and
abstracts
,
in
which
the
modern
fathers
of
learning
,
like
prudent
usurers
,
spent
their
sweat
for
the
ease
of
us
their
children
.
 
<EOS>
For
labour
is
the
seed
of
idleness
,
and
it
is
the
peculiar
happiness
of
our
noble
age
to
gather
the
fruit
.
  
<EOS>
Now
the
method
of
growing
wise
,
learned
,
and
sublime
having
become
so
regular
an
affair
,
and
so
established
in
all
its
forms
,
the
number
of
writers
must
needs
have
increased
accordingly
,
and
to
a
pitch
that
has
made
it
of
absolute
necessity
for
them
to
interfere
continually
with
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
it
is
reckoned
that
there
is
not
at
this
present
a
sufficient
quantity
of
new
matter
left
in
Nature
to
furnish
and
adorn
any
one
particular
subject
to
the
extent
of
a
volume
.
 
<EOS>
This
<EOS>
I
am
told
by
a
very
skilful
computer
,
who
hath
given
a
full
demonstration
of
it
from
rules
of
arithmetic
.
  
<EOS>
This
perhaps
may
be
objected
against
by
those
who
maintain
the
infinity
of
matter
,
and
therefore
will
not
allow
that
any
species
of
it
can
be
exhausted
.
 
<EOS>
For
answer
to
which
,
let
us
examine
the
noblest
branch
of
modern
wit
or
invention
planted
and
cultivated
by
the
present
age
,
and
which
of
all
others
hath
borne
the
most
and
the
fairest
fruit
.
 
<EOS>
For
though
some
remains
of
it
were
left
us
by
the
ancients
,
yet
have
not
any
of
those
,
as
I
remember
,
been
translated
or
compiled
into
systems
for
modern
use
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
we
may
affirm
,
to
our
own
honour
,
that
it
has
in
some
sort
been
both
invented
and
brought
to
a
perfection
by
the
same
hands
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
mean
is
,
that
highly
celebrated
talent
among
the
modern
wits
of
deducing
similitudes
,
allusions
,
and
applications
,
very
surprising
,
agreeable
,
and
apposite
,
from
the
signs
of
either
sex
,
together
with
their
proper
uses
.
 
<EOS>
And
truly
,
having
observed
how
little
invention
bears
any
vogue
besides
what
is
derived
into
these
channels
,
I
have
sometimes
had
a
thought
that
the
happy
genius
of
our
age
and
country
was
prophetically
held
forth
by
that
ancient
typical
description
of
the
Indian
pigmies
whose
stature
did
not
exceed
above
two
feet
,
sed
quorum
pudenda
crassa
,
et
ad
talos
usque
pertingentia
.
 
<EOS>
Now
I
have
been
very
curious
to
inspect
the
late
productions
,
wherein
the
beauties
of
this
kind
have
most
prominently
appeared
.
 
<EOS>
And
although
this
vein
hath
bled
so
freely
,
and
all
endeavours
have
been
used
in
the
power
of
human
breath
to
dilate
,
extend
,
and
keep
it
open
,
like
the
Scythians
,
who
had
a
custom
and
an
instrument
to
blow
up
those
parts
of
their
mares
,
that
they
might
yield
the
more
milk
;
yet
I
am
under
an
apprehension
it
is
near
growing
dry
and
past
all
recovery
,
and
that
either
some
new
fonde
of
wit
should
,
if
possible
,
be
provided
,
or
else
that
we
must
e'en
be
content
with
repetition
here
as
well
as
upon
all
other
occasions
.
  
<EOS>
This
will
stand
as
an
uncontestable
argument
that
our
modern
wits
are
not
to
reckon
upon
the
infinity
of
matter
for
a
constant
supply
.
<EOS>
What
remains
,
therefore
,
but
that
our
last
recourse
must
be
had
to
large
indexes
and
little
compendiums
?
 
<EOS>
Quotations
must
be
plentifully
gathered
and
booked
in
alphabet
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
end
,
though
authors
need
be
little
consulted
,
yet
critics
,
and
commentators
,
and
lexicons
carefully
must
.
 
<EOS>
But
above
all
,
those
judicious
collectors
of
bright
parts
,
and
flowers
,
and
observandas
are
to
be
nicely
dwelt
on
by
some
called
the
sieves
and
boulters
of
learning
,
though
it
is
left
undetermined
whether
they
dealt
in
pearls
or
meal
,
and
consequently
whether
we
are
more
to
value
that
which
passed
through
or
what
stayed
behind
.
  
<EOS>
By
these
methods
,
in
a
few
weeks
there
starts
up
many
a
writer
capable
of
managing
the
profoundest
and
most
universal
subjects
.
<EOS>
For
what
though
his
head
be
empty
,
provided
his
commonplace
book
be
full
?
 
<EOS>
And
if
you
will
bate
him
but
the
circumstances
of
method
,
and
style
,
and
grammar
,
and
invention
;
allow
him
but
the
common
privileges
of
transcribing
from
others
,
and
digressing
from
himself
as
often
as
he
shall
see
occasion
,
he
will
desire
no
more
ingredients
towards
fitting
up
a
treatise
that
shall
make
a
very
comely
figure
on
a
bookseller
's
shelf
,
there
to
be
preserved
neat
and
clean
for
a
long
eternity
,
adorned
with
the
heraldry
of
its
title
fairly
inscribed
on
a
label
,
never
to
be
thumbed
or
greased
by
students
,
nor
bound
to
everlasting
chains
of
darkness
in
a
library
,
but
when
the
fulness
of
time
is
come
shall
happily
undergo
the
trial
of
purgatory
in
order
to
ascend
the
sky
.
  
<EOS>
Without
these
allowances
how
is
it
possible
we
modern
wits
should
ever
have
an
opportunity
to
introduce
our
collections
listed
under
so
many
thousand
heads
of
a
different
nature
,
for
want
of
which
the
learned
world
would
be
deprived
of
infinite
delight
as
well
as
instruction
,
and
we
ourselves
buried
beyond
redress
in
an
inglorious
and
undistinguished
oblivion
?
  
<EOS>
From
such
elements
as
these
I
am
alive
to
behold
the
day
wherein
the
corporation
of
authors
can
outvie
all
its
brethren
in
the
field
 
a
happiness
derived
to
us
,
with
a
great
many
others
,
from
our
Scythian
ancestors
,
among
whom
the
number
of
pens
was
so
infinite
that
the
Grecian
eloquence
had
no
other
way
of
expressing
it
than
by
saying
that
in
the
regions
far
to
the
north
it
was
hardly
possible
for
a
man
to
travel
,
the
very
air
was
so
replete
with
feathers
.
  
<EOS>
The
necessity
of
this
digression
will
easily
excuse
the
length
,
and
I
have
chosen
for
it
as
proper
a
place
as
I
could
readily
find
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
judicious
reader
can
assign
a
fitter
,
I
do
here
empower
him
to
remove
it
into
any
other
corner
he
please
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
I
return
with
great
alacrity
to
pursue
a
more
important
concern
.
  
<EOS>
SECTION
VIII
.
 
<EOS>
A
TALE
OF
A
TUB
.
  
<EOS>
The
learned
<EOS>
AEolists
maintain
the
original
cause
of
all
things
to
be
wind
,
from
which
principle
this
whole
universe
was
at
first
produced
,
and
into
which
it
must
at
last
be
resolved
,
that
the
same
breath
which
had
kindled
and
blew
up
the
flame
of
Nature
should
one
day
blow
it
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
Quod
procul
<EOS>
a
nobis
flectat
Fortuna
gubernans
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
is
what
the
Adepti
understand
by
their
anima
mundi
,
that
is
to
say
,
the
spirit
,
or
breath
,
or
wind
of
the
world
;
or
examine
the
whole
system
by
the
particulars
of
Nature
,
and
you
will
find
it
not
to
be
disputed
.
 
<EOS>
For
whether
you
please
to
call
the
forma
informans
of
man
by
the
name
of
spiritus
,
animus
,
afflatus
,
or
anima
<EOS>
,
what
are
all
these
but
several
appellations
for
wind
,
which
is
the
ruling
element
in
every
compound
,
and
into
which
they
all
resolve
upon
their
corruption
.
 
<EOS>
Further
,
what
is
life
itself
but
,
as
it
is
commonly
called
,
the
breath
of
our
nostrils
,
whence
<EOS>
it
is
very
justly
observed
by
naturalists
that
wind
still
continues
of
great
emolument
in
certain
mysteries
not
to
be
named
,
giving
occasion
for
those
happy
epithets
of
turgidus
and
inflatus
,
applied
either
to
the
emittent
or
recipient
organs
.
  
<EOS>
By
what
I
have
gathered
out
of
ancient
records
,
I
find
the
compass
of
their
doctrine
took
in
two
-
and
-
thirty
points
,
wherein
it
would
be
tedious
to
be
very
particular
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
a
few
of
their
most
important
precepts
deducible
from
it
are
by
no
means
to
be
omitted
;
among
which
,
the
following
maxim
was
of
much
weight
:
 
<EOS>
That
since
wind
had
the
master
share
as
well
as
operation
in
every
compound
,
by
consequence
those
beings
must
be
of
chief
excellence
wherein
that
primordium
appears
most
prominently
to
abound
,
and
therefore
man
is
in
highest
perfection
of
all
created
things
,
as
having
,
by
the
great
bounty
of
philosophers
,
been
endued
with
three
distinct
animas
or
winds
,
to
which
the
sage
AEolists
,
with
much
liberality
,
have
added
a
fourth
,
of
equal
necessity
as
well
as
ornament
with
the
other
three
,
by
this
quartum
principium
taking
in
the
four
corners
of
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
Which
gave
occasion
to
that
renowned
cabalist
Bombastus
 
of
placing
the
body
of
man
in
due
position
to
the
four
cardinal
points
.
  
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
this
,
their
next
principle
was
that
man
brings
with
him
into
the
world
a
peculiar
portion
or
grain
of
wind
,
which
may
be
called
a
quinta
essentia
extracted
from
the
other
four
.
 
<EOS>
This
quintessence
is
of
catholic
use
upon
all
emergencies
of
life
,
is
improveable
into
all
arts
and
sciences
,
and
may
be
wonderfully
refined
as
well
as
enlarged
by
certain
methods
in
education
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
when
blown
up
to
its
perfection
,
ought
not
to
be
covetously
boarded
up
,
stifled
,
or
hid
under
a
bushel
,
but
freely
communicated
to
mankind
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
these
reasons
,
and
others
of
equal
weight
,
the
wise
AEolists
affirm
the
gift
of
belching
to
be
the
noblest
act
of
a
rational
creature
.
 
<EOS>
To
cultivate
which
art
,
and
render
it
more
serviceable
to
mankind
,
they
made
use
of
several
methods
.
 
<EOS>
At
certain
seasons
of
the
year
you
might
behold
the
priests
amongst
them
in
vast
numbers
with
their
mouths
gaping
wide
against
a
storm
.
<EOS>
At
other
times
were
to
be
seen
several
hundreds
linked
together
in
a
circular
chain
,
with
every
man
a
pair
of
bellows
applied
to
his
neighbour
,
by
which
they
blew
up
each
other
to
the
shape
and
size
of
a
tun
;
and
for
that
reason
with
great
propriety
of
speech
did
usually
call
their
bodies
their
vessels
.
 
<EOS>
When
,
by
these
and
the
like
performances
,
they
were
grown
sufficiently
replete
,
they
would
immediately
depart
,
and
disembogue
for
the
public
good
a
plentiful
share
of
their
acquirements
into
their
disciples
'
chaps
.
<EOS>
For
we
must
here
observe
that
all
learning
was
esteemed
among
them
to
be
compounded
from
the
same
principle
.
 
<EOS>
Because
,
first
,
it
is
generally
affirmed
or
confessed
that
learning
puffeth
men
up
;
<EOS>
and
,
secondly
,
they
proved
it
by
the
following
syllogism
:
 
<EOS>
"
Words
are
but
wind
,
and
learning
is
nothing
but
words
;
ergo
,
learning
is
nothing
but
wind
.
"
 
<EOS>
For
this
reason
the
philosophers
among
them
did
in
their
schools
deliver
to
their
pupils
all
their
doctrines
and
opinions
by
eructation
,
wherein
they
had
acquired
a
wonderful
eloquence
,
and
of
incredible
variety
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
great
characteristic
by
which
their
chief
sages
were
best
distinguished
was
a
certain
position
of
countenance
,
which
gave
undoubted
intelligence
to
what
degree
or
proportion
the
spirit
agitated
the
inward
mass
.
 
<EOS>
For
after
certain
gripings
,
the
wind
and
vapours
issuing
forth
,
having
first
by
their
turbulence
and
convulsions
within
caused
an
earthquake
in
man
's
little
world
,
distorted
the
mouth
,
bloated
the
cheeks
,
and
gave
the
eyes
a
terrible
kind
of
relievo
.
 
<EOS>
At
which
junctures
all
their
belches
were
received
for
sacred
,
the
sourer
the
better
,
and
swallowed
with
infinite
consolation
by
their
meagre
devotees
.
 
<EOS>
And
to
render
these
yet
more
complete
,
because
the
breath
of
man
's
life
is
in
his
nostrils
,
therefore
the
choicest
,
most
edifying
,
and
most
enlivening
belches
were
very
wisely
conveyed
through
that
vehicle
to
give
them
a
tincture
as
they
passed
.
  
<EOS>
Their
gods
were
the
four
winds
,
whom
they
worshipped
as
the
spirits
that
pervade
and
enliven
the
universe
,
and
as
those
from
whom
alone
all
inspiration
can
properly
be
said
to
proceed
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
the
chief
of
these
,
to
whom
they
performed
the
adoration
of
Latria
,
was
the
Almighty
North
,
an
ancient
deity
,
whom
the
inhabitants
of
Megalopolis
in
Greece
had
likewise
in
highest
reverence
.
 
<EOS>
"
Omnium
deorum
Boream
maxime
celebrant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
god
,
though
endued
with
ubiquity
,
was
yet
supposed
by
the
profounder
AEolists
to
possess
one
peculiar
habitation
,
or
(
to
speak
in
form
)
<EOS>
a
caelum
empyraeum
<EOS>
,
wherein
he
was
more
intimately
present
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
situated
in
a
certain
region
well
known
to
the
ancient
Greeks
,
by
them
called
[
Greek
text
which
can
not
be
reproduced
]
,
the
Land
of
Darkness
.
 
<EOS>
And
although
many
controversies
have
arisen
upon
that
matter
,
yet
so
much
is
undisputed
,
that
from
a
region
of
the
like
denomination
the
most
refined
AEolists
have
borrowed
their
original
,
from
whence
in
every
age
the
zealous
among
their
priesthood
have
brought
over
their
choicest
inspiration
,
fetching
it
with
their
own
hands
from
the
fountain
-
head
in
certain
bladders
,
and
disploding
it
among
the
sectaries
in
all
nations
,
who
did
,
and
do
,
and
ever
will
,
daily
gasp
and
pant
after
it
.
  
<EOS>
Now
their
mysteries
and
rites
were
performed
in
this
manner
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
well
known
among
the
learned
that
the
virtuosos
of
former
ages
had
a
contrivance
for
carrying
and
preserving
winds
in
casks
or
barrels
,
which
was
of
great
assistance
upon
long
sea
-
voyages
,
and
the
loss
of
so
useful
an
art
at
present
is
very
much
to
be
lamented
,
<EOS>
though
,
I
know
not
how
,
with
great
negligence
omitted
by
Pancirollus
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
an
invention
ascribed
to
AEolus
himself
,
from
whom
this
sect
is
denominated
,
and
who
,
in
honour
of
their
founder
's
memory
,
have
to
this
day
preserved
great
numbers
of
those
barrels
,
<EOS>
whereof
they
fix
one
in
each
of
their
temples
,
first
beating
out
the
top
.
 
<EOS>
Into
this
barrel
upon
solemn
days
the
priest
enters
,
where
,
having
before
duly
prepared
himself
by
the
methods
already
described
,
a
secret
funnel
is
also
conveyed
to
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
,
which
admits
new
supplies
of
inspiration
from
a
northern
chink
or
cranny
.
 
<EOS>
Whereupon
you
behold
him
swell
immediately
to
the
shape
and
size
of
his
vessel
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
posture
he
disembogues
whole
tempests
upon
his
auditory
,
as
the
spirit
from
beneath
gives
him
utterance
,
which
issuing
ex
adytis
and
penetralibus
,
is
not
performed
without
much
pain
and
griping
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
wind
in
breaking
forth
deals
with
his
face
as
it
does
with
that
of
the
sea
,
first
blackening
,
then
wrinkling
,
and
at
last
bursting
it
into
a
foam
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
in
this
guise
<EOS>
the
sacred
AEolist
delivers
his
oracular
belches
to
his
panting
disciples
,
of
whom
some
are
greedily
gaping
after
the
sanctified
breath
,
others
are
all
the
while
hymning
out
the
praises
of
the
winds
,
and
gently
wafted
to
and
fro
by
their
own
humming
,
do
thus
represent
the
soft
breezes
of
their
deities
appeased
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
from
this
custom
of
the
priests
that
some
authors
maintain
these
AEolists
to
have
been
very
ancient
in
the
world
,
because
the
delivery
of
their
mysteries
,
which
I
have
just
now
mentioned
,
appears
exactly
the
same
with
that
of
other
ancient
oracles
,
whose
inspirations
were
owing
to
certain
subterraneous
effluviums
of
wind
delivered
with
the
same
pain
to
the
priest
,
and
much
about
the
same
influence
on
the
people
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
true
indeed
that
these
were
frequently
managed
and
directed
by
female
officers
,
whose
organs
were
understood
to
be
better
disposed
for
the
admission
of
those
oracular
gusts
,
as
entering
and
passing
up
through
a
receptacle
of
greater
capacity
,
and
causing
also
a
pruriency
by
the
way
,
such
as
with
due
management
has
been
refined
from
carnal
into
a
spiritual
ecstasy
.
 
<EOS>
And
to
strengthen
this
profound
conjecture
,
it
is
further
insisted
that
this
custom
of
female
priests
is
kept
up
still
in
certain
refined
colleges
of
our
modern
AEolists
,
who
are
agreed
to
receive
their
inspiration
,
derived
through
the
receptacle
aforesaid
,
like
their
ancestors
the
Sybils
.
  
<EOS>
And
whereas
the
mind
of
man
,
when
he
gives
the
spur
and
bridle
to
his
thoughts
,
does
never
stop
,
but
naturally
sallies
out
into
both
extremes
of
high
and
low
,
of
good
and
evil
,
his
first
flight
of
fancy
commonly
transports
him
to
ideas
of
what
is
most
perfect
,
finished
,
and
exalted
,
till
,
having
soared
out
of
his
own
reach
and
sight
,
not
well
perceiving
how
near
the
frontiers
of
height
and
depth
border
upon
each
other
,
with
the
same
course
and
wing
he
falls
down
plump
into
the
lowest
bottom
of
things
,
like
one
who
travels
the
east
into
the
west
,
or
like
a
straight
line
drawn
by
its
own
length
into
a
circle
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
a
tincture
of
malice
in
our
natures
makes
us
fond
of
furnishing
every
bright
idea
with
its
reverse
,
or
whether
reason
,
reflecting
upon
the
sum
of
things
,
can
,
like
the
sun
,
serve
only
to
enlighten
one
half
of
the
globe
,
leaving
the
other
half
by
necessity
under
shade
and
darkness
,
or
whether
fancy
,
flying
up
to
the
imagination
of
what
is
highest
and
best
,
becomes
over
-
short
,
and
spent
,
and
weary
,
and
suddenly
falls
,
like
a
dead
bird
of
paradise
,
to
the
ground
;
or
whether
,
after
all
these
metaphysical
conjectures
,
I
have
not
entirely
missed
the
true
reason
;
the
proposition
,
however
,
which
has
stood
me
in
so
much
circumstance
is
altogether
true
,
that
as
the
most
uncivilised
parts
of
mankind
have
some
way
or
other
climbed
up
into
the
conception
of
a
God
or
Supreme
Power
,
so
they
have
seldom
forgot
to
provide
their
fears
with
certain
ghastly
notions
,
which
,
instead
of
better
,
have
served
them
pretty
tolerably
for
a
devil
.
 
<EOS>
And
this
proceeding
seems
to
be
natural
enough
,
for
it
is
with
men
whose
imaginations
are
lifted
up
very
high
after
the
same
rate
as
with
those
whose
bodies
are
so
,
that
as
they
are
delighted
with
the
advantage
of
a
nearer
contemplation
upwards
,
so
they
are
equally
terrified
with
the
dismal
prospect
of
the
precipice
below
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
in
the
choice
of
a
devil
it
has
been
the
usual
method
of
mankind
to
single
out
some
being
,
either
in
act
or
in
vision
,
which
was
in
most
antipathy
to
the
god
they
had
framed
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
also
the
sect
of
the
AEolists
possessed
themselves
with
a
dread
and
horror
and
hatred
of
two
malignant
natures
,
betwixt
whom
and
the
deities
they
adored
perpetual
enmity
was
established
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
of
these
was
the
chameleon
,
sworn
foe
to
inspiration
,
who
in
scorn
devoured
large
influences
of
their
god
,
without
refunding
the
smallest
blast
by
eructation
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
was
a
huge
terrible
monster
called
Moulinavent
,
who
with
four
strong
arms
waged
eternal
battle
with
all
their
divinities
,
dexterously
turning
to
avoid
their
blows
and
repay
them
with
interest
.
   
<EOS>
Thus
furnished
,
and
set
out
with
gods
as
well
as
devils
,
was
the
renowned
sect
of
AEolists
,
which
makes
at
this
day
so
illustrious
a
figure
in
the
world
,
and
whereof
that
polite
nation
of
Laplanders
are
beyond
all
doubt
a
most
authentic
branch
,
of
whom
I
therefore
can
not
without
injustice
here
omit
to
make
honourable
mention
,
since
they
appear
to
be
so
closely
allied
in
point
of
interest
as
well
as
inclinations
with
their
brother
AEolists
among
us
,
as
not
only
to
buy
their
winds
by
wholesale
from
the
same
merchants
,
but
also
to
retail
them
after
the
same
rate
and
method
,
and
to
customers
much
alike
.
  
<EOS>
Now
whether
the
system
here
delivered
was
wholly
compiled
by
Jack
,
or
,
as
some
writers
believe
,
rather
copied
from
the
original
at
Delphos
,
with
certain
additions
and
emendations
suited
to
times
and
circumstances
,
I
shall
not
absolutely
determine
.
 
<EOS>
This
<EOS>
I
may
affirm
,
that
Jack
gave
it
at
least
a
new
turn
,
and
formed
it
into
the
same
dress
and
model
as
it
lies
deduced
by
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
long
sought
after
this
opportunity
of
doing
justice
to
a
society
of
men
for
whom
I
have
a
peculiar
honour
,
and
whose
opinions
as
well
as
practices
have
been
extremely
misrepresented
and
traduced
by
the
malice
or
ignorance
of
their
adversaries
.
 
<EOS>
For
I
think
it
one
of
the
greatest
and
best
of
human
actions
to
remove
prejudices
and
place
things
in
their
truest
and
fairest
light
,
which
I
therefore
boldly
undertake
,
without
any
regards
of
my
own
beside
the
conscience
,
the
honour
,
and
the
thanks
.

SECTION
IX
.
 
<EOS>
A
DIGRESSION
CONCERNING
THE
ORIGINAL
,
THE
USE
,
AND
IMPROVEMENT
OF
MADNESS
IN
A
COMMONWEALTH
.
  
<EOS>
Nor
shall
it
any
ways
detract
from
the
just
reputation
of
this
famous
sect
that
its
rise
and
institution
are
owing
to
such
an
author
as
I
have
described
Jack
to
be
,
a
person
whose
intellectuals
were
overturned
and
his
brain
shaken
out
of
its
natural
position
,
which
we
commonly
suppose
to
be
a
distemper
,
and
call
by
the
name
of
madness
or
frenzy
.
 
<EOS>
For
if
we
take
a
survey
of
the
greatest
actions
that
have
been
performed
in
the
world
under
the
influence
of
single
men
,
which
are
the
establishment
of
new
empires
by
conquest
,
the
advance
and
progress
of
new
schemes
in
philosophy
,
and
the
contriving
as
well
as
the
propagating
of
new
religions
,
we
shall
find
the
authors
of
them
all
to
have
been
persons
whose
natural
reason
hath
admitted
great
revolutions
from
their
diet
,
their
education
,
the
prevalency
of
some
certain
temper
,
together
with
the
particular
influence
of
air
and
climate
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
there
is
something
individual
in
human
minds
that
easily
kindles
at
the
accidental
approach
and
collision
of
certain
circumstances
,
which
,
though
of
paltry
and
mean
appearance
,
do
often
flame
out
into
the
greatest
emergencies
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
For
great
turns
are
not
always
given
by
strong
hands
,
but
by
lucky
adaptation
and
at
proper
seasons
,
and
it
is
of
no
import
where
the
fire
was
kindled
if
the
vapour
has
once
got
up
into
the
brain
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
upper
region
of
man
is
furnished
like
the
middle
region
of
the
air
,
the
materials
are
formed
from
causes
of
the
widest
difference
,
yet
produce
at
last
the
same
substance
and
effect
.
 
<EOS>
Mists
arise
from
the
earth
,
steams
from
dunghills
,
exhalations
from
the
sea
,
and
smoke
from
fire
;
yet
all
clouds
are
the
same
in
composition
as
well
as
consequences
,
and
the
fumes
issuing
from
a
jakes
will
furnish
as
comely
and
useful
a
vapour
as
incense
from
an
altar
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
far
,
I
suppose
,
will
easily
be
granted
me
;
and
then
it
will
follow
that
as
the
face
of
Nature
never
produces
rain
but
when
it
is
overcast
and
disturbed
,
so
human
understanding
seated
in
the
brain
must
be
troubled
and
overspread
by
vapours
ascending
from
the
lower
faculties
to
water
the
invention
and
render
it
fruitful
.
 
<EOS>
Now
although
these
vapours
(
as
it
hath
been
already
said
)
are
of
as
various
original
as
those
of
the
skies
,
yet
the
crop
they
produce
differs
both
in
kind
and
degree
,
merely
according
to
the
soil
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
produce
two
instances
to
prove
and
explain
what
I
am
now
advancing
.
  
<EOS>
A
certain
great
prince
 
raised
a
mighty
army
,
filled
his
coffers
with
infinite
treasures
,
provided
an
invincible
fleet
,
and
all
this
without
giving
the
least
part
of
his
design
to
his
greatest
ministers
or
his
nearest
favourites
.
 
<EOS>
Immediately
the
whole
world
was
alarmed
,
the
neighbouring
crowns
in
trembling
expectation
towards
what
point
the
storm
would
burst
,
the
small
politicians
everywhere
forming
profound
conjectures
.
 
<EOS>
Some
believed
he
had
laid
a
scheme
for
universal
monarchy
;
others
,
after
much
insight
,
determined
the
matter
to
be
a
project
for
pulling
down
the
Pope
and
setting
up
the
Reformed
religion
,
which
had
once
been
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
Some
again
,
of
a
deeper
sagacity
,
sent
him
into
Asia
to
subdue
the
Turk
and
recover
Palestine
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
all
these
projects
and
preparations
,
a
certain
state
-
surgeon
,
gathering
the
nature
of
the
disease
by
these
symptoms
,
attempted
the
cure
,
at
one
blow
performed
the
operation
,
broke
the
bag
and
out
flew
the
vapour
;
nor
did
anything
want
to
render
it
a
complete
remedy
,
only
that
the
prince
unfortunately
happened
to
die
in
the
performance
.
 
<EOS>
Now
is
the
reader
exceeding
curious
to
learn
from
whence
<EOS>
this
vapour
took
its
rise
,
which
had
so
long
set
the
nations
at
a
gaze
?
 
<EOS>
What
secret
wheel
,
what
hidden
spring
,
could
put
into
motion
so
wonderful
an
engine
?
 
<EOS>
It
was
afterwards
discovered
that
the
movement
of
this
whole
machine
had
been
directed
by
an
absent
female
,
who
was
removed
into
an
enemy
's
country
.
 
<EOS>
What
should
an
unhappy
prince
do
in
such
ticklish
circumstances
as
these
?
 
<EOS>
He
tried
in
vain
the
poet
's
never
-
failing
receipt
of
corpora
quaeque
,
for
  
<EOS>
"
Idque
petit
corpus
mens
unde
est
saucia
amore
;
Unde
feritur
,
eo
tendit
,
gestitque
coire
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Lucr
.
  
<EOS>
Having
to
no
purpose
used
all
peaceable
endeavours
,
the
collected
part
of
the
semen
,
raised
and
inflamed
,
became
adust
,
converted
to
choler
,
turned
head
upon
the
spinal
duct
,
and
ascended
to
the
brain
.
<EOS>
The
very
same
principle
that
influences
a
bully
to
break
the
windows
of
a
woman
who
has
jilted
him
naturally
stirs
up
a
great
prince
to
raise
mighty
armies
and
dream
of
nothing
but
sieges
,
battles
,
and
victories
.
  
<EOS>
The
other
instance
is
what
I
have
read
somewhere
in
a
very
ancient
author
of
a
mighty
king
,
who
,
for
the
space
of
above
thirty
years
,
amused
himself
to
take
and
lose
towns
,
beat
armies
and
be
beaten
,
drive
princes
out
of
their
dominions
,
fright
children
from
their
bread
and
butter
,
burn
,
lay
waste
,
plunder
,
dragoon
,
massacre
subject
and
stranger
,
friend
and
foe
,
male
and
female
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
recorded
that
the
philosophers
of
each
country
were
in
grave
dispute
upon
causes
natural
,
moral
,
and
political
,
to
find
out
where
they
should
assign
an
original
solution
of
this
phenomenon
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
the
vapour
or
spirit
which
animated
the
hero
's
brain
,
being
in
perpetual
circulation
,
seized
upon
that
region
of
the
human
body
so
renowned
for
furnishing
the
zibeta
occidentalis
,
and
gathering
there
into
a
tumour
,
left
the
rest
of
the
world
for
that
time
in
peace
.
<EOS>
Of
such
mighty
consequence
is
it
where
those
exhalations
fix
,
and
of
so
little
from
whence
they
proceed
.
 
<EOS>
The
same
spirits
which
in
their
superior
progress
would
conquer
a
kingdom
descending
upon
the
anus
,
conclude
in
a
fistula
.
  
<EOS>
Let
us
next
examine
the
great
introducers
of
new
schemes
in
philosophy
,
and
search
till
we
can
find
from
what
faculty
of
the
soul
the
disposition
arises
in
mortal
man
of
taking
it
into
his
head
to
advance
new
systems
with
such
an
eager
zeal
in
things
agreed
on
all
hands
impossible
to
be
known
;
from
what
seeds
this
disposition
springs
,
and
to
what
quality
of
human
nature
these
grand
innovators
have
been
indebted
for
their
number
of
disciples
,
because
it
is
plain
that
several
of
the
chief
among
them
,
both
ancient
and
modern
,
were
usually
mistaken
by
their
adversaries
,
and
,
indeed
,
by
all
,
except
their
own
followers
,
to
have
been
persons
crazed
or
out
of
their
wits
,
having
generally
proceeded
in
the
common
course
of
their
words
and
actions
by
a
method
very
different
from
the
vulgar
dictates
of
unrefined
reason
,
agreeing
for
the
most
part
in
their
several
models
with
their
present
undoubted
successors
in
the
academy
of
modern
Bedlam
,
whose
merits
and
principles
I
shall
further
examine
in
due
place
.
 
<EOS>
Of
this
kind
were
Epicurus
,
Diogenes
,
Apollonius
,
Lucretius
,
Paracelsus
,
Des
Cartes
,
and
others
,
who
,
if
they
were
now
in
the
world
,
tied
fast
and
separate
from
their
followers
,
would
in
this
our
undistinguishing
age
incur
manifest
danger
of
phlebotomy
,
and
whips
,
and
chains
,
and
dark
chambers
,
and
straw
.
 
<EOS>
For
what
man
in
the
natural
state
or
course
of
thinking
did
ever
conceive
it
in
his
power
to
reduce
the
notions
of
all
mankind
exactly
to
the
same
length
,
and
breadth
,
and
height
of
his
own
?
 
<EOS>
Yet
this
is
the
first
humble
and
civil
design
of
all
innovators
in
the
empire
of
reason
.
 
<EOS>
Epicurus
modestly
hoped
that
one
time
or
other
a
certain
fortuitous
concourse
of
all
men
's
opinions
,
after
perpetual
jostlings
,
the
sharp
with
the
smooth
,
the
light
and
the
heavy
,
the
round
and
the
square
,
would
,
by
certain
clinamina
,
unite
in
the
notions
of
atoms
and
void
,
as
these
did
in
the
originals
of
all
things
.
 
<EOS>
Cartesius
reckoned
to
see
before
he
died
the
sentiments
of
all
philosophers
,
like
so
many
lesser
stars
in
his
romantic
system
,
rapt
and
drawn
within
his
own
vortex
.
 
<EOS>
Now
I
would
gladly
be
informed
how
it
is
possible
to
account
for
such
imaginations
as
these
in
particular
men
,
without
recourse
to
my
phenomenon
of
vapours
ascending
from
the
lower
faculties
to
overshadow
the
brain
,
and
there
distilling
into
conceptions
,
for
which
the
narrowness
of
our
mother
-
tongue
has
not
yet
assigned
any
other
name
beside
that
of
madness
or
frenzy
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
therefore
now
conjecture
how
it
comes
to
pass
that
none
of
these
great
prescribers
do
ever
fail
providing
themselves
and
their
notions
with
a
number
of
implicit
disciples
,
and
I
think
the
reason
is
easy
to
be
assigned
,
for
there
is
a
peculiar
string
in
the
harmony
of
human
understanding
,
which
in
several
individuals
is
exactly
of
the
same
tuning
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
if
you
can
dexterously
screw
up
to
its
right
key
,
and
then
strike
gently
upon
it
whenever
you
have
the
good
fortune
to
light
among
those
of
the
same
pitch
,
they
will
by
a
secret
necessary
sympathy
strike
exactly
at
the
same
time
.
 
<EOS>
And
in
this
one
circumstance
lies
all
the
skill
or
luck
of
the
matter
;
for
,
if
you
chance
to
jar
the
string
among
those
who
are
either
above
or
below
your
own
height
,
instead
of
subscribing
to
your
doctrine
,
they
will
tie
you
fast
,
call
you
mad
,
and
feed
you
with
bread
and
water
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
therefore
a
point
of
the
nicest
conduct
to
distinguish
and
adapt
this
noble
talent
with
respect
to
the
differences
of
persons
and
of
times
.
 
<EOS>
Cicero
understood
this
very
well
,
when
,
writing
to
a
friend
in
England
,
with
a
caution
,
among
other
matters
,
to
beware
of
being
cheated
by
our
hackney
-
coachmen
(
who
,
it
seems
,
in
those
days
were
as
arrant
rascals
as
they
are
now
)
,
has
these
remarkable
words
,
Est

<EOS>
For
,
to
speak
a
bold
truth
,
it
is
a
fatal
miscarriage
so
ill
to
order
affairs
as
to
pass
for
a
fool
in
one
company
,
when
in
another
you
might
be
treated
as
a
philosopher
;
which
I
desire
some
certain
gentlemen
of
my
acquaintance
to
lay
up
in
their
hearts
as
a
very
seasonable
innuendo
.
  
<EOS>
This
,
indeed
,
was
the
fatal
mistake
of
that
worthy
gentleman
,
my
most
ingenious
friend
Mr.
Wotton
,
a
person
in
appearance
ordained
for
great
designs
as
well
as
performances
,
whether
you
will
consider
his
notions
or
his
looks
.
 
<EOS>
Surely
no
man
ever
advanced
into
the
public
with
fitter
qualifications
of
body
and
mind
for
the
propagation
of
a
new
religion
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
had
those
happy
talents
,
misapplied
to
vain
philosophy
,
been
turned
into
their
proper
channels
of
dreams
and
visions
,
where
distortion
of
mind
and
countenance
are
of
such
sovereign
use
,
<EOS>
the
base
,
detracting
world
would
not
then
have
dared
to
report
that
something
is
amiss
,
that
his
brain
hath
undergone
an
unlucky
shake
,
which
even
his
brother
modernists
themselves
,
like
ungrates
,
do
whisper
so
loud
that
it
reaches
up
to
the
very
garret
I
am
now
writing
in
.
  
<EOS>
Lastly
,
whoever
pleases
to
look
into
the
fountains
of
enthusiasm
,
from
whence
in
all
ages
have
eternally
proceeded
such
fattening
streams
,
will
find
the
spring
-
head
to
have
been
as
troubled
and
muddy
as
the
current
.
 
<EOS>
Of
such
great
emolument
is
a
tincture
of
this
vapour
,
which
the
world
calls
madness
,
that
without
its
help
the
world
would
not
only
be
deprived
of
those
two
great
blessings
,
conquests
and
systems
,
but
even
all
mankind
would
unhappily
be
reduced
to
the
same
belief
in
things
invisible
.
 
<EOS>
Now
the
former
postulatum
being
held
,
that
it
is
of
no
import
from
what
originals
this
vapour
proceeds
,
but
either
in
what
angles
it
strikes
and
spreads
over
the
understanding
,
or
upon
what
species
of
brain
it
ascends
,
it
will
be
a
very
delicate
point
to
cut
the
feather
and
divide
the
several
reasons
to
a
nice
and
curious
reader
,
how
this
numerical
difference
in
the
brain
can
produce
effects
of
so
vast
a
difference
from
the
same
vapour
as
to
be
the
sole
point
of
individuation
between
Alexander
the
Great
,
Jack
of
Leyden
,
and
Monsieur
Des
Cartes
.
 
<EOS>
The
present
argument
is
the
most
abstracted
that
ever
I
engaged
in
;
it
strains
my
faculties
to
their
highest
stretch
,
and
I
desire
the
reader
to
attend
with
utmost
perpensity
,
for
I
now
proceed
to
unravel
this
knotty
point
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
in
mankind
a
certain
.
.
.
<EOS>
Hic
multa
.
.
.
<EOS>
desiderantur
.
.
.
<EOS>
and
this
I
take
to
be
a
clear
solution
of
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
Having
,
therefore
,
so
narrowly
passed
through
this
intricate
difficulty
,
the
reader
will
,
I
am
sure
,
agree
with
me
in
the
conclusion
that
,
if
the
moderns
mean
by
madness
only
a
disturbance
or
transposition
of
the
brain
,
by
force
of
certain
vapours
issuing
up
from
the
lower
faculties
,
then
has
this
madness
been
the
parent
of
all
those
mighty
revolutions
that
have
happened
in
empire
,
in
philosophy
,
and
in
religion
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
brain
in
its
natural
position
and
state
of
serenity
disposeth
its
owner
to
pass
his
life
in
the
common
forms
,
without
any
thought
of
subduing
multitudes
to
his
own
power
,
his
reasons
,
or
his
visions
,
and
<EOS>
the
more
he
shapes
his
understanding
by
the
pattern
of
human
learning
,
the
less
he
is
inclined
to
form
parties
after
his
particular
notions
,
because
that
instructs
him
in
his
private
infirmities
,
as
well
as
in
the
stubborn
ignorance
of
the
people
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
a
man
's
fancy
gets
astride
on
his
reason
,
when
imagination
is
at
cuffs
with
the
senses
,
and
common
understanding
as
well
as
common
sense
is
kicked
out
of
doors
,
the
first
proselyte
he
makes
is
himself
;
and
when
that
is
once
compassed
,
the
difficulty
is
not
so
great
in
bringing
over
others
,
a
strong
delusion
always
operating
from
without
as
vigorously
as
from
within
.
 
<EOS>
For
ca
nt
and
<EOS>
vision
are
to
the
ear
and
the
eye
the
same
that
tickling
is
to
the
touch
.
 
<EOS>
Those
entertainments
and
pleasures
we
most
value
in
life
are
such
as
dupe
and
play
the
wag
with
the
senses
.
 
<EOS>
For
if
we
take
an
examination
of
what
is
generally
understood
by
happiness
,
as
it
has
respect
either
to
the
understanding
or
the
senses
we
shall
find
all
its
properties
and
adjuncts
will
herd
under
this
short
definition
,
that
it
is
a
perpetual
possession
of
being
well
deceived
.
 
<EOS>
And
first
,
with
relation
to
the
mind
or
understanding
,
it
is
manifest
what
mighty
advantages
fiction
has
over
truth
,
and
the
reason
is
just
at
our
elbow
:
 
because
imagination
can
build
nobler
scenes
and
produce
more
wonderful
revolutions
than
fortune
or
Nature
will
be
at
the
expense
to
furnish
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
is
mankind
so
much
to
blame
in
his
choice
thus
determining
him
,
if
we
consider
that
the
debate
merely
lies
between
things
past
and
things
conceived
,
and
so
the
question
is
only
this
:
<EOS>
whether
things
that
have
place
in
the
imagination
may
not
as
properly
be
said
to
exist
as
those
that
are
seated
in
the
memory
?
<EOS>
which
may
be
justly
held
in
the
affirmative
,
and
very
much
to
the
advantage
of
the
former
,
since
this
is
acknowledged
to
be
the
womb
of
things
,
and
the
other
allowed
to
be
no
more
than
the
grave
.
<EOS>
Again
,
if
we
take
this
definition
of
happiness
and
examine
it
with
reference
to
the
senses
,
it
will
be
acknowledged
wonderfully
adapt
.
<EOS>
How
sad
and
insipid
do
all
objects
accost
us
that
are
not
conveyed
in
the
vehicle
of
delusion
!
 
<EOS>
How
shrunk
is
everything
as
it
appears
in
the
glass
of
Nature
,
so
that
if
it
were
not
for
the
assistance
of
artificial
mediums
,
false
lights
,
refracted
angles
,
varnish
,
and
tinsel
,
there
would
be
a
mighty
level
in
the
felicity
and
enjoyments
of
mortal
men
.
 
<EOS>
If
this
were
seriously
considered
by
the
world
,
as
I
have
a
certain
reason
to
suspect
it
hardly
will
,
men
would
no
longer
reckon
among
their
high
points
of
wisdom
the
art
of
exposing
weak
sides
and
publishing
infirmities
 
<EOS>
an
employment
,
in
my
opinion
,
neither
better
nor
worse
than
that
of
unmasking
,
which
,
I
think
,
has
never
been
allowed
fair
usage
,
either
in
the
world
or
the
playhouse
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
proportion
that
credulity
is
a
more
peaceful
possession
of
the
mind
than
curiosity
,
so
far
preferable
is
that
wisdom
which
converses
about
the
surface
to
that
pretended
philosophy
which
enters
into
the
depths
of
things
and
then
comes
gravely
back
with
informations
and
discoveries
,
that
in
the
inside
they
are
good
for
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
senses
to
which
all
objects
first
address
themselves
are
the
sight
and
the
touch
;
these
never
examine
farther
than
the
colour
,
the
shape
,
the
size
,
and
whatever
other
qualities
dwell
or
are
drawn
by
art
upon
the
outward
of
bodies
;
and
then
comes
reason
officiously
,
with
tools
for
cutting
,
and
opening
,
and
mangling
,
and
piercing
,
offering
to
demonstrate
that
they
are
not
of
the
same
consistence
quite
through
.
 
<EOS>
Now
I
take
all
this
to
be
the
last
degree
of
perverting
Nature
,
one
of
whose
eternal
laws
it
is
to
put
her
best
furniture
forward
.
 
<EOS>
And
therefore
,
in
order
to
save
the
charges
of
all
such
expensive
anatomy
for
the
time
to
come
,
I
do
here
think
fit
to
inform
the
reader
that
in
such
conclusions
as
these
reason
is
certainly
in
the
right
;
and
that
in
most
corporeal
beings
which
have
fallen
under
my
cognisance
,
the
outside
hath
been
infinitely
preferable
to
the
in
<EOS>
,
whereof
I
have
been
further
convinced
from
some
late
experiments
.
 
<EOS>
Last
week
I
saw
a
woman
flayed
,
and
you
will
hardly
believe
how
much
it
altered
her
person
for
the
worse
.
 
<EOS>
Yesterday
I
ordered
the
carcass
of
a
beau
to
be
stripped
in
my
presence
,
when
we
were
all
amazed
to
find
so
many
unsuspected
faults
under
one
suit
of
clothes
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
laid
open
his
brain
,
his
heart
,
and
his
spleen
,
but
I
plainly
perceived
at
every
operation
that
the
farther
we
proceeded
,
we
found
the
defects
increase
upon
us
,
in
number
and
bulk
;
from
all
which
I
justly
formed
this
conclusion
to
myself
,
that
whatever
philosopher
or
projector
can
find
out
an
art
to
sodder
and
patch
up
the
flaws
and
imperfections
of
Nature
,
will
deserve
much
better
of
mankind
and
teach
us
a
more
useful
science
than
that
so
much
in
present
esteem
,
of
widening
and
exposing
them
(
like
him
who
held
anatomy
to
be
the
ultimate
end
of
physic
)
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
whose
fortunes
and
dispositions
have
placed
him
in
a
convenient
station
to
enjoy
the
fruits
of
this
noble
art
,
he
that
can
with
Epicurus
content
his
ideas
with
the
films
and
images
that
fly
off
upon
his
senses
from
the
superfices
of
things
,
such
a
man
,
<EOS>
truly
wise
,
creams
off
Nature
,
leaving
the
sour
and
the
dregs
for
philosophy
and
reason
to
lap
up
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
sublime
and
refined
point
of
felicity
called
the
possession
of
being
well
-
deceived
,
the
serene
peaceful
state
of
being
a
fool
among
knaves
.
  
<EOS>
But
to
return
to
madness
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
certain
that
,
according
to
the
system
I
have
above
deduced
,
every
species
thereof
proceeds
from
a
redundancy
of
vapour
;
therefore
,
as
some
kinds
of
frenzy
give
double
strength
to
the
sinews
,
so
there
are
of
other
species
which
add
vigour
,
and
life
,
and
spirit
to
the
brain
.
 
<EOS>
Now
it
usually
happens
that
these
active
spirits
,
getting
possession
of
the
brain
,
resemble
those
that
haunt
other
waste
and
empty
dwellings
,
which
for
want
of
business
either
vanish
and
carry
away
a
piece
of
the
house
,
or
else
stay
at
home
and
fling
it
all
out
of
the
windows
.
 
<EOS>
By
which
are
mystically
displayed
the
two
principal
branches
of
madness
,
and
which
some
philosophers
,
not
considering
so
well
as
I
,
have
mistook
to
be
different
in
their
causes
,
over
-
hastily
assigning
the
first
to
deficiency
and
the
other
to
redundance
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
it
therefore
manifest
,
from
what
I
have
here
advanced
,
that
the
main
point
of
skill
and
address
is
to
furnish
employment
for
this
redundancy
of
vapour
,
and
prudently
to
adjust
the
seasons
of
it
,
by
which
means
it
may
certainly
become
of
cardinal
and
catholic
emolument
in
a
commonwealth
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
one
man
,
choosing
a
proper
juncture
,
leaps
into
a
gulf
,
from
thence
proceeds
a
hero
,
and
is
called
the
saviour
of
his
country
.
 
<EOS>
Another
achieves
the
same
enterprise
,
but
unluckily
timing
it
,
has
left
the
brand
of
madness
fixed
as
a
reproach
upon
his
memory
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
so
nice
<EOS>
a
distinction
are
we
taught
to
repeat
the
name
of
Curtius
with
reverence
and
love
,
that
of
Empedocles
with
hatred
and
contempt
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
also
it
is
usually
conceived
that
the
elder
Brutus
only
personated
the
fool
and
madman
for
the
good
of
the
public
;
but
this
was
nothing
else
than
a
redundancy
of
the
same
vapour
long
misapplied
,
called
by
the
Latins
ingenium
par
negotiis
,
or
(
to
translate
it
as
nearly
as
I
can
)
,
a
sort
of
frenzy
never
in
its
right
element
till
you
take
it
up
in
business
of
the
state
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
all
which
,
and
many
other
reasons
of
equal
weight
,
though
not
equally
curious
,
I
do
here
gladly
embrace
an
opportunity
I
have
long
sought
for
,
of
recommending
it
as
a
very
noble
undertaking
to
Sir
Edward
Seymour
,
Sir
Christopher
Musgrave
,
Sir
John
Bowles
,
John
Howe
,
Esq

,
and
other
patriots
concerned

that
they
would
move
for
leave
to
bring
in
a
Bill
for
appointing
commissioners
to
inspect
into
Bedlam
and
the
parts
adjacent

who
shall
be

send

papers

the
merits
and
qualifications
of
every
student

professor

to
observe
with
utmost
exactness
their
several
dispositions
and
behaviour
,
by
which
means
,
duly
distinguishing
and
adapting
their
talents
,
they
might
produce
admirable
instruments
for
the
several
offices
in
a
state

<EOS>
civil
and
military
,
proceeding
in
such
methods
as
I
shall
here
humbly
propose
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
hope
the
gentle
reader
will
give
some
allowance
to
my
great
solicitudes
in
this
important
affair
,
upon
account
of
that
high
esteem
I
have
ever
borne
that
honourable
society

whereof
I
had
some
time
the
happiness
to
be
an
unworthy

<EOS>
Is
any

tearing
his
straw
in
piecemeal

swearing
and
blaspheming

biting
his
grate

foaming

and
emptying
his

faces

Let

!
 
<EOS>
Let
him
be
furnished
immediately
with
a
green
bag
and
papers
,
and
threepence
in
his
pocket
,
and
away
with
him
to
Westminster
Hall
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
find
a
third
gravely
taking
the
dimensions
of
his
kennel
,
a
person
of
foresight
and
insight
,
though
kept
quite
in
the
dark
;
for
why
,
like
Moses
,
Ecce
cornuta
erat
ejus
facies
.
 
<EOS>
He
walks
duly
in
one
pace
,
entreats
your
penny
with
due
gravity
and
ceremony
,
talks
much
of
hard
times
,
and
taxes
,
and
the
whore
of
Babylon
,
bars
up
the
wooden
of
his
cell
constantly
at
eight
o'clock
,
dreams
of
fire
,
and
shoplifters
,
and
court
-
customers
,
and
privileged
places
.
 
<EOS>
Now
what
a
figure
would
all
these
acquirements
amount
to
if
the
owner
were
sent
into
the
City
among
his
brethren
!
 
<EOS>
Behold
a
fourth
in
much
and
deep
conversation
with
himself
,
biting
his
thumbs
at
proper
junctures
<EOS>
,
his
countenance
chequered
with
business
and
design
;
sometimes
walking
very
fast
,
with
his
eyes
nailed
to
a
paper
that
he
holds
in
his
hands
;
a
great
saver
of
time
,
somewhat
thick
of
hearing
,
very
short
of
sight
,
but
more
of
memory
;
a
man
ever
in
haste
,
a
great
hatcher
and
breeder
of
business
,
and
excellent
at
the
famous
art
of
whispering
nothing
;
a
huge
idolator
of
monosyllables
and
procrastination
,
so
ready
to
give
his
word
to
everybody
that
he
never
keeps
it
;
one
that
has
forgot
the
common
meaning
of
words
,
but
an
admirable
retainer
of
the
sound
;
extremely
subject
to
the
looseness
,
for
his
occasions
are
perpetually
calling
him
away
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
approach
his
grate
in
his
familiar
intervals
,
"
Sir
,
"
says
he
,
"
give
me
a
penny
<EOS>
and
I
'll
sing
you
a
song
;
but
give
me
the
penny
first
"
<EOS>
(
hence
comes
the
common
saying
and
commoner
practice
of
parting
with
money
for
a
song
)
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
complete
system
of
court
-
skill
is
here
described
in
every
branch
of
it
,
and
all
utterly
lost
with
wrong
application
!
 
<EOS>
Accost
the
hole
of
another
kennel
,
first
stopping
your
nose
,
you
will
behold
a
surly
,
gloomy
,
nasty
,
slovenly
mortal
,
raking
in
his
own
dung
and
dabbling
in
his
urine
.
 
<EOS>
The
best
part
of
his
diet
is
the
reversion
of
his
own
ordure
,
which
expiring
into
steams
,
whirls
perpetually
about
,
and
at
last
reinfunds
.
 
<EOS>
His
complexion
is
of
a
dirty
yellow
,
with
a
thin
scattered
beard
,
exactly
agreeable
to
that
of
his
diet
upon
its
first
declination
,
like
other
insects
,
who
,
having
their
birth
and
education
in
an
excrement
,
from
thence
borrow
their
colour
and
their
smell
.
 
<EOS>
The
student
of
this
apartment
is
very
sparing
of
his
words
,
but
somewhat
over
-
liberal
of
his
breath
.
 
<EOS>
He
holds
his
hand
out
ready
to
receive
your
penny
,
and
immediately
upon
receipt
withdraws
to
his
former
occupations
.
 
<EOS>
Now
is
it
not
amazing
to
think
the
society
of
Warwick
Lane
 
should
have
no
more
concern
for
the
recovery
of
so
useful
<EOS>
a
member
,
who
,
if
one
may
judge
from
these
appearances
,
would
become
the
greatest
ornament
to
that
illustrious
body
?
 
<EOS>
Another
student
struts
up
fiercely
to
your
teeth
,
puffing
with
his
lips
,
half
squeezing
out
his
eyes
,
and
very
graciously
holds
out
his
hand
to
kiss
.
 
<EOS>
The
keeper
desires
you
not
to
be
afraid
of
this
professor
,
for
he
will
do
you
no
hurt
;
to
him
alone
is
allowed
the
liberty
of
the
ante
-
chamber
,
and
the
orator
of
the
place
gives
you
to
understand
that
this
solemn
person
is
a
tailor
run
mad
with
pride
.
<EOS>
This
considerable
student
is
adorned
with
many
other
qualities
,
upon
which
at
present
I
shall
not
further
enlarge
.
.
.
.
<EOS>
Hark
in
your
ear
.
.
.
<EOS>
.
<EOS>
I
am
strangely
mistaken
if
all
his
address
,
his
motions
,
and
his
airs
would
not
then
be
very
natural
and
in
their
proper
element
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
not
descend
so
minutely
as
to
insist
upon
the
vast
number
of
beaux
,
fiddlers
,
poets
,
and
politicians
that
the
world
might
recover
by
such
a
reformation
,
but
what
is
more
material
,
beside
the
clear
gain
redounding
to
the
commonwealth
by
so
large
an
acquisition
of
persons
to
employ
,
whose
talents
and
acquirements
,
if
I
may
be
so
bold
to
affirm
it
,
are
now
buried
or
at
least
misapplied
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
mighty
advantage
accruing
to
the
public
from
this
inquiry
that
all
these
would
very
much
excel
and
arrive
at
great
perfection
in
their
several
kinds
,
which
I
think
is
manifest
from
what
I
have
already
shown
,
and
shall
enforce
by
this
one
plain
instance
,
that
even
I
myself
,
the
author
of
these
momentous
truths
,
am
a
person
whose
imaginations
are
hard
-
mouthed
and
exceedingly
disposed
to
run
away
with
his
reason
,
which
I
have
observed
from
long
experience
to
be
a
very
light
rider
,
and
easily
shook
off
;
upon
which
account
my
friends
will
never
trust
me
alone
without
a
solemn
promise
to
vent
my
speculations
in
this
or
the
like
manner
,
for
the
universal
benefit
of
human
kind
,
which
perhaps
the
gentle
,
courteous
,
and
candid
reader
,
brimful
of
that
modern
charity
and
tenderness
usually
annexed
to
his
office
,
will
be
very
hardly
persuaded
to
believe
.

SECTION
X.
 
A
FARTHER
DIGRESSION
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
an
unanswerable
argument
of
a
very
refined
age
the
wonderful
civilities
that
have
passed
of
late
years
between
the
nation
of
authors
and
that
of
readers
.
 
<EOS>
There
can
hardly
pop
out
a
play
,
a
pamphlet
,
or
a
poem
without
a
preface
full
of
acknowledgments
to
the
world
for
the
general
reception
and
applause
they
have
given
it
,
which
the
Lord
knows
where
,
or
when
,
or
how
,
or
from
whom
it
received
.
 
<EOS>
In
due
deference
to
so
laudable
a
custom
,
I
do
here
return
my
humble
thanks
to
His
Majesty
and
both
Houses
of
Parliament
,
to
the
Lords
of
the
King
's
most
honourable
Privy
Council
,
to
the
reverend
the
Judges
,
to
the
Clergy
,
and
Gentry
,
and
Yeomanry
of
this
land
;
but
in
a
more
especial
manner
to
my
worthy
brethren
and
friends
at
Will
's
Coffee
-
house
,
and
Gresham
College
,
and
Warwick
Lane
,
and
Moorfields
,
and
Scotland
Yard
,
and
Westminster
Hall
,
and
Guildhall
;
in
short
,
to
all
inhabitants
and
retainers
whatsoever
,
either
in
court
,
or
church
,
or
camp
,
or
city
,
or
country
,
for
their
generosity
and
universal
acceptance
of
this
divine
treatise
.
 
<EOS>
I
accept
their
approbation
and
good
opinion
with
extreme
gratitude
,
and
to
the
utmost
of
my
poor
capacity
shall
take
hold
of
all
opportunities
to
return
the
obligation
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
also
happy
that
fate
has
flung
me
into
<EOS>
so
blessed
an
age
for
the
mutual
felicity
of
booksellers
and
authors
,
whom
I
may
safely
affirm
to
be
at
this
day
the
two
only
satisfied
parties
in
England
.
<EOS>
Ask
an
author
how
his
last
piece
has
succeeded
,
"
Why
,
truly
he
thanks
his
stars
the
world
has
been
very
favourable
,
and
he
has
not
the
least
reason
to
complain
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
yet
he
wrote
it
in
a
week
at
bits
and
starts
,
when
he
could
steal
an
hour
from
his
urgent
affairs
,
as
it
is
a
hundred
to
one
you
may
see
further
in
the
preface
,
to
which
he
refers
you
,
and
for
the
rest
to
the
bookseller
.
<EOS>
There
you
go
as
a
customer
,
and
make
the
same
question
,
"
He
blesses
his
God
<EOS>
the
thing
takes
wonderful
;
he
is
just
printing
a
second
edition
,
and
has
but
three
left
in
his
shop
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
beat
down
the
price
;
sir
,
we
shall
not
differ
,
"
and
in
hopes
of
your
custom
another
time
,
lets
you
have
it
as
reasonable
as
you
please
;
"
<EOS>
And
pray
send
as
many
of
your
acquaintance
as
you
will
<EOS>
;
I
shall
upon
your
account
furnish
them
all
at
the
same
rate
.
"
  
<EOS>
Now
it
is
not
well
enough
considered
to
what
accidents
and
occasions
<EOS>
the
world
is
indebted
for
the
greatest
part
of
those
noble
writings
which
hourly
start
up
to
entertain
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
were
not
for
a
rainy
day
,
a
drunken
vigil
,
a
fit
of
the
spleen
,
a
course
of
physic
,
a
sleepy
Sunday
,
an
ill
run
at
dice
,
a
long
tailor
's
bill
,
a
beggar
's
purse
,
a
factious
head
,
a
hot
sun
,
costive
diet
,
want
of
books
,
and
a
just
contempt
of
learning
,
 
but
for
these
events
,
I
say
,
and
some
others
too
long
to
recite
(
especially
a
prudent
neglect
of
taking
brimstone
inwardly
)
<EOS>
,
I
doubt
the
number
of
authors
and
of
writings
would
dwindle
away
to
a
degree
most
woeful
to
behold
.
 
<EOS>
To
confirm
this
opinion
,
hear
the
words
of
the
famous
troglodyte
philosopher
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
certain
,
"
said
he
,
"
some
grains
of
folly
are
of
course
annexed
as
part
in
the
composition
of
human
nature
;
only
the
choice
is
left
us
whether
we
please
to
wear
them
inlaid
or
embossed
,
and
we
need
not
go
very
far
to
seek
how
that
is
usually
determined
,
when
we
remember
it
is
with
human
faculties
as
with
liquors
,
the
lightest
will
be
ever
at
the
top
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
is
in
this
famous
island
of
Britain
a
certain
paltry
scribbler
,
very
voluminous
,
whose
character
the
reader
can
not
wholly
be
a
stranger
to
.
 
<EOS>
He
deals
in
a
pernicious
kind
of
writings
called
"
Second
Parts
,
"
and
usually
passes
under
the
name
of
"
The
Author
of
the
First
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
easily
foresee
that
as
soon
as
I
lay
down
my
pen
this
nimble
operator
will
have
stole
it
,
and
treat
me
as
inhumanly
as
he
has
already
done
Dr.
 
Blackmore
,
Lestrange
,
and
many
others
who
shall
here
be
nameless
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
fly
for
justice
and
relief
into
the
hands
of
that
great
rectifier
of
saddles
and
lover
of
mankind
,
Dr.
Bentley
,
begging
he
will
take
this
enormous
grievance
into
his
most
modern
consideration
;
and
if
it
should
so
happen
that
the
furniture
of
an
ass
in
the
shape
of
a
second
part
must
for
my
sins
be
clapped
,
by
mistake
,
upon
my
back
,
that
he
will
immediately
please
,
in
the
presence
of
the
world
,
to
lighten
me
of
the
burthen
,
and
take
it
home
to
his
own
house
till
the
true
beast
thinks
fit
to
call
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
I
do
here
give
this
public
notice
that
my
resolutions
are
to
circumscribe
within
this
discourse
the
whole
stock
of
matter
I
have
been
so
many
years
providing
.
 
<EOS>
Since
my
vein
is
once
opened
,
I
am
content
to
exhaust
it
all
at
a
running
,
for
the
peculiar
advantage
of
my
dear
country
,
and
for
the
universal
benefit
of
mankind
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
hospitably
considering
the
number
of
my
guests
,
they
shall
have
my
whole
entertainment
at
a
meal
,
and
I
scorn
to
set
up
the
leavings
in
the
cupboard
.
 
<EOS>
What
the
guests
can
not
eat
may
be
given
to
the
poor
,
and
the
dogs
under
the
table
may
gnaw
the
bones
.
 
<EOS>
This
<EOS>
I
understand
for
a
more
generous
proceeding
than
to
turn
the
company
's
stomachs
by
inviting
them
again
to
-
morrow
to
a
scurvy
meal
of
scraps
.
  
<EOS>
If
the
reader
fairly
considers
the
strength
of
what
I
have
advanced
in
the
foregoing
section
,
I
am
convinced
it
will
produce
a
wonderful
revolution
in
his
notions
and
opinions
,
and
he
will
be
abundantly
better
prepared
to
receive
and
to
relish
the
concluding
part
of
this
miraculous
treatise
.
 
<EOS>
Readers
may
be
divided
into
three
classes
 
the
superficial
,
the
ignorant
,
and
the
learned
,
and
I
have
with
much
felicity
fitted
my
pen
to
the
genius
and
advantage
of
each
.
 
<EOS>
The
superficial
reader
will
be
strangely
provoked
to
laughter
,
which
clears
the
breast
and
the
lungs
,
is
sovereign
against
the
spleen
,
and
the
most
innocent
of
all
diuretics
.
 
<EOS>
The
ignorant
reader
(
between
whom
and
<EOS>
the
former
the
distinction
is
extremely
nice
)
will
find
himself
disposed
to
stare
,
which
is
an
admirable
remedy
for
ill
eyes
,
serves
to
raise
and
enliven
the
spirits
,
and
wonderfully
helps
perspiration
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
reader
truly
learned
,
chiefly
for
whose
benefit
I
wake
when
others
sleep
,
and
sleep
<EOS>
when
others
wake
,
will
here
find
sufficient
matter
to
employ
his
speculations
for
the
rest
of
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
It
were
much
to
be
wished
,
and
I
do
here
humbly
propose
for
an
experiment
,
that
every
prince
in
Christendom
will
take
seven
of
the
deepest
scholars
in
his
dominions
and
shut
them
up
close
for
seven
years
in
seven
chambers
,
with
a
command
to
write
seven
ample
commentaries
on
this
comprehensive
discourse
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
venture
to
affirm
<EOS>
that
,
whatever
difference
may
be
found
in
their
several
conjectures
,
they
will
be
all
,
without
the
least
distortion
,
manifestly
deducible
from
the
text
.
 
<EOS>
Meantime
it
is
my
earnest
request
that
so
useful
an
undertaking
may
be
entered
upon
(
if
their
Majesties
please
)
with
all
convenient
speed
,
because
I
have
a
strong
inclination
before
I
leave
the
world
to
taste
a
blessing
which
we
mysterious
writers
can
seldom
reach
till
we
have
got
into
our
graves
,
whether
it
is
that
fame
being
a
fruit
grafted
on
the
body
,
can
hardly
grow
and
much
less
ripen
till
the
stock
is
in
the
earth
,
or
whether
she
be
a
bird
of
prey
,
and
is
lured
among
the
rest
to
pursue
after
the
scent
of
a
carcass
,
or
whether
she
conceives
her
trumpet
sounds
best
and
farthest
when
she
stands
on
a
tomb
,
by
the
advantage
of
a
rising
ground
and
the
echo
of
a
hollow
vault
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
true
,
indeed
,
the
republic
of
dark
authors
,
after
they
once
found
out
this
excellent
expedient
of
dying
,
have
been
peculiarly
happy
in
the
variety
as
well
as
extent
of
their
reputation
.
 
<EOS>
For
night
being
the
universal
mother
of
things
,
wise
philosophers
hold
all
writings
to
be
fruitful
in
the
proportion
they
are
dark
,
and
therefore
the
true
illuminated
(
that
is
to
say
,
the
darkest
of
all
)
have
met
with
such
numberless
commentators
,
whose
scholiastic
midwifery
hath
delivered
them
of
meanings
that
the
authors
themselves
perhaps
never
conceived
,
and
yet
may
very
justly
be
allowed
the
lawful
parents
of
them
,
the
words
of
such
writers
being
like
seed
,
which
,
however
scattered
at
random
,
when
they
light
upon
a
fruitful
ground
,
will
multiply
far
beyond
either
the
hopes
or
imagination
of
the
sower
.
  
<EOS>
And
therefore
,
in
order
to
promote
so
useful
a
work
,
I
will
here
take
leave
to
glance
a
few
innuendos
that
may
be
of
great
assistance
to
those
sublime
spirits
who
shall
be
appointed
to
labour
in
a
universal
comment
upon
this
wonderful
discourse
.
 
<EOS>
And
first
,
I
have
couched
a
very
profound
mystery
in
the
number
of
0
's
multiplied
by
seven
and
divided
by
nine
.
 
<EOS>
Also
,
if
a
devout
brother
of
the
Rosy
Cross
will
pray
fervently
for
sixty
-
three
mornings
with
a
lively
faith
,
and
then
transpose
certain
letters
and
syllables
according
to
prescription
,
in
the
second
and
fifth
section
they
will
certainly
reveal
into
a
full
receipt
of
the
opus
magnum
.
 
<EOS>
Lastly
,
whoever
will
be
at
the
pains
to
calculate
the
whole
number
of
each
letter
in
this
treatise
,
and
sum
up
the
difference
exactly
between
the
several
numbers
,
assigning
the
true
natural
cause
for
every
such
difference
,
the
discoveries
in
the
product
will
plentifully
reward
his
labour
.
<EOS>
But
then
he
must
beware
of
Bythus
and
Sige
,
and
be
sure
not
to
forget
the
qualities
of
Acamoth
;
a
cujus
lacrymis
humecta
prodit
substantia
,
a
risu
lucida
,
a
tristitia
solida
,
et
a
timore
mobilis
,
wherein
Eugenius
Philalethes
 
hath
committed
an
unpardonable
mistake
.

SECTION

<EOS>
A
TALE
OF
A
TUB
.
  
<EOS>
After
so
wide
a
compass
as
I
have
wandered
,
I
do
now
gladly
overtake
and
close
in
with
my
subject
,
and
shall
henceforth
hold
on
with
it
<EOS>
an
even
pace
to
the
end
of
my
journey
,
except
some
beautiful
prospect
appears
within
sight
of
my
way
,
whereof
,
though
at
present
I
have
neither
warning
nor
expectation
,
yet
upon
such
an
accident
,
come
when
it
will
,
I
shall
beg
my
reader
's
favour
and
company
,
allowing
me
to
conduct
him
through
it
along
with
myself
.
 
<EOS>
For
in
writing
it
is
as
in
travelling
.
 
<EOS>
If
a
man
is
in
haste
to
be
at
home
(
<EOS>
which
I
acknowledge
to
be
none
of
my
case
,
having
never
so
little
business
as
when
I
am
there
)
,
if
his
horse
be
tired
with
long
riding
and
ill
ways
,
or
be
naturally
a
jade
,
I
advise
him
clearly
to
make
the
straightest
and
the
commonest
road
,
be
it
ever
so
dirty
;
but
then
surely
we
must
own
such
a
man
to
be
a
scurvy
companion
at
best
.
<EOS>
He
spatters
himself
and
his
fellow
-
travellers
at
every
step
.
 
<EOS>
All
their
thoughts
,
and
wishes
,
and
conversation
turn
entirely
upon
the
subject
of
their
journey
's
end
,
and
at
every
splash
,
and
plunge
,
and
stumble
they
heartily
wish
one
another
at
the
devil
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
other
side
,
when
a
traveller
and
his
horse
are
in
heart
and
plight
,
when
his
purse
is
full
and
the
day
before
him
,
he
takes
the
road
only
where
it
is
clean
or
convenient
,
entertains
his
company
there
as
agreeably
as
he
can
,
but
upon
the
first
occasion
carries
them
along
with
him
to
every
delightful
scene
in
view
,
whether
of
art
,
of
Nature
,
or
of
both
;
and
if
they
chance
to
refuse
out
of
stupidity
or
weariness
,
let
them
jog
on
by
themselves
,
and
be
d
 
n'd
.
<EOS>
He
'll
overtake
them
at
the
next
town
,
at
which
arriving
,
he
rides
furiously
through
,
the
men
,
women
,
and
children
run
out
to
gaze
,
a
hundred
noisy
curs
run
barking
after
him
,
of
which
,
if
he
honours
the
boldest
with
a
lash
of
his
whip
,
it
is
rather
out
of
sport
than
revenge
.
 
<EOS>
But
should
some
sourer
mongrel
dare
too
near
an
approach
,
he
receives
a
salute
on
the
chaps
by
an
accidental
stroke
from
the
courser
's
heels
,
nor
is
any
ground
lost
by
the
blow
,
which
sends
him
yelping
and
limping
home
.
  
<EOS>
I
now
proceed
to
sum
up
the
singular
adventures
of
my
renowned
Jack
,
the
state
of
whose
dispositions
and
fortunes
the
careful
reader
does
,
no
doubt
,
most
exactly
remember
,
as
I
last
parted
with
them
in
the
conclusion
of
a
former
section
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
his
next
care
must
be
from
two
of
the
foregoing
to
extract
a
scheme
of
notions
that
may
best
fit
his
understanding
for
a
true
relish
of
what
is
to
ensue
.
  
<EOS>
Jack
had
not
only
calculated
the
first
revolution
of
his
brain
so
prudently
as
to
give
rise
to
that
epidemic
sect
of
AEolists
,
but
succeeding
also
into
a
new
and
strange
variety
of
conceptions
,
the
fruitfulness
of
his
imagination
led
him
into
certain
notions
which
,
although
in
appearance
very
unaccountable
,
were
not
without
their
mysteries
and
their
meanings
,
nor
wanted
followers
to
countenance
and
improve
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
therefore
be
extremely
careful
and
exact
in
recounting
such
material
passages
of
this
nature
as
I
have
been
able
to
collect
either
from
undoubted
tradition
or
indefatigable
reading
,
and
shall
describe
them
as
graphically
as
it
is
possible
,
and
as
far
as
notions
of
that
height
and
latitude
can
be
brought
within
the
compass
of
a
pen
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
do
I
at
all
question
but
they
will
furnish
plenty
of
noble
matter
for
such
whose
converting
imaginations
dispose
them
to
reduce
all
things
into
types
,
who
can
make
shadows
 
no
thanks
to
the
sun
 
<EOS>
and
then
mould
them
into
substances
 
<EOS>
no
thanks
to
philosophy
 
whose
peculiar
talent
lies
in
fixing
tropes
and
allegories
to
the
letter
,
and
refining
what
is
literal
into
figure
and
mystery
.
  
<EOS>
Jack
had
provided
a
fair
copy
of
his
father
's
will
,
engrossed
in
form
upon
a
large
skin
of
parchment
,
and
resolving
to
act
the
part
of
a
most
dutiful
son
<EOS>
,
he
became
the
fondest
creature
of
it
imaginable
.
 
<EOS>
For
although
,
as
I
have
often
told
the
reader
,
it
consisted
wholly
in
certain
plain
,
easy
directions
about
the
management
and
wearing
of
their
coats
,
with
legacies
and
penalties
in
case
of
obedience
or
neglect
,
yet
he
began
to
entertain
a
fancy
that
the
matter
was
deeper
and
darker
,
and
therefore
must
needs
have
a
great
deal
more
of
mystery
at
the
bottom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
will
prove
this
very
skin
of
parchment
to
be
meat
,
drink
,
and
cloth
,
to
be
the
philosopher
's
stone
and
the
universal
medicine
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
which
raptures
he
resolved
to
make
use
of
it
in
the
most
necessary
as
well
as
the
most
paltry
occasions
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
way
of
working
it
into
any
shape
he
pleased
,
so
that
it
served
him
for
a
nightcap
when
he
went
to
bed
,
and
for
an
umbrella
in
rainy
weather
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
lap
a
piece
of
it
about
a
sore
toe
;
or
,
when
he
had
fits
,
burn
two
inches
under
his
nose
;
or
,
if
anything
lay
heavy
on
his
stomach
,
scrape
off
and
swallow
as
much
of
the
powder
as
would
lie
on
a
silver
penny
 
they
were
all
infallible
remedies
.
<EOS>
With
analogy
to
these
refinements
,
his
common
talk
and
conversation
ran
wholly
in
the
praise
of
his
Will
,
and
he
circumscribed
the
utmost
of
his
eloquence
within
that
compass
,
not
daring
to
let
slip
a
syllable
without
authority
from
thence
.
 
<EOS>
Once
at
a
strange
house
he
was
suddenly
taken
short
upon
an
urgent
juncture
,
whereon
it
may
not
be
allowed
too
particularly
to
dilate
,
and
being
not
able
to
call
to
mind
,
with
that
suddenness
the
occasion
required
,
an
authentic
phrase
for
demanding
the
way
to
the
back
,
he
chose
rather
,
as
the
more
prudent
course
,
to
incur
the
penalty
in
such
cases
usually
annexed
;
neither
was
it
possible
for
the
united
rhetoric
of
mankind
to
prevail
with
him
to
make
himself
clean
again
,
because
,
having
consulted
the
will
upon
this
emergency
,
he
met
with
a
passage
near
the
bottom
(
whether
foisted
in
by
the
transcriber
is
not
known
)
which
seemed
to
forbid
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
made
it
a
part
of
his
religion
never
to
say
grace
to
his
meat
,
nor
could
all
the
world
persuade
him
,
as
the
common
phrase
is
,
to
eat
his
victuals
like
a
Christian
.
  
<EOS>
He
bore
a
strange
kind
of
appetite
to
snap
-
dragon
and
to
the
livid
snuffs
of
a
burning
candle
,
which
he
would
catch
and
swallow
with
an
agility
wonderful
to
conceive
;
and
by
this
procedure
maintained
a
perpetual
flame
in
his
belly
,
which
issuing
in
a
glowing
steam
from
both
his
eyes
,
as
well
as
his
nostrils
and
his
mouth
,
made
his
head
appear
in
a
dark
night
like
the
skull
of
an
ass
wherein
a
roguish
boy
hath
conveyed
a
farthing
-
candle
,
to
the
terror
of
his
Majesty
's
liege
subjects
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
he
made
use
of
no
other
expedient
to
light
himself
home
,
but
was
wo
nt
to
say
that
a
wise
man
was
his
own
lanthorn
.
  
<EOS>
He
would
shut
his
eyes
as
he
walked
along
the
streets
,
and
if
he
happened
to
bounce
his
head
against
a
post
or
fall
into
the
kennel
(
as
he
seldom
missed
either
to
do
one
or
both
)
,
he
would
tell
the
gibing
apprentices
who
looked
on
that
he
submitted
with
entire
resignation
,
as
to
a
trip
or
a
blow
of
fate
,
with
whom
he
found
by
long
experience
how
vain
it
was
either
to
wrestle
or
to
cuff
,
and
whoever
durst
undertake
to
do
either
would
be
sure
to
come
off
with
a
swingeing
fall
or
a
bloody
nose
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
ordained
,
"
said
he
,
"
some
few
days
before
the
creation
,
that
my
nose
and
this
very
post
should
have
a
rencounter
,
and
therefore
Providence
thought
fit
to
send
us
both
into
the
world
in
the
same
age
,
and
to
make
us
countrymen
and
fellow
-
citizens
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
had
my
eyes
been
open
,
it
is
very
likely
the
business
might
have
been
a
great
deal
worse
,
for
how
many
a
confounded
slip
is
daily
got
by
man
with
all
his
foresight
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
the
eyes
of
the
understanding
see
best
when
those
of
the
senses
are
out
of
the
way
,
and
therefore
blind
men
are
observed
to
tread
their
steps
with
much
more
caution
,
and
conduct
,
and
judgment
than
those
who
rely
with
too
much
confidence
upon
the
virtue
of
the
visual
nerve
,
which
every
little
accident
shakes
out
of
order
,
and
a
drop
or
a
film
can
wholly
disconcert
;
like
a
lanthorn
among
a
pack
of
roaring
bullies
when
they
scour
the
streets
,
exposing
its
owner
and
itself
to
outward
kicks
and
buffets
,
which
both
might
have
escaped
if
the
vanity
of
appearing
would
have
suffered
them
to
walk
in
the
dark
.
 
<EOS>
But
further
,
if
we
examine
the
conduct
of
these
boasted
lights
,
it
will
prove
yet
a
great
deal
worse
than
their
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
true
I
have
broke
my
nose
against
this
post
,
because
Providence
either
forgot
,
or
did
not
think
it
convenient
,
to
twitch
me
by
the
elbow
and
give
me
notice
to
avoid
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
let
not
this
encourage
either
the
present
age
of
posterity
to
trust
their
noses
unto
the
keeping
of
their
eyes
,
which
may
prove
the
fairest
way
of
losing
them
for
good
and
all
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
O
ye
eyes
,
ye
blind
guides
,
miserable
guardians
are
ye
of
our
frail
noses
;
ye
,
I
say
,
who
fasten
upon
the
first
precipice
in
view
,
and
then
tow
our
wretched
willing
bodies
after
you
to
the
very
brink
of
destruction
.
<EOS>
But
alas
!
<EOS>
that
brink
is
rotten
,
our
feet
slip
,
and
we
tumble
down
prone
into
a
gulf
,
without
one
hospitable
shrub
in
the
way
to
break
the
fall
 
a
fall
to
which
not
any
nose
of
mortal
make
is
equal
,
except
that
of
the
giant
Laurcalco
,
who
was
Lord
of
the
Silver
Bridge
.
 
<EOS>
Most
properly
,
therefore
,
O
eyes
,
and
with
great
justice
,
may
you
be
compared
to
those
foolish
lights
which
conduct
men
through
dirt
and
darkness
till
they
fall
into
a
deep
pit
or
a
noisome
bog
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
I
have
produced
as
a
scantling
of
Jack
's
great
eloquence
and
the
force
of
his
reasoning
upon
such
abstruse
matters
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
,
besides
,
a
person
of
great
design
and
improvement
in
affairs
of
devotion
,
having
introduced
a
new
deity
,
who
has
since
met
with
a
vast
number
of
worshippers
,
by
some
called
Babel
,
by
others
Chaos
,
who
had
an
ancient
temple
of
Gothic
structure
upon
Salisbury
plain
,
famous
for
its
shrine
and
celebration
by
pilgrims
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
had
some
roguish
trick
to
play
,
he
would
down
with
his
knees
,
up
with
his
eyes
,
and
fall
to
prayers
though
in
the
midst
of
the
kennel
.
 
<EOS>
Then
it
was
that
those
who
understood
his
pranks
would
be
sure
to
get
far
enough
out
of
his
way
;
and
whenever
curiosity
attracted
strangers
to
laugh
or
to
listen
,
he
would
of
a
sudden
bespatter
them
with
mud
.
  
<EOS>
In
winter
he
went
always
loose
and
unbuttoned
,
and
clad
as
thin
as
possible
to
let
in
the
ambient
heat
,
and
in
summer
lapped
himself
close
and
thick
to
keep
it
out
.
  
<EOS>
In
all
revolutions
of
government
,
he
would
make
his
court
for
the
office
of
hangman
-
general
,
and
in
the
exercise
of
that
dignity
,
wherein
he
was
very
dexterous
,
would
make
use
of
no
other
vizard
than
a
long
prayer
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
a
tongue
so
musculous
and
subtile
,
that
he
could
twist
it
up
into
his
nose
and
deliver
a
strange
kind
of
speech
from
thence
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
also
the
first
in
these
kingdoms
who
began
to
improve
the
Spanish
accomplishment
of
braying
;
and
having
large
ears
perpetually
exposed
and
erected
,
he
carried
his
art
to
such
a
perfection
,
that
it
was
a
point
of
great
difficulty
to
distinguish
either
by
the
view
or
the
sound
between
the
original
and
the
copy
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
troubled
with
a
disease
the
reverse
to
that
called
the
stinging
of
the
tarantula
,
and
would
run
dog
-
mad
at
the
noise
of
music
,
especially
a
pair
of
bagpipes
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
would
cure
himself
again
by
taking
two
or
three
turns
in
Westminster
Hall
,
or
Billingsgate
,
or
in
a
boarding
-
school
,
or
the
Royal
Exchange
,
or
a
state
coffee
-
house
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
a
person
that
feared
no
colours
,
but
mortally
hated
all
,
and
upon
that
account
bore
a
cruel
aversion
to
painters
,
<EOS>
insomuch
that
in
his
paroxysms
as
he
walked
the
streets
,
he
would
have
his
pockets
loaded
with
stones
to
pelt
at
the
signs
.
  
<EOS>
Having
from
his
manner
of
living
frequent
occasions
to
wash
himself
,
he
would
often
leap
over
head
and
ears
into
the
water
,
though
it
were
in
the
midst
of
the
winter
,
but
was
always
observed
to
come
out
again
much
dirtier
,
if
possible
,
than
he
went
in
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
the
first
that
ever
found
out
the
secret
of
contriving
a
soporiferous
medicine
to
be
conveyed
in
at
the
ears
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
compound
of
sulphur
and
balm
of
Gilead
,
with
a
little
pilgrim
's
salve
.
  
<EOS>
He
wore
a
large
plaister
of
artificial
caustics
on
his
stomach
,
with
the
fervour
of
which
he
could
set
himself
a
groaning
like
the
famous
board
upon
application
of
a
red
-
hot
iron
.
  
<EOS>
He
would
stand
in
the
turning
of
a
street
,
and
calling
to
those
who
passed
by
,
would
cry
to
one
,
"
<EOS>
Worthy
sir
,
do
me
the
honour
of
a
good
slap
in
the
chaps
;
"
to
another
,
"
Honest
friend
,
pray
favour
me
with
a
handsome
kick
in
the
rear
;
"
"
Madam
,
shall
I
entreat
a
small
box
in
the
ear
from
your
ladyship
's
fair
hands
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Noble
captain
,
lend
a
reasonable
thwack
,
for
the
love
of
God
,
with
that
cane
of
yours
over
these
poor
shoulders
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
when
he
had
by
such
earnest
solicitations
made
a
shift
to
procure
a
basting
sufficient
to
swell
up
his
fancy
and
his
sides
,
he
would
return
home
extremely
comforted
,
and
full
of
terrible
accounts
of
what
he
had
undergone
for
the
public
good
.
 
<EOS>
"
Observe
this
stroke
,
"
said
he
,
showing
his
bare
shoulders
;
"
a
plaguy
janissary
gave
it
me
this
very
morning
at
seven
o'clock
,
as
,
with
much
ado
,
I
was
driving
off
the
Great
Turk
.
<EOS>
Neighbours
mine
,
this
broken
head
deserves
a
plaister
;
had
poor
Jack
been
tender
of
his
noddle
,
you
would
have
seen
the
Pope
and
the
French
King
long
before
this
time
of
day
among
your
wives
and
your
warehouses
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
Christians
,
the
Great
Moghul
was
come
as
far
as
Whitechapel
,
and
you
may
thank
these
poor
sides
that
he
hath
<EOS>
not
  
God
bless
<EOS>
us
 
already
swallowed
up
man
,
woman
,
and
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
highly
worth
observing
the
singular
effects
of
that
aversion
or
antipathy
which
Jack
and
his
brother
Peter
seemed
,
even
to
affectation
,
to
bear
towards
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
Peter
had
lately
done
some
rogueries
that
forced
him
to
abscond
,
and
he
seldom
ventured
to
stir
out
before
night
for
fear
of
bailiffs
.
 
<EOS>
Their
lodgings
were
at
the
two
most
distant
parts
of
the
town
from
each
other
,
and
whenever
their
occasions
or
humours
called
them
abroad
,
they
would
make
choice
of
the
oddest
,
unlikely
times
,
and
most
uncouth
rounds
that
they
could
invent
,
that
they
might
be
sure
to
avoid
one
another
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
after
all
this
,
it
was
their
perpetual
fortune
to
meet
,
the
reason
of
which
is
easy
enough
to
apprehend
,
for
the
frenzy
and
the
spleen
of
both
having
the
same
foundation
,
we
may
look
upon
them
as
two
pair
of
compasses
equally
extended
,
and
the
fixed
foot
of
each
remaining
in
the
same
centre
,
which
,
though
moving
contrary
ways
at
first
,
will
be
sure
to
encounter
somewhere
or
other
in
the
circumference
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
it
was
among
the
great
misfortunes
of
Jack
to
bear
a
huge
personal
resemblance
with
his
brother
Peter
.
 
<EOS>
Their
humour
and
dispositions
were
not
only
the
same
,
but
there
was
a
close
analogy
in
their
shape
,
their
size
,
and
their
mien
;
insomuch
as
nothing
was
more
frequent
than
for
a
bailiff
to
seize
Jack
by
the
shoulders
and
cry
,
"
Mr.
Peter
,
you
are
the
king
's
prisoner
;
"
or
,
at
other
times
,
for
one
of
Peter
's
nearest
friends
to
accost
Jack
with
open
arms
:
 
"
Dear
Peter
,
I
am
glad
to
see
thee
;
pray
send
me
one
of
your
best
medicines
for
the
worms
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
,
we
may
suppose
,
was
a
mortifying
return
of
those
pains
and
<EOS>
proceedings
Jack
had
laboured
in
so
long
,
and
finding
how
directly
opposite
all
his
endeavours
had
answered
to
the
sole
end
and
intention
which
he
had
proposed
to
himself
,
how
could
it
avoid
having
terrible
effects
upon
a
head
and
heart
so
furnished
as
his
?
 
<EOS>
However
,
the
poor
remainders
of
his
coat
bore
all
the
punishment
.
 
<EOS>
The
orient
sun
never
entered
upon
his
diurnal
progress
without
missing
a
piece
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
hired
a
tailor
to
stitch
up
the
collar
so
close
that
it
was
ready
to
choke
him
,
and
squeezed
out
his
eyes
at
such
a
rate
as
one
could
see
nothing
but
the
white
.
 
<EOS>
What
little
was
left
of
the
main
substance
of
the
coat
he
rubbed
every
day
for
two
hours
against
a
rough
-
cast
wall
,
in
order
to
grind
away
the
remnants
of
lace
and
embroidery
,
but
at
the
same
time
went
on
with
so
much
violence
that
he
proceeded
a
heathen
philosopher
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
after
all
he
could
do
of
this
kind
,
the
success
continued
still
to
disappoint
his
expectation
,
for
as
it
is
the
nature
of
rags
to
bear
a
kind
of
mock
resemblance
to
finery
,
there
being
a
sort
of
fluttering
appearance
in
both
,
which
is
not
to
be
distinguished
at
a
distance
in
the
dark
or
by
short
-
sighted
eyes
,
so
in
those
junctures
it
fared
with
Jack
and
his
tatters
,
that
they
offered
to
the
first
view
a
ridiculous
flaunting
,
which
,
assisting
the
resemblance
in
person
and
air
,
thwarted
all
his
projects
of
separation
,
and
left
so
near
a
similitude
between
them
as
frequently
deceived
the
very
disciples
and
followers
of
both
.
.
.
<EOS>
Desunt
nonnulla
,
.
.
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
Sclavonian
proverb
said
well
that
it
is
with
men
as
with
asses
;
whoever
would
keep
them
fast
must
find
a
very
good
hold
at
their
ears
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
I
think
we
may
affirm
,
and
it
hath
been
verified
by
repeated
experience
,
that
     
"
Effugiet
tamen
haec
sceleratus
vincula
Proteus
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
It
is
good
,
therefore
,
to
read
the
maxims
of
our
ancestors
with
great
allowances
to
times
and
persons
;
for
if
we
look
into
primitive
records
we
shall
find
that
no
revolutions
have
been
so
great
or
so
frequent
as
those
of
human
ears
.
 
<EOS>
In
former
days
there
was
a
curious
invention
to
catch
and
keep
them
,
which
I
think
we
may
justly
reckon
among
the
artes
perditae
;
and
how
can
it
be
otherwise
,
when
in
these
latter
centuries
the
very
species
is
not
only
diminished
to
a
very
lamentable
degree
,
but
the
poor
remainder
is
also
degenerated
so
far
as
to
mock
our
skilfullest
tenure
?
 
<EOS>
For
if
only
the
slitting
of
one
ear
in
a
stag
hath
been
found
sufficient
to
propagate
the
defect
through
a
whole
forest
,
why
should
we
wonder
at
the
greatest
consequences
,
from
so
many
loppings
and
mutilations
to
which
the
ears
of
our
fathers
and
our
own
have
been
of
late
so
much
exposed
?
<EOS>
It
is
true
,
indeed
,
that
while
this
island
of
ours
was
under
the
dominion
of
grace
,
many
endeavours
were
made
to
improve
the
growth
of
ears
once
more
among
us
.
 
<EOS>
The
proportion
of
largeness
was
not
only
looked
upon
as
an
ornament
of
the
outward
man
,
but
as
a
type
of
grace
in
the
inward
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
it
is
held
by
naturalists
that
if
there
be
a
protuberancy
of
parts
in
the
superior
region
of
the
body
,
as
in
the
ears
and
nose
,
there
must
be
a
parity
also
in
the
inferior
;
and
therefore
in
that
truly
pious
age
the
males
in
every
assembly
,
according
as
they
were
gifted
,
appeared
very
forward
in
exposing
their
ears
to
view
,
and
the
regions
about
them
;
because
Hippocrates
 
tells
us
that
when
the
vein
behind
the
ear
happens
to
be
cut
,
a
man
becomes
a
eunuch
,
and
the
females
were
nothing
backwarder
in
beholding
and
edifying
by
them
;
whereof
those
who
had
already
used
the
means
looked
about
them
with
great
concern
,
in
hopes
of
conceiving
a
suitable
offspring
by
such
a
prospect
;
others
,
who
stood
candidates
for
benevolence
,
found
there
a
plentiful
choice
,
and
were
sure
to
fix
upon
such
as
discovered
the
largest
ears
,
that
the
breed
might
not
dwindle
between
them
.
<EOS>
Lastly
,
the
devouter
sisters
,
who
looked
upon
all
extraordinary
dilatations
of
that
member
as
protrusions
of
zeal
,
or
spiritual
excrescences
,
were
sure
to
honour
every
head
they
sat
upon
as
if
they
had
been
cloven
tongues
,
but
especially
that
of
the
preacher
,
whose
ears
were
usually
of
the
prime
magnitude
,
which
upon
that
account
he
was
very
frequent
and
exact
in
exposing
with
all
advantages
to
the
people
in
his
rhetorical
paroxysms
,
turning
sometimes
to
hold
forth
the
one
,
and
sometimes
to
hold
forth
the
other
;
from
which
custom
the
whole
operation
of
preaching
is
to
this
very
day
among
their
professors
styled
by
the
phrase
of
holding
forth
.
  
<EOS>
Such
was
the
progress
of
the
saints
for
advancing
the
size
of
that
member
,
and
it
is
thought
the
success
would
have
been
every
way
answerable
,
if
in
process
of
time
a
cruel
king
had
not
arose
,
who
raised
a
bloody
persecution
against
all
ears
above
a
certain
standard
;
upon
which
some
were
glad
to
hide
their
flourishing
sprouts
in
a
black
border
,
others
crept
wholly
under
a
periwig
;
some
were
slit
,
others
cropped
,
and
a
great
number
sliced
off
to
the
stumps
.
 
<EOS>
But
of
this
more
hereafter
in
my
general
"
History
of
Ears
,
"
which
I
design
very
speedily
to
bestow
upon
the
public
.
  
<EOS>
From
this
brief
survey
of
the
falling
state
of
ears
in
the
last
age
,
and
the
small
care
had
to
advance
their
ancient
growth
in
the
present
,
it
is
manifest
how
little
reason
we
can
have
to
rely
upon
a
hold
so
short
,
so
weak
,
and
so
slippery
;
and
that
whoever
desires
to
catch
mankind
fast
must
have
recourse
to
some
other
methods
.
 
<EOS>
Now
he
that
will
examine
human
nature
with
circumspection
enough
may
discover
several
handles
,
whereof
the
six
 
senses
afford
one
apiece
,
beside
a
great
number
that
are
screwed
to
the
passions
,
and
some
few
riveted
to
the
intellect
.
 
<EOS>
Among
these
last
,
curiosity
is
one
,
and
of
all
others
affords
the
firmest
grasp
;
curiosity
,
that
spur
in
the
side
,
that
bridle
in
the
mouth
,
that
ring
in
the
nose
of
a
lazy
,
an
impatient
,
and
a
grunting
reader
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
handle
it
is
that
an
author
should
seize
upon
his
readers
;
which
as
soon
as
he
hath
once
compassed
,
all
resistance
and
struggling
are
in
vain
,
and
they
become
his
prisoners
as
close
as
he
pleases
,
till
weariness
or
dulness
force
him
to
let
go
his
grip
.
  
<EOS>
And
therefore
I
,
the
author
of
this
miraculous
treatise
,
having
hitherto
,
beyond
expectation
,
maintained
by
the
aforesaid
handle
a
firm
hold
upon
my
gentle
readers
<EOS>
,
it
is
with
great
reluctance
that
I
am
at
length
compelled
to
remit
my
grasp
,
leaving
them
in
the
perusal
of
what
remains
to
that
natural
oscitancy
inherent
in
the
tribe
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
only
assure
thee
,
courteous
reader
,
for
both
our
comforts
,
that
my
concern
is
altogether
equal
to
thine
,
for
my
unhappiness
in
losing
or
mislaying
among
my
papers
the
remaining
part
of
these
memoirs
,
which
consisted
of
accidents
,
turns
,
and
adventures
,
both
new
,
agreeable
,
and
surprising
,
and
therefore
calculated
in
all
due
points
to
the
delicate
taste
of
this
our
noble
age
.
 
<EOS>
But
alas
!
<EOS>
with
my
utmost
endeavours
I
have
been
able
only
to
retain
a
few
of
the
heads
.
 
<EOS>
Under
which
there
was
a
full
account
how
Peter
got
a
protection
out
of
the
King
's
Bench
,
and
of
a
reconcilement
between
Jack
and
him
,
upon
a
design
they
had
in
a
certain
rainy
night
to
trepan
brother
Martin
into
a
spunging
-
house
,
and
there
strip
him
to
the
skin
.
 
<EOS>
How
Martin
,
with
much
ado
,
showed
them
both
a
fair
pair
of
heels
.
 
<EOS>
How
a
new
warrant
came
out
against
Peter
,
upon
which
Jack
left
him
in
the
lurch
,
stole
his
protection
,
and
made
use
of
it
himself
.
 
<EOS>
How
Jack
's
tatters
came
into
fashion
in
court
and
city
;
how
he
got
upon
a
great
horse
and
ate
custard
.
<EOS>
But
the
particulars
of
all
these
,
with
several
others
which
have
now
slid
out
of
my
memory
,
are
lost
beyond
all
hopes
of
recovery
.
 
<EOS>
For
which
misfortune
,
leaving
my
readers
to
condole
with
each
other
as
far
as
they
shall
find
it
to
agree
with
their
several
constitutions
,
but
conjuring
them
by
all
the
friendship
that
has
passed
between
us
,
from
the
title
-
page
to
this
,
not
to
proceed
so
far
as
to
injure
their
healths
for
an
accident
past
remedy
,
I
now
go
on
to
the
ceremonial
part
of
an
accomplished
writer
,
and
therefore
by
a
courtly
modern
least
of
all
others
to
be
omitted
.
  
<EOS>
THE
CONCLUSION
.
  
<EOS>
Going
too
long
is
a
cause
of
abortion
as
effectual
,
though
not
so
frequent
,
as
going
too
short
,
and
holds
true
especially
in
the
labours
of
the
brain
.
 
<EOS>
Well
fare
the
heart
of
that
noble
Jesuit
 
<EOS>
who
first
adventured
to
confess
in
print
that
books
must
be
suited
to
their
several
seasons
,
like
dress
,
and
diet
,
and
diversions
;
and
better
fare
our
noble
notion
for
refining
upon
this
among
other
French
modes
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
living
fast
to
see
the
time
when
a
book
that
misses
its
tide
shall
be
neglected
as
the
moon
by
day
,
or
like
mackerel
a
week
after
the
season
.
 
<EOS>
No
man
has
more
nicely
observed
our
climate
than
the
bookseller
who
bought
the
copy
of
this
work
.
 
<EOS>
He
knows
to
a
tittle
what
subjects
will
best
go
off
in
a
dry
year
,
and
which
it
is
proper
to
expose
foremost
when
the
weather
-
glass
is
fallen
to
much
rain
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
seen
this
treatise
and
consulted
his
almanac
upon
it
,
he
gave
me
to
understand
that
he
had
manifestly
considered
the
two
principal
things
,
which
were
the
bulk
and
the
subject
,
and
found
it
would
never
take
but
after
a
long
vacation
,
and
then
only
in
case
it
should
happen
to
be
a
hard
year
for
turnips
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
which
I
desired
to
know
,
considering
my
urgent
necessities
,
what
he
thought
might
be
acceptable
this
month
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
westward
and
said
,
"
I
doubt
we
shall
have
a
bit
of
bad
weather
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
if
you
could
prepare
some
pretty
little
banter
(
but
not
in
verse
)
,
or
a
small
treatise
upon
the
it
would
run
like
wildfire
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
it
hold
up
,
I
have
already
hired
an
author
to
write
something
against
Dr.
Bentley
,
which
I
am
sure
will
turn
to
account
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
length
we
agreed
upon
this
expedient
,
that
when
a
customer
comes
for
one
of
these
,
and
desires
in
confidence
to
know
the
author
,
he
will
tell
him
very
privately
as
a
friend
,
naming
whichever
of
the
wits
shall
happen
to
be
that
week
in
the
vogue
,
and
if
Durfey
's
last
play
should
be
in
course
,
I
had
as
lieve
he
may
be
the
person
as
Congreve
.
 
<EOS>
This
<EOS>
I
mention
,
because
I
am
wonderfully
well
acquainted
with
the
present
relish
of
courteous
readers
,
and
have
often
observed
,
with
singular
pleasure
,
that
a
fly
driven
from
a
honey
-
pot
will
immediately
,
with
very
good
appetite
,
alight
and
finish
his
meal
on
an
excrement
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
one
word
to
say
upon
the
subject
of
profound
writers
,
who
are
grown
very
numerous
of
late
,
and
I
know
very
well
the
judicious
world
is
resolved
to
list
me
in
that
number
.
 
<EOS>
I
conceive
,
therefore
,
as
to
the
business
of
being
profound
,
that
it
is
with
writers
as
with
wells
.
 
<EOS>
A
person
with
good
eyes
can
see
to
the
bottom
of
the
deepest
,
provided
any
water
be
there
;
and
that
often
when
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
at
the
bottom
besides
dryness
and
dirt
,
though
it
be
but
a
yard
and
half
under
ground
,
it
shall
pass
,
however
,
for
wondrous
deep
,
upon
no
wiser
a
reason
than
because
it
is
wondrous
dark
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
now
trying
an
experiment
very
frequent
among
modern
authors
,
which
is
to
write
upon
nothing
,
when
the
subject
is
utterly
exhausted
to
let
the
pen
still
move
on
;
by
some
called
the
ghost
of
wit
,
delighting
to
walk
after
the
death
of
its
body
.
 
<EOS>
And
to
say
the
truth
,
there
seems
to
be
no
part
of
knowledge
in
fewer
hands
than
that
of
discerning
when
to
have
done
.
 
<EOS>
By
the
time
that
an
author
has
written
out
a
book
,
he
and
his
readers
are
become
old
acquaintance
,
and
grow
very
loathe
to
part
;
so
that
I
have
sometimes
known
it
to
be
in
writing
as
in
visiting
,
where
the
ceremony
of
taking
leave
has
employed
more
time
than
the
whole
conversation
before
.
 
<EOS>
The
conclusion
of
a
treatise
resembles
the
conclusion
of
human
life
,
which
has
sometimes
been
compared
to
the
end
of
a
feast
,
where
few
are
satisfied
to
depart
ut
plenus
vitae
conviva
.
 
<EOS>
For
men
will
sit
down
after
the
fullest
meal
,
though
it
be
only
to
dose
or
to
sleep
out
the
rest
of
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
this
latter
I
differ
extremely
from
other
writers
,
and
shall
be
too
proud
if
,
by
all
my
labours
,
I
can
have
any
ways
contributed
to
the
repose
of
mankind
in
times
so
turbulent
and
unquiet
as
these
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
<EOS>
do
I
think
such
an
employment
so
very
alien
from
the
office
of
a
wit
as
some
would
suppose
;
for
among
a
very
polite
nation
in
Greece
 
there
were
the
same
temples
built
and
consecrated
to
Sleep
and
the
Muses
,
between
which
two
deities
they
believed
the
strictest
friendship
was
established
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
one
concluding
favour
to
request
of
my
reader
,
that
he
will
not
expect
to
be
equally
diverted
and
informed
by
every
line
or
every
page
of
this
discourse
,
but
give
some
allowance
to
the
author
's
spleen
and
short
fits
or
intervals
of
dulness
,
as
well
as
his
own
,
and
lay
it
seriously
to
his
conscience
whether
,
if
he
were
walking
the
streets
in
dirty
weather
or
a
rainy
day
,
he
would
allow
it
fair
dealing
in
folks
at
their
ease
from
a
window
,
to
criticise
his
gate
and
ridicule
his
dress
at
such
a
juncture
.
  
<EOS>
In
my
disposure
of
employments
of
the
brain
,
I
have
thought
fit
to
make
invention
the
master
,
and
to
give
method
and
reason
the
office
of
its
lackeys
.
 
<EOS>
The
cause
of
this
distribution
was
from
observing
it
my
peculiar
case
to
be
often
under
a
temptation
of
being
witty
upon
occasion
where
I
could
be
neither
wise
nor
sound
,
nor
anything
to
the
matter
in
hand
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
am
too
much
a
servant
of
the
modern
way
to
neglect
any
such
opportunities
,
whatever
pains
or
improprieties
<EOS>
I
may
be
at
to
introduce
them
.
 
<EOS>
For
I
have
observed
that
from
a
laborious
collection
of
seven
hundred
and
thirty
-
eight
flowers
and
shining
hints
of
the
best
modern
authors
,
digested
with
great
reading
into
my
book
of
common
places
,
I
have
not
been
able
after
five
years
to
draw
,
hook
,
or
force
into
common
conversation
any
more
than
a
dozen
.
 
<EOS>
Of
which
dozen
the
one
moiety
failed
of
success
by
being
dropped
among
unsuitable
company
,
and
the
other
cost
me
so
many
strains
,
and
traps
,
and
ambages
to
introduce
,
that
I
at
length
resolved
to
give
it
over
.
 
<EOS>
Now
this
disappointment
(
to
discover
a
secret
)
,
I
must
own
,
gave
me
the
first
hint
of
setting
up
for
an
author
,
and
I
have
since
found
among
some
particular
friends
that
it
is
become
a
very
general
complaint
,
and
has
produced
the
same
effects
upon
many
others
.
 
<EOS>
For
I
have
remarked
many
a
towardly
word
to
be
wholly
neglected
or
despised
in
discourse
,
which
hath
passed
very
smoothly
with
some
consideration
and
esteem
after
its
preferment
and
sanction
in
print
.
 
<EOS>
But
now
,
since
,
by
the
liberty
and
encouragement
of
the
press
,
I
am
grown
absolute
master
of
the
occasions
and
opportunities
to
expose
the
talents
I
have
acquired
<EOS>
,
I
already
discover
that
the
issues
of
my
observanda
begin
to
grow
too
large
for
the
receipts
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
I
shall
here
<EOS>
pause
<EOS>
awhile
,
till
I
find
,
by
feeling
the
world
's
pulse
and
my
own
,
that
it
will
be
of
absolute
necessity
for
us
both
to
resume
my
pen
.

THE
HISTORY
OF
MARTIN
.
  
<EOS>
Giving
an
account
of
his
departure
from
Jack
,
and
their
setting
up
for
themselves
,
on
which
account
they
were
obliged
to
travel
,
and
meet
many
disasters
;
finding
no
shelter
near
Peter
's
habitation
,
Martin
succeeds
in
the
North
;
Peter
thunders
against
Martin
for
the
loss
of
the
large
revenue
he
used
to
receive
from
thence
;
Harry
Huff
sent
Marlin
a
challenge
in
fight
,
which
he
received
;
Peter
rewards
Harry
for
the
pretended
victory
,
which
encouraged
Harry
to
huff
Peter
also
;
with
many
other
extraordinary
adventures
of
the
said
Martin
in
several
places
with
many
considerable
persons
.
  
<EOS>
With
a
digression
concerning
the
nature
,
usefulness
,
and
necessity
of
wars
and
quarrels
.
  
<EOS>
How
Jack
and
Martin
,
being
parted
,
set
up
each
for
himself
.
 
<EOS>
How
they
travelled
over
hills
and
dales
,
met
many
disasters
,
suffered
much
from
the
good
cause
,
and
struggled
with
difficulties
and
wants
,
not
having
where
to
lay
their
head
;
by
all
which
they
afterwards
proved
themselves
to
be
right
father
's
sons
,
and
Peter
to
be
spurious
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
no
shelter
near
Peter
's
habitation
,
Martin
travelled
northwards
,
and
finding
the
Thuringians
,
a
neighbouring
people
,
disposed
to
change
,
he
set
up
his
stage
first
among
them
,
where
,
making
it
his
business
to
cry
down
Peter
's
powders
,
plasters
,
salves
,
and
drugs
,
which
he
had
sold
a
long
time
at
a
dear
rate
,
allowing
Martin
none
of
the
profit
,
though
he
had
been
often
employed
in
recommending
and
putting
them
off
,
the
good
people
,
willing
to
save
their
pence
,
began
to
hearken
to
Martin
's
speeches
.
<EOS>
How
several
great
lords
took
the
hint
,
and
on
the
same
account
declared
for
Martin
;
particularly
one
who
,
not
having
had
enough
of
one
wife
,
wanted
to
marry
a
second
,
and
knowing
Peter
used
not
to
grant
such
licenses
but
at
a
swingeing
price
,
he
struck
up
a
bargain
with
Martin
,
whom
he
found
more
tractable
,
and
who
assured
him
he
had
the
same
power
to
allow
such
things
.
 
<EOS>
How
most
of
the
other
Northern
lords
,
for
their
own
private
ends
,
withdrew
themselves
and
their
dependants
from
Peter
's
authority
,
and
closed
in
with
Martin
.
<EOS>
How
Peter
,
enraged
at
the
loss
of
such
large
territories
,
and
consequently
of
so
much
revenue
,
thundered
against
Martin
,
and
sent
out
the
strongest
and
most
terrible
of
his
bulls
to
devour
him
;
but
this
having
no
effect
,
and
Martin
defending
himself
boldly
and
dexterously
,
Peter
at
last
put
forth
proclamations
declaring
Martin
and
all
his
adherents
rebels
and
traitors
,
ordaining
and
requiring
all
his
loving
subjects
to
take
up
arms
,
and
to
kill
,
burn
,
and
destroy
all
and
every
one
of
them
,
promising
large
rewards
,
&
c.
,
upon
which
ensued
bloody
wars
and
desolation
.
  
<EOS>
How
Harry
Huff
,
lord
of
Albion
,
one
of
the
greatest
bullies
of
those
days
,
sent
a
cartel
to
Martin
to
fight
him
on
a
stage
at
Cudgels
,
quarter
-
staff
,
backsword
,
&
c.
 
<EOS>
Hence
the
origin
of
that
genteel
custom
of
prize
-
fighting
so
well
known
and
practised
to
this
day
among
those
polite
islanders
,
though
unknown
everywhere
else
.
<EOS>
How
Martin
,
being
a
bold
,
blustering
fellow
,
accepted
the
challenge
;
how
they
met
and
fought
,
to
the
great
diversion
of
the
spectators
;
and
,
after
giving
one
another
broken
heads
and
many
bloody
wounds
and
bruises
,
how
they
both
drew
off
victorious
,
in
which
their
example
has
been
frequently
imitated
by
great
clerks
and
others
since
that
time
.
 
<EOS>
How
Martin
's
friends
applauded
his
victory
,
and
how
Lord
Harry
's
friends
complimented
him
on
the
same
score
,
and
particularly
Lord
Peter
,
who
sent
him
a
fine
feather
for
his
cap
,
to
be
worn
by
him
and
his
successors
as
a
perpetual
mark
for
his
bold
defence
of
Lord
Peter
's
cause
.
 
<EOS>
How
Harry
,
flushed
with
his
pretended
victory
over
Martin
,
began
to
huff
Peter
also
,
and
at
last
downright
quarrelled
with
him
about
a
wench
.
 
<EOS>
How
some
of
Lord
Harry
's
tenants
,
ever
fond
of
changes
,
began
to
talk
kindly
of
Martin
,
for
which
he
mauled
them
soundly
,
as
he
did
also
those
that
adhered
to
Peter
.
 
<EOS>
How
he
turned
some
out
of
house
and
hold
,
others
he
hanged
or
burnt
,
&
c.
  
<EOS>
How
Harry
Huff
,
after
a
deal
of
blustering
,
wenching
,
and
bullying
,
died
,
and
was
succeeded
by
a
good
-
natured
boy
,
who
,
giving
way
to
the
general
bent
of
his
tenants
,
allowed
Martin
's
notions
to
spread
everywhere
,
and
take
deep
root
in
Ambition
.
 
<EOS>
How
,
after
his
death
,
the
farm
fell
into
the
hands
of
a
lady
,
who
was
violently
in
love
with
Lord
Peter
.
 
<EOS>
How
she
purged
the
whole
country
with
fire
and
sword
,
resolved
not
to
leave
the
name
or
remembrance
of
Martin
.
 
<EOS>
How
Peter
triumphed
,
and
set
up
shops
again
for
selling
his
own
powders
,
plasters
,
and
salves
,
which
were
now
declared
the
only
true
ones
,
Martin
's
being
all
declared
counterfeit
.
 
<EOS>
How
great
numbers
of
Martin
's
friends
left
the
country
,
and
,
travelling
up
and
down
in
foreign
parts
,
grew
acquainted
with
many
of
Jack
's
followers
,
and
took
a
liking
to
many
of
their
notions
and
ways
,
which
they
afterwards
brought
back
into
ambition
,
now
under
another
landlady
,
more
moderate
and
more
cunning
than
the
former
.
<EOS>
How
she
endeavoured
to
keep
friendship
both
with
Peter
and
Martin
,
and
trimmed
for
some
time
between
the
two
,
not
without
countenancing
and
assisting
at
the
same
time
many
of
Jack
's
followers
;
but
finding
,
no
possibility
of
reconciling
all
the
three
brothers
,
because
each
would
be
master
,
and
allow
no
other
salves
,
powders
,
or
plasters
to
be
used
but
his
own
,
she
discarded
all
three
,
and
set
up
a
shop
for
those
of
her
own
farm
,
well
furnished
with
powders
,
plasters
,
salves
,
and
all
other
drugs
necessary
,
all
right
and
true
,
composed
according
to
receipts
made
by
physicians
and
apothecaries
of
her
own
creating
,
which
they
extracted
out
of
Peter
's
,
and
Martin
's
,
and
Jack
's
receipt
-
books
,
and
of
this
medley
or
hodge
-
podge
made
up
a
dispensatory
of
their
own
,
strictly
forbidding
any
other
to
be
used
,
and
particularly
Peter
's
,
from
which
the
greatest
part
of
this
new
dispensatory
was
stolen
.
 
<EOS>
How
the
lady
,
farther
to
confirm
this
change
,
wisely
imitating
her
father
,
degraded
Peter
from
the
rank
he
pretended
as
eldest
brother
,
and
set
up
herself
in
his
place
as
head
of
the
family
,
and
ever
after
wore
her
father
's
old
cap
with
the
fine
feather
he
had
got
from
Peter
for
standing
his
friend
,
which
has
likewise
been
worn
with
no
small
ostentation
to
this
day
by
all
her
successors
,
though
declared
enemies
to
Peter
.
<EOS>
How
Lady
Bess
and
her
physicians
,
being
told
of
many
defects
and
imperfections
in
their
new
medley
dispensatory
,
resolve
on
a
further
alteration
,
to
purge
it
from
a
great
deal
of
Peter
's
trash
that
still
remained
in
it
,
but
were
prevented
by
her
death
.
 
<EOS>
How
she
was
succeeded
by
a
North
-
Country
farmer
,
who
pretended
great
skill
in
the
managing
of
farms
,
though
he
could
never
govern
his
own
poor
little
farm
,
nor
yet
this
large
new
one
after
he
got
it
.
 
<EOS>
How
this
new
landlord
,
to
show
his
valour
and
dexterity
,
fought
against
enchanters
,
weeds
,
giants
,
and
windmills
,
and
claimed
great
honour
for
his
victories
.
 
<EOS>
How
his
successor
,
no
wiser
than
he
,
occasioned
great
disorders
by
the
new
methods
he
took
to
manage
his
farms
.
 
<EOS>
How
he
attempted
to
establish
in
his
Northern
farm
the
same
dispensatory
 
used
in
the
Southern
,
but
miscarried
,
because
Jack
's
powders
,
pills
,
salves
,
and
plasters
were
there
in
great
vogue
.
  
<EOS>
How
the
author
finds
himself
embarrassed
for
having
introduced
into
his
history
a
new
sect
different
from
the
three
he
had
undertaken
to
treat
of
;
and
how
his
inviolable
respect
to
the
sacred
number
three
obliges
him
to
reduce
these
four
,
as
he
intends
to
do
all
other
things
,
to
that
number
;
and
for
that
end
to
drop
the
former
Martin
and
to
substitute
in
his
place
Lady
Bess
's
institution
,
which
is
to
pass
under
the
name
of
Martin
in
the
sequel
of
this
true
history
.
<EOS>
This
weighty
point
being
cleared
,
the
author
goes
on
and
describes
mighty
quarrels
and
squabbles
between
Jack
and
Martin
;
how
sometimes
the
one
had
the
better
and
sometimes
the
other
,
to
the
great
desolation
of
both
farms
,
till
at
last
both
sides
concur
to
hang
up
the
landlord
,
who
pretended
to
die
a
martyr
for
Martin
,
though
he
had
been
true
to
neither
side
,
and
was
suspected
by
many
to
have
a
great
affection
for
Peter
.

A
DIGRESSION
ON
THE
NATURE
,
USEFULNESS
,
AND
NECESSITY
OF
WARS
AND
QUARRELS
.
  
<EOS>
This
being
a
matter
of
great
consequence
,
the
author
intends
to
treat
it
methodically
and
at
large
in
a
treatise
apart
,
and
here
to
give
only
some
hints
of
what
his
large
treatise
contains
.
 
<EOS>
The
state
of
war
,
natural
to
all
creatures
.
 
<EOS>
War
is
an
attempt
to
take
by
violence
from
others
a
part
of
what
they
have
and
we
want
.
 
<EOS>
Every
man
,
fully
sensible
of
his
own
merit
,
and
finding
it
not
duly
regarded
by
others
,
has
a
natural
right
to
take
from
them
all
that
he
thinks
due
to
himself
;
and
every
creature
,
finding
its
own
wants
more
than
those
of
others
,
has
the
same
right
to
take
everything
its
nature
requires
.
 
<EOS>
Brutes
,
much
more
modest
in
their
pretensions
this
way
than
men
,
and
mean
men
more
than
great
ones
.
 
<EOS>
The
higher
one
raises
his
pretensions
this
way
,
the
more
bustle
he
makes
about
them
,
and
the
more
success
he
has
,
the
greater
hero
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
greater
souls
,
in
proportion
to
their
superior
merit
,
claim
a
greater
right
to
take
everything
from
meaner
folks
.
 
<EOS>
This
the
true
foundation
of
grandeur
and
heroism
,
and
of
the
distinction
of
degrees
among
men
.
<EOS>
War
,
therefore
,
necessary
to
establish
subordination
,
and
to
found
cities
,
kingdoms
,
&
c.
,
as
also
to
purge
bodies
politic
of
gross
humours
.
 
<EOS>
Wise
princes
find
it
necessary
to
have
wars
abroad
to
keep
peace
at
home

<EOS>
War
,
famine
,
and
pestilence
,
the
usual
cures
for
corruption
in
bodies
politic
.
 
<EOS>
A
comparison
of
these
three
 
<EOS>
the
author
is
to
write
a
panegyric
on
each
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
greatest
part
of
mankind
loves
war
more
than
peace
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
but
few
and
mean
-
spirited
that
live
in
peace
with
all
men
.
 
<EOS>
The
modest
and
meek
of
all
kinds
always
a
prey
to
those
of
more
noble
or
stronger
appetites
.
 
<EOS>
The
inclination
to
war
universal
;
those
that
can
not
or
dare
not
make
war
in
person
employ
others
to
do
it
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
This
maintains
bullies
,
bravoes
,
cut

throats
,
lawyers
,
soldiers
,
&
<EOS>
c.
Most
professions
would
be
useless
if
all
were
peaceable
.
 
<EOS>
Hence
brutes
want
neither
smiths
nor
lawyers
,
magistrates
nor
joiners
,
soldiers
or
surgeons
.
 
<EOS>
Brutes
having
but
narrow
appetites

are
incapable
of
carrying
on
or
perpetuating
war
against
their
own
species

or
of
being
led
out
in
troops
and

to

one
another

These
prerogatives
proper
to

human

THE
HISTORY
OF
MARTIN
 
Continued
.
  
<EOS>
How
Jack
,
having
got
rid
of
the
old
landlord
,
set
up
another
to
his
mind
,
quarrelled
with
Martin
,
and
turned
him
out
of
doors
.
 
<EOS>
How
he
pillaged
all
his
shops
,
and
abolished
his
whole
dispensatory
.
 
<EOS>
How
the
new
landlord
 
laid
about
him
,
mauled
Peter
,
worried
Martin
,
and
made
the
whole
neighbourhood
tremble
.
 
<EOS>
How
Jack
's
friends
fell
out
among
themselves
,
split
into
a
thousand
parties
,
turned
all
things
topsy
-
turvy
,
till
everybody
grew
weary
of
them
;
and
at
last
,
the
blustering
landlord
dying
,
Jack
was
kicked
out
of
doors
,
a
new
landlord
 
brought
in
,
and
Martin
re
-
established
.
<EOS>
How
this
new
landlord
let
Martin
do
what
he
pleased
,
and
Martin
agreed
to
everything
his
pious
landlord
desired
,
provided
Jack
might
be
kept
low
.
 
<EOS>
Of
several
efforts
Jack
made
to
raise
up
his
head
,
but
all
in
vain
;
till
at
last
the
landlord
died
,
and
was
succeeded
by
one
 
who
was
a
great
friend
to
Peter
,
who
,
to
humble
Martin
,
gave
Jack
some
liberty
.
 
<EOS>
How
Martin
grew
enraged
at
this
,
called
in
a
foreigner
 
and
turned
out
the
landlord
;
in
which
Jack
concurred
with
Martin
,
because
this
landlord
was
entirely
devoted
to
Peter
,
into
whose
arms
he
threw
himself
,
and
left
his
country
.
 
<EOS>
How
the
new
landlord
secured
Martin
in
the
full
possession
of
his
former
rights
,
but
would
not
allow
him
to
destroy
Jack
,
who
had
always
been
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
How
Jack
got
up
his
head
in
the
North
,
and
put
himself
in
possession
of
a
whole
canton
,
to
the
great
discontent
of
Martin
,
who
finding
also
that
some
of
Jack
's
friends
were
allowed
to
live
and
get
their
bread
in
the
south
parts
of
the
country
,
grew
highly
discontented
with
the
new
landlord
he
had
called
in
to
his
assistance
.
 
<EOS>
How
this
landlord
kept
Martin
in
order
,
upon
which
he
fell
into
a
raging
fever
,
and
swore
he
would
hang
himself
or
join
in
with
Peter
,
unless
Jack
's
children
were
all
turned
out
to
starve
.
<EOS>
Of
several
attempts
to
cure
Martin
,
and
make
peace
between
him
and
Jack
,
that
they
might
unite
against
Peter
;
but
all
made
ineffectual
by
the
great
address
of
a
number
of
Peter
's
friends
,
that
herded
among
Martin
's
,
and
appeared
the
most
zealous
for
his
interest
.
 
<EOS>
How
Martin
,
getting
abroad
in
this
mad
fit
,
looked
so
like
Peter
in
his
air
and
dress
,
and
talked
so
like
him
,
that
many
of
the
neighbours
could
not
distinguish
the
one
from
the
other
;
especially
when
Martin
went
up
and
down
strutting
in
Peter
's
armour
,
which
he
had
borrowed
to
fight
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
What
remedies
were
used
to
cure
Martin
's
distemper
.

<EOS>
Here
the
author
being
seized
with
a
fit
of
dulness
,
to
which
he
is
very
subject
,
after
having
read
a
poetical
epistle
addressed
to
.
.
.
<EOS>
it
entirely
composed
his
senses
,
so
that
he
has
not
writ
a

N.B.

Some
things
that
follow
after
this
are
not
in
the
MS

but
seem
to
have
been
written

to
fill
up
the

of
what
was
not
thought
convenient

A
PROJECT
FOR
THE
UNIVERSAL
BENEFIT
OF
MANKIND
.
  
<EOS>
The
author
,
having
laboured
so
long
and
done
so
much
to
serve
and
instruct
the
public
,
without
any
advantage
to
himself
,
has
at
last
thought
of
a
project
which
will
tend
to
the
great
benefit
of
all
mankind
,
and
produce
a
handsome
revenue
to
the
author
.
 
<EOS>
He
intends
to
print
by
subscription
,
in
ninety
-
six
large
volumes
in
folio
,
an
exact
description
of
Terra
Australis
incognita
,
collected
with
great
care
,
and
prints
from
999
learned
and
pious
authors
of
undoubted
veracity
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
work
,
illustrated
with
maps
and
cuts
agreeable
to
the
subject
,
and
done
by
the
best
masters
,
will
cost
but
one
guinea
each
volume
to
subscribers
,
one
guinea
to
be
paid
in
advance
,
and
afterwards
a
guinea
on
receiving
each
volume
,
except
the
last
.
<EOS>
This
work
will
be
of
great
use
for
all
men
,
and
necessary
for
all
families
,
because
it
contains
exact
accounts
of
all
the
provinces
,
colonies
,
and
mansions
of
that
spacious
country
,
where
,
by
a
general
doom
,
all
transgressors
of
the
law
are
to
be
transported
;
and
every
one
having
this
work
may
choose
out
the
fittest
and
best
place
for
himself
,
there
being
enough
for
all
,
so
as
every
one
shall
be
fully
satisfied
.
  
<EOS>
The
author
supposes
that
one
copy
of
this
work
will
be
bought
at
the
public
charge
,
or
out
of
the
parish
rates
,
for
every
parish
church
in
the
three
kingdoms
,
and
in
all
the
dominions
thereunto
belonging
.
<EOS>
And
that
every
family
that
can
command
10
pounds
per
annum
,
even
though
retrenched
from
less
necessary
expenses
,
will
subscribe
for
one
.
 
<EOS>
He
does
not
think
of
giving
out
above
nine
volumes
nearly
;
and
considering
the
number
requisite
,
he
intends
to
print
at
least
100,000
for
the
first
edition
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
to
print
proposals
against
next
term
,
with
a
specimen
,
and
a
curious
map
of
the
capital
city
with
its
twelve
gates
,
from
a
known
author
,
who
took
an
exact
survey
of
it
in
a
dream
.
 
<EOS>
Considering
the
great
care
and
pains
of
the
author
,
and
the
usefulness
of
the
work
,
he
hopes
every
one
will
be
ready
,
for
their
own
good
as
well
as
his
,
to
contribute
cheerfully
to
it
,
and
not
grudge
him
the
profit
he
may
have
by
it
,
especially
if
he
comes
to
a
third
or
fourth
edition
,
as
he
expects
it
will
very
soon
.
  
<EOS>
He
doubts
not
but
it
will
be
translated
into
foreign
languages
by
most
nations
of
Europe
,
as
well
as
Asia
and
Africa
,
being
of
as
great
use
to
all
those
nations
as
to
his
own
;
for
this
reason
he
designs
to
procure
patents
and
privileges
for
securing
the
whole
benefit
to
himself
from
all
those
different
princes
and
states
,
and
hopes
to
see
many
millions
of
this
great
work
printed
in
those
different
countries
and
languages
before
his
death
.
  
<EOS>
After
this
business
is
pretty
well
established
,
he
has
promised
to
put
a
friend
on
another
project
almost
as
good
as
this
,
by
establishing
insurance
offices
everywhere
for
securing
people
from
shipwreck
and
several
other
accidents
in
their
voyage
to
this
country
;
and
these
officers
shall
furnish
,
at
a
certain
rate
,
pilots
well
versed
in
the
route
,
and
that
know
all
the
rocks
,
shelves
,
quicksands
,
&
c.
,
that
such
pilgrims
and
travellers
may
be
exposed
to
.
 
<EOS>
Of
these
he
knows
a
great
number
ready
instructed
in
most
countries
;
but
the
whole
scheme
of
this
matter
he
is
to
draw
up
at
large
and
communicate
to
his
friend
.
